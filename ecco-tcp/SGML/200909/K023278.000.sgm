<HEAD>PREFACE TO THE ENGLISH EDITION.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the part Mr. Burke took in the American Revolution, it was natural that I &s;hould con&s;ider him a friend to mankind; and as our acquaintance commenced on that ground, it would have been more agreeable to me to have had cau&s;e to continue in that opinion, than to change it.</P>
<P>At the time Mr. Burke made his violent &s;peech la&s;t winter in the Engli&s;h Parliament again&s;t the French Revolution and the Na|tional A&s;&s;embly, I was in Paris, and had written him, but a &s;hort time before, to in|form him how pro&s;perou&s;ly matters were going on. Soon after this, I &s;aw his adver|ti&s;ement of the Pamphlet he intended to pub|li&s;h: As the attack was to be made in a language but little &s;tudied, and le&s;s under&s;tood, in France, and as every thing &s;uffers by tran&s;lation, I promi&s;ed &s;ome of the friends of the Revolution in that country, that when|ever Mr. Burke's Pamphlet came forth, I
<PB N="viii" REF="3">
would an&s;wer it. This appeared to me the more nece&s;&s;ary to be done, when I &s;aw the flagrant mi&s;repre&s;entations which Mr. Burke's Pamphlet contains; and that while it is an outrageous abu&s;e on the French Revolution, and the principles of Liberty, it is an impo|&s;ition on the re&s;t of the world.</P>
<P>I am the more a&s;toni&s;hed and di&s;appointed at this conduct in Mr. Burke, as (from the circum&s;tance I am going to mention), I had formed other expectations.</P>
<P>I had &s;een enough of the mi&s;eries of war, to wi&s;h it might never more have exi&s;tence in the world, and that &s;ome other mode might be found out to &s;ettle the differences that &s;hould occa|&s;ionally ari&s;e in the neighbourhood of nations. This certainly might be done if Courts were di&s;po&s;ed to &s;et hone&s;tly about it, or if coun|tries were enlightened enough not to be made the dupes of Courts. The people of America had been bred up in the &s;ame prejudices again&s;t France, which at that time character|ized the people of England; but experience and an acquaintance with the French Nation have mo&s;t effectually &s;hown to the Americans the fal&s;ehood of tho&s;e prejudices; and I do not believe that a more cordial and confiden|tial intercour&s;e exi&s;ts between any two coun|tries than between America and France.</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="4">When I came to France in the Spring of 1787, the Archbi&s;hop of Thoulou&s;e was then Mini&s;ter, and at that time highly e&s;teemed. I became much acquainted with the private Secretary of that Mini&s;ter, a man of an enlar|ged benevolent heart; and found, that his &s;entiments and my own perfectly agreed with re&s;pect to the madne&s;s of war, and the wretched impolicy of two nations, like Eng|land and France, continually worrying each other, to no other end than that of a mutual increa&s;e of burdens and taxes. That I might be a&s;&s;ured I had not mi&s;under&s;tood him, nor he me, I put the &s;ub&s;tance of our opinions into writing, and &s;ent it to him; &s;ubjoining a reque&s;t, that if I &s;hould &s;ee among the peo|ple of England, any di&s;po&s;ition to cultivate a better under&s;tanding between the two nations than had hitherto prevailed, how far I might be authorized to &s;ay that the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition prevailed on the part of France? He an|&s;wered me by letter in the mo&s;t unre&s;erved manner, and that not for him&s;elf only, but for the Mini&s;ter, with who&s;e knowledge the letter was declared to be written.</P>
<P>I put this letter into the hands of Mr. Burke almo&s;t three years ago, and left it with him, where it &s;till remains; hoping, and at the &s;ame time naturally expecting, from the opi|nion
<PB N="x" REF="5">
I had conceived of him, that he would find &s;ome opportunity of making a good u&s;e of it, for the purpo&s;e of removing tho&s;e errors and prejudices, which two neighbouring na|tions, from the want of knowing each other, had entertained, to the injury of both.</P>
<P>When the French Revolution broke out, it certainly afforded to Mr. Burke an opportu|nity of doing &s;ome good, had he been di&s;po&s;ed to it; in&s;tead of which, no &s;ooner did he &s;ee the old prejudices wearing away, than he immediately began &s;owing the &s;eeds of a new inveteracy, as if he were afraid that England and France would cea&s;e to be enemies. That there are men in all countries who get their living by war, and by keeping up the quar|rels of Nations, is as &s;hocking as it is true; but when tho&s;e who are concerned in the go|vernment of a country, make it their &s;tudy to &s;ow di&s;cord, and cultivate prejudices between Nations, it becomes the more unpardonable.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to a paragraph in this Work alluding to Mr. Burke's having a pen&s;ion, the report has been &s;ome time in circulation, at lea&s;t two months; and as a per&s;on is often the la&s;t to hear what concerns him the mo&s;t to know, I have mentioned it, that Mr. Burke may have an opportunity of contradicting the rumour, if he thinks proper.</P>

<HEAD><HI>RIGHTS OF MAN,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the incivilities by which nations or individuals provoke and irritate each other, Mr. Burke's pamphlet on the French Revolution is an extraordinary in&s;tance. Neither the People of France, nor the National A&s;&s;embly, were troubling them&s;elves about the affairs of England, or the Engli&s;h Parliament; and why Mr. Burke &s;hould commence an unprovoked attack upon them, both in parliament and in public, is a con|duct that cannot be pardoned on the &s;core of manners, nor ju&s;tified on that of policy.</P>
<P>There is &s;carcely an epithet of abu&s;e to be found in the Engli&s;h language, with which Mr. Burke has not loaded the French Nation and the National A&s;&s;embly. Every thing which rancour, prejudice, ignorance, or knowledge could &s;ugge&s;t, are poured forth in the copious fury of near four hundred pages. In the &s;train and on the plan Mr. Burke was writing, he might have written on to as many thou&s;ands. When the tongue or the
<PB N="8" REF="8">
pen is let loo&s;e in a frenzy of pa&s;&s;ion, it is the man, and not the &s;ubject, that becomes ex|hau&s;ted.</P>
<P>Hitherto Mr. Burke has been mi&s;taken and di&s;appointed in the opinions he had formed of the affairs of France; but &s;uch is the ingenuity of his hope, or the malignancy of his de&s;pair, that it furni&s;hes him with new pretences to go on. There was a time when it was impo&s;&s;ible to make Mr. Burke believe there would be any revolution in France. His opinion then was, that the French had neither &s;pirit to undertake it, nor fortitude to &s;upport it; and now that there is one, he &s;eeks an e&s;cape, by condemning it.</P>
<P>Not &s;ufficiently content with abu&s;ing the Na|tional A&s;&s;embly, a great part of his work is taken up with abu&s;ing Dr. Price (one of the be&s;t-hearted men that lives), and the two &s;ocieties in England known by the name of the Revolution Society, and the Society for Con&s;titutional Information.</P>
<P>Dr. Price had preached a &s;ermon on the 4th of November 1789, being the anniver&s;ary of what is called in England, the Revolution which took place 1688. Mr. Burke, &s;peaking of this &s;ermon, &s;ays, <Q>The Political Divine proceeds dogmati|cally to a&s;&s;ert, that, by the principles of the Revolution, the people of England have ac|quired three fundamental rights:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. To choo&s;e our own governors.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. To ca&s;hier them for mi&s;conduct.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. To frame a government for our&s;elves.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="9">Dr. Price does not &s;ay that the right to do the&s;e things exi&s;ts in this or in that per&s;on, or in this or in that de&s;cription of per&s;ons, but that it exi&s;ts in the <HI>whole;</HI> that it is a right re&s;ident in the nation. &mdash;Mr. Burke, on the contrary, denies that &s;uch a right exi&s;ts in the nation, either in whole or in part, or that it exi&s;ts any where; and, what is &s;till more &s;trange and marvellous, he &s;ays, <Q>that the people of England utterly di&s;claim &s;uch a right, and that they will re&s;i&s;t the practical a&s;&s;ertion of it with their lives and fortunes.</Q> That men &s;hould take up arms, and &s;pend their lives and fortunes, <HI>not</HI> to maintain their rights, but to maintain they have <HI>not</HI> rights, is an entire new &s;pecies of di&s;|covery, and &s;uited to the paradoxial genius of Mr. Burke.</P>
<P>The method which Mr. Burke takes to prove that the people of England have no &s;uch rights, and that &s;uch rights do not now exi&s;t in the nation, either in whole or in part, or any where at all, is of the &s;ame marvellous and mon&s;trous kind with what he has already &s;aid; for his arguments are, that the per&s;ons, or the generation of per&s;ons, in whom they did exi&s;t, are dead, and with them the right is dead al&s;o. To prove this, he quotes a declaration made by parliament about a hundred years ago, to William and Mary, in the&s;e words: <Q>The Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Com|mons, do, in the name of the people afore&s;aid, &mdash;(meaning the people of England then living)&mdash; mo&s;t humbly and faithfully <HI>&s;ubmit</HI> them&s;elves, their <HI>heirs</HI> and <HI>po&s;terities,</HI> for EVER.</Q> He al&s;o
<PB N="10" REF="10">
quotes a clau&s;e of another act of parliament made in the &s;ame reign, the terms of which, he &s;ays, <Q>binds us&mdash;(meaning the people of that day)&mdash; our <HI>heirs,</HI> and our <HI>po&s;terity,</HI> to <HI>them,</HI> their <HI>heirs</HI> and <HI>po&s;terity,</HI> to the end of time.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Burke conceives his point &s;ufficiently e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by producing tho&s;e clau&s;es, which he en|forces by &s;aying that they exclude the right of the nation for <HI>ever:</HI> And not yet content with making &s;uch declarations, repeated over and over again, he further &s;ays, <Q>that if the people of England po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch a right before the Revolution, (which he acknowledges to have been the ca&s;e, not only in England, but throughout Europe, at an early period), yet that the <HI>Engli&s;h nation</HI> did, at the time of the Revolution, mo&s;t &s;olemnly renounce and abdicate it, for them&s;elves, and for <HI>all their po&s;terity, for ever.</HI></Q></P>
<P>As Mr. Burke occa&s;ionally applies the poi&s;on drawn from his horrid principles, (if it is not a profanation to call them by the name of princi|ples), not only to the Engli&s;h nation, but to the French Revolution and the National A&s;&s;embly, and charges that augu&s;t, illuminated and illumi|nating body of men with the epithet of <HI>u&s;urpers,</HI> I &s;hall, <HI>&s;ans ceremonie,</HI> place another &s;y&s;tem of principles in oppo&s;ition to his.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h Parliament of 1688 did a certain thing, which, for them&s;elves and their con&s;ti|tuents, they had a right to do, and which it ap|peared right &s;hould be done: But, in addition to this right, which they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by delegation,
<PB N="11" REF="11">
<HI>they &s;et up another right by a&s;&s;umption,</HI> that of bind|ing and controuling po&s;terity to the end of time. The ca&s;e, therefore, divides it&s;elf into two parts; the right which they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by delegation, and the right which they &s;et up by a&s;&s;umption. The fir&s;t is admitted; but, with re&s;pect to the &s;econd, I reply&mdash;</P>
<P>There never did, there never will, and there never can exi&s;t a parliament, or any de&s;cription of men, or any generation of men, in any coun|try, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the right or the power of binding and controuling po&s;terity to the <HI>"end of time,"</HI> or of commanding for ever how the world &s;hall be governed, or who &s;hall govern it; and there|fore, all &s;uch clau&s;es, acts or declarations, by which the makers of them attempt to do what they have neither the right nor the power to do, nor the power to execute, are in them&s;elves null and void.&mdash;Every age and generation mu&s;t be as free to act for it&s;elf, <HI>in all ca&s;es,</HI> as the ages and generations which preceded it. The vanity and pre&s;umption of governing beyond the grave, is the mo&s;t ridiculous and in&s;olent of all tyrannies. Man has no property in man; neither has any generation a property in the generations which are to follow. The parliament or the people of 1688, or of any other period, had no more right to di&s;po&s;e of the people of the pre&s;ent day, or to bind or to controul them <HI>in any &s;hape whatever,</HI> than the parliament or the people of the pre&s;ent day have to di&s;po&s;e of, bind or controul tho&s;e who are to live a hundred or a thou&s;and years hence.
<PB N="12" REF="12">
Every generation is, and mu&s;t be, competent to all the purpo&s;es which its occa&s;ions require. It is the living, and not the dead, that are to be ac|commodated. When man cea&s;es to be, his power and his wants cea&s;e with him; and having no longer any participation in the concerns of this world, he has no longer any authority in direct|ing who &s;hall be its governors, or how its govern|ment &s;hall be organized, or how admini&s;tered.</P>
<P>I am not contending for nor again&s;t any form of government, nor for nor again&s;t any party here or el&s;ewhere. That which a whole nation choo&s;es to do, it has a right to do. Mr. Burke &s;ays, No. Where then <HI>does</HI> the right exi&s;t? I am contend|ing for the rights of the <HI>living,</HI> and again&s;t their being willed away, and controuled and contracted for, by the manu&s;cript a&s;&s;umed authority of the dead; and Mr. Burke is contending for the au|thority of the dead over the rights and freedom of the living. There was a time when kings di&s;po&s;ed of their crowns by will upon their death|beds, and con&s;igned the people, like bea&s;ts of the field, to whatever &s;ucce&s;&s;or they appointed. This is now &s;o exploded as &s;carcely to be remem|bered, and &s;o mon&s;trous as hardly to be believed: But the parliamentary clau&s;es upon which Mr. Burke builds his political church, are of the &s;ame nature.</P>
<P>The laws of every country mu&s;t be analogous to &s;ome common principle. In England, no parent or ma&s;ter, nor all the authority of par|liament, omnipotent as it has called it&s;elf, can
<PB N="13" REF="13">
bind or controul the per&s;onal freedom even of an individual beyond the age of twenty-one years: On what ground of right, then, could the parlia|ment of 1688, or any other parliament, bind all po&s;terity for ever?</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have quitted the world, and tho&s;e who are not yet arrived at it, are as remote from each other, as the utmo&s;t &s;tretch of mortal imagi|nation can conceive: What po&s;&s;ible obligation, then, can exi&s;t between them; what rule or prin|ciple can be laid down, that two non-entities, the one out of exi&s;tence, and the other not in, and who never can meet in this world, that the one &s;hould controul the other to the end of time?</P>
<P>In England, it is &s;aid that money cannot be taken out of the pockets of the people without their con&s;ent: But who authorized, or who could authorize the parliament of 1688 to controul and take away the freedom of po&s;terity, and limit and confine their right of acting in certain ca&s;es for ever, who were not in exi&s;tence to give or to with|hold their con&s;ent?</P>
<P>A greater ab&s;urdity cannot pre&s;ent it&s;elf to the under&s;tanding of man, than what Mr. Burke offers to his readers. He tells them, and he tells the world to come, that a certain body of men, who exi&s;ted a hundred years ago, made a law; and that there does not now exi&s;t in the nation, nor ever will, nor ever can, a power to alter it. Un|der how many &s;ubtilties, or ab&s;urdities, has the divine right to govern been impo&s;ed on the cre|dulity of mankind! Mr. Burke has di&s;covered a
<PB N="14" REF="14">
new one, and he has &s;hortened his journey to Rome, by appealing to the power of this infal|lible parliament of former days; and he produces what it has done, as of divine authority: for that power mu&s;t certainly be more than human, which no human power to the end of time can alter.</P>
<P>But Mr. Burke has done &s;ome &s;ervice, not to his cau&s;e, but to his country, by bringing tho&s;e clau&s;es into public view. They &s;erve to demon|&s;trate how nece&s;&s;ary it is at all times to watch again&s;t the attempted encroachment of power, and to prevent its running to exce&s;s. It is &s;ome|what extraordinary, that the offence for which James II. was expelled, that of &s;etting up power by <HI>a&s;&s;umption,</HI> &s;hould be re-acted, under another &s;hape and form, by the parliament that expelled him. It &s;hews, that the rights of man were but imperfectly under&s;tood at the Revolution; for, certain it is, that the right which that parliament &s;et up by <HI>a&s;&s;umption</HI> (for by delegation it had it not, and could not have it, becau&s;e none could give it) over the per&s;ons and freedom of po&s;terity for ever, was of the &s;ame tyrannical un&s;ounded kind which James attempted to &s;et up over the parliament and the nation, and for which he was expelled. The only difference is, (for in principle they dif|fer not), that the one was an u&s;urper over the living, and the other over the unborn; and as the one has no better authority to &s;tand upon than the other, both of them mu&s;t be equally null and void, and of no effect.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="15">From what, or from whence, does Mr. Burke prove the right of any human power to bind po&s;|terity for ever? He has produced his clau&s;es; but he mu&s;t produce al&s;o his proofs, that &s;uch a right exi&s;ted, and &s;hew how it exi&s;ted. If it ever exi&s;t|ed, it mu&s;t now exi&s;t; for whatever appertains to the nature of man, cannot be annihilated by man. It is the nature of man to die, and he will continue to die as long as he continues to be born. But Mr. Burke has &s;et up a &s;ort of political Adam, in whom all po&s;terity are bound for ever; he mu&s;t therefore prove that his Adam po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch a power, or &s;uch a right.</P>
<P>The weaker any cord is, the le&s;s will it bear to be &s;tretched, and the wor&s;e is the policy to &s;tretch it, unle&s;s it is intended to break it. Had a per&s;on contemplated the overthrow of Mr. Burke's po&s;i|tions, he would have proceeded as Mr. Burke has done. He would have magnified the authorities, on purpo&s;e to have called the <HI>right</HI> of them into que&s;tion; and the in&s;tant the que&s;tion of right was &s;tarted, the authorities mu&s;t have been given up.</P>
<P>It requires but a very &s;mall glance of thought to perceive, that altho' laws made in one generation often continue in force through &s;ucceeding genera|tions, yet that they continue to derive their force from the con&s;ent of the living. A law not re|pealed continues in force, not becau&s;e it <HI>cannot</HI> be repealed, but becau&s;e it <HI>is not</HI> repealed; and the non-repealing pa&s;&s;es for con&s;ent.</P>
<P>But Mr. Burke's clau&s;es have not even this quali|fication in their favour. They become null, by
<PB N="16" REF="16">
attempting to become immortal. The nature of them precludes con&s;ent. They de&s;troy the right which they <HI>might</HI> have, by grounding it on a right which they <HI>cannot</HI> have. Immortal power is not a human right, and therefore cannot be a right of parliament. The parliament of 1688 might as well have pa&s;&s;ed an act to have authorized them|&s;elves to live for ever, as to make their authority live for ever. All therefore that can be &s;aid of them is, that they are a formality of words, of as much im|port, as if tho&s;e who u&s;ed them had addre&s;&s;ed a con|gratulation to them&s;elves, and, in the oriental &s;tile of antiquity, had &s;aid, O Parliament, live for ever!</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances of the world are continully changing, and the opinions of men change al&s;o; and as government is for the living, and not for the dead, it is the living only that has any right in it. That which may be thought right and found convenient in one age, may be thought wrong and found inconvenient in another. In &s;uch ca&s;es, Who is to decide, the living, or the dead?</P>
<P>As almo&s;t one hundred pages of Mr. Burke's book are employed upon the&s;e clau&s;es, it will con|&s;equently follow, that if the clau&s;es them&s;elves, &s;o far as they &s;et up an <HI>a&s;&s;umed, u&s;urped</HI> dominion over po&s;terity for ever, are unauthoritative, and in their nature null and void; that all his voluminous inferences and declamation drawn therefrom, or founded thereon, are null and void al&s;o: and on this ground I re&s;t the matter.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="17">We now come more particularly to the affairs of France. Mr. Burke's book has the appear|ance of being written as in&s;truction to the French nation; but if I may permit my&s;elf the u&s;e of an extravagant metaphor, &s;uited to the extravagance of the ca&s;e, It is darkne&s;s attempting to illumi|nate light.</P>
<P>While I am writing this, there are accidentally before me &s;ome propo&s;als for a declaration of rights by the Marquis de la Fayette (I a&s;k his pardon for u&s;ing his former addre&s;s, and do it only for di&s;tinc|tion's &s;ake) to the National A&s;&s;embly, on the 11th of July 1789, three days before the taking of the Ba|&s;tille; and I cannot but be &s;truck by ob&s;erving how oppo&s;ite the &s;ources are from which that Gentleman and Mr. Burke draw their principles. In&s;tead of referring to mu&s;ty records and mouldy parchments to prove that the rights of the living are lo&s;t, <Q>re|nounced and abdicated for ever,</Q> by tho&s;e who are now no more, as Mr. Burke has done, M. de la Fayette applies to the living world, and empha|tically &s;ays, <Q>Call to mind the &s;entiments which Nature has engraved in the heart of every citizen, and which take a new force when they are &s;o|lemnly recognized by all:&mdash;For a nation to love liberty, it is &s;ufficient that &s;he knows it; and to be free, it is &s;ufficient that &s;he wills it.</Q> How dry, barren, and ob&s;cure, is the &s;ource from which Mr. Burke labours! and how ineffectual, though gay with flowers, are all his declamation and his argument, compared with the&s;e clear, conci&s;e, and &s;oul-animating &s;entiments! Few and &s;hort as they

are, they lead on to a va&s;t field of generous and manly thinking, and do not fini&s;h, like Mr. Burke's periods, with mu&s;ic in the ear, and nothing in the heart.</P>
<P>As I have introduced M. de la Fayette, I will take the liberty of adding an anecdote re|&s;pecting his farewel addre&s;s to the Congre&s;s of America in 1783, and which occurred fre&s;h to my mind when I &s;aw Mr. Burke's thundering at|tack on the French Revolution.&mdash;M. de la Fayette went to America at an early period of the war, and continued a volunteer in her &s;ervice to the end. His conduct through the whole of that enterpri&s;e is one of the mo&s;t extraordinary that is to be found in the hi&s;tory of a young man, &s;carcely then twenty years of age. Situated in a country that was like the lap of &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure, and with the means of enjoying it, how few are there to be found who would exchange &s;uch a &s;cene for the woods and wilderne&s;&s;es of America, and pa&s;s the flowery years of youth in unprofitable danger and hard&s;hip! but &s;uch is the fact. When the war ended, and he was on the point of taking his final departure, he pre|&s;ented him&s;elf to Congre&s;s, and contemplating, in his affectionate farewel, the revolution he had &s;een, expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in the&s;e words: <Q>May this great monument, rai&s;ed to Liberty, &s;erve as a le&s;&s;on to the oppre&s;&s;or, and an example to the oppre&s;&s;ed!</Q> &mdash;When this addre&s;s came to the hands of Doctor Franklin, who was then in France, he applied to Count Vergennes to have it in&s;erted in the French Gazette, but never could obtain his con&s;ent. The
<PB N="19" REF="19">
fact was, that Count Vergennes was an ari&s;to|cratical de&s;pot at home, and dreaded the example of the American revolution in France, as certain other per&s;ons now dread the example of the French revolution in England; and Mr. Burke's tribute of fear (for in this light his book mu&s;t be con&s;idered) runs parallel with Count Vergennes' refu&s;al. But, to return more particularly to his work&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>We have &s;een (&s;ays Mr. Burke) the French rebel again&s;t a mild and lawful Monarch, with more fury, outrage, and in&s;ult, than any people has been known to ri&s;e again&s;t the mo&s;t illegal u&s;urper, or the mo&s;t &s;anguinary tyrant.</Q>&mdash;This is one among a thou&s;and other in&s;tances, in which Mr. Burke &s;hews that he is ignorant of the &s;prings and principles of the French revolution.</P>
<P>It was not again&s;t Louis the XVIth, but again&s;t the de&s;potic principles of the government, that the nation revolted. The&s;e principles had not their origin in him, but in the original e&s;tabli&s;hment, many centuries back; and they were become too deeply rooted to be removed, and the augean &s;table of para&s;ites and plunderers too abominably filthy to be clean&s;ed, by any thing &s;hort of a complete and univer&s;al revolution. When it becomes nece&s;|&s;ary to do a thing, the whole heart and &s;oul &s;hould go into the mea&s;ure, or not attempt it. That cri&s;is was then arrived, and there remained no choice but to act with determined vigour, or not to act at all. The king was known to be the friend of the nation, and this circum&s;tance was favourable to the enter|pri&s;e. Perhaps no man bred up in the &s;tile of an
<PB N="20" REF="20">
ab&s;olute King, ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a heart &s;o little di&s;po|&s;ed to the exerci&s;e of that &s;pecies of power as the pre&s;ent King of France. But the principles of the government it&s;elf &s;till remained the &s;ame. The Monarch and the Monarchy were di&s;tinct and &s;epa|rate things; and it was again&s;t the e&s;tabli&s;hed de&s;poti&s;m of the latter, and not again&s;t the per|&s;on or principles of the former, that the revolt commenced, and the revolution has been carried.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke does not attend to the di&s;tinction between <HI>men</HI> and <HI>principles;</HI> and therefore, he does not &s;ee that a revolt may take place again&s;t the de&s;|poti&s;m of the latter, while there lies no charge of de&s;poti&s;m again&s;t the former.</P>
<P>The natural moderation of Louis XVI. contri|buted nothing to alter the hereditary de&s;poti&s;m of the monarchy. All the tyrannies of former reigns, acted under that hereditary de&s;poti&s;m, were &s;till liable to be revived in the hands of a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or. It was not the re&s;pite of a reign that would &s;atisfy France, enlightened as &s;he was then become. A ca&s;ual di&s;continuance of the <HI>practice</HI> of de&s;poti&s;m, is not a di&s;continuance of its <HI>princi|ples;</HI> the former depends on the virtue of the in|dividual who is in immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the power; the latter, on the virtue and fortitude of the nation. In the ca&s;e of Charles I. and James II. of England, the revolt was again&s;t the per&s;onal de&s;poti&s;m of the men; whereas in France, it was again&s;t the hereditary de&s;poti&s;m of the e&s;tabli&s;hed government. But men who can con&s;ign over the
<PB N="21" REF="21">
rights of po&s;terity for ever on the authority of a mouldy parchment, like Mr. Burke, are not qua|lified to judge of this revolution. It takes in a field too va&s;t for their views to explore, and pro|ceeds with a mightine&s;s of rea&s;on they cannot keep pace with.</P>
<P>But there are many points of view in which this revolution may be con&s;idered. When de&s;po|ti&s;m has e&s;tabli&s;hed it&s;elf for ages in a country, as in France, it is not in the per&s;on of the King only that it re&s;ides. It has the appearance of being &s;o in &s;how, and in nominal authority; but it is not &s;o in practice, and in fact. It has its &s;tandard every-where. Every office and department has its de&s;poti&s;m, founded upon cu&s;tom and u&s;age. Every place has its Ba&s;tille, and every Ba&s;tille its de&s;pot. The original hereditary de&s;poti&s;m re&s;i|dent in the per&s;on of the King, divides and &s;ubdi|vides it&s;elf into a thou&s;and &s;hapes and forms, till at la&s;t the whole of it is acted by deputation. This was the ca&s;e in France; and again&s;t this &s;pecies of de&s;poti&s;m, proceeding on through an endle&s;s labyrinth of office till the &s;ource of it is &s;carcely perceptible, there is no mode of redre&s;s. It &s;trengthens it&s;elf by a&s;&s;uming the appearance of duty, and tyranni&s;es under the pretence of obey|ing.</P>
<P>When a man reflects on the condition which France was in from the nature of her govern|ment, he will &s;ee other cau&s;es for revolt than tho&s;e which immediately connect them&s;elves with the per&s;on or character of Louis XVI. There were,
<PB N="22" REF="22">
if I may &s;o expre&s;s it, a thou&s;and de&s;poti&s;ms to be reformed in France, which had grown up un|der the hereditary de&s;poti&s;m of the monarchy, and became &s;o rooted as to be in a great mea&s;ure inde|pendent of it. Between the monarchy, the par|liament, and the church, there was a <HI>rival&s;hip</HI> of de&s;poti&s;m; be&s;ides the feudal de&s;poti&s;m operating locally, and the mini&s;terial de&s;poti&s;m operating every-where. But Mr. Burke, by con&s;idering the King as the only po&s;&s;ible object of a revolt, &s;peaks as if France was a village, in which every thing that pa&s;&s;ed mu&s;t be known to its commanding officer, and no oppre&s;&s;ion could be acted but what he could immediately controul. Mr. Burke might have been in the Ba&s;tille his whole life, as well under Louis XVI. as Louis XIV. and neither the one nor the other have known that &s;uch a man as Mr. Burke exi&s;ted. The de&s;potic principles of the government were the &s;ame in both reigns, though the di&s;po&s;itions of the men were as remote as tyranny and benevolence.</P>
<P>What Mr. Burke con&s;iders as a reproach to the French Revolution (that of bringing it for|ward under a reign more mild than the preced|ing ones), is one of its highe&s;t honours. The revolutions that have taken place in other Euro|pean countries, have been excited by per&s;onal hatred. The rage was again&s;t the man, and he became the victim. But, in the in&s;tance of France, we &s;ee a revolution generated in the rational contemplation of the rights of man, and di&s;|tingui&s;hing
<PB N="23" REF="23">
from the beginning between per&s;ons and principles.</P>
<P>But Mr. Burke appears to have no idea of principles, when he is contemplating governments. <Q>Ten years ago (&s;ays he) I could have felicitated France on her having a government, without enquiring what the nature of that government was, or how it was admini&s;tered.</Q> Is this the language of a rationable man? Is it the language of a heart feeling as it ought to feel for the rights and happine&s;s of the human race? On this ground, Mr. Burke mu&s;t compliment every go|vernment in the world, while the victims who &s;uffer under them, whether &s;old into &s;lavery, or tortured out of exi&s;tence, are wholly forgotten. It is power, and not principles, that Mr. Burke venerates; and under this abominable depravity, he is di&s;qualified to judge between them.&mdash;Thus much for his opinion as to the occa&s;ions of the French Revolution. I now proceed to other con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>I know a place in America called Point-no-Point; becau&s;e as you proceed along the &s;hore, gay and flowery as Mr. Burke's language, it con|tinually recedes and pre&s;ents it&s;elf at a di&s;tance before you; but when you have got as far as you can go, there is no point at all. Ju&s;t thus it is with Mr. Burke's three hundred and fifty-&s;ix pages. It is therefore difficult to reply to him. But as the points he wi&s;hes to e&s;tabli&s;h, may be inferred from what he abu&s;es, it is in his paradoxes that we mu&s;t look for his arguments.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="24">As to the tragic paintings by which Mr. Burke has outraged his own imagination, and &s;eeks to work upon that of his readers, they are very well calculated for theatrical repre&s;entation, where facts are manufactured for the &s;ake of &s;how, and accommodated to produce, through the weakne&s;s of &s;ympathy, a weeping effect. But Mr. Burke &s;hould recollect that he is writing Hi&s;tory, and not <HI>Plays;</HI> and that his readers will expect truth, and not the &s;pouting rant of high-toned exclama|tion.</P>
<P>When we &s;ee a man dramatically lamenting in a publication intended to be believed, that, <Q>The age of chivalry is gone! <HI>that</HI> The glory of Europe is ex|tingui&s;hed for ever! <HI>that</HI> The unbought grace of life <HI>(if any one knows what it is),</HI> the cheap defence of nations, the nur&s;e of manly &s;entiment and heroic enter|prize, is gone!</Q> and all this becau&s;e the Quixote age of chivalry non&s;en&s;e is gone, What opinion can we form of his judgment, or what regard can we pay to his facts? In the rhap&s;ody of his imagination, he has di&s;covered a world of wind-mills, and his &s;or|rows are, that there are no Quixotes to attack them. But if the age of ari&s;tocracy, like that of chivalry, &s;hould fall, and they had originally &s;ome connection, Mr. Burke, the trumpeter of the Or|der, may continue his parody to the end, and fini&s;h with exclaiming&mdash;<HI>"Othello's occupation's gone!"</HI></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding Mr. Burke's horrid paintings, when the French Revolution is compared with that of other countries, the a&s;toni&s;hment will be, that it is marked with &s;o few &s;acrifices; but this
<PB N="25" REF="25">
a&s;toni&s;hment will cea&s;e when we reflect that <HI>principles,</HI> and not <HI>per&s;ons,</HI> were the meditated objects of de&s;truction. The mind of the nation was acted upon by a higher &s;timulus than what the con&s;ideration of per&s;ons could in&s;pire, and &s;ought a higher conque&s;t than could be produced by the downfal of an enemy. Among the few who fell, there do not appear to be any that were intentionally &s;ingled out. They all of them had their fate in the circum&s;tances of the moment, and were not pur&s;ued with that long, cold-blooded, unabated revenge which pur&s;ued the unfortunate Scotch in the affair of 1745.</P>
<P>Through the whole of Mr. Burke's book I do not ob&s;erve that the Ba&s;tille is mentioned more than once, and that with a kind of implication as if he were &s;orry it was pulled down, and wi&s;hed it were built up again. <Q>We have rebuilt New|gate (&s;ays he), and tenanted the man&s;ion; and we have pri&s;ons almo&s;t as &s;trong as the Ba&s;tille for tho&s;e who dare to libel the Queens of France<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since writing the above, two other places occur in Mr. Burke's pamphlet, in which the name of the Ba&s;tille is mentioned, but in the &s;ame manner. In the one, he introduces it in a &s;ort of ob&s;cure que&s;tion, and a&s;ks&mdash;"Will any mini&s;ters who now &s;erve &s;uch a king, with but a decent appearance of re&s;pect, cordially obey the orders of tho&s;e whom but the other day, <HI>in his name,</HI> they had committed to the Ba&s;tille?" In the other, the taking it is mentioned as implying criminality in the French guards who a&s;&s;i&s;ted in demoli&s;hing it.&mdash; "They have not (&s;ays he) forgot the taking the king's ca&s;tles at Paris."&mdash;This is Mr. Burke, who pretends to write on con&s;titu|tional freedom.</NOTE>.</Q> As to what a madman, like the per&s;on called Lord G&mdash; G&mdash;, might &s;ay, and to
<PB N="26" REF="26">
whom Newgate is rather a bedlam than a pri&s;on, it is unworthy a rational con&s;ideration. It was a madman that libelled &mdash; and that is &s;ufficient apology; and it afforded an opportunity for con|fining him, which was the thing that was wi&s;hed for: But certain it is that Mr. Burke, who does not call him&s;elf a madman, whatever other people may do, has libelled, in the mo&s;t unprovoked man|ner, and in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t &s;tile of the mo&s;t vulgar abu&s;e, the whole repre&s;entative authority of France; and yet Mr. Burke takes his &s;eat in the Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons! From his violence and his grief, his &s;ilence on &s;ome points, and his exce&s;s on others, it is difficult not to believe that Mr. Burke is &s;orry, extremely &s;orry, that arbitrary power, the power of the Pope, and the Ba&s;tille, are pulled down.</P>
<P>Not one glance of compa&s;&s;ion, not one commi|&s;erating reflection, that I can find throughout his book, has he be&s;towed on tho&s;e who lingered out the mo&s;t wretched of lives, a life without hope, in the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of pri&s;ons. It is painful to be|hold a man employing his talents to corrupt him|&s;elf. Nature has been kinder to Mr. Burke than he is to her. He is not affected by the reality of di&s;tre&s;s touching his heart, but by the &s;howy re&s;emblance of it &s;triking his imagination. He pities the plumage, but forgets the dying bird. Accu&s;tomed to ki&s;s the ari&s;tocratical hand that hath purloined him from him&s;elf, he degenerates into a compo&s;ition of art, and the genuine &s;oul of nature for&s;akes him. His hero or his heroine mu&s;t
<PB N="27" REF="27">
be a tragedy-victim expiring in &s;how, and not the real pri&s;oner of mi&s;ery, &s;liding into death in the &s;ilence of a dungeon.</P>
<P>As Mr. Burke has pa&s;&s;ed over the whole tran&s;ac|tion of the Ba&s;tille (and his &s;ilence is nothing in his favour), and has entertained his readers with reflec|tions on &s;uppo&s;ed facts di&s;torted into real fal&s;e|hoods, I will give, &s;ince he has not, &s;ome account of the circum&s;tances which preceded that tran&s;ac|tion. They will &s;erve to &s;hew, that le&s;s mi&s;chief could &s;carcely have accompanied &s;uch an event, when con&s;idered with the treacherous and ho&s;tile aggravations of the enemies of the Revolution.</P>
<P>The mind can hardly picture to it&s;elf a more tremendous &s;cene than what the city of Paris exhi|bited at the time of taking the Ba&s;tille, and for two days before and after, nor conceive the po&s;&s;ibility of its quieting &s;o &s;oon. At a di&s;tance, this tran&s;ac|tion has appeared only as an act of heroi&s;m, &s;tand|ing on it&s;elf; and the clo&s;e political connection it had with the Revolution is lo&s;t in the brilliancy of the atchievement. But we are to con&s;ider it as the &s;trength of the parties, brought man to man, and contending for the i&s;&s;ue. The Ba&s;tille was to be either the prize or the pri&s;on of the a&s;&s;ailants. The downfal of it included the idea of the down|fal of De&s;poti&s;m; and this compounded image was become as figuratively united as Bunyan's Doubt|ing Ca&s;tle and Giant De&s;pair.</P>
<P>The National A&s;&s;embly, before and at the time of taking the Ba&s;tille, was &s;itting at Ver&s;ailles, twelve miles di&s;tant from Paris. About a week before the
<PB N="28" REF="28">
ri&s;ing of the Pari&s;ians, and their taking the Ba&s;tille, it was di&s;covered that a plot was forming, at the head of which was the Count d'Artois, the King's younge&s;t brother, for demoli&s;hing the National A&s;|&s;embly, &s;eizing its members, and thereby cru&s;hing, by a <HI>coup de main,</HI> all hopes and pro&s;pects of form|ing a free government. For the &s;ake of humanity, as well as of freedom, it is well this plan did not &s;ucceed. Examples are not wanting to &s;hew how dreadfully vindictive and cruel are all old govern|ments, when they are &s;ucce&s;sful again&s;t what they call a revolt.</P>
<P>This plan mu&s;t have been &s;ome time in con|templation; becau&s;e, in order to carry it into exe|cution, it was nece&s;&s;ary to collect a large military force round Paris, and to cut off the communica|tion between that city and the National A&s;&s;embly at Ver&s;ailles. The troops de&s;tined for this &s;ervice were chiefly the foreign troops in the pay of France, and who, for this particular purpo&s;e, were drawn from the di&s;tant provinces where they were then &s;tationed. When they were collected, to the amount of between twenty-five and thirty thou&s;and, it was judged time to put the plan into execution. The mini&s;try who were then in office, and who were friendly to the Revolution, were in&s;tantly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and a new mini&s;try formed of tho&s;e who had con|certed the project;&mdash;among whom was Count de Broglio, and to his &s;hare was given the command of tho&s;e troops. The character of this man, as de|&s;cribed to me in a letter which I communicated to Mr. Burke before he began to write his book, and
<PB N="29" REF="29">
from an authority which Mr. Burke well knows was good, was that of <Q>an high-flying ari&s;tocrat, cool, and capable of every mi&s;chief.</Q></P>
<P>While the&s;e matters were agitating, the National A&s;&s;embly &s;tood in the mo&s;t perilous and critical &s;ituation that a body of men can be &s;uppo&s;ed to act in. They were the devoted victims, and they knew it. They had the hearts and wi&s;hes of their coun|try on their &s;ide, but military authority they had none. The guards of Broglio &s;urrounded the hall where the a&s;&s;embly &s;at, ready, at the word of com|mand, to &s;eize their per&s;ons, as had been done the year before to the parliament of Paris. Had the National A&s;&s;embly de&s;erted their tru&s;t, or had they exhibited &s;igns of weakne&s;s or fear, their enemies had been encouraged, and the country depre&s;&s;ed. When the &s;ituation they &s;tood in, the cau&s;e they were engaged in, and the cri&s;is then ready to bur&s;t which &s;hould determine their per&s;onal and political fate, and that of their country, and probably of Europe, are taken into one view, none but a heart callous with prejudice, or corrupted by dependance, can avoid intere&s;ting it&s;elf in their &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The archbi&s;hop of Vienne was at this time pre|&s;ident of the National A&s;&s;embly; a per&s;on too old to undergo the &s;cene that a few days, or a few hours, might bring forth. A man of more ac|tivity, and bolder fortitude, was nece&s;&s;ary; and the National A&s;&s;embly cho&s;e (under the form of a vice-pre&s;ident, for the pre&s;idency &s;till re&s;ided in the archbi&s;hop) M. de la Fayette; and this is the only in&s;tance of a vice-pre&s;ident being
<PB N="30" REF="30">
cho&s;en. It was at the moment that this &s;torm was pending (July 11.) that a declaration of rights was brought forward by M. de la Fayette, and is the &s;ame which is alluded to in page 17. It was ha&s;tily drawn up, and makes only a part of a more exten&s;ive declaration of rights, agreed upon and adopted afterwards by the National A&s;|&s;embly. The particular rea&s;on for bringing it forward at this moment, (M. de la Fayette has &s;ince informed me) was, that if the National A&s;|&s;embly &s;hould fall in the threatened de&s;truction that then &s;urrounded it, &s;ome traces of its princi|ples might have the chance of &s;urviving the wreck.</P>
<P>Every thing now was drawing to a cri&s;is. The event was freedom or &s;lavery. On one &s;ide, an army of nearly thirty thou&s;and men; on the other, an unarmed body of citizens: for the citizens of Paris, on whom the National A&s;&s;embly mu&s;t then immediately depend, were as unarmed and as un|di&s;ciplined as the citizens of London are now.&mdash; The French guards had given &s;trong &s;ymptoms of their being attached to the national cau&s;e; but their numbers were &s;mall, not a tenth part of the force that Broglio commanded, and their officers were in the intere&s;t of Broglio.</P>
<P>Matters being now ripe for execution, the new mini&s;try made their appearance in office. The reader will carry in his mind, that the Ba&s;tille was taken the 14th of July: the point of time I am now &s;peaking to, is the 12th. Immediately on the news of the change of mini&s;try reaching Paris, in the afternoon, all the play-hou&s;es and places of
<PB N="31" REF="31">
entertainment, &s;hops and hou&s;es, were &s;hut up. The change of mini&s;try was con&s;idered as the prelude of ho&s;tilities, and the opinion was rightly founded.</P>
<P>The foreign troops began to advance towards the city. The Prince de Lambe&s;c, who commanded a body of German cavalry, approached by the Place of Lewis XV. which connects it&s;elf with &s;ome of the &s;treets. In his march, he in&s;ulted and &s;truck an old man with his &s;word. The French are re|markable for their re&s;pect to old age, and the in|&s;olence with which it appeared to be done, uniting with the general fermentation they were in, pro|duced a powerful effect, and a cry of <HI>To arms! to arms!</HI> &s;pread it&s;elf in a moment over the city.</P>
<P>Arms they had none, nor &s;carcely any who knew the u&s;e of them: but de&s;perate re&s;olution, when every hope is at &s;take, &s;upplies, for a while, the want of arms. Near where the Prince de Lam|be&s;c was drawn up, were large piles of &s;tones collected for building the new bridge, and with the&s;e the people attacked the cavalry. A party of the French guards, upon hearing the firing, ru&s;hed from their quarters and joined the people; and night coming on, the cavalry retreated.</P>
<P>The &s;treets of Paris, being narrow, are favour|able for defence; and the loftine&s;s of the hou&s;es, con&s;i&s;ting of many &s;tories, from which great annoy|ance might be given, &s;ecured them again&s;t noctur|nal enterpri&s;es; and the night was &s;pent in provid|ing them&s;elves with every &s;ort of weapon they could make or procure: Guns, &s;words, black|&s;miths hammers, carpenters axes, iron crows,
<PB N="32" REF="32">
pikes, halberts, pitchforks, &s;pits, clubs, &amp;c. &amp;c. The incredible numbers with which they a&s;&s;em|bled the next morning, and the &s;till more incredible re&s;olution they exhibited, embarra&s;&s;ed and a&s;toni&s;hed their enemies. Little did the new mini&s;try expect &s;uch a &s;alute. Accu&s;tomed to &s;lavery them&s;elves, they had no idea that Li|berty was capable of &s;uch in&s;piration, or that a body of unarmed citizens would dare to face the military force of thirty thou&s;and men. Every moment of this day was employed in collecting arms, concerting plans, and arranging them&s;elves into the be&s;t order which &s;uch an in&s;tantaneous movement could afford. Broglio continued lying round the city, but made no further advances this day, and the &s;ucceeding night pa&s;&s;ed with as much tranquillity as &s;uch a &s;cene could po&s;&s;ibly produce.</P>
<P>But defence only was not the object of the ci|tizens. They had a cau&s;e at &s;take, on which de|pended their freedom or their &s;lavery. They every moment expected an attack, or to hear of one made on the National A&s;&s;embly; and in &s;uch a &s;ituation, the mo&s;t prompt mea&s;ures are &s;ome|times the be&s;t. The object that now pre&s;ented it|&s;elf was the Ba&s;tille; and the eclat of carrying &s;uch a fortre&s;s in the face of &s;uch an army, could not fail to &s;trike a terror into the new mini&s;try, who had &s;carcely yet had time to meet. By &s;ome intercepted corre&s;pondence this morning, it was di&s;covered, that the Mayor of Paris, M.

remained no doubt that Broglio would reinforce the Ba&s;tille the en&s;uing evening. It was therefore nece&s;&s;ary to attack it that day; but before this could be done, it was fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to procure a better &s;upply of arms than they were then po&s;&s;e&s;|ed of.</P>
<P>There was adjoining to the city a large maga|zine of arms depo&s;ited at the Ho&s;pital of the In|valids, which the citizens &s;ummoned to &s;urren|der; and as the place was not defen&s;ible, nor attempted much defence, they &s;oon &s;ucceeded. Thus &s;upplied, they marched to attack the Ba&s;|tille; a va&s;t mixed multitude of all ages, and of all degrees, and armed with all &s;orts of weapons. Imagination would fail in de&s;cribing to it&s;elf the appearance of &s;uch a proce&s;&s;ion, and of the anxie|ty for the events which a few hours or a few minutes might produce. What plans the mini|&s;try was forming, were as unknown to the peo|ple within the city, as what the citizens were doing was unknown to the mini&s;try; and what move|ments Broglio might make for the &s;upport or relief of the place, were to the citizens equally as un|known. All was my&s;tery and hazard.</P>
<P>That the Ba&s;tille was attacked with an enthu&s;i|a&s;m of heroi&s;m, &s;uch only as the highe&s;t animation of liberty could in&s;pire, and carried in the &s;pace of a few hours, is an event which the world is fully po&s;&s;e&s;ed of. I am not undertaking a detail of the attack; but bringing into view the con&s;pi|racy again&s;t the nation which provoked it, and which fell with the Ba&s;tille. The pri&s;on to which
<PB N="34" REF="34">
the new mini&s;try were dooming the National A&s;|&s;embly, in addition to its being the high altar and ca&s;tle of de&s;poti&s;m, became the proper object to begin with. This enterpri&s;e broke up the new mini&s;try, who began now to fly from the ruin they had prepared for others. The troops of Broglio di&s;per&s;ed, and him&s;elf fled al&s;o.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke has &s;poken a great deal about plots, but he has never once &s;poken of this plot again&s;t the National A&s;&s;embly, and the liberties of the nation; and that he might not, he has pa&s;&s;ed over all the circum&s;tances that might throw it in his way. The exiles who have fled from France, who&s;e ca&s;e he &s;o much intere&s;ts him&s;elf in, and from whom he has had his le&s;&s;on, fled in con&s;e|quence of the mi&s;carriage of this plot. No plot was formed again&s;t them: they were plotting again&s;t others; and tho&s;e who fell, met, not unju&s;tly, the puni&s;hment they were preparing to execute. But will Mr. Burke &s;ay, that if this plot, contrived with the &s;ubtilty of an ambu&s;cade, had &s;ucceeded, the &s;ucce&s;sful party would have re&s;trained their wrath &s;o &s;oon? Let the hi&s;tory of all old governments an&s;wer the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Whom has the National A&s;&s;embly brought to the &s;caffold? None. They were them&s;elves the devoted victims of this plot, and they have not re|taliated; why then are they charged with revenge they have not acted? In the tremendous breaking forth of a whole people, in which all degrees, tempers and characters are confounded, and de|livering them&s;elves, by a miracle of exertion,
<PB N="35" REF="35">
from the de&s;truction meditated again&s;t them, is it to be expected that nothing will happen? When men are &s;ore with the &s;en&s;e of oppre&s;&s;ions, and menaced with the pro&s;pect of new ones, is the calmne&s;s of philo&s;ophy, or the pal&s;y of in&s;en&s;i|bility, to be looked for? Mr. Burke exclaims again&s;t outrage; yet the greate&s;t is that which him&s;elf has committed. His book is a volume of outrage, not apologized for by the impul&s;e of a moment, but cheri&s;hed through a &s;pace of ten months; yet Mr. Burke had no provocation&mdash;no life, no intere&s;t at &s;take.</P>
<P>More of the citizens fell in this &s;truggle than of their opponents: but four or five per&s;ons were &s;eized by the populace, and in&s;tantly put to death; the Governor of the Ba&s;tille, and the Mayor of Paris, who was detected in the act of betraying them; and afterwards Foulon, one of the new mi|ni&s;try, and Berthier his &s;on-in-law, who had accep|ted the office of Intendant of Paris. Their heads were &s;tuck upon &s;pikes, and carried about the city; and it is upon this mode of puni&s;hment that Mr. Burke builds a great part of his tragic &s;cene. Let us therefore examine how men came by the idea of puni&s;hing in this manner.</P>
<P>They learn it from the governments they live under, and retaliate the puni&s;hments they have been accu&s;tomed to behold. The heads &s;tuck upon &s;pikes, which remained for years upon Temple-bar, differed nothing in the horror of the &s;cene from tho&s;e carried about upon &s;pikes at Paris: yet this was done by the Engli&s;h go|vernment.

It may perhaps be &s;aid, that it &s;igni|fies nothing to a man what is done to him after he is dead; but it &s;ignifies much to the living: it either tortures their feelings, or hardens their hearts; and in either ca&s;e, it in&s;tructs them how to puni&s;h when power falls into their hands.</P>
<P>Lay then the axe to the root, and teach govern|ments humanity. It is their &s;anguinary puni&s;h|ments which corrupt mankind. In England, the puni&s;hment in certain ca&s;es, is by <HI>hanging, draw|ing,</HI> and <HI>quartering;</HI> the heart of the &s;ufferer is cut out, and held up to the view of the populace. In France, under the former goverment, the pu|ni&s;hments were not le&s;s barbarous. Who does not remember the execution of Damien, torn to pieces by hor&s;es? The effect of tho&s;e cruel &s;pecta|cles exhibited to the populace, is to de&s;troy ten|derne&s;s, or excite revenge; and by the ba&s;e and fal&s;e idea of governing men by terror, in&s;tead of rea&s;on, they become precedents. It is over the lowe&s;t cla&s;s of mankind that government by terror is intended to operate, and it is on them that it operates to the wor&s;t effect.

<P>There is in all European countries, a large cla&s;s of people of that de&s;cription which in Eng|land is called the <HI>"mob."</HI> Of this cla&s;s were tho&s;e who committed the burnings and deva&s;ta|tions in London in 1780, and of this cla&s;s were tho&s;e who carried the heads upon &s;pikes in Paris.

Foulon and Berthier were taken up in the coun|try, and &s;ent to Paris, to undergo their examina|tion at the Hotel de Ville; for the National A&s;|&s;embly, immediately on the new mini&s;try coming into office, pa&s;&s;ed a decree, which they commu|nicated to the King and Cabinet, that they (the National A&s;&s;embly) would hold the mini&s;try, of which Foulon was one, re&s;pon&s;ible for the mea|&s;ures they were advi&s;ing and pur&s;uing; but the mob, incen&s;ed at the appearance of Foulon and Berthier, tore them from their conductors before they were carried to the Hotel de Ville, and exe|cuted them on the &s;pot. Why then does Mr. Burke charge outrages of this kind on a whole people? As well may he charge the riots and outrages of 1780 on all the people of London, or tho&s;e in Ireland on all his countrymen.</P>
<P>But every thing we &s;ee or hear offen&s;ive to our feelings, and derogatory to the human character, &s;hould lead to other reflections than tho&s;e of re|proach. Even the beings who commit them have &s;ome claim to our con&s;ideration. How then is it that &s;uch va&s;t cla&s;&s;es of mankind as are di&s;|tingui&s;hed by the appellation of the vulgar, or the ignorant mob, are &s;o numerous in all old countries? The in&s;tant we a&s;k our&s;elves this que&s;tion, reflection feels an an&s;wer. They ari&s;e, as an unavoidable con&s;equence, out of the ill con&s;truction of all old governments in Europe, England included with the re&s;t. It is by di&s;torted|ly exalting &s;ome men, that others are di&s;tortedly deba&s;ed, till the whole is out of nature. A va&s;t
<PB N="38" REF="40">
ma&s;s of mankind are degradedly thrown into the back-ground of the human picture, to bring for|ward with greater glare, the puppet-&s;how of &s;tate and ari&s;tocracy. In the commencement of a Revolution, tho&s;e men are rather the followers of the <HI>camp</HI> than of the <HI>&s;tandard</HI> of liberty, and have yet to be in&s;tructed how to reverence it.</P>
<P>I give to Mr. Burke all his theatrical exagge|rations for facts, and I then a&s;k him, if they do not e&s;tabli&s;h the certainty of what I here lay down? Admitting them to be true, they &s;hew the nece&s;&s;i|ty of the French Revolution, as much as any one thing he could have a&s;&s;erted. The&s;e outrages were not the effect of the principles of the Revolution, but of the degraded mind that exi&s;ted before the Revolution, and which the Revolution is calculated to reform. Place them then to their proper cau&s;e, and take the reproach of them to your own &s;ide.</P>
<P>It is to the honour of the National A&s;&s;embly, and the city of Paris, that during &s;uch a tremen|dous &s;cene of arms and confu&s;ion, beyond the controul of all authority, they have been able, by the influence of example and exhortation, to re&s;train &s;o much. Never were more pains taken to in&s;truct and enlighten mankind, and to make them &s;ee that their intere&s;t con&s;i&s;ted in their virtue, and not in their revenge, than have been di&s;played in the Revolution of France. I now proceed to make &s;ome remarks on Mr. Burke's account of the expedition to Ver&s;ailles, October the 5th and 6th.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="41">I cannot con&s;ider Mr. Burke's book in &s;carcely any other light than a dramatic performance; and he mu&s;t, I think, have con&s;idered it in the &s;ame light him&s;elf, by the poetical liberties he has taken of omitting &s;ome facts, di&s;torting others, and making the whole machinery bend to pro|duce a &s;tage effect. Of this kind is his account of the expedition to Ver&s;ailles. He begins this account by omitting the only facts which as cau&s;es are known to be true; every thing beyond the&s;e is conjecture even in Paris: and he then works up a tale accommodated to his own pa&s;&s;ions and prejudices.</P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erved throughout Mr. Burke's book, that he never &s;peaks of plots <HI>again&s;t</HI> the Revolution; and it is from tho&s;e plots that all the mi&s;chiefs have ari&s;en. It &s;uits his purpo&s;e to exhibit the con&s;equences without their cau&s;es. It is one of the arts of the drama to do &s;o. If the crimes of men were exhibited with their &s;ufferings, &s;tage effect would &s;ometimes be lo&s;t, and the audience would be inclined to ap|prove where it was intended they &s;hould commi|&s;erate.</P>
<P>After all the inve&s;tigations that have been made into this intricate affair, (the expedition to Ver|&s;ailles), it &s;till remains enveloped in all that kind of my&s;tery which ever accompanies events produ|ced more from a concurrence of awkward circum|&s;tances, than from fixed de&s;ign. While the cha|racters of men are forming, as is always the ca&s;e in revolutions, there is a reciprocal &s;u&s;picion, and
<PB N="40" REF="42">
a di&s;po&s;ition to mi&s;interpret each other; and even parties directly oppo&s;ite in principle, will &s;ome|times concur in pu&s;hing forward the &s;ame move|ment with very different views, and with the hopes of its producing very different con&s;equences. A great deal of this may be di&s;covered in this em|barra&s;&s;ed affair, and yet the i&s;&s;ue of the whole was what nobody had in view.</P>
<P>The only things certainly known, are, that con|&s;iderable unea&s;ine&s;s was at this time excited at Paris, by the delay of the King in not &s;anctioning and forwarding the decrees of the National A&s;&s;em|bly, particularly that of the <HI>Declaration of the Rights of Man,</HI> and the decrees of the <HI>fourth of Augu&s;t,</HI> which contained the foundation principles on which the con&s;titution was to be erected. The kinde&s;t, and perhaps the faire&s;t conjecture upon this matter is, that &s;ome of the mini&s;ters intended to make remarks and ob&s;ervations upon certain parts of them, before they were finally &s;anctioned and &s;ent to the provinces; but be this as it may, the enemies of the revolution derived hope from the delay, and the friends of the revolution, un|ea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>During this &s;tate of &s;u&s;pen&s;e, the <HI>Garde du Corps,</HI> which was compo&s;ed, as &s;uch regiments generally are, of per&s;ons much connected with the Court, gave an entertainment at Ver&s;ailles (Oct. 1,) to &s;ome foreign regiments then arrived; and when the entertainment was at the height, on a &s;ignal given, the <HI>Garde du Corps</HI> tore the national cockade from their hats, trampled it under foot, and re|placed
<PB N="41" REF="43">
it with a counter cockade prepared for the purpo&s;e. An indignity of this kind amounted to defiance. It was like declaring war; and if men will give challenges, they mu&s;t expect con&s;equen+ces. But all this Mr. Burke has carefully kept out of &s;ight. He begins his account by &s;aying, <Q>Hi&s;tory will record, that on the morning of the 6th of October 1789, the King and Queen of France, after a day of confu&s;ion, alarm, di&s;may, and &s;laughter, lay down under the pledged &s;ecu|rity of public faith, to indulge nature in a few hours of re&s;pite, and troubled melancholy re|po&s;e.</Q> This is neither the &s;ober &s;tile of hi&s;|tory, nor the intention of it. It leaves every thing to be gue&s;&s;ed at, and mi&s;taken. One would at lea&s;t think there had been a battle; and a battle there probably would have been, had it not been for the moderating prudence of tho&s;e whom Mr. Burke involves in his cen&s;ures. By his keeping the <HI>Garde du Corps</HI> out of &s;ight, Mr. Burke has afforded him&s;elf the dramatic licence of putting the King and Queen in their places, as if the ob|ject of the expedition was again&s;t them.&mdash;But, to return to my account&mdash;</P>
<P>This conduct of the <HI>Garde du Corps,</HI> as might well be expected, alarmed and enraged the Pari|&s;ians. The colours of the cau&s;e, and the cau&s;e it&s;elf, were become too united to mi&s;take the in|tention of the in&s;ult, and the Pari&s;ians were deter|mined to call the <HI>Garde du Corps</HI> to an account. There was certainly nothing of the cowardice of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination in marching in the face of day to de|mand
<PB N="42" REF="44">
&s;atisfaction, if &s;uch a phra&s;e may be u&s;ed, of a body of armed men who had voluntarily given defiance. But the circum&s;tance which &s;erves to throw this affair into embarra&s;&s;ment is, that the enemies of the revolution appear to have encoura|ged it, as well as its friends. The one hoped to prevent a civil war by checking it in time, and the other to make one. The hopes of tho&s;e oppo&s;ed to the revolution, re&s;ted in making the King of their party, and getting him from Ver&s;ailles to Metz, where they expected to collect a force, and &s;et up a &s;tandard. We have therefore two different ob|jects pre&s;enting them&s;elves at the &s;ame time, and to be accompli&s;hed by the &s;ame means: the one, to cha&s;ti&s;e the <HI>Garde du Corps,</HI> which was the object of the Pari&s;ians; the other, to render the confu|&s;ion of &s;uch a &s;cene an inducement to the King to &s;et off for Metz.</P>
<P>On the 5th of October, a very numerous body of women, and men in the di&s;gui&s;e of women, collected round the Hotel de Ville or town-hall at Paris, and &s;et off for Ver&s;ailles. Their profe&s;&s;ed object was the <HI>Garde du Corps;</HI> but prudent men readily recollect that mi&s;chief is more ea&s;ily begun than ended; and this impre&s;&s;ed it&s;elf with the more force, from the &s;u&s;picions already &s;tated, and the irregularity of &s;uch a cavalcade. As &s;oon there|fore as a &s;ufficient force could be collected, M. de la Fayette, by orders from the civil authority of Paris, &s;et off after them at the head of twenty thou&s;and of the Paris militia. The revolution could derive no benefit from confu&s;ion, and its
<PB N="43" REF="45">
oppo&s;ers might. By an amiable and &s;pirited man|ner of addre&s;s, he had hitherto been fortunate in calming di&s;quietudes, and in this he was extraor|dinarily &s;ucce&s;sful; to fru&s;trate, therefore, the hopes of tho&s;e who might &s;eek to improve this &s;cene into a &s;ort of ju&s;tifiable nece&s;&s;ity for the King's quitting Ver&s;ailles and withdrawing to Metz, and to pre|vent at the &s;ame time the con&s;equences that might en&s;ue between the <HI>Garde du Corps</HI> and this phalanx of men and women, he forwarded expre&s;&s;es to the King, that he was on his march to Ver&s;ailles, by the orders of the civil authority of Paris, for the purpo&s;e of peace and protection, expre&s;&s;ing at the &s;ame time the nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;training the <HI>Garde du Corps</HI> from firing upon the people<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am warranted in a&s;&s;erting this, as I had it per&s;onally from M. de la Fayette, with whom I have lived in habits of friend&s;hip for fourteen years.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>He arrived at Ver&s;ailles between ten and eleven at night. The <HI>Garde du Corps</HI> was drawn up, and the people had arrived &s;ome time before, but every thing had remained &s;u&s;pended. Wi&s;dom and policy now con&s;i&s;ted in changing a &s;cene of danger into a happy event. M. de la Fayette became the mediator between the enraged parties; and the King, to remove the unea&s;ine&s;s which had ari&s;en from the delay already &s;tated, &s;ent for the Pre&s;ident of the National A&s;&s;embly, and &s;igned the <HI>Declaration of the Rights of Man,</HI> and &s;uch other parts of the con&s;titution as were in readine&s;s.</P>
<P>It was now about one in the morning. Every thing appeared to be compo&s;ed, and a general
<PB N="44" REF="46">
congratulation took place. By the beat of drum a proclamation was made, that the citizens of Ver&s;ailles would give the ho&s;pitality of their hou&s;es to their fellow-citizens of Paris. Tho&s;e who could not be accommodated in this manner, remained in the &s;treets, or took up their quarters in the churches; and at two o'clock the King and Queen retired.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate matters pa&s;&s;ed till the break of day, when a fre&s;h di&s;turbance aro&s;e from the cen&s;urable conduct of &s;ome of both parties, for &s;uch charac|ters there will be in all &s;uch &s;cenes. One of the <HI>Garde du Corps</HI> appeared at one of the windows of the palace, and the people who had remained during the night in the &s;treets acco&s;ted him with reviling and provocative language. In&s;tead of retiring, as in &s;uch a ca&s;e prudence would have dictated, he pre&s;ented his mu&s;ket, fired, and kil|led one of the Paris militia. The peace being thus broken, the people ru&s;hed into the palace in que&s;t of the offender. They attacked the quar|ters of the <HI>Garde du Corps</HI> within the palace, and pur&s;ued them throughout the avenues of it, and to the apartments of the King. On this tumult, not the Queen only, as Mr. Burke has repre&s;ented it, but every per&s;on in the palace, was awakened and alarmed; and M. de la Fayette had a &s;econd time to interpo&s;e between the parties, the event of which was, that the <HI>Garde du Corps</HI> put on the national cockade, and the matter ended as by oblivion, after the lo&s;s of two or three lives.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="47">During the latter part of the time in which this confu&s;ion was acting, the King and Queen were in public at the balcony, and neither of them concealed for &s;afety's &s;ake, as Mr. Burke in|&s;inuates. Matters being thus appea&s;ed, and tran|quillity re&s;tored, a general acclamation broke forth, of <HI>Le Roi &agrave; Paris&mdash;Le Roi &agrave; Paris</HI>&mdash;The King to Paris. It was the &s;hout of peace, and immediately accepted on the part of the King. By this mea|&s;ure, all future projects of trapanning the King to Metz, and &s;etting up the &s;tandard of oppo&s;ition to the con&s;titution, were prevented, and the &s;u&s;pi|cions extingui&s;hed. The King and his family reached Paris in the evening, and were congra|tulated on their arrival by Mr. Bailley the Mayor of Paris, in the name of the citizens. Mr. Burke, who throughout his book confounds things, per|&s;ons, and principles, has in his remarks on M. Bailley's addre&s;s, confounded time al&s;o. He cen|&s;ures M. Bailley for calling it, <HI>"un bon jour,"</HI> a good day. Mr. Burke &s;hould have informed him|&s;elf, that this &s;cene took up the &s;pace of two days, the day on which it began with every appearance of danger and mi&s;chief, and the day on which it terminated without the mi&s;chiefs that threatened; and that it is to this peaceful termination that M. Bailley alludes, and to the arrival of the King at Paris. Not le&s;s than three hundred thou&s;and per&s;ons arranged them&s;elves in the proce&s;&s;ion from Ver&s;ailles to Paris, and not an act of mole&s;tation was committed during the whole march.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="48">Mr. Burke, on the authority of M. Lally Tol|lendal, a de&s;erter from the National A&s;&s;embly, &s;ays, that on entering Paris, the people &s;houted, <HI>"Tous les eveques &agrave; la lanterne."</HI> All Bi&s;hops to be hanged at the lanthorn or lamp-po&s;ts.&mdash;It is &s;ur|pri&s;ing that nobody could hear this but Lally Tollendal, and that nobody &s;hould believe it but Mr. Burke. It has not the lea&s;t connection with any part of the tran&s;action, and is totally foreign to every circum&s;tance of it. The bi&s;hops had never been introduced before into any &s;cene of Mr. Burke's drama; Why then are they, all at once, and altogether, <HI>tout &agrave; coup et tous en&s;emble,</HI> introduced now? Mr. Burke brings forward his bi&s;hops and his lanthorn like figures in a magic lanthorn, and rai&s;es his &s;cenes by contra&s;t in&s;tead of connection. But it &s;erves to &s;hew, with the re&s;t of his book, what little credit ought to be given, where even probability is &s;et at defiance, for the purpo&s;e of defaming; and with this reflec|tion, in&s;tead of a &s;oliloquy in prai&s;e of chivalry, as Mr. Burke has done, I clo&s;e the account of the expedition to Ver&s;ailles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An account of the expedition to Ver&s;ailles may be &s;een in No. 13. of the <HI>Revolution de Paris,</HI> containing the events from the 3d to the 10th of October 1789.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I have now to follow Mr. Burke through a path|le&s;s wilderne&s;s of rhap&s;odies, and a &s;ort of de&s;cant upon governments, in which he a&s;&s;erts whatever he plea&s;es, on the pre&s;umption of its being be|lieved,
<PB N="47" REF="49">
without offering either evidence or rea|&s;ons for &s;o doing.</P>
<P>Before any thing can be rea&s;oned upon to a conclu&s;ion, certain facts, principles, or data, to rea&s;on from, mu&s;t be e&s;tabli&s;hed, admitted, or de|nied. Mr. Burke, with his u&s;ual outrage, abu&s;es the <HI>Declaration of the Rights of Man,</HI> publi&s;hed by the National A&s;&s;embly of France as the ba&s;is on which the con&s;titution of France is built. This he calls "paltry and blurred &s;heets of paper about the rights of man."&mdash;Does Mr. Burke mean to deny that <HI>man</HI> has any rights? If he does, then he mu&s;t mean that there are no &s;uch things as rights any where, and that he has none him&s;elf; for who is there in the world but man? But if Mr. Burke means to admit that man has rights, the que&s;tion then will be, What are tho&s;e rights, and how came man by them originally?</P>
<P>The error of tho&s;e who rea&s;on by precedents drawn from antiquity, re&s;pecting the rights of man, is, that they do not go far enough into an|tiquity. They do not go the whole way. They &s;top in &s;ome of the intermediate &s;tages of an hundred or a thou&s;and years, and produce what was then done, as a rule for the pre&s;ent day. This is no au|thority at all. If we travel &s;till farther into anti|quity, we &s;hall find a direct contrary opinion and practice prevailing; and if antiquity is to be au|thority, a thou&s;and &s;uch authorities may be pro|duced, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively contradicting each other: But if we proceed on, we &s;hall at la&s;t come out right; we &s;hall come to the time when man came from
<PB N="48" REF="50">
the hand of his Maker. What was he then? Man. Man was his high and only title, and a higher cannot be given him.&mdash;But of titles I &s;hall &s;peak hereafter.</P>
<P>We are now got at the origin of man, and at the origin of his rights. As to the manner in which the world has been governed from that day to this, it is no farther any concern of ours than to make a proper u&s;e of the errors or the improve|ments which the hi&s;tory of it pre&s;ents. Tho&s;e who lived a hundred or a thou&s;and years ago, were then moderns, as we are now. They had <HI>their</HI> ancients, and tho&s;e ancients had others, and we al&s;o &s;hall be ancients in our turn. If the mere name of anti|quity is to govern in the affairs of life, the people who are to live an hundred or a thou&s;and years hence, may as well take us for a precedent, as we make a precedent of tho&s;e who lived an hundred or a thou&s;and years ago. The fact is, that por|tions of antiquity, by proving every thing, e&s;tabli&s;h nothing. It is authority again&s;t authority all the way, till we come to the divine origin of the rights of man at the creation. Here our enquiries find a re&s;ting-place, and our rea&s;on finds a home. If a di&s;pute about the rights of man had ari&s;en at the di&s;tance of an hundred years from the creation, it is to this &s;ource of authority they mu&s;t have re|ferred, and it is to the &s;ame &s;ource of authority that we mu&s;t now refer.</P>
<P>Though I mean not to touch upon any &s;ectarian principle of religion, yet it may be worth ob&s;erv|ing, that the genealogy of Chri&s;t is traced to Adam.
<PB N="49" REF="51">
Why then not trace the rights of man to the crea|tion of man? I will an&s;wer the que&s;tion. Be|cau&s;e there have been up&s;tart governments thru&s;ting them&s;elves between, and pre&s;umptuou&s;ly working to <HI>un-make</HI> man.</P>
<P>If any generation of men ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the right of dictating the mode by which the world &s;hould be governed for ever, it was the fir&s;t generation that exi&s;ted; and if that generation did it not, no &s;ucceeding generation can &s;hew any authority for doing it, nor can &s;et any up. The illuminating and divine principle of the equal rights of man, (for it has its origin from the Maker of man) re|lates, not only to the living individuals, but to ge|nerations of men &s;ucceeding each other. Every generation is equal in rights to the generations which preceded it, by the &s;ame rule that every individual is born equal in rights with his contem|porary.</P>
<P>Every hi&s;tory of the creation, and every tradi|tionary account, whether from the lettered or un|lettered world, however they may vary in their opinion or belief of certain particulars, all agree in e&s;tabli&s;hing one point, <HI>the unity of man;</HI> by which I mean, that men are all of <HI>one degree,</HI> and con&s;equently that all men are born equal, and with equal natural right, in the &s;ame manner as if po|&s;terity had been continued by <HI>creation</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>generation,</HI> the latter being only the mode by which the former is carried forward; and con&s;equently, every child born into the world mu&s;t be con&s;idered as deriving its exi&s;tence from God. The world is
<PB N="50" REF="52">
as new to him as it was to the fir&s;t man that ex|i&s;ted, and his natural right in it is of the &s;ame kind.</P>
<P>The Mo&s;aic account of the creation, whether taken as divine authority, or merely hi&s;torical, is full to this point, <HI>the unity or equality of man.</HI> The expre&s;&s;ions admit of no controver&s;y. <Q>And God &s;aid, Let us make man in our own image. In the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.</Q> The di&s;tinction of &s;exes is pointed out, but no other di&s;tinction is even implied If this be not divine authority, it is at lea&s;t hi&s;torical authority, and &s;hews that the equality of man, &s;o far from being a modern doc|trine, is the olde&s;t upon record.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o to be ob&s;erved, that all the religions known in the world are founded, &s;o far as they relate to man, on the <HI>unity of man,</HI> as being all of one degree. Whether in heaven or in hell, or in whatever &s;tate man may be &s;uppo&s;ed to exi&s;t here|after, the good and the bad are the only di&s;tinc|tions. Nay, even the laws of governments are obliged to &s;lide into this principle, by making de|grees to con&s;i&s;t in crimes, and not in per&s;ons.</P>
<P>It is one of the greate&s;t of all truths, and of the highe&s;t advantage to cultivate. By con&s;idering man in this light, and by in&s;tructing him to con&s;i|der him&s;elf in this light, it places him in a clo&s;e connection with all his duties, whether to his Cre|ator, or to the creation, of which he is a part; and it is only when he forgets his origin, or, to u&s;e a more fa&s;hionable phra&s;e, his <HI>birth and family,</HI> that
<PB N="51" REF="53">
he becomes di&s;&s;olute. It is not among the lea&s;t of the evils of the pre&s;ent exi&s;ting governments in all parts of Europe, that man, con&s;idered as man, is thrown back to a va&s;t di&s;tance from his Maker, and the artificial cha&s;m filled up by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of barriers, or &s;ort of turnpike gates, through which he has to pa&s;s. I will quote Mr. Burke's catalogue of barriers that he has &s;et up between man and his Maker. Putting him&s;elf in the character of a he|rald, he &s;ays&mdash;<Q>We fear God&mdash;we look with <HI>awe</HI> to kings&mdash;with affection to parliaments&mdash;with duty to magi&s;trates&mdash;with reverence to prie&s;ts, and with re&s;pect to nobility.</Q> Mr. Burke has forgotten to put in <HI>"chivalry."</HI> He has al&s;o for|gotten to put in Peter.</P>
<P>The duty of man is not a wilderne&s;s of turnpike gates, through which he is to pa&s;s by tickets from one to the other. It is plain and &s;imple, and con|&s;i&s;ts but of two points. His duty to God, which every man mu&s;t feel; and with re&s;pect to his neighbour, to do as he would be done by. If tho&s;e to whom power is delegated do well, they will be re&s;pected; if not, they will be de&s;pi&s;ed: and with regard to tho&s;e to whom no power is de|legated, but who a&s;&s;ume it, the rational world can know nothing of them.</P>
<P>Hitherto we have &s;poken only (and that but in part) of the natural rights of man. We have now to con&s;ider the civil rights of man, and to &s;hew how the one originates from the other. Man did not enter into &s;ociety to become <HI>wor&s;e</HI> than he was before, nor to have fewer rights than he had
<PB N="52" REF="54">
before, but to have tho&s;e rights better &s;ecured. His natural rights are the foundation of all his civil rights. But in order to pur&s;ue this di&s;tinction with more preci&s;ion, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to mark the different qualities of natural and civil rights.</P>
<P>A few words will explain this. Natural rights are tho&s;e which appertain to man in right of his exi&s;tence. Of this kind are all the intellectual rights, or rights of the mind, and al&s;o all tho&s;e rights of acting as an individual for his own com|fort and happine&s;s, which are not injurious to the natural rights of others.&mdash;Civil rights are tho&s;e which appertain to man in right of his being a member of &s;ociety. Every civil right has for its foundation, &s;ome natural right pre-exi&s;ting in the individual, but to the enjoyment of which his individual power is not, in all ca&s;es, &s;ufficiently competent. Of this kind are all tho&s;e which relate to &s;ecurity and protection.</P>
<P>From this &s;hort review, it will be ea&s;y to di&s;tin|gui&s;h between that cla&s;s of natural rights which man retains after entering into &s;ociety, and tho&s;e which he throws into the common &s;tock as a mem|ber of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The natural rights which he retains, are all tho&s;e in which the <HI>power</HI> to execute is as perfect in the individual as the right it&s;elf. Among this cla&s;s, as is before mentioned, are all the intellectual rights, or rights of the mind: con&s;equently, re|ligion is one of tho&s;e rights. The natural rights which are not retained, are all tho&s;e in which, though the right is perfect in the individual, the
<PB N="53" REF="55">
power to execute them is defective. They an|&s;wer not his purpo&s;e. A man, by natural right, has a right to judge in his own cau&s;e; and &s;o far as the right of the mind is concerned, he never &s;urrenders it: But what availeth it him to judge, if he has not power to redre&s;s? He therefore de|po&s;its this right in the common &s;tock of &s;ociety, and takes the arm of &s;ociety, of which he is a part, in preference and in addition to his own. Society <HI>grants</HI> him nothing. Every man is a proprietor in &s;ociety, and draws on the capital as a matter of right.</P>
<P>From the&s;e premi&s;es, two or three certain con|clu&s;ions will follow.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That every civil right grows out of a na|tural right; or, in other words, is a natural right exchanged.</P>
<P>Secondly, That civil power, properly con&s;idered as &s;uch, is made up of the aggregate of that cla&s;s of the natural rights of man, which becomes de|fective in the individual in point of power, and an|&s;wers not his purpo&s;e; but when collected to a focus, becomes competent to the purpo&s;e of every one.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That the power produced from the ag|gregate of natural rights, imperfect in power in the individual, cannot be applied to invade the natu|ral rights which are retained in the individual, and in which the power to execute is as per|fect as the right it&s;elf.</P>
<P>We have now, in a few words, traced man from a natural individual to a member of &s;ociety, and &s;hewn, or endeavoured to &s;hew, the quality of the
<PB N="54" REF="56">
natural rights retained, and of tho&s;e which are ex|changed for civil rights. Let us now apply the&s;e principles to governments.</P>
<P>In ca&s;ting our eyes over the world, it is ex|tremely ea&s;y to di&s;tingui&s;h the governments which have ari&s;en out of &s;ociety, or out of the &s;ocial com|pact, from tho&s;e which have not: but to place this in a clearer light than what a &s;ingle glance may afford, it will be proper to take a review of the &s;everal &s;ources from which governments have a|ri&s;en, and on which they have been founded.</P>
<P>They may be all comprehended under three heads. Fir&s;t, Super&s;tition. Secondly, Power. Thirdly, The common intere&s;t of &s;ociety, and the common rights of man.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t was a government of prie&s;tcraft, the &s;econd of conquerors, and the third of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>When a &s;et of artful men pretended, through the medium of oracles, to hold intercour&s;e with the Deity, as familiarly as they now march up the back|&s;tairs in European courts, the world was completely under the government of &s;uper&s;tition. The oracles were con&s;ulted, and whatever they were made to &s;ay, became the law; and this &s;ort of government la&s;ted as long as this &s;ort of &s;uper&s;tition la&s;ted.</P>
<P>After the&s;e a race of conquerors aro&s;e, who&s;e government, like that of William the Conqueror, was founded in power, and the &s;word a&s;&s;umed the name of a &s;cepter. Governments thus e&s;tabli&s;hed, la&s;t as long as the power to &s;upport them la&s;ts; but that they might avail them&s;elves of every engine in their favour, they united fraud to force,
<PB N="55" REF="57">
and &s;et up an idol which they called <HI>Divine Right,</HI> and which, in imitation of the Pope, who affects to be &s;piritual and temporal, and in contradiction to the Founder of the Chri&s;tian religion, twi&s;ted it&s;elf afterwards into an idol of another &s;hape, called <HI>Church and State.</HI> The key of St. Peter, and the key of the Trea&s;ury, became quartered on one another, and the wondering cheated multitude wor&s;hipped the invention.</P>
<P>When I contemplate the natural dignity of man; when I feel (for Nature has not been kind enough to me to blunt my feelings) for the honour and happine&s;s of its character, I become irritated at the attempt to govern mankind by force and fraud, as if they were all knaves and fools, and can &s;carcely avoid di&s;gu&s;t at tho&s;e who are thus impo&s;ed upon.</P>
<P>We have now to review the governments which ari&s;e out of &s;ociety, in contradi&s;tinction to tho&s;e which aro&s;e out of &s;uper&s;tition and conque&s;t.</P>
<P>It has been thought a con&s;iderable advance to|wards e&s;tabli&s;hing the principles of Freedom, to &s;ay, that government is a compact between tho&s;e who govern and tho&s;e who are governed: but this can|not be true, becau&s;e it is putting the effect before the cau&s;e; for as man mu&s;t have exi&s;ted before governments exi&s;ted, there nece&s;&s;arily was a time when governments did not exi&s;t, and con&s;equently there could originally exi&s;t no governors to form &s;uch a compact with. The fact therefore mu&s;t be, that the <HI>individuals them&s;elves,</HI> each in his own per&s;onal and &s;overeign right, <HI>entered into a compact with each other</HI> to produce a government: and this
<PB N="56" REF="58">
is the only mode in which governments have a right to ari&s;e, and the only principle on which they have a right to exi&s;t.</P>
<P>To po&s;&s;e&s;s our&s;elves of a clear idea of what go|vernment is, or ought to be, we mu&s;t trace it to its origin. In doing this, we &s;hall ea&s;ily di&s;cover that governments mu&s;t have ari&s;en, either <HI>out</HI> of the people, or <HI>over</HI> the people. Mr. Burke has made no di&s;tinction. He inve&s;tigates nothing to its &s;ource, and therefore he confounds every thing: but he has &s;ignified his intention of undertaking at &s;ome future opportunity, a compari&s;on between the con&s;titutions of England and France. As he thus renders it a &s;ubject of controver&s;y by throwing the gauntlet, I take him up on his own ground. It is in high challenges that high truths have the right of appearing; and I accept it with the more readine&s;s, becau&s;e it affords me, at the &s;ame time, an opportunity of pur&s;uing the &s;ubject with re&s;pect to governments ari&s;ing out of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>But it will be fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to define what is meant by a <HI>con&s;titution.</HI> It is not &s;ufficient that we adopt the word; we mu&s;t fix al&s;o a &s;tandard &s;igni|fication to it.</P>
<P>A con&s;titution is not a thing in name only, but in fact. It has not an ideal, but a real exi&s;tence; and wherever it cannot be produced in a vi&s;ible form, there is none. A con&s;titution is a thing <HI>an|tecedent</HI> to a government, and a government is only the creature of a con&s;titution. The con&s;titution of a country is not the act of its government, but of the people con&s;tituting a government. It is the
<PB N="57" REF="59">
body of elements, to which you can refer, and quote article by article; and which contains the principles on which the government &s;hall be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, the manner in which it &s;hall be organized, the powers it &s;hall have, the mode of elections, the duration of parliaments, or by what other name &s;uch bodies may be called; the powers which the executive part of the government &s;hall have; and, in fine, every thing that relates to the compleat or|ganization of a civil government, and the principles on which it &s;hall act, and by which it &s;hall be bound. A con&s;titution, therefore, is to a govern|ment, what the laws made afterwards by that go|vernment are to a court of judicature. The court of judicature does not make the laws, neither can it alter them; it only acts in conformity to the laws made: and the government is in like manner go|verned by the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Can then Mr. Burke produce the Engli&s;h Con|&s;titution? If he cannot, we may fairly conclude, that though it has been &s;o much talked about, no &s;uch thing as a con&s;titution exi&s;ts, or ever did exi&s;t, and con&s;equently that the people have yet a con&s;titution to form.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke will not, I pre&s;ume, deny the po&s;ition I have already advanced; namely, that govern|ments ari&s;e, either <HI>out</HI> of the people, or <HI>over</HI> the people. The Engli&s;h government is one of tho&s;e which aro&s;e out of a conque&s;t, and not out of &s;ociety, and con&s;equently it aro&s;e over the people; and though it has been much modified from the opportunity of circum&s;tances &s;ince the time of
<PB N="58" REF="60">
William the Conqueror, the country has never yet regenerated it&s;elf, and is therefore without a con&s;titution.</P>
<P>I readily perceive the rea&s;on why Mr. Burke declined going into the compari&s;on between the Engli&s;h and French con&s;titutions, becau&s;e he could not but perceive, when he &s;at down to the ta&s;k, that no &s;uch thing as a con&s;titution exi&s;ted on his &s;ide the que&s;tion. His book is certainly bulky enough to have contained all he could &s;ay on this &s;ubject, and it would have been the be&s;t manner in which people could have judged of their &s;eparate merits. Why then has he declined the only thing that was worth while to write upon? It was the &s;tronge&s;t ground he could take, if the advantages were on his &s;ide; but the weake&s;t, if they were not: and his declining to take it, is either a &s;ign that he could not po&s;&s;e&s;s it, or could not maintain it.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke &s;aid in a &s;peech la&s;t winter in parliament, That when the National A&s;&s;embly fir&s;t met in three Orders, (the Tiers Etats, the Clergy, and the Noble&s;&s;e), France had then a good con&s;titution. This &s;hews, among nume|rous other in&s;tances, that Mr. Burke does not under&s;tand what a con&s;titution is. The per&s;ons &s;o met, were not a <HI>con&s;titution,</HI> but a <HI>convention,</HI> to make a con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent National A&s;&s;embly of France is, &s;trictly &s;peaking, the per&s;onal &s;ocial compact.&mdash; The members of it are the delegates of the na|tion in its <HI>original</HI> character; future a&s;&s;emblies will be the delegates of the nation in its <HI>organized</HI>
<PB N="59" REF="61">
character. The authority of the pre&s;ent A&s;&s;embly is different to what the authority of future A&s;&s;em|blies will be. The authority of the pre&s;ent one is to form a con&s;titution: the authority of future A&s;&s;emblies will be to legi&s;late according to the principles and forms pre&s;cribed in that con&s;titu|tion; and if experience &s;hould hereafter &s;hew that alterations, amendments, or additions, are nece&s;|&s;ary, the con&s;titution will point out the mode by which &s;uch things &s;hall be done, and not leave it to the di&s;cretionary power of the future govern|ment.</P>
<P>A government on the principles on which con|&s;titutional governments ari&s;ing out of &s;ociety are e&s;tabli&s;hed, cannot have the right of altering it&s;elf. If it had, it would be arbitrary. It might make it&s;elf what it plea&s;ed; and wherever &s;uch a right is &s;et up, it &s;hews there is no con&s;titution. The act by which the Engli&s;h Parliament empowered it&s;elf to &s;it &s;even years, &s;hews there is no con&s;titu|tion in England. It might, by the &s;ame &s;elf-authority, have &s;at any greater number of years, or for life. The Bill which the pre&s;ent Mr. Pitt brought into parliament &s;ome years ago, to reform parliament, was on the &s;ame erroneous principle. The right of reform is in the nation in its original character, and the con&s;titutional method would be by a general convention elected for the purpo&s;e. There is, moreover, a paradox in the idea of vitia|ted bodies reforming them&s;elves.</P>
<P>From the&s;e preliminaries I proceed to draw &s;ome compari&s;ons. I have already &s;poken of the
<PB N="60" REF="62">
declaration of rights; and as I mean to be as con|ci&s;e as po&s;&s;ible, I &s;hall proceed to other parts of the French con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The con&s;titution of France &s;ays, That every man who pays a tax of &s;ixty &s;ous <HI>per annum,</HI> (2s. and 6d. Engli&s;h), is an elector.&mdash;What article will Mr. Burke place again&s;t this? Can any thing be more limited, and at the &s;ame time more capri|cious, than the qualifications of electors are in England? Limited&mdash;becau&s;e not one man in an hundred (I &s;peak much within compa&s;s) is admit|ted to vote: Capricious&mdash;becau&s;e the lowe&s;t cha|racter that can be &s;uppo&s;ed to exi&s;t, and who has not &s;o much as the vi&s;ible means of an hone&s;t live|lihood, is an elector in &s;ome places; while, in other places, the man who pays very large taxes, and has a known fair character, and the farmer who rents to the amount of three or four hundred pounds a year, with a property on that farm to three or four times that amount, is not admit|ted to be an elector. Every thing is out of nature, as Mr. Burke &s;ays on another occa&s;ion, in this &s;trange chaos, and all &s;orts of follies are blended with all &s;orts of crimes. William the Conqueror and his de&s;cendants parcelled out the country in this manner, and bribed &s;ome parts of it by what they called Charters, to hold the other parts of it the better &s;ubjected to their will. This is the rea&s;on why &s;o many of tho&s;e charters abound in Cornwall; the people were aver&s;e to the government e&s;ta|bli&s;hed at the Conque&s;t, and the towns were garri|&s;oned and bribed to en&s;lave the country. All the
<PB N="61" REF="63">
old charters are the badges of this conque&s;t, and it is from this &s;ource that the capriciou&s;ne&s;s of elections ari&s;es.</P>
<P>The French con&s;titution &s;ays, That the number of repre&s;entatives for any place &s;hall be in a ratio to the number of taxable inhabitants or electors. What article will Mr. Burke place again&s;t this? The county of York&s;hire, which contains near a million of &s;ouls, &s;ends two county members; and &s;o does the county of Rutland, which contains not an hundredth part of that number. The town of old Sarum, which contains not three hou&s;es, &s;ends two members; and the town of Manche&s;ter, which contains upwards of &s;ixty thou&s;and &s;ouls, is not ad|mitted to &s;end any. Is there any principle in the&s;e things? Is there any thing by which you can trace the marks of freedom, or di&s;cover tho&s;e of wi&s;dom? No wonder, then, Mr. Burke has decli|ned the compari&s;on, and endeavoured to lead his readers from the point by a wild un&s;y&s;tematical di&s;play of paradoxical rhap&s;odies.</P>
<P>The French con&s;titution &s;ays, That the National A&s;&s;embly &s;hall be elected every two years.&mdash;What article will Mr. Burke place again&s;t this? Why, that the nation has no right at all in the ca&s;e: that the government is perfectly arbitrary with re&s;pect to this point; and he can quote for his au|thority, the precedent of a former parliament.</P>
<P>The French con&s;titution &s;ays, There &s;hall be no game laws; that the farmer on who&s;e lands wild game &s;hall be found (for it is by the produce of his lands they are fed) &s;hall have a right to what
<PB N="62" REF="64">
he can take: That there &s;hall be no monopolies of any kind&mdash;that all trade &s;hall be free, and every man free to follow any occupation by which he can procure an hone&s;t livelihood, and in any place, town or city throughout the nation.&mdash;What will Mr. Burke &s;ay to this? In England, game is made the property of tho&s;e at who&s;e expence it is not &s;ed; and with re&s;pect to monopolies, the country is cut up into monopolies. Every chartered town is an ari&s;tocratical monopoly in it&s;elf, and the qualification of electors proceeds out of tho&s;e char|tered monopolies. Is this freedom? Is this what Mr. Burke means by a con&s;titution?</P>
<P>In the&s;e chartered monopolies, a man coming from another part of the country, is hunted from them as if he were a foreign enemy. An Engli&s;h|man is not free of his own country: every one of tho&s;e places pre&s;ents a barrier in his way, and tells him he is not a freeman&mdash;that he has no rights. Within the&s;e monopolies, are other monopolies. In a city, &s;uch for in&s;tance as Bath, which contains between twenty and thirty thou&s;and inhabitants, the right of electing repre&s;entatives to parliament is monopoli&s;ed by about thirty-one per&s;ons. And within the&s;e monopolies are &s;till others. A man even of the &s;ame town, who&s;e parents were not in circum&s;tances to give him an occupation, is debar|red, in many ca&s;es, from the natural right of ac|quiring one, be his genius or indu&s;try what it may.</P>
<P>Are the&s;e things examples to hold out to a coun|try regenerating it&s;elf from &s;lavery, like France?&mdash; Certainly they are not; and certain am I, that when
<PB N="63" REF="65">
the people of England come to reflect upon them, they will, like France, annihilate tho&s;e badges of ancient oppre&s;&s;ion, tho&s;e traces of a conquered na|tion.&mdash;Had Mr. Burke po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed talents &s;imilar to the author "On the Wealth of Nations," he would have comprehended all the parts which enter into, and, by a&s;&s;emblage, form a con&s;titution. He would have rea&s;oned from minutiae to magnitude. It is not from his prejudices only, but from the di&s;orderly ca&s;t of his genius, that he is unfitted for the &s;ubject he writes upon. Even his genius is without a con&s;titution. It is a genius at random, and not a genius con&s;tituted. But he mu&s;t &s;ay &s;omething&mdash;He has therefore mounted in the air like a balloon, to draw the eyes of the multitude from the ground they &s;tand upon.</P>
<P>Much is to be learned from the French con&s;ti|tution. Conque&s;t and tyranny tran&s;planted them|&s;elves with William the Conqueror from Normandy into England, and the country is yet disfigured with the marks. May then the example of all France contribute to regenerate the freedom which a province of it de&s;troyed!</P>
<P>The French con&s;titution &s;ays, That to pre&s;erve the national repre&s;entation from being corrupt, no member of the National A&s;&s;embly &s;hall be an officer of the government, a place-man, or a pen|&s;ioner.&mdash;What will Mr. Burke place again&s;t this? I will whi&s;per his an&s;wer: <HI>Loaves</HI> and <HI>fi&s;hes.</HI> Ah! this government of loaves and fi&s;hes has more mi&s;|chief in it than people have yet reflected on. The National A&s;&s;embly has made the di&s;covery, and it
<PB N="64" REF="66">
holds out the example to the world. Had govern|ments agreed to quarrel on purpo&s;e to fleece their countries by taxes, they could not have &s;ucceeded better than they have done.</P>
<P>Many things in the Engli&s;h government appear to me the rever&s;e of what they ought to be, and of what they are &s;aid to be. The Parliament, imper|fectly and capriciou&s;ly elected as it is, is neverthe|le&s;s <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> to hold the national pur&s;e in <HI>tru&s;t</HI> for the nation: but in the manner in which an Engli&s;h parliament is con&s;tructed, it is like a man being both mortgager and mortgagee; and in the ca&s;e of mi&s;application of tru&s;t, it is the criminal &s;itting in judgment upon him&s;elf. If tho&s;e who vote the &s;upplies are the &s;ame per&s;ons who receive the &s;up|plies when voted, and are to account for the expen|diture of tho&s;e &s;upplies to tho&s;e who voted them, it is <HI>them&s;elves accountable to them&s;elves,</HI> and the Co|medy of Errors concludes with the Pantomine of HUSH. Neither the mini&s;terial party, nor the op|po&s;ition, will touch upon this ca&s;e. The national pur&s;e is the common hack which each mounts up|on. It is like what the country people call, <Q>Ride and tie&mdash;You ride a little way, and then I <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is a practice in &s;ome parts of the country, when two travellers have but one hor&s;e, which like the national pur&s;e will not carry dou|ble, that the one mounts and rides two or three miles a-head, and then ties the hor&s;e to a gate, and walks on. When the &s;econd travel|ler arrives, he takes the hor&s;e, rides on, and pa&s;&s;es his companion a mile or two, and ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e again; and &s;o on&mdash;<HI>Ride and tie.</HI></NOTE>.</Q>&mdash; They order the&s;e things better in France.</P>
<P>The French con&s;titution &s;ays, That the right of war and peace is in the nation. Where el&s;e &s;hould it re&s;ide, but in tho&s;e who are to pay the expence?</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="67">In England, this right is &s;aid to re&s;ide in a <HI>meta|phor,</HI> &s;hewn at the Tower for &s;ixpence or a &s;hilling a-piece: So are the lions; and it would be a &s;tep nearer to rea&s;on to &s;ay it re&s;ided in them, for any inanimate metaphor is no more than a hat or a cap. We can all &s;ee the ab&s;urdity of wor&s;hipping Aaron's molten calf, or Nebuchadnezzar's golden image; but why do men continue to practi&s;e them&s;elves the ab&s;urdities they de&s;pi&s;e in others?</P>
<P>It may with rea&s;on be &s;aid, that in the manner the Engli&s;h nation is repre&s;ented, it &s;ignifies not where this right re&s;ides, whether in the Crown, or in the Parliament. War is the common harve&s;t of all tho&s;e who participate in the divi&s;ion and ex|penditure of public money, in all countries. It is the art of <HI>conquering at home:</HI> the object of it is an increa&s;e of revenue; and as revenue cannot be increa&s;ed without taxes, a pretence mu&s;t be made for expenditures. In reviewing the hi&s;tory of the Engli&s;h government, its wars and its taxes, a by-&s;tander, not blinded by prejudice, nor warped by intere&s;t, would declare, that taxes were not rai&s;ed to carry on wars, but that wars were rai&s;ed to carry on taxes.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke, as a Member of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, is a part of the Engli&s;h Government; and though he profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf an enemy to war, he abu&s;es the French Con&s;titution, which &s;eeks to ex|plode it. He holds up the Engli&s;h Government as a model in all its parts, to France; but he &s;hould fir&s;t know the remarks which the French make upon it. They contend, in favour of their own,
<PB N="66" REF="68">
that the portion of liberty enjoyed in England, is ju&s;t enough to en&s;lave a country by, more produc|tively than by de&s;poti&s;m; and that as the real ob|ject of all de&s;poti&s;m is revenue, a Government &s;o formed obtains more than it could do either by di|rect de&s;poti&s;m, or in a full &s;tate of freedom, and is therefore, on the ground of intere&s;t, oppo&s;ed to both. They account al&s;o for the readine&s;s which always appears in &s;uch governments for engaging in wars, by remarking on the different motives which produce them. In de&s;potic governments, wars are the effect of pride; but in tho&s;e govern|ments in which they become the means of taxation, they acquire thereby a more permanent promptitude.</P>
<P>The French Con&s;titution, therefore, to provide again&s;t both the&s;e evils, has taken away the power of declaring war from kings and mini&s;ters, and placed the right where the expence mu&s;t fall.</P>
<P>When the que&s;tion on the right of war and peace was agitating in the National A&s;&s;embly, the people of England appeared to be much in|tere&s;ted in the event, and highly to applaud the deci&s;ion.&mdash;As a principle, it applies as much to one country as to another. William the Con|querer, <HI>as a conqueror,</HI> held this power of war and peace in him&s;elf, and his de&s;cendants have ever &s;ince claimed it under him as a right.</P>
<P>Although Mr. Burke has a&s;&s;erted the right of the parliament at the Revolution to bind and con|troul the nation and po&s;terity for <HI>ever,</HI> he denies, at the &s;ame time, that the parliament or the na|tion had any right to alter what he calls the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
<PB N="67" REF="69">
of the crown, in any thing but in part, or by a &s;ort of modification. By his taking this ground, he throws the ca&s;e back to the <HI>Norman Conque&s;t;</HI> and by thus running a line of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion &s;pringing from William the Conqueror to the pre&s;ent day, he makes it nece&s;&s;ary to enquire who and what William the Conqueror was, and where he came from; and into the origin, hi&s;tory, and nature of what are called perogatives. Every thing mu&s;t have had a beginning, and the fog of time and antiquity &s;hould be penetrated to di&s;|cover it. Let then Mr. Burke bring forward his William of Normandy, for it is to this origin that his argument goes. It al&s;o unfortunately happens, in running this line of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, that another line, parallel thereto, pre&s;ents it&s;elf, which is, that if the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion runs in the line of the con|que&s;t, the nation runs in the line of being con|quered, and it ought to re&s;cue it&s;elf from this reproach.</P>
<P>But it will perhaps be &s;aid, that tho' the power of declaring war de&s;cends in the heritage of the conque&s;t, it is held in check by the right of the parliament to with-hold the &s;upplies. It will always happen, when a thing is originally wrong, that amendments do not make it right; and it often happens, that they do as much mi&s;chief one way, as good the other: and &s;uch is the ca&s;e here; for if the one ra&s;hly declares war as a matter of right, and the other peremptorily with-holds the &s;upplies as a matter of right, the remedy becomes as bad, or wor&s;e than the di&s;ea&s;e. The one forces
<PB N="68" REF="70">
the nation to a combat, and the other ties its hands: but the more probable i&s;&s;ue is, that the conte&s;t will end in a collu&s;ion between the parties, and be made a &s;creen to both.</P>
<P>On this que&s;tion of war, three things are to be con&s;idered. Fir&s;t, the right of declaring it: Secondly, the expence of &s;upporting it: Thirdly, the mode of conducting it after it is declared. The French con&s;titution places the <HI>right</HI> where the <HI>expence</HI> mu&s;t fall, and this union can be only in the nation. The mode of conducting it after it is declared, it con&s;igns to the executive depart|ment.&mdash;Were this the ca&s;e in all countries, we &s;hould hear but little more of wars.</P>
<P>Before I proceed to con&s;ider other parts of the French con&s;titution, and by way of relieving the fatigue of argument, I will introduce an anecdote which I had from Dr. Frank|lin.&mdash;</P>
<P>While the Doctor re&s;ided in France as mini|&s;ter from America during the war, he had nume|rous propo&s;als made to him by projectors of every country and of every kind, who wi&s;hed to go to the land that floweth with milk and honey, America; and among the re&s;t, there was one who offered him&s;elf to be King. He introduced his propo&s;al to the Doctor by letter, which is now in the hands of M. Beaumarchais, of Paris&mdash;&s;tat|ing, fir&s;t, that as the Americans had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed or &s;ent away <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The word he u&s;ed was <HI>renvoy&eacute;,</HI> di&s;mi&s;&s;ed or &s;ent away.</NOTE> their King, that they would want
<PB N="69" REF="71">
another. Secondly, that him&s;elf was a Norman. Thirdly, that he was of a more ancient family than the Dukes of Normandy, and of a more honourable de&s;cent, his line having never been ba&s;tardized. Fourthly, that there was already a precedent in England, of Kings coming out of Normandy: and on the&s;e grounds he re&s;ted his offer, <HI>enjoining</HI> that the Doctor would forward it to America. But as the Doctor neither did this, nor yet &s;ent him an an&s;wer, the projector wrote a &s;econd letter; in which he did not, it is true, threaten to go over and conquer America, but only with great dignity propo&s;ed, that if his offer was not accepted, an acknowledg|ment of about &pound; 30,000 might be made to him for his genero&s;ity!&mdash;Now, as all arguments re&s;pecting &s;ucce&s;&s;ion mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily connect that &s;ucce&s;&s;ion with &s;ome beginning, Mr. Burke's arguments on this &s;ubject go to &s;hew, that there is no Engli&s;h origin of kings, and that they are de&s;cendants of the Norman line in right of the Conque&s;t. It may, therefore, be of &s;ervice to his doctrine to make this &s;tory known, and to inform him, that in ca&s;e of that natural extinction to which all mortality is &s;ubject, Kings may again be had from Normandy, on more rea&s;onable terms than William the Conqueror; and con&s;e|quently, that the good people of England, at the Revolution of 1688, <HI>might have done much bet|ter,</HI> had &s;uch a generous Norman as <HI>this</HI> known <HI>their</HI> wants, and they had known <HI>his.</HI> The chi|valry character which Mr. Burke &s;o much ad|mires,
<PB N="70" REF="72">
is certainly much ea&s;ier to make a bargain with, than a <HI>hard-dealing Dutchman.</HI>&mdash;But, to return to the matters of the con&s;titution&mdash;</P>
<P>The French con&s;titution &s;ays, <HI>There &s;hall be no titles;</HI> and of con&s;equence, all that cla&s;s of equivocal generation, which in &s;ome countries is called <HI>"ari&s;tocracy,"</HI> and in others <HI>"nobility,"</HI> is done away, and the <HI>peer</HI> is exalted into MAN.</P>
<P>Titles are but nick-names, and every nick-name is a title. The thing is perfectly harmle&s;s in it|&s;elf; but it marks a &s;ort of foppery in the human character, which degrades it. It reduces man into the diminutive of man in things which are great, and the counterfeit of woman in things which are little. It talks about its fine <HI>blue ribbon</HI> like a girl, and &s;hews its new <HI>garter</HI> like a child. A certain writer of &s;ome antiquity, &s;ays, <Q>When I was a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childi&s;h things.</Q></P>
<P>It is, properly, from the elevated mind of France, that the folly of titles has fallen. It has outgrown the baby-cloaths of <HI>Count</HI> and <HI>Duke,</HI> and breeched it&s;elf in manhood. France has not levelled; it has exalted. It has put down the dwarf, to &s;et up the man. The punyi&s;m of a &s;en&s;e|le&s;s word like <HI>Duke,</HI> or <HI>Count,</HI> or <HI>Earl,</HI> has cea&s;ed to plea&s;e. Even tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them have di&s;owned the gibberi&s;h, and as they outgrew the rickets, have de&s;pi&s;ed the rattle. The genuine mind of man, thir&s;ting for its native home, &s;oci|ety, contemns the gewgaws that &s;eparate him
<PB N="71" REF="73">
from it. Titles are like circles drawn by the ma|gician's wand, to contract the &s;phere of man's felicity. He lives immured within the Ba&s;tille of a word, and &s;urveys at a di&s;tance the envied life of man.</P>
<P>Is it then any wonder that titles &s;hould fall in France? Is it not a greater wonder they &s;hould be kept up any-where? What are they? What is their worth, and "what is their amount?" When we think or &s;peak of a <HI>Judge</HI> or a <HI>General,</HI> we a&s;&s;ociate with it the ideas of office and character; we think of gravity in the one, and bravery in the other: but when we u&s;e a word <HI>merely as a title,</HI> no ideas a&s;&s;ociate with it. Through all the vocabulary of Adam, there is not &s;uch an ani|mal as a Duke or a Count; neither can we connect any certain idea with the words. Whether they mean &s;trength or weakne&s;s, wi&s;dom or folly, a child or a man, or the rider or the hor&s;e, is all equi|vocal. What re&s;pect then can be paid to that which de&s;cribes nothing, and which means noth|ing? Imagination has given figure and character to centaurs, &s;atyrs, and down to all the fairy tribe; but titles baffle even the powers of fancy, and are a chimerical non-de&s;cript.</P>
<P>But this is not all.&mdash;If a whole country is di&s;|po&s;ed to hold them in contempt, all their value is gone, and none will own them. It is common opinion only that makes them any thing, or no|thing, or wor&s;e than nothing. There is no occa|&s;ion to take titles away, for they take them&s;elves away when &s;ociety concurs to ridicule them. This
<PB N="72" REF="74">
&s;pecies of imaginary con&s;equence has vi&s;ibly de|clined in every part of Europe, and it ha&s;tens to its exit as the world of rea&s;on continues to ri&s;e. There was a time when the lowe&s;t cla&s;s of what are called nobility was more thought of than the highe&s;t is now, and when a man in armour riding throughout Chri&s;tendom in que&s;t of adventures was more &s;tared at than a modern Duke. The world has &s;een this folly fall, and it has fallen by being laughed at, and the farce of titles will follow its fate.&mdash;The patriots of France have di&s;covered in good time, that rank and dignity in &s;ociety mu&s;t take a new ground. The old one has fallen through.&mdash;It mu&s;t now take the &s;ub&s;tantial ground of character, in&s;tead of the chimerical ground of titles; and they have brought their titles to the altar, and made of them a burnt-offering to Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>If no mi&s;chief had annexed it&s;elf to the folly of titles, they would not have been worth a &s;erious and formal de&s;truction, &s;uch as the National A&s;|&s;embly have decreed them: and this makes it nece&s;&s;ary to enquire farther into the nature and character of ari&s;tocracy.</P>
<P>That, then, which is called ari&s;tocracy in &s;ome countries, and nobility in others, aro&s;e out of the governments founded upon conque&s;t. It was origi|nally a military order, for the purpo&s;e of &s;upporting military government, (for &s;uch were all govern|ments founded in conque&s;t); and to keep up a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of this order for the purpo&s;e for which it was e&s;tabli&s;hed, all the younger branches of tho&s;e
<PB N="73" REF="75">
families were di&s;inherited, and the law of <HI>primoge|niture&s;hip</HI> &s;et up.</P>
<P>The nature and character of ari&s;tocracy &s;hews it|&s;elf to us in this law. It is a law again&s;t every law of nature, and Nature her&s;elf calls for its de&s;truc|tion. E&s;tabli&s;h family ju&s;tice, and ari&s;tocracy falls. By the ari&s;tocratical law of primogeniture&s;hip, in a family of &s;ix children, five are expo&s;ed. Ari&s;to|cracy has never more than <HI>one</HI> child. The re&s;t are begotten to be devoured. They are thrown to the cannibal for prey, and the natural parent prepares the unnatural repa&s;t.</P>
<P>As every thing which is out of nature in man, affects, more or le&s;s, the intere&s;t of &s;ociety, &s;o does this. All the children which the ari&s;tocracy di&s;|owns (which are all, except the elde&s;t) are, in ge|neral, ca&s;t like orphans on a pari&s;h, to be pro|vided for by the public, but at a greater charge.&mdash; Unnece&s;&s;ary offices and places in governments and courts are created at the expence of the public, to maintain them.</P>
<P>With what kind of parental reflections can the father or mother contemplate their younger off|&s;pring. By nature they are children, and by mar|riage they are heirs; but by ari&s;tocracy they are ba&s;tards and orphans. They are the fle&s;h and blood of their parents in one line, and nothing akin to them in the other. To re&s;tore, therefore, parents to their children, and children to their pa|rents&mdash;relations to each other, and man to &s;ociety &mdash;and to exterminate the mon&s;ter Ari&s;tocracy, root and branch&mdash;the French con&s;titution has de&s;troyed
<PB N="74" REF="76">
the law of PRIMOGENITURESHIP. Here then lies the mon&s;ter; and Mr. Burke, if he plea&s;es, may write its epitaph.</P>
<P>Hitherto we have con&s;idered ari&s;tocracy chiefly in one point of view. We have now to con&s;ider it in another. But whether we view it before or be|hind, or &s;ide-ways, or any way el&s;e, dome&s;tically or publicly, it is &s;till a mon&s;ter.</P>
<P>In France, ari&s;tocracy had one feature le&s;s in its countenance, than what it has in &s;ome other coun|tries. It did not compo&s;e a body of hereditary le|gi&s;lators. It was not <HI>"a corporation of ari&s;tocracy,"</HI> for &s;uch I have heard M. de la Fayette de&s;cribe an Engli&s;h Hou&s;e of Peers. Let us then examine the grounds upon which the French con&s;titution has re&s;olved again&s;t having &s;uch a Hou&s;e in France.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e, in the fir&s;t place, as is already men|tioned, ari&s;tocracy is kept up by family tyranny and inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Secondly, Becau&s;e there is an unnatural unfit|ne&s;s in an ari&s;tocracy to be legi&s;lators for a nation. Their ideas of <HI>di&s;tributive ju&s;tice</HI> are corrupted at the very &s;ource. They begin life by trampling on all their younger brothers and &s;i&s;ters, and relations of every kind, and are taught and educated &s;o to do. With what ideas of ju&s;tice or honour can that man enter a hou&s;e of legi&s;lation, who ab|&s;orbs in his own per&s;on the inheritance of a whole family of children, or doles out to them &s;ome piti|ful portion with the in&s;olence of a gift?</P>
<P>Thirdly, Becau&s;e the idea of hereditary legi&s;la|tors is as incon&s;i&s;tent as that of hereditary judges,
<PB N="75" REF="77">
or hereditary juries; and as ab&s;urd as an hereditary mathematician, or an hereditary wi&s;e man; and as ridiculous as an hereditary poet-laureat.</P>
<P>Fourthly, Becau&s;e a body of men holding them|&s;elves accountable to nobody, ought not to be tru&s;ted by any body.</P>
<P>Fifthly, Becau&s;e it is continuing the uncivilized principle of governments founded in conque&s;t, and the ba&s;e idea of man having property in man, and governing him by per&s;onal right.</P>
<P>Sixthly, Becau&s;e ari&s;tocracy has a tendency to degenerate the human &s;pecies.&mdash;By the univer&s;al oeconomy of nature it is known, and by the in|&s;tance of the Jews it is proved, that the human &s;pe|cies has a tendency to degenerate, in any &s;mall number of per&s;ons, when &s;eparated from the gene|ral &s;tock of &s;ociety, and intermarrying con&s;tantly with each other. It defeats even its pretended end, and becomes in time the oppo&s;ite of what is noble in man. Mr. Burke talks of nobility; let him &s;hew what it is. The greate&s;t characters the world have known, have ri&s;en on the democratic floor. Ari&s;t|ocracy has not been able to keep a proportionate pace with democracy. The artificial NOBLE &s;hrinks into a dwarf before the NOBLE of Nature; and in the few in&s;tances of tho&s;e (for there are &s;ome in all countries) in whom nature, as by a miracle, has &s;urvived in ari&s;tocracy, THOSE MEN DESPISE IT. &mdash;But it is time to proceed to a new &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The French con&s;titution has reformed the con|dition of the clergy. It has rai&s;ed the income of the lower and middle cla&s;&s;es, and taken from
<PB N="76" REF="78">
the higher. None is now le&s;s than twelve hun|dred livres (fifty pounds &s;terling), nor any higher than about two or three thou&s;and pounds. What will Mr. Burke place again&s;t this? Hear what he &s;ays.</P>
<P>He &s;ays, <Q>That the people of England can &s;ee without pain or grudging, an archbi&s;hop pre|cede a duke; they can &s;ee a bi&s;hop of Durham, or a bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &pound;. 10,000 a-year; and cannot &s;ee why it is in wor&s;e hands than e&s;tates to the like amount in the hands of this earl or that '&s;quire.</Q> And Mr. Burke offers this as an example to France.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t part, whether the archbi&s;hop precedes the duke, or the duke the bi&s;hop, it is, I believe, to the people in general, &s;omewhat like <HI>Sternhold</HI> and <HI>Hopkins,</HI> or <HI>Hopkins</HI> and <HI>Stern|hold;</HI> you may put which you plea&s;e fir&s;t: and as I confe&s;s that I do not under&s;tand the merits of this ca&s;e, I will not contend it with Mr. Burke.</P>
<P>But with re&s;pect to the latter, I have &s;omething to &s;ay.&mdash;Mr. Burke has not put the ca&s;e right.&mdash; The compari&s;on is out of order, by being put be|tween the bi&s;hop and the earl or the '&s;quire. It ought to be put between the bi&s;hop and the curate, and then it will &s;tand thus: &mdash;<HI>The people of England can &s;ee without pain or grudging, a bi&s;hop of Durham, or a bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of ten thou&s;and pounds a-year, and a curate on thirty or forty pounds a-year, or le&s;s.</HI>&mdash;No, Sir, they certainly do not &s;ee tho&s;e things without
<PB N="77" REF="79">
great pain or grudging. It is a ca&s;e that applies it&s;elf to every man's &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice, and is one among many that calls aloud for a con&s;titution.</P>
<P>In France, the cry of <HI>"the church! the church!"</HI> was repeated as often as in Mr. Burke's book, and as loudly as when the di&s;&s;enters' bill was be|fore the Engli&s;h parliament; but the generality of the French clergy were not to be deceived by this cry any longer. They knew, that whatever the pretence might be, it was them&s;elves who were one of the principal objects of it. It was the cry of the high beneficed clergy, to prevent any regulation of income taking place between tho&s;e of ten thou&s;and pounds a-year and the pari&s;h prie&s;t. They, therefore, joined their ca&s;e to tho&s;e of every other oppre&s;&s;ed cla&s;s of men, and by this union obtained redre&s;s.</P>
<P>The French con&s;titution has aboli&s;hed tythes, that &s;ource of perpetual di&s;content between the tythe-holder and the pari&s;hioner. When land is held on tythe, it is in the condition of an e&s;tate held between two parties; the one receiving one-tenth, and the other nine-tenths of the produce: and, con&s;equently, on principles of equity, if the e&s;tate can be improved, and made to produce by that improvement double or treble what it did before, or in any other ratio, the expence of &s;uch improvement ought to be borne in like propor|tion between the parties who are to &s;hare the pro|duce. But this is not the ca&s;e in tythes; the farmer bears the whole expence, and the tythe-holder takes a tenth of the improvement, in ad|dition
<PB N="78" REF="80">
to the original tenth, and by this means gets the value of two-tenths in&s;tead of one. This is another ca&s;e that calls for a con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The French con&s;titution hath aboli&s;hed or re|nounced <HI>Toleration,</HI> and <HI>Intolerance</HI> al&s;o, and hath e&s;tabli&s;hed UNIVERSAL RIGHT OF CONSCIENCE.</P>
<P>Toleration is not the <HI>oppo&s;ite</HI> of Intolerance, but is the <HI>counterfeit</HI> of it. Both are de&s;poti&s;ms. The one a&s;&s;umes to it&s;elf the right of with-hold|ing Liberty of Con&s;cience, and the other of granting it. The one is the pope armed with fire and faggot, and the other is the pope &s;elling or granting indulgencies. The former is church and &s;tate, and the latter is church and traffic.</P>
<P>But Toleration may be viewed in a much &s;tronger light. Man wor&s;hips not him&s;elf, but his Maker; and the liberty of con&s;cience which he claims, is not for the &s;ervice of him&s;elf, but of his God. In this ca&s;e, therefore, we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have the a&s;&s;ociated idea of two beings; the <HI>mortal</HI> who renders the wor&s;hip, and the IM|MORTAL BEING who is wor&s;hipped. Toleration, therefore, places it&s;elf, not between man and man, nor between church and church, nor be|tween one denomination of religion and ano|ther, but between God and man; between the being who wor&s;hips, and the BEING who is wor|&s;hipped; and by the &s;ame act of a&s;&s;umed autho|rity by which it tolerates man to pay his wor&s;hip, it pre&s;umptuou&s;ly and bla&s;phemou&s;ly &s;ets it&s;elf up to tolerate the Almighty to receive it.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="81">Were a Bill brought into any parliament, in|titled <Q>AN ACT to tolerate or grant liberty to the Almighty to receive the wor&s;hip of a Jew or a Turk,</Q> or <Q>to prohibit the Almighty from receiving it,</Q> all men would &s;tartle, and call it bla&s;phemy. There would be an uproar. The pre&s;umption of toleration in religious mat|ters would then pre&s;ent it&s;elf unma&s;ked: but the pre&s;umption is not the le&s;s becau&s;e the name of "Man" only appears to tho&s;e laws, for the a&s;&s;ociated idea of the <HI>wor&s;hipper</HI> and the <HI>wor&s;hip|ped</HI> cannot be &s;eparated.&mdash;Who, then, art thou, vain du&s;t and a&s;hes! by whatever name thou art called, whether a King, a Bi&s;hop, a Church or a State, a Parliament, or any thing el&s;e, that obtrude&s;t thine in&s;ignificance between the &s;oul of man and its Maker? Mind thine own concerns. If he believes not as thou believe&s;t, it is a proof that thou believe&s;t not as he believeth, and there is no earthly power can determine between you.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to what are called denominations of religion, if every one is left to judge of its own religion, there is no &s;uch thing as a religion that is wrong; but if they are to judge of each others religion, there is no &s;uch thing as a religion that is right; and therefore, all the world is right, or all the world is wrong. But with re&s;pect to religion it&s;elf, without regard to names, and as directing it&s;elf from the univer&s;al family of man|kind to the Divine object of all adoration, <HI>it is man bringing to his Maker the fruits of his heart;</HI> and though tho&s;e fruits may differ from each other
<PB N="80" REF="82">
like the fruits of the earth, the grateful tribute of every one is accepted.</P>
<P>A Bi&s;hop of Durham, or a Bi&s;hop of Winche|&s;ter, or the Archbi&s;hop who heads the Dukes, will not refu&s;e a tythe-&s;heaf of wheat, becau&s;e it is not a cock of hay; nor a cock of hay, becau&s;e it is not a &s;heaf of wheat; nor a pig, becau&s;e it is neither one nor the other: but the&s;e &s;ame per&s;ons, under the figure of an e&s;tabli&s;hed church, will not permit their Maker to receive the varied tythes of man's devotion.</P>
<P>One of the continual choru&s;es of Mr. Burke's book is, "Church and State." He does not mean &s;ome one particular church, or &s;ome one parti|cular &s;tate, but any church and &s;tate; and he u&s;es the term as a general figure to hold forth the po|litical doctrine of always uniting the church with the &s;tate in every country, and he cen&s;ures the National A&s;&s;embly for not having done this in France.&mdash;Let us be&s;tow a few thoughts on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>All religions are in their nature kind and be|nign, and united with principles of morality. They could not have made pro&s;elites at fir&s;t, by profe&s;&s;ing any thing that was vicious, cruel, per|&s;ecuting, or immoral. Like every thing el&s;e, they had their beginning; and they proceeded by per&s;ua&s;ion, exortation, and example. How then is it that they lo&s;e their native mildne&s;s, and become moro&s;e and intolerent?</P>
<P>It proceeds from the connection which Mr. Burke recommends. By engendering the church
<PB N="81" REF="83">
with the &s;tate, a &s;ort of mule animal, capable only of de&s;troying, and not of breeding up, is pro|duced, called <HI>The Church e&s;tabli&s;hed by Law.</HI> It is a &s;tranger, even from its birth, to any parent mother on which it is begotten, and whom in time it kicks out and de&s;troys.</P>
<P>The inqui&s;ition in Spain does not proceed from the religion originally profe&s;&s;ed, but from this mule-animal, engendered between the church and the &s;tate. The burnings in Smithfield proceeded from the &s;ame heterogeneous production; and it was the regeneration of this &s;trange animal in England afterwards, that renewed rancour and ir|religion among the inhabitants, and that drove the people called Quakers and Di&s;&s;enters to America. Per&s;ecution is not an original feature in <HI>any</HI> reli|gion; but it is always the &s;trongly-marked feature of all law-religions, or religions e&s;tabli&s;hed by law. Take away the law-e&s;tabli&s;hment, and every religion rea&s;&s;umes its original benignity. In Ame|rica, a Catholic Prie&s;t is a good citizen, a good character, and a good neighbour; an Epi&s;copa|lian Mini&s;ter is of the &s;ame de&s;cription: and this proceeds, independently of the men, from there being no law-e&s;tabli&s;hment in America.</P>
<P>If al&s;o we view this matter in a temporal &s;en&s;e, we &s;hall &s;ee the ill effects it has had on the pro&s;|perity of nations. The union of church and &s;tate has impoveri&s;hed Spain. The revoking the edict of Nantes drove the &s;ilk manufacture from France into England; and church and &s;tate are now driving the cotton manufacture from Eng|land
<PB N="82" REF="84">
to America and France. Let then Mr. Burke continue to preach his antipolitical doc|trine of Church and State. It will do &s;ome good. The National A&s;&s;embly will not follow his advice, but will benefit by his folly. It was by ob&s;erving the ill effects of it in England, that America has been warned again&s;t it; and it is by experiencing them in France, that the National A&s;&s;embly have aboli&s;hed it, and, like America, have e&s;tabli&s;hed UNIVERSAL RIGHT OF CONSCIENCE, AND UNI|VERSAL RIGHT OF CITIZENSHIP<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When in any country we &s;ee extraordinary circum&s;tances taking place, they naturally lead any man who has a talent for ob&s;ervation and inve&s;tigation, to enquire into the cau&s;es. The manufactures of Manche&s;ter, Birmingham, and Sheffield, are the principal ma|nufactures in England. From whence did this ari&s;e? A little ob|&s;ervation will explain the ca&s;e. The principal, and the generality of the inhabitants of tho&s;e places, are not of what is called in Eng|land, <HI>the church e&s;tabli&s;hed by law;</HI> and they, or their fathers, (for it is within but a few years), withdrew from the per&s;ecution of the chartered towns, where te&s;t-laws more particularly operate, and e&s;tabli&s;hed a &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rt of a&s;ylum for them&s;elves in tho&s;e places. It was the only a&s;ylum that then offered, for the re&s;t of Europe was wor&s;e.&mdash;But the ca&s;e is now changing. France and America bid a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> comers welcome, and initiate them into all the rights of citizen|&s;hip. Policy and intere&s;t, therefore, will, but perhaps too late, dic|tate in England, what rea&s;on and ju&s;tice could not. Tho&s;e manu|factures are withdrawing, and are ari&s;ing in other places. There is now erecting at Pa&s;&s;ey, three miles from Paris, a large cotton-mill, and &s;everal are already erected in America. Soon after the rejecting the Bill for repealing the te&s;t-law, one of the riche&s;t manufacture<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s in England &s;aid in my hearing, "England, Sir, is not a country for a di&s;&s;enter to live in&mdash;we mu&s;t go to France." The&s;e are truths, and it is doing ju&s;tice to both parties to tell them. It is chiefly the di&s;&s;enters who have carried Engli&s;h manufactures to the height they are now at, and the &s;ame men have it in their power to carry them away; and though tho&s;e manufactures will afterwards continue to be made in tho&s;e places, the foreign market will be lo&s;t. There are frequently appearing in the London Gazette, extracts from certain acts to prevent machines and per&s;ons, as far as they can extend to per&s;ons, from going out of the country. It appears from the&s;e, that the ill effects of the te&s;t-laws and church-e&s;tabli&s;hment begin to be much &s;u&s;pected; but the remedy of force can never &s;upply the re|medy of rea&s;on. In the progre&s;s of le&s;s than a century, all the un|repre&s;ented part of England, of all denominations, which is at lea&s;t a hundred times the mo&s;t numerous, may begin to feel the nece&s;&s;ity of a con&s;titution, and then all tho&s;e matters will come regularly be|fore them.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I will here cea&s;e the compari&s;on with re&s;pect to the principles of the French con&s;titution, and conclude this part of the &s;ubject with a few ob|&s;ervations on the organization of the formal parts of the French and Engli&s;h governments.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="85">The executive power in each country is in the hands of a per&s;on &s;tiled the King; but the French con&s;titution di&s;tingui&s;hes between the King and the Sovereign: It con&s;iders the &s;tation of King as official, and places Sovereignty in the nation.</P>
<P>The repre&s;entatives of the nation, who com|po&s;e the National A&s;&s;embly, and who are the le|gi&s;lative power, originate in and from the people by election, as an inherent right in the people.&mdash; In England it is otherwi&s;e; and this ari&s;es from the original e&s;tabli&s;hment of what is called its monarchy; for, as by the conque&s;t all the rights of the people or the nation were ab&s;orbed into the hands of the Conqueror, and who added the title of King to that of Conqueror, tho&s;e &s;ame matters which in France are now held as rights in the people, or in the nation, are held in Eng|land as grants from what is called the Crown.
<PB N="84" REF="86">
The Parliament in England, in both its branches, was erected by patents from the de&s;cendants of the Conqueror. The Hou&s;e of Commons did not originate as a matter of right in the people to de|legate or elect, but as a grant or boon.</P>
<P>By the French con&s;titution, the Nation is always named before the King. The third article of the Declaration of rights &s;ays, "<HI>The nation is e&s;&s;ential|ly the &s;ource</HI> (or fountain) <HI>of all &s;overeignty.</HI>" Mr. Burke argues, that, in England, a King is the fountain&mdash;that he is the fountain of all honour. But as this idea is evidently de&s;cended from the Conque&s;t, I &s;hall make no other remark upon it, than that it is the nature of conque&s;t to turn every thing up&s;ide down; and as Mr. Burke will not be refu&s;ed the privilege of &s;peaking twice, and as there are but two parts in the figure, the <HI>fountain</HI> and the <HI>&s;pout,</HI> he will be right the &s;econd time.</P>
<P>The French con&s;titution puts the legi&s;lative be|fore the executive; the Law before the King; <HI>La Loi, Le Roi.</HI> This al&s;o is in the natural order of things; becau&s;e laws mu&s;t have exi&s;tence, be|fore they can have execution.</P>
<P>A King in France does not, in addre&s;&s;ing him|&s;elf to the National A&s;&s;embly, &s;ay, "My a&s;&s;em|bly," &s;imilar to the phra&s;e u&s;ed in England of "<HI>my</HI> Parliament;" neither can he u&s;e it con&s;i&s;tently with the con&s;titution, nor could it be admitted. There may be propriety in the u&s;e of it in Eng|land, becau&s;e, as is before mentioned, both Hou&s;es of Parliament originated from what is called the Crown by patent or boon&mdash;and not from the
<PB N="85" REF="87">
inherent rights of the people, as the National A&s;&s;embly does in France, and who&s;e name de&s;ig|nates its origin.</P>
<P>The Pre&s;ident of the National A&s;&s;embly does not a&s;k the King <HI>to grant to the A&s;&s;embly liberty of &s;peech,</HI> as is the ca&s;e with the Engli&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons. The con&s;titutional dignity of the National A&s;&s;embly cannot deba&s;e it&s;elf. Speech is, in the fir&s;t place, one of the natural rights of man always retained; and with re&s;pect to the Na|tional A&s;&s;embly, the u&s;e of it is their <HI>duty,</HI> and the nation is their <HI>authority.</HI> They were elected by the greate&s;t body of men exerci&s;ing the right of election the European world ever &s;aw. They &s;prung not from the filth of rotten boroughs, nor are they the va&s;&s;al repre&s;entatives of ari&s;tocratical ones. Feeling the proper dignity of their cha|racter, they &s;upport it. Their parliamentary lan|guage, whether for or again&s;t a que&s;tion, is free, bold, and manly, and extends to all the parts and circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e. If any matter or &s;ub|ject re&s;pecting the executive department, or the per&s;on who pre&s;ides in it, (the King), comes be|fore them, it is debated on with the &s;pirit of men, and the language of gentlemen; and their an&s;wer, or their addre&s;s, is returned in the &s;ame &s;tile. They &s;tand not aloof with the gaping vacuity of vulgar ignorance, nor bend with the cringe of &s;ycophantic in&s;ignificance. The graceful pride of truth knows no extremes, and pre&s;erves, in every latitude of life, the right-angled character of man.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="88">Let us now look to the other &s;ide of the que&s;|tion.&mdash;In the addre&s;&s;es of the Engli&s;h Parliaments to their Kings, we &s;ee neither the intrepid &s;pirit of the old Parliaments of France, nor the &s;erene dignity of the pre&s;ent National A&s;&s;embly; neither do we &s;ee in them any thing of the &s;tile of Eng|li&s;h manners, which border &s;omewhat on blunt|ne&s;s. Since then they are neither of foreign ex|traction, nor naturally of Engli&s;h production, their origin mu&s;t be &s;ought for el&s;ewhere, and that ori|gin is the Norman Conque&s;t. They are evidently of the va&s;&s;alage cla&s;s of manners, and emphati|cally mark the pro&s;trate di&s;tance that exi&s;ts in no other condition of men than between the conquer|or and the conquered. That this va&s;&s;alage idea and &s;tile of &s;peaking was not got rid of even at the Revolution of 1688, is evident from the de|claration of Parliament to William and Mary, in the&s;e words: <Q>We do mo&s;t humbly and faith|fully <HI>&s;ubmit</HI> our&s;elves, our heirs and po&s;terities, for ever.</Q> Submi&s;&s;ion is wholly a va&s;&s;alage term, requgnant to the dignity of Freedom, and an echo of the language u&s;ed at the Conque&s;t.</P>
<P>As the e&s;timation of all things is by compari&s;on, the Revolution of 1688, however from circum|&s;tances it may have been exalted beyond its va|lue, will find its level. It is already on the wane, eclip&s;ed by the enlarging orb of rea&s;on, and the luminous revolutions of America and France. In le&s;s than another century, it will go, as well as Mr. Burke's labours, "to the family vault of all the Capulets." Mankind will then &s;carcely believe
<PB N="87" REF="89">
that a country calling it&s;elf free, would &s;end to Holland for a man, and clothe him with power, on purpo&s;e to put them&s;elves in fear of him, and give him almo&s;t a million &s;terling a-year for leave to <HI>&s;ubmit</HI> them&s;elves and their po&s;terity, like bond-men and bond-women, for ever.</P>
<P>But there is a truth that ought to be made known: I have had the opportunity of &s;eeing it; which is, <HI>that, notwith&s;tanding appearances, there is not any de&s;cription of men that de&s;pi&s;e monarchy &s;o much as courtiers.</HI> But they well know, that if it were &s;een by others, as it is &s;een by them, the juggle could not be kept up. They are in the con|dition of men who get their living by a &s;how, and to whom the folly of that &s;how is &s;o familiar that they ridicule it; but were the audience to be made as wi&s;e in this re&s;pect as them&s;elves, there would be an end to the &s;how and the profits with it. The difference between a republican and a cour|tier with re&s;pect to monarchy, is, that the one op|po&s;es monarchy, believing it to be &s;omething; and the other laughs at it, knowing it to be nothing.</P>
<P>As I u&s;ed &s;ometimes to corre&s;pond with Mr. Burke, believing him then to be a man of &s;ounder principles than his book &s;hews him to be, I wrote to him la&s;t winter from Paris, and gave him an account how pro&s;perou&s;ly matters were going on. Among other &s;ubjects in that letter, I referred to the happy &s;ituation the National A&s;&s;embly were placed in; that they had taken a ground on which their moral duty and their political intere&s;t were united. They have not to hold out a language
<PB N="88" REF="90">
which they do not them&s;elves believe, for the fraudulent purpo&s;e of making others believe it. Their &s;tation requires no artifice to &s;upport it, and can only be maintained by enlightening mankind. It is not their intere&s;t to cheri&s;h ignorance, but to di&s;pel it. They are not in the ca&s;e of a mini&s;terial or an oppo&s;ition party in England, who, though they are oppo&s;ed, are &s;till united to keep up the common my&s;tery. The National A&s;&s;embly mu&s;t throw open a magazine of light. It mu&s;t &s;hew man the proper character of man; and the nearer it can bring him to that &s;tandard, the &s;tronger the National A&s;&s;embly becomes.</P>
<P>In contemplating the French con&s;titution, we &s;ee in it a rational order of things. The princi|ples harmoni&s;e with the forms, and both with their origin. It may perhaps be &s;aid as an excu&s;e for bad forms, that they are nothing more than forms; but this is a mi&s;take. Forms grow out of principles, and operate to continue the prin|ciples they grow from. It is impo&s;&s;ible to prac|ti&s;e a bad form on any thing but a bad principle. It cannot be ingrafted on a good one; and where|ever the forms in any government are bad, it is a certain indication that the principles are bad al&s;o.</P>
<P>I will here finally clo&s;e this &s;ubject. I began it by remarking that Mr. Burke had <HI>voluntarily</HI> de|clined going into a compari&s;on of the Engli&s;h and French con&s;titutions. He apologi&s;es (in page 241) for not doing it, by &s;aying that he had not time. Mr. Burke's book was upwards of eight months in hand, and is extended to a volume of
<PB N="89" REF="91">
three hundred and &s;ixty-&s;ix pages. As his omi&s;|&s;ion does injury to his cau&s;e, his apology makes it wor&s;e; and men on the Engli&s;h &s;ide the water will begin to con&s;ider, whether there is not &s;ome radical defect in what is called the Engli&s;h con|&s;titution, that made it nece&s;&s;ary for Mr. Burke to &s;uppre&s;s the compari&s;on, to avoid bringing it into view.</P>
<P>As Mr. Burke has not written on con&s;titutions, &s;o neither has he written on the French revolution. He gives no account of its commencement or its progre&s;s. He only expre&s;&s;es his wonder. "It looks," &s;ays he, <Q>to me, as if I were in a great cri&s;is, not of the affairs of France alone, but of all Europe, perhaps of more than Europe. All circum&s;tances taken together, the French revolution is the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing that has hitherto happened in the world.</Q></P>
<P>As wi&s;e men are a&s;toni&s;hed at fooli&s;h things, and other people at wi&s;e ones, I know not on which ground to account for Mr. Burke's a&s;to|ni&s;hment; but certain it is, that he does not un|der&s;tand the French revolution. It has apparently bur&s;t forth like a creation from a chaos, but it is no more than the con&s;equence of a mental revolu|tion priorily exi&s;ting in France. The mind of the nation had changed before hand, and the new order of things has naturally followed the new order of thoughts.&mdash;I will here, as conci&s;ely as I can, trace out the growth of the French revolu|tion, and mark the circum&s;tances that have con|tributed to produce it.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="92">The de&s;poti&s;m of Louis XIV. united with the gaiety of his Court, and the gaudy o&s;tentation of his character, had &s;o humbled, and at the &s;ame time &s;o fa&s;cinated the mind of France, that the people appeared to have lo&s;t all &s;en&s;e of their own dignity, in contemplating that of their grand Mo|narch: and the whole reign of Louis XV. re|markable only for weakne&s;s and effeminacy, made no other alteration than that of &s;preading a &s;ort of lethargy over the nation, from which it &s;hewed no di&s;po&s;ition to ri&s;e.</P>
<P>The only &s;igns which appeared of the &s;pirit of Liberty during tho&s;e periods, are to be found in the writings of the French philo&s;ophers. Mon|te&s;quieu, pre&s;ident of the Parliament of Bour|deaux, went as far as a writer under a de&s;potic government could well proceed; and being obliged to divide him&s;elf between principle and prudence, his mind often appears under a veil, and we ought to give him credit for more than he has expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Voltaire, who was both the flatterer and the &s;atiri&s;t of de&s;poti&s;m, took another line. His forte lay in expo&s;ing and ridiculing the &s;uper&s;ti|tions which prie&s;t-craft united with &s;tate-craft had interwoven with governments. It was not from the purity of his principles, or his love of mankind, (for &s;atire and philanthropy are not naturally concordant), but from his &s;trong capa|city of &s;eeing folly in its true &s;hape, and his ir|re&s;i&s;tible propen&s;ity to expo&s;e it, that he made tho&s;e attacks. They were however as formida|ble
<PB N="91" REF="93">
as if the motives had been virtuous; and he merits the thanks, rather than the e&s;teem of man|kind.</P>
<P>On the contrary, we find in the writings of Rou&s;&s;eau, and the Abb&eacute; Raynal, a loveline&s;s of &s;entiment in favour of Liberty, that excites re|&s;pect, and elevates the human faculties; but having rai&s;ed this animation, they do not direct its operations, and leave the mind in love with an object, without de&s;cribing the means of po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing it.</P>
<P>The writings of Que&s;nay, Turgot, and the friends of tho&s;e authors, are of the &s;erious kind; but they laboured under the &s;ame di&s;advantage with Monte&s;quieu: their writings abound with moral maxims of government, but are rather directed to oeconomi&s;e and reform the admini&s;tration of the government, than the government it&s;elf.</P>
<P>But all tho&s;e writings and many others had their weight; and by the different manner in which they treated the &s;ubject of government, Monte&s;quieu by his judgment and knowledge of laws, Voltaire by his wit, Rou&s;&s;eau and Ray|nal by their animation, and Que&s;nay and Turgot by their moral maxims and &s;y&s;tems of oeconomy, readers of every cla&s;s met with &s;omething to their ta&s;te, and a &s;pirit of political enquiry began to diffu&s;e it&s;elf through the nation at the time the di&s;pute between England and the then colonies of America broke out.</P>
<P>In the war which France afterwards engaged in, it is very well known that the nation appeared
<PB N="92" REF="94">
to be before hand with the French mini&s;try. Each of them had its view: but tho&s;e views were di|rected to different objects; the one &s;ought liberty, and the other retaliation on England. The French officers and &s;oldiers who after this went to Ame|rica, were eventually placed in the &s;chool of Freedom, and learned the practice as well as the principles of it by heart.</P>
<P>As it was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;eparate the military events which took place in America from the principles of the American revolution, the pub|lication of tho&s;e events in France nece&s;&s;arily con|nected them&s;elves with the principles which pro|duced them. Many of the facts were in them|&s;elves principles; &s;uch as the declaration of American independence, and the treaty of alliance between France and America, which recogni&s;ed the natural right of man, and ju&s;tified re&s;i&s;tance to oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The then Mini&s;ter of France, Count Vergennes, was not the friend of America; and it is both ju&s;tice and gratitude to &s;ay, that it was the Queen of France who gave the cau&s;e of America a fa&s;hion at the French Court. Count Vergennes was the per&s;onal and &s;ocial friend of Dr. Frank|lin; and the Doctor had obtained, by his &s;en&s;ible gracefulne&s;s, a &s;ort of influence over him; but with re&s;pect to principles, Count Vergennes was a de&s;pot.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of Dr. Franklin as Mini&s;ter from America to France, &s;hould be taken into the
<PB N="93" REF="95">
chain of circum&s;tances. The diplomatic cha|racter is of it&s;elf the narrowe&s;t &s;phere of &s;ociety that man can act in. It forbids intercour&s;e by a reciprocity of &s;u&s;picion; and a diplomatic is a &s;ort of unconnected atom, continually repelling and repelled. But this was not the ca&s;e with Dr. Franklin. He was not the diplomatic of a Court, but of MAN. His character as a philo&s;opher had been long e&s;tabli&s;hed, and his circle of &s;ociety in France was univer&s;al.</P>
<P>Count Vergennes re&s;i&s;ted for a con&s;iderable time the publication in France of the American con&s;titutions, tran&s;lated into the French language; but even in this he was obliged to give way to public opinion, and a &s;ort of propriety in admit|ting to appear what he had undertaken to defend. The American con&s;titutions were to liberty, what a grammar is to language: they define its parts of &s;peech, and practically con&s;truct them into &s;yntax.</P>
<P>The peculiar &s;ituation of the then Marquis de la Fayette is another link in the great chain. He &s;erved in America as an American officer un|der a commi&s;&s;ion of Congre&s;s, and by the univer|&s;ality of his acquaintance, was in clo&s;e friend&s;hip with the civil government of America, as well as with the military line. He &s;poke the language of the country, entered into the di&s;cu&s;&s;ions on the principles of government, and was always a wel|come friend at any election.</P>
<P>When the war clo&s;ed, a va&s;t reinforcement to the cau&s;e of Liberty &s;pread it&s;elf over France, by
<PB N="94" REF="96">
the return of the French officers and &s;oldiers. A knowledge of the practice was then joined to the theory; and all that was wanting to give it real exi&s;tence, was opportunity. Man cannot, pro|perly &s;peaking, make circum&s;tances for his pur|po&s;e, but he always has it in his power to improve them when they occur; and this was the ca&s;e in France.</P>
<P>M. Neckar was di&s;placed in May 1781; and by the ill management of the finances afterwards, and particularly during the extravagant admini|&s;tration of M. Calonne, the revenue of France, which was nearly twenty-four millions &s;terling <HI>per</HI> year, was become unequal to the expenditure, not becau&s;e the revenue had decrea&s;ed, but becau&s;e the expences had increa&s;ed; and this was the cir|cum&s;tance which the nation laid hold of to bring forward a revolution. The Engli&s;h Mini&s;ter, Mr. Pitt, has frequently alluded to the &s;tate of the French finances in his budgets, without un|der&s;tanding the &s;ubject. Had the French Parlia|ments been as ready to regi&s;ter edicts for new taxes, as an Engli&s;h Parliament is to grant them, there had been no derangement in the finances, nor yet any revolution; but this will better ex|plain it&s;elf as I proceed.</P>
<P>It will be nece&s;&s;ary here to &s;hew how taxes were formerly rai&s;ed in France. The King, or rather the Court or Mini&s;try acting under the u&s;e of that name, framed the edicts for taxes at their own di&s;cretion, and &s;ent them to the Parliaments to be regi&s;tered; for until they were regi&s;tered
<PB N="95" REF="97">
by the Parliaments, they were not operative. Di&s;|putes had long exi&s;ted between the Court and the Parliaments with re&s;pect to the extent of the Par|liament's authority on this head. The Court in&s;i&s;ted that the authority of Parliaments went no farther than to remon&s;trate or &s;hew rea&s;ons again&s;t the tax, re&s;erving to it&s;elf the right of determining whether the rea&s;ons were well or ill-founded; and in con&s;equence thereof, either to withdraw the edict as a matter of choice, or to <HI>order</HI> it to be enregi&s;tered as a matter of authority. The Par|liaments on their part in&s;i&s;ted, that they had not only a right to remon&s;trate, but to reject; and on this ground they were always &s;upported by the Nation.</P>
<P>But, to return to the order of my narrative&mdash; M. Calonne wanted money; and as he knew the &s;turdy di&s;po&s;ition of the Parliaments with re&s;pect to new taxes, he ingeniou&s;ly &s;ought either to approach them by a more gentle means than that of direct authority, or to get over their heads by a manoeuvre: and, for this purpo&s;e, he revived the project of a&s;&s;embling a body of men from the &s;everal provinces, under the &s;tile of an "A&s;&s;em|bly of the Notables," or Men of Note, who met in 1787, and who were either to recommend taxes to the Parliaments, or to act as a Parlia|ment them&s;elves. An A&s;&s;embly under this name had been called in 1617.</P>
<P>As we are to view this as the fir&s;t practical &s;tep towards the revolution, it will be proper to enter into &s;ome particulars re&s;pecting it. The A&s;&s;em|bly
<PB N="96" REF="98">
of the Notables has in &s;ome places been mi&s;|taken for the States-General, but was wholly a different body; the States-General being always by election. The per&s;ons who compo&s;ed the A&s;|&s;embly of the Notables were all nominated by the King, and con&s;i&s;ted of one hundred and forty members. But as M. Calonne could not depend upon a majority of this A&s;&s;embly in his favour, he very ingeniou&s;ly arranged them in &s;uch a man|ner as to make forty-four a majority of one hun|dred and forty: to effect this, he di&s;po&s;ed of them into &s;even &s;eparate committees, of twenty mem|bers each. Every general que&s;tion was to be decided, not by a majority of per&s;ons, but by a majority of committees; and as eleven votes would make a majority in a committee, and four committees a majority of &s;even, M. Calonne had good rea&s;on to conclude, that as forty-four would determine any general que&s;tion, he could not be out-voted. But all his plans deceived him, and in the event became his overthrow.</P>
<P>The then Marquis de la Fayette was placed in the &s;econd committee, of which Count D'Artois was pre&s;ident: and as money-matters was the object, it naturally brought into view every cir|cum&s;tance connected with it. M. de la Fayette made a verbal charge again&s;t Calonne, for &s;elling crown-lands to the amount of two millions of livres, in a manner that appeared to be unknown to the King. The Count D'Artois (as if to inti|midate, for the Ba&s;tille was then in being) a&s;ked the Marquis, if he would render the charge in
<PB N="97" REF="99">
writing? He replied, that he would.&mdash;The Count D'Artois did not demand it, but brought a me&s;&s;age from the King to that purport. M. de la Fayette then delivered in his charge in writing, to be given to the King, undertak|ing to &s;upport it. No farther proceedings were had upon this affair; but M. Calonne was &s;oon after di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by the King, and &s;et off to England.</P>
<P>As M. de la Fayette, from the experience of what he had &s;een in America, was better ac|quainted with the &s;cience of civil government than the generality of the members who com|po&s;ed the A&s;&s;embly of the Notables could then be, the brunt of the bu&s;ine&s;s fell con&s;iderably to his &s;hare. The plan of tho&s;e who had a con&s;titu|tion in view, was to contend with the Court on the ground of taxes, and &s;ome of them openly profe&s;&s;ed their object. Di&s;putes frequently aro&s;e between Count D'Artois and M. de la Fayette, upon various &s;ubjects. With re&s;pect to the ar|rears already incurred, the latter propo&s;ed to remedy them, by accommodating the expences to the revenue, in&s;tead of the revenue to the expences; and as objects of reform, he pro|po&s;ed to aboli&s;h the Ba&s;tille, and all the State-pri&s;ons throughout the nation, (the keeping of which was attended with great expence), and to &s;uppre&s;s <HI>Lettres de Cachet:</HI> But tho&s;e matters were not then much attended to; and with re&s;pect to <HI>Lettres de Cachet, a majority of the Nobles appeared to be in favour of them.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="100">On the &s;ubject of &s;upplying the Trea&s;ury by new taxes, the A&s;&s;embly declined taking the matter on them&s;elves, concurring in the opini|on that they had not authority. In a debate on this &s;ubject, M. de la Fayette &s;aid, that rai&s;ing money by taxes could only be done by a Na|tional A&s;&s;embly, freely elected by the people, and acting as their repre&s;entatives. Do you mean, &s;aid the Count D'Artois, the <HI>States Ge|neral?</HI> M. de la Fayette replied, that he did. Will you, &s;aid the Count D'Artois, &s;ign what you &s;ay, to be given to the King? The other replied, that he not only would do this, but that he would go farther, and &s;ay, that the effectual mode would be, for the King to agree to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>As one of the plans had thus failed, that of getting the A&s;&s;embly to act as a Praliament, the other came into view, that of recom|mending. On this &s;ubject, the A&s;&s;embly agreed to recommend two new taxes to be enregi&s;tered by the Parliament: The one a &s;tamp-tax, and the other a territorial tax, or &s;ort of land-tax. The two have been e&s;timated at about five millions &s;terl. <HI>per ann.</HI> We have now to turn our atten|tion to the Parliaments, on whom the bu&s;ine&s;s was again devolving.</P>
<P>The Archbi&s;hop of Thoulou&s;e (&s;ince Arch|bi&s;hop of Sens, and now a Cardinal) was ap|pointed to the admini&s;tration of the finances, &s;oon after the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of Calonne. He was al&s;o made Prime Mini&s;ter, an office that did not
<PB N="99" REF="101">
always exi&s;t in France. When this office did not exi&s;t, the Chief of each of the principal de|partments tran&s;acted bu&s;ine&s;s immediately with the King; but when a Prime Mini&s;ter was ap|pointed, they did bu&s;ine&s;s only with him. The Archbi&s;hop arrived to more State-authority than any Mini&s;ter &s;ince the Duke de Choi&s;eul, and the nation was &s;trongly di&s;po&s;ed in his fa|vour; but by a line of conduct &s;carcely to be accounted for, he perverted every opportunity, turned out a de&s;pot, and &s;unk into di&s;grace, and a Cardinal.</P>
<P>The A&s;&s;embly of the Notables having broken up, the new Mini&s;ter &s;ent the edicts for the two new taxes recommended by the A&s;&s;embly to the Parliaments, to be enregi&s;tered. They of cour&s;e came fir&s;t before the parliament of Paris, who returned for an&s;wer, <HI>That with &s;uch a reve|nue as the Nation then &s;upported, the name of taxes ought not to be mentioned, but for the purpo&s;e of reducing them;</HI> and threw both the edicts out <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When the Engli&s;h Mini&s;ter, Mr. Pitt, mentions the French finances again in the Engli&s;h Parliament, it would be well that he noticed this as an example.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On this refu&s;al, the Parliament was ordered to Ver&s;ailles, where, in the u&s;ual form, the King held, what under the old government was called, a Bed of Ju&s;tice; and the two edicts were enregi&s;tered in pre&s;ence of the Parliament, by an order of State, in the manner mentioned in page 94. On this, the Parliament immedi|ately returned to Paris, renewed their &s;e&s;&s;ion in
<PB N="100" REF="102">
form, and ordered the enregi&s;tering to be &s;truck out, declaring that every thing done at Ver|&s;ailles was illegal. All the members of the Parliament were then &s;erved with Lettres de Cachet, and exiled to Trois; but as they con|tinued as inflexible in exile as before, and as vengeance did not &s;upply the place of taxes, they were after a &s;hort time recalled to Paris.</P>
<P>The edicts were again tendered to them, and the Count D'Artois undertook to act as repre|&s;entative of the King. For this purpo&s;e, he came from Ver&s;ailles to Paris, in a train of pro|ce&s;&s;ion; and the Parliament were a&s;&s;embled to receive him. But &s;how and parade had lo&s;t their influence in France; and whatever ideas of im|portance he might &s;et off with, he had to return with tho&s;e of mortification and di&s;appointment. On alighting from his carriage to a&s;cend the &s;teps of the Parliament Hou&s;e, the crowd (which was numerou&s;ly collected) threw out trite expre&s;&s;ions, &s;aying <Q>This is Mon&s;ieur D'Artois, who wants more of our money to &s;pend.</Q> The marked di&s;approbation which he &s;aw, impre&s;&s;ed him with apprehen&s;ions; and the word <HI>Aux armes! (To arms!)</HI> was given out by the officer of the guard who attended him. It was &s;o loudly vociferated, that it echoed through the avenues of the Hou&s;e, and produced a temporary confu&s;ion: I was then &s;tanding in one of the apartments through which he had to pa&s;s, and could not avoid re|flecting
<PB N="101" REF="103">
how wretched was the condition of a di&s;re&s;pected man.</P>
<P>He endeavoured to impre&s;s the Parliament by great words, and opened his authority by &s;aying, "The King, our Lord and Ma&s;ter." The Parliament received him very coolly, and with their u&s;ual determination not to regi&s;ter the taxes: and in this manner the interview ended.</P>
<P>After this a new &s;ubject took place: In the various debates and conte&s;ts which aro&s;e between the Court and the Parliaments on the &s;ubject of taxes, the Parliament of Paris at la&s;t de|clared, that although it had been cu&s;tomary for Parliaments to enregi&s;ter edicts for taxes as a matter of convenience, the right belonged on|ly to the <HI>States-General;</HI> and that, therefore, the Parliament could no longer with propriety continue to debate on what it had not authority to act. The King after this came to Paris, and held a meeting with the Parliament, in which he continued from ten in the morning till about &s;ix in the evening; and, in a manner that ap|peared to proceed from him, as if uncon&s;ulted upon with the cabinet or the mini&s;try, gave his word to the Parliament, that the States-General &s;hould be convened.</P>
<P>But after this another &s;cene aro&s;e, on a ground different from all the former. The mini&s;ter and the cabinet were aver&s;e to calling the States-General: They well knew, that if the States-General were a&s;&s;embled, them&s;elves mu&s;t
<PB N="102" REF="104">
fall; and as the King had not mentioned <HI>any time,</HI> they hit on a project calculated to elude, without appearing to oppo&s;e.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e, the Court &s;et about making a &s;ort of con&s;titution it&s;elf: It was principally the work of M. Lamoignon, Keeper of the Seals, who afterwards &s;hot him&s;elf. This new arrangement con&s;i&s;ted in e&s;tabli&s;hing a body un|der the name of a <HI>Cour pl&eacute;niere,</HI> or full Court, in which were inve&s;ted all the powers that the government might have occa&s;ion to make u&s;e of. The per&s;ons compo&s;ing this Court were to be nominated by the King; the contended right of taxation was given up on the part of the King, and a new criminal code of laws, and law proceedings, was &s;ub&s;tituted in the room of the former. The thing, in many points, contained better principles than tho&s;e upon which the government had hitherto been ad|mini&s;tered: but with re&s;pect to the <HI>Cour pl&eacute;niere,</HI> it was no other than a medium through which de&s;poti&s;m was to pa&s;s, without appearing to act directly from it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Cabinet had high expectations from their new contrivance. The per&s;ons who were to compo&s;e the <HI>Cour pl&eacute;niere,</HI> were already nomi|nated; and as it was nece&s;&s;ary to carry a fair appearance, many of the be&s;t characters in the the nation were appointed among the number. It was to commence on the 8th of May 1788: But an oppo&s;ition aro&s;e to it, on two grounds&mdash; the one as to principle, the other as to form.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="105">On the ground of Principle it was contended, That government had not a right to alter it&s;elf; and that if the practice was once admitted, it would grow into a principle, and be made a precedent for any future alterations the govern|ment might wi&s;h to e&s;tabli&s;h: That the right of altering the government was a national right, and not a right of government.&mdash;And on the ground of Form, it was contended, That the <HI>Cour pl&eacute;niere</HI> was nothing more than a larger Cabinet.</P>
<P>The then Duke de la Rochefoucault, Lux|embourg, De Noailles, and many others, re|fu&s;ed to accept the nomination, and &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed the whole plan. When the edict for e&s;tabli&s;hing this new Court was &s;ent to the Parliaments to be enregi&s;tered, and put into execution, they re&s;i&s;ted al&s;o. The Parliament of Paris not only refu&s;ed, but denied the au|thority; and the conte&s;t renewed it&s;elf between the Parliament and the Cabinet more &s;trongly than ever. While the Parliament were &s;itting in debate on this &s;ubject, the Mini&s;try ordered a regiment of &s;oldiers to &s;urround the Hou&s;e, and form a blockade. The Members &s;ent out for beds and provi&s;ion, and lived as in a be&s;ieged citadel: and as this had no effect, the com|manding officer was ordered to enter the Parlia|ment hou&s;e and &s;eize them; which he did, and &s;ome of the principal members were &s;hut up in different pri&s;ons. About the &s;ame time a de|putation of per&s;ons arrived from the province
<PB N="104" REF="106">
of Brittany, to remon&s;trate again&s;t the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the <HI>Cour pl&eacute;niere;</HI> and tho&s;e the Arch|bi&s;hop &s;ent to the Ba&s;tille. But the &s;pirit of the Nation was not to be overcome; and it was &s;o ful|ly &s;en&s;ible of the &s;trong ground it had taken, that of withholding taxes, that it contented it&s;elf with keeping up a &s;ort of quiet re&s;i&s;tance, which effectually overthrew all the plans at that time formed again&s;t it. The project of the <HI>Cour pl&eacute;|niere</HI> was at la&s;t obliged to be given up, and the Prime Mini&s;ter not long afterwards followed its fate; and M. Neckar was recalled into office.</P>
<P>The attempt to e&s;tabli&s;h the <HI>Cour pl&eacute;niere</HI> had an effect upon the Nation which it&s;elf did not perceive. It was a &s;ort of new form of govern|ment, that in&s;en&s;ibly &s;erved to put the old one out of &s;ight, and to unhinge it from the &s;uper|&s;titious authority of antiquity. It was govern|ment dethroning government; and the old one, by attempting to make a new one, made a cha&s;m.</P>
<P>The failure of this &s;cheme renewed the &s;ubject of convening the States-General; and this gave ri&s;e to a new &s;eries of politics. There was no &s;ettled form for convening the States-General: all that it po&s;itively meant, was a deputation from what was then called the Clergy, the Noble&s;&s;e, and the Commons; but their num|bers, or their proportions, had not been always the &s;ame. They had been convened only on extraordinary occa&s;ions, the la&s;t of which was
<PB N="105" REF="107">
in 1614; their numbers were then in equal proportions, and they voted by orders.</P>
<P>It could not well e&s;cape the &s;agacity of M. Neckar, that the mode of 1614 would an&s;wer neither the purpo&s;e of the then government, nor of the nation. As matters were at that time circum&s;tanced, it would have been too contentious to agree upon any thing. The de|bates would have been endle&s;s upon privileges and exemptions, in which neither the wants of the government, nor the wi&s;hes of the nation for a con&s;titution, would have been attended to. But as he did not chu&s;e to take the deci&s;ion upon him&s;elf, he &s;ummoned again the <HI>A&s;&s;embly of the Notables,</HI> and referred it to them. This body was in general intere&s;ted in the deci&s;ion, being chiefly of the ari&s;tocracy and the high-paid clergy; and they decided in favour of the mode of 1614. This deci&s;ion was again&s;t the &s;en&s;e of the Nation, and al&s;o again&s;t the wi&s;hes of the Court; for the ari&s;tocracy oppo&s;ed it&s;elf to both, and contended for privileges inde|pendent of either. The &s;ubject was then taken up by the Parliament, who recommended, that the number of the Commons &s;hould be equal to the other two; and that they &s;hould all &s;it in one hou&s;e, and vote in one body. The num|ber finally determined on was twelve hundred: &s;ix hundred to be cho&s;en by the Commons, (and this was le&s;s than their proportion ought to have been when their worth and con&s;equence is con|&s;idered on a national &s;cale), three hundred by
<PB N="106" REF="108">
the Clergy, and three hundred by the Ari&s;to|cracy; but with re&s;pect to the mode of a&s;&s;em|bling them&s;elves, whether together or apart, or the manner in which they &s;hould vote, tho&s;e matters were referred <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Burke, (and I mu&s;t take the liberty of telling him he is very unacquainted with French affairs), &s;peaking upon this &s;ubject, &s;ays, <Q>The fir&s;t thing that &s;truck me in the calling the States-General, was a great departure from the ancient cour&s;e;</Q>&mdash; and he &s;oon after &s;ays, <Q>From the moment I read the li&s;t, I &s;aw di&s;tinctly, and very nearly as it has happened, all that was to follow.</Q>&mdash;Mr. Burke certainly did not &s;ee all that was to follow. I endeavoured to impre&s;s him, as well before as after the States-General met, that there would be a <HI>revolution;</HI> but was not able to make him &s;ee it, neither would he believe it. How then he could di&s;tinctly &s;ee all the parts, when the whole was out of &s;ight, is beyond my comprehen&s;ion. And with re&s;pect to the "departure from the ancient cour&s;e," be&s;ides the natural weak|ne&s;s of the remark, it &s;hews that he is unacquainted with circum|&s;tances. The departure was nece&s;&s;ary, from the experience had upon it, that the ancient cour&s;e was a bad one. The States-General of 1614 were called at the commencement of the civil war in the minority of Louis XIII; but by the cla&s;h of arranging them by orders, they increa&s;ed the confu&s;ion they were called to compo&s;e.

<P>The election that followed, was not a con|te&s;ted election, but an animated one. The candidates were not men, but principles. So|cieties were formed in Paris, and committees of
<PB N="107" REF="109">
corre&s;pondence and communication e&s;tabli&s;h|ed throughout the nation, for the purpo&s;e of enlightening the people, and explaining to them the principles of civil government; and &s;o or|derly was the election conducted, that it did not give ri&s;e even to the rumour of tumult.</P>
<P>The States-General were to meet at Ver|&s;ailles in April 1789, but did not a&s;&s;emble till May. They &s;ituated them&s;elves in three &s;epa|rate chambers, or rather the Clergy and the Ari&s;tocracy withdrew each into a &s;eparate cham|ber. The majority of the ari&s;tocracy claimed what they called the privilege of voting as a &s;eparate body, and of giving their con&s;ent or their negative in that manner; and many of the bi&s;hops and the high-beneficed clergy claimed the &s;ame privilege on the part of their Order.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tiers Etat</HI> (as they were then called) di&s;owned any knowledge of artificial Orders and artificial privileges; and they were not only re|&s;olute on this point, but &s;omewhat di&s;dainful. They began to con&s;ider ari&s;tocracy as a kind of fungus growing out of the corruption of &s;ociety, that could not be admitted even as a branch of it; and from the di&s;po&s;ition the ari&s;tocracy had &s;hewn by upholding Lettres de Cachet, and in &s;undry other in&s;tances, it was manife&s;t that no con&s;titution could be formed by admitting men in any other character than as National Men.</P>
<P>After various altercations on this head, the Tiers Etat or Commons (as they were then called) declared them&s;elves (on a motion made
<PB N="108" REF="110">
for that purpo&s;e by the Abb&eacute; Sieyes) "THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NATION; <HI>and that</HI>
<Q>the two Orders could be con&s;idered but as depu|ties of corporations, and could only have a de|liberative voice when they a&s;&s;embled in a national character with the national repre&s;enta|tives.</Q> This proceeding extingui&s;hed the &s;tile of <HI>Etats G&eacute;n&eacute;raux,</HI> or States-General, and erected it into the &s;tile it now bears, that of L'A&s;&s;emble Nationale, or National A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>This motion was not made in a precipitate manner: It was the re&s;ult of cool deliberation, and concerted between the national repre&s;en|tatives and the patriotic members of the two chambers, who &s;aw into the folly, mi&s;chief, and inju&s;tice of artificial privileged di&s;tinctions. It was become evident, that no con&s;titution, wor|thy of being called by that name, could be e&s;tabli&s;hed on any thing le&s;s than a national ground. The ari&s;tocracy had hitherto oppo&s;ed the de&s;poti&s;m of the Court, and affected the language of patrioti&s;m; but it oppo&s;ed it as its rival (as the Engli&s;h Barons oppo&s;ed King John), and it now oppo&s;ed the nation from the &s;ame motives.</P>
<P>On carrying this motion, the national repre|&s;entatives, as had been concerted, &s;ent an invi|tation to the two chambers, to unite with them in a national character, and proceed to bu&s;ine&s;s. A majority of the clergy, chiefly of the pari&s;h prie&s;ts, withdrew from the clerical chamber, and joined the nation; and forty-five from the
<PB N="109" REF="111">
other chamber joined in like manner. There is a &s;ort of &s;ecret hi&s;tory belonging to this la&s;t circum&s;tance, which is nece&s;&s;ary to its explana|tion: It was not judged prudent that all the pa|triotic members of the chamber &s;tiling it&s;elf the Nobles, &s;hould quit it at once; and in con|&s;equence of this arrangement, they drew off by degrees, always leaving &s;ome, as well to rea&s;on the ca&s;e, as to watch the &s;u&s;pected. In a little time, the numbers increa&s;ed from forty-five to eighty, and &s;oon after to a greater number; which, with a majority of the clergy, and the whole of the national repre&s;entatives, put the mal-contents in a very diminutive condition.</P>
<P>The King, who, very different from the gene|ral cla&s;s called by that name, is a man of a good heart, &s;hewed him&s;elf di&s;po&s;ed to recommend an union of the three chambers, on the ground the National A&s;&s;embly had taken; but the mal-contents exerted them&s;elves to prevent it, and began now to have another project in view. Their numbers con&s;i&s;ted of a majority of the ari&s;tocratical chamber, and a minority of the clerical chamber, chiefly of bi&s;hops and high-beneficed clergy; and the&s;e men were deter|mined to put every thing to i&s;&s;ue, as well by &s;trength as by &s;tratagem. They had no ob|jection to a con&s;titution; but it mu&s;t be &s;uch a one as them&s;elves &s;hould dictate, and &s;uited to their own views and particular &s;ituations. On the other hand, the Nation di&s;owned know|ing any thing of them but as citizens, and was
<PB N="110" REF="112">
determined to &s;hut out all &s;uch up-&s;tart preten|&s;ions. The more ari&s;tocracy appeared, the more it was de&s;pi&s;ed; there was a vi&s;ible imbecillity and want of intellects in the majority, a &s;ort of <HI>je ne &s;ais quoi,</HI> that while it affected to be more than citizen, was le&s;s than man. It lo&s;t ground from contempt more than from hatred; and was rather jeered at as an a&s;s, than dreaded as a lion. This is the general character of ari&s;to|cracy, or what are called Nobles or Nobility, or rather No-ability, in all countries.</P>
<P>The plan of the mal contents con&s;i&s;ted now of two things; either to deliberate and vote by chambers, (or orders), more e&s;pecially on all que&s;tions re&s;pecting a con&s;titution, (by which the ari&s;tocratical chamber would have had a ne|gative on any article of the con&s;titution); or, in ca&s;e they could not accompli&s;h this object, to overthrow the National A&s;&s;embly entirely.</P>
<P>To effect one or other of the&s;e objects, they began now to cultivate a friend&s;hip with the de&s;poti&s;m they had hitherto attempted to rival, and the Count D'Artois became their chief. The King (who has &s;ince declared him&s;elf de|ceived into their mea&s;ures) held, according to the old form, <HI>a Bed of Ju&s;tice,</HI> in which he ac|corded to the deliberation and vote <HI>par tete</HI> (by head) upon &s;everal &s;ubjects; but re&s;erved the deliberation and vote upon all que&s;tions re|&s;pecting a con&s;titution, to the three chambers &s;eparately. This declaration of the King was made again&s;t the advice of M. Neckar, who
<PB N="111" REF="113">
now began to perceive that he was growing out of fa&s;hion at Court, and that another mini|ni&s;ter was in contemplation.</P>
<P>As the form of &s;itting in &s;eparate chambers was yet apparently kept up, though e&s;&s;entially de&s;troyed, the national repre&s;entatives, imme|diately after this declaration of the King, re|&s;orted to their own chambers to con&s;ult on a prote&s;t again&s;t it; and the minority of the chamber (calling it&s;elf the Nobles), who had joined the national cau&s;e, retired to a private hou&s;e to con&s;ult in like manner. The mal|contents had by this time concerted their mea|&s;ures with the Court, which Count D'Artois undertook to conduct; and as they &s;aw from the di&s;content which the declaration excited, and the oppo&s;ition making again&s;t it, that they could not obtain a controul over the intended con&s;titution by a &s;eparate vote, they prepared them&s;elves for their final object&mdash;that of con|&s;piring again&s;t the National A&s;&s;embly, and overthrowing it.</P>
<P>The next morning, the door of the chamber of the National A&s;&s;embly was &s;hut again&s;t them, and guarded by troops; and the Mem|bers were refu&s;ed admittance. On this, they withdrew to a tennis-ground in the neighbour|hood of Ver&s;ailles, as the mo&s;t convenient place they could find, and, after renewing their &s;e&s;&s;ion, took an oath never to &s;eparate from each other, under any circum&s;tance whatever, death excepted, until they had e&s;tabli&s;hed a
<PB N="112" REF="114">
con&s;titution. As the experiment of &s;hutting up the hou&s;e had no other effect than that of pro|ducing a clo&s;er connection in the Members, it was opened again the next day, and the pub|lic bu&s;ine&s;s recommenced in the u&s;ual place.</P>
<P>We now are to have in view the forming of the new Mini&s;try, which was to accompli&s;h the overthrow of the National A&s;&s;embly. But as force would be nece&s;&s;ary, orders were i&s;&s;ued to a&s;&s;emble thirty thou&s;and troops, the command of which was given to Broglio, one of the new-intended Mini&s;try, who was recalled from the country for this purpo&s;e. But as &s;ome manage|ment was nece&s;&s;ary to keep this plan concealed till the moment it &s;hould be ready for execution, it is to this policy that a declaration made by Count D'Artois mu&s;t be attributed, and which is here proper to be introduced.</P>
<P>It could not but occur, that while the mal|contents continued to re&s;ort to their chambers &s;eparate from the National A&s;&s;embly, that more jealou&s;y would be excited than if they were mixed with it, and that the plot might be &s;u&s;|pected. But as they had taken their ground, and now wanted a pretence for quitting it, it was nece&s;&s;ary that one &s;hould be devi&s;ed. This was effectually accompli&s;hed by a declaration made by Count D'Artois, <Q>That if they took not a part in the National A&s;&s;embly, the life of the King would be endangered:</Q> on which they quitted their chambers, and mixed with the A&s;&s;embly in one body.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="115">At the time this declaration was made, it was generally treated as a piece of ab&s;urdity in Count D'Artois, and calculated merely to re|lieve the out&s;tanding Members of the two chambers from the diminutive &s;ituation they were put in; and if nothing more had followed, this conclu&s;ion would have been good. But as things be&s;t explain them&s;elves by their events, this apparent union was only a cover to the machi|nations which were &s;ecretly going on; and the declaration accommodated it&s;elf to an&s;wer that purpo&s;e. In a little time the National A&s;&s;embly found it&s;elf &s;urrounded by troops, and thou&s;ands more were daily arriving. On this a very &s;trong declaration was made by the National A&s;&s;embly to the King, remon&s;trating on the impropriety of the mea&s;ure, and demanding the rea&s;on. The King, who was not in the &s;ecret of this bu&s;ine&s;s, as him&s;elf afterwards declared, gave &s;ub&s;tantially for an&s;wer, that he had no other object in view than to pre&s;erve the public tranquillity, which appeared to be much di&s;|turbed.</P>
<P>But in a few days from this time, the plot unravelled it&s;elf. M. Neckar and the Mini&s;try were di&s;placed, and a new one formed, of the enemies of the Revolution; and Broglio, with between twenty-five and thirty thou&s;and foreign troops, was arrived to &s;upport them. The ma&s;k was now thrown off, and matters were come to a cri&s;is. The event was, that in the
<PB N="114" REF="116">
&s;pace of three days, the new Mini&s;try and their abettors found it prudent to fly the nation; the Ba&s;tille was taken, and Broglio and his foreign troops di&s;per&s;ed; as is already related in the former part of this work.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome curious circum&s;tances in the hi&s;tory of this &s;hort-lived mini&s;try, and this &s;hort-lived attempt at a counter-revolution. The palace of Ver&s;ailles, where the Court was &s;itting, was not more than four hundred yards di&s;tant from the hall where the National A&s;&s;em|bly was &s;itting. The two places were at this moment like the &s;eparate head-quarters of two combatant armies; yet the Court was as perfectly ignorant of the information which had arrived from Paris to the National A&s;&s;embly, as if it had re&s;ided at an hundred miles di&s;tance. The then Marquis de la Fayette, who (as has been already mentioned) was cho&s;en to pre|&s;ide in the National A&s;&s;embly on this particu|lar occa&s;ion, named, by order of the A&s;&s;embly, three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive deputations to the King, on the day, and up to the evening on which the Ba&s;tille was taken, to inform and confer with him on the &s;tate of affairs: but the mini&s;try, who knew not &s;o much as that it was attacked, pre|cluded all communication, and were &s;olacing them&s;elves how dextrou&s;ly they had &s;ucceeded; but in a few hours the accounts arrived &s;o thick and fa&s;t, that they had to &s;tart from their de&s;ks and run. Some &s;et off in one di&s;gui&s;e, and &s;ome
<PB N="115" REF="117">
in another, and none in their own character. Their anxiety now was to outride the news le&s;t they &s;hould be &s;topt, which, though it flew fa&s;t, flew not &s;o fa&s;t as them&s;elves.</P>
<P>It is worth remarking, that the National A&s;|&s;embly neither pur&s;ued tho&s;e fugitive con&s;pira|tors, nor took any notice of them, nor &s;ought to retaliate in any &s;hape whatever. Occupied with e&s;tabli&s;hing a con&s;titution founded on the Rights of Man and the Authority of the People, the only authority on which Government has a right to exi&s;t in any country, the National A&s;|&s;embly felt none of tho&s;e mean pa&s;&s;ions which mark the character of impertinent governments, founding them&s;elves on their own authority, or on the ab&s;urdity of hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. It is the faculty of the human mind to become what it contemplates, and to act in uni&s;on with its object.</P>
<P>The con&s;piracy being thus di&s;per&s;ed, one of the fir&s;t works of the National A&s;&s;embly, in&s;tead of vindictive proclamations, as has been the ca&s;e with other governments, publi&s;hed a Declaration of the Rights of Man, as the ba&s;is on which the new con&s;titution was to be built, and which is here &s;ubjoined:</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="declaration">
<HEAD>DECLARATION OF THE RIGHTS OF MAN AND OF CITIZENS, <HI>By the National A&s;&s;embly of France.</HI></HEAD>
<P>"THE Repre&s;entatives of the people of FRANCE, formed into a NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, con&s;idering that ignorance, neglect, or contempt of human rights, are the &s;ole cau&s;es of public misfortunes and corruptions of Government, have re&s;olved to &s;et forth, in a &s;olemn declara|tion, the&s;e natural, impre&s;criptible, and unalie|nable rights: that this declaration being con|&s;tantly pre&s;ent to the minds of the members of the body &s;ocial, they may be ever kept attentive to their rights and their duties: that the acts of the legi&s;lative and executive powers of Govern|ment, being capable of being every moment compared with the end of political in&s;titutions, may be more re&s;pected: and al&s;o, that the future claims of the citizens, being directed by &s;imple and inconte&s;tible principles, may always tend to the maintenance of the Con&s;titution, and the general happine&s;s.</P>
<P>"For the&s;e rea&s;ons, the NATIONAL ASSEMBLY doth recognize and declare, in the pre&s;ence of the Supreme Being, and with the hope of his ble&s;&s;ing and favour, the following <HI>&s;acred</HI> rights of men and of citizens:</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="117" REF="119"><Q><HI>I.</HI> Men are born, and always continue, free, and equal in re&s;pect of their rights. Civil di&s;|tinctions, therefore, can be founded only on public utility.</Q></P>
<P N="2"><Q><HI>II.</HI> The end of all political a&s;&s;ociations, is, the pre&s;ervation of the natural and impre&s;criptible rights of man; and the&s;e rights are liberty, pro|perty, &s;ecurity, and re&s;i&s;tance of oppre&s;&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P N="3"><Q><HI>III.</HI> The nation is e&s;&s;entially the &s;ource of all &s;overeignty; nor can any <HI>INDIVIDUAL,</HI> or <HI>ANY BODY OF MEN,</HI> be entitled to any authority which is not expre&s;sly derived from it.</Q></P>
<P N="4"><Q>IV. Political Liberty con&s;i&s;ts in the power of doing whatever does not injure another. The exerci&s;e of the natural rights of every man, has no other limits than tho&s;e which are nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure to every <HI>other</HI> man the free exerci&s;e of the &s;ame rights; and the&s;e limits are determinable only by the law.</Q></P>
<P N="5"><Q>V. The law ought to prohibit only actions hurtful to &s;ociety. What is not prohibited by the law, &s;hould not be hindered; nor &s;hould any one be compelled to that which the law does not require.</Q></P>
<P N="6"><Q>VI. The law is an expre&s;&s;ion of the will of the community. All citizens have a right to concur, either per&s;onally, or by their repre|&s;entatives, in its formation. It &s;hould be the &s;ame to all, whether it protects or puni&s;hes; and <HI>all being equal in its &s;ight, are equally eli|gible to all honours, places, and employments,
<PB N="118" REF="120">
according to their different abilities, without any other di&s;tinction than that created by their virtues and talents.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="7"><Q>VII. No man &s;hould be accu&s;ed, arre&s;ted, or held in confinement, except in ca&s;es deter|mined by the law, and according to the forms which it has pre&s;cribed. All who promote, &s;olicit, execute, or cau&s;e to be executed, arbitrary orders, ought to be puni&s;hed; and every citizen called upon, or apprehended by virtue of the law, ought immediately to obey, and renders him&s;elf culpable by re&s;i&s;tance.</Q></P>
<P N="8"><Q>VIII. The law ought to impo&s;e no other penalties but &s;uch as are ab&s;olutely and evi|dently nece&s;&s;ary: and no one ought to be pu|ni&s;hed, but in virtue of a law promulgated before the offence, and legally applied.</Q></P>
<P N="9"><Q>IX. Every man being pre&s;umed innocent till he has been convicted, whenever his de|tention becomes indi&s;pen&s;ible, all rigour to him, more than is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure his per|&s;on, ought to be provided again&s;t by the law.</Q></P>
<P N="10"><Q>X. No man ought to be mole&s;ted on account of his opinions, not even on account of his <HI>re|ligious</HI> opinions, provided his avowal of them does not di&s;turb the public order e&s;tabli&s;hed by the law.</Q></P>
<P N="11"><Q>XI. The unre&s;trained communication of thoughts and opinions being one of the mo&s;t precious rights of man, every citizen may &s;peak, write, and publi&s;h freely, provided he
<PB N="119" REF="121">
is re&s;pon&s;ible for the abu&s;e of this liberty in ca&s;es determined by the law.</Q></P>
<P N="12"><Q>XII. A public force being nece&s;&s;ary to give &s;ecurity to the rights of men and of citi|zens, that force is in&s;tituted for the benefit of the community, and not for the particular benefit of the per&s;ons with whom it is en|tru&s;ted.</Q></P>
<P N="13"><Q>XIII. A common contribution being ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of the public force, and for defraying the other expences of go|vernment, it ought to be divided equally among the members of the community, ac|cording to their abilities.</Q></P>
<P N="14"><Q>XIV. Every citizen has a right, either by him&s;elf or his repre&s;entative, to a free voice in determining the nece&s;&s;ity of public contri|butions, the appropriation of them, and their amount, mode of a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment, and duration.</Q></P>
<P N="15"><Q>XV. Every community has a right to de|mand of all its agents, an account of their conduct.</Q></P>
<P N="16"><Q>XVI. Every community in which a &s;epa|ration of powers and a &s;ecurity of rights is not provided for, wants a con&s;titution.</Q></P>
<P N="17"><Q>XVII. The right to property being invio|lable and &s;acred, no one ought to be deprived of it, except in ca&s;es of evident public nece&s;|&s;ity, legally a&s;certained, and on condition of a previous ju&s;t indemnity.</Q></P>

<HEAD>OSBERVATIONS ON THE DECLARATION OF RIGHTS.</HEAD>
<P>THE three fir&s;t articles comprehend in gene|ral terms, the whole of a Declaration of Rights: All the &s;ucceeding articles either originate from them, or follow as elucidations. The 4th, 5th, and 6th, define more particularly what is only generally expre&s;&s;ed in the 1&s;t, 2d, and 3d.</P>
<P>The 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th articles, are declaratory of <HI>principles</HI> upon which laws &s;hall be con&s;tructed, conformable to <HI>rights</HI> al|ready declared. But it is que&s;tioned by &s;ome very good people in France, as well as in other countries, whether the 10th article &s;ufficiently guarantees the right it is intended to accord with: be&s;ides which, it takes off from the di|vine dignity of religion, and weakens its opera|tive force upon the mind, to make it a &s;ubject of human laws. It then pre&s;ents it&s;elf to Man, like light intercepted by a cloudy medium, in which the &s;ource of it is ob&s;cured from his &s;ight, and he &s;ees nothing to reverence in the du&s;ky ray <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is a &s;ingle idea, which, if it &s;trikes rightly upon the mind either in a legal or a religious &s;en&s;e, will prevent any man, or any body of men, or any government, from going wrong on the &s;ubject of Religion; which is, that before any human in&s;titu|tions of government was known in the world, there exi&s;ted, if I may &s;o expre&s;s it, a compact between God and Man, from the be|ginning of time; and that as the relation and condition which man in his <HI>individual per&s;on</HI> &s;tands in towards his Maker, cannot be changed, or any-ways altered by any human laws or human authority, that religious devotion, which is a part of this com|pact, cannot &s;o much as be made a &s;ubject of human laws; and that all laws mu&s;t conform them&s;elves to this prior exi&s;ting com|pact, and not a&s;&s;ume to make the compact conform to the laws, which, be&s;ides being human, are &s;ub&s;equent thereto. The fir&s;t act of man, when he looked around and &s;aw him&s;elf a creature which he did not make, and a world furni&s;hed for his reception, mu&s;t have been devotion, and devotion mu&s;t ever continue &s;acred to every individual man, <HI>as it appears right to him;</HI> and govern|ments do mi&s;chief by interfering.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="123">The remaining articles, beginning with the twelfth, are &s;ub&s;tantially contained in the prin|ciples of the preceding articles; but, in the particular &s;ituation which France then was, having to undo what was wrong, as well as to &s;et up what was right, it was proper to be more particular than what in another condition of things would be nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>While the Declaration of Rights was before the National A&s;&s;embly, &s;ome of its members remarked, that if a Declaration of Rights was publi&s;hed, it &s;hould be accompanied by a De|claration of Duties. The ob&s;ervation di&s;covered a mind that reflected, and it only erred by not reflecting far enough. A Declaration of Rights is, by reciprocity, a Declaration of Duties al&s;o. Whatever is my right as a man, is al&s;o the right of another; and it becomes my duty to guarantee, as well as to po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="124">The three fir&s;t articles are the ba&s;is of Liber|ty, as well individual as national; nor can any country be called free, who&s;e government does not take its beginning from the principles they contain, and continue to pre&s;erve them pure; and the whole of the Declaration of Rights is of more value to the world, and will do more good, than all the laws and &s;tatutes that have yet been promulgated.</P>
<P>In the declaratory exordium which prefaces the Declaration of Rights, we &s;ee the &s;olemn and maje&s;tic &s;pectacle of a Nation opening its commi&s;&s;ion, under the au&s;pices of its Creator, to e&s;tabli&s;h a Government; a &s;cene &s;o new, and &s;o tran&s;cendantly unequalled by any-thing in the European world, that the name of a Revo|lution is diminutive of its character, and it ri&s;es into a Regeneration of man. What are the pre&s;ent Governments of Europe, but a &s;cene of iniquity and oppre&s;&s;ion? What is that of England? Do not its own inhabitants &s;ay, It is a market where every man has his price, and where corruption is common traffic, at the expence of a deluded people? No wonder, then, that the French Revolution is traduced. Had it confined it&s;elf merely to the de&s;truction of flagrant de&s;poti&s;m, perhaps Mr. Burke and &s;ome others had been &s;ilent. Their cry now is, "It is gone too far:" that is, it has gone too far for them. It &s;tares corruption in the face, and the venal tribe are all alarmed. Their fear
<PB N="123" REF="125">
di&s;covers it&s;elf in their outrage, and they are but publi&s;hing the groans of a wounded vice. But from &s;uch oppo&s;ition, the French Revolu|tion, in&s;tead of &s;uffering, receives an homage. The more it is &s;truck, the more &s;parks it will emit; and the fear is, it will not be &s;truck enough. It has nothing to dread from attacks: Truth has given it an e&s;tabli&s;hment; and Time will record it with a name as la&s;ting as his own.</P>

<HEAD>MISCELLANEOUS CHAPTER.</HEAD>
<P>TO prevent interrupting the argument in the preceding part of this work, or the narrative that follows it, I re&s;erved &s;ome ob&s;erva|tions to be thrown together into a Mi&s;cella|neous Chapter; by which variety might not be cen&s;ured for confu&s;ion. Mr. Burke's Book is <HI>all</HI> Mi&s;cellany. His intention was to make an attack on the French Revolution; but in&s;tead of proceeding with an orderly arrangement, he has &s;tormed it with a mob of ideas tumbling over and de&s;troying one another.</P>
<P>But this confu&s;ion and contradiction in Mr. Burke's Book is ea&s;ily accounted for.&mdash;When a man in a long cau&s;e attempts to &s;teer his cour&s;e by any thing el&s;e than &s;ome polar truth or principle, he is &s;ure to be lo&s;t.

Neither memory nor invention will &s;upply the want of it. The for|mer fails him, and the latter betrays him.</P>

Government is. <Q>Government, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> is a contrivance of human wi&s;dom.</Q></P>
<P>Admitting that Government is a contrivance of human <HI>wi&s;dom,</HI> it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily follow, that hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and hereditary rights, (as they are called), can make no part of it, becau&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible to make wi&s;dom heredi|tary; and on the other hand, <HI>that</HI> cannot be a wi&s;e contrivance, which in its operation may commit the government of a nation to the wi&s;|dom of an ideot. The ground which Mr. Burke now takes, is fatal to every part of his cau&s;e. The argument changes from hereditary rights to hereditary wi&s;dom; and the que&s;tion is, Who is the wi&s;e&s;t man? He mu&s;t now &s;hew that every one in the line of hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was a Solomon, or his title is not good to be a king.&mdash;What a &s;troke has Mr. Burke now made! To u&s;e a &s;ailors phra&s;e, he has <HI>&s;wabbed the deck,</HI> and &s;carcely left a name legible in the li&s;t of kings; and he has mowed down and thinned the Hou&s;e of Peers, with a &s;cythe as formidable as Death and Time.</P>
<P>But Mr. Burke appears to have been aware of this retort; and he has taken care to guard again&s;t it, by making government to be not only a <HI>contrivance</HI> of human wi&s;dom, but a <HI>mo|nopoly</HI> of wi&s;dom. He puts the nation as fools on one &s;ide, and places his government of wi&s;dom, all wi&s;e men of Gotham, on the other &s;ide; and he then proclaims, and &s;ays, that <Q>Men have a <HI>RIGHT</HI> that their <HI>WANTS</HI> &s;hould
<PB N="126" REF="128">
be provided for by this wi&s;dom.</Q> Having thus made proclamation, he next proceeds to explain to them what their <HI>wants</HI> are, and al&s;o what their <HI>rights</HI> are. In this he has &s;ucceeded dextrou&s;ly, for he makes their wants to be a <HI>want</HI> of wi&s;dom; but as this is but cold com|fort, he then informs them, that they have a <HI>right</HI> (not to any of the wi&s;dom) but to be go|verned by it: and in order to impre&s;s them with a &s;olemn reverence for this monopoly-government of wi&s;dom, and of its va&s;t capacity for all purpo&s;es, po&s;&s;ible or impo&s;&s;ible, right or wrong, he proceeds with a&s;trological my&s;teri|ous importance, to tell to them its powers, in the&s;e words&mdash;<Q>The Rights of men in govern|ment are their advantages; and the&s;e are often in balances between differences of good; and in compromi&s;es &s;ometimes be|tween <HI>good</HI> and <HI>evil,</HI> and &s;ometimes between <HI>evil</HI> and <HI>evil</HI> Political rea&s;on is a <HI>computing principle;</HI> adding&mdash;&s;ubtracting&mdash;multiplying &mdash;and dividing, morally, and not metaphy|&s;ically or mathematically, true moral demon|&s;trations.</Q></P>
<P>As the wondering audience, whom Mr. Burke &s;uppo&s;es him&s;elf talking to, may not under|&s;tand all this learned jargon, I will undertake to be its interpreter. The meaning then, good people, of all this, is, <HI>That government is govern|ed by no principle whatever; that it can make evil good, or good evil, ju&s;t as it plea&s;es. In &s;hort, that government is arbitrary power.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="129">But there are &s;ome things which Mr. Burke has forgotten. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> He has not &s;hewn where the wi&s;dom originally came from: and <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> he has not &s;hewn by what authority it fir&s;t began to act. In the manner he introduces the matter, it is either government &s;tealing wi&s;dom, or wi&s;dom &s;tealing government. It is without an origin, and its powers without authority. In &s;hort, it is u&s;urpation.</P>
<P>Whether it be from a &s;en&s;e of &s;hame, or from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;ome radical defect in a government nece&s;&s;ary to be kept out of &s;ight, or from both, or from any other cau&s;e, I under|take not to determine; but &s;o it is, that a monarchical rea&s;oner never traces government to its &s;ource, or from its &s;ource. It is one of the <HI>&s;hibboleths</HI> by which he may be known. A a thou&s;and years hence, tho&s;e who &s;hall live in America or in France, will look back with contemplative pride on the origin of their go|vernments, and &s;ay, <HI>This was the work of our glorious ance&s;tors!</HI> But what can a monarchical talker &s;ay? What has he to exult in? Alas! he has nothing. A certain &s;omething forbids him to look back to a beginning, le&s;t &s;ome robber or &s;ome Robin Hood &s;hould ri&s;e from the long ob&s;curity of time, and &s;ay, <HI>I am the origin!</HI> Hard as Mr. Burke laboured the Regency Bill and hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion two years ago, and much as he dived for precedents, he &s;till had not boldne&s;s enough to bring up William of Normandy, and &s;ay, <HI>There is the head of the
<PB N="128" REF="130">
li&s;t! there is the fountain of honour!</HI> the &s;on of a pro&s;titutc, and the plunderer of the Engli&s;h nation.</P>
<P>The opinions of men with re&s;pect to govern|ment, are changing fa&s;t in all countries. The revolutions of America and France have thrown a beam of light over the world, which reaches into man. The enormous expence of govern|ments have provoked people to think, by mak|ing them feel: and when once the veil begins to rend, it admits not of repair. Ignorance is of a peculiar nature: once di&s;pelled, and it is impo&s;&s;ible to re-e&s;tabli&s;h it. It is not originally a thing of it&s;elf, but is only the ab&s;ence of knowledge; and though man may be <HI>kept</HI> igno|rant, he cannot be <HI>made</HI> ignorant. The mind, in di&s;covering truth, acts in the &s;ame manner as it acts through the eye in di&s;covering objects; when once any object has been &s;een, it is impo&s;&s;i|ble to put the mind back to the &s;ame condition it was in before it &s;aw it. Tho&s;e who talk of a counter revolution in France, &s;hew how little they under|&s;tand of man. There does not exi&s;t in the com|pa&s;s of language, an arrangement of words to expre&s;s &s;o much as the means of effecting a counter revolution. The means mu&s;t be an obliteration of knowledge; and it has never yet been di&s;covered, how to make man <HI>unknow</HI> his knowledge, or <HI>unthink</HI> his thoughts.</P>
<P>Mr Burke is labouring in vain to &s;top the pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gre&s;s of knowledge; and it comes with the wor&s;e grace from him, as there is a certain tran&s;|action
<PB N="129" REF="131">
known in the city, which renders him &s;u&s;pected of being a pen&s;ioner in a fictitious name. This may account for &s;ome &s;trange doctrine he has advanced in his book, which, though he points it at the Revolution Society, is effectually directed again&s;t the whole Nation.</P>
<P>"The King of England," &s;ays he, <Q>holds <HI>his</HI> Crown (for it does not belong to the Nation, according to Mr. Burke) in <HI>contempt</HI> of the choice of the Revolution Society, who have not a &s;ingle vote for a King among them either <HI>individually</HI> or <HI>collectively;</HI> and his Maje&s;ty's heirs, each in their time and order, will come to the Crown <HI>with the &s;ame con|tempt</HI> of their choice, with which his Maje&s;ty has &s;ucceeded to that which he now wears.</Q></P>
<P>As to who is King in England or el&s;ewhere, or whether there is any King at all, or whether the people chu&s;e a Cherokee Chief, or a He&s;&s;ian Hu&s;&s;ar for a King, it is not a matter that I trouble my&s;elf about&mdash;be that to them&s;elves; but with re&s;pect to the doctrine, &s;o far as it re|lates to the Rights of Men and Nations, it is as abominable as any thing ever uttered in the mo&s;t en&s;laved country under heaven. Whether it &s;ounds wor&s;e to my ear, by not being accu&s;|tomed to hear &s;uch de&s;poti&s;m, than what it does to the ear of another per&s;on, I am not &s;o well a judge of; but of its abominable principle I am at no lo&s;s to judge.</P>
<P>It is not the Revolution Society that Mr. Burke means; it is the Nation, as well in its
<PB N="130" REF="132">
<HI>original,</HI> as in its <HI>repre&s;entative</HI> character; and he has taken care to make him&s;elf under&s;tood, by &s;aying that they have not a vote either <HI>col|lectively</HI> or <HI>individually.</HI> The Revolution So|ciety is compo&s;ed of citizens of all denomina|tions, and of members of both the Hou&s;es of Parliament; and con&s;equently, if there is not a right to a vote in any of the characters, there can be no right to any, either in the nation, or in its parliament. This ought to be a caution to every country, how it imports foreign families to be kings. It is &s;omewhat curious to ob&s;erve, that although the people of England have been in the habit of talking about kings, it is always a Foreign Hou&s;e of kings; hating Foreigners, yet governed by them.&mdash;It is now the Hou&s;e of Brun&s;wick, one of the petty tribes of Germany.</P>
<P>It has hitherto been the practice of the Engli&s;h Parliaments, to regulate what was called the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, (taking it for granted, that the Nation then continued to accord to the form of annex|ing a monarchical branch to its government; for without this, the Parliament could not have had authority to have &s;ent either to Holland or to Hanover, or to impo&s;e a King upon the Na|tion again&s;t its will.) And this mu&s;t be the ut|mo&s;t limit to which Parliament can go upon the ca&s;e; but the right of the Nation goes to the <HI>whole</HI> ca&s;e, becau&s;e it has the right of changing its <HI>whole</HI> form of government. The right of a Parliament is only a right in tru&s;t, a right by delegation, and that but from a very &s;mall part
<PB N="131" REF="133">
of the Nation; and one of its Hou&s;es has not even this. But the right of the Nation is an original right, as univer&s;al as taxation. The Nation is the payma&s;ter of every thing, and every thing mu&s;t conform to its general will.</P>
<P>I remember taking notice of a &s;peech in what is called the Engli&s;h Hou&s;e of Peers, by the then Earl of Shelburne, and I think it was at the time he was Mini&s;ter, which is applicable to this ca&s;e. I do not directly charge my memory with every particular; but the words and the purport, as nearly as I remember, were the&s;e: <HI>That the form of a Government was a matter wholly at the will of a Nation, at all times: that if it cho&s;e a monarchi|cal form, it had a right to have it &s;o; and if it afterwards cho&s;e to be a Republic, it had a right to be a Republic, and to &s;ay to a King, 'We have no longer any occa&s;ion for you.'</HI></P>
<P>When Mr. Burke &s;ays that <Q>His Maje&s;ty's heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, each in their time and order, will come to the crown with the <HI>&s;ame contempt</HI> of their choice with which His Ma|je&s;ty has &s;ucceeded to that he wears,</Q> it is &s;aying too much even to the humble&s;t individual in the country; part of who&s;e daily labour goes towards making up the million &s;terling a year, which the country gives the per&s;on it &s;tiles a King. Government with in&s;olence, is de&s;poti&s;m; but when contempt is added, it becomes wor&s;e; and to pay for contempt, is the exce&s;s of &s;lavery. This &s;pecies of Government comes from Ger|many; and reminds me of what one of the
<PB N="132" REF="134">
Brun&s;wick &s;oldiers told me, who was taken pri|&s;oner by the Americans in the late war: "Ah!" &s;aid he, <Q>America is a fine free country, it is worth the people's fighting for; I know the difference by knowing my own: in my coun|try, if the prince &s;ays, Eat &s;traw, we eat &s;traw.</Q> God help that country, thought I, be it Eng|land or el&s;ewhere, who&s;e liberties are to be pro|tected by German principles of government, and Princes of Brun&s;wick!</P>
<P>As Mr. Burke &s;ometimes &s;peaks of England, &s;ometimes of France, and &s;ometimes of the world, and of government in general, it is difficult to an&s;wer his book without apparently meeting him on the &s;ame ground. Although principles of Government are general &s;ubjects, it is next to impo&s;&s;ible in many ca&s;es to &s;eparate them from the idea of place and circum&s;tance; and the more &s;o when circum&s;tances are put for arguments, which is frequently the ca&s;e with Mr. Burke.</P>
<P>In the former part of his book, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the people of France, he &s;ays, <Q>No experience has taught us, (meaning the Eng|li&s;h), that in any other cour&s;e or method than that of an <HI>hereditary crown,</HI> can our liberties be regularly perpetuated and pre&s;erved &s;acred as our <HI>hereditary right.</HI></Q> I a&s;k Mr. Burke, who is to take them away?&mdash;M. de la Fayette, in &s;peaking to France, &s;ays, <Q>For a Nation to be free, it is &s;ufficient that &s;he wills it.</Q> But Mr. Burke repre&s;ents England as wanting capa|city to take care of it&s;elf, and that its liberties
<PB N="133" REF="135">
mu&s;t be taken care of by a King holding it in "contempt." If England is &s;unk to this, it is preparing it&s;elf to eat &s;traw, as in Hanover or in Brun&s;wick. But be&s;ides the folly of the de|claration, it happens that the facts are all again&s;t Mr. Burke. It was by the Government <HI>being hereditary,</HI> that the liberties of the people were endangered. Charles I. and James II. are in|&s;tances of this truth; yet neither of them went &s;o far as to hold the Nation in contempt.</P>
<P>As it is &s;ometimes of advantage to the people of one country, to hear what tho&s;e of other countries have to &s;ay re&s;pecting it, it is po&s;&s;ible that the people of France may learn &s;omething from Mr. Burke's book, and that the people of England may al&s;o learn &s;omething from the an|&s;wers it will occa&s;ion. When Nations fall out about freedom, a wide field of debate is opened. The argument commences with the rights of war. without its evils; and as knowledge is the object contended for, the party that &s;u&s;tains the defeat obtains the prize.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke talks about what he calls an here|ditary crown, as if it were &s;ome production of Nature; or as if, like Time, it had a power to operate, not only independently, but in &s;pite of man; or as if it were a thing or a &s;ubject uni|ver&s;ally con&s;ented to. Alas! it has none of tho&s;e properties, but is the rever&s;e of them all. It is a thing in imagination, the propriety of which is more than doubted, and the legality of which in a few years will be denied.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="136">But, to arrange this matter in a clearer view than what general expre&s;&s;ions can convey, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tate the di&s;tinct heads under which (what is called) an hereditary crown, or, more properly &s;peaking, an hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the Government of a Nation, can be con&s;i|dered; which are,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, The right of a particular Family to e&s;tabli&s;h it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Secondly, The right of a Nation to e&s;tabli&s;h a particular Family.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of the&s;e heads, that of a Family e&s;tabli&s;hing it&s;elf with hereditary powers on its own authority, and independent of the con&s;ent of a Nation, all men will concur in calling it de&s;poti&s;m; and it would be tre&s;pa&s;&s;|ing on their under&s;tanding to attempt to prove it.</P>
<P>But the <HI>&s;econd</HI> head, that of a Nation e&s;tabli&s;h|ing a particular Family with <HI>hereditary powers,</HI> does not pre&s;ent it&s;elf as de&s;poti&s;m on the fir&s;t reflection; but if men will permit a &s;econd re|flection to take place, and carry that reflection forward but one remove out of their own per|&s;ons to that of their offspring, they will then &s;ee that hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion becomes in its con&s;e|quences the &s;ame de&s;poti&s;m to others, which they reprobated for them&s;elves. It operates to preclude the con&s;ent of the &s;ucceeding genera|tion; and the preclu&s;ion of con&s;ent is de&s;poti&s;m. When the per&s;on who at any time &s;hall be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a Government, or tho&s;e who &s;tand in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to him, &s;hall &s;ay to a Nation, I
<PB N="135" REF="137">
hold this power in 'contempt' of you, it &s;ignifies not on what authority he pretends to &s;ay it. It is no relief, but an aggravation to a per&s;on in &s;lavery, to reflect that he was &s;old by his parent; and as that which heightens the criminality of an act cannot be produced to prove the legality of it, hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion cannot be e&s;tabli&s;hed as a legal thing.</P>
<P>In order to arrive at a more perfect deci&s;ion on this head, it will be proper to con&s;ider the gene|ration which undertakes to e&s;tabli&s;h a Family with <HI>hereditary powers,</HI> a-part and &s;eparate from the generations which are to follow; and al&s;o to con|&s;ider the character in which the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> generation acts with re&s;pect to &s;ucceeding generations.</P>
<P>The generation which fir&s;t &s;elects a per&s;on, and puts him at the head of its Government, either with the title of King, or any other di&s;tinction, acts its <HI>own choice,</HI> be it wi&s;e or fooli&s;h, as a free agent for it&s;elf. The per&s;on &s;o &s;et up is not hereditary, but &s;elected and appointed; and the generation who &s;ets him up, does not live under an hereditary go|vernment, but under a government of its own choice and e&s;tabli&s;hment. Were the generation who &s;ets him up, and the per&s;on &s;o &s;et up, to live for ever, it never could become hereditary &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion; and of con&s;equence, hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion can only follow on the death of the fir&s;t parties.</P>
<P>As therefore hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is out of the que&s;tion with re&s;pect to the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> generation, we have now to con&s;ider the character in which <HI>that</HI> generation acts with re&s;pect to the commencing generation, and to all &s;ucceeding ones.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="138">It a&s;&s;umes a character, to which it has neither right nor title. It changes it&s;elf from a <HI>Legi&s;lator</HI> to a <HI>Te&s;tator,</HI> and affects to make its Will, which is to have operation after the demi&s;e of the makers, to bequeath the Government; and it not only attempts to bequeath, but to e&s;tabli&s;h on the &s;uc|ceeding generation, a new and different form of government under which it&s;elf lived. It&s;elf, as is already ob&s;erved, lived not under an hereditary Government, but under a Government of its own choice and e&s;tabli&s;hment; and it now attempts, by virtue of a will and te&s;tament, (and which it has not authority to make), to take from the com|mencing generation, and all future ones, the rights and free agency by which it&s;elf acted.</P>
<P>But, exclu&s;ive of the right which any generation has to act collectively as a te&s;tator, the objects to which it applies it&s;elf in this ca&s;e, are not within the compa&s;s of any law, or of any will or te&s;tament.</P>
<P>The rights of men in &s;ociety, are neither devi&s;e|able, nor transferable, nor annihilable, but are de&s;cendable only; and it is not in the power of any generation to intercept finally, and cut off the de&s;cent. If the pre&s;ent generation, or any other, are di&s;po&s;ed to be &s;laves, it does not le&s;&s;en the right of the &s;ucceeding generation to be free: wrongs cannot have a legal de&s;cent. When Mr. Burke attempts to maintain, that the <HI>Engli&s;h Nation did at the Revolution of</HI> 1688, <HI>mo&s;t &s;olemnly renounce and abdicate their rights for them&s;elves, and for all their po&s;terity for ever;</HI> he &s;peaks a language that merits not reply, and which can only excite contempt for his pro&s;titute principles, or pity for his ignorance.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="139">In whatever light hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, as grow|ing out of the will and te&s;tament of &s;ome former generation, pre&s;ents it&s;elf, it is an ab&s;urdity.

A certain former generation made a will, to take away the rights of the commencing gene|ration, and all future ones, and convey tho&s;e rights to a third per&s;on, who afterwards comes forward, and tells them, in Mr. Burke's language, that they have <HI>no rights,</HI> that their rights are already be|queathed to him, and that he will govern in <HI>con|tempt</HI> of them. From &s;uch principles, and &s;uch ignorance, Good Lord deliver the world!</P>
<P>But, after all, what is this metaphor called a crown, or rather what is monarchy? Is it a thing, or is it a name, or is it a fraud? Is it "a contrivance of human wi&s;dom," or of human craft to obtain money from a nation under &s;pe|cious pretences? Is it a thing nece&s;&s;ary to a nation? If it is, in what does that nece&s;&s;ity con&s;i&s;t, what &s;ervices does it perform, what is its bu&s;ine&s;s, and what are its merits? Doth the vir|tue con&s;i&s;t in the metaphor, or in the man? Doth the gold&s;mith that makes the crown, make the vir|tue al&s;o? Doth it operate like Fortunatus's wi&s;h|ing-cap, or Harlequin's wooden &s;word? Doth it make a man a conjuror? In fine, what is it? It appears to be a &s;omething going much out of fa&s;hion, falling into ridicule, and rejected in &s;ome countries both as unnece&s;&s;ary and expen&s;ive. In

America it is con&s;idered as an ab&s;urdity; and in France it has &s;o far declined, that the goodne&s;s of the man, and the re&s;pect for his per&s;onal cha|racter, are the only things that pre&s;erve the ap|pearance of its exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>If Government be what Mr. Burke de&s;cribes it, "a contrivance of human wi&s;dom," I might a&s;k him, if wi&s;dom was at &s;uch a low ebb in Eng|land, that it was become nece&s;&s;ary to import it from Holland and from Hanover? But I will do the country the ju&s;tice to &s;ay, that was not the ca&s;e; and even if it was, it mi&s;took the cargo. The wi&s;dom of every country, when properly exerted, is &s;ufficient for all its purpo&s;es; and there could exi&s;t no more real occa&s;ion in England to have &s;ent for a Dutch Stadtholder, or a German Elector, than there was in America to have done a &s;imilar thing. If a country does not under&s;tand its own affairs, how is a foreigner to under&s;tand them, who knows neither its laws, its manners, nor its language? If there exi&s;ted a man &s;o tran&s;cen|dantly wi&s;e above all others, that his wi&s;dom was nece&s;&s;ary to in&s;truct a nation, &s;ome rea&s;on might be offered for monarchy; but when we ca&s;t our eyes about a country, and ob&s;erve how every part under&s;tands its own affairs; and when we look around the world, and &s;ee that of all men in it, the race of kings are the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant in capacity, our rea&s;on cannot fail to a&s;k us&mdash;What are tho&s;e men kept for?</P>
<P>If there is any thing in monarchy which we people of America do not under&s;tand, I wi&s;h Mr.

<P>It is ea&s;y to conceive, that a band of intere&s;ted men, &s;uch as Placemen, Pen&s;ioners, Lords of the bed-chamber, Lords of the kitchen, Lords of the nece&s;&s;ary-hou&s;e, and the Lord knows what be&s;ides, can find as many rea&s;ons for monarchy as their
<PB N="140" REF="142">
&s;alaries, paid at the expence of the country, amount to; but if I a&s;k the farmer, the manufac|turer, the merchant, the trade&s;man, and down through all the occupations of life to the common labourer, what &s;ervice monarchy is to him? he can give me no an&s;wer. If I a&s;k him what mo|narchy is, he believes it is &s;omething like a &s;inecure.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the taxes of England amount to almo&s;t &s;eventeen millions a-year, &s;aid to be for the expences of Government, it is &s;till evident that the &s;en&s;e of the Nation is left to govern it&s;elf, and does govern it&s;elf by magi&s;trates and juries, almo&s;t at its own charge, on republican principles, exclu&s;ive of the expence of taxes. The &s;alaries of the Judges are almo&s;t the only charge that is paid out of the revenue. Con&s;idering that all the internal Government is executed by the people, the taxes of England ought to be the lighte&s;t of any nation in Europe; in&s;tead of which, they are the contrary. As this cannot be accounted for on the &s;core of civil government, the &s;ubject nece&s;&s;a|rily extends it&s;elf to the monarchical part.</P>
<P>When the people of England &s;ent for George the Fir&s;t, (and it would puzzle a wi&s;er man than Mr. Burke to di&s;cover for what he could be wanted, or what &s;ervice he could render), they ought at lea&s;t to have conditioned for the aban|donment of Hanover. Be&s;ides the endle&s;s Ger|man intrigues that mu&s;t follow from a German Elector being King of England, there is a natural impo&s;&s;ibility of uniting in the &s;ame per&s;on the principles of Freedom and the principles of
<PB N="141" REF="143">
De&s;poti&s;m, or, as it is u&s;ually called in England, Arbitrary Power. A German Elector is in his electorate a de&s;pot: How then could it be ex|pected that he &s;hould be attached to principles of liberty in one country, while his intere&s;t in another was to be &s;upported by de&s;poti&s;m? The union cannot exi&s;t; and it might ea&s;ily have been fore&s;een, that German Electors would make Ger|man Kings, or, in Mr. Burke's words, would a&s;&s;ume government with 'contempt.' The Engli&s;h have been in the habit of con&s;idering a King of England only in the character in which he appears to them: whereas the &s;ame per&s;on, while the connection la&s;ts, has a home-&s;eat in another coun|try, the intere&s;t of which is different to their own, and the principles of the governments in oppo&s;ition to each other&mdash;To &s;uch a per&s;on England will appear as a town-re&s;idence, and the Electorate as the e&s;tate. The Engli&s;h may wi&s;h, as I believe they do, &s;ucce&s;s to the principles of Liberty in France, or in Germany; but a German Elector trembles for the fate of de&s;poti&s;m in his electorate: and the Dutchy of Mecklenburgh, where the pre&s;ent Queen's family governs, is under the &s;ame wretched &s;tate of arbitrary power, and the people in &s;lavi&s;h va&s;&s;alage.</P>
<P>There never was a time when it became the Engli&s;h to watch continental intrigues more cir|cum&s;pectly than at the pre&s;ent moment, and to di&s;tingui&s;h the politics of the Electorate from the politics of the Nation. The revolution of France has entirely changed the ground with re&s;pect to
<PB N="142" REF="144">
England and France, as nations: but the German de&s;pots, with Pru&s;&s;ia at their head, are combin|ing again&s;t Liberty; and the fondne&s;s of Mr. Pitt for office, and the intere&s;t which all his family-connections have obtained, do not give &s;ufficient &s;ecurity again&s;t this intrigue.</P>
<P>As every thing which pa&s;&s;es in the world be|comes matter for hi&s;tory, I will now quit this &s;ub|ject, and take a conci&s;e review of the &s;tate of par|ties and politics in England, as Mr. Burke has done in France.</P>
<P>Whether the pre&s;ent reign commenced with contempt, I leave to Mr. Burke: certain however it is, that it had &s;trongly that appearance. The animo&s;ity of the Engli&s;h Nation, it is very well remembered, ran high; and, had the true principles of Liberty been as well under&s;tood then as they now promi&s;e to be, it is probable the Nation would not have patiently &s;ubmitted to &s;o much. George the Fir&s;t and Second were &s;en&s;ible of a rival in the remains of the Stuarts; and as they could not but con&s;ider them&s;elves as &s;tanding on their good beha|viour, they had prudence to keep their German principles of Government to them&s;elves; but as the Stuart family wore away, the prudence be|came le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The conte&s;t between rights, and what were cal|led prerogatives, continued to heat the Nation till &s;ome time after the conclu&s;ion of the American War, when all at once it fell a calm&mdash;Execration exchanged it&s;elf for applau&s;e, and Court popularity &s;prung up like a mu&s;hroom in a night.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="145">To account for this &s;udden tran&s;ition, it is pro|per to ob&s;erve, that there are two di&s;tinct &s;pecies of popularity; the one excited by merit, the other by re&s;entment. As the Nation had formed it&s;elf into two parties, and each was extolling the merits of its parliamentary champions for and again&s;t prerogative, nothing could operate to give a more general &s;hock than an immediate coalition of the champions them&s;elves. The parti&s;ans of each being thus &s;uddenly left in the lurch, and mutually heated with di&s;gu&s;t at the mea&s;ure, felt no other relief than uniting in a common execration again&s;t both. A higher &s;timulus of re&s;entment being thus excited, than what the conte&s;t on prerogatives had occa&s;ioned, the Nation quitted all former objects of rights and wrongs, and &s;ought only that of gratification. The indignation at the Coalition, &s;o effectually &s;uper&s;eded the indignation again&s;t the Court, as to extingui&s;h it; and without any change of principles on the part of the Court, the &s;ame people who had reprobated its de&s;poti&s;m, united with it, to revenge them&s;elves on the Coalition Parliament. The ca&s;e was not, which they liked be&s;t,&mdash;but, which they hated mo&s;t; and the lea&s;t hated pa&s;&s;ed for love. The di&s;&s;olution of the Coalition Parliament, as it afforded the means of gratifying the re&s;entment of the Nation, could not fail to be popular; and from hence aro&s;e the popularity of the Court.</P>
<P>Tran&s;itions of this kind exhibit a Nation under the government of temper, in&s;tead of a fixed and &s;teady principle; and having once committed it&s;elf,
<PB N="144" REF="146">
however ra&s;hly, it feels it&s;elf urged along to ju&s;tify by continuance its fir&s;t proceeding.&mdash; Mea&s;ures which at other times it would cen&s;ure, it now approves, and acts per&s;ua&s;ion upon it&s;elf to &s;uffocate its judgment.</P>
<P>On the return of a new Parliament, the new Mini&s;ter, Mr. Pitt, found him&s;elf in a &s;ecure majority: and the nation gave him credit, not out of regard to him&s;elf, but becau&s;e it had re|&s;olved to do it out of re&s;entment to another. He introduced him&s;elf to public notice by a propo&s;ed Reform of Parliament, which in its operation would have amounted to a public ju&s;tification of corruption. The Nation was to be at the expence of buying up the rotten boroughs, whereas it ought to puni&s;h the per|&s;ons who deal in the traffic.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing over the two bubbles, of the Dutch bu&s;ine&s;s, and the million a-year to &s;ink the national debt, the matter which mo&s;t pre&s;ents it&s;elf, is the affair of the Regency. Never, in the cour&s;e of my ob&s;ervation, was delu&s;ion more &s;ucce&s;sfully acted nor a nation more com|pletely deceived.&mdash;But, to make this appear, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to go over the circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Mr. Fox had &s;tated in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, that the Prince of Wales, as heir in &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, had a right in him&s;elf to a&s;&s;ume the government. This was oppo&s;ed by Mr. Pitt; and, &s;o far as the oppo&s;ition was confined to the doctrine, it was ju&s;t. But the principles
<PB N="145" REF="147">
which Mr. Pitt maintained on the contrary &s;ide, were as bad, or wor&s;e in their extent, than tho&s;e of Mr. Fox; becau&s;e they went to e&s;tabli&s;h an ari&s;tocracy over the Nation, and over the &s;mall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">pre&s;entation it has in the Hou&s;e of Commons.</P>
<P>Whether the Engli&s;h form of Government be good or bad, is not in this ca&s;e the que&s;tion; but, taking it as it &s;tands, without regard to its merits or demerits, Mr. Pitt was farther from the point than Mr. Fox.</P>
<P>It is &s;uppo&s;ed to con&s;i&s;t of three parts:&mdash; while therefore the Nation is di&s;po&s;ed to con|tinue this form, the parts have a <HI>national &s;tanding,</HI> independent of each other, and are not the creatures of each other. Had Mr. Fox pa&s;&s;ed through Parliament, and &s;aid, that the per&s;on alluded to claimed on the ground of the Nation, Mr. Pitt mu&s;t then have contended (what he called) the right of the Parliament, again&s;t the right of the Nation.</P>
<P>By the appearance which the conte&s;t made, Mr. Fox took the hereditary ground, and Mr. Pitt the parliamentary ground; but the fact is, they both took hereditary ground, and Mr. Pitt took the wor&s;t of the two.</P>
<P>What is called the Parliament, is made up of two Hou&s;es; one of which is more hereditary, and more beyond the controul of the Nation, than what the Crown (as it is called) is &s;up|po&s;ed to be. It is an hereditary ari&s;tocracy, a&s;&s;uming and a&s;&s;erting indefea&s;ible, irrevokable rights and authority, wholly independent of the
<PB N="146" REF="148">
Nation. Where then was the merited popula|riity of exalting this hereditary power over ano|ther hereditary power le&s;s independent of the Nation than what it&s;elf a&s;&s;umed to be, and of ab&s;orbing the rights of the Nation into a Hou&s;e over which it has neither election nor controul?</P>
<P>The general impul&s;e of the Nation was right; but it acted without reflection. It approved the oppo&s;ition made to the right &s;et up by Mr. Fox, without perceiving that Mr. Pitt was &s;upporting another indefea&s;ible right, more remote from the Nation, in oppo&s;ition to it.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the Hou&s;e of Commons, it is elected but by a &s;mall part of the Nation; but were the election as univer&s;al as taxation, which it ought to be, it would &s;till be only the organ of the Nation, and cannot po&s;&s;e&s;s inher|ent rights.&mdash;When the National A&s;&s;embly of France re&s;olves a matter, the re&s;olve is made in right of the Nation; but Mr. Pitt, on all national que&s;tions, &s;o far as they refer to the Hou&s;e of Commons, ab&s;orbs the rights of the Nation into the organ, and makes the organ into a Nation, and the Nation it&s;elf into a cypher.</P>
<P>In a few words, the que&s;tion on the Regency was a que&s;tion on a million a-year, which is appropriated to the executive department: and Mr. Pitt could not po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of any management of this &s;um, without &s;etting up the &s;upremacy of Parliament; and when this was
<PB N="147" REF="149">
accompli&s;hed, it was indifferent who &s;hould be Regent, as he mu&s;t be Regent at his own co&s;t. Among the curio&s;ities which this contentious debate afforded, was that of making the Great Seal into a King; the affixing of which to an act, was to be royal authority. If, therefore, Royal Authority is a Great Seal, it con&s;e|quently is in it&s;elf nothing; and a good Con&s;ti|tution would be of infinitely more value to the Nation, than what the three Nominal Powers, as they now &s;tand, are worth.</P>
<P>The continual u&s;e of the word <HI>Con&s;titution</HI> in the Engli&s;h Parliament, &s;hews there is none; and that the whole is merely a form of Govern|ment without a Con&s;titution, and con&s;tituting it&s;elf with what powers it plea&s;es. If there were a Con&s;titution, it certainly could be referred to; and the debate on any con&s;titutional point, would terminate by producing the Con&s;titution. One member &s;ays, This is Con&s;titution; and another &s;ays, That is Con&s;titution&mdash;To-day it is one thing; and to-morrow, it is &s;omething el&s;e&mdash;while the maintaining the debate proves there is none. Con&s;titution is now the cant word of Parliament, tuning it&s;elf to the ear of the Nation. Formerly it was the <HI>univer&s;al &s;upremacy of Parliament</HI>&mdash;the <HI>omnipotence of Par|liament:</HI> But &s;ince the progre&s;s of Liberty in France, tho&s;e phra&s;es have a de&s;potic har&s;hne&s;s in their note; and the Engli&s;h Parliament have catched the fa&s;hion from the National A&s;&s;em|bly,
<PB N="148" REF="150">
but without the &s;ub&s;tance, of &s;peaking of <HI>Con&s;titution.</HI></P>
<P>As the pre&s;ent generation of people in Eng|land did not make the Government, they are not accountable for any of its defects; but that &s;ooner or later it mu&s;t come into their hands to undergo a con&s;titutional reformation, is as certain as that the &s;ame thing has happened in France. If France, with a revenue of nearly twenty-four millions &s;terling, with an extent of rich and fertile country above four times larger than England, with a population of twenty-four millions of inhabitants to &s;upport taxation, with upwards of ninety millions &s;terling of gold and &s;ilver circulating in the nation, and with a debt le&s;s than the pre&s;ent debt of England&mdash;&s;till found it nece&s;&s;ary, from whatever cau&s;e, to come to a &s;ettlement of its affairs, it &s;olves the problem of funding for both countries.</P>
<P>It is out of the que&s;tion to &s;ay how long what is called the Engli&s;h con&s;titution has la&s;ted, and to argue from thence how long it is to la&s;t; the que&s;tion is, how long can the funding &s;y&s;tem la&s;t? It is a thing but of modern invention, and has not yet continued beyond the life of a man; yet in that &s;hort &s;pace it has &s;o far accumulated, that, together with the current expences, it requires an amount of taxes at lea&s;t equal to the whole landed rental of the nation in acres to defray the annual ex|penditure.
<PB N="149" REF="151">
That a government could not al|ways have gone on by the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem which has been followed for the la&s;t &s;eventy years, mu&s;t be evident to every man; and for the &s;ame rea&s;on it cannot always go on.</P>
<P>The funding &s;y&s;tem is not money; neither is it, properly &s;peaking, credit. It in effect creates upon paper the &s;um which it appears to borrow, and lays on a tax to keep the imagi|nary capital alive by the payment of intere&s;t, and &s;ends the annuity to market, to be &s;old for paper already in circulation. If any credit is given, it is to the di&s;po&s;ition of the people to pay the tax, and not to the government which lays it on. When this di&s;po&s;ition expires, what is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the credit of Government expires with it. The in&s;tance of France under the former Government, &s;hews that it is im|po&s;&s;ible to compel the payment of taxes by force, when a whole nation is determined to take its &s;tand upon that ground.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke, in his review of the finances of France, &s;tates the quantity of gold and &s;ilver in France, at about eighty-eight millions &s;ter|ling. In doing this, he has, I pre&s;ume, divided by the difference of exchange, in&s;tead of the &s;tandard of twenty-four livres to a pound &s;ter|ling; for M. Neckar's &s;tatement, from which Mr. Burke's is taken, is <HI>two thou&s;and two hun|dred millions of livres,</HI> which is upwards of ninety-one millions and an half &s;terling.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="152">M. Neckar in France, and Mr. George Chalmers of the Office of Trade and Plantation in England, of which Lord Hawke&s;bury is pre&s;ident, publi&s;hed nearly about the &s;ame time (1786) an account of the quantity of money in each nation, from the returns of the Mint of each nation. Mr. Chalmers, from the returns of the Engli&s;h Mint at the Tower of London, &s;tates the quantity of money in England, in|cluding Scotland and Ireland, to be twenty millions &s;terling<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> E&s;timate of the Comparative Strength of Great Britain,<HI>by G. Chalmers.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>M. Neckar <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Admini&s;tration of the Finances of France, Vol. III. by M. Neckar.</NOTE> &s;ays, that the amount of money in France, recoined from the old coin which was called in, was two thou&s;and five hundred millions of livres, (upwards of one hundred and four millions &s;terling); and, after deducting for wa&s;te, and what may be in the We&s;t Indies, and other po&s;&s;ible circum&s;tances, &s;tates the circulation quantity at home, to be ninety-one millions and an half &s;terling; but, taking it as Mr. Burke has put it, it is &s;ixty-eight millions more than the national quantity in England.</P>
<P>That the quantity of money in France can|not be under this &s;um, may at once be &s;een from the &s;tate of the French Revenue, without referring to the records of the French Mint for proofs. The revenue of France prior to
<PB N="151" REF="153">
the Revolution, was nearly twenty-four mil|lions &s;terling; and as paper had then no exi&s;t|ence in France, the whole revenue was col|lected upon gold and &s;ilver; and it would have been impo&s;&s;ible to have collected &s;uch a quan|tity of revenue upon a le&s;s national quantity than M. Neckar has &s;tated. Before the e&s;tab|li&s;hment of paper in England, the revenue was about a fourth part of the national amount of gold and &s;ilver, as may be known by referring to the revenue prior to King William, and the quantity of money &s;tated to be in the nation at that time, which was nearly as much as it is now.</P>
<P>It can be of no real &s;ervice to a Nation, to impo&s;e upon it&s;elf, or to permit it&s;elf to be impo&s;ed upon; but the prejudices of &s;ome, and the impo&s;ition of others, have always repre|&s;ented France as a nation po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing but little money&mdash;whereas the quantity is not only more than four times what the quantity is in England, but is con&s;iderably greater on a proportion of numbers. To account for this deficiency on the part of England, &s;ome reference &s;hould be had to the Engli&s;h &s;y&s;tem of funding. It ope|rates to multiply paper, and to &s;ub&s;titute it in the room of money, in various &s;hapes; and the more paper is multiplied, the more opportu|nities are afforded to export the &s;pecie; and it admits of a po&s;&s;ibility (by extending it to
<PB N="152" REF="154">
&s;mall notes) of increa&s;ing paper till there is no money left.</P>
<P>I know this is not a plea&s;ant &s;ubject to Engli&s;h readers; but the matters I am going to mention, are &s;o important in them&s;elves, as to require the attention of men intere&s;ted in money-tran&s;actions of a public nature.&mdash;There is a circum&s;tance &s;tated by M. Neckar, in his treati&s;e on the admini&s;tration of the finances, which has never been attended to in England, but which forms the only ba&s;is whereon to e&s;ti|mate the quantity of money (gold and &s;ilver) which ought to be in every nation in Europe, to pre&s;erve a relative proportion with other nations.</P>
<P>Li&s;bon and Cadiz are the two ports into which (money) gold and &s;ilver from South America are imported, and which afterwards divides and &s;preads it&s;elf over Europe by means of commerce, and increa&s;es the quantity of money in all parts of Europe. If, therefore, the amount of the annual importation into Europe can be known, and the relative pro|portion of the foreign commerce of the &s;everal nations by which it is di&s;tributed can be a&s;cer|tained, they give a rule, &s;ufficiently true, to a&s;certain the quantity of money which ought to be found in any nation, at any given time.</P>
<P>M. Neckar &s;hews from the regi&s;ters of Li&s;|bon and Cadiz, that the importation of gold and &s;ilver into Europe, is five millions &s;terling
<PB N="153" REF="155">
annually. He has not taken it on a &s;ingle year, but on an average of fifteen &s;ucceeding years, from 1763 to 1777, both inclu&s;ive; in which time, the amount was one thou&s;and eight hundred million livres, which is &s;eventy-five millions &s;terling <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Admini&s;tration of the Finances of France, Vol. iii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>From the commencement of the Hanover &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in 1714, to the time Mr. Chalmers publi&s;hed, is &s;eventy-two years; and the quan|tity imported into Europe, in that time, would be three hundred and &s;ixty millions &s;terling.</P>
<P>If the foreign commerce of Great Britain be &s;tated at a &s;ixth part of what the whole foreign commerce of Europe amounts to, (which is probably an inferior e&s;timation to what the gentlemen at the Exchange would allow) the proportion which Britain &s;hould draw by commerce of this &s;um, to keep her&s;elf on a proportion with the re&s;t of Europe, would be al&s;o a &s;ixth part, which is &s;ixty mil|lions &s;terling; and if the &s;ame allowance for wa&s;te and accident be made for England which M. Neckar makes for France, the quantity remaining after the&s;e deductions would be fifty-two millions; and this &s;um ought to have been in the nation (at the time Mr. Chalmers pub|li&s;hed) in addition to the &s;um which was in the nation at the commencement of the Hano|ver &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and to have made in the whole at lea&s;t &s;ixty-&s;ix millions &s;terling; in&s;tead of
<PB N="154" REF="156">
which, there were but twenty millions, which is forty-&s;ix millions below its proportionate quantity.</P>
<P>As the quantity of gold and &s;ilver imported into Li&s;bon and Cadiz, is more exactly a&s;cer|tained than that of any commodity imported into England; and as the quantity of money coined at the Tower of London, is &s;till more po&s;itively known; the leading facts do not admit of controver&s;y. Either, therefore, the commerce of England is unproductive of profit, or the gold and &s;ilver which it brings in, leak continually away by un&s;een means, at the average rate of about three quarters of a million a-year, which, in the cour&s;e of &s;eventy-two years, accounts for the deficiency; and its ab&s;ence is &s;upplied by paper <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Whether the Engli&s;h commerce does not bring in money, or whether the Government &s;ends it out after it is brought in, is a matter which the parties concerned can be&s;t explain; but that the deficiency exi&s;ts, is not in the power of either to di&s;prove. While Dr. Price, Mr. Eden (now Auckland), Mr. Chalmers, and others, were debating whether the quantity of money in England was greater or le&s;s than at the Revolution, the circum|&s;tance was not adverted to, that &s;ince the Revolution, there can|not have been le&s;s than four hundred millions &s;terling imported into Europe; and therefore, the quantity in England ought at lea&s;t to have been four times greater than it was at the Revo|lution, to be on a proportion with Europe. What England is now doing by paper, is what &s;he would have been able to have done by &s;olid money, if gold and &s;ilver had come into the nation in the proportion it ought, or had not been &s;ent out; and &s;he is endeavouring to re&s;tore by paper, the balance &s;he has lo&s;t by money. It is certain, that the gold and &s;ilver which arrive annu|ally in the regi&s;ter-&s;hips to Spain and Portugal, do not remain in tho&s;e countries. Taking the value half in gold and half in &s;ilver, it is about four hundred tons annually; and from the number of &s;hips and galloons employed in the trade of bringing tho&s;e metals from South America to Portugal and Spain, the quantity &s;ufficiently proves it&s;elf, without referring to the regi&s;|ters.</P>
<P>In the &s;ituation England now is, it is impo&s;&s;ible &s;he can increa&s;e in money. High taxes not only le&s;&s;en the property of the indi|viduals, but they le&s;&s;en al&s;o the money-capital of a nation, by inducing &s;muggling, which can only be carried on by gold and &s;ilver. By the politics which the Briti&s;h Government have carried on with the Inland Powers of Germany and the Continent, it has made an enemy of all the Maritime Powers, and is there|fore obliged to keep up a large navy; but though the navy is built in England, the naval &s;tores mu&s;t be purcha&s;ed from abroad, and that from countries where the greate&s;t part mu&s;t be paid for in gold and &s;ilver. Some fallacious rumours have been &s;et afloat in England to induce a belief of money, and, among others, that of the French refugees bringing great quantities. The idea is ridiculous. The general part of the money in France is &s;ilver; and it would take upwards of twenty of the large&s;t broad wheel waggons, with ten hor&s;es each, to remove one million &s;terling of &s;ilver. Is it then to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that a few people fleeing on hor&s;e-back, or in po&s;t-chai&s;es, in a &s;ecret manner, and having the French Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e to pa&s;s, and the &s;ea to cro&s;s, could bring even a &s;ufficiency for their own expences?</P>
<P>When millions of money are &s;poken of, it &s;hould be recollected, that &s;uch &s;ums can only accumulate in a country by &s;low degrees, and a long proce&s;&s;ion of time. The mo&s;t frugal &s;y&s;tem that England could now adopt, would not recover, in a century, the balance &s;he has lo&s;t in money &s;ince the commencement of the Hanover &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. She is &s;eventy millions behind France, and &s;he mu&s;t be in &s;ome con&s;iderable proportion behind every country in Europe, becau&s;e the returns of the Engli&s;h Mint do not &s;hew an increa&s;e of money, while the regi&s;ters of Li&s;bon and Cadiz &s;hew an European increa&s;e of between three and four hundred millions &s;terling.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="157">The Revolution of France is attended with many novel circum&s;tances, not only in the po|litical
<PB N="156" REF="158">
&s;phere, but in the circle of money tran&s;|actions. Among others, it &s;hews that a Go|vernment may be in a &s;tate of in&s;olvency, and a Nation rich. So far as the fact is confined to the late Government of France, it was in|&s;olvent; becau&s;e the Nation would no longer &s;upport its extravagance, and therefore it could no longer &s;upport it&s;elf&mdash;but with re&s;pect to the Nation, all the means exi&s;ted. A Govern|ment may be &s;aid to be in&s;olvent, every time it applies to a Nation to di&s;charge its arrears. The in&s;olvency of the late Government of France, and the pre&s;ent Government of Eng|land, differed in no other re&s;pect than as the di&s;po&s;ition of the people differ. The people of France refu&s;ed their aid to the old Govern|ment; and the people of England &s;ubmit to taxation without enquiry. What is called the Crown in England, has been in&s;olvent &s;everal times; the la&s;t of which, publicly known, was in May 1777, when it applied to the Nation to di&s;charge upwards of &pound;. 600,000, private debts, which otherwi&s;e it could not pay.</P>
<P>It was the error of Mr. Pitt, Mr. Burke, and all tho&s;e who were unacquainted with the affairs of France, to confound the French Na|tion with the French Government. The French Nation, in effect, endeavoured to render the late Government in&s;olvent, for the purpo&s;e of taking Government into its own hands; and it re&s;erved its means for the &s;upport of the new
<PB N="157" REF="159">
Government. In a country of &s;uch va&s;t extent and population as France, the natural means cannot be wanting; and the political means appear the in&s;tant the Nation is di&s;po&s;ed to permit them. When Mr. Burke, in a &s;peech la&s;t Winter in the Briti&s;h Parliament, <HI>ca&s;t his eyes over the map of Europe, and &s;aw a cha&s;m that once was France,</HI> he talked like a dreamer of dreams. The &s;ame natural France exi&s;ted as be|fore, and all the natural means exi&s;ted with it. The only cha&s;m was that which the extinction of de&s;poti&s;m had left, and which was to be filled up with a con&s;titution more formidable in re&s;ources than the power which had expired.</P>
<P>Although the French Nation rendered the late Government in&s;olvent, it did not permit the in&s;olvency to act towards the creditors; and the creditors con&s;idering the Nation as the real payma&s;ter, and the Government only as the agent, re&s;ted them&s;elves on the Nation, in pre|ference to the Government. This appears greatly to di&s;turb Mr. Burke, as the precedent is fatal to the policy by which Governments have &s;uppo&s;ed them&s;elves &s;ecure. They have contracted debts, with a view of attaching what is called the monied intere&s;t of a Nation to their &s;upport; but the example in France &s;hews, that the permanent &s;ecurity of the creditor is in the Nation, and not in the Government; and that in all po&s;&s;ible revolutions that may happen in Governments, the means are always with the
<PB N="158" REF="160">
Nation, and the Nation always in exi&s;tence. Mr. Burke argues, that the creditors ought to have abided the fate of the Government which they tru&s;ted; but the National A&s;&s;embly con|&s;idered them as the creditors of the Nation, and not of the Government&mdash;of the ma&s;ter, and not of the &s;teward.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the late Government could not di&s;charge the current expences, the pre&s;ent Government has paid off a great part of the capital. This has been accompli&s;hed by two means; the one by le&s;&s;ening the expences of Government, and the other by the &s;ale of the mona&s;tic and eccle&s;ia&s;tical landed e&s;tates. The devotees and penitent debauchees, extortioners and mi&s;ers of former days, to en&s;ure them&s;elves a better world than that which they were about to leave, had bequeathed immen&s;e property in tru&s;t to the prie&s;thood, for <HI>pious u&s;es;</HI> and the prie&s;thood kept it for them&s;elves. The Na|tional A&s;&s;embly has ordered it to be &s;old for the good of the whole Nation, and the prie&s;t|hood to be decently provided for.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the Revolution, the an|nual intere&s;t of the debt of France will be re|duced at lea&s;t &s;ix millions &s;terling, by paying off upwards of one hundred millions of the capital; which, with le&s;&s;ening the former ex|pences of Government at lea&s;t three millions, will place France in a &s;ituation worthy the imitation of Europe.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="161">Upon a whole review of the &s;ubject, how va&s;t is the contra&s;t! While Mr. Burke has been talking of a general bankruptcy in France, the National A&s;&s;embly has been paying off the capital of its debt; and while taxes have increa&s;ed near a million a-year in England, they have lowered &s;everal millions a-year in France. Not a word has either Mr. Burke or Mr. Pitt &s;aid about French affairs, or the &s;tate of the French finances, in the pre&s;ent Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament. The &s;ubject begins to be too well under&s;tood, and impo&s;ition &s;erves no longer.</P>
<P>There is a general enigma running through the whole of Mr. Burke's Book. He writes in a rage again&s;t the National A&s;&s;embly; but what is he enraged about? If his a&s;&s;ertions were as true as they are groundle&s;s, and that France, by her Revolution, had annihilated her power, and become what he calls a <HI>cha&s;m,</HI> it might excite the grief of a Frenchman, (con|&s;idering him&s;elf as a national man), and pro|voke his rage again&s;t the National A&s;&s;embly; but why &s;hould it excite the rage of Mr. Burke?&mdash;Alas! it is not the Nation of France that Mr. Burke means, but the COURT; and every Court in Europe, dreading the &s;ame fate, is in mourning. He writes neither in the cha|racter of a Frenchman nor an Engli&s;hman, but in the fawning character of that creature known in all countries, and a friend to none,
<PB N="160" REF="162">
a COURTIER. Whether it be the Court of Ver&s;ailles, or the Court of St. James or Carl|ton-Hou&s;e, or the Court in expectation, &s;ig|nifies not; for the caterpillar principle of all Courts and Courtiers are alike. They form a common policy throughout Europe, detached and &s;eparate from the intere&s;t of Nations: and while they appear to quarrel, they agree to plunder. Nothing can be more terrible to a Court or a Courtier, than the Revolution of France. That which is a ble&s;&s;ing to Nations, is bitterne&s;s to them; and as their exi&s;tence depends on the duplicity of a country, they tremble at the approach of principles, and dread the precedent that threatens their over|throw.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>REASON and Ignorance, the oppo&s;ites of each other, influence the great bulk of man|kind. If either of the&s;e can be rendered &s;uffi|ciently exten&s;ive in a country, the machinery of Government goes ea&s;ily on. Rea&s;on obeys it&s;elf; and Ignorance &s;ubmits to whatever is dictated to it.</P>
<P>The two modes of Government which pre|vail in the world, are, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> Government by election and repre&s;entation: <HI>Secondly,</HI> Govern|ment by hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The former is generally known by the name of republic; the latter by that of monarchy and ari&s;tocracy.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e two di&s;tinct and oppo&s;ite forms, erect them&s;elves on the two di&s;tinct and oppo&s;ite ba&s;es of Rea&s;on and Ignorance.&mdash;As the exer|ci&s;e of Government requires talents and abili|ties, and as talents and abilities cannot have hereditary de&s;cent, it is evident that hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion requires a belief from man, to which his rea&s;on cannot &s;ub&s;cribe, and which can only be e&s;tabli&s;hed upon his ignorance; and the more ignorant any country is, the better it is fitted for this &s;pecies of Government.</P>
<P>On the contrary, Government in a well-con&s;tituted republic, requires no belief from man beyond what his rea&s;on can give. He &s;ees the <HI>rationale</HI> of the whole &s;y&s;tem, its origin and its operation; and as it is be&s;t &s;upported
<PB N="162" REF="164">
when be&s;t under&s;tood, the human faculties act with boldne&s;s, and acquire, under this form of Government, a gigantic manline&s;s.</P>
<P>As, therefore, each of tho&s;e forms acts on a different ba&s;e, the one moving freely by the aid of rea&s;on, the other by ignorance; we have next to con&s;ider, what it is that gives motion to that &s;pecies of Government which is called mixed Government, or, as it is &s;ometimes lu|dicrou&s;ly &s;tiled, a Government of <HI>this, that,</HI> and <HI>t'other.</HI></P>
<P>The moving power in this &s;pecies of Go|vernment, is of nece&s;&s;ity, Corruption. How|ever imperfect election and repre&s;entation may be in mixed Governments, they &s;till give ex|erci&s;e to a greater portion of rea&s;on than is con|venient to the hereditary Part; and therefore it becomes nece&s;&s;ary to buy the rea&s;on up. A mixed Government is an imperfect every-thing, cementing and &s;oldering the di&s;cordant parts toge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">her by corruption, to act as a whole. Mr. Burke appears highly di&s;gu&s;ted, that France, &s;ince &s;he had re&s;olved on a revolution, did not adopt what he calls <HI>"A Briti&s;h Con&s;titution;"</HI> and the regretful manner in which he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf on this occa&s;ion, implies a &s;u&s;picion, that the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution needed &s;omething to keep its defects in countenance.</P>
<P>In mixed Governments there is no re&s;pon&s;i|bility: the parts cover each other till re&s;pon|&s;ibility is lo&s;t; and the corruption which moves
<PB N="163" REF="165">
the machine, contrives at the &s;ame time its own e&s;cape. When it is laid down as a maxim, that <HI>a King can do no wrong,</HI> it places him in a &s;tate of &s;imilar &s;ecurity with that of ideots and per&s;ons in&s;ane, and re&s;pon&s;ibility is out of the que&s;tion with re&s;pect to him&s;elf. It then de&s;cends upon the Mini&s;ter, who &s;hel|ters him&s;elf under a majority in Parliament, which, by places, pen&s;ions, and corruption, he can always command; and that majority ju&s;ti|fies it&s;elf by the &s;ame authority with which it protects the Mini&s;ter. In this rotatory motion, re&s;pon&s;ibility is thrown off from the parts, and from the whole.</P>
<P>When there is a Part in a Government which can do no wrong, it implies that it does no|thing; and is only the machine of another power, by who&s;e advice and direction it acts. What is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the King in mixed Governments, is the Cabinet; and as the Ca|binet is always a part of the Parliament, and the members ju&s;tifying in one character what they advi&s;e and act in another, a mixed Go|vernment becomes a continual enigma; entail|ing upon a country, by the quantity of cor|ruption nece&s;&s;ary to &s;older the parts, the ex|pence of &s;upporting all the forms of Govern|ment at once, and finally re&s;olving it&s;elf into a Government by Committee; in which the advi&s;ers, the actors, the approvers, the ju&s;ti|fiers,
<PB N="164" REF="166">
the per&s;ons re&s;pon&s;ible, and the per&s;ons not re&s;pon&s;ible, are the &s;ame per&s;ons.</P>
<P>By this pantomimical contrivance, and change of &s;cene and character, the parts help each other out in matters which neither of them &s;ingly would a&s;&s;ume to act. When money is to be obtained, the ma&s;s of variety apparently di&s;&s;olves, and a profu&s;ion of parliamentary prai&s;es pa&s;&s;es between the parts. Each ad|mires with a&s;toni&s;hment, the wi&s;dom, the libe|rality, the di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of the other; and all of them breathe a pitying &s;igh at the bur|thens of the Nation.</P>
<P>But in a well-con&s;tituted republic, nothing of this &s;oldering, prai&s;ing, and pitying, can take place; the repre&s;entation being equal through|out the country, and compleat in it&s;elf, however it may be arranged into legi&s;lative and execu|tive, they have all one and the &s;ame natural &s;ource. The parts are not foreigners to each other, like democracy, ari&s;tocracy, and monar|chy. As there are no di&s;cordant di&s;tinctions, there is nothing to corrupt by compromi&s;e, nor confound by contrivance. Public mea&s;ures appeal of them&s;elves to the under&s;tanding of the Nation, and, re&s;ting on their own merits, di&s;|own any flattering application to vanity. The continual whine of lamenting the burden of taxes, however &s;ucce&s;sfully it may be practi&s;ed in mixed Governments, is incon&s;i&s;tent with the
<PB N="165" REF="167">
&s;en&s;e and &s;pirit of a republic. If taxes are nece&s;&s;ary, they are of cour&s;e advantageous; but if they require an apology, the apology it&s;elf implies an impeachment. Why then is man thus impo&s;ed upon, or why does he impo&s;e upon him&s;elf?</P>
<P>When men are &s;poken of as kings and &s;ubjects, or when Government is mentioned under the di&s;|tinct or combined heads of monarchy, ari&s;tocracy, and democracy, what is it that <HI>rea&s;oning</HI> man is to under&s;tand by the terms? If there really exi&s;ted in the world two or more di&s;tinct and &s;eparate <HI>elements</HI> of human power, we &s;hould then &s;ee the &s;everal origins to which tho&s;e terms would de|&s;criptively apply: but as there is but one &s;pecies of man, there can be but one element of human power; and that element is man him&s;elf. Monar|chy, ari&s;tocracy, and democracy, are but creatures of imagination; and a thou&s;and &s;uch may be con|trived, as well as three.</P>
<P>From the Revolutions of America and France, and the &s;ymptoms that have appeared in other coun|tries, it is evident that the opinion of the world is changed with re&s;pect to &s;y&s;tems of Government, and that revolutions are not within the compa&s;s of political calculations. The progre&s;s of time and circum&s;tances, which men a&s;&s;ign to the accompli&s;h|ment of great changes, is too mechanical to mea|&s;ure the force of the mind, and the rapidity of reflection, by which revolutions are generated:
<PB N="166" REF="168">
All the old governments have received a &s;hock from tho&s;e that already appear, and which were once more improbable, and are a greater &s;ubject of wonder, than a general revolution in Europe would be now.</P>
<P>When we &s;urvey the wretched condition of man under the monarchical and hereditary &s;y&s;tems of Government, dragged from his home by one power, or driven by another, and impoveri&s;hed by taxes more than by enemies, it becomes evident that tho&s;e &s;y&s;tems are bad, and that a general revo|lution in the principle and con&s;truction of Govern|ments is nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>What is government more than the management of the affairs of a Nation? It is not, and from its nature cannot be, the property of any particular man or family, but of the whole community, at who&s;e expence it is &s;upported; and though by force or contrivance it has been u&s;urped into an inheritance, the u&s;urpation cannot alter the right of things. Sovereignty, as a matter of right, appertains to the Nation only, and not to any individual; and a Nation has at all times an in|herent indefea&s;ible right to aboli&s;h any form of Government it finds inconvenient, and e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch as accords with its intere&s;t, di&s;po&s;ition, and happine&s;s. The romantic and barbarous di&s;tinction of men into Kings and &s;ubjects, though it may &s;uit the condition of courtiers, cannot that of citizens; and is exploded by the principle upon which Governments are now founded. Every
<PB N="167" REF="169">
citizen is a member of the Sovereignty, and, as &s;uch, can acknowledge no per&s;onal &s;ubjection; and his obedience can be only to the laws.</P>
<P>When men think of what Government is, they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;e it to po&s;&s;e&s;s a knowledge of all the objects and matters upon which its authority is to be exerci&s;ed. In this view of Go|vernment, the republican &s;y&s;tem, as e&s;tabli&s;hed by America and France, operates to embrace the whole of a Nation; and the knowledge nece&s;&s;ary to the in|tere&s;t of all the parts, is to be found in the center, which the parts by repre&s;entation form: But the old Governments are on a con&s;truction that ex|cludes knowledge as well as happine&s;s; Govern|ment by Monks, who know nothing of the world beyond the walls of a Convent, is as con&s;i&s;tent as government by Kings.</P>
<P>What were formerly called Revolutions, were little more than a change of per&s;ons, or an altera|tion of local circum&s;tances. They ro&s;e and fell like things of cour&s;e, and had nothing in their exi&s;tence or their fate that could influence beyond the &s;pot that produced them. But what we now &s;ee in the world, from the Revolutions of America and France, are a renovation of the natural order of things, a &s;y&s;tem of principles as univer&s;al as truth and the exi&s;tence of man, and combining moral with political happine&s;s and national pro|&s;perity.</P>
<P N="1"><Q><HI>I.</HI> Men are born and always continue free, and equal in re&s;pect of their rights. Civil di&s;tinctions, therefore, can be founded only on public utility.</Q></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="168" REF="170"><Q><HI>II.</HI> The end of all political a&s;&s;ociations is the pre|&s;ervation of the natural and impre&s;criptible rights of man; and the&s;e rights are liberty, property, &s;ecurity, and re&s;i&s;tance of oppre&s;&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P N="3"><Q><HI>III.</HI> The Nation is e&s;&s;entially the &s;ource of all So|vereignty; nor can any <HI>INDIVIDUAL,</HI> or <HI>ANY BODY OF MEN,</HI> be entitled to any authority which is not expre&s;sly derived from it.</Q></P>
<P>In the&s;e principles, there is nothing to throw a Nation into confu&s;ion by inflaming ambition. They are calculated to call forth wi&s;dom and abilities, and to exerci&s;e them for the public good, and not for the emolument or aggrandizement of particular de&s;criptions of men or families. Monar|chical &s;overeignty, the enemy of mankind, and the &s;ource of mi&s;ery, is aboli&s;hed; and &s;overeignty it&s;elf is re&s;tored to its natural and original place, the Nation. Were this the ca&s;e throughout Europe, the cau&s;e of wars would be taken away.</P>
<P>It is attributed to Henry the Fourth of France, a man of an enlarged and benevolent heart, that he propo&s;ed, about the year 1610, a plan for aboli&s;hing war in Europe. The plan con&s;i&s;ted in con&s;tituting an European Congre&s;s, or as the French Authors &s;tile it, a Pacific Republic; by appointing delegates from the &s;everal Nations, who were to act as a Court of arbitration in any di&s;putes that might ari&s;e between nation and nation.</P>
<P>Had &s;uch a plan been adopted at the time it was propo&s;ed, the taxes of England and France, as two of the parties, would have been at lea&s;t ten millions &s;terling annually to each Nation le&s;s than
<PB N="169" REF="171">
they were at the commencement of the French Revolution.</P>
<P>To conceive a cau&s;e why &s;uch a plan has not been adopted, (and that in&s;tead of a Congre&s;s for the purpo&s;e of <HI>preventing</HI> war, it has been called only to <HI>terminate</HI> a war, after a fruitle&s;s expence of &s;everal years), it will be nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider the intere&s;t of Governments as a di&s;tinct intere&s;t to that of Nations.</P>
<P>Whatever is the cau&s;e of taxes to a Nation, becomes al&s;o the means of revenue to a Govern|ment. Every war terminates with an addition of taxes, and con&s;equently with an addition of revenue; and in any event of war, in the manner they are now commenced and concluded, the power and intere&s;t of Governments are increa&s;ed. War, therefore, from its productivene&s;s, as it ea&s;ily furni&s;hes the pretence of nece&s;&s;ity for taxes and appointments to places and offices, becomes a prin|cipal part of the &s;y&s;tem of old Governments; and to e&s;tabli&s;h any mode to aboli&s;h war, however advantageous it might be to Nations, would be to take from &s;uch Government the mo&s;t lucrative of its branches. The frivolous matters upon which war is made, &s;hew the di&s;po&s;ition and avidity of Governments to uphold the &s;y&s;tem of war, and betray the motives upon which they act.</P>
<P>Why are not Republics plunged into war, but becau&s;e the nature of their Government does not admit of an intere&s;t di&s;tinct from that of the Nation? Even Holland, though an ill-con&s;tructed Republic,
<PB N="170" REF="172">

<P>As war is the &s;y&s;tem of Government on the old con&s;truction, the animo&s;ity which Nations reciprocally entertain, is nothing more than what the policy of their Governments excites, to keep up the &s;pirit of the &s;y&s;tem. Each Government accu&s;es the other of perfidy, intrigue, and ambition, as a means of heating the imagination of their re&s;pective Nations, and incen&s;ing them to ho&s;tilities. Man is not the enemy of man, but through the medium of a fal&s;e &s;y&s;tem of Government. In&s;tead, there|fore, of exclaiming again&s;t the ambition of Kings, the exclamation &s;hould be directed again&s;t the principle of &s;uch Governments; and in&s;tead of &s;eeking to reform the individual, the wi&s;dom of a Nation &s;hould apply it&s;elf to reform the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>Whether the forms and maxims of Govern|ments which are &s;till in practice, were adapted to the condition of the world at the period they were e&s;tabli&s;hed, is not in this ca&s;e the que&s;tion. The order they are, the le&s;s corre&s;pondence can they have with the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things. Time, and change of circum&s;tances and opinions, have the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e progre&s;&s;ive effect in rendering modes of Government ob&s;olete, as they have upon cu&s;toms
<PB N="171" REF="173">
and manners.&mdash;Agriculture, commerce, manufac|tures, and the tranquil arts, by which the pro&s;perity of Nations is be&s;t promoted, require a different &s;y&s;tem of Government, and a different &s;pecies of knowledge to direct its operations, than what might have been required in the former condition of the world.</P>
<P>As it is not difficult to perceive, from the enlightened &s;tate of mankind, that hereditary Governments are verging to their decline, and that Revolutions on the broad ba&s;is of national &s;overeignty, and Government by repre&s;entation, are making their way in Europe, it would be an act of wi&s;dom to anticipate their approach, and produce Revolutions by rea&s;on and accommoda|tion, rather than commit them to the i&s;&s;ue of con|vul&s;ions.</P>
<P>From what we now &s;ee, nothing of reform in the political world ought to be held improbable. It is an age of Revolutions, in which every thing may be looked for. The intrigue of Courts, by which the &s;y&s;tem of war is kept up, may provoke a confederation of Nations to aboli&s;h it: and an European Congre&s;s, to patronize the progre&s;s of free Government, and promote the civilization of Nations with each other, is an event nearer in probability, than once were the revolutions and alliance of France and America.</P>
