<HEAD>PARIS, <HI>SEPTEMBER 25.</HI> (Fir&s;t Year of the Republic.)</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>FELLOW CITIZENS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>I RECEIVE, with affectionate gratitude, the honour which the late National A&s;&s;embly has conferred upon me, by adopting me a Citizen of France; and the additional honour of being elected by my Fellow-Citizens a Member of the National Convention. Happily impre&s;&s;ed, as I am, by tho&s;e te&s;timonies of re&s;pect &s;hewn towards me as an individual, I feel my feli|city encrea&s;ed by &s;eeing the barrier broken down that divided Patrioti&s;m by &s;pots of earth, and limited Citizen&s;hip to the &s;oil, like ve|getation.</P>
<P>Had tho&s;e honours been conferred in an hour of national tranquillity, they would have afforded no other means of &s;hewing my affec|tion, than to have accepted and enjoyed them; but they come accompanied with circum|&s;tances that give me the honourable opportu|nity of commencing my Citizen&s;hip in the &s;tormy hour of difficulties. I come not to
<PB N="4" REF="3">enjoy repo&s;e. Convinced that the cau&s;e of France is the cau&s;e of all mankind, and that as liberty cannot be purcha&s;ed by a wi&s;h, I gladly &s;hare with you the dangers and honours nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>I am well aware that the moment of any great change, &s;uch as that accompli&s;hed on the 10th of Augu&s;t, is unavoidably the mo|ment of terror and confu&s;ion. The mind, highly agitated by hope, &s;u&s;picion, and ap|prehen&s;ion, continues without re&s;t till the change be accompli&s;hed. But let us now look calmy and confidentially forward, and &s;ucce&s;s is certain. It is no longer the paltry cau&s;e of Kings, or of this, or of that indivi|dual, that calls France and her armies into action. It is the great cau&s;e of ALL. It is the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a new aera, that &s;hall blot De&s;poti&s;m from the earth, and fix, on the la&s;ting principles of Peace and Citizen&s;hip, the great Republic of Man.</P>
<P>It has been my fate to have borne a &s;hare in the commencement and complete e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of one Revolution (I mean the Revolu|tion of America). The &s;ucce&s;s and events of that Revolution are encouraging to us. The pro&s;perity and happine&s;s that have &s;ince flowed
<PB N="5" REF="4">to that country, have amply rewarded her for all the hard&s;hips &s;he endured, and for all the dangers &s;he encountered.</P>
<P>The principles on which that Revolu|tion began, have extended them&s;elve to Eu|rope; and an over-ruling Providence is rege|nerating the Old World by the principles of the New. The di&s;tance of America from all the other parts of the globe, did not admit of her carrying tho&s;e principles beyond her own &s;ituation. It is to the peculiar honour of France, that &s;he now rai&s;es the &s;tandard of Liberty for all nations; and in fighting her own battles, contends for the rights of all mankind.</P>
<P>The &s;ame &s;pirit of fortitude that in&s;ured &s;ucce&s;s to America, will in&s;ure it to France; for it is impo&s;&s;ible to conquer a nation de|termined to be free! The military circum|&s;tances that now unite them&s;elves to France, are &s;uch as the De&s;pots of the earth know nothing of, and can form no calculation upon. They know not what it is to fight again&s;t a nation. They have only been accu&s;tomed to make war upon each other, and they know from &s;y&s;tem and practice, how to calculate the probable &s;ucce&s;s of de&s;pot again&s;t de&s;pot; and
<PB N="6" REF="5">here their knowledge and their experience end.</P>
<P>But in a conte&s;t like the pre&s;ent, a new and boundle&s;s variety of circum&s;tances ari&s;es, that deranges all &s;uch cu&s;tomary calculations. When a whole nation acts as an army, the de&s;pot knows not the extent of the power again&s;t which he contends. New armies ri&s;e again&s;t him with the nece&s;&s;ity of the moment. It is then that the difficulties of an invading enemy multiply, as in the former ca&s;e they dimini&s;hed; and he finds them at their height when he expected them to end.</P>
<P>The only war that has any &s;imilarity of circum&s;tances with the pre&s;ent, is the late Revolution-war in America. On her part, as it now is in France, it was a war of the whole nation.&mdash;There it was that the enemy, by beginning to conquer, put him&s;elf in a con|dition of being conquered. His fir&s;t victories prepared him for defeat. He advanced till he could not retreat, and found him&s;elf in the mid&s;t of a nation of armies.</P>
<P>Were it now to be propo&s;ed to the Au&s;|trians and Pru&s;&s;ians to e&s;cort them into the middle of France, and there leave them to make the mo&s;t of &s;uch a &s;ituation, they would
<PB N="7" REF="6">&s;ee too much into the dangers of it to accept the offer, and the &s;ame dangers would attend them could they arive there by any other means. Where then is the military policy of their attempting to obtain by force, that which they would refu&s;e by choice. But to rea&s;on with de&s;pots is throwing rea&s;on away. The be&s;t of arguments is a vigorous preparation.</P>
<P>Man is ever a &s;tranger to the ways by which Providence regulates the order of things. The interference of foreign De&s;pots may &s;erve to introduce into their own en&s;laved countries the principles they come to oppo&s;e. Liberty and Equality are ble&s;&s;ings too great to be the inheritance of France alone. It is honour to her to be their fir&s;t champion; and &s;he may now &s;ay to her enemies, with a mighty voice, "O! ye Au&s;trians, ye Pru&s;&s;ians! ye who now turn your bayonets again&s;t us; it is for all Europe; it is for all mankind, and not for France alone, that &s;he rai&s;es the &s;tandard of Liberty and Equality!"</P>
<P>The public cau&s;e has hitherto &s;uffered from the contradictions contained in the Con|&s;titution of the former Con&s;tituent A&s;&s;embly. Tho&s;e contradictions have &s;erved to divide the opinions of individuals at home, and to ob&s;cure
<PB N="8" REF="7">the great principles of the Revolution in other countries. But when tho&s;e contradictions &s;hall be removed, and the Con&s;titution be made conformable to the Declaration of Rights; when the bagatelles of monarchy, royalty, regency, and hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, &s;hall be expo&s;ed, with all their ab&s;urdities, a new ray of light will be thrown over the world, and the Revolution will derive new &s;trength by being univer&s;ally under&s;tood.</P>
<P>The &s;cene that now opens it&s;elf to France extends far beyond the boundaries of her own dominions. Every Nation is becoming her colleague, and every Court is become her ene|my. It is now the cau&s;e of all nations again&s;t the cau&s;e of all Courts. The terror that de&s;|poti&s;m felt, clande&s;tinely begot a confedera|tion of De&s;pots; and their attack upon France was produced by their fears at home.</P>
<P>In entering on this great &s;cene, greater than any nation has yet been called to act in, let us &s;ay to the agitated mind, be calm. Let us puni&s;h by in&s;tructing, rather than by re|venge. Let us begin the new aera by a great|ne&s;s of friend&s;hip, and hail the approach of union and &s;ucce&s;s.</P></Q>
