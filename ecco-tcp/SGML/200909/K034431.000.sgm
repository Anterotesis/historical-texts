<P>THE Author's compliments to Mi&s;s EL|LIOT, and he de&s;ires to in&s;cribe to her the following &s;cenes. She need not be alarmed at a dedication, the propriety of which will &s;trike every reader, who remembers that Mi&s;s ELLIOT and the CITIZEN made their fir&s;t appearance on the &s;tage together, and that her uncommon talents gave the piece the be&s;t and mo&s;t effectual protection. Elegance of figure, a voice of plea|&s;ing variety, a &s;trong expre&s;&s;ion of humour, not impaired, but rendered exqui&s;ite, by delicacy; the&s;e were circum&s;tances that &s;ecured the farce at fir&s;t, and have &s;ince brought it into favour. No author ever met with a better patronage; and though the CITIZEN, like other <HI>things of this kind,</HI> has many faults, yet it has this peculiar merit, that it produced, in the character of MA|RIA, a genuine comic genius. The CITIZEN claims another prai&s;e. When all the little arts of theatrical malice were con&s;piring again&s;t her, it recommended Mi&s;s ELLIOT to the notice of Mr. BEARD, and obtained for her that generous treat|ment, which <HI>that manager</HI> &s;eems determined to extend to real merit. The Author therefore de|&s;ires Mi&s;s ELLIOT'S acceptance of this farce, for the defects of which he makes no apology, be|cau&s;e, &s;hould the mo&s;t &s;evere judge in this kind re&s;olve to arm him&s;elf with critici&s;ms, let him but look at the acting of MARIA, <HI>and he will forget them all.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Beau.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, you have no rea&s;on to complain; you are come up to town, po&s;t-ha&s;te, to marry a wealthy citizen's daughter, who only &s;aw you la&s;t &s;ea&s;on at Tun|bridge, and has been langui&s;hing for you ever &s;ince.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's more than I do for her; and to tell you the truth, more than I believe &s;he does for me.&mdash;This is a match of prudence, man! bargain and &s;ale!&mdash;My reverend dad and the old put of a citizen fini&s;hed the bu&s;ine&s;s at Lloyd's Coffee-hou&s;e by inch of candle&mdash;a mere transferring of property!&mdash;<Q>Give your &s;on to my daughter, and I will give my daughter to your &s;on.</Q> That's the whole affair, and &s;o I am ju&s;t ar|rived to con&s;ummate the nuptials.</P>

<P>Well! that is &s;o like you&mdash;Mi&s;s Sally Phil|pot&mdash;</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay! very true&mdash;Mi&s;s Sally Philpot&mdash;&s;he will bring fortune &s;ufficient to pay off an old incumbrance upon the family-e&s;tate, and my father is to &s;ettle hand|&s;omely upon me&mdash;and &s;o I have rea&s;on to be contented, have not I?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beau.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you are willing to marry her, without having one &s;park of love for her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Love!&mdash;why I make my&s;elf ridiculous enough by marrying, don't I? without being in love into the bargain! What! am I to pine for a girl that is willing to go to bed to me? Love of all things!&mdash;My dear Beaufort, one &s;ees &s;o many people breathing raptures about each other before marriage, and dinning their in&s;ipidity into the ears of all their acquaintance; <Q>My dear ma'am, don't you think him a &s;weet man? charminger creature never was.</Q> Then he, on his &s;ide&mdash; <Q>My life, my angel, oh! &s;he's a paradi&s;e of ever blooming &s;weets.</Q> And then in a month's time, <Q>He's a perfidious wretch!

<P>Pho! this is all idle talk; and in the mean time, I am ruin'd&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>How &s;o?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beau.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you know the old couple have bargain'd your &s;i&s;ter away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bargain'd her away! and will you pretend you are in love?&mdash;Can you look tamely on, and &s;ee her barter'd away at Garraway's like logwood, cochineal, or indigo? Marry her privately, man, and keep it a &s;ecret till my affair is over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beau.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Wilding, will you propo&s;e it to her</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart&mdash;She is very long a com|ing&mdash;I'll tell you what, if &s;he has a fancy for you, carry her off at once&mdash;But perhaps &s;he has a mind to this cub of a citizen, Mi&s;s Sally's brother&mdash;</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beau.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! a diamond of the fir&s;t water! a buck, Sir, a blood! every night at this end of the town; at twelve next day he &s;neaks about the Change, in a little bit of a frock and a bob-wig, and looks like a &s;edate book-keeper in the eyes of all who behold him.</P>

<P>Upon my word, a gentleman of &s;pirit.</P>
