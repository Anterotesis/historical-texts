<HEAD>THE GENERAL PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>TRadition has in no In&s;tance &s;o clearly evinced her Faith|fulne&s;s, as in the tran&s;mitting of vulgar Rites and po|pular Opinions.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e, when we are de&s;irous of tracing them backwards to their Origin, many lo&s;e them&s;elves in Antiquity.</P>
<P>They have indeed travelled down to us through a long Succe&s;&s;ion of Years, and the greate&s;t part of them, it is not improbable, will be of perpetual Ob&s;ervation: for the gene|rality of Men look back with &s;uper&s;titious Veneration on the Ages of their Forefathers: and Authorities, that are grey with Time, &s;eldom fail of commanding tho&s;e filial Honours, claimed even by the Appearance of hoary old Age.</P>
<P>Many of the&s;e it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed are mutilated, and, as in the Remains of antient Statuary, the Parts of not a few of them have been awkwardly tran&s;po&s;ed: they pre&s;erve, however, the principal <HI>Traits,</HI> that di&s;tingui&s;hed them in their origin.</P>
<P>Things, compo&s;ed of &s;uch flim&s;y Materials as the Fancies of a Multitude, do not &s;eem calculated for a long Du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tion; yet have the&s;e &s;urvived Shocks, by which even Empires have been overthrown, and pre&s;erved at lea&s;t &s;ome <HI>Form</HI> and <HI>Co|lour</HI> of Identity, during a Repetition of Changes, both in religious Opinions, and in the Polity of States.</P>
<P>But the &s;tronge&s;t Proof of their remote Antiquity, is&punc; that they have outlived the general Knowledge of the very Cau&s;es that gave ri&s;e to them.</P>
<P>The Reader will find in the &s;ub&s;equent pages an union of Endeavours to re&s;cue many of the&s;e Cau&s;es from Oblivion. If, on the Inve&s;tigation, they appear to any &s;o frivolous as not to have de&s;erved the Pains of the Search, the humble Labourers will avoid Cen&s;ure, by incurring Contempt.</P>
<P>How trivial &s;oever &s;uch an Enquiry may &s;eem to &s;ome, yet all mu&s;t be informed that it is attended with no &s;mall &s;hare of Difficulty and Toil.</P>
<P>A Pa&s;&s;age is to be forced through a Wilderne&s;s intricate and entangled: few Ve&s;tiges of former Labours can be found
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
to direct us; we mu&s;t oftentimes trace a tedious retro&s;pective Cour&s;e, perhaps to return at la&s;t weary and un&s;atisfied, from the making of Re&s;earches, fruitle&s;s as tho&s;e of &s;ome antient enthu&s;ia&s;tic Traveller, who ranging the barren <HI>African</HI> Sands, had in vain attempted to inve&s;tigate the hidden Sources of the <HI>Nile.</HI></P>
<P>Rugged and narrow as this Walk of Study may &s;eem to many, yet <HI>Fancy</HI> (who &s;hares with <HI>Hope</HI> the plea&s;ing Office of brightening a Pa&s;&s;age through every <HI>Route</HI> of human Endeavour) opens from hence too Pro&s;pects, enriched with the choice&s;t Beauties of her magic Creation.</P>
<P>The <HI>prime</HI> Origin of the &s;uper&s;titious Notions and Cere|monies of the People is ab&s;olutely unattainable; we de&s;pair of ever being able to reach the Fountain Head of Streams which have been running and increa&s;ing from the Beginning of Time. All that we a&s;pire to do, is only to trace back|wards, as far as po&s;&s;ible, the Cour&s;es of them on tho&s;e Charts, that remain, of the di&s;tant Countries from whence they were fir&s;t perceived to flow.</P>
<P>Few, who are de&s;irous of inve&s;tigating the popular No|tions and vulgar Ceremonies in our Nation, can fail of de|ducing them in their fir&s;t Direction from the Times when Popery was our e&s;tabli&s;hed Religion.</P>
<P>We &s;hall not wonder that the&s;e were able to &s;urvive the Reformation, when we con&s;ider, that though our &s;en&s;ible and &s;pirited Forefathers were, upon Conviction, ea&s;ily in|duced to forego religious Tenets, which had been weighed in the Balance, and &s;ound wanting; yet were <HI>the People</HI> by no means inclined to annihilate the &s;eemingly innocent Ceremo|nies of their former &s;uper&s;titious Faith.</P>
<P>The&s;e, con&s;ecrated to the Fancies of Men, by a U&s;age from Time immemorial, though crazed by public Authority from the <HI>written Word,</HI> were committed as a venerable De|po&s;it to the keeping of <HI>oral Tradition:</HI> like the <HI>Penates</HI> of a|nother <HI>Troy,</HI> recently de&s;troyed, they were religiou&s;ly brought off, after having been &s;natched out of the &s;moking Ruins of Popery.</P>
<P>It is not improbable that, in the Infancy of Prote&s;tanti&s;m, the continuance of many of the&s;e was connived at by the State. For Men, <Q>who are but Children of a larger
<PB N="v" REF="4">
Growth,</Q> are not weaned all at once, and the Refor|mation of Manners, and of Religion, is always mo&s;t &s;urely e&s;tabli&s;hed, when effected by &s;low Degrees, and as it were imperceptible Gradations.</P>
<P>Thus al&s;o at the fir&s;t Promulgation of Chri&s;tianity to the Gentile Nations, through the Force of Conviction they yielded indeed to Truth; yet they could not be per&s;uaded to relin|qui&s;h many of their Super&s;titions, which, rather than forego them altogether, they cho&s;e to blend and incorporate with their new Faith.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tian, or rather Papal Rome, borrowed her Rites, Notions, and Ceremonies, in the mo&s;t luxurious Abundance from an|cient and Heathen Rome; and much the greater Number of the&s;e flaunting Externals, which <HI>Infallibility</HI> has adopted, and u&s;ed as Feathers to adorn <HI>her Triple-Cap,</HI> have been &s;tolen out of the Wings of the <HI>dying Eagle.</HI></P>
<P>With regard to the Rites, Sports, &amp;c. of the Common People, I am aware that the moro&s;e and bigoted Part of Mankind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I &s;hall quote here the &s;ub&s;equent <HI>curious Thoughts</HI> on this Subject: the Puritans are ridiculed in them.</P>

Yet mu&s;t &s;uch be told that Shows and Sports have been countenanced by the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t of States; and though it cannot be denied that they have been &s;ometimes pro&s;tituted to the Purpo&s;es of Riot and Debauchery, yet were we to reprobate every thing that has been thus abu&s;ed, <HI>Religion</HI> it&s;elf could not be retained; perhaps we &s;hould be able to keep nothing.</P>
<P>The Common People, confined by daily Labour, &s;eem to require their proper Intervals of Relaxation; perhaps it is of
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
the highe&s;t political Utility to encourage innocent Sports and Games among them. The Revival of many of the&s;e, would, I think, be highly pertinent at this particular Sea&s;on, when the general Spread of Luxury and Di&s;&s;ipation threa|tens more than at any preceding Period to extingui&s;h the Character of our boa&s;ted national Bravery. For the Ob&s;erva|tion of an hone&s;t old Writer, Stow, (who tells us, &s;peaking of the May-games, Mid&s;ummer-Eve<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I call to mind here the plea&s;ing Account Mr. Sterne has left us in his Sentimental Journey, of the <HI>Grace-dance</HI> after Supper&mdash;I agree with that amiable Writer in thinking that <HI>Religion</HI> may mix her&s;elf in the Dance, and that innocent Cheerfulne&s;s is no incon&s;iderable Part of Devotion; &s;uch indeed as cannot fail of being grateful to the <HI>Good Being,</HI>&mdash;it is a <HI>&s;ilent</HI> but <HI>eloquent</HI> Mode of prai&s;ing him!</NOTE> Rejoicings, &amp;c. an|tiently u&s;ed in the Streets of London, <Q>which <HI>open</HI> Pa&s;times in my Youth being now &s;uppre&s;t, wor&s;e Practices <HI>within Doors</HI> are to be &s;eared),</Q> may be with &s;ingular propriety adopted on the mo&s;t tran&s;ient Survey of our pre&s;ent popular Manners.</P>
<P>Mr. Bourne, my Predece&s;&s;or in this Walk, has not, from whatever Cau&s;e, done Ju&s;tice to the Subject he undertook to treat of. Far from having the Vanity to think that I have exhau&s;ted it, the utmo&s;t of my Preten&s;ions is to the Merit of having endeavoured, by making Additions, to improve it. I think him, however, de&s;erving of no &s;mall Share of Prai&s;e for his imperfect Attempt, for "much is due to tho&s;e, who fir&s;t broke the Way to Knowledge, and left only to their Succe&s;&s;ors the Ta&s;k of &s;moothing it."</P>
<P>New Lights have ari&s;en &s;ince his Time. The Engli&s;h Antique has become a general and fa&s;hionable Study; and the Di&s;coveries of the very re&s;pectable Society of Antiquaries have rendered the Rece&s;&s;es of Papal and Heathen Antiquities ea&s;ier of acce&s;s.</P>
<P>I flatter my&s;elf I have turned all the&s;e Circum&s;tances in &s;ome mea&s;ure to Advantage. I have gleaned Pa&s;&s;ages that &s;eemed to throw Light upon the Subject, from a great Va|riety of Volumes, and tho&s;e written too in &s;everal Lan|guages; in the doing of which, if I &s;hall not be found to having de&s;erved the Prai&s;e of Judgment, I mu&s;t at lea&s;t make Preten&s;ions to the Merit of Indu&s;try,</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="6">Elegance of Compo&s;ition will hardly be expected in a Work of this Kind, which &s;tands much le&s;s in need of Attic Wit, than of Roman Per&s;everance, and <HI>Dutch</HI> A&s;&s;iduity.</P>
<P>I &s;hall offer &s;ome Di&s;coveries, which are peculiarly my own; for there are Cu&s;toms yet retained here in the North, of which I am per&s;uaded the learned of the Southern Part of the I&s;land have not heard, which is, perhaps, the &s;ole Cau&s;e why they have never before been inve&s;tigated.</P>
<P>In peru&s;ing the &s;ub&s;equent Ob&s;ervations, the candid Rea|der, who has never before con&s;idered this neglected Subject, is reque&s;ted not to be ra&s;h in pa&s;&s;ing Sentence, but to &s;u&s;pend his Judgment, at lea&s;t, till he has carefully examined all the Evidence; by which Caution I do not wi&s;h to have it under&s;tood, that our Determinations are thought to be in|fallible, or that every Deci&s;ion here is not amenable to an higher Authority. In the mean time Prejudice may be for|warned, and it will apologize for many &s;eemingly trivial Rea&s;ons, a&s;&s;igned for the beginning and tran&s;mitting of this or that <HI>Notion</HI> or <HI>Ceremony,</HI> to reflect, that what may appear fooli&s;h to the enlightened Under&s;tandings of Men in the <HI>Eighteenth</HI> Century, wore a very different A&s;pect when viewed through the Gloom that prevailed in the <HI>&s;eventh</HI> or <HI>eighth.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hould tre&s;pa&s;s upon the Patience of my Reader, were I to enumerate all the Books I have con&s;ulted on this Oc|ca&s;ion; to which, however, I &s;hall take Care in their proper Places to refer: but I own my&s;elf under particu|lar Obligations to <HI>Durand</HI>'s Ritual of Divine Offices; a Work inimical to every Idea of rational Wor&s;hip, but to the Enquirer into the Origin of our popular Ceremonies, an in|valuable Magazine of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting Intelligence. I would &s;tile this Performance the great <HI>Ceremonial Law</HI> of the Romani&s;ts, in Compari&s;on with which the <HI>Mo&s;aic Code</HI> is <HI>bar|ren</HI> of Rites and Ceremonies. We &s;tand amazed on peru&s;ing it at the enormous Weight of a new Yoke which <HI>Holy Church</HI> fabricating <HI>with her own Hands</HI> has impo&s;ed on her &s;ervile Devotees.</P>
<P>Yet the Forgers of the&s;e Shackles had artfully contrived to make them &s;it ea&s;y, by twi&s;ting Flowers around them. Dark as this Picture, drawn by the Pencil of gloomy Super|&s;tition,
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
appeared upon <HI>the whole,</HI> yet was its deep <HI>Shade</HI> contra&s;ted with plea&s;ing <HI>Lights.</HI></P>
<P>The Calendar was crowded with Red-Letter Days, nomi|nally indeed con&s;ecrated to <HI>Saints;</HI> but which, by the en|couragement of Idlene&s;s ond Di&s;&s;ipation of Manners, gave every kind of countenance to SINNERS.</P>
<P>A Profu&s;ion of childi&s;h Rites, Pageants and Ceremonies, diverted the Attention of the People from the con&s;ideration of their real State, and kept them in humour, if it did not &s;ometimes make them in love with their &s;lavi&s;h Modes of Wor&s;hip,</P>
<P>To the Credit of our &s;en&s;ible and manly Forefathers, they were among the fir&s;t who felt the Weight of this new and unnece&s;&s;ary Yoke, and had Spirit enough to throw it off.</P>
<P>I have fortunately in my Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion one of tho&s;e antient Romi&s;h Calendars of &s;ingular Curio&s;ity, which contains un|der the immoveable Fea&s;ts and Fa&s;ts, (I regret much its Silence on the moveable ones) a variety of brief Ob&s;ervations, contributing not a little to the elucidation of many of our popular Cu&s;toms, and proving them to have been &s;ent over from Rome, with <HI>Bulls, Indulgencies,</HI> and other Baubles, bartered, as it &s;hould &s;eem, for our <HI>Peter-pence,</HI> by tho&s;e who trafficked in &s;piritual Merchandize from the Continent.</P>
<P>The&s;e I &s;hall carefully tran&s;late (though in &s;ome Places it is extremely difficult to render the very barbarous <HI>Latin,</HI> of which I fear the Critic will think I have transfu&s;ed the Bar|barity, Brevity, and Ob&s;curity into my own <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>) and lay before my Reader, who will at once &s;ee and acknowledge their Utility.</P>
<P>A learned Performance, by a Doctor More&s;in in the Time of James I. and dedicated to that Monarch, is al&s;o luckily in my Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. It is written in Latin, and entitled "The Origin and Increa&s;e of Depravity in Religion;" containing a very ma&s;terly Parallel between the Rites, Notions, &amp;c. of <HI>Heathen</HI> and tho&s;e of <HI>Papal</HI> Rome.</P>
<P>The copious Extracts from this Work, with which I &s;hall adorn the &s;ub&s;equent Pages will be their own Eulogy, and &s;uper&s;ede my poor Encomiums.</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="8">When I call to remembrance the <HI>Poet of</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The late Mr. Grey.</NOTE> <HI>Humanity,</HI> who has tran&s;mitted his Name to Immortality, by Reflections writ|ten among the little Tomb-&s;tones of the Vulgar, in a Country Church-Yard; I am urged by no fal&s;e Shame to apologize for the &s;eeming Unimportance of my Subject.</P>
<P>The Antiquities of the Common People cannot be &s;tudied without acquiring &s;ome u&s;eful Knowledge of Mankind. By the chemical Proce&s;s of Philo&s;ophy, even Wi&s;dom may be extracted from the Follies and Super&s;titions of our Forefathers</P>
<P>The <HI>People,</HI> of whom Society is chiefly compo&s;ed, and for who&s;e good, Superiority of Rank is only a Grant made ori|ginally by mutual Conce&s;&s;ion, is a re&s;pectable Subject to every one who is the Friend of Man.</P>
<P>Pride, which, independent of the Idea ari&s;ing from the Nece&s;&s;ity of civil Polity, has portioned out the human <HI>Genus</HI> into &s;uch a variety of different and &s;ubordinate <HI>Species,</HI> mu&s;t be compelled to own, that the lowe&s;t of the&s;e derives it&s;elf from an Origin, common to it with the highe&s;t of the Kind. The beautiful Sentiment of <HI>Terence:</HI>
<Q>"<HI>Homo</HI> &s;um, <HI>humani</HI> nihil &aacute; me alienum puto."</Q>
may be adopted therefore in this Place, to per&s;uade us that nothing can be foreign to our Enquiry, which concerns the &s;malle&s;t of the Vulgar; of tho&s;e <HI>little ones,</HI> who occupy the lowe&s;t Place in the political Arrangement of human Beings.</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE following Sheets are a few of that va&s;t Number of <HI>Ceremonies</HI> and <HI>Opinions,</HI> which are held by the Common People; &s;uch, as they &s;olely or generally ob&s;erve. For tho' &s;ome of them have been of National and others perhaps of univer&s;al Ob&s;ervance, yet at pre&s;ent they would have little or no Being, if not ob|&s;erved among the Vulgar.</P>
<P>I would not be thought a Reviver of old Rites and Ceremonies to the Burdening of the People, nor an Aboli&s;her of innocent Cu&s;toms, which are their Plea&s;ures and Recreations: I aim at nothing, but a Regulation of tho&s;e which are in Being among&s;t them, which they them&s;elves are far from thinking burden&s;ome, and aboli|&s;hing &s;uch only as are &s;inful and wicked.</P>
<P>Some of the Cu&s;toms they hold, have been originally good, tho' at pre&s;ent they retain little of their primitive Purity; the true Meaning and De&s;ign of them, being either lo&s;t, or very much in the Dark through Folly and Super&s;tition. To wipe off therefore the Du&s;t they have contracted, to clear them of Super&s;tition, and make known their End and De&s;ign, may turn to &s;ome Account, and be of Advantage; whereas ob&s;erving them in the
<PB N="xvii" REF="14">
pre&s;ent Way, is not only of no Advantage, but of very great Detriment.</P>
<P>Others they hold, are really &s;inful, notwith&s;tanding in outward Appearance they &s;eem very harmle&s;s, being a Scandal to Religion, and an encouraging of Wicked|ne&s;s. And therefore to aim at aboli&s;hing the&s;e, will I hope be no Crime, tho' they be the Diver&s;ions of the People.</P>
<P>As to the Opinions they hold, they are almo&s;t all &s;u|per&s;titious, being generally either the Produce of Hea|theni&s;m; or the Inventions of indolent <HI>Monks,</HI> who having nothing el&s;e to do, were the Forgers of many &s;illy and wicked Opinions, to keep the World in Awe and Ignorance. And indeed the ignorant Part of the World, is &s;o &s;till aw'd, that they follow the idle Tradi|tions of the one, more than the Word of GOD; and have more Dependance upon the lucky Omens of the other than his Providence, more Dread of their un|lucky ones, than his Wrath and Puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>The regulating therefore of the&s;e Opinions and Cu&s;|toms, is what I propos'd by the following Compo&s;itions, whatever has been &s;ugge&s;ted to the contrary: And as to the Menaces of &s;ome, and the Cen&s;ures of others, I neither fear nor regard them. I &s;hall be always ready to own any Mi&s;take, and in what I ju&s;tly may, to vindicate my&s;elf.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of the Soul-Bell, its Antiquity, the Rea&s;on of its In&s;titution, the Benefit and Advantage of it, an Exhortation to the U&s;e of it according to its fir&s;t In&s;titution.</HEAD>
<P>THE Ceremony of tolling the Bell at the Time of Death, &s;eems to be as ancient as the having of Bells them|&s;elves; we are told,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Bingham</HI>'s Orig. Eccl. Lib. 3.</NOTE> it was about the &s;eventh Century when Bells were fir&s;t in the Church, and that venerable <HI>Bede</HI> is the fir&s;t that men|tions them. If this be true, then it is as true, that the tolling of the Bell was in&s;tituted about that Time; for where our Countryman
<PB N="2" REF="20">
mentions the Word <HI>Campana,</HI> or Bell, there it al&s;o is, that we find a Bell made u&s;e of for the Dead:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Haec, tunc in dormitorio &s;ororum pau&s;ans, exaudivit &s;ubito in aere notum campanae &s;onum, quo ad orationes ex|citari vel convocari &s;olebant, cum quis eorum de &s;eculo fui&s;&s;et evocatus. <HI>Bed. Eccl. Hi&s;t Lib.</HI> 4. <HI>Cap.</HI> 23.</NOTE> For at the Death of the Abbe&s;s St. <HI>Hilda,</HI> he tells us that one of the Si&s;ters of a di&s;tant Mona&s;tery, as &s;he was &s;leeping, thought &s;he heard the well-known Sound of that Bell, which called them to Prayers, when any of them had departed this Life. But be that as it will, it is evident that the Bell was tolled upon this Occa&s;ion about <HI>Bede</HI>'s Time, and con&s;equently that the Ceremony is as an|cient as his Days.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;on why this cu&s;tom was in&s;tituted, was not, as &s;ome &s;eem to imagine, for no other End than to acquaint the Neighbourhood, that &s;uch a Per&s;on was dead; but chiefly, that whoever heard the Noi&s;e of the Bell, &s;hould put up their Prayers for the Soul: Thus the Father above-mentioned tells us again,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Quod cum illa audi&s;&s;et, &s;u&s;citavit cunctas &s;orores &amp; in eccle&s;iam convocatas, orationibus &amp; p&s;almis pro anima matris operam dare monuit. <HI>Ibid.</HI></NOTE> That &s;he who pre&s;ided in this Mona&s;tery, had no &s;ooner heard this, than &s;he rai&s;ed all the Si&s;|ters, and called them into the Church, where &s;he exhorted them to pray fervently, and &s;ing a <HI>Requiem</HI> for the Soul of their Mother. <HI>Ca&s;|&s;alion</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="21">
al&s;o upon this Place of <HI>Bede,</HI> &s;ays, <HI>That</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Et talis ritus etiam de prae&s;enti &s;ervatur in <HI>Anglia,</HI> ut cum quis dece&s;&s;it, &s;tatim campana propriae illius Parochiae &s;peciali quodam modo &s;onat per aliquod temporis &s;patium.&mdash; Quamvis <HI>Angli</HI> negent modo orationes &amp; &s;uffragia defunctis proficua; non aliam tamen in hoc ab illis rationem potui per|cipere, quam quod talis &s;onus &s;it ritus antiquae eccle&s;iae <HI>An|glicanae, Ca&s;&s;ali</HI> de vet Sac, Chri&s;t. Rit. P. 241.</NOTE> <HI>the &s;ame Cu&s;tom is &s;till ob&s;erved in</HI> England, <HI>that as &s;oon as any hath departed this Life, the Bell belonging to the Pari&s;h he liv'd in, was imme|diately tolled, and for &s;ome Time.&mdash;And though</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>now deny, that Prayers are of any Service to the Dead; yet I could meet with no other Account of this Ceremony, than that it was a Cu&s;tom of the old Church of</HI> Eng|land.</P>
<P>And for this Rea&s;on it is, that this Cu&s;tom was fir&s;t ob&s;erved, and &s;hould be &s;till retained among us, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Prayers of the Faith|ful may be a&s;&s;i&s;ting to the Soul; and certainly it might be more profitably retained, were it &s;o ordered, that the Bell &s;hould be tolled be|fore the Per&s;on's Departure, as was undoubtedly de&s;igned when this Ceremony was continued, that good men might give him their Prayers. Was this always &s;o ob&s;erved, there might be &s;ome <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> among&s;t the Number of the Faith|ful, who&s;e Prayers could prevail upon God to beat back <HI>the Amalekites of Darkne&s;s;</HI> &s;ome who&s;e <HI>Faith</HI> might remove a <HI>Mountain of Sins,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="22">
and &s;ome who&s;e Tears procure a Multitude of Mercies. O the Comfort of <HI>the Forgivene&s;s of Sins!</HI> Of <HI>being guided &s;afely through the Sha|dow of Death!</HI> Of arriving &s;ecurely at the heavenly Country! What is it that Prayer can't obtain?</P>
<P>But though the Wickedne&s;s and Impeni|tency of the dying Per&s;on be &s;uch, as that the Prayers of the Faithful will not be &s;uffi|cient to avert the Wrath and Puni&s;hment of a ju&s;tly incen&s;ed God; yet as this can be only known to God, it will not di&s;charge Men from recommending him to the Divine Mercy, in the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate and affectionate Manner. They thereby expre&s;s the mo&s;t laudable Zeal, the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted Charity; and whil&s;t they are &s;o &s;olicitous for the Happine&s;s and Welfare of other Men's Souls, they cannot but be thereby influenced to have the greate&s;t Con|cern for their own, and be both encouraged and directed to proceed with an holy Emula|tion <HI>from Strength to Strength,</HI> and endeavour as the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. vi. 1.</NOTE> Apo&s;tle advi&s;es, <HI>to go on to Perfection.</HI></P>
<P>But, alas! we are fallen into Times of &s;uch Irreligion and Prejudice, &s;uch Contempt of An|tiquity, and &s;uch too great Reformation, that what with Indolence on one Hand, and Igno|rance on the other; what with no Zeal on this
<PB N="5" REF="23">
Side, and too<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Among the many Objections of the <HI>Browni&s;ts,</HI> it is laid to the Charge of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> that though we deny the Doctrine of Purgatory, and teach the contrary, yet how well our Practice &s;uits with it, may be con&s;idered in our ringing of hal|lowed Bells for the Soul. Bi&s;h. <HI>Hall.</HI> cont. <HI>Brown.</HI></NOTE> fal&s;e a one on that; we either neglect the mo&s;t decent Ceremonies of Reli|gion, or we think it is Religion to have no Ceremonies at all. No Wonder then, that, <HI>in the Mid&s;t of &s;uch a crooked and perver&s;e Genera|tion,</HI> when the mo&s;t of Men are negligent of them&s;elves, they are al&s;o negligent of others: No Wonder, that when there is &s;uch a ge|neral Contempt of Religion, and Men are care|le&s;s of their own Souls, they are not careful for the Souls of their Friends.</P>
<P>But it is called<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>In a Ve&s;try-Book belonging to the Chapel of</HI> All-Saints, <HI>in</HI> Newca&s;tle upon Tyne, <HI>it is ob&s;ervable, That the Tolling of the Bell is not mentioned in the Pari&s;h Accounts, from the Year</HI> 1643, <HI>till</HI> 1655, <HI>when we find it ordered to be tolled again. At a Ve&s;try holden</HI> January 21&s;t, 1655. Whereas for &s;ome Years pa&s;t, the collecting of the Duty for Bell and Tolling, hath been forborn and laid a&s;ide, which hath much le&s;&s;ened the Revenue of the Church, by which, and &s;uch-like Means, it is brought into Dilapidations; and having now taken the &s;ame into &s;erious Con&s;ideration, and fully debated the Ob|jections made by &s;ome again&s;t the &s;ame, and having had the Judgment of our Mini&s;ters concerning any Super&s;tition that might be in it; which being made clear, it is this Day or|dered, That from henceforth, the Church Officer appointed thereunto, do collect the &s;ame, and bring the Money unto the Church-Wardens, and that tho&s;e who de&s;ire to have the U&s;e of the Bells, may freely have them as formerly, paying the accu&s;tomed Fees. <HI>It is certain they laid it a&s;ide, becau&s;e they thought it &s;uper&s;titious, and it is probable, if they had not wanted Money, they had not &s;een the contrary.</HI></NOTE> Popi&s;h and Super&s;titious; for what true Rea&s;on, I know not. Did we
<PB N="6" REF="24">
indeed imagine with the Papi&s;ts, that there is any<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We call them Soul-Bells, for that they &s;ignifie the Depar|ture of the Soul, not for that they help the Pa&s;&s;age of the Soul. Bi&s;h. <HI>Hall</HI> cont. <HI>Brown,</HI> P. <HI>568.</HI></NOTE> Virtue or extraordinary Power in a Bell, that it is<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Item ut Daemones tinnitu campanarum, Chri&s;tianos ad preces concitantium, terreantur.

C.</HI> 22. <HI>S.</HI> 6.</NOTE> hallowed by Bapti&s;m, and drives away the Spirits of Darkne&s;s, then it might ju&s;tly be called Super&s;tition, and therefore ju&s;t|ly aboli&s;hed. But when we retain the Cu&s;tom, only to procure the Prayers of the Faithful for a departing Soul, it would &s;urely be of Advan|tage to ob&s;erve it, if the <HI>Prayers of a righteous Man avail</HI> any Thing at all; which, if we may believe an in&s;pired Apo&s;tle, are of very great Efficacy and Validity.</P>
<P>Art thou then attending a Friend in his la&s;t Moments? Art thou careful for his Soul, and &s;olicitous for his Salvation? Do&s;t thou wi&s;h him &s;afe <HI>through the Valley of Death to the ever|la&s;ting Hills?</HI> Would&s;t thou have the good An|gels protect him, and be his <HI>Shield again&s;t the Powers of Darkne&s;s?</HI> In &s;hort, would&s;t thou have him crown'd with the Joys of <HI>Paradi&s;e?</HI> Be a&s;&s;ured then, that the Prayers of good men
<PB N="7" REF="25">
will very much contribute to the gaining of the&s;e Things. But how &s;hall they then pray for him, if they know not of his Departure? And how can they know that, without the tolling of the Bell? Do thou therefore put in Practice this decent and profitable Cu&s;tom, not as our Age generally does, after the Death of thy Friend, but before it; before he leave the World, when the Prayers of good Men can a&s;&s;i&s;t him, and facilitate his Journey into the other Life.</P>
<P>Or, art thou <HI>working in the Field, or grind|ing at the Mill?</HI> Remember then, when thou heare&s;t the Sound of the Bell for one depart|ing, that thou put up thy Prayers for him. Be thy Bu&s;ine&s;s what it will, it will always permit thee to &s;ay at lea&s;t, <HI>LORD, now lette&s;t thou thy Servant depart in Peace:</HI> Or to u&s;e the Words of St. <HI>O&s;wald,</HI> when he and his Sol|diers were ready to be &s;lain, <HI>Lord, have Mercy on the Soul of thy</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Oravit ad dominum pro animabus exercitus &s;ui. Unde dicunt in proverbio, Deus mi&s;erere animabus, dixit <HI>O&s;waldus</HI> cadens in terram, <HI>Bed. Eccl. L.</HI> 3. <HI>C.</HI> 12. <HI>It is u&s;ed</HI> (&s;ays <HI>Bede</HI>) <HI>even to a Proverb,</HI> That he died praying; <HI>for when the Enemy had &s;urrounded him, and he &s;aw him&s;elf about to be &s;lain, he prayed unto the LORD for the Souls of his Army. Hence it is that the Proverb comes,</HI> LORD, have Mercy upon the Soul, as St. <HI>O&s;wald</HI> &s;aid when he fell to the Earth. <HI>Which Proverb, in all Probability, hath been the Original of this pre|&s;ent national Saying,</HI>
<Q><L>When the Bell begins to toll,</L>
<L>LORD, have Mercy on the Soul.</L></Q></NOTE> <HI>Servant.</HI> It will not be
<PB N="8" REF="26">
long, till thou thy&s;elf &s;halt have Occa&s;ion for &s;uch Prayers, till thou come to die, and enter on thy Journey to the other State: If then <HI>thou ha&s;t been merciful, thou &s;halt obtain Mercy;</HI> if by thy Prayers thou ha&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Souls of thy Brethren, thou &s;halt either be remem|bered in the Prayers of good Men, or &s;urely the&s;e thy Prayers for others will be of Service to thy&s;elf al&s;o, at that dreadful hour.</P>
<P>But now it may be objected, That as the Bell is &s;eldom tolled till after the Per&s;on's De|parture, it is to no Purpo&s;e to pray for the Soul; nay to pray for it, would be praying for the Dead: And &s;ince that is repugnant to the Doctrine of our Church, our Prayers at that Time had much better be omitted.</P>
<P>Indeed it is too true, this Cu&s;tom is not &s;o common as it &s;hould be; but however, it is &s;o much ob&s;erved, as will be able to vindicate the putting up of con&s;tant Prayers. I know &s;everal religious Families in this Place, and I hope it is &s;o in other Places too, who always ob&s;erve it, whenever the melancholy Sea&s;on offers; and therefore it will at lea&s;t &s;ometimes happen, when we put up our Prayers con&s;tantly at the tolling of the Bell, that we &s;hall pray for a Soul departing. And tho' it be granted, that it will oftener happen otherwi&s;e, as the regular Cu&s;tom is &s;o little followed; yet that can be no harmful praying for the Dead. We
<PB N="9" REF="27">
believe that the Soul is but departing, and it is charitably done to offer up our Prayers: And therefore when it proves otherwi&s;e, <HI>our</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm xxxiv. 14.</NOTE> <HI>Prayer &s;hall turn into our own Bo&s;om;</HI> and like as that Peace, which the Di&s;ciples wi&s;hed to an unworthy Hou&s;e, returned to the Di&s;ciples again; &s;o, though our Prayers at that Time may be of no Service to the Soul, yet they will be of no Di&s;&s;ervice to us. They will re|turn to us again, but it will be no Fault to have mi&s;placed them.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Author &s;eems of Opinion, that the Ce|remony of tolling a Bell<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;ub&s;equent Etymology of this Word has the Sanction of the learned Sir Henry Spelman: <HI>Bell</HI> is derived from <HI>Pelvis,</HI> a Ba&s;on: for before the Invention of Bells, not only <HI>&s;ounding Bra&s;s,</HI> but <HI>Ba&s;ons</HI> al&s;o were u&s;ed in&s;tead of them. (Hou&s;ewives to this Day try the Soundne&s;s of their Earthen or China Va&s;es by <HI>ringing</HI> them with a Finger). Vide Lye's Junii Etymolog. in verbo.&mdash; Mr Wheatley, in his Illu&s;tration of the Liturgy, apologizes for our retaining this Ceremony. <Q>Our Church (&s;ays he) in Imita|tion of the Saints in former Ages, calls in the Mini&s;ter and others, who are at hand, to a&s;&s;i&s;t their Brother in his la&s;t Ex|tremity. In order to this &s;he directs that when any one is <HI>pa&s;&s;ing</HI> out of this Life, a Bell &s;hould be tolled, &amp;c.</Q> It is called from thence the <HI>Pa&s;&s;ing Bell.</HI></NOTE> at the Time of Death, is as antient as the U&s;e of Bells. This is &s;omewhat improbable. It has rather been an After-Invention of Super&s;tition. Thus praying for the <HI>Dying</HI> was <HI>improved upon</HI> into praying for the <HI>Dead.</HI> Bells mu&s;t have been fir&s;t u&s;ed as Signals to con|vene the People to their public Devotions.</P>

Truly my Hope is even in Thee. Deliver me from all mine Offences, and O &s;pare me a little that I may recover my Strength, before I go hence and be no more &s;een.</HI> Such Thoughts as the&s;e of our Friend's, and of our own Mortality, would excite us to pre|pare for our own Change.</P>
<P>And as this Form of Proce&s;&s;ion is an Em|blem of our dying &s;hortly after our Friend, &s;o the carrying of Ivy, or Laurel, or Ro&s;emary, or &s;ome of tho&s;e Ever-Greens, is an Emblem of the Soul's Immortality. It is as much as
<PB N="30" REF="48">
to &s;ay, That though the Body be dead, yet the Soul is Ever-Green and always in Life: It is not like the Body, and tho&s;e other Greens which die and revive again at their proper Sea&s;ons, no <HI>Autumn</HI> nor <HI>Winter</HI> can make a Change in it, but it is unalterably the &s;ame, perpetually in Life, and never dying.</P>
<P>The <HI>Romans,</HI> and other Heathens upon this Occa&s;ion, made U&s;e of Cypre&s;s, which being once cut, will never flouri&s;h nor grow any more, as an Emblem of their dying for ever, and being no more in Life.

For though, as to the Body they die to the World, yet, as to their Souls, they live to GOD.</P>
<P>And as the carrying of the&s;e Ever-Greens is an Emblem of the Soul's Immortality, &s;o it is al&s;o of the Re&s;urrection of the Body: For as the&s;e Herbs are not entirely pluck'd up, but only cut down, and will, at the returning Sea&s;on, revive and &s;pring up again; &s;o the Body, like them, is but cut down for a while,
<PB N="31" REF="49">
and will ri&s;e and &s;hoot up again at the Re&s;ur|rection. For, as the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> &s;ays,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. lxiii. 14.</NOTE> <HI>Our Bones &s;hall flouri&s;h like an Herb.</HI></P>
<P>It was cu&s;tomary<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Greg.

Thus by the&s;e two antient Ceremonies, we have placed before our Eyes, our Mortality and Immortality; the one &s;peaks the Death of the Body, the other the Life of the Soul, nay, and the Life of the Body too; for like that Herb we carry, it is not quite pluck'd up, but &s;hall one Day be alive again. When it hath laid in the Earth the <HI>Winter</HI> Sea&s;on, the Continuance of this World, and the Warmth and Influence of the <HI>Spring</HI> is come, the joyful Spring of the Re|&s;urrection, it &s;hall be enliven'd, and &s;hoot up, and eternally flouri&s;h.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cor. i. 15.</NOTE> <HI>For this Corruptible mu&s;t put on Incorruption, and this Mortal mu&s;t put on Immortality.

<P><PB N="32" REF="50">There is another Cu&s;tom u&s;ed in &s;ome Places, at the Proce&s;&s;ion of Funerals, which pays a due Honour to the Dead, and gives Comfort and Con&s;olation to the Living; and that is, the carrying out the Dead with P&s;almody. This was an antient Cu&s;tom of the Church; for in &s;ome of the earlie&s;t Ages, they carried out their Dead to the Grave with &s;inging of P&s;alms and Hymns.

<PB N="33" REF="51">
Honour to the Body! How is it imitating the ble&s;&s;ed Angels, who rejoyced at Meeting of the Soul, and carrying it to Heaven.

<P>When therefore we attend the Corps of a Neighbour or Relation, and this decent Cere|mony is perform'd, let it al&s;o have a Share of our Thoughts, and excite in us Joy and Com|fort, and Thank&s;giving and Prai&s;e.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of Garlands in Country Churches: Of &s;trawing Flowers on the Grave; the Antiquity of the&s;e Cu&s;toms, the Innocency of them.</HEAD>
<P>IN &s;ome Country Churches 'tis cu&s;tomary, to hang <HI>a Garland of Flowers</HI> over the Seats of <HI>decea&s;ed Virgins,</HI> as a Token of E&s;teem and Love, and an Emblem of their Reward in the heavenly Church.</P>
<P>This Cu&s;tom perhaps may be look'd upon, as &s;prung from that ancient Cu&s;tom of the Heathens, of <HI>crowning</HI> their <HI>Corps,</HI> with <HI>Gar|lands</HI> in Token of Victory. But Mr. <HI>Bingham</HI> tells us, That we find not this Cu&s;tom u&s;ed by the <HI>Ancients</HI> in their <HI>Funeral Rites.</HI> For as he ob&s;erves, the Heathen in <HI>Minutius</HI> makes it one Topick of Accu&s;ation again&s;t them,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Min. P.</HI> 35. Coronas etiam &s;epulchris denegatis. <HI>Bing. Vol.</HI> 10. <HI>P.</HI> 68.</NOTE> That they did not crown their Sepulchres.</P>
<P>But if they did not crown them after the Manner of the Heathens, they had a Cu&s;tom of u&s;ing Crowns of Flowers, if we may believe <HI>Ca&s;&s;alion,</HI> who tells us,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Euit quoque mos ad capita virginum apponendi &s;lorum coronas, <HI>&amp;c. Ca&s;&s;. de Vet. Sacr. Chri&s;t. P.</HI> 334.</NOTE> It was a Cu&s;tom of the ancient Chri&s;tians to place Crowns of
<PB N="40" REF="58">
Flowers, at the Heads of decea&s;ed Virgins; for which he quotes <HI>Dama&s;cen, Gregory Ny&s;&s;en,</HI> St. <HI>Jerom</HI> and St. <HI>Au&s;tin.</HI> And this hath pro|bably been the Original of this Cu&s;tom among the Vulgar.</P>
<P>That other Cu&s;tom of <HI>&s;trawing Flowers</HI> up|on the <HI>Graves</HI> of their departed Friends, is al&s;o derived from a Cu&s;tom of the ancient Church. For it was u&s;ual in tho&s;e Times for the common Sort of People, to &s;traw the Graves of their Friends with various Flowers. Of this there are two notable In&s;tances taken No|tice of by <HI>Ca&s;&s;alion,</HI> and &s;everal other Rituali&s;ts. The one is that of St. <HI>Ambro&s;e,</HI> in his <HI>Funeral Oration</HI> on the Death of <HI>Valentinian,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nec ego floribus tumulum ejus a&s;peragam, &s;ed &s;piritum ejus Chri&s;ti odore perfundam; &s;pargant alii plenis lilia cala|this: Nobis lilium e&s;t Chri&s;tus: Hoc reliquias ejus &s;acrabo. <HI>Ambro&s; Orat.

<P>The other is that of St. <HI>Jerom,</HI> in his E|pi&s;tle to <HI>Pammachius</HI> upon the Death of his Wife.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Caeteri mariti &s;uper tumulos conjugum &s;pargunt violas, ro&s;as, lilia, flore&s;que purpureos, &amp; dolorem pectoris his o&s;fi|ciis con&s;olantur; <HI>Pammachius</HI> no&s;ter &s;anctum favillam o&s;&s;aque veneranda eleemo&s;ynae bal&s;amis rigat. <HI>Hieron.

<P>Now the&s;e In&s;tances, tho' they ju&s;tly com|mend the&s;e other Actions, and wi&s;ely prefer them to the Ceremonies of adorning Graves with Flowers, yet they no Way decry the&s;e ancient Cu&s;toms. The&s;e lower Marks of E&s;|teem and Honour, which the <HI>Vulgar</HI> paid to the Remains of their Friends, were in them|&s;elves harmle&s;s and innocent, and had no Cen&s;ure; and as they were &s;o, &s;o &s;hould the pre&s;ent Cu&s;toms be without any, being full as harmle&s;s and innocent as the other.</P>

<P>Our learned Countryman <HI>Gregory</HI> tells us, <Q>That the holy Men of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> hold a Tra|dition generally received from their Ancients, that our SAVIOUR him&s;elf was buried with his Face and Feet towards the Ea&s;t.</Q> It is affirmed by the Geographers of the holy Land.

the Days of <HI>Solon,</HI> who, as they report, con|vinced the <HI>Athenians,</HI> that the I&s;land of <HI>Sa|lamis</HI> did of Right belong to them, by &s;hew|ing them dead Bodies looking that Way, and Sepulchres turned towards the Ea&s;t, as they u&s;ed to bury. <HI>Diog.

<P>No Doubt but this learned Man had great Rea&s;on for this Conclu&s;ion, as well knowing that this ancient Rite was &s;truck at by the whole Herd of Sectaries, as a filly Fancy and an idle Dream: Who never would ob&s;erve it, were it not that they are &s;ometimes obliged; but would with tho&s;e who are not obliged, act the very Rever&s;e, and bury North and South.

But as long as this Ceremony is in Being, it will always be a ready Proof, that the whole Chri&s;tian Church did not only believe the Re&s;urrection of the Body, but of that very Body which was laid down in the Grave. For they ob&s;erved it, that they might be ready with their Faces to meet their SAVIOUR at his coming to Judgment, which certainly implies that they believed that very Body &s;hould ri&s;e again.</P>

<P>IT is a received Tradition among the Vul|gar, That at the Time of Cock-crowing, the Midnight Spirits for&s;ake the&s;e lower Re|gions, and go to their proper Places. They wander, &s;ay they, about the World, from the dead Hour of Night, when all Things are bu|ried in Sleep and Darkne&s;s, till the Time of Cock-crowing, and then they depart. Hence it is, that in Country-Places, where the Way of Life requires more early Labour, they al|ways go chearfully to Work at that Time; whereas if they are called abroad &s;ooner, they are apt to imagine every Thing they &s;ee or hear, to be a wandring Gho&s;t. <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> hath given us an excellent Account of this vulgar Notion, in his Tragedy of <HI>Hamlet.</HI></P>

<L>And then, they &s;ay, No Spirit doth walk abroad,</L>
<L>The Nights are whol&s;ome, then no Planet &s;trikes,</L>
<L>No Fairy takes, no Witch hath Power to harm,</L>
<L>So gracious and &s;o hallowed is that Time.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>Now to &s;hew what Truth there is in this vulgar Opinion, I &s;hall con&s;ider, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> What Truth there is in the Roaming of Spirits in the Night. And, <HI>Secondly,</HI> Whether they are ob|liged to go away at Cock-crow.</P>
<P>I believe none who a&s;&s;ent to the Truth of Divine Revelation, deny that there are good and evil Angels attending upon Men; the one to guard and protect them, and the other to harm and work their Ruin; that the one are tho&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. i. 14.</NOTE> <HI>mini&s;tring Spirits, which are &s;ent out to mini&s;ter to the Heirs of Salvation;</HI> the other the <HI>roaring Lion,</HI> and his In&s;truments,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Job. ii. 2.</NOTE> <HI>who wander too and fro in the Earth; the&s;e</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matt. xii. 43.</NOTE> <HI>un|clean Spirits who wander through dry Places, &s;eeking Re&s;t and finding none.</HI></P>
<P>NOR, I believe, will it be que&s;tion'd, that there have been Apparitions of good and evil Spirits, and that many, with our SAVIOUR'S
<PB N="56" REF="74">
Di&s;ciples, have been <HI>affrighted and cried out,</HI> not only with &s;uppo&s;ing they had &s;een, but really with &s;eeing a Spirit. Of this the Te&s;ti|mony of all Ages, and Scripture it &s;elf are a &s;ufficient Demon&s;tration.</P>
<P>What then could the&s;e have ordinarily been, but the Appearances of &s;ome of tho&s;e <HI>Angels</HI> of <HI>Light,</HI> or Darkne&s;s? For I am far from thinking that either the Gho&s;ts of the Damn'd or the Happy, either the Soul of a <HI>Dives</HI> or a <HI>Lazarus,</HI> returns here any more. For as <HI>St. Athana&s;ius</HI> ob&s;erves,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hai en tois naois, <HI>&amp;c. Athan.</HI> Tom. 2. P. 34.</NOTE> <HI>The&s;e Vi&s;ions and Shades of the Saints, which appear in the Temples and at the Tombs, are not the Souls of the Saints them&s;elves, but the good Angels appearing in their Shapes.</HI> Not that GOD could not remand the Gho&s;t of <HI>Samuel,</HI> and order it again to vi&s;it the Earth, as he made <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Elias</HI> to ap|pear at our SAVIOUR'S Transfiguration; but that a Thing of this Nature was very uncom|mon, and &s;eldom happen'd.</P>
<P>Taking it therefore for granted, that there have been Apparitions of Angels, I believe it will al&s;o be owned, that the&s;e Apparitions have frequently happen'd in the Night. And truly, was there no direct Proof of this, yet the No|tion of their appearing in the Night, being as it were link'd and chained to our Idea of an
<PB N="57" REF="75">
Apparition, would almo&s;t per&s;wade us, that the Night is the mo&s;t proper Time for &s;uch Appearances. Whether it is, that the Fables of Nur&s;es,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lock,</HI> on Human Under&s;t.</NOTE> as an ingenious Author imagines, <Q>have &s;o a&s;&s;ociated the Idea of Spirit to the Night, that the one never appears with|out the other;</Q> or whether there is &s;ome|thing in the Pre&s;ence of Night, &s;ome Awful|ne&s;s and Horrour, which naturally di&s;po&s;e the Mind of Man to the&s;e Reflections. I am indeed very inclinable to believe, that the&s;e Legendary Stories of Nur&s;es and old Women, are the Occa&s;ion of much greater Fears, than People without them, would generally have of the&s;e Things; but I cannot help thinking, that the Pre&s;ence of Night, would naturally lead a Man to &s;ome Reflection of Spirits, without any &s;uch Cau&s;e as that learned Author men|tions. There are &s;ome particular Times, which will naturally rai&s;e &s;ome particular Thoughts: Thus on a bright &s;unny Day we are naturally di&s;po&s;ed to Mirth and Gaiety; when the Day over-ca&s;ts, or the Weather is hazy, we then turn indolent and dull, and &s;ooth our &s;elves in Melancholly; if it Thunder and Lighten, we think of the Day of Judgment and &s;udden Death: And thus al&s;o the Night, as it inclines us to grave and &s;erious Thoughts, rai&s;es in us
<PB N="58" REF="76">
Horrour and Di&s;may, and makes us afraid, even when our Judgment tells us there is no Fear; &s;o it may of it &s;elf be look'd upon as a natural Cau&s;e of &s;uch Reflections.</P>
<P>But however this be, we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily own, that Spirits have frequently appeared in the Night, or we mu&s;t give the Lye to the Traditions of all Ages, to Hi&s;torians prophane and &s;acred, and the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t in the Ge|nerations of Men.</P>
<P>In the Heathen World there are many In|&s;tances, of which I &s;hall only mention this one out of <HI>Plutarch:</HI> <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Vit. Mar. <HI>Brut.</HI> Tran&s;.

<P>But though it be true from Scripture, that there have been nightly Apparitions, yet the&s;e are chiefly of good Angels; whereas this Opi|nion principally means, the Appearances of evil Spirits. It mu&s;t be owned indeed, that the Appearances of evil Spirits, if litterally, are yet but very &s;eldom mention'd in the Night in Scripture; but however, that they wander and appear at Night, is very deducible from, if not litterally mentioned in it. Their's <HI>is the Land of Darkne&s;s, and the Shadow of Death; They are re&s;erved under Chains of Darkne&s;s to the Judgment of the great Day; and we know that every one that doth Evil naturally hateth the Light: They therefore love Darkne&s;s rather than Light, becau&s;e their Deeds are Evil.</HI> The Night therefore, in a more e&s;pecial Manner, &s;eems to be their <HI>Hour,</HI> and the <HI>Power of Darkne&s;s.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Ca&s;&s;ian</HI> al&s;o, who lived in the &s;ame Century, giving an Account of a Multitude of Devils, who had been Abroad in the Night, &s;ays,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aurora itaque &s;uperveniente, cum omnis haec ab oculis evani&s;&s;et Daemonum multitudo. <HI>Ca&s;&s;.</HI> Coll. 8. C. 16.</NOTE> That as &s;oon as the Morn approached, they all vani&s;hed and fled away. By this we &s;ee, that this was a current Opinion at this Time of Day; but what Rea&s;on they had for it, ex|cept &s;ome Relations of the di&s;appearing of Evil Spirits at that Hour, I never yet have met with: But there have been produc'd at that Time of Night, Things of very memora|ble Worth, which might perhaps rai&s;e the pious Credulity of &s;ome Men to imagine, that there was &s;omething more in it, than in other Times. It was about the Time of Cock-crow|ing when our Saviour was born, and the An|gels &s;ung the fir&s;t Chri&s;tmas-Carol to the poor Shepherds, in the Fields of <HI>Bethlehem.</HI> Now
<PB N="64" REF="82">
it may be pre&s;um'd, that as the Saviour of the World was then born, and the <HI>heavenly Ho&s;t</HI> had then de&s;cended to proclaim the News, that the Angels of Darkne&s;s would be terrified and confounded, and immediately fly away: And perhaps this Con&s;ideration has partly been the Foundation of this Opinion; for as this may ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed, &s;o perhaps it has been ima|gin'd, that the Spirits of Darkne&s;s, having al|ways in Memory that fatal Hour, are &s;tartled and frighted away as the Cock proclaims it.</P>
<P>It was al&s;o about this Time when he ro&s;e from the Dead. And when the great <HI>Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> was ri&s;en upon the World, no Wonder that all the Clouds of Darkne&s;s and Wickedne&s;s were di&s;pell'd; no Wonder that the conquer'd Powers of Hell were not able to &s;hew their Heads: And this perhaps hath been another Rea&s;on of their imagining that Spi|rits go away at that Time.</P>
<P>A third Rea&s;on is, that Pa&s;&s;age in the Book of <HI>Gene&s;is,</HI> where Jacob <HI>wre&s;tled with the Angel for a Ble&s;&s;ing;</HI> where the Angel &s;ays unto him,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. xxxii.</NOTE> <HI>Let me go, for the Day breaketh.</HI></P>
<P>But indeed this Tradition &s;eems more e&s;pe|cially to have ri&s;en from &s;ome particular Cir|cum&s;tances attending the Time of Cock-crow|ing; and which, as <HI>Prudentius</HI> &s;eems to &s;ay
<PB N="65" REF="83">
above, are an Emblem of the Approach of the Day of the Re&s;urrection. For when we leave the World, we lie down in our Graves, and <HI>Re&s;t from our Labours:</HI> Sleep and Darkne&s;s lay hold upon us, and there we abide till the la&s;t Day appear, when the Voice of the Arch-Angel &s;hall awake us, that we may meet the LORD of Light and Day. And when we leave the common Bu&s;ine&s;s and Care of Life, we lie down in our Beds, as in a Grave, buried as it were in Sleep and Darkne&s;s, till the Cock crow, the welcome Me&s;&s;enger of the News of Day.</P>
<P>The Circum&s;tances therefore of the Time of Cock-crowing, being &s;o natural a Figure and Repre&s;entation of the Morning of the Re&s;ur|rection; the Night &s;o &s;hadowing out the Night of the Grave; the third Watch, being as &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e, the Time our Saviour will come to Judgment at; the Noi&s;e of the <HI>Cock</HI> awaken|ing &s;leepy Man, and telling him as it were, <HI>the Night is far &s;pent, the Day is at Hand;</HI> re|pre&s;enting &s;o naturally the Voice of the Arch-Angel awakening the Dead, and calling up the Righteous to everla&s;ting Day; &s;o natural|ly does the Time of Cock-crowing &s;hadow out the&s;e Things, that probably &s;ome good well-meaning Men, have been brought to believe, that the very Devils them&s;elves, when the Cock crew, and reminded them of them, did fear and tremble, and &s;hun the Light.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="84">Now in An&s;wer to the fir&s;t of the&s;e Conjec|tures: 'Tis very likely the Evil Spirits did fly away in the Morning of the Nativity, and becau&s;e of our Saviour's Birth and that <HI>Com|pany of the heavenly Ho&s;t,</HI> might be afraid and retire into thick Darkne&s;s; yet it will not hence follow, that it always happens &s;o at the Time of Cock-crowing: For if they did fly away that Morning, the Circum&s;tances of our Saviour's Birth, the heavenly Glory of the Angelick Quire, their Mu&s;ick and their Pre|&s;ence were the Occa&s;ion of it: And why only the bare Remembrance of what happened at that Time, &s;hould always at the Time of Cock-crowing drive them away, rather than when they remember it at another, no Rea&s;on &s;eems to be given.</P>
<P>As to the &s;econd Conjecture, namely, That it was the Time of our Saviour's Ri&s;ing from the Dead, I an&s;wer in the &s;ame Manner, That tho' it be allowed, that the Evil Spirits might have returned to the Land of Darkne&s;s, upon our Saviour's Ri&s;ing from the Dead; yet why it &s;hould occa&s;ion them always to do &s;o at that Time, no Rea&s;on can be given.</P>
<P>As to the third Conjecture, it is ea&s;y to ob&s;erve, That this was a good Angel, where|as they that &s;hun the Light, are bad ones: This was the Angel of the Covenant, the Cre|ator of Light, and the Lord of the Day: We
<PB N="67" REF="85">
may therefore as well imagine, that it was not in his Power, to get out of the Arms of <HI>Jacob,</HI> without &s;aying, <HI>Let me go;</HI> as to &s;uppo&s;e he was obliged to go, becau&s;e he &s;aid <HI>the Day breaketh.</HI> The meaning of which Words, <Q>According to <HI>Willet,</HI> is not that the Angel was gone to the ble&s;&s;ed Company of the Angels, to &s;ing their Morning Hymn to GOD, as the <HI>Hebrews</HI> imagine: For the Angels, not only in the Morning, but at other Times, are exerci&s;ed in prai&s;ing GOD. But the Angel thus &s;peaketh according to the Cu&s;tom of Men, having now taken the Form and Shape of a Man, as tho' he had ha&s;t to other Bu&s;ine&s;s, and leaving <HI>Jacob</HI> al&s;o to his Affairs.</Q></P>
<P>The la&s;t Conjecture of the Ri&s;e of this Tra|dition, &s;eems to carry greater Probability than the others: For as the&s;e Things are a Repre|&s;entation of the Circum&s;tances of the Morning of the Re&s;urrection, &s;o they mu&s;t &s;ure enough bring that la&s;t Day into Remembrance; and they never can do &s;o, but as &s;urely they mu&s;t create Terrour and Confu&s;ion in all the Devils and Gho&s;ts of the Night: Whil&s;t they a&s;&s;ure them they &s;hall never any more enjoy the Realms of Bli&s;s, but be hurried into that<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxv. 41.</NOTE> <HI>e|verla&s;ting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his
<PB N="68" REF="86">
Angels.</HI> But that the&s;e Things are the Occa|&s;ion of their flying away at the Approach of Day, is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed. On the contrary, the Devil and his Angels ramble o'er the World in Day-light, and are Mid-day Devils, as well as Mid-night ones: For the Devil is ince&s;&s;ant in his Temptations, and therefore he is abroad in the Day as well as the Night, tho' perhaps has &s;eldom appear'd but in Darkne&s;s. Thus St. <HI>Au&s;tin,</HI> in one of his Meditations,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Et ideo Deus meus ad te clamamus, libera nos ab ad|ver&s;ario no&s;tro quotidiano, qui &s;ive dormiamus, &s;ive vigile|mus,&mdash;die ac nocte fraudibus &amp; artibus, nunc palam nunc occulte &s;agittas venenatas contra nos dirigens, ut interficiat animas no&s;tras. <HI>Aug. Sol.

<P>And now, what, though this be true, as it mo&s;t certainly &s;eems to be &s;o, that at the chearful Hour of Cock-crowing, the wander|ing Gho&s;ts are not driven away, but &s;till continue going too and fro? What, tho' then their Power be &s;till the &s;ame, and their Inten|tions as fully bent to do Evil? Con&s;ider but that GOD'S Care and Providence govern the World, and there will be found as much Safe|ty for us, in the Mid&s;t of Evil Spirits, as if
<PB N="69" REF="87">
they ab&s;ented at that Time. The Almighty Power of GOD, is the &s;ame then, as at other Times; nothing but that, pre&s;erved us conti|nually, and that, will always be able to pre|&s;erve us. However great may be the Malice of Devils; however de&s;irous of working our Ruin; tho' they watch all Opportunities, and are unwearied in tempting us; <HI>yet the loving Kindne&s;s of the LORD endureth for Ever, and his Mercy is over all his Works: He will not &s;uffer our Foot to be moved; he that keepeth us will not &s;leep: We &s;hall not be afraid of the Sun by Day, nor the Moon by Night: For the Pe&s;ti|lence that walketh in Darkne&s;s, nor for the Sick|ne&s;s that de&s;troyeth in the Noon-day.</HI></P>
<P>Are we then afraid of Darkne&s;s and the Pre|&s;ence of Night? Let us remember the Creator of them, and have but Faith in him, and we &s;hall find <HI>our Night turned into Day. In his Light &s;hall we &s;ee Light:</HI> We &s;hall be as &s;e|cure as if there was no Darkne&s;s about us, as well knowing that that GOD which protects us, &s;ees through the thicke&s;t <HI>Mediums,</HI> and the darke&s;t Night: <HI>For with him the Darkne&s;s is no Darkne&s;s, but the Night is as clear as the Day; the Darkne&s;s and Light to him are both alike.</HI> Or are we afraid of that old Serpent the Devil, that nightly Rambler of the World, who is a Lover of Night and Darkne&s;s? Let us tru&s;t in GOD, and no Harm &s;hall happen
<PB N="70" REF="88">
to us. If we will but <HI>fear no Evil, his Rod and his Staff &s;hall comfort us, though we walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death: For GOD hath re&s;erved the Devil and his Angels in everla&s;ting Chains, under Darkne&s;s, unto the Judgment of the great Day.</HI> Though therefore he is permitted to wander the World, yet he is &s;o chain'd up, that without GOD'S parti|cular Order or Permi&s;&s;ion, he is not allowed to touch the Sons of Men; and he is &s;o re|&s;erved and kept in Darkne&s;s, that it is not in his Power even barely to appear and be vi&s;ible to them, without the Permi&s;&s;ion of GOD: So little Rea&s;on hath every good Man to fear the Spight and Malice of all the Devils in Hell.</P>
<P>When then the Night pours out her Ter|rours, covers all Things with Darkne&s;s, and &s;trikes thee with Horrour; <HI>Lift but up thy Eyes to the Hills, from whence cometh thy Help,</HI> and thou &s;halt clearly &s;ee, that our <HI>Lord GOD is a Light and Defence to thee.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">&mdash; Quia filiis lucis &amp; in noctibus dies e&s;t.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Of Church-yards; why the Vulgar are generally afraid of pa&s;&s;ing through them at Night: The Original of this Fear: That there is nothing in them now, more than in other Places to be afraid of.</HEAD>
<P>THE mo&s;t of ignorant People are afraid of going through a <HI>Church-Yard</HI> at Night-time. If they are obliged upon &s;ome ha&s;ty and urgent Affair, they fear and trem|ble, till they are beyond its Bounds, but they generally avoid it, and go further about. It would, no Que&s;tion, be better if there were fewer <HI>Path-ways</HI> through Church-Yards than there are, both as it would prevent &s;everal <HI>Abu&s;es</HI> committed in them, and al&s;o cau&s;e the A&s;hes of the Dead to be in greater Quiet, and more undi&s;turbed Peace: We &s;hould not then &s;ee Church-Yards changed into common Dung-hills, nor &s;hould we tread &s;o frequently upon the Bones of our Friends: But when for the Conveniency of Neighbourhood, or other Rea|&s;ons, there are allowed public Ways, it is a very great Weakne&s;s to be afraid of pa&s;&s;ing through them.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;on of this Fear is, a Notion they have imbib'd, that in <HI>Church-Yards</HI> there is a frequent walking of Spirits at the <HI>Dead-time</HI>
<PB N="77" REF="95">
of Night. Indeed there is at that Time &s;ome|thing awful and horrible every where, and it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd &s;omething more &s;olemn in a <HI>Church-Yard,</HI> than in the Generality of other Places; but that it is then more frequented with <HI>Apparitions and Gho&s;ts</HI> than other Places are, is at this Time of Day intirely ground|le&s;s, and without any Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>The Original of this Timorou&s;ne&s;s may be deduc'd from the Heathens: For they believ|ed that the <HI>departed Gho&s;ts</HI> came out of their <HI>Tombs</HI> and <HI>Sepulchres,</HI> and wander'd about the Place where the Body lay buried. Thus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Maerin &s;aepe animas imis excire &s;epulchris,</L>

<P>It having therefore been a current Opinion of the Heathens, that <HI>Places of Burial and Church-Yards</HI> were frequently haunted with <HI>Spectres</HI> and <HI>Apparitions,</HI> it is ea&s;y to imagine, that the Opinion has been handed from them, among the Ignorant and unlearned, through|out all the Ages of Chri&s;tianity to the pre&s;ent Day. And indeed, tho' now there may be no &s;uch Things, yet that there have been, need not be di&s;puted; not that they were the real Souls of Men departed: For I cannot &s;ee for
<PB N="79" REF="97">

Chri&s;t. ibid.</NOTE> how|ever unacquainted &s;uch Souls might be with the Plea&s;ures of Spirits) that they are permit|ted to wander, to hover about, and linger after their Bodies.</Q> It &s;eems rather to be true, what is mentioned of &s;uch Apparitions in St. <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI>'s Que&s;tions to <HI>Antiochius,</HI> that<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Athan. Tom. <HI>2.</HI> P. <HI>340.</HI></NOTE> the&s;e Apparitions of the Saints which appear at Tombs and Temples, are not the Souls of the Saints them&s;elves, but the good Angels ap|pearing in their Likene&s;s. And I imagine it mu&s;t be &s;o too, with the Souls of bad Men, they appear not them&s;elves, but they are re|pre&s;ented by the evil Angels. For the Soul upon the Departure, <HI>returns to GOD that gave it,</HI> who allots it its Station in the World of Spirits, where it is kept till the Day of Judgment in Happine&s;s or Mi&s;ery, when it &s;hall receive its Compleation of the one, or the other. However, whatever the&s;e Apparitions were, they are a certain Proof, that &s;uch Ap|pearances have been in &s;uch Places; and in|deed, to add no more, it is the whole Voice of Antiquity.</P>
<P>But now with us, GOD be thanked, the Scene is changed, we live not in the Darkne&s;s of Errour, but in the Light of Truth; we wor&s;hip not <HI>Daemons,</HI> but the GOD of the whole Earth; and our Temples are not the Temples of Idols, but the Temples of the Ho|ly

<P>Mr. Strutt tells us, that before the Time of Chri&s;tianity it was held unlawful to bury the Dead <HI>within</HI> the Cities, but they u&s;ed to carry them out into the Fields hard by and there depo&s;ited them.

<P>Our Author is certainly very right, when he tells us that <HI>Church-yards</HI> are as little frequented by Apparitions and Gho&s;ts as other Places, and that therefore it is a Weakne&s;s to be afraid of pa&s;&s;ing through them.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> Of vi&s;iting Wells and Fountains: The Original of this Cu&s;tom: The naming of them of great An|tiquity: The Wor&s;hip paid them by the Pa|pi&s;ts, was gro&s;s Idolatry.</HEAD>
<P>IN the dark Ages of <HI>Popery,</HI> it was a Cu&s;tom, if any <HI>Well</HI> had an awful Situation, and was &s;eated in &s;ome lonely melancholy Vale; if its Water was clear and limpid, and beauti|fully<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">&mdash;Viridi &s;i margine clauderet undas.&mdash;Herba.&mdash; <HI>Juven.

<P>To the&s;e kind of Wells, the common People are accu&s;tomed to go, on a Summer's Evening, to refre&s;h them&s;elves with a <HI>Walk</HI> after the Toil of the Day, to drink the Water of the Fountain, and enjoy the plea&s;ing Pro&s;pect of Shade and Stream.</P>
<P>Now this Cu&s;tom (tho' at this Time of Day, very commendable, and harmle&s;s, and inno|cent) &s;eems to be the Remains of that &s;uper|&s;titious Practice of the Papi&s;ts, of paying

In the Ages of dark Popery it was thought &s;ufficient to forbid the honouring of Wells and Fountains, without the Bi&s;hop's Appro|bation.</Q></P>
<P>The giving of Names to Wells, is of great Antiquity: We find it a Cu&s;tom in the Days of the old Patriarchs. <HI>Abraham</HI> ob&s;erved this Cu&s;tom; and therefore the Well, which he
<PB N="84" REF="102">

And he removed from thence, and digged ano|ther Well, and for that they &s;trove not; and he called the Name of it</HI> Rehoboth, that is, <HI>Room. And he &s;aid for now the LORD hath made Room for us, and we &s;hall be fruitful in the Land.</HI> And we read it was at <HI>Jacob</HI>'s <HI>Well</HI> where JESUS talked with the Woman of <HI>Sa|maria.</HI> To give Names therefore to Wells, is of an ancient Standing; but to pay Homage and Wor&s;hip to them, was never heard of a|mong the People of GOD, till they &s;unk in|to gro&s;s Idolatry, and became Wor&s;hippers of Stocks and Stones: <HI>When the creature became wor&s;hipped in&s;tead of the Creator,</HI> then was this Cu&s;tom fir&s;t introduced, in the Ages of Popi&s;h Ignorance and Idolatry.</P>
<P>There need be no Que&s;tion, but as this Cu&s;|tom is practically Heatheni&s;h, &s;o it is al&s;o originally: For the Heathens were wont to

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. X.</HI> Of the Country Conver&s;ation in a Winter's Even|ing: Their Opinions of Spirits and Apparitions; of the Devil's appearing with a cloven Foot; of Fairies and Hobgoblins; of the walking Places of Spirits; and of haunted Hou&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>NOthing is commoner in <HI>Country Places,</HI> than for a whole Family in a <HI>Winter's Evening,</HI> to &s;it round the Fire, and tell Stories of Apparitions and Gho&s;ts. And no Que&s;tion of it, but this adds to the natural Fearfulne&s;s of Men, and makes them many Times ima|gine they &s;ee Things, which really are no|thing but their own Fancy. From this, and &s;eldom any other Cau&s;e, it is, that <HI>Herds</HI> and <HI>Shepherds</HI> have all of them &s;een <HI>frequent Ap|paritions,</HI> and are generally &s;o well &s;tock'd with Stories of their own Knowledge. Some of them have &s;een <HI>Fairies,</HI> &s;ome <HI>Spirits</HI> in the Shapes of <HI>Cows</HI> and <HI>Dogs</HI> and <HI>Hor&s;es;</HI> and &s;ome have &s;een even the <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf, with a <HI>cloven Foot.</HI> All which, is either <HI>Hear&s;ay</HI> or a <HI>&s;trong Imagination.</HI> Not that there have not been, or may not be Apparitions; we know that there have undoubtedly been &s;uch Things, and that there &s;till are, upon parti|lar Occa&s;ions; but that almo&s;t all the Stories of Gho&s;ts and Spirits, are grounded on no
<PB N="103" REF="121">
other Bottom, than the Fears and Fancies, and weak Brains of Men.</P>
<P>In their Account of the Apparition of the Devil, they always de&s;cribe him with a <HI>cloven Foot:</HI> That is always his di&s;tingui&s;hing Badge, whatever Shape he appears in; whe|ther it be in Beauty or Deformity, he never appears without it. Such is the old Tradi|tion they have received of his appearing, and &s;uch is their Belief of it.</P>
<P>Indeed it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, that this is not &s;o improbable and ridiculous as many Things they hold. For tho' perhaps few of them have ought el&s;e for this Opinion, but <HI>old Wives Fables,</HI> or the Picture of the Devil, which they have always ob&s;erved drawn with a cloven Foot, yet there &s;eems to be &s;ome Truth in it. For in the Times of frequent Apparitions, the Devil was wont to appear &s;o, if we may believe Antiquity; and there is al&s;o &s;ome Rea&s;on for it, con&s;idering the Cir|cum&s;tances of the fallen Angels.</P>
<P>The<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brown's Vulg. Err.</NOTE> Author of the <HI>Vulgar Errors</HI> upon this &s;ame Subject, hath the&s;e Words. <Q>The Ground of this Opinion at fir&s;t, might be his frequent appearing in the Shape of a Goat, which an&s;wers this De&s;cription. This was the Opinion of the ancient Chri|&s;tians,
<PB N="104" REF="122">
concerning the Apparitions of <HI>Pa|nites, Fauns</HI> and <HI>Satyrs;</HI> and of this Form we read of one, that appeared to <HI>Anthony</HI> in the Wilderne&s;s. The &s;ame is al&s;o confirmed from Expo&s;itions of Holy Scripture. For whereas it is &s;aid, <HI>Thou &s;halt not offer unto Devils:</HI> The original Word is <HI>Seghnirim;</HI> that is, <HI>rough and hairy Goats,</HI> becau&s;e in that Shape the Devil mo&s;t often appeared, as is expounded by the <HI>Rabbins,</HI> as <HI>Tremellius</HI> hath al&s;o explain'd, and as the Word <HI>A&s;ci|mah,</HI> the God of <HI>Emath</HI> is by &s;ome conceived. He ob&s;erves al&s;o, That the <HI>Goat</HI> was the Emblem of the <HI>Sin Offering,</HI> and is the Em|blem of Sinful Men at the Day of Judg|ment.</Q></P>
<P>And of this Opinion was al&s;o the learned Mr.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mede, Di&s;. 40.</NOTE> <HI>Mede.</HI> He &s;ays, <Q>That when Spirits conver&s;e with Men, it is under &s;ome vi&s;ible Shape, and that there is a Law given them that that Shape they a&s;&s;um'd, &s;hould be of &s;omething which more or le&s;s re&s;embled their Condition. For as in Nature we &s;ee every Thing hath a &s;everal and &s;uitable <HI>Phy&s;iog|nomy</HI> or <HI>Figure,</HI> as a Badge of their inward Nature, whereby it is known, as by a Habit of Di&s;tinction, &s;o it &s;eems to be in the Shapes and Apparitions of Spirits. And as in a well governed Common Wealth,
<PB N="105" REF="123">
every Sort and Condition is known by a dif|fering Habit, agreeable to his Quality; &s;o it &s;eems it &s;hould be in GOD'S great Common Wealth, concerning the Shapes which Spi|rits take upon them. And he that gave the Law, that a Man &s;hould not wear the Habit of a Woman, nor a Woman the Ha|bit of a Man, becau&s;e that as he had made them diver&s;e, &s;o would he have them &s;o known by their Habits; &s;o it &s;eems he will not &s;uffer a good and a bad Spirit, a noble and ignoble one, to appear unto Man after the &s;ame Fa&s;hion.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Now from this it will follow, that good Angels can take upon them no other Shape, but the Shape of Man, becau&s;e their glori|ous Excellency is re&s;embled only in the mo&s;t excellent of all vi&s;ible Creatures. The Shape of an inferior Creature would be un|&s;uitable, no other Shape becoming tho&s;e who are called <HI>the Sons of GOD,</HI> but his only, who <HI>was created after GOD's own Image.</HI> And yet, not his neither as he now is, but according as he was before his Fall in his glorious Beauty of his Integrity. Age and Deformity are the Fruits of Sin; and the Angel in the Go&s;pel appears like a young Man, <HI>His</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. xxviii.</NOTE> <HI>Countenance like Light|ning, and his Raiment white as Snow,</HI> as it
<PB N="106" REF="124">
were re&s;embling the Beauty of glorified Bodies, in Immutability, Sublimity and Purity.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Hence al&s;o it follows on the contrary, that the Devil could not appear in humane Shape whil&s;t Man was in his Integrity; be|cau&s;e he was a Spirit fallen from his fir&s;t glorious Perfection, and therefore mu&s;t ap|pear in &s;uch Shape, which might argue his Imperfection and Aba&s;ement, which was the Shape of a Bea&s;t: Otherwi&s;e no Rea&s;on can be given, why he &s;hould not rather have appeared to <HI>Eve</HI> in the Shape of a Woman, than of a Serpent; for &s;o he might have gain'd an Opinion with her, both of more Excellency and Knowledge. But &s;ince the Fall of Man, the Ca&s;e is al|ter'd; now we know he can take upon him the Shape of Man; and no Wonder, &s;ince one falling Star may re&s;emble another. And therefore he appears it &s;eems in the Shape of Man's Imperfection, either for Age or Deformity, as like an old Man (for &s;o the Witches &s;ay:) And perhaps it is not altogether fal&s;e, which is vulgarly affirmed, that the Devil appearing in humane Shape, hath always a Deformity of &s;ome uncouth Member or other; as tho' he could not yet take upon him humane Shape intirely, for that Man him&s;elf, is not intirely and ut|terly fallen as he is.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="125">Thus far hath this great and learned Man given his Opinion of this Matter, and that with &s;uch Strength of Rea&s;on and Argument, as leaves at lea&s;t a Probability behind it, of the Truth of this Opinion.</P>
<P>Another Part of this Conver&s;ation generally turns upon <HI>Fairies.</HI> The&s;e, they tell you, have frequently been heard and &s;een, nay that there are &s;ome &s;till living who were &s;tolen away by them, and confined &s;even Years. According to the De&s;cription they give of them, who pretend to have &s;een them, they are in the Shape of Men, exceeding little: They are always clad in Green, and frequent the Woods and Fields; when they make Cakes (which is a Work they have been often heard at) they are very noi&s;y; and when they have done, they are full of Mirth and Pa&s;time. But generally they dance in <HI>Moon-Light</HI> when Mor|tals are a&s;leep, and not capable of &s;eeing them, as may be ob&s;erved on the following Morn; their dancing Places being very di&s;tingui&s;h|able. For as they dance Hand in Hand, and &s;o make a <HI>Circle</HI> in their Dance, &s;o next Day there will be &s;een <HI>Rings</HI> and <HI>Circles</HI> on the Gra&s;s.</P>
<P>Now in all this there is really nothing, but an old fabulous Story, which has been handed down even to our Days from the Times of <HI>Heatheni&s;m,</HI> of a certain Sort of Beings called
<PB N="108" REF="126">
<HI>Lamiae,</HI> which were e&s;teemed &s;o mi&s;chievous and cruel, as to take away young Children and &s;lay them. The&s;e, together with the <HI>the Fauns,</HI> the <HI>Gods of the Woods,</HI> &s;eem to have formed the Notion of Fairies.</P>
<P>This Opinion, in the benighted Ages of Popery, when <HI>Hobgoblins</HI> and <HI>Sprights</HI> were in every <HI>City</HI> and <HI>Town</HI> and <HI>Village,</HI> by every <HI>Water</HI> and in every <HI>Wood,</HI> was very common. But when that Cloud was di&s;pell'd, and the Day &s;prung up, tho&s;e Spirits which wander'd in the Night of Ignorance and Error, did real|ly vani&s;h at the Dawn of Truth and the Light of Knowledge.</P>
<P>Another Tradition they hold, and which is often talk'd of, is, that there are particular Places alotted to Spirits to walk in. Thence it was that formerly, &s;uch frequent Reports were abroad of this and that particular Place being haunted by a Spirit, and that the com|mon People &s;ay now and then, &s;uch a Place is dangerous to be pa&s;s'd through at Night, be|cau&s;e a Spirit walks there. Nay, they'll fur|ther tell you, that &s;ome Spirits have lamented the Hardne&s;s of their Condition, in being ob|liged to walk in cold and uncomfortable Pla|ces, and have therefore de&s;ired the Per&s;on who was &s;o hardy as to &s;peak to them, to gift them with a warmer Walk, by &s;ome well grown
<PB N="109" REF="127">
<HI>Hedge,</HI> or in &s;ome <HI>&s;hady Vale,</HI> where they might be &s;helter'd from the Rain and Wind.</P>
<P>The Stories, that Apparitions have been &s;een oftner than once in the &s;ame Place, have no Doubt been the Ri&s;e and Spring of the walking Places of Spirits; but why they are &s;aid &s;ometimes to cry out for Places that are more comfortable, is not &s;o certainly known. It is however highly probable, that when the Ignorance and Super&s;tition of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church, had filled the World with <HI>Apparitions</HI> and <HI>Gho&s;ts,</HI> that this al&s;o was invented among them. For they &s;eem to have the mo&s;t <HI>Right</HI> to an Invention of this Nature, who&s;e Brains were &s;o fruitful of Folly, as to invent that<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fuller's Ch. Hi&s;t. Cen. 10.</NOTE> <HI>Dun&s;tan</HI> took the Devil by the No&s;e, with a Pair of hot <HI>Tongs</HI> till he roar'd again. For if the Devil may be burnt, he may al&s;o be &s;tarv'd; if he took &s;uch Pains to get his No&s;e out of the <HI>Pincers,</HI> without Doubt in a fro&s;ty Night, he would wi&s;h to be as warm as po&s;&s;i|ble. He that believes the one, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily believe the other. And therefore it very near amounts to a Demon&s;tration, who were the Authors of this Opinion, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Monks.</HI> We are &s;ure they invented the one, and need little que&s;tion but they invented the other.</P>
<P>There is a Story in the Book of <HI>Tobit,</HI> (which they may believe that will) of the <HI>evil Spirits</HI>
<PB N="110" REF="128">
flying into the utmo&s;t Parts of <HI>Egypt.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tob. vi.</NOTE> <HI>For as</HI> Tobias <HI>went in unto his Wife, he remembred the Words of</HI> Raphael, <HI>and took the A&s;hes of the Perfumes, and put the Heart and Liver of the Fi&s;h thereupon, and made a Smoke therewith. The which Smell, when the evil Spirit had &s;melled, he fled unto the utmo&s;t Parts of</HI> Egypt, <HI>and the Angel bound him.</HI> Now from this it is evident, that the Spirit was obliged to for&s;ake his good old Quarters and warm Lodgings, for inho&s;pitable De&s;arts and open Air: And from this, perhaps, &s;ome of tho&s;e <HI>doting Monks</HI> have per&s;uaded them&s;elves into a Belief of the&s;e Things.</P>
<P>When it is proved to us, that this Book of <HI>Tobit</HI> is the Word of GOD, we may entertain more Veneration for this vulgar Opinion; but till then, we mu&s;t be indulg'd in wondering, how a Spirit, that is an <HI>immaterial Sub&s;tance,</HI> can be affected with our Heat or Cold, or any Power or Quality of <HI>material Beings.</HI></P>
<P>The la&s;t Topick of this Conver&s;ation I &s;hall take Notice of, &s;hall be the Tales of <HI>haunted</HI> Hou&s;es. And indeed it is not to be wonder'd at, that this is never omitted. For formerly almo&s;t every Place had a Hou&s;e of this Kind. If a Hou&s;e was &s;eated on &s;ome melancholly Place, or built in &s;ome old romantic Manner; or if any particular Accident had happen'd in
<PB N="111" REF="129">
it, &s;uch as Murder, &s;udden Death, or the like, to be &s;ure that Hou&s;e had a Mark &s;et on it, and was afterwards e&s;teemed the Habitation of a Gho&s;t. In talking upon this Point, they generally &s;how the Occa&s;ion of the Hou&s;e's be|ing <HI>haunted,</HI> the merry Pranks of the Spirit, and how it was laid. Stories of this Kind are infinite, and there are few <HI>Villages</HI> which have not either had &s;uch an Hou&s;e in it, or near it.</P>
<P>And indeed there are Men of good Learn|ing and Knowledge, who are as far as others from Super&s;tition, who are inclinable to be|lieve, that &s;uch Things have been upon parti|cular Emergencies; tho', among the Stories that are told, they believe not one in a thou|&s;and. They know that Spirits have frequent|ly appeared to Men out of Hou&s;es, and they can &s;ee no Rea&s;on why they may not have ap|peared in them: They know nothing in an Hou&s;e more than in another Place, to prevent an Apparition, but an equal Help to its Vi&s;i|bility. The Air, which a Gho&s;t is &s;uppo&s;ed to be wrapped in, when it becomes vi&s;ible to Men, is there to be found, and they know of nothing el&s;e that may be an Argument again&s;t it. An Author of good Credit tells us,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cum <HI>Romae</HI> aegra valetudine oppre&s;&s;us forem, jaceremque in lectulo, &s;peciem mulieris eleganti forma mihi plane vigi|lanti ob&s;ervatam fui&s;&s;e, quam cum in&s;picerem, diu cogita|bundus, &amp;c.&mdash;Cum meos &s;en&s;us vigere, &amp; figuram illam nu&s;quam a me dilabi, &amp;c. <HI>Alex. ab Alex.

Upon this he was &s;ilent for &s;ome Time, and very thoughtful, weigh|ing all the while with him&s;elf, whether it was not rather a <HI>deceptio vi&s;us</HI> than a real Being. But when he perceived his Sen&s;es &s;ound and intire, and that the Object &s;till continued; he a&s;ked, What &s;he was? In An&s;wer to which, &s;he repeated the very Words he had &s;poken to her, in a &s;neering and di&s;dainful Manner. After &s;he had taken a good View of him, &s;he departed.</P>
<P>The Commentator upon this Place, &s;ays,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sed haec &s;emper mera &s;omnia e&s;&s;e putavi. <HI>ibid.</HI></NOTE> He looks upon this Story, and the re&s;t which are mentioned along with it, to be nothing but Dreams and Fancies. And for ought that I know to the contrary, they may be &s;o; but however it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, this Story in particular is well atte&s;ted, being told by the Man him&s;elf, who was a great and a learned Man, and who, if we may believe him&s;elf, &s;eems to be as &s;ure that he had his Eyes open, as the Commentator can be of the contrary.</P>

<P>Among the&s;e we find a great Deference paid to <HI>Saturday Afternoon,</HI> above the other worky Days of the Week: Then the Labours of the Plough cea&s;t, and Refre&s;hment and Ea&s;e are over all the Village.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIII.</HI> Of the Yule-Clog and Chri&s;tmas-Candle; what they may &s;ignifie; their Antiquity; the like Cu&s;toms in other Places.</HEAD>
<P>IN the <HI>Primitive Church,</HI> Chri&s;tmas-Day was always ob&s;erv'd as the <HI>Lord's-Day</HI> was, and was in like Manner preceded by an <HI>Eve or Vigil.</HI> Hence it is that our Church hath ordered an <HI>Eve</HI> before it, which is ob&s;erved by the Religious, as a Day of Preparation for that great Fe&s;tival.</P>
<P>Our Fore-Fathers, when the common De|votions of the <HI>Eve</HI> were over, and Night was come on, were wont to light up <HI>Candles</HI> of an uncommon Size, which were called <HI>Chri&s;tmas-Candles,</HI> and to lay a <HI>Log</HI> of Wood upon the Fire, which they termed a <HI>Yule-Clog,</HI> or <HI>Chri&s;tmas-Block.</HI> The&s;e were to Illuminate the Hou&s;e, and turn the Night into Day; which Cu&s;tom, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, is &s;till kept up in the Northern Parts.</P>
<P>It hath, in all probability, been derived from the <HI>Saxons.</HI> For <HI>Bede</HI> tells us, That this very Night was ob&s;erved in this Land before, by the <HI>Heathen Saxons.</HI> They<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Incipiebant autem annum ab octavo calendarum <HI>Januarii</HI> die, ubi nunc natale domini celebramus; &amp; ip&s;am noctem nuuc nobis &s;acro-&s;anctam tunc gentili vocabulo maedrenack, i. e. matrum noctem appellabant: Ob cau&s;am, ut &s;u&s;picamur, ceremoniarum, quas in ea pervigiles agebant. <HI>Beda de Rat.

The <HI>Yule-Clog</HI> therefore hath probably been a Part of that Night's Ceremonies. The very Name &s;eems to &s;peak it, and tells its Original to every Age.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to have been u&s;ed, as an Emblem of the return of the <HI>Sun,</HI> and the lengthening of the Days.

of the Sun's Returning, and the In|crea&s;e of the Days; &s;o, I am apt to believe, the Log has had the Name of the <HI>Yule-Log,</HI> from its being burnt as an Emblem of the returning Sun, and the Increa&s;e of its Light and Heat.</P>
<P>This was probably the Rea&s;on of the Cu|&s;tom among the <HI>Heathen Saxons;</HI> but I can|not think the Ob&s;ervation of it was continued for the &s;ame Rea&s;on, after Chri&s;tianity was embraced.

<PB N="158" REF="176">
hopes of his Returning; yet when Chri&s;|tianity prevailed, all the&s;e Idolatrous Sa|crifices were laid a&s;ide, and that Time of Fea&s;ting was joined with the religious So|lemnity of that Sea&s;on, which in other Parts of the World were ob&s;erved by Chri&s;tians.</Q> And in like Manner as the&s;e Days of Fea&s;ting were joined with the reli|gious Solemnities of that Sea&s;on, &s;o the keep|ing up of this Cu&s;tom, &s;eems to have been done with another View, than it was ori|ginally. If a Conjecture may be allowed, it might have been done on Account of our Saviour's Birth, which happened that Night. For as the Burning of it before Chri&s;tianity, was an Emblem of the Coming of the Sun, which they wor&s;hipped as their God; &s;o the continuing it after, might have been for a Symbol of that Light, which was that Night born into the World: <HI>The Light that &s;hineth in Darkne&s;s; the Light that lightned the</HI> Gen|tiles, <HI>that turn'd them from Darkne&s;s to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto GOD.</HI></P>
<P>And indeed it will be &s;ome &s;trengthening of the Conjecture, that Light has been the Emblem of &s;everal Things, both in Scripture, and in the ancient Church: For the Scripture makes u&s;e of it, and the Church in Imitation of the Scripture, as a lively Rere&s;entation of &s;everal Things.

<P>And no doubt, tho&s;e Chri&s;tians were high|ly worthy of Cen&s;ure, who imagined, as the Heathens did, that the &s;ending of a Pre&s;ent then, was any way <HI>Lucky,</HI> and an <HI>Omen</HI> of the Succe&s;s of the following Year.

<P>Another old Cu&s;tom at this Time, is the wi&s;hing of a <HI>good New-Year,</HI> either when a New-Year's Gift is pre&s;ented, or when Friends meet, or when a New-Year's Song is &s;ung at the Door; the Burden of which is, <HI>we wi&s;h you a happy New-Year.</HI></P>

<P>Now the Original of this Cu&s;tom is Hea|theni&s;h, as appears by the Fea&s;ting and Pre|&s;ents before mentioned, which were a wi&s;h for a good Year.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XVII.</HI> Of the Twelfth Day; how ob&s;erved: The Wick|edne&s;s of ob&s;erving the Twelve Days after the common Way.</HEAD>
<P>ON the <HI>Epiphany,</HI> or <HI>Manife&s;tation of</HI> Chri&s;t <HI>to the</HI> Gentiles, commonly called the Twelfth-Day, the <HI>Ea&s;tern Magi</HI> were guided by the Star, to pay their Homage to their Sa|viour; and becau&s;e they came that Day, which is the Twelfth after the Day of the Nativity, it is therefore called the <HI>Twelfth-Day.</HI></P>
<P>The Twelfth-Day it &s;elf is one of the great|e&s;t of the Twelve, and of more jovial Ob&s;er|vation than the others, for the vi&s;iting of Friends and Chri&s;tmas-Gambols. The Rites of this Day are different in divers Places, tho' the End of them is much the &s;ame in all; namely, to do Honour to the Memory of the <HI>Ea&s;tern Magi,</HI> whom they &s;uppo&s;e to have been Kings. In<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In <HI>Gallia</HI> unus ex mini&s;tris, &amp;c.&mdash;Idem in <HI>Germania,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Ho&s;pin. in Epiphan.</HI></NOTE> <HI>France,</HI> one of the Courtiers is cho&s;en King, whom the King him&s;elf, and the other Nobles, attend at an Entertainment. In <HI>Germany,</HI> they ob&s;erve the &s;ame Thing on this Day in Academies and Cities, where the Students and Citizens create one of them&s;elves <HI>King,</HI> and provide a Magni|ficent
<PB N="200" REF="218">
Banquet for him, and give him the At|tendance of a <HI>King,</HI> or a <HI>&s;tranger Gue&s;t.</HI> Now this is an&s;werable to that Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Sa|turnalia,</HI> of <HI>Ma&s;ters</HI> making <HI>Banquets</HI> for their <HI>Servants,</HI> and waiting on them; and no doubt this Cu&s;tom has in Part &s;prung from that.</P>
<P>Not many Years ago, this was a common <HI>Chri&s;tmas Gambol</HI> in both our <HI>Univer&s;ities;</HI> and it is &s;till u&s;ual in other Places of our Land, to give the Name of <HI>King</HI> or <HI>Queen</HI> to that Per&s;on, who&s;e extraordinary Luck hits upon that Part of the divided <HI>Cake,</HI> which is honour'd above the others, with a <HI>Bean</HI> in it.</P>
<P>But tho' this be generally the greate&s;t of the Twelve, yet the others preceding are ob&s;erved with Mirth and Jollity, generally to Exce&s;s. Was this Fea&s;ting confined within the Bounds of Decency and Moderation, and gave more Way than it does to the Exerci&s;es and the Re|ligious Duties of the Sea&s;on, it would have nothing in it immoral or &s;inful. The keeping up of Friend&s;hip, and Love, and old Acquain|tance, has nothing in it harmful; but the Misfortune is, Men upon that Bottom, act ra|ther like Brutes than Men, and like Heathens than Chri&s;tians; and the Pre&s;ervation of Friend&s;hip and Love, is nothing el&s;e but a Pretence for Drunkenne&s;s, and Rioting, and Wantonne&s;s. And &s;uch I am afraid hath been the Ob&s;ervation of the Chri&s;tmas Holy-days,
<PB N="201" REF="219">
&s;ince the holie&s;t Times of the Chri&s;tian Church; and the Generality of Men have rather look'd upon them, as a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Bi&s;hop <HI>Blackall</HI>'s Sermon on the Lawfulne&s;s and the right Manner of keeping Chri&s;tmas and other Chri&s;tian Fe&s;tivals.</NOTE> Time of Eating and Drink|ing, and Playing, than of returning Prai&s;es and Thank&s;givings to GOD, for the greate&s;t Benefit he ever be&s;tow'd upon the Sons of Men.</P>
<P><HI>Gregory Nazianzen,</HI> in that excellent Oration of his upon Chri&s;tmas-Day, &s;ays, Let us not celebrate the Fea&s;t after an Earthly, but an Heavenly Manner; let not our Doors be crown'd; let not Dancing be encourag'd; let not the Cro&s;s-paths be adorned, the Eyes fed, nor the Ears delighted, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Let us not Fea&s;t to exce&s;s, nor be Drunk with Wine, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> From this we may clearly &s;ee, what has been the Cu&s;tom in the&s;e Days.

For as the learned Bi&s;hop goes on, <Q><HI>Buchannan</HI> is &s;o well plea&s;ed with this notable Ob&s;ervation, that He &s;ets it down for good Hi&s;tory, &s;aying upon it, that the old <HI>Saturnalia</HI> were re|new'd, only the Days increa&s;ed, and <HI>Sa|turn</HI>'s Name chang'd to <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s: For &s;ays he, we call the Fea&s;t <HI>Julia.</HI> But why &s;hould the Name of <HI>Saturn</HI> be changed into <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s? Was he wor&s;hipped for a GOD among the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Chri&s;tians, as <HI>Saturn</HI> was among the old <HI>Pagans?</HI> But the Name <HI>Julia</HI> imports it; by no Means. For <HI>Buchannan</HI> does not prove, that this Name was ever u&s;ed for that Fe&s;tival among the <HI>Britains;</HI> and the <HI>Saxons,</HI> who brought in both the Name and the Fea&s;t, give another<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Chap. Chri&s;t. Candle.</NOTE> Rea&s;on for it.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="221"><HI>Buchannan</HI> &s;eems therefore to have a great deal more Malice than Truth on his Side. But however &s;uch Revellings, and Frolicks, and Extravagances, whether or not derived from the old <HI>Saturnalia,</HI> as are cu&s;tomary at this Sea&s;on, do come very near to, if not ex|ceed its Liberties.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XVIII.</HI> Of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Day; The Ob&s;ervation of the Weather, a Cu&s;tom of the Heathens, and hand|ed down by the Monks: The Apo&s;tle St. <HI>Paul</HI> him&s;elf is again&s;t &s;uch Ob&s;ervations; The Opinion of St. <HI>Au&s;tin</HI> upon them.</HEAD>
<P>THE Ob&s;ervation of the Weather which is made on this Day is altogether ridi|culous and &s;uper&s;titious. If it happen to be unclouded and without Rain, it is look'd upon as an Omen of the following Year's Succe&s;s, if otherwi&s;e, that the Year will be unfortunate. Thus the old Ver&s;e.
<Q><L>Clara dies <HI>Pauli,</HI> bona tempora denotat anni,</L>
<L>Si fuerint venti, denarrant praelia genti,</L>
<L>Si nix aut pluviae, pereunt animalia quaeque.</L></Q></P>
<P>The Interprepation of which is very well known to be this,
<Q><L>If St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Day be fair and clear,</L>
<L>It doth betide a happy Year;</L>
<L>If blu&s;tering Winds do blow aloft</L>
<L>Then Wars will trouble our Realm full oft.</L>
<L>And if it chance to Snow or Rain,</L>
<L>Then will be dear all Sorts of Grain.</L></Q></P>
<P>Such al&s;o is the Ob&s;ervation of St. <HI>Swithin</HI>'s Day, which if rainy is a Token that it will rain for forty Days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively; &s;uch is the
<PB N="209" REF="227">
Ob&s;ervation of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Si &s;ol &s;plende&s;cat <HI>Maria</HI> purificante,</L>
<L>Major erit glacies po&s;t fe&s;tum quam fuit ante.</L></Q></NOTE> <HI>Candlemas-Day,</HI> &s;uch is <HI>Childermas-Day,</HI> &s;uch <HI>Valentine's-Day,</HI> and &s;ome others.</P>
<P>How St. <HI>Paul's Day</HI> came to have this particular Knack of foretelling the good or evil Fortune of the following Year, is no ea&s;y Matter to find out. The Monks who were undoubtedly the fir&s;t who made this wonderful Ob&s;ervation, have taken Care it &s;hould be handed down to Po&s;terity, but why and for what Rea&s;on this Ob&s;ervation was to &s;tand good, they have taken Care to conceal. In Church Affairs indeed they make free with handing down <HI>Traditions</HI> from Generation to Generation, which being approved by an in|fallible Judgment, are to be taken for grant|ed; but as far as I hear, they never pretended to an infallible Spirit, in the Study of the Planets. One may therefore, without the Su&s;picion of Here&s;y, or fear of the <HI>Inqui&s;ition,</HI> make a little Inquiry into this Affair, and &s;ee whether it be true or fal&s;e, whether it is built upon any Rea&s;on or no Rea&s;on, whether &s;till to be ob&s;erved, or only laugh'd at as a Monki&s;h Dream.</P>
<P>Now as it is the Day of that Saint, <HI>the great Apo&s;tle St.</HI> Paul, I cannot &s;ee there is any Thing to be built upon. He did indeed <HI>labour
<PB N="210" REF="228">
more abundantly than all the Apo&s;tles;</HI> but never, that I heard, in the Science of A&s;tro|logy. And why his Day &s;hould therefore be a &s;tanding <HI>Almanack</HI> to the World, rather than the Day of any other <HI>Saint,</HI> will be pretty hard to find out. I am &s;ure there is a good Number of them, have as much Right to Rain or fair Weather as St. <HI>Paul,</HI> and if St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> &amp;c. have not as much Right to Wind or Snow, let the Reader judge.</P>
<P>As it is the Twenty fifth Day of <HI>January,</HI> one would think that could be no Rea&s;on. For what is that Day more than another? In|deed they do give &s;ome Shew of Rea&s;on, why Rain &s;hould happen about the Time of St. <HI>Swithin,</HI> which is this. About the Time of his Fea&s;t, which is on the Fourteenth of <HI>July,</HI> there are two rainy <HI>Con&s;tellations,</HI> which are called <HI>Praecepe</HI> and <HI>A&s;ellus,</HI> which ari&s;e <HI>co&s;mically,</HI> and generally produce Rain. And to be &s;ure in the Cour&s;e of the Sign <HI>Aquarius,</HI> there may be both Rain and Wind and fair Weather, but how the&s;e can foretell the De&s;|tiny of the Year, is the Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>As then there is nothing in the <HI>Saint,</HI> or his Day to progno&s;ticate any &s;uch Thing, I mean, as it is the Day of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> or the Twenty fifth of <HI>January,</HI> &s;o I mu&s;t confe&s;s I cannot find out what may be the Ground of
<PB N="211" REF="229">
this particular Ob&s;ervation. But however thus much is very obvious, that this Ob&s;er|vation is an exact Copy of that &s;uper&s;titious Cu&s;tom among the Heathens, of ob&s;erving one Day as good, and another as bad. For among them were lucky and unlucky Days; &s;ome were <HI>dies atri,</HI> and &s;ome <HI>dies albi;</HI> the <HI>atri</HI> were pointed out in their <HI>Calendar,</HI> with a black Character, the <HI>albi</HI> with a white; the former to denote it a Day of bad Succe&s;s, the latter a Day of good. Thus have the <HI>Monks</HI> in the dark and unlearned Ages of Popery copy'd after the Heathens, and dream'd them|&s;elves into the like Super&s;titions, e&s;teeming one Day more &s;ucce&s;sful than another; and &s;o according to them, it is very unlucky to begin any Work upon <HI>Childerma&s;s-Day;</HI> and what Day &s;oever that falls on, whether on a <HI>Munday, Tue&s;day,</HI> or any other, nothing mu&s;t be begun on that Day through the Year; St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Day is the Year's <HI>Fortune-Teller,</HI> St. <HI>Mark</HI>'s Day is the Progno&s;ticator of your Life and Death, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and &s;o in&s;tead of per&s;uading the People to lay a&s;ide the Whims and Fan|cies of the Heathen World, they brought them &s;o effectually in, that they are &s;till reigning in many Places to this Day.</P>
<P>But of all the Days of the Year, they could not have cho&s;en one &s;o little to the Purpo&s;e. For the very Saint, who&s;e Day is &s;o ob&s;erved,
<PB N="212" REF="230">
has him&s;elf cautioned them again&s;t any &s;uch Ob&s;ervation: For in the Fourth Chapter of his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Galations,</HI> he tells them, how dangerous it was <HI>to ob&s;erve Days, and Months, and Times, and Years;</HI> which is not, as &s;ome would per&s;uade us, to Caution us again&s;t the Ob&s;ervation of any Day but the <HI>Lord's-Day;</HI> but only that we &s;hould not ob|&s;erve the aboli&s;hed Fea&s;ts of the <HI>Jews,</HI> nor the abominable Fea&s;ts of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> nor their &s;uper&s;titious Ob&s;ervation of fortunate and unfortunate Days.

To which may be added a thou&s;and vain Ob&s;ervations, as, if any of our Members beat; if when two Friends are talking together, a Stone, or a Dog, or a Child, happens to come between them, they tread the Stone to Pieces, as the Divi|der of their Friend&s;hip, and this is toller|able
<PB N="214" REF="232">
in Compari&s;on of beating an innocent Child that comes between them. But it is more plea&s;ant, that &s;ometimes the Childrens Quarrel is revenged by the Dogs; for ma|ny Times they are &s;o &s;uper&s;titious, as to dare to beat the Dog that comes between them, who turning again upon him that &s;mites him, &s;ends him from &s;eeking a vain Remedy, to &s;eek a real Phy&s;ician indeed. Hence proceed likewi&s;e the&s;e other Super|&s;titions: For a Man to tread upon his Thre|&s;hold when he pa&s;&s;es by his own Hou&s;e, to return back to Bed again, if he chance to &s;neeze as he is putting on his Shoes; to return into his Hou&s;e, if he &s;tumble at his Going out; if the Rats knaw his Cloths, to be more terrified with the Su&s;picion of &s;ome future Evil, then concerned for the pre&s;ent Lo&s;s. He &s;ays, <HI>Cato</HI> gave a wi&s;e and &s;mart An&s;wer to &s;uch an one, who came in &s;ome Con&s;ternation to con&s;ult him, about the Rats having knawed his Stock|ings; that, &s;aid he, is no great Wonder, but it would have been a Wonder indeed, if the Stockings had knawed the Rats. St. <HI>Au&s;tin</HI> mentions this witty An&s;wer of a wi&s;e Heathen, to convince Chri&s;tians the better of the Unrea&s;onablene&s;s and Vanity of all &s;uch &s;uper&s;titious Ob&s;ervations. And he concludes, that all &s;uch Arts, whether
<PB N="215" REF="233">
of triffling or more noxious Super&s;tition, are to be rejected and avoided by Chri&s;tians, as proceeding originally from &s;ome pernicious Society between Men and Devils, and being the Compacts and Agreements of &s;uch treach|erous and deceitful Friend&s;hip. The Apo&s;tle forbids us to have Fellow&s;hip with Devils; and that, he &s;ays, re&s;pects not only Idols, and Things offered to Idols, but all imagi|nary Signs pertaining to the Wor&s;hip of Idols, and al&s;o all Remedies, and other Ob|&s;ervations, which are not appointed publick|ly by GOD to promote the Love of GOD and our Neighbour, but proceed from the private Fancies of Men, and tend to delude the Hearts of Poor deluded Mortals. For the&s;e Things have no natural Virtue in them, but owe all their Efficacy to a pre&s;umptuous Confederacy with Devils: And they are full of pe&s;tiferous Curio&s;ity, tormenting Anxi|ety, and deadly Slavery. They were fir&s;t taken up, not for any real Power to be di&s;|cerned in them, but gained their Power by Mens ob&s;erving them. And therefore by the Devil's Art they happen differently to different Men, according to their own Ap|prehen&s;ions and Pre&s;umptions. For the great Deceiver knows, how to procure Things agreeable to every Man's Temper, and en|&s;nare him by his own Su&s;picions and Con&s;ent.</Q></P>

Then they fea&s;t|ed and leaped after the Manner of <HI>Bacchanals,</HI> and danced and &s;houted as they were wont to do on their Holy-days: After this they poured into a narrow neck'd Ve&s;&s;el &s;ome of the Sea-Water, and put al&s;o into it certain Things be|longing to each of them. Then as if the Devil gifted the Girl, with the Faculty of telling future Things; they would enquire with a loud Voice, about the good or evil Fortune that &s;hould attend them: Upon this the Girl would take out of the Ve&s;&s;el, the fir&s;t Thing that came to Hand, and &s;hew it,

and give it to the Owner; who upon receiv|ing it, was &s;o fooli&s;h as to imagine him&s;elf wi&s;er, as to the good or evil Fortune that &s;hould attend him.</P>
<P>This Cu&s;tom, as he tells us a little after, is altogether diabolical: And &s;urely it was &s;o, being u&s;ed as a pre&s;age of what was future. Was the Cu&s;tom of the Lots now mention'd, u&s;ed as among the Heathens, they would no Doubt be as worthy of Condemnation; but as far as I know, there is but little Credit given to them; tho' that little is too much, and ought to be laid a&s;ide. But if the Cu|&s;tom was u&s;ed without any Mixture or Allay of Super&s;tition, as I believe it is in &s;ome Pla|ces, yet it is often attended with great Incon|veniences and Misfortunes, with Unea&s;ine&s;&s;es to Families, with Scandal, and &s;ometimes with Ruin.</P>

<P>ON the <HI>Eve of St.</HI> John Bapti&s;t, commonly called <HI>Mid&s;ummer Eve,</HI> it is u&s;ual in the mo&s;t of Country Places, and al&s;o here and there in <HI>Towns and Cities,</HI> for both Old and Young to meet together, and be Merry over a large Fire, which is made in the open Street. Over this they frequently leap and play at va|rious Games, &s;uch as Running, Wre&s;tling, Dancing, &amp;c. But this is generally the Exer|ci&s;e of the younger Sort; for the old Ones, for the mo&s;t Part, &s;it by as Spectators, and enjoy them&s;elves and their Bottle. And thus they &s;pend the Time till Mid-night, and &s;ome|times till <HI>Cock-Crow.</HI></P>

of the Way of CHRIST. But if this was the Rea&s;on of this Cu&s;tom formerly, as it's proba|ble it was, (it having been a common Thing, to &s;hadow out Times and Sea&s;ons by Em|blems;) yet the Cu&s;tom &s;till continued among us, was originally in&s;tituted upon another Bottom.</P>
<P>And indeed the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Habent hoc a gentibus, antiquitus enim dracones hoc tempore ad libidinem propter calorem excitati, volando per aerem frequenter in puteos &amp; fontes &s;permatizabant, ex quo, &amp;c.

By this Means the Water became infected, and the Air polluted; &s;o that who|ever drank the Waters, was either tormented with a grievous Di&s;temper, or lo&s;t his Life. As &s;oon as the Phycians perceived this, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> ordered Fires to be made every where about the Wells and Fountains, and tho&s;e Things which occa&s;ioned the noi&s;ome&s;t Smell to be burnt, knowing that thereby the Dragons would be driven away. And fora&s;much as this Cu&s;tom was ob&s;erved about the Time we
<PB N="273" REF="291">
now celebrate St. <HI>John Bapti&s;t</HI>'s Fea&s;t, it is therefore &s;till ob&s;erved among &s;ome People. And agreeable to this it is, that Mr. <HI>Cambden</HI> tells us, that <HI>Barnwell,</HI> a Village near <HI>Cam|bridge,</HI> got its Name from the Children play|ing about a <HI>Well</HI> on St. <HI>John Bapti&s;t's Eve.</HI></P>
<P>The Cu&s;tom of kindling &s;uch Fires, was &s;everely cen&s;ur'd by the Church: And there|fore in the <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>Trullus,</HI> this Canon was made again&s;t it,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Can. <HI>65.</HI> in Synod. Trull. ex Bal&s;, P. <HI>440.</HI></NOTE> That if any Clergy-man or Lay-man ob&s;erved the Rite of making on Fires on the <HI>New-Moon,</HI> (which &s;ome were wont to ob&s;erve, and according to an old Cu&s;tom, to leap over them in a mad and fooli&s;h Manner,) he &s;hould be depo&s;ed, if the Former, if the Latter, he &s;hould be ex|communicated.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scholia&s;t</HI> upon this <HI>Canon</HI> hath the&s;e Words: The <HI>New-Moon</HI> was always the fir&s;t Day of the Month, and it was Cu&s;tomary among the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Greeks,</HI> to hold then a Fea&s;t, and pray that they might be lucky du|ring the Continuance of the Month. Of the&s;e it was, that GOD &s;pake by the Prophet: My Soul hateth your <HI>New-Moons</HI> and your Sab|baths. And not only this, but they al&s;o kindled Fires before their Shops and Hou&s;es, and leaped over them; imagining that all the
<PB N="274" REF="292">
Evils which had befallen them formerly, would be burnt away, and that they &s;hould be more &s;ucce&s;sful and lucky afterwards. Now about the Sitting of this Synod, there were &s;ome of the Chri&s;tians, who ob&s;erved this Cu&s;tom upon the &s;ame Accounts that the Heathens did, which occa&s;ioned it's being forbid by the Council; and that if a <HI>Clergy|man</HI> was Guilty of it, he &s;hould be depo&s;ed; if a <HI>Lay-man,</HI> excommunicated. He al&s;o tells us, that on St. <HI>John Bapti&s;t's Eve,</HI> the Vul|gar were wont to make on Fires for the whole Night, and leap over them, and draw Lots, and Divine about their good or evil Fortune.</P>
<P>But whatever Rea&s;on the Heathens had for kindling the&s;e Fires; whether as <HI>Duran|dus</HI> thinks, that the lu&s;tful <HI>Dragons</HI> might be driven away, or as the <HI>Canon,</HI> that their evil Fortune might be burnt, it is certain that the Cu&s;tom was invented and practi&s;ed by them; and becau&s;e of the Super&s;tition attending the Ob&s;ervation of it, was very ju&s;tly forbidden by the Council. And undoubtedly was the Making of &s;uch Fires now, attended with any &s;uch Super&s;tition, it would be equally crimi|nal to ob&s;erve them.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXVIII.</HI> Of the Fea&s;t of Sheep-&s;hearing, an ancient Cu&s;tom.</HEAD>
<P>THE Fea&s;t of Sheep-&s;heering, is generally a Time of Mirth and Joy, and more than ordinary Ho&s;pitality; indeed it is but little ob&s;erved in the&s;e Northern Parts, but in the Southern it is pretty common. For on the Day they begin to &s;heer their Sheep, they provide a plentiful Dinner for the Sheerers, and for their Friends who come to vi&s;it them on that Occa&s;ion; a Table al&s;o, if the Wea|ther permit, is &s;pread in the open Village, for the young People and Children.</P>
<P>After what Manner &s;oever this Cu&s;tom reach'd us, it is certain it may boa&s;t of great Antiquity. It is mention'd in the Second Book of <HI>Samuel,</HI> as a Fea&s;t of great Magnifi|cence, both for Grandeur of Entertainment and Greatne&s;s of Company. No le&s;s a Per&s;on than <HI>Ab&s;alom</HI> the King's Son was the Ma&s;ter of this Fea&s;t, and no le&s;s Per&s;ons were the Gue&s;ts than the King's Sons, the Brethren of <HI>Ab&s;alom;</HI> nay it was a Fea&s;t that might enter|tain the King him&s;elf, or &s;urely the King would never have been &s;o importun'd, never would have receiv'd the Compliment &s;o kindly. For 'tis &s;aid, <HI>It came to pa&s;s after two full
<PB N="283" REF="301">
Years, that</HI> Ab&s;alom <HI>had Sheep-&s;heerers in</HI> Baal|hazor, <HI>which is be&s;ide</HI> Ephraim, <HI>and</HI> Ab&s;alom <HI>invited all the King's Sons. And</HI> Ab&s;alom <HI>came to the King, and &s;aid, Behold, now thy Servant hath Sheep-&s;heerers, let the King, I be&s;eech thee, and his Servants, go with thy Servant. And the King &s;aid, Nay, my Son, let us not all go, le&s;t we be chargeable unto thee.</HI> Of this kind al&s;o was the Fea&s;t which <HI>Nabal</HI> made for his Sheerers, when <HI>David was driven</HI> to &s;traits in the Wilderne&s;s, and &s;ent his Servants to a&s;k a Pre&s;ent of him. He calls the Day it was held on, a <HI>good Day;</HI> that is, a Day of plenti|ful Eating and Drinking. And therefore <HI>Na|bal</HI> an&s;wer'd the Servants of <HI>David, &s;hall I then take my Bread and my Water, and my fle&s;h that I have killed for my Sheerers, and give it unto Men, whom I know not whence they be?</HI> And further, it is &s;aid in the &s;ame Chapter, that &s;o grand and magnificent was this Fea&s;t, <HI>that he had a Fea&s;t in his Hou&s;e, like the Fea&s;t of a King.</HI> We find al&s;o in the Book of <HI>Gene&s;is,</HI> that <HI>Laban</HI> went to &s;heer his Sheep, in which Time <HI>Jacob</HI> made his E&s;cape, which <HI>Laban</HI> heard not of till the third Day. Of &s;uch great Antiquity then is this Cu&s;tom, and tho' its Antiquity is not of &s;uch force as to palliate Luxury and Profu&s;ene&s;s in the&s;e Entertain|ments; yet no doubt it will vindicate the Harmle&s;ne&s;s of a moderate Fea&s;t upon this Oc|ca&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXIX.</HI> Of <HI>Michaelma&s;s:</HI> Guardian Angels the Di&s;cour&s;e of Country People at this Time: That it &s;eems rather true, that we are protected by a Num|ber of Angels, than by one particular Genius.</HEAD>
<P>THE Fea&s;t of this Sea&s;on is celebrated in Commemoration of St. <HI>Michael,</HI> and all the Orders of Angels. It is called, <HI>The Dedi|cation of St. Michael,</HI> becau&s;e of a Church be|ing dedicated to him on this Day in Mount <HI>Garganus.</HI></P>
<P>At this Sea&s;on of the Year, it is a general Cu&s;tom to elect the Governors of <HI>Towns</HI> and <HI>Cities,</HI> to promote Peace among Men, and guard them again&s;t Harm from their malici|ous Fellow Creatures. Whether this particu|lar Time of the Year has been cho&s;en for e|lecting them, becau&s;e then is the Fea&s;t of An|gels, the Guardians and Protectors of Men, and of their Communities and<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Daniel, C. 1.</NOTE> Provinces, is not &s;o certain. It is certainer, that when ever it comes, it brings into the Minds of the Peo|ple, that old Opinion of <HI>Tutelar Angels,</HI> that every Man has his <HI>Guardian Angel;</HI> that is, one particular Angel who attends him from his Coming in, till his Going out of Life,
<PB N="289" REF="307">
who guides him through the Troubles of the World, and &s;trives as much as he can, to bring him to Heaven.</P>
<P>Now that good Angels attend good Men is without Di&s;pute. They guide them in the Mazes of the Wilderne&s;s of Life, and bring them to their de&s;ir'd Homes; they &s;urround them in the Seas of Afflictions, and lead them to the Shores of Peace; and as when the <HI>I&s;|raelites</HI> pa&s;&s;ed through the Red-Sea, <HI>the Cloud became Light to them, but Darkne&s;s to their Ene|mies,</HI> &s;o in the trouble&s;ome Seas of this Life, the <HI>Angels</HI> are both the Guides of good Men, and their Protectors from Evil, from the De|vil and his Angels. And therefore the P&s;al|mi&s;t &s;ays, <HI>The Angel of the LORD tarrieth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them; and that he will give his Angels Charge over good Men.</HI> They are al&s;o &s;uppo&s;ed to be that Hedge, which GOD placed about <HI>Job,</HI> which the Devil &s;o much complains of; and &s;ure we are, that when the Eyes of <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI>'s Servant were open'd, <HI>he &s;aw the Mountain full of Chariots and Hor&s;es of Fire round about</HI> Eli|&s;ha. That therefore good Men are guarded and protected by Angels the Scripture &s;hews very clearly. But that every Man has his particular <HI>Genius,</HI> &s;eems to be founded more upon Tradition, than any Certainty from Scripture. Thus the <HI>Egyptians</HI> believed that
<PB N="290" REF="308">
every Man had three Angels attending him; the <HI>Pythagoreans,</HI> that every Man had two; the <HI>Romans,</HI> that there was a good and an evil <HI>Genius.</HI> And hence it is that the <HI>Roman</HI> Poet &s;ays, <HI>Qui&s;que &s;uos patitur manes,</HI> every Man hath his evil <HI>Genius.</HI> And if we may believe the Authority of <HI>Plutarch,</HI> the evil <HI>Genius</HI> of <HI>Brutus</HI> appeared to him the Night before the Battle of <HI>Philippi,</HI> and told him he was his evil Genius, and that he would meet him there.</P>
<P>But there are greater Authorities than the&s;e in Vindication of this Opinion: <HI>Ca&s;alion</HI> ob|&s;erves, it may be proved from Scripture, and not only from the Tradition of the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Unicuique Deus cu&s;todem appo&s;uit; &amp; a&s;&s;erimus indu|bitanter nos ex &s;cripturas illam fidem, non gentium nugibus. <HI>Ca&s;&s;al.</HI> 217. <HI>P. de Vet. Chri&s;t. Ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI></NOTE> Hea|thens. And of this Opinion was <HI>Ju&s;tin Mar|tyr, Theodoret,</HI> St. <HI>Ba&s;il,</HI> St. <HI>Jerome,</HI> and St. <HI>Au&s;tin.</HI></P>
<P>There are indeed two Places in the New Te&s;tament, which have a View to this Opini|on. The fir&s;t is in the 18th of St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> the 10th Ver&s;e, <HI>Take heed that ye de&s;pi&s;e not one of the&s;e little Ones: For I &s;ay unto you, that their Angels do always behold the Face of my Father which is in Heaven.</HI> Now becau&s;e this Place takes Notice of the Angels of the&s;e little Ones, &s;ome have therefore concluded that
<PB N="291" REF="309">
every Man has his good Angel; at lea&s;t that good Men have. But now this Conclu&s;ion does not certainly follow from the&s;e Words: For when it is &s;aid <HI>their Angels,</HI> it does indeed certainly infer, that the Angels do protect good Men, but not that every Man has his particular Angel. And hence therefore, as one ob&s;erves, St. <HI>Chri&s;o&s;tom</HI> makes u&s;e of the&s;e Words, <HI>Enteuthen, delon,</HI> &amp;c. it is manife&s;t that the Saints at lea&s;t, if not all Men, have their Angels: But he does not hence conclude, that every Man has one. The other Place is in the <HI>Acts of the Apo&s;tles,</HI> where it is &s;aid, that when <HI>Peter</HI> was delivered out of Pri&s;on, they would not believe the Maid it was he, but &s;aid, <HI>It was his Angel.</HI> It mu&s;t be own'd in|deed from this, that it &s;eems the Opinion of tho&s;e in the Hou&s;e, that every Man had his <HI>Guardian Angel;</HI> but this is no Proof of the Thing's being &s;o: It only proves, that it was their Opinion, but not that this Opinion is true. The <HI>Jews</HI> had &s;uch a <HI>Tradition</HI> among them, and what was here &s;poken, was perhaps only according to that Tradition. Be&s;ides we read on the contrary, that &s;ometimes one and the &s;ame Angel has been &s;ent to different Per|&s;ons; thus <HI>Gabriel</HI> was &s;ent to <HI>Daniel, Zacha|rias,</HI> and the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin: Sometimes the Scripture tells us of many Angels protecting one Man; for &s;o was <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI> protected; and as

<P><Q>Ble&s;s, O Lord, we be&s;eech thee, this thy Creature of <HI>Eggs,</HI> that it may become a whole|&s;ome Su&s;tenance to thy faithful Servants, <HI>eating it</HI> in Thankfulne&s;s to thee, <HI>on Account of</HI> the <HI>Re|&s;urrection</HI> of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who with thee and the holy Spirit, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>The antient Egyptians, if the Re&s;urrection of the Body had been a Tenet of their Faith, would perhaps have thought an <HI>Egg</HI> no improper hierogly|phical Repre&s;entation of it.&mdash;The Exclu&s;ion of a living Creature by Incubation, after the vital Prin|ciple has lain a long while dormant or extinct, is a Proce&s;s &s;o truly marvellous, that if it could be di&s;believed, would be thought by &s;ome a Thing as incredible, as that the Author of <HI>Life</HI> &s;hould be able to re-animate the <HI>Dead.</HI></P>
<P>I conjecture that the <HI>Romani&s;ts</HI> borrowed this Cu&s;tom from the <HI>Jews,</HI> who in celebrating their Pa&s;&s;over, &s;et on the Table two unleavened Cakes, and two Pieces of the Lamb; to this they added &s;ome &s;mall Fi&s;hes, becau&s;e of the Leviathan; <HI>a

<P>This Cu&s;tom &s;till prevails in the Greek Church: Dr. Chandler, in his Travels in A&s;ia Minor, gives us the following Account of the Manner of cele|brating <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> among the modern Greeks: <Q>The Greeks now celebrated Ea&s;ter: A &s;mall Bier, prettily decked with Orange and Citron-buds, Ja&s;mine, Flowers, and Boughs, was placed in the Church, with a Chri&s;t crucified rudely painted on Board, for the Body: we &s;aw it in the Evening, and before Day Break were &s;uddenly awakened by the blaze and crackling of a large Bonefire, with &s;inging and &s;houting in Honour of the Re&s;urrection.&mdash;They <HI>made us Pre&s;ents</HI> of <HI>coloured Eggs,</HI> and Cakes of Ea&s;ter Bread.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Probably the <HI>Cro&s;s Buns</HI> made at pre&s;ent on Good Friday, have been derived from the&s;e or &s;uch like <HI>Cakes</HI> of <HI>Ea&s;ter Bread.</HI> The Country People in the North make with a Knife many little <HI>Cro&s;s-Marks</HI> on their Cakes, before they put them into the Oven, &amp;c&mdash;I have no doubt but that this too, trifling as the Remark may appear, is a <HI>Relique</HI> of <HI>Popery.</HI> Thus al&s;o per&s;ons, who cannot writ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, in&s;tead of &s;igning their Names, are bid to <HI>make their Mark,</HI> which is generally done in the form of <HI>a Cro&s;s.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P><Q><HI>Ea&s;ter Day.</HI> &s;ays the Abb&eacute; d' Auteroche in his Journey to Siberia, is &s;et apart for vi&s;iting in Ru&s;&s;ia.&mdash;A Ru&s;&s;ian came into my Room, offered me his Hand, and <HI>gave me</HI> at the &s;ame Time <HI>an Egg;</HI>&mdash;Another &s;ucceeded, he embraced me, and al&s;o <HI>gave</HI> me <HI>an Egg.</HI> I <HI>gave</HI> him in Return the <HI>Egg</HI> I had ju&s;t received.

<PB N="313" REF="331">
The People then embrace, <HI>give each other Eggs,</HI> and drink a great deal of Brandy.</Q></P>

<P>MR. Blount derives this Word from the French <HI>Pleige,</HI> a Surety, or Gage.&mdash;To pledge one drinking is generally thought to have had its Origin thus: When the Danes bore &s;way in this Land, if a Native drank, they would &s;ometimes &s;tab him with a Dagger or Knife; hereupon Peo|ple would not drink in Company,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There was an antient Cu&s;tom called a <HI>Bid-Ale</HI> or <HI>Bidder-Ale,</HI> from the Saxon <HI>Bidden</HI> to pray or &s;upplicate, when any hone&s;t Man decayed in his E&s;tate, was &s;et up again by the liberal Benevolence and Contributions of Friends at a Fea&s;t, to which tho&s;e Friends were bid or invited. It was mo&s;t u&s;ed in the We&s;t of England, and in &s;ome Counties called a <HI>Help Ale.</HI> Such In&s;tances of Benevolence are retained in the North.&mdash;At the Chri&s;tening Entertainments of many of the poor People (who are unfortunate enough to provide more <HI>Mouths</HI> than they find <HI>Meat</HI> for) great Collections are made oftentimes by the Gue&s;ts, and &s;uch as will far more than defray the Expences of the Fea&s;t of which they have been partaking.</NOTE> unle&s;s &s;ome one pre&s;ent would be their <HI>Pledge</HI> or Surety, that they &s;hould receive no Hurt, whil&s;t they were in their Draught.</P>
<P>Others affirm the true &s;en&s;e of the Word to be this: That if the Per&s;on drank unto, was not di&s;po&s;ed to drink him&s;elf, he would put another for a Pledge to do it for him, otherwi&s;e the Party who began, would take it ill.</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="361">Mr. Strutt confirms the former Opinion in the following Words: The old Manner of Pledging each other when they drank<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Such great Drinkers, &s;ays he al&s;o, were the Danes, who were in England in the Time of <HI>Edgar,</HI> and &s;o much did their bad Examples prevail with the Engli&s;h, that he, by the Advice of Dun&s;tan, Arch-Bi&s;hop of Canterbury, put down many Ale-Hou&s;es, &s;uffering only one to be in a Village, or &s;mall Town: And he al&s;o further or|dained, that <HI>Pins</HI> or <HI>Nails</HI> &s;hould be fa&s;tened into the <HI>drinking Cups</HI> and <HI>Horns at &s;tated di&s;tances,</HI> and <HI>who&s;oever</HI> &s;hould <HI>drink be|yond tho&s;e Marks at one Draught,</HI> &s;hould be obnoxious to a &s;evere Puni&s;hment. This was to prevent the pernicious Cu&s;tom of Drink|ing.</P>
<BIBL><HI>Ibid.</HI></BIBL>
<P><HI>Bumpers</HI> are of great Antiquity.&mdash; Thus Paulus Warnefridus is cited in Du Cange's Glo&s;&s;ary, telling us, in lib. 5. de ge&s;tis Langobard. Cap. 2. <Q>Cumque ii qui diver&s;i generis potiones ei a Rege deferebant, de verbo Regis eum rogarent, ut <HI>totam fialam</HI> biberent, ille in honorem Regis &s;e <HI>totam</HI> bibere promit|tens, parum aquae libabat de argenteo Calice.</Q> Vide Martial. lib. 1. Ep. 72. lib. 8. 51, &amp;c.</P>
<P>That it is good to be <HI>drunk once a Month,</HI> &s;ays the Author of the Vulgar Errors, is a common Flattery of Sen&s;uality, &s;upporting it&s;elf upon Phy&s;ic, and the healthful Effects of Inebriation.&mdash;It is a &s;triking In&s;tance of <Q>the doing <HI>ill,</HI> as we &s;ay, that <HI>good</HI> may come of it.</Q>&mdash;It <HI>may</HI> happen that Inebriation, by cau&s;ing Vomiting, may clean&s;e the Stomack, &amp;c. but it &s;eems a very dangerous Kind of Do&s;e. and of which the <HI>"repetatur hau&s;ius,"</HI> too quickly repeat|ed, will evince, that Men may pervert that, which Nature intend|ed for a <HI>Cordial,</HI> into the mo&s;t baneful of all <HI>Poi&s;ons.</HI> It has been vulgarly called, "giving a Fillip to Nature."</P>
<P>Dr. Browne is of Opinion, that the human Faces de&s;cribed in Ale-Hou&s;e <HI>Signs,</HI> in Coats of Arms, &amp;c. for the <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>Moon,</HI> are Reliques of Pagani&s;m, and that the&s;e Vi&s;ages originally impli|ed <HI>Apollo</HI> and <HI>Diana.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Chequers,</HI> at this Time a common Sign of a Public-Hou&s;e, was originally intended for a Kind of <HI>Draught-Board,</HI> called <HI>Tables,</HI> and &s;hewed that there that Game might be played. From their Colour, which was red, and the Similarity to a <HI>Lattice,</HI> it was corruptly called the <HI>Red Lettuce,</HI> which Word is frequently u&s;ed by antient Writers to &s;ignify an <HI>Ale-Hou&s;e.</HI> Vide Antiq. Repertor. Vol. I. p. 50.</P></NOTE> was thus: The Per&s;on who was going to drink, a&s;ked any one of the Company that &s;at next him, whether he
<PB N="341" REF="362">
would pledge him, on which he an&s;wering that he would, held up his Knife or Sword, to guard him whil&s;t he drank (for while a Man is drinking he nece&s;&s;arily is in an unguarded Po&s;ture, expo&s;ed to the treacherous Stroke of &s;ome hidden or &s;ecret Enemy).</P>
<P>This Cu&s;tom, as it is &s;aid, fir&s;t took ri&s;e from the Death of young King Edward, (called the Martyr) Son to Edgar, who was by the Contri|vance of Elfrida, his Step-Mother, traiterou&s;ly &s;tabbed in the Back as he was drinking.</P>
<P>Mr. Strutt's Authority here is William of Malm&s;|bury, and he ob&s;erves from the Delineation he gives, (and it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved that his <HI>Plates,</HI> being <HI>Copies</HI> from antient illuminated <HI>Manu&s;cripts,</HI> are of unque&s;tionable Authority) that it &s;eems perfectly well to agree with the reported Cu&s;tom; the middle Figure is addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to his Companion, who (&s;eems to) tell him that he pledges him, holding up his Knife in Token of his readine&s;s to a&s;&s;i&s;t and protect him.

<P>Others &s;uppo&s;e it to be &s;ome <HI>nocturnal flying In&s;ect:</HI> Indeed they have gone &s;o many different Ways in pur&s;uit of this Wanderer, that, according to the popular Notion of its conducting into Bogs and other Precipices, &s;ome of them mu&s;t have been mi&s;led and bewildered by it.&mdash;We may follow them however as far as we plea&s;e in this Paper Pur&s;uit without any Danger.</P>
<P><HI>Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iana</HI> has given us an Accout of the famous Indian Lanthorn Fly, publi&s;hed among&s;t her In&s;ects at <HI>Surinam.</HI> It has a Hood&punc; or Bladder on its Head, which gives a Light like a Lanthorn in the Night, but by Day-light is clear and tran&s;parent, curiou&s;ly adorned with Stripes of Red or Green Colour.&mdash; One may read Writing of tolerable large Character by it at Night.&mdash;The Creature, it is &s;aid, can con|tract or dilate the Hood or Bladder over its Head at Plea&s;ure.&mdash;They hide all their Light when taken, but when at Liberty afford it plentifully.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Vulgar Super&s;titions concerning the <HI>MOON.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Moon, the antient Object of idolatrous Wor&s;hip, has in later Times compo&s;ed an Article in the Creed of popular Super&s;tition: The Moon, Dr. John&s;on tells us, has great influence in vulgar Philo&s;ophy. In his Memory, he ob&s;erves, it was a Precept annually given in one of the Eng|li&s;h Almanacks, to kill Hogs when the Moon was increa&s;ing, and the Bacon would prove the better in boiling.</P>
<P>The common People, Bailey tells us, in &s;ome Counties in England are accu&s;tomed at the Prime of the Moon to &s;ay: "It is a fine Moon, God ble&s;s her," which &s;ome imagine to proceed from a blind Zeal, retained from the antient Iri&s;h, who wor&s;hip|ped the Moon, or from a Cu&s;tom in Scotland, (particularly in the Highlands) where the Women make a Curte&s;y to the New Moon: And &s;ome Engli&s;h Women &s;till retain a Touch of this Genti|li&s;m, who getting up upon and &s;itting a&s;tride on a Gate or Stile, the fir&s;t Night of the New Moon &s;ay:

<HEAD>Of <HI>SECOND SIGHT.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE learned Author of the Rambler having favoured the Public with his Thoughts on this &s;ingular Kind of Super&s;tition, and having &s;o lately vi&s;ited the Scene of its declining Influence, it will be unnece&s;&s;ary to apologize for u&s;ing his own Words on the Subject: "We &s;hould have had little claim, &s;ays he, to the Prai&s;e of Curio&s;ity, if we had not endeavoured with particular Attention to examine the Que&s;tion of the <HI>Second Sight.</HI> Of an Opinion received for Centuries by a whole Nation, and &s;uppo&s;ed to be confirmed through its whole De&s;cent, by a &s;eries of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Facts, it is de&s;irable that the Truth &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed, or the Fallacy detected.</P>
<P>The <HI>Second Sight</HI> is an Impre&s;&s;ion made either by the Mind upon the Eye, or by the Eye upon the Mind, by which Things di&s;tant or future are perceived, and &s;een as if they were pre&s;ent. A Man on a Journey far from Home falls from his Hor&s;e, another who is perhaps at work about the Hou&s;e,
<PB N="382" REF="403">
&s;ees him bleeding upon the Ground, commonly with a Land&s;cape of the Place where the Accident befalls him. Another Seer driving Home his Cat|tle, or wandering in Idlene&s;s, or mu&s;ing in the Sun|&s;hine, is &s;uddenly &s;urprized by the Appearance of a bridal Ceremony, or funeral Proce&s;&s;ion, and counts the Mourners or Attendants, of whom, if he knows them, he relates the Names, if he knows them not, he can de&s;cribe the Dre&s;&s;es. Things di&s;tant are &s;een at the In&s;tant when they happen. Of Things future I know not that there is any Rule for determining the Time between the Sight and the Event.</P>
<P>This receptive Faculty, for Power it cannot be called, is neither voluntary nor con&s;tant. The Appearances have no Dependence upon Choice: they cannot be &s;ummoned, detained, or recalled. The Impre&s;&s;ion is &s;udden, and the Effect often painful.</P>
<P>By the term Second Sight, &s;eems to be meant a Mode of &s;eeing, &s;uperadded to that which Nature generally be&s;tows. In the Ear&s;e it is called Tai&s;ch; which &s;ignifies likewi&s;e a Spectre, or a Vi&s;ion. I know not, nor is it likely that the Highlanders ever examined, whether by Tai&s;ch, u&s;ed for the Second Sight, they mean the Power of &s;eeing, or the Thing &s;een.</P>
<P>I do not find it to be true, as it is reported, that to the Second Sight nothing is pre&s;ented but Phantoms of Evil. Good &s;eems to have the &s;ame Proportion in tho&s;e vi&s;ionary Scenes, as it obtains in real Life: almo&s;t all remarkable Events have evil for their Ba&s;is; and are either Mi&s;eries incurred,
<PB N="383" REF="404">
or Mi&s;eries e&s;caped. Our Sen&s;e is &s;o much &s;trong|er of what we &s;uffer, than of what we enjoy, that the Ideas of pain predominate in almo&s;t every Mind. What is Recollection but a Revival of Vexations, or Hi&s;tory but a Record of Wars, Trea&s;ons, and Calamities? Death, which is con&s;i|dered as the greate&s;t Evil, happens to all. The greate&s;t good, be it what it will, is the Lot but of a Part.</P>
<P>That they &s;hould often &s;ee Death is to be ex|pected; becau&s;e Death is an Event frequent and important. But they &s;ee likewi&s;e more plea&s;ing Incidents. A Gentleman told me, that when he had once gone far from his own I&s;land, one of his labouring Servants predicted his Return, and de|&s;cribed the Livery of his Attendant, which he had never worn at Home; and which had been, with|out any previous De&s;ign, occa&s;ionally given him.</P>
<P>Our De&s;ire of Information was keen, and our Inquiry frequent. Mr. Bo&s;well's Frankne&s;s and Gaiety made every Body communicative; and we heard many Tales of the&s;e airy Shows, with more or le&s;s Evidence and Di&s;tinctne&s;s.</P>
<P>It is the common Talk of the Lowland Scots, that the Notion of the Second Sight is wearing away with other Super&s;titions; and that its Reality is no longer &s;uppo&s;ed, but by the gro&s;&s;e&s;t People. How far its Prevalence ever extended, or what Ground it has lo&s;t, I know not. The I&s;landers of all degrees, whether of Rank or Under&s;tanding, univer&s;ally admit it, except the Mini&s;ters, who univer&s;ally deny it, and are &s;u&s;pected to deny it, in Con&s;equence of a Sy&s;tem, again&s;t Conviction.
<PB N="384" REF="405">
One of them hone&s;tly told me, that he came to Sky with a Re&s;olution not to believe it.</P>
<P>Strong Rea&s;ons for Incredulity will readily occur. This Faculty of &s;eeing Things out of &s;ight is local, and commonly u&s;ele&s;s It is a Breach of the common Order of Things, without any vi&s;ible Rea&s;on or perceptible Benefit. It is a&s;cribed only to a People very little enlightened; and among them, for the mo&s;t Part, to the mean and the ignorant.</P>
<P>To the Confidence of the&s;e Objections it may be replied, that by pre&s;uming to determine what is fit, and what is beneficial, they pre&s;uppo&s;e more Knowledge of the univer&s;al Sy&s;tem than Man has attained; and therefore depend upon Principles too complicated and exten&s;ive for our Comprehen|&s;ion; and that there can be no Security in the Con&s;equence, when the Premi&s;es are not under|&s;tood; that the Second Sight is only wonderful becau&s;e it is rare, for, con&s;idered in it&s;elf, it in|volves no more difficulty than dreams, or perhaps than the regular Exerci&s;es of the cogitative Facul|ty; that a general Opinion of communicative Im|pul&s;es, or vi&s;ionary repre&s;entations, has prevailed in all Ages and all Nations; that particular In&s;tan|ces have been given, with &s;uch Evidence, as neither Bacon nor Bayle has been able to re&s;i&s;t; that &s;udden Impre&s;&s;ions, which the Event has ve|rified, have been felt by more than own or pub|li&s;h them; that the Second Sight of the Hebrides implies only the local Frequency of a Power, which is nowhere totally unknown; and that where we are unable to decide by antecedent Rea&s;on, we mu&s;t be content to yield to the Force of Te&s;timony.</P>
<P><PB N="385" REF="406">By preten&s;ion to Second Sight, no profit was ever &s;ought or gained. It is an involuntary Af|fection, in which neither Hope nor Fear are known to have any Part. Tho&s;e who profe&s;s to feel it, do not boa&s;t of it as a Privilege, nor are con&s;idered by others as advantageou&s;ly di&s;tingui&s;hed. They have no temptation to feign; and their hearers have no motive to encourage the Impo&s;ture.</P>
<P>To talk with any of the&s;e Seers is not ea&s;y. There is one in Sky, with whom we would have gladly conver&s;ed; but he was very gro&s;s and ig|norant, and knew no Engli&s;h. The Proportion in the&s;e Countries of the Poor to the Rich is &s;uch, that if we &s;uppo&s;e the Quality to be accidental, it can very rarely happen to a Man of Education; and yet on &s;uch Men it has &s;ometimes fallen. There is now a Second Sighted Gentleman in the Highlands, who complains of the Terrors to which he is expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The fore&s;ight of the Seers is not always pre|&s;cience: they are impre&s;&s;ed with Images, of which the Event only &s;hews them the Meaning. They tell what they have &s;een to others, who are at that Time not more knowing than them&s;elves, but may become at la&s;t very adequate Witne&s;&s;es, by comparing the Narrative with its Verification.</P>
<P>To collect &s;ufficient Te&s;timonies for the Satis|faction of the Publick, or our&s;elves, would have required more Time than we could be&s;tow. There is, again&s;t it, the &s;eeming Analogy of Things con|fu&s;edly &s;een, and little under&s;tood; and for it, the indi&s;tinct Cry of national Per&s;ua&s;ion, which may be perhaps re&s;olved at la&s;t into Prejudice and Tra|dition.

<HEAD>Of <HI>DREAMS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>EVERY Dream, according to Wolfius, takes its Ri&s;e from &s;ome Sen&s;ation, and is continu|ed by the Succe&s;&s;ion of Phanta&s;ms in the Mind: His Rea&s;ons are, that when we dream, we imagine &s;omething, or the Mind produces Phanta&s;ms; but no Phanta&s;ms can ari&s;e in the Mind without a previous Sen&s;ation, hence neither can a Dream ari&s;e without &s;ome previous Sen&s;ation.</P>
<P>Lord Bacon ob&s;erves, that the Interpretation of natural Dreams has been much laboured, but mixed with numerous Extravagancies, and adds, that at pre&s;ent it &s;tands not upon its be&s;t Founda|tion. It may be ob&s;erved that in our Days, except among&s;t the mo&s;t ignorant and vulgar, the whole imaginary Structure is fallen to the Ground.</P>
<P>Phy&s;icians &s;eem to be the only Per&s;ons at pre|&s;ent who interpret Dreams: frightful Dreams are perhaps always Indications of &s;ome violent Oppre&s;|&s;ion of Nature.

<P>The <HI>Morris-Dance,</HI> in which Bells are gingled, or Staves, or Swords cla&s;hed, was learned, &s;ays Dr. John&s;on, by the Moors, and was probably a Kind of Pyrrhick or Military Dance.</P>

<P>I find the following elegant De&s;cription of <HI>Duck</HI> and <HI>Drake</HI> in an antient Church Writer: &mdash; The Antiquity of this puerile Sport will appear by the &s;ub&s;equent Extract from Minucius Felix: "Pueros videmus certatim ge&s;tientes, te&s;tarum in mare jacu|lationibus ludere.
