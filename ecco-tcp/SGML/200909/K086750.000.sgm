<P>OF this Knowledge likewi&s;e the
<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">A&s;aph.</NOTE> Author of this P&s;alm had a large Share;
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Patric. Comment.</NOTE> who&s;e Words King <HI>Hezekiah</HI>
<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">2 Chron. xxix. 30.</NOTE> commanded the Levites to make u&s;e of, with tho&s;e of <HI>David,</HI> in the Hou&s;e of the Lord. &mdash; He was fully &s;en&s;ible
<PB N="2" REF="6">that the Obedience God requires from Men is that of the Heart &mdash; The Sacrifice of their Wills; far more plea&s;ing to him than Incen&s;e or
<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. xv. 22.</NOTE> <HI>the Fat of the Rams.</HI></P>
<P>AND the Rea&s;on of this is evident: For, if a Man reflects, He will find, that his Will is that alone which he can properly call his own, and therefore the only Sacrifice he can offer unto the Almighty. To offer unto him Burnt-offerings,
<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">P&s;al.</NOTE> <HI>the Bullock out of thine Hou&s;e, or He-Goat out of thy Flock,</HI> is to offer unto him what is his own; &s;ince <HI>all the Bea&s;ts of the Fore&s;t are his, and &s;o are the Cattle upon a Thou&s;and Hills. I know,</HI> &s;ays God, <HI>all the Fowls upon the Mountains, and the wild Bea&s;ts of the Field are in my Sight. If I be hungry I will not tell thee, for the whole World is mine, and all that is therein. Thinke&s;t thou that I will eat Bull's Fle&s;h, and drink the Blood of Goats?</HI> Then it follows (as a full Declaration of what Sacrifice God is delighted with, and a Command moreover to perform the &s;ame) <HI>Offer unto God Thank&s;|giving.</HI></P>
<P>NOTHING but &s;upine Indolence, and the utmo&s;t Indifference to Things of a &s;piritual Nature, can make this Duty &s;o neglected
<PB N="3" REF="7">among Men, and &s;uffer the Goodne&s;s of God to pa&s;s away with &s;o little Regard. The Mercies which he is plea&s;ed, each Day to confer upon us, &s;eem to have no other Effect (with the Generality I mean) that to make us confident of a Succe&s;&s;ion of them the follow|ing Day: No other Effect, than to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in flattering our&s;elves, that we are the peculiar People of God; and to teach us to pre&s;ume, that he, who hath ever been mindful of us, will ever continue to be &s;o. &mdash; Yet this is not the Whole of the Ca&s;e &mdash; For it is ob&s;ervable that tho&s;e Per&s;ons, who are &s;o unmindful of the Ble&s;&s;ings of God, who permit &s;uch re|peated In&s;tances of his Mercy to &s;lip out of their Minds, without any Mention, or Ac|knowledgment of them, are the fir&s;t to com|plain, and murmur, if an Accident di&s;ap|points their Schemes and De&s;igns, or any thing falls out contrary to their Wi&s;hes and Inclinations. &mdash; Surely, this is a mo&s;t notori|ous Indication what Strangers we are to God, and the Ways of his Providence; and how wholly our Minds are bu&s;ied and delighted with the Affairs of this World!</P>
<P>A SIGNAL Act indeed of Mercy, a Mark of God's &s;pecial Providence will rai&s;e in many Men a &s;udden Spirit of Gratitude; a certain
<PB N="4" REF="8">Warmth, and Eagerne&s;s to give Prai&s;e unto God. &mdash; But &s;oon does that Spirit &s;ub&s;ide. &mdash; Variety of Diver&s;ions and Hurry of Bu&s;ine&s;s quickly damp that Fire, and introduce Luke-warmne&s;s and Indifference. &mdash; But if the Ble&s;|&s;ing receiv'd be remembered for a Time; it is often remembered in wanton Gratitude, ex|pre&s;s'd by un&s;eemly Mirth and Jollity, and mo&s;t frequently ending in Exce&s;s and Intem|perance. &mdash; So evident is that Truth; That if the common and daily Mercies of God cannot awaken in us a Spirit of Gratitude, neither &s;hall we be per&s;uaded to a con&s;tant Practice of this Duty, tho' the mo&s;t extraordinary Act of Mercy were wrought in that Behalf.</P>
<P>THANKSGIVING is di&s;tingui&s;h'd from Prai&s;e as it is a more confin'd Duty; or rather a Part of that general one. &mdash; It has re&s;pect to tho&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings and Mercies which concern our&s;elves; whereas Prai&s;e terminates in God, with re|gard to his own great, and infinite Per|fections.</P>
<P>THANKSGIVING con&s;i&s;ts in a grateful Sen&s;e of any Mercy we have receiv'd from God; expre&s;s'd by &s;uch outward Signs as are mo&s;t agreeable to our Joy &mdash; It implies not only a pre&s;ent Acknowledgment of his Favours, but &s;uch a con&s;tant Remembrance of them,
<PB N="5" REF="9">that no worldly Honours, or Succe&s;s can de|face, or blot out of our Minds. &mdash; Moreover, it includes a due Reflection on tho&s;e Favours, and requires, that we &s;et a ju&s;t Value on them; omitting no Circum&s;tance that may heighten their Excellence &mdash; But this Duty is be&s;t expre&s;s'd when the Mercies of God excite in us a Love and Reverence of his Name, and an hearty De&s;ire, and &s;incere Endeavour to pre&s;ent our&s;elves
<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Rom. xii. 1.</NOTE> <HI>a living Sacrifice holy ac|ceptable unto him.</HI></P>
<P>HEREIN con&s;i&s;ts the Duty of Thank&s;giving &mdash; How rea&s;onable an one it is, every Man mu&s;t at once confe&s;s, when he con&s;iders to whom it is to be paid &mdash; To him who fir&s;t gave and &s;till continues our Being &mdash; To him who hath created all Things in Heaven and Earth for our Comfort and Convenience &mdash;
<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Jam. i. 5.</NOTE> <HI>Who giveth liberally, and upbraideth not,</HI> re|quiring, as a Return for his Kindne&s;s, the Ac|knowledgment of it; and the Performance of &s;ome Duties, that are by no means difficult to practi&s;e &mdash; Who&s;e Providence watches over us, at all Times, in every Place, and under all Circum&s;tances, when we are ra&s;h and incon|&s;iderate, when we are carele&s;s and negligent, and when we are buried in Sleep, and cannot
<PB N="6" REF="10">&s;o much as think how to &s;ecure our&s;elves, or any thing belonging to us &mdash; Who is &s;o gra|cious as to call us his Friends, and under that endearing Relation, to admit us to a free In|tercour&s;e with him&s;elf; permitting us to call him Father, and to make known our Reque&s;ts unto him, by Prayer and Supplication &mdash; Who with an Eye of Pity beholds our Sorrows, re|lieves our Wants, a&s;&s;i&s;ts our Infirmities, and &s;ends us Strength and Patience to &s;upport our|&s;elves under Tryals and Afflictions. &mdash; But, a|bove all, who hath &s;ent his only begotten Son, from his own right Hand, into the World, to take upon him our Nature, and its Infir|mities; to die in our &s;tead, and by his Death to make us Inheritors of Life and Glory; and who, when, through our manifold Tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ions, we provoke him to Wrath, at the In|terce&s;&s;ion of his Son, does &s;till forgive us, and &s;uffers not his Di&s;plea&s;ure to ari&s;e.</P>
<P>THERE is one Circum&s;tance which mu&s;t greatly recommend this Duty to us, and that is, its Excellence. &mdash; We cannot pay a more acceptable Service to our Lord than Thank&s;|giving: A &s;ervice which, of all others, he is mo&s;t delighted with: Nay, which he is plea|&s;ed to di&s;tingui&s;h in a very peculiar manner;
<PB N="7" REF="11">
<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">P&s;. l. 23.</NOTE> <HI>Who&s;o offereth me Thanks and Prai&s;e he ho|noureth me.</HI> Honoureth God? &mdash; How em|phatically does this Expre&s;&s;ion &s;et forth the Excellence of Thank&s;giving, and graciou&s;ly encourage us in the Performance of the Duty? Let it not then be termed a mercenary one; let it not be con&s;trued to proceed from Selfi&s;h|ne&s;s; &s;ince there cannot be that Principle in any Man's Heart, who makes the utmo&s;t Re|turn he is able, for a Benefit receiv'd.&mdash; No, Selfi&s;hne&s;s is the Parent of Ingratitude; a Sin mo&s;t unpardonable in us, and mo&s;t de|te&s;table in the Sight of God. But Thankful|ne&s;s proceeds from another Principle; a Prin|ciple of Love deriv'd to us from the Fountain of Love, God him&s;elf.&mdash; It is not an Addre&s;s of Intere&s;t, a Petition to him for more Ble&s;|&s;ings; 'tis an humble Acknowledgment of his excellent Mercy and Goodne&s;s, in what he has already be&s;towed.</P>
<P>THE Rea&s;ons and Occa&s;ions of the Duty, mu&s;t, of nece&s;&s;ity, make it a plea&s;ant one: Becau&s;e the Recollection of every Mercy is a kind of &s;econd Enjoyment. We are a&s;&s;ur'd by one who was very conver&s;ant in it, that,
<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ib. cxlvii 1.</NOTE> <HI>it is a joyful and plea&s;ant Thing to be thankful.</HI> It mu&s;t be&s;ides admini&s;ter great Delight to
<PB N="8" REF="12">the Mind, as it enlarges its Powers, and rai|&s;es it from low and trifling Objects, which darken and deba&s;e it, to that great and noble one, the Divine Being.</P>
<P>SUCH is the Nature, Rea&s;onablene&s;s and Excellence of Thank&s;giving; a Duty requir|ed from, and incumbent upon all &s;ince all have ta&s;ted of the Mercies of God.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame Obligations which affect every Individual, for the particular In&s;tances of Kindne&s;s &s;hewn to him, will re&s;pectively af|fect all Communities and Bodies of Men, and con&s;equently all States, and Kingdoms.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd by our&s;elves, and all others who are acquainted with our Hi&s;tory, that this Nation has experienced the mo&s;t &s;en|&s;ible Marks of the Divine Favour; has been mo&s;t &s;ignally and wonderfully pre&s;erv'd, in Times, both of the greate&s;t Danger, and mo&s;t extreme Nece&s;&s;ity.&mdash;The God of Ho&s;ts has often gone out with us to Battle. &mdash;</P>
<P>YEA,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We had, at this Time, receiv'd the welcome News of the taking the Forts and Ca&s;tles of <HI>Carthagena,</HI> and were in expe|ctation of &s;oon hearing that the Town it&s;elf was taken.</NOTE> at this In&s;tant (I &s;peak with all due Deference) we have &s;ome Rea&s;on to believe, that

<P>THIS is a Mercy, not which our Fathers have told us; but which we do now &s;ee and hear; and which loudly calls for our mo&s;t de|vout Thanks to the Author: And with them our further Prayers that he would be pleas'd to continue to us his Favours, and to pre&s;erve that Great Man, Who, truly &s;ollicitous for the public Good, left his Ea&s;e and Retirement, to enter upon a painful and hazardous Expe|dition; Who departed not in the Spirit of Re|venge, but with an Heart full of Courage, and Re&s;olution, equalled only by his Prudence, and Moderation: In Who&s;e generous, and ho|ne&s;t Brea&s;t the Love of his Country appears to be the governing Principle, and Who &s;eems to rejoice, that it hath plea&s;ed God to make him the In&s;trument of recovering its ju&s;t Rights; of cha&s;ti&s;ing a faithle&s;s and in&s;olent Enemy.</P>
<P><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">After two rigorous Winter Sea&s;ons (the fir&s;t of which was very remarkable) and a long exce&s;&s;ive Drought, when our old Stores were greatly exhau&s;ted, and a mo&s;t melancholly Pro&s;pect before us, it plea&s;ed God to &s;end a great Rain, which was uni|ver&s;al, and has produced one of the mo&s;t plentiful Harve&s;ts, ever known in this Kingdom.</NOTE> ANOTHER Mercy, for which we, at this Time, &s;tand obliged to our Gracious Pre&s;er|ver, is that glorious Pro&s;pect of the Fruits of

<P>THE be&s;t Method by which we can mo&s;t rea&s;onably hope to &s;ee our De&s;ires an&s;wer'd, to behold the Completion of the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings, is gratefully to acknowledge tho&s;e In&s;tances of the Divine Goodne&s;s, which were &s;hewn to us heretofore. &mdash; Of the&s;e, none more de&s;erves our be&s;t and heartie&s;t Thanks, than the great Deliverance of this Day: Which, it is to be hop'd, will be had in Remembrance, as long as that Con&s;titution &s;hall la&s;t which was re|e&s;tabli&s;h'd by it.</P>
<P>To remember this Mercy is not the Work of the Lips, but of the Heart. &mdash; It is to re|flect,
<PB N="11" REF="15">with Seriou&s;ne&s;s upon it; to learn how to value it; and to look into every Circum|&s;tance that may help to &s;hew us the true Va|lue of it.&mdash;It is to draw &s;uch Inferences from it that may direct our Practice, and a&s;&s;i&s;t us in the &s;everal Duties of Life.&mdash;To entertain from thence ju&s;t Notions of the Relations we bear to each other, and of the Obligations ari&s;ing from &s;uch Relations. &mdash; Particularly, To learn from thence Obedience to the King, and all that are put in Authority under him: To en|deavour to pre&s;erve the Peace and good Order of the Community in which we live: To &s;hew good Offices to our Friends and Neighbours, and to bear a good Will towards all Men; To re&s;train every inordinate and turbulent Pa&s;&s;ion in our Minds that may incline us to change, or lead us beyond the Bounds of Equity, Truth, and Rea&s;on. &mdash; Above all, To love and fear, and honour him who is King of Kings and Lord of Lords, and to frequent the Ser|vice of that Church, which his Providence hath e&s;tabli&s;hed in the&s;e Kingdoms.</P>
<P>THE Ble&s;&s;ing, which we, this Day, &s;tand &s;o greatly indebted to Almighty God for, is
<Q>The having put an end to the great Rebel|lion by the Re&s;titution of the King, and Royal Family, and the Re&s;tauration of the Go|vernment, after many Year's Interruption.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="16">To be &s;en&s;ible of the great Value of this Ble&s;&s;ing we need only look into the Hi&s;tory of that time, and reflect on the Anarchy, and Con|fu&s;ion that then over&s;pread the whole Nation.</P>

<PB N="16" REF="20">would have look'd upon the Confu&s;ion, that preceded the Re&s;toration, with Plea&s;ure and Complacency: And what a Friend to his Country, &s;uch an one is like to prove, the meane&s;t Capacity may judge.&mdash; Every Sati&s;|faction we enjoy, every new Acqui&s;ition we make, every thing that is dear to us, more e&s;pecially our Religion and Liberties, are de|rived to us from thence.&mdash;To be in&s;en&s;ible therefore of this Ble&s;&s;ing, were to act mo&s;t ab|&s;urdly indeed, were to indicate that we are even Enemies to our own &s;elves.</P>
<P>HE, who&s;e licentious Tongue, in&s;tructed and directed by a wicked Heart, can rail at, object again&s;t, and vilify the truly happy Day we are now remembring, &s;hould con&s;ider (if nothing el&s;e can &s;top his Virulence and De|traction) that he is obliged to that Day's Suc|ce&s;s for the very Freedom of Speech he is pleas'd &s;o intemperately to make u&s;e of.</P>
<P>I KNOW not how far Men may be carried by their Humours and Pa&s;&s;ions; How far an Affectation of Singularity may incline &s;ome, how far a Spirit of Party may compel others, and how far Indifference and the Di&s;tance of Time may be a Cau&s;e in more, of omitting this their Sacrifice of Prai&s;e and Thank&s;giving; but this may be &s;aid with &s;ome Degree of A&s;&s;urance, That no one, who has
<PB N="17" REF="21">a due Regard for the Honour and Dignity of the Crown, a tender Concern and temperate Zeal for the E&s;tabli&s;hed Church, and an Heart glowing with the Love of Liberty, that no one can, con&s;i&s;tently with the&s;e Principles, neg|lect his Duty on this Day, and be blamele&s;s. &mdash; If a Man will be &s;earching for Excu&s;es, the only po&s;&s;ible Method, by which he can requit him&s;elf in this Ca&s;e, is to doubt the Truth of the Fact: A Scheme, which may not &s;eem &s;o full of Ab&s;urdity, if Sceptici&s;m in Hi&s;tory be as flagrant as it is in Religion.</P>
<P>&mdash; Neither do I &s;ee with what Rea&s;on any one can in&s;inuate him&s;elf into another's Fa|vour, by Mi&s;repre&s;entations of the important Tran&s;action of that Day, and by depreciating the Character of the King, then re&s;tor'd. With Men of hone&s;t and generous Principles, it has ever been held a Mark of a mean &s;pi|rit, to commend one Man by a&s;per&s;ing ano|ther. How much more then is it a &s;ign of ba&s;e Servitude, to extol one Prince (who&s;e Virtues are too well known to need &s;uch low Helps) at the Expence of deba&s;ing another, who wore the &s;ame Crown before him! It amounts to more than a Suppo&s;ition, that he, who can be guilty of &s;uch Behaviour, would, at a fit Opportunity, and under favourable Circum|&s;tances, turn a vile Traitor, and even whet
<PB N="18" REF="22">his Sword again&s;t the Gracious Sovereign now &s;et over us. As it is our Duty to pay the greate&s;t Reverence to his &s;acred Per&s;on, &s;o let the Memory of the other be ever dear unto us: Of Him, who, as on this Day, return'd to his Kingdom, with the univer&s;al Acclama|tions of his People, rejoicing with one Heart and united Hands, to &s;ee their antient, their be&s;t Con&s;titution re&s;tor'd; to behold, once again, the glorious Face of Monarchy, Epi&s;|copacy, and Liberty.</P>
<P>IT has plea&s;ed God, out of his abundant Mercy, to prolong the Lives of &s;ome Per&s;ons, who were Eye-witne&s;&s;es of that happy Day, even to the&s;e Times. But had we no living Evidence of it, were the Di&s;tance of Time much greater than it is, yet a Mercy &s;o &s;ignal, and &s;o excellent, can never be forgotten by us. We cannot, without Forfeiture of our Rea|&s;on, omit religiou&s;ly ob&s;erving a Day, the joyful Effects of which we are every Mo|ment &s;en&s;ible of. More e&s;pecially in this great and renown'd City, which the re&s;t of the Kingdom &s;eem &s;o indu&s;trious to copy af|ter, let this Day be ever held &s;acred. It were to degenerate from the Spirit of our Ance&s;tors not to acknowledge that Work with Joy, which they were &s;o &s;ollicitous about, and which, under the Direction of Provi|dence,
<PB N="19" REF="23">they were &s;o remarkably in&s;trumental in bringing to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>I WOULD u&s;e one Word more of Ex|hortation, which is, That we take care to in&s;til into tho&s;e that come after, the &s;ame Sen&s;e of this Mercy, the &s;ame Spirit of Gratitude, which we our&s;elves feel;
