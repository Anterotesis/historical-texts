<P>IF the Nightingale be the &s;ong&s;ter of the grove, the Canary
Finch is the mu&s;ician of the chamber. The melody of the former is derived
from Nature alone, that of the latter is directed and improved by our
in&s;tructions. With a weaker voice, with le&s;s extent of modulation, with
le&s;s variety of notes, the Canary Finch has a finer ear, greater facility of
imitation<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"> The Canary learns to &s;peak, and
articulate many little names very di&s;tinctly. . . . By means of a flageolet,
it can acquire two or three airs, which it chants in their proper tone, always
keep|ing due time, &amp;c. 
<BIBL><HI>Trait&eacute; des Serius des Canaries, par
Hervieux,</HI> 1713.</BIBL> A Canary, which, when young, was placed very near
my de&s;k, got an odd &s;orc of &s;ong; it imitated the &s;ound made by telling
crowns. 
<BIBL><HI>Note communicated by Hebert, receiver general at
Dijon.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>, and <PB N="2" REF="15"> a more retentive memory;
and, as the charac|ters of animals depend principally on the quality of their
perceptions, this delicate bird, alive to every impre&s;&s;ion, becomes al&s;o
more &s;ocial, more gentle; forms acquaintance, and even &s;hews
attachment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It becomes &s;o familiar and &s;o fond of
care&s;&s;ing, that a thou&s;and and a thou&s;and times it comes to ki&s;s and
bill its ma&s;ter, and never &s;ails to an&s;wer his call. 
<BIBL><HI>Trait&eacute; des Serins, par M.
Hervieux.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. Its care&s;&s;es are amiable, its little pets are
innocent, and its anger neither hurts nor offends. Its habits too approach
nearer to our own; it feeds on grain, like the other do|me&s;tic birds; it is
more ea&s;ily bred than the Nightingale, which lives only on fle&s;h and
in|&s;ects, and which requires its meals to be pur|po&s;ely prepared. Its
education is attended al&s;o with greater &s;ucce&s;s; it readily lays a&s;ide
the me|lody of its native airs to adopt the harmony of our voices and
in&s;truments; it eagerly follows the notes, and improves and heightens their
delicacy. The Nightingale, proud of its independent warble, &s;eems de&s;irous
to pre&s;erve its purity; at lea&s;t, he &s;lights our mu&s;ic, and can hardly
be brought to learn a few &s;ongs. The Canary Finch prattles or whi&s;tles; but
the Nightingale de&s;pi&s;es what he deems the perver&s;ion of his talents, and
perpetually recurs to the rich beauties of Nature. <PB N="3" REF="16"> His
ever-varied &s;ong can never be altered by man; that of the Canary Finch is
more pliant, and can be modelled by our ta&s;te. The one therefore contributes
more than the other to the comforts of &s;ociety; the Canary Finch &s;ings at
all times, recreates our &s;pirits in the gloomie&s;t weather, and even adds to
our happine&s;s; it amu&s;es all young people, and is the delight of the
reclu&s;e; it relieves the languors of the cloi&s;ter, and infu&s;es
cheerfulne&s;s into innocent and captive minds; and its little loves, which are
manife&s;t when it breeds, have a thou&s;and and a thou&s;and times awakened
the tenderne&s;s of feeling hearts. It is as u&s;eful, as the Vulture is

head, and the higher part of the wings, are mixed with green, jonquil, and
black. The back, and the re&s;t of the wings, are da&s;hed with green, gray,

waved. The &s;pots &s;cattered on the plumage of the Cini are not di&s;tinctly
marked, but run into each other; tho&s;e on the head are much finer, and like

me; a per&s;on of as much experience as veracity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Father Bougot.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<Q> 
<P>"For thirty years pa&s;t I have rai&s;ed many of the&s;e &s;mall
birds, and have paid particular atten|tion to breeding them; I can therefore
from long ob&s;ervation a&s;&s;ert the following facts. When we wi&s;h to pair
Canaries with Goldfinches, we mu&s;t take the Goldfinches at ten or twelve days
old, and put them in the ne&s;t with Canaries of the &s;ame age; we mu&s;t
rai&s;e them together in the &s;ame volery, and accu&s;tom them to the &s;ame
food. It is u&s;ual to lodge the male Goldfinches with the female Canaries, and
they a&s;&s;ociate much more readily than if the female Gold|finches were
joined with the male Canaries. We may ob&s;erve however, that the union is more
tardy, becau&s;e the Goldfinch is later in pairing than the Canary; on the
contrary, if the female Goldfinch be placed be&s;ide the male Canary they
&s;ooner couple<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This proves (as we &s;hall
afterwards ob&s;erve) that the female is not &s;o much &s;timulated to love by
nature, as rou&s;ed by the &s;olici|tation of the male.</NOTE>. To &s;ucceed we
mu&s;t never admit the male Canary into the voleries where there are female
Canaries, for he would then prefer them to Goldfinches<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ge&s;ner &s;ays, that a Swi&s;s bird-catcher trying to pair a cock
Canary with a hen <HI>Sarzerine,</HI> (Cini,) had eggs, but that the&s;e were
addle.</NOTE>."</P> 
<P> <PB N="11" REF="24"> "With regard to the union of the male
Ca|nary with the female Si&s;kin, I am certain that it &s;ucceeds well. I have
kept for nine years in my volery a female Si&s;kin, which never failed to make
three hatches annually for the fir&s;t five years, though the number was
reduced to two in the four following years. I have other Si&s;|kins which have
bred with the Canaries, with|out being rai&s;ed or kept &s;eparately. We need
only leave the male or female Si&s;kin in the chamber with a good number of
Canaries, and we &s;hall perceive them pair with the Canaries, at the &s;ame
time that the&s;e pair with each other; whereas, to &s;ucceed with the
Goldfinches, they mu&s;t be &s;hut up in a cage with the Canary, and every bird
of the &s;ame &s;pecies mu&s;t be excluded. The Si&s;kin lives as long as the
Canary, and eats the &s;ame food with much le&s;s reluctance than the
Goldfinch.</P> 
<P> "I have al&s;o put Linnets with Canaries; but there is &s;eldom
&s;ucce&s;s, unle&s;s we lodge the male Linnet with the female Canary; for the
hen Linnet makes no ne&s;t, but drops her eggs in the cage, and the&s;e are
generally addle. I have made the experiment with them, having placed them under
female Canaries, and frequently found that they did not hatch.</P> 
<P>"It is very difficult to pair Chaffinches and Yellow-hammers
with Canaries. I have kept for three years a female Yellow-hammer with a male
Canary, and it has laid only addle <PB N="12" REF="25"> eggs. This has al&s;o
been the ca&s;e with the female Chaffinch; but when the female Canary is
covered by the male Chaffinch and Yellow|hammer &s;he has prolific eggs."</P></Q>
<P>From the&s;e facts, and &s;ome others which I have collected, it
appears that the Si&s;kin is the only bird of which the male and female
propa|gate equally with tho&s;e of the male or female Canaries. The female
Canary al&s;o breeds rea|dily with the Goldfinch; not &s;o ea&s;ily with the
cock Linnet; and even produces, though with more difficulty, under the male
Chaffinches, Yel|low-hammers, and Sparrows; whereas the male Canaries cannot
impregnate the females of the&s;e la&s;t. Nature is therefore more uniform and
permanent in the male than in the female; in the former the characters are
deeply imprinted; in the latter, the qualities are modified by the influence of
external cau&s;es. In the few experi|ments which I have made on the union of
&s;ome contiguous &s;pecies of quadrupeds, I ob&s;erved that the ewe ea&s;ily
bred under the he-goat; but that the ram could not propagate upon the
&s;he-goat. I have been told of an in&s;tance in which a &s;tag covered a cow;
but the bull has been known to copulate with the hind. The mare breeds more
readily with the jack-a&s;s, than the &s;he-a&s;s with the &s;tallion. In
general, mules par|take more of the characters of the female than of the male,
who&s;e features are more &s;trongly marked.&mdash;The&s;e facts corre&s;pond
with tho&s;e we <PB N="13" REF="26"> have mentioned with regard to the
cro&s;s-breed of birds. It is evident that the female Canary is much more
related than the male to the &s;pecies of the Yellow-hammer, of the Linnet, of
the Chaf|finch, and of the Sparrow; &s;ince it breeds with all the&s;e, while
the male will not. I u&s;e the term <HI>will,</HI> for perhaps it is only from
a want of re&s;olution that the female yields to the &s;olicita|tions of
tho&s;e of a different &s;pecies: however, an examination of the products of
this inter|mixture affords conclu&s;ions that agree with all that I have &s;aid
of the generation and develope|ment of animals; and as the &s;ubject is
import|ant, I &s;hall here &s;tate the principal facts.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t variety which &s;eems to con&s;titute two di&s;tinct
families in the &s;pecies, con&s;i&s;ts of the variegated Canaries, and tho&s;e
who&s;e plu|mage is uniform. The white &s;ort, or the yel|low-citron, are never
variegated; only when the latter are four or five years old, the tips of the
wings and of the tail become white. The gray kind are not of an uniform colour;
&s;ome feathers are affected by different &s;hades, and &s;ome individuals are
of a lighter or of a darker tinge. The agate is &s;pread uniformly, though it
varies in the inten&s;ity. The pink coloured are more &s;imilar, the tint being
uniform, not only in different individuals, but in different parts of the
&s;ame individual. In tho&s;e which con&s;i&s;t of &s;everal colours, the
Yellow Jonquil &s;ort are varie|gated with blacki&s;h, and are commonly black
on <PB N="14" REF="27"> the head. In &s;ome Canaries, the plumage is tinctured
with all the &s;imple colours which we have mentioned; but the Yellow Jonquil
are the mo&s;t variegated with black.</P>
<P>When Canaries are paired of an uniform colour, that of their
young is al&s;o uniform. If both parents are gray, for in&s;tance, the progeny
is al&s;o commonly gray; and this is the ca&s;e with the pink, with the white,
with the yellow, and with the agate. If the parents be of different colours,
the fruits of their commerce will have a richer plumage; and as the
combinations that can take place are numerous, an immen&s;e va|riety of tints
may be produced. But when the Canaries of an uniform colour are cro&s;&s;ed
with tho&s;e which are variegated, the changes are pro|digiou&s;ly multiplied,
and there is &s;carce any limit to the &s;portive modifications. Nay, it often
happens that parents of an uniform colour have beautiful variegated offspring,
derived from the mixture of &s;hades in them&s;elves or their progenitors<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To have beautiful birds, we mu&s;t pair the flaxen
variegated male with a white-tailed yellow female; or at lea&s;t a variegated
male with a white-tailed flaxen female, or any other female that is
white-tailed, except only the gray. And when we want to ob|tain a fine Jonquil,
we &s;hould &s;et a black variegated male with a white-tailed yellow female.

has the &s;tronge&s;t voice, and appears to be the mo&s;t vi|gorous, and the
mo&s;t ardent in propagation; it is &s;ufficient for three female Canaries, and
while they are &s;itting in the ne&s;ts, it &s;upplies them and their young
with food. The Si&s;kin and the Goldfinch are neither &s;o powerful nor &s;o
a&s;&s;idu|ous, and a &s;ingle female Canary &s;atisfies their appetite.</P>
<P>The cro&s;s-breed of the Cini, of the Si&s;kin, and of the

longer, and their notes are fuller and more &s;onorous; but they are &s;lower
in receiving in&s;truction: for the mo&s;t part, they whi&s;tle imperfectly,
and &s;eldom one can be found that can repeat a &s;ingle air com|plete.</P>
<P>When we wi&s;h to have a breed of the Goldfinch with the hen
Canary, the former &s;hould be two years old, and the latter one, for the
Canary arrives &s;ooner at maturity. It will be better if both be reared
together, though that precaution is not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; and the
Author of "the Treati&s;e on Canaries" is mi&s;|taken in a&s;&s;erting, that
the hen mu&s;t never have had commerce with a male of her own &s;pecies, and
that this would prevent her from receiving tho&s;e of a different kind. The
following fact is directly contrary to this opinion: 
<Q REND="inline">"I hap|pened," &s;ays Father Bougot, "to put
twelve Ca|naries together, four males and eight females. <PB N="16" REF="29">
Bad chickweed killed three of the&s;e males, and all the females lo&s;t their
fir&s;t hatch. In the &s;tead of the&s;e Cock-Canaries, I thought of
&s;ub&s;titut|ing three male Goldfinches which I caught, and put them into the
volery in the beginning of May. I had, towards the end of July, two ne&s;ts of
young, which thrived as well as po&s;&s;ible; and in the following year, I had
three hatches of each cock Goldfinch with the female Ca|naries. The&s;e
commonly do not breed with the Goldfinch, except from the age of one to four;
while they continue prolific with their own males till eight or nine: and it is
only the variegated female that breeds with the Goldfinch after its fourth
year. We mu&s;t never put the Goldfinch into a volery, for it demo|li&s;hes the
ne&s;ts, and breaks the eggs of the other birds."</Q> It appears then that the
hen Canaries, though accu&s;tomed to the commerce of their own &s;pecies,
li&s;ten to the invitation of the male Goldfinches, and &s;ubmit without
reluctance to their embraces. The union is even as pro|ductive as with their
proper mates, &s;ince they have three hatches a-year with the Goldfinch. The
ca&s;e is different in the intercour&s;e of the cock Linnet with the Canary,
there being com|monly but one hatch, and very &s;eldom two in the year.</P>
<P>The progeny of the Canaries with the Si&s;kins, with the
Goldfinches, &amp;c. are prolific, and can breed not only with both the
&s;pecies from which <PB N="17" REF="30"> they &s;prung, but likewi&s;e with
each other; and thus may perpetuate an endle&s;s variety<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sprengel has made many ob&s;ervations with regard to the
cro&s;s-breeds of the Canaries with other &s;pecies, and particularly with the
Goldfinches; he has &s;hewn that the progeny continued to propagate with each
other, and with the parent races. The proof which he has adduced is complete,
though before him the&s;e hybrids were con&s;idered as &s;terile. 
<BIBL><HI>Amu&s;emens Innocens.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. We mu&s;t
own, however, that the fruits of the inter|mixture in the&s;e hybrids are far
from being &s;o certain or &s;o numerous as in the pure &s;pecies; they
generally have only one hatch a-year, &s;el|dom two, their eggs are often
addle, and the &s;ucce&s;s depends on many minute circum&s;tances, which it
would be impo&s;&s;ible to ob&s;erve, and &s;till le&s;s to de&s;cribe with
preci&s;ion. It is &s;aid, that in the&s;e there are always more males than
females. 
<Q REND="inline">"A hen Canary (&s;ays Father Bougot) and a
Goldfinch have, in the &s;ame year at three different times, laid me nineteen
eggs, which all hatched, and of the young were only three females."</Q> It
would be proper to a&s;certain this fact by repeated ob&s;ervations. In the
pure breeds of &s;everal birds, as in the partridges, it has al&s;o been
remarked that the males exceed the females. The &s;ame remark applies to the
human race: in our climates, &s;eventeen boys are born for &s;ix|teen girls. We
know not the preci&s;e propor|tion between the male and female partridges, but
that the former are more numerous than the latter we are certain, becau&s;e in
the pairing <PB N="18" REF="31"> &s;ea&s;on, there are always cock birds that
want mates. It is likely, however, that &s;ixteen to three, as in the
cro&s;s-breed of the Canary and Gold|finch, is a greater inequality than ever
takes place in a pure breed. I have been told, that the &s;he|mules, got
between the a&s;s and the mare, exceed in number the he-mules; but I could
never ob|tain accurate information on that &s;ubject. Our bu&s;ine&s;s then is
to determine by ob&s;ervation the number of males and of females in the pure
race of the Canary, and afterwards to examine if that of the males be &s;till
greater in the cro&s;s|breed of the Goldfinch and hen Canary. What di&s;po&s;es
me to entertain this opinion is, that the character of the male is in general
more deeply impre&s;&s;ed on the progeny, than that of the fe|male. The&s;e
hybrids, which are &s;tronger than the Canaries, and have a louder voice, are
al&s;o longer lived. But there is an ob&s;ervation which applies alike to all,
that the period of their lives is abridged by their ardour in propagation. A
cock Canary rai&s;ed by it&s;elf, and without inter|cour&s;e with the female,
lives generally thirteen or fourteen years; and the cro&s;s-breed of the
Gold|finch will reach its eighteenth or nineteenth year. The cro&s;s-breed of
the Si&s;kin, if kept apart from the females, live fifteen or &s;ixteen years.
Whereas the cock Canary, which has one or &s;everal females, &s;eldom lives
longer than ten or eleven years; the cro&s;s-breed of the Si&s;kin eleven 
<PB N="19" REF="32"> or twelve, and that of the Goldfinch fourteen or fifteen.
It is al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary to part them from the females after the time of
hatching; that is, from the month of Augu&s;t to that of March; el&s;e the heat
of their pa&s;&s;ion would wa&s;te them, and abridge their lives by two or
three years.</P>
<P>To the&s;e remarks, which are all intere&s;ting, we may
&s;ubjoin a general and more important ob&s;ervation, which may throw &s;ome
light on the generation of animals, and the developement of their different
parts. It has been con&s;tantly noticed in the copulation of the Canaries, both
with tho&s;e of their own &s;pecies and with tho&s;e of other races, that the
offspring re&s;embled the father in the head, the tail, and the legs, and the
mother in the re&s;t of the body. The &s;ame has been ob&s;erved in quadrupeds.
The mule got between the jack-a&s;s and the mare, has the thick body of the
former, and the ears, the tail, and the thin legs of the latter. It appears
therefore that, in the mixture of the two &s;eminal liquors, how|ever intimate
we &s;uppo&s;e it to be, the organic molecules furni&s;hed by the female occupy
the centre of that living &s;phere which increa&s;es in all dimen&s;ions, and
that the molecules injected by the male &s;urround and inclo&s;e the&s;e; &s;o
that the extremities of the body proceed more im|diately from the father than
from the mother. The &s;kin, the hair, the colours, which may be con&s;idered
as the exterior of the body, retain mo&s;t of the paternal impre&s;&s;ions. In
the cro&s;s|breed <PB N="20" REF="33"> which I obtained from the copulation of
the he-goat with the ewe, they all had, in&s;tead of a &s;oft fleece, the
&s;haggy coat of the male. In the human &s;pecies, we may generally perceive,
that the &s;on re&s;embles the father more than the mother, in his legs, his
feet, and his hands; in his writing, in the quantity and colour o&s; his hair,
in his complexion, and in the bulk of his head: and the mulattoes born of a
negre&s;s lo&s;e more of the dark tinge than tho&s;e of a white woman. All
the&s;e facts &s;eem to confirm our general idea, that the female molecules
occupy the centre of the <HI>foetus,</HI> and, though brought into the
clo&s;e&s;t union, are more abundant near the &s;urface.</P>
<P>In general, the beauty of the &s;pecies can never be improved or
even pre&s;erved, without cro&s;&s;ing the breed: and the elegance of form, the
&s;trength and vigour of the body, depend almo&s;t &s;olely on the proportion
of the limbs. Accordingly, it is the males alone, which in man and in the
animals ennoble the race. Large, generous mares, covered by &s;orry little
hor&s;es, have always ill|made colts; but a fine &s;tallion will get a
beauti|tiful progeny from even the uglie&s;t mares, and the more di&s;&s;imilar
are the kinds of the parents, the hand&s;omer will be the offspring. The &s;ame
may be &s;aid of &s;heep: the breed is always improv|ed by &s;trange rams,
while the ordinary &s;mall &s;ort can never get good lambs from the mo&s;t
excel|lent ewes. I could enlarge upon this important <PB N="21" REF="34">
&s;ubject, but I &s;hould make too long a digre&s;&s;ion. Yet, to detail all
the facts re&s;pecting the inter|mixture of animals, would be the mo&s;t real
&s;ervice that can be rendered to Natural Hi&s;tory. As many people employ or
amu&s;e them&s;elves in breeding Canaries, which requires little time, numerous
experiments might be made by cro&s;s|ing them, and continuing to mix the fruits
of the embrace. I am confident that, by combin|ing the&s;e ob&s;ervations with
tho&s;e upon the qua|drupeds and upon man, we might be able to e&s;timate the
preci&s;e influence of the male in ge|neration, compared with that of the
female; and con&s;equently, from the general relations, to pro|nounce whether
&s;uch a male would &s;uit &s;uch a female, &amp;c.</P>
<P>But in the quadrupeds, as well as in man and in the &s;mall
birds, the difference of the moral qualities often di&s;turbs the
corre&s;pondence of the phy&s;ical properties. If any thing could prove that
the character of the individual is an original impre&s;&s;ion of nature which
education can never alter, it is an in&s;tance in the Canaries. 
<Q REND="inline">"They almo&s;t always" &s;ays Hervieux, "differ
from each other in their tempers; &s;ome males are always &s;ad, and, as it
were, ab&s;orbed in re|veries, generally bloated, and &s;ing but &s;el|dom, in
a mournful tone . . . . require an immen&s;e time to learn, are imperfectly
ac|quainted with what they are taught, and ea&s;ily forget it. . . . The&s;e
Canaries are often &s;o &s;lo|venly, <PB N="22" REF="35"> that their feet and
tail are always dirty; they never gain the affection of their females, which
they &s;oothe not with their &s;ong, while engaged in hatching; and the young
are little better than their fathers. . . . There are other Canaries which are
&s;o wicked, that they kill the female; the only way to &s;ucceed is, to give
them two females, which will unite in their common defence; and after
&s;ubduing their mate by force, they will retain the do|minion by love<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<Q REND="inline">"Sometimes the pravity of their
di&s;po&s;ition is in a certain mea&s;ure compen&s;ated by other qualities;
&s;uch, for in&s;tance, as their melodious &s;ong, their beautiful plumage, and
their familiar turn. If you would wi&s;h to make them breed, you mu&s;t give
them two &s;trong females one year older than them&s;elves; and the fe|males
&s;hould be accu&s;tomed for &s;everal months previous to live in the &s;ame
cage, that they may have no jealou&s;y to each other. And a month before the
love-&s;ea&s;on, they mu&s;t be both &s;et together in the breeding cage, and
at the proper time the male &s;hould be let in among them. He will be very
quarrel&s;ome the fir&s;t three days, but the females, uniting again&s;t him,
will certainly in the end gain the a&s;cendant, and he will be obliged to
&s;ubmit, and at la&s;t become attached to them. The&s;e kind of forced
marriages often &s;ucceed better than others from which more might be expected.
To pre&s;erve the hatch, the fir&s;t egg &s;hould be removed, and an ivory one
put in its place; the &s;ame mu&s;t be done the following days, always taking
them away as fa&s;t as they are laid, le&s;t the male &s;hould break them; and
after the la&s;t egg is dropped, the male mu&s;t be &s;hut in a &s;eparate
cage, and the female permitted to hatch undi&s;turbed. After the young are
ready to be taken from the mother, the pri&s;oner may be returned to his
female." 
<BIBL><HI>Trait&eacute; des Serins des
Canaries.</HI></BIBL></Q></NOTE>. Others are of a di&s;po&s;i|tion &s;o
barbarous, that they break the eggs and eat them; or if the&s;e have e&s;caped
their ferocity, they lay hold of the callow brood by <PB N="23" REF="36"> the
bill, drag them into the cage and murder them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<Q REND="inline">"There are males of a weak habit,
indifferent about the females, and always &s;ick after ne&s;tling; the&s;e
mu&s;t not be paired, for I ob&s;erve that the offspring re&s;emble the father.
There are others &s;o libidinous, that they drive the female from her ne&s;t,
and would not allow her to &s;it; the&s;e are of a hardy con&s;titution, have a
&s;uperior &s;ong, a finer plumage, and are tamer. Others break the eggs, and
kill the young, the more to enjoy the female. Others &s;hew a predilection for
an individual, and will, out of twenty, &s;elect their favourite, to which they
will pay particular attention. Tho&s;e have a good temper, and will communicate
it to their progeny. Others di&s;cover fondne&s;s for no female, and remain
inactive and unproductive. The &s;ame difference of character and tempera|ment
are to be found in the females. The jonquil females are mo&s;t gentle; the
agate &s;ort are capricious, and often de&s;ert their young to join the male;
the variegated females are a&s;&s;iduous on their eggs and affectionate to
their young, but the variegated males are the mo&s;t ardent of all the
Canaries, and mu&s;t have two or three females, el&s;e they will drive them
from the ne&s;t and break the eggs. Tho&s;e which are entirely jonquil have
nearly the &s;ame fire of tem|per, and require two or three females. The agate
males are the feeble&s;t, and the females of that kind often expire upon their
eggs." 
<BIBL><HI>Note communicated by Father</HI>
BOUGOT.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>."</Q> Some are &s;o wild and independent, that they
will not &s;uffer them&s;elves to be touched or care&s;&s;ed, and can neither
be governed nor treat|ed like the re&s;t: they &s;purn at the lea&s;t
interfer|ence, and it is only when left to the impul&s;e of their humours that
they will couple and breed. Others are exce&s;&s;ively indolent; the gray for
in&s;tance &s;carcely ever take the pains to build a ne&s;t, but it mu&s;t be
provided for them, &amp;c. All the&s;e characters are, we &s;ee, very different
from each other, and from tho&s;e of our favourite Canaries, which are ever
joyous, and ever chanting; are <PB N="24" REF="37"> &s;o tame and &s;o lovely;
are excellent hu&s;bands, and affectionate fathers; are of &s;o mild a tem|per,
and of &s;o happy a di&s;po&s;ition, that they re|ceive every generous
impre&s;&s;ion, and glow with each exalted feeling. They continually amu&s;e
the female by their &s;ong, they &s;ooth the languor of her occupation, they
entreat her to take re|lief in hatching, and, in her place, they &s;it
&s;e|veral hours every day; they al&s;o feed the young; and la&s;tly, receive
whatever in&s;tructions are given. From the&s;e alone we are to judge of the
&s;pecies, and I mention the others only, to &s;hew that, even in animals, the
temper is de|rived from nature, and not formed by edu|cation.</P>
<P>Moreover, the apparently wicked di&s;po&s;ition, which drives
them to break their eggs and kill their young, proceeds often from the fire of
their amorous pa&s;&s;ions. To enjoy the female oftener, and riot in the
fulne&s;s of plea&s;ure, they plunder the ne&s;t, and de&s;troy the deare&s;t
objects of their affection. The be&s;t way to breed from the&s;e birds, is to
&s;eparate them, and put them in the cage; it will be much better to give them
a chamber having a &s;unny a&s;pect, and facing the ea&s;t in winter. For in
the cage they will break the eggs to repeat their embrace; but when they are
lodged in an apartment where there are more females than males, they will pay
their addre&s;&s;es to another, and allow the fir&s;t to hatch undi&s;|turbed.
Be&s;ides, the males, from jealou&s;y, will <PB N="25" REF="38"> not &s;uffer
di&s;orders to be committed; and when one is prompted by ardor to tea&s;e his
female and break her eggs, they give him a &s;ound beating, &s;ufficient to
mortify his concupi&s;cence.</P>
<P>The materials given to build their ne&s;t, are the &s;crapings
of fine linen rags, cows and &s;tags hair, u&s;ele&s;s for other purpo&s;es,
mo&s;s, and &s;lender dry &s;talks of hay. The Goldfinches and Si&s;kins, when
lodged with the hen Canaries, to obtain a cro&s;s-breed, make u&s;e of the
mo&s;s and hay, but the Canaries prefer the hair and lint; but the&s;e mu&s;t
be well divided, le&s;t the fibres, &s;ticking to their feet, &s;hould
occa&s;ion the eggs to be broken.</P>
<P>To feed them, a crib is placed in the chamber, which is pierced
all round with holes that admit the head; and into it a portion of this mixture
is put; three pints of rape-&s;eed, two of oats, two of millet, and la&s;tly, a
pint of hemp &s;eed, and the crib is repleni&s;hed every twelve or thirteen
days, taking care that the grains be well cleaned and winnowed. This food is
proper when they are only &s;itting; but the day before the young are excluded
from the &s;hell, the parents ought to have a dry cake baked without &s;alt,
and after eating it, they &s;hould have hard boiled eggs; one being
&s;ufficient for two males and four fe|males, and two for four males and eight
females, and &s;o on in proportion. They ought to have no &s;allad or greens
while rearing the offspring, for this would weaken much the young. But to vary
&s;omewhat their diet, they &s;hould every <PB N="26" REF="39"> three days be
pre&s;ented on a plate with a bit of white bread &s;oaked in water, and
&s;queezed in the hand; this being not &s;o rich as the cake, and preventing
them from growing too fat while breeding. It would al&s;o be proper to give
them a few Canary &s;eeds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Alpis</HI> in French, the
Canary-gra&s;s being termed <HI>Alpi&s;te.</HI> It is the <HI>Phalaris
Canarien&s;is</HI> of Linuaeus. It is a native of the Canary i&s;lands, whence
it &s;prings &s;pontaneou&s;ly in the corn fields; but is now cultivated in
&s;mall qu ntities in many parts of Europe.</NOTE>, but only once in two days,
le&s;t they be heated too much. Sugar bi&s;cuit commonly produces that effect,
and is attended with another &s;till wor&s;e, that the hens fed on it lay eggs
that are addle, or too &s;mall and tender. When the eggs are &s;mall, the
rape|&s;eed &s;hould be boiled every day to blunt its acri|mony. 
<Q REND="inline">"Long experience," &s;ays Father Bou|got, "has
informed us, that this &s;ort of food agrees be&s;t, whatever the authors, who
have written on Canaries, may a&s;&s;ert."</Q></P>
<P>After the hatch, the Canaries ought to be purged with plantain
and lettuce-&s;eeds; but care mu&s;t be taken to remove the young birds, which
would be greatly weakened by this regimen, and the parents mu&s;t not be
confined to it longer than two days. When you want to feed them with the
&s;tick, you ought not, as mo&s;t bird-catchers advi&s;e, leave them with the
mother till the eleventh or twelfth day; you ought to remove them with their
ne&s;t as early as the eighth day. The food for the young <PB N="27" REF="40">
Canaries ought to be prepared before hand; it is a pa&s;te compo&s;ed of boiled
rape-&s;eed, yolks of eggs and crumbs of cake mixed together, and beaten up
with a little water. It ought to be given to them every two hours, and rammed
into their bill. It mu&s;t not be too liquid, le&s;t it turn &s;our, and it
mu&s;t be made fre&s;h every day till the young can eat without
a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>The produce of the&s;e captive birds is not &s;o regular, but
appears to be more numerous than it probably would be in the &s;tate of
liberty. Some females have four or five hatches annually, and lay four, five,
&s;ix, or even &s;even eggs each time; and generally they have three hatches,
and the moulting hinders them from another<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<Q REND="inline">"There are females which never lay at all, and
are called <HI>brehaignes</HI> (barren); others lay only once or twice in the
whole year, and even repo&s;e two or three days between the fir&s;t and
&s;econd egg. Others have only three hatches, which are regular,
con|&s;i&s;ting of three eggs laid without interruption. A fourth &s;ort,
called the <HI>common,</HI> becau&s;e the mo&s;t numerous, may have four
hatches of four or five eggs, but not always uniform. Others are &s;till better
layers, having five hatches, and &s;till more if allowed; and in each of
the&s;e are &s;ix or &s;even eggs. When this kind feed well, they are
excellent, and we cannot be too careful of them, for they are worth half a
dozen of the ordinary Canaries." 
<BIBL><HI>Trait&eacute; des Serins des
Canaries.</HI></BIBL></Q></NOTE>. Some however &s;it even during moulting, if
they happen to be laying before that &s;ea&s;on. The birds of the &s;ame hatch
do not all moult at the &s;ame time. The weake&s;t fir&s;t drop their feathers,
and the &s;tronge&s;t more than a month afterwards. In Jonquil Canaries this
change <PB N="28" REF="41"> of plumage is tedious, and commonly more dangerous
than in the other kinds. The female Jonquils have only three hatches, each of
three eggs; the flaxen coloured Canaries are too deli|cate, and their brood
&s;eldom thrives. The Pink &s;hew a reluctance to pair with each other; in a
large volery, the male but rarely couples with the female of his own colour,
and to form the union, they mu&s;t be confined together in a cage. The white
&s;ort are commonly valuable in every re&s;pect; they lay and breed as well, or
rather better than the others, and the variegated white are the hardie&s;t of
all.</P>
<P>Whatever differences there may be in the di&s;|po&s;itions and
prolific powers of the&s;e birds, the period of incubation is the &s;ame; all
of them &s;it thirteen days; and when the exclu&s;ion of the young is a day
earlier or later, it is owing to &s;ome particular circum&s;tance. Cold retards
the proce&s;s, and heat forwards it; accordingly the fir&s;t hatch, which is in
April, requires thirteen days and a half, or even fourteen days, if the weather
is chilly; but the third, which happens during the heats of July and Augu&s;t,
is effected in twelve days and a half, or even twelve days. It would be proper
to &s;eparate all the good eggs from the bad; and, to do this with certainty,
we ought to wait to the eighth or ninth day, and take each gently by the two
ends for fear of break|ing it, and examine it in a &s;trong light, or by a
candle, and reject all that are addle, which if left <PB N="29" REF="42"> would
only fatigue the hen. By this trial we may often reduce three hatches to two;
and in that ca&s;e the third female may be liberated, and permitted to begin a
&s;econd ne&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> When the eggs of one female are &s;et
under another, they mu&s;t be all &s;ound. If addle or tainted eggs be given
the variegated fe|males, they will throw them out of the ne&s;t; and if the
ne&s;t is too deep to admit their being tumbled out, they peck them till
broken, which often &s;poils the ne&s;t, and fru&s;trates the whole hatch.
Fe|males of other colours cover wind eggs when placed under them. 
<BIBL><HI>Note communicated by Father</HI>
BOUGOT.</BIBL></NOTE>. A plan &s;trongly recommended by bird-fanciers is to
re|move the eggs as they are dropt, and to &s;ub&s;ti|tute in their &s;tead
eggs of ivory; &s;o that after the laying is over, the real eggs are
re&s;tored, and all hatch at the &s;ame time. Commonly the egg is dropt at
&s;ix or &s;even o'clock in the morn|ing, and it is &s;aid that if it be a
&s;ingle hour later the bird is &s;ick; and, as the laying proceeds thus
regularly, it is ea&s;y to remove the eggs as fa&s;t as they are excluded<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The laying is always at the &s;ame hour, if the
female is healthy; however, the la&s;t egg mu&s;t be excepted, which is
commonly &s;eve|ral hours later, and often a day. This la&s;t egg is always
&s;maller than the re&s;t; and I am told that it always gives a cock-bird. It
would be curious to a&s;certain this &s;ingular fact.</NOTE>. But this
precaution is more &s;uited to the convenience of man than con&s;onant to the
train of Nature. When five of &s;ix young are hatched at once, they exhau&s;t
the vigour of the mother, and rather damp her &s;pirits; but if they appear
&s;ucce&s;&s;ively, they repeatedly renew her plea&s;ure, and in&s;pire new
courage to di&s;|charge her duty. Intelligent per&s;ons who have 
<PB N="30" REF="43"> had experience in breeding the&s;e birds a&s;&s;ure me,
that they always &s;ucceed be&s;t when they do not employ this artificial
expedient.</P>
<P>We may a&s;&s;ert that, in general, all the nice precautions,
and the refined manoeuvres recom|mended by writers for training the Canaries,
are pernicious rather than u&s;eful; and that in every re&s;pect we ought as
much as po&s;&s;ible to copy Nature. In their native country they haunt the
&s;ides of &s;mall rivulets, or wet gullies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Canary
Finches imported into England are bred in the <HI>barancos,</HI> or gullies
formed by the torrents from the mountains. 
<BIBL><HI>Hi&s;t. Gen. des Voyages.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>; we
ought therefore to give them plenty of water, both for drinking and bathing. As
they belong to an exceedingly mild climate, they mu&s;t be &s;heltered from the
rigours of winter. It appears indeed that being long naturalized in France,
they can bear the cold of that country; for they may be kept in a chamber
without a fire, and even without a gla&s;s-window, a wire-grate to prevent
their e&s;cape being &s;ufficient; &s;everal dealers in birds have informed me
that they lo&s;t fewer in this way than when the rooms were heated by a fire.
The &s;ame may be &s;aid of their food, which is probably the more &s;uited to
them the &s;impler it is<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"> 
<P>I have often ob&s;erved from my own experience, and from
that of others who adhered &s;crupulou&s;ly to all the minute directions given
by authors, that extreme care and attention often killed their birds. A regular
diet of rape-&s;eed and millet, water every day in winter, and once or twice
a-day in &s;ummer; ground&s;el, when it is to be had, in the month of May;
chickweed in the time of moulting, and in&s;tead of &s;ugar, brui&s;ed oats and
Turkey wheat, and above all great cleanline&s;s, areall that I would recommend.
<HI>Small Tract on the Breeding of Canaries, communicated by M. Batteau,
Advocate at Dijoz.</HI></P> 
<P>N. B. I mu&s;t here correct a &s;mall error. All the
bird-catchers whom I have con&s;ulted tell me, that we ought to avoid giving
them chickweed in the time of moulting, for it is too cooling, and would
protract their &s;tate of indi&s;po&s;ition. The other directions of Bat|reau
&s;eem to me well founded.</P></NOTE>. A circum&s;tance that requires 
<PB N="31" REF="44"> the mo&s;t attention is not to ha&s;ten their fir&s;t
hatch; it is common to allow them to couple about the twentieth or twenty-fifth
of March, but it would be better to wait till the twelfth or fifteenth of
April; for if the &s;ea&s;on be cold, they are apt to contract a di&s;gu&s;t to
each other; and if the females happen to have eggs, they aban|don them, at
lea&s;t till the weather grows warm: and thus a whole hatch is lo&s;t in
attempting to accelerate the breeding.</P>
<P>The young Canaries differ from the old ones, both in the colour
of their plumage, and in &s;ome other circum&s;tances. 
<Q REND="inline">"A young Canary of the &s;ame year (ob&s;erved

colour, change; the old ones can be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the young by their
&s;trength, their plumage, and their &s;ong; the tints are deeper, and more
lively; their toes are rougher, and incline more on black, if they are of the
gray kind; their nails are al&s;o thicker, and longer than tho&s;e of the young
ones<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Amu&s;emens Innocens, p. 61 &amp;
62.</BIBL></NOTE>. The female is often &s;o like the male that they cannot at
fir&s;t be di&s;tingui&s;hed; however, the colours are always deeper in the
male, the head rather thicker and longer, and the temples of a yellow, more
inclined to orange; and under the bill there is a &s;ort of yellow flame which
de&s;cends lower than in the female; its legs are al&s;o &s;tronger; and
la&s;tly, it begins to warble almo&s;t as &s;oon as it is able to feed by
it&s;elf. It is true that &s;ome females chant at that tender age with almo&s;t
as much &s;pirit as the males: but, joining all the&s;e marks together, we may
be able even before the fir&s;t month to decide which are males or females;
after that time there is no more uncertainty in that re&s;pect, for the &s;ong
of the males then begins to betray their &s;ex.</P>
<P>Every &s;udden utterance of &s;ound is in ani|mals an obvious
&s;ign of pa&s;&s;ion; and as love is of all the inward feelings that which the
oftene&s;t, <PB N="33" REF="46"> and the mo&s;t forcibly agitates the frame,
the ar|dor is con&s;tantly marked by the expre&s;&s;ion of the voice. The birds
by their &s;ong, the bull by his lowing, the hor&s;e by his neighing, the bear
by his loud murmur, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all announce the work|ing of the &s;ame
de&s;ire. The appetite is much calmer in the female than in the male, and
ac|cordingly it is but &s;eldom expre&s;&s;ed by the voice. The chant of the
hen Canary is only a feeble tone of tender &s;atisfaction, a coy a&s;&s;ent to
the warm applications of her mate, and in&s;pired by the eloquence of his
warble; but when this pa&s;|&s;ion is once excited in her veins, it becomes
ne|ce&s;&s;ary to her exi&s;tence; and if &s;he be parted from her lover, &s;he
&s;ickens and dies.</P>
<P>It &s;eldom happens that the Canaries bred in a chamber are
indi&s;po&s;ed before laying; &s;ome males only exhau&s;t their vigour, and
fall victims to the ardor of pa&s;&s;ion. If the female becomes &s;ick while
hatching, her eggs mu&s;t be taken from her, and given to another; for though
&s;he recovers &s;oon, &s;he would not &s;it on them again. The fir&s;t
&s;ymptom of bad health, e&s;pe|cially in the males, is &s;adne&s;s; as &s;oon
as they lo&s;e their natural cheerfulne&s;s, they ought to be put alone in a
cage, and &s;et in the &s;un in the chamber where the female is lodged. If he
be|comes bloated, we mu&s;t notice if there be a pimple below his tail; when
this pimple is ripe and white, the bird it&s;elf often pierces it with the
bill; but if the &s;uppuration advances too <PB N="34" REF="47"> &s;lowly, we
may di&s;charge it with a large needle, and then fill the wound with &s;pittle
without &s;alt, which would be too &s;marting. Next day the patient &s;hould be
let loo&s;e in the chamber, and it will be ea&s;y to perceive by his treatment
of the female, and the fondne&s;s that he &s;hews, whether he is cured or not.
In this la&s;t ca&s;e, we mu&s;t take him again, and blow through a &s;mall
quill &s;ome white wine under his wings, place him in the &s;un, and notice
next day the &s;tate of his health. If he &s;till continue deject|ed, and
indifferent to his female, his recovery is now almo&s;t de&s;perate; we mu&s;t
remove him into a &s;eparate cage, and give the hen another male like the one
&s;he has lo&s;t; or if &s;uch can|not be had, we mu&s;t &s;eek one of the
&s;ame &s;pecies at lea&s;t. A greater fondne&s;s commonly &s;ub&s;i&s;ts
between tho&s;e that re&s;emble each other, except in the ca&s;e of the Pink
Canaries, which prefer the females of a different colour; but this new male
mu&s;t not be a novice in love, and con&s;e|quently mu&s;t have already
rai&s;ed a hatch. If the female falls &s;ick, the &s;ame treatment may be
u&s;ed.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t common cau&s;e of di&s;tempers is the too great
plenty, or richne&s;s of food. When the&s;e birds make their ne&s;ts in a cage,
they often eat to exce&s;s, or &s;elect the nutritious aliments intended for
their young; and mo&s;t of them &s;icken from repletion, or inflammation. If
they be kept in a chamber, this danger is in a great <PB N="35" REF="48">
mea&s;ure removed, their numbers preventing their gluttony. A male which &s;its
too long, is &s;ure of being beat by the other males; and the &s;ame is the
ca&s;e with the females. The&s;e quarrels give them exerci&s;e, and
nece&s;&s;arily produce tempe|rance; and for this rea&s;on chiefly it is that
they &s;eldom are ever &s;ick in a chamber during the time of breeding: their
infirmities and di&s;ea&s;es appear only after they have hatched; mo&s;t of
them have fir&s;t the pimple which I have men|tioned, and then they all undergo
the moulting. Some &s;upport well this metamorpho&s;is, and &s;till &s;ing a
part of the day; but mo&s;t of them lo&s;e their voice, and a few langui&s;h
and die. After the females are &s;ix or &s;even years old, many of them die in
changing their plumage; the males recover better from the attendant
&s;ickne&s;s, and &s;urvive their mates three or four years. Indeed we mu&s;t
con&s;ider moulting as the regular pro|ce&s;s of Nature, rather than as an
accidental di&s;|temper; and if the&s;e birds were not reduced by us to
captivity, and rendered delicate by our treatment, they would &s;uffer only a
&s;light indi&s;|po&s;ition, and would &s;pontaneou&s;ly di&s;cover the proper
remedies: but at pre&s;ent it is a grievous &s;ickne&s;s, often fatal, and
which be&s;ides admits of few remedies; it is however the le&s;s dangerous the
earlier it happens<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<P> In the time of moulting, a bit of &s;teel, and not of iron,
&s;hould be put in their water, and changed thrice a-week. No other re|medies
are needed, though Hervieux reckons &s;everal; only during this critical
period, a rather larger portion of hemp-&s;eed &s;hould be mixed with their
u&s;ual food. 
<BIBL><HI>Note communicated by Father</HI> BOUGOT.</BIBL></P>

<P>Ob&s;erve that &s;teel is recommended in&s;tead of iron,
only le&s;t the iron &s;hould be ru&s;ty, in which ca&s;e it would be more
pernicious than u&s;e&s;ul.</P></NOTE>. The young Canaries <PB N="36" REF="49">
drop their feathers the fir&s;t year &s;ix weeks after they are hatched; they
become low-&s;pirited, appear bloated, and conceal the head in their plumage;
at this time the down only falls; but the following year they lo&s;e the
quills, even tho&s;e of the wings, and of the tail. The young birds of the
later hatches which happen in Sep|tember or after, &s;uffer much more from the
moulting, than tho&s;e which are excluded in the &s;pring; in that delicate
condition the cold is extremely pernicious, and they would all peri&s;h if not
kept where it is temperate, or even pretty warm. As long as the moulting
la&s;ts, that is &s;ix weeks or two months, Nature labours at the production of
new feathers; and the organic molecules, which were before directed to the
&s;upply of the &s;eminal liquor, are now ab&s;orbed in this growth; and hence
the exuberance of life being diverted into different channels, their ardor
cea&s;es, and the bu&s;ine&s;s of propagation is for the time
&s;u&s;pended.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t fatal and the mo&s;t common di&s;tem|per,
e&s;pecially in young Canaries, is what is called the <HI>&s;wallow
(avalure),</HI> in which the bowels &s;eem to be <HI>&s;wallowed,</HI> and
drawn to the extremity of their body; the inte&s;tines are per|ceived 
<PB N="37" REF="50"> through the &s;kin of the belly in the &s;tate of
inflammation, redne&s;s, and di&s;ten&s;ion; the feathers on that part drop,
the bird pines, gives over eating, though always &s;itting be&s;ide the food,
and dies in a few days. The &s;ource of the di&s;ea&s;e is the exce&s;&s;ive
abundance or richne&s;s of the aliments. All remedies are vain; and the change
of regimen is the only thing which can recover a few out of a great number. The
bird is put into a &s;eparate cage, and given water and lettuce &s;eeds; thus
the heat that con&s;umes it is tempered, and evacuations are &s;ometimes
per|formed which &s;ave its life. This di&s;temper al&s;o is the fruit of their
artificial education, for it &s;el|dom attacks tho&s;e which are trained by
their pa|rents; we ought therefore to take the greate&s;t care not to overfeed
them with the &s;tick; boiled rape-&s;eed, and &s;ome chickweed, are proper,
but no &s;ugar or bi&s;cuit; and in general we &s;hould give them too little
rather than too much.</P>
<P>When the Canary utters a frequent feeble cry, which &s;eems to
come from the bottom of its brea&s;t, it is &s;aid to be a&s;thmatic; it is
al&s;o &s;ubject to a certain ob&s;truction of voice, e&s;pe|cially after
moulting. This &s;ort of a&s;thma is cured by giving it the &s;eeds of
plantain, and hard bi&s;cuit &s;oaked in white wine; and to re&s;tore its voice
it ought to have generous food, &s;uch as yolks of eggs beat up with crumbs of
bread; and for drink, liquorice-water, that is water in which that root has
been &s;teeped and boiled.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="51"> The Canaries are al&s;o &s;ubject to a
&s;ort of &s;hanker on the bill. This di&s;order is owing to the &s;ame cau&s;e
with the <HI>&s;wallow,</HI> the abundance or richne&s;s of food producing an
inflammation, which, in&s;tead of affecting the inte&s;tines, &s;ome|times
extends to the throat or palate; the &s;ame cooling remedies mu&s;t be applied;
they &s;hould be given lettuce-&s;eeds, and brui&s;ed melon-&s;eeds mixed with
their drink.</P>
<P>The mites and the &s;cab with which the&s;e &s;mall birds are
&s;ometimes affected are generally owing to the dirtine&s;s with which they are
kept. Care mu&s;t be taken to pre&s;erve them clean, to give them water to
bathe in, to avoid putting old or bad wood in their cages, and to cover them
only with new cloth that is not moth-eaten; and the &s;eeds and herbs with
which they are to be fed &s;hould be fanned and wa&s;hed. We mu&s;t pay this
attention, if we would wi&s;h them to be neat and healthy. In the &s;tate of
na|ture they would them&s;elves pre&s;erve cleanline&s;s; but impri&s;oned,
they are &s;ubject to the loath&s;ome di&s;orders incident to that &s;tate:
however, many of the&s;e birds, though reduced to the melan|choly condition of
captivity, are never &s;ick, and in the&s;e habit &s;eems to have become a
&s;econd nature. In general, the &s;ource of their di&s;ea&s;es is the heat of
their con&s;titution. They always need water; and if a plate with &s;now be
placed in the cage, or even in the volery, they will roll in it &s;everal times
with expre&s;&s;ions of plea&s;ure, <PB N="39" REF="52"> though in the
colde&s;t weather. This proves that it is rather pernicious than u&s;eful to
keep them in very hot places<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> The&s;e birds require not
to be kept in a warm place, as many pretend; in the mo&s;t inten&s;e colds they
welter in &s;now, when pre&s;ent|ed them on a plate. For my own part, I have
them in a chamber in winter with only an iron-grating, and the windows open;
they &s;ing admirably, and I never lo&s;e any. 
<BIBL><HI>Note communicated by Father</HI>

<P>But there is another di&s;temper to which the Canaries and many
other birds are &s;ubject<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Jays, the
Goldfinches, all the Parrots, and the large&s;t Aras.</NOTE>, e&s;|pecially in
the &s;tate of confinement: this is the epilep&s;y. The yellow Canaries in
particular are oftener than the others &s;eized with the falling &s;ickne&s;s,
which attacks them &s;uddenly, and even &s;urpri&s;es them in the mid&s;t of
their mo&s;t im|pa&s;&s;ioned warble. It is &s;aid that they mu&s;t not be
touched the moment they fall, but mu&s;t be watched till they di&s;charge a
drop of blood from the bill, and that they may be then lifted up, and will
recover them&s;elves, and in a &s;hort time re&s;ume their &s;en&s;es and their
life: that it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to wait till Nature makes that &s;alutary
effort which is announced by the expre&s;&s;ion of the drop of blood, and that
if handled prema|turely, the violence of agitation would bring on in&s;tant
death. It is to be wi&s;hed that this ob|&s;ervation were a&s;certained, &s;ome
circum&s;tances in which appear to me rather doubtful. Certain it is, that if
they e&s;cape the fir&s;t attack of this <PB N="40" REF="53"> epilep&s;y, they
live a long time after, and &s;ome|times attain the &s;ame age with tho&s;e
which have never been affected by that di&s;temper. How|ever, I am inclined to
think, that a &s;mall inci|&s;ion in the toes would be beneficial, for in that
way Parrots are cured of the epilep&s;y.</P>
<P>What mi&s;eries in the train of &s;lavery! Would the&s;e birds,
if they enjoyed their native free|dom, be a&s;thmatic, &s;cabby, and
epileptical? Would they be afflicted by inflammations, ab&s;ce&s;&s;es, and
&s;hankers? and the mo&s;t melancholy of di&s;orders, what is produced by the
craving of un&s;atisfied lu&s;t, is it not common to all beings reduced to
captivity? In particular, the females, who&s;e &s;eelings are &s;o nice and
&s;o tender, are more &s;ub|ject to it than the males. It has been ob&s;erved,
that after the hen Canary falls &s;ick in the &s;pring before pairing, &s;he
&s;hrinks, langui&s;hes, and dies. The amorous pa&s;&s;ion is awakened by the
&s;inging of the males around her, while &s;he has at the &s;ame time no
opportunity of gratification. The males, though they fir&s;t feel libidinous
de&s;ires, and always appear more ardent, &s;upport better the languor of
celibacy; they &s;eldom die of continence, but they are often killed by
ex|ce&s;&s;ive venery.</P>
<P>The hen Canaries can, like the females of other birds, lay eggs
without commerce with the male. The egg in it&s;elf is, as we have el&s;ewhere
ob|&s;erved, only a matrix which the bird excludes, and will remain unprolific,
if not impregnated <PB N="41" REF="54"> with the &s;eed of the male; and the
heat of in|cubation, in&s;tead of quickening it, only ha&s;tens its
putrefaction. It has al&s;o been remarked that if the females be entirely
&s;eparated from the males, &s;o as not to &s;ee and hear them, they very
&s;eldom lay; and that they oftene&s;t drop their eggs, when melted by the view
or the &s;ong of the males: &s;o much do even di&s;tant objects act upon
feeling animals, and &s;o many are the ways in which the &s;ubtile flame of
love is commu|nicated<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We &s;hall here mention two facts
to which we were witne&s;s. A female &s;ung &s;o well, that &s;he was taken for

her &s;ex; &s;he took to laying and renounced her &s;ong. The other fact is
that of a female, alive at pre&s;ent, that chants or rather whi&s;tles a tune,

<HEAD>FOREIGN BIRDS, THAT ARE RELATED TO THE CANARIES.</HEAD>
<P>THE foreign birds which may be referred to the Canary, are few
in number; we are acquainted with only three &s;pecies. The fir&s;t is that
which was &s;ent to us from the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of Africa, under the name of
<HI>the Mozambique Canary,</HI> which &s;eems to be a &s;hade between the
Canaries and the Si&s;kins. It is delineated <HI>Pl. Enl.</HI> N^o 364, Fig. 1.
and 2. Yellow is the prevailing colour of the lower part of the body, and brown
that of the upper, except the rump and the coverts of the tail, which are
yellow: the&s;e coverts, as well as tho&s;e of the wings and their quills, are
edged with white or whiti&s;h. The &s;ame yellow and brown occur on the head,
di&s;tributed in alternate bars; that which &s;tretches over the top of the
head is brown, next two yellow ones over the eyes, then two brown ones which
ri&s;e behind the eyes, after the&s;e two yel|low ones, and la&s;t of all two
brown ones, which extend from the corners of the bill. This bird is rather
&s;maller than tho&s;e from the Canary I&s;lands; its length from the tip of
the bill to the end of the tail is about four inches and a half, that of the
tail is only about an inch. The <PB N="44" REF="57"> female differs very little
from the male, either in &s;ize or in colour. This bird is perhaps the &s;ame
with that of Madaga&s;car, mentioned by Flaccourt under the name of
<HI>Mangoiche,</HI> which he &s;ays is a &s;pecies of Canary.</P>
<P>It is likely that this bird, which in its plumage re&s;embles
much our variegated Canaries, was their progenitor; and that the entire
&s;pecies be|longs only to the ancient continent, and to the Canary I&s;lands,
which may be con&s;idered as ad|jacent to the mainland: for the one mentioned
by Bri&s;&s;on under the name of <HI>the Jamaica Ca|nary,</HI> and of which
Sloane and Ray have given a &s;hort de&s;cription<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"Bird like the <HI>Serin,</HI> variegated
with cinereous, dilute, yellow, and du&s;ky colours."</Q> Its extreme length is
eight inches, its alar ex|tent is twelve inches, the bill &s;hort and &s;trong,
three-fourths of an inch long (or one-third according to Ray), the tail one
inch, the leg and foot one inch and one-fourth. (Bri&s;&s;on &s;u&s;pects that

Canaries, which are not found at all in America. Hi&s;torians and travellers
in|form us, that none were originally in Peru, and that the fir&s;t Canary was
introduced there in 1556, and that the &s;preading of the&s;e birds in 
<PB N="45" REF="58"> America, and e&s;pecially in the Antilles, was long
po&s;terior to that date. Father du Tertre relates that du Parquet, in 1657,
bought of a merchant who touched at the&s;e i&s;lands, a great number of real
Canaries, which he &s;et at liberty; &s;ince which time they were heard
warbling about his hou&s;e; &s;o that it is probable that they have multiplied
in that country. If true Canaries be found in Jamaica, they may have been
de|&s;cended from tho&s;e tran&s;ported to the Antilles, and naturalized there
in the year 1657. How|ever, the bird de&s;cribed by Sloane, Ray, and
Bri&s;&s;on, by the appellation of <HI>Jamaica Canary,</HI> appears to differ
too much from the natives of the Fortunate i&s;lands, to be &s;uppo&s;ed to
have origi|nated from tho&s;e tran&s;planted into the Antilles.</P>
<P>While this article was at the pre&s;s, we re|ceived &s;everal
Canaries from the Cape of Good Hope, among which I have perceived three males,
one female, and a young one of the &s;ame year. The&s;e males are very like the
Green Canary of Provence; they differ in being &s;omewhat larger, and their
bills being proportionally thick|er: their wings are al&s;o better variegated,
the quills of the tail edged with a di&s;tinct yellow, and they have no yellow
on the rump.</P>
<P>In the young Canary, the colours were &s;till fainter and le&s;s
marked than in the female.</P>
<P>But whatever &s;mall differences exi&s;t, I am &s;till the more
confirmed that the variegated <PB N="46" REF="59"> Canaries of the Cape of
Mozambique<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It appears that the Mozambique Canary is not
confined ex|clu&s;ively to that region. I have found among the drawings of
Commer&s;on a coloured figure of this bird very di&s;tinctly marked.
Commer&s;on calls it the Cape Canary, and informs us that it had been carried
to the I&s;le of France, where it was naturalized, and even greatly multiplied,
and was known there by the name of <HI>the Bird of the Cape.</HI> We may expect
to find in the &s;ame manner at Mo|zambique, and in &s;ome other countries of
Africa, the variegated Canaries of the Cape, perhaps even tho&s;e from the
Fortunate I&s;lands, and probably many other varieties of this
&s;pecies.</NOTE>, of Provence, and of Italy, are all derived from the &s;ame
common &s;ource, and that they belong to one &s;pecies, which is &s;pread, and
&s;ettled in all the climates of the ancient continent &s;uited to its
con&s;titution, from Provence and Italy to the Cape of Good Hope, and the
adjacent i&s;lands. Only this bird has a&s;&s;umed more of the green tint in
Provence, more of the gray in Italy, more of the brown or variegated colour at
the Cape of Good Hope, and &s;eems by the variety of its plumage to point at
the influence of a dif|ferent climate.</P>

<P>NATURE her&s;elf &s;eems to have a&s;&s;igned the&s;e birds a
place next after the Canaries; for their mutual commerce &s;ucceeds better than
the intercour&s;e of either with any other contiguous &s;pecies; and what
points out the clo&s;ene&s;s of this relation, the progeny is prolific<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This ob&s;ervation was communicated by Daubenton the
younger. Fri&s;ch a&s;&s;ures us, that pairing a Vine Linnet (Redpole) with a
white hen Canary, that was in the habit of coming abroad every day and
returning to its roo&s;t, it made its ne&s;t and laid its eggs in a
neighbouring bu&s;h, and when the young were hatched, it brought them to the
window of the hou&s;e. He adds, that this cro&s;s-breed had the whole plumage
of the mother, and the red &s;pots of the father, e&s;pecially on the
head.</NOTE>, e&s;pecially when a male Linnet is joined with a female
Canary.</P>
<P>Few birds are &s;o common as the Linnet, but &s;till fewer
perhaps unite &s;o many amiable quali|ties: a plea&s;ant warble, a rich
plumage, docility of di&s;po&s;ition, &s;u&s;ceptibility of attachment;
po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing whatever, in &s;hort, could invite the attention of man,
and contribute to his delight. Endowed with &s;uch talents, it could not long
pre&s;erve its freedom; and &s;till le&s;s, when nur&s;ed in the bo&s;om of
&s;lavery, could it retain un|&s;ullied <PB N="52" REF="66"> the beauties of
its original purity. In fact, the charming red colour with which Na|ture has
painted its head and brea&s;t, and which in the &s;tate of liberty &s;parkles
with durable lu&s;tre, wears off by degrees, and &s;oon di&s;ap|pears entirely
in our cages and voleries. There remain only a few ob&s;cure ve&s;tiges after
the fir&s;t moulting<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The red of the head changes into a
ru&s;ty-brown varied with blacki&s;h, and that of the brea&s;t pa&s;&s;es into
nearly the &s;ame colour; but the new &s;hades are not &s;o deep. An
<HI>amateur</HI> told me, that he has rai&s;ed &s;ome of the&s;e Linnets which
pre&s;erved the red: this fact &s;tands &s;ingle.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>With regard to the change effected in its &s;ong, we
&s;ub&s;titute for the free and varied modulations which &s;pring and love
in&s;pire, the &s;trained notes of a har&s;h mu&s;ic, which they repeat but
imper|fectly, and which has neither the beauties of art nor the charms of
nature. Some have al&s;o &s;ucceeded in teaching it to &s;peak different
lan|guages, that is to whi&s;tle &s;ome Italian, French, and Engli&s;h words,
&amp;c. and &s;ometimes even to pronounce the&s;e with con&s;iderable fluency.
Many per&s;ons have from curio&s;ity gone from London to Ken&s;ington merely to
hear an apo|thecary's Linnet, which articulated the words <HI>pretty boy.</HI>
The fact is, it had been taken out of the ne&s;t when only two or three days
old, before it had time to acquire the parent &s;ong; and ju&s;t beginning to
li&s;ten with attention, it was &s;truck with the &s;ound of <HI>pretty
boy,</HI> and learned it from <PB N="53" REF="67"> imitation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<P>A goldfinch which was taken from the ne&s;t two or three
days after hatching, and &s;et in a window that looked into a garden where the
wrens re&s;orted, caught their &s;ong, and had not a &s;ingle note of its own
&s;pecies.</P> 
<P>A &s;parrow was taken from the ne&s;t when it was fledged,
and educated under a Linnet; but hearing by accident a goldfinch, its &s;ong
was a mixture of that of the Linnet and the goldfinch.</P> 
<P>A robin was &s;et under a very fine nightingale, which began
to be out of &s;ong, and in a fortnight was perfectly mute; the robin had
three-parts in four of the nightingale's warble, the re&s;t being a confu&s;ed
jumble.</P> 
<P>La&s;tly, Mr. Barrington adds, that the Canaries imported
from Tyrol &s;eem to have been educated by parents the progenitor of which was
in&s;tructed by a nightingale; while the Canaries bred in England appear to
have derived their &s;ong from the tit-lark. 
<BIBL><HI>Philo&s;oph. Tran&s;act. Jan.</HI> 10,

<P>If we breed a young Linnet with a chaffinch, or nightingale,
&s;ays Ge&s;ner, it will acquire their &s;ong; and particularly that part of
the chaffinch's &s;ong that is called the <HI>alarum &s;ound.</HI> 
<BIBL>REITERZU, p. 591.</BIBL></P></NOTE>. This fact,
together with many others, appears to me to e&s;tabli&s;h the opinion of the
Honourable Daines Barrington, that birds have no innate &s;ong; and that the
warble peculiar to the different &s;pecies, and its varieties, have nearly the
&s;ame origin with the languages and the dialects of various nations<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The lo&s;s of the parent-cock at the critical time
for in&s;truction occa&s;ions undoubtedly the varieties in the &s;ong of each
&s;pecies; becau&s;e then the ne&s;tling has either attended to the &s;ong of
&s;ome other birds, or perhaps invented &s;ome notes of its own, which are
perpetuated from generation to generation, till &s;imilar accidents pro|duce
other alterations. The truth is, that &s;carcely any two birds of the &s;ame
&s;pecies have exactly the &s;ame notes, if they are accu|rately attended to,
though there is a general re&s;emblance. 
<BIBL>BAR|RINGTON, <HI>Philo&s;. Tran&s;.</HI>
1773.</BIBL></NOTE>. Mr. Barrington tells us, that in experiments of this kind
he pre|ferred a young cock Linnet of three weeks be|ginning <PB N="54" REF="68"> to fly, not only on account of its great facility and talent for
imitation, but be|cau&s;e in that &s;pecies it is ea&s;ier to di&s;tingui&s;h
the &s;ex; &s;ome of the outer-quills of the wings in the male having the
outer-edge white as far as the &s;haft, while in the female the&s;e are only
bor|dered with that colour.</P>
<P>It follows from the experiments of this learn|ed gentleman, that
the young Linnets educated by the different kinds of larks, and even by an
African Linnet, called <HI>Vengolina,</HI> of which we &s;hall afterwards
treat, acquired not the &s;ong of their parent, but that of their in&s;tructor.
Only a few retained the <HI>call</HI> of its &s;pecies, or the Lin|nets
<HI>chuckle,</HI> which they had heard of their pa|rents before they were
parted.</P>
<P>It is extremely doubtful whether our Com|mon Linnet, called by
&s;ome the <HI>Gray Linnet,</HI> is different from that termed the <HI>Vine
Linnet,</HI> or the <HI>Red Linnet:</HI> for, 1. The red &s;pots which
di&s;tingui&s;h the males in the Red Linnet are far from being con&s;tant,
&s;ince, as we have already ob&s;erved, they become obliterated in
confine|ment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<P>Of four cock Linnets, which were con&s;equently red, brought
to me on the twelfth of July, I expo&s;ed one to the open air, and &s;et three
in a chamber, two of which were &s;hut up in the &s;ame cage. The red on the
head of the latter began to di&s;appear by the twenty-eighth of Augu&s;t, and
al&s;o that on the lower part of the brea&s;t. On the eighth of September one
of the two was found dead; its head was entirely dive&s;ted of feathers, and
even &s;lightly wounded. I di&s;|covered that the one had fought the other
after the moulting, as if their acquaintance was di&s;&s;olved by the
di&s;gui&s;e of plumage. The red of the head of the vanqui&s;hed Linnet no
longer exi&s;ted, for all the feathers had dropped, and that of the brea&s;t
was more than half effaced.</P> 
<P>The third which was &s;hut up was very late in moulting, and
retained its red till that time. The one that was kept in the open air made its
e&s;cape at the end of three months; but it had already lo&s;t all its
red.&mdash;It follows from this experiment, that either the open air ha&s;tens
the di&s;appearance of the red, by advancing the moulting; or that the want of
fre&s;h air has a &s;maller &s;hare in the change of plumage in the&s;e birds
than the lo&s;s of liberty.</P></NOTE>. 2. They are not a di&s;criminating
cha|racter, <PB N="55" REF="69"> as traces of them are to be found in the bird
de&s;cribed to be the male of the Gray Lin|net, where the feathers on the
brea&s;t are of a dull red in their middle. 3. The moulting tar|ni&s;hes, and
for a time almo&s;t di&s;charges this red, which recovers not its lu&s;tre till
the fine wea|ther, but from the end of September colours the middle of the
feathers on the brea&s;t, as in that reckoned by Bri&s;&s;on a common cock
Linnet. 4. Ge&s;ner at Turin, Olina at Rome, Linnaeus at Stockholm<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No mention is made of the Gray Linnet in the <HI>Fauna
Suecica.</HI> Klein &s;peaks of one Zarn, author of a letter on the birds of
Ger|many, where he endeavours to prove that there is only one &s;pecies of
Linnet. I have heard the &s;ame a&s;&s;ertion of many bird-catchers, who had
never &s;een the letter; and Hebert, who is certainly a fit judge of the
matter, is of the &s;ame opinion.</NOTE>, and Belon in France, have known in
their re&s;pective countries only the Red Lin|nets. 5. Bird-catchers, who have
in France followed that profe&s;&s;ion more than thirty years, have never found
a &s;ingle cock Linnet which had not the red &s;hade corre&s;ponding to the
&s;ea|&s;on; and at the &s;ame time we &s;ee many Gray Linnets in the cage. 6.
Even tho&s;e who admit <PB N="56" REF="70"> the exi&s;tence of Gray Linnets in
the &s;tate of nature agree, that they are &s;carcely ever caught, particularly
in &s;ummer, which they attribute to their &s;hy di&s;po&s;ition. 7. Add to all
the&s;e, that the Red and Gray Linnets are very &s;imilar in the re&s;t of
their plumage, in their &s;ize, in the proportions and &s;hape of their parts,
in their &s;ong, and in their habits. And it will be ea&s;y to infer, that if
Gray Linnets really do exi&s;t, they are either, 1. all females; or, 2. all
young males of the year's hatch before October, for at that time they begin to
be marked; 3. &s;uch as being bred apart from the mothers cannot a&s;|&s;ume
red in the &s;tate of captivity; 4. tho&s;e which being caught lo&s;e their
tint in the cage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We mu&s;t ob&s;erve that tho&s;e birds
which have had the red &s;pots, but lo&s;t them, &s;till retain on the &s;ame

been marked with red.</NOTE>; or, la&s;tly, tho&s;e in which this beautiful
colour is effaced by moulting, di&s;ea&s;e, or &s;ome other cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The reader will not then be &s;urpri&s;ed that I refer the&s;e
two Linnets to the &s;ame identical &s;pecies; and con&s;ider the gray &s;ort
as only an accidental variety, partly effected by education, and afterwards
mi&s;taken by authors.</P>
<P>The Linnet often builds its ne&s;t in vineyards, and hence it
has been called the <HI>Vine-Linnet.</HI> Sometimes it places its ne&s;t on the
ground; at other times it fixes it between two props, or <PB N="57" REF="71">
even in the vine it&s;elf; it breeds al&s;o in ju|niper, goo&s;eberry, and
hazel-nut trees, in young cop&s;es, &amp;c. A great number of the&s;e ne&s;ts
have been brought to me in the month of May, a few in July, and only one in
September: they were all compo&s;ed of &s;lender roots, &s;mall leaves, and
mo&s;s on the out&s;ide, and lined with feathers, hairs, and a great deal of
wool. I never found more than &s;ix eggs; that of the fourth of Sep|tember had
only three; they were of a dirty white, &s;potted with brown red at the large
end. The Linnets have &s;eldom more than two hatches, except their eggs be
robbed, which obliges them to renew their labours; and in this way they may be
made to lay four times in the year. The mother feeds the young by di&s;gorging
into their bill what had been prepared and half-dige&s;ted in her craw.</P>
<P>After the hatching is over, and the family rai&s;ed, the Linnets
go in numerous flocks, which are formed about the end of Augu&s;t, when the
hemp is arrived at maturity; and at this time &s;ixty have been caught in one
drawing of the net<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The lark-net may be u&s;ed, but it
ought to be rather &s;maller and clo&s;er. One or two cock Linnets &s;hould be
had for calls. Chaffinches, and other &s;mall birds, are often caught with the
Lin|nets.</NOTE>, and out of the&s;e were forty males. They continue to live
thus in &s;ociety during the whole winter; they fly very crowded, alight and
ri&s;e together, perch on the &s;ame trees, and about the <PB N="58" REF="72">
beginning of &s;pring they all chant at once; they lodge during the night in
oaks, and elms, who&s;e leaves, though dry, have not yet fallen; they are
&s;een too on the linden-trees and pop|lars, and feed upon the buds; they live
al&s;o upon all kinds of &s;mall &s;eeds, particularly tho&s;e of thi&s;tles,
&amp;c. and hence they haunt indi&s;crimi|nately uncultivated lands, and
ploughed fields. Their walk is a &s;ort of hopping; but their flight is
continued and uniform, and not like that of the &s;parrow, compo&s;ed of a
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of jerks.</P>
<P>The &s;ong of the Linnet is announced by a &s;ort of prelude. In
Italy the Linnets of Abruzzo and of the Marche of Ancona are preferred. It is
generally &s;uppo&s;ed in France that the warble of the Red Linnet is
&s;uperior to that of the Gray. This is con&s;onant to rea&s;on; for a bird
which has formed its &s;ong in the bo&s;om of liberty, and from the impul&s;e
of its inward feelings, mu&s;t have more affecting and expre&s;&s;ive airs,
than one that has no object but only to cheer its languor, or to give the
nece&s;&s;ary exerci&s;e to its vocal or|gans.</P>
<P>The females are naturally de&s;titute of &s;ong, nor can they
ever acquire it. The adult males caught in the net profit as little by
in&s;truction; and the young males taken out of the ne&s;t are alone
&s;u&s;ceptible of education. They are fed with oatmeal-gruel, and rape-&s;eed
ground with milk or &s;ugared-water; and in the evening they are whi&s;tled to
in the weak light of a candle, <PB N="59" REF="73"> care being taken to
articulate di&s;tinctly the words which they are wanted to repeat. Some|times,
to begin them, they are held on the fin|ger before a mirror, in which they view
their image, and believe they &s;ee another bird of their own &s;pecies; they
&s;oon fancy that they hear the notes of a companion, and this illu&s;ion
produces a &s;ort of emulation which animates their &s;ongs, and quickens their
progre&s;s. It is &s;uppo&s;ed that they &s;ing more in a &s;mall cage than in
a large one.</P>
<P>The very name of the&s;e birds points out their proper food.
They are called Linnets <HI>(Linariae)</HI> becau&s;e they prefer lint-&s;eed;
to this are added the &s;eeds of panic, of rape, of hemp, of millet, of
Canary-gra&s;s, of raddi&s;h, of cabbage, of poppy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ge&s;ner &s;ays that if poppy-&s;eeds alone be given for food
either to Linnets or Goldfinches, they will become blind.</NOTE>, of plantain,

edged with white; and hence when the wings are clo&s;ed there is a white ray
parallel to the feathers. The female has commonly none of the red that we have

<HI>Vla&s;vinch;</HI> the Turki&s;h, <HI>Gezogen.</HI> Ari&s;totle termed it
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">. The character given by

<Q REND="inline">"It is of a du&s;ky che&s;nut, and beneath
tawny white; its wings are marked by a longitudinal white &s;tripe; its
tail-quills are black, edged with white."</Q> In the beginning of the &s;pring
the brea&s;t of the male is of a ro&s;e-crim|&s;on colour, which does not take
place in the female. It builds its ne&s;t with mo&s;s and bents, and lines it
with wool and hair; lays five eggs.</P> 
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Greater Red-headed Linnet,</HI> or
<HI>Red-Poll,</HI> which Buffon terms <HI>The Greater Vine-Linnet.</HI> It is
the <HI>Fringilla Cannabina</HI> of Linnaeus, or the <HI>Hemp-Finch;</HI> the
<HI>Linaria Rubra</HI> of Ge&s;ner, Ray, Bri&s;&s;on, &amp;c. The German name
is <HI>H&auml;nfling,</HI> or <HI>Hemp-bird;</HI> and the Italian <HI>Fanello
Marino,</HI> or <HI>Sea-Linnet.</HI> It is thus characterized by
Bri&s;&s;on:&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">"It is of a du&s;ky-che&s;nut, the margins
of its fea|thers more dilute, and beneath of a tawny-white; its wings marked
with a white longitudinal &s;tripe; its tail-quills black, the whole of their
borders white."</Q> The Linnaean character:&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">"The primary quills of its wings, and
tho&s;e of the tail, black, and white at both the edges."</Q> It is found both
in Europe and in America. It is &s;maller than the preceding, and is gregarious
in winter. The female has neither the red &s;pot on the crown, nor the
blu&s;h-coloured brea&s;t. It ne&s;tles on the ground. It is a very fa|miliar
bird, and quite cheerful a few minutes after it is caught.</P> 
<P>The opinion of our ingenious author with re&s;pect to the
identity of the &s;pecies of the Red Poll, and of the Common Linnet, is very
plau&s;ible; but it &s;eems not altogether well founded. The Red Poll is
&s;maller than the Linnet; it ne&s;tles on the ground, while the latter breeds
in furze and thorn-hedges. The egg of the Linnet is of a very faint blue,
dotted with ru&s;ty &s;pecks, and inter&s;per&s;ed with mi|nute brown
&s;treaks. The egg of the Red Poll is a very faint green, &s;prinkled with

body of a deep brown, the brea&s;t rufous, &s;peckled with brown, and the belly
white. It lays indeed three or four eggs only, according to Ge&s;ner, and its

<P>When we treat of birds who&s;e colours are &s;o variable as in
the pre&s;ent, we &s;hould fall into numberle&s;s mi&s;takes, if we
con&s;idered them as &s;pecific characters. We have already &s;een that 
<PB N="67" REF="81"> the common Linnet, in the &s;tate of liberty, was marked
with red on the head and brea&s;t; that the captive Linnet had the &s;ame
colour only on the brea&s;t, and that concealed; that the Stra&s;|burg Linnet
had it on the legs; and that the Mountain Linnet was painted with it on the
rump. Bri&s;&s;on &s;ays, that what he calls the Lit|tle Vine Linnet is red on
the head and brea&s;t; and Ge&s;ner adds, on the rump. Willughby mentions a
&s;mall Linnet which had a red &s;pot on the head, and in that circum&s;tance
re&s;embled the two de&s;cribed by Aldrovandus, though it differed in other
re&s;pects. La&s;tly, the <HI>Cabaret</HI> of Bri&s;&s;on was marked with red
on the head and rump, but that of Fri&s;ch had none on the head. It is obvious,
that a great part of the&s;e varieties is owing to the &s;ea&s;ons and the
circum&s;tances in which the&s;e birds have been &s;een. If in the middle of
&s;pring, they were clothed in their riche&s;t colours; if during the moulting
&s;ea&s;on, the red had di&s;appeared; if immediately after, it was not yet
re&s;umed. If they were kept in a cage, the change would be in proportion to
the length of their confinement; and as the feathers of the different parts of
the body would drop at different times, there would be abundant &s;ource of
diver&s;ity. In this un|certainty, we are obliged, in order to determine the
&s;pecies, to recur to the more permanent pro|perties; the &s;hape of the body,
the in&s;tincts, and habits. Applying this method, I can per|ceive 
<PB N="68" REF="82"> only two kinds of birds that have re|ceived the name of
Little Linnet: the one, which never &s;ings, appears but once in &s;ix or
&s;even years, arrives in numerous flocks, re&s;embles the Si&s;kin, &amp;c.:
it is the Little Vine Linnet of Bri&s;|&s;on: the other is the Twite of this
article.</P>
<P>The younger Daubenton had for two or three years one of
the&s;e birds, which was caught in a net. It was at fir&s;t very &s;hy, but it
became gradually reconciled, and grew quite familiar. It &s;eemed to prefer
hemp-&s;eed for its food. It had a &s;weet mellow note, much like that of the
Hedge Petty|chaps. It lo&s;t all its red the fir&s;t year, and never recovered
it; the other colours &s;uffered no altera|tion. When &s;ick or in moult, its
bill was ob|&s;erved to become immediately pale and yellowi&s;h; and as the
bird recovered, it pa&s;&s;ed through all the &s;hades to its proper brown
ca&s;t. The fe|male is not entirely de&s;titute of brilliancy of plu|mage; it
is marked with red on the head, but not on the rump. Though &s;maller than the
common hen Linnet, its voice is &s;tronger and more varied. This bird is rare
both in Germany and in France. It flies rapidly, but never in large flocks; its
bill is rather more &s;lender in proportion than that of the common Linnet.</P>
<P><HI>Mea&s;ures:</HI> the total length of the Twite is four
inches and a half; its wings are eight inches acro&s;s; its bill rather more
than four lines; its tail two inches: this is forked, and projects only eight
lines beyond the wings.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="83"> <HI>Colours:</HI> The upper-part of the
head and the rump are red; there is a reddi&s;h bar under the eyes; the
upper-part of the body is variegated with black and ru&s;t colour; the
under-part of the body ru&s;ty, &s;potted with blacki&s;h below the throat; the
belly is white; the legs brown, &s;ome|times black. The nails are very long,
and that of the hind toe is longer than the toe it&s;elf.<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Linnaeus makes the Twite a variety of the Mountain Lin|net; but
Mr. Latham conceives it to be more related to the Red Poll. 
<Q REND="inline">"It is variegated above, rufous below, the
abdomen whiti&s;h, the eye-brows and the bar on the wings tawny, the crown and
rump red."</Q> It is about four inches and a half long. Bri&s;&s;on de&s;cribes
it 
<Q REND="inline">"as blacki&s;h above and varied with rufous,
below tawny; the belly whiti&s;h; the &s;tripe above the eyes ru|fous; having
&s;pots between the bill and the eyes and under the throat of a du&s;ky
blacki&s;h colour, the crown and rump red in the male; (the crown red in the
female;) the tran&s;ver&s;e bar on the wings of a white-rufous; the tail-quills
du&s;ky, the whole of the edges tawny."</Q> If we were to judge from the egg of
the Twite, we &s;hould regard it as a variety of the Red Poll. The egg of the
Twite, though rather &s;maller than that of the Red Poll, is of the &s;ame
&s;hape and colour; only the dots are orange, &s;maller, and more thickly

<P>ALL that is known with regard to the hi&s;tory of this bird
is, that it is found in the kingdom of Angola; that it is very &s;amiliar; that
it is ranked among the fine&s;t warblers of that coun|try; and that its &s;ong
is not the &s;ame with that of our Linnet. The neck, the upper-part of the head
and of the body, are variegated with two &s;orts of brown; the rump has a
beautiful &s;pot of yellow, <PB N="71" REF="85"> which extends to the quills of
the tail: the&s;e quills are brown, edged and tipt with light gray, as al&s;o
the quills of the wings, and their great and middle coverts. The &s;ides of the
head are of a light ru&s;t colour, and there is a brown &s;treak below the
eyes; the under-part of the body and the &s;ides are &s;potted with brown on a
lighter ground.</P>
<P>Edwards, who fir&s;t de&s;cribed this bird, and who has given
a figure of it at the bottom of Pl. 129, is inclined to think it is a female of
another that is repre&s;ented at the top of the &s;ame plate. Thisother bird is
called <HI>Negral</HI> or <HI>Taba|que,</HI> and its &s;ong is much like that
of the Ven|goline. For my own part, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that the &s;ong<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Daines Barrington &s;ays, that the Vengoline excels in point
of &s;ong all the birds of A&s;ia, Africa, and America, except only the
American Mocking Bird.</NOTE> of this makes me doubt of its being a female. I
&s;hould rather &s;uppo&s;e that they are two males of the &s;ame &s;pecies,
but from dif|ferent climates, where each would have a di&s;tinct name; or at
lea&s;t that they are two males of the &s;ame climate, one of which being bred
in a volery, had lo&s;t the lu&s;tre of its plumage, and the other not being
caught before it was adult, or having been kept but a &s;hort time in the cage,
had pre&s;erved its colours better. In fact the colours of the Negral are
richer and more mark|ed than tho&s;e of the Vengoline. The throat, the face,
and the &s;treak below the eyes, are black; <PB N="72" REF="86"> the cheeks
white, the brea&s;t and all the under-part of the body of an orange colour,
without &s;pecks, and which a&s;&s;ume a deeper &s;hade under the belly and the

<P>Our knowledge of this bird is drawn from Edwards. Almo&s;t all
its feathers are blacki&s;h, edged with a lighter colour, which has a reddi&s;h

probably from Brazil, perhaps even from Africa; whereas Cate&s;by's <HI>Little

continues the whole year. Cate&s;by tells us, that it lives upon in&s;ects,

<P>ALL travellers, and after them the naturali&s;ts, have agreed,
that the&s;e &s;mall birds change their colours in moulting. Some even add
intere&s;t|ing particulars which we &s;hould wi&s;h to a&s;certain; that the
varieties of plumage are confined entirely to five principal colours, black,
blue, green, yellow, and red; and that the Bengals never a&s;&s;ume more than
one at a time. Yet per&s;ons who have had an opportunity of ob&s;erving the&s;e
birds in France, and of watching their alterations for a cour&s;e of years,
a&s;&s;ert that they have only one annual moult, and never change their
colour<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">M. Mauduit, well known for his
enlightened ta&s;te in Natural Hi&s;tory, and for his excellent collection of
birds, ob&s;erved a Red Senegal that lived more than a year without changing
his plumage. Ch&acirc;teau &s;ays the &s;ame of all the Bengals which
pa&s;&s;ed through his hands.</NOTE>. This apparent contradiction may be
explained by the difference of climates. That of A&s;ia and Africa, the native
regions of the&s;e birds, is more powerful than ours, and may have greater
influence upon their plumage. But the Bengals are not the only birds which
undergo the change; for, according to Merolla, the Sparrow in Africa becomes
red in the rainy &s;ea&s;on, <PB N="79" REF="93"> and many others are &s;ubject
to &s;imilar alterations. At any rate, an arrangement founded on the colours of
the plumage mu&s;t in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e be totally uncertain; &s;ince, in
their native climate, at lea&s;t, the&s;e pretended characters would only be
momentary, depending on the &s;ea&s;on when the birds was killed. On the other
hand, their com|plexion, which fluctuates in Africa and A&s;ia, is invariable
in Europe; and it becomes difficult to avoid compounding varieties with
&s;pecies. I &s;hall follow therefore the received opinions, and allot a
&s;eparate article to each bird which ap|pears obviou&s;ly di&s;tinct, but
without pretending to decide the number of real &s;pecies, which can be only
the work of time.</P>
<P>We &s;hould be much mi&s;taken if we inferred from the names of
the&s;e birds, that they are confined to Bengal and Senegal: they are &s;pread
through the greate&s;t part of A&s;ia and Africa, and even in many of the
adjacent i&s;lands, &s;uch as tho&s;e of Madaga&s;car, Bourbon, France, and
Java, &amp;c. We may even expect &s;oon to find them multiplied in America; for
De Sonini lately &s;et at liberty a great number of them in the I&s;le of
Cayenne, and afterwards &s;aw them cheerful and lively, &s;trongly di&s;po&s;ed
to natu|ralize in a foreign &s;oil, and perpetuate their race<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A few years ago a Red Senegal was killed at Cayenne in a
&s;avanna; it had certainly been carried thither by &s;ome navigators.</NOTE>.
We may hope that the&s;e new coloni&s;ts, who&s;e plumage is &s;o variable,
will al&s;o &s;uffer the influ|ence <PB N="80" REF="94"> of an American
climate, and other varie|ties will be produced, more fit however to decorate
our cabinets than to enrich Natural Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The Bengals are familiar and de&s;tructive birds: in a word,
they are real Sparrows. They vi&s;it the hou&s;es and even appear in the middle
of the villages, and alight in numerous bodies in the fields &s;owed with
millet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Travellers in&s;orm us, that the negroes eat
certain &s;mall birds entire with their feathers, and the&s;e birds re&s;emble
Linnets. I imagine that Senegals are of the number, for &s;ome Senegals in the
time of moulting are like Linnets. Be&s;ides, it is &s;aid that the negroes eat
the &s;mall birds entire, only to retaliate for the damage done among their
crops, the&s;e ne&s;tling in the mid&s;t of the &s;owed fields.</NOTE>; for
they prefer this grain: they are al&s;o fond of bathing.</P>
<P>In Senegal, they are caught under a caleba&s;h, or large gourd,
which is placed upon the ground, and rai&s;ed a little by a &s;hort prop, to
which a long cord is fa&s;tened; a few grains of millet &s;erve for the bait.
The per&s;on who watches their motions without being perceived, draws at the
proper time, and &s;ecures whatever is under the caleba&s;h; Bengals, Senegals,
and &s;mall black Sparrows with white bellies, &amp;c.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I owe the detail of this &s;port to M. de Sonini.</NOTE> The&s;e
birds are tran&s;ported with difficulty, and can hardly be reconciled to a
different climate; but when once naturalized, they live &s;ix or &s;even years,
that is longer than many &s;pecies proper to the country. They have even bred
in Holland; and the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s would undoubtedly be had 
<PB N="81" REF="95"> in colder places; for the&s;e birds are very gentle and

<P>AS the in&s;tincts and habits are nearly the &s;ame in the whole
of this family of birds, I &s;hall content my&s;elf, in this and the following
articles, to &s;ubjoin to the general account, the delinea|tion of the peculiar
features of each. In ca&s;es &s;uch as the pre&s;ent, where the principal
object is to convey ideas of the richne&s;s and variety of the plumage, we
ought to quit the pen for the pencil; at lea&s;t, we mu&s;t imitate the painter
in de&s;cribing not only the forms and lineaments, <PB N="82" REF="96"> but in
repre&s;enting the &s;portive fluctuation of tints, their changing
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion and combination, and above all in expre&s;&s;ing action,
motion, and life.</P>
<P>The Bengal has on each &s;ide of its head a &s;ort of purple
cre&s;cent which lies under the eyes, and marks the phy&s;iognomy of this
little bird.</P>
<P>The throat is light blue, and the &s;ame colour &s;preads over
all the lower parts of the body, as far as the end of the tail, and even over
the upper coverts. All the upper-part of the body, including the wings, is of a
plea&s;ant gray.</P>
<P>In &s;ome individuals, this &s;ame gray, &s;ome|what lighter, is
the colour of the belly and of the lower coverts of the tail.</P>
<P>In other &s;pecimens brought from Aby&s;|&s;inia, this gray had
a tinge of red on the belly.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, in others there is no purple cre&s;cent under the
eyes; and this variety, known by the name of <HI>Blue Cord</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cordon Bleu,</HI> Knight of the order of the Holy
Gho&s;t.</NOTE>, is more common than that fir&s;t de&s;cribed. It is &s;aid to
be a female; but, as it is &s;o frequent, I &s;hould rather &s;uppo&s;e that
the appearance is owing to the difference of age or climate. Mr. Bruce, who has
&s;een this bird in Aby&s;&s;inia, po&s;itively a&s;&s;ures us, that the two
red &s;pots are not found in the female, and that all her colours are le&s;s
brilliant. He adds, that <PB N="83" REF="97"> the male has an agreeable warble,
but he never remarked that of the female: in both, the bill and the legs are
reddi&s;h.</P>
<P>Edwards has figured and coloured a <HI>Blue Cord (the
Blue-bellied Finch)</HI> which was brought from the coa&s;t of Angola, where
the Portugue&s;e called it <HI>Azulinha.</HI> It differed from the preceding;
the upper-part of the body be|ing of a brown cinereous, &s;lightly tinged with
purple, the bill of a deep fle&s;h colour, and the legs brown. The plumage of
the female was of a cinereous brown, with a flight tinge of blue on the
lower-part of the body only. It would &s;eem to be a variety from the climate,
in which neither &s;ex has the red &s;pot under the eyes; and this accounts for
the frequency of the <HI>Blue Cords.</HI> It is a very lively bird. Ed|wards
remarks that its bill is like that of the Goldfinch. He takes no notice of its
&s;ong, not having an opportunity of hearing it.</P>
<P>The Bengal is of the &s;ize of the <HI>Sizerin;</HI> its total
length is four inches nine lines; its bill four lines; its tail two inches,
unequally taper|ing, and con&s;i&s;ting of twelve quills; its extent &s;ix or

yellow.</P>

<P>Of all the Bengals which I have &s;een, this is the mo&s;t
&s;peckled. The whole upper part of the body, the &s;uperior coverts of the
tail and wings, and the quills of the wings next the back, were &s;prinkled
with points; the wings were brown, and the lateral quills of the tail black,
edged with white. Brown mixed with a dull red was &s;pread over all the upper
part of the body, including the coverts of the tail, and even under the belly;
a red not &s;o du&s;ky ex|tended over all the re&s;t of the under-part of the
body, and the &s;ides of the head; the bill was al&s;o of a dull red, and the
legs of a light yellow.</P>
<P>The female, according to Bri&s;&s;on, is never punctured; it
differs al&s;o from the male, as its neck, brea&s;t, and belly, are of a
pale|yellow, and the throat white. According to other ob&s;ervers, who had many
opportunities of <PB N="86" REF="101"> repeatedly &s;eeing the&s;e birds alive,
the female was entirely brown, and without &s;pots. Is this a variety of
plumage, or a difference of de&s;crip|tion? for the latter is no &s;mall
&s;ource of confu|&s;ion in natural hi&s;tory. Willughby &s;aw &s;everal of
the&s;e birds which came from the Ea&s;t Indies, and, as we may expect, found
&s;everal differences among the individuals; &s;ome had black wings; in others
the brea&s;t was of that colour; in others the brea&s;t and belly were
blacke&s;t; in others the legs whiti&s;h: in all the nails were very long, and
more incurvated than tho&s;e of the lark. There is rea&s;on to believe that
&s;ome of the&s;e birds were in moult; for I ob&s;erved one in which the
lower-belly was blacki&s;h, and all the re&s;t of the plumage indecided, as
happens when the feathers are dropped, the colours pe|culiar to the &s;pecies
being impre&s;&s;ed, but not well di&s;criminated.</P>
<P>The &s;pecimen de&s;cribed by Bri&s;&s;on came from the

their warble was very plea&s;ant; &s;everal of them were kept toge|ther in the
&s;ame cage, becau&s;e they di&s;liked the &s;ociety of other birds.</P>
<P>The Speckled Bengal is of a &s;ize intermediate to the two

and tho&s;e which have been noticed by others, create &s;ome 
<PB N="90" REF="105"> doubts of the perfect &s;imilarity of the &s;exes. I have
&s;een &s;everal which came from the Cape, in &s;ome of which the upper-part of
the body was more or le&s;s of a deep brown, and the under more or le&s;s
reddi&s;h; in others the upper-part of the head had no rays. In that figured by
Edwards, Pl. 179, the rays con&s;i&s;ted of two browns; and the coverts below
the tail were not black, which is al&s;o the ca&s;e with what we have
repre&s;ented N^o 157, fig. 2. La&s;tly, in the &s;pecimen delineated at the
top of Pl. 354, the rays of the under-part of the body are &s;pread upon a
brown ground; and not only the lower coverts of the tail are black, as in that
de&s;cribed by Bri&s;&s;on, but the lower belly is of the &s;ame colour.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject ob&s;erved by Bri&s;&s;on came from Senegal. The
two which Edwards examined were brought from the Ea&s;t Indies; and mo&s;t of
tho&s;e which I have &s;een were brought from the Cape of Good Hope. Among &s;o
many differences of the plumage remarked between the&s;e, &s;ome mu&s;t depend
upon the di&s;tinction of &s;ex.</P>
<P>The average length of the&s;e birds is about four inches and a
half; the bill is three or four lines; the alar extent &s;ix inches, and the
tail two inches, unequally tapered, and compo&s;ed of twelve quills.</P>

<P>THIS bird has great power in its bill, with which it nips &s;o
bitterly as to draw blood. Hence, according to the &s;everal authors, the
French name of <HI>Pin&s;on</HI> is derived (from <HI>pincer,</HI> to pinch).
But as the di&s;po&s;ition to &s;nap is not peculiar to the Chaffinch, but
common to other birds, to many different &s;orts of quadrupeds, millepedes,
&amp;c. I &s;hould rather adopt the opi|nion of Fri&s;ch, who &s;uppo&s;es this
word <HI>Pin&s;on</HI> to come from <HI>Pincio,</HI> latinized for the German
<HI>Pinck,</HI> which &s;eems imitative of the note of the bird.</P>
<P>The Chaffinches do not all migrate in the autumn; a

</FIGURE> <PB N="97" REF="114"> to our plea&s;ures: for in that
&s;ea&s;on they never &s;ing, except in fine days, which &s;eldom then occur.
During the re&s;t of the time they lodge concealed in clo&s;e hedges, in oaks
that have not &s;hed all their leaves, in evergreens, and even in holes of
rocks, where they are &s;ometimes found dead when the weather is
exce&s;&s;ively &s;e|vere. Tho&s;e which migrate into other climates
a&s;&s;emble often in prodigious flocks; but whither do they retire? Fri&s;ch
&s;uppo&s;es that their retreat lies in the northern regions: his rea&s;ons
are; 1. That on their return, they bring with them white Chaffinches, which are
hardly to be met with, except in tho&s;e climates; 2. That they never lead
young ones in their train, which would be the ca&s;e, if, during their
ab&s;ence, they lived in a warm country, where they might be di&s;po&s;ed to
breed; 3. That they can bear cold, except &s;now, which covering the fields,
deprives them in part of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fri&s;ch.&mdash;Aldrovandus &s;ays, that in Italy, when there is
much &s;now and the fro&s;t very inten&s;e, the Chaffinches cannot fly, and are
caught by the hand; but this weakne&s;s may ari&s;e from inanition, and that
again from the abundance of &s;now. Olina alleges, that in the &s;ame country
the Chaffinches retire to the hilly tracts during the &s;ummer. Hebert has
&s;een many of them in that &s;ea&s;on among the highe&s;t mountains of Bugey,
where they were as common as in the plains, and where they certainly do not
remain through the winter.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The&s;e arguments imply therefore, that there is a country in
the north where the earth is not robed in the winter; and &s;uch is &s;aid to
be the <PB N="98" REF="115"> de&s;arts of Tartary, where the &s;now falls
indeed, but is immediately &s;wept away by the violence of the winds, and
exten&s;ive tracts laid bare.</P>
<P>A very remarkable circum&s;tance in the migra|tion of the
Chaffinches, is what Ge&s;ner men|tions of tho&s;e of Switzerland, and Linnaeus
of tho&s;e of Sweden: that only the females remove to other climates, and the
males re&s;ide in the country during the winter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"They quit Switzerland in the winter,
particularly the fe|males; for &s;everal males are often &s;een, with not one
female." 
<BIBL>GESNER.</BIBL></Q> Linnaeus po&s;itively a&s;&s;erts,
that the female Chaffinches leave Sweden in flocks about the month of
September, that they direct their cour&s;e to Holland, and return in the
&s;pring to join their males which have wintered in Sweden.</P> 
<P>This &s;ingular remark is corroborated by Mr. White, who
found that the va&s;t flocks of Chaffinches which appear in his neighbour|hood
about Chri&s;tmas, are almo&s;t entirely hens. Yet, as he &s;eems not to have
di&s;&s;ected any, he might have been deceived by the change of plumage, which
is extremely probable.</P></NOTE>. But have not the&s;e able naturali&s;ts been
mi&s;led by the per|&s;ons who informed them, and tho&s;e deceived by &s;ome
periodical change in the plumage of the females, occa&s;ioned by cold, or other
accidents? This explanation &s;eems more &s;uited to Nature's general plan, and
more conformable to analogy, than to &s;uppo&s;e that, at a certain fixed term,
the females &s;eparate from mere caprice, and travel into a di&s;tant climate,
when their native &s;oil can afford them &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>The migrations vary in different countries. Aldrovandus
a&s;&s;ures us, that the Chaffinches &s;el|dom breed near Bologna, but almo&s;t
all depart <PB N="99" REF="116"> about the end of winter, and return the
&s;ucceed|ing autumn. On the other hand, I find from Willughby, that they
continue the whole year in England, and that few birds are &s;o com|mon.</P>
<P>They are &s;pread through the whole of Europe, from the &s;hores
of the Baltic and Sweden, where they are frequent, and ne&s;tle, to the Straits

<P>The time for the &s;port is, when the Chaf|finches fly in
numerous flocks, either in autumn before their departure, or in &s;pring on

<P>The&s;e birds con&s;truct their ne&s;t very round and compact,
and place it in the clo&s;e&s;t trees or bu&s;hes; &s;ometimes they build it
even in our gardens upon the fruit-trees, and conceal it &s;o artfully that we
can hardly perceive it, though quite nigh. It is compo&s;ed of white mo&s;s and
&s;mall roots on the out&s;ide, and lined with wool, hairs, &s;piders-webs, and
feathers. The female lays five or &s;ix eggs, which are reddi&s;h gray,
&s;prinkled with blacki&s;h &s;pots, more frequent near the large end. The male
never de&s;erts his mate in the time of hatching; he &s;its at night always at
hand; and if during the day he remove to a &s;hort di&s;tance, it is only to
procure food. Jealou&s;y has perhaps &s;ome &s;hare in this exce&s;&s;ive
a&s;&s;iduity; for the&s;e birds are of an amorous com|plexion: when two males
meet in an orchard in the &s;pring, they fight ob&s;tinately, till one of them
is vanqui&s;hed and expelled: and the com|bat is &s;till more fierce if they be
lodged in the &s;ame volery with only a &s;ingle female.</P>
<P>The parents feed their brood with caterpillars and in&s;ects:
they al&s;o eat the&s;e them&s;elves, but their ordinary &s;ub&s;i&s;tence is
&s;mall &s;eeds, tho&s;e of the white thorn, of poppy, of burdock, of the
ro&s;e-tree, and e&s;pecially beech-ma&s;t, rape and <PB N="103" REF="120">
hemp &s;eed. They feed al&s;o upon wheat and even oats, and are expert in
&s;helling the grain to obtain the mealy &s;ub&s;tance. Though rather
ob&s;tinate, they can in time be in&s;tructed like Goldfinches to perform
&s;everal little feats; they learn to employ their wings and feet to draw up
the cup when they want to eat or drink.</P>
<P>The Chaffinch &s;its oftener &s;quatted than perched; it never
walks hopping, but trips lightly along the ground, and is con&s;tantly bu&s;y
in picking up &s;omething: its flight is unequal; but when its ne&s;t is
attacked, it hovers above &s;creaming.</P>
<P>This bird is &s;omewhat &s;maller than our Spar|row, and is too
well known to require a minute decription. The &s;ides of the head, the
fore|part of the neck, the brea&s;t, and the loins are of a wine colour: the
upper-part of the head and of the body che&s;nut; the rump olive, and a white
&s;pot on the wing. In the female the bill is more &s;lender, and the colours
le&s;s bright than in the male; but in both &s;exes the plumage is very
&s;ubject to vary. I have &s;een a hen Cha&s;&s;inch alive, caught on her eggs
the 7^t^h of May, which differed from that de&s;cribed by Bri&s;&s;on: the
upper-part of its head and back was of a brown olive, a &s;ort of gray collar
&s;ur|rounded the neck behind, the belly and the lower coverts of the tail were
white, &amp;c. And of the males, &s;ome have the upper-part of the head 
<PB N="104" REF="121"> and neck cinereous, and others of a brown che&s;nut; in
&s;ome the quills of the tail near|e&s;t the two middle ones are edged with
white, and in others they are entirely black. Does age occa&s;ion the&s;e
&s;light differences?</P>
<P>A young Chaffinch was taken from its mother, when its
tail-quills were &s;ix lines in length, and the under-part of its body was like
that of its mother; and the upper-part of a brown cine|reous; the rump olive;
the wings were already marked with white rays: but the edges of the &s;uperior
mandible were not yet &s;calloped near the point as in the adult males. This
circum|&s;tance would lead me to &s;uppo&s;e that the &s;cal|loping which
occurs in many &s;pecies is not the primary organization, but is afterwards
pro|duced by the continual pre&s;&s;ure of the end of the lower mandible, which
is rather &s;horter, again&s;t the &s;ides of the upper.</P>
<P>All the Chaffinches have the tail forked, com|po&s;ed of twelve

<P>PERHAPS this bird, which in general is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the
Mountain Finch, or <HI>Oro&s;piza</HI> of Ari&s;totle, is in fact his
<HI>Spiza,</HI> or principal Finch; or our Common Finch or Chaffinch is his
Mountain Finch. The following are the rea&s;ons which incline me to this
opinion. The ancients never made complete de&s;criptions, but &s;eized a
prominent feature of an animal, whether in its exterior appearance or in its
habits, and marked it by an epithet. The <HI>Oro&s;piza,</HI> &s;ays
Ari&s;totle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is &s;uppo&s;ed to be Ari&s;totle's

Mitred. In Ger|man, <HI>Rowert, Schnec-Finck, Winter-Finck:</HI> in Swi&s;s.
<HI>Wald-Finck, Thanu-Finck:</HI> in Swedi&s;h, <HI>Norrquint.</HI></NOTE>, is
like the <HI>Spiza;</HI> it is &s;omewhat &s;maller; its neck is blue; and
la&s;tly, it inhabits the mountains: but all the&s;e are properties of the
Chaffinch, and &s;ome of them belong to it exclu&s;ively.</P>
<P N="1">I. It is much like the Mountain Finch or Brambling, as
will appear from the compari&s;on; and all &s;y&s;tematic writers have
cla&s;&s;ed them to|gether.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="109" REF="126"> 2. The Chaffinch is rather
&s;maller than the Brambling, according to naturali&s;ts, and which agrees with
my own ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P N="3">3. In the Chaffinch, the upper-parts of the head and of
the neck are of a blui&s;h cinereous; whereas in the Brambling the&s;e are
varied with glo&s;&s;y black and yellowi&s;h gray.</P>
<P N="4">4. We have already remarked, on the autho|rity of Olina,
that in Italy the Chaffinch retires in &s;ummer to breed among the mountains;
and, as the climate of Greece is little different from that of Italy, we may
infer from analogy, it will there al&s;o have the &s;ame habits<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fri&s;ch a&s;&s;erts that the Bramblings come from the mountains
in autumn, and when they return they direct their cour&s;e to the north. The
Marquis de Piolenc, who has given me &s;everal notes on the&s;e birds,
a&s;&s;ures me that they leave the mountains of Savoy and Dauphiny in October,
and do not return till February. The&s;e periods corre&s;pond well with the
time when they are &s;een to pa&s;s and repa&s;s in Burgundy.&mdash;Perhaps
both the&s;e &s;pecies re&s;emble each other in preferring
mountains.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="5">5. La&s;tly, the <HI>Spiza</HI> of Ari&s;totle appears to
re&s;ort, according to that philo&s;opher, to the warm regions during &s;ummer,
and to prefer the cold climates in winter<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus po&s;itively a&s;&s;erts, that this takes place in the
neighbourhood of Bologna: Lottinger informs me, that &s;ome appear in Lorraine
from the end of Augu&s;t, but that large flocks arrive towards the end of
October, and even later.</NOTE>. But this agrees better with the Brambling than
with the Chaffinches, &s;ince of the&s;e a great proportion never migrate,
while the former not only are birds of pa&s;&s;age, but <PB N="110" REF="127">
generally arrive in the depth of winter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Hi&s;t. Anim.</HI> lib. viii. 3.</BIBL></NOTE> in the
different countries which they vi&s;it. This is evinced by experience, and is
confirmed by the appellations of Winter-Finch, and Snow-Finch, which they have
received in various places.</P>
<P>From all the&s;e con&s;iderations, it &s;eems probable that the
Brambling is the <HI>Spiza</HI> of Ari&s;totle, and the Chaffinch his
<HI>Oro&s;piza.</HI></P>
<P>The Bramblings do not breed in our climates; they arrive in
different years in immen&s;e flocks. The time of their pa&s;&s;age is the
autumn and winter: often they retire in eight or ten days, and &s;ometimes they
remain till the &s;pring. Dur|ing their &s;tay, they con&s;ort with the
Chaffinches, and, like the&s;e, &s;eek concealment in the thick foliage. Va&s;t
bodies of them appeared in Bur|gundy in the winter of 1774, and other in
&s;till more numerous flocks were &s;een in the country of Wirtemberg about the
end of December 1775, which every evening repo&s;ed in a valley adjoin|ing to
the banks of the Rhine<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"> 
<P>Lottinger a&s;&s;erts perhaps too generally, that in the
day-time they &s;pread through the fore&s;ts of the plain, and in the evening
retire to the mountains. This conduct is not invariable, but &s;eems to be
affected by &s;ituation and circum&s;tances.</P> 
<P> A flock of more than three hundred were &s;een this year in
our neighbourhood; it halted three or four days in the &s;ame place, which is
mountainous. They always alighted on the &s;ame che&s;|nut-tree, and when
&s;ired at, ro&s;e all at once, and con&s;tantly directed their cour&s;e to the
north and north-ea&s;t. 
<BIBL><HI>Note of the Marquis</HI>
PIOLENC.</BIBL></P></NOTE>, and commenced <PB N="111" REF="128"> their flight
with the earlie&s;t dawn: the ground was covered with their excrements. The
&s;ame occurrence was ob&s;erved in the year 1735 and in 1757<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Gazette d' Agriculture,</HI> Ann. 1776.</BIBL></NOTE>.
Never perhaps were &s;o many of the&s;e birds &s;een in Lorraine, as in the
winter of 1765: more than &s;ix hundred dozen, &s;ays Lottinger, were killed
every night in the pine-fore&s;ts, which are four or five leagues from
Sarbourg. The people were not at the pains to &s;hoot them, they knocked them
down with &s;witches; and though this ma&s;|&s;acre la&s;ted the whole winter,
the body was &s;carce perceptibly thinned. Willughby tells us, that many are
&s;een in the neighbourhood of Venice, no doubt in the time of pa&s;&s;age; but
no where do they appear &s;o regularly as in the fore&s;ts of Wei&s;&s;emburg,
which are plentifully &s;tocked with beeches, and con&s;equently afford
abundance of ma&s;t, of which they are &s;o fond, that they eat it day and
night; they live al&s;o on all &s;orts of &s;mall &s;eeds. I &s;uppo&s;e that
the&s;e birds remain in their native climate as long as they can procure the
proper food, and quit it only when &s;carcity obliges them to &s;hift their
quarters; at lea&s;t, it is certain that the plenty of their fa|vourite &s;eeds
is not &s;ufficient to draw them to a country, and even to one with which they
are acquainted: for in 1774, when there was abundance of beech ma&s;t in
Lorraine, the Bramblings did not appear, but took a different 
<PB N="112" REF="129"> route: however, in the following year, &s;everal flocks
were &s;een, though there was a &s;carcity of ma&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I
owe tho&s;e facts to Mr. Lottinger.</NOTE>. When they arrive among us, they are
not &s;hy, but allow a per&s;on to go very near them. They fly clo&s;e
together, and alight and ri&s;e in the &s;ame compact body; and for this
rea&s;on twelve or fifteen of them may be killed at one &s;hot.</P>
<P>When they feed in the &s;ields, they are ob|&s;erved to perform
the &s;ame manoeuvres as the pigeons; a few always precede, and are follow|ed
by the re&s;t of the flock.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds, we &s;ee, are known and &s;pread through all
parts of Europe; but they are not confined to our quarter of the globe. Edwards
ob&s;erved &s;ome that were brought from Hud|&s;on's-bay, under the name of
<HI>Snow-birds;</HI> and people who traded to that country a&s;&s;ured him that
they were the fir&s;t which appeared every year on the return of &s;pring,
before even the &s;nows were melted.</P>
<P>The fle&s;h of the Bramblings, though &s;ome|what bitter, is
good to eat, and undoubtedly better than that of the Chaffinch. Their plu|mage
is al&s;o more varied, more beautiful, and more glo&s;&s;y; but their &s;ong is
far from being &s;o plea&s;ant, and it has been compared to the &s;creech of
the owl<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Belon.</BIBL></NOTE> and the
mewing of the cat<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Olina.</BIBL></NOTE>.
They have two cries; the one a &s;ort <PB N="113" REF="130"> of chirping, and
the other which they utter when they &s;it on the ground re&s;embles that of
the Stone-chat, but is neither &s;o &s;trong nor &s;o clear. Though by nature
endowed with &s;o few talents, the&s;e birds are &s;u&s;ceptible of
in|&s;truction; and when kept near another who&s;e warble is more plea&s;ant,
their &s;ong gradually mellows, and comes to re&s;emble that which they
hear<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Olina.</BIBL></NOTE>. But to have a ju&s;t
idea of their mu&s;ic, we mu&s;t li&s;ten to them in the time of hatching; it
is then, when chanting the hymn of love, that birds di&s;play their true
warble.</P>
<P>A fowler, who had travelled, a&s;&s;ured me that the&s;e birds
are bred in Luxemburg; that they make their ne&s;ts in the mo&s;t branchy firs
at a con&s;iderable height; that they begin about the end of April; that they
employ the long mo&s;s of firs for the out&s;ide, and hair, wool, and fea|thers
for the lining; that the female lays four or five yellowi&s;h &s;potted eggs;
and that they begin to flutter from branch to branch about the end of May.</P>
<P>The Brambling is, according to Belon, a cou|rageous bird, and
defends it&s;elf with its bill to the la&s;t ga&s;p. All agree that it is of a
more ea&s;y temper than the Chaffinch, and more readily en&s;nared. Many of
them are killed in certain fowling-matches which are frequent in the coun|try
of Wei&s;&s;emburg, and which de&s;erve to be re|lated. <PB N="114" REF="131">
The fowlers a&s;&s;emble at the little town of Bergzabern; on the evening of
the day ap|pointed, they di&s;patch &s;couts to remark the trees on which the
Bramblings commonly pa&s;s the night, and which are generally the pitch-pines,
and other ever-greens; the &s;couts, after their return, &s;erve as guides for
the company, which &s;et out in the evening with torches and
&s;hooting|trunks<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sarbacanes.</HI></NOTE>. The
birds are dazzled with the glare, and killed by pellets of dry earth
di&s;charged from the trunks. They &s;hoot very near, le&s;t they &s;hould
mi&s;s; for if a bird chanced to be wounded, its cries would &s;care away the
flock.</P>
<P>The principal food of the&s;e birds, when kept in a cage, is
panic, hemp-&s;eed, and beech|ma&s;t. Olina &s;ays that they live four or five
years.</P>
<P>Their plumage varies: in &s;ome males the throat is black; in
others, the head is entirely white, and the colours in general lighter<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Aldrovandus.</BIBL></NOTE>. Fri&s;ch remarks,
that the young males are not &s;o black at their arrival, and that the inferior
co|verts of their wings are not &s;o vivid a yellow as at their departure.
Perhaps a more advanced age occa&s;ions &s;till other differences between the
&s;exes, and may account for the diver&s;ity of de&s;criptions.</P>
<P>The Brambling which I ob&s;erved weighed an ounce; its face was
black; the upper-part of its <PB N="115" REF="132"> head, neck, and back,
varied with yellowi&s;h|gray, and glo&s;&s;y-black; the throat, the fore-part
of the neck, the brea&s;t, and the rump, ru&s;t-co|loured; the &s;mall coverts
of the ba&s;e of the wing, yellow-orange; the others formed two tran&s;ver&s;e
rays of a yellowi&s;h-white, &s;eparated by a broader black bar; all the quills
of the wing, except the three fir&s;t, had on their outer edge, where the great
coverts terminate, a white &s;pot, about five lines long; the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
of the&s;e &s;pots formed a third white ray, which was parallel to the two
others when the wing was expanded, but when the wing was clo&s;ed it ap|peared
only like an oblong &s;pot almo&s;t parallel to the &s;ide of the quills;
la&s;tly, the&s;e quills were of an exceedingly fine black, edged with white.
The &s;mall inferior coverts of the wings next the body were di&s;tingui&s;hed
by their beautiful yel|low colour. The quills of the tail were black, edged
with white, or whiti&s;h; the tail forked; the flanks &s;treaked with black;
the legs of a brown-olive; the nails &s;lightly incurvated, the hind one the
&s;tronge&s;t of all; the edges of the upper mandible &s;calloped near the
point, the edges of the lower one fitted into the upper; and the tongue parted
at the tip into &s;everal delicate filaments.</P>

<P>ALL the &s;pecies of Widows are inhabitants of Africa; but they
are not entirely con|fined to that region, for they occur in A&s;ia, and even
in the Philippine I&s;lands. They all have a conical bill of &s;ufficient
&s;trength to break the &s;eeds on which they feed: they all are
di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by a long tail, or rather by long feathers, which in mo&s;t
of the males accompany the true tail, and are in&s;erted above or below its
origin: la&s;tly, all, or nearly all of them, are &s;ubject to two annual
moultings, the interval between which corre&s;ponds to the rainy &s;ea&s;on,
and la&s;ts &s;ix or eight months, during which the males lo&s;e not only their
long tail, but their rich colour and plea&s;ant warble<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The melody of their &s;ong is one of the rea&s;ons that induces
Edwards to cla&s;s them with the Finches rather than with the Sparrows.</NOTE>;
and it is not before the return of &s;pring that they recover the attributes or
ornaments of their &s;ex.</P>
<P>The females undergo the &s;ame moultings, but not only is the
change le&s;s perceptible in them, but the colours of their plumage are not
&s;o much affected.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="150"> The period of the fir&s;t moulting in the
young males mu&s;t evidently depend on the time of their birth: tho&s;e of the
earlie&s;t hatch a&s;&s;ume their long tail in May; but tho&s;e hatched
late&s;t in the &s;ea&s;on, do not a&s;&s;ume it till September or October.</P>
<P>Travellers a&s;&s;ert that the Widows con&s;truct their ne&s;t
with cotton, and that they divide it into two &s;tories<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Kolben's de&s;cription of the Cape of Good Hope. It
appears very probable, that the changeable-plumaged Gold|&s;inches, of which he
&s;peaks, are really Widow-birds.</NOTE>, the upper being de&s;tined for the
male, and the under for the female. It is po&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain this
circum&s;tance in Europe, and even in France, where by a careful atten|tion the
Widows may be made to lay and hatch, as is &s;ucce&s;sfully practi&s;ed in
Holland.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds are lively and volatile, and are con&s;tantly
rai&s;ing and dropping the tail: they are very fond of bathing, not at all
&s;ubject to di&s;ea&s;es, and live twelve or fifteen years. They are fed with
a mixture of &s;pikenard and millet; and by way of cooling, they have leaves of
&s;uccory.</P>
<P>It is &s;omewhat odd that the name of Widows, by which they are
now generally known, and which &s;eems to be very applicable to both, becau&s;e
of the black that predominates in their plu|mage, and becau&s;e of their train
at the tail, owed its origin to a mere mi&s;take. The Portu|gue&s;e 
<PB N="134" REF="151"> called them at fir&s;t <HI>Birds of Whidha</HI> (that
is, of Juida), becau&s;e they are very common on that coa&s;t of Africa; and
foreigners were de|ceived by the &s;imilarity between that word and the name of
Widow in the Portugue&s;e tongue<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Edwards was led into
this mi&s;take, which he afterwards di&s;covered.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>We &s;hall here treat of eight &s;pecies of Widows; viz. the
five already known and de&s;cribed by Bri&s;&s;on; two new ones which are
already di&s;|tingui&s;hed by a beautiful red &s;pot on the wing, and another
on the brea&s;t: la&s;tly, to the&s;e I &s;hall add the Bird which Bri&s;&s;on

coverts of the under-part of the tail blacki&s;h; the head, throat, fore-part

formed as in other birds; it con&s;i&s;ts of twelve quills nearly equal, and
covered by four long feathers, which ri&s;e al&s;o from the rump, but
&s;omewhat higher; the two longe&s;t are about thirteen inches, and are black,
like tho&s;e of the tail, and appear waved, and as it were clouded; a little
arched like tho&s;e of the cock; their breadth, which is nine lines near the
rump, is reduced to three near the extremity: the &s;horte&s;t are inclo&s;ed

<P>The young females are nearly of the colour of the males in

brighter on the neck than on the brea&s;t, and extending behind the neck, it
forms an half collar, which is broader the lower the black hood de&s;cends from

are four or five times longer than tho&s;e of the &s;ide, and the two middle
ones are the longe&s;t of all. In moulting, the male becomes like the Linnet,

<P>If length of tail be the di&s;tingui&s;hing charac|ter of the
Widow birds, this is the lea&s;t entitled to that appellation; for the
longe&s;t quills of its tail &s;carcely exceed four inches. It has received the
name of <HI>Dominican,</HI> on account of its black and white plumage; all the
upper-part of the body is variegated with the&s;e two colours; the rump, and
the &s;uperior coverts of the tail, are mottled with dirty white and
blacki&s;h; the up|per-part of the head of a white-reddi&s;h, en|circled with
black; the throat, the fore-part of the neck, and the brea&s;t, of the &s;ame
white, which al&s;o extends behind, and forms a half|collar 
<PB N="139" REF="157"> on the po&s;terior &s;urface of the neck. The belly has
none of the rufous tinge. The bill is red, and the legs gray.</P>
<P>This &s;pecies undergoes two moultings annu|ally, like the
preceding; in the interval the male is dive&s;ted of its long tail, and its
white is dirtier. The female never has the&s;e long fea|thers of the tail, and
its plumage is con&s;tantly of an almo&s;t uniform brown.</P>
<P>Length to the end of the tail, &s;ix inches and one fourth; to
the end of the nails, four inches; the bill four lines and a half; the legs
&s;even lines; the mid-toe &s;even lines and a half; the alar extent &s;even

he thence concluded, that when the male moulted its plumage it was more
uniform. But this would apply better to the female than to the male; and yet
there is a wide difference between blui&s;h-black, which is the colour of the
Brenoud, and uniform brown, which is that of the female Domini|can. This

But the&s;e white-points vary in their number and arrangement; and in general

adopted and improved it.</NOTE>. This has been experienced both by Salerne and

on the other hand, the hen Canary, if &s;eparated from the males, will
con&s;ort with the cock Gold|finch<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This circum&s;tance

a&s;&s;ociate with the cock Goldfinch; and that it is only when neglected by
their own &s;pecies that they join the &s;tranger, in which ca&s;e they always
make the fir&s;t advances.</NOTE>. <PB N="165" REF="188"> The female is the
fir&s;t to feel the ar|dour of pa&s;&s;ion, and endeavours, by all alluring

adultery: and yet there mu&s;t be no female of his own &s;pecies in the volery.
The preliminaries la&s;t commonly &s;ix weeks, during which time the hen Canary
makes a complete laying of addle eggs, for which her ince&s;&s;ant
&s;olicitations have not procured fecundation; what in animals may be termed
lu&s;t, is almo&s;t always &s;ubordinate to the great end of nature, the
reproduction of the &s;pecies. Father Bougot, whom I have al|ready quoted with
approbation, has ob&s;erved with attention the little manoeuvres of the
va|riegated female Canary in &s;uch &s;ituations: &s;he often approached the
male Goldfinch, and &s;quatted like a common hen, but with more
ex|pre&s;&s;ion, to invite him to the fruition: at fir&s;t he is deaf to her
&s;olicitations, but the flame &s;teals upon him by degrees<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I have heard it alleged that the Goldfinch was a cold bird; he may
be &s;o in compari&s;on of the Canaries, but after he is rou&s;ed, he appears
much animated; the male has frequently been ob&s;erved to drop in an epileptit
fit, while he chanted rapturou&s;ly in the height of his pa&s;&s;ion.</NOTE>:
often he be|gins the embrace, and his re&s;olution as often 
<PB N="166" REF="189"> fails; at each attempt he &s;preads his wings and gives
vent to feeble cries. However, after the union is accompli&s;hed, he proceeds
to di&s;charge the duties of a parent; he a&s;&s;i&s;ts his mate in
con&s;tructing the ne&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They prefer mo&s;s and dry
gra&s;s for the materials.</NOTE>, and carries food to her while &s;he is
engaged in hatching, or in rearing her young.</P>
<P>Though the&s;e con&s;trained amours will &s;ome|times &s;ucceed
with a hen Canary and a wild Goldfinch, it is better to rai&s;e together
tho&s;e in|tended for breeding, and not to pair them till they are two years
old. The offspring re&s;em|bles more the father in the &s;hape of the bill, in
the colours of the head and of the wings, and in &s;hort in all the
extremities, and the mother in the re&s;t of the body: they have al&s;o been
remarked to be &s;tronger, and live longer; and to have a clearer natural
warble, but to be not &s;o docile in adopting the notes of our artificial
mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>The&s;e hybrids are &s;till capable of propagating, and when
they are paired with the hen Canary, the &s;econd generation has a manife&s;t
analogy to the &s;pecies of the Goldfinch<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hebert.</BIBL></NOTE>; &s;o much does the male influence
predominate in the act of generation.</P>
<P>The Goldfinch flies low, but with an even continued motion, like
the Linnet; and not by jerks and bounds, like the Sparrow. It is an 
<PB N="167" REF="190"> active and laborious bird; if not employed in pecking
the heads of poppies, of hemp, or of thi&s;tles, it is con&s;tantly bu&s;y in
carrying back|wards and forwards whatever it can find in its cage. One
&s;olitary male of this &s;pecies is &s;uf|ficient to di&s;turb a whole volery
of Canaries; it teazes the females while they are &s;itting, fights with their
males, tears away the ne&s;ts, and breaks the eggs. We &s;hould hardly conceive
that birds &s;o lively and petulant could be &s;o gentle and even &s;o docile.
They live in harmony with each other, &s;eek each other's &s;ociety, give marks
of regard at all &s;ea&s;ons, and &s;eldom quarrel but about their food. They
are not &s;o peaceful with other birds; they beat the Canaries and Linnets,
but, in their turn, they receive the &s;ame treatment from the Titmou&s;e. They
have a &s;ingular in&s;tinct of always chu&s;ing to &s;leep in the highe&s;t
part of the volery; and we may naturally &s;uppo&s;e a ground of quarrel will
be afforded, when the other birds will not give place to them.</P>
<P>The docility of the Goldfinches is well known: they can be
in&s;tructed without much trouble to perform &s;everal movements with accuracy,
to fire a cracker, and to draw up &s;mall cups con|taining their food and
drink; but for this la&s;t purpo&s;e they mu&s;t be <HI>clothed.</HI> This
clothing con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;mall belt of &s;oft leather two lines broad, with
four holes through which the feet and wings are pa&s;&s;ed, and the ends
joining un|der <PB N="168" REF="191"> the belly, are held by a ring which
&s;upports the chain of the cup. In &s;olitude it delights to view its image in
the mirror, fancying it &s;ees another of its own &s;pecies; and this
attachment to &s;ociety &s;eems to equal the cravings of nature; for often it
is ob&s;erved to pick up the hemp &s;eed, grain by grain, and advance to eat at
the mirror, imagining, no doubt, that it feeds in company.</P>
<P>To &s;ucceed in breeding Goldfinches, they ought to be
&s;eparated and rai&s;ed &s;ingly, or at lea&s;t each with the female with
which it is in|tended to be paired.</P>
<P>The younger Madame Daubenton educated a whole hatch; the young
Goldfinches became tame at a certain age, and afterwards relap&s;ed into the
&s;ame &s;avage &s;tate in which they would be found if bred by their parents
in the field: they renounce the refinements of man to enjoy the &s;ociety of
their fellows.&mdash;But this is not the only inconvenience of training them
together; they acquire an affection for each other, and when &s;eparated, to
pair with a female Canary, they are languid in their amours, are affected by
the tender remembrance of former friendships, and commonly die of
melancholy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of five Goldfinches bred in the volery of
this lady, and paired with hen Canaries, three remained inactive: the other two
copu|lated, but broke the eggs, and died &s;oon afterwards.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="192"> The Goldfinches begin to a&s;&s;emble in
au|tumn, and during that &s;ea&s;on they are caught among the birds of
pa&s;&s;age which pillage our gardens. Their natural vivacity precipitates them
into the &s;nares; but, to &s;ucceed well, it is nece&s;&s;ary to have a male
that has been ac|cu&s;tomed to &s;ing. They are not caught by calls; and they
elude the bird of prey by taking &s;hel|ter among the bu&s;hes. In winter they
fly in numerous flocks, &s;o that &s;even or eight may be killed at a &s;hot;
they approach the highways near which are thi&s;tles and wild &s;uccory; they
&s;hake off the &s;now to obtain the &s;eeds and the caterpillars. In Provence

<P>All tho&s;e who have mentioned this bird give it the
appellation of American Goldfinch; yet this term would not be proper till it
was a&s;cer|tained that no other Goldfinch exi&s;ted in the 
<PB N="180" REF="203"> New World, and this &s;uppo&s;ition is not only
improbable, but ab&s;olutely fal&s;e, for that of the preceding article is a
native of Brazil; I have therefore adopted another denomination, which
characterizes its plumage. The bill is nearly of the &s;ame &s;hape and colour
as the Common Goldfinch; the forehead black, which is pecu|liar to the male;
the re&s;t of the head, the neck, the back, and the brea&s;t, &s;hining yellow;
the thighs, the lower belly, the &s;uperior and in|ferior coverts of the tail,
yellowi&s;h-white; the &s;mall coverts of the wings yellow on the out&s;ide,
whiti&s;h on the in&s;ide, and tipt with white; the great coverts black, and
terminated with white &s;lightly &s;haded with brown, which form two
tran&s;ver&s;e rays that are very apparent on the black wings; the middle
quills of the&s;e are tipt with white; tho&s;e contiguous to the back and their
coverts are edged with yellow; the quills of the tail amount to twelve, are of
equal lengths, black above, and equal below; the lateral ones white on the
in&s;ide near the tip; the bill and legs fle&s;h-coloured.</P>
<P>In the female the forehead is not black, but of an
olive-green, and all the upper-part of the body is of the &s;ame colour; the
yellow of the rump, and of the under-part of the body, is le&s;s brilliant; the
black on the wings more dilute, and on the contrary the tran&s;ver&s;e rays are
not &s;o faint; la&s;tly, the belly, and the inferior co|verts of the tail, are
entirely white.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="204"> The young male is di&s;tingui&s;hed
from the fe|male by nothing but its black forehead.</P>
<P>The female ob&s;erved by Edwards was &s;hut up alone in a
cage, and yet layed in the month of Augu&s;t 1755, a &s;mall egg of pearl-gray,
and without &s;pots; but, what is more uncommon, Edwards adds, that it moulted
regularly twice a-year, in March and September. In winter the body was entirely
brown; but the head, wings, and tail, retained that colour only in &s;ummer.
The male died too &s;oon for this ob&s;ervation; but probably, like the female,
it would have dropt its feathers twice annually, and in that re&s;pect
re&s;emble the Bengals, the Widow-birds, and many other natives of warm
climates.</P>
<P>In the &s;ubject ob&s;erved by Bri&s;&s;on, the belly, the
loins, the inferior coverts of the tail, and of the wings, were of the &s;ame
yellow with the re&s;t of the body; the &s;uperior coverts of the tail
white|gray; the bill, the legs, and the nails, white: but mo&s;t of the&s;e
differences may be owing to the different &s;tates in which the bird has been
examined. Edwards drew it from the life, and his &s;pecimen appears be&s;ides
to have been larger than that of Bri&s;&s;on.</P>
<P>Cate&s;by tells us that it is very rare in Caro|lina, more

<P>I have &s;aid that it bears more analogy to the Si&s;kin than to
the Linnet; this was the opinion of Ge&s;ner, and it is al&s;o that of Dr.
Lottinger, who is well acquainted with the&s;e little birds. Fri&s;ch goes
farther, for he a&s;&s;erts that the Si&s;kin will &s;erve for a call to allure
the Le&s;&s;er Redpolls into &s;nares in the time of pa&s;&s;age, and that the
two &s;pecies intermix and propagate with each other. Aldrovandus perceived a
&s;trong likene&s;s between the Le&s;&s;er Redpoll and the Goldfinch, which,
except its red head, re&s;embles much a Si&s;kin. A bird-catcher of great
experience and little reading, told me that he has caught many of the
Le&s;&s;er Redpolls intermixed with Si&s;kins, which they were very like,
e&s;pecially the females, only their plumage was darker, and their bill
&s;horter. La&s;tly, Linnaeus &s;ays, that the Le&s;&s;er Redpolls fre|quent
places covered with alders, and Schwenck|feld reckons the &s;eeds of the&s;e
trees among the aliments which they prefer; but the Si&s;kins are extremely
fond of the&s;e &s;eeds. The Le&s;&s;er <PB N="185" REF="208"> Redpolls eat not
rape &s;eed like the Linnet, but hemp &s;eed, the &s;eed of &s;peckled nettles,
of thi&s;tles, of flax, of poppies, and crop the buds of young branches of oak,
&amp;c.: they mix readily with other birds: they are particularly tame in
winter, and will then allow us to approach very near them without being
&s;cared<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e remarks are Lottinger's. Schwenckfeld

and can ea&s;ily be caught with lime-twigs.</P>
<P>The Le&s;&s;er Redpoll frequents the woods, and often lodges in
the oaks: it creeps along the trunk like the Titmou&s;e, and al&s;o clings to
the extremity of the &s;mall branches. Hence pro|bably is derived the name of
<HI>Linaria Truncalis</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">i. e. Trunk

the granivo|rous tribe, and many pebbles are found in it.</P>
<P>In the male, the brea&s;t and the top of the head are red, and
there are two white tran&s;ver&s;e &s;tripes on the wings; the re&s;t of the

<P>OF all the granivorous birds, the Goldfinch is reckoned the
mo&s;t a-kin to the Si&s;kin; both have the bill elongated and &s;lender near
the point; both are gentle, docile, and lively. The fruits of their
intermixture are al&s;o fit to propa|gate.&mdash;Some naturali&s;ts have been
induced by the&s;e analogies, to regard them as two contigu|ous &s;pecies
belonging to the &s;ame genus: indeed all the granivorous birds may be
cla&s;&s;ed together; for their cro&s;s-breed are prolific. Since this general
character extends to them all, it becomes the more nece&s;&s;ary to &s;elect
the di&s;tingui&s;hing features, and to trace the preci&s;e boundaries of each
&s;pecies.</P>
<P>The Si&s;kin is &s;maller than the Goldfinch; its bill is
proportionally &s;horter, and its plumage is <PB N="189" REF="212"> entirely
different: its head is not red, but black; its throat brown; the fore-part of
its neck, its brea&s;t, and the lateral quills of its tail, yellow; the belly
yellowi&s;h white; the under-part of the body olive-green, &s;peckled with
black, which a&s;&s;umes a yellow ca&s;t on the rump, and &s;till more yellow
on the &s;uperior coverts of the tail.</P>
<P>But in the more intimate qualities, which re&s;ult directly from
organization or in&s;tinct, the differences are &s;till greater. The Si&s;kin
has a &s;ong peculiar to it&s;elf, and much inferior to that of the Goldfinch;
it is very fond of alder-&s;eeds, which the Goldfinch will never touch, and the
Si&s;kin, in its turn, is indifferent about thi&s;tle|&s;eeds: it creeps along
the branches, and &s;u&s;pends it&s;elf from their extremity like the
Titmou&s;e:&mdash;In &s;hort, we might regard it as an intermediate &s;pecies
to the Titmou&s;e and Goldfinch. Be&s;ides, it is a bird of pa&s;&s;age, and in
its migrations it flies at a great height, and is heard before it can be
&s;een; whereas the Goldfinch continues with us the whole year, and never flies
very high: la&s;tly, the&s;e two birds are never ob&s;erved to a&s;|&s;ociate
together.</P>
<P>The Si&s;kin can be taught like the Goldfinch, to draw up the
little bucket: it is equally docile, and though not &s;o active, it is more
cheerful; for it begins always the earlie&s;t in the morning to warble, and to
rouze the other birds. But, as it has an un&s;u&s;picious temper, it is
ea&s;ily de|coyed into all &s;orts of &s;nares, traps, &s;prings, &amp;c. 
<PB N="190" REF="213"> and it is more ea&s;ily trained than any other bird
caught in the adult &s;tate. We need only to offer it habitually the proper
&s;ort of food in the hand, and it will &s;oon become as tame as the mo&s;t
familiar Canary. We may even accu&s;tom it to perch upon the hand at the
&s;ound of a bell; for if at fir&s;t we ring at each meal, the &s;ubtle
a&s;&s;ociation of perceptions, which obtains al&s;o among the animals, will
afterwards rouze it to the call. Though the Si&s;kin appears to &s;elect its
food with care, it con&s;umes much; but its voracious appetite is &s;ubordinate
to a noble pa&s;|&s;ion: it has always in the volery &s;ome favourite of its
own &s;pecies, or if that is not to be ob|tained, a bird of another &s;pecies,
which it che|ri&s;hes and feeds with the fondne&s;s of a parent.&mdash;It
drinks often<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The bird-catchers lay lime-twigs at the
&s;ides of brooks, and are very &s;ucce&s;sful in the capture.</NOTE>, but
&s;eldom bathes; it only approaches the margin of the water and dips its bill
and brea&s;t, without much fluttering, except perhaps in hot weather.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid that it breeds on the i&s;lands in the Rhine, in
Franche-comt&eacute;, in Switzerland, Greece, and Hungary, and that it prefers
the mountain fore&s;ts. Its ne&s;t is very difficult to di&s;cover<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"> 
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"The bird-catchers in Orleans, &s;ays
Salerne, agree that the di&s;covery of a Si&s;kin's ne&s;t is a thing quite
unheard of. It is probable, however, that &s;ome continue in the country, and
breed near the banks of the Loiret, among the alders, of which they are very
fond; and the more &s;o as young ones are &s;ome|times caught with limed twigs
or in traps. M. Colombeau a&s;&s;ures me, that he found a ne&s;t with five eggs
in the bleachfield of M. Hery de la Salle."</Q> Kramer tells us, that in the
fore&s;ts &s;kirted by the Danube, thou&s;ands of young Si&s;kins are found,
which have not dropt their fir&s;t feathers, and yet it is very rare to meet
with a ne&s;t. One day when he was botanizing with one of his friends about the
15th of June, they both &s;aw a male and female Si&s;kin often fly towards an
alder with food in their bills; but, though they &s;earched with all
po&s;&s;ible care, they could neither hear nor &s;ee the young
ones.</P></NOTE>, <PB N="191" REF="214"> which has given ri&s;e to a vulgar
opinion, that the Si&s;kin renders it invi&s;ible with a certain &s;tone.
Accordingly, our accounts are imperfect in regard to that &s;ubject: Fri&s;ch
&s;ays that it conceals its ne&s;t in holes; Kramer &s;uppo&s;es the bird
covers it with leaves, which is the rea&s;on that it is never found.&mdash;The
be&s;t way to a&s;certain the point, would be to ob&s;erve how they proceed
when they breed in a volery; which, though the trial has not hitherto
&s;ucceeded, is &s;till po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>But it is more common to cro&s;s them with the Canaries. There
&s;eems to be a great &s;ympa|thy between the two &s;pecies; they &s;hew a
reci|procal fondne&s;s at the very fir&s;t meeting, and intermix
indi&s;criminately<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Father Bougot, from whom I received
the&s;e remarks, has for five years &s;een a hen Canary breed thrice annually
with the &s;ame cock Canary, and the four following years twice annually with
another Canary, the fir&s;t having died.</NOTE>. When a Si&s;kin is paired with
a hen Canary, he eagerly &s;hares her toils; he is bu&s;y in carying materials
for the ne&s;t, and arranging them; and regularly di&s;gorges food for the
&s;itting female. But yet mo&s;t of the eggs are addle: for the union of hearts
is not alone &s;ufficient in generation, and the tem|perament 
<PB N="192" REF="215"> of the Si&s;kin wants much of the warmth of the
Canary.&mdash;The Hybrids re&s;emble both parents.</P>
<P>In Germany, the Si&s;kins begin to migrate in October, or even
earlier; at this time they eat the hop &s;eeds, to the great injury of the
proprietors, and the places where they halt are &s;trewed with leaves. They
entirely di&s;appear in December, and return in February<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Fri&s;ch.</BIBL></NOTE>. In Burgundy, they arrive at the

<P>In Provence, they leave the woods and de|&s;cend from the

</LIST></HEAD>
<P>IN the warm parts of America is found a very numerous genus of
birds, &s;ome of which are called <HI>Tangaras</HI> at Brazil; and
nomencla|tors have adopted this name for all the &s;pecies included. The&s;e
birds have been &s;uppo&s;ed by mo&s;t travellers to be a kind of Sparrows; in
fact, they differ from the European Sparrows only by their colours, and by a
minute character, that the upper mandible is &s;colloped on both &s;ides near
the point. They clo&s;ely re&s;emble the Sparrows in their in&s;tinctive
habits: they fly low and by jerks; their notes are for the mo&s;t part har&s;h;
they may be al&s;o reckoned granivorous, for they live upon very &s;mall
fruits; they are &s;ocial with each other, and, like the Sparrows, are &s;o
familiar as to vi&s;it the dwellings: they &s;ettle in dry grounds, and never
in mar&s;hes; they lay two eggs, and &s;ometimes, though rarely, three.</P>
<P>The Sparrows of Cayenne have &s;eldom more eggs, while tho&s;e
of Europe have five or &s;ix; and this difference is perceived in general
be|tween birds of hot and tho&s;e of temperate cli|mates. The &s;malne&s;s of
the hatch is compen|&s;ated <PB N="202" REF="225"> by its frequent repetition,
love being che|ri&s;hed and maintained by the continual and uni|form
warmth.</P>
<P>The whole genus of Tanagres, of which we know more than thirty
&s;pecies, exclu&s;ive of va|rieties, &s;eems confined to the new continent;
for all tho&s;e which we have received were brought from Guiana and other
countries of America, and not from Africa or India. This multitude of &s;pecies
is not &s;urpri&s;ing; for, in general, the number of birds in the torrid zone
is perhaps ten times greater than in other regions, becau&s;e nature is there
more prolific, and le&s;s di&s;turbed in her operations by the interference of
man; becau&s;e fore&s;ts are there more frequent, &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence is more
plentiful, and the colds of win|ter are unknown; and the natives of the
tro|pical countries, rioting in a perpetual abundance, are totally exempted
from the ri&s;ks and dangers of a migration, and &s;eldom are obliged even to
&s;hift from one haunt to another.</P>
<P>To avoid confu&s;ion, we &s;hall range the thirty &s;pecies of
Tanagres into three divi&s;ions, adopting the characters from the mo&s;t
obvious difference, that of &s;ize.</P>

Fourthly, and la&s;tly, The Brazilian Black-bird of Belon, which received that
name from tho&s;e who fir&s;t imported it into France. Aldro|vandus has copied
Belon. The de&s;criptions coin|cide in every re&s;pect, except in the &s;ongs
of the&s;e birds; and I ob&s;erved that tho&s;e which chanted were larger, had
a brighter red tinge on the plumage, and al&s;o on the &s;uperior coverts of
the wings, &amp;c. which makes it very probable that they were the males;
indeed in almo&s;t all kinds of birds it is the males that are mu&s;ical.</P>
<P>It would al&s;o appear, that in the male the feathers on the
head are longer, and form a &s;ort of cre&s;t, as Edwards has figured it. This
has led &s;ome travellers to &s;ay that there are two kinds of Cardinals in
Mexico; one cre&s;ted, which &s;ings agreeably, and the other &s;maller, which
&s;ings not at all.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds belong to the warm climates of Mexico, Peru, and
Brazil; but are rare in Gui|ana. Belon tells us that in his time the mer|chants
who traded to Brazil drew con&s;iderable <PB N="207" REF="231"> profit from the
importation of them. Probably the feathers were employed to ornament the robes
and other dre&s;&s;es then in fa&s;hion, and the&s;e birds were more numerous
than at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>We may pre&s;ume that when travellers talk of the warble of
the Cardinal, they mean the Scar|let Tanagre; for the <HI>Cre&s;ted
Cardinal</HI> is of the genus of the Gro&s;beaks, and con&s;equently a &s;ilent
bird. With regard to this point Salerne contradicts him&s;elf in the &s;ame
page. It is uni|ver&s;ally admitted that this Tanagre has an agree|able warble,
and is &s;u&s;ceptible even of in&s;truc|tion. Fernandez relates that it is
found parti|cularly at Totonocapa in Mexico, and &s;ings delightfully.</P>
<P>We reckon the following varieties of this
&s;pecies:&mdash;</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>The Spotted Cardinal</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cardinalis Naevius,</HI> Bri&s;&s;.</NOTE>, mentioned by
Bri&s;&s;on, which differs from the Scarlet Tanagre only becau&s;e &s;ome
feathers of its back and brea&s;t are edged with green, which forms &s;pots of
the &s;ame colour, and of a cre&s;cent &s;hape. Aldro|vandus calls this <HI>The
Short-tailed Blackbird.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>The Collared Cardinal</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cardinalis Torquatus,</HI> Bri&s;&s;.</NOTE>, mentioned by
Bri&s;&s;on. It has not only the &s;ame &s;ize and colours as the Scarlet
Tanagre, but the &s;mall coverts, and the edges of the quills of the wings are
blue, and on each &s;ide of the neck are two great &s;pots of the &s;ame
colour, they are conti|guous, <PB N="208" REF="232"> and &s;haped like a
cre&s;cent. But Bri&s;&s;on copies his de&s;criptions of the Collared and
Spot|ted Cardinal from Aldrovandus, who &s;aw only the figures of the&s;e two
birds, which renders their very exi&s;tence doubtful. Indeed I &s;hould not
have taken notice of them, did not the no|menclators in&s;ert them in their
catalogues.</P>
<P>Thirdly, The Mexican bird which Hernan|dez calls <HI>The
Parrot-coloured Mexican bird,</HI> and which Bri&s;&s;on de&s;cribes under the
name of <HI>Mexican Cardinal.</HI> Hernandez &s;ays only, 
<Q REND="inline">"This bird, from the lower part of the bill

greeni&s;h tinge that gradually increa&s;es from thence to the neck, which is
quite green. The head has an amethy&s;tine or hya|cinthine tinge. The circle
which &s;urrounds the pupil is very white, and the orbits of a deep coerulean.
The origin of the wings is yellowi&s;h; their quills hyacinthine, and marked

<P>This is a new &s;pecies. It re&s;embles much the Canada
Tanagre, only its wings and tail are not black, but of the &s;ame colour with
the re&s;t of the body. Its bill is larger and thicker than in any of the
Tanagres; and al&s;o the mandibles are convex and inflated, which is uncommon
even in any kind of the birds.&mdash;This character is badly expre&s;&s;ed in
the <HI>Planches Enlumin&eacute;es.</HI></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Twelfth Species.</HEAD>
<P>The French &s;ettlers in Cayenne have given this bird the name
of <HI>Silver-Bill (Bec-d' Argent),</HI> which expre&s;&s;es a remarkable
&s;pecific character; viz. that the ba&s;e of the lower mandible ex|tends under
the eyes, and forms on each &s;ide a thick plate, which, when the bird is
alive, looks like the brighte&s;t &s;ilver; but this lu&s;tre tarni&s;hes after
death. It is imperfectly repre&s;ented in the <HI>Planches
Enlumin&eacute;es.</HI> Edwards has given an ex|cellent figure of this bird
under the name of <HI>Red-brea&s;ted Black-bird;</HI> he is deceived indeed in
regard to the genus, but he has hit the di&s;|criminating features.</P>
<P>The total length is &s;ix inches and a half, and that of the
bill nine lines, which is black on the <PB N="216" REF="240"> upper-part; the
head, throat, and brea&s;t, are purple, and the re&s;t of the body black, with
&s;ome purple tints. The iris is brown. The fe|male differs from the male, not
only in the colour of its bill, but in tho&s;e of its plumage; the upper-part
of its body is brown, with &s;ome &s;hades of ob&s;cure purple, and the
under-part reddi&s;h; the tail and wings are brown.</P>
<P>Another di&s;criminating character of the male, is a &s;ort of
half collar round the occiput, formed by long purple bri&s;tles, which project
near three lines beyond the feathers. We are indebted to Sonini for this
remark; and al&s;o for our ac|quaintance with this and all the other Tanagres
of Guiana.</P>
<P>This bird is more numerous than any of the Tanagres in the
I&s;land of Cayenne and in Guiana; and it probably occurs in many other warm
countries of America, for Fernandez gives the &s;ame account of a Mexican bird
that fre|quents the vicinity of the mountains of Tepuz|cullula. It feeds upon
&s;mall fruits, and al&s;o upon the large pulpy produce of the bananas, &amp;c.
when they are ripe; but eats no in&s;ects. It haunts the cleare&s;t &s;pots,
and does not &s;hun the neighbourhood of dwellings, and even vi&s;its the
gardens. However, the Red-brea&s;ted Tana|gres are al&s;o very common in
de&s;ert tracts, and even in the glades of the fore&s;ts; for in &s;pots where
the trees are levelled by the hurricanes, and where the &s;un darts his burning
rays, there <PB N="217" REF="241"> are generally &s;ome of the&s;e birds,
though al|ways in pairs, and never in flocks.</P>
<P>Their ne&s;t is cylindrical, and &s;omewhat curved, which they
fa&s;ten horizontally between the branches, the entrance being below; &s;o that
the rain, from whatever direction it beats, can|not penetrate. It is &s;ix
inches long, and four inches and a half in diameter; it is con&s;tructed with
&s;traws and the dry leaves of the Indian flowering reed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Canna Indica,</HI> Linn.</NOTE>, and the bottom is well lined
with broader portions of the &s;ame leaves:&mdash;it is generally fixed in the
loftie&s;t trees. The female lays two elliptical eggs, which are white, and
covered at the thick end with &s;mall &s;pots of light red, which melts away as
it approaches the other end.</P>
<P>Some nomenclators have given this bird the name of Cardinal,
but improperly: others have &s;uppo&s;ed that there is an obvious variety in
this &s;pecies. In Mauduit's cabinet we &s;aw a bird who&s;e plumage is pale
ro&s;e-colour, variegated with gray; I am rather inclined to think, that this
difference is occa&s;ioned by moulting.<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific

the upper-parts of the neck and back, on the middle quills of the wings, and on

the under-part of the body from the brea&s;t. The&s;e colours are all
exceed|ingly bright, and well defined.</P>
<P>It does not a&s;&s;ume the vivid red on the back till grown
up, and the female never has that co|lour; the lower-part of her back too is
orange like the rump, and in general her tints are more dilute, and not &s;o
di&s;tinctly de&s;ined as tho&s;e of the male&mdash;But there is &s;till &s;ome
diver&s;ity in the di&s;po&s;ition of the colours; &s;ome males have the bright
red on the rump as well as on the back; and in many others both the back and
rump are entirely of a gold colour.</P>
<P>The male and female are nearly of the &s;ame &s;ize, being
five inches long; the bill only &s;ix lines, and the legs eight lines; the tail
is &s;ome|what forked, and the wings reach to the middle of it.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds appear in numerous flocks. They feed upon the
tender half-formed fruits which grow on a certain large tree in Guiana. They
arrive in the i&s;land of Cayenne when this tree is in blo&s;&s;om, and depart
&s;oon afterwards, pene|trating probably into the interior parts of the country
when the &s;ame fruits are later in com|ing to maturity. They make their
appearance in <PB N="230" REF="255"> the inhabited parts of Guiana commonly
about the middle of September, and &s;tay about &s;ix weeks; they return again
in April or May. Indeed they &s;eem to &s;eek always the &s;ame food; and when
any of tho&s;e trees is in blow, we may certainly expect to find a number of
the&s;e birds.</P>
<P>They breed not during their re&s;idence in Gui|ana. Marcgrave
tells us that in Brazil they are kept in the cage, and fed on meal and bread.
They have no warble, and their cry is &s;hort and &s;harp.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t not with Bri&s;&s;on range the <HI>Talao</HI> with

<P>Such is the name this little bird receives at St. Domingo;
becau&s;e it &s;ounds all the notes of the octave, ri&s;ing from the ba&s;e to
the treble. This &s;ort of &s;ong, which implies that the ear of this bird is
organized &s;imilarly to the human ear, is not only &s;ingular, but very
plea&s;ant. The Chevalier Fabre De&s;hayes has informed me in a letter, that in
the &s;outh of St. Domingo on the high mountains, there is a &s;mall bird very
rare and famous, called the <HI>Mu&s;ician,</HI> who&s;e &s;ong can be written.
We pre&s;ume that this is the &s;ame with the <HI>Organi&s;t.</HI> But &s;till
we &s;hould doubt of the regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of mu&s;ical &s;ounds; for we
had not the bird alive. It was pre&s;ented by the Count de No&euml;, who had
brought it from the Spani&s;h di&s;trict of St. Domingo, where he told me it
was very rare, and difficult to di&s;cover, or to &s;hoot; becau&s;e it is
&s;hy, and artfully con|ceals it&s;elf; it even turns round the branch as the
hunter changes place, to elude his view: &s;o that though there be &s;everal of
the&s;e birds on a tree, it often happens that not one of them can be
perceived.</P>
<P>The length four inches; the plumage blue on the head and neck;
the back, the wings, and the tail, are &s;tained with black, running 
<PB N="236" REF="262"> into coar&s;e blue; the forehead, the rump, and all the
upper-part of the body, coloured with orange-colour.&mdash;This &s;hort
de&s;cription is &s;uffi|cient to di&s;criminate it.</P>
<P>We find in Dupratz's Hi&s;tory of Loui&s;iana, the
de&s;cription of a &s;mall bird which he calls <HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI> and which we
believe to be the &s;ame with the <HI>Organi&s;t.</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"The Bi&s;hop is a bird &s;maller than the
Canary; its plumage is blue, verging on violet.&mdash;It feeds on many &s;orts
of &s;mall &s;eeds, among the&s;e <HI>widlogouil</HI> and
<HI>choupi|choul,</HI> a kind of millet peculiar to the country. Its notes are
&s;o flexible, its warble &s;o tender, that when we once hear it, we become
more re&s;erved in our eulogiums on this nightingale. Its &s;ong la&s;ts during
a <HI>Mi&s;erere,</HI> and during the whole time it never makes an
in&s;piration; it re&s;ts twice as long before it renews its mu&s;ic, the whole
interval elap&s;ed being about two hours."</Q></P>
<P>Though Dupratz does not mention whether it gives the notes of
the octaves as the Organi&s;t is &s;aid to do, we cannot doubt their identity;
for the colours and &s;ize are the &s;ame in both. The Scarlet Tanagre, which
re&s;embles it in point of &s;ong, is twice as large; and the Arada, which has
al&s;o a charming warble, is entirely brown. The Organi&s;t is then the only
bird to which it can be referred.</P>

<P>This bird was called <HI>Jacarini</HI> by the Brazilians.
Marcgrave mentions it, but takes no notice of its habits. However, Sonini de
Manoncour, who ob&s;erved it in Guiana, where it is very common, informs us
that it prefers the cleared grounds, and is never &s;een in the large
fore&s;ts; that it lodges in the low trees, particularly the coffee|tree, and
is di&s;tingui&s;hed by a &s;ingular circum|&s;tance, viz. that it &s;prings
from the branch on which it has perched a foot, or a foot and a half
vertically, and falls back to the &s;ame &s;pot; and thus continues to ri&s;e
and &s;ink alternately, till it removes to another bu&s;h, where it repeats the
&s;ame exerci&s;e. Each leap is attended with a &s;eeble cry, expre&s;&s;ive of
plea&s;ure, and by an ex|pan&s;ion of the tail. This would &s;eem to be the
mode in which the male courts the female; which on the contrary remains at
ea&s;e, or hops about like other birds. The ne&s;t is compo&s;ed of dry herbs
of a gray colour; it is hemi&s;pheri|cal, and two inches in diameter; the
female depo&s;its in it two elliptical eggs, &s;even or eight lines long, and
of a greeni&s;h white, &s;prinkled <PB N="238" REF="264"> with &s;mall red
&s;pots, which are numerous, and &s;pread mo&s;t profu&s;ely near the big

and &s;hining like poli&s;hed &s;teel, and uniform over the whole body, except
only in the male the interior coverts of the wings, which are whiti&s;h; for

with yellow, and partly with olive-yellow: whereas in the male the body is of a
deep blue; and the forehead, the under-part of the throat and belly, fine

<P>In the young bird the colours are &s;omewhat different. The

it is not of &s;o clo&s;e a texture, and is compo&s;ed of reddi&s;h herbs

Lyons, who has &s;ometimes above an hundred Ortolans in his volery, and who
com|municated to me, or confirmed, many peculiarities of their

mor&s;el<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">It is pretended tho&s;e caught in the
plains of Toulou&s;e are better flavoured than tho&s;e of Italy. In winter they
are very &s;carce, and con&s;equently very dear: they are di&s;patched to Paris

&s;ent from Bologna and Florence to Rome in boxes full of corn, ac|cording to
Aldrovandus.</NOTE>. The Ortolans are not always caught fat; but there is an
in|fallible method to bring them into that &s;tate. They are &s;hut up in a
room from which the ex|ternal light is excluded, but which is con&s;tantly
illuminated with lanthorns, &s;o that they cannot di&s;tingui&s;h the night
from the day: they are allowed to run about and pick up the oats and millet
that are regularly &s;cattered in the apart|ment. With this regimen they &s;oon
grow exce&s;&s;ively fat, and if not prevented would even die of extreme
corpulence<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">It has been &s;aid that they are

<P>The fat Ortolans are ea&s;ily dre&s;&s;ed in the water-bath, the
&s;and-bath, in hot a&s;hes, &amp;c. And they may be al&s;o very well prepared
in the &s;hell of a real or an artificial egg, as was for|merly practi&s;ed
with the beccafigos or epicurean warblers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Petronius.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>It cannot be denied that the delicacy of their fle&s;h, or
rather of their fat, has contributed more to their celebrity, than the charms
of their warble. However, when kept in the cage, they have a &s;ong like that
of the Yellow Bunting, which, as I have already ob&s;erved, they repeat night
and day. In countries where they are numerous, and con&s;equently well known,
as in Lombardy, they are not only fattened for the table, but trained to
&s;ing; and Salerne ob&s;erves that there is a &s;weetne&s;s in their notes. In
this ca&s;e they are better treated, and not being &s;uffered to grow
corpulent, their lives are prolonged. If they are kept a con&s;iderable time
be&s;ide other birds, they adopt &s;omething of their &s;ong, e&s;pecially when
they are young; but I know not whether they ever learn to articulate words, or
catch the notes of our mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds make their appearance at the &s;ame time with our
Swallow, or a little after, and they <PB N="248" REF="275"> either accompany or
precede the Quails. They enter Lower Provence, and advance as far as Burgundy,
e&s;pecially in the warm di&s;tricts, which are planted with vineyards;
however, they touch not the grapes, but eat the in&s;ects that prey upon the
leaves and tendrils of the vines. On their arrival, they are rather lean,
becau&s;e then is the &s;ea&s;on of their loves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They
may however be fatted at this time, by feeding them fir&s;t with oats, then
with hemp-&s;eed, with millet, &amp;c.</NOTE>. They build in the vines, and
their ne&s;ts are pretty regular, and &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the lark: they
lay four or five grayi&s;h eggs, and have commonly two hatches in the year. In
other countries, as in Lorraine, they place their ne&s;ts on the ground, and
prefer the corn-fields.</P>
<P>The young family begins to direct its cour&s;e to the &s;outhern
provinces as early as the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t; but the parents do not commence
their journey before the end of September. They remove into Fores, and halt in
the neighbour|hood of St. Chaumont and St. Etienne; they alight among the oats,
of which they are very fond, and remain till the cold weather be|gins to &s;et
in; during which time they become &s;o fat and inactive, that they might be
knocked down with &s;ticks. At this time they are proper for the table,
e&s;pecially the young ones; but they are more difficult to pre&s;erve than
tho&s;e which are caught in their fir&s;t entrance. In Bearn al&s;o, the
Ortolans appear twice annually; pa&s;&s;ing in May, and repa&s;&s;ing in

&s;till I ob&s;erve that they continue for a length of time in the &s;ame

characters; and that their in&s;tincts are not quite the &s;ame. I &s;hall
therefore follow the common divi&s;ion, but prote&s;t again&s;t the
multiplication of the number of &s;pecies, which is &s;o fertile a &s;ource of

ne&s;tle among the ru&s;hes; however, they &s;ometimes re&s;ort to the high

roads, and in Augu&s;t they feed in the corn fields. Kra|mer tells us that they
are fonde&s;t of millet. In general they &s;eek their food like the Buntings,
along the hedges, and in the cultivated &s;pots. They keep near the ground, and
&s;eldom perch except on the bu&s;hes. They never a&s;&s;emble in flocks, and

<P>THESE birds are migratory birds, and the motive of their
pa&s;&s;age is not known. Numerous flocks of them are &s;een or rather heard in
the month of September, coming from the I&s;land of Cuba, where the rice has
already at|tained maturity, and directing their cour&s;e to Ca|rolina, where it
is only coming into ear. The&s;e remain in Carolina only three weeks, and then
advance towards the north, always in &s;earch of more tender grain: and, by
&s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;tations, they penetrate as far as Canada, and perhaps
beyond. But what is the mo&s;t &s;ingular, though there are other &s;imilar
in&s;tances, the&s;e flocks are compo&s;ed entirely of females. It is
a&s;certained, we are told, from numerous diffections, that only the females
pa&s;s in September; but in the beginning of the &s;pring, the males and
females are intermingled; and indeed, this is the &s;ea&s;on of the union of
the &s;exes.</P>
<P>The plumage of the females is ru&s;ty over al|mo&s;t its whole
body; that of the males is more <PB N="271" REF="302"> diver&s;ified: the
fore-part of the head and neck, the throat, the brea&s;t, and all the
under-part of the body, the upper-part of the back and the thighs, black, with
a mixture of ru&s;ty; the back of the head and neck ru&s;ty; the lower-part of
the back and rump of an olive cinereous; the great &s;uperior coverts of the
wings of the &s;ame colour, edged with whiti&s;h; the &s;mall &s;uperior
coverts of the wings, and the &s;uperior coverts of the tail, dirty white; the
quills of the wing black, tipt with brown, and edged, the great ones with
&s;ulphur-colour, and the &s;mall ones with gray; the quills of the tail are
nearly like the great quills of the wings, only all terminate in points<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For this rea&s;on we have called the bird
<HI>Agripenne.</HI></NOTE>; la&s;tly, the bill is cinereous, and the legs
brown. This Ortolan is remarked to be taller than the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Total length &s;ix inches and three-fourths; the bill &s;ix
lines and a half; the alar extent four inches; the tail two inches and a half,
&s;omewhat forked, and exceeding the wings by ten lines.<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the Rice Bunting, <HI>Emberiza

<Q REND="inline">"Black, the neck tawny, the belly black, the

in Carolina before the end of la&s;t century, when that nutritious grain was
introduced from Madaga&s;car. We may &s;uppo&s;e that a few &s;tray birds had
been driven into that province by adver&s;e winds, and had fared &s;o well
among the rice-crops, as to have re|turned with their brood the en&s;uing
&s;ea&s;on: and thus, in the cour&s;e of a few years, a direction would be
given to their general mi|grations. They arrive in Carolina about September; at
fir&s;t they are very lean, but &s;oon grow exce&s;&s;ively fat, and fly with
difficulty, &s;o that they are ea&s;ily &s;hot. Their &s;tay la&s;ts three
weeks; and both &s;exes make a tran&s;ient vi&s;it in the &s;pring. A few
remain through the winter in Carolina, and even in Virginia, where they
&s;ub&s;i&s;t on the &s;cattered grains of Indian corn.</NOTE></P>

</FIGURE> <PB N="275" REF="307"> ground, below a clod, in a
bu&s;h, or in a tuft of gra&s;s, but always carele&s;sly. Sometimes it builds
in the low branches of &s;hrubs, and is then at more pains. The body of the
ne&s;t con&s;i&s;ts of &s;traws, mo&s;s, and dry leaves, and is lined with
roots, the fine&s;t &s;traws, hair, and wool. The eggs are generally four or
five, &s;potted with brown of different &s;hade, on a white ground; but the
&s;pots are thicker at the large end. The female covers with &s;uch ardent
attachment, that often &s;he can be caught by the hand in broad day. The young
are fed with &s;mall &s;eeds, in|&s;ects, and even May-flies; but of the&s;e

which had been thrown to the ground in its cage by &s;ome of the rabble, though
it did not appear much af|fected at the time, fell into convul&s;ions ever
after at the &s;ight of any mean looking fellow, and expired in one of the&s;e
fits eight months from the date of its fir&s;t accident.</P>
<P>The Bulfinches &s;pend the &s;ummer in the woods or on the
mountains: they make their ne&s;t in the bu&s;hes, five or &s;ix feet from the
ground, and &s;ometimes lower: this con&s;i&s;ts of mo&s;s, lined with &s;oft
materials; and its opening is &s;aid to be the lea&s;t expo&s;ed to the
prevailing wind. The female lays from four to &s;ix eggs <PB N="301" REF="335">
of a dirty white and a little blui&s;h, encircled near the large end with a
zone, formed by &s;pots of two colours, &s;ome of an ill-defined violet, others
of a di&s;tinct black. She di&s;gorges the food for the young like the
Goldfinches, the Linnets, &amp;c. The male is attentive to his mate, and
Linnaeus relates that he &s;ometimes holds out to her a &s;pider in his bill a
very long time. The young ones begin not to whi&s;tle till they are able to eat
without a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and then they &s;eem in&s;tinctively benevolent, if
what is related be true, that in a hatch of four, the three elder will feed
their puny brother. After the breeding is over, the parents &s;till continue
a&s;&s;ociated through the winter, for they are al|ways &s;een in pairs:
tho&s;e which remain in the country, leave the fore&s;ts, and de&s;cend from

<P>Some reckon the&s;e birds attentive and thought|ful; and their
heavy air and the facility with which they are in&s;tructed &s;eem to favour
that idea; but, on the other hand, their allowing one to get near them, and
their being decoyed into the different &s;nares<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ge&s;ner caught many of them during the winter, by a bait of
night-&s;hade berries.</NOTE>, indicate want of cir|cum&s;pection. As their
&s;kin is very tender, tho&s;e which are caught with bird-lime lo&s;e, in
&s;trug|gling to e&s;cape, part of their down, and even of their quills,
unle&s;s a per&s;on &s;peedily di&s;entan|gles them. It de&s;erves to be
remarked, that tho&s;e which have the fine&s;t plumage are the lea&s;t capable
of in&s;truction, being older and not &s;o tractable: but even the old ones are
&s;oon recon|ciled to the cage, provided that at fir&s;t they have plenty of
food; they can al&s;o be properly tamed, as I have already noticed, though to
&s;ucceed re|quires time and patient attention, which is the rea&s;on that
per&s;ons &s;ometimes fail in the attempt. It &s;eldom happens that one is
caught alone; the <PB N="303" REF="337"> other is &s;oon enticed to follow its
compa|nion, and &s;acri&s;ices its freedom to the calls of friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>It has been afferted that the Canary, which breeds with &s;o
many other &s;pecies, will never &s;ubmit to the embrace of the Bulfinch, and
it is alleged as the rea&s;on, that the cock Bul|finch, when in heat, holds his
bill open, which frightens the Canary. But the Marquis de Piolenc a&s;&s;ures
me, that he &s;aw a Bulfinch pair with a hen Canary, which had five young ones
about the beginning of April: their bill was larger than that of Canaries of
the &s;ame age, and they began to be covered with a blacki&s;h down, which
&s;eemed to &s;hew that they had more of the father than the mother:
unfortu|nately they all died in performing a &s;hort jour|ney. What adds more
weight to this ob&s;erva|tion, Fri&s;ch gives directions for the experiment: he
advi&s;es that the cock Bulfinch be the &s;malle&s;t of its kind, and be kept
long in the &s;ame volery with the hen Canary: he &s;ubjoins, that &s;ome|times
a whole year elap&s;es before the female will allow the Bulfinch to come near,
or to eat out of the &s;ame tray; which &s;hews that the union is difficult but
not impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved that the Bulfinches jerk their tail
bri&s;kly upwards and downwards, though not in &s;o remarkable a degree as the
Wagtails. They live five or &s;ix years; their fle&s;h is palat|able according
to &s;ome, and not fit to be caten <PB N="304" REF="338"> according to others,

ounce. The upper-part of the head, the ring round the bill, and the origin of
the neck, are fine glo&s;&s;y black, which extends more or le&s;s forwards and
backwards<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hence the name of Monk, or Pope, which this

the top of the belly, beautiful red; the abdomen, and the inferior coverts of

&s;houlders, cinereous; the rump white, the &s;uperior coverts and the quills

coverts of the wings of a fine changing black, terminated with reddi&s;h
light-gray; the middle ones cinereous; the &s;mall ones, blacki&s;h
a&s;h-colour, edged with reddi&s;h; the iris hazel; the bill blacki&s;h, and
the legs brown.</P>
<P>The &s;ides of the head and the fore-part of the neck, the
brea&s;t, the top of the belly, and in a word, almo&s;t all that was red in the
male, is vinous a&s;h-colour in the female, and &s;ome|times even the abdomen:
nor has it the fine glo&s;&s;y changing black that occurs on the head 
<PB N="305" REF="339"> and other parts of the male. I have &s;een a fe|male
however, which had the la&s;t of the wing-quills edged with red, and which had
no white on the outermo&s;t of tho&s;e of the tail. Linnaeus adds, that the tip
of the tongue is divided into &s;mall filaments; but I have always found it
quite entire in the male, and &s;haped like a very &s;hort tooth-pick.</P>
<P>In many young Bulfinches which I have ob&s;erved about the end
of June, the fore-head was light rufous, the fore-part of the neck and brea&s;t
ru&s;ty-brown; the belly and the inferior coverts of the tail fulvous, which
extends and grows more dilute on the &s;ide; the under-part of the body, more
or le&s;s du&s;ky; the white ray over the wing deeply tinged with ru&s;ty; the
rump white of different &s;hades.&mdash;But it is ob|vious that con&s;iderable
diver&s;ities will occur.</P>

con&s;i&s;ting of twelve quills; the outer-toe joined by its fir&s;t
<HI>phalanx</HI> to the mid-toe; the hind-nail &s;tronger and more hooked than

<HEAD>VARIETIES of the BULFINCH.</HEAD>
<P>Sir Robert Sibbald has only a &s;ingle line on the Bulfinch, and
&s;ays, that there are &s;everal kinds of it in Scotland: the&s;e are probably
only the varieties which we &s;hall now de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>Fri&s;ch tells that the Bulfinches may be di|vided into three
different &s;izes: the Marquis de Piolenc was acquainted with two
di&s;tingui&s;hed by their bulk<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;malle&s;t, adds
M. de Piolenc, is of the &s;ize of the Chaf|finch, its body is longer, its
brea&s;t of a brighter red; and it &s;eems wilder than the ordinary
Bulfinch.</NOTE>: and others pretend that tho&s;e of Nivernois are &s;maller
than tho&s;e of Picardy. Lottinger a&s;&s;ures us, that the Bulfinch of the
mountains exceeds that of the plain; and this <PB N="307" REF="341"> accounts
for the diver&s;ity of bulk, being vari|ou&s;ly modified by local &s;ituation.
But the&s;e are too numerous to be &s;eparately treated: and I &s;hall here
take notice only of the varieties of plumage.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">

&s;peaks of a White Bulfinch that was caught near the village of Fri&s;chbach
in Sile&s;ia, and which had only &s;ome black feathers on the back. This fact
is confirmed by Deli&s;le: 
<Q REND="inline">"There are in this canton, (of Bere&s;ow in
Siberia,) &s;ays that excellent a&s;tronomer, White Bulfinches, who&s;e back is
&s;omewhat blacki&s;h, and gray in &s;ummer: the&s;e birds have a delicate
plea&s;ant &s;ong, much &s;uperior to that of European Bulfinches."</Q> It is

plumage.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<P>II. The BLACK BULFINCH<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Loxin-Pyrrhula,</HI> var. 1. Linn.</NOTE>. Under this
denomination, I include not only tho&s;e which are entirely or almo&s;t black,
but al&s;o tho&s;e which have perceptibly begun to a&s;&s;ume that
com|plexion:&mdash;&s;uch was what I &s;aw at Baron Goula's; its throat and
rump were black; the inferior coverts of its tail, its lower belly, and the top
of its brea&s;t, variegated with rufous wine-colour and black, and no white
&s;pots ap|peared <PB N="308" REF="342"> upon the la&s;t quill of the tail.
Tho&s;e mentioned by Ander&s;on and Salerne were en|tirely of a jet black; that
of Reaumur noticed by Bri&s;&s;on, was black over the whole body. I have
ob&s;erved one which a&s;&s;umed a fine glo&s;&s;y black after the fir&s;t
moulting, but which &s;till re|tained a little red on each &s;ide of the neck,
and a little gray behind the neck, and on the &s;mall &s;uperior coverts of the
wings; its legs were fle&s;h-coloured, and the in&s;ide of its bill red: that
of Albin had &s;ome red feathers under the belly; the five fir&s;t quills of
the wing edged with white; the iris white, and the legs fle&s;h-coloured<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. White, in his Natural Hi&s;tory of Selburne, relates al&s;o an
in&s;tance of a cock Bulfinch turning dingy, and afterwards black.</NOTE>.
Albin remarks that this bird was ex|ceedingly gentle, like all the Bulfinches.
It often happens that this robe of black di&s;appears in moulting, and gives
place to the natural colours: but often it renews each time, and re|mains for
&s;everal years:&mdash;&s;uch was the ca&s;e with Reaumur's. This would imply
that the change of colour is not the effect of di&s;ea&s;e.</P>

<P>Bri&s;&s;on mentions two American blue Bul|finches, of which
he makes two &s;eparate &s;pecies: but as they are both natives of the &s;ame
climate, are of the &s;ame &s;ize, of the &s;ame &s;hape nearly, and, except
the wings, tail, and bill, are of the &s;ame blue colour; I &s;hall con&s;ider
them as form|ing one &s;ingle &s;pecies, and regard the differences as
re&s;ulting from the influence of climate.</P>
<P>In both of them the prevailing colour is deep blue. The one
from South America has a &s;mall black &s;pot between the bill and the eye; the
quills of the tail, tho&s;e of the wings, and the great coverts of the&s;e, are
edged with blue; the bill is blacki&s;h, and the legs gray.</P>
<P>That of North America has at the ba&s;e of its bill a black
circular zone, which extending forms a junction between the eyes; the quills of
the tail and tho&s;e of the wings, and their great coverts, brown, tinged with
green; their middle coverts red, forming a tran&s;ver&s;e bar of the &s;ame
colour; the bill brown, and the legs black. The plumage of the female is
uniform, and of a deep brown, intermixed with a little blue.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the habits and oeconomy of the&s;e birds, we
can make no compari&s;on, &s;ince <PB N="316" REF="350"> we are unacquainted
with tho&s;e of the fir&s;t. Cate&s;by informs us in regard to the one from
Carolina, that it is very &s;olitary and rare; that it continues paired with
its female, and never appears in flocks; that it never winters in Caro|lina;
that its &s;ong is monotonous, and con&s;i&s;ts of a repetition of the &s;ame

<P>IT appears to us that this bird &s;hould be ranged between the
genus of the Widow and of the Bulfinch. Like the former, it has two long
feathers in the middle of its tail; and the latter it re&s;em|bles by the form
of its bill, which would be ex|actly that of the Bulfinch, were the lower
man|dible convex as the upper. But the tail of the Coly differs from that of
the Widow, becau&s;e it con&s;i&s;ts of tapered feathers, of which the two
la&s;t project only three or four inches beyond the re&s;t; whereas the
Widow-bird, be&s;ides the true tail, which is a bundle of feathers of equal
lengths attached to the rump, has appendices that in the different &s;pecies of
this genus con|tains two, four, and even &s;ix or eight feathers, extending to
double or triple the length of the true tail. In the Widow-birds too the webs
of the projecting feathers are equal on both &s;ides, and pretty long, and
taper imperceptibly from the origin to the extremity, except in the Domi|nican
and Shaft-tailed kinds; the former hav|ing its webs very &s;hort, and quickly
contracting towards the tips; the latter al&s;o very &s;hort, but which
uniformly lengthen and expand at the tips. In all the Colies, the feathers of
the tail, whether tho&s;e which properly belong to it, or tho&s;e which project
from it, have vanes that <PB N="322" REF="359"> continually dimini&s;h from the
in&s;ertion to the termination. Thus the real affinity between the tail of the
Widow-birds, and that of the Colies, con&s;i&s;ts in its length; and this
analogy is the clo&s;e&s;t in the ca&s;e of the Dominican Widow.</P>
<P>M. Mauduit has made two important ob&s;er|vations on this
&s;ubject. The fir&s;t is, that the long tails, the appendices, and other
ornaments of certain birds, are not peculiar additions, but only the greater
exten&s;ion of the parts common to all the feathered tribes. Thus long tails
con|&s;i&s;t in the augmented growth of the quills of the tail; and cre&s;ts
are derived from the enlargement of the feathers on the head. The mu&s;tachoes
of the Paradi&s;e bird appear to be only the produc|tion of the &s;lender
narrow plumules, which in all birds cover the <HI>meatus auditorius
externus</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>i. e.</HI> The external aperture of
the ear.</NOTE>. The exuberant growth of the axillary feathers give ri&s;e to
the long floating feathers which &s;hoot from under the wings in the Common
Paradi&s;e, and of tho&s;e which pre&s;ent the double wings in the King
Paradi&s;e. When the&s;e feathers lie flat, they &s;tretch towards the tail;
but when they are di&s;played they make angles with the axis of the body. They
differ from all other feathers, as their webs are equal on both &s;ides of the
&s;haft. They re&s;emble oars, and may &s;erve to direct the bird's motion. And
thus all the ornaments of plumage are derived from the mere exuberance or
production of parts u&s;ually le&s;s apparent.&mdash;<PB N="323" REF="360">The
&s;econd ob&s;ervation of M. Mauduit is, that the&s;e decorations are rare in
the cold and tempe|rate climates in both hemi&s;pheres, but are pretty frequent
in the hot countries, e&s;pecially in the old continent. Scarce any long-tailed
birds are found in Europe, except the Phea&s;ant, the Cock, which al&s;o is
often cre&s;ted, and has long floating feathers on the &s;ides; the Magpie, and
the long|tailed Titmou&s;e; and we have hardly any cre&s;t|ed birds but the
Eared Owls, the Lapwing, the Cre&s;ted Lark, and the Cre&s;ted Titmou&s;e. Some
water-birds indeed, &s;uch as the Ducks and He|rons, have frequently long
tails, or ornaments compo&s;ed of plumes, tufts, and feathers floating on the
rump.&mdash;The&s;e are all the birds which the frigid and temperate zones
afford, decorated with luxuriance of plumage. But in the torrid regions,
e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the old continent, the greate&s;t number of birds are
robed with &s;uch rich attire: we might in&s;tance the Colies, the Paradi&s;e
birds, the Kakatoes, the Widows, the Crowned Pigeons, the Hoopoes, the
Peacocks, which are all natives of the hot climates of A&s;ia, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Colies belong to the ancient continent, and are found in the
warm parts of A&s;ia and Africa, but never in America or Europe.</P>

<P>THESE birds are &s;mall and hand&s;ome; the large&s;t are not
equal in &s;ize to a Sparrow, and the others are inferior to that of the Wren.
The general characters are the&s;e: the bill is &s;hort, &s;trait, and
compre&s;&s;ed on the &s;ides near the tip; the upper-mandible is convex above,
and &s;lightly &s;callopped on the edges, rather longer than the
lower-mandible, which is plain and &s;traight.</P>
<P>In all the&s;e birds, the tail is &s;hort and &s;quare|cut, and
the toes have the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition as the Cock of the Rock, the Tody, and
the Calao, viz. the mid-toe is clo&s;ely connected to the outer-toe by a

being as large, compared with the Manakins, as the common hen contra&s;ted with
a Sparrow, there are many other obvious charac|ters which di&s;tingui&s;h them:
their bill is much &s;horter in proportion, they are generally not cre&s;ted,
and in tho&s;e which have a cre&s;t, it is not double, as in the Cock of the
Rock, but formed by &s;ingle feathers, &s;omewhat longer than the re&s;t. We
ought therefore to remove from the Manakins, not only the Horn-bills, but the
Cock of the Rock, and reckon them an inde|pendent genus.</P>
<P>The natural habits common to them all were not known, and the
ob&s;ervations which have been made are &s;till in&s;ufficient to admit an
exact detail. We &s;hall only relate the remarks com|municated to us by Sonini
of Manoncour, who &s;aw many of the&s;e birds in their native climates. They
inhabit the immen&s;e fore&s;ts in the warm parts of America, and never emerge
from their rece&s;&s;es to vi&s;it the cleared grounds or the vici|nity of the
plantations. They fly with con|&s;iderable &s;wiftne&s;s, but always at a
&s;mall height, <PB N="329" REF="367"> and to &s;hort di&s;tances; they never
perch on the &s;ummits of trees, but on the middle branches; they feed upon
&s;mall wild fruits, and al&s;o eat in&s;ects. They generally occur in &s;mall
bodies of eight or ten of the &s;ame &s;pecies, and &s;ome|times intermingled
with other flocks of the &s;ame genus, or even of a different genus, &s;uch as
the Cayenne Warblers, &amp;c. It is commonly in the morning that they are found
thus a&s;&s;embled, and then &s;eem to be joyous, and warble their delicate
little notes; the fre&s;hne&s;s of the air &s;eems to in&s;pire the &s;ong, for
they are &s;ilent during the burning heat of the day, and di&s;per&s;e and
retire to the &s;hade of the thicke&s;t parts of the fore&s;t. This habit is
ob&s;erved indeed in many kind of birds, and even in tho&s;e of the woods of
France, where they collect to &s;ing in the morn|ing and evening; but the
Manakins never a&s;&s;emble in the evening, and continue together only from
&s;un-ri&s;e to nine or ten o'clock in the forenoon, and remain &s;eparate
during the re&s;t of the day and the &s;ucceeding night. In general, they
prefer a cool humid &s;ituation, though they never frequent mar&s;hes or the
margins of lakes.</P>

<P>This &s;pecies has been well de&s;cribed by Marc|grave. It is
the large&s;t of all the Manakins; its total length is four inches and a half,
and it is nearly of the bulk of a Sparrow; the upper-part of its head is
covered with fine red feathers, longer than the re&s;t, and which the bird can
erect at plea&s;ure, which gives it the appearance of being cre&s;ted; the back
and the &s;mall &s;uperior coverts of the wings are of a beautiful blue, the
re&s;t of the plumage is velvet black; the iris is of a fine &s;apphire colour;
the bill is black, and the legs are red.</P>
<P>The Abbe Aubry, Rector of St. Louis, has in his cabinet a bird
by the name of <HI>Ti&s;e-guacu of Cuba,</HI> which is perhaps a variety of the
pre|&s;ent, ari&s;ing from the difference of age or &s;ex; the only
di&s;tinction being, that the large feathers on the upper-part of the head are
of a diluter red, and even &s;omewhat yellowi&s;h. The de|&s;ignation given to
it would &s;eem to imply that <PB N="331" REF="369"> it is found in the
I&s;land of Cuba, and perhaps in other parts of America; but it is very rare at
Cayenne, and is a bird of &s;hort flight, and therefore it could hardly pa&s;s
from the continent to Cuba.</P>
<P>The Green Manakin with a red cre&s;t is the young of this
&s;pecies; &s;everal Manakins have been ob&s;erved, who&s;e plumage was

in &s;mall flocks with the other Manakins, but intermingle not with them; they
remain for the mo&s;t part on the ground, and rarely perch on the branches, and
then they uniformly prefer the low ones. They &s;eem to live more upon

<P>We pre&s;ume that the&s;e three birds are only varieties of
the &s;ame &s;pecies, for they are exactly of the &s;ame &s;ize, being only
three inches and eight lines in length; whereas all the preceding &s;pecies,
which have been placed in the order of their magnitude, are four inches and a
half, and four inches and three-fourths, &amp;c. The&s;e three are likewi&s;e
of the &s;ame &s;hape, and even their colours are &s;imilar, if we except
tho&s;e of the head, which in the fir&s;t are of a fine yellow, in the &s;econd
of a bright red, and in the third of a beautiful blue; there is no other
&s;en&s;ible dif|ference in the plumage, which is all uniformly of a fine
glo&s;&s;y black: the feathers which cover the thighs are of a pale yellow,
with an oblong &s;pot of bright red on the exterior &s;urface. In 
<PB N="336" REF="376"> the fir&s;t indeed, the bill is whiti&s;h and the legs
black; in the &s;econd, the bill is black and the legs cinereous; and in the
third, the bill is brown-gray, and the legs reddi&s;h: but the&s;e &s;light
dif|ferences do not appear &s;ufficient to con&s;titute three &s;eparate
&s;pecies, and perhaps one of them is only the female of another. However,
Mau|duit, to whom I communicated this article, a&s;&s;ured me that he never
&s;aw, in the White-headed Manakin, the red feathers that cover the knee in the
Golden-headed Manakin: if this dif|ference were invariable, we might infer that
the&s;e formed two &s;eparate &s;pecies of Manakins: but Sonini a&s;&s;ured us,
that he has &s;een White-headed Manakins with red feathers on their knees, and
there is &s;ome rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that the &s;pecimens ob&s;erved by

<P>THOUGH this bird is of an uniform colour, it is one of the
mo&s;t beautiful of South Ame|rica; for this colour is very beautiful, and its
plu|mage nicely tapered. It feeds upon fruits, per|haps for want of &s;eeds;
&s;ince it differs from the gallinaceous tribe by the &s;hape of its toes only,
which are connected by a membrane, the fir&s;t and &s;econd as far as the third
joint, and the &s;econd with the third no farther than the fir&s;t joint. The
tail is very &s;hort and &s;quare, as are &s;ome coverts of the wings;
&s;everal of the&s;e fea|thers have a &s;ort of fringe on each &s;ide, and the
fir&s;t great feather of each wing is &s;calloped from the tip to one third of
its length: but what cha|racterizes it the be&s;t is, a beautiful cre&s;t on
the crown, longitudinal, and of a &s;emicircular form. In the minute
de&s;criptions which Bri&s;&s;on and Vo&s;ma&euml;r have given, this cre&s;t is
imperfectly depicted; it is not &s;ingle, but double, con&s;i&s;ting

</FIGURE> <PB N="347" REF="388"> of two inclined planes that meet
at the vertex. In other re&s;pects their de&s;criptions are accurate, except
that they are applicable only to the male. The plumage of the male is of a fine
red; that of the female is entirely brown, only there are &s;ome &s;hades of
ru&s;t-colour on the rump, the tail, and the feathers of the wings. The cre&s;t
of the female is al&s;o double, but no &s;o thick, &s;o tall, &s;o round, or
&s;o far protruded on the bill, as in the male. Both male and female are
generally thicker and larger than the Ring-pigeon; but the different
individuals probably vary in &s;ize; for Bri&s;&s;on repre&s;ents this bird of
the bulk of a Roman-pigeon, and Vo&s;ma&euml;r a&s;&s;erts that it is rather
&s;maller than the Common Pigeon. This difference might al&s;o be occa&s;ioned
by the man|ner of &s;tuffing the &s;pecimens; but in the natural &s;tate the
female, though &s;omewhat &s;maller than the male, is undoubtedly much larger
than the Common Pigeon.</P>
<P>The male a&s;&s;umes not the fine red till he has attained
&s;ome age; the fir&s;t year he is only brown like the female; but as he grows
up, his plumage becomes marked with points and &s;pots of rufous, which
gradually deepen into red, though perhaps perfected before advanced age.</P>
<P>Though this bird mu&s;t have attracted the notice of all who
ever &s;aw it, no traveller has de&s;cribed its habits and oeconomy. Sonini de
Manoncour is the fir&s;t who has ob&s;erved it with attention. It lodges not
only in the deep clefts <PB N="348" REF="389"> of the rocks, but even in the
large dark caverns which totally exclude the &s;olar rays; a circum|&s;tance
that has induced many to believe it to be a nocturnal bird; whereas it flies
and &s;ees di&s;|tinctly in the day-time: however, it &s;eems na|turally to
prefer gloomy rece&s;&s;es, &s;ince it is mo&s;t frequent in caves which cannot
be entered with|out the light of torches. We may therefore pre|&s;ume, that
their eyes are con&s;tructed like tho&s;e of cats, and adapted both for the day
and the night. The male and female are equally lively, and extremely wild. It
is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;hoot them, unle&s;s the per&s;on be concealed behind a
rock, where he mu&s;t often wait &s;everal hours before an opportunity occurs;
for the in&s;tant they perceive him, they e&s;cape to a di&s;tance by a flight
which is rapid, though rather low and &s;hort. They feed upon &s;mall wild
fruits, and u&s;ually &s;crape the ground, clap their wings, and &s;hake
them&s;elves like the dunghill fowls; but they neither crow like the cock, nor
cluck like the hen. Their cry re&s;embles the &s;ound of the &s;yllable
<HI>k&eacute;,</HI> pronounced with a &s;hrill drawling tone. They con&s;truct
their ne&s;t rudely in the holes of rocks with &s;mall dry &s;ticks; and
com|monly lay two white &s;pherical eggs, which are of the &s;ize of tho&s;e of
pigeons.</P>
<P>The males emerge oftener from their caverns than the females,
which &s;eldom appear, and pro|bably do not quit their retreats except in the
night. They can ea&s;ily be tamed, and M. de <PB N="349" REF="390"> Manoncour
&s;aw one at the Dutch-po&s;t on the river Maroni, which was allowed freely to
live and run about with the poultry.</P>
<P>They are found in great numbers on the mountain Luca, near
Oyapoc, and on the mountain Courouaye, near the river Aprouack; and the&s;e are
the only parts in this region of America whence we can expect to procure
the&s;e birds. They are much e&s;teemed for the &s;ake of their beautiful
plumage, and are very &s;carce and dear; becau&s;e the &s;avages and negroes,
whether from &s;uper&s;tition or fear, will not venture into the dark caverns
where they lodge.<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Pipra

<P>There is another &s;pecies, or rather variety of the Cock of
the Rock, which is found in the provinces of Peru: its tail is much longer than
that of the preceding, and its feathers have not &s;quare ends; its wings are
not fringed; in&s;tead of an uniform red, both wings and tail are black, and
the rump cinereous; the cre&s;t al&s;o is differ|ent, being lower and
con&s;i&s;ting of detached fea|thers: in other re&s;pects, this Peruvian bird
re|&s;embles the Guiana Cock of the Rock &s;o clo&s;ely, <PB N="350" REF="391">
that we may regard it as a variety of the &s;ame &s;pecies.</P>
<P>We might con&s;ider the&s;e birds as the repre|&s;entatives of
our dunghill poultry in the New World; but I am told that, in the interior
parts of Guiana and Mexico, there are wild fowls which bear &s;till more
analogy. The&s;e are in|deed much &s;maller, being &s;carcely of the &s;ize of
a Common Pigeon; they are generally brown and rufous; but they have the &s;ame
&s;hape, the &s;ame little fle&s;hy comb on the head, and the &s;ame port as
our ordinary fowl; their tail is al&s;o &s;imilar in &s;hape and po&s;ition,
and the males have the crow of the Cock, though feebler. The &s;avages who
inhabit the remote tracts are perfectly well acquainted with the&s;e birds, but
have never reduced them to the dome&s;tic &s;tate; nor is this in the lea&s;t
&s;urpri&s;ing, for they have tamed none of the animals which might have proved
u&s;eful, e&s;pecially the Hoccos or Cura&s;&s;os, the Marails and the Agamis,
among the birds; and the Tapirs, the Pecaris, and the Agamis, among the
quadrupeds. On the con|trary, the ancient Mexicans, who were civilized,
dome&s;ticated &s;ome animals, and particularly the&s;e &s;mall brown fowls.
Gemelli Carreri relates, that they were called <HI>Chiacchialacca;</HI> and he
&s;ubjoins, that they were preci&s;ely like our common poultry, only rather
&s;maller, and their feathers browni&s;h.</P>

<HEAD>The COTINGAS.</HEAD>
<P>FEW birds have &s;uch beautiful plumage as the Cotingas; all
tho&s;e who have had an op|portunity of &s;eeing them, whether travellers or
naturali&s;ts, &s;eem to have been charmed, and &s;peak of them with rapture.
Nature has &s;elected her choice&s;t and her riche&s;t colours, and &s;pread
them with elegance and profu&s;ion: the painting glows with all the tints of
blue, of violet, of red, of orange, of purple, of &s;now-white, and glo&s;&s;y
black; &s;ometimes the&s;e tints melt into each other by the &s;weete&s;t
gradations; at other times they are contra&s;ted with wonderful ta&s;te: the
various reflexions heighten and enliven the whole. The merit is intrin&s;ic; it
is expre&s;&s;ive; it is inimitable.</P>
<P>All the &s;pecies, or, if we chu&s;e, all the branches of the
brilliant family of the Cotingas belong to the New Continent; and there is no
foundation for what &s;ome have alleged, that they are found in Senegal. They
appear to delight in warm countries; they &s;eldom occur &s;outh of Brazil, or
roam north of Mexico: and con&s;equently they would hardly traver&s;e the
immen&s;e &s;tretch of ocean that &s;eparates the continents in tho&s;e
latitudes.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="393"> All that we know of their habits is, that
they never perform di&s;tant journies, but have only periodical flittings,
which are confined within a narrow circle: they appear twice a-year in the
plantations; and though they arrive nearly at the &s;ame time, they are never
ob&s;erved in flocks. They generally haunt the &s;ides of creeks in &s;wampy
ground<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Edwards, who was unacquainted with the
oeconomy of the Cotingas, conjectured, from the &s;tructure of their feet, that
they frequented mar&s;hes.</NOTE>, which has occa&s;ioned &s;ome to call them
water-fowls. They find among the aquatic plants abundance of in&s;ects, on
which they feed, and particularly what are termed <HI>karias</HI> in America,
and which, according to &s;ome, are wood-lice; and according to others, a
&s;ort of ants. The creoles have, it is &s;aid, more motives than one for
hunting after the&s;e birds;&mdash;the beauty of the plumage, which plea&s;es
the eye; and, according to &s;ome, the delicacy of the fle&s;h, which flatters
the palate. But it is difficult to obtain both; for the plu|mage is often
&s;poiled in attempting to &s;kin the bird; and this is probably the rea&s;on
why &s;o many imperfect &s;pecimens are now brought from America. It is &s;aid
that they alight among the rice-crops and do con&s;iderable injury: if this be
true, the creoles have &s;till another rea&s;on for de&s;troying them<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The little which I have related of the habits of the
Cotingas was communicated by M. Aublet: but I mu&s;t add, that M. de Manoncour

this is true only of &s;ome &s;pecies.</NOTE>.</P>

by various tints, which it a&s;&s;umes in different parts; the mo&s;t vivid,

the lower-part of the belly, the thighs, the lower-part of the back, and

a &s;ort of border which &s;urrounds the &s;carlet cap, and this is a little

its cry very loud. Since his time, the &s;pecies has been in a manner lo&s;t,

<P>The mo&s;t remarkable character of the&s;e birds is, a &s;ort
of caruncle under the bill as in the turkies, but differently organized: it is
flaccid and pendulous when the bird is compo&s;ed at re&s;t; but when the
pa&s;&s;ions are rouzed, it &s;wells in every dimen&s;ion, and, in this &s;tate
of ten&s;ion, is more than two inches long, and three or four lines in
circumference at the ba&s;e: this effect is produced by air, which is driven
through an aperture of the palate into the cavity of the caruncle and inflates
it.</P>
<P>This caruncle differs from that of the turkey al&s;o in
another circum&s;tance; it is covered with &s;mall white feathers; and
be&s;ides, it is not peculiar to the male. The plumage of the female is however
entirely different: for in the male the bill and legs are black, all the re&s;t
of a pure &s;potle&s;s white, except &s;ome tints of yellow on the rump, and on
&s;ome of the quills of the tail and of the wings: but in the female the colour
is not &s;o uniform; the upper-part of the head and body, the &s;uperior
coverts of the wings, and mo&s;t of the quills of the wings and of the tail,
are olive mixed with gray; the la|teral <PB N="364" REF="406"> quills of the
tail gray, edged with yellow; the cheeks and forehead white; the feathers of
the throat gray, edged with olive; tho&s;e of the brea&s;t and of the anterior

of the lower &s;urface of the tail lemon-yellow; the inferior coverts of the
wings white, edged with the &s;ame yellow.</P>

<P>IF the beauty of plumage formed the charac|teri&s;tic feature of

as degenerate branches of the original &s;tock. The <HI>Guirarou</HI> has

except a black bar below the eyes, and the tint of the iris, which is
&s;apphire: a uniform light gray is &s;pread over the head, the neck, the

circum|&s;tances in which the <HI>Guirarou</HI> re&s;embles the Cotingas; its
&s;ize is al&s;o nearly the &s;ame, and it inhabits the &s;ame climates: yet
Willughby has referred it to the White-ears; and other excel|lent
ornithologi&s;ts have reckoned it a Fly-catcher. <PB N="368" REF="410"> For my

<P>IN the low, &s;wampy, thin-&s;ettled lands of South America, the
&s;warms of in&s;ects and loath&s;ome reptiles &s;eem to predominate over all
the re&s;t of the animal creation. In Guiana and Brazil<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is al&s;o the ca&s;e in many other parts of America. Pi&s;o
relates, that in Brazil, and even in the wet grounds of Peru, the quantity of
ants is &s;o enormous, that they devour all the &s;eeds which are committed to
the earth; and though fire and water be employed to extirpate them, the
attempts have hitherto failed of &s;ucce&s;s. He adds, that it were much to be
wi&s;hed that Nature had ordained in tho&s;e countries many &s;pecies of
animals like the Ant-eaters <HI>(Myr|mecophagae,</HI> Linn.), which might bore
into the hillocks, and extract the&s;e in&s;ects with their long tongue. Some
of the ants are not larger than tho&s;e of Europe; others are twice or thrice
as large. They rai&s;e hills as large as hay-&s;tacks; and their number is &s;o
va&s;t, that they make tracks &s;everal feet broad in the fields, and in the
woods, and often through an extent of many leagues.&mdash;Fernandez &s;ays
al&s;o that the&s;e ants are larger, and pretty much like our winged-ants, and
that their hills are of an incredible height and width.</NOTE> the ants are
&s;o a&s;toni&s;hingly multiplied, that their hills are &s;ome fathoms wide,
and &s;eve|ral feet in height, and proportionally populous as tho&s;e of
Europe, of which the large&s;t are only two or three feet in diameter; &s;o
that they may be computed to contain two or three hundred times the number of
ants. Yet they exceed &s;till more in number; and in the wilderne&s;&s;es of
Guiana they are an hundred times more fre|quent than in any part of the ancient
continent. <PB N="371" REF="413"> But (&s;uch is the &s;y&s;tem of Nature!)
every crea|ture is the de&s;tined prey of another; and gene|ration and
de&s;truction are ever conjoined. We have in the former work given an account
of the <HI>Tamanoir,</HI> of the <HI>Tamandua,</HI> and of the other quadrupeds
which feed upon ants; we are now to write the hi&s;tory of a kind of birds
which live al&s;o upon the&s;e in&s;ects.&mdash;We were unacquainted with the
exi&s;tence of the Anters till M. de Ma|noncour pre&s;ented the &s;pecimens to
the King's cabinet.</P>
<P>The Anters are natives of Guiana, and are analogous to none of
the European birds; but in the &s;hape of their body, of their bill, of their
feet, and of their tails, they bear a great re&s;em|blance to the
&s;hort-tailed Thru&s;hes <HI>(Breves),</HI> which our nomenclators have
improperly con|founded with the Blackbirds: but as the &s;hort-tailed
Thru&s;hes inhabit the Philippines, the Mo|luccas, the i&s;land of Ceylon,
Bengal, and Mada|ga&s;car, it is more than probable that they are not of the
&s;ame race with the Anters of Ame|rica. The&s;e appear indeed to con&s;titute
a new genus, for which we are wholly indebted to M. de Manoncour, whom I have
&s;o often cited for his exten&s;ive knowledge of foreign birds: he has
pre&s;ented above an hundred and &s;ixty different &s;pecies to the Royal
cabinet; and has al&s;o been &s;o obliging as to communicate to me all the
ob&s;ervations which he made in his voy|ages to Senegal and America. I have on
many <PB N="372" REF="414"> occa&s;ions availed my&s;elf of this information;
and in particular I have formed entirely from it the hi&s;tory of the
Anters.</P>
<P>In French Guiana, and indeed in all countries where natural
hi&s;tory is little known, names are applied to animals from the &s;lighte&s;t
analogies. This has been the ca&s;e with the Anters: they were ob&s;erved to
perch &s;eldom, and run like Partridges; but as they were inferior to the&s;e
birds in &s;ize, they were di&s;tingui&s;hed at Ca|yenne by the appellation of
<HI>Little Partridges.</HI></P>
<P>But the&s;e birds are neither Partridges, nor Blackbirds, nor
&s;hort-tailed Thru&s;hes; only they re&s;emble the la&s;t in their chief
external charac|ters. Their legs are long; their tail and wings &s;hort; the
nail of the hind-toe more hooked, and longer than tho&s;e of the fore-toes; the
bill &s;trait and lengthened; the upper-mandible &s;cal|loped at its extremity,
which bends at the junc|tion of the lower mandible, and projects about a line
beyond it; but their tongue is &s;hort, and be&s;et at the tip with &s;mall
cartilaginous and fle&s;hy threads. Their colours are al&s;o very dif|ferent;
and it is very probable that their in|&s;tincts are di&s;&s;imilar, &s;ince
they inhabit widely di&s;tant climates. When we de&s;cribed the &s;hort-tailed
Thru&s;hes, we were unable to give any account of their natural habits, &s;ince
no tra|vellers had taken notice of them, and therefore we cannot draw any
compari&s;on with tho&s;e of the American Anters.</P>
<P><PB N="373" REF="415"> In general the Anters keep in flocks, and
feed upon &s;mall in&s;ects, and chiefly ants, which are for the mo&s;t part
&s;imiliar to tho&s;e of Europe. They are almo&s;t always found upon the
ant-hills, which in the interior tracts of Guiana, are more than twenty feet in
diameter, and who&s;e in&s;ect nations retard the exten&s;ion of cultivation,
and even con&s;ume the provi&s;ions of life.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal &s;pecies of Anters, which, though very
different in appearance, often a&s;&s;o|ciate together; the large ones and the
&s;mall, the long-tailed and the &s;hort-tailed, are found on the &s;ame
&s;pot. Indeed, if we except the principal kind, which are very few, it is rare
to find in the re&s;t two &s;ubjects perfectly alike; and we may &s;uppo&s;e
that this diver&s;ity ari&s;es from the intermixture of the &s;mall ones: &s;o
that we mu&s;t regard them as mere varieties, and not di&s;tinct &s;pecies.</P>
<P>In all the&s;e birds the wings and tail are very &s;hort, and
therefore ill calculated for flying; accordingly they only trip along the
ground, and hop among the low branches; and though lively and active, they
never &s;hoot through the air.</P>
<P>The voice of the Anters is various in the dif|ferent &s;pecies,
and in &s;ome it is very &s;ingular.</P>
<P>As in&s;ects are the chief food of the&s;e birds, they &s;eek
the &s;olitary tracts where tho&s;e are not mole&s;ted by the intru&s;ion of
man, and &s;warm in abundance. They live in the thicke&s;t and the 
<PB N="374" REF="416"> remote&s;t fore&s;ts, and never vi&s;it the &s;avannas,
the cleared grounds, and &s;till le&s;s the neighbour|hood of plantations. They
employ dry herbs carele&s;sly interwoven in the con&s;truction of their
ne&s;ts, which are hemi&s;pherical, and two, three, or four inches in diameter,
and &s;u&s;pend them by the two &s;ides on the bu&s;hes, two or three feet from
the ground. They lay three or four eggs, which are almo&s;t round.</P>
<P>The fle&s;h of mo&s;t of the&s;e birds is unpalatable food, and
has an oily rank ta&s;te, and when opened, the dige&s;ted ma&s;s of ants, and
of other in&s;ects they &s;wallow, exhales a putrid offen&s;ive &s;mell.</P>

<P>What mo&s;t remarkably di&s;tingui&s;hes this bird, which we

is &s;o &s;trong, that it can be heard at a great di&s;tance, and one would
hardly &s;uppo&s;e it emitted by &s;o &s;mall a bird. The &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of
&s;ounds, which is as rapid as the quick &s;trokes of a bell, continues about
an hour. It appears to be a &s;ort of call &s;imilar to that of the
Par|tridges, only it is heard at all &s;ea&s;ons, and every day, at the
ri&s;ing of the &s;un, and before his &s;etting: however, as the period of love
is not fixed in tho&s;e hot climates, the Partridges, as well as the Anters,

<P>This was called by M. de Manoncour, the <HI>Mu&s;ician of
Cayenne;</HI> I rather chu&s;e to retain the name of <HI>Arada,</HI> which it
receives in its native country.</P>
<P>It is not exactly an Anter; but we have placed it after
the&s;e, becau&s;e it has the &s;ame external characters, though it differs in
its ha|bits. It perches upon trees, and never alights on the ground, except to
pick up ants and other in&s;ects, upon which it feeds. It is di&s;tingui&s;hed
from them by a remarkable property; for all the Anters utter har&s;h cries
without any mole&s;tation, while the Arada has the mo&s;t charming warble. It
commences often with the &s;even notes of the octave, and then whi&s;tles
different &s;oft varied airs, which are lower than tho&s;e of the Night|ingale,
and more like the breathing of a &s;weet toned flute; and it is &s;aid to excel
even that ce|lebrated chori&s;ter of the grove in delicate tender 
<PB N="386" REF="429"> melody. It has al&s;o a &s;ort of whi&s;tle,
re&s;embling that by which a per&s;on calls upon another: tra|vellers
frequently mi&s;take this &s;ound, and, by following it, they are led more
a&s;tray; for as they approach, the bird continually recedes, and whi&s;tles at
intervals.</P>
<P>The Arada avoids &s;ettled &s;pots; it lives alone in the
depth of the va&s;t fore&s;ts, and the &s;oftne&s;s of its melody &s;eems in
&s;ome mea&s;ure to relieve the gloomy &s;tillne&s;s around. It is one of the
very few birds in the New World which Nature has di&s;tingui&s;hed by the
charms of its &s;ong. But the &s;pecies is not numerous; and the traveller may
frequently pur&s;ue his pathle&s;s journey without meeting a &s;ingle Arada to
&s;ooth his &s;ympathetic gloom.</P>
<P>The colours of its plumage corre&s;pond not with the
richne&s;s of its &s;ong; they are dull and ob&s;cure.&mdash;The total length
is four inches, and the tail is radiated tran&s;ver&s;ely with rufous, brown,
and blacki&s;h;&mdash;it exceeds the wings by &s;even lines.</P>
<P>To the Arada we may refer a bird which Mauduit &s;hewed to us:
it re&s;embles that in the length and &s;hape of its bill, the form of its
tail, the length of its legs, in having &s;ome white feathers mixed with the
brown ones on the &s;ides of the neck; the &s;ize is nearly equal, and the
&s;hape &s;imilar; but the tip of its bill is more hooked, its throat is white,
with a half-collar of black below, and its plumage is uniform, 
<PB N="387" REF="430"> and not &s;triped with brown lines, as in the Arada,
who&s;e throat and under-part of its neck are red. We may pre&s;ume therefore,
that this bird is either a di&s;tinct variety of the Arada, or a contiguous
&s;pecies, &s;ince it inhabits Cayenne; though, being unacquainted with its

reckons it a Wild Hen; Pallas terms it a Crane; and Adan&s;on &s;eems to
in&s;inuate that it is a large aquatic bird of the genus of the Lapwing,
be|cau&s;e its knees are prominent, and its hind-toe is placed a little higher

<P><PB N="391" REF="435"> But the Agami is quite a di&s;tinct race.
It re|&s;embles indeed the aquatic birds in the charac|ter which Adan&s;on has

is entirely different. It inhabits the arid mountains, and the upland
fore&s;ts; and never vi&s;its the fens, or the margins of water.&mdash;We have
here another example of the errors into which artificial &s;y&s;tems lead.</P>
<P>Nor is it a Phea&s;ant or Cura&s;&s;o; for not only are its legs
and thighs different, but its toes and nails are much &s;horter. Still more is
it widely &s;eparated from the Common Hen; and it can|not be ranged with the
Cranes, &s;ince its bill, its neck, and its neck, and its legs, are much

gallinaceous birds, and the&s;e &s;cales reach two inches above the knees,
which are not feathered.</P>
<P>The whole of its head, its throat, and the upper half of its
neck, both above and below, are covered with a &s;hort down, which is very
clo&s;e, and feels very &s;oft; the fore-part of the lower &s;urface of the
neck, and the brea&s;t, are covered <PB N="392" REF="436"> with a beautiful
gorget four inches broad, who&s;e brilliant colours vary between green, gold
green, blue, and violet; the upper-part of its back, and the contiguous portion
of its neck, are black; the plumage changes on the hind-part of the back into a
tawny-rufous; but all the under-&s;ide of the body is black, and al&s;o the

the&s;e birds con&s;i&s;ts in the wonderful noi&s;e which they often make,
either of them&s;elves; or when urged by the keepers of the <HI>menagerie.</HI>
I do not wonder that hitherto they have been &s;uppo&s;ed to form this through
the anus. It co&s;t me no little trouble to convince my&s;elf of the contrary.
To &s;ucceed, one mu&s;t be on the ground, and with a bit of bread entice the
bird to come near; then make the noi&s;e, which the keepers can well imitate,
and often di&s;po&s;e the Agami to repeat it. This equivocal noi&s;e is
&s;ometimes preceded by a &s;avage cry, interrupted by a &s;ound approaching
that of <HI>&s;cherck, &s;cherck,</HI> to which &s;ucceeds the hollow
&s;ingular noi&s;e in que&s;tion, which re|&s;embles &s;omewhat the moan of
pigeons. In this way it utters five, &s;ix, or &s;even times, with
precipitation, a hollow noi&s;e emitted from within its body, nearly as if one
pronounced <HI>tou, tou, tou, tou, tou, tou,</HI> with the mouth &s;hut,
re&s;ting upon the la&s;t <HI>teu . . .</HI> a very long time, and terminating
by &s;inking gradually with the &s;ame note. This &s;ound al&s;o re&s;embles
much the lengthened doleful noi&s;e which the Dutch bakers make, by blowing a
gla&s;s trumpet, to inform their cu&s;tomers when the bread comes out of the
oven. This &s;ound, as I have already &s;aid, i&s;&s;ues not from the anus; yet
I am very confident, that it is formed by a &s;light opening of the bill, and
by a &s;ort of lungs peculiar to almo&s;t all birds, though of a dif|ferent
form. This is al&s;o the opinion of M. Pallas, who heard it often with me, and
to whom I gave one of the dead birds for di&s;|&s;ection." The doctor has
communicated to me his ob&s;ervations with re&s;pect to the internal
&s;tructure of the animal, for which I am much obliged to him. 
<Q REND="inline">"The wind-pipe," &s;ays he, "before its
entrance into the brea&s;t, is as thick as a large writing-pen, bony, and quite
cylindrical. In the brea&s;t it becomes cartilaginous, and divides into two
&s;emi-circular canals, which pa&s;s through the lungs, the left one being very
&s;hort, but the right one reaching the bottom of the lower belly, and parted
by tran&s;ver&s;e membranes into three or four lobes."</Q></P> 
<P>The&s;e lungs therefore are undoubtedly the in&s;trument of
the various cries emitted by birds. The air pre&s;&s;ed by the impul&s;ive
action of the fibres, &s;eeks to e&s;cape through the large branches of the
fle&s;hy lungs, and meets with an ob&s;truction from the little ela&s;tic
membranes, which produces pul&s;ations, the origin of all &s;orts of &s;ounds 
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Memoires de l'Academie des
Sciences, <HI>ann&eacute;e</HI> 1753. p. 293.</NOTE>. But, what above all
convinces us that this noi&s;e proceeds not from the anus, if a per&s;on
ob&s;erves attentively when the bird makes it, he will perceive the brea&s;t
and belly to heave, and the bill to open &s;omewhat.

have accurately a&s;cer|tained the &s;ingular power which this bird has of 
<PB N="393" REF="437"> emitting a dull hollow &s;ound, which was &s;up|po&s;ed
to come from the anus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. de la Condamine entertained
this opinion. 
<BIBL><HI>Voyage des Amaxons,</HI> p. 175.</BIBL></NOTE>, and
have di&s;co|vered <PB N="394" REF="438"> that this is a mi&s;taken notion. We
&s;hall only ob&s;erve that in many birds, as well as in the Agami, the
windpipe is bony at its opening, and becomes cartilaginous in its de&s;cent,
and in general the cries of &s;uch birds are deep; but there are al&s;o many
birds on the other hand who&s;e windpipe is cartilaginous at its ri&s;e, and
termi|nates bony in the brea&s;t, and the&s;e have com|monly &s;hrill
notes.</P>
<P>The odd &s;ort of noi&s;e which this bird makes, is probably
owing to the extent of lungs, and the capacity of their membranous cells. But
it is unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;uppo&s;e with Vo&s;ma&euml;r, that the Agami is
obliged to open its bill a little in order to give pa&s;&s;age to the &s;ound;
for any &s;udden motion in the bowels is communicated through the mu&s;cles and
teguments to the external air, which conveys the impul&s;e to the ear. We have
often occa&s;ion to notice this circum&s;tance; and it appears to be prejudice
that the &s;ounds pro|duced by animals are always tran&s;mitted through the
throat, or through the alimentary canal. Nor is this &s;pecies of
ventriloqui&s;m peculiar to the Agami; the Cura&s;&s;o without opening its bill
makes a &s;imilar hollow &s;ound, which is even more articulate and more
powerful. Indeed the &s;ame property &s;eems to obtain, though in a le&s;s
degree, in many kinds of birds in which the lungs are proportionally larger
than in the qua|drupeds. The hoar&s;e murmur which the Turkey-cock makes before
his gobble, the cooing which <PB N="395" REF="439"> the Pigeon effects without
motion of the mouth, are of this nature; only in the&s;e the &s;ound ri&s;es
near the bottom of the throat; but in the Cu|ra&s;&s;o, and e&s;pecially in the
Hocco, it has its ori|gin deeper.</P>
<P>In regard to the manner in which the Agami lives in the
dome&s;tic &s;tate, I &s;hall quote the words of Vo&s;ma&euml;r:&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">"When the&s;e birds are well kept, they are
attentive to cleanline&s;s, and often peck the feathers of the body and wings
with their bill: if they frolic with each other, they per|form all their
movements by hopping, and vio|lently flapping their wings. The change of food
and of climate certainly cools here (in Holland) their natural ardor for
propagation. Their ordinary &s;ub&s;i&s;tence is grain, &s;uch as buck-wheat,
&amp;c. but they al&s;o eat readily &s;mall fi&s;h, fle&s;h, and bread. This
fondne&s;s for fi&s;h, and the uncommon length of their legs, &s;hew that they
partake of the nature of the Herons and Cranes, and that they belong to the
cla&s;s of the aquatic birds."</Q> We mu&s;t ob&s;erve here that the
fond|ne&s;s for fi&s;h is no proof, &s;ince poultry are as greedy of this
&s;ort of food as of any other. 
<Q REND="inline">"What <HI>Pi&s;torius</HI> relates," continues
Vo&s;ma&euml;r, "with re&s;pect to the gratitude of this bird, may put many to
the blu&s;h. When tamed, it di&s;tin|gui&s;hes its ma&s;ter and benefactor with
marks of its affection. Having reared one, I had an op|portunity of
experiencing this my&s;elf: when I opened its cage in the morning, the kind
ani|mal <PB N="396" REF="440"> hopped round me, expanding both his wings, and
<HI>trumpeting</HI> (this is the term which we may employ to expre&s;s the
noi&s;e) from his bill, and behind, as if he wi&s;hed me good mor|ning. He
&s;hewed no le&s;s attention when I went out and returned again; no &s;ooner
did he per|ceive me from a di&s;tance than he ran to meet me: and even when I
happened to be in a boat, and &s;et my foot on &s;hore, he welcomed me with the
&s;ame compliments, which he re&s;erved for me alone, and never be&s;towed them
upon others."</Q></P>
<P>We &s;hall &s;ubjoin a number of additional facts, which were
communicated by M. de Manon|cour.</P>
<P>In the &s;tate of nature the Agami inhabits the va&s;t fore&s;ts
in the warm climates of America, and never vi&s;its the cleared grounds,
&s;till le&s;s the &s;ettled &s;pots. It a&s;&s;ociates in numerous flocks, and
prefers not the &s;wamps and &s;ides of lakes; for it is often found on the
mountains, and in hilly &s;ituations. It walks and runs rather than flies,
&s;ince it never ri&s;es more than a few feet, and only to reach &s;ome &s;hort
di&s;tance, or to gain &s;ome low branch. It feeds upon wild fruits, like the
Cura&s;&s;os, the Marails, and other gallinaceous birds. When &s;urpri&s;ed in
its haunts, it makes its e&s;cape by &s;wiftne&s;s of feet, &s;eldom u&s;ing
its wings, and at the &s;ame time emits a &s;hrill cry like that of the
Turkey.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds &s;crape the earth at the roots of the large trees
to form a bed for their eggs; and <PB N="397" REF="441"> employ no lining, and
con&s;truct no ne&s;t. They lay many eggs, from ten to &s;ixteen; but the
number is proportioned, as in all other birds, to the age of the female; they
are almo&s;t &s;pherical, larger than hens eggs, and tinged with light green.
The young Agamis retain their down, or rather their fir&s;t di&s;hevelled
feathers, much longer than our chickens, or infant-partridges: the&s;e are
&s;ometimes near two inches long, and before a certain age they might pa&s;s
for animals covered with &s;ilky hairs, which are clo&s;e like fur, and feel
&s;oft; the true feathers appear not till they have attained the fourth of
their full growth.</P>
<P>The Agami is not only tamed ea&s;ily, but be|comes attached to
its benefactor with all the fondne&s;s and fidelity of dogs; and of this
di&s;|po&s;ition it &s;hews the mo&s;t unequivocal proofs. When bred up in the
hou&s;e, it loads its ma&s;ter with care&s;&s;es, and follows his motions; and
if it conceives a di&s;like to per&s;ons on account of their forbidding figure,
their offen&s;ive &s;mell, or of in|juries received, it will pur&s;ue them
&s;ometimes to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, biting their legs, and
te&s;|tifying every mark of di&s;plea&s;ure. It obeys the voice of its
ma&s;ter, and even an&s;wers to the call of all tho&s;e to whom it bears no
grudge. It is fond of care&s;&s;es, and offers its head and neck to be
&s;troked; and if once accu&s;tomed to the&s;e fa|miliarities, it becomes
trouble&s;ome, and will not be &s;atisfied without continual fondling. It makes
<PB N="398" REF="442"> its appearance as often as its ma&s;ter &s;its down to
table, and begins with driving out the dogs and cats, and taking
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the room: for it is &s;o ob&s;tinate and bold, that it
never yields, and often after a tough battle, can put a middle-&s;ized dog to
flight. It avoids the bites of its anta|goni&s;t by ri&s;ing in the air, and
retaliates with violent blows with its bill and nails, aimed chiefly at the
eyes; and after it gains the &s;uperiority, it pur&s;ues the victory with the
utmo&s;t rancour, and, if not parted, will de&s;troy the fugitive. By its
intercour&s;e with man, its in&s;tincts became moulded like tho&s;e of dogs;
and we are a&s;|&s;ured the Agamis can be trained to tend a flock of &s;heep.
It even &s;hews a degree of jealou&s;y of its rivals; for when at table it
bites fiercely the naked legs of the negroes, and other do|me&s;tics, who come
near its ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>The fle&s;h of the&s;e birds, e&s;pecially when they are young,
is not ill-flavoured, but is dry, and commonly hard. The rich brilliant part of
the plumage which covers the brea&s;t, is &s;eparated from the re&s;t, and
prepared for the ornaments of dre&s;s.</P>
<P>M. De la Borde has al&s;o communicated the following particulars
in regard to this bird. 
<Q REND="inline">"The wild Agamis," &s;ays he, "are di&s;per&s;ed
in the back country, and are no longer found in the neighbourhood of Cayenne .
. . and they are very common in the remote un&s;ettled tracts. . . . They are
always found in the im|men&s;e <PB N="399" REF="443"> fore&s;ts, in flocks from
ten and twelve to forty. . . . They fly from the ground to the low trees, where
they remain &s;till, and in &s;uch &s;ituation the hunters often kill &s;everal
without &s;caring away the re&s;t. . . . Some per&s;ons imitate their hoar&s;e
murmur &s;o exactly, as to decoy them to their feet. . . . When the hunters
di&s;cover a flock of Agamis, they de|&s;i&s;t not till they have killed
&s;everal: the&s;e birds &s;eldom or never fly, and their fle&s;h is but
ordinary, black, and always hard; however, that of the young ones is more
palatable. . . . No bird is &s;o ea&s;ily tamed as this, and there are always
many of them in the &s;treets of Cayenne. . . . They even roam out of town, but
return in due time to their ma&s;ter. . . . They allow one to come near them,
and handle them at plea&s;ure; they are afraid neither of dogs, nor of birds of
prey, in the court-yard; they a&s;&s;ume the a&s;cendency over the poultry, and
keep them in great &s;ubjection: they feed like the hens, the <HI>Marils,</HI>
and the <HI>Paraguas;</HI> but when very young, they prefer &s;mall worms and
fle&s;h to every thing el&s;e.</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"Almo&s;t all the birds have a trick of
follow|ing people through the &s;treets and out of town, even per&s;ons that
they had never &s;een before. It is difficult to get rid of them: if you enter
a hou&s;e, they will wait your return, and again join you, though often after
an interval of three hours."</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"I have &s;ometimes," adds M. 
<PB N="400" REF="444"> de la Borde, "betaken my&s;elf to my heels, but they ran
fa&s;ter, and always got before me; and when I &s;topped, they &s;topped
al&s;o. I know one which invariably follows all the &s;trangers who enter its
ma&s;ter's hou&s;e; ac|companies them into the garden, takes as many turns as
they do, and attends them back again<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Note
communicated by M. de la Borde, King's phy&s;ician as Cayenne, in
1776.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>As the habits and oeconomy of this bird were little known, I
have thought proper to tran&s;cribe the different accounts which I have
received. It appears that of all the feathered tribes, the Agami is the mo&s;t
attached to the &s;ociety of man; and in this re&s;pect it is as eminently
di&s;tingui&s;hed above them all, as the dog is above the other quadrupeds. The
di&s;po&s;ition of the Agami is the more remarkable, &s;ince it is the only
bird that has a &s;ocial turn; whereas &s;everal of the quadrupeds di&s;cover
attachment to man, though inferior in degree to that of the dog. And is it not
&s;trange, that an animal, &s;o pecu|liarly formed for &s;ociety, has never
been do|me&s;ticated? Nothing can better &s;hew the im|men&s;e di&s;tance
between the civilized man and the rude &s;avage, than the dominion obtained
over the lower creation. The former has made the dog, the hor&s;e, the ox, the
camel, the ele|phant, the rein-deer, &amp;c. &s;ub&s;ervient to his utility, or
his plea&s;ure: he has drawn together <PB N="401" REF="445"> the hens, the
gee&s;e, the turkies, and the ducks, and has lodged the pigeons. The &s;avage
has overlooked advantages the mo&s;t obvious and the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential to
his comfort. It is &s;ociety that gives &s;pring to activity; that awakens the
dormant faculties; and that expands, informs, and enlivens the whole!<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the Gold-brea&s;ted Trumpeter:&mdash;

<HEAD>The TINAMOUS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is the name given
to the&s;e birds in Guiana.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>THESE birds, which are peculiar to the warm parts of America,
may be regarded as a part of the gallinaceous cla&s;s; for they re&s;emble the
Bu&s;tard and Partridge, though they differ in &s;everal properties. But there
are certain habits in animals which re&s;ult from the nature of the climate,
and from local circum&s;tances, and which ought not to be deemed e&s;&s;ential
characters.&mdash;Thus many birds, &s;uch as Partridges, which remain
con&s;tantly on the ground in Europe, perch in America; and even the palmated
aqua|tic fowls, pa&s;s the day in the water, and return to lodge during the
night among the trees. The dangers with which they are &s;urrounded appear to
drive them to &s;uch retreats. The im|men&s;e &s;warms of in&s;ects and
reptiles, engendered by the heat and the moi&s;ture of the climate, threaten
every moment their de&s;truction. If they ventured to repo&s;e upon the ground,
the den&s;e columns of ants would attack them in their &s;lumbers, and reduce
them to &s;keletons. The Quails are the only birds in tho&s;e countries which
re&s;t upon the &s;urface; and they often fall a prey to the voracity of the
&s;erpents. Nor is it im|probable, <PB N="403" REF="447"> that the Quails have
been introduced &s;ince the di&s;covery of America, and that they have not yet
acquired the habits &s;uited to their new &s;ituation, or learned to guard
again&s;t the a&s;&s;aults of their numerous foes.</P>
<P>We &s;hould have ranged the genus of the <HI>Ti|namous</HI>
after that of the Bu&s;tard; but the&s;e birds were, at that time, but
imperfectly known, and we are indebted to M. de Manoncour for the prin|cipal
facts relating to their hi&s;tory, and al&s;o for the &s;pecimens pre&s;ented
to the Royal Cabinet, from which we have made the de&s;criptions.</P>
<P>The Spani&s;h inhabitants of America<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Letter of M. Godin des Odonnais, to M. de la Condamine,
1773, p. 19. note fir&s;t.</BIBL></NOTE>, and the French &s;ettlers at Cayenne,
have both termed the&s;e birds <HI>Partridges;</HI> and the appellation has
been adopted by &s;ome nomenclators<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bri&s;&s;on.&mdash;Barrere.</NOTE>, though altogether improper:
for the <HI>Tinamous</HI> are di&s;|tingui&s;hed by their long &s;lender bill,
blunt at the tip, black above, and whiti&s;h below; their no&s;trils oblong,
and placed near the middle of their bill; their hind-toe is very &s;hort, and
does not re&s;t upon the ground; their nails are very &s;hort, broad, and
channelled beneath; their legs al&s;o differ from tho&s;e of Partridges, being
covered behind, as in the poultry, with &s;cales, their whole length, &s;haped
like &s;mall &s;hells; but the upper-part projects and forms inequalities not
ob&s;erved on the legs of poultry. In all the Tinamous, <PB N="404" REF="448">
the throat and craw are thinly &s;trewed with &s;traggling feathers; the quills
of the tail are &s;o &s;hort, that in &s;ome they are wholly concealed by the
&s;uperior coverts.&mdash;Thus they are improperly named Partridges, &s;ince
they differ in &s;o many e&s;&s;ential characters.</P>
<P>But they differ al&s;o from the Bu&s;tard, by &s;e|veral of
their principal characters, and e&s;peci|ally by having a fourth toe behind,
which is wanting in the Bu&s;tard. In &s;hort, we have judged it requi&s;ite to
range them in a &s;eparate genus, under the name which they receive in their
native country.</P>
<P>All the &s;pecies of the Tinamous pa&s;s the night upon the
trees, and &s;ometimes perch during the day; but they always &s;ettle among the
lowe&s;t branches, and never mount to the &s;ummits: and this circum&s;tance
&s;eems to imply the probability that they are not actuated by original
impul&s;e, but directed by con&s;iderations of &s;afety.</P>
<P>The Tinamous are, in general, excellent for the table; their
fle&s;h is white, firm, clo&s;e, and juicy, e&s;pecially about the wings, and
ta&s;tes like that of the Red Partridge. The thighs and rump have commonly a
di&s;agreeable bitterne&s;s, which is occa&s;ioned by the fruit of the Indian
reed upon which they feed. The &s;ame bitter ta&s;te is ob&s;erved in the
Ring-Pigeons which eat the&s;e fruits. But when the Tinamous live upon other
fruits, &s;uch as wild cherries, &amp;c. their fle&s;h is uniformly delicate,
but &s;till has none <PB N="405" REF="449"> of the <HI>fumet.</HI> In the
&s;ultry humid climate of Cayenne, meat will not keep more than twenty-four
hours from putrefaction, and no &s;ort of game can be allowed time to mellow
and ac|quire that delicious flavour which con&s;titutes its excellence. The&s;e
birds, like all tho&s;e which have a craw, often &s;wallow the fruits without
brui&s;ing or even cracking them; they are par|ticularly fond of the wild
cherries, and al&s;o of the produce of the <HI>common palm,</HI> and even of
that of the coffee-&s;hrub, when they can find it. Nor do they cull their
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence from the trees; they only collect the fruits which have
dropped. They &s;crape the ground to form their ne&s;t, which is u&s;ually
nothing but a &s;ingle layer of dry herbs. They lay twice a-year, and have
numerous broods; which &s;hews that the&s;e birds and the Agamis are of the
gallinaceous cla&s;s, which is remark|ably prolific. Like the&s;e al&s;o, they
fly heavily, and to &s;hort di&s;tances, but run &s;wiftly on the ground; they
form little flocks, and it is un|common to find them either &s;ingle or in
pairs; they call each other in all &s;ea&s;ons; in the morn|ing and evening,
and &s;ometimes too during the day: this call is a &s;low, quavering, plaintive
whi&s;tle, which the fowlers imitate to bring them near; for this game is the
mo&s;t common and the be&s;t which that country affords.</P>
<P>We &s;hall add a remarkable circum&s;tance with re&s;pect to
the&s;e genus of birds, that, as in the Anters, the female is larger than the
male; a <PB N="406" REF="450"> property which in Europe is found only in the
rapacious tribe. In the &s;hape of the body, however, and in the di&s;tribution
of the colours, the females are almo&s;t entirely like the males.</P>

a Partridge. Its fle&s;h is as delicate as that of the other kinds, but it lays
only five or &s;ix eggs, and &s;ometimes no more than three or four, which are
rather larger than Pigeons eggs; they are almo&s;t &s;pherical, and as white as
tho&s;e of hens. The Little Tina|mous do not form their ne&s;t like the Great
Ti|namous, by &s;craping the ground; they build it with long narrow leaves on
the lowe&s;t branches of &s;hrubs: it is hemi&s;pherical, about &s;ix inches in
diameter, and five inches high. Of all the four &s;pecies, this is the only one
which does not live con&s;tantly in the woods; it often frequents the young

fruits, but live upon flies, gnats, and other winged in&s;ects. The genus
comprehends nu|merous &s;pecies, which vary exceedingly in point of &s;ize,
from that of the Nightingale to that of the Shrike. Some characters however are
com|mon to them all: their bill is compre&s;&s;ed, broad at the ba&s;e, and
almo&s;t triangular, be&s;et with bri&s;tles, and the tip bent into a little
hook in many of the middle &s;pecies and more curved in all the large
&s;pecies; the tail is of con&s;ider|able length, and only half covered by the
wings. Their bill is al&s;o &s;calloped near the point; a property which they
&s;hare with the Blackbird, the Thru&s;h, and &s;ome other birds.</P>
<P>Their di&s;po&s;ition is in general &s;hy and &s;olitary, and
their notes are neither lively nor melodious. Sub&s;i&s;ting in the region of
air, they &s;eldom leave the &s;ummits of the lofty mountains, and are rarely
&s;een on the ground. Their habit of cling|ing to the branches would &s;eem to

properly termed its <HI>marriage &s;uit,</HI> becau&s;e it a&s;|&s;umes this at
pairing, and lays it a&s;ide after the breeding is over. The bird is then in
its full beauty: a white collar three lines broad encircles its neck, which is
of the fine&s;t black; its head is of the &s;ame colour, except the front and
the face, which are bright white; its back and its tail are &s;tained with the
black of the head; its rump is variegated with black and white; a white
&s;treak of a line in breadth borders for &s;ome way the outermo&s;t quills of
the tail; the wings, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;eventeen quills, are of a deep
che&s;nut; the third and the four fol|lowing are tipt with a much lighter
brown, which, when the wings are clo&s;ed, has a very fine effect: all the
quills, the two fir&s;t excepted, <PB N="420" REF="466"> have a white &s;pot on
the outer edge, which en|larges the nearer it is to the body; &s;o that the
outer-edge of the la&s;t quill is entirely white; the throat, the brea&s;t, and
the belly are white; the bill and the legs black. There is a remarkable
lu&s;tre and glo&s;s &s;pread over the whole of the plumage; but the&s;e
beauties are gone before the beginning of July. The colours grow dilute and
du&s;ky; the collar fir&s;t di&s;appears, and the re&s;t &s;oon becomes
&s;tained and ob&s;cure, and the male is no longer di&s;tingui&s;hable from the
female. 
<Q REND="inline">"I have frequently met with bird-catchers,"
&s;ays Lottinger, "who &s;pread the nets on the &s;prings in places where they

However, Aldrovandus &s;eems to indicate the change of this Flycatcher, which
he has well de&s;cribed in ano|ther place<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He
de&s;cribes its collar, the white &s;pot on its wing: he com|mends its beauty.

the wings; the under-part of the body white, and the re&s;t black. The&s;e
properties &s;ufficiently di&s;criminate the Collared Black Flycatcher.</P>
<P>This bird arrives in Lorraine about the mid|dle of April. It
lives in the fore&s;ts, tho&s;e e&s;pe|cially which con&s;i&s;t of tall trees,
and breeds in the holes of the trunks, &s;ometimes pretty deep, and at a
con&s;iderable height above the &s;urface of the ground. Its ne&s;t is formed
of &s;mall &s;talks of gra&s;s, and a little mo&s;s, which covers the bot|tom
of the cavity. It lays &s;ix eggs. After the young are hatched, the parents
frequently go in and out, carrying &s;upplies of food; and this care of their
infant brood often betrays the re|treat, which would otherwi&s;e be difficult
to di&s;|cover.</P>
<P>They &s;ub&s;i&s;t only upon flies, and other wing|ed
in&s;ects. They are never &s;een on the ground; and for the mo&s;t part they
keep very high, flut|tering from tree to tree. They have no &s;ong, but only an
exceeding &s;hrill plaintive accent, which turns upon the &s;harp note
<HI>crr&icirc;, crr&icirc;.</HI> They appear &s;ad and gloomy; but their
attach|ment to their offspring in&s;pires activity, and even courage.</P>
<P>Lorraine is not the only province in France where the Collared
Black Flycatcher is found. Hebert has informed us, that one was &s;een in Brie,
but where it is little known, becau&s;e it is wild and tran&s;itory. We
our&s;elves found one <PB N="422" REF="468"> of the&s;e Flycatchers on the
tenth of May 1773, in a &s;mall park near Montbard in Burgundy; and it was in
the &s;ame &s;tate of plumage as that de&s;cribed by Bri&s;&s;on. Of the great
coverts, which he &s;ays are tipt with white, tho&s;e only which were next the
body were &s;uch, and the more remote were brown; the inferior coverts alone of
the tail were white, the &s;uperior ones were blacki&s;h-brown; the rump was
dull pearl|gray; the nape of the neck where the collar was &s;ituated, was
lighter than the head and the back; the middle quills of the wings were near
the tip of the &s;ame brown as the great quills; the tongue appears to be
indented at the tip, broad for the &s;ize of the bird, but proportioned to the
breadth of the bottom of the bill; the inte&s;tinal tube was eight or nine
inches long; the gizzard mu&s;cular, preceded by a dilatation of the
<HI>oe&s;ophagus;</HI> there were &s;ome marks of a <HI>coecum;</HI> and no
gall-bladder. The bird was a male, and the te&s;ticles &s;eemed to be a line in
diameter; it weighed three gros.</P>
<P>In this &s;pecies of Flycatchers, the ends of the wings meet,
and &s;tretch beyond the middle of the tail; which is the rever&s;e of what
generally takes place in the genus.&mdash;There are &s;everal inaccuracies in
the figures given of it in the <HI>Planches Enlumin&eacute;es.</HI></P>
<P>This pen&s;ive bird enjoys a quiet peaceful life, protected by

Flycatcher of Senegal.</HI> The&s;e hand&s;ome birds may be de&s;cribed
toge|ther; they are of the &s;ame &s;ize, and are natives of the &s;ame
climate; and the di&s;tribution of their colour is &s;imilar in both. It is
probable that they are the male and female of the &s;ame &s;pecies. The white
line which pa&s;&s;es upon the eye, and encircles the head with a &s;ort of
little diadem, is not &s;o entire or di&s;tinct in any other of the ge|nus. The
fir&s;t is the &s;maller, being only three inches and a half long; a rufous
&s;pot covers the top of the head, which is &s;urrounded by the 
<PB N="425" REF="471"> white ring: from the exterior angle of the eye an oval
black &s;pot extends, which is bounded above by the ring, and &s;tretches into
a point near the tip of the bill; the throat is white; a light rufous &s;pot
marks the brea&s;t; the back is light-gray, &s;pread upon white; the tail and
the wings are blacki&s;h. A white line extends obliquely on their middle
coverts, and the &s;ame coverts are edged with &s;cales of the rufous colour of
the brea&s;t. A glo&s;&s;y tran&s;parency is &s;pread over all the plumage of
this bird; &s;till lighter and more vivid on that of the other, which is
&s;impler in its colours, con&s;i&s;ting of a mixture of light gray, of white,
and of black, and is not inferior in point of beauty; the white bar pa&s;&s;es
upon the eyes; a hor&s;e-&s;hoe of the &s;ame colour ri&s;es pointed under the
bill, and is cut &s;quare on the brea&s;t, which is di&s;tingui&s;hed by a
black belt; the top of the neck is black, which mingling with the white of the
back melts into gray; the quills are black, fringed with white, and the white
line of the coverts opens into fe&s;toons; the &s;houlders are black; but there
is a little fringed white interwoven with all this black; and through all the
white of the plumage &s;mall black &s;hades are inter&s;per&s;ed, which are

<P>We &s;hall con&s;ider the Cre&s;ted Flycatcher of the i&s;land

as forming one &s;pecies. The i&s;land of Bourbon, placed in the mid&s;t of a
va&s;t ocean, and &s;ituated between the tropics, enjoys an uniform
tem|perature, which requires not periodical migra|tions, and when fir&s;t
vi&s;ited by the European &s;hips contained no land bird. Tho&s;e found in it
at pre&s;ent have been carried thither by chance or de&s;ign; nor mu&s;t it be
regarded as the native &s;eat of original &s;pecies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We
find al&s;o two Flycatchers of the i&s;le of Bourbon, which we &s;hall barely
mention, convinced that they belong to &s;ome &s;pecies on the continent of
Africa. The one is repre&s;ented in the <HI>Illumined Plates,</HI> N^o 572,
Fig. 3; it is &s;mall, and quite black, except a little rufous which it has
under its tail; and, notwith&s;tanding the differ|ence of colour, we may
&s;uppo&s;e it to be a variety of the Cape Flycatchers, which we have already
referred to our Collared Black Flycatcher: the&s;e differences of plumage being
apparently no other than what we &s;ee it undergo it&s;elf, and which the
influence of a hotter climate mu&s;t render more exten&s;ive and rapid,
e&s;pecially as it is naturally di&s;po&s;ed to change. M. Bri&s;&s;on

&s;hall therefore cla&s;s <PB N="427" REF="473"> the bird di&s;covered on the
i&s;land with its analo|gous one of the continent. In fact, the differ|ences
between them are not greater than tho&s;e which often occur among individuals
of this genus; their figure, their bulk, and their prin|cipal colours, are the
&s;ame; in both the head is furni&s;hed with &s;mall feathers, half-rai&s;ed
into a black cre&s;t, with green and violet reflections; this black de&s;cends
in the Senegal Flycatcher like a &s;quare &s;pot upon the brea&s;t, and the
fore|part of the neck. In that of Bourbon, the black covers only the head, with
the eye, and al&s;o the lower-mandible; but, in other &s;ubjects, it is
&s;pread al&s;o upon the top of the neck. In both the under-part of the body is
of a fine light &s;late|gray, and the upper-&s;ide bay, which is more vivid in
that of Bourbon, and deeper and che&s;|nut in that of Senegal; and this colour,
which extends equally over the whole of the tail and wings of the la&s;t, is
inter&s;ected by a little white in the other, and a&s;&s;umes a deeper ca&s;t
on the coverts, which are al&s;o fringed with three lighter &s;treaks. The
blacki&s;h colour of the quills has only a light ru&s;ty border on the
out&s;ide, and whiti&s;h on the in&s;ide of the webs. The greate&s;t difference
occurs in the tail; that of the Bour|bon Flycatcher is &s;hort and &s;quare,
being only two inches and a half long; the tail of the Sene|gal Flycatcher is
more than four inches, and is tapered from the two middle quills, which are the
longe&s;t, to the outer ones, which are two <PB N="428" REF="474"> inches
&s;horter. This difference may be imputed to the effect of age, &s;ea&s;on, or
of &s;ex: at any rate, the cla&s;&s;ing of them together will excite a fuller
inve&s;tigation, and an attention to the points of di&s;erimination.</P>

more vivid and more &s;pread than in the other, where the lighter tint &s;carce

other re&s;pects the two birds are &s;imilar. They are rather &s;maller than
the Nightingale, being five inches and eight lines long; the bill is eight
lines, and &s;carcely curved at the tip, and the wings reach not to the middle;
the orange &s;pot on the head is edged with a blacki&s;h a&s;h|colour, a white

<P>The u&s;eful de&s;tination of the Flycatchers will occur to
the mo&s;t &s;uperficial ob&s;erver. The in&s;ect tribes elude the interference
of man; and though de&s;picable as individuals, they often be|come formidable
by their numbers. In&s;tances are recorded of their multiplying to &s;uch an
amazing degree as to darken the air; of their devouring the whole vegetable
productions; and of their carrying in their train the accumulated ills of
famine and pe&s;tilence. Happily for man|kind &s;uch calamities are rare, and
Nature has wi&s;ely provided the proper remedies. Mo&s;t birds &s;earch for
in&s;ects' eggs; many feed on their groveling <HI>larvae;</HI> &s;ome live upon
their cru&s;taceous cry&s;alids; and the Flycatchers &s;eize them after they
e&s;cape from pri&s;on, exulting on their wings. Hence in autumn, when the&s;e
birds migrate into other climates, the &s;warms of <PB N="449" REF="495">
gnats, flies, and beetles, are in our latitudes more than u&s;ually numerous.
But in the tropi|cal countries, where heat and moi&s;ture con&s;pire to ripen
the exuberance of in&s;ect life, the Fly-catchers are more e&s;&s;ential. All
Nature is ba|lanced, and the circle of generation and de&s;truc|tion is
perpetual! The philo&s;opher contemplates with tender melancholy this cruel
&s;y&s;tem of war; he &s;trives in vain to reconcile it with his ideas of
benevolence of intention: but he is forcibly &s;truck with the nice

<HI>Schet-all,</HI> and <HI>Schet-Vouloulou,</HI> which &s;eem to denote the
Rufous Schet and the Variegated Schet, and mark only two varieties of the
&s;ame &s;pecies. Bri&s;&s;on reckons three; but a few <PB N="460" REF="507">
differences in the colours are not &s;ufficient to con&s;titute di&s;tinct
&s;pecies, where the &s;hape, the &s;ize, and all the other proportions, are
the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The Schets have the long form of the Wag-tail; they are rather
larger, mea&s;uring &s;ix inches and a half to the end of the true tail, not to
mention two feathers which extend almo&s;t five inches farther; the bill is
&s;even lines, triangular, very flat, broad at the ba&s;e, be&s;et with
bri&s;tles at the corners, and with hardly any perceptible curve at the point:
a beautiful black|i&s;h-green cre&s;t, with the lu&s;tre of burni&s;hed
&s;teel, is bent &s;mooth back, and covers the head; the iris is yellow, and
the eye-lid blue.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t variety, the &s;ame dark colour that paints the
cre&s;t, encircles the neck, and inve&s;ts the back, the great quills of the
wings and of the tail, of which the two long feathers mea|&s;ure &s;even
inches, and are white, as are al&s;o the &s;mall quills of the wings, and all
the under-part of the body.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Schet-all,</HI> the colour of the cre&s;t ap|pears
only on the great quills of the wings, who&s;e coverts are marked with broad
white lines; all the re&s;t of the plumage is a bright gilded bay, which
Edwards terms a <HI>fine &s;hining cinnamon,</HI> which is &s;pread equally
over the tail and the two long projecting &s;hafts; the&s;e &s;hafts are
&s;imilar to tho&s;e which are &s;ent off from the tail in the Angola and
Aby&s;&s;inian Rollers, only <PB N="461" REF="508"> in the&s;e birds they are
the outermo&s;t, while in the Madaga&s;car Moucherolle they occupy the
middle.</P>
<P>The third variety, or the <HI>Schet-Vouloulou,</HI> has
&s;carcely any difference from the preceding, except that the two projecting
feathers of the tail are whiti&s;h; the re&s;t of the plumage is bay-coloured,
as in the <HI>Schet-all.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>Schet-all</HI> which is pre&s;erved in the King's
Cabinet, the&s;e two feathers are &s;ix inches long; in another &s;pecimen, I
found them to be eight inches, and the outer webs edged with black
three-fourths of their length, and the remainder white; in a third, the&s;e two
long feathers were entirely wanting; whether we mu&s;t impute this to &s;ome
accident, to the age, or to the moulting, which Edwards thinks la&s;ts &s;ix
months in the&s;e birds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<Q REND="inline">"I received this bird (the

them &s;ix months in the year . . . . which I have &s;een in &s;ome long|tailed

lofty trees; and are very numerous in Guiana. They breed in the hollow trunks,
or in the clefts of the branches below the &s;hade of the mo&s;t leafy bough.
If one attempts to plunder their young, their natural audacity changes into
in|trepid fury; they contend ob&s;tinately; they dart upon the per&s;on;

<P>From the account which Cate&s;by has given of this bird, we do
not he&s;itate to cla&s;s it with the Pipiri of St. Domingo, &s;ince its
di&s;po&s;ition and its habits are the &s;ame<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<Q REND="inline">"The courage of this little bird is
&s;ingular. He pur&s;ues and puts to flight all kinds of birds that come near
his &s;tation, from the &s;malle&s;t to the large&s;t, none e&s;caping his
fury; nor did I ever &s;ee any that dared to oppo&s;e him while flying, for he
does not offer to attack them when &s;itting. I have &s;een one of them fix on
the back of an Eagle, and per&s;ecute him &s;o that he has turned on his back
into various po&s;tures in the air, in order to get rid of him; and at la&s;t
was forced to alight on the top of the next tree, from whence he dared not to
move till the little Tyrant was tired, or thought fit to leave him.&mdash;This
is the con&s;tant practice of the cock, while the hen is breeding; he &s;its on
the top of a bu&s;h, or &s;mall tree not far from her ne&s;t, near which if any
&s;mall birds approach, he drives them away; but the great ones, as Crows,
Hawks, Eagles, he will not &s;uffer to come within a quarter of a mile of him
without attacking them. They have only a chattering note, which they utter with
great vehemence all the time they are fighting.&mdash;When their young are
flown they are as peaceable as other birds." 
<BIBL>CATESBY.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>. But it is
di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by its red crown, and the manner of placing its ne&s;t,
which is left entirely expo&s;ed in the &s;hrubs or bu&s;hes; whereas the
Pipiri con|ceals its ne&s;t, or even lodges it in the holes of trees. It is
nearly of the &s;ame &s;ize as the Great Pipiri: its bill &s;eems le&s;s
hooked: Cate&s;by &s;ays only <HI>that it is broad, flat, and tapering.</HI>
The red <PB N="470" REF="518"> &s;pot on the upper-part of its head is very
bril|liant, and is encircled with black feathers, which conceal it when they
are clo&s;ed.&mdash;This bird ap|pears in Virginia and Carolina about the month
of April; there breeds, and departs in the be|ginning of winter.</P>
<P>A bird &s;ent to the King's cabinet, under the name of
<HI>Loui&s;iana Tyrant,</HI> appears to be exactly the &s;ame with the Carolina
Tyrant of Cate&s;by. It is larger than the fifth &s;pecies, or Cayenne Tyrant,
and almo&s;t equal to the Great Pipiri of St. Domingo. An a&s;h-colour,
almo&s;t black, is &s;pread over all the upper-part of the body, from the crown
of the head to the end of the tail, which terminates in a &s;mall white bar
&s;haped into fe&s;toons; light whiti&s;h waves are inter|mixed in the &s;mall
quills of the wing; &s;ome &s;mall &s;treaks of deep orange, inclined to red,
&s;hine through the blacki&s;h quills on the top of the head; the throat is of
a pretty pure white, which is &s;haded with black on the brea&s;t, and again
becomes &s;nowy from the &s;tomach as far as the tail.<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">The Carolina Tyrant builds its ne&s;t with wool and mo&s;s, and
lines it with fibrous roots. It lays five eggs, which are white, with ru&s;ty
&s;pots.</NOTE></P>

<P>This Tyrant, called <HI>Bentaveo</HI> at Buenos-Ayres, whence
it was brought by Commer&s;on, and <HI>Pitangua-guacu</HI> by the people of
Brazil, has been de&s;cribed by Marcgrave<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<Q REND="inline">"The Pitangua-guacu of the Brazilians,
Bemtere of the Portu|gue&s;e, is equal in bulk to the Stare; has a bill thick,
broad, pyra|midal, &s;omewhat more than an inch long, &s;harpened exteriorly;
its head compre&s;&s;ed, and broadi&s;h; its neck &s;hort, which it contracts
when &s;itting. Its body is nearly two inches and a half long; its tail
broadi&s;h, and three inches long; its legs and feet are brown. Its head, the
upper-part of its neck, the whole of its back, its wings, and its tail, are of
a blacki&s;h brown, mixed with a very little greeni&s;h. The lower-part of its
neck, its brea&s;t, and its lower-belly, have yellow feathers; the upper-part,
however, near the head, has a little crown of white. From below the throat to
the origin of the bill is white. It calls with a loud voice. Some of the&s;e
birds have a yellow &s;pot on the top of the head; &s;ome have it partly
yellow; they are called by the Brazilians, Cuiriri. In every other re&s;pect
they are like the <HI>Pitangua-Guacu.</HI>" 
<BIBL>MARC|GRAVE.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>. He makes it of the
&s;ize of the Stare (we will ob&s;erve that it is thicker, and more bulky); and
repre&s;ents its bill as thick, broad, and pyramidal, its edges &s;harp, and
more than an inch long; its head bulky; its neck &s;hort; the head, the top of
its neck, the whole of its back, its wings, and its tail, of a blacki&s;h

white, and al&s;o the little bar on the eye; the brea&s;t and belly yellow; and
the &s;mall quills of the wings fringed with ru&s;ty colour. Marcgrave adds,
that &s;ome of the&s;e birds have an orange &s;pot on the crown of the head,
and others a yellow one. The Brazilians call the&s;e <HI>Cuiriri;</HI> and in
every other property they are &s;imilar to the <HI>Pitangua-guacu.</HI> Seba
applies the name <HI>Cuiriri</HI> to a &s;pecies entirely different.</P>

gray and white, intermixed with &s;ome ru&s;ty lines on the wings, compo&s;e
its varied plumage; white predominates on the under &s;urface of the body,
where it is &s;prinkled with long blacki&s;h &s;pots; the blacki&s;h, on the
other hand, is the prevailing colour on the back, where the white forms only
&s;ome edgings. Two white lines run obliquely, the one over the eyes, the other
below them; &s;mall blacki&s;h feathers half conceal the yellow &s;pot on the
crown of the head. The feathers of the tail, which are black in the middle,
have broad borders of rufous; the hind nail is the &s;tronge&s;t of
all.&mdash;The <HI>Caudec</HI> haunts the creeks, and perches on the low
branches of trees, feed|ing probably upon aquatic in&s;ects. It is le&s;s
fre|quent than the <HI>Titiri,</HI> but has the &s;ame audacity and cruelty. In
the female, the yellow &s;pot is wanting on the head; and in &s;ome males that
&s;pot is orange, a difference which is perhaps owing to the age.</P>

<P>Though nomenclators have cla&s;&s;ed this bird with the
Flycatchers, it appears to differ widely both from the&s;e, and from the
Moucherolles; we have therefore &s;eparated it entirely, and a&s;&s;igned it
the name of <HI>Drongo,</HI> which it receives in Madaga&s;car. Its characters
are: 1. Its bulk, being larger than the Blackbird, and thicker: 2. The tuft on
the origin of the bill: 3. Its bill is not &s;o flat: 4. The tar&s;us and toes
are very &s;trong. All its plumage is black, varying with green; directly under
the root of the upper|mandible &s;ome long and very narrow feathers ri&s;e
erect to the height of an inch and eight lines; they bend forward, and make a
very odd &s;ort of cre&s;t; the two outer-quills of the tail project an inch
and &s;even lines beyond the two middle ones; the others are of an intermediate
length, and diverge, which occa&s;ions the tail to be very forked. Commer&s;on
a&s;&s;ures us, that the Drongo has a plea&s;ant warble, which he com|pares to
the &s;ong of the Nightingale; and this makes a wide difference from the
Tyrants, which have all &s;hrill cries, and are be&s;ides natives of America.
This Drongo was fir&s;t brought from <PB N="479" REF="527"> Madaga&s;car by
Poivre; it has al&s;o come from the Cape of Good Hope, and from China. We have
remarked that the cre&s;t is wanting in &s;ome &s;pecimens, and we have no
doubt that the bird &s;ent to the Royal cabinet under the name of <HI>the
Forked-tail Flycatcher of China,</HI> belongs to this &s;pecies, and is perhaps
a female; the re&s;em|blance, if we except the cre&s;t, being entire be|tween
this Chine&s;e bird and the Drongo.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a kind of Drongo found on the Malabar coa&s;t,
whence it was &s;ent by Sonnerat: it is rather larger than that of
Madaga&s;car, or that of China; its plumage is wholly black, but its bill is
&s;tronger and thicker; it has not the cre&s;t; and what the mo&s;t
di&s;tingui&s;hes it are, the two long &s;hafts which project from the ends of
the two outer-quills of the tail; they are almo&s;t bare for &s;ix inches of
their length, and have webs near their extremities as at their origin. We are
