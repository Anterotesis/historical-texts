<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> DARNLEY <HI>and Sir</HI> GEORGE GAUNTLET.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>AND &s;o, Darnley, you prefer this &s;olitary life, to all the joys of London&mdash;to be &s;ure you've a nice &s;nug Villa, and a charming wife here&mdash;but its dull&mdash;the &s;cene tires&mdash;it wants variety, Harry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Darnley.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir George.&mdash;Since I retir'd to this peaceful &s;pot, I have not had a wi&s;h be|yond it: I've been &s;o happy in that humble cottage, that when I'm doom'd to leave it, the world will be a wa&s;te, and life not have a charm!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>How you are alter'd, Darnley? When we were brother officers you were the greate&s;t rake in the regiment; but from the
<PB N="2" REF="9">time we were quarter'd at Worce&s;ter, where you fir&s;t beheld Mi&s;s Dormer&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Darnley.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;aw the folly of my former life; I own'd the power of her &s;uperior charms, and leaving a bu&s;y and tumultuous world, retir'd with her to this &s;eque&s;ter'd &s;cene&mdash;'tis now three years &s;ince I married.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>And from that time to this, have you liv'd in this out-of-the-way place?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Darnley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: and till you ye&s;terday honour'd me with a vi&s;it, I have not &s;een a friend within my doors&mdash;but isn't it a happy life, Sir George? Our affections have room to &s;hoot&mdash;care and di&s;tru&s;t are bani&s;h'd from our cottage, and with &s;uch a woman as Mrs. Darnley to con|ver&s;e with, what is the world to me? I can defy and &s;corn its malice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>She's an angelic creature indeed, Darnley: and at Worce&s;ter, I had my&s;elf near|ly fallen a victim to her charms; but about your future life&mdash;do you mean to live for ever in the&s;e woods and meadows?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Darnley.</SPEAKER>
<P>No&mdash;would to heaven I could!&mdash;I fear I mu&s;t forego my pre&s;ent calm, and mix in active life again: When I married, I &s;old my commi&s;&s;ion, you remember, to purcha&s;e this &s;mall farm&mdash;Mrs. Darnley's portion was but a trifle, and an encrea&s;ing family has &s;o enlarg'd my expences, that unle&s;s I return to the army&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah&mdash;you want to be raking again?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Darnley.</SPEAKER>
<P>No&mdash;I want to &s;ecure an indepen|dence for my family&mdash;I want to &s;ee my chil|dren affluent, and to attain this, I have once more applied to my uncle Sir Paul Perpetual,
<PB N="3" REF="10">who was &s;o offended at my &s;elling out, that he has ever &s;ince abandon'd me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>What&mdash;does the old beau &s;till per&s;evere in his re&s;entment?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Darnley.</SPEAKER>
<P>His anger has encreas'd; for he writes me word; he intends marrying Lady Sa|rah Savage, on purpo&s;e to have heirs more worthy his e&s;tate:&mdash;Oh! my friend:&mdash;'tis hard, that fortune &s;hould be&s;tow &s;uch trea&s;ures, and then compel me to de&s;ert them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it is: but now I think on't, this Lady Sarah Savage and her brother are my intimate friends; and as you are their neighbours, I'll introduce you and Mrs. Darn|ley to their notice&mdash;When are they expected from town?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Darnley.</SPEAKER>
<P>To day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then we'll pay them a vi&s;it: Lady Sarah Savage &s;hall interfere with your uncle, and if that fails, her brother can ea&s;ily en&s;ure your promotion in the army&mdash;but &s;ee; here's Mrs. Darnley?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Darnley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look at her, Sir George&mdash;do you, can you blame me?&mdash;who would not act as I have done?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir George.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would by heav'ns!&mdash;I'd live with her in a hermitage!&mdash;die with her on a pilgrimage!&mdash;I'd&mdash;&s;death: if I don't mind, I &s;hall di&s;cover all.</P>
