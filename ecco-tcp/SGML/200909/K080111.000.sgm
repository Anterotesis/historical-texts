<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS the in&s;tructions which are included in the following &s;heets, promi&s;e to be of mo&s;t utility to the unexpe|rienced collector in the form of pocket a&s;&s;i&s;tant, to which he may occa&s;ionally re&s;ort for information, we have en|deavoured to dive&s;t them of whatever appeared in the &s;malle&s;t degree &s;uperfluous to that de&s;ign; at the &s;ame time that we were careful to avoid unnece&s;&s;ary brevity, or pa&s;&s;ing &s;ilently over tho&s;e particulars which required to be placed in a per&s;picuous point of view.</P>
<P>We have to ob&s;erve as an apology for its publication, that the treati&s;e on the management of in&s;ects, and the in|&s;tructions for the pre&s;ervation of birds, appear at the ex|pre&s;s reque&s;t of many &s;ub&s;cribers to our Natural Hi&s;tories, and that we have only exceeded their &s;olicitations by add|ing what relates to the pre&s;ervation of animals, &s;hells, corals, and other natural productions; &s;uch addition ap|pearing to us likely to render the volume more acceptable to the early naturali&s;t, who&s;e enquiries are not confined to the &s;tudy of birds, or the &s;cience of entomology.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the practical part of tho&s;e in&s;tructions, it will not be expected that the natural attitude of an ani|mal, a bird, or an in&s;ect, can be given &s;o well by an un|&s;kilful operator as by a profe&s;&s;ional man, who is in con|&s;tant practice, it mu&s;t rather be inferred that by due at|tention to the information we have given, he may en&s;ure their pre&s;ervation from the ravages of tho&s;e de&s;tructive mites, and the larvae of minute beetles or moths which breed among the feathers of birds, the hair of animals, or down of in&s;ects, and would de&s;troy them in the cour&s;e of a few &s;ummer months, unle&s;s prevented by timely pre|cautions.</P>
<P><PB REF="3">Although we have found it nece&s;&s;ary to treat of in&s;ects in a more exten&s;ive manner than of any other &s;ubject in the work, we have principally confined our attention to the practical part, without entering into any particulars re|lative to their &s;cientific arrangement in the cabinet; for however &s;uch a digre&s;&s;ion might a&s;&s;i&s;t the &s;tudent, it would not only be foreign to our de&s;ign, but render the whole too voluminous and expen&s;ive for general accomodation.</P>
<P>A practical and &s;cientific knowledge of in&s;ects, are &s;o intimately connected with each other, that a competent knowledge of the former mu&s;t be combined with the lat|ter, before any con&s;iderable proficiency can be acquired; the inexperienced entomologi&s;t mu&s;t not re&s;t &s;atisfied with the pre&s;erved &s;pecimens in his cabinet, he mu&s;t attend carefully to their manners, peculiar po&s;itions, and many other circum&s;tances in a living &s;tate, before he can attempt to a&s;certain the &s;pecies, or even genus of many kinds.</P>
<P>Many other advantages will re&s;ult to per&s;ons of that de|&s;cription, from a minute ob&s;ervance of in&s;ects in a living &s;tate, but as we care not to expatiate on what may be al|ready known to them, we &s;hall conclude with ob&s;erving, that as every per&s;on, who may feel an inclination to ap|propriate a few of his lei&s;ure hours to the &s;tudy of entomo|logy, cannot have an opportunity to procure the ne|ce&s;&s;ary in&s;tructions, and tho&s;e e&s;pecially who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s, or concerns, require their re&s;idence in a di&s;tant part of the country, we conceive that the pre&s;ent treati&s;e will not be unacceptable; we &s;ubmit it to the candid peru&s;al of tho&s;e, who&s;e exertions in practical entomology it is mo&s;t likely to a&s;&s;i&s;t, but tru&s;t that among the variety of other in&s;truc|tions which are concentrated from the be&s;t authorities, at lea&s;t &s;ome will be found u&s;eful to every cla&s;s of natural hi&s;tory collectors.</P>

<HEAD>THE PRESERVATION OF ANIMALS AND BIRDS.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH Quadrupedes con&s;titute one of the mo&s;t impor|tant divi&s;ions of Natural Hi&s;tory, we have &s;carcely any col|lection in this country that includes more than a very partial &s;elec|tion of the &s;malle&s;t kinds; indeed the many un&s;urmountable difficul|ties which would offer to a collector in this department, independent of an immen&s;e expence, will ever deter the mo&s;t affluent, from an attempt that mu&s;t be ultimately un&s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>Collections of Birds are more frequent both in the living and pre|&s;erved &s;tate; they are more engaging in appearance, and require le&s;s expence and trouble.</P>
<P>The following rules may be u&s;eful to the curious traveller, if he has any de&s;ire to pre&s;erve &s;ome of the rare &s;pecimens either of
<PB N="2" REF="5">Animals or Birds that he may meet with in foreign countries; and &s;hould he even want experience enough to give them their proper attitudes, he may pre&s;erve them free from injury, and tran&s;mit them from one part of the world to another without any apprehen&s;ion of depredation by In&s;ects.</P>
<P><HI>Precautions to be ob&s;erved.</HI></P>
<P>Provide a quantity of allum, ar&s;enic, camphire, &s;ulphur, and warm &s;pices; tobacco, tanners bark, bitter aloes, and &s;pirit of wine; &s;ome cotton, wool, fine tow, and oakum.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>ANIMALS</HEAD>
<P>MUST be entirely dive&s;ted of the fle&s;h; fir&s;t open the &s;kin with a pair of &s;harp-pointed &s;ci&s;&s;ars, in a &s;trait direction from the vent to the throat, and take away all the in&s;ide, &s;coop out the brains, take away the eyes, and with the &s;ci&s;&s;ars cut off whatever fle&s;h you can from within the head, as the tongue, &amp;c., but leave the &s;kull; during this operation be careful to pre&s;erve the mouth, &s;nout, feet, and claws perfect, and if any blood, or &s;limy matter adheres to the hair, wa&s;h it off with a &s;ponge and warm water: the &s;kin mu&s;t then be laid on a flat board, or table, and rubbed on the in&s;ide with &s;ome compo&s;ition liquor, or powder, until it feels perfectly dry under the hand. The liquor is thus prepared:</P>
<P>Di&s;&s;olve &s;ome camphire in a quantity of &s;pirit of wine, and thereto add a proportion of burnt-allum and &s;ulphur; to one ounce of the camphire that is di&s;&s;olved in the &s;pirit of wine, put</P>
<P>Half a pound of burnt-allum, and</P>
<P>One ounce of &s;ulphur.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="6">Or of Tanners bark well dried and powdered two parts,</P>
<P>Tobacco highly dried one part, and</P>
<P>Burnt-allum one part; fir&s;t bake the allum to a cake on a &s;hovel, and reduce it to a fine powder.</P>
<P>Add to every pound of tho&s;e ingredients,
<LIST>
<ITEM>One ounce of ar&s;enic,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Ditto camphire,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Half an ounce of &s;ulphur.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Either of tho&s;e compo&s;itions may be prepared at lei&s;ure, and kept always fit for u&s;e, if the bottles in which they are pre&s;erved are well corked.</P>
<P><HI>Colonel Davies</HI> advi&s;es, to prepare the mixture with a double pro|portion of burnt-allum, and to add one ounce of bitter aloes.</P>
<P>Introduce a &s;trong wire frame to a&s;&s;i&s;t in giving the attitude, or to &s;upport the animal in a &s;tanding po&s;ition; then &s;tuff the &s;kin either with tow, wool, or cotton, according to the &s;ize of the Ani|mal, but be very cautious not to di&s;tend the &s;kin in any part &s;o as to give it an unnatural appearance: it will be better to mea&s;ure the exact proportion of every part before you take off the &s;kin.</P>
<P>The eyes are made of gla&s;s, and may be purcha&s;ed at the gla&s;s|bead manufactories, of any &s;ize or colour; black are tho&s;e which &s;uit mo&s;t &s;ubjects, but if it &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary to have only a black, or dark &s;peek in the centre of a white bead, it can be blown with a pipe to a proper &s;ize on the bead, or painted with oil colour; how|ever, to prevent ob&s;tacles, it will be mo&s;t advi&s;able for travellers to purcha&s;e a complete a&s;&s;ortment.&mdash;<HI>Note.</HI> Open the eye-lids very wide, and introduce the bead into the &s;ocket, the bead mu&s;t be &s;ome|what
<PB N="4" REF="7">larger than the true eye, that it may fill up the &s;pace; then draw together the eye-lids and adju&s;t them &s;o as to leave a proper opening.</P>
<P>For convenience, the Animal may be tran&s;ported from the <HI>Indies,</HI> or any di&s;tant part of the world, and the intended attitude may be given after it has arrived, only be careful to pack it up in a clo&s;e box with a quantity of tobacco and camphire.</P>
<P>But the be&s;t and mo&s;t expeditious method, if the &s;ize of the Ani|mal will permit, is to plunge it into a bottle or barrel of &s;pirits; in this manner it will retain the &s;ize and proportions infinitely bet|ter, than what the utmo&s;t &s;kill of man can imitate, by any attempt to &s;tuff the &s;kins only. <HI>Ob&s;erve</HI> to cover the mouths of the bottles with tin foil, or with a compo&s;ition of melted re&s;in and borax.</P>
<P>Experiments have been made to pre&s;erve the &s;kins of Animals, with part of their fle&s;h and bones within, &s;o as to give the exact di|men&s;ions of the living creature; for this purpo&s;e they are opened as before de&s;cribed, the entrails taken out, with all the fle&s;h that can conveniently be cut away; the brains, eyes, tongue, &amp;c.; al&s;o cut off the fle&s;h on the &s;ides of the ribs as low as po&s;&s;ible and &s;crape the bones, then rub the &s;kin well with the preparing powder, and fill up every vacant part with the &s;ame compo&s;ition, of burnt-allum, tanners bark, &amp;c. as before de&s;cribed; but add &s;ome wool and cot|ton, or tow, which has been &s;teeped in &s;pirit of wine and camphire; then &s;ew up the opening. It mu&s;t after this preparation be baked in a &s;lack oven, but the heat mu&s;t be &s;o exactly tempered as not to &s;corch the hair.</P>

<HEAD>BIRDS.</HEAD>
<P>THE different methods of pre&s;erving Birds perfectly agree in mo&s;t re&s;pects with tho&s;e for the pre&s;ervation of Animals; only as they are generally &s;maller, they are more difficult to prepare, and a greater number of in&s;truments will be required.</P>
<P>Provide a quantity of different &s;ized wires, if nealed it will be be&s;t; a variety of coloured gla&s;s beads, tho&s;e which are black may have artificial irides painted on them, and will &s;uit many &s;ubjects; a blunt pen will do very well to take away the brains with, if the Bird is &s;mall; but large &s;pecimens will require a &s;mall &s;coop; a pair of nippers, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in taking out the entrails; wire clippers, &s;mall awls, &s;mall files, knives, &s;ci&s;&s;ars, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Open the Bird along the brea&s;t, (if nece&s;&s;ary from the vent to the throat) and &s;eparate the &s;kin on each &s;ide from the fle&s;h, take out the entrails, &amp;c.; then proceed to cut out the fle&s;h, and &s;o much of the bones as you can conveniently; or it will be better to take off the &s;kin, and only leave the bones of the head and thighs; &s;coop out the brains, eyes, tongue, roof of the mouth, &amp;c. and &s;trew the &s;kin with pre&s;erving powder; introduce two &s;tout wires (according to the &s;ize of the Bird), which have been &s;harpened at their points, through the &s;oles of the feet, up the legs, and clo&s;e to the brea&s;t; leave an inch or more without the feet, when you cut off the wires: at the ends which reach the brea&s;t the wires are interwoven with three others, one whereof pa&s;&s;es up the neck, and through the head and no&s;tril, where it mu&s;t be cut off, or filed &s;mooth; the others pa&s;s one
<PB N="6" REF="9">into each wing: two more are united to tho&s;e in their de&s;cent, and are pa&s;&s;ed into the tail. Thus prepared the in&s;ide mu&s;t be &s;trewed with the pre&s;erving powder, and filled with fine dry tow, or cotton, (and &s;ome mo&s;s if convenient.) <HI>Ob&s;erve,</HI> that if the &s;tuffing has been before &s;teeped in &s;pirit of wine, it will be better; and you may put a quantity of mu&s;k, or camphire, into the body with the tow.</P>
<P>Begin at the vent with your needle and &s;ilk, and as you &s;ew up the &s;kin add as much &s;tuffing as the &s;kin will bear without tearing; pa&s;s your needle from the in&s;ide outwards, which will prevent the feathers being in the way. When you have entirely clo&s;ed the opening lay the feathers &s;mooth on the brea&s;t, &s;o as to conceal the &s;ewing; then introduce the eyes into the &s;ockets. The two pieces of wire which are left through the &s;oles of the feet are intended to fix it in the ca&s;e; if you mean to have it perched on a &s;tump, or branch, you are to make a hole through the wood, and pa&s;s tho&s;e wires through. The Birds mu&s;t be baked in a &s;lack oven until all the moi&s;ture is exhaled; the proper degree of heat may be known by putting a feather into the oven; if it is &s;corched, or curled up, the heat is too great.</P>
<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="plate">
<HEAD>PLATE I. FIG. 1.</HEAD>
<P>To a&s;&s;i&s;t the de&s;cription we have added a Plate of the wire frame, u&s;ed in &s;tuffing a &s;mall &s;pecimen of the Bittern, or Heron tribe; mo&s;t other kinds may have the wire frame con&s;tructed in a &s;imilar manner.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve, that the crevices in the ca&s;es which are to receive the Birds, are to be &s;topped up with <HI>plai&s;ter of Paris,</HI> &s;o as to entirely exclude all external air; and when the fronts are glazed, do not omit to put a quantity of camphire into each ca&s;e, as that alone will greatly

If at any time you di&s;cover fragments of feathers at the bottom of the ca&s;e, it is a &s;ign of the depredations of in&s;ects, and do not delay to open the ca&s;e, and burn a quantity of &s;ulphur in it for an hour or more; this will in mo&s;t circum&s;tances de&s;troy the in|&s;ects until the following &s;ea&s;on, and no way injure the Bird; but &s;hould it prove in&s;ufficient, bake-them as before, and the larvae of the in&s;ects will be inevitably de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>Birds are &s;ometimes pre&s;erved in &s;pirits, during a voyage; in this ca&s;e, it is proper to wrap each &s;ubject up in a piece of fine linen, to prevent their receiving any injury, either by rubbing again&s;t one another, or the &s;ides of the ve&s;&s;els which contain them.</P>
<P>The legs of many Birds fade immediately after death, the beak is liable to the &s;ame change; and &s;ome have caruncles, or fle&s;hy protuberances, which al&s;o lo&s;e colour, as the neck of the Ca&s;&s;owary, wattles of the Cock, neck of the Golden Vulture, &amp;c. all tho&s;e de|fects mu&s;t be remedied by painting the parts, as near as po&s;&s;ible to the natural hue, with oil colours.</P>
<P>The natives of the <HI>Papau I&s;lands,</HI> it is reported, have a peculiar method of pre&s;erving the &s;kins of the le&s;&s;er Birds of Paradi&s;e; they take out the entrails, &s;ear their in&s;ides with a red-hot iron, and put them into hollow pieces of <HI>bamboo.</HI> Similar practices on Birds of this, or other countries, will perhaps render it very nece&s;&s;ary, when &s;tuffed &s;pecimens are received, to examine whether a quantity of the fle&s;h is contained within the &s;kin, and if &s;uch fle&s;h has not been properly prepared, it &s;hould be immediately cleared away; for this purpo&s;e wrap the Bird in a wet cloth, and let it remain
<PB N="8" REF="12">therein for two or three hours; it will be &s;o much relaxed by this treatment that it may be opened and the fle&s;h taken away.</P>
<P>It may be al&s;o relaxed by holding it a few minutes over the &s;team of boiling water, or by being put into the earth and covered over for a few hours. It is a practice with &s;eamen to &s;tuff the &s;kins of Ani|mals and Birds with &s;aw-du&s;t, which an&s;wers very well for their pre|&s;ervation during a voyage, but if permitted to remain within the &s;kin for any con&s;iderable time after, it may &s;erve as a <HI>nidus</HI> for In|fects, which, being hatched, will entirely devour the &s;kin and fea|thers, or hair.</P>
<P>If you wi&s;h to pre&s;erve the ne&s;t and eggs, it will only be nece&s;&s;ary to blow out the contents of the eggs, and fa&s;ten them into the ne&s;t with gum or glue.</P>

<P>Some &s;pecies of Reptiles, and a few of Fi&s;hes, may be pre&s;erved by opening them, and taking out all the in&s;ide, then being &s;trewed with the pre&s;erving powder, and filled with tow; after which they &s;hould be covered with two or three coats of copal varni&s;h.</P>

<P>Antient writers were not acquainted with the transformations of Infects, as appears very plainly by the erroneous &s;uppo&s;itions gene|rally entertained; neither was the my&s;tery entirely explained till the latter end of the la&s;t century, when <HI>Malpighi</HI> and <HI>Swammerdam</HI> made ob&s;ervations and experiments on Infects, under every appear|ance, and by di&s;&s;ecting them ju&s;t preceding their changes, were en|abled to prove, that the Moth and Butterfly grow and &s;trengthen them&s;elves, and that their members are formed and unfolded, under the figure of the Infect we call Caterpillar.</P>

<HEAD>THE EGG.</HEAD>
<P>THE eggs of an In&s;ect are always &s;mall, compared with the &s;ize of the In&s;ect it&s;elf; they vary in number and figure in different &s;pecies; &s;ome are round, others oval; &s;ome are cylindrical, and others nearly &s;quare; the &s;hells of &s;ome are hard and &s;mooth, while others are &s;oft and flexible. It is a rule, but is not invariable, that the eggs never encrea&s;e in &s;ize after they are laid.</P>
<P>They are found of almo&s;t every &s;hade of colour, and are always di&s;po&s;ed in tho&s;e &s;ituations where the young brood may find a convenient &s;upply of proper food; &s;ome In&s;ects depo&s;it their eggs in the oak-leaf, producing there the red gall; others cau&s;e a &s;imilar appearance on the poplar-leaf, and the red protuberances on the willow-leaf, and the termination of the juniper branches are pro|duced by like means: the leaves of &s;ome plants are drawn into a globular head by the eggs of an In&s;ect lodged therein; and many curious circum&s;tances relative to this oeconomy might be noticed if the nature of our plan would permit.</P>
<P>The Phryganea, Libellula, Gnat, Ephemera, &amp;c. hover all day over the water to depo&s;it their eggs, which are hatched in the water, and remain there all the time they are in the larva form. Many Moths cover their eggs with a thick bed of hair which they gather from their bodies, and others cover them with a glutinous compo&s;i|tion, which, when dry, protects them from moi&s;ture, rain, and cold; and the Wolf-Spider carefully pre&s;erves its eggs in a &s;ilk bag, which it carries on its back: by &s;ome Moths they are glued with great &s;ymmetry round the &s;maller branches of trees, or are &s;ecreted beneath the bark, and frequently in the crevices of walls, in hollow &s;talks, &amp;c.</P>

<P>ALL Caterpillars are hatched from the egg, and when they fir&s;t proceed from it are &s;mall and feeble, but their &s;trength increa&s;es in proportion with their &s;ize; a di&s;tingui&s;hing character of the Cater|pillar of a Lepidopterous In&s;ect is not having le&s;s than eight, or more than &s;ixteen feet.</P>
<P>The Caterpillar, who&s;e life is one continued &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of changes, moults its &s;kin &s;everal times before it attains its full growth; tho&s;e changes are the more &s;ingular as it is not &s;imply the &s;kin which is ca&s;t off; but with the exuviae we find the &s;kull, the jaws, and all the exterior parts, both &s;caly and membranaceous, which com|po&s;e the lips, antennae, palpi, and even tho&s;e cru&s;taceous pieces within the head, which &s;erve as a fixed ba&s;is to a number of mu&s;cles, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The new organs are under the old ones, as in a &s;heath, &s;o that the Caterpillar effects its change by withdrawing from the old &s;kin when it finds it inadequate to its bulk.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Caterpillars who live in &s;ociety, and have a ne&s;t, retire there to ca&s;t their exuviae; fixing the hooks of their feet firmly in the web during the operation. Some of the &s;olitary &s;pecies &s;pin at this time a &s;lender web, to which they affix them&s;elves. A day or two before the critical moment for its moulting, the In&s;ect cea&s;es to eat, and lo&s;es its u&s;ual activity, the colours gradually become weaker and the Caterpillar more feeble, the &s;kin hardens and withers, the
<PB N="17" REF="20">creature lifts up its back, &s;tretches it&s;elf to the utmo&s;t extent, &s;ome|times elevates its head, moving it a little from one &s;ide to another, and &s;uddenly letting it fall again; near the change, the &s;econd and third rings are &s;een to &s;well con&s;iderably; and by repeated exertions a &s;lit is made on the back, generally beginning on the &s;econd or third ring: through this divi&s;ion the new &s;kin may be ju&s;t perceived by the brightne&s;s of its colours; the creature pre&s;&s;es through like a wedge, and thereby &s;eparates the &s;kin from the fir&s;t to the fourth ring, which &s;ufficiently enlarges the aperture to admit the Cater|pillar through.</P>
<P>The Caterpillar commonly fa&s;ts a whole day each time after re|peating this operation: &s;ome Caterpillars in changing their &s;kins, from &s;mooth, become covered with hair; while others, that were covered with hair, have their la&s;t &s;kins &s;mooth.</P>
<P>The food of Caterpillars is chiefly or entirely of the vegetable kind. The larvae<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Larva</HI> is a term u&s;ually applied to the &s;econd &s;tate of all In&s;ects, except tho&s;e of Moths and Butterflies, which are called Caterpillars.</NOTE> of Beetles live under the &s;urface of the earth, and prey upon &s;maller In&s;ects, on the roots and tender fibrils of plants, or on filthy matter in general; indeed in the la&s;t &s;tate beetles are mo&s;t commonly found in putrid fle&s;h, or in the excrements of animals.</P>
<P>When the Caterpillar has attained its full &s;ize, and all the parts of the future Moth, or Butterfly, are &s;ufficiently formed beneath the &s;kin, it prepares to change into the chry&s;alis or pupa &s;tate; &s;ome &s;pin webs, or cones, in which they enclo&s;e them&s;elves; others de|&s;cend into the earth and conceal them&s;elves in little cells which they form in the light loo&s;e mould; &s;ome are &s;u&s;pended by a girdle which
<PB N="18" REF="21">pa&s;&s;es round the body, and is fa&s;tened to the &s;mall twigs of trees; and Caterpillars of Butterflies connect them&s;elves by their po&s;terior extremity to the &s;talks or leaves of plants with their head down|wards.</P>
<P>The length of time In&s;ects live in the &s;tate of Caterpillars is al|ways the &s;ame in each individual &s;pecies, yet very few &s;pecies pre|ci&s;ely agree to the &s;ame period for their changes; &s;ome live two or three years, others only a few months, or even weeks, before they pa&s;s to the pupa or chry&s;alis &s;tate.</P>
<P>Preparatory to the change, the Caterpillar cea&s;es to take any of its food, empties it&s;elf of all the excrementitious matter that is con|tained in the inte&s;tines, voiding at the &s;ame time the membrane which &s;erved as a lining to the&s;e, and the &s;tomach; and per&s;everes in a &s;tate of inactivity for &s;everal days. At length, by a proce&s;s &s;imilar to its former moulting, the outer &s;kin, or &s;lough, is ca&s;t off, and the creature thus dive&s;ted of its la&s;t &s;kin is what we call the Chry&s;alis.</P>

<HEAD>PUPA, CHRYSALIS, OR AURELIA.</HEAD>
<P>THE words Aurelia or Chry&s;alis are equally u&s;ed to expre&s;s that inactive &s;tate which en&s;ues after the Caterpillar has changed, for the great purpo&s;e of preparing for the <HI>Imago,</HI> or transformation to the Fly. Aurelia, is derived from the Latin <HI>aurum,</HI> and Chry&s;alis from the Greek, and are both intended to &s;ignify a creature formed of gold; this however is giving a general title, from a very partial circum&s;tance, as the colour of a con&s;iderable number are black, or dark brown, while the re&s;plendence of gold is only &s;een on the Chry&s;alides of a few &s;pecies of the Papilio, or Butterfly. The term Chry&s;alis &s;hould therefore be u&s;ed to &s;ignify only tho&s;e of the Butter|fly kind, and Pupa for the Phalaenae, or Moths, as well as tho&s;e of Sphinxes, or Hawk Moths.</P>
<P>That very intelligent naturali&s;t M. de <HI>Reaumur</HI> explains the cau&s;e of this brilliant appearance; it proceeds from two &s;kins, the upper one a beautiful brown, which covers a highly-poli&s;hed &s;mooth white &s;kin: the light reflected from the la&s;t, in pa&s;&s;ing through the upper|mo&s;t, communicates this bright golden yellow, in the &s;ame manner as this colour is often given to leather, &s;o that the whole appears gilded, although no gold enters into that tincture.</P>
<P>The exterior part of the Pupa is at fir&s;t exceedingly tender, &s;oft, and partly tran&s;parent, being covered with a thick vi&s;cous &s;luid, but which drying forms a new covering for the animal.</P>
<P>The time each In&s;ect remains in this &s;tate is very ea&s;ily a&s;certained by tho&s;e who once breed them, as they always remain the &s;ame &s;pace

(Heart Moth)</HI> remained from the beginning of October till May following; and many &s;pecies remain a very con&s;iderable time longer than this.</P>
<P>When the In&s;ect has acquired a &s;uitable degree of &s;olidity and &s;trength, it endeavours to free it&s;elf from the ca&s;e in which it is confined; and as it adheres to a very few parts of the body it does not require any great exertion to &s;plit the membrane which covers it; a &s;mall degree of motion, or a little inflation of the body is &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e; the&s;e motions reiterated a few times, enlarge the opening and afford more convenience for the In&s;ect's e&s;cape; this opening is always formed a little above the trunk be|tween the wings, and a &s;mall piece which covers the head. Tho&s;e &s;pecies which &s;pin a cone, gnaw or pierce an aperture large enough for their emancipation.</P>
<P>The Moth immediately after emerging from its ca&s;e is moi&s;t, with the wings very &s;mall, thick, and crumpled; but they rapidly expand under the eye of the ob&s;erver, and in a few minutes have attained their full &s;ize; the moi&s;ture evaporates, the &s;pots on the wings, which at fir&s;t appeared confu&s;ed, become di&s;tinct, and the fibres, which were before flexible, become &s;tiff and hard as bones.</P>
<P>When the wings are unfolded, the antennae in motion, the tongue coiled up, the Moth fu&s;&s;iciently dried, and its different members &s;trengthened, it is prepared for flight. The excrementitious di&s;|charge which is voided by mo&s;t In&s;ects at this time M. de Reaumur thinks is the la&s;t they eject during their lives.</P>

<HEAD>INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS.</HEAD>
<P>INSECTS are collected in every &s;tate, though in the Caterpillar, or Chry&s;alis, they are preferred, not only as the time of their ap|pearance in the winged &s;tate may be then carefully attended to, but they will not be &s;o liable to disfigure and damage their tender mark|ings, as tho&s;e which have been in the wind or rain; and if they are taken with care from the breeding-cage immediately after their wings have attained a proper &s;ize, they may be pre&s;erved free from any injury to tho&s;e beautiful feathers, which are generally much di&s;com|po&s;ed in &s;uch In&s;ects as are taken in flight.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome which cannot be found in the Caterpillar &s;tate; or if found, cannot be provided with food; tho&s;e are generally of that kind which collectors term internal, or underground feeders, and either &s;ub&s;i&s;t on &s;ome &s;ub&s;tance unknown to us, or which we cannot raadily &s;upply. The larvae of Beetles and many other kinds of In&s;ects, are of this de&s;cription: numbers of the Moth tribe have hitherto only been taken in the Fly &s;tate, and are &s;uppo&s;ed to feed
<PB N="22" REF="27">in the night; they live in cells which they form in the earth, and come up in the evening to feed, but de&s;cend again into their cells before day-break; it is therefore that &s;ome Aurelians have &s;ought for Caterpillars by the light of a candle or lanthorn, and have been very &s;ucce&s;sful: the mo&s;t valuable in&s;ects have been di&s;covered by this means.</P>
<P>In&s;ects are found in almo&s;t every &s;ituation, the &s;ummits of the loftie&s;t trees, and the lowe&s;t herbage equally abound, and the gra|dations between &s;warm with an infinity of &s;pecies: the collector mu&s;t be therefore &s;upplied with a different apparatus, according to the &s;tate in which the In&s;ects may be found; tho&s;e in pre&s;ent u&s;e, though few and &s;imple, require very little improvement, as they an&s;wer every nece&s;&s;ary purpo&s;e.

<P>Note, This frame &s;hould not be le&s;s than four or five feet in length, when fitted together.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="28">The net is to be made of Scotch gau&s;e, not very fine, and bound entirely round with a broad welt, doubled to form a groove into which the &s;ticks are to &s;lip:&mdash;this bordering may be excepted at d d, but the gau&s;e at bottom mu&s;t be turned up about &s;ix inches and form a bag; each &s;tick or frame when the pieces are fitted together, is to pa&s;s into the groove at b b, &s;lip up to c, and be there fa&s;tened by a piece of tape through a loop or hole; let the whole be drawn tight and each &s;ide at b b be tied to the nails; the handles are to be held one in each hand, when the net is u&s;ed.</P>
<P>With this net it is intended to catch Moths on the wing, and that purpo&s;e it an&s;wers very effectually, as it may be in&s;tantly opened or folded together, and &s;ecure the In&s;ect between; even In&s;ects of the &s;malle&s;t kinds cannot e&s;cape, if the net is not damaged and the gau&s;e fine.</P>

<HEAD>CATERPILLARS.</HEAD>
<P>MOST Caterpillars lurk among the lowe&s;t herbage in the night time, begin to a&s;cend early in the morning, and about noon are found feeding on the tops of their re&s;pective plants; they de&s;cend gradually as the &s;un declines, and at the clo&s;e of the evening are again concealed in the low herbage: night feeders a&s;cend in the evening, and de&s;cend as morning approaches.</P>
<P>To collect Caterpillars it is only nece&s;&s;ary to expand the fowling|net, or a large &s;heet, under the branches, then beat them with a &s;tick or pole, and the Caterpillars will be &s;hook down with the frag|ments of the foliage and broken twigs.</P>
<P>When you have procured the Caterpillars, be particularly attentive to note the plant on which you found each &s;pecies, and &s;upply them plentifully with fre&s;h food every day of that kind; only ob&s;er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f they are moulting they mu&s;t not be di&s;turbed, or the &s;tale food be removed, but give a fre&s;h &s;upply when the creature has recovered its &s;trength.</P>

<P><PB N="27" REF="32">Doctor Lodovico Bellardi, a learned and ingenious Botani&s;t of Turin, di&s;covered, about &s;ix years ago, after a number of experi|ments, a new method of feeding Silk-worms, when they are hatched before the mulberry-trees have produced leaves, or when it happens that the fro&s;t de&s;troys the tender branches. Whether this di&s;covery may be applied with equal propriety in other in&s;tances &s;eems at pre&s;ent undertermined, though from &s;ome recent experi|ments we are inclined to believe the po&s;&s;ibility of feeding Caterpil|lars in backward &s;ea&s;ons in this manner; we have tried &s;everal Caterpillars which were nearly full fed on the leaves of thorns and oak &s;o prepared, and have ob&s;erved them to eat it when no other food was given, but cannot &s;ay how they may thrive if fed on that aliment alone. This new method con&s;i&s;ts in giving the Caterpillars the dried leaves of their u&s;ual food, powdered and moi&s;tened; and repeated experiments, &s;ays our author, prove that they (the Cater|pillars of Silk-worms) prefer it to any other, and eat it with the greate&s;t avidity. The leaves mu&s;t be gathered about the end of au|tumn, before the fro&s;t commences, in dry weather, and at times when the heat is greate&s;t. They mu&s;t be dried afterwards in the &s;un, by &s;preading them upon large cloths, and laid up in a dry place after they have been reduced to powder. When it is nece&s;&s;ary to give this powder to the Caterpillars it &s;hould be gently moi&s;tened with a little water, and a thin coat mu&s;t be placed round the young worms, which will immediately begin too feed upon it.</P>

<P>IT is in this &s;tate we find an immen&s;e quantity of In&s;ects, of who&s;e Larvae or Caterpillars we are altogether ignorant; and indeed &s;uch are the di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence to this inferior rank in the &s;cale of animated nature, that many are provided with the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, in the mo&s;t &s;ecret &s;ituations; they are hatched in the mid&s;t of plenty, and in&s;tinct prompts them not to remove from it; but when they are matured that &s;ame in&s;tinct bids them bur&s;t the &s;hackles of their bondage.</P>
<P>Such as wi&s;h to collect, &s;hould pay a proper attention to the &s;tate of the weather; if it proves fine, and the &s;un emits much warmth, In&s;ects are very bri&s;k; but if a cold or windy day it will be only a fruitle&s;s toil to attempt collecting, as all In&s;ects at &s;uch times &s;helter within the herbage, and in&s;tead of flying upward, as u&s;ual when di&s;turbed, they dart into the thicke&s;t of the underwood; or if once they ri&s;e above the bu&s;hes, they are impetuou&s;ly hurled by the current of the wind, far beyond the reach of the fowling-net.</P>
<P>"The <HI>Garden White</HI> is as good a token for fine weather as may be; when the&s;e flies are out in a morning, it &s;eldom or ever hap|pens but a fine day en&s;ues.

<P>Butterflies are abroad in the day time only; and the be&s;t time to collect Moths on the wing, is during the night, e&s;pecially an hour or two after &s;un-&s;et.</P>
<P>At day-break many In&s;ects are on the wing; and mo&s;t kinds are ob&s;erved in hot weather to come forth after rain, to enjoy the humidity of the air, which is then damp but warm.

<P>The males of &s;ome, if not of every &s;pecies of the Moth tribe, and perhaps of other In&s;ects al&s;o, by a very a&s;toni&s;hing faculty, are able to di&s;cover the females at a great di&s;tance, and in the mo&s;t &s;ecret &s;ituations; this has been before noticed by <HI>Barbut, Harris,</HI> and others; and &s;ome collectors have endeavoured to find the male In|&s;ects by this means; they enclo&s;e the living female in a breeding-box, and place it as near the u&s;ual haunts of the &s;pecies as convenient, the males will generally be ob&s;erved &s;oon after, fluttering on the box, and endeavouring to gain admi&s;&s;ion to the female. This experiment is generally practi&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s on the Fox, and Egger, Moths.</P>
<P>Every &s;pecies has a di&s;tinct time for its appearance, and this punctuality is &s;carcely forwarded or retarded a few days, except by the unu&s;ual mildne&s;s or inclemency of the &s;ea&s;on: if you di&s;cover a brood of In&s;ects at a certain time of the year, preci&s;ely or nearly at the &s;ame period of the year following, you will find a brood of the &s;ame &s;pecies; unle&s;s by accident they have been de&s;troyed.

<HEAD>THE CATERPILLAR.</HEAD>
<P>The pre&s;ervation of In&s;ects in this &s;tate, is not only one of the mo&s;t curious, but u&s;eful di&s;coveries that have been made in this de|partment of &s;cience. They may be pre&s;erved by being plunged into phials filled with well rectified &s;pirits of wine: this method &s;hould ever be preferred by tho&s;e who collect in a di&s;tant country, if their &s;ubjects are not likely to be injured by &s;uch a proce&s;s, the mo&s;t delicate Caterpillars will retain their exact &s;ize, but the &s;pirits will generally extract the colour, and from tho&s;e e&s;pecially which have very tender &s;kins.</P>
<P>But the manner in which <HI>Swammerdam</HI> pre&s;erved his Caterpillars, completely obviates this defect, and if carefully managed, it not only pre&s;erves the exact &s;ize, but generally retains the colours as per|fectly as in the living creature.</P>
<P>He u&s;ed to make a &s;mall inci&s;ion or puncture in the tail, and having very gently and with much patience pre&s;&s;ed out all the con|tained humours, injected wax into them, &s;o as to give them all the appearance of healthy living In&s;ects. In this manner he has pre&s;erved many very &s;mall &s;pecimens.</P>
<P>There is another method which is more generally known to col|lectors; it con&s;i&s;ts in taking out all the in&s;ide of the Caterpillar, and inflating the &s;kin by means of a gla&s;s tube.</P>
<P>The entrails, with whatever of the &s;le&s;hy &s;ub&s;tance can conve|niently, is drawn through the anus by means of &s;ine wire curved at the end; when the in&s;ide is emptied, the gla&s;s tube is in&s;erted
<PB N="38" REF="43">into the opening, through which the operator continues to blow while he turns the &s;kin at the end &s;lowly round over a charcoal fire; this hardens the &s;kin equally, and dries up all the moi&s;ture within; a pin is then put through it to fix it in a &s;tanding po&s;ition: if the &s;kin is tender it may be filled with white paper or cotton.</P>
<P>But this is a mo&s;t cruel operation on the little victim, and &s;uch as mu&s;t &s;hock the feelings of the human &s;oul; if therefore any other method can be introduced which will effect the purpo&s;e in a &s;hort time, the practice &s;hould be exploded as wanton barbarity.</P>
<P>Various attempts have been made, and among the&s;e &s;ome have tried to drown the Caterpillar, but you will never be able to ac|compli&s;h its death in this manner, unle&s;s it remains for a con&s;iderable time under water, and though it may appear dead, the principle of life will not be de&s;troyed. Mr. <HI>Bonnet,</HI> making experiments on the re&s;piration of In&s;ects, had one Caterpillar which lived eight days with only two of its anterior &s;piracula in the air.</P>
<P>The method we wi&s;h to recommend is to ob&s;erve when the Cater|pillar is on the point of ca&s;ting its la&s;t &s;kin; drop it by the threads into &s;calding water, and quickly withdraw it; the creature will be killed in&s;tantly; then put it into &s;ome di&s;tilled vinegar mixed with &s;pirit of wine, which will give a proper firmne&s;s to all the parts and ac|celerate the &s;eparation of the &s;kin from the body; the fle&s;h may be carefully extracted, and the exuvia or &s;kin be blown up by means of a gla&s;s tube while &s;u&s;pended over a charcoal fire, as before de|&s;cribed.</P>

<P>Tho&s;e of the <HI>Meloe</HI> genus have &s;oft tender bodies which &s;hrivel after death; to pre&s;erve tho&s;e, make an inci&s;ion at the extremity of the abdomen, probe out the entrails and fill the cavity with fine tow.</P>

<HEAD>LEPIDOPTEROUS INSECTS, AS BUTTERFLIES, HAWK-MOTHS, AND MOTHS.</HEAD>
<P>IT is u&s;ual to put two &s;pecimens of each &s;pecies of the Butterfly kind into the cabinet, one to di&s;play the upper, and the other the under &s;ide; for the under &s;ide is much more beautiful in mo&s;t &s;pecies, and differs entirely in appearance from the upper &s;ide.</P>
<P>Sphinxes and Moths are generally di&s;po&s;ed in pairs to &s;hew the male and female, and as their under &s;ides are &s;eldom very beautiful, only their upper &s;ides are &s;hewn.</P>
<P>Except a few &s;pecies, Moths con&s;tantly conceal their under wings when at re&s;t; but collectors &s;acrifice the propriety of their remain|ing in a natural po&s;ition, in order to di&s;play the under wings.&mdash;It is advi&s;able to have one of every kind in a natural po&s;ture, as that will often e&s;&s;entially a&s;&s;i&s;t to determine the family of the In&s;ect.</P>

<P>For &s;mall Moths it is only nece&s;&s;ary to put the pin through the thorax and they die in a very &s;hort time; but for larger kinds, the pin &s;hould be dipped in &s;trong aqua fortis before it is put through the In&s;ect.</P>
<P>It is very difficult to kill the large&s;t kinds of Moths and Sphinxes:&mdash;&s;elect a large pin (comparatively for the &s;ize of the In&s;ect) and dip it into aqua-fortis as before, but immediately that the pin is forced through the thorax withdraw it, and put a drop of aqua fortis into the wound; &s;hould this prove in&s;ufficient to kill it, put the point of the pin through a card, and hold it in the flame of a candle until it becomes red hot; this will kill the In&s;ect immediately, and the card will protect it from being injured by the flame.</P>
<P>The Moth is then to be fixed on the &s;etting board, and the braces are to be applied in the manner &s;hewn at FIG. 9, PLATE II. The wings are to be carefully di&s;played by means of a large pin, and the braces put clo&s;e down to prevent their return to the natural po&s;ition.&mdash;<HI>Note,</HI> All In&s;ects mu&s;t be &s;et while they remain limber, for if the parts &s;tiffen they are apt to &s;nap; they may be relaxed by floating them in a pan of water.</P>
<P>In&s;ects &s;hould remain beneath the braces on the &s;etting board until all the aqueous moi&s;ture be evaporated, or the wings will &s;tart from their po&s;ition, and the bodies turn black, or mouldy; they &s;hould be placed in a dry &s;ituation, and be covered with gau&s;e for
<PB N="44" REF="49">the admi&s;&s;ion of air for the &s;pace of a month at lea&s;t, before they are put into the cabinet.</P>
<P>It is proper in this place to caution the young beginner not to at|tempt to kill the In&s;ects by fumigations of &s;ulphur, &amp;c. a practice too frequent with per&s;ons of this de&s;cription, for &s;hould be by this means deprive the creature of its life, he will al&s;o deprive it of its beauty: It is even doubtful whether many may not &s;urvive the operation.</P>
<P>M. Lyonet placed &s;everal of the large Mu&s;k Beetles, probably the Cerambyx Mo&s;chatus, under a gla&s;s where he had been burning &s;ul|phur, and which he kept burning while they were there; and though the vapour was &s;o thick that he could not di&s;cern them, and that he kept them therein more than half an hour, they did not &s;eem in the lea&s;t incommoded<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Le&s;&s;er Theologie Des In&s;ectes.

<P>Some Moths are very liable to change colour when placed in the cabinet, and particularly tho&s;e which collectors term <HI>full-bodied;</HI> an oily matter is common to all In&s;ects, but tho&s;e are charged with a &s;uperabundance. It appears at fir&s;t in &s;pots on the body, but gradually pervades every part; in &s;ome it will even de&s;cend into the wings, and then an obliteration of all the tender marks and beautiful &s;pecklings is the lea&s;t that may be expected, if a total change of its colours, to an uniform dirty brown, does not en&s;ue. Hence it is that many of the Linnaean de&s;criptions of In|&s;ects appear defective to &s;uch as breed them; we not unfrequent|ly read, <HI>body black,</HI> though we know that part of the In&s;ect is
<PB N="45" REF="50">white in every &s;pecimen that is not grea&s;y; the body of the Satin Moth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pha. Salicis.</NOTE> is perfectly white when fine, but after it has been killed &s;ome time, it becomes black in parts; the body of the Burnet Sphinx<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sp. Filipendulae.</NOTE> is of a very brilliant blue colour, with yellow bands on every annulation, when alive, but changes to a velvety black &s;oon after the In&s;ect dies; the &s;ame is ob&s;erved on the body of the Currant Sphinx<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sp. Tipuliformis.</NOTE>; and every part of the body of the Hornet Sphinx<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Sp. Apiformis.</NOTE> changes to a jet black, after being &s;ome time in the cabinet; although when alive it is a very bright yellow, with a band of purple. Hence al&s;o it is that &s;ome &s;pecimens of very common In&s;ects are valuable, by having pre&s;erved their proper colours uninjured.</P>
<P>Various methods have been tried to extract the grea&s;e from the Moths, but a preventative &s;hould always be preferred.</P>
<P>If the grea&s;e has not &s;pread into the wings, the In&s;ect may &s;ome|times be cured, but it will be very difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to eradicate the grea&s;e which has &s;ettled in patches on the wings.</P>
<P>Large Moths are to be opened in a &s;trait line along the under &s;ide of the body, the entrails, &amp;c. taken out, and the cavity filled with fine tow or cotton.&mdash;<HI>Note,</HI> This &s;hould be performed &s;oon after the In&s;ect is dead. The mo&s;t delicate &s;pecimens may be pre&s;erved entire by this means; we have &s;ome very valuable Sphinges, Moths, &amp;c. which were collected by an intelligent per&s;on in <HI>North America;</HI> they retain their colours to the utmo&s;t degree of perfection, and have only been prevented from changing black by this &s;imple pre|paration.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="51">Sometimes it will be proper to break off the body clo&s;e at the thorax, and &s;ub&s;titute the body of another In&s;ect which nearly re|&s;embles it, and which is not &s;o liable to change.</P>
<P>The method which is mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful for recovering the original appearance after the In&s;ect has become grea&s;y, is to powder &s;ome fine dry chalk, on a piece of heated iron; cover the chalk with a very fine linen cloth, and thereto apply the under part of the body of the In|&s;ect: the heat of the iron di&s;&s;olves the grea&s;e, while the chalk ab|&s;orbs it, and the linen cloth prevents the chalk from clotting to the In&s;ect. This proce&s;s may be repeated &s;everal times if the grea&s;e is not entirely eradicated by the fir&s;t attempt. Always-ob&s;erve to exactly attemperate the heat of the iron.</P>
<P>They may be baked in a &s;lack oven, with the chalk placed to ab|&s;orb the grea&s;e, without any con&s;iderable injury to the colours.</P>

<P>Much experience, and con&s;iderable care, with a light, but &s;teady hand, are nece&s;&s;ary for the management of minute Moths on the &s;etting board; it will be equally u&s;ele&s;s and impo&s;&s;ible, to enter into a minute detail of every trivial circum&s;tance that mu&s;t be attended to, we &s;hall therefore give a general &s;ketch, and leave the re&s;t to the ingenuity of the operator.</P>

<P>The next care will be to procure pins of &s;uch a degree of finene&s;s, as not to injure or di&s;tort the wings of the In&s;ect; the &s;malle&s;t &s;ort of lace pins will do very well for mo&s;t kinds, but there are &s;ome &s;o extremely minute that even tho&s;e would be too coar&s;e. If you have pins made purpo&s;ely for In&s;ects of this kind, let them be about an inch in length, and have them drawn as fine as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>When the pin is put through the thorax it mu&s;t be managed with the greate&s;t dexterity, and be exactly in the center, as the lea&s;t va|riation to either &s;ide will break the nerves of the anterior margin of the upper wings, which will immediately &s;tart, and can never be replaced in a proper po&s;ition; if the pin is placed too high, it will &s;ever the head from the &s;houlders, and by being too low, the under wings al&s;o will break off or &s;tart from their true po&s;ition; it may be managed better with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a magnifying eye gla&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>APTEROUS INSECTS.</HEAD>
<P>MANY kinds may be pre&s;erved in &s;pirits, or in the &s;ame manner as coleopterous and other In&s;ects; but among tho&s;e we can include very few, if any, of that exten&s;ive genus ARANEA (Spiders), no method having been hitherto di&s;covered whereby they may be pre|&s;erved in their natural colours, for however beautiful they may be when alive, their bodies &s;hrivel and their teints become an ob&s;cure brown, &s;oon after death; and as the moi&s;ture exhales, the &s;ize of the body dimini&s;hes, very little more than the &s;kin of it remaining when the creature is &s;ufficiently dry to be placed in the cabinet.</P>
<P>Spiders ca&s;t their &s;kins &s;everal times in the cour&s;e of their lives; the exuviae would be very acceptable to the collector, if they re|tained any of the beautiful colours of the living Spiders.</P>
<P>To determine whether &s;ome &s;pecies of Spiders could be pre&s;erved with their natural colours, I put &s;everal into &s;pirit of wine; tho&s;e with gibbous bodies &s;oon after di&s;charged a very con&s;iderable quantity of vi&s;cid matter, and therewith all their mo&s;t beautiful colours; the &s;malle&s;t retained their form, and only appeared rather paler in the colours than when they were living.</P>
<P>During the cour&s;e of la&s;t &s;ummer, among other Spiders I met with a rare &s;pecies; it was of a bright yellow colour, elegantly marked with black, red, green, and purple; by &s;ome accident it was unfortunately cru&s;hed to pieces in the chip box wherein it was confined, and was therefore thrown a&s;ide as u&s;ele&s;s; a month or
<PB N="52" REF="57">more after that time, having occa&s;ion to open the box, I ob|&s;erved, that &s;uch parts of the &s;kin as had dried again&s;t the in|&s;ide of the box retained the original brightne&s;s of colour in a con&s;iderable degree; to further the experiment I made a &s;imilar attempt with &s;ome caution, on the body of another Spider <HI>(Aranea Diadema),</HI> and though the colours were not perfectly pre|&s;erved, they appeared di&s;tinct.</P>
<P>From other ob&s;ervations I find, that if you kill the Spider, and immediately after extract the entrails, then inflate them by means of a blow-pipe, you may pre&s;erve them tolerably well; you mu&s;t clean&s;e them on the in&s;ide no more than is &s;ufficient to prevent mouldine&s;s, le&s;t you injure the colours, which certainly in many kinds depend on &s;ome &s;ub&s;tance that lies beneath the &s;kin.</P>
<P>After inflating them, you may either inject them with fine virgin wax, or anoint the &s;kin with oil of &s;pike in which re&s;in has been di&s;&s;olved, and dry them in &s;ome &s;hady place.</P>
<P>Of the large&s;t kinds of foreign Spiders, the bodies are the only parts which are liable to &s;hrivel; if they were prepared in this man|ner their proper form would be pre&s;erved.</P>

<P>IN this order are included the whole tribe of &s;hells according to the Linnaean arrangement; many di&s;putes having ari&s;en re&s;pecting the proper method of &s;tudying the &s;ubject, Linnaeus made concho|logy a branch of zoology, and not of mineralogy, as preceding authors had cla&s;&s;ed them; there however yet remain very &s;trong arguments again&s;t the method by the animals, although it cannot be denied that the &s;hells are only the coverings or habitations, and &s;hould not therefore demand our primary attention, or be con&s;idered as any farther u&s;eful in e&s;tabli&s;hing the mode of cla&s;&s;ification, than as &s;ubordinate di&s;tinctions.</P>
<P>Fabius Columna was a&s;toni&s;hed that of all the writers on this &s;ubject, not one had con&s;idered the animals that inhabit the &s;hells, but owns, that many are &s;eldom &s;een by us, and that to di&s;cover the manners of their life is extremely difficult.</P>
<P>Mr. Adan&s;on al&s;o, in his Natural Hi&s;tory of Senegal, wi&s;hes to methodize te&s;taceous animals by the Fi&s;h in preference to the &s;hells. He ob&s;erves, that there is &s;uch an infinite variety of the <HI>Libot,</HI> or <HI>Black Limpet,</HI> that it is difficult to meet with two &s;hells alike, and that any per&s;on would be led to conclude that they were di&s;tinct &s;pecies, did not the fi&s;h or animal prove the contrary by admitting of no &s;uch differences. The &s;hells differed in colour and form; &s;ome were white, others grey, a&s;hen, or black; very flat, or very
<PB N="57" REF="62">rai&s;ed; the number of furrows unequal, from twenty-five to fifty; &s;ometimes rigid, or &s;et with &s;mall prickles; the jaggings or tooth|ings of the Contour al&s;o differed widely, &s;ome being &s;mall, or mere|ly notches, while others were fla&s;ht &s;o deep, that they gave the whole &s;hell the form of a &s;tar with five or &s;even rays.</P>
<P>Da Co&s;ta, who&s;e abilities as a concholi&s;t will require no eulogiurn, has however encountered the objections to cla&s;s by the &s;hells, and has convicted Adan&s;on of having confounded the <HI>Libot,</HI> or <HI>Black Limpet,</HI> with the <HI>Thorny Limpet,</HI> the <HI>Beauty,</HI> and the <HI>A&s;trolepas Lim|pets,</HI> all as one &s;pecies, though they have not the lea&s;t re&s;emblance to each other. With re&s;pect to the fi&s;h, he allows with Adan&s;on, that being the &s;ame &s;ort is a pre&s;umptive proof of their being in|dividuals of the &s;ame &s;pecies, but cannot agree that it is a po&s;itive or deci&s;ive one. "I will allow him," &s;ays <HI>Da Co&s;ta,</HI> "that the whole of the external appearance of the fi&s;h, and the particular parts are nearly the &s;ame; yet I think even that is not a po&s;itive proof, for I imagine, the very &s;ame kind of animal inhabits different covers or &s;hells; as for example, the Snails may be the &s;ame kind of fi&s;h, and form the genus, yet vary &s;o much in their habitations or &s;hells, as to form different &s;pecies of that &s;ame genus, from only the differences of the &s;hells or coverings: for the &s;hell or covering may be held for as great a character of the &s;pecies, as the very fi&s;h. Thus the volutes called <HI>Admirals, Brocades, Purple Tips,</HI> or <HI>Onyxes, Tigers,</HI> &amp;c. though &s;uch different &s;hells may be inhabited by the &s;ame kind of fi&s;h, to wit, a <HI>Limax</HI> or <HI>Snail,</HI> and therefore though the <HI>Limax</HI> or <HI>Fi&s;h</HI> is of the very &s;ame kind, and forms or fixes the genus, yet the &s;hells, always con&s;tant, will fix or define the &s;pecies of that &s;ame genus. An analogy to this bears &s;trong through all the animal kingdom; for &s;pecies of quadrupeds are di&s;tingui&s;hed and defined in their genera, from the different colours of their hides;
<PB N="58" REF="63">birds by their various plumage; and in&s;ects by their different colour|ings, therefore why &s;hould not &s;hells, which wear &s;uch &s;trong cha|racters, by the &s;ame parity of rea&s;on, form &s;pecies of the &s;ame genus?

<P>In the la&s;t order it only remains for us to notice the Polypes, who&s;e very a&s;toni&s;hing power of reproducing the parts, which they may be occa&s;ionally deprived of, has given birth to &s;o many learned di&s;cu&s;&s;ions in every part of Europe.</P>
<P>We often ob&s;erve at the bottoms of &s;hallow pools, or on the plants which grow in, or recline on the &s;urface of &s;tagnant water, a number of &s;mall tran&s;parent lumps, about the &s;ize of a pea, and &s;latted on one &s;ide; tho&s;e are Polypes in an inactive &s;tate: they are
<PB N="70" REF="75">generally fixed by one end to &s;ome &s;olid &s;ub&s;tance, at the other end is an opening, which is the mouth of the creature, and the arms &s;hoot forth round it in the form of rays.</P>
<P>They are generally found in waters that move gently; neither rapid &s;treams, nor &s;tagnant waters ever abound with them; they adhere to aquatic plants, to rotten wood, &s;tones, &amp;c. They are &s;eldom met with in winter, but in the month of May they begin to appear, and are to be found in ditches all the &s;ummer.</P>
<P>When you &s;earch for Polypes it will be be&s;t to take up a quantity of the pieces of wood, &amp;c. that are u&s;ually found in ditches, and put them into a gla&s;s of water, let it &s;tand for a while without moving it, and if there are any Polypes adhering to the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances, you will perceive them &s;tretching out their arms in &s;earch for their prey.</P>
<P>Mr. Trembley di&s;covered that a &s;mall &s;pecies of Millepede was an excellent food for tho&s;e little animals; they will al&s;o devour the Pulices Aquatices, the &s;mall red worms which are found in the mud banks on the banks of the Thames, common worms, the larva of gnats, and other in&s;ects, and even butcher's meat if cut &s;mall enough.</P>
<P>If a &s;ufficient quantity of the red worms which are found on the mud banks, be gathered in the month of November, and put into a large gla&s;s, with three or four inches of earth at the bottom, the Polypes may be fed in the winter; clean&s;e the worms before they are put in among the Polypes.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="76">To pre&s;erve tho&s;e creatures in health, it will be proper to change the water in which they are kept very frequently, and particularly after they have done eating; the water mu&s;t be poured off, the Poly|pes taken out, and the &s;ides and bottom of the gla&s;s wa&s;hed free from all &s;limy &s;ediment. To take them out, fir&s;t loo&s;en their tails from the &s;ides or bottom of the gla&s;s; then take them out &s;eparately, with a quill cut in the &s;hape of a &s;coop, and put them into a gla&s;s with clean water.</P>
<P>The power of reproduction is &s;o great in tho&s;e creatures that if a Polype is cut tran&s;ver&s;ely, or longitudinally, in two or three parts, it is not de&s;troyed; in a little time each part will become a per|fect Polype; even a &s;mall portion of the &s;kin will produce a new creature.</P>
<P>If a Polype is &s;lit, beginning at the head, and proceeding to the middle of the body, a Polype will be formed with two heads, and will eat at the &s;ame time with both. If a Polype is &s;lit into &s;ix or &s;even parts, it becomes a hydra, with &s;ix or &s;even heads. If they are again divided it will have twelve or fourteen. If tho&s;e again be &s;evered from the trunk, as many new ones will &s;pring up in their place, and the heads thus deprived of the body will become new Polypes al&s;o.</P>

Tho&s;e &s;eeds which I have &s;een brought over in this manner, had &s;hot out roots owing to the heat of the climates they had pa&s;&s;ed through, and the confined moi&s;ture; and though not twenty out of two hundred in the cani&s;ter &s;ucceeded, yet the&s;e are thought a great acqui&s;ition.</P>

<P>Colonel Davies has given the following u&s;eful in&s;tructions for the tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion of plants from one country to another.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="82">"With re&s;pect to &s;hrubs and plants, I would recommend (as I have from con&s;iderable experience found) their being dug up care|fully, &s;o as to break the roots as little as po&s;&s;ible; when about eighteen inches, or two feet high, wa&s;h all &s;tones and earthy parti|cles away from the roots as clean as po&s;&s;ible with fre&s;h water, pro|cure boxes of any kind of wood inch thick, thirty or thirty-&s;ix inches long, fourteen or &s;ixteen wide, and as many deep; bore a con&s;ider|able number of holes with a large gimblet in the bottom and lid. Cover the bottom with &s;oft long wet mo&s;t, about an inch or two thick, and lay the plants with their tops towards the ends of the box as clo&s;e as po&s;&s;ible, about two inches deep: cover them with a layer of wet mo&s;s, inch deep, and proceed with another layer of plants, and &s;o on until the whole of the box is filled, covering the upper layer of all with wet mo&s;s in like manner. If &s;ome mo&s;s is al&s;o added to the ends of the box the better, as their being pre&s;&s;ed clo&s;e down in the box does not damage or injure them; many by &s;o doing may be packed in a &s;mall &s;pace. Nail on the top of the box and immer&s;e it under water in a pond, river, or tub, for a few minutes to admit it into the mo&s;s; it may then be kept in any damp cellar or out-hou&s;e free from harm, until &s;ent on board &s;hip, and requires no further trouble, but once in five or &s;ix weeks to pour &s;ome fre&s;h water on the top or bottom, through the holes, to moi&s;ten the mo&s;s within. In this manner va&s;t quantities of &s;carce and va|luable plants may be ea&s;ily tran&s;ported from one part of the globe to another. Although I have never yet made the experiment my&s;elf, I am confident that all kinds of nuts, and hard &s;eeds, may be &s;ent in this manner from place to place with great probability of &s;ecurity and &s;ucce&s;s; as the vegetative part of the &s;eed, by being nouri&s;hed by the moi&s;ture of the mo&s;s, will be &s;urer pre&s;erved, than by any other mode I have heard of.

<P>We cannot di&s;mi&s;s tho&s;e in&s;tructions for the pre&s;ervation or tran&s;|portation of &s;eeds, without taking notice of a very intere&s;ting di&s;co|very which Mr. John Lind&s;ay, a &s;urgeon in Jamaica, communicated to Sir Jo&s;eph Banks, Bart. in the year 1789, relative to the germi|nation
<PB N="79" REF="84">and rai&s;ing of Ferns from the &s;eed. We &s;hall not pre&s;ume to follow this gentleman through the whole of his very plea&s;ing di&s;cour&s;e, but refer our readers, if they de&s;ire a farther account, to the thirteenth article of the Linnaean Tran&s;actions, Vol. II.</P>
<P>Mr. Lind&s;ay, as being an a&s;&s;i&s;tant to Dr. Clarke, botani&s;t for that i&s;land, could not be ignorant of the various opinions which were entertained by botani&s;ts re&s;pecting the fructification of this tribe of plants, and of the difficulty of rai&s;ing them from the &s;eeds; having &s;ome &s;pare time when he arrived at Jamaica which he could with propriety dedicate to a minute ob&s;ervance of tho&s;e plants, he en|deavoured to a&s;certain their &s;eed; their minutene&s;s rendered every at|tempt to di&s;cover them, by &s;earching at the roots of even the &s;malle&s;t vi&s;ible plants fruitle&s;s, he then thought of &s;owing the powder or du&s;t which falls from the leaves when drying in a flower-pot, and ob|&s;erving their progre&s;s; to do this with care and certainty he mixed &s;ome of the powder with &s;ome of the mould it was to be &s;own in, and by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the micro&s;cope was &s;oon able to di&s;tin|gui&s;h the different parts of the powder, or fructification from the mould in which it was &s;own. He next proceeds to relate the altera|tions which he ob&s;erved in the &s;eeds of &s;everal &s;pecies, from the fir&s;t &s;ymptoms of vegetation to the expan&s;ion of the leaves, and illu&s;trates the progre&s;s by &s;everal figures and &s;uitable references. Engaging in the practice of medicine &s;oon after, he thought no more of the &s;ubject, till he had the honour of a very polite letter from Sir Jo&s;eph Banks, Bart. by which he was induced to re|&s;ume his ob&s;ervations, and tran&s;mit his valuable di&s;covery to England.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="85">He &s;ays "the &s;eeds of Ferns may be procured with readine&s;s and ea&s;e by taking tho&s;e frondes or leaves on which the fructification is copious, fair and con&s;picuous; which are of full growth, have a healthy appearance, and are more expo&s;ed to the free air than con|fined in the &s;hade. The&s;e leaves, laid on clean paper in a dry place, &s;oon &s;hed their &s;eed in the form of du&s;t or fine powder, of colour varying from black or brown to yellow; the gro&s;&s;er part of this powder is the empty cap&s;ules, and that very fine part which adheres clo&s;e to the paper is the &s;eed. The &s;eeds thus procured may be &s;own immediately, or kept in paper in a dry place."</P>
<P>He next determines, that like other vegetables, many &s;pecies of Ferns requires a &s;oil and &s;ituation peculiar to them&s;elves; he took equal parts of brick mould and good pit marle, at &s;ome depth below the &s;urface, to avoid the &s;eeds of other plants, mixed them well together, and with this filled the flower-pot, moi&s;tened it pro|perly, and made the &s;urface very &s;mooth; he then divided it into &s;mall &s;paces, according to the number of the different kinds in|tended to be &s;own in it; and la&s;tly &s;trewed the &s;eeds lightly on the &s;urface. The &s;eeds which are &s;own in this manner &s;hould be placed in a heat corre&s;ponding to that of their native climate, in a place rather moi&s;t than too dry, freely open to the light and fre&s;h air, but &s;o &s;haded that the direct rays of the &s;un cannot reach them.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS <HI>On the Manner of making a</HI> HORTUS-SICCUS.</HEAD>
<P>The Abb&eacute; Hauy, of the royal academy of &s;ciences at Paris, in the year 1785, pre&s;ented that &s;ociety with the following intere&s;ting ob&s;ervations, relative to the pre&s;ervation of dried plants.</P>
<P>"Of all the productions of nature, there are none more &s;u&s;ceptible of change than vegetables, or which require more care and attention for their pre&s;ervation. Flowers, in particular, &s;oon lo&s;e their colours in an herbal, and a&s;&s;ume others, quite different from tho&s;e be&s;towed on them by nature. Yellow grows pale, or becomes nearly effaced; blue or red are &s;till more apt to fade or di&s;appear entirely. The flowers of the Violet, the Campanula, of &s;everal &s;pecies of Gera|nium, and a multitude of other plants which add to the ornament of the fields, and often to that even of our gardens, become, in a few days &s;o much tarni&s;hed, that they cannot be known by any eye but that of an experienced botani&s;t.</P>
<P>"This inconvenience I have endeavoured to remedy, at lea&s;t, in part; and as I found it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to fix the natural colours of plants, I attempted to di&s;cover a method of &s;ub&s;tituting artificial colours for them which might not fade, &s;o that the flower, by pre|&s;erving its bloom, and all its e&s;&s;ential characteri&s;tics, might in &s;ome degree exhibit its natural colour. For this purpo&s;e, I painted a piece of fine paper with water colours in &s;uch a manner as to have, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the &s;ame degree of &s;trength as tho&s;e of nature,
<PB N="82" REF="87">only a little fainter, for a rea&s;on I &s;hall mention hereafter. When I had done this I threw the leaves into &s;pirits of wine, where they &s;oon lo&s;t all their colours, and were reduced to whiti&s;h tran&s;parent membranes. After having dried them thoroughly, by pre&s;&s;ing them between two folds of a fine cloth, I laid them on the coloured paper by means of a thick varni&s;h, which I took care to &s;pread over the paper in order that they might adhere to it, I afterwards drew another paper, &s;everal times over the flower pre&s;&s;ing it &s;trongly with my hand until all the leaves were properly applied, and until the artificial colours appeared through them. In this operation the colours become a little darker; for which rea&s;on it will be nece&s;&s;ary to make the tints a little fainter than what they are naturally. I afterwards left the flower a few moments in a pre&s;s, then, having cut the paper around it, I applied it with a di&s;&s;olution of gum|arabic to the place it &s;hould occupy on the plant, which had been before fixed by means of the &s;ame di&s;&s;olution to a piece of paper of a proper &s;ize.</P>
<P>"It will be of great &s;ervice when tho&s;e flowers even are applied, which have permanent colours, &s;uch as the greater part of the wild Ranunculu&s;es, to begin by cementing the flowers to a piece of paper, and to cut it round the leaves, as in the preceding ca&s;e, before they are added to the plant. This operation renders them more natural, and if their po&s;ition is &s;uch that they cover the leaves of the plant, which will often happen, the colour of the leaves does not injure that of the flowers, by appearing through their delicate membraness, which are in part diaphonous.</P>
<P>"There are &s;ome plants, the leaves of which, on account of their thickne&s;s and &s;pongy &s;ub&s;tance, cannot ea&s;ily be dried, and which become black before their juices have been extracted by the
<PB N="83" REF="88">ordinary mode of drying. Such, among others, are tho&s;e of the orchis. I have ob&s;erved that by peeling off, with a pointed knife, the thin pellicle which covers the lower part of the&s;e leaves, before I cemented them to the paper, it greatly ha&s;tened their de&s;iccation, &s;o that it generally took place in two or three days, and even in a much &s;horter &s;pace of time. The leaves then pre&s;erved their ver|dure in a great mea&s;ure, or, at lea&s;t, a&s;&s;umed only a tint inclining a very little to yellow, without ever appearing of that black colour which indicates the la&s;t degree of decay in a &s;pecies of productions the mo&s;t beautiful and plea&s;ing in nature.</P>
<P>"I have &s;ubmitted to the in&s;pection of the academy the Violet, the Geranium, and the common Poppy of the fields, the artificial colours of which have pre&s;erved their lu&s;tre for many years, I have added al&s;o three &s;pecies of orchis, the leaves of which &s;till retain their fre&s;hne&s;s after being dried ten years, the &s;ummer Adonis and common Cinque Foil, &amp;c. the natural colours of which have been pre&s;erved without any other precaution than the care I took to dry them between folds of warm paper as &s;peedily as I po&s;&s;ibly could, and not to expo&s;e them to the air, or to moi&s;ture."</P>
<P>This method may be applied to mo&s;t plants, with the greate&s;t pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s; but as the time it will require to pre&s;erve only a few &s;pecimens may be more than every collector can &s;pare, a more &s;imple proce&s;s is recommended; dry the plants between the leaves of a large book, or &s;heets of &s;tout paper, and pre&s;s them even in a &s;crew-pre&s;s, or let them remain under a heavy weight for &s;ome time; then &s;pread a thin coat of gum-arabic on the paper, and di&s;play the plants thereon as &s;mooth as po&s;&s;ible. They &s;hould after this be covered with a thin coat of copal varni&s;h to pre&s;erve them from the ravages of infects, or the ill effects of damp.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="89">Plants lo&s;e all their native verdure in &s;pirit of wine, but pre|&s;erve their form perfectly well, if therefore they are pre&s;erved on account of the &s;ingular &s;tructure of any part, it is be&s;t to keep them in bottles, with either &s;pirit of wine, rum, or brandy, &amp;c. Spirit of wine diluted with common water will pre&s;erve the colours of &s;ome plants tolerably well.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t intere&s;ting di&s;cour&s;e we have met with on the pre|&s;ervation of vegetables, is that which Dr. Withering communicated to the Linnaean Society in December, 1794; it is inferted as the 23d article of the &s;econd volume of the Tran&s;actions of that Society. Dr. Withering has confined his di&s;cour&s;e to the pre&s;ervation of Fungi, only ob&s;erving that Mo&s;&s;es and Lichens might be pre&s;erved in great perfection by the &s;ame methods.</P>
<P>He ob&s;erves that acids, even tho&s;e of a mineral origin, are apt to produce mouldine&s;s; that neutral &s;alts often de&s;troy the texture of the plants; though perhaps a weak &s;olution of common &s;alt, with a &s;ufficient quantity of &s;pirit of wine, might be u&s;ed advantageou&s;ly for the pre&s;ervation of Fuci, and other marine vegetables. Earthy &s;alts &s;eem u&s;ele&s;s, except alum, which pre&s;erves them tolerably well for a time, but at length they are apt to become mouldy.</P>
<P>For the preparation of the liquors No. 1 and No. 2, which he found mo&s;t efficacious, he has given the following directions. No. 1. "To half a pound of vitriol of copper, called blue vitriol, reduced to powder, add a pint of cold water: &s;tir them together for a minute, and then throw away the water: upon the remain|ing vitriol pour half a pint of boiling water: and &s;tir them fre|quently until the liquor be nearly cool. Set it by in a warm place, for two or three days, to cry&s;tallize.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="90">"Take any quantity of the&s;e cry&s;tals, add to them as much hot water as will barely di&s;&s;olve them, and put the &s;olution into a vial.</P>
<P>"To two or three quarts of pure &s;pring water, put as much of this &s;olution of blue vitriol as will give the whole a very &s;light blui&s;h tinge: then add to it, rectified &s;pirit of wine, in the pro|portion of a pint to a gallon: filter the liquor through blotting or cap paper, and put it into bottles for u&s;e."</P>
<P>"No. 2. Di&s;&s;olve a quarter of an ounce of &s;ugar of lead in a pint of di&s;tilled or very pure &s;pring water, made boiling hot; add &s;even pints of pure cold water, and one pint of rectified &s;pirit of wine: filter the liquor, and keep it in bottles."</P>
<P>"The above proportion of &s;pirit of wine is &s;ufficient for the thicke&s;t and mo&s;t &s;ucculent &s;pecimens, but le&s;s will do for &s;uch as are thick and not juicy. If the &s;pirit be &s;ufficient to prevent mouldine&s;s, it is enough, for more has a tendency to extract the colours."</P>
<P>"Put the &s;pecimens into wide-mouthed jars made of flint gla&s;s, and well fitted with corks: fill the jars quite full with one or other of the above liquids, &s;o as to leave in as little air as po&s;&s;ible: cork the jars very clo&s;e, covering the corks with tin foil, or &s;heet lead, &s;uch as may be had from the dealers in tea, turning the edge of the lead or tin downwards &s;o as to lap over and under the edge of the jar.</P>
<P>"The dark-coloured plants are very apt to di&s;colour the liqour, the milky ones to render it turbid, and &s;ome of the juicy ones to
<PB N="86" REF="91">excite the vinous fermentation. In any of the&s;e ca&s;es the liquor mu&s;t be repeatedly changed.</P>
<P>"I have principally u&s;ed the liquor No. 1; but No. 2 is be&s;t adapted to pre&s;erve &s;ome of the more tender colours, and it al&s;o keeps the texture more firm. Let the botani&s;t however be careful not to mix the liquors, not to change one for the other after a plant has been wetted with one of them."</P>
<P>Dr. Withering in the cour&s;e of this di&s;&s;ertation has al&s;o given &s;ome in&s;tructions for the tran&s;portation of Agarics; his method is nearly the &s;ame as that pre&s;cribed by Colonel Davies for the tran&s;|portation of &s;hrubs and plants in general, except that he advi&s;es to put the plants and mo&s;s in layers into an earthen jar, in&s;tead of an open box; and to pour in the liquid No. 1, as long as the layers of mo&s;s, between the plants, will continue to imbibe any; then to &s;top up the mouth &s;ecurely.</P>
