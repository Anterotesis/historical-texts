<L>_IN the full pro&s;pect yonder hill commands,</L>
<L>O'er fore&s;ts, fields, and vernal-coated plains;</L>
<L>The ve&s;tige of an ancient abbey &s;tands,</L>
<L>Clo&s;e by a ruin'd ca&s;tle's rude remains.</L>

<L>Half buried, there, lie many a broken bu&s;t,</L>
<L>And obeli&s;k, and urn, o'erthrown by TIME;</L>
<L>And many a cherub, here, de&s;cends in du&s;t</L>
<L>From the rent roof, and portico &s;ublime.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="3">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<L>The rivulets, oft frighted at the &s;ound</L>
<L>Of fragments, tumbling from the tow'rs on high;</L>
<L>Plunge to their &s;ource in &s;ecret caves profound,</L>
<L>Leaving their banks and pebbly bottoms dry.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="4">
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<L>Where rev'rend &s;hrines in Gothic grandeur &s;tood,</L>
<L>The nettle, or the noxious night-&s;hade, &s;preads;</L>
<L>And a&s;hlings, wafted from the neighb'ring wood,</L>
<L>Through the worn turrets wave their trembling heads.</L>

<L>Soon as &s;age ev'ning check'd day's &s;unny pride,</L>
<L>I left the mantling &s;hade, in moral mood;</L>
<L>And &s;eated by the maid's &s;eque&s;ter'd &s;ide,</L>
