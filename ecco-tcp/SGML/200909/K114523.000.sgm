<HEAD>To the PUBLICK.</HEAD>
<P>A Paultry Collection of Songs having lately made its Appearance, to which the Pub|li&s;her has, with uncommon Effrontery, prefixed my Name as the Editor, and upon my di&s;claiming the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">&s;it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on, has even had the A&s;&s;urance, in a publick Adverti&s;ement, to a&s;&s;ert that he had my Authority for &s;o doing;&mdash;although I have more Veneration for the Publick, than either to trouble them, or load the Daily Papers with an Altercation between a little Country Shopkeeper and a Ballad-Maker, yet I once for all beg Leave to &s;tate the real Fact.</P>
<P>About four Years ago I exhibited my LECTURE at <HI>Whitehaven,</HI> and having Occa&s;ion to u&s;e this Man's Shop, he took the Opportunity of &s;olliciting me to give him a few Comic Songs, <Q>becau&s;e he had a Mind to publi&s;h a Volume to plea&s;e his Cu&s;tomers in the Part of the Country where he lived,</Q> and at the &s;ame Time opening a Song Book, &s;hewed me &s;everal under my Name, which he told me he pur|po&s;ed to print in his Collection:&mdash;My Reply was;&mdash; <Q><HI>Sir, There is not one of tho&s;e printed as I wrote them; and &s;ome to which my Name is affixed are really not mine.</HI></Q>&mdash;<Q>But &s;ir, replied my Chapman, will you plea&s;e to give your&s;elf the Trouble to mark &s;uch
<PB N="ii" REF="4">of them as are yours.</Q>&mdash;<Q><HI>Why really, &s;ir, I am a&s;hamed of them.</HI></Q>&mdash;<Q>Lord, &s;ir, they'll do very well here; pray, &s;ir, take the Book home, and be &s;o obliging as to mark them for me. &mdash; And, if it would not give Mr <HI>Stevens</HI> too much Trouble, I &s;hould be greatly obliged if he would ju&s;t put a Mark upon any other Songs in the Book that he thinks worth printing.</Q>&mdash;This was done, and the Volume returned the next Day.</P>
<P>From hence I could not imagine he would do <HI>more</HI> than in&s;ert my Name to the Songs I had owned; and I &s;olemnly declare he had no Authority from me to u&s;e it otherwi&s;e. &mdash; What I did was a meer Act of common Civility;&mdash;I had not then, nor have I &s;ince had any Connections with the Man; and upon this Ground alone he has had the <HI>Mode&s;ty</HI> to charge me with a Breach of Promi&s;e by my Di&s;avowal.&mdash; This, among other Rea&s;ons, has induced me to publi&s;h my own Songs, which I now claim as Property, and have entered in the Hall Books of the Stationers Company.</P>

<P>THE Writer of the&s;e Ballads, by way of Preface, begs leave to introduce a <HI>Fragment,</HI> which he happily met with among the MSS pre&s;erved in that ine&s;timable receptacle of Curio&s;ities at <HI>Chel&s;ea,</HI> well known to the <HI>Literati</HI> of all Nations, under the denomination of DON SALTERO'S COFFEE-HOUSE.</P>
<P>This Fragment indeed bears no marks of Antiquity; yet the origin as well as progre&s;s of MUSIC and POETRY is here traced with uncommon per&s;pi|cuity; and it is greatly to be lamented that the Author him&s;elf could not be con&s;ulted, for putting the fini&s;hing hand to &s;o arduous and elaborate an under|taking.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF CHOICE SPIRITS AND BALLAD SINGING.</HEAD>
<P>JUBAL, or TUBAL CAIN, was the fir&s;t compo&s;er of Tunes; his Lyre preceded <HI>Orion's, Amphion's,</HI> and even the <HI>Harp</HI> of <HI>Orpheus.</HI></P>
<P>ORION, when making his voyage upon the Dolphin's back, invented <HI>Wa|ter Mu&s;ic.</HI></P>
<P>AMPHION introduced <HI>Cotillons</HI> as well as <HI>Country Dancing.</HI></P>
<P>ORPHEUS, to plea&s;e his <HI>Eurydice,</HI> ex|hibited the fir&s;t <HI>Harmonic Meeting.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="7">And on the mountain <HI>Gibello,</HI> CIRCE held her fir&s;t Court for COMUS. The Magazines of the Ancients, tho&s;e mo&s;t u&s;eful repo&s;itories of ready-made erudi|tion tell us, that BACCHUS in&s;tituted a Club at this very period, called the <HI>Baccae</HI> or <HI>Bacchantes,</HI> and which are now called the BUCKS; as it appears, not only by <HI>Nimrod's</HI> ancient Charter depo&s;ited in the Archives of the <HI>Babylonian</HI> Lodge in the environs of <HI>Soho,</HI> but al&s;o by the authenticated Records belonging to the <HI>Pewter Platter</HI> in <HI>Bi&s;hop&s;gate-precinct.</HI></P>
<P>And to the&s;e two Bodies of that Noble and Ancient Order, the following En|graving of the famous GOBLET, or CUP u&s;ed by the GRAND BUCK at <HI>Rome,</HI> when he celebrated the <HI>Secular Games,</HI> is here addre&s;&s;ed, with its original In&s;crip|tion, and a Tran&s;lation, for the mutual entertainment of tho&s;e di&s;tinct Cla&s;&s;es of <HI>Critics,</HI> the LEARNED and UN|LEARNED, who alternately take the lead in all Conver&s;ations.</P>

<P>After <HI>Circe's</HI> elopement with <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> they became wanderers upon the Face of the Earth, and like <HI>Jews,</HI> and <HI>Strol|ing-players,</HI> continue <HI>Itinerants</HI> even unto this day; they have neverthele&s;s mul|tiplied exceedingly, propagating their Convivialities into the different <HI>Orders</HI> of GRIGS, GREGS, and GREGORIANS; &mdash;ANTIGALLICANS, FREE MASONS, and MACARONI;&mdash;SONS of SOUND SENSE and SATISFACTION;&mdash;SONS of KIT, and OLD SOULS;&mdash;TRUE BLUES, PUR|PLES, and ALBIONS; &mdash; The BEEF STEAK, JOCKEY, and CATCH CLUBS; &mdash;The MAGDALENS, and LUMBER TROOP, with many Others; all which acknowledge the Affinity they bear to their paternal Society, by celebrating
<PB N="8" REF="10">their Evening My&s;teries with a <HI>Song</HI> and a <HI>Sentiment.</HI></P>
<P>The CHOICE SPIRITS have ever been famous for their Talents as Mu&s;ical Arti&s;ts. They u&s;ually met at the har|ve&s;t-homes of Grape-gathering: There exhilerated by the pre&s;&s;ings of the Vin|tage, they were wont to &s;ing Songs, tell Stories, and &s;hew Tricks, from their fir&s;t emerging, until their Perihelion under the Pre&s;ident&s;hip of Mr. GEORGE ALEXANDER STEVENS, <HI>Ballad-Laureat</HI> to the Society of CHOICE SPIRITS, and who appeared at Ranelagh in the Cha|racter of COMUS, &s;upported by tho&s;e Droles of merry Memory.</P>
<P>Unparalleled were their performances, as <HI>fir&s;t Fi&s;ts</HI> upon the SALT-BOX, and inimitable the variations they would twang upon the <HI>forte</HI> and <HI>piano</HI> JEWS-HARP. Excellent was <HI>Howard</HI> in the CHIN CONCERTO; who&s;e No&s;e al&s;o &s;upplied the melodious Tones of the BAGPIPE. &mdash; Upon the STICCADO <HI>Matt.

<P>Alas! the&s;e Stars are all extingui&s;hed; and the remains of ancient Briti&s;h Har|mony is now confined to the manly Mu&s;ic of MARROW-BONES and CLEAVERS.</P>
