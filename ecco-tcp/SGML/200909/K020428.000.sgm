<HEAD>FRANKPLEDGE.</HEAD>
<P>THE mo&s;t certain and effectual mode of &s;ecuring peace, right, and mutual protection, for any community, is the old Engli&s;h &s;y&s;tem of mutual <HI>Frankpledge,</HI> or <HI>free &s;urety&s;hip,</HI> given by all <HI>the hou&s;e|holders,</HI> for them&s;elves and each other, in exact numerical divi&s;ions of <HI>tens</HI> and hundreds; which, in the Engli&s;h law|books, is called <HI>"Maxima &s;ecuritas"</HI>&mdash;<HI>"the greate&s;t &s;ecurity,"</HI> though it is now unhappily neglected, and con&s;equently crimes abound and increa&s;e; &s;o that,
<PB N="2" REF="3">notwith&s;tanding the horrible increa&s;e al&s;o of <HI>bloody laws</HI> to intimidate offenders, yet there is <HI>no effectual &s;ecurity</HI> from vio|lence and robbery, either in our &s;treets or roads, or even in our chambers; &s;ince the hou&s;es of the rich and great, nay of the fir&s;t officers of the &s;tate, are not ex|empted from the nocturnal intru&s;ion of hou&s;ebreakers, in&s;omuch that even the Lord Chancellor and Honourable Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Commons have lately experienced the common danger, and the deplorable want of the antient <HI>"Maxima &s;ecuritas."</HI> That funda|mental &s;y&s;tem of <HI>Engli&s;h polity</HI> is &s;o little known among us at pre&s;ent, that many well-meaning per&s;ons are induced, by their fears, to wi&s;h for <HI>&s;ecurity,</HI> on a much le&s;s eligible plan, formed on the model of the arbitrary &s;y&s;tem of govern|ment in France, commonly called <HI>police,</HI> the introduction of which would be an utter perver&s;ion of the fir&s;t principles of
<PB N="3" REF="4"><HI>legal</HI> government in England. The inha|bitants even of the mo&s;t di&s;tant &s;ettle|ments under the crown of Great-Britain mu&s;t not adopt any <HI>polity</HI> that is e&s;&s;en|tially <HI>incon&s;i&s;tent</HI> with the <HI>Maxima &s;ecu|ritas,</HI> ordained and required by the common law of England.</P>
<P>The community of free African &s;et|tlers, however, have already adopted (as I am informed) a &s;mall variation from the old Engli&s;h model of numerical di|vi&s;ions, by forming them&s;elves into di|vi&s;ions of <HI>dozens,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>tithings</HI> or <HI>tens;</HI> but as this little change is by no means <HI>incon&s;i&s;tent</HI> with the true princi|ples and intention of our legal Engli&s;h <HI>frankpledge,</HI> I am at liberty to acknow|ledge a mo&s;t hearty approbation of it, as being an arrangement far more con|venient and effectual for &s;ecuring perfect &s;ubordination, peace, and good govern|ment, even than the antient legal divi|&s;ions

<P>N. B.

<P><HI>HUMAN Labour</HI> is more e&s;&s;ential and valuable than any other article in new &s;ettlements, which chiefly depend on the cultivation and produce of the earth for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and commer|cial profit. On this account, though the price of provi&s;ions is generally lower in new &s;ettlements than in communi|ties of long &s;tanding, yet the price of <HI>Free Labour</HI> is always much higher; and higher &s;till, or rather infinitely <HI>more
<PB N="14" REF="15">expen&s;ive</HI> (however &s;laveholders may reckon) is <HI>the labour of &s;laves,</HI> be&s;ides the abominable inju&s;tice, the corruption of manners, the danger, and other <HI>cur&s;es,</HI> which <HI>always attend</HI> the tolera|tion of &s;lavery! <HI>Free labour,</HI> therefore, in all new &s;ettlements, ought to be made the <HI>&s;tandard,</HI> or <HI>medium,</HI> whereby to rate the value of all the nece&s;&s;aries of life, as well as of all articles of com|merce in the &s;ettlement: a cow, &s;heep, or hog, or a bu&s;hel of corn, &s;hould each be valued at a proportionable number of <HI>day's labour,</HI> e&s;timated at eight hours actual labour per day; and a pig, rabbit, or fowl, at &s;o many <HI>hours labour,</HI> ac|cording to their re&s;pective &s;izes; and for the fractional e&s;timation of &s;maller arti|cles, the hours may be reduced to <HI>minutes,</HI> and thereby afford an excellent &s;ub&s;titute for money as a medium of traffic and exchange, whereon a <HI>paper currency</HI> may be e&s;tabli&s;hed, which will
<PB N="15" REF="16">always bear an <HI>intrin&s;ic value,</HI> without diminution, as hereafter explained under the head of <HI>Publick Revenue.</HI></P>
<P>The daily commencement of publick labour and of hired labour, and all the nece&s;&s;ary ce&s;&s;ations from labour for re&s;t and refre&s;hment, &s;hould be limited to &s;tated periods of time, rendered uniform and general, throughout the &s;ettlement, by the periodical &s;ummons of a publick bell, as in our <HI>dock yards</HI> and great ma|nufactories, for the more effectual pre|vention of impo&s;ition by the employer or employed.</P>
<P>By the limitation of labour to eight hours per day, the rateable or legal days work (in&s;tead of continuing from &s;ix in the morning to &s;ix in the evening, as with us) will end at four in the after|noon, including two whole hours for nece&s;&s;ary refre&s;hment and re&s;t; unle&s;s it
<PB N="16" REF="17">&s;hould be thought more convenient in general to begin at five in the morning, and to work three hours till eight, and then, after re&s;ting half an hour at break|fa&s;t, to work three hours and an half more till noon, when a moderate and temperate meal, &s;uitable to the heat of the climate, may be rendered more re|fre&s;hing and healthful to the labourer by a <HI>general &s;e&s;too,</HI> or &s;leeping time, during the meridean heat till half pa&s;t one; which re&s;t of one hour and an half, at one time, will be amply &s;ufficient to recruit them for the remaining burthen of the rateable labour, or legal day's work, viz. one hour and an half more, ending at three o'clock in the afternoon, when the <HI>evening</HI> of the antients com|menced, and the appointed hour of <HI>even|ing &s;acrifice</HI> in the patriarchal times. If, therefore, the new &s;ociety would agree to a&s;&s;emble at <HI>that hour,</HI> in whatever place they &s;hall afterwards appropriate
<PB N="17" REF="18">to religious wor&s;hip, and there join toge|ther in a very &s;hort <HI>general form of prayer and evening &s;acrifice of thanks</HI> (in which, to remove all objections about the value of time, they need not be detained much longer than about five minutes, to ex|pre&s;s all that may be ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary for every good purpo&s;e of prayer and thank&s;giving, at lea&s;t as a <HI>daily</HI> &s;er|vice) they will &s;oon be convinced that no human mea&s;ure is &s;o well calculated to add real dignity to the ordinary la|bourer, as well with re&s;pect to his own <HI>internal</HI> improvement, as in the out|ward e&s;teem and con&s;ideration which it will nece&s;&s;arily in&s;ure to him from others, by continually reminding the rich and higher ranks of men that the daily la|bourer is their brother and their <HI>equal</HI> in the &s;ight of God, and that all men ought to be <HI>equally</HI> &s;ervants to <HI>the &s;ame Lord!</HI> I could wi&s;h that a &s;hort daily morning prayer might al&s;o be adopted at
<PB N="18" REF="19">nine o'clock, after breakfa&s;t, but I pro|po&s;e with diffidence, le&s;t publick prayers even <HI>only once</HI> a day &s;hould be obtained with difficulty.</P>
<P>As &s;ome of the <HI>out lots</HI> will be di&s;tant about two miles from the centre of the town&s;hip, it may perhaps be more expe|dient to commence the rateable daily labour even half an hour &s;ooner &s;till, than I have la&s;t propo&s;ed, viz. at half pa&s;t four in the cool of the morning, where|by all <HI>publick labour</HI> will end at half pa&s;t two in the afternoon, which will allow time for labourers in the di&s;tant lots to repair to the general a&s;&s;embly of the town&s;hip, at <HI>evening prayer.</HI> And an officer from every dozen may be ordered to be prepared, by a previous examina|tion, at the publick bank of all the in|dents in cour&s;e for each day's labour; that after being di&s;charged in the pub|lick books, they may be cancelled, and
<PB N="19" REF="20">mo&s;t expeditiou&s;ly returned to tho&s;e who have fulfilled them; all which, by the happy &s;y&s;tem of <HI>Frankpledge,</HI> may be mo&s;t ea&s;ily effected with very little lo&s;s of time; &s;o that the labourers may return from the centre of the town&s;hip to their own private lots, and have near five hours of lei&s;ure to them&s;elves to cul|tivate their own land, even if they work no later than eight at night, which will allow them ample time for re&s;t, e&s;pe|cially as the mid-day <HI>&s;e&s;too</HI> will render le&s;s &s;leep nece&s;&s;ary at night.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="21">A &s;eventh part of the year &s;hall be appropriated more particularly to God's &s;ervice, and &s;hall be duly ob&s;erved and kept holy, on the pe|nalty of &s;even weeks, or forty-two days labour in the publick lots for every breach of this univer&s;al law of God, either in buying, &s;elling, or <HI>working for pecuniary profit;</HI> or for <HI>travelling,</HI> unle&s;s a very urgent nece&s;&s;ity can be proved: and this penalty to be doubled on a repeti|tion or continuance of the offence. 52 Sundays or days of our Lord.</P>
<P>Two more days &s;hall be appro|priated to a religious commemora|tion of our Lord's birth and expia|tory death, at the u&s;ual &s;ea&s;ons; and a third day to the great annual <HI>view of Frankpledge,</HI> to be ap|pointed at &s;ome convenient &s;ea&s;on, after the greate&s;t and mo&s;t general harve&s;t of the year, the remem|brance of which &s;hall al&s;o be &s;o|lemnized on that day by religious thank&s;giving both at the opening and conclu&s;ion of the <HI>view of Frankpledge;</HI>&mdash;&s;o that the 365 days of the year will be further reduced by the deduction al&s;o of 3 Holidays.</P>
<P>The abovementioned Sundays and holidays, amounting to fifty|five days, being deducted from the year, there will remain only 310 Days of labour.</P>

The publick Exchequer will be enabled, by the con&s;ent of a majority of the &s;et|tlers, thus to di&s;po&s;e of land, becau&s;e all the <HI>unoccupied</HI> land in the &s;ettlement

And if the <HI>voluntary labour of a man</HI> &s;hould really be worth three times what I have e&s;timated (as I really believe it is) the profit for redemption, for 11l. di&s;|bur&s;ed, will amount to 105l. 5s. which is 956 9/11l. per cent. in favour of the

<P>Ma&s;ters of <HI>apprentices,</HI> and al&s;o of <HI>in|dentured &s;trangers,</HI> brought by them into the &s;ettlement, &s;hall be obliged to regi&s;ter the &s;aid indentured per&s;ons in the

<P>When a man has worked out, or otherwi&s;e redeemed any of the paper|money, for which he is nominally re|&s;pon&s;ible, and &s;hall have received back the indenture, after the &s;ervice, he may produce it at the Exchequer, together with its corre&s;ponding checque, that it may be cancelled in the publick ac|compt; whereby the di&s;charge of pub|lick debts may be as regularly proved and authenticated as the ju&s;t demands abovementioned; and the &s;tate of a man's publick debt may always be known at
<PB N="64" REF="65">the publick Exchequer by the balance of indentures in his accompt; and thereby all frauds and impo&s;itions may be ea&s;ily traced and detected.</P>
<P>As <HI>Labour</HI> in all new &s;ettlements where land is cheap, is, of cour&s;e, much higher and more valuable than in old e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;tates, the intrin&s;ic value of the labour, in the propo&s;ed new &s;ettlement, might fairly be e&s;timated <HI>at double the price</HI> of labour in England; but at pre&s;ent I will rate it only at <HI>one &s;hilling per day,</HI> on ac|count of the limitation of eight hours in&s;tead of ten, commonly required in England. About 300 males have already entered their names; which number multiplied by &s;ixty-two, the tax of days work due from each per annum, by this regulation, will produce 18,600 days of labour in a year, due to the publick; which, e&s;timated at the low average rate of only 1s. per day, will amount to 930l.
<PB N="65" REF="66">per annum. And as the value or ex|pence of labour, when applied <HI>to land,</HI> (at the ordinary e&s;timation of increa&s;e by the products of the earth in return for labour and care) is expected to pro|duce <HI>at lea&s;t triple the amount</HI> of the di&s;bur&s;ement, even in our northern cli|mates, &s;o the value of 930l. be&s;towed in labour on the publick lots of land in the fertile and productive climate of Africa, where very little labour is nece&s;&s;ary, might certainly be e&s;timated much higher: but even at the ordinary rate it will amount to 2790l. per annum, which is a very great publick revenue, if it be remembered that it is calculated on the very &s;mall number of 300 males, reckon|ing rich and poor together, which are only the ordinary average number of males in an <HI>hundred divi&s;ion,</HI> or 100 families of a well e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;ettlement, at the rate of three males to a family!</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="67">The general contribution, which I have propo&s;ed, is <HI>equally</HI> laid on the poor as on the rich, the former being <HI>equally</HI> capable of paying it, and that certainly with more ea&s;e to them&s;elves, by being accu&s;tomed to <HI>ordinary labour.</HI> Neverthele&s;s the rich (it may be &s;aid) ought to contribute more than the poor, on account of the &s;uperior advantages which accrue to them by their a&s;&s;ocia|tion with the poor in one well regulated political body. The &s;uperior advantages I &s;peak of are&mdash;1&s;t, The <HI>per&s;onal ea&s;e</HI> or exemption from labour, which their riches may always procure to them in &s;uch a &s;ociety&mdash;and &s;econdly the effec|tual &s;ecurity of their property, or wealth, <HI>procured in Frankpledge,</HI> or <HI>"Maxima &s;ecuritas,"</HI> by the equal exertion of per&s;ons, who have <HI>no property,</HI> and by an <HI>equal</HI> ri&s;que, al&s;o <HI>of their lives,</HI> in ca&s;e of actual danger. So that it &s;eems clearly rea&s;onable and ju&s;t, that the rich
<PB N="67" REF="68">and higher ranks of citizens &s;hould contribute <HI>more to the publick revenue,</HI> than the poor;&mdash;but in what proportion is rather difficult to determine; though it may be readily an&s;wered, that the quantity of riches &s;hould, in due pro|portion, determine the quantity of con|tribution; yet this cannot be done with|out a general <HI>tax on property,</HI> which, as experience teaches us, is liable to many inconveniences; &s;o that even the antient and ordinary tax of <HI>tithes</HI> to the clergy is deemed grievou&s;ly inconvenient, on account of the difficulties, di&s;putes, quarrels, and vexations, which too fre|quently happen, as well in compound|ing for them as in the collection of them <HI>in kind.</HI> The only expedient, therefore, which I am able to devi&s;e, at pre&s;ent, for procuring a larger contribution from the rich, is a <HI>tax on pride and indolence;</HI> a tax which, though it will not produce in exact proportion to the property of
<PB N="68" REF="69">the wealthy, will neverthele&s;s mo&s;t cer|tainly obtain from the wealthy and luxurious a contribution exactly pro|portionate to whatever <HI>pride and indo|lence</HI> may be occa&s;ioned by the &s;uper|fluous wealth of the community: and in aid to this tax on <HI>&s;uperfluous wealth,</HI> the <HI>affluence</HI> likewi&s;e of the more u&s;eful members of &s;ociety, who&s;e employments procure them a more profitable reward than they could obtain by ordinary la|bour, might be made to yield a rea&s;on|able addition to the revenue in con&s;ide|ration of their &s;uperior abilities to con|tribute, which men of this re&s;pectable cla&s;s certainly have.</P>

<P><PB N="74" REF="75">Thus an ample &s;ource is opened not only of <HI>publick credit</HI> but al&s;o of <HI>private &s;ecurity,</HI> or tru&s;t, in traffick, by the &s;ame ea&s;y means; whereby poor labouring men may be enabled to obtain all the nece&s;&s;ary articles of merchandize, though they have no ready money to advance. For, as <HI>ordinary labour</HI> is rendered the <HI>medium of traffic,</HI> in&s;tead of ca&s;h, the fir&s;t advantage to a poor indu&s;trious man, ac|cu&s;tomed only to <HI>ordinary labour,</HI> is, that he will, at all times, have it in his power to obtain employment; in the &s;earch of which, with us, many hone&s;t men, in all the three kingdoms, are ob|liged to leave their native country. And the &s;econd material advantage to him is, that he can always obtain an immediate credit, proportionable to the value of his unengaged time, for any articles of trade that he may want, by giving the <HI>mer|chant,</HI> or <HI>trade&s;man,</HI> in return for them, an indenture for as many <HI>days labour</HI> as
<PB N="75" REF="76">the purcha&s;e is worth; and he is al&s;o enabled to employ a <HI>black&s;mith, car|penter,</HI> or other u&s;eful <HI>artificer</HI> (in ca&s;e he &s;hould want their a&s;&s;i&s;tance on his own lot) by giving them, in like manner, an indenture, for as many days of <HI>or|dinary labour,</HI> as will amount to the value of the work. The&s;e indentures (as before propo&s;ed for the indentures of general contribution) &s;hould expre&s;s the names of the <HI>hundred,</HI> and of the <HI>dozen</HI> in which the &s;igner is a&s;&s;ociated, and &s;hould be previou&s;ly carried by him to be entered at the public Exchequer, or bank, of the hundred, and be there properly certified, as before propo&s;ed; after which the labourer may cut off the indentures from his checques, at the printed tally, and pay them to the <HI>mer|chant</HI> or <HI>trade&s;man,</HI> for the article pur|cha&s;ed; or to the <HI>artificer</HI> for his job, retaining the checques in his own cu&s;tody, that he may always know the
<PB N="76" REF="77">amount of his <HI>debt of labour.</HI> On the other hand, the <HI>merchant, trade&s;man,</HI> or <HI>artificer,</HI> who receives &s;uch an indenture from a poor labourer, can immediately <HI>realize</HI> the value of it in his own favour, by paying it into the public Exchequer, or bank of the town&s;hip; where, of cour&s;e, it will be po&s;ted to the credit of his accompt of labour, and will enable him to redeem a part of his <HI>own inden|tures,</HI> without his <HI>own per&s;onal labour,</HI> which, of cour&s;e, is much more valuable than <HI>ordinary labour;</HI> and in like manner he will proceed with all other indentures for <HI>ordinary labour,</HI> that he has procured by his traffic, or more valuable occupa|tion, always paying them to the credit of his account at the bank, until the amount exceeds his own debt for public &s;ervice: when, from the balance of labour in his favour, according to the amount of it, he will always be at liberty to draw on the bank for <HI>indentures of days
<PB N="77" REF="78">work,</HI> either for <HI>circulation,</HI> as ready ca&s;h, or for <HI>labourers,</HI> to cultivate his own lot of land, or el&s;e occa&s;ionally to accom|modate planters who want labourers, and are willing to pay the value of them, in <HI>produce,</HI> &amp;c. whereby <HI>private credit</HI> (as well as <HI>public credit,</HI> already provided for) will be amply &s;upported: and the indentures for <HI>labour,</HI> by which this mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential <HI>public</HI> and <HI>private</HI> &s;ervice is effected, will be, in fact, A PAPER CURRENCY OF INTRINSIC VALUE, an|&s;wering all the purpo&s;es of <HI>ready ca&s;h,</HI> as a medium of traffic, as well as all the nece&s;&s;ary purpo&s;es of <HI>negociable bills,</HI> to &s;upport <HI>public</HI> and <HI>private</HI> credit; and yet they cannot be, at all, liable to de|preciation!</P>
<P>The advantages appear to me &s;o great and extraordinary, that I can hardly give credit, as I proceed, to my own e&s;tima|tion of them; and am inclined to &s;u&s;pect
<PB N="78" REF="79">that I am, in &s;ome way or other, <HI>enor|mou&s;ly mi&s;taken;</HI> but as I cannot yet find out my error, I mu&s;t leave my cen&s;ure to &s;ome more able head. A few obvious objections, however, I am prepared to remove by a timely propo&s;al of adequate remedies. As for in&s;tance&mdash;Whatever might be deemed trouble&s;ome, or di&s;|agreeable, in exacting the payment of the&s;e <HI>debts of labour,</HI> may be effectually withdrawn <HI>from individuals,</HI> by inve&s;ting the <HI>public bank of each town&s;hip</HI> with the &s;ole authority of demanding the <HI>labour</HI> for the indentures, that have been re|&s;pectively entered and certified therein. And that the &s;everal banks may be enabled to realize the value of the&s;e indentures, all applications either for <HI>labourers,</HI> or <HI>labour,</HI> &s;hall be made at the &s;everal <HI>town banks;</HI> where planters may be &s;ure of a &s;upply of labourers, and the labourer equally &s;ure of a con&s;tant &s;upply of work, without danger of op|pre&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="79" REF="80">or non payment of wages, being &s;ecured from both by the media|tion of the bank, which employs him, and di&s;po&s;es of his &s;ervice. And both parties, or at lea&s;t the <HI>planters,</HI> ought to pay &s;ome &s;mall allowance per cent. to the bank, by way of commi&s;&s;ion, or profit for the negociation. And each bank &s;hould regularly &s;ummon, (with <HI>due previous notice</HI> for every day) a &s;uf|ficient number of the indentured la|bourers that are entered on their books, not only to cultivate <HI>the public lots of land</HI> under their care, but al&s;o to &s;upply the current daily demand of labour that may be wanted by planters and other private individuals; but all per&s;ons &s;um|moned to labour, &s;hall work on the <HI>public lots,</HI> until &s;uch demands are made, by which means <HI>the labourers will lo&s;e no time in waiting for work.</HI> The daily &s;um|mon&s;es to labour, i&s;&s;ued from the bank, &s;hould be made <HI>in due rotation, according
<PB N="80" REF="81">to the dates of the indentures entered on the books,</HI> and according to the quantity of debt which each individual has to work out. And, that no man may run deeper in debt, by di&s;po&s;ing of his labour to a greater amount than he may be able to di&s;charge in due time, all indentures what&s;oever for the labour either of ap|prentices or &s;ervants, &s;hould be entered at the bank of the town&s;hip, where the parties re&s;ide, whereby not only the &s;tate of every labourer's debt may be always known, and, of cour&s;e, likewi&s;e his ability to di&s;charge it, but al&s;o, on the other hand, the labourers, apprentices, and &s;ervants them&s;elves, will be thereby more ea&s;ily protected from the oppre&s;&s;ion of &s;uch avaritious ma&s;ters, as might other|wi&s;e be inclined to exact more &s;ervice than is due by the terms of their contract.</P>
<P>If any per&s;on &s;hould die before his indentured &s;ervice is di&s;charged to the
<PB N="81" REF="82"><HI>public</HI> bank, his land, &s;tock, and effects &s;hall be an&s;werable to the amount of his deficiency to the <HI>publick,</HI> in preference to all other debts: whereby the <HI>paper currency,</HI> will always pre&s;erve a <HI>&s;tandard value;</HI> and, at the &s;ame time, afford a mo&s;t convenient medium for traffic and exchange. If any further difficulties, more than I have fore&s;een and guarded again&s;t, &s;hould &s;till be objected, I flatter my&s;elf that the &s;alutary e&s;tabli&s;hment of Frankpledge will be &s;ufficient to obviate them all. For this <HI>maxima &s;ecuritas,</HI> renders every individual completely re|&s;pon&s;ible for all debts or demands that can ju&s;tly be made upon him, and for all charges again&s;t him whatever, becau&s;e the re&s;idence of the meane&s;t member of &s;ociety can be mo&s;t expeditiou&s;ly known by the public books; &s;o that he may be immediately traced at any time to his very chamber, and no individual in <HI>Frankpledge</HI> can re&s;i&s;t the united power
<PB N="82" REF="83">of a free people&mdash;for if any one &s;hould neglect or de&s;pi&s;e the &s;ummons of the public bank, his <HI>tithing</HI> or dozen may be compelled (on the penalty of a heavy fine for neglect) to produce him: and &s;hould the tithing or dozen neglect, the hundred is &s;ummoned to enforce &s;atis|faction, and &s;o on with re&s;pect to higher divi&s;ions, until the &s;trength of the whole community is united, as one man, to render executive ju&s;tice, to <HI>fine,</HI> or other|wi&s;e puni&s;h all contumacious delinquents again&s;t common &s;en&s;e, and to enforce obedience to the determined ju&s;tice of the majority. This occa&s;ional mention of <HI>mi&s;demeanors</HI> and <HI>fines,</HI> reminds me that I have omitted to add to the amount of my calculation of <HI>Revenue,</HI> the profit of the <HI>public fines</HI> and <HI>forfeitures,</HI> which mu&s;t always be very con&s;iderable where <HI>Frankpledge</HI> is e&s;tabli&s;hed; not only, becau&s;e the regularity and order of the &s;y&s;tem renders the levying of <HI>fines</HI> and
<PB N="83" REF="84"><HI>forfeitures</HI> extremely ea&s;y, expeditious, and free from expence, but al&s;o, becau&s;e the penalties of <HI>fines</HI> and <HI>forfeitures</HI> are, in Frankpledge, extended to the <HI>minute&s;t immoralities,</HI> and <HI>negligences,</HI> in order to render the peace and regularity of &s;ociety as perfect as po&s;&s;ible. Add to this a very particular advantage, which the ancient mode of puni&s;hing by <HI>fines</HI> and <HI>forfeitures,</HI> will acquire by the applica|tion of my propo&s;al of univer&s;al calcula|tion by <HI>days labour</HI>&mdash;an advantage which could never before be obtained; viz. that the <HI>poore&s;t man</HI> has, thereby, <HI>&s;ome|thing to forfeit,</HI> even &s;ometimes very con&s;iderable, becau&s;e his <HI>per&s;onal labour</HI> is <HI>equally valuable,</HI> and probably <HI>more &s;o,</HI> than the labour of a man of &s;uperior rank; &s;o that even the happy &s;y&s;tem of <HI>Frankpledge it&s;elf</HI> is very materially im|proved, and rendered much <HI>more effectual,</HI> as well as more <HI>profitable,</HI> by the pro|po&s;ed addition.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="85">All contempts of legal &s;ummon&s;es to <HI>labour,</HI> would, of cour&s;e, be <HI>finable;</HI> as al&s;o <HI>apparent &s;loth,</HI> or <HI>remi&s;&s;ne&s;s in work|ing;</HI> both of which would thereby be made <HI>effectual to increa&s;e the value of the paper currency,</HI> in&s;tead of dimini&s;hing it, as might be expected. Likewi&s;e all con|tempts of court, neglects of &s;ummons to attend juries; want of punctuality in attending the duties of Watch and Ward, in the rotation of the public ro&s;ter; and all inattention or di&s;obedience while on duty; all breaches of the &s;abbath, &s;wear|ing, drunkenne&s;s, and immode&s;ty, as well as <HI>fornication</HI> and <HI>adultery</HI> (both of which &s;hould be very &s;trictly, and very &s;everely mulcted, for the more effectual promotion of <HI>honourable marriage</HI>) giving or accepting a challenge to fight, even though no mi&s;chief &s;hould en&s;ue; all unnece&s;&s;ary wrangling, fighting, or &s;triking, and even every wilful provoca|tion by word or ge&s;ture, and every other
<PB N="85" REF="86">mi&s;behaviour that is incon&s;i&s;tent with the peace, order, and quiet of a happy &s;o|ciety, would be puni&s;hed by a &s;uitable <HI>fine of days' work,</HI> in proportion to the offence, by which altogether this e&s;&s;ential article of <HI>fines</HI> and <HI>forfeitures</HI> (which, in England, through <HI>neglect of Frankpledge,</HI> are hardly an object of con&s;ideration) would nece&s;&s;arily occa&s;ion a much larger addition to the <HI>public revenue</HI> than I can venture, at pre&s;ent, to e&s;timate; and, therefore, I mu&s;t beg leave to <HI>re&s;erve</HI> this valuable article of <HI>fines,</HI> to make up any deficiencies, which, perhaps, may be afterwards di&s;covered in my other cal|culations; to which mu&s;t al&s;o be added, as a further re&s;erve, the profits ari&s;ing from the <HI>&s;ale of land</HI> for <HI>day labour,</HI> not yet e&s;timated, though it would probably amount even to more than the fines.</P>
<P>I have already, without the&s;e profitable articles, carried my e&s;timation of the
<PB N="86" REF="87"><HI>public Revenue</HI> nearly to the amount of 4000l. per annum, for every 100 families, including equally both rich and poor, which far exceeds the proportionable revenue, I believe, of any kingdom on earth; for indeed, the &s;ame means are <HI>not practicable</HI> in any country or nation, unle&s;s the mo&s;t excellent &s;y&s;tem of <HI>Frankpledge</HI> be previou&s;ly e&s;tabli&s;hed, which I mu&s;t frequently repeat. But, for the &s;ake of compari&s;on, let us apply this &s;cheme to the computed average number of taxable hou&s;es or families in England and Wales. The one million families (as they are commonly e&s;ti|mated) would rai&s;e, by merely taking on them&s;elves the very moderate and equal burthen of only a 5th part of their <HI>mo&s;t ordinary</HI> labour, e&s;timated at the low rate of one &s;hilling per day, together with the additional <HI>tax on pride,</HI> and the ea&s;y levy <HI>on profitable occupations,</HI> with the due increa&s;e of the whole profit, when applied
<PB N="87" REF="88">to <HI>the cultivation of public land,</HI> would rai&s;e (I &s;ay) at the rate of 3906l. for every hundred families, before calculated, the amazing revenue of 39 millions, and 60 thou&s;ands of pounds &s;terling, per annum. If I am que&s;tioned on the po&s;|&s;ibility of rai&s;ing a &s;um &s;o enormou&s;ly great, that it far exceeds the whole annual produce of all our accumulated taxes, cu&s;toms, and other means of revenue, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that I am at a lo&s;s how even to &s;atisfy my own doubts about it; and that I know not what rea&s;ons to a&s;&s;ign for &s;uch an incredible accumulation of wealth, ari&s;ing from &s;o <HI>trifling a burthen</HI> laid upon the people, unle&s;s it may be attri|buted to the <HI>effectual employment of all the labouring poor;</HI> and of others capable of labour, and al&s;o to the <HI>effectual</HI> means of which the propo&s;ition &s;eems to pro|mi&s;e of rendering that general employ|ment <HI>of ordinary labour</HI> profitable, not only in the circulation of the indentures
<PB N="88" REF="89">as <HI>bills</HI> and <HI>ca&s;h;</HI> but al&s;o in the increa&s;e which may be naturally expected from <HI>the actual labour, when applied to the earth.</HI> But there are other advantages attending the propo&s;al, which are not yet reckoned.</P>
<P>The previous re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of <HI>frankpledge,</HI> without which the rai&s;ing of &s;uch an increa&s;ed revenue could not be practicable, would, at the &s;ame time, render ab&s;olutely <HI>unnece&s;&s;ary</HI> the greate&s;t part of our mo&s;t expen&s;ive e&s;tabli&s;hments both <HI>civil</HI> and <HI>military.</HI></P>
<P>So that, upon the whole the gain might fairly be e&s;timated at nearly triple the <HI>effective,</HI> or neat amount of all the other devi&s;eable "<HI>Ways and Means,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c."&mdash; That this is not an exaggerated &s;tatement of our publick burthens, will be allowed, I believe, by all parties. I wi&s;h they were equally agreed in opinion about the nece&s;&s;ary remedy!</P>
