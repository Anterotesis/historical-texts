<Q>Only fear the Lord, and &s;erve him in Truth, with all your Heart; for con&s;ider how great Things he hath done for you.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IF all the Affairs of this lower World were either whirled about, by the Giddine&s;s of Chance, or entirely go|verned by the Sullenne&s;s of Fate, it would &s;trike a Damp upon all our Spirits; and this World, to all rational Beings that can fear and e&s;timate, all future Contin|gencies, would be, a mo&s;t gloomy, and melancholy Place.</P>
<P>And if all the wonderful, and &s;urpri|&s;ing Revolutions, in this Life, depended upon the Policy, and Wi&s;dom of tho&s;e
<PB N="2" REF="4">that are the Agents, in bringing mighty Things to pa&s;s, (&s;ince the greate&s;t Weights, many times, are &s;upported by the mo&s;t &s;lender Wires, and Succe&s;s in all extraor|dinary Undertakings, depends upon the happy Concurrences of innumerable Ac|didents, upon favourable Sea&s;ons, and a thou&s;and Circum&s;tances, as various and uncertain as the Weather;) the nice&s;t Politicians would be lo&s;t, and di&s;ap|pointed; and they, in the P&s;almi&s;t's Phra&s;e, would <HI>reel to and fro,</HI> and be <HI>at their Wits end.</HI></P>
<P>But, how wi&s;e &s;oever vain Men would be, this World is no more governed, than it was created by Chance; and he that made it, is only able to govern it. We are neither under the Power of Chance, nor determined by po&s;itive, and inexorable Fate; we do not depend upon politick In&s;titutions; but are now a&s;&s;embled to give Glory unto the Great God, who rules the Armies of Heaven, and the In|habitants of the lower Regions; who&s;e Power is infinite, and who&s;e Mercy is over all his Works; who <HI>is the Hope of
<PB N="3" REF="5">all that dwell on the Earth, and of them that remain in the broad Sea,</HI> P&s;. lxv. 5. <HI>The Lord is King, the Earth may be glad thereof; yea, the Multitude of the I&s;les may be glad thereof,</HI> P&s;. xcvii. 1. <HI>We will re|joice in thy Salvation, and triumph in the Name of the Lord our God. We will offer unto him the Sacrifice of Thank&s;giving, and tell out his Works with Gladne&s;s,</HI> P&s;. cvii. 22. And no Nation under Hea|ven had ever more Rea&s;on to do &s;o, than we have upon this pre&s;ent Solemnity.</P>
<P>And the &s;ignal In&s;tances of God's Pro|vidence, are &s;o illu&s;triou&s;ly vi&s;ible, that we cannot, but with the deepe&s;t Grati|tude, adore him <HI>that &s;itteth above the Water Floods, and remaineth a King for ever,</HI> P&s;. xxix. 9. <HI>Oh! that Men would prai&s;e the Lord for his Goodne&s;s, and de|clare the Wonders that he doth for the Chil|dren of Men,</HI> P&s;. cvii. 21.</P>
<P>In order to this, I would earne&s;tly re|commend, the Advice of <HI>Samuel,</HI> a wi&s;e, an experienced, a faithful Governor, who &s;corned to be bribed, or to rai&s;e his For|tunes
<PB N="4" REF="6">upon the Ruins of the People; who abhorred all Artifices to enrich him&s;elf, and &s;olemnly appeals to all the People, as Witne&s;&s;es of his Integrity: <HI>Here I am,</HI> produce your Evidences, I offer my&s;elf to a publick Trial, <HI>before the Lord, and be|fore his Anointed.</HI> Ver. 3. <HI>Who&s;e Ox have I taken? or who&s;e A&s;s have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppre&s;&s;ed? or at who&s;e Hand have I re|ceived any Bribe, to blind mine Eyes there|with? and I will re&s;tore it you.</HI> And he received this publick Te&s;timony, <HI>Thou ha&s;t not defrauded us, neither ha&s;t thou taken ought of any Man's Hand.</HI> And they ratify the Sentence, <HI>the Lord is Wit|ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>This admirable Per&s;on, who had long governed them with &s;uch Courage and Fidelity, that the wor&s;t of his Enemies could, in no Ca&s;e, charge him with Male-admini&s;tration; yet all his Merits were ungratefully &s;lighted, and the People, (that never want Occa&s;ion to pick Quar|rels with their Governor) whil&s;t they ac|quit the Judge, yet murmur at his Age;
<PB N="5" REF="7">for that had di&s;abled him to travel his u&s;ual Circuits; and they charged his Sons for perverting Judgment, and he mu&s;t re|&s;ign the Government to plea&s;e the People. But the&s;e high Provocations had no ill Effect upon him. Oh! the va&s;t Differ|ence betwixt tho&s;e, that have no Aims but the publick Good, and tho&s;e that have private Intere&s;ts of their own to &s;erve! He chearfully re&s;igns it, but with unpa|ralleled, conde&s;cending Goodne&s;s; after he &s;hewed them that he was &s;till the Favourite of Heaven, how ungratefully &s;oever they u&s;ed him upon Earth. At his powerful Prayers, God terrified them with Thunder, and &s;oftened them with Rain, and prepared them for the mo&s;t concerning Advice.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the highe&s;t Ingratitude, and Barbarity to his Per&s;on and Family, the brave aged Judge thus addre&s;&s;es him|&s;elf to all the People: <HI>As for me, God for|bid that I &s;hould &s;in again&s;t the Lord, in cea&s;ing to pray for you,</HI> Ver. 23.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="8">All the Injuries that they had done him, could not rai&s;e the lea&s;t Thought of Revenge; he would not offend Al|mighty God, by any thing that looked like Re&s;entment. Let them de&s;pi&s;e his Council, if they plea&s;ed; yet he, who was very well acquainted with what would mo&s;t contribute to a national Pro&s;perity; after he had excellently rea&s;oned, before the Lord, of the righteous Acts, that he did to them, and to their Fathers, leaves this Advice with them: <HI>Only fear the Lord, and &s;erve him in Truth, with all your Hearts; for con&s;ider how great Things he has done for you.</HI></P>
<P>Permit me, therefore, to reflect upon the&s;e &s;everal Parts which are expre&s;&s;ed in the Text.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The great Things God hath done for us.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Secondly,</HI> The Duty of con&s;idering how great they are.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="7" REF="9"><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The Obligation that lies upon us, to <HI>fear and &s;erve him, in Truth, with all our Hearts; that hath wrought &s;uch wonderful Works.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Should I look back to former Genera|tions, and peru&s;e the Hi&s;tories of our Church, and Nation; both the one, and the other, have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted by Miracles; and the Indications of God Almighty's Goodne&s;s, have been writ, in the brighte&s;t and the cleare&s;t Characters; writ, as it were, with a Sun-beam; with equal Per|&s;picuity and Certainty, that we have not been left to Gue&s;&s;es and Conjectures. But we might, upon &s;ure Grounds, take up the Expre&s;&s;ions of the Royal Prophet, <HI>P&s;.</HI> xxxi. 23. <HI>Thou ha&s;t, O God! &s;hewed us marvellous Kindne&s;s in a &s;trong City, in thy holy Church:</HI> And that Church may apply tho&s;e Words to it&s;elf, <HI>The Lord is my Rock, and my Fortre&s;s, and my Deli|verer; my Shield, the Horn of my Salva|tion; my high Tower, and my Refuge; my Saviour;</HI> every Thing that can imply Se|curity and Protection, <HI>P&s;.</HI> xviii. 1.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10">For, fir&s;t, if this be a Character of the Divine Aid, that God lets Things come to the utmo&s;t Extremity, before he makes <HI>bare his Arm;</HI> and &s;o the P&s;almi&s;t, in a very pathetical, but unu&s;ual Addre&s;s, &s;eems, in&s;tead of petitioning, to dictate and pre&s;cribe: <HI>Thou &s;halt ari&s;e, and have Mercy upon Sion, for why? The Time is come, to favour her; yea, the &s;et Time is come; and why? Thy Servants think upon her Stones, and it pities them to &s;ee her in the Du&s;t,</HI> P&s;. cii. 13, 14.</P>
<P>And if it be a very good Rea&s;on why God &s;hould then appear, that they may know that this is thy Hand, and thou Lord ha&s;t done it; I need not look abroad for foreign In&s;tances, &s;ince we have &s;o many flagrant ones at Home.</P>
<P>We cannot forget how mi&s;erably we were di&s;tre&s;&s;ed on every Side; without were Fightings, and within were Fears; we all lay trembling under ambiguous Expectations, impatiently waiting the Event of the Enemies Attack by Sea or
<PB N="9" REF="11">Land. And when va&s;t Armies were ready to invade us, and our never enough to be lamented Divi&s;ions gave Force, and Spirit, to their Enterprizes; all their &s;an|guine Hopes were wonderfully di&s;ap|pointed, by Him, that hath the &s;ecret Springs of Nature in his Hands, and can turn and manage them as he plea&s;es: The Winds kept the formidable Navies in their Harbours; and they could not move, without his Permi&s;&s;ion, whom the Winds and the Sea obey.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> It is another evident Cha|racter of God Almighty's appearing for a Nation, when &s;everal Events, that are managed by different Per&s;ons, and in dif|ferent Places, do happily con&s;pire, to com|pleat a national Joy.</P>
<P>When the Illu&s;trious young Hero, (Duke <HI>WILLIAM,</HI> Generali&s;&s;imo of his Ma|je&s;ty's Forces in <HI>North-Britain</HI>) had &s;pent the Sea&s;on of the Year &s;o far, that he had been fatigued with long Marches, and the People were faint and weary; that then, he &s;hould have the
<PB N="10" REF="12">Courage to attempt, and be &s;ucce&s;sful, in &s;o difficult an Enterprize, as to &s;torm &s;trong Garri&s;ons, and take fortified Towns; and &s;lay, and take Pri&s;oners at the Battle of <HI>Straghallen-Moor,</HI> (near <HI>Culloden-Hou&s;e</HI>) above three thou&s;and Rebels, and &s;ix hundred Pri&s;oners, and put the re&s;t to Flight, when the Rebels were &s;uperior in Number to us, was a grateful Sur|prize, to all that heard it. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, who did not give us as a Prey unto their Teeth. This is the Lord's Doings, and it is marvellous in our Eyes, for which we will rejoice and give Thanks.</HI> And we cannot but break out in the famous Epinikion of the celebrated <HI>Deborah,</HI> Judges v. 31. <HI>So let all thy Enemies peri&s;h, O Lord! But let them that love him, be as the Sun, when he goeth forth in his Might.</HI></P>
<P>What an amazing, tho' joyful Sight, mu&s;t it be to the King's Army? to &s;ee the robu&s;t Highland Rebels (tho&s;e Gy|gantick Sons of <HI>Anach</HI>) fall before the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Fire, like &s;turdy Oaks reft before a Sheet of irre&s;i&s;table Lightening. Thanks
<PB N="11" REF="13">be to God, who hath given us the Vic|tory over the Enemies of his true Reli|gion, e&s;tabli&s;hed among&s;t us; Enemies, who&s;e wicked De&s;igns were, to &s;et up Super&s;tition and Popery, Idolatry, and arbitrary Power, in its &s;tead: <HI>For they intended Mi&s;chief again&s;t thee, and ima|gined &s;uch a Device, as they were not able to perform: Therefore did&s;t thou put them to Flight, and the Strings of thy Bow ha&s;t thou made ready again&s;t them: Be thou exalted, Lord, in thy own Strength, &s;o will we &s;ing, and prai&s;e thy Power.</HI> P&s;. xxi. 11, 12, 13. But, as if <HI>Europe</HI> was not a Theatre wide enough for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Triumphs, they are extended to the remote&s;t Regions, <HI>Cape-Breton,</HI> in <HI>North-America,</HI> has &s;een, and felt, the the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Courage; and tho&s;e Ve&s;&s;els of the <HI>French,</HI> which were looked on as invincible, have been taken.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Another Character of God Al|mighty's appearing for a People, is, when &s;ome of the <HI>Nimrods,</HI> &s;ome of the &s;uc|ce&s;sful Troublers of the World, that come up to the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI>'s elegant De&s;crip|tion,
<PB N="12" REF="14">Chap. xiv. 13. <HI>Thou &s;aid&s;t, in thy Heart, I will a&s;cend into Heaven, and I will exalt my Throne above the Stars of God; I will a&s;cend above the Heights of the Clouds; I will be like the Mo&s;t High:</HI> That re&s;olve to extend their Empires, and aim at Univer&s;al Monarchy, by Fraud and Violence, by Blood and Rapine; that are &s;welled with Panegyricks, and flattered by Devices; whil&s;t they are compared to the va&s;t Luminaries of Hea|ven; and are told, that they can no more be interrupted, in their Victories and Triumphs, than the Cour&s;e of the Sun can be arre&s;ted. When &s;uch a Prince as this, feels the Weight of that Omni|potence which he has defy'd; when his powerful Navies are di&s;abled, and his Trea&s;ures exhau&s;ted, and he re&s;trained from his bloody Per&s;ecutions, it is na|tural to apply, in the Prophet's Words, <HI>How art thou fallen from Heaven, O! Lucifer, Sun of the Morning. Is this the Man that made the Earth to trem|ble? that did &s;hake Kingdoms? that made the World as a Wilderne&s;s? and de&s;troyed the Cities thereof? For if the Lord of
<PB N="13" REF="15">Ho&s;ts do purpo&s;e, who &s;hall di&s;annul it? and if his Hand be &s;tretched out, who &s;hall turn it back?</HI> I&s;a. xiv. 12, 17.</P>
<P>So that if the Sea&s;onablene&s;s of Events, when Things are almo&s;t at a Cri&s;is; if the Concurrence of various pro&s;perous Events, in di&s;tant Places, and Countries, and Nations; and the Pre&s;ervation of Per&s;ons of that Figure, and Eminency, that the Succe&s;s does depend very much upon them, as the proper In&s;truments to procure it: If the &s;temming the impe|tuous Torrent, and putting a Check to the Overflowing of Ungodline&s;s, Rebel|lion, and Oppre&s;&s;ion; and reducing the&s;e extravagant, and exorbitant Plunderers and Rebels: If the&s;e be Employments worthy of Providence, <HI>Not unto us, O Lord! not unto us, but to thy great Name, be a&s;cri|bed the Glory and Prai&s;e,</HI> P&s;al. cxv. 1. We have Rea&s;on to conclude, that God has done great Things for us: Which was the fir&s;t Part I propo&s;ed to &s;peak to.</P>
<P>I now proceed to the &s;econd.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="16">The Duty of con&s;idering how great they are.</P>
<P>How great are the Calamities we are freed from? How great is the Happine&s;s that we enjoy? Both the one and the other require our calm, and &s;erious Reflections; as we would e&s;cape the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI>'s &s;evere, but ju&s;t Reproof, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> v. 12. <HI>The Harp and the Viol, the Tabret and the Pipe, and Wine, are in their Fea&s;ts; but they regard not the Work of the Lord, neither con&s;ider the Operations of his Hands.</HI></P>
<P>Is it nothing in our Eyes? that God hath &s;hewed a more di&s;tingui&s;hing Care of us, than of any Nation in the whole World be&s;ides? that he hath &s;o fre|quently interpo&s;ed, and &s;natched us from between the very Teeth, and Jaws of the De&s;troyer?</P>
<P>I need not lead you into antient Hi&s;|tory; I mu&s;t pre&s;cribe &s;ome Limits, for I would not launch into a Sea of Matter.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="17">Be plea&s;ed to con&s;ider, how lamen|table our Ca&s;e had been, if the united Powers of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> had as much di&s;abled our naval Forces, as we have done theirs, &s;ince the War fir&s;t broke out: Had their Succe&s;s been equal to ours, how mi&s;erable, beyond Expre&s;&s;ion, had our Condition been? A powerful Navy are the be&s;t Walls, that can en|compa&s;s an I&s;land. It is an illu&s;trious, and a terrible Defence. It is our Glory at Home; it is our Honour and Security Abroad: It looks in our Channel like a lovely Valley of tall Cedars: It hath a &s;weet, and awful, and maje&s;tick Pre|&s;ence.</P>
<P>And if this (which God of his infinite Mercy forbid) &s;hould ever be de&s;troyed, how wretched, how contemptible, how weak, how poor, and incon&s;iderable a Nation &s;hould we be? How would our neighbouring Kingdoms clap their Hands, and hi&s;s at us? How &s;hould we become a By-word, and a Proverb of Reproach, to all that are round about us?</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="18">Is it nothing to us, that our re&s;tle&s;s, our powerful, our implacable Enemies, have not yet been able to extirpate the Northern Here&s;y, (as they &s;tile it) that is, the Prote&s;tant Religion? Neither by open Violence, nor in&s;idious and treacherous Attempts? That with all their Art, they have not been able to root up our Foun|dations, and introduce Super&s;tition and Idolatry, and de&s;troy the Products of the ble&s;&s;ed Reformation; which con&s;i&s;ts in rejecting, what for many Years had been &s;uperadded, to the Chri&s;tian Religion, and received its glorious Fini&s;hing from <HI>an</HI> IMMORTAL QUEEN, who&s;e Memory grows every Year more illu&s;trious; and who&s;e Name (at &s;o great a Di&s;tance) is poured out, like precious Ointment, and &s;heds a refre&s;hing Fragrancy upon all the People.</P>
<P>Is it nothing, that our civil Rights, are inviolably &s;ecured? That we enjoy the Fruit of our Ance&s;tors Labours, and the Effects of our own Indu&s;try? That our admirable Con&s;titution, and our ex|cellent
<PB N="17" REF="19">Laws, render us happy, to the Envy of our Neighbours; as happy as good Men could de&s;ire to be, and as &s;e|cure from bad, as the Ju&s;tice, and the Wi&s;dom of the Laws can make us?</P>
<P>Is it nothing? that the Sea&s;ons of the Year, which were lately &s;o &s;trangely al|tered, that the heavenly Bodies &s;eemed angry, and di&s;plea&s;ed, and refu&s;ed their favourable A&s;pects? Ill News and bad Weather, made Men re&s;tle&s;s, and unea&s;y; and the great Reviver of Mankind, the Sun, looked &s;ullenly, and was generally wrapt up in di&s;mal Clouds. Is it no|thing? that our Scarcity (fre&s;h in all your Memories) is turned into Plenty? That &s;ome Men begin to repine at it, as their Burden; and complain as vehemently, for the Cheapne&s;s of the Fruits of the Earth, as they did, not long &s;ince, for the Scar|city, and Dearne&s;s of them. O! con&s;ider this, and lay it clo&s;e to your Hearts; and improve it, in your mo&s;t devout and grate|ful Acknowledgments.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="20">And let it always be remembered, for the Honour of this Day, <Q>When Cha|racters engraved in Bra&s;s &s;hall di&s;ap|pear, as if they were written in Du&s;t; when Elogies committed to the Tru&s;t of Marbles, &s;hall be illegible, as whi&s;|pered Accents; when Pyramids di&s;|&s;olved, &s;hall want them&s;elves a Monu|ment to evidence, they were once &s;o much as Ruin.</Q> I &s;ay, let it be re|corded, for the Honour of this Day; <HI>let it be wrote with an Iron Pen, and Lead, in the Rock for ever,</HI> Job xix. 24. that the Battle (near <HI>Culloden-Hou&s;e, April</HI> 16. 1746) was terrible and deci&s;ive; that the Highland Rebels were conquered; that the <HI>French,</HI> who joined them, were taken Pri&s;oners; that tho&s;e to whom Quarter was given, were ungrateful; and that his ROYAL HIGHNESS, <HI>WILLIAM,</HI> Duke of <HI>Cumberland,</HI> Generali&s;&s;imo of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Forces, at that Battle, behaved with the Conduct and Bravery of an Hero

<PB N="21" REF="23">Behaviour at our Fea&s;ting, kindle God's Wrath again&s;t us. The&s;e joyful Days, &s;hould engage us in all charitable Offices. Let us open both our Hands, and our Hearts, and &s;end Portions to the Poor; that there may be no Heart &s;ad, when God has given us &s;uch a triumphant Oc|ca&s;ion for our publick Joy. And the &s;in|cere&s;t Expre&s;&s;ions of it, are di&s;covered, in <HI>&s;erving him in Truth, with all our Hearts.</HI></P>
<P>To him, our mo&s;t gracious, and mer|ciful God, our Shield, and our Rock, and our mighty Deliverer, who hath &s;et us free from the Northern Rebels, and, we hope and tru&s;t, from <HI>French</HI> Tyranny, and Popi&s;h Super&s;tition, a Yoke which neither we, nor our Fathers, were able to bear; who hath fru&s;trated the Coun&s;els, and bla&s;ted the De&s;igns of wicked and unrea&s;onable Men; and made their mi&s;|chievous Councils, and Devices, to be of none Effect; who brings to light the hid|den Things of Darkne&s;s, and hath hither|to pre&s;erved our Religion, and civil Inte|re&s;ts, in De&s;pight of all the malicious and re&s;tle&s;s De&s;igns of our Adver&s;aries.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="24">Unto God, who hath &s;aved us, with &s;o great Salvation, let us give Thanks, from the Ground of the Heart: And that he may accept this Sacrifice of Prai&s;e, I &s;hall once more entreat you to comply with the Advice in the Text; for fear of the Judg|ments threatened in the following Ver&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Only fear the Lord, and &s;erve him in Truth, with all your Hearts; for con&s;ider how great Things he has done for you. But if ye &s;hall &s;till do wickedly, ye &s;hall be de|&s;troyed, both ye and your King.</HI></P>
