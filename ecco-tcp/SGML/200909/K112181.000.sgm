<HEAD>To the Right Honourable <HI>CHARLES</HI> EARL of HALLIFAX,
Fir&s;t Lord Commi&s;&s;ioner of the Trea|&s;ury, one of the Lords of His

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THE Obligations I have received from your Lord|&s;hip for many
Years pa&s;t, and the Continu|ance of them to this Time, <PB REF="3"> do
ju&s;tly call for a Publick Acknowledgment, on the fir&s;t Opportunity I had to
make it.</P>
<P>Having nothing of my own worth Pre&s;enting to your Lord&s;hip, I
have, with your Permi&s;&s;ion, dedi|cated &s;ome E&s;&s;ays of my Fa|ther's to
your Lord&s;hip's Peru&s;al.</P>
<P>I know how delicate a Ta&s;te your Lord&s;hip has; that you have
adorned your Mind both with Univer&s;ity and Polite Learning; &s;o that were I
not entirely &s;atisfied that the Thoughts in them are not common, (and were
they not my Father's, I <PB REF="4"> &s;hould &s;ay) that they are writ in the
&s;mooth Stile of a Courtier, with the Spi|rit and Air of a Gentleman, and with
the Strength of a Man of Letters, I &s;hou'd not have pre&s;um'd to have
in&s;crib'd your Lord&s;hip's Name before them.</P>
<P>How he was qualified to write the&s;e E&s;&s;ays, the Pre|face
mentions; I &s;hall only add, that during the Time of his Foreign Emba&s;&s;y,
which la&s;ted about Thirty Years, he laid out his Hours between Books, Men of
the mo&s;t polite Parts, and Affairs of the greate&s;t Mo|ment.</P>
<P><PB REF="5">He had the Plea&s;ure of near twenty Years Retire|ment
before his Death, (which was at a hundred and one) to recollect his
Ob&s;ervations of Men and Things, and put them in the Dre&s;s in which your
Lord&s;hip &s;ees them.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome of them indeed that &s;eem not to have pa&s;s'd
his la&s;t Hands, which therefore are not &s;o correct as they would have been,
had he liv'd to have fini&s;h'd them. But when I con&s;ider, that the fir&s;t
Draughts of a <HI>Raphael, Titi|an,</HI> or <HI>Reuben,</HI> are pre&s;erved
with great Care, tho' not <PB REF="6"> fini&s;h'd, I thought it be&s;t to let
them pa&s;s as they are.</P>
<P>The many great Services your Lord&s;hip has done the Publick have
been ex|pre&s;&s;ed by &s;o many, that it will be hard to avoid
Re|petition.</P>
<P>However, for a Noble|man, at the Head of Af|fairs at Court, to
move with a great Regard to the Liber|ty and Property of the Sub|ject, &s;teady
to the Reform'd Religion in the wor&s;t of Times, that advances not Prerogative
beyond its le|gal Bounds, that has the Good of the Nation at Heart, and that
acts with <PB REF="7"> great Sincerity, are Virtues that can never be
&s;ufficient|ly admir'd by all true <HI>En|gli&s;hmen,</HI> and particularly

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_I Think it nece&s;&s;ary to give &s;ome Account of the Author of
the fol|lowing E&s;&s;ays, and like|wi&s;e of the E&s;&s;ays them&s;elves; the
rather, becau&s;e being Po&s;thumous Works, the Genuine&s;s of them might be
otherwi&s;e doubted.</P>
<P>As for the Author, Sir <HI>Richard Bul&s;trode,</HI> he was the
Son of <HI>Edward Bul&s;trode</HI> of the <HI>Inner-Temple,</HI>
<ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who&s;e Reports are extant; he came abroad into the World
well &s;tock'd with Univer&s;ity Learning; was bred at the
<HI>Inner-Temple,</HI> call'd to the Bar, and practis'd as a Barri&s;ter, 'till
the Civil Wars breaking out, put a Stop to the Current of the Law; and 
<PB N="ii" REF="9"> being then a young Man, and of an active Spirit, betook
him&s;elf to the Army, and was of the Royal Side; where he behaved him&s;elf
&s;o well, that in a little time he was made Adjutant-General to the Army of
King <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t. After the Return of the Royal Family, he had
a Place at Court; &s;ome time after he was appointed to be at the Court of
<HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> as Re&s;ident from King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second; on
who&s;e Death he was made Envoy by King <HI>James</HI> the Second to the &s;ame
Court, his whole Mini&s;try there being about thirty Years; during which Time
he held Corre&s;pondence with mo&s;t of the Courts of <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI>
(as I find by his Letters made up into Annals, which I have by me.)</P>
<P>When his Royal Ma&s;ter retir'd to <HI>France,</HI> he went after
him, and &s;ub|mitted to his Fortune, and lived there in Retirement about
twenty Years; during which Time he had <PB N="iii" REF="10"> Opportunity to
compo&s;e the follow|ing E&s;&s;ays, which were the Re&s;ult of his own
Experience.</P>
<P>He had been a diligent Ob&s;erver of Mankind, through a long
Series of Time, having lived to an Hun|dred and one; had the Experience of
Courts, the Conver&s;ation of Men of the fir&s;t Quality, Generals, and Men of
Polite Learning: And having had great Variety of Fortune him&s;elf, was be&s;t
able to inform Mankind what is proper to be done in tho&s;e &s;everal Parts of
Life, in which he had been exerci&s;ed.</P>
<P>He looked back upon Life, after many Years enjoying it, with a
truer View, than Men u&s;ually do forward; for we look through a magnifying
Gla&s;s at Things to come, and think them much bigger, and more ex|cellent than
in Truth we find them. The Pro&s;pect of <HI>Canaan</HI> from Mount
<HI>Nebo,</HI> was more ravi&s;hing even to <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> than the
Enjoyment of it <PB N="iv" REF="11"> was afterwards to the
<HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> or would have been to him&s;elf. <HI>Solo|mon</HI> could
not have &s;poke &s;o feeling|ly of the Vanity of the Plea&s;ures of this Life,
had he not taken a full Draught of them. The Freedom of the Author's
Conver&s;ation, in his younger Years, (being a Man of a warm Temper, a great
deal of Wit and Genero&s;ity) having kept what we call the be&s;t Company, gave
him an Opportunity of looking back on the Mi&s;carriages, which young Gentlemen
are &s;ubject to, with u&s;eful Reflections and Remarks, and of &s;peaking more
ju&s;tly of tho&s;e Errors, than Clo&s;et Morali&s;ts u&s;ually do.</P>
<P>The Author would have &s;ent me the following E&s;&s;ays, to have
pub|li&s;hed in his Life-Time, had not the War between <HI>England</HI> and
<HI>France</HI> hinder'd it; but dying before that ended, he gave Directions to
his La|dy to &s;end them to me by the fir&s;t <PB N="v" REF="12"> Opportunity;
which &s;he accordingly did, being all of his own Hand Wri|ting.</P>
<P>So much for the Author.</P>
<P>As to the E&s;&s;ays them&s;elves:</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">I. E&s;&s;ay of Company and
Conver|&s;ation.</NOTE>That of Company and Conver&s;a|tion, &s;hews him to have
read Man|kind very throughly.</P>
<P>The Caution of chu&s;ing ones Com|pany, when to &s;peak, and when
not, when to break a Je&s;t, and when not, is very fit for all young Gentlemen
to know; his &s;hort, but &s;mart Re|flection on ob&s;cene Di&s;cour&s;es, is a
Proof of his Knowledge of the Go|vernment of the Tongue.</P>
<P>He Inveighs again&s;t the Sin of &s;coffing at Religion and
profane Swearing, with great Sharpne&s;s and a moving Sorrow. When a good Man
hears his Friend traduc'd, he defends him if he has Opportunity, or is in Pain
for want of it: Much more &s;hould every Chri&s;tian be con|cerned, when he
hears that Name <PB N="vi" REF="13"> prophaned, which ought not to be mentioned
without Reverence.</P>
<P>Nor does Detraction and Flattery e&s;cape a ju&s;t Cen&s;ure, tho'
he lived and dy'd in a Court.</P>
<P>His Rules of Conver&s;ation, with Superiors, Equals and Inferiors,
are well weighed and con&s;ider'd. As mo&s;t Men are free and open at Meals,
the Account he gives of his Witty Ma&s;ter King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, at
his private Suppers, with &s;ome &s;e|lect Per&s;ons, Men of Wit, is very
entertaining.</P>
<P>One General Rule he lays down, that &s;hould go through all the
Parts of Conver&s;ation, and that is Integri|ty, which is a Virtue too &s;eldom
pra|cti&s;ed. He avoids the Pedantry and Moto&s;ene&s;s of &s;evere
<HI>Cynicks</HI>; and tho' he highly commends plea&s;ant Con|ver&s;ation, Wit,
Mu&s;ick, and diver|ting Tales; yet he wi&s;ely cautions a|gain&s;t Picquant
Je&s;ts, which often breed Quarrels; and in all the&s;e <PB N="vii" REF="14">
Freedoms, has let nothing &s;lip from him, that is contrary to the Rules of
good <HI>Ethicks.</HI></P>
<P>Mirth thus guarded with Inno|cence, makes the Cup of Life go down
plea&s;antly, and leaves no Stain behind it, to wound the Con&s;cience. He has
truly &s;aid, that &s;ome Per&s;ons and Ca&s;es are privileg'd from Je&s;ts. As
Mens Deformity, Meanne&s;s of In|tellectuals, Poverty, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which
puts me in Mind of a Gentleman, who&s;e Wit lay only in ridiculing o|thers; and
having a poor Man that work'd for him, (who&s;e Shape was not deformed) would
be often tell|ing him he would give him five Pounds to &s;it for his Picture.
The Man thought 'twas in Deri&s;ion, would never be brought to it, but gave him
this &s;harp An&s;wer, <HI>That he would give five Pounds to laugh at a poor
Man, but would not give him a Shilling to buy him a Dinner.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="15">Which Gentleman, tho' he had then about two
thou&s;and Pounds a Year, yet afterwards lived to want a Shilling to buy
him&s;elf a Dinner.</P>
<P>His Account of Conver&s;ation with well cho&s;en Friends is very
delight|ful and in&s;tructive. I know nothing of this World comparable to the
Plea|&s;ures of Conver&s;ation, with wi&s;e, ho|ne&s;t and ingenious Friends,
except in the Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of doing our Du|ty to the mo&s;t High, and
the Rela|tions we &s;tand in, and the Peace of Mind, (I had almo&s;t &s;aid
Rapture) that re&s;ults from thence.</P>
<P>His Advice to Women, as to their Conver&s;ation with Men, is fit
for all Ladies to know; and &s;o it is for Men, that intend Cha&s;tity, not to
be too Conver&s;ant with pretty Wo|men; for 'tis ill making Gun-Pow|der in a
Smith's Shop.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">II. E&s;&s;ay of Solitarine&s;s and
Retire|ment.</NOTE>His Thoughts of Retirement are very philo&s;ophical, ju&s;t,
and of great Weight; and the prudent, and cau|tionary <PB N="ix" REF="16">
Rules he gives therein, of great U&s;e. He writes very feeling|ly on that
Subject, as what he found by Experience; the Art of Conver|&s;ation, and the
Art of Retirement, &s;eem to comprehend the whole Scene of humane Life, of both
which he appears to have been a perfect Ma|&s;ter, and to have given proper
Di|rections in each State and Condition of Life; he allows the Vigour of Life
to be &s;pent in publick Ser|vices, and the Remainder in Retire|ment, and
u&s;eful Reflections for the Benefit of Mankind. If he has car|ry'd Retirement
to greater Heights, than Men attached to the World can allow; it &s;hould be
con&s;ider'd, that when one is writing on a Plea&s;ure, at a time when one
enjoys it, it's hard to keep within the Bounds of moderate Expre&s;&s;ions. His
lofty Strains, neverthele&s;s tho' true, may not appear &s;o to them who
&s;tand at a Di&s;tance, and have no Ta&s;te there|of.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="17">To &s;peak freely of this Matter, I think
the&s;e Rules touching Retire|ment &s;hould be ob&s;erved.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> To have &s;uch a competent Fortune, as may
an&s;wer all the Cir|cum&s;tances of Life, when the Pro|fits of Employment are
quitted. For to be pinched in the Materials of Life, in old Age, is a
mi&s;erable State, e&s;pecially to a generous Mind.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> To have the Mind fur|ni&s;hed with &s;uch
Knowledge, while the Life was active, as may &s;uffici|ently employ it, when
contemplative.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> To have ones Pa&s;&s;ions de|tached from the
World, and to have little or no Thir&s;t after it.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> To con&s;ecrate the latter Part of Life to the
more inten&s;e Ser|vice of God, in Contemplation and Devotion, and in
Benefactions to the Nece&s;&s;itous; and to endeavour to produce &s;ome Fruit,
for the good of the Publick, for the pre&s;ent and fu|ture Age.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="18">More particularly; I think that a Retirement
to a convenient Hou&s;e and plea&s;ant Gardens, near a Church, where daily
Devotions may be had; a good Library, a near Friend, and the Exerci&s;e of
Philo&s;ophical Experi|ments, with Beneficence to the Nee|dy, is the &s;afe&s;t
and be&s;t Retirement for a wi&s;e Man. The&s;e Things will fill up the Space
of Life, with Inno|cence and Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">III. Of St. <HI>Mary Mag|dalen</HI>'s Life and
Con|ver&s;ion, with &s;ome Reflections on the Con|ver&s;ion of the good
Thief.</NOTE>As for the E&s;&s;ay of <HI>Mary Magda|len</HI>'s Life and
Conver&s;ion, and of the Conver&s;ion of the penitent Thief, he has made many
curious Ob&s;ervations thereon, with very u&s;eful Reflections. In the Author's
Di&s;cour&s;e on this Subject, he hath rather play'd the Prelate, than the
Gentleman, and having read the Fa|thers hereon, has been a little taint|ed with
their Gingle.</P>
<P>He has drawn it out to a Length, with &s;o &s;trong a Fancy and
Inventi|on, that one would rather have thought <PB N="xii" REF="19"> to have
been a Man of Thirty than Ninety, when he wrote it. In the winding up however
of that E&s;&s;ay, his Exhortations to the Love of our Sa|viour, and Contempt
of the World, have great Force and Energy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">IV. E&s;&s;ay of the Life and Con|ver&s;ion of
St. <HI>Paul.</HI></NOTE>It's a hard Matter for a Man that writes on a Divine
Subject, and who con&s;ults what the Fathers have &s;aid thereon, not to run
into their Stile, and conform to their way of Ex|pre&s;&s;ion. And thus the
Author has done in this, as well as in the pre|ceding E&s;&s;ay; yet his
Remarks on the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Cu&s;toms, of the Manner of their Education of
their Youth, what <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;ays of the &s;ower Di|&s;po&s;ition of
the <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> of which Sect <HI>Paul</HI> was a Member, of his
wonder|ful Conver&s;ion and indefatigable La|bour in the Mini&s;try, are worthy
of Ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>The Truth is, the wonderful E|vent of &s;preading the Go&s;pel, by
Means &s;o very improbable, and in <PB N="xiii" REF="20"> humane Appearance
&s;o unlikely, doth manife&s;tly &s;hew the Hand of God a&s;&s;i&s;ted
therein.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">V. E&s;&s;ay of Nobility.</NOTE>He has truly
di&s;tingui&s;h'd Nobi|lity into four Parts. The Beginner, Advancer, Continuer,
and Ruiner of Families; and has &s;et forth the Duty of a Nobleman, and the
Grace|fulne&s;s of it, when joined to Virtue, in a very agreeable Manner. The
gaining Honour by Military Perfor|mances, he holds much preferable to what is
obtain'd by Commerce; when the Soldier and the Scholar meet together, they make
a great General; witne&s;s <HI>Zenophon</HI> and <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> among&s;t
the Ancients, and Sir <HI>Wal|ter Raleigh</HI> and General <HI>Stanhope,</HI>
now Secretary of State, among&s;t the Modern. Yet I cannot but &s;ay, that when
that late War between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France</HI> &s;hall be writ by a
good Hand, the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> will &s;hine as bright in our
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Annals, as any General either ancient or mo|dern.</P>
<P><PB N="xiv" REF="21">The <HI>Scotch</HI> have a good Proverb,
<HI>That an Ounce of Mother's Wit, is better than a Pound of Clergy.</HI> By
Clergy they mean Learning.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">VI. E&s;&s;ay of Content|ment.</NOTE>His
E&s;&s;ay of Contentment under adver&s;e Fortune, and the many no|ble Examples
he brings of great Men in Adver&s;ity, and the weighty Rea&s;ons he gives for a
quiet Submi&s;&s;ion to the divine Providence in Afflicti|on, are &s;o genuine
and natural, that one may ea&s;ily &s;ee they flow from a Mind exerci&s;ed by
long Trial in that Condition. The afflicted of any &s;ort, may here draw Waters
of Con&s;olati|on, to give Peace and Re&s;t to their Minds.</P>
<P>His Arguments for Contentment under Afflictions, are very apt to
&s;often the Pa&s;&s;ions, and allay the Fury which Men generally exerci&s;e
under that State, and reduce the Mind to a wi&s;e and &s;ober Re&s;igna|tion to
the Will of God. He has writ in none of his E&s;&s;ays any thing 
<PB N="xv" REF="22"> above the Nature of a brave and a good Man, and
particularly on this Subject; he &s;eems rather to have vented the Dictates of
his own Mind, under the various States of Life, through which he had pa&s;s'd,
than offer at Conjectures which he never felt. He that &s;ets a Pattern above
humane Life, may plea&s;e the Fancy, but will never &s;atisfie the Judgment of
the Reader. In giving Rules for the Conduct of humane Life, in the various
Events of it, we &s;hould rather write like Divines and Philo|&s;ophers than
Poets. His Definition of Good and Evil, is more in&s;tru|ctive than that of
<HI>Zeno,</HI> or any of the Stoicks; for he calls that Good which makes a Man
the better, and that Evil which makes one the wor&s;e, be that Condition rich
or poor, great or low, ea&s;ie or painful.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">VII. E&s;&s;ay of Women.</NOTE>His
De&s;cription of Ladies, &s;hews his Ob&s;ervations of them to be very
accurate; they are beholden to him; <PB N="xvi" REF="23"> for he has &s;aid
very few things of them. I would give them this Cau|tion, not to be too free
with young Gentlemen, for they who will in|dulge to the extream Bounds of
Vir|tue, will ea&s;ily &s;lip within the Pale of Vice. So thin a Partition,
&s;o ea&s;ie a Tran&s;ition there is, between the one and the other. The Flie
that buzzes about the Candle often, ge|nerally has her Wings burnt at la&s;t.
The Per&s;on that would avoid burn|ing of Shins, mu&s;t &s;it at &s;ome
Di|&s;tance from the Fire. When Nature is rai&s;ed by Fooleries, Virtue &s;lips
out of the Room.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">VIII. E&s;&s;ay a&s; the Know|ledge of God, and
again&s;t Athei&s;m.</NOTE>His De&s;cription of the Vanity of Arts and
Sciences, without the Know|ledge of God, is a Truth &s;elf-evident: For all the
Knowledge of this World is calculated only for the Meridian of this Life, and
reaches no farther; but the Knowledge of God reaches to Eternity. And as
Travellers re|turning to their own Country, give <PB N="xvii" REF="24"> a
plea&s;ant Relation of things curious, which they have met with in Foreign
Parts; &s;o the Knowledge we acquire, and Ob&s;ervations we make of God's moral
Government of this World, of the Revolution of States and King|doms, and of the
natural Production of his admirable Works, may &s;erve us to entertain even
Angels in the Kingdom of Heaven. For tho' An|gels excel us in Wi&s;dom, Power,
and the Knowledge of &s;ome things; yet their Wi&s;dom, Power and Know|ledge
are circum&s;cribed; for none of the&s;e Qualities are infinite but in God;
they are ignorant of &s;ome Things: Omni&s;cience is the Attribute only of the
mo&s;t High: The Re|demption of Man in its full Latitude, they did not know.
Holy Writ tells us, that Angels were de&s;irous to look into it, and that they
were inform'd of it by the Church. But be that o|therwi&s;e; By the Study and
Know|ledge of the divine Operations, of God's natural Government of the 
<PB N="xviii" REF="25"> World, we arrive at the Knowledge of God him&s;elf; for
his Maje&s;ty is known by his Works, the Contem|plation of which brings
infinite Plea|&s;ure to them who delight therein.</P>
<P>As for Athei&s;m, holy Writ tells us, 'twas the Fool <HI>that
&s;aid in his Heart there was no God.</HI> And indeed no|thing but a Fool could
have thought or &s;aid &s;o, and he had only the Fol|ly of &s;aying it in his
Heart, but not the Impudence to expre&s;s in it Words: Surely as he that &s;ees
a fine Hou&s;e, mu&s;t conclude an ingenious Arti&s;t contrived it, and &s;ome
Per&s;on mu&s;t build it; for that Stones and Tim|ber cannot erect them&s;elves
into a regular Building, without &s;ome skil|ful Builder; &s;o he that looks on
the Frame of this World, mu&s;t acknow|ledge an infinite wi&s;e God, that made
and governs it: The Belief of which, to a virtuous Man, is a mighty Sup|port in
the Day of Trouble.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">IX. E&s;&s;ay of Religion.</NOTE>He has &s;et
in a true Light, the Ad|vantages of Religion, to Communi|ties 
<PB N="xix" REF="26"> in general, and to private Per|&s;ons in particular,
&s;ufficient to recom|mend it to the Practice of the World. His Complaint of
the Ig|norance of Chri&s;tians, with re&s;pect to their Religion, and that they
take up their Religion as they do the Fa|&s;hion of their Cloaths, according to
the Cu&s;tom of the Country where they live, hath been true, 'till of late
Years, even in this Reform'd Coun|try; but the Charity Schools that have been

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">XIII. E&s;&s;ay of Children.</NOTE>We take a

Children from crying by Stories of Hob-Goblins, Spirits, and &s;uch Fooleries,
have made them, when of an adult Age, afraid of being in the Dark, and of
&s;omething, they know not what. They teach them Pride, and to value
them&s;elves upon their Cloaths, by asking and &s;hewing them where they are
fine, which Folly accompanies the Female Sex u&s;ually to their Grave; nor are
foppi&s;h Men free from that Vanity.</P>
<P>They teach them Revenge and Folly at the &s;ame time, by
pretending to beat another by a Blow or Pat from the Hand of the Child.</P>
<P>They teach them lying and Folly, by telling Mi&s;s, 'twas not
&s;he that cry'd, but one behind the Curtain. Thus taught, comes the abu&s;ed
Infant on the Stage of the World; whereas the mo&s;t di|&s;creet 
<PB N="xxix" REF="36"> and prudent People &s;hould be at|tendant on Children,
to make proper Impre&s;&s;ions upon them at fir&s;t, for the&s;e &s;tick

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">XIV. E&s;&s;ay of Law.</NOTE>The Benefit of
Laws and living by Rules, are &s;o evident to every Under|&s;tanding, that
there needs but little to be &s;aid in Commendation thereof.</P>
<P>There is &s;carce any Nation under Heaven, however de&s;potick and
ab&s;o|lute the Prince is, but yet has &s;ome cer|tain Rule or Law for the
general Con|duct of humane Life, with re&s;pect to the Publick; yet when the
Prince is ab&s;olute, the Subject is little better than a Slave, Law being but
a Cobweb to him, which he can ea&s;ily break thro', when-ever he plea&s;es.
That the People conform their Lives after the Example of the Prince, and chief
Magi&s;trate where they re&s;ide, the Author hath ve|ry ju&s;tly ob&s;erved,
which ought to be a Le&s;&s;on to all Princes and Magi&s;trates, to act with
great Caution, that their bad <PB N="xxx" REF="37"> Example may not lead the
common People, or tho&s;e of a common Under|&s;tanding, into Vices. <HI>Regis
ad exemplum totus componitur Orbis.</HI> And here I can|not but &s;ay a Word of
the Benefit of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Laws, which both Foreigners that live
here, and Natives, have great Rea&s;on to be thankful to Providence for. The
Laws of <HI>England</HI> &s;ecure every Man's Property and Liberty, no Man
forfeits either, but by the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of &s;ome known po&s;itive Law.
The Magi&s;trate cannot commit any Sub|ject to Pri&s;on, without a Breach of
the Laws; if he does, he is an&s;werable for it to the Party injured. The Judge
de|termines not according to Arbitrary Power, but according to known and
&s;tated Rules. But this Subject hath been &s;o much &s;poken of, that I think
it not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay any more thereon.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">XV. E&s;&s;ay of old Age.</NOTE>As no Man
writes more feelingly of Afflictions, than he who gives his Thoughts a Vent
under that Conditi|on; &s;o no Man can write &s;o truly of the Circum&s;tances
of old Age, as he <PB N="xxxi" REF="38"> that keeps his Under&s;tanding well to
an hundred, the which the Author did, as appears by his E&s;&s;ays, &s;ome of
which were writ at near that Age.</P>
<P>The Re&s;pect he challenges, as due to old Age e&s;pecially, when
furni&s;h'd with Wi&s;dom and Knowledge; and the Con&s;ideration of good
Services done to the Publick, is a Tribute, that I think ought not to be deny'd
it. But nothing can make the Mind of an old Man more calm and &s;edate, more
bright and &s;hining, than a Retro&s;pect of a long Life well &s;pent, in a
zealous promoting the Honour of God, and the Good and Welfare of Mankind; for
every Man's Life is to be e&s;timated by its U&s;efulne&s;s. Integrity of Mind,
a love of Truth in the Soul, and the Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of do|ing all we can,
for our mo&s;t munificent Benefactor, to whom we are riding po&s;t in old Age,
makes that Scene of Life full of Joy and Plea&s;ure. St. <HI>Paul</HI> was full
of Rapture, when he was going off the Stage of Life, tho' by a violent Death.
But few Courtiers come within <PB N="xxxii" REF="39"> this Character; for to
them generally Fal&s;hood and Deceit are as natural, as bowing and cringing;
and as for Truth, it hath no Place in their Souls. They join them&s;elves to a
Party, that they may mount up to be the Head of it, with no other View, but to
betray and de&s;troy it, and to aggrandize them&s;elves thereby. Oh!
ble&s;&s;ed Sincerity, oh hap|py Integrity! But this wicked State of Life is as
ancient as <HI>Seneca</HI> the Trage|dian, witne&s;s the&s;e Lines,

<HEAD>Of Company and Conver&s;ation.</HEAD>
<P>_WHEN God created <HI>Adam,</HI> who the fir&s;t Moment was a
perfect Man, yet he was not made to be entirely de|tached, and to live
inde|pendant of his Kind; for tho' he had nothing in Pro&s;pect but Plenty,
Plea&s;ure, Innocence, and Secu|rity, and by the Dignity of his Nature was
&s;et above the Society of meer Ani|mals, yet God &s;aw his Being imperfect
without a Helper, and that his Happi|ne&s;s <PB N="2" REF="41"> was not
compleat whil&s;t he remain'd Solitary; wherefore God miraculou&s;ly reliev'd
him, by dividing him, to unite him, and made one Part of him a Com|panion for
the other, to maintain his Rea&s;on with a more equal Conver&s;e; for which End
God ordain'd Speech, from whence we derive all the Advan|tages of Society, and
without which Men would have been u&s;ele&s;s to each other. For by this we
po&s;&s;e&s;s the mo&s;t valuable worldly Ble&s;&s;ings, Friend&s;hip and
Society, which are e&s;teem'd among&s;t the Plea&s;ures of the fir&s;t
Magnitude, the Comfort of Life depending upon Con|ver&s;ation, Humane Society
being like the working of a Arch-Stone, where all would fall to the Ground if
one Peice did not &s;u&s;tain another; and yet Com|pany is &s;o dangerous, and
Speech &s;o lia|ble to be deprav'd, that what was inten|ded for our Advantage
is become the Source of all our Misfortunes. For Ori|ginal Sin came fir&s;t out
of the Mouth by Speaking, before it entred hers by Eat|ing, and therefore the
due Management of that Member may ju&s;tly be reputed one of the greate&s;t
My&s;teries of Wi&s;dom and Virtue, &s;ince we find to our Sorrow, the fir&s;t
U&s;e <HI>Eve</HI> made of her Tongue was to talk with the Tempter, and from 
<PB N="3" REF="42"> that Di&s;cour&s;e to tempt <HI>Adam,</HI> who was no
&s;ooner fallen, but he makes a frivo|lous Excu&s;e le&s;s able to cover his
Sin than the Fig-Leaves his Nakedne&s;s; And this Viciou&s;ne&s;s of the Tongue
hath de|&s;cended from the Infancy of the World even to this Day, for among&s;t
our great|e&s;t Depravations there are none more Notorious than that of Speech;
For we do not only fall by the Slipperine&s;s of our Tongues, but we
deliberately train them to Mi&s;chief, and what was fir&s;t intended for the
Benefit of Humane Society, is now become the great Di&s;turber of it, we living
in an Age wherein we count it a part of our Birth-right to let loo&s;e our
Tongues, and to u&s;e the Spur where we &s;hould hold the Bridle; whereby
Conver&s;ation is generally Corrupted, and he that Conver&s;es has almo&s;t as
ma|ny Snares as Companions, there being &s;carce any &s;ingle Man, but by his
Di&s;|cour&s;e, Example, or Behaviour, does recommend to us, or imprint in us,
or by a kind of Contagion in&s;en&s;ibly infect us with &s;ome Vice or other;
&s;o that Conver&s;ation, which was intended to cultivate our Minds and
civilize the World, hath turn'd it almo&s;t to a Wil|derne&s;s. Upon this
Account &s;ome Men will take a Pett at Mankind, and walk <PB N="4" REF="43">
into the De&s;arts to avoid Company, when it is more prudential to &s;tand
their Ground, and to fence again&s;t the In|conveniencies that may happen; and
if they fear bad Company they &s;hould keep clo&s;e to Men of Virtue, and
&s;tand care|fully upon their Guard; it being more rea&s;onable to be
conver&s;able for the &s;ake of the Good, than to fly from every Mortal for
fear of meeting with bad People: If every Man were po&s;&s;e&s;t with this
Shine&s;s, not only States and King|doms, but even Humane Nature would be
de&s;troy'd; for to what end was Speech given to Man, if it were not for
Enter|tainment of each other? And mu&s;t we quit our Station, and turn Savage
by our &s;elves, and &s;uffer no Company, for fear of Bad? This is to take
Things by the wrong Handle, for nothing but our own Mi&s;carriages ought to
affect us, and not tho&s;e of other People.</P>
<P>'Tis certain that all Mens Bodies are naturally of the &s;ame Clay,
the difference of Education only is the Pot|ter's Hand that forms them into
Ve&s;|&s;els of Honour or Di&s;honour; there being no humane Means more
effectual towards ripening and &s;harpning Mens Intellects, giving them an edge
and quickne&s;s for Conver&s;ation, than good <PB N="5" REF="44"> Education,
becau&s;e it takes them in that Age wherein their Faculties are, as their
Joints, pliable and tractable, and &s;o capable of being by Exerci&s;e
impro|ved into great Degrees of Strength, Activity and Ability: So that one of
the greate&s;t Ble&s;&s;ings which Man can receive at God's Hands, is the
favoura|ble Ble&s;&s;ing of good Education, which poli&s;hes and purifies
Nature as one would do a precious Stone wholly defiled with Earth; and this
makes Men become like Angels, when without it the be&s;t Na|tures would &s;till
dwell in Bruti&s;hne&s;s. Now &s;ince after good Education, it is a great Part
of Wi&s;dom as well as Breed|ing, to learn what is convenient, and to take the
true height of our Acquain|tance, who conver&s;ing with our Minds, ca&s;t upon
them either Graces or Defor|mities; It will therefore be highly ne|ce&s;&s;ary
for young Gentlemen, who are tender of their Honour and Credit, to be more than
ordinarily careful of being too venturous of any Company, and to be very
curious in taking an exact Survey with what Per&s;ons they may &s;afely and
decently Conver&s;e, and how they ought to Behave them&s;elves therein.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="45">It is u&s;ual with Phy&s;icians, in infectious
Times, to forbid mo&s;t &s;trictly the &s;mal|ler Exce&s;&s;es and Exorbitances
of Diet, as apt to breed any Di&s;temper, becau&s;e every &s;mall Accident of
that Kind (thro' the Malignity of the Air) is then likely to turn into the
Plague: So now that Athei&s;m and Profanene&s;s are rife in the World, and
&s;pread much, and Debau|chery is &s;o predominant and contagious, that we
daily &s;ee many Men of virtuous Di&s;po&s;itions and good Inclinations, (which
would have grown to Abilities) to be by ill Company mo&s;t perniciou&s;ly
Corrupted; &s;ome Cautions herein &s;eem therefore highly nece&s;&s;ary: For as
if we Breath in an infectious Air we &s;hall &s;uck in Di&s;ea&s;es, &s;o if we
live in bad Company we &s;hall &s;oon add to their Number, and learn their
Vices and Im|perfections.</P>
<P>There is nothing more dangerous for young Gentlemen than to
mi&s;take them|&s;elves in the Choice of their Company: This is a Point of
&s;uch Importance, that upon it depends the whole Cour&s;e of their Lives and
Manners; the frequen|ting with wicked Men brings us acquain|ted with Vice,
makes us behold it with|out Emotion, by Degrees we begin to act it with &s;ome
Plea&s;ure, and Time breeds in us a Habit.</P>

appear upon this Stage till he knows how to Act his Part to the Life; and
therefore he mu&s;t labour to have his Mind made pliable, which may &s;toop and
ri&s;e according to the &s;everal Con|ditions and Capacities of Men he
a&s;&s;o|ciates with, not fearing to &s;peak to the Greate&s;t with due
Ob&s;ervance, nor di&s;|daining to conver&s;e familiarly with the Meane&s;t,
re&s;pecting Goodne&s;s where|ever he &s;ees it, which he &s;hall as often find
under a Ru&s;&s;et Coat as under a <PB N="8" REF="47"> Velvet Ca&s;&s;ock, and
with Moral hone&s;t Men as &s;oon as with the more Learned; for Conver&s;ation
hath made very accom|pli&s;h'd Per&s;ons without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of
Learning, the World being a great Book which in&s;tructs continually,
Conver&s;a|tions are living Libraries, not at all in|ferior to Books; Good
Conferences are like Flints, which from a cold and dark Heap produce Heat and
Light, if Men &s;trike them one again&s;t the other; and the familiar
Di&s;cour&s;es of two or three good Wits may be more advan|tageous to us than
the empty Di&s;pu|tations of many Pedants together, and they vent more in one
Hour than we &s;hall read all Day in a Library.</P>
<P>There is nothing that puts better Thoughts in a Man than a good
Com|panion; for Example hath the force of Precept, and touches the Heart with
an Affection to Goodne&s;s; and not only the frequent hearing, but the very
&s;eeing of a Wi&s;e Man delights us.</P>
<P>The be&s;t Rule herein is to a&s;&s;ociate with tho&s;e who may be
the better for us, and we for them; the&s;e Re&s;pects are mutual; for while we
teach we learn: It is not Safe to tru&s;t our &s;elves with much Company;
who&s;oever goes much abroad, he &s;carce comes home the same 
<PB N="9" REF="48"> Man he went out, &s;omething or other di&s;compo&s;es him;
for it is with our Minds, as it is after a long Indi&s;po&s;ition with our
Bodies, we are grown &s;o ten|der that the lea&s;t Breath of Air expo&s;es us
to a Relap&s;e.</P>
<P>There is certainly much Plea&s;ure and Satisfaction in communicating
our Thoughts, and in the Intercour&s;es of Friend&s;hip well cho&s;en; and
therefore <HI>Seneca</HI> &s;aid, <HI>If Knowledge and Wi&s;dom were offered
him, on the Terms of a Se|cret, and that he mu&s;t not &s;peak of it, he would
po&s;itively refu&s;e the Pre&s;ent.</HI> And <HI>Tully</HI> in his
<HI>Offices</HI> tells us, <HI>If a Per&s;on had all the Ble&s;&s;ings of this
Life, yet if he was kept from all Company, and ne|ver to &s;ee or conver&s;e
with Men, he had much rather Die, than Live in &s;uch Con|dition.</HI></P>
<P>Now the fir&s;t Step to Conver&s;ation is our outward Carriage and
Comport|ment, wherein the le&s;s we are con&s;train'd, our Actions and Thoughts
&s;eem there|by more Innocent: The Differences of Men are ea&s;ily read in
their Behaviour, and a &s;hort Ob&s;ervation of that will often tell us as much
as a long Confe|rence. Some Mens Carriage is like a Ver&s;e, where every
Syllable is mea&s;ur'd; but where there is &s;o much Care about the 
<PB N="10" REF="49"> Out&s;ide, there is commonly a Remi&s;ne&s;s in what
belongs to the Mind; it being as rare to &s;ee &s;tarched complimental Man
Wi&s;e, as to &s;ee a Woman Valiant. There is a &s;ort of Men who have an
earne&s;t Application to make every thing &s;it right about them, which
&s;trikes too deep into their &s;mall Stock of Thoughts to allow it Furniture
for any thing el&s;e, and therefore to do right to the&s;e fine|&s;pun
Gentlemen, Conver&s;ation is too cour&s;e a Thing for them, and it's be&s;t to
leave them to their Taylor, with whom they will live in better
Cor|re&s;pondence than with any other Com|pany. Indeed, a good Pre&s;ence and
hand&s;ome Mein, &s;orted with Valour and Wi&s;dom, does a Man excellent
Service, (if he &s;poils it not with Affe|ctation) and carries with it (as
Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> us'd to &s;ay) <HI>Letters or Re|commendation</HI>;
and if I am rightly in|form'd, this was the only Thing that brought the great
Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> into Favour with King <HI>James</HI> I. by
&s;ee|ing him at a Ma&s;que in Court. Cer|tainly, if our outward Comportment be
good, the adorning the Mind does dou|ble that Excellency; if ill, it will make
it good, when the Mind performs what the Body promi&s;es not. Our Behaviour 
<PB N="11" REF="50"> &s;hould be like a well-made Suit of Cloaths, more proper
than gaudy, more fit than fine. In our outward Carriage, all manner of
Affectation is un&s;eemly, there being nothing more becoming a Gentleman than a
native Freedom there|in, a Gracefulne&s;s of Behaviour &s;etting off much when
it is not con&s;train'd. Dancing is good, and adds Grace to a Man, when he well
performs it; but a Man mu&s;t not &s;et him&s;elf to it as if he made it his
Trade. Dancing makes the Body free, and not &s;o &s;tiff but to move
gracefully; and a Man's Skill is therein perceiv'd tho' he &s;tands &s;till:
But who|ever intends to make it his Ma&s;ter-peice, one may call it excelling
in a Mi&s;take, which is <HI>no good Commendation,</HI> as a late great Lord
&s;aid. It is a great Advan|tage to be a good Actor; for Action is a kind of
Expre&s;&s;ion, and Words well cho&s;en are agreeable, when they expre&s;s
Things that plea&s;e; &s;o all that is ex|pre&s;&s;ed by the Face and Body is
well re|ceiv'd when done with a good Grace. But we mu&s;t not here mi&s;take:
For there are tho&s;e that are &s;ometimes Actors of Nothing, as well as
tho&s;e that are Speakers of Nothing: The Action and Air of the Countenance
have certain Charms, which have a great Influence <PB N="12" REF="51"> on our
Minds: An Oration &s;poken by a good Orator appears great and lofty, tho'
penn'd in common Terms, and compounded of ordinary Conceptions; and many
Preachers have in their Pul|pits charm'd their Auditors, who&s;e Ser|mons in
Print were &s;carce worth Read|ing: I have heard Ver&s;es recited in a good
Tone, which have been admir'd, which being read by another, their E&s;teem was
much dimini&s;h'd; and it's probable the Rea&s;on of this Alteration proceeded
from the Harmony which was then wanting: We &s;hould not look upon this as
&s;trange of good Orations, and agreeable Conferences, if we call to mind that
of Mu&s;ical In&s;truments, touch|ed by the Hands of an exqui&s;ite Ma&s;ter;
there are &s;ome Tones which in&s;pire Sad|ne&s;s, and &s;weetly incline our
Souls to Langui&s;h; and there are Airs which Re|joyce and make our Hearts
Merry, and plea&s;ingly compel our Feet to Dance their Time.</P>
<P>In Conver&s;ation, it is not enough to have Wit, but he mu&s;t be an
extream well-bred Man to know how to be plea|&s;ant in Conver&s;ation,
among&s;t Per&s;ons that know how to Judge; becau&s;e mo&s;t Men have not a
delicate Ta&s;te, nor are able to di&s;cern what is be&s;t; and it often 
<PB N="13" REF="52"> happens that &s;uch Per&s;ons are taken, nay even charm'd
with certain ridiculous Parts they play to them; but tho' the&s;e Fooleries are
current among&s;t &s;ome, yet well-bred Per&s;ons do not love &s;uch kind of
Buffoonry, and tho&s;e that u&s;e them are rather the Subjects of Scorn than
Laugh|ter, to tho&s;e that rightly under&s;tand: Such are half-witted Men, who
have a tin&s;el Wit, which &s;hines among&s;t tho&s;e who cannot Judge, Petty
Merchants of &s;mall Conceits, who have an empty Ha|bit of Prating without
Meaning, they always aim at Wit, but generally make fal&s;e Fire</P>
<P>'Tis true, we cannot &s;hew too much Wit in plea&s;ant
Conver&s;ation; yet a Man mu&s;t have a great Care not to &s;hew him&s;elf too
forward, as if one would appear ready to make Je&s;ts and &s;peak fine Things:
There is &s;omething of a free way, which cannot be well expre&s;&s;ed, which
hath a much better Effect; but yet it is not good to be too Re&s;erv'd, nor
affect Singularity; an open and com|plai&s;ant Carriage hath very great Charms
to attract Love: However, what Ad|vantage &s;oever any one hath, he mu&s;t be
pleas'd with others, if he would have others pleas'd with him: And if we like
not our Company, let us withdraw from <PB N="14" REF="53"> them; but whil&s;t
we are in Company, we &s;hould carry our &s;elves &s;o, that we &s;hould be
acceptable to tho&s;e with whom we Conver&s;e, tho' we have no Kindne&s;s for
them. As for tho&s;e who think to Revenge them&s;elves by a cro&s;s Carriage,
they do them&s;elves more Injury than they do to others. The Love of Socie|ty
is Natural, but the Choice of our Company is Matter of Prudence, and the
Con&s;cience of giving good Example is one of the greate&s;t Obligations any
Man can lay upon the Age he lives in.</P>
<P>It is indeed a fair Step towards Hap|pine&s;s and Virtue, to delight
in the Conver&s;ation of good and wi&s;e Men, and where tho&s;e cannot be had,
it is be&s;t to keep no Company at all. When Men are Good and Virtuous, they
are as good alone as in Company, but mo&s;t Men are of them&s;elves the wor&s;t
Com|pany they can keep; let &s;uch therefore Conver&s;e with others, and avoid
them|&s;elves; but he that cannot &s;ecure him|&s;elf in Privacy, &s;hall be
much more ex|pos'd in Publick. Many a Ship is lo&s;t in the Harbour, but more
in the Ocean. There are &s;ome Per&s;ons who&s;e Compa|ny we cannot too much
frequent; 'tis certain, by &s;eeing them often, be&s;ides the Improvement we
have by being with <PB N="15" REF="54"> them, we gain a good E&s;teem to our
&s;elves, as we Perfume our &s;elves un|awares by walking among&s;t the
Je&s;&s;amins and Orange Trees. Witty Men, who are well-bred, always &s;ay
&s;omething that plea&s;es, and &s;eldom do any thing which hath not &s;ome
Mark of Worth and Breeding; and by conver&s;ing with and ob&s;erving them, we
may not only in|form our &s;elves of &s;uch Things as are nece&s;&s;ary to be
known for the making an accompli&s;h'd Man, but we al&s;o learn how to apply
them, and likewi&s;e &s;o far as to know when 'tis proper and man|nerly to be
Silent: But we mu&s;t know how to di&s;tingui&s;h, for we &s;hall often hear
very good Things come from Men, who behave them&s;elves with as much
Becomingne&s;s as can be di&s;ired; yet many times this is but borrow'd
Lan|guage, and the Actings of a Part, and therefore we mu&s;t not regard &s;o
much that which appears Polite and Regular, as we do certain other Things,
which &s;hew whether there be a Foundation, and that the Under&s;tanding goes
farther, and is of larger Extent.</P>
<P>We find in &s;ome Men a certain Plau|&s;iblene&s;s of Carriage,
which plea&s;es in young People, but yet pa&s;&s;es away like a Flower or a
Dream, and we &s;hall often <PB N="16" REF="55"> &s;ee the&s;e Men become the
Neglect and Scorn of tho&s;e who once admir'd them; but a well-bred Man hath
more &s;olid Virtues, tho' he be le&s;s bu&s;ie and for|ward to &s;hew
him&s;elf in the World; and if we love a Man for his good Breeding and
Hone&s;ty we &s;hall always love him. Yet it is not enough to have a fair
Out|&s;ide to make a Man agreeable; that which is of greate&s;t Importance, is
the Will regulating our Intellectuals, and taking Care that our Head and our
Heart be in good Order; for no Man can ever be Excellent without having a good
Heart and much Wit.</P>
<P>An accompli&s;h'd Per&s;on, tho' of ne|ver &s;o much Wit, ought not
to be too Confident of him&s;elf; for the more he Excels, the more Care he
ought to take not to Pre&s;cribe to the Company; for naturally every Man is
afraid of a Ma&s;ter Wit, and Men do not love to be he|ctor'd out of their
Opinions, it being e&s;teem'd the common Birth-right of Mankind, that every Man
to opine and judge according to the Dictates of his own Under&s;tanding, and
not of another's; and therefore a Magi&s;terialne&s;s in Opi|nion is very
unbefitting Men in Conver|&s;ation, for it does not only fa&s;ten upon our
Nature, but upon the better Part of <PB N="17" REF="56"> it, our Rea&s;on:
Freedom is the endea|ring Thing in Society, and where that is controlled, Men
are not very fond of A&s;&s;ociating them&s;elves. 'Tis Natural for us to be
unea&s;ie in the Pre&s;ence of tho&s;e that a&s;&s;ume an Authority over us; as
Children care not for the Company of their Parents or Tutors that govern them.
And Men will care le&s;s for theirs, who would make them Children by u&s;urping
a Tutorage over them. This Perem|ptorine&s;s in Conver&s;ation renders Wi&s;e
Men di&s;obliging and very trouble&s;ome, and Fools ridiculous and
contemptible, we &s;eeing none &s;o peremptory as half|witted People, who have
ju&s;t enough to excite their Pride, but not &s;o much as to cure their
Ignorance: This is the Effect of a mean and imprudent Educa|tion; a Man who
hath conver&s;t only with the lower Sort of Company, who dur&s;t not di&s;pute
nor examine his A&s;&s;er|tions, thinks the &s;ame fal&s;e Coin will pa&s;s
over the World, which went cur|rant among&s;t his Petty Comerades; And we may
ob&s;erve this Fault is mo&s;t u&s;ual among&s;t young Men, who have come raw
into Company with good Fortunes and ill Breeding. And there|fore tho&s;e
Per&s;ons are mo&s;t to be e&s;teem|ed, who &s;hew their Wit without offen|ding
<PB N="18" REF="57"> any one; and &s;uch are u&s;ually ha|ted, who make u&s;e
of Wit only to the di&s;plea&s;ing of others; and a Wi&s;e Man ought to avoid
the Company of &s;uch, it being a &s;mall Advantage to have Wit, if we do not
make u&s;e of it for gaining the good Opinion and Love of the World. We ought
to deal with others, with that Patience, Re&s;pect, and Mo|deration, which we
expect from them, not &s;etting forth our own Opinions im|periou&s;ly, nor
rejecting the Opinion of others arrogantly, remembring that we are all
enwrapped in a deep Mi&s;t, and that all our Rea&s;oning is but groping in the
Dark; and therefore we &s;hould pa&s;s gently over the Errors of our
Neigh|bours, to oblige them to the like Ac|count: But many Gentlemen are &s;o
far from this generous Humour, that they always behave them&s;elves
di&s;dainfully in Company, as if they could not &s;et a ju&s;t Value upon
them&s;elves without the ut|ju&s;t Contempt of others. But this Pride is
commonly a Wind that blows only one Way, down Hill upon tho&s;e below him,
upwards they breath gentler Gales, it being one of their mo&s;t &s;tudied
Fa|culties, to perform all Acts of the high|e&s;t &s;uper-errogating Civility
to tho&s;e above them; Now there is nothing that <PB N="19" REF="58"> makes a
Man more di&s;ta&s;teful to Com|pany, than this haughty Humour, it being not
only Pride but Inhumanity, to attribute &s;o much to the Prerogative of Birth,
as not to &s;hew Affability and Re&s;pect to the Meane&s;t.</P>
<P>The Conver&s;ation of tho&s;e who are bred in Armies is not commonly
very plea&s;ing, but in Recompence, they are &s;aid to be Men of Honour and
Repu|tation, as if that would excu&s;e their Wants in every Thing el&s;e, when
there is nothing &s;o di&s;gu&s;ting as to be di&s;|agreeable and moro&s;e in
Company. This is like certain Women, that pretend to Virtue, who value
them&s;elves much up|on their being Coy and Fierce, which makes Men think all
is counterfeit and affected, and that they are ea&s;ier gotten, than tho&s;e
who ob&s;erve good Manners and Breeding, and are as Affable as the&s;e are
Severe. Such Women are like tho&s;e peevi&s;h Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, who think they
have a Licence to Kick and Scratch, provided they do not Ki&s;s, as if Ladies
could not be hone&s;t without being rude. A con|fident yet a mode&s;t Carriage,
which is neither mean nor &s;ullen, having nothing which &s;avours not of
Goodne&s;s and Ho|ne&s;ty, is that which is mo&s;t e&s;teem'd in the World, and
takes with every Body: <PB N="20" REF="59"> Women who have mo&s;t Wit, like
be&s;t a di&s;creet Re&s;ervedne&s;s in Men, tho&s;e being u&s;ually
di&s;appointed of their Aims, who throw, as it were, their Hearts at Ladies
Heads, and at the fir&s;t Da&s;h tell them more of their Love, than can in any
probability be true, and many times more than they de&s;ire to hear.</P>
<P>In our Conver&s;ation, it is good Ad|vice to &s;pare and thriftily
to order that which a Man knows, and tho' he hath that in his Head which is
better than Silence, yet he ought to be more wil|ling to hear, than to &s;peak,
to learn, than to teach; it being a great Folly to be more ready to &s;hew all
that is in us, rather than to learn Knowledge of ano|ther, to &s;pend our own
Stock, rather than to get new. When we hear we receive, when we &s;peak we
give, and tho' it be more glorious to give, yet it is more profitable to
receive; and there|fore a ju&s;t Moderation herein is be&s;t, not to be
over-Silent nor Talkative, the fir&s;t &s;hewing Stupidity or Scorn, the la&s;t
Giddine&s;s of the Brain: Prudent Men will therefore &s;peak no more than to
bring on Di&s;cour&s;e, and will give others their turns of Speech; a Civil
Gue&s;t will no more Talk all, than Eat all the Fea&s;t. It is a great
Advantage to know <PB N="21" REF="60"> how to Speak and to Write; when either
&s;mells too much of Study it plea&s;es not; the general Opinion is, that Men
&s;hould Write as they Speak, and Speak as they Write; but we &s;eldom do
either, as we wi&s;h we could: In order to this, it were good when we Write to
imagine we are Speaking, that we may not put in any Thing that is not Natural,
or which may not be &s;poken in Company; and when we Speak, we &s;hould fancy
we are Writing, that we may not &s;ay any Thing that is not fitting: Many
People are &s;aid to Speak well who cannot Write well, but I doubt there is a
Mi&s;take herein, for &s;ome Men may &s;eem to Speak well in Appearance, when
they do not in Effect: For when a Man really excels in Speak|ing, he may do the
&s;ame in Writing; but this latter requires more Care, and one may Write well,
without knowing how to Speak well, for we u&s;ually &s;ee tho&s;e who make it
their Bu&s;ine&s;s to Write well, have commonly a langui&s;h|ing Way of
Speaking; for to Speak well, is not only to make our Thoughts be under&s;tood,
but to expre&s;s our Ap|prehen&s;ions, which are two very diffe|rent Things;
and there is no greater &s;ign that a Man well under&s;tands him|&s;elf, than
to be able per&s;picuou&s;ly to <PB N="22" REF="61"> Speak to the
Under&s;tanding of another; and our Di&s;cour&s;e &s;hould always be mea&s;ur'd
by the Aptne&s;s of it to whom it is Addre&s;&s;ed; for unle&s;s our Speech be
fitted to the Capacities of tho&s;e we Di&s;|cour&s;e with, tho' it be never
&s;o elabo|rate, it will rather Confound than Edi|fie.</P>
<P>Thus, the be&s;t Art of Speaking &s;hews it &s;elf under a natural
Dre&s;s; it is like plain natural Beauty, tho&s;e that are the mo&s;t Perfect
&s;hew them&s;elves lea&s;t, and when our Words &s;mell of Art and Study, one
may conclude, they that &s;ay them have but little of either, or el&s;e that
they know not how to make u&s;e of them. This is the Fault of tho&s;e that
Speak &s;o, that they cannot be under|&s;tood but by the Learned: We &s;hould
therefore to our Power rather mean Wi&s;ely, than &s;peak Learnedly, much
le&s;s Affectedly; for tho&s;e who&s;e Tongues run Proud after Words, are of
very lit|tle U&s;e, but among&s;t &s;uch Ears as call a Bag-Pipe Mu&s;ick, for
their Lips open like a Pur&s;e without Money, and their Tongues like a Fencer
before a Pageant, &s;tir, but not &s;trike. A Gentleman &s;hould talk like a
Gentleman, that is, like a Wi&s;e Man; his Knowledge ought to be general, he
&s;hould have a Ta&s;te of every <PB N="23" REF="62"> Thing, he &s;hould not be
a Slave to one Science, one Knowledge is but Part of the Hou&s;e, like a bay
Window, no Man will build his Hou&s;e &s;o maim'd, much le&s;s him&s;elf, he
mu&s;t be Com|pleat.</P>
<P>All tho&s;e who have given Rules for Civil Life, have, in order to
it, put very &s;evere Re&s;trictions upon the Tongue, that it run not before
the Judgment. 'Twas <HI>Zeno</HI>'s Advice to Dip the Tongue in the Mind before
one &s;hould Speak; and <HI>Theophra&s;tus</HI> was us'd to &s;ay, It was
&s;afer tru&s;ting to an unbridled Hor&s;e, than to intemperate Speech; and
daily Experience confirms this Aphori&s;m, for tho&s;e who &s;et no Guard upon
their Tongues are hurried by them into a thou&s;and Indecencies, and very often
into real con&s;iderable Mi&s;chiefs; and whereas Men &s;hould keep a Lock upon
their Lips, they give their Tongue the Key of their Heart, and the Event hath
been often as Unhappy, as the Proceeding was Prepo&s;terous.</P>
<P>And as our Words mu&s;t be the Pro|duct of our Judgment, &s;o they
mu&s;t be temperate and decent, mixed with Cur|te&s;ie and Civility; for he
that hath calm|ed his Pa&s;&s;ions, hath nothing to betray them to ra&s;h and
rude Language, which <PB N="24" REF="63"> is a Foam ca&s;t up only by the
Billows of a turbulent Mind, and can never be the I&s;&s;ues of a &s;erene
compo&s;ed Tem|per; neither does any thing Charm us more than gracious
Language, <HI>Quae ne illos quidem quos damnat offendit</HI>; a pregnant
Example of which was &s;een in the la&s;t Age, at the Tryal of the Earl of
<HI>Strafford,</HI> Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ire|land,</HI> in the Year 1642.
where, among&s;t others that were appointed by the Hou&s;e of Commons to Manage
their Impeach|ment again&s;t him, there was one emi|nent Lawyer, who urged very
&s;martly again&s;t his Lord&s;hip, but yet with great Re&s;pect and Civility
of Language; And when the Earl came to Reply, as he did to every one, he &s;aid
he had been very roughly handled by mo&s;t of the Plea|ders; but that he was
very much be|holding to one civil Gentleman among&s;t them, (naming the former
Per&s;on) who, tho' he had touched him nearer the Quick than any other, yet he
was ob|liged to return him Thanks, becau&s;e he had cut his Throat with a clean
Knife: Thus we &s;ee good Words are afforded at the &s;ame Price as ill, and
are not on|ly cheap, but prevalent upon all Occa|&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="64">Next to this Graciou&s;ne&s;s of Lan|guage, we
&s;hould be very careful that our Speeches carry Integrity with them, Candour
and Ingenuity being mo&s;t e|&s;teem'd in Di&s;cour&s;e: Tho&s;e who have
upright Hearts, their Judgment (how &s;mall &s;oever) will be &s;till the
&s;ame, but tho&s;e who have many Turnings and Doubles in their Heart, never
have a right Under&s;tanding, there is always &s;ome counterfeit Light, which
gives them fal&s;e Appearances, and then their Artifices and Craft &s;hew they
have not Parts &s;ufficient to effect their De&s;igns by fair and hone&s;t
Ways; whereas the way that plea&s;es worthy Per&s;ons, is that Freedom of
Plain-Dealing. What a Gracefulne&s;s &s;o clear a Source gives to all the
Actions of our Life? How it beautifies our Words and Thoughts? And how
plea&s;ing a Thing it is to Speak well, when &s;o much Sincerity goes a|long
with it? And tho' one may not perhaps be Happy in all Things by following this
Maxim; however, one is &s;ure at lea&s;t to gain the E&s;teem and Af|fection of
tho&s;e who under&s;tand true Merit, nothing being &s;o commendable in
Conver&s;ation as to have an upright and &s;incere Heart, which &s;eems to be
the Foundation of Wi&s;dom.</P>

Interpreter of the Soul: It is <HI>anime index &amp; &s;peculum,</HI> the
Me&s;&s;en|ger of the Heart, the Gate by which all that is within i&s;&s;ues
forth, and comes into open Veiw: And therefore the Philo&s;opher &s;aid well to
the Child, <HI>Lo|quere ut te videam,</HI> Speak that I may &s;ee thee, that is
the In&s;ide of thee; for as Ve&s;&s;els are known whether they be broken or
whole by their inward Sound; &s;o is Man from his Speech, which car|ries with
it not only a great Influence, but a great Di&s;covery of our Minds; and
Integrity herein is the publick Faith of Mankind. With all &s;orts of Men we
&s;hould deal ingeniou&s;ly yet re&s;er|vedly, &s;aying what we think, but
think|ing more than we &s;ay, it being not good to &s;ay at all Times all that
the Heart think|eth, tho' all that the Heart thinketh be good. Freedom of
Speech is &s;ome|times to be foreborn, lea&s;t we give others Power thereby to
lay hold on the Rudder of our Minds; for in all there are &s;ome Places weaker
than others, and prudent Men will take heed of ly|ing uncover'd that Way: 'Tis
true there may be po&s;&s;ibly in Di&s;cour&s;e a Fault of Omi&s;&s;ion; but
this is a right-hand Error; a Man may be &s;ometimes &s;orry he &s;aid 
<PB N="27" REF="66"> no more, but very often that he &s;aid &s;o much: God hath
given us two Ears and one Mouth, that we ought to Hear more than to Speak; we
have no Ear-Lids to keep us from Hear|ing, and often mu&s;t Hear again&s;t our
Will; but our Mouth &s;huts naturally, and we may keep our Tongue from
Speaking, unle&s;s by Intemperance we lo&s;e that Privilege of Nature.</P>
<P>The Truth is, our Tongue is &s;o &s;lip|pery that is ea&s;ily
deceives a heedle&s;s Guard, Nature hath given it &s;ome un|happy Advantages
towards it, it being the mo&s;t ready for Motion of any Mem|ber, and therefore
is to be the more carefully managed; the chiefe&s;t Rules to be pre&s;cribed
herein, are Sufficiency and Pertinency, a Man &s;hould not only know what to
&s;ay, but what not to &s;ay, for in Speech enough is better than all; Words
are but the Lacquies of Rea&s;on, of which to &s;end more than will per|form
the Bu&s;ine&s;s is &s;uperfluous, and the Di&s;cretion in Speaking, is not
&s;o much in Speaking few Words, as in Speaking none Impertinent; otherwi&s;e
the Dumb were Born with great Ad|vantage, if we mu&s;t retrench the U&s;e of
the Tongue, in&s;tead of moderating it.</P>

as might an&s;wer that Character, no Man ever attempting to put Froth and
Bubbles into the Scales.</P>
<P>When <HI>Zeno</HI> heard a young Man full of Talk, <HI>Aures inquit
in linguam de|flux&ecirc;re,</HI> he &s;aid, His Ears were fallen into his
Tongue; intimating thereby, that they &s;hould Hear much and Speak little: The
Truth is, when People are very young, they cannot Judge rightly of any Thing;
and it happens either by Experience, Reflections, or meeting with &s;ome
intelligent Per&s;ons, they come to be of another Mind, and de|&s;pi&s;e that
which they once &s;o much ad|mir'd, and many Times laugh at them|&s;elves, when
they examine them&s;elves without Flattery. It is certain, he that always Talks
adventures him&s;elf too far, thereby depriving him&s;elf of Ob&s;erva|tion,
which is the great Advantage of Society, and from whence comes Expe|rience and
Wi&s;dom: Herein we &s;hould imitate cunning Shopkeepers, who &s;hew their
Wares in a half Light, upon Oc|ca&s;ion we &s;hould Speak but &s;paringly, and
rather Starve than Surfeit our Au|ditors. <PB N="29" REF="68"> Our
Di&s;cour&s;es mu&s;t not be too florid in the beginning; it is a Thing much to
be wi&s;hed, that all which one &s;ays be good and fine, according as the
Subject merits; but we mu&s;t proceed by Degrees; Nature is in this, as in all
other Things, a very knowing Mi&s;tre&s;s; con|&s;ider how She proceeds
in&s;en&s;ibly, the faire&s;t Day when it begins to break and appear, hath &s;o
little Light, that it is hardly di&s;cernable whether it be Day or Night; and
nothing is &s;o great a &s;ign that the way of Speaking is noble, as when it
leaves &s;ome certain Things to be apprehended without Speaking them; and
therefore it is good to know when to give over, and to proceed to other
Matters, or at lea&s;t we &s;hould give them another Face and Turn, becau&s;e
Diver|ver&s;ity &s;eems not tedious.</P>
<P>To make our &s;elves be heard with Plea&s;ure, we mu&s;t &s;ay
&s;uch Things as others will be glad to hear, and &s;ay them plea&s;antly,
which is the be&s;t way to make us be belov'd; be&s;ides, when we plea&s;e
others well, we are likewi&s;e better pleas'd with our &s;elves. Excellent
Painters ne|ver draw all, they &s;till allow &s;omething for you to exerci&s;e
your own Imagina|tion, and always leave you more to find out than they
di&s;cover; The Graces ap|pear <PB N="30" REF="69"> very rarely, and even when
they are &s;een, they will not be con&s;ider'd full fac'd nor uncover'd; in the
&s;ame manner we &s;hould not open our &s;elves too much; and in our
Di&s;cour&s;es we &s;hould ob&s;erve this as a general Rule, Either to Speak
fitly, or to be Silent wi&s;ely; for many by their Silence may pa&s;s for
Wi&s;e Men, whom Speech would pre&s;ently di&s;cover otherwi&s;e. When the
A&s;s di&s;gui&s;ed him&s;elf in the Lyon's Skin, he frighted all the Bea&s;ts,
and even the cunning Fox, till he heard him Bray. <HI>Pro certo &s;cias ni&s;i
rudentem audivi&s;&s;em &amp; te ego timue&s;&s;em:</HI> Unlearned Men, which
&s;eem of Ability to Strangers, are quickly di&s;cover'd by their Loquacity,
and tho&s;e that &s;peak much in Company &s;eldom &s;peak well, for they that
well under&s;tand them&s;elves know not how to dwell in Talk. <HI>Long
Di&s;cour&s;es,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Plutarch, like over-feather'd Arrows, &s;hoot
beyond the Mark, and by wearying the Attention, ordinarily lo&s;e both Game and
Labour. Ari&s;totle</HI> an&s;wer'd a Man well, who having held him in a long
Di&s;cour&s;e, in the end begg'd his Excu&s;e, telling him he might have
&s;av'd his Apo|logy, for he had not minded what he &s;aid. And it was a
&s;mart Reply of <HI>Theo|critus</HI> to an ill Poet, repeating many of 
<PB N="31" REF="70"> his Ver&s;es, and asking which he liked be&s;t,
an&s;wer'd, <HI>Tho&s;e which he had omit|ted:</HI> And indeed, the Company of
&s;uch who Talk much to little Purpo&s;e, ought as little to be regarded; for
if a Man be vain and trifling in his Di&s;|cour&s;es, both he that hears, and
he that an&s;wers, will be equal Lo&s;ers of their Time. And if we &s;hut our
Ears to tri|fling Di&s;cour&s;es, much more carefully ought we to keep our
Hearts from drawing in the Breath of ob&s;cene Di&s;|cour&s;es, which are the
very Pe&s;t of Con|ver&s;ation. We &s;hould herein imitate <HI>Xenocrates</HI>
the Philo&s;opher, who being asked an ob&s;cene Que&s;tion, and giving no
an&s;wer, being again importun'd to An&s;wer, &s;aid well; <HI>De tali re te
homi|nem vanum interrogare decet, me autem re&s;pondere nequaquam:</HI>
Ob&s;cene Speeches, like Oil falling upon Linnen, will &s;pread much; and as
the Poi&s;on of the Body enters by the Mouth, &s;o the Poi&s;on of the Heart
enters by the Ear; and there|fore tho&s;e who have Hone&s;ty in their Hearts,
will have only civil and mode&s;t Words in their Mouths.</P>
<P>Next to Mode&s;ty in our Conver&s;ation, we mu&s;t be careful not to
be too inqui|&s;itive into other Men's Affairs; and if we would be per&s;uaded
to affect a <PB N="32" REF="71"> whol&s;om Ignorance therein, it would much
conduce to our Ea&s;e and Inno|cence; for it is the Itch of the Ear that breaks
out at the Tongue, and were not Curio&s;ity the Purveyor, this Trade would
&s;oon be &s;et a&s;ide. The Boy in <HI>Plutarch</HI> being ask'd what he
carried hid under his Cloak, an&s;wer'd well, <HI>That he there|fore carried it
&s;o, that the other might not know it.</HI> An un&s;ea&s;onable Inquiry into
Things &s;hews a great Weakne&s;s and Folly in the Inquiror.</P>
<P>When <HI>Socrates</HI> was asked by a curi|ous Per&s;on, What was
done in the next World; he told him, <HI>He had never been there, nor &s;poken
with any that came from thence.</HI> St. <HI>Augu&s;tin</HI> tells us,
<HI>Cu|rio&s;us e&s;t qui ea avid&egrave; &s;crutatur quae ad &s;e non

<P>We &s;hall &s;ee &s;ome Men very inqui&s;i|tive into the Religion of
their Acquain|tance, being very &s;hy of di&s;cour&s;ing with Men of differing
Per&s;ua&s;ions, and put on an angry Zeal again&s;t them, be|lieving they are
fighting God Almighty's Quarrel, and therefore grow into a hardned Severity
again&s;t all who di&s;|&s;ent from them; And we &s;hall frequent|ly &s;ee Men,
who&s;e Manners and Con|ditions are very conformable in all the 
<PB N="33" REF="72"> nece&s;&s;ary Obligations of Human Socie|ty, to avoid each
others Company, and grow un&s;ociable to each other, meerly becau&s;e the one
cannot think as the other does: Whereas our Opinions come from our Heads, our
Affections from our Hearts; and therefore a wi&s;e Man will no more trouble
him&s;elf about his Companions Religion, than about the Religion of his
Phy&s;ician or Lawyer: The Offices of Friend&s;hip which one Man owes to
another, having nothing to do with that Con&s;ideration; and Men do not &s;o
much que&s;tion, whether their Servants be Virtuous, as whether they be
Diligent, which is the Thing for which they make u&s;e of them. But yet this is
a pernicious Error, for Men to think them&s;elves no otherwi&s;e concer|ned in
their Servants, than they are in their Hor&s;es and Oxen, to look upon them
only as another Species of work|ing Cattle; and, &s;o they do their
Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, care not how arrant Brutes they be: Whereas Gentlemen &s;hould
con|&s;ider, that they with them&s;elves are com|mon Servants to one great
Ma&s;ter; and that the Subjection of one to the other, is but the wi&s;e
Oeconomy of their Lord, who hath made the one as Stewards or Supervi&s;ors to
regulate the re&s;t, and <PB N="34" REF="73"> then it will appear a great
Unfaithful|ne&s;s to neglect this Charge; for tho' they receive Wages, they are
not below their Care, Nature having made no &s;uch Di|&s;tinction, and Returns
of Kindne&s;s and good U&s;age are as much their Due to &s;uch of them as
de&s;erve it, as their Ser|vice is due to their Ma&s;ters when they require it.
But leaving this Digre&s;&s;ion, there are others &s;o far from this
Nice|ne&s;s, that in their Di&s;cour&s;es they de|&s;pi&s;e and mock at
Religion, becau&s;e they would not be under the Re&s;traints of it; Religion is
again&s;t them, and therefore they &s;et them&s;elves again&s;t Re|ligion; and
it is ob&s;ervable, that tho&s;e who upon other Subjects their be&s;t Friends
mu&s;t needs acknowledge to be &s;ufficiently dull, yet can talk very wit|tily
in derogation of Religion, with &s;ome kind of &s;alt and &s;martne&s;s; and
becau&s;e Religion frets them, it makes them wynch and fling, and gives them
&s;ome kind of Wit and Sharpne&s;s in rallying again&s;t it. The&s;e are
Per&s;ons that ne|ver &s;ay any Thing well, but what is ill to &s;ay; and
therefore we mu&s;t be very careful to di&s;tingui&s;h between what ex|acts the
Title of Wit from our Judg|ments, and that which appears but &s;uch to our
Corruptions: This prophane Li|berty <PB N="35" REF="74"> is too much us'd in
our Nation, and hath cro&s;&s;ed tho&s;e Seas which en|viron <HI>England,</HI>
which is not &s;o happily &s;ever'd from the World's Vices, as from its
Continent: But I wonder how &s;uch Men &s;hould have the Fortune to be
e|&s;teemed Wits, only for Je&s;ting out of the common Road, and for making
bold to &s;coff at tho&s;e Things, which ought to be reverenced of all Mankind;
But we are fallen into &s;uch a prophane and &s;ceptical an Age, as takes a
Plea&s;ure and Pride in unravelling almo&s;t all the received Principles of
Religion.</P>
<P>However, we mu&s;t not think the wor&s;e of Religion, becau&s;e
&s;ome Men are &s;o bold as to de&s;pi&s;e and deride it; for it is no
Di&s;paragement for any Per|&s;on or Thing to be Laughed at, but to de&s;erve
to be &s;o; there being nothing &s;o excellent but a Man may find Ways to
traduce it, and therefore we ought not to have the le&s;s Reverence for the
Principles of Religion, becau&s;e idle and prophane Per&s;ons can break Je&s;ts
upon them, for a little Wit with a great deal of ill Nature will ea&s;ily
furni&s;h a Man for Satyre; there being nothing &s;o Sa|cred, which by the
petulancy of Wit, may not be made ridiculous; and tho&s;e Buffoons which do
&s;o, &s;pare neither <PB N="36" REF="75"> their Souls nor Reputation to &s;hew
their Abilities, by prophane more than inge|nious Sallies: But it were happy if
Men would u&s;e a nobler Exerci&s;e for their Wits, than to per&s;i&s;t in
their &s;coffing Humour, which is not only an Enemy to Religion, but to every
Thing el&s;e that is worthy; and yet we &s;hall &s;ee &s;ome Men &s;o prophane,
as to make u&s;e of Scripture Phra&s;es to give a reli&s;h to their mo&s;t
in&s;ipid Di&s;cour&s;es; and were it not for this Magazine, a great many Men's
Raillery would want Supplies, and they would be very Mute without this Topick.
In our Conver&s;ation, we &s;hould carefully avoid the cu&s;tomary Sin of
Swearing, which hath none of tho&s;e Allurements which other Sins have; &s;uch
Men play the Platonick to Damnation; and the great wonder is, that we &s;ee
none who own God more in their Oaths, than tho&s;e that di&s;-own him in their
Lives; a great Ab&s;urdity of Wicked|ne&s;s, to have a God to Swear by, none to
Believe in, none to Pray to. There is indeed &s;uch a Deluge of Impiety and
Prophane&s;s at this Day overflowing our afflicted Nation, that it hath brought
down mo&s;t terrible Judgments upon it: Wickedne&s;s is now become the Mode and
Fa&s;hion among&s;t them; &s;o that Men <PB N="37" REF="76"> there begin now to
fear the Singularity of being Innocent; and a Man may with le&s;s Scorn appear
there in the an|tiquated Habit of our Forefathers, than to own the ob&s;olete
and condemned Qualities of true Piety, Loyalty, Duty and Sobriety; And what
Temptation is it to the Vulgar to be Wicked, when their Superiors have beaten
the Path before them: When Gentlemen are Athei&s;tical, Clowns will think
them|&s;elves very mode&s;tly Wicked if they be but Prophane; and when they
hear their Betters &s;wear, they will &s;oon find they are as well qualified
for that part of Greatne&s;s as the be&s;t. It were very happy for our Nation,
if tho&s;e Seducers of the People would &s;ound a Retreat to their mi&s;-led
Followers, and would teach them Religion, Obedience, and Submi&s;&s;ion, as
they have formerly led them to Impiety and Di&s;obedience.</P>
<P>But to return to our intended Di&s;|cour&s;e; Gentlemen in their
Conver&s;a|tion ought never to reveal Secrets. Our Eyes, Tongues and Looks, are
the Win|dows and Doors of our Hearts, we &s;hould therefore be cautious to keep
every thing from breaking out, which may be &s;afelier hid than revealed. The
Wits of futilous Per&s;ons are like the <PB N="38" REF="77"> Ve&s;&s;els of the
<HI>Danaides,</HI> that emptied as fa&s;t as they fill'd; that which comes in
at the Ear, goes pre&s;ently out at the Mouth, becau&s;e Indi&s;cretion, which
di|rects to hearken, as lightly as to Speak, lets fly out, as ea&s;ily as lets
in, and di&s;|per&s;es as &s;oon as collects. The&s;e pub|li&s;h what they
know, only that they may be telling of News, an itch where|with their Tongues
are &s;trangely over|run, who can as well hold a glowing Coal in their Mouths,
as keep any thing Secret which they think new, which is a mo&s;t childi&s;h
Vanity, and Men mu&s;t have Souls of a very low level, that can think this a
fit Entertainment: The&s;e Men not having u&s;ually Depth enough to &s;upply
them&s;elves out of their own Store, can therefore let nothing pa&s;s by them,
no more than a Mill, which is always going, cannot afford any Water to run
wa&s;te. Now the&s;e Men are more Impertinent, and not le&s;s Injurious than
the mo&s;t Malicious; <HI>Anacreon,</HI> who was choaked with a Grape-&s;tone,
died as &s;urely as <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> with his Three and twenty Wounds;
and a Man's Re|putation is as &s;oon fool'd and prated a|way, as maliciou&s;ly
Betray'd, nay per|haps more ea&s;ily; for where the Speaker can lea&s;t be
&s;u&s;pected of De&s;ign, the <PB N="39" REF="78"> Hearer is the apter to give
him Cre|dit; and this way of in&s;inuating, is like tho&s;e Poi&s;ons taken in
at the Pores, which are mo&s;t in&s;en&s;ibly &s;ucked in, and the mo&s;t
difficult to expel. The&s;e Men are &s;o perpetually Bu&s;ie, and con|tinually
employ'd in finding Faults with others, that they cannot look towards
them&s;elves; and whil&s;t they put fal&s;e Dre&s;&s;es and Varni&s;hes to hide
their own Deformity, they cannot allow the lea&s;t Imperfection of another's to
remain un|detected. If the&s;e Men would look in|to their own Hearts, they
would find &s;uch work for their Inqui&s;itions and Cen&s;ure, that they
&s;hould not be at lei&s;ure to Ramble abroad for it: Now &s;uch as Bu&s;ie
them&s;elves with Tales of their Neighbours, and entertain Com|pany with them,
furni&s;h their Wits, as young Girls do their Clo&s;ets, with Shells and
Gew-Gaws; and &s;ince they be&s;tow their Time &s;o ill, they &s;hould Study
the Anatomy of Flies; and to puni&s;h their Bodies as well as their Minds, they
&s;hould live only upon Shrimps, where|in there is more Bu&s;ine&s;s than Meat:
It is indeed a gro&s;s Error to think (&s;o we &s;peak in Truth) we may declare
any Mans Faults, for we mu&s;t as well &s;peak in Charity as Truth, and yet
many Men <PB N="40" REF="79"> will &s;lide ea&s;ily into Detraction, think|ing
it no great Matter, not con&s;idering the &s;malle&s;t Sins are the Devils
greate&s;t Stratagems; and if <HI>Satan</HI> fetter us, it is indifferent to
him, whether it be by a Cable, or by a Hair: St. <HI>Augu&s;tin</HI> therefore,
who was &s;en&s;ible of the com|monne&s;s of this Vice, had this follow|ing
Di&s;tick written over his Table. 
<Q> 
<L>Qui&s;quis amat dictis ab&s;entum rodere vitam,</L> 
<L>Hanc men&s;am vetitam noverit e&s;&s;e &s;ibi.</L></Q> The Truth
is, we &s;hould never in our Di&s;cour&s;es make ab&s;ent Per&s;ons the Subject
of our Mirth; tho&s;e Freedoms which we u&s;e to a Man's Face, are com|monly
more moderate and equitable, becau&s;e we expo&s;e our &s;elves to the like
from him; but Backblows are di&s;inge|nious, &s;hewing we intend not a fair
Tryal of Wit, but a cowardly Murther of a Man's Fame: But &s;ome Men think
their Wits to be a-&s;leep, if they dart not out &s;omething that is piquant,
and pier|ceth to the Quick, but this Vein ought to be bridled. 
<Q>Parce puer &s;timulis, &amp; fortius utere loris.</Q> 
<PB N="41" REF="80"> There is great difference between Salt|ne&s;s and
Bitterne&s;s, and no Weapon cuts &s;o deep as a reproachful Word, neither is
any Wound longer in curing; And tho&s;e Jeers are mo&s;t re&s;ented which touch
a Man's Reputation, chiefly that of Wit and Di&s;cretion, of which even Fools
&s;eem wary, and few will confe&s;s their Ignorance: The Reproaches of Wit are
like the Corrodings of <HI>Aqua fortis,</HI> they ingrave and indent
Chara|cters that can never be defaced; a dull Reproach quickly vani&s;hes, no
Per&s;on thinking it worth remembring, but when 'tis &s;teel'd with Wit, it

<P>Defamation is certainly one of the mo&s;t unkind De&s;igns that one
Man can have upon another, every Man being naturally tender of his Reputation,
which yields a Perfume even after Death, and a Man's Reputation can hardly be
to&s;&s;ed without receiving &s;ome Brui&s;e; the hea|vy Scandals under which
&s;ome Men have lain, having taken their Ri&s;e only from &s;ome Inadvertence
or Indi&s;cretion; and even doubtful Accu&s;ations leave a Stain behind them,
and often prove indelible Injuries to the Party accu&s;ed: And as in the Ca&s;e
of Stealing, it is Proverbially &s;aid, <HI>If there were no Receivers, there
would be no Thieves</HI>; &s;o in this of Slan|der, if there were fewer
Spreaders, there would be fewer Forgers of Libels, the Manufacture would be
di&s;couraged, if it had not the&s;e Retailers to put off the Wares. A Man may
&s;ometimes do Things which to God and his own Con|&s;cience are abominable,
and yet keep <PB N="43" REF="82"> his Reputation with Men, but when his
&s;ecret Crimes are detected, then he becomes infamous; &s;o that tho' his own
Sin be the material Cau&s;e, yet the Di&s;|covery is the formal Cau&s;e of his
Infa|my; and he that hath divulg'd his Fault &s;tands accountable for all the
Con&s;e|quences that flow from that divulg|ing.</P>
<P>Some Men are maliciou&s;ly apt to run down the Reputation of any
that &s;tand in their way either of Plea&s;ure or Pre|ferment: When
<HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>'s Cha&s;tity had changed the Scene of <HI>Potiphar</HI>'s
Wife's Pa&s;&s;ion, &s;he pre&s;ently fixes the Crime upon him: So when
<HI>Ziba</HI> had a Mind to undermine <HI>Mephibo&s;eth</HI> in his E&s;tate,
he fir&s;t practi&s;es upon his Fame in a fal&s;e Accu&s;ation: And how often
have we &s;een in our Time the&s;e Scenes re|acted; and tho' many Men have been
Wicked enough to commit this Crime, yet none have been &s;o Impudent as to avow
it; all Crimes have had their Abettors, only this Sort of impudent and lying
Slander is &s;o much the Dregs and Refu&s;e of wicked Men, that none have yet
had Chymi&s;try enough to Sub|limate it, and to bring it into &s;uch a
Re|putation, that any Man would think fit to own it, till our la&s;t infamous
Age of <PB N="44" REF="83"> in&s;ulting Vice, where this Wickedne&s;s has not
only been admitted into Pra|ctice, but appears al&s;o bare-faced, which did
always before keep on the Vizard; for no Man had ever the Confidence before to
own him&s;elf a fal&s;e Accu&s;er of his Brethren, till that mo&s;t wicked Age,
which hath not only permitted, but encouraged and rewarded Men for being
fal&s;e Accu&s;ers, to the eternal Re|proach of our Nation, and of them that
&s;uffered it.</P>
<P>Next to avoiding the Conver&s;ation of the&s;e foremention'd, we
&s;hould be cau|tious of Conver&s;ing with &s;uch who Cen&s;ure and Judge
&s;everely of other Men's Actions, which is one of the highe&s;t Violations of
Charity; and a good Man will never make &s;evere Con|&s;tructions, but &s;et
every Thing in the faire&s;t Light, and put upon it the mo&s;t candid
Interpretation that the Matter will bear, which is of great Importance to the
Reputation of our Neighbour: For he that gives the fir&s;t ill Character of a
Man, fixes the Stamp, which ever after goes currant in the World, it being the
Bu&s;ine&s;s of many to lay on more Load, but of few to take it off; for mo&s;t
People le&s;&s;en their own Beam into a Moat, and magnifie their Neighbour's 
<PB N="45" REF="84"> Moat into a Beam: They turn the re|ver&s;e End of the
Per&s;pective to repre&s;ent their own Faults &s;mall and at a di&s;tance, and
&s;huffle the other End to their Neighbour, to make theirs &s;eem great. Now
&s;uch as make bitter Invectives a|gain&s;t other Men's Faults, and indulge and
palliate their own, &s;hew their Zeal lies in their Spleen, and con&s;ider not
&s;o much what is done, as who does it. A Man that affects an extraordinary
Splendor of Reputation, is glad to find any Foiles to &s;et him off, and will
there|fore let no Fault nor Folly of another enjoy the Shade, but bring it into
open Light, that by &s;uch Compari&s;on his own Excellencies may appear the
brigh|ter; But this &s;hews a degenerous Spi|rit, and becau&s;e he wants
&s;olid Worth, on which to bottom his Reputation, he is feign to found it on
the Ruins of other Mens. Diamonds &s;parkle in the Sun-&s;hine, 'tis but a
Glow-worm Virtue that owes his Lu&s;tre to the Darkne&s;s about it.
<HI>Tacitus</HI> gives it as an ill In|clination of <HI>Domitian</HI> the
Emperor's Temper, That he imploy'd him&s;elf in catching and tormenting Flies,
and that he turn'd his Scepter into a Fly-flap, and was therefore ju&s;tly
e&s;teem'd an Enemy to Flies, and a Fly to his Ene|mies; <PB N="46" REF="85">
and truly they fall not under a much better Character, either for Wi&s;dom or
good Nature, who &s;natch up all the fluttering Reports they can meet with to
the Prejudice of their Neighbour.</P>
<P>Who&s;oever hath a tender Side, the World will be &s;ure to find it,
and to put the wor&s;t Colour on all that Man &s;ays or does, give an
Aggravation to every Thing that may le&s;&s;en him, and a &s;pight|ful Turn to
every Thing that may re|commend him; But that Wit is much mi&s;employ'd, that
is wholly directed to di&s;cern the Faults of others, when it is nece&s;&s;ary
to be u&s;ed to mend and pre|vent his own: When we do not fre|quently turn our
Eyes inward, to &s;ee what is ami&s;s within us, it is a &s;ign we have an
unwelcome Pro&s;pect at home, when we care not to look upon it, but rather
&s;eek our own Con&s;olation in the Faults of tho&s;e we Conver&s;e with.</P>
<P>Indeed, &s;ome Men's Tempers are &s;o malign, that they wi&s;h Ill
to all, and be|lieve Ill of all Men, like <HI>Timon</HI> the
<HI>Athe|nian,</HI> who profe&s;t him&s;elf an univer&s;al Man-Hater: 'Tis
certain there are &s;ome, in who&s;e Ears nothing &s;ounds &s;o har&s;h as the
Commendation of another, and nothing &s;o melodious to them as a De|famation.
<HI>Plutarch</HI> gives an apt In&s;tance <PB N="47" REF="86"> of this upon
<HI>Ari&s;tides</HI>'s Bani&s;hment. When a mean Per&s;on had propos'd
O|&s;traci&s;me, being asked, What Di&s;plea|&s;ure <HI>Ari&s;tides</HI> had
done, he reply'd, None, and that he knew him not, but that it griev'd him to
the Heart, to hear every one call him a Ju&s;t Man. I verily believe &s;ome of
our keene&s;t Ac|cu&s;ers in the&s;e Days might give the &s;ame An&s;wer; for
no Man that is eminent either for Piety, Loyalty, or Moral Vir|tue, but he
&s;hall have many invidious Eyes upon him, watching for his Halt|ing; and if
any the lea&s;t Obliquity be e&s;pied, he is u&s;ed wor&s;e than the vile&s;t
Malefactor, for &s;uch are try'd but at one Bar, but the&s;e are arraigned in
all Com|panies and in all Di&s;cour&s;es.</P>
<P>Next to ra&s;h Cen&s;urers, Flatterers are mo&s;t dangerous, who may
be compar'd to Flies that have pretty &s;hining Wings for two or three hot
Months, but the lea&s;t cold Weather makes an end of them; or rather like the
<HI>Heliotrope,</HI> open only towards the Sun, but &s;hut and con|tract
them&s;elves at Night. Let the Ob|ject of their Adoration be but eclip&s;ed,
they can &s;ee none of tho&s;e Excellencies which before dazzled their Eyes,
and their old Idol is often made a Sacrifice to their new, and all malicious
Di&s;co|very <PB N="48" REF="87"> is made of their falling Friend, to make an
Intere&s;t in their ri&s;ing one. There are &s;uch Crowds of Examples of this
Kind in our Age and mo&s;t un|happy Kingdom, that it is fitter to fur|ni&s;h
Precedents for the future, than to borrow any of the pa&s;t Times.</P>
<P>This is certainly the mo&s;t horrid Crime that could be committed,
and the black|e&s;t Colour wherein we can view a Para|&s;ite; and as an Ape
hath a peculiar De|formity above other Brutes, by that awkard and ungraceful
Re&s;emblance he has to a Man; &s;o a Flatterer is infinite|ly more hateful,
for being the ugly Coun|terfeit of a Friend. A Pretence of Friend|&s;hip and
Kindne&s;s is now become the general Bait to all ba&s;e Projects, all the
woolfi&s;h De&s;igns that have been lately acted upon our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Stage, have walked under this Sheeps Cloathing; and as the World goes, Men have
more need to beware of tho&s;e who call them|&s;elves Friends, than tho&s;e who
own them&s;elves Enemies, becau&s;e the one traiterou&s;ly Betrays you,
whil&s;t you ex|pect no better from the other.</P>
<P>It was heretofore the Character given of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> by
an ingenious Per&s;on, That they were both excellently En|dowed, and rarely
tempered by God <PB N="49" REF="88"> and Nature, and were the mo&s;t piou&s;ly
affected of all others; and that there were not in the whole World either
better Catholicks or better Prote&s;tants; that there was no Nation under
Heaven more remote from ill Nature and Re|venge, nor Men who were more
ho|ne&s;tly and even more naturally Ju&s;t, nor &s;o far di&s;tant from u&s;ing
ba&s;e Treachery of every Kind. But, alas, the Race is now &s;poiled by
mixture, and we are no more what we were, every one endea|vouring to Deceive
and Delude each other; and that Freedom and good Na|ture, (which was thought
peculiar to <HI>England</HI>) which is a kind of Bal&s;om to the whole Life of
Man, (and without which Life is no better than a Puni&s;h|ment, both to others,
and mo&s;t of all to a Man's &s;elf) is bani&s;hed out of our Na|tion, and
tho&s;e Flowers of Virtue, which were thought to grow no where el&s;e but in
our I&s;land, are now degenerated into Weeds of Flattery, Treachery, and
Un|dermining: Now the Suppre&s;&s;ion of this Vice depends upon tho&s;e
Per&s;ons to whom it is addre&s;&s;ed; let but Princes entertain &s;uch
Para&s;ites with a &s;evere Brow, and with &s;harp Expre&s;&s;ions of
Di&s;like, the&s;e Leeches will immediate|ly fall off. In <HI>Sparta,</HI> when
all Laws <PB N="50" REF="89"> again&s;t Theft prov'd ineffectual, at la&s;t
they fixed the Penalty upon them that were robbed, and that did the
Bu&s;ine&s;s; and if it were made among&s;t us as in|famous to be Flatter'd, as
it is to Flat|ter, I believe it might have the &s;ame Effect.</P>
<P><HI>Plutarch</HI> gives an excellent Exam|ple of a Man that could
not be per&s;ua|ded to Flatter, in the Per&s;on of <HI>Phi|loxenus,</HI> who
being a good Poet, and de&s;pi&s;ing &s;ome dull Poetry of <HI>Diony&s;ius</HI>
the Tyrant, he was by him condemned to the Quarries; where having been for
&s;ome Time, he was by the Mediation of Friends recalled; and at his fir&s;t
Ap|pearance, <HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> &s;hew'd him &s;ome other of his Ver&s;es,
which he thought his Ma&s;ter-Piece; which, as &s;oon as <HI>Philoxenus</HI>
had read, he made no Re|ply, but call'd to the Guards to carry him back again
to the Quarries; a brave Example of a Heathen Poet, who pre|ferr'd a corporal
Slavery before a mental.</P>
<P>As it is a great Part of Wi&s;dom not to be flatter'd, &s;o it is to
pa&s;s by the Reproaches of others: Herein we &s;hould imitate
<HI>Socrates,</HI> who being informed of &s;ome derogating Speeches one had
u&s;ed of him behind his Back, made on|ly this Reply, <HI>Let him Beat me
too,</HI> <PB N="51" REF="90"> <HI>when I am ab&s;ent, I care not</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> How|ever, it is good to &s;hun the Company of tho&s;e
who take Plea&s;ure in expo&s;ing others to Contempt and Deri&s;ion, as one
would avoid the Heels of a Hor&s;e that Kicks every one he can reach.</P>
<P>It is the height of Incivility to abu&s;e Per&s;ons in
Di&s;cour&s;e; to abu&s;e Inferiors argues a mean contemptible Spirit,
Su|periors is dangerous; to abu&s;e a Friend is to lo&s;e him; a Stranger, to
lo&s;e your &s;elf in his and the World's E&s;teem: We &s;hould therefore
endeavour to keep a fair Reputation with all Per&s;ons, with Superiors 'tis
good to be humble and complai&s;ant, not low and flattering, with Equals grave
not moro&s;e, with Inferiors courteous and fair, not &s;ullen nor
impe|tuous.</P>
<P>'Tis an indi&s;creet Thing for a Man in Company to take Exceptions;
and if he have any Defect in his Per&s;on, which he &s;u&s;pects Men are apt to
make Deri&s;ion of, 'tis a Folly to vex him&s;elf or quarrel at it; but the
be&s;t way to prevent others in their Scoffs of this kind, is, fir&s;t to
&s;peak, and let them know as much as they can tell him; and then he ought with
a manly Courage, to contemn, as unconcerned, the Indi&s;cretions and Fol|lies
of others: It is no &s;ign a Man is <PB N="52" REF="91"> &s;ound, who complains
becau&s;e one touches him. In my younger Days, I knew an old merry Droll, who
much frequented Company, who having in his Youth taken a great Liberty to rally
upon married Per&s;ons, in his declining Age took a Wife, where every one might
have had her for his Money; and the fir&s;t Treatment of any Friend in his
Conver&s;ation, was &s;till the Di&s;cour&s;e of his own Marriage, to prevent
all that could be &s;aid again&s;t him.</P>
<P>And as we &s;hould not be troubled when others tell us of our
Imperfections, &s;o on the other hand we &s;hould never Prai&s;e our &s;elves:
It is a great Blemi&s;h for a Man to be the Trumpet of his own Excellencies; he
who puts a mo|de&s;t Rate upon his own De&s;erts, does be&s;t multiply his
Fame, but he that &s;peaks in his own Commendations, does as if he meant to
Sell him&s;elf. And if the mo&s;t accompli&s;h'd would but &s;eriou&s;ly
con&s;ider his own Imperfections, how many Things he wants, and how few he
knows, and tho&s;e how lamely, he would make u&s;e of his Rea&s;on and
Di&s;|cour&s;e, not for Commendation of him|&s;elf, but to gain In&s;truction
from others. Such Men's Company is very trouble|&s;ome, who are only
accu&s;tomed to the <PB N="53" REF="92"> Admiration of them&s;elves, thinking
no|thing be&s;ides them worthy of Regard; if the&s;e unbred Minds were made
ac|quainted with tho&s;e Excellencies which God hath be&s;tow'd on other Men,
they would not think them&s;elves like <HI>Gideon</HI>'s Fleece, to <HI>have
&s;ucked up all the Dew of Heaven</HI>; they would find perhaps they rather
an&s;wer'd the other Part of the Miracle, and <HI>are drier than their
Neigh|bours:</HI> And if &s;uch will needs be re|flecting on them&s;elves, let
them com|pare their Crop of Weeds and Nettles with that of their Corn, and then
they mu&s;t either think their Ground is Poor, or them&s;elves very ill
Husbands.</P>
<P>Now the way to Profit by Conver&s;a|tion mu&s;t come from our
&s;elves, our Que&s;tion is the Fire, that draws out ei|ther the
Quinte&s;&s;ence or the Dreggs of Things; and therefore the u&s;efulle&s;t Part
of Di&s;cour&s;e is to give Occa&s;ion by ask|ing Que&s;tions, by intermingling
our Di&s;|cour&s;es with Tales, with Rea&s;ons, and telling of Opinions, it
being a Te&s;timo|ny of as much Knowledge, to ask a pertinent Que&s;tion, as to
give a perti|nent An&s;wer: But herein a great Re|gard is to be had in what
Company we do it, for great Men love not to be asked Que&s;tions, unle&s;s
where Que&s;tions <PB N="54" REF="93"> may pull out the Thread of their own
Prai&s;es: He that in Di&s;cour&s;e que&s;tions much, &s;hall undoubtedly learn
much, if he apply his Que&s;tions to the Skill of the Per&s;ons with whom he
Di&s;cour&s;es, and put them upon tho&s;e Things they under&s;tand be&s;t; for
thereby he &s;hall do them a Kindne&s;s, in giving them Occa|&s;ion to plea&s;e
them&s;elves in Speaking, becau&s;e every one loves to Speak of that wherein he
is mo&s;t expert, and him&s;elf &s;hall continually gather Knowledge, by
fetching from every one the be&s;t that is in him; for when Men are reduced to
Speak of tho&s;e Things wherein they are mo&s;t conver&s;ant and skillful, the
con|ver&s;ing with them is an excellent School: But we &s;hall commonly &s;ee
Men take the contrary Cour&s;e, chu&s;ing rather to Di&s;cour&s;e of any other
Profe&s;&s;ion than their own, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be &s;o much new Reputation
gotten; but this way a Man &s;hall never come to Perfection: As for Tales, to
tell a Story well, to continue it in a hand&s;ome Method, cloathing it with
&s;uitable Expre&s;&s;ions without Impertinencies, and to repre|&s;ent therein
Per&s;ons and Things to the Life, is one of the be&s;t, and perhaps one of the
harde&s;t Parts of Conver&s;a|tion. The late King <HI>Charles</HI> II. my 
<PB N="55" REF="94"> Ma&s;ter, of Glorious Memory, had a mo&s;t particular
Talent of this Kind, and was wonderful plea&s;ant in Conver&s;ation; and us'd,
very frequently &s;oon after his Re&s;tauration, to have his private Sallies in
the Winter-Evenings, to divert him|&s;elf with &s;ome particular Per&s;ons of
Wit, whom he &s;till cho&s;e to Sup with him, where I had the Honour divers
Times, by his Maje&s;ty's Command, to wait up|on him at Supper; (for he would
then have none of the Grooms of his Bed|chamber with him.) In the&s;e
Diverti&s;e|ments the King permitted tho&s;e who Supped with him to make u&s;e
of their Wits in telling &s;ome plea&s;ant Stories, and in quick and hand&s;om
Repartees, wherein the King had an excellent Vein, and would as well take as
give without Offence; which Liberty was always us'd with great Re&s;pect by
tho&s;e who had the Honour to Sup with him; which were u&s;ually, (<HI>Hannibal
Se&s;ted,</HI> ba&s;e Bro|ther to the then King of <HI>Denmark</HI>) the Duke
of <HI>Ormond,</HI> the Lords <HI>Carling|ford, Wentworth,</HI> and
<HI>Crofts,</HI> with Sir <HI>Frederick Cornwallis,</HI> Sir <HI>John
Mynnis,</HI> and &s;ometimes <HI>Tom Killigrew.</HI> In the&s;e
Conver&s;ations, I have heard excellent Di&s;cour&s;es, witty Repartees,
mingled with plea&s;ant Tales, wherein the King <PB N="56" REF="95"> had &s;o
great a Faculty, that &s;carce any Thing could be &s;aid, which he would not
Parallel with &s;ome plea&s;ant modern Story, which He would tell with &s;uch
Grace and Quickne&s;s as charm'd all the Company; but when he found them warmd
with Wine, and that their Wits began to be piquant and &s;harp, and to Sting
each other, the King would always then interpo&s;e his Royal Authority, and
would &s;troak over the &s;evere Nips they gave each other, by throwing Du&s;t
up|on them, telling them, <HI>Good Je&s;ts ought to bite like Lambs, not Dogs;
to Tickle, not Wound:</HI> Wherein his Maje&s;ty &s;hew'd great Prudence, for
we have &s;een in our Days many Examples of the Mi&s;|chiefs that have hapned
by too &s;evere Railleries; in &s;uch Fencings Je&s;t hath prov'd Earne&s;t,
and Florets have been turn'd to Swords, and not only the Friend&s;hip, but the
Men have fallen a Sacrifice to the Je&s;t: 'Tis &s;ure we &s;hall die in
Earne&s;t, and it will not become us always to live in Je&s;t; But the Gift of
Raillery in this Age hath devoured the more &s;olid Qualifications, and is
accounted the greate&s;t Accompli&s;hment; a &s;trange inverted E&s;timate, to
prefer the little Ebullitions of Wit before &s;olid Rea&s;on and Judgment; if
the&s;e Men <PB N="57" REF="96"> &s;hould accommodate their Diet at the &s;ame
Rate, they &s;hould eat the Husk rather than the Pea&s;e, and feed upon Froth
and Bubbles.</P>
<P>There is nothing more becoming a Gentleman than a Cheerfulne&s;s in
Con|ver&s;ation, every Thing being by &s;o much the more lively and cheerful,
as it comes nearer to its Creation, and nothing hath more light and
&s;prightfulne&s;s in it, than an ingenious conver&s;able Integri|ty: Virtue is
the Mind's con&s;tant Health, the Pul&s;e of it &s;till beats true and even|ly;
&s;he is &s;prightly without Levity, free without Di&s;compo&s;ure, and
conver&s;able without Coyne&s;s or Cheapne&s;s, as free from Stupidity as
Lightne&s;s, from being a Log as a Squib. Be&s;ides, a Vivacity of Spirit is
u&s;ually accompanied with &s;uch a kind of Wit as makes us accept|able in
Conver&s;ation: Cheerful Per&s;ons being graceful in all they do, are mo&s;t
valuable in Company; For who had not rather a&s;&s;ociate him&s;elf with a
Merry conceited Humour, than with a <HI>Cynical</HI> Wi&s;e Man? Many Men
indeed blame Mirth becau&s;e they cannot endure it; which is to blame the Sun,
becau&s;e Owls cannot endure the Brightne&s;s of it; as if we &s;hould Quarrel
with Light, be|cau&s;e our weak Eyes are dazzled with its Beams.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="97">There are &s;ome Men who&s;e Di&s;po&s;i|tions
lead them to fa&s;ten and feed on Mi&s;eries, and to glide over the
Plea|&s;ures of this Life; which puts me in Mind of what pa&s;&s;ed betwixt
<HI>Diogenes</HI> the Cynick, and <HI>Ari&s;tippus</HI> the Cour|tier, who
pa&s;&s;ing by <HI>Diogenes</HI> as he was at Dinner in his Tub,
<HI>Diogenes</HI> &s;aid to him, <HI>If you could content your &s;elf, as I do,
with Bread and Garlick, you would not be the King of</HI> Syracu&s;e <HI>his
Slave: And you,</HI> reply'd <HI>Ari&s;tippus, if you knew how to live with
Princes, you would not make &s;uch bad Cheer.</HI> 'Tis true, this moro&s;e and
pedantick Philo&s;ophy is not de&s;igned for a Gentleman, they are born to be
Sociable, and ought to under&s;tand all the Maxims of the World; Com|plai&s;ant
Humours, a&s;&s;i&s;ted with this practical Knowledge, gain the Friend|&s;hip
of all People, becau&s;e they know how to &s;et forth gracefully the Ta|lents
of Nature.</P>
<P>There is no Means &s;o powerful and appo&s;ite to divert the fixed
and intent Cares of the Mind, and to exhilerate a &s;orrowful Heart, as
plea&s;ant Company and Mu&s;ick, which mollifyeth our Minds, and &s;tays the
tempe&s;tuous Affections of it, if there be any Dregs of Cares that lie lurking
in our Thoughts, mo&s;t power|fully <PB N="59" REF="98"> it wipes them all
away. They &s;ay, <HI>Alexander</HI> one Day excited by the Mu|&s;ick of a
Harp, took Arms, and plaid the Part of a Common Soldier <HI>David</HI>
him&s;elf charm'd the Evil Spirit in the Body of his Father-in-Law, by the
Sweetne&s;s of his Harmony; and we daily &s;ee the Terror of Death cannot &s;o
much affright Soldiers, as the Sound of Drums and Trumpets does animate them;
the Singing of the Nur&s;e makes the Child quiet; which evidently
demon&s;trates the powerful Effects of it in Nature it &s;elf; and the very
Labouring Men find Satis|faction in it, who Sing in their Work; and without
doubt, the Voice per&s;uades and in&s;tructs much more than Reading, the
fir&s;t being accompanied with certain Spirits which we may call Living, the
other is nothing but the Pourtraicture of the Thoughts of a Dead Man.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Thomas More</HI> in his <HI>&V;topia,</HI> makes Mu&s;ick an
Appendix to every Meal; and <HI>Epictetus</HI> e&s;teems a Table without it to
be no better than a Manger: <HI>Lewis</HI> XI. &s;ays <HI>Comines,</HI> at the
Inter|view betwixt him and <HI>Edward</HI> IV. of <HI>England,</HI> invited him
to come to <HI>Paris,</HI> and told him as a great Part of his En|tertainment,
that <HI>he &s;hould hear mo&s;t &s;weet Voices, exqui&s;ite Mu&s;ick, and
&s;hould not</HI> <PB N="60" REF="99"> <HI>want the Company of fine Ladies, and
the Cardinal of</HI> Bourbon <HI>to be his Con|fe&s;&s;or</HI>; which he
thought &s;ufficient En|dearments to &s;uch a &s;en&s;ual Prince as
<HI>Edward</HI> IV.</P>
<P>Indeed, innocent Mirth and plea&s;ant Company whet out Wits, quicken
our Fancies, and make us afterwards more fit for any Employment: <HI>A merry
Heart is the life of the Fle&s;h,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Solomon, and Gladne&s;s
prolongs his Days</HI>; and is high|ly u&s;eful, when 'tis only our
Diverti&s;e|ment, not our Bu&s;ine&s;s; but the exce&s;s of it is very
ill-becoming, and to &s;et our Wits on the Tenter-hooks for &s;o &s;light a
Purpo&s;e, is abominable: But merry Hu|mours, tho' they have a great
Plea&s;ant|ne&s;s in them, are obnoxious to many, becau&s;e if Je&s;ts (wherein
they are mo&s;t conver&s;ant) be well receiv'd by &s;ome, yet they offend more
than they plea&s;e, and create more Enemies than Friends: For tho' Points of
Wit be very fine in Di&s;cour&s;e, yet if they be made &s;o &s;harp as to draw
Blood, tho&s;e that u&s;e them may have Occa&s;ion to repent of them. 'Tis
true, fla&s;hes of Wit give us a plea|&s;ant Light, &s;o long as they burn not;
but this Liberty mu&s;t be bounded with Caution; for Wit &s;hould rather
&s;erve for a Buckler to defend by a hand&s;ome <PB N="61" REF="100"> Reply,
than a Sword to wound others, tho' with never &s;o facetious a Reproach: In
the&s;e Rencounters therefore the Charge &s;hould be Powder and not Bul|lets;
and we mu&s;t take heed, that we pa&s;s not from this familiar Freedom of
Drollery, which cau&s;es Mirth, to &s;evere Scoffing, which provokes Scorn,
en|dangers Quarrels, and gives an Umbrage of a &s;piteful Intent.</P>
<P>This plea&s;ant kind of Wit is a Talent u&s;ually given to Youth to
play withal, and it is a pretty Gift to begin the World with, if they
under&s;tand the right U&s;e of it; otherwi&s;e it is an unruly Engine, wildly
Striking, &s;ometimes a Friend, and not &s;eldom the Engineer him&s;elf. Sharp
Speeches therefore which fly a|broad like Darts, are to be tenderly us'd; for
tho' they be Shot at others, they are many Times thrown back upon
them|&s;elves: As when the Earl of <HI>Rutland,</HI> who had been
in&s;trumental in the Pre|ferment of Sir <HI>Thomas More</HI> to be Lord
Chancellor of <HI>England,</HI> and thinking the Chancellor did not &s;hew him
that Re|&s;pect he merited, meeting him acciden|tally, he told him in Reproach,
<HI>Honores mutant Mores,</HI> alluding to his Name; which the Lord Chancellor
&s;harply re|turn'd upon him, telling him, <HI>It was</HI> <PB N="62" REF="101"> <HI>not true in</HI> Latin, <HI>but in</HI> Engli&s;h, <HI>That
Honours changed Manners,</HI> which was the Lord <HI>Rutland</HI>'s Sirname.
Thus we &s;hall &s;ee &s;ome Men's Wits whip Oppo&s;i|tion, and manife&s;t the
Quickne&s;s of their Dexterity in the Shapne&s;s of their Re|turns, (like the
Arti&s;ans Weapon, that makes his Enemies Arms his Enemies De&s;truction) and
by a nimble Repartee, turns the Words &s;poken upon the Speaker him&s;elf.
There is much Plea&s;ure in this kind of Wit, there being no &s;uch Stil|latory
as a quick Brain, which refines and makes u&s;e of what&s;oever comes with|in
the Pan for its Reception. But tho&s;e Gentlemen who have this Satyrical Vein,
and make others afraid of their Wit, had need be afraid of other Men's
Me|mories; for many times, after they have given others Occa&s;ion to Laugh,
they are made them&s;elves to Cry.</P>
<P>The Rules to be given herein, are carefully to ob&s;erve Times,
Circum|&s;tances, and Per&s;ons, knowing when to Je&s;t, and when not; to u&s;e
apt and hand|&s;ome Repartees, natural and not affe|cted, that have more Salt
than Gall, &s;peaking what is ju&s;t and proper upon every Occa&s;ion, which is
better than fine Conceits, which yet are liked, if they be good; but
Equivocations, Quib|bling <PB N="63" REF="102"> with Words, and Puns, which
have only the appearance of Wit, are ridicu|lous, and yet the&s;e have brought
&s;ome Men of very ordinary Parts into Cre|dit. There is as much difference
be|tween Je&s;ts pick'd up here and there, and tho&s;e that come from the
Spring-Head, as betwixt wi&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es, and harmonious Fooleries,
between a &s;olid Sufficiency, and what is painted; a Je&s;t &s;hould never be
&s;erv'd up but once, when 'tis Cold the Vigour and Strength of it is gone.
Many refu&s;e to wear Buff becau&s;e 'tis la&s;ting, and a Man of Wit will not
Apparel his Brain in Du|rance. It is therefore plea&s;ant to min|gle Je&s;t
with Earne&s;t, for nothing plea&s;es more than Variety; and it is a dull Piece
of Service to tire any Thing too far: But as all Creatures by &s;ecret
In|&s;tigation love to be doing that in which they are mo&s;t able, &s;o
the&s;e Men of Wit being delighted to hear them&s;elves Talk, cannot contain
them&s;elves within a Mean, nor have Patience &s;ometimes to be Silent, &s;o
that we may ju&s;tly won|der &s;uch ab&s;urd Per&s;ons &s;hould &s;peak &s;o
well: Now there are &s;ome Limits wherein the&s;e kind of Wits ought to be
circum&s;crib'd, there being certain Per&s;ons and Things priviledged from 
<PB N="64" REF="103"> Je&s;ting, as Religion, Matters of State, great
Per&s;ons, any Man's pre&s;ent Bu&s;i|ne&s;s of Importance, and any Ca&s;e that
de&s;erves Pity: To Play upon any Man's Unhappine&s;s or Deformity, is
inhumane, and Men may be as oppre&s;&s;ive by their Parts, as by their Power;
and God did no more de&s;ign the meaner Intellectuals of &s;ome for Triumphs to
the Vanity of the more acute, than he did the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the le&s;s
Powerful, as a Prey to the Avarice and Rapine of the Mighty; and it is a much
greater Barbari&s;m to reproach a Man that wants the Gifts of Nature, than him
that wants tho&s;e of Fortune; for a Beggar may have im|poveri&s;h'd him&s;elf
by his own Fault, but in Natural Defects there is nothing to be charged,
unle&s;s we will arraign that Providence which hath &s;o di&s;po&s;ed: And
tho&s;e whom God hath ble&s;&s;ed with higher Degrees of Sagacity and
Quick|ne&s;s, ought not to look down upon others as Objects of their Contempt
and Scorn, but rather of their Care and Pity, en|deavouring to &s;ecure them
from tho&s;e Mi&s;chiefs to which their Weakne&s;s may expo&s;e them, and their
Folly &s;hould nei|ther di&s;mount our Wi&s;dom, nor violate our own Integrity:
But the World is grown to that pa&s;s, that Men will rather 
<PB N="65" REF="104"> put &s;tumbling Blocks in the way of the Blind, and pull
away the Crutch from the Lame, that they may Sport them|&s;elves to &s;ee them
Tumble, &s;uch a de|light we take in improving the Imper|fections of others,
that it's become the great Excellency of this Age to be dextrous at it. But
good Nature is willing to interpret Things to the be&s;t Sen&s;e, to take
Things by the right Handle, and will never go to the ri|gour of the Matter, nor
break out at others Misfortunes; for to be touchy and peevi&s;h in
di&s;covering a Fault, to kindle like Gun-Powder at the lea&s;t Spark, is a
&s;ign we are perfectly wrapt up in our own Intere&s;t, and that we have
nothing of Sweetne&s;s or Bal&s;om in our Blood. We mu&s;t therefore en|deavour
to &s;weeten our Humour, and keep the Ferment down; and tho' the World be full
of malicious Men, yet by this we &s;hall di&s;appoint the Plea&s;ure of ill
Nature, break the Force of an Af|front, and make the Injury fall upon us like
Hail upon Tiles, rattle without Mi&s;|chief, and at la&s;t to tumble into
Dirt.</P>
<P>To je&s;t at Calamities, is a great &s;ign of ill Nature: When
<HI>Caninius,</HI> a Con|&s;ul of <HI>Rome,</HI> died the &s;ame Day he was
made Con&s;ul, <HI>Cicero</HI> would needs put a <PB N="66" REF="105"> Je&s;t
upon that Accident, and &s;aid, <HI>O vigilanti&s;&s;ime Con&s;ul &s;ub quo
nimo pran&s;us e&s;t, nemo caenavit, nemo dormi|vit, magnum prodigium vidimus,
Cani|nio Con&s;ule, non &s;en&s;imus ver, non e&s;ta|tem, non autumnum: The
State,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>hath had a vigilant Con&s;ul of</HI> Ca|ninius,
<HI>that never Slept in all his Con|&s;ul&s;hip.</HI> But this was ju&s;tly
thought a Fault in <HI>Cicero,</HI> for Calamities are not to be the Subject of
Je&s;ts. <HI>I love Je&s;ts well,</HI> &s;aid a Wi&s;e Man, <HI>but not the
lo&s;s of my Friend</HI>; and tho&s;e who lo&s;e them&s;elves to &s;hew their
Wit, are much like <HI>Helio|dore</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Tricca</HI> in
<HI>The&s;&s;aly,</HI> who having wrote the <HI>Ethiopick</HI> Hi&s;tory ve|ry
politely and elegantly, but withal &s;omewhat loo&s;ely and wantonly, was
thereupon &s;ummoned by a Provincial Synod, who told him, His Work did more
endanger the Manners than profit the Wits of his Readers, as nouri&s;hing
loo&s;e and wanton Conceits in the Heads of Youth; and therefore they gave him
his Choice, either to retract his Book, or leave his Bi&s;hoprick; whereupon he
rather cho&s;e to re&s;ign his Place in the Church, than to lo&s;e the
Reputation of his vain Wit. And every Age &s;hews us remarkable Examples of
this Kind; for Sharpne&s;s of Wit commonly carries <PB N="67" REF="106"> with
it two ill Companions, Pride and Levity; ingenious Per&s;ons mi&s;carrying in
nothing more than in too much plea|&s;ing them&s;elves in the Goodne&s;s of
their own Conceits; where &s;ometimes the like befalls them, which hapned to
<HI>Xeuxis</HI> the famous Painter, who having pictur'd to the Life an old
Woman, &s;o pleas'd him&s;elf in the Conceit of his Work, that he died with
Laughing at it.</P>
<P>Being thus prepar'd with outward and inward Furniture for
Conver&s;ation, it is nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider how and where to be&s;tow it;
for he that is provident of his Time, will be al&s;o Prudent in the Choice of
his Company, and Choice of his Actions, lea&s;t the fir&s;t engage him in
Vanity, and the latter by being Cri|minal, in throwing him&s;elf and his Time
away.</P>
<P>This World is link'd together by Love, and Men by Conver&s;ation;
and one of the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">eate&s;t
Plea&s;ures we enjoy herein, (if duly weighed) is the &s;weet Society of
Friends and Relations, which multi|plies our Joys and divides our Griefs; there
being no &s;tricter Union upon Earth, than that of a virtuous Friend|&s;hip;
and nothing can be more Sati&s;|factory than to Improve and Benefit 
<PB N="68" REF="107"> that Per&s;on who is thus become a Part of us.</P>
<P>Men of Quality love to deck and em|belli&s;h the Place where their
inhabit, and Friends dwell in each other, and therefore cannot but be delighted
in beautifying and adorning tho&s;e Minds they have thus cho&s;en to live in,
by purging them from all Foulne&s;s, and rendring them as &s;plendid and
illu&s;trious as is po&s;&s;ible, and certainly there is no|thing more
ravi&s;hing than a Friend&s;hip thus entertain'd: That Calamities at|tend it as
well as Comforts, is but a weak Objection; for what Goodne&s;s is there without
Temptations, and what Happine&s;s in this World not to be tran&s;|form'd: It is
the Gracefulne&s;s of every Thing that makes it valued; Gold, whil&s;t it is in
the Mine, is good for no|thing; when 'tis cut and beaten into the thinne&s;s of
Leaf-Gold, 'tis wa&s;ted and blown away, and quickly comes to no|thing; but
when it is tempered with &s;uch an Allay, as it may receive a Stamp and
Impre&s;&s;ion, then it is Currant and U&s;eful.</P>
<P>Thus Cynical Men, who out of Pride of their own Parts di&s;dain
Company, and can no more endure Conver&s;ation than Owls the Day-Light, like
Gold in <PB N="69" REF="108"> the Bowels of the Earth, their Parts are
u&s;ele&s;s and good for nothing, who cannot without Offence walk the Pub|lick
Ways; they are Saints indeed in private, and live only to God and to
them&s;elves; but being call'd forth into common Life, they are like Bats in
the Sun, and utterly ignorant of Publick Affairs. And the Conver&s;ation and
Friend&s;hip of tho&s;e who&s;e End is only Civility and mutual Vi&s;its, like
Leaf-Gold they are blown away with every little Wind of Di&s;ta&s;te, or
Neglect of Ceremony; and in an equal Degree to the&s;e are they to be reckon'd,
who are <HI>Amici inter prandium &amp; &s;artaginem, ad o&s;tium tabernae
fratres &amp; amici, ad o&s;ti|um carceris neque fratres neque amici:</HI> But
the u&s;eful and profitable Conver&s;a|tions which give a right Stamp and
Im|pre&s;&s;ion to our Minds, are tho&s;e Friends that will be Supporters to us
in our Pro|&s;perities, Safeguards in our Difficulties, Coun&s;ellors in our
Doubts, and Comforts in our Adver&s;ities. With the&s;e we ought to contract a
&s;trict Acquaintance and Inwardne&s;s, and to embrace their Com|pany upon all
fitting Opportunities, u&s;ing herein a wi&s;e Moderation, which carries with
it both an Honour and Grace of Manners; for to &s;eek Com|pany 
<PB N="70" REF="109"> and to fly it, are two Extreams to be blamed; to &s;hun
all Company argues a Contempt of others, and makes us generally hated; and to
&s;eek too much after them, is a &s;ign of Idlene&s;s in our &s;elves, and
makes us &s;lighted: We mu&s;t love our Neighbours as our &s;elves; and to
&s;hew that we love them, we mu&s;t not avoid their Company; and to &s;hew that
we love our &s;elves, we mu&s;t &s;ometimes be alone, and take Plea&s;ure in
our &s;elves. The <HI>Italians</HI> have a very &s;ignificant Pro|verb, which
&s;ays, <HI>Mea&s;ure it a hundred Times before you cut it off</HI>; meaning
you &s;hould &s;tand upon your Guard, till you di&s;cover the Inclinations of
tho&s;e you conver&s;e with, and therefore we &s;hould be careful of laying out
our Friend&s;hip too lavi&s;hly at fir&s;t, &s;ince like other Things it will
be &s;o much the &s;ooner &s;pent: Neither &s;hould it be of too quick a
Growth, for the Plants which &s;hoot up too fa&s;t, are not of that Continuance
as tho&s;e which take more Time for it: We &s;hall &s;ee &s;ome who have hot
and cold Fits of Friend&s;hip, that &s;hall hug you one Day, and not know you
the next; this Unevenne&s;s of Temper is by all Means to be avoided in
Conver&s;ation; a good Man will always keep a &s;teddy Cour&s;e of
Friend&s;hip, which may run <PB N="71" REF="110"> like a &s;mooth Stream, and
never change, but be a perpetual Spring; for we can|not find the Gu&s;t and
Reli&s;h of a true and fixed Conver&s;ation, till we come to a great Freedom
with each other; for they that conver&s;e only as Strangers, are always under
&s;ome Re&s;traints and Unea&s;ine&s;s, and do never open them|&s;elves freely
the one to the other.</P>
<P>In the long Experience I have had in the World, I have &s;eldom, if
ever, found any Man's Company worth enjoying, that did not begin with &s;ome
Difficulty, if not Prejudice; for Conver&s;ation, like Oy&s;ters, is nothing
the better for open|ing &s;o ea&s;ie, and &s;o &s;oon. Neither is there any
more dangerous Acquaintance, than that over-ha&s;ty Familiarity contra|cted
betwixt good Fellows, as we call them in <HI>England,</HI> who u&s;ually begin
their Friend&s;hip in the Entry, and &s;trike it up in the Cellar, where
Servants are di&s;ci|plin'd to be the Mini&s;ters of their Ma|&s;ters Luxuries,
who&s;e Vices &s;eldom mi&s;s to be taken up by them, as if they were the
Badges to witne&s;s to whom they be|longed. There is no greater Mark nor
Di&s;covery of a Man, than to judge him by the Company he keeps, it being
im|po&s;&s;ible but that he &s;hall much re&s;emble them, and partake &s;ome of
their Qua|lities. <PB N="72" REF="111"> <HI>Si juxta claudum habites, &s;ub

<HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> in his Problems makes a Que&s;tion, Why Health does not

Infirmity, never his Health; the Rea&s;on is, &s;ays he, becau&s;e the Health
of the Body hath no tran&s;ient Force on others, and is per|&s;onal and not
communicative. But <HI>Mal|vezzi</HI> tell us, it is, for that Nature in
Providence drives away the Evil from it &s;elf, and thriftily re&s;erves that
which is Good; and for this Rea&s;on it is, &s;ays he, that tho&s;e who have
the Plague are de&s;irous to come into Company, that they may give it to
others; and by the &s;ame Rea&s;on, tho&s;e who have ill Qualities in them,
will be &s;ure to work and apply their Vices, like Ru&s;t, into the neare&s;t
and pure&s;t Mind.</P>
<P><HI>Edward</HI> II. of <HI>England</HI> was a &s;ad Ex|ample hereof;
for his <HI>alter idem,</HI> his great Favourite <HI>Gave&s;ton,</HI> was a Man
of <PB N="73" REF="112"> excellent Parts of Body, and of no le&s;s Endowments
of Mind, being both va|liant and witty; and if his Valour could as well have
made the King valiant, as his Riot made him riotous, there might have come
&s;ome Good of their extra|ordinary Conjunction; but &s;eeing Vir|tues are but
per&s;onal, and Vice com|municative, it made the King not on|ly more Vicious
than he would have been, but Vicious where otherwi&s;e in all Appearance he
would not have been. The Con&s;ideration of this mo&s;t mi&s;|cheivous and
dangerous Conver&s;ation, cau&s;ed <HI>Seleucus</HI> to make a Law, where|in he
forbad all Company with wicked Men. And <HI>Charondas</HI> the Lawgiver
puni&s;hed tho&s;e for wicked, who frequen|ted Lewd Company. Neither was it a
&s;ufficient An&s;wer, which <HI>Anti&s;thenes</HI> gave, when he was told of
his Conver|&s;ation with wicked Men, That Phy&s;i|cians live among&s;t the
Sick; for tho' they help &s;ick Men's Health, they &s;ure|ly impair their own,
by continual vi&s;i|ting and touching di&s;ea&s;ed Per&s;ons: But yet this
mu&s;t be favourably under|&s;tood; for there is no Rank or Quality of
Per&s;ons &s;o ab&s;olutely excluded from our Conver&s;ation, but only &s;uch a
De|gree of ill Company, as may Poi&s;on and <PB N="74" REF="113"> Corrupt the
Good; for in nearer than Company, our Friend, and in &s;ome|what nearer than
him, our &s;elves, we mu&s;t allow &s;ome Inordinaries, and ma|ny Grains of
Allowance mu&s;t be given to make the be&s;t of us Currant: There may be
likewi&s;e Occa&s;ion &s;ometimes of conver&s;ing with ill Men, not for
Socie|ty, but Bu&s;ine&s;s, and for Reformation, as our Saviour conver&s;t with
Publicans and Sinners. And therefore no Man is &s;o tied up, as to come in no
Company but good Men; for he that cannot live among&s;t the wicked, mu&s;t
&s;eek for a|nother kind of World than this, and for more perfect Creatures
than Mor|tals: It was not ill &s;aid of the Philo|&s;opher, <HI>Omnes odit qui
malos odit: He that hates ill Men hates all Men:</HI> And if a Man will love
none but hone&s;t Men, where will he find any Exerci&s;e, any Object of his
Love? If a Man will hold Friend&s;hip with none, do Offices of Society to none
but good-natur'd and &s;ociable Men, he will leave many nece&s;&s;ary
Bu&s;ine&s;&s;es undone: The fro|warde&s;t and perver&s;e&s;t Man may be good
for &s;ome particular Occa&s;ion; a crooked Piece of Timber is not thrown
a&s;ide, 'tis good for &s;ome U&s;es; the very Fle&s;h of a Viper is made an
Antidote, be|ing <PB N="75" REF="114"> mingled with other Simples and
In|gredients, and by good Company and kind U&s;age many an ill Man is better'd.
And &s;ince a Magi&s;trate cea&s;es not to be a Magi&s;trate for being an ill
Man, much le&s;s does a Man cea&s;e to be a Man, and &s;o to have Title to
tho&s;e Duties of Con|ver&s;ation and Bu&s;ine&s;s which are rooted in Nature,
becau&s;e he is of an ill Di&s;po|&s;ition. It is indeed a great Part of
Wi&s;dom to contract Friend&s;hip and In|wardne&s;s with none but good Men,
that &s;o by our Intimacy with them we may participate of their Goodne&s;s; for
Men are not like Bees, who&s;e Sweetne&s;s makes Things of another Nature
Sweet, it mu&s;t be good we receive, and then per|haps we &s;hall make it
better, but if ill, we make it wor&s;e.</P>
<P>Some Naturali&s;ts &s;ay, there is a way of Ca&s;tration in cutting
off the Ears, that there are certain Veins behind the Ears, which if cut,
cau&s;e Barrenne&s;s; our Ears are the Aqueducts of Know|ledge, and if we cut
tho&s;e, that is, in|termit our Conver&s;ation with good and wi&s;e Men, this
will prove a Ca&s;tration to our Under&s;tanding. The Advantages we receive
hereby was well intimated, in that which <HI>Socrates</HI> &s;aid to

<HI>Socrates, and I will give thee back again to thy &s;elf, better than when I
receiv'd thee:</HI> And certainly the Conver&s;ation of well-di&s;|po&s;ed Men,
who have mo&s;t look'd into the Affairs of the World, and have &s;tu|died Men
as well as Bu&s;ine&s;s, is a great Improvement of our Under&s;tanding, and
Fortifier of our Judgment, e&s;pecially if they be Men of Years, Experience,
and Virtue, and fam'd for Wi&s;dom, for their Te&s;timony is of greater Force,
and &s;ome|thing is always to be learn'd from them. For where Wi&s;dom holds
with Age, and Memory hath not unthriftily &s;pent her Comings in upon Time,
their Con|ver&s;ation is certainly the wi&s;e&s;t Book; there is only one Fault
accompanies them, their great and unwearied De&s;ire of Talking, which &s;eems
trouble&s;ome to many that hear them; yet I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s, in my younger
Days, I have ever heard &s;uch with Delight, and did at all Times mo&s;t
joyfully accept what they deliver'd, who are of all others mo&s;t a|ble to
in&s;truct Youth; and &s;urely there is much Reverence owing that Age, which
de&s;erves a fatherly Re&s;pect and Honour from us.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="116">A Gentleman in Conver&s;ation &s;hould be
Affable, not Imperious, knowing Hu|manity and Gentlene&s;s is a common Debt to

which they make u&s;e of for their own Advantage; and it is common with them,

that their De|pendance may be wholly upon them; and when &s;uch great Men die

the Fox to divide, who put all into one great Heap, and &s;et by a little
Mor&s;el for him&s;elf; and being asked by the <PB N="79" REF="118"> Lion,
<HI>How he knew &s;o wi&s;ely to divide,</HI> an&s;wer'd well, <HI>The Fortune
of my Bro|ther A&s;s hath taught me:</HI> And if I had as well under&s;tood the
Moral of this Fable when I learnt it at School, as I did afterwards by
dear-bought Experience, I had not &s;tood &s;o long in the A&s;s's Place; but
<HI>&s;ero &s;apiunt Phryges.</HI></P>
<P>Now there are &s;ome Men &s;o far from this Humour, that they always
keep Company with mean Per&s;ons, and tho&s;e below them; whereas there can be
no true Friend&s;hip, but betwixt Equals: And therefore wi&s;e Men will not
only avoid conver&s;ing with &s;uch who are much Superior, but al&s;o with
tho&s;e who are much Inferior, not only in Degree, but in Parts, for <HI>tanti
eris aliis quanti tibi fueris</HI>; and that our Thoughts and De&s;igns will be
&s;uch as our Companions are, and low Fortunes breed many times degenerous
Purpo&s;es, and he that makes him&s;elf an A&s;s, invites others to ride him;
and it is a very mean Ambition to be the be&s;t in the Company, it be|ing an
experienced Truth, That he who de&s;ires always to be the be&s;t Man in the
Company he keeps, &s;hall &s;oon be|come the wor&s;t of any Company he comes
into.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="119">And yet this Conver&s;ation, tho' bad, is not
&s;o dangerous as keeping Company with Fools, Folly being no good Tutor to
teach Wi&s;dom; neither can a wi&s;e Man contract Friend&s;hip with a Fool,
their Qualities being &s;o far different: For when any Man is taken with
ano|ther's Conver&s;ation, it is a great Argu|ment that they are both of the
&s;ame Sen|timents, but a Fool &s;erves for nothing, but &s;ometimes to divert
an ingenious Man, and no other u&s;e can be made of him.</P>
<P>But tho&s;e who love Multitudes are in wor&s;e Danger than in
keeping Company with Fools; for &s;uch live in a Crowd, and a Herd is not
Company; the very &s;mell of them offends a wi&s;e Man, and where the Crowd of
Men is, there is the Crowd of ill Cu&s;toms; and &s;ince 'tis hard to avoid
Temptations when they come &s;ingle, How &s;hall we e&s;cape them when they
come upon us in a full Body? How can we think of any thing but Ill, when we
&s;ee nothing that's Good? Young Gentlemen who are newly come into the World
with great Fortunes and ill Breeding, &s;eek great Meetings, and Sin for
Company to gain Experience. And therefore 'tis no wonder they are entangled in
Debts, and made a Prey <PB N="81" REF="120"> to Cheaters, and embroiled in
Quar|rels, &s;o long as they frequent &s;uch Con|ver&s;ation. It was in &s;uch
kind of Com|pany I conceive <HI>Seneca</HI> meant, when he &s;aid, <HI>He never
went among&s;t Men but he came home a wor&s;e Man that he went out.</HI></P>
<P>Among&s;t wi&s;e Men, the principal End of Company is Conference,
and Con|ference to be better'd by is not u&s;ually met with in Crowds, where
Men meet not like Bees to make Honey, but like Wa&s;ps, who love to feed in
Dung; in &s;uch Company you &s;hall hear Men &s;peak neither hone&s;tly nor
temperately, Slan|der or Flattery ingro&s;&s;ing all their Di&s;|cour&s;e, &s;o
that no Man can be better'd by their Conver&s;ation, the chattering of Magpyes
being better Mu&s;ick than a Con&s;ort of &s;uch &s;en&s;ele&s;s Per&s;ons;
nay, a De&s;art is to be preferr'd before &s;uch de|bauch'd Companions, for the
wildne&s;s of the Place is but unchearful, whil&s;t the wildne&s;s of Lewd
Per&s;ons is infe|ctious.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, there is another Con|ver&s;ation, which is that
of Women; and tho' young Gentlemen are general|ly pleas'd to think this a very
innocent Diver&s;ion, yet none is more dangerous, e&s;|pecially as to the
Woman's Part, and proves <PB N="82" REF="121"> often a more pernicious Calamity
than that which thru&s;ts Men into Ho&s;pitals; Such Men as &s;pend their whole
Time, like <HI>Sardanapalus,</HI> among&s;t Women, and yet pretend Cha&s;tity,
are ridiculous.</P>
<P>If the&s;e hear of a beautiful Woman, what Contrivances and
De&s;igns do they lay fir&s;t to &s;ee her, and then to corrupt her, and make
it their great Bu&s;ine&s;s, as well as Trade, for their Agents and Factors to
&s;pring &s;uch Game; and upon the&s;e Occa&s;ions, tho&s;e will liberally
Sa|crifice all their Time, of which, when any charitable Office would borrow
from them &s;ome Minutes, they are then &s;uch bu&s;ie Per&s;ons, they can by
no Means afford it; but to go in que&s;t of &s;uch Game, to have the Company of
Women is their only Delight and Pa&s;time: But Ladies mu&s;t take heed of
&s;uch dange|rous Conver&s;ation; and e&s;pecially by how much the more lively
they are, they are the more liable to be hurt, as the fine&s;t Plants are the
&s;oone&s;t Nipt by the Fro&s;t.</P>
<P>The World is a dangerous Stage for Women, where Virtue alone will
not defend them, unle&s;s join'd with much Prudence; they mu&s;t have both for
their Guard, and not &s;tir without them, and all little enough, for the Enemy
being <PB N="83" REF="122"> abroad, they are &s;ure to be taken if they be
&s;traggling. Their Behaviour there|fore mu&s;t ever incline &s;trongly towards
the re&s;erved Part, the deceitfulne&s;s of the Age we live in having made this
Caution highly nece&s;&s;ary: For tho' mo&s;t Men &s;eem indeed Plantonick
Lovers, and &s;o at fir&s;t as humble Gallants they are only admitted for
Trophies, yet they very often become Conquerors, and from Admirers grow into
Ma&s;ters. Be&s;ides, the World is not &s;o great a Fool, as not very well to
know, that frequent Vi&s;its made to hand&s;om Wo|men &s;oon grow Su&s;picious,
&s;ince we know all Men are pleas'd with what is Hand&s;ome: <HI>Stimulus
carnis,</HI> is a na|tural Vice in all Men, and Lu&s;t is no way better
re&s;train'd, than by keeping far from &s;uch Creatures.</P>
<P>He that will avoid committing Sin, mu&s;t &s;hun the Occa&s;ions;
for the be&s;t Philo&s;opher cannot make me believe, but that every Man
naturally is pleas'd with a &s;avory Mor&s;el: And they that make
Profe&s;&s;ion of not &s;taining their Reputa|tion with Spots of Uncleanne&s;s,
ought to &s;hun all that allures thereunto; for it is not only a great Peice of
Folly, but an infinite Ra&s;hne&s;s worthy to be puni&s;hed, to make Gun-Powder
in a <PB N="84" REF="123"> Smith's Shop, with Hopes to make People believe
there is no Danger in it.</P>
<P>Some learned Phy&s;icians affirm, and Anatomi&s;ts do al&s;o tell
us, When a Wo|man bears Twins, if they be both of the &s;ame Sex, they are
enwrapped in one Film, but if of different, wi&s;e Nature parts them; And if
Nature thinks not fit to lodge a Brother and Si&s;ter toge|ther in &s;o tender
an Age, this certainly teaches us, that Per&s;ons of different Sexes cannot
live &s;afely together; and tho&s;e who relie upon their Strength and Vir|tue,
in &s;uch Occa&s;ions, are certainly more Ra&s;h than Wi&s;e: And tho&s;e young
Ladies who promi&s;e to them&s;elves ne|ver to go &s;o far, as to be gain'd,
nor to admit any but indifferent Favours, &s;uch as Civility allows; and after
having gi|ven Way to more than they &s;hould, they find a Precipice, where they
expected only Entertainment: And that Woman who will allow her &s;elf to go to
the ut|mo&s;t Extremity of every Thing that is Lawful, is &s;o very near going
farther, that tho&s;e Gentlemen who lie at Watch, will begin to Count upon her:
For Men are apt to turn every Thing that a Wo|man does to the hopeful Side; But
yet few are &s;o Impudent as to make an <PB N="85" REF="124"> Application, till
they &s;ee &s;omething which they are willing to take for an Encouragement.</P>
<P>And therefore it is much more honou|rable and &s;afer for Women to
prevent &s;uch Forwardne&s;s, than to go about to cure it; nothing being with
more Care to be avoided by them, than &s;uch a kind of Civility, which may be
mi&s;taken for an Invitation</P>
<P>I wi&s;h many imprudent Ladies had not found the Truth of this, Men
often &s;tealing from little Favours to greater, and &s;till carry on their
De&s;igns, till ma|ny Times they change their Intreaties into Threats, and
their Softne&s;s into Violence; and then tho&s;e Women find too late, that true
Simplicity is abu&s;ed, when it deals with fal&s;ifyed; the fear of lo&s;ing
their Reputation, after having given &s;ome Advantages which they ought not to
have done, hath debauched ma|ny Women, and therefore they ought to be very
cautious what Men they ad|mit into their Company, and of gran|ting the lea&s;t
Civilities. For as the Sun &s;hining upon a Looking-Gla&s;s melting the
Quick&s;ilver, pre&s;ently cau&s;es Spots; &s;o if a young Gentleman do but
look upon a beautiful Woman, a Flame of Love pre&s;ently ari&s;es: The ancient
Phi|lo&s;ophers <PB N="86" REF="125"> knew this well, which made them
pre&s;cribe Ab&s;ence for the Reme|dy of Love, that Men &s;hould not &s;ee
their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es: But &s;he knew it bet|ter, who &s;aid to her Lover,
<HI>Di&s;cede, di&s;cede, a foculo meo, nam &s;i te vel mi|nim&egrave;,
igniculus meus afflaverit, ureris infim&eacute;.</HI> And what
<HI>Propertius</HI> &s;ays is mo&s;t true: 
<Q> 
<L>Cre&s;cit enim a&s;&s;idu&egrave; &s;pectando cura puellae,</L> 
<L>Ip&s;e alimenta &s;ibi maxima praebet amor.</L></Q></P>
<P>In the la&s;t Place, there are &s;ome Con|ver&s;ations which are
neither good nor bad, profitable for nothing, but only Recreation, Men who
&s;eem as it were made for no other Purpo&s;e but to divert from &s;erious
Affairs: And &s;ince even Saints them&s;elves have had their Diver|ti&s;ements,
and that all Per&s;ons are al|low'd &s;ome Breathing-time of humane Delight, we
may therefore &s;afely &s;pare the&s;e Men that Lei&s;ure, which is &s;et
a|part for our Conver&s;ation, and &s;ome|times lend our &s;elves to them, that
we may be the better enabled to return to our &s;erious Employments.</P>

<HEAD>Of Solitarine&s;s and Retirement.</HEAD>
<P>_THERE is nothing &s;o Pre|judicial to Action, as to be always in
Action; for the Mind, like the Body, is tired, by being always in one
Po&s;ture, to be too &s;erious breaks it, to be too diverting loo&s;ens it;
&s;o that to unbend our Thoughts, when they are too much &s;tretched by our
Cares, is not more natural than nece&s;&s;ary. The Eye &s;ees not the Objects
touching it, but tho&s;e only remote, and the Under&s;tan|ding continually
plunged in Affairs, is not &s;o quick and piercing, as his, who &s;ometimes
retires from Publick Employ|ments: Experience teaches us, that the Eye having
lo&s;t its quickne&s;s by much looking upon the Light, recovers its vigour
again in the Dark; and as the mo&s;t curious Gravers are obliged to look
&s;ometimes upon green Flies, to recollect again their &s;catter'd Sight; &s;o
the Spi|rit, being weakned and di&s;tracted with variety of Affairs, ought to
recover its Force in the Privacy of &s;ome &s;mall Re|treat. 
<PB N="88" REF="127"> In the Heat and Tumult of Bu|&s;ine&s;s, Rea&s;on hath
not Power to give Conduct to active Life, Man having but an imperfect
Under&s;tanding without Me|ditation, and therefore as Bees mu&s;t retire to the
Honey, after they have gather'd the Matter from Flowers; &s;o it is
nece&s;&s;ary, that we retire into our Selves, to gather the Fruit of our
Ex|perience, otherwi&s;e we &s;hall be but ill Husbands of the Wealth we have
got|ten.</P>
<P>Indeed, the Fruit we gather from our many Days of Company is very
little, we &s;catter much in Conver&s;ation, we gather but &s;mall Profit; but
for the few Hours we &s;pend in Retirement and Re|collection the Return is very
con&s;idera|ble, and the greater Portions of our Time we lay out this way, the
more Trea&s;ure we lay up for our Selves here|after. This inward
Con&s;ideration is a large and powerful Study, to &s;uch as can &s;eriou&s;ly
Ta&s;te and Employ them|&s;elves therein. It is the Nouri&s;hment and Life of
our Spirit, and Nature hath favour'd it with this &s;ingular Privilege, that
there is nothing we can do &s;o long, neither is there any thing more ea&s;ie,
more natural, or more our own, than to meditate and entertain our Thoughts.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="128">Thus, as often as the Mind (inter|rupted in its
Operation by external Ob|jects) would have the Body to be &s;till and quiet, it
pre&s;ently betakes it &s;elf to Retirement, when neither Wife nor Children,
Kindred nor Bu&s;ine&s;s, nor what&s;oever el&s;e can make any Trouble, are to
be &s;een, all Things being exclu|ded that can di&s;turb: But &s;ince this
&s;o|litary Employment and Entertainment of our Selves, is either one of the
be&s;t or the wor&s;t Things we can undertake; it mu&s;t not therefore be in
Vanity, much le&s;s in any Thing that is Vicious, but in Study, in profound
Knowledge, and in the diligent Culture of our Minds.</P>
<P>He that will withdraw him&s;elf, mu&s;t fir&s;t prepare to receive
him&s;elf: It is not Wi&s;dom to let the Spleen govern us, to over-drive Nature
is to draw a Blemi&s;h upon our Judgment; Men that retire &s;hould fir&s;t
examine the Difficulty of the Enterprize, for without this preliminary
Prudence, a Man may over-burthen his Shoulders, and &s;oon wade out of Depth.
And tho' Solitude promi&s;es fair, and is a &s;trong Engagement to a retired
Per&s;on, yet it is to many better in Pro&s;pect than in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: It
is a great Folly to tru&s;t our &s;elves if we cannot govern our &s;elves, and
he had need be very well a&s;&s;ur'd of <PB N="90" REF="129"> him&s;elf, that
falls into his own Hands, for it often happens, that none are more dangerous
than our own; and therefore wi&s;ely &s;ays the <HI>Spaniard, God keep me from
my &s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>That Man is much mi&s;taken, who thinks Solitude a Sanctuary
again&s;t all Vices: It is good again&s;t &s;uch as pro|ceed from without us,
but it hath its inward and &s;piritual Difficulties. And tho' the Devil be
bu&s;ie in all Places, yet he takes Solitude to be his Ground of Advantage,
from whence oft-times he plays his Batteries with mo&s;t Succe&s;s. Thus we
&s;ee he ventur'd to attack our Saviour him&s;elf, when he found him in the
Wilderne&s;s, to &s;hew it is mo&s;t dan|gerous for tho&s;e to be alone that
are not Ma&s;ters of them&s;elves; there being no Security from Danger by
running away from the World, e&s;pecially if Melan|choly drives us to Solitude,
which makes the Mind unea&s;ie, and ill Thoughts are no Foreign Commodity, but
purely of our own Growth, which are mo&s;t dan|gerous in Solitude; for many
Men, who have well pre&s;erv'd them&s;elves in Com|pany, have been lo&s;t in
Solitude. <HI>Lot</HI> was Cha&s;te even in the City of <HI>Sodom,</HI> yet
defiled in his Cave. To an Impru|dent unadvi&s;ed Man Solitude is a dan|gerous 
<PB N="91" REF="130"> Staff; and it's to be fear'd, that whil&s;t he Walks
alone, he entertains more and wor&s;e Company than him&s;elf, Mens Vices many
times giving them the Ta&s;te of Solitude, making them &s;o much &s;hun Company
and &s;eek the more Elbow-Room. For a Man may as well fail a|lone as in
Company, there are ways for it, until &s;uch time that he hath fram'd him&s;elf
&s;uch, as to become <HI>Sibi Thea|trum,</HI> that he &s;o much re&s;pects his
Rea|&s;on and fears his Con&s;cience, that he cannot without Shame &s;tumble or
trip in their Pre&s;ence, that he dare not halt before him&s;elf, but bears a
kind of Re|verence and Re&s;pect unto him&s;elf, which next to Religion is the
chiefe&s;t Bridle again&s;t all Vice. <HI>Cicero</HI> in this Ca&s;e gives an
excellent Direction, <HI>Ob&s;erven|tur &s;pecies hone&s;tae animo: Let
hone&s;t Ideas &s;till repre&s;ent them&s;elves before our Mind. Let us,</HI>
&s;ays <HI>Seneca, repre|&s;ent</HI> Cato, Phocion, <HI>and</HI> Ari&s;tides,
<HI>to our Imagination,</HI> (in who&s;e Pre&s;ence even Fools would hide their
Faults) <HI>and e&s;tabli&s;h them as Comptrollers of all our Actions.</HI></P>
<P>It is certainly a rare Thing, <HI>&V;t &s;atis &s;e qui&s;que
vereatur; That every Man &s;hould &s;ufficiently &s;tand in Awe of
him|&s;elf:</HI> We &s;hould win &s;o much upon our <PB N="92" REF="131">
&s;elves, as to be able in good Earne&s;t, and willingly to be left alone, to
quit the World if need be, to dwell and de|light in our &s;elves: We mu&s;t
break tho&s;e Bonds a&s;under that fa&s;ten and bind us to each other; and not
&s;o tie our &s;elves to the Things of this World, that our Felicity depend
upon them, but re&s;erve a Store-hou&s;e for our &s;elves, (what need &s;oever
happen) wherein we may &s;ecure and e&s;tabli&s;h our true Contentment and
principal Retreat. This Store-hou&s;e is a wi&s;e Man's Mind, which moves and
turns within it &s;elf, and is well conten|ted to keep it &s;elf Company, and
en|joy it &s;elf: And when the World frowns upon us, and that we are barren of
Em|ployments, we ought then to betake our &s;elves to the &s;ecret Improver of
Minds, Contemplation, thereby adorn|ing our Hou&s;e within, and make it rea|dy,
if for Gue&s;ts that is for Bu&s;ine&s;s, and if they come not, 'tis no matter,
it will be the better for us to live in. Thus we mu&s;t bring home our
Cogita|tions to our &s;elves, that our Contentment may depend upon what is
within us, nei|ther &s;eeking nor di&s;daining Employ|ment, but cheerfully go
on either with or without it, with a calm and undi|&s;turbed Mind. For this
World is a <PB N="93" REF="132"> Comedy, where every Man acts that Part which
Providence hath a&s;&s;igned him; and as it is e&s;teemed more Noble to look on
than to act, &s;o there is no &s;ecurer Box from which to behold it, than a
&s;afe Retreat, it being ea&s;ier to feel than expre&s;s the Plea&s;ure that
may be taken in &s;tanding aloof off, and in contemplating the Reelings of the
Mul|titude upon the Stage of this World.</P>
<P>There is no Coun&s;el more proper for Men than the Philo&s;opher's,
<HI>Tecum ha|bite,</HI> to dwell at Home, and not to &s;uf|fer any Thing to
&s;teal us away from our &s;elves; there is neither Profit nor Plea|&s;ure
worth &s;o much, that we &s;hould go abroad to &s;eek it. Even among&s;t
<HI>Pagans</HI> the wi&s;e&s;t look'd upon the Things of this World as Lumber
rather than Furniture, as Things which they needed not, and retired within
their own Brea&s;ts, which they call'd their Home, there to enjoy Virtue their
only Good: And many of the <HI>Epicurean</HI> Sect (who propos'd to
them&s;elves no other End but their own Contentment) did bereave them&s;elves
of all &s;en&s;ual Delights, and contemn'd the Glory and Pomp of all worldly
Wealth and Greatne&s;s, for the only Plea&s;ure of Contemplation. But now a
wi&s;e Chri|&s;tian, that may within his own Brea&s;t <PB N="94" REF="133">
enjoy both Virtue and God him&s;elf, hath much higher Advantages, and more
Rea&s;on to keep within that Home, and to look upon Things without with an
indifferent Eye. That Man therefore forgets his Origin and his Dignity, that
puts his Soul out of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her &s;elf, by running perpetually
after Hopes that fly from him; whereas he &s;hould aban|don the Plea&s;ures of
this Life, and bid adieu to all manner of Vanities, &s;hun|ning all
Pa&s;&s;ions that may any way im|peach the Tranquility either of Mind or Body,
making God the only Object of his Contemplation: He that thus re|tires, draws
no Man's Envy upon him, he reigns by him&s;elf, and all the Pomp which
Greatne&s;s draws after it, is not compa|rable to that which he enjoys in
Secret; for as that Man mu&s;t needs be accounted mo&s;t Happy, that is
like&s;t unto God; &s;o Man's chiefe&s;t Happine&s;s mu&s;t needs con|&s;i&s;t
in the Contemplation of his Divine Maje&s;ty and of his Works. And indeed,
nothing but the Supports of Religion, and a Spiritual Retreat, upon that &s;ole
Account, can make a Man fit to enter|tain him&s;elf, withdrawing upon the Score
of Religion. Thus to &s;hut up the Pro|&s;pect of this World, that we may take
the better View of the other, is a pru|dent <PB N="95" REF="134"> Precaution:
Thus we untwi&s;t our Affections, and &s;lide off from the World, before the
World &s;lips from us; thus to retire is the be&s;t Improvement of Soli|tude,
and to be thus Alone is the way to bring us to the mo&s;t de&s;ireable
Com|pany.</P>
<P>To Retire for Quiet and Thinking is commendable, <HI>Amici fures
Temporis,</HI> &s;ays the Lord <HI>Bacon.</HI> Conver&s;ation is a Thief that
&s;teals away a great Part of our Time, and u&s;ually &s;tuffs our Me|mory with
Rubbi&s;h; Solitude is a great Relief in &s;uch Ca&s;es, and wi&s;e Men are
glad to get clear of the Crowd for fre&s;h Air and Breathing. It is not Noi&s;e
and Fla&s;hes, Thunder and Lightning, that make fair Days, but it is the Sun's
ca&s;t|ing a clear and plea&s;ing Light, with gen|tle Gales; &s;o a Life led in
&s;weet Tran|quillity (which is the work of Rea&s;on) is much preferable before
all the great Succe&s;&s;es which the World admires, and which are nothing but
the Extravagan|cies of Fortune: In Retirement, we ta&s;te the Sweet of a quiet
Repo&s;e, and enter|tain our &s;elves with Freedom; nay, we live more in two
Days of Retreat, and we are more &s;en&s;ible of what Life is, than in two
Years full of Bu&s;ine&s;s and Trouble, and we &s;ee greater Things in 
<PB N="96" REF="135"> Retirement than abroad in the World: For what do we &s;ee
great in the World, unle&s;s it be perhaps an Army, the Siege of a Town, or the
Court of a Prince? We are quickly accu&s;tom'd to the&s;e, which only appear
great to us at the fir&s;t Sight. But in Retirement, we look up|on the
different Works of Nature, the Sun ri&s;ing and &s;etting, a &s;till Night, and
tho&s;e Planets which &s;o maje&s;tically Roul over our Heads, which we
continually ad|mire. It is ob&s;erv'd by learned Phy&s;i|cians, that tho&s;e
who dwell farthe&s;t from the Sun, (if in any convenient Di&s;tance) have
longer Life, better Appetites, Di|ge&s;tion and Growth, than others who dwell
not &s;o remote from the Heats thereof; Such Advantages, and much greater, have
their Minds, who are well removed from the Scorchings, the Daz|zlings and
Exhalings of the World's Glory, into a private Retirement: Whereas tho&s;e who
live in the Throng of Bu&s;ine&s;s and Company, their Minds lo&s;e their Re&s;t
and Tranquility, and many times after a Man hath lo&s;t his Re&s;t, he lo&s;eth
his Labour al&s;o.</P>
<P>It is a great Mi&s;ery for a Man never to be his own; too much
Acquaintance makes us Strangers to our &s;elves; the more we conver&s;e with
Men, the le&s;s <PB N="97" REF="136"> we conver&s;e with God, and the Con|tent
which we may expect by our Con|ver&s;ation with Men, is lo&s;t by too much
Conver&s;ation. I know Society is one of tho&s;e Satisfactions which are
reckon'd among&s;t the Plea&s;ures of the fir&s;t Mag|nitude in this Life; but
when we con|&s;ider that the Advantage of Society con|&s;i&s;ts not in &s;eeing
each other, but in rational Conver&s;ation, it will appear, that Solitude is
much more Satisfactory; for what Plea&s;ure can be receiv'd in talking of new
Fa&s;hions, of great Pur|cha&s;es, of Advancement or Ruin of Favourites,
Victories, or Defeats of &s;tranger Princes and Armies, &s;ome of which are the
u&s;ual Subject of ordinary Conver&s;ation; and in Courts and great Cities, Men
neither &s;eek nor find any other Diverti&s;ement, than vi&s;iting each other,
reviewing their Habits, talking of new Fa&s;hions, or of the Weather, or &s;ome
&s;uch pitiful Stuffs; and if Men di&s;cour&s;e upon more &s;erious Subjects,
they are &s;ure to be contradicted, which often cau&s;es Quarrels. Be&s;ides,
in the&s;e Rencoun|ters, Men are tempted to betray their Ignorance, or their
Malice, in either of which they are e&s;teem'd Blockheads or Quarrel&s;om: And
if we conver&s;e with tho&s;e who &s;peak with more Addre&s;s than 
<PB N="98" REF="137"> our &s;elves, we repine at our own Dul|ne&s;s, and envy
their Acutene&s;s; and if we conver&s;e with Duller than our &s;elves, we are
&s;oon weary, and fret at our be|ing in ill Company: And if by chance we
accompany our Equals, then we are upon our Guard, to catch all Ad|vantages,
that we may be thought more knowing; and we are &s;o intere&s;ted in this Point
of Honour, that &s;uch Conver|&s;ation rather vexes than recreates, and many
Per&s;ons make them&s;elves cheap upon the&s;e Occa&s;ions, whom we had highly
valued if we had frequented them le&s;s.</P>
<P>That Man who dwells upon him&s;elf, and is always conver&s;ant with
him&s;elf, re&s;ts in his true and proper Center; and therefore he that hath
learnt Wi&s;dom from the Folly of others, and the Mi&s;|carriages of his own
Actions, will be content to &s;ee the Crowd afar off, and not any more thru&s;t
into it, but retire within him&s;elf: It is true indeed, there is no Place but
there are means in it to do Well or Ill; a Man may live a|lone in the Throng of
a Palace, but if he may chu&s;e he will avoid the Sight of it: If need require,
he will endure the Court, but if he may have his Li|berty, he will be alone;
for Contagion <PB N="99" REF="138"> is catching in a Throng, and a Man mu&s;t
either imitate the Vicious or hate them, and both are dangerous: He that is
care|ful to avoid Occa&s;ions, &s;tarves his Sin; tho&s;e are rare Men that can
live in the mid&s;t of Temptations and not fall: <HI>Ne|mo diu tutus periculo
proximus, &amp; quae licita, &s;unt ritanda, propter vicinitatem
illiciti.</HI></P>
<P>We have never greater Cau&s;e to con|&s;ult our be&s;t Wits, what we
are to do, and how we are to carry our &s;elves, than when Preferment or
Publick Employ|ments are offered us. It was no idle Que|&s;tion asked by an
eminent Man, Whe|ther if great Places or Employments were offered us, we
&s;hould refu&s;e or ad|mit them? wherein the divers Abilities of Men are to be
con&s;idered: He that hath Strength and Wi&s;dom to manage &s;uch Places may
receive them; but he that would live quietly ought not to en|tangle him&s;elf
with more than he can manage; let him try, <HI>Quid ferre recu|&s;ent, quid
valeant humeri</HI>; the &s;trong and virtuous Man may po&s;&s;ibly meet and
encounter Temptations with Advantage, which the more cautelous will avoid; and
in one of the&s;e two Ranks every good Man is found; and we may well compare
them to <HI>Hannibal</HI> and <HI>Fabius,</HI> <PB N="100" REF="139"> the
fir&s;t always calling for Battle, the other evermore declining it.</P>
<P>There are indeed &s;everal Degrees of Solitude, and tho&s;e wi&s;ely
retire, who being harra&s;&s;ed with the Fatigues of a Publick Life,
fore&s;eeing ill Weather, are willing to put into Port, when keeping out at Sea
might endanger the Ve&s;&s;el: When the Winds go cro&s;s, 'tis Pru|dence to
furl the Sails: Thus that great Prince <HI>Charles</HI> V. when he found his
Succe&s;s began to fail him, he pre&s;ent|ly withdrew.</P>
<P>To be able to check our Enemy, to encounter Occa&s;ions, to act our
Part upon the common Stage of this Life, and yet to keep our &s;elves Upright,
this is indeed truly to live; but to avoid Oc|ca&s;ions, to overcome the World
by re|tiring from it, argues a wi&s;e, tho' in the World's Opinion, a weak and
faint|ing Spirit, who think there is no greater Argument of Imperfection in a
good Man, <HI>Qu&agrave;m non po&s;&s;e pati &s;olem, non multitudinem,</HI>
not to be able to appear in Publick without Offence, and who can only live to
God and him&s;elf, <HI>&V;tilis ip&s;e &s;ibi, forta&s;&s;is inutilis
orbi:</HI> Tho' this indeed be the weaker Side, yet certainly it is the
&s;afer, rather than by an improvident Fool-hardine&s;s, to 
<PB N="101" REF="140"> thru&s;t our &s;elves upon Occa&s;ions, which we are
unable to manage without Of|fence.</P>
<P>There is not among&s;t Men a greater or more frequent Error
committed than in this Kind; for in mo&s;t Things of this World, Men that have
no Skill in them, will be content to acknowledge their Ignorance, to give Place
to better Ex|perience, and will advi&s;e and con&s;ult with every one in their
proper My&s;tery; but let Offer be made of Places of Ho|nour, Money or
Preferment, no Man will excu&s;e him&s;elf, or acknowledge his Ignorance or
Weakne&s;s to manage them; whereas our Errors are no where &s;o dan|gerous, as
in the unskillful managing of the&s;e Things; and therefore it is better to be
cautious and wary, than &s;trong and hardy: <HI>Malo cautior e&s;&s;e quam
fortior, fortis &s;aepe captus e&s;t, cautus rari&s;&s;im&egrave;:</HI> We read
in Holy Scripture of a Race of Men &s;o much greater in Bulk than or|dinary,
that Men of common Size &s;eem'd but as Gra&s;hoppers to them; yet we find the
little Men were always too hard for them, and drove them out; becau&s;e the
Gyants depended upon the Opinion of their Strength and Hardine&s;s, the others
upon their wary Wit and Policy; and it commonly happens &s;o in this World, 
<PB N="102" REF="141"> and we &s;hall find that far more have pe|ri&s;hed by
unadvi&s;edly venturing upon the Things of this World, than by &s;ober and
di&s;creet Retiring.</P>
<P>But many Men over-rate them&s;elves, who&s;e Expectations being
great, when they are not care&s;s'd and humour'd in their Folly, they
pre&s;ently grow chagrin and &s;ick of the World, and fall into a Fit of
Retirement and Melancholy, and will keep no longer Company with any. The&s;e
Men, like Children when cro&s;|&s;ed, grow &s;ullen in a Corner; but he that
thus &s;huns Company and retreats, re|tires only like a Bea&s;t to his Den.</P>
<P>We have &s;een many Examples, where Greatne&s;s hath ruin'd
&s;everal Per&s;ons, who liv'd with much Honour and Re|putation before.
<HI>Nero, Tiberius,</HI> and &s;ome others, enjoy'd the Repute of No|ble Souls
before their mounting the Im|perial Throne, which brought them new Vices with
their Honours, and made them as much &s;urpa&s;s others in their Debauches, as
they did in their Power; &s;o that Publick Employment is &s;carce to be
wi&s;hed for, &s;eeing Men are tempted thereby to commit the greate&s;t Crimes.
<HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> who was the Meeke&s;t of Men, whil&s;t he lived in the
Wilderne&s;s; yet when Providence advanced him, he &s;o <PB N="103" REF="142">
highly offended God, that all his for|mer Services could not obtain the
Li|berty of his entring into the Land of <HI>Canaan.</HI></P>
<P>And tho' at the Creation God found it not good for Man to be alone,
and there|fore gave him a Companion; yet to &s;hew the Hazard of being in
Company, even <HI>Adam</HI> could not live one Day in it, and be Innocent; for
the fir&s;t News we hear of him after <HI>Eve</HI> was a&s;&s;ociate with him,
is, That he had forfeited his Native Purity.</P>
<P>When God intended to conver&s;e with <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> he call'd him
from the populous Camp to the Top of Mount <HI>Sinai</HI>; and Chri&s;t did not
di&s;clo&s;e the Glories of his Transfiguration at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> but on
the Top of the Mount of <HI>Olives:</HI> When God did di&s;cipline his beloved,
yet rebellious People of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> he cho&s;e fir&s;t the
Wilderne&s;s, then the two Cap|tivities to be his School.</P>
<P>Hi&s;tory tells us of many, who out of their Skill and Strength have
given free Entertainment to the World, and have made large u&s;e of it, in all
ways of Greatne&s;s and Expence, when their Time and Hour came, would rather
have gone out of &s;ome poor Cottage, than out of a Princely Palace, and lived
with no <PB N="104" REF="143"> Noi&s;e in the World, that &s;o they might have
died in Peace: <HI>Charles</HI> V. the Prince of <HI>Parma,</HI> and &s;undry
others, tho' they liv'd in all Pomp and State, yet at their Death they
de&s;ired to be buried in a Capuchin's Habit; and if they thought, to die in a
State of perfect Se|que&s;tration from the World was &s;o pre|cious, how much
more available had it been to live in it? For thus to die, not having thus
liv'd, is nothing el&s;e but to give Sentence again&s;t their own Life; for we
&s;hall not appear before God as we died, but as we liv'd; to profe&s;s
De&s;ertion of the World at one's Death, as mo&s;t do, is only to be buried in
a Capuchin's Hood.</P>
<P>It was a notable An&s;wer given by the Philo&s;opher to
<HI>Pyrrhus,</HI> who when he told him, <HI>He would Conquer</HI> Greece,
<HI>then</HI> Rome, <HI>and &s;o all the World: Cy|neas</HI> ask'd him, <HI>Why
he would give him|&s;elf &s;o much Trouble</HI>; to which <HI>Pyr|rhus</HI>
an&s;wer'd, <HI>He would do it, that he might afterwards live happily and
mer|rily with his Friends</HI>; but <HI>Cyneas</HI> re|ply'd &s;harply, <HI>He
might live &s;o pre|&s;ently, and not take &s;o much Pains for it.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="144">Men that are &s;till bu&s;ied in Publick
Affairs, who&s;e Mercurial Genius inclines them to a re&s;tle&s;s Life, they
(like <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> on <HI>Pi&s;gah</HI>) &s;ee Retirement, their Land of
<HI>Canaan</HI> afar off, but without Hopes of Enjoyment: And we have &s;een
&s;ome great Men, who would never leave Em|ployments till outed of them, like
Whales and other great Fi&s;hes that never come on Shoar till they are wounded,
and then the&s;e Men have prais'd Retirement, not to &s;atisfie their Rea&s;on,
but their Re|venge; yet even this Proceeding of theirs commends Retirement,
&s;ince even the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed expect a Protection there, for Di&s;tre&s;s
makes Men run where they may expect Help: And certainly tho&s;e, who after
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing great Places in Courts, have been unexpectedly di&s;gra|ced,
will be more really convinced of its Slipperine&s;s, than &s;uch as never found
the Effects of &s;o much Revolution: Nay, tho&s;e Men who &s;eek greedily after
Pub|lick Employments, pretend thereby a De&s;ign for Solitude. Thus Merchants
&s;eek about the World, that they may gain &s;o much as may afford them the
Conve|niency of a Retirement: And Soldiers have often nothing to &s;weeten
their An|xieties, but the remote Pro&s;pect of &s;ome good Garri&s;on for a
Retreat. And <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> <PB N="106" REF="145"> him&s;elf &s;aid,
<HI>Aliquando mihi licebit mi|hi vivere, He would have his &s;pare Hours,</HI>
e&s;teeming that Part of his Life to be|long to others, which was &s;pent on
other Men's Employments.</P>
<P>Now the wonder is, that the &s;ame Im|pul&s;e which hurries Men to
de&s;ire to be Great that they may be Ma&s;ters, &s;hould not with far more
Rea&s;on carry them to be Solitary, where they are free from tho&s;e
Nece&s;&s;ities, and have none to obey but God and Nature, Ma&s;ters who
command us nothing but what were fit for us to do, tho' we were not
com|manded.</P>
<P>This Con&s;ideration hath made many Holy Fathers retire into
De&s;arts (where they &s;carce had any other Nouri&s;hment but their own Juice,
nor any other Com|pany but God) that they might tend the Work of their
Salvation without Di|&s;turbance: There they did as it were de&s;cend into
their Sepulchers by deep and holy Meditation; and from tho&s;e Hermitages
inriched the Trea&s;ure of the Church, with their Divine Works con|futing
Gain-&s;ayers, and increa&s;ing the Stock of Holy Learning.</P>
<P>But it hath not been unu&s;ual for &s;ome Men to retire from the
World, and yet look back at it, as <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife at <HI>Sodom,</HI> 
<PB N="107" REF="146"> and oftentimes to keep their Hearts in it: Thus did many
of the Philo&s;ophers who left the World in Effect, but not in Affection; for
in their Retirements they had nothing but their Arms and Legs out of the
Throng, their Minds and Intents were &s;till engaged, and they only went back
that they might leap the better, and with a &s;tronger Motion make a nimbler
Offer again into the World: The&s;e Men did not take the right way, they
thought they had total|ly taken leave of all Bu&s;ine&s;s, that they might live
at more Lei&s;ure and greater Ea&s;e; but they mi&s;took them&s;elves, and only
exchanged one Employment for another; for tho' they had &s;haken off the Court
and Publick Employments, they had not taken leave of the principal Vexations of
Life, nor had di&s;charged them&s;elves nor their Minds of the Bur|thens which
oppre&s;&s;ed them; they had not &s;o ordered it, that their Contentment
de|pended wholly upon them&s;elves, and that they could live alone in good
earne&s;t, and at Ea&s;e: However, Men may conver&s;e with the World, and yet
leave it; we may find Retiredne&s;s in the greate&s;t Ci|ties, we may pa&s;s
thro' a Crowd and not mingle with it; and we may enjoy our &s;elves in a
multitude of unknown Per|&s;ons, <PB N="108" REF="147"> as if they were the
Per&s;onages of an <HI>Arras</HI> Hanging.</P>
<P>Every Ship that &s;ails mu&s;t needs have &s;ome Part of the Ship
under Water; every Man that lives in this World mu&s;t have &s;ome of his
Labours &s;pent upon the World; but as that part of the Ship by which a Man
&s;ails is above the Water, &s;o that part of us which is above the Earth, we
mu&s;t remove it from the World. Thus &s;ome who have attain'd to that
Sublimity of Mind, as to be a|bove all worldly Cares, tho' they med|dle with
the World as being of the World, yet they do it &s;o &s;afely, that they cleave
not to it, nor are a&s;toni&s;hed to leave it.</P>
<P>Thus many great Men, after the Fruition of all Earthly Honours, have
much preferr'd Solitude; As <HI>Snatocopias</HI> King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI>
after the Lo&s;s of a Battle again&s;t the Emperor <HI>Arnold,</HI> he retired
into a De&s;art, where having lived &s;everal Years with three poor Hermits, he
at his Death told them, <HI>There was no Greatne&s;s preferrable to the
Tran|quility of that Solitude he had injoy'd with them, which he e&s;teem'd as
true Happine&s;s; whereas that Life he had led upon his Throne de&s;erv'd more
the Title of Death than Life:</HI> And <HI>Simi|lis</HI> <PB N="109" REF="148">
a great General to the Emperor <HI>Adrian,</HI> after all his Honours and
Pre|ferments, retir'd into the Country for &s;even Years before his Death, and
caus'd this Epitaph to be written upon his Tomb: <HI>Here lies</HI> Similis
<HI>of a very great Age, who yet lived but &s;even Years</HI>; rela|ting only
to the Time of his Retire|ment.</P>
<P>It was nobly ob&s;erv'd by that great Emperor <HI>Marcus
Aurelius,</HI> who was al&s;o a Philo&s;opher, That a Weaver or a Cobler would
willingly &s;eque&s;ter them|&s;elves from all Company, that they might
pro&s;ecute their &s;everal Trades; and yet Man cannot retire him&s;elf that he
may admire the Creation, and exerci&s;e his own Soul, which is the great Trade
of a rational Creature, and of a true Phi|lo&s;opher: And &s;ince Gain can
prevail &s;o far with Men, as to make them re|nounce Society, and e&s;teem
Company an idle Folly, why &s;hould not we reflect upon the great Advantages of
Retire|ment, both as to Morality and Devo|tion, which are much preferrable to
tho&s;e Things which are in them&s;elves but Tri|fles if not Burthens. For
certainly So|litude hath more Plea&s;ures in it, than any Publick Employment,
for it drives us into Contemplation, which is &s;o charm|ing, 
<PB N="110" REF="149"> that it may rather be &s;aid to ravi&s;h than plea&s;e,
committing &s;o open a Rap|ture upon our Souls, that it puts them almo&s;t into
a State of Separation.</P>
<P>Thus the old Hermits, Members of the Catholick Church, are often
remar|ked for being as far tran&s;ported out of them&s;elves, as they had
formerly tran|&s;ported them&s;elves out of the World: And even among&s;t the
Heathens, we find <HI>Pythagoras</HI> almo&s;t di&s;tracted with the
Satisfaction he conceiv'd in finding out his Demon&s;trations: And
<HI>Pliny</HI> was &s;o delighted with the Plea&s;ure of con|templating the
Rarities of the Moun|tain <HI>Ve&s;uvius,</HI> as for farther Inquiry he
approach'd &s;o near, that he lo&s;t him&s;elf in the Flames of it.</P>
<P>What Calmne&s;s and Contentment did <HI>Archimedes</HI> &s;hew in
the mid&s;t of the Ruins of <HI>Syracu&s;e,</HI> being &s;o pleas'd with his
Demon&s;tration, and &s;o bu&s;ie about his Knowledge and Contemplation, as he
heard not the Noi&s;e and Clamours of the Enemy, and could not &s;pare &s;o
much Time from his Intendment, as to ask Life from the rude Conquerors, when he
was interrupted and kill'd by them. Here was a Tranquility which look'd
gloriou&s;ly thro' Danger and Death: It is not Pomp and &s;hining Robes that 
<PB N="111" REF="150"> give Grace to the Body, but it is the Mind within the
Body.</P>
<P><HI>Socrates,</HI> that great Ma&s;ter of Breed|ing, tells us, That
young Men &s;hould be in&s;tructed, Men in the Flower of their Age exercis'd in
well-doing; but old Men &s;hould withdraw them&s;elves, and retire from all
worldly Affairs: It being no le&s;s than highly nece&s;&s;ary, that a &s;pace
of Time &s;hould be interpos'd, between the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Life, and the Day
of Death, that when they come to leave the World, they may have no|thing el&s;e
to do but to Die. And who|&s;oever hath laid up in his Mind where|with to
entertain him&s;elf in the Shadow and Retirement of his Age, will look upon
that temperate Climate of his Time as the mo&s;t &s;weetned and dige&s;ted part
of his whole Life, free from the Hurry|ings of all the other, he then treats
him|&s;elf with the be&s;t Company, that of his own Thoughts and
Ob&s;ervations; and with the Philo&s;opher, when others are &s;orry he is grown
Old, he is only &s;orry that he was ever Young. Indeed, when Decrepitne&s;s
kills Experience, when Age acts the Prologue to Death, and draws the Curtains
before our Sen&s;es, it is then high time to give that Life leave to think only
of Death, and to prepare for its <PB N="112" REF="151"> la&s;t Journey: For it
is a Right and Ju|&s;tice Men owe them&s;elves, who have given their mo&s;t
active and flouri&s;hing Age to the World, to give their declining Age to
Solitude and Retirement, and &s;ince they have liv'd long enough for others,
they ought to give the Remainder of their Lives to them&s;elves to call in
the&s;e Thoughts and Intentions; and &s;ince God gives them lei&s;ure to
prepare for and order their Remove, they ought to make them&s;elves ready, to
di&s;intangle them&s;elves from their worldly Engage|ments, and &s;ince they
have hitherto liv'd Swimming and Floating, they &s;hould come now, and Die in
the Har|bour; it being but rea&s;onable for that Man to &s;hake off Society
that can bring nothing to it; he that cannot Lend, let him take heed of
Borrowing; and when our Forces fail us, it is then a part of Prudence, as well
as Safety, to retire. But for Men in the Strength of their Manly Vigour, that
are endowed with publick Abilities, and excellent Orna|ments, the u&s;e whereof
is only in So|ciety, for &s;uch to retire for their Ea&s;e or Idlene&s;s, and
to do good to none but them&s;elves, is very injurious to the Publick, and
re&s;i&s;ts not only Rea&s;on but Goodne&s;s, both which join in guid|ing 
<PB N="113" REF="152"> us to common Good. A Man of excellent Parts, who thus
retires under Pretence of meditating, and leaves no Fruit of his Meditations to
the World, is like the River of <HI>Jordan,</HI> who&s;e fair and quick Water
is lo&s;t in the Lake of <HI>Sodom,</HI> call'd the <HI>Dead Sea.</HI> This is
to Die living, to lo&s;e the Quickne&s;s of the Mind in the Gulph of
unprofitable Idle|ne&s;s; it is indeed leaving the World in the wor&s;e
Sen&s;e, for it is a for&s;aking Mankind, and denying to Society that Service
and Duty which we owe it.</P>
<P>For if Men of Publick Employments and Profe&s;&s;ions &s;hould
husband all their Time &s;o thriftily, as not to give any Part thereof to
Bu&s;ine&s;s, but be&s;tow it all in Retiredne&s;s, yet even thereby they would
contract a Guiltine&s;s: As the Eagle were very unnatural, if (becau&s;e &s;he
is able to do it) &s;he &s;hould pearch a whole Day upon a Tree, &s;taring in
Con|templation of the Glory and Maje&s;ty of the Sun, and in the mean time let
her young Eaglets &s;tarve in their Ne&s;t.</P>
<P>Both ancient and modern Hi&s;tories have furni&s;h'd us with
Examples of &s;ome Kings, who have willingly re&s;igned their Kingdoms, and
depo&s;ed them&s;elves; but whether they did this meerly out of a De&s;ire to
live retiredly, or to &s;atisfie <PB N="114" REF="153"> their Sons being
arrived at Years fitting to Rule, that &s;o they might &s;ee the
Suc|ce&s;&s;ion &s;ettled in their own Blood, or to &s;hun the Tumults of
Rebellion, or out of Fear of &s;ome potent Enemy, or un|aptne&s;s of
Government, are great Que|&s;tions left as yet undecided in the World. But if
any Prince hath done &s;o gallant an Action, (which is &s;o &s;trongly
with|&s;tood by human Nature) as to renounce a Kingdom, by Virtue of a Soul
in|amoured of that Felicity which is injoy'd in a private Life, and that out of
a well|di&s;po&s;ed Mind he preferr'd the Peace of Retirement before the
Hazards and Trouble of Reigning, and that dive&s;ted him&s;elf of his
pro&s;perous earthly Con|dition, purely that he might be Happy, that Prince was
not only truly Wi&s;e, but was undoubtedly more bound to God for giving him
that Power, and that Performance, than for making him a King. But that King who
&s;hrunk un|der the weight of Government, where Men ought to &s;hew the
greate&s;t Worth, or hath renounced his Kingdom out of Poorne&s;s of Spirit,
that Prince is much to be blamed, for that the true Mode|ration of Soul is
&s;een in gallantly under|going Ca&s;es of Adver&s;ity, and not in lo&s;ing a
Man's &s;elf in Pro&s;perity.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="154">Indeed, Prudent Men, that know them&s;elves
not able to with&s;tand the Temptations of the World, will wi&s;ely and timely
retire from it: Staggs, when they find them&s;elves too fat, are &s;aid to
retire for Safety to the Woods and Thickets, knowing that being burthen'd with
their own Weight, they are not able to run if they &s;hould be hunted; which,
if true, &s;hews a great Provi|dence in Nature. And if we &s;eriou&s;ly
con&s;ider, we &s;hall find that Multitude and Abundance are far more
trouble&s;om, than Solitarine&s;s and Want; in Ab&s;ti|nence, there is only
need of one Duty, but in the conduct and u&s;e of many Things divers Duties are
required. Thus the Calling of a King or Prelate, is far more difficult than
that of a Monk or Hermit, and the Sociable Life is much harder than the
Solitary, by how much it is more ea&s;ie for a Man to live altogether without a
Wife, than in all Points duly to live and maintain him&s;elf with her; and
therefore Sir <HI>Thomas Overbury,</HI> a very ingenious Man, was us'd to
&s;ay, <HI>That next to no Wife, a good Wife was be&s;t:</HI> For he that hath
Wife and Children, Servants, E&s;tate, and Bu&s;ine&s;s, hath without
compari&s;on a more trouble&s;om Task, than he that <PB N="116" REF="155"> hath
none of all the&s;e, and hath only to do with him&s;elf: <HI>Facilius e&s;t
domi la|tere, quam foris &s;e po&s;&s;e &s;ufficienter cu|&s;todire:</HI> And
therefore Speculative ju|dicious Men do di&s;creetly and piou&s;ly, that leave
the Employments of the World which require the whole Man, to give them&s;elves
&s;ome Intervals to the Office of Men, as they are Men and Chri|&s;tians.</P>
<P>Such Retreats as the&s;e are mo&s;t com|mendable, where Men
&s;eque&s;ter them|&s;elves from the Troubles of the World, that they may the
better <HI>vacare Deo &amp; &s;tudiis:</HI> For thus they do more good living
out of the World than in it; Nei|ther do &s;uch Men as the&s;e embrace
So|litude out of meanne&s;s of Spirit, or for weakne&s;s of Parts, as not fit
to attain Greatne&s;s, or not able to bear with the World, but they do it
purely, that they may arrive at that Happine&s;s which is u&s;ually injoy'd in
a retired virtuous Life.</P>
<P>Hi&s;tory affords us many Examples of Men, who have known how to
com|pa&s;s the Prime Places and Supream Dig|nities both in Church and State,
who have had the Acqui&s;ition of Wealth and Greatne&s;s in their Power, tho'
not in their Aim, and who have with much <PB N="117" REF="156"> Honour
relinqui&s;h'd Riches to embrace Poverty, and to enjoy Solitarine&s;s and
Retirement, having voluntarily left the mo&s;t gainful and weighty Employments,
and after a full Fruition of all earthly Happine&s;s and Plea&s;ure, have taken
a &s;olemn Leave of the World, whil&s;t yet Fortune &s;mil'd upon them. A great
Example in this kind, was <HI>Quintus Mu|tius Po&s;thumius,</HI> that Noble
<HI>Roman,</HI> who having been taken from the Plow to be Con&s;ul, after he
had govern'd that People and conquer'd their Enemies, he return'd to his former
Employment; and being ready to leave the Senate, he called for his Balance, and
by put|ting the Fa&s;ces, the Mark of his Office or Authority in one Scale, and
his Plow in the other, did let the Senators &s;ee, tho&s;e Imperial En&s;igns
were far the lighter, and &s;o took his leave of the Senate, and return'd to
his Plow. Such Men as the&s;e are truly Happy, who have left Cares and Troubles
for Calmne&s;s and Quiet, they po&s;&s;e&s;s a Happine&s;s, which Kings can
neither keep them&s;elves, nor &s;uffer among&s;t their Neighbours; The&s;e are
&s;o far from complaining of the World, that they are content to for|get it,
and are re&s;olved neither to have War nor Commerce with it, having 
<PB N="118" REF="157"> founded a Retreat to all their Pa&s;&s;i|ons, as well
the plea&s;ing, as the trou|ble&s;om.</P>
<P>But we &s;hall find few Men that will be content to do this Thing
&s;eriou&s;ly; &s;udden Wi&s;hes and indeliberate Proffers and Attempts to
renounce the World are but ra&s;h Pangs of &s;eeming Mortifi|cations. There are
not many that will be content with a mean E&s;tate, that will neglect Wealth
and Abundance, and de&s;ire God not to heap too much upon them, but to abate of
his Portion: There are but few that will with <HI>Daniel</HI> refu&s;e the
King's Delicacies, and feed upon Pul&s;e, and with the great St. <HI>Paul</HI>
take Plea&s;ure in Nece&s;&s;ities: Many in|deed will tell us, They are
re&s;olved to quit the World both in Mind and Body, but Cu&s;tom is a Thing we
often fall in|to by flying it, and we &s;hall not unfre|quently hear Men
&s;wear they will not &s;wear. I verily believe many of our Loyal Countrymen
have had &s;o &s;ad Experience of this World, and do &s;o little de&s;ire to
learn that which they are ignorant of therein, that they would be very glad to
forget what they already know of it, and do really wi&s;h they were like &s;ome
of tho&s;e Hermits, that inquir'd how Cities were made, and what kind of 
<PB N="119" REF="158"> Thing a King or a Commonwealth was?</P>
<P>There is no Voice &s;ounds better in a &s;ober Man's Ears, than that
which cry'd to <HI>Ar&s;enius, Fuge, &s;ede, tace</HI>; which coun|&s;els Men
to give them&s;elves Satisfaction by their quiet retiring: <HI>Crede mihi qu
bene latuit, bene vixit,</HI> &s;aid a wi&s;e Man: But yet where&s;oever we
are, or in what Condition &s;oever, (if we can but tell our &s;elves what and
where we would be) we may make any Place or State happy to us: For we are &s;o
compo&s;ed, that if Abundance or Glory &s;corch or melt us, we have an earthly
Cave (our Bodies) to go into by Con&s;ideration, and cool our &s;elves; and if
we be frozen and contracted with lower and dark For|tunes, we have within us a
Torch, a Soul brighter and warmer than any with|out, we are therefore our own
Umbrel|la's, and our own Suns.</P>
<P>But as all Shadows are of one Colour, if we re&s;pect the Body from
which they are ca&s;t; &s;o all Retirings into a &s;hadowy Life, are alike from
all Cau&s;es; only the Employments, and that up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">n which we be&s;tow our Time, gives it the Tin|cture and the Beauty.
Thus our Sha|dows upon Clay will be dirty, and in a Garden green and flowry;
&s;o in our <PB N="120" REF="159"> Retirements, if we only conver&s;e with
Earth, we &s;hall be like it, that is, unlike our &s;elves: But if we be
ingaged in more refined and intellectual Entertain|ments, we &s;hall be
&s;omething more than our &s;elves, that is, than this narrow Cir|cumference of
Earth &s;peaks us, the Soul being always like the Object of its De|light and
Conver&s;e; and therefore well &s;ays the <HI>Roman</HI> Orator,
<HI>Erigimur</HI> &amp; <HI>la|tiores fieri videmur, humana de&s;picimus
contemplant&eacute;&s;que &s;upera &amp; caele&s;tia, haec no&s;tra ut

<P>However, it is not enough to be on|ly &s;eparated from the
Conver&s;e of Peo|ple; for tho' we have freed our &s;elves from the Court and
from the Market, yet we are not thereby free from the principal Torments of our
Life; tho' we change Places never &s;o often, yet may our Vices follow us even
into im|mured Cloy&s;ters: The hollow Rocks, the wearing Hair-Shirts, and
continual Fa&s;ting, rid us not always from them, for a Holy Habit clean&s;es
not a foul Soul. And as <HI>Socrates</HI> being ask'd, <HI>Why one who had been
long abroad, had not more improv'd him&s;elf by Travel,</HI> an&s;wer'd well,
<HI>Becau&s;e he had not left him&s;elf behind him when he went to Travel:</HI>
<PB N="121" REF="160"> So before a Man leaves the World, if he do not fir&s;t
di&s;charge both him&s;elf and his Mind from the Burthen that pre&s;&s;es her,
Retiring will but &s;tir it the more, and pre&s;s it the harder, as a &s;ick
Man takes more Hurt than good by changing Place: It is but &s;ettling an Evil
in&s;tead of removing it, and if we ca&s;t back a kind Look upon what we have
left behind, we &s;till carry our Fet|ters along with us, and are not at
Li|berty. We ought therefore fir&s;t to re|cover our &s;elves from our
&s;elves, for without managing our Superior Part, all the Pains taken about the
Inferior is to no purpo&s;e: And he that only chan|ges his Cloth of Gold for a
Monk's Habit, and his <HI>Point de Venice</HI> for a Demy Collar, &s;hall
without doubt be a Lo&s;er by the Bargain: It is indeed no &s;uch ea&s;ie
Matter, as many Men believe, to make a &s;afe Retreat from the World, to
tru&s;s up our Baggage, and bid our Company farewel; this is a Burthen which
few Men can take up hand&s;ome|ly: For a Man to anticipate the Acci|dents of
Fortune, to deprive him&s;elf of his pre&s;ent Advantages, is an Action of
extream Difficulty, as well as of an ex|traordinary Virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="161">But tho' the doing the&s;e Things &s;eem very
&s;evere to our worldly Imaginations, and to tho&s;e who never had Experience
in them&s;elves of this noble&s;t Operation of the Soul; yet doth this retiring
pro|duce &s;o great Effects, and carries with it &s;uch &s;piritual Charms and
Delights, that &s;hould good Fortune her &s;elf come in Per&s;on to find them
out, who are thus withdrawn, to invite them again into the World, yet would
they &s;hut their Doors again&s;t her; and tho' &s;he &s;hould tell her Name,
&s;he &s;hould not be admitted. The Religious retir'd Man is an inverted
Pyramid, Earth hath but the lea&s;t Point of it; A Soul that dwells in Heaven
will not dabble in this im|pure Mud, or &s;toop to be a Copartner in the
Delights of the Creatures, that have nothing but Bea&s;t in them; and tho' it
be nece&s;&s;itated by its relation to Fle&s;h to a terre&s;tial Conver&s;e,
yet it is like the Sun without contaminating its Beams.</P>
<P>Thus Religious Per&s;ons, when they come abroad into the World,
partake not of any worldly Humour, they can &s;afely look upon the Throng, and
(more truly than <HI>Socrates</HI> at the <HI>Olympian</HI> Games) give God
thanks, that he hath made them not to need tho&s;e many <PB N="123" REF="162">
Things which others &s;o vainly and vio|lently pur&s;ue: Their rais'd

to &s;hew the World their Folly in admiring it) po&s;&s;e&s;s Delights, which
in a manner an|tidate Immortality, and (tho' at an hum|ble di&s;tance)
re&s;emble the Joys above, they receiving here &s;ome Anticipations of immortal
Delights, as Pledges of their eternal Rewards; for there want not Examples of
&s;ome, who have had their Souls elevated to &s;uch a height of intel|lectual
Contemplation, that God hath made them as it were, in &s;ome mea&s;ure,
Patterns of the Happine&s;s of the Life to come, which he hath &s;ometimes
vouch&s;afed to &s;hew us here below, to make us in Love with the Piece above
in Heaven.</P>
<P>This Divine Contemplation is, <HI>pro|mus &amp; condus coeli &amp;
&s;itula gratiae</HI>; it opens to us all the Trea&s;ures of Heaven; This
remedies all our Sorrows, &s;ettles and compo&s;es all our Di&s;tractions, and
ravi&s;hes our Spirits with un&s;peakable De|lights; to which purpo&s;e St.

not able to appre|hend their inward Sweetne&s;s and De|light; the very Fire and
Flames were to the Martyrs, Flowers and Perfumes.</HI></P>
<P>How injurious a Scandal is it there|fore, which we are apt to ca&s;t
upon Re|ligious Per&s;ons, repre&s;enting them with angry and &s;toical
Countenances, and de|faming them with melancholy and un|&s;ociable Humours,
believing Retirement to be a State, wherein the Soul contracts a Ru&s;t, which
cankers its own Sub|&s;tance, and makes it unplea&s;ant to others; Whereas our
Saviour a&s;&s;ures us, there is no Life &s;o plea&s;ant and happy; and tho' he
him&s;elf is &s;aid never to have Laugh|ed, yet his Countenance is &s;aid ever
to have been Smiling, and in full Condemna|tion of moro&s;e Humours, it was
prophe|&s;ied of him, <HI>Quod non e&s;&s;et tri&s;tis</HI> in his
Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>It is indeed an ill way of judging, That Men cannot have Piety in
their Hearts without Au&s;terity in their Looks, (a Virtue &s;tuck with
Bri&s;tles is too rough, when adorn'd with Flowers it will be willingly
entertain'd) a cloudy di&s;con|tented Face is not the only, or be&s;t &s;ign of
Devotion, very merry Men have been very holy and devout Men: No 
<PB N="125" REF="164"> Man loves to &s;ee &s;uch Religious, who&s;e Thorns he

<HEAD>Of St. MARY MAGDALEN's Life and Conver&s;ion; with &s;ome

<P>_BEING in a Place and Sea|&s;on where every Thing be|gins to Bud, I
mu&s;t do &s;o too, and vent &s;ome of my Thoughts; tho' perhaps, as all other
Buds are yet without Ta&s;te or Virtue, the&s;e Lines may be al&s;o dull and
in&s;ipid; and tho' the Plea&s;antne&s;s of the Sea&s;on invites me, it does
not much plea&s;e me, &s;ince I &s;ee every Thing refre&s;hes, but I wither and
grow Older, but not Better, my Strength dimini&s;hes, and my Load grows
heavier.</P>
<P>There are certain Rules for the Bo|dy's Infirmities, which if
rightly ob&s;erv'd will effect their Cure; but for the Di|&s;ea&s;es of the
Mind, there is no Rule, for our own Ta&s;te and Apprehen&s;ion, which &s;hould
be the Judge, is the Di&s;ea&s;e it &s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="167">I am now no more tran&s;ported with Jollity,
and the love of Company, ha|ving at pre&s;ent Loads heavy at my Heels, which
bring to my Thoughts my ill Fortune, my old Age, the Duties of a Man, of a
Subject, of a Husband, of a Father, with all the Incumbrances of a numerous
Family; the&s;e Thoughts de|ject me into Sadne&s;s and Melancholy, and from
thence into a &s;erious Contem|plation of the Troubles and Mi&s;eries of this
Mortal Life; which have farther in|duced me, in this Time of Solemn De|votion,
to entertain my Thoughts upon &s;ome Divine Subject, the better to com|po&s;e
my Mind and &s;ubmit my Will to the Orders of Divine Providence.</P>
<P>I know well, as no Beauty, &s;o no Di&s;cour&s;e hath all Voices,
even in the wor&s;t Faces &s;ome Eyes &s;ee Features that plea&s;e, in the

Plat a Lawrel for that Head, on which others in their Opinion would be&s;tow a

<P>The Scripture is every where full of Variety, like a Garment of

I will not contemn the Judgment of the Wi&s;e, nor refu&s;e to learn from any

<P>The laborious Bee is the Emblem of a working Brain, which Creature
is &s;et <PB N="130" REF="169"> before us for a Copy of Indu&s;try; it is not
always droning upon one Flower, but throws her light aiery Body upon a

It is no le&s;s indeed than a wonder, that of almo&s;t the Shadow rather than
the Sub|&s;tance of &s;o very &s;mall a living Creature, Nature hath made &s;o
incomparable a Thing. I had rather imitate this labo|rious In&s;ect, than
challenge to my &s;elf <HI>Arachne</HI>'s Motto, <HI>Mihi &s;oli debeo.</HI> I

Di&s;qui&s;itions, and will not be curious where the Scripture is &s;ilent:
Who&s;oever &s;he was, &s;he &s;till carries the Name of what for &s;ome time
&s;he was, <HI>A Woman that was a Sinner.</HI></P>
<P>We commonly &s;ee &s;ome artificial Pi|ctures, which according to
divers Sights and A&s;pects, repre&s;ent divers Things; &s;uch an admirable
Peice, with a double Re&s;emblance, hath St. <HI>Luke</HI> (an excel|lent

the word, <HI>Ecce,</HI> Behold, like a Curtain before &s;ome exact Piece of
Workman&s;hip, which likewi&s;e <PB N="132" REF="171"> hath a double Reference
to the Power of Chri&s;t who drew this Sinner, and to his Mercy who receiv'd
her.</P>
<P>In this noble Hi&s;tory are &s;everal weigh|ty Circum&s;tances like
&s;o many Wedges of Gold in a rich Mineral, and one In|got appears at the Head

the Reader may judge nece&s;&s;ary on the particular Sin, for which this Woman
was publickly noted, let me put him in Mind of the An&s;wer which the Comic
Poet gave, who being accus'd of having brought a Lewd debauch'd Ruffian up|on
the Stage, and &s;o &s;etting a bad Ex|ample to young Men: <HI>'Tis true,</HI>
&s;ays he, <HI>I brought &s;uch a Man on, but I hang'd him before he went off,
and &s;o I gave them a good Example.</HI> Here is a better Le&s;|&s;on to be
learn'd: All Women may ac|cept this Woman as a Pattern to imitate, and even the

appear at fir&s;t, let us &s;u&s;pend <PB N="133" REF="172"> our Cen&s;ure till
the la&s;t Act, then we &s;hall find how &s;he became <HI>&agrave;

leb&eacute;te, phi|ala,</HI> of a Caldron boiling with Lu&s;t, a Chry&s;tall
Vial of pure Cha&s;tity; how &s;he that at fir&s;t was running apace into the
<HI>Dead Sea,</HI> did &s;peedily turn into the Path to
<HI>Paradi&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall begin with her Fall, and con|&s;ider her fir&s;t as a
Sinner.</P>
<P>But alas! who is not &s;o? Had &s;he not been a Sinner &s;he had
been a Miracle; he that knows him&s;elf to be a Man, knows him&s;elf to be a
Sinner, for in the Loyns of our fir&s;t Parents we all &s;inned; &s;o that it
is ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e a Separation of Sin from Man's Nature: In our
Conceptions thro' that Original Pollution, we are all warm'd in unclean Blood,
and &s;till we continue <HI>ponere Adam &s;uper Adam,</HI> to add new Sin to
our Ori|ginal Sin: This Hereditary Poi&s;on is in|bred in every Man, and the
Sullage of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Clay &s;ticks fa&s;t to us: By <HI>Adam</HI>'s
&s;inning all his Seed are become &s;inful, and all his Off-&s;pring, as in a

forth corrupted Fruits.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t perfect and glorious Light in the World is the Sun in the

And what Son of <HI>Adam</HI> was ever found, thro' the Zodiack of who&s;e Life
an Ecliptick could not be drawn? A Man without Sin is like the Mountain of
Gold, or the Philo&s;opher's Stone, which have no Exi&s;tance but in Theory and
the Operation of the Under&s;tanding. In Schola&s;tical Speculations you will
hear the Noi&s;e of &s;uch a Being, but you &s;hall no &s;ooner find him than
the Eccho in the Poet, <HI>Quem non invenis u&s;quam, e&s;&s;e putas
nu&s;quam:</HI> Such Utopical Perfe|ction is only an idle Dream of the
Do|nati&s;ts. It is the Voice of an Apo&s;tle, <HI>In many Things we offend
all.</HI> Nothing more certain, than that Corruption has deep Root in God's
peculiar People: Even their be&s;t Works (and they too like <HI>Solomon</HI>'s
Sculpture, <HI>a little upon a Pillar rare and few</HI>) will but weigh light
in the Scales of the Sanctuary. As the Curtezan <HI>Lais</HI> &s;aid,
<HI>Philo&s;ophers did &s;ometimes knock at her Gates, as well as other
Men</HI>; &s;o the be&s;t Men are often overtaken by human Frailties; let the
be&s;t do what they can, they are but im|perfectly Good, in &s;ome Matter or
other they &s;tep a&s;ide from God's Commands. It is a Truth as clear as the
Sun, that the Seeds of Sin are in all Men, the Seeds not the Practice; there is
not in <PB N="135" REF="174"> all the &s;ame Eruption, but there is in all the
&s;ame Corruption. Some are Kytes, others Hawks, and the re&s;t Eagles, and yet
all from the &s;ame Eyrie; he that bears Humanity about him, he that's cloathed
with Fle&s;h and Blood, cannot but Sin: And yet tho' we cannot avoid being
Tempted, yet we may &s;hun the Commi&s;&s;ion of Sin. It is one Thing to dart
and glance a wanton De&s;ire, and another to court and plead for it. Tho' the
Motions of Fle&s;h be alike in all Men, yet the humouring tho&s;e Motions is
not &s;o. It is one Thing for a Man to Sin, another to give him&s;elf over to
the Com|mi&s;&s;ion of Sin. This continuance in any notorious Sin, is not only
a Grave to the Soul, but a great Stone rolled to the Mouth thereof to keep it
down.</P>
<P>What <HI>Era&s;mus</HI> &s;ays of <HI>Paris, That after a Man hath
u&s;ed him&s;elf to the odious Scent of it, it grows more and more agreeable to
him,</HI> is too true of Sin, which by long Entertainment be|comes Cu&s;tomary,
and not ea&s;ie to be di&s;mi&s;s'd.</P>
<P>We know that an expert Swimmer, being under Water, feels not the
weight of a full freighted Ship of a thou&s;and Tuns riding perpendicularly
over his Head; &s;o whil&s;t we &s;wim in the Cu&s;tom <PB N="136" REF="175">
of any plea&s;ing Sin, we are in&s;en&s;ible of the Burthen of it; for
frequency of Sin doth fle&s;h us in Immode&s;ty, a&s;&s;iduity in Impudence,
and that Sin is almo&s;t in|curable that is &s;teel'd by Cu&s;tom; which is a
true Character given of this Wo|man, who is not de&s;cribed as a Woman who had
&s;inned, but <HI>a Woman that was a Sinner</HI>; it was not a tran&s;ient, but
a permanent Condition, that gave her that Denomination, her long continuance in
her Trade had branded her with this Title, <HI>A Woman that was a
Sinner.</HI></P>
<P>This Woman was of a Noble De&s;cent, and (as is generally receiv'd)
was re|markable for a luxurious and inconti|nent Life; and in tho&s;e loo&s;e
Days, wherein <HI>Herod</HI> erected his Theaters and Amphitheaters, Debauchery
was very much encouraged. And however Wan|tons may flatter them&s;elves, and
take that for true Doctrine, which the un|wi&s;e Tutor &s;ometime &s;poke in
the Comedy, <HI>Non e&s;t crede mihi, adole&s;|centi; It is no &s;uch Fault in
a young Man to follow Harlots</HI>; yet it is &s;uch a Sin, as commonly drives
to the Devil at once, a Sin which once indulged be|comes what may be call'd a
plea&s;ant Madne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="176">Hi&s;tory tells us of a certain Well in
<HI>Epirus</HI> that will quench Firebrands if put into it, and yet when they
are quenched it will pre&s;ently &s;et them on Fire again: Like this Water is a
la&s;ci|vious Woman, when &s;he quencheth the Lu&s;t of the Body for a time,
&s;he &s;etteth it on Fire afterwards much more witti|ly: Therefore
<HI>Fon&s;eca</HI> the <HI>Spaniard</HI> hath Emblem'd this Vice by the
Phoe|nix, which does revive and renew her &s;elf by the Fire which &s;he
kindles by the Motion of her Wings. Thus we mourn perhaps, and bewail, and
repent, of the Sin we have committed, and de&s;ire to give it over, that it may
Die with us, but with the Wings of our Thoughts we blow tho&s;e Coals afre&s;h,
and make them Flame more than be|fore.</P>
<P>Thus we walk the Round, fir&s;t we act a Sin becau&s;e the Thought
plea&s;es us, then we think that Sin over again, becau&s;e the Act hath pleas'd
us; and among&s;t the great variety of Sins, there is none more plau&s;ible,
nor more plea|&s;ing to Nature than Wantonne&s;s: How many &s;et their Souls
burning in the Flames thereof, and (as <HI>Nero</HI> did when he had &s;et
<HI>Rome</HI> on Fire) behold them with Tran&s;port and Delight? How 
<PB N="138" REF="177"> many &s;illy Wretches, like the fooli&s;h Lark, whil&s;t
it playeth with the Fea|ther, and &s;toopeth to the Gla&s;s, are caught in the
Fowler's Net? For a la&s;civious Woman (to give a &s;hort but true Character of
her) is the Devil's Pitfall, a Trap to catch our Souls: Her Eyes, like free
Doctors, live upon the &s;poil of Stragglers; &s;he baits her De|&s;ires with a
Million of pro&s;tituted Coun|tenances, her di&s;play'd Brea&s;ts, and loo&s;e
Glances, Locks wantonly waving over her Shoulders, her artificial Complecti|on,
(the Counterfeit of the Great Seal of Nature) her curl'd Hair, (the
Sophi|&s;try of the old cunning Serpent) her high Wa&s;hes and Paintings are
&s;o many Lures to bring the Adulterer to the Snare.</P>
<P>But cha&s;te Thoughts will check and never &s;toop to &s;uch
Enticements; For when Fire falleth on Fuel that is wet it pre&s;ently goeth
out.</P>
<P>When <HI>Potiphar</HI>'s Wife, one of the greate&s;t Ladies in
<HI>Egypt,</HI> did inordi|nately affect, impudently &s;ollicit, and, in a
manner, force the Mode&s;ty of her good Servant <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> how much
rather did he leave his Garment than his Vir|tue? Nor did he re&s;cue him&s;elf
from Adultery and Danger by Violence to her <PB N="139" REF="178"> Per&s;on,
nor neglect the Duties he owed her as a Servant, but with the hazard of his
Name, Life and Liberty, he made an innocent E&s;cape to pre&s;erve his bet|ter
Garment of Cha&s;tity.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arabian</HI> Proverb is elegant, <HI>Ob|&s;true quinque
fene&s;tras ut luceat domus, Shut the five Windows that the Hou&s;e may be
light&s;ome</HI>; clean&s;e the Limbeck of the Sen&s;es, lea&s;t thence &s;ome
Polluti|on drop into the Soul. If at once we would overcome the Temptation and
the Tempter, we mu&s;t re&s;olve, with <HI>Alipius,</HI> to &s;hut our Eyes
when we come among&s;t Vanities; for the Eye is the fir&s;t Part that is
&s;truck in &s;uch Engage|ments, upon the fir&s;t A&s;&s;ault it yields up our
&s;tronge&s;t Fort: The <HI>Eye</HI> be&s;ides is the vaine&s;t of all the
Sen&s;es, it takes ex|tream Delight to be cheated; one of the Plea&s;ures of
the Eye is the Decep|tion of it, and how ea&s;ie is that Sen&s;e deluded which
delights to be deceived.</P>
<P>The antient Philo&s;ophers before <HI>A|ri&s;totle,</HI> that held
Vi&s;ion to be perform'd by an Emi&s;&s;ion of Beams, imagin'd the Eye to be of
a fiery Nature, wherein they were confirm'd by ob&s;erving, if the Eye had a
Blow, Fire &s;eems to &s;par|kle out of it: But certainly, how watry &s;oever
better Experience hath found the <PB N="140" REF="179"> Sub&s;tance of the Eye,
it is <HI>&s;piritually fiery,</HI> both actively and pa&s;&s;ively;
pa&s;|&s;ively for that it is inflamed by every wanton Beam, actively it &s;ets
the whole Heart on Fire with the inordinate Flames of Concupi&s;ence: Thus
<HI>Sichem</HI> &s;aw <HI>Di|nah</HI> and defiled her; <HI>Viderunt Oculi,
ra|puerant pectora flammoe,</HI> no &s;ooner did he &s;ee her than his Brea&s;t
was inflam'd with <HI>Lu&s;t.</HI> Thus <HI>Amon</HI> fell &s;ick for
<HI>Tamar</HI>'s Sake, his De&s;ire of her began at the fir&s;t Interview. Thus
when <HI>David</HI> walked upon the Roof of his Palace, and di&s;|covered from
thence a beautiful Woman wa&s;hing her &s;elf; here was <HI>Mulier
long&egrave;, libido prope,</HI> for his petulant Eye recoil'd upon his Heart,
and &s;mote him with vitious De&s;ires. Yet it is not the <HI>Eye</HI> it
&s;elf, (for what is that but the Beauty of the Face, the bright Star of the
Orb it moves in) but the Viciou&s;ne&s;s of the <HI>Eye</HI> that is to be
condemned; when we talk with our Eyes, then 'tis that we &s;in with them. But I
dare not inlarge up|on this Subject for fear of committing that which was a
noted Fault in <HI>Marcel|lus</HI> the Rhetorition, (as <HI>Suetonius</HI>
tells us) that lighting on a Figure he would pur&s;ue it till he forgot the
Matter in hand; I will therefore return to di&s;cour&s;e more particularly of
this <HI>Woman,</HI> &s;o &s;in|ful <PB N="141" REF="180"> in her Life, &s;o
hateful for her Lu&s;t, and &s;o devoted to Incontinence, that &s;he was become
a common Scandal: For by her bad Example &s;he made the City &s;o infamous,
that &s;he might more fitly be call'd, <HI>peccatum Hiero&s;olymae quam
peccatrix,</HI> the Sin of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> rather than a Sinner in
<HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> as <HI>Petrus Chry&s;ologus</HI> ob&s;erves, becau&s;e
the whole City &s;har'd the Di&s;grace which &s;he de|&s;erv'd.</P>
<P>Sin is Sin wherever committed, whe|ther before a Multitude, or in a
De&s;art; yet the more publick the Fact is, the greater is the Scandal, and
this Woman's Offence was the more notorious, be|cau&s;e &s;he was a <HI>City
Sinner.</HI></P>
<P>I confe&s;s that no Place can &s;ecure one from Temptations, which
come in too ha&s;tily and uninvited, like rough Winds from every Corner of the
Sky, and in &s;uch Number, as if each Minute were computed by them.</P>
<P>We are apt to Fall, becau&s;e we are Mutable, but we do not commonly
Fall except &s;ome Occa&s;ion be given; and how full is the World of &s;uch
Occa&s;ions? Our common Adver&s;ary, the <HI>Devil</HI> (who has a thou&s;and
Ways of attacking us) finds how apt we are to &s;tumble at &s;omething or other
in our way: He <PB N="142" REF="181"> knows which way our corrupted Na|ture
bends, he &s;ifteth out what will work upon our Affections and
Di&s;po&s;i|tions, and with that he wooes our Con|&s;ent to Sin; like a skilful
Sailor he marks the Wind, and accordingly hoi&s;teth up or &s;triketh Sail; or,
like a cunning Poet, he gives every Actor a Part agreeable, and makes a
perpetual U&s;e of the Bent of our Nature: Thus hath he a Wedge of Gold for
covetous <HI>Achan,</HI> a Crown for ambitious <HI>Ab&s;alom,</HI> and a
<HI>Dinah</HI> for <HI>Sichem.</HI> And the Concurrence of Time and Place are
his principal Engines, which &s;erve to give Aim to &s;uch Faults as our Nature
is too apt to commit with|out a Prompter; then &s;urely in a cor|rupt debauched
<HI>City</HI> are more Invitati|ons to Sin, than in private Cells. In a large
Concour&s;e of People you'll find many Brokers of Villany, who live up|on the
Spoil of the unthinking Part of Mankind. Where many Pots are boil|ing there
mu&s;t needs be much <HI>Scum</HI>; where Multitudes of Strangers meet, where
Variety of Delights entertain the Eye, it is more difficult to avoid
Tem|ptations, for our Nature herein is like Fire, which, if there be any
Infection in the Room, draws it to its &s;elf, or like Jeat, which, omitting
all more noble <PB N="143" REF="182"> and precious things, attracts only Straws
and Dirt.</P>
<P>It was in a <HI>City</HI> where this Woman liv'd, where by her lewd
Example &s;he drew in others to offend, and her Ex|ample was more prejudicial
becau&s;e &s;he was of a good Family: <HI>Satan</HI>'s Infecti|ons many times
&s;end their Influence through &s;ome great Star into le&s;&s;er Bo|dies, for
Example is like a Stone thrown into a Pond, which makes Cir|cles which dilate
them&s;elves till they are &s;topped by the Banks; or like a Plague-&s;ore
which infects the By-&s;tanders and Lookers on.</P>
<P>I do not find the Name of the City &s;et down, yet many are bold to
affirm it was <HI>Naim,</HI> others will have it <HI>Jeru|&s;alem</HI>;
where-ever &s;he liv'd &s;he was too well known in her Time, and having
al|ready &s;hew'd what her Offence was, I will not lay my Finger again upon
that Blot; and having thus far drawn the black Lines of her Life, I will now
look on the other Part, and con&s;ider her as &s;he hath put off the
<HI>Sinner,</HI> and as &s;he is now become a <HI>Penitent.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Scipio</HI> (as <HI>Livy</HI> &s;ays) never look'd &s;o fre&s;h,
nor appeared &s;o lovely to the Eyes of his Soldiers, as after his Recovery
from a dangerous Sickne&s;s in the Camp; &s;o <PB N="144" REF="183"> neither
does the <HI>Soul</HI> ever &s;eem more beautiful than when &s;he is re&s;tor'd
to Health after &s;ome dangerous Conflict. The <HI>Palladium</HI> was very much
e&s;teem'd by both <HI>Trojans</HI> and <HI>Graecians,</HI> not &s;o much for

<P>To &s;ee Men turning from God to the World, from Piety to

of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s un&s;peakable Mercy; who of the knottie&s;t and mo&s;t

&agrave; Dextris, pendeamus &agrave; Dextris:</HI> Let us be content to
&s;uffer, but &s;uffer in the Right, &s;uffering as a Malefactor is &s;omewhat
too much on the Left Hand; and yet even that Suffering does bring many to the
Right Hand, being joyned with a true and hearty Re|pentance, which is as a City
of Refuge to fly unto, it is the happy Plank that has &s;av'd many a
<HI>Soul</HI> from the <HI>Gulph</HI> of De|&s;pair, the Board which after
Shipwrack <PB N="151" REF="190"> will carry us &s;afe unto Land; and it is not
ill compared to a <HI>Phaenix</HI>'s Ne&s;t, wherein the <HI>Old Adam</HI> is
con&s;um'd to A&s;hes, out of which ari&s;es a new Man of God; for Conver&s;ion
is a Sacred Rid|dle, wherein when we are Born, we are Buried; and when we are
quicken'd we are kill'd, and when we are mortified we are rais'd. Thus
<HI>Nineve</HI> was over|thrown and yet not overthrown, it was overthrown by
Sin, and built again by Repentance. He that is a skillful Peni|tent does
cunningly play this After-game, and a Sinner after his Recovery for the mo&s;t
part &s;eeks <HI>God</HI> more fervently, and is more fearful of Relap&s;ing,
than be|fore of Sinning; like wild Bea&s;ts break|ing from their Toils, they
are more cau|tious for the future, and the <HI>Saints</HI> come out of the Bed
of their Sins, as <HI>Heze|kiah</HI> did out of his &s;ick Bed, more Hum|ble,
more Holy, more Penitent; as the <HI>Eagle</HI> that is weary'd, comes out of
the Water, into which &s;he has dip'd her Wings, with a more towering A&s;cent
towards <HI>Heaven</HI> than ever. <HI>Dum pete|ret Regem,</HI> &s;ays
<HI>Martial,</HI> when <HI>Mutius Scaevola</HI> mi&s;&s;ed his Aim, and
in&s;tead of killing <HI>Por&s;enna,</HI> &s;lew one of his Secre|taries by
mi&s;take, he pre&s;ently offer'd that Hand which gave the Blow as a 
<PB N="152" REF="191"> willing Sacrifice to the Flame, which Hand grew famous
for being deceiv'd; and it had been le&s;s Reputation to have &s;truck his
Enemy to the Heart, than to puni&s;h it &s;o &s;toutly for mi&s;&s;ing its Aim;
upon which the Poet took Occa&s;ion to &s;ay, 
<Q> 
<L>Major deceptae fama e&s;t &amp; gloria dextrae,</L> 
<L>Si non erra&s;&s;et, fecerat illa minus.</L></Q> Without any
change, I may apply it to <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI>'s Conver&s;ion: 
<Q>Si non pecca&s;&s;et fecerat illa minus.</Q> She would not have
been &s;o famous, had &s;he not &s;inn'd; neither is this a Parodox; for what
an Enemy would upbraid by way of Reproach, is the greate&s;t Prai&s;e that can
be; their very Sins do honour &s;ome, as the <HI>Devils</HI> did <HI>Mary
Magdalen,</HI> who are mention'd for her Glory, &s;ince we do not hear of them
until they were ca&s;t out; For Repentance is a <HI>Super|cedeas</HI> that
di&s;chargeth Sin, making <HI>God</HI> to be merciful, <HI>Angels</HI> to be
joyful, and <HI>Man</HI> to be acceptable: And as St. <HI>Au&s;tin</HI>
affirms, <HI>It is a greater Deliverance, a mightier Miracle, and a bigger
Grace, that a Sinner &s;hould be Converted, than</HI> <PB N="153" REF="192">
<HI>that being converted he &s;hould after|wards be &s;aved:</HI> Here we &s;ee
<HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> being now touch'd with Re|pentance for her former Sins
and Vani|ties, like the thir&s;ty and panting Hart in the extremity of Heat,
does eagerly long for the cooling Springs Her Soul was deeply wounded with the
&s;ting of her Sins, it &s;tuck &s;o fa&s;t that &s;he could not get it out,
therefore with the woun|ded Deer &s;he comes to the Soveraign <HI>Dittany</HI>
to expel it; the Pool of her Con&s;cience was troubled, and with the
de&s;cending Angel in&s;tantly &s;he &s;teps in for a Cure; for <HI>ut cognovit
venit,</HI> as &s;oon as &s;he knew where <HI>Je&s;us</HI> was, &s;he makes
ha&s;te to him; And the Zeal with which &s;he approacheth <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is
very remark|able. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was at Dinner in a Phari&s;ee's Hou&s;e,
where we may ob&s;erve by the way, that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> frequented Fea&s;ts,
and we do not find he was ever invited to any Table and refus'd it; if a
Phari&s;ee or a Publican invited him, he made no difficulty to go, the end of
his going in|deed was not to Eat, but to gain Souls to God, and to fulfill the
Will of his Father, which was his <HI>Meat</HI> and <HI>Drink:</HI> And at
who&s;e Table did <HI>Je&s;us</HI> ever Eat, and left not the <HI>Ho&s;t</HI> a
Gainer? When <HI>Zachaeus</HI> entertain'd him, Salvation came 
<PB N="154" REF="193"> that Day to his Hou&s;e, with the Author of it; and now
when this Phari&s;ee en|tertain'd him, his Table was honour'd with the publick
Remi&s;&s;ion of a Penitent Sinner. But how comes this Woman to thru&s;t her
&s;elf into this Phari&s;ee's Hou&s;e? Certainly great was her Faith, &s;ince
no Di&s;advantage could affright her from coming to <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> not the
Frowns, nor the Cen&s;ure of a rigid Ho&s;t, who darted from his Eyes Di&s;dain
and Scorn, &s;eeing &s;o notorious a <HI>Strumpet</HI> come to the Upper
Chamber where he entertain'd his Company, and that too in <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s
Pre&s;ence, who knew her wicked Life, and (no doubt) was offended at her
Action. A <HI>Phari&s;ee</HI>'s Hou&s;e might have &s;eem'd indeed an unlikely
Place to find a <HI>Saviour</HI> in, and it was very improper to &s;erve in
Tears at a Banquet: Certainly the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> mov'd on the Waters:
Doubtle&s;s this Woman had heard from our <HI>Saviour</HI>'s Lips, in his
Heavenly Ser|mons, many gracious Invitations of all di&s;tre&s;s'd and
&s;in-burthen'd Souls, and now at length &s;he was entangl'd in the Net of his
Heavenly Doctrine: For our <HI>Saviour</HI> (as St. <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tom</HI>
&s;ays) hath two &s;orts of Nets, a one of Wonders, ano|ther of Words; in the
former of the&s;e he caught tho&s;e many that believ'd on <PB N="155" REF="194"> his Name; by the latter he inclos'd his very Enemies, even tho&s;e
very Officers that were &s;ent to apprehend him, and bring him before the
<HI>High Prie&s;t</HI>; and &s;till doth our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour &s;pin out the
Thread of his Love, to an infinite Length, to try whether we will lay hold on
it. He doth angle for us, he &s;its in <HI>Heaven,</HI> lets down the Line of
his Love, and Baits it with his <HI>Mercy,</HI> to &s;ee whe|ther we will
&s;wallow it, that he may catch our Souls; with &s;uch a Hook was this Woman
taken, &s;he had trea&s;ur'd up his Sayings in her Memory, &s;he had
ob|&s;erv'd that he not only pardon'd Sinners, but receiv'd them into his
Pre&s;ence, &s;he had ob&s;erv'd the Pa&s;&s;ages of his Power and Mercy, and a
deep Remor&s;e wrought in her &s;elf, for her mi&s;pent Life; and &s;urely, had
not the Spirit of God wrought upon her, ere &s;he came, &s;he had neither
&s;ought nor found <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> For tho&s;e good Graces which
<HI>God</HI> finds in us, are like the Silver which <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> found in
<HI>Ben|jamin</HI>'s Sack, of his own putting in. If his Hand does not move the
golden <HI>Cym|bal,</HI> it will give no plea&s;ant Sound, for our Will herein
is like a lower Sphere, which receives its Motions from &s;ome fir&s;t Mover.
And we may believe, the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> fir&s;t breath'd, and then that 
<PB N="156" REF="195"> Bla&s;t begat the Shower of Tears which <HI>Mary</HI>
pour'd out; for fir&s;t; Thus &s;he be|ing fir&s;t mov'd by the <HI>Spirit of

into his Pre&s;ence not empty handed, but with a precious Con|fection of
<HI>Ointment</HI> of <HI>Nardus,</HI> the chief of all Ointments, which &s;he
intended to be&s;tow; this delicate odoriferous Per|fume, &s;he brings in as
rich a Ve&s;&s;el, a <HI>Box of Alabla&s;ter</HI>; &s;he u&s;ed likewi&s;e a
good <HI>Decorum,</HI> &s;he did not pre&s;ently pour out her Ointment upon the
Feet of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>; but (ob&s;erving a decent Or|der in her Repentance,
and in this her laudable Action) fir&s;t &s;he gives the Sa|crifice of a broken
Heart, &s;he &s;tood be|hind at <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Feet, her Eyes
&s;uffici|ently te&s;tified her godly Sorrow, which dropp'd down Tears as
fa&s;t as the <HI>Ara|bian</HI> Trees their medicinal Gums: She wept &s;o
plentifully, that with tho&s;e Streams of Penitence &s;he began to wa&s;h his
Feet, and did wipe them with the Hairs of her Head, to &s;hew her Abje|ction or
Neglect of her &s;elf: Thus cun|ningly in Aba&s;ement of her &s;elf does this
humble Penitent, like the <HI>Syrophe|nitian</HI> Woman, like a Dog, lick her
Ma&s;ter's Feet; at the Feet of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;he makes a general
Sacrifice of all tho&s;e <PB N="157" REF="196"> Things wherewith &s;he had
offended him: <HI>Quot habuit in &s;e oblectamenta, tot de &s;e fecit
Holocau&s;ta.</HI></P>
<Q> 
<L>Peccavit meretrix oculis, labri&s;que, co|mi&s;que,</L> 
<L>Inde luunt crimen lumina, labra, comae.</L></Q>
<P>Her Eyes, her Lips, her Hair, her Ointment, all the In&s;truments of
her Sin, were turn'd at her Conver&s;ion into the Means of Life; as the
<HI>I&s;raelites</HI> that gave their Jewels to the making of a <HI>Calf,</HI>
did afterwards be&s;tow them upon the <HI>Lord's</HI> Tabernacle; &s;uch was
this Woman's Practice, who having now ta|ken leave of her former Vanities, and
di&s;rob'd her &s;elf of all her rich Orna|ments, does, like an excellent
<HI>Apothe|cary,</HI> that knows how to mix his Me|dicines, make a mo&s;t
&s;overaign <HI>Antidote</HI> out of a mo&s;t deadly <HI>Poi&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>She u&s;ed to &s;end forth her alluring Beams into the Eyes of the
la&s;civious <HI>Paramours,</HI> therefore from her Eyes flow a Deluge of
Tears, &s;hallow enough to bear the Ark of her Sorrow; &s;he had made her Lips
the Incitements to Lu&s;t, and Inlets to Vanity, but now they &s;an|ctifie
them&s;elves with their Re&s;pect to the <HI>Son</HI> of <HI>God</HI>; her
Hair, which &s;he had <PB N="158" REF="197"> &s;o often curl'd at her Gla&s;s,
doth now &s;erve for a Towel to dry his Feet; her odoriferous Perfume,
wherewith &s;he u&s;ed to make her &s;elf acceptable to her amorous Companions,
&s;he be&s;tows on tho&s;e &s;acred Feet which her Eyes had watered, her Hair
dried, and her Mouth ki&s;&s;ed. And this &s;trange Circum&s;tance of her
anointing was &s;carce done to any but <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> nor to him but by
this Wo|man: It was e&s;teemed &s;o great an Exta|&s;ie of Love and Adoration,
that to a|noint the Feet even of the greate&s;t <HI>Mo|narch,</HI> was long
unknown in all the Pomps and Greatne&s;s of the <HI>Roman</HI> Pro|digality. It
was not us'd (as <HI>Pliny</HI> &s;ays in his natural Hi&s;tory) till
<HI>Otho</HI> taught it <HI>Nero,</HI> in who&s;e In&s;tance it was by
<HI>Pliny</HI> reckon'd for a Prodigy of unnece&s;|&s;ary Profu&s;ion, and in
it &s;elf it was a Pre&s;ent for a <HI>Prince,</HI> and <HI>an Alabla&s;ter
Box</HI> of Nard Pi&s;tick was &s;ent as a great Pre&s;ent from
<HI>Camby&s;es</HI> to the King of <HI>Aethiopia.</HI></P>
<P>But was the Oyntment &s;o precious, and &s;he &s;o poor that &s;he
could not bring a Napkin? certainly &s;he wanted not fine Linnen to have dry'd
Chri&s;t's Feet with; but to &s;hew her hearty Devotion, and &s;incere
Humility, her Shame, her Tears, her godly Sortow were not enough, &s;he 
<PB N="159" REF="198"> &s;till &s;eeks farther to make her &s;elf more vile,
and of no Price before <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>; &s;he her &s;elf is the Servant that
waits on him; from her &s;elf do fall the Dews of Water that wa&s;h his Feet;
and as her Eyes were the <HI>Ewer,</HI> &s;o her Hairs were the <HI>Towel,</HI>
u&s;ing the chiefe&s;t Ornament of her Head in the meane&s;t Office of our
Saviour's Feet; and thus &s;he &s;eems to climb up towards Heaven by the &s;ame
Rounds of that Ladder by which &s;he was formerly going down to Hell.</P>
<P>When <HI>Simon</HI> the <HI>Phari&s;ee</HI> ob&s;erved this Woman
&s;o bu&s;y in the Expre&s;&s;ion of her <HI>Religion</HI> and Veneration of
<HI>Je&s;us,</HI> he thought within him&s;elf, this was no <HI>Prophet</HI>
that did not know her to be a <HI>Sinner,</HI> and that would &s;uffer her to
touch him. For altho' the <HI>Jews</HI> Reli|gion did permit the Harlots of
their own Nation to live and enjoy all the Privileges of their Nation, except
only that their Oblations were refus'd: Yet the Phari&s;ees (who pretended to a
greater Degree of Sanctity than others) would not permit them to civil
U&s;ages, or Be|nefits of ordinary Society, and thought Religion it &s;elf and
the Honour of a Prophet was concern'd in the &s;ame Su|per&s;titiou&s;ne&s;s.
And therefore <HI>Simon</HI> made an Objection within him&s;elf, which 
<PB N="160" REF="199"> <HI>Je&s;us</HI> knowing (who under&s;tood his Thoughts
as well as his Words) made an Apology for her and him&s;elf by a civil
Que&s;tion, expre&s;s'd by way of Pa|rable of two Debtors, to whom a grea|ter
and a &s;maller Debt re&s;pectively was forgiven, both of them concluding, that
they would love their merciful Creditor in Proportion to his Mercy; which was
<HI>Mary Magdalen</HI>'s Ca&s;e, who becau&s;e &s;he had much forgiven, loved
much, and expre&s;s'd it in Characters &s;o large, that the <HI>Phari&s;ee</HI>
might read his own Inci|vility and unho&s;pitable Entertainment of the
<HI>Ma&s;ter,</HI> when it &s;tood confron|ted with the Magnificency of
<HI>Mary Mag|dalen</HI>'s Charity and Penance, the la&s;t of which &s;he
&s;ufficiently expre&s;s'd by her Tears.</P>
<P>Such is <HI>God</HI>'s Goodne&s;s, that he hath placed in the Eye
both the Di&s;ea&s;e and the Cure, the Faculty of Seeing, and the Sluce of
Tears, that they who of|fend by Seeing, may be recover'd by Weeping.
<HI>Tears</HI> are the Favourites, that have the Ear of the <HI>King</HI> of
<HI>Hea|ven</HI>; they are our Bills of <HI>Exchange</HI> which he allows, and
returns them with what Sums of Ble&s;&s;ings we de&s;ire; &s;o long as we pay
him this Type of our Devotion, &s;o long is our Tenure &s;afe, 
<PB N="161" REF="200"> and our Title to his Goodne&s;s and Mercy
unque&s;tionable.</P>
<P>This Soveraign Water will recal a Sinner to the Life of Grace, tho'
never &s;o far gone. The&s;e heavenly Showers are the Streams of
<HI>Jordan</HI> which cure our <HI>Lepro&s;ie,</HI> the <HI>Silim</HI> to cure
our Blind|ne&s;s, the <HI>Bethe&s;da</HI> to heal our Lamene&s;s and Defects of
Obedience; never was the Poy&s;on of any Sin &s;o cold, but the Hand of
Repentance could thaw it; never was the Flame of any Sin &s;o hot, but the
Tears of Repentance could cool it: <HI>Magis frugiferae Lacrymantes
vineae.</HI> The bleeding Heart, like the dropping Vine, is for the mo&s;t Part
fruitful. I cannot here expre&s;s my Thoughts of <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI>'s Tears

<P>Among&s;t other Things ob&s;ervable in the greater and more &s;olemn

their whole Body, &s;ome|times by Ki&s;&s;ing the Feet, as in this
Pa&s;|&s;age, and commonly by an ordinary Ki&s;s of the Cheek, as a Pledge of
their wel|come to their Gue&s;t. The <HI>Second</HI> was the Wa&s;hing of their
Feet before they &s;at down to Eat. The <HI>Third</HI> Compli|ment was pouring
Oil upon the Head. In all which Ob&s;ervances, <HI>Simon</HI> (tho' of the
formal Sect of the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI>) <PB N="163" REF="202"> was defective.
In&s;omuch that our <HI>Sa|viour</HI> taxes him of this neglected Office in his
Entertainment, <HI>Thou gave&s;t me no Water for my Feet,</HI> &amp;c. And well
might the <HI>Phari&s;ee</HI> read his own Fault in the Prai&s;e

<P>To Repent then is to Ki&s;s the Feet of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> and it is
all one to be &s;orry for our Sins, and to love <HI>him</HI>; this is confirm'd
by our <HI>Saviour</HI>'s Words, who denomi|nates this whole Action from
<HI>Love. Chri&s;t</HI> &s;ays not, &s;he <HI>wept</HI> much, &s;he
<HI>&s;or|row'd</HI> much, but &s;he <HI>lov'd</HI> much, and by all means
&s;he &s;ought to expre&s;s her great Love, which great Mercy rais'd. For
nothing &s;he had was too dear, with her mo&s;t precious and fragrant Ointment
&s;he anointed our <HI>Saviour</HI>'s Feet, that rich and co&s;tly Te&s;timony
of her Love &s;he be&s;tow'd freely, for &s;he did not <HI>drop</HI> but
<HI>pour,</HI> not a <HI>Dram</HI> or <HI>two</HI> but a <HI>whole Pound,</HI>
not re&s;erving any, but breaking the Box, and pouring it all out: What went
before was the Sacrifice of a broken Heart, with that fir&s;t Sacrifice &s;he
ador'd the Divinity of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> this la&s;t &s;he tendreth to his
Humanity: The <PB N="164" REF="203"> fir&s;t Shower of her Tears were Tears of
<HI>Sorrow</HI> and <HI>Repentance</HI>; the latter, which overtook the
fir&s;t, were Tears of <HI>Joy</HI> and <HI>Love.</HI> And &s;o plea&s;ing to
<HI>Chri&s;t</HI> were all the Actions of this perfect Pe|nitent, that he not
only defended her again&s;t the <HI>Phari&s;ee,</HI> in preferring her
Kindne&s;s to the Entertainment of his Hou&s;e; but again&s;t <HI>Satan</HI>
and the Powers of Hell, in forgiving her many Sins with|out any Enumeration of
them. This is the Sub&s;tance of what pa&s;&s;ed betwixt <HI>Je&s;us</HI> and
<HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> in the Pha|ri&s;ee's Hou&s;e; but I cannot leave this
happy Convert there, but mu&s;t follow her to <HI>Bethany,</HI> to &s;ee her

<P><HI>Je&s;us</HI> having left <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> in the 3d Year of
his Publick Mini&s;try, after he had Wept over it, he came to <HI>Bethany,</HI>

de&s;ir'd <HI>Je&s;us</HI> to di&s;mi&s;s her Si|&s;ter <HI>Mary</HI> from his

Words of God, unmindful of providing for his Entertainment; But 
<PB N="165" REF="204"> <HI>Je&s;us</HI> commended her Choice, and tho' he did
not expre&s;ly refu&s;e <HI>Martha</HI>'s Ci|vility, yet he preferr'd
<HI>Mary</HI>'s Religion. Here <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> (who had &s;pent before
one Box of <HI>Nard Pi&s;tick</HI> upon our <HI>Lord</HI>'s Feet as a Sacrifice
for her Conver&s;ion) now be&s;tow'd another in Thankfulne&s;s in re&s;toring
her Brother <HI>Lazarus</HI> to Life, and con&s;ign'd her <HI>Lord</HI> to his
Burial; and here too &s;he met with an evil Interpreter, <HI>Judas</HI> an
<HI>Apo&s;tle,</HI> one of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s own Family, pretended it had
been better to have given it to the Poor; but it was <HI>Malice</HI> and the
Spirit of Envy that &s;poke, not Religion. For he that &s;ees an Action well
done, and &s;eeks to undervalue it, by telling how it might have been done
better, reproves nothing but his own Spirit; For a Man may do very well, and
<HI>God</HI> will accept it, tho' to &s;ay he might have done bet|ter, is to
&s;ay only, that Action was not the mo&s;t ab&s;olute and perfect in it's Kind;
but the End of that Man be&s;t &s;hew'd his pre&s;ent Meaning; and at the
be&s;t it could be no other than a ra&s;h Judgment of the Action and Intent of
<HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> and by his declaiming again&s;t her he made tacite
Reflections upon his <HI>Lord</HI> for &s;uffering it; and yet it is not
intima|ted <PB N="166" REF="205"> in the Hi&s;tory of the Life of
<HI>Je&s;us,</HI> that <HI>Judas</HI> had any Malice again&s;t the Per&s;on of
<HI>Chri&s;t</HI>; for when afterwards he &s;aw the Matter was to end in the
Death of the Lord, he repented; but a ba&s;e unworthy Spirit of
Covetou&s;ne&s;s po&s;&s;e&s;s'd him, and the Relicks of Indig|nation for
mi&s;&s;ing the Price of the Oint|ment burnt in his Bowels, with a &s;ecret
dark melancholy Fire, and broke out into an Action which all Ages of the World
could never Parallel: <HI>To what end was this wa&s;te of Ointment,</HI> &s;ays
<HI>Judas, for it might have been &s;old for more than Three hundred Pence, and
been given to the Poor</HI>; but <HI>Je&s;us</HI> &s;aid, <HI>Let her alone,
why trouble you her, &s;he hath wrought a good work on me.</HI></P>
<P>As this was well intended, it was well taken by <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI>
and approv'd of by all pre&s;ent except <HI>Judas,</HI> who liking his own Gain
better than any Scent in the <HI>Apothecaries</HI> Shop, &s;eeing that &s;pent
on his Ma&s;ter's Head, which he wi&s;h'd in his own Pur&s;e, grumbled at it;
and that with &s;o colourable a Pretence, that it was a needle&s;s Expence, a
Wa&s;te, and that it might have been be&s;tow'd much better for the Relief of
the <HI>Poor,</HI> as that <HI>Judas</HI> drew &s;ome of the
<HI>Di&s;ciples</HI> to favour the Motion, and to di&s;like 
<PB N="167" REF="206"> <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> and her Action; &s;o that both
they and he joyn'd in one Bill; but he of wretched Covetou&s;ne&s;s of Mind,
and they of a &s;imple plain Intent and Purpo&s;e, thinking all that was
well|&s;poken was well-meant; &s;o that the Action was not brought only
again&s;t her that be&s;tow'd it, but again&s;t <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> that admitted
it. Whereupon he pleads her Cau&s;e, not only excu&s;ing her, but com|mending
it as a good Work And yet the Ointment was not &s;o plea&s;ing to his Sen&s;e
as her Gratitude was to his Spirit; for he then declar'd, that the Ointment
which fill'd the Hou&s;e with the Scent, &s;hould fill the whole World with the
Report of it; and as far as the Go&s;pel &s;hould be preach'd, &s;o far
&s;hould the Remembrance of her Action reach, as well for her Commendation, as
for our Imitation.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee Things well done are oftentimes ill taken, and often
good In|tentions want good Con&s;tructions. No Per&s;on had &s;uch Experience
of this as <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI>: The Scripture records three &s;everal
Virtues of hers, and in each of them &s;he was murmur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d at. When in the Bitterne&s;s of her Soul, &s;he
&s;hew'd her Repentance by Tears, <HI>Simon</HI> the <HI>Pha|ri&s;ee</HI> did
what he could to Di&s;grace her: <PB N="168" REF="207"> When &s;itting at
<HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Feet, <HI>Martha</HI> her Si&s;ter complain'd of her to
<HI>Chri&s;t</HI>; and now here again the third Time, when in an hone&s;t
regard of her Duty, &s;he's &s;hewing her Thankfulne&s;s for Com|fort receiv'd,
<HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s own Di&s;ciple &s;peaks again&s;t her. So that if &s;he
wa&s;hes <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Feet with Tears it contents not, if &s;he anoints
his Head with Balm its Matter of Di&s;plea&s;ure, and if &s;he Sits &s;till and
&s;ays nothing, 'tis all one, &s;till <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> is in Fault, her
Doings ever &s;tand awry: This is the Fortune of all that follow her Steps;
even <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> him&s;elf could neither have his Feet a|nointed, but
<HI>Simon</HI> the <HI>Phari&s;ee,</HI> nor his Head anointed, but
<HI>Judas</HI> his Apo|&s;tle, &s;peaks again&s;t it.</P>
<P>But we mu&s;t not leave <HI>Mary Mag|dalen</HI> here; for
notwith&s;tanding the&s;e great Di&s;couragements and Rebukes, which &s;he
receiv'd from <HI>Judas</HI> and &s;ome of the Di&s;ciples, &s;he neglected not
her Duty, nor left her <HI>Lord</HI> till his Death; for loving
<HI>Chri&s;t</HI> more than her Life, &s;he followed him in his Journey to his
Death, attending him when his Di&s;ci|ples fled, being more willing to Die with
him, than to Live without him. She was la&s;t at his Cro&s;s, and fir&s;t at
his Grave, &s;taid longe&s;t there, and was <PB N="169" REF="208"> &s;oone&s;t
here; &s;he could not re&s;t till &s;he was up to &s;eek him, &s;ought him
before the Day lighted her; &s;he &s;tood by the Grave, where faint Love u&s;es
not to <HI>&s;tand</HI>; we bring our Friends to the Grave, and there leave
them, but come no more at it, nor &s;tay longer by it; but <HI>Mary
Magdalen</HI> did, and &s;he only and none but &s;he, as we &s;hall &s;ee by
the Se|quel of this Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>We find in the whole Tenour of the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> that God
ob&s;erves a mixture of much &s;piritual Power and Glory, with much outward
Meanne&s;s: The Go&s;pel is call'd a rich Trea&s;ure in an earthen Ve&s;&s;el;
the My&s;tery conveyed is preci|ous, but the Means of Conveyance mean and
contemptible; The whole My&s;tery of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is made up of Power and
Meekne&s;s; his Conception was by the Holy Gho&s;t, of a pure Virgin, but the
out-&s;ide Mean, his Ble&s;&s;ed Mother, an Earthen Ve&s;&s;el, the Spou&s;e of
a poor <HI>Carpenter</HI>; his Birth publi&s;h'd by an Angel, but di&s;cover'd
fir&s;t to poor Shep|herds; his Lodging pointed out by a Star, and yet his
Cradle but a Manger, his Nur&s;ery but a Stable: Being in the Wilderne&s;s he
was attended by Angels; but &s;ee the poor Out-&s;ide, he was a|mong&s;t wild
Bea&s;ts; in his Agony he <PB N="700" REF="209"> was full of Trembling and
Horror, but then he receiv'd Comfort from Heaven by an Angel; at his Death he
was Cru|cified with Thieves, but yet the Powers of <HI>Heaven</HI> and
<HI>Earth</HI> trembled at it: The Tidings of his Re&s;urrection were told by
an Angel, but &s;pread through the World by poor weak Women. Had Fle&s;h and
Blood had the Management of the News of his Re&s;urrection, it would have been
fir&s;t publi&s;h'd to the College of the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> and St.
<HI>Peter</HI> &s;hould have had the fir&s;t Intelligence by a Vi&s;ion of
Angels directed to him. Kings and Princes make known their Minds to inferior
People by their <HI>Great Officers</HI> and <HI>Mini&s;ters,</HI> but the
<HI>Court of Heaven</HI> takes other Mea&s;ures. <HI>God</HI> em|ploys poor,
and in the Eye of the World, contemptible Men, to declare his Will to the
<HI>Potentates</HI> of the World: And this was the grand Objection made by the
mi&s;taken <HI>Pagans</HI> to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and his Di&s;ciples, that
<HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> was &s;et on foot by &s;uch abject and mean Per&s;ons
as <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> made choice of; but that which begat in them Contempt and
Scorn, ought to fill us with Wonder and Admiration.</P>
<P>And to make Amends for that Ob|&s;ervation, that no good Angel ever
a&s;|&s;um'd the Likene&s;s of a Woman, here <PB N="171" REF="210"> are Women
(of whom <HI>M. Magdalen</HI> was chief) made Angels, <HI>i. e.</HI> (as the
original &s;ignifies) <HI>Me&s;&s;engers</HI> and <HI>Pub|li&s;hers</HI> of the
greate&s;t My&s;tery of our Religion; for <HI>M. Magdalen,</HI> with other
devout Women, (who not con&s;idering the Re&s;urrection of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>)
went with a pious Intention to do an Office of Re|&s;pect and Honour to the
Body of their Ma&s;ter, which they meant to embalm in the Tomb, where they
thought to have found it; there was <HI>God,</HI> the <HI>God</HI> of Life,
dead and laid in a Grave, and here was <HI>Man,</HI> a <HI>dead Man</HI>
ri&s;en out of the Grave; here are <HI>Angels</HI> of <HI>Heaven</HI> employed
in &s;o low an Office as to in|&s;truct Women, and Women employ'd in &s;o high
an Office as to in&s;truct the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI>; here are <HI>angelical</HI>
Women, and <HI>evangelical Angels</HI>; Angels made <HI>Evan|geli&s;ts</HI> to
preach the Go&s;pel, and <HI>Women</HI> made <HI>Angels</HI> to be
<HI>In&s;tructors</HI> of the <HI>Church.</HI></P>
<P>Now tho' it has been doubted whe|ther the <HI>ble&s;&s;ed
Virgin</HI> was there when this pa&s;s'd at the Sepulcher, yet that <HI>Mary
Magdalen,</HI> and <HI>Mary</HI> the Mother of <HI>James</HI> and
<HI>Salmone</HI> were there is cer|tain.</P>
<P>They came to embalm the Body of Je&s;us, (for the Rights of
embalming a|mong&s;t <PB N="172" REF="211"> the <HI>Jews</HI> us'd to la&s;t
<HI>forty Days</HI>) and their Love was not &s;atisfy'd with what
<HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> had done; but herein they were very incon&s;iderate, for that
was only done upon &s;uch Bodies as were ex|tenerated and embowell'd, and then
fill'd up and plai&s;ter'd about with Spices and Gumms to pre&s;erve them from
Pu|trefaction, when they were to be carried into remote Parts; but of the&s;e
re-em|balmings, after the Body had been laid in the Sepulcher, I never read,
neither &s;eems it to have been po&s;&s;ible for the&s;e Women to have come at
the Body of <HI>Chri&s;t:</HI> And by the Winding-&s;heet of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI>
which is kept in <HI>Savoy,</HI> it appears that that Sheet &s;tuck &s;o
clo&s;e to the Body, as that it did, and does &s;till retain the Demen&s;ions
of his Body, and the Im|pre&s;&s;ions and Marks of every Wound that he receiv'd
in his Body; &s;o that it would have been no ea&s;ie Matter for the&s;e Women
to have pull'd off that Sheet, if it had been fa&s;ten'd to his Bo|dy with
nothing but his Blood: But if (as &s;ome Authors &s;ay) his Body was car|ried
loo&s;e in the Sheet which is &s;hew'd in <HI>Savoy,</HI> from the Cro&s;s to
the Sepul|cher, and then taken out of that Sheet and embalmed by
<HI>Nicodemus,</HI> and wrapp'd up in other Linnen upon tho&s;e 
<PB N="173" REF="212"> <HI>Spices</HI> and <HI>Gums</HI> which he be&s;tow'd
up|on it, and then buried according to the Manner of the <HI>Jews,</HI> who&s;e
Cu&s;tom it was to &s;wath the Bodies of the Dead, as we do Children, all over,
(for &s;o <HI>La|zarus</HI> came out bound Hand and Foot with Grave-cloaths)
how could the&s;e Women think to embalm the Body of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> &s;o
&s;wath'd and bound up as that Body was? for certainly it was the Bo|dy not the
Grave-cloaths they meant to embalm, and it &s;eems &s;trange that no one has
touch'd upon this Doubt: All Expo&s;itors make good U&s;e of their Piety and
devout Care of their dead Ma&s;ter, but of the Impo&s;&s;ibility of their
coming to the Body, of the Irregularity of their Undertaking that, and
proceeding &s;o far in that which could not po&s;&s;ibly be done, there is no
mention: Indeed <HI>Cry|&s;ologus</HI> &s;ays, <HI>&s;aeva pa&s;&s;ionis
procella tur|baverat, that a bitter Storm of Pa&s;&s;ion and Con&s;ternation
had &s;o di&s;order'd them, as that no Faculty of theirs could per|form their
right Function: &amp; praefervo&s;e caecutiebant,</HI> Earne&s;tne&s;s had &s;o
di&s;com|pos'd and amaz'd them, as they di&s;cern'd nothing clearly, nor did
nothing order|ly. Another incon&s;iderate Action of the&s;e Women was, the
removing the Stone of the <HI>Sepulcher,</HI> for they had pre|par'd 
<PB N="174" REF="213"> their Gumms, and were on the way to the
<HI>Sepulcher</HI> before they thought of that; then they &s;top, and &s;ay one
to another, <HI>who &s;hall roll away the Stone from the</HI> Sepulcher. Yet
they &s;till go on, and their Love an&s;wers the Objection, not knowing how it
&s;hould be done; but yet re&s;olving to go through all Difficulties, but never
think how they &s;hould pa&s;s the Guard that was &s;et at the Tomb. But when
they came there, they found the Guard affrighted and re|mov'd, and the Stone
roll'd away; for a little before they arriv'd there had been a great
<HI>Earthquake,</HI> and an <HI>Angel</HI> de&s;cending from <HI>Heaven</HI>
had roll'd a|way the Stone and &s;ate upon it; with the Terror of his
Appearance and the Earthquake, the Soldiers were a&s;to|ni&s;h'd, and were like
dead Men; and &s;ome of them ran to the <HI>High-Prie&s;t</HI> and told what
had happen'd: Hereup|on the Women finding the Door o|pen, enter'd into the
<HI>Sepulcher,</HI> and mi&s;&s;ing the Body of <HI>Je&s;us, M. Magda|len</HI>
ran to the <HI>Eleven Apo&s;tles,</HI> com|plaining that the Body of our
<HI>Lord</HI> was not to be found; they thought this Story the Product of a
weak and frightned Fancy; however <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John</HI> ran as

Corruption but would ri&s;e again? <HI>M. Magdalen</HI> al&s;o fell into &s;uch
another Error: For when the <HI>Angel</HI> had told her at the Sepulcher,
<HI>He is not here, for He is ri&s;en, as he &s;aid</HI>; yet when &s;he came
running to <HI>Peter,</HI> &s;he &s;aid no|thing of the
<HI>Re&s;urrection,</HI> never thought of that, but pour'd her &s;elf out in
that Lamentation, <HI>they have taken away our Lord.</HI> Whereas if &s;he had
con&s;ider'd, &s;he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have known from the Angel's Words,
that no Man had taken away the <HI>Lord,</HI> that no Man had laid him any
where el&s;e, but that by his own Power he was ri&s;en: But as in this Storm of
Pa&s;&s;ion, they left <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Promi&s;e, that he would ri&s;e,
uncon&s;ider'd, never remember'd the rolling of the Stone from the Door of the
Sepulcher, nei|ther did they con&s;ider the Impo&s;&s;ibility of coming to
<HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Body to do the Office they intended: Their Devotion was
awake, but their Con&s;ideration was not &s;o; however they did not lo&s;e all
the Benefits of their pious and devout <PB N="177" REF="216"> Intention; for
the <HI>Angel</HI> did not forbear to comfort them with, <HI>Do not ye

<HI>M. Magdalen</HI>'s Report, as they were &s;peedy in coming, and diligent in

could not find him, and fearful of farther &s;eeking, and their Departure
commends <HI>M. Magdalen</HI>'s &s;taying behind: To the Grave &s;he came
before them, from the Grave &s;he went to tell them, thither &s;he returns with
them, and there &s;he &s;tays behind them; a &s;tronger Affection fix'd her,
and &s;o fix'd her, that &s;he had not Power to re|move thence.</P>
<P>To &s;tay whil&s;t Company &s;tays that is the <HI>World</HI>'s
Love, but <HI>Peter</HI> is gone, <PB N="178" REF="217"> and <HI>John</HI> is
gone, and the <HI>Women</HI> are gone, and &s;he left alone, and to &s;tay
a|lone &s;hews con&s;tant Love. She &s;tood and wept, &s;he wi&s;h'd to find
<HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and therefore wept for his Ab&s;ence, whom &s;he dearly
lov'd whil&s;t &s;he had him, &s;he bitterly bewail'd him &s;he thought lo&s;t;
and having lo&s;t the Sight of her Life, &s;he de&s;ir'd to dwell in the dark,
chu&s;ing <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Tomb for her be&s;t home, and there &s;tood
weeping; &s;he abandon'd the Living for the Company of the Dead; and now it
&s;eems that even the dead have for&s;aken her, &s;ince the Body &s;he &s;eeks
is taken away from her: It was Love in|duc'd her to &s;tand, and Sorrow forc'd
her to weep; her Eye was watchful to &s;eek, whom her Heart mo&s;t lov'd to
en|joy; and her Feet in a Readine&s;s to run, if her Eye could chance to
e&s;pye him. But as &s;he watch'd to find her lo&s;t Lord, &s;he wept for
having lo&s;t whom &s;he had lov'd, for as fir&s;t &s;he mourn'd for the
Departure of his Soul out of his Body, &s;o now &s;he lamented the taking his
Body out of the Grave; for tho' her fir&s;t Sorrow was becau&s;e &s;he could
not enjoy him <HI>alive,</HI> yet &s;he hop'd at lea&s;t to have found him
<HI>dead</HI>; to which purpo&s;e &s;he had prepar'd her <HI>Spices,</HI> and
provided her <HI>Oyntments,</HI> to <PB N="179" REF="218"> pay him the la&s;t
Duties: And tho' <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> and <HI>Nicodemus</HI> had already
be&s;tow'd a hundred Pound of Myrrhe and Aloes, which was as well apply'd as
Art and Devotion could de&s;ire, yet &s;uch was her Love, that &s;he would have
thought a|ny Quantity too little without the Ad|dition of her own; &s;he came
therefore now intending to embalm his Corps, as &s;he had before anointed his
Feet; and as in the Spring of her Felicity &s;he had wa&s;hed his Feet with her
Tears, bewailing unto him the Death of her own Soul, &s;o now &s;he came in the
Depth of her Mi&s;ery to &s;hed them again for the Death of his Body. But when
&s;he &s;aw the Grave open'd, and the Body gone, the Labour of embalming was
prevented: But the Cau&s;e of her Tears increas'd, and tho' &s;he found no
U&s;e for the Spices, yet &s;he found how to employ her Tears, now as much
afflicted for his Lo&s;s, as be|fore &s;he had been pleas'd at his Pre&s;ence.
But &s;ince weeping without &s;earching was to no Purpo&s;e, her weeping
hin|der'd not her Inquiry, her Sorrow dull'd not her Diligence; &s;he often
&s;toop'd and look'd into the Grave, but why &s;hould &s;he now look in,
&s;ince <HI>Peter</HI> had been in the Tomb, and <HI>John</HI> had look'd in
before. However &s;he will not tru&s;t <PB N="180" REF="219"> either
<HI>Peter</HI>'s or <HI>John</HI>'s Eyes, nay &s;he will not tru&s;t her
&s;elf, &s;he will &s;u&s;pect her own Sen&s;es, &s;he will rather think &s;he
look'd not well before, than leave off looking. And thus hoping in De&s;pair,
and de&s;pairing in Hope, &s;he &s;tood at the <HI>Sepulcher</HI> without fear,
becau&s;e &s;he thought now nothing left that ought to be fear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d. But with what Hope or with what Heart
could &s;he &s;tand alone at the Tomb, when the Di&s;ciples were gone; for her
Eyes had &s;een, and <HI>Peter</HI>'s Hands had felt, that the <HI>Lord</HI>
was not there; the empty Winding-&s;heet did al&s;o confirm it, and yet nothing
could make her be|lieve it; her di&s;appointed Love had drown'd both her Mind
and Memory &s;o deep in Sorrow, and &s;o amaz'd her Sen&s;es by his Ab&s;ence,
that all remem|brance of his former Promi&s;es was di|verted with the Crowd of
pre&s;ent Trou|bles; for doubtle&s;s, had &s;he remember'd him, as &s;he
&s;hould have done, &s;he would not have thought the Tomb a fit Place to &s;eek
him in, neither would &s;he have mourn'd for him as dead, and remov'd by the
Treachery of others, but joy'd in him, as reviv'd by his own Power; but Sorrow
had quite &s;tupify'd her Sen&s;es, di&s;temper'd her Thoughts, di&s;courag'd
her Hopes, awak'd her Pa&s;&s;ions, and left <PB N="181" REF="220"> her no
other liberty than to weep, &s;he wept therefore; and as &s;he was weep|ing,
&s;he &s;toop'd down, and look'd into the <HI>Sepulcher,</HI> and &s;aw two
Angels in White, one at the Head, and the other at the Feet, where the Body of
<HI>Je&s;us</HI> had been laid: Angels in a Grave! a &s;trange Sight! never
&s;een before: That &s;ure was a Place fitter for Worms than Angels. They were
in White too, a Co|lour expre&s;&s;ive of Joy, <HI>Heaven</HI> mourn'd at his
<HI>Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> the Eclip&s;e of that Day &s;hew'd them all in Black, but
at the <HI>Re|&s;urrection</HI> they rejoyce, they are now all in White, even
the Heavens and Angels. They were &s;itting, the one at the Head, the other at
the Feet, which may be re|ferr'd to <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI>'s having anoin|ted
his Head and his Feet, they &s;at at the&s;e two Places, as it were to
acknow|ledge &s;o much for her Sake: Between the <HI>Angels</HI> there was no
&s;triving for Places; he that &s;at at the <HI>Feet</HI> was as well
con|tented, as he that &s;at at the <HI>Head</HI>; but with us, both Angels
would have been at the Head, never a one at the Feet: <HI>And they &s;aid unto
her, Woman, why weepe&s;t thou?</HI> They ask'd her, Why &s;he wept? believing
&s;he had no Cau&s;e, all was in Error, Tears of Grief, but fal&s;e Grief,
imagining him to be dead that was <PB N="182" REF="221"> alive; &s;he wept
becau&s;e &s;he found the Grave empty, which, God forbid, &s;he &s;hould have
found full, for then <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> mu&s;t have been dead &s;till; for want
of Belief in his Re&s;urrection, &s;he believ'd he was carried away; &s;he
err'd in &s;o be|lieving; there was Error in her <HI>Love,</HI> but there was
Love in her Error; and it was a great Argument of her Love, to call him
<HI>Lord,</HI> after he had &s;uffer'd the mo&s;t opprobrious and ignominious
Death, &s;uch as would have made many blu&s;h to own him.</P>
<P>When &s;he look'd fir&s;t &s;he &s;aw no An|gel, and then of a
&s;udden looking down, &s;he &s;aw two; yet the &s;uddenne&s;s and
gloriou&s;ne&s;s of the Sight mov'd her not at all, &s;he &s;eem'd to have no
Sen&s;e of it, but wept on, which was &s;trange; for here methinks her good
Fortune exceeds her Hopes, and where her la&s;t Sorrow was bred, her fir&s;t
Succour ari&s;es, for &s;he &s;ought but one, and &s;he found two; one dead
Body was the Cau&s;e of her Errand, and &s;he found two alive; her Weeping was
for a Man, and her Tears have found Angels, who invite her to a Parly, and
&s;eem to pity her Ca&s;e. They &s;it at the Tomb, to &s;hew they are no
Strangers to her Lo&s;s, they &s;pake to her, as tho' they had &s;ome &s;pecial
Me&s;&s;age to <PB N="183" REF="222"> deliver to her; and if &s;he had ask'd
them concerning her Ma&s;ter, they were the likelie&s;t to give her a
&s;atisfactory An|&s;wer, and to have told her the Cau&s;e of their coming, and
the Rea&s;on of her <HI>Lord</HI>'s remove; but nothing could move her to admit
Comfort, or to entertain any Company, for having vow'd her &s;elf to
<HI>Chri&s;t</HI> alone, except to him, &s;he will neither lend her Ear, nor
borrow others Help: Be&s;ides, whatever they could tell her, if they told her
not of him, and what&s;oever they told her of him, if they told her not where
he was, both their telling, and her hearing, were but a wa&s;ting of Time; for
&s;he came not thither to &s;ee Angels, but him who made both her and them, and
to whom &s;he ow'd more than to Men and Angels; and being full of wavering
Uncertain|ties, and perplex'd Thoughts, &s;he be|gan to think, if &s;he &s;taid
there by the Tomb where he was not, &s;he &s;hould never find him; and if &s;he
would go farther to &s;eek, &s;he knew not whither; to part with the Tomb was
Death to her, and to &s;tand helple&s;s by it would do no good; &s;o that all
her Comfort was, that &s;he mu&s;t either &s;tay there with|out Help, or go
without Hope: Then &s;he blam'd her &s;elf, for leaving him when 
<PB N="184" REF="223"> &s;he had him, thus to lament him now &s;he had lo&s;t
him, and for departing when it was time to &s;tay, and returning when it was
too late to Help; forget|ting what her Ma&s;ter u&s;ed to &s;ay, when he told
her, <HI>He would ri&s;e again the third Day:</HI> But why doth &s;he torment
her &s;elf with the&s;e tragical Surmi&s;es? Does &s;he think the
<HI>Angels</HI> would &s;it &s;till if their <HI>God</HI> were not well, did
they &s;erve him after his Fa&s;ting, and would they de&s;pi&s;e him after his
Decea&s;e? If in the Garden he might have had Twelve Legions of An|gels, (as he
&s;aid) Is his Power &s;o gone with the Life of his Body, that he could not now
Command them? Was there an Angel found to help <HI>Daniel</HI> to his Dinner,
to &s;ave <HI>Toby</HI> from the Fi&s;h, and to defend <HI>Balaam</HI>'s poor
Bea&s;t from his Ma&s;ter's Rage? And is the <HI>Lord</HI> of <HI>An|gels</HI>
of &s;o little Concern, that if his Body wanted it, no Angel would defend it?
But &s;he &s;aw two there to Honour his <HI>Tomb</HI>; and how much more
careful would they be to do Homage to his Per&s;on? She might well think they
would not Smile, if &s;he had ju&s;t Occa|&s;ion to Weep, they would not &s;o
glori|ou&s;ly &s;it in white, if a black and mourn|ing Weed did better become
them.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="224">But why did her Sorrow que&s;tion &s;o much
about the Place where they had laid her <HI>Lord?</HI> might not &s;he better
&s;up|po&s;e, that he was in <HI>Paradi&s;e</HI>; for &s;ince he came to repair
<HI>Adam</HI>'s Ruins, and to be the <HI>common Parent</HI> of our Redem|ption,
as <HI>Adam</HI> was of our Original In|fection, 'twas rea&s;onable, that
having en|dur'd all his Life the Penalty of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Exile, he &s;hould
after Death re-enter upon a Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that Inheritance which
<HI>Adam</HI> lo&s;t. And be&s;ides, if her Sorrow at the Cro&s;s had not made
her as Deaf, as at the Tomb it made her Forgetful, &s;he could not but have
re|member'd what he him&s;elf &s;aid to one of the <HI>Thieves, That the &s;ame
Day he &s;hould be with him in</HI> Paradi&s;e.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> thus lo&s;t her &s;elf in a
Labyrinth of Doubts, mixing Tears with her Words, and warming them with Sighs,
&s;he &s;aw the Angels with a kind of Reverence as tho' they had done Honour to
one behind her; whereupon &s;he turn'd back and &s;aw <HI>Je|&s;us</HI>
&s;tanding, but knew not that it was <HI>him.</HI> For when <HI>Je&s;us</HI>
&s;aw that nothing would give her Comfort but him&s;elf, that no
<HI>Angels,</HI> no Sight, no Speech of others would &s;erve, then her
<HI>Lord</HI> comes, and from &s;eeking him dead, &s;he <PB N="186" REF="225">
finds him alive; but fir&s;t he comes un|known, &s;tands by her, and &s;he did
not &s;u&s;pect that it was he; &s;he not only knew not that 'twas
<HI>Je&s;us,</HI> but mi&s;took him for the <HI>Gardiner:</HI> Proper enough it
was, and fitted well with the Time and Place, it was the Spring, and in a
Garden, and &s;he did not mi&s;take in taking him for a <HI>Gardiner,</HI> tho'
&s;he might &s;eem to err in &s;ome Sen&s;e; yet in another Sen&s;e &s;he was
in the right: For in a Spiritual Sen&s;e, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> may be &s;aid to be
a Gar|diner, for of the fir&s;t the faire&s;t Garden that ever was,
<HI>Paradi&s;e,</HI> he was the Gar|diner, it was of his Planting, and ever
&s;ince it is he that makes all our <HI>Gardens</HI> Green, &s;ends us Yearly
the Spring, and all the <HI>Herbs</HI> and <HI>Flowers</HI> we gather in the
Sea&s;on: And 'tis he that gardens our Souls too, and weeds out of them
what&s;oever is prejudicial to or de&s;tru|ctive of his Word &s;own in our
Hearts. He &s;ows them with the true Roots of all <HI>Chri&s;tian Virtues,</HI>
waters them with the Dew of his Grace, and makes them bring forth Fruit to
<HI>Eternal Life.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides all this, Chri&s;t on the Day of his Re&s;urrection was
mo&s;t properly a Gar|diner, and that a &s;trange One, who made &s;uch an Herb
grow out of the Ground that Day, as the like was never &s;een be|fore, 
<PB N="187" REF="226"> (except in the In&s;tance of <HI>Laza|rus</HI> rais'd by

<P>But was it po&s;&s;ible that <HI>Mary Magda|len</HI> could forget
<HI>Je&s;us,</HI> who&s;e Faith had fix'd him in her Under&s;tanding, her Love
in her Will, both Fear and Hope in her Memory, for him her Eye weeps, her
Thoughts greive, her whole <HI>Body</HI> fainteth, her Soul langui&s;heth, and
there was no Part of her that was not bu&s;ie about him; and yet &s;he had
forgotten him; his Countenance and Voice a&s;&s;ure her, his Words witne&s;s
it, her Eyes be|hold him, and yet &s;he knew him not: But there was &s;uch a
Shower of Tears between her and him, and her Eyes were &s;o dimm'd with weeping
for him, that tho' &s;he &s;aw the Man, &s;he could not di&s;cern
<HI>Je&s;us</HI>; and therefore as he &s;eems to her a Stranger, he asketh the
&s;ame Que&s;tion of her which the Angels had, only quickens it a little with
<HI>Woman why weepe&s;t thou, whom &s;eeke&s;t thou?</HI> If &s;he &s;eeks
<HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> why knows &s;he him not? and if &s;he knows him, why does
&s;he &s;eek him whom &s;he &s;ees? It is a common thing with us to &s;eek a
Thing, and when we have found it, not to know we have.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="227">Scarce three Days ago &s;he &s;aw him hanging
on a Tree with his Head crown'd with Thorns, his Eyes full of Sorrow, his Ears
fill'd with Bla&s;phemies, his Mouth fed with Gall, his whole Per&s;on mangled
and disfigur'd, his Arms and Legs rack'd with violent Pulls, his Hands and Feet
boar'd with Nails, his Side wounded with a Spear, his whole Body torn with
Scourges and goar'd with Blood; and yet Chri&s;t asketh her, <HI>Why &s;he
weeps?</HI> and not without Cau&s;e doth he ask this Que&s;tion, becau&s;e
&s;he would have <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> alive, and yet wept becau&s;e &s;he did not
find him dead: She was &s;orry he was not there, and for that very Cau&s;e
&s;he &s;hould rather have been glad; for if he were Dead &s;he might have
expected to &s;ee him there, but his not being there was a &s;ign he was Alive:
But &s;he &s;till taking <HI>Je&s;us</HI> to be the Gardiner, &s;aid unto him,
<HI>If thou ha&s;t carried him from hence, tell me where thou ha&s;t laid him,

it was &s;afe, even when we &s;eek <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> to pray <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>
to help us to find <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> for we cannot come to him ex|cept he
draws us: But <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> &s;eems &s;omething more har&s;h to
<HI>Chri&s;t</HI> <PB N="189" REF="228"> than to the Angels, to them &s;he
com|plains of <HI>others,</HI> &s;aying, <HI>they</HI> have taken him away: But
&s;he &s;eems to charge <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> at lea&s;t to &s;u&s;pect him of the
Fact, as if he had look'd like one that had been a Robber of Graves; her
<HI>if</HI> im|plies as much, but Love, as it fears where it need not, &s;o it
&s;u&s;pects without Cau&s;e. But St. <HI>Bernard</HI> &s;peaks to
<HI>Chri&s;t</HI> for her: <HI>Domine amor quem habebat in Te, &amp; dolor quem
habebat de Te, excu&s;at eam apud Te, &s;i fort&egrave; erravit circa Te.</HI>
The Love &s;he bore him, the Sorrow &s;he had for him, may excu&s;e her, if
&s;he were in any Error concerning him, in her &s;ay|ing, <HI>Si
&s;u&s;tuli&s;ti.</HI> Her Affections &s;eem to tran&s;port her, (as &s;he
&s;ays) no Man knows what, to one a meer Stranger to her, and &s;he to him,
&s;he talks to one thrice under the Name of him, if thou ha&s;t taken him, tell
me where thou ha&s;t laid him, and I will fetch him; alas poor Woman, &s;he was
not able to lift him, there goes more than one or two either to the carrying of
a Corps; as for his, it had more than a Hundred Pound weight of Myrrh and other
Odours up|on it.</P>
<P>She charged not the Angels with his Removal, nor &s;eem'd to
mi&s;tru&s;t them, for &s;he did not reque&s;t them to inform 
<PB N="190" REF="229"> her where he was laid; but now &s;he judgeth the
Gardiner to be the Author of her Lo&s;s, being almo&s;t fully per&s;ua|ded,
that he was privy to the Place, and acquainted with the Action; and tho' &s;he
was not altogether in the right, yet &s;he was not much in the wrong, and err'd
with &s;uch aim, that &s;he mi&s;s'd very little of the Truth.</P>
<P>But &s;ince &s;he was &s;o de&s;irous to know where <HI>Je&s;us</HI>
lay, Why did not &s;he name him when &s;he ask'd for him? She &s;ays only &s;he
will take <HI>Him</HI> away, her Cou|rage &s;eems above the Strength of a
Wo|man, neither does &s;he remember that all Women are weak, &s;he promi&s;eth
without Condition, &s;he makes no Ex|ception, as if nothing were impo&s;&s;ible
that her Love &s;ugge&s;teth. It was indeed wonderful, that <HI>Love</HI> had
&s;o bereav'd her of Sen&s;e, that tho' &s;he &s;aw the An|gels, &s;he could
not &s;ee <HI>Je&s;us.</HI> She &s;ought for one, whom when &s;he had found
&s;he knew not; and not knowing him when &s;he found him, &s;he &s;ought for
him when &s;he had him: But alas, how could poor <HI>Mary</HI> believe, that
after her <HI>Lord</HI> had liv'd &s;o long, labour'd &s;o much, died with
&s;uch Pain, and &s;hed &s;uch &s;howers of Blood, he &s;hould come to no
higher a Preferment, than to be a <HI>Gardiner</HI>; <PB N="191" REF="230"> Was
a &s;orry Garden the be&s;t Inheri|tance her Love could have imagin'd for him,
or a <HI>Gardiner</HI>'s Office the highe&s;t Dignity &s;he could allow him? It
had been better he had liv'd to have been <HI>Lord</HI> of her Ca&s;tle of
<HI>Magdalen,</HI> than with his Death &s;o dearly to have purchas'd &s;o mean
a Po&s;t.</P>
<P>But her Mi&s;take hath in it a farther My&s;tery, tho' her Sight was
deceiv'd, &s;he thought not ami&s;s; For as our fir&s;t Father in his State of
Innocence was plac'd in a Garden of Plea&s;ure, and his fir&s;t Office was that
of a <HI>Gardiner</HI>; &s;o the fir&s;t Man that ever was in <HI>Glory,</HI>
appear'd fir&s;t in a Garden, and pre&s;ented him&s;elf in the likene&s;s of a
<HI>Gardiner,</HI> that the beginning of Glory might re|&s;emble that of
Innocence and Grace. And as that <HI>Gardiner</HI> was the foil of Mankind, the
Parent of Sin, and Au|thor of Death; &s;o this was the Rai&s;er of our Ruins,
the Ran&s;om of our Offence, and the Re&s;torer of Life. In a <HI>Garden,</HI>
Man was deceiv'd and en&s;nar'd by the Devil. In a Garden, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>
was betray'd and apprehended by the <HI>Jews.</HI> In a Garden, <HI>Adam</HI>
was condemn'd to eat his Bread in the Sweat of his Brows; And after a Free-Gift
of the Bread of Angels in the la&s;t Supper, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> did 
<PB N="192" REF="231"> earn it us, with a <HI>Bloody Sweat</HI> of his whole
Body; And as by Di&s;obedient eating the Fruit of a <HI>Tree,</HI> our Right to
the Garden of Paradi&s;e was forfeited by <HI>Adam</HI>; &s;o by the Obedient
Death of <HI>Chri&s;t upon a Tree,</HI> a far better Right is now &s;ettled;
And as when <HI>Adam</HI> &s;inn'd in the Garden of Paradi&s;e, he was then
apparell'd in the Skin of a dead Bea&s;t, that his Cloathing might betoken his
Grave, and his Livery of Death agree with his Condemnation to Die; &s;o to
defray the Debt of that Sin, in this Garden <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> lay clad in the
dead Man's Shrowd, and buried in his Tomb, that as our Evils began &s;o they
might end, and &s;uch Places and Means as were the Premi&s;es of our Mi&s;ery,
might be al&s;o the end of our Misfortune; and for the&s;e Rea&s;ons <HI>Mary
Magdalen</HI> was allow'd to mi&s;take, that we might be inform'd of the
My&s;tery, and &s;ee how aptly the Cour&s;e of our Redemption did an&s;wer the
Proce&s;s of our Condemnation.</P>
<P>But why could not <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> as well &s;ee what in truth
Chri&s;t was, as what in &s;how he &s;eem'd to be? but &s;he thought &s;o to
have found him as &s;he left him, and &s;he &s;ought him as &s;he &s;aw him
la&s;t, being &s;o overcome with Sorrow for his Death, that &s;he had neither
room <PB N="193" REF="232"> nor re&s;pite in her Mind, for any hope of his
Life, and therefore &s;he ask'd the <HI>Gardiner, If thou ha&s;t carried him
hence, tell me where thou ha&s;t laid him, and I will take him.</HI></P>
<P>But one would be ready to think her Ma&s;ter was very unkind to
leave her &s;o long without Comfort, and to puni&s;h her &s;o much, who &s;o
well de&s;erv'd Pardon: She did not follow the Tide of his bet|ter Fortune, to
&s;hift &s;ail with the Stream; &s;he left him not in his lowe&s;t Ebb, &s;he
revolted not from his la&s;t Extremity; in his Life &s;he &s;erv'd him with her
Goods, in his Death &s;he departed not from his Cro&s;s; and after Death &s;he
came to dwell with him in his Grave.</P>
<P>But now <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> begins to take Pity on her, her Tears were
too mighty Orators to let her Suit fall, tho' they pleaded at the mo&s;t
rigorous Bar, they tie the Tongues of all Accu&s;ers, and &s;often the rigour
of the &s;evere&s;t Judge, they win the Invincible, and bind the Omnipo|tent;
when they &s;eem mo&s;t Pittiful, they have the greate&s;t Power, and being
mo&s;t For&s;aken, they are more Victorious: For this Water her Heart had been
long a Limbeck, &s;ometimes di&s;tilling it from the Weeds of her own Offences,
with the true Fire of Contrition, &s;ometimes <PB N="194" REF="233"> of the
Flowers of Spiritual Comforts, with the Flames of Contemplation; and at other
times out of the bitter Herbs of her Ma&s;ter's Mi&s;eries, with the Heat of a
tender Compa&s;&s;ion. Her Tears, that were heretofore the <HI>Proctors</HI>
for her Brother's Life, were now the Invi|ters of tho&s;e Angels in the
Monument for her Comfort, and the Suiters that &s;hall be rewarded with the
fir&s;t Sight of her reviv'd Saviour. For when Chri&s;t &s;aw all was in vain,
that neither Men nor Agels, nor him&s;elf (&s;o long as he kept him&s;elf a
<HI>Gardiner</HI>) could get any Thing out of her, but that her Lord was gone,
he was taken away, and that nothing but <HI>Je&s;us</HI> could yield her any
Comfort; He is no longer able to contain, but even di&s;clo&s;es him&s;elf, and
that by his Voice; And now <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is found alive, that was &s;ought
Dead. A Cloud may be &s;o thick as to hide the Sun from our Sight, the Sun
mu&s;t &s;catter that Cloud and then we may &s;ee its Light: Here is an Example
of it: A thick Cloud of Heavine&s;s had &s;o ob&s;cured <HI>Mary
Magdalen</HI>'s Eyes, that &s;he could not &s;ee him thro' it, this one word,
the&s;e two Syllables <HI>Ma-ry</HI> from his Mouth di&s;pels all the
Darkne&s;s; no &s;ooner had his Voice &s;ounded in her Ears, but it drove away
all the Mi&s;t, dries up <PB N="195" REF="234"> her Tears, opens her Eyes, and
&s;he knows him, and an&s;wer'd him with her wonted Salutation,
<HI>Rabboni:</HI> Thus the <HI>Gardiner</HI> did his Part, brought <HI>Mary
Magdalen</HI> from a dead and drooping, to a lively and cheerful E&s;tate; She
&s;ought <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> dead and impri&s;on'd in a Stony-Grave, and finds
him both alive, and at full li|berty; She &s;ought him in a Shroud more like a
Leper than him&s;elf, left as the Model of the utmo&s;t Mi&s;ery, and the only
Pattern of the bittere&s;t Unhappi|ne&s;s, and now &s;he finds him inve&s;ted
with Robes of Glory, the Owner and Giver of all Felicity. She that had &s;o
long &s;ought without finding, wept with|out Comfort, and call'd without
An&s;wer, is now fully &s;atisfied with this one word, <HI>Mary,</HI> having
heard him call her in his wonted Manner, and u&s;ual Voice, this one word
re&s;tor'd her Sen&s;es, enlighten'd her Mind, quicken'd her Heart, and
re|viv'd her Soul.</P>
<P>But why did <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> chu&s;e to be made known to her by the
Ear, rather than by the Eye, by Hearing rather than by Appearing, becau&s;e her
Eyes were hol|den, till her Ears were open'd? The Philo&s;ophers tell us,
<HI>Hearing</HI> is the Sen&s;e of Wi&s;dom, and in Matters of Faith the
<HI>Ear</HI> goes fir&s;t, and is of more u&s;e, and <PB N="196" REF="235"> to
be tru&s;ted before the <HI>Eye.</HI> No &s;ooner had <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Voice
&s;ounded in her Ears, but &s;he knew forthwith it was he; and being ravi&s;h'd
with his Voice, and im|patient of Delays, a &s;udden Joy &s;o over|pre&s;t her,
by &s;o unexpected a Pre&s;ence, and &s;o many Miracles laid at once before
her, that &s;he could no more proceed in her own, than give <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>
leave to go forward with his Speech; but falling at his &s;acred Feet, &s;he
offer'd to bath them with Tears of Joy, and to ki&s;s his late
<HI>grievous,</HI> but now <HI>mo&s;t glorious</HI> Wounds. But Chri&s;t forbad
her, &s;aying, <HI>Touch me not:</HI> This &s;eem'd a &s;trange Rebuke to
<HI>Mary,</HI> who when dead in Sin, &s;he touch'd his mortal Feet, and now
being alive in Grace, &s;he was denied to touch his glo|rious Feet, being
commanded from that for which &s;he was before commended by our
<HI>Saviour.</HI> Alas! What Harm had there been if he had &s;uffer'd her to
touch him? Before his Pa&s;&s;ion, many de&s;ir'd and &s;trove to touch him,
and there went Virtue out of him, even while he was <HI>Mortal,</HI> but now he
was <HI>Immortal</HI> in all likelihood much more Virtue would pro|ceed;
Chri&s;t was not u&s;ed to be &s;o ten|der of being touch'd; at &s;everal Times
and Places he &s;uffer'd the rude Multitude to crowd and thru&s;t him, and much
ruder <PB N="197" REF="236"> Touches at his Pa&s;&s;ion: Why &s;uffer'd he them
<HI>then,</HI> and why &s;uffer'd he not her <HI>now?</HI> &s;he had touch'd
before both his Head and his Feet, and anointed them both, and &s;he now
brought Odours in her Hand to Re-embalm him; It was early, and yet by that time
&s;he had given very good Proofs of her Love: She was early up, came fir&s;t to
the Grave, return'd and call'd <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> &s;taid la&s;t
at the Grave, had been at &s;uch Co&s;t, taken &s;uch Pains, had wept &s;o much
as to refu&s;e Comfort, even when offer'd by Angels, till &s;he had found
<HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;he was a Stranger to Con&s;ola|tion, and now having found
him, that &s;he mu&s;t not touch him, &s;eems very hard; one poor Touch had
been but an ea&s;ie Recompence for all her Pains and Sorrow; But if we look
into the Rea|&s;on <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> gives, it is yet more &s;trange, <HI>Touch
me not, for I am not yet a&s;cen|ded,</HI> as if he had &s;aid, when he was
A&s;cended then &s;he &s;hould; but if &s;tand|ing upon Earth by him, he is not
to be touch'd, when he is taken up in|to Heaven no Arm can reach him there.</P>
<P>There is a Time and Place for <HI>No|li me tangere.</HI> The World
began with a <HI>Noli me tangere.</HI> The fir&s;t Words <PB N="198" REF="237">
God &s;pake then were, <HI>Touch not the forbidden Fruit</HI>: But Chri&s;t is
not the forbidden Tree but the Tree of Life, to be touch'd and ta&s;ted, that
we may live by him; but this <HI>touch me not</HI> was not on
<HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Part, but on <HI>Mary</HI>'s, no Lett in him to be touch'd,
the Lett was in her, &s;he might not touch him; would <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> have
Men to touch him, and not Wo|men; for St. <HI>Thomas</HI> put his whole Hand
into the Place of his Wounds, and put him to no Pain at all; and certain
<HI>Wo|men</HI> met him in the way after his Re&s;ur|rection, among&s;t which
was <HI>M. Magdalen,</HI> and he then &s;uffer'd them to touch him, and take
him by the Feet: So that it &s;eems this Prohibition was not Real but
Per&s;onal, not ab&s;olutely but not at that time; which &s;hews all was not
well with <HI>M. Magdalen,</HI> &s;omething was ami&s;s, &s;he mu&s;t have been
to blame in the Manner of her Offer; &s;he mu&s;t have been a little too
forward it may be, and not have us'd all the Re&s;pect &s;he &s;hould have
done: For as &s;oon as <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> cry'd <HI>Mary,</HI> &s;he an&s;wer'd,
with her wonted Term, <HI>Rabboni</HI>; and as &s;he &s;aluted him with her
u&s;ual Word, &s;o after her Cu&s;tom &s;he went towards him, and would have
touch'd him, not in &s;uch a Manner as was fitting to be ob|&s;erv'd, nor with
that Regard which his <PB N="199" REF="238"> new glorified E&s;tate &s;eem'd
ju&s;tly to re|quire, for that which was enough to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> a few Days
pa&s;t, was not &s;o now: She poor Woman was defective in her Judgment out of
an Exce&s;s of her Affe|ction, &s;he thought he had been <HI>Rabboni</HI>
&s;till: It &s;eem'd to her that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was now as her Brother
<HI>Lazarus</HI> was after his Re|&s;urrection; that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> had
ri&s;en neither more nor le&s;s but ju&s;t the &s;ame he was be|before, to be
&s;aluted, approach'd, and touched as formerly he had been.</P>
<P>It &s;eems &s;he was not before &s;o carry'd away with Sorrow, but
&s;he was now as far gone in the other of Joy, and &s;o for|got her &s;elf in
offering to touch him no otherwi&s;e than &s;he did before: Her Ca&s;e was like
St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s in the Mount, who knew not what he &s;aid, when he
pro|pos'd the building of three Tabernacles; &s;he knew not what &s;he did,
being &s;o &s;ur|pris'd with the &s;udden Joy, as &s;he had no Lei&s;ure to
recollect her &s;elf, to weigh the wonderful great Change this Day wrought in
him: For when her Judgment was better &s;ettled, &s;he did touch him but then
it was upon her Knees, down at his Feet, another manner of Ge&s;ture than as it
&s;eems &s;he fir&s;t offer'd.</P>
<P>'Tis true he gave St. <HI>Thomas</HI> leave to touch, who&s;e Faith
was in his Fingers <PB N="200" REF="239"> Ends; he then believ'd not, was in
Doubt, thought he had been a Gho&s;t, and to clear that Doubt he was &s;uffer'd
to touch him; St <HI>Thomas,</HI> and <HI>M. Magdalen,</HI> or whoe|ver touch'd
<HI>Chri&s;t</HI> on Earth, if they had not been more happy to touch him with
their <HI>Faith,</HI> than with their <HI>Hands,</HI> they had receiv'd no Good
at all by it; it was much better with Faith to touch the Hemm of his Garment,
than without it to touch any Part of his Body; touching was the proper Cure for
St. <HI>Thomas</HI>'s Di|&s;ea&s;e; but &s;o it was not for <HI>M.
Magda|len,</HI> who was &s;ure the Voice &s;he heard was that of
<HI>Rabboni,</HI> &s;he had no need to be confirm'd in that. Her Di&s;ea&s;e
was of another Sort, not want of Faith, but want of due Regard; <HI>Thomas</HI>
touch'd be|cau&s;e he believ'd not, &s;he touch'd not becau&s;e &s;he
misbeliev'd; he touch'd that he might know Chri&s;t was ri&s;en; &s;he touch'd
not that &s;he might know, he was not &s;o ri&s;en as &s;he imagin'd, that is
as in former times &s;he knew him. And <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> did hereby &s;ilently
tell her, there was a great Difference between a glorious and a mortal Body,
between the Condition of momentary and eternal Life, and that &s;he &s;hould
rather with Reverence fall down afar off, than with &s;uch Familiarity
ap|proach to touch him; that &s;he was fir&s;t <PB N="201" REF="240"> to
embrace him with a firm Faith, then &s;he &s;hould touch him with more worthy
<HI>Hands</HI>; and therefore he commanded her to go about that which requir'd
more ha&s;te, to run to his Brethren and inform them, that he would go before
them in|to <HI>Galilee,</HI> and there they &s;hould &s;ee him; and &s;o <HI>M.
Magdalen,</HI> preferring her <HI>Lord</HI>'s Will to her own, obey'd his
Command in departing, but thought her &s;elf but an unfortunate Me&s;&s;enger
of mo&s;t joyful News, being bani&s;h'd from her Ma&s;ter's Pre&s;ence, to
carry News of his Re&s;ur|rection; and going in this perplex'd Manner, &s;he
meets by the way the other holy Women, (who fir&s;t came with her to the Grave)
whom the Angels had then a&s;&s;ur'd of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Re&s;urrection, and
as they all pa&s;s'd towards the Di&s;ciples, <HI>Je&s;us</HI> met them,
&s;aying, <HI>All Hayle, and &s;o they came near, and took hold of his
Feet,</HI> and ador'd him; then he &s;aid unto them, <HI>Fear not, go tell my
Brethren that I go into Galilee, there they &s;hall &s;ee me.</HI></P>
<P>Thus Chri&s;t apply'd a Lenitive to a&s;|&s;wage <HI>M.
Magdalen</HI>'s Pain, after the &s;harp Corro&s;ive which had griev'd her
tender Wound, which was made rather by Ig|norance than Error, and was as &s;oon
cur'd as known, and therefore &s;he was now admitted to ki&s;s his Feet.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="241">She had indeed great Favours granted her, not
only to &s;ee Angels, but to &s;ee <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and him fir&s;t of all;
and more than that, to be employ'd by <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> upon a heavenly Errand,
and no Rea&s;on for this but that &s;he lov'd much. We cannot &s;ay &s;he
believ'd much, &s;ince &s;he believ'd no more than ju&s;t as much as the
<HI>High Prie&s;t</HI> would have the World believe, that he was taken away by
Night: Her Faith cannot be commended, but her Love cannot but be prais'd, of
which &s;he gave good Proofs to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> both living and dead. St.
<HI>Augu&s;tin</HI> tells us the Rea|&s;on why <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;uffer'd her
not to touch him, was to wean her from all &s;en&s;ual and fle&s;hly touching,
to teach her a new and true Touch; for her touching of his Body, which &s;he
de&s;ir'd, would la&s;t but forty Days, and he therefore taught her another
Touch, that might &s;erve to the World's End.</P>
<P>But St. <HI>Gregory</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s forbid|ding her
to touch him, was to &s;ave Time, he being de&s;irous to di&s;patch her upon an
Errand better plea&s;ing to him, and that requir'd more ha&s;te; he was
care|ful that his Friends might receive Com|fort with the fir&s;t, and
therefore he bids her go with all &s;peed, for that it would do <HI>them</HI>
more good, to hear of his Ri|&s;ing, <PB N="203" REF="242"> than it would do
<HI>her</HI> to &s;tand and touch him. It was a great Honour to <HI>Mary
Magdalen,</HI> to be the Me&s;&s;enger of the&s;e ble&s;&s;ed Tydings, there is
no har&s;h Term in this Me&s;&s;age; for tho' his Di|&s;ciples fled from him,
for&s;ook him, and for&s;wore him, he hath forgotten and for|given all, he does
not ca&s;t them off, as they did him, but &s;ends to them by the Name of
<HI>Brethren:</HI> But this &s;pecial Ho|nour that was done to <HI>Mary
Magdalen,</HI> was withall a &s;ilent blaming the Di&s;ci|ples, for &s;itting
at Home &s;o drooping in a Corner, that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> not finding any of
them, is feign to &s;eek a new <HI>Apo&s;tle,</HI> and finding her where he
&s;hould have found them and did not, to &s;end to them by the Hand of her whom
he fir&s;t found at the Sepulcher, and by this <HI>Mary Mag|dalen</HI> ought to
be &s;atisfied; for to be thus &s;ent to be the Me&s;&s;enger of the&s;e
ble&s;&s;ed Tydings is a more &s;pecial Ho|nour done to her, than if &s;he had
been let alone, and been admitted to touch <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> which &s;he &s;o
eagerly de&s;ir'd; for we may be &s;ure <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> would never have
enjoyn'd her to leave the better and take the wor&s;e, to forbear to touch him,
to make the more ha&s;te to them, if that had not then been the better
Employment. The Rea&s;on why <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> bids her go and tell them,
<HI>That I a&s;cend,</HI> was, becau&s;e <PB N="204" REF="243"> he knew they
would &s;ay, Oh! He is ri&s;en, We &s;hall have his Company again as we had
before; but by &s;ending them word of his A&s;cending, he gave them warning
betimes, that he Ro&s;e not to make any Abode with them, or to Con|ver&s;e with
them on Earth, as formerly he had done. He knew this would be a hard
Le&s;&s;on, and would trouble them much, for they were &s;till over addicted to
his Bodily Being with them; here they would have detain'd him, built him a
Tabernacle here, and by their good Will, would never have let him go from
hence.</P>
<P>This was their Error, and to rid them of this Earthly Mind, thus
&s;triving to affix him, and keep him here on Earth, he &s;hews them they were
much mi&s;taken, and &s;ets them right: When <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was ri&s;en, he
was not far from a&s;cending, and if we be ri&s;en with him, we mu&s;t no more
look down into the Grave, nor fix our &s;elves on Earth, but &s;trive to
a&s;cend with him al&s;o.</P>
<P>All Things in <HI>Heaven</HI> and <HI>Earth</HI> do &s;o, ri&s;ing
they a&s;cend pre&s;ently: In <HI>Hea|ven</HI> the <HI>Stars</HI> are no
&s;ooner ri&s;en above the <HI>Horizon,</HI> but they are in their A&s;|cent,
and never leave a&s;cending, till they come to the highe&s;t <HI>Vertical</HI>
Point. In <PB N="205" REF="244"> <HI>Earth,</HI> the little Spires that peep
out of the Ground now at this Time (Na|ture's time of her Yearly
Re&s;urrection) they are no &s;ooner out but up they &s;hoot, and never leave
to a&s;pire till they have attain'd the full Pitch of the Growth al|low'd them
by Nature; &s;o &s;hould we from our Birth always a&s;cend, nor ever &s;top,
till we reach the highe&s;t Perfection our Nature is capable of.</P>
<P>In our &s;elves it is not &s;trange for earth|ly Men to have earthly
Minds, and ha|ving Clay for our Original, that our Souls &s;hould cleave to the
Du&s;t; &s;o it is with us, tho' &s;o it ought not to be: The very <HI>Heathen
Poet</HI> &s;aw, that tho' we be made <HI>of</HI> Earth, we are not made
<HI>for</HI> Earth: That an <HI>Heavenly Soul</HI> was not put into an
<HI>earthly Body,</HI> to the end the earthly Body &s;hould draw it down to the
<HI>Earth</HI>; but rather that the Soul &s;hould lift it up to Heaven, and
&s;o much is &s;hewn by our <HI>os &s;ublime &amp; vultus ad &s;ydera,</HI> the
very Frame of our Body that bears us up thi|therward; for tho' we are born in
this World and live in it, yet we belong to another Corporation, we are
Denizens of another Country, and Free of that <HI>City</HI> which is above,
who&s;e Builder is the <HI>Lord.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="245">Thus we &s;ee by what happened to <HI>Mary
Magdalen,</HI> and the other devour Women, that they were not only capa|ble of
Religious Offices, but that they were <HI>early</HI> in their Religious Work,
they began <HI>betimes.</HI> There is but one <HI>Pa|rable</HI> that tells us,
That they that came <HI>late</HI> to the Labour, were as well re|warded as the
<HI>earlie&s;t,</HI> and that is no Encouragement to late Comers, as not &s;o
much re&s;pecting the different Ages of a Man, but different Year of the World.
And let that <HI>Parable</HI> be under&s;tood after the Vulgar way of
interpreting it, yet we &s;hould remember that the&s;e that were call'd at the
la&s;t Hours came as &s;oon as they were call'd. <HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> and
the&s;e Women, were al&s;o earne&s;t and &s;e|dulous; and tho' their Devotion
was carried upon Things that could not be intirely done, yet <HI>God</HI>
ca&s;t no Cloud of Di&s;couragement upon them, but exalted and maintain'd their
Holy Confidence, and accepted their Devotion; for where the Root and
Sub&s;tance of the Work is Piety, <HI>God</HI> often overlooks &s;ome Errors in
Circum&s;tance as incon&s;iderable.</P>
<P>Let therefore <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> be our Pattern, let us learn
from her, that we may find <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>; if we &s;eek him <HI>early</HI>
and diligently, we &s;hall meet him: Let <PB N="207" REF="246"> us learn of her
to fear no Dangers in que&s;t of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and to think of no
Com|forts without him; let us ri&s;e with her in the Morning of our good
Motions, and let them not &s;leep in Sloath, when Diligence may execute them;
let us run with Repentance to our &s;inful Hearts, which in&s;tead of being
<HI>Temples</HI> (thro' our Faults) are become <HI>Tombs</HI> to
<HI>Chri&s;t:</HI> Let us roll away the Stone of our former Hardne&s;s, remove
all heavy Loads of <HI>Sin</HI> that oppre&s;s us, and look into our Souls,
whether we can there find <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>; If he be not there within us, let
us &s;tand Weeping without, and &s;ee him in other Creatures; &s;eek him, and
not his, &s;eek him for him&s;elf, and not for his Gifts; If our <HI>Faith</HI>
have found <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in a Cloud, let our <HI>Hope</HI> &s;eek to &s;ee
him: If our <HI>Hope</HI> hath led us to &s;ee him, let our <HI>Love</HI>
&s;eek farther into him: Let us &s;eek him truly, and no other for him; &s;eek
him purely, and no other Thing with him; &s;eek him only, and nothing be&s;ides
him; and if at the fir&s;t Search he appear not, think not much to per&s;evere
in Tears, and to continue our &s;eeking as <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> did. Let us
&s;tand upon the Earth, tread under us all worldly Vani|ties, and touch them
only with the Soals of our Feet; that is, with the lowe&s;t 
<PB N="208" REF="247"> and lea&s;t part of our Affections; and to look better
into the <HI>Tomb,</HI> let us bow down our Necks to the Yoak of Humi|lity,
that with lowly Looks we may find him, whom &s;welling and haughty Thoughts
have driven away: And if we can perceive in the Tombs of our Hearts, the
Pre&s;ence of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s two fir&s;t Me&s;&s;en|gers; that is, at the
Feet, Sorrow for the bad that is pa&s;t; and at the Head, De&s;ire to a better
that is to come; en|tertain them with Sighs, and welcome them with Penitent
Tears, and let us not cea&s;e &s;eeking till we find <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Thus preparing our &s;elves with Dili|gence, coming with Speed,
&s;tanding with fix'd Hopes, and &s;tooping with humble Hearts, if we crave
with <HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> no other Thing of Je&s;us but <HI>Je&s;us</HI>
him&s;elf, he will an&s;wer our Tears with his Pre&s;ence, and continue with us

Pupils; and among&s;t the various Sects at that time in <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI>
he was &s;pecially Edu|cated in the Principles and In&s;titutions of the
<HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> of which Sect was both his <HI>Father</HI> and
<HI>Ma&s;ter,</HI> whereof he became a mo&s;t earne&s;t and zealous
Pro|fe&s;&s;or; and <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> tho' a <HI>Phari&s;ee,</HI> gives this
following Character of them: 
<Q REND="inline"><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 171.3.</NOTE>"That
they were a crafty and &s;ubtil Generation of Men, and &s;o perver&s;e even to
Princes them&s;elves, that they would not fear many times to Affront and
Oppo&s;e them; and &s;o far had they in&s;inuated them&s;elves into the
Affections and E&s;timations of the Po|pulacy, <PB N="213" REF="252"> that
their good or ill Word was enough to make or bla&s;t any one with the People,
who implicitely would believe them, let their Re|port be never &s;o fal&s;e or
malicious:"</Q> Certain it is, They were infinitely Proud and In&s;olent, Surly
and Ill-natur'd, they hated all Mankind but them&s;elves, and cen&s;ur'd
tho&s;e who would not be of their Opinion and Way, as Reprobates. They were
extream zealous to gather Pro&s;elytes to their Party, not to make them more
Religious, but more fierce and cruel, (much like &s;ome, who think all
<HI>Religion</HI> confin'd within the Bounds of their own Sect, that none but
they were the Godly, and that all other Per|&s;ons were <HI>Sons of the
Earth</HI>) and there|fore they endeavour'd e&s;pecially to In|&s;pire all
their Party with a mighty Zeal and Fervency again&s;t all that differed from
them; &s;o that if any did but &s;peak a good Word of our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour,
he &s;hould pre&s;ently be pro&s;ecuted to Death.</P>
<P>The&s;e dogged and ill-natur'd Princi|ples, together with their
unmerciful Be|haviour, they endeavour'd to varni&s;h over with a more than
ordinary Pretence and Profe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Religion,</HI> and were
e&s;pecially diligent, in what co&s;t them lit|tle, <PB N="214" REF="253"> the
outward In&s;tances of Religion, as frequent Fa&s;ting, long Praying, with
demure and mortify'd Looks, in a whin|ing and affected Tone. <HI>Saul</HI> was
deep|ly leavened with the active and fiery Genius of this Sect, not able to
bear with any oppo&s;ite Party in Religion, e|&s;pecially if late or new;
in&s;omuch, that when the <HI>Jews</HI> were re&s;olved to do Execution upon
St. <HI>Stephen, Saul</HI> &s;tood by and kept the Cloaths of them that did it;
whether he was any farther en|gaged in his Death, we know not; but this was
enough, loudly to proclaim his Approbation and Con&s;ent, for <HI>God</HI>
chief|ly re&s;pects the Heart; and if the Vote be pa&s;&s;ed there, that writes
the Man guilty, tho' he &s;tirs no farther, it being ea&s;ie to murther a Man
by a &s;ilent Wi&s;h, or a pa&s;&s;ionate De&s;ire. In all Moral Actions,
<HI>God</HI> judges by the Will, and reckons the Man a Companion in the Sin,
who, tho' po&s;&s;ibly he may never actu|ally join in it, does yet inwardly
applaud and like it.</P>
<P>The Storm thus begun, increas'd a|pace, and a violent Per&s;ecution
began to ri&s;e, which mi&s;erably afflicted and di&s;|per&s;t the
<HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> in which <HI>Saul</HI> was a
Prime Agent, raging about in all Parts with a furious and ungovern|able 
<PB N="215" REF="254"> Zeal, &s;earching out the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> beating
them in the <HI>Synagogues,</HI> com|pelling many to Bla&s;pheme, impri&s;oning
others, and procuring their Death: He was a &s;ort of <HI>Inqui&s;itor</HI> to
the <HI>High Prie&s;t,</HI> by whom he was employ'd to find out tho&s;e
<HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> who preach'd again&s;t the <HI>Law</HI> of
<HI>Mo&s;es</HI>; and after having made a &s;trange Havock at
<HI>Jeru|&s;alem,</HI> he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the <HI>Sanhe|drim,</HI>
and there took out a Commi&s;&s;ion to go down and ran&s;ack the
<HI>Synagogue</HI> at <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> where many <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI>
that were per&s;ecuted fled for Shelter, <HI>Saul</HI> re&s;olving to bring up
tho&s;e he found there to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> in order to their Puni&s;hment
and Execution: But <HI>God</HI> who de&s;igned him for a Work of ano|ther
Nature, &s;topt him in his Journey; for as he was travelling with his
Com|panions upon the Road, not far from <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> on a &s;udden, a
Gleam of Light, which exceeded the Splendor of the Sun, darted from Heaven upon
them, whereat being very &s;trangely amaz'd and confounded, they all fell to
the Ground, and a Voice call'd to him, &s;ay|ing, <HI>Saul, Saul, Why
per&s;ecute&s;t thou me?</HI> To which he reply'd, <HI>Lord, Who art thou?</HI>
Who told him, He was <HI>Je&s;us</HI> whom he per&s;ecuted, becau&s;e what was 
<PB N="216" REF="255"> done to the Members, was done to the Head, that it was
hard for him to kick again&s;t the Pricks: That he now ap|pear'd to him, to
make Choice of him for an <HI>Apo&s;tle,</HI> and Witne&s;s of what he had now
&s;een, and &s;hould after hear, that he would &s;tand by him, and pre|&s;erve
him, and make him a glorious In&s;trument for the Conver&s;ion of the
<HI>Gentiles:</HI> This &s;aid, he asked our <HI>Lord,</HI> What he would have
him to do? Who bad him go into the <HI>City,</HI> where he &s;hould receive his
An&s;wer. <HI>Saul</HI>'s Com|panions, who were pre&s;ent at this
Di&s;|cour&s;e, heard a confu&s;ed Sound, but no di&s;tinct articulate Voice,
neither &s;aw they him that &s;poke to <HI>Saul</HI>; and pro|bably they being
Ignorant of the <HI>He|brew</HI> Language, wherein <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;poke to
<HI>Saul,</HI> they heard the Words, but knew not the Meaning of them.</P>
<P>Thus, when <HI>Saul</HI> was wa&s;ting the <HI>Church,</HI>
di&s;per&s;ing the Di&s;ciples, de&s;troy|ing the Chri&s;tians, following them
from the <HI>Synagogues</HI> into the Streets, from thence into their Hou&s;es,
when he breath|ed out Threatnings and Slaughter; the <HI>Lord</HI> without any
Expo&s;tulation might have poured down Vengeance upon him, he might have
commanded what Puni&s;h|ment he pleas'd to have &s;erv'd the Exe|cution 
<PB N="217" REF="256"> of Wrath again&s;t him: But if ever <HI>Mercy</HI> and
<HI>Judgment</HI> met together, here it was, <HI>Judicium mi&s;ericordiae,
&amp; mi&s;ericordia judicis,</HI> a Voice and a Stroak, the one &s;triking
down to <HI>Earth,</HI> the other lifting up to <HI>Heaven,</HI> a Light
&s;hin|ing from <HI>Heaven,</HI> and a Light &s;hining to direct him to
<HI>Heaven,</HI> a Light &s;hin|ing to him that was in Darkne&s;s and in the
Shadow of Death, to bring him from the Snare of Darkne&s;s into the glorious
Liberty of the Sons of <HI>God:</HI> He that was the <HI>Way</HI> met him in
the <HI>Way,</HI> he that was the <HI>Light</HI> met him with a <HI>Light,</HI>
he that was the <HI>Word</HI> met him with the Voice of a Word, <HI>Saul, Saul,
Why per|&s;ecute&s;t thou me?</HI></P>
<P>It was a gracious Favour of the <HI>Lord</HI> to vouch&s;afe to
Que&s;tion with him; but to call him by his Name, and to inge|minate that Name,
that was a &s;ign of his great Affection and Commi&s;eration: It was a Voice
indeed, the Voice of the <HI>Lord,</HI> mighty in Operation: This Voice
&s;truck him from his Hor&s;e to the <HI>Earth,</HI> &s;truck him from his
Pre&s;umption, <HI>Per|&s;ecute&s;t thou me?</HI> Yet the Voice was not more
<HI>Powerful</HI> than <HI>Merciful:</HI> It was (as <HI>Chry&s;ologus</HI>
&s;ays) <HI>Suaviter fortis, &amp; fortiter &s;uavis</HI>; the heavie&s;t Fall,
and yet the happie&s;t Fall that ever any had; <PB N="218" REF="257"> it was
his Fall and his Ri&s;ing. Thus a Dumbne&s;s unto <HI>Zachary,</HI> was not a
dumb In&s;tructor, it taught him Faith again&s;t another time; &s;o
<HI>Blindne&s;s</HI> &s;ent unto <HI>Saul,</HI> took away his
<HI>Blindne&s;s,</HI> making him &s;ee more in the Ways of Life, than all his
Learning gather'd at the Feet of <HI>Gamaliel</HI> could have Re|vealed unto
him</P>
<P><HI>Saul</HI> by this time was gotten up, but tho' he found his
<HI>Feet,</HI> he lo&s;t his <HI>Eyes,</HI> being &s;truck Blind with the
extraordi|nary Brightne&s;s of the <HI>Light,</HI> and was therefore led by his
Companions into <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> in which Condition he there remained three
Days together Fa&s;ting; and at this Time we may probably &s;up|po&s;e it was,
that he had the Vi&s;ion and Exta&s;ie mention'd by him.</P>
<P>There was at this time at <HI>Dama&s;cus, Ananias,</HI> one of the
Seventy Di&s;ciples, a very Devout Man, and probably the fir&s;t Planter of the
<HI>Chri&s;tian Church</HI> in <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> and tho' a
<HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> yet of great Repute among&s;t the <HI>Jews:</HI> To him
<HI>Chri&s;t</HI> appear'd, and directed him to the Street and Hou&s;e where
<HI>Saul</HI> of <HI>Tar&s;us</HI> then Lodged, who was then at Prayers, and
had &s;een him in a Vi&s;ion coming to him, to lay his Hands upon him, that he
might receive his Sight; <PB N="219" REF="258"> <HI>Ananias</HI> &s;tartled at
the Name of <HI>Saul,</HI> having heard of his bloody Temper and Practices,
knowing upon what Errand he was come to that City, was &s;ore afraid: But
<HI>Je&s;us</HI> quickly made his Fears vani&s;h, by telling him he mi&s;took
the Man, that he was now become a cho&s;en Ve&s;&s;el to Preach the
<HI>Go&s;pel</HI> both to <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gen|tiles,</HI> and before the
greate&s;t <HI>Potentates</HI> of the Earth, telling him what great Things he
&s;hould do and &s;uffer for his Sake. Hereupon <HI>Ananias</HI> went
forth|with to him, laid his Hands upon him, and told him, <HI>Je&s;us</HI> had
&s;ent him to him, that he might receive his Sight, and be filled with the
<HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> which was no &s;ooner &s;aid but done, and thick Films
like Scales fell from his <HI>Eyes,</HI> and his <HI>Sight</HI> return'd; then
he was Baptiz'd and &s;olemnly initiated into the <HI>Chri&s;tian Faith</HI>;
after which, he &s;oon joyn'd him|&s;elf to the Di&s;ciples of that Place, to
the great Joy and Wonder of the <HI>Church,</HI> that the <HI>Wolf</HI>
&s;hould &s;o &s;oon become a <HI>Lamb.</HI> He that was the Mouth of
Bla&s;|phemy, is become the Mouth of Chri&s;t: He that was the In&s;trument of
<HI>Satan,</HI> the Organ of the Holy Gho&s;t: As &s;ays St.
<HI>Chry&s;o&s;tome, Being yet upon the Earth, he is an Angel; and being yet
but a Man, he is already in Heaven.</HI> What was <PB N="220" REF="259"> done
upon him wrought upon all the World; he was &s;truck Blind, and all the World
&s;aw the better for it.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tome</HI> calls him a <HI>&V;niver&s;al
Prie&s;t,</HI> that Sacrificed not <HI>Sheep</HI> and <HI>Goats,</HI> but even
him&s;elf; and not only that prepar'd the whole World as a Sacrifice to
<HI>God,</HI> but &s;o ab&s;olutely did he Sacrifice him&s;elf and his State in
this World, as that he cho&s;e rather to be <HI>Anathema,</HI> &s;eparated from
<HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> than that they &s;hould; but whether that was not out of an
over vehement and incon|&s;iderate Zeal to his Bretheren, is too <HI>high</HI>
a Point for me to undertake to judge.</P>
<P>After the&s;e Words, <HI>Saul, Saul, Why per&s;ecute&s;t thou
me?</HI> he was no longer <HI>Saul,</HI> there was an immediate change of
Affections: Here's another manner of Lycanthropy, than when a Lamb is made a
Wolf; for here is a Wolf made a Lamb, a Bramble is made a Vine, un|profitable
Tares become good Wheat, and the la&s;t is made fir&s;t: He that was Born out
of Time, hath not only the Perfection, but the Excellency of all his
Lineaments. <HI>Saul</HI> was breathing Threat|nings and Slaughter again&s;t
the <HI>Church,</HI> when he was in the height of his Fury, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>
laid hold on him; this was for the <PB N="221" REF="260"> mo&s;t part
<HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Method of Curing: When the <HI>Sea</HI> was in a
tempe&s;tuous Rage, when the Waters cover'd the Ship, and even &s;haked that
which could re|move Mountains, even the Faith of the Di&s;ciples, then
<HI>Chri&s;t</HI> rebukes the Wind and commands a <HI>Calm</HI>: When the
<HI>Sun</HI> was gone out as a <HI>Gyant</HI> to run his Cour&s;e, (as
<HI>David</HI> &s;peaks) then <HI>God</HI> by the Mouth of another
<HI>Jo&s;uah,</HI> bids the <HI>Sun</HI> &s;tand &s;till: When the un|clean
Spirit foam'd and fum'd, tore and rent the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Per&s;ons, then
<HI>Chri&s;t</HI> commanded them to go out: <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;taid not here
till <HI>Saul</HI> being made drunk with Blood was ca&s;t into a Slumber, as
&s;ati&s;|fied with the Blood of <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> in the mid&s;t of his
Fit Chri&s;t gave him Phy|&s;ick, in the heat of his Madne&s;s he re|claims
him.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Paul</HI> gives this Evidence again&s;t him&s;elf, <HI>I
per&s;ecuted this way unto Death</HI>; What could he &s;ay more again&s;t
him&s;elf? And then &s;ays <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to this Tempe&s;t be
<HI>quiet,</HI> to this glaring <HI>Sun</HI> &s;tand <HI>&s;till,</HI> to this
unclean Spirit <HI>come forth</HI> And in this Sen&s;e St. <HI>Paul</HI> calls
him&s;elf <HI>aborti|vum,</HI> a Per&s;on born out of Sea&s;on: For whereas the
other <HI>Di&s;ciples</HI> and <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> had a &s;ort of a Growth
under <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and were fir&s;t his <HI>Di&s;ciples,</HI> and after
his <HI>Apo&s;tles:</HI> St. <HI>Paul</HI> was born a Man, an 
<PB N="222" REF="261"> Apo&s;tle, not carved out as the re&s;t in Time, but an
<HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> poured out, and ca&s;t in a Mould, as <HI>Adam</HI> was a
perfect Man in an in&s;tant; &s;o was St <HI>Paul</HI> an Apo&s;tle, &s;o
&s;oon as <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> took him in Hand: For St. <HI>Paul</HI> was not in
the Number of the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> at the De&s;cent the <HI>Holy
Gho&s;t</HI>; But then he had more than an equivalent Evidence of his
Mi&s;|&s;ion; For when he travel'd from <HI>Jeru|&s;alem</HI> to
<HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> the Heavens were open'd, and our <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed
Saviour</HI> him&s;elf &s;pake to him, whereupon the Company were
a&s;toni&s;hed, and St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;truck Blind with the Glory of the
Vi&s;ion; and afterwards being cured by a Miracle at <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> he
had no A&s;&s;i&s;tance from the re&s;t of the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> his
In&s;tructions came all from <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> immediately. And it cannot be
deny'd that St. <HI>Paul</HI> in &s;ome Kind, and upon &s;ome Subjects, is as
Elo|quent as ever Man was, not inferior to <HI>Demo&s;thenes,</HI> whom &s;ome
think he had read, or &s;ome other excellent <HI>Orators.</HI> His Speech to
<HI>Agrippa</HI> hath as much Force and Addre&s;s, and much more Great|ne&s;s
of Mind and noble Freedom, than any thing we meet with in the be&s;t of the
Heathen <HI>Orators:</HI> 'Tis true, the Advantage of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s
Education was great, he had his <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> and his <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> to
a&s;&s;i&s;t him, but yet he met with great <PB N="223" REF="262"> Difficulties
and Hazards in the Execu|tion of his Function: For he was to oppo&s;e the
Religion of the <HI>Jews,</HI> to alter the Cu&s;toms which <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>
had de|livered, and to decry the Expectation of a <HI>Temporal
Me&s;&s;iah</HI>; he charged them with the highe&s;t Crimes imaginable, and
told them plainly, That they had be|tray'd the <HI>Saviour</HI> of the World,
and kill'd the <HI>Prince of Life:</HI> And this he told the ob&s;tinate
<HI>Jews,</HI> who were hard|ned in Prejudice, and bigotted to Error and
Super&s;tition, for which they pleaded Antiquity: St. <HI>Paul</HI> declar'd to
the <HI>San|hedrim,</HI> that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> whom they had mur|ther'd was
rais'd from the Dead, was a <HI>Prince</HI> and <HI>Saviour,</HI> and that it
was from <HI>him</HI> they were to expect Remi&s;&s;ion of their Sins; with
this &s;evere &s;harpne&s;s St. <HI>Paul</HI> treated <HI>Faelix</HI> Viceroy
of <HI>Ju|dea,</HI> to whom he talked &s;o freely and &s;o pertinently, that
the Viceroy forgot his Character, and <HI>trembled</HI> before him.</P>
<P>And yet the Truth is, the Beginnings of our <HI>Religion</HI> were
very unpromi&s;ing; the fir&s;t Undertakers began with a &s;len|der Force, and
there was a &s;trange Di&s;|proportion between the Cau&s;e and the Effect; for
humanly &s;peaking, if <HI>twelve private Men</HI> &s;hould now make an
Expe|dition again&s;t the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> they would in all Probility
be as likely to &s;uc|ceed, <PB N="224" REF="263"> as the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI>
were in their En|terprize when our <HI>Saviour</HI> left them. But herein
certainly the Providence of God, for the Prevention of all Doubts and Scruples
was great, in that he would not lay the Foundation of <HI>Chri&s;tian
Re|ligion,</HI> as not in the force of Arms, &s;o neither of Eloquence and
artificial Speech, which is often in&s;i&s;ted upon by St. <HI>Paul, Not with
Wi&s;dom, nor the Ex|cellency of Speech, nor with enticing Words:</HI> And it
is worthy our Con&s;ide|ration, how it was po&s;&s;ible for a few poor Men,
&s;o low in <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> and <HI>Edu|cation,</HI> to break through the
Oppo&s;ition of <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> bafle their Learn|ing,
de&s;pi&s;e their Powers, and make them renounce their <HI>Ancient</HI> Belief,
and that Life they were mo&s;t in love with. But tho' they were &s;hort in
their natural Capacities, their wonderful Suc|ce&s;s is an undeniable Proof of
a <HI>Di|vine Power</HI> that a&s;&s;i&s;ted them; as <HI>Chry|&s;ologus</HI>
mo&s;t admirably tells us. <HI>Petrus &amp; Andreas, Jacobus &amp; Joannes,
ger|manitas combinata, ingeminata paupe|ras, in Apo&s;tolorum principes
eliguntur, pauperes cen&s;u, loco humiles, viles arte, ob&s;curi vit&acirc;,

28. which &s;hew the particular Gifts that Chri&s;t had given to his
Apo&s;tles.</P>
<P>Now to magnifie his <HI>Mercy</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI> more
particularly to St. <HI>Paul,</HI> and to take away all Occa&s;ion of
De&s;pair, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> did upon &s;o many great Di&s;advantages draw St.
<HI>Paul</HI> to him, whom he brought to that remarkable height on a &s;udden,
that the <HI>Church</HI> celebrates the Conver|&s;ion of no Man but this: She
does not con&s;ider the <HI>Martyrs</HI> as Born till they Die, till the World
&s;ee how they per|&s;ever'd to the End, &s;he takes no Know|ledge of them:
Wherefore &s;he calls the Days of their <HI>Death,</HI> their
<HI>Birth-Days:</HI> She does not reckon they are <HI>Born</HI> till they
<HI>Die:</HI> But of St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;he makes a&s;&s;ur'd the fir&s;t Day,
nay the fir&s;t Mi|nute, <PB N="226" REF="265"> the fir&s;t Moment, and
therefore celebrates his <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> only. And as <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>
dealt with St <HI>Paul,</HI> &s;o <HI>God</HI> deals with <HI>us,</HI> he will
fir&s;t ca&s;t us down be|fore he will rai&s;e us up, he will fir&s;t break us
before he will make us in his Fa&s;hion. The <HI>Lord</HI> only knows how to
Wound us out of Love, more than that how to Wound us into Love, not only with
him that Wounds us, but into Love with the Wound it &s;elf, with the very
Affliction that he inflicts upon us. The <HI>Lord</HI> knows how to &s;trike us
&s;o, that we &s;hall lay hold on the Hand that &s;trikes us, and ki&s;s the
In&s;trument that wounds us: <HI>God</HI> brings to the Gate of <HI>Death,</HI>
and by that Gate he leads us to eternal Life: He kills us here that we may live
for ever; he puts us low here that we may be exalted hereafter: And he hath not
di&s;cover'd, but made that Northern Pa&s;&s;age to pa&s;s from that <HI>Frozen
Sea</HI> of Calamity and Tribulation, to the heaven|ly <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI>
There are &s;ome Fruits that ripen not without <HI>Fro&s;ts</HI>; there are
&s;ome Natures that di&s;po&s;e not them&s;elves to <HI>God</HI> but by
<HI>Afflictions</HI>; And as <HI>Na|ture</HI> looks for the Sea&s;on, and does
not produce any Thing before; &s;o <HI>Grace</HI> looks for the
<HI>A&s;&s;ent</HI> of the <HI>Soul,</HI> and does not perfect the
<HI>whole</HI> Work, till <PB N="227" REF="266"> that come. It is
<HI>Nature</HI> that brings the Sea&s;on, but <HI>Grace</HI> the
<HI>A&s;&s;ent,</HI> and till the Sea&s;on for the Fruit, till the A&s;&s;ent

<HEAD>Of NOBILITY.</HEAD>
<P>_OBSERVING the &s;everal Alterations in Nobility, we &s;hall find
Four Principal Actors on the Theatres of Great Families: The Be|ginner,
Advancer, Continuer, and Ruiner. The Beginner, is he, who either by his
Virtues, Merits, or Riches, refineth him&s;elf from the Dro&s;s of the Vulgar,
and layeth the Foundation of his Hou&s;e: An excellent Workman in|deed, who not
only brings his Tools, but maketh his Materials: But yet An|cient Nobility
&s;eems no ju&s;t Ground to be Proud, and have a high Opinion of our &s;elves,
becau&s;e it's borrow'd. Tho&s;e great Actions, wherein we had no Share, cannot
be any part of our Commenda|tion, e&s;pecially if we have not Abilities to
imitate them; 
<Q> 
<L>Et genus &amp; proavos &amp; quae non ferimus ip&s;i,</L> 
<L>Vix ea no&s;tra voco.</L></Q> <PB N="229" REF="268"> That Man
mu&s;t be very Poor, who hath nothing of his own to appear in, but mu&s;t Patch
up his Pedigree with the Relicks of the Dead, and with the Tomb-&s;tones and
Monuments of his Ance&s;tors. Next comes the Advancer of Nobility, who improves
the Patri|mony of Honour he receiveth, and what his Ance&s;tor found Gla&s;s
and made Cry|&s;tal, he finds Cry&s;tal and makes it Pearl: Indeed, if a Man
could bequeath his Virtues, Merits and Courage, by Will, and &s;ettle his good
Sen&s;e, Learning and Re&s;olution, upon his Children, as cer|tainly as he can
his Lands, a brave An|ce&s;tor would be a mighty Privilege and great Advantage
to his Po&s;terity. Next is the Continuer of Nobility, who keep|eth his
Nobility alive, and pa&s;&s;es it to his Children, neither marring nor mending
it, but &s;ends it to his Son as he receiv'd it from his Father: Now this
Advantage only by Birth is often the effect of a Sloathful and Effeminate Life,
when Men will attempt nothing, either in the Field, or in their Clo&s;ets; when
they will neither Trouble them&s;elves with Study; nor be contented to expo&s;e
them&s;elves to the Weather, which Lazine&s;s renders them in&s;ignificant to
the great Purpo&s;es of Life; &s;uch Men think it a great <PB N="230" REF="269"> Addition to their Birth, to &s;tand at the Bottom of a long
Parchment Pedigree, and that their Blood hath run through the Channels of
Honour for many Ages: But alas! This Antiquity con&s;i&s;ts only in the
continual Frugality of the Family, who being once po&s;&s;e&s;t of an E&s;tate,
had the Di&s;cretion to keep it, and &s;o hath the Advantage of Living in a
better Hou&s;e, and Eating and Drinking better than tho&s;e who want a Fortune.
Indeed, if Ancient Nobility did convey to us any Advantage of Body or Mind, and
that every Generation grew wi&s;er, &s;tronger, hand&s;omer, or longer-liv'd
than other; if the Breed of a Man's Family were thus improv'd, then indeed the
Quality of their Arms would be contrary to their Cloaths, the one would always
grow better, the other wor&s;e for Wearing. The la&s;t is the Ruiner of
Families, who ba&s;ely degenerates from his Ance&s;tors; &s;o that Nobility in
him hath run &s;o far from its fir&s;t Starting that it's tired, and whil&s;t
he lives he is no better than his Grandfather's Tomb, without carv'd over with
honourable Titles, within full of Emptine&s;s and Corruption: Such noble Men as
the&s;e la&s;t, look upon it as one of the be&s;t Perfections of Nature, to
Dre&s;s them&s;elves well, and to come <PB N="231" REF="270"> hand&s;omly into
a Room; but let me tell the&s;e Ceremony-Gentlemen, that I think it much
better, that a Man's Parts &s;hould lie in his Head rather than in his Heels.
Indeed, in &s;ome Per&s;ons well-born there is a peculiar Noblene&s;s of Temper
in them. A Man may di&s;tingui&s;h their Quality by the Air of their Faces,
which are good Accompli&s;hments, and recom|mend them to Company with &s;ome
Ad|vantage; but then Men mu&s;t not be fond of the&s;e &s;mall Formalities, nor
magnifie them too much. I know in <HI>England,</HI> that a plain Gentleman of
an ancient Family is accounted a Per&s;on of better Quality than a new made
Knight, tho' the Rea&s;on of their Knighthood was ne|ver &s;o Meritorious; and
therefore many &s;uch Gentlemen have refus'd to be Knighted, but I think they
were much in the wrong: For the Rea&s;on why tho&s;e who are placed in that
Degree of Honour, precede others who are afterwards rai|&s;ed in the &s;ame
height, is for Encourage|ment of Indu&s;try, to make Men for|ward to exert
their earlie&s;t Endeavours to de&s;erve well of the Prince or State. It is but
rea&s;onable, that Merit &s;hould be con&s;ider'd, of what Date &s;oever it is,
and a worthy Action ought as well to be con&s;ider'd and rewarded, as one 
<PB N="232" REF="271"> of the &s;ame Kind was a thou&s;and Years &s;ince: If
the Inheritors of Ancient Ho|nour have not by Per&s;onal Additions im|prov'd
that Stock which was granted to their Ance&s;tors, there is no Rea&s;on it
&s;hould be valued above the &s;ame Degree (Precedency excepted) which is given
now: For to affirm, That a Family rais'd to Nobility by King <HI>Charles</HI>
or King <HI>James,</HI> is not as good as one rais'd by the Conqueror, is a
Reflection upon tho&s;e Kings; and it &s;uppo&s;es their Judg|ment and
Authority le&s;s con&s;iderable, and that the Fountain of Honour is dried up.
Honour is not like <HI>China</HI> Di&s;hes, which mu&s;t lie &s;ome Ages under
Ground before it comes to any Perfe|ction. In taking a true E&s;teem of
No|bility, we are not &s;o much to con&s;ider its Antiquity, as the Merit of
him to whom it was fir&s;t granted, and the Di|&s;tinction which the Prince put
upon it.</P>
<P>No Man will affirm an old Shilling to be better than a new
Half-Crown, or an old bra&s;s Medal dug out of the Ground long &s;ince, to be
more Valua|ble than the &s;ame Weight in Gold. If a Man were to pay a Debt, the
late King <HI>James</HI>'s Image upon a Piece of Gold would be more
&s;erviceable to him than <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s old Coins, which are only valu'd 
<PB N="233" REF="272"> for their U&s;efulne&s;s, becau&s;e they often rectify
Chronology, and explain Hi|&s;tory, and retrieve us &s;everal material Parts of
Learning, which had otherwi&s;e been lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Conquerors made Soldiers ambitious to follow them, by &s;haring the
Fruits of their Conque&s;ts with them; and when their Succe&s;&s;ors had not
E&s;tates &s;uffici|ent to Reward all the glorious Actions and eminent Services
which Per&s;ons did for them, being per&s;uaded that a Man of Courage values
nothing &s;o much as Honour, which di&s;tingui&s;hes him from other Men, they
invented Knighthood, which without exhau&s;ting their Trea|&s;ure, would gain
them the Honour of their Subjects, and inflame all others with an extream
De&s;ire to make them|&s;elves worthy of the &s;ame Honour; and it was for this
Rea&s;on that they created Knights, either ju&s;t before the Battle to make
them ingage more re&s;olutely, or pre&s;ently after it, to recompence tho&s;e
that had the greate&s;t Hand in the Vi|ctory. Thus Nobility is a Quality
ac|quir'd by virtuous Actions and emi|nent Services, which &s;ome Per&s;ons
have performed to the Prince and State; and tho' Fortune &s;hould have more
Influence than Merit, upon the di&s;pen&s;ing of the&s;e <PB N="234" REF="273">
Qualities, yet the &s;ame Judgment is &s;till to be made, becau&s;e Princes are
&s;ubject to their Pa&s;&s;ions, rewarding more boun|tifully and rai&s;ing
higher &s;ome of their Servants than others: But if a Man be advanced for
engaging him&s;elf in an un|ju&s;t Quarrel, he hath no better Pretence to
Honour than a re&s;olute Highwayman may challenge; and the Marks of all Favours
that either come by &s;ervile Flat|tery, or a dextrous Application to the Vices
of their Princes, are rather infa|mous than honourable to their Po&s;teri|ty,
being enobled for tho&s;e Qualities for which they &s;hould have been
pu|ni&s;h'd: It is a le&s;&s;ening to a Man's No|bility when the Rea&s;ons or
Grounds of it are unknown, and when the fir&s;t Prin|ciples of Honour happen to
be thus Cour&s;e and Counterfeit, 'tis not in the Power of Time to mend them,
when the Ri&s;e of a Family is owing to &s;uch an Original; a Man has a
particular Rea|&s;on not to flouri&s;h too much upon the Gifts of his Fortune,
&s;ince there is &s;o much Alloy in it. Nobility rais'd by Arms, when lawfully
undertaken, is cer|tainly more great than that which comes by Commerce. The
Profe&s;&s;ion of a Soldier has a particular Title to Ho|nour: It is more Noble
than the re&s;t; <PB N="235" REF="274"> and no wi&s;e Man will ever envy or
le&s;|&s;en the ju&s;t Character of Military Glo|ry: The Courage of a Soldier
does his Country not much Service after his Death; the Con&s;equences of his
Valour &s;eldom reach beyond his Death; &s;o there are few the better for it
except tho&s;e he engages for. A Martial Man, unle&s;s poli&s;h'd by Learning,
is u&s;ually &s;our in his Behaviour. The old Heroes were none of the
genteele&s;t Men; <HI>A|chilles,</HI> tho' a great Soldier, was very rugged and
moro&s;e in his Conver&s;a|tion. The Advantages of Learning are certainly very
great; without &s;ome &s;hare of this, War it &s;elf cannot be &s;ucce&s;s|ful;
nay, without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Let|ters, a Man can never be qualified for
any con&s;iderable Po&s;t in the Camp. For Courage without Conduct is not fit
to Command, and many times does more hurt than good. It is Learning that
teaches a General the Succe&s;&s;es and Events of Actions in former Ages: It
in&s;tructs him how to take Advantage of his Enemies, and to avoid tho&s;e
Mi&s;car|riages which have been fatal to others before him: It teaches him how
to For|tifie and A&s;&s;ault, how to manage the Difference of Ground and
Weather; <PB N="236" REF="275"> and the Advantages of Learning are more
la&s;ting than tho&s;e of Arms. Learn|ing in a Commander is like a Diamond
&s;et in Gold: I do not intend that a Commander &s;hould be ver&s;ed in thor|ny
School-Que&s;tions, but in Hi&s;tory, which is a &s;ilent Study and re&s;erv'd
Work: Tho&s;e that are not ver&s;ed in it, have Cricks in their Necks, and
can't look backward, nor &s;ee behind them the Actions which long &s;ince were
per|form'd: Hi&s;tory makes a young Man to be old, without gray Hairs, being
privileged with the Experience of Age, without the Infirmities or
Inconveni|ences thereof: Nay, it is not only ma|king Things pa&s;t, pre&s;ent,
but inables one to make a rational Conjecture of Things to come: For this World
affords no new Accidents, but in the &s;ame Sen&s;e wherein we call it a New
Moon, which is the Old one in another &s;hape, and yet no other than what hath
been formerly. Old Actions return again, furbi&s;hed over with &s;ome new and
diffe|rent Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that are only Continuers of their Honour or Nobility,
deceive the De&s;ires and Hopes of their Friends: Good is not good, when
proceeding <PB N="237" REF="276"> from them, from whom far better is expected.
Youthful Virtues are &s;o pro|mi&s;ing, that they cannot come off at riper Age
with Credit, without perform|ing &s;omething that may advance the Honour of
their Family, and build their Hou&s;es one Story higher than they found
them.</P>
<P>If our Ance&s;tors have gain'd Honour by the War, we &s;hould
enquire whether it were in a ju&s;t Cau&s;e, and whether Enterprizes or
Advantages were gain'd by Bravery, or whether by Chance or Treachery; for a
great many Per&s;ons have ventur'd far, and yet continue in their fir&s;t
Ob&s;curity; and I have known &s;ome in my Time, that are now grown great Men,
only by having the good Fortune to fall under the Notice of their General, and
being &s;ent by him with the good News of a Victory, they have been highly
Rewarded and Advanced. Such Men as the&s;e are thrown up Hill by another Man's
Arms, and made con|&s;iderable by Chance-Medly, their Me|rits having been very
incon&s;iderable, or rather nothing at all, when other Men in the &s;ame Battle
perform'd much more &s;ignal Service than that former Per&s;on; yet their
Courage was never Rewarded, <PB N="238" REF="277"> but lo&s;t in the Crowd and
Tumult of the Action, and got nothing but Blows for their Pains; whereas the
other are be|come Great, not by their Genealogy, but by good Fortune, and
having their Tongues well hung, and telling their Story hand&s;omely, which was
their great|e&s;t Merit. Men that are thus preferr'd, &s;hould remember that
there were others which ventur'd further, and perform'd more con&s;iderable
Service, which mi&s;|carried as to any private Advantage, be|cau&s;e they were
not &s;o lucky to give an Account to him that was able to Re|ward: So that we
daily &s;ee many Per|&s;ons, well furni&s;h'd for Employments and Honour, go
out of the World, as ob&s;curely as they came into it, only for want of a good
Occa&s;ion to bring them into Light: Now &s;uch Men as before|mention'd, who
have receiv'd &s;o valua|ble Con&s;ideration for their &s;mall or no Services,
ought to acquie&s;ce, and not pre&s;s too much, being Gentlemen only of the
fir&s;t Head, and &s;hould therefore manage their Advancement obligingly, for
by treating People roughly, they do but expo&s;e them&s;elves, and reproach
their own former Condition.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="278">Now he that is truly Noble, hath far different
Sentiments, his Greatne&s;s is ea&s;ie, obliging, and agreeable, &s;o that none
have ju&s;t Cau&s;e to wi&s;h him Le&s;s. He is &s;en&s;ible it is the Part of
true No|bility to be affable in his Conver&s;e, and generous in his Temper: He
is equally remov'd from the extreams of Pride and Ba&s;ene&s;s, and as
Pro&s;perity does not make him Haughty, &s;o neither does Adver&s;ity make him
Demean him&s;elf, he &s;corns either to trample upon tho&s;e below him, or to
cringe to the greate&s;t Monarch.</P>
<P>Ancient Nobility is very glorious, when 'tis found with Virtue,
which adds new Splendour to the Honour of his Hou&s;e, and challenges Re&s;pect
from all; but Lewd Greatne&s;s is nothing but the Rigour of Vice, having both
Mind and Merits to be uncontroulably Lewd: And a debauched Son of a Noble
Family, is one of the intollerable Burthens of the Earth; and the good
Education he hath had, is an Auxiliary to his Shame, and the Brightne&s;s of
his Ance&s;tors makes his Darkne&s;s more notorious. To be Good and Great is an
excellent Com|mendation; but he is more to be valued that is Good who&s;e
Father expired a <PB N="240" REF="279"> Clown, than the vitious Son of the
great|e&s;t Lord, tho' his Lineal De&s;cent be never &s;o high; For Virtue in a
Man of ob&s;cure Parents is like an unpoli&s;h'd Diamond which lies among
Pebbles, which tho' neglected by the Vulgar, yet the wi&s;e Lapidary takes it
up as a Jewel.</P>

<HEAD>Of CONTENTMENT.</HEAD>
<P>_IF Peace, as mo&s;t believe, e&s;tabli&s;hes the Throne of
Happine&s;s, and &s;afely guards it, 'tis Contentment alone that crowns it; if
Safety be the Fort, Contentment is the Magazine. Peace without Contentment is
but Le|thargy, Safety without it is but a Pri|&s;on, but Contentment without
both is a Kingdom: If without following Peace, a Man becomes his own Enemy, if
with|out endeavouring Safety he be his own Traytor, without enjoying
Contentment he is his own Troubler; the Di&s;contented Man hath neither
Neighbour, nor Friend, nor indeed him&s;elf. 'Tis not in the rich Fool's Barns,
nor in <HI>Ahab</HI>'s ravi&s;h'd Vine|yard, nor in <HI>Achitophel</HI>'s knack
of Wit, no nor in wi&s;er <HI>Solomon</HI>'s dear-bought Experience; no, 'tis a
quiet Content|ment of Spirit that a Man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es him|&s;elf. A Man may
pick a Quarrel with him&s;elf in the mid&s;t of all worldly Hap|pine&s;s, 
<PB N="242" REF="281"> without this Charm of Self-Con|tentment: The Truth is,
Di&s;content is the Bone that the Devil throws into eve|ry Man's Mouth to gnaw
upon, and break his Teeth with. You &s;hall hard|ly find any Man, that
complains not of &s;ome Want, tho' it be but Want of his own Will; Things go
not right, if they run not upon the vertiginous Wheels of his own Fancy; the
poor Man thinks the World unequally dealt, and the rich Man thinks &s;o too,
becau&s;e the Care, together with the Keys, hang &s;o heavi|ly about him; the
Schollar thinks the Soldier hath all the Money, and he a|gain, that the other
hath all the Ea&s;e; the &s;ingle Man wants a Wife, and the marry'd Man wants
no le&s;s in that he wants not a Wife; and Men &s;trive to vexthem&s;elves by
their own Di&s;contents, and flatter them&s;elves in not doing what they
&s;hould do, by pre&s;uming what they would do, were but their Condition o|ther
than it is, not con&s;idering that every E&s;tate hath its Weights as well as
Wings, and that the true Plea&s;ure of Life is to be free from Perturbation, to
enjoy the pre&s;ent (without any anxious Depen|dance upon the future) not to
amu&s;e our &s;elves either with Hopes or Fears, but to re&s;t &s;atisfied with
what we have, for <PB N="243" REF="282"> he that is &s;o wants nothing; the
great Ble&s;&s;ings of Mankind are within us, and within our reach, but we
&s;hut our Eyes, and like People in the dark, we fall foul upon every thing we
&s;earch for, with|out finding it, an equality of Mind makes every Man his own
Supporter; whereas he that is born up by any thing el&s;e may fall; it is a
contented Mind that makes a Man Happy; there mu&s;t be a Con|&s;tancy in all
Conditions, with &s;uch an indifferency for the Bounties of Fortune, that
either with them, or without them, we may live Contentedly.</P>
<P>It is the part of a great Mind to be temperate in Pro&s;perity, and
re&s;olute in Adver&s;ity. There are &s;ome that will clo&s;e and grapple with
ill Fortune, and will come off victorious; but there are others again &s;o
delicate, that they can|not &s;o much as bear a &s;candalous Report; which is
the &s;ame thing, as if one &s;hould quarrel for being ju&s;tled in a Crowd, or
da&s;hed as he walks in the Streets: A brave Man mu&s;t expect to be
to&s;&s;ed, for he is to &s;teer his Cour&s;e in the Teeth of Fortune, and to
work again&s;t Wind and Weather.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t Cau&s;e of Impatience grows not &s;o much from the
Force of Calamity, as from the Reluctance of the <PB N="244" REF="283"> Mind of
him that &s;uffers it; this rai&s;es the Billows within, for tho' the Calami|ty
may be rough and beyond our Power to extricate; yet when it meets with a Mind
as tumultuous as the Calamity, it rai&s;es a Storm, as when the Wind and Tyde
are contrary, which may endan|ger the Ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>He that violently contends again&s;t Mi&s;|fortunes, is like one
bound with &s;trong Bonds, his &s;truggling gauls him more than his Bonds would
otherwi&s;e do, and a proud Spirit contributes more to his own Unea&s;ine&s;s,
than his Cro&s;s does: But Calmne&s;s of Mind breaks the force of the Calamity,
and the contented Man looks upon his wor&s;t Condition to be le&s;s than he
de&s;erves, for &s;o long as we live in this World, there is no Condi|tion &s;o
trouble&s;ome but it may be wor&s;e: If we be Poor and under a Cloud of
Ig|nominy and Reproach, yet if we have our Health of Body and Compo&s;edne&s;s
of Mind, that's more than we de&s;erve; nay, if we be under a Complication of
Misfortunes, &s;o long as our Lives are &s;pared, there's Hope, and we mu&s;t
be Patient under all Conditions, &s;ubmitting our &s;elves intirely to the Will
of God; and that not only as an Act of Nece&s;&s;ity and Duty, but as an Act of
Choice and <PB N="245" REF="284"> Prudence, &s;ince all the Succe&s;&s;es of
our Life are under the Government of Providence, and we may be a&s;&s;ured,
that God will either in due time re|move them, or &s;upport us under them.</P>
<P>Temporal Afflictions are Spiritual Phy|&s;ick, being admini&s;tred
by the no le&s;s tender than skillful Hand of Providence; but we, like
fooli&s;h Patients, embitter our Condition, by chewing the Pills which we
&s;hould &s;wallow; we mingle our Pa&s;&s;ions with our Cro&s;&s;es, and thro'
Impatience &s;truggle with our Yoak, thereby making our Burthen more hea|vy,
and our Afflictions the more grie|vous: God's Love is fatherly for Ea&s;e, as
well as motherly for Tender|ne&s;s; as a Father he will &s;ometimes hum|ble his
Children by Afflictions, &s;u&s;tain|ing them with his Hand, not as a Mo|ther,
&s;till indulging them in Delights: He does always &s;end his Staff with his
Rod, his Grace with his Affliction, to In&s;truct, Support and Comfort us
Where|fore it's well &s;aid, That all the Troubles and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es that
befal us, tho' bitter Arrows, yet they come from the &s;weet Hand of God,
who&s;e &s;pecial Providence over us is &s;uch, that he afflicts us in Mercy:
God's Patronage and Protecti|on is not like that of Men, who as
<HI>Sal|vian</HI> <PB N="246" REF="285"> &s;ays, They offend the Mi&s;erable by
defending them; like the thorny Bu&s;h, to which in the Storm when the poor
Sheep run for Shelter, they lo&s;e their Fleeces: But God is a Sun and a Shield
to tho&s;e in Affliction; A Sun to en|lighten them in the mid&s;t of
Darkne&s;s, and a Shield to defend them in the mid&s;t of Dangers; and by his
Spiritual Providence he then &s;aves, when we &s;eem to be pa&s;t Succour; and
there|fore we have rea&s;on, not only patient|ly to &s;ubmit, but cheerfully
and con|tentedly to bear any Condition which he di&s;pen&s;es, and with an
implicite Faith to re&s;ign our Wills to his, be|ing a&s;&s;ured it is
infinitely more Wi&s;e and Ju&s;t than ours.</P>
<P><HI>Seneca</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Optimi milites ad duri&s;|&s;ima
mittuntur</HI>; the &s;toute&s;t Soldiers are put upon the hotte&s;t Service;
and &s;o the be&s;t Men upon the &s;harpe&s;t Suffe|rings. It is a mark of a

not &s;ay his General u&s;es him ill, but does him Ho|nour; and &s;o &s;hould

generous Spirits; and we are <PB N="247" REF="286"> not to look upon the
cro&s;s Encounters of Fortune, as a Cruelty, but as a Con|te&s;t. God tries and
hardens us, the fa|miliarity of Misfortunes brings us the Contempt of them, and
that Part is &s;tronge&s;t which is mo&s;t exerci&s;ed; the Seaman's Hand is
callous, the Soldier's Arm is &s;trong, the Tree that is expo&s;ed to the Wind
takes the be&s;t Root. Tho&s;e People that live in a perpetual Winter, in

Bani&s;hment, <HI>Socrates</HI> by Pri&s;on, <HI>Cato</HI> by Death; 'Tis only
in adver&s;e Fortune and bad Times, that we find great Ex|amples:
<HI>Mutius</HI> thought him&s;elf Hap|pier <PB N="248" REF="287"> with his Hand
in the Flame, than if it had been in the Bo&s;om of his Mi|&s;tre&s;s: He was a
Man only of a Mili|tary Courage, without the help either of Philo&s;ophy or
Letters; who when he found he had kill'd the Secretary in&s;tead of
<HI>Por&s;enna</HI> the Prince, burnt his Right Hand to A&s;hes for the
Mi&s;take, and held his Arm in the Flame till it was taken away by his very
Enemies. And <HI>Por&s;enna</HI> did more ea&s;ily Pardon <HI>Mutius</HI> for
his intent to kill him, than <HI>Mutius</HI> forgave him&s;elf for mi&s;&s;ing
of his Aim: He might have done a Luckier Thing but never a Braver.
<HI>Metellus</HI> &s;uffer'd Exile re&s;o|lutely, <HI>Rutilius</HI> cheerfully;
<HI>Socrates</HI> di&s;|puted in the Danger; and tho' he might have e&s;caped,
refu&s;ed it, to &s;hew the World how ea&s;ie a thing it was to &s;ub|due the
two great Terrours of Mankind, Death and Pain. The Action of <HI>Ruti|lius</HI>
was commended by his very Ene|mies, who upon a glorious and publick Principle
cho&s;e rather to lo&s;e his Coun|try, than to return from Bani&s;hment; the
only Man who deny'd any thing to <HI>Sylla</HI> the Dictator, who recalled him;
but he not only refus'd to come, but retired farther off: <HI>Let them,</HI>
&s;ays he, <HI>who think Bani&s;hment a Misfortune, live Slaves at</HI> Rome,
<HI>under the imperious</HI> <PB N="249" REF="288"> <HI>Cruelties of</HI>
Sylla; <HI>He that &s;ets a Price upon the Heads of Senators, and after a Law
of his own In&s;titution again&s;t Cut-Throats, becomes the greate&s;t
him&s;elf.</HI> Is it not better for a Man to live abroad in Exile, than to be
ma&s;&s;acred at home? 'Tis not the Torment, but the Cau&s;e we are to
con&s;ider; and in &s;uffering for a good Cau&s;e, the more Pain the more
Renown; and we mu&s;t look upon our Bani&s;hment and Hard&s;hips as Acts of
Providence, which &s;uffers Particulars many Times to be wounded, for
Con|&s;ervation of the whole: Be&s;ides, God cha&s;tizes &s;ome People under
appearance of Ble&s;&s;ing them, turning their Pro&s;pe|rity to their Ruin.</P>
<P>What was <HI>Regulus</HI> the wor&s;e becau&s;e Fortune made choice
of him for an emi|nent In&s;tance of Patience; he was thrown into a Ca&s;e of
Wood, &s;tuck round on the in&s;ide with pointed Nails, &s;o that which way
&s;oever he turned his Body it re&s;ted upon his Wounds; his Eye-lids were cut
off to keep him waking, and yet <HI>Mecaenas</HI> was not happier upon his Bed
than <HI>Regulus</HI> upon his Torments. <HI>It hath plea&s;ed the Gods,</HI>
&s;aith he, <HI>to &s;ingle me out for an Experiment of the Force of humane
Nature.</HI> Indeed no Man knows his own Strength or Value but 
<PB N="250" REF="289"> by being put to the Proof; the Pilot is try'd in a
Storm, the Soldier in a Battel: No Man can be happy that does not &s;tand firm
again&s;t all Contingencies and Mi&s;|fortunes, for the more we &s;truggle with
our Nece&s;&s;ities we draw the Knot the harder, the more the Bird flutters in
the Snare, the &s;urer he is caught; &s;o that the be&s;t way is to &s;ubmit
and lie &s;till, under this double Con&s;ideration, that the Pro|ceedings of
God are unque&s;tionable, and his Decrees not to be revoked. That Man is only
Happy that is unmov'd with any external Misfortune, or at lea&s;t &s;o little
mov'd, that the keene&s;t Arrow in the Quiver of Fortune is but as the prick of
a Needle to him rather than a Wound, and all her Weapons fall upon him as Hail
upon the Roof of a Hou&s;e, that crackles and skip off again without any Damage
to the Inhabitant.</P>
<P>Some Philo&s;ophers have &s;earch'd &s;o far for Arguments of
Comfort again&s;t Pain, as to doubt whether there was any &s;uch thing as
Sen&s;e of Pain; and yet when any great Evil hath befaln them, they could
&s;igh, and groan, and cry out as loud as other Men. Others have held that
Afflictions are no real Evils but only in Opinion, and there|fore a wi&s;e Man
ought not to be trou|bled <PB N="251" REF="290"> at them: But he mu&s;t be a
very wi&s;e Man that can forbear being trou|bled at things that are
trouble&s;ome. Others would delude this Trouble by a graver way of Rea&s;oning,
<HI>viz.</HI> that the&s;e things are fatal, and therefore we ought not to be
troubled at them, it being in vain to be troubled at what we cannot help. But
<HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> made a &s;harp Reply to one that mini&s;tred this Comfort
to him, <HI>Hoc ip&s;um e&s;t,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>quod me male habit.</HI>
This was &s;o far from giving any Ea&s;e to his Mind, that it was the very
thing that troubled him. But the be&s;t Moral Argument of Patience is, the
Advantage of Patience it &s;elf: That is, to bear Evils as quietly as we can is
the way to make them lighter and ea&s;ier; but to to&s;s, and fling, and to be
re&s;tle&s;s, is good for no|thing but to fret and inrage our Pain; 'tis like
Men in a Feaver, who infinite|ly increa&s;e their Heat by their tumb|ling and
to&s;&s;ing more than if they lay &s;till; and thus we gall our Sores, and make
the Burthen that is upon us &s;it more unea&s;ie, and like the Ship that is not
broken by the Rock but by its own vi|olent Motion again&s;t it; and therefore
we mu&s;t &s;o manage our &s;elves under <PB N="252" REF="291"> Afflictions, as
not to make them more grievous than indeed they are.</P>
<P>If we give way to our Pa&s;&s;ions, we do but gratifie our &s;elves
for the pre|&s;ent, in order to our future Di&s;quiet; but if we re&s;i&s;t and
conquer them, we lay the Foundation of perpetual Peace and Tranquility in our
Minds. The more we gratifie our Lu&s;ts, the more craving they will be;
<HI>Cre&s;cit indulgens &s;ibi diras hydrops,</HI> every Lu&s;t has a kind of
hydropick Di&s;temper, the more we drink the more we &s;hall thir&s;t, &s;o
that by retrenching our inordinate De&s;ires we do not rob our &s;elves of any
Plea&s;ures, but only the trouble of farther Di&s;&s;atisfacti|on.</P>
<P>He that enjoys the greate&s;t Happine&s;s in this World, does
&s;till want one Hap|pine&s;s more to &s;ecure him for the fu|ture what he
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es at pre&s;ent; and if the Enjoyments of this Life were
cer|tain, yet they are un&s;atisfying; it is a hard thing that every thing in
this World can trouble us, but nothing can give us Satisfaction. I know not how
it is, but either we or the things of this World, or both, are &s;o
fanta&s;tical, that we can neither be well with the&s;e things nor without
them: If we be hungry we are in Pain, and if we be full we are un|ea&s;ie; 
<PB N="253" REF="292"> if we are poor we think our &s;elves mi&s;erable, and if
we be rich we com|monly really are &s;o; if we are in a low Condition we fret
and murmur, if we chance to get up and are rai&s;ed to Greatne&s;s we are many
times farther from Content than before; &s;o that we pur&s;ue the Happine&s;s
of this World ju&s;t as little Children cha&s;e Birds, when we think we are
very near it, and have it almo&s;t in our Hands, it flies farther from us than
it was at fir&s;t: Indeed the En|joyments of this World are &s;o far from
affording us Satisfaction, as the &s;weete&s;t of them are mo&s;t apt to
&s;atiate and cloy us: All the Plea&s;ures of this World are &s;o contriv'd as
to yield us very little Happine&s;s; if they go off &s;oon they &s;ignify
nothing, and if they &s;tay long we are &s;ick of them: After a full Draught of
any &s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ure, we pre&s;ently loath it, and hate it as much after
the Enjoy|ment as we &s;earched it and longed for it in Expectation: But the
Delights of the other World, as they &s;till give us full Satisfaction, &s;o we
&s;hall never be weary of them, every Repetition of them will be accompanied
with a new Plea&s;ure and Contentment: In the Fe|licities of Heaven two things
will be reconciled, which never met together in <PB N="254" REF="293"> any
&s;en&s;ual Delight, long and full Enjoy|ment, and yet a fre&s;h and perpetual
Plea&s;ure; it would embitter the Plea&s;ures of Heaven to &s;ee an End of
them, tho' at never &s;o great a Di&s;tance: But God hath &s;o ordered things
that the vain Delights of this World &s;hould be tempo|rary, but the
&s;ub&s;tantial Plea&s;ures of the next World be as la&s;ting as they are
excellent.</P>
<P>That Man is truly happy who is tempt|ed to no anxious Fore-ca&s;ts
for future E|vents, knowing nothing can happen in Contradiction of that Supreme
Will in which he hath Sanctuary, which will certainly chu&s;e for him with that
Ten|derne&s;s that an indulgent Father would for his Child that ca&s;ts its
&s;elf into his Arms: When our Will is thus inrolled with God's, all Calamities
are un&s;tring|ed, and even tho&s;e things which &s;eem mo&s;t repugnant to our
&s;en&s;itive Natures, are yet very agreeable to our Spirits. There is no Face
of Adver&s;ity &s;o formi|dable which &s;et in this Light will not look
amiable; let us but make &s;ure of Re&s;ignation, and Content will flow into us
without our farther Indu&s;try. <HI>Socra|tes</HI> &s;aid rightly of
Contentment, oppo&s;ing it to the Riches of Fortune, that 'tis the Wealth of
Nature, for it gives every thing <PB N="255" REF="294"> that we have learnt to
want and really need; and Re&s;ignation in our pre&s;ent State be&s;tows all
things that a Chri&s;tian not only needs but can de&s;ire: 'Tis the
U&s;urpation of our Will over our Rea|&s;ons which breeds all the Confu&s;ions
and Tumults within our own Hearts, and there is no po&s;&s;ibility of curbing
its In|&s;olence but by putting them into &s;afe Cu&s;tody, by oommitting it to
him who alone can order our unrully Wills, and nothing but Experience can
inform us of the Serenity and Calm of that Soul who has re&s;igned his Will to
God.</P>
<P>It is certain in the Cour&s;e of the World, there mu&s;t be a
greater number of Cro&s;&s;es and Troubles than of external Comforts, nay there
is &s;carce any Comfort but, like <HI>Jonah</HI>'s Gourd, it hath a Worm at the
Root of it, which not only withers the Comfort it &s;elf, but creates greater
Trouble and Sorrow than the Comfort it &s;elf hath if intirely enjoy'd; &s;o
that in all worldly things the Stock of Troubles is three times greater than
that of Com|forts; &s;o true is that of <HI>Job, A Man is born to troubles as
the Sparks fly upward</HI>; why therefore &s;hould a Man &s;ink into
Di&s;content, becau&s;e the World doth but follow its own natural State?</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="295">'Tis certain a prudent Man is like the Elixir,
it turns Iron into Gold, makes the mo&s;t &s;owr Condition of Life not only
tolerable but u&s;eful and convenient; for a wi&s;e Man will mould and frame
his wor&s;t Condition into a Condition of Comfort by his Patience, and he that
can content him&s;elf with the good Tem|per of his own Heart, has no Rea&s;on
to be di&s;contented with his Condition, &s;ince if it be not good he can make
it &s;uch, the Mind being the chief Matter either in Content or Di&s;content:
We need no other Proof than that of <HI>Ahab</HI> and <HI>Haman,</HI> the one a
great King the other a great Favourite to a mighty Mo|narch full of Wealth and
Honour, yet a covetous Mind in the one, and a proud Mind in the other, made the
former &s;eek for a little Spot of Ground, and the latter grew &s;o highly
di&s;contented for want of the Knee of a poor <HI>Jew,</HI> that it withered
all his Enjoyments. Patience and Re&s;ignation give us Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
our &s;elves, we then remain Ma&s;ters of our Pa&s;&s;ions, and tho' there be
Storms, and Tempe&s;ts, and rolling Seas without us, yet all is calm within;
and tho' I want &s;omething that others have, yet I have &s;omewhat that many
better than I want: If I want Wealth yet I have Health, if 
<PB N="257" REF="296"> I want Health, yet I have Children, which others want.
Thus we &s;hould learn Con|tentment, by con&s;idering others Wants and our
Enjoyments, and not learn Di&s;com|forts from others Enjoyments; tho' the&s;e
are only moral Con&s;iderations, yet they are of much U&s;e and Moment, and
car|ry'd the Heathens a great way in the Vir|tue of Patience. But we are
furni&s;h'd with a more excellent way, becau&s;e no Affliction befalls us but
is reached out to us from the Hand of Divine Providence, from whom we have our
Being: The ge|neral State of Mankind in this World is a State of Trouble and
Affliction, and is &s;o incident to all Degrees and Conditions of Mankind, that
no Per&s;on of what&s;oever Age or Sex but hath a Part in this com|mon State of
Mankind. And we find Men in all Ages, that only by the Dire|ction of natural
Light, have calmed their Di&s;quiets, and rea&s;oned them&s;elves into
Contentment, under the greate&s;t and mo&s;t terrible Pre&s;&s;ures; Men, who,
amid&s;t the acute&s;t Torments, have &s;till pre&s;erv'd a Serenity of Mind,
and have fru&s;trated Contempts and Reproaches by di&s;regard|ing them; and
&s;urely we &s;hall give a very ill Account of Chri&s;tianity, if we cannot do
as much with it as they did without it.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="297">The greate&s;t Cau&s;e of Di&s;content is,
that Men have no definite Mea&s;ure of their De&s;ires; 'tis not the Supply of
all their real Wants will &s;erve their
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">urn, their Appetites are
precarious, and depend up|on Contingencies; they hunger not be|cau&s;e they are
empty, but becau&s;e o|thers are full. Many would like their own Portion well
enough, if they had not &s;een another who&s;e Portion they lik'd better.
<HI>Ahab</HI> might well have &s;atisfy'd him&s;elf with the Kingdom of
<HI>I&s;rael,</HI> had not <HI>Na|both</HI>'s Vineyard lay in his way:
<HI>Haman</HI> could find no Gu&s;t in all the Sen&s;ualities of the
<HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Court, becau&s;e a poor de|&s;picable <HI>Jew</HI> denies
his Obei&s;ance; and thus every one of our Pa&s;&s;ions keeps us upon the Rack,
till they have obtain'd their De&s;igns. If we will create imagina|ry Wants to
our &s;elves, why do we not create an imaginary Satisfaction to them. 'Twere
the merrier Frenzy of the two, to be like the mad <HI>Athenian,</HI> who
thought all the Ships that came into the Harbour his own, than to be &s;till
tormenting our &s;elves with un&s;atiable De&s;ires; For we generally find
tho&s;e that are farthe&s;t re|mov'd from Want, are &s;o from Content too; they
take no notice of the real &s;ub|&s;tantial Ble&s;&s;ings they enjoy, and go in
que&s;t after &s;ome fugitive Satisfaction, <PB N="259" REF="298"> which, like
a Shadow, flies &s;till fa&s;ter in proportion to their Pur&s;uit. A &s;trange
Folly, thus to court Vexations, and be mi&s;erable in Chimera. We chew the Cud
upon Gall and Wormwood, and embitter our own Lives meerly by the&s;e imaginary
Sufferings; nor do we only fright our &s;elves with Images of pa&s;t
Calamities, but we lay romantick Scenes for Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and rai&s;e
Alarms to our &s;elves: We do nicely and critically ob&s;erve every little
adver&s;e Accident of our Lives, and let a whole Current of Pro&s;perity glide
by without our Notice; like little Children, our Fingers are never off the
&s;ore Place, till we have pick'd every light Scratch into an Ulcer: Whereas,
if we ca&s;t up our Accounts ju&s;tly, we &s;hall find our Receits have
infinitely exceeded our Disbur&s;e|ments, and that for the few Mites of
Obe|dience we have pay'd to our Creator, we have receiv'd Talents of Mercies
from him; but in&s;tead of entertaining our &s;elves with the plea&s;anter
Parts of God's Di&s;|pen&s;ations to us, we always pore upon the har&s;her, and
look upon our Misfor|tunes through all the magnifying Opticks our Fancies can
&s;upply; and we are &s;o full of our &s;elves, that we can &s;ee nothing
beyond it. Every Man expects God &s;hould place him where he hath a Mind to be,
<PB N="260" REF="299"> and tho' we are apt to tax it as a great In|ju&s;tice in
a Prince, when he indulges any thing to a private Favourite to the pub|lick
Di&s;advantage, yet &s;o unequal are we, that we murmur at God for not doing
that which we murmur at Men for doing. We mu&s;t con&s;ider that other Men have
the &s;ame Appetites with us, and if we di&s;like an inferior State, why
&s;hould not we be|lieve others do &s;o too; and we mu&s;t not think God
&s;hould be more concern'd to humour us than tho&s;e Multitudes of o|thers who
have the &s;ame De&s;ires. Every Man would be above and &s;uperior, and if no
Man were below, no Man could be above: So in Wealth, mo&s;t Men de&s;ire more,
but every Man does at lea&s;t de&s;ire to keep what he has, how then &s;hall
one Part of the World be &s;upply'd, without the Diminution of the other,
unle&s;s there &s;hould be as miraculous a Multiplication of Trea&s;ure for
Men's Avarice, as there was of Loaves for their Hunger. It was a good An&s;wer
which an Amba&s;&s;ador of an oppre&s;&s;ed Province gave to <HI>Anthony, If, O
Emperor, thou wilt have double Taxes from us, thou mu&s;t help us to double
Springs and Harve&s;ts.</HI> And &s;ure God mu&s;t be at the Trouble of a new
Creation, make a double World, if he &s;hould ob|lige him&s;elf to &s;atisfy
all the unrea&s;onable <PB N="261" REF="300"> Appetites of Men; the Truth is,
we have generally in us the wor&s;er Part of the Le|vellers Principles, and
tho' we can very contentedly behold Multitudes below us, yet we are impatient
to &s;ee any above us; and thus we create Torments to our &s;elves by our own
Repinings, which only &s;ets us farther from our Aims.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable of the fir&s;t two Kings of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI>
who were of God's immediate Ele|ction, that he &s;urpriz'd them with that
Dignity when they were about a mean Imployment, the one &s;eeking his Father's
A&s;&s;es, the other keeping his Father's Sheep; and &s;urely he that &s;its
down with this Ac|quie&s;cence, is a happier Man than he that enjoys the
greate&s;t Worldly Splendor, but infinitely more &s;o than he who impatient|ly
covets what he cannot attain, for &s;uch a Man puts him&s;elf upon a perpetual
Rack, keeps his Appetites up to the utmo&s;t Stretch, and yet hath nothing
wherewith to &s;atisfy them; for either we are trou|bled for the Want of
&s;omething we de&s;ire, or at the &s;uffering &s;omething we would avoid. And
there is no Man who &s;ober|ly recollects the Events of his Life, but mu&s;t
confe&s;s that he hath &s;ometimes de|&s;ir'd Things that would have been to
his Mi&s;chief, if he had had them; and on the other &s;ide, when he has
obtain'd what he de&s;ir'd, <PB N="262" REF="301"> it hath been to him a
Puni&s;hment, rather than a Satisfaction; whereas by our Acquie&s;cence under
the Ills we &s;uffer, the Bitterne&s;s is taken off from all our Af|flictions,
there being nothing which &s;o much purifieth us, if we do not fru&s;trate
their Efficacy by our irregular Manage|ment under them.</P>
<P>Afflictions wean us from the World; we read in the Story of the
Deluge, &s;o long as the Earth was covered with Waters, the very Raven was
contented to take &s;helter in the Ark; but when all was fair and dry, even the
Dove finally for&s;ook it; and it is much &s;o with us, the wor&s;t of Men will
commonly in Di&s;tre&s;s have Re|cour&s;e to God, when the be&s;t of us are apt
to forget him in the Blandi&s;hments of Pro&s;perity: We &s;hould not therefore
give our Hearts to any external Thing, but let all the Concerns of the World
hang loo&s;e about us, whereby we &s;hall quit them in|&s;en&s;ibly, whenever
they are call'd for. We mu&s;t not look to be carried into Heaven upon Beds of
Ivory, nor from the Noi&s;e of Harps and Viols to be immediately wrap'd up into
the Choir of Angels: We may certainly often find that tho&s;e Events which we
have entertain'd with Regret, have, in the Con&s;equences, been very
be|neficial to us, of which I am &s;till a living <PB N="263" REF="302">
Te&s;timony; for all the good Fortune and Promotion, which by their late
Maje&s;ties Grace and Favour I attain'd to, was oc|ca&s;ioned only by the
Dexterity I then &s;hew'd in giving &s;uch good Account of Affairs abroad,
whil&s;t I was then in Pri&s;on at <HI>Bruges.</HI> Nay, &s;ometimes the
Inhuma|nity of a Man's Relations are the Occa&s;i|on of his Advantage; thus the
barbarous Malice of <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>'s Brethren was the fir&s;t Step to his
Dominion over <HI>Egypt</HI>; and it is a common Ob&s;ervation in Families,
that the mo&s;t di&s;couraged Children u&s;ually prove better than the
Darlings; and there is nothing more ordinary than for that which one e&s;teems
a great Calamity to be|come the Foundation of our future Hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>A low Condition is a terrible thing in Sound and Opinion, and that's
all: Some Men are bani&s;ht and &s;tript of their E&s;tates, others are poor in
Plenty, which is the ba&s;e&s;t &s;ort of Beggary, for to &s;pare of what a Man
hath, not only what he may need, but what he doth need, is not only to walk
with a Man's Hor&s;e in his Hand, but to carry the Saddle too; and of the two
it is a great deal better to die a Beg|gar than to live a Beggar. We u&s;ually
condemn Villains to the Mines, and he that labours fir&s;t to get Mony, and
then <PB N="264" REF="303"> locks up his Mony from him&s;elf, condemns both
him&s;elf and it but again to the Mines, as if he envied both their very Being
a|bove Ground. Poverty is not a thing to be wi&s;ht no more than War, but if it
be our Lott, we mu&s;t bear our Misfortunes as becomes wi&s;e and hone&s;t Men;
we do not pray for War, but for Genero&s;ity and Cou|rage in all the
Extremities of War, if it hap|pens. Afflictions are but the Exerci&s;es of
Virtue, and an hone&s;t Man is out of his Element when he is idle: It is a
common Argument again&s;t the Ju&s;tice of Provi|dence, in the matter of Reward
and Pu|ni&s;hment, the Misfortunes of good Men in this World, and the
Pro&s;perity of the wicked; but alas, Misfortunes come by Divine Appointment,
and to tho&s;e that are good Men even for that very Rea&s;on becau&s;e they are
good: Pro&s;perity &s;hews a Man but one Part of humane Nature, no Body knows
what &s;uch a Man's good for, neither in Truth doth he under&s;tand him&s;elf
for want of Experiment. Tem|poral Happine&s;s is for weak and vulgar Minds, but
Calamity is the Touch&s;tone of a brave Mind, that re&s;olves to live and die
free and Ma&s;ter of it &s;elf; and Adver|&s;ity is be&s;t for us, for it is
God's Mercy to &s;hew the World their Errors, and that the things they fear and
covet are neither <PB N="265" REF="304"> good nor evil, being the common and
pro|mi&s;cuous Lott both of good Men and bad; if they were good only the good
&s;hould enjoy them, and if bad only the wicked &s;hould &s;uffer them: A
wi&s;e Man carries all his Trea&s;ure within him&s;elf; and what Fortune gives
&s;he may take, but he leaves nothing at her Mercy: He &s;tands firm and keeps
his Ground again&s;t all Misfortunes, with|out &s;o much as changing
Countenance, he is Proof again&s;t all Accidents: He is a Friend to Providence,
and will not mur|mur at any thing that comes to pa&s;s by God's Appointment,
and never any Man was broken by Adver&s;ity that was not fir&s;t betrayed by
Pro&s;perity. The Truth is, we are generally mi&s;taken in the Nature of Good
and Evil, and have not the true Mea&s;ures of it; that is truly good which
makes a Man the better, and that truly evil which makes a Man the wor&s;e; if
Pro|&s;perity makes me thankful, munificent and humble, then 'tis good for me,
and makes me better, but if it makes me proud 'tis evil for me: If Adver&s;ity
makes me cla|morous and murmur 'tis ill for me, but if it makes me humble,
&s;ober and patient then 'tis good; and let every Man impar|tially take the
Mea&s;ure of the very &s;ame Man in each Condition, he &s;hall find ten to one
receive more Mi&s;chief by Pro&s;peri|ty <PB N="266" REF="305"> than
Adver&s;ity. There is a &s;trange Witchcraft in Pro&s;perity which gets ground
upon our Mind and Virtue, e&s;pe|cially upon our Humility, for Worldly Grandeur
&s;ecretly &s;teals away that Vir|tue, and impairs it &s;ooner than any other;
Pride is the Devil, that u&s;ually haunts and waits upon Worldly Greatne&s;s:
How ma|ny Men have we &s;een, that under the greate&s;t Pre&s;&s;ures and
Calamities of Po|verty and Reproach have yet kept up their Reputation, but in
the warm Beams and Sun-&s;hine of Pro&s;perity have ca&s;t off their
Goodne&s;s, as the Traveller did his Cloak in the Fable, and became as great
Oppre&s;&s;ors and debauch'd Livers, as if they had never heard of Heaven or
Hell. True Humility is a great Guard upon the Soul of a Man again&s;t the&s;e
Rocks and Hazards; an humble Man looks upon all his Pro&s;perity and Plenty not
as his own, but as it is the Di&s;po&s;ition of the great Ma&s;ter of the
Family of Heaven and Earth, Talents entru&s;ted to him as a Steward to employ
for his Ma&s;ter's Ser|vice and Honour, and not for his own Grandeur and
Plea&s;ure; Our Vices are the Vermin that are commonly bred in us by the warm
Influences of Pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>We do not compare the Good of others with our Good, nor their Evil
with our <PB N="267" REF="306"> Evil, but with an envious Curio&s;ity we
ama&s;s together all the de&s;irable Circum|&s;tances of our Neighbour's
Condition, and with a prying Di&s;content we ran&s;ack all our Grievances, and
confront to them; this is but a thin Piece of Sophi&s;try; and we change the
Scene, we compare our Neighbours and our &s;elves in Point of Mortality, where
we make his Vices as much exceed ours, as our Calamities did his in the other
In&s;tance. However this is the plea&s;anter kind of Deceit, for a Man hath
&s;ome Joy in thinking him&s;elf le&s;s wick|ed than his Neighbour, but no
Comfort in thinking him&s;elf more mi&s;erable. Indeed if we could u&s;e our
Eyes aright, and &s;ee Things in their true Shapes, a Competen|cy would be more
plea&s;ing than Abun|dance, and the envy'd Pomp of Princes, when ballanc'd with
the Cares and Ha|zards annex'd, would rather make a wi&s;e Man fear than
de&s;ire Preferment; and if a Man well under&s;tood the Right, he would rather
chu&s;e to wield a Flail than a Scepter; and indeed there is no greater
Unhappine&s;s than the fond Admiration of other Mens Enjoyments, and Contempt
of our own: But if we would begin at the right end, and look with as much
Com|pa&s;&s;ion on the Adver&s;ities of others, as we do with Envy at their
Pro&s;perities, <PB N="268" REF="307"> every Man would find Cau&s;e to &s;it
down contentedly with his own Burthen.</P>
<P><HI>David,</HI> the Man after God's own Heart, was no le&s;s
&s;ignal for his Afflictions than for his Piety; he was &s;ometime an Exile
from his Country, and after being &s;ettled in his Throne, what a
Succe&s;&s;ion of Ca|lamities had he in his own Family; the ince&s;tuous Rape
of his Daughter, the Re|taliation of that by the Murder of <HI>Am|mon,</HI> and
that &s;econded by the rebellious and barbarous Con&s;piracy of
<HI>Ab&s;alon</HI>; his Expul&s;ion from <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI>; the ba&s;e
Re|vilings of <HI>Shimei</HI>; and la&s;tly, the Lo&s;s of his darling Son in
the Act of his Sin. It is an ill-natur'd thing for any Man to think him&s;elf
more mi&s;erable, becau&s;e another is happy, and yet it is this thing alone,
by which many Men have made them&s;elves wretched, having created Wants to
them|&s;elves, from the envious Contemplation of other Mens Abundance. Whenever
God admini&s;ters to us a bitter Cup, we may be &s;ure the Ingredients are
medicinal, and &s;uch as our Infirmities require; he dur&s;t not tru&s;t our
intemperate Appetites with unmix'd Pro&s;perities, the La&s;civou&s;ne&s;s
whereof, tho' it may plea&s;e our Palates, yet it may engender mo&s;t fatal
Di&s;ea&s;es. But alas, we do not under&s;tand our own Intere&s;t, becau&s;e we
do not rightly under|&s;tand <PB N="269" REF="308"> what we are our &s;elves.
We con|&s;ider our &s;elves meerly in our animal Be|ing, our Bodies, and when
we are in|vaded there, we think we are undone, tho' that Breach be made only to
retrieve that diviner Part within us, oppre&s;s'd with the Fle&s;h about it,
for our Body is to our Soul but as a Garment to the Body, a de|&s;ent Ca&s;e
and Cover; and certainly he mu&s;t be a mad Man that would not rather have his
Cloaths cut than his Fle&s;h, and we ought not to repine that our Souls are
cured at the Co&s;t of our Bodies; and our impatient Re&s;i&s;tances do only
fru&s;trate the medicinal Part of our Afflictions, and our Murmur|ings may ruin
our Souls but will never a|vert any of our outward Calamities.</P>
<P>To make a right E&s;timate of this World, we &s;hould con&s;ider it
as a Stage, and our &s;elves but as Actors, and to re&s;olve that it is very
little material what Part we play, &s;o we do it well; a Comedian may get as
much Applau&s;e by acting the Slave as the Conqueror, and he that acts the one
to Day, may to Morrow rever&s;e the Part and per&s;onate the other; and
certainly he that hath well impre&s;t upon his Mind the Vanity and Vexation of
the World, can|not be much &s;urpri&s;ed at any thing that be|falls him in it.
We take the magnifying Gla&s;&s;es of Di&s;content when we view our 
<PB N="270" REF="309"> own Mi&s;eries and others Felicities, but look upon our
Enjoyments and their Suf|ferings thro' the contracting Opticks of Ingratitude
and Incompa&s;&s;ion. It is a very ill-natured thing for any Man to think
him&s;elf more mi&s;erable becau&s;e another is happy, and yet this is the very
thing by which alone many Men have made them|&s;elves wretched, creating Wants
to them|&s;elves meerly from the envious Contem|plation of other Mens
Abundance. <HI>Lu|cifer</HI> was happy enough in his original State, yet could
not think him&s;elf &s;o be|cau&s;e he was not like the mo&s;t High, and by
in&s;olent Ambition forfeited his Bli&s;s; and tho&s;e do perfectly
tran&s;cribe his Copy, who cannot be &s;atisfied with any infe|rior Degree of
Pro&s;perity but what their Impatiencies with other Mens Enjoyments of what
they cannot attain. God never articled with the Ambitious to give him Honours,
with the Covetous to fill his Bags, with the Voluptuous to feed his Luxury; if
therefore we expect to be &s;a|tisfied let us mode&s;tly confine our De&s;ires
within the Limits God hath &s;et us, and then every Acce&s;&s;ion which he
&s;uperadds will appear a Bounty.</P>
<P>The be&s;t Expedient for Contentment is to confine our Thoughts to
the pre&s;ent. We often heap fanta&s;tick Loads upon our <PB N="271" REF="310">
&s;elves by anxious Pre&s;ages of things which perhaps will never happen, which
is one of the greate&s;t Follies imaginable; for either the Evil will come, or
it will not; if it will, 'tis &s;ure no &s;uch de&s;irable Gue&s;t that we
&s;hould go on to meet it, we &s;hall feel it time enough when it comes, we
need not anticipate our Sen&s;e of it; but if it will not come, what extream
Madne&s;s is it for a Man to torment him&s;elf with that which will never be,
to create to him&s;elf Engines of Tortures, and by &s;uch chimerical
Afflictions make him&s;elf as mi&s;erable as the mo&s;t real ones could do?
therefore let us re&s;t our &s;elves upon that admirable Aphori&s;m of our
Saviour's, <HI>&s;ufficient unto the Day is the Evil thereof.</HI> A querilous
repining Humour is one of the mo&s;t pernicious Habits in|cident to Mankind,
but yet as deform|ed People are mo&s;t often in Love with them&s;elves, &s;o
this crooked Piece of our Temper is of all others the mo&s;t indul|gent to it
&s;elf; it will nouri&s;h it &s;elf with Chimeras, &s;uborn a thou&s;and
ima|ginary Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and is impatient of any Diver&s;ion, loves to
conver&s;e only with it &s;elf: Men cheri&s;h this Di&s;ea&s;e of their Mind,
and improve their Torment, roll and chew the bitter Pill in their Mouths, and
by devoting all Thoughts to the Sub|ject <PB N="272" REF="311"> of their Grief,
keep up an uninter|rupted Sen&s;e of it, as if they had the &s;ame Tyranny for
them&s;elves which <HI>Caligula</HI> had for others, and lov'd to feel
them|&s;elves die. This Word Calamity hath an ill Reputation in the World, the
very Name is more grievous than the thing it &s;elf; what need any Man complain
if he can turn that into a Happine&s;s which o|thers count a Mi&s;ery? a wi&s;e
Man is ne|ver &s;urpri&s;ed, in the mid&s;t of Plenty he prepares for Poverty,
as a prudent Prince does for War in the Depth of Peace; our Condition is good
enough if we make the be&s;t on't, and our Felicity is in our own Power. Every
Man &s;hould &s;tand upon his Guard again&s;t Fortune, and take heed to
him&s;elf when &s;he &s;peaks him faire&s;t. A brave Man looks upon him&s;elf
as a Citi|zen, a Soldier of the World, in de&s;pite of Accidents and
Oppo&s;itions he maintains his Station, and is more ambitious of be|ing reputed
Good than Happy. <HI>Mutius</HI> lo&s;t his Right Hand with more Honour than he
could have pre&s;erved it; he was a greater Conqueror without it than he could
have been with it, for with the very Stump of it he overcame two Kings,
<HI>Tar|quin</HI> and <HI>Por&s;enna. Rutilia</HI> follow'd <HI>Cotta</HI> into
Bani&s;hment, &s;he &s;taid and &s;he return'd with him too, and &s;oon after
&s;he lo&s;t him <PB N="273" REF="312"> without &s;o much as &s;hedding a Tear;
a great In&s;tance of her Courage in his Bani&s;hment, and of her Prudence in
his Death.</P>
<P>Many Men have longer Intermi&s;&s;i|ons from Afflictions than
others, yet none are totally exempt from them; and that Man who hath lived to
the ordinary Ex|tent of the Age of Man, will find his Cro&s;&s;es and
Sufferings have out-weighed the trea&s;ure of his Comforts in this Life: The
poor Man reckons it his Affliction that he wants Wealth, and the rich Man is
not without his Afflicti|on, either in the Lo&s;s of it, or for fear of
lo&s;ing it.</P>
<P>Men in Pro&s;perity cannot &s;uppo&s;e a Change in their E&s;tates;
a healthful Man can hardly think of dying; the Rea&s;on is, that our pre&s;ent
Condition falls under our pre&s;ent Sen&s;e, and takes up our whole
Con&s;ideration, and things that are not yet are only pre&s;ent by
Contemplation, which does not &s;o &s;trongly affect the Mind, becau&s;e it
hath not the like Strength of Impre&s;|&s;ion upon the Mind as that which is
pre&s;ent and &s;en&s;ible; whereas an Ap|prehen&s;ion of a di&s;advantageous
Change of our Condition, admirably fills a Man with &s;uch a Temper of Spirit
as be|comes <PB N="274" REF="313"> his changed Condition: But a Man in
Pro&s;petity, that never puts him|&s;elf under the &s;ad Thoughts of a Change
of his pre&s;ent Happine&s;s, if &s;uch a Change befalls him he is at his Wits
end, he is &s;urpri&s;ed and over|whelmed with it, being taken before he is
prepar'd: It is certain it is a very great Improvidence for a Man to be
learning tho&s;e Virtues, when the pre|&s;ent Nece&s;&s;ity calls for the U&s;e
of them; it's like a Thief who is to learn to read when he is to pray his
Clergy.</P>
<P>Affliction doth not &s;o much endan|ger a good Man to lo&s;e his
Innocence as Wealth and Honour do; let any Man ob&s;erve either in him&s;elf or
others, we are all equally the wor&s;e for Pro|&s;perity, and it is a far
greater Diffi|culty to manage a pro&s;perous Fortune, than a low and afflicted
Condition; and therefore tho&s;e are &s;ecure&s;t from Affliction that u&s;e
their Pro&s;perity with Equality of Mind; becau&s;e they keep a Check upon
their Corruptions, and &s;o &s;tand in le&s;s need of this Phy&s;ick; for my
Part, I have quite forgot that ever I was pro&s;perous, and my ill For|tune
doth now the le&s;s trouble me; and I can well and truly &s;ay with

&s;aid, <HI>Lord when I was in Pro&s;perity I heard thee, but now in my
Affliction I &s;ee thee</HI>; which &s;hews nothing gives a more intimate
Knowledge of God than to be &s;ur|rounded with Tribulation; the Soul in 
<PB N="276" REF="315"> Pro&s;perity grows proud, deaf and care|le&s;s, &s;o
that &s;he mu&s;t &s;mart in the Sen|&s;es to be made &s;en&s;ible. We are not
to be wrought upon but when afflicted and in Mi&s;ery: <HI>Jonas</HI> in the
Whale's Belly, the Prodigal in the Pig-&s;ty, the Sick in hi Feaver, the
La&s;civious in his Sweat|ing-tub, then they recollect them&s;elves; but when
in Sports and Pa&s;times, &s;ay|ling in a Sea of Plenty and Delights, all our
Sen&s;es are &s;hut up, and no Pa&s;|&s;age open: Solid Virtue, like a Ro&s;e
amid&s;t Thorns, &s;eldom &s;prings forth but in the Soil of Cro&s;&s;es,
Afflictions and Au&s;terities. Tho&s;e Men are truly virtuous who take as it
were with the &s;ame Reli&s;h the Gall of Misfortunes and the Honey of
Pro&s;perity: No &s;tormy Sea&s;ons hinder their Journey, and that which
di&s;tracts the &s;oft and effeminate is to them Matter of Repo&s;e and Joy;
all Things that pa&s;s under the Name of Adver&s;ity are not &s;o but to the
wicked, who make ill u&s;e of them in pri&s;ing the Creature more than the

that God laid open <HI>Job</HI> to all the A&s;&s;aults of Satan, but with this
Re&s;erve, that he touch'd not his Life, and this not in regard that Death
would have eclip&s;ed the Glo|ry of that great Champion, but becau&s;e he would
not be depriv'd of &s;uch a Com|batant, to who&s;e Conflict God with his
ble&s;&s;ed Angels were intent with much Satisfaction, and &s;o would not
lo&s;e the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing that &s;tout Skirmi&s;h fought to the la&s;t,
betwixt him and his Enemy; and &s;omething to this Purpo&s;e St. <HI>Gregory
Ny&s;&s;en</HI> declares upon God's proceeding with the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI>
in com|manding them to &s;et up a brazen Ser|pent, at the Sight of which
tho&s;e who &s;hould be bitten by tho&s;e venomous Crea|tures might immediately
find their Cure; and asking the Rea&s;on why God did not take a &s;horter
Cour&s;e by de&s;troying all tho&s;e Serpents, which had given an end to the
Plague; he at la&s;t &s;atisfies him|&s;elf with this Rea&s;on, that whil&s;t

that gro&s;s ungrateful People would &s;oon have forgot; &s;o that to draw them

<P>Some Men are tired with whatever they have enjoyed in this World,
and ex|pect no greater Satisfaction &s;hould they live a thou&s;and Years;
every Plea&s;ure appears but the &s;ame in different Forms, and they all agree
in leaving us afflicted with the &s;ame or greater Pain they found us in. We
walk here on Earth in an inchanted Ca&s;tle of Shadows and Mock|eries, our
whole Life is full of Vanity and Mi&s;take; every Man's Fortune is but a
Repetition of <HI>Ixion</HI>'s, we court Clouds in&s;tead of Divinities, and
our mo&s;t charming Fruitions con&s;i&s;t in Emptine&s;s.</P>
<P>Re&s;ignation and Tranquility are the golden Mean, and he that
&s;teps over this Line on one &s;ide or the other, falls into the &s;ame Vanity
which he bemoans or ridicules in the re&s;t of Mortals. I have peru&s;ed many
Books, and convers'd with more Men, yet none of them can inform me what I am my
&s;elf; for in this Life we are faign to peep into the World thro' the clo&s;e

<P>Many great Princes have exchanged the toil&s;ome Glory and royal
Fatigues of Empire for the &s;weet Tranquility and Ea&s;e of a Country Farm,
and the whol|&s;ome Exerci&s;es of Agriculture: Thus <HI>Diocle&s;ian</HI>
quitted his Throne for the &s;ake of a private Life, and tho&s;e Hands which
had been accu&s;tomed to weild a Scepter, became at la&s;t volunta|rily
familiar with the Spade, the Plough, and the Harrow. So Grand <HI>Cyrus,</HI>
Mo|narch of the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> u&s;ed to boa&s;t of the Gardens planted
and &s;owed with his own Hands; &s;o may <HI>Louis le Grand</HI> well boa&s;t
that he hath exceeded all his Predece&s;&s;ors, nay even the Poets
them|&s;elves in their be&s;t De&s;criptions, in the Gardens and Water-works he
hath made at <HI>Marly, Ver&s;ailles</HI> and <HI>Triannon.</HI> 'Tis certain
the <HI>Fabii,</HI> the <HI>Lentuli,</HI> the <HI>Ci|ceros,</HI> and
<HI>Pi&s;oes</HI> derived their Names from tho&s;e kind of Vegetables which
they &s;ignify, and which their Fathers took delight in planting: Was not

<P>We are all &s;ubject to various Changes and Vici&s;&s;itudes in this

<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s to the Life the Plea&s;ure that a
Man feels in Solitude, when free and undi&s;turbed he can for many Hours behold
the Motions of the Moon and Stars, which rai&s;e pious Thoughts and
Contemplations within his Brea&s;t; his ravi&s;ht Soul is ready to break
Pri&s;on with Joy, when 'tis in&s;pir'd with certain Demon&s;trations of
Eter|nity, after which a Man is nau&s;eated with the narrow Principles of
ignorant Men, and hates to profane his Rea&s;on with the vain Di&s;cour&s;e of
&s;elf-conceit|ed <PB N="281" REF="320"> Fools and Ideots, a Man is then cloy'd

what Affections and Thoughts we harbour within. There are &s;ome &s;e|cret
Characters in every Man's Face which &s;peak the Nature of the Per&s;on; we
read the hidden Qualities of Men at the fir&s;t Da&s;h; &s;ome Men have the
very Signature of Virtue in their Faces, and hence are la&s;ting Friend&s;hips
often con|tracted.</P>
<P>I have &s;pent the Spring and Summer of my Life in Vanity, Error,
and Igno|rance, 'tis time I &s;hould provide for the Winter of my Age a &s;tock
of &s;olid Wi&s;|dom and Virtue.</P>
<P>It is as natural for the vulgar to inveigh again&s;t generous Souls,
as 'tis for Dogs to bark at the Moon, and yet that Planet is not moved at the

<P>God is pleas'd &s;o to di&s;pen&s;e his tem|poral Ble&s;&s;ings,
that he which hath lea&s;t <PB N="282" REF="321"> hath enough, not only to
oblige his Ac|quie&s;cence but his Thankfulne&s;s; tho' every Man hath not all
he wi&s;hes, yet he hath that which is more valuable than that he complains to
want. We mu&s;t keep our De&s;ires at home, and not &s;uf|fer them to ramble at
things without our Reach: God hath placed none of us in &s;o barren a Soil, in
&s;o forlorn a State, but there is &s;omething perhaps in it which may afford
us Comfort. But if in a &s;ullen Humour we will not cultivate our own Field,
becau&s;e we have per|haps more mind to our Neighbour's, we may thank our
&s;elves if we &s;tarve; the de&s;pi&s;ing of what God hath given us is but a
cold Invitation to farther Bounty, this complaining Humour is a Sickne&s;s of
the Mind, a perpetual Craving of the Appetite without any Po&s;&s;ibility of
Satisfaction, and is the &s;ame in the Heart which the <HI>Caninus
apetitus</HI> is in the Sto|mach: The Generality of Mankind be|ing commonly
made unhappy, not by any thing without them, but by tho&s;e re&s;tle&s;s
Impatiences that are within them. And if <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> the Lott of God's
own In|heritance, that People whom he had &s;ingled out from all the Nations of

Defect of God's Bounty, but from the malignant Temper within us; and as it is
an ea&s;ier thing to &s;atisfie the Cravings of a hungry Appetite, than to cure
the nau&s;eous Recoilings of a &s;urfeited Sto|mach, &s;o certainly the
Di&s;contents of the poor are more ea&s;ier allay'd than tho&s;e of the rich;
the Indigence of the one hath contracted his De&s;ires into a narrow Compa&s;s,

no Satisfaction: Alas! our Body, with all its Enjoyments, is but the lowe&s;t
In&s;tance of God's Boun|ty; 'tis but a decent Ca&s;e for that ine|&s;timable
Jewel within it; the Soul, like the Ark, is the thing for which this whole
Tabernacle was fram'd. The more intellectual Powers wherewith it is indued have
exerci&s;ed the Curio&s;ity and rais'd the Admiration of the great

the learned&s;t cannot affirm where they are <PB N="285" REF="324"> &s;eated,
or by what Means they operate. And con&s;idering whereof we are made, our
Pre&s;ervation is no le&s;s a Work of Omnipotence than our fir&s;t framing; nay
perhaps 'tis rather a greater, for we have now the Principles of Decay within
us, which tend to Di&s;&s;olution; we want the Supplies of &s;everal things
without us, the Failing whereof returns us again to our Du&s;t. The Air which
refre&s;hes us may at another time &s;tarve us, the Meat that nouri&s;hes us
may choak us; nay, there is no Creature &s;o incon&s;ider|able which does not
at &s;ome times &s;erve us, and which may not at any time (if God permit) ruin
us; and if the di|vine Providence did not draw out the better Properties of
the&s;e Creatures for our U&s;e, and re&s;train the wor&s;er for our Security,
we &s;hould quickly return to our Du&s;t. And if the ebbing and flowing of the

<HEAD>Of WOMEN.</HEAD>
<P>_THERE is much to be &s;aid in the Prai&s;e and Di&s;prai&s;e of
Women; as we are Rid|dles to our &s;elves, &s;o that Sex is in a much higher
de|gree My&s;terious; for Women have Ways by them&s;elves unknown to Men, their
Windings and Turnings are as intricate as tho&s;e of Serpents; and if
<HI>Daedalus</HI> were now alive, (tho' once the Glory of Labyrinth-makers) he
would be trou|bled to trace Women in all their &s;ecret, wild, unknown
Maeanders; and yet it is clear, that Womens Inclinations are not only
oftentimes better, but their Re|&s;olutions greater than Mens; and it is
ob&s;erv'd, that as they are generally more virtuous than Men, &s;o when they
deviate to Vice, they are more hardned in it.</P>
<P>The great Actions in which they have born a part, &s;peak the
Excellencies of their Nature: <HI>Judith</HI> in Sacred Writ is remembred with
great Glory; and <HI>Lu|cretia</HI> in the <HI>Roman</HI> Hi&s;tory, by her
Re|&s;olution, hath rai&s;ed her &s;elf an eternal <PB N="289" REF="328">
Monument; neither mu&s;t that Noble Vir|gin <HI>Clelia</HI> be forgot, who
being given in Ho&s;tage to King <HI>Por&s;enna</HI> at the Siege of
<HI>Rome,</HI> &s;he e&s;caped her Guards by Night, and mounting a Hor&s;e
&s;he found in the way, &s;he &s;wam over the <HI>Tyber</HI> in|to
<HI>Rome</HI>; whereupon, and upon what <HI>Mutius</HI> had a little before
done and &s;aid, <HI>Por&s;enna</HI> (as if terrified by the &s;tupen|dious
Re&s;olution of the <HI>Romans</HI>) con|&s;ented to a Peace.</P>
<P>And tho' &s;ome out of Wantonne&s;s of Wit, and Extravagancy of
Paradoxes, have called the Abilities of Women in que&s;tion; yet tho&s;e
Abilities be&s;t appear|ing in Matters of Religion and Govern|ment, we are in
neither of the&s;e with|out Examples of able Women. The la&s;t Age gave us &s;o
great a Queen for Go|vernment, as &s;carce any former King did equal; and this
Age &s;uch a Queen-Dowager to our late King, that if <HI>Plu|tarch</HI> were
again in being to write Lives by Parallels, he would not find for her Maje&s;ty
a Parallel among&s;t Women, &s;ince no Age hath &s;een her Equal for Beauty,
Piety, Virtue, Genero&s;ity, and other mo&s;t Eminent Abilities and Princely
En|dowments.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="329">The World indeed (which is no ju&s;t Judge)
will &s;carce allow Women to be Wi&s;e; and becau&s;e they are generally
commended enough for other Qualities, the World therefore delights to
le&s;&s;en on one Side, what it is forced to allow on the other: For we
u&s;ually find in Women a Delicacy of Wit not common to Men, neither are Men's
Actions com|monly attended with &s;o much Graceful|ne&s;s as Womens; and Ladies
are more skilful than Men in what they do, whether it be the Advantage of
plea&s;ing be more Natural to them, or that finding their great Strength to lie
there, they make it more their Study from their Child|hood: And where Women
have &s;ub|mitted them&s;elves to as good Education as Men, their Sex hath not
prejudiced them from being great Examples to o|thers; and this Sex hath always
been e&s;teem'd and found by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> wor|thy of Empire, and when
it hath been enthron'd, it hath be&s;tow'd great Feli|city upon the Nation,
neither hath it given Place to the other Sex for illu&s;tri|ous Qualities, and
the highe&s;t Virtues.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Venetian</HI> Story we find certain Matrons of that City
were &s;ent in Qua|lity as Amba&s;&s;adre&s;&s;es to an Emperor, with whom that
State had occa&s;ion to <PB N="291" REF="330"> treat; And in the
<HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Parts of the World, it's u&s;ual for Women to be
Am|ba&s;&s;adre&s;&s;es; and in Affairs of Religion, Women have ever had a
great Hand, tho' &s;ometimes on the Left as well as the Right; &s;ometimes
their abundant Wealth, &s;ometimes their Per&s;onal Affe|ctions to Church-men,
and &s;ometimes their indi&s;creet Zeal; many times the Voices of great Men,
both in Civil and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical A&s;&s;emblies, have been in the Power and
Di&s;po&s;ition of Women: And hence it is, that in the old Epi&s;tles of &s;ome
Popes, we find as many Letters of tho&s;e Popes, to the Emperors Wives,
Mothers, and Si&s;ters, as to the Emperors them&s;elves.</P>
<P>It would be a kind of unpardonable Envy to conceal &s;ome other
Excellen|cies of Women, and the Advantages they have of us in many Re&s;pects:
Some <HI>He|brew</HI> Doctors, from the different Names of <HI>Adam</HI> and
<HI>Eve,</HI> draw Arguments to prove the Dignity and Perfection of the Female
Sex, in that <HI>Adam</HI> &s;ignifies Earth, but <HI>Eve</HI> expre&s;&s;es
Life. And they affirm, That every Name which God impos'd on any thing,
de&s;cribes its Nature and Quality, as a Picture repre&s;ents the Ori|ginal;
and therefore by how much Life is to be e&s;teemed more than Earth, by 
<PB N="292" REF="331"> &s;o much more excellent, in the Opinion of the&s;e
<HI>Rabins,</HI> is Woman, than Man: They endeavour to &s;trengthen this
Opi|nion, by &s;hewing, that God having made Man, and then &s;urvey'd the
Sy&s;tem of his Works, found nothing more excel|lently and divinely fram'd than
Woman, and therefore in her re&s;ted and commen|ced the Sabbath, as if he could
not make the Idea of another Creature more per|fect than her, or as if he did
not e&s;teem the Univer&s;e it &s;elf compleat, without the la&s;t and mo&s;t
accompli&s;h'd of his Works: And as the End is always fir&s;t in the Intention,
and la&s;t in Execution, Woman therefore being the la&s;t Work of the Creation,
it is thereby evident that &s;he was the chief De&s;ign and Aim God Almighty
had in building this im|men&s;e Fabrick, which he furni&s;h'd and adorn'd with
infinite Riches and De|lights, and then introduced <HI>Eve</HI> as into her
Native proper Place, there to reign as ab&s;olute Queen over all his Works: And
be&s;ides, the particular Place of her Creation does much exalt her, in that
&s;he was formed in Paradice among&s;t the Angels, whereas <HI>Adam</HI> was
made in the common Wa&s;te among&s;t the Brutes: But the mo&s;t prevailing
Argument is from the &s;tupendious Beauty of that Sex, <PB N="293" REF="332">
which like finer &s;orts of Clouds in Sum|mer, &s;eem to ingro&s;s the Splendor
of the Sun, and to reflect his Beams on the World? How matchle&s;s is indeed a
Wo|man's Form? What dazzling Maje&s;ty en|virons her from Hand to Foot? Can you
gaze on her lovely Countenance without A&s;toni&s;hment, or fix your Eyes upon
her without an Exta&s;ie? Indeed, &s;o admirable is the Figure, Voice, and Mein
of a beautiful Woman, that he is wilfully Blind, who does not &s;ee, what|ever
Beauties the whole World is capa|ble of, are concentred in that Sex. Yet after
all this, they have their dark Side too, like the re&s;t of mixed Beings: They
are the Frontier Pa&s;&s;es of the World a|bove and of that below, the Gates of
Life and Death, the very Avenues to Heaven or Hell, according as they are
u&s;ed; like Fire they will warm and re|fre&s;h a Man, if he keeps at a due
di|&s;tance; but if he approach too near, they &s;corch and bli&s;ter him; or
like the other Element of Water, they are very good and &s;erviceable, whil&s;t
kept within their Bounds, but let them once break down the Banks of Mode&s;ty,
they'll threaten all with Ruin: In a word, It is neither &s;afe to Vex them in
the lea&s;t, or Humour them too much; the exce&s;s <PB N="294" REF="333"> of
Fondne&s;s, as well as the defect of natural Love, may equally undo us; Prudent
Genero&s;ity is the only Method of making our &s;elves happy in the En|joyment
of them. The frequent and familiar Conver&s;e Women are allow'd with Men,
within the Bounds of Mo|de&s;ty, both in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI>
is a great Advantage to them; and cer|tainly the <HI>Italians</HI> and
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> in their &s;o great &s;trictne&s;s to this Sex, do much
Err; for be&s;ides the Inju&s;tice they act, in depriving them of that Liberty
which God and Nature allows them, it is im|po&s;&s;ible they &s;hould ever
become more Virtuous by being confin'd to the Melan|cholly of a Cloi&s;ter,
which mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily indulge and mini&s;ter loo&s;e Thoughts, when if
they conver&s;t in the World, they might improve them&s;elves by Know|ledge,
and the Diver&s;ions they would receive from the Company of others, which would
keep them from thinking of Ill &s;o frequently.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent <HI>Jews</HI> of this Age, and <HI>Turks,</HI> have an
odd Opinion of Women, believing they are of an inferior Crea|tion to Man, and
therefore they exclude them, the fir&s;t from their Synagogues, the other from
their Mo&s;ques, which is not only Partial but Profane; for the 
<PB N="295" REF="334"> Image of the Creator &s;hines as clearly, if not more,
in the one, as in the other; and I believe there are as many Female Angels in
Heaven as Males, though in Heaven there be many Man&s;ions; to which may be
added, that there went better and more refined Atoms to the Creation of Woman
than there did of Man.</P>
<P>'Tis true, it was a weak Part in <HI>Eve</HI> to yield to the
Seducements of the Ser|pent, but it was a weaker Thing in <HI>Adam</HI> to be
tempted by <HI>Eve</HI> who was the weaker Ve&s;&s;el. The Ancient
Philo&s;o|phers had a better Opinion of that Sex, they a&s;cribed all Sciences
to the Mu&s;es, all Sweetne&s;s and Morality to the Graces, and Prophetick
In&s;pirations to the Si|bylls; and we find in all Authors high Examples of the
Virtues of Women; And if they did but con&s;ider what an A&s;cendant they have
upon Men, and that tho' they were the Source of all our Mi&s;eries, yet we
&s;till adore them, they would be &s;omething more complacent; for it is
certainly a &s;ign of good Nature to be amorous of Women; and he is look'd upon
as a Mon&s;ter, or degene|rate Per&s;on, who feels no Warmths of Pa&s;&s;ions
for that lovely Sex: Women were &s;ent into the World on purpo&s;e, 
<PB N="296" REF="335"> as many think, to blow up tho&s;e gentle Flames, which
&s;ublimate our gro&s;&s;er Mould, and make us more refined: The Love of Women
is riveted in our Na|ture, and our Blood mu&s;t fir&s;t grow Cold before this
Flame can be extingui&s;hed; nay many times it is more fervent, tho' of a
&s;hort Duration, in our late&s;t Hours than in our Prime: As when the Oil
which feeds a Lamp is almo&s;t &s;pent, the &s;tartled Flame begins to rouze it
&s;elf and burn afre&s;h, as if it would feign &s;ub&s;i&s;t a little longer,
and then it crackles and fla&s;hes with greater Noi&s;e and Lu&s;tre than
before, but pre&s;ently expires; &s;o does this Amorous Fire, when we are
neare&s;t our Di&s;&s;olution, begin to trou|ble us mo&s;t, and makes our Souls
blaze with Fevers of De&s;ire and Grief, know|ing its Period is near. I know
&s;ome Women are as Shadows, the more you follow them the fa&s;ter they fly
from you; and they are of that odd Humour, that to feed their Pride, they will
&s;tarve tho&s;e Natural Pa&s;&s;ions which are owing from them to Men: I
confe&s;s, Coyne&s;s be|comes &s;ome Beauties, if hand&s;omely acted, and a
Frown from &s;ome Faces penetrates more, than the &s;oft Glances of a mincing
Smile; but if this Coy|ne&s;s or tho&s;e Frowns &s;avour of Pride, 
<PB N="297" REF="336"> they are odious, if not ridiculous; for it is a true
Rule, where this kind of Pride inhabits, Honour &s;its not long Porter at the
Gate.</P>
<P>There are indeed &s;ome Beauties &s;o &s;trong, that no Batteries
can do any good upon them; there are others that are tenable a good while, but
will incline to Parley at la&s;t, and that Fort which begins to Parley is half
won: For my own Part, I think of Women what <HI>Phi|lip</HI> of
<HI>Macedon</HI> thought of Cities, There is none &s;o Inexpugnable but an
A&s;s laden with Gold may enter into it; and as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;ay,
Pre&s;ents may rend Rocks; Pearls and golden Bullets may do much upon the
mo&s;t impregnable Beauty that is. And yet I knew an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Lord
that &s;ent a little Dog to a Lady he e&s;teem'd much, with a rich Collar of
Diamonds; &s;he took the Dog, but re|turn'd the Collar; but what effect it
wrought after I cannot &s;ay. 'Tis a powerful Sex; they were too &s;trong for
the fir&s;t, the &s;tronge&s;t, and the wi&s;e&s;t Man that ever was; and yet
for all their Strength, in Point of Value, the <HI>Ita|lian</HI> &s;ays, (I
will not &s;ay truly) That a Man of Straw is worth a Woman of Gold. In fine,
the be&s;t Advice I can give in this Ca&s;e, is, When Women are 
<PB N="298" REF="337"> perver&s;e, retire hand&s;omely, there be|ing as much
Honour to be got in a hand|&s;ome Retreat, as in a hot Pur&s;uit; and by this
Retreat you will get a greater Victory than you think of, for you will Overcome
your &s;elf, which is the grea|te&s;t Conque&s;t that can be made.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e do great wrong to Ladies that e&s;teem them unable to govern
a State, &s;ince Hi&s;tory tells us, That the Female Sex is not only worthy to
bear the Scepter, but that Ladies have pre|&s;erved and enlarged the Kingdoms
of <HI>Spain, England, Denmark,</HI> and <HI>Swe|den,</HI> who never
flouri&s;hed &s;o much as under the two <HI>Elizabeths, Margaret</HI> and
<HI>Chri&s;tina:</HI> Never King of <HI>England</HI> was better obey'd than
Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>; the Commanders freely acknowledg'd their Victories
proceeded as much from the happy Genius of their Queen as from their own
Valour: And <HI>Elizabeth</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> Wife to <HI>Philip</HI> IV.
would have re-e&s;tabli&s;hed the Affairs of <HI>Spain,</HI> if the
Impertinency of a Favourite had not held her at a di&s;tance from the Councils
of the King her Husband: They are not all &s;ufficiently qualified to Rule,
neither are Men. There are but few Women indeed, becau&s;e the Malice or Envy
of Men keeps them off from <PB N="299" REF="338"> &s;hewing their Abilities,
and making their Prudence and Genero&s;ity admired; and if there were as many
Women as Princes upon the Throne, we &s;hould often find Female
Accompli&s;hments &s;uperior to ours, there being many Ladies worthy to Govern,
and would be many more, if they were in&s;tructed and brought up to great

the&s;e Evils and many others, which are &s;o much the greater, becau&s;e they
are aggravated by the &s;harp Re|flections of our own Thoughts, and if there be
no God we are wholly with|out Comfort, and without any other Re|medy than what

<P><PB N="303" REF="342">The great My&s;tery of Athei&s;m, is, that Men

<HEAD>Of RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>_MOST People take up their Religion for a Fa&s;hion, and receive it

Religion; and the Rea&s;on why we are <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> rather than
<HI>Jews, Turks,</HI> or <HI>Heathens,</HI> is becau&s;e Chri&s;tian Religion
had the Fortune to come fir&s;t in our Way, and be&s;peak us at our Entrance
into the World. The Chri&s;tian Religion may make <HI>Archymedes</HI>'s
Challenge, Give it but where it may &s;et its Foot, allow but a &s;ober
Advertence to its Propo&s;als, and it will move the whole World: It comes with
mo&s;t convincing Arguments, but the&s;e mu&s;t fir&s;t obtain Attention,
before they can force A&s;&s;ent. They will mo&s;t infallibly weigh down the
Scales, if you try and examine their weight.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="345">But it's to be fear'd we are &s;o &s;tupid and
unconcern'd, that all the per&s;ua&s;ive Rhetorick of the Go&s;pel will make no
Impre&s;&s;ion upon us, all the Avenues of our Rea&s;on are &s;o blocked up,
that they will find no way of approaching. We are like the <HI>Indian</HI>
Serpents <HI>Philo&s;tratus</HI> mentions, Proof again&s;t all Charms, but
&s;uch as with their glittering Splendor a&s;&s;ault our Eyes. Nothing moves us
but what courts our Sen&s;es, and what is not gro&s;s enough to be &s;een, we
think too nice to be con&s;ider'd. The Form and Name of Chri&s;tianity Men find
rea|dy to their Hands, and it co&s;ts them no Labour to call them&s;elves
Chri&s;tians, as they do <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> only be|cau&s;e
they were born within &s;uch a Territory, and have taken up their Re|ligion as
part of their Fate, the Temper of their Climate, the Entail of their
Ance&s;tors, the Profe&s;&s;ion of it de&s;cends to them by way of Inheritance,
and like young carele&s;s Heirs, they are never at the Charge to Survey it, to
inform them|&s;elves of the Revenues of it, what Bur|then it lies under, or
what Advantages it promi&s;es.</P>
<P>It is to be fear'd that of tho&s;e va&s;t Mul|titudes that have
entred the Bapti&s;mal <PB N="307" REF="346"> Vows, mo&s;t of them weigh it as
little when they &s;hould perform it, as they did when they made it, and have
no other Notion of Bapti&s;m, but as a Cu|&s;tom of the Place, or a Time of
Fea&s;t|ing, and con&s;ider no farther Significan|cy in tho&s;e Spiritual
Bonds, than they did in their Swadling Cloaths; and can give no better account
why they took on them Chri&s;t's Livery, than why they wear &s;uch Garments as
the common Fa&s;hion of the Country pre&s;cribes them: But where Men are &s;o
Ignorant, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily infer, their Parent's Negli|gence either in
not infu&s;ing, or their own &s;tubborn Perver&s;ene&s;s in re&s;i&s;ting
In&s;truction. But it is more probable to conclude the former, &s;ince if
Children were early in&s;tructed, Knowledge would in&s;en&s;ibly in&s;inuate it
&s;elf before their Years had arm'd them with Ob&s;tinacy enough to make Head
again&s;t it. And when by the Parent's Remi&s;&s;ne&s;s the proper Seed-time is
lo&s;t, the Soil grows &s;tiff and untractable, the Labour of Learning averts
their Childhood, and the Shame of it their Manhood, and they grow old in their
Ignorance, and are ready to leave the World before they come to know any thing
of that <PB N="308" REF="347"> which is to &s;ucceed it. This is a com|mon and
de&s;picable Ca&s;e, which loudly accu&s;es their Parents, who thus wretch|edly
hazard their Children's greate&s;t Concernment. And as it was a Fault in their
Parents to let their Children want tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ary Infu&s;ions, 'tis
&s;ure|ly &s;o in them&s;elves, to let their riper Years continue in that
Ignorance, ha|ving &s;carce ever thought of their Reli|gion, &s;ince they cou'd
their Le&s;&s;on to avoid Correction. And then 'tis no wonder if they pa&s;s in
the &s;ame Forget|fulne&s;s with other the Occurrences of that &s;lippery Age:
But if to &s;ome their Memory hath been &s;o faithful as to re|tain tho&s;e
early Impre&s;&s;ions which were made in it; yet alas, it avails little; for a
Man's Remembrance of his Creed may tell him there is a God, and that he is
Almighty; but if his Rea&s;on be &s;o much a&s;leep as not to infer from thence
the Nece&s;&s;ity of Reverencing and Obey|ing him, he may repeat the Creed
eve|ry Day, and yet be an Athei&s;t.</P>
<P>The Difficulty of removing what is imprinted in us by Education is
very hard; that which Men take in by Edu|cation being next to that which is
Na|tural; and mo&s;t Men owe the Principles <PB N="309" REF="348"> of their
Religion to their Education, or Climate wherein they were Born, being bred up
either to confirm tho&s;e Principles their Parents in&s;tilled into them, or by
a general Con&s;ent proceed in the Religion of their Country, there being a
Geography of Religions as well as Lands, and every Climate is not on|ly
di&s;tingui&s;h'd by their Laws and Li|mits, but circum&s;cribed by their
Do|ctrines, not con&s;idering whether true or fal&s;e, but only according to
their Intere&s;t: And if we con&s;ider the Lives of mo&s;t Men of all
Conditions, we &s;hall find the Honours and Plea&s;ures of the World, which we
renounced in Bap|ti&s;m, are the very Gods which &s;hare the World among&s;t
us.</P>
<P>Tho' we have &s;een Overturnings of States and Kingdoms, and great
Chan|ges, yet the true Church, that adores that God that was ever ador'd,
&s;ub&s;i&s;ts without Interruption, and that Religion which hath always been
oppo&s;ed, &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts. It hath many a Time been al|mo&s;t
extingui&s;hed, yet God hath al|ways been pleas'd to rai&s;e and recover it by
Wonders of his Goodne&s;s and Power; and what is al&s;o very ob&s;er|vable is,
That it hath never &s;ubmitted <PB N="310" REF="349"> to yield or bow to the
Will of Ty|rants, Let us but take a &s;erious View of the Apo&s;tles cho&s;en
by <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t:</HI> Tho&s;e Per&s;ons that were Ignorant and
Unlearned, of a &s;uddain were found &s;ufficiently able to put to Silence the
wi&s;e&s;t Philo&s;ophers, and Courageous enough to oppo&s;e the greate&s;t
Kings or Tyrants that re&s;i&s;ted the Chri&s;tian Re|ligion which they Taught
and Preach'd. If we &s;ee a Miracle, &s;ay &s;ome Men, we would be Converted;
they think there is no more in Conver&s;ion, but to believe there is a God,
when the De|vil does that and trembles; but true Conver&s;ion con&s;i&s;ts in
Humbling our &s;elves before the Saviour of the World, whom we have &s;o often
Povoked, and who might ju&s;tly every Minute de&s;troy us; to confe&s;s, we can
do nothing without him, and that we have de&s;er|ved nothing but his
Di&s;plea&s;ure. It con&s;i&s;ts in acknowledging that there is a great Enmity
betwixt God and us, and without a Mediator we could have had no Acce&s;s nor
Favour.</P>
<P>I know very well, that good Men may and often do blemi&s;h the
Repu|tation of their Piety, by over-acting &s;ome Things in Religion, by an
un|grateful <PB N="311" REF="350"> Au&s;terity and Sourne&s;s, which Religion
does not require; a &s;ub&s;tan|tial, di&s;creet and unaffected Piety makes no
great Noi&s;e nor Shew, but expre&s;&s;es it &s;elf in a con&s;tant &s;erious
Devotion, accompanied with good Works and Kindne&s;s, which makes a Man
plea&s;ing both to God and his Neighbour: Reli|gion makes Men obedient to
Govern|ment, and conformable to Laws; it makes Men Peaceable to each other, it
heals the Natures of Men, and &s;weetens their Spirits; it corrects their
Pa&s;&s;ions, and mortifies all tho&s;e Lu&s;ts, which are the Cau&s;es of
Enmity and Divi&s;ions: If Men would live as Religion requires they &s;hould
do, the World would be a quiet Habitation: And the true Rea|&s;on, why the
Societies of Men are &s;o full of Tumult and Di&s;order, is, Be|cau&s;e there
is &s;o little true Religion a|mong&s;t them; &s;o that if it were not for
&s;ome &s;mall Remainders of Piety and Virtue, which are yet &s;catter'd
among&s;t Mankind, humane Society would in a &s;hort Time disband and run into
Con|fu&s;ion, the Earth would grow wild and become a great Fore&s;t, and Men
would turn Bea&s;ts of Prey one towards the other: So that Religion hath &s;o
great <PB N="312" REF="351"> an Influence upon the Felicity of Man, that it
ought to be upheld out of Re|gard to their Temporal Peace and Pro|&s;perity, as
well as to their Eternal. Religion does qualify all Sorts of Men, and makes
them in Publick Affairs the more Serviceable, Governors apter to Rule with
Con&s;cience, and Inferiors for Con&s;cience Sake the willinger to Obey. And it
is a great Truth, That all Du|ties are by &s;o much the better perform'd by how
much the Men are more Reli|gious from who&s;e Abilities the &s;ame proceed; and
if Magi&s;trates, who are employ'd about the Publick Admini|&s;tration of
Ju&s;tice, follow it only as a Trade for Gain's-Sake, the Formality of
Ju&s;tice will then only &s;erve to &s;mo|ther Right, and that which was
nece&s;|&s;arily ordain'd for the common Good, will be the Cau&s;e of common
Mi&s;e|ry.</P>
<P>Religion has a Superiority above all other Things, and is as
nece&s;&s;ary to our living Happy in this World, as it is to our being Saved in
the next; with|out it a Man is an abandon'd Creature, one of the wor&s;t
Bea&s;ts Nature hath produced, and fit only for the Society of Wolves and
Bears, and therefore in <PB N="313" REF="352"> all Ages it hath been the
Foundation of Government. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">nd
therefore as no|thing is better for being Soure, it would be hard Religion
&s;hould be &s;o, which is the be&s;t of Things, and is &s;o Cheerful, and &s;o
far from being al|ways at odds with good Humour, that it is in&s;eparably
united to it, and no|thing of Unplea&s;antne&s;s belongs to it. A Virtue
&s;tuck with Bri&s;tles is too rough, it mu&s;t be adorned with &s;ome Flowers,
or el&s;e it will be unwillingly entertained; &s;o that even where it may be
fit to Strike, do it gently; and where one takes Care to do it, he would wound
others more, and hurt him&s;elf le&s;s by &s;oft Strokes, than by being har&s;h
and violent.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t People keep to that Religion which is grown up with them,
think|ing that the be&s;t; and the Rea&s;on of &s;taying in it upon that
Ground, is &s;omewhat &s;tronger for Women, than will be allow'd for Men, who
are bound to &s;earch the Truth.</P>
<P>Tho' Kings be Gods on Earth, yet they are Subjects of Heaven, and
ac|countable to God: Religion in a King &s;trengthens his Authority, it
procures Veneration, and gains a Reputation; <PB N="314" REF="353"> and in all
Publick Affairs, &s;o much Reputation is really &s;o much Power; and even in
Men of low Degree, Re|ligion will command &s;ome Reverence and Re&s;pect: But
in Per&s;ons of emi|nent Place and Dignity, it ca&s;ts a Lu|&s;tre upon them,
and by a &s;trong Re|flection doubles the Beams of Maje&s;ty; as the
clearne&s;s of the Eye di&s;po&s;es for a quicker Sight, &s;o the clearne&s;s
of the Mind di&s;po&s;es us to more perfect Acts of Religion. Few Things are
well learnt but by ea&s;y Precepts, tho&s;e well infu&s;ed will make them
Natural, and we are never &s;ure of retaining what is valuable, till by
continual Ha|bit we have made it a Piece of us.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t not think the Rewards of Heaven, like ripe Fruit upon a
full laden Bough, &s;hould &s;toop down to us, to be taken by every idle and
wanton Hand: That Heaven &s;hould be pro&s;ti|tuted to the lazy De&s;ires and
ordinary Endeavours of Slothful Men. God will not &s;o much di&s;parage eternal
Life and Happine&s;s, as to be&s;tow it upon tho&s;e who have &s;o low an
Opinion of it, as not to think it worth taking Pains for. We mu&s;t u&s;e our
be&s;t En|deavours, doing what we can, and <PB N="315" REF="354"> then we may
expect God's gracious A&s;&s;i&s;tance: But when Men expect Re|ligion &s;hould
co&s;t them no Pains, and that Happine&s;s &s;hould drop into their Laps
without any Labour on their Part, and that God &s;hould &s;natch them up into
Heaven when they Die, as he did the good Thief, they will at la&s;t find
them&s;elves much mi&s;taken in their Mea&s;ures: 'Tis trouble&s;ome at
fir&s;t, I confe&s;s, for a Man to begin a new Life; but when he begins to
habi|tuate him&s;elf to a Religious and Vir|tuous Life, the Trouble will &s;oon
go off, and un&s;peakable Plea&s;ure &s;ucceed in its Place. It was an
excellent Rule, which <HI>Pythagoras</HI> gave to his Schol|lars, <HI>Optimum
vitae genus eligito nam con&s;uetudo faciet jucundi&s;&s;imum: Re|&s;olve
always to do what is mo&s;t rea|&s;onable, and Cu&s;tom will &s;oon make it
Ea&s;ie.</HI> And tho&s;e, who upon Pretence of the Difficulties of Religion,
aban|don them&s;elves to a wicked Cour&s;e of Life, may ea&s;ily be convinced,
(tho' perhaps when 'tis too late) that they took more Pains to make
them&s;elves Mi&s;erable, than would have been to bring them to
Happine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="355">The Difference betwixt an Athei&s;t and an
Enthu&s;ia&s;t is this: The Athei&s;t thinks nothing Unlawful, as believing no
God to judge him: An Enthu&s;ia&s;t thinks every Thing that comes into his Head
not only Lawful, but the In&s;pi|ration of God, and as &s;uch is promp|ted with
a fiery Zeal to propagate it with the Hazard of his Life, the over|turning of
Government, and embroil|ing the World: And when a Man is once fully
po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with this Spirit, which works upon his Imagination, his
Rea&s;on is wholly clouded, his Di&s;cour&s;es are incon&s;i&s;tent, he has
nothing in his View but his pre&s;ent Impul&s;e, and as that alters, he
pur&s;ues the quite con|trary, with the &s;ame Vehemence, not reflecting that
it is oppo&s;ite to his former Sentiments. Now this is mo&s;t certainly a great
Exce&s;s of Pride, which yet recommends it &s;elf to many well|inclined and
religiou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed Peo|ple, under the Notion of Ab&s;traction from the
World, of Humility, and Self-Denial: For what greater Exalta|tion of ones
&s;elf can be imagin'd, and indeed Rebellion again&s;t God, than to think my
&s;elf exempted, upon account of my own Holine&s;s, from tho&s;e
In&s;ti|tutions <PB N="317" REF="356"> which God has appointed, and from that
Authority which he has or|dain'd among&s;t Men, and by who&s;e Hands he does
di&s;pence his Ble&s;&s;ings to us? What greater Delu&s;ion than to think, that
we can contrive a &s;horter and &s;afer Way to Heaven than that which God hath
commanded us? Not to be contented with that Station wherein he hath placed us,
but to rai&s;e our &s;elves above that Order by which he governs the World,

the Power of God to our &s;elves, to u&s;urp his Throne, and as far as in us
lies to take the Govern|ment of the World out of his Hands: All this is the
Effect of Enthu&s;ia&s;m: All the Loo&s;ene&s;s and Wickedne&s;s of this Age is

rewarded and puni&s;hed in this World; for in the next, all Publick Societies
will be di&s;&s;olved, and every Man &s;hall give an Account of him&s;elf to

<HEAD>Of KINGS and PRINCES, and the Education of a PRINCE.</HEAD>
<P>_THERE are found admira|ble Occurrences in the Lives of all Men, but
much more in Princes, who moving in a higher Sphere, their Acti|ons are more
con&s;picuous and worthy to be tran&s;mitted to Po&s;terity, as In|&s;tructive
to their Succe&s;&s;ors: And tho' Pro&s;perity is more agreeable to our
Na|ture, yet Adver&s;ity is more Benefi|cial, when Princes make a right
Im|provement of it, to &s;hun tho&s;e Rocks whereon &s;ome Princes have been
&s;plit.</P>
<P>It is very nece&s;&s;ary to accu&s;tom a young Prince to divert
him&s;elf among&s;t plea|&s;ant Men; one cannot find a more &s;ure and le&s;s
painful Way to render him a mo&s;t accompli&s;ht Prince, than having &s;uch
Courtiers about him in his Youth; (but the Difficulty is to find &s;uch:) A
Prince will not fail to learn in&s;en&s;ibly <PB N="321" REF="360"> the Manners
and Actions of tho&s;e; and what&s;oever he gains that way becomes Natural to
him. Tho&s;e that are near him &s;hould make u&s;e, as much as is po&s;&s;ible,
of that way to In&s;truct him; it being ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that
tho&s;e who have Wit, and are well-bred Men, &s;hould not only be receiv'd by
the Prince, but that Means be taken to find them out, for commonly &s;uch Men
are not over-forward to &s;hew them&s;elves: They know how to be Content with
their own &s;mall Fortunes; and be&s;ides, &s;uch Men are &s;o rarely met with,
that tho&s;e who under&s;tand them, need not fear to be troubled with too many
of them; for I do not remember, in all my Time, (who have &s;pent many Years in
the World) to have &s;een &s;o few of them as at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>To make a Prince &s;peak well, it is nece&s;&s;ary to mix a little
Art and Study, and a Prince ought to have &s;omething of both; for to the
compleating of a worthy hone&s;t Man, there is nothing more nece&s;&s;ary than
well-Speaking and well-Doing: What Gracefulne&s;s &s;o clear a Source gives to
all our Actions? How doth it beautifie our Words and Thoughts? How amiable a
Thing it is <PB N="322" REF="361"> to Speak well when Sincerity goes along with
it?</P>
<P>Young Princes are commonly more Active than Speculative, and mo&s;t
ea|&s;ily carried away with the Plea&s;ures of the World; yet there are &s;ome,
who by Nature are &s;erious enough, and are capable to retire into
them&s;elves, as King <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t, and King <HI>James</HI> the

young Prince the Apprehen&s;ion of certain Things with which Children are not
to entertain them&s;elves, as &s;urpa&s;&s;ing their ordinary Capacity; for
tho' a Child under&s;tands not at fir&s;t what is &s;aid to them, yet it
prepares him a|gain&s;t another time, and they are as lit|tle E&s;&s;ays of
Rea&s;on, which come not all at once. It is nece&s;&s;ary for him that would
attain Virtues, to begin gradually at the lowe&s;t Step, to guard his Sen&s;es,
and &s;et a watch upon the Avenues of his Pa&s;&s;ions, for Man becomes neither
perfectly Virtuous or Vitious all at once; and <HI>Je&s;us</HI> the Son of
<HI>Syrach</HI> hath &s;aid, <PB N="323" REF="362"> <HI>He that contemns little
Things &s;hall fall by little and little.</HI> The &s;malle&s;t Occa&s;ion
&s;uffices to &s;ay &s;omething that plea&s;es; and it is of much Importance to
form a Prince's Will agreeably, for then he will take Plea&s;ure to hearken to
a Man that hath Judgment and Wit, and will be de&s;irous to be in&s;tructed by
him: And if Per&s;ons about a Prince have a Grace in their Words and Acti|ons,
the Prince will retain the Manner how to behave and expre&s;s him&s;elf. This
agreeable way of Talking is of great Con&s;equence, and the &s;ure&s;t way to
acquire it, is to let &s;uch as have and practi&s;e it, come into the Prince's
Com|pany: Tho&s;e Princes who are young, and under&s;tand not all that's &s;aid
to them, want often that &s;ome Body put them in Mind; and when Princes keep
Com|pany with &s;uch, they take &s;ome Ob&s;er|vations which they &s;hould
never have of them&s;elves; and we our &s;elves find, if many Things had been
di&s;cover'd to us in our Youth, which we have &s;ince found by our own
Experience and Re|flections, we had &s;aved much Time; and one Word to the
Purpo&s;e then, had made us comprehend a World of Things, which we know not,
nor &s;hall ever know whil&s;t we live: But we reflect not 
<PB N="324" REF="363"> on tho&s;e Opportunities till we have lo&s;t them, and
we are not aware of them, till it be too late: All the World com|mits Faults,
but the greate&s;t are only perceived.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have the Education of young Princes &s;hould endeavour
to make them Love or Hate that, which de&s;erves the one or the other, that the
Prince may have a good Ta&s;te or Di&s;cernment, for this would make him
under&s;tand what he &s;hould Learn, and the Means to be excellent in it: For
if a Prince had be|forehand a right Apprehen&s;ion of Good and Evil, the very
Cour&s;e of Things would in&s;truct him, and the Aver&s;ion to what is Evil,
when&s;oever he &s;aw it, would be &s;ufficient to avoid it: A young Prince
cannot have too curious a Ta&s;te to di&s;cern betwixt true and fal&s;e
Plea|&s;ures, and not to be deceiv'd in either. The mo&s;t agreeable way of
in&s;tructing, is, to do that Well, which we &s;ee others do Ill, by which we
make our Life more ea&s;ie: Be&s;ides, tho&s;e that are about a young Prince,
&s;hould endeavour, that the Wit and Heart of the Prince &s;hould be
di&s;po&s;ed as they ought to be: 'Tis true that Wit finds out the way to
at|tain Perfection, but the Heart is nece&s;|&s;ary to put in Practice what is
judged <PB N="325" REF="364"> to be the <HI>Be&s;t</HI>; and that which we call
the having a good Ta&s;te or Di&s;cernment is oftene&s;t found in a young
Prince, who is u&s;ually born with more than an ordinary Genius; tho' a late
Emi|nent Philo&s;opher holds, That all Chil|dren Naturally have near the &s;ame
Ca|pacity, and that the chief Difference proceeds from the Care that is taken
to inform Children: But I think the fir&s;t Advantage is rather to be
a&s;cribed to a happy Birth, and that Art does af|terwards perfect it; and I
have always believed we &s;hould not &s;o much wi&s;h for any thing in a young
Prince, as Wit, it being impo&s;&s;ible not to have it, if he be Educated in
the Company of &s;ome People; as to the learning by <HI>ones</HI> &s;elf, it
very &s;eldom happens that the Mind, without &s;ome extraordinary Help, takes
the right Cour&s;e to do it: 'Tis true indeed, our late King <HI>Charles</HI>
the Second was a very excellent and knowing Man, and had a great In&s;ight into
Men and Manners; tho' in his Youth, by the Rea&s;on of our inte&s;tine
Troubles, and the Rebellion rai&s;ed a|gain&s;t his Royal Father, he was Taught
very little; yet he had an excellent Go|vernor in his tender Years, which was
the Marquis of <HI>Hartford,</HI> and after him, <PB N="326" REF="365"> the
Earl of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI>; but when that Prince went Generali&s;&s;imo into
the <HI>We&s;t</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> his Highne&s;s had the poor|e&s;t and
<HI>weake&s;t</HI> Man for his Governor that I ever &s;aw; yet they who had
In|tere&s;t in the Prince, and were near a|bout him, in&s;tructed him in &s;o
plea&s;ant a Way, that he was mo&s;t agreeable in Conver&s;ation; And when he
came to the Throne, if he had loved Bu&s;ine&s;s as well as he under&s;tood it,
he had been one of the greate&s;t Princes of the la&s;t Age; but he was wholly
addicted to his Plea&s;ures, and Chamber-Practice, which much &s;hortned his
Days; and yet he may be reckon'd among&s;t the mo&s;t admir'd Princes of his
Time, who had form'd and in&s;tructed him&s;elf a|mong&s;t the be&s;t-bred
Princes in <HI>Eu|rope.</HI></P>
<P>A young Prince &s;hould never be over burthen'd with a long Chain of
In&s;tru|ctions; his Tutor &s;hould rather chu&s;e to &s;peak few Things, and
let each Pre|cept take its Effect, and &s;hould give the Prince a Rea&s;on of
all he tells him; &s;o that the Prince of his own Accord might in&s;en&s;ibly
make the Application to him|&s;elf; it being much better to enlighten his
Under&s;tanding, than to charge his Memory.</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="366">And above all Things, he &s;hould teach the
Prince to be Free and Affable, which Virtues make Princes to be belov'd; and it
is of great Con&s;equence for a young Prince to have the Art of ma|king
him&s;elf be belov'd: When Maje&s;ty and Civility are mix'd together, it makes
Men find with Plea&s;ure that &s;uch Princes are their Ma&s;ters. The more
Princes conde&s;cend, the more ready are their Servants to &s;ubmit,
e&s;pecially if they be well-bred Per&s;ons, who never pre&s;ume too much. The
mo&s;t Eminent Princes were wont to communicate freely, and were very familiar:
<HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> was &s;o with his own Soldiers, which &s;o charm'd them, that
when they fought for his Glory, they found nothing difficult, and were not
apprehen&s;ive of Danger, (Heaven takes tho&s;e Hearts into its Protection,)
and in fighting Fifty Battels, which <HI>Cae|&s;ar</HI> did without lo&s;ing
one, he was always very Active, and yet never re|ceiv'd any Hurt: Such Princes
are al|ways belov'd; and tho' Fortune (which is ever incon&s;tant) leaves their
Side, yet Glory and Honour never for&s;ake them.</P>
<P><HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> was of this Number: He had nothing in him, which
&s;avour'd not of Grandeur; he was brave and full of <PB N="328" REF="367">
Civility; he would hazard his own Per|&s;on, to &s;ave the meane&s;t of his
Soldiers. He lov'd all tho&s;e that loved his Fortune; he &s;har'd with them
the Glory, as he did the Danger; he under&s;tood well how to make him&s;elf be
Belov'd, <HI>&V;t Ameris, Ama,</HI> which is a &s;ure way if it be perform'd
hand&s;omely; the principal Secret con&s;i&s;ts in managing it &s;o, that the
Per&s;ons whom one loves &s;hould be glad of it.</P>
<P>There is nothing &s;o much to be fear'd in a young Prince, as giving
him an ill Ma&s;ter; for the be&s;t Natural Parts would be but of little u&s;e,
if Care be not taken to improve them: One can never take any thing right
without having learnt it; and who can believe that either to do a Thing well,
or to do it better, if one doth it well, that Study can ever hinder it: We
&s;ee in all Exerci&s;es, how much good Ma&s;ters are nece&s;&s;ary; and it
were very &s;trange, that the Body &s;hould be capable of In&s;truction, and
not the Mind; for what likelyhood is there, that Practice and good Ma&s;ters
are effectual to make a young Man skillful in riding the Great Hor&s;e, and
that to the making of an accompli&s;h'd Per&s;on, they &s;hould both be
needle&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="368">The Body and the Mind are &s;el|dom as one
would wi&s;h; but the De|fects of the Body &s;eem more difficult to be
corrected; for the Mind is na|turally &s;upple, and may be redre&s;s'd if a
right Cour&s;e be taken; and the Rea|&s;on why it falls out otherwi&s;e is,
when we learn to do a Thing of an ill Ma&s;ter, one learns to do it ill; and it
is much more difficult to chu&s;e good Ma&s;ters for framing the Mind, than for
the Body, for the Advantages of the Bo|dy are much more remarkable than tho&s;e
of the Mind: To be able and well|bred to &s;uch a Degree as one would have a
great Prince, one cannot know too many Things, if we have Skill to make a right
U&s;e of them, and know how to Value them; but to have read much, or to have
learnt a Number of different Opinions, di&s;covers nothing of Certainty; for we
know nothing well but what we &s;ee clearly, and that which we can make others
&s;ee pre&s;ently, and under&s;tand if they be clear-&s;ighted, and we &s;hould
mi&s;tru&s;t all which we &s;ee as through a Cloud, and which we cannot make
plain to the Sight of another. There are &s;ome Princes who would have been
very gallant Men, if Care had been taken at fir&s;t to put them in a right way,
<PB N="330" REF="369"> and to have &s;hew'd them what was to be done. For a
great Prince, upon whom the Happine&s;s of the Publick de|pends, by who&s;e
Example his People will fa&s;hion them&s;elves, as being the mo&s;t noble
Model, no Care in the World &s;hould be neglected: The Bu&s;ine&s;s is to make
a young Prince Happy, and that all who live under him may be &s;o; it being
rea&s;onable that tho&s;e &s;hould a little &s;hare in the Happine&s;s who are
in Duty ob|liged to Sacrifice them&s;elves for pro&s;ecu|ting of it; and
therefore this fir&s;t Point of their Education is of much greater Im|portance
to them, than to private Per|&s;ons: For when Princes are no longer under the
Conduct of Governors, all that they do, or &s;ay, is approv'd, or at lea&s;t it
is &s;o in Appearance; For no Per&s;on comes into their Pre&s;ence but with a
de&s;ign to plea&s;e them, becau&s;e altho' he loves them, yet one ea&s;ily
inclines to love their Favour more; and it were a great Imprudence for any Man
to draw the Hatred of his Prince upon him&s;elf, and to advi&s;e him as he
would one of his particular Friends, unle&s;s at fir&s;t the Prince had
&s;ignified his Plea&s;ure to have it &s;o: However, tho&s;e Per&s;ons that are
near about Princes that be young, (if they are not too much &s;way'd by
Inte|re&s;t) <PB N="331" REF="370"> may very &s;ecurely tell them in an
agreeable manner, all which may con|tribute to their Glory and Happine&s;s:
'Tis certain, a very ea&s;ie Thing to give them good Advice as to their Glory,
but it is not &s;o to their Happine&s;s, which depends more upon the Tem|per;
and who&s;oever will a&s;certain a Prince what will make him happy, mu&s;t know
him perfectly well, for mo&s;t com|monly we our &s;elves know not what would be
be&s;t for our own Happine&s;s: But when all is done, it &s;eems to me, that
with a very little Help, it were no difficult Thing for a young Prince to be
happy.</P>
<P>Certainly, that young Prince is in a fair way to it, who &s;ees
him&s;elf one of the fir&s;t among&s;t the Ma&s;ters of the World, and that
Fortune hath nothing greater to give. And therefore Princes &s;hould con&s;ider
what Plea&s;ure it is to do good, that there is nothing more Noble, and that
this Delight was made only for Princes. For the more Fa|vours they be&s;tow,
the more they are in Condition to grant, provided their Gifts be with Choice
and E&s;teem, which &s;upports their Grandeur, and renders them more Powerful:
It is not Riches that are principally de&s;ir'd from Kings, but 
<PB N="332" REF="371"> Employments and Tru&s;ts, and that which makes Men
de&s;ire high Com|mands, is not for Conveniency of Life, for their Lives are by
them made more trouble&s;ome; but it is Hopes of making it appear, that they
have Merit in them and are u&s;eful to the Publick; and when ju&s;t Per&s;ons
that have Worth and Fide|lity are put into Employments, they make them&s;elves
&s;oon known, and their Princes are well &s;erv'd: We have lately &s;een in
<HI>England,</HI> a &s;ad Example of ta|king fal&s;e Mea&s;ures herein; the ill
Choice of our late King's Mini&s;ters was his Ruin: Be&s;ides, what greater
Slavery can there be, than that Princes are chain'd to their Po&s;ts, and
cannot make them&s;elves <HI>le&s;s,</HI> all their Words and Actions are
de&s;cant|ed upon, and made publick Di&s;cour&s;e. A Prince cannot with Dignity
quit his Guards. Fortune hath him in Cu&s;tody, a Train be&s;ets him where-ever
he goes, and there is no making an E&s;cape, but &s;till he that is the
Ma&s;ter of many is the Servant of more.</P>
<P>The great and honourable Fame of a King in this World depends more
upon his wi&s;e Admini&s;tration than upon his private Morals; the Goodne&s;s
of his Government depends chiefly upon tho&s;e that advi&s;e him, and execute
under him; it being an infallible Maxim, <HI>That he</HI> <PB N="333" REF="372"> <HI>is the wor&s;t (at lea&s;t the mo&s;t unhappy) King, who hath
the wor&s;t Councellors and Mini&s;ters under him.</HI></P>
<P>Princes &s;hould endeavour to couple Warlike and peaceable Virtues
together, to know at all times how to Rule their own State, and protect their
Subjects; to honour the Good, and cha&s;ti&s;e the Wicked; to change the
Plea&s;ures of the Body into tho&s;e of the Mind, to &s;eek their Content in
the Acqui&s;ition of tho&s;e Things which may rai&s;e them above o|ther
Per&s;ons: But this Perfection is not ea&s;ily met with at Court, where every
Thing &s;tands in Oppo&s;ition to good De|&s;igns; Princes are born to govern,
and therefore they mu&s;t govern well, with|out amu&s;ing them&s;elves with
Knowledge more curious than u&s;eful, which would better become a Profe&s;&s;or
of Philo&s;o|phy than a Prince.</P>
<P>There is no doubt but Sciences do adorn the Titles of Princes, as
Diadems do their Heads, and Jewels their Crowns, but the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary
Philo&s;ophy for a Prince, is to know how to do Ju&s;tice to his People, and to
defend them from their Enemies, and to under&s;tand what Per&s;ons are able to
&s;erve him well; ne|verthele&s;s many Princes enter upon the Government before
they have pa&s;s'd an <PB N="334" REF="373"> Apprenti&s;hip for it, and take
lea&s;t Care of what concerns them mo&s;t.</P>
<P>Foreign Languages are mo&s;t nece&s;|&s;ary for a Prince, and
&s;erve for a great Ornament to him; the Princes Electors of <HI>Germany</HI>
would admit no Man here|tofore to the Imperial Dignity, unle&s;s he was able to
&s;peak <HI>Latin, Italian, Sclavonian</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI>; and the
Empe|ror <HI>Frederick</HI> the Second could be&s;ides &s;peak elegant
<HI>French, Spani&s;h</HI> and <HI>Tur|ki&s;h,</HI> which was very rare in his
time: He was al&s;o skilful in the ancient vulgar <HI>Greek</HI>; and indeed
the Intercour&s;e of Princes, who live upon the Continent, permits them not to
neglect the&s;e Lan|guages without running a great Incon|veniency. The
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Genius for clear &s;peaking and writing is always to the
Point; they look upon rambling Di&s;|cou&s;es with Contempt, and as Men of
Rea&s;on, they &s;tand more upon Strength of Argument, than all the Pomp of
Rhe|torick, not &s;o much concern'd to move the Hearer's Affections, as to warm
his Rea&s;on. Perhaps no Nation is more Satyrical and quicker in Repar|tees,
which argues Wit to expre&s;s them|&s;elves &s;ignificantly; we have a mo&s;t
hap|py Language, compounded chiefly of <HI>Saxon, Latin</HI> and
<HI>French,</HI> of which <PB N="335" REF="374"> <HI>Saxon</HI> is the Stock,
the other two being ingrafted into it. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> is &s;o
&s;ignificant that it does almo&s;t equalize the <HI>Greek,</HI> and does even
exceed the <HI>Latin,</HI> in a particular Grace of com|pounding Words, which
is as great a Beauty as can be in Language. In Point of Sweetne&s;s, the
<HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Ita|lian</HI> run &s;moother, but they want Sinews,
e&s;pecially the la&s;t. The <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> is Ma|je&s;tical but
boi&s;terous; the High-<HI>Dutch</HI> Manly, but very har&s;h; whereas the
<HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> is both &s;weet and manly. If we look upon the famous Men
of our Nation, which have been Learned, or Soldiers, we &s;hall find many very
famous, as Venerable <HI>Bede,</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Moor,</HI> Lord <HI>Bacon,
Smith, Spelman, Camden, Selden, Daniel, Drayton, Ben. John&s;on, Shake|&s;pear,
Beaumont, Fletcher,</HI> Sir <HI>Philip Sidney, Cowley, Oldham, Dryden,</HI>
and ma|ny others. But is impo&s;&s;ible to learn Lan|guages without travelling,
which em|belli&s;hes the Minds of tho&s;e that u&s;e it prudently: A young
Prince that travels will under&s;tand Nations, imitate what they have of good,
and avoid the re&s;t; he &s;hould heedfully regard the Laws and Fundamental
Maxims of State, the Inclinations of Sovereigns, their Reve|nues, the Order of
their Courts, their <PB N="336" REF="375"> Alliances, their Power, and their
Fa|vourites; that Prince who hath &s;een <HI>Europe</HI> with Judgement knows
every thing that can carry him to glorious Acti|ons, and certainly a young
Prince that travils, profits more in two Years, than if he had &s;tay'd in his
Study ten Years; Travel teaches them to under&s;tand the Plenty of Countries,
the Force of Ri|vers, and which are the mo&s;t eminent Places of Traffick and
Commerce, the Convenience of Bridges, the di&s;tance of Places, the Strength
and Situation of Cities and Ca&s;tles, the Number of the People, the
Inclination of the Subjects, the Humour of Princes, the Sympathy and Antipathy
of Nations, and many other things which may in&s;truct a General of an Army to
fortifie Places, to entrench, to Camp an Army advan|tagiou&s;ly, to draw up a
Body of Men in Battle, to lead an Army to fight, and to &s;hew them&s;elves
eminent Examples to their Followers. Travel al&s;o gives a Prince Le&s;&s;ons
of Temperance, Mode|&s;ty and Patience; and the Languages which are u&s;eful to
all Men are mo&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;ary to Princes, and to tho&s;e who would have any
Command of Armies. <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> is the noble&s;t of all Ba&s;tard
Lan|guages, it not being a Mother-Tongue, <PB N="337" REF="376"> but compounded
of <HI>Latin, Gothick, A|rabick</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>: The <HI>Romans,
Goths</HI> and <HI>Moors,</HI> having reign'd &s;ome Ages in that Country, did
introduce a Mix|ture of all tho&s;e Languages. A Prince &s;hould al&s;o learn
the Mathematicks, which will teach him to be&s;iege, and fortifie Places.
The&s;e are the mo&s;t needful Studies for a Prince, and not to &s;pend his
time upon Logical Noti|ons, but to chu&s;e &s;uch Studies as are proportionable
to his Condition: It is &s;ufficient that a Prince be ready in &s;a|cred and
prophane Hi&s;tory; that he take a Delight in &s;ome Books, and &s;ometimes
con&s;ult the dead, who will &s;ay that which none of the living dare &s;ay to
him; he &s;hould read &s;uch Books as may teach him to know the Condi|tion of
his Friends and Enemies; he &s;hould learn Principles of Genero&s;ity and
Honour di&s;tinctly; to know tho&s;e that love the Publick Good and
Inte|re&s;t, and to favour them with &s;uch Of|fices as they de&s;erve, and to
puni&s;h them that do otherwi&s;e: And tho' it be honourable for Kings to
aggrandize their be&s;t De&s;erving Subjects, yet a Prince ought not to
diffu&s;e his Graces too pro|digally, lea&s;t the Servant &s;hould become the
Ma&s;ter; which in all Courts, and at <PB N="338" REF="377"> all times hath
proved very prejudicial. The Planets would have little Regard to the Sun, if
they had no need of his Light, nor a Servant of his Ma&s;ter, if he could do
him no good; Princes ought therefore to be circum&s;pect in Di&s;tribution of
their Favours, if they would not lo&s;e that Honour and Re|&s;pect which their
Subjects give them. A King gives an Account of his Acti|ons to none but God; he
ought ne|verthele&s;s to act equitably, and not to plunge brave Men into
De&s;pair, than which nothing is more dangerous, who having lo&s;t their
E&s;tates by their mo&s;t faithful and long Services, thinking they have
nothing more to lo&s;e, are capable to make the greate&s;t report of their
Wrongs; 'tis true, Kings may take the Benefits be&s;towed, when they that
received them become unworthy of them; but before a King comes to that
Extremi|ty, he &s;hould endeavour to reduce them to their Duty, and having
tried all fair Ways, the Prince mu&s;t be careful not faintly to execute his
Re&s;olution, nor ra&s;hly to enter upon a great Action, which in Prudence he
mu&s;t afterwards abandon. A Prince &s;hould think &s;eri|ou&s;ly of a Thing
before he enters up|on it, but having begun, he &s;hould car|ry 
<PB N="339" REF="378"> it through, for there is nothing more repugnant to
Authority of Kings than to act by halfs, nor any thing that en|courages
Subjects &s;o much to Rebelli|on as to &s;ee their Ma&s;ters are afraid of
them. A Prince ought to &s;pend &s;ome Time in reading, e&s;pecially Hi&s;tory,
which will render him able and know|ing, and it is a good Guide, and what
concerns Life which it does antidate, and makes the Reader contemporary with
the Times pa&s;t, and by running up beyond his Nativity, the Prince will be
&s;omething the wi&s;er for it, and will have a Stock of Sen&s;e, without much
Trouble of his own; and it is of great U&s;e to per&s;wade by Example that
which we have a Mind to. Hi&s;tory is a kind of Experience, and we may reap
much by it; be&s;ides there are &s;ome Hi&s;tories written by &s;o good Hands,
which tho' we know, yet it is a Plea&s;ure to read them, as <HI>Thucidides,
Polibius, Cae&s;ar</HI>'s <HI>Commentaries,</HI> with the Duke of
<HI>Ro|han</HI> and Sir <HI>Clement Edmond</HI>'s Ob&s;erva|tions upon them,
and <HI>Hugo Grotius de Jure Pacis &amp; Belli,</HI> and <HI>Selden</HI>'s
<HI>Mare clau&s;um</HI>; but to read over much, and to be con&s;tantly poring
upon Books, brings neither Plea&s;ure nor Profit. Read|ing too much
over-charges Nature; it <PB N="340" REF="379"> is Thought and Dige&s;tion that
makes Reading profitable, which being well managed gives a great In&s;ight into
all Things. He that depends upon his own Experience, hath but a few Mate|rials
to work upon, and to take Mea|&s;ures wholly from Books without look|ing into
Men and Bu&s;ine&s;s, is like tra|velling in a Map, where only Countries and
Cities are well di&s;tingui&s;h'd; but Villages and private Hou&s;es are
&s;eldom or never marked.</P>
<P>Young Princes, after &s;ome Hours in their Study, &s;hould be&s;tow
&s;ome others upon Sports, becau&s;e the Mind being taken up too long with
Contemplation will di&s;reli&s;h Study, if it be not refre&s;h|ed with &s;ome
Recreations, in which Hunting is one of the mo&s;t agreeable to Princes; and
becau&s;e Youth runs ea&s;i|ly down the Hill towards Plea&s;ures, therefore
Princes &s;hould &s;ometimes play at Tennis; tho' mo&s;t commonly young Princes
would rather endure the Pains of Hunting a whole Day than &s;tudy|ing but two
Hours, which they think a Labour, which is really nothing but pure Delight, and
Studying would be a &s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ure, if the Mind were capable of any in
tho&s;e younger Years. For tho&s;e that have once ta&s;ted it can 
<PB N="341" REF="380"> never take them&s;elves off again in &s;uch Manner that
they become de&s;picable and good for nothing el&s;e. As for Ex|erci&s;es,
Hunting has always been the Recreation of Princes, nor never di&s;e|&s;teemed
but by tho&s;e that know not the Benefit of it. It withdraws the great Men
about the Prince from Idle|ne&s;s, which is the Mother of all Vi|ces, or from
Gaming, which is un&s;uit|able to their Condition: It makes Prin|ces &s;trong,
active and bold. Almo&s;t all Princes love Hunting, and apply them|&s;elves to
it, becau&s;e it is a Repre&s;enta|tion of War; a good Hunt&s;man is, or may
ea&s;ily be a good Soldier. To &s;ur|prize the Wolf or the Fox, a Man mu&s;t
u&s;e a certain Subtilty, which teaches us to lay Ambu&s;hes for the Enemy. To
take a wild Boar, one mu&s;t know how to pre&s;ent the Boar Spear to
Ad|vantage, ju&s;t as one would do a Pike or a Halbert when two Bodies of
Sol|diers come to pu&s;h of Pike. To &s;hoot a Deer or Hare running, a Patridge
or a Quale flying, one mu&s;t be as good a Mark&s;-man as the be&s;t Fu&s;ileer
in the Army; be&s;ides, Hunting enures a Prince to endure Hunger, Thir&s;t,
Heat, Cold, Rain, Snow, and all the Incommodities of <PB N="342" REF="381"> the
Air, without which it is impo&s;&s;ible to be a good Soldier.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, Princes &s;hould endeavour to couple Moral and Martial
Virtues to|gether: I know Liberality is counted the proper Virtue of a Prince,
it being much better for him to be Profu&s;e than Covetuous, Prodigality having
a re&s;em|blance of &s;omething more noble than Avarice, and really it is
le&s;s odious: Nay, tho&s;e that gain by it make it pa&s;s for a Virtue; but
perhaps it is more pre|judicial to Po&s;terity, and more dange|rous than the
other Extream: For tho' a King &s;hould give away his whole King|dom, he would
not &s;atisfie all that ask: No, nor all that think they de&s;erve much of him:
It is then more convenient to give with Rea&s;on, and never to draw &s;o near
the Bottom, but that the Prince may always have wherewith to gratifie Per&s;ons
of Merit; and above all, the Prince &s;hould take &s;pecial Care, that his
Liberalities be exerci&s;ed without op|pre&s;&s;ing his People, to avoid
Murmu|ring, which is the ready way to pro|duce Rebellion. But there is little
need at this Time of making Laws again&s;t giving too much, Princes are not too
free in this Age; and there are not many that want an Over&s;eer in 
<PB N="343" REF="382"> this kind, e&s;pecially in our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Court.
It is certain, that Kings, by the Eminency of their Places, are highly obliged
to Integrity, becau&s;e the lea&s;t Blemi&s;h in them grows up to a mon&s;trous
Deformity. They are the <HI>Primum Mobile</HI> upon which all other Orbs
depend; and <HI>A&s;&s;iadorus</HI> &s;ays it were more credible that Nature
&s;hould Err, than for a Prince to frame a Commonwealth different from the
Con&s;titution of his own Life; he being a Gla&s;s i&s;&s;uing forth Incentives
to Imitation; and where that is wanting, the Government cannot long
&s;ub&s;i&s;t. Was not <HI>Rome</HI> Warlike under <HI>Romulus,</HI> Religious
under <HI>Numa,</HI> Con|tinent under <HI>Fabricius,</HI> Di&s;&s;olute under
<HI>Lucullus</HI> and <HI>Antony,</HI> Idolatrous under <HI>Julian,</HI>
Immerged in <HI>Ariani&s;m</HI> under <HI>Valens?</HI> To &s;hew that People
are always moulded into the Temper of their Prince, and where that is not, the
Government is &s;hort. And we find in Holy Writ, Judgment threatned to Princes,
who have been a Snare in&s;tead of a Sanctua|ry to their Subjects: And St.
<HI>Augu&s;tin</HI> calls them the wor&s;t of Homicides, in de&s;troying the
Souls of their Subjects; and therefore that King who under|&s;tands his Duty to
God, cannot be ig|norant, how many Obligations of Vir|tue <PB N="344" REF="383"> are annexed to a Crown, &s;ince the Lives of his Subjects are
&s;haded under his Protection; and &s;ince a King medi|ates between God and his
People, it is as nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould adhere fir&s;t to God, as he
would have his People be faithful to him; &s;o that he mu&s;t in the fir&s;t
Place con&s;ecrate him&s;elf, next his Kingdom, to the Service of his Creator;
and whoever does not this, he overturns both Divine and Humane Laws: Kings are
not to be e&s;teemed Happy for their Conque&s;ts, but by u&s;ing their Power in
the Advancement of God's Honour and Service. The Royal Dignity is not
&s;ufficiently great of it &s;elf to render him Happy that injoys it, by the
&s;ole con&s;idering what he is; for if a King be left alone without any
Com|pany, to think of him&s;elf at Lei&s;ure, he will find him&s;elf to be a
Man full of Mi&s;eries, and that feels them as well as other common Per&s;ons;
and therefore carefully to avoid this, there never fail to be near the
Per&s;ons of Kings a great many that continually watch to make Diverti&s;ements
for Princes, and &s;upply their lei&s;ure Time, with Plea&s;ures and
Pa&s;times, that none of their Time may be vacant; which is to &s;ay, that
Kings are encompa&s;&s;ed round with Per&s;ons that <PB N="345" REF="384"> are
very careful Kings &s;hould not be alone to think of them&s;elves, knowing very
well that a King, as he is, he would be very Mi&s;erable if he &s;hould be left
alone; and indeed, the chief thing that &s;upports Men in great Employments is,
that they are perpetually hindred from Thinking of them&s;elves, for it is the
Noi&s;e and Bu&s;tle that divert us, and is mo&s;t grateful; Men have a
&s;ecret In&s;tinct that intices them to &s;eek Diverti&s;ements, which
proceeds from the continual Sen&s;e of their Mi&s;ery, and they feel another
&s;ecret In&s;tinct that remains from the Greatne&s;s of their fir&s;t Nature,
which makes them know that their Happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts only in Re&s;t; and
the&s;e two con|trary In&s;tincts flatter them, that the Sa|tisfaction they
expect will come, by open|ing the Door that will admit them to Re&s;t, which is
u&s;ually &s;ought by &s;trug|gling with &s;ome Oppo&s;ition in vain: And
therefore <HI>Cyneas</HI> the Philo&s;opher &s;aid well to <HI>Pyrrhus,</HI>
who promi&s;ed he would enjoy his Plea&s;ures with his Friends, when he had
conquered a good Part of the World: But <HI>Cyneas</HI> told him, he would do
better to advance his own Happine&s;s by injoying that Re&s;t pre&s;ent|ly,
than to &s;eek it by &s;o many Troubles; but <HI>Pyrrhus</HI> could not be
Happy, either <PB N="346" REF="385"> before or after Conquering a great Part of
the World; and the &s;en&s;ual Life his Mini&s;ters advi&s;ed him to was le&s;s
able to content him, than the Agitation of &s;o great Wars, and &s;o many
Voyages as he de&s;igned.</P>
<P>'Tis certain, Man hunts after Felici|ty in all his Actions; for all
Men de&s;ire to be Happy, and what ever different Means they u&s;e, all tends
to this End; it is the &s;ame De&s;ire in both, that in|clines one to go the
War, and the other not to go; the Will doth never move one Step, but with
regard to this Object of Felicity: It is the true and real Mo|tive of all Men's
Actions; nay, even of tho&s;e that Hang them&s;elves: When Peo|ple believe
their Prince is Liberal, Va|liant, and Prudent, they will more rea|dily obey
his Will and receive his Com|mands with Re&s;pect; but to gain the Reputation
of being a Prudent Prince, he &s;hould be very careful that his Mini|&s;ters
and Servants be Friends to the Publick Good, that they be Affable, Mode&s;t and
Generous: The Prince mu&s;t &s;hew a con&s;tant Re&s;olution to maintain his
People in their ancient Splendour: That Adver&s;ity ca&s;t him not down, nor
Pro&s;perity make him In&s;olent; and to give a fairer Lu&s;tre to his
Liberality, <PB N="347" REF="386"> he &s;hould take Care that what he be&s;tows
do not ari&s;e out of the Oppre&s;&s;ion of any, and being &s;uch without
drawing his Sword, or giving much to his Sub|jects, his Friends and Enemies too
will e&s;teem him Valiant, Liberal, and Pru|dent, and all of them fearing to
offend him, will pay him the Duties of Sub|jects, Friends and Neighbours; and
he need not doubt but God will di&s;&s;ipate his Enemies, and all the mutinous
ma|licious De&s;igns of his malicious Subjects and ambitious Neighbours.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t know that Kings are con&s;i|dered in a double Capacity,
that of Na|ture and that of Policy; the Politick Body never dies, and is never
defective of Authority or Direction; the Acts of the Body Politick are not
abated by the Natural Body's Acce&s;s. The Body Po|litick is not di&s;abled to

<HI>Droit, Placit.</HI> 24. in the Sixth Year of King <HI>Edward</HI> the

<HI>Ri|chard</HI> the Second, the Exceptions of Nonage again&s;t the King was
not ad|mitted; <PB N="348" REF="387"> for tho' the Natural Body dies, the

good, tho' he had not Age to di&s;cern what he did, being then in the Hands of
his Uncle the Protector; and if Catholicks &s;hould pretend to make void the

<P>_THE Tran&s;actions of this World are the mo&s;t unplea|&s;ant
Speculations that ever entertained my Mind; the whole Off-&s;pring of Nature
moveth as at fir&s;t, but only Man, who was de&s;ign'd Ma&s;ter of the whole,
runs a Cour&s;e contrary to all Order, and the whole Progeny of <HI>Adam</HI>
is obnoxious to his Original Guilt. We have innate Affections and
Propen&s;ities to do Evil, &s;ince our fir&s;t Mother's Conver&s;e with the
Serpent, and the &s;ad Effects of <HI>A|dam</HI>'s Fate are derived to all; but
yet no Evil is in us, but the Cure is in our own Power; no poi&s;onous Herb
&s;prouts out, but in the &s;ame Field its Antidote is placed. It is therefore
a Wonder that Men who know they have rational Souls, &s;hould only follow the
Dictates of Sen&s;e, and for one Hour of Plea&s;ure here, &s;uf|fer an Eternity
of Torments hereafter; for by embracing our Heady Appetites, we have chang'd
the whole Ma&s;s of our Nature, and have &s;et our &s;elves a diame|trical 
<PB N="350" REF="389"> Oppo&s;ition to all that is called good; &s;o that all
our Actions are impertinent, and we level our De&s;igns at a fal&s;e End, and
we wander in tho&s;e Paths which will lead us to the Gates of
De&s;truction.</P>
<P>The Enjoyment of what the World affords is that we only &s;eek
after. The Devil began with the&s;e in his fir&s;t Temp|tation of <HI>Eve</HI>
in Paradi&s;e; and it &s;eems he had not, four thou&s;and Years after, found
out three better Engines for his Turn than the&s;e; for he u&s;ed the very
&s;ame in the Wilderne&s;s to our Saviour, <HI>the promi&s;ed Seed of the
Woman,</HI> that he had prevail'd with on <HI>Eve</HI> her &s;elf in
Paradi&s;e, &s;o long before. <HI>Make the&s;e Stones bread</HI>; there's the
Lu&s;t of the Fle&s;h. <HI>He &s;hews him all the Kingdoms of the World,</HI>
there's the Lu&s;t of the Eyes: <HI>Ca&s;t thy &s;elf down from the Pin|nacle,
the Angels are thy Guard to bear thee up in their Hands</HI>; there's the Pride
of Life. 'Tis true, the Devil can do no more but tempt us, his Power (how|ever
great) is limited, tho' we cannot ea&s;ily &s;et out the Bounds of it; he has
his Chains of Re&s;traint, as well as Tor|ment: It &s;eems an Inva&s;ion of
God's Prerogative, and a giving the Devil more than his Due, to allow him a
Power of immediate and impre&s;&s;ive <PB N="351" REF="390"> Injection into our
Minds, without the Help of our own innate Corruptions; for 'tis by the&s;e we
hold the Candle to him, and the Wedge too of the Temp|tation whil&s;t he drives
it; the Mud is &s;till in the Bottom, he does but &s;tir it up by &s;haking it,
or drawing it forth by &s;ome outward Objects. There is no ea&s;ier Way to
out-reach a Man, than to out-end him. If once the Devil can get a Man to
&s;hoot with him in his own Bow, and make his Engines a Man's End, the Match is
lo&s;t (as we u&s;e to &s;ay) in the very making.</P>
<P>Now if any Man will but &s;eriou&s;ly try, he &s;hall find it more
po&s;&s;ible to with-hold his Affection from the Things of this World, than
enjoy the Satisfacti|on of his Ta&s;te in it. <HI>Socrates</HI> had more true
Joy in &s;afely looking on all the O|lympick Games, and thanking the Gods, that
they had made him not to need the many things they had made for o|thers
Pur&s;uits, than <HI>Alcibiades</HI> in his ha|zardous obtaining them, which
made <HI>Socrates</HI> cry out, <HI>Quos diderunt dii qui|bus non indigeo.</HI>
'Tis worth our Ob&s;er|vation to con&s;ider the Toil that &s;uch Men take, who
are in love with the Plea&s;ures of this World, to eternize, if po&s;&s;ible,
their earthly Happine&s;s by a <PB N="352" REF="391"> Succe&s;&s;ion of
Variety, and to take off the Wearine&s;s of one Plea&s;ure by a|nother, between
the Oil and the Wine, as <HI>Seneca</HI> &s;peaks. <HI>Homines inter vinum
&amp; oleum occupati</HI>; but all in vain; for after tho&s;e few evaporated
Minutes of Plea&s;ure, the Body quietly fails the Mind, and the Mind the
De&s;ire, and the De&s;ire the Satisfaction, and all the Man. There is indeed
nothing more in all the&s;e Plea&s;ures, be&s;ides bare Imagination and
Expectation, which tho' they may draw out the Affections, do never &s;a|tisfie
them, nay, do the more di&s;&s;ati&s;|fie and di&s;appoint them, and Plea&s;ure
is but an Earne&s;t laid down for Grief, if not for Ruin.</P>
<P>This Adventure hath no other Re|turn, and if this be a Man's End,
'tis an End that quickly ends both it &s;elf and him: Many have come to their
End by it, never any enjoy'd their End in it. <HI>Alexander</HI> was a greater
Conque|ror in overcoming his own De&s;ire of &s;eeing <HI>Darius</HI> his Wife
and Daughters, than in &s;ubduing them, <HI>Victor Magis Darii uxorem, non
videndo quam Da|rium vincendo.</HI></P>
<P>In the next Place, we &s;hall &s;ee &s;ome Men rake Riches together,
as Children <PB N="353" REF="392"> do Snow, rowling it up with no little Pains
and Hazards of their Health, in|to Heaps, and then fa&s;hioning them in|to
Hor&s;es, Giants and Ca&s;tles, and the next Shower wa&s;hes them away, and
leaves nothing in the Place but Dirt. It was well &s;aid of
<HI>Themi&s;tocles,</HI> that great General, to a common Soldier, <HI>Thou who
art not</HI> Themi&s;tocles, <HI>take this Tra&s;h to thee,</HI> meaning the
Jewels and the rich <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Spoils after a Victory. Wealth certainly
is one of the greate&s;t Bankrupts in the World, and does not &s;atisfie the
Debt it promi&s;es; for a Man may as &s;oon fill a Quart Pot with Vir|tue, as a
rational Mind with Wealth; there mu&s;t be a Proportion between the Ingredient
and the Capacity. We call that Well, or Brain, empty, that hath not Water or
Wit; tho' the fir&s;t be full of Air, the other of Vapour, they are &s;till
empty of what &s;hould fill them, and &s;o will the Heart of Man be, tho' never
&s;o full of Wealth, and much of it doth but let us &s;ee, how much more of it
we want. The World is not &s;o unequally dealt, as we talk, the Rich want a
Stomach oftner than the Poor do Meat: If the Poor Man's Hunger and Labour be
more, his Meat and Sleep are &s;weeter, and what Hap|pine&s;&s;es 
<PB N="354" REF="393"> are the&s;e, that are as well not received as enjoyed,
as well wanted as had; the Will would certainly never be &s;atisfy'd, if it had
all it de&s;ired, but one is pre&s;ently &s;atisfy'd if he renounces it; in
complying with the Will we &s;hall never be at quiet, not complying with it, we
&s;hall always be at re&s;t. <HI>Solo|mon</HI> and <HI>Job</HI> have be&s;t
known the Happine&s;s and Mi&s;ery of Man, and have the be&s;t de&s;cribed it,
one of them the happie&s;t, and the other the mo&s;t wretched of Men; the one
knew the Vanity of all Plea&s;ure, the other the Reality of all Evils, by
Experience.</P>
<P>Plea&s;ure, in&s;tead of &s;atisfying, doth &s;atiate, but Riches
doth neither. For my own Part, my Humour does not much depend upon the&s;e
Things. I have always fair and &s;oul Weather with|in my &s;elf, good or ill
Succe&s;s in my Affairs does not much move me, I &s;ometimes &s;et my &s;elf
again&s;t ill For|tune, and the Glory of overcoming it makes me ma&s;ter it
with Plea&s;ure; whereas at other Times I am very in|different, and as it were
di&s;&s;atisfy'd, e|ven with Pro&s;perity, looking upon Worldly Glory but as a
Fancy: If we fi&s;h for it, we &s;hall find it nothing, an Apparition, like the
Night Mare in a <PB N="355" REF="394"> Dream, you imagine it a Sub&s;tance, you
gra&s;p at it, you awake and it is nothing. Plea&s;ure yet and Wealth will
abide a Sen&s;e or two; but this of Glory can neither be felt, &s;een or
under&s;tood; be|&s;ides the Slipperine&s;s of it &s;hould make us undervalue
it. (Let us remember the Con&s;ul <HI>Bibulus</HI> in his triumphant Chariot by
the Fall of a Tile-Stone from a Hou&s;e made a Sacrifice, before he could reach
the Capitol, to offer up the Bulls and Garlands he had prepared; or in that

Puni&s;hment of human Cares before they have de&s;erv'd them; let harmle&s;s
Wantonne&s;s be freely allow'd <PB N="360" REF="399"> them, and let them rather
fear, than feel the Correction of their Parents. To Colts and young Cattle we
freely allow an uncontrolled Freedom, lea&s;t their fir&s;t Strength (which is
then grow|ing) &s;hould be hindred; and yet we are &s;o blind in what we behold
in other Creatures, we either neglect, or will not under&s;tand in our own
Children, who after they have fulfill'd the Folly of their fir&s;t Years, Age
does by little and little change their De&s;ires, and the Roots of Virtue will
&s;pring up in them; and therefore &s;uch as will call the raw Minds of
Children to too ha&s;ty a Ripe|ne&s;s of Studies, are very Ignorant of the
Strength which Nature be&s;tow'd on that Age: Some Children indeed have early
Wits; as <HI>Papyrius</HI>'s Childhood that was judged worthy of the
<HI>Roman</HI> Senate. The Humours of Children are very va|rious; &s;ome &s;eem
to be made of a bet|ter Mould than others. There are often &s;een Pre&s;ages of
future Abilities in Chil|dren; as in <HI>Cyrus,</HI> who fir&s;t founded the
<HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Monarchy, who was bred up and believed to be a Shepherd's
Child, till after a more &s;trict Inquiry, he was found to be the Grand-child
of <HI>A&s;tyages</HI>; and <HI>Cato,</HI> in his Infancy, was more than a
Child; but this is very uncertain, and <PB N="361" REF="400"> they are often
deceiv'd, who by the Be|haviour of Children will judge too ha|&s;tily of their
future Di&s;po&s;ition; for it mu&s;t be &s;ome great &s;ign and firmly
con|&s;tant above the Levity of that Age, which mu&s;t be brought as an
effectual Argu|ment to judge of the Inclination of their future and flexible
Years. Tho' &s;ome Children are more governable, and ea|&s;ier gain'd by gentle
U&s;age, yet their Manners are generally according to their Education; the
neglect of Di&s;cipline, and the force of Example, makes the Difference, and
cau&s;es Children to &s;uc|ceed or mi&s;carry; but tho&s;e who are naturally
mo&s;t inclin'd to Ill are in mo&s;t Danger; and &s;ince Education is the chief
Rea&s;on of their fir&s;t Principles, great Care mu&s;t be taken to &s;et the
Bya&s;s right at fir&s;t, and that Virtue may be early in|&s;till'd into their
Minds, which will make their Lives happy for the future, and then Cu&s;tom will
make it ea&s;ie to them: And indeed, Children &s;hould be treated with great
Warine&s;s; they &s;hould hear and &s;ee nothing that &s;hould be dangerous in
the Imitation, and the Indi&s;cretion of Parents is very often of ill
Con&s;equence in this Particular; which puts me in mind of what
<HI>Montaign</HI> &s;ays to this Purpo&s;e; who being pre&s;ent whil&s;t the
Governante <PB N="362" REF="401"> was hearing his Daughter read, and there
being an ob&s;cene Word, &s;he for|bad her the naming it; whereupon the Father
was very angry with the Gover|nante, and &s;aid, <HI>She had done his Daugh|ter
much hurt in taking Notice of that Word, which &s;he &s;hould have let pa&s;s
without any Ob&s;ervation.</HI></P>
<P>Childhood is certainly the principal Time for Improvement, whil&s;t
the Mind is at liberty, the Memory &s;trong, Plea|&s;ures unknown to them; and
they are like white Paper, where you may Write what you plea&s;e; and we
&s;hould never de&s;ign Children to any Profe&s;&s;ion before their Capacities
are known, and their Genius and Inclinations examin'd; for otherwi&s;e their
Nature may be cro&s;&s;ed, and to &s;trive again&s;t the Stream is alto|gether
in vain; and if Care were taken that the Inclinations of young Peo|ple were
&s;uited to their Profe&s;&s;ions, we &s;hould &s;ee them improve much fa&s;ter
than they do; for Men mu&s;t not endea|vour to fly without Wings, and to
un|dertake Bu&s;ine&s;s that is too hard for them: The Pa&s;&s;ions of young
Men often carry them with full Speed, when they want the Bridle and not the
Spur; and like a Ship without a Pilot, they often over-&s;et them&s;elves,
being launched with|out <PB N="363" REF="402"> Balla&s;t, and wanting a
Compa&s;s to Steer by, they are &s;oon under Water: And indeed, Youth without
good Breed|ing is in a dangerous Condition, and &s;oon lo&s;t, being &s;ubject
to great Ra&s;h|ne&s;s; and therefore tho&s;e that are Young &s;hould be very
careful of their Carriage, &s;ince we &s;ee oftentimes tho&s;e that are very
promi&s;ing in their Youth, flag at the la&s;t, and fall &s;hort of
Expectation.</P>
<P>Young Men, at their fir&s;t Entrance into Man's E&s;tate, the Heat
of Blood breeds in them a wonderful Change, carries away their Mind with a Tide
of incon&s;iderate Confidence and vain Se|curity, they know not how to be
Pro|vident for After-times, neither can they con&s;ider how obnoxious they are
to the Ruins of Fortune.</P>
<P>The Office of Childhood is to Learn, and retain by a &s;trong
Memory, the Deeds and Speeches of their Ance&s;tors; of Youth, to invent and
&s;peak Things altogether new; of middle Age, to mo|derate it &s;elf by
Ob&s;ervation from both the former, for then our Bodies and Minds are
exceedingly changed from what they were heretofore; and as we grow in Years,
our Plea&s;ures and Incli|nations are not the &s;ame, even our Man|ners, and
all our De&s;ires, are much dif|ferent, <PB N="364" REF="403"> and moulded as
it were a-new. No Age of Man is more cunning than the middle Age, in
di&s;&s;embling Friend|&s;hip, and governing their Affections. It can then
wonder at it &s;elf, that it could &s;o improvidently go a&s;tray, and
endea|vours to repair the Ruins of his younger Years, and renews with much
Vigour the Errors of the &s;ame. Memory is e|ver greate&s;t in Children, being
then able to retain what they learn, and &s;till &s;afely &s;tore it up in the
Clo&s;ets of their Memory; but as Age increa&s;es it will decay, and therefore
their Minds ought to be fill'd with profitable Hi&s;tory whil&s;t they are
young; for Memory is like the Dew, which in hot Countries falls up|on the
Leaves of Holly, unle&s;s it be ga|ther'd by break of Day, it vani&s;hes at Sun
Ri&s;ing. Things of little Labour and no Judgement, will ea&s;ily be at|tain'd
by Children, who are neither &s;trong for Labour, nor ripe for Judg|ment.</P>
<P>Publick Mini&s;ters, when they have a Mind to prolong their Families
in Ho|nour, &s;hould always breed at lea&s;t one of their Children in their
Office under them. This the <HI>French</HI> do con&s;tantly practi&s;e, which

<P>The <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> have that whole&s;ome Piece of Policy, that

him all the My&s;tery of it; and this general Cu&s;tom, or Law, keeps their
Heads from running at random after Book Learning and other Vocations. The
extravagant Cu&s;tom of <HI>England</HI> herein is not to be commended, where
all Men a&s;pire to Book Learning; when there is not a &s;impler Animal, and a
more &s;uperfluous Member of a State, than meer Scholar <HI>telluris inutile

Books &s;hou'd &s;till keep them &s;oft and &s;imple to warlike Affairs. It is
re|ported, that <HI>Gro&s;thead,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Lin|coln,</HI> had a
Brother a Husbandman, who &s;eeing his Brother come to that great Station, came
to him in Expecta|tion of &s;ome great Preferment, or &s;ome|thing very
con&s;iderable; but the Bi&s;hop told him, that if he wanted Mony to mend his
Plow or Cart, or to buy a new one; of if he wanted Tackling for his Hor&s;es,
or any other Things belonging to his Husbandry, he &s;hou'd not want what was
fitting, but he wi&s;hed him to aim no higher, for Husbandman he found him, and
a Husbandman he would leave him; and to &s;hew the Force of Educa|tion, and
that the learned&s;t Men are not always the wi&s;e&s;t, there goes a fa|mous
Story of <HI>Thomas Aquinas,</HI> and Saint <HI>Bonaventure,</HI> being both
invited to Dinner by the <HI>French</HI> King, on pur|po&s;e to ob&s;erve their
Humours, being brought into the Room where the Ta|ble was cover'd and made
ready, the fir&s;t fell to eating of Bread as fa&s;t as he could, and at la&s;t
breaking out of a brown Stu|dy, he cry'd out <HI>Concafum e&s;t contra
Manichaeos</HI>: The other fell gazing up|on the Queen, and the King asking 
<PB N="367" REF="406"> him how he lik'd her, <HI>Oh Sir,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>if
an earthly Queen be &s;o beautiful, what &s;hall we think of the Queen of
Heaven.</HI> This latter was e&s;teem'd the better Courtier. But from hence we
may infer, That the learned&s;t Men are not always the civille&s;t and be&s;t
moral Men. And there is too great a Number of them, who lead a &s;oft
&s;edentary Life, feeding only their own Fancies upon the Publick, and
therefore it were to be wi&s;hed, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had not &s;o
ge|neral an itching after Book Learning</P>
<P>I well remember to have known a Per&s;on of Honour and great Quality

&s;ome Advantages of Old Age, of which I am at pre&s;ent a living Te&s;timony,
even in this Year 1706.</P>
<P>The Life of Man is u&s;ually divided into Childhood, Youth, Man's
E&s;tate, and Old Age, all which Degrees we bring into that narrow Compa&s;s,
whil&s;t our Life con&s;umes in&s;en&s;ibly. Infancy is only a State of Hope,
and mo&s;t com|monly &s;upported by the indulgent Ten|derne&s;s of Parents and
Nur&s;es. Youth, if well Educated, will &s;oon blo&s;&s;om, and after yield
Fruit. Man's E&s;tate, like a Flame, well kindled and &s;upply'd will burn
long, but Old Age does u&s;ually &s;oon pa&s;s away; and if we do not watch, we
lo&s;e our Opportunities; if we do not make ha&s;te we are left behind, our
be&s;t Hours fly from us, the wor&s;t are to come; the pure&s;t Part of our
Life runs fir&s;t, and leaves only the Dregs at the Bottom, unle&s;s we take
great Care, and then our Strength and De&s;ires will fall off together, and our
Years will &s;it ea&s;ie upon us, when we're thus &s;atisfy'd and compos'd; it
&s;mooths our Pa&s;&s;age <PB N="378" REF="417"> to the other World, and makes
us &s;lide into the Grave with a more gentle and in&s;en&s;ible Motion. Indeed
if we could ob&s;erve the State of our Infancy, when we came fir&s;t into the
World, with the Progre&s;s of our Growth, and the Be|ginning of our Rea&s;on,
it would certainly be a plea&s;ant Retro&s;pection, but divine Providence hath
hid this from our Sight. At our Birth neither our Limbs nor Under&s;tanding
were born at their full Growth, but we encrea&s;e by Degrees, and being Infants
in our Bodies, we are not Men in our Souls: The fir&s;t ten Years we may call
an Animal Life, the Powers of Rea&s;on are then feeble in us, and we do but
&s;leep that Time away, but afterwards the Advances of Age are very gradual;
but yet this Gradation is &s;o &s;low, that we cannot take much No|tice of it,
nor &s;ee it with our Eyes, and &s;o we think all goes well, &s;ince we are not
thrown &s;o &s;uddenly out of our Youth into our Manhood, and from that into
Old Age, which would be much more &s;en&s;ible to us, and concerns us more: But
we walk gently up Hill from our Youth to our middle State, and as gently down
the Hill from our Man|hood into Old Age, without perceiv|ing 
<PB N="379" REF="418"> the Change we have made 'till we come at the Bottom:
However we mu&s;t needs be troubled, when we con|&s;ider the greate&s;t Part of
Life is no bet|ter than a &s;low Con&s;umption, and that at la&s;t we mu&s;t
fall into a State of Weak|ne&s;s, and be unacceptable both to o|thers and to
our &s;elves: But we &s;el|dom think of this, becau&s;e we &s;eem to be the
&s;ame Men in the Morning, as we were the Night before. Now he that would have
his Health hold out to the la&s;t, and grow old with Advantage, mu&s;t be
regular in his Youth, and not live too fa&s;t: We mu&s;t husband our
Con&s;tituti|on, and not throw it away 'till we have done living, for our Vices
de&s;troy our Lives as well as our Fortunes; Intem|perance antidates our
Infirmities, and makes us die much &s;ooner than we &s;hould; and tho' we have
the World be|fore us, we do not play the good Hu&s;|band early enough; for 'tis
too late to &s;pare at the Bottom, when all is drawn out to the Lees. 'Tis
true, we old Men cannot but be &s;omething con|cerned, to think that we grow
le&s;s and le&s;s every Day, doing the &s;ame things over again; and that we
live only to nur&s;e up our Decays, which is trou|ble&s;ome 
<PB N="380" REF="419"> to us, e&s;pecially &s;ince there is nothing in this
World to make us in love with it, or fond of it; none yet were ever fully
pleas'd with it; for tho' it &s;eems a <HI>Juno</HI> in the Pur&s;uit, 'tis but
a Cloud in our Embraces; and there|fore tho&s;e who are &s;orry to &s;ee their
Voyage fixed, are over-fond of their native Country, and hang about Life a
little too meanly. Indeed when our Sen&s;es droop, and all the Faculties of our
Souls and Bodies decay apace, it is then high time to bid adieu to the active
Life, and not only to abandon the Vanities of this fading World, but the very
Remembrance and Thoughts of them: Our Minds begin then to be nau&s;eated with
the Ideas of our pa&s;t Folly, which we fal&s;ly call'd Plea&s;ure; and that
Retro&s;pect is unplea&s;ant, when we re|flect upon a Life to be repented of.
It is but Rea&s;on when we approach near the Grave, when all our Sen&s;es put
us daily in Mind of our Mortality, that we &s;hould begin to recollect our
&s;elves, and think whereabouts we are, that we may not be &s;urpriz'd, and die
le&s;s than our &s;elves. It &s;hould be our Care be|fore we grow old to live
well, and then we may be &s;ure to die well. It is the <PB N="381" REF="420">
Duty of Life to prepare our &s;elves for Death; there is not one Hour we live,
that does not mind us of our Mortality. Time runs on, the Period is certain,
tho' it lyes in the Dark, our Term is &s;et, and none of us know how near it
is, and therefore we &s;hould not won|der to have that befall us to Day, which
might have happened to us any Minute &s;ince we were born. This
Con|&s;ideration &s;hould make us live as if e|very Minute were our la&s;t. But
we fear Death, only becau&s;e we know not where we &s;hall go, and we never
begin to reform 'till our old Age, after ha|ving &s;pent our former Years in
all Sorts of Vanity (which is better late than never) but 'tis a mi&s;erable
Ca&s;e, not to know the Value of a Trea&s;ure, 'till we are going to lo&s;e it.
To begin our Frugality, when we are ready to turn Bankrupts: We &s;hould
therefore begin early to do that which will al|ways plea&s;e, and young Men
&s;hould carefully avoid throwing away their Time, as if they came into the
World for no other End but to eat and &s;leep, or el&s;e to &s;pend their Days
in Wan|tonne&s;s and Folly, and to make Vice <PB N="382" REF="421"> their
Bu&s;ine&s;s. Thus we &s;ee in gene|ral, that Age grows wor&s;e upon the
Pro|gre&s;s, and hath no Relief to expect but the Grave; yet in &s;ome, Health,
Vigour and Sen&s;e, hold out to the la&s;t. Many of the ancient Philo&s;ophers
and <HI>Romans</HI> were Examples of this Truth. <HI>Tully,</HI> who wrote
excellently well <HI>de Senectute</HI> was a lively Example hereof, being
pa&s;t Sixty when he wrote his <HI>Philippicks,</HI> in which his Rheto|rick is
more correct and moving than in his younger Orations. The Poe|tick Fire, which
is u&s;ually &s;oone&s;t ex|tinct in Men, I have found by Expe|rience in my
&s;elf, hath la&s;ted much beyond that Period, of which I could give modern
Proof, but I will leave that to my Son; only this I can with Truth affirm, that
the Poems I have made &s;ince my Age of Seventy, have more of Force and Spirit,
than tho&s;e I had written &s;ome Years before; but this is a particular Grace
of God, it being very unu&s;ual in the Generality, and ve|ry hard for Men to
&s;eem young when they're old, and much more &s;trange to be &s;o; for tho' at
ones Death, <HI>Fuimus</HI> may make a good Motto, yet in Life 'tis &s;tark
naught.</P>
<P><PB N="383" REF="422">None can imagine how green and vigorous &s;ome
Mens Minds are in Old Age, having a perpetual Conflict with their Bodies, who
were ill-match'd, unle&s;s to &s;hew that an active Spirit may be lodged in a
decay'd Body. It is certainly a particular Happine&s;s to pre&s;erve the Force
of the Mind in the Decay of the Body, to live to that Age, that neither cares
for any thing, nor &s;tands in need of any thing; that tho' it can much longer,
yet it will not &s;till do the &s;ame Things over again, which it ought not to
do, Age ha|ving put an End to his De&s;ires; cer|tainly there can be no gentler
End, than thus to melt away in a kind of Di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>Where Fire meets with Oppo&s;ition and Matter to work upon, it is
furi|ous and rages, but when it finds no Fuel, as in Old Age, it goes out
quick|ly for want of Nouri&s;hment; nor is the Body the &s;ettled Habitation of
the Soul, but a temporary Lodging, which we mu&s;t leave whenever the Ma&s;ter
of the Hou&s;e plea&s;es. 'Tis true, every Man hath naturally a Love for his
own Body, as poor People love even their own beggarly Cottages: They are 
<PB N="384" REF="423"> old Acquaintances, and loath to part; yet old Men, tho'
they may &s;ome|what indulge their Bodies, yet they make not them&s;elves
Slaves to them, nor care any more what becomes of their Carka&s;&s;es, when
dead, than a Man does for the &s;having of his Beard under the Hand of a
Barber. How|ever Age it &s;elf is not without its Plea&s;ures, if we knew
rightly how to u&s;e them (the be&s;t Mor&s;el being &s;till re&s;erved for the
la&s;t) or almo&s;t it is equivalent to the enjoying of Plea|&s;ures, not to
&s;tand in need of them. Time indeed goes fa&s;ter with old Men than young,
becau&s;e they rec|kon mo&s;t upon it. There is hardly any Man &s;o old but he
may hope for one Day more yet, and the longe&s;t Life is but a Multiplication
of Days, nay Hours and Moments, for the End of our Lives is &s;et, and the
fir&s;t Breath we draw, is but the fir&s;t Step to our la&s;t, the Cour&s;e of
all Things in this World being only a long Connection of Providential
Appointments; and tho' there be great Variety in our Lives, yet all tend to the
&s;ame I&s;|&s;ue. Death old Men find mo&s;t ea&s;ie, becau&s;e it is comply'd
with without <PB N="385" REF="424"> &s;trugling; for by dying of old Age, a Man
does no more than go to Bed when he is weary, it being childi&s;h to go out of
the World as we came into it, groan|ing and crying. For the&s;e and many other
Rea&s;ons, I cannot agree with them that &s;eem to impute much Inconveni|ence
to long Life, and that length of Days does much rather impair than im|prove us;
for if we follow the Cour&s;e of Nature and of Rea&s;on, old Age is a mighty
Ble&s;&s;ing, were it only in re|gard that it gives Time leave to vent and boil
away the Unquietne&s;s and Turbulency that follow our Pa&s;|&s;ions in our
younger Years, and weans us gently from carnal Affections, and at la&s;t to
drop with Ea&s;e and Willing|ne&s;s, like ripe Fruit from the Tree; for when
before the Sea&s;on Fruit is pull'd off with violent Hands, or &s;haken down by
rude and boi&s;terous Winds, it hath an indige&s;ted raw ta&s;te of the Wood,
and hath an unplea&s;ant Eagerne&s;s in its Juice, that makes it unfit for
U&s;e till length of time hath mellowed it; &s;o Souls that go out of their
Bodies with Affection to tho&s;e Objects they leave behind (which u&s;ually is
as long as they can reli&s;h them) do retain &s;till, as &s;ome 
<PB N="386" REF="425"> think, even to their Separation, a By|a&s;s and
Langui&s;hing toward them. Be|&s;ides, we mu&s;t con&s;ider that old Age is not
always a Burthen and Incum|brance, there are &s;everal peculiar Pri|vileges
annexed to this part of Life which will relieve us under the Decays of the
Body; for the Imperfections of old Age are not &s;o unavoidable as grey Hairs.
The quiet Compo&s;ure of an old Man's Mind, keeps him from wearing out &s;o
fa&s;t, it props up his Strength, and makes him live cheer|fully to the la&s;t
Moment; for ea&s;ie Thoughts are excellent Opiates, which will not only
mitigate old Men's Di|&s;temper, but make them almo&s;t to de&s;pi&s;e their
Mi&s;ery. Thus mo&s;t Men take Care to live long, but few take Care to live
well, which is in every Man's Power to do, but in no Man's Power to do the
former.</P>
<P>We con&s;ume our Lives in providing the very In&s;truments of Life,
&s;o that we do not properly live but we are about to live, and we only
propound to begin to live at our old Age, to which very few People arrive.</P>
<P>There are other very remarkable Advantages of old Age; for tho&s;e 
<PB N="387" REF="426"> who have had the longe&s;t Time to im|prove them&s;elves
mu&s;t needs be the wi&s;e&s;t Men; &s;uch have &s;een greater Va|riety of
Events, have had more Oppor|tunities of ob&s;erving Humours and In|tere&s;ts:
Their Judgments are more ex|act, they know more things and tho&s;e better than
young Men, bringing their Thoughts to a &s;econd Te&s;t, for trying what they
took upon Tru&s;t in their Youth. Old Men are u&s;ually free from violent
Pa&s;&s;ions; matters of Moment are better con&s;ider'd by them; whereas
younger Per&s;ons are apt to judge ami&s;s, their Pro&s;pect being too &s;hort;
and certainly Age is the time in which the Mind is mo&s;t di&s;cerning, and
furni&s;ht with the be&s;t Materials for Wi&s;dom: Tho&s;e who have been
longe&s;t in publick Employments, who&s;e Performances have been more than
ordi|nary, who have done mo&s;t Service for their King and Country, de&s;erve
cer|tainly a more particular Re&s;pect, and &s;hould be con&s;idered with more
Re|gards, and &s;hould have the faire&s;t Ac|knowledgments, and treated with
the be&s;t Civility, like parting Friends that are ready to take leave of the
World; but, alas! this &s;eldom happens, for old <PB N="388" REF="427">
Services are u&s;ually forgotten, e&s;peci|ally in an Age where young Men &s;ee
Vi&s;ions, and old Men Dream, their former Actions and repeated good Ser|vices
being no more taken notice of, than if they had never been, tho' even Decency
and Good-Nature &s;hould at lea&s;t make them be re&s;pected for them.</P>
<P>Thus the State of Mortals in this Life is very changeable; if we are
in|vited to ca&s;t Anchor awhile in &s;ome calm, &s;erene Sea&s;on, if we are
permit|ted to Careen and Recruit our Wea|ther-beaten Spirits, enjoying &s;ome
&s;hort interval of Re&s;t and Ea&s;e, the Indul|gence &s;oon expires, and we
are forced to hoi&s;t Sail with double Diligence, lea&s;t we &s;uffer a Wreck,
for we fly at Random in a Sea of perpetual Hazards and Difficulties; and yet
the &s;hortne&s;s of Life is the common Complaint of mo&s;t People, who make it
&s;hort either by doing ill, doing nothing, or doing Things be&s;ides their
Bu&s;ine&s;s; &s;o that this large extent of Life will not per|haps amount to
the Minority of Man; &s;o that it may be a long Being, perhaps a &s;hort Life;
for it is not the Num|ber of Years that makes Death ea&s;ie to 
<PB N="389" REF="428"> us, but the Temper of the Mind; he that would live a
little longer this Day, would be as loth to Die a thou&s;and Years hence: Go we
mu&s;t at la&s;t, no matter how &s;oon: 'Tis the Work of the Al|mighty to make
us live long, but 'tis own Bu&s;ine&s;s to make a &s;hort Life &s;uf|ficient.
Life is to be mea&s;ur'd by our Actions, not by Time. A Man may die old at
Thirty, and young at Eighty, the one lives after Death, the other pe|ri&s;hed
before he died. And therefore that Noble General <HI>Similis,</HI> who lived to
a great Age, and retired from Bu&s;i|ne&s;s to his Devotion Seven Years before
his Death, would have only this Epi|taph in Sub&s;tance engrav'd upon his
Tomb-&s;tone: <HI>Here lies</HI> Similis <HI>of a ve|ry great Age, and yet
lived only Seven Years.</HI></P>
<P>Old Age is the Effect of Providence: How long I &s;hall live is only
in God's Power, but it's in my Power how well. How great a &s;hame is it then
to be lay|ing new Foundations of Life at our la&s;t Ga&s;p? for an old Man,
with one Foot in the Grave, to go to School again? While we are young we may
learn, be|cau&s;e our Minds are then tractable, and our Bodies fit for Labour;
but <PB N="390" REF="429"> when old Age comes on, we are com|monly &s;eiz'd
with Sloath and afflicted with Di&s;ea&s;es, and at la&s;t we leave the World
as Ignorant as we came into it; only we die wor&s;e than we were born, which is
our own Fault. I wi&s;h with all my Soul that I had thought better and &s;ooner
of my End; but I mu&s;t now make the more ha&s;te, and being in good Health, I
mu&s;t Spur on, like tho&s;e that &s;et out late upon a Journey: It is better
to learn late, than not at all, altho' it be only to in&s;truct me how I may
leave the Stage of this World, with a perfect Re&s;ignation, with a true
Sen&s;e of the Sins of my fore-pa&s;&s;ed Life, with a true Fear of God, and a
&s;ure Tru&s;t in his Mercy; and thus I &s;hall &s;ink with Ea&s;e into my
Grave, and tho' I die old, I &s;hall ri&s;e young in the other World, for that
State is an eternal Spring, ever flouri&s;hing, and &s;hall gently pa&s;s from
one Extream to another.</P>
