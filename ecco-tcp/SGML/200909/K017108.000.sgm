<P>Who's the Dupe? A FARCE: As it is ACTED at the THEATRE-ROYAL IN

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE Reader will find Pa&s;&s;ages in the following Scenes, which
are not &s;poken on the Stage. Actors of &s;kill and ability, ac|quainted with
the ideas of the Writer, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by all the advantages of
Stage-repre|&s;entation, give impre&s;&s;ions of character and &s;ituation with
more expedition and certainty than can be done by Words alone; elucida|tions,
which may be nece&s;&s;ary for the Reader, are therefore very frequently and
properly omitted by them.</P>
<P>The Author owes too much to the very excellent manner in which the
Farce is acted, not to &s;eize this opportunity of acknow|ledging her
obligations to the Performers.</P>
<P>Judging from her own experience, as well as her ob&s;ervation on
that of others, &s;he feels that Authors are &s;o far from having rea&s;on to
join in the common clamour on the declen&s;ion <PB N="4" REF="3"> of the Stage,
that there has been no period in which performances in the Comic line have been
repre&s;ented with &s;uch uniform &s;trength: and though it is impo&s;&s;ible
for her to form di&s;tinctions on the merit of &s;o perfect a
repre|&s;entation, yet &s;he cannot omit expre&s;&s;ing her particular
obligations to Mr. King, for accept|ing, from the be&s;t motives, and in the
mo&s;t polite and candid manner, a part not perfectly agreeable to him&s;elf,
but which owes its effect principally to his performance.</P>
