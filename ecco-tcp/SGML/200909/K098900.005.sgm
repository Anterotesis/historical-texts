<P>THE following Papers were publi&s;h'd, and &s;e|veral of 'em written, by a Gentleman now Abroad. Many of 'em came from the &s;ame Hands which contributed to the other Volumes, &s;everal of which (I fancy) will ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves to have been the Pro|ductions of a Gentleman lately dead; one who, to the Advan|tages of a large E&s;tate and good Education, had acquir'd Learn|ing and an exact Knowledge of the be&s;t Sort of Men both at
<PB REF="3">
Home and Abroad; and with|al, was Ma&s;ter of &s;o much Wit and Humour, that there are few People who&s;e Conver&s;ations could be more de&s;irable. His Friends and the Publick equal|ly regret his Lo&s;s, &s;ince he was &s;erviceable and agreeable to 'em both in a very eminent De|gree. The re&s;t of the&s;e Papers are to live upon what Commen|dations they can give them|&s;elves, and perhaps may be thought not altogether unwor|thy of the Honour of &s;erving as a Supplement to the former Volumes.</P>

<P>'TIS impo&s;&s;ible perhaps for the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t among&s;t us, to keep &s;o con&s;tant a Guard upon our Temper, but that we may at one Time or other lie open to the Strokes of Fortune, and &s;uch Incidents as we cannot fore&s;ee. With Sentiments of this Kind I came Home to my Lodgings la&s;t Night, much fatigued with a long and &s;udden Journey from the Country, and full of the ungrateful Occa|&s;ion of it. 'Twas natural for me to have im|mediate Recour&s;e to my Pen and Ink; but be|fore I would offer to make U&s;e of them, I re|&s;olv'd deliberately to tell over a Hundred, and when I came to the End of that Sum, I found it more advi&s;able to defer drawing up my in|tended Remon&s;trance, till I had &s;lept &s;oundly on my Re&s;entments. Without any other Pre|face
<PB N="2" REF="5">
than this, I &s;hall give the World a fair Account of the Treatment I have lately met with, and leave them to judge, whether the Unea&s;ine&s;s I have &s;uffer'd be incon&s;i&s;tent with the Character I have generally pretended to. About Three Weeks &s;ince, I receiv'd an Invita|tion from a Kin&s;man in <HI>Stafford&s;hire,</HI> to &s;pend my <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> in tho&s;e Parts. Upon taking Leave of Mr. <HI>Morphew,</HI> I put as many Papers into his Hands as would &s;erve till my Return and charg'd him at parting, to be very punctual with the Town. In what Manner he and Mr. <HI>Lillie</HI> have been tamper'd with &s;ince, I can|not &s;ay, they have given me my Revenge, if I de&s;ired any, by allowing their Names to an idle Paper, that in all humane Probability, cannot live a Fortnight to an End. My &s;elf, and the Family I was with, were in the Mid&s;t of Gaie|ty, and a plentiful Entertainment, when I re|ceiv'd a Letter from my Si&s;ter <HI>Jenny,</HI> who, af|ter mentioning &s;ome little Affairs I had intru|&s;ted to her, goes on thus: <Q REND="inline">"The inclos'd, I be|lieve, will give you &s;ome Surprize, as it has al|ready a&s;toni&s;h'd every Body here: Who Mr. <HI>Steele</HI> is, that &s;ub&s;cribes it, I don't know, any more than I can comprehend what could induce him to it. <HI>Morphew</HI> and <HI>Lillie,</HI> I am told, are both in the Secret. I &s;hall not pre&s;ume to in&s;truct you, but hope you will u&s;e &s;ome Means to di&s;|appoint the ill Nature of tho&s;e who are taking Pains to deprive the World of one of its mo&s;t rea&s;onable Entertainments.

<P>I am to thank my Si&s;ter for her Compli+ment; but be that as it will, I &s;hall not ea&s;ily be di&s;courag'd from my former Undertaking<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> In Pur&s;uance of it, I was obliged upon this Notice to take Places in the Coach for my &s;elf and my Maid with the utmo&s;t Expedition, le&s;t I &s;hould, in a &s;hort Time, be rallied out of my Exi&s;tence, as &s;ome People will needs fancy

Mr. <HI>Partridge</HI> has been, and the real <HI>I&s;aac Bic|ker&s;taff</HI> have pa&s;&s;ed for a Creature of Mr. <HI>Steele</HI>'s Imagination. This Illu&s;ion might have hoped for &s;ome tolerable Succe&s;s, if I had not more than once produced my Per&s;on in a crowded Theatre; and &s;uch a Per&s;on as Mr. <HI>Steele,</HI> if I am not mi&s;informed in the Gentleman, would hardly think it an Advantage to own, though I &s;hould throw him in all the little Honour I have gained by my <HI>Lucubrations.</HI> I may be al|lowed, perhaps, to under&s;tand Plea&s;antry as well as other Men, and can (in the u&s;ual Phra&s;e) take a Je&s;t without being angry; but I appeal to the World, whether the Gentleman has not carried it too far, and whether he ought not to make a publick Recantation, if the Cre|dulity of &s;ome unthinking People &s;hould force me to in&s;i&s;t upon it. The following Letter is ju&s;t come to Hand, and I think it not improper to be in&s;erted in this Paper.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am extreamly glad to hear you are come to Town, for in your Ab&s;ence we were all mightily &s;urprized with an unaccountable Pa|per, Sign'd, <HI>Richard Steele,</HI> who is e&s;teem'd by tho&s;e that know him, to be a Man of Wit and Honour; and therefore we took it either to be a Counter&s;eit, or a perfect <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> Frolick of that ingenious Gentleman. But then, your Paper cea&s;ing immediately after; we were at a Lo&s;s what to think: If you were weary of the Work you had &s;o long carried on, and had given this Mr. <HI>Steele</HI> Orders to &s;ig|nify &s;o to the Publick, he &s;hould have &s;aid it in plain Terms; but as that Paper is worded, one would be apt to judge, that he had a Mind to per&s;wade the Town that there was &s;ome Analogy between <HI>I&s;aac Bicker&s;taff</HI> and him-Po&s;&s;ibly

Po&s;&s;ibly there may be a Secret in this which I cannot enter into; but I flatter my &s;elf that you never had any Thoughts of giving over your Labours for the Benefit of Mankind, when you cannot but know how many Subjects are yet unexhau&s;ted, and how many others, as being le&s;s obvious, are wholly untouch'd. I dare promi&s;e, not only for my &s;elf, but many other abler Friends, that we &s;hall &s;till continue to furni&s;h you with Hints on all proper Occa|&s;ions, which is all your Genius requires. I think, by the Way, you cannot in Honour have any more to do with <HI>Morphew</HI> and <HI>Lillie,</HI> who have gone beyond the ordinary Pitch of A&s;&s;u|rance, and tran&s;gre&s;s'd the very Letter of the Proverb, by endeavouring to cheat you of your Chri&s;tian and Sirname too.

<P>I Remember <HI>Menage</HI> tells a Story of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Racan,</HI> who had appointed a Day and Hour to meet a certain Lady of great Wit whom he had never &s;een, in order to make an Acquaintance between them. <Q REND="inline">'Two of <HI>Racan</HI>'s Friends, who had heard of the Appointment re&s;olved to play him a Trick. The fir&s;t went to the Lady two Hours before the Time, &s;aid his Name was <HI>Racan,</HI> and talk'd with her an Hour; they were both mightily plea&s;ed, began a great Friend&s;hip, and parted with much Satisfaction. A few Minutes after comes the Second, and &s;ends up the &s;ame Name; the Lady wonders at the Meaning, and tells him, Mr. <HI>Racan</HI> had ju&s;t left her. The Gentleman &s;ays it was &s;ome ra&s;|cally Impo&s;tor, and that he had been frequent|ly us'd in that Manner. The Lady is convinc'd, and they laugh at the Oddne&s;s of the Adven|tures. She now calls to Mind &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages which confirms her that the former was a Cheat. He appoints a Second Meeting, and takes his Leave. He was no &s;ooner gone, but the true <HI>Racan</HI> comes to the Door, and de&s;ires, under that Name, to &s;ee the Lady. She was
<PB N="6" REF="9">
out of all Patience, &s;ends for him up, rates him for an Impo&s;tor, and, after a Thou&s;and Inju|ries, flings a Slipper at his Head. It was im|po&s;&s;ible to pacify or di&s;abu&s;e her; he was for|ced to retire, and it was not without &s;ome Time, and the Intervention of Friends, that they could come to an Eclairci&s;ement."</Q> This, as I take it, is exactly the Ca&s;e with Mr. <HI>S&mdash;le,</HI> the pretended TATLER from <HI>Morphew,</HI> and my &s;elf, only (I pre&s;ume) the World will be &s;ooner undeceiv'd than the Lady in <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">nage.</HI> The very Day my la&s;t Paper came out, my Printer brought me another of the &s;ame Date, call'd the TAT|LER, by <HI>I&s;aac Bicker&s;taff</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and, which was &s;till more plea&s;ant, with an Adverti&s;ement at the End, calling me the <HI>Female</HI> TATLER: It is not enough to rob me of my Name, but now they mu&s;t impo&s;e a Sex on me, when my Years have long &s;ince determin'd me to be of none at all. There is only one Thing wanting in the Opera|tion, that they would renew my Age, and then I will heartily forgive them all the re&s;t. In the mean Time, whatever Unea&s;ine&s;s I have &s;uffer'd from the little Malice of the&s;e Men, and my Re|tirement in the Country, the Plea&s;ures I have re|ceiv'd from the &s;ame Occa&s;ion, will fairly bal|lance the Account. On the one Hand I have been highly delighted to &s;ee my Name and Character a&s;&s;umed by the Scribblers of the Age, in order to recommend them&s;elves to it; and on the other, to ob&s;erve the good Ta&s;te of the Town, in di|&s;tingui&s;hing and exploding them through every Di&s;gui&s;e, and &s;acrificing their Trifles to the &s;up|po&s;ed <HI>Manes</HI> of <HI>I&s;aac Bicker&s;taff</HI> E&s;quire. But the greate&s;t Merit of my Journey into <HI>Stafford&s;hire,</HI> is, that it has open'd to me a new Fund of unre|prov'd Follies and Errors that have hitherto lain out of my View, and, by their Situation, e&s;cap'd my Cen&s;ure. For, as I have liv'd generally in Town, the Images I had of the Country were
<PB N="7" REF="10">
&s;uch only as my Sen&s;es receiv'd very early, and my Memory has &s;ince pre&s;erv'd with all the Ad|vantages they fir&s;t appear'd in.</P>
<P>Hence it was that I thought our Pari&s;h-Church the noble&s;t Structure in <HI>England,</HI> and the 'Squire's Place-Hou&s;e, as we call'd it, a mo&s;t magnificent Palace. I had the &s;ame Opinion of the Alms-Hou&s;e in the Church-yard, and of a Bridge over the Brook that parts our Pari&s;h from the next. 'Twas the common Vogue of our School, That the Ma&s;ter was the be&s;t Scholar in <HI>Europe,</HI> and the U&s;her the Second. Not happening to correct the&s;e Notions by comparing them with what I &s;aw when I came into the World, upon return|ing back, I began to re&s;ume my former Imagi|nations, and expected all Things &s;hould appear in the &s;ame View as I left them when I was a Boy: But to my utter Di&s;appointment I found them wonderfully &s;hrunk, and le&s;&s;en'd almo&s;t out of my Knowledge. I look'd with Contempt on the Tribes painted on the Church Walls, which I once &s;o much admired, and on the carv'd Chimney-Piece in the 'Squire's Hall. I found my old Ma&s;ter to be a poor ignorant Pedant; and, in &s;hort, the whole Scene to be extreamly chang'd for the wor&s;e. This I could not help mention|ing, becau&s;e though it be of no Con&s;equence in it &s;elf, yet 'tis certain, that mo&s;t Prejudices are contracted and retained by this narrow Way of Thinking, which in Matters of the greate&s;t Mo|ment are hardly &s;hook off; and which we only think true, becau&s;e we were made to believe &s;o, before we were capable to di&s;tingui&s;h between Truth and Fal&s;hood. But there was one Prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion which I confe&s;s to have parted with, much to my Regret: I mean the Opinion of that na|tive Hone&s;ty and Simplicity of Manners which I had always imagin'd to be inherent in Country People. I &s;oon ob&s;erv'd it was with them and us, as they &s;ay of Animals; That every Species
<PB N="8" REF="11">
at Land, has one to re&s;emble it at Sea; for 'twas ea&s;y to di&s;cover the Seeds and Principles of every Vice and Folly that one meets with in the more known World, though &s;hooting up in different Forms. I took a Fancy out of the &s;everal Inha|bitants round, to furni&s;h the Camp; the Bar, and the Exchange, and &s;ome certain Chocolate and Coffee-hou&s;es, with exact Parallels to what, in many In&s;tances, they already produce. There was a drunken quarrel&s;ome <HI>Smith,</HI> whom I have a hundred Times fancied at the Head of a Troop of Dragoons. A Weaver, within two Doors of my Kin&s;man, was perpetually &s;etting Neighbours together by the Ears. I lamented to &s;ee how his Talents were mi&s;plac'd, and imagin'd what a Fi|gure he might make in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall.</HI> Good|man <HI>Crop</HI> of <HI>Compton-Farm,</HI> wants nothing but a Plumb and a Gold-Chain to qualify him for the Government of the City. My Kin&s;man's Stable-Boy was a gibbing Companion that would always have his Je&s;t. He would often put Cow-itch in the Maids Bed, pull Stools from under Folks, and lay a Coal upon their Shoes when they were a|&s;leep. He was at la&s;t turn'd off for &s;ome notable Piece of Roguery, and when I came away, was loitering among the Ale-hou&s;es. Ble&s;s me, thought I, what a prodigious Wit would this have been with us! I could have match'd all the Sharpers between St. <HI>James</HI>'s and <HI>Covent-Garden,</HI> with a notable Fellow in the &s;ame Neighbour|hood, (&s;ince hang'd for picking Pockets at Fairs) could he have had the Advantages of their Edu|cation. So nearly are the Corruptions of the Country ally'd to tho&s;e of the Town, with no further Difference than what is made by another Turn of Thought and Method of Living.</P>
<P>Many more Grievances, though not of equal Importance, have been laid before me from &s;eve|ral Parts of this Kingdom, which, as they fall not under any ones Cognizance &s;o properly as
<PB N="9" REF="12">
my own, oblige me to a &s;peedy and effectual Re|gulation of them. When I was prevail'd upon to, act as Cen&s;or of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> I did not enough, con&s;ider the Extent of that Province, nor how, difficult it would be to make my Authority un|der&s;tood in the remoter Parts of this I&s;land; for mo&s;t of the Natives being Strangers to Litera|ture, I cannot hope my Lucubrations &s;hould meet with a general Reception among&s;t them; and therefore I have now re&s;olved on an Expe|dient, which I &s;hall explain by the following Or|der.</P>

<P>WHen I left the Town, as I &s;aid before, I did not only make a &s;ufficient Provi&s;ion for the Continuance of my Lucubrations, till the Time I had fix'd for my Return, but took Care to &s;ub&s;titute one, who in ca&s;e my Stay &s;hould happen to be longer than I de&s;ign'd, would much better have furni&s;hed out the u&s;ual Entertain|ment the Publick expected from me. <HI>Sam Tru&s;ty,</HI> of whom I made Mention in a former Paper, was the Per&s;on I pitched upon to execute that Of|fice. Fifty Years and upwards we have liv'd in &s;o &s;trict an Intimacy, in &s;o perfect an Union, that neither Times, Intere&s;t, Pa&s;&s;ions nor Opinions, have ever been able to make the lea&s;t Flaw in our Friend&s;hip. I am not a&s;hamed to own I have received more Advantage from his Conver|&s;ation, than from all the Academick Exerci&s;es; 'tis to his In&s;tructions I owe the Improvement of my Under&s;tanding, to his Precepts and Example the forming of my Manners; and to his Ob&s;er|vations, the principal Remarks I have made up|on the &s;everal States and Conditions of Mankind. As his Genius at our fir&s;t &s;etting out in the World, was much above mine, &s;o he has ever &s;ince maintained the &s;ame Superiority. His Words were always few, his Arguments weighty, his Reflections ju&s;t, his Intentions &s;incere, and his Connexions were mixed with &s;uch an agreeable Mirth, that I have often taken Plea&s;ure in put|ting my &s;elf in the Wrong, on purpo&s;e to excite him to &s;o delightful a Reproof. A' &s;udden Indi&s;|po&s;ition
<PB N="12" REF="15">
defeated me of his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and has expo&s;ed me to the Difficulties I have been under in rein&s;tating my &s;elf in my former Authority.

I was unwilling the World &s;hould be deprived of one Line of his Writing, and con&s;equently could not well omit what the Exce&s;s of his Affection prompted him to &s;ay in my Favour, and which is perhaps the only In&s;tance that can be given of his Partia|lity.</P>

to declaim upon the Vices of the Age they live in; but I am far from believing we are half &s;o wicked as we &s;ay we are; and being a pretty &s;trict Enquirer into Humane Nature, and endea|vouring to trace all Things up to their original Cau&s;es, I am fully per&s;waded, that a malignant Love of Detraction is the reigning Vice of our Times; and could we but eradicate the perni|cious Practice of Railing and Defamation, we &s;hould appear to be much upon the Level with our Predece&s;&s;ors, and not wor&s;e than the Na|tions round about us. <HI>Zeno,</HI> the Founder of the Stoick Philo&s;ophy, had &s;o little Indulgence for the Frailties and Infirmities of Mankind, that he e&s;teemed the minute&s;t Deviation from the Rules of Rea&s;on and Ju&s;tice, to be of equal Weight with the mo&s;t horrid Crimes, and gro&s;|&s;e&s;t Impieties; &s;o &s;tealing an Apple, by his Ac|count, was as great a Sin as committing Sacri|lege; and the throwing at Cocks on <HI>Shrove-Tue&s;day</HI> would have been reckoned as heinous an Offence, as murthering ones Father in cold Blood.

<P><HI>Jenny Filch</HI> is a lamentable In&s;tance of this barbarous Cu&s;tom.

Her Lady|&s;hip &s;troaking the downy Honours of her Chin, with a hoar&s;e ma&s;culine Voice, pronounced her guilty of Incontinency, cheating at Play, Theft, and drinking to Exce&s;s: What an Accumula|tion of Enormities! How &s;evere are the&s;e Re|flections upon the Reputation of a young Lady?
<PB N="14" REF="17">
And had &s;he not a Greatne&s;s of Mind &s;uperior to their Malice, which &s;ome no doubt will a|&s;cribe to Impudence, I cannot &s;ee how &s;he could dare &s;hew her Face. But I who have known her from her Infancy, think it incumbent on me to vindicate her Character, and make no Que&s;tion, in very few Words, of convincing all impartial Judges, how innocent &s;he is of what they lay to her Charge. <HI>Jenny Filch</HI> was brought up at a Boarding-School, where Chil|dren of both Sexes were promi&s;cuou&s;ly receiv'd. From a Girl &s;he hated a Sedentary Life; &s;o little Progre&s;s was made in the Sampler. Her Humour was brisk and jovial, her Con&s;titution &s;anguine and vigorous, which led her to delight in robu&s;t Diver&s;ions; &s;uch as Trap-ball, Jug|gle-cat, Briti&s;h-hoppers, Nine-pins, and Whip|ping Tops. To &s;hare in their Sports, &s;he was fain to be much among the Boys; &s;he grew from thence to love their Company extreamly, and has gradually continued the Affection ever &s;ince. I am forced to explain this Matter very particularly, becau&s;e &s;he has been often twitted by the Ladies for liking to be with the Fellows rather than with them. As &s;he is a very little Ob&s;erver of Forms, &s;he &s;eldom could endure to be under the Re&s;traint of a &s;et Dre&s;s, but rather chu&s;e, with &s;ome one Friend, to go in a Mob, and a Mask, into the Pit at a Play, than to &s;it in a Box. The Vivacity of her Wit, and the Smart|ne&s;s of her Repartees, drew con&s;tantly all the young Beaux about her. This Humour of hers it &s;eems took mightily; and &s;he would often prevail upon tho&s;e Ladies of her Acquain|tance, who&s;e Husbands were beyond Sea, pure|ly out of Compa&s;&s;ion, rather than to &s;it moping and melancholy at Home, to go along with her; and in &s;hort, did all &s;he could to procure them &s;uch Diver&s;ions, as might make them le&s;s &s;en|&s;ible of their 'Spou&s;e's Ab&s;ence. When the Play
<PB N="15" REF="18">
was near done, no Body was more nice in chu|&s;ing &s;ome of the mo&s;t civil and harmle&s;s Men to lead them to a Coach; and becau&s;e Hack|ney-Coachmen are often very rude and impo|&s;ing, they would now and then for Protection permit them to &s;tep in, and perhaps drive to <HI>Phillips</HI>'s, ju&s;t to refre&s;h their Spirits. Some|times, if they were very well a&s;&s;ured of the Gentlemen's Behaviour, they would in a Fro|lick venture to ear a Friga&s;ee at <HI>Pontacks,</HI> but never failed to be back by Twelve. I remem|ber there was a great Pother about Two or Three of her Companions, who at their Hu&s;|band's Return, were very near encrea&s;ing their Family. But how &s;he is to blame all this while, no Body can &s;ay 'twas her doing; let every one an&s;wer for their own Follies: And this is all I ever heard alledged again&s;t her upon the fir&s;t Article.</P>
<P>Now, as to cheating at Play, I &s;uppo&s;e, what mi&s;lead them into that Opinion, was her great Skill and Dexterity in all Tricks at Cards: For having very fine Fingers, &s;he took a great deal of Plea&s;ure in learning whatever the famous <HI>High German</HI> could teach her in that Art, wherein &s;he grew &s;o great a Proficient, that in a &s;hort Time &s;he out-did her Ma&s;ter. Twice or Thrice a Week (meerly for Amu&s;ement) &s;he would pa&s;s the Evening at <HI>Langteral<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">;</HI> and truly 'twas very entertaining for any Standers by to ob|&s;erve what a &s;uperior Genius &s;he had in hand|ling the Cards above the People &s;he play'd with. She would make nothing of &s;hewing Three Loo's in Five Deals, to the great Wonder and Surprize of all the Company. But as this was only done for Diver&s;ion, &s;he cho&s;e to play &s;o low, that &s;he &s;eldom carried off above Four or Five Pounds, ju&s;t to pay her Chair, and buy clean Gloves; what they mean by Theft, I can't imagine, unle&s;s 'twas &s;lipping now and then a

China Cup into her Pocket at an <HI>Indian Hou&s;e,</HI> to adorn her Cabinet. This, it &s;eems, is a here|ditary Piece of Furniture &s;he is very fond of; it came from <HI>Italy</HI> long ago, the In&s;ide is curiou&s;|ly painted, wherein are repre&s;ented the Loves of <HI>Endymion</HI> and the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, Cupid</HI> and <HI>P&s;yche, Ve|nus</HI> and <HI>Adonis,</HI> with &s;everal other fabulous Stories. She ever loved to have Things neat a|bout her, and only wanted &s;ome few Pieces of China to place upon the Top of this Cabinet, but being a notable Hou&s;ewife, &s;he could not endure to &s;quander away her Money upon &s;uch Baubles; &s;o when &s;he went with any of her Ac|quaintance to Shops that deal in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e Things, &s;he would pick up in one Place a Cup, in the next a Saucer, in a Third &s;omething of another Sort, either China or Japan, ju&s;t as it came to Hand, and by Degrees got as compleat a Col|lection together as any Body: In &s;hort, there ne|ver was a more agreeable Variety, for no Two Pieces were alike in the whole Parcel. 'Tis ten to one &s;ome &s;crupulous People will be apt to call this Pilfering; but let them con&s;ider, no Body ever more exactly ob&s;erved the Rules of Ju&s;tice, in all the Mea&s;ures &s;he took, to &s;upply her &s;elf with tho&s;e Conveniencies. Every Shop contributed but barely its Share, and the Bur|then being equally laid, (&s;o far from giving Oc|ca&s;ion of Complaint) the Lo&s;s was &s;carce felt by any Body; be&s;ides, &s;he made them ample A|mends by commending their Goods, and bring|ing them Cu&s;tom. I may add in her Behalf, that what &s;he did was meerly in Conformity of the Fa&s;hion: Every Lady's Cabinet was cover'd with China; &s;he could not well afford to buy it, What &s;hould &s;he do? It has been a receiv'd Saying, <HI>One had as good be out of the World, as out of the Fa&s;hion;</HI> from whence we may con|clude, tho&s;e Things are as nece&s;&s;ary as Meat and Drink; and no Body was ever accounted a Cri|minal

for taking as much as would &s;uffice Na|ture, let it be at who&s;e Expence it would. In|deed, had this been done in any b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">e View, for filthy Lucre, and to &s;ell again, I readily grant &s;he were to blame; but in her Ca&s;e 'tis no more than &s;tealing the Cu&s;tom of Wine for ones own Table, and we all know how commonly that's practi&s;ed by People of very tender Con|&s;ciences.</P></Q>
<P>What remains to be &s;poken of, is, <HI>Her immode|rate Love of Wine;</HI> nor will &s;he be le&s;s clear in this, than in all the re&s;t. <Q><HI>Jenny</HI> has a voluble Tongue, and loves to exerci&s;e it, that I cannot but own &s;he often talks her &s;elf into a Heat, and that cau&s;es Thir&s;t; &s;ometimes by an Ab|&s;ence of Mind, pretty incident to her, &s;he will call for Gla&s;s after Gla&s;s, without remembring, &s;he drank but the Minute before. Now, this may prove &s;he has a &s;hort Memory indeed; but how to infer the <HI>Love of Wine</HI> from hence, I cannot &s;ee. The Mi&s;take however is ea&s;y to be accounted for. The Negligence of her Dre&s;s, her flu&s;ter'd Complexion, her great Loquacity &s;ometimes, and her incoherent An&s;wers to o|thers, when her Thoughts are wandering, often concur to make her look as if &s;he were actually in Drink: But is this an equitable Way of Judg|ing?

<P>LEaning out of my Window this Morning, I ob&s;erv'd a Young Gentleman pa&s;s under it, who&s;e Face I was &s;ure to have &s;een, but could not pre&s;ently recollect his Name. The Oddne&s;s of his Figure help'd to di&s;gui&s;e him; for, though otherwi&s;e decent enough, he had a Napkin-Cap on his Head; and at the &s;ame Time, by the Neg|ligence of his Air, gave one to under&s;tand, that he thought him&s;elf dre&s;s'd for the whole Day. In this Manner he walk'd on to the End of our Lane, then turn'd &s;hort upon his Heel, and hurry'd back again with the utmo&s;t Precipitation. By this Time I had made a &s;hift to remember, that this was the &s;ame Young Gentleman whom I formerly made Mention of, in order to recommend a Play of his to the World. There was Merit enough in that Performance to make me a Well-wi&s;her to the Author, and as much Wit as might make him ca|pable of an odd Turn in his Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>I was &s;orry to &s;ee him thus expos'd, and bec|kon'd him up to me; he came in great Confu&s;ion, and without giving me Time to ask any Que|&s;tions, told me, <HI>he was particularly a&s;ham'd to be &s;een by a Man of my Character, in &s;o heedle&s;s a Way, that indeed he had come out in &s;ome ha&s;t, and forg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">t his Hat and Perriwig.</HI> By his aukward Man|ner of excu&s;ing him&s;elf, I &s;oon found the Cau&s;e of his Di&s;order; that it was purely Artificial, and
<PB N="19" REF="22">
lay rather in his Heart than his Head. 'Twas with great Indignation I heard his Apology, and had not I been &s;trongly prejudic'd in the young Man's behalf, I &s;hould hardly have afforded him the Fa|vour of a Rebuke. After &s;ome Enquiry, I found by him, that this Inadvertency had co&s;t him much Pains and Indu&s;try to acquire, and that by long U&s;e, it was now improv'd into a Habit.</P>
<P>He freely own'd, that this was a Method he had often took to di&s;tingui&s;h and recommend him&s;elf as a Wit, and that he had hitherto met with good Succe&s;s. I was a little pacify'd with the Frankne&s;s of this Confe&s;&s;ion, and encourag'd him to proceed in it.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'To tell you the Truth, Sir, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I was led into this Error ve|ry young, and the Occa&s;ion of it perhaps may give you Diver&s;ion.

I at la&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h'd a Reputation. When I came to the Univer&s;ity, I expected to be laugh'd out of my Fooleries; but in&s;tead of that, I was every Day more confirm'd in them.

I cannot help adding a Word or Two upon this Humour of &s;etting up for a Wit, by per&s;onating a different Conduct from others, in the Common Actions of Life. The rather, becau&s;e within the Compa&s;s of my own Ob&s;ervation, it has depriv'd the World of many u&s;eful Per&s;ons, and eclips'd many valuable Qualifications. It has certainly been the Misfortune of &s;everal Great Men, to have had &s;omething &s;ingular in their Gate, their Diet, and even in their Conver&s;ation it &s;elf. They who have follow'd the profounder Studies, appear of|ten to have their thoughts di&s;tracted, as 'tis par|ticularly ob&s;erv'd of Mathematicians, their Minds being &s;o &s;teddily fix'd, that they cannot ea&s;ily un|bend them.</P>
<P>Hence it is that others, imagining the Merit lies in the Singularity, are glad to find it &s;o ea&s;ie a Matter to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves; the De&s;ire of doing which I take to be the Root of all Affecta|tion. To &s;ay Truth, the Men of Wit have, na|turally, their Share in the&s;e Imperfections. For as more &s;evere Studies require a very clo&s;e Appli|cation, theirs perhaps ingage it too little, and their Spirits are too volatile to give a long and con&s;tant Attention. This Ab&s;ence of theirs, if I may &s;o &s;peak, my Cou&s;in <HI>Humphry</HI> calls a Tax upon great Genius's, and &s;ays, he thinks it a Happine&s;s, when a Man of eminent Parts has nothing Particular to be known by, ei|ther when he walks the Street, or appears in Company. For which Rea&s;on, in talking over the Characters of Ingenious Men, I am frequently offended to hear People dwell upon &s;ome odd Circum&s;tances in their Behaviour. A certain Au|thor about Town is much celebrated for writing all his Works upon Backs of Letters, and Scraps of Paper. Another writ the be&s;t Part of his Poem upon old Cards, and had like to have lo&s;t Ten of the fine&s;t Lines in it, upon an Ace of Dia|monds, which he had unluckily mi&s;plac'd. A
<PB N="22" REF="25">
Third, of Immortal Memory, was wont to lie in his Perriwig, and caught a Cold that de&s;troy'd him, by wa&s;hing his Hands. The&s;e and many other Singularities ob&s;ervable in Men of extraor|dinary Talents, might, for ought one knows, be natural to them. But when <HI>Papilio</HI> &s;tudies for In|coherent An&s;wers to every Que&s;tion that is ask'd him, and makes Appointments on purpo&s;e to for|get them; 'tis a Que&s;tion among&s;t the Curious, Whether the Humour be natural or affected? I think it the mo&s;t favourable Opinion, that there is a Mixture of both. I have often with great Plea&s;ure con&s;idered the Character of my Friend <HI>Urbanus,</HI> who&s;e great Wit and Learning are in|deed accompanied with Singularities, &s;uch as are altogether Natural, but will, I doubt, meet with few Imitators: I mean his exce&s;&s;ive Candor, Mo|de&s;ty and good Nature. The Affectation of the&s;e Qualities would &s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;h any one that would be at the Pains to tran&s;cribe them, and the Con&s;equences of it would be of Service to the World. But to copy the Infirmities only of Great Men, and to quote their Example in our Defence, is making Precedents of them, where they lea&s;t de&s;ire to be &s;o, and perverting their Authority to give a Sanction to Folly.</P>

mu&s;t not dream but when they plea&s;e, nor upon long continued Subjects, however Vi&s;ionary in their own Natures; becau&s;e there is a manife&s;t Moral quite thro' them, which to produce as a Dream is improbable and unnatural.

Among other Things I met this Sage Ob&s;ervation, that a Lion would never hurt a true Virgin: With this Medly of Non&s;en&s;e in my Fancy I went to Bed, and dream'd that a Friend waked me in the Mor|ning, and propo&s;ed for Pa&s;time to &s;pend a few Hours in &s;eeing the Pari&s;h-Lions, which he had not done &s;ince he came to Town; and becau&s;e they &s;how'd but once a Week, he would not mi&s;s the Opportunity. I &s;aid I would humour him; tho', to &s;peak the Truth, I was not fond of tho&s;e cruel Spectacles, and if it were not &s;o ancient a Cu&s;tom, founded, as I had heard, upon the wi&s;e&s;t Maxims, I &s;hould be apt to cen|&s;ure the Inhumanity of tho&s;e who introduced it. All this will be a Riddle to the waking Reader, till I di&s;cover the Scene my Imagination had formed upon the Maxim, that a Lion would ne|ver hurt a true Virgin. I dream'd, that by a Law of Immemorial Time a He-Lion was kept in every Pari&s;h at the common Charge, and in a Place provided, adjoining to the Church-yard; That, before any one of the Fair Sex was married, if &s;he affirmed her &s;elf to be a Virgin, &s;he mu&s;t on her Wed|ding-Day, and in her Wedding-Cloaths, per|form the Ceremony of going alone into the Den, and &s;tay an Hour with the Lion let loo&s;e, and kept fa&s;ting Four and Twenty Hours on purpo&s;e. At a proper Height, above the Den, were convenient Galleries for the Relations and Friends of the Young Couple, and open to all Spectators. No Maiden was forced to offer her &s;elf to the Lion; but if &s;he refu&s;ed, it was a Di&s;grace to marry her, and every one might have Liberty of calling her a Whore. And me|thought it was as u&s;ual a Diver&s;ion to &s;ee the Pari&s;h-Lions, as with us to go to a Play or an
<PB N="25" REF="28">
Opera. And it was reckoned convenient to be near the Church, either for marrying the Vir|gin if &s;he e&s;caped the Trial, or for burying the Bones when the Lion had devoured the re&s;t, as he con&s;tantly did.</Q></P>
<P>To go on therefore with the Dream: <Q>We call'd fir&s;t (as I remember) to &s;ee St. <HI>Dun&s;tan</HI>'s Lion, but we were told they did not &s;hew to Day: From thence we went to that of <HI>Covent-Garden,</HI> which, to my great Surprize, we found as lean as a Skeleton, when I expected quite the contrary; but the Keeper &s;aid 'twas no Wonder at all, becau&s;e the poor Bea&s;t had not got an Ounce of Woman's Fle&s;h &s;ince he came into the Pari&s;h. This amaz'd me more than the other, and I was forming to my &s;elf a mighty Vene|ration for the Ladies in that Quarter of the Town, when the Keeper went on, and &s;aid, He wonder'd the Pari&s;h would be at the Charge of maintaining a Lion for nothing. Friend, (&s;aid I) do you call it Nothing, to ju&s;tify the Virtue of &s;o many Ladies, or has your Lion lo&s;t his di&s;tingui&s;hing Faculty? Can there be any Thing more for the Honour of your Pari&s;h, than that all the Ladies married in your Church were pure Virgins? That is true, (&s;aid he) and the Doctor knows it to his Sorrow, for there has not been a Couple married in our Church &s;ince his Wor&s;hip has been among&s;t us. The Virgins hereabouts are too wi&s;e to venture the Claws of the Lion; and becau&s;e no Body will marry them, have all entered into Vows of Vir|ginity. So that in Proportion we have much the large&s;t Nunnery in the whole Town. This Manner of Ladies entring into a Vow of Vir|ginity, becau&s;e they were not Virgins, I ea&s;ily conceiv'd, and my Dream told me, that the whole Kingdom was full of Nunneries, plenti|fully &s;tock'd from the &s;ame Rea&s;on.
<P><PB N="26" REF="29">
We went to &s;ee another Lion, where we found much Company met in the Gallery, the Keeper told us, we &s;hould &s;ee Sport enough, as he call'd it; and in a little Time, we &s;aw a young beautiful Lady put into the Den, who walk'd up towards the Lion with all imaginable Security in her Countenance, and look'd &s;mi|ling upon her Lover and Friends in the Gallery; which I thought nothing extraordinary, becau&s;e it was never known that any Lion had been mi&s;taken. But however, we were all Di&s;ap|pointed, for the Lion lifted up his Right Paw, which was the fatal Sign, and advancing for|ward, &s;eized her by the Arm, and began to tear it: The poor Lady gave a terrible &s;hriek, and cry'd out, <HI>The Lion is ju&s;t, I am no true Virgin,</HI> Oh! <HI>Sappho, Sappho.</HI> She could &s;ay no more, for the Lion gave her the <HI>Coup de Grace,</HI> by a &s;queeze in the Throat, and &s;he expir'd at his Feet. The Keeper dragg'd away her Body to feed the Animal when the Company was gone, for the Pari&s;h Lions never u&s;ed to eat in Pub|lick. After a little Pau&s;e, another Lady came on towards the Lion in the &s;ame Manner as the former; we ob&s;erv'd the Bea&s;t &s;mell her with great Diligence, he &s;cratch'd both her Hands with lifting them to his No&s;e, and clapping a Claw on her Bo&s;om, drew Blood; however he let her go, and at the &s;ame Time turned from her with a So<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">t of Contempt, at which &s;he was not a little mortify'd, and retired with &s;ome Confu&s;ion to her Friends in the Gallery. Me|thought the whole Company immediately un|der&s;tood the Meaning of this, that the Ea&s;ine&s;s of the Lady had &s;uffered her to admit certain impudent and dangerous Familiarities, border|ing too much upon what is Criminal; neither was it &s;ure whether the Lover then pre&s;ent had not &s;ome Sharers with him in tho&s;e Free|doms,
<PB N="27" REF="30">
of which a Lady can never be too &s;pa|ring.</P>
<P>This happened to be an extraordinary Day, for a Third Lady came into the Den, laughing loud, playing with her Fan, to&s;&s;ing her Head, and &s;miling round on the young Fellows in the Gallery. However, the Lion leap'd on her with great Fury, and we gave her for gone; but on a &s;udden he let go his Hold, turned from her as if he were nau&s;eated, then gave her a La&s;h with his Tail; after which &s;he returned to the Gal|lery, not the lea&s;t out of Countenance: And this, it &s;eems, was the u&s;ual Treatment of Co|quets.</P>
<P>I thought we had now &s;een enough, but my Friend would needs have us go and vi&s;it One or Two Lions in the City. We call'd at Two or Three Dens where they happen'd not to &s;hew, but we generally found half a Score young Girls, between Eight and Eleven Years Old, playing with each Lion, &s;itting on his Back, and putting their Heads into his Mouth; &s;ome of them would now and then get a Scratch; but we always di&s;cover'd, upon examining, that they had been hoydening with the young Ap|prentices. One of them was calling to a pretty Girl of about Twelve Years, that &s;tood by us in the Gallery, to come down to the Lion, and upon her Refu&s;al, &s;aid, <HI>Ah, Mi&s;s</HI> Betty, <HI>we could never get you to come near the Lion, &s;ince you play'd at Hoop and Hide with my Brother in the Garret.</HI> We followed a Couple, with the Wedding Folks, goint to the Church of St. <HI>Ma|ry-Ax</HI>'s. The Lady, though well &s;tricken in Years, extremely crooked and deform'd, was dre&s;s'd out beyond the Gaiety of Fifteen; ha|ving jumbled together, as I imagin'd, all the Tawd'ry Remains of Aunts, Godmothers, and Grandmothers, for &s;ome Generations pa&s;t:
<PB N="28" REF="31">
One of the Neighbours whi&s;per'd me that &s;he was an Old Maid, and had the cleare&s;t Repu|tation of any in the Pari&s;h. There is nothing &s;trange in that, thought I, but was much &s;ur|pris'd when I ob&s;erv'd afterwards that &s;he went towards the Lion with Di&s;tru&s;t and Concern. The Bea&s;t was lying down, but upon Sight of her, &s;nuff'd up his No&s;e Two or Three Times, and then giving the Sign of Death, proceeded in&s;tantly to Execution. In the mid&s;t of her A|gonies, &s;he was heard to name the Words, <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Artifices,</HI> with the utmo&s;t Horror, and &s;everal repeated Execrations: And at la&s;t concluded, <HI>Feel that I was, to put &s;o much Con|fidence in the Toughne&s;s of my Skin!</HI></P>
<P>The Keeper immediately &s;et all in order a|gain for another Cu&s;tomer, which happened to be a famous Prude, whom her Parents after long Threatnings, and much Per&s;wa&s;ion, had with the extreame&s;t Difficulty prevailed on to accept a young hand&s;ome Gold&s;mith, that might have pretended to five Times her Fortune. The Fathers and Mothers in the Neighbourhood u&s;ed to quote her for an Ex|ample to their Daughters. Her Elbows were rivetted to her Sides, and her whole Per&s;on &s;o order'd as to inform every Body that &s;he was afraid they &s;hould touch her. She only drea|ded to approach the Lion, becau&s;e it was a He one, and abhorr'd to think an Animal of that Sex &s;hould pre&s;ume to breathe on her. The Sight of a Man at Twenty Yards Di&s;tance made her draw back her Head. She always &s;ate upon the far|ther Corner of the Chair, tho' there were Six Chairs between her and her Lover, and with the Door wide open, and her little Si&s;ter in the Room. She was never &s;aluted but at the Tip of her Ear, and her Father had much ado to make her dine without her Gloves when there
<PB N="29" REF="32">
was a Man at Table. She enter'd the Den with &s;ome Fear, which we took to proceed from the Height of her Mode&s;ty, offended at the Sight of &s;o many Men in the Gallery. The Lion beholding her at a Di&s;tance, immediately gave the deadly Sign; at which the poor Crea|ture (methinks I &s;ee her &s;till) mi&s;carried in a Fright before us all. The Lion &s;eem'd to be &s;urpris'd as much as we, and gave her Time to make her Confe&s;&s;ion, <HI>That &s;he was Four Months gone, by the Fore-man of her Father's Shop, that this was her Third big Belly;</HI> and when her Friends ask'd, why &s;he would venture the Trial? She &s;aid, <HI>her Nur&s;e a&s;&s;ured her, that a Lion would never hurt a Woman with Child.</HI>" Upon this I immediately wak'd, and could not help wi&s;hing, that the Deputy-Cen&s;ors of my late In&s;titution were indu'd with the &s;ame In|&s;tinct as the&s;e Pari&s;h Lions were.</P></Q></P>

<P>Thus, as I before hinted, the be&s;t Part of my Time is &s;et apart for the Service and true Intere&s;t of the Fair. Many &s;leeple&s;s Nights, and Days of Anxiety, they have co&s;t me. Yet for all this, I do not find that I have any Degree of Intere&s;t in their Per&s;ons, or any Re&s;traint upon their Con|duct. Not a Furbelow has been &s;unk, nor a Yard of Whalebone parted with, to oblige me. Even my mo&s;t gentle Corrections and Penny-Po&s;t Inti|mations, have met with Neglect, Scorn and De|fiance. <HI>Bellaria</HI> is a provoking In&s;tance of this Kind; it has in good Earne&s;t &s;tood me in Three-Pence to reform her, and I do not find that &s;he is One Farthing the better for it. She is young, 'tis true, and may live to be wi&s;er: As her Beau|ty goes off, Prudence perhaps will grow upon her; but to be di&s;creet in the Height of her Charms, would be a much greater Merit. She knows the Faults I have charged her with, and mu&s;t thank her &s;elf if &s;he &s;hould hereafter
<PB N="33" REF="36">
oblige me to be more open and particular. <HI>Sempro|nia,</HI> with the &s;ame Aggravation, continues to be haughty, in&s;olent, and unnatural. She is the Mo|ther of Five beautiful Children, the elde&s;t not above Seven Years Old, whom &s;he never &s;peaks to, but with a De&s;ign to teize them, and u&s;es wor&s;e than any Animals that belong to her. Go|ing to her Coach the other Day, &s;he ob&s;erv'd Two or Three of them diverting them&s;elves in the Hall, and turning to her People, asked the Rea|&s;on why tho&s;e Brats lay litt'ring about the Hou&s;e.

<P>I was very much &s;urpris'd at &s;o odd a Pre&s;crip|tion, and having formerly had the Honour to know the Lady for who&s;e U&s;e it was intended, cou'd not help inquiring into the Occa&s;ion of it:
<PB N="34" REF="37">
With &s;ome Difficulty I inform'd my &s;elf, that <HI>Clo+rinda,</HI> whom all the World admir'd, was very lately di&s;pleas'd with her own Per&s;on. Some good natur'd Friend, it &s;eems, had put it in her Head that &s;he was growing too fat, and in a little Time wou'd be out of all Shape. This &s;ufficiently a|larm'd her, and from a Gaiety of Temper, that was peculiar to her, &s;he fell into Spleen, Vapours, and a Thou&s;and imaginary Di&s;quiets. There was no Ab&s;urdity &s;o gro&s;s that her Fears did not im|po&s;e upon her. As &s;he pa&s;s'd the Streets in her Chair, &s;he expected every Moment that the Fel|lows wou'd &s;ink under their Burden, and wou'd often &s;ay to her &s;elf, <HI>Ble&s;s me, how the poor Crea|tures blow!</HI> My Lady <HI>Kill-Chairman</HI>'s Shape was become the Object of her Envy, as it had former|ly been the Subject of her Ridicule. In &s;hort, a Con&s;ultation of the mo&s;t eminent Phy&s;icians was re&s;olv'd on, and a Cour&s;e of Acids, <HI>Cum Regimi|ne,</HI> was, it &s;eems, the Re&s;ult of it. As &s;oon as this came to my Knowledge, I &s;ent <HI>Clorinda</HI> a Letter, full of &s;uch pre&s;&s;ing Remon&s;trances, as the Occa&s;ion &s;ugge&s;ted to me. I conjur'd her with all the Tenderne&s;s of a Gallant, not to &s;uffer &s;o much Beauty to be lo&s;t to the World, by being over-curious to pre&s;erve it; nor that Bloom to wi|ther thro' an irreligious Mortification of her &s;elf.</P>
<P>After taking &s;o much Pains, to &s;ee my Advice neglected, and other Mea&s;ures pur&s;u'd, has, I own, &s;en&s;ibly touch'd me, both as an old Man, and a graduate Phy&s;ician. However, it is yet in the Power of <HI>Clorinda</HI> to retrieve what is pa&s;s'd: She has nothing more to do than to eat, drink, and &s;leep, to make her &s;elf again the Joy of her Friends, the De&s;ire of Mankind; and what is yet greater, (without Vanity be it &s;aid) to be heartily forgiven by the Cen&s;or of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>From my own Apartment, <DATE>February 2.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>'TIS a common Mi&s;take, tho' of very ill Con&s;equence, that many Failings and In|firmities are too clo&s;ely woven into our Con&s;titu|tions ever to be removed by any Pains or Appli|cation of our own. Had I &s;uffer'd my &s;elf to be|lieve this, I had been now one of the peevi&s;he&s;t old Fellows, as I was formerly one of the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate Youths, in the World. Till the Age of Sixteen I was never in good Humour two Hours together. I thought my &s;elf affronted by every one I met, and grew into a Proverb for the Violence of my Re&s;entments. I no &s;ooner came to the U&s;e of my Rea&s;on, but I began to cool a|pace, and have ever &s;ince pre&s;erved &s;uch an Even|ne&s;s of Temper as is not ea&s;ily ruffled, and which, under the greate&s;t Difficulties and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, has made me &s;uperior to them all.</P>
<P>I remember one Thing of my &s;elf in the Days of my Minority that was plea&s;ant enough: When|ever any Body had done me an ill Office, I u&s;ed, in the Bitterne&s;s of my Heart, to wi&s;h my &s;elf Par&s;on of the Pari&s;h for their Sake. He, I ob|&s;erved, had once a Week the Privilege of &s;peak|ing
<PB N="36" REF="39">
his Mind in publick, and of telling his Pa|ri&s;hioners their own. This, I thought, was a mighty Relief to his Spleen, and indeed the Doctor made U&s;e of it as if he had been of the &s;ame Opinion. He had a particular Felicity in finding out Texts to his Purpo&s;e, and no one Of|fence could be committed again&s;t him, that did not appear the next <HI>Sunday</HI> to be literally forbid|den in Scripture. The Top Gentleman in the Pari&s;h having one Day made him a Vi&s;it in a &s;triped Night-Gown, he looked upon this <HI>Di&s;ha|bilee</HI> as a Mark of Contempt; and the very next Time the Pulpit was his own, giving a Side-Glance towards the 'Squire's Pew, he pronounced with a loud Voice, <HI>Stripes are for the Backs of Fools,</HI> &amp;c. A poor Taylor had cabbaged &s;ome black Cloth that was put into his Hands, and the Text cho&s;en for his Reprimand was, <HI>Hell and De|&s;truction are before them;</HI> though towards the End of the Di&s;cour&s;e it was allowed, that <HI>a Rem|nant &s;hould be &s;aved.</HI></P>
<P>This petulant Humour of pro&s;tituting a pub|lick Capacity to particular Re&s;entments, is what I have indu&s;triou&s;ly avoided throughout the whole Cour&s;e of my Lucubrations. After the many Ob&s;ervations I have made upon humane Nature, it is, I confe&s;s, &s;ome Plea&s;ure to com|municate them to the Publick in the Manner I have cho&s;e to do it: But, unle&s;s in Ca&s;es where my Reputation has been openly attacked, I have never once intere&s;ted the World in any Di&s;putes relating to my &s;elf. Every Body knows what Provocations Mr. <HI>Powell</HI> gave me, and in how crowded a Theatre, before I would de&s;cend to take any Notice of him. When I did, it was in &s;uch a Manner, I thought, as all Controver&s;y ought to be managed between Scholars and Gen|tlemen. Mr. <HI>Morphew</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lillie</HI> obliged me to draw my Pen again&s;t them by a Piece of Ingra|titude
<PB N="37" REF="40">
that is hardly to be matched in Hi&s;tory. I had always treated tho&s;e Per&s;ons with a Re&s;pect due to their Characters, and as our Intere&s;ts were mutual, I flattered my &s;elf that our Affections were &s;o too. I know I &s;hall &s;uffer in the Opinion of &s;ome unforgiving People, when I make it known, that after &s;uch repeated Indignities I have again taken them into Favour. But as the following Petition was introduced to me by &s;ome of the fir&s;t Quality in this Kingdom, I can deny nothing to their Commands, nor indeed to the Dictates of my own Humanity.</P>

<P>THat whereas during your Honour's late Retirement in the remoter Parts of this Kingdom, we the &s;aid <HI>Charles Lillie</HI> and <HI>John Morphew,</HI> by and through the Means of evil and clande&s;tine Practices, In&s;inuations, and In|&s;tigations, &s;et on Foot by the avow'd Enemies of your Per&s;on and Authority, were unhappily moved and &s;educed to forfeit the Duty we owed to Both, by printing, publi&s;hing, di&s;per&s;ing, and cau&s;ing to be di&s;per&s;ed, &s;everal fal&s;e, &s;puri|ous, and illiterate Papers, as well as by affixing your Honour's Name thereunto: We do hereby humbly crave Leave to throw our &s;elves at your Feet, in &s;uch Manner and Po&s;ture as you in your Wi&s;dom &s;hall judge mo&s;t &s;uitable to our late Offences: Further craving, That we your Petitioners may be re&s;tored to our former Places, together with all the Fees, Profits, and
<PB N="38" REF="41">
Perqui&s;ites thereof. In order to which, we, in the mo&s;t humble Sen&s;e of our Crimes, and fill'd with a deep and hearty Sorrow for the &s;ame, do beg for our &s;elves and for each other, That the Su&s;pen&s;ion now lying on the &s;aid <HI>Charles Lillie,</HI> as al&s;o the late Sentence of De|privation pronounced on the &s;aid <HI>John Morphew,</HI> may be cancell'd and revers'd, in full Form, Or|der and Method, pur&s;uant to the Rules and Sta|tutes of the Court.</P>
<CLOSER>And your Petitioners &s;hall ever pray, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></CLOSER>

<P>It was an infinite Plea&s;ure to me the Day after I had rein&s;tated the Petitioners, to &s;ee the Faces of my old Officers about me. However, I would not have Mr. <HI>Kidney</HI> be in the lea&s;t di&s;couraged. The little Time he has been in Employment has rai&s;ed in me a ju&s;t E&s;teem for his good Qualities; and it is for his Sake that I give the follow|ing Adverti&s;ement a Place in this Part of my Pa|per:</P>
<Q>At St. <HI>James</HI>'s Coffeehou&s;e is to be &s;poken with a young Man, who can give a good Account of him|&s;elf, and has by long Pains and Study, acquired many u&s;eful Qualifications. He perfectly under|&s;tands the Art of making all Sorts of warm Liquors, has made great Proficiency in Geography, Politicks, and Arithmetick, writes &s;everal good Hands, and can to&s;s up a Ragoo, if Occa&s;ion be. He can &s;have, dre&s;s, tie up a Periwig, or take the Di&s;tance
<PB N="39" REF="42">
of Places. He is willing to go abroad and &s;ee the World with any young Gentleman that travels next Spring, or to be a Tutor in a Man of Quality's Family.</Q>
<P>Before I conclude, I am to acquaint my Rea|ders, That as I have again received my old Ser|vants, I have likewi&s;e renewed my former Re&s;o|lution of continuing this Work three Times a Week; &s;o, advi&s;ing Mrs. <HI>A. Baldwin</HI> to u&s;e great Indu&s;try in her Bu&s;ine&s;s, I bid her heartily Fare|wel.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> Having commi&s;&s;ioned my Printer to di|&s;tingui&s;h this Paper by what Number he thinks proper, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, That from <HI>Jan.</HI> 2. tho&s;e only of Numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, belong to this Set, in order to compleat the Fifth Volume of the&s;e Lucubrations.</P>

<P>THat Activity or Re&s;tle&s;ne&s;s of Thought, that De&s;ire of doing &s;omething, which is natural to almo&s;t every Body, does, when rightly appli|ed, give Birth to many great and noble Enter|prizes; but when it falls under the Direction of a fanta&s;tical Judgment, it becomes trouble&s;ome and ridiculous to all the World. On one Side, it con|tributes to the Characters of the greate&s;t Gene|rals, and the wi&s;e&s;t State&s;men; and on the other, it furni&s;hes publick Conver&s;ations with Bu&s;y Bo|dies and Buffoons. I have ob&s;erved <HI>Will Worth|le&s;s</HI> for a long Time about this Town labouring under a prodigious Impatience of being di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd as a Man of &s;ome Sort of Figure or other. At his fir&s;t coming from the Univer&s;ity, he &s;et up for a great Unbeliever; for which Rea&s;on, as likewi&s;e becau&s;e he was afraid to be in a Room by him&s;elf, he &s;pent mo&s;t of his Time at the <HI>Graecian.</HI> But not arriving to any great Eminence in Infidelity, he turned him&s;elf with great Appli|cation to the Calling of a Virtuo&s;o. To equip him&s;elf for this, he travel'd twice into <HI>Italy,</HI> from
<PB N="41" REF="44">
whence, at great Expence, he brought back a &s;o|lemn Face, with the Reputation of knowing as much as he did when he went out. Being now greatly accompli&s;h'd for the Service of his Coun|try, he thought it was high Time to take Care of the Con&s;titution; and to that End, without Fear or Wit, leap'd at once over Head and Ears into publick Bu&s;ine&s;s. From that Time to this he has liv'd in a profe&s;s'd Cour&s;e of Gravity. I have had more frequent Opportunities of conver&s;ing with him than I could have wi&s;h'd. For taking me by my Age to be a Man for his Purpo&s;e, he has in a Manner forced him&s;elf upon my Acquaintance. He has told me with great Frankne&s;s, That he thinks it below a rea&s;onable Man either to laugh or drink Wine, and that he has laid down &s;ome Rules to him&s;elf as e&s;&s;ential to the Character he affects: <Q REND="inline">"To pre&s;erve a &s;tedfa&s;t Countenance, to whi&s;per in Coffee-hou&s;es, to &s;have but twice a Week, and to wear but one Loop to his Hat; to read nothing but the Votes, and to keep Company with his Father. He has &s;ometimes &s;aid with as much Plea&s;ure as his Face is capa|ble of, Well, Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff,</HI> nothing &s;ure is &s;o &s;olid a Satisfaction as Bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;For my Part, I love it &s;o well, that I can't like a Propo&s;al the wor&s;e for having been rejected;"</Q> and to do him Ju&s;tice, he has been a true Friend to di|&s;tre&s;&s;ed Projects, and as good as a Father to Bills in Di&s;grace. He receives more Petitions than a Fir&s;t Mini&s;ter, and &s;olicits the Affairs of all the mad Beggars about Town. <HI>Monday</HI> la&s;t I was obliged upon &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s to go to his Levee. I found with him, over Bohea and Bread and But|ter, Ju&s;tice <HI>Upper&s;ide</HI> and Sir <HI>Paul Marmalade.</HI> Upon my coming in, Mr. <HI>Worthle&s;s,</HI> who &s;ate next the Fire, ro&s;e up and forced me into his Chair. The Ju&s;tice, with an innocent Smile in his Face, and his Cane at his Mouth, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Mr. <HI>Bicker|&s;taff,</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="45">
you can tell us; Pray, Sir, what are all the&s;e In&s;urances upon Births and Marriages, will they come to any Thing or no? Before I could an&s;wer, he went on, Why really, Sir, I would be glad Gentlemen would con&s;ider, eve|ry Nation con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of Men and Women. How! &s;ays Sir <HI>Paul,</HI> do you make nothing of Children?"</Q> The Ju&s;tice, &s;haking his Head, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"My good Friend Sir <HI>Paul,</HI> you don't take me; but what I would offer, is this, If Mar|riages are hindered, Procreation in a legal Way will cea&s;e, and the Con&s;equence of that every one knows. However, if no Body el&s;e takes Notice of it, I am &s;ure I &s;han't&mdash;'Tis not my Bu&s;ine&s;s to find Faults'&mdash;</Q>Mr. <HI>Worthle&s;s</HI> &s;topping him &s;hort, cried, <Q REND="inline">"Pray take me along with you; for unle&s;s the Per&s;ons marrying be equal to the Per&s;ons married, where is your Ballance? For I take it, a Nation may be over as well as under married."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Well, &s;ays Sir <HI>Paul,</HI> I don't love di&s;puting in Company, but you would have a hard Matter to make that out."</Q> This weighty Conver&s;ation was interrupted by Captain <HI>My&s;tery,</HI> who came in from his Round of Levees, with a Face of great Hurry and Impor|tance: <Q REND="inline">"Gentlemen, &s;ays he, you little think where I have been this Morning&mdash;Hark you Mr. <HI>Worthle&s;s,</HI> a Word in your Ear. All out&mdash;Ships&mdash;Command&mdash;A Blockhead and a Coward, and all their Hands to it&mdash;'Tis a little hard tho' that neither Side &s;hould take any Notice of one'&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>This was all I overheard of his Whi&s;per, when a Servant came and told Mr. <HI>Worthle&s;s,</HI> there were &s;everal People at the Door who de&s;ired to &s;peak with his Honour. Leave of Audience be|ing given, the fir&s;t that entered was Don <HI>Cava|liero de Tri&s;to Figure.</HI> The Solemnity of his Air, joined with the mi&s;erable Habit he was in, was a
<PB N="43" REF="46">
mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Burle&s;que upon the Humour of his Country. He had in his Hand a Bundle of Pa|pers, much ob&s;cured with Filth, and of a Fra|grancy not to be endured. The&s;e he pre&s;ented to the Patriot, who gave me to under&s;tand, that they contained a &s;hort and ea&s;y Expedient to &s;ettle the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> on the Throne of <HI>Spain,</HI> whi&s;pering at the &s;ame Time, that he ve|rily believed this Gentleman to be of the Blood Royal.</P>
<P>The next, as I under&s;tood from him, was one Mrs. <HI>James,</HI> a little ancient Gentlewoman, in a Pair of very high Pattins, who, with much Anxiety and Hunger in her Countenance, de&s;ired his Honour, with a low Voice, and in a Language that I hardly under&s;tood, <Q REND="inline">"To attend her Bu&s;i|ne&s;s in the Hou&s;e, for that it was now ju&s;t rea|dy to come on;"</Q> and it &s;eems it has been in the &s;ame Forwardne&s;s for the&s;e Thirty Years pa&s;t. She withdrew with great Humility, and repeat|ed Courte&s;ies, to make Room for a Third. Mr. <HI>Worthle&s;s</HI> took me a&s;ide, and told me, <Q REND="inline">"That this was a Gentleman who in his younger Days &s;tudied the Law; but having failed in that, had now put him&s;elf into the fanta&s;tical Habit I &s;aw, and under it was one of the deepe&s;t Heads in the World. He has attended me, &s;ays he, the&s;e Three Years, with a Project to &s;ave <HI>England,</HI> and I know not yet whether I &s;hall bring it to bear."</Q> I was by this Time heartily tired, and in proper Form took Leave of the Company, not knowing whether I ought mo&s;t to commi&s;erate the Misfortunes of the&s;e poor Wretches, or contemn and expo&s;e the Fol|lies of their Patron.</P>

I had indeed prepared another for the Pre&s;s, but about an Hour before the Printer called upon me, I chan|ced to look into a little Coffee-hou&s;e in our Row, where I found lying open upon the Table the following Epi&s;tle, a Steel Ring of Keys, and a Bra&s;s Seal with an Anchor engraved on it on one Side, and a &s;hort Piece of dirty Sealing-Wax on the other. I was &s;o plea&s;ed with the Style and Orthography of it, that I could not but wonder at the Carele&s;ne&s;s of the Per&s;on who, as I &s;up|po&s;ed, after writing an An&s;wer, had left &s;o va|luable a Piece behind him; and knowing no readier Way to put it into his Hands again, re|&s;olved to make it publick by the fir&s;t Opportu|nity.</P>

<P>THough I happen to be de&s;cended from a Melancholy Father, and a Hypochondrix Mother, I was not till my Fortieth Year made &s;en&s;ible that Infirmities of this Kind are commu|nicated from Parents to their Children. 'Twas about that Time that the College Clock run|ning mightily in my Head, I could not help fancying my &s;elf to be &s;o nearly related to it, that I was obliged not to &s;peak but when that &s;trook. My Cou&s;in, the Clock happening &s;oon after to be down with a Di&s;order, I heard no|thing of him for a Week together, during which Time I could not be prevailed upon to &s;peak one Syllable; and it being my Turn to read a publick Lecture, I was forced to &s;end my Ex|cu&s;e in Writing.</P>
<P>This Fit going off, I was my &s;elf for Half a Year afterwards; but &s;itting much by the Com|mon-Room Fire, I had a &s;trange Fancy that I was a Poker, and if any Body talked of filling a Pipe, I immediately moved off for fear they &s;hould make U&s;e of me to light it. Upon the lea&s;t Indi&s;po&s;ition, I had no Notion of going to any Body but the Smith to be mended. After this, I took my &s;elf for the College Gate, and lay under a con&s;tant Apprehen&s;ion of being &s;e|verely thumped at all Hours of the Night.
<PB N="47" REF="50">
Would you think it, Sir? At la&s;t this Whim went &s;o far, that I verily believed my &s;elf to be your Paper, the <HI>Tatler,</HI> Then, though I had &s;ometimes the Plea&s;ure of thinking that I was mightily commended, at others I had inexpre&s;|&s;ible Fears. I fancied, that a Friend of mine who had taken Phy&s;ick, was looking for me high and low on a very unworthy Occa&s;ion, and was wonderfully delighted when my Bro|ther, the <HI>Gazette,</HI> was made U&s;e of in my Stead. I was often vexed at my Heart to be hung al|mo&s;t all over with Adverti&s;ements of In&s;uran|ces, Morning-Gowns, Lap-Dogs, and Lottery Tickets, and now and then had terrible Unea|&s;ine&s;s for having made bold with my Betters. Being at length pretty well recovered of this Fit, I thought it advi&s;able to come to <HI>London</HI> and take Care of my Health: But as I was go|ing to the Coach, to my great Surprize, I found my &s;elf turned into a Foot-ball, and at the Mercy of a Pack of Scoundrels, who, without any Re|gard to the Dignity of my former Characters, kicked me from one End of the <HI>High-&s;treet</HI> to the other. During this la&s;t Misfortune, I have been made the unwilling In&s;trument of break|ing many Windows, and once of flying in the Face of a Civil Magi&s;trate. For this Rea&s;on I am, as you may very well imagine, a&s;hamed to &s;hew my Head; and being from my Spherical Figure incapable of Writing my &s;elf, I have begged a Friend to con&s;ult you in my Name up|on this my deplorable Condition, and to tell you, that I hope in &s;ome Time I &s;hall be able to a&s;&s;ure you of my being my own Man, and</P>

In our Conver&s;ation he &s;eemed to &s;hew that Sort of Diffidence which u&s;ually attends Men of the be&s;t Sen&s;e, after having pa&s;&s;ed their Lives in Retirement.

Af|ter an Hour's Talk, having indu&s;triou&s;ly led him through &s;everal Subjects, I found him to be of an excellent Under&s;tanding, cultiva|ted by the Knowledge of the be&s;t Author of Antiquity, and of a perfect good Ta&s;te to point out their Beauties. Among&s;t the re&s;t, he &s;hewed me many In&s;tances of the Sublime in the Holy Writings, which I had not heard any one before ob&s;erve; &s;o that upon the Whole, all the Difference I could find be|tween us both in Point of knowing the World, was, that he had been chiefly conver|&s;ant with the be&s;t Part of it, and I with the wor&s;t.</P>

He had no Ha&s;te in his Countenance, and &s;ate with me above two Hours without any vi&s;ible Impatience to be going. He appeared to have Abundance of good Nature without the &s;neaking mercenary Affectation of it, and mentioned with Honour as many of his own Profe&s;&s;ion as are allowed to de&s;erve it. He received no Me&s;&s;age all the while we were together; and I ob&s;erved par|ticularly, that he di&s;cour&s;ed often as if he be|lieved Revealed Religion. We dined toge|ther, and he carved up a Pullet without read|ing

a Lecture of Anatomy upon it. He &s;eem|ed to be of a facetious Wit, and after a few Gla&s;&s;es of Wine would now and then let off a Quibble, without thinking it any Di&s;parage|ment to his Under&s;tanding. I took the fir&s;t Opportunity to enquire of my Friend into the Character of this Gentleman, who&s;e Account was, That he had many Years belonged to the Faculty, that he was an admirable Scholar, and very knowing in his Profe&s;&s;ion; but be|ing born a Gentleman, and to a competent Fortune of his own, he di&s;dained the &s;ervile Ways of making Court to Nur&s;es and Apothe|caries, and therefore his chief Practice lay a|mong the Poor. He never valued his Reputa|tion equal to the Life of a Patient, and often pre&s;erved the latter, though by tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing a|gain&s;t Form and Method. He was once com|ing into Bu&s;ine&s;s, but lo&s;t it by per&s;wading his Patients they were not &s;ick, and refu&s;ing their Fees.</P>
<P>The other Mr. <HI>Tru&s;ty</HI> has recommended to me, is a young Gentleman under Twenty, and a Nephew of his own. His Per&s;on is graceful, his Eyes quick and lively, the Tone of his Voice agreeable, his Look open, affable and &s;erene, his Con&s;titution vigorous and &s;anguine, his Air, Dre&s;s and Behaviour, ea&s;y, mode&s;t and unaffected. He has been bred under the Care and Direction of his Uncle, who, I remember, often u&s;ed to &s;ay to me, <Q REND="inline">"I will undertake, <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> to make this Boy have as much u&s;eful Knowledge at Nineteen, as you or I have at Fifty."</Q> This he has effected beyond what I could po&s;&s;ibly have conceived, and the Methods he has taken to do it, &s;hall hereafter in one or more of the&s;e Papers be communicated to the Publick.

It is a Violence to my Na|ture to act any Thing that is rigid and &s;e|vere; but I very much que&s;tion whether I &s;hall not be &s;hortly obliged to do exem|plary Ju&s;tice on the aforementioned Ac|count.

<P>YOur Order, dated the 13th of <HI>Janua|ry,</HI> came to Hand the 18th of the &s;ame Month; and within the Time by you limited, the Church-wardens and Sides|men of this our Pari&s;h of <HI>Fatland</HI> repair|ed to the Ve&s;try thereunto belonging; and having debated for the Space of Three Quarters of an Hour, without Eating or Drinking all that Time, they did then and there chu&s;e, elect and nominate me <HI>John Hart</HI> Gent. to act in full Power and Au|thority as Rural Cen&s;or of the &s;aid Pa|ri&s;h, and did notify the &s;ame to me by <HI>Jeremiah Solfa,</HI> Clerk of the &s;aid Pari&s;h, who, by Order of the &s;aid Church war|dens and Sides-men, having fir&s;t wa&s;hed

<P>I am very &s;en&s;ible, Honoured Sir, how unworthy I am to repre&s;ent &s;o great a Man as your &s;elf in &s;o high a Station, having little more to brag of than the Hone&s;ty of my Intentions, and a hearty De&s;ire to be &s;erviceable to my Country. I will be bold to &s;ay, that no Body &s;hall outdo me in tho&s;e Points, whatever they may in &s;ome others. Since I have come into Employment, it has been my whole Bu&s;ine&s;s to ob&s;erve and remark careful|ly the Behaviour of my Fellow Pari&s;hio|ners, which is for the mo&s;t Part as I could wi&s;h. I was always well e&s;teemed among them, but upon this Preferment I am in a Manner wor&s;hipped. I have already been invited to Two Chri&s;tenings, and &s;everal Junketings, which I hope will be no Re|flection upon my Character, having heard, that you your &s;elf, Sir, will take a chir|ping Cup upon Occa&s;ion.

As I was &s;aying, Sir, I am migh|tily

re&s;pected at pre&s;ent, and very often dine with the be&s;t Gentleman in the Pa|ri&s;h, in who&s;e Family I have ob&s;erved &s;ome Matters which I think it my Duty to acquaint you with. His elde&s;t Daughter, Mrs. <HI>Su&s;an,</HI> and his &s;econd Son, Mr. <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">|naby,</HI> who had before lived altogether in the Country, have been up at <HI>London</HI> Three Weeks of this Winter, and by the Improvements they have made there, are become a Trouble to the whole Neigh|bourhood. The young Lady takes upon her to laugh at every Thing, and every Body that comes in her Way, and is ever and anon twitting the good Lady her Mo|ther with having never &s;een any Thing of the World. I believe, if the Truth were known, &s;he has invented Fifty Foole|ries in her Dre&s;s, on Purpo&s;e to bring 'em into Fa&s;hion, and in Proce&s;s of Time make the whole County ridiculous. The very Heels of her Shoes are laced, her Head not above an Inch high; &s;he has Stuff enough in her Petticoat to cloath all her Brothers and Si&s;ters, and at the &s;ame Time is naked her &s;elf half Way down her Back. I ob&s;erved t'other Day a little Spoon in her Snuff-Box, and could not help ask|ing her, Whether &s;he hid it there upon a Report we had lately about calling in the Plate?</P>
<P>The young Gentleman is to the full as bad in his Way: His Cloaths are intole|rably api&s;h and fanta&s;tical, and he will face us down, that a Thou&s;and of the &s;ame Make were &s;een on Her Maje&s;ty's Birth-Day. He has brought down a Set of new Words, to the great Confu&s;ion of common
<PB N="64" REF="67">

<P>IT is certain that mo&s;t of our Errors, whe|ther in Conver&s;ation or Conduct, are ow|ing to Want of Reflection, and a right Way of Thinking. The Privilege of applying our Fa|culties that Way, is the noble&s;t Di&s;tinction of our Nature, and of the la&s;t Con&s;equence to the Regulation of our Lives. This I do not offer as a new Ob&s;ervation, but only as the general Neglect of it, and at the &s;ame Time the Impor|tance of its being rightly under&s;tood, make it nece&s;&s;ary to be put often in our Way. What|ever Improvements or Acqui&s;itions we make without this Foundation, are but &s;uperficial and Ornamental at be&s;t, and will never &s;upport us through any Figure or Character in the World: For which Rea&s;on, when the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Day, and the innocent Entertainments of the Evening are at an End, I con&s;tantly &s;et apart an Hour at lea&s;t to de&s;cend into my &s;elf, to weigh and examine my pa&s;t Behaviour, and the Principles I have acted upon. The little Lei|&s;ure
<PB N="66" REF="69">
I thus &s;teal from the Publick is returned to them, by endeavouring to become more perfect in the &s;everal Relations I bear to Mankind.</P>
<P>In this Manner I was employing my Thoughts &s;ome Nights ago, when going towards my Window. I heard a Watchman in the Street cry, <HI>Pa&s;t Twelve of the Clock, and a Moon-light Morning.</HI> Another, who came ju&s;t after him, called the &s;ame Hour, <HI>and a cloudy Morning.</HI> He who had declared him&s;elf fir&s;t, thinking his Veracity in Que&s;tion, turned round in &s;ome Anger, and in a low &s;ullen Voice gave the o|ther the Lie. Words were multiplied upon it, and Blows followed. I immediately threw up my Sa&s;h, and had Authority enough to part them. For my own Part, I looked upon it to be a very bright Sky, and therefore gave the Fellow a Reprimand that had pronounced it otherwi&s;e: But when he a&s;&s;ured me, that at the very In&s;tant he did &s;o, a Cloud was ju&s;t co|ming over the Moon, the Cau&s;e was puzzled, and I did not know ju&s;tly where to lay the Blame. However, having made up the Mat|ter, I pulled down my Window, and retired to Bed. Before I fell a&s;leep, I could not help re|flecting on the Oddne&s;s of this Di&s;pute, and to make it of &s;ome U&s;e to my &s;elf, re&s;olved I would never more engage in Controver&s;y with Mr. <HI>Powell</HI> or any other Per&s;on.</P>

<P>I could not but be much &s;urprized at &s;o ex|traordinary an Account, and doubting the Truth of it, went <HI>incognito</HI> the next Night to the Hou&s;e, where I found my Corre&s;pondent had but too good Grounds for triumphing over me in the Manner he had done.</P>
<P>After being heartily tired with the Fir&s;t Act, I had Lei&s;ure to con&s;ider the extraordinary Re|ception of the&s;e Foreign Entertainments, and the Di&s;couragement of our own Mu&s;ick. I could no otherwi&s;e account for it, than by ha|ving Recour&s;e to a certain Journal that had a little before fallen into my Hands, in which I find, that on the Fir&s;t of <HI>November</HI> la&s;t the Hou&s;e of Ladies came to this Re&s;olution:<Q>Re&s;olved, That Mr. <HI>Waller</HI> never writ a good Song, That Mr. <HI>Clayton</HI> cannot &s;et one, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Mrs. <HI>Tofts</HI> &s;ing one.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="71">
In this Debate, I am told they all &s;poke, and all at once; &s;o it being impo&s;&s;ible for them to know what each other &s;aid, I could never learn the Rea&s;ons that induced that honourable Hou&s;e to pa&s;s &s;o cruel a Vote. Two are chiefly al|ledged without Doors to ju&s;tify this Severity. The Fir&s;t is, That our Language is &s;o uncooth as not to be endured, and calculated only for Acts of Parliament. The Gentleman that made this Objection, appeared at my Court Ye&s;ter|day, where being tried for Slander, after ha|ving made a &s;mooth Defence in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue, he was found guilty, and &s;entenced to &s;peak no other Words than <HI>Otway</HI> and <HI>Waller</HI> for the <HI>Space</HI> of Nine Days; as likewi&s;e to tran|&s;late the <HI>Mira</HI> of Mr. <HI>G&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI> into <HI>High-Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>The Second Rea&s;on, which is, the Want of Performers, has been pre&s;&s;ed to me with all A&s;|&s;urance of Succe&s;s: But the Per&s;ons who pre|&s;umed &s;o far, upon a very &s;olemn Trial, were found guilty al&s;o by a very fair Jury, &s;entenced to beg Mrs. <HI>Tofts</HI>'s and Mr. <HI>Leveridge</HI>'s Pardon upon their Knees, and fined One thou&s;and Pound each for the U&s;e of the Queen of <HI>Cyprus,</HI> who&s;e Trea&s;ures are exhau&s;ted, and her Terri|tories invaded. I, who am advanced in Years, and have neither Lei&s;ure nor Application for the Attainment of a Language I as yet know little of, have more than ordinary Rea&s;on to be apprehen&s;ive of its encroaching too far up|on us. Should it univer&s;ally prevail, I am in a Manner debarred the Commerce of Mankind, and my Lucubrations of Cour&s;e fall to the Ground. I could wi&s;h it were further con&s;ide|red, how great Sufferers a con&s;iderable Part of my Fellow-Subjects would be, if we took away only the U&s;e of a few Words, and whether any that can be &s;ub&s;tituted in their Stead,

<P>After all, I am credibly informed by &s;ome of the Royal Society, that there is &s;omething in the Formation of a Tramontane Ear, that will not &s;uffer it to reli&s;h the Softne&s;s of <HI>Italian</HI> Airs; and further, that Sound it &s;elf, at &s;o ma|ny Degrees Northward, was never known to come to perfect Maturity: Only that of Drums, Trumpets, Hautboys, and here and there as much of the Vocal as will &s;erve to keep a pri|vate Family in Order, being of our own Growth, and agreeing tolerably well with the Climate.</P>

<P>IT is ob&s;ervable of Men of ba&s;e Extraction and low Education, that when they have any Thing in them of what the World calls good Sen&s;e, they turn it wholly to the getting of Money. They have but that one Point in View, and con&s;equently overlook all either difficult or indirect Ways which lead to it.</P>
<P>If they attain their End, and become rich toward their middle Age, before they decline in Years, and decay in Strength, and that their Appetite of Getting is not yet turned into an Avarice of Hoarding, if they have any Fire re|maining, they commonly feel them&s;elves war|med with a Kind of Ambition of being Some|body, as well as Something. They find a Want of that Re&s;pect which they ob&s;erve to be paid to &s;uch who are called Gentlemen, and Per&s;ons of Condition, though of &s;mall Fortunes. They would give any Con&s;ideration to be of an honourable De&s;cent, and alter the Spelling of their Names to bring them on as near as po&s;|&s;ible
<PB N="72" REF="75">
to &s;ome Name or Seat of Antiquity. If that cannot be brought about, they pu&s;h for a Knighthood, or an Alliance with &s;ome Family of Name or Title, who&s;e Follies or Misfortunes have reduced them to match them&s;elves or Children to Money, however ba&s;ely lodged, or infamou&s;ly obtained.</P>
<P>I fell into this Reflection after a Vi&s;it made me &s;ome Days &s;ince by one whom I remember to have known a Link-Boy, and who has often lighted me formerly from the <HI>Green-Dragon</HI> in <HI>Fleet-&s;treet</HI> to my Lodgings in <HI>Sheer-lane.</HI> We u&s;ed to call him <HI>Foundling,</HI> a Name given him by his Godfather the Pari&s;h, and which he has not yet been able to part with, or vary, though he has found the Secret to be worth very near what they call a Plumb, and upon <HI>'Change</HI> has obtained the Appellation of a good Man. He came to me with much Frankne&s;s, owning both his pa&s;t and pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances; but what made me, &s;mile, was, the Reque&s;t he made me to accompany him to a Hou&s;e in our Row, where lives one <HI>Randall</HI> (as he called him) <HI>a Creature Merchant.</HI> This Per&s;on is a great Vir|tuo&s;o, and deals in Birds and Bea&s;ts, though not either as a Butcher or Poulterer; for he nouri&s;hes nothing that is eatable, nor ever ut|ters any Commodity but while it is alive.</P>
<P>As we walked towards this Virtuo&s;o's Habi|tation, which I may call an Abridgment of the Ark, my Friend <HI>Foundling</HI> told me, <Q REND="inline">"He had purcha&s;ed a fair Seat in the Country, That he had a Mind to appear well in the World; and &s;ince he had a Gentleman's E&s;tate, he would endeavour to have every Thing &s;ui|table to it; That he had bargained already with the Herald's College for a Coat of Arms; and that his pre&s;ent Errand to <HI>Ran|dall</HI>'s was, from among his Variety, of Ani|mals

to fancy him&s;elf a Cre&s;t, in which he mightily de&s;ired my A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Approba|tion."</Q> I was delighted with the Folly and Frankne&s;s of the Man; but it happened he &s;aw nothing that plea&s;ed him. As we returned, I advi&s;ed him to an hone&s;t home-bred Cre&s;t out of his own Farmers Yard, which was a Cock's Head untrim'd, with the Gills and Comb en|tire. This he approved, and took his Leave. I was about to reflect on what had pa&s;s'd, when &s;uddenly returning he called to me, and co|ming nearer, told me, he would let me into all his Project, and de&s;ired I would &s;tep with him to a Waterman's Hou&s;e hard by, where he had lodged a Set of Ance&s;tors, which were to go up next Tide to his Seat upon the River. He de&s;ired my Judgment of the Choice he had made of Three Generations to furni&s;h his Par|lor. I went with him, not readily compre|hending what he meant, till we enter'd the Hou&s;e, where he explained to me, that at <HI>Fleet-Ditch</HI> he had bought the Pictures of Three Men and Three Women, which were &s;uited well enough to each other, and were to per&s;onate his Family up to his Great-Grand|father and Great-Grandmother, which he thought was pretending far enough for one who was in Truth related to no Body that he knew of in the World. As I was extremely diverted with the Oddne&s;s and Extravagance of the Man's Fancy, I was no le&s;s &s;atisfied with his Judgment in the Choice of the Pictures; the Habits and Di&s;po&s;itions of the Figures be|ing &s;uited to Three different Periods and Fa|&s;hions of Time, and concluding, or rather be|ginning, in the Great-Grandfather and Great-Grandmother, with a Pair of Trunk-Ho&s;e, a Ruff, and a Farthingale. I plea&s;ed him with my Approbation, and took Leave of him, en|tertaining

My Si&s;ter,
<PB N="79" REF="82">
the unfortunate <HI>Fidelia,</HI> the be&s;t, the &s;ofte&s;t, and the faire&s;t of her Sex, is even now on the Brink of Di&s;traction. Her Perplexity is beyond all Example, and indeed the Occa&s;ion of it very extraordinary. It is now Three Years and upwards &s;ince Two young Gen|tlemen of Birth and Fortune, who had lived together in the &s;tricte&s;t Friend&s;hip, became Rivals on her Account. Both &s;o equally me|rited her E&s;teem, that for &s;ome Time &s;he knew not on which to be&s;tow her Love. The one was of an open Behaviour, warm in his Preten&s;ions, but not over con&s;tant in his Application; the other clo&s;e, a&s;&s;iduous, and importunate. However it happened, &s;he was at la&s;t determined in Favour of the lat|ter; and, with a Heart never before engaged in an Affair of this Kind, gave at once into all the Softne&s;&s;es and Indearments of it. <HI>Po|lydor</HI> (if I may &s;o call the neglected Lover) now found him&s;elf but coldly received; yet, with an unexpected Evenne&s;s of Temper, con|tinued &s;till to vi&s;it my Si&s;ter; upon the Foot of a Friend, a Platonick, or what el&s;e &s;he would plea&s;e to call him. In the mean Time, the Father of <HI>Ca&s;talio,</HI> his Rival, had &s;ome Intimation given him of his Intrigue, and that he intended to marry <HI>Fidelia,</HI> who&s;e Fortune, tho' better than Six thou&s;and Pounds, was by no Means an&s;werable to what he propo&s;ed for his Son. Without taking any further Notice, he &s;ent for him, and having a con&s;iderable E&s;tate at <HI>Fort St. George,</HI> in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> made the Care of that a Pre|tence for di&s;patching him thither. In &s;hort, <HI>Fidelia</HI> and he were forced to part, with a Flood of Tears, and the u&s;ual Vows to each other. Two Years almo&s;t pa&s;t before any Thing was heard of him; then came the
<PB N="80" REF="83">
News of his Death, confirmed by &s;o many Hands, and &s;uch particular Circum&s;tances, that there was no Room to doubt the Truth of it. <HI>Polydor</HI> all this while had gone on in the &s;ame Road of an innocent Acquaintance with my Si&s;ter, and as &s;he ever pre&s;erved a good Re&s;pect for him, now, under her Af|fliction, &s;he found the U&s;e of his Friend&s;hip. Who could &s;o properly condole with her the Lo&s;s of <HI>Ca&s;talio,</HI> as the Man who had loved him beyond his own Quiet and Happine&s;s? To whom could &s;he &s;o freely communicate her Grief, as to one who knew her Weakne&s;s, and had long &s;ince forgiven her the cruele&s;t Effects of it? Thus, Sir, by mingling their Sorrows, they fell in&s;en&s;ibly into a Tender|ne&s;s for each other. His Flame revived with greater Violence than ever, and &s;he on a &s;ud|den wonder'd at the Progre&s;s &s;he had made, before &s;he well knew where &s;he was. Con|&s;idering her &s;elf as a Kind of Widow, &s;he re|&s;olved to continue &s;uch till a Twelvemonth was expired. She did &s;o, and having appoin|ted <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> la&s;t for her Wedding Day, ju&s;t as &s;he was going out, &s;he was met by <HI>Ca&s;ta|lio</HI> at the Door. In the mid&s;t of Joy and Confu&s;ion, &s;he flew to him, and fainted in his Arms. What Mea&s;ures, good Mr. <HI>Bicker|&s;taff,</HI> can be taken in this Affair? <HI>Polydor</HI> raves like a Madman, walks the Streets with his Sword drawn, and in ca&s;e he is di&s;ap|pointed, threatens De&s;truction to all about him. <HI>Ca&s;talio</HI> bewails <HI>Fidelia</HI> and him&s;elf, commi&s;erates his Friend, and upbraids his Father that had intercepted his Letters, and purcha&s;ed of &s;everal <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Men the Report of his Death: But my Si&s;ter&mdash;&s;he alas! is lo&s;t to all Rea&s;on; and if &s;he were not, the Truth is, I have none to offer upon this

</LETTER>
<P>The Ca&s;e of <HI>Fidelia,</HI> as well as that of the Pretenders to her, is indeed very deplorable; and the more &s;o, becau&s;e having carefully per|u&s;ed the Records belonging to the <HI>Court of Ho|nour,</HI> I cannot from thence inform my &s;elf how to proceed, or in whom to ve&s;t the Right of her Per&s;on.

In the mean Time, to &s;peak upon it in an extrajudicial Way, if the Lady happens to be of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Per&s;ua&s;ion, I advi&s;e her to a Nunnery; if not, and &s;he be qualified as her Brother has repre&s;ented, I know a certain old Gentleman who will be well enough plea&s;ed to take her off with all her Misfortunes and Infir|mities about her. By having frequent Oppor|tunities of in&s;tilling the Precepts of Philo&s;ophy, he may in Time alleviate her Di&s;quiets; at lea&s;t under the Protection of &s;uch a one, &s;he may; as many others do, enjoy all the conve|nient Privacy, without any of the Confinement or Severities of a Mona&s;tick Retirement.</P>

<P>THERE is no Con&s;ideration of more Mo|ment, or which more re&s;pects the pre&s;ent or future Good of Mankind, than a &s;evere and nice Attention to the natural Bent, Genius or Di&s;po&s;ition of Children. 'Tis through a Neg|lect of this, that we &s;ee &s;o many Profe&s;&s;ions, Functions and Vocations &s;o ill executed and &s;upplied. I have often preached this to Major <HI>Matchlock,</HI> who him&s;elf had been an <HI>Oliverian,</HI> and could neither write nor read, and but &s;cur|vily &s;et his Mark. His Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his Want of Learning made him run mad upon making his Son a Scholar. The Lad, who had an hereditary and unalienable Dulne&s;s, was ut|terly incapable. Neverthele&s;s to the <HI>Charter-Hou&s;e</HI> he went, where after having been for Four Years under a good Di&s;cipline, he was (if po&s;&s;ible) more &s;tupified by Correction, and returned again, like a leaden Shilling, upon his father's Hands. Soon after, by my Advice, he

was put to a Banker in <HI>Lombard-&s;treet,</HI> is now a Common-Councilman, will &s;hortly be Depu|ty of the Ward, and may in Time bid fair for the Chair. This is one In&s;tance, and every one who reads this, cannot fail, from his own Knowledge, of recollecting many more. On the other Hand, a great Genius is &s;ometimes overlooked, and a Youth ty'd down to mean Applications by having a Mechanick to his Fa|ther, who&s;e natural Fire, and Greatne&s;s of Spi|rit, make frequent vigorous Attempts; by which he at length &s;allies from behind the Counter, breaks through his Indentures, quits his opprobrious Apron, and flouri&s;hes in Arts or Arms. We read, that <HI>Wol&s;ey</HI> was but the Son of a Butcher, his Servant, the great <HI>Crom|well,</HI> and who perhaps was as great a Man, the Son of a Black&s;mith. An eminent Per&s;on of la|ter Times was reproached by one of better Birth, though of meaner Parts, for having for|merly been a Carrier. His An&s;wer, for his Temper and excellent Judgment in it, is not to be forgotten, which was, <Q REND="inline">"That if he who re|proach'd him had once been a Carrier, he would have been a Carrier &s;till."</Q> To de&s;cend yet to a more modern In&s;tance, my Friend <HI>U|riah Pattern,</HI> by Profe&s;&s;ion a Sale&s;man in the <HI>Strand,</HI> who &s;old me my la&s;t Purple Bays Gown, has a Son whom he bound to him&s;elf, that he might learn to make Clothes; but he, it &s;eems, was only born to wear 'em. I cannot &s;ay that he appears addicted by Nature either to Arts or Arms, being of the Beau Species, and giving daily Indications of a Smart Fellow. The Symptoms broke out early upon him, in red Heels, wrought Clocks, Agate-headed Canes, Li&s;pings, Patches, Contortions in Bow|ing, Oaths, Shrugs, Smiles, white Gloves, with a perpetual Propen&s;ity of &s;tretching out his
<PB N="84" REF="87">
Hand to lead Ladies, not only from his Fa|ther's Door, but from Pews, Pit, Box, or Galle|ry. It was al&s;o ob&s;ervable of him, that when up|on any Emergency he was forced to attend the Shop, he handled his Ell, and unrolled the Callicoes, with a particular Air of Scorn, Re|gret and Indignation. What the Cata&s;trophe of this Character will be I am loth to deter|mine, but there &s;eems to be &s;ome pre&s;ent Ma|lignancy in his Stars. His Mother, good Wo|man, came to me the other Day with Tears in her Eyes, and told me, that on the 6th of <HI>Fe|bruary</HI> la&s;t he went out, to all Appearance, well in the Morning. He had indeed di&s;gui|&s;ed him&s;elf in a rich Suit, by Means of which he was as much ob&s;erved, as he was unknown, at Court; that he returned very late at Night, extremely di&s;ordered, and has rav'd ever &s;ince. His Imagination being fill'd with the Idea's of what he &s;aw there, he frequently breaks out in Exclamations on Ba&s;&s;et, Drawing-Room, Balls, Rigadoons, Minuets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He talks of Dut|che&s;&s;es, Counte&s;&s;es, and Yeomen of the Guard. A poor Country Woman call'd in to buy a Yard of Flannel, and he cry'd, Stand by. A Servant Maid came ju&s;t afterwards for a Callicoe Gown and Petticoat: Asking him how much would &s;erve, he told her, &s;he mu&s;t take &s;o many Yards extraordinary, for he pre&s;umed &s;he would have it with a Train; then offered to lead her to her Pattins, which &s;he had put off at the Door, and wi&s;h'd her Grace a good Night.</P>

<P>MY Landlady has a little Boy about Five Years old, with who&s;e Conver&s;ation I often divert my &s;elf when I have taken my af|ternoon's Nap. I was ye&s;terday, with my Spectacles on, cutting out for him the Fi|gures of Kings, Milk-Maids, Trees, and the
<PB N="87" REF="90">
like, in Paper. We happen'd to be in warm Debate upon &s;ome important Circum&s;tance in our Bu&s;ine&s;s, when <HI>Will Moody</HI> came into my Room, and &s;eemed to wonder how a Per&s;on of my Age and Gravity could de&s;cend to &s;uch Trifles. He made me &s;o tedious a Vi&s;it, and was &s;o very di&s;agreeable in it, that I long'd till he was gone, and young Ma&s;ter and my &s;elf had re&s;umed our Entertainment, having a King to fini&s;h, who wanted only his Crown and a Pair of Hands. I have &s;ince reflected with &s;ome Contempt on tho&s;e who think that Wi&s;dom con&s;i&s;ts in a con&s;tant Tenor of Gra|vity, and that they can never put off their Se|riou&s;ne&s;s without breaking into their Cha|racter. How ill Judges &s;uch People are of hu|mane Nature may be determined, not only from the Opinions of Poets and Philo&s;ophers, but from the Practice of the wi&s;e&s;t and greate&s;t Men. <HI>Socrates,</HI> who, I think, may be recko|ned in the fir&s;t Rank of Mankind, was at Four&s;core taken by &s;ome of his Scholars in the Fact, Whi&s;tling and Dancing by him&s;elf. <HI>Scipio</HI> and <HI>Laelius</HI> u&s;ed to amu&s;e them&s;elves with ga|thering Shells on the Sea-Shore, and <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> to play at Cobnut with &s;ome favourite Boys.</P>
<P>As all Exerci&s;e, whether of Body or Mind, requires &s;ome Relaxation, &s;o we may ob&s;erve a Sort of Analogy or Agreement between Men's &s;everal Employments, and the Amu&s;ements they fall into. Thus the Labourer, after the Toil of the Day, refre&s;hes him&s;elf in the Eve|ning with Wre&s;tling, Dancing, or flinging the Bar: The dull Plodders in Bu&s;ine&s;s, as &s;oon as they are di&s;ingaged from it, fall in&s;en&s;ibly a&s;leep, or doze over a Pint: Men of great Ge|nius naturally fall into the&s;e Trifles which, at the &s;ame Time that they give Ea&s;e and Re|&s;pite to the Faculties, &s;erve to enliven in &s;ome
<PB N="88" REF="91">
Degree, and keep them in a gentle Motion. This I take to have been the Ea&s;e of tho&s;e great Men who&s;e Examples I have produced; and I am &s;o far gone in this Opinion, that I be|lieve every Per&s;on under&s;tands the Art of Tri|fling agreeably, in Proportion to his Share of Wit and good Sen&s;e; tho&s;e who are defective in either, being as incapable of doing it them|&s;elves as of reli&s;hing it in others. The only In|convenience is, when Men in great or grave Stations are not cautious enough to di&s;tingui&s;h before whom they give them&s;elves a Liberty this Way.</P>
<P><HI>Will Moody,</HI> among&s;t many others, has fur|ni&s;hed me with this Ob&s;ervation. After much formal Advice again&s;t doing Things un&s;uitable to my Age, and telling me how much it would have reflected upon me if any but a Friend had come in, he added, That he was mightily &s;hocked &s;ome Time ago by a Per&s;on of Repu|tation for Learning and Virtue, that had enter|tained him for half an Hour together with the Particularities of a Puppet-Show, which he carried his little Grand&s;on to &s;ee the Night be|fore. The Truth is, &s;uch &s;ow and groveling Spirits as the&s;e have &s;ome Rea&s;on for their Cen&s;ure, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing no good Qualities able to gain or to rai&s;e E&s;teem, &s;hould not pre&s;ume to act a Part that would &s;erve only to make 'em ridiculous. A Man who hopes to e&s;tabli&s;h his Character and Fortune by the Solemnity of his Countenance, would be in the Wrong to part with it upon every &s;light Occa&s;ion. Should he once deviate from the Road he is in, he knows not where it might end, nor how to recover his Mi&s;take. Even a Smile might be of dan|gerous Con&s;equence, and therefore he arms him&s;elf with an impregnable Gravity again&s;t all the Fooleries and Gaieties that may happen in his Way.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="92">
<HI>Democritulus</HI> is equally a Coxcomb, though of a very different Mould. He laughs for Laughing's Sake in the wrong Place, and is a Trifler upon all Occa&s;ions. In Pur&s;uit of this Humour, he regards neither Time, Per&s;on, nor Circum&s;tance, but lays about him without Di&s;tinction, and is a Kind of <HI>Drawcan&s;ir</HI> in Conver&s;ation. His neare&s;t Acquaintance, and their tendere&s;t Concerns, are the Subjects of his Wit and Ridicule; and he &s;eems to value him&s;elf for nothing more, than for having got the better of Mode&s;ty, good Manners, and Humanity. How an Inclination to Raillery may betray one into Offences of this Kind, I mu&s;t produce my &s;elf as an In&s;tance; and as the following Letter has awakened in me a Sen&s;e of my Error, my Willingne&s;s to in&s;ert it here, will, I hope, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure atone for it.</P>

<P>THE Relation between Ma&s;ters and their Servants, would, if rightly improved, contribute a great deal to the Happine&s;s of both. <HI>Seneca</HI> places the latter in a lower Rank of Friends, and imputes the vile and abject Treat|ment they u&s;ually meet with, to the Pride or Ignorance of tho&s;e who have the Power in their Hands. For my own Part, I have ever had a Kind of Tenderne&s;s and Regard for the few I have entertained in my Service: I have at proper Times be&s;towed &s;uitable Advice up|on them, and to the be&s;t of my Power impro|ved both their Morals and Under&s;tanding. By this Means they have gradually commenced
<PB N="92" REF="95">
humble Companions, and &s;erved to amu&s;e me with a Kind of low Conver&s;ation, at the &s;ame Time that they were doing the little nece&s;&s;ary Offices about my Per&s;on. My Maid, who is now turned of Fifty, is of &s;ingular U&s;e in this Way: As &s;he is warming my Bed, &s;he tells me a Hundred Stories of Spirits without Heads, black Dogs, and &s;everal Kinds of Apparitions, that have for <HI>&s;arten</HI> been &s;een in the Pari&s;h where &s;he was born. In a Morning, when &s;he brings me my Candle, &s;he acquaints me how the World goes, and entertains me with her &s;imple Remarks on the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Men, and mo&s;t important Affairs in it. This is ma|king the mo&s;t of her Capacity: But <HI>Pacolet,</HI> my other Servant, was a much greater Genius, and adorn'd with many excellent Qualities the high Station of <HI>Premiere Mini&s;tre</HI> to the Cen&s;or of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>As the Publick has been frequently obliged to his Intelligence for the Detection of &s;everal &s;ecret Enormities, I cannot think it improper to give &s;ome Account of him here, of his Ab|&s;ence for Six Months pa&s;t, and his late Return to the&s;e Parts. About the latter End of <HI>Au|gu&s;t</HI> la&s;t he came to me, and after talking over &s;ome Affairs I had employed him in, he told me in &s;hort, he was grown weary of acting al|together within the narrow Limits of this Kingdom, that if I would plea&s;e to allow him a Salary, and &s;end him abroad with a Cha|racter, he would in a &s;hort Time vi&s;it all the Courts of <HI>Europe,</HI> and bring from thence ma|ny Secrets and Curio&s;ities worthy of my Know|ledge and Acceptance. My Corre&s;pondents being numerous, and the Accounts they &s;ent me very faithful and material, I could the bet|ter &s;pare <HI>Pacolet</HI> at that Time. Accordingly, Mr. <HI>Lillie</HI> prepared his Credentials, in which
<PB N="93" REF="96">
he was &s;tiled <HI>Legate a Latere</HI> from <HI>I&s;aac Bic|ker&s;taff</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> A&s;trologer, Student in Phy&s;ick, and Cen&s;or of the Kingdom of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> He &s;et out &s;oon after, and having made the pro|mi&s;ed Tour with an Expedition peculiar to his Way of Travelling, he arrived again at <HI>Sheer-Lane</HI> (from whence he was directed to <HI>Chan|nel-Row</HI>) the 22d In&s;tant. I received him with much Plea&s;ure, together with the many Pre|&s;ents, Letters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> he brought me from Con|noi&s;&s;eurs, Great Princes, and Writers of Alma|nacks. I find by him that my Predictions fir&s;t introduced me to their Knowledge, and laid a Foundation for the Fame of my &s;ucceeding Lu|cubrations. He was, it &s;eems, particularly well received in the <HI>North;</HI> the contending Powers in tho&s;e Parts alternately per&s;wading him to declare in my Name for their Intere&s;t; which he prudently declined, alledging for his Excu&s;e, that he had particular In&s;tructions from the Cen&s;or, his Ma&s;ter, not to meddle in tho&s;e Affairs. Among&s;t other Things, he produc'd from his Portmanteau Two large Fo|lio's, each of which, he told me, contained an Account of his Travels, the &s;ame in Sub&s;tance, but differing in Style and the Manner of Wri|ting. He added, <Q REND="inline">"That which I approved &s;hould have the Preference, and &s;hortly be made ready for the Pre&s;s."</Q> In the fir&s;t Place therefore he read as follows: <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 22. 1710. This Morning, having taken Leave of my Ma&s;ter, I mounted my Flying-Hor&s;e at the lower End of <HI>Sheer-Lane,</HI> and without ob&s;erving much the Roads I pa&s;&s;ed over, &s;oon arrived at <HI>Am&s;terdam.</HI> I baited there at the <HI>Cat and Fiddle,</HI> and after ki&s;&s;ing my Lan|lady's Daughter in the Cellar, proceeded on my Journey to the Court of <HI>Vienna,</HI> which I reached about Noon the &s;ame Day."</Q> Very

Time took my &s;everal Degrees in Conver&s;a|tion. At fir&s;t &s;etting out, it was my con&s;tant Rule to pay a Deference to as many as had any Pretence to it, to &s;mile mode&s;tly when they were plea&s;ed to be facetious, and often &s;tand their Raillery, without offering to return it. It was not without &s;ome Difficulty that I got this Ma&s;tery of my &s;elf, in Spight of which, towards the latter End of an Evening, I now and then made an imprudent Sally, and endea|voured to be as &s;prightly as my Betters; but as it happened, I never &s;aid a good Thing over Night that was invidiou&s;ly remember'd the next Morning: The Truth is, the Smallne&s;s of my Fortune laid &s;ome Re&s;traint upon my Ge|nius. I &s;eldom rightly enjoyed my &s;elf till the Reckoning was paid, and by this Means my Gaiety begun when that of other People was at an End. At length, by an habitual Dulne&s;s, and other innocent Arts in my Behaviour, I worked my &s;elf into the E&s;teem of my Ac|quaintance, and in &s;omething more than four Years was allowed to be one of the Company. Then it was that I began to exert my Talents, and by a&s;&s;uming every Day more and more, at length e&s;tabli&s;hed an indi&s;putable Authority in the World. Though the Impatience and Fire of Youth may &s;ugge&s;t otherwi&s;e, the&s;e are certainly the Steps that lead &s;afely to con&s;um|mate Greatne&s;s, in whatever Form or Profe&s;&s;ion we a&s;pire after it.</P>
<P>I am indeed of Opinion, that &s;ome Years of our Lives are in a Manner thrown away and lo&s;t by Means of a wrong Education; which nothing has more effectually convinced me of, than the great and early Improvements that my Friend <HI>Sam Tru&s;ty</HI>'s Nephew, mentioned in one of my former Papers, has made under the particular Care and Direction of his Uncle:

and in cro&s;&s;ing our mo&s;t rea&s;onable De&s;ires and Inclinations. This Abu&s;e reigns chiefly in the Country, as I found to my Vexation, when I was la&s;t there, in a Vi&s;it I made to a Neigh|bour about Two Miles from my Cou&s;in. As &s;oon as I enter'd the Parlour, they forced me into the great Chair that &s;tood clo&s;e by a huge Fire, and kept me there by Force till I was al|mo&s;t &s;tifled. Then a Boy came in great Hurry to pull off my Boots, which I in vain oppo&s;ed, urging that I mu&s;t return &s;oon after Dinner. In the mean Time the good Lady whi&s;pered her elde&s;t Daughter, and &s;lipped a Key into her Hand. She returned in&s;tantly with a Beer Gla&s;s half full of <HI>Aqua Mirabilis</HI> and Syrrup of Gillyflowers. I took as much as I had a Mind for, but Madam vowed I &s;hould drink it off, (for &s;he was &s;ure it would do me Good after coming out of the cold Air) and I was forced to obey, which ab&s;olutely took away my Sto|mach. When Dinner came in, I had a Mind to &s;it at a Di&s;tance from the Fire; but they told me, it was as much as my Life was worth, and &s;et me with my Back ju&s;t again&s;t it. Tho' my Appetite was quite gone, I re&s;olved to force down as much as I could, and de&s;ired the Leg of a Pullet. Indeed, Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff,</HI> &s;ays the Lady, you mu&s;t eat a Wing to oblige me, and &s;o put a Couple upon my Plate. I was per&s;ecuted at this Rate during the whole Meal. As often as I called for Small Beer, the Ma&s;ter tipped the Wink, and the Servant brought me a Brimmer of <HI>October.</HI> Some Time after Din|ner I ordered my Cou&s;in's Man who came with me to get ready the Hor&s;es; but it was re&s;ol|ved I &s;hould not &s;tir that Night; and when I &s;eemed pretty much bent upon going, they or|dered the Stable Door to be locked, and the Children hid away my Cloak and Boots. The

As &s;oon as her Back was turned, the little Mi&s;&s;es ran backwards and forwards every Moment, and con&s;tantly as they came in or went out, made a Courtefie directly at me, which in good Manners I was forced to return with a Bow, and, <HI>Your humble Servant pretty Mi&s;s.</HI> Exactly at Eight the Mo|ther came up, and di&s;covered by the Redne&s;s of her Face that Supper was not far off. It was twice as large as the Dinner, and my Per|&s;ecution doubled in Proportion. I de&s;ired at my u&s;ual Hour to go to my Repo&s;e, and was conducted to my Chamber by the Gentleman, his Lady, and the whole Train of Children. They importuned me to drink &s;omething be|fore I went to Bed, and upon my refu&s;ing, at la&s;t left a Bottle of <HI>Stingo,</HI> as they called it, for Fear I &s;hould wake and be thir&s;ty in the Night. I was forced in the Morning to ri&s;e and dre&s;s my &s;elf in the Dark, becau&s;e they would not &s;uffer my Kin&s;man's Servant to di&s;turb me at the Hour I had de&s;ired to be called. I was now re&s;olved to break through all Mea&s;ures to get away, and after &s;itting down to a mon|&s;trous Breakfa&s;t of cold Beef, Mutton, Neats Tongues, Veni&s;on Pa&s;ty, and Stale Beer, took Leave of the Family; but the Gentleman would

needs &s;ee me Part of my Way, and carry me a &s;hort Cut through his own Grounds, which, he told me, would &s;ave half a Mile's Riding. This la&s;t Piece of Civility had like to have co&s;t me dear, being once or twice in Danger of my Neck, by leaping over his Ditches, and at la&s;t forced to alight in the Dirt, when my Hor&s;e, having &s;lip'd his Bridle, ran away, and took us up more than an Hour to recover him a|gain.</P>
<P>It is evident that none of the Ab&s;urdities I met with in this Vi&s;it proceeded from an ill Intention, but from a wrong Judgment of Complai&s;ance, and a Mi&s;application of the Rules of it. I cannot &s;o ea&s;ily excu&s;e the more refined Criticks upon Behaviour, who having profe&s;&s;ed no other Study, are yet infinitely de|fective in the mo&s;t material Parts of it. <HI>Ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> Fa&s;hion</HI> has been bred all his Life about Court, and under&s;tands to a Tittle all the Punctilio's of a Drawing-Room.

To Mr. <HI>I&s;aac</HI> he owes an ea&s;ie Slide in his Bow, and a graceful Manner of coming into a Room. But in &s;ome other Ca&s;es he is very far from being a well|bred Per&s;on: He laughs at Men of far &s;uperior Under&s;tanding to his own, for not being as well dre&s;&s;ed as him&s;elf, de&s;pi&s;es all his Ac|quaintance that are not Quality, and in publick Places has on that Account often avoided ta|king Notice of &s;ome of the be&s;t Speakers in the Hou&s;e of Commons. He rails &s;trenuou&s;ly at both Univer&s;ities before the Members of either, and never is heard to &s;wear an Oath, or break in upon Morality or Religion, but in the Com|pany of Divines. On the other Hand, a Man of right Sen&s;e has all the E&s;&s;entials of good

Hence it is, that he gives no Offence, that he conver&s;es with great Deference, Candor, and Humanity. His Bow, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, is &s;ome|what aukward; but then he has an exten&s;ive, univer&s;al, and unaffected Knowledge, which makes &s;ome Amends for it.

<P>THE Concern I have for the Errors of Mankind in general, does &s;en&s;ibly abate or increa&s;e in Proportion to the Rank and Quality of tho&s;e who fall under my Ob&s;ervation. For this Rea&s;on I can never &s;uffer a Coronet to pa&s;s me without enquiring whom it belongs to, and whether it be worn in a Manner &s;uitable to &s;o honourable a Di&s;tinction. I can &s;ay with a great deal of Truth, that I am commonly an|&s;wered to my Satisfaction: When it happens otherwi&s;e, I carry my Enquiry yet further, and inform my &s;elf with the greate&s;t Exactne&s;s ima|ginable, whether the Misfortune of Complexion, or that of Education, has chiefly contributed to eclip&s;e the Lu&s;tre, and defeat the Advantages, of a high and noble De&s;cent. Many Failures I find chargeable on the former, but they are not &s;o numerous, nor of &s;o dangerous a Nature, as
<PB N="108" REF="111">
tho&s;e which re&s;ult from the latter, being only &s;uch Tendencies of the Mind as, by early Care and proper Application, might have been culti|vated and improved into u&s;eful and generous Qualifications. It is therefore of the la&s;t Impor|tance, as well to the future Happine&s;s of our young Nobility, as to that of a Nation in great Mea&s;ure depending on them; that their Genius &s;hould be nicely ob&s;erved, their Capacity im|proved, and a right Turn given to their Under|&s;tanding. To effect this, I have &s;ometimes had it in my Head to write a Treati&s;e with Dire|ctions to Tutors or Governors in the Di&s;charge of &s;o weighty an Employment; but being cre|dibly informed that they were a Sort of People who had little Opinion of any Body's Wi&s;dom but their own, I was di&s;couraged from that Undertaking, and obliged to pur&s;ue other Mea&s;ures. I have within this Twelvemonth made a Coffee-hou&s;e Acquaintance with as ma|ny of them as I could, and now and then over a Di&s;h of Tea enquired into the Schemes and Methods they have laid down for the Manage|ment of their Pupils. The fir&s;t I happened up|on, is a grave, &s;ober, and di&s;creet Per&s;on, turn|ed of Fifty, his Countenance &s;omewhat formi|dable, and his Conver&s;ation extremely rigid and &s;evere. He has by &s;ome Means or other &s;een the Out&s;ides of mo&s;t of the Courts in <HI>Eu|rope,</HI> and got a Smattering in the Languages; but having no Ta&s;te of polite Learning, nor a|ny In&s;ight into humane Nature, he is much better qualified to wait in an Ante-room, or keep the Accounts of the Family he belongs to, than to conduct the Hopes of it into the World. He has often told me with great Pride and Sa|tisfaction, <Q REND="inline">"That he has his young Lord in as much Subjection as a Footboy, That he of
<PB N="109" REF="112">
Cour&s;e denies him every Thing he has a Mind to, and that in the Mid&s;t of his Diver|&s;ion he can make him tremble with a Frown."</Q> Such is the Love of Tyranny in mean and nar|row Spirits, even in the lowe&s;t Circum&s;tance of Power. Another of them &s;ets up for a fine Gentleman, and is a Pedant in taking Pains to be otherwi&s;e. He has a Notion that Letters are but a poor Accompli&s;hment for a Man of Quality, that a good Air, and being furiou&s;ly of a Party, are &s;ufficient Di&s;tinctions for one that is born to many others; and therefore in|dulges the Youth under his Care in an immo|derate Love of Dogs, Hor&s;es, Plays, Gallantry, and all Manner of Entertainments. At Lei|&s;ure Hours he flatters him with an Opinion of his Superiority to the common Level of Mankind, and &s;trictly cautions him again&s;t entertaining the lea&s;t Regard for the Scum and Dregs of the People. What a Patriot, Hero, and Coun&s;ellor, may we hope for from &s;o extraordinary an Education! A Third, whom I &s;uffer indeed to vi&s;it me now and then, &s;eems to have a better Sen&s;e of his Duty in this Station than either of the others. Knowing that I am a great Lover of Chil|dren, he one Day brought his Pupil, who is very young, to my Lodgings. He had long promi&s;ed him, I found, that he would carry him to wait upon Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff;</HI> and I do not remember, that I was ever &s;o well plea&s;ed with being pointed at in Publick, as I was with the particular Survey this little Boy took of me. After this Curio&s;ity was pretty well over, he &s;eemed willing to enter into Conver&s;ation, in which he acquitted him&s;elf with the utmo&s;t good Manners, and a manly Turn of Wit very di&s;proportioned to his Years. I could perceive
<PB N="110" REF="113">
he had a great Mind to be talking of the <HI>Tat|lers,</HI> and I on Purpo&s;e led him into it. He made &s;ome very &s;urpri&s;ing Remarks upon &s;everal of them, and with an agreeable Freedom ask'd me the Meaning of others that he did not under|&s;tand. I begged his little Lord&s;hip to accept of the Volumes I had by me, and in Return he de&s;ired my Leave to be a Sub&s;criber for the next. Ever now and then I had my Eye upon his Tutor, and could perceive in him an inex|pre&s;&s;ible Plea&s;ure for the good Behaviour of his Charge.</P>
<P>I could not help taking him a&s;ide &s;oon after, and telling him, that I almo&s;t envy'd him the Happine&s;s of having &s;o fine a Genius in his Hands: <Q REND="inline">"Go on Sir, &s;ays I, to cultivate and improve it, and by that Means be an In&s;tru|ment of publick Good to your Country. You will never, perhaps, have it in your Power to act in a more meritorious Capacity. Think only what a Plea&s;ure it will be to you, to &s;ee this young Gentleman hereafter at the Head of an Army, or managing a Debate in the mo&s;t illu&s;trious A&s;&s;embly in the World. Be|lieve me, you will in a great Mea&s;ure partake his Glory, and act as it were by Proxy in whatever Station his Merit &s;hall advance him to If I can form any Judgment of him at the&s;e Years, you will from his future Grati|tude and E&s;teem receive the Fruits of the ut|mo&s;t Pains you can be&s;tow upon him. He will con&s;ider you almo&s;t in the highe&s;t Rela|tion, and next to the Per&s;ons that gave him Life, will love and honour one that pointed out to him the U&s;e and End of his Being.'</Q></P>

<P>THough I &s;eldom eat out of my own Lodg|ings, I was prevailed on the other Day to dine with &s;ome Friends at the <HI>Rummer</HI> in <HI>Queen-&s;treet.</HI> A Phy&s;ician, who was engaged to be of the Party, &s;taying &s;omewhat beyond the Time, <HI>Sam Tru&s;ty</HI> would needs have me go with him into the Kitchen, and &s;ee how Mat|ters went there.

<P>THE Dignity and Di&s;tinction of Men of Wit is &s;eldom enough con&s;idered, either by them&s;elves or others; their own Behaviour, and the U&s;age they meet with, being generally very much of a Piece.

I know a certain Lord that has often invited a Set of People, and pro|po&s;ed for their Diver&s;ion a Buffoon Player, and an eminent Poet, to be of the Party; and which was yet wor&s;e, thought them both &s;ufficiently recompenced by the Dinner, and the Honour of his Company. This Kind of In&s;olence is ri&s;en to &s;uch a Height, that I my &s;elf was the other Day &s;ent to by a Man with a Title, whom I had never &s;een, de&s;iring the Fa|vour that I would dine with him and half a Dozen of his &s;elect Friends.

Young Students coming up to Town from the Places of their Education, are dazzled with the Grandeur they every where meet, and making too much Ha&s;te to di&s;tin|gui&s;h their Parts, in&s;tead of waiting to be de&s;i|red

When <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth had mi&s;carried in his <HI>African</HI> Expedition, which was looked upon as the weake&s;t Undertaking of that great Empe|ror, he &s;ent <HI>Aretine</HI> a Gold Chain, who made &s;ome Difficulty of accepting it, &s;aying, <HI>It was too &s;mall a Pre&s;ent in all Rea&s;on for &s;o great a Folly.</HI> For my own Part, in this Point I differ from him, and never could be prevailed upon, by any valuable Con&s;ideration, to conceal a Fault or a Folly &s;ince I fir&s;t took the Cen&s;or|&s;hip upon me.</P>
<P>Having long con&s;idered with my &s;elf the ill Application that &s;ome make of their Talents, I have this Day erected a Court of <HI>Alienation,</HI> by the Statutes of which the next a Kin is im|powered to <HI>beg</HI> the Parts and Under&s;tanding of any &s;uch Per&s;on as can be proved, either by imbezelling, making a wrong U&s;e, or no U&s;e at all of the &s;aid Parts and Under&s;tanding, not to know the true Value thereof: Who &s;hall immediately be put out of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and di&s;|qualified for ever; the &s;aid Kin&s;man giving &s;ufficient Security that he will employ them as

No one &s;ure can be &s;o entirely a Stranger to the World of Literature, as not to be &s;en&s;ible of the many Abu&s;es that have lately crept into it, which, unle&s;s a &s;peedy and effectual Remedy were applied, would in Proce&s;s of Time bring no &s;mall Scandal on the mo&s;t refined Part of Man|kind, and end perhaps (which I tremble to think of) in the utter Extirpation of Let|ters among&s;t us.

<P>When this la&s;t Sentence was brought to me for my Confirmation, I very readily approved of it; and though I was aware that the Term of <HI>Huskanawing</HI> being a Word unknown in any of the Courts of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> it might &s;eem an Hard&s;hip upon a People jealous of their Rights and Liberties, to impo&s;e a new Sort of Puni&s;h|ment upon what has hitherto been &s;carce ac|counted a Crime: Neverthele&s;s, out of the Plenitude of my Power, and of my own meer Motion and certain Science, I do ratify and confirm the &s;aid Sentence.

extend the Prerogative of Cen&s;or of <HI>Great Britain</HI> to any unrea&s;onable Bounds, nor u&s;e it at all, but for the Good of the People; &s;o for the Quieting of their Minds from any Doubts which might ari&s;e concerning this new Word, I have thought it convenient to explain to them what it means.</P>
<P>It is a Cu&s;tom among&s;t the <HI>We&s;t-Indians</HI> that border upon <HI>Virginia,</HI> for the Prie&s;ts of the Country to elect a certain Number of the hope|fule&s;t young Men, and of the be&s;t Families, to make the Operation of <HI>Huskanawing</HI> upon. When they have gather'd together Thirty or Forty of 'em they retire with them into the mo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible Parts of the Woods, where they build a large Stove, in which they &s;weat the young Men. They keep 'em to a very &s;trange Diet, and their Drink is an odd Com|po&s;ition of <HI>Indian</HI> Corn, and Juices of poi&s;o|nous Herbs, which has &s;uch an Effect upon them, that they lo&s;e their Hair, their Nails, their Skins, and half of them their Lives, be|fore the Proce&s;s be half over. They that have Strength enough to hold out till Thirty Days, are brought Home in great Triumph, and the&s;e are looked on as the Top Patriots of that Coun|try. This &s;eems to me to be a very wi&s;e In&s;ti|tution, and fit to be introduced in my own Country; for the Sweatings, Diet, Drugs and Drink which they have been u&s;ed to, quite re|novate the Men, &s;o that they come out without any Remembrance of their Parents, Country, Loves, Language, or even of their own Names. The&s;e are their Heroes, the&s;e their Coun&s;ellors, the&s;e their Amba&s;&s;adors, the&s;e have the Ma|nagement of all their Publick Affairs, and are maintained at the Publick Charge. I mu&s;t not omit, that 'tis almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould, after this Operation, retain any Regard for

their former Studies, or in the lea&s;t de&s;ire to return to them: If they &s;hould, they dur&s;t not own it, for Fear of being taken and <HI>Re|huskanaw'd.</HI></P>

<P>A Writer who has the World under his Di|rection, cannot better employ his Intere&s;t and Authority, than in cultivating a good Cor|re&s;pondence between Men, and endeavouring to make them agreeable to each other. Not|with&s;tanding the Pains I have taken this Way. I have Rea&s;on, from an Accident I met with, to believe I have not yet throughly effected &s;o great and nece&s;&s;ary a Work. Walking the Streets this Morning, I met a Gentleman of my Acquaintance who has the Honour to &s;erve his Country in a very u&s;eful Capacity. <HI>Oh Mr.</HI> Bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">|ker&s;taff, &s;ays he, <HI>you are luckily met; I w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> your Advice upon a very extraordinary Occa&s;ion. You may command me,</HI> an&s;wered I, <HI>to the be&s;t of my Under&s;tanding; but 'tis a Rule with me, nei|ther to talk nor look wi&s;ely in the Street. Plea&s;e</HI>

<HI>only to walk into the next Coffee-hou&s;e&mdash;By no Means, Sir,</HI> replied he, <HI>&s;tarting back<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> don't you know that &s;ome of the ranke&s;t&mdash;in</HI> Great Britain <HI>come thither?&mdash;Not I in good Truth, Sir; but if they do, I &s;uppo&s;e there may be Room for us&mdash;Ay marry,</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>and &s;o there may be in the Dens at the</HI> Tower; <HI>for my Part I would as &s;oon venture into one as the other.</HI> I immediately laughed out in his Face; upon which he turned away in great Indignation, and left me to reflect on &s;o extra|ordinary a Behaviour.</P>
<P>I went on, and having a Curio&s;ity to &s;ee the&s;e &s;trange Creatures my Friend had &s;poke of, called in at the Place before-mentioned. I was indeed &s;urprized at my Entrance to ob|&s;erve the Eyes of the whole Herd turned upon me, a full Stop put to their Conver&s;ation, and their Di&s;hes for &s;ome Time &s;u&s;pended in Mid-Air at a little Di&s;tance from their Lips. Turn|ing to the Gentleman at the Bar, I asked in a &s;oft Tone for a Di&s;h of Tea. <HI>There is none made,</HI> &s;aid he, in a very &s;urly Man|ner&mdash;<HI>Pray then will you help me to a Di&s;h of your Coffee?&mdash;You mu&s;t &s;tay till it is &s;ettled,</HI> re|plied he, <HI>if you will have any</HI>&mdash;I did &s;o, and called for the <HI>Tatler</HI>&mdash;A pert Boy looked in my Face, and told me, <HI>They did not take it in &s;ince it had left off la&s;hing the Party; I might have the</HI> Review, Ob&s;ervator, <HI>or the</HI> Spectator, <HI>if I plea&s;ed</HI>&mdash;In the mean Time the grave People round the Fire had a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ittle recovered their Confu&s;ion, and by their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">hi&s;pering to each other, and then &s;taring at me, gave me to under&s;tand that I was looked upon as a Spy, or at lea&s;t an In|truder into &s;elect Company. One of them, more bold than the re&s;t, &s;eemed prepared to &s;peak to me, and collected him&s;elf in a re&s;o|lute

Po&s;ture in order to it; but his Courage <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">iling, he &s;unk down into his Chair again, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">d &s;uffered me to pa&s;s unmole&s;ted to a Seat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ext the Chimney. A &s;urly-looking Fellow, who &s;eemed to be one of tho&s;e who do not care a Farthing for any Body, &s;ate oppo&s;ite to me, and fixing his Eyes &s;tedfa&s;tly upon me, threw out Three or Four of his main Principles in a Breath, expecting, as I &s;uppo|&s;ed, either my Di&s;like or Approbation of them. A young Gentleman next him, who, I ob&s;erved, filled his Pipe, and reached the Tobacco-Tongs for him, a&s;&s;ented with a Smile to what he &s;aid, and could not but wonder, <HI>that any Per&s;on &s;hould be &s;o propo&s;terous as to think otherwi&s;e, or &s;o in&s;ipid as to conceal his Thoughts if he did.</HI></P>
<P>The Calmne&s;s and invincible Silence with which I received all this Raillery, had like to have brought me into &s;ome Peril; for in le&s;s than a Quarter of an Hour the whole Fire-&s;ide was up in a Pa&s;&s;ion: Upon which I ro&s;e deli|berately from my Chair, laid a Couple of Pence without Noi&s;e upon the Bar, and &s;tole out in the &s;ame State of Neutrality that I came in. I take it for granted, if I had fol|lowed my Friend to a Coffee-hou&s;e of his chu|&s;ing, I &s;hould have met with the &s;ame Treat|ment, only &s;oftened a little perhaps by the lucky Circum&s;tance of being introduced by one of the &s;ame Society.</P>
<P>A Humour &s;o ab&s;urd needs not any Anim|adver&s;ions. Follies of this Stamp are too glaring in their own Nature to &s;uffer any Sa|tyr or Illu&s;tration upon them; to which, with &s;ome Alteration, may be applied tho&s;e excel|lent Lines:<Q><PB N="134" REF="137">

<P>In like Manner the Embelli&s;hments of Ridi|cule are thrown away in Ca&s;es where a plain Narration does more effectually &s;erve the Ends propo&s;ed by it.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not omit mentioning a good whim|fical Bu&s;ine&s;s that I accidentally met with in this Adventure. The Boy of the Coffee-hou&s;e having put one or two of his politick Papers into my Hand, the Title of the <HI>Spectator,</HI> which I had never before &s;een or heard of, in|duced me to read it over in &s;uch a cur&s;ory Manner as that Kind of Writing requires. To|wards the End of the Paper, I found a Letter &s;ub&s;cribed <HI>C&mdash; L&mdash;.</HI> After peru&s;ing it, I could not without Tears in my Eyes con|&s;ider the deplorable Condition of this poor Man. The Ca&s;e of <HI>Ned Prattin,</HI> Sale&s;man, and that of this unfortunate Perfumer, bear &s;ome Re&s;emblance; and I have but too much Rea&s;on to fear will both terminate in the wretch|ed Circum&s;tances of <HI>Straw and a dark Room.</HI> Whether it be owing to the great Quantities of Snuff he has taken, or to Pride of Heart from the Encouragement I formerly gave him, it is certain that the latter has not for &s;ome Time been right in his Mind. His unaccount|able U&s;age of me when I went la&s;t into the Country, was the fir&s;t Sally of his Di&s;temper,
<PB N="135" REF="138">
which is now broke out into manife&s;t Phrenzy. However unwilling I am to expo&s;e him in &s;o publick a Manner, I mu&s;t hereby warn all Per&s;ons what&s;oever concerned about him not to tru&s;t a Penknife in his Hands, nor any In|&s;trument wherewith he may do him&s;elf or o|thers a Mi&s;chief; that his Maid do every Night take off his Garters, and remove them far out of his Reach; that he be not permitted to drink out of a Gla&s;s, le&s;t he &s;hould eat it; nor to feed on Fi&s;h, (although it be <HI>Lent</HI>) le&s;t he &s;hould indu&s;triou&s;ly choak him&s;elf with the Bones.</P>
<P>I would by no Means be mi&s;under&s;tood, as if what I here &s;ay were meant as any Reflection on Mr. <HI>Buckley</HI>'s Paper. Any Gentleman in his Way may in&s;ert &s;uch Letters as come fir&s;t to Hand, and I verily believe That I &s;peak of to be <HI>Charles</HI>'s own Writing.

<P>THE Humour of Duelling having lately very much obtained about Town, I have taken more than ordinary Pains to put a Stop to it. To this End, I have been obliged to ap|pear frequently at mo&s;t of the Gaming-hou&s;es, both the Theatres, and at Punch's Opera. At the latter of the&s;e Entertainments, notwith|&s;tanding my Pre&s;ence, there happened one Evening &s;ome Advances towards a Quarrel, when Punch, with great Re&s;olution of Body, coming forwards upon the Stage, ask'd the Gentlemen, <HI>If they were not a&s;hamed to commit &s;uch Di&s;orders before him&s;elf and the Cen&s;or of</HI> Great Britain; For which In&s;tance of Re&s;pect, I &s;hall ever honour and e&s;teem that incompa|rable Player.

<P>I Return you Thanks, in the Name of this Univer&s;ity, for your Town Eclogue, which we look upon to be a very extraordinary Piece of Ridicule. I am commi&s;&s;ioned to tell you at the &s;ame Time, that tho&s;e who were your Contemporaries knowing you to have a happy Talent in Poetry, it is expected you &s;hould oblige the World oftner in that Way: You &s;hall want no A&s;&s;i&s;tance this Place can afford. I am making a Collection of the be&s;t Ver&s;es that are &s;tirring for your Service. Mr. <HI>Y&mdash;g</HI> tells me, he has left his Poem, en|tituled, <HI>The La&s;t Day,</HI> in your Hands, to make what U&s;e of it you &s;hould think pro|per. There is in that excellent Work a Noble|ne&s;s of Thought, as well as Strength of Ex|pre&s;&s;ion, which I have not met with in any of our modern Writers. The &s;ame Gentle|man,

<P>It is natural for a Man who receives a Fa|vour of this Kind from an unknown Fair, to frame immediately &s;ome Idea of her Per&s;on which being &s;uited to the Opinion we have of our own Merit, is commonly as beautiful and perfect as the mo&s;t lavi&s;h Imagination can fur|ni&s;h out. Strongly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the&s;e No|tions, I have read over <HI>Sylvia</HI>'s Billet; and not|with&s;tanding the Re&s;erve I have had upon this Matter, am re&s;olved to go a much greater Length than I yet ever did in making my &s;elf known to the World, and in particular to my charming Corre&s;pondent.

This innocent Impo&s;ture, which I have all along taken Care to carry on as it then was of &s;ome U&s;e, has &s;ince been of &s;ingular Service to me, and by being mentioned in one of my Papers, effectually recovered my <HI>Egoiety</HI> out of the Hands of &s;ome Gentlemen who endeavoured to wre&s;t it from me.

<P>IT is certainly very unrea&s;onable that a Man, becau&s;e he has &s;ome Wit, &s;hould &s;et up for having more than all the re&s;t of the World. Be|&s;ides the Folly of &s;uch a Pre&s;umption, there is an Inconvenience which naturally attends it: When one Man &s;eems to grow into a great E&s;tate in Fame from Nothing, other People are apt to enquire into his Title.

<P>IT is in my Opinion no &s;mall Reflection on the Theatrical Entertainments of this Town, that the intermi&s;&s;ion of them &s;hould be looked upon as a Kind of negative Preparation to Du|ties of the la&s;t Importance. This amounts to a tacit Acknowledgment that they are, in ge|neral, calculated for our Diver&s;ion, without Re|gard to our Improvement; that they amu&s;e on|ly and unbend the Minds of an Audience, in|&s;tead of filling them with great and noble I|dea's; and &s;erve rather to &s;ink the Dignity of humane Nature, than to rai&s;e in us any ju&s;t Sentiments about it. Were it otherwi&s;e, the Stage would have good Rea&s;on to remon&s;trate again&s;t &s;o peculiar a Mark of Infamy, as that of being denied to the World at the Approach of any Religious Solemnity, and forced by that Means to confe&s;s an irreconcilable Enmity be|tween the Plea&s;ures of the one, and the Obli|gations of the other. Notwith&s;tanding all this, I confe&s;s, for my own Part, that I receive ma|ny Advantages from going to the Play-hou&s;e &s;ometimes. There is, be&s;ides the Play it &s;elf,
<PB N="159" REF="162">
&s;omething in the Circum&s;tances of &s;uch an A&s;|&s;embly, that gives me a new Turn of Think|ing, and furni&s;hes me with Ob&s;ervations out of the common Road. I have a Plea&s;ure more than I ever ob&s;erved in any one el&s;e on that Occa&s;ion, in &s;eeing &s;o great a Variety of Faces, as well beautiful as others, and in tracing their &s;everal Tempers, Humours and Opinions in their Looks, Air and Behaviour. To &s;it Three Hours in a Crowd, is in my Opinion a &s;evere Trial of a Man's Under&s;tanding, and from his Deportment there I can generally form a Judg|ment on his whole Life and Conver&s;ation. Among&s;t others, I have ever avoided making an Acquaintance with any Per&s;on of either Sex who talked loud, or laboured by any Means to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t of the Audience. My Friend <HI>Sam Tru&s;ty</HI> exceeds me in Penetra|tion. He and I commonly &s;it together, and be|tween the Acts entertain our &s;elves with read|ing over as many People as lie within our Kens. He enters not only into their Di&s;po&s;itions, but the minute&s;t Circum&s;tances of their Fortunes, can ca&s;t up their Monthly Accounts, knows how their Rooms are furni&s;hed, what they eat and drink; and in &s;hort, is at fir&s;t Sight of their Per&s;ons let into the Secrets of their re|&s;pective Families. In taking a Survey of the Front Boxes, we are from thence furni&s;hed with many &s;erious Speculations, whil&s;t the more youthful Part of the Company are enter|taining them&s;elves on the &s;ame Subject after a very different Manner. We examine coolly and without Danger the Symmetry and Pro|portion of a fine Face; and from the Bloom of a Complexion, are led perhaps into Reflections upon Light and Colours. We were engaged in a Conver&s;ation of this Sort &s;ome Evenings ago at the Opera, when <HI>Sam Tru&s;ty</HI> breaking

<P>I Cannot better &s;hew the Concern I have for the <HI>Belles Letters,</HI> than in making &s;uch a Provi&s;ion for tho&s;e who are turned that Way as may be&s;t conduce to their Proficiency in it. The different Sea&s;ons of the Year are proper for different Sorts of Performances, which I don't remember any of my Fellow-Labourers in A&s;trology to have ob&s;erved in their Yearly Almanacks. This indeed is a very gro&s;s Omi&s;|&s;ion; and I que&s;tion not, if Mr. <HI>Partridge</HI> were alive, but he would readily embrace the Hint, and hereafter improve upon it. Suppo&s;e, for In&s;tance, in a Work of this Kind one were to write <HI>Ob&s;ervations on</HI> April.<Q><P>This Month &s;ow Hemp and Flax, pole Hops, &s;et and &s;ow all Kind of Garden Herbs; re&s;tore the Liberty of the laborious Bee by opening her Hive, bark Trees for Tanners, and let good Hou&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ives mind their Gardens, and begin to think of their Dairies.</P></Q>

<L>In Gard'ning ne'er this Rule forget,</L>

<P>Subjoining afterwards:<Q>This Month al&s;o lay the Plots of Plays, and de|&s;ign the Models of Heroick Poems. Set and &s;ow the Seeds of all Kind of Poetry, re&s;tore the Liber|ty of the laborious Mu&s;e by opening her Common-Place Book. Cut out Work for the Book&s;ellers.

<P>Tho&s;e concerned in Pa&s;torals I have el&s;ewhere con&s;ider'd.

Being informed that the Town is di&s;appointed of an excellent Comedy by an ingenious Tra|der's employing his Stock another Way, I be|lieve I may put the Succe&s;s of the re&s;t of the Comick Writers into <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> Term without crowding them.</P>
<P>For the Summer Quarter, any one who has unfa&s;hionable Wares lying dead upon his Hands, as tawdry Panegyricks, or faded Sa|tyrs, which neither plea&s;e the pre&s;ent, nor hurt the pa&s;t Mini&s;try, is advi&s;ed to &s;eek out &s;ome Plantation or Colony of civil <HI>Indians,</HI> where perhaps they may barter them for Ale, Rum, and Tobacco; and if they &s;hould fail there, to proceed on a trading Voyage to the <HI>Bath,</HI> where, by altering the Names, without chang|ing the Sub&s;tance, their Goods will become Lampoons, and undergo a Fate rever&s;e to that of <HI>A&s;a Foetida,</HI> which &s;ets out a Perfume from <HI>Surat,</HI> and arrives a Stink at <HI>London.</HI> In one Place it is eat for Sawce, and in the other cures Hy&s;terick Fits.

<P>As I was meditating in this Way, I fell into a Sort of Enthu&s;ia&s;m: I &s;eemed to behold a Chariot, that had painted upon the Doors of it a Snake with the Tail in its Mouth, which being the Hieroglyphick of the Year, as well as the En&s;ign of the Divinity of Phy|&s;ick, I was at a Lo&s;s what to make of it. Till ob&s;erving it was <HI>corteged</HI> by broken Prin|ters and Apothecaries, I enquired who the Per&s;on was I &s;aw fitting in the Chariot, and what he could be writing. I was an&s;wered, That it was the Genius of Heroick Poetry, a

<P>I recovered this Delirium as the Bell-man went about with an annual Sort of Poetry, which I had like to have forgot, though I have for many Years with Joy ob&s;erved it to be a Fore-runner of Mince-Pies and Plum-Por|ridge.</P>

<P>HAving a great Honour for your Perfor|mances, I think it my Duty to acquaint you with the unworthy Treatment many of your Papers have lately met with. It is my Cu&s;tom in an Afternoon to &s;aunter from one Coffee-hou&s;e to another; and as I was the other Day thus rambling about, a Couple of odd Fellows enter'd the Room where I was; one of them in his own &s;hort black Hair, with an uncommon Smartne&s;s in his Face; the other a thin meagre Per&s;on, having much Hunger and Di&s;content in his Countenance. Whil&s;t the former of the&s;e engaged the Man of the Hou&s;e in a brisk Conver&s;ation, the latter, I ob&s;erved, &s;lip'd the <HI>Tatler</HI> into his

Pocket, and drop'd two <HI>Spectators</HI> in the Place of it, in order, as I &s;uppo&s;e, to &s;tifle the one, and introduce the other. They immediately afterwards went out, and upon following them in a carele&s;s Manner to three or four o|ther Hou&s;es, I found them putting the &s;ame Stratagem in Practice. At la&s;t I laid hold of one of them, and re&s;olved to bring him be|fore you, when giving a &s;udden Spring, he broke loo&s;e from me, and with his Accom|plice made the be&s;t of his Way up the next Alley.

<P>THE Extent of your Lucubrations being &s;uch, as to take in whatever may be &s;eriou&s;ly in&s;tructive, or innocently diverting, I pre&s;ume the following Relation may come within the Compa&s;s of them, and therefore venture to lay it before you as it accidentally occurred.</P>
<P>Happening to vi&s;it la&s;t Night an old Ac|quaintance, who&s;e Hours of Retirement have been &s;pent in uncommon Contemplations and Experiments, he &s;hewed me under a large Gla&s;s, Hermetically &s;ealed up, a &s;preading Plant, in its full Verdure, &s;trong and lively to
<PB N="174" REF="177">
the Eye, which he a&s;&s;ured me he had rai&s;ed from its own A&s;hes in a few Moments. This naturally led him to a Rational Di&s;cour&s;e on the Refurrection, which, though &s;uccinct, was managed with that Per&s;picuity, as to an|&s;wer to Demon&s;tration all the Objections brought again&s;t it by its mo&s;t formidable Op|ponents, tho&s;e perfect Ma&s;ters of Rea&s;on's and of Nature's Laws, though very imperfect Chri&s;tians, Morali&s;ts, or Men. But to return to the Plant: It bore the Figure of that <HI>In|dian</HI> Weed (if it be lawful to call it one) that more than half the World hold in &s;o great E&s;teem; and my Friend growing le&s;s &s;erious, de&s;ired, that (while I &s;moaked my Pipe) he might take <HI>Ae&s;op</HI>'s Liberty, and let the admi|red Vegetable give its own Hi&s;tory in the fol|lowing Words:</P>
<P>Our Extract is of ancienter Date than that of Mankind, flouri&s;hing in the World before the Days of <HI>Adam.</HI> Our Parents, tho' wide|ly di&s;tant from each other as Heaven and Earth, yet always kindly concurred in our Generation and Production, rai&s;ing us higher in their Favour than any of our Si&s;ter Plants. As our Birth was for many Ages &s;pontaneous, &s;o was our Life uncontrouled; and while we &s;aw our Neighbours devoured all by Rep|tiles, Brutes, or Men, our &s;elves &s;ecurely ranged the <HI>American</HI> Woods unexpo&s;ed to their voracious Appetites; for as we were Objects of their Love, &s;o neither were they of our Fears. How did the Sun each Morn &s;mile on us with Paternal Rays, and deck us with its cleare&s;t Gems, while the Gignatick Trees around (as our Life-Guards) protected us from the Fury of in&s;ulting Winds, and only &s;uffered the Fans of gentle <HI>Zephyrs</HI> to
<PB N="175" REF="178">
refre&s;h us. Thus for long Tracts of Time did each reviving Spring cheri&s;h our Infant Days, and Summer's Heat mature us, di&s;|clo&s;ing all their various Beauties to us, and e'er ill-boding Winter, that mortal Foe of an|nual Plants, frowned on us, we in a good old Age retired to endle&s;s Re&s;t within our Mo|ther's Bo&s;om.</P>
<P>But alas! tho&s;e happy Times are now no more! For a malicious <HI>Indian</HI> (for what Cau&s;e we know not) committed (&s;ome Ages &s;ince) a grave Ance&s;tor of ours to the de|vouring Flames, the Odors of who&s;e Death procured us all the Injuries we have &s;ince received; for we no longer lived or died in Peace, but fell an ea&s;y and defencele&s;s Prey to numberle&s;s Tortures, invented by the barbarous Nations round, to ravi&s;h from us all our new di&s;covered Sweets and Vir|tues,</P>
<P>This was not long our Ca&s;e before the In|habitants of an unknown World came, and inflicted on them as many Deaths as they on us; a ju&s;t Return for their inhumance Treat|ment of us poor Innocents! But the&s;e too proved, alas! as mercile&s;s as tho&s;e, and have ever &s;ince forced us into Life by their mali|cious Art and cruel Care, to be untimely torn from our Mother's Brea&s;t, then left to &s;corch with Thir&s;t and pine away, and in|&s;tead of a kind Burial in our Native Soil, tran&s;ported us to far di&s;tant Regions, where our withered Fle&s;h &s;tripped from our &s;hrivel'd Bones, was cut in a Thou&s;and Pieces by En|gines of a dire Invention.</P>
<P>Nor are the&s;e la&s;t Complaints unju&s;t, for though when plucked from Earth our Vegetation cea&s;es, yet do we &s;till retain our Spirits in full Strength, and &s;o are never
<PB N="176" REF="179">
relea&s;ed from Pain till totally con&s;umed in Flames.</P>
<P>To enumerate the Qualities I have been famed for, the U&s;age I have met with, and the various, and &s;ometimes contrary Effects a&s;cribed to my powerful Operations, would be an endle&s;s Task; I &s;hall in&s;tance there|fore only in &s;ome few.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t I was the Pri&s;oner of the meane&s;t Sort, confined in greazy Pouches, and vi&s;i|ted with them my native Fields and Hedges: But I &s;oon got the E&s;teem of tho&s;e who kept me in a nearer, though a &s;tronger Pri&s;on, and &s;o was introduced to Shops and Taverns. Then the learned Faculty began their curious Searches into my hidden Virtues, and could not long conceal their good Opinion of me, which quickly exalted me to the &s;ublime&s;t Heads, &s;o that the State&s;man, Lawyer, and Divine, admitted me to their Clo&s;ets and their Studies; and I have often &s;ince been the ob&s;tetrical A&s;&s;i&s;tant of many a teeming Brain. How often have I created a keen Appetite to him that before had none; and, which is &s;tranger, as often filled a hungry Belly? Many a Time have I received the Thanks of the Scholar at his Books, the Trader at his Accounts, and the Soldier in the Camp, for the Thoughts I have in&s;pired, the Compo&s;edne&s;s I have occa&s;ioned, and the Refre&s;hment I have admini&s;tred. The Sick have prai&s;ed my Cures, the Healthy my Preventions, the Solitary my Amu&s;ements; and thus have I gratified the greate&s;t Part of the Male World, but generally been the Aver|&s;ion of the Fair.</P>
<P>I was once indeed the private Favourite of a Maiden Lady, but unfortunately di&s;covered by her Admirer, by being forgotten to be
<PB N="177" REF="180">
thru&s;t behind the Hangings; and he, not a|ble to brook &s;o di&s;gu&s;tful a Rival, immediate|ly di&s;mi&s;s'd his Suit, which produced a Shy|ne&s;s between the whole Sex and me in my ancient <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">orm ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>But &s;ince I have been refined by the new Mode of cru&s;hing me to &s;malle&s;t Atoms, in|&s;tead of being kept Pri&s;oner as before to ex|pire in Flames, I have had all the Riches of the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> be&s;towed in fitting up Apartments for me, and am become the con&s;tant and be|loved Companion of the mo&s;t celebrated Wits and Beauties. I freely vi&s;it now the Church, the Court, the Man&s;ions of the Great, the Tea-Table, and the Clo&s;et, and every Re|&s;ort of highe&s;t Quality.</P>
<P>Nay, I'm not refu&s;ed the Virgin Bed, but often dwell at Midnight on the &s;weete&s;t Lips, and wake the cha&s;te&s;t Fair with Longings to embrace me. By this new Art I gain a free Admi&s;&s;ion to the Brain too, and am as it were immortalized by being almo&s;t mixed with Thought it &s;elf. But what I value more than all is, that I am the riche&s;t Jewel in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Diadem.</P>

<P>HAving, as I formerly ob&s;erved, pa&s;&s;ed through an infinite Variety of Scenes in humane Life, I cannot better employ the Re|flections I have made upon them, than by in|&s;tructing tho&s;e in the Paths they ought to pur|&s;ue who&s;e Youth and Unexperience would o|therwi&s;e betray them into a Thou&s;and Mi|&s;takes.

<PB N="179" REF="182">
Mi&s;application of my Parts and Learning, came to an ignoble End. This is a reigning Misfortune among&s;t the Genius's of the pre&s;ent Age, but has indeed prevailed much more in &s;ome foregoing Reigns. It is with the utmo&s;t Indignation that I &s;ee many great Capacities pro&s;tituted to the mo&s;t unworthy Purpo&s;es, and the World in a Manner corrupted and de|bauched by Per&s;ons who&s;e Talents &s;eem in|tended for the Ornament and Reformation of it. Next to the Want of Morality, I bewail the Narrowne&s;s of Fortune which too often pre&s;&s;es Men of a liberal Education, and which perhaps is one Step towards leading them into the former. A young Fellow who is unea&s;y in his Circum&s;tances, is naturally betrayed into tho&s;e Follies which recommend him to Compa|ny, and give him Hopes of making an Ac|quaintance that may one Time or other turn to his Advantage. With this View he gives into many Fooleries that he &s;ecretly de&s;pi&s;es, and at la&s;t is harden'd into Vices which he former|ly abhorred. The Students of both Univer&s;i|ties are on this Account in a peculiar Manner the Objects of my Care and Concern. As of|ten as I &s;ee a new Face about Town, that pro|mi&s;es much good Under&s;tanding, and a lively Imagination, I conclude it came up by the la&s;t Coach from <HI>Oxford</HI> or <HI>Cambridge.</HI> I am im|mediately upon the Rack to con&s;ider the many Difficulties &s;uch a one mu&s;t encounter, the At|tendance he mu&s;t pay to in&s;olent Greatne&s;s, the frequent Shocks he will receive from the Promotion of inferior Merit, from the Di&s;&s;imu|lation of &s;ome, and the Envy of others; and at la&s;t, from the mean Reward he is likely to meet with for a long Cour&s;e of Slavery and Dependance.</P>

<P>IF the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of Mankind do really fit &s;o near you as we are given to under&s;tand by your Paper of the 27th of the la&s;t Month, I have but too ju&s;t a Right to your Compa&s;|&s;ion, and the mo&s;t tender Advice you can be&s;tow upon me.</P>
<P>It was not long &s;ince my good Fortune to be a Member of &mdash; College in <HI>Oxford,</HI> where I &s;pent Four Years in a Manner per|fectly innocent and agreeable to my Temper. Good Part of my Time was &s;pent in Reading, the re&s;t in &s;uch Amu&s;ements as the Place af|forded. I was generally well e&s;teemed by the few I was known to, and being not much turned to Gallantry, made a Shift to be ea&s;y without the Company of Ladies, which, eve|ry Body knows, are &s;carce in tho&s;e Parts. During this Retirement, I happened to write a Copy of Ver&s;es which alarmed Two or Three of the Top Book&s;ellers in this Town, and gave them Hopes of me for a future Author of &s;ome more con&s;iderable Work. Whether they employed my Acquaintance to flatter me on that Occa&s;ion I know not, but, to my utter Ruin, I received incredible Ap|plau&s;e for my Performance. Soon after, I took it in my Head that the Univer&s;ity was too narrow a Sphere for me to act in. I
<PB N="181" REF="184">
formed to my &s;elf great Notions of my Re|putation at <HI>London,</HI> and thought it would be taken ami&s;s, if I did not go and vi&s;it my Friends and Admirers there. I made a Jour|ney accordingly, and had the Honour to be introduced to &s;ome Per&s;ons of a con&s;iderable Figure. Now, thought I, my Fortune is made; I have &s;een the greate&s;t General, and the be&s;t Poet in <HI>Europe.</HI> My old Friends in the mean Time whom I had left behind me, &s;ent frequent Letters of Congratulation upon the Pro&s;pect I had of coming into the Mini|&s;try, which I received, and an&s;wered with the Air and Style of one that was already in Em|ployment. I affected, for In&s;tance, a new Way of writing my Name, of making up my Paper, and of &s;ub&s;cribing my &s;elf according to the Forms received in the Offices about <HI>Whitehall.</HI> The great Civility and good Man|ners of many whom I was pre&s;ented to, had like to have led me into &s;ome Mi&s;take: Through my great Ignorance, and Want of Breeding, I believed every Word they &s;aid to me; and when they a&s;&s;ured me, <HI>they would do me any Service that lay in their Power, that they had a great Opinion of my Merit, and only wanted an Opportunity to &s;hew it;</HI> I had no more Complai&s;ance than to take them at their Words, and look out for Occa&s;ions of trying their Friend&s;hip. In the mean while my &s;lender Fortune run out a|pace; the Spleen &s;ucceeded, and I am now, in every E&s;&s;ential, as errant a Wit as any about Town. Words cannot expre&s;s the Shame, Scorn, and Regret I have for my pa&s;t Indi&s;cretion, which I can no other|wi&s;e atone for than by laying it open in this Way for the Good of others, and applying at the &s;ame Time for Advice to Mr. <HI>Bicker|&s;taff</HI>

<P>IN taking a Survey of Mankind, one cannot but ob&s;erve an univer&s;al Pur&s;uit of what they call Plea&s;ure, and at the &s;ame Time the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Mi&s;takes about the Notion of it. Not to enter into more Particulars, let it &s;uffice, that in the Catalogue of Things conducing to this End, Friend&s;hip is generally omitted, and either not at all con&s;idered, or el&s;e exploded and laughed out of Countenance. The Truth is, our Vanity &s;eems to have got the better of our Rea&s;on, and choo&s;e rather to appear happy than be &s;o. Hence it is, that in&s;tead of cultivating an Intimacy with a few, we make a &s;uperficial Acquaintance with all that offer, and are more de&s;irous of being &s;een by a Multi|tude, than rightly known and under&s;tood by any. The Want of Virtue is at the Bottom of all this: Having no true Principles of Honour, Genero&s;ity, or good Nature, we naturally a|void being too &s;trictly enquired into, and there|fore are cautious that tho&s;e about us &s;hould not take any Freedom beyond what a mixed

<P>I Came hither about a Week &s;ince, being forced from <HI>London,</HI> where I &s;pent the Winter, by the Commands of my Mother, who took it in her Head that I grew too fond of that Place, and was in Danger of throwing my &s;elf away upon &s;ome idle young Fellow or other.

Formerly indeed I could &s;pend whole Days and Nights in turning over my Romances; I could with infinite Plea&s;ure rove about the Wilderne&s;s, in our Garden, and charm the Rival Nightingales with the Mu&s;ick of my Flute.

<P>The Ca&s;e of <HI>Belinda</HI> is in my Opinion very deplorable, and would, if fully con&s;idered, give Occa&s;ion to many u&s;eful Reflections. At pre&s;ent I &s;hall only ob&s;erve upon it, that the Blemi&s;h &s;he has received in her own Character is by no Means a Step towards a Power and Juri&s;diction over the Conduct of others. I am not unwilling to admit &s;ome of the Fair Sex into the Employment &s;he &s;ollicits for, having in general a great Opinion of their Capacities, as well as of their earne&s;t De&s;ire to reform the Manners of tho&s;e about them. It may not however be ami&s;s to give the Electors in this Point a &s;hort Ab&s;tract of the Qualifications re|qui&s;ite to a Female Cen&s;or, le&s;t any Mi&s;takes &s;hould happen upon &s;o weighty an Affair: As fir&s;t, That &s;he is indeed with an habitual Si|lence; Secondly, That &s;he has a known Ha|tred to Scandal and Detraction; Thirdly, That &s;he neither pays nor receives any impertinent Vi&s;its; Fourthly, That &s;he is a con&s;tant Rea|der of the <HI>Tatler;</HI> And Fifthly and La&s;tly, That &s;he has, be&s;ides other Books, a huge <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> of Receipts.</P>

me, which is allowed to be extremely like, and no le&s;s beautiful, though at the &s;ame Time my Face is but very indifferent. By this Means he has rai&s;ed the Expectation of all who have &s;een the Piece, to my great Di&s;ad|vantage in the Di&s;po&s;al of my Per&s;on. Every Body allows that he has &s;hewn him&s;elf an admirable Painter, and &s;ecretly wi&s;h, that Nature had been as kind as Art has been in|dulgent to me. For my own Sake therefore, and that of many others in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ame Cir|cum&s;tances, I humbly move the Court for &s;peedy Sentence on &s;o notorious an Offen|der.</P>

<P>I Have examined your Lucubrations with the utmo&s;t Care and Diligence, but can find nothing relating to my pre&s;ent Ca&s;e. Whether your Thoughts have been employed on more u&s;eful Subjects, or whether Circum|&s;tances &s;o entirely alter the Nature of Things that it is impo&s;&s;ible to define them; but if &s;o it happens, that the Importunity which a Man &s;hould u&s;e in the Recovery of his Own has wholly e&s;caped you, I could read a Di&s;|&s;ertation of yours upon Dunning with more Plea&s;ure than I ever looked at a new-fa&s;hio|ned

Toy. You only can direct us how far a Gentleman may be decently pre&s;&s;ed, and whether Per&s;onally or by Billet is the more proper Method.</P>
<P>If you knew how much I was intere&s;ted in this Affair, I per&s;wade my &s;elf, your Concern for the Sex would ha&s;ten your Re&s;olution. I cannot look at poor <HI>Charles</HI>'s Face without bathing it with a Flood of Tears. Had he &s;old Ca&s;t Work for Hammer'd, or Horn for Tortoi&s;e-Shell, I could moderate my Re&s;ent|ments; but to be kick'd, di&s;abled, and caned like a Stockfi&s;h for only demanding his Due, is an Indignity not to be &s;uffered in a free Country.</P>

<P>ONE great De&s;ign of this Paper is to re|concile Men to their &s;everal Stations in Life, and to remove that Unea&s;ine&s;s which commonly ari&s;es from the &s;uppo&s;ed Advantages of tho&s;e about them. Unle&s;s this be in &s;ome Mea&s;ure effected, it is in vain to expect any great Succe&s;s from Precepts of another Kind; a Per&s;on who is out of Humour being as in|capable of receiving Advice as be&s;towing it on others. The Stake chiefly contended for is Power, and this, if I mi&s;take not, is more equally divided than we commonly imagine. The executive Part of it &s;eems indeed to be pretty much engro&s;s'd by Men of great For|tunes and large Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. They, 'tis true, carry about them all the Di&s;tinctions of Gran|deur and Superiority, they are attended by Maces, adorned with Ribands, and crowded by a numerous Train of Dependants. In the
<PB N="198" REF="201">
mean Time it mu&s;t be no &s;mall Satisfaction for a Man who is inclined to envy them &s;uch pom|pous Appearances, to make a &s;trict Enquiry in|to &s;ome other Circum&s;tances which are not al|together &s;o much expo&s;ed to the publick View. He will by this Means di&s;cover that the&s;e great Machines are informed, turned and directed by the mo&s;t minute Springs and Movements; that in many In&s;tances, a menial Servant has the Management of their highe&s;t Concerns, and di&s;po&s;es of their Actions as he in his great Wi&s;dom &s;hall judge mo&s;t convenient for them.</P>
<P>As my Cou&s;in <HI>Humphrey</HI> and my &s;elf were taking a Walk in the <HI>Park</HI> the other Day, a Per&s;on of Note pa&s;&s;ed by us with an Air of In&s;o|lence and Contempt, attended by a very mag|nificent Equipage. He, with his u&s;ual Free|dom, taking me a&s;ide, de&s;ired me to ob&s;erve that fine Thing, and to give my Opinion of him. Ob&s;erving me a little re&s;erved upon the Matter, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>I&s;aac</HI> (&s;ays he) with &s;ome Indigna|tion, You are the greate&s;t Coward in the World: Had I put the &s;ame Que&s;tion to you upon Fifty others of Five hundred Times the Worth of inferior Rank, you would have made no Scruple of &s;peaking your Sentiments. I will tell you then; That Gentleman you &s;ee there, is one Way or other in Subjection to every one of tho&s;e Fellows that dangle after him. I happen (continued he) to be well ac|quainted in his Family, in which there is a Chain of Intere&s;ts carried on after the fol|lowing Manner: The Steward, who is an old Servant, and has cheated his Ma&s;ter Time out of Mind, has the entire Government of him. The Hou&s;ekeeper has a Hank, as they call it, over the Steward, and makes &s;in|gular U&s;e of him in all impertinent Affairs.
<PB N="199" REF="202">
The Page has no le&s;s Intere&s;t in the Hou&s;e|keeper, at the &s;ame Time that he is him&s;elf in Love with the Chambermaid. <HI>Ro&s;e,</HI> for that is her Name, profe&s;&s;es a Pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI> the Footman, who is deeply &s;mitten with dirty <HI>Moll</HI> the Kitchen Wench. The latter of the&s;e has in Conclu&s;ion a great Sway in what|ever Ca&s;es &s;he thinks fit to exert her Inte|re&s;t, which, if &s;he were made &s;en&s;ible of it, would undoubtedly afford her no &s;mall Com|fort under the con&s;tant Hurry and Fatigue of her painful Occupation.'</Q></P>
<P>Having but little Knowledge of great Fami|lies, I was not before aware that this Scheme of Government was received among&s;t them; but in the Compa&s;s of my own Acquaintance I have &s;eldom &s;een it otherwi&s;e. Old Major <HI>Matchlock,</HI> I remember, was a very blu&s;tering Fellow over a Bottle, and withal made a good terrible Figure at the Head of a Company; but within his own Doors he behaved him&s;elf with great Pu&s;illanimity, and paid the utmo&s;t Subjection to an ancient Maid, whom in le&s;s than Forty Years he had rai&s;ed from raking in a Heap of Cinders, to the Superintendancy over all his dome&s;tick Affairs. I am not in my own Nature much addicted to Fear, yet I can|not but confe&s;s that I &s;tand in Awe of my old Servant <HI>Mary.</HI> She happens to be of a mild Di&s;po&s;ition, which makes her Authority fit the more ea&s;y upon me; but if it were otherwi&s;e, I do not pre&s;ume that I &s;hould have Courage enough to make Head again&s;t her. As &s;he has few other Favourites or Companions than my Dog and tabby Cat, there is no Danger of her leading me into any Ab&s;urdities on their Behalf.</P>

<P>THere is nothing more &s;hocking to a gene|rous Mind, than to &s;ee his Labours ren|dered vain and fruitle&s;s.

<P>AMong the many Benefits which Mankind has received from your Lucubrations, that of improving and poli&s;hing our Conver|&s;ation has been none of the lea&s;t. Your di|&s;tingui&s;hing the different Characters of Men by the In&s;truments of Harmony, has given mo&s;t an Inclination to be mu&s;ical; each pre|paring and hoping to appear in a better Cla&s;s. This innocent Ambition has had an Effect even on the lowe&s;t Kind, and I have known &s;ome Drums, de&s;pairing of ever getting a fi|ner Note, content to be &s;ilent; a great Ne|gative Ble&s;&s;ing to tho&s;e unhappy Gentlemen who were &s;ometimes condemned to be Part of their Audience! But, Sir, there is Need of a farther Reformation, there are &s;ome People who have formed to them&s;elves a Sound that comes under no Denomination you have yet imparted to the World; indeed there are not many of this Sect, nor &s;hould I

take any Notice of them, but that I have ve|ry lately ob&s;erved they begin to get Con|verts. The&s;e noi&s;y Men have their Fits come upon them very con&s;tantly, and with very little Intermi&s;&s;ion, yet they can be &s;ometimes articulate; but then I don't ob&s;erve tho&s;e Tokens of Mirth which they &s;how at the End of the Paroxi&s;m. I have &s;een one of them jump out of his Chair, and &s;uddenly getting his Legs from the Ground five or &s;ix Times, make &s;uch a Noi&s;e as Nature gave us not Ears to receive, which has ended in about Seven Minutes in a &s;trong loud Laugh, ac|companied with the re&s;t of the Sect, if there be any pre&s;ent, (for the Fit often takes 'em a|mong Strangers) who join in the Chorus. I have &s;een your great Ma&s;ters of Noi&s;e, Fox|hunters, Bombardiers, Gunners of all Kinds, Sailers, who are Judges of Storms, amazed at their prodigious Vociferation. I &s;hould take them to be &s;omething Enthu&s;ia&s;tical, but there is no Shew of Religion among them. The <HI>Hottentotts,</HI> (a <HI>Free People</HI>) as the <HI>Dutch</HI> Travellers tell us, come near them in Sound, but with le&s;s Impetuo&s;ity.

<P>I AM oblig'd to vi&s;it my old Friend <HI>Horten&s;ius</HI> every <HI>April,</HI> when his <HI>Auricula</HI>'s are in Blo&s;|&s;om. He tells me, he &s;hould be as much di&s;|appointed if his Friends did not come and &s;ee him while his Garden is in its Pride, as a fine Lady would be on her Day, if no Body came to admire how well &s;he was lighted up.</P>
<P>I went down on <HI>Monday</HI> la&s;t to his Hou&s;e. It was almo&s;t dark when I arrived, and I found my Friend watering his Pots with his own Hand, and covering the choice&s;t of them with Gla&s;&s;es, le&s;t the Inclemency of one Fro&s;ty Night, in &s;o uncertain a Climate as ours is, &s;hould &s;horten the Duration of a Plea&s;ure which is but too Tran&s;itory even in its longe&s;t Continuance.

After the Cloth was taken away, <Q REND="inline">'Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff,</HI> &s;aid he, I fancy you look with a good deal of Contempt upon our Country Amu&s;ements: Is it not very odd to find me doing the &s;ame Thing to Night, that

Ah! dear <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> &s;aid my Friend, there's the Point, to find out &s;ome Entertainment that will not find out that we grow old, and &s;uch a one I believe I have made Choice of. By that Means I conver&s;e daily with the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">wdie&s;t Part of the Creation; for &s;ince there is no Body here to tell it again to the Toa&s;ts, I mu&s;t own to you, that I think Nature has been no where &s;o la|vi&s;h of her Beauties, as among&s;t the Birds and Flowers.

Pray, Friend <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> when Man was made lit|tle lower than the Angels, what was he? A Prince, a General, or a Great Mini&s;ter? Nei|ther. He was a Gardiner. Pray what is it
<PB N="208" REF="211">
that di&s;tingui&s;hes Man from Bea&s;ts? Why all Philo&s;ophers &s;ay, Rea&s;on.

But how is that?

one in a Romance, that if it would not make this Paper too long, I could be content to de|&s;cribe it: About Seven a Clock my Friend came into my Chamber, and told me I was going to be very Happy as &s;oon as I had drank my Cho|colate, for every Thing con&s;pired to make our Walk &s;o plea&s;ant, that, what with the Perfume of the Flowers, and the Harmony of the Birds, he que&s;tioned whether I would regret either the Smoak or the Noi&s;es of <HI>London.</HI> There were Two Parterres on either Side of the Hou&s;e, which were &s;eparated by a neat E&s;pa|lier from the re&s;t of the Garden.

<P>ONE great Inducement to me in removing to this End of the Town, was for the Benefit of the Air in St. <HI>James</HI>'s <HI>Park,</HI> where I u&s;ually take one Turn in the Morning, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> it be any Thing like Weather, another as &s;oon as my Pipe is done after Dinner. In my Walk the other Day I met with &s;o odd an Adventure, that I can't help being particular in the Relation of it; e&s;pecially &s;ince, in Regard to Po&s;terity, it may &s;erve to clear up one of the mo&s;t impor|tant Pa&s;&s;ages of my Life. Ju&s;t by the <HI>Cock-Pit,</HI> at the <HI>Privy-Garden</HI> Door, there &s;tep'd up gently to me an ancienti&s;h Woman, in a little black Hood, a Whisk Band, and a Crape Gown, and in a &s;oft low Voice calls to me, "<HI>Sir.</HI> I could never think it Charity to relieve your Street-Beggars: What little I do in that Kind, is chiefly to Charity-Schools, and decayed Hou&s;e|keepers. So on I walk'd, and &s;he after me. <Q REND="inline">'But, Sir, &s;ays &s;he again with a re&s;pectful Whi&s;per, I am a Gentlewoman. Gentle or Simple, &s;aid I, that's nothing to me; Prithee,

Woman, be gone about thy Bu&s;ine&s;s: This is not a Place for you."</Q> When &s;he had got me to an&s;wer her, &s;he proceeds, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, you look like a Gentleman; and my Ca&s;e is really &s;uch, that if you knew but Half&mdash;I don't de|&s;ire to know a Quarter,"</Q> &s;aid I. But the Wo|man was &s;o very civil, and withal &s;o very im|portunate, that I could not help turning about to her; and with that &s;he pulls Two or Three dirty torn Papers out of her Stays, and offers them me to read. <Q REND="inline">"Pray Mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;aid I, what is it you would have of me? This is not a Place to read Papers in: But my Name is &s;o, I live in &s;uch a Place, and if you think it worth your while to come to me when I have more Lei&s;ure, I'll hear what you have to &s;ay.'</Q> I ob&s;erved &s;he changed Colour upon hearing my Name, and coming up clo&s;er to me, told me, <Q REND="inline">"Nothing but the greate&s;t Nece&s;&s;ity could have brought her to this: Her Education, it was well known, had been above any &s;uch Thing, till the Frowns of Fortune had redu|ced her to this Condition.

Ah! dear Sir, &s;aid &s;he, there was a Time when one of your Name would have given me a kinder An&s;wer."</Q> This brought a Thou&s;and confu|&s;ed Imaginations into my Head, and I felt &s;omething awakening within me that I could not account for.

Ah! Mr. <HI>Bicker|&s;taff,</HI> &s;he replied, Is it po&s;&s;ible you &s;hould have forgot me? But indeed the Troubles I have gone thro' &s;ince you and I danced toge|ther at the Mayor's Fea&s;t at <HI>Litchfield,</HI> would have altered a better Face than I could ever pretend to. Whatever Changes Time and Trouble may have made in you, &s;aid I, I'm &s;ure it has not made &s;o much in me, but that I am mightily concerned to know what has happened to you, &s;ince I am now a&s;&s;ured you can be no other than Mrs. <HI>Olivia Darkin,</HI> for whom once I pa&s;s'd &s;o many unea&s;y Mi|nutes. Well, Mr. <HI>Bicker&s;taff,</HI> I mu&s;t own&mdash;But pray &s;it down, &s;aid I&mdash;And <HI>Mary,</HI> D'ye hear? Bring me a Pint of that Sack in the Corner, and bake a Toa&s;t. Well, pray go on. Why truly, Sir, as I was &s;aying, I did perceive you had a Kindne&s;s for me; but alas! What could you expect of a giddy|headed young Thing as I was in tho&s;e Days? For you mu&s;t know, Sir, that Mr. <HI>Mac-Carrot,</HI> that you &s;aw at our Hou&s;e, had engaged my Affections before I came from the Boarding-School; but I am &s;ure I have lived to repent it every Vein of my Heart that ever I cro&s;s'd the Seas with him. In &s;hort, Sir, we were no &s;ooner married, but he carried me over with him to the County of <HI>Kerry,</HI> where he had Relations who were well enough to pa&s;s, and what with their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and that little we had of our own, we made a pretty good Shift for &s;ome Years, 'till the War breaking out in <HI>Ireland,</HI> my Husband was too zealous for the Popi&s;h Intere&s;t, and entered into the Service of the late K&mdash; <HI>J&mdash;s.</HI> I told him

over and over what would come of it. He gave me no An&s;wer, but that it was his Opi|nion, and he would &s;tand and fall by it; and Child, &s;aid he, you are a Fool if you don't turn Catholick. Never talk on it, &s;aid I, I'll die a Thou&s;and Deaths before I'll change my Religion, and &s;o he never pre&s;s'd me any more about it. But as I had foretold, &s;o it happened, he was killed at the Siege of <HI>Li|merick,</HI> and our Hou&s;e plundered; I may &s;afely &s;ay they did not leave me the Value of this Rag to wind about my Finger."</Q> And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">en &s;he bur&s;t out a Crying. <Q REND="inline">"Ha! &s;aid I, this is a melancholy Story indeed; come, here's to you, I'll promi&s;e you 'tis a Gla&s;s of good Sack: But pray did his Relations do nothing for you? Relations! Ah Lord! &s;aid &s;he, they were his Relations, not mine; and when he went, all went with him: You mu&s;t think, Sir, I went to 'em, but they looked as coldly upon me as if I came to take the Bread out of their Mouths. At la&s;t, they agreed among 'em to take one of my Girls off my Hands, and gave me Five Pounds to carry me over to <HI>England.</HI> But when I came there, I was never the near, for I had anger'd all my Friends in Marrying; and I dare &s;ay &s;ome of 'em were glad to &s;ee me in &s;uch Nece&s;&s;ity. At la&s;t an Aunt of mine &s;ent me Word I &s;hould be welcome to her in <HI>Staf|ford&s;hire,</HI> where, being a Widow, and old and infirm, I was &s;erviceable to her in the Nature of her Hou&s;e-keeper. It plea&s;ed God &s;he died in about Two Years after, and left me in Money and Goods to the Value of Four hundred Pounds. Upon this I pluck'd up a good Heart again, and had &s;everal Of|fers made me from &s;ub&s;tantial Farmers of good Repute in the Neighbourhood; but it
<PB N="220" REF="223">
was a Sort of Life I did not care for, and having no Thoughts of altering my Condi|tion, nothing would &s;erve me but I mu&s;t come up to Town here; and having a Stock of Linen, and other good Things that my Aunt left me, I hired a hand&s;ome Hou&s;e, and took Lodgers. Well, why this put you in a good Way again, &s;aid I, interrupting her. Yes indeed, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, I had &s;everal Par|liament-Men and other very good Gentlemen in my Hou&s;e, and lived as creditably as any Body in my Employ; &s;o that in a few Years I thought I &s;hould be able to do very well for my Children. Pray what Children might you have, &s;aid I, be&s;ides the <HI>Girl</HI> you were mentioning in <HI>Ireland.</HI> I had a Son and Daughter, &s;aid &s;he, and as hopeful they were, though I &s;ay it, as any Woman would wi&s;h to be Mother of. But there was a Gen|tleman in my Hou&s;e who belonged to the Army, a civil Man to my thinking, as ever came under any Body's Roof. I never heard an Oath come out of his Mouth, he paid me punctually every <HI>Monday</HI> Morning, and was &s;o ea&s;y and contented, that I thought I could never do enough for him.

and as &s;oon as &s;he was up, Well, Mother, &s;ays &s;he, I will not live here to be a Di&s;grace to you, I'll try my Fortune in the <HI>Indies.</HI> So I agreed with a <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Captain of my Acquaintance, &s;ince the Girl had &s;uch a Mind to travel into foreign Parts; but the fir&s;t News I had by the Return of the Ships was, that &s;he died of the Di&s;temper of the Coun|try. Still I was in Hopes my Son <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> would do well; but he was got in with an idle Gang, who would &s;end for him at all Hours in the Night. I was fond of him, and &s;ed him with Money till I was almo&s;t redu|ced again, in Hopes to reclaim him by fair Means: At other Times I would talk to him &s;eriou&s;ly, and tell him he had had another Sort of an Education: But nothing would do; I found I was but a Woman; he would give me the Hearing, and then away to his Comrades. But one Day above the re&s;t, there was a great Noi&s;e of a Robbery and Murder that had been committed upon <HI>Bag&s;hot-Heath,</HI> and my Son, among others, was taken up and carried to <HI>Newgate.</HI> Upon his Tryal, he confe&s;&s;ed he was among them, and was found guilty; but he declared with his la&s;t Breath, he was not concerned in the Murder. I was with him every Day after his Condem|nation. He told me all along he was willing to die; but I did what I could with Money and Friends, till I had nothing left, to get his Pardon; and a Gentleman who belonged to the Court, and had formerly been my Lodger, gave me Hopes to the la&s;t, and bid me fear nothing, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">o that my Son &s;hould not &s;uffer.

is it come to this? I repented afterwards that I had deluded my poor Child with vain Promi&s;es; for he relied &s;o much upon them, that I am afraid he did not make &s;o good an End as he &s;hould have done.

<P>EVER &s;ince I have taken upon me the Of|fice of Cen&s;or of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> it has been my principal Care to guard my &s;elf again&s;t all Manner of ju&s;t Reproaches, which might depretiate tho&s;e whole&s;ome Maxims which I every Day di&s;tribute to the Publick, and to fence again&s;t all tho&s;e Vices which render old Age contemptible. And 'tis wholly owing to this that I have never fallen into that common Weakne&s;s of finding Fault with the pre&s;ent only for an Excu&s;e to cry up the la&s;t Age. I mu&s;t own I have had a great Itch to do it, but as I weigh every Thing before I attempt doing it, I find upon mature Deliberation, that ge|nerally
<PB N="224" REF="227">
&s;peaking the Age is virtuou&s;ly inclined, and that what Faults it has proceed chiefly from excellent Principles, and might be made Virtues with a very little Trouble. For, in the fir&s;t Place, I ob&s;erve that Part of Mankind, where one would lea&s;t expect it, to be wonder|fully inclined to Oeconomy; I mean the Young and the Fair of Quality. No Fro&s;t, Snow, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Ea&s;t Wind, can hinder a large Set of People from going to the Park in <HI>February,</HI> no Du&s;t nor Heat in <HI>June.</HI> And this is come to &s;uch an intrepid Regularity, that tho&s;e a|greeable Creatures that would &s;hriek at an hind Wheel in a deep Gutter, are not afraid, in their proper Sphere, of the Di&s;order and Danger of Seven Rings. But as the City does generally value it &s;elf upon out-doing t'other End of the Town in the&s;e Matters, &s;o I have long ob&s;erved, with infinite Satisfaction, a certain Coach, which I e&s;teem particularly. It belongs to a worthy Trader in or near <HI>Well-Clo&s;e,</HI> and no Di&s;paragement to <HI>Charles</HI>'s-<HI>Wain,</HI> it keeps its Cour&s;e as regularly as any Fix'd Star of 'em all. The Family to which this wondrous Automaton belongs, goes to Dinner as &s;oon as Morning Service is over, they &s;et out in the Cool of the Noon, about Half an Hour after Twelve, and, according to the Rule of di&s;creet Travellers, make the Coachman drive &s;lowly at fir&s;t, by which they have Two Ad|vantages; one, that they &s;ee all the Company go to Church in the City, and the other, that their Hor&s;es have Time to empty them&s;elves. At <HI>Charing-Cro&s;s</HI> they &s;top and give the Cattel a Mouthful of Hay, have a cool Tankard, or the like, and any of the Gentlewomen that have Occa&s;ion &s;tep out of the Coach. By the End of <HI>Suffolk-&s;treet</HI> they mend their Pace, and
<PB N="225" REF="228">
get into a tolerable Trot, which brings them &s;o happily to the farthe&s;t Part of their Journey, and in &s;uch good Time, that they are there as &s;oon as the be&s;t of 'em. I remember la&s;t Year I was over-again&s;t <HI>Northumberland</HI> Hou&s;e when this Caravan repo&s;ed there; they were Five of the Fair Sex, Three pretty fat ones, one very fat, and a lean one. They were all &s;ure of the Thou&s;and Pounds a Year in the Lottery, and almo&s;t fell out about their &s;everal Ways of Di&s;|po&s;ing of it.

I concluded with my &s;elf, that tho&s;e who come from the wary Part of the Town, had perhaps had the Precau|tion to in&s;ure in <HI>Exchange-Alley,</HI> without which

<P>I Cannot without Admiration behold the forward Preten&s;ions of the Youth of this Age, wherein we daily find Boys exerting the very fir&s;t Operations of their Minds in the mo&s;t ab&s;tru&s;e Parts of Learning; &s;o that one would th nk the Souls of their Great Grandfathers had tran&s;migrated into them. This praecoci|ous Wit, as it is very unbecoming in the Pre|&s;ence of a Man of my Years, &s;o is it likewi&s;e very ominous to the Per&s;ons who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with it; for they are generally &s;hort-liv'd, and give Occa&s;ion to their Mothers to &s;ay, The poor Child had too much Sen&s;e to live long. It is therefore my Opinion, That this great Vice takes its Beginning entirely from taking Chil|dren too &s;oon f om the Brea&s;t, and admitting them &s;o early to the U&s;e of a luxurious Variety in their Food, which forces an Under&s;tanding before its due Time. I have therefore, from a
<PB N="229" REF="232">
long Ob&s;ervation among&s;t young Fellows, as I find them in their Conver&s;ation, and according to the Subjects which they handle, been able to tell the very Day when the Nur&s;e applied the bitter Drug to the Nipple, to give them an Aver&s;ion to Sucking. There was a Law among that wi&s;e People the <HI>Romans,</HI> That no Man &s;hould kill above Thirty A&s;&s;es at a Time for a Banquet; and the Rea&s;on was, that they being a Creature then e&s;teemed a great Dainty, and a va&s;t Con&s;umption of them, there was found at length a great Defect of their Milk for the Education of the Offspring of the Common|wealth, to the un&s;peakable Pain and Labour of the good Women, who were otherwi&s;e obli|ged to &s;uckle their Children till they &s;hould be fit to carry Arms in Defence of their Coun|try. I have therefore, out of a due Re&s;pect to &s;uch an excellent Example, and to prevent the Inconveniencies of the&s;e too early E&s;&s;ays in Things of &s;ublime Science, ordered the inge|nious Mr. <HI>Charles Bubbleboy</HI> to get made for the U&s;e of the Publick, from Time to Time, a &s;ufficient Number of Sucking-Bottles, which all young Fellows under the Age of Twenty are to hang with a Chain about their Necks. And I likewi&s;e ordain, That when any Per&s;on under the Age above written &s;hall pre&s;ume to launch out of his Depth in Theoretical Learn|ing, it &s;hall be in the Power of any By-&s;tander to apply the Bottle to his Mouth, and make him &s;uck.</P>
<P>I hope by this Simplicity of Diet in &s;ome rea&s;onable Time &s;o far to reform the Manners of Youth in Conver&s;ation, that no one under the Age aforementioned &s;hall pre&s;ume to ex|ceed the Limits of Grammatical Learning in Di&s;cour&s;e; and likewi&s;e to augment the
<PB N="230" REF="233">
Strength and Stature of my Countrymen, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> well as their Under&s;tandings.</P>
<P>It has ever been the Cu&s;tom of our Family to bring up their Children without endeavou|ring to improve their Minds till their Bodies were grown to a full Maturity, and we were &s;uffered as it were to lie fallow without any Cultivation, till the Soil was rich enough to give a full Vigour and Exten&s;ion to the Seed that &s;hould be &s;own in it. For this Rea&s;on I was looked upon as a meer Idiot all the Time of my Childhood, and lived in a State of Ad|miration to an Age wherein others are wont to exert egregious Signs of Wi&s;dom. I remember very well, that I &s;ucked my Mother till I was able to carry my Cradle on my Back, and could not &s;peak a Word till I was Ten Years old, being a perfect <HI>Pythagorean</HI> by Nature, and always more inclinable to hear than talk, till I grew &s;o full of Conceptions, that at la&s;t I was obli|ged to give Vent by Writing, as my Thoughts oppre&s;s'd me, the Delivery of which hath had that wonderful Effect as to make me arrive at the Dignity of being Cen&s;or of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>

<P>MY Curio&s;ity led me the other Day to be pre&s;ent at the Election at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> School, where I met with an Entertainment of Juvenile Exerci&s;es &s;uitable to my Expecta|tion, and ob&s;erved with great Satisfaction tho&s;e pretty Velitations of Wit, which may be called the politer Parts of Grammatical Learning, and are the promi&s;ing Preludes of future Perfections in the &s;ublime Sciences. Tho&s;e little Epigram|matical Flowers, in which you behold Poetry in her Spring, very various in her Array of Co|lours, but not daring yet to &s;hoot high from the Earth, which were then offered up as Fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> Fruits to the Great <HI>Harlaeus,</HI> as they &s;hew their own Inability of &s;oaring high enough, yet they do in &s;ome Mea&s;ure point at that immen&s;e Heighth of Prai&s;e, which &s;hould be equal to
<PB N="233" REF="236">
the Subject commended, and which ought to be the particular Province of an Epick Poet.</P>
<P>When I fir&s;t entered the School, I was &s;truck with a becoming Awe and Veneration to &s;o &s;a|cred a Place, and the Dignity of the Per&s;on pre&s;iding in it, not without a due Regard to the <HI>Fa&s;ces,</HI> which are the Symbol of his Au|thority. I could not then forbear taking the Per&s;on and Office of a Schoolma&s;ter into a nearer Con&s;ideration, and to propo&s;e him to my Mind in the Ab&s;tract, with a View of what he teaches.</P>
<P>A Schoolma&s;ter is a compleat Trea&s;ury of cho&s;en Words from Cla&s;&s;ick Authors, the very Compo&s;ition of who&s;e Body does not &s;eem to owe it &s;elf &s;o much to the Four Phy&s;icical Ele|ments, as to the Four and twenty Letters of the Alphabet; and yet with &s;o little Confu&s;ion in his Contexture, that he &s;hall be able, as it were, to unravel his whole Sub&s;tance into Idi|oms, Proper Diction, Golden Sentences, Ver|&s;es, Themes, and Declamations. You would think the Oeconomy of his Hou&s;e was directed entirely according to the Three Special Rules, and that the Book of Ten&s;es &s;erved for a Clock to it. His proper Bu&s;ine&s;s is to teach Gram|mar, which he di&s;tributes as &s;ound Aliment to his Scholars, giving every one &s;uch a Portion for a Meal, and with that Impartiality, that no one complains of having too little.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t I was amu&s;ing my &s;elf with the&s;e Thoughts, which to &s;ome may &s;eem too ludi|crous on &s;o grave a Subject, (though I profe&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">t is far from my Intention to le&s;&s;en the Idea of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">o excellent a Function) I was diverted from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">urther pro&s;ecuting the Character, by being obli|ged

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU were plea&s;ed &s;ome Time &s;ince to make &s;everal Parts of Mankind the In&s;truments of much Mirth to the Town, and to deba&s;e humane Nature &s;o low, as to inclo&s;e &s;everal Per&s;ons in Viols and Harp&s;i|cords, for no other End but to play upon them. I would be glad one Part of the World could be diverted without the other's paying the Expence of it, and I have &s;uch a general Good-Will to every Thing that has Life, that I cannot &s;ee any of my Fellow Creatures abu&s;ed without a very &s;en&s;ible Concern. The ill U&s;age of Dogs (notwith|&s;tanding their Fidelity, which ought to have gained them the E&s;teem of all hone&s;t Men) is &s;o notorious, that 'tis become a Proverb; and I have long had a De&s;ign of vindicating the&s;e Animals in a regular Treati&s;e, in which I would oppo&s;e them to &s;everal Ranks of Men, and impartially examine the Merits on both Sides, and decide according to Ju&s;tice: But as my Bu&s;ine&s;s at pre&s;ent will not permit me to enter into &s;o large a Field as that Di&s;qui|&s;ition, I have &s;ent you up &s;ome Heads,

<P><HI>Bull-Dogs,</HI> though they have neither Fea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> nor Wit, yet being apt to fall upon any Thing that's tied to a Stake, and to make their Teeth meet when they have any, might be u&s;efully employed as Exe|cutioners of Ju&s;tice again&s;t publick Mi&s;|managers.</P>
<P><HI>French Spaniels,</HI> who generally profe&s;s the Doctrine of Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience, would make as good Courtiers as Setters; for they will lie &s;till while a Net is drawn over them, though they are caught them&s;elves in it, and will not &s;tir, in Hopes of having a dead Bird flung to them to mumble.</P>
<P>There are many Curs of all Denominations, that allow Re&s;i&s;tance in the extreame&s;t Nece&s;&s;ity: The&s;e are called Mad Dogs by the other Whelps, in hopes to get 'em knocked on the Head; but People don't ri&s;e upon them, notwith&s;tanding the Out|cry, becau&s;e they do not take 'em to be Driv'lers.</P>

<P>LOng have I laboured, and much have I travelled, for the Improvement of my Fellow-Subjects. I have not been wanting by my Speculations to &s;how the ea&s;y and plea&s;ant Ways to Virtue; nor have I been le&s;s &s;evere in cen&s;uring Vice wherever I met it, which I find every where increa&s;e, and come on apace, while Virtue &s;lowly creeps up, meets with continual Oppo&s;ition, and &s;eldom, very &s;eldom comes to that Perfection as to dare to look Vice in the Face; but then it ea&s;ily looks &s;uch fal&s;e Courage out of Countenance. It was mo&s;t amazing to me, when I was Ye&s;ter|day at St. <HI>James</HI>'s Coffee-hou&s;e, to &s;ee a for|ward Youth, well dre&s;&s;ed and powdered, whom I knew not only to be of very mean Extract, but of more de&s;picable Parts, lay his extraor|dinary Chin over a Duke's Shoulder, and as familiarly ask him impertinent Que&s;tions, as if his Equality or Intimacy entitled him to di|&s;turb that noble Peer, who, when he was de|livered from the Weight of his Chin, enquired who he was. How ea&s;y had it been for me to have told the Company, that that Place was
<PB N="246" REF="249">
indeed very fit for him, but in another Capaci+ty? However I only privately informed th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Ma&s;ter, who, in Re&s;pect to his Brother Coffee+Man, de&s;ired the Count to know him&s;elf, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> not be &s;o familiar with tho&s;e that he did no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> know.

<P><HI>Ordered</HI> therefore, That unle&s;s the &s;aid Do|ctor will conde&s;cend to be on the Level with Common Sen&s;e, his Tea be always Two De|grees under Proof; That he be allowed no Tobacco, nor the U&s;e of his own <HI>S. V. O.</HI> both too conducive to Agitation; but after having paid his Penny, you &s;how him the Situation of your Door.</P>
<P>What made me in &s;ome Mea&s;ure excu&s;e the Doctor's Vociferation was, that I did not &s;ee as u&s;ual the News-Papers, of which none could give Account, till in about Half an Hour's Time I &s;aw a Man come out of the Yard with a Handful, yet enquiring mo&s;t thir&s;tily for the <HI>Po&s;t-Boy;</HI> till he had that, he would not deliver the re&s;t. Upon Enquiry, I found him to be my old Friend the Uphol&s;terer revi|ved in a <HI>North-Briti&s;h</HI> Barber, who is &s;o great a Patriot, &s;o good a Politician, &s;o &s;ollicitous for the Grand Alliance in General, and &s;o tender of

<P>DI&s;couraged and wearied by the ill Succe&s;s of my Endeavours to reclaim this ob&s;ti|nate Age f om its Vices and Follies, I have of|ten had it in my Thoughts to quit my Office. My Friends all importune me to it, and one of them, whom in <HI>January</HI> la&s;t I had de&s;ired to continue this Paper during a nece&s;&s;ary Avoca|tion of mine, actually tried to lay it down hand&s;omly for me. Nothing has hindered me from complying with their Reque&s;ts, but a &s;trong Benevolence I have always had towards Mankind, and an ardent De&s;ire of doing &s;ome Good in my Generation. The&s;e alone have &s;upported me under my Di&s;appointment, and now prompt me to put in Execution a new Scheme, which is to abate &s;omething from the Grandeur of my Enterprize; and, &s;ince I can|not attain a greater Good, to attempt a le&s;s, no longer endeavouring to ea&s;e Men of their Fol|lies, but in their Follies; nor &s;triving to make
<PB N="249" REF="252">
Men &s;upportable to each other, but each one to him&s;elf. This Thought aro&s;e in me the o|ther Night at the Play, upon ob&s;erving &s;everal Difficulties that many of our Nobility and Gen|try laboured under. A pretty young Gentle|man tore his Breeches, and broke his Sword, by getting over the Box into the Pit, that he might have that Opportunity of expo&s;ing to Sight his Pearl-coloured Stockings and red-top'd Shoes. Another, who had a very fine Wig, and a Feather in his Hat, was forced to &s;it covered all the Time, and &s;poil the Wig to &s;hew the Feather. A Third, le&s;t his fring'd Gloves &s;hould not be &s;een, underwent the Pain of leaning forwards for a whole Play together upon the fore Part of the Box, &s;etting his Arms upright upon his Elbows. A Fourth, who was in low Circum&s;tances of Stature, every now and then with great Labour heaved into Sight a rich Sword-Knot: And many others were variou&s;ly hamper'd and perplex'd in di&s;playing their &s;everal Fineries. To remedy which In|conveniences, I at fir&s;t thought it might be pro|per to advi&s;e the Owners of the Play-hou&s;e to appropriate each Divi&s;ion of the Side-Boxes to a &s;everal Dre&s;s, and to di&s;tingui&s;h them by In|&s;criptions over them in large Letters in the&s;e and the like Words:<LIST>

<ITEM>Sword-Knots.</ITEM>

<ITEM>Fring'd Gloves.</ITEM>

<P>By which Means the whole Audience would at one Glance be appriz'd of the particular Or|nament of every Per&s;on in that Divi&s;ion.</P>

But reflecting &s;ince that this Invention would be of too narrow an U&s;e, (it being likely to ex|tend only to the Play-hou&s;e, and perhaps a Ca|thedral or two) I have applied my &s;elf to find out &s;omething that may be of general Ea&s;e to the Beau Monde; proceeding in this Manner; I con&s;idered what might be the Ri&s;e or Cau&s;e of all that va&s;t Variety of Fa&s;hions which we Yearly &s;ee.

This in the pre&s;ent Cour&s;e of Things will be an eternal Occa&s;ion of the Mutability of Fa&s;hions, and as a Man has but one Way of being in the Right, and Ten thou&s;and of be|ing in the Wrong, &s;o there can be but one Dre&s;s commodious, and as &s;oon as we deviate from that, we &s;hall find all the re&s;t trouble|&s;ome. I therefore thought, that if a Medium could be invented by me, whereby both the Fair and the Foul. Sex might at once be rid of the Incumbrances of the Mode, and be conti|nued in the Reputation of Profu&s;ene&s;s, I &s;hould do an acceptable Piece of Service to my Country, and procure to my &s;elf Peace of Mind in a Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that I had not lived in vain.

<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe Wit by Generals: We mu&s;t de&s;cend to Particulars, and trace it Part by Part. For Wit is like Beauty: We may admire the Air, the Symmetry, the whole Collection of Charms; but we cannot expre&s;s it without running over the Lip, the Neck, the Eye, the Brea&s;ts, and every individual Fea|ture. At pre&s;ent I &s;hall examine that Sort of Wit we call <HI>Turns.</HI> The&s;e appear to Advan|tage in &s;ome Parts of Poetry, which make their proper Province, but lo&s;e their Lu&s;tre when mi&s;placed, and have nothing to excu&s;e them, but an unbounded irregular Fancy. The Ornaments of Poetry, like tho&s;e of Dre&s;s, owe their <HI>Ecclat</HI> in a great Mea&s;ure to their Situa|tion. A Turn, that would have given Life to an <HI>Epigram,</HI> will make an Image in <HI>Heroicks</HI> particoloured and ridiculous; as the &s;ame Jew|el which adorned the Ear or the Neck, would in the No&s;e look mon&s;trous and rueful.

A Turn is the Creature of Fancy, that after it is born, is put under the Tuition of the Judg|ment, which is to a&s;&s;ign it a proper Station, and to &s;tint its Extravagancies. When it de|pends upon the Words or Style, great Care is to be u&s;ed that it may not dwindle into <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI> and <HI>Jingle;</HI> and when it con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in the Thought, the &s;ame Diligence is required that it may not &s;ink into any of tho&s;e <HI>Flowers</HI> of the School, or <HI>Common-Places</HI> of Youth, by which they gradually a&s;cend to this Attainment. Both the <HI>Real</HI> and <HI>Verbal Turn</HI> owe their Beau|ty to Novelty; for there is no greater Per|fection in the&s;e Wittici&s;ms, than what ari&s;es from that &s;udden Surprize they make upon the Imagination. They &s;eem to take their Name from their Nature; for they con&s;i&s;t mo&s;tly in advancing a Thought or Expre&s;&s;ion, and then making what follows, play upon it in an agreeable Way, either by retracting what went before, or wittily perverting it, or comparing it with &s;omething that hits the &s;ame Fact or Idea to any Degree of Exactne&s;s, or giving &s;ome &s;urprizing Rea&s;on for it when it &s;eemed a Paradox. Indeed, the Variety of Turns is &s;o great, and their Beauty &s;o entirely owing to this Variety, that it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to fix them to any &s;tated Rules. A <HI>Turn</HI> being the Product of Fancy, it is unnatural to u&s;e it but in tho&s;e gayer and more airy Parts of Poetry, where the Fancy is at Liberty to wanton and

gambol. In the <HI>Epick,</HI> in <HI>Tragedy,</HI> or in that Sort of <HI>Elegy</HI> which has Di&s;tre&s;s for its Subject, it would be ridiculous and trifling; for here the chief Bu&s;ine&s;s belongs to the Judgment, and the Fancy is only concerned in ranging for Images and Ideas equal to the Grandeur of the Subject. A Hero in a Pa&s;&s;ion, might as well expre&s;s the high Sentiments of his Soul by laughing at one of the Plumes out of his Hel|met, as by playing with a Turn or a Double Entendre. A Lover, lamenting the Rigour of his Mi&s;tre&s;s, or a Poet the Lo&s;s of his Friend, in this &s;portive Way, would make as aukward a Figure as the re&s;igned <HI>Ardelia,</HI> when &s;he laughs at the Mi&s;chiefs committed by her Monkey, though the Lo&s;s of her <HI>China</HI> wrings her very Soul; or an <HI>Iri&s;hman,</HI> in his Country Way, &s;inging at a Funeral. The Ancients had Abundance of this Sort of Wit, and u&s;ed it more di&s;creetly than the Moderns. The <HI>Greeks</HI> indeed appear perfect Strangers to it: They had other Ways to improve that Mirth which was &s;o natural to them. <HI>Anacreon</HI> and <HI>Ari&s;to|phanes</HI> write in a Way where <HI>Turns</HI> are a Beau|ty, and yet it is very difficult to find &s;o much as one Expre&s;&s;ion of that Sort in their Works. <HI>Homer, He&s;iod, Theocritus,</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;aeus,</HI> have no|thing like it in their Poems. It &s;eems to have begun at <HI>Rome,</HI> when <HI>Epigrams</HI> became the common Entertainment of their be&s;t People. After Supper, or over a Bottle in a cool Re|treat, it was their Cu&s;tom to divert one ano|ther with reciting or compo&s;ing three or four <HI>Di&s;tichs,</HI> that were u&s;ually pointed with one of the&s;e Turns, in which they were &s;mart upon &s;ome of the reigning Coxcombs, Coquets, or Humours of that Age.

<P>THE Hours to me are Ages of Mi&s;ery; they mu&s;t be in&s;upportable to a Wretch who can never know what Joy is but in her Pre&s;ence. Love may well be defined a re&s;tle&s;s Impatience to be with tho&s;e we adore. What a mi&s;erable Con&s;traint then mu&s;t I live under, who make it my Bu&s;ine&s;s to avoid the Mi&s;tre&s;s of my Soul? Where my Heart, my Wi&s;hes, my Thoughts are eternally, there I mu&s;t never be. Did &s;he but know what I &s;uffer, and how much a Di&s;cretion as exact as mine makes one mi&s;erable; but alas! they mu&s;t love like me that are to gue&s;s at my Torments. I hardly know I live, but by what I endure for her. O! Nothing can touch my Soul; there is no Har|mony
<PB N="259" REF="262">
in Words, unle&s;s &s;he &s;peaks-them; there is no Bli&s;s, but in her Smile; no Terror, but in her Frown; nothing worth living for, but her E&s;teem. There is this Comfort in an Af|fliction like mine, no other Thing can give me a Moment's Unea&s;ine&s;s. She prevents all other Grief, &s;he prevents all other Plea&s;ure. If the whole World &s;hould change its Place, and &s;he not concerned, I &s;hould hardly perceive it. Whether Peace or War, what Party prevails, who&s;e Ruin is near, all the&s;e Things are now indifferent, they employ not my Thoughts. My only Impatience is to increa&s;e her good Opinion, my only Care not to forfeit her E&s;teem. This Thought brings me into one of tho&s;e terrible Fits of Fear which often &s;eize them that adore her. I know I am not in po&s;itive Di&s;obedience; and a little Equivocation, if &s;o much practi&s;ed in Religion, may be indulged in Love. I nei|ther write nor &s;end to her; I dare not di&s;obey. Sure if there be any Thing like a Fault in this, I am &s;afe. Who is it is to accu&s;e? Who is guilty? And I hope I may &s;ay, What is the Crime? This Letter is &s;ent to you, meant to her, and it came from him; but, Who are the&s;e? In this Dre&s;s, it is to every Body, it is to no Body. How will you draw up my In|dictment? However let me not be condemn'd unaccus'd, unheard; &s;ave me from being cri|minal, if you can think me &s;o.

I lov'd the Spring from whence &s;he came, and my Soul follows the enticing Stream with Plea|&s;ure. I knew there mu&s;t be Wit and Fire be|fore I heard &s;o, and I found more than was &s;poken of. Thus I was &s;truck by Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and the Poi&s;on fir&s;t in&s;tilled into my Heart be|fore I &s;aw or knew her, can never be removed from thence by all that I &s;hall ever &s;ee or know. I would not profane a Confe&s;&s;ion as &s;incere as ever was a dying Man's with the lea&s;t Aug|mentation of Truth. I will not pretend that I have not endeavoured to remove, by any other Object, a Stroke of Fate (as I may call it) that has given and will give me &s;uch Unea&s;ine&s;s.
