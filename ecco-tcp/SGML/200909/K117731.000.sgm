<HEAD>To the Gentlemen, Clergy, Freeholders, and other Inhabitants, of the</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE la&s;t general meeting of the County of York having adopted a propo&s;ition <Q><HI>to &s;horten the duration of parliament to a term not exceeding three years,</HI></Q> the worthy gentlemen of your own committee may probably have been induced, by the laudable de&s;ire of pre&s;erving <HI>unanimity</HI> with that re&s;pecta|ble county, to recommend the &s;ame pro|po&s;ition for your adoption. Be plea&s;ed, therefore, previou&s;ly to con&s;ider, whe|ther it is probable that a majority of the freeholders, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the York&s;hire meet|ing did really mean to prefer <HI>triennial elections</HI> to the ancient legal u&s;age and con&s;titution of <HI>annual parliaments,</HI> or whether they may not rather have been induced to po&s;tpone the open declara|tion of their <HI>loyal</HI> attachment to that an|cient <HI>law</HI> for frequent parliaments, <HI>(viz.
<PB N="4" REF="3">
every year once, and more often if need be,)</HI> merely through a de&s;ire to pre&s;erve the <HI>unanimity</HI> of their <HI>own meeting,</HI> by yield|ing a little, for the pre&s;ent, to the preju|dices of a few particular gentlemen a|mong them, (per&s;ons, indeed, of great worth and e&s;teem, in many re&s;pects, and who&s;e &s;entiments in general de&s;erve the utmo&s;t attention and regard, but) who unhappily, in this point, are apt to conceive, that <HI>annual</HI> elections, and <Q><HI>more often if need be,</HI></Q> would be attended with &s;ome inconveniences to <HI>them&s;elves.</HI></P>
<P>You have undoubtedly, in your own county, al&s;o, &s;everal worthy gentlemen of fortune, to whom great re&s;pect is due from <HI>the people,</HI> on account of their known independence, and &s;teady oppo|&s;ition to bad mea&s;ures in general, who neverthele&s;s, perhaps, may entertain <HI>the &s;ame erroneous conceptions of frequent e|lections;</HI> and therefore you can, by your own feelings, (I mean your re&s;pect and
<PB N="5" REF="4">
e&s;teem for &s;uch worthy men,) more ea|&s;ily judge of <HI>the effect</HI> which the &s;ame kind of laudable influence mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily have cau&s;ed in the York&s;hire meet|ing; which is the be&s;t rea&s;on, I believe, that can be a&s;&s;igned for their having adopted that <HI>uncon&s;titutional</HI> mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>You are therefore mo&s;t earne&s;tly re|que&s;ted to con&s;ider the following plain propo&s;itions.</P>
<P N="1">I. That, though great deference and re&s;pect be certainly due to &s;uch worthy and independent gentlemen as I have de&s;cribed, yet your conde&s;cen&s;ion to them ought to have &s;ome <HI>due limitation.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. That the bounds of the <HI>ancient parliamentary con&s;titution</HI> of the king|dom ought &s;urely to mark out <HI>the ut|mo&s;t extent</HI> of your compliance with the worthy part of the <HI>ari&s;tocratical intere&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. That if, on the contrary, your endeavours to pre&s;erve UNANIMITY
<PB N="6" REF="5">
&s;hould carry you <HI>beyond the&s;e legal bounds,</HI> you will really injure tho&s;e very gentle|men whom you wi&s;h to oblige, as well as the whole <HI>ari&s;tocratical intere&s;t</HI> (the crown, the lords, the country gentle|men in general); becau&s;e there is but <HI>one true common intere&s;t,</HI> which <HI>the fun|damental laws of the con&s;titution alone can pre&s;erve.</HI> Con&s;ider al&s;o,</P>
<P N="4">IV. That <HI>unanimity</HI> is as <HI>baneful</HI> in a bad mea&s;ure as it is <HI>&s;alutary</HI> in a good one: and,</P>
<P N="5">V. That, if any <HI>compliance</HI> in proceed|ings is to be made at all <Q><HI>for the &s;ake of unanimity,</HI></Q> it ought certainly to be made where a <HI>compliance is mo&s;t due;</HI> viz. to the <HI>con&s;titutional re&s;olutions</HI> of a &s;elect body of intelligent gentlemen, <HI>deputed to a national conference,</HI> by freely-elected committees from a very con&s;iderable pro|portion of the counties and mo&s;t populous cities and towns in England;&mdash;to re&s;olu|tions, which were <HI>unanimou&s;ly</HI> agreed upon by the &s;aid <HI>deputies;</HI> and, therefore,
<PB N="7" REF="6">
<HI>"a compliance, for the &s;ake of unanimity,"</HI> was mo&s;t ju&s;tly due to <HI>them;</HI> and, the more e&s;pecially, as it appears that they formed their conclu&s;ions by the funda|mental laws and u&s;ages of the con&s;titu|tion. <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">The deputies, in their memorial, declare, that <Q><HI>&s;hortening the duration of the &s;itting of parliament can only be done,</HI> CONSISTENTLY WITH THE CONSTITUTION, <HI>or with the be&s;t policy in any enlarged view,</HI> BY SHORT|ENING IT TO THE PERIOD OF A YEAR.</Q> And this they farther explain in the words of the old &s;tatutes, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q><HI>that a parliament &s;hould be holden</HI> ONCE <HI>every year, and</HI> MORE OFTEN <HI>if need be;</HI></Q> from whence it is manife&s;t, that <HI>the longe&s;t duration, con&s;i&s;tent with the con&s;titution, is the period of one &s;ingle &s;e&s;&s;ion,</HI> even though two or more &s;uch &s;e&s;&s;ions &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary in <HI>one</HI> or <HI>the &s;ame</HI> year.</NOTE> The &s;triking, &s;imilarity al&s;o of <HI>this deputation,</HI> in many re&s;pects, to an anci|ent example of a <HI>national deputation</HI> from all the counties, cited, on this occa&s;ion, by lord Carysfort,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 15 of his lord&s;hip's very judicious and <HI>loyal</HI> letter to the committee of the county of Huntingdon.</NOTE> from Hoveden, adds great weight to the re&s;olutions in que&s;|tion, as well as to the importance of that <HI>unanimity</HI> with which they were formed.</P>
<P N="6">VI. That the members of the late depu|tation have <HI>unanimou&s;ly</HI> declared, in their
<PB N="8" REF="7">
memorial, that <Q><HI>annual parliaments</HI> are the <HI>ancient con&s;titution</HI> of this kingdom, and the <HI>birthright of Engli&s;hmen;</HI></Q> and, in the three la&s;t paragraphs of their <HI>memo|rial,</HI> which are highly worthy your mo&s;t careful attention, have not only proved that the old <HI>laws,</HI> requiring <Q>a par|liament to be holden every year once, and more often if need be,</Q> meant a <HI>new</HI> parliament <HI>every year, &amp;c.</HI> (by the in&s;tan|ces of writs i&s;&s;ued <Q>two or three times in the &s;ame year, for new elections,</Q>) but they al&s;o prove, from the experience of former ages, that the&s;e <HI>very frequent elec|tions</HI> were <HI>not</HI> attended with any &s;uch in|conveniences, as the advocates for long parliaments commonly pretend, but, on the contrary, recommend them, <HI>"as con&s;i&s;tent with the greate&s;t peace," &amp;c.</HI>&mdash;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>The fact is, (&s;ay the deputies from the &s;everal peti|tioning counties, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) during the whole of that reign, (king Edw. III.) and for the fir&s;t eighteen years of the following one, writs were annually i&s;&s;ued, and, in &s;ome in&s;tances, two or three times in the &s;ame year, for new elections, till Richard II. made him&s;elf ab&s;olute. And various were the occa&s;ions, in tho&s;e times, when the commons gave for an&s;wer, to any new propo&s;itions of magnitude, that THEY DARED NOT AGREE WITH|OUT CONFERENCE WITH THEIR COUNTRIES. At what period then was it, that the con&s;ent of the people was a&s;ked and obtained to &s;o momentous a propo&s;al as that of dive&s;ting them of their expected controul over their repre&s;entatives? in fact, of changing the terms on which the delegation had pa&s;&s;ed from their hands? AN|NUAL PARLIAMENTS are, therefore, the ANCIENT CONSTITUTION of England, and the BIRTHRIGHT of Engli&s;hmen.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Nor are they le&s;s beneficial in policy than unalienable in right. In the language of ancient times, before the prejudices of habit had thrown fal&s;e colours over names and things, <HI>they were ever de&s;cribed as con&s;i&s;tent with the greate&s;t peace, and mo&s;t peaceably conducted.</HI> And, in par|liamentary records, for more than two hundred years together, from 49 Hen. III. till 22 Edw. IV. we find not &s;o much as <HI>one</HI> double return, nor more than two or three in&s;tances of elections que&s;tioned on any ground;&mdash; a circum&s;tance &s;urely mo&s;t inviting, when put in contra&s;t with that multitude of perplexing enquiries which, of late years, hath con&s;umed &s;o much time in committees, to the great hindrance of the national bu&s;ine&s;s. The plain rea&s;on is founded not in the time, but in the na|ture, of the thing; the duration of the &s;eat was not an object for a violent conte&s;t. This will al&s;o di&s;pel the objection ari&s;ing from the probability of tumult and ex|pen&s;ivene&s;s; to remove which it will farther contribute not a little, if we would give attention to what pa&s;&s;es now among tho&s;e large bodies of electors, who annual|ly choo&s;e their corporate officers. But the argument a|gain&s;t corruption &s;urmounts every thing el&s;e. Nothing can give &s;o much a&s;&s;urance of defeating it as this limita|tion. A &s;eat for three years might induce a man's at|tention to a bribe. He that &s;its but for one is very un|likely to experience &s;uch an offer, or will certainly re|ject it, if he would not wi&s;h to put all his future expec|tations to an imminent ri&s;que.</Q></P>
<P><Q>When once the con&s;titution of parliament is improved in the&s;e leading points, every thing el&s;e, that may ap|pear to have its &s;hare in reformation, mu&s;t be &s;ubordi|nate in its cla&s;s, and mu&s;t follow in its time. And, the more effectually to in&s;ure the&s;e, we entreat you, nei|ther at the next or any future election, to engage your &s;upport to any candidate, before you are &s;atisfied that he will give his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in parliament, to the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of &s;o much of the&s;e reforms as may not then be accompli&s;hed.</Q></P></NOTE>
<PB N="9" REF="8">
And, therefore, you are de&s;ired to con&s;i|der,</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="10" REF="9">VII. That the York&s;hire propo&s;ition for &s;hortening <Q>the duration of parlia|ments to a term, not exceeding three years,</Q> is totally different from the <HI>&s;hortening of duration,</HI> explained and re|commended by the &s;aid deputies, as <Q>the ancient con&s;titution of the kingdom, and the birthright of Engli&s;hmen;</Q> and, what is wor&s;e, has been adopted without the lea&s;t mention of that <HI>birthright</HI> in any &s;aving clau&s;e, to a&s;&s;ert and pre&s;erve your ju&s;t claim to it for a <HI>future</HI> time: where|by it is manife&s;t, that the promoters of this <HI>triennial</HI> &s;cheme have really been <HI>the fir&s;t
<PB N="11" REF="10">
offenders</HI> again&s;t that de&s;irable <HI>unanimity,</HI> which the conference of deputies was in|tended to effect; and, therefore, the cry of <HI>"nece&s;&s;ary unanimity,"</HI> by which alone that <HI>uncon&s;titutional</HI> propo&s;ition is at pre|&s;ent recommended, de&s;erves not the lea&s;t attention. What! would you be <HI>unani|mous</HI> again&s;t the ancient legal parliamen|tary con&s;titution of the kingdom, which the <HI>triennial</HI> &s;cheme is manife&s;tly calcu|lated to &s;upplant? You ought never to forget,</P>
<P N="8">VIII. That the people have already been betrayed by a <HI>triennial</HI> parliament! That the <HI>repre&s;entatives</HI> of the people, in a <HI>triennial</HI> parliament, u&s;urped the le|gi&s;lative authority of their con&s;tituents for a longer time than it was delegated; and treacherou&s;ly pre&s;umed, <Q>without con|&s;ulting their countries,</Q> to prolong the duration of parliaments to the pre&s;ent unrea&s;onable term of <HI>&s;even</HI> years; where|by
<PB N="12" REF="11">
by they e&s;tabli&s;hed the ba&s;is of that de|te&s;table &s;y&s;tem of corruption which has been the true &s;ource of all your pre&s;ent grievances! And, therefore, be plea&s;ed to con&s;ider, &mdash;</P>
<P N="9">IX. That <HI>triennial</HI> parliaments, as well as <HI>&s;eptennial,</HI> are manife&s;tly dangerous to the &s;tate, and &s;o gro&s;&s;ly incon&s;i&s;tent with the ancient legal parliamentary con|&s;titution of this kingdom, that the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential <HI>laws</HI> and <HI>u&s;ages,</HI> by which that con&s;titution is declared and known, are really <HI>&s;u&s;pended</HI> by them. You cannot, therefore, without notorious <HI>di&s;loyalty,</HI> (in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word,) adopt the propo&s;ition for <HI>triennial</HI> parliaments: &s;o that you have a mo&s;t ample excu&s;e for not concurring with a few particular gentle|men, (whom you would otherwi&s;e wi&s;h to oblige,) <HI>viz.</HI> that your <HI>compliance</HI> with them, in this matter would exceed the <HI>con&s;tituti|onal</HI> bounds of conde&s;cen&s;ion, (mentioned
<PB N="13" REF="12">
in the three fir&s;t propo&s;itions,) and would really tend to &s;ubvert the people's ju&s;t right <HI>to more frequent elections.</HI> &mdash; Be|cau&s;e it is manife&s;t, &mdash;</P>
<P N="10">X. That the <HI>conce&s;&s;ion</HI> of a popular right, made by the people them&s;elves in their collective capacity, at their &s;everal county-meetings, is infinitely more bind|ing upon them (to exclude any future claim to the ceded right) than the &s;ame <HI>conce&s;&s;ion</HI> would be, if made merely by their <HI>repre&s;entatives</HI> in parliament, with|out the in&s;truction or concurrence of the people. And, therefore, you ought to be particularly thankful, &mdash;</P>
<P N="11">XI. That the people them&s;elves, the great body of con&s;tituents, have never yet, by any &s;uch <HI>conce&s;&s;ion,</HI> betrayed that valuable <HI>birthright,</HI> (as the deputies call it,) the ancient <HI>law</HI> for <HI>annual</HI> parlia|ments. It has too often been <HI>&s;u&s;pended</HI> indeed; &s;ometimes through the <HI>di&s;loyalty</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="13">
of kings, and la&s;tly even by the <HI>di&s;loyalty</HI> of parliament it&s;elf, (of which the tyran|nical <HI>triennial</HI> and <HI>&s;eptennial</HI> acts are la|mentable in&s;tances); yet, as the <HI>&s;u&s;pen|&s;ion</HI> of it has never been promoted by the requi&s;ition or in&s;truction of the peo|ple at large, their right to it remains in|tire. The pre&s;umption and treachery of their repre&s;entatives, in con&s;enting to the <HI>triennial</HI> and <HI>&s;eptennial</HI> acts, cannot in|jure their ju&s;t title to it; becau&s;e, in both the&s;e in&s;tances, the repre&s;entatives pre|&s;umed to act contrary to an e&s;tabli&s;hed rule of parliament, by adopting a <HI>new device,</HI> (which even affected a fundamen|tal law of the kingdom,) <Q>without con|&s;ulting their countries,</Q> which the con|&s;titution ab&s;olutely requires in &s;uch an important ca&s;e; &s;o that even that unwar|rantable pre&s;umption of the repre&s;enta|tives (in neglecting to con&s;ult the people) is the very circum&s;tance which &s;till pre|&s;erves
<PB N="15" REF="14">
that fundamental and e&s;&s;ential law <HI>as a part of the con&s;titution,</HI> and as a ju&s;t right of the people, which they are en|titled to demand and re&s;ume whenever they &s;hall be plea&s;ed to in&s;truct their re|pre&s;entatives for that purpo&s;e; and to charge all per&s;ons with <HI>di&s;loyalty,</HI> and e|ven <HI>trea&s;on to the con&s;titution,</HI> who &s;hall dare to oppo&s;e them! But if, on the contrary, the <HI>people them&s;elves, in their &s;everal county-courts,</HI> or <HI>a&s;&s;emblies,</HI> &s;hould be &s;o incon&s;iderate, or &s;o depraved, as to con&s;ent indi&s;criminately to the propo&s;i|tion for a <HI>triennial</HI> election, without a &s;a|ving clau&s;e to a&s;&s;ert their <HI>birthright</HI> and re&s;erve their title to more frequent elec|tions, (which the York&s;hire meeting has unwarily done,) know, for a certainty,&mdash;</P>
<P N="12">XII. That, in &s;uch an unhappy inat|tention to their own rights, (which, I pray to God, they may never be cur&s;ed with,) they would <HI>betray</HI> the con&s;titution
<PB N="16" REF="15">
of the kingdom! &mdash; they would betray a fundamental <HI>law</HI> of their ance&s;tors; which would mark their character with an eternal &s;tain of <HI>di&s;loyalty!</HI> And as they may, perhaps, never have again &s;o fa|vourable an opportunity, as the pre&s;ent, of recovering their ancient birthright of <HI>annual elections,</HI> it would probably be lo&s;t, irretrievably lo&s;t, for ever! Your new triennial repre&s;entatives (in &s;uch a ca&s;e) would mo&s;t likely behave as former triennial repre&s;entatives have heretofore done, &mdash; <HI>betray and en&s;lave you by another &s;eptennial &s;y&s;tem of corruption!</HI> And (what is wor&s;e) you your&s;elves would <HI>mo&s;t ju&s;tly de&s;erve it!</HI></P>
<P>But I hope better things of you; and I tru&s;t al&s;o that you will excu&s;e the &s;eve|rity of my expre&s;&s;ions in this addre&s;s, as being prompted merely by an ardent zeal for your pro&s;perity.</P>
