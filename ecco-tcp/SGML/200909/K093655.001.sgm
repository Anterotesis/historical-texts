<P>SPAIN has given birth to &s;o many eminent Painters, of whom there is no memorial in the re&s;t of Europe, and abounds with &s;o many admirable examples of their art, di&s;per&s;ed in churches, convents and palaces, where the curio&s;ity of modern travellers rare|ly carries them, that I per&s;uade

my&s;elf it will not be unacceptable to the public to have &s;ome ac|count of men and works &s;o little known and yet &s;o highly worthy to be recorded. I am not aware that this has been profe&s;&s;edly at|tempted by any Spani&s;h writer, except by <HI>Palomino;</HI> who in an elaborate treati&s;e on the Art of Painting, in two folio volumes, has in&s;erted the lives of two hun|dred and thirty-three Painters and Sculptors, who flori&s;hed in Spain from the time of <HI>Ferdinand the Catholic</HI> to the conclu&s;ion of the reign of <HI>Philip the Fourth;</HI> of the&s;e materials I have principally availed my&s;elf in the following &s;heets, but not without due attention to other authorities, that interpo&s;e accounts

differing from his, or extend to particulars, which he has failed to enumerate. He is &s;aid to have written with a competent know|ledge of his &s;ubject, as an art, of which he was him&s;elf a profe&s;&s;or; and in rules for the practice of painting he is very diffu&s;ive: If he had been more communicative or entertaining in tho&s;e matters, for which I chiefly con&s;ulted him, I might have needed le&s;s apology for the pre&s;ent publication: Many particulars however have been furni&s;hed to me from tradition, which help out the &s;terility and dryne&s;s of his catalogue; and I mu&s;t not omit to acknowledge the a&s;&s;i&s;tance I drew from the treati&s;e of <HI>Pacheco,</HI> a book now become

extremely rare and hardly to be obtained. I know there was an Engli&s;h abridgement of Palomi|no's Painters publi&s;hed in the year 1739, but the original is in very few hands; &s;o that, unle&s;s &s;ome Spani&s;h biographer &s;hall &s;peedily be found with public &s;pirit to en|gage in the ta&s;k of re&s;cuing the fame of his ingenious country|men from approaching extinction, their hi&s;tories at lea&s;t will &s;oon be lo&s;t, whatever may be the fate of their works. The world is in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of many memoirs of the ar|ti&s;ts of Italy, France and Flan|ders; and the Painters, who di&s;|tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in England, have by happy fortune found a biographer, who&s;e entertaining ta|lents
<PB N="5" REF="9">
will &s;ecure to them a recep|tion with po&s;terity; whil&s;t of all the Painters, to who&s;e memory I have dedicated this &s;light at|tempt, &s;carce a name is heard without the limits of Spain, ex|cept tho&s;e of <HI>Vela&s;quez, Murillo,</HI> and <HI>Ribeira:</HI> The paintings of the latter it is true are very gene|rally known, many excellent per|formances of his being di&s;per&s;ed through Europe: Some re&s;pecta|ble remains of <HI>Vela&s;quez</HI> are to be found in Italy, but the principal exertions of his pencil were re&s;er|ved for his own country, and the Sovereign, who entertained him in his &s;ervice; the&s;e, we may natu|rally &s;uppo&s;e, can never be ex|tracted: And as for <HI>Murillo,</HI> al|though
<PB N="6" REF="10">
&s;ome pieces of his have in time pa&s;t been extracted from Se|ville, yet I think I may venture to &s;ay, that not many of them, which pa&s;s under his name, are legiti|mate; and in a le&s;s proportion can we find among&s;t &s;uch, as are true pictures, any of &s;o capital a rank, as to impart a competent idea of his extraordinary merit.</P>
<P>The candid reader will ob&s;erve, that I do not profe&s;s to give the Lives of the Painters, who are treated of in this catalogue, for which my materials do not &s;uffice; nor &s;hall I hazard many critici&s;ms upon their re&s;pective works, for which more &s;cience would be re|qui&s;ite than I can pretend to; &s;till I hope there will be &s;ound &s;uffi|cient
<PB N="7" REF="11">
novelty to amu&s;e &s;uch of my readers, as can endure to hear of paintings, as they &s;trike the feelings of an ordinary ob&s;erver, without pre&s;uming to di&s;&s;ect them in the learned jargon of a Virtuo&s;o: It will be remembered therefore that I offer nothing more to the public than Anecdotes of the Eminent Painters, who have flo|ri&s;hed in Spain during the two centuries la&s;t pa&s;t; and in this de|&s;cription I include all &s;uch illu&s;|trious foreigners, as have re&s;orted to Spain for the di&s;play of their talents under protection of the Princes or Nobles of that king|dom; the&s;e are a pretty numerous cla&s;s, and in treating of them, I &s;hall &s;tudy to avoid repeating
<PB N="8" REF="12">
what may have been better told by others; but even of the&s;e per|haps &s;ome local anecdotes will occur, which may at lea&s;t be &s;up|plementary to the accounts al|ready in exi&s;tence. My re&s;idence in Spain, and &s;ome advantages in|cident to my peculiar &s;ituation there, gave me repeated acce&s;s to every thing I wi&s;hed to &s;ee; al|mo&s;t every religious foundation throughout the kingdom contains a magazine of art; in re&s;orting to the&s;e nothing will be found, of which a &s;tranger can complain, unle&s;s of the gloomine&s;s of &s;ome of the edifices, and the unfavour|able lights, in which many capi|tal paintings are di&s;po&s;ed: In pri|vate hou&s;es it is not unu&s;ual to
<PB N="9" REF="13">
di&s;cover very fine pictures in neg|lect and decay; thrown a&s;ide among&s;t the rubbi&s;h of ca&s;t-off furniture; whether it be, that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or has no knowledge of their excellence, or thinks it be|low his notice to attend to their pre&s;ervation; but how much &s;o|ever the Spaniards have declined from their former ta&s;te and pa&s;|&s;ion for the elegant arts, I am per&s;uaded they have in no degree fallen off from their national cha|racter for genero&s;ity, which is &s;till &s;o prevalent among&s;t them, that a &s;tranger, who is intere&s;tedly di&s;|po&s;ed to avail him&s;elf of their munificence, may in a great mea&s;ure obtain whatever is the object of his prai&s;e and admira|tion:

As for the royal collections at Madrid, the E&s;corial and el&s;e|where, he will meet a conde&s;cen|&s;ion &s;o accommodated to his cu|rio&s;ity, that the one is as little likely to be exhau&s;ted as the other; the facility of acce&s;s to every palace in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of His Catholic Maje&s;ty is only to be equalled by the gratification it produces.</P>

<P>THE Arts, which revived in Italy during the 14th century, did not reach Spain till the time of <HI>Ferdinand the Catholic; Antonio Del Rincon,</HI> a native of <HI>Guadalax|ara,</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="15">
may be con&s;idered as the fa|ther of the Spani&s;h &s;chool; he &s;tudied in Rome, and, returning to his native country, was taken into the &s;ervice of <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> who be&s;towed on him the Order of <HI>Santiago,</HI> and made him Groom of his Chamber. There are two por|traits of <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> painted by him, &s;till to be &s;een at <HI>Toledo,</HI> in the church of <HI>San Juan de los Reyes,</HI> and &s;everal pictures by his hand peri&s;hed in the fire, that de&s;troyed the palace of the <HI>Pardo</HI> in the year 1608. This ar|ti&s;t died in the year 1500.</P>
<P>The unhappy cata&s;trophe of <HI>Torrigiano,</HI> the Florentine, follow|ed in the year 1522: After having enriched the cities of <HI>Andalu&s;ia</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="16">
with &s;everal pieces of &s;culpture, not unworthy the di&s;ciple and ri|val of <HI>Michael Angelo;</HI> he was condemned to death by the In|qui&s;ition, and expired in the pri|&s;on of <HI>Seville</HI> under the horrors of an approaching execution: The &s;tory is as follows; <HI>Torrigiano</HI> had undertaken to carve a Madona and child of the natural &s;ize, at the order of a certain Spani&s;h Gran|dee; it was to be made after the model of one, which he had al|ready executed; and promi&s;e was given him of a reward propor|tioned to the merit of his work. His employer was one of the fir&s;t Grandees of Spain, and <HI>Torrigi|ano,</HI> who conceived highly of his genero&s;ity, and well knew what
<PB N="13" REF="17">
his own talents could perform, was determined to outdo his for|mer work; he had pa&s;&s;ed great part of his life in travelling from kingdom to kingdom in &s;earch of employment, and, flattering him|&s;elf with the hope, that he had now at la&s;t found a re&s;ting-place after all his labours, the ingenious arti&s;t with much pains and appli|cation compleated the work, and pre&s;ented to his employer a matchle&s;s piece of &s;culpture, the utmo&s;t effort of his art; the Gran|dee &s;urveyed the &s;triking perfor|mance with great delight and re|verence; applauded <HI>Torrigiano</HI> to the &s;kies; and, impatient to po&s;|&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of the enchanting idol, forthwith &s;ent to demand it;
<PB N="14" REF="18">
at the &s;ame time, to &s;et off his genero&s;ity with a better di&s;play, he loaded two lacqueys with the money, that was to defray the purcha&s;e; the bulk at lea&s;t was promi&s;ing, but when <HI>Torrigiano</HI> turned out the bags, and found the &s;pecie nothing better than a parcel of bra&s;s maravedi, amount|ing only to the paltry &s;um of thir|ty ducats, vexation at this &s;udden di&s;appointment of his hopes, and ju&s;t re&s;entment for what he con|&s;idered as an in&s;ult to his merit, &s;o tran&s;ported him, that, &s;natch|ing up his mallet in a rage, and not regarding the perfection, or (what to him was of more fatal con&s;equence) the &s;acred character of the image he had made; he
<PB N="15" REF="19">
broke it &s;uddenly in pieces, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the lacqueys with their load of farthings to tell the tale: They executed their errand too well. The Grandee in his turn fired with &s;hame, vexation and revenge, and a&s;&s;uming, or per|haps conceiving, horror for the &s;acrilegious nature of the act, pre|&s;ented him&s;elf before the Court of Inqui&s;ition, and impeached the unhappy arti&s;t at that terrible tri|bunal; it was in vain that poor <HI>Torrigiano</HI> urged the right of an author over his own creation; Rea&s;on pleaded on his &s;ide, but Super&s;tition &s;ate in judgement; the decree was death with torture. The Holy Office lo&s;t its victim; for <HI>Torrigiano</HI> expired under the hor|rors,
<PB N="16" REF="20">
not under the hands of the executioner: That he was of a fierce impatient &s;pirit we may well believe from what is related of his maiming the great <HI>Michael Angelo</HI> by a violent blow on the &s;ace; the heretical reader perhaps will think this blow a more in|excu&s;able, offence, than that, for which he &s;uffered; and an enthu|&s;ia&s;t in the arts will &s;carce lament the puni&s;hment, which by a ju&s;t tran&s;ition fell upon him; for my part, I lament both his offence and his puni&s;hment; the man, who could be &s;o frantic with pa&s;|&s;ion, as in the per&s;on of <HI>Michael Angelo</HI> to deface one of the di|vine&s;t works of heaven, might ea&s;ily be tempted to demoli&s;h his
<PB N="17" REF="21">
own; and it has been generally ob&s;erved, that hearts, &s;o prone to anger, have on occa&s;ion been as &s;u&s;ceptible of apprehen&s;ion and fear; it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that <HI>Torrigiano</HI>'s ca&s;e was not better in the eyes of the Holy Office for his having been re&s;ident in England and employed by King <HI>Henry the Eighth:</HI> Whether they con&s;idered him as tinctured with the here&s;y of that Royal apo&s;tate does not ap|pear; I am inclined to believe he more re&s;embled Henry in temper than in opinion: At lea&s;t, if we are to credit his a&s;&s;ault on <HI>Michael Angelo</HI> and try him on that ac|tion; &s;ince the days of Diomed few mortals ever launched a more impious blow.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="22">
The arts, being thus tran&s;|planted from Italy into Spain, found a ready naturalization in a country, then abounding with ge|nius: The province of Andalu|&s;ia took the lead on this occa&s;ion, and has in all times been produc|tive of extraordinary talents; it was the cradle of mo&s;t of the Spa|ni&s;h painters; it's natives conti|nue to be remarked for quick and volatile parts, differing much in manners and di&s;po&s;ition from the Ca&s;tilians. Certain it is that Spain has many local qualifications for becoming a nur&s;ery of Painters, which other countries are in want o&s;: It enjoys a clear and vivid &s;ky, with a dry and healthy air, fa|vourable to the pre&s;ervation if not
<PB N="19" REF="23">
to the production of works of art; the human countenance there is in general of a grave hi&s;torical ca&s;t; the intermixture of the Jewi&s;h and Moori&s;h tribes have marked the lower cla&s;&s;es with a &s;trong peculi|arity of features; the forms of the children, till they attain the age of eight or ten, are good, and of|tentimes their faces beautiful; the eyes of the women black and piercing, and, as they u&s;e much action when they conver&s;e, and are univer&s;ally addicted to the Moor|i&s;h modes of dancing, which al|mo&s;t every pea&s;ant can accom|pany with his voice and in&s;tru|ment, their groupes become ex|tremely picture&s;que: To the&s;e may be added the character of their
<PB N="20" REF="24">
dre&s;s, particularly that of Anda|lu&s;ia, which both in male and fe|male is uncommonly antique and graceful; the cloak alone may be folded twenty different ways for different applications, and each attitude pre&s;ents a &s;pecimen of drapery worthy the &s;tudy of an academy. The Painters have a|vailed them&s;elves of this, Italians as well as natives, and the <HI>Capa</HI> will be found frequently upon their canva&s;&s;es, even where the &s;cene does not lie in Spain. In &s;peaking of Spain, as a country favourable to Painters, I think it is ju&s;t to except painters of land|&s;capes; in the&s;e it has neither ex|celled nor abounded; and the ge|neral want of trees and verdure
<PB N="21" REF="25">
readily &s;upplies a rea&s;on: Groves and rivers and &s;cattered habita|tions, emblematic of rural tranquil|lity, which furni&s;h the mo&s;t plea&s;|ing &s;ubjects to the imagination of the &s;ceni&s;t, are there but thinly &s;pread; the face of Nature is adu&s;t and frowning.</P>
<P>The Emperor <HI>Charles,</HI> though not very cordially attached to his Spani&s;h &s;ubjects, nor over partial to their country, cultivated not|with&s;tanding the genius of their Painters; and this he effected not only by &s;ending them to &s;tudy under the Italian ma&s;ters, but al&s;o by inviting the Italian ma&s;ters in|to Spain; the fertile genius of <HI>Titiano</HI> might have been alone &s;ufficient to illuminate a kingdom,
<PB N="22" REF="26">
and there were many others in the like employ; <HI>Julio</HI> and <HI>Alexan|dro,</HI> Italians of the &s;chool of <HI>Juan de Udine,</HI> a di&s;ciple of <HI>Ra|fael,</HI> were arti&s;ts of great emi|nence; <HI>Charles</HI> employed them in a royal work, the beautifying the Alhambra of Grenada; they en|riched the Ho&s;pital of <HI>Santiago,</HI> in the city of <HI>Ubeda,</HI> with many no|ble paintings, and the famous Duke of Alva found employment for their talents.</P>
<P><HI>Alon&s;o Berruguete,</HI> a Ca&s;tilian, educated in the &s;chool of the great <HI>Michael Angelo,</HI> the friend and contemporary of <HI>Andrea del Sarto, Bachio Bandinello</HI> and others, re|turned into Spain an eminent proficient in painting, &s;culpture
<PB N="23" REF="27">
and architecture; deeply &s;killed in the theory of his art, he exhi|bited to the world a new &s;y&s;tem of human &s;ymmetry and propor|tion, differing at once from the rules of <HI>Pomponio Gaurico, Philipo de Borgona</HI> and <HI>Alberto Durero,</HI> over whom he finally triumphed both in principle and practice; leaving many illu&s;trious monu|ments of his excellence in all the branches of his &s;tudy, both at Madrid, the Pardo and the Al|hambra of Grenada; for which he was &s;uitably honoured and re|warded by the Emperor <HI>Charles,</HI> and died full of years and replete with fame and fortune, in 1545, in the city of Madrid. I &s;hould ob&s;erve in this place, that in the
<PB N="24" REF="28">
choir of the cathedral in <HI>Toledo,</HI> there are an innumerable number of beautiful carvings by <HI>Berru|guete; Philip de Borgona</HI> executed one &s;ide of the choir, and <HI>Berru|guete</HI> the other.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s of this arti&s;t was an encouragement to others, and the &s;chool of <HI>Michael Angelo</HI> was eagerly re&s;orted to by <HI>Bapti&s;ta Bergamo</HI> and <HI>Ga&s;par Becerra,</HI> of <HI>Baiza</HI> in <HI>Andalu&s;ia;</HI> the&s;e illu&s;tri|ous &s;tudents returned together to Spain, and were immediately tak|en into the protection of the Em|peror. The arts, which <HI>Rincon</HI> had tran&s;planted into Spain, which <HI>Berruguete</HI> had &s;o pro&s;per|ou&s;ly advanced, they (but e&s;pe|cially <HI>Becerra</HI>) pu&s;hed into matu|rity;
<PB N="25" REF="29">
this man, who even in Rome (at that period in her zenith) had attracted general admiration, ex|celled in &s;culpture, equally as in painting; in the latter art his mode of colouring, and his ma|nagement in the relief of his fi|gures, greatly improved the prac|tice of the Spani&s;h &s;chool, and taught his countrymen to look upon their fir&s;t manner with con|tempt: As a &s;tatuary, he &s;eems to have found ample field for the exerci&s;e of his talents; the altars now began to wear a different form; in&s;tead of the di&s;torted bar|barous &s;hapes of Gothic ma&s;onry, crucifixes, &s;aints and virgins now took place, in all the grande gu&s;to of <HI>Michael Angelo.</HI> The
<PB N="26" REF="30">
churches of <HI>A&s;torga, Zamora, Burgos</HI> and <HI>Salamanca</HI> contended which &s;hould fir&s;t engage him in their &s;ervice; he executed all the&s;e commi&s;&s;ions to the &s;atisfac|tion of the Fathers, and, when they had equipped his images in wide hoops and furbelowed petti|coats, they applauded the arti&s;t, and adored his manufacture. It was not &s;o ea&s;y to &s;atisfy the ca|price of <HI>I&s;abella</HI> of <HI>Valois;</HI> &s;he commi&s;&s;ioned him to carve a wooden image of our Lady of the <HI>Solidad,</HI> for the convent of <HI>San Franci&s;co de Paulo; Becerra</HI> re|ceived her Maje&s;ty's commands, and addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with dili|gence to the work; after the la|bour of a year he compleated an
<PB N="27" REF="31">
image to his intire &s;atisfaction; he pre&s;ented it to the Queen with an a&s;&s;urance of &s;ucce&s;s, but in vain; his image did not reach the ideas of the Queen; the expre&s;&s;ion did not plea&s;e her; and he was com|manded not only to make a bet|ter, but to take le&s;s time in mak|ing it: He executed his order a &s;econd time, and produced an image to the admiration of all beholders; even the Fathers of the Convent acknowledged it to be a perfect and exact repre&s;enta|tion of nature; it was again &s;ub|mitted to the Queen, and again condemned for falling &s;hort of her Maje&s;ty's conceptions of our Lady of the <HI>Solidad;</HI> the unhappy arti&s;t was threatened to be &s;uper|&s;eded
<PB N="28" REF="32">
in the commi&s;&s;ion by &s;ome abler ma&s;ter; but, anxious to pre|&s;erve his pre-eminence, and ful|fil her Maje&s;ty's ideas, he again applied him&s;elf with ardour to the ta&s;k; he racked his imagination without cea&s;ing to frame &s;ome vi|&s;age, and devi&s;e &s;ome form, that <HI>I&s;abella</HI> might confe&s;s bore a re|&s;emblance to the image in her mind: Wearied out with the tor|menting inve&s;tigation, the ex|hau&s;ted arti&s;t one day fell into a profound &s;leep; whil&s;t this was pa&s;&s;ing, he &s;aw, or thought he &s;aw, a female figure pre&s;enting her&s;elf at the feet of his bed; he looked, in hopes perhaps to have ob|tained a model for his image; but the lady unluckily concealed her
<PB N="29" REF="33">
face; at length, addre&s;&s;ing him in the mo&s;t courteous &s;tile, &s;he de|&s;ired him to open his eyes, get out of bed, and take the log, that he would find burning on his hearth, and &s;et to work upon it, and he would find an image to his mind; <HI>Becerra,</HI> overjoyed, lo&s;t no time in following her advice; he found the log, quenched it; 'twas a convenient piece of timber; and with this &s;upernatural aid com|pleated a figure to the heart's content of <HI>I&s;abella;</HI> the Monks, who&s;e prayers a&s;&s;i&s;ted the execu|tion, received the miraculous image with joy; it was erected on the high altar of the convent in <HI>Valladolid,</HI> with all proper cere|monials fitting the &s;olemnity; it
<PB N="30" REF="34">
was habited in the weeds of Queen <HI>Joanna,</HI> widow of <HI>Philip the Hand&s;ome,</HI> and remains to this day, not indeed a monument of <HI>Becerra</HI>'s art (for no part of that is to be &s;een) but of his pa|tience; and proves, that, however eminent might be his talent for &s;culpture, if it had not been for his faculty of dreaming, he would have made a &s;hameful &s;hipwreck of his fame. Happy had it been for poor <HI>Torrigiano,</HI> if he had had <HI>Becerra</HI>'s di&s;cretion, or <HI>Becerra</HI>'s dreams.</P>
<P><HI>Antonio Flores,</HI> and <HI>Fernando Gallegos</HI> (the one of Seville and the other of Salamanca) were Painters of great merit, and much in the favour of the Emperor,
<PB N="31" REF="35">
particularly the latter; they for|med them&s;elves in the &s;chool of <HI>Alberto Durero,</HI> and <HI>Gallegos</HI> co|pied the manner of his ma&s;ter &s;o clo&s;ely, that many of his pictures cannot be di&s;tingui&s;hed from <HI>Du|rero</HI>'s: Some of his works remain at Salamanca, but mo&s;t of them &s;o impaired by time, and by the cloi&s;ter where they hang, that they are become &s;carce vi&s;ible. Charles the Vth al&s;o brought with him into Spain, out of Italy, the celebrated <HI>Pedro Campana,</HI> a Fle|ming by birth, who had &s;tudied twenty years in the &s;chool of <HI>Ra|fael Urbin:</HI> When Charles made his entry into <HI>Bologna,</HI> in the year 1530, <HI>Pedro Campana</HI> devi&s;ed the grand triumphal arch, under
<PB N="32" REF="36">
which he pa&s;&s;ed: <HI>Campana</HI> &s;oon after came into Spain, re&s;id|ing chiefly at Seville. In the chapel of the Purification in that city there is &s;till to be &s;een a ca|pital painting by this ma&s;ter on the &s;ubject of the ceremony, to which the chapel is dedicated; a De&s;cent from the Cro&s;s and a Nati|vity, both celebrated pictures, are yet to be &s;een in the church of <HI>San Lorenzo;</HI> and in the convent of <HI>San Pablo,</HI> in a &s;mall chapel adjoining to the Chapter-hou&s;e, there is a picture by <HI>Campana</HI> on the &s;ubject of the Circumci&s;ion; all which are much extolled by <HI>Pacheco</HI> in his treati&s;e on the Art of Painting. <HI>Campana</HI> died in the year 1570 at Bru&s;&s;els, where his

<P>It is not to be under&s;tood that all the pictures of <HI>Titiano,</HI> that are in the royal collection, were paint|ed by him, whil&s;t he was King's painter to Charles and to Philip: Many are of his earlier and better age, and were either pre&s;ented to the Crown, or purcha&s;ed in Italy after the death of <HI>Titiano:</HI> An in|&s;tance of this occurred in the ca&s;e

were in &s;ome degree compen&s;ated to him by mo&s;t quick and brilliant &s;en&s;e in the remaining faculties.

recalled him into Spain and ap|pointed him one of his painters at the E&s;corial; after having given &s;ome &s;ketches of Prophets in black and white, in the adornments of the &s;acri&s;ty, as &s;amples of his art, he proceeded to compo&s;itions of greater con&s;equence, and paint|ed the Bapti&s;m of our Saviour in the Prior's cell; he was after that employed in &s;everal paintings for a chapel, which King Philip cau&s;ed to be erected in the wood of Se|govia; the&s;e paintings were re|moved to the upper cloy&s;ter of the E&s;corial, and in one of the&s;e, which repre&s;ents the beheading of Santiago, <HI>El Mudo</HI> has in&s;erted the portrait of Santoyo in the cha|racter of the Executioner, in re|venge
<PB N="72" REF="76">
for &s;ome ill offices, which that mini&s;ter had done him. San|toyo complained to the King, making &s;uit that the figure might be expunged, and his per&s;on not delivered to po&s;terity in the di&s;|graceful occupation of a hangman; the King, who probably knew the cau&s;e of the offence, did not di&s;|approve of the nature of the re|venge, and, excu&s;ing him&s;elf to <HI>Santoyo</HI> on account of the excel|lence of the performance, would not allow the picture to be defaced.

<P><HI>El Divino Morales</HI> was born at Badajoz in the province of E&s;tre|madura, in the beginning of the

&s;ixteenth century. He was in|&s;tructed at Seville in the academy of <HI>Pedro Campana,</HI> a di&s;ciple of <HI>Raphael;</HI> from his con&s;tant choice of divine &s;ubjects and the ex|treme delicacy of his pencil he acquired the appellation of <HI>El Di|vino,</HI> and is known to the pre&s;ent age by no other name than that of <HI>El Divino Morales.</HI> All his paint|ings are upon board or copper, and almo&s;t generally heads of the crucified Saviour; no in&s;tance oc|curring of his having executed any compo&s;ition or figure at full length. His heads are fini&s;hed off with infinite care and laboured to the utmo&s;t, yet not &s;o as to dimi|ni&s;h the force of the expre&s;&s;ion; for I have &s;een &s;ome examples of

his <HI>Ecce Homo</HI> of a mo&s;t exqui&s;ite and touching character; al&s;o &s;ome heads of the Chri&s;t bearing the cro&s;s approaching very near to the Saviour in the famous <HI>Pa&s;mo de Sicilia.</HI> Though <HI>Morales</HI> never fails to impre&s;s the countenance with the deepe&s;t tints of human agony, I never met with any in&s;tance of his doing violence to our ideas of the divinity of the object he re|pre&s;ents: His conception of the countenance &s;eems to be original and his own, more re&s;embling however the face of the Chri&s;t in <HI>Raphael</HI>'s picture above-mention|ed, than any other; and worked, as it appears to me, after the man|ner of the highly-fini&s;hed heads of <HI>Leonardo da Vinci.</HI> He was un|doubtedly

an arti&s;t of a very li|mited invention and de&s;ign; in aerial per&s;pective and the clear|ob&s;cure I have &s;ometimes found him evidently deficient, nor has he any tincture of art or academy in grouping his figures and di&s;|po&s;ing his attitudes; every thing is left to a &s;imple expre&s;&s;ion of af|fecting nature: His <HI>Mater doloro&s;a</HI> is the very extreme of &s;orrow; nor is he anxious to maintain any trace of beauty amid&s;t his expre&s;&s;ions of affliction: I am of opinion that no imagination, which had not been aided by the &s;pectacles of exhau&s;t|ed nature, which a nunnery ex|hibits, could have devi&s;ed an ob|ject &s;o extremely woe-begone: It is in &s;hort the aggravated por|trait

of an emaciated devotee ex|piring in her vigils.

<P><HI>Miguel Barro&s;o,</HI> (a di&s;ciple of <HI>Becerra</HI>) and <HI>Domingo Beltran</HI> the Je&s;uit, a native of Victoria, were men of eminent talents; they were both excellent architects and of

great erudition: The former was employed at the E&s;corial in paint|ing part of the principal cloy&s;ter, the latter, who had formed him|&s;elf in Italy, executed &s;ome &s;ta|tues in the great church of admi|rable workman&s;hip, and in the grande gu&s;to of <HI>Michael Angelo. Beltran</HI> al&s;o carved a cruci&s;ix for the high altar at the Imperial col|lege, lately occupied by the Je|&s;uits at Madrid, a work of infinite merit and expre&s;&s;ion; there is another on the high altar of the college at Alcala de Henares, which I have not &s;een, but which is no le&s;s celebrated: Both the&s;e ingenious arti&s;ts died in the year 1590, both were men of amiable

<P>The &s;ame year was al&s;o fatal to <HI>Teodo&s;io Mingot</HI> the Catalan, (a di&s;|ciple of <HI>Michael Angelo</HI>) and <HI>Luis de Carvajal</HI> of Toledo, both emi|nent painters, and both employed at the E&s;corial: Part of the prin|cipal cloy&s;ter is painted by <HI>Carva|jal,</HI> and among&s;t the paintings in the church &s;pecimens of a re&s;pect|able &s;ort are to be found of both the&s;e ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>But among&s;t the principal ar|ti&s;ts, employed by Philip in the paintings of the E&s;corial, the Elder <HI>Coello</HI> was one in the chief favour and e&s;teem of that &s;ove|reign, who in his letters &s;tiles him <HI>Titiano Portugues</HI> (for he was of

<PB N="87" REF="91">
and Don Rodrigo de Ca&s;tro, archbi&s;hop of Seville: <HI>Coello</HI> was no le&s;s in favour with Pope Gre|gory the XIIIth and Sixtus Quin|tus, with the Dukes of Florence and Savoy, Cardinal Farne&s;e and many other illu&s;trious characters of that time.

<P>If <HI>Coello</HI> cannot properly be con&s;idered as a native of Spain, he mu&s;t be acknowledged to rank high among&s;t the chief arti&s;ts, who have flouri&s;hed in that king|dom: His paintings in the E&s;co|rial, which are chiefly of Saints af|fixed

to the re&s;pective altars, do great honour to his memory; the portrait, that he made of the great patriarch San Ignacio, drawn from an impre&s;&s;ion of his face, taken in wax after his death, is much ce|lebrated; and his original figures of Si&s;iphus and Titius, as well as his copies from <HI>Titiano</HI> of Tanta|lus and Ixion, now in the palace of Madrid, are noble &s;pecimens. His portraits of many royal and noble per&s;ons, which are &s;poken of as excellent, peri&s;hed with many other of his capital works in the unfortunate fire of the Par|do; of all which &s;urvive, the prin|cipal in point of compo&s;ition is pre&s;erved in the church of San Geronimo in Madrid, repre&s;ent|ing

the King encouraged conver&s;a|tion, <HI>Coello</HI> knew every body and every thing, and out of tho&s;e could chu&s;e his topics &s;uitably and treat them agreeably; if the King was di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ilence during his vi&s;it, as was frequently the ca&s;e, <HI>Coello</HI> pur&s;ued his work with fixt atten|tion, he pre&s;&s;ed his canva&s;s into life with all the energy and &s;pirit of his genius: The king &s;ate by, contemplating the new creation, which the hand of art was forming in his &s;ight, and for a while per|haps forgot the breaches he had cau&s;ed in that of nature's produ|cing: By the ea&s;el of <HI>Coello,</HI> if he was not defended from the cares, he was at lea&s;t &s;ecure from the in|tru&s;ions of Royalty. Whoever has

been accu&s;tomed to look on du|ring the operations of indu&s;try or art, mu&s;t have experienced a re|po&s;e of thought, an interval from worldly inquietude, that &s;teals in|&s;en&s;ibly and gradually upon the mind, as &s;leep does on the body: If &s;uch are our &s;en&s;ations, whil&s;t contemplating the labourer at his ta&s;k, or the mechanic at his trade, how much do we improve the avo|cation, when the eye is called off from every other object and fixed upon one of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing and &s;urprizing in the whole circle of human arts and inventions! We may naturally believe that Philip felt the benefits of this re&s;ource: In his council-chamber the defec|tion of provinces galled his pride,

and the di&s;per&s;ion of armadas thwarted his ambition: In his clo&s;et the injured Perez &s;tung his con&s;cience and the unhappy Don Carlos haunted his imagination; but in the academy of <HI>Coello</HI> he &s;aw him&s;elf in his mo&s;t favourable light, and perhaps the only one, which can reflect a lu&s;tre on his memory.</P>
<P>The great works, which Philip was carrying on at the E&s;corial, and the magnificent collection of paintings he was there ama&s;&s;ing, at|tracted the attention of all the ar|ti&s;ts in Europe, whil&s;t the wealth and munificence of the King held out ample encouragement to ad|venturers of merit.

<P><HI>Federico Zucaro</HI> is well known to all, who are conver&s;ant in the hi&s;tories of the Italian ma&s;ters; the di&s;&s;atisfaction that his perform|ances in Spain gave to Philip is no le&s;s notorious; in&s;omuch that his works were removed out of the E&s;corial by order of that King, and his fre&s;co paintings in the cloy&s;ter replaced by others of <HI>Pe|regrino Tibaldi.</HI> Whether Philip's expectations were rai&s;ed too high by the report his emi&s;&s;aries in Italy had made of <HI>Zucaro</HI>'s ta|lents, or whether the vanity of the man di&s;gu&s;ted him, which might

well be the ca&s;e, &s;o it was, that of all the arti&s;ts employed at the E&s;|corial, he alone fell &s;hort in exe|cution and failed of &s;ucce&s;s. At the &s;ame time, that Philip di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed him from his &s;ervice, he compen&s;ated him in &s;o princely a manner for his undertaking, that I am inclined to think upon the evi|dence of &s;ome letters, which pa&s;&s;|ed between the King and his am|ba&s;&s;ador at Rome <HI>Don Juan de Zuniga</HI> and the <HI>Conde de Olivares,</HI> that the payments made to <HI>Zucaro</HI> were larger, than to any other painter, which came into Spain; but however he might profit in re&s;pect of intere&s;t, he certainly was a con&s;iderable lo&s;er in point of re|putation by his adventure: <HI>Sen~or,</HI>
<PB N="112" REF="116">
&s;ays <HI>Zucaro,</HI> as he was di&s;playing a painting of the Nativity for the great altar at the E&s;corial, <HI>you now behold all that art can execute; be|yond this, which I have done, the powers of painting cannot go:</HI> The King was &s;ilent for a time, and &s;o unmoved, that neither approba|tion nor contempt could be deter|mined from the expre&s;&s;ion of his countenance; at la&s;t, pre&s;erving &s;till the &s;ame indifference, he a&s;k|ed if tho&s;e were eggs, which one of the &s;hepherds, in the act of running, carried in his ba&s;ket; the painter an&s;wered him they were: <HI>'Tis well he did not break them,</HI> &s;aid the King, and turned away; the picture was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. Upon another occa&s;ion, when Philip ex|pre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="113" REF="117">
his di&s;&s;atisfaction with a compo&s;ition <HI>Zucaro</HI> had made up|on the &s;ubject of the Vi&s;itation, he excu&s;ed him&s;elf by &s;aying it was painted by his &s;cholars; Philip de&s;ired him to paint the &s;ame &s;ub|ject with his own hand; he did &s;o, and the &s;econd work fell &s;hort of the fir&s;t, and Philip remained &s;till more di&s;&s;atisfied than before.

<PB N="115" REF="119">
treated the &s;ubjects of the Purifi|cation, the Flight into Egypt, the Slaughter of the Innocents, Chri&s;t in the Temple, the Temptations in the Wilderne&s;s, the Election of the Apo&s;tles, the Re&s;urrection of La|zarus, the Expul&s;ion of the Mo|ney-changers out of the Temple and the various pa&s;&s;ages of the Pa&s;&s;ion and Re&s;urrection of the Saviour, with other &s;ubjects of &s;a|cred hi&s;tory. The cloy&s;ter is of the conventual &s;ort, &s;ad and gloomy, and neither very &s;pacious nor lof|ty; it was, when I &s;aw it, very un|cleanly, and I found it in the &s;ame condition upon repeated vi&s;its: The fre&s;cos have received great injury, not only from time and climate, but from actual violence
<PB N="116" REF="120">
and notorious want of care; their effect in my opinion is by no means plea&s;ing, whether owing to the cau&s;e above-mentioned, or the dry har&s;h uniformity of the co|louring, of a red and bricky hue, unrelieved by any accompaniment, or compartment, and the &s;izes di&s;|proportionate to the cloy&s;ter, which as I before ob&s;erved is neither lofty nor wide: I have no doubt they would make a con&s;picuous fi|gure as engravings, and the date of their exi&s;tence might be there|by prolonged; but that I conceive will reach its final period without reprieve of this, or any other &s;ort. Several paintings of <HI>Peregrino</HI> are to be &s;een in the great church, particularly a St. Michael with the
<PB N="117" REF="121">
Fall of the Angels, a Martyrdom of San Lorenzo and two very grand compo&s;itions of the Nati|vity and Adoration, which he exe|cuted to replace tho&s;e of <HI>Zucaro</HI> on the &s;ame &s;ubjects, which Philip had rejected: The paintings in the Sagrario are by <HI>Peregrino</HI> on the &s;ubject of Abraham and Mel|chi&s;edech; but what above all things el&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hes his reputa|tion in Spain is the cieling of the Library: In this compo&s;ition the painter has per&s;onified the Arts and Sciences in different compart|ments; the four Doctors of the church, with &s;everal eminent an|tient philo&s;ophers, Socrates, Plato, Ari&s;totle and Seneca, accompanied with all their proper attributes and

in&s;ignia, inter&s;per&s;ed with many beautiful groupes of children and figures in the nude, &s;upporting the cornice and fe&s;toons, in various po&s;tures and fore&s;hortenings of grand force and expre&s;&s;ion in the &s;tile of <HI>Michael Angelo,</HI> in perfect drawing and admirable per&s;pective. <HI>Peregrino</HI> was liberally rewarded by Philip and returning to Italy died at Milan in 1600, aged 73 years.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame year died <HI>Romuh Cincinnato</HI> the Florentine; he al&s;o was one of Philip's painters, and contributed to illuminate this aera of arts and &s;ciences by a re&s;idence of many years in Spain, during which he made many excellent paintings, particularly in fre&s;co, not only in the E&s;corial, but al&s;o

<PB N="120" REF="124">
is repre&s;ented with his back turn|ed to the &s;pectator; of this he was &s;o con&s;cious, that he is reported to have declared that he prized one limb of this figure above all his paintings in the E&s;corial. He died in the year 1600 in an ad|vanced age univer&s;ally e&s;teemed and lamented.</P>
<P>In this year <HI>Cae&s;ar Arba&s;ia</HI> came into Spain upon the invitation of <HI>Pablo de Ce&s;pedes</HI> canon of Cordo|va, with whom he had formed an intimacy at Rome: He re|mained in Cordova long enough to paint the cieling of the cathe|dral and returned into Italy.</P>
<P><HI>Bartolome de Carducho</HI> accompa|nied his ma&s;ter <HI>Zucaro</HI> into Spain and was employed in the E&s;cori|al:
<PB N="121" REF="125">
He was a native of Florence and of great eminence in his art; he was concerned with <HI>Peregrin de Bolonia</HI> in painting the famous cieling of the library; the figures of Ari&s;totle, Euclid, Archimedes and Cicero are his, and do him high honour both for their execu|tion and de&s;ign: Part of the fre&s;co in the cloy&s;ters is of his painting, and gave entire &s;atisfaction to Phi|lip, who rewarded him with two hundred ducats over and above his &s;alary, and when <HI>Carducho</HI> was in|vited into France by order of his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, Philip ex|pre&s;t &s;uch regret at the propo&s;al of his departure, that he excu&s;ed him&s;elf to the French Amba&s;&s;ador <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">n the hand&s;ome&s;t manner he could,

There is no doubt but <HI>Carducho</HI> pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time at Valladolid, where &s;everal of his pictures are remaining; he painted al&s;o &s;ome pictures for the palace of Madrid, particularly one of the La&s;t Supper, and another on the &s;ubject of the Circumci&s;ion, which is an excellent performance; but the picture, which of all others e&s;tabli&s;hes his reputation in Spain, is a De&s;cent from the Cro&s;s, which now hangs in a &s;mall chapel near the &s;ide door of the church of San Phelipe el Real in Madrid; a piece of &s;uch &s;uperior execution, that it may well be taken for one of <HI>Ra|phael</HI>'s. In the church of San Ge|ronimo in the &s;econd chapel on the right hand there is an excellent

Carducho</HI> continued in Spain &s;eve|ral years after the death of Philip the &s;econd, and was appointed by the &s;ucceeding King Philip the third to paint a gallery in the pa|lace of the Pardo; the &s;ubject was to be taken from the life and ac|tions of the Emperor Charles: <HI>Car|ducho</HI> begun the work, but died at the Pardo, aged 50 years, before

without an in&s;tance to the contrary, from the mo&s;t &s;acred pa&s;&s;ages of revelation; but his life, unlike that of <HI>Morales,</HI> was in uni&s;on with the purity and au&s;terity of his ta&s;te; prepared by confe&s;&s;ion and fa&s;ting, he fir&s;t approached the al|tar before he vi&s;ited the ea&s;el; painting with him was an act of piety and devotion: The charac|ters, which filled his canva&s;s, were of the holie&s;t &s;ort, and, as he gave them life, he gave them adoration: As the exerci&s;e of his art was in him an office of devotion, &s;o his moderation kept him from en|gaging in any private commi&s;&s;ions with a view to gain; and I am inclined to doubt if any picture of <HI>Juanes</HI> is at this hour in lay po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion:

nothing is neglected or left, every figure is laboured into life, and the labour is the labour of love, not the ta&s;k of the hireling: It is greatly to be lamented, that the&s;e precious remains are &s;hut in the convents of Valencia, without any hope of delivery and that free di&s;|play, of which the mortmain of &s;uper&s;tition &s;eems for ever to de|prive them.

for which he is chiefly celebrated, is his compo&s;ition on the &s;ubject of the Immaculate Conception in the late college of the Je&s;uits in that city; this picture is the ob|ject of general veneration, and by the devout and credulous con&s;i|dered as an actual original, or very little removed from an ori|ginal; for the tradition runs, that it was painted by the order of Father <HI>Martin Alberto,</HI> to whom the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin conde&s;cended to appear on the eve of the A&s;&s;ump|tion, and required the holy Father to cau&s;e her portrait to be taken in the dre&s;s &s;he then wore, which was a white frock, or tunic, with a blue cloak, together with the fol|lowing accompaniments, viz. at

eminent men: The genius; which this encouragement called up, ap|pears to have lo&s;t none of its force during the reign of his &s;on and &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or Philip the IIId.

<PB N="156" REF="160">
efforts at originality he has expo&s;ed him&s;elf to the ridicule of all good judges: When he departs from <HI>Titiano,</HI> he departs from nature and &s;ub&s;titutes in her &s;tead an ex|travagance of de&s;ign, with &s;o faulty a mode both of colouring and drawing, that he is no longer the &s;ame ma&s;ter: Of this &s;ort are his paintings in the convent of Donna Maria de Aragon at Madrid, and the picture which he drew for the E&s;corial by order of Philip the IId. on the &s;ubject of the martyrdom of San Mauricio and his compa|nions: Philip was too good a judge not to &s;ee the extravagance of his compo&s;ition, and refu&s;ed it a place in his collection; <HI>Dominico Greco</HI> made humble &s;uit to &s;ave the credit
<PB N="157" REF="161">
of his work, and it is likely was convinced of the errors, into which he had been led by an affectation of &s;ingularity, for he made &s;ome corrections; after which his pic|ture was, with &s;ome degree of dif|ficulty, admitted to a place, though not very con&s;picuous in the Sala de Capitulo; whil&s;t <HI>Romulo Cin|cinnato</HI> was deputed in his &s;tead to the more honourable ta&s;k of paint|ing an altar-piece for the chapel of the Saint above mentioned. In the cathedral of Toledo there are &s;ome pictures by <HI>Dominico</HI> in his be&s;t manner, which are admirable performances; particularly a grand compo&s;ition on the parting of the raiment of our Saviour before his crucifixion, which hangs in the &s;a|cri&s;ty,
<PB N="158" REF="162">
and is &s;o entirely in the &s;tile and manner of <HI>Titiano,</HI> that his re|putation could have &s;uffered no in|jury by its adoption. In the &s;ame place are the twelve Apo&s;tles by the &s;ame ma&s;ter, but in an inferior &s;tile. In the pari&s;h church of Santo Tom&eacute; is a very capital picture of <HI>Dominico</HI>'s on the interment of <HI>Don-Gonzalo Ruiz</HI> of Toledo; this illu&s;trious per&s;on, who was <HI>Conde de Orgaz,</HI> founded an Augu&s;tine convent un|der the title of San E&s;tevan in the city of Toledo, in commemoration of which pious act <HI>Dominico</HI> has re|pre&s;ented San Augu&s;tin and San E&s;tevan in the act of placing his body in the tomb: This picture co&s;t the Cardinal Archbi&s;hop of Toledo, <HI>Don Ga&s;par de Quiroga,</HI> two thou&s;and

<P>The three great kingdoms of Europe (Spain, France and Eng|land) were at this time governed by the mini&s;ters Olivares, Richelieu and Buckingham; it was the reign of favourites: Buckingham, who had more caprice and le&s;s genius than either of his contemporaries,

<PB N="181" REF="185">
had wantonly avowed eternal en|mity to the mini&s;ter of Spain, he now entered upon a corre&s;pondence with <HI>Rubens</HI> on the means of recon|ciling the kingdoms, and this pro|duced the &s;econd vi&s;it, which that arti&s;t paid to Madrid in quality of amba&s;&s;ador extraordinary from the court of Bru&s;&s;els in the year 1628. He &s;taid nine months in Madrid on this negociation, and, being at times confined to his chamber by the gout in his feet, he took the opportunity of working at his ea&s;el; in which time he compleated eight grand pictures for the great &s;aloon of the palace, of which his famous Rape of the Sabines was one, and al&s;o his Battle of the Romans and the Sabines. In this period, &s;uch
<PB N="182" REF="186">
was the rapidity of his pencil, that he took five &s;everal portraits of King Philip, one of which is eque&s;trian and grouped with &s;e|veral other figures; a magnificent performance, and for which he re|ceived a magnificent reward, with the honour of knighthood, of naturalization and the golden key, as gentleman of the chamber. He painted the Infanta a half-length, and the King of the &s;ame &s;ize by commi&s;&s;ion from the Arch-duche&s;s I&s;abella; he made five or &s;ix other portraits of illu&s;trious per&s;ons.</P>
