<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of the Shell of Te&s;taceous Fi&s;hes.</HEAD>
<P>ONE is apt to combine very di&s;&s;imilar objects in the &s;ame
groupe, when hurried into the vortex of method. No two animals are more unlike
each other than the whale and the limpet, the tortoi&s;e and the oy&s;ter. Yet,
as the&s;e animals mu&s;t find &s;ome place in the picture of animated nature,
it is be&s;t to let them re&s;t in the &s;tation where the generality of
mankind have a&s;&s;igned them; and as they have been willing to give them all
from their abode the name of fi&s;hes, it is wi&s;e&s;t in us to conform.</P>
<P>But before I enter into any hi&s;tory of &s;hell-fi&s;h, it may
not be improper to ob&s;erve, that <PB N="2" REF="5"> naturali&s;ts who have
treated on this part of hi|&s;tory, have entirely attended to outward forms;
and, as in many other in&s;tances, for&s;aking the de&s;cription of the animal
it&s;elf, have exhau&s;ted all their indu&s;try in de&s;cribing the habitation.
In con&s;equence of this radical error, we have volumes written upon the
&s;ubject of &s;hells, and very little &s;aid on the hi&s;tory of
&s;hell-fi&s;h. The life of the&s;e indu&s;trious creatures, that for the
mo&s;t part creep along the bottom, or immove|ably wait till driven as the
waves happen to di|rect, is almo&s;t entirely unknown. The wreath|ing of their
&s;hells, or the &s;pots with which they are tinctured, have been de&s;cribed
with a mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting prolixity; but their appetites and their combats,
their e&s;capes and humble arts of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, have been utterly
neglected.</P>
<P>As I have only undertaken to write the hi|&s;tory of animated
nature, the variety of &s;hells, and their peculiar &s;pots or blemi&s;hes, do
not come within my de&s;ign. However, the manner in which &s;hells are formed
is a part of natural hi&s;tory connected with my plan, as it pre-&s;up|po&s;es
vital force or indu&s;try in the animal that forms them.</P>
<P>The &s;hell may be con&s;idered as an habitation &s;upplied by
nature. It is an hard &s;tony &s;ub|&s;tance, made up &s;omewhat in the manner
of a <PB N="3" REF="6"> wall. Part of the &s;tony &s;ub&s;tance the animal
derives from outward objects, and the fluids of the animal it&s;elf furni&s;h
the cement. The&s;e united make that firm covering which &s;hell-fi&s;h
generally re&s;ide in till they die.</P>
<P>But, in order to give a more exact idea of the manner in which
&s;ea-&s;hells are formed, we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to an animal that lives
upon land, with the formation of who&s;e &s;hell we are be&s;t acquainted. This
is the garden-&s;nail, that carries its box upon its back, who&s;e hi&s;tory
Swammerdam has taken &s;uch endle&s;s pains to de&s;cribe. As the manner of the
formation of this animal's &s;hell extends to that of all others that have
&s;hells, whether they live upon land or in the water, it will be proper to
give it a place before we enter upon the hi&s;tory of te&s;taceous
fi&s;hes.</P>
<P>To begin with the animal in its earlie&s;t &s;tate, and trace
the progre&s;s of its &s;hell from the time it fir&s;t appears&mdash;The
in&s;tant the young &s;nail leaves the egg, it carries its &s;hell or its box
no its back. It does not leave the egg till it is arrived at a certain growth,
when its little ha|bitation is &s;ufficiently hardened. This beginning of the
&s;hell is not much bigger than a pin's head, but grows in a very rapid manner,
having at <PB N="4" REF="7"> fir&s;t but two circumvolutions, for the re&s;t
are added as the &s;nail grows larger. In proportion as the animal encrea&s;es
in &s;ize, the circumvolu|tions of the &s;hell encrea&s;e al&s;o, until the
number of tho&s;e volutes come to be five, which is never exceeded.</P>
<P>The part where the animal enlarges its &s;hell is at the mouth,
to which it adds in proportion as it finds it&s;elf &s;tinted in its habitation
below. Being about to enlarge its &s;hell, it is &s;een with its little teeth
biting and clearing away the &s;caly &s;kin that grows at the edges. It is
&s;ome|times &s;een to eat tho&s;e bits it thus takes off; at other times it
only cleans away the margin when covered with films, and then adds another rim
to its &s;hell.</P>
<P>For the purpo&s;es of making the &s;hell, which is natural to
the animal, and without which it could not live three days, its whole body is
furni&s;hed with glands, from the orifices of which flows out a kind of &s;limy
fluid, like &s;mall &s;piders threads, which join together in one common
cru&s;t or &s;urface, and in time con|den&s;e and acquire a &s;tony hardne&s;s.
It is this &s;limy humour that grows into a mem|brane and afterwards a &s;tony
&s;kin; nor can it have e&s;caped any who have ob&s;erved the track of a
&s;nail; that gli&s;tening &s;ub&s;tance <PB N="5" REF="8"> which it leaves on
the floor or the wall is no other than the materials with which the animal adds
to its &s;hell, or repairs it when broken.</P>
<P>Now to exhibit in a more &s;atisfactory manner the method in
which the &s;hell is formed,&mdash;The &s;nail bur&s;ts from its egg with its
&s;hell upon its back; this &s;hell, though very &s;imple, is the center round
which every &s;ucceeding convolu|tion of the &s;hell is formed, by new circles
added to the fir&s;t. As the body of the &s;nail can be ex|tended no where but
to the aperture, the mouth of the &s;hell only can of con&s;equence receive
augmentation. The &s;ub&s;tance of which the &s;hell is compo&s;ed is chiefly
&s;upplied by the animal it&s;elf, and is no more than a &s;limy fluid which
hardens into bone. This fluid pa&s;&s;es through an infinite number of little
glands till it arrives at the pores of the &s;kin; but there it is &s;topped by
the &s;hell that covers the part below; and therefore is &s;ent to the mouth of
the &s;hell, where it is wanted for its enlargement. There the fir&s;t layer of
&s;lime &s;oon hardens; and then ano|ther is added, which hardens al&s;o, till
in time the &s;hell becomes as thick as is requi&s;ite for the animal's
pre&s;ervation. Thus every &s;hell may be con&s;idered as compo&s;ed of a
number of layers of &s;lime, which have entirely proceeded from the animal's
own body.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="9">But though this be the general opinion with
regard to the formation of &s;hells, I cannot avoid thinking there are &s;till
other &s;ub&s;tances be&s;ide the animal's own &s;lime which go to the
compo&s;ition of its &s;hell, or at lea&s;t to its external coat, which is ever
different from the internal. The &s;ub&s;tances I mean are the accidental
con|cretions of earthy or &s;aline parts, which adhere to the &s;limy matter
upon its fir&s;t emi&s;&s;ion. By adopting this theory, we can more
&s;atisfactorily account for the various colours of the &s;hell, which cannot
be &s;uppo&s;ed to take its tincture from the animal's body, as is the u&s;ual
opinion; for all the internal parts of the &s;hell are but of one white colour;
it is only the outermo&s;t layer of the &s;hell that is &s;o beautifully
varied, &s;o richly tinctured with that variety of colours we behold in the
cabinets of the curious. If the external coat be &s;caled off, as Mr.
Argenville a&s;&s;erts, all the inner &s;ub&s;tance will be found but of one
&s;imple colouring; and con&s;equently the animal's own juices can give only
one colour; whereas we &s;ee &s;ome &s;hells &s;tained with an hundred.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual way of accounting for the different colouring of
&s;hells, which &s;eems to me erroneous, is this. In the body of every one of
the&s;e ani|mals, &s;everal &s;treaks are di&s;cerned of a different 
<PB N="7" REF="10"> colour from the re&s;t. This variety, &s;ay they, is an
inconte&s;tible proof that the juices flowing from tho&s;e parts will be al&s;o
of a different hue; and will con&s;equently tinge that part of the &s;hell
which their &s;lime compo&s;es of a different colour. But this &s;y&s;tem, as
was ob&s;erved before, is overthrown by the fact, which di&s;covers that only
the outer &s;urface of the &s;hell is tinged; whereas, by this, it would have
been coloured throughout: nay, by this &s;y&s;tem, the internal parts of the
&s;hell would be &s;tained with the mo&s;t vivid colouring, as being lea&s;t
expo&s;ed to the external injuries of the element where it is placed. But the
truth is, the animal re&s;iding in the &s;hell has none of the&s;e various
colours thus talked of: its &s;lime is a &s;imple pellucid &s;ub&s;tance; and
the only marblings which ap|pear in its body, are the colour of the food, which
is &s;een through its tran&s;parent inte&s;tines. We mu&s;t, therefore, account
for the various colouring of its &s;hell upon a different principle.</P>
<P>If, as I &s;aid, we examine the cabinets of the curious, we
&s;hall find &s;hells with various and beautiful colouring; we &s;hall find
them gene|rally furni&s;hed with a white ground, tinctured with red, yellow,
brown, green, and &s;everal other &s;hades and lovely mixtures, but never blue.
Shells are of almo&s;t all colours but blue. <PB N="8" REF="11"> The rea&s;on
&s;eems to be obvious; for blue is the colour which &s;ea-water changes. A
piece of &s;ilk, or a feather, of this colour, put into an in|fu&s;ion of
&s;alt, urine, or nitre, lo&s;e their tint entirely. Now may not this give us a
hint with re&s;pect to the operation of Nature in co|louring her &s;hells? May
we not from hence conclude, that &s;ea-water is efficacious in giving colour or
taking it away? That, to produce colour, the animal not only furni&s;hes its
juices, but the &s;ea or the earth that mixture of &s;ub&s;tance which is to
unite with them. Neither the ani|mal &s;lime alone, nor the external earthy or
&s;a|line &s;ub&s;tances alone, could produce colours; but both united, produce
an effect which nei|ther &s;eparately was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. Thus &s;hells
a&s;&s;ume every colour but blue; and that &s;ea-water, in&s;tead of producing,
would be apt to de&s;troy.</P>
<P>From hence, therefore, it appears, that the animal does not
alone tincture its own &s;hell; but that external cau&s;es co-operate in
contributing to its beauty. It is probable that, from the nature of its food,
or from other circum&s;tances unknown to us, the external layers of its &s;lime
may be of different con&s;i&s;tencies; &s;o as, when joined with the particles
of earth or &s;alt that are accidentally united with them from without, 
<PB N="9" REF="12"> they a&s;&s;ume various and beautiful hues. But the
internal layers, which receive no foreign ad|mixture, &s;till pre&s;erve the
natural colour of the animal, and continue white without any vari|ation.</P>
<P>Thus far we &s;ee that the animal is not wholly the agent in
giving beauty and colouring to its &s;hell: but it &s;eems otherwi&s;e with
re&s;pect to its convolutions, its prominences, and general form. The&s;e
entirely depend upon the art of the animal; or rather upon its in&s;tincts;
which, in the &s;ame kinds, are ever invariable. The &s;hell generally bears
&s;ome rude re&s;emblance to the body upon which it has been moulded. Thus it
is ob&s;ervable in all &s;ea-&s;hells, that if the animal has any tumour or
excre&s;cence on its body, it creates likewi&s;e a &s;welling in that part of
the incru&s;tation to which it corre&s;ponds. When the animal begins to alter
its po&s;ition, and to make new additions to its apartments, the &s;ame
protuberance which had rai&s;ed the &s;hell before in one part, &s;wells it
again at &s;ome little di&s;tance; by which means we &s;ee the &s;ame
in|equality, in a &s;piral line, all round the &s;hell. Sometimes the&s;e
tumours of the animal are &s;o large, or &s;o pointed, that tho&s;e which
ri&s;e over them in the incru&s;tation, appear like horns: after this the
animal di&s;engages it&s;elf from its <PB N="10" REF="13"> fir&s;t cavities,
and then, by fre&s;h evacuations, a&s;&s;umes a new &s;et of horns; and &s;o
encrea&s;es the number in proportion to its growth. If, on the other hand, the
body happens to be cha|nelled, the &s;hell that covers it will be chanelled
likewi&s;e; if there be any protuberances in the body, which wind in a &s;piral
line about it, the &s;hell will likewi&s;e have its tumours and cavities
winding round to the end.</P>
<P>In this manner, as the animals are of various forms, the
&s;hells exhibit an equal variety. In|deed, the diver&s;ity is &s;o great, and
the figures and colours &s;o very &s;triking, that &s;everal per|&s;ons, with a
kind of harmle&s;s indolence, have made the arrangement of them the &s;tudy and
the bu&s;ine&s;s of their lives. Tho&s;e who con&s;ult their beauty alone, take
care to have them poli&s;hed, and to have an external cru&s;t, or perio&s;teum,
as Swammerdam calls it, &s;coured off from their, &s;urfaces by &s;pirit of
&s;alt. But there are others that, with more learned affectation, keep them
exactly in the &s;tate in which they have been found, with their precious
cru&s;t &s;till round them. The expence men have &s;ometimes been at in making
&s;uch collections, is amazing; and &s;ome &s;hells, &s;uch as the Stairs
&s;hell or the Admiral &s;hell, are not more pre|cious for their
&s;carcene&s;s, than pearls are for <PB N="11" REF="14"> their beauty. Indeed,
it is the &s;carcity, and not the beauty, of the object that determines the
value of all natural curio&s;ities. Tho&s;e &s;hells that offer but little
beautiful to the ignorant are often the mo&s;t precious; and tho&s;e &s;hells
which an unlearned &s;pectator would &s;top to ob|&s;erve with admiration, one
accu&s;tomed to the vi|&s;itation of cabinets, would pa&s;s over with
di&s;dain. The&s;e collections, however, have their u&s;e; not only by
exhibiting the va&s;t variety of Nature's operations, but al&s;o by exciting
our curio&s;ity to the con&s;ideration of the animals that form them. A mind
that can find innocent entertainment in the&s;e humble contemplations is well
employed; and, as we &s;ay of children, is kept from doing mi&s;chief. Although
there may be nobler occu|pations than that con&s;idering the convolutions of a
&s;hell, yet there may be &s;ome who want the ambition to a&s;pire after &s;uch
arduous pur&s;uits; there may be &s;ome unfit for them; there may be &s;ome who
find their ambition fully gratified by the prai&s;e which the collectors of
&s;hells be&s;tow upon each other. Indeed, for a day or two, there is no mind
that a cabinet of &s;hells cannot furni&s;h with plea&s;ing employment. What
can be more gratifying, as Pliny &s;ays<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Plin. IX.
33.</BIBL></NOTE>, than to view Nature in all her irregularities, 
<PB N="12" REF="15"> and &s;porting in her variety of &s;hells! Such a
dif|ference of colour do they exhibit; &s;uch a dif|ference of figure; flat,
concave, long, lunated, drawn round in a circle, the orbit cut in two; &s;ome
are &s;een with a ri&s;ing on the back, &s;ome &s;mooth, &s;ome wrinkled,
toothed, &s;treaked, the point variou&s;ly intorted, the mouth pointing like a
dagger, folded back, bent inwards: all the&s;e variations, and many more,
furni&s;h at once novelty, elegance, and &s;peculation.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the figure of &s;hells, Ari&s;totle has
divided them into three kinds; and his method is, of all others, the mo&s;t
conformable to nature. The&s;e are, fir&s;t, the Univalve, or Turbinated, which
con&s;i&s;t of one piece, like the box of a &s;nail; &s;econdly, the Bivalve,
con&s;i&s;ting of two pieces, united by a hinge, like an oy&s;ter; and thirdly,
the Multivalve, con&s;i&s;ting of more than two pieces, as the acorn-&s;hell,
which has not le&s;s than twelve pieces that go to its compo&s;ition. All
the&s;e kinds are found in the &s;ea at different depths; and are valuable in
proportion to their &s;carcene&s;s or beauty.</P>
<P>From the variety of the colours and figure of &s;hells, we may
pa&s;s to that of their place and &s;ituation. Some are found in the &s;ea;
&s;ome in fre&s;h-water rivers; &s;ome alive upon land; and a &s;till greater
quantity dead in the bowels of the <PB N="13" REF="16"> earth; But wherever
&s;hells are found, they are univer&s;ally known to be compo&s;ed of one and
the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance. They are formed of an ani|mal or calcarious earth,
that ferments with vi|negar and other acids, and that burns into lime, and will
not ea&s;ily melt into gla&s;s. Such is the &s;ub&s;tance of which they are
compo&s;ed; and of their &s;poils, many philo&s;ophers think that a great part
of the &s;urface of the earth is compo&s;ed at pre&s;ent. It is &s;uppo&s;ed by
them, that chalks, marles, and all &s;uch earths as fer|ment with vinegar, are
nothing more than a compo&s;ition of &s;hells, decayed, and crumbled down to
one uniform ma&s;s.</P>
<P>Sea-&s;hells are either found in the depths of the ocean, or
they are ca&s;t empty and for&s;aken of their animals upon &s;hore. Tho&s;e
which are fi&s;hed up from the deep, are called by the Latin name Pelagii;
tho&s;e that are ca&s;t upon &s;hore, are called Littorales. Many of the
pelagii are never &s;een upon &s;hore; they continue in the depths where they
are bred; and we owe their capture only to accident. The&s;e, there|fore, are
the mo&s;t &s;carce &s;hells; and con&s;e|quently, the mo&s;t valuable. The
littorales are more frequent; and &s;uch as are of the &s;ame kind with the
pelagii are not &s;o beautiful. As they are often empty and for&s;aken, and as 
<PB N="14" REF="17"> their animal is dead and perhaps putrid in the bottom of
the &s;hell, they by this means lo&s;e the whitene&s;s and the brilliancy of
their colouring. They are not unfrequently al&s;o found eaten through, either
by worms, or by each other; and they are thus rendered le&s;s valuable: but
what decrea&s;es their price &s;till more is, when they are &s;caled and worn
by lying too long empty at the bottom, or expo&s;ed upon the &s;hore. Upon the
whole, however, &s;ea-&s;hells exceed either land or fo&s;&s;il &s;hells in
beauty; they receive the highe&s;t poli&s;h, and exhibit the mo&s;t brilliant
and various colouring.</P>
<P>Fre&s;h-water &s;hells are neither &s;o numerous, &s;o various,
or &s;o beautiful as tho&s;e belonging to the &s;ea. They want that &s;olidity
which the others have: their clavicle, as it is called, is neither &s;o
prominent nor &s;o &s;trong; and not having a &s;aline &s;ub&s;tance to tinge
the &s;urface of the &s;hell, the colours are ob&s;cure. In fre&s;h-water there
are but two kinds of &s;hells; namely, the bivalved and the turbinated.</P>
<P>Living land &s;hells are more beautiful, though not &s;o various
as tho&s;e of fre&s;h-water; and &s;ome not inferior to &s;ea &s;hells in
beauty. They are indeed but of one kind, namely, the turbinated; but in that
there are found four or five very beautiful varieties.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="18">Of fo&s;&s;il, or, as they are called,
<HI>extraneous</HI> &s;hells, found in the bowels of the earth, there are great
numbers, and as great a variety. In this cla&s;s there are as many kinds as in
the &s;ea it&s;elf. There are found the turbinated, the bi|valve, and the
multivalve kinds; and of all the&s;e, many at pre&s;ent not to be found even in
the ocean. Indeed, the number is &s;o great, and the varieties &s;o many, that
it was long the opinion of naturali&s;ts, that they were merely the capricious
productions of Nature, and had never given retreat to animals who&s;e
habitations they re&s;embled. They were found, not only of various kinds, but
in different &s;tates of pre|&s;ervation: &s;ome had the &s;hell entire,
compo&s;ed, as in its primitive &s;tate, of a white calcarious earth, and
filled with earth, or even empty; others were found with the &s;hell entire,
but filled with a &s;ub&s;tance which was petrified by time; others, and
the&s;e in great numbers, were found with the &s;hell entirely mouldered away,
but the petrified &s;ub&s;tance that filled it &s;till exhibiting the figure of
the &s;hell; others &s;till, that had been lodged near earth or &s;tone,
impre&s;&s;ed their print upon the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances, and left the
impre&s;&s;ion, though they them&s;elves were de|cayed: la&s;tly, &s;ome
&s;hells were found half moul|dered away, their parts &s;caling off from each 
<PB N="16" REF="19"> other in the &s;ame order in which they were ori|ginally
formed. However, the&s;e different &s;tages of the &s;hell, and even their
fermenting with acids, were at fir&s;t in&s;ufficient to convince tho&s;e who
had before a&s;&s;igned them a different origin. They were &s;till con&s;idered
as accidentally and &s;portively formed, and depo&s;ited in the various
repo&s;itories where they were found, but no way appertaining to any part of
animated nature. This put &s;ucceeding enquirers upon more minute re&s;earches;
and they &s;oon began to find, that often where they dug up petrified &s;hells
or teeth, they could di&s;cover the petrified remains of &s;ome other bony
parts of the body. They found that the &s;hells which were taken from the
earth, exhibited, the u&s;ual defects and mi&s;|chances, which the &s;ame kind
are known to receive at &s;ea. They &s;hewed them not only tinctured with a
&s;alt water cru&s;t, but pierced in a peculiar manner by the &s;ea worms, that
make the &s;hells of fi&s;hes their favourite food. The&s;e demon&s;trations
were &s;ufficient at la&s;t to convince all but a few philo&s;ophers who died
away, and who&s;e erroneous &s;y&s;tems died with them.</P>
<P>Every &s;hell, therefore, wherever it is found, is now
con&s;idered as the &s;poil of &s;ome animal, that once found &s;helter
therein. It matters not by what unaccountable means they may 
<PB N="17" REF="20"> have wandered from the &s;ea; but they ex|hibit all, and
the mo&s;t certain marks of their origin. From their numbers and &s;ituation,
we are led to conjecture, that the &s;ea reached the places where they are
found; and from their varieties we learn how little we know of all the &s;ea
contains at pre&s;ent; as the earth furni&s;hes many kinds which our mo&s;t
exact and indu&s;trious &s;hell-collectors have not been able to fi&s;h up from
the deep. It is mo&s;t probable, that thou&s;ands o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> different forms &s;till remain at the
bottom un|known; &s;o that we may ju&s;tly &s;ay with the phi|lo&s;opher: 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Ea quae &s;cimus &s;unt pars minima eorum
quae ignoramus.</HI></Q></P>
<P>It is well, however, for mankind, that the defect of our
knowledge on this &s;ubject is, of all parts of learning, that which may be
mo&s;t ea&s;ily di&s;pen&s;ed with. An encrea&s;e in the number of &s;hells,
would throw but very few lights upon the hi&s;tory of the animals that inhabit
them. For &s;uch information we are obliged to tho&s;e men who contemplated
&s;omething more than the out&s;ide of the objects before them. To Reaumur we
are obliged for examining the manners of &s;ome with accuracy; but to
Swam|merdam for more. In fact, this Dutchman has lent an attention to tho&s;e
animals, that almo&s;t exceeds credibility: he has excelled even the 
<PB N="18" REF="21"> in&s;ects he di&s;&s;ected, in patience, indu&s;try, and
per&s;everance. It was in vain that this poor man's father di&s;&s;uaded him
from what the world con&s;idered as a barren pur&s;uit; it was in vain that an
habitual di&s;order, brought on by his application, interrupted his efforts; it
was in vain that mankind treated him with ridicule while living, as they
&s;uffered his works to remain long unprinted and neglected when dead: &s;till
the Dutch philo&s;opher went on, peeping into unwhol&s;ome ditches, wading
through fens, di&s;&s;ecting &s;piders, and enume|rating the blood-ve&s;&s;els
of a &s;nail: like the bee, who&s;e heart he could not only di&s;tingui&s;h,
but di&s;&s;ect, he &s;eemed in&s;tinctively impelled by his ruling
pa&s;&s;ion, although he found nothing but ingratitude from man, and though his
in|du&s;try was apparently becoming fatal to him|&s;elf. From him I will take
&s;ome of the leading features in the hi&s;tory of tho&s;e animals which breed
in &s;hells; previou&s;ly taking my divi&s;ion from Ari&s;totle, who, as was
&s;aid above, divides them into three cla&s;&s;es: the Turbinated, or tho&s;e
of the Snail Kind; the Bivalved, or tho&s;e of the Oy&s;ter Kind; and the
Multivalved, or tho&s;e of the A corn-&s;hell Kind. Of each I will treat in
di&s;tinct chapters.</P>

<P><PB N="19" REF="23"> TO conceive the manner in which tho&s;e
ani|mals &s;ub&s;i&s;t that are hid from us at the bottom of the deep, we
mu&s;t again have recour&s;e to one of a &s;imilar nature and formation, that
we know. The hi&s;tory of the garden-&s;nail has been more copiou&s;ly
con&s;idered than that of the ele|phant; and its anatomy is as well, if not
better known: however, not to give any one object more room in the general
picture of Nature than it is entitled to, it will be &s;ufficient to
ob|&s;erve, that the &s;nail is &s;urprizingly fitted for the life it is formed
to lead. It is furni&s;hed with the organs of life in a manner almo&s;t as
com|plete as the large&s;t animal; with a tongue, brain, &s;alival ducts,
glands, nerves, &s;tomach and in|te&s;tines; liver, heart and
blood-ve&s;&s;els: be&s;ides this, it has a purple bag that furni&s;hes a red
matter to different parts of the body, together with &s;trong mu&s;cles that
hold it to the &s;hell, and which are hardened, like tendons, at their
in&s;ertion.</P>
<P>But the&s;e it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in common with other animals.
We mu&s;t now &s;ee what it has peculiar <PB N="20" REF="24"> to it&s;elf. The
fir&s;t &s;triking peculiarity is, that the animal has got its eyes on the
points of its large&s;t horns. When the &s;nail is in motion, four horns are
di&s;tinctly &s;een; but the two up|permo&s;t and longe&s;t de&s;erve peculiar
con&s;i|deration, both on account of the various mo|tions with which they are
endued, as well as their having their eyes fixed at the extreme ends of them.
The&s;e appear like two blacki&s;h points at their ends. When con&s;idered as
taken out of the body, they are of a bulbous or tur|nip-like figure; they have
but one coat; and the three humours which are common in the eyes of other
animals, namely, the vitreous, the aqueous and the chry&s;talline, are in
the&s;e very indi&s;tinctly &s;een. The eyes the animal can direct to different
objects at plea&s;ure, by a regular motion out of the body; and &s;ome|times it
hides them, by a very &s;wift con|traction into the belly. Under the &s;mall
horns is the animal's mouth; and though it may ap|pear too &s;oft a
&s;ub&s;tance to be furni&s;hed with teeth, yet it has not le&s;s than eight of
them, with which it devours leaves, and other &s;ub|&s;tances, &s;eemingly
harder than it&s;elf; and with which it &s;ometimes bites off pieces of its own
&s;hell.</P>
<P>But what is mo&s;t &s;urprizing in the formation of this animal,
are the parts that &s;erve for ge|neration. <PB N="21" REF="25"> Every &s;nail
is at once male and female; and while it impregnates another, is it&s;elf
impregnated in turn. The ve&s;&s;els &s;up|plying the fluid for this purpo&s;e,
are placed chiefly in the fore part of the neck, and extend them&s;elves over
the body; but the male and female organs of generation, are always found
united, and growing together. There is a large opening on the right &s;ide of
the neck, which &s;erves for very different purpo&s;es. As an anus it gives a
pa&s;&s;age to the excrements; as a mouth it &s;erves for an opening for
re&s;piration; and al&s;o as an organ of generation, it dilates when the
de&s;ire of propagation begins. Within this each animal has tho&s;e parts, or
&s;omething &s;imilar thereto, which continue the kind.</P>
<P>For &s;ome days before coition, the &s;nails gather together,
and lie quiet near each other, eating very little in the mean time; but they
&s;ettle their bodies in &s;uch a po&s;ture, that the neck and head are placed
upright. In the mean time, the apertures on the &s;ide of the neck being
greatly dilated, two organs, re&s;em|bling inte&s;tines, are &s;een i&s;&s;uing
from them, which &s;ome have thought to be the in&s;truments of generation.
Be&s;ide the protru&s;ion of the&s;e, each animal is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
another peculiarity; for, from the &s;ame aperture, they launch forth 
<PB N="22" REF="26"> a kind of dart at each other, which is pretty hard,
barbed, and ending in a very &s;harp point. This is performed when the
apertures approach each other; and then the one is &s;een to &s;hoot its
weapon, which is received by the other, though it &s;ometimes falls to the
ground: &s;ome minutes after, the &s;nail which received the weapon, darts one
of its own at its antagoni&s;t, which is received in like manner. They then
&s;oftly ap|proach &s;till nearer, and apply their bodies one to the other, as
clo&s;ely as the palms and fingers of the hands, when gra&s;ped together. At
that time the horns are &s;een variou&s;ly moving in all directions; and this
&s;ometimes for three days together. The coupling of the&s;e animals is
generally thrice repeated, at intervals of fif|teen days each; and, at every
time, a new dart is mutually emitted.</P>
<P>At the expiration of eighteen days, the &s;nails produce their
eggs, at the opening of the neck, and hide them in the earth with the
greate&s;t &s;olicitude and indu&s;try. The&s;e eggs are in great numbers,
round, white, and covered with a &s;oft &s;hell: they are al&s;o &s;tuck to
each other by an imperceptible &s;lime, like a bunch of grapes, of about the
&s;ize of a &s;mall pea.</P>
<P>When the animal leaves the egg, it is &s;een with a very &s;mall
&s;hell on its back, which has but one convolution; but in proportion as it 
<PB N="23" REF="27"> grows, the &s;hell encrea&s;es in the number of its
circles. The &s;hell always receives its additions at the mouth; the fir&s;t
centre &s;till remaining: the animal &s;ending forth from its body that &s;lime
which hardens into a &s;tony &s;ub&s;tance, and &s;till is fa&s;hioned into
&s;imilar volutions. The garden &s;nail &s;eldom exceeds four rounds and an
half; but &s;ome of the &s;ea &s;nails arrive even at ten.</P>
<P>The &s;nail, thus fitted with its box, which is light and firm,
finds it&s;elf defended in a very ample manner from all external injury.
When|ever it is invaded, it is but retiring into this fortre&s;s, and waiting
patiently till the danger is over. Nor is it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed only of a power
of retreating into its &s;hell; but of mending it when broken. Sometimes
the&s;e animals are cru&s;hed &s;eemingly to pieces; and, to all appearance,
utterly de&s;troyed: yet &s;till they &s;et them&s;elves to work, and, in a few
days, mend all their numerous breaches. The &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance by which the
&s;hell is originally made, goes to the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the ruined
habitation. But all the junctures are very ea&s;ily &s;een, for they have a
fre&s;her colour than the re&s;t, and the whole &s;hell in &s;ome mea&s;ure
re&s;embles an old coat, patched with new pieces. They are &s;ometimes &s;een
with eight or ten of the&s;e patches; &s;o that <PB N="24" REF="28"> the damage
mu&s;t have been apparently irrepa|rable. Still, however, though the animal is
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the power of mending its &s;hell, it cannot, when come to
its full growth, make a new one. Swammerdam tried the experiment: he &s;tripped
a &s;nail of its &s;hell, without hurting any of the blood-ve&s;&s;els,
retaining that part of the &s;hell where the mu&s;cles were in&s;erted; but it
died in three days after it was &s;tripped of its covering: not, however,
without making efforts to build up a new &s;hell; for, before its death, it
pre&s;&s;ed out a certain membrane round the whole &s;urface of its body. This
membrane was entirely of the &s;helly nature; and was intended, by the animal,
as a &s;upply towards a new one.</P>
<P>As the &s;nail is furni&s;hed with all the organs of life and
&s;en&s;ation, it is not wonderful to &s;ee it very voracious. It chiefly
&s;ub&s;i&s;ts upon the leaves of plants and trees; but is very delicate in its
choice. When the animal moves to &s;eek its food, it goes forward by means of
that broad mu&s;cular &s;kin which &s;ometimes is &s;een pro|jecting round the
mouth of the &s;hell; this is expanded before, and then contracted with a kind
of undulating motion, like a man at|tempting to move him&s;elf forward by one
arm, while lying on his belly. But the &s;nail has ano|ther advantage, by which
it not only &s;mooths and planes its way, but al&s;o can a&s;cend in the 
<PB N="25" REF="29"> mo&s;t perpendicular direction. This is by that &s;limy
&s;ub&s;tance with which it is &s;o copiou&s;ly fur|ni&s;hed, and which it
emits wherever it moves. Upon this &s;lime, as upon a kind of carpet, it
proceeds &s;lowly along, without any danger of wounding its tender body
again&s;t the a&s;perities of the pavement; by means of this it moves upwards
to its food upon trees; and by this de&s;cends, without danger of falling, and
breaking its &s;hell by the &s;hock.</P>
<P>The appetite of the&s;e animals is very great; and the damage
gardeners in particular &s;u&s;tain from them, makes them employ every method
for their de&s;truction. Salt will de&s;troy them, as well as &s;oot; but a
tortoi&s;e in a garden, is &s;aid to bani&s;h them much more effectually.</P>
<P>At the approach of winter, the &s;nail buries it&s;elf in the
earth; or retires to &s;ome hole, to continue in a torpid &s;tate, during the
&s;everity of the &s;ea&s;on. It is &s;ometimes &s;een alone; but more
frequently in company in its retreat; &s;everal being u&s;ually found together,
appa|rently deprived of life and &s;en&s;ation. For the purpo&s;es of
continuing in greater warmth and &s;ecurity, the &s;nail forms a cover or lid
to the mouth of its &s;hell with its &s;lime, which &s;tops it up entirely, and
thus protects it from every external danger. The matter of <PB N="26" REF="30">
which the cover is compo&s;ed, is whiti&s;h, &s;ome|what like plai&s;ter,
pretty hard and &s;olid, yet at the &s;ame time porous and thin, to admit air,
which the animal cannot live without. When the cover is formed too thick, the
&s;nail then breaks a little hole in it, which corrects the de|fect of that
clo&s;ene&s;s, which proceeded from too much caution. In this manner,
&s;heltered in its hole from the weather, defended in its &s;hell by a cover,
it &s;leeps during the winter; and, for &s;ix or &s;even months, continues
without food or motion, until the genial call of &s;pring breaks its &s;lumber,
and excites its activity.</P>
<P>The &s;nail, having &s;lept for &s;o long a &s;ea&s;on, wakes
one of the fir&s;t fine days of April; breaks open its cell, and &s;allies
forth to &s;eek for nou|ri&s;hment. It is not &s;urprizing that &s;o long a
fa&s;t &s;hould have thinned it, and rendered it very voracious. At fir&s;t,
therefore, it is not very difficult in the choice of its food; almo&s;t any
vegetable that is green, &s;eems welcome; but the &s;ucculent plants of the
garden are chiefly grateful; and the various kind of pul&s;e are, at &s;ome
&s;ea&s;ons, almo&s;t wholly de&s;troyed by their numbers. So great is the
multiplication of &s;nails at &s;ome years, that gardeners imagine they bur&s;t
from the earth. A wet &s;ea&s;on is generally fa|vourable to their production;
for this animal <PB N="27" REF="31"> cannot bear very dry &s;ea&s;ons, or dry
places, as they cau&s;e too great a con&s;umption of its &s;lime, without
plenty of which it cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t in health and vigour.</P>
<P>Such are the mo&s;t &s;triking particulars in the hi&s;tory of
this animal; and this may &s;erve as a general picture, to which the manners
and ha|bitudes of the other tribes of this cla&s;s may be compared and
referred. The&s;e are, the &s;ea &s;nail, of which naturali&s;ts have, from the
apparent dif|ference of their &s;hells, mentioned fifteen kinds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>D'Argenville's Conchyoligie.</BIBL></NOTE>; the
fre&s;h-water &s;nail, of which there are eight kinds; and the land-&s;nail, of
which there are five. The&s;e all bear a &s;trong re&s;emblance to the garden
&s;nail, in the formation of their &s;hell, in their hermaphrodite natures, in
the &s;limy &s;ub&s;tance with which they are covered, in the formation of
their inte&s;tines, and the di&s;po&s;ition of the hole on the right &s;ide of
the neck, which &s;erves at once for the di&s;charge of the faeces, for the
lodging the in&s;truments of generation, and for re&s;piration, when the animal
is under a nece&s;&s;ity of taking in a new &s;upply.</P>
<P>But in Nature, no two kinds of animals, however like each other
in figure or conform|ation, are of manners entirely the &s;ame. Though the
common garden &s;nail bears a very &s;trong <PB N="28" REF="32"> re&s;emblance
to that of fre&s;h-water, and that of the &s;ea, yet there are differences to
be found, and tho&s;e very con&s;iderable ones.</P>
<P>If we compare them with the fre&s;h-water &s;nail, though we
&s;hall find a general re&s;emblance, yet there are one or two remarkable
di&s;tinctions: and fir&s;t, the fre&s;h-water &s;nail, and, as I &s;hould
&s;uppo&s;e, all &s;nails that live in water, are pecu|liarly furni&s;hed with
a contrivance by Nature, for ri&s;ing to the &s;urface, or &s;inking to the
bot|tom. The manner in which this is performed, is by opening and &s;hutting
the orifice on the right &s;ide of the neck, which is furni&s;hed with
mu&s;cles for that purpo&s;e. The &s;nail &s;ometimes gathers this aperture
into an oblong tube, and &s;tretches or portends it above the &s;urface of the
water, in order to draw in or expel the air, as it finds occa&s;ion. This may
not only be &s;een, but heard al&s;o by the noi&s;e which the &s;nail makes in
moving the water. By dilating this it ri&s;es; by compre&s;&s;ing it, the
animal &s;inks to the bot|tom. This is effected &s;omewhat in the manner in
which little images of gla&s;s are made to ri&s;e or &s;ink in water, by
pre&s;&s;ing the air contained at the mouth of the tubes, &s;o that it &s;hall
drive the water into their hollow bodies, which before were filled only with
air, and thus make them heavier than the element in which they &s;wim. 
<PB N="29" REF="33"> In this manner does the fre&s;h-water &s;nail dive or
&s;wim, by properly managing the air con|tained in its body.</P>
<P>But what renders the&s;e animals far more worthy of notice is,
that they are viviparous, and bring forth their young not only alive, but with
their &s;hells upon their backs. This &s;eems &s;urprizing; yet it is
inconte&s;tably true: the young come to &s;ome degree of perfection in the womb
of the parent; there they receive their &s;tony coat; and from thence are
excluded, with a complete apparatus for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"On the twelfth of March," &s;ays Swam|merdam,
"I began my ob&s;ervations upon this &s;nail, and collected a great number of
the kind, which I put into a large ba&s;on filled with rain-water, and fed for
a long time with pot|ter's earth, di&s;&s;olved in the water about them. On the
thirteenth of the &s;ame month I opened one of the&s;e &s;nails, when I found
nine living &s;nails in its womb: the large&s;t of the&s;e were placed
foremo&s;t, as the fir&s;t candidates for exclu&s;ion. I put them into
fre&s;h-water, and they lived to the eighteenth of the &s;ame month, moving and
&s;wimming, like &s;nails full grown: nay their manner of &s;wimming was much
more beautiful."</Q> Thus, at what|ever time of the year the&s;e &s;nails are
opened, <PB N="30" REF="34"> they are &s;ound pregnant with eggs, or with
living &s;nails; or with both together.</P>
<P>This &s;triking difference between the fre&s;h-water and the
garden &s;nail, obtains al&s;o in &s;ome of the &s;ea kind; among which there
are &s;ome that are found viviparous, while others lay eggs in the u&s;ual
manner. Of this kind are one or two of the Buccinums; within which living young
have been frequently found, upon their di&s;&s;ection. In general, however, the
re&s;t of this numerous cla&s;s bring forth eggs; from whence the animal
bur&s;ts at a proper &s;tate of maturity, completely equipped with an hou&s;e,
which the moi&s;tne&s;s of the element where it re&s;ides does not prevent the
inhabitant from enlarging. How the &s;oft &s;lime of the &s;nail hardens, at
the bottom of the &s;ea, into the &s;tony &s;ub&s;tance of a &s;hell, is not
ea&s;y to conceive! This &s;lime mu&s;t at lea&s;t be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of very
powerful petrifying powers.</P>
<P>All animals of the &s;nail kind, as was ob|&s;erved before, are
hermaphrodites; each con|taining the in&s;truments of generation double. But
&s;ome of the &s;ea kinds copulate in a different manner from tho&s;e of the
garden. The one im|pregnates the other; but, from the po&s;ition of the parts,
is incapable of being impregnated by the &s;ame in turn. For this rea&s;on it
is ne|ce&s;&s;ary <PB N="31" REF="35"> for a third to be admitted as a partner
in this operation: &s;o that, while one impreg|nates that before it, another
does the &s;ame office by this; which is it&s;elf impregnated by a fourth. In
this manner, Mr. Adan&s;on has &s;een va&s;t numbers of &s;ea &s;nails, united
to|gether in a chain, impregnating each other. The <HI>bulin</HI> and the
<HI>coret</HI> perform the offices of male and female at the &s;ame time. The
orifices in the&s;e are two, both &s;eparate from each other: the opening by
which the animal performs the office of the male, being at the origin of the
horns; that by which it is pa&s;&s;ive, as the female, being farther down upon
the neck. It may al&s;o be ob&s;erved as a general rule, that all animals that
have this orifice, or verge, as &s;ome call it, on the right &s;ide, have their
&s;hells turned from the right to the left; on the contrary, tho&s;e which have
it on the left &s;ide, have their &s;hells turned from left to right, in a
contrary direction to the former.</P>
<P>But this is not the only difference between land and &s;ea
&s;nails. Many of the latter en|tirely want horns; and none of them have above
two. Indeed, if the horns of &s;nails be fur|ni&s;hed with eyes, and if, as
&s;ome are willing to think, the length of the horn, like the tube of a
tele&s;cope, a&s;&s;i&s;ts vi&s;ion, the&s;e animals, that <PB N="32" REF="36">
chiefly re&s;ide in the gloomy bottom of the deep, can have no great occa&s;ion
for them. Eyes would be unnece&s;&s;ary to creatures who&s;e food is u&s;ually
concealed in the darke&s;t places; and who, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of very little
motion, are obliged to grope for what they &s;ub&s;i&s;t on. To &s;uch, I
&s;ay, eyes would rather be an ob&s;truction than an advantage; and perhaps
even tho&s;e that live upon land are without them!</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that have &s;een the &s;hells of &s;ea &s;nails, need
not be told that the animal which produces them is larger than tho&s;e of the
&s;ame denomi|nation upon land. The &s;ea &s;eems to have the property of
enlarging the magnitude of all its inhabitants; and the &s;ame proportion that
a trout bears to a &s;hark, is often &s;een to obtain between a &s;hell bred
upon the land, and one bred in the ocean. Its convolutions are more numerous.
The garden &s;nail has but five turns at the mo&s;t; in the &s;ea &s;nail the
convolutions are &s;ometimes &s;een amounting to ten.</P>
<P>There is a difference al&s;o in the po&s;ition of the mouth, in
the garden and the water &s;nail. In the former, the mouth is placed
cro&s;swi&s;e, as in quadrupedes; furni&s;hed with jaw-bones, lips and teeth.
In mo&s;t of the &s;ea &s;nails, the mouth is placed longitudinally in the
head; <PB N="33" REF="37"> and, in &s;ome, obliquely, or on one &s;ide. Others,
of the Trochus kind, have no mouth what&s;oever; but are furni&s;hed with a
trunk, very long in &s;ome kinds, and &s;horter in others.</P>
<P>Snails of the Trochus kind, furni&s;hed thus with an
in&s;trument of offence, de&s;erve our par|ticular attention. The trunk of the
Trochus is fle&s;hy, mu&s;cular, &s;upple, and hollow. Its extremity is
bordered with a cartilage, and toothed like a &s;aw. The &s;nails that are
pro|vided with this, may be con&s;idered as the pre|dacious tribe, among their
fellows of the bottom. They are, among &s;nails, what the tiger, the eagle or
the &s;hark is among bea&s;ts, birds or fi&s;hes. The whole race of &s;helled
animals avoid their approach; for their habitations, however powerfully and
&s;trongly built, though never &s;o well fortified, yield to the &s;uperior
force of the&s;e invaders. Though provided with a thick clum&s;y &s;hell
them&s;elves, yet they move with greater &s;wiftne&s;s at the bottom than
mo&s;t other &s;hell fi&s;h; and &s;eize their prey with greater facility. No
&s;hell &s;o large but they will boldly venture to attack; and, with their
piercing augre-like trunk, will quickly bore it through. No efforts the other
animal makes can avail: it expands it&s;elf, and ri&s;es to the &s;urface; but
the enemy ri&s;es with it: it again &s;inks to the <PB N="34" REF="38"> bottom,
but &s;till its de&s;troyer clo&s;ely adheres. In this manner the carnivorous
&s;hell-fi&s;h, as &s;ome naturali&s;ts call it, &s;ticks for &s;everal days,
nay weeks, to its prey, until, with its trunk, it has &s;ucked out all
&s;ub&s;tance, or until it drops off when the other begins to putrefy.</P>
<P>Thus it would &s;eem throughout nature, that no animal is &s;o
well defended, but that others are found capable of breaking in upon its
entrenchments. The garden &s;nail &s;eems tolerably well guarded; but the wall
of its &s;hell is paper it&s;elf, in compari&s;on with that which fortifies
&s;ome of the &s;ea &s;nail kind. Be&s;ide this thick &s;hell, many of them are
al&s;o furni&s;hed with a lid, which covers the mouth of the &s;hell, and which
opens and &s;huts at the animal's plea&s;ure. When the creature hunts for food,
it opens its box, gropes or &s;wims about; and, when &s;atisfied, drops its lid
and &s;inks to the bottom: there it might be &s;uppo&s;ed to remain in perfect
&s;ecurity; but the trochus &s;oon finds the way to break into the thicke&s;t
part of its enclo&s;ure, and quickly de&s;troys it with the mo&s;t fatal
indu&s;try.</P>
<P>The being liable to the attacks of the trochus &s;eems to be a
calamity to which mo&s;t of this tribe are &s;ubject. Scarce a &s;hell is met
with entire and &s;ound to the end of its convolutions; but particularly the
thinne&s;t &s;hells are the mo&s;t <PB N="35" REF="39"> &s;ubject to be thus
invaded. As their &s;hells are ea&s;ily pierced, the predatory &s;hell-fi&s;h,
or the &s;ea-worm, chiefly &s;eek them for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; and of tho&s;e
thin paper-like &s;hells, not one in an hundred is found that has not
&s;uffered &s;ome di&s;a&s;ter. As they are lighter than other &s;hell-fi&s;h,
they &s;wim with greater ea&s;e; and this is the chief method of avoiding their
heavier thick &s;helled pur&s;uers. The food of all &s;nails properly lies at
the bottom; when, therefore, the nau|tilus, or other thin &s;helled fi&s;h, are
&s;een bu&s;ily &s;wimming at the &s;urface, it may be, that, in&s;tead of
&s;porting or &s;unning them&s;elves, as &s;ome are apt to &s;uppo&s;e, they
are actually labour|ing to e&s;cape their mo&s;t deadly pur&s;uers.</P>
<P>Of all &s;ea &s;nails, that which is mo&s;t frequently &s;een
&s;wimming upon the &s;urface, and who&s;e &s;hell is the thinne&s;t and mo&s;t
ea&s;ily pierced, is the Nautilus. Whether, upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, it is
employed in e&s;caping its numerous enemies at the bottom, or &s;eeking for
food at the &s;ur|face, I will not venture to decide. It &s;eems mo&s;t
probable, that the former is the cau&s;e of its frequently appearing; for, upon
opening the &s;tomach, it is found to contain chiefly that food which it finds
at the bottom. This ani|mal's indu&s;try, therefore, may be owing to its 
<PB N="36" REF="40"> fears; and all tho&s;e arts of &s;ailing, which it has
taught mankind, may have been originally the product of nece&s;&s;ity. But the
nautilus is too fa|mous not to demand a more ample de&s;cription.</P>
<P>Although there be &s;everal &s;pecies of the nau|tilus, yet they
all may be divided into two: the one with a white &s;hell, as thin as paper,
which it often is &s;een to quit, and again to re&s;ume; the other with a
thicker &s;hell, &s;ome|times of a beautiful mother-of-pearl colour, and that
quits its &s;hell but rarely. This &s;hell out|wardly re&s;embles that of a
large &s;nail, but is generally &s;ix or eight inches acro&s;s: within, it is
divided into forty partitions, that commu|nicate with each other by doors, if I
may &s;o call them, through which one could not thru&s;t a goo&s;e-quill:
almo&s;t the whole internal part of the &s;hell is filled by the animal; the
body of which, like its habitation, is divided into as many parts as there are
chambers in its &s;hell: all the parts of its body communicate with each other,
through the doors or openings, by a long blood-ve&s;&s;el, which runs from the
head to the tail: thus the body of the animal, if taken out of the &s;hell, may
be likened to a number of &s;oft bits of fle&s;h, of which there are forty,
threaded upon a &s;tring. From this extraordinary conformation, one would not
be apt to &s;uppo&s;e <PB N="37" REF="41"> that the nautilus &s;ometimes
quitted its &s;hell, and returned to it again; yet nothing, though &s;eemingly
more impo&s;&s;ible, is more certain. The manner by which it contrives to
di&s;engage every part of its body from &s;o intricate an ha|bitation; by which
it makes a &s;ub&s;tance, to ap|pearance as thick as one's wri&s;t, pa&s;s
through forty doors, each of which would &s;carcely admit a goo&s;e-quill, is
not yet di&s;covered: but the fact is certain; for the animal is often found
without its &s;hell; and the &s;hell more frequently de&s;titute of the animal.
It is mo&s;t probable, that it has a power of making the &s;ub&s;tance of one
&s;ection of its body remove up into that which is next; and thus, by
multiplied removals, it gets free.</P>
<P>But this, though very &s;trange, is not the pe|culiarity for
which the nautilus has been the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed. Its &s;preading the
thin oar, and catching the flying gale, to u&s;e the poet's de&s;cription of
it, has chiefly excited human cu|rio&s;ity. The&s;e animals, particularly
tho&s;e of the white, light kind, are chiefly found in the Me|diterranean; and
&s;carce any who have &s;ailed on that &s;ea, but mu&s;t often have &s;een
them. When the &s;ea is calm, they are ob&s;erved floating on the &s;urface;
&s;ome &s;preading their little &s;ail; <PB N="38" REF="42"> &s;ome rowing with
their feet, as if for life and death; and others &s;till, floating upon their
mouths, like a &s;hip with the keel upward. If taken while thus employed, and
examined, the extraordinary mechani&s;m of their limbs for &s;ailing will
appear more manife&s;t. The nau|tilus is furni&s;hed with eight feet, which
i&s;&s;ue near the mouth, and may as properly be called barbs: the&s;e are
connected to each other by a thin &s;kin, like that between the toes of a duck,
but much thinner and more tran&s;parent. Of the&s;e eight feet thus connected,
&s;ix are &s;hort, and the&s;e are held up as &s;ails to catch the wind in
&s;ailing: the two others are longer, and are kept in the water; &s;erving,
like paddles, to &s;teer their cour&s;e by. When the weather is quite calm, and
the animal is pur&s;ued from below, it is then &s;een expanding only a part of
its &s;ail, and rowing with the re&s;t: whenever it is inter|rupted, or fears
danger from above, it in&s;tantly furls the &s;ail, catches in all its oars,
turns its &s;hell mouth downward, and in&s;tantly &s;inks to the bottom.
Sometimes al&s;o it is &s;een pumping the water from its leaking hulk; and,
when unfit for &s;ailing, de&s;erts its &s;hell entirely. The for&s;aken hulk
is &s;een floating along, till it da&s;hes, by a kind of &s;hipwreck, upon the
rocks or the &s;hore.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="43">From the above de&s;cription, I think we may
con|&s;ider this animal rather as attempting to &s;ave it&s;elf from the
attacks of its de&s;troyers, than as rowing in pur&s;uit of food. Certain it
is, that no creature of the deep has more numerous and more powerful enemies.
Its &s;hell is &s;carcely ever found in perfect pre&s;ervation; but is
generally &s;een to bear &s;ome marks of ho&s;tile inva&s;ion. Its little arts,
therefore, upon the &s;urface of the water, may have been given it for
pro|tection; and it may be thus endued with com|parative &s;wiftne&s;s, to
avoid the crab, the &s;ea-&s;corpion, the trochus, and all the &s;lower
pre|dacious reptiles that lurk for it at the bottom of the water.</P>
<P>From this general view of &s;nails, they appear to be a much
more active, animated tribe, than from their figure one would at fir&s;t
con|ceive. They &s;eem, to an inattentive &s;pectator, as mere inert ma&s;&s;es
of &s;oft fle&s;h, rather loaded than covered with a &s;hell, &s;carcely
capable of motion, and in&s;en&s;ible to all the objects around them. When
viewed more clo&s;ely, they are found to be furni&s;hed with the organs of life
and &s;en&s;ation in tolerable perfection: they are de|fended with armour, that
is at once both light and &s;trong; they are as active as their nece&s;&s;ities
<PB N="40" REF="44"> require; and are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of appetites more
poignant than tho&s;e of animals that &s;eem much more perfectly formed. In
&s;hort, they are a fruitful indu&s;trious tribe; furni&s;hed, like all other
animals, with the powers of e&s;cape and inva&s;ion; they have their pur&s;uits
and their enmities; and, of all creatures of the deep, they have mo&s;t to fear
from each other.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of Bivalved Shell-Fi&s;h, or Shells of the
Oy&s;ter Kind.</HEAD>
<P>IT may &s;eem whim&s;ical to make a di&s;tinction between the
animal perfections of turbinated and bivalved &s;hell-fi&s;h, or to grant a
degree of &s;u|periority to the &s;nail above the oy&s;ter. Yet this
di&s;tinction &s;trongly and apparently obtains in nature; and we &s;hall find
the bivalved tribe of animals in every re&s;pect inferior to tho&s;e we have
been de&s;cribing. Inferior in all their &s;en|&s;ations; inferior in their
powers of motion; but particularly inferior in their &s;y&s;tem of animal
generation. The &s;nail tribe, as we &s;aw, are hermaphrodite, but require the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of each other for fecundation; all the bivalve tribe are
hermaphrodite in like manner, but they require no a&s;&s;i&s;tance from each
other towards impregnation; and a &s;ingle mu&s;cle or oy&s;ter, if there were
no other in the world, would quickly repleni&s;h the ocean. As the land &s;nail
from its being be&s;t known took the lead in the former cla&s;s, &s;o the
fre&s;h-water mu&s;cle, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, may take lead in this. The
life and manners of &s;uch as belong to the &s;ea will be be&s;t di&s;played in
the compari&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="46">The mu&s;cle, as is well known, whether
be|longing to fre&s;h or &s;alt-water, con&s;i&s;ts of two equal &s;hells,
joined at the back by a &s;trong mu&s;cular ligament that an&s;wers all the
purpo&s;es of an hinge. By the ela&s;tic contraction of the&s;e, the animal can
open its &s;hells at plea&s;ure, about a quarter of an inch from each other.
The fi&s;h is fixed to either &s;hell by four tendons, by means of which it
&s;huts them clo&s;e, and keeps its body firm from being cru&s;hed by any
&s;hock again&s;t the walls of its own habitation. It is furni&s;hed, like all
other animals of this kind, with vital organs, though the&s;e are &s;ituated in
a very extraordinary manner. It has a mouth furni&s;hed with two fle&s;hy lips;
its inte&s;tine begins at the bottom of the mouth, pa&s;&s;es through the
brain, and makes a number of cir|cumvolutions through the liver; on leaving
this organ, it goes on &s;traight into the heart, which it penetrates, and ends
in the anus; near which the lungs are placed, and through which it breathes,
like tho&s;e of the &s;nail kind; and in this manner its languid circulation is
carried on<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>M. Mery. Anat. de Moule's
d'Etang.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>But the organs of generation are what mo&s;t de&s;erve to excite
our curio&s;ity. The&s;e con&s;i&s;t in each mu&s;cle of two ovaries, which are
the fe|male part of its furniture, and of two &s;eminal <PB N="43" REF="47">
ve&s;&s;els re&s;embling what are found in the male. Each ovary and each
&s;eminal ve&s;&s;el has its own proper canal; by the ovary canal the eggs
de|&s;cend to the anus; and there al&s;o the &s;eminal canals &s;end their
fluids to impregnate them. By this contrivance, one &s;ingle animal &s;uffices
for the double purpo&s;es of generation; and the eggs are excluded and
impregnated by it&s;elf alone.</P>
<P>As the mu&s;cle is thus furni&s;hed with a kind of
&s;elf-creating power, there are few places where it breeds that it is not
found in great abundance. The ovaries u&s;ually empty them|&s;elves of their
eggs in &s;pring, and they are re|pleni&s;hed in autumn. For this rea&s;on they
are found empty in &s;ummer and full in winter. They produce in great numbers,
as all bivalved &s;hell-fi&s;h are found to do. The fecundity of the &s;nail
kind is trifling in compari&s;on to the fertility of the&s;e. Indeed it may be
a&s;&s;erted as a general rule in nature, that the more helple&s;s and
contemptible the animal, the more prolific it is always found. Thus all
creatures that are in|capable of re&s;i&s;ting their de&s;troyers, have nothing
but their quick multiplication, for the conti|nuation of their exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>The multitude of the&s;e animals in &s;ome places is very great;
but, from their defencelefs &s;tate, <PB N="44" REF="48"> the number of their
de&s;troyers are in equal proportion. The crab, the cray-fi&s;h, and many other
animals, are &s;een to devour them; but the trochus is their mo&s;t formidable
enemy. When their &s;hells are found de&s;erted, if we then ob&s;erve
clo&s;ely, it is mo&s;t probable we &s;hall find that the trochus has been at
work in piercing them. There is &s;carce one of them without a hole in it; and
this probably was the avenue by which the enemy entered to de&s;troy the
inhabitant.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding the number of this crea|ture's animated
enemies, it &s;eems &s;till more fearful of the agitations of the element in
which it re&s;ides; for if da&s;hed again&s;t rocks, or thrown far on the
beach, it is de&s;troyed without a power of redre&s;s. In order to guard
again&s;t the&s;e, which are to this animal the commone&s;t and the mo&s;t
fatal accidents, although it has a power of &s;low motion, which I &s;hall
pre&s;ently de&s;cribe, yet it endeavours to become &s;tationary, and to attach
it&s;elf to any fixed object it happens to be near. For this purpo&s;e it is
furni&s;hed with a very &s;ingular capacity of binding it&s;elf by a number of
threads to whatever object it approaches; and the&s;e Reaumur &s;uppo&s;ed it
&s;pun artificially, as &s;piders their webs which they fa&s;ten again&s;t a
wall. Of this however, latter <PB N="45" REF="49"> philo&s;ophers have found
very great rea&s;on to doubt. It is therefore &s;uppo&s;ed that the&s;e
threads, which are u&s;ually called the beard of the mu&s;cle, are the natural
growth of the animal's body, and by no means produced at plea&s;ure. Indeed,
the extreme length of this beard in &s;ome, which far exceeds the length of the
body, &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible to be manufactured by the thru&s;ting out and
drawing in of the tongue, with the glutinous matter of which the French
philo&s;opher &s;uppo&s;ed tho&s;e threads were form|ed. It is even found to
encrea&s;e with the growth of the animal; and as the mu&s;cle be|comes larger
and older, the beard becomes longer and its filaments more &s;trong<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Mercier du Paty, &s;ur le bouchots a moules. Tom. ii. de
l'Academie de la Rochelle.</BIBL></NOTE>. Be this as it will, nothing is more
certain than that the mu&s;cle is found attached by the&s;e threads to every
fixed object; &s;ometimes, indeed, for want of &s;uch an object, the&s;e
animals are found united to each other; and though thrown into a lake
&s;eparately, they are taken out in bunches of many together.</P>
<P>To have &s;ome fixed re&s;ting place where the mu&s;cle can
continue, and take in its accidental food, &s;eems the &s;tate that this animal
chiefly de&s;ires. Its in&s;trument of motion, by which <PB N="46" REF="50"> it
contrives to reach the object it wants to bind it&s;elf to, is that mu&s;cular
&s;ub&s;tance re&s;embling a tongue, which is found long in proportion to the
&s;ize of the mu&s;cle. In &s;ome it is two inches long, in others not a third
part of the&s;e dimen|&s;ions. This the animal has a power of thru&s;ting out
of its &s;hell; and with this it is capable of making a &s;light furrow in the
&s;and at the bottom. By means of this furrow it can erect it&s;elf upon the
edge of its &s;hell; and thus continuing to make the furrow in proportion as it
goes for|ward, it reaches out its tongue, that an&s;wers the purpo&s;e of an
arm, and thus carries its &s;hell edge-ways, as in a grove, until it reaches
the point intended. There where it determines to take up its re&s;idence it
fixes the ends of its beard, which are glutinous, to the rock or the object,
whatever it be; and thus, like a &s;hip at anchor, braves all the agitations of
the water. Sometimes the animal is attached by a large number of threads;
&s;ometimes but by three or four, that &s;eem &s;carce able to retain it. When
the mu&s;cle is fixed in this manner, it lives upon the little earthy particles
that the water tran&s;|ports to its &s;hells, and perhaps the fle&s;h of the
mo&s;t diminutive animals. However, it does not fail to grow con&s;iderably;
and &s;ome of this kind have been found a foot long. I have &s;een 
<PB N="47" REF="51"> the beards a foot and an half; and of this &s;ub|&s;tance
the natives of Palermo &s;ometimes make gloves and &s;tockings.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;hell-fi&s;h are found in lakes, rivers, and in the
&s;ea. Tho&s;e of the lake often grow to a very large &s;ize; but they &s;eem a
&s;olitary animal, and are found generally &s;eparate from each other. Tho&s;e
of rivers are not &s;o large, but yet in greater abundance; but the &s;ea
mu&s;cle of all others is perhaps the mo&s;t plenty. The&s;e are often bred
artificially in &s;alt-water mar&s;hes that are overflowed by the tide; the
fi&s;hermen throwing them in at the proper &s;ea&s;ons; and there being
undi&s;turbed by the agitations of the &s;ea, and not preyed upon by their
powerful enemies at the bottom, they ca&s;t their eggs, which &s;oon become
perfect animals, and the&s;e are generally found in clu&s;ters of &s;everal
dozen together. It requires a year for the peopling a mu&s;cle-bed; &s;o that,
if the number con&s;i&s;ts of forty thou&s;and, a tenth part may annually be
left for the peopling the bed anew. Mu&s;cles are taken from their beds from
the month of July to October; and they are &s;old at a very moderate price.</P>
<P>From this animal the oy&s;ter differs very little, except in the
thickne&s;s of its &s;hell, and its greater imbecility. The oy&s;ter, like the
mu&s;cle, <PB N="48" REF="52"> is formed with organs of life and re&s;piration,
with inte&s;tines which are very voluminous, a liver, lungs, and heart. Like
the mu&s;cle, it is &s;elf-impregnated; and the &s;hell, which the animal
&s;oon acquires, &s;erves it for its future habitation. Like the mu&s;cle, it
opens its &s;hell to receive the influx of water; and like that animal is
&s;trongly attached to its &s;hells both above and below.</P>
<P>But it differs in many particulars. In the fir&s;t place its
&s;hells are not equal, the one being cupped, the other flat; upon the cupped
&s;hell it is always &s;een to re&s;t; for if it lay upon the flat &s;ide it
would then lo&s;e all its water. It differs al&s;o in the thickne&s;s of its
&s;hells, which are &s;o &s;trongly lined and defended, that no animal will
attempt to pierce them. But though the oy&s;ter be &s;ecured from the attacks
of the &s;mall reptiles at the bottom, yet it often &s;erves as an object to
which they are attached. Pipe|worms and other little animals fix their
habi|tation to the oy&s;ter's &s;ides, and in this manner continue to live in
&s;ecurity. Among the number of the&s;e is a little red worm, that is often
found upon the &s;hell; which &s;ome, from never &s;eeing oy&s;ters copulate,
erroneou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;ed to be the male by which their &s;pawn was
impregnated.</P>
<P>The oy&s;ter differs al&s;o from the mu&s;cle in 
<PB N="49" REF="53"> being utterly unable to change its &s;ituation. The
mu&s;cle, as we have ob&s;erved, is capable of erecting it&s;elf on an edge,
and going forward with a &s;low laborious motion. The oy&s;ter is wholly
pa&s;&s;ive, and endeavours by all its powers to re&s;t fixed to one &s;pot at
the bottom. It is entirely without that tongue which we &s;aw an|&s;wering the
purpo&s;es of an arm in the other animal; but neverthele&s;s is often attached
very firmly to any object it happens to approach. Rocks, &s;tones, pieces of
timber, or &s;ea-weeds, all &s;eem proper to give it a fixture, and to
&s;e|cure it again&s;t the agitation of the waves. Nothing &s;o common in the
rivers of the tropical climates as to &s;ee oy&s;ters growing even amid&s;t the
branches of the fore&s;t. Many trees which grow along the banks of the &s;tream
often bend their branches into the water, and particularly the mangrove, which
chiefly delights in a moi&s;t &s;ituation. To the&s;e the oy&s;ters hang in
clu&s;ters, like apples upon the mo&s;t fertile tree; and in proportion as the
weight of the fi&s;h &s;inks the plant into the water, where it &s;till
continues growing, the number of oy&s;ters encrea&s;e, and hang upon the
branches. Thus there is nothing that the&s;e &s;hell fi&s;h will not &s;tick
to; they are often even found to &s;tick to each other. This is effected by
means of a glue proper to <PB N="50" REF="54"> them&s;elves, which, when it
cements, the join|ing is as hard as the &s;hell, and is as diffi|cultly broken.
The joining &s;ub&s;tance, however, is not always of glue; but the animal grows
to the rocks, &s;omewhat like the mu&s;cle, by threads; although the&s;e are
only &s;een to take root in the &s;hell, and not, as in the mu&s;cle, to
&s;pring from the body of the fi&s;h it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Oy&s;ters u&s;ually ca&s;t their &s;pawn in May, which at
fir&s;t appear like drops of candle-grea&s;e, and &s;tick to any hard
&s;ub&s;tance they fall upon. The&s;e are covered with a &s;hell in two or
three days; and in three years the animal is large enough to be brought to
market. As they invariably remain in the places where they are laid, and as
they grow without any other &s;eeming food than the afflux of &s;ea-water, it
is the cu&s;tom at Colche&s;ter, and other parts of the kingdom, where the tide
&s;ettles in mar&s;hes on land, to pick up great quantities of &s;mall
oy&s;ters along the &s;hore, which when fir&s;t gathered &s;eldom exceed the
&s;ize of a &s;ixpence. The&s;e are depo&s;ited in beds where the tide comes
in, and in two or three years grow to a tolerable &s;ize. They are &s;aid to be
better ta&s;ted for being thus &s;heltered from the agitations of the deep; and
a mixture of fre&s;h-water en|tering into the&s;e repo&s;itories, is &s;aid to
improve <PB N="51" REF="55"> their flavour, and to encrea&s;e their growth and
fatne&s;s.</P>
<P>The oy&s;ters, however, which are prepared in this manner, are
by no means &s;o large as tho&s;e found &s;ticking to rocks at the bottom of
the &s;ea, u&s;ually called rock-oy&s;ters. The&s;e are &s;ometimes found as
broad as a plate, and are admired by &s;ome as excellent food. But what is the
&s;ize of the&s;e compared to the oy&s;ters of the Ea&s;t-Indies, &s;ome of
who&s;e &s;hells I have &s;een two feet over! The oy&s;ters found along the
coa&s;t of Coromandel are capable of furni&s;hing a plentiful meal to eight or
ten men; but it &s;eems univer&s;ally agreed that they are no way comparable to
ours for delicacy or flavour.</P>
<P>Thus the mu&s;cle and the oy&s;ter appear to have but few
di&s;tinctions except in their &s;hape and the power of motion in the former.
Other bivalved &s;hell-fi&s;h, &s;uch as the cockle, the &s;cal|lop, and the
razor &s;hell, have differences equally minute. The power of changing place,
which &s;ome of them effect in a manner quite peculiar to them&s;elves, makes
their greate&s;t difference. The &s;callop is particularly remarkable for its
method of moving forward upon land, or &s;wimming upon the &s;urface of the
water. When this animal finds it&s;elf de&s;erted by the tide, it makes very
remarkable efforts to regain the <PB N="52" REF="56"> water, moving towards the
&s;ea in a mo&s;t &s;in|gular manner. It fir&s;t gapes with its &s;hell as
widely as it can, the edges being often an inch a&s;under; then it &s;huts them
with a jerk, and by this the whole animal ri&s;es five or &s;ix inches from the
ground. It thus tumbles any how forward, and then renews the operation until it
has attained its journey's end. When in the water it is capable of &s;upporting
it&s;elf upon the &s;urface; and there opening and &s;hutting its &s;hells, it
tumbles over and over, and makes its way with &s;ome celerity.</P>
<P>The Pivot or razor &s;hell has a very different kind of motion.
As the former moves labo|riou&s;ly and &s;lowly forward, &s;o the razor &s;hell
has only a power of &s;inking point downward. The &s;hells of this animal
re&s;emble nothing &s;o much as the haft of a razor; and by this form it is
better enabled to dive into the &s;oft &s;and at the bottom. All the motions of
this little animal are confined to &s;inking or ri&s;ing a foot downwards or
upwards in the &s;and, for it never leaves the &s;pot where fir&s;t it was
planted. From time to time it is &s;een to ri&s;e about half way out of its
hole; but if any way di&s;turbed, it &s;inks perpendicularly down again. Ju&s;t
over the place where the razor buries it&s;elf, there is a &s;mall hole like a
chimney, through which the animal breathes, <PB N="53" REF="57"> or imbibes the
&s;ea-water. Upon the de&s;ertion of the tide, the&s;e holes are ea&s;ily
di&s;tingui&s;hed by the fi&s;hermen who &s;eek for it; and their method of
enticing the razor up from the depth of its retreat is by &s;prinkling a little
&s;ea-&s;alt upon the hole. This melting, no &s;ooner reaches the razor below
than it ri&s;es in&s;tantly &s;traight upwards, and &s;hews about half its
length above the &s;urface. This appearance however is in&s;tantaneous; and if
the fi&s;her does not &s;eize the opportunity, the razor buries it&s;elf with
great ea&s;e to its former depth. There it continues &s;ecure; no &s;alt can
allure it a &s;econd time; but it remains unmole&s;ted, unle&s;s the fi&s;her
will be at the trouble of digging it out &s;ometimes two feet below the
&s;urface.</P>
<P>Such are the minute differences between bi|valved
&s;hell-fi&s;h; but in the great out-lines of their nature they exactly
re&s;emble each other. It is particularly in this cla&s;s of &s;hell-fi&s;h
that pearls are found in greate&s;t abundance; and it is in the internal parts
of tho&s;e &s;hells that are of a &s;hining &s;ilvery colour that the&s;e gems
are u&s;ually generated; but the pearl is al&s;o found to breed as well in the
mu&s;cle or the &s;callop as in the oy&s;ter. In fact it is found in all
bi|valved &s;hells, the in&s;ides of which re&s;emble that well known
&s;ub&s;tance called mother of pearl.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="58">Whether pearls be a di&s;ea&s;e or an
accident in the animal is &s;carce worth enquiry. The com|mon opinion is, that
they are a kind of calculous concretion in the body of the animal, &s;omewhat
re&s;embling a &s;tone in the bladder, and are con|&s;equently to be
con&s;idered as a di&s;order. It is &s;aid, in confirmation of this opinion,
that tho&s;e coa&s;ts upon which pearls are fi&s;hed are very un|healthy; and
therefore mo&s;t probably oy&s;ters &s;hare the general influence of the
climate; it is al&s;o added that tho&s;e oy&s;ters in which pearls are found
are always ill-ta&s;ted, which is a &s;ign of their being unfound; and
la&s;tly, it is a&s;&s;erted that the pearl grows &s;ometimes &s;o big as to
keep the &s;hells of the animal from &s;hutting, and that thus it dies by being
expo&s;ed. It is ea&s;y to &s;ee the weakne&s;s of the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions,
which &s;eem neither true nor amu&s;ing. To an&s;wer them in their own way, if
a &s;tone in the bladder be a di&s;order, a &s;tone in the &s;tomach of an
o&s;trich is a benefit, and &s;o it may be in the &s;hell of an oy&s;ter. If
the &s;hores where the pearls are fi&s;hed be unwhole&s;ome to man, that,
in&s;tead of being di&s;advantageous, is &s;o much the more lucky for the
oy&s;ter. If the pearl oy&s;ters are the wor&s;t ta&s;ted, &s;o are kites and
ravens among birds; and yet we know that they are healthy and long-lived
animals: if the oy&s;ter had ever <PB N="55" REF="59"> its &s;hell kept
a&s;under by the pearl within it, that would be a di&s;ea&s;e indeed: but this
in reality never happens; for the oy&s;ter that breeds a large pearl always
breeds a large &s;hell, and the &s;hell it&s;elf indents to receive its
impre&s;&s;ion. The pearl upon the whole &s;eems bred from no di&s;|order in
the animal, but accidentally produced by the &s;ame matter that goes to form
the &s;hell. This &s;ub&s;tance, which is &s;oft at fir&s;t, quickly hardens;
and thus, by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive coats, layer over layer, the pearl acquires its
dimen&s;ions. If cut through, it will be found to con&s;i&s;t of &s;everal
coats, like an onion; and &s;ometimes a &s;mall &s;peck is &s;een in the
middle, upon which the coats were originally formed.</P>
<P>All oy&s;ters, and mo&s;t &s;hell-fi&s;h, are found to contain
pearls; but that which particularly obtains the name of the pearl oy&s;ter, has
a large &s;trong whiti&s;h &s;hell, wrinkled and rough with|out, and within
&s;mooth and of a &s;ilver colour. From the&s;e the mother-of-pearl is taken,
which is nothing more than the internal coats of the &s;hell, re&s;embling the
pearl in colour and con|&s;i&s;tence. This is taken out and &s;haped into that
variety of uten&s;ils which are found &s;o beautiful; but the pearl it&s;elf is
chiefly prized; being found but in few oy&s;ters, and generally adhering,
&s;ometimes making a print in the body <PB N="56" REF="60"> of the &s;hell,
&s;ometimes at large within the &s;ub|&s;tance of the fi&s;h.</P>
<P>There are a great number of pearl fi&s;heries in America and
A&s;ia; but as pearls bear a wor&s;e price than formerly, tho&s;e of America
are in a great mea&s;ure di&s;continued. The mo&s;t famous of all the A&s;iatic
fi&s;heries is in the Per&s;ian Gulph, near the I&s;le of Bahren. There is
another be|tween the coa&s;t of Madura and the I&s;land of Ceylon; and there
was a third on the coa&s;ts of Japan: but as the&s;e noble i&s;landers have a
con|tempt for jewels, and an abhorrence for &s;uch Europeans as come in
pur&s;uit of them, that fi&s;hery which is thought to be the mo&s;t valuable of
all others is di&s;continued. The diving bu|&s;ine&s;s is now carried on only
in tho&s;e countries where the wretchedne&s;s of one part of mankind goes to
&s;upport the magnificence of the other.</P>
<P>The chief fi&s;hery, as was &s;aid, is carried on in the
Per&s;ian Gulph, and the mo&s;t valuable pearls are brought from thence. The
value of the&s;e jewels encrea&s;es not only in proportion to their &s;ize, but
al&s;o their figure and colour; for &s;ome pearls are white, others are
yellowi&s;h, others of a lead colour; and &s;ome affirm they have been found as
black as jet. What it is that gives the&s;e different tinctures to pearls is
not known; Taverner a&s;cribes it to their lying <PB N="57" REF="61"> two or
three weeks upon &s;hore after the oy&s;ter is taken; Reaumur thinks it
proceeds from the colour of that part of the fi&s;h's body upon which the pearl
lies It is mo&s;t probable that this colour proceeds, like the &s;pots
frequently found on the internal &s;urface of the &s;hell it&s;elf, from &s;ome
accident while the pearl is growing.</P>
<P>The be&s;t coloured pearls and the rounde&s;t are brought from
the Ea&s;t; tho&s;e of America are neither &s;o white nor &s;o exactly oval.
All pearls however in time become yellow; they may be con&s;idered as an animal
&s;ub&s;tance con|verted into a &s;tony hardne&s;s, and like ivory taking a
tincture from the air. They have been even found to decay when kept in damp or
vaulted places, and to moulder into a &s;ub|&s;tance &s;carce harder than
chalk. When the daughters of Stilicon, that were both betrothed, one after the
other, to the emperor Honorius, were buried, much of their finery was al&s;o
de|po&s;ited with them in the &s;ame tomb. In this manner they remained buried
for above eleven hundred years, till the foundations of the church of St. Peter
were laying. Their tomb was then di&s;covered, and all their finery was found
in to|lerable pre&s;ervation except their pearls, which were converted by time
and damps into a chalky powder.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="62">The wretched people that are de&s;tined to
fi&s;h for pearls, are either Negroes of &s;ome of the poore&s;t of the natives
of Per&s;ia. The inhabitants of this country are divided into tyrants and
&s;laves. The divers are not only &s;ubject to the dangers of the deep, to
tempe&s;ts, to &s;uffocation at the bottom, to being devoured by &s;harks, but
from their profe&s;&s;ion univer&s;ally labour under a &s;pitting of blood,
occa&s;ioned by the pre&s;&s;ure of air upon their lungs in going down to the
bottom. The mo&s;t robu&s;t and healthy young men are cho&s;en for this
employment, but they &s;eldom &s;urvive it above five or &s;ix years. Their
fibres become rigid; their eye|balls turn red; and they u&s;ually die
con&s;umptive.</P>
<P>It is amazing how very long they are &s;een to continue at the
bottom. Some, as we are a&s;&s;ured, have been known to continue three quarters
of an hour under water without breathing; and to one unu&s;ed to diving, ten
minutes would &s;uffo|cate the &s;tronge&s;t. Whether from &s;ome effort the
blood bur&s;ts the old pa&s;&s;age which it had in the foetus, and circulates
without going through the lungs, it is not ea&s;y to tell; but certain it is
that &s;ome bodies have been di&s;&s;ected with this canal of communication
open, and the&s;e extraordinary divers may be internally formed in that
manner.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="63">Be this as it may, no way of life &s;eems
&s;o laborious, &s;o dangerous, or &s;o painful. They fi&s;h for pearls, or
rather the oy&s;ters that contain them, in boats twenty-eight feet long; and of
the&s;e there are &s;ometimes three or four hundred at a time, with each
&s;even or eight &s;tones, which &s;erve for anchors. There are from five to
eight divers belonging to each, that dive one after another. They are quite
naked, except that they have a net hanging down from the neck to put their
oy&s;ters in, and gloves on their hands to defend them while they pick the
oy&s;ters from the holes in the rocks; for in this manner alone can they be
gathered. Every diver is &s;unk by means of a &s;tone, weighing fifty pounds,
tied to the rope by which he de|&s;cends. He places his foot in a kind of
&s;tirrup, and laying hold of the rope with his left hand, with his right he
&s;tops his no&s;e to keep in his breath, as upon going down he takes in a very
long in&s;piration. They are no &s;ooner come to the bottom, but they give the
&s;ignal to tho&s;e who are in the boat to draw up the &s;tone; which done,
they go to work, filling their net as fa&s;t as they can; and then giving
another &s;ignal, the boats above pull up the net loaded with oy&s;ters, and
&s;hortly after the diver him&s;elf to take a new in&s;piration. They dive 
<PB N="60" REF="64"> to the depth of fifteen fathoms, and &s;eldom go deeper.
They generally go every morning by break of day to this fatiguing employment,
taking the land wind to waft them out to &s;ea, and returning with the
&s;ea-breeze at night. The owners of the boats u&s;ually hire the divers, and
the re&s;t of the boats crew, as we do our la|bourers, at &s;o much a day. All
the oy&s;ters are brought on &s;hore, where they are laid in a great heap till
the pearl fi&s;hery is over, which continues during the months of November and
December. When opportunity &s;erves, they then examine every oy&s;ter, and it
is accidental whe|ther the capture turns out advantageous. In|deed no human
being can wi&s;h well to a com|merce, which thus chains &s;uch a number of
fellow creatures to the bottom, to pluck up a glittering mouldering pebble.</P>

<P><PB N="61" REF="66">MULTIVALVE SHELL-FISH may be con|&s;idered
as animals &s;hut up in round boxes. To view their habitations externally, one
would be little apt to con&s;ider them as the retreats of living creatures; and
&s;till le&s;s, to &s;uppo&s;e that &s;ome of them carry their boxes with a
tolerable &s;hare of &s;wiftne&s;s, &s;o as to e&s;cape their pur&s;uers. Of
the&s;e there are principally two kinds; &s;uch as move, and &s;uch as are
&s;tationary: the fir&s;t are u&s;ually known in our cabinets by the name of
&s;ea-eggs; the others are as often admired, from the cavities which they
&s;coop out for their habitation in the harde&s;t marble. The fir&s;t are
called, by naturali&s;ts, Echini, or Urchins: the latter are called Pholades,
or File Fi&s;h. Of both there are &s;everal &s;orts; but, by de&s;cribing
the&s;e two, we &s;hall have a competent idea of all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>To a &s;light view, the &s;ea urchin may be com|pared to the
hu&s;k of a che&s;tnut; being like it round, and with a number of bony prickles
&s;tanding out on every &s;ide. To exhibit this extraordinary animal in every
light&mdash;if we could conceive a turnip &s;tuck full of pins on every 
<PB N="62" REF="67"> &s;ide, and running upon the&s;e pins with &s;ome degree
of &s;wiftne&s;s, we &s;hould have &s;ome idea of this extraordinary creature.
The mouth is placed downwards; the vent is above; the &s;hell is a hollow
va&s;e, re&s;embling a &s;cooped apple; and this filled with a &s;oft,
mu&s;|cular &s;ub&s;tance, through which the inte&s;tines wind from the bottom
to the top. The mouth, which is placed undermo&s;t, is large and red,
furni&s;hed with five &s;harp teet, which are ea&s;ily di&s;cerned. The jaws
are &s;trengthened by five &s;mall bones, in the centre of which is a &s;mall
fle&s;hy tongue; and from this the inte&s;tines make a winding of five
&s;pires, round the internal &s;ides of the &s;hell, ending at top, where the
excrements are excluded. But what makes the mo&s;t ex|traordinary part of this
animal's conformation, are its horns and its &s;pines, that point from every
part of the body, like the horns of a &s;nail, and that &s;erve at once as legs
to move upon, as arms to feel with, and as in&s;truments of capture and
defence. Between the&s;e horns it has al&s;o &s;pines that are not endued with
&s;uch a &s;hare of motion. The &s;pines and the horns i&s;&s;ue from every
part of its body; the &s;pines being hard and prickly; the horns being &s;oft,
longer than the &s;pines, and never &s;een except in the water. They are put
forward and withdrawn like the <PB REF="68">

</FIGURE> <PB N="63" REF="69"> horns of a &s;nail, and are hid at
the ba&s;es of the &s;pines, &s;erving, as was &s;aid before, for procuring
food and motion. All this apparatus, however, is only &s;een when the animal is
hunting its prey at the bottom of the water; for a few minutes after it is
taken, all the horns are withdrawn into the body, and mo&s;t of the &s;pines
drop off.</P>
<P>It is generally &s;aid of in&s;ects, that tho&s;e which have the
greate&s;t number of legs, always move the &s;lowe&s;t: but this animal &s;eems
to be an ex|ception to the rule; for though furni&s;hed with two thou&s;and
&s;pines, and twelve hundred horns, all &s;erving for legs, and from their
number &s;eeming to impede each other's motion, yet it runs with &s;ome &s;hare
of &s;wiftne&s;s at the bottom, and it is &s;ometimes no ea&s;y matter to
overtake it. It is often taken upon the ebb, by following it in &s;hallow
water, either in an ozier ba&s;ket, or &s;imply with the hand. Both the
&s;pines and the horns a&s;&s;i&s;t its motion; and the animal is u&s;ually
&s;een running with the mouth down|ward.</P>
<P>Some kinds of this animal are as good eating as the lob&s;ter;
and its eggs, which are of a deep red, are con&s;idered as a very great
deli|cacy. But of others the ta&s;te is but indifferent; and in all places,
except the Mediterranean, they are little &s;ought for, except as objects of
curio&s;ity.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="70">Very different in motion, though not much
different in &s;hape from the&s;e, are the Acorn Shell-Fi&s;h, the Thumb-footed
Shell-Fi&s;h, and the Imaginary Barnacle. The&s;e are fixed to one &s;pot, and
appear to vegetate from a &s;talk. Indeed, to an inattentive &s;pectator, each
actually &s;eems to be a kind of fungus that grows in the deep, de&s;titute of
animal life as well as motion. But the enquirer will &s;oon change his opinion,
when he comes to ob&s;erve this mu&s;hroom-like figure more minutely. He will
then &s;ee that the animal re&s;iding within the &s;hell has not only life, but
&s;ome degree of voraciou&s;ne&s;s; that it has a cover, by which it opens and
&s;huts its &s;hell at plea&s;ure; that it has twelve long crooked arms,
furni&s;hed with hair, which it thru&s;ts forth for its prey; and eight
&s;maller, which are generally kept in the &s;hell. They are &s;een ad|hering
to every &s;ub&s;tance that is to be met with in the ocean; rocks, root of
trees, &s;hips bot|toms, whales, lob&s;ters, and even crabs; like bunches of
grapes, clung to each other. It is amu&s;ing enough to behold their
operations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ander&s;on's Hi&s;tory of
Greenland.</BIBL></NOTE>. They for &s;ome time remain motionle&s;s within their
&s;hell; but when the &s;ea is calm, they are &s;een opening the lid, and
peeping about them. They then thru&s;t out their long neck, look 
<PB N="65" REF="71"> round them for &s;ome time, and then abruptly retreat back
into their box, &s;hut their lid, and lurk in darkne&s;s and &s;ecurity. Some
people eat them; but they are in no great repute at the tables of the
luxurious, where their deformed figure would be no objection to their being
introduced.</P>
<P>Of all animals of the &s;helly tribe, the Pholades are the
mo&s;t wonderful. From their great powers of penetration, compared with their
apparent imbecility, they ju&s;tly excite the a&s;toni&s;hment of the curious
ob&s;erver. The&s;e animals are found in different places; &s;ometimes cloathed
in their proper &s;hell, at the bottom of the water; &s;ome|times concealed in
lumps of marly earth; and &s;ometimes lodged, &s;hell and all, in the body of
the harde&s;t marble. In their proper &s;hell they a&s;&s;ume different
figures; but, in general, they &s;omewhat re&s;emble a mu&s;cle, except that
their &s;hell is found actually compo&s;ed of five or more pieces, the
&s;maller valves &s;erving to clo&s;e up the openings left by the irregular
meeting of the two principal &s;hells. But their penetration into rocks, and
their re&s;idence there, makes up the mo&s;t wonderful part of their
hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>This animal, when dive&s;ted of its &s;hell, re|&s;embles a
roundi&s;h, &s;oft pudding, with no in|&s;trument that &s;eems in the lea&s;t
fitted for boring <PB N="66" REF="72"> into &s;tones, or even penetrating the
&s;ofte&s;t &s;ub|&s;tances. It is furni&s;hed with two teeth indeed; but
the&s;e are placed in &s;uch a &s;ituation as to be incapable of touching the
hollow &s;urface of its &s;tony dwelling: it has al&s;o two covers to its
&s;hell, that open and &s;hut at either end; but the&s;e are totally
un&s;erviceable to it as a miner. The in|&s;trument with which it performs all
its ope|rations, and buries it&s;elf in the harde&s;t rocks, is only a broad
fle&s;hy &s;ub&s;tance, &s;omewhat re|&s;embling a tongue, that is &s;een
i&s;&s;uing from the bottom of its &s;hell. With this &s;oft, yielding
in&s;trument, it perforates the mo&s;t &s;olid mar|bles; and having, while yet
little and young, made its way, by a very narrow entrance, into the
&s;ub&s;tance of the &s;tone, it then begins to grow bigger, and thus to
enlarge its apartment.</P>
<P>The &s;eeming unfitne&s;s, however, of this ani|mal for
penetrating into rocks, and there form|ing an habitation, has induced many
philo|&s;ophers to &s;uppo&s;e that they entered the rock while it was yet in
&s;oft &s;tate, and from the petrifying quality of the water, that the whole
rock afterwards hardened round them by de|grees. Thus any penetrating quality,
it was thought, was unju&s;tly a&s;cribed to them, as they only bored into a
&s;oft &s;ub&s;tance, that was har|dened by time. This opinion, however, has
been <PB N="67" REF="73"> confuted, in a very &s;atisfactory manner, by Doctor
Bohads, who ob&s;erved, that many of the pillars of the temple of Serapis at
Puteoli were penetrated by the&s;e animals. From thence he very ju&s;tly
concludes, that the pholas mu&s;t have pierced into them &s;ince they were
erected; for no workmen would have laboured a pillar into form; if it had been
honey-combed by worms in the quarry. In &s;hort, there can be no doubt but that
the pillars were perfectly &s;ound when erected; and that the pholades have
attacked them, during that time in which they continued buried under water, by
means of the earthquake that &s;wallowed up the city<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Bohad&s;ch de Animalibus Marinis, p. 153.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>From hence it appears that, in all nature, there is not a
greater in&s;tance of per&s;everance and patience than what this animal is
&s;een to exhibit. Furni&s;hed with the blunte&s;t and &s;ofte&s;t augre, by
&s;low, &s;ucce&s;&s;ive applications, it effects what other animals are
incapable of performing by force; penetrating the harde&s;t bodies only with
its tongue. When, while yet naked and very &s;mall, it has effected an
entrance, and has buried its body in the &s;tone, it there continues for life
at its ea&s;e; the &s;ea water that enters at the little aperture &s;upplying
it with luxurious plenty. When the animal has taken too great a quan|tity 
<PB N="68" REF="74"> of water, it is &s;een to &s;purt it out of its hole with
&s;ome violence. Upon this &s;eemingly thin diet, it quickly grows larger, and
&s;oon finds it&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity of enlarging its habitation and its
&s;hell. The motion of the pholas is &s;low beyond conception; its progre&s;s
keeps pace with the growth of its body; and, in proportion as it becomes
larger, it makes its way farther into the rock. When it has got a certain way
in, it then turns from its former direction, and hollows downward; till, at
la&s;t, when its habitation is completed, the whole apartment re&s;embles the
bole of a tobacco pipe; the hole in the &s;hank being that by which the animal
entered.</P>
<P>Thus immured, the pholas lives in darkne&s;s, indolence, and
plenty; it never removes from the narrow man&s;ion into which it has
penetrated; and &s;eems perfectly content with being inclo&s;ed in its own
&s;epulchre. The influx of the &s;ea-water, that enters by its little gallery,
&s;atisfies all its wants; and, without any other food, it is found to grow
from &s;even to eight inches long, and thick in proportion.</P>
<P>But they are not &s;upplied only with their rocky habitation;
they have al&s;o a &s;hell to pro|tect them: this &s;hell grows upon them in
the body of the rock, and &s;eems a very unnece&s;&s;ary addition to their
defence, which they have pro|cured <PB N="69" REF="75"> them&s;elves by art.
The&s;e &s;hells take dif|ferent forms, and are often compo&s;ed of a different
number of valves; &s;ometimes &s;ix; &s;ometimes but three; &s;ometimes the
&s;hell re|&s;embles a tube with holes at either end, one for the mouth, and
the other for voiding the ex|crements.</P>
<P>Yet the pholas thus &s;hut up, is not &s;o &s;olitary an animal
as it would at fir&s;t appear; for though it is immured in its hole without
egre&s;s, though it is impo&s;&s;ible for the animal, grown to a great &s;ize,
to get out by the way it made in, yet many of this kind often meet in the heart
of the rock, and, like miners in a &s;iege, who &s;ometimes cro&s;s each
other's galleries, they frequently break in upon each other's retreats. Whether
their thus meeting be the work of accident or of choice, few can take upon them
to determine; certain it is, they are mo&s;t commonly found in numbers in the
&s;ame rock; and &s;ometimes above twenty are di&s;covered within a few inches
of each other.</P>
<P>As to the re&s;t, this animal is found in greate&s;t numbers at
Ancona, in Italy; it is found along the &s;hores of Normandy and Poitou, in
France; it is found al&s;o upon &s;ome of the coa&s;ts of Scot|land: and, in
general, is con&s;idered as a very great delicacy, at the tables of the
luxurious.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of Frogs and Toads in General.</HEAD>
<P>IF we emerge from the deep, the fir&s;t and mo&s;t obvious
cla&s;s of amphibious animals that occur upon land are frogs and toads.
The&s;e, wherever they re&s;ide, &s;eem equally adapted for living upon land
and in the water, having their hearts formed in &s;uch a manner as to
di&s;pen&s;e with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the lungs in carrying on the
circulation. The frog and the toad there|fore can live &s;everal days under
water, without any danger of &s;uffocation; they want but little air at the
bottom; and, what is wanting, is &s;up|plied by lungs, like bladders, which are
generally di&s;tended with wind, and an&s;wer all the purpo&s;es of a
re&s;ervoir from whence to breathe.</P>
<P>To de&s;cribe the form of animals &s;o well known would be
&s;uperfluous; to mark tho&s;e differences that di&s;tingui&s;h them from each
other may be nece&s;&s;ary. The frog moves by leaping; the toad crawls along
the ground: the frog is in general le&s;s than the toad; its colour is
brighter, and with a more poli&s;hed &s;urface: the toad is brown, rough and
du&s;ty. The frog is light and active, and its belly com|paratively 
<PB N="74" REF="78"> &s;mall; the toad is &s;low, &s;wolen, and incapable of
e&s;caping. The frog, when taken, contracts it&s;elf &s;o as to have a lump on
its back; the toad's back is &s;traight and even. Their in|ternal parts are
nearly the &s;ame, except that the lungs of the toad are more compact than
tho&s;e of the frog; they have fewer air-bladders, and of con&s;equence the
animal is le&s;s fitted for living under water. Such are the differences with
re&s;pect to figure and conformation; their habi|tudes and manners exhibit a
greater variety, and require a &s;eparate de&s;cription.</P>

<PB N="75" REF="79">
<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the Frog and its Varieties.</HEAD>
<P>THE external figure of the Frog is too well known to need a
de&s;cription. Its power of taking large leaps is remarkably great, com|pared
to the bulk of its body. It is the be&s;t &s;wimmer of all four-footed animals;
and Nature hath finely adapted its parts for tho&s;e ends, the arms being light
and active, the legs and thighs long, and furni&s;hed with very &s;trong
mu&s;cles.</P>
<P>If we examine this animal internally, we &s;hall find that it
has a very little brain for its &s;ize; a very wide &s;wallow; a &s;tomach
&s;eemingly &s;mall, but capable of great di&s;ten&s;ion. The heart in the
frog, as in all other animals that are truly amphibious, has but one ventricle;
&s;o that the blood can circulate without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the lungs,
while it keeps under water. The lungs re&s;emble a number of &s;mall bladders
joined together, like the cells of a honey|comb: they are connected to the back
by mu&s;cles, and can be di&s;tended or exhau&s;ted at the animal's plea&s;ure.
The male has two te&s;ticuli lying near the kidnies; and the female has two
ovaries, lying near the &s;ame place: but <PB N="76" REF="80"> neither male nor
female have any of the external in&s;truments of generation; the anus &s;erving
for that purpo&s;e in both. Such are the mo&s;t &s;triking peculiarities in the
anatomy of a frog; and in the&s;e it agrees with the toad, the lizard, and the
&s;erpent. They are all formed internally pretty much in the &s;ame manner,
with &s;pongy lungs, a &s;imple heart, and are de&s;titute of the ex|ternal
in&s;truments that &s;erve to continue the kind.</P>
<P>Of all tho&s;e who have given hi&s;tories of the frog, Mr.
Rae&s;el, of Nuremberg, &s;eems the mo&s;t accurate and entertaining. His
plates of this animal are well known; his a&s;&s;iduity and &s;kil|fulne&s;s in
ob&s;erving its manners are &s;till more de&s;erving our e&s;teem. In&s;tead,
therefore, of following any other, I will take him for my guide; and though it
be out of my power to amu&s;e the reader with his beautiful de&s;igns, yet
there will be &s;ome merit in tran&s;cribing his hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The Common Brown Frog begins to couple early in the &s;ea&s;on,
and as &s;oon as the ice is thawed from the &s;tagnating waters. In &s;ome
places the cold protracts the irgenial appetite till April; but it generally
begins about the middle of March. The male is u&s;ually of a greyi&s;h brown
colour; the female is more inclining to yellow, &s;peckled with brown. When
they <PB N="77" REF="81"> couple, the colours of both are nearly alike on the
back; but as they change their &s;kins almo&s;t every eighth day, the old one
falling off in the form of a mucous, the male grows yellower, and the female
more brown. In the males the arms and legs are much &s;tronger than in the
females; and, at the time of coupling, they have, upon their thumbs, a kind of
fle&s;hy excre&s;cence, which they fix firmly to the brea&s;t of the female.
This Linnaeus &s;uppo&s;ed to be the male in&s;trument of generation; but, by
clo&s;er in&s;pection, it is found only of &s;ervice in holding the female in a
more &s;trict embrace. It may be cut off, and the impregnation con|tinue
unimpaired: it is &s;ometimes found in the oppo&s;ite &s;ex; and &s;ome of the
males are found entirely without it: however, when it is cut off, the male
cannot hold the female &s;o &s;trongly as before.</P>
<P>The &s;ex couple only once a year; and then continue united
&s;ometimes for four days to|gether. At this time they both have their bellies
greatly &s;wolen; that of the female being filled with eggs: the male having
the &s;kin of the whole body di&s;tended with a limpid water, which is ejected
in impregnation. As &s;oon as the male has leaped upon the female, he throws
his fore legs round her brea&s;t, and clo&s;es them &s;o firmly that it is
impo&s;&s;ible with the naked <PB N="78" REF="82"> hands to loo&s;e them. The
male cla&s;ps his fingers between each other, in the &s;ame manner as people
when they are praying; the thumbs pre&s;s with their thicke&s;t &s;ides
again&s;t the brea&s;t of the female; and though &s;he &s;hould &s;truggle ever
&s;o much, nothing can induce him to let go his hold. The gra&s;p &s;eems
involuntary and convul&s;ive; they cannot be ea&s;ily torn a&s;under; and they
&s;wim, creep, and live united for &s;ome days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, till the
female has &s;hed her &s;pawn, which at length &s;he does almo&s;t in an
in&s;tant. But how the impregnation is performed, without any apparent
in&s;truments of generation, has long been an object of enquiry; and &s;till
continues in great ob&s;curity. To inve|&s;tigate the difficulty as carefully
as po&s;&s;ible, our German philo&s;opher continued to examine their mutual
congre&s;s for three years together, and availed him&s;elf of all the lights
that the knife, or analogy, could furni&s;h.</P>
<P>After having cho&s;en twelve couple of frogs that were thus
joined to each other, and having placed each couple in a gla&s;s ve&s;&s;el
with water, he &s;carce let them out of his &s;ight day or night, and even
&s;ate up two nights together to examine their operations. The fir&s;t day he
ob&s;erved no|thing that de&s;erved remark; but the &s;econd they began to be
agitated more than before; the males made a noi&s;e &s;omewhat re&s;embling the
<PB N="79" REF="83"> grunting of a hog; the females only kept &s;inking and
ri&s;ing in the water.</P>
<P>The male of the fir&s;t couple ejected the hu|midity with which
his body was &s;wolen, by which the water in the gla&s;s was made muddy; and he
&s;oon after quitted the female. Our philo&s;opher continued for twelve hours
to ob&s;erve whether the female would ca&s;t her &s;pawn; but finding her
tardy, he di&s;&s;ected both her and the male: in the latter, the &s;permatic
ve&s;&s;els were quite empty, as might naturally have been &s;uppo&s;ed; but
for the female, her &s;pawn &s;till remained in her body. Upon its being
extracted, and put into water, it peri&s;hed without producing any animal
whatever. From hence he ju&s;tly concluded, that it required that the eggs
&s;hould be ejected from the body of the female before they could be at all
prolific. In another pair the male quitted the female, who did not eject her
&s;pawn till &s;ixteen days after; and the&s;e, like the former, came to
nothing. But it was very different with &s;ome of the re&s;t. The females
ejected their &s;pawn, while the male &s;till remained in his &s;tation, and
impregnated the ma&s;&s;es at different intervals as they fell from her; and
the&s;e all brought forth animals in the u&s;ual cour&s;e of generation. From
the&s;e ob&s;ervations it was ea&s;y to infer, that the female was impreg|nated
<PB N="80" REF="84"> neither by the mouth, as &s;ome philo|&s;ophers imagined,
nor by the excre&s;cence at the thumbs, as was the opinion of Linnaeus, but by
the in&s;per&s;ion of the male &s;eminal fluid upon the eggs as they proceeded
from the body.</P>
<P>A &s;ingle female produces from &s;ix to eleven hundred eggs at
a time; and, in general, &s;he throws them all out together by a &s;ingle
effort; though &s;ometimes &s;he is an hour in performing this ta&s;k. While
&s;he is thus bringing forth, it may be ob&s;erved, that the male acts the part
of a midwife, and promotes the expul&s;ion of the eggs by working with his
thumbs, and compre&s;&s;ing the female's body more clo&s;ely. The eggs which
were compre&s;&s;ed in the womb, upon being emitted, expand them&s;elves into a
round form, and drop to the bottom of the water, while the male &s;wims off,
and &s;trikes with his arms as u&s;ual, though they had continued &s;o long in
a &s;tate of violent contraction.</P>
<P>The egg, or little black globe, which pro|duces a tadpole, is
&s;urrounded with two different kinds of liquor. That which immediately
&s;ur|rounds the globe is clear and tran&s;parent, and contained in its proper
membrane; that which &s;urrounds the whole is muddy and mucous. The
tran&s;parent liquor &s;erves for the nouri&s;hment of the tadpole from time to
time; and an&s;wers <PB N="81" REF="85"> the &s;ame purpo&s;es that the white
of the egg does to birds. The tadpoles, when this mem|brane is broken, are
found to adhere with their mouth to part of it; and when they get free, they
immediately &s;ink to the bottom of the water, never being able to get to the
top after while they continue in their tadpole form.</P>
<P>But to return&mdash;When the &s;pawn is emitted and impregnated
by the male, it drops, as was &s;aid, to the bottom, and there the white
quickly and &s;en&s;ibly encrea&s;es. The eggs, which during the four fir&s;t
hours &s;uffer no perceptible change, begin then to enlarge and grow lighter;
by which means they mount to the &s;urface of the water. At the end of eight
hours, the white in which they &s;wim grows thicker, the eggs lo&s;e their
Blackne&s;s, and as they encrea&s;e in &s;ize, &s;ome|what of their &s;pherical
form. The twenty-fir&s;t day the egg is &s;een to open a little on one &s;ide,
and the beginning of a tail to peep out, which becomes more and more di&s;tinct
every day. The thirty-ninth day the little animal begins to have motion; it
moves at intervals its tail; and it is perceived that the liquor in which it is
circumfu&s;ed, &s;erves it for nouri&s;h|ment. In two days more, &s;ome of
the&s;e little creatures fall to the bottom; while others remain &s;wimming in
the fluid around them, <PB N="82" REF="86"> while their vivacity and motion is
&s;een to en|crea&s;e. Tho&s;e which fall to the bottom re|main there the whole
day; but having length|ened them&s;elves a little, for hitherto they are
doubled up, they mount at intervals to the mucous which they had quitted, and
are &s;een to feed upon it with great vivacity. The next day they acquire their
tadpole form. In three days more they are perceived to have two little fringes,
that &s;erve as fins beneath the the head; and the&s;e in four days after
a&s;&s;ume a more perfect form. It is then al&s;o that they are &s;een to feed
very greedily upon the pond|weed with which they are to be &s;upplied; and,
leaving their former food, on this they continue to &s;ub&s;i&s;t till they
arrive at maturity. When they come to be ninety-two days old, two &s;mall feet
are &s;een beginning to burgeon near the tail; and the head appears to be
&s;eparate from the body. The next day, the legs are con|&s;iderably enlarged;
four days after they refu&s;e all vegetable food; their mouth appears
fur|ni&s;hed with teeth; and their hinder legs are completely formed. In two
days more the arms are completely produced; and now the frog is every way
perfect, except that it &s;till continues to carry the tail. In this odd
&s;ituation the animal, re&s;embling at once both a frog <PB N="83" REF="87">
and a lizard, is &s;een frequently ri&s;ing to the &s;urface, not to take food
but to breathe. In this &s;tate it continues for about &s;ix or eight hours;
and then the tail dropping off by de|grees, the animal appears in its mo&s;t
perfect form.</P>
<P>Thus the frog, in le&s;s than a day, having changed its figure,
is &s;een to change its appe|tites al&s;o. So extraordinary is this
transformation, that the food it fed upon &s;o greedily but a few days before,
is now utterly rejected; it would even &s;tarve if &s;upplied with no other. As
&s;oon as the animal acquires its perfect &s;tate, from having fed upon
vegetables it becomes carni|vorous, and lives entirely upon worms and
in|&s;ects. But as the water cannot &s;upply the&s;e, it is obliged to quit its
native element, and &s;eek for food upon land, where it lives by hunt|ing worms
and taking in&s;ects by &s;urprize. At fir&s;t, being feeble and unable to bear
the warmth of the &s;un, it hides among bu&s;hes and under &s;tones; but when a
&s;hower comes to re|fre&s;h the earth, then the whole multitude are &s;een to
quit their retreats, in order to enjoy the grateful humidity. Upon many
occa&s;ions the ground is &s;een perfectly blackened with their numbers; &s;ome
hunting for prey, and &s;ome &s;eeking &s;ecure lurking places. From the
myriads <PB N="84" REF="88"> that offer on &s;uch occa&s;ions, &s;ome have been
induced to think that the&s;e animals were gene|rated in the clouds, and thus
&s;howered down on the earth. But had they, like Derham, traced them to the
next pool, they would have found out a better &s;olution for the
difficulty.</P>
<P>The frog lives for the mo&s;t part out of the water; but when
the cold nights begin to &s;et in, it returns to its native element, always
chu&s;ing &s;tagnant waters, where it can lie without danger concealed at the
bottom. In this manner it continues torpid, or with but very little motion, all
the winter: like the re&s;t of the dormant race, it requires no food; and the
circulation is &s;lowly carried on without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the
air.</P>
<P>It is at the approach of &s;pring that all the&s;e animals are
rouzed from a &s;tate of &s;lumber to a &s;tate of enjoyment. A &s;hort time
after they ri&s;e from the bottom they begin to pair, while tho&s;e that are as
yet too young come upon land before the re&s;t. For this rea&s;on, while the
old ones continue concealed in the beginning of &s;pring, the &s;mall ones are
more frequently &s;een; the former remaining in the lake to propagate, while
the latter are not yet arrived at a &s;tate of maturity.</P>
<P>The difference of &s;exes, which was mentioned above, is not
perceivable in the&s;e animals, until <PB N="85" REF="89"> they have arrived at
their fourth year; nor do they begin to propagate, till they have com|pleted
that period. By comparing their &s;low growth with their other habitudes, it
would ap|pear, that they live about twelve years; but having &s;o many enemies,
both by land and water, it is probable that few of them arrive at the end of
their term.</P>
<P>Frogs live upon in&s;ects of all kinds; but they never eat any,
unle&s;s they have motion. They continue fixed and immovable till their prey
ap|pears; and ju&s;t when it comes &s;ufficiently near, they jump forward with
great agility, dart out their tongues, and &s;eize it with certainty. The
tongue, in this animal, as in the toad, lizard and &s;erpent kinds, is
extremely long, and formed in &s;uch a manner that it &s;wallows the point down
its throat; &s;o that a length of tongue is thus drawn out, like a &s;word from
its &s;cabbard, to a&s;&s;ail its prey. This tongue is furni&s;hed with a
glutinous &s;ub&s;tance; and whatever in&s;ect it touches, infallibly adheres,
and is thus held fa&s;t till it is drawn into the mouth.</P>
<P>As the frog is thus &s;upplied with the power of catching its
prey, it is al&s;o very vivacious, and able to bear hunger for a very long
time. I have known one of them continue a month in &s;ummer without any other
food than the turf <PB N="86" REF="90"> on which it was placed in a gla&s;s
ve&s;&s;el. We are told of a German &s;urgeon, that kept one eight years in a
gla&s;s ve&s;&s;el, covered with a net. Its food was at all times but
&s;paring; in &s;ummer he gave it fre&s;h gra&s;s, which it is &s;aid to have
fed upon; and, in the winter, hay, a little moi&s;tened: he likewi&s;e now and
then put flies into the gla&s;s, which it would follow with an open mouth, and
was very expert in catching them. In winter, when the flies were difficult to
be found, it u&s;ually fell away, and grew very lean; but, in the &s;ummer,
when they were plenty, it &s;oon grew fat again. It was kept in a warm room,
and was always lively and ready to take its prey; however, in the eighth
winter, when there were no flies to be found, it fell away and died. It is not
certain how long it might have lived, had it been &s;upplied with proper
nouri&s;hment; but we are certain, that a very little food is capable of
&s;ufficing its nece&s;&s;ities.</P>
<P>Nor is the frog le&s;s tenacious of life. It will live and jump
about &s;everal hours after its head has been cut off. It will continue active,
though all its bowels are taken out; and it can live &s;ome days, though
entirely &s;tripped of its &s;kin. This cruel trick, which is chiefly
practi&s;ed among &s;chool-boys, of &s;kinning frogs, an operation which is
done in an in&s;tant, &s;eems for &s;ome hours <PB N="87" REF="91"> no way to
abate their vigour. I am a&s;&s;ured that &s;ome of them get a new &s;kin, and
recover after this painful experiment.</P>
<P>The croaking of frogs is well known; and from thence, in &s;ome
countries, they are di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the ludicrous title of Dutch
Night|ingales. Indeed, the aquatic frogs of Holland are loud beyond what one
would imagine. We could hardly conceive that an animal, not bigger than one's
fi&s;t, &s;hould be able to &s;end forth a note that is heard at three miles
di&s;tance; yet &s;uch is actually the ca&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Rae&s;el, ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>. The large water frogs have a
note as loud as the bellowing of a bull; and, for this purpo&s;e, puff up their
cheeks to a &s;ur|prizing magnitude. Of all frogs, however, the male only
croaks; the female is &s;ilent, and the voice in the other &s;eems to be the
call to court|&s;hip. It is certain, that at the&s;e times when they couple,
the loudne&s;s of their croaking is in &s;ome places very trouble&s;ome; for
then the whole lake &s;eems vocal; and a thou&s;and di&s;&s;onant notes
per|fectly &s;tun the neighbourhood. At other times al&s;o, before wet weather,
their voices are in full exertion; they are then heard with uncea&s;ing
a&s;&s;iduity, &s;ending forth their call, and welcoming the approaches of
their favourite moi&s;ture. No weather-gla&s;s was ever &s;o true as a frog in
fore|telling <PB N="88" REF="92"> an approaching change; and, in fact, the
German &s;urgeon, mentioned above, kept his frog for that purpo&s;e. It was
always heard to croak at the approach of wet weather; but was as mute as a
fi&s;h, when it threatened a con|tinuance of fair. This may probably &s;erve to
explain an opinion which &s;ome entertain, that there is a month in the year,
called Paddock Moon, in which the frogs never croak: the whole &s;eems to be no
more than that, in the hot &s;ea&s;on, when the moi&s;ture is dried away, and
con&s;equently when the&s;e animals neither enjoy the quantity of health or
food that at other times they are &s;upplied with, they &s;hew, by their
&s;ilence, how much they are di&s;plea&s;ed with the weather. All very dry
weather is hurt|ful to their health, and prevents them from getting their prey.
They &s;ub&s;i&s;t chiefly upon worms and &s;nails; and as drought prevents
the&s;e from appearing, the frog is thus &s;tinted in its provi&s;ions, and
al&s;o wants that grateful humidity which moi&s;tens its &s;kin, and renders it
alert and active.</P>
<P>As frogs adhere clo&s;ely to the backs of their own &s;pecies,
&s;o it has been found, by repeated experience, they will al&s;o adhere to the
backs of fi&s;hes. Few that have ponds, but know that the&s;e animals will
&s;tick to the backs of carp, and fix their fingers in the corner of each eye.
In <PB N="89" REF="93"> this manner they are often caught together; the carp
blinded and wa&s;ted away. Whether this proceeds from the de&s;ires of the
frog, di&s;|appointed of its proper mate, or whether it be a natural enmity
between frogs and fi&s;hes, I will not take upon me to &s;ay. A &s;tory told us
by Walton, might be apt to incline us to the latter opinion.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"As Dubravius, a bi&s;hop of Bohemia, was
walking with a friend by a large pond in that country, they &s;aw a frog, when
the pike lay very &s;leepily and quiet by the &s;hore &s;ide, leap upon his
head, and the frog having expre&s;&s;ed malice or anger by his &s;wolen cheeks
and &s;taring eyes, did &s;tretch out his legs, and embraced the pike's head,
and pre&s;ently reached them to his eyes, tearing with them and his teeth
tho&s;e tender parts; the pike, irritated with angui&s;h, moves up and down the
water, and rubs him&s;elf again&s;t weeds, and whatever he thought might quit
him of his enemy; but all in vain, for the frog did continue to ride
triumphantly, and to bite and torment the pike till his &s;trength failed, and
then the frog &s;unk with the pike to the bottom of the water: then pre&s;ently
the frog appeared again at the top and croaked, and &s;eemed to rejoice like a
conqueror; after <PB N="90" REF="94"> which he pre&s;ently retired to his
&s;ecret hole. The bi&s;hop that had beheld the battle, called his fi&s;herman
to fetch his nets, and by all means to get the pike, that they might de|clare
what had happened. The pike was drawn forth, and both his eyes eaten out; at
which, when they began to wonder, the fi&s;h|erman wi&s;hed them to forbear,
and a&s;&s;ured them he was certain that pikes were often &s;o
&s;erved."</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of the Toad and its Varieties.</HEAD>
<P>IF we regard the figure of the Toad, there &s;eems nothing in it
that &s;hould di&s;gu&s;t more than that of the frog. Its form and proportions
are nearly the &s;ame; and it chiefly differs in colour, which is blacker; and
its &s;low and heavy motion, which exhibits nothing of the agility of the frog:
yet &s;uch is the force of habit, be|gun in early prejudice, that tho&s;e who
con&s;ider the one as an harmle&s;s, playful animal, turn from the other with
horror and di&s;gu&s;t. The frog is con&s;idered as a u&s;eful a&s;&s;i&s;tant,
in ridding our grounds of vermin; the toad, as a &s;ecret enemy, that only
wants an opportunity to infect us with its venom.</P>
<P>The imagination, in this manner bia&s;&s;ed by its terrors,
paints out the toad in the mo&s;t hi|deous colouring, and cloaths it in more
than natural deformity. Its body is broad; its back flat; covered with a
du&s;ky, pimpled hide; the belly is large and &s;wagging; the pace laboured and
crawling; its retreat gloomy and filthy; and its whole appearance calculated to
excite di&s;gu&s;t and horror: yet upon my fir&s;t &s;eeing a 
<PB N="92" REF="96"> toad, none of all the&s;e deformities in the lea&s;t
affected me with &s;en&s;ations of loathing: born, as I was, in a country where
there are no toads, I had prepared my imagination for &s;ome dread|ful object;
but there &s;eemed nothing to me more alarming in the &s;ight, than in that of
a com|mon frog; and indeed, for &s;ome time, I mi&s;took and handled the one
for the other. When fir&s;t informed of my mi&s;take, I very well remember my
&s;en&s;ations: I wondered how I had e&s;caped with &s;afety, after handling
and di&s;&s;ecting a toad, which I had mi&s;taken for a frog. I then began to
lay in a fund of horror again&s;t the whole tribe, which, though convinced they
are harm|le&s;s, I &s;hall never get rid of. My fir&s;t imagi|nations were too
&s;trong not only for my rea&s;on, but for the conviction of my &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>As the toad bears a general re&s;emblance of figure to the frog,
&s;o al&s;o it re&s;embles that ani|mal in its nature and appetites. Like the
frog, the toad is amphibious; like that animal, it lives upon worms and
in&s;ects, which it &s;eizes by dart|ing out its length of tongue; and in the
&s;ame manner al&s;o it crawls about in moi&s;t weather. The male and female
couple as in all the frog kind; their time of propagation being very early in
the &s;pring. Sometimes the females are &s;een upon land, oppre&s;&s;ed by the
males; but <PB N="93" REF="97"> more frequently they are coupled in the water.
They continue together &s;ome hours, and adhere &s;o fa&s;t as to tear the very
&s;kin from the parts they &s;tick to. In all this they entirely re&s;emble the
frog; but the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance which the male lends the female, in bringing
forth, is a peculiarity in this &s;pecies that mu&s;t not be pa&s;&s;ed over in
&s;ilence. 
<Q REND="inline">"In the evening of a &s;ummer's day, a French
gentleman, being in the king's gardens at Paris, perceived two toads coupled
together, and he &s;topped to examine them. Two facts equally new &s;urprized
him: the fir&s;t was the extreme difficulty the female had in laying her eggs;
the &s;econd was the a&s;&s;i&s;tance lent her by the male for this purpo&s;e.
The eggs of the female lie in her body, like beads on a &s;tring; and after the
fir&s;t, by great effort, was excluded, the male caught it with his hinder
paws, and kept working it till he had thus extracted the whole chain. In this
man|ner the animal performed, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the functions of a midwife;
impregnating, at the &s;ame time, every egg as it i&s;&s;ued from the
body."</Q></P>
<P>It is probable, however, that this difficulty in bringing forth,
obtains only upon land; and that the toad, which produces its &s;pawn in the 
<PB N="94" REF="98"> water, performs it with as much ea&s;e as a frog. They
propagate in England, exactly in the manner of frogs; and the female, in&s;tead
of retiring to dry holes, goes to the bottom of ponds, and there lies torpid
all the winter, preparing to propagate in the beginning of &s;pring. On the&s;e
occa&s;ions, the number of males is found greatly to &s;urpa&s;s that of the
other &s;ex, there being above thirty to one; and twelve or fourteen are often
&s;een clinging to the &s;ame female.</P>
<P>When, like the frog, they have undergone all the variations of
their tadpole &s;tate, they for&s;ake the water; and are often &s;een, in a
moi&s;t &s;ummer's evening, crawling up, by myriads, from fenny places, into
drier &s;itu|ations. There, having found out a retreat, or having dug
them&s;elves one with their mouth and hands, they lead a patient, &s;olitary
life, &s;eldom venturing out, except when the moi&s;ture of a &s;ummer's
evening invites them abroad. At that time the gra&s;s is filled with &s;nails,
and the pathways covered with worms, which make their principal food. In&s;ects
al&s;o of every kind they are fond of; and we have the authority of Linnaeus
for it, that they &s;ometimes continue immovable, with the mouth open, at the
bot|tom of &s;hrubs, where the butterflies, in &s;ome <PB N="95" REF="99">
mea&s;ure fa&s;cinated, are &s;een to fly down their throats<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Amaenit, vol. vi. p. 201.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>In a letter from Mr. Ar&s;cott, there are &s;ome curious
particulars relating to this animal, which throws great light upon its
hi&s;tory. 
<Q REND="inline">"Con|cerning the toad," &s;ays he, "that lived
&s;o many years with us, and was &s;o great a fa|vourite, the greate&s;t
curio&s;ity was its be|coming &s;o remarkably tame: it had fre|quented &s;ome
&s;teps before our hall door &s;ome years before my acquaintance commenced with
it, and had been admired by my father for its &s;ize (being the large&s;t I
ever met with) who con&s;tantly paid it a vi&s;it every evening. I knew it
my&s;elf above thirty years; and by con&s;tantly feeding it, brought it to be
&s;o tame, that it always came to the candle and looked up, as if expecting to
be taken up and brought upon the table, where I always fed it with in|&s;ects
of all &s;orts. It was fonde&s;t of fle&s;h mag|gots, which I kept in bran; it
would follow them, and when within a proper di&s;tance, would fix his eyes and
remain motionle&s;s for near a quarter of a minute, as if preparing for the
&s;troke, which was an in&s;tantaneous throwing its tongue at a great
di&s;tance upon <PB N="96" REF="100"> the in&s;ect, which &s;tuck to the tip by
a glutinous matter. The motion is quicker than the eye can follow. I cannot
&s;ay how long my father had been acquainted with the toad, before I knew it;
but when I was fir&s;t acquainted with it, he u&s;ed to mention it as the old
toad I have known &s;o many years. I can an&s;wer for thirty-&s;ix years. This
old toad made its appearance as &s;oon as the warm weather came; and I al|ways
concluded it retired to &s;ome dry bank, to repo&s;e till &s;pring. When we new
layed the &s;teps, I had two holes made in the third &s;tep, on each with a
hollow of more than a yard long for it; in which I imagine it &s;lept, as it
came from thence at its fir&s;t appearance. It was &s;eldom provoked. Neither
that toad, nor the multitudes I have &s;een tormented with great cruelty, ever
&s;hewed the lea&s;t de|&s;ire of revenge, by &s;pitting or emitting any juice
from their pimples. Sometimes, upon taking it up, it would let out a great
quantity of clear water, which, as I have often &s;een it do the &s;ame upon
the &s;teps when quite quiet, was certainly its urine, and no more than a
natural evacuation. Spiders, millepedes, and fle&s;h maggots, &s;eem to be this
animal's favourite food. I imagine if a bee was to be put before a toad, it
would certainly eat it <PB N="97" REF="101"> to its co&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rae&s;el tried a frog; it &s;wallowed the bee alive: its &s;tomach
was &s;tung, and the animal vomited it up again.</NOTE>; but as bees are
&s;eldom &s;tir|ring at the &s;ame time that toads are, they rarely come in
their way; as they do not ap|pear after &s;un-ri&s;ing, or before &s;un-&s;et.
In the heat of the day they will come to the mouth of their hole, I believe for
air. I once, from my parlour window, ob&s;erved a large toad I had in the bank
of a bowling-green, about twelve at noon, a very hot day, very bu&s;y and
active upon the gra&s;s. So un|common an appearance made me go out to &s;ee
what it was; when I found an innu|merable &s;warm of winged ants had dropped
round his hole; which temptation was as ir|re&s;i&s;tible as a turtle would be
to a luxurious alderman. In re&s;pect to its end, had it not been for a tame
raven, I make no doubt but it would have been now living. This bird, one day
&s;eeing it at the mouth of its hole, pulled it out, and, although I re&s;cued
it, pulled out one eye, and hurt it &s;o, that not|with&s;tanding its living a
twelve-month, it never enjoyed it&s;elf, and had a difficulty of taking its
food, mi&s;&s;ing the mark for want of its eye. Before that accident, it had
all the appearance of perfect health."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="102">To this account of the toad's inoffen&s;ive
qualities, I will add another from Vali&s;nieri, to &s;hew that, even taken
internally, the toad is no way dangerous. 
<Q REND="inline">"In the year 1692, &s;ome German &s;oldiers, who
had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ca&s;tle of Arceti, finding that the
pea&s;ants of the country often amu&s;ed them&s;elves in catching frogs, and
dre&s;&s;ing them for the table; re&s;olved to provide them&s;elves with a like
entertainment, and made preparations for frog fi&s;hing, in the &s;ame manner.
It may ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed that the Italians and their German gue&s;ts
were not very fond of each other; and indeed it is natural to think that the
&s;oldiers gave the poor people of the country many good rea&s;ons for
di&s;content. They were not a little plea&s;ed, therefore, when they &s;aw them
go to a ditch where toads in&s;tead of frogs were found in abundance. The
Germans, no way di&s;tingui&s;hing, in their &s;port caught them in great
numbers; while the pea&s;ants kept looking on, &s;ilently flat|tering
them&s;elves with the hopes of &s;peedy revenge. After being brought home, the
toads were dre&s;&s;ed up, after the Italian fa&s;hion; the pea&s;ants quite
happy at &s;eeing their tyrants devour them with &s;o good an appetite, and
expecting every moment to &s;ee <PB N="99" REF="103"> them drop down dead: But
what was their &s;urprize to find, that the Germans continued as well as ever,
and only complained of a &s;light excoriation of the lips, which probably
aro&s;e from &s;ome other cau&s;e than that of their repa&s;t."</Q></P>
<P>I will add another &s;tory, from Solenander; who tells us, that
a trade&s;man of Rome and his wife had long lived together with mutual
di&s;|content; the man was drop&s;ical, and the woman amorous: this ill-matched
&s;ociety promi&s;ed &s;oon, by the very infirm &s;tate of the man, to have an
end; but the woman was unwilling to wait the progre&s;s of the di&s;order; and
therefore con|cluded that, to get rid of her hu&s;band, nothing was left her
but poi&s;on. For this purpo&s;e, &s;he cho&s;e out a do&s;e that &s;he
&s;uppo&s;ed would be the mo&s;t effectual; and having calcined &s;ome toads,
mixed their powder with his drink. The man, after taking a hearty do&s;e, found
no con&s;iderable inconvenience, except that it greatly promoted urine. His
wife, who con|&s;idered this as a beginning &s;ymptom of the venom, re&s;olved
not to &s;tint the next do&s;e, but gave it in greater quantites than before.
This al&s;o encrea&s;ed the former &s;ymptom; and, in a few days, the woman had
the mortification to &s;ee her dete&s;ted hu&s;band re&s;tored to perfect 
<PB N="100" REF="104"> health; and remained in utter de&s;pair of ever being a
widow.</P>
<P>From all this it will appear with what in|ju&s;tice this animal
has hitherto been treated. It has undergone every reproach; and mankind have
been taught to con&s;ider as an enemy, a creature that de&s;troys that infect
tribe which are their real invaders. We are to treat, therefore, as fables,
tho&s;e accounts that repre&s;ent the toad as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of poi&s;on to
kill at a di&s;tance; of its ejecting its venom, which burns wherever it
touches; of its infecting tho&s;e vegetables near which it re&s;ides; of its
exce&s;&s;ive fondne&s;s for &s;age, which it renders poi&s;onous by its
ap|proach: the&s;e, and an hundred others of the &s;ame kind, probably took
ri&s;e from an anti|pathy which &s;ome have to all animals of the kind. It is
an harmle&s;s, defencele&s;s creature, torpid and unvenemous, and &s;eeking the
darke&s;t retreats, not from the malignity of its nature, but the multitude of
its enemies.</P>
<P>Like all of the frog kind, the toad is torpid in winter. It
chu&s;es then for a retreat either the hollow root of a tree, the cleft of a
rock, or &s;ometimes the bottom of a pond, where it is found in a &s;tate of
&s;eeming in&s;en&s;ibility. As it is very long lived, it is very difficult to
be killed; its &s;kin is tough and cannot be ea&s;ily <PB N="101" REF="105">
pierced; and, though covered with wounds, the animal continues to &s;hew
&s;igns of life, and every part appears in motion. But what &s;hall we &s;ay to
its living for centuries lodged in the bo&s;om of a rock, or ca&s;ed within the
body of an oak tree, without the &s;malle&s;t acce&s;s on any &s;ide either for
nouri&s;hment or air, and yet taken out alive and perfect! Stories of this kind
it would be as ra&s;h to contradict as difficult to believe; we have the
highe&s;t authorities bearing wit|ne&s;s to their truth, and yet the whole
ana|logy of nature &s;eems to arraign them of fal&s;ehood. Bacon a&s;&s;erts
that toads are found in this manner; Doctor Plot a&s;&s;erts the &s;ame; there
is to this day a marble chimney-piece at Chat&s;worth with the print of the
toad upon it, and a tradition of the manner in which it was found. In the
Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences there is an account of a toad found alive
and healthy in the heart of a very thick elm, without the &s;malle&s;t entrance
or egre&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Vide the Year 1719.</BIBL></NOTE>. In
the year 1731 there was another found near Nants in the heart of an old oak,
without the &s;malle&s;t i&s;&s;ue to its cell; and the di&s;coverer was of
opinion, from the &s;ize of the tree, that the animal could not have been
confined there le&s;s than eighty or a hundred years, without &s;u&s;te|nance 
<PB N="102" REF="106"> and without air. To all the&s;e we can only oppo&s;e the
&s;trangene&s;s of the facts; the ne|ce&s;&s;ity this animal appears under of
receiving air; and its dying like all others in the air-pump, when deprived of
this all-&s;u&s;taining fluid. But whether the&s;e be objections to weigh
again&s;t &s;uch re&s;pectable and di&s;intere&s;ted authority, I will not
pretend to determine; certain it is that, if kept in a damp place, the toad
will live for &s;everal months without any food what&s;oever.</P>
<P>To this extraordinary account, which is doubtful, I will add
another not le&s;s &s;o; which is that of toads &s;ucking cancerous brea&s;ts,
and thus extracting the venom and performing a cure. The fir&s;t account we
have of this is in a letter to the Bi&s;hop of Carli&s;le from Doctor Pitfield,
who was the fir&s;t per&s;on of con&s;equence that attended the experiment. His
letter is as follows.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"Your lord&s;hip mu&s;t have taken notice of a
paragraph in the papers with regard to the application of toads to a cancered
brea&s;t. A patient of mine has &s;ent to the neighbourhood of Hungerford, and
brought down the very woman on whom the cure was done. I have, with all the
attention I am capable of, at|tended the operation for eighteen or twenty days,
and am &s;urprized at the phenomenon. <PB N="103" REF="107"> I am in no
expectation of any great &s;ervice from the application; the age,
con&s;titution, and thoroughly cancerous condition of the per&s;on, being
unconquerable barriers to it. How an ailment of that kind, ab&s;olutely local,
in an otherwi&s;e &s;ound habit and of a likely age, might be relieved I cannot
&s;ay. But as to the operation, thus much I can a&s;&s;ert, that there is
neither pain nor nau&s;eou&s;ne&s;s in it. The animal is put into a linen bag
all but its head, and that is held to the part. It has generally in&s;tantly
laid hold of the foule&s;t part of the &s;ore, and &s;ucked with greedine&s;s
until it dropped off dead. It has frequently happened that the creature has
&s;wolen immediately, and from its agonies appeared to be in great pain. I have
weighed them for &s;everal days together, before and after the application, and
found their encrea&s;e of weight, in the different degrees, from a drachm to
near an ounce. They frequently &s;weat exceedingly, and turn quite pale;
&s;ometimes they di&s;gorge, recover, and be|come lively again: I think the
whole &s;cene is &s;urprizing, and a very remarkable piece of natural
hi&s;tory. From the con&s;tant inof|fen&s;ivene&s;s which I have ob&s;erved in
them, I almo&s;t que&s;tion the truth of their poi&s;onous 
<PB N="104" REF="108"> &s;pitting. Many people here expect no great good from
the application of toads to cancers; and where the di&s;order is not
ab&s;olutely local none is to be expected. When it is &s;eated in any part not
to be well come at for extir|pation, I think it is hardly to be imagined, but
that the having it &s;ucked clean as often as you plea&s;e, mu&s;t give great
relief. Every body knows that dogs licking of &s;ores cures them, which is I
&s;uppo&s;e chiefly by keeping them clean. If there is any credit to be given
to hi&s;tory, poi&s;ons have been &s;ucked out. 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Pallentina vulnera lambit ore venena
trakens,</HI></Q> are the words of Lucan on the occa|&s;ion. If the people to
whom the&s;e words are applied did their cure by immediately following the
injection of the poi&s;on, the local confinement of another poi&s;on brings the
ca&s;e to a great degree of &s;imilarity. I hope I have not tired your
Lord&s;hip with my long tale: as it is a true one, and in my appre|hen&s;ion a
curious piece of natural hi&s;tory, I could not forbear communicating it to
you. I own I thought the &s;tory in the papers to be an invention; and when I
con&s;idered the in&s;tructive principle in all animals of
&s;elf-pre&s;ervation, I was confirmed in my di&s;belief: but what I have
related I &s;aw; and all theory <PB N="105" REF="109"> mu&s;t yield to fact. It
is only the Rubeth, the land toad, which has the property of &s;ucking: I
cannot find any the lea&s;t mention of the property in any one of the old
natu|rali&s;ts. My patient can bear to have but one applied in twenty-four
hours. The woman who was cured had them on day and night without
intermi&s;&s;ion for five weeks. Their time of hanging at the brea&s;t has been
from one to &s;ix hours."</Q></P>
<P>Other remarks made upon their method of performing this
extraordinary operation are as follow. 
<Q REND="inline">"Some toads die very &s;oon after they have
&s;ucked; others live about a quarter of an hour, and &s;ome much longer. For
ex|ample, one that was applied about &s;even o'clock &s;ucked till ten, and
died as &s;oon as it was taken from the brea&s;t: another that immediately
&s;ucceeded continued till three o'clock, but dropped dead from the wound: each
&s;welled exceedingly, and of a pale colour. They do not &s;eem to &s;uck
greedily, and often turn their heads away; but during the time of their
&s;ucking, they were heard to &s;mack their lips like a young child<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Briti&s;h Zoology, vol. iii. p. 338.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>From this circum&s;tantial account of the pro|gre&s;s of this
extraordinary application, one could <PB N="106" REF="110"> hardly &s;uppo&s;e
that any doubt could remain of the ingenious ob&s;erver's accuracy; and yet,
from informations which I have received, from authority &s;till more
re&s;pectable, there is much rea&s;on as yet to &s;u&s;pend our a&s;&s;ent. A
lady, who was under the care of the pre&s;ent pre&s;ident of the college of
phy&s;icians, was induced, by her friends, to try the experiment; and as he
&s;aw the ca&s;e was de&s;perate, and that it would quiet her mind as well as
theirs, he permitted the trial. During the whole continuance of their
application, &s;he could never thoroughly perceive that they &s;ucked her; but
that did not prevent their &s;welling and dying, as in the former in&s;tances.
Once indeed, &s;he &s;aid, &s;he thought that one of them &s;eemed to &s;uck;
but the phy&s;ician, and tho&s;e who attended, could not perceive any
appearance of it. Thus, after all, it is a doubt whether the&s;e animals die by
the internal or the external application of the cancerous poi&s;on.</P>
<P>Of this animal there are &s;everal varieties; &s;uch as the
Water and the Land Toad, which probably differ only in the ground-colour of
their &s;kin. In the fir&s;t, it is more inclining to a&s;h-colour, with brown
&s;pots; in the other, the colour is brown, approaching to black. The water
toad is not &s;o large as the other; <PB REF="111">

</FIGURE> <PB N="107" REF="112"> but both equally breed in that
element. The &s;ize of the toad with us is generally from two to four inches
long; but, in the fenny countries of Europe, I have &s;een them much larger;
and not le&s;s than a common crab, when brought to table. But this is nothing
to what they are found in &s;ome of the tropical climates, where travellers
often, for the fir&s;t time, mi&s;take a toad for a tortoi&s;e. Their u&s;ual
&s;ize is from &s;ix to &s;even inches; but there are &s;ome &s;till larger,
and as broad as a plate. Of the&s;e &s;ome are beautifully &s;treaked and
coloured; &s;ome &s;tudded over, as if with pearls; others bri&s;tled with
horns or &s;pines; &s;ome have the head di&s;tinct from the body, while others
have it &s;o &s;unk in, that the animal appears without a head. All the&s;e are
found in the tropical climates, in great abundance; and particularly after a
&s;hower of rain. It is then that the &s;treets &s;eem entirely paved with
them; they then crawl from their retreats, and go into all places, to enjoy
their favourite moi&s;ture. With us the opinion of its raining toads and frogs,
has long been ju&s;tly ex|ploded, but it &s;till is entertained in the tropical
countries; and that not only by the &s;avage na|tives, but the more refined
&s;ettlers, who are apt enough to add the prejudices of other nations to their
own.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="113">It would be a tedious, as well as a
u&s;ele&s;s ta&s;k, to enter into all the minute di&s;criminations of the&s;e
animals, as found in different countries or places; but the Pipal, or the
Surinam Toad, is too &s;trange a creature, not to require an ex|act
de&s;cription. There is not perhaps, in all nature, a more extraordinary
phenomenon, than that of an animal breeding and hatching its young in its back;
from whence, as from a kind of hot bed, they crawl, one after the other, when
come to maturity.</P>
<P>The pipal is in form more hideous than even the common toad,
Nature &s;eeming to have marked all tho&s;e &s;trange mannered ani|mals with
peculiar deformity. The body is flat and broad; the head &s;mall; the jaws,
like tho&s;e of a mole, are extended, and evidently formed for rooting in the
ground: the &s;kin of the neck forms a &s;ort of wrinkled collar: the colour of
the head is of a dark che&s;nut, and the eyes are &s;mall: the back, which is
very broad, is of a lighti&s;h grey, and &s;eems covered over with a number of
&s;mall eyes, which are round, and placed at nearly equal di&s;tances. The&s;e
eyes are very different from what they &s;eem; they are the animal's eggs,
covered with their &s;hells, and placed there for hatching. The&s;e eggs are
buried deep in the &s;kin, and in <PB N="109" REF="114"> the beginning of
incubation but ju&s;t appear; and are very vi&s;ible when the young animal is
about to bur&s;t from its confinement. They are of a reddi&s;h, &s;hining
yellow colour; and the &s;paces between them are full of &s;mall warts,
re&s;embling pearls.</P>
<P>This is their &s;ituation, previous to their coming forth; but
nothing &s;o much demands our admiration, as the manner of their pro|duction.
The eggs, when formed in the ovary, are &s;ent, by &s;ome internal canals,
which ana|tomi&s;ts have not hitherto de&s;cribed, to lie and come to maturity
under the bony &s;ub&s;tance of the back: in this &s;tate they are impregnated
by the male, who&s;e &s;eed finds its way by pores very &s;ingularly contrived,
and pierces not only the &s;kin but the perio&s;teum: the &s;kin, however, is
&s;till apparently entire, and forms a very thick covering over the whole
brood; but as they advance to maturity, at different intervals, one after
another, the egg &s;eems to &s;tart forward and burgeon from the back, becomes
more yellow, and at la&s;t breaks; when the young one puts forth its head: it
&s;till, however, keeps its &s;ituation, until it has acquired a proper degree
of &s;trength, and then it leaves the &s;hell, but &s;till continues to keep
upon the back of the parent. In this manner the pipal is &s;een travelling with
<PB N="110" REF="115"> her wonderous family on her back, in all the different
&s;tages of maturity. Some of the &s;trange progeny, not yet come to
&s;ufficient per|fection, appear quite torpid, and as yet without life in the
egg: others &s;eem ju&s;t beginning to ri&s;e through the &s;kin; here peeping
forth from the &s;hell; and there, having entirely for&s;aken their pri&s;on:
&s;ome are &s;porting at large upon the parent's back; and others de&s;cending
to the ground, to try their own fortune below.</P>
<P>Such is the de&s;cription given us of this &s;trange production,
by Seba; in which he dif|fers from Ruy&s;ch, who affirms, that the young ones
are bred in the back of the male only, where the female lays her eggs. I have
fol|lowed Seba, however; not becau&s;e he is better authority, but becau&s;e he
is more po&s;itive of the truth of his account, and a&s;&s;erts, a&s;&s;uredly,
that the eggs are found on the back of the female only. Many circum&s;tances,
however, are wanting towards completing his inform|ation; &s;uch as a
de&s;cription of the pa&s;&s;age by which the egg finds its way into the back;
the manner of its fecundation; the time of ge&s;ta|tion; as al&s;o an hi&s;tory
of the manners of this &s;trange animal it&s;elf: but, by a prolixity that too
much prevails among naturali&s;ts at pre&s;ent, he leaves the mo&s;t
intere&s;ting object of curio&s;ity, <PB N="111" REF="116"> to give us a
detailed de&s;cription of the legs and claws of the pipal, about which we have
very little concern.</P>
<P>The male pipal is every way larger than the female, and has the
&s;kin le&s;s tightly drawn round the body. The whole body is covered with
pu&s;tules, re&s;embling pearls; and the belly, which is of a bright yellow,
&s;eems as if it were &s;ewed up from the throat to the vent, a &s;eam being
&s;een to run in that direction. This ani|mal, like the re&s;t of the frog
kind, is mo&s;t pro|bably harmle&s;s; though we are told of terrible effects
re&s;ulting from its powder when calcined. This, however, mu&s;t certainly be
fal&s;e: no creature whatever, when calcined, can be poi|&s;onous; for the fire
burns away whatever might have been dangerous in their compo&s;ition: all
animal &s;ub&s;tances, when calcined, being entirely the &s;ame.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of Lizards in General.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is &s;carce a naturali&s;t that has treated of Lizards,
but has a particular manner of ranking them, in the &s;cale of animated nature.
Ray, rather &s;truck with the number of their legs, than their habits and
conformation, has ex|alted them among quadrupedes; while Linnaeus, attentive
only to their long &s;lender forms, has degraded them among &s;erpents.
Bri&s;&s;on gives them a di&s;tinct cla&s;s by them&s;elves, under the name of
Reptiles. Klein gives them a cla&s;s inferior to bea&s;ts, under the name of
Naked Quadrupedes. Some, in &s;hort, from their &s;caly covering, and
fondne&s;s for the water, have given them to the fi&s;hes; while there have not
been wanting naturali&s;ts who have cla&s;&s;ed them with in&s;ects, as the
&s;maller kinds of this cla&s;s &s;eem to demand.</P>
<P>It is indeed no ea&s;y matter to tell to what cla&s;s in nature
lizards are chiefly allied. They are unju&s;tly rai&s;ed to the rank of
bea&s;ts, as they bring forth eggs, di&s;pen&s;e with breathing, and are not
covered with hair. They cannot be placed among fi&s;hes, as the majority of
them <PB N="113" REF="118"> live upon land: they are excluded from the
&s;erpent tribe, by their feet, upon which they run with &s;ome celerity; and
from the in&s;ects, by their &s;ize; for though the Newt may be looked upon in
this contemptible light, a Cro|codile would be a terrible in&s;ect indeed. Thus
lizards are, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, excluded from every rank; while they exhibit
&s;omewhat of the properties of all; the legs and celerity of the quadrupede; a
facility of creeping through narrow and intricate ways, like the &s;erpent; and
a power of living in the water, like fi&s;hes: however, though endued with
the&s;e various powers, they have no real advantages over any other cla&s;s of
animated nature; for what they gain in aptitude for one element, they lo&s;e in
their fitne&s;s for another. Thus, between both, they are an aukward, ungainly
tribe; neither &s;o alert upon land, nor &s;o nimble in the water, as the
re&s;pective inhabitants of either abode: and, indeed, this holds through all
nature, that, in proportion as the &s;eeming advantages of inferior animals are
multiplied, their real ones are abridged; and all their in&s;tincts are
weakened and lo&s;t, by the variety of channels into which they are
divided.</P>
<P>As lizards thus differ from every other cla&s;s of animals, they
al&s;o differ widely from each <PB N="114" REF="119"> other. With re&s;pect to
&s;ize, no cla&s;s of beings has its ranks &s;o oppo&s;ite. What, for
in&s;tance, can be more removed than the &s;mall Cameleon, an inch long, and
the Alligator of the river Amazons, above twenty-&s;even feet? To an
in|attentive ob&s;erver, they would appear entirely of different kinds; and
Seba wonders how they ever came to be cla&s;&s;ed together.</P>
<P>The colour of the&s;e animals al&s;o is very va|rious, as they
are found of a hundred different hues, green, blue, red, che&s;nut, yellow,
&s;pot|ted, &s;treaked, and marbled. Were colour alone capable of
con&s;tituting beauty, the lizard would often plea&s;e; but there is
&s;omething &s;o repre&s;&s;ing in the animal's figure, that the brilliancy of
its &s;cales, or the variety of its &s;pots, only tend to give an air of more
exqui&s;ite venom of greater malignity. The figure of the&s;e animals is not
le&s;s various: &s;ometimes &s;wolen in the belly; &s;ometimes pur&s;ed up at
the throat; &s;ometimes with a rough &s;et of &s;pines on the back, like the
teeth of a &s;aw; &s;ometimes with teeth, at others with none; &s;ometimes
venomous, at others harmle&s;s, and even philanthropic: &s;ometimes &s;mooth
and even; &s;ometimes with a long, &s;len|der tail; and often with a &s;horter
blunt one.</P>
<P>But their greate&s;t di&s;tinction ari&s;es from their manner of
bringing forth their young. Fir&s;tly, <PB N="115" REF="120"> &s;ome of them
are viviparous. Secondly, &s;ome are oviparous; and which may be con&s;idered
in three di&s;tinct ways. Thirdly, &s;ome bring forth &s;mall &s;pawn, like
fi&s;hes. The Crocodile, the Iguana, and all the larger kinds, bring forth
eggs, which are hatched by the heat of the &s;un: the animals that i&s;&s;ue
from them are complete upon leaving the &s;hell; and their fir&s;t efforts are
to run to &s;eek food in their pro|per element. The viviparous kinds, in which
are all the &s;alamanders, come forth alive from the body of the female,
perfect and active, and &s;uffer no &s;ucceeding change. But tho&s;e which are
bred in the water, and, as we have rea&s;on to think, from &s;pawn, &s;uffer a
very con&s;iderable change in their form. They are produced with an external
&s;kin or covering, that &s;ometimes enclo&s;es their feet, and gives them a
&s;erpentine appearance. To this fal&s;e &s;kin, fins are added, above and
below the tail, that &s;erve the animal for &s;wimming; but when the fal&s;e
&s;kin drops off, the&s;e drop off al&s;o; and then the lizard, with its four
feet, is completely formed, and for&s;akes the water.</P>
<P>From hence it appears, that of this tribe there are three
di&s;tinct kinds, differently pro|duced, and mo&s;t probably very different in
their formation. But the hi&s;tory of the&s;e animals is <PB N="116" REF="121">
very ob&s;cure; and we are as yet incapable of laying the line that &s;eparates
them. All we know, as was &s;aid before, is, that the great animals of this
kind are <HI>mo&s;tly</HI> produced perfect from the egg; the &s;alamanders are
<HI>generally</HI> vi|viparous; and <HI>&s;ome</HI> of the water lizards
imper|fectly produced. In all the&s;e mo&s;t unfini&s;hed productions of
Nature, if I may &s;o call them, the varieties in their &s;tructure encrea&s;es
in pro|portion to their imperfections. A poet would &s;ay, that Nature grew
tired of the nau&s;eous formation; and left accident to fini&s;h the re&s;t of
her handy work.</P>
<P>However, the three kinds have many points of &s;imilitude; and,
in all their varieties of figure, colour, and production, this tribe is
ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed, and &s;trongly marked. They have all four &s;hort
legs; the two fore feet &s;omewhat re&s;embling a man's hand and arm. They have
tails almo&s;t as thick as the body at the beginning, and that generally run
tapering to a point. They are all amphibious al&s;o; equally capable of living
upon land and water; and formed internally in the &s;ame manner with the
tortoi&s;e, and other animals, that can continue a long time without
re&s;pira|tion: in other words, their lungs are not &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to
continue life and circulation, <PB N="117" REF="122"> but that their play may
be &s;topped for &s;ome con&s;iderable time, while the blood performs its
circuit round the body by a &s;horter commu|nication.</P>
<P>The&s;e are differences that &s;ufficiently &s;eparate lizards
from all other animals; but it will be very difficult to fix the limits that
di&s;tingui&s;h the three kinds from each other. The <HI>crocodile</HI> tribe,
and its affinities, are &s;ufficiently di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from all the re&s;t,
by their &s;ize and fierce|ne&s;s; the <HI>&s;alamander</HI> tribe is
di&s;tingui&s;hed by their deformity, their frog-like heads, the &s;hortne&s;s
of their &s;nouts, their &s;wolen belly, and their viviparous production. With
regard to the re&s;t, which we may denominate the cameleon or lizard kind,
&s;ome of which bring forth from the egg, and &s;ome of which are im|perfectly
formed from &s;pawn, we mu&s;t groupe them under one head, and leave time to
unravel the re&s;t of their hi&s;tory.</P>

<PB N="118" REF="123">
<HEAD>CHAP. V. Of the Crocodile and its Affinities.</HEAD>
<P>THE Crocodile is an animal placed at a happy di&s;tance from the
inhabitants of Europe, and formidable only in tho&s;e regions where men are
&s;carce, and arts are but little known. In all the cultivated and populous
parts of the world, the great animals are entirely bani&s;hed, or rarely
&s;een. The appearance of &s;uch rai&s;es at once a whole country up in arms to
oppo&s;e their force; and their lives generally pay the forfeit of their
temerity. The crocodile, therefore, that was once &s;o terrible along the banks
of the river Nile, is now neither &s;o large, nor its numbers &s;o great as
formerly. The arts of mankind have, through a cour&s;e of ages, powerfully
operated to its de&s;truction; and, though it is &s;ometimes &s;een, it appears
comparatively ti|morous and feeble.</P>
<P>To look for this animal in all its natural terrors, grown to an
enormous &s;ize, propa|gated in &s;urprizing numbers, and committing
uncea&s;ing deva&s;tations, we mu&s;t go to the uninhabited regions of Africa
and America, to tho&s;e immen&s;e rivers that roll through ex|ten&s;ive

arts have never penetrated, where force only makes di&s;tinction, and the
mo&s;t powerful animals exert their &s;trength with confidence and &s;ecurity.
Tho&s;e that &s;ail up the river Amazons, or the river Niger, well know how
numerous and terrible tho&s;e animals are in &s;uch parts of the world. In both
the&s;e rivers, they are found from eighteen to twenty-&s;even feet long; and
&s;ometimes lying as clo&s;e to each other, as a raft of timber upon one of our
&s;treams. There they indolently ba&s;k on the &s;urface, no way di&s;turbed at
the approach of an enemy, &s;ince, from the repeated trials of their
&s;trength, they found none that they were not able to &s;ubdue.</P>
<P>Of this terrible animal there are two kinds; the Crocodile,
properly &s;o called, and the Cay|man or Alligator. Travellers, however, have
rather made the di&s;tinction than Nature; for in the general outline, and in
the nature of the&s;e two animals they are entirely the &s;ame. It would be
&s;peaking more properly to call the&s;e animals the Crocodiles of the
ea&s;tern and the we&s;tern world; for in books of voyages, they are &s;o
entirely confounded together, that there is no knowing whether the A&s;iatic
animal be the cro|codile of A&s;ia, or the alligator of the we&s;tern world.
The di&s;tinctions u&s;ually made between <PB N="120" REF="126"> the crocodile
and alligator are the&s;e: the body of the crocodile is more &s;lender than
that of the alligator; its &s;nout runs off tapering from the forehead, like
that of a greyhound; while that of the other is indented, like the no&s;e of a
lap-dog. The crocodile has a much wider &s;wallow, and is of an a&s;h-colour;
the alligator is black, varied with white, and is thought not to be &s;o
mi&s;chievous. All the&s;e di&s;tinctions, however, are very &s;light, and can
be reckoned little more than minute variations.</P>
<P>This animal grows to a great length, being &s;ometimes found
thirty feet long, from the tip of the &s;nout to the end of the tail: its
mo&s;t u&s;ual length, however, is eighteen. One which was di&s;&s;ected by the
Je&s;uits at Siam was of the latter dimen&s;ions; and as the de&s;cription
which is given of it, both externally and inter|nally, is the mo&s;t accurate
known of this noted animal, I mu&s;t beg leave to give it as I find it, though
&s;omewhat tedious. It was eighteen feet and an half, French mea&s;ure, in
length; of which the tail was no le&s;s than five feet and an half, and the
head and neck above two feet and an half. It was four feet nine inches in
circumference, where thicke&s;t. The fore legs had the &s;ame parts and
conformation as the arms of a man, both within and without. The 
<PB N="121" REF="127"> hands, if they may be &s;o called, had five fingers; the
two la&s;t of which had no nails, and were of a conical figure. The hinder
legs, including the thigh and paw, were two feet two inches long; the paws,
from the joint to the extremity of the longe&s;t claws, were above nine inches:
they were divided into four toes, of which three were armed with large claws,
the longe&s;t of which was an inch and an half: the&s;e toes were united by a
membrane, like tho&s;e of a duck, but much thicker. The head was long, and had
a little ri&s;ing at the top; but the re&s;t was flat, and e&s;pecially towards
the extremity of the jaws. It was covered by a &s;kin, which adhered firmly to
the &s;kull and to the jaws. The &s;kull was rough and unequal in &s;everal
places; and about the middle of the forehead there were two bony cre&s;ts,
about two inches high: the &s;kull between the&s;e two cre&s;ts was proof
again&s;t a mu&s;quet-ball; for it only rendered the part a little white that
it &s;truck again&s;t. The eye was very &s;mall, in proportion to the re&s;t of
the body, and was &s;o placed within its orbit, that the outward part, when the
lid was clo&s;ed, was only an inch long, and the line running parallel to the
opening of the jaws. It was covered with a double lid, one within and one
without: that within, like the nictitating membrane in birds, was folded in the
great corner of the eye, and had <PB N="122" REF="128"> a motion towards the
tail, but being tran&s;|parent, it covered the eye without hindering the
&s;ight. The iris was very large in proportion to the globe of the eye, and was
of a yellowi&s;h grey colour. Above the eye the ear was placed, which opened
from above downwards, as if it were by a kind of &s;pring, by means of a
&s;olid, thick, cartilaginous &s;ub&s;tance. The no&s;e was placed in the
middle of the upper jaw, near an inch from its extremity, and was perfectly
round and flat, being near two inches in diameter, of a black, &s;oft, &s;pongy
&s;ub&s;tance, not unlike the no&s;e of a dog. The jaws &s;eemed to &s;hut one
within another; and nothing can be more fal&s;e than that the animal's under
jaw is without mo|tion; it moves, like the lower jaw in all other animals,
while the upper is fixed to the &s;kull and ab&s;olutely immoveable. The animal
had twenty-&s;even cutting teeth in the upper jaw, and fifteen in the lower,
with &s;everal void &s;paces between them: they were thick at the bottom, and
&s;harp at the point, being all of different &s;izes, except ten large hooked
ones, &s;ix of which were in the lower jaw, and four in the upper. The mouth
was fifteen inches in length, and eight and an half in breadth, where
broade&s;t. The di&s;tance of the two jaws, when opened as wide as they could
be, was fifteen inches and an half: this is a very wide yawn, and could
ea&s;ily enough take in the <PB N="123" REF="129"> body of a man. The colour of
the body was of a dark brown on the upper part, and of a whiti&s;h citron
below, with large &s;pots of both colours on the &s;ides. From the &s;houlders
to the extremity of the tail, the animal was covered with large &s;cales, of a
&s;quare form, di&s;po&s;ed like parallel girdles, and fifty-two in num|ber;
but tho&s;e near the tail were not &s;o thick as the re&s;t. The creature was
covered not only with the&s;e, but all over with a coat of armour; which,
however, was not proof again&s;t a mu&s;|quet-ball, contrary to what has been
commonly a&s;&s;erted: however, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the attitude
in which the animal was placed, might contribute to render the &s;kin more
penetrable; for probably if the ball had &s;truck obliquely again&s;t the
&s;hell, it would have flown off. Tho&s;e parts of the girdles underneath the
belly were of a whiti&s;h colour, and were made up of &s;cales of divers
&s;hapes, but not &s;o hard as tho&s;e on the back.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the internal parts of the ani|mal, the gullet
was large in proportion to the mouth; and a ball of wood, as large as one's
head, readily ran down, and was drawn up again. The guts were but &s;hort, in
compari&s;on, being not &s;o long as the animal's body. The tongue, which
&s;ome have erroneou&s;ly a&s;&s;erted <PB N="124" REF="130"> this animal was
without, con&s;i&s;ted of a thick &s;pongy &s;oft fle&s;h, and was &s;trongly
connected to the lower jaw. The heart was of the &s;ize of a calf's, of a
bright red colour, the blood pa&s;&s;ing as well from the veins to the aorta as
into the lungs. There was no bladder; but the kidneys &s;ent the urine to be
di&s;charged by the anus. There were &s;ixty-two joints in the back-bone,
which, though very clo&s;ely united, had &s;ufficient play to enable the animal
to bend like a bow to the right and the left; &s;o that what we hear of
e&s;caping the creature by turning out of the right line, and of the animal's
not being able to wheel readily after its prey, &s;eems to be fa|bulous. It is
mo&s;t likely the crocodile can turn with great ea&s;e, for the joints of its
back are not &s;tiffer than tho&s;e of other animals which we know by
experience can wheel about very nimbly for their &s;ize.</P>
<P>Such is the figure and conformation of this formidable animal,
that unpeoples countries, and makes the mo&s;t navigable rivers de&s;art and
dangerous. They are &s;een, in &s;ome places, ly|ing for whole hours, and even
days, &s;tretched in the &s;un, and motionle&s;s; &s;o that one not u&s;ed to
them, might mi&s;take them for trunks of trees, covered with a rough and dry
bark; but the mi&s;take would &s;oon be fatal, if not pre|vented: 
<PB N="125" REF="131"> for the torpid animal, at the near approach of any
living thing, darts upon it with in&s;tant &s;wiftne&s;s, and at once drags it
down to the bottom. In the times of an inun|dation, they &s;ometimes enter the
cottages of the natives, where the dreadful vi&s;itant &s;eizes the fir&s;t
animal it meets with. There have been &s;everal examples of their taking a man
out of a canoe in the &s;ight of his companions, with|out their being able to
lend him any a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>The &s;trength of every part of the crocodile is very great; and
its arms, both offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive, irre&s;i&s;tible. We have &s;een,
from the &s;hortne&s;s of its legs, the amazing &s;trength of the tortoi&s;e:
but what is the &s;trength of &s;uch an animal, compared to that of the
crocodile, who&s;e legs are very &s;hort and who&s;e &s;ize is &s;o &s;uperior.
The back-bone is jointed in the firme&s;t manner; the mu&s;cles of the fore and
hinder legs are vigorous and &s;trong; and its whole form calculated for force.
Its teeth are &s;harp, numerous and formidable; its claws are long and
tenaceous; but its principal in&s;trument of de&s;truction is the tail: with a
&s;ingle blow of this it has often overturned a canoe, and &s;eized upon the
poor &s;avage its conductor.</P>
<P>Though not &s;o powerful, yet it is very ter|rible even upon
land. The crocodile &s;eldom, <PB N="126" REF="132"> except when pre&s;&s;ed by
hunger, or with a view of depo&s;iting its eggs, leaves the water. Its u&s;ual
method is to float along upon the &s;urface and &s;eize whatever animals come
within its reach; but when this method fails, it then goes clo&s;er to the
bank. Di&s;appointed of its fi&s;hy prey, it there waits covered up among the
&s;edges, in patient expectation of &s;ome land animal that comes to drink; the
dog, the bull, the tiger, or man him&s;elf. Nothing is to be &s;een of the
in&s;iduous de&s;troyer as the animal approaches; nor is its retreat
di&s;covered till it be too late for &s;afety. It &s;eizes the victim with a
&s;pring, and goes at a bound much fa&s;ter than &s;o unwieldy an animal could
be thought capable of exerting; then having &s;ecured the creature with both
teeth and claws, it drags it into the water, in&s;tantly &s;inks with it to the
bottom, and in this manner quickly drowns it.</P>
<P>Sometimes it happens that the creature the crocodile has thus
&s;urprized e&s;capes from its gra&s;p wounded, and makes off from the
river|&s;ide. In &s;uch a ca&s;e, the tyrant pur&s;ues with all its force, and
often &s;eizes it a &s;econd time; for though &s;eemingly heavy, the crocodile
runs with great celerity. In this manner it is &s;ome|times &s;een above half a
mile from the bank, in <PB N="127" REF="133"> pur&s;uit of an animal wounded
beyond the power of e&s;caping, and then dragging it back to the river-&s;ide,
where it fea&s;ts in &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>It often happens, in its depredations along the bank, that the
crododile &s;eizes on a crea|ture as formidable as it&s;elf, and meets with a
mo&s;t de&s;perate re&s;i&s;tance. We are told of fre|quent combats between the
crocodile and the tiger. All creatures of the tiger kind are con|tinually
oppre&s;&s;ed by a parching thir&s;t that keeps them in the vicinity of great
rivers, whither they de&s;cend to drink very frequently. It is upon the&s;e
occa&s;ions that they are &s;eized by the crocodile; and they die not
unrevenged. The in&s;tant they are &s;eized upon, they turn with the greate&s;t
agility, and force their claws into the crocodile's eyes, while he plunges with
his fierce antagoni&s;t into the river. There they continue to &s;truggle for
&s;ome time, till at la&s;t the tiger is drowned.</P>
<P>In this manner the crocodile &s;eizes and de&s;troys all
animals, and is equally dreaded by all. There is no animal but man alone that
can com|bat it with &s;ucce&s;s. We are a&s;&s;ured by Labat, that a Negro,
with no other weapons than a knife in his right hand, and his left arm wrapped
round with a cow hide, ventures boldly to at|tack this animal in its own
element. As &s;oon <PB N="128" REF="134"> as he approaches the crocodile, he
pre&s;ents his left arm, which the animal &s;wallows mo&s;t gree|dily; but
&s;ticking in its throat, the Negro has time to give it &s;everal &s;tabs under
the throat; and the water al&s;o getting in it at the mouth, which is held
involuntarily open, the creature is &s;oon bloated up as big as a tun, and
expires.</P>
<P>To us who live at a di&s;tance from the rapacity of the&s;e
animals, the&s;e &s;tories appear &s;trange, and yet mo&s;t probably are true.
From not having &s;een any thing &s;o formidable or bold in the circle of our
own experience, we are not to determine upon the wonderful tran&s;actions in
di&s;tant climates. It is probable that the&s;e, and a number of more dreadful
encounters, happen every day among tho&s;e fore&s;ts and in tho&s;e rivers
where the mo&s;t formidable animals are known to re&s;ide; where the elephant
and the rhinoceros, the tiger and the hipopotamos, the &s;hark and the
crocodile, have frequent op|portunities of meeting, and every day of re|newing
their engagements.</P>
<P>Whatever be the truth of the&s;e accounts, certain it is that
crocodiles are taken by the Siame&s;e in great abundance. The natives of that
empire &s;eem particularly fond of the capture of all the great animals with
which their country abounds. We have already &s;een their &s;ucce&s;s 
<PB N="129" REF="135"> in taking and taming the elephant; nor are they le&s;s
powerful in exerting their dominion over the crocodile. The manner of taking it
in Siam is by throwing three or four &s;trong nets acro&s;s a river, at proper
di&s;tances from each other; &s;o that if the animal breaks through the
fir&s;t, it may be caught by one of the re&s;t. When it is fir&s;t taken, it
employs the tail, which is the grand in&s;trument of &s;trength, with great
force; but after many un&s;ucce&s;sful &s;truggles, the animal's &s;trength is
at la&s;t exhau&s;ted. Then the natives approach their pri&s;oner in boats, and
pierce him with their weapons in the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> tender parts till he is
weakened with the lo&s;s of blood. When he has done &s;tirring, they begin by
tying up his mouth, and with the &s;ame cord they fa&s;ten his head to his
tail, which la&s;t they bend back like a bow. However, they are not yet
perfectly &s;ecure from his fury; but, for their greater &s;afety, they tie his
fore feet as well as tho&s;e behind to the top of his back. The&s;e precautions
are not u&s;ele&s;s; for if they were to omit them, the crocodile would &s;oon
recover &s;trength enough to do a great deal of mi&s;|chief.</P>
<P>The crocodile thus brought into &s;ubjection, or bred up young,
is u&s;ed to divert and enter|tain the great men of the ea&s;t. It is often 
<PB N="130" REF="136"> managed like an hor&s;e; a curb is put into its mouth,
and the rider directs it as he thinks pro|per. Though aukwardly formed, it does
not fail to proceed with &s;ome degree of &s;wiftne&s;s; and is thought to move
as fa&s;t as &s;ome of the mo&s;t unwieldy of our own animals, the hog or the
cow. Some, indeed, a&s;&s;ert that no animal could e&s;cape it, but for its
difficulty in turning; but to this re&s;ource we could wi&s;h none would
tru&s;t who are &s;o unhappy as to find them&s;elves in danger.</P>
<P>Along the rivers of Africa this animal is &s;ome|times taken in
the &s;ame manner as the &s;hark. Several Europeans go together in a large
boat, and throw out a piece of beef upon a hook and &s;trong fortified line,
which the cro|codile &s;eizing and &s;wallowing, is drawn along, floundering
and &s;truggling until its &s;trength is quite exhau&s;ted, when it is pierced
in the belly, which is its tendere&s;t part; and thus after num|berle&s;s
wounds is drawn a&s;hore. In this part of the world al&s;o, as well as at Siam,
the cro|codile makes an object of &s;avage pomp near the palaces of their
monarchs. Philips informs us that at Sabi, on the &s;lave coa&s;t, there are
two pools of water near the royal palace, where cro|codiles are bred as we
breed carp in our ponds in Europe.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="137">Hitherto I have been de&s;cribing the
crocodile as it is found in unpeopled countries, and un|di&s;turbed by frequent
encounters with mankind. In this &s;tate it is fierce and cruel, attacking
every object that &s;eems endued with motion: but in Egypt, and other countries
long peopled, where the inhabitants are civilized and the rivers fre|quented,
this animal is &s;olitary and fearful. So far from coming to attack a man, it
&s;inks at his ap|proach with the utmo&s;t precipitation; and, as if
&s;en&s;ible of &s;uperior power, ever declines the en|gagement. We have &s;een
more than one in|&s;tance in animated nature of the contempt which at fir&s;t
the lower orders of the creation have for man, till they have experienced his
powers of de|&s;truction. The lion and the tiger among bea&s;ts, the whale
among fi&s;hes, the albatro&s;s and the penguin among birds, meet the fir&s;t
encounters of man without dread or apprehen&s;ion; but they &s;oon learn to
acknowledge his &s;uperiority; and take refuge from his power in the deepe&s;t
fa&s;tne&s;&s;es of nature. This may account for the different characters which
have been given us of the crocodile and the alligator by travellers at
different times: &s;ome de&s;cribing them as harmle&s;s and fearful, as ever
avoiding the &s;ight of a man, and preying only upon fi&s;hes; others ranking
them among the de&s;troyers of <PB N="132" REF="138"> nature; de&s;cribing them
as furni&s;hed with &s;trength and impelled by malignity to do mi&s;|chief;
repre&s;enting them as the greate&s;t ene|mies of mankind, and particularly
de&s;irous of human prey. The truth is, the animal has been ju&s;tly
de&s;cribed by both; being &s;uch as it is found in places differently peopled
or dif|ferently civilized. Wherever the crocodile has reigned long
unmole&s;ted, it is there fierce, bold, and dangerous; wherever it has been
harra&s;&s;ed by mankind, its retreats invaded, and its numbers de&s;troyed, it
is there timorous and inoffen&s;ive.</P>
<P>In &s;ome places, therefore, this animal, in&s;tead of being
formidable, is not only inoffen&s;ive, but is cheri&s;hed and admired. In the
river San Do|mingo, the crocodiles are the mo&s;t inoffen&s;ive animals in
nature; the children play with them, and ride about on their backs; they even
beat them &s;ometimes without receiving the &s;malle&s;t injury. It is true the
inhabitants are very careful of this gentle breed, and con&s;ider them as
harmle&s;s dome&s;tics.</P>
<P>It is probable that the &s;mell of mu&s;k, which all the&s;e
animals exhale, may render them agreeable to the &s;avages of that part of
Africa. They are often known to take the part of this animal which contains the
mu&s;k and wear it as a per|fume <PB N="133" REF="139"> about their per&s;ons.
Travellers are not agreed in what part of the body the&s;e mu&s;k|bags are
contained; &s;ome &s;ay in the ears; &s;ome, in the parts of generation; but
the mo&s;t pro|bable opinion is, that this mu&s;ky &s;ub&s;tance is ama&s;&s;ed
in glands under the legs and arms. From what&s;oever part of the body this
odour proceeds, it is very &s;trong and powerful, tinc|turing the fle&s;h of
the whole body with its ta&s;te and &s;mell. The crocodile's fle&s;h is at
be&s;t very bad tough eating; but unle&s;s the mu&s;k-bags be &s;eparated it is
in&s;upportable. The Negroes them&s;elves cannot well dige&s;t the fle&s;h; but
then, a crocodile's egg is to them the mo&s;t delicate mor&s;el in the world.
Even &s;a|vages exhibit their epicures as well as we; and one of true ta&s;te
will &s;pare neither pains nor danger to furni&s;h him&s;elf with his favourite
re|pa&s;t. For this rea&s;on, he often watches the places where the female
comes to lay her eggs, and upon her retiring &s;eizes the booty.</P>
<P>All crocodiles breed near fre&s;h waters; and though they are
&s;ometimes found in the &s;ea, yet that may be con&s;idered rather as a place
of excur&s;ion than abode. They produce their young by eggs, as was &s;aid
above; and for this purpo&s;e the female when &s;he comes to lay, choo&s;es a
place by the &s;ide of a river, or &s;ome <PB N="134" REF="140"> fre&s;h water
lake, to depo&s;it her brood in. She always pitches upon an exten&s;ive &s;andy
&s;hore, where &s;he may dig a hole without danger of de|tection from the
ground being fre&s;h turned up. The &s;hore mu&s;t al&s;o be gentle and
&s;helving to the water, for the greater convenience of the animal's going and
returning; and a convenient place mu&s;t be found near the edge of the
&s;tream, that the young may have a &s;horter way to go. When all the&s;e
requi&s;ites are adju&s;ted, the animal is &s;een cautiou&s;ly &s;tealing up on
&s;hore to depo&s;it her burthen. The pre&s;ence of a man, a bea&s;t, or even a
bird, is &s;ufficient to deter her at that time; and if &s;he perceives any
creature looking on, &s;he infallibly returns. If, however, nothing appears,
&s;he then goes to work, &s;cratching up the &s;and with her fore paws, and
making a hole pretty deep in the &s;hore. There &s;he de|po&s;its from eighty
to an hundred eggs, of the &s;ize of a tennis-ball, and of the &s;ame figure,
covered with a tough white &s;kin like parchment. She takes above an hour to
perform this ta&s;k; and then covering up the place &s;o artfully that it can
&s;carcely be perceived, &s;he goes back to return again the next day. Upon her
return, with the &s;ame precaution as before, &s;he lays about the &s;ame
number of eggs; and the day following al&s;o a like number. Thus having 
<PB N="135" REF="141"> depo&s;ited her whole quantity, and having co|vered them
clo&s;e up in the &s;and, they are &s;oon vivified by the heat of the &s;un;
and at the end of thirty days, the young ones begin to break open the &s;hell.
At this time the female is in|&s;tinctively taught that her young ones want
relief; and &s;he goes up on land to &s;cratch away the &s;and and &s;et them
free. Her brood quickly avail them&s;elves of their liberty; a part run
unguided to the water; another part a&s;cend the back of the female, and are
carried thither in greater &s;afety. But the moment they arrive at the water,
all natural connexion is at an end: when the female has introduced her young to
their natural element, not only &s;he, but the male, become among the number of
their mo&s;t formidable enemies, and devour as many of them as they can. The
whole brood &s;catters into different parts at the bottom; by far the
greate&s;t number are de&s;troyed; and the re&s;t find &s;afety in their
agility or minutene&s;s.</P>
<P>But it is not the crocodile alone that is thus found to thin
their numbers; the eggs of this animal are not only a delicious fea&s;t to the
&s;avage, but are eagerly &s;ought after by every bea&s;t and bird of prey. The
ichneumon was erected into a deity among the ancients for its &s;ucce&s;s in
de&s;troying the eggs of the&s;e mon&s;ters: <PB N="136" REF="142"> at
pre&s;ent that &s;pecies of the vulture called the Gallinazo is their mo&s;t
prevailing enemy. All along the banks of great rivers, for thou&s;ands of
miles, the crocodile is &s;een to propagate in numbers that would &s;oon
over-run the earth, but for the vulture, that &s;eems appointed by Providence
to abridge its fecundity. The&s;e birds are ever found in greate&s;t numbers
where the crocodile is mo&s;t numerous; and hiding them&s;elves within the
thick branches of the trees that &s;hade the banks of the river, they watch the
female in &s;ilence, and permit her to lay all her eggs without interruption.
Then when &s;he has retired, they encourage each other with cries to the
&s;poil; and flocking all together upon the hidden trea&s;ure, tear up the
eggs, and devour them in a much quicker time than they were depo&s;ited. Nor
are they le&s;s diligent in at|tending the female while &s;he is carrying her
young to the water; for if any one of them happens to drop by the way, it is
&s;ure to receive no mercy.</P>
<P>Such is the extraordinary account given us by late travellers of
the propagation of this animal; an account adopted by Linnaeus and the mo&s;t
learned naturali&s;ts of the age<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ulloa.</BIBL></NOTE>. Yet, if one might argue from the
general analogy <PB N="137" REF="143"> of nature, the crocodile's devouring her
own young when &s;he gets to the water &s;eems doubtful. This may be a &s;tory
rai&s;ed from the general idea of this animal's rapacious cruelty; when, in
fact, the crocodile only &s;eems more cruel than other animals becau&s;e it has
more power to do mi&s;chief. It is probable that it is not more dive&s;ted of
parental tenderne&s;s than other creatures; and I am the more led to think &s;o
from the peculiar formation of one of the crocodile kind. This is called the
Open Bellied Crocodile, and is furni&s;hed with a fal&s;e belly like the
opo&s;&s;um, where the young creep out and in as their dangers or
nece&s;&s;ities require. The crocodile thus furni&s;hed at lea&s;t cannot be
&s;aid to be an enemy to her own young, &s;ince &s;he thus gives them more than
parental protection. It is probable al&s;o that this Open Bellied Cro|codile is
viviparous, and fo&s;ters her young that are prematurely excluded in this
&s;econd womb, until they come to proper maturity.</P>
<P>How long the crocodile lives we are not certainly informed; if
we may believe Ari&s;totle, it lives the age of a man; but the ancients &s;o
much amu&s;ed them&s;elves in inventing fables concerning this animal, that
even truth from them is &s;u&s;picious. What we know for certain from the
ancients is, that among the various <PB N="138" REF="144"> animals that were
produced to fight in the am|phitheatre at Rome, the combat of the cro|codile
was not wanting<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Plin. lib. viii. c.
26.</BIBL></NOTE>. Marcus Scaurus produced them living in his unrivalled
exhi|bitions; and the Romans con&s;idered him as the be&s;t citizen, becau&s;e
he furni&s;hed them with the mo&s;t expen&s;ive entertainments. But
entertain|ment at that corrupt time was their only occu|pation.</P>

<PB N="139" REF="145">
<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Of the Salamander.</HEAD>
<P>THE ancients have de&s;cribed a lizard that is bred from heat,
that lives in the flames, and feeds upon fire as its proper nouri&s;hment. As
they &s;aw every other element, the air, the earth and water, inhabited, fancy
was &s;et to work to find or make an inhabitant in fire; and thus to people
every part of nature. It will be need|le&s;s to &s;ay that there is no &s;uch
animal exi&s;ting; and that, of all others, the modern Salamander has the
&s;malle&s;t affinity to &s;uch an abode.</P>
<P>Whether the animal that now goes by the name of the &s;alamander
be the &s;ame with that de&s;cribed by Pliny, is a doubt with me; but this is
not a place for the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. It is &s;uf|ficient to ob&s;erve, that
the modern &s;alamander is an animal of the lizard kind, and under this name is
comprehended a large tribe that all go by the &s;ame name. There have been not
le&s;s than &s;even &s;orts of this animal de&s;cribed by Seba; and to have
&s;ome idea of the peculiarity of their figure, if we &s;uppo&s;e the tail of a
lizard applied to the body of a frog, we &s;hall not be far from preci&s;ion.
The common lizard is long, &s;mall <PB N="140" REF="146"> and taper; the
&s;alamander, like the frog, has its eyes towards the back of the head; like
the frog, its &s;nout is round and not pointed, and its belly thick and
&s;wolen. The claws of its toes are &s;hort and feeble; its &s;kin rough; and
the tongue, unlike that of the &s;malle&s;t of the lizard kind, in which it is
long and forked, is &s;hort, and adhering to the under jaw.</P>
<P>But it is not in figure that this animal chiefly differs from
the re&s;t of the lizard tribe; for it &s;eems to differ in nature and
conformation. In nature it is unlike, being an heavy, torpid ani|mal; whereas
the lizard tribe are active, re&s;tle&s;s, and ever in motion: in conformation
it is un|like, as the &s;alamander is produced alive from the body of its
parent, and is completely formed the moment of its exclu&s;ion. It differs from
them al&s;o in its general reputation of being ve|nomous; however, no trials
that have been hi|therto made &s;eem to confirm the truth of the report.</P>
<P>Not only this, but many others of the lizard tribe are &s;aid to
have venom; but it were to be wi&s;hed that mankind, for their own happine&s;s,
would examine into the foundation of this re|proach. By that means many of
them, that are now &s;hunned and dete&s;ted, might be found in|offen&s;ive;
their figure, in&s;tead of exciting either <PB N="141" REF="147"> horror or
di&s;gu&s;t, would then only tend to ani|mate the general &s;cene of nature;
and &s;pecu|lation might examine their manners in con|fidence and &s;ecurity.
Certain it is, that all of the lizard kind with which we are acquainted in this
country, are perfectly harmle&s;s; and it is equally true that, for a long
time, till our prejudices were removed, we con&s;idered not only the Newt, but
the Snake and the Blind|worm, as fraught with the mo&s;t de&s;tructive
poi&s;on. At pre&s;ent we have got over the&s;e pre|judices; and, it is
probable, that, if other nations made the &s;ame efforts for information, it
would be found, that the malignity of mo&s;t, if not all, of the lizard tribe,
was only in the imagination.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the Salamander, the whole tribe, from the
Moron to the Gekko, are &s;aid to be venomous to the la&s;t degree; yet, when
experiments have been tried, no arts, no pro|vocations, could excite the&s;e
animals to the rage of biting. They &s;eem timid and inoffen&s;ive, only living
upon worms and in&s;ects; quite de&s;titute of fangs, like the viper; their
teeth are &s;o very &s;mall, that they are hardly able to inflict a wound. But
as the teeth are thus in|capable of offending, the people of the coun|tries
where they are found have recour&s;e to a venomous &s;laver, which, they
&s;uppo&s;e, i&s;&s;ues <PB N="142" REF="148"> from the animal's mouth; they
al&s;o tell us of a venom i&s;&s;uing from the claws: even Linnaeus &s;eems to
acknowledge the fact; but thinks it a probable &s;uppo&s;ition that this venom
may proceed from their urine.</P>
<P>Of all animals, the Gekko is the mo&s;t no|torious for its
powers of mi&s;chief: yet, we are told by tho&s;e who load it with that
calumny, that it is very friendly to man, and though &s;up|plied with the
mo&s;t deadly virulence, is yet never known to bite. It would be ab&s;urd in
us, without experience, to pronounce upon the noxious or inoffen&s;ive
qualities of animals: yet it is mo&s;t probable, from an in&s;pection of the
teeth of lizards, and from their inoffen&s;ive qua|lities in Europe, that the
gekko has been un|ju&s;tly accu&s;ed; and that its &s;erpent-like figure has
involved it in one common reproach with &s;erpents.</P>
<P>The &s;alamander be&s;t known in Europe, is from eight to eleven
inches long, u&s;ually black, &s;potted with yellow; and when taken in the
hand, feeling cold to a great degree. There are &s;everal kinds. Our Black
Water Newt is reckoned among the number. The idle report of its being
incon&s;umable in fire, has cau&s;ed many of the&s;e poor animals to be burnt;
but we cannot &s;ay as philo&s;ophical martyrs; &s;ince &s;carce any 
<PB N="143" REF="149"> philo&s;opher could think it nece&s;&s;ary to make the
experiment. When thrown into the fire, the animal is &s;een to bur&s;t with the
heat of its &s;ituation, and to eject its fluids. We are gravely told, in the
Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, that this is a method the animal takes to
extingui&s;h the flames.</P>
<P>When examined internally, the &s;alamander exhibits little
different from other animals of the lizard kind. It is furni&s;hed with lungs
that &s;ometimes &s;erve for the offices of breathing; with a heart that has
its communications open, &s;o that the animal cannot ea&s;ily be drowned. The
ovary in the female is double the &s;ize of what it is in others of this tribe;
and the male is furni&s;hed with four te&s;ticuli in&s;tead of two. But what
de&s;erves particular notice is the manner of this animal's bringing forth its
young alive<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Acta Hafnien&s;ia. ann. 1676.

<Q REND="inline">"The &s;alamander," &s;ays my author, "begins to
&s;hew it&s;elf in &s;pring, and chiefly during heavy rains. When the warm
weather re|turns, it di&s;appears; and never leaves its hole, during either
great heats or &s;evere colds, both which it equally fears. When taken in the
hand, it appears like a lump of ice; it con&s;equently loves the &s;hade, and
is found <PB N="144" REF="150"> at the feet of old trees &s;urrounded with
bru&s;h|wood at the bottom. It is fond of running along new plowed grounds;
probably to &s;eek for worms, which are its ordinary food. One of the&s;e,"
continues my author, "I took alive &s;ome years ago in a ditch that had been
lately made. I laid it at the foot of the &s;tairs upon coming home, and there
it di&s;gorged from the throat a <HI>worm</HI> three inches long, that lived
for an hour after, though wounded as I &s;uppo&s;e by the teeth of the animal.
I afterwards cut up another of the&s;e lizards, and &s;aw not le&s;s than fifty
young ones, re|&s;embling the parent, come from its womb, all alive, and
actively running about the room."</Q> It were to be wi&s;hed the author had
u&s;ed another word be&s;ide that of <HI>worm</HI>; as we now are in doubt
whether he means a real worm, or a young animal of the lizard &s;pecies: had he
been more explicit, and had it appeared that it was a real young lizard, which
I take to be his meaning, we might here &s;ee a wonder of Nature, brought to
the proof which many have a&s;&s;erted, and many have thought proper to
deny:&mdash;I mean the refuge which the young of the &s;hark, the lizard, and
the viper kinds, are &s;aid to take, by running down the throat of the parent,
and there finding a temporary &s;ecurity. <PB N="145" REF="151"> The fact
indeed, &s;eems a little extraordinary; and yet it is &s;o frequently
atte&s;ted by &s;ome, and even believed by others, who&s;e authority is
re|&s;pectable, among the number of whom we find Mr. Penant, that the argument
of &s;trangene&s;s mu&s;t give way to the weight of authority.</P>
<P>However this be, there is no doubt of the animal's being
viviparous, and producing above fifty at a time. They come from the parent in
full perfection, and quickly leave her to &s;hift for them&s;elves. The&s;e
animals, in the lower ranks of nature, want &s;carce any help when excluded;
they &s;oon complete the little circle of their education; and in a day or two
are capable of practi&s;ing all the arts of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and eva&s;ion
practi&s;ed by their kind.</P>
<P>They are all amphibious, or at lea&s;t are found capable of
&s;ub&s;i&s;ting in either element, when placed there: if tho&s;e taken from
land are put into water, they continue there in &s;eeming health; and, on the
contrary, tho&s;e taken from the water will live upon land. In water, however,
they exhibit a greater variety in their appearance; and what is equally
won|derful with the re&s;t of their hi&s;tory, during the whole &s;pring and
&s;ummer this water lizard changes its &s;kin every fourth or fifth day; and
during the winter every fifteen days. This <PB N="146" REF="152"> operation
they perform by means of the mouth and the claws; and it &s;eems a work of no
&s;mall difficulty and pain. The ca&s;t &s;kins are fre|quently &s;een floating
on the &s;urface of the water: they are &s;ometimes &s;een al&s;o with a part
of their old &s;kin &s;till &s;ticking to one of their limbs, which they have
not been able to get rid of; and thus, like a man with a boot half drawn, in
&s;ome mea&s;ure crippled in their own &s;poils. This al&s;o often corrupts,
and the leg drops off; but the animal does not &s;eem to feel the want of it,
for the lo&s;s of a limb to all the lizard kind is but a trifling calamity.
They can live &s;everal hours even after the lo&s;s of their head: and for
&s;ome time under di&s;&s;ection, all the parts of this animal &s;eem to retain
life: but the tail is the part that longe&s;t retains its motion. Salt &s;eems
to be much more efficacious in de&s;troying the&s;e animals, than the knife;
for, upon being &s;prink|led with it, the whole body emits a vi&s;cous li|quor,
and the lizard dies in three minutes, in great agonies.</P>
<P>The whole of the lizard kind are al&s;o te|nacious of life in
another re&s;pect, and the &s;ala|mander among the number. They &s;u&s;tain the
want of food in a &s;urprizing manner. One of them, brought from the Indies,
lived nine months, without any other food than what it <PB N="147" REF="153">
received from licking a piece of earth on which it was brought over<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Phil. Tran&s;. ann. 1661. N. 21. art. 7.</BIBL></NOTE>:
another was kept by Seba in an empty vial for &s;ix months, with|out any
nouri&s;hment; and Redi talks of a large one, brought from Africa, that lived
for eight months, without taking any nouri&s;h|ment whatever. Indeed, as many
of this kind, both &s;alamanders and lizards, are torpid, or nearly &s;o,
during the winter, the lo&s;s of their appetite for &s;o long a time is the
le&s;s &s;urprizing.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Of the Cameleon, the Iguana, and Lizards of
different Kinds.</HEAD>
<P>IT were to be wi&s;hed that animals could be &s;o cla&s;&s;ed,
that by the very mentioning their rank, we &s;hould receive &s;ome in&s;ight
into their hi&s;tory. This I have endeavoured in mo&s;t in|&s;tances; but in
the pre&s;ent chapter all method is totally un&s;erviceable. Here
di&s;tribution gives no general ideas: for &s;ome of the animals to be here
mentioned produce by eggs; &s;ome by &s;pawn; and &s;ome are viviparous. The
peculiar manner of propagating in each, is very in|di&s;tinctly known. The
Iguana and the Came|leon, we know bring forth eggs; &s;ome others al&s;o
produce in the &s;ame manner: but of the re&s;t, which naturali&s;ts make
amount to above fifty, we have but very indi&s;tinct information.</P>
<P>In the former divi&s;ions of this tribe, we had to ob&s;erve
upon animals, formidable from their &s;ize, or di&s;gu&s;ting from their
frog-like head and appearance; in the pre&s;ent divi&s;ion, all the animals are
either beautiful to the eye, or grateful to the appetite. The lizards, properly
&s;o called, are beautifully painted and mottled; <PB N="149" REF="155"> their
frolic&s;ome agility is amu&s;ing to tho&s;e who are familiar with their
appearance; and the great affection which &s;ome of them &s;hew to man,
&s;hould, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, be repaid with kind|ne&s;s. Others, &s;uch as
the Iguana, though not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of beauty, are very &s;erviceable,
fur|ni&s;hing one of the mo&s;t luxurious fea&s;ts the tropical climates can
boa&s;t of. Tho&s;e treated of before were objects of curio&s;ity, becau&s;e
they were apparently objects of danger: mo&s;t of tho&s;e here mentioned have
either u&s;e or beauty to engage us.</P>
<P>Directly de&s;cending from the crocodile, we find the Cordyle,
the Tockay and the Teju|guacu, all growing le&s;s in order, as I have named
them. The&s;e fill up the cha&s;m to be found between the crocodile and the
African iguana.</P>
<P>The Iguana, which de&s;erves our notice, is about five feet
long, and the body about as thick as one's thigh: the &s;kin is covered with
&s;mall &s;cales, like tho&s;e of a &s;erpent; and the back is furni&s;hed with
a row of prickles, that &s;tand up, like the teeth of a &s;aw: the eyes &s;eem
to be but half opened, except when the animal is angry, and then they appear
large and &s;parkling: both the jaws are full of very &s;harp teeth, and the
bite is dangerous though <PB N="150" REF="156"> not venomous, for it never lets
loo&s;e till it is killed. The male has a &s;kin hanging under his throat,
which reaches down to his brea&s;t; and, when di&s;plea&s;ed, he puffs it up
like a bladder: he is one third larger and &s;tronger than the fe|male; though
the &s;trength of either avails them little towards their defence. The males
are a&s;h-coloured, and the females are green.</P>
<P>The fle&s;h of the&s;e may be con&s;idered as the greate&s;t
delicacy of Africa and America; and the &s;port&s;men of tho&s;e climates go
out to hunt the iguana, as we do in pur&s;uit of the phea&s;ant or the hare. In
the beginning of the &s;ea&s;on, when the great floods of the tropical climates
are pa&s;t away, and vegetation &s;tarts into uni|ver&s;al verdure, the
&s;port&s;men are &s;een, with a nooze and a &s;tick, wandering along the
&s;ides of the rivers, to take the iguana. This animal, though apparently
formed for combat, is the mo&s;t harmle&s;s creature of all the fore&s;t; it
lives among the trees, or &s;ports in the water, without ever offering to
offend: there, having fed upon the flowers of the mahot, and the leaves of the
mapou, that grow along the banks of the &s;tream, it goes to repo&s;e upon the
branches of the trees that hang over the water. Upon land the animal is &s;wift
of foot; but when once in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of a tree, it &s;eems con&s;cious
of the &s;ecu|rity <PB N="151" REF="157"> of its &s;ituation, and never offers
to &s;tir. There the &s;port&s;man ea&s;ily finds it, and as ea&s;ily fa&s;tens
his nooze round its neck: if the head be placed in &s;uch a manner that the
nooze cannot readily be fa&s;tened, by hitting the animal a blow on the no&s;e
with the &s;tick, it lifts the head, and offers it in &s;ome mea&s;ure to the
nooze. In this manner, and al&s;o by the tail, the iguana is dragged from the
trees, and killed by repeat|ed blows on the head.</P>
<P>The Cameleon is a very different animal; and as the iguana
&s;atisfies the appetites of the epicure, this is rather the fea&s;t of the
philo&s;opher. Like the crocodile, this little animal proceeds from an egg; and
it al&s;o nearly re&s;embles that for|midable creature in form: but it differs
widely in its &s;ize and its appetites; being not above eleven inches long, and
delighting to &s;it upon trees, being afraid of &s;erpents, from which it is
unable to e&s;cape on the ground.</P>
<P>The head of a large cameleon is almo&s;t two inches long; and
from thence to the beginning of the tail, four and an half: the tail is five
inches long, and the feet two and an half: the thickne&s;s of the body is
different at different times; for &s;ometimes, from the back to the belly, it
is two inches, and &s;ometimes but one; for it can blow it&s;elf up, and
contract it&s;elf, at <PB N="152" REF="158"> plea&s;ure. This &s;welling and
contraction is not only of the back and belly, but of the legs and tail.</P>
<P>The&s;e different tumours do not proceed from a dilatation of
the brea&s;t in breathing, which ri&s;es and falls by turns; but are very
irregular, and &s;eem adopted merely from caprice. The ca|meleon is often
&s;een, as it were, blown up for two hours together; and then it continues
growing le&s;s and le&s;s in&s;en&s;ibly; for the dilatation is always more
quick and vi&s;ible than the contraction. In this la&s;t &s;tate the animal
ap|pears extremely lean; the &s;pine of the back &s;eems &s;harp, and all the
ribs may be counted; likewi&s;e the tendons of the legs and arms may be &s;een
very di&s;tinctly.</P>
<P>This method of puffing it&s;elf up, is &s;imilar to that in
pigeons, who&s;e crops are &s;ometimes greatly di&s;tended with air. The
cameleon has a power of driving the air it breathes over every part of the
body: however, it only gets between the &s;kin and the mu&s;cles; for the
mu&s;cles them|&s;elves are never &s;wolen. The &s;kin is very cold to the
touch; and though the animal &s;eems &s;o lean, there is no feeling the beating
of the heart. The &s;urface of the &s;kin is unequal, and has a grain not
unlike &s;hagreen, but very &s;oft, be|cau&s;e each eminence is as &s;mooth as
if it were <PB N="153" REF="159"> poli&s;hed. Some of the&s;e little
protuberances are as large as a pin's head, on the arms, legs, belly and tail;
but on the &s;houlders and head they are of an oval figure, and a little
larger: tho&s;e under the throat are ranged in the form of a chaplet, from the
lower lip to the brea&s;t. The colour of all the&s;e eminences, when the
cameleon is at re&s;t in a &s;hady place, is of a blui&s;h grey, and the
&s;paces between is of a pale red and yellow.</P>
<P>But when the animal is removed into the &s;un, then comes the
wonderful part of its hi&s;tory. At fir&s;t it appears to &s;uffer no change of
colour, its greyi&s;h &s;pots &s;till continuing the &s;ame: but the whole
&s;urface &s;oon &s;eems to imbibe the rays of light; and the &s;imple
colouring of the body changes into a variety of beautiful hues. Wherever the
light comes upon the body, it is of a tawny brown; but that part of the &s;kin
on which the &s;un does not &s;hine, changes into &s;e|veral brighter colours,
pale yellow, or vivid crim&s;on; which form &s;pots of the &s;ize of half one's
finger: &s;ome of the&s;e de&s;cend from the &s;pine half way down the back;
and others appear on the &s;ides, arms and tail. When the &s;un has done
&s;hining, the original grey colour returns by degrees, and covers all the
body. Sometimes the animal becomes all over <PB N="154" REF="160"> &s;potted
with brown &s;pots, of a greeni&s;h ca&s;t. When it is wrapped up in a white
linen cloth for two or three minutes, the natural colour becomes much lighter;
but not quite white, as &s;ome authors have pretended: however, from hence it
mu&s;t not be concluded that the ca|meleon a&s;&s;umes the colour of the
objects which it approaches; this is entirely an error, and pro|bably has taken
its ri&s;e from the continual changes it appears to undergo.</P>
<P>Le Bruyn, in his Voyage to the Levant, has given us a very ample
de&s;cription of the came|leon. During his &s;tay at Smyrna, he bought
&s;everal of this kind, and, to try how long they could live, kept four of them
in a cage, per|mitting them at times to run about the hou&s;e. The fre&s;h
&s;ea-breeze &s;eemed to give them mo&s;t &s;pirits and vivacity; they opened
their mouths to take it in: he never perceived that they eat any thing, except
now and then a fly, which they took half an hour to &s;wallow: he ob&s;erved
their colour often to change, three or four times &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, without
being able to find out any cau&s;e for &s;uch alterations: their common colour
he found to be grey, or rather a pale mou&s;e colour; but its mo&s;t frequent
changes were into a beautiful green, &s;potted with yellow: &s;ome|times the
animal was marked all over with dark <PB N="155" REF="161"> brown; and this
often changed into a lighter brown: &s;ome colours, however, it never
a&s;|&s;umed; and, contrary to what was &s;aid above, he found red to be among
the number.</P>
<P>Though our traveller took the utmo&s;t care, he was unable to
pre&s;erve any of them alive above five months; and many of them died in four.
When the cameleon changes place, and attempts to de&s;cend from an eminence, it
moves with the utmo&s;t precaution, advancing one leg very deliberately before
the other, &s;till &s;ecuring it&s;elf by holding whatever it can gra&s;p by
the tail. It &s;eldom opens the mouth, except for fre&s;h air; and when that is
&s;upplied, di&s;covers its &s;atisfaction by its motions, and the frequent
changes of its colour. The tongue is &s;ometimes darted out after its prey,
which is flies; and this is as long as the whole body. The eyes are remarkably
little, though they &s;tand out of the head: they have a &s;ingle eye-lid, like
a cap with a hole in the middle, through which the &s;ight of the eye appears,
which is of a &s;hining brown; and round it there is a little circle of a gold
colour: but the mo&s;t extraordinary part of their conformation is, that the
animal often moves one eye, when the other is entirely at re&s;t; nay,
&s;ometimes one eye will &s;eem to look directly forward, while the other looks
back|ward; <PB N="156" REF="162"> and one will look upwards, while the other
regards the earth.</P>
<P>To this cla&s;s of lizards, we may refer the Dragon, a mo&s;t
terrible animal, but mo&s;t pro|bably not of Nature's formation. Of this
death-dealing creature all people have read; and the mo&s;t barbarous
countries, to this day, paint it to the imagination in all its terrors, and
fear to meet it in every fore&s;t. It is not enough that Nature has furni&s;hed
tho&s;e countries with poi|&s;ons of various malignity; with &s;erpents forty
feet long; with elephants, lions and tigers, to make their &s;ituation really
dangerous; the ca|pricious imagination is &s;et at work to call up new terrors;
and &s;carce a &s;avage is found, that does not talk of winged &s;erpents of
immoderate length, flying away with the camel or the rhino|ceros, or
de&s;troying mankind by a &s;ingle glare. Happily, however, &s;uch ravagers are
no where found to exi&s;t at pre&s;ent; and the whole race of dragons is
dwindled down to the Flying Lizard, a little harmle&s;s creature, that only
preys upon in&s;ects, and even &s;eems to embelli&s;h the fore&s;t with its
beauty.</P>
<P>The Flying Lizard of Java perches upon fruit-trees, and feeds
upon flies, ants, but|terflies, and other &s;mall in&s;ects. It is a very
harmle&s;s creature, and does no mi&s;chief in <PB N="157" REF="163"> any
re&s;pect. Gentil, in his Voyage round the World, affirms, that he has &s;een
the&s;e lizards, at the i&s;land of Java, in the Ea&s;t Indies. He ob&s;erved
they flew very &s;wiftly from tree to tree; and having killed one, he could not
but admire the &s;kin, which was painted with &s;everal beautiful colours: it
was a foot in length, and had four paws, like the common lizards; but its head
was flat, and had a &s;mall hole in the middle; the wings were very thin, and
re&s;embled tho&s;e of a flying fi&s;h. About the neck were a &s;ort of
wattles, not unlike tho&s;e of cocks, which gave it no di&s;agreeable
appearance. He intended to have pre&s;erved it, in order to bring it into
Europe; but it was corrupted by the heat, before the clo&s;e of the day:
however, they have &s;ince been brought into England, and are now com|mon
enough in the cabinets of the curious.</P>
<P>The la&s;t animal of the lizard kind that I &s;hall mention, is
the Chalcidian Lizard of Aldro|vandus, very improperly called the Seps, by
modern hi&s;torians. This animal &s;eems to make the &s;hade that &s;eparates
the lizard from the &s;erpent race. It has four legs, like the lizard; but &s;o
&s;hort, as to be utterly un&s;erviceable in walking: it has a long &s;lender
body, like the &s;erpent; and it is &s;aid to have the &s;erpent's ma|lignity
al&s;o. The fore legs are very near the <PB N="158" REF="164"> head; the hind
legs are placed far backward; but before and behind they &s;eem rather
u&s;ele&s;s incumbrances, than in&s;truments &s;erving to a&s;&s;i&s;t the
animal in its motions, or in providing for its &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The&s;e
animals are found above three feet long, and thick in proportion, with a large
head and pointed &s;nout. The whole body is covered with &s;cales; and the
belly is white, mixed with blue. It has four crooked teeth; as al&s;o a pointed
tail, which, however, can inflict no wound. Whether the teeth be &s;imilar to
the viper's fangs, we are not told; though Volateranus &s;ays, they are covered
with a membrane; by which I am apt to think he means a venom-bag, which is
found at the root of the teeth of all &s;erpents that are poi|&s;onous. It is
viviparous; fifteen young ones having been taken alive out of its belly. Upon
the whole, it appears to bear a &s;trong affinity to the viper; and, like that
animal, its bite may be dangerous.</P>

<PB N="159" REF="165">
<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. Of Serpents in General.</HEAD>
<P>WE now come to a tribe that not only their deformity, their
venom, their ready malignity, but al&s;o our prejudices, and our very religion,
have taught us to dete&s;t. The &s;erpent has from the beginning been the enemy
of man; and it has hitherto continued to terrify and annoy him,
notwith&s;tanding all the arts which have been practi&s;ed to de&s;troy it.
Formidable in it&s;elf, it deters the invader from the pur&s;uit; and from its
figure capable of finding &s;helter in a little &s;pace, it is not ea&s;ily
di&s;covered by tho&s;e who would venture to try the encounter. Thus
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at once of potent arms and inacce&s;&s;ible or &s;ecure
retreats, it baffles all the arts of man though never &s;o earne&s;tly bent
upon its de|&s;truction.</P>
<P>For this rea&s;on, there is &s;carce a country in the world that
does not &s;till give birth to this poi&s;onous brood, that &s;eem formed to
quell human pride, and repre&s;s the boa&s;ts of &s;ecurity. Mankind have
driven the lion, the tiger and the wolf from their vicinity; but the &s;nake
and the viper &s;till defy their power, and frequently puni&s;h their
in&s;olence.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="166">Their numbers, however, are thinned by
human a&s;&s;iduity; and it is po&s;&s;ible &s;ome of the kinds are wholly
de&s;troyed. In none of the countries of Europe are they &s;ufficiently
nume|rous to be truly terrible; the philo&s;opher can meditate in the fields
without danger, and the lover &s;eek the grove without fearing any wounds but
tho&s;e of metaphor. The various malignity that has been a&s;cribed to European
&s;erpents of old, is now utterly unknown; there are not above three or four
kinds that are dangerous, and their poi&s;on operates in all in the &s;ame
manner. A burning pain in the part, ea&s;ily re|movable by timely applications,
is the wor&s;t effect that we experience from the bite of the mo&s;t venomous
&s;erpents of Europe. The drow&s;y death, the &s;tarting of the blood from
every pore, the in&s;atiable and burning thir&s;t, the melting down the &s;olid
ma&s;s of the whole form into one heap of putrefaction, the&s;e are horrors
with which we are entirely unacquainted.</P>
<P>But though we have thus reduced the&s;e dan|gers, having been
incapable of wholly remov|ing them, in other parts of the world they &s;till
rage with all their ancient malignity. Nature &s;eems to have placed them as
centinels to deter mankind from &s;preading too widely, and from &s;eeking new
abodes till they have thoroughly <PB N="161" REF="167"> cultivated tho&s;e at
home. In the warm coun|tries that lie within the tropic, as well as in the cold
regions of the north, where the inhabitants are few, the &s;erpents propagate
in equal pro|portion. But of all countries, tho&s;e regions have them in the
greate&s;t abundance where the fields are unpeopled and fertile, and where the
climate &s;upplies warmth and humidity. All along the &s;wampy banks of the
river Niger or Oroonoko, where the &s;un is hot, the fore&s;ts thick, and the
men but few, the &s;erpents cling among the branches of the trees in infinite
num|bers, and carry on an uncea&s;ing war again&s;t all other animals in their
vicinity. Travellers have a&s;&s;ured us that they have often &s;een large
&s;nakes twining round the trunk of a tall tree, encom|pa&s;&s;ing it like a
wreath, and thus ri&s;ing and de|&s;cending at plea&s;ure. In the&s;e
countries, there|fore, the &s;erpent is too formidable to become an object of
curio&s;ity, for it excites much more violent &s;en&s;ations.</P>
<P>We are not, therefore, to reject as wholly fa|bulous, the
accounts left us by the ancients of the terrible deva&s;tations committed by a
&s;ingle &s;er|pent. It is probable, in early times, when the arts were little
known, and mankind were but thinly &s;cattered over the earth, that &s;erpents,
conti|nuing undi&s;turbed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the fore&s;t, grew 
<PB N="162" REF="168"> to an amazing magnitude; and every other tribe of
animals fell before them. It then might have happened, that &s;erpents reigned
the tyrants of a di&s;trict for centuries together. To animals of this kind,
grown by time and rapacity to an hundred or an hundred and fifty feet in
length, the lion, the tiger, and even the elephant it&s;elf, were but feeble
opponents. The dreadful mon|&s;ter &s;pread de&s;olation round him; every
creature that had life was devoured, or fled to a di&s;tance. That horrible
<HI>faetor</HI> which even the commone&s;t and the mo&s;t harmle&s;s &s;nakes
are &s;till found to diffu&s;e, might, in the&s;e larger ones, become too
powerful for any living being to with&s;tand; and while they preyed without
di&s;tinction, they might thus al&s;o have poi&s;oned the atmo&s;phere around
them. In this manner, having for ages lived in the hidden and unpeopled
fore&s;t, and finding, as their appetites were more powerful, the quantity of
their prey decrea&s;ing, it is po&s;&s;ible they might venture boldly from
their retreats, into the more cultivated parts of the country, and carry
con&s;ternation among mankind, as they had before de&s;olation among the lower
ranks of nature. We have many hi&s;tories of antiquity, pre&s;enting us &s;uch
a picture; and exhibiting a whole nation &s;inking under the ravages of a
&s;ingle &s;erpent. At that time man had not learned the art of uniting the
efforts of <PB N="163" REF="169"> many, to effect one great purpo&s;e.
Oppo&s;ing multitudes only added new victims to the ge|neral calamity, and
encrea&s;ed mutual embar|ra&s;&s;ment and terror. The animal was therefore to
be &s;ingly oppo&s;ed by him who had the greate&s;t &s;trength, the be&s;t
armour, and the mo&s;t un|daunted courage. In &s;uch an encounter, hun|dreds
mu&s;t have fallen; till one, more lucky than the re&s;t, by a fortunate blow,
or by taking the mon&s;ter in its torpid interval, and &s;urcharged with
&s;poil, might kill, and thus rid his country of the de&s;troyer. Such was the
original oc|cupation of heroes; and tho&s;e who fir&s;t obtained that name,
from their de&s;troying the ravagers of the earth, gained it much more
de&s;ervedly than their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, who acquired their repu|tation only
for their &s;kill in de&s;troying each other. But as we de&s;cend into more
enlightened anti|quity, we find the&s;e animals le&s;s formidable, as being
attacked in a more &s;ucce&s;sful manner. We are told, that while Regulus led
his army along the banks of the river Bagrada in Africa, an enormous &s;erpent
di&s;puted his pa&s;&s;age over. We are a&s;&s;ured by Pliny, who &s;ays that
he him&s;elf &s;aw the &s;kin, that it was an hundred and twenty feet long, and
that it had de&s;troyed many of the army. At la&s;t, however, the battering
engines were brought out again&s;t it; and the&s;e a&s;&s;ailing 
<PB N="164" REF="170"> it at a di&s;tance, it was &s;oon de&s;troyed. Its
&s;poils were carried to Rome, and the general was de|creed an ovation for his
&s;ucce&s;s. There are, perhaps, few facts better a&s;certained in hi&s;tory
than this: an ovation was a remarkable honour; and was given only for &s;ome
&s;ignal exploit, that did not de&s;erve a triumph: no hi&s;torian would offer
to invent that part of the &s;tory at lea&s;t, without being &s;ubject to the
mo&s;t &s;hameful de|tection. The &s;kin was kept for &s;everal years after in
the Capitol; and Pliny &s;ays, he &s;aw it there: now, though Pliny was a
credulous writer, he was by no means a <HI>fal&s;e</HI> one; and whatever he
&s;ays he has &s;een, we may very &s;afely rely on. At pre&s;ent, indeed,
&s;uch ravages from &s;erpents are &s;carce &s;een in any part of the world;
not but that in Africa and America, &s;ome of them are powerful enough to brave
the a&s;&s;aults of men to this day.</P>
<P>But happily for us, we are placed at &s;uch a di&s;tance as to
take a view of this tribe, without fearing for our &s;afety; we can &s;urvey
their impo|tent malignity with the &s;ame delight with which the poet
de&s;cribes the terrors of a dead mon&s;ter. 
<Q> 
<L>Nequeunt expleri corda tuendo</L> 
<L>Terribles occulos villo&s;aque &s;etis pectore.</L></Q> To
us their &s;lender form, their undulating motion, their vivid colouring, their
horrid &s;tench, their forky tongue, and their envenomed <PB N="165" REF="171">
fangs, are totally harmle&s;s; and in this country their u&s;es even &s;erve to
counterbalance the mi&s;|chief they &s;ometimes occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>If we take a &s;urvey of &s;erpents in general, they have marks
by which they are di&s;tingui&s;hed from all the re&s;t of animated nature.
They have the length and the &s;upplene&s;s of the eel, but want fins to &s;wim
with; they have the &s;caly covering and pointed tail of the lizard, but they
want legs to walk with; they have the crawling motion of the worm, but, unlike
that animal, they have lungs to breathe with: like all the reptile kind, they
are re&s;entful when of|fended; and Nature has &s;upplied them with terrible
arms to revenge every injury.</P>
<P>Though they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of very different degrees of
malignity, yet they are all formidable to man, and have a &s;trong &s;imilitude
of form to each other; and it will be proper to mark the general characters
before we de&s;cend to par|ticulars. With re&s;pect to their conformation, all
&s;erpents have a very wide mouth, in pro|portion to the &s;ize of the head;
and what is very extraordinary, they can gape and &s;wallow the head of another
animal which is three times as big as their own. I have &s;een a toad taken out
of the belly of a &s;nake, at Lord Spencer's, near London, the body of which
was thrice the <PB N="166" REF="172"> diameter of the animal that &s;wallowed
it. How|ever, it is no way &s;urprizing that the &s;kin of the &s;nake &s;hould
&s;tretch to receive &s;o large a mor&s;el; the wonder &s;eems how the jaws
could take it in. To explain this, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved that the jaws of
this animal do not open as ours, in the manner of a pair of hinges, where bones
are applied to bones and play upon one another; on the contrary, the
&s;erpent's jaws are held together at the roots by a &s;tretching mu&s;cular
&s;kin; by which means they open as widely as the animal chu&s;es to &s;tretch
them, and admit of a prey much thicker than the &s;nake's own body. The throat,
like &s;tretching leather, dilates to admit the mor&s;el; the &s;tomach
receives it in part; and the re&s;t remains in the gullet, till putrefac|tion
and the juices of the &s;erpent's body unite to di&s;&s;olve it.</P>
<P>As to the teeth, I will talk more of them when I come to treat
of the viper's poi&s;on; it will be &s;ufficient here to ob&s;erve, that &s;ome
&s;erpents have fangs, or canine teeth, and others are without them. The teeth
in all are crooked and hollow; and, by a peculiar contrivance, are capable of
being erected or depre&s;&s;ed at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The eyes of all &s;erpents are &s;mall, if compared to the
length of the body; and though dif|ferently coloured in different kinds, yet
the <PB N="167" REF="173"> appearance of all is malign and heavy; and from
their known qualities, they &s;trike the imagination with the idea of a
creature me|ditating mi&s;chief. In &s;ome, the upper eye-lid is wanting, and
the &s;erpent winks only with that below; in others, the animal has a
nicti|tating membrane or &s;kin, re&s;embling that which is found in birds,
which keeps the eye clean and pre&s;erves the &s;ight. The &s;ub&s;tance of the
eye in all is hard and horny; the chry|&s;taline humour occupying a great part
of the globe.</P>
<P>The holes for hearing are very vi&s;ible in all: but there are
no conduits for &s;melling; though it is probable that &s;ome of them enjoy
that &s;en&s;e in tolerable perfection.</P>
<P>The tongue in all the&s;e animals is long and forky. It is
compo&s;ed of two long fle&s;hy &s;ub|&s;tances, which terminate in &s;harp
points, and are very pliable. At the root it is connected very &s;trongly to
the neck by two tendons, that give it a variety of play. Some of the viper kind
have tongues a fifth part of the length of their bodies; they are continually
darting them out, but they are entirely harmle&s;s, and only terrify tho&s;e
who are ignorant of the real &s;itua|tion of their poi&s;on.</P>
<P>If from the jaws we go on to the gullet, we 
<PB N="168" REF="174"> &s;hall find it very wide for the animal's &s;ize, and
capable of being di&s;tended to a great degree; at the bottom of this lies the
&s;tomach, which is not &s;o capacious, and receives only a part of the prey,
while the re&s;t continues in the gullet for dige&s;tion. When the
&s;ub&s;tance in the &s;to|mach is di&s;&s;olved into chyle, it pa&s;&s;es into
the inte&s;tines, and from thence goes to nouri&s;hment, or to be excluded by
the vent.</P>
<P>Like mo&s;t other animals, &s;erpents are fur|ni&s;hed with
lungs, which I &s;uppo&s;e are &s;ervice|able in breathing, though we cannot
perceive the manner in which this operation is per|formed; for though
&s;erpents are often &s;een ap|parently to draw in their breath, yet we cannot
find the &s;malle&s;t &s;igns of their ever re&s;piring it again. Their lungs
however are long and large, and doubtle&s;s are nece&s;&s;ary to promote their
languid circulation. The heart is formed as in the tortoi&s;e, the frog, and
the lizard kinds, &s;o as to work without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the lungs. It
is &s;ingle, the greate&s;t part of the blood flowing from the great vein to
the great artery by the &s;horte&s;t cour&s;e. By this contrivance of Nature we
ea&s;ily gather two con&s;equences; that &s;nakes are amphibious, being equally
capable of living on land and in the water; and, that al&s;o they are torpid in
winter, like the bat, the <PB N="169" REF="175"> lizard, and other animals
formed in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>The vent in the&s;e animals &s;erves for the emi&s;&s;ion of the
urine and the faeces, and for the purpo&s;es of generation. The in&s;trument of
generation in the male is double, being forked like the tongue; the ovaries in
the female are double al&s;o; and the aperture is very large, in order to
receive the double in&s;trument of the male. They copulate in their retreats;
and it is &s;aid by the ancients, that in this &s;ituation they appear like one
&s;erpent with two heads; but how far this remark is founded in truth, I do not
find any of the moderns that can re&s;olve me.</P>
<P>As the body of this animal is long, &s;lender, and capable of
bending in every direction, the number of joints in the back-bone are numerous
beyond what one would imagine. In the gene|rality of quadrupedes, they amount
to not above thirty or forty; in the &s;erpent kind they amount to an hundred
and forty-five from the head to the vent, and twenty-five more from that to the
tail<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Vide Charat. Anatom.</BIBL></NOTE>. The
number of the&s;e joints mu&s;t give the back-bone a &s;urprizing degree of
pliancy; but this is &s;till encrea&s;ed by the manner in which each of the&s;e
joints are locked into the <PB N="170" REF="176"> other. In man and
quadrupedes, the flat &s;ur|faces of the bones are laid one again&s;t the
other, and bound tight by &s;inews; but in &s;erpents the bones play one within
the other like ball and &s;ocket, &s;o that they have full motion upon each
other in every direction<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Derham, p.
396.</BIBL></NOTE>. Thus if a man were to form a machine compo&s;ed of &s;o
many joints as are found in the back of a &s;erpent, he would find it no ea&s;y
matter to give it &s;uch &s;trength and pliancy at the &s;ame time. The chain
of a watch is but a bungling piece of workman&s;hip in compari&s;on.</P>
<P>Though the number of joints in the back|bone is great, yet that
of the ribs is &s;till greater; for, from the head to the vent, there are two
ribs to every joint, which makes their number two hundred and ninety in all.
The&s;e ribs are furni&s;hed with mu&s;cles; four in number; which being
in&s;erted into the head, run along to the end of the tail, and give the animal
great &s;trength and agility in all its motions.</P>
<P>The &s;kin al&s;o contributes to its motions, being compo&s;ed
of a number of &s;cales, united to each other by a tran&s;parent membrane,
which grows harder as it grows older, until the animal changes, which is
generally done twice a year. This cover then bur&s;ts near the head, and the
&s;erpent <PB N="171" REF="177"> creeps from it, by an undulatory motion, in a
new &s;kin, much more vivid than the former. If the old &s;lough be then
viewed, every &s;cale will be di&s;tinctly &s;een, like a piece of net-work,
and will be found greate&s;t where the part of the body they covered was
large&s;t.</P>
<P>There is much geometrical neatne&s;s in the di&s;po&s;al of the
&s;erpent's &s;cales, for a&s;&s;i&s;ting the animal's &s;inuous motion. As the
edges of the foremo&s;t &s;cales lie over the ends of their following &s;cales,
&s;o tho&s;e edges, when the &s;cales are erected, which the animal has a power
of doing in a &s;mall degree, catch in the ground, like the nails in the wheel
of a chariot, and &s;o promote and facilitate the animal's progre&s;&s;ive
motion. The erecting the&s;e &s;cales is by means of a multitude of di&s;tinct
mu&s;cles, with which each is &s;upplied, and one end of which is tacked each
to the middle of the foregoing.</P>
<P>In &s;ome of the &s;erpent kind there is the ex|acte&s;t
&s;ymmetry in the&s;e &s;cales; in others they are di&s;po&s;ed more
irregularly. In &s;ome there are larger &s;cales on the belly, and often
an|&s;wering to the number of ribs; in others, how|ever, the animal is without
them. Upon this &s;light difference, Linnaeus has founded his di|&s;tinctions
of the various cla&s;&s;es of the &s;erpent tribe. Human curio&s;ity, however,
and even human in|tere&s;t, <PB N="172" REF="178"> &s;eem to plead for a very
different method of di&s;tribution. It is not the number of &s;cales on a
formidable animal's belly, nor their mag|nitude or variety, that any way excite
our con|cern. The fir&s;t que&s;tion that every man will naturally a&s;k, when
he hears of a &s;nake, is, whether it be large: the &s;econd, whether it be
venomous? In other words, the &s;tronge&s;t lines in the animal's hi&s;tory are
tho&s;e that fir&s;t excite our attention; and the&s;e it is every
hi&s;torian's bu&s;ine&s;s to di&s;play.</P>
<P>When we come to compare &s;erpents with each other, the fir&s;t
great di&s;tinction appears in their &s;ize; no other tribe of animals
differing &s;o widely in this particular. What, for in&s;tance, can be &s;o
remotely &s;eparated as the Great Ly|boija of Surinam, that grows to
thirty-&s;ix feet long; and the Little Serpent, at the Cape of Good Hope and
the north of the river Senegal, that is not above three inches, and covers
whole &s;andy de&s;arts with its multitudes! This tribe of animals, like that
of fi&s;hes, &s;eems to have no bounds put to their growth: their bones are in
great mea&s;ure cartilaginous, and they are con|&s;equently capable of great
exten&s;ion; the older, therefore, a &s;erpent becomes, the larger it grows;
and as they &s;eem to live to a great age, they arrive at an enormous
&s;ize.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="179">Leguat a&s;&s;ures us, that he &s;aw one
in Java, that was fifty feet long. Carli mentions their growing to above forty
feet; and we have now the &s;kin of one in the Mu&s;aeum, that mea&s;ures
thirty-two. Mr. Wentworth, who had large concerns in the Brebices in America,
a&s;&s;ures me, that, in that country, they grow to an enormous length. He one
day &s;ent out a &s;ol|dier, with an Indian, to kill wild fowl for the table;
and they accordingly went &s;ome miles from the fort: in pur&s;uing their game,
the In|dian, who generally marched before, beginning to tire, went to re&s;t
him&s;elf upon the fallen trunk of a tree, as he &s;uppo&s;ed it to be; but
when he was ju&s;t going to &s;it down, the enor|mous mon&s;ter began to move,
and the poor &s;avage perceiving that he had approached a Li|boya, the
greate&s;t of all the &s;erpent kind, dropped down in an agony. The &s;oldier,
who perceived at &s;ome di&s;tance what had hap|pened, levelled at the
&s;erpents head, and, by a lucky aim, &s;hot it dead: however he con|tinued his
fire until he was a&s;&s;ured that the ani|mal was killed; and then going up to
re&s;cue his companion, who was fallen motionle&s;s by its &s;ide, he, to his
a&s;toni&s;hment, found him dead likewi&s;e, being killed by the fright. Upon
his return to the fort, and telling what had hap|pened, <PB N="174" REF="180">
Mr. Wentworth ordered the animal to be brought up, when it was mea&s;ured, and
found to be thirty-&s;ix feet long. He had the &s;kin &s;tuffed, and then
&s;ent to Europe, as a pre|&s;ent to the Prince of Orange, in who&s;e cabinet
it is now to be &s;een at the Hague; but the &s;kin has &s;hrunk, by drying,
two or three feet.</P>
<P>In the Ea&s;t Indies they grow al&s;o to an enormous &s;ize;
particularly in the I&s;land of Java, where, we are a&s;&s;ured, that one of
them will de&s;troy and devour a buffalo. In a letter, printed in the German
Ephemerides, we have an account of a combat between an enormous &s;erpent and a
buffalo, by a per&s;on, who a&s;&s;ures us, that he was him&s;elf a
&s;pectator. The &s;er|pent had for &s;ome time been waiting near the brink of
a pool, in expectation of its prey; when a buffalo was the fir&s;t that
offered. Hav|ing darted upon the affrighted animal, it in|&s;tantly began to
wrap it round with its volu|minous twi&s;tings; and at every twi&s;t the bones
of the buffalo were heard to crack almo&s;t as loud as the report of a cannon.
It was in vain that the poor animal &s;truggled and bellowed; its enormous
enemy entwined it too clo&s;ely to get free; till at length, all its bones
being ma&s;hed to pieces, like tho&s;e of a malefactor on the wheel, and the
whole body reduced to one <PB N="175" REF="181"> uniform ma&s;s, the &s;erpent
untwined its folds to &s;wallow its prey at lei&s;ure. To prepare for this, and
in order to make the body &s;lip down the throat more glibly, it was &s;een to
lick the whole body over, and thus cover it with its mucous. It then began to
&s;wallow it at that end that offered lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance; while its length
of body was dilated to receive its prey, and thus took in at once a mor&s;el
that was three times its own thickne&s;s. We are a&s;&s;ured by travellers,
that the&s;e animals are often found with the body of a &s;tag in their gullet,
while the horns, which they are unable to &s;wallow, keep &s;ticking out at
their mouths.</P>
<P>But it is happy for mankind that the rapacity of the&s;e
frightful creatures is often their puni&s;h|ment; for whenever any of the
&s;erpent kind have gorged them&s;elves in this manner, when|ever their body is
&s;een particularly di&s;tended with food, they then become torpid, and may be
approached and de&s;troyed with &s;afety. Pa|tient of hunger to a &s;urprizing
degree, when|ever they &s;eize and &s;wallow their prey, they &s;eem, like
&s;urfeited gluttons, unwieldy, &s;tupid, helple&s;s, and &s;leepy: they at
that time &s;eek &s;ome retreat, where they may lurk for &s;everal days
together, and dige&s;t their meal in &s;afety: the &s;malle&s;t effort at that
time is capable of de|&s;troying them; they can &s;carce make any
re&s;i&s;t|ance; <PB N="176" REF="182"> and they are equally unqualified for
flight or oppo&s;ition: that is the happy opportunity of attacking them with
&s;ucce&s;s; at that time the naked Indian him&s;elf does not fear to
a&s;&s;ail them. But it is otherwi&s;e when this &s;leepy in|terval of
dige&s;tion is over; they then i&s;&s;ue, with fami&s;hed appetites, from their
retreats, and with accumulated terrors, while every ani|mal of the fore&s;t
flies before them.</P>
<P>Carli de&s;cribes the Long Serpent of Congo, making its track
through the tall gra&s;s, like mowers in a &s;ummer's day. He could not
with|out terror behold whole lines of gra&s;s lying le|velled under the &s;weep
of its tail. In this man|ner it moved forward with great rapidity, until it
found a proper &s;ituation frequented by its prey: there it continued to lurk,
in patient ex|pectation, and would have remained for weeks together, had it not
been di&s;turbed by the natives.</P>
<P>Other creatures have a choice in their pro|vi&s;ion; but the
&s;erpent indi&s;criminately preys upon all; the buffalo, the tiger, and the
gazelle. One would think that the porcupine's quills might be &s;ufficient to
protect it; but whatever has life, &s;erves to appea&s;e the hunger of the&s;e
devouring creatures: porcupines, with all their quills, have frequently been
found in their &s;to|machs, when killed and opened; nay, they mo&s;t frequently
are &s;een to devour each other.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="183">A life of &s;avage ho&s;tility in the
fore&s;t, offers the imagination one of the mo&s;t tremendous pictures in
nature. In tho&s;e burning countries, where the &s;un dries up every brook for
hundreds of miles round; when what had the appearance of a great river in the
rainy &s;ea&s;on, becomes, in &s;ummer, one dreary bed of &s;and; in tho&s;e
countries, I &s;ay, a lake that is never dry, or a brook that is perennial, is
con&s;idered by every animal as the greate&s;t convenience of nature. As to
food, the luxuriant land&s;cape &s;upplies that in &s;ufficient abundance: it
is the want of water that all animals endeavour to remove; and inwardly parched
by the heat of the cli|mate, traver&s;e whole de&s;arts to find out a &s;pring.
When they have di&s;covered this, no dangers can deter them from attempting to
&s;lake their thir&s;t. Thus the neighbourhood of a rivulet, in the heart of
the tropical continents, is generally the place where all the ho&s;tile tribes
of nature draw up for the engagement. On the banks of this little envied
&s;pot, thou&s;ands of animals of va|rious kinds are &s;een venturing to quench
their thir&s;t, or preparing to &s;eize their prey. The elephants are perceived
in a long line, marching from the darker parts of the fore&s;t; the buffalos
are there, depending upon numbers for &s;ecurity; the gazells relying &s;olely
upon their &s;wiftne&s;s; <PB N="178" REF="184"> the lion and tiger waiting a
proper opportunity to &s;eize; but chiefly the larger &s;erpents are upon guard
there, and defend the acce&s;&s;es of the lake. Not an hour pa&s;&s;es without
&s;ome dread|ful combat; but the &s;erpent, defended by its &s;cales, and
naturally capable of &s;u&s;taining a multitude of wounds, is, of all others,
the mo&s;t formidable. It is the mo&s;t wakeful al&s;o; for the whole tribe
&s;leep with their eyes open, and are con&s;equently for ever upon the watch:
&s;o that, till their rapacity is &s;atisfied, few other animals will venture
to approach their &s;tation.</P>
<P>But though the&s;e animals are, of all others, the mo&s;t
voracious, and though the mor&s;el which they &s;wallow without chewing, is
greater than what any other creature, either by land or water, the whale
it&s;elf not excepted, can devour, yet no animals upon earth bear ab&s;tinence
&s;o long as they. A &s;ingle meal, with many of the &s;nake kind, &s;eems to
be the adventure of a &s;ea|&s;on; it is an occurrence for which they have been
for weeks, nay &s;ometimes for months, in pa|tient expectation of. When they
have &s;eized their prey, their indu&s;try for &s;everal weeks is entirely
di&s;continued; the fortunate capture of an hour, often &s;atisfies them for
the remaining period of their annual activity. As their blood is colder than
that of mo&s;t other terre&s;tial ani|mals, and as it circulates but &s;lowly
through <PB N="179" REF="185"> their bodies, &s;o their powers of dige&s;tion
are but feeble. Their prey continues, for a long time, partly in the &s;tomach,
partly in the gullet; and is often &s;een a part hanging out of the mouth. In
this manner it dige&s;ts by degrees; and in proportion as the part below is
di&s;&s;olved, the part above is taken in. It is not therefore till this
tedious operation is entirely performed, that the &s;erpent renews its appetite
and its activity. But &s;hould any accident prevent it from i&s;&s;uing once
more from its cell, it &s;till can continue to bear famine, for weeks, months,
nay for years together. Vipers are often kept in boxes for &s;ix or eight
months, without any food whatever; and there are little &s;erpents &s;ometimes
&s;ent over to Europe, from Grand Cairo, the name of which I have not been able
to learn, that live for &s;everal years in gla&s;&s;es, and never eat at all,
nor even &s;tain the gla&s;s with their excrements. Thus the &s;erpent tribe
unite in them&s;elves two very oppo&s;ite qualities; won|derful ab&s;tinence,
and yet incredible rapacity.</P>
<P>If leaving the con&s;ideration of their appetites, we come to
compare &s;erpents as to their voices, &s;ome are found &s;ilent, &s;ome have a
peculiar cry, but hi&s;&s;ing is the &s;ound which they mo&s;t com|monly &s;end
forth, either as a call to their kind, or as a threat to their enemies. In the
countries <PB N="180" REF="186"> where they abound, they are generally &s;ilent
in the middle of the day, when they are obliged to retire from the heat of the
climate; but as the cool of the evening approaches, they are then heard
i&s;&s;uing from their cells, with con|tinued hi&s;&s;ings; and &s;uch is the
variety of their notes, that &s;ome have a&s;&s;ured me they very much
re&s;emble the mu&s;ic of an Engli&s;h grove. This, &s;ome will hardly credit:
at any rate, &s;uch notes, however plea&s;ing, can give but very little
de|light, when we call to mind the malignity of the min&s;trel. If con&s;idered
indeed, as they an&s;wer the animal's own occa&s;ions, they will be found well
adapted to its nature, and fully an|&s;wering the purpo&s;es of terrifying
&s;uch as would venture to offend it.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to motion, &s;ome &s;erpents, par|ticularly
tho&s;e of the viper kind, move &s;lowly; while others, &s;uch as the
Ammodytes, dart with amazing &s;wiftne&s;s. The motion in all is &s;imilar; but
the &s;trength of body in &s;ome gives a very different appearance. The viper,
that is but a &s;low, feeble-bodied animal, makes way in a heavy undulating
manner; advancing its head, then drawing up its tail behind, and bending the
body into a bow; then from the &s;pot where the head and tail were united,
advancing the head forward as before. This, which is the <PB N="181" REF="187">
motion of all &s;erpents, is very different from that of the earth-worm, or the
naked &s;nail. The &s;er|pent, as was &s;aid above, has a back-bone, with
numerous joints; and this bone the animal has a power of bending in every
direction, but without being able to &s;horten or lengthen it at plea&s;ure.
The earth-worm, on the other hand, has no back-bone; but its body is compo&s;ed
of rings, which, like a barber's puff, it can lengthen or &s;horten as it finds
nece&s;&s;ary. The earth-worm, therefore, in order to move forward, lengthens
the body; then, by the fore part clings to the ground, where it has reached,
and then con|tracts and brings up its rear: then, when the body is thus
&s;hortened, the fore part is length|ened again for another progre&s;&s;ion;
and &s;o on. The &s;erpent, in&s;tead of &s;hortening the body, bends it into
an arch; and this is the principal difference between &s;erpentine and
vermicular progre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I have in&s;tanced this motion in the viper, as mo&s;t ea&s;ily
di&s;cerned; but there are many &s;er|pents that dart with &s;uch amazing
&s;wiftne&s;s, that they appear rather to leap than crawl. It is mo&s;t
probable, however, that no &s;erpent can dart upon even ground farther than its
own length at one effort. Our fears indeed, may encrea&s;e the force of their
&s;peed, which is &s;ome|times <PB N="182" REF="188"> found &s;o fatal. We are
told by &s;ome, that they will dart to a very great di&s;tance; but this my
enquiries have never been able to a&s;cer|tain. The manner of progre&s;&s;ion
in the &s;wifte&s;t &s;erpent we know, which is the Jaculus, is by in&s;tantly
coiling it&s;elf upon its tail, and darting from thence to its full extent;
then carrying the tail, as quick as lightening, to the head; coiling and
darting again: and by this means proceeding, with extreme rapidity, without
ever quitting the ground. Indeed, if we con&s;ider the length and the
weakne&s;s of the back-bone in all the&s;e animals; if we regard the make of
their vertebrae, in which we &s;hall find the junctures all formed to give
play, and none to give power; we cannot be of opinion that they have a faculty
of &s;pringing from the ground, as they entirely want a <HI>fulcrum,</HI> if I
may &s;o expre&s;s it, from whence to take their &s;pring; the whole body being
compo&s;ed of un&s;upported mu&s;cles and joints that are yielding. It mu&s;t
be con|fe&s;&s;ed, that they dart down from trees upon their prey; but their
weight alone is &s;ufficient for that purpo&s;e, without much effort of their
own.</P>
<P>Though all &s;erpents are amphibious, &s;ome are much fonder of
the water than others; and though de&s;titute of fins or gills, remain at the
bottom, or &s;wim along the &s;urface with great ea&s;e. From their internal
&s;tructure, ju&s;t &s;ketched <PB N="183" REF="189"> above, we &s;ee how well
adapted they are for either element; and how capable their blood is of
circulating at the bottom, as freely as in the frog or the tortoi&s;e. They
can, however, en|dure to live in fre&s;h-water only; for &s;alt is an effectual
bane to the whole tribe. The greate&s;t &s;erpents are mo&s;t u&s;ually found
in fre&s;h-water, either chu&s;ing it as their favourite element, or finding
their prey in &s;uch places in the greate&s;t abundance. But that all will live
and &s;wim in liquids, appears from the experiment of Redi; who put a &s;erpent
into a large gla&s;s ve&s;&s;el of wine, where it lived &s;wimming about &s;ix
hours; though, when it was by force immer&s;ed and kept under that liquid, it
lived only one hour and an half. He put another in common water, where it lived
three days; but when it was kept under water, it lived only about twelve
hours<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Redi, Exper. p. 170.</BIBL></NOTE>. Their
motion there, however, is perfectly the rever&s;e of what it is upon land; for,
in order to &s;upport them&s;elves upon an element lighter than their bodies,
they are obliged to encrea&s;e their &s;urface in a very artificial manner. On
earth their windings are perpendicular to the &s;urface; in water they are
parallel to it: in other words, if I &s;hould wave my hand up and down, it will
give an idea of the animal's progre&s;s on land; if <PB N="184" REF="190"> I
&s;hould wave it to the right and left, it will give &s;ome idea of its
progre&s;s on the water.</P>
<P>Some &s;erpents have a mo&s;t horrible faetor at|tending them,
which is alone capable of intimi|dating the brave. This proceeds from two
glands near the vent, like tho&s;e in the wea&s;el or polecat; and, like
tho&s;e animals, in proportion as they are excited by rage or by fear, the
&s;cent grows &s;tronger. It would &s;eem, however, that &s;uch &s;erpents as
are mo&s;t venomous, are lea&s;t of|fen&s;ive in this particular; &s;ince the
rattle&s;nake and the viper have no &s;mell whatever: nay, we are told, that at
Calecut and Cranganon, in the Ea&s;t Indies, there are &s;ome very noxious
&s;er|pents, who are &s;o far from being di&s;agreeable, that their excrements
are &s;ought after, and kept as the mo&s;t plea&s;ing perfume. The E&s;culapian
Serpent is al&s;o of this number.</P>
<P>Some &s;erpents bring forth their young alive; as the viper:
&s;ome bring forth eggs, which are hatched by the heat of their &s;ituation; as
the Common Black Snake, and the majority of the &s;erpent tribe. When a reader,
ignorant of anatomy, is told, that &s;ome of tho&s;e animals produce their
young alive, and that &s;ome pro|duce eggs only, he is apt to &s;uppo&s;e a
very great difference in the internal conformation, which makes &s;uch a
variety in the manner of <PB N="185" REF="191"> bringing forth. But this is not
the ca&s;e: the&s;e animals are internally alike, in whatever manner they
produce their young; and the variety in their bringing forth, is rather a
&s;light than a real di&s;crimination. The only difference is, that the viper
hatches her eggs, and brings them to maturity within her body; the &s;nake is
more premature in her productions, and &s;ends her eggs into the light, &s;ome
time before the young ones are capable of leaving the &s;hell. Thus, if either
are opened, the eggs will be found in the womb, covered with their mem|branous
&s;hell, and adhering to each other, like large beads on a &s;tring. In the
eggs of both the young ones will be found, though at different &s;tages of
maturity: tho&s;e of the viper will crawl and bite in the moment the &s;hell
that enclo&s;es them is broke open; tho&s;e of the &s;nake are not yet arrived
at their perfect form.</P>
<P>Father Labat took a &s;erpent of the viper kind, that was nine
feet long, and ordered it to be opened in his pre&s;ence. He then &s;aw the
manner in which the eggs of the&s;e animals lie in the womb. In this creature
there were &s;ix eggs, each of the &s;ize of a goo&s;e egg, but longer, more
pointed, and covered with a membranous &s;kin, by which al&s;o they were united
to each other. Each of the&s;e eggs con|tained from thirteen to fifteen young
ones, <PB N="186" REF="192"> about &s;ix inches long, and as thick as a
goo&s;e|quill. Though the female from whence they were taken was &s;potted, the
young &s;eemed to have a variety of colours very different from the parent; and
this led the traveller to &s;uppo&s;e that the colour was no characteri&s;tic
mark among &s;erpents. The&s;e little mi&s;chievous animals were no &s;ooner
let loo&s;e from the &s;hell, than they crept about, and put them&s;elves into
a threatening po&s;ture, coiling them&s;elves up and biting the &s;tick with
which he was de&s;troying them. In this manner he killed &s;eventy-four young
ones; tho&s;e that were contained in one of the eggs e&s;caped at the place
where the female was killed, by the bur&s;ting of the egg and their getting
among the bu&s;hes.</P>
<P>The la&s;t di&s;tinction that I &s;hall mention, but the mo&s;t
material among &s;erpents is, that &s;ome are venomous and &s;ome
inoffen&s;ive. If we con&s;ider the poi&s;on of &s;erpents as it relates to
man, there is no doubt but that it is a &s;courge and an affliction. The
various calamities that the poi&s;on of &s;erpents is capable of producing, are
not only inflicted by the animal it&s;elf, but by men more mi&s;chievous even
than &s;erpents, who pre|pare their venom to de&s;troy each other. With this
the &s;avages poi&s;on their arms, and al&s;o pre|pare their revengeful
potions. The ancients were known to pre&s;erve it for the purpo&s;es of
&s;uicide; <PB N="187" REF="193"> and even among &s;emi barbarous countries at
this day, the venom of &s;nakes is u&s;ed as a philtre.</P>
<P>But. though the poi&s;on be ju&s;tly terrible to us, it has been
given to very good purpo&s;es for the animal's own proper &s;upport and
defence. Without this, &s;erpents of all other animals would be the mo&s;t
expo&s;ed and defencele&s;s; without feet for e&s;caping a pur&s;uit; without
teeth capable of inflicting a dangerous wound, or without &s;trength for
re&s;i&s;tance; incapable, from their &s;ize, of finding &s;ecurity in very
&s;mall retreats like the earth-worm, and di&s;gu&s;ting all from their
deformity, nothing was left for them but a &s;peedy extirpation. But
furni&s;hed as they are with powerful poi&s;on, every rank of animals approach
them with dread, and never &s;eize them but at an advantage. Nor is this all
the advantage they derive from it. The malignity of a few &s;erves for the
protection of all. Though not above a tenth of their number are actually
venomous, yet the &s;imilitude they all bear to each other excites a general
terror of the whole tribe; and the uncertainty of their enemies in which the
poi&s;on chiefly re&s;ides, makes even the mo&s;t harmle&s;s formidable. Thus
Providence &s;eems to have acted with double precaution; it has given &s;ome of
them poi&s;on for the general defence of a tribe naturally feeble; but it has 
<PB N="188" REF="194"> thinned the numbers of tho&s;e which are venom|ous,
le&s;t they &s;hould become too powerful for the re&s;t of animated nature.</P>
<P>From the&s;e noxious qualities in the &s;erpent kind, it is no
wonder that not only man, but bea&s;ts and birds, carry on an uncea&s;ing war
again&s;t them. The ichneumon of the Indians, and the pecary of America,
de&s;troy them in great numbers. The&s;e animals have the art of &s;eizing them
near the head; and it is &s;aid that they can &s;kin them with great
dexte|rity. The vulture and the eagle al&s;o prey upon them in great abundance;
and often &s;ou&s;ing down from the clouds, drop upon a long &s;erpent, which
they &s;natch up &s;truggling and writhing in the air. Dogs al&s;o are bred up
to oppo&s;e them. Father Feuill&eacute;e tells us, that being in the woods of
Martinico, he was attacked by a large &s;erpent, which he could not ea&s;ily
avoid, when his dog immediately came to his relief, and &s;eized the
a&s;&s;ailant with great courage. The &s;erpent entwined him, and pre&s;&s;ed
him &s;o violently, that the blood came out of his mouth, and yet the dog never
cea&s;ed till he had tore it to pieces. The dog was not &s;en&s;ible of his
wounds during the fight; but &s;oon after his head &s;welled prodigiou&s;ly,
and he lay on the ground as dead. But his ma&s;ter <PB N="189" REF="195">
having found hard by a banana tree, he applied its juice, mixed with treacle,
to the wounds, which recovered the dog, and quickly healed his &s;ores.</P>
<P>But it is in man that the&s;e venomous crea|tures find the
mo&s;t dangerous enemy. The P&s;ylli of old were famous for charming and
de&s;troying &s;erpents. Some moderns pretend to the &s;ame art. Ca&s;&s;aubon
&s;ays that he knew a man who could at any time &s;ummon an hundred &s;erpents
together, and draw them into the fire. Upon a certain occa&s;ion, when one of
them bigger than the re&s;t would not be brought in, he only repeated his
charm, and it came forward, like the re&s;t, to &s;ubmit to the flames.
Philo|&s;tratus de&s;cribes particularly how the Indians charm &s;erpents. 
<Q REND="inline">"They take a &s;carlet robe embroidered with
golden letters, and &s;pread it before a &s;erpent's hole. The golden letters
have a fa&s;cinating power; and by looking &s;tedfa&s;tly, the &s;erpent's eyes
are overcome and laid a&s;leep."</Q> The&s;e and many other feats have been
often practi&s;ed upon the&s;e animals by artful men, who had fir&s;t prepared
the &s;erpents for their exerci&s;e, and then exhi|bited them as
adventitiou&s;ly a&s;&s;embled at their call. In India there is nothing &s;o
common as dancing &s;erpents, which are carried about in a 
<PB N="190" REF="196"> broad flat ve&s;&s;el &s;omewhat re&s;embling a &s;ieve.
The&s;e erect and put them&s;elves in motion at the word of command. When their
keeper &s;ings a &s;low tune, they &s;eem by their heads to keep time; when he
&s;ings a quicker mea&s;ure, they appear to move more bri&s;k and lively. All
animals have a certain degree of docility; and we find that &s;erpents
them&s;elves can be brought to move and approach at the voice of their
ma&s;ter. From this trick &s;ucce&s;sfully practi&s;ed before the ignorant, it
is mo&s;t probable has ari&s;en all the boa&s;ted preten&s;ions which &s;ome
have made to charming of &s;erpents; an art to which the native Americans
pretend at this very day. One of Linnaeus's pupils we are told pur|cha&s;ed the
&s;ecret from an Indian, and then di&s;|covered it to his ma&s;ter; but, like
all &s;ecrets of the kind, it is probable this ended in a few unmeaning words
of no efficacy.</P>
<P>Though the generality of mankind regard this formidable race
with horror, yet there have been &s;ome nations, and there are &s;ome at this
day, that con&s;ider them with veneration and regard. The adoration paid by the
ancient Egyptians to a &s;erpent is well known: many of the nations at
pre&s;ent along the we&s;tern coa&s;t of Africa retain the &s;ame unaccountable
veneration. Upon the gold and &s;lave coa&s;ts, a &s;tranger, 
<PB N="191" REF="197"> upon entering the cottages of the natives, is often
&s;urprized to &s;ee the roof &s;warming with &s;erpents, that cling there
without mole&s;ting and unmole&s;ted by the natives. But his &s;urprize will
encrea&s;e upon going farther &s;outhward to the kingdom of Widah, when he
finds that a &s;erpent is the god of the country. This animal, which travellers
de&s;cribe as a huge overgrown creature, has its habitation, its temple, and
its prie&s;ts. The&s;e impre&s;s the vulgar with an opinion of its virtues; and
numbers are daily &s;een to offer not only their goods, their pro|vi&s;ions,
and their prayers, at the &s;hrine of their hideous deity, but al&s;o their
wives and daughters. The&s;e the prie&s;ts readily accept of, and after &s;ome
days of penance, return them to their &s;up|pliants, much benefited by the
&s;erpent's &s;up|po&s;ed embraces. Such a complicated picture of ignorance and
impo&s;ture gives no very fa|vourable impre&s;&s;ions of our fellow creatures;
but we may &s;ay in defence of human nature, that the mo&s;t frightful of
reptiles is wor&s;hipped by the mo&s;t uncultivated and barbarous of
mankind.</P>
<P>From this general picture of the &s;erpent tribe, one great
di&s;tinction obviou&s;ly pre&s;ents it&s;elf; namely, into tho&s;e that are
venomous and tho&s;e that are wholly de&s;titute of poi&s;on. 
<PB N="192" REF="198"> To the fir&s;t belong the viper, the rattle&s;nake, the
cobra di capello, and all their affinities: to the other, the common black
&s;nake, the lyboya, the boiguacu, the amphi&s;baena, and various others that,
though de&s;titute of venom, do not cea&s;e to be formidable. I will therefore
give their hi&s;tory &s;eparately, beginning with the ve|nomous cla&s;s as they
have the &s;tronge&s;t claims to our notice and attention.</P>

<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="193" REF="199">
<HEAD>CHAP. IX. Of venomous Serpents in general.</HEAD>
<P>THE poi&s;on of &s;erpents has been for ages one of the
greate&s;t objects of human con&s;ideration. To us who &s;eldom feel the
vengeful wound, it is merely a &s;ubject of curio&s;ity; but to tho&s;e placed
in the mid&s;t of the &s;erpent tribe, who are every day expo&s;ed to &s;ome
new di&s;a&s;ter, it becomes a matter of the mo&s;t &s;erious importance. To
remedy the bite of a &s;erpent is con&s;idered among our phy&s;icians as one of
the &s;lighte&s;t operations in medicine; but among the phy|&s;icians of the
ea&s;t, the antidotes for this cala|mity make up the bulk of their
di&s;pen&s;aries. In our colder climates, the venom does not ap|pear with that
in&s;tantaneous operation which it exhibits in the warmer regions; for either
its powers are le&s;s exqui&s;ite, or our fluids are not carried round in
&s;uch rapid circulation.</P>
<P>In all countries, however, the poi&s;on of the &s;erpent is
&s;ufficiently formidable to de&s;erve notice, and to excite our attention to
its nature and effects. It will therefore in the fir&s;t place be proper to
de&s;cribe its &s;eat in the animal, as al&s;o the in&s;trument by which the
wound is made <PB N="194" REF="200"> and the poi&s;on injected. In all this
venomous cla&s;s of reptiles, whether the viper, the rattle|&s;nake, or the
cobra di capello, there are two large teeth or fangs that i&s;&s;ue from the
upper jaw, and that hang out beyond the lower. The re&s;t of the &s;nake tribe
are de&s;titute of the&s;e; and it is mo&s;t probable that wherever the&s;e
fangs are wanting, the animal is harmle&s;s; on the con|trary, wherever they
are found it is to be avoided as the mo&s;t pe&s;tilent enemy. The&s;e are the
in&s;truments that &s;eem to place the true di&s;tinc|tion between animals of
the &s;erpent kind; the wounds which the&s;e fangs inflict produce the mo&s;t
dangerous &s;ymptoms; the wounds inflicted by the teeth only are attended with
nothing more than the ordinary con&s;equences attending the bite of any other
animal. Our fir&s;t great at|tention, therefore, upon &s;eeing a &s;erpent
&s;hould be directed to the teeth. If it has the fang teeth, it is to be placed
among the venomous, cla&s;s; if it wants them, it may be &s;et down as
inoffen&s;ive. I am not ignorant that many &s;er|pents are &s;aid to be
dangerous who&s;e jaws are unfurni&s;hed with fangs; but it is mo&s;t probable
that our terrors only have furni&s;hed the&s;e ani|mals with venom; for of all
the tribe who&s;e teeth are thus formed, not one will be found to have a bag
for containing poi&s;on, nor a con|duit <PB N="195" REF="201"> for injecting it
into the wound. The Black Snake, the Liboya, the Blind Worm, and a hundred
others that might be mentioned, have their teeth of an equal &s;ize, fixed into
the jaws, and with no other apparatus for in|flicting a dangerous wound than a
dog or a lizard; but it is otherwi&s;e with the venomous tribe we are now
de&s;cribing; the&s;e are well furni&s;hed, not only with an elaboratory where
the poi&s;on is formed, but a canal by which it is conducted to the jaw, a bag
under the tooth for keeping it ready for every occa&s;ion, and al&s;o an
aperture in the tooth it&s;elf for injecting it into the wound. To be more
particular, the glands that &s;erve to fabricate this venomous fluid are
&s;ituated on each &s;ide of the head behind the eyes, and have their canals
leading from thence to the bottom of the fangs in the upper jaw, where they
empty into a kind of bladder, from whence the fangs on each &s;ide are &s;een
to grow. The venom contained in this bladder is a yellowi&s;h thick
ta&s;tele&s;s liquor, which injected into the blood is death, yet which may be
&s;wal|lowed without any danger.</P>
<P>The fangs that give the wound come next under ob&s;ervation;
they are large in proportion to the &s;ize of the animal that bears them;
crooked, yet &s;harp enough to inflict a ready <PB N="196" REF="202"> wound.
They grow one on each &s;ide, and &s;ometimes two, from two moveable bones in
the upper jaw, which by &s;liding backward or forward, have a power of erecting
or depre&s;&s;ing the teeth at plea&s;ure. In the&s;e bones are al&s;o fixed
many teeth, but no way venomous, and only &s;erving to take and hold the
animal's prey. Be&s;ides this apt di&s;po&s;ition of the fangs, they are hollow
within, and have an opening towards the point like the &s;lit of a pen, through
which when the fang is pre&s;&s;ed down upon the bladder where it grows, there
is &s;een to i&s;&s;ue a part of the venom that lay below. To de&s;cribe this
operation at once, when the &s;erpent is irritated to give a venomous wound, it
opens its for|midable jaws to the wide&s;t extent; the moveable bones of the
upper jaw &s;lide forward; the fangs that lay before inclining are thus
erected; they are &s;truck with force into the fle&s;h of the ob|noxious
per&s;on; by meeting re&s;i&s;tance at the points, they pre&s;s upon the
bladders of venom from whence they grow; the venom i&s;&s;ues up through the
hollow of the tooth; and is pre&s;&s;ed out through its &s;lit into the wound,
which by this time the tooth has made in the &s;kin. Thus from a &s;light
puncture, and the infu&s;ion of a drop of venom &s;carce larger than the head
of a pin, the part is quickly enflamed and, without <PB N="197" REF="203"> a
proper antidote, the whole frame contami|nated.</P>
<P>The appearances which this venom produces are different,
according to the &s;erpent that wounds, or the &s;ea&s;on, or the &s;trength of
the animal that &s;trikes the blow. If a viper inflicts the wound, and the
remedy be neglected, the &s;ymptoms are not without danger. It fir&s;t cau&s;es
an acute pain in the place affected, attended with a &s;welling, fir&s;t red,
and afterwards livid. This by degrees &s;preads to the neighbouring parts;
great faintne&s;s and a quick, though low and interrupted, pul&s;e en&s;ues: to
this &s;ucceed great &s;ickne&s;s at the &s;tomach, billious and con|vul&s;ive
vomitings, cold &s;weats, pains about the navel, and death it&s;elf. But the
violence of the&s;e &s;ymptoms depend much on the &s;ea&s;on of the year, the
difference of the climate, the &s;ize or rage of the animal, and the depth and
&s;itua|tion of the wound. The&s;e &s;ymptoms are much more violent, and
&s;ucceed each other more ra|pidly after the bite of a rattle-&s;nake; but when
the per&s;on is bit by the cobra di capello, he dies in an hour, his whole
frame being di&s;&s;olved into a putrid ma&s;s of corruption.</P>
<P>Nothing &s;urely can more ju&s;tly excite our wonder than that
&s;o &s;mall a quantity of venom &s;hould produce &s;uch powerful and deadly
effects. <PB N="198" REF="204"> If the venom it&s;elf be examined through a
mi|cro&s;cope, it will be found to &s;hoot into little chry&s;tals that, to an
imagination already im|pre&s;&s;ed with its potency, look like &s;o many darts
fit for entering the blood-ve&s;&s;els, and wounding their tender coats. But
all the&s;e darts are wholly of our own making; the &s;ofte&s;t milde&s;t fluid
whatever, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any con&s;i&s;tency, will form chry&s;tals under
the eye of the micro|&s;cope, and put on an appearance exactly like the venom
of the viper. In fact, this venom has no acrid ta&s;te whatever; and to all
experi|ments that our &s;en&s;es can make upon it, appears a &s;limy in&s;ipid
fluid. Charas, who often ta&s;ted it, a&s;&s;ures us of the fact; and
a&s;&s;erts, that it may be taken inwardly without any &s;en&s;ible effects or
any prejudice to the con&s;titution. But the famous experiments that were tried
by Redi and others, in the pre&s;ence of the Great Duke of Tu&s;cany and his
court, put this beyond any doubt what&s;oever. By the&s;e it appeared, that the
&s;erpent having once bitten, exhau&s;ted for that time the greate&s;t part of
its poi&s;on; and though the wound cau&s;ed by its biting a &s;econd time was
attended with &s;ome malignant &s;ymp|toms, yet they were much milder than
before. It appeared that the &s;erpent biting upon a &s;ponge, or a piece of
&s;oft bread, and then biting <PB N="199" REF="205"> a dog immediately after,
did not inflict a wound more dangerous than the prick of a needle. It appeared
that the venom being collected, and a needle dipped therein, this produced
almo&s;t as painful effects as the tooth of the animal it&s;elf. But what
cau&s;ed the greate&s;t &s;urprize in the court was the &s;eeming ra&s;hne&s;s
of one Tozzi, a viper-catcher; who, while the philo&s;ophers were giving
elaborate lectures on the danger of the poi&s;on when taken internally, boldly
de&s;ired a large quantity of it might be put together; and then, with the
utmo&s;t confidence, drank it off before them all. The court was &s;truck with
a&s;toni&s;hment, and expected that the man would in&s;tantly fall dead; but
they &s;oon perceived their mi&s;take, and found that taken in this manner the
poi&s;on was as harmle&s;s as water; &s;o true is that famous pa&s;&s;age of
Lucan, 
<Q> 
<L>Noxia &s;erpentum e&s;t admixto &s;anguine pe&s;tis:</L> 
<L>Mor&s;u virus habent, et fatum in dente minantur:</L> 
<L>Pocula morte carent.</L></Q></P>
<P>What then &s;hall we &s;ay to the &s;peedy effect of &s;o
&s;eemingly harmle&s;s a liquid taken into the circulation? Let us fir&s;t
ob&s;erve, that milk is one of the mo&s;t mild and nouri&s;hing of all fluids,
and &s;eemingly the mo&s;t friendly to the human con&s;titution; yet if milk be
injected into a vein, <PB N="200" REF="206"> it will quickly become fatal, and
kill with more certain de&s;truction than even the venom of the viper. From
hence then we may infer, that the introducing not only the &s;erpentine venom,
but al&s;o a quantity of any other mixture, into the circulation, will be
fatal; and that, con&s;e|quently, &s;erpents kill as well by their power of
injecting the wound as by the potency of their poi&s;on. Some indeed may inject
a more acri|monious mixture, and this may produce more &s;peedy effects; but
any mixture thus injected would be dangerous, and many would be fatal.</P>
<P>Ray gives us an in&s;tance of the potency of the &s;erpent
poi&s;on; which, though it has all the air of a fable, I cannot help
tran&s;cribing. 
<Q REND="inline">"A gentleman who went over to the Ea&s;t-Indies,
while he was one day &s;itting among &s;ome friends, was acco&s;ted by an
Indian &s;muggler, who offered to &s;hew him &s;ome ex|periments re&s;pecting
the venom of &s;erpents; an exhibition u&s;ual enough in that country. Having
fir&s;t, therefore, produced a large &s;er|pent, he a&s;&s;ured the company
that it was harmle&s;s; and to convince them of what he &s;aid, he tied up his
arm, as is u&s;ual with tho&s;e who are going to be bled, and whipped the
&s;erpent till it was provoked to bite him. Having drawn in this manner about
half a <PB N="201" REF="207"> &s;poonful of blood from his arm, he put the
congealed clot upon his thigh. He then took out a much &s;maller &s;erpent,
which was no other than the cobra di capello; and having tied up its neck, he
procured about half a drop of its venom, which he &s;prinkled on the clot of
blood on his thigh, which in&s;tantly began to &s;erment and bubble, and &s;oon
changed colour from a red into yellow."</Q></P>
<P>This he pretended was cau&s;ed by the extreme malignity of that
animal's venom; however, I have no doubt that the whole is either a fable, or a
trick of the Indian; who, while he &s;eemed to mix the &s;erpent's venom,
actually infu&s;ed &s;ome &s;tronger ingredient, &s;ome mineral acid, into the
ma&s;s of blood, which was capable of working &s;uch a change. It cannot be
&s;uppo&s;ed that any animal poi&s;on could act &s;o powerfully upon the blood
already drawn and coagulated; for a poi&s;on that could operate thus
in&s;tan|taneou&s;ly upon cold blood, could not fail of &s;oon de&s;troying the
animal it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Be this as it will, the effects of &s;erpent poi&s;on are but
too well known, though the manner of operation be not &s;o clear. As none of
this malignant tribe grow to a great &s;ize, the longe&s;t of them not
exceeding nine feet, they &s;eldom &s;eek the combat with larger animals, or
offend <PB N="202" REF="208"> others till they are fir&s;t offended. Did they
exert their malignity in proportion to their power, they could ea&s;ily drive
the ranks of nature before them; but they &s;eem uncon&s;cious of their own
&s;uperiority, and rather fly than offer to meet the meane&s;t oppo&s;er. Their
food chiefly con&s;i&s;ts of &s;mall prey, &s;uch as birds, moles, toads and
lizards; &s;o that they never attack the more formidable animals that would
&s;eldom die unrevenged. They lurk therefore in the clefts of rocks, or among
&s;tony places; they twine round the branches of trees, or &s;un them&s;elves
in the long gra&s;s at the bottom. There they only &s;eek repo&s;e and
&s;afety. If &s;ome unwary traveller invades their retreats, their fir&s;t
effort is to &s;ly; but when either pur|&s;ued or accidentally trod upon, they
then make a fierce and fatal re&s;i&s;tance. For this purpo&s;e, they rai&s;e
them&s;elves according to their &s;trength upon their tail, erect the head,
&s;eize the limb that pre&s;&s;es them, the wound is given and the head
withdrawn in a moment. It is not therefore without rea&s;on, that the
A&s;iatics, who live in regions where &s;erpents greatly abound, wear boots and
long cloaths, which very well protect their lower parts from the accidental
re&s;entment of their reptile annoyers.</P>
<P>In the ea&s;tern and we&s;tern Indies, the number 
<PB N="203" REF="209"> of noxious &s;erpents is various; in this country we are
acquainted only with one. The viper is the only animal in Great Britain from
who&s;e bite we have any thing to fear. In the tropical climates, the
rattle-&s;nake, the whip-&s;nake, and the cobra di capello, are the mo&s;t
formidable, though by no means the mo&s;t common. From the general notoriety of
the&s;e particular &s;erpents, and the univer&s;al terror which they
occa&s;ion, it would &s;eem that few others are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch
powerful malignity.</P>
<P>Vipers are found in many parts of this i&s;land; but the dry,
&s;tony, and in particular the chalky, countries abound with them. This animal
&s;eldom grows to a greater length than two feet; though &s;ometimes they are
found above three. The ground colour of their bodies is a dirty yellow; that of
the female is deeper. The back is marked the whole length with a &s;eries of
rhomboid black &s;pots, touching each other at the points; the &s;ides with
triangular ones, the belly entirely black. It is chiefly di&s;tingui&s;hed from
the common black &s;nake by the colour, which in the latter is more
beauti|fully mottled, as well as by the head, which is thicker than the body;
but particularly by the tail, which in the viper, though it ends in a point,
does not run tapering to &s;o great a length <PB N="204" REF="210"> as in the
other. When, therefore, other di|&s;tinctions fail, the difference of the tail
can be di&s;cerned at a &s;ingle glance.</P>
<P>The viper differs from mo&s;t other &s;erpents in being much
&s;lower, as al&s;o in excluding its young compleatly formed, and bringing them
forth alive. The kindne&s;s of Providence &s;eems exerted not only in
dimini&s;hing the &s;peed, but al&s;o the fertility, of this dangerous
creature. They copulate in May, and are &s;uppo&s;ed to be about three months
before they bring forth, and have &s;eldom above eleven eggs at a time. The&s;e
are of the &s;ize of a blackbird's eggs, and chained together in the womb like
a &s;tring of beads. Each egg contains from one to four young ones; &s;o that
the whole of a brood may amount to about twenty or thirty. They con|tinue in
the womb till they come to &s;uch per|fection as to be able to bur&s;t from the
&s;hell; and they are &s;aid by their own efforts to creep from their
confinement into the open air, where they continue for &s;everal days without
taking any food what&s;oever. 
<Q REND="inline">"We have been often a&s;&s;ured," &s;ays Mr.
Penant, "by intelligent people, of the truth of a fact, that the young of the
viper when terrified will run down the throat of the parent, and &s;eek
&s;helter in its belly in the &s;ame manner as the young of the 
<PB N="205" REF="211"> oppo&s;&s;um retire into the ventral pouch of the old
one. From this," continues he, "&s;ome have imagined that the viper is &s;o
unnatural as to devour its own young; but this de&s;erves no credit, as the&s;e
animals live upon frogs, toads, lizards, and young birds, which they &s;wallow
whole, though the mor&s;el is often three times as thick as their own
body."</Q></P>
<P>The viper is capable of &s;upporting very long ab&s;tinence, it
being known that &s;ome have been kept in a box &s;ix months without food; yet
du|ring the whole time they did not abate of their vivacity. They feed only a
&s;mall part of the year, but never during their confinement; for if mice,
their favourite diet, &s;hould at that time be thrown into their box, though
they will kill, yet they will never eat, them. When at liberty, they re|main
torpid throughout the winter; yet, when confined, have never been ob&s;erved to
take their annual repo&s;e. Their poi&s;on, however, decrea&s;es in proportion
to the length of their confinement; and it is thought, that the virtues of the
animal's fle&s;h are, by the &s;ame re&s;traints, con&s;iderably
le&s;&s;ened.</P>
<P>They are u&s;ually taken with wooden tongs, by the end of the
tail, which may be done without danger; for, while held in that po&s;ition,
they are unable to wind them&s;elve up to hurt <PB N="206" REF="212"> their
enemy: yet, notwith&s;tanding this pre|caution, the viper-catchers are
frequently bit by them; but, by the application of &s;allad-oil, the bite is
effectually cured.</P>
<P>One William Oliver, a viper-catcher at Bath, was the fir&s;t who
di&s;covered this admirable re|medy. On the fir&s;t of June, 1735, in the
pre|&s;ence of a great number of per&s;ons, he &s;uffered him&s;elf to be bit
by an old black viper, brought by one of the company, upon the wri&s;t, and
joint of the thumb of the right hand, &s;o that drops of blood came out of the
wounds: he im|mediately felt a violent pain both at the top of his thumb, and
up his arm, even before the viper was loo&s;ened from his hand; &s;oon after he
felt a pain, re&s;embling that of burning, trickle up his arm; in a few minutes
his eyes began to look red and fiery, and to water much; in le&s;s than an hour
he perceived the venom &s;eize his heart, with a pricking pain, which was
attended with faintne&s;s, &s;hortne&s;s of breath, and cold &s;weats; in a few
minutes after this, his belly began to &s;well, with great gripings, and pains
in his back, which were attended with vomitings and purgings: during the
violence of the&s;e &s;ymp|toms, his &s;ight was gone for &s;everal minutes,
but he could hear all the while. He &s;aid, that in his former experiments, he
had never de|ferred <PB N="207" REF="213"> making u&s;e of his remedy longer
than he perceived the effects of the venom reaching his heart; but this time,
being willing to &s;atisfy the company thoroughly, and tru&s;ting to the
&s;peedy effects of his remedy, which was nothing more than olive-oil, he
forbore to apply any thing, till he found him&s;elf exceeding ill and quite
giddy. About an hour and a quarter after the fir&s;t of his being bit, a
chaffing-di&s;h of glowing charcoal was brought in, and his naked arm was held
over it, as near as he could bear, while his wife rubbed in the oil with her
hand, turning his arm continually round, as if &s;he would have roa&s;ted it
over the coals: he &s;aid the poi&s;on &s;oon abated, but the &s;welling did
not dimini&s;h much. Mo&s;t violent purgings and vomitings &s;oon en&s;ued; and
his pul&s;e became &s;o low, and &s;o often interrupted, that it was thought
proper to order him a repetition of cordial potions: he &s;aid he was not
&s;en&s;ible of any great relief from the&s;e; but that a gla&s;s or two of
olive-oil drank down, &s;eemed to give him ea&s;e. Continuing in this dangerous
con|dition, he was put to bed, where his arm was again bathed over a pan of
charcoal, and rub|bed with &s;allad-oil, heated in a ladle over the charcoal,
by Dr. Mortimer's direction, who was the phy&s;ician that drew up the account.
From <PB N="208" REF="214"> this la&s;t operation he declared that he found
immediate ea&s;e, as though by &s;ome charm: he &s;oon after fell into a
profound &s;leep, and, after about nine hours &s;ound re&s;t, awaked about
&s;ix the next morning, and found him&s;elf very well; but in the afternoon, on
drinking &s;ome rum and &s;trong beer, &s;o as to be almo&s;t intoxicated, the
&s;welling returned, with much pain and cold &s;weats, which abated &s;oon, on
bathing the arm, as before, and wrapping it up in a brown pa|per, &s;oaked in
the oil.</P>
<P>Such are the effects of the viper's bite; yet its fle&s;h has
long been celebrated as a noble me|dicine. A broth, made by boiling one viper
in a quart of water till it comes to a pint, is the u&s;ual method in which it
is given at pre&s;ent; and it is &s;aid to be a very powerful re&s;torative in
battered con&s;titutions: the &s;alt of vipers is al&s;o thought to exceed any
other animal &s;alt whatever, in giving vigour to the languid cir|culation, and
prompting to venery.</P>
<P>The Rattle-&s;nake is bred in America, and in no part of the old
world. Some are as thick as a man's leg, and &s;ix feet in length; but the
mo&s;t u&s;ual &s;ize is from four to five feet long. In mo&s;t particulars it
re&s;embles the viper: like that animal, having a large head and a &s;mall
neck, being of a du&s;ky colour, and furni&s;hed <PB REF="215">

</FIGURE> <PB N="209" REF="216"> with fangs that inflict the
mo&s;t terrible wounds. It differs, however, in having a large &s;cale, which
hangs like a penthou&s;e over each eye. The eye al&s;o is furni&s;hed with a
nictitating membrane, that pre&s;erves it from du&s;t; and its &s;cales are of
a con&s;iderable degree of hardne&s;s. They are of an orange, tawny, and
blacki&s;h co|lour on the back; and of an a&s;h-colour on the belly, inclining
to lead. The male may be readily di&s;tingui&s;hed from the female, by a black
velvet &s;pot on the head, and by the head being &s;maller and longer. But that
which, be|&s;ides their &s;uperior malignity, di&s;tingui&s;hes them from all
other animals, is their rattle, an in&s;tru|ment lodged in their tail, by which
they make &s;uch a loud, rattling noi&s;e, when they move, that their approach
may readily be perceived, and the danger avoided. This rattle, which is placed
in the tail, &s;omewhat re&s;embles, when taken out of the body, the curb chain
of a bri|dle: it is compo&s;ed of &s;everal thin, hard, hollow bones, linked to
each other, and rattling upon the &s;lighte&s;t motion. It is &s;uppo&s;ed by
&s;ome, that the &s;nake acquires an additional bone every year; and that, from
hence, its age may be pre|ci&s;ely known: however this may be, certain it is,
that the young &s;nakes, of a year or two old, have no rattles at all; while
many old ones have <PB N="210" REF="217"> been killed, that had from eleven to
thirteen joints each. They &s;hake and make a noi&s;e with the&s;e rattles with
prodigious quickne&s;s when they are di&s;turbed; however, the peccary and the
vulture are no way terrified at the &s;ound, but ha&s;ten, at the &s;ignal, to
&s;eize the &s;nake, as their mo&s;t favourite prey.</P>
<P>It is very different with almo&s;t every other animal. The
certain death which en&s;ues from this terrible creature's bite, makes a
&s;olitude wherever it is heard. It moves along with the mo&s;t maje&s;tic
rapidity; neither &s;eeking to offend the larger animals, nor fearing their
in&s;ults. If unprovoked, it never meddles with any thing but its natural prey;
but when accidentally trod upon, or pur&s;ued to be de&s;troyed, it then makes
a dreadful and de&s;perate defence. It erects it|&s;elf upon its tail, throws
back the head, and in|flicts its wound in a moment; then parts, and inflicts a
&s;econd wound: after which, we are told, by &s;ome, that it remains torpid and
inactive, without even attempting to e&s;cape.</P>
<P>The very in&s;tant the wound is inflicted, though &s;mall in
it&s;elf, it appears more painful than the &s;ting of a bee. This pain, which
is &s;o &s;uddenly felt, far from abating, grows every moment more excruciating
and dangerous: the limb wells; the venom reaches the head, which 
<PB N="211" REF="218"> is &s;oon of a mon&s;trous &s;ize; the eyes are red and
fiery; the heart beats quick, with frequent interruptions: the pain becomes
in&s;upportable, and &s;ome expire under it in five or &s;ix hours; but others,
who are of &s;tronger con&s;titutions, &s;urvive the agony for a few hours
longer, only to &s;ink under a general mortification, which en&s;ues, and
corrupts the whole body.</P>
<P>As a gentleman in Virginia was walking in the fields for his
amu&s;ement, he accidentally trod upon a rattle &s;nake, that had been lurking
in a &s;tony place; which, enraged by the pre&s;&s;ure, reared up, bit his
hand, and &s;hook its rattles. The gentleman readily perceived that he was in
the mo&s;t dreadful danger; but unwilling to die unrevenged, he killed the
&s;nake, and carrying it home in his hand, threw it on the ground before his
family, crying out, I am killed, and there is my murderer! In &s;uch an
extremity, the &s;peedie&s;t remedies were the be&s;t. His arm, which was
beginning to &s;well, was tied up near the &s;houlder, the wound was anointed
with oil, and every precaution taken to &s;top the infection. By the help of a
very &s;trong con&s;titution he re|covered; but not without feeling the mo&s;t
va|rious and dreadful &s;ymptoms for &s;everal weeks together. His arm, below
the ligature, ap|peared of &s;everal colours, with a writhing among 
<PB N="212" REF="219"> the mu&s;cles, that, to his terrified imagination,
appeared like the motions of the animal that had wounded him. A fever en&s;ued;
the lo&s;s of his hair, giddine&s;s, drought, weakne&s;s, and nervous
faintings: till, by &s;low degrees, a very &s;trong habit overpowered the
latent malignity of the poi&s;on.</P>
<P>Several remedies have been tried to alleviate this calamity. A
decoction of the Virginian &s;nake-root is con&s;idered as the mo&s;t
effectual; and at the &s;ame time the head of the animal brui&s;ed and laid
upon the part affected, is thought to a&s;&s;i&s;t the cure. In general,
however, it is found to be fatal; and the Indians, &s;en&s;ible of this, take
care to dip their arrows in the poi&s;on under the rattle &s;nake's fangs, when
they de&s;ire to take a &s;ignal revenge of their enemies.</P>
<P>Thus much concerning this animal is agreed upon by every
naturali&s;t: there are other cir|cum&s;tances in its hi&s;tory, which are not
&s;o well a&s;certained. And fir&s;t, its motion, which &s;ome de&s;cribe as
the &s;wifte&s;t imaginable; a&s;&s;erting, that its Indian name of Ecacoalt,
which &s;ignifies the wind-&s;erpent, implies its agility: others, on the
contrary, a&s;&s;ert, that it is the &s;lowe&s;t and the mo&s;t &s;luggi&s;h of
all &s;erpents; and that it &s;eldom moves from one place. In this
oppo|&s;ition <PB N="213" REF="220"> of opinions, there are others, who
a&s;&s;ert, that on even ground it moves but &s;lowly; but then, among rocks,
that it goes at a great rate. If we may argue from analogy, the opinion of
tho&s;e who contend for its &s;low motion, &s;eems the mo&s;t probable; as the
viper, which it &s;o very much re&s;embles, is remarkable among &s;erpents for
its inactivity.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid al&s;o by &s;ome, that the rattle-&s;nake has a
power of charming its prey into its mouth; and this is as &s;trongly
contradicted by others. The inhabitants of Pen&s;ylvania are &s;aid to have
opportunities of ob&s;erving this &s;trange fa&s;cination every day. The
&s;nake is often &s;een ba&s;king at the foot of a tree, where birds and
&s;quirrels make their re&s;idence. There, coiled upon its tail, its jaws
extended, and its eyes &s;hining like fire, the rattle-&s;nake levels its
dreadful glare upon one of the little animals above. The bird or the
&s;quirrel, which ever it may be, too plainly perceives the mi&s;chief
me|ditating again&s;t it, and hops from branch to branch, with a timorous,
plaintive &s;ound, wi&s;h|ing to avoid, yet incapable of breaking through the
fa&s;cination: thus it continues for &s;ome time its feeble efforts and
complaints, but is &s;till &s;een approaching lower and lower towards the
bot|tom branches of the tree, until, at la&s;t, as if <PB N="214" REF="221">
overcome by the potency of its fears, it jumps down from the tree directly into
the throat of its frightful de&s;troyer.</P>
<P>In order to a&s;certain the truth of this &s;tory, a mou&s;e was
put into a large iron cage, where a rattle &s;nake was kept, and the effects
carefully ob&s;erved. The mou&s;e remained motionle&s;s at one end of the cage;
while the &s;nake, at the other, continued fixed, with its eye glaring full on
the little animal, and its jaws opened to their wide&s;t extent: the mou&s;e
for &s;ome time &s;eemed eager to e&s;cape; but every effort only &s;erved to
encrea&s;e its terrors, and to draw it &s;till nearer the enemy; till, after
&s;everal ineffectual attempts to break the fa&s;cination, it was &s;een to run
into the jaws of the rattle-&s;nake, where it was in|&s;tantly killed.</P>
<P>To the&s;e accounts the incredulous oppo&s;e the improbability
of the fact; they a&s;&s;ert, that &s;uch a power a&s;cribed to &s;erpents, is
only the rem|nant of a vulgar error, by which it was &s;uppo&s;ed that
&s;erpents could be charmed, and had al&s;o a power of charming. They aver,
that animals are &s;o far from running down the throat of a rattle &s;nake in
captivity, that the &s;nake will eat nothing in that &s;tate, but actually dies
for want of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>A &s;erpent, called the Whip-&s;nake, is &s;till 
<PB N="215" REF="222"> more venomous than the former. This animal, which is a
native of the ea&s;t, is about five feet long, yet not much thicker than the
thong of a coachman's whip. It is exceedingly venomous; and its bite is &s;aid
to kill in about &s;ix hours. One of the Je&s;uit mi&s;&s;ionaries, happening
to enter into an Indian pagoda, &s;aw what he took to be a whip-cord lying on
the floor, and &s;tooped to take it up; but, upon handling it, what was his
&s;urprize to find that it was ani|mated, and no other than the whip-&s;nake,
of which he had heard &s;uch formidable accounts: fortune, however, &s;eemed
favourable to him, for he gra&s;ped it by the head, &s;o that it had no power
to bite him, and only twi&s;ted its folds up his arm. In this manner he held
it, till it was killed by tho&s;e who came to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>To this formidable cla&s;s might be added the A&s;p, who&s;e
bite however is not attended with tho&s;e drow&s;y &s;ymptoms which the
ancients a&s;cribed to it. The Jaculus of Jamaica al&s;o, is one of the
&s;wifte&s;t of the &s;erpent kind. The Hoemorrhois, &s;o called from the
hoemorrhages which its bite is &s;aid to produce; the Seps, who&s;e wound is
very venomous, and cau&s;es the part affected to corrupt in a very &s;hort
time; the Coral Serpent, which is red, and who&s;e bite is &s;aid to be fatal.
But of all others, the Cobra <PB N="216" REF="223"> di Capello, or Hooded
Serpent, inflicts the mo&s;t deadly and incurable wounds. Of this formidable
creature there are five or &s;ix different kinds; but they are all equally
dangerous, and their bite followed by &s;peedy and certain death. It is from
three to eight feet long, with two large fangs hanging out of the upper jaw. It
has a broad neck, and a mark of dark brown on the forehead; which, when viewed
frontwi&s;e, looks like a pair of &s;pectacles; but behind, like the head of a
cat. The eyes are fierce, and full of fire; the head is &s;mall, and the no&s;e
flat, though covered with very large &s;cales, of a yel|lowi&s;h a&s;h-colour;
the &s;kin is white, and the large tumour on the neck is flat, and covered with
oblong, &s;mooth &s;cales. The bite of this animal is &s;aid to be incurable,
the patient dying in about an hour after the wound; the whole frame being
di&s;&s;olved into one putrid ma&s;s of corruption.</P>
<P>To remedy the bite of all the&s;e animals, per|haps &s;allad-oil
would be very efficacious: how|ever the Indians make u&s;e of a compo&s;ition,
which is called, in Europe, Petro de Cobra, or the Serpent Stone; and which,
applied to the wound, is &s;aid to draw out the venom. The compo&s;ition of
this &s;tone, for it is an artificial &s;ub&s;tance, is kept a &s;ecret; and
perhaps its <PB N="217" REF="224"> effects in extracting the venom may be
ima|ginary: neverthele&s;s, it is certain that it has a power of &s;ticking to
the &s;kin, and &s;ucking a part of the blood from the wound. This it may do
&s;omewhat in the &s;ame manner as we &s;ee a tobacco-pipe &s;tick to the lips
of a man who is &s;moking: yet &s;till we are ignorant of the man|ner; and the
&s;ecret might probably be of &s;ome u&s;e in medicine. It were to be wi&s;hed,
there|fore, that tho&s;e who go into India would examine into this
compo&s;ition, and give us the re&s;ult of their enquiries: but I fear that it
is not to be|nefit mankind, that our travellers now go to India.</P>

<PB N="218" REF="225">
<HEAD>CHAP. X. Of Serpents without Venom.</HEAD>
<P>THE cla&s;s of &s;erpents without poi&s;on, may be
di&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e that are venomous, by their wanting the fang
teeth: their heads al&s;o are not &s;o thick in proportion to their bodies;
and, in general, they taper off to the tail more gradually in a point. But
notwith&s;tanding their being de&s;titute of venom, they do not cea&s;e to be
formidable: &s;ome grow to a &s;ize by which they become the mo&s;t powerful
animals of the fore&s;t; and even the &s;malle&s;t and mo&s;t harmle&s;s of
this &s;lender tribe, find protection from the &s;imilitude of their form.</P>
<P>The fangs make the great di&s;tinction among &s;erpents; and all
this tribe are without them. Their teeth are &s;hort, numerous, and, in the
&s;maller kinds, perfectly inoffen&s;ive: they lie in either jaw, as in frogs
and fi&s;hes, their points bending backwards, the better to &s;ecure their
prey. They want that artificial mechani&s;m by which the poi&s;onous tribe
inflict &s;uch deadly wounds: they have no gland in the head for preparing
venom; no conduits for conveying it to the teeth; no receptables there; no
hollow <PB N="219" REF="226"> in the in&s;trument that inflicts the wound.
Their bite, when the teeth happen to be large enough to penetrate the &s;kin,
for in general they are too &s;mall for this purpo&s;e, is attended with no
other &s;ymptoms than tho&s;e of an ordinary puncture; and many of this tribe,
as if &s;en&s;ible of their own impotence, cannot be provoked to bite, though
never &s;o rudely a&s;&s;aulted. They hi&s;s, dart out their forky tongues,
erect them|&s;elves on the tail, and call up all their terrors to intimidate
their aggre&s;&s;ors; but &s;eem to con|&s;ider their teeth as unnece&s;&s;ary
in&s;truments of defence, and never attempt to u&s;e them. Even among the
large&s;t of this kind, the teeth are never employed, in the mo&s;t de&s;perate
engage|ments. When a hare or a bird is caught, the teeth may &s;erve to prevent
&s;uch &s;mall game from e&s;caping; but when a buffalo or a tiger is to be
encountered, it is by the &s;trong folds of the body, by the fierce
verberations of the tail, that the enemy is de&s;troyed: by this twining round,
and drawing the knot with convul&s;ive energy, this enormous reptile breaks
every bone in the quadrupede's body, and then, at one mor|&s;el, devours its
prey.</P>
<P>From hence we may di&s;tingui&s;h the unve|nomous tribe into two
kinds: fir&s;t, into tho&s;e which are &s;eldom found of any con&s;iderable 
<PB N="220" REF="227"> magnitude, and that never offend animals larger or more
powerful than them&s;elves, but which find their chief protection in flight, or
in the doubtfulne&s;s of their form; &s;econdly, into &s;uch as grow to an
enormous &s;ize, fear no enemy, but indi&s;criminately attack all other animals
and devour them. Of the fir&s;t kind is the Common Black Snake, the Blind Worm,
the E&s;culapian Serpent, the Amphi&s;baena, and &s;everal others. Of the
&s;econd, the Lyboya, the Boiguacu, the Depona, and the Boiquatrara.</P>
<P>The Black Snake is the large&s;t of Engli&s;h &s;er|pents,
&s;ometimes exceeding four feet in length. The neck is &s;lender; the middle of
the body thick; the back and &s;ides covered with &s;mall &s;cales; the belly
with oblong, narrow, tran&s;ver&s;e plates: the colour of the back and &s;ides
are of a du&s;ky brown; the middle of the back marked with two rows of &s;mall
black &s;pots, running from the head to the tail; the plates on the belly are
du&s;ky; the &s;cales on the &s;ides are of a blui&s;h white: the teeth are
&s;mall and &s;errated, lying on each &s;ide of the jaw in two rows. The whole
&s;pecies is perfectly inoffen&s;ive; taking &s;helter in dung hills, and among
bu&s;hes in moi&s;t places; from whence they &s;eldom remove, un|le&s;s in the
mid&s;t of the day, in &s;ummer, when they are called out by the heat to ba&s;k
them&s;elves <PB N="221" REF="228"> in the &s;un. If di&s;turbed or attacked,
they move away among the brambles with great &s;wiftne&s;s; but if too
clo&s;ely pur&s;ued, they hi&s;s and threaten, and thus render them&s;elves
formidable, though incapable of offending.</P>
<P>The black &s;nake preys upon frogs, in&s;ects, worms, mice, and
young birds; and, con&s;idering the &s;mallne&s;s of the neck, it is amazing
how large an animal it will &s;wallow. The black &s;nake of Virginia, which is
larger than our's, and generally grows to &s;ix feet long, takes a prey
proportionable to its &s;ize; partridges, chickens, and young ducks. It is
generally found in the neighbourhood of the hen roo&s;t, and will devour the
eggs even while the hen is &s;itting upon them: the&s;e it &s;wallows whole;
and often, after it has done the mi&s;chief, will coil it&s;elf round in the
ne&s;t.</P>
<P>The whole of this tribe are oviparous, ex|cluding eighty or an
hundred eggs at a time, which are laid in dung-hills or hot-beds; the heat of
which, aided by that of the &s;un, brings them to maturity. During winter they
lie tor|pid, in banks of hedges, and under old trees.</P>
<P>The Blind Worm is another harmle&s;s reptile, with a formidable
appearance. The u&s;ual length of this &s;pecies is eleven inches. The eyes are
red; the head &s;mall; the neck &s;till more &s;lender: <PB N="222" REF="229">
from that part the body grows &s;uddenly, and continues of an equal bulk to the
tail, which ends quite blunt: the colour of the back is ci|nereous, marked with
very &s;mall lines, compo&s;ed of minute black &s;pecks; the &s;ides are of a
red|di&s;h ca&s;t; the belly du&s;ky, and marked like the back. The motion of
this &s;erpent is &s;low; from which, and from the &s;mallne&s;s of the eyes,
are derived its names; &s;ome calling it the Slow, and &s;ome the Blind Worm.
Like all the re&s;t of the kind in our climates, they lie torpid during winter;
and are &s;ometimes found, in va&s;t num|bers, twi&s;ted together. This animal,
like the former, is perfectly innocent; however, like the viper, it brings
forth its young alive. Ge&s;ner tells us, that one of the&s;e being &s;truck on
the head when it was pregnant, it immediately ca&s;t forth its young.</P>
<P>The Amphi&s;baena, or the Double Headed Serpent, is remarkable
for moving along with either the head or the tail foremo&s;t; and from thence
it has been thought to have two heads. This error took its ri&s;e from the
thickne&s;s of the tail, which, at a di&s;tance, may be mi&s;taken for another
head. Upon a nearer view, however, the error is ea&s;ily di&s;covered, and the
animal will be found formed according to the u&s;ual cour&s;e of nature. It is
as thick at one end as <PB N="223" REF="230"> at the other; and the colour of
the &s;kin is like that of the earth, being rough, hard, and va|riou&s;ly
&s;potted. Some have affirmed that its bite is dangerous; but this mu&s;t be a
mi&s;take, as it wants the fangs, and con&s;equently the ela|boratory that
prepares the poi&s;on.</P>
<P>The&s;e animals are only formidable from their &s;imilitude to
the viper tribe; and, in &s;ome coun|tries, where &s;uch reptiles are common,
they make the di&s;tinction &s;o exactly, that while they de&s;troy &s;erpents
of one kind with great ani|mo&s;ity, they take others into their hou&s;es, and
even into their bo&s;oms, with a kind of unac|countable affection. The
E&s;culapian Serpent of Italy is among this number. It is there &s;uf|fered to
crawl about the chambers; and often gets into the beds where people lie. It is
a yel|low &s;erpent, of about an ell long; and though innocent, yet will bite
when exa&s;perated. They are &s;aid to be great de&s;troyers of mice; and this
may be the rea&s;on why they are taken under human protection. The Boyuna of
Ceylon is equally a favourite among the natives; and they con&s;ider the
meeting it as a &s;ign of good luck. The Surinam Serpent, which &s;ome
improperly call the Ammodytes, is equally harmle&s;s and de&s;irable among the
&s;avages of that part of the world. They con&s;ider them&s;elves as extremely 
<PB N="224" REF="231"> happy if this animal comes into their huts. The colours
of this &s;erpent are &s;o many and beautiful, that they &s;urpa&s;s all
de&s;cription; and the&s;e per|haps are the chief inducements to the &s;avages
to con&s;ider its vi&s;its as &s;o very fortunate. A &s;till greater favourite
is the Prince of Serpents, a native of Japan, that has not its equal for
beauty. The &s;cales which cover the back are reddi&s;h, finely &s;haded, and
marbled with large &s;pots of irregular figures mixed with black. The fore part
of the head is covered with large beautiful &s;cales, the jaws bordered with
yellow, the fore|head marked with a black marbled &s;treak, and the eyes
hand&s;ome and lively. But of all others, the Gerenda of the Ea&s;t Indies is
the mo&s;t ho|noured and e&s;teemed. To this animal, which is finely &s;potted
with various colours, the natives of Calicut pay divine honours; and while
their deity lies coiled up, which is its u&s;ual po&s;ture, the people fall
upon their faces before it with &s;tupid adoration. The African Gerenda is
larger, and wor&s;hiped in the &s;ame manner, by the inhabitants of the
coa&s;ts of Mozambique. The &s;kin is not &s;o finely &s;potted as the former;
but it is variegated all over the body with very fine white, a&s;h coloured,
and black &s;pots. The brilliancy of colouring in the&s;e reptiles would only
&s;erve with us to encrea&s;e our di&s;gu&s;t; but <PB N="225" REF="232"> in
tho&s;e countries where they are, common di&s;tinctions are made; and even in
this horrid cla&s;s, there are &s;ome eyes that can di&s;cover beauty.</P>
<P>But in the larger tribe of &s;erpents, there is nothing but
danger to be apprehended. This formidable cla&s;s, though without venom, have
&s;omething frightful in their colour, as well as their &s;ize and form. They
want that vivid hue with which the &s;avages are &s;o much plea&s;ed in the
le&s;&s;er kinds; they are all found of a du&s;ky colour, with large teeth,
which are more for|midable than dangerous.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of this cla&s;s, is the Great Jiboya of Java and
Bra&s;il, which Leguat affirms, he has &s;een fifty feet long. Nor is he
&s;ingular in this report, as many of the mi&s;&s;ionaries affirm the &s;ame;
and we have the concurrent te&s;timony of hi&s;torians as a further proof. The
large&s;t ani|mal of this kind, which has been brought into Europe, is but
thirty-&s;ix feet long; and it is probable, that much greater have been &s;een
and de&s;troyed, before they were thought worth &s;ending &s;o far, to
&s;atisfy European curio&s;ity. The mo&s;t u&s;ual length, however, of the
jiboya, is about twenty feet, and the thickne&s;s in pro|portion. The teeth are
&s;mall in proportion to <PB N="226" REF="233"> the body; nor are they u&s;ed,
but when it &s;eizes the &s;malle&s;t prey. It lies in wait for wild ani|mals
near the paths, and when it throws it&s;elf upon them, it wraps them round &s;o
clo&s;ely as to break all the bones; then moi&s;tening the whole body over with
its &s;laver, it makes it fit for deglutition, and &s;wallows it whole.</P>
<P>The Boiguacu is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the next in magnitude, and
has often been &s;een to &s;wallow a goat whole. It is thicke&s;t in the middle
of the body, and grows &s;horter and &s;maller towards the head and the tail:
on the middle of the back, there is a chain of &s;mall black &s;pots running
along the length of it; and on each &s;ide, there are large round black
&s;pots, at &s;ome di&s;tance from each other, which are white in the center:
between the&s;e, near the belly, there are two rows of le&s;&s;er black
&s;pots, which run parallel to the back. It has a double row of &s;harp teeth
in each jaw, of a white colour, and &s;hining like mother-of pearl. The head is
broad; and over the eyes it is rai&s;ed into two prominences: near the
extremity of the tail there are two claws, re&s;embling tho&s;e of birds.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;erpents lie hid in thickets, from whence they &s;ally
out unawares, and rai&s;ing them&s;elves upright on their tails, will attack
both men and <PB N="227" REF="234"> bea&s;ts. They make a loud hi&s;&s;ing
noi&s;e when exa&s;perated; and &s;ometimes winding up trees, will dart down
upon travellers, and twi&s;t them|&s;elves &s;o clo&s;ely round their bodies,
as to di&s;patch them in a very few minutes. Condamine, how|ever, affirms, that
their bite is not dangerous; for though the teeth are &s;o large, as to
in&s;pire the beholder with terror, yet the wound they make is attended with no
dangerous con&s;e|quences whatever. Dellon affirms, that they generally haunt
de&s;art places; and though they are &s;ometimes &s;een near great towns, or on
the banks of rivers, yet it is generally after &s;ome great inundation: he
never &s;aw any but what were dead; and they appeared to him, like the trunk of
a great tree lying on the ground.</P>
<P>To this cla&s;s of large &s;erpents, we may refer the Depona, a
native of Mexico, with a very large head and great jaws. The mouth is armed
with cutting, crooked teeth, among which there are two longer than the re&s;t,
placed in the fore part of the upper jaw, but very different from the fangs of
the viper. All round the mouth there is a broad &s;caly border; and the eyes
are &s;o large, that they give it a very terrible a&s;pect. The forehead is
covered with very large &s;cales; <PB N="228" REF="235"> on which are placed
others, that are &s;maller, curiou&s;ly ranged: tho&s;e on the back are
greyi&s;h, and along it runs a double chain, who&s;e ends are joined in the
manner of a buckler. Each &s;ide of the belly is marbled with large &s;quare
&s;pots, of a che&s;nut colour; in the middle of which is a &s;pot, which is
round and yellow. They avoid the &s;ight of man; and con&s;equently, never do
much harm.</P>
<P>Such are the mo&s;t noted animals of the &s;er|pent tribe: but
to recount all, would be a vain, as well as a u&s;ele&s;s endeavour. In tho&s;e
coun|tries where they abound, their di&s;criminations are &s;o numerous, and
their colours &s;o various, that every thicket &s;eems to produce a new
ani|mal. The &s;ame &s;erpent is often found to bring forth animals of eight or
ten different colours: and the naturali&s;t who attempts to arrange them by
that mark, will find that he has made di|&s;tinctions which are entirely
di&s;owned by Nature: however, a very con&s;iderable number might be added to
enlarge the catalogue; but having &s;upplied a general hi&s;tory, the mind
turns away from a &s;ubject where every object pre&s;ents &s;omething
formidable or loath&s;ome to the imagination. Indeed, the whole tribe
re&s;emble each other &s;o nearly, that the hi&s;tory of one 
<PB N="229" REF="236"> may almo&s;t &s;erve for every other. They are all
terrible to the imagination, all frightful to behold in their fury, and have
long been con|&s;idered as a race of animals between whom and man there is a
natural antipathy.</P>

<HEAD>AN HISTORY OF INSECTS.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of In&s;ects in general.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING gone through the upper ranks of nature, we de&s;cend to
that of in&s;ects, a &s;ubject almo&s;t inexhau&s;tible from the number of its
tribes and the variety of their appearance. Tho&s;e who have profe&s;&s;edly
written on this &s;ubject &s;eem to con&s;ider it as one of the greate&s;t that
can occupy the human mind, as the mo&s;t plea&s;ing in animated nature. 
<Q REND="inline">"After an attentive examination," &s;ays
Swammerdam, "of the nature and anatomy of the &s;malle&s;t as well as the
large&s;t animals, I cannot help al|lowing the lea&s;t an equal, or perhaps a
&s;u|perior, degree of dignity. If, while we di&s;&s;ect with care the larger
animals, we are filled <PB N="234" REF="239"> with wonder at the elegant
di&s;po&s;ition of their parts, to what an height is our a&s;toni&s;h|ment
rai&s;ed, when we di&s;cover all the&s;e parts arranged in the lea&s;t in the
&s;ame regular manner! Notwith&s;tanding the &s;mallne&s;s of ants, nothing
hinders our preferring them to the large&s;t animals. If we con&s;ider either
their unwearied diligence, their wonderful &s;trength, or their inimitable
propen&s;ity to labour. Their amazing love to their young is &s;till more
unparalleled among the larger cla&s;&s;es. They not only daily carry them to
&s;uch places as may afford them food; but if by accident they are killed, and
even cut into pieces, they, with the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s, will carry them
away piecemeal in their arms. Who can &s;hew &s;uch an example among the larger
animals, which are dignified with the title of perfect? Who can find an
in&s;tance in any other creature that can come in compe|tition with
this?"</Q></P>
<P>Such is the language of a man who by long &s;tudy became
enamoured of his &s;ubject; but to tho&s;e who judge le&s;s partially, it will
be found that the in&s;ect tribe, for every rea&s;on, de&s;erve but the la&s;t
and lowe&s;t rank in animated nature. As in mechanics the mo&s;t complicated
machines are required to perform the nice&s;t operations, &s;o in 
<PB N="235" REF="240"> anatomy the noble&s;t animals are mo&s;t variou&s;ly and
wonderfully made. Of all living beings, man offers the mo&s;t wonderful variety
in his internal conformation; quadrupedes come next; and other animals follow
in proportion to their powers or their excellencies. In&s;ects &s;eem of all
others the mo&s;t imperfectly formed: from their minutene&s;s, the
di&s;&s;ecting knife can go but a &s;hort way in the inve&s;tigation; but one
thing argues an evident imperfection, which is, that many of them can live a
long time, though deprived of tho&s;e organs which are nece&s;&s;ary to life in
the higher ranks of nature. Many of them are furni&s;hed with lungs and an
heart like nobler animals; yet the caterpillar con|tinues to live, though its
heart and lungs, which is often the ca&s;e, are entirely eaten away.</P>
<P>But it is not from their conformation alone that in&s;ects are
inferior to other animals, but from their in&s;tincts al&s;o. It is true, that
the ant and the bee pre&s;ent us with very &s;triking in&s;tances of
a&s;&s;iduity; but how far are theirs beneath the marks of &s;agacity exhibited
in the hound or the &s;tag! A bee taken from the &s;warm is totally helple&s;s
and inactive, inca|pable of giving the &s;malle&s;t variation to its
in|&s;tincts: it has but one &s;ingle method of ope|rating, and, if put from
that, it can turn to <PB N="236" REF="241"> no other. In the pur&s;uits of the
hound, there is &s;omething like a choice; in the labours of the bee, the whole
appears like nece&s;&s;ity or compul&s;ion.</P>
<P>If in&s;ects be con&s;idered as bearing a relation to man, and
as a&s;&s;i&s;ting him in the plea&s;ures or nece&s;&s;ities of life, they
will, even in this re&s;pect, &s;ink in the compari&s;on with the larger tribes
of nature. It is true, that the bee, the &s;ilk-worm, the cochineal fly, and
the cantharides, render him &s;ignal &s;ervices; but how many others of this
cla&s;s, are either noxious, or totally un&s;erviceable to him. Even in a
country like ours, where all the noxious animals have been reduced by repeated
a&s;&s;iduity, the in&s;ect tribes &s;till maintain their ground, and are but
too often unwelcome intruders upon the fruits of human indu&s;try. But in more
uncultivated re|gions, their annoyance and deva&s;tations are ter|rible. What
an uncomfortable life mu&s;t the natives lead in Lapland, and &s;ome parts of
America, where, if a candle be lighted, the in|&s;ects &s;warm in &s;uch
abundance, as in&s;tantly to extingui&s;h it with their numbers; where the
in|habitants are obliged to &s;mear their bodies and faces with tar, or &s;ome
other compo&s;ition, to protect them from-the puncture of their minute enemies;
where, though millions are de&s;troyed, <PB N="237" REF="242"> fami&s;hed
millions are &s;till &s;een to &s;ucceed, and to make the torture
endle&s;s!</P>
<P>Their amazing number is al&s;o an argument of their
imperfection. It is a rule that obtains through all nature, that the nobler
animals are &s;lowly produced, and that nature acts with a kind of dignified
economy; but the meaner births are lavi&s;hed in profu&s;ion, and thou&s;ands
are brought forth merely to &s;upply the nece&s;|&s;ities of the more favourite
objects of creation. Of all other productions in nature, in&s;ects are the
mo&s;t numerous. Vegetables that cover the &s;urface of the earth bear no
proportion to their multitudes; and though at fir&s;t &s;ight herbs of the
field &s;eem to be the parts of organized na|ture produced in the greate&s;t
abundance, yet, upon minuter in&s;pection, we &s;hall find every plant
&s;upporting a number of &s;carce perceptible creatures, that fill up the
various &s;tages of youth, vigour, and age, in the compa&s;s of a few days
exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>All other animals are capable of &s;ome degree of education;
their in&s;tincts may be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed or altered; the dog may be taught to
fetch and carry; the bird to whi&s;tle a tune; and the &s;erpent to dance: but
the in&s;ect has but one in|variable method of operating; no arts can turn it
from its in&s;tincts; and indeed its life is too <PB N="238" REF="243"> &s;hort
for in&s;truction, as a &s;ingle &s;ea&s;on often terminates its
exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>For the&s;e rea&s;ons, the in&s;ect tribe are de|&s;ervedly
placed in the lowe&s;t rank of animated nature; and, in general, they &s;eem
more allied to the vegetables on which they feed than to the nobler cla&s;&s;es
above them. Many of them are attached to one vegetable, often to a &s;ingle
leaf; there they encrea&s;e with the flouri&s;hing plant, and die as it decays;
a few days fill up the mea&s;ure of their contemptible lives; while the ends
for which they were produced, or the plea&s;ures they enjoyed, to us at
lea&s;t, are utterly unknown.</P>
<P>Yet while I am thus fixing the rank of a certain cla&s;s of
animals, it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to define the nature of tho&s;e animals which
are thus degraded. Definitions in general produce little knowledge; but here
where the &s;hades of nature are &s;o intimately blended, &s;ome
di&s;cri|mination is nece&s;&s;ary to prevent confu&s;ion. The &s;mallne&s;s of
the animal, for in&s;tance, does not con&s;titute an in&s;ect; for then, many
of the lizard kind, which are not above two inches long, would come under this
denomination; and if the &s;maller lizards, why not the crocodile, which would
be a terrible in&s;ect indeed? In the &s;ame manner, &s;mallne&s;s, with a
&s;low creeping <PB N="239" REF="244"> motion, does not con&s;titute an
in&s;ect; for, though &s;nails might be called in&s;ects with the &s;ame
propriety, the whole tribe of &s;ea &s;hell-fi&s;h would then have equal
preten&s;ions, and a very trouble&s;ome innovation would be brought into our
language, which is already formed. Ex|cluding &s;uch animals, therefore, from
the in&s;ect tribe, we may define in&s;ects to be <HI>little animals without
red blood, bones or cartilages, furni&s;hed with a trunk, or el&s;e a mouth,
opening lengthwi&s;e, with eyes which they are incapable of covering, and with
lungs which have their openings on the &s;ides.</HI> This definition
comprehends the whole cla&s;s of in&s;ects, whether with or without wings,
whether in their caterpillar or butterfly &s;tate, whether produced in the
ordinary method of generation between male and female, or from an animal that
is it&s;elf both male and female, or from the &s;ame animal cut into &s;everal
parts, and each part reproducing a perfect animal.</P>
<P>From hence it appears, that in this cla&s;s of animals there
are numerous di&s;tinctions, and that a general de&s;cription will by no means
&s;erve for all. Almo&s;t every &s;pecies has its own di|&s;tinct hi&s;tory;
and exhibits manners, appetites, and modes of propagation, peculiarly its own.
In the larger ranks of exi&s;tence, two animals that nearly re&s;emble each
other in form will be <PB N="240" REF="245"> found to have a &s;imilar
hi&s;tory; but here in&s;ects almo&s;t entirely alike will be often found
per|fectly di&s;&s;imilar, as well in their manner of bringing forth and
&s;ub&s;i&s;ting as in the changes which they undergo during their &s;hort
lives. Thus as this cla&s;s is prolific beyond computa|tion, &s;o are its
varieties multiplied beyond the power of de&s;cription. The attempt to
enume|rate all the &s;pecies of a fly or a moth would be very fruitle&s;s; but
to give an hi&s;tory of all would be utterly impracticable; &s;o various are
the appetites, the manners, and the lives of this humble cla&s;s of beings,
that every &s;pecies re|quires its di&s;tinct hi&s;tory. An exact plan,
there|fore, of Nature's operations in this minute &s;et of creatures is not to
be expected; and yet &s;uch a general picture may be given, as is &s;ufficient
to &s;hew the protection which Providence affords its &s;malle&s;t as well as
its large&s;t productions, and to di&s;play that admirable circulation in
nature by which one &s;et of living beings find &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence from the
de&s;truction of another; and by which life is continued without a pau&s;e in
every part of the creation.</P>
<P>Upon ca&s;ting a &s;light view over the whole in&s;ect tribe
ju&s;t when they are &s;uppo&s;ed to rouze from their &s;tate of annual
torpidity, when they begin to feel the genial influence of &s;pring, and again
exhibit new life in every part of nature, <PB N="241" REF="246"> their numbers
and their varieties &s;eem to exceed all powers of calculation, and they are
indeed too great for de&s;cription. When we look clo&s;er, however, we &s;hall
find &s;ome &s;triking &s;imilitudes, either in their propagation, their
manners, or their form, that give us a hint for grouping &s;everal of them into
one de&s;cription, and thus enabling us to &s;horten the labour of a &s;eparate
hi&s;tory for every &s;pecies. Swammerdam, Reau|mur, and Linnaeus, have each
attempted to abridge the ta&s;k of de&s;cription, by throwing a number of
&s;imilar animals into di&s;tinct cla&s;&s;es, and thus making one general
hi&s;tory &s;tand for all. I will avail my&s;elf of their labours; and uniting
their general di&s;tinctions, throw the whole cla&s;s of in&s;ects into four
&s;eparate di&s;tri|butions, giving under each the hi&s;tory of every &s;pecies
that &s;eems to me con&s;iderable enough to de&s;erve our notice. Thus our
labour will be &s;hortened; and the very rank in which an in&s;ect is placed
will, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, exhibit a con|&s;iderable part of its hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>In our cur&s;ory in&s;pection of the in&s;ect tribe, the
fir&s;t animals that offer them&s;elves are tho&s;e which want wings, that
appear crawling about on every plant, and on every &s;pot of earth we regard
with any degree of attention. Of the&s;e, &s;ome never obtain wings at any
period of their <PB N="242" REF="247"> exi&s;tence, but are de&s;tined to creep
on the ve|getable, or the &s;pot of earth where they are &s;tationed, for their
whole lives. On the con|trary, others are only candidates for a more happy
&s;ituation; and only wait their growing wings, when they may be &s;aid to
arrive at their &s;tate of full perfection.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that never have wings, but creep about till they die,
may be con&s;idered as con&s;tituting the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> cla&s;s of
in&s;ects. All the&s;e, the flea and the wood-lou&s;e only excepted, are
produced from an egg; and when once they break the &s;hell, they never &s;uffer
any further change of form, but continue to grow larger till they die. Thus the
lou&s;e or the &s;pider are produced from an egg, never &s;uffering any
alteration when once they are ex|cluded; but, like the chicken or the duck,
remaining invariably the &s;ame, from their birth to their di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>The &s;econd order of in&s;ects con&s;i&s;ts of &s;uch as have
wings; but which, when produced from the egg, have tho&s;e wings ca&s;ed up in
&s;uch a manner as not to appear. This ca&s;ing up of the wing, however, does
not prevent the ani|mal's running, leaping, and moving with its natural
celerity; but when the ca&s;e bur&s;ts, and the wings have a power of
expanding, all <PB N="243" REF="248"> the animal's motions become more
exten&s;ive, and the animal arrives at full perfection. Thus the gra&s;shopper,
the dragon fly, and the ear|wig, have their wings at fir&s;t bound down; but
when the &s;kin that, like a pair of &s;tays, kept them confined, bur&s;ts,
they are then expanded, and the animal pur&s;ues the purpo&s;es for which it
was produced.</P>
<P>The third order of in&s;ects is of the moth and butterfly
kind. The&s;e all have four wings, each covered with a mealy &s;ub&s;tance of
various co|lours, which when handled comes off upon the fingers; and, if
examined by the micro&s;cope, will appear like &s;cales, with which the wing is
nicely embroidered all over. The&s;e in&s;ects al&s;o are produced in a manner
peculiar to them|&s;elves. They are fir&s;t hatched from an egg, from whence
proceeds a caterpillar that eats, and often ca&s;ts its &s;kin; the caterpillar
having dive&s;ted it&s;elf for the la&s;t time, a&s;&s;umes a new covering,
which is called a chry&s;alis, or the cone in the &s;ilk-worm, in which it
continues hidden till it comes forth a perfect moth or butterfly.</P>
<P>The fourth order is of tho&s;e winged in&s;ects which come
from a worm in&s;tead of a cater|pillar, and yet go through changes &s;imilar
to <PB N="244" REF="249"> tho&s;e which moths and butterflies are &s;een to
undergo. They are fir&s;t excluded from the egg as a worm, and then become a
chry&s;alis; in &s;ome, their wings and legs are &s;een; in others, the animal
is quite detached from the cone in which it is concealed; but all at length
break their pri&s;on, and come out perfect winged ani|mals; &s;ome furni&s;hed
with two wings and &s;ome with four. The wings of all the&s;e differ from
tho&s;e of the butterfly and moth kind, by not having the mealy &s;cales which
are ever found on the wings of the former. In this cla&s;s we may place the
numerous tribes of gnats, beetles, bees, and flies.</P>
<P>To the&s;e I will add, as a fifth order, a nu|merous tribe
lately di&s;covered, to which na|turali&s;ts have given the name of Zoophytes.
The&s;e do not go through the ordinary forms of generation, but may be
propagated by di&s;&s;ection. Some of the&s;e, though cut into an hundred
parts, &s;till retain life in each, and are endued with &s;uch a vivacious
principle, that every part will in a &s;hort time become a perfect animal. They
&s;eem a &s;et of creatures placed between animals and vegetables, and make the
&s;hade that connects animated and in&s;en&s;ible nature. To this cla&s;s
belong the polypus, the earth|worm, and all the varieties of the
&s;ea-nettle.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="250">Having thus given a general
di&s;tribution of in&s;ects, I will poceed to de&s;cribe each cla&s;s in the
order I have mentioned them; beginning with in&s;ects without wings, as they
more nearly re&s;emble the higher ranks of nature, as well in their habits as
their conformation.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of In&s;ects without Wings.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY moment's ob&s;ervation furni&s;hes us with in&s;tances
of in&s;ects without wings; but the difficulty is to di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e
which are con|demned continually to lead reptile lives, from &s;uch as only
wait the happy moment of tran&s;|mutation. For this, nothing but a long and
intimate acquaintance will &s;uffice; but, in ge|neral, all animals
re&s;embling the flea, the lou&s;e, the &s;pider, the bug, the wood-lou&s;e,
the water-lou&s;e, and the &s;corpion, never acquire wings, but are produced
from the egg in that form which they never change afterwards.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider this cla&s;s as di&s;tinct from others, we
&s;hall find them in general longer lived than the re&s;t, and often continuing
their term beyond one &s;ea&s;on, which is the ordinary period of an in&s;ect's
exi&s;tence. They &s;eem al&s;o le&s;s &s;ubject to the influence of the
weather; and often endure the rigours of winter without being numbed into
torpidity. The whole race of moths, butterflies, bees, and flies, are ren|dered
lifele&s;s by the return of cold weather; but we need not be told, that the
lou&s;e, the flea, <PB N="247" REF="252"> and many of the&s;e wingle&s;s
creatures that &s;eem formed to teize mankind, continue their painful
depredations the whole year round.</P>
<P>They come to perfection in the egg, as was &s;aid before; and
it &s;ometimes happens, that when the animal is interrupted in performing the
offices of exclu&s;ion, the young ones bur&s;t the &s;hell within the parent's
body, and are thus brought forth alive. This not unfre|quently happens with the
wood-lou&s;e, and others of the kind, which are &s;ometimes &s;een producing
eggs, and &s;ometimes young ones perfectly formed.</P>
<P>Though the&s;e creatures are perfect from the beginning, yet
they are often, during their ex|i&s;tence, &s;een to change their &s;kin: this
is a fa|culty which they po&s;&s;e&s;s in common with many of the higher ranks
of animals, and which an&s;wers the &s;ame purpo&s;es. However tender their
&s;kins may &s;eem to our feel, yet, if com|pared to the animal's &s;trength
and &s;ize, they will be found to re&s;emble a coat of mail or, to talk more
clo&s;ely, the &s;hell of a lob&s;ter. By this &s;kin the&s;e animals are
defended from accidental injuries, and particularly from the attacks of each
other. Within this they continue to grow, till their bodies become &s;o large
as to be im|pri&s;oned in their own covering, and then the 
<PB N="248" REF="253"> &s;hell bur&s;ts, but is quickly replaced by a new
one.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, the&s;e animals are endued with a de|gree of
&s;trength for their &s;ize, that at fir&s;t might exceed
credibility.&mdash;Had man an equal degree of &s;trength, bulk for bulk, with a
lou&s;e or flea, the hi&s;tory of Sam&s;on would be no longer
miraculous.&mdash;A flea will draw a chain an hundred times heavier than
it&s;elf; and to compen&s;ate for this force, will eat ten times its own &s;ize
of provi&s;ion in a &s;ingle day.</P>

<P><PB N="249" REF="255">THE animal that de&s;erves our fir&s;t
notice in this principal order of in&s;ects is the &s;pider, who&s;e manners
are of all others the mo&s;t &s;ubtle, and who&s;e in&s;tincts are mo&s;t
various. Formed for a life of rapacity, and incapable of living upon any other
than in&s;ect food, all its habits are calculated to deceive and &s;urprize; it
&s;preads toils to entangle its prey; it is endued with patience to expect its
coming; and is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of arms and &s;trength to de&s;troy it when
fallen into the &s;nare.</P>
<P>In this country, where all the in&s;ect tribes are kept under
by human a&s;&s;iduity, the &s;piders are but &s;mall and harmle&s;s. We are
acquainted with few, but the hou&s;e-&s;pider, which weaves its web in
neglected rooms; the garden-&s;pider, that &s;preads its toils from tree to
tree, and re&s;ts in the center; the wandering-&s;pider, that has no abode like
the re&s;t; and the field &s;pider, that is &s;ometimes &s;een mounting, web
and all, into the clouds. The&s;e are the chief of our native &s;piders; which,
though reputed venom|ous, are entirely inoffen&s;ive. But they form 
<PB N="250" REF="256"> a much more terrible tribe in Africa and Ame|rica. In
tho&s;e regions, where all the in&s;ect &s;pecies acquire their greate&s;t
growth, where the butterfly is &s;een to expand a wing as broad as our
&s;parrow, and the ant to build an habita|tion as tall as a man, it is not to
be wondered at that the &s;piders are &s;een bearing a propor|tionable
magnitude. In fact, the bottom of the Martinico &s;pider's body is as large as
a hen's egg, and covered all over with hair. Its web is &s;trong, and its bite
dangerous. It is happy for us, however, that we are placed at a di&s;tance from
the&s;e formidable creatures, and that we can examine their hi&s;tory without
feeling their re&s;entment.</P>
<P>Every &s;pider has two divi&s;ions in its body. The fore-part,
containing the head and brea&s;t, is &s;eparated from the hinder part or belly
by a very &s;lender thread, through which, however, there is communication from
one part to the other. The fore part is covered with a hard &s;hell, as well as
the legs, which adhere to the brea&s;t. The hinder part is cloathed with a
&s;upple &s;kin, be&s;et all over with hair. They have &s;everal eyes all round
the head, brilliant and acute; the&s;e are &s;ometimes eight in number,
&s;ometimes but &s;ix; two behind, two before, and the re&s;t on each &s;ide.
Like <PB N="251" REF="257"> all other in&s;ects, their eyes are immoveable; and
they want eye-lids; but this organ is fortified with a tran&s;parent horny
&s;ub&s;tance, which at once &s;ecures and a&s;&s;i&s;ts their vi&s;ion. As the
animal procures its &s;ub&s;i&s;tence by the mo&s;t watchful attention, &s;o
large a number of eyes was nece&s;&s;ary to give it the earlie&s;t information
of the capture of its prey. They have two pincers on the fore-part of the head,
rough, with &s;trong points, toothed like a &s;aw, and ter|minating in claws
like tho&s;e of a cat. A little below the point of the claw there is a &s;mall
hole, through which the animal emits a poi&s;on, which, though harmle&s;s to
us, is &s;ufficiently capable of in&s;tantly de&s;troying its prey. This is the
mo&s;t powerful weapon they have again&s;t their enemies; they can open or
extend the&s;e pincers as occa&s;ion may require; and when they are
undi&s;turbed, they &s;uffer them to lie one upon the other, never opening them
but when there is a nece&s;&s;ity for their exertion. They have all eight legs,
jointed like tho&s;e of lob&s;ters, and &s;imilar al&s;o in another re&s;pect;
for if a leg be torn away, or a joint cut off, a new one will quickly grow in
its place, and the animal will find it&s;elf fitted for combat as be|fore. At
the end of each leg there are three crooked moveable claws; namely, a &s;mall
one, <PB N="252" REF="258"> placed higher up, like a cock's &s;pur, by the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of which it adheres to the threads of its web. There are two
others larger, which meet together like a lob&s;ter's claw, by which they can
catch hold of the &s;malle&s;t depre&s;&s;ions, walking up or down the very
poli&s;hed &s;urfaces, on which they can find inequalities that are
imperceptible to our gro&s;&s;er &s;ight. But when they walk upon &s;uch bodies
as are perfectly &s;mooth, as looking gla&s;s or poli&s;hed marble, they
&s;queeze a little &s;ponge, which grows near the extremity of their claws, and
thus diffu&s;ing a glutinous &s;ub&s;tance, adhere to the &s;urface until they
make a &s;econd &s;tep. Be&s;ides the eight legs ju&s;t mentioned, the&s;e
animals have two others, which may more properly be called arms, as they do not
&s;erve to a&s;&s;i&s;t motion, but are u&s;ed in holding and managing their
prey.</P>
<P>The &s;pider, though thus formidably equipped, would &s;eldom
prove &s;ucce&s;sful in the capture, were it not equally furni&s;hed with other
in&s;tru|ments to a&s;&s;i&s;t its depredations. As it lives wholly upon flies,
and is without wings to pur&s;ue them, it is obvious they mu&s;t for ever
e&s;cape &s;o impotent an adver&s;ary; but the &s;pider is a mo&s;t experienced
hunter, and &s;preads its nets to catch tho&s;e animals it is unable to
pur|&s;ue. The &s;pider's web is generally laid in tho&s;e 
<PB N="253" REF="259"> places where flies are mo&s;t apt to come and &s;helter;
in the corners of rooms, round the edges of windows, and in the open air among
the branches of trees. There the little animal remains for days, nay weeks
together, in pa|tient expectation, &s;eldom changing its &s;ituation though
never &s;o un&s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>For the purpo&s;es of making this web, Na|ture has &s;upplied
this animal with a large quan|tity of glutinous matter within its body, and
five dugs or teats for &s;pinning it into thread. This &s;ub&s;tance is
contained in a little bag, and at fir&s;t &s;ight it re&s;embles &s;oft glue;
but when examined more accurately, it will be found twi&s;ted into many coils
of an agate colour, and upon breaking it, the contents may be ea&s;ily drawn
out into threads, from the tenacity of the &s;ub&s;tance, not from tho&s;e
threads being already formed. Tho&s;e who have &s;een the machine by which wire
is &s;pun, will have an idea of the manner in which this animal forms the
threads of its little net, the orifices of the five teats above-mentioned,
through which the thread is drawn, contracting or dilating at plea|&s;ure. The
threads which we &s;ee, and appear &s;o fine, are, notwith&s;tanding,
compo&s;ed of five joined together, and the&s;e are many times doubled when the
web is in formation.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="260">When a hou&s;e-&s;pider propo&s;es to
begin a web, it fir&s;t makes choice of &s;ome commo|dious &s;pot, where there
is an appearance of plunder and &s;ecurity. The animal then di&s;tils one
little drop of its glutinous liquor, which is very tenacious, and then creeping
up the wall, and joining its thread as it proceeds, it darts it&s;elf in a very
&s;urpri&s;ing manner, as I have often &s;een, to the oppo&s;ite place, where
the other end of the web is to be fa&s;tened. The fir&s;t thread thus formed,
drawn tight, and fixed at each end, the &s;pider then runs upon it backward and
forward, &s;till a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly em|ployed in doubling and &s;trengthening
it, as upon its force depends the &s;trength and &s;tabi|lity of the whole. The
&s;caffolding thus com|pleted, the &s;pider makes a number of threads parallel
to the fir&s;t, in the &s;ame manner, and then cro&s;&s;es them with others;
the clammy &s;ub&s;tance of which they are formed, &s;erving to bind them, when
newly made, to each other. The in&s;ect, after this operation, doubles and
trebles the thread that borders its web, by opening all its teats at once, and
&s;ecures the edges, &s;o as to prevent the wind from blow|ing the work away.
The edges being thus fortified, the retreat is next to be attended to; and this
is formed like a funnel at the bottom <PB N="255" REF="261"> of the web, where
the little creature lies con|cealed. To this are two pa&s;&s;ages, or outlets,
one above and the other below, very artfully contrived, to give the animal an
opportunity of making excur&s;ions at proper &s;ea&s;ons, of pry|ing into every
corner, and cleaning tho&s;e parts which are ob&s;erved to be clogged or
encum|bered. Still attentive to its web, the &s;pider, from time to time,
cleans away the du&s;t that gathers round it, which might otherwi&s;e clog and
incommode it: for this purpo&s;e, it gives the whole a &s;hake with its paws;
&s;till, however, proportioning the blow &s;o as not to endanger the fabric. It
often happens al&s;o, that from the main web there are &s;everal threads
extended at &s;ome di&s;tance on every &s;ide: the&s;e are, in &s;ome
mea&s;ure, the outworks of the fortification, which, whenever touched from
without, the &s;pider prepares for attack or &s;elf-defence. If the in&s;ect
impinging be a fly, it &s;prings for|ward with great agility; if, on the
contrary, it be the a&s;&s;ault of an enemy &s;tronger than it&s;elf, it keeps
within its fortre&s;s, and never ventures out till the danger be over. Another
advantage which the &s;pider reaps from this contrivance of a cell or retreat
behind the web, is, that it &s;erves for a place where the creature 
<PB N="256" REF="262"> can fea&s;t upon its game with all &s;afety, and conceal
the fragments of tho&s;e carca&s;&s;es which it has picked, without expo&s;ing
to public view the lea&s;t trace of barbarity, that might create a
&s;u&s;picion in any in&s;ects that their enemy was near.</P>
<P>It often happens, however, that the wind, or the ru&s;tling of
the branches, or the approach of &s;ome large animal, de&s;troys in a minute
the labours of an age. In this ca&s;e, the &s;pider is obliged to remain a
patient &s;pectator of the univer&s;al ruin; and when the danger is pa&s;&s;ed
away, it &s;ets about repairing the calamity. For this purpo&s;e, it is
furni&s;hed with a large &s;tore of the glutinous &s;ub&s;tance of which the
web is made; and with this, it either makes a new web, or patches up the old
one. In general, however, the animal is much fonder of mending than making, as
it is furni&s;hed originally with but a certain quantity of glu|tinous matter,
which, when exhau&s;ted, nothing can renew. The time &s;eldom fails to come,
when their re&s;ervoirs are entirely dried up, and the poor animal is left to
all the chances of irretrievable nece&s;&s;ity. An old &s;pider is thus
frequently reduced to the greate&s;t extremity; its web is de&s;troyed, and it
wants the materials <PB N="257" REF="263"> to make a new one. But as the&s;e
animals have been long accu&s;tomed to a life of &s;hift|ing, it hunts about to
find out the web of another &s;pider, younger and weaker than it&s;elf, with
whom it ventures a battle. The invader generally &s;ucceds; the young one is
driven out to make a new web, and the old one remains in quiet
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. If, however, the &s;pider is unable to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s
any other of its web, it then endeavours, for a while, to &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon
accidental depredation; but in two or three months it inevitably dies of
hunger.</P>
<P>The garden-&s;pider &s;eems to work in a dif|ferent manner.
The method with this in&s;ect is to &s;pin a great quantity of thread, which
floating in the air in various directions, hap|pens from its glutinous quality,
at la&s;t to &s;tick to &s;ome object near it, a lofty plant or the branch of a
tree. The &s;pider only wants to have one end of the line fa&s;t, in order to
&s;ecure and tighten the other. It accordingly draws the line when thus fixed,
and then by pa&s;&s;ing and repa&s;&s;ing upon it, &s;trengthens the thread in
&s;uch a manner as to an&s;wer, all its intentions. The fir&s;t cord being thus
&s;tretched, the &s;pider walks along a part of it, and there fa&s;tens
ano|ther, and dropping from thence, fa&s;tens the thread to &s;ome &s;olid body
below, then climbs <PB N="258" REF="264"> up again and begins a third, which it
fa&s;tens by the &s;ame contrivance. When three threads are thus fixed, it
forms a &s;quare, or &s;omething that very nearly re&s;embles one; and in this
the animal is generally &s;een to re&s;ide. It often happens, however, when the
young &s;pider begins &s;pinning, that its web becomes too buoyant, and not
only the thread floats in the air, but even the little &s;pin&s;ter. In this
manner we have often &s;een the threads of &s;piders floating in the air; and
what is &s;till more &s;urprizing, the young &s;piders them&s;elves attached to
their own web. The rea&s;on is obvious; for as even gold it&s;elf may be &s;o
finely drawn out as to float in the air, &s;o the finer thread of a &s;pider is
&s;o buoyant as not only to &s;wim in the air, but al&s;o to lift the &s;pider
it&s;elf; which, like the tail of a kite, ri&s;es with its own manufacture.</P>
<P>The &s;pider's web being thus compleated, and fixed in a
proper place, its next care is to &s;eize and &s;ecure whatever in&s;ect
happens to be caught in the toil. For this purpo&s;e, it remains for weeks and
even months upon the watch, with|out ever catching a &s;ingle fly; for the
&s;pider, like mo&s;t other in&s;ects, is &s;urprizingly patient of hunger. It
&s;ometimes happens that too &s;trong a fly &s;trikes it&s;elf again&s;t the
web, and <PB N="259" REF="265"> thus, in&s;tead of being caught, tears the net
to pieces. In general, however, the butterfly or the hornet, when they touch
the web, fly off again, and the &s;pider &s;eems no way di&s;po&s;ed to
interrupt their retreat. The large blue-bottle|fly, the ichneumon-fly, and the
common meat|fly; &s;eem to be its favourite game. When one of the&s;e &s;trike
into the toils, the &s;pider is in|&s;tantly &s;een alert and watchful at the
mouth of its hole, careful to ob&s;erve whether the fly be compleatly
imme&s;hed. If that be the ca&s;e, the &s;pider walks lei&s;urely forward,
&s;eizes its prey, and in&s;tantly kills it by in&s;tilling a venomous juice
into the wound it makes. If, however, the fly be not entirely imme&s;hed, the
&s;pider patiently waits, without appearing until its prey has fatigued
it&s;elf by its &s;truggles to obtain its liberty; for if the ravager &s;hould
appear in all his terrors while the prey is but half involved, a de&s;perate
effort might give it force enough to get free. If the &s;pider has fa&s;ted for
a long time, it then drags the fly immediately into its hole and devours it;
but if there has been plenty of game, and the animal be no way pre&s;&s;ed by
hunger, it then gives the fly two or three turns in its web, &s;o as compleatly
to imme&s;h it, and there leaves it impotently to &s;truggle until the little
tyrant comes to its ap|petite. <PB N="260" REF="266"> Why the &s;pider &s;hould
at one time kill its prey, and at another &s;uffer it to &s;truggle in the
toils for &s;everal hours together, I am not able to &s;ay; perhaps it only
likes its prey newly killed, and therefore delays to put the captive to death
until it is to be eaten.</P>
<P>It has been the opinion of &s;ome philo&s;ophers, that the
&s;pider was in it&s;elf both male and fe|male; but Li&s;ter has been able to
di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;exes, and to perceive that the males were much le&s;s in
&s;ize than the females. But this is not the chief peculiarity; for, different
from all other animals, except the fi&s;h called the Ray, it has its
in&s;truments of generation placed in the fore-arms, which have been already
de&s;cribed. When the&s;e animals copulate, they for &s;ome time teize each
other with their legs and arms, then appear the in&s;truments of ge|neration in
the male, as if bur&s;ting out from the points of its fore-feet, and are
in&s;erted into the receptacle beneath the body of the female.</P>
<P>The female generally lays from nine hundred to a thou&s;and
eggs in a &s;ea&s;on; they are of a blui&s;h colour, &s;peckled with black, and
&s;epa|rated from each other by a glutinous &s;ub&s;tance, not unlike frog
&s;pawn water. The&s;e eggs are large or &s;mall in proportion to the &s;ize of
the animal that produces them. In &s;ome they are <PB N="261" REF="267"> as
large as a grain of mu&s;tard-&s;eed; in others, they are &s;carcely vi&s;ible.
The female never begins to lay till &s;he be two years old at the lea&s;t, and
her fir&s;t brood is never &s;o numerous as when &s;he has come to her
greate&s;t maturity.</P>
<P>When the number of eggs which the &s;pider has brought forth
have remained for an hour or two to dry after exclu&s;ion, the little animal
then prepares to make them a bag, where they are to be hatched until they leave
the &s;hell. For this purpo&s;e, &s;he &s;pins a web four or five times
&s;tronger than that made for catching flies; and be&s;ides, lines it within
&s;ide by a down, which &s;he plucks from her own brea&s;t. This bag, when
compleated, is as thick as paper, is &s;mooth within &s;ide, but rougher
without. Within this they depo&s;it their eggs; and it is almo&s;t incredible
to relate the concern and in|du&s;try which they be&s;tow in the pre&s;ervation
of it. They &s;tick it by means of their glutinous fluid to the end of their
body; &s;o that the ani|mal, when thus loaded, appears as if &s;he had one body
placed behind another. If this bag be &s;eparated from her by any accident,
&s;he employs all her a&s;&s;iduity to &s;tick it again in its former
&s;ituation, and &s;eldom abandons her trea&s;ure but with her life. When the
young ones are excluded from their &s;hells, within the <PB N="262" REF="268">
bag, they remain for &s;ome time in their con|finement, until the female,
in&s;tinctively knowing their maturity, bites open their pri&s;on, and &s;ets
them free. But her parental care does not terminate with their exclu&s;ion;
&s;he receives them upon her back for &s;ome time, until they have &s;trength
to provide for them&s;elves, when they leave her never to return, and each
begins a &s;eparate manufactory of its own. The young ones begin to &s;pin when
they can &s;carcely be di&s;cerned; and prepare for a life of plunder before
they have &s;trength to overcome. Indeed, Nature &s;eems to have formed them in
every re&s;pect for a life of ho&s;tility. No other in&s;ect is
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch various powers of a&s;&s;ault and defence; and they
are able to de&s;troy animals ten times bigger than them&s;elves. Even after a
&s;evere defeat, they quickly recover of their wounds; and as for their legs,
they con|&s;ider the lo&s;s of them as but a &s;mall misfor|tune, as they grow
again very &s;peedily to their former magnitude.</P>
<P>Thus there is no in&s;ect to which they are not an enemy; but
what is more barbarous &s;till, &s;piders are the enemies of each other. Mr.
Reaumur, who was fond of making expe|riments upon in&s;ects, tried to turn the
labours of the &s;pider to human advantage, and actually <PB N="263" REF="269">
made a pair of gloves from their webs. For this purpo&s;e, he collected a large
number of tho&s;e in&s;ects together: he took care to have them con&s;tantly
&s;upplied with flies, and the ends of young feathers, fre&s;h picked from
chickens and pigeons, which being full of blood, are a diet that &s;piders are
particularly fond of. But notwith&s;tanding all his care, he was &s;oon
convinced that it was impracticable to rear them, &s;ince they were of &s;uch a
malignant nature, that they could never be brought to live in &s;ociety; but
in&s;tead of their u&s;ual food, cho&s;e to devour each other. Indeed, were it
practicable to reconcile them to each other, it would require too much
attendance to rear up a &s;ufficient number to make the project any way
u&s;eful. Their thread is four, if not five times finer than that of the
&s;ilk-worm; &s;o that upon the &s;malle&s;t calculation, there mu&s;t have
been &s;ixty thou&s;and &s;piders to make a &s;ingle pound of &s;ilk. That
which Reaumur made u&s;e of, was only the web in which they de|po&s;ited their
eggs, which is five times &s;tronger than their ordinary manufacture.</P>
<P>Of this animal, there are &s;everal kinds, &s;lightly
differing from each other, either in habits or conformation. The Water-&s;pider
is the mo&s;t remarkable of the number. This in&s;ect <PB N="264" REF="270">
re&s;embles the common &s;pider in its appearance, except that its hinder part
is made rather in the &s;hape of a nine-pin than a ball. They differ in being
able to live as well by land as water; and in being capable of &s;pinning as
well in one element as the other. Their appear|ance under water is very
remarkable; for though they inhabit the bottom, yet they are never touched by
the element in which they re&s;ide, but are enclo&s;ed in a bubble of air that,
like a box, &s;urrounds them on every &s;ide. This bubble has the bright
appearance, at the bot|tom, of quick&s;ilver; and within this, they perform
their &s;everal functions of eating, &s;pin|ning and &s;leeping, without its
ever bur&s;ting, or in the lea&s;t di&s;turbing their operations: &s;ome|times,
the bubble is &s;een divided into three di&s;tinct apartments; and in the
&s;pring, the male enters one of tho&s;e to impregnate the female, in the
manner mentioned above, while the bubble in which he was contained unites with
the other, like two drops of water, when approached to each other. They &s;pin
their webs as well in the water as upon land; and it is mo&s;t probable that
they make their food of the &s;mall in&s;ects of either element.</P>
<P>The Tarantula is al&s;o of this &s;pecies, and de|&s;erves
particular notice, not for any remarkable <PB N="265" REF="271"> properties
that really attend it, but for the nu|merous fal&s;ehoods which have been
propagated concerning it. What may be &s;aid with truth concerning it is, that
it is the large&s;t of the &s;pider kind known in Europe, and is a native of
Apulia in Italy. Its body is three quarters of an inch long, and about as thick
as one's little finger; the colour is generally an olive brown, variegated with
one that is more du&s;ky; it has eight legs and eight eyes, like the re&s;t,
and nippers, which are &s;harp and &s;errated: be|tween the&s;e and the fore
legs, there are two little horns, or feelers, which it is ob&s;erved to move
very bri&s;kly when it approaches its prey. It is covered all over the body
with a &s;oft down; and propagates, as other &s;piders, by laying eggs. In the
&s;ummer months, particularly in the dog days, the tarantula creeping among the
corn, bites the mowers and pa&s;&s;engers; but in winter, it lurks in holes,
and is &s;eldom &s;een.</P>
<P>Thus far is true; but now the fable begins: for though the
bite is attended with no dan|gerous &s;ymptoms, and will ea&s;ily cure of
it&s;elf, wonderful &s;tories are reported concerning its virulence. The part
which is bitten, as we are told, is &s;oon after di&s;coloured with a livid
black, or yellowi&s;h circle, attended with an inflam|mation. At fir&s;t the
pain is &s;carcely felt; but <PB N="266" REF="272"> a few hours after, come on
a violent &s;ickne&s;s, difficulty of breathing, fainting, and &s;ometimes
trembling. The per&s;on bit, after this does no|thing but laugh, dance and
&s;kip about, putting him&s;elf into the mo&s;t extravagant po&s;tures; and
&s;ometimes al&s;o is &s;eized with a mo&s;t frightful melancholly. At the
return of the &s;ea&s;on in which he was bit, his madne&s;s begins again; and
the patient always talks of the &s;ame things. Sometimes he fancies him&s;elf a
&s;hepherd; &s;ome|times a king; appearing entirely out of his &s;en&s;es.
The&s;e trouble&s;ome &s;ymptoms &s;ometimes return for &s;everal years
&s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and at la&s;t terminate in death. But &s;o dreadful a
di&s;order has it &s;eems not been left without a remedy; which is no other
than a well played fiddle. For this purpo&s;e the medical mu&s;ician plays a
particular tune, famous for the cure, which he begins &s;low, and encrea&s;es
in quickne&s;s as he &s;ees the patient affected. The patient no &s;ooner hears
the mu&s;ic, but he begins to dance; and continues &s;o doing till he is all
over in a &s;weat, which forces out the venom that appeared &s;o dangerous.
This dancing &s;ometimes continues for three or four hours, before the patient
is weary, and before the &s;weating is copious enough to cure the di&s;order.
Such are the &s;ymptoms related of the tarantula poi&s;on; &s;ymptoms which 
<PB N="267" REF="273"> &s;ome of the be&s;t and grave&s;t phy&s;icians have
credited, and attempted to account for. But the truth is, that the whole is an
impo&s;ition of the pea&s;ants upon travellers who happen to pa&s;s through
that part of the country, and who pro|cure a trifle for &s;uffering
them&s;elves to be bitten by the tarantula. Whenever they find a tra|veller
willing to try the experiment, they readily offer them&s;elves; and are &s;ure
to counterfeit the whole train of &s;ymptoms which mu&s;ic is &s;up|po&s;ed to
remove. A friend of mine, who pa&s;&s;ed through that part of the country, had
a tru&s;ty &s;ervant bitten, without ever admini&s;tring the mu&s;ical cure:
the only &s;ymptoms were a &s;light inflammation, which was readily removed,
and no other con&s;equence ever attended the bite.&mdash;It is thus that
fal&s;ehoods prevail for a century or two; and mankind at la&s;t begin to
wonder how it was po&s;&s;ible to keep up the delu&s;ion &s;o long.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of the Flea.</HEAD>
<P>THE hi&s;tory of tho&s;e animals with which we are the be&s;t
acquainted, are the fir&s;t objects of our chiefe&s;t curio&s;ity. There are
few but are well informed of the agility and the blood-thir&s;ty
di&s;|po&s;ition of the Flea; of the caution with which it comes to the attack;
and the readine&s;s with which it avoids the pur&s;uit. This in&s;ect, which is
not only the enemy of mankind, but of the dog, cat, and &s;everal other
animals, is found in every part of the world, but bites with greater &s;everity
in &s;ome countries than in others. Its numbers in Italy and France are much
greater than in England; and yet its bite is much more trouble&s;ome here, than
I have found it in any other place. It would &s;eem that its force en|crea&s;ed
with the coldne&s;s of the climate; and though le&s;s prolific, that it became
more pre|daceous.</P>
<P>If the flea be examined with a micro&s;cope, it will be
ob&s;erved to have a &s;mall head, large eyes, and a roundi&s;h body. It has
two feelers, or horns, which are &s;hort, and compo&s;ed of four joints; and

through which it &s;ucks the blood in large quantities. The body ap|pears to be
all over curiou&s;ly adorned with a &s;uit of poli&s;hed &s;able armour, neatly
jointed, and be&s;et with multitudes of &s;harp pins, almo&s;t like the quills

<P>The young fleas are at fir&s;t a &s;ort of nits or eggs, which
are round and &s;mooth; and from the&s;e proceed white worms, of a &s;hining
pearl colour: in a fortnight's time they come to a tolerable &s;ize, and are
very lively and active; but if they are touched at this time, they roll
them&s;elves up in a ball: &s;oon after this they begin to creep, like
&s;ilk-worms that have no legs; and then they &s;eek a place to lie hid in,

<HEAD>CHAP. V. Of the Lou&s;e and its Varieties.</HEAD>
<P>THE antipathies of mankind are various; &s;ome con&s;idering
the toad, &s;ome the &s;erpent, &s;ome the &s;pider, and &s;ome the beetle,
with a &s;trong degree of dete&s;tation: but while all wonder at the
&s;trangene&s;s of each other's aver|&s;ions, they all &s;eem to unite in their
di&s;like to the Lou&s;e, and regard it as their natural and mo&s;t nau&s;eous
enemy. Indeed, it &s;eems the enemy of man in the mo&s;t odious degree; for
wherever wretchedne&s;s, di&s;ea&s;e, or hunger &s;eize upon him, the lou&s;e
&s;eldom fails to add it&s;elf to the tribe, and to encrea&s;e in proportion to
the number of his calamities.</P>
<P>In examining the human lou&s;e with the mi|cro&s;cope, its
external deformity fir&s;t &s;trikes us with di&s;gu&s;t: the &s;hape of the
fore part of the head is &s;omewhat oblong; that of the hind part &s;omewhat
round: the &s;kin is hard, and being &s;tretched, tran&s;parent, with here and
there &s;e|veral bri&s;tly hairs: in the fore part is a probo&s;cis or
&s;ucker, which is &s;eldom vi&s;ible: on each &s;ide of the head are antennae,
or horns, each divided into five joints, covered with bri&s;tly hair; and 
<PB N="271" REF="278"> &s;everal white ve&s;&s;els are &s;een through the&s;e
horns: behind the&s;e are the eyes, which &s;eem to want tho&s;e divi&s;ions
ob&s;ervable in other in&s;ects, and appear encompa&s;&s;ed with &s;ome few
hairs: the neck is very &s;hort, and the brea&s;t is divided into three parts;
on each &s;ide of which are placed &s;ix legs, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ix joints,
covered al&s;o with bri&s;tly hairs: the ends of the legs are armed with two
&s;maller and larger ruddy claws, &s;erving tho&s;e in&s;ects as a finger and
thumb, by which they catch hold of &s;uch objects as they approach: the end of
the body terminates in a cloven tail, while the &s;ides are all over hairy; the
whole re&s;embling clear parchment, and, when roughly pre&s;&s;ed, cracking
with a noi&s;e.</P>
<P>When we take a clo&s;er view, its white veins, and other
internal parts appear; as likewi&s;e a mo&s;t wonderful motion in its
inte&s;tines, from the tran&s;parency of its external covering. When the
lou&s;e feeds, the blood is &s;een to ru&s;h, like a torrent, into the
&s;tomach; and its greedine&s;s is &s;o great, that the excrements contained in
the inte&s;tines are ejected at the &s;ame time, to make room for this new
&s;upply.</P>
<P>The lou&s;e has neither beak, teeth, nor any kind of mouth, as
Doctor Hooke de&s;cribed it; for the entrance into the gullet is ab&s;olutely
clo&s;ed. In the place of all the&s;e, it has a pro|bo&s;cis 
<PB N="272" REF="279"> or trunk; or, as it may be otherwi&s;e called, a pointed
hollow &s;ucker, with which it pierces the &s;kin, and &s;ucks the human blood,
taking that for food only. The &s;tomach is lodged partly in the brea&s;t and
back; but the greate&s;t portion of it is in the abdomen. When &s;wolen with
blood, it appears of a dark brown colour, which is vi&s;ible through the
&s;kin; and is either a faint red, or a full or bright brown, as the contents
of the &s;tomach are more or le&s;s changed. When it is empty, it is
colourle&s;s; but when filled, it is plainly di&s;cernible, and its motion
&s;eems very extraordinary. It then appears working with very &s;trong
agitations, and &s;omewhat re&s;embles an animal within an animal. Superficial
ob&s;ervers are apt to take this for the pul&s;ation of the heart; but if the
animal be ob&s;erved when it is &s;ucking, it will then be found that the food
takes a direct pa&s;|&s;age from the trunk to the &s;tomach, where the
remainder of the old aliment will be &s;een mixing with the new, and agitated
up and down on every &s;ide.</P>
<P>If this animal be kept from food two or three days, and then
placed upon the back of the hand, or any &s;oft part of the body, it will
im|mediately &s;eek for food; which it will the more readily find, if the hand
be rubbed till it grows <PB N="273" REF="280"> red. The animal then turns its
head, which lies between the two fore legs, to the &s;kin, and diligently
&s;earches for &s;ome pore: when found, it fixes the trunk therein; and &s;oon
the mi|cro&s;cope di&s;covers the blood a&s;cending through the head, in a very
rapid, and even frightful &s;tream. The lou&s;e has at that time &s;ufficient
appetite to feed in any po&s;ture; it is then &s;een &s;ucking with its head
downward, and its tail elevated. If, during this operation, the &s;kin be drawn
tight, the trunk is bound fa&s;t, and the animal is incapable of di&s;engaging
it&s;elf; but it more frequently &s;uffers from its gluttony, &s;ince it gorges
to &s;uch a degree, that it is cru&s;hed to pieces by the &s;lighte&s;t
impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Whether lice are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the parts of generation
into males and females, is not yet di&s;covered: Swammerdam is enclined to
think that they are hermaphrodites, having found an ovary in all tho&s;e he
examined; and he di&s;&s;ected not le&s;s than forty-two. In one of the&s;e
animals were found ten large eggs; and forty-four &s;maller, that were not yet
come to their full perfection.</P>
<P>There is &s;carce any animal that multiplies &s;o fa&s;t as
this unwelcome intruder. It has been plea&s;antly &s;aid, that a lou&s;e
becomes a grand|father in the &s;pace of twenty-four hours: this 
<PB N="274" REF="281"> fact cannot be a&s;certained; but nothing is more true
than, that the moment the nit, which is no other than the egg of the lou&s;e,
gets rid of its &s;uperfluous moi&s;ture, and throws off its &s;hell, it then
begins to breed in its turn. Nothing &s;o much prevents the encrea&s;e of this
nau&s;eous animal, as cold and want of humidity; the nits mu&s;t be laid in a
place that is warm, and mo|derately moi&s;t, to produce any thing. This is the
rea&s;on that many nits laid on the hairs in the night-time, are de&s;troyed by
the cold of the &s;uceeding day; and &s;o &s;tick for &s;everal months, till
they at la&s;t come to lo&s;e even their external form.</P>
<P>The lou&s;e is found upon every part of the human body; but
particularly in the heads of children. Tho&s;e found upon the miners in Sweden,
are &s;aid, by Linnaeus, to be very large; and he is of opinion, that the head
and the body-lou&s;e differ in no re&s;pect from each other. The Pthiria&s;is,
or lou&s;y di&s;ea&s;e, though very little known at pre&s;ent, was frequent
enough among the ancients: Herod, Antiochus, Epi|phanes, Alcman the poet,
Pherecydes, Ca&s;|&s;ander, Calli&s;thenes and Sylla, all died of this
di&s;order. The u&s;e of mercury, which was un|known among the ancients, may
probably have bani&s;hed it from among the moderns; for cer|tain 
<PB N="275" REF="282"> it is, that tho&s;e animals &s;eldom attack any in our
climate, but &s;uch as from &s;loth or famine invite their company.</P>
<P>Such is the hi&s;tory of the human lou&s;e; which, from its
connection with mankind, de&s;erves fir&s;t notice: but it would be endle&s;s
to de|&s;cribe the various tribes that go under this name, and &s;warm upon
every part of nature. There is &s;carce an animal, and &s;carce even a
vegetable, that does not &s;uffer under its own peculiar lou&s;e. The &s;heep,
the hor&s;e, the hog, and the elephant, are all teized by them; the whale, the
&s;hark, the &s;almon, and the lob&s;ter, are not without their company; while
every hot-hou&s;e, and every gar|den is infe&s;ted with &s;ome peculiarly
de&s;tructive. Linnaeus tells us, that he once found a vege|table-lou&s;e upon
&s;ome plants newly arrived from America; and willing to trace the little
animal through its various &s;tages, he brought it with him from London to
Leyden; where he care|fully pre&s;erved it during the winter, until it bred in
the &s;pring: but the lou&s;e it &s;eems did not treat him with all the
gratitude he expected; for it became the parent of &s;o numerous a pro|geny,
that it &s;oon overrun all the phy&s;ic-garden of that beautiful city; and
leaves, to this day, many a gardener to cur&s;e the Swede's too in|dulgent
curio&s;ity.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="283">The animal which &s;ome have called the
Leaf Lou&s;e, is of the &s;ize of a flea, and of a bright green, or blui&s;h
green colour; the body is nearly oval, and is large&s;t and mo&s;t convex on
the hinder part; the brea&s;t is very &s;mall, and the head is blunt and green:
the eyes may be &s;een very plainly, being prominent on the fore part of the
head, and of a &s;hining black colour; near the&s;e there is a black line on
each &s;ide; and the legs are very &s;lender.</P>
<P>The&s;e animals are u&s;ually found upon the leaves of the
orache, and other plants; and the weaker the leaves and buds are, the&s;e
in&s;ects &s;warm upon them in greater abundance. Some plants are covered over
with them; though they are not the cau&s;e of the plants weakne&s;s, but the
&s;ign: however, by wounding and &s;ucking the leaf, they encrea&s;e the
di&s;ea&s;e. They ge|nerally a&s;&s;ume their colour from the plant on which
they re&s;ide. Tho&s;e that feed upon pot|herbs and plum trees, are of an
a&s;h-colour; only they are greeni&s;h when they are young: tho&s;e that belong
to the alder and cherry-tree, are black; as al&s;o tho&s;e upon beans, and
&s;ome other plants: tho&s;e on the leaves of apples and ro&s;e-trees, are
white: but as they leap, like gra&s;s&s;hoppers, &s;ome place them in the
number of the flea kind. The mo&s;t uncommon colour <PB N="277" REF="284"> is
reddi&s;h; and lice of this &s;ort may be found on the leaves of tan&s;ey; and
their juice, when rubbed in the hands, tinges them with no di&s;|agreeable red.
All the&s;e live upon their re|&s;pective plant; and are often engendered
within the very &s;ub&s;tance of the leaf.</P>
<P>All the&s;e bring forth their young alive; and the faetus,
when it is ready to be brought forth, entirely fills the belly of the female;
its fore parts being excluded fir&s;t, and then the hinder. The young one does
not begin to move till the horns or feelers appear out of the body of the old
one; and by the motion of the&s;e it fir&s;t &s;hews &s;igns of life, moving
them in every di|rection, and bending all their joints. When the horns and head
are excluded, the two fore feet follow, which they move with equal agility;
after this follow the middle feet, and then the hinder: &s;till, however, the
young one continues &s;ticking to its parent, &s;upported only at one
extremity, and hanging as it were in air, until its &s;mall and &s;oft members
become hardened and fitted for &s;elf-&s;upport. The parent then gets rid of
its burthen; by moving from the place where &s;he was &s;itting, and forcing
the young one to &s;tand upon its legs, leaves it to &s;hift for it&s;elf.</P>
<P>As the animal has not far to go, its provi&s;ion 
<PB N="278" REF="285"> lying beneath it, during the &s;ummer it continues to
eat and creep about with great agility. But as it is viviparous, and mu&s;t
nece&s;&s;arily lurk &s;omewhere in winter, where its body may be defended from
the cold, it endeavours to &s;ecure a retreat near the trees or plants that
&s;erve to nouri&s;h it in the beginning of &s;pring. They never hide
them&s;elves in the earth, like many other in&s;ects, becau&s;e they have no
part of their bodies fitted to remove the earth; nor can they creep into every
chink, as their legs are too long: be&s;ides, their bodies are &s;o tender,
that the lea&s;t rough particle of the earth would hurt them. They therefore
get into the deep chinks of the bark, and into the cavities of the &s;tronger
&s;talks, from whence they &s;ally out upon the branches and leaves, when the
warmth of the &s;un begins to be felt. Neither the cold in the autumnal
&s;ea&s;on, nor the le&s;&s;er degree of heat in the &s;pring, ever hurts them;
they &s;eldom, therefore, &s;eek for hiding-places before the fall of the leaf,
and are alert enough to take the earlie&s;t advantage of the returning
&s;pring.</P>
<P>Like many other in&s;ects, they ca&s;t their &s;kins four
&s;everal times; and, what is very remarkable, the males have four wings, but
the females never have any. They all have long legs, not only to enable them to
creep over the long hairs of <PB N="279" REF="286"> plants and leaves, but
al&s;o to travel from one tree to another, when they happen to &s;tand at a
di&s;tance. Their trunk or &s;nout lies under their brea&s;t; and this they
thru&s;t into the pores of the plant to &s;uck out the juice, for they do not
gnaw them, like the caterpillar; but &s;o hurt them by &s;ucking, that the
leaves become &s;potted, and as it were overrun with &s;cabs; for which
rea&s;on their edges always turn up towards the middle.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that the&s;e in&s;ects are often carried
away and devoured by ants; but this Fry&s;ch, from whom this de&s;cription is
taken, could never ob&s;erve. The ants indeed are fond of tho&s;e trees where
there is a great number of tho&s;e in&s;ects; but then it is only to &s;uck the
juice which flows from the leaves that have been ju&s;t wounded. This more
particularly happens in the heat of &s;ummer, when other moi&s;ture is wanting:
however, he never found them hurting or carrying away any of the&s;e in&s;ects
while alive; nor indeed were they able, for the leaf lou&s;e is more than a
match for the ant at &s;ingle combat. Whenever they perceive the ant
approaching behind them, they kick back with their hinder feet, and thus drive
off the invader, as a hor&s;e would a lion.</P>
<P>The three principal and con&s;tant enemies to 
<PB N="280" REF="287"> the&s;e in&s;ects are fir&s;t, the fire-flie, which lays
its eggs where the&s;e in&s;ects are in greate&s;t number, which producing a
worm, &s;eizes and devours all the leaf lice that come near it: another enemy
is the worm of a peculiar kind of beetle, which de&s;troys them in great
numbers: but the mo&s;t formidable of all enemies, is the ichnenmon fly, that
&s;eizes upon one of the large&s;t females, and laying its egg upon her, this
is hatched into a worm, which &s;oon devours and de&s;troys the ani|mal from
who&s;e body it &s;prung.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Of the Bug and its Varieties.</HEAD>
<P>THE Bug is another of tho&s;e nau&s;eous in&s;ects that
intrude upon the retreats of mankind; and that often bani&s;h that &s;leep,
which even &s;orrow and anxiety permitted to approach. This, to many men, is,
of all other in&s;ects, the mo&s;t trouble&s;ome and obnoxious. The night is
u&s;ually the &s;ea&s;on when the wretched have re&s;t from their labour; but
this &s;eems the only &s;ea&s;on when the bug i&s;&s;ues from its retreats, to
make its depredations. By day it lurks, like a robber, in the mo&s;t &s;ecret
parts of the bed; takes the advantage of every chink and cranny, to make a
&s;ecure lodgment; and contrives its habitation with &s;o much art, that
&s;carce any indu&s;try can di&s;cover its retreat. It &s;eems to avoid the
light with great cunning; and even if candles be kept burning, this formidable
in|&s;ect will not i&s;&s;ue from its hiding-place. But when darkne&s;s
promi&s;es &s;ecurity, it then i&s;&s;ues from every corner of the bed, drops
from the te&s;ter, crawls from behind the arras, and travels with great
a&s;&s;iduity to the unhappy patient, who vainly wi&s;hes for re&s;t and
refre&s;hment. It is <PB N="282" REF="289"> generally vain to de&s;troy one
only, as there are hundreds more to revenge their companion's fate; &s;o that
the per&s;on who thus is &s;ubject to be bitten, remains the whole night like a
cen|tinel upon duty, rather watching the approach of fre&s;h invaders, than
inviting the plea&s;ing approaches of &s;leep.</P>
<P>Nor are the&s;e in&s;ects le&s;s di&s;agreeable from their
nau&s;eous &s;tench, than their uncea&s;ing ap|petites. When they begin to
crawl, the whole bed is infected with the &s;mell; but if they are accidentally
killed, then it is in&s;upportable.</P>
<P>The&s;e are a part of the inconveniences that re&s;ult from
the per&s;ecution of the&s;e odious in|&s;ects: but happily for Great Britain,
they mul|tiply le&s;s in the&s;e i&s;lands, than in any part of the continent.
In France and Italy the beds, par|ticularly in their inns, &s;warm with them;
and every piece of furniture &s;eems to afford them a retreat. They grow larger
al&s;o with them than with us, and bite with more cruel appetite.</P>
<P>This animal, if examined minutely, appears to con&s;i&s;t of
three principal parts; the head, the cor&s;elet, and the belly. It has two
brown eyes, that are very &s;mall, and a little prominent, be&s;ides two
feelers, with three joints: underneath the&s;e there is a crooked trunk, which
is its in|&s;trument of torture, and which, when in motion, 
<PB N="283" REF="290"> lies clo&s;e upon the brea&s;t. The brea&s;t is a kind
of ring, in which are placed the two fir&s;t pair of legs. The belly
con&s;i&s;ts of nine rings; under which are placed two pair of legs more,
making &s;ix in all. Each leg has three joints, which form the thigh, the leg,
and the foot, which is armed with a crooked claw, like an hook. The body is
&s;mooth, except a few &s;hort hairs, that may be &s;een by the micro&s;cope,
about the vent, and on the two la&s;t rings. Its motion is &s;low and unwieldy;
yet its &s;ight is &s;o exqui&s;ite, that the in&s;tant it perceives the light,
it generally makes good its retreat; and they are &s;eldom caught, though the
bed &s;warms with them.</P>
<P>If we examine this in&s;ect internally, we &s;hall find the
great artery, which in all in&s;ects per|forms the functions of the heart; we
&s;hall find the apertures of the lungs on the right &s;ide and the left,
through which the animal breathes; we &s;hall find a &s;tomach and
inte&s;tines, which, as in other animals, run from the mouth to the anus. If
the in&s;ect has been kept long fa&s;ting, there will be a mucous found in its
body, like the white of an egg; but if cru&s;hed after a full meal, the human
blood, which it has &s;ucked in, will appear a little darkened by having
pa&s;&s;ed through the in&s;ect's body.</P>
<P>The male and female of the&s;e animals are 
<PB N="284" REF="291"> plainly di&s;tingui&s;hable from each other; and the
parts of generation are obvious enough. They are often found coupling tail to
tail; and in this &s;tate are very ea&s;ily de&s;troyed. The female has an
ovary filled with eggs, joined together like a bunch of grapes; each egg being
oblong, almo&s;t cylindrical, inclining to white, and pretty tran&s;parent. In
about two days after impregnation by the male, &s;he depo&s;its her eggs to the
number of about an hundred and fifty, in &s;ome convenient place where they are
likely to receive no di&s;turbance. There they continue for &s;ome months;
during which time, neither cold nor heat, neither moi&s;ture nor fu|migation,
can in the lea&s;t retard their exclu&s;ion; but they come forth active, and
ready for mi&s;|chief. It is this hardine&s;s in the &s;hell that &s;eems to
continue the breed; as the old ones die every winter, or are ea&s;ily
de&s;troyed by any fumigation that is u&s;ed for that purpo&s;e. But the eggs
&s;eem incapable of de&s;truction; even tho&s;e men who make a livelihood by
killing the&s;e nau&s;eous in&s;ects, though they can an&s;wer for the parent,
can never be &s;ure of the egg. For this rea&s;on they u&s;ually pay tho&s;e
hou&s;es to which they are called a &s;econd or a third vi&s;it, and at la&s;t
ex|terminate them by per&s;everance.</P>
<P>The manner of de&s;troying them &s;eems rather 
<PB N="285" REF="292"> the effects of a&s;&s;iduity than antidote; for the men
called in upon this occa&s;ion, take every part of the furniture a&s;under,
bru&s;h every part of it with great a&s;&s;iduity, anoint it with a liquid,
which I take to be a &s;olution of corro&s;ive &s;ub|limate, and having
performed this operation twice or thrice, the vermin are mo&s;t u&s;ually
de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>Cleanline&s;s, therefore, &s;eems to be the be&s;t antidote to
remove the&s;e nau&s;eous in&s;ects; and wherever that is wanting, their
encrea&s;e &s;eems but a ju&s;t puni&s;hment. Indeed, they are &s;ome|times
found in &s;uch numbers among old fur|niture, and neglected chambers, expo&s;ed
to the &s;outh, that, wanting other &s;u&s;tenance, they de|vour each other.
They are al&s;o enemies to other vermin, and de&s;troy fleas very effectually;
&s;o that we &s;eldom have the double per&s;ecution of different vermin in the
&s;ame bed. Of the bug kind Linnaeus reckons up forty.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Of the Wood-Lou&s;e and its Varieties.</HEAD>
<P>THE common Wood Lou&s;e is &s;eldom above half an inch long,
and a quarter of an inch broad. The colour is of a livid black, e&s;pe|cially
when found about dung-hills, and on the ground; but tho&s;e that are to be met
with un|der tiles, and in drier places, are of the colour of the hair of an
a&s;s. It has fourteen feet, &s;even on each &s;ide; and they have only one
joint each, which is &s;carcely perceivable. It has two &s;hort feelers, and
the body is of an oval &s;hape. When it is touched, it rolls it&s;elf up into a
&s;ort of a ball; and the &s;ides, near the feet, are dentated, like a &s;aw.
It is often found among rotten timber, and on decayed trees: in winter it lies
hid in the crevices of walls and all &s;orts of buildings. The male is ea&s;ily
di&s;tingui&s;hable from the female, being le&s;s, and more &s;lender. The eggs
they lay are white and &s;hining, like &s;eed pearls, and are very numerous:
however, more properly &s;peak|ing, although, when excluded, the young have all
the appearance of an egg, yet they are alive, and, without throwing off any
&s;hell, &s;tir and <PB N="287" REF="294"> move about with great vivacity; &s;o
that this animal may properly be &s;aid to be viviparous. The little worms at

bri&s;k. The&s;e animals are of great u&s;e in medicine: being impregnated with
a &s;aline quality, which is diuretic and &s;timulating. Of this in&s;ect
Linnaeus makes three &s;pecies.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. Of the Monoculus, or Arbore&s;cent
Water-Flea.</HEAD>
<P>THIS animal, which is of the &s;ize of a flea, ap|pears to the
&s;ight, una&s;&s;i&s;ted by the micro&s;cope, to have but one eye; for the
eyes, by rea&s;on of the &s;mallne&s;s of the head, &s;eem to be joined to each
other: they are &s;ituated in the trunk of this in&s;ect, and the beak is
likewi&s;e very &s;mall and &s;harp pointed. The &s;tructure of the eye is
&s;een, by the micro&s;cope, to be reticulated, or made like a net; and the
trunk of this in&s;ect, by which it feeds, is not only &s;mall and &s;harp, but
al&s;o tran&s;parent. The in&s;ects are of a blood red colour; and &s;ometimes
are &s;een in &s;uch multitudes on the &s;urface of &s;tanding water, as to
make them appear all over red, whence many fanciful people have thought the
water to be turned into blood.</P>
<P>Swammerdam tells us of a celebrated pro|fe&s;&s;or of Leyden,
who was at fir&s;t a&s;toni&s;hed by an appearance of this kind. Being once
intent upon his &s;tudies, he heard a noi&s;e, of which, as it encrea&s;ed by
degrees, he was de&s;irous to know the cau&s;e. The maid-&s;ervant attending to
his &s;ummons, appeared quite petrified with <PB N="289" REF="298"> fear, and
told him, with a tremulous voice, that all the waters of Leyden were turned
into blood. Upon this he went directly in a &s;mall bark to the place where the
water was thus changed, and put &s;ome of the bloody water into a gla&s;s; but
upon viewing it with attention, he ob&s;erved, that it abounded with infinite
num|bers of the&s;e little red in&s;ects, which tinged the whole body of the
fluid with that &s;eemingly formidable colour. Thus his &s;udden fright was
changed into la&s;ting admiration.</P>
<P>Of all parts of this animal, its branching arms, and the
motion it makes with them in the water, de&s;erve our greate&s;t attention. By
the&s;e the little creature can move in a &s;traight line; waving its arms, as
a bird does its wings in the air, &s;ometimes upward, &s;ometimes down|ward,
&s;ometimes to the right, &s;ometimes to the left, yet &s;till continuing to
proceed in a right line. By &s;triking the water with its arms, it can a&s;cend
with great velocity; and by &s;triking in a contrary direction, it dives with
equal ea&s;e. As the&s;e motions are very rapid, the little ani|mal appears to
jump in the water, its head always tending to the &s;urface, and its tail
&s;tretched downward. This in&s;ect is produced from an egg, which, when
excluded, is carried on the back of the female, and &s;oon is &s;een 
<PB N="290" REF="299"> floating in the water round her. Its ap|pearance at
fir&s;t is that of a very &s;mall whiti&s;h in&s;ect, endued with a very nimble
motion. Except in colour, it &s;uffers no change, only continuing to grow
larger and redder, as it grows old. They &s;ometimes remain &s;everal days on
the &s;urface of the water; and &s;ometimes are &s;een at the bottom only; but
they are never at re&s;t. They change their &s;kin, like mo&s;t other
in&s;ects; and the ca&s;t &s;kin re&s;embles the in&s;ect it&s;elf &s;o

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. Of the Scorpion and its Varieties.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is &s;carce an in&s;ect without wings that is not
obnoxious to man: the &s;malle&s;t have the power of annoying him, either by
biting or &s;tinging him; and though each is in it&s;elf con|temptible, they
become formidable from their numbers. But of all this cla&s;s, there is none
&s;o terrible as the Scorpion, who&s;e &s;hape is hideous, who&s;e &s;ize among
the in&s;ect tribe is enormous, and who&s;e &s;ting is generally fatal. Happy
for England, the &s;corpion is entirely a &s;tranger among us! In &s;everal
parts of the continent of Europe it is but too well known, though it &s;el|dom
grows above four inches long: but in the warm tropical climates, it is &s;een a
foot in length, and in every re&s;pect as large as a lob&s;ter.</P>
<P>The &s;corpion is one of the large&s;t of the in&s;ect tribe,
and not le&s;s terrible from its &s;ize than its malignity. It re&s;embles a
lob&s;ter &s;ome|what in &s;hape, but is infinitely more hideous. There have
been enumerated nine different kinds of this dangerous in&s;ect, chiefly
di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by their colour: there being &s;corpions 
<PB N="292" REF="301"> yellow, brown, and a&s;h coloured; others that are the
colour of ru&s;ty iron, green, pale yellow, black, claret colour, white, and
grey.</P>
<P>There are four principal parts di&s;tingui&s;hable in this
animal; the head, the brea&s;t, the belly, and the tail. The &s;corpion's head
&s;eems, as it were, jointed to the brea&s;t, in the middle of which are &s;een
two eyes; and a little more for|ward, two eyes more, placed in the fore part of
the head: the&s;e eyes are &s;o &s;mall, that they are &s;carcely perceivable;
and it is probable the animal has but little occa&s;ion for &s;eeing. The mouth
is furni&s;hed with two jaws; the under|mo&s;t is divided into two, and the
parts notched into each other, which &s;erves the animal as teeth, and with
which it breaks its food, and thru&s;ts it into its mouth: the&s;e the
&s;corpion can at plea&s;ure pull back into its mouth, &s;o that no part of
them can be &s;een. On each &s;ide of the head are two arms, each compo&s;ed of
four joints; the la&s;t of which is large, with &s;trong mu&s;cles, and made in
the manner of a lob&s;ter's claw. Below the brea&s;t are eight articulated
legs, each divided into &s;ix joints; the two hind|mo&s;t of which are each
provided with two crooked claws, and here and there covered with hair. The
belly is divided into &s;even little rings; from the lowe&s;t of which is
continued a <PB N="293" REF="302"> tail, compo&s;ed of &s;ix joints, which are
bri&s;tly, and formed like little globes, the la&s;t being armed with a crooked
&s;ting. This is that fatal in&s;trument which renders this in&s;ect &s;o
formi|dable: it is long, pointed, hard and hollow; it is pierced near the
ba&s;e by two &s;mall holes, through which, when the animal &s;tings, it ejects
a drop of poi&s;on, which is white, cau&s;tic, and fatal. The re&s;ervoir in
which this poi&s;on is kept, is in a &s;mall bladder near the tail, into which
the venom is di&s;tilled by a peculiar apparatus. If this bladder be gently
pre&s;&s;ed, the venom will be &s;een i&s;&s;uing out through the two holes
above|mentioned; &s;o that it appears, that when the animal &s;tings, the
bladder is pre&s;&s;ed, and the venom i&s;&s;ues through the two apertures into
the wound.</P>
<P>There are few animals more formidable, or more truly
mi&s;chievous than the &s;corpion. As it takes refuge in a &s;mall place, and
is generally found &s;heltering in hou&s;es, &s;o it cannot be other|wi&s;e
than that it mu&s;t frequently &s;ting tho&s;e among whom it re&s;ides. In
&s;ome of the towns of Italy, and in France, in the province of Lan|guedoc, it
is one of the greate&s;t pe&s;ts that tor|ment mankind: but its malignity in
Europe is trifling, when compared to what the natives of Africa, and the
ea&s;t, are known to experience. <PB N="294" REF="303"> In Batavia, where they
grow twelve inches long, there is no removing any piece of furniture, without
the utmo&s;t danger of being &s;tung by them. Bo&s;man a&s;&s;ures us, that,
along the Gold Coa&s;t, they are often found larger than a lob|&s;ter; and that
their &s;ting is inevitably fatal. In Europe, however, they are by no means
&s;o large, &s;o venomous, or &s;o plenty. The general &s;ize of this animal
does not exceed two or three inches; and its &s;ting is very &s;eldom found to
be fatal. Maupertius, who made &s;everal experiments on the &s;corpion of
Languedoc, found it by no means &s;o invariably dangerous as had till then been
repre&s;ented. He provoked one of them to &s;ting a dog, in three places of the
belly, where the animal was without hair. In about an hour after the poor
animal &s;eemed greatly &s;wolen, and became very &s;ick: he then ca&s;t up
whatever he had in his bowels; and, for about three hours, continued vomiting a
whiti&s;h liquid. The belly was always greatly &s;wolen, when the animal be|gan
to vomit; but this operation always &s;eemed to abate the &s;welling; which
alternately &s;welled, and was thus emptied, for three hours
&s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively. The poor animal, after this, fell into convul&s;ions, bit
the ground, dragged him&s;elf along upon his fore feet, and at la&s;t died,
five hours after being bitten. He was not partially <PB N="295" REF="304">
&s;wolen round the place which was bitten, as is u&s;ual after the &s;ting of a
wa&s;p or a bee; but his whole body was inflated, and there only ap|peared a
red &s;pot on the places where he had been &s;tung.</P>
<P>Some days after, however, the &s;ame expe|riment was tried
upon another dog, and even with more aggravated cruelty; yet the dog &s;eemed
no way affected by the wounds, but howling a little when he received them,
con|tinued alert and well after them; and &s;oon after was &s;et at liberty,
without &s;hewing the &s;malle&s;t &s;ymptoms of pain. So far was this poor
creature from being terrified at the experiment, that he left his own
ma&s;ter's hou&s;e, to come to that of the philo&s;opher, where he had received
more plentiful entertainment. The &s;ame experiment was tried by fre&s;h
&s;corpions, upon &s;even other dogs, and upon three hens; but not the
&s;malle&s;t deadly &s;ymptom was &s;een to en&s;ue. From hence it appears,
that many circum&s;tances, which are utterly unknown, mu&s;t contribute to give
efficacy to the &s;corpion's venom. Whether its food, long fa&s;ting, the
&s;ea&s;on, the nature of the ve&s;&s;els it wounds, or its &s;tate of
maturity, contribute to, or retard its malignity, is yet to be a&s;certained by
&s;ucceeding experiment. In the trials made by our philo&s;opher, he em|ployed 
<PB N="296" REF="305"> &s;corpions of both &s;exes, newly caught, and
&s;eemingly vigorous and active. The &s;uc|ce&s;s of this experiment may
&s;erve to &s;hew that, many of tho&s;e boa&s;ted antidotes which are given for
the cure of the &s;corpion's &s;ting, owe their &s;ucce&s;s rather to accident
than their own efficacy. They only happened to cure, when their &s;ting was no
way dangerous; but in ca&s;es of actual malignity, they might probably be
utterly un|&s;erviceable.</P>
<P>The &s;corpion of the tropical climates being much larger than
the former, is probably much more venomous. Helbigius, however, who re|&s;ided
for many years in the ea&s;t, a&s;&s;ures us, that he was often &s;tung by the
&s;corpion, and never received any material injury from the wound: a painful
tumour generally en&s;ued; but he al|ways cured it, by rubbing the part with a
piece of iron or &s;tone, as he had &s;een the Indians practi&s;e before him,
until the fle&s;h became in|&s;en&s;ible. Seba, Moore and Bo&s;man, however,
give a very different account of the &s;corpion's malignity; and a&s;&s;ert
that, unle&s;s &s;peedily re|lieved, the wound becomes fatal.</P>
<P>It is certain that, no animal in the creation &s;eems endued
with &s;uch an ira&s;cible nature. I have often &s;een them taken and put into
a place of &s;ecurity, exerting all their rage again&s;t the 
<PB N="297" REF="306"> &s;ides of the gla&s;s ve&s;&s;el that contained them. I
have &s;een them attempt to &s;ting a &s;tick, when put near them; and attack a
mou&s;e or a frog, while tho&s;e animals were far from offering any injury.
Maupertius put three &s;corpions and a mou&s;e into the &s;ame ve&s;&s;el
together, and they &s;oon &s;tung the little animal in different places. The
mou&s;e, thus a&s;&s;aulted, &s;tood for &s;ome time upon the defen&s;ive, and
at la&s;t killed them all, one after another. He tried this experiment, in
order to &s;ee whether the mou&s;e, after it had killed, would eat the
&s;corpions; but the little qua|drupede &s;eemed entirely &s;atisfied with the
victory, and even &s;urvived the &s;everity of the wounds it had received.
Wolkamer tried the courage of the &s;corpion again&s;t the large &s;pider, and
en|clo&s;ed &s;everal of both kinds in gla&s;s ve&s;&s;els, for that
purpo&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ephemerides. Dec. II. 1687. Ob&s;erv.
224.</BIBL></NOTE>. The &s;ucce&s;s of this combat was very remarkable. The
&s;pider at fir&s;t u&s;ed all its efforts to imme&s;h the &s;corpion in its
web, which it immediately began &s;pinning; but the &s;corpion re&s;cued
it&s;elf from the danger, by &s;tinging its adver&s;ary to death: it &s;oon
after cut off, with its claws, all the legs of the &s;pider, and then &s;ucked
all the internal parts at its lei&s;ure.&mdash;If the &s;corpion's &s;kin had
not been &s;o hard, Wol|kamer is of opinion that the &s;pider would have 
<PB N="298" REF="307"> obtained the victory; for he had often &s;een one of
the&s;e &s;piders de&s;troy a toad.</P>
<P>The fierce &s;pirit of this animal is equally dangerous to its
own &s;pecies; for &s;corpions are the cruelle&s;t enemies to each other.
Maupertius put about an hundred of them together in the &s;ame gla&s;s; and
they &s;carce came into contact, when they began to exert all their rage in
mutual de&s;truction: there was nothing to be &s;een but one univer&s;al
carnage, without any di&s;tinction of age or &s;ex; &s;o that, in a few days,
there remained only fourteen, which had killed and devoured all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>But their unnatural malignity is &s;till more apparent, in
their cruelty to their offspring. He enclo&s;ed a female &s;corpion, big with
young, in a gla&s;s ve&s;&s;el, and &s;he was &s;een to devour them as fa&s;t
as they were excluded: there was but one only of the number that e&s;caped the
general de&s;truction, by taking refuge on the back of its parent; and this
&s;oon after revenged the cau&s;e of its brethren, by killing the old one in
its turn.</P>
<P>Such is the terrible and unrelenting nature of this in&s;ect,
which neither the bonds of &s;ociety, nor of nature can reclaim: it is even
a&s;&s;erted that, when driven to an extremity, the &s;corpion will often
de&s;troy it&s;elf. The following expe|riment <PB N="299" REF="308"> was
ineffectually tried by Maupertius: but I am &s;o well a&s;&s;ured of it by many
eye|witne&s;&s;es, who have &s;een it both in Italy and America, that I have no
doubt remaining of its veracity. A &s;corpion, newly caught, is placed in the
mid&s;t of a circle of burning charcoal, and thus an egre&s;s prevented on
every &s;ide: the &s;corpion, as I am a&s;&s;ured, runs for about a minute
round the circle, in hopes of e&s;caping; but finding that impo&s;&s;ible, it
&s;tings it&s;elf on the back of the head, and in this manner the un|daunted
&s;uicide in&s;tantly expires.</P>
<P>It is happy for mankind that the&s;e animals are thus
de&s;tructive to each other; &s;ince other|wi&s;e they would multiply in &s;o
great a degree as to render &s;ome countries uninhabitable. The male and female
of this in&s;ect are very ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hable; the male being
&s;maller and le&s;s hairy. The female brings forth her young alive, and
perfect in their kind. Redi having bought a quantity of &s;corpions,
&s;e|lected the females, which by their &s;ize and roughne&s;s were ea&s;ily
di&s;tingui&s;hable from the re&s;t, and putting them in &s;eparate gla&s;s
ve&s;&s;els, he kept them for &s;ome days without food. In about five days one
of them brought forth thirty-eight young ones, well &s;haped, and of a
milk-white colour, which changed every day more and <PB N="300" REF="309"> more
into a dark ru&s;ty hue. Another female, in a different ve&s;&s;el, brought
forth twenty-&s;even of the &s;ame colour; and the day following the young ones
&s;eemed all fixed to the back and belly of the female. For near a fortnight
all the&s;e continued alive and well; but afterwards &s;ome of them died daily:
until, in about a month, they all died, except two.</P>
<P>Were it worth the trouble, the&s;e animals might be kept
living as long as curio&s;ity &s;hould think proper. Their chief food is worms
and in&s;ects; and upon a proper &s;upply of the&s;e, their lives might be
lengthened to their natural extent. How long that may be we are not told; but
if we may argue from analogy, it cannot be le&s;s than &s;even or eight years;
and perhaps, in the larger kind, double that duration. As they have &s;omewhat
the form of the lob&s;ter, &s;o they re&s;emble that animal in ca&s;ting their
&s;hell, or more properly their &s;kin; &s;ince it is &s;ofter by far than the
covering of the lob&s;ter, and &s;et with hairs, which grow from it in great
abun|dance, particularly at the joinings. The young lie in the womb of the
parent, each covered up in its own membrane, to the number of forty or fifty,
and united to each other by an oblong thread, &s;o as to exhibit altogether the
form of a chaplet.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="310">Such is the manner in which the common
&s;corpion produces its young: but there is a &s;corpion of America, produced
from the egg, in the manner of the &s;pider. The eggs are no larger than pins
points; and they are depo&s;ited in a web, which they &s;pin from their bodies,
and carry about with them, till they are hatched. As &s;oon as the young ones
are excluded from the &s;hell, they get upon the back of the parent, who turns
her tail over them, and defends them with her &s;ting. It &s;eems probable,
therefore, that captivity produces that unnatural di&s;po|&s;ition in the
&s;corpion, which induces it to de&s;troy its young; &s;ince, at liberty, it is
found to protect them with &s;uch uncea&s;ing a&s;&s;iduity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. Of the Scolopendra and Gally-worm.</HEAD>
<P>OF the&s;e hideous and angry in&s;ects we know little, except
the figure and the noxious qua|lities. Though with us there are in&s;ects
&s;ome|what re&s;embling them in form, we are placed at an happy di&s;tance
from &s;uch as are really for|midable. With us they &s;eldom grow above an inch
long; in the tropical climates they are often found above a quarter of a
yard.</P>
<P>The Scolopendra is otherwi&s;e called the Centipes, from the
number of its feet; and it is very common in many parts of the world,
e&s;pecially between the tropics. Tho&s;e of the Ea&s;t-Indies, where they grow
to the large&s;t &s;ize, are about &s;ix inches long, of a ruddy colour, and as
thick as a man's finger: they con&s;i&s;t of many joints; and from each joint
is a leg on each &s;ide: they are covered with hair, and &s;eem to have no
eyes; but there are two feelers on the head, which they make u&s;e of to find
out the way they are to pa&s;s: the head is very round, with two &s;mall
&s;harp teeth, with which they inflict wounds that are very painful and
dan|gerous. A &s;ailor that was bit by one on board <PB N="303" REF="312"> a
&s;hip, felt an exce&s;&s;ive pain, and his life was &s;uppo&s;ed to be in
danger: however, he recovered, by the application of three roa&s;ted onions to
the part; and was &s;oon quite well. Of this ani|mal there are different kinds;
&s;ome living, like worms, in holes in the earth; others under &s;tones, and
among rotten wood: &s;o that nothing is more dangerous than removing tho&s;e
&s;ub&s;tances, in the places where they breed.</P>
<P>The Gally-worm differs from the &s;colopendra, in having
double the number of feet; there be|ing two on each &s;ide, to every joint of
the body. Some of the&s;e are &s;mooth, and others hairy; &s;ome are yellow,
&s;ome black, and &s;ome brown. They are found among decayed trees, between the
wood and the bark; as al&s;o among &s;tones that are covered with mo&s;s. They
all, when touched, contract them&s;elves, rolling them&s;elves up like a ball.
Whatever may be their qualities in the tropical parts of the world, in Europe
they are perfectly harmle&s;s; having been often handled and irritated, without
any vindictive con&s;equences.</P>
<P>All the&s;e, as well as the &s;corpion, are &s;up|po&s;ed to
be produced perfect from the parent, or the egg; and to undergo no changes,
after their fir&s;t exclu&s;ion. They are &s;een of all &s;izes; 
<PB N="304" REF="313"> and this is a &s;ufficient inducement to &s;uppo&s;e,
that they pre&s;erve their fir&s;t appearance, through the whole of their
exi&s;tence. It is probable, however, that, like mo&s;t of this cla&s;s, they
often change their &s;kins; but of this we have no certain information.</P>

<PB N="305" REF="314">
<HEAD>CHAP. XI. Of the Leech.</HEAD>
<P>THE la&s;t of this wingle&s;s tribe that I &s;hall mention is
the Leech, which, like all the former, undergoes no varieties of
transformation; but when once excluded from the body of the pa|rent,
pre&s;erves its fir&s;t figure to the end. I place the hi&s;tory of the leech
among the fir&s;t cla&s;s of in&s;ects; while I have degraded the Earth-worm,
the Taenia, and the Polypus, into the cla&s;s of zoophytes, or that imperfect
tribe which &s;erves to make the &s;hade between animal and vegetable nature.
Not but that the earth-worm or the polypus have their motions, their appetites,
and their vital principles, as compleat as the leech, and to a cur&s;ory view
appear every way as compleat animals. But there is one circum|&s;tance that
lays the line between them; that exalts the one and degrades the other. The
earth-worm and the polypus may be cut into pieces, and each piece will produce
a new and perfect animal: the leech cannot &s;uffer this di&s;&s;ection, but
dies when cut in two; an evident in&s;tance that it is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a
more perfect <PB N="306" REF="315"> organization than tho&s;e animals which it
other|wi&s;e very much re&s;embles.</P>
<P>The leech, from its u&s;es in medicine, is one of tho&s;e
in&s;ects that man has taken care to pro|vide; but of a great variety, one kind
only is con&s;idered as &s;erviceable. The hor&s;e-leech, which is the
large&s;t of all, and grows to four inches in length, with a glo&s;&s;y black
&s;urface, is of no u&s;e, as it will not &s;tick to the &s;kin; the
&s;nail-leech is but an inch in length; and though it will &s;tick, is not
large enough to extract a &s;ufficient quantity of blood from the patient; the
broad tailed leech, which grows to an inch and an half in length, with the back
rai&s;ed into a &s;ort of a ridge, will &s;tick but on very few occa&s;ions: it
is the large brown leech, with a whiti&s;h belly, that is made u&s;e of in
medicine, and who&s;e hi&s;tory be&s;t merits our curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>The leech has the general figure of a worm, and is about as
long as one's middle finger. Its &s;kin is compo&s;ed of rings, by means of
which it is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of its agility, and &s;wims in water. It
contracts it&s;elf, when out of water, in &s;uch a manner, that when touched it
is not above an inch long. It has a &s;mall head, and a black &s;kin, edged
with a yellow line on each &s;ide, with &s;ome yellowi&s;h &s;pots on the back.
The belly al&s;o, which is <PB N="307" REF="316"> of a reddi&s;h colour, is
marked with whiti&s;h yellow &s;pots. But the mo&s;t remarkable part of this
animal is the mouth, which is compo&s;ed of two lips, that take whatever form
the in&s;ect finds convenient. When at re&s;t, the opening is u&s;ually
triangular; and within it are placed three very &s;harp teeth, capable of
piercing not only the human &s;kin, but al&s;o that of an hor&s;e or an ox.
Still deeper in the head, is di&s;co|vered the tongue, which is compo&s;ed of a
&s;trong fle&s;hy &s;ub&s;tance, and which &s;erves to a&s;&s;i&s;t the animal
in &s;ucking, when it has inflicted its triple wound; for no &s;ooner is this
voracious creature applied to the &s;kin, than it buries its teeth therein,
then clo&s;es its lips round the wounds which it has made; and thus, in the
manner of a cupping-gla&s;s, extracts the blood as it flows to the different
orifices.</P>
<P>In examining this animal's form farther to|wards the tail, it
is &s;een to have a gullet and an inte&s;tinal canal, into which the blood
flows in great abundance. On each &s;ide of this are &s;een running along
&s;everal little bladders, which, when the animal is empty, &s;eem to be filled
with nothing but water; but when it is gorging blood, they &s;eem to
communicate with the inte&s;tines, and receive a large portion of the blood
which flows into the body. If the&s;e bladders &s;hould be 
<PB N="308" REF="317"> con&s;idered as &s;o many &s;tomachs, then every leech
will be found to have twenty-four. But what is mo&s;t extraordinary of all in
this animal's formation is, that though it takes &s;o large a quantity of food,
it has no anus or pa&s;&s;age to eject it from the body when it has been
dige&s;ted. On the contrary, the blood which the leech has thus &s;ucked
remains for &s;everal months clotted within its body, blackened a little by the
change, but no way putrefied, and very little altered in its texture or
con&s;i&s;tence. In what manner it pa&s;&s;es through the animal's body, or how
it contributes to its nouri&s;hment, is not ea&s;ily accounted for. The water
in which they are kept is very little di&s;coloured by their continuance; they
cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to return the blood by the &s;ame pa&s;&s;age through
which it was taken in; it only remains, therefore, that it goes off through the
pores of the body, and that the&s;e are &s;ufficiently large to permit its
exclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>But it is not in this in&s;tance alone that the leech differs
from all other in&s;ects. It was remarked in a former chapter, that the whole
in&s;ect tribe had the opening into their lungs placed in their &s;ides, and
that they breathed through tho&s;e apertures as other animals through the
mouth. A drop of oil poured on the &s;ides <PB N="309" REF="318"> of a wa&s;p,
a bee, or a worm, would quickly &s;uffocate them, by &s;topping up the
pa&s;&s;ages through which they breathe; but it is otherwi&s;e with the leech,
for this animal may be im|mer&s;ed in oil without injury; nay, it will live
therein; and the only damage it will &s;u&s;tain is, that when taken out it
will be &s;een to ca&s;t a fine pelucid &s;kin exactly of the &s;hape of the
animal, after which it is as alert and vigorous as before. It appears from
hence that the leech breathes through the mouth; and, in fact, it has a motion
that &s;eems to re&s;emble the act of re&s;piration in more perfect animals:
but concerning all this we are very much in the dark.</P>
<P>This animal &s;eems to differ from all others in &s;everal
re&s;pects; the re&s;t of the reptile tribe are brought forth from eggs; the
leech is vi|viparous, and produces its young one after the other, to the number
of forty or fifty at a birth. It is probable that, like the &s;nail, each
in&s;ect contains the two &s;exes, and that it im|gregnates and is impregnated
in the &s;ame man|ner. The young ones are chiefly found in the month of July,
in &s;hallow running waters, and particularly where they are tepified by the
rays of the &s;un. The large ones are chiefly &s;ought after; and being put
into a gla&s;s ve&s;&s;el <PB N="310" REF="319"> filled with water, they remain
for months, nay for years, without taking any other &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. But they
never breed in this confinement; and, con&s;equently, what regards that part of
their hi&s;tory &s;till remains ob&s;cure.</P>
<P>In this part of the world they &s;eldom grow to above four
inches; but in America and the Ea&s;t they are found from &s;ix to &s;even.
Their pools there abound with them in &s;uch numbers, that it would be
dangerous bathing there, if for no other con&s;ideration. Our &s;ailors and
&s;oldiers, who the la&s;t war were obliged to walk in tho&s;e countries
through mar&s;hy grounds, talk with terror of the number of leeches that
infe&s;ted them on their march. Even in &s;ome parts of Europe they encrea&s;e
&s;o as to become formidable. Sedelius, a German phy&s;ician, relates, that a
girl of nine years old, who was keeping &s;heep near the city of Bom&s;t in
Poland, perceiving a &s;oldier making up to her, went to hide her&s;elf in a
neighbouring mar&s;h among &s;ome bu&s;hes; but the number of leeches was &s;o
great in this place, and they &s;tuck to her &s;o clo&s;e, that the poor
creature expired from the quantity of blood which &s;he lo&s;t by their united
efforts. Nor is this much to be wondered at, &s;ince one of tho&s;e in&s;ects
that when empty ge|nerally weighs but a &s;cruple, will, when gorged, weigh
more than two drachms.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="320">When leeches are to be applied, the
be&s;t way is to take them from the water in which they are contained about an
hour before, for they thus become more voracious and fa&s;ten more readily.
When &s;aturated with blood, they generally fall off of them&s;elves; but if it
be thought nece&s;&s;ary to take them from the wound, care &s;hould be u&s;ed
to pull them very gently, or even to &s;prinkle them with &s;alt if they
continue to adhere; for if they be plucked rudely away, it mo&s;t frequently
happens that they leave their teeth in the wound, which makes a very
trouble&s;ome inflammation, and is often attended with danger. If they be
&s;low in fixing to the part, they are often enticed by rubbing it with milk or
blood, or water mixed with &s;ugar. As &s;alt is a poi&s;on to mo&s;t
in&s;ects, many people throw it upon the leech when it has dropped from the
wound, by which means it di&s;gorges the blood it has &s;wallowed, and it is
then kept for repeated application. They &s;eldom, however, &s;tick after this
operation; and as the price is but &s;mall, fre&s;h leeches &s;hould always be
applied whenever &s;uch an ap|plication is thought nece&s;&s;ary.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of the &s;econd Order of In&s;ects.</HEAD>
<P>IN the former part we gave a conci&s;e hi&s;tory of the mo&s;t
con&s;iderable in&s;ects that, without wings, were produced in a perfect
&s;tate; either from the body of the parent alive, like qua|drupedes, or from
the egg, in the manner of birds. We come now to a &s;econd order of in&s;ects,
that are produced from the egg, like the former, but not in a perfect &s;tate;
for when fir&s;t excluded, they are without wings. This, however, does not
hinder the exerci&s;e of their animal functions; the in&s;ect, although not yet
come to perfection, walks, leaps, and eats; nor is it ever deprived of motion,
only that it re&s;ts a little when it is about to ca&s;t that part of its
&s;kin previous to its &s;tate of perfection. It is then &s;een to a&s;&s;ume
two wings, which, like a budding flower, bur&s;t through the ca&s;e that
contained them, and the animal becomes a winged in&s;ect in its &s;tate of
highe&s;t perfection. To this order we may refer the Libella, or Dragon-Fly;
the Formica Leo, or Lion-Ant; the Gra&s;hopper; the Locu&s;t; the Cricket; the
Wood-Cricket; the Mole-Cricket; the Flea-Locu&s;t; the Flying-Bug; the Tipula;
the Water-Scorpion; the Notonecta, or Water-Fly, and many others.</P>

<PB N="316" REF="323">
<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the Libella or Dragon-Fly.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the flies which adorn or diver&s;ify the face of
Nature, the&s;e are the mo&s;t various and the mo&s;t beautiful; they are of
all colours; green, blue, crim&s;on, &s;carlet, white; &s;ome unite a variety
of the mo&s;t vivid tints, and ex|hibit in one animal more different &s;hades
than are to be found in the rainbow. They are called, in different parts of the
kingdom, by different names; but none can be at a lo&s;s to know them, as they
are di&s;tingui&s;hed from all other flies by the length of their bodies, by
the largene&s;s of their eyes, and the beautiful tran&s;|parency of their
wings, which are four in number. They are &s;een in &s;ummer flying with great
rapidity near every hedge, and by every running brook; they &s;ometimes
&s;ettle on the leaves of plants, and &s;ometimes keep for hours together on
the wing.</P>
<P>Dragon-flies, though there are three or four different kinds,
yet agree in the mo&s;t &s;triking parts of their hi&s;tory, and one account
may &s;erve for all. The large&s;t &s;ort are generally found from two to three
inches long; their tail <PB N="317" REF="324"> is forked; their body divided
into eleven rings; their eyes are large, horny, and tran&s;parent, divided by a
number of inter&s;ections; and their wings, that always lie flat when they are
at re&s;t, are of a beautiful glo&s;&s;y tran&s;parency; &s;ometimes &s;hining
like &s;ilver, and &s;ometimes gli&s;tening like gold. Within the mouth are to
be &s;een two teeth covered with a beautiful lip: with the&s;e the creatures
bite fiercely when they are taken; but their bite is perfectly harmle&s;s, as I
have experienced more than once.</P>
<P>The&s;e in&s;ects, beautiful as they are, are pro|duced from
eggs, which are depo&s;ited in the water, where they remain for &s;ome time
with|out &s;eeming life or motion. They are ejected by the female into the
water in clu&s;ters, like a bunch of grapes, where they &s;ink to the bottom by
their natural weight, and continue in that &s;tate till the young ones find
&s;trength enough to break the &s;hell, and to &s;eparate from each other. The
form in which they fir&s;t &s;hew life is that of a worm with &s;ix legs,
bearing a &s;trong re&s;emblance to the dragon-fly in its winged &s;tate,
except that the wings are yet concealed within a &s;heath peculiar to this
ani|mal. The rudiments of the&s;e appear in bunches on the back, within which
the wings are folded up into each other, while all the colours and 
<PB N="318" REF="325"> varieties of painting appear tran&s;parent through the
&s;kin. The&s;e animals, upon quitting the egg, &s;till continue in the water,
where they creep and &s;wim, but do not move &s;wiftly. They have likewi&s;e a
&s;harp &s;ight, and imme|diately &s;ink to the bottom, if any one comes to the
places wherein they live, or when|ever they perceive the lea&s;t uncommon
object. Their food at that time is &s;oft mud and the glu|tinous earthy
&s;ub&s;tances that are found at the bottom.</P>
<P>When the&s;e animals prepare to change from their reptile to
their flying &s;tate, they then move out of the water to a dry place; as into
gra&s;s; to pieces of wood, &s;tone, or any thing el&s;e they meet with. They
there firmly fix their acute claws; and, for a &s;hort time, con|tinue quite
immoveable, as if meditating on the change they are to undergo. It is then
ob&s;erved, that the &s;kin fir&s;t opens on the head and back; and out of this
opening they exhibit their real head and eyes, and at length their &s;ix legs;
whil&s;t, in the mean time, the hollow and empty &s;kin, or &s;lough of their
legs, remains firmly fixed in its place. After this, the enclo&s;ed creature
creeps forward by degrees; and by this means draws fir&s;t its wings and then
its body out of the &s;kin; and proceeding a little <PB N="319" REF="326">
farther, &s;its at re&s;t for &s;ome time, as if im|moveable. During this time,
the wings, which were moi&s;t and folded, begin by degrees to expand
them&s;elves, and to make &s;mooth and even all tho&s;e plaits which were laid
again&s;t each other, like a clo&s;ed fan. The body is likewi&s;e
in&s;en&s;ibly extended, until all the limbs have obtained their proper &s;ize
and dimen&s;ions. All the&s;e &s;urprizing and difficult operations are
accompli&s;hed by the force of the blood and the circulating humours. The
creature cannot at fir&s;t make u&s;e of its new wings, and therefore is forced
to &s;tay in the &s;ame place until all its limbs are dried by the
circumambient air. It &s;oon, however, begins to enter upon a more noble life
than it had hitherto led in the bottom of the brook; and from creeping &s;lowly
and living accidentally, it now wings the air, and makes choice from amid&s;t
the variety of its provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>Indeed, no animal is more amply fitted for motion,
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence and enjoyment. As it haunts and &s;eeks after its food flying
in the air, Nature has provided it with two large eyes, which make almo&s;t the
whole head, and which re&s;emble glittering mother of pearl. It has al&s;o four
expan&s;ive &s;ilver-coloured wings, with which, as with oars, it can turn
it&s;elf with pro|digious <PB N="318" REF="327">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"> <PB N="319" REF="328">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"> <PB REF="329"> velocity; and to
a&s;&s;i&s;t the&s;e, it is fur|ni&s;hed with a very long body, which, like a
rudder, directs its motions. As the wings, are long, and the legs &s;hort, they
&s;eldom walk, but are ever &s;een either re&s;ting or flying. For this
rea&s;on, they always chu&s;e dry branches of trees or &s;hrubs to remain on;
and when they have refre&s;hed them&s;elves a little, they renew their flight.
Thus they are &s;een adorning the &s;ummer with a profu&s;ion of beauty,
lightly traver&s;ing the air in a thou&s;and direc|tions, and expanding the
mo&s;t beautiful colours to the &s;un. The garden, the fore&s;t, the hedges,
and the rivulets, are animated by their &s;ports; and there are few who have
been brought up in the country, who have not employed a part of their childhood
in the pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>But while the&s;e beautiful flies appear to us &s;o idly and
innocently employed, they are in fact the greate&s;t tyrants of the in&s;ect
tribe; and, like the hawk among birds, are only hovering up and down to &s;eize
their prey. They are the &s;tronge&s;t and the mo&s;t courageous of all winged
in&s;ects; nor is there one, how large &s;oever, that they will not attack and
devour. The blue fly, the bee, the wa&s;p, and the hornet, make their
con&s;tant prey; and even the butterfly, that &s;preads &s;o large a wing, is
often caught <PB N="321" REF="330"> and treated without mercy. Their appetite
&s;eems to know no bounds; they &s;pend the whole day in the pur&s;uit, and
have been &s;een to devour three times their own &s;ize in the cap|ture of a
&s;ingle hour. They &s;eize their prey flying with their &s;ix claws, and tear
it ea&s;ily to pieces with their teeth, which are capable of inflicting
trouble&s;ome wounds.</P>
<P>But the males are upon the wing for another purpo&s;e be&s;ide
that of food, as they are very &s;alacious, and &s;eek the females with great
ar|dour. The &s;un no &s;ooner begins to warm the fields, than the mates are
found a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly employed each in &s;eeking its mate; and no &s;ooner
does a female appear, but two or three males are &s;een pur&s;uing and
endeavouring to &s;eize her with all their arts and agility. The in&s;trument
of generation in the male is placed very different from that of any other
in&s;ect, being not at the end of the tail as in others, but immediately under
the brea&s;t, and con&s;e|quently, at fir&s;t view, incapable of being united
to the &s;exual part of the female; which, as in other in&s;ects, lies in the
tail. To perform this junction, Nature has provided the male with a very
peculiar manner of proceeding. As &s;oon as he perceives the female, and finds
him|&s;elf &s;ufficiently near, he &s;eizes upon the back <PB N="322" REF="331"> of her head by &s;urprize, and fa&s;tening his claws upon her, turns
round his forky tail, which he fa&s;tens round her neck, and in this manner
fixes him&s;elf &s;o clo&s;ely and firmly, that no efforts can remove him. It
is in vain that &s;he flies from one branch to another and &s;ettles upon them,
he &s;till keeps fixed, and often continues in this &s;ituation for three or
four hours &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively. When he flies, &s;he is obliged to fly with
him; but he &s;till directs the way: and though &s;he moves her wings, &s;he
&s;eems entirely guided by his motions. As yet, however, the bu&s;ine&s;s of
impregnation is not performed; for to this the female mu&s;t contribute; and
&s;he at la&s;t &s;eems, by the continuance of her con&s;traint, to comply:
for, turning up the end of her tail to that part of the brea&s;t of the male in
which lies the part proper for generation, both in&s;truments meet, and the
eggs of the female receive the nece&s;&s;ary fecundation. An hour or two after
this, &s;he flies to &s;ome neigh|bouring pool, where &s;he depo&s;ites her
eggs, as was already mentioned. There they continue in a reptile &s;tate for a
year; and then are changed into a beautiful fly, re&s;embling the parent.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="323" REF="332">
<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of the Formica Leo, or Lion-Ant.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH this animal properly belongs to no order of
in&s;ects, yet, as it is changed into a fly very much re&s;embling that
de&s;cribed in the preceding chapter, it may not be improper to give its
hi&s;tory here. If we con&s;ider the life of this animal in its different
&s;tages of exi&s;tence, we &s;hall find it equally wonderful in all; but as it
changes to a dragon-fly, what we have &s;aid of that animal above need not be
repeated here. The ant-lion, when it becomes an in|habitant of air, in every
re&s;pect re&s;embles that which has been already de&s;cribed; its glo&s;&s;y
wings, its voracious appetites, its peculiar manner of generation, are entirely
the &s;ame. It is in its reptile &s;tate that it differs from all other
in&s;ects; and in that &s;tate it will be amu&s;ing to pur&s;ue its
hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The ant-lion, in its reptile &s;tate, is of the &s;ize of a
common wood-lou&s;e, but &s;omewhat broader. It has a pretty long head and a
roundi&s;h body, which becomes a little narrower towards the tail. The colour
is a dirty grey, &s;peckled with black, and the body is compo&s;ed 
<PB N="324" REF="333"> of &s;everal flat rings, which &s;lip one upon ano|ther.
It has &s;ix feet, four of which are fixed to the brea&s;t and two to the neck.
The head is &s;mall and flat, and before there are two little &s;mooth horns or
feelers, which are hard, about a quarter of an inch long, and crooked at the
ends. At the ba&s;is of the feelers there are two &s;mall black lively eyes, by
which it can &s;ee the &s;malle&s;t object, as is ea&s;ily di&s;covered by its
&s;tarting from every thing that approaches.</P>
<P>To a form &s;o unpromi&s;ing, and &s;o ill provided for the
purpo&s;es of rapacity, this animal unites the mo&s;t ravenous appetites in
nature; but to mark its imbecillity &s;till &s;tronger, as other ani|mals have
wings or feet to enable them to ad|vance towards their prey, the ant-lion is
un|provided with &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance from either. It has legs indeed; but
the&s;e only enable it to run backward, &s;o that it could as &s;oon die as
make the &s;malle&s;t progre&s;&s;ive motion. Thus, fami&s;hed and rapacious as
it ever &s;eems, its prey mu&s;t come to it, or rather into the &s;nare
provided for it, or the in&s;idious a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in mu&s;t &s;tarve.</P>
<P>But Nature, that has denied it &s;trength or &s;wiftne&s;s,
has given it an equivalent in cunning, &s;o that no animal fares more
&s;umptuou&s;ly, with|out ever &s;tirring from its retreat. For this 
<PB N="325" REF="334"> purpo&s;e, it chu&s;es a dry &s;andy place, at the foot
of a wall, or under &s;ome &s;helter, in order to pre&s;erve its machinations
from the rain. The drie&s;t and mo&s;t &s;andy &s;pot is the mo&s;t proper for
it; becau&s;e a heavy clogged earth would defeat its labour. When it goes about
to dig the hole where it takes its prey, it begins to bend the hinder part of
its body, which is pointed, and thus works backward; making, after &s;everal
attempts, a circular fur|row, which &s;erves to mark out the &s;ize of the hole
it intends making, as the ancients marked out the limits of a city with the
plough. Within this fir&s;t furrow it digs a &s;econd; then a third; and
afterwards others, which are always le&s;s than the preceding. Then it begins
to deepen its hole, &s;inking lower and lower into the &s;and, which it throws
with its horns, or feelers, to|wards the edges, as we &s;ee men throw up &s;and
in a gravel-pit. Thus, by repeating its labours all round, the &s;and is thrown
up in a circle about the edge of the pit, until the whole is quite compleated.
This hole is always formed in a perfect circle; and the pit it&s;elf
re&s;embles the in&s;ide of an inverted funnel. When this in&s;ect fir&s;t
leaves the egg and is newly hatched, the fir&s;t pit it makes is very &s;mall;
but as it grows bigger, it makes a larger hole; which <PB N="326" REF="335"> is
de&s;tined, like a pit-fall, to entrap its prey. It is generally about two
inches deep, and as much in diameter.</P>
<P>The work being thus with great labour fini&s;hed, the
in&s;idious in&s;ect places it&s;elf in ambu&s;h, hiding it&s;elf at the bottom
under the &s;and in &s;uch a manner, that its two horns encircle the bottom of
the pit. All the &s;ides of this pit-fall are made of the mo&s;t loo&s;e and
crumbling materials; &s;o that &s;carce any in&s;ect can climb up that has once
got down to the bottom. Con&s;cious of this, the ant-lion re|mains in patient
expectation, ready to profit by that accident which throws &s;ome heedle&s;s
little animal into its den. If then, by misfor|tune, an ant, a wood-lou&s;e, or
a &s;mall cater|pillar walks too near the edge of the precipice, the &s;and
gives way beneath them, and they fall to the bottom of the pit, where they meet
inevitable de&s;truction. The fall of a &s;ingle grain of &s;and gives the
murderer notice at the bottom of its cave; and it never fails to &s;ally forth
to &s;eize upon its prey. It happens &s;ome|times, however, that the ant or the
wood-lou&s;e is too nimble, and runs up the &s;ides of the pit|fall before the
other can make ready to &s;eize it. The ant-lion has then another contrivance,
&s;till more wonderful than the former; for, by means <PB N="327" REF="336"> of
its broad head and feelers, it has a method of throwing up a &s;hower of &s;and
which falls upon the &s;truggling captive with tremendous weight, and once more
cru&s;hes it down to the bottom. When the in&s;ect is once fallen thus low, no
efforts can retrieve or relea&s;e it; the ant-lion &s;eizes it with its
feelers, which are hollow, and darting them both into its body, &s;ucks out all
the little animal's juices with the utmo&s;t rapacity.</P>
<P>When the prey is thus reduced to a hu&s;k, and nothing but the
external form remains, the next care of the murderer is to remove the body from
its cell; &s;ince the appearance of dead car|ca&s;es might forewarn other
in&s;ects of the danger of the place. The in&s;ect, therefore, takes up the
wa&s;ted trunk with its feelers, and throws it, with wonderful &s;trength, at
lea&s;t &s;ix inches from the edge of its hole; and then patiently &s;ets about
mending the breaches which its forti|fications had received in the la&s;t
engagement. Nothing can abate its indu&s;try, its vigilance, its patience, or
its rapacity. It will work for a week together to make its pit-fall; it will
continue upon the watch for more than a month, pa|tiently expecting the
approach of its prey; and if it comes in greater quantities than is needful,
yet &s;till the little voracious creature will quit the <PB N="328" REF="337">
in&s;ect it has newly killed, and leave it half eaten, to kill and attack any
other that happens to fall within the &s;phere of its malignity: yet, though
&s;o voracious, it is &s;urprizingly patient of hunger; &s;ome of them having
been kept in a box with &s;and for &s;ix months and upwards, without feeding at
all.</P>
<P>When the ant-lion attains a certain age, in which it is to
change into another form, it then leaves off its u&s;ual rapacious habits, but
keeps on its indu&s;try. It no longer continues to make pits, but furrows up
the &s;and all round in an irregular manner; te&s;tifying tho&s;e work|ings and
violent agitations which mo&s;t in&s;ects exhibit previous to their
transformation. The&s;e animals are produced in autumn, and generally live a
year, and perhaps two, before they a&s;&s;ume a winged form. Certain it is,
that they are found at the end of winter of all &s;izes; and it would &s;eem
that many of the &s;maller kinds had not yet attained &s;ufficient maturity for
tran&s;|formation. Be this as it may, when the time of change approaches, if
the in&s;ect finds its little cell convenient, it &s;eeks no other: if it is
obliged to remove, after furrowing up the &s;and, it hides it&s;elf under it,
horns and all. It there &s;pins a thread, in the manner of the &s;pider; which
being made of a glutinous &s;ub&s;tance, and being humid <PB N="329" REF="338">
from the moi&s;ture of its body, &s;ticks to the little particles of &s;and
among which it is &s;pun; and in proportion as it is thus excluded, the
in&s;ect rolls up its web, &s;and and all, into a ball, of which it&s;elf is
the center. This ball is about half an inch in diameter; and within it the
in&s;ect re|&s;ides, in an apartment &s;ufficiently &s;pacious for all its
motions. The out&s;ide is compo&s;ed of &s;and and &s;ilk; the in&s;ide is
lined with &s;ilk only, of a fine pearl colour, extremely delicate, and
perfectly beautiful. But though the work is &s;o curious within, it exhibits
nothing to external appearance, but a lump of &s;and; and thus e&s;capes the
&s;earch of birds, that might otherwi&s;e di&s;turb the inhabitant within.</P>
<P>The in&s;ect continues thus &s;hut up for &s;ix weeks or two
months; and gradually parts with its eyes, its feelers, its feet, and its
&s;kin; all which are thru&s;t into a corner of the inner apart|ment, like a
rag. The in&s;ect then appears almo&s;t in its winged &s;tate, except that
there is a thin &s;kin which wraps up the wings, and that appears to be nothing
el&s;e but a liquor dried on their out&s;ide. Still, however, the little animal
is too delicate and tender to venture from its retreat; but continues
enclo&s;ed for &s;ome time longer: at length, when the members of this new
in&s;ect have acquired the nece&s;&s;ary con|&s;i&s;tence <PB N="330" REF="339"> and vigour, it tears open its lodging, and breaks through its wall.
For this purpo&s;e it has two teeth, like tho&s;e of gra&s;hoppers, with which
it eats through, and enlarges the opening, till it gets out. Its body, which is
turned like a &s;crew, takes up no more than the &s;pace of a quarter of an
inch; but when it is unfolded, it becomes half an inch in length; while its
wings, that &s;eemed to occupy the &s;malle&s;t &s;pace, in two minutes time
unfold, and become longer than the body. In &s;hort, it becomes a large and
beautiful fly of the libellula kind, with a long, &s;lender body, of a brown
colour; a &s;mall head, with large bright eyes, long &s;lender legs, and four
large tran&s;parent, reticulated wings. The re&s;t of its habits re&s;emble
that in&s;ect who&s;e form it bears; except, that in&s;tead of dropping its
eggs in the water, it depo&s;ites them in &s;and, where they are &s;oon hatched
into that rapacious in&s;ect &s;o ju&s;tly admired for its method of catch|ing
its prey.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of the Gra&s;shopper, the Locu&s;t, the Cicada,
the Cricket, and the Mole Cricket.</HEAD>
<P>BELONGING to the &s;econd order of in&s;ects, we find a tribe
of little animals, which, though differing in &s;ize and colour, &s;trongly
re&s;emble each other in figure, appetites, nature, and transformation. But
though they all appear of one family, yet man has been taught to hold them in
different e&s;timation; for while &s;ome of this tribe amu&s;e him with their
chirpings, and bani&s;h &s;olitude from the fields, others come in &s;warms,
eat up every thing that is green, and in a &s;ingle night convert the mo&s;t
delightful land&s;cape into a dreary wa&s;te. However, if the&s;e animals be
&s;eparately con&s;idered, the de|vouring locu&s;t is not in the lea&s;t more
mi&s;|chievous than the mu&s;ical gra&s;shopper; the only difference is, that
one &s;pecies come for food in a &s;warm, the other feeds &s;ingly.</P>
<P>That animal which is called the gra&s;shopper with us, differs
greatly from the cicada of an|tiquity; for as our in&s;ect is active enough in
hopping through the long gra&s;s, from whence it has taken its name, the cicada
had not this <PB N="332" REF="341"> power, but either walked or flew. The
little hi&s;&s;ing note al&s;o of our gra&s;shopper is very dif|ferent from the
&s;ong of the cicada, which was louder and far more mu&s;ical. The manner in
which this note is produced by the two animals is very different; for the
cicada makes it by a kind of buckler, which the male has beneath its belly; the
gra&s;shopper by a tran&s;parent membrane that covers an hole at the ba&s;e of
its wings. There is &s;till a greater variety in all the&s;e with regard to
&s;hape and colour. Some are green, &s;ome black, &s;ome livid, and &s;ome
variegated; but many of them do not &s;hew all their colours till they fly.
Some have long legs, &s;ome &s;hort; &s;ome with more joints, others with
fewer. Some &s;ing, others are mute; &s;ome are innocent, doing no damage to
the hu&s;band|man; while others do &s;uch prodigious mi&s;chief, that they are
looked upon in &s;ome countries as one of the terrible &s;courges of the
incen&s;ed Divinity.</P>
<P>Of this variegated tribe, the little gra&s;shopper that breeds
in &s;uch plenty in every meadow, and that continues its chirping through the
&s;ummer, is be&s;t known to us; and by having its hi&s;tory we &s;hall be
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that of all the re&s;t. This animal is of the colour of
green leaves, except a line of brown which &s;treaks <PB N="333" REF="342"> the
back, and two pale lines under the belly and behind the legs. It may be divided
into the head, the cor&s;let, and the belly. The head is oblong, regarding the
earth, and bearing &s;ome re&s;emblance to that of a hor&s;e. Its mouth is
covered by a kind of round buckler jutting over it, and armed with teeth of a
brown co|lour, hooked at the points. Within the mouth is perceivable a large
reddi&s;h tongue, and fixed to the lower jaw. The feelers or horns are very
long, tapering off to a point; and the eyes are like two black &s;pecks, a
little prominent. The cor&s;let is elevated, narrow, armed above and below, by
two &s;errated &s;pines. The back is armed with a &s;trong buckler, to which
the mu&s;cles of the legs are firmly bound, and round the&s;e mu&s;cles are
&s;een the ve&s;&s;els by which the animal breathes, as white as &s;now. The
la&s;t pair of legs are much longer and &s;tronger than the fir&s;t two pair,
fortified by thick mu&s;cles, and very well formed for leaping. It has four
wings; the anterior ones &s;pringing from the &s;econd pair of legs, the
po&s;terior from the third pair The hinder wings are much finer and more
expan&s;ive than the foremo&s;t, and are the principal in&s;truments of its
flight. The belly is con&s;iderably large, compo&s;ed of eight rings, and
terminated by a forky tail, covered with <PB N="334" REF="343"> down, like the
tail of a rat. When examined internally, be&s;ides the gullet, we di&s;cover a
&s;mall &s;tomach; and behind that a very large one, wrinkled and furrowed
within &s;ide: lower down there is &s;till a third; &s;o that it is not without
rea&s;on that all the animals of this order are &s;aid to chew the cud, as they
&s;o much re&s;emble rumi|nant animals in their internal conformation.</P>
<P>A &s;hort time after the gra&s;shopper a&s;&s;umes its wings,
it fills the meadow with its note; which, like that among birds, is a call to
court|&s;hip. The male only of this tribe is vocal; and, upon examining at the
ba&s;e of the wings, there will be found a little hole in its body, covered
with a fine tran&s;parent membrane. This is thought, by Linnaeus, to be the
in&s;trument it employs in &s;inging; but others are of opinion the &s;ound is
produced by rubbing its hinder legs again&s;t each other: however this be, the
note of one male is &s;eldom heard, but it is re|turned by another; and the two
little animals, after many mutual in&s;ults of this kind, are &s;een to meet
and fight de&s;perately. The female is generally the reward of victory; for,
after the combat, the male &s;eizes her with his teeth behind the neck, and
thus keeps her for &s;everal hours, till the bu&s;ine&s;s of fecundation is
per|formed. They are at that time &s;o &s;trongly <PB N="335" REF="344">
united, that they can &s;carcely be &s;eparated with|out tearing a&s;under.
Towards the latter end of autumn the female prepares to depo&s;ite her burthen;
and her body is then &s;een greatly di&s;tended with her eggs, which &s;he
carries to the number of an hundred and fifty. In order to make a proper
lodgement in the earth for them, Nature has furni&s;hed her with an
in&s;trument at her tail, &s;omewhat re&s;embling a two-edged &s;word, which
&s;he can &s;heathe and un&s;heathe at plea&s;ure: with this &s;he pierces the
earth as deep as &s;he is able; and into the hole which her in&s;trument has
made, &s;he depo&s;ites her eggs, one after the other.</P>
<P>Having thus provided for the continuation of her po&s;terity,
the animal her&s;elf does not long &s;urvive; but, as the winter approaches,
&s;he dries up, &s;eems to feel the effects of age, and dies from a total
decay. Some, however, a&s;&s;ert, that &s;he is killed by the cold; and others,
that &s;he is eaten by worms: but certain it is, that neither the male nor
female are ever &s;een to &s;urvive the winter. In the mean time the eggs which
have been depo&s;ited, continue unaltered, either by the &s;everity of the
&s;ea&s;on, or the retardation of the &s;pring. They are of an oval figure,
white, and of the con&s;i&s;tence of horn: their &s;ize nearly equals that of a
grain of ani&s;e: they are enve|loped <PB N="336" REF="345"> in the body within
a covering, branched all over with veins and arteries; and when ex|cluded, they
crack, on being pre&s;&s;ed between the fingers: their &s;ub&s;tance within is
a whiti&s;h, vi&s;cous and tran&s;parent fluid. In this manner they remain
depo&s;ited beneath the &s;urface of the earth, during the whole winter; till
the genial return of &s;pring begins to vivify and hatch them. The &s;un, with
its warmth, beginning to animate all nature, the in&s;ect eggs feel its benign
influence; and generally, about the beginning of May, every egg produces an
in&s;ect, about the &s;ize of a flea. The&s;e at fir&s;t are of a whiti&s;h
colour; at the end of two or three days they turn black; and &s;oon after they
become of a reddi&s;h brown. They appear, from the be|ginning, like
gra&s;shoppers wanting wings; and hop among the gra&s;s, as &s;oon as excluded,
with great agility.</P>
<P>Yet &s;till they are by no means arrived at their &s;tate of
full perfection; although they bear a &s;trong re&s;emblance to the animal in
its perfect form. They want, or &s;eem to want the wings, which they are at
la&s;t &s;een to a&s;&s;ume; and can only hop among the gra&s;s, without being
able to fly. The wings, however, are not wanting, but are concealed within four
little bunches, that &s;eem to deform the &s;ides of the animal: 
<PB N="337" REF="346"> there they lie rolled up in a mo&s;t curious manner; and
occupying a &s;maller &s;pace than one could conceive who &s;aw them extended.
Indeed, all in&s;ects, whatever tran&s;mutations they &s;eem to undergo, are
yet brought forth with tho&s;e very limbs, parts and wings, which they
afterwards &s;eem to acquire. In the mo&s;t helple&s;s cater|pillar, there is
&s;till to be &s;een the rudiments of that beautiful plumage which it
afterwards ex|pands when a butterfly; and though many new parts &s;eem unfolded
to the view, the animal acquires none but &s;uch as it was from the be|ginning
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. The gra&s;shopper, there|fore, though &s;eemingly without
wings, is in reality, from the fir&s;t, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of tho&s;e
in&s;tru|ments, and only waits for &s;ufficient force to break the bonds that
hold them folded up, and to give them their full expan&s;ion.</P>
<P>The gra&s;shopper, that for above twenty days from its
exclu&s;ion has continued without the u&s;e of its wings, which were folded up
to its body, at length prepares for its emancipation, and for a life of greater
liberty and plea&s;ure. To make the proper di&s;po&s;itions for the
ap|proaching change, it cea&s;es from its gra&s;&s;y food, and &s;eeks about
for a convenient place, beneath &s;ome thorn or thi&s;tle, that may protect it
from an accidental &s;hower. The &s;ame laborious <PB N="338" REF="347">
writhings and workings, heavings and palpi|tations, which we have remarked in
every other in&s;ect upon an approaching change, are ex|hibited in this. It
&s;wells up its head and neck; it then &s;eems to draw them in again; and thus
alternately, for &s;ome time, it exerts its powers to get free. At length, the
&s;kin covering the head and brea&s;t is &s;een dividing above the neck; the
head is &s;een i&s;&s;uing out fir&s;t from the bur&s;ting &s;kin; the efforts
&s;till continuing, the other parts follow &s;ucce&s;&s;ively; &s;o that the
little animal, with its long feelers, legs and all, works its way from the old
&s;kin, that re|mains fixed to the thi&s;tle or the thorn. It is, indeed,
inconceivable how the in&s;ect can thus extricate it&s;elf from &s;o exact a
&s;heath as that which covered every part of its body.</P>
<P>The gra&s;shopper, thus di&s;engaged from its outer &s;kin,
appears in its perfect form; but then &s;o feeble, and its body &s;o &s;oft and
tender, that it may be molded like wax. It is no longer of that ob&s;cure
colour which it exhibited before, but a greeni&s;h white, which becomes more
vivid as the moi&s;ture on the &s;urface is dried away. Still, however, the
animal con|tinues to &s;hew no &s;igns of life, but appears quite &s;pent and
fatigued with its labour for more than an hour together. During this time, 
<PB N="339" REF="348"> the body is drying, and the wings unfolding to their
greate&s;t expan&s;ion, and the curious ob&s;erver will perceive them, fold
after fold, opening to the &s;un, till at la&s;t they become longer than the
two hinder legs. The in&s;ect's body al&s;o is lengthened during this
operation, and it becomes much more beautiful than before.</P>
<P>The&s;e in&s;ects are generally vocal in the mid&s;t of
&s;ummer; and they are heard at &s;un|&s;etting much louder than during the
heats of the day. They are fed upon gra&s;s; and, if their belly be
pre&s;&s;ed, they will be &s;een to re|turn the juices of the plants they have
la&s;t fed upon. Though unwilling to fly, and &s;low in flight, particularly
when the weather is moi&s;t or cool, they are &s;ometimes &s;een to fly to
con|&s;iderable di&s;tances. If they are caught by one of the hinder legs, they
quickly di&s;engage them&s;elves from it, and leave the leg behind them. This,
however, does not grow again, as with crabs or &s;piders; for as they are
animals but of a &s;ingle year's continuance, they have not &s;ufficient time
for repairing tho&s;e accidental misfortunes. The lo&s;s of their leg al&s;o
prevents them from flying; for, being unable to lift them&s;elves in the air,
they have not room upon the ground for the proper expan&s;ion of their 
<PB N="340" REF="349"> wings. If they be handled roughly, they will bite very
fiercely; and when they fly, they make a noi&s;e with their wings. They
generally keep in the plain, where the gra&s;s is luxuriant, and the ground
rich and fertile: there they depo&s;ite their eggs, particularly in tho&s;e
cracks which are formed by the heat of the &s;un.</P>
<P>Such are the habits and nature of tho&s;e little vocal
in&s;ects, that &s;warm in our meadows, and enliven the land&s;cape. The larger
kinds only differ from them in &s;ize, in rapidity of flight, and the powers of
injuring mankind, by &s;warm|ing upon the productions of the earth. The
quantity of gra&s;s which a few gra&s;shoppers that &s;port in the fields can
de&s;troy is trifling; but when a &s;warm of locu&s;ts, two or three miles
long, and &s;everal yards deep, &s;ettle upon a field, the con&s;equences are
frightful. The annals of every country are marked with the deva&s;tation which
&s;uch a multitude of in&s;ects produces; and though they &s;eldom vi&s;it
Europe in &s;uch dangerous &s;warms as formerly, yet, in &s;ome of the
&s;outhern kingdoms, they are &s;till formidable. Tho&s;e which have at
uncertain in|tervals vi&s;ited Europe, in our memory, are &s;up|po&s;ed to have
come from Africa, and the animal is called the Great Brown Locu&s;t. It was
&s;een in &s;everal parts of England in the year 1748, and 
<PB N="341" REF="350"> many dreadful con&s;equences were apprehended from its
appearance. This in&s;ect is about three inches long; and has two horns or
feelers, an inch in length. The head and horns are of a browni&s;h colour; it
is blue about the mouth, as al&s;o on the in&s;ide of the larger legs. The
&s;hield that covers the back is greeni&s;h; and the upper &s;ide of the body
brown, &s;potted with black, and the under &s;ide purple. The upper wings are
brown, with &s;mall du&s;ky &s;pots, with one larger at the tips; the under
wings are more tran&s;parent, and of a light brown, tinctured with green, but
there is a dark cloud of &s;pots near the tips. This is that in&s;ect that has
threatened us &s;o often with its vi&s;itations; and that is &s;o truly
terrible in the countries where it is bred. There is no animal in the creation
that multiplies &s;o fa&s;t as the&s;e, if the &s;un be warm, and the &s;oil in
which their eggs are depo&s;ited be dry. Happily for us, the coldne&s;s of our
climate, and the humidity of our &s;oil, are no way favourable to their
pro|duction; and as they are but the animals of a year, they vi&s;it us and
peri&s;h.</P>
<P>The Scripture, which was written in a country where the
locu&s;t made a di&s;tingui&s;hed feature in the picture of Nature, has given
us &s;everal very &s;triking images of this animal's numbers 
<PB N="342" REF="351"> and rapacity. It compares an army, where the numbers are
almo&s;t infinite, to a &s;warm of lo|cu&s;ts: it de&s;cribes them as ri&s;ing
out of the earth, where they are produced; as pur&s;uing a &s;ettled march to
de&s;troy the fruits of the earth, and co-operate with divine indignation.</P>
<P>When the locu&s;ts take the field, as we are a&s;&s;ured, they
have a leader at their head, who&s;e flight they ob&s;erve, and pay a &s;trict
attention to all his motions. They appear, at a di&s;tance, like a black cloud,
which, as it approaches, gathers upon the horizon, and almo&s;t hides the light
of the day. It often happens that the hu&s;bandman &s;ees this imminent
calamity pa&s;s away without doing him any mi&s;chief; and the whole &s;warm
proceed onward, to &s;ettle upon the labours of &s;ome le&s;s fortunate
country. But wretched is the di&s;trict upon which they &s;ettle: they ravage
the meadow and the pa&s;ture ground; &s;trip the trees of their leaves, and the
garden of its beauty: the vi&s;itation of a few minutes de|&s;troys the
expectations of a year; and a famine but too frequently en&s;ues. In their
native tro|pical climates they are not &s;o dreadful as in the more &s;outhern
parts of Europe. There, though the plain and the fore&s;t be &s;tripped of
their ver|dure, the power of vegetation is &s;o great, that an interval of
three or four days repairs the <PB N="343" REF="352"> calamity: but our verdure
is the livery of a &s;ea&s;on; and we mu&s;t wait till the en&s;uing &s;pring
repairs the damage. Be&s;ides, in their long flights to this part of the world,
they are fa|mi&s;hed by the tediou&s;ne&s;s of their journey, and are therefore
more voracious wherever they happen to &s;ettle. But it is not by what they
devour that they do &s;o much damage as by what they de&s;troy. Their very bite
is thought to contaminate the plant, and to prevent its vegetation. To u&s;e
the expre&s;&s;ion of the hu&s;bandman, they burn whatever they touch; and
leave the marks of their deva&s;tation for two or three years en&s;uing. But if
they be noxious while living, they are &s;till more &s;o when dead; for
wherever they fall, they infect the air in &s;uch a manner that the &s;mell is
in|&s;upportable. Oro&s;ius tells us, that in the year of the world 3800, there
was an incredible number of locu&s;ts which infected Africa; and, after having
eaten up every thing that was green, they flew off and were drowned in the
African &s;ea; where they cau&s;ed &s;uch a &s;tench, that the putrefying
bodies of hundreds of thou&s;ands of men could not equal it.</P>
<P>In the year 1690, a cloud of locu&s;ts was &s;een to enter
Ru&s;&s;ia in three different places; and from thence to &s;pread them&s;elves
over <PB N="344" REF="353"> Poland and Lithuania, in &s;uch a&s;toni&s;hing
mul|titudes, that the air was darkened, and the earth covered with their
numbers. In &s;ome places they were &s;een lying dead, heaped upon each other
four feet deep; in others, they covered the &s;urface like a black cloth: the
trees bent beneath their weight; and the da|mage which the country
&s;u&s;tained exceeded computation. In Barbary their numbers are formidable,
and their vi&s;its are frequent. In the year 1724, Doctor Shaw was a witne&s;s
in that country of their deva&s;tations. Their fir&s;t appearance was about the
latter end of March, when the wind had been &s;outherly for &s;ome time. In the
beginning of April, their numbers were &s;o va&s;tly encrea&s;ed, that in the
heat of the day they formed them&s;elves into large &s;warms, which appeared
like clouds, and darkened the &s;un. In the middle of May they began to
di&s;appear, retiring into the plains to depo&s;it their eggs. In the next
month, being June, the young brood began to make their appear|ance, forming
many compact bodies of &s;everal hundred yards &s;quare; which afterwards
march|ing forward, climbed the trees, walls, and hou&s;es, eating every thing
that was green in their way. The inhabitants, to &s;top their pro|gre&s;s, laid
trenches all over their fields and <PB N="345" REF="354"> gardens, filling them
with water. Some placed large quantities of heath, &s;tubble, and &s;uch like
combu&s;tible matter, in rows, and &s;et them on fire on the approach of the
locu&s;ts. But all this was to no purpo&s;e; for the trenches were quickly
filled up, and the fires put out by the va&s;t number of &s;warms that
&s;ucceeded each other. A day or two after one of the&s;e was in motion, others
that were ju&s;t hatched came to glean after them, gnawing off the young
branches and the very bark of the trees. Having lived near a month in this
manner, they arrived at their full growth, and threw off their worm-like
&s;tate, by ca&s;ting their &s;kins. To prepare them&s;elves for this change,
they fixed their hinder feet to &s;ome bu&s;h or twig, or corner of a &s;tone,
when immediately, by an undulating motion u&s;ed on this occa&s;ion, their
heads would fir&s;t appear, and &s;oon after the re&s;t of their bodies. The
whole transformation was per|formed in &s;even or eight minutes time; after
which, they were a little while in a langui&s;hing condition; but as &s;oon as
the &s;un and air had hardened their wings, and dried up the moi&s;ture that
remained after ca&s;ting off their &s;loughs, they returned again to their
former greedine&s;s, with an addition both of &s;trength and agility. But they
did not continue long in this &s;tate <PB N="346" REF="355"> before they were
entirely di&s;per&s;ed; after laying their eggs, directing their cour&s;e
northward, and probably peri&s;hed in the &s;ea. It is &s;aid that the holes
the&s;e animals make, to depo&s;ite their eggs, are four feet deep in the
ground; where the eggs are depo&s;ited, about four&s;core in number, of the
&s;ize of caraway comfits, and bundled up together in clu&s;ters.</P>
<P>It would be endle&s;s to recount all the mi&s;|chiefs which
the&s;e fami&s;hed in&s;ects have at dif|ferent times occa&s;ioned; but what
can have in|duced them to take &s;uch di&s;tant flights, when they come into
Europe, is not &s;o ea&s;y to be accounted for. It &s;eems mo&s;t probable,
that by means of a very dry &s;ea&s;on in the heart of Africa, they are
propagated in &s;uch numbers, that the vegetables of the &s;pot where they are
produced are not &s;ufficient to &s;u&s;tain them. Thus being obliged to find
out other countries, they traver&s;e the &s;andy de&s;erts, where they can find
no &s;u&s;tenance; &s;till meeting with nothing to allure them from their
height, they proceed forward acro&s;s the &s;ea, and thus come into Eu|rope,
where they alight upon the fir&s;t green pa&s;tures that occur.</P>
<P>In &s;ome parts of the world, the inhabitants turn what
&s;eems a plague to their own advan|tage. Locu&s;ts are eaten by the natives in
many <PB N="347" REF="356"> kingdoms of the ea&s;t; and are caught in &s;mall
nets provided for that purpo&s;e. They parch them over the fire in an earthen
pan; and when their wings and legs are fallen off, they turn reddi&s;h, of the
colour of boiled &s;hrimps. Dampier has eat them thus prepared, and thinks them
a tolerable di&s;h. The natives of Barbary al&s;o eat them fried with &s;alt;
and they are &s;aid to ta&s;te like cray-fi&s;h.</P>
<P>There is a locu&s;t in Tonquin, about the bigne&s;s of the top
of a man's finger, and as long as the fir&s;t joint. It breeds in the earth, in
low grounds; and in the months of January and February, which is the &s;ea&s;on
for taking them, they i&s;&s;ue from the earth in va&s;t &s;warms. At fir&s;t
they can hardly fly, &s;o that they often fall into the rivers in great
numbers: however, the natives in the&s;e months watch the rivers, and take them
up in multitudes in &s;mall nets. They either eat them fre&s;h, broiled on the
coals, or pickle them for keeping. They are con&s;idered as a great delicacy in
that part of the world, as well by the rich as the poor. In the countries where
they are eaten, they are regularly brought to market, and &s;old as larks or
quails in Europe. They mu&s;t have been a common food with the Jews, as
Mo&s;es, in the book of Leviticus, permits them to eat <PB N="348" REF="357">
four different kinds of this animal, which he takes care to &s;pecify. This
di&s;h, however, has not yet made its way into the kitchens of the luxurious in
Europe; and though we may ad|mire the delicacies of the ea&s;t, we are as yet
happily deprived of the powers of imitation.</P>
<P>Of all animals, however, of this noxious tribe, the Great
We&s;t-Indian Locu&s;t, indi|vidually con&s;idered, is the mo&s;t formidable.
It is about the thickne&s;s of the barrel of a goo&s;e-quill, and the body is
divided into nine or ten joints, in the whole about &s;ix or &s;even inches
long. It has two &s;mall eyes, &s;tanding out of the head like tho&s;e of
crabs, and two feelers like long hair. The whole body is &s;tudded with &s;mall
excre&s;cences, which are not much bigger than the points of pins. The &s;hape
is roundi&s;h, and the body dimini&s;hes in circumference to the tail, which is
forked into two horns. Between the&s;e, there is a &s;ort of a &s;heath
containing a &s;mall dangerous &s;ting. If any per&s;on happens to touch this
in&s;ect he is &s;ure to be &s;tung; and is immediately taken with a
&s;hivering and trembling all over the body; which, however, may &s;oon be put
a &s;top to, by rubbing the place that was affected with a little palm oil.</P>
<P>From the locu&s;t we de&s;cend to the cricket, 
<PB N="349" REF="358"> which is a very inoffen&s;ive and pretty animal. Though
there be a &s;pecies of this in&s;ect that lives entirely in the woods and
fields, yet that with which we are be&s;t acquainted is the Hou&s;e-cricket,
who&s;e voice is &s;o well known behind a country fire in a winter's evening.
There is &s;omething &s;o unu&s;ual in hearing a &s;ound while we do not &s;ee
the animal producing it, nor di&s;cover the place from whence it comes, that
among the country people the chirping of the cricket is always held ominous;
and whether it de&s;erts the fire-&s;ide, or pays an unexpected vi&s;it, the
credulous pea&s;antry always find &s;ome|thing to be afraid of. In general,
however, the killing of a cricket is con&s;idered as a mo&s;t unlucky omen; and
though their company is not much de&s;ired, yet no methods mu&s;t be taken to
remove them.</P>
<P>The cricket very much re&s;embles the gra&s;s|hopper in its
&s;hape, its manner of ruminating, its voice, its leaping, and methods of
propa|gation. It differs in its colour, which is uni|formly of a ru&s;ty brown;
in its food, which is more various; and in its place of re&s;idence, which is
mo&s;t u&s;ually in the warme&s;t chinks behind a country hearth. They are, in
&s;ome mea&s;ure, obliged to the bad ma&s;onry employed in making pea&s;ants
hou&s;es for their retreats. <PB N="350" REF="359"> The &s;malle&s;t chink
&s;erves to give them &s;helter; and where they once make their abode they are
&s;ure to propagate. They are of a mo&s;t chilly nature, &s;eldom leaving the
fire-&s;ide; and, if undi&s;turbed, are &s;een to hop from their retreats to
chirrup at the blaze in the chimney. The wood-cricket is the mo&s;t timorous
animal in nature; but the chimney-cricket, being u&s;ed to noi&s;es,
di&s;regards not only tho&s;e, but the appearance of people near it. Whether
the voice of this animal is formed in the &s;ame manner with that of the
gra&s;shopper, by a fine membrane at the ba&s;e of the wings, which is moved by
a mu&s;cle, and which being coiled up, gives a &s;ound like a quail-pipe is not
yet a&s;certained; nor do we well know the u&s;e of this voice, &s;ince
anatomical in&s;pection has not yet been able to di&s;cover the &s;malle&s;t
organs of hearing. Still, however, we can make no doubt of their power of
di&s;tingui&s;hing &s;ounds, though probably not in the &s;ame manner with the
more perfect ranks of nature. Certain it is that I have often heard them call,
and this call was as re|gularly an&s;wered by another, although none but the
males are vocal.</P>
<P>As the cricket lives chiefly in the dark, &s;o its eyes &s;eem
formed for the gloomine&s;s of its abode; and tho&s;e who would &s;urprize it,
have <PB N="351" REF="360"> only to light a candle unexpectedly; by which it is
dazzled, and cannot find the way back to its retreat. It is a very voracious
little animal, and will eat bread, flower, and meat; but it is particularly
fond of &s;ugar. They never drink, but keep for months together at the back of
the chimney, where they could po&s;&s;ibly have had no moi&s;ture. The warmth
of their &s;ituation only &s;erves to encrea&s;e their mirth and loquacity.
Except in the very colde&s;t weather, they never cea&s;e their chirruping, but
continue that little piercing note, which is as plea&s;ing to &s;ome as it is
di&s;agreeable to others. The great Scaliger was particularly delighted with
the chirruping of crickets, and kept &s;everal of them for his amu&s;ement,
en|clo&s;ed in a box, which he placed in a warm &s;ituation. Others, on the
contrary, think there is &s;omething ominous and melancholly in the &s;ound,
and u&s;e every endeavour to bani&s;h this in&s;ect from their hou&s;es.
Ledelius tells us of a woman who was very much incommoded by crickets, and
tried, but in vain, every method of bani&s;hing them from her hou&s;e. She at
la&s;t accidentally &s;ucceeded; for having one day in|vited &s;everal gue&s;ts
to her hou&s;e, where there was a wedding, in order to encrea&s;e the
fe&s;tivity of the entertainment, &s;he procured drums and 
<PB N="352" REF="361"> trumpets to entertain them. The noi&s;e of the&s;e was
&s;o much greater than what the little animals were u&s;ed to, that they
in&s;tantly for|&s;ook their &s;ituation, and were never heard in that
man&s;ion more.</P>
<P>But of all the cricket kind, that which is called the
Mole-Cricket is the mo&s;t extraor|dinary. This animal is the large&s;t of all
the in&s;ects with which we are acquainted in this country, being two inches
and an half in length, and three quarters of an inch in breadth. The colour is
of a du&s;ky brown; and at the extre|mity of the tail there are two hairy
excre&s;cences, re&s;embling in &s;ome &s;en&s;e the tail of a mou&s;e. The
body con&s;i&s;ts of eight&s;caly joints or &s;eparate folds, is brown on the
upper part, and more deeply tinged below. The wings are long, narrow, and
terminate in a &s;harp point, each having a blacki&s;h line running down it:
how|ever, when they are extended, they appear to be much broader than could at
fir&s;t &s;ight be &s;up|po&s;ed. The &s;hield of the brea&s;t is of a firm
texture, of a blacki&s;h colour and hairy. The fore-feet, which are this
animal's principal in|&s;truments of burrowing into the earth, are &s;trong,
webbed, and hairy; it generally, how|ever, runs backward; but it is commonly
under ground, where it burrows even fa&s;ter than a <PB N="353" REF="362">
mole. It is thought al&s;o to be amphibious; and capable of living under water,
as well as under ground.</P>
<P>Of all in&s;ects this is the mo&s;t dete&s;ted by gardeners,
as it chiefly re&s;ides in that ground which lies light, and where it finds
&s;ufficient plenty under the &s;urface. Thus, in a &s;ingle night's time, it
will run along a furrow which has been newly &s;own, and rob it of all its
con|tents. Its legs are formed in &s;uch a manner that it can penetrate the
earth in every di|rection; before, behind, and above it. At night it ventures
from its underground habitation, and, like the cricket, has its chirping call.
When the female is fecundated, &s;he makes a cell of clammy earth, the in&s;ide
of which is large enough to hold two hazle-nuts; and in this &s;he lays her
eggs. The whole ne&s;t is about the &s;ize of a common hen's egg, clo&s;ed up
on every &s;ide, and well defended from the &s;malle&s;t breath of air. The
eggs generally amount to the num|ber of an hundred and fifty, being white, and
about the &s;ize of a carraway comfit. They are thus carefully covered, as well
to defend them from the injuries of the weather, as from the attacks of the
black-beetle; that being it&s;elf an underground inhabitant, would, but for
this precaution, devour or de&s;troy them. To prevent <PB N="354" REF="363">
this, the female mole cricket is often po&s;ted as a centinel near the ne&s;t,
and when the black invader plunges in to &s;eize its prey, the guar|dian
in&s;ect &s;eizes him behind, and in&s;tantly bites him in two.</P>
<P>Nothing can exceed the care and a&s;&s;iduity which the&s;e
animals exhibit in the pre&s;ervation of their young. Wherever the ne&s;t is
placed, there &s;eems to be a fortification, avenues and entrenchments, drawn
round it: there are num|berle&s;s winding ways that lead to it, and a ditch
drawn about it, which few of its in&s;ect enemies are able to pa&s;s. But their
care is not confined to this only; for at the approach of winter they carry
their ne&s;t entirely away, and &s;ink it deeper in the ground, &s;o that the
fro&s;t can have no in|fluence in retarding the young brood from coming to
maturity. As the weather grows milder, they rai&s;e their magazines in
propor|tion; till, at la&s;t, they bring it as near the &s;urface as they can,
to receive the genial in|fluence of the &s;un, without wholly expo&s;ing it to
view: yet, &s;hould the fro&s;t unexpectedly re|turn, they &s;ink it agin as
before.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. Of the Earwig, the Froth In&s;ect, and &s;ome
others belonging to the &s;econd Order of In&s;ects.</HEAD>
<P>WE &s;hould &s;till keep in memory that all in&s;ects of the
&s;econd order, though not pro|duced quite perfect from the egg, yet want very
little of their perfection, and require but a very &s;mall change to arrive at
that &s;tate which fits them for flight and generation. The natural functions
in the&s;e are never &s;u&s;pended: from the in&s;tant they leave the egg, they
continue to eat, to move, to leap, and pur&s;ue their prey: a &s;light change
en&s;ues; a &s;kin that enclo&s;ed a part of their body and limbs, bur&s;ts
behind, like a woman's &s;tays, and gives freedom to a &s;et of wings, with
which the animal expatiates, and flies in pur&s;uit of its mate.</P>
<P>Of all this cla&s;s of in&s;ects, the earwig under|goes the
&s;malle&s;t change. This animal is &s;o common, that it &s;carce needs a
de&s;cription: its &s;wiftne&s;s in the reptile &s;tate is not le&s;s
remark|able than its indefatigable velocity when upon the wing. That it mu&s;t
be very prolific, appears from its numbers; and that it is very harmle&s;s, 
<PB N="356" REF="365"> every one's experience can readily te&s;tify. It is
provided with &s;ix feet, and two feelers: the tail is forked; and with this it
often attempts to de|fend it&s;elf again&s;t every a&s;&s;ailant. But its
at|tempts are only the threats of impotence; they draw down the re&s;entment of
powerful animals, but no way &s;erve to defend it. The deformity of its figure,
and its &s;lender make, have al&s;o &s;ub|jected it to an imputation, which,
though en|tirely founded in prejudice, has more than once procured its
de&s;truction. It is &s;uppo&s;ed, as the name imports, that it often enters
into the ears of people &s;leeping; thus cau&s;ing madne&s;s, from the
intolerable pain, and &s;oon after death it&s;elf. Indeed, the French name,
which &s;ignifies the Ear-piercer, urges the calumny again&s;t this harmle&s;s
in&s;ect, in very plain terms: yet nothing can be more unju&s;t; the ear is
already filled with a &s;ub&s;tance which prevents any in&s;ect from en|tering;
and be&s;ides, it is well lined and defended with membranes, which would keep
out any little animal, even though the ear-wax were away. The&s;e reproaches,
therefore, are entirely groundle&s;s: but it were well if the accu&s;ations
which gardeners bring again&s;t the earwig, were as &s;lightly founded. There
is nothing more certain than that it lives among flowers, and de&s;troys them.
When fruit al&s;o has been <PB N="357" REF="366"> wounded by flies, the earwig
generally comes in for a &s;econd fea&s;t, and &s;ucks tho&s;e juices which
they fir&s;t began to broach. Still, however, this in&s;ect is not &s;o noxious
as it would &s;eem; and &s;eldom is found but where the mi&s;chief has been
originally begun by others. Like all of this cla&s;s, the earwig is hatched
from an egg. As there are various kinds of this animal, &s;o they chu&s;e
different places to breed in: in general, however, they lay their eggs under
the bark of plants, or in the clefts of trees, when beginning to decay. They
proceed from the egg in that reptile &s;tate in which they are mo&s;t commonly
&s;een; and, as they grow larger, the wings bound under the &s;kin begin to
burgeon. It is amazing how very little room four large wings take up before
they are protruded; for no per&s;on could ever conceive &s;uch an expan&s;ion
of natural drapery could be rolled up in &s;o &s;mall a pacquet. The &s;heath
in which they are enveloped, folds and covers them &s;o neatly, that the animal
&s;eems quite de&s;titute of wings<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Swammerdam, p.
114.</BIBL></NOTE>; and even when they are bur&s;t from their confinement, the
animal, by the power of the mu&s;cles and joints which it has in the middle of
its wings, can clo&s;ely fold them into a very narrow compa&s;s. When the
earwig has become a winged in&s;ect, it flies in <PB N="358" REF="367">
pur&s;uit of the female, cea&s;ing to feed, and is wholly employed in the
bu&s;ine&s;s of propagation. It lives, in its winged &s;tate, but a few days;
and having taken care for the continuance of po&s;terity, dries up, and dies,
to all appearance con&s;umptive.</P>
<P>To this order of in&s;ects we may al&s;o refer the Cuckow
Spit, or Froth Worm, that is often found hid in that frothy matter which we
find on the &s;urface of plants. It has an oblong, ob|tu&s;e body; and a large
head, with &s;mall eyes. The external wings, for it has four, are of a du&s;ky
brown colour, marked with two white &s;pots: the head is black. The &s;pume in
which it is found wallowing, is all of its own for|mation, and very much
re&s;embles frothy &s;pittle. It proceeds from the vent of the animal, and
other parts of the body; and if it be wiped away, a new quantity will be
quickly &s;een ejected from the little animal's body. Within this &s;pume it is
&s;een in time to acquire four tu|bercles on its back, wherein the wings are
en|clo&s;ed: the&s;e bur&s;ting from a reptile, it becomes a winged animal; and
thus rendered perfect, it flies to meet its mate, and propagate its kind.</P>
<P>The Water Tipula al&s;o belongs to this cla&s;s. It has an
oblong &s;lender body, with four feet fixed upon the brea&s;t, and four feelers
near the <PB N="359" REF="368"> mouth. It has four weak wings, which do not at
all &s;eem proper for flying, but leaping only. But what this in&s;ect chiefly
demands our at|tention for is, the wonderful lightne&s;s where|with it runs on
the &s;urface of the water, &s;o as &s;carcely to put it in motion. It is
&s;ometimes &s;een in rivers, and on their banks, e&s;pecially under &s;hady
trees; and generally in &s;warms of &s;everal together.</P>
<P>The Common Water-Flie al&s;o breeds in the &s;ame manner with
tho&s;e above-mentioned. This animal is by &s;ome called the Notonecta,
becau&s;e it does not &s;wim, in the u&s;ual manner, upon its belly, but on its
back: nor can we help ad|miring that fitne&s;s in this in&s;ect for its
&s;ituation, as it feeds on the under-&s;ide of plants which grow on the
&s;urface of the water; and therefore it is thus formed with its mouth upwards,
to take its food with greater convenience and ea&s;e.</P>
<P>We may al&s;o add the Water-Scorpion, which is a large
in&s;ect, being near an inch in length, and about half an inch in breadth. Its
body is nearly oval, but very flat and thin; and its tail long and pointed. The
head is &s;mall; and the feelers appear like legs, re&s;embling the claws of a
&s;corpion, but without &s;harp points. This in&s;ect is generally found in
ponds; and is, of all others, the mo&s;t tyrannical and rapacious. 
<PB N="360" REF="369"> It de&s;troys, like a wolf among &s;heep, twenty times
as many as its hunger requires. One of the&s;e, when put into a ba&s;on of
water, in which were thirty or forty worms of the libellula kind, each as large
as it&s;elf, de&s;troyed them all in a few minutes; getting on their backs, and
pierc|ing with its trunk through their body. The&s;e animals, however, though
&s;o formidable to others, are neverthele&s;s them&s;elves greatly overrun with
a little kind of lou&s;e, about the &s;ize of a nit, which very probably repays
the injury which the water-&s;corpion inflicts upon others.</P>
<P>The water-&s;corpions live in the water by day; out of which
they ri&s;e in the du&s;k of the even|ing into the air, and &s;o flying from
place to place, often betake them&s;elves, in que&s;t of food, to other waters.
The in&s;ect, before its wings are grown, remains in the place where it was
produced; but when come to its &s;tate of per|fection, &s;allies forth in
&s;earch of a companion of the other &s;ex, in order to continue its noxious
po&s;terity.</P>

<PB N="361" REF="370">
<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Of the Ephemera.</HEAD>
<P>THE la&s;t in&s;ect we &s;hall add to this &s;econd order, is
the Ephemera; which, though not &s;trictly belonging to it, yet &s;eems more
pro|perly referred to this rank than any other. In|deed, we mu&s;t not attend
to the rigour of method, in an hi&s;tory where Nature &s;eems to take delight
to &s;port in variety.</P>
<P>That there &s;hould be a tribe of flies who&s;e duration
extends but to a day, &s;eems at fir&s;t &s;urprizing; but the wonder will
encrea&s;e, when we are told, that &s;ome of this kind &s;eem to be born and to
die in the &s;pace of a &s;ingle hour. The reptile, however, from which they
are bred, is by no means &s;o &s;hort lived; but is &s;ometimes &s;een to live
two years, and many times three years together.</P>
<P>All ephemeras, of which there are various kinds, are produced
from the egg, in the form of worms; from whence they change into a more perfect
form; namely, that of Aurelias, which is a kind of middle &s;tate between a
worm and a fly: and from thence they take their la&s;t mutation, which is into
a beautiful fly, of <PB N="362" REF="371"> longer or &s;horter duration,
according to its kind.</P>
<P>The ephemera, in its fly &s;tate, is a very beautiful winged
in&s;ect, and has a &s;trong &s;imi|litude to the butterfly, both from its
&s;hape and its wings. It is about the &s;ize of a middling butterfly; but its
wings differ, in not being covered with the painted du&s;t with which tho&s;e
of butterflies are adorned, and rendered opake, for they are very tran&s;parent
and very thin. The&s;e in&s;ects have four wings, the uppermo&s;t of which are
much the large&s;t: when the in&s;ect is at re&s;t, it generally lays its wings
one over the other, on the back. The body is long, being formed of &s;ix rings,
that are larger at the origin than near the extremity; and from this a tail
proceeds, that is longer than all the re&s;t of the fly, and con&s;i&s;ts
&s;ometimes of three threads of an equal length, or &s;ometimes of two long and
one &s;hort. To acquire this beautiful form, the in&s;ect has been obliged to
undergo &s;everal tran&s;mutations: but its glory is very &s;hort lived, for
the hour of its perfection is the hour of its death; and it &s;eems &s;carcely
intro|duced to plea&s;ure, when it is obliged to part with life.</P>
<P>The reptile that is to become a fly, and that is granted &s;o
long a term, when compared to its <PB N="363" REF="372"> latter duration, is an
inhabitant of the water, and bears a very &s;trong re&s;emblance to fi&s;hes,
in many particulars; having gills by which it breathes at the bottom, and
al&s;o the tapering form of aquatic animals. The&s;e in&s;ects have &s;ix
&s;caly legs, fixed on their cor&s;elet. Their head is triangular: the eyes are
placed forward, and may be di&s;tingui&s;hed by their largene&s;s and colour.
The mouth is furni&s;hed with teeth; and the body con&s;i&s;ts of &s;ix rings;
that next the cor&s;elet being large&s;t, but growing le&s;s and le&s;s to the
end: the la&s;t ring is the &s;horte&s;t, from which the three threads proceed,
which are as long as the whole body. Thus we &s;ee that the reptile bears a
very &s;trong re&s;emblance to the fly; and only requires wings, to be very
near its perfection.</P>
<P>As there are &s;everal kinds of this animal, their aurelias
are con&s;equently of different colours; &s;ome yellow, &s;ome brown, and
&s;ome cream-coloured. Some of the&s;e al&s;o bore them|&s;elves cells at the
bottom of the water, from which they never &s;tir out, but feed upon the mud
compo&s;ing the walls of their habitation, in contented captivity; others, on
the contrary, range about, go from the bottom to the &s;urface, &s;wim between
two waters, quit that element entirely to feed upon plants by the river &s;ide,
<PB N="364" REF="373"> and then return to their favourite element, for &s;afety
and protection.</P>
<P>The reptile, however, though it lives two or three years,
offers but little, in its long du|ration, to excite curio&s;ity: it is hid at
the bot|tom of the water, and feeds almo&s;t wholly within its narrow
habitation. The mo&s;t &s;triking facts command our attention during the
&s;hort interval of its fly &s;tate; into which it crouds the mo&s;t various
tran&s;actions of its little life. It then may be &s;aid to be in a hurry to
live, as it has but &s;o &s;mall a time to exi&s;t. The peculiar &s;ign whereby
to know that the&s;e reptiles will change into flies in a &s;hort time,
con&s;i&s;ts in a protuberance of the wings on the back. About that time the
&s;mooth and depre&s;&s;ed form of the upper part of the body, is changed into
a more &s;wolen and rounder &s;hape; &s;o that the wings are in &s;ome degree
vi&s;ible through the external &s;heath that covers them. As they are not
na|tives of England, he who would &s;ee them in their greate&s;t abundance,
mu&s;t walk, about &s;un-&s;et, along the banks of the Rhine, or the Seine,
near Paris; where, for about three days, in the mid&s;t of the &s;ummer, he
will be a&s;toni&s;hed at their numbers and a&s;&s;iduity. The thicke&s;t
de&s;cent of the flakes of &s;now in winter &s;eem not to equal their number;
the whole air &s;eems alive <PB N="365" REF="374"> with the new-born race; and
the earth it&s;elf is all over covered with their remains. The au|relias, or
reptile in&s;ects, that are as yet beneath the &s;urface of the water, wait
only for the ap|proach of evening to begin their transformation. The mo&s;t
indu&s;trious &s;hake off their old gar|ments about eight o'clock; and tho&s;e
who are the mo&s;t tardy, are transformed before nine.</P>
<P>We have already &s;een that the operation of change in other
in&s;ects is laborious and painful; but with the&s;e nothing &s;eems &s;horter,
or per|formed with greater ea&s;e. The aurelias are &s;carce lifted above the
&s;urface of the water, than their old &s;heathing &s;kin bur&s;ts; and through
the cavity which is thus formed, a fly i&s;&s;ues, who&s;e wings, at the &s;ame
in&s;tant, are unfolded, and at the &s;ame time lift it into the air. Millions
and millions of aurelias, ri&s;e in this manner to the &s;urface; and at once
become flies, and fill every quarter with their flutterings. But all the&s;e
&s;ports are &s;hortly to have an end; for as the little &s;trangers live but
an hour or two, the whole &s;warm &s;oon falls to the ground, and covers the
earth, like a deep &s;now, for &s;everal hundred yards, on every &s;ide of the
river. Their num|bers are then incredible, and every object they touch becomes
fatal to them; for they in&s;tantly die, if they hit again&s;t even each
other.</P>
<P><PB N="366" REF="375">At this time the males and females are
very differently employed. The males, quite inactive and apparently without
de&s;ires, &s;eem only born to die: no way like the males of other in&s;ects;
they neither follow the oppo&s;ite &s;ex, nor bear any enmity to each other:
after fluttering for an hour or two, they drop upon land, without &s;eeming to
receive wings for &s;carce any other purpo&s;e but to &s;atisfy an idle
curio&s;ity. It is otherwi&s;e with the females; that are &s;carce ri&s;en from
the &s;urface of the water, and have dried their wings, but they ha&s;ten to
drop their eggs back again. If they happen al&s;o to flutter upon land, they
depo&s;it their burthen in the place where they drop. But then it may be
demanded, where and in what manner are the&s;e eggs fecun|dated, as no
copulation whatever appears be|tween the &s;exes, in their tran&s;itory
vi&s;its in air? Swammerdam is of opinion, that they are im|pregnated in the
manner of fi&s;h-&s;pawn, by the male, after being ejected by the female: but,
be&s;ide that this doctrine is exploded even from the hi&s;tory of fi&s;hes, it
is certain, that the males have not time for this operation, as the eggs drop
to the bottom the in&s;tant they are laid on the water. Reaumur is of opinion
that they copulate; but that the act bears a proportion in &s;hortne&s;s to the
&s;mall duration of their lives; <PB N="367" REF="376"> and, con&s;equently,
mu&s;t be &s;o &s;oon performed, as to be &s;carcely vi&s;ible. This, however,
is at be&s;t forcing a theory; and, it is probable, that as there are many
in&s;ects known to breed with|out any impregnation from the male, as we have
already &s;een in mu&s;cles and the oy&s;ters, and &s;hall hereafter &s;ee in
the gnat, and a &s;pecies of the beetle, &s;o the ephemera may be of this
number. Be this as it may, the females are in &s;uch ha&s;te to depo&s;ite
their eggs, that multitudes of them fall to the ground; but the greate&s;t part
are laid in the water. As they flutter upon the &s;urface, two clu&s;ters are
&s;een i&s;&s;uing from the extremity of their body, each containing about
three hundred and fifty eggs, which make &s;even hundred in all. Thus, of all
in&s;ects, this appears to be the mo&s;t prolific; and it would &s;eem that
there was a nece&s;&s;ity for &s;uch a &s;upply, as, in its reptile &s;tate, it
is the favourite food of every kind of fre&s;h-water fi&s;h. It is in vain that
the&s;e little animals form galleries at the bottom of the river, from whence
they &s;eldom remove; many kinds of fi&s;h break in upon their retreats, and
thin their numbers. For this rea&s;on fi&s;hermen are careful to provide
them&s;elves with the&s;e in&s;ects, as the mo&s;t grate|ful bait; and thus
turn the fi&s;h's rapacity to its own de&s;truction.</P>
<P><PB N="368" REF="377">But though the u&s;ual date of tho&s;e
flies is two or three hours at farthe&s;t, there are &s;ome kinds that live
&s;everal days; and one kind in particular, after quitting the water, has
another ca&s;e or &s;kin to get rid of. The&s;e are often &s;een in the fields
and woods, di&s;tant from the water; but they are more frequently found in its
vici|nity. They are often found &s;ticking upon walls and trees; and frequently
with the head down|wards, without changing place, or having any &s;en&s;ible
motion. They are then waiting for the moment when they &s;hall be dive&s;ted of
their la&s;t incommodious garment, which &s;ometimes does not happen for two or
three days together.</P>
