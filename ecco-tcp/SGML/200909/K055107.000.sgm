<HEAD>TO SAMUEL FOOTE, E&s;q.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THO', had this comedy failed, which, from it's fir&s;t night's reception, was &s;ome|what more than probable, I &s;hould cer|tainly have &s;uffered the whole di&s;grace, it is not with le&s;s readine&s;s, that I &s;eize this opportunity, on its better &s;ucce&s;s, to acknowledge the obligations which the editor of DOCTOR LAST IN HIS CHARIOT has to Mr. FOOTE.</P>
<P>I am indebted to you for undertaking a very long part; which, in your circum&s;tan|ces, I con&s;ider as a particular favour: I am indebted to you, for exerting unu&s;ual &s;pi|rit in the performance, when there was little hopes of putting the audience in a good humour; and more, (don't be a|&s;hamed when I boa&s;t of it) I am indebted to you, not only for a whole &s;cene, the con&s;ultation of phy&s;icians in the fir&s;t act, but for &s;everal hints throughout the piece, which had the happie&s;t effect, tho' &s;ome of them may, perhaps, have &s;uffered by being cloathed in my language.</P>
<P>I am more particularly acknowledging upon this occa&s;ion, becau&s;e, in the repeated remarks which the news-papers have
<PB N="iv" REF="3"> thought proper to make on your addre&s;s to the public, the fir&s;t night this thing was acted, they would in&s;inuate, that you u&s;ed the advantage your &s;ituation gave you, of a per&s;onal application to the audience, in order to throw contempt upon the piece while that and it's author were immedi|ately under your protection.</P>
<P>However, Sir, while I return you tho&s;e thanks which, ju&s;tice and gratitude oblige me to; I am extremely doubtful whether the public will con&s;ider the favours I con|fe&s;s, as any capital exertion of benevo|lence on your part; for they will naturally &s;ay, that, as to your acting, the play could not po&s;&s;ibly have done without it, which, after you had received it, mu&s;t have been to your lo&s;s; and, for giving me your wit and humour, all the world is &s;en&s;ible, that there is &s;carcely a man living who has &s;o much to &s;pare. I am,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following piece is a tran&s;lation of Le MALADE IMAGINAIRE, one of MOLIERE's mo&s;t celebrated productions in the farcical kind. Some &s;cenes which could not po&s;&s;ibly &s;ucceed upon the Engli&s;h &s;tage, have been removed, and tho&s;e &s;ub&s;tituted, in which the character of DOCTOR LAST is introduced; and, for that character only, the editor has to an&s;wer; no|thing el&s;e in the &s;ub&s;equent &s;cenes, being intirely his.</P>
<P>How it has hitherto appeared upon the &s;tage, or how it may appear hereafter, is at pre&s;ent of little con&s;equence. It is &s;ubmitted to the can|dour of intelligent readers, who will con&s;ider a farce as &s;uch, and decide upon it's merit ac|cordingly. To add more is needle&s;s, except thanks to the performers, particularly to Mr. Sowdon, for his kindne&s;s to the editor, when he &s;tood in great need of a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and to that admirable comedian, Mr. We&s;ton, by who&s;e excellent performance, Dr. La&s;t is &s;till render'd a laughable object.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Written by D. GARRICK, E&s;q. and &s;poken by Mr. FOOTE.</BYLINE>
<L>YOUR &s;ervants, kind ma&s;ters, from bottom to top.</L>
<L>Be a&s;&s;ur'd, while I breath, or can walk&mdash;I mean hop,</L>
<L>Be you plea&s;ed to &s;mile, or be plea&s;ed to grumble,</L>
<L>Be whatever you plea&s;e, I am &s;till your mo&s;t humble.</L>
<L>As to laugh is a right only given to man,</L>
<L>To keep up that right is my pride and my plan&mdash;</L>
<L>Fair ladies, don't frown, I meant woman too&mdash;</L>
<L>What's common to man, mu&s;t be common to you.&mdash;</L>
<L>You all have a right your &s;weet mu&s;cles to curl,</L>
<L>From the old &s;mirking prude, to the titt'ring young girl;</L>
<L>And ever with plea&s;ure my brains I could &s;pin,</L>
<L>To make you all giggle, and you, ye gods, grin.</L>
<L>In this pre&s;ent &s;ummer, as well as the pa&s;t,</L>
<L>To your favour again we pre&s;ent Dr. La&s;t,</L>
<L>Who, by wonderful feats, in the papers recounted,</L>
<L>From trudging on foot, to his chariot has mounted.</L>
<L>Among&s;t the old Britons, when war was begun,</L>
<L>Charioteers would &s;lay ten, while the foot could &s;lay one:</L>
<L>So, when doctors on wheels with di&s;patches are &s;ent,</L>
<L>Mortality bills ri&s;e a thou&s;and per cent.</L>
<L>But think not to phy&s;ic that quack'ry's confin'd,</L>
<L>All the world is a &s;tage, and the quacks are mankind&mdash;</L>
<L>There's trade, law, and &s;tate-quacks; nay, would we but &s;earch,</L>
<L>We &s;hould find&mdash;Heaven ble&s;s us!&mdash;&s;ome quacks in the church!</L>
<L>The &s;tiff band, and &s;tiff bob of the methodi&s;t race,</L>
<L>Give the bal&s;am of life and the tincture of grace,</L>
<L>And their poor wretched patients think much good is done 'em,</L>
<L>Tho' bli&s;ters and cau&s;ticks are ever upon them.</L>
<L>As for law and the &s;tate, if quack'ry's a cur&s;e,</L>
<L>Which will make the good bad, and the bad will make wor&s;e,</L>
<L><PB REF="6">We &s;hould point out the quack, from the regular brother,</L>
<L>They are wi&s;er than I who can tell one from t'other!</L>
<L>Can the &s;tage with its bills, puffs, and patents, &s;tand trial,</L>
<L>Shall we find out no quacks in the Theatre Royal?</L>
<L>Some dramatical drugs that are puff'd on the town,</L>
<L>Cau&s;e many wry faces, and &s;carce will <HI>go down.</HI></L>
<L>Nay, an audience &s;ometimes will in quack'ry delight,</L>
<L>And &s;weat down an author &s;ome pounds in one night.</L>
<L>To return to our quack&mdash;&s;hould he, help'd by the weather,</L>
<L>Rai&s;e laughter and kind per&s;piration together,</L>
<L>Should his no&s;trums of hips and of vapours but cure ye,</L>
<L>His chariot he well will de&s;erve, I a&s;&s;ure ye.</L>
<L>'Tis ea&s;y to &s;et up a chariot in town,</L>
<L>And ea&s;ier &s;till is that chariot laid down.</L>
<L>He petitions by me, both as doctor and lover,</L>
<L>That you'll not &s;top his wheels, or his chariot tip over:</L>
<L>Fix him well, I be&s;eech you, the wor&s;t on't would be,</L>
<L>Should you overturn <HI>him,</HI> you may <HI>over&s;et me.</HI></L>

<P>Sneezing, Dr. Bulruddery, was a mor|tal &s;ymptom that attended a pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;e, which formerly depopulated the republic of Athens; ever &s;ince, when that convul&s;ion oc|curs, a &s;hort ejaculation is offered up, that the &s;neezing or &s;ternuting party, may not be afflicted with the &s;ame di&s;temper.</P>

<P>True; why, there was ye&s;terday, the fir&s;t pul&s;e I felt belonged to a lad with the mea&s;les, in Dean's-yard, We&s;tmin&s;ter: from thence I &s;et out between &s;even and eight, my wig fre&s;h powdered, and my hor&s;es in &s;pirits; I turned at Charing Cro&s;s for the New Buildings; then run through the Holbourn divi&s;ion, cro&s;&s;ed the Fleet-market, and penetrated into the city as far as Whitechapel; then, made a &s;hort trip to the wife of a &s;ale&s;man, who had the gout in her &s;tomach, at Wapping; from thence, re|turned through Cornhill, Temple-Bar, and the Strand, and fini&s;hed my la&s;t pre&s;cription, be|tween five and &s;ix, for a trade&s;man in Cock|&s;pur-&s;treet, who had bur&s;t a vein in hallooing at the Brentford election.</P>

<P>If you mean to us of the college, Dr. Bulruddery, little or nothing: if, indeed, there &s;hould happen to be warm work at the hu&s;t|ings, the corporation of &s;urgeons may pick up &s;ome practice, tho' I don't look upon any of the&s;e public tran&s;actions as of any great u&s;e to our body, in general.

<STAGE>Spoken by a LITTLE GIRL of Five Years old.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>LADIES and gentlemen, they've &s;ent me out&mdash;</L>
<L>But I'm afraid to tell you what about;</L>
<L>Becau&s;e 'twere bold in me, perhaps you'll &s;ay,</L>
<L>To come to a&s;k you how you like the play:</L>
<L>Yet that's my bu&s;ine&s;s; nay, more free to make,</L>
<L>I'm come to beg you'd like it for my &s;ake.</L>
<L>The author took me in his arms ju&s;t now,</L>
<L>My dear, &s;ays he&mdash;he ki&s;s'd me too I vow&mdash;</L>
<L>If you'll go out and make the audience clap,</L>
<L>I'll give you ribbons and a fine new cap:</L>
<L>Be&s;ides, he promis'd me, next time he comes</L>
<L>Behind the &s;cenes, to bring me &s;ugar-plumbs.</L>
<L>But what&s;oe'er you think the play to be,</L>
<L>When you go home I'm &s;ure you'll talk of me.</L>

<L>Says Lady Stingo to Sir Gilbert mild,</L>
<L>"At FOOTE's, Sir Gilbert, have you &s;een the child!</L>
<L>"'Tis really a <HI>curo&s;ity</HI> to view her:</L>

<L>"Such action, &s;uch a tongue&mdash;and yet I query</L>
<L>"If &s;he be five years old&mdash;a very fairy!"</L>
<L>Sir Gilbert an&s;wers, with a pevi&s;h nod,</L>
<L>"P'&s;haw! let the little hu&s;&s;y have a rod.</L>
<L>"There are old folks enough to play the fool:</L>
<L>"Children, my lady, &s;hou'd be &s;ent to &s;chool."</L>
<L>And &s;o they &s;hould, the naughty ones, no doubt,</L>
<L>Who'll neither books nor needle learn without:</L>
<L>But I am come of no &s;uch idle breed;</L>
<L>At four years old, I could both write and read;</L>
