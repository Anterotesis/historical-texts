<HEAD>POLITICAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE TEST ACT, M.DCC.XC.</HEAD>
<P>THE purpo&s;e of this tract is to &s;how the utility of a Te&s;t Act upon political principles; and to examine &s;uch arguments which have been brought again&s;t it upon the&s;e grounds, as &s;eem more particularly to de&s;erve con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Its nature and utility may be proved, by &s;howing</P>
<P>Fir&s;tly. That the te&s;t act is a part of the Con&s;titution, and that in the higher and &s;tricter &s;en&s;e of the term, and con&s;equently, that the Repeal of it will be a material change in the Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Secondly. That it appears from &s;uch in&s;tances of hi&s;tory as are properly applicable to this &s;ubject, that when two Religions are &s;uffered to exi&s;t in a free &s;tate; it is expedient that the &s;tronger of the two &s;hould have the exclu&s;ive po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the executive powers of the government.</P>
<P>Thirdly. That the repeal of the te&s;t act would increa&s;e the power of the popular part of the con&s;titution, be&s;ide producing &s;ome other bad effects; and therefore, that its continuance is nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve it in its pre&s;ent &s;tate.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">Fourthly. What is to be laid down on the&s;e heads, will be concluded with &s;ome &s;trictures on &s;uch political arguments brought in favour of the repeal, as &s;eem to be mo&s;t intitled to con&s;ideration.</P>
<P N="1">I. THE te&s;t act is fir&s;t to be &s;hown to be a part of the Con&s;titution in the higher and &s;tricter &s;en&s;e of the term, from the nature of a Con&s;titution con&s;idered in the ab&s;tract; and in addition to this, the con&s;equences of its original in&s;titution, and the benefits attending its &s;ub&s;equent exten&s;ion, will be pointed out.</P>
<P>Every Nation, not under a de&s;potic Sovereign, is governed by written or by traditional laws called cu&s;toms. The laws are divi&s;ible into two cla&s;&s;es: the fir&s;t of which relates to the governors, and the &s;econd to the &s;ubject: tho&s;e relating to &s;ubjects are moral and po&s;itive, tho&s;e relating to the governors are called Con&s;titutional. The laws therefore which pre&s;cribe fir&s;t who &s;hall govern, and &s;econdly in what mode, are con&s;ti|tutional in the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e of the term; or fundamental laws of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The functions of every government not de&s;potic, are divided into two great branches, the legi&s;lative and the executive: and it is determined by the fundamental principles of the con&s;titution, to whom the exerci&s;e of both or either, &s;hall be intru&s;ted. And a change of the&s;e laws is a change of the fun|damentals of its con&s;titution. As for example, tho&s;e which determine how the executive power &s;hall be formed; which laws by their nature, mu&s;t direct the mode of inve&s;ting parti|cular per&s;ons with that power; and define the qualifications of the per&s;ons, capable of being &s;o inve&s;ted. And to contract or extend this de&s;cription, is to make a change in the funda|mental parts of the con&s;titution. The&s;e laws, in England, confide the whole of the executive powers of the &s;tate to the Members of the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church: and the admi&s;&s;ion of
<PB N="5" REF="4">
prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters to a &s;hare in this power, is a change of the de&s;cription given above, and an alteration of one of the fundamental parts of the con&s;titution. Therefore the Repeal of the te&s;t act would be a fundamental Change in the Con|&s;titution.</P>
<P>The benefits of the initial operation of this act, and tho&s;e accompanying its &s;ucce&s;&s;ive exten&s;ions, intitle it likewi&s;e to be con&s;idered as con&s;titutional; or as an e&s;&s;ential part of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>At its fir&s;t in&s;titution, it gave protection to the liberties and religion of the kingdom, again&s;t the violent mea&s;ures of James the II. but it &s;eems at fir&s;t not to have gone far enough; it was therefore extended by the parliamentary Convention at the Revolution; who <Q>in the &s;ettlement of the crown, included all the <HI>prote&s;tant</HI> po&s;terity of Charles I. except &s;uch other i&s;&s;ue as King James might at any time have,</Q> (Black&s;tone, b. 1, c. 3,) be&s;ide the prince&s;&s;es of Orange and Denmark. This limitation of the de&s;cent of the Crown to the prote&s;tant po&s;terity of Charles I. was an exten&s;ion of the principle of the te&s;t act, pre&s;cribing the Religion of the chief magi&s;trate: and the declaration in which it was contained, by placing William upon the throne, gave &s;tability to tho&s;e rights and liberties of the people, then, perhaps for the fir&s;t time, clearly defined by laws.</P>
<P>Upon the pro&s;pect of the failure of the prote&s;tant de&s;cen|dants of Charles I. tho&s;e of James I. were called to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and it was enacted, that upon the death of William and Anne without i&s;&s;ue, the prince&s;s Sophia, or the heirs of her body, (being prote&s;tants) &s;hould &s;ucceed to the throne: (Black&s;tone, b. 1, c, 3.) At the &s;ame time, the principle of the te&s;t act was carried to its utmo&s;t extent; it being enacted, that whoever afterward &s;hould come to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the crown, &s;hould join in the communion of the Church of England as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed. By this law, the happy con&s;e|quences of the Revolution were perpetuated.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="5">But I &s;hall add a further ob&s;ervation, on the nature and con&s;equences of te&s;t acts in general. Much more of the ani|mo&s;ity and &s;everity of religious parties again&s;t each other, proceeds from mutual fear, than the de&s;ire of mutual oppo|&s;ition: hence the mo&s;t numerous religious party, with the whole executive power in its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, has little to fear, and becomes tolerating. But if it only &s;hares that power with its opponents, its anxiety for its own &s;afety and dread of their enterpri&s;es, embitters its &s;pirit again&s;t them; and the idea of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, makes it wi&s;h to reduce or to annihilate this oppo&s;ition. A great e&s;tabli&s;hed church, fortified by a te&s;t act,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Since the re&s;toration there have been pa&s;&s;ed four Acts, either in the whole or in part te&s;t Acts.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Corporation act.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Te&s;t act properly &s;o called.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The Conventional act, or declaration of the Lords and Commons at the revolution, excluding Catholics from the throne.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The Act of Settlement, limiting the crown to members of the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed church.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>All but the third continue in force, and the principle of the fir&s;t and fourth is the &s;ame as that of the third, or te&s;t act properly &s;o called. There|fore, as what is &s;aid of that act applies to them all, and as it avoids circum|locutions and unu&s;ual expre&s;&s;ions, the term Te&s;t Act is generally u&s;ed alone.</P></NOTE> as a legal barrier, confident of its own &s;trength and &s;afety, can extend a legal toleration to all &s;ectaries: and it is highly probable, if the te&s;t and corporation acts had not exi&s;ted; that the toleration act and its &s;ub&s;equent improvements, would not now have occupied a page in our &s;tatute books; nor the &s;ucce&s;sful example of this kingdom, taught Europe in general, that the rigour of religious per&s;ecution might be with &s;afety remitted. Such appear to have been the ultimate con&s;e|quences of the&s;e laws, who&s;e fir&s;t effects clapped manacles upon the hand of a tyrant, rai&s;ed to &s;ubvert the civil and reli|gious liberties of his country: who&s;e fir&s;t exten&s;ion delivered
<PB N="7" REF="6">
the &s;tate from anarchy; and removed to a di&s;tance the return of the evils we had ju&s;t e&s;caped: and who&s;e principles, when carried to their ultimate perfection, perpetuated tho&s;e liber|ties and that excellent &s;y&s;tem of government, which co&s;t our ance&s;tors nearly a century of di&s;cord, civil wars, and revo|lutions to acquire. From its effects therefore, it appears that the principle of a te&s;t act is con&s;titutional.</P>
<P>Part 2. Although it be admitted that the con&s;titution of this kingdom has been varied at different times; many of which variations have been improvements: yet the experi|ment of one hundred years, of freedom, pro&s;perity, and com|parative dome&s;tic quiet, renders it ab&s;olutely incumbent upon the advocates for the repeal of the te&s;t act, to give the cleare&s;t evidence of the advantages to the &s;tate which would follow it.</P>
<P>In matters of &s;uch general intere&s;t, the arguments drawn from experience, are ju&s;tly to be e&s;teemed as the mo&s;t deci&s;ive; and the hi&s;tories of different nations are to be regarded as regi&s;ters of experiments; from which the great maxims of policy, on &s;uch occa&s;ions, are be&s;t deduced. This mode of rea&s;oning in political inquiries, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the &s;ame advantages over all others, which attends the method of experiment and induction in philo&s;ophy: which has enabled it, in little more than a century, to make a much greater progre&s;s than in all the ages antecedently elap&s;ed. And it is from its con&s;tant application alone, that the &s;cience of legi&s;lation and govern|ment, can receive that ultimate perfection of which it is capable. Accordingly, the examples of many modern &s;tates have been alledged to &s;how, that no ill con&s;equence in fact re&s;ults to &s;ociety, from intru&s;ting the executive powers of goverment, indi&s;criminately, to the different religious &s;ects it may at any one time contain.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e examples, &s;uch as are applicable, clearly point out a nece&s;&s;ity that the &s;tate &s;hould e&s;tabli&s;h the religion of the
<PB N="8" REF="7">
majority, as a national Church, and confide the executive power exclu&s;ively to its members: which is the &s;econd point propo&s;ed to be &s;hown.</P>
<P>Here it will be of u&s;e to lay down &s;ome marks, to di&s;cri|minate tho&s;e hi&s;torical examples which are applicable to the &s;ubject, from tho&s;e of the oppo&s;ite de&s;cription.</P>
<P>No conclu&s;ions can be drawn again&s;t the expediency of a te&s;t act, from the hi&s;tory of a nation divided into two religious parties, in which the government is arbitrary. De&s;potic power is always at hand to repre&s;s the turbulence of either; and the efforts of each &s;ect to di&s;turb the tranquillity of the &s;tate, are debilitated by the external force which depre&s;&s;es both. Nor do the tran&s;actions of tho&s;e countries, which are much below the re&s;t of Europe in civilization and improve|ment of every kind, furni&s;h in&s;tances which can be properly made u&s;e of, on either &s;ide of the que&s;tion. Tho&s;e nations are likewi&s;e to be excluded, which do not po&s;&s;e&s;s both the exe|cutive and legi&s;lative power within their own limits: for &s;uch a nation differs very much in its political &s;ituation from a Soverign &s;tate; and a te&s;t act may operate very differently therein. Tho&s;e &s;tates therefore who&s;e hi&s;tories are applicable to the &s;ubject mu&s;t be free, &s;overeign, and enlightened. I &s;hall therefore begin with the examination of the hi&s;tory of tho&s;e independent Nations which derive their origin from this I&s;land.</P>
<P>It is a&s;&s;erted by the advocates of the repeal of the te&s;t act, that the &s;tates where no &s;uch law takes place, are not expo&s;ed to frequent revolutiens of government by the conte&s;ts of reli|gious parties: and the united States of America, who have not adopted a te&s;t law, are alleged by them as an example, that there is no nece&s;&s;ity for the impo&s;ition of religious te&s;ts.</P>
<P>To this it may be an&s;wered, that the in&s;tance is inappli|cable, though not coming under the general de&s;criptions given above, becau&s;e no rea&s;on for or again&s;t &s;uch a law, can be
<PB N="9" REF="8">
brought from the hi&s;tory of a &s;tate, during any period in which it has been &s;ubject to revolutions, the cau&s;es of which were not religious di&s;putes. For the advocates for the repeal cannot &s;ay that the con&s;titution of &s;uch a &s;tate remained unchanged, although the religion of the majority was not e&s;tabli&s;hed and guarded by a te&s;t: nor can it be &s;aid in favour of &s;uch a law, that the&s;e revolutions were occa&s;ioned by the want of it. It can only be &s;aid, that religious di&s;putes may &s;leep, during the time that other great objects take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the attention of every &s;ect. That the American States have neither an e&s;tabli&s;hed church nor a te&s;t act, is a circum|&s;tance which &s;eems therefore to give little &s;upport to the arguments on either &s;ide: when they emancipated them&s;elves from this country, they erected a new con&s;titution: upon a &s;hort experience it was found not to be a good one; and they &s;et about forming a &s;econd, very &s;oon after the conclu&s;ion of the peace; which is not yet perfectly &s;ettled. The period of their hi&s;tory, which has been &s;uppo&s;ed to be applicable to the &s;ubject, mu&s;t certainly commence at the period when they became effectively an independent nation; and a great part of it has been taken up by the changes in their con&s;titution. And if it had been otherwi&s;e, it has not extended to a length, in which it might be expected that the &s;pirit of religious di&s;&s;ention would have ari&s;en to that height, which produces great effects.</P>
<P>In the earlier periods of their &s;ubordination to Great Britain, her power was requi&s;ite to keep the different &s;ects from per&s;e|cuting each other; and as different religious opinions were embraced by different colonies, the bittere&s;t animo&s;ities &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted between them: which were kept from breaking out into action, by the &s;ame power. This &s;pirit, though thus re|&s;trained, was not annihilated during that whole period; and it was not the lea&s;t &s;ingular event of the beginning of the la&s;t war, that the terror of foreign arms, and a foreign enemy in
<PB N="10" REF="9">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t important po&s;t of their country, was able to induce them to a peace.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e of Ireland is brought forward by the mo&s;t eloquent of the parliamentary advocates of the repeal; who&s;e argu|ments hold forth profe&s;&s;ions of the &s;tronge&s;t attachment to our civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical con&s;titution, as a conclu&s;ive argument in its favour. It is therefore nece&s;&s;ary to take an hi&s;torical review of the tran&s;actions of that kingdom in regard to the te&s;t act, its church e&s;tabli&s;hment, and civil con&s;titution, from the la&s;t rebellion in Scotland to the pre&s;ent time.</P>
<P>With the penalties of the te&s;t act hanging over their heads, the di&s;&s;enters in Ireland at that time took up arms, to be in readine&s;s to a&s;&s;i&s;t in repre&s;&s;ing any in&s;urrection which might be attempted there. This mea&s;ure the &s;uperiority of &s;trength of the Catholic party in that kingdom rendered as nece&s;&s;ary as patriotical; for a great part of their e&s;tates con&s;i&s;ted of lands which had been forfeited by the ance&s;tors of tho&s;e Catholics,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Four-fifths of the inhabitants of Ireland are Catholic. Young's Iri&s;h tour, v. 2, p. 140. Nineteen-twentieths of the kingdom have changed hands from Catholic to Prote&s;tant. Ib. p. 133. The ejected Catholics continue to tran&s;mit the memorials of their former rights by te&s;tamentary deeds to this day, Ib. p. 133.</P></NOTE> for their repeated rebellions: and it might be very well expected that they would embrace the favourable opportunity of a formidable rebellion exi&s;ting in Great Bri|tain, then engaged in an un&s;ucce&s;sful foreign war, to take arms to regain the free exerci&s;e of their religion, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the lands of their ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>When this danger was happily overcome, it was voted, <Q>that any per&s;on whatever, who &s;hould bring an action again&s;t a di&s;&s;enter under the te&s;t act, &s;hould be deemed an enemy to this country and a Jacobite.</Q> As this does not run in the technical language of legi&s;lation, it is mo&s;t probable
<PB N="11" REF="10">
that it was what it is called above, a vote of one or both hou&s;es: it is &s;aid however, in the public paper from which it is copied, to have been &s;o "enacted," or pa&s;&s;ed into a law: but this, the bare in&s;pection of the matter it contains, proves to be impo&s;&s;ible; it admits the te&s;t act &s;till to have legal exi&s;tence, but fulminates the &s;evere&s;t cen&s;ures again&s;t tho&s;e who &s;hould put it in force; generally; that is, at that time, or any future period. It includes therefore a tacit con|fe&s;&s;ion, that it is not an act of the whole legi&s;lature; who&s;e declarations run, <Q>we grant indemnity for the pa&s;t, and we repeal for the future.</Q> It therefore was a vote, and not part of a law. And the rea&s;on of its appearing in this &s;hape was, that if reduced into a law, the parties thought it mu&s;t be negatived in England; but that in its pre&s;ent &s;hape, it would be full as effective.</P>
<P>It appears to have been nece&s;&s;ary to &s;how, that after this declaration again&s;t the principles of the te&s;t act, the Iri&s;h parliament, in no &s;ub&s;equent point of time, had attacked the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the church of Ireland; of which, the revenues appointed for the &s;upport of the clergy form a material part. But the contrary is true.</P>
<P>It is very well known, that a great part of the tithes of that kingdom, ari&s;e from Kine, and grazing Bea&s;ts; Iri&s;h Beef, and Butter, being among its &s;taple commodities. Mr. A. Young's tour in Ireland was publi&s;hed in 1780; he began it in the year 1776: and he informs us, that the Iri&s;h hou&s;e of Com|mons, &s;ome years previous to his writing, pa&s;&s;ed a vote, <Q>declaring every lawyer an enemy to his country, who in any way whatever, was concerned in any ca&s;e of tithe for fat bullocks and cows.</Q> <Q>And that without this becoming a law, it was &s;o completely obeyed, that it has regulated the bu&s;ine&s;s ever &s;ince.</Q> (v. 2, p. 186, 187.) The effect of that regulation appears in the preceding page, where he gives the average value of the tithe, of all the greater arti|cles
<PB N="12" REF="11">
produced by the Iri&s;h farmer, as paid in that kingdom. It contains no charge of cows, calves, or fatted bullocks. But as it includes the value of the tithe of Sheep, if in his tour he had found in&s;tances of &s;uch payments, the average of them would have been in&s;erted in his general account: the produc|tions of the pa&s;ture lands of Ireland, being &s;o much more con|&s;iderable, in proportion to the arable, than that of any other nation; the e&s;tabli&s;hed church was thus deprived of a very con|&s;iderable part of its revenue. There are &s;ome conclu&s;ions, which may be drawn from the&s;e two mea&s;ures of the Iri&s;h Parliament.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is a pointed declaration again&s;t the te&s;t act in Ireland, though not an actual repeal of it: it was followed at a certain interval of time, by a vote which effectively &s;tripped the clergy of a con&s;iderable part of their revenues: and it may be taken as a proof, deduced from experience, that when a party in a public a&s;&s;embly, has influence enough to weaken the &s;upport a te&s;t act gives to an e&s;tabli&s;hed church; one con&s;tituent part of it, its revenues, are in danger.</P>
<P>It has been remarked above, that the fir&s;t of the&s;e decla|rations is not in the &s;tyle of an act of Parliament: and there is &s;o great a &s;imilitude in the expre&s;&s;ion of both, that they are to be taken as acts of the &s;ame nature.</P>
<P>Each of the&s;e declarations was an attempt of the Commons alone, to a&s;&s;ume &s;overeign legi&s;lative power: it was the pub|lication of one of its own ordinances, to controul or &s;uper&s;ede the law of the land; the machine employed by the long Par|liament to overturn the &s;tate; after the conce&s;&s;ions of the unfortunate Charles had peaceably e&s;tabli&s;hed the national liberty, or the little more then wanted to its perfection might have been ea&s;ily obtained.</P>
<P>Both of them likewi&s;e clo&s;ely follow the &s;pirit and form of tho&s;e acts of that u&s;urping and tyrannical democracy. For whereas the&s;e included &s;everal cla&s;&s;es of men, under the unde|fined criminal titles of malignants and delinquents; in the
<PB N="13" REF="12">
ordinances of the Iri&s;h hou&s;e of Commons, they are de&s;cribed in terms rather more &s;evere, as enemies to their country. Thus far the matter and nature of the&s;e two declarations, common to both, have been con&s;idered: but the compari&s;on of that, again&s;t the revenues of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church and the edicts of the long Parliament, pre&s;ents us with &s;ome further and material points of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. This &s;ingular difference is to be ob&s;erved between them, the cen&s;ures of the Engli&s;h republicans were directed again&s;t tho&s;e who either had, or were &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;tretched their delegated powers to a criminal extent; and again&s;t their abettors: but the Iri&s;h ordinance effectively deprived a cla&s;s of men of their pro|perty, to which, as it appears by the very terms of it, they had not forfeited their right, by any criminality, or &s;u&s;picion of criminality. As far as the effect of this order extended, and the obedience to it was complete, the clergy of Ireland were outlawed, <HI>ip&s;o facto,</HI> by the hou&s;e of Commons. This fact fortifies an old ob&s;ervation with one in&s;tance more: that there is a great &s;imilitude in the conduct of all invaders of the rights and privileges of the &s;ubject, whether they be indi|viduals or public bodies. The end of law is to protect rights and puni&s;h wrongs. James, in his attempt to degrade him|&s;elf from a &s;overeign to a tyrant, began by the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of laws; but the&s;e were penal laws: the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of laws, protecting the property of a cla&s;s of men, by one branch of the legi&s;lature, is a much more grievous exertion of u&s;urped and uncon&s;titutional power; the illegality which re&s;cues indi|viduals or bodies of men from puni&s;hment, being generally looked upon in a le&s;s atrocious light, than that which dive&s;ts them of their rights and properties.</P>
<P>It was further &s;tated, in the debate on the te&s;t act, that it was formally repealed in Ireland about eleven years ago, which, as may be gathered from the pa&s;&s;age quoted from Mr. Young, was &s;ome years after this vote of the Iri&s;h hou&s;e of

Commons; but when it was upon that occa&s;ion added, that the Church is in a flouri&s;hing &s;tate in that kingdom, as the fact given above demon&s;trates the contrary; the vote again&s;t the te&s;t act, at a due interval of time, having been followed by a vote effectively dimini&s;hing the revenues of the Church; third in order came the legal repeal of that act; &s;ince which, as the attention of the nation was for &s;ome years directed to the perfecting a great revolution; during which it was nece&s;|&s;ary, not to proceed too far again&s;t the clergy; the time elap&s;ed had not been &s;ufficient, much to dimini&s;h the appre|hen&s;ions that church may entertain, of &s;ome fourth mea&s;ure affecting her e&s;tabli&s;hment: and the conclu&s;ion of the advo|cates for the repeal, drawn from its pre&s;ent condition, that it is therefore a mea&s;ure proper to be copied in England, mu&s;t be rejected.</P>
<P>Among the Swi&s;s republics, it mu&s;t be admitted, that there are to be found in&s;tances of free &s;tates, who&s;e governments are not fluctuating in their principles, or di&s;tracted by the conte&s;ts of religious parties; and where the e&s;tabli&s;hed church flouri&s;hes, without the &s;upport of religious te&s;ts. But Dr. Adam Smith, in his inquiry into the cau&s;e of the wealth of nation&punc; gives us a fact, from which the &s;olution of this poli|tical phoenomenon is ea&s;ily derived. <Q>In the greater part of the prote&s;tant cantons, there is not a &s;ingle per&s;on to be found, who does not profe&s;s him&s;elf to be of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church: if he profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf of any other indeed, the law obliges him to leave the canton.</Q></P>
<P>But the rank the United Provinces hold among the States of Europe, render their hi&s;tory the mo&s;t &s;triking of tho&s;e, not excluded by the general exceptions at fir&s;t laid down, and it is in every re&s;pect the mo&s;t perfect example to be found, to decide the que&s;tion. The opponents of the te&s;t act appeal to it in their favour: but, when examined, it will &s;how, as far as the in&s;tance can extend, that it is nece&s;&s;ary for a &s;tate to
<PB N="15" REF="14">
e&s;tabli&s;h the religion of the mo&s;t numerous &s;ect it contains; by giving to it the privileges attending a national church; and intru&s;ting the executive power exclu&s;ively to its members.</P>
<P>In the evidence now to be brought in &s;upport of this propo|&s;ition, I &s;hall follow the account of the tran&s;actions of the Dutch Republic, as given in the modern univer&s;al hi&s;tory;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. 28.&mdash;It is con&s;tantly quoted by the number of the page in&s;erted in the text.</NOTE> the only authority to which I have acce&s;s. As the author ex|hibits in every particular, the mo&s;t liberal attachment to the principles of civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical liberty; the facts he has delivered, will be received by tho&s;e who concur with him in tho&s;e principles, with the credit due to &s;uch a relator.</P>
<P>The United Provinces obtained external peace, and an acknowledgement of their independence, in the year 1609: but the cau&s;es which were to interrupt their internal tranquil|lity, from that time to the pre&s;ent period, were already in action; though the fear of a foreign enemy had prevented their breaking forth in open violence. The divi&s;ion of the national church into two &s;ects was already begun; the leaders of whom were Gomarus, who was a rigid Calvini&s;t, and Arminius, who&s;e followers derive their name from him: and the latter were &s;tigmatized as de&s;erters from Calvini&s;m.</P>
<P>It is a general ob&s;ervation, that the externals of religion, its rites and ceremonies, afford mo&s;t frequently the occa&s;ion of the breaking out of di&s;&s;ention, render it mo&s;t acrimonious, and keep it longe&s;t alive: but the two contending &s;ects in Holland were not di&s;tingui&s;hed by any differences of this kind, as the church of England and the di&s;&s;enters have been. A declara<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion of the States general &s;ets forth, that <Q>both parties were of the &s;ame religion, had the &s;ame form of wor&s;hip, the &s;ame public ceremonies, the &s;ame manner of
<PB N="16" REF="15">
expo&s;ing vice and cheri&s;hing virtue; and differed only in a few points, of little con&s;equence to &s;alvation, or indeed to &s;ociety,</Q> (p. 44.)</P>
<P>It is evident, that one principal cau&s;e of the exi&s;tence, the acrimony, and continuation of religious di&s;putes, the differ|ence of external forms and rites, did not take place in Hol|land; and that they fully take place here. If therefore, the State do not &s;olicitou&s;ly guard it&s;elf again&s;t the effects of the ho&s;tility of religious parties, the calamities they will probably bring upon this country will be proportionally greater, and of longer duration than tho&s;e which afflicted the republic, upon the &s;urvey of which we are now entering.</P>
<P>No religious te&s;t excluded the followers of either &s;y&s;tem from the magi&s;tracy. It will be &s;hown, that the violence and di&s;&s;ention which prevailed in every di&s;trict, repeated revo|lutions in the form of government, and at certain intervals, the mo&s;t humiliating degree of national aba&s;ement, mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to this cau&s;e. The in&s;tances of the fir&s;t kind, having more re&s;emblance to calamities of a private nature, will be con&s;idered by them&s;elves; and the two la&s;t, as affecting the whole &s;tate, in conjunction. The&s;e articles will be run over, with all the brevity their importance to this argument will permit.</P>
<P>The whole country, &s;oon after the truce with Spain, be|came a &s;cene of violence and confu&s;ion: in towns, where the magi&s;trates were of the Arminian party, the mini&s;ters of the Calvini&s;ts were &s;u&s;pended, expelled, or impri&s;oned. And where the party of the Calvini&s;ts had the a&s;cendant, the Arminians &s;hared the &s;ame fate. (p. 39.) This di&s;traction was increa&s;ed by the populace a&s;&s;uming the &s;ame powers: <Q>Wherever either of the factions happened to be the mo&s;t powerful, they &s;eized on the churches, and excluded their opponents. (p. 45.) And &s;uch was the mutual animo&s;ity of the two &s;ects, that the Arminians were obliged to meet
<PB N="17" REF="16">
privately in &s;ome towns, and the Calvini&s;ts in others.</Q> (p. 44.) The Arminians of Am&s;terdam, having procured a mini&s;ter from Leyden, met in a large warehou&s;e belonging to a merchant, to hold their religious a&s;&s;emblies: the appli|cation of the Calvini&s;ts to &s;uppre&s;s this meeting, being di&s;|regarded by the magi&s;trates, the doors of the warehou&s;e were forced, the mini&s;ter abu&s;ed, and the lives of the congregation threatened. The Arminians in their turn complained to the magi&s;trates; but were an&s;wered, that <Q>the be&s;t method to &s;ecure them&s;elves, would be to avoid &s;uch meetings as in|curred the re&s;entment of their fellow citizens.</Q> (p. 46.) In the magi&s;tracy of Am&s;terdam, the Arminian party formed generally, though not always, the majority: the feeble and irre&s;olute inclination to favour that &s;ect, on the fir&s;t appli|cation, appears from &s;ome circum&s;tances, to have given way to a feeble inclination to di&s;countenance them, upon the &s;econd: and on both occa&s;ions, the executive power betrayed a &s;en&s;e of its own weakne&s;s, ari&s;ing from the divi&s;ion in reli|gious &s;entiments, of the individuals who compo&s;ed it.</P>
<P>In &s;uch a di&s;tracted &s;tate of &s;ociety, it is evident that each of the religious parties would frequently di&s;obey tho&s;e magi&s;|trates, who&s;e tenets oppo&s;ed their own. Some burghers of Am&s;terdam, having refu&s;ed obedience to certain Arminian magi&s;trates of that city, the populace e&s;pou&s;ed their cau&s;e: the riot was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by a detachment of the army: and the States, at their next meeting, pa&s;&s;ed an ordinance, <Q>whereby the people were required to obey the magi&s;trates, of what|ever &s;ect or religion they happened to profe&s;s them&s;elves.</Q> (p 95) The ordinance it&s;elf is very &s;ingular; but the di&s;|turbance which occa&s;ioned it, was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed without great difficulty: and the i&s;&s;uing &s;uch a general edict, after its &s;uppre&s;&s;ion, &s;eems to indicate, that di&s;turbances of this kind were very general; and the bonds of government nearly di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="17">At Leuwarde and Utrecht the populace u&s;urped the right of civil government; by depo&s;ing their legal magi&s;trates, the Burgoma&s;ters, and &s;ub&s;tituting others in their &s;tead by vio|lence. The promi&s;e of a &s;peedy redre&s;s to their complaints by the old Burgoma&s;ters of Utrecht, was not &s;ufficient to appea&s;e them. And the exce&s;&s;es of the faction ran to &s;o dangerous a height in that city, that the Stadtholder Prince Maurice, going to repre&s;s them, was gro&s;sly in&s;ulted, and forced to a precipitate retreat. (p. 42.) It appears, in the &s;ub&s;equent part of the hi&s;tory, that the in&s;urgents were of the Arminian party.</P>
<P>The internal commotions in particular di&s;tricts here men|tioned, oc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">urred in the period of the fir&s;t twenty years after the commencement of the di&s;pute. They exhibit a picture of the mutual violence of the two &s;ects, approaching very nearly to anarchy: and are the con&s;equences of the erroneous &s;y&s;tems of their laws relating to religion.</P>
<P>It is a matter not only intere&s;ting to the curio&s;ity of poli|tical inve&s;tigation, but intimately connected with the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, to inquire, whether, if the Engli&s;h &s;y&s;tem of religious laws had at that time taken place in Holland, that country would not, in its con&s;titution, have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an adequate pre|ventative to the&s;e internal di&s;orders.</P>
<P>By the law of England, the religion of the majority is e&s;tabli&s;hed, and that e&s;tabli&s;hment is guarded by a religious te&s;t; but the di&s;&s;enters from the church are tolerated.</P>
<P>The greater part of the inhabitants of Holland being Cal|vini&s;ts, their religion would have been e&s;tabli&s;hed: it would likewi&s;e have been the religion of all the magi&s;trates. There would have therefore been no expul&s;ion of Arminian mini&s;ters from the public churches; becau&s;e there would have been none of the clergy of that &s;ect in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them.</P>
<P>If by a te&s;t act, none but the members of the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church, the Calvini&s;ts, had been able to act as magi&s;trates;
<PB N="19" REF="18">
the Arminian magi&s;trates could not have expelled the clergy of the Calvini&s;tic belief from their churches; becau&s;e there would have been no &s;uch magi&s;trates.</P>
<P>If be&s;ides, a toleration had been granted; neither &s;ect could have deprived or mole&s;ted the other in the free exerci&s;e of its religion; for the one would have been e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the other tolerated.</P>
<P>Neither would the members of the &s;maller &s;ect, in tho&s;e di&s;tricts where they were the mo&s;t numerous, have been &s;o ready to deny obedience to the magi&s;trates of the oppo&s;ite &s;ect; or to di&s;place them and &s;et up others, contrary to law. For &s;uch a denial mu&s;t have amounted to a refu&s;al to obey the total magi&s;tracy of the &s;tate: it is a total di&s;avowal of all civil &s;ubjection, or rebellion. But, as there were other magi&s;trates of their own &s;ect, the di&s;obedience appeared to them to be only partial. Be&s;ide, the appearance of force in readine&s;s to reduce them to their duty, would be much greater in one ca&s;e than in the other: in the one, it would be the total civil power of the country, in union with the majority of the people; in the other, that civil power would be di&s;|united; by which, the offenders might perhaps hope for indemnity, if not &s;ucce&s;s, in their bolde&s;t attempts.</P>
<P>This univer&s;al &s;cene of tumult, which &s;eems to have per|vaded every province, every city, every town, produced corre&s;pondent effects in the government and con&s;titution: and has been the cau&s;e of the repeated revolutions, which have at certain intervals taken place in the republic, from the year 1609 to the pre&s;ent time. <Q>The di&s;pute between Arminius and Gomarus,</Q> &s;ays the hi&s;torian here exclu|&s;ively followed, <Q>laid the fir&s;t conception of a humour, that has ever &s;ince laid lurking in the con&s;titution of the &s;tate, breaking out upon all revolutions, and laying the foun|dation of that di&s;union and di&s;cord, which will probably terminate one day in the total &s;ubver&s;ion of the republic.</Q>
<PB N="20" REF="19">
(p. 36.) We are now to trace its initial and continued operation upon the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>For &s;ome time previous to the conclu&s;ion of the twelve years truce, by which the independence of the United Pro|vinces was admitted by Spain, a political party began to entertain apprehen&s;ions of the ambition of Maurice, the &s;econd Stadtholder, and to form a declared oppo&s;ition to him: the great Barneveldt was impre&s;&s;ed with the &s;ame fears; and &s;ome &s;tates in the union were much influenced by his authority. (p. 22.)</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ition excited mutual re&s;entment between the&s;e two leaders of the republic: the parti&s;ans of Maurice &s;upported the cau&s;e of the Calvini&s;ts, the mo&s;t numerous &s;ect; which al&s;o, at &s;ome periods, &s;eems to have been favoured by the &s;tates: Barneveldt, and &s;ome of his cities, inclined to the Arminian party. Encouraged by the expectation of &s;upport from the&s;e powerful patrons, the magi&s;trates of each &s;ect, in their &s;everal di&s;tricts, proceeded to &s;u&s;pend tho&s;e mini&s;ters, who&s;e religious opinions differed from their own. The&s;e mea&s;ures drew on an inundation of writings, in which, the con&s;titution of every branch of the executive government was called into que&s;tion. As they directly <Q>led to an inquiry into the rights and powers of the magi&s;trates; this into the prerogative of the Stadtholder of the &s;everal Provinces; and that into the &s;overeign right of the provincial States, and States general.</Q> (p. 39.) Topics not likely, during &s;uch a univer&s;al ferment, to be candidly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, or to tend to allay it.</P>
<P>Prince Maurice, at the head of an army devoted to him, knew how to derive the greate&s;t advantage from the &s;trength of a religious party, con&s;tituting a great majority of the people; and who regarded him likewi&s;e as their chief, though not yet avowedly &s;o. The ignominious expul&s;ion of Gi&s;elius, a &s;editious preacher of the Calvini&s;ts, from Rotterdam, fur|ni&s;hed
<PB N="21" REF="20">
occa&s;ion to their adver&s;aries, to &s;tigmatize the body of the Arminians, as &s;ecret friends to Spain, and enemies to the liberties of their country. By what means this event could produce &s;uch an effect, &s;eems difficult to conceive: but <Q>the pa&s;&s;ions of the people being thus inflamed again&s;t them, Maurice ventured on &s;ome bold and dangerous alterations in the civil government; changing the magi&s;trates of the cities at plea&s;ure, &s;o as to maintain a majority in the provin|cial States; and con&s;equently in the States general.</Q> (p. 43.) Thus he was enabled to advance one great &s;tep, to carry his authority beyond the bounds marked out by the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>When two religious parties are in a &s;tate of ho&s;tility, the &s;upreme magi&s;trate will generally be able to increa&s;e his &s;trength, by the acce&s;&s;ion of that of the greater; and convert a con&s;iderable part of their religious fervour into the means of carrying on his de&s;igns; if he be able to impo&s;e upon them, with the &s;lighte&s;t appearance of &s;ervice to the common cau&s;e. The truth of this principle appears in the tran&s;action ju&s;t recited. Such a &s;ect being attacked, or any of its &s;upports attempted to be taken away, a very intimate junction of this nature will probably be formed; and its occa&s;ion continuing, it may acquire &s;uch &s;trength, as ultimately to produce bad effects. But if a legal &s;upport, in which it acquie&s;ces, be granted to &s;uch a powerful church; that too intimate degree of connection with the &s;upreme magi&s;trate, will by degrees die away; and his civil power be &s;upported by its members upon civil con&s;iderations only. Thus in England, after the failure of &s;ome attempts to repeal the te&s;t act, had given an appearance of permanent &s;ecurity to the e&s;tabli&s;hment; the apprehen&s;ions of the national church for its &s;ecurity died away; and tho&s;e principles, which perhaps at one time attached its members too much to monarchical power, died away with them. What &s;y&s;tem of new mea&s;ures will naturally tend to revive them, is very evident.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="21">Men intent upon obtaining illegal power, and on trampling on the laws and liberties of their country, will, in &s;imilar &s;ituations, pur&s;ue &s;imilar plans. It was about thirty-&s;ix years after this time, that Cromwell carried both parts of this mea&s;ure of prince Maurice into execution, but upon a larger &s;cale: the fir&s;t, when he impri&s;oned forty members of the hou&s;e of Commons, and by Sir Hardre&s;s Waller demanded the exclu&s;ion of ninety more; to obtain a majority in that a&s;&s;embly, upon the vote to receive no me&s;&s;ages from the King; and for an act, to erect a court to bring him to trial. And the &s;econd, when he inve&s;ted a few mi&s;erable fanatics, by his own commi&s;&s;ion, with the name and authority of a Parliament. It is not &s;tepping much out of the way to have drawn this parallel: for, as far as the civil war in England was a reli|gious war, it was kindled by the theological di&s;putes of Arminius and Gomarus: for the principles of the former being brought over into England, excited as fierce com|motions between the Calvini&s;ts and Arminians, as had taken place in Holland.</P>
<P>From the conduct of the cities of Leuwarde and Utrecht, it may be imagined, that the Arminians them&s;elves indirectly aided the Prince in his plan of u&s;urpation; by their illegal violences in expelling their lawful magi&s;trates, and in&s;ulting his per&s;on when he came to re&s;tore them.</P>
<P>The Prince having, by the&s;e changes in the magi&s;tracy, obtained a majority in the States general, the Calvini&s;ts &s;oli|cited for a national &s;ynod to &s;it under their authority; which was carried, but not unanimou&s;ly; the mea&s;ure being oppo&s;ed by the provincial &s;tates of Holland and Utrecht. (p. 42.) Two alliances, offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive, were thus contracted: the fir&s;t, between the Calvini&s;ts and the majority of the States; the &s;econd, between the Arminians, Utrecht, and the powerful province of Holland. The divi&s;ion, formed at this juncture, has already &s;ub&s;i&s;ted much more than a century

and a half, has occa&s;ioned many revolutions, and alternately brought the republic very near to a &s;tate of anarchy, and a &s;tate of de&s;poti&s;m.</P>
<P>A little pau&s;e en&s;ued, before the parties, thus regularly e&s;tabli&s;hed and oppo&s;ed to each other, came into action; during which, Barneveldt endeavoured to appea&s;e the national di&s;&s;entions by different expedients: one of which was, that "certain eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws &s;hould be confirmed by the &s;tates."

Yet he is of the party of Barneveldt.</P></NOTE> The a&s;&s;umption of a power by the civil magi&s;trates to draw up articles of religion, without their deliberations being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by an a&s;&s;embly of the national clergy, would perhaps never be tolerated at any enlightened period of time, or in any government: much le&s;s in the circum&s;tances which then took place. Barneveldt was un&s;ucce&s;sful: many of the &s;tates refu&s;ed their &s;anction to any &s;y&s;tem of religious opinions, which had not previou&s;ly been debated in a convocation of divines.</P>
<P>Much of the bitterne&s;s with which the two factions were animated again&s;t each other, certainly aro&s;e from the inflam|matory publications, &s;o abundantly at that time circulated. Barneveldt, in order to allay the inveterate &s;pirit of ho&s;tility derived from this &s;ource, was guilty of another error; he propo&s;ed re&s;training the liberty of the pre&s;s: this was wi&s;ely oppo&s;ed by the magi&s;trates of Am&s;terdam; <Q>notwith&s;tanding that their own conduct was the &s;ubject of the &s;evere&s;t &s;atires and pa&s;quinades, which had yet appeared.</Q> (p. 45.) His intention was certainly good; although the mean by which
<PB N="24" REF="23">
he attempted to effect it, was bad. He might probably think, that there were certain times, at which it might become nece&s;&s;ary to impo&s;e a temporary re&s;traint upon the freedom of the pre&s;s, by an act of the legi&s;lature; as in England, under certain circum&s;tances, it is expedient to &s;u&s;pend the Habeas Corpus. This is given as the apology of the man, not of the mea&s;ure. But as nothing is more ho&s;tile to the peace of man|kind, than religious rancour: and as a contemptuous repre|&s;entation, or mi&s;repre&s;entation, of the tenets of any religious &s;ociety, are the infallible means of carrying its virulence to the mo&s;t noxious exce&s;s; &s;ociety has no greater enemies, than tho&s;e who thus exerci&s;e their perverted abilities: the &s;evere and liberal indignation of the wi&s;e and good of their own party, &s;eems the ju&s;t, the proper, and the adequate puni&s;h|ment of &s;uch offenders.

But &s;uch is the equality of the &s;tipends of the mini&s;ters in Holland, that they would have le&s;s frequently been &s;o induced to accept of the terms of the edict, than at fir&s;t might be imagined: and the States, as &s;oon as it was i&s;&s;ued, were virtually obliged to di&s;pen&s;e with the ob&s;ervance of it.</P>
<P>Such were the mea&s;ures applied by the mild patrioti&s;m of Barneveldt, to heal the di&s;orders of the &s;tate, which were continually increa&s;ing. By the vices of its original con&s;ti|tution, they had already become too violent for palliatives: the total authority of government being placed in the hand
<PB N="26" REF="25">
of the contending parties them&s;elves, there no where exi&s;ted a force to repre&s;s the outrages of either; which could termi|nate only by &s;ome dangerous cri&s;is. Prince Maurice deter|mined to profit by the occa&s;ion, and probably to u&s;urp the &s;overeignty: but, as he fore&s;aw that this would be much ea&s;ier, if he could gain over Barneveldt to his party, he determined to attempt it: his attempts failed. Some mea|&s;ures of the Pen&s;ionary, and &s;ome &s;trong proceedings of the Arminian party, he had the addre&s;s to per&s;uade the populace to be renewed proofs of their being parti&s;ans of Spain, and enemies of public liberty: this adding to the &s;trength of a party already almo&s;t triumphant, he pulled off the ma&s;k; and, as he had before &s;ecretly favoured the Calvini&s;ts only, he now openly &s;et him&s;elf at their head.</P>
<P>Encouraged by this declaration, the Calvini&s;ts in Holland threw off all re&s;pect for Barneveldt and the provincial States, breaking out into open violence; and they were obliged to apply to the Prince for troops for their protection. He eluded their application, and forbad the &s;oldiery even to a&s;&s;i&s;t the magi&s;trates of the towns of Holland in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing &s;edition: upon which, they determined to augment the guards and garri&s;ons by their own authority. (p. 47.)</P>
<P>This &s;tep Maurice pretended to re&s;ent, as an encroachment upon his prerogative, as governor of the province; and &s;eizes, in a ho&s;tile manner, on the Briel, Delft, and Scheidam; changes the magi&s;trates of Nimeguen, and the province of Guelderland enters cordially into his mea&s;ures. And al|though certain cities had refu&s;ed him admittance; (p. 47.) and Barneveldt, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the emba&s;&s;ador of France, had been able to appea&s;e the di&s;putes in the provincial States of Holland; (p. 49.) yet, after &s;ome feeble attempts <Q>to prevail with the Prince, to &s;uffer the garri&s;ons to be under the direction of the magi&s;trates, and to relinqui&s;h his project for the retrenching the privileges of the cities.</Q>
<PB N="27" REF="26">
(p. 53.) <Q>Unable to oppo&s;e his further de&s;igns, his oppo|nents determined to connive at his mea&s;ures.</Q> (p. 54.) <Q>They perceived that the lea&s;t tumult would furni&s;h a pre|text for &s;imilar tre&s;pa&s;&s;es on the con&s;titution; and the means of rendering him&s;elf ab&s;olute in the Cities, and con&s;equently in the provincial States.</Q> (p. 55.)</P>
<P>Maurice now, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the military, &s;eized the city of Utrecht, di&s;armed the garri&s;on, degraded the magi&s;|trates, and cau&s;ed new ones to be appointed in their places; changed the form of government, (p 54.) and expelled the Arminian clergy from their churches. The <Q>cities of Hol|land were afterwards &s;erved in a &s;imilar manner.</Q> (p. 55.)</P>
<P>It &s;till remained nece&s;&s;ary to the ultimate completion of the de&s;igns of the Prince, to gain or to de&s;troy Barneveldt: and it &s;eems to have been greatly his wi&s;h to &s;ucceed in the fir&s;t of the&s;e ways. For at this very time, he was loading his relations with favours; and conferred upon his two &s;ons, two of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable po&s;ts of the republic: but he was un&s;ucce&s;sful: and the national &s;ynod, &s;o long the object of apprehen&s;ion to Barneveldt and the Arminians, met at Dor|drecht. (p. 56.)</P>
<P>The Arminians refu&s;ing to appear, to defend them&s;elves before this a&s;&s;embly, as the per&s;ons who mu&s;t be their judges there, were actually parties in the di&s;pute; they were of cour&s;e condemned in their ab&s;ence. The pa&s;&s;ions of the popu|lace were wrought up to the highe&s;t violence again&s;t them, by the eloquent and flagitious Aer&s;ens: and Maurice, by <Q>order of the States, "&s;eized upon Barneveldt, Grotius, Hoogenberts, and the other leaders of the Arminians, whom he impri&s;oned in the ca&s;tle of Louve&s;tien: whence that party has ever &s;ince borrowed the appellation.</Q> (p. 57.)</P>
<P>Judges were appointed to try Barneveldt for &s;edition, and harbouring de&s;igns de&s;tructive to liberty: he was condemned
<PB N="28" REF="27">
and executed. The fruits Maurice reaped from this exe|cution, were very different from tho&s;e with which he had flattered him&s;elf. The man, whom, when alive, the populace had execrated as the enemy of his country, as &s;oon as he was dead, was revered as the martyr of the con&s;titution. Two of his de&s;cendants, a &s;on, (p. 58.) and a grand&s;on, at different times attempted to revenge the legal murder of Barneveldt, by the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of Maurice. The latter, in his criminal enterpri&s;e, was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a number of the Arminians; (p. 63) which involved the whole &s;ect in a new per&s;ecution. By a particular ordinance, pecuniary rewards were offered to tho&s;e, who &s;hould ACCUSE any of the Louve&s;tien party with de&s;igns again&s;t the government or the prince. (p. 64.) <Q>And &s;everal per&s;ons were beheaded, only becau&s;e they were Arminians, and con&s;equently &s;uppo&s;ed favourers of the violent mea&s;ures, upon which, &s;ome turbulent and bigotted individuals of the &s;ame faction had entered.</Q> (p. 65.) A renewal of the Spani&s;h war, which broke out with great violence after the expiration of the long truce, and threatened even the exi&s;tence of the republic as a &s;overeign &s;tate; pre|vented Maurice from taking advantage of the&s;e circum&s;tances, who &s;urvived his e&s;cape from the la&s;t of the&s;e attempts two years.</P>
<P>He was &s;ucceeded in his authority by his brother Henry&punc; and the Arminians, who were now generally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with an implacable hatred to the hou&s;e of Orange, reanimated by his death, formed a de&s;ign of revenging their late &s;ufferings. They were re&s;trained by the more moderate men among them; and &s;ome lenient declarations of Henry &s;econded their conciliating interpo&s;itions. But at this juncture, he does not appear to have acted with &s;incerity: he flattered the abilities of Grotius, the &s;econd man in the party during the life of Barneveldt; but he compelled him to linger out the remain|der of his life in exile: he permitted a new per&s;ecution of
<PB N="29" REF="28">
the&s;e &s;ectaries; and it was even propo&s;ed wholly to &s;uppre&s;s Arminiani&s;m, by compelling all its profe&s;&s;ors to &s;ub&s;cribe to certain articles of faith, drawn up by the Calvini&s;ts: a mea&s;ure, which mu&s;t have been followed by more fatal effects, than tho&s;e which already had afflicted the republic during this di&s;pute: but the apprehen&s;ions of a foreign inva&s;ion occa&s;ioned it to be laid a&s;ide. (p. 85.)</P>
<P>During the war which en&s;ued, a few indulgencies were extended to the Louve&s;tien party: &s;ome of them appear to have been admitted into the magi&s;tracy of Am&s;terdam: and it was on account of the oppo&s;ition made to them, that the &s;tate found it nece&s;&s;ary to i&s;&s;ue the &s;ingular ordinance men|tioned above.</P>
<P>Henry conducted the war with ability, and after its con|clu&s;ion, governed the republic with moderation: which &s;o far engaged the gratitude of the people, that they made the Stadtholder&s;hip hereditary in his family. This event imme|diately followed the abortive attempt of Cardinal Richelieu to &s;eize the city of Orange, the patrimony of the Prince, &s;ituated in an interior part of France; which laid the foun|dation of the oppo&s;ition to that nation, which the hou&s;e of Orange has on all occa&s;ions &s;hown: and, as its &s;econdary con&s;equence, threw the Arminian party into the arms of that powerful kingdom. (p. 108.)</P>
<P>It was thus, that a bad &s;y&s;tem of religious laws, which had for a long &s;eries of years filled the provinces with di&s;cord, violences, and atrocious crimes; after having been nearly de&s;tructive to public liberty, ultimately gave birth to a foreign faction in their dome&s;tic councils: a new and fertile &s;ource of national degradation and calamity. This junction, however, did not take place early enough to produce any appa|rent effect, during the remainder of the &s;plendid and fortunate admini&s;tration of this Prince; which la&s;ted on the whole
<PB N="30" REF="29">
twenty-two years: at the end of which term, he was &s;ucceeded by his &s;on William, the &s;econd Stadtholder of that name.</P>
<P>His acce&s;&s;ion did not take place, without a delay to it being interpo&s;ed, on the part of &s;ome of the Provinces. (p. 160.) The Arminians had already recovered &s;trength enough to begin on their &s;ide, to make encroachments on the con&s;ti|tution. The peace of Mun&s;ter, which was then negociating, followed &s;oon after: and it appeared, when the debate con|cerning the reduction of the land-forces of the republic came on in the a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates, that the Louve&s;tien party had re-acquired a total a&s;cendancy in the great province of Hol|land. The difference of the military peace e&s;tabli&s;hments, propo&s;ed to be kept up by both parties, was &s;o minute, as to make it evident, that the matter taken up was only the o&s;ten&s;ible ground of divi&s;ion; while the real &s;ubject of di&s;pute was kept out of &s;ight. Animo&s;ities ran to a great height: and the States general, determined to bear down the oppo|&s;ition of the refractory Provinces, &s;ent expre&s;s orders to the officers of the army, not to obey any requi&s;ition they might receive from the States of Holland. (p. 170.)</P>
<P>That Province remaining fixed in its oppo&s;ition, the Prince, &s;econded by the council of &s;tate, obtained a re&s;olution from the States general, that a deputation &s;hould be &s;ent to the towns of Holland, <Q>to oblige the magi&s;trates to alter their &s;entiments.</Q> (p. 170.) He put him&s;elf at the head of the deputies, and they were refu&s;ed admi&s;&s;ion at Am&s;terdam, and mo&s;t of the other towns; and in &s;ome with in&s;ult and con|tempt. On his return to the States, he arraigned the conduct of the cities with &s;everity: the &s;peech he made on this occa|&s;ion was printed, to inflame the minds of the clergy and populace of his party; and was an&s;wered by a manife&s;to of the States of Holland.</P>
<P>To the&s;e cau&s;es of mutual animo&s;ity, was &s;uperadded an incident, which cau&s;ed a civil war immediately to break out.
<PB N="31" REF="30">
A fleet, under Admiral De Wit, returned at this time from an un&s;ucce&s;sful expedition to the Brazils: and the conduct of the commander and his officers was &s;trongly impeached, De Wit was arre&s;ted, and the States general ordered &s;ix of the captains of the fleet, who had received their commi&s;&s;ions from them, into confinement in the pri&s;on of the admiralty of Am&s;terdam. In this they had all ancient precedents in their favour: but the province of Holland remon&s;trated again&s;t the order, as a violation of its local &s;overeignty; it was carried into execution notwith&s;tanding that oppo&s;ition: but the pri&s;on doors were forced by the magi&s;trates of Am&s;terdam, and the pri&s;oners &s;et at liberty. (p. 172.)</P>
<P>William immediately confined the &s;ix deputies of the pro|vince, and marched a body of troops towards that capital; which, but for &s;ome unfore&s;een accidents, mu&s;t have fallen into his hands without &s;triking a blow. The city was however terrified into a humiliating treaty; by which the deputies of Holland, though relea&s;ed from their confinement, were de|prived of their employment: as were two popular magi&s;trates of Am&s;terdam, who de&s;erved and acquired the admiration of their country, by in&s;i&s;ting to be made &s;acrifices, by being deprived of their offices, and declared incapable of holding any dignity in the republic, rather than involve it in a civil war.</P>
<P>Whatever further enterpri&s;es this Prince might have in contemplation, his &s;udden death, at the age of twenty-four, put a &s;top to them. His widow, the Prince&s;s Mary of England, was delivered of a &s;on a few days after.</P>
<P>His death deprived his party of a head, and filled them with de&s;pondency; and all the towns of Holland with exul|tation and fe&s;tivity. The States of that province, after having abrogated many of the powers before po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Stadt|holder, eluded all applications to nominate the infant Prince to that dignity; with a lieutenant to perform the functions
<PB N="32" REF="31">
of it during his minority. By this conduct, they evinced an early determination to lay a&s;ide the office intirely. And although, during their un&s;ucce&s;sful war with the Engli&s;h com|monwealth, there were perpetual commotions and in&s;urrections of the populace, who demanded the creation of a Stadtholder, a mea&s;ure &s;trongly pre&s;&s;ed by Van Trump the elder, and &s;ome of the Provinces; every interpo&s;ition to this end was rejected by the governing party, who <Q>a&s;&s;erted, that the re&s;toration of that dignity would be the ruin of liberty.</Q> (p. 191.)</P>
<P>The celebrated De Wit was now rai&s;ed to the office of Pen&s;ionary of Holland: he put an end to the Engli&s;h war by a treaty with Cromwell; one great article of which was, that a &s;olemn act &s;hould be pa&s;&s;ed by the States general, to exclude the young Prince of Orange from the Stadtholder&s;hip; and the other offices po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by his ance&s;tors. As during the &s;ub&s;equent part of his life, the Pen&s;ionary con&s;tantly oppo&s;ed the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of that office; the great oppo&s;ition which he affected to give to this condi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion of the treaty, &s;eems to have been calculated only to conciliate the Orange party to him: and to make him appear compelled to accept of an article, &s;o agreeable to his own views, and the intere&s;t of his party. It was by the edict pa&s;&s;ed in con&s;equence of this treaty, that the fir&s;t revolution of the Dutch con&s;titution, which before had effectively taken place, was completed by the formality of a law.</P>
<P>The term of the commotions hitherto de&s;cribed, extended to forty-five years. Their principal cau&s;e has been &s;hown to have been the committing of the executive power indifferently to the individuals of two &s;ects, di&s;agreeing about ab&s;tract opinions only; yet, having no external badges or marks of di&s;tinction in their rites and ceremonies; a &s;ource of di&s;&s;en|tion generally more fatal and more permanent. In con&s;e|quence of this erroneous &s;y&s;tem, and the internal di&s;orders occa&s;ioned by it, we have &s;een the foederal Chief of the United
<PB N="33" REF="32">
Provinces, twice in that period, upon the very point of &s;ub|duing the liberties of his country: and the Louve&s;tien party at length able to annihilate that office; and leave the States, of which the Republic is compo&s;ed, without a common head: that center of union of councils and execution, which to their divided and equal powers, is &s;o vitally nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>We are now arrived at that juncture, when the Louve&s;tien party, the lea&s;t numerous and powerful, whether they be con|&s;idered as a religious &s;ect, or a political faction; a&s;&s;umed the reins of government, in oppo&s;ition to the majority of the nation, and the national church. The Pen&s;ionary De Wit guided their councils: and the &s;pirit of his admini&s;tration was &s;uch as his &s;ituation rendered nece&s;&s;ary; and what ap|pears the con&s;equence of the executive power being inve&s;ted in the weaker party. His &s;y&s;tem of mea&s;ures is to be con|&s;idered with re&s;pect to the church, the navy, the army, and the foreign connections of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>It does not appear, that the Calvini&s;ts were treated with that violence, with which both &s;ects mutually harra&s;&s;ed each other, before the &s;ynod of Dordretcht: to have added &s;trength and acrimony to their oppo&s;ition by impolitic &s;everities, might &s;oon have been fatal to the new con&s;titution. Yet the clergy of Holland, the enemies of De Wit's admini&s;tration, declaimed again&s;t it violently from the pulpit, and <Q>the States were under a nece&s;&s;ity of prohibiting them to med|dle with public affairs; however they per&s;i&s;ted, and &s;ome of them were &s;u&s;pended.</Q> (p. 260.)</P>
<P>The marine of the Provinces was &s;upported upon a re&s;pect|able footing; and the fir&s;t of their war with Charles II. did not terminate either to their di&s;grace or di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">advantage. Yet the divi&s;ions of the &s;tate affected its operations: Op<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">am, who conducted the fir&s;t action, was in oppo&s;ition to the Pen&s;ionary: and <Q>&s;everal captains had been promoted, by the intere&s;t of the governing party, to be &s;pies upon his conduct, without
<PB N="34" REF="33">
any regard to merit.</Q> (p. 257.) While the engagement was yet undecided, they withdrew them&s;elves from the line; which decided the fate of the day, at that time perhaps doubt|ful. Toward the conclu&s;ion of the war, great animo&s;ities broke out between De Ruyter and Van Tromp the younger, the two be&s;t admirals of the republic, who were of different parties: and <Q>the &s;eamen, entering into the quarrel of their commanders, formed two oppo&s;ite factions, came to blows, and threatened the di&s;&s;olution of the government.</Q> (p. 269.)</P>
<P>The&s;e alarming &s;ymptoms had been ju&s;t di&s;pelled by &s;u|per&s;eding Van Tromp; when the Republic, at that time dejected by recent defeat and di&s;appointment, was menaced by a new revolution; which, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the public enemy, was to have re&s;tored the former authority of the hou&s;e of Orange. An inferior agent in this de&s;ign was apprehended and executed: but the con&s;pirators were &s;o numerous, and their party &s;o powerful, that it was found nece&s;&s;ary to &s;uppre&s;s the di&s;coveries made by him. The weakne&s;s of the party in admini&s;tration had &s;o far annihilated the power of the law, that they were obliged to affect to believe a body of men calumniated; again&s;t whom they had convincing proofs of entering into a con&s;piracy with the enemy in time of war, becau&s;e they dared not bring them to public ju&s;tice. (p. 270)</P>
<P>The rotal ruin of the army was another con&s;equence of the debility of the party, who then conducted public affairs. They were obliged to dimini&s;h the influence of the oppo&s;ition, and increa&s;e their own, by means the mo&s;t de&s;tructive to public &s;ecurity: hence, although De Wit found him&s;elf com|pelled to reduce the military e&s;tabli&s;hment, for rea&s;ons which will be afterward explained, yet, in the pro&s;ecution of this plan, <Q>while the old experienced officers were laid a&s;ide, on account of their attachment to the Prince of Orange; under who&s;e ance&s;tors they had acquired all their know|ledge.</Q>
<PB N="35" REF="34">(p. 279.) <Q>For &s;ome years, all military employ|ments had been held by the children of Burgoma&s;ters; becau&s;e they were generally in the intere&s;t of the Pen|&s;ioner:</Q> (p. 279.) <Q>the &s;ons and kindred of his own friends, raw, inexperienced youths, who had never beheld the face of an enemy.</Q> (p. 287.) During the fir&s;t war with Charles II. the Bi&s;hop of Mun&s;ter invaded the Provinces at the head of 8000 men: (p. 263.) an adver&s;ary and a force intirely unequal to a conte&s;t with the armies of the Republic, in the time of her former elevation and power: her troops were now found to be "perfectly u&s;ele&s;s;" (p. 279) "Terror diffu&s;ed it&s;elf through all the Provinces," upon this in&s;ignificant inva&s;ion: and it was only by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of 6000 men, with which France was by treaty obliged to furni&s;h the States, that they were able to repel this attack.</P>
<P>In the &s;y&s;tem of policy which De Wit embraced, with regard to foreign &s;tates, the criminality and weakne&s;s of his mea&s;ures at lea&s;t equalled that of ruining the army. The natural &s;trength of his party, increa&s;ed by the influence he had &s;o acquired, was not found to be &s;ufficient to retain the reins of government in his hands: to effect this, the inter|po&s;ition of a foreign power in the dome&s;tic concerns of the &s;tate, became nece&s;&s;ary: which, as far as it is admitted, is always virtually a partial &s;urrender of national independence; and a tacit &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to a foreign &s;overeign. Though it was already become evident, that Lewis XIV. was <Q>more dan|gerous as an ally, than as an open enemy; the Pen&s;ioner engaged him&s;elf deeply with that Prince; and his coun|tenance afforded him the be&s;t &s;upport again&s;t the hou&s;e of Orange.</Q> (p. 274.) He felt all the con&s;equences which his own &s;ituation and that of his party brought upon the nation, who&s;e <Q>&s;ecurity could not be provided for without a military force; and that &s;uch a force could not be rai&s;ed, paid, and di&s;ciplined, while the republic was divided; and the more
<PB N="36" REF="35">
popular party excluded from all public employments.</Q> (p. 283.) In &s;uch a &s;ituation, what was the line of con|duct he &s;y&s;tematically pur&s;ued? <Q>His complai&s;ance for the court of France, occa&s;ioned his extingui&s;hing every &s;park of military &s;pirit in the republic, by di&s;banding the greater part of the army;</Q> (p. 287.) and he ruined the remainder, which was inadequate to any purpo&s;e of defence, by the conduct &s;tated before. This reduction of the army was probably made at the requi&s;ition of Lewis XIV. as the price of his protection: for when Charles II. had rendered him&s;elf dependant upon that prince for an annual pen&s;ion, a &s;imilar propo&s;al was urged to him, which he rejected with vivacity.</P>
<P>When De Wit had thus di&s;armed Holland, Lewis XIV. thought the opportunity of converting his influence over the Provinces into a direct &s;overeignty, too flattering to be pa&s;&s;ed by. This was his motive for attacking the republic in the year 1672. At the juncture that his intention became evident, the union of the two parties in Holland, could apparently have oppo&s;ed but an in&s;ufficient barrier to the power of France, as the country was without an army, and without fortifications: (p. 287.) yet <Q>neither &s;ide appeared to have any thoughts of pre&s;erving the republic by a coalition, or even a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of their ani|mo&s;ity; perhaps from a conviction that it was imprac|ticable.</Q> (p. 284.) The Louve&s;tien faction fore&s;aw, that a war would transfer a great part, or the whole of their power to their opponents; and they made the mo&s;t abject &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to the king of France to retain it. <Q>They pro|mi&s;ed immediately to redre&s;s all his Maje&s;ty's complaints, to remove from their councils every per&s;on who had in|curred his di&s;plea&s;ure, and to &s;quare their conduct intirely by his royal will.</Q> (p. 284.) Thus the weaker of the two &s;ects which prevailed in this country, becoming po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the executive power, reduced it to the lowe&s;t degradation, that of offering to confer, by a &s;olemn treaty, an effective
<PB N="37" REF="36">
&s;overeignty upon an invader; <Q>by &s;tipulating to &s;quare their conduct intirely by his royal will:</Q> and as they had deter|mined not to try the experiment of &s;urrendering a &s;hare of the admini&s;tration to the majority, it is not ea&s;y to conceive any third mea&s;ure, which they could have adopted with any probability of &s;ucce&s;s. Great as the&s;e offers were, they did not &s;atisfy the rapacious ambition of Lewis: perhaps he thought, that they added but little, be&s;ide legality and form, to the influence he before po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in their government. But the power of the Louve&s;tien faction, and the humiliation of the States, were now approaching to their end.</P>
<P>William, the young Prince of Orange, had been already &s;et at the head of their ruined army. (p. 287.) He de&s;pi&s;ed a tributary &s;overeignty of the Provinces remaining uncon|quered, which had been offered him by the enemy, as his &s;hare of the plunder of his country. But while he infu&s;ed life and vigour into its councils, <Q>he inflamed the populace again&s;t the Pen&s;ioner and his brother:</Q> (p. 293.) Thus excited, they ran to arms in the greater cities, and inviting the Prince of Orange, compel the magi&s;trates to inve&s;t him with all the dignities which had been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by his ance&s;tors. <Q>They purged the public offices of all di&s;agreeable per&s;ons; called upon the Prince to fill the vacancies; introduced into the magi&s;tracy, all the adherents of his family; and in&s;i&s;ted that their own deputies &s;hould have &s;eats in the admini&s;|tration; contrary to the fundamental laws of the con&s;ti|tution.</Q> (p. 294.) The two De Wits were ma&s;&s;acred by them; and the Prince of Orange was now placed at the head of the republic. At Am&s;terdam, the preten&s;ions of the populace, which amounted to little le&s;s than the &s;ubver&s;ion of the con&s;titution, were inforced by the mo&s;t dreadful menaces: <Q>and the great de&s;ign &s;eems to have been, to &s;hare the government between the Stadtholder and the populace: whatever demands were made by the people, the Stadt|holder

immediately granted:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This a&s;&s;ertion undoubtedly &s;tands in need of &s;ome qualification: William did not &s;econd the requi&s;itions of the people, that their deputies &s;hould have a &s;eat in the admini&s;tration.</P></NOTE> the power of the nobility was every where the object of jealou&s;y: all authority was ve&s;ted in his Highne&s;s; the States were &s;carce ever named; the legi&s;lative and executive powers were wholly at his mercy; and the con&s;titution &s;eemed intirely unhinged.</Q> (p. 296.) That &s;uch a violent transfer of power did not pro|duce effects, as bad as tho&s;e from which it had delivered the State; and that this tumultuary &s;pirit died away, without any further con&s;equences, than elevating William to the legi|timate con&s;titutional powers of &s;upreme magi&s;trate; is to be a&s;cribed to his moderation. His &s;ub&s;equent good fortune and conduct, and that of the States, compelled Lewis XIV. to evacuate his &s;udden conque&s;ts; and procured an honourable peace. The Louve&s;tien party was for a time &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; and the Stadtholder&s;hip made hereditary to William's de&s;|cendants.</P>
<P>Upon the return of peace, that party again gathered &s;trength enough, being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the intrigues of France, to under|mine the popularity of the Prince, and dimini&s;h his intere&s;t and credit with the States; although he was &s;upported by the Pen&s;ionary of Holland. And in this &s;truggle, William, the con&s;tant victim or principal actor in revolutions, who by one had lo&s;t his hereditary dignities in his cradle, and to which he had been re&s;tored by a &s;econd; was very near being deprived of them again by a third: a danger, from which his fortune, and the fortune of this i&s;land pre&s;erved him; to effect a fourth of &s;till greater magnitude: by recovering our liberties, and placing them on a ba&s;is, which Providence &s;eems to have de&s;igned to be as permanent as our wi&s;dom, and our virtues.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="38">The cau&s;e and the progre&s;s of this convul&s;ion, which at fir&s;t threatened to replunge the Provinces into calamities, as great as tho&s;e from which they had &s;o lately emerged, were as follows. The French having renewed the troubles of Europe, by invading the Spani&s;h Netherlands, the Prince moved, in the a&s;&s;embly of the States, that an addition of 16,000 new rai&s;ed troops &s;hould be made to the army: by the articles of the union of Utrecht, &s;uch a motion can be carried by a unanimous vote only: though he had a majority upon the que&s;tion, there were &s;ome di&s;&s;enting voices: and when he found him&s;elf not able to bring over his opponents, he <Q>determined that the plurality of voices &s;hould be a &s;ufficient authority.</Q> (p. 317.) The Louve&s;tien party in general, apprehended more dreadful con&s;equences from the power of the Stadtholder, than from the arms of the French Monarch: many of the magi&s;trates of Am&s;terdam, and of the deputies, had been bribed by his re&s;ident; which was di&s;covered by his intercepted letters: and the party again&s;t the Prince was &s;o &s;trong and determined, as to protect the&s;e offenders from legal inquiry. This conduct of the oppo&s;ition was, for the pre&s;ent, of &s;ervice to William; by covering the illegality of the power he a&s;&s;umed, with &s;ome colour of that urgent nece&s;|&s;ity which di&s;pen&s;es with law. He pur&s;ued his determination; and was greatly advanced in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the levies, when an accommodation between France and Spain took place. To mortify the Prince, the&s;e troops were immediately di&s;|charged: and his enemies found them&s;elves &s;trong enough, to proceed to dive&s;t him of his dignities, and confer them upon another Prince of his hou&s;e. Prince Ca&s;imer of Na&s;&s;au was already in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the government of Frie&s;land, and Groningen: and the inhabitants of Am&s;terdam, <Q>invited him and his court to their city, with an intent to confer on him the Stadtholder&s;hip, in the room of his cou&s;in the Prince of Orange: the project was baffled by the harmony
<PB N="40" REF="39">
&s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the two Princes.</Q> (p. 321.) But the magi&s;trates determined to compen&s;ate their di&s;appointment, "by &s;ome other method of revenge," no le&s;s &s;ignal and mortifying. And by means of the Louve&s;tien party, Lewis XIV. was &s;till able to <Q>maintain the Provinces in a kind of &s;ubjection; to limit the authority of the Stadtholder, and prevent all vigorous re&s;olutions.</Q></P>
<P>But the&s;e threatening appearances pa&s;&s;ed away &s;ooner than might be expected: we are left to conjecture how they were di&s;pelled: but probably, the re&s;tle&s;s ambition of the French cabinet; the attention of James II. to his army and navy; and the declarations of his prie&s;ts, that the force of the two monarchies would again be joined again&s;t the republic, revived the popularity and influence of the Prince; and induced the States, to lend the mo&s;t cordial a&s;&s;i&s;tance to his &s;ucce&s;sful expedition into England; which &s;eated him upon the throne of the&s;e kingdoms: and it may be added, which in&s;ured to him the peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his dignities in the republic, which before &s;eemed dubious. <Q>For that party, which had &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed the Prince of Orange, re&s;igned it&s;elf intirely to the direction of the King of Great Britain: &s;uch influence had he acquired &s;ince his acce&s;&s;ion to that throne.</Q> (p. 343.)</P>
<P>But the Louve&s;tien party, or the Arminians, &s;till continued to endeavour to maintain and extend their natural foundation of power, by a diligent propagation of their religious opi|nions. And it was at the particular in&s;tance of King William, that the States of Holland and Frie&s;land publi&s;hed an edict in September, 1694; ordering all the clergy, in their &s;ermons, to preach no other doctrine than that approved by the &s;ynod of Dordrecht: <Q>to introduce no uncommon axioms, no novel opinions or doctrines in their writings; and not to examine by the light of rea&s;on, what was intended by the author of our being to exceed rea&s;on.</Q> (p. 346.)</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="40">The difference with which William treated the di&s;|&s;enters of England and Holland, is ea&s;ily explained; an enmity to France was his ruling principle: the di&s;&s;enters in Holland were blindly attached to that nation; he meant therefore, at lea&s;t, to re&s;train their increa&s;e by this edict: tho&s;e of England were actuated again&s;t it by re&s;entments equal to his own; <Q>they were willing and able to &s;erve him</Q> in his favourite views: and it was with reluctance he &s;aw him&s;elf deprived of their &s;ervices, by the operation of the te&s;t act. Whether the di&s;&s;enters in either country, were to be admitted to the &s;ame privileges as the re&s;t of the &s;ubjects, or to be refu&s;ed a toleration; depended with him upon the an&s;wer to this que&s;tion; are they enemies or friends to the French intere&s;t? It is ea&s;y to &s;ee, this is not the point upon which the que&s;tion ought to turn: but the per&s;ecutions of his youth are an apology for the errors of his judgment upon this &s;ubject: his &s;entiments however add no weight to the argument again&s;t the Te&s;t act.</P>
<P>It is at this period, that the work, which has been hitherto followed, breaks off: but it appears, from the la&s;t extract, that the religious di&s;putes were revived; and the Arminians were again gaining ground in the Provinces. And the events which followed the death of William, &s;how that the Louve&s;|tien party immediately obtained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the government, and effected a third change in its form; the office of Stadt|holder being &s;uppre&s;&s;ed a &s;econd time. In the year 1747, it was again re&s;tored in a tumultuous manner by the people; who&s;e attachment to the hou&s;e of Orange has always &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted unaltered. Under the admini&s;tration of the pre&s;ent Stadtholder, we have &s;een the Louve&s;tien party once more revive, and acquire &s;uch a degree of &s;trength, as in the year 1787, to deprive him of many of the powers annexed to his office, expel him from the Hague, and almo&s;t effect another revolution; which they manife&s;tly intended: when the inter|po&s;ition
<PB N="42" REF="41">
of Pru&s;&s;ia and Great Britain, re&s;tored the Prince to all the prerogatives of which he had been dive&s;ted.</P>
<P>This &s;ketch of the hi&s;tory of the civil commotions of Hol-Holland, comprehends a term of 178 years: in this time, four revolutions have been effected: the Stadtholder&s;hip having been twice &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by edict, and twice re&s;tored by popular in&s;urrections. Four other revolutions were upon the very point of taking place: Maurice, and his grand&s;on William, had each of them very nearly erected an ab&s;olute &s;overeignty in the Provinces: a third was very probably avoided by the moderation of Prince Ca&s;imer; who declined the invitation of the powerful city of Am&s;terdam, to &s;et up as Stadtholder again&s;t his cou&s;in William III. and the weakne&s;s of France, in the year 1787, is the probable cau&s;e why the Provinces are not, at this in&s;tant, over-run with the forces of England, France, and Pru&s;&s;ia; and ho&s;tile armies of their own inha|bitants.</P>
<P>The longe&s;t interval, during which Holland enjoyed a form of government which had the appearance of being fixed, was from the death of King William to the year 1747; or about 45 years: if we deduct from the former part of it, the time, during which jealou&s;y, di&s;quiet, and di&s;order, mu&s;t have pre|vailed, after the demolition of the old government; and from the latter, that period of inte&s;tine confu&s;ion, which mu&s;t have preceded its tumultuary re&s;toration; the middle of the term, in which &s;ome little dome&s;tic quiet may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been enjoyed, will be found to be very &s;hort.</P>
<P>From the length of time, during which the&s;e confu&s;ions &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, there is another ob&s;ervation which &s;ugge&s;ts it&s;elf to us: Holland certainly had not advanced in refinement, in liberality of ideas, and in &s;cience, le&s;s than the other States of Europe: yet nearly two centuries have elap&s;ed, &s;ince reli|gious antipathies, which afterward became clo&s;ely connected with political di&s;putes, excited the two parties again&s;t each
<PB N="43" REF="42">
other: an error in their laws put equal arms into the hands of both; and their animo&s;ities are not yet at an end. A &s;pace of time con&s;iderably le&s;s has intervened, &s;ince the di&s;&s;enters and the e&s;tabli&s;hed church of England were engaged in the mo&s;t de&s;tructive civil ho&s;tilities: and it may properly be e&s;teemed, even at this juncture, too ra&s;h to ri&s;k the &s;afety of the &s;tate upon a probability, that time has wrought greater effect on one &s;ide of the water, than on the other.</P>
<P>The con&s;titution of Holland, under the government of an hereditary Stadtholder, is effectively a &s;pecies of mixed mo|narchy: and if it be compared to that of Great Britain, they will be found to bear more re&s;emblance to each other, than either of them does to an unlimited monarchy, or pure republic. Therefore, when our inquiries are directed to the effect of adopting or abrogating any law, upon the con&s;ti|tution; as far as the propriety or impropriety of &s;uch a mea&s;ure is to be judged of from the experience of other &s;tates, the examples drawn from the hi&s;tory of Holland, are the mo&s;t conclu&s;ive. And the uniform tenor of the annals of that country, &s;ince it has acquired a &s;ettled independence, forms a connected ma&s;s of evidence of the &s;uperiority of the Engli&s;h &s;y&s;tem of eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws, relating to the e&s;tabli&s;hment, over that adopted in the United Provinces: and particularly illu&s;trates this po&s;ition; that when the inhabitants of a &s;tate are divided in their religious opinions, the executive power ought to be exclu&s;ively intru&s;ted to members of the mo&s;t numerous and powerful church.</P>
<P N="3">III. The la&s;t propo&s;ition to be treated of is, that the repeal of the te&s;t act would increa&s;e the power of the popular part of the con&s;titution; and therefore, that its continuance is nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve it in its pre&s;ent &s;tate.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="43">To what is to be brought in proof of this, I &s;hall premi&s;e one ob&s;ervation upon the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the Briti&s;h con&s;ti|tution. It is now very generally admitted, that more liberty is actually enjoyed under a mixed monarchy, than under a republic: the con&s;equence of which is, that when &s;uch a monarchy approaches to a republican form of government, nearer than by a certain di&s;tance, be that what it may, liberty it&s;elf begins to be dimini&s;hed, independent of the additional lo&s;s of &s;ecre&s;y in its councils, and celerity in their execution. Therefore, when it is in the &s;ituation de&s;cribed, to decrea&s;e the democratic power by degrees or otherwi&s;e, or to dimini&s;h that of the other two branches, is inimical to the &s;tate.</P>
<P>I pre&s;ume it may be a&s;&s;erted, that the be&s;t friends of this country concur in thinking, that our con&s;titution is arrived to that point; or &s;o near to it, that the aberration is too minute to be a&s;certained, and it cannot be determinately fixed on which &s;ide it falls.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>An advocate for the repeal of the Te&s;t act may di&s;pute this; but when he enters upon the effects of the repeal upon the con&s;titution, he mu&s;t lay it down, that it either will, or will not, alter the proportional &s;trength and balance of its con&s;tituent parts; if he maintain the negative; which is the belief of a great number of tho&s;e who &s;trongly urge that mea&s;ure, though perhaps it is only the profe&s;&s;ion of &s;ome others, his error will be &s;hown in the text. But if he admit the affirmative; he admits the te&s;t act to be the &s;upport of the civil con&s;titution, as it now exi&s;ts; and this very point being granted; it &s;eems to me requi&s;ite to add nothing more, to prove that a repeal ought not to take place: and it is pre&s;umed, that this kingdom contains but a very &s;mall party of a contrary opinion.</P></NOTE> I &s;hall therefore &s;how, in the fir&s;t place, that the tenets of the Engli&s;h di&s;&s;enters, with re&s;pect to eccle|&s;ia&s;tical polity, bia&s;s them perpetually to increa&s;e the weight of the popular part of the civil con&s;titution, and decrea&s;e that of the &s;overeign.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="44">While the government of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church is extremely analogous to the con&s;titution of the &s;tate, a circum&s;tance, per|haps of &s;ome con&s;iderable advantage to the &s;tability of the latter, the body of the di&s;&s;enters have cho&s;en to adopt a repub|lican polity: and the mode in which this influences their political opinions, is to be examined.</P>
<P>It is natural to &s;tudy with our be&s;t attention, the arguments in favour of tho&s;e opinions, which we are mo&s;t frequently obliged to defend; and again&s;t tho&s;e which we are mo&s;t frequently called upon to oppo&s;e, or &s;et our&s;elves to combat. And if a diligent application of this kind produce no change in our tenets, an event little to be expected; we naturally become more attached to them, than to tho&s;e, in defence of which we have not prepared our&s;elves with &s;o much &s;olicitude, or contended for with &s;uch vigour and per&s;everance. It is thus mo&s;t probably, that the Engli&s;h di&s;&s;enters have become &s;o firmly wedded to their republican form of church govern|ment, and their oppo&s;ition to epi&s;copacy. With what a pecu|liar degree of &s;trength they are devoted to the&s;e principles, we may judge from this &s;ingular circum&s;tance; that at the beginning of the pre&s;ent century, it was &s;ufficient to draw upon them the cen&s;ures of the Calvini&s;tic divines of the church of Charenton, who are the head of the French Pro|te&s;tants; that of the divinity profe&s;&s;or of the Dutch Univer|&s;ity of Leyden; and of the Univer&s;ity of Geneva it&s;elf; which, by a letter to that of Oxford, profe&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t unqualified di&s;approbation to their oppo&s;ition to the di&s;cipline of the church of England; which it does not appear, that the intervention of four&s;core years has at all dimini&s;hed. The con&s;equences of their particular attachment to this republican polity, de&s;erves and requires a particular con&s;i|deration, with re&s;pect to the &s;ubject before us.</P>
<P>It is well known, with what a&s;&s;iduity and diligence the peculiar doctrines of the di&s;&s;enters are in&s;tilled into the minds
<PB N="46" REF="45">
of their children, at the earlie&s;t time of life: and the atten|tion paid to inform them of all the arguments in behalf of tho&s;e points, in which they hold opinions diametrically oppo|&s;ite to the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, will naturally, as hath been ob&s;erved, form that part of their religious lectures, which will be with the greate&s;t care impre&s;&s;ed upon their minds. Now the defence of the republican &s;y&s;tem of church government, in oppo&s;ition to that of the e&s;tabli&s;hment, (which they per&s;i&s;t in, after the cen&s;ures of the great foreign Calvini&s;tic churches) is chiefly grounded upon arguments, equally applicable to the defence of a republican con&s;titution; therefore, when they grow up into men, if they be &s;incerely attached to their religious principles, every thing connected with them becomes venerable; and arguments e&s;teemed conclu&s;ive, when applied to the con&s;titution of the church, will have part of the weight of religious reverence added to them, when applied to the con&s;titution of the &s;tate: for it is ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, that a con&s;cientious man, who to-day holds a principle, in re&s;pect and approbation, as connected with his religion, and nece&s;&s;ary to the defence of it; will, when to-morrow it is applied to another &s;ubject, condemn the legitimate deductions from it, as the maxims of turbulence and licentiou&s;ne&s;s. Hence we may naturally expect to find many of the di&s;&s;enters, who will determinately follow the&s;e principles their full length: and that a great majority of their whole number will be &s;o far bia&s;&s;ed by them, as perpetually to endeavour to add new weight and power to the popular part of the government, or to dimini&s;h the efficacy of the two other branches; and yet be able to deceive them&s;elves into a belief, that they continue friends to liberty and a limited monarchy: though, in a con&s;titution &s;o well balanced as our own, any nearer ap|proach to a popular form of government, mu&s;t be inimical to both. It is upon the&s;e accounts, that we find &s;o many avowed republicans among the di&s;&s;enters; and that a very
<PB N="47" REF="46">
great majority of them are di&s;&s;atisfied; from a conception, that the people po&s;&s;e&s;s too little power, and the &s;overeign too much.</P>
<P>Let us now, in the &s;econd place, proceed to trace the con&s;equences of the political principles of the di&s;&s;enters, upon a &s;uppo&s;ition, that they may be in future &s;uffered to acquire a greater power in the &s;tate, than they now enjoy. Its effect will be proportioned to its increa&s;e; and new &s;trength will accrue to the democratical part of the con&s;titution, at the expence of the other two e&s;tates.</P>
<P>If the te&s;t act be aboli&s;hed, their power will be increa&s;ed directly; by the influence they will acquire, from being admitted into all judicial offices, and many others, and the dependance they will be able to create, by providing e&s;ta|bli&s;hments for many of the lower members of their &s;everal communions, at the expence of the &s;tate. And it is to be added, that all the power they will thus acquire, will be a deduction from that at pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the members of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church: for it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that new offices will be created for them. In this ca&s;e, the proportion of executive power, of offices and influence, which will fall into their hands, will greatly exceed that of their numbers and property: for although their numbers are &s;till much inferior to that of the national church; yet, whatever &s;hades of difference of opinion may prevail among them, they are much more united in their political plans and exertions; pur&s;ue them with much greater diligence and addre&s;s; and in all political conte&s;ts, or other competitions, with the members of the e&s;tabli&s;hment, they po&s;&s;e&s;s the advantage of a body of regular troops, acting again&s;t a numerous but undi&s;ciplined militia. The&s;e are qualities, I am not di&s;po&s;ed to blame in them, though the want of them el&s;ewhere is an object of regret. But the calumny with which tho&s;e of their
<PB N="48" REF="47">
opponents are loaded, who defend the cau&s;e of the con&s;titution with the &s;ame vigour with which it is attacked, de&s;erves a &s;evere cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>If credit be given to the accounts of the &s;trength of this party, their numbers and their proportion to the whole people, have been increa&s;ing ever &s;ince the revolution. For, to remove all apprehen&s;ions of their &s;trength, the great advo|cate for the repeal repre&s;ented them as being one-tenth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Speech of Mr. Fox on the Repeal.</NOTE> part of the people. In his argument on this &s;ubject, he certainly did not over&s;tate their proportion: but, even upon this ground, it appears, that their relative &s;trength has been &s;omething more than doubled, &s;ince the year 1689;<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><P>Report of the number of Churchmen, Di&s;&s;enters, and Papi&s;ts, in England, 1689.</P>

Hence it appears, that Dr. Prie&s;tley's a&s;&s;ertion, that it will not &s;urvive the repeal of the te&s;t act ten years, may be found to be eventually true. But if the&s;e con&s;equences do not hold, yet, their own calcu|lations being ju&s;t, the proportion of their numbers to that of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church is four times, and their relative &s;trength five times, what it was at the revolution. And, after a repeal of the act, our eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;hment, in &s;uch circum&s;tances, will be able to &s;tand its ground but a very few years.</P>
<P>But, whatever may be the accuracy of the&s;e &s;tatements, or the ju&s;tice of this elucidation of Dr. Prie&s;tley's prophecy; it appears very clearly, that a repeal of the te&s;t acts would have greatly increa&s;ed the power of the di&s;&s;enters in the &s;tate. That their religious tenets, and the political principles they have con&s;tantly held, which are in &s;trict analogy to them, would have made them throw the greater part of this newly acquired weight into the popular &s;cale, which would have de&s;troyed the pre&s;ent balance of power in the government: a government, under which the &s;tate has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted an hundred years, without convul&s;ions ari&s;ing from the attempt of any one power of which it is compo&s;ed, to u&s;urp upon the privi|leges and prerogatives of the other: or without any abu&s;e of them, enough to ju&s;tify a wi&s;h for an alteration.</P>
<P>It is alleged, that the repeal of the act will not affect the con&s;titution, either in church or &s;tate; &s;ome con&s;equences of it to the civil con&s;titution have been already con&s;idered. And in the&s;e, the church will be at lea&s;t equally involved: but it
<PB N="50" REF="49">
mu&s;t likewi&s;e be attended with dangers of another kind to our religious e&s;tabli&s;hment; the nature of which is now to be explained.</P>
<P>If the acts had been aboli&s;hed, the di&s;&s;enters would, as judges of the &s;upreme courts, and as magi&s;trates of the counties and corporations, have acquired juri&s;diction; in all ca&s;es relating to the doctrines and wor&s;hip of the church, as e&s;tabli&s;hed by &s;tatute, and in tho&s;e relating to its income: together with the patronage incident to the&s;e offices: the con&s;equences of which are to be examined.</P>
<P>It may be laid down, as one ab&s;olute and nece&s;&s;ary con|dition of the admi&s;&s;ibility of any man to a civil office, that <Q>he &s;hould not be in principle, either religious or political, inimical to the execution of any one branch of it.</Q> The effect of laws by no means depends upon their dead letter: it is &s;ometimes almo&s;t totally derived from the &s;pirit with which they are admini&s;tered: that is, from the principles of tho&s;e who carry them into execution; or at lea&s;t it is much tinctured by them. And this is more particularly true of religious laws. Long before the &s;evere &s;tatutes again&s;t Ca|tholics were abrogated, the judges favoured every eva&s;ion of them: yet this certainly did not ari&s;e from any favour they bore to the doctrines of that &s;ect. And as it cannot be imagined, that tho&s;e laws would have been more effective, if there had been &s;ome Catholic judges upon the bench; in like manner, the &s;anctions of every &s;tatute, by which the doctrine and di&s;cipline of the church of England is noW protected, will be rendered nugatory, when di&s;&s;enting judges are admitted into We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall: unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e, that they will act with more vigour to &s;uppre&s;s religious principles they approve, than their predece&s;&s;ors did again&s;t tho&s;e they condemned. Now, as by the term 'e&s;tabli&s;hment of the church,' its e&s;ta|bli&s;hment by law is meant on both &s;ides; and the repeal of the
<PB N="51" REF="50">
te&s;t act &s;trongly tends to render tho&s;e laws nugatory, it tends, in the &s;ame degree, to &s;ubvert the e&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>How the repeal would naturally affect the revenue of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, requires very little explanation. Its prin|cipal income is derived from the tithes, a tax originally granted by the &s;tate for the maintenance of the clergy. And juries being formed out of the body of the people, who&s;e intere&s;t is affected by that tax, the influence and authority of a judge, not ho&s;tile to its principle, will be frequently no more than is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, to guard again&s;t tho&s;e errors of judgment, into which an able advocate may lead them. But if he &s;hould think the &s;tipends of the clergy, the wages of propagating &s;uper&s;tition and error; or an inva&s;ion of the property of individuals, under the colour of laws, obtained in an age of darkne&s;s and ignorance, one or both of which mu&s;t be the belief of every di&s;&s;enting judge, he will not frequently think him&s;elf obliged to act again&s;t his religious principles; by removing mi&s;conceptions, which he firmly believes innocent in them&s;elves, and u&s;eful to religion, and the &s;tate: but imagine he has done his full duty, if he pa&s;&s;ively leave the jury to that bias, with which an habitual &s;entiment of general intere&s;t may influence their deci&s;ions; though in a manner, perhaps at the time unperceived by them&s;elves: a bias, again&s;t which, our excellent in&s;titution of trials by jury, in every other ca&s;e, has &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully guarded; but which, in this, perhaps admits no cure; and can only be counteracted, by the attention of the judge to anticipate its effects.</P>
<P>The&s;e exceptions likewi&s;e extend to the admi&s;&s;ion of di&s;|&s;enters into the magi&s;tracy of corporations or counties, as far as by the&s;e offices, they would gain a juri&s;diction in matters relating either to the di&s;cipline or revenue of the church: moreover, as an incident to the&s;e offices, they would likewi&s;e
<PB N="52" REF="51">
acquire a con&s;iderable eccle&s;ia&s;tical patronage; the con&s;e|quence of which de&s;erves &s;ome attention.</P>
<P>The magi&s;trates in the counties at large, have &s;ome eccle|&s;ia&s;tical benefices in their gift, but there are more belonging to particular corporations. And although the &s;tate has thought it improper to injure the freehold of the di&s;&s;enting patron, by taking from him the right of pre&s;entation; yet no new &s;ole or joint right of nomination to an office, ought to be created by law, for the purpo&s;e of being inve&s;ted in any man, who is either upon political or religious principles, inimical to the legal exerci&s;e of that office. For, in the latter ca&s;e, which is the only one treated of here; the civil and religious duty of the di&s;&s;enting magi&s;trate, are &s;et in oppo&s;ition to each other: his civil duty obliges him to give a preference to the candidate for a benefice, who he thinks will be&s;t fulfil all the purpo&s;es of the office conferred on him; one of which is, to dimini&s;h, by all proper means, the extent and influence of the magi&s;|trate's religious tenets: but his religious duty will draw him in an ab&s;olutely contrary direction.</P>
<P>Hence it appears, that it is a very difficult ta&s;k to prove, that a di&s;&s;enter can, with due regard to his moral and reli|gious obligations, take the oath required by law of every magi&s;trate. For that oath, con&s;trued without eva&s;ion, obliges him certainly to execute every function of his office, according to the true intent and meaning of the legi&s;lator. If his nomi|nation to the preferments of the church, according to that intent and meaning, be given to tho&s;e who are mo&s;t likely to draw back to the e&s;tabli&s;hment, the members of the di&s;&s;enting congregations, and, among the re&s;t, his own; he has volun|tarily accepted a &s;ituation, in which he mu&s;t betray and injure the intere&s;ts of what he e&s;teems the true religion; that is, he voluntarily determines upon occa&s;ion, &s;o to injure it. If he follow the contrary conduct, he executes an incidental function of his office, contrary to the true intent and meaning of the
<PB N="53" REF="52">
legi&s;lator: and if, which is the third and only remaining ca&s;e, he take the office, with a general determination not to act upon &s;uch occa&s;ions; this predetermined Non-fea&s;ance is contrary to the general tenor of oaths of office: which does not permit the magi&s;trate, "to let for any cau&s;e," to perform the whole functions of that office. In this ca&s;e, the oath, by which a di&s;&s;enting magi&s;trate mu&s;t bind him&s;elf to &s;ociety and the laws, is contradictory to his antecedent religious duties. He would find him&s;elf likewi&s;e under the &s;ame diffi|culties, in carrying into execution many of the laws relating to the e&s;tabli&s;hed church; and perhaps we &s;hall not advance too far, if we conclude, that any man's willingne&s;s to involve him&s;elf in &s;uch a &s;ituation, amounts to a &s;ufficient moral di&s;qualification to office.</P>
<P N="4">IV. I now come to examine the merits of &s;ome of the political arguments, which are urged in favour of the repeal of the te&s;t act: &s;electing for this review, tho&s;e only, in which a greater degree of confidence &s;eems to have been repo&s;ed by the friends of that mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is, that of the two great functions of government, legi&s;lation and the execution of laws; the former is the &s;upe|rior: and as no injury to the &s;tate re&s;ults, or has re&s;ulted, from the di&s;&s;enters po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing legi&s;lative power, in common with the members of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church; no evil can ari&s;e from &s;uffering them to enjoy a &s;hare in the executive power; a department, in its nature inferior, and of le&s;s confidence than the other.</P>
<P>This argument tacitly &s;uppo&s;es a principle, as univer&s;ally true, which no one can admit as &s;uch, when it is laid &s;imply before him: that is, that tho&s;e who are able to take the &s;upreme direction in any bu&s;ine&s;s, po&s;&s;e&s;s every qualification to carry it into execution, in all its inferior parts. But it is matter of daily experience, that the&s;e two di&s;tinct depart|ments
<PB N="54" REF="53">
may call for different qualifications: and that there may be qualities ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in the &s;ubor|dinate agent, which tho&s;e in the &s;upreme direction do not want to po&s;&s;e&s;s; and if they did, that they could not avail them&s;elves of the u&s;e of them.</P>
<P>To bring this general ob&s;ervation to the particular point before us: to the objection &s;tated above, it is an&s;wered, that the di&s;&s;enters do not po&s;&s;e&s;s the qualifications, which intitle them to have a &s;hare in the executive part of government: or in other words, that they hold principles which disqualify them therefrom. But that the&s;e principles do not render it inexpedient, to confer upon them a &s;hare of the legi&s;lative power.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t of the&s;e propo&s;itions, it may be laid down as a univer&s;al maxim, that no mea&s;ure, no &s;y&s;tem of mea&s;ures, or &s;y&s;tem of laws, will be duly carried into execution, by tho&s;e who are enemies to them upon principle, either in the whole, or in part: in which latter de&s;cription, it has been already &s;hown, that every &s;ect of the di&s;&s;enters are involved.</P>
<P>But when a law is to be made or amended, every thing which can be alleged, for or again&s;t the principle of that law or amendment, and on its &s;everal parts, ought to be heard with equal advantage. That is, when a que&s;tion is properly before an a&s;&s;embly, competent to the deci&s;ion of it, the advo|cate and opponents of it ought to be heard at the &s;ame time, that their oppo&s;ite arguments may be fairly compared; and that they &s;hould be enabled to &s;upport their principles in the &s;ame manner, that is, by vote, as well as by argument. And in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ions of this nature in our legi&s;lative a&s;&s;em|blies, tho&s;e who&s;e education bia&s;&s;es them too much to the popular part of the con&s;titution, or to reduce the dignity and power of the church; may form, in either hou&s;e, no more than a proper counterpoi&s;e to tho&s;e, who are di&s;po&s;ed to the
<PB N="55" REF="54">
oppo&s;ite uncon&s;titutional errors. Exclude either of them, and the con&s;titution will be in danger of inclining too much to the oppo&s;ite extreme. Hence, a part of the two e&s;tates of the legi&s;lature may very properly be di&s;&s;enters from the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment; although, as it has been &s;hown before, per&s;ons of that de&s;cription ought not to be intru&s;ted with executive power.</P>
<P>It is not only in debates on the principle of a law, that it is expedient not to &s;uppre&s;s oppo&s;ition of opinion; its prin|ciple may be excellent, yet, in all probability, many of its parts may be greatly improved, by the vigilance of tho&s;e who entertain very different &s;entiments of it. The perfection of the outline will frequently conceal the faults of the &s;ubor|dinate parts, from the ob&s;ervation of the &s;anguine favourers of the general tendency of a law: and they will mo&s;tly e&s;cape all detection, but that of the watchful jealou&s;y of an adver&s;e party: for it is equally the fate of improvements of legi&s;|lation, and of new di&s;coveries in every other &s;cience; to receive much of their ultimate perfection, from the objections of tho&s;e who are eager in oppo&s;ition to them.</P>
<P>There is another argument, which is very &s;trongly alleged in favour of the prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters; derived from the &s;upport they have, on different occa&s;ions, given to the con&s;titution: which is urged as a deci&s;ive proof, that they hold no prin|ciples dangerous to its &s;tability, but, on the contrary, are intitled to the total confidence of the &s;tate; and an equal &s;hare in all honours and offices, with the members of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church.</P>
<P>This is &s;uppo&s;ed to be abundantly &s;ufficient to outweigh the pre&s;umption, that an admi&s;&s;ion of their claims, would increa&s;e too much the &s;trength of the popular part of the government: it is nece&s;&s;ary, therefore, that we &s;hould be able to find in their conduct, on the occa&s;ion referred to,
<PB N="56" REF="55">
&s;ufficient ground to di&s;prove the truth of this apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>Now let the merit of their tardy concurrence to that oppo|&s;ition to James II. which produced the revolution; and their le&s;s ambiguous de&s;erts in joining chearfully with the majority of the nation, in placing the pre&s;ent royal family upon the throne, and oppo&s;ing two rebellions, be e&s;timated at any amount they may chu&s;e; it does not in the lea&s;t invalidate the objection laid down again&s;t their admi&s;&s;ibility to office: &s;uch conduct being as perfectly coincident with the di&s;quali|fying principle alleged again&s;t them, as with tho&s;e more &s;ober maxims of civil liberty, which are the guards, upon which our free government mu&s;t depend, for the effective part of its &s;upport. If the efforts of the &s;tate had been un&s;ucce&s;sful in any one of the&s;e &s;truggles, the principal weight of the blow would have fallen upon the popular part of the con&s;titution. Can their zealous defence of it at the&s;e times, be wrought up into a proof, that they do not wi&s;h its aggrandizement, at the expence of the other two? In &s;uch a national calamity, they them&s;elves would probably have been the fir&s;t victims. And is it a political merit, that, &s;tanding fir&s;t in danger, they determined to arm with their fellow citizens in &s;elf-defence? But, in their zeal for the common cau&s;e, did they not hazard them&s;elves, on one &s;ide, to the bitter and increa&s;|ing re&s;entments of the enemy? and did they not expo&s;e them&s;elves, on the other, to the rigour of the penal laws of that e&s;tabli&s;hment, who&s;e battles they fought? the an&s;wer lies in a very &s;mall compa&s;s: <Q>with an act of indemnity in their pockets.</Q> Under the joint influence of political prin|ciple and &s;elf-defence, the mo&s;t decided republican mu&s;t have acted as they did: their conduct therefore cannot be brought in proof, that their &s;entiments do not incline them too much to the popular part of the con&s;titution: and neither proof, nor &s;hadow of proof, ari&s;es from it, that it is expedient to
<PB N="57" REF="56">
take off their di&s;qualifications. Rever&s;e the ca&s;e, and it may very well be left to their own deci&s;ion. Suppo&s;e, that in any point of time, there had exi&s;ted in the kingdom, a con&s;ider|able party, de&s;irous of increa&s;ing the royal power, at the expence of that of the other two e&s;tates; &s;uch as the Catho|lics may be e&s;teemed formerly to have been; and like them, excluded from all offices by a te&s;t act: and &s;uppo&s;e an attempt to be made by a republican army to &s;ubvert the con&s;titution; that this is oppo&s;ed, its true and real &s;upporters, men, who though friends to a limited kingly government, would not lay the liberties of the nation at the foot of the throne; the part that will be taken by the monarchical faction is certain, they will join the latter: and if, by this junction, the con&s;titution is pre&s;erved, can it be &s;aid, that their principles are thus proved to be con&s;titutional, or that they are le&s;s objects of political jealou&s;y than before?</P>
<P>It is further &s;aid, that the national church &s;tands, in &s;ome degree, engaged to concur with the di&s;&s;enters in the repeal of the act: its object having been, at a time of particular dan|ger, to di&s;qualify the Catholics to hold civil offices. And, as it was not probable, that an act, directed exclu&s;ively again&s;t that &s;ect, would at that time have pa&s;&s;ed; the di&s;&s;enters &s;uffered them&s;elves to be included in it, upon an expectation, that, at a &s;ub&s;equent period, an act would be made for their relief.</P>
<P>In this account we are left to conjecture, whether their expectation was founded on a promi&s;e, made by &s;ome mem|bers of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, or not. It is mo&s;t probable, if there had been any explicit engagement, it would have been explicitly cited; for there is little doubt, but &s;ome account of it would have been pre&s;erved: if not, it amounts to no more, than that the di&s;&s;enters expected the repeal above a century ago; and therefore, they demand it now.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="57">Let us &s;uppo&s;e an engagement of this kind was entered into by a private junto of churchmen and di&s;&s;enters: if we pa&s;s by the pre&s;umption of a few unauthori&s;ed individuals, clande&s;tinely giving and receiving an engagement, by which, the determinations of the legi&s;lature were undertaken for: it bound tho&s;e who were pledged, to exert them&s;elves to the utmo&s;t, to carry it into effect: but it could not bind the legi&s;|lative bodies, who were not parties to the agreement: and, if it had, the obligation would have been di&s;&s;olved with the parliament; it could not bind parliaments not then in being; who, if they found the law unrepealed, and judged it to be good, were in duty obliged to continue it; and, even if it had been repealed before the date of their exi&s;tence, to have reenacted it.</P>
<P>The te&s;t act, like all other laws, mu&s;t &s;tand and fall by its own merit; and not upon that of the conduct and de&s;igns of its original framers; their motives, or the mode in which it was brought forward. Our law books contain &s;ome excellent &s;tatutes, for which the fir&s;t authors are intitled to very little prai&s;e. The animo&s;ity of the long parliament again&s;t the Dutch, was their principal motive to pa&s;s the navigation act: a motive at lea&s;t impolitic; but the act it&s;elf is one of the be&s;t that exi&s;ts, in the European codes of mercantile laws. The habeas corpus act &s;tands as high, among tho&s;e laws which &s;ecure the liberties of the &s;ubject: James II. who&s;e infor|mation was probably better than that of any private hi&s;torian, informs us, that it was projected by Lord Shafte&s;bury, when, being engaged in the pro&s;ecution of his &s;editious mea&s;ures, he was apprehen&s;ive of being impri&s;oned, by the di&s;cretionary power the King then exerci&s;ed. The impolitic animo&s;ity, which dictated one law, and the trea&s;onable motives of the other, will not be thought a &s;ufficient argument for their repeal: and the like may be &s;aid of the te&s;t act, if it were improperly obtained.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="58">The di&s;&s;enters further contend, that their exclu&s;ion from office by the religious te&s;t laws, is a deprivation of their natural rights, as men; to which they ought to be re&s;tored, by their being repealed.</P>
<P>This argument &s;eems not only erroneous, but to contain an error of a very particular kind. In its terms, it appears to be an appeal to the principles of freedom and natural equality; but, when it comes to be con&s;idered, it will be found to re&s;t upon a principle, repugnant to the fir&s;t great canon of civil liberty; and which has always been revered by them, as a principle of the highe&s;t importance.</P>
<P>Rights may be divided into two cla&s;&s;es, natural and con|ventional. The latter are acquired by compact only; and have no exi&s;tence previous to the compact, but &s;olely in con&s;equence of it. The right to the powers of magi&s;tracy, is founded on a compact between the magi&s;trate and the people, or the majority of the people; and the right cannot exi&s;t prior to the contract. And no man is eligible, or can hold &s;uch an office, only by &s;uch a contract <HI>de facto,</HI> or the &s;uppo&s;ition of the exi&s;tence of &s;uch a contract: but no &s;uch &s;uppo&s;ition can be admitted, where the law (the voice of the people) declares it not to exi&s;t. This is the foundation of all freedom in civil government; the ba&s;is on which all authority, from that of the lowe&s;t officer in the &s;tate, to that of the &s;upreme magi&s;trate, is mediately or immediately founded. And when the people have de|clared, by the voices of per&s;ons properly authori&s;ed by them, that they will not enter into &s;uch compacts, with per&s;ons of a certain de&s;cription, (an act, which, it will not be di&s;puted, but they are fully competent to) they can be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of no right to office, without a contra|diction to the&s;e principles: and, as there exi&s;ts no natural right to a civil office, the di&s;&s;enters cannot &s;ay that by the te&s;t act they are deprived of &s;uch rights.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="59">The la&s;t of the arguments urged by the di&s;&s;enters which I &s;hall con&s;ider, is founded upon the &s;ame principles with the former: that to be di&s;qualified from holding an office is pe|nal; and the penalty inflicted by law, upon &s;ome of the greate&s;t offenders again&s;t &s;ociety. And, that all penalties upon account of religion, are but &s;o many modifications of ab&s;olute per&s;ecution. The preten&s;ions of this argument to weight and validity are very minute indeed. The bare non-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any de&s;ireable thing cannot be con&s;idered as pe|nal: to make it &s;o there mu&s;t have exi&s;ted &s;ome antecedent right to the thing; now the rights of per&s;ons, are either natu|ral or founded on compact: a natural right to a civil office cannot exi&s;t, the right mu&s;t be founded on compact; and no claim to a right by compact can be &s;et up, while the te&s;ti|mony of the &s;ociety to the non exi&s;tence of &s;uch contract, &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in the letter of the law: or, which is the &s;ame thing, when it is denied by the voice of the people, &s;peaking in their political capacity: and when &s;uch a que&s;tion ari&s;es <Q>it mu&s;t be decided by the voice of the &s;ociety it&s;elf: there is not upon earth any other tribunal to re&s;ort to.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Black&s;tone e&s;tabli&s;hes the right of the people as exerci&s;ed in deter|mining the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the throne, from the abdication of James to the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of the hou&s;e of Hanover upon the following principle, <Q>whenever a que&s;tion ari&s;es between the &s;ociety at large, and any magi&s;trate inve&s;ted with powers originally delegated by that &s;ociety, it mu&s;t be decided by the voice of the &s;ociety it&s;elf: there is not upon earth any other tribunal to re&s;ort to.</Q> Black. com. 8vo. 1773, v. 1, p. 211.</P></NOTE> The di&s;&s;enters therefore are dive&s;ted of no right, and no actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, by not being eligible to office, it is therefore no penal infliction or penalty.</P>
<P>I conclude this e&s;&s;ay, by an ob&s;ervation on the two la&s;t ar|guments in favour of the repeal, here con&s;idered: upon a &s;uppo&s;ition that there exi&s;ts a right in the &s;tate, to e&s;tabli&s;h
<PB N="61" REF="60">
the religion of the majority of its members by law (and the body of the di&s;&s;enters have not thought it proper to ground their application again&s;t the te&s;t acts, upon a denial of this a&s;&s;umption) the&s;e ab&s;tract doctrines of the rights of individuals, will a&s;&s;i&s;t us in proving the direct contrary of the principle, they were brought to &s;upport and furni&s;h us with a new argu|ment, that it is the duty of all legi&s;lators to guard an e&s;ta|bli&s;hed religion by a te&s;t law.</P>
<P>For it mu&s;t be admitted to be the duty of the legi&s;lature, to enact every regulation, which is expedient for the due and entire execution of the laws; which does not violate the rights of individuals; that is, their natural or conventional rights. But it is expedient, in order to en&s;ure that due execution, to exclude every cla&s;s of men from a &s;hare of the executive power, who&s;e principles, religious or civil, are ini|mical to the whole or any part of the laws which are entru&s;t|ed to their execution; while any other per&s;ons are to be found, again&s;t whom &s;uch a material objection does not lie. Now this does not violate any natural or conventional right, as hath been &s;hown above: It is therefore the duty of the legi&s;lature to e&s;tabli&s;h that principle by a po&s;itive law: and the di&s;&s;enters, being by their religious principles inimi|cal to that great branch of the laws, which e&s;tabli&s;hes the national church, they ought to be excluded from the magi&s;|tracy by law.</P>
