<HEAD>PREFACE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Rights of Infants was wrote in the latter end of the year 1796, but Paine's Agrarian Ju&s;tice coming to hand before it was pub|li&s;hed, the following Strictures, by way of Preface and Appendix, were added.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>AT la&s;t Mr. Paine has thought fit to own, with the P&s;almi&s;t, and with Mr. Locke, that <Q><HI>God hath given the earth to the children of men, given it to mankind in common</HI></Q></P>
<P>This is a truth &s;o indi&s;putable, and which I always thought of &s;uch va&s;t importance for mankind univer&s;ally to under&s;tand and acknow|ledge, that I have indefatigably embraced every opportunity, from my youth up, to publi&s;h it, together with the mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent plan that I could form thereon.</P>
<P>I am glad that Mr. Paine has, even though late, made this acknow|ledgement, becau&s;e his celebrity will procure him many readers, and greatly add both to the inve&s;tigation of this great fundamental truth, and of &s;uch philo&s;ophical &s;uper&s;tructures as may be built on the &s;ame. But as to the plan that lie has laid down in his AGRARIAN JUSTICE (where he fir&s;t acknowledges this principle) it does not appear to me to be in any mea&s;ure ju&s;t or &s;atisfactory. The principle is without doubt incomparably grand, and the very fir&s;t maxim in the law of nature, and in the &s;cience of right and wrong, and is fraught with all the ble&s;&s;ings that can render mankind happy on earth. But, O dire di&s;appointment! Behold! Mr. Paine, in&s;tead of erecting on this rock of ages an everla&s;ting Temple of Ju&s;tice, has erected an execrable fabric of compromi&s;&s;ory expediency, as if in good earne&s;t intended for a Swini&s;h Multitude.</P>
<P>The poor, beggarly &s;lipends which he would have us to accept of in lieu of our lordly and ju&s;t preten&s;ions to the &s;oil of our birth, are &s;o contemptible and in&s;ulting, that I &s;hall leave them to the &s;corn of every per&s;on con&s;cious of the dignity of his nature, not detaining the reader from the peru&s;al of the following little tract on the Rights of Infants, where men who dare contemplate their rights, may &s;ee them pourtrayed boldly at full length.</P>
<P>The more I contemplate human affairs, the more I am convinced that a landed intere&s;t is incompatible with the happine&s;s and indepen|dence of the world. For as all the rivers run into the &s;ea, and yet the &s;ea is not full, &s;o let there be ever &s;o many &s;ources of wealth, let trade, foreign and dome&s;tic, open all their fluices, yet will no other but the landed intere&s;t he ultimately the better.</P>
<P>In whatever line of bu&s;ine&s;s, or in whatever &s;ituation the public ob&s;erve men thrive, thither every one pre&s;&s;es, and in competition bid over each other's head for the hou&s;es and &s;hops on the lucky &s;po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,
<PB N="4" REF="4">thereby rai&s;ing the rents till the landlord gets the whole fat of their labours. It is the &s;ame in re&s;pect to the farms; for if a profitable market, foreign or dome&s;tic, &s;pring up for the produce of the earth, then farming will be the rage, and every one will over bid another for farms, till they can hardly live by them. Nay, even aboli&s;h the tythes, and the rents of the farms will immediately &s;o advance that the whole advantage &s;hall center in the landlords.</P>
<P>Thus all things work togethe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for good to tho&s;e who love God, which &s;eems to be fully accompli&s;hed in the landed intere&s;t, who are the vi&s;ible elect. Yes, for theirs are all things whether the &s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, the government or the dignities; the principalities, or the powers. All dominion is rooted and grounded in land, and thence &s;pring every kind of lord&s;hip which overtops and choaks all the &s;hrubs and flowers of the fore&s;t. But take away tho&s;e tall, tho&s;e overbearing ariflocratic trees, and then the lowly plants of the &s;oil will have air, will thrive and grow robu&s;t. Neverthele&s;s, take care you leave not any roots of tho&s;e lordly plants in the earth, for though cut down to the &s;lump like Nebuchaduezzar, yet if any ve&s;tage of the &s;y&s;tem remain, any fibre of the accur&s;ed roots, though ever &s;o &s;mall lie concealed in the &s;oil, they would &s;prout again and &s;oon recover their pri&s;tine vigour, to the over&s;hadowing and de&s;truction of all the undergrowth. Thus do philo&s;ophy and the pure&s;t philanthropy compel us to cradicate this baneful order from human &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Whether my plan of enjoying man's rights, which I have been publi&s;hing in different ways for more than twenty years, be objecti|onable or no, it is certain it has never been an&s;wered; neither have I &s;een or heard of any arguments on the &s;ubject, but what have only more effectually convinced me that no &s;y&s;tem can be more univer&s;ally ju&s;t even to tho&s;e it &s;eems mo&s;t to militate again&s;t; more ea&s;ily e&s;tab|li&s;hed, becau&s;e it is the intere&s;t of every one not to oppo&s;e it; nor of cour&s;e more likely afterwards to be more peaceful and permanent.</P>
<P>If I am wrong, let me be confuted; and if I am not, let mankind for their own &s;akes, pay attention to what I &s;ay. They ought at lea&s;t to give me credit for my di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s in this &s;cheme, for according to it I can have no private landed e&s;tate, no tenants to work for me, nor claim any privilege above my fellow-citizens. Wherefore, before any be &s;o ungenerous as to condemn me as pre&s;umptuous, I hope they will candidly weigh my &s;everal arguments which they will find in the various little things I have publi&s;hed, which are neither many nor dear, and in the following Rights of Infants.</P>

<SPEAKER>Woman.</SPEAKER>
<P>A&s;k the &s;he-bears, and every &s;he-mon&s;ter, and they will tell you what the rights of every &s;pecies of young are.&mdash;They will tell you, in re&s;olute language and actions too, that their rights extend to a full participation of the fruits of the earth. They will tell you, and vindicate it likewi&s;e by deeds, that mothers have a right, at the peril of all oppo&s;ers, to provide from the elements the proper nour|i&s;hments of their young. And &s;eeing this, &s;hall we be a&s;ked what the Rights of Infants are? As if they had no rights? As if they were excre&s;cences and abortions of nature? As if they had not a right to the milk of our brea&s;ts? Nor we a right to any food to make milk of? As if they had not a right to good nur&s;ing, to cleanline&s;s, to com|fortable cloathing and lodging? Villains! Why do you a&s;k that ag|gravating que&s;tion? Have not the &s;oxes holes, and the birds of the air ne&s;ts, and &s;hall the children of men have not where to lay their heads? Have brute-mothers a right to eat gra&s;s, and the food they like be&s;t, to engender milk in their dugs, for the nouri&s;hment of their young, and &s;hall the mothers of infants be denied &s;uch a right? Is not this earth our common al&s;o, as well as it is the common of brutes? May we not eat herbs, berries, or nuts as well as other creatures? Have we not a right to hunt and prowl for prey with &s;he-wolves? And have we not a right to fi&s;h with &s;he-otters? Or may we not dig coals or cut wood for fuel? Nay, does nature provide a luxuriant and abun|dant fea&s;t for all her numerous tribes of animals except us? As if &s;orrow were our portion alone, and as if we and our helple&s;s babes came into this world only to weep over each other?</P>

<SPEAKER>Woman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Molochs! Our &s;ex were defenders of rights from the beginning. And though men, like other he-brutes, &s;ink calmly into apathy re&s;pecting their offspring, you &s;hall find nature, as it never was, &s;o it never &s;hall be extingui&s;hed in us. You &s;hall find that we not only know our rights, but have &s;pirit to a&s;&s;ert them, to the downfal of you and all tyrants. And &s;ince it is &s;o that the men, like he-a&s;&s;es, &s;uffer them&s;elves to be laden with as many pair of panyers of rents, tithes, &amp;c. as your <HI>tender</HI> con&s;ciences plea&s;e to lay upon them, we, even we, the females, will vindicate the rights of the &s;pecies, and throw you and all your panyers in the dirt.</P>

<P>So you wi&s;h to turn the cultivated world into a wilder|ne&s;s, that you may eat wild fruits and game like Indians?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woman.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sophi&s;ts, we do not want to be as Indians. But the natural fruits of the earth being the fruits of our undoubted common, we have an indefen&s;ible right to, and we will no longer be deprived of them, without an equivalent.</P>

<SPEAKER>Ari&s;tocracy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you not, in lieu of tho&s;e wild productions, get bread, and mutton, and beef, and garden &s;tuff, and all the refined productions and luxuries of art and labour; what rea&s;on then have you to complain?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are you &s;erious? Would you really per&s;uade us that we have no rea&s;on to complain? Would you make us believe that we receive the&s;e productions of art and culture as a fair compen&s;ation for the natural produce of our common, which you deprive us of? Have we not to purcha&s;e the&s;e things before we enjoy them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ari&s;tocracy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sure, woman, you do not expect the fruits of men's labours and ingenuity for nothing! Do not the farmers, in the fir&s;t place, pay very high rents for their farms; and, in the next place, are they not at great trouble and expence in tilling and manuring the ground, and in breeding cattle; and &s;urely you cannot expect that there men will work and toil, and lay out their money for you, for nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woman.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, ladies and gentlemen, who ever dreamt of hurting the farmers, or taking their provi&s;ions for nothing, except your&s;elves? It is only the privileged orders, and their humble imi|tators on the highway, who have the impudence to deprive men of their labours for nothing. No; if it plea&s;e your noblene&s;&s;es and gentlene&s;&s;es, it is you, and not the farmers, that we have to reckon with. And pray now, your highne&s;&s;es, who is it that receive tho&s;e rents which you &s;peak of from the farmers?</P>

<P>We, to be &s;ure; we receive the rents.</P>

<P>Woman! Our fathers either &s;ought for or purcha&s;ed our e&s;tates.</P>

<SPEAKER>Woman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well confe&s;&s;ed, villains! Now out of your own mouths will I condemn you, you wicked Molocks! And &s;o you have the im|pudence
<PB N="7" REF="7">to own your&s;elves the cur&s;ed brood of ru&s;&s;ians, who by &s;laugh|ter and oppre&s;&s;ion, u&s;urped the lord&s;hip and dominion of the earth, to the exclu&s;ion and &s;tarvation of weeping infants and their poor mo|thers? Or, at the be&s;t, the purcha&s;ers of tho&s;e ill-got domains? O wor&s;e than Molochs! now let the blood of the millions of innocent babes who have peri&s;hed through your vile u&s;urpations be upon your murderous heads! You have deprived the mothers of nature's gifts, and farmed them out to farmers, and pocketied the money, as you audaciou&s;ly confe&s;s. Yes, villains! you have trea&s;ured up the tears and groans of dumb, helple&s;s, peri&s;hing, dying infants. O, you bloody landed intere&s;t! you band of robbers! Why do you call your|&s;elves ladies and gentlemen? Why do you a&s;&s;ume &s;oft names, you bea&s;ts of prey? Too well do your emblazoned arms and e&s;cutcheons witne&s;s the ferocity of your bloody and barbarous origin! But &s;oon &s;hall tho&s;e audacious Gothic emblems of rapine cea&s;e to offend the eyes of an enlightened people, and no more make an odious di&s;tinc|tion between the &s;poilers and the &s;poiled. But, ladies and gentlemen, is it nece&s;&s;ary, in order that we eat bread and mutton; that the rents &s;hould be received by you? Might not the farmers as well pay their rents to us, who are the natural and rightful proprietors? If, for the &s;ake of cultivation, we are content to give up to farmers our wild fruits, our hunting grounds, our fi&s;h and game; our coal-mines, and our fo|re&s;ts, is it not equitable that we &s;hould have the rents in lieu thereof? If not, how can the farmers have the face to &s;ell us again the produce of our own land?</P>
<P>Hear me! ye oppre&s;&s;ors! ye who live &s;umptuou&s;ly every day! ye, for whom the &s;un &s;eems to &s;hine, and the &s;ea&s;ons change, ye for whom alone all human and brute creatures toil, &s;ighing, but in vain, for the crumbs which fall from your overcharged tables; ye, for whom alone the heavens drop fatne&s;s, and the earth yields her encrea&s;e; hearken to me, I &s;ay, ye who are not &s;atisfied with u&s;urping all that nature can yield; ye, who are in&s;atiable as the grave; ye who would deprive every heart of joy but your own, I &s;ay hearken to me! Your horrid tyranny, your infanticide is at an end! Your grinding the faces of the poor, and your drinking the blood of infants, is at an end! The groans of the pri&s;ons, the groans of the camp, and the groans of the cottage, excited by your infernal policy, are at an end! And behold the whole earth breaks forth into &s;inging at the new creation, at the breaking of the iron rod of ari&s;tocratic &s;way, and at the ri&s;ing of the everla&s;ting &s;un of righteou&s;ne&s;s!</P>
<P>And did you really think, my good gentlefolk, that you were the pillars that upheld the univer&s;e? Did you think that we would never have the wit to do without you? Did you conceive that we &s;hould never be able to procure bread and beef, and fuel, without your agency? Ah! my dear creatures, the magic &s;pell is broke. Your &s;orceries, your witchcrafts, your prie&s;tcrafts, and all your juggling crafts, are at an end; and the Meridian Sun of Liberty bur&s;ts forth upon the a&s;to|ni&s;hed
<PB N="8" REF="8">world, di&s;pelling the accumulated mi&s;ts of dreary ages, and leaves us the glorious blue expan&s;e, of &s;erene unclouded rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Well then, &s;ince you have compelled, &s;ince you have driven us, through your cruel bondage, to emancipate our&s;elves, we will even try to do without you, and deal with the hone&s;t farmers our&s;elves, who will find no difference, unle&s;s for the better, between paying their rents to us and to you.</P>
<P>And whereas we have found our hu&s;bands, to their indelible &s;hame, woefully negligent and deficient about their own rights, as well as tho&s;e of their wives and infants, we women, mean to take up the bu&s;ine&s;s our&s;elves, and let us &s;ee if any of our hu&s;bands dare hinder us. Wherefore, you will find the bu&s;ine&s;s much more &s;eriou&s;ly and effectually managed in our hands than over it has been yet. You may &s;mile, tyrants, but you have ju&s;ter cau&s;e to weep. For, as nature has implanted into the brea&s;ts of all mothers the mo&s;t pure and une|quivocal concern for their young, which no bribes can buy, nor threats annihilate, be a&s;&s;ured we will &s;tand true to the intere&s;t of our babes, and &s;hame, woe, and de&s;truction be to the pitiful varlet that dare ob&s;truct us. For their &s;akes we will no longer make brick without &s;traw, but will draw the produce of our e&s;tate. If we deprive our|&s;elves of our common, in order that it may be cultivated, we our|&s;elves will have the price thereof, that we may buy therewith, as far as it will go, the farmer's produce. And &s;o far as our re&s;pective &s;hares of the rent may be inadequate to the comfortable and elegant &s;upport of our&s;elves and infants, &s;o far will we chearfully, by our hone&s;t endeavours, in our &s;everal callings, make up the deficiency, and tender life worth enjoying. To labour for our&s;elves and infants we do not decline; but we are &s;ick of labouring for an in&s;atiable ari&s;tocracy.</P>
<P>To convince your highne&s;&s;es that our plan is well dige&s;ted, I will lay it before you. You will find it very &s;imple, but that is the &s;ign of the greater perfection. As I &s;aid before, we women (becau&s;e the men are not to be depended on) will appoint, in every pari&s;h, a com|mittee of our own &s;ex, (which we pre&s;ume our gallant lock-jawed &s;pou&s;es and paramours will at lea&s;t, for their own intere&s;t, not oppo&s;e,) to receive the rents of the hou&s;es and lands already tenanted, and al&s;o to let, to the be&s;t bidders, on &s;even years lea&s;es, &s;uch farms and tene|ments as may, from time to time, become vacant. Out of tho&s;e rents we can remit to government &s;o much per pound, according to the exigencies of the &s;tate, in lieu of all taxes; &s;o that we may no longer have taxes nor tax-gatherers. Out of the&s;e rents we &s;hall rent pay all our builders and workmen that build or repair our hou&s;es; pave, clean&s;e, or light our &s;treets; pay the &s;alaries of our magi&s;trates an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> other public officers. And all this we women &s;hall do quarterly, without a bank or bank-noter, in ready money, when the rents are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in; that &s;uffering neither &s;tate nor pari&s;h to run in debt. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to the overplus, after <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll public expences are defrayed, we &s;hall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> it farly and equally among all the living &s;ouls in the pari&s;h, whether male or female; married or &s;ingle; legitimate or ill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mate; from a day old to the extreme&s;t age; making no di&s;tinc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">on
<PB N="9" REF="9">between the families of rich farmers and merchants, who pay much rent for their exten&s;ive farms or premi&s;es, and the families of poor labourers and mechanics, who pay but little for their &s;mall apartments, cottages and gardens, but giving to the head of every family a full and equal &s;hare for every name under his roof.</P>
<P>And whereas births and funerals, and con&s;equent &s;ickne&s;&s;es, are attended with expence, it &s;eems requi&s;ite to allow, at quarter-day, to the head of every family, a full &s;hare for every child that may have been born in his hou&s;e &s;ince the former quarter-day, though the in|fant may be then but a day old; and al&s;o, for every per&s;on who may have died &s;ince the former quarter-day, though the death &s;hould have happened but a day after it.</P>
<P>This &s;urplus, which is to be dealt out again among the living &s;ouls in a pari&s;h every quarter-day, may be rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed to amount to full two-thirds of the whole &s;um of rents collected. But whatever it may amount to, &s;uch &s;hare of the &s;urplus rents is the impre&s;criptible right of every human being in civilized &s;ociety, as an equivalent for the natural materials of their common e&s;tate, which by letting to rent, for the &s;ake of cultivation and improvement, they are de|prived of.</P>
<P>Wherefore, now ladies and gentlemen, you &s;ee the glorious work is done! and the rights of the human &s;pecies built on &s;o broad and &s;olid a ba&s;is, that all your malice will not be able to prevail again&s;t them! Moreover, when we begin with you, we will make a full end of your power at once. We will not impoliticly tamper with the lion, and pluck out a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ooth now and then, as &s;ome propo&s;e to melt down your &s;trength by degrees, which would only irritate you to oppo&s;e us with all the power you had remaining. No; we will begin where we mean to end, by depriving you in&s;tantaneou&s;ly, as by an elective &s;hock, of every &s;pecies of revenue from lands, which will univer&s;ally and at once, be given to the pari&s;hes, to be di&s;po&s;ed of by and for the u&s;e of the inhabitants, as &s;aid before.</P>
<P>But yet be not ca&s;t down, my good ladies and gentlemen, all this is done for the &s;ake of &s;y&s;tem, not revenge or retaliation; for we wi&s;h not to reduce you to beggary, as you do us, for we will leave you all your moveable riches and wealth, all your gold and &s;ilver, your rich clothes and furniture; your corn and cattle, and every thing that does not appertain to the land as a fixture, for the&s;e, you know, mu&s;t come to the pari&s;h with our e&s;tates.

It will therefore be your intere&s;t and wi&s;dom to &s;ubmit peaceably, and fraternize chear|fully with us as fellow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.

So prepare your&s;elves peaceably to acquie&s;ce in the new &s;y&s;tem of things, which is fa&s;t approaching. And when you &s;hall hear of the ble&s;&s;ed decree being pa&s;&s;ed by the people, that the laud is from that day forth parochial property, join chorus with your glad fellow-creatures, and joyfully partake in the univer&s;al happine&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>BUT &s;top, don't let us reckon without our ho&s;t; for Mr. Paine will object to &s;uch and equal di&s;tribution of the rents. For &s;ays he, in his Agrarian Ju&s;tice, the public can claim but a <HI>Tentk Part</HI> of the value of the landed property as it now exi&s;ts, with its va&s;t improve|ments of cultivation and building. But why are we to be put off now with but a Tenth Share? Becau&s;e, &s;ays Mr. Paine, it has &s;o im|proved in the hands of private proprietors as to be of ten times the value it was of in its natural &s;tate. But may we not a&s;k who improved the land? Did the proprietors alone work and toll at this improve|ment? And did we labourers and our forefathers &s;tand, like Indians and Hottentots, idle, &s;pectators of &s;o much public-&s;pirited indu&s;try? I &s;uppo&s;e not. Nay, on the contrary, it is evident to the mo&s;t &s;uper|ficial enquirer that the labouring cla&s;&s;es ought principally to be thanked for every improvement.</P>
<P>Indeed, if there had never any &s;lave, any va&s;&s;als, or any day|labourers employed in building and tillage, then the proprietors might have boa&s;ted of having them&s;elves created all this gay &s;cene of things. But the ca&s;e alters amazingly, when we con&s;ider that the earth has
<PB N="16" REF="16">been cultivated either by &s;laves, compelled, like bea&s;ts, to labour, of by the indigent objects whom they fir&s;t exclude from a &s;hare in the &s;oil, that want may compel them to &s;ell their labour for daily bread. In &s;hort, the great may as well boa&s;t of fighting their battles as of cultivating the earth.</P>
<P>The toil of the labouring cla&s;&s;es fir&s;t produces provi&s;ions, and they the demand of their families creates a market for them. Therefore it will be found that it is the markets made by the labouring and me|chanical tribes that have improved the earth. And once take away the&s;e markets, order all the labouring people, like the I&s;raelites, leave the country in a body, and you would immediately &s;ee from what cau&s;e the country had been cultivated, and &s;o many goodly towns and villages built.</P>
<P>You may &s;uppo&s;e that after the emigration of all the&s;e beggarly people, every thing would go on as well as before: that the farmer would continue to plough, and the town landlord to build as formerly. I tell you nay; for the farmer could neither proceed without labourers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d purcha&s;ers for his corn and cattle. It would be ju&s;t the &s;ame with the building landlord, for he could neither procure workmen to build, nor tenants to pay him rent.</P>
<P>Behold then your grand, voluptuous nobility and gentry, the arch cultivators of the earth, obliged, for lack of &s;ervants, again to turn Gothic hunters, like their lavage forefathers. Behold their palaces. temples, and towns, mouldering into du&s;t, and affording &s;helter only to wild bea&s;ts; and their boa&s;ted, cultivated fields and garden, dege|nerated into a howling wilderne&s;s.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee that the con&s;umption created by the mouths, and the backs, of the poor de&s;pi&s;ed multitude, contributes to the cultivation of the earth, as well as their hands. And it is al&s;o the rents that they pay that builds the towns, and not the racking building landlord. Therefore, let us not in weak commi&s;eration be bia&s;&s;ed by the pre|tended philanthropy of the great, to the re&s;ignation of our deare&s;t rights. And if our e&s;tates have improved in their hands, during their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fficious guardian&s;hip, the D&mdash;v&mdash;I thank them; for it was done for their own &s;akes, not for cuts, and can be no ju&s;t bar again&s;t us re|covering our rights.</P>
