<HEAD>EXTRACT OF A LETTER, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>A Remark, which I made many years ago, re&s;pecting the <HI>illegality</HI> of taking up <HI>Slaves that had e&s;caped from their ma&s;ters,</HI> had been u&s;eful (I was informed) to &s;ome friends of humanity in America, in their endeavours to protect tho&s;e poor oppre&s;&s;ed people. I cannot now find a copy of that paper, but the argument was chiefly built on a reference to a text in Deut. ch. xxiii. v. 15, 16.&mdash; <Q><HI>Thou &s;halt not deliver unto his ma&s;ter the &s;ervant which is e&s;caped from his ma&s;ter unto thee: He &s;hall dwell with thee, even among you, in the place</HI> WHICH HE SHALL CHOOSE</Q> (manife&s;tly <HI>as
<PB N="4" REF="3">a freeman</HI>) <Q><HI>in one of thy</HI> GATES <HI>where</HI> IT LIKETH HIM BEST: <HI>thou &s;halt not oppre&s;s him.</HI></Q> This, I ob&s;erved, was no part of the abrogated <HI>ceremonial</HI> law of the Jews; but, manife&s;tly, a <HI>moral law,</HI> becau&s;e the rea&s;on of it &s;till remains:-&s;o that it mu&s;t be of indi&s;pen&s;ible obligation as long as the hateful <HI>oppre&s;&s;ions</HI> of Slave-holders afford us any occa&s;ions of exerci&s;ing this <HI>duty</HI> to <HI>God</HI> of <HI>pro|tecting the Slaves that e&s;cape from their ma&s;ters;</HI> and con&s;equently I a&s;&s;erted that any <HI>colonial law,</HI> which oppo&s;es this <HI>ordinance of God,</HI> by ordering the arre&s;ting and delivering up runaway Slaves, or which, in any way, tends to deprive them of due legal protection, is, of cour&s;e, to be deemed a <HI>corruption, null</HI> and <HI>void</HI> in it&s;elf, as being contrary to the &s;econd foundation of Engli&s;h law. This nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence I urged from a well known <HI>maxim</HI> of the Engli&s;h law re&s;pecting <HI>Statutes,</HI> (acts of A&s;&s;embly, or acts of Parliament) <Q><HI>nec contra</HI> RATIONEM, <HI>nec contra</HI> LEGEM DIVINAM" <HI>(&s;tatuta) exi&s;tunt.</HI></Q> (Doct. et Stud. c. 10. p. 35. b.) &mdash;That <Q><HI>Statutes exi&s;t not again&s;t</HI> REASON, nor again&s;t the DIVINE LAW," and that <HI>"an unju&s;t law</HI> is NOT LAW.</Q> <HI>"Lex inju&s;ta non e&s;t lex."</HI> Prin. Leg. et Aequit.) And again, that <Q><HI>the&s;e two laws,</HI></Q> (viz. the Law of Rea&s;on, and the Law Divine) <HI>"cannot abate, or turn a&s;ide"</HI>&mdash; <Q>Hae duae Leges declinari non po&s;&s;unt.</Q> Doct. et Stud. c. 17. p. 52.</P>
<P>But I have &s;ince had occa&s;ion to regard the&s;e two fundamental laws of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, with &s;till more awful attention; and therefore I mu&s;t farther remark, that the fir&s;t foundation, <HI>the law of</HI> REASON, (as including all the <HI>laws of na|ture,
<PB N="5" REF="4">ju&s;tice, and natural right</HI>) is certainly to be deemed <HI>the law of God,</HI> as well as the <HI>&s;econd foun|dation</HI> (the divine precepts in the Holy Scriptures), becau&s;e the former is defined by high legal autho|rity, to be <HI>"the law written upon the heart of man,"</HI> (and of cour&s;e is the law of nature) which <HI>cannot</HI> <Q><HI>therefore be obliterated, nor changed by time or place, but ought every where,</HI> and among <HI>all men,</HI> to <HI>be maintained, becau&s;e</HI> THE LAWS OF NATURE ARE IMMUTABLE"&mdash;"<HI>Lex rationis in corde &s;cribitur,</HI> ideo deleri non pote&s;t, nec etiam recipit mutationem ex loco nec tempore, &s;ed ubique, et inter omnes homines &s;ervari debet. Nam JURA NATURALIA IMMUTABILIA SUNT. Et ratio immutationis e&s;t quod recipiunt naturam rei pro fundamento, quae &s;emper eadem e&s;t et ubique.</Q> (Doct. et Stud. c. 2. p. 5.) This amply demon|&s;trates the propriety of declaring <HI>the law of Rea&s;on</HI> to be the <HI>fir&s;t foundation</HI> of Engli&s;h law; as being <HI>"the law of God, written"</HI> (as it were) <Q><HI>on the heart of man</HI></Q>&mdash;It is that <Q><HI>knowledge of good and evil</HI> in man,</Q> which may fairly be deemed a participation of <HI>"the Divine Wi&s;dom,"</HI> or of Chri&s;t him&s;elf, that <Q><HI>true light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</HI></Q> (John i. 9.) and of cour&s;e renders every man obnoxious, through the knowledge of right and law, to the divine vengeance for di&s;obedience! Our fir&s;t pa|rents <HI>wilfully</HI> a&s;&s;umed this knowledge, contrary to an expre&s;s command of their Creator, (being de|luded by the &s;piritual enemy) and thereby entailed <HI>death</HI> and <HI>condemnation</HI> on all their po&s;terity, laying them under an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity to obtain <HI>redemp|tion</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="5">by a &s;till farther participation of the &s;ame <HI>"Divine Wi&s;dom,"</HI> or <HI>"Word of God."</HI></P>
<P>There is al&s;o another legal term or title, for this <HI>fir&s;t foundation of law;</HI> viz. <Q><HI>the eternal law,</HI></Q> which in our books is properly defined to mean exactly the &s;ame authority as <Q><HI>the law of rea&s;on,</HI></Q> i. e. <HI>the &s;upreme rea&s;on of</HI> DIVINE <Q>WISDOM, <HI>by which</HI> GOD WILLS <HI>that all things created by him, be moved and directed to a good and proper end.</HI>&mdash;LEX AETERNA <HI>nihil aliud e&s;t quam ip&s;a</HI> SUMMA RATIO GUBERNATIONIS RERUM IN DEO, <HI>&s;ive illa &s;umma ratio</HI> DIVINAE SAPIENTIAE, <HI>qua vult</HI> DEUS <HI>omnia a &s;e condita moveri, et dirigi ad bonum et debitum finem,</HI></Q> &amp;c. (Doct. et Stud. c. 1. p. 2.)&mdash;and again, <Q><HI>The</HI> LAW ETERNAL, <HI>under another de&s;cription, is called a perpetual and con&s;tant</HI> WILL <HI>to give to every one his</HI> RIGHT. <HI>Lex Aeterna &s;ub alia de&s;|criptione dicitur perpetua et con&s;tans</HI> VOLUNTAS JUS SUUM UNICUIQUE TRIBUENS.</Q> (ibid.) Here then we find an immoveable foundation of <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> of <HI>right,</HI> of <HI>the rights of man,</HI> of <HI>righteou&s;|ne&s;s,</HI> of <HI>the law of nature,</HI> &amp;c. for all the&s;e terms are parallel, or of the &s;ame import; and are ne|ce&s;&s;arily included in the <HI>law of rea&s;on</HI> or <HI>eternal law,</HI> which is properly called <Q><HI>the fir&s;t law</HI> &mdash; LEX <HI>etiam</HI> AETERNA <HI>dicitur</HI> LEX PRIMA, <HI>et bene dicitur prima, nam fuit ante omnes alias leges: et omnes aliae leges dirivantur ab ea:</HI>&mdash;The LAW ETERNAL <HI>is called the</HI> FIRST LAW, and <HI>well is it called the fir&s;t, for it was before all other laws; and all other laws are derived from it.</HI></Q> In this &s;olemn view of the <HI>fir&s;t foundation of Engli&s;h law,</HI> it mu&s;t evidently be deemed <HI>"a witne&s;s of God,"</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="6">as well as the <HI>&s;econd foundation,</HI> the written <HI>word of God in the Holy Scriptures;</HI> and <HI>both foundations</HI> may well be expre&s;&s;ed together by the more com|pendious terms of <HI>"natural and revealed religion."</HI> In no in&s;tance whatever are <HI>the&s;e</HI> TWO WITNESSES OF GOD more obviou&s;ly and undeniably re&s;i&s;ted than in the <HI>toleration of &s;lavery</HI> and <HI>the Slave Trade,</HI> becau&s;e the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ions are <HI>iniquities</HI> which militate again&s;t <HI>both the foundations,</HI> and therefore the pre&s;ent public que&s;tion, whether the <HI>Slave Trade</HI> ought or ought not to be <HI>aboli&s;hed,</HI> may fairly be deemed an infallible <HI>touch-&s;tone</HI> to di&s;|cover the treachery of pretended <HI>loyali&s;ts;</HI> for no man can be truly <HI>loyal</HI> to God and his country, who is &s;o totally devoid of <HI>fir&s;t principles,</HI> as to <HI>favour &s;lavery!</HI> Let tho&s;e who have <HI>ignorantly</HI> done &s;o, recover their credit by redoubled endea|vours to re&s;tore the honour and con&s;titutional law of their country, which has been wounded by their <HI>treacherous</HI> neglect of the foundations of law, whereby they will otherwi&s;e <HI>incur that indelible &s;tain of infamy,</HI> which our <HI>common</HI> LAW de&s;ervedly fixes on all per&s;ons <HI>who betray the law of the land,</HI> <Q><HI>Legem terrae amittentes perpetuam infamiae notam inde merito incurrunt.</HI></Q> (3 In&s;t. p. 221). But mark the authorities of our <HI>common law</HI> to this purpo&s;e&mdash;<HI>"Liberty,"</HI> is declared by the maxims of the <HI>fir&s;t foundation,</HI> to be <HI>"ine&s;timable"</HI>&mdash; <Q><HI>Libertas e&s;t res ine&s;timabilis</HI></Q> (Jenk. Cent. 52.) and <Q><HI>Li|berty is the greate&s;t jewel.</HI></Q> (Grounds &amp; Rudim. of Law and Equity, p. 196.) and therefore <Q><HI>cruel</HI> of nece&s;&s;ity mu&s;t that law be deemed, which <HI>aug|menteth &s;lavery,</HI> and <HI>dimini&s;heth liberty</HI></Q>&mdash;&s;ays the excellent and worthy Chancellor Forte&s;cue,
<PB N="8" REF="7">who in very dark times of prevailing <HI>be&s;tial power,</HI> nobly a&s;&s;erted the &s;upreme immutable authority of <HI>God's two witne&s;&s;es,</HI> as manife&s;ted in the fir&s;t prin|ciples of our Engli&s;h common law, or legal con|&s;titution.

For be a&s;&s;ured that when the ten kingdoms of Be&s;tial Roman Government are de&s;troyed, the <HI>will of God,</HI> as expre&s;&s;ed in the two foundations of Engli&s;h law, <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>re|vealed religion,</HI> (God's two witne&s;&s;es) will cer|tainly be e&s;tabli&s;hed <HI>"on earth as it is in heaven,"</HI> according to the univer&s;al prayer of the Chri&s;tian church.&mdash;Nay, it will be e&s;tabli&s;hed <Q><HI>under the whole heaven,</HI></Q> (Daniel vii. 27.) &s;o that the only effectual means of avoiding this univer&s;al de&s;truction of <HI>be&s;tial illegality,</HI> is to acknowledge, reverence, and e&s;tabli&s;h, the <HI>two fir&s;t foundations of Engli&s;h Law</HI> above all other authorities; for that mu&s;t be the univer&s;al effect of <HI>the kingdom of Chri&s;t on earth.</HI></P>
<P>If the Legi&s;lators and Lawyers of Maryland and the Carolinas, &s;hall be able to &s;ugge&s;t any thing <HI>like an argument</HI> in oppo&s;ition to the high legal au|thorities which I have cited, they mu&s;t have more <HI>&s;ubtile</HI> heads and <HI>wor&s;e</HI> hearts than I am willing to attribute to any one, who is not obviou&s;ly <HI>actuated</HI> by the grand &s;piritual enemy of man!</P>
