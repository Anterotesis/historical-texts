<P>A SUPPLEMENT TO HUTTON'S ARITHMETIC: CONTAINING THE SOLUTIONS, AT FULL LENGTH, OF THE PROMISCUOUS COLLECTION OF QUESTIONS PROPOSED IN THAT WORK.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE promi&s;cuous collection of que&s;tions pro|po&s;ed in the Arithmetic, was intended for the exerci&s;e of pupils after they had gone through the &s;everal rules of the book, and has been found very u&s;eful to them, by accu&s;toming them to think, and to &s;trike out methods of &s;olution una&s;&s;i&s;ted by other helps. But many gentlemen having expre&s;&s;ed a de|&s;ire to have a publication of the &s;olutions of tho&s;e que&s;tions at full length, that they might have the &s;atisfaction to compare their own &s;olutions with tho&s;e of the Author, and thereby the opportunity of chu&s;ing which they like be&s;t, he has herein complied with their reque&s;t.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;olutions are publi&s;hed apart from the work it&s;elf, that the teacher may avail him&s;elf of them, and yet keep them from the &s;ight of his pupils if he &s;o chu&s;es, each learner having only the book of arith|metic for the purpo&s;es therein mentioned.</P>
<P>The &s;olutions are all delivered in what have been judged to be the be&s;t forms. Sometimes two me|thods are given, where they &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary. In &s;uch of them as contain any proportions, or rule-of-three &s;tatings, the fourth term is generally put down in the form of a vulgar fraction, placing the product of the &s;econd and third terms, as numerator, to be
<PB N="4" REF="3">divided by the fir&s;t as a denominator; the fraction is then abbreviated as much as it can be, before the mul|tiplication and divi&s;ion are performed; by which means generally the&s;e two operations are intirely &s;aved, or at lea&s;t much &s;hortened and facilitated, by bringing them to &s;uch &s;mall numbers as can be ea&s;ily multiplied and divided mentally, and the an&s;wer thence di&s;covered without any other intermediate fi|gures or operations to be written down. So that there is never occa&s;ion for more writing than appears in the operations as here printed, where it will be found that, to avoid the long form of divi&s;ion, the large divi&s;ors are &s;eparated into their component parts, and the divi&s;ions performed &s;eparately by them, which are always done by writing down only the quotients. But where the numbers are &s;o large as to make long divi&s;ions, or multiplications, unavoidable, tho&s;e ope|rations are always placed down at the bottom of the &s;olution, that &s;o none of the nece&s;&s;ary part of the writing in the full &s;olution, might be omitted.</P>
