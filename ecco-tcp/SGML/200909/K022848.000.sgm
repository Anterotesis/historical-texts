<P>No. Nobody ought to have right of &s;uffrage or repre&s;entation in a &s;ociety wherein they have no property. As none are &s;uffered to meddle in the affairs of a benefit &s;ociety or corporation, but tho&s;e who are members, by having a pro|perty therein, &s;o none have a right <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o vote or interfere in the affairs of the government of a country who have to right to the &s;oil; becau&s;e &s;uch are and ought to be accounted &s;trangers&punc;</P>

<P>Do you then account men born in a country as &s;trangers to it, and unworthy of &s;uffrage, that unfortunately may have no title to landed property?</P>

<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="3">
<SPEAKER>Author.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mo&s;t certainly I do. E&s;pecially &s;uch men as be|ing afraid to look their rights in the face, have disfranchi&s;ed and alienated them&s;elves, by denying and renouncing all claim to the &s;oil of their birth, and profe&s;s to be content with the "Right of property in the fruits of their indu&s;try, ingenuity, and good fortune." This is a right of property that a Hot|tentot, a Chine&s;e, or a native of the Moon may claim among us, as well as you. Wherefore, as you are content with the property of a foreigner, pray do likewi&s;e be content with the privileges of a foreigner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Reader.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you, we have a right to univer&s;al &s;uffrage, as well as to the fruits of our labour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Author.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I tell you, that &s;uch Lacklanders as you have no right to &s;uffrage at all. For you are to all intents and pur|po&s;es as much foreigners as the Jews. For if birth gave a title many of them might claim as much as you, having been born in the country, and perhaps too through as many generations. So it is not birth but property that gives right of &s;uffrage in a &s;ociety. Sure you do not, by your &s;uffrages, want to interfere in the e&s;tates and properties of other men? You own that the landed intere&s;t are the legal proprietors of their e&s;tates, and of cour&s;e, the legal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the fountains of life; and yet, by your univer&s;al &s;uffrage you want to modify to your liking, tho&s;e very e&s;tates which you allow to be private property!&mdash; You &s;ay that no one has a right to &s;et a price on your labour, yet you want to cramp others in the di&s;po&s;al of what you allow to be as much their right: You &s;ay you would aboli&s;h the right of primogeniture; you would tax all e&s;tates according to their value; prevent the monopoly of farms; aboa&s;h the game-laws; and thus&mdash;and thus&mdash;at your whim, you would fa&s;hion, reduce, melt, and pare down private property, con|trary to your own fundamental maxims of right and wrong-Pray be con&s;i&s;tent; and let us know, before you begin, where you mean to leave off. If the Rights of Man be definable, as I believe they are, let them be accurately defined, and then let them be &s;acred. This is the only way to procure unani|mity of &s;entiment, and prevent anarchy. Is it nece&s;&s;ary that our rights, like the rainbow, &s;hould always recede from us as we advance? Are they to-day to be &s;ubject to this decree, and to-morrow to tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, as it plea&s;eth a few of our leading demagogues, who only wi&s;h us to know in part, that they may lead us like men upon a &s;ecret expedition.

<SPEAKER>Author.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you don't like the country, and the oppre&s;&s;ion in it, pray leave it. You have no more right to this country than to any other. While you allow the ju&s;tice of private property in land, you ju&s;tify every thing the landed intere&s;t do, both in their own e&s;tates and in the Government, for the country is theirs; and what you call oppre&s;&s;ion, is only their acting con&s;i&s;tently with their intere&s;t, and they certainly have a right to govern their own property, and what affects it. So as by your own confe&s;&s;ion you have neither part nor lot among them, you are of con&s;equence only &s;trangers and &s;ojourners. Wherefore the landed intere&s;t act infinitely more con&s;i&s;tently in debarring &s;uch unprincipled Legi&s;lators from interfering among them, than you do in demanding rights which are in|explicable. Noble architects, truly; who would pull down before you know what to build. Who, to &s;erve &s;ome tempo|rary purpo&s;e, perhaps of plunder, would put all things in a &s;tate of requi&s;ition, and then &s;uffer matters to end in as much, perhaps more, oppre&s;&s;ion than they began.

<HEAD>A LECTURE Read at the Philo&s;ophical Society in New|ca&s;tle, on Nov. the 8th, 1775.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MR. PRESIDENT,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT being my turn to Lecture, I beg to give &s;ome thoughts on this important que&s;tion, viz. Whether mankind, in &s;ociety, reap all the advantages from their natural and equal rights of property in land and liberty, which in that &s;tate they po&s;&s;ibly may, and ought to expect? And as I hope you, Mr. Pre&s;ident, and the good company here are &s;incere friends to truth, I am under no apprehen&s;ions of giving offence by de|fending her cau&s;e with freedom.</P>
<P>That property in land and liberty among men, in a &s;tate of nature, ought to be equal, few, one would fain hope, would be fooli&s;h enough to deny. Therefore, taking this to be granted the country of any people, in a native &s;tate, is properly their common, in which each of them has an equal property, with free liberty to &s;u&s;tain him&s;elf and family with the animals, fruits, and other products thereof. Thus &s;uch a people reap jointly the whole advantages of their country, or neighbour|hood, without having, their right in &s;o doing, called in que&s;|tion by any, not even by the mo&s;t &s;elfi&s;h and corrupt. For upon what mu&s;t they live, if not upon the productions of the coun|try in which they re&s;ide? Surely to deny them that right is, in effect, denying them a right to live.&mdash;Well, methinks &s;ome are now ready to &s;ay, but is it not lawful, rea&s;onable, and ju&s;t for this people to &s;ell, or make a pre&s;ent, even of the whole of their country, or common, to whom they will, to be held by them and their heirs, even for ever?</P>
<P>To this I an&s;wer, If their po&s;terity require no gro&s;&s;er mate|rials to live and move upon than air, it would certainly be very ill-natured, to di&s;pute their right of parting with what of their
<PB N="6" REF="6">own, their po&s;terity would never have occa&s;ion for; but if their po&s;terity cannot live but as gro&s;sly as they do, the &s;ame gro&s;s materials mu&s;t be left them to live upon. For a right to deprive any thing of the means of living, &s;uppo&s;es a right to deprive it of life; and this right ance&s;tors are not &s;uppo&s;ed to have over their po&s;terity.</P>
<P>Hence it is plain, that the land or earth, in any country or neighbourhood, with every thing in or on the &s;ame, or per|shining thereto, belongs at all times to the living inhabitants of the &s;aid country or neighbourhood in an equal manner. For, as I &s;aid before, there is no living but on land and its produc|tions, con&s;equently, what we cannot live without, we have the &s;ame property in, as in our lives.</P>
<P>Now, as &s;ociety ought properly to be nothing but a mutual agreement among the inhabitants of a country, to maintain the natural rights and privileges of one another again&s;t all oppo&s;ers, whether foreign or dome&s;tic, it &s;hould lead one to expect to find tho&s;e rights and privileges no farther infringer upon, among men pretending to be in that &s;tate, than nece&s;&s;ity ab&s;o|lutely required. I &s;ay again, it &s;hould lead one to think &s;o. But I am afraid, whoever does will be mightily mi&s;taken.&mdash;However, as the truth here is of much importance to be known, let it be boldly &s;ought out; in order to which, it may not be improper to trace the pre&s;ent method of holding land among men in &s;ociety, from its original.</P>
<P>If we look back to the origin of the pre&s;ent nations, we &s;hall fee that the land, with all its appurtenances, was claimed by a few, and divided among them&s;elves, in as a&s;&s;ured a manner, as if they had manufactured <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and it had been the work of their own hands; and by being unque&s;tioned, or not called to an account for &s;uch u&s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ations and unju&s;t claims, they fell into a habit of thinking, or, which is the &s;ame thing to the re&s;t of mankind, of acting as if the earth was made for or by them, and did not &s;cruple to call it their own property, which they might di&s;po&s;e of without regard to any other living crea|ture in the univer&s;e. Accordingly they did &s;o, and no man, more than any other creature, could claim a right to &s;o much as a blade of gra&s;s, or a nut, or an acc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, a fi&s;h or a fowl, or any natural production whatever, though to &s;ave his life, without the permi&s;&s;ion of the pretended proprietor; and not a foot of land, water, rock, or heath, but was claimed by one or other of tho&s;e lords; &s;o that all things, men as well as other creatures who lived, were obliged to owe their lives to &s;ome or
<PB N="7" REF="7">other's property; con&s;equently they too, like the brutes, were claimed; and certainly as properly as the wood, herbs, &amp;c., that were nouri&s;hed by the &s;oil. And &s;o we find, that whe|ther they lived, multiplied, worked, or fought, it was all for their re&s;pective lords, and they, God ble&s;s them! mo&s;t graci|ou&s;ly accepted of all as their due. For, by granting the means of life, they granted the life it&s;elf, and of cour&s;e they had a right to all the &s;ervices-and-advantages that the life or death of the creatures they gave life to could yield.</P>
<P>Thus the title of gods &s;eems &s;uitably enough applied to &s;uch great beings: nor is it to be wondered at that no &s;ervices could be thought too great by poor, dependent, needy wretches, to &s;uch mighty and all &s;ufficient lords, in whom they &s;eemed to live and move and have their being. Thus were the fir&s;t land-holders u&s;urpers and tyrant; and all who have &s;ince po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed their lands, have done &s;o by right of inheritance, pur|cha&s;e, &amp;c. from them; and the pre&s;ent proprietors like their predece&s;&s;ors, are proud to own it; and like them too, they exclude all others from the lea&s;t pretence to their re&s;pective properties. And any one of them &s;till can, by laws of their own making (for they are the landlords alone who make the laws) oblige every living creature to remove from off his property, (which, to the great di&s;tre&s;s of mankind, is too oft put in execution); &s;o, of con&s;equence, were all the land|holders to be of one mind, and determined to take their proper|ties into their own hands, all the re&s;t of mankind might go to heaven if they would, for there would be no place found for them here. Thus men may not live in any part of this world, not even where they are born, but as &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">angers, and by the permi&s;&s;ion of the pretender to the property thereof: which permi&s;&s;ion is for the mo&s;t part paid extravagantly for, and they are &s;till advancing the terms of permi&s;&s;ion, though many people are &s;o &s;traitened to pay the pre&s;ent demands, that it is believed in a &s;hort time, if they hold on, there will be few to grant the favour to. And tho&s;e Land-makers, as we &s;hall call them, ju&s;tify all this by the practice of other manufactu|rers, who take all they can get for the products of their hands, and becau&s;e that every one ought to live by his bu&s;ine&s;s as well as he can, and con&s;equently &s;o ought Land-markers.&mdash; Now having before &s;uppo&s;ed it both proved and allowed, that mankind have as equal and ju&s;t a property in land as they have in liberty, air, or the light and heat of the &s;un, and having al&s;o con&s;idered upon what hard conditions they enjoy
<PB N="8" REF="8">tho&s;e common gifts of nature, it is plain they are far from reaping all the advantages from them, which they may and ought to expect.</P>
<P>But le&s;t it &s;hould be &s;aid, that a &s;y&s;tem whereby they may reap more advantages con&s;i&s;tent with the nature of &s;ociety cannot be propo&s;ed, I will attempt to &s;hew you the outlines of &s;uch a plan.</P>
<P>Let it be &s;uppo&s;ed then, that the whole people in &s;ome country, after much rea&s;oning and deliberation, &s;hould con|clude, that every man has an equal property in the land in the neighbourhood where he re&s;ides. They therefore re&s;olve, that if they live in &s;ociety together, it &s;hall only be with a view, that every one may reap all the benefits from their natural rights and privileges po&s;&s;ible. Therefore, a da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is appointed on which the inhabitants of each pari&s;h meet, in their re&s;pective pari&s;hes, to take their long-lo&s;t rights into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and to form them&s;elves into corporations. So, then each pari&s;h be|comes a corporation, an all the men who are inhabitants be|come members or burgers. The land with all that appertains to it, is in every pari&s;h, made the property of the corporation or pari&s;h, with as ample power to let, repair or alter all, or any part thereof, as a lord of the manor enjoys over his lands, hou&s;es &amp;c. but the power of alienating the lea&s;t mor&s;el, in any manner, from the pari&s;h, either at this or any time here|after, is denied For it is &s;olemnly agreed to, by the whole nation, that a pari&s;h that &s;hall either &s;ell, or give away, any part of its landed property, &s;hall be looked upon with as much honor and dete&s;tation, and u&s;ed by them as if they had &s;old all their children to be &s;laves, or ma&s;&s;acred them with their own hands. Thus are there no more nor other landlords, in the whole country than the pari&s;hes; and each of them is &s;o|vereign landlord of its own territories.</P>
<P>O hearken! yet be&s;otted &s;ons of men. By this one bold re&s;olve your chains are eternally broken, and your enemies anihilated. By this one re&s;olve the power, the pride, and the arrogance of the landed intere&s;t, tho&s;e univer&s;al and never cea&s;ing &s;courges and plunderers of your race, are in&s;tantane|ou&s;ly and for ever broken and cut off. For being thus deprived and &s;horn of their revenues they become like &s;horn Samp&s;on, weak as other men; weak as the poor dejected wretches whom they have &s;o long been grinding and treading under toot.</P>
<P>There you may behold the rent, which the people have
<PB N="9" REF="9">paid into the pari&s;h trea&s;uries employed by each pari&s;h in pay|ing the government &s;o much per pound to make up the &s;um, which the parliament or national repre&s;entation at any time think requi&s;ite; in maintaining and relieving its own poor, and peo|ple out of work; in paying the nece&s;&s;ary Officers their &s;ala|ries; in building, repairing, and adorning its hou&s;es, buddges, and other &s;tructures; in making and maintaining convenient and delightful &s;treets, highways, and pa&s;&s;ages both for foot and carriages; in making and maintaining canals, and other conveniences for trade and navigation; in planting and taking in wa&s;te grounds; in providing and keeping up a magazine of ammunition and all forts of arm, &s;ufficient for all its in habitants in ca&s;e of danger from enemies; in premiums for the encourage|ment of agriculture, or any thing el&s;e thought worthy of encouragement; and, in a word, in doing whatever the people think proper; and not as formerly, to &s;upport and &s;pread luxury, pride, and all manner of vice. As for corruption in elections, it has now no being or effect among them; all affairs to be determined by voting either in a full meeting of a pari&s;h, its committees, or in the hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, are done by balloting, &s;o that votings, or elections among them, occa&s;ion no animo&s;ities, for none need to let another know for which &s;ide he votes; all that can be done, therefore, to gain a ma|jority of votes for any thing, is to make it appear in the be&s;t light po&s;&s;ible by &s;peaking or writing.</P>
<P>Among them government does not meddle in every trifle but on the contrary, allows to each pari&s;h the power of but|ting the laws in force in all ca&s;es, and does not interfere, but when they act manife&s;tly to the prejudice of &s;ociety, and the rights and liberties of mankind as e&s;tabli&s;hed in their glorious con&s;titution and laws. For the judgment of a pari&s;h may be as much depended upon as that of a hou&s;e of lords, becau&s;e they have as little to fear from &s;peaking or voting according to truth, as they</P>
<P>A certain number of neighbouring pari&s;hes, chu&s;e delegates to repre&s;ent them in Parliament, Senat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, or Congre&s;s: and each of them pays equally towards their maintainance. They are cho&s;en thus: all the candidates are propo&s;ed in every pari&s;h on the &s;ame day, when the election by balloting immediately proceeds in all the pari&s;hes at once, to prevent too great a con|cour&s;e at one place, and they who are found to have the majo|rity on a proper &s;urvey of the &s;everal pole books are acknow|ledged to be their repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="10">A man by dwelling a whole year in any pari&s;h becomes a pari&s;hioner, or member of its corporation; and retains that privilege, till he lives a full year in &s;ome other, when he be|comes a member in that pari&s;h, and immediately lo&s;es all his right to the former for ever, unle&s;s he cho&s;e to go back and recover it, by dwelling again a full year there. Thus none can be a member of two pari&s;hes at once; and yet a man is always a member of one, though he move ever &s;o oft.</P>
<P>If in any pari&s;h &s;hould be dwelling &s;trangers from foreign nations, or people from di&s;tant pari&s;hes, who by &s;ickne&s;s or other ca&s;ualties &s;hould become &s;o nece&s;&s;itous as to require relief before they have acquired a &s;ettlement by dwelling a full year therein; then this pari&s;h, as if it were their pro|per &s;ettlement, immediately takes them under its humane protection, and the expence thus incurred by any pari&s;h in providing for tho&s;e not properly their own poor, being taken an account of, is deducted by the pari&s;h, out of the fir&s;t payment made to the &s;tar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. Thus poor &s;trangers being the poor of the State, are not looked upon by their new neighbours where they have come to re&s;ide with an envi|ous evil eye left they &s;hould become burthen &s;ome; neither are the poor hara&s;&s;ed about in the extremity of di&s;tre&s;s, and perhaps in a dying condition, to gratify the litigiou&s;ne&s;s of pari&s;hes.</P>
<P>All the men in the pari&s;h, at times of their own chu&s;ing, repair together to a field for that purpo&s;e, with their officers, arms, banners, and all &s;orts of martial mu&s;ic, in order to learn or retain the complete art of war; there they become &s;oldiers! Yet not to mole&s;t their neighbours unprovoked, but to be able to defend what none have a right to di&s;pute their title to the enjoyment of; and woe be to them who occa&s;ion them to do this! they would u&s;e them wor&s;e than highwayman, or pirates, if they got them in their power.</P>
<P>There is no army kept in pay among them, in times of peace: as all have a property in their country to defend, they are alike ready to run to arms when their country is in danger: and when an army is to be &s;ent abroad, it is &s;oon rai&s;ed, of ready trained &s;oldiers, either as volunteers, or by ca&s;ting lots in each <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ari&s;h for &s;o many men.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, as each man has a vote in all the affairs of his pari&s;h, and for his own &s;ake mu&s;t wi&s;h well to the public, the land is let in very &s;mall farms, which makes employment for a greater number of hands, and makes more victualling of all kinds be rai&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="11">There are no tolls or taxes of any kind paid among them, by native or foreigner, but the afore&s;aid rent. The govern|ment, poor, roads, &amp;c. &amp;c. as &s;aid before, are all maintainep by the pari&s;hes with the rent: on which account, all wares, manufactures, allowable trade, employments, or actions, are entirely duty-free. Freedom to do any thing whatever cannot there be bought; a thing is either entirely prohibited as theft or murder; or entirely free to every one without tax or price.</P>
<P>When hou&s;es, lands, or any tenements become vacant they are let publicly by the pari&s;h officers in &s;even years <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">a&s;es to the be&s;t bidder. This way prevents collu&s;ion to the prejudice of the pari&s;h revenue and likewi&s;e prevents partiality.</P>
<P>Methinks I now behold the pari&s;h republics, like fraternal or benefit &s;ocieties each met at quarter-day to pay their rents and to &s;ettle their accounts as well with the &s;tate as with all their parochial officers and workmen, their &s;everal accounts having been examined &s;ome days before.</P>
<P>On that day which is always a day, not, as now of &s;or|row, but of gladne&s;s, when the rents are all paid in, and the &s;um total proclaimed, the fir&s;t account to be &s;ettled is the demand made by the national repre&s;entation of &s;o much per pound in behalf of the &s;tate, which &s;um is &s;et apart to be &s;ent to the national trea&s;ury. Another &s;um is al&s;o &s;et apart for the pari&s;h trea&s;ury to an&s;wer contingencies till next quarter-day. Next the &s;alaries of the pari&s;h officers are paid. Then are paid the re&s;pective bills of their workmen as ma&s;ons, bricklayers, carpenters, glaziers, painters, &amp;c. who have been employed in building or repairing the hou&s;es and other pari&s;h buildings. After the&s;e come the paviour, lamplighters, watchmen, &s;cavengers, and all the other work-people employed by the pari&s;h, to receive their demands, until none remain. Then the re&s;idue of the public money or rents after all public demands are thus &s;atisfied, which is always two-thirds, more or le&s;s, of the whole &s;um collected, comes la&s;tly to be di&s;po&s;ed of, which is the mo&s;t plea&s;ant part of the bu&s;ine&s;s to every one. The number of pari&s;hioners, and the &s;um thus le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to be divided among them being announced, each, without re&s;pect of per&s;ons is &s;ent home joyfully with an equal &s;hare.</P>
<Q><L>So if by &s;ickne&s;s or mi&s;chance,</L>
<L>To poverty &s;ome wane,</L>
<L>Their dividend of rents will come,</L>
<L>To &s;et them up again.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="12" REF="12">
Though I have only &s;poke of pari&s;hioners receiving dividends, which may be under&s;tood as if men only were meant to &s;hare the re&s;idue of the rents, yet I would have no objection, if the people thought proper, to divide it among the whole number of &s;ouls, male and female, married and &s;ingle in a pari&s;h from the infant of a day old to the &s;econd infantage of hoary hairs. For as all of every age, legitimate and illegitimate, have a right to live on the public common, and as that common, for the &s;ake of cultivation, mu&s;t be let out for rent, that rent, then, ought to be equally enjoyed by every human being, in|&s;tead of the foil which they are thus deprived of.</P>
<P>But what makes this pro&s;pect yet more glorious is, that after this empire of right and rea&s;on is thus e&s;tabli&s;hed it will &s;tand for ever. Force and corruption attempting its downfall &s;hall equally be baffled, and all other nations &s;truck with won|der and admiration at its happine&s;s and &s;tability, &s;hall follow the example; and thus the whole earth &s;hall at la&s;t be happy and live like brethren.</P>

<HEAD>An Important QUERY.</HEAD>
<P>Has the univer&s;al conce&s;&s;ion and agitation of political opinions, occa&s;ioned by the French Revolution, produced no publication likely, by containing a brief and clear &s;olution of all the great political problems, to outlive the pre&s;ent ferment, and become a permanent and &s;tanding School of Man's Rights to ri&s;ing Gene|rations?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> Yes, there is one that was compiled and publi&s;hed with that exten&s;ive view, and who&s;e &s;olid worth will daily become more apparent, as the temporary and tautological productions of the moment &s;ink into oblivion. This Publication is entitled, in conformity to the phra&s;es of the times, "Pigs' Meat, or Le&s;&s;ons for the Swini&s;h Multitude," con&s;i&s;ting of 3 volumes duodecimo, price 2 s 6 d. each, half bound. Nothing but the title is local and temporary, and it may, perhaps, hereafter be more generally printed and known under the title of the Univer&s;al School of Man's Rights.</P>
