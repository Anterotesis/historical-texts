<HEAD>CONTINUATION OF PART V. OF BIRDS OF THE CRANE KIND.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Of the Bittern or Mire-drum.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE who have walked in an evening by the &s;edgy &s;ides of
unfrequented rivers, mu&s;t re|member a variety of notes from different
water-fowl: the loud &s;cream of the wild goo&s;e, the croaking of the mallard,
the whining of the lapwing, and the tremulous neighing of the jack-&s;nipe. But
of all tho&s;e &s;ounds, there is none &s;o di&s;mally hollow as the booming of
the <PB N="2" REF="5"> bittern. It is impo&s;&s;ible for words to give tho&s;e
who have not heard this evening-call an adequate idea of its &s;olemnity. It is
like the interrupted bellowing of a bull, but hollower and louder, and is heard
at a mile's di&s;tance, as if i&s;&s;uing from &s;ome formidable being that
re&s;ided at the bottom of the waters.</P>
<P>The bird, however, that produces this ter|rifying &s;ound is
not &s;o big as an heron, with a weaker bill, and not above four inches long.
It differs from the heron chiefly in its colour, which is in general of a
palei&s;h yellow, &s;potted and barred with black. Its wind-pipe is fitted to
produce the &s;ound for which it is remark|able; the lower part of it dividing
into the lungs is &s;upplied with a thin loo&s;e membrane, that can be filled
with a large body of air and exploded at plea&s;ure. The&s;e bellowing
explo|&s;ions are chiefly heard from the beginning of &s;pring to the end of
autumn; and, however awful they may &s;eem to us, are the calls to
court|&s;hip, or of connubial felicity.</P>
<P>From the loudne&s;s and &s;olemnity of the note, many have
been led to &s;uppo&s;e, that the bird made u&s;e of external in&s;truments to
produce it, and that &s;o &s;mall a body could never eject &s;uch a quantity of
tone. The common people are of opinion, that it thru&s;ts its bill into a reed 
<PB N="3" REF="6"> that &s;erves as a pipe for &s;welling the note above its
natural pitch; while others, and in this num|ber we find Thom&s;on the poet,
imagine that the bittern puts its head under water, and then violently blowing
produces its boomings. The fact is, that the bird is &s;ufficiently provided by
nature for this call; and it is often heard where there are neither reeds nor
waters to a&s;&s;i&s;t its &s;onorous invitations.</P>
<P>It hides in the &s;edges by day, and begins its call in the
evening, booming &s;ix or eight times, and then di&s;continuing for ten or
twenty minutes to renew the &s;ame &s;ound. This is a call it never gives but
when undi&s;turbed and at liberty. When its retreats among the &s;edges are
invaded, when it dreads or expects the approach of an enemy, it is then
perfectly &s;ilent. This call it has never been heard to utter when taken or
brought up in dome&s;tic captivity; it continues under the control of man a
mute forlorn bird, equally incapable of attachment or in&s;truction. But,
though its boomings are always performed in &s;olitude, it has a &s;cream which
is generally heard upon the &s;eizing its prey, and which is &s;ometimes
extorted by fear.</P>
<P>This bird, though of the heron-kind, is yet neither &s;o
de&s;tructive nor &s;o voracious. It is a retired timorous animal, concealing
it&s;elf <PB N="4" REF="7"> in the mid&s;t of reeds and mar&s;hy places, and
living upon frogs, in&s;ects, and vegetables; and though &s;o nearly
re&s;embling the heron in figure, yet differing much in manners and ap|petites.
As the heron builds on the tops of the highe&s;t trees, the bittern lays its
ne&s;t in a &s;edgy margin, or amid&s;t a tuft of ru&s;hes. The heron builds
with &s;ticks and wool; the bittern compo&s;es its &s;impler habitation of
&s;edges, the leaves of water-plants and dry ru&s;hes. The heron lays four
eggs; the bittern generally &s;even or eight, of an a&s;h-green colour. The
heron feeds its young for many days; the bittern in three days leads its little
ones to their food. In &s;hort, the heron is lean and cadaverous,
&s;ub|&s;i&s;ting chiefly upon animal food; the bittern is plump and fle&s;hy,
as it feeds upon vegetables when more nouri&s;hing food is wanting.</P>
<P>It cannot be, therefore, from its voracious appetites, but its
hollow boomb, that the bittern is held in &s;uch dete&s;tation by the vulgar. I
re|member in the place where I was a boy with what terror this bird's note
affected the whole village; they con&s;idered it as the pre&s;age of &s;ome
&s;ad event; and generally found or made one to &s;ucceed it. I do not &s;peak
ludicrou&s;ly; but if any per&s;on in the neighbourhood died, they &s;uppo&s;ed
it could not be otherwi&s;e, for the <PB N="5" REF="8"> night-raven had
foretold it; but if nobody hap|pened to die, the death of a cow or a &s;heep
gave completion to the prophecy.</P>
<P>Whatever terror it may in&s;pire among the &s;imple, its
fle&s;h is greatly in e&s;teem among the luxurious. For this rea&s;on, it is as
eagerly &s;ought after by the fowler as it is &s;hunned by the pea&s;ant; and
as it is a heavy ri&s;ing, &s;low winged bird, it does not often e&s;cape him.
Indeed, it &s;eldom ri&s;es but when almo&s;t trod upon; and &s;eems to &s;eek
protection rather from conceal|ment than flight. At the latter end of autumn,
however, in the evening, its wonted indolence appears to for&s;ake it. It is
then &s;een ri&s;ing in a &s;piral a&s;cent till it is quite lo&s;t from the
view, making at the &s;ame time a &s;ingular noi&s;e very different from its
former boomings. Thus the &s;ame animal is often &s;een to a&s;&s;ume different
de&s;ires; and while the Latins have given the bittern the name of the &s;tar
reaching bird (or the <HI>&s;tellaris</HI>) the Greeks, taking its character
from its more con&s;tant habits, have given it the title of the
<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, or the lazy.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Of the Spoonbill or Shoveler.</HEAD>
<P>AS we proceed in our de&s;cription of the crane kind, birds of
peculiar forms offer, not entirely like the crane, and yet not &s;o far
dif|ferent as to rank more properly with any other cla&s;s. Where the long neck
and &s;tilt-like legs of the crane are found, they make too &s;triking a
re&s;emblance, not to admit &s;uch birds of the the number; and though the bill
or even the toes &s;hould entirely differ, yet the outlines of the figure, and
the natural habits and di&s;po&s;i|tions being the &s;ame, the&s;e are
&s;ufficient to mark their place in the general groupe of nature.</P>
<P>The Spoonbill is one of tho&s;e birds which differs a good
deal from the crane, yet ap|proaches this cla&s;s more than any other. The body
is more bulky for its height, and the bill is very differently formed from that
of any other bird whatever. Yet &s;till it is a comparatively tall bird; it
feeds among waters; its toes are divided; and it &s;eems to po&s;&s;e&s;s the
natural di&s;po&s;itions of the crane. The European &s;poonbill is of about the
bulk of a crane; but <PB REF="10">

is above four feet high, the other is not more than three feet three inches.
The common colour of tho&s;e of Europe, is a dirty white; but tho&s;e of
America are of a beautiful ro&s;e colour, or a delightful crim&s;om. Beauty of
plumage &s;eems to be the prerogative of all the birds of that continent; and
we here &s;ee the mo&s;t &s;plendid tints be&s;towed on a bird, who&s;e figure
is &s;ufficient to de&s;troy the effects of its colouring; for its bill is &s;o
odly fa&s;hioned, and its eyes &s;o &s;tupidly &s;taring, that its fine
feathers only tend to add &s;plendour to deformity. The bill, which in this
bird is &s;o very particular, is about &s;even inches long, and running out
broad at the end, as its name ju&s;tly &s;erves to denote; it is there about an
inch and a half wide. This &s;trangely fa&s;hioned in&s;trument, in &s;ome is
black; in others of a light grey; and in tho&s;e of America, it is of a red
colour, like the re&s;t of the body. All round the upper chap there runs a kind
of rim, with which it covers that beneath; and as for the re&s;t, its cheeks,
and its throat, are without feathers, and covered with a black &s;kin.</P>
<P>A bird &s;o oddly fa&s;hioned, might be expected to
po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome very peculiar appetites; but the &s;poonbill &s;eems to
lead a life entirely re&s;embling all tho&s;e of the crane kind; and Nature,
when <PB N="8" REF="14"> &s;he made the bill of this bird &s;o very broad,
&s;eems rather to have &s;ported with its form, than to aim at any final
cau&s;e for which to adapt it. In fact, it is but a poor philo&s;ophy to
a&s;cribe every capricious variety in nature to &s;ome &s;alu|tary purpo&s;e:
in &s;uch &s;olutions we only impo&s;e upon each other; and often wilfully
contradict our own belief. There mu&s;t be imperfections in every being, as
well as capacities of enjoyment. Between both, the animal leads a life of
mo|derate felicity; in part making u&s;e of its many natural advantages, and in
part nece&s;&s;arily con|forming to the imperfections of its figure.</P>
<P>The &s;hoveler chiefly feeds upon frogs, toads and &s;erpents;
of which, particularly at the Cape of Good Hope, they de&s;troy great num|bers.
The inhabitants of that country hold them in as much e&s;teem as the ancient
Egyptians did their bird ibis: the &s;hoveler runs tamely about their hou&s;es;
and they are content with its &s;ociety, as a u&s;eful though an homely
companion. They are never killed; and in|deed they are good for nothing when
they are dead, for the fle&s;h is unfit to be eaten.</P>
<P>This bird breeds in Europe, in company with the heron, in high
trees; and in a ne&s;t formed of the &s;ame materials. Willoughby tells us,
that in a certain grove, at a village <PB N="9" REF="15"> called Seven Huys,
near Leyden, they build and breed yearly in great numbers. In this grove
al&s;o, the heron, the bittern, the cor|morant, and the &s;hag, have taken up
their re&s;idence, and annually bring forth their young together. Here the
crane kind &s;eem to have formed their general rendezvous; and, as the
inhabitants &s;ay, every &s;ort of bird has its &s;e|veral quarter, where none
but their own tribe are permitted to re&s;ide. Of this grove the pea&s;ants of
the country make good profit. When the young ones are ripe, tho&s;e that farm
the grove, with a hook at the end of a long pole, catch hold of the bough on
which the ne&s;t is built, and &s;hake out the young ones; but &s;ometimes the
ne&s;t and all tumble down together.</P>
<P>The &s;hoveler lays from three to five eggs; white, and
powdered with a few &s;anguine or pale &s;pots. We &s;ometimes &s;ee, in the
cabinets of the curious, the bills of American &s;hovelers, twice as big and as
long as tho&s;e of the com|mon kind among us; but the&s;e birds have not yet
made their way into Europe.</P>

<PB N="10" REF="16">
<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. The Flamingo.</HEAD>
<P>THE Flamingo has the ju&s;te&s;t right to be placed among
cranes; and though it happens to be web-footed, like birds of the goo&s;e kind,
yet its height, figure and appetites, entirely remove it from that groveling
cla&s;s of animals. With a longer neck and legs than any other of the crane
kind, it &s;eeks its food by wading among waters; and only differs from all of
this tribe in the manner of &s;eizing its prey; for as the heron makes u&s;e of
its claws, the flamingo u&s;es only its bill, which is &s;trong and thick for
the purpo&s;e, the claws being u&s;ele&s;s, as they are feeble, and webbed like
tho&s;e of water-fowl.</P>
<P>The flamingo is the mo&s;t remarkable of all the crane kind,
the talle&s;t, bulkie&s;t, and the mo&s;t beautiful. The body, which is of a
beautiful &s;carlet, is no bigger than that of a &s;wan; but its legs and neck
are of &s;uch an ex|traordinary length, that when it &s;tands erect, it is
&s;ix feet &s;ix inches high. Its wings, extended, are five feet &s;ix inches
from tip to tip; and it is four feet eight inches from tip to tail. The

</FIGURE> <PB N="11" REF="18"> head is round and &s;mall, with
a large bill, &s;even inches long, partly red, partly black, and crooked like a
bow. The legs and thighs, which are not much thicker than a man's finger, are
about two feet eight inches high; and its neck near three feet long. The feet
are not furni&s;hed with &s;harp claws, as in others of the crane kind; but
feeble, and united by mem|branes, as in tho&s;e of the goo&s;e. Of what u&s;e
the&s;e membranes are does not appear, as the bird is never &s;een &s;wimming,
its legs and thighs being &s;ufficient for bearing it into tho&s;e depths where
it &s;eeks for prey.</P>
<P>This extraordinary bird is now chiefly found in America, but
was once known on all the coa&s;ts of Europe. Its beauty, its &s;ize, and the
peculiar delicacy of its fle&s;h, have been &s;uch temptations to de&s;troy or
take it, that it has long &s;ince de&s;erted the &s;hores frequented by man,
and taken refuge in countries that are as yet but thinly peopled. In tho&s;e
de&s;ert regions, the flamingos live in a &s;tate of &s;ociety, and under a
better polity than any other of the feathered creation.</P>
<P>When the Europeans fir&s;t came to America, and coa&s;ted down
along the African &s;hores, they found the flamingos on &s;everal &s;hores on
either continent, gentle and no way di&s;tru&s;tful <PB N="12" REF="19"> of
mankind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Albin's New Hi&s;tory of
Birds.</BIBL></NOTE>. They had long been u&s;ed to &s;ecurity, in the
exten&s;ive &s;olitudes they had cho&s;en; and knew no enemies, but tho&s;e
they could very well evade or oppo&s;e. The Negroes and the native Americans,
were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed but of few de&s;tructive arts for killing them at a
di|&s;tance; and when the bird perceived the arrow, it well knew how to avoid
it. But it was otherwi&s;e when the Europeans fir&s;t came among them: the
&s;ailors, not con&s;idering that the dread of fire-arms was totally unknown in
that part of the world, gave the flamingo the cha|racter of a fooli&s;h bird,
that &s;uffered it&s;elf to be approached and &s;hot at. When the fowler had
killed one, the re&s;t of the flock, far from attempting to fly, only regarded
the fall of their companion in a kind of fixed a&s;toni&s;h|ment: another and
another &s;hot was di&s;|charged; and thus the fowler often levelled the whole
flock, before one of them began to think of e&s;caping.</P>
<P>But at pre&s;ent it is very different in that part of the
world; and the flamingo is not only one of the &s;carce&s;t but of the
&s;hye&s;t birds in the world, and the mo&s;t difficult of approach. They
chiefly keep near the mo&s;t de&s;erted and inho&s;pitable &s;hores; near
&s;alt-water lakes and <PB N="13" REF="20"> &s;wampy i&s;lands. They come down
to the banks of rivers by day; and often retire to the inland, mountainous
parts of the country at the ap|proach of night. When &s;een by mariners in the
day, they always appear drawn up in a long clo&s;e line of two or three hundred
to|gether; and, as Dampier tells us, pre&s;ent, at the di&s;tance of half a
mile, the exact repre|&s;entation of a long brick wall. Their rank, however, is
broken when they &s;eek for food; but they always appoint one of the number as
a watch, who&s;e only employment is to ob|&s;erve and give notice of danger,
while the re&s;t are feeding. As &s;oon as this tru&s;ty centinel perceives the
remote&s;t appearance of danger, he gives a loud &s;cream, with a voice as
&s;hrill as a trumpet, and in&s;tantly the whole cohort are upon the wing. They
feed in &s;ilence; but, upon this occa&s;ion, all the flock are in one chorus,
and fill the air with intolerable &s;cream|ings.</P>
<P>From this it appears that the flamingos are very difficult to
be approached at pre&s;ent, and that they avoid mankind with the mo&s;t
cautious timidity; however, it is not from any anti|pathy to man that they
&s;hun his &s;ociety, for in &s;ome villages, as we are a&s;&s;ured by Labat,
along the coa&s;t of Africa, the flamingos come <PB N="14" REF="21"> in great
numbers to make their re&s;idence among the natives. There they a&s;&s;emble by
thou&s;ands, perched on the trees, within and about the village; and are &s;o
very clamorous, that the &s;ound is heard at near a mile di&s;tance. The
Negroes are fond of their company; and con&s;ider their &s;ociety as a gift of
Heaven, as a protection from accidental evils. The French, who are admitted to
this part of the coa&s;t, cannot, without &s;ome degree of di&s;content, &s;ee
&s;uch a quantity of game untouched, and ren|dered u&s;ele&s;s by the
&s;uper&s;tition of the natives: they now and then privately &s;hoot &s;ome of
them, when at a convenient di&s;tance from the village, and hide them in the
long gra&s;s, if they perceive any of the Negroes approaching; for they would
probably &s;tand a chance of being ill treated, if the blacks di&s;covered
their &s;acred birds were thus unmercifully treated.</P>
<P>Sometimes, in their wild &s;tate, they are &s;hot by mariners;
and their young, which run ex|ce&s;&s;ively fa&s;t, are often taken. Labat has
frequently taken them with nets, properly ex|tended round the places they breed
in. When their long legs are entangled in the me&s;hes, they are then
unqualified to make their e&s;cape: but they &s;till continue to combat with
their de&s;troyer; and the old ones, though &s;eized by <PB N="15" REF="22">
the head, will &s;cratch with their claws; and the&s;e, though &s;eemingly
inoffen&s;ive, very often do mi&s;chief. When they are fairly di&s;engaged from
the net, they neverthele&s;s pre&s;erve their natural ferocity; they refu&s;e
all nouri&s;hment; they peck and combat with their claws at every opportunity.
The fowler is therefore under a nece&s;&s;ity of de&s;troying them, when taken;
as they would only pine and die, if left to them|&s;elves in captivity. The
fle&s;h of the old ones is black and hard; though, Dampier &s;ays, well
ta&s;ted: that of the young ones is &s;till better. But, of all other
delicacies, the flamingo's tongue is the mo&s;t celebrated. A di&s;h of
fla|mingo's tongues, &s;ays our author, is a fea&s;t for an emperor. In fact,
the Roman emperors con&s;idered them as the highe&s;t luxury; and we have an
account of one of them, who procured fifteen hundred flamingo's tongues to be
&s;erved up in a &s;ingle di&s;h. The tongue of this bird, which is &s;o much
&s;ought after, is a good deal larger than that of any other bird whatever. The
bill of the flamingo is like a large black box, of an irregular figure, and
filled with a tongue which is black and gri&s;tly; but what peculiar flavour it
may po&s;&s;e&s;s, I leave to be determined by &s;uch as under&s;tand good
eating better than I do. It is probable, that the <PB N="16" REF="23"> beauty
and &s;carcity of the bird, might be the fir&s;t inducements to &s;tudious
gluttony to fix upon its tongue as meat for the table. What Dampier &s;ays of
the goodne&s;s of its fle&s;h, cannot &s;o well be relied on; for Dampier was
often hungry, and thought any thing good that could be eaten: he avers, indeed,
with Labat, that the fle&s;h is black, tough and fi&s;hy; &s;o that we can
hardly give him credit, when he a&s;&s;erts; that its fle&s;h can be formed
into a luxurious entertainment.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds, as was &s;aid, always go in flocks together;
and they move in rank, in the manner of cranes. They are &s;ometimes &s;een, at
the break of day, flying down in great numbers from the mountains; and
conducting each other with a trumpet cry, that &s;ounds like the word Tococo,
from whence the &s;avages of Canada have given them the name. In their flight
they appear to great advantage; for they then &s;eem of as bright a red as a
burning coal. When they di&s;po&s;e them&s;elves to feed, their cry cea&s;es;
and then they di&s;per&s;e over a whole mar&s;h, in &s;ilence and
a&s;&s;iduity. Their manner of feeding is very &s;ingular: the bird thru&s;ts
down its head, &s;o that the upper convex &s;ide of the bill &s;hall only touch
the ground; and in this po&s;ition the animal appears, as it were, &s;tanding
upon <PB N="17" REF="24"> its head. In this manner it paddles and moves the
bill about, and &s;eizes whatever fi&s;h or in&s;ect happens to offer. For this
purpo&s;e the upper chap is notched at the edges, &s;o as to hold its prey with
the greater &s;ecurity. Cate&s;by, how|ever, gives a different account of their
feeding. According to him, they thus place the upper chap undermo&s;t, and &s;o
work about, in order to pick up a &s;eed from the bottom of the water, that
re&s;embles millet: but as in picking up this, they nece&s;&s;arily al&s;o
&s;uck in a great quantity of mud, their bill is toothed at the edges, in
&s;uch a manner as to let out the mud, while they &s;wallow the grain.</P>
<P>Their time of breeding is according to the climate in which
they re&s;ide: in North America they breed in our &s;ummer; on the other &s;ide
the line they take the mo&s;t favourable &s;ea&s;on of the year. They build
their ne&s;ts in exten&s;ive mar&s;hes, and where they are in no danger of a
&s;urprize. The ne&s;t is not le&s;s curious than the animal that builds it: it
is rai&s;ed from the &s;urface of the pool about a foot and a half, formed of
mud, &s;craped up together, and har|dened by the &s;un, or the heat of the
bird's body: it re&s;embles a truncated cone, or one of the pots which we &s;ee
placed on chimnies; on the top it <PB N="18" REF="25"> is hollowed out to the
&s;hape of the bird, and in that cavity the female lays her eggs, without any
lining but the well cemented mud that forms the &s;ides of the building. She
always lays two eggs, and no more; and, as her legs are immoderately long,
&s;he &s;traddles on the ne&s;t, while her legs hang down, one on each &s;ide,
into the water.</P>
<P>The young ones are a long while before they are able to fly;
but they run with amaz|ing &s;wiftne&s;s. They are &s;ometimes caught; and,
very different from the old ones, &s;uffer them&s;elves to be carried home, and
are tamed very ea&s;ily. In five or &s;ix days they become familiar, eat out of
the hand, and drink a &s;urprizing quantity of &s;ea-water. But though they are
ea&s;ily rendered dome&s;tic, they are not reared without the greate&s;t
difficulty; for they generally pine away, for want of their natural &s;upplies,
and die in a &s;hort time. While they are yet young, their colours are very
different from tho&s;e lively tints they acquire with age. In their fir&s;t
year they are covered with plumage of a white colour, mixed with grey; in the
&s;econd year the whole body is white, with here and there a &s;light tint of
&s;carlet; and the great covert feathers of the wings are black: the third year
the bird acquires all its beauty; the <PB N="19" REF="26"> plumage of the whole
body is &s;carlet, except &s;ome of the feathers in the wings, that &s;till
retain their &s;able hue. Of the&s;e beautiful plumes, the &s;avages make
various ornaments; and the bird is &s;ometimes &s;kinned by the Eu|ropeans, to
make muffs. But the&s;e have dimi|ni&s;hed in heir price, &s;ince we have
obtained the art of dying feathers of the brighte&s;t &s;carlet.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. Of the Avo&s;etta or Scooper, and the Corrira or
Runner.</HEAD>
<P>THE extraordinary &s;hape of the Avo&s;etta's bill might
incline us to wi&s;h for its hi&s;tory; and yet in that we are not able to
indulge the reader. Natural hi&s;torians have hitherto, like ambitious
monarchs, &s;hewn a greater fondne&s;s for extending their dominions, than
cultivating what they po&s;&s;e&s;s. While they have been la|bouring to add new
varieties to their catalogues, they have neglected to &s;tudy the hi&s;tory of
ani|mals already known.</P>
<P>The Avo&s;etta is chiefly found in Italy, and now and then
comes over into England. It is about the &s;ize of a pigeon, is a pretty
upright bird, and has extremely long legs for its &s;ize. But the mo&s;t
extraordinary part of its figure, and that by which it may be di&s;tingui&s;hed
from all others of the feathered tribe, is the bill, which turns up like a
hook, in an oppo&s;ite di|rection to that of the hawk or the parrot. This
extraordinary bill is black, flat, &s;harp and flex|ible at the end, and about
three inches and an half long. From its being bare a long way 
<PB N="21" REF="28"> above the knee, it appears that it lives and wades in the
waters. It has a chirping, pert note, as we are told; but with its other habits
we are entirely unacquainted. I have placed it, from its &s;lender figure,
among the cranes; although it is web-footed, like the duck. It is one of
tho&s;e birds of who&s;e hi&s;tory we are yet in expectation.</P>
<P>To this bird of the crane kind, &s;o little known, I will add
another, &s;till le&s;s known; the Corrira or Runner, of Aldrovandus. All we
are told of it is, that it has the longe&s;t legs of all web-footed fowls,
except the flamingo and avo&s;etta; that the bill is &s;traight, yellow and
black at the ends; that the pupils of the eyes are &s;urrounded with two
circles, one of which is bay, and the other white: below, near the belly, it is
whiti&s;h; the tail, with two white feathers, black at the extremities; and
that the upper part of the body is of the colour of ru&s;ty iron. It is thus
that we are obliged to &s;ub&s;titute dry de&s;cription for in&s;tructive
hi&s;tory; and em|ploy words, to expre&s;s tho&s;e &s;hadings of colour which
the pencil alone can convey.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. Of Small Birds of the Crane Kind, with the Thighs
partly bare of Feathers.</HEAD>
<P>AS I have taken my di&s;tinctions rather from the general form
and manners of birds, than from their minuter though perhaps more preci&s;e
di&s;criminations, it will not be expected that I &s;hould here enter into a
particular hi&s;tory of a numerous tribe of birds, who&s;e manners and forms
are &s;o very much alike. Of many of them we have &s;carce any account in our
hi&s;torians, but tedious de&s;criptions of their dimen&s;ions, and the colour
of their plumage; and of the re&s;t, the hi&s;tory of one is &s;o much that of
all, that it is but the &s;ame account repeated to a mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting
reiteration. I will therefore groupe them into one general draught; in which
the more eminent, or the mo&s;t whim|&s;ical, will naturally &s;tand forward on
the canvas.</P>
<P>In this groupe we find an exten&s;ive tribe of native birds,
with their varieties and affinities; and we might add an hundred others, of
di&s;|tant climates, of which we know little more than the colour and the name.
In this li&s;t is exhibited the Curlew, a bird of about the &s;ize 
<PB N="23" REF="30"> of a duck, with a bill four inches long: the Woodcock,
about the &s;ize of a pigeon, with a bill three inches long: the God wit, of
the &s;ame &s;ize; the bill four inches: the Green Shank, longer legged; the
bill two inches and an half: the Red Shank, differing in the colour of its feet
from the former: the Snipe, le&s;s by half, with a bill three inches. Then with
&s;horter bills&mdash;The Ruff, with a collar of feathers round the neck of the
male; the Knot, the Sand|piper, the Sanderling, the Dunlin, the Purre and the
Stint. To conclude; with bills very &s;hort&mdash;The Lapwing, the Green
Plover, the Grey Plover, the Dottrel, the Turn&s;tone and the Sea-lark.
The&s;e, with their affinities, are properly natives or vi&s;itants of this
country; and are di&s;per&s;ed along our &s;hores, rivers and watery grounds.
Taking in the birds of this kind, belonging to other countries, the li&s;t
would be very widely extended; and the whole of this cla&s;s, as de&s;cribed by
Bri&s;&s;on, would amount to near an hundred.</P>
<P>All the&s;e birds po&s;&s;e&s;s many marks in common; though
&s;ome have peculiarities that de&s;erve re|gard. All the&s;e birds are bare of
feathers above the knee, or above the heel, as &s;ome naturali&s;ts chu&s;e to
expre&s;s it. In fact, that part which I <PB N="24" REF="31"> call the knee, if
compared with the legs of mankind, is analogous to the heel: but, as it is
commonly conceived otherwi&s;e, I have con|formed to the general
apprehen&s;ion. I &s;ay, therefore, that all the&s;e birds are bare of
fea|thers above the knee; and in &s;ome they are wanting half way up the thigh.
The nudity in that part, is partly natural, and partly pro|duced by all birds
of this kind habitually wad|ing in water. The older the bird, the barer are its
thighs; yet even the young ones have not the &s;ame downy covering reaching
&s;o low as the birds of any other cla&s;s. Such a covering there would rather
be prejudical, as being continually liable to get wet in the water.</P>
<P>As the&s;e birds are u&s;ually employed rather in running than
in flying, and as their food lies entirely upon the ground, and not on trees,
or in the air, &s;o they run with great &s;wiftne&s;s for their &s;ize, and the
length of their legs a&s;&s;i&s;ts their velocity. But as, in &s;eeking their
food, they are often obliged to change their &s;tation; &s;o al&s;o are they
equally &s;wift of wing, and traver&s;e immen&s;e tracts of country without
much fatigue.</P>
<P>It has been thought by &s;ome, that a part of this cla&s;s
lived upon an oily &s;lime, found in <PB N="25" REF="32"> the bottoms of
ditches and of weedy pools; they were thence termed, by Willoughby,
Mud-&s;uckers. But later di&s;coveries have &s;hewn that, in the&s;e places,
they hunt for the caterpillars and worms of in&s;ects. From hence, therefore,
we may generally a&s;&s;ert, that all birds of this cla&s;s live upon animals
of one kind or another. The long billed birds &s;uck up worms and in&s;ects
from the bottom; tho&s;e furni&s;hed with &s;horter bills, pick up &s;uch
in&s;ects as lie nearer the &s;urface of the meadow, or among the &s;ands on
the &s;ea-&s;hore.</P>
<P>Thus the curlew, the wood-cock, and the &s;nipe, are ever
&s;een in pla&s;hy brakes, and un|der covered hedges, a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly
employed in &s;eeking out in&s;ects in their worm &s;tate; and it &s;eems, from
their fatne&s;s, that they find a plentiful &s;upply. Nature, indeed, has
fur|ni&s;hed them with very convenient in&s;truments for procuring their food.
Their bills are made &s;ufficiently long for &s;earching; but &s;till more,
they are endowed with an exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility at the point, for feeling
their provi&s;ion. They are furni&s;hed with no le&s;s than three pair of
nerves, equal almo&s;t to the optic nerves in thickne&s;s; which pa&s;s from
the roof of the mouth, and run along the upper chap to the point.</P>
<P>Nor are tho&s;e birds with &s;horter bills, and 
<PB N="26" REF="33"> de&s;titute of &s;uch convenient in&s;truments, with|out a
proper provi&s;ion made for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The lapwing, the
&s;and-piper, and the red-&s;hank, run with &s;urprizing rapidity along the
&s;urface of the mar&s;h, or the &s;ea-&s;hore, quarter their ground with great
dexterity, and leave nothing of the in&s;ect kind that happens to lie on the
&s;urface. The&s;e, however, are neither &s;o fat nor &s;o delicate as the
former; as they are obliged to toil more for a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, they are
ea&s;ily &s;atisfied with whatever offers; and their fle&s;h often contracts a
reli&s;h from what has been their late&s;t, or their principal, food.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the birds formerly de&s;cribed, have &s;tated
&s;ea&s;ons for feeding and re&s;t: the eagle kind prowl by day, and at evening
repo&s;e; the owl by night, and keeps un&s;een in the day-time. But the&s;e
birds, of the crane kind, &s;eem at all hours employed: they are &s;eldom at
re&s;t by day; and, during the whole night &s;ea&s;on, every meadow and mar&s;h
re&s;ounds with their different calls, to court&s;hip or to food. This &s;eems
to be the time when they lea&s;t fear interruption from man; and though they
fly at all times, yet, at this &s;ea&s;on, they appear more a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly
employed, both in providing for their pre&s;ent &s;upport, and continuing that
of po&s;terity. This is u&s;ually the &s;ea&s;on when <PB N="27" REF="34"> the
in&s;iduous fowler &s;teals in upon their occu|pations, and fills the whole
meadow with terror and de&s;truction.</P>
<P>As all of this kind live entirely in waters, and among watery
places, they &s;eem provided by Nature with a warmth of con&s;titution to fit
them for that cold element. They re&s;ide, by choice, in the colde&s;t
climates; and as other birds migrate here in our &s;ummer, their mi|grations
hither are mo&s;tly in the winter. Even tho&s;e that re&s;ide among us the
whole &s;ea&s;on, retire in &s;ummer to the tops of our bleake&s;t mountains;
where they breed, and bring down their young, when the cold weather &s;ets
in.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of them, however, migrate, and retire to the polar
regions; as tho&s;e that remain behind in the mountains, and keep with us
during &s;ummer, bear no proportion to the quantity which in winter haunt our
mar&s;hes and low grounds. The &s;nipe &s;ometimes builds here; and the ne&s;t
of the curlew is &s;ometimes found in the pla&s;hes of our hills: but the
number of the&s;e is very &s;mall; and it is mo&s;t probable that they are only
&s;ome &s;tragglers who, not having &s;trength or courage &s;ufficient for the
general voyage, take up from nece&s;&s;ity their habitation here.</P>
<P>In general, during &s;ummer, this whole cla&s;s 
<PB N="28" REF="35"> either chu&s;e the colde&s;t countries to retire to, or
the colde&s;t and the moi&s;te&s;t part of ours to breed in. The curlew, the
wood-cock, the &s;nipe, the godwit, the grey plover, the green, and the long
legged plover, the knot and the turn&s;tone, are rather the gue&s;ts than the
na|tives of this i&s;land. They vi&s;it us in the be|ginning of winter, and
for&s;ake us in the &s;pring. They then retire to the mountains of Sweden,
Poland, Pru&s;&s;ia, and Lapland, to breed. Our country, during the &s;ummer
&s;ea&s;on, becomes uninhabitable to them. The ground parched up by the heat;
the &s;prings dried away; and the vermicular in&s;ects already upon the wing;
they have no means of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting. Their weak and delicately pointed bills
are unfit to dig into a re&s;i&s;ting &s;oil; and their prey is departed,
though they were able to reach its retreats. Thus, that &s;ea&s;on when Nature
is &s;aid to teem with life, and to put on her gaye&s;t liveries, is to them an
interval of &s;terility and famine. The colde&s;t mountains of the north are
then a preferable habitation; the mar&s;hes there are never totally dried up;
and the in&s;ects are in &s;uch abundance, that, both above ground and
underneath, the country &s;warms with them. In &s;uch retreats, therefore,
the&s;e birds would continue always; but that the fro&s;ts, when 
<PB N="29" REF="36"> they &s;et in, have the &s;ame effect upon the face of the
land&s;cape, as the heats of &s;ummer. Every brook is &s;tiffened into ice; all
the earth is congealed into one &s;olid ma&s;s; and the birds are obliged to
for&s;ake a region where they can no longer find &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>Such are our vi&s;itants. With regard to tho&s;e which keep
with us continually, and breed here, they are neither &s;o delicate in their
food, nor perhaps &s;o warm in their con&s;titutions. The lapwing, the ruff,
the red|&s;hank, the &s;and-piper, the &s;ea-pie, the Nor|folk plover, and the
&s;ea-lark, breed in this country, and, for the mo&s;t part, re&s;ide here. In
&s;ummer they frequent &s;uch mar&s;hes as are not dried up in any part of the
year; the E&s;&s;ex hundreds, and the fens of Lincoln&s;hire. There, in
&s;olitudes formed by &s;urrounding mar&s;hes, they breed and bring up their
young. In win|ter they come down from their retreats, ren|dered uninhabitable
by the flooding of the waters; and &s;eek their food about our ditches and
mar&s;hly meadow-grounds. Yet even of this cla&s;s, all are wanderers upon
&s;ome occa|&s;ions; and take wing to the northern climates, to breed and find
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence. This happens when our &s;ummers are peculiarly dry; and when
the fenny countries are not &s;ufficiently watered to defend their
retreats.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="37">But though this be the u&s;ual cour&s;e of
na|ture, with re&s;pect to the&s;e birds, they often break through the general
habits of their kind; and as the lapwing, the ruff, and the &s;and-piper, are
&s;ometimes &s;een to alter their manners, and to migrate from hence, in&s;tead
of continuing to breed here; &s;o we often find the wood-cock, the &s;nipe and
the curlew, re&s;ide with us during the whole &s;ea&s;on, and breed their young
in dif|ferent parts of the country. In Ca&s;ewood, about two miles from
Tunbridge, as Mr. Pe|nant a&s;&s;ures us, &s;ome wood-cocks are &s;een to breed
annually. The young have been &s;hot there in the beginning of Augu&s;t; and
were as healthy and vigorous as they are with us in winter, though not &s;o
well ta&s;ted. On the Alps, and other high mountains, &s;ays Wil|loughby, the
wood-cock continues all &s;ummer. I my&s;elf have flu&s;hed them on the top of
Mount Jura, in June and July. The eggs are long, of a pale red colour, and
&s;tained with deeper &s;pots and clouds. The ne&s;ts of the curlew and the
&s;nipe are frequently found; and &s;ome of the&s;e perhaps never entirely
leave this i&s;land.</P>
<P>It is thus that the &s;ame habits are in &s;ome mea&s;ure
common to all; but in ne&s;tling, and bringing up their young, one method takes
place univer&s;ally. As they all run and feed <PB N="31" REF="38"> upon the
ground, &s;o they are all found to ne&s;tle there. The number of eggs generally
to be &s;een in every ne&s;t, is from two to four; never under, and very
&s;eldom exceeding. The ne&s;t is made without any art; but the eggs are either
laid in &s;ome little depre&s;&s;ion of the earth, or on a few bents and long
gra&s;s, that &s;carcely pre|&s;erve them from the moi&s;ture below. Yet &s;uch
is the heat of the body of the&s;e birds, that their time of incubation is
&s;horter than with any others of the &s;ame &s;ize. The magpie, for
in|&s;tance, takes twenty-one days to hatch its young; the lapwing takes but
fourteen. Whether the animal oil, with which the&s;e birds abound, gives them
this &s;uperior warmth, I cannot tell; but there is no doubt of their quick
incubation.</P>
<P>In their &s;ea&s;ons of court&s;hip, they pair as other birds;
but not without violent conte&s;ts between the males, for the choice of the
fe|male. The lapwing and the plover are often &s;een to fight among
them&s;elves; but there is one little bird of this tribe, called the ruff, that
has got the epithet of the fighter, merely from its great per&s;everance and
animo&s;ity on the&s;e occa&s;ions. In the beginning of &s;pring, when the&s;e
birds arrive among our mar&s;hes, they are ob&s;erved to engage with
de&s;perate fury again&s;t each other; it is then that the fowlers, 
<PB N="32" REF="39"> &s;eeing them intent on mutual de&s;truction, &s;pread
their nets over them, and take them in great numbers. Yet even in captivity
their animo&s;ity &s;till continues: the people that fat them up for &s;ale,
are obliged to &s;hut them up in clo&s;e dark rooms; for if they let ever &s;o
little light in among them, the turbulent pri|&s;oners in&s;tantly fall to
fighting with each other, and never cea&s;e till each has killed its
anta|goni&s;t, e&s;pecially, &s;ays Willoughby, if any body &s;tands by. A
&s;imilar animo&s;ity, though in a le&s;s degree, prompts all this tribe; but
when they have paired, and begun to lay, their contentions are then over.</P>
<P>The place the&s;e birds chiefly chu&s;e to breed in, is in
&s;ome i&s;land &s;urrounded with &s;edgy moors, where men &s;eldom re&s;ort;
and in &s;uch &s;ituations I have often &s;een the ground &s;o &s;trewed with
eggs and ne&s;ts, that one could &s;carce take a &s;tep, without treading upon
&s;ome of them. As &s;oon as a &s;tranger intrudes upon the&s;e retreats, the
whole colony is up, and an hundred different &s;creams are heard from every
quarter. The arts of the lapwing to allure men or dogs from her ne&s;t, are
perfectly amu&s;ing. When &s;he perceives the enemy approaching, &s;he never
waits till they arrive at her ne&s;t, but boldly runs to meet them: when &s;he
has come <PB N="33" REF="40"> as near them as &s;he dares to venture, &s;he
then ri&s;es with a loud &s;creaming before them, &s;eem|ing as if &s;he were
ju&s;t flu&s;hed from hatching; while &s;he is then probably a hundred yards
from the ne&s;t. Thus &s;he flies, with great clamour and anxiety, whining and
&s;creaming round the invaders, &s;triking at them with her wings, and
fluttering as if &s;he were wounded. To add to the deceit, &s;he appears
&s;till more clamorous, as more remote from the ne&s;t. If &s;he &s;ees them
very near, &s;he then &s;eems to be quite unconcerned, and her cries cea&s;e,
while her ter|rors are really augmenting. If there be dogs, &s;he flies heavily
at a little di&s;tance before them, as if maimed; &s;till vociferous and
&s;till bold, but never offering to move towards the quarter where her
trea&s;ure is depo&s;ited. The dog pur&s;ues, in hopes every moment of
&s;eizing the parent, and by this means actually lo&s;es the young; for the
cunning bird, when &s;he has thus drawn him off to a proper di&s;tance, then
puts forth her powers, and leaves her a&s;toni&s;hed pur&s;uer to gaze at the
rapidity of her flight. The eggs of all the&s;e birds are highly valued by the
lux|urious; they are boiled hard, and thus &s;erved up, without any further
preparation.</P>
<P>As the young of this cla&s;s are &s;oon hatched, &s;o, when
excluded, they quickly arrive at ma|turity. <PB N="34" REF="41"> They run about
after the mother as &s;oon as they leave the egg; and being covered with a
thick down, want very little of that clutching which all birds of the poultry
kind, that follow the mother indi&s;pen&s;ably require. They come to their
adult &s;tate long before winter; and then flock together, till the breed|ing
&s;ea&s;on returns, which for a while di&s;&s;olves their &s;ociety.</P>
<P>As the fle&s;h of almo&s;t all the&s;e birds is in high
e&s;timation, &s;o many methods have been contrived for taking them. That
u&s;ed in taking the ruff, &s;eems to be the mo&s;t advan|tageous; and it may
not be ami&s;s to de&s;cribe it. The Ruff, which is the name of the male, the
Reeve that of the female, is taken in nets about forty yards long, and &s;even
or eight feet high. The&s;e birds are chiefly found in Lincoln&s;hire and the
I&s;le of Ely, where they come about the latter end of April, and di&s;|appear
about Michaelmas. The male of this bird, which is known from all others of the
kind by the great length of the feathers round his neck, is yet &s;o various in
his plumage, that it is &s;aid, no two ruffs were ever &s;een totally of the
&s;ame colour. The nets in which the&s;e are taken, are &s;upported by
&s;ticks, at an angle of near forty-five degrees, and placed either on 
<PB N="35" REF="42"> dry ground, or in very &s;hallow water, not re|mote from
reeds: among the&s;e the fowler conceals him&s;elf, till the birds, enticed by
a &s;tale or &s;tuffed bird, come under the nets: he then, by pulling a
&s;tring, lets them fall, and they are taken; as are godwits, knots and grey
plover, al&s;o in the &s;ame manner. When the&s;e birds are brought from under
the net, they are not killed immediately, but fattened for the table, with
bread and milk, hemp-&s;eed, and &s;ometimes boiled wheat; but if expe|dition
be wanted, &s;ugar is added, which will make them a lump of fat in a
fortnight's time. They are kept, as ob&s;erved before, in a dark room; and
judgment is required in taking the proper time for killing them, when they are
at the highe&s;t pitch of fatne&s;s; for, if that is neglected, the birds are
apt to fall away. They are reckoned a very great delicacy; they &s;ell for two
&s;hillings, or half a crown a piece; and are &s;erved up to the table with the
train, like wood-cocks, where we will leave them.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. Of the Water-hen and the Coot.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE we enter upon water-fowls, pro|perly &s;o called, two
or three birds claim our attention, which &s;eem to form the &s;hade be|tween
the web-footed tribe and tho&s;e of the crane kind. The&s;e partake rather of
the form than the habits of the crane; and, though fur|ni&s;hed with long legs
and necks, rather &s;wim than wade. They cannot properly be called web-footed;
nor yet are they entirely de&s;titute of membranes, which fringe their toes on
each &s;ide, and adapt them for &s;wimming. The birds in que&s;tion are, the
Water-hen, and the Bald Coot.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds have too near an affinity, not to be ranked in
the &s;ame de&s;cription. They are &s;haped entirely alike, their legs are
long, and their thighs partly bare; their necks are propor|tionable, their
wings &s;hort, their bills &s;hort and weak, their colour black, their
foreheads bald and without feathers, and their habits entirely the &s;ame.
The&s;e, however, naturali&s;ts have thought proper to range in different
cla&s;&s;es, from very &s;light di&s;tinctions in their <PB N="37" REF="44">
figure. The water-hen weighs but fifteen ounces; the coot twenty-four. The bald
part of the forehead in the coot is black; in the water-hen it is of a
beautiful pink colour. The toes of the water-hen are edged with a &s;traight
membrane; tho&s;e of the coot have it &s;colloped and broader.</P>
<P>The differences in the figure are but &s;light; and tho&s;e in
their manner of living &s;till le&s;s. The hi&s;tory of the one will &s;erve
for both. As birds of the crane kind are furni&s;hed with long wings, and
ea&s;ily change place, the water-hen, who&s;e wings are &s;hort, is obliged to
re&s;ide en|tirely near tho&s;e places where her food lies: &s;he cannot take
tho&s;e long journeys that mo&s;t of the crane kind are &s;een to perform;
com|pelled by her natural imperfections, as well perhaps as by inclination,
&s;he never leaves the &s;ide of the pond or the river in which &s;he &s;eeks
for provi&s;ion. Where the &s;tream is &s;elvaged with &s;edges, or the pond
edged with &s;hrubby trees, the water-hen is generally a re&s;ident there:
&s;he &s;eeks her food along the gra&s;&s;y banks; and often along the
&s;urface of the water. With Shake|&s;pear's Edgar, &s;he drinks the green
mantle of the &s;tanding pool; or, at lea&s;t, &s;eems to prefer tho&s;e places
where it is &s;een. Whether &s;he makes pond-weed her food, or hunts among it 
<PB N="38" REF="45"> for water-in&s;ects, which are found there in great
abundance, is not certain. I have &s;een them when pond-weed was taken out of
their &s;tomach. She builds her ne&s;t upon low trees and &s;hrubs, of &s;ticks
and fibres, by the water &s;ide. Her eggs are &s;harp at one end, white, with a
tincture of green &s;potted with red. She lays twice or thrice in a &s;ummer;
her young ones &s;wim the moment they leave the egg, pur&s;ue their parent, and
imitate all her manners. She rears, in this manner, two or three broods in a
&s;ea&s;on; and when the young are grown up, &s;he drives them off to &s;hift
for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>As the coot is a larger bird, it is always &s;een in larger
&s;treams, and more remote from man|kind. The water-hen &s;eems to prefer
inhabited &s;ituations: &s;he keeps near ponds, motes, and pools of water near
gentlemen's hou&s;es; but the coot keeps in rivers, and among ru&s;hy margined
lakes. It there makes a ne&s;t of &s;uch weeds as the &s;tream &s;upplies, and
lays them among the reeds, floating on the &s;urface, and ri&s;ing and falling
with the water. The reeds among which it is built keep it fa&s;t; &s;o that it
is &s;eldom wa&s;hed into the middle of the &s;tream. But if this happens,
which is &s;ometimes the ca&s;e, the bird &s;its in her ne&s;t, like a mariner
in his boat, and &s;teers with her legs her cargo into <PB N="39" REF="46"> the
neare&s;t harbour: there, having attained her port, &s;he continues to &s;it in
great tranquility, regardle&s;s of the impetuo&s;ity of the current; and though
the water penetrates her ne&s;t, &s;he hatches her eggs in that wet
condition.</P>
<P>The water-hen never wanders; but the coot &s;ometimes &s;wims
down the current, till it even reaches the &s;ea. In this voyage the&s;e birds
en|counter a thou&s;and dangers: as they cannot fly far, they are hunted by
dogs and men; as they never leave the &s;tream, they are attacked and
de&s;troyed by otters; they are preyed upon by kites and falcons; and they are
taken, in &s;till greater numbers, in weirs made for catching fi&s;h; for
the&s;e birds are led into the nets, while pur&s;uing &s;mall fi&s;h and
in&s;ects, which are their principal food. Thus animated nature affords a
picture of univer&s;al inva&s;ion! Man de&s;troys the otter, the otter
de&s;troys the coot, the coot feeds upon fi&s;h, and fi&s;h are univer&s;ally
the tyrants of each other!</P>
<P>To the&s;e birds, with long legs and finny toes, I will add
one &s;pecies more, with &s;hort legs and finny toes: I mean the Grebe. The
entire re&s;emblance of this bird's appetites and manners to tho&s;e of the
web-footed cla&s;s, might ju&s;tly induce me to rank it among them; but as it
re&s;embles tho&s;e above de&s;cribed, in the pe|culiar <PB N="40" REF="47">
form of its toes, and bears &s;ome &s;imi|litude in its manners al&s;o, I will
for once &s;a|crifice method to brevity. The grebe is much larger than either
of the former, and its plumage white and black: it differs al&s;o entirely in
the &s;hortne&s;s of its legs, which are made for &s;wim|ming, and not walking:
in fact, they are from the knee upward hid in the belly of the bird, and have
con&s;equently very little motion. By this mark, and by the &s;colloped fringe
of the toes, may this bird be ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed from all others.</P>
<P>As they are thus, from the &s;hortne&s;s of their wings, ill
formed for flying, and from the un|common &s;hortne&s;s of their legs, utterly
unfitted for walking, they &s;eldom leave the water, and chiefly frequent
tho&s;e broad &s;hallow pools where their faculty of &s;wimming can be turned
to the greate&s;t advantage, in fi&s;hing and &s;eeking their prey.</P>
<P>They are chiefly, in this country, &s;een to frequent the
meres of Shrop&s;hire and Che&s;hire; where they breed among reeds and flags,
in a floating ne&s;t, kept &s;teady by the weeds of the margin The female is
&s;aid to be a careful nur&s;e of its young, being ob&s;erved to feed them
mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly with &s;mall eels; and when the little brood is tired,
the mother <PB N="41" REF="48"> will carry them, either on her back or under
her wings. This bird preys upon fi&s;h, and is almo&s;t perpetually diving. It
does not &s;hew much more than the head above water; and is very difficult to
be &s;hot, as it darts down on the appearance of the lea&s;t danger. It is
never &s;een on land; and, though di&s;turbed ever &s;o often, will not leave
that lake where alone, by diving and &s;wimming, it can find food and
&s;ecurity. It is chiefly &s;ought for the &s;kin of its brea&s;t, the plumage
of which is of a mo&s;t beautiful &s;ilvery white, and as glo&s;&s;y as
&s;atin. This part is made into tippets; but the &s;kins are out of &s;ea&s;on
about February, lo&s;ing their bright colour; and in breeding-time their
brea&s;ts are entirely bare.</P>

<HEAD>PART VI. OF WATER-FOWL.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="45" REF="50">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of Water-fowl in General.</HEAD>
<P>IN &s;ettling the di&s;tinctions among the other cla&s;&s;es
of birds, there was &s;ome difficulty; one tribe encroached &s;o nearly upon
the nature and habitudes of another, that it was not ea&s;y to draw the line
which kept them a&s;under: but in water-fowl Nature has marked them for us by a
variety of indelible characters; &s;o that it would be almo&s;t as unlikely to
mi&s;take a land-fowl for one adapted for living and &s;wimming among the
waters, as a fi&s;h for a bird.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t great di&s;tinction in this cla&s;s, ap|pears in
the toes, which are webbed together for &s;wimming. Tho&s;e who have remarked
the feet or toes of a duck, will ea&s;ily conceive how admirably they are
formed for making way in the water. When men &s;wim they do not open the
fingers, &s;o as to let the fluid pa&s;s through them; but clo&s;ing them
together, pre&s;ent one broad &s;urface to beat back the water, and thus pu&s;h
their bodies along. What man performs by art, Nature has &s;upplied to
water-fowl; and, by broad &s;kins, has web|bed their toes together, &s;o that
they expand <PB N="46" REF="51"> two broad oars to the water; and thus, moving
them alternately, with the greate&s;t ea&s;e paddle along. We mu&s;t ob&s;erve
al&s;o, that the toes are &s;o contrived, that as they &s;trike backward, their
broade&s;t hollow &s;urface beats the water; but as they gather them in again,
for a &s;econd blow, their front &s;urface contracts, and does not impede the
bird's progre&s;&s;ive motion.</P>
<P>As their toes are webbed in the mo&s;t conve|nient manner,
&s;o are their legs al&s;o made mo&s;t fitly for &s;wift proge&s;&s;ion in the
water. The legs of all are &s;hort, except the three birds de&s;cribed in a
former chapter; namely, the flamingo, the avo&s;etta, and the corrira: all
which, for that rea&s;on, I have thought proper to rank among the crane kind,
as they make little u&s;e of their toes in &s;wimming. Except the&s;e, all
web-footed birds have very &s;hort legs; and the&s;e &s;trike, while they
&s;wim, with greater facility. Were the leg long, it would act like a lever
who&s;e prop is placed to a di&s;advantage; its motions would be &s;low, and
the labour of moving it con&s;iderable. For this rea&s;on, the very few birds
who&s;e webbed feet are long, never make u&s;e of them in &s;wimming: the web
at the bottom &s;eems only of &s;ervice as a broad ba&s;e, to prevent them from
&s;inking while they walk in the mud; but <PB N="47" REF="52"> it otherwi&s;e
rather retards than advances their motion.</P>
<P>The &s;hortne&s;s of the legs in the web-footed kinds, renders
them as unfit for walking on land, as it qualifies them for &s;wimming in their
natural element. Their &s;tay, therefore, upon land, is but &s;hort and
tran&s;itory; and they &s;eldom venture to breed far from the &s;ides of
tho&s;e waters where they u&s;ually remain. In their breeding &s;ea&s;ons,
their young are brought up by the water-&s;ide; and they are covered with a
warm down, to fit them for the cold|ne&s;s of their &s;ituation. The old ones
al&s;o have a clo&s;er, warmer plumage, than birds of any other cla&s;s. It is
of their feathers that our beds are compo&s;ed; as they neither mat nor imbibe
humidity, but are furni&s;hed with an animal-oil, that glazes their furface,
and keeps each &s;eparate. In &s;ome, however, this animal-oil is in too great
abundance; and is as offen&s;ive from its &s;mell as it is &s;erviceable for
the pur|po&s;es of hou&s;ehold oeconomy. The feathers, therefore, of all the
penguin kind, are totally u&s;ele&s;s for dome&s;tic purpo&s;es; as neither
boiling nor bleaching can dive&s;t them of their oily rancidity. Indeed, the
rancidity of all new feathers, of whatever water-fowl they be, is &s;o
di&s;gu&s;ting, that our uphol&s;terers give near <PB N="48" REF="53"> double
the price for old feathers that they af|ford for new: to be free from &s;mell,
they mu&s;t all be lain upon for &s;ome time; and their u&s;ual method is to
mix the new and the old together.</P>
<P>This quantity of oil, with which mo&s;t water-fowl are
&s;upplied, contributes al&s;o to their warmth in the moi&s;t element where
they re&s;ide. Their &s;kin is generally lined with fat; &s;o that, with the
warmth of the feathers externally, and this natural lining more internally,
they are better defended again&s;t the changes or the inclemencies of the
weather, than any other cla&s;s whatever.</P>
<P>As, among land-birds, there are &s;ome found fitted entirely
for depredation, and others for an harmle&s;s method of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting upon
vege|tables, &s;o al&s;o among the&s;e birds there are tribes of plunderers,
that prey, not only upon fi&s;h, but &s;ometimes upon water-fowl them&s;elves.
There are likewi&s;e more inoffen&s;ive tribes, that live upon in&s;ects and
vegetables only. Some water-fowls &s;ub&s;i&s;t by making &s;udden &s;toops
from above, to &s;eize whatever fi&s;h come near the &s;urface; others again,
not furni&s;hed with wings long enough to fit them for flight, take their prey
by diving after it to the bottom.</P>
<P>From hence all water-fowl naturally fall into three
di&s;tinctions. Tho&s;e of the Gull kind, that, <PB N="49" REF="54"> with long
legs and round bills, fly along the &s;ur|face to &s;eize their prey. Tho&s;e
of the Penguin kind, that, with round bills, legs hid in the abdomen, and
&s;hort wings, dive after their prey: and thirdly; tho&s;e of the Goo&s;e kind,
with flat broad bills, that lead harmle&s;s lives, and chiefly &s;ub&s;i&s;t
upon in&s;ects and vegetables.</P>
<P>The&s;e are not &s;peculative di&s;tinctions, made up for the
arrangement of a &s;y&s;tem; but they are &s;trongly and evidently marked by
Nature. The Gull kind are active and rapacious; con|&s;tantly, except when they
breed, keeping upon the wing; fitted for a life of rapine, with &s;harp
&s;traight bills for piercing, or hooked at the end for holding their fi&s;hy
prey. In this cla&s;s we may rank the Albatro&s;s, the Cormorant, the Gannet or
Soland Goo&s;e, the Shag, the Frigate Bird, the Great Brown Gull, and all the
le&s;&s;er tribe of gulls and &s;ea-&s;wallows.</P>
<P>The Penguin kind, with appetites as vora|cious, bills as
&s;harp, and equally eager for prey, are yet unqualified to obtain it by
flight. Their wings are &s;hort, and their bodies large and heavy, &s;o that
they can neither run nor fly. But they are formed for diving in a very peculiar
manner. Their feet are placed &s;o far backward, and their legs &s;o hid in the
abdomen, <PB N="50" REF="55"> that the &s;lighte&s;t &s;troke &s;ends them head
fore|mo&s;t to the bottom of the water. To this cla&s;s we may refer the
Penguin, the Auk, the Skout, the Sea-turtle, the Bottle-no&s;e and the
Loon.</P>
<P>The Goo&s;e kind are ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hable, by their
flat broad bills, covered with a &s;kin; and their manner of feeding, which is
mo&s;tly upon vegetables. In this cla&s;s we may place the Swan, the Goo&s;e,
the Duck, the Teal, the Widgeon, and all their numerous varieties.</P>
<P>In de&s;cribing the birds of the&s;e three cla&s;&s;es, I will
put the mo&s;t remarkable of each cla&s;s at the beginning of their
re&s;pective tribes, and give their &s;eparate hi&s;tory: then, after having
de&s;cribed the chiefs of the tribe, the more or|dinary &s;orts will naturally
fall in a body, and come under a general de&s;cription, behind their leaders.
But before I offer to pur&s;ue this me|thodical arrangement, I mu&s;t give the
hi&s;tory of a bird that, from the &s;ingularity of its conformation, &s;eems
allied to no &s;pecies; and &s;hould therefore be &s;eparately de&s;cribed. I
mean the Pelican.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the Pelican.</HEAD>
<P>THE Pelican of Africa is much larger in the body than a
&s;wan, and &s;omewhat of the &s;ame &s;hape and colour. Its four toes are all
webbed together; and its neck in &s;ome mea&s;ure re|&s;embles that of a
&s;wan: but that &s;ingularity in which it differs from all other birds is in
the bill and the great pouch underneath, which are wonderful, and demand a
di&s;tinct de&s;cription. This enormous bill is fifteen inches from the point
to the opening of the mouth, which is a good way back behind the eyes. At the
ba&s;e the bill is &s;omewhat greeni&s;h, but varies to|wards the end, being of
a reddi&s;h blue. It is very thick in the beginning, but tapers off to the end,
where it hooks downwards. The under-chap is &s;till more extraordinary; for to
the lower edges of it hang a bag, reaching the whole length of the bill to the
neck, which is &s;aid to be capable of containing fifteen quarts of water. This
bag the bird has a power of wrinkling up into the hollow of the under|chap; but
by opening the bill, and putting <PB REF="58">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"> <PB N="51" REF="59">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"> <PB N="52" REF="60"> one's hand
down into the bag, it may be di|&s;tended at plea&s;ure. The &s;kin of which it
is formed will then be &s;een of a blui&s;h a&s;h-colour, with many fibres and
veins running over its &s;ur|face. It is not covered with feathers, but a
&s;hort downy &s;ub&s;tance as &s;mooth and as &s;oft as &s;atin, and is
attached all along the under edges of the chap, to be fixed backward to the
neck of the bird by proper ligaments, and reaches near half way down. When this
bag is empty it is not &s;een; but when the bird has fi&s;hed with &s;ucce&s;s,
it is then incredible to what an extent it is often &s;een dilated. For the
fir&s;t thing the pelican does in fi&s;hing is to fill up the bag; and then it
returns to dige&s;t its burthen at lei&s;ure. When the bill is opened to its
wide&s;t extent, a per&s;on may run his head into the bird's mouth, and conceal
it in this mon&s;trous pouch, thus adapted for very &s;ingular purpo&s;es. Yet
this is nothing to what Ruy&s;ch a&s;&s;ures us, who avers that a man has been
&s;een to hide his whole leg, boot and all, in the mon&s;trous jaws of one of
the&s;e animals. At fir&s;t appearance this would &s;eem impo&s;&s;ible, as the
&s;ides of the under chap, from which the bag depends, are not above an inch
a&s;under when the bird's bill is fir&s;t opened; but then they are capable of
great &s;eparation; and it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be &s;o <PB N="53" REF="61">
as the bird preys upon the large&s;t fi&s;hes, and hides them by dozens in its
pouch. Tertre affirms that it will hide as many fi&s;h as will &s;erve &s;ixty
hungry men for a meal.</P>
<P>Such is the formation of this extraordinary bird, which is a
native of Africa and America. The pelican was once al&s;o known in Europe,
particularly in Ru&s;&s;ia; but it &s;eems to have de|&s;erted our coa&s;ts.
This is the bird of which &s;o many fabulous accounts have been propagated;
&s;uch as its feeding its young with its own blood, and its carrying a
provi&s;ion of water for them in its great re&s;ervoir in the de&s;art. But the
ab|&s;urdity of the fir&s;t account an&s;wers it&s;elf; and as for the latter,
the pelican u&s;es its bag for very different purpo&s;es than that of filling
it with water.</P>
<P>Its amazing pouch may be con&s;idered as ana|logous to the
crop in other birds, with this dif|ference, that as theirs lies at the bottom
of the gullet, &s;o this is placed at the top. Thus, as pigeons and other birds
macerate their food for their young in their crops, and then &s;upply them,
&s;o the pelican &s;upplies its young by a more ready contrivance, and
macerates their food in its bill, or &s;tores it for its own particular
&s;u&s;tenance.</P>
<P>The ancients were particularly fond of giving 
<PB N="54" REF="62"> this bird admirable qualities and parental af|fections:
&s;truck, perhaps, with its extraordinary figure, they were willing to &s;upply
it with as extraordinary appetites; and having found it with a large
re&s;ervoir, they were plea&s;ed with turning it to the mo&s;t tender and
parental u&s;es. But the truth is, the pelican is a very heavy, &s;luggi&s;h,
voracious bird, and very ill fitted to take tho&s;e flights, or to make tho&s;e
cautious provi&s;ions for a di&s;tant time, which we have been told they do.
Father Labat, who &s;eems to have &s;tudied their manners with great
exact|ne&s;s, has given us a minute hi&s;tory of this bird, as found in
America; and from him I will borrow mine.</P>
<P>The pelican, &s;ays Labat, has &s;trong wings, furni&s;hed
with thick plumage of an a&s;h-colour, as are the re&s;t of the feathers over
the whole body. Its eyes are very &s;mall, when compared to the &s;ize of its
head; there is a &s;adne&s;s in its countenance, and its whole air is
melancholly. It is as dull and reluctant in its motions, as the flamingo is
&s;prightly and active. It is &s;low of flight; and when it ri&s;es to fly,
performs it with difficulty and labour. Nothing, as it would &s;eem, but the
&s;pur of nece&s;&s;ity, could make the&s;e birds change their &s;ituation, or
induce them to a&s;cend into the air: but they mu&s;t either &s;tarve or
fly.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="63">They are torpid and inactive to the la&s;t

it with unerring certainty, and &s;tore it up in their pouch. They then ri&s;e
again, though not with|out great labour, and continue hovering and fi&s;hing,
with their head on one &s;ide as before.</P>
<P>This work they continue with great effort and indu&s;try till
their bag is full, and then they fly to land to devour and dige&s;t at
lei&s;ure the fruits of their indu&s;try. This, however, it would appear they
are not long performing; for towards night they have another hungry call; and
they again reluctantly go to labour. At night, when their fi&s;hing is over,
and the toil of the day crowned with &s;ucce&s;s, the&s;e lazy birds retire a
little way from the &s;hore; and, though with the webbed feet and clum&s;y

&s;olemnity, and as it would &s;eem half a&s;leep. Their attitude is, with the
head re&s;ting upon their great bag, and that re&s;ting upon their brea&s;t.
There they remain without motion, or once changing their &s;ituation, till the
calls of hunger break their repo&s;e, and till they find it indi&s;pen&s;ibly

makes no preparation for her ne&s;t, nor &s;eems to chu&s;e any place in

five or &s;ix, and there continues to hatch them. At|tached to the place,
without any de&s;ire of de|fending her eggs or her young, &s;he tamely &s;its
and &s;uffers them to be taken from under her. Now and then &s;he ju&s;t
ventures to peck, or to cry out when a per&s;on offers to beat her off.</P>

Labat tells us that he took two of the&s;e when very young, and tied them by
the leg to a po&s;t &s;tuck into the ground, where he had the plea&s;ure of
&s;eeing the old one for &s;everal days come to feed them, remaining with them
the greate&s;t part of the day, and &s;pending the night on the branch of a
tree that hung over them. By the&s;e means they were all three become &s;o
familiar, that they &s;uffered them&s;elves to be handled; and the young ones
very kindly accepted whatever fi&s;h he offered them. The&s;e they always put

<P>It &s;eems, however, that they are but di&s;|agreeable and
u&s;ele&s;s dome&s;tics; their gluttony can &s;carcely be &s;atisfied; their
fle&s;h &s;mells very rancid; and ta&s;tes a thou&s;and times wor&s;e than it
&s;mells. The native Americans kill va&s;t numbers; not to eat, for they are
not fit even for the banquet of a &s;avage; but to convert their large bags
into pur&s;es and tobacco-pouches. They be&s;tow no &s;mall pains in
dre&s;s|ing the &s;kin with &s;alt and a&s;hes, rubbing it well with oil, and
then forming it to their purpo&s;e. It thus becomes &s;o &s;oft and pliant,

and embroidery to make work-bags of.</P>
<P>Yet, with all the &s;eeming hebetude of this bird, it is not
entirely incapable of in&s;truction in a dome&s;tic &s;tate. Father Raymond
a&s;&s;ures us, that he has &s;een one &s;o tame and well edu|cated among the
native Americans, that it would go off in the morning at the word of command,
and return before night to its ma&s;ter, with its great paunch di&s;tended with
plunder; a part of which the &s;avages would make it di&s;|gorge, and a part
they would permit it to re|&s;erve for it&s;elf.</P>

<Q REND="inline">"The Pelican," as Faber relates, "is not

Kind.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH this is one of the large&s;t and mo&s;t formidable
birds of Africa and America, yet we have but few accounts to enlighten us in
its hi&s;tory. The figure of the bird is thus de&s;cribed by Edwards. 
<Q REND="inline">"The body is rather larger than that of the
pelican; and its wings when extended ten feet from tip to tip. The bill, which
is &s;ix inches long, is yellowi&s;h, and terminates in a crooked point. The
top of the head is of a bright brown; the back is of a dirty deep &s;potted
brown; and the belly and under the wings is white; the toes, which are webbed,
are of a fle&s;h colour."</Q></P>
<P>Such are the principal traits in this bird's figure: but
the&s;e lead us a very &s;hort way in its hi&s;tory; and our naturali&s;ts have
thought fit to &s;ay nothing more. However, I am apt to believe this bird to be
the &s;ame with that de&s;cribed by Wicquefort, under the title of the
Alcatraz; its &s;ize, its colours, and its prey incline me to think &s;o. He
de&s;cribes it as a kind of great gull, as large in the body as a 
<PB N="61" REF="69"> goo&s;e, of a brown colour, with a long bill, and living
upon fi&s;h, of which they kill great numbers.</P>
<P>This bird is an inhabitant of the tropical cli|mates, and
al&s;o beyond them as far as the Streights of Magellan in the South Seas. It is
one of the mo&s;t fierce and formidable of the aquatic tribe, not only living
upon fi&s;h, but al&s;o &s;uch &s;mall water-fowl as it can take by &s;urprize.
It preys, as all the gull-kind do, upon the wing; and chiefly pur&s;ues the
flying-fi&s;h, that are forced from the &s;ea by the dolphins. The ocean in
that part of the world pre&s;ents a very different appearance from the &s;eas
with which we are &s;urrounded. In our &s;eas we &s;ee nothing but a dreary
expan&s;e, ruffled by winds, and &s;eemingly for|&s;aken by every cla&s;s of
animated nature. But the tropical &s;eas, and the di&s;tant &s;outhern
lati|tudes beyond them, are all alive with birds and fi&s;hes, pur&s;uing and
pur&s;ued. Every various &s;pecies of the gull-kind are there &s;een hovering
on the wing, at a thou&s;and miles di&s;tance from the &s;hore. The flying
fi&s;h are every moment ri&s;ing to e&s;cape from their pur&s;uers of the deep,
only to encounter equal dangers in the air. Ju&s;t as they ri&s;e the dolphin
is &s;een to dart after them, but generally in vain; the gull has more frequent
&s;ucce&s;s, and often takes them at their <PB N="62" REF="70"> ri&s;e; while
the albatro&s;s pur&s;ues the gull, and obliges it to relinqui&s;h its prey:
&s;o that the whole horizon pre&s;ents but one living picture of rapacity and
eva&s;ion.</P>
<P>So much is certain; but how far we are to credit Wicquefort,
in what he adds concern|ing this bird, the reader is left to determine 
<Q REND="inline">"As the&s;e birds, except when they breed,
live entirely remote from land, &s;o they are often &s;een, as it &s;hould
&s;eem, &s;leeping in the air. At night, when they are pre&s;&s;ed by
&s;lumber, they ri&s;e into the clouds as high as they can; there, putting
their head under one wing, they beat the air with the other, and &s;eem to take
their ea&s;e. After a time, however, the weight of their bodies, only thus half
&s;upported, brings them down; and they are &s;een de&s;cending, with a pretty
rapid motion, to the &s;urface of the &s;ea. Upon this they again put forth
their efforts to ri&s;e; and thus alternately a&s;cend and de&s;cend at their
ea&s;e. But it &s;ometimes happens," &s;ays my author, "that, in the&s;e
&s;lumbering flights, they are off their guard, and fall upon deck, where they
are taken."</Q></P>
<P>What truth there may be in this account, I will not take it
upon me to determine; but certain it is, that few birds float upon the air 
<PB N="63" REF="71"> with more ea&s;e than the albatro&s;s, or &s;upport
them&s;elves a longer time in that element. They &s;eem never to feel the
acce&s;&s;es of fatigue; but night and day upon the wing are always prowl|ing,
yet always emaciated and hungry.</P>
<P>But though this bird be one of the mo&s;t formidable tyrants
of the deep, there are &s;ome a&s;&s;ociations which even tyrants them&s;elves
form, to which they are induced either by caprice or nece&s;&s;ity. The
albatro&s;s &s;eems to have a pe|culiar affection for the penguin, and a
plea&s;ure in its &s;ociety. They are always &s;een to chu&s;e the &s;ame
places for breeding; &s;ome di&s;tant, unin|habited i&s;land, where the ground
&s;lants to the &s;ea, as the penguin is not formed either for flying or
climbing. In &s;uch places their ne&s;ts are &s;een together, as if they
&s;tood in need of mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance and protection. Captain Hunt, who
for &s;ome time commanded at our &s;ettle|ment upon Falkland I&s;lands,
a&s;&s;ures me, that he was often amazed at the union pre&s;erved between
the&s;e birds, and the regularity with which they built together. In that bleak
and de&s;olate &s;pot, where the birds had long con|tinued undi&s;turbed
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, and no way dreaded the encroachments of men, they &s;eemed
to make their abode as comfortable as they ex|pected it to be la&s;ting. They
were &s;een to <PB N="64" REF="72"> build with an amazing degree of uniformity;
their ne&s;ts covering fields by thou&s;ands, and re&s;embling a regular
plantation. In the middle, on high, the albatro&s;s rai&s;ed its ne&s;t, on
heath &s;ticks and long gra&s;s, about two feet above the &s;urface: round this
the penguins made their lower &s;ettlements, rather in holes in the ground; and
mo&s;t u&s;ually eight penguins to one alba|tro&s;s. Nothing is a &s;tronger
proof of Mr. Buffon's fine ob&s;ervation, that the pre&s;ence of man not only
de&s;troys the &s;ociety of meaner animals, but their in&s;tincts al&s;o.
The&s;e ne&s;ts are now, I am told, totally de&s;troyed; the &s;ociety is broke
up; and albatro&s;s and penguin have gone to breed upon more de&s;ert &s;hores,
in greater &s;ecurity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. The Cormorant.</HEAD>
<P>THE Cormorant is about the &s;ize of a large Mu&s;covy duck,
and may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from all other birds of this kind, by its four
toes being united by membranes together; and by the middle toe being toothed or
notched, like a &s;aw, to a&s;&s;i&s;t it in holding its fi&s;hy prey. The head
and neck of this bird are of a &s;ooty blackne&s;s; and the body thick and
heavy, more inclining in figure to that of the goo&s;e than the gull. The bill
is &s;traight, till near the end, where the upper chap bends into a hook.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding the &s;eeming heavine&s;s of its make,
there are few birds more powerfully predaceous. As &s;oon as the winter
approaches, they are &s;een di&s;per&s;ed along the &s;ea-&s;hore, and
a&s;cending up the mouths of fre&s;h-water rivers, carrying de&s;truction to
all the finny tribe. They are mo&s;t remarkably voracious, and have a mo&s;t
&s;udden dige&s;tion. Their appetite is for ever craving, and never
&s;atisfied. This gnaw|ing &s;en&s;ation may probably be encrea&s;ed by the
great quantity of &s;mall worms that fill their in|te&s;tines, and which their
uncea&s;ing gluttony contributes to engender.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="74">Thus formed with the gro&s;&s;e&s;t
appetites, this unclean bird has the mo&s;t rank and di&s;a|greeable &s;mell,
and is more foetid than even car|rion, when in its mo&s;t healthful &s;tate.
Its form, &s;ays an ingenious modern, is di&s;agreeable; its voice is hoar&s;e
and croaking; and all its qua|lities ob&s;cene. No wonder then that Milton
&s;hould make Satan per&s;onate this bird, when he &s;ent him upon the
ba&s;e&s;t purpo&s;es, to &s;urvey with pain the beauties of Paradi&s;e, and to
&s;it devi&s;ing death on the tree of life<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><BIBL>Vide
Penant's Zoology, p. 477.</BIBL></NOTE>. It has been remarked, however, of our
poet, that the making a water-fowl perch on a tree, im|plied no great
acquaintance with the hi&s;tory of nature. In vindication of Milton,
Ari&s;totle expre&s;sly &s;ays, that the cormorant is the only water-fowl that
&s;its on trees. We have already &s;een the pelican of this number; and the
cor|morant's toes &s;eem as fit for perching upon trees as for &s;wimming; &s;o
that our epic bard &s;eems to have been as deeply ver&s;ed in natural hi&s;tory
as in critici&s;m.</P>
<P>Indeed, this bird &s;eems to be of a multiform nature; and
wherever fi&s;h are to be found, watches their migrations. It is &s;een as well
by land as &s;ea; it fi&s;hes in fre&s;h-water lakes, as well as in the depths
of the ocean; it builds <PB N="67" REF="75"> in the cliffs of rocks, as well as
on trees; and preys not only in the day-time, but by night.</P>
<P>Its indefatigable nature, and its great power in catching
fi&s;h, were probably the motives that induced &s;ome nations to breed this
bird up tame, for the purpo&s;es of fi&s;hing; and Wil|loughby a&s;&s;ures us,
it was once u&s;ed in England for that purpo&s;e. The de&s;cription of their
man|ner of fi&s;hing is thus delivered by Faber. 
<Q REND="inline">"When they carry them out of the rooms where
they are kept, to the fi&s;h-pools, they hood-wink them, that they may not be
fright|ed by the way. When they are come to the rivers, they take off their
hoods; and having tied a leather thong round the lower part of their necks,
that they may not &s;wallow down the fi&s;h they catch, they throw them into
the river. They pre&s;ently dive under water; and there, for a long time, with
wonderful &s;wiftne&s;s, pur&s;ue the fi&s;h; and when they have caught them,
ri&s;e to the top of the water, and pre&s;&s;ing the fi&s;h lightly with their
bills, &s;wallow them; till each bird hath, after this manner, de|voured five
or &s;ix fi&s;hes. Then their keepers call them to the fi&s;t, to which they
readily fly; and, one after another, vomit up all their fi&s;h, a little
brui&s;ed with the fir&s;t nip <PB N="68" REF="76"> given in catching them.
When they have done fi&s;hing, &s;etting the birds on &s;ome high place, they
loo&s;e the &s;tring from their necks, leaving the pa&s;&s;age to the &s;tomach
free and open; and, for their reward, they throw them part of their prey; to
each one or two fi&s;hes, which they will catch mo&s;t dexterou&s;ly, as they
are falling in the air."</Q></P>
<P>At pre&s;ent, the cormorant is trained up in every part of
China for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, where there are many lakes and canals. 
<Q REND="inline">"To this end," &s;ays Le Comte, "they are
educated as men rear up &s;paniels or hawks; and one man can ea&s;ily manage an
hundred. The fi&s;her carries them out into the lake, perched on the gunnel of
his boat, where they con|tinue tranquil, and expecting his orders with
patience. When arrived at the proper place, at the fir&s;t &s;ignal given each
flies a different way, to fulfil the ta&s;k a&s;&s;igned it. It is very
plea&s;ant, on this occa&s;ion, to behold with what &s;agacity they portion out
the lake or the canal where they are upon duty. They hunt about, they plunge,
they ri&s;e an hun|dred times to the &s;urface, until they have at la&s;t found
their prey. They then &s;eize it with their beak by the middle, and carry it
without fail to their ma&s;ter. When the fi&s;h <PB N="69" REF="77"> is too
large, they then give each other mu|tual a&s;&s;i&s;tance: one &s;eizes it by
the head, the other by the tail, and in this manner carry it to the boat
together. There the boat-man &s;tretches out one of his long oars, on which
they perch, and being delivered of their bur|then, they fly off to pur&s;ue
their &s;port. When they are wearied, he lets them re&s;t for a while; but they
are never fed till their work is over. In this manner they &s;upply a very
plentiful table; but &s;till their natural gluttony cannot be reclaimed even by
education. They have always, while they fi&s;h, the &s;ame &s;tring fa&s;tened
round their throats, to prevent them from devouring their prey, as otherwi&s;e
they would at once &s;atiate them&s;elves, and di&s;continue their pur&s;uit
the moment they had filled their bellies."</Q></P>
<P>As for the re&s;t, the cormorant is the be&s;t fi&s;her of all
birds; and though fat and heavy with the quantity it devours, is neverthele&s;s
generally upon the wing. The great activity with which it pur&s;ues, and from a
va&s;t height drops down to dive after its prey, offers one of the mo&s;t
amu&s;ing &s;pectacles to tho&s;e who &s;tand upon a cliff on the &s;hore. This
large bird is &s;eldom &s;een in the air, but where there are fi&s;h below; but
then they mu&s;t be near the <PB N="70" REF="78"> &s;urface, before it will
venture to &s;ou&s;e upon them. If they are at a depth beyond what the impetus
of its flight makes the cormorant ca|pable of diving to, they certainly
e&s;cape him; for this bird cannot move &s;o fa&s;t under water, as the fi&s;h
can &s;wim. It &s;eldom, however, makes an un&s;ucce&s;sful dip; and is often
&s;een ri&s;ing heavily, with a fi&s;h larger than it can readily devour. It
&s;ometimes al&s;o happens, that the cormorant has caught the fi&s;h by the
tail; and con&s;equently the fins prevent its being ea&s;ily &s;wallowed in
that po&s;ition. In this ca&s;e, the bird is &s;een to to&s;s its prey above
its head, and very deterou&s;ly to catch it, when de&s;cending, by the proper
end, and &s;o &s;wallow it with ea&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. Of the Gannet or Soland Goo&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>THE Gannet is of the &s;ize of a tame goo&s;e, but its wings
much longer, being &s;ix feet over. The bill is &s;ix inches long, &s;traight
almo&s;t to the point, where it inclines down, and the &s;ides are irregularly
jagged, that it may hold its prey with greater &s;ecurity. It differs from the
cormorant in &s;ize, being larger; in its co|lour, which is chiefly white; and
by its having no no&s;trils, but in their place a long furrow that reaches
almo&s;t to the end of the bill. From the corner of the mouth is a narrow
&s;lip of black bare &s;kin, that extends to the hind part of the head; beneath
the &s;kin is another that, like the pouch of the pelican, is dilatable, and of
&s;ize &s;ufficient to contain five or &s;ix entire herrings, which in the
breeding &s;ea&s;on it carries at once to its mate or its young.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds, which &s;ub&s;i&s;t entirely upon fi&s;h,
chiefly re&s;ort to tho&s;e uninhabited i&s;lands where their food is found in
plenty, and men &s;eldom come to di&s;turb them. The i&s;lands to the north of
Scotland, the Skelig i&s;lands of the coa&s;ts of Kerry, in Ireland, and
tho&s;e <PB N="72" REF="80"> that lie in the north &s;ea off Norway, abound
with them. But it is on the Ba&s;s i&s;land, in the Firth of Edinburgh, where
they are &s;een in the greate&s;t abundance. 
<Q REND="inline">"There is a &s;mall i&s;land," &s;ays the
celebrated Harvey, "called the Ba&s;s, not more than a mile in circumference.
The &s;urface is almo&s;t wholly covered during the months of May and June with
their ne&s;ts, their eggs and young. It is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to walk
without treading on them: the flocks of birds upon the wing, are &s;o numerous,
as to darken the air like a cloud; and their noi&s;e is &s;uch, that one
cannot, without dif|ficulty, be heard by the per&s;on next to him. When one
looks down upon the &s;ea from the precipice, its whole &s;urface &s;eems
covered with infinite numbers of birds of different kinds, &s;wimming and
pur&s;uing their prey. If, in &s;ailing round the i&s;land, one &s;urveys its
hanging cliffs, in every crag or fi&s;&s;ure of the broken rocks, may be &s;een
innume|rable birds, of various &s;orts and &s;izes, more than the &s;tars of
heaven, when viewed in a &s;erene night. If they are viewed at a di&s;tance,
either receding, or in their approach to the i&s;land, they &s;eem like one
va&s;t &s;warm of bees."</Q></P>
<P>They are not le&s;s frequent upon the rocks 
<PB N="73" REF="81"> of St. Kilda. Martin a&s;&s;ures us, that the in|habitants
of that &s;mall i&s;land con&s;ume annually near twenty-three thou&s;and young
birds of this &s;pecies, be&s;ides an amazing quantity of their eggs. On
the&s;e they principally &s;ub&s;i&s;t through|out the year; and from the
number of the&s;e vi&s;itants, make an e&s;timate of their plenty for the
&s;ea&s;on. They pre&s;erve both the eggs and fowls in &s;mall pyramidal
&s;tone buildings, co|vering them with turf-a&s;hes, to prevent the evaporation
of their moi&s;ture.</P>
<P>The gannet is a bird of pa&s;&s;age. In winter it &s;eeks the
more &s;outhern coa&s;ts of Cornwall, hovering over the &s;hoals of herrings
and pil|chards that then come down from the northern &s;eas: its fir&s;t
appearance in the northern i&s;lands, is in the beginning of &s;pring; and it
con|tinues to breed till the end of &s;ummer. But, in general, its motions are
determined by the migrations of the immen&s;e &s;hoals of herrings that come
pouring down at that &s;ea&s;on through the Briti&s;h Channel, and &s;upply all
Europe as well as this bird with their &s;poil. The gannet a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly
attends the &s;hoal in their pa&s;&s;age, keeps with them in their whole
circuit round our i&s;land, and &s;hares with our fi&s;hermen this
exhau&s;tle&s;s banquet. As it is &s;trong of wing, it never comes near the
land; but is con&s;tant <PB N="74" REF="82"> to its prey. Wherever the gannet
is &s;een, it is &s;ure to announce to the fi&s;hermen the arrival of the finny
tribe; they then prepare their nets, and take the herrings by millions at a
draught; while the gannet, who came to give the fir&s;t informa|tion, comes,
though an unbidden gue&s;t, and often &s;natches its prey from the fi&s;herman
even in his boat. While the fi&s;hing &s;ea&s;on continues, the gannets are
bu&s;ily employed; but when the pilchards di&s;appear from our coa&s;ts, the
gannet takes its leave, to keep them company.</P>
<P>The cormorant has been remarked for the quickne&s;s of his
&s;ight; yet in this the gannet &s;eems to exceed him. It is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of a tran&s;parent membrane under the eye-lid, with which it covers the whole
eye at plea&s;ure, without ob&s;curing the &s;ight in the &s;malle&s;t de|gree.
This &s;eems a nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ion for the &s;ecurity of the eyes of &s;o
weighty a crea|ture, who&s;e method of taking prey, like that of the cormorant,
is by darting headlong down from an height of an hundred feet and more into the
water to &s;eize it. The&s;e birds are &s;ometimes taken at &s;ea, by
fa&s;tening a pilchard to a board, which they leave floating. The gannet
in&s;tantly pounces down from above upon the board, and is killed or maimed by
the &s;hock of a body where it expected no re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="83">The&s;e birds breed but once a year, and
lay but one egg, which being taken away, they lay another; if that is al&s;o
taken, then a third; but never more for that &s;ea&s;on. Their egg is white,
and rather le&s;s than that of the com|mon goo&s;e; and their ne&s;t large,
compo&s;ed of &s;uch &s;ub&s;tances as are found floating on the &s;urface of
the &s;ea. The young birds, during the fir&s;t year, differ greatly in colour
from the old ones; being of a du&s;ky hue, &s;peckled with numerous triangular
white &s;pots; and at that time re&s;embling the colours of the &s;peckled
diver.</P>
<P>The Ba&s;s I&s;land, where they chiefly breed, belongs to one
proprietor; &s;o that care is taken never to fright away the birds when laying,
or to &s;hoot them upon the wing. By that means, they are &s;o confident as to
alight and feed their young ones clo&s;e be&s;ide you. They feed only upon
fi&s;h, as was ob&s;erved; yet the young gannet is counted a great dainty by
the Scots, and &s;old very dear; &s;o that the lord of the i&s;let makes a
con&s;iderable annual profit by the &s;ale.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Of &s;maller Gulls and Petrels.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING de&s;cribed the manners of the great ones of this
tribe, tho&s;e of the &s;maller kinds may be ea&s;ily inferred. They re&s;emble
the more powerful in their appetites for prey, but have not &s;uch certain
methods of obtaining it. In general, therefore, the indu&s;try of this tribe
and their audacity encrea&s;e in proportion to their imbecility; the great
gulls live at the mo&s;t remote di&s;tance from man; the &s;maller are obliged
to re&s;ide wherever they can take their prey; and to come into the mo&s;t
populous places when &s;olitude can no longer grant them a &s;upply. In this
cla&s;s we may place the Gull, pro|perly &s;o called, of which there are above
twenty different kinds; the Petrel, of which there are three; and the Sea
&s;wallow, of which there are as many. The gulls may be di&s;tingui&s;hed by an
angular knob on the lower-chap; the petrels by their wanting this knob; and the
&s;ea-&s;wallow, by their bills, which are &s;traight, &s;lender, and &s;harp
pointed. They all, however, agree in their appetites and their places of
abode.</P>
<P>The gull, and all its varieties, is very well 
<PB N="77" REF="85"> known in every part of the kingdom. It is &s;een with a
&s;low-&s;ailing flight hovering over rivers to prey upon the &s;maller kinds
of fi&s;h; it is &s;een following the plowman in fallow fields to pick up
in&s;ects; and when living animal food does not offer, it has even been known
to eat car|rion and whatever el&s;e of the kind that offers. Gulls are found in
great plenty in every place; but it is chiefly round our bolde&s;t rockie&s;t
&s;hores that they are &s;een in the greate&s;t abun|dance; it is there that
the gull breeds and brings up its young; it is there that millions of them are
heard &s;creaming with di&s;cordant notes for months together.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have been much upon our coa&s;ts know that there
are two different kinds of &s;hores; that which &s;lants down to the water with
a gentle declivity, and that which ri&s;es with a precipitate boldne&s;s, and
&s;eems &s;et as a bulwark to repel the force of the invading deeps. It is to
&s;uch &s;hores as the&s;e that the whole tribe of the gull-kind re&s;ort, as
the rocks offer them a retreat for their young, and the &s;ea a &s;ufficient
&s;upply. It is in the cavities of the&s;e rocks, of which the &s;hore is
compo&s;ed, that the va&s;t variety of &s;ea-fowls retire to breed in fafety.
The waves beneath, that continually beat at the ba&s;e, often wear 
<PB N="78" REF="86"> the &s;hore into an impending boldne&s;s; &s;o that it
&s;eems to jut out over the water, while the raging of the &s;ea makes the
place inacce&s;&s;ible from below. The&s;e are the &s;ituations to which
&s;ea-fowl chiefly re&s;ort, and bring up their young in undi&s;turbed
&s;ecurity.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have never ob&s;erved our bolde&s;t coa&s;ts have
no idea of their tremendous &s;ubli|mity. The boa&s;ted works of art, the
highe&s;t towers, and the noble&s;t domes, are but ant-hills when put in
compari&s;on: the &s;ingle cavity of a rock often exhibits a coping higher than
the cieling of a gothic cathedral. The face of the &s;hore offers to the view a
wall of ma&s;&s;ive &s;tone ten times higher than our talle&s;t &s;teeples.
What &s;hould we think of a precipice three quarters of a mile in height; and
yet the rocks of St. Kilda are &s;till higher! What mu&s;t be our awe to
approach the edge of that impending height, and to look down on the
unfathomable vacuity below; to ponder on the terrors of falling to the bottom,
where the waves that &s;well like moun|tains are &s;carcely &s;een to curl on
the &s;urface, and the roar of an ocean a thou&s;and leagues broad appears
&s;ofter than the murmur of a brook! It is in the&s;e formidable man&s;ions
that myriads of &s;ea-fowls are for ever &s;een &s;porting, flying in
&s;ecurity down the depth, half a mile <PB N="79" REF="87"> beneath the feet of
the &s;pectator. The crow and the chough avoid tho&s;e frightful preci|pices;
they chu&s;e &s;maller heights, where they are le&s;s expo&s;ed to the
tempe&s;t; it is the cor|morant, the gannet, the tarrock, and the terne, that
venture to the&s;e dreadful retreats, and claim an undi&s;turbed
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. To the &s;pectator from above, tho&s;e birds, though &s;ome
of them are above the &s;ize of an eagle, &s;eem &s;carce as large as a
&s;wallow; and their loude&s;t &s;creaming is &s;carce perceptible.</P>
<P>But the generality of our &s;hores are not &s;o formidable.
Though they may ri&s;e two hun|dred fathom above the &s;urface, yet it often
happens that the water for&s;akes the &s;hore at the departure of the tide, and
leaves a noble and delightful walk for curio&s;ity on the beach. Not to mention
the variety of &s;hells with which the &s;and is &s;trewed, the lofty rocks
that hang over the &s;pectator's head, and that &s;eem but ju&s;t kept from
falling, produce in him no unplea&s;ing gloom. If to this be added the
fluttering, the &s;creaming, and the pur&s;uits of myriads of water-birds, all
either intent on the duties of incubation, or rouzed at the pre&s;ence of a
&s;tran|ger, nothing can compo&s;e a &s;cene of more pe|culiar &s;olemnity. To
walk along the &s;hore when the tide is departed, or to &s;it in the hollow 
<PB N="80" REF="88"> of a rock when it is come in, attentive to the various
&s;ounds that gather on every &s;ide, above and below, may rai&s;e the mind to
its highe&s;t and noble&s;t exertions. The &s;olemn roar of the waves
&s;welling into and &s;ub&s;iding from the va&s;t caverns beneath, the piercing
note of the gull, the frequent chatter of the guillemot, the loud note of the
auk, the &s;cream of the heron, and the hoar&s;e deep periodical croaking of
the cor|morant, all unite to furni&s;h out the grandeur of the &s;cene, and
turn the mind to him who is the E&s;&s;ence of all &s;ublimity.</P>
<P>Yet it often happens that the contemplation of a &s;ea-&s;hore
produces ideas of an humbler kind, yet &s;till not unplea&s;ing. The various
arts of the&s;e birds to &s;eize their prey, and &s;ome|times to elude their
pur&s;uers, their &s;ociety among each other, and their tenderne&s;s and care
of their young, produce gentler &s;en&s;ations. It is ridiculous al&s;o now and
then to &s;ee their various ways of impo&s;ing upon each other. It is common
enough, for in&s;tance, with the arctic gull, to pur&s;ue the le&s;&s;er gulls
&s;o long, that they drop their excrements through fear, which the hungry
hunter quickly gobbles up before it ever reaches the water. In breeding too
they have frequent conte&s;ts: one bird who has no ne&s;t of her own attempts
to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s another, <PB N="81" REF="89"> and put her&s;elf in the
place. This often hap|pens among all the gull-kind; and I have &s;een the poor
bird, thus di&s;placed by her more powerful invader, &s;it near the ne&s;t in
pen&s;ive di&s;content, while the other &s;eemed quite com|fortable in her new
habitation. Yet this place of pre-eminence is not ea&s;ily obtained; for the
in&s;tant the invader goes to &s;natch a moment|ary &s;u&s;tenance, the other
enters upon her own, and always ventures another battle be|fore &s;he
relinqui&s;hes the ju&s;tne&s;s of her claim. The contemplation of a cliff thus
covered with hatching-birds affords a very agreeable enter|tainment; and as
they &s;it upon the ledges of the rocks, one above another, with their white
brea&s;ts forward, the whole groupe has not un|aptly been compared to an
apothecary's &s;hop.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds, like all others of the rapacious kind, lay but
few eggs; and hence, in many places, their number is daily &s;een to
dimini&s;h. The le&s;&s;ening of &s;o many rapacious birds may, at fir&s;t
&s;ight, appear a benefit to mankind; but when we con&s;ider how many of the
na|tives of our i&s;lands are &s;u&s;tained by their fle&s;h, either fre&s;h or
&s;alted, we &s;hall find no &s;atisfac|tion in thinking that tho&s;e poor
people may in time lo&s;e their chief &s;upport. The gull in general, as was
&s;aid, builds on the ledges of <PB N="82" REF="90"> rocks, and lays from one
egg to three, in a ne&s;t formed of long gra&s;s and &s;ea-weed. Mo&s;t of the
kind are fi&s;hy ta&s;ted, with black &s;tringy fle&s;h; yet the young ones are
better food: and of the&s;e, with &s;everal other birds of the penguin kind,
the poor inhabitants of our northern i&s;lands make their wretched ban|quets.
They have been long u&s;ed to no other food; and even &s;alted gull can be
reli&s;hed by tho&s;e who know no better. Almo&s;t all delicacy is a relative
thing; and the man who repines at the luxuries of a well-&s;erved table,
&s;tarves not for want but from compari&s;on. The luxuries of the poor are
indeed coar&s;e to us, yet &s;till they are luxuries to tho&s;e ignorant of
better; and it is probable enough that a Kilda or a Feroe man may be found to
exi&s;t, outdoing Apicius him&s;elf, in con&s;ulting the plea&s;ures of the
table. Indeed, if it be true that &s;uch meat as is the mo&s;t dangerou&s;ly
earned is the &s;weete&s;t, no men can dine &s;o luxuriou&s;ly as the&s;e, as
none venture &s;o hardly in the pur|&s;uit of a dinner. In Jacob&s;on's
hi&s;tory of the Feroe I&s;lands, we have an account of the me|thod in which
tho&s;e birds are taken; and I will deliver it in his own &s;imple manner.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"It cannot be expre&s;&s;ed with what pains
and danger they take the&s;e birds in tho&s;e high &s;teep cliffs, whereof many
are two hundred fa|thoms <PB N="83" REF="91"> high. But there are men apt by
nature and fit for the work, who take them u&s;ually in two manners: they
either climb from below into the&s;e high promontories, that are as &s;teep as
a wall; or they let them&s;elves down with a rope from above. When they climb
from below, they have a pole five or &s;ix ells long, with an iron hook at the
end, which they that are below in the boat, or on the cliff, fa&s;ten unto the
man's girdle, helping him up thus to the highe&s;t place where he can get
footing: afterwards they al&s;o help up another man; and thus &s;everal climb
up as high as po&s;&s;ibly they can; and where they find diffi|culty, they help
each other up, by thru&s;ting one another up with their poles. When the fir&s;t
hath taken footing, he draws the other up to him, by the rope fa&s;tened to his
wa&s;te; and &s;o they proceed, till they come to the place where the birds
build. They there go about as well as they can, in tho&s;e dangerous places;
the one holding the rope at one end, and fixing him&s;elf to the rock; the
other going at the other end from place to place. If it &s;hould happen that he
chanceth to fall, the other that &s;tands firm keeps him up, and helps him up
again. But if he pa&s;&s;eth &s;afe, he likewi&s;e fa&s;tens him&s;elf till the
other has <PB N="84" REF="92"> pa&s;&s;ed the &s;ame dangerous place al&s;o.
Thus they go about the cliffs after birds as they plea&s;e. It often happeneth,
however, the more is the pity, that when one doth not &s;tand fa&s;t enough, or
is not &s;ufficiently &s;trong to hold up the other in his fall, that they both
fall down and are killed. In this man|ner &s;ome do peri&s;h every
year."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Peter Clan&s;on, in his de&s;cription of Norway, writeth,
that there was antiently a law in that country, that who&s;oever climbed &s;o
on the cliffs, that he fell down and died, if the body was found, before
burial, his next kin&s;|man &s;hould go the &s;ame way; but if he dur&s;t not
or could not do it, the dead body was not then to be buried in &s;anctified
earth, as the per&s;on was too full of temerity, and his own de&s;troyer.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"When the fowlers are come, in the man|ner
afore&s;aid, to the birds within the cliffs, where people &s;eldom come, the
birds are &s;o tame that they take them with their hands; for they will not
readily leave their young. But when they are wild, they ca&s;t a net, with
which they are provided, over them, and intangle them therein. In the mean
time, there lieth a boat beneath in the &s;ea, wherein they ca&s;t the birds
killed; and in this manner they can, in a &s;hort time, fill a 
<PB N="85" REF="93"> boat with fowl. When it is pretty fair weather, and there
is good fowling, the fowlers &s;tay in the cliffs &s;even or eight days
together; for there are here and there holes in the rocks, where they can
&s;afely re&s;t; and they have meat let down to them with a line from the top
of the mountain. In the mean time &s;ome go every day to them, to fetch home
what they have taken. 
<P> "Some rocks are &s;o difficult, that they can in no
manner get unto them from below; wherefore they &s;eek to come down thereunto
from above. For this purpo&s;e they have a rope, eighty or a hundred fathoms
long, made of hemp, and three fingers thick. The fowler maketh the end of this
fa&s;t about his wai&s;t, and between his legs, &s;o that he can &s;it thereon;
and is thus let down, with the fowling &s;taff in his hand. Six men hold by the
rope, and let him ea&s;ily down, laying a large piece of wood on the brink of
the rock, upon which the rope glideth, that it may not be worn to pieces by the
hard and rough edge of the &s;tone. They have be&s;ides, another &s;mall line,
that is fa&s;tened to the fowler's body; on which he pulleth, to give them
notice how they &s;hould let down the great rope, either lower or higher; or to
hold &s;till, <PB N="86" REF="94"> that he may &s;tay in the place whereunto he
is come. Here the man is in great danger, becau&s;e of the &s;tones that are
loo&s;ened from the cliff, by the &s;winging of the rope, and he cannot avoid
them. To remedy this, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, he hath u&s;ually on his head a
&s;eaman's thick and &s;haggy cap, which defends him from the blows of the
&s;tones, if they be not too big; and then it co&s;teth him his life:
neverthele&s;s, they continually put them&s;elves in that danger, for the
wretched body's food-&s;ake, hoping in God's mercy and protection, unto which
the greate&s;t part of them do de|voutly recommend them&s;elves when they go to
work: otherwi&s;e, they &s;ay, there is no other great danger in it, except
that it is a toil&s;ome and artificial labour; for he that hath not learned to
be &s;o let down, and is not u&s;ed thereto, is turned about with the rope,
&s;o that he &s;oon groweth giddy, and can do nothing; but he that hath learned
the art, con&s;iders it as a &s;port, &s;wings him&s;elf on the rope, &s;ets
his feet again&s;t the rock, ca&s;ts him&s;elf &s;ome fathoms from thence, and
&s;hoots him&s;elf to what place he will: he knows where the birds are, he
unde&s;tands how to &s;it on the line in the air, and how to hold the
fowling-&s;taff in his hand; &s;triking therewith <PB N="87" REF="95"> the
birds that come or fly away: and when there are holes in the rocks, and it
&s;tretches it&s;elf out, making underneath as a cieling, under which the birds
are, he knoweth how to &s;hoot him&s;elf in among them, and there take firm
footing. There, when he is in the&s;e holes, he maketh him&s;elf loo&s;e of the
rope, which he fa&s;tens to a crag of the rock, that it may not &s;lip from him
to the out&s;ide of the cliff. He then goes about in the rock, taking the fowl,
either with his hands or with the fowling-&s;taff. Thus, when he hath killed as
many birds as he thinks fit, he ties them in a bundle, and fa&s;tens them to a
little rope, giving a &s;ign, by pulling, that they &s;hould draw them up. When
he has wrought thus the whole day, and de&s;ires to get up again, he &s;itteth
once more upon the great rope, giving a new &s;ign, that they &s;hould pull him
up; or el&s;e he worketh him|&s;elf up, climbing along the rope, with his
girdle full of birds. It is al&s;o u&s;ual, where there are not folks enough to
hold the great rope, for the fowler to drive a po&s;t &s;loping into the earth,
and to make a rope fa&s;t thereto, by which he lets him&s;elf down, without any
body's help, to work in the manner afore|&s;aid. <PB N="88" REF="96"> Some
rocks are &s;o formed that the per&s;on can go into their cavities by land.</P>

<P> "The&s;e manners are more terrible and dan|gerous to
&s;ee than to de&s;cribe; e&s;pecially if one con&s;iders the &s;teepne&s;s and
height of the rocks, it &s;eeming impo&s;&s;ible for a man to approach them,
much le&s;s to climb or de|&s;cend. In &s;ome places, the fowlers are &s;een
climbing where they can only fa&s;ten the ends of their toes and fingers; not
&s;hunning &s;uch places, though there be an hundred fathom between them and
the &s;ea. It is a dear meat for the&s;e poor people, for which they mu&s;t
venture their lives; and many, after long venturing, do at la&s;t peri&s;h
therein.</P> 
<P> "When the fowl is brought home, a part thereof is eaten
fre&s;h; another part, when there is much taken, being hung up for winter
provi&s;ion. The feathers are gathered, to make merchandize of, for other
expences. The inhabitants get a great many of the&s;e fowls, as God giveth his
ble&s;&s;ing and fit wea|ther. When it is dark and hazy, they take mo&s;t; for
then the birds &s;tay in the rocks: but in clear weather, and hot
&s;un-&s;hine, they &s;eek the &s;ea. When they prepare to depart for the
&s;ea&s;on, they keep them&s;elves mo&s;t there, &s;itting on the clifts toward
the &s;ea|&s;ide, <PB N="89" REF="97"> where people get at them &s;ometimes
with boats, and take them with fowling|&s;taves."</P> </Q></P>
<P>Such is the account of this hi&s;torian; but we are not to
&s;uppo&s;e that all the birds caught in this manner, are of the gull kind: on
the contrary, numbers of them are of the penguin kind; auks, puffins and
guillemots. The&s;e all come, once a &s;ea&s;on, to breed in the&s;e
rece&s;&s;es; and retire in winter, to fi&s;h in more &s;outhern climates.</P>

<PB N="90" REF="98">
<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Of the Penguin Kind: and fir&s;t of the Great
Magellanic Penguin.</HEAD>
<P>THE gulls are long winged, &s;wift flyers, that hover over the
mo&s;t exten&s;ive &s;eas, and dart down upon &s;uch fi&s;h as approach too
near the &s;urface. The penguin kind are but ill fitted for flight, and &s;till
le&s;s for walking. Every body mu&s;t have &s;een the aukward manner in which a
duck, either wild or tame, attempts to change place: they mu&s;t recollect with
what &s;oft|ne&s;s and ea&s;e a gull or a kite waves its pinions, and with what
a coil and flutter the duck at|tempts to move them; how many &s;trokes it is
obliged to give, in order to gather a little air; and even when it is thus
rai&s;ed, how &s;oon it is fatigued with the force of its exertions, and
obliged to take re&s;t again. But the duck is not, in its natural &s;tate, half
&s;o unweildy an animal as the whole tribe of the penguin kind. Their wings are
much &s;horter, more &s;cantily fur|ni&s;hed with quills, and the whole pinion
placed too forward, to be u&s;efully employed. For this rea&s;on, the large&s;t
of the penguin kind, that have a thick, heavy body to rai&s;e, cannot 
<PB N="91" REF="99"> fly at all. Their wings &s;erve them rather as paddles to
help them forward, when they at|tempt to move &s;wiftly; and in a manner walk
along the &s;urface of the water. Even the &s;maller kinds &s;eldom fly by
choice; they flut|ter their wings with the &s;wifte&s;t efforts without making
way; and though they have but a &s;mall weight of body to &s;u&s;tain, yet they
&s;el|dom venture to quit the water where they are provided with food and
protection.</P>
<P>As the wings of the penguin tribe are un|fitted for flight,
their legs are &s;till more auk|wardly adapted for walking. This whole tribe
have all above the knee hid within the belly; and nothing appears but two
&s;hort legs, or feet, as &s;ome would call them, that &s;eem &s;tuck under the
rump, and upon which the animal is very aukwardly &s;upported. They &s;eem,
when &s;it|ing or attempting to walk, like a dog that has been taught to &s;it
up, or to move a minuet. Their &s;hort legs drive the body in progre&s;&s;ion
from &s;ide to &s;ide; and were they not a&s;&s;i&s;ted by their wings, they
could &s;carcely move fa&s;ter than a tortoi&s;e.</P>
<P>This aukward po&s;ition of the legs, which &s;o unqualifies
them for living upon land, adapts them admirably for a re&s;idence in water. In
that, the legs placed behind the moving body, <PB N="92" REF="100"> pu&s;hes it
forward with greater velocity; and the&s;e birds, like Indian canoes, are the
&s;wifte&s;t in the water, by having their paddles in the rear. Our &s;ailors,
for this rea&s;on, give the&s;e birds the very homely, but expre&s;&s;ive, name
of Ar&s;e-feet.</P>
<P>Nor are they le&s;s qualified for diving than &s;wimming. By
ever &s;o little inclining their bodies forward, they lo&s;e their center of
gravity; and every &s;troke from their feet only tends to &s;ink them the
fa&s;ter. In this manner they can either dive at once to the bottom, or &s;wim
between two waters; where they continue fi&s;hing for &s;ome minutes, and then
a&s;cending, catch an in&s;tantaneous breath, to de&s;cend once more to renew
their ope|rations. Hence it is that the&s;e birds, which are &s;o
defencele&s;s, and &s;o ea&s;ily taken by land, are impregnable by water. If
they perceive them&s;elves pur&s;ued in the lea&s;t, they in&s;tantly &s;ink,
and &s;hew nothing more than their bills, till the enemy is withdrawn. Their
very internal conformation a&s;&s;i&s;ts their power of keeping long under
water. Their lungs are fitted with numerous vacuities, by which they can take
in a very large in&s;piration; and this probably &s;erves them for a length of
time.</P>
<P>As they never vi&s;it land, except when they 
<PB N="93" REF="101"> come to breed, their feathers take a colour from their
&s;ituation. That part of them which has been continually bathed in the water,
is white; while their backs and wings are of different colours, according to
the different &s;pecies. They are al&s;o covered more warmly all over the body
with feathers, than any other birds whatever; &s;o that the &s;ea &s;eems
entirely their element; and but for the nece&s;&s;ary duties of propagating the
&s;pecies, we &s;hould &s;carcely have the &s;malle&s;t opportunity of &s;eeing
them, and &s;hould be utterly unacquainted with their hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Of all this tribe, the Magellanic Penguin is the large&s;t,
and the mo&s;t remarkable. In &s;ize it approaches near that of a tame goo&s;e.
It never flies, as its wings are very &s;hort, and covered with &s;tiff hard
feathers, and are always &s;een expanded, and hanging u&s;e|le&s;ly down by the
bird's &s;ides. The upper part of the head, back and rump, are covered with
&s;tiff, black feathers; while the belly and brea&s;t, as is common with all of
this kind, are of a &s;nowy whitene&s;s, except a line of black that is &s;een
to cro&s;s the crop. The bill, which from the ba&s;e to about half way is
covered with wrinkles, is black, but marked cro&s;swi&s;e with a &s;tripe of
yellow. They walk <PB N="94" REF="102"> erect with their heads on high, their
fin-like wings hanging down like arms; &s;o that to &s;ee them at a di&s;tance,
they look like &s;o many children with white aprons. From hence they are &s;aid
to unite in them&s;elves the qualities of men, fowls and fi&s;hes. Like men,
they are up|right; like fowls, they are feathered, and like fi&s;hes, they have
fin-like in&s;truments, that beat the water before, and &s;erve for all the
purpo&s;es of &s;wimming rather than flying.</P>
<P>They feed upon fi&s;h; and &s;eldom come a&s;hore, except in
the breeding-&s;ea&s;on. As the &s;eas in that part of the world abound with a
variety, they &s;eldom want food; and their extreme fatne&s;s &s;eems a proof
of the plenty in which they live. They dive with great rapidity, and are
voracious to a great degree. One of them, de&s;cribed by Clu&s;ius, though but
very young, would &s;wallow an entire herring at a mouthful, and often three
&s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively before it was appea&s;ed. In con&s;e|quence of this
gluttonous appetite, their fle&s;h is rank and fi&s;hy; though our &s;ailors
&s;ay, that <HI>it is pretty good eating.</HI> In &s;ome the fle&s;h is &s;o
tough, and the feathers &s;o thick, that they &s;tand the blow of a &s;cymitar
without injury.</P>
<P>They are a bird of &s;ociety; and e&s;pecially when they come
on &s;hore, they are &s;een drawn up <PB N="95" REF="103"> in rank and file,
upon the ledge of a rock, &s;tanding together with the albatro&s;s, as if in
con&s;ulation. This is previous to their lay|ing, which generally begins in
that part of the world in the month of November. Their preparations for laying
are attended with no great trouble, as a &s;mall depre&s;&s;ion in the earth,
without any other ne&s;t, &s;erves for this purpo&s;e. The warmth of their
feathers and the heat of their bodies is &s;uch, that the pro|gre&s;s of
incubation is carried on very rapidly.</P>
<P>But there is a difference in the manner of this bird's
ne&s;tling in other countries; which I can only a&s;cribe to the frequent
di&s;turbances it has received from man or quadrupedes in its rece&s;&s;es. In
&s;ome places, in&s;tead of content|ing it&s;elf with a &s;uperficial
depre&s;&s;ion in the ground, the penguin is found to burrow two or three yards
deep: in other places it is &s;een to for&s;ake the level, and to clamber up
the ledge of a rock, where it lays its egg, and hatches it in that bleak,
expo&s;ed &s;ituation. The&s;e precautions may probably have been taken, in
con&s;equence of dear bought expe|rience. In tho&s;e countries where the bird
fears for her own &s;afety, or that of her young, &s;he may providentially
provide again&s;t danger, by digging, or even by climbing; for both which &s;he
is but ill adapted by nature. In tho&s;e places, <PB N="96" REF="104"> however,
where the penguin has had but few vi&s;its from man, her ne&s;t is made, with
the mo&s;t confident &s;ecurity, in the middle of &s;ome large plain, where
they are &s;een by thou&s;ands. In that unguarded &s;ituation, neither
expecting nor fearing a powerful enemy, they continue to &s;it brooding; and
even when man comes among them, have at fir&s;t no apprehen&s;ion of their
danger. Some of this tribe have been called, by our &s;ea-men, the Booby, from
the total in&s;en&s;ibility which they &s;hew when they are &s;ought to their
de&s;truction. But it is not con&s;idered that the&s;e birds have never been
taught to know the dangers of an human enemy: it is again&s;t the fox or the
vulture that they have learned to defend them&s;elves; but they have no idea of
injury from a being &s;o very unlike their natural oppo&s;ers. The pen|guins,
therefore, when our &s;ea-men fir&s;t came among them, tamely &s;uffered
them&s;elves to be knocked on the head, without even attempting an e&s;cape.
They have &s;tood to be &s;hot at in flocks, without offering to move, in
&s;ilent won|der, till every one of their number has been de&s;troyed. Their
attachment to their ne&s;ts was &s;till more powerful; for the females tamely
&s;uffered the men to approach and take their eggs, without any re&s;i&s;tance.
But the expe|perience of a few of tho&s;e unfriendly vi&s;its, has 
<PB N="97" REF="105"> long &s;ince taught them to be more upon their guard in
chu&s;ing their &s;ituations; or to leave tho&s;e retreats where they were &s;o
little able to oppo&s;e their invaders.</P>
<P>The penguin lays but one egg; and, in fre|quented &s;hores, is
found to burrow like a rab|bit: &s;ometimes three or four take
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one hole, and hatch their young together. In the holes of
the rocks, where Nature has made them a retreat, &s;everal of this tribe, as
Linnaeus a&s;&s;ures us, are &s;een together. There the fe|males lay their
&s;ingle egg in a common ne&s;t, and &s;it upon this their general
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by turns; while one is placed as a centinel, to give warning
of approaching danger. The egg of the penguin, as well as of all this tribe, is
very large for the &s;ize of the bird, being generally found bigger than that
of a goo&s;e. But as there are many varieties of the penguin, and as they
differ in &s;ize, from that of a Mu&s;covy duck to a &s;wan, the eggs differ in
the &s;ame proportion.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. Of the Auk, Puffin, and other Birds of the
Penguin Kind.</HEAD>
<P>OF a &s;ize far inferior to the penguin, but with nearly the
&s;ame form, and exactly of the &s;ame appetites and manners, there is a very
nu|merous tribe. The&s;e frequent our &s;hores, and, like the penguin, have
their legs placed be|hind. They have &s;hort wings, which are not totally
incapable of flight; with round bills for &s;eizing their prey, which is
fi&s;h. They live upon the water, in which they are continually &s;een diving;
and &s;eldom venture upon land, except for the purpo&s;es of continuing their
kind.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of this &s;maller tribe is the Great Northern
Diver, which is nearly of the &s;ize of a goo&s;e: it is beautifully variegated
all over with many &s;tripes, and differs from the penguin, in being much
&s;lenderer and more elegantly formed. The Grey Speckled Diver does not exceed
the &s;ize of a Mu&s;covy duck; and, ex|cept in &s;ize, greatly re&s;embles the
former. The Auk, which breeds on the i&s;lands of St. Kilda, and chiefly
differs from the penguin <PB N="99" REF="107"> in &s;ize and colour. It is
&s;maller than a duck; and the whole of the brea&s;t and belly, as far as the
middle of the throat, is white. The Guillemot is about the &s;ame &s;ize; it
differs from the auk, in having a longer, a &s;lenderer, and a &s;traighter
bill. The Scarlet Throated Diver may be di&s;tingui&s;hed by its name; and the
Puffin or Coulterneb, is one of the mo&s;t remarkable birds we know.</P>
<P>Words cannot ea&s;ily de&s;cribe the form of the bill of the
puffin, which differs &s;o greatly from that of any other bird. Tho&s;e who
have &s;een the coulter of a plough, may form &s;ome idea of the beak of this
odd-looking animal. The bill is flat; but, very different from that of the
duck, its edge is upwards. It is of a triangular figure, and ending in a
&s;harp point; the upper chap bent a little downward, where it is joined to the
head: and a certain callous &s;ub&s;tance encompa&s;&s;ing its ba&s;e, as in
parrots. It is of two colours; a&s;h-coloured near the ba&s;e, and red towards
the point. It has three fur|rows or groves impre&s;&s;ed in it; one in the
livid part, two in the red. The eyes are fenced with a protuberant &s;kin, of a
livid-colour; and they are grey or a&s;h-coloured. The&s;e are marks
&s;ufficient to di&s;tingui&s;h this bird by; but its <PB N="100" REF="108">
value to tho&s;e in who&s;e vicinity it breeds, ren|ders it &s;till more an
object of curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>The puffin, like all the re&s;t of this kind, has its legs
thrown &s;o far back, that it can hardly move without tumbling. This makes it
ri&s;e with difficulty, and &s;ubject to many falls before it gets upon the
wing; but as it is a &s;mall bird, not much bigger than a pigeon, when it once
ri&s;es, it can continue its flight with great celerity.</P>
<P>Both this and all the former build no ne&s;t; but lay their
eggs either in the crevices of rocks, or in holes under ground near the
&s;hore. They chiefly chu&s;e the latter &s;ituation; for the puffin, the auk,
the guillemot, and the re&s;t, cannot ea&s;ily ri&s;e to the ne&s;t when in a
lofty &s;ituation. Many are the attempts the&s;e birds are &s;een to make to
fly up to tho&s;e ne&s;ts which are &s;o high above the &s;urface. In
ren|dering them inacce&s;&s;ible to mankind, they often render them almo&s;t
inacce&s;&s;ible to them|&s;elves. They are frequently obliged to make three or
four efforts, before they can come at the place of incubation. For this
rea&s;on, the auk and guillemot, when they have once laid their &s;ingle egg,
which is extremely large for the &s;ize, &s;eldom for&s;ake it until it is
excluded. The male, who is better furni&s;hed for flight, <PB N="101" REF="109"> feeds the female during this interval; and &s;o bare is the place
where &s;he &s;its, that the egg would often roll down from the rock, did not
the body of the bird &s;upport it.</P>
<P>But the puffin &s;eldom chu&s;es the&s;e inacce&s;&s;ible and
trouble&s;ome heights for its &s;ituation. Re|lying on its courage, and the
&s;trength of its bill, with which it bites mo&s;t terribly, it either makes or
finds a hole in the ground, where to lay and bring forth its young. All the
winter the&s;e birds, like the re&s;t, are ab&s;ent; vi&s;iting regions too
remote for di&s;covery. At the latter end of March, or the beginning of April,
come over a troop of their &s;pies or harbingers, that &s;tay two or three
days, as it were to view and &s;earch out for their former &s;ituations, and
&s;ee whether all be well. This done, they once more depart; and, about the
beginning of May, return again with the whole army of their com|panions. But if
the &s;ea&s;on happens to be &s;tormy and tempe&s;tuous, and the &s;ea
troubled, the unfortunate voyagers undergo incredible hard&s;hips; and they are
found, by hundreds, ca&s;t away upon the &s;hores, lean and peri&s;hed with
famine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Willoughby's Ornith. p.
326.</BIBL></NOTE>. It is mo&s;t probable, therefore, that this voyage is
performed more on the water than in the air; and as they cannot fi&s;h 
<PB N="102" REF="110"> in &s;tormy weather, their &s;trength is exhau&s;ted
before they can arrive at their wi&s;hed-for harbour.</P>
<P>The puffin, when it prepares for breeding, which always
happens a few days after its ar|rival, begins to &s;crape up an hole in the
ground not far from the &s;hore, and when it has &s;ome way penetrated the
earth, it then throws it&s;elf upon its back, and with bill and claws thus
burrows inward, till it has dug a hole with &s;everal windings and turnings,
from eight to ten feet deep. It particularly &s;eeks to dig under a &s;tone,
where it expects the greate&s;t &s;ecurity. In this fortified retreat it lays
one egg; which, though the bird be not much bigger than a pigeon, is of the
&s;ize of a hen.</P>
<P>When the young one's excluded, the parent's indu&s;try and
courage is incredible. Few birds or bea&s;ts will venture to attack them in
their retreats. When the great &s;ea-raven, as Ja|cob&s;on informs us, comes to
take away their young, the puffins boldly oppo&s;e him. Their meeting affords a
mo&s;t &s;ingular combat. As &s;oon as the raven approaches, the puffin catches
him under the throat with its beak, and &s;ticks its claws into his brea&s;t,
which makes the raven, with a loud &s;creaming, attempt to get away; but the
little bird &s;till holds fa&s;t to the invader, <PB N="103" REF="111"> nor
lets him go till they both come to the &s;ea, where they drop down together,
and the raven is drowned: yet the raven is but too often &s;uc|ce&s;sful; and
invading the puffin at the bottom of its hole, devours both the parent and its
family.</P>
<P>But were a puni&s;hment to be inflicted for immorality in
irrational animals, the puffin is ju&s;tly a &s;ufferer from inva&s;ion, as it
is often it&s;elf one of the mo&s;t terrible invaders. Near the I&s;le of
Angle&s;ey, in an i&s;let called Prie&s;holm, their flocks may be compared, for
multitude, to &s;warms of bees. In another i&s;let, called the Calf of Man, a
bird of this kind, but of a different &s;pecies, is &s;een in great abun|dance.
In both places, numbers of rabbits are found to breed; but the puffin,
unwilling to be at the trouble of making a hole, when there is one ready made,
di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the rabbits, and it is not unlikely de&s;troys their
young. It is in the&s;e unju&s;tly acquired retreats that the young puffins are
found in great numbers, and become a very valuable acqui&s;ition to the natives
of the place. The old ones (I am now &s;peaking of the Manks puffin) early in
the morning, at break of day, leave their ne&s;ts and young, and even the
i&s;land, nor do they return till night-fall. All this time they are diligently
<PB N="104" REF="112"> employed in fi&s;hing for their young; &s;o that their
retreats on land, which in the morning were loud and clamorous, are now &s;till
and quiet, with not a wing &s;tirring till the approach of du&s;k, when their
&s;creams once more announce their return. Whatever fi&s;h, or other food, they
have procured in the day, by night begins to &s;uffer a kind of half
dige&s;tion, and is reduced to an oily matter, which is ejected from the
&s;to|mach of the old ones into the mouth of the young. By this they are
nouri&s;hed, and be|come fat to an amazing degree. When they are arrived to
their full growth, they who are intru&s;ted by the lord of the i&s;land, draw
them from their holes; and, that they may more readily keep an account of the
number they take, cut off one foot as a token. Their fle&s;h is &s;aid to be
exce&s;&s;ively rank, as they feed upon fi&s;h, e&s;pecially &s;prats and
&s;ea-weed; however, when they are pickled and pre&s;erved with &s;pices, they
are admired by tho&s;e who are fond of high eating. We are told, that formerly
their fle&s;h was allowed by the church on Lenten days. They were, at that
time, al&s;o taken by ferrets, as we do rabbits. At pre&s;ent, they are either
dug out, or drawn out, from their burrows, with an hooked &s;tick. They bite
extremely hard, and keep &s;uch fa&s;t hold of what&s;oever 
<PB N="105" REF="113"> they &s;eize upon, as not to be ea&s;ily di&s;engaged.
Their noi&s;e when taken is very di&s;agreeable, being like the efforts of a
dumb per&s;on at|tempting to &s;peak.</P>
<P>The con&s;tant depredation, which the&s;e birds annually
&s;uffer, does not in the lea&s;t &s;eem to intimidate them, or drive them
away: on the contrary, as the people &s;ay, the ne&s;t mu&s;t be robbed, or the
old ones will breed there no longer. All birds of this kind lay but one egg;
yet if that be taken away, they will lay another, and &s;o on to a third; which
&s;eems to imply that robbing their ne&s;ts does not much intimidate them from
laying again. Tho&s;e, however, who&s;e ne&s;ts have been thus de&s;troyed, are
often too late in bringing up their young; who, if they be not fledged and
prepared for mi|gration when all the re&s;t depart, are left at land to &s;hift
for them&s;elves. In Augu&s;t the whole tribe is &s;een to take leave of their
&s;ummer re|&s;idence; nor are they ob&s;erved any more till the return of the
en&s;uing &s;pring. It is probable that they &s;ail away to more &s;outhern
regions, as our mariners frequently &s;ee myriads of water-fowl upon their
return, and &s;teering u&s;ually to the north. Indeed, the colde&s;t countries
&s;eem to be their mo&s;t favoured retreats; and the number of water-fowl is
much greater in tho&s;e <PB N="106" REF="114"> colder climates, than in the
warmer regions, near the line. The quantity of oil which abounds in their
bodies, &s;erves as a defence again&s;t cold, and pre&s;erves them in vigour
again&s;t its &s;everity; but the &s;ame provi&s;ion of oil is rather
detrimental in warm countries, as it turns rancid, and many of them die of
di&s;|orders which ari&s;e from its putrefaction. In general, however,
water-fowl can be properly &s;aid to be of no climate; the element upon which
they live, being their proper re&s;idence. They nece&s;&s;arily &s;pend a few
months of &s;ummer upon land, to bring up their young: but the re&s;t of their
time is probably con&s;umed in their migrations, or near &s;ome unknown
coa&s;ts, where their provi&s;ion of fi&s;h is found in greate&s;t
abundance.</P>
<P>Before I go to the third general divi&s;ion of water-fowls, it
may not be improper to ob&s;erve, that there is one &s;pecies of round billed
water-fowl, that does not properly lie within any of the former
di&s;tributions. This is the Goo&s;e-ander; a bird with the body and wing
&s;haped like tho&s;e of the penguin kind, but with legs not hid in the belly.
It may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from all others by its bill, which is round, hooked
at the point, and toothed, both upper and under chap, like a &s;aw. Its colours
are <PB N="107" REF="115"> various and beautiful: however, its manners and
appetites entirely re&s;emble tho&s;e of the Diver. It feeds upon fi&s;h, for
which it dives; and is &s;aid to build its ne&s;t upon trees, like the heron
and the cormorant. It &s;eems to form the &s;hade between the penguin and the
goo&s;e kind; having a round bill, like the one; and unembarra&s;&s;ed legs,
like the other. In the &s;hape of the head, neck and body, it re&s;embles them
both.</P>

<PB N="108" REF="116">
<HEAD>CHAP. IX. Of Birds of the Goo&s;e Kind, properly &s;o
called.</HEAD>
<P>THE Swan, the Goo&s;e, and the Duck, are leaders of a
numerous, u&s;eful, and beautiful tribe of birds, that we have reclaimed from a
&s;tate of nature, and have taught to live in dependance about us. To
de&s;cribe any of the&s;e would be as &s;uperfluous as definitions u&s;ually
are when given of things with which we are already well acquainted. There are
few that have not had opportunities of &s;eeing them, and who&s;e ideas would
not anticipate our de&s;crip|tion. But, though nothing be &s;o ea&s;y as to
di&s;tingui&s;h the&s;e in general from each other, yet the large&s;t of the
duck-kind approach the goo&s;e &s;o nearly, that it may be proper to mark the
di&s;tinctions.</P>
<P>The marks of the goo&s;e are, a bigger body, large wings, a
longer neck, a white ring about the rump, a bill thicker at the ba&s;e,
&s;lenderer towards the tip, with &s;horter legs, placed more forward on the
body. They both have a wadling walk; but the duck, from the po&s;ition of its
legs, has it in a greater degree. By the&s;e marks, the&s;e &s;imilar tribes
may be known <PB N="109" REF="117"> a&s;under; and though the duck &s;hould be
found to equal the goo&s;e in &s;ize, which &s;ometimes happens, yet there are
&s;till other &s;ufficient di&s;tinctions.</P>
<P>But they all agree in many particulars; and have a nearer
affinity to each other than the neighbouring kinds in any other depart|ment.
Their having been tamed has produced alterations in each, by which they differ
as much from the wild ones of their re&s;pective kinds as they do among
them&s;elves. There is nearly as much difference between the wild and the tame
duck, as between &s;ome &s;orts of the duck and the goo&s;e; but &s;till, the
cha|racteri&s;tics of the kind are &s;trongly marked and obvious; and this
tribe can never be mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>The bill is the fir&s;t great obvious di&s;tinction of the
goo&s;e-kind from all of the feathered tribe. In other birds it is round and
wedge-like, or crooked at the end. In all the goo&s;e kind it is flat and
broad, made for the purpo&s;es of &s;kim|ming ponds and lakes of the mantling
weeds that &s;tand on the &s;urface. The bills of other birds are made of an
horny &s;ub&s;tance through|out; the&s;e have their inoffen&s;ive bills
&s;heathed with a &s;kin which covers them all over. The bill of every other
bird &s;eems in &s;ome mea&s;ure formed for piercing or tearing; theirs are
only <PB N="110" REF="118"> fitted for &s;hoveling up their food, which is
chiefly of the vegetable kind.</P>
<P>Though the&s;e birds do not reject animal food when offered
them, yet they can contentedly &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon vegetables, and &s;eldom
&s;eek any other. They are ea&s;ily provided for; wherever there is water,
there &s;eems to be plenty. All the other web-footed tribes are continually
vo|racious, continually preying. The&s;e lead more harmle&s;s lives: the weeds
on the &s;urface of the water, or the in&s;ects at the bottom, the gra&s;s by
the bank, or the fruits and corn in cultivated grounds, are &s;ufficient to
&s;atisfy their ea&s;y ap|petites: yet the&s;e, like every other animal, will
not reject fle&s;h, if properly prepared for them; it is &s;ufficient prai&s;e
to them that they do not eagerly pur&s;ue it.</P>
<P>As their food is chiefly vegetables, &s;o their fecundity is
in proportion. We have had fre|quent opportunities to ob&s;erve, that all the
pre|datory tribes, whether of birds or quadrupedes, are barren and unfruitful.
We have &s;een the lion with its two cubs; the eagle with the &s;ame number;
and the penguin with even but one. Nature that has &s;upplied them with powers
of de&s;truction, has denied them fertility. But it is otherwi&s;e with the&s;e
harmle&s;s animals I am de&s;cribing. They &s;eem formed to fill up the
cha&s;ms in animated nature, cau&s;ed by the vo|raciou&s;ne&s;s 
<PB N="111" REF="119"> of others. They breed in great abundance, and lead their
young to the pool the in&s;tant they are excluded.</P>
<P>As their food is &s;imple, &s;o their fle&s;h is nouri&s;hing
and whole&s;ome. The &s;wan was con&s;idered as a high delicacy among the
an|cients; the goo&s;e was ab&s;tained from as totally indige&s;tible. Modern
manners have inverted ta&s;tes; the goo&s;e is now become the favourite; and
the &s;wan is &s;eldom brought to table unle&s;s for the purpo&s;es of
o&s;tentation. But at all times the fle&s;h of the duck was in high e&s;teem;
the ancients thought even more highly of it than we do. We are contented to eat
it as a delicacy; they al&s;o con&s;idered it as a medicine; and Plu|tarch
a&s;&s;ures us, that Cato kept his whole fa|mily in health, by feeding them
with duck whenever they threatened to be out of order.</P>
<P>The&s;e qualities of great fecundity, ea&s;y &s;u&s;|tenance,
and whole&s;ome nouri&s;hment, have been found &s;o con&s;iderable as to induce
man to take the&s;e birds from a &s;tate of nature and render them dome&s;tic.
How long they have been thus dependants upon his plea&s;ures is not known; for
from the earlie&s;t accounts, they were con&s;idered as familiars about him.
The time mu&s;t have been very remote; for there have been many changes wrought
in <PB N="112" REF="120"> their colours, their figures, and even their internal
parts, by human cultivation. The different kinds of the&s;e birds, in a wild
&s;tate, are &s;imple in their colourings: when one has &s;een a wild goo&s;e
or a wild duck, a de&s;cription of its plumage will, to a feather, exactly
corre|&s;pond with that of any other. But in the tame kinds no two of any
&s;pecies are exactly alike. Different in their &s;ize, their colours, and
fre|quently in their general form. They &s;eem the mere creatures of art; and,
having been &s;o long dependant upon man for &s;upport, they &s;eem to
a&s;&s;ume forms entirely &s;uited to his plea&s;ures or nece&s;&s;ities.</P>

<PB N="113" REF="121">
<HEAD>CHAP. X. Of the Swan, tame and wild.</HEAD>
<P>NO bird makes a more indifferent figure upon land, or a more
beautiful one in the water, than the Swan. When it a&s;cends from its
fa|vourite element, its motions are aukward, and its neck is &s;tretched
forward with an air of &s;tupidity; but when it is &s;een &s;moothly &s;ail|ing
along the water, commanding a thou&s;and graceful attitudes, moving at
plea&s;ure without the &s;malle&s;t effort, when it 
<Q REND="inline">"proudly rows its &s;tate," as Milton has it,
"with arched neck, between its white wings mantling,"</Q> there is not a more
beautiful figure in all nature. In the exhibition of its form, there are no
broken or har&s;h lines; no con&s;trained or catching mo|tions; but the
rounde&s;t contours, and the ea&s;ie&s;t tran&s;itions; the eye wanders over
every part with in&s;atiable plea&s;ure, and every part takes a new grace with
new motion.</P>
<P>This fine bird has long been rendered do|me&s;tic; and it is
now a doubt whether there be any of the tame kind in a &s;tate of nature. The
wild &s;wan, though &s;o &s;trongly re&s;embling this in colour and form, is
yet a different bird; for it <PB N="114" REF="122"> is very differently formed
within. The wild &s;wan is le&s;s than the tame by almo&s;t a fourth; for as
the one weighs twenty pounds, the other only weighs &s;ixteen pounds and three
quarters. The colour of the tame &s;wan is all over white; that of the wild
bird is, along the back and the tips of the wings, of an a&s;h-colour. But
the&s;e are &s;light differences, compared to what are found upon
di&s;&s;ection. In the tame &s;wan, the wind-pipe &s;inks down into the lungs
in the ordinary manner; but in the wild, after a &s;trange and wonderful
contortion, like what we have &s;een in the crane, it enters through a hole
formed in the brea&s;t-bone; and being reflected therein, returns by the &s;ame
aperture; and being contracted into a narrow compa&s;s by a broad and bony
cartilage, it is divided into two branches, which, before they enter the lungs,
are dilated and as it were &s;wolen out into two cavities.</P>
<P>Such is the extraordinary difference between the&s;e two
animals, which externally &s;eem to be of one &s;pecies. Whether it is in the
power of long continued captivity and dome&s;tication to produce this &s;trange
variety, between birds otherwi&s;e the &s;ame, I will not take upon me to
determine. But certain it is, that our tame &s;wan is no where to be found, at
lea&s;t in Europe, in a &s;tate of nature.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="123">As it is not ea&s;y to account for this
difference of conformation, &s;o it is &s;till more difficult to reconcile the
accounts of the ancients with the experience of the moderns, concerning the
vocal powers of this bird. The tame &s;wan is one of the mo&s;t &s;ilent of all
birds; and the wild one has a note extremely loud and di&s;agreeable. It is
probable, the convolutions of the wind-pipe may contribute to encrea&s;e the
clangor of it; for &s;uch is the har&s;hne&s;s of its voice, that the bird from
thence has been called the Hooper. In neither is there the &s;malle&s;t de|gree
of melody; nor have they, for above this century, been &s;aid to give
&s;pecimens of the &s;malle&s;t mu&s;ical abilities: yet, notwith&s;tanding
this, it was the general opinion of antiquity, that the &s;wan was a mo&s;t
melodious bird; and that, even to its death, its voice went on im|proving. It
would &s;hew no learning to produce what they have &s;aid upon the mu&s;ic of
the &s;wan: it has already been collected by Aldrovandus; and &s;till more
profe&s;&s;edly by the Abbe Gedoyn, in the Tran&s;actions of the Academy of
Belles Lettres. From the&s;e accounts it appears that, while Plato,
Ari&s;totle, and Diodorus Siculus, believed the vocality of the &s;wan, Pliny
and Virgil &s;eem to doubt that received opinion. In this equipoi&s;e of
authority, Aldrovandus &s;eems to have deter|mined <PB N="116" REF="124"> in
favour of the Greek philo&s;ophers; and the form of the wind-pipe in the wild
&s;wan, &s;o much re&s;embling a mu&s;ical in&s;trument, in|clined his belief
&s;till more &s;trongly. In aid of this al&s;o, came the te&s;timony of
Penda&s;ius, who affirmed, that he had often heard &s;wans &s;weetly &s;inging
in the lake of Mantua, as he was rowed up and down in a boat; as al&s;o of
Olaus Wormius, who profe&s;&s;ed that many of his friends and &s;cholars had
heard them &s;inging. 
<Q REND="inline">"There was," &s;ays he, "in my family, a very
hone&s;t young man, John Ro&s;torph, a &s;tu|dent in divinity, and a Norwegian
by nation. This man did, upon his credit, and with the interpo&s;ition of an
oath, &s;olemnly affirm that once, in the territory of Dronten, as he was
&s;tanding on the &s;ea &s;hore, early in the morn|ing, he heard an unu&s;ual
and &s;weet murmur, compo&s;ed of mo&s;t plea&s;ant whi&s;tlings and &s;ounds;
he knew not at fir&s;t whence they came, or how they were made, for he &s;aw no
man near to produce them; but looking round about him, and climbing to the top
of a certain pro|montory, he there e&s;pied an infinite number of &s;wans
gathered together in a bay, and making the mo&s;t delightful harmony: a
&s;weeter in all his life-time he had never heard."</Q> The&s;e were accounts
&s;ufficient at lea&s;t to keep opinion in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, though in
con|tradiction <PB N="117" REF="125"> to our own experience; but Aldro|vandus,
to put, as he &s;uppo&s;ed, the que&s;tion pa&s;t all doubt, gives us the
te&s;timony of a country|man of our own, from whom he had the relation. This
hone&s;t man's name was Mr. George Braun, who a&s;&s;ured him, that nothing was
more common in England, than to hear &s;wans &s;ing; that they were bred in
great numbers in the &s;ea, near London; and that every fleet of &s;hips that
returned from their voyages from di&s;tant countries, were met by &s;wans, that
came joyfully out to welcome their return, and &s;alute them with a loud and
chearful &s;inging! It was in this manner that Aldrovandus, that great and good
man, was frequently impo&s;ed upon by the de&s;igning and the needy: his
unbounded cu|rio&s;ity drew round him people of every kind, and his
genero&s;ity was as ready to reward fal&s;e|hood as truth&mdash;Poor
Aldrovandus! after having &s;pent a va&s;t fortune, for the purpo&s;es of
enlight|ening mankind; after having collected more truth and more
fal&s;e&s;hood than any man ever did before him, he little thought of being
re|duced at la&s;t to want bread, to feel the ingra|titude of his country, and
to die a beggar in a public ho&s;pital!</P>
<P>Thus it appears that our modern authorities, in favour of the
&s;inging of &s;wans, are rather <PB N="118" REF="126"> &s;u&s;picious, &s;ince
they are reduced to this Mr. George Braun, and John Ro&s;torph, the native of a
country remarkable for ignorance and cre|dulity. It is probable the ancients
had &s;ome mythological meaning in a&s;cribing melody to the &s;wan; and as for
the moderns, they &s;carce de&s;erve our regard. The &s;wan, therefore, mu&s;t
be content with that &s;hare of fame which it po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es on the &s;core
of its beauty; &s;ince the me|lody of its voice, without better te&s;timony,
will &s;carcely be admitted by even the credulous.</P>
<P>This beautiful bird is as delicate in its ap|petites, as
elegant in its form. Its chief food is corn, bread, herbs growing in the water,
and roots and &s;eeds, which are found near the margin. It prepares a ne&s;t in
&s;ome retired part of the bank, and chiefly where there is an i&s;let in the
&s;tream. This is compo&s;ed of water-plants, long gra&s;s and &s;ticks; and
the male and fe|male a&s;&s;i&s;t in forming it with great a&s;&s;iduity. The
&s;wan lays &s;even or eight eggs, white, much larger than tho&s;e of a
goo&s;e, with a hard, and &s;ometimes a tuberous &s;hell. It &s;its near two
months before its young are excluded; which are a&s;h-coloured when they
fir&s;t leave the &s;hell, and for &s;ome months after. It is not a little
dangerous to approach the old ones, when their little family are feeding round
them. Their <PB N="119" REF="127"> fears, as well as their pride, &s;eems to
take the alarm; and they have &s;ometimes been known to give a blow with their
pinion, that has broke a man's leg or arm.</P>
<P>It is not till they are a twelve-month old that the young
&s;wans change their colour with their plumage. All the &s;tages of this bird's
approach to maturity are &s;low, and &s;eem to mark its longevity. It is two
months hatching; a year in growing to its proper &s;ize; and if, according to
Pliny's ob&s;ervation, that tho&s;e animals that are longe&s;t in the womb are
the longe&s;t lived, the &s;wan is the longe&s;t in the &s;hell of any bird we
know, and is &s;aid to be re|markable for its longevity. Some &s;ay that it
lives three hundred years; and Willoughby, who is in general diffident enough,
&s;eems to believe the report. A goo&s;e, as he ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, has been
known to live an hundred; and the &s;wan, from its &s;uperior &s;ize, and from
its harder, firmer fle&s;h, may naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed to live &s;till
longer.</P>
<P>Swans were formerly held in &s;uch great e&s;teem in England,
that, by an act of Edward the Fourth, none, except the &s;on of the king, was
permitted to keep a &s;wan, unle&s;s po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of five marks a year. By
a &s;ub&s;equent act, the puni&s;hment for taking their eggs was
impri&s;on|ment <PB N="120" REF="128"> for a year and a day, and a fine at the
king's will. At pre&s;ent they are but little valued for the delicacy of their
fle&s;h; but many are &s;till pre&s;erved for their beauty. We &s;ee multitudes
on the Thames and Trent; but no where greater numbers than on the &s;alt-water
inlet of the &s;ea near Abbot&s;berry, in Dor&s;et|&s;hire.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. Of the Goo&s;e and its Varieties.</HEAD>
<P>THE Goo&s;e, in its dome&s;tic &s;tate, exhibits a variety of
colours. The wild goo&s;e always re|tains the &s;ame marks: the whole upper
part is a&s;h-coloured; the brea&s;t and belly are of a dirty white; the bill
is narrow at the ba&s;e, and at the tip it is black; the legs are of a
&s;affron colour, and the claws black. The&s;e marks are &s;eldom found in the
tame; who&s;e bill is entirely red, and who&s;e legs are entirely brown. The
wild goo&s;e is rather le&s;s than the tame; but both in|variably retain a
white ring round their tail, which &s;hews that they are both de&s;cended from
the &s;ame original.</P>
<P>The wild goo&s;e is &s;uppo&s;ed to breed in the northern
parts of Europe; and, in the begin|ning of winter, to de&s;cend into more
tem|perate regions. They are often &s;een flying at very great heights, in
flocks from fifty to an hundred, and &s;eldom re&s;ting by day. Their cry is
frequently heard when they are at an im|perceptible di&s;tance above us; and
this &s;eems bandied from one to the other, as among hounds in the pur&s;uit.
Whether this be the <PB N="122" REF="130"> note of mutual encouragement, or the
nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of re&s;piration, is doubtful; but they &s;eldom
exert it when they alight in the&s;e journies.</P>
<P>Upon their coming to the ground by day, they range
them&s;elves in a line, like cranes; and &s;eem rather to have de&s;cended for
re&s;t, than for other refre&s;hment. When they have &s;at in this manner for
an hour or two, I have heard one of them, with a loud long note, &s;ound a kind
of charge, to which the re&s;t punctually attended, and they pur&s;ued their
journey with renewed alacrity. Their flight is very regularly arranged: they
either go in a line a-brea&s;t, or in two lines, joining in an angle in the
middle. I doubt whether the form of their flight be thus arranged to cut the
air with greater ea&s;e, as is commonly believed; I am more apt to think it is
to pre&s;ent a &s;maller mark to fowlers from below. A bullet might ea&s;ily
reach them, if huddled together in a flock, and the &s;ame di&s;charge might
de&s;troy &s;everal at once; but, by their manner of flying, no &s;hot from
below can affect above one of them; and from the height at which they fly, this
is not ea&s;y to be hit.</P>
<P>The Barnacle differs in &s;ome re&s;pects from both the&s;e;
being le&s;s than either, with a <PB N="123" REF="131"> black bill, much
&s;horter than either of the preceding. It is &s;carce nece&s;&s;ary to com|bat
the idle error of this bird's being bred from a &s;hell &s;ticking to &s;hip's
bottoms; it is well known to be hatched from an egg, in the ordinary manner,
and to differ in very few par|ticulars from all the re&s;t of its kind.</P>
<P>The Brent Goo&s;e is &s;till le&s;s than the former, and not
bigger than a Mu&s;covy duck, except that the body is longer. The head, neck,
and upper part of the brea&s;t, are black; but about the middle of the neck, on
each &s;ide, are two &s;mall &s;pots or lines of white, which together appear
like a ring.</P>
<P>The&s;e, and many other varieties, are found in this kind;
which agree in one common cha|racter of feeding upon vegetables, and being
remarkable for their fecundity. Of the&s;e, how|ever, the tame goo&s;e is the
mo&s;t fruitful. Hav|ing le&s;s to fear from its enemies, leading a &s;ecurer
and a more plentiful life, its prolific powers encrea&s;e in proportion to its
ea&s;e; and though the wild goo&s;e &s;eldom lays above eight eggs, the tame
goo&s;e is often &s;een to lay above twenty. The female hatches her eggs with
great a&s;&s;iduity; while the Gander vi&s;its her twice or thrice a day, and
&s;ometimes drives her off to take her place, where he &s;its with great
&s;tate and compo&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="132">But beyond that of all animals is his
pride when the young are excluded: he &s;eems then to con&s;ider him&s;elf as a
champion not only obliged to defend his young, but al&s;o to keep off the
&s;u&s;picion of danger; he pur&s;ues dogs and men that never attempt to
mole&s;t him; and, though the mo&s;t harmle&s;s thing alive, is then the mo&s;t
petulant and provoking. When, in this manner, he has pur&s;ued the calf or the
ma&s;tiff, to who&s;e contempt alone he is indebted for &s;afety, he returns to
his female and her brood in triumph, clapping his wings, &s;creaming, and
&s;hewing all the marks of con&s;cious &s;upe|riority. It is probable, however,
the&s;e arts &s;uc|ceed in rai&s;ing his importance among the tribe where they
are di&s;played; and it is probable there is not a more re&s;pectable animal on
earth to a goo&s;e than a gander!</P>
<P>A young goo&s;e is generally reckoned very good eating; yet
the feathers of this bird &s;till farther encrea&s;e its value. I feel my
obligations to this animal every word I write; for, however deficient a man's
head may be, his pen is nim|ble enough upon every occa&s;ion: it is happy
indeed for us, that it requires no great effort to put it in motion. But the
feathers of this bird are &s;till as valuable in another capacity, as they make
the &s;ofte&s;t and the warme&s;t beds to &s;leep on.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="133">Of goo&s;e-feathers mo&s;t of our beds
in Europe are compo&s;ed; in the countries bordering on the Levant, and in all
A&s;ia, the u&s;e of them is utterly unknown. They there u&s;e matra&s;&s;es,
&s;tuffed with wool, or camel's hair or cotton; and the warmth of their climate
may perhaps make them di&s;pen&s;e with cu&s;hions of a &s;ofter kind. But how
it happens that the ancients had not the u&s;e of feather-beds, is to me
&s;ur|prizing: Pliny tell us, indeed, that they made bol&s;ters of feathers to
lay their heads on; and this &s;erves as a proof that they turned feathers to
no other u&s;es.</P>
<P>As feathers are a very valuable commodity, great numbers of
gee&s;e are kept tame in the fens in Lincoln&s;hire, which are plucked once or
twice a year. The&s;e make a con&s;iderable article of commerce. The feathers
of Somer|&s;et&s;hire are mo&s;t in e&s;teem; tho&s;e of Ireland are reckoned
the wor&s;t. Hud&s;on's Bay al&s;o furni&s;hes very fine feathers, &s;uppo&s;ed
to be of the goo&s;e kind. The down of the &s;wan is brought from Dantzic. The
&s;ame place al&s;o &s;ends us great quantities of the feathers of the cock and
hen; but Greenland, Iceland, and Norway, furni&s;h the be&s;t feathers of all:
and in this number we may reckon the Eider down, of which we &s;hall take
notice in its place. The <PB N="126" REF="134"> be&s;t method of curing
feathers, is to lay them in a room in an open expo&s;ure to the &s;un, and,
when dried, to put them into bags, and beat them well with poles to get the
du&s;t off. But, after all, nothing will prevent, for a time, the heavy &s;mell
which ari&s;es from the putrefaction of the oil contained in every feather; no
expo&s;ure will draw this off, how long &s;oever it be con|tinued; they mu&s;t
be lain upon, which is the only remedy: and, for this rea&s;on, old feathers
are much more valuable than new.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. Of the Duck and its Varieties.</HEAD>
<P>THE Tame Duck is the mo&s;t ea&s;ily reared of all our
dome&s;tic animals. The very in&s;tincts of the young ones direct them to their
favourite element; and though they are conducted by a hen, yet they de&s;pi&s;e
the admonitions of their leader.</P>
<P>This &s;erves as an inconte&s;tible proof that all birds have
their manners rather from nature than education. A falcon pur&s;ues the
partridge, not becau&s;e it is taught by the old one, but becau&s;e its
appetites make their importunate call for animal food; the cuckoo follows a
very different trade from that which its nur&s;e en|deavoured to teach it; and,
if we may credit Pliny, in time de&s;troys its in&s;tructor: animals of the
duck kind al&s;o follow their appetites, not their tutor, and come to all their
various perfections without any guide. All the arts po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by man,
are the re&s;ult of accumulated experience; all the arts of inferior animals
are &s;elf-taught, and &s;carce one acquired by imitation.</P>
<P>It is u&s;ual with the good women to lay duck-eggs under a
hen, becau&s;e &s;he hatches them <PB N="128" REF="136"> better than the
original parent would have done. The duck &s;eems to be an heedle&s;s,
inattentive mother; &s;he frequently leaves her eggs till they &s;poil, and
even &s;eems to forget that &s;he is entru&s;ted with the charge: &s;he is
equally regardle&s;s of them when excluded; &s;he leads them to the pond, and
thinks &s;he has &s;ufficiently provided for her offspring when &s;he has
&s;hewn them the water. Whatever advantages may be procured by coming near the
hou&s;e, or attending in the yard, &s;he declines them all; and often lets the
vermin, who haunt the waters, de&s;troy them, rather than bring them to take
&s;helter nearer home. The hen is a nur&s;e of a very oppo&s;ite character;
&s;he broods with the utmo&s;t a&s;&s;iduity, and generally brings forth a
young one from every egg com|mitted to her charge; &s;he does not lead her
younglings to the water indeed, but &s;he watch|fully guards them when there by
&s;tanding at the brink. Should the rat, or the weazle, at|tempt to &s;eize
them, the hen can give them protection; &s;he leads them to the hou&s;e when
tired with padling, and rears up the &s;uppo&s;i|tious brood, without ever
&s;u&s;pecting that they belong to another.</P>
<P>The wild duck differs, in many re&s;pects, from the tame; and
in them there is &s;till greater <PB N="129" REF="137"> variety than among the
dome&s;tic kinds. Of the tame duck there are not le&s;s than ten different
&s;orts; and of the wild, Bri&s;&s;on reckons above twenty. The mo&s;t obvious
di&s;tinction between wild and tame ducks is in the colour of their feet;
tho&s;e of the tame duck being black; tho&s;e of the wild duck yellow. The
difference be|tween wild ducks among each other, ari&s;es as well from their
&s;ize as the nature of the place they feed in. Sea-ducks, which feed in the
&s;alt|water, and dive much, have a broad bill, bend|ing upwards, a large hind
toe, and a long blunt tail. Pond-ducks, which feed in pla&s;hes, have a
&s;traight and narrow bill, a &s;mall hind toe, and a &s;harp pointed train.
The former are called, by our decoy-men, foreign ducks; the latter are
&s;uppo&s;ed to be natives of England. It would be tedious to enter into the
minute varieties of &s;uch a number of birds; all agreeing in the &s;ame
general figure, the &s;ame habits and mode of living, and differing in little
more than their &s;ize and the colours of their plumage. In this tribe, we may
rank, as natives of our own European dominions, the Eider Duck, which is double
the &s;ize of a common duck, with a black bill; the Velvet Duck, not &s;o
large, and with a yellow bill; the Scoter, with a knob at the ba&s;e of a
yellow bill; the Tufted Duck, <PB N="130" REF="138"> adorned with a thick
cre&s;t; the Scaup Duck, le&s;s than the common duck, with the bill of a
greyi&s;h blue colour; the Golden Eye, with a large white &s;pot at the corners
of the mouth, re&s;embling an eye; the Sheldrake, with the bill of a bright
red, and &s;welling into a knob; the Mallard, which is the &s;tock from whence
our tame breed has probably been produced; the Pintail, with the two middle
feathers of the tail three inches longer than the re&s;t; the Pochard, with the
head and neck of a bright bay; the Widgeon, with a lead-coloured bill, and the
plumage of the back marked with narrow black and white undulated lines, but
be&s;t known by its whi&s;tling &s;ound: la&s;tly, the Teal, which is the
&s;malle&s;t of this kind, with the bill black, the head and upper part of the
neck of a bright bay. The&s;e are the mo&s;t common birds of the duck kind
among our&s;elves; but who can de|&s;cribe the amazing variety of this tribe,
if he extends his view to the different quarters of the world? The mo&s;t noted
of the foreign tribe are, the Mu&s;covy duck, or, more properly &s;peaking, the
Mu&s;k Duck, &s;o called from a &s;uppo&s;ed mu&s;ky &s;mell, with naked &s;kin
round the eyes, and which is a native of Africa. The Bra&s;ilian Duck, that is
of the &s;ize of a goo&s;e, all over black except the tips of the wings. The
American Wood Duck, with a variety of <PB N="131" REF="139"> beautiful colours,
and a plume of feathers that falls from the back of the head like a friar's
cowl. The&s;e, and twenty others, might be added, were encrea&s;ing the number
of names the way to enlarge the &s;phere of our compre|hen&s;ion.</P>
<P>All the&s;e live in the manner of our dome&s;tic ducks,
keeping together in flocks in the winter, and flying in pairs in &s;ummer,
bringing up their young by the water-&s;ide, and leading them to their food as
&s;oon as out of the &s;hell. Their ne&s;ts are u&s;ually built among heath or
ru&s;hes, not far from the water; and they lay twelve, fourteen, or more eggs
before they &s;it: yet this is not always their method; the dangers they
con+tinually encounter from their ground &s;ituation, &s;ometimes obliges them
to change their manner of building; and their aukward ne&s;ts are often &s;een
exalted on the tops of trees. This mu&s;t be a very great labour to perform, as
the duck's bill is but ill-formed for building a ne&s;t, and giving the
materials of which it is compo&s;ed a &s;ufficient &s;tability to &s;tand the
weather. The ne&s;t, whether high or low, is generally com|po&s;ed of
&s;ingular materials. The longe&s;t gra&s;s, mixed with heath, and lined within
with the bird's own feathers, u&s;ually go to the compo|&s;ition: however, in
proportion as the climate <PB N="132" REF="140"> is colder, the ne&s;t is more
artificially made, and more warmly lined. In the Artic regions, nothing can
exceed the great care all of this kind take to protect their eggs from the
in|ten&s;ene&s;s of the weather. While the gull and the penguin kind &s;eem to
di&s;regard the &s;evere&s;t cold, the duck, in tho&s;e regions, forms it&s;elf
a hole to lay in, &s;helters the approach, lines it with a layer of long
gra&s;s and clay, within that another of mo&s;s, and la&s;tly, a warm coat of
fea|thers or down. The eider duck is particularly remarkable for the warmth of
its ne&s;t. This bird, which, as was &s;aid, is above twice as large as the
common duck, and re&s;ides in the colder climates, lays from &s;ix to eight
eggs, making her ne&s;t among the rocks or the plants along the &s;ea-&s;hore.
The external materials of the ne&s;t are &s;uch as are in common with the
re&s;t of the kind; but the in&s;ide lining, on which the eggs are immediately
depo&s;ited, is at once the &s;ofte&s;t, warme&s;t, and the lighte&s;t
&s;ub&s;tance with which we are acquainted. This is no other than the in&s;ide
down which covers the brea&s;t of the bird in the breeding-&s;ea&s;on. This the
fe|male plucks off with her bill, and furni&s;hes the in&s;ide of her ne&s;t
with a tape&s;try more valuable than the mo&s;t &s;kilful arti&s;ts can
produce. The natives watch the place where &s;he begins to 
<PB N="133" REF="141"> build, and, &s;uffering her to lay, take away both the
eggs and the ne&s;t. The duck, how|ever, not di&s;couraged by the fir&s;t
di&s;appoint|ment, builds and lays in the &s;ame place a &s;econd time; and
this they in the &s;ame manner take away: the third time &s;he builds, but the
drake mu&s;t &s;upply the down from his brea&s;t to line the ne&s;t with: and,
if this be robbed, they both for&s;ake the place, and breed there no more. This
down the natives take care to &s;e|parate from the dirt and mo&s;s with which
it is mixed; and, though no people &s;tand in more need of a warm covering than
them&s;elves, yet their nece&s;&s;ities compel them to &s;ell it to the more
indolent and luxurious inhabitants of the &s;outh for brandy and tobacco.</P>
<P>As they po&s;&s;e&s;s the faculties of flying and &s;wimming,
&s;o they are in general birds of pa&s;&s;age, and it is mo&s;t probable
perform their journies acro&s;s the ocean as well on the water as in the air.
Tho&s;e that migrate to this country, on the approach of winter, are &s;eldom
found &s;o well ta&s;ted or &s;o fat as the fowls that continue with us the
year round: their fle&s;h is often lean, and &s;till oftner fi&s;hy; which
flavour it has probably contracted in the journey, as their food in the lakes
of Lapland, from whence they de|&s;cend, is generally of the in&s;ect kind.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="142">As &s;oon as they arrive among us, they
are generally &s;een flying in flocks to make a &s;urvey of tho&s;e lakes where
they intend to take up their re&s;idence for the winter. In the choice of
the&s;e they have two objects in view; to be near their food, and yet remote
from inter|ruption. Their chief aim is to chu&s;e &s;ome lake in the
neighbourhood of a mar&s;h where there is at the &s;ame time a cover of woods
and where in&s;ects are found in greate&s;t abundance. Lakes, therefore, with a
mar&s;h on one &s;ide and a wood on the other, are &s;eldom without va&s;t
quantities of wild fowl; and where a couple are &s;een at any time, that is a
&s;ufficient inducement to bring hundreds of others. The ducks flying in the
air are often lured down from their heights by the loud voice of the mallard
from below. Nature &s;eems to have furni&s;hed this bird with very particular
faculties for calling. The wind pipe, where it begins to enter the lungs, opens
into a kind of bony cavity, where the &s;ound is reflected as in a mu&s;ical
in&s;trument, and is heard a great way off. To this call all the &s;tragglers
re&s;ort; and in a week or a fort|night's time, a lake that before was quite
naked is black with water-fowl, that have left their Lapland retreats to keep
company with our ducks who never &s;tirred from home.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="143">They generally chu&s;e that part of the
lake where they are inacce&s;&s;ible to the approach of the fowler, in which
they all appear huddled together, extremely bu&s;y and very loud. What it is
can employ them all the day is not ea&s;y to gue&s;s. There is no food for them
at the place where they &s;it and cabal thus, as they chu&s;e the middle of the
lake; and as for court&s;hip, the &s;ea&s;on for that is not yet come; &s;o
that it is wonderful what can &s;o bu&s;ily keep them occupied. Not one of them
&s;eems a moment at re&s;t. Now pur&s;uing one another, now &s;creaming, then
all up at once, then down again; the whole &s;eems one &s;trange &s;cene of
bu&s;tle with nothing to do.</P>
<P>They frequently go off in a more private manner by night to
feed in the adjacent meadows and ditches, which they dare not venture to
ap|proach by day. In the&s;e nocturnal adventures they are often taken; for,
though a timorous bird, yet they are ea&s;ily deceived, and every &s;pringe
&s;eems to &s;ucceed in taking them. But the greate&s;t quantities are taken in
decoys; which, though well known near London, are yet untried in the remoter
parts of the country. The manner of making and managing a decoy is as
follows.</P>
<P>A place is to be cho&s;en for this purpo&s;e far remote from
the common highway and all noi&s;e <PB N="136" REF="144"> of people. A decoy is
be&s;t where there is a large pond &s;urrounded by a wood, and beyond that a
mar&s;hy and uncultivated country. When the place is cho&s;en, the pool, if
po&s;&s;ible, is to be planted round with willows, unle&s;s a wood an&s;wers
the purpo&s;e of &s;hading it on every &s;ide. On the &s;outh and north &s;ide
of this pool are two, three, or four ditches or channels, made broad towards
the pool, and growing narrower till they end in a point. The&s;e channels are
to be covered over with nets, &s;upported by hooped &s;ticks bending from one
&s;ide to the other; &s;o that they form a vault or arch growing narrower and
narrower to the point, where it is termi|nated by a tunnel-net, like that in
which fi&s;h are caught in weirs Along the banks of the&s;e channels &s;o
netted over, which are called pipes, many hedges are made of reeds &s;lanting
to the edge of the channel, the acute angles to the &s;ide next the pool. The
whole apparatus al&s;o is to be hidden from the pool by a hedge of reeds along
the margin, behind which the fowler manages his operations. The place being
fitted in this manner, the fowler is to provide him&s;elf with a number of wild
ducks made tame, which are called decoys. The&s;e are always to be fed at the
mouth or entrance of the pipe, and to be accu&s;tomed to come at a
whi&s;tle.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="145">As &s;oon as the evening is &s;et in,
<HI>the decoy ri&s;es,</HI> as they term it, and the wild fowl feed during the
night. If the evening be &s;till, the noi&s;e of their wings, during their
flight, is heard at a very great di&s;tance, and produces no unplea&s;ing
&s;en&s;ation. The fowler, when he finds a fit opportunity, and &s;ees his
decoy co|vered with fowl, walks about the pool, and ob|&s;erves into what pipe
the birds gathered in the pool may be enticed or driven. Then ca&s;ting
hemp-&s;eed, or &s;ome &s;uch &s;eed as will float on the &s;uface of the
water, at the entrance and up along the pipe, he whi&s;tles to his decoy-ducks,
who in&s;tantly obey the &s;ummons, and come to the entrance of the pipe, in
hopes of being fed as u&s;ual. Thither al&s;o they are followed by a whole
flock of wild ones, who little &s;u&s;pect the danger preparing again&s;t them.
Their &s;en&s;e of &s;melling however is very exqui&s;ite; and they would
&s;oon di&s;cover their enemy, but that the fowler always keeps a piece of turf
burning at his no&s;e, again&s;t which he breathes; and this prevents the
effluvia of his per&s;on from reaching their exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;es. The wild
ducks, there|fore, pur&s;uing the decoy-ducks, are led into the broad mouth of
the channel or pipe, nor have the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of the man who keeps
hidden behind one of the hedges. When they <PB N="138" REF="146"> have got up
the pipe however, finding it grow more and more narrow, they begin to
&s;u&s;pect danger, and would return back; but they are now prevented by the
man, who &s;hews him&s;elf at the broad end below. Thither, therefore, they
dare not return; and ri&s;e they may not, as they are kept by the net above
from a&s;cend|ing. The only way left them, therefore, is the narrow funnelled
net at the bottom; into this they fly, and there they are taken.</P>
<P>It often happens, however, that the wild|fowl are in &s;uch a
&s;tate of &s;leepine&s;s or dozing, that they will not follow the decoy ducks.
U&s;e is then generally made of a dog who is taught his le&s;&s;on. He
pa&s;&s;es backward and forward between the reed-hedges, in which there are
little holes, both for the decoy-man to &s;ee and for the little dog to pa&s;s
through. This attracts the eye of the wild fowl; who, prompted by curio&s;ity,
advance towards this little animal, while he all the time keeps playing among
the reeds, nearer and nearer the funnel, till they follow him too far to
recede. Sometimes the dog will not attract their attention till a red
handkerchief, or &s;omething very &s;ingular, be put about him. The decoy-ducks
never enter the funnel-net with the re&s;t, being taught to dive under water as
&s;oon as the re&s;t are driven in.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="147">The general &s;ea&s;on for catching fowl
in de|coys is from the latter end of October till Fe|bruary. The taking them
earlier is prohibited by an act of George the Second, which impo&s;es a penalty
of five &s;hillings for every bird de|&s;troyed at any other &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>The Lincoln&s;hire decoys are commonly let at a certain annual
rent, from five pounds to twenty pounds a year; and &s;ome even amount to
thirty. The&s;e principally contribute to &s;up|ply the markets of London with
wild-fowl. The number of ducks, wigeon, and teal, that are &s;ent thither is
amazing. Above thirty thou|&s;and have been &s;ent up in one &s;ea&s;on from
ten de|coys in the neighbourhood of Wainfleet. This quantity makes them &s;o
cheap on the &s;pot, that it is a&s;&s;erted, the &s;everal decoy-men would be
glad to contract for years to deliver their ducks at the next town for
ten-pence the couple.</P>
<P>To this manner of taking wild-fowl in Eng|land, I will
&s;ubjoin another &s;till more extraor|dinary, frequently practi&s;ed in China.
When|ever the fowler &s;ees a number of ducks &s;ettled in any particular
pla&s;h of water, he &s;ends off two or three gourds to float among them.
The&s;e gourds re&s;emble our pompions; but, being made hollow, they &s;wim on
the &s;urface <PB N="140" REF="148"> of the water; and on one pool there may
&s;ome|times be &s;een twenty or thirty of the&s;e gourds floating together.
The fowl at fir&s;t are a little &s;hy of coming near them; but by degrees they
come nearer; and as all birds at la&s;t grow fa|miliar with a &s;care-crow, the
ducks gather about the&s;e, and amu&s;e them&s;elves by whetting their bills
again&s;t them. When the birds are as fa|miliar with the gourds as the fowler
could wi&s;h, he then prepares to deceive them in good ear|ne&s;t. He hollows
out one of the&s;e gourds large enough to put his head in; and, making holes to
breathe and &s;ee through, he claps it on his head. Thus accoutred, he wades
&s;lowly into the water, keeping his body under, and no|thing but his head in
the gourd above the &s;ur|face; and in that manner moves imperceptibly towards
the fowls, who &s;u&s;pect no danger. At la&s;t, however, he fairly gets in
among them; while they, having been long u&s;ed to &s;ee gourds, take not the
lea&s;t fright while the enemy is in the very mid&s;t of them; and an
in&s;iduous enemy he is; for ever as he approaches a fowl, he &s;eizes it by
the legs, and draws it in a jerk under water. There he fa&s;tens it under his
girdle, and goes to the next, till he has thus loaded him&s;elf with as many as
he can carry away. When he <PB N="141" REF="149"> has got his quantity, without
ever attempting to di&s;turb the re&s;t of the fowls on the pool, he &s;lowly
moves off-again; and in this manner pays the flock three or four vi&s;its in a
day. Of all the various artifices for catching fowl, this &s;eems likely to be
attended with the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s, as it is the mo&s;t practi&s;ed in
China.</P>

<PB N="142" REF="150">
<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. Of the King-Fi&s;her.</HEAD>
<P>I Will conclude this hi&s;tory of birds with one that &s;eems
to unite in it&s;elf &s;omewhat of every cla&s;s preceding. It &s;eems at once
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of appetites for prey like the rapacious kinds, with an
attachment to water like the birds of that element. It exhibits in its form the
beautiful plumage of the peacock, the &s;hadings of the humming-bird, the bill
of the crane, and the &s;hort legs of the &s;wallow. The bird I mean is the
King-Fi&s;her, of which many extraordinary fal&s;ehoods have been propagated;
and yet of which many extraordinary things remain to be &s;aid that are
actually true.</P>
<P>The king-fi&s;her is not much larger than a &s;wallow; its
&s;hape is clum&s;y; the legs di&s;pro|portionably &s;mall, and the bill
di&s;proportionably long; it is two inches from the ba&s;e to the tip; the
upper chap black and the lower yellow; but the colours of this bird attone for
its inele|gant form; the crown of the head and the co|verts of the wings are of
a deep blacki&s;h green, &s;potted with bright azure; the back and tail are of
the mo&s;t re&s;plendent azure; the whole under-&s;ide of the body is
orange-coloured; a <PB N="143" REF="151"> broad mark of the &s;ame pa&s;&s;es
from the bill be|yond the eyes; beyond that is a large white &s;pot: the tail
is &s;hort, and con&s;i&s;ts of twelve feathers of a rich deep blue; the feet
are of a reddi&s;h yellow, and the three joints of the out|mo&s;t toe adhere to
the middle toe, while the inner toe adheres only by one.</P>
<P>From the diminutive &s;ize, the &s;lender &s;hort legs, and
the beautiful colours of this bird, no per&s;on would be led to &s;uppo&s;e it
one of the mo&s;t rapacious little animals that &s;kims the deep. Yet it is for
ever on the wing, and feeds on fi&s;h, which it takes in &s;urprizing
quantities, when we con&s;ider its &s;ize and figure. It chiefly frequents the
banks of rivers, and takes its prey after the manner of the o&s;prey, balancing
it&s;elf at a certain di&s;tance above the water for a con&s;iderable &s;pace,
then darting into the deep, and &s;eizing the fi&s;h with inevitable
cer|tainty. While it remains &s;u&s;pended in the air, in a bright day, the
plumage exhibits a beautiful variety of the mo&s;t dazzling and brilliant
colours. It might have been this ex|traordinary beauty that has given ri&s;e to
fable; for wherever there is any thing uncommon, fancy is always willing to
encrea&s;e the wonder.</P>
<P>Of this bird it has been &s;aid that &s;he built her ne&s;t on
the water, and thus in a few days hatched and produced her young. But, to be 
<PB N="144" REF="152"> uninterrupted in this ta&s;k, &s;he was &s;aid to be
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a charm to allay the fury of the waves; and during this
period the mariner might &s;ail with the greate&s;t &s;ecurity. The an|cient
poets are full of the&s;e fables; their hi&s;to|rians are not exempt from them.
Cicero has written a long poem in prai&s;e of the halcyon, of which there
remains but two lines. Even the emperor Gordian has written a poem on this
&s;ubject, of which we have nothing remaining. The&s;e fables have been adopted
each by one of the earlie&s;t fathers of the church. 
<Q REND="inline">"Behold," &s;ays St. Ambro&s;e, "the little
bird which in the mid&s;t of the winter lays her eggs on the &s;and by the
&s;hore. From that moment the winds are hu&s;hed; the &s;ea becomes &s;mooth;
and the calm continues for fourteen days. This is the time &s;he requires;
&s;even days to hatch, and &s;even days to fo&s;ter her young. Their Creator
has taught the&s;e little animals to make their ne&s;t in the mid&s;t of the
mo&s;t &s;tormy &s;ea&s;on, only to manife&s;t his kindne&s;s by granting them
a la&s;ting calm. The &s;ea|men are not ignorant of this ble&s;&s;ing; they
call this interval of fair weather their <HI>halcyon days</HI>; and they are
particularly careful to &s;eize the opportunity, as then they need fear no
interruption."</Q> This, and an hundred other <PB N="145" REF="153">
in&s;tances might be given of the credulity of mankind with re&s;pect to this
bird; they entered into &s;peculations concerning the manner of her calming the
deep, the formation of her ne&s;t, and her peculiar &s;agacity; at pre&s;ent we
do not &s;peculate becau&s;e we know, with re&s;pect to our king-fi&s;her, that
mo&s;t of the facts are fal&s;e. It may be alledged, indeed, with &s;ome &s;hew
of rea&s;on, that the Halcyon of the ancients was a different bird from our
king-fi&s;her; it may be urged, that many birds, e&s;pecially on the Indian
ocean, build a floating ne&s;t upon the &s;ea; but &s;till, the hi&s;tory of
the ancient halcyon is clogged with endle&s;s fable; and it is but an
indifferent method to vindicate fal&s;ehood by &s;hewing that a part of the
&s;tory is true.</P>
<P>The king-fi&s;her with which we are acquainted at pre&s;ent,
has none of tho&s;e powers of allaying the &s;torm, or building upon the waves;
it is contented to make its ne&s;t on the banks of rivers, in &s;uch
&s;ituations as not to be affected by the ri&s;ing of the &s;tream. When it has
found a place for its purpo&s;e, it hollows out with its bill a hole about a
yard deep; or if it finds the de&s;erted hole of a rat, or one cau&s;ed by the
root of a tree decaying, it takes quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. This hole it
enlarges at the bottom to a good &s;ize; and, lining it with the down of the
willow, <PB N="146" REF="154"> lays its eggs there without any farther
prepa|ration.</P>
<P>Its ne&s;t, or rather hole, is very different from that
de&s;cribed by the ancients, by whom it is &s;aid to be made in the &s;hape of
a long necked gourd of the bones of the &s;ea-needle. The bones, indeed, are
found there in great quan|tities as well as the &s;cales of fi&s;hes; but
the&s;e are the remains of the bird's food, and by no means brought there for
the purpo&s;es of warmth or convenience. The king-fi&s;her, as Bellonius
&s;ays, feeds upon fi&s;h, but is incapable of dige&s;ting the bones and
&s;cales, which he throws up again as eagles and owls are &s;een to do a part
of their prey. The&s;e fill the bird's ne&s;t of cour&s;e; and, although they
&s;eem as if de&s;ignedly placed there, are only a kind of nui&s;ance.</P>
<P>In the&s;e holes, which, from the remains of fi&s;h brought
there, are very foetid, the king-fi&s;her is often found with from five eggs to
nine. There the female continues to hatch even though di&s;turbed; and though
the ne&s;t be robbed, &s;he will again return and lay there. 
<Q REND="inline">"I have had one of tho&s;e females brought
me," &s;ays Reaumur, "which was taken from her ne&s;t about three leagues from
my hou&s;e. After admiring the beauty of her colours, I let her 
<PB N="147" REF="155"> fly again, when the fond creature was in|&s;tantly
&s;een to return back to the ne&s;t where &s;he had ju&s;t before been made a
captive. There joining the male, &s;he again began to lay, though it was for
the third time, and though the &s;ea&s;on was very far advanced. At each time
&s;he had &s;even eggs. The older the ne&s;t is, the greater quantity of
fi&s;h-bones and &s;cales does it contain: the&s;e are di&s;po&s;ed without any
order; and &s;ometimes take up a good deal of room."</Q></P>
<P>The female begins to lay early in the &s;ea&s;on; and excludes
her fir&s;t brood about the beginning of April. The male, who&s;e fidelity
exceeds even that of the turtle, brings her large pro|vi&s;ions of fi&s;h while
&s;he is thus employed; and &s;he, contrary to mo&s;t other birds, is found
plump and fat at that &s;ea&s;on. The male, that u&s;ed to twitter before this,
now enters the ne&s;t as quietly and as privately as po&s;&s;ible. The young
ones are hatched at the expiration of twenty days; but are &s;een to differ as
well in their &s;ize as in their beauty.</P>
<P>As the ancients have had their fables con|cerning this bird,
&s;o have the modern vulgar. It is an opinion generally received among them
that the fle&s;h of the king-fi&s;her will not cor|rupt, and that it will even
bani&s;h all vermin. <PB N="148" REF="156"> This has no better foundation than
that which is &s;aid of its always pointing, when hung up dead, with its
brea&s;t to the north. The only truth which can be affirmed of this bird when
killed is, that its fle&s;h is utterly unfit to be eaten; while its beautiful
plumage pre&s;erves its lu&s;tre longer than that of any other bird we
know.</P>
<P>Having thus given a &s;hort hi&s;tory of birds, I own I cannot
take leave of this mo&s;t beautiful part of the creation without reluctance.
The&s;e &s;plendid inhabitants of air po&s;&s;e&s;s all tho&s;e qua|lities that
can &s;ooth the heart and cheer the fancy. The brighte&s;t colours, the
rounde&s;t forms, the mo&s;t active manners, and the &s;weete&s;t mu&s;ic. In
&s;ending the imagination in pur&s;uit of the&s;e, in following them to the
chirruping grove, the &s;creaming precipice, or the gla&s;&s;y deep, the mind
naturally lo&s;t the &s;en&s;e of its own &s;ituation, and, attentive to their
little &s;ports, almo&s;t forgot the TASK of de&s;cribing them. Innocently to
amu&s;e the imagination in this dream of life is wi&s;dom; and nothing is
u&s;ele&s;s that, by furni&s;hing mental employment, keeps us for a while in
oblivion of tho&s;e &s;tronger appetites that lead to evil. But every rank and
&s;tate of mankind may find &s;omething to imitate in tho&s;e delightful
&s;ong&s;ters, and we <PB N="149" REF="157"> may not only employ the time, but
mend our lives by the contemplation. From their cou|rage in defence of their
young, and their a&s;&s;i|duity in incubation, the coward may learn to be
brave, and the ra&s;h to be patient. The in|violable attachment of &s;ome to
their compa|nions may give le&s;&s;ons of fidelity; and the con|nubial
tenderne&s;s of others, be a monitor to the incontinent. Even tho&s;e that are
tyrants by nature never &s;pread capricious de&s;truction; and, unlike man,
never inflict a pain but when urged by nece&s;&s;ity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of Fi&s;hes in General.</HEAD>
<P>THE ocean is the great receptacle of fi&s;hes. It has been
thought, by &s;ome, that all fi&s;h are naturally of that &s;alt element; and
that they have mounted up into fre&s;h water, by &s;ome accidental migration. A
few &s;till &s;wim up rivers to depo&s;it their &s;pawn; but of the great body
of fi&s;hes, of which the &s;ize is enormous and the &s;hoals are endle&s;s,
tho&s;e all keep to the &s;ea, and would quickly expire in fre&s;h water. In
that exten&s;ive and undi&s;covered abode, mil|lions re&s;ide, who&s;e manners
are a &s;ecret to us, and who&s;e very form is unknown. The curi|o&s;ity of
mankind, indeed, has drawn &s;ome from <PB N="154" REF="160"> their depths, and
his wants many more: with the figure of the&s;e at lea&s;t he is acquainted;
but for their pur&s;uits, migrations, &s;ocieties, anti|pathies, plea&s;ures,
times of ge&s;tation, and manner of bringing forth, the&s;e all are hidden in
the turbulent element that protects them.</P>
<P>The number of fi&s;h to which we have given names, and of the
figure, at lea&s;t, of which we know &s;omething, according to Linnaeus, are
above four hundred. Thus to appearance in|deed the hi&s;tory of fi&s;h is
tolerably copious; but when we come to examine, it will be found that of the
greate&s;t part of the&s;e we know very little. Tho&s;e qualities,
&s;ingularities or advantages, that render animals worth nam|ing, &s;till
remain to be di&s;covered. The hi&s;tory of fi&s;hes, therefore, has little in
it entertaining: for our philo&s;ophers hitherto, in&s;tead of &s;tu|dying
their nature, have been employed in encrea&s;ing their catalogues; and the
reader, in&s;tead of ob&s;ervations or facts, is pre&s;ented with a long li&s;t
of names, that di&s;gu&s;t him with their barren &s;uperfluity. It mu&s;t
di&s;plea&s;e him to &s;ee the language of a &s;cience encrea&s;ing, while the
&s;cience it&s;elf has nothing to repay the encrea&s;ing tax laid upon his
memory.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t fi&s;h offer us the &s;ame external form; &s;harp at
either end, and &s;welling in the middle; <PB N="155" REF="161"> by which they
are enabled to traver&s;e the fluid which they inhabit, with greater celerity
and ea&s;e. That peculiar &s;hape which Nature has granted to mo&s;t fi&s;hes,
we endeavour to imitate in &s;uch ve&s;&s;els as are de&s;igned to &s;ail with
the greate&s;t &s;wiftne&s;s: however, the progre&s;s of a machine moved
forward in the water by hu|man contrivance, is nothing to the rapidity of an
animal de&s;tined by Nature to re&s;ide there. Any of the large fi&s;h overtake
a &s;hip in full &s;ail with great ea&s;e, play round it without effort, and
out&s;trip it at plea&s;ure. Every part of the body &s;eems exerted in this
di&s;patch; the fins, the tail, and the motion of the whole back-bone,
a&s;&s;i&s;t progre&s;&s;ion; and it is to that flexibility of body at which
art cannot arrive, that fi&s;hes owe their great velocity.</P>
<P>The chief in&s;truments in a fi&s;h's motion, are the fins;
which, in &s;ome fi&s;h, are much more numerous than in others. A fi&s;h
completely fitted for &s;ailing, is furni&s;hed with not le&s;s than two pair;
al&s;o three &s;ingle fins, two above and one below. Thus equipped, it migrates
with the utmo&s;t rapidity, and takes voyages of a thou&s;and leagues in a
&s;ea&s;on. But it does not always happen that &s;uch fi&s;h as have the
greate&s;t number of fins have the &s;wifte&s;t motion: the &s;hark is thought
to be one of the &s;wifte&s;t &s;wim|mers, <PB N="156" REF="162"> yet it wants
the ventral or belly fins; the haddock does not move &s;o &s;wift, yet it is
com|pletely fitted for motion.</P>
<P>But the fins &s;erve not only to a&s;&s;i&s;t the ani|mal in
progre&s;&s;ion, but in ri&s;ing or &s;inking, in turning, or even leaping out
of the water. To an&s;wer the&s;e purpo&s;es, the pectoral fins &s;erve, like
oars, to pu&s;h the animal forward; they are placed at &s;ome little di&s;tance
behind the opening of the gills; they are generally large and &s;trong, and
an&s;wer the &s;ame purpo&s;es to the fi&s;h in the water, as wings do to a
bird in the air. With the help of the&s;e, and by their continued motion, the
flying-fi&s;h is &s;ometimes &s;een to ri&s;e out of the water, and to fly
above an hundred yards; till, fatigued with its exertions, it is obliged to
&s;ink down again. The&s;e al&s;o &s;erve to balance the fi&s;h's head, when it
is too large for the body, and keep it from tumbling prone to the bottom, as is
&s;een in large headed fi&s;hes, when the pec|toral fins are cut off. Next
the&s;e are &s;een the ventral fins, placed toward the lower part of the body,
under the belly: the&s;e are always &s;een to lie flat on the water, in
whatever &s;itua|tion the fi&s;h may be; and they &s;erve rather to rai&s;e or
depre&s;s the fi&s;h in its element, than to a&s;&s;i&s;t progre&s;&s;ive
motion. The dor&s;al fin is &s;itu|ated along the ridge of the back; and
&s;erves <PB N="157" REF="163"> to keep it in equilibrio, as al&s;o to
a&s;&s;i&s;t its progre&s;&s;ive motion. In many fi&s;hes this is wanting; but
in all flat fi&s;hes it is very large, as the pectoral fins are proportionably
&s;mall. The anal fin occupies that part of the fi&s;h which lies between the
anus and the tail; and this &s;erves to keep the fi&s;h in its upright or
vertical &s;ituation. La&s;tly, the tail, which in &s;ome fi&s;hes is flat, and
upright in others, &s;eems the grand in&s;trument of motion: the fins are but
all &s;ub|&s;ervient to it, and give direction to its great impetus, by which
the fi&s;h &s;eems to dart for|ward with &s;o much velocity. To explain all
this by experiment; a carp is taken, and put into a large ve&s;&s;el. The
fi&s;h, in a &s;tate of re|po&s;e, &s;preads all its fins, and &s;eems to
re&s;t upon its pectoral and ventral fins near the bottom: if the fi&s;h folds
up, for it has the power of folding, either of its pectoral fins, it in|clines
to the &s;ame &s;ide; folding the right pec|toral fin, the fi&s;h inclines to
the right &s;ide; folding the left fin, it inclines to that &s;ide in turn.
When the fi&s;h de&s;ires to have a retrogade motion, &s;triking with the
pectoral fins, in a contrary direction, effectually produces it. If the fi&s;h
de&s;ires to turn, a blow from the tail &s;ends it about; but if the tail
&s;trikes both ways, then the motion is progre&s;&s;ive. In pur&s;uance 
<PB N="158" REF="164"> of the&s;e ob&s;ervations, if the dor&s;al and ventral
fins be cut off, the fi&s;h reels to the right and left, and endeavours to
&s;upply its lo&s;s by keeping the re&s;t of its fins in con&s;tant
employ|ment. If the right pectoral fin be cut off, the fi&s;h leans to that
&s;ide; if the ventral fin on the &s;ame &s;ide be cut away, then it lo&s;es
its equili|brium entirely. When the tail is cut off, the fi&s;h lo&s;es all
motion, and gives it&s;elf up to where the water impels it.</P>
<P>From hence it appears, that each of the&s;e in&s;truments has
a peculiar u&s;e a&s;&s;igned it; but, at the &s;ame time, that they all
con&s;pire to a&s;&s;i&s;t each other's motions. Some fi&s;h are
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all, who&s;e motions are yet not the &s;wifte&s;t; others
have but a part, and yet dart in the wa|ter with great rapidity. The number,
the &s;ize, and the &s;ituation of the fins, therefore, &s;eem rather
calculated to corre&s;pond with the animal's figure, than &s;olely to an&s;wer
the purpo&s;es of pro|moting its &s;peed. Where the head is large and heavy,
there the pectoral fins are large, and placed forward, to keep it from
over&s;etting. Where the head is &s;mall, or produced out into a long beak, and
therefore not too heavy for the tail, the pectoral fins are &s;mall, and the
ventral fins totally wanting.</P>
<P>As mo&s;t animals that live upon land are fur|ni&s;hed 
<PB N="159" REF="165"> with a covering to keep off the injuries of the weather,
&s;o all that live in the water are covered with a &s;limy, glutinous matter,
that, like a &s;heath, defends their bodies from the immediate contact of the
&s;urrounding fluid. This &s;ub&s;tance may be con&s;idered as a &s;ecretion
from the pores of the animal's body; and &s;erving, not only to defend, but to
a&s;&s;i&s;t the fi&s;h's ea&s;y progre&s;s through the water. Beneath this, in
many kinds, is found a &s;trong covering of &s;cales, that, like a coat of
mail, defend it &s;till more powerfully; and under that, before we come to the
mu&s;cular parts of the body, an oily &s;ub&s;tance, which &s;upplies the
requi&s;ite warmth and vigour.</P>
<P>The fi&s;h, thus protected and fitted for mo|tion in its
natural element, &s;eems as well fur|ni&s;hed with the means of happine&s;s as
quadru|pedes or birds; but if we come to examine its faculties more nearly, we
&s;hall find it very much their inferior. The &s;en&s;e of touching, which
bea&s;ts and birds have in a &s;mall degree, the fi&s;h, covered up in its own
coat of mail, can have but little acquaintance with.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;e of &s;melling, which in bea&s;ts is &s;o
exqui&s;ite, and among birds is not wholly un|known, &s;eems given to fi&s;hes
in a very mo|derate proportion. It is true, that all fi&s;hes 
<PB N="160" REF="166"> have one or more no&s;trils; and even tho&s;e that have
not the holes perceptible without, yet have the proper formation of the bones
for &s;melling within. But as air is the only medium we know for the
di&s;tribution of odours, it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that the&s;e animals,
re&s;iding in water, can be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any power of being affected by
them. If they have any perception of &s;mells, it mu&s;t be in the &s;ame
manner as we di&s;tingui&s;h by our ta&s;te; and, it is probable, the olfactory
membrane in fi&s;h &s;erves them in|&s;tead of a di&s;tingui&s;hing palate: by
this they judge of &s;ub&s;tances, that, fir&s;t tincturing the water with
their vapours, are thus &s;ent to the no&s;trils of the fi&s;h, and no doubt
produce &s;ome kind of &s;en&s;ation. This mo&s;t probably mu&s;t be the u&s;e
of that organ in tho&s;e animals; as otherwi&s;e there would be the
in&s;truments of a &s;en&s;e provided for them, without any power in them of
enjoyment.</P>
<P>As to ta&s;ting they &s;eem to make very little
di|&s;tinction; the palate of mo&s;t fi&s;h is hard and bony, and
con&s;equently incapable of the powers of reli&s;hing different &s;ub&s;tances.
This &s;en&s;e among quadrupedes, who po&s;&s;e&s;s it in &s;ome de|gree,
ari&s;es from the &s;oft pliancy of the organ, and the delicacy of the &s;kin
which covers the in&s;truments of ta&s;ting; it may be con&s;idered, in 
<PB N="161" REF="167"> them, as a more perfect and delicate kind of feeling: in
the bony palate of fi&s;h, therefore, all powers of di&s;tingui&s;hing are
utterly taken away; and we have accordingly often &s;een the&s;e voracious
animals &s;wallow the fi&s;herman's plum|met in&s;tead of the bait.</P>
<P>Hearing in fi&s;hes is found &s;till more imperfect, if it be
found at all. Certain it is, that anato|mi&s;ts have not been able to
di&s;cover, except in the whale kind, the &s;malle&s;t traces of an organ,
either within or without the head of fi&s;hes. It is true that in the centre of
the brain of &s;ome fi&s;hes are found now and then &s;ome little bones, the
number and &s;ituation of which are entirely accidental. The&s;e bones, Mr.
Klein has &s;uppo&s;ed to con&s;titute the organ of hearing; but if we
con&s;ider their entire di&s;&s;imilitude to the bones that &s;erve for hearing
in other animals, we &s;hall be of another opinion. The greate&s;t number of
fi&s;hes are deprived of the&s;e bones entirely: &s;ome fi&s;h have them in
&s;mall numbers, and others in abundance; yet neither te&s;tify any excellence
or defect in hearing. Indeed, of what advantage would this &s;en&s;e be to
ani|mals that are incapable of making them&s;elves heard? They have no voice to
communicate with each other, and con&s;equently have no need of an organ for
hearing. Mr. Gouan, <PB N="162" REF="168"> who kept &s;ome gold fi&s;hes in a
va&s;e, informs us, that, whatever noi&s;e he made, he could neither di&s;turb
nor terrify them: he hallowed as loud as he could, putting a piece of paper
be|tween his mouth and the water, to prevent the vibrations from affecting the
&s;urface, and the fi&s;hes &s;till &s;eemed in&s;en&s;ible: but when the paper
was removed, and the &s;ound had its full play upon the water, the fi&s;hes
&s;eemed in&s;tantly to feel the change, and &s;hrunk to the bottom. From this
we may learn, that fi&s;hes are as deaf as they are mute; and that when they
&s;eem to hear the call of a whi&s;tle or a bell at the edge of a pond, it is
rather the vibrations of the &s;ound that affect the water, by which they are
excited, than any &s;ounds that they hear.</P>
<P>Seeing &s;eems to be the &s;en&s;e fi&s;hes are
po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of in the greate&s;t degree; and yet even this &s;eems
ob&s;cure, if we compare it to that of other animals. The eye, in almo&s;t all
fi&s;h, is covered with the &s;ame tran&s;parent &s;kin that covers the re&s;t
of the head; and which pro|bably &s;erves to defend it in the water, as they
are without eye-lids. The globe is more de|pre&s;&s;ed anteriorly, and is
furni&s;hed behind with a mu&s;cle, which &s;erves to lengthen or flatten it,
according to the nece&s;&s;ities of the animal. The chry&s;taline humour, which
in quadrupedes is <PB N="163" REF="169"> flat and of the &s;hape of a button
mould, in fi&s;hes is as round as a pea; or &s;ometimes oblong, like an egg.
From all this it appears, that fi&s;h are extremely near-&s;ighted; and that,
even in the water, they can &s;ee objects at a very &s;mall di&s;tance. This
di&s;tance might very ea&s;ily be a&s;certained, by comparing the refraction of
bodies in the water, with that formed by a lens that is &s;pherical. Tho&s;e
un&s;killed in mathe|matical calculations, will have a general idea of this,
from the gla&s;&s;es u&s;ed by near-&s;ighted people. Tho&s;e who&s;e
chry&s;taline humour is too convex, or, in other words, too round, are always
very near-&s;ighted; and obliged to u&s;e concave gla&s;&s;es, to correct the
imperfections of Nature. The chry&s;taline humour of fi&s;h is &s;o round that
it is not in the power of any gla&s;&s;es, much le&s;s of water, to correct
their vi&s;ion. This chry&s;taline humour in fi&s;hes all mu&s;t have &s;een;
being that little hard pea-like &s;ub&s;tance which is found in their eyes
after boiling. In the natural &s;tate it is tran&s;parent, and not much harder
than a jelly.</P>
<P>From all this, it appears how far fi&s;h fall behind
terre&s;trial animals in their &s;en&s;ations, and con&s;equently in their
enjoyments. Even their brain, which is by &s;ome &s;uppo&s;ed to be of a &s;ize
with every animal's under&s;tanding, &s;hews <PB N="164" REF="170"> that fi&s;h
are inferior even to birds in this parti|cular. It is divided into three parts,
&s;urrounded with a whiti&s;h froth, and gives off nerves as well to the
&s;en&s;e of &s;ight as of &s;melling. In &s;ome fi&s;h it is grey, in others
white; in &s;ome it is flatted, in others round; but in all extremely &s;mall,
compared to the bulk of the animal.</P>
<P>Thus Nature &s;eems to have fitted the&s;e ani|mals with
appetites and powers of an inferior kind; and formed them for a &s;ort of
pa&s;&s;ive exi&s;tence in the ob&s;cure and heavy element to which they are
con&s;igned. To pre&s;erve their own exi&s;tence, and to continue it to their
po&s;terity, fill up the whole circle of their pur|&s;uits and enjoyments; to
the&s;e they are im|pelled rather by nece&s;&s;ity than choice, and &s;eem
mechanically excited to every fruition. Their &s;en&s;es are incapable of
making any di&s;tinctions; but they drive forward in pur&s;uit of whatever they
can &s;wallow, conquer, or enjoy.</P>
<P>A cea&s;ele&s;s de&s;ire of food &s;eems to give the ruling
impul&s;e to all their motions. This ap|petite impels them to encounter every
danger; and indeed their rapacity &s;eems in&s;atiable. Even when taken out of
the water, and almo&s;t expire|ing, they greedily &s;wallow the very bait by
which they were allured to de&s;truction.</P>
<P>The maw is, in general, placed next the <PB N="165" REF="171">
mouth; and though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of no &s;en&s;ible heat, is however endued
with a &s;urprizing faculty of dige&s;tion. Its dige&s;tive power &s;eems, in
&s;ome mea&s;ure, to encrea&s;e with the quantity of food it is &s;upplied
with; a &s;ingle pike having been known to devour an hundred roaches in three
days. Its faculties al&s;o are as extraordinary; for it dige&s;ts not only
fi&s;h, but much harder &s;ub&s;tances; prawns, crabs, and lob&s;ters, &s;hells
and all. The&s;e the cod or the &s;turgeon will not only devour, but
di&s;&s;olve down, though their &s;hells are &s;o much harder than the &s;ides
of the &s;tomach which contains them. This amaz|ing faculty in the cold maw of
fi&s;hes has ju&s;tly excited the curio&s;ity of philo&s;ophers; and has
effectually overturned the &s;y&s;tem of tho&s;e, who &s;uppo&s;ed that the
heat of the &s;tomach was alone a &s;ufficient in&s;trument for dige&s;tion.
The truth &s;eems to be, and &s;ome experiments of the &s;kilful Dr. Hunter
&s;eem to evince, that there is a power of animal a&s;&s;imilation lodged in
the &s;tomach of all creatures, which we can neither de&s;cribe nor define,
converting the &s;ub&s;tances they &s;wallow into a fluid fitted for their own
peculiar &s;upport. This is done neither by trituration, nor by warmth, nor by
motion, nor by a di&s;&s;olving fluid, nor by their united efforts; but by
&s;ome principle in the &s;tomach yet unknown, which <PB N="166" REF="172">
acts in a different manner from all kinds of artificial maceration. The meat
taken into the &s;tomach or maw is often &s;een, though very near being
dige&s;ted, &s;till to retain its original form; and ready for a total
di&s;&s;olution, while it ap|pears to the eye as yet untouched by the force of
the &s;tomach. This animal power is lodged in the maw of fi&s;hes, in a greater
degree than in any other creatures; their dige&s;tive powers are quick, and
their appetites ever are craving.</P>
<P>Yet, though fi&s;h are thus hungry, and for+ever prowling, no
animals can &s;uffer the want of food for &s;o long a time. The gold and
&s;ilver fi&s;h we keep in va&s;es &s;eem never to want any nouri&s;hment at
all; whether it be that they feed on the water-in&s;ects, too minute for our
ob&s;ervation, or that water alone is a &s;ufficient &s;upply, is not evident;
but they are often &s;een for months without apparent &s;u&s;tenance. Even the
pike, the mo&s;t voracious of fi&s;hes, will live in a pond where there is none
but him|&s;elf; and, what is more extraordinary, will be often found to thrive
there.</P>
<P>Still, however, fi&s;h are of all other animals the mo&s;t
voracious and in&s;atiable. Whatever any of them is able to &s;wallow
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of life, &s;eems to be con&s;idered as the mo&s;t de&s;irable
food. Some that have very &s;mall mouths feed <PB N="167" REF="173"> upon worms
and the &s;pawn of other fi&s;h: others, who&s;e mouths are larger, &s;eek
larger prey; it matters not of what kind, whether of another or their own.
Tho&s;e with the large&s;t mouths pur&s;ue almo&s;t every thing that has life;
and often meet each other in fierce oppo&s;ition, when the fi&s;h with the
large&s;t &s;wallow comes off with the victory, and devours its
antagoni&s;t.</P>
<P>Thus are they irritated by the continual de&s;ire of
&s;atisfying their hunger; and the life of a fi&s;h, from the &s;malle&s;t to
the greate&s;t, is but one &s;cene of ho&s;tility, violence and eva&s;ion. But
the &s;maller fry &s;tand no chance in the unequal combat; and their u&s;ual
way of e&s;caping, is by &s;wimming into tho&s;e &s;hallows where the greater
are unable or too heavy to pur&s;ue. There they become invaders in turn, and
live upon the &s;pawn of larger fi&s;h, which they find floating upon the
&s;urface of the water: yet there are dangers attending them in every place.
Even in the &s;hallows, the mu&s;cle, the oy&s;ter, and the &s;callop, lie in
ambu&s;h at the bottom, with their &s;hells open, and whatever little fi&s;h
inadvertently approaches into contact, they at once clo&s;e their &s;hells upon
him, and devour the impri&s;oned prey at their lei&s;ure.</P>
<P>Nor is the pur&s;uit of fi&s;hes, like that of ter|re&s;trial
animals, confined to a &s;ingle region, or <PB N="168" REF="174"> to one
effort: &s;hoals of one &s;pecies follow tho&s;e of another through va&s;ts
tracts of ocean, from the vicinity of the pole even down to the equator. Thus
the cod, from the banks of Newfoundland, pur&s;ues the whiting, which flies
before it even to the &s;outhern &s;hores of Spain. The cachalot is &s;aid, in
the &s;ame manner, to pur&s;ue a &s;hoal of herrings, and to &s;wallow
thou|&s;ands at a gulp.</P>
<P>This may be one cau&s;e of the annual mi|gration of fi&s;hes
from one part of the ocean to the other; but there are other motives, which
come in aid of this al&s;o. Fi&s;hes may be induced to change the place of
their re&s;idence, for one more &s;uited to their con&s;titutions, or more
adapted to depo&s;iting their &s;pawn. It is re|markable that no fi&s;h are
fond of very cold waters, and generally frequent tho&s;e places where it is
warme&s;t. Thus, in &s;ummer, they are &s;een in great numbers in the
&s;hallows near the &s;hore, where the &s;un has power to warm the water to the
bottom; on the contrary, in winter, they are found towards the bottom in the
deep &s;ea, for the cold of the atmo&s;phere is not &s;uf|ficiently penetrating
to reach them at tho&s;e great depths. Cold produces the &s;ame effect upon
fre&s;h-water fi&s;hes; and when they are often &s;een dead after &s;evere
fro&s;ts, it is mo&s;t probable that <PB N="169" REF="175"> they have been
killed by the &s;everity of the cold, as well as by their being excluded by the
ice from air.</P>
<P>All fi&s;h live in the water; yet they all &s;tand in need of
air for their &s;upport. Tho&s;e of the whale kind, indeed, breathe the air in
the &s;ame manner as we do, and come to the &s;urface every two or three
minutes to take a fre&s;h in&s;pi|ration: but tho&s;e which continue entirely
under water, are yet under a nece&s;&s;ity of being &s;up|plied with air, or
they will expire in a very few minutes. We &s;ometimes &s;ee all the fi&s;h of
a pond killed, when the ice every where covers the &s;urface of the water, and
thus keeps off the air from the &s;ubjacent fluid. If a hole be made in the
ice, the fi&s;h will be &s;een to come all to that part, in order to take the
benefit of a fre&s;h &s;upply. Should a carp, in a large va&s;e of water, be
placed under an air-pump, and then be deprived of its air, during the operation
a number of bubbles will be &s;een &s;tanding upon the &s;urface of the
fi&s;h's body; &s;oon after the ani|mal will appear to breathe &s;wifter and
with greater difficulty; it will then be &s;een to ri&s;e towards the &s;urface
to get more air; the bubbles on its &s;ur|face begin to di&s;appear; the belly,
that was be|fore &s;wolen, will then fall of a &s;udden, and the animal &s;inks
expiring and convul&s;ed at the bottom.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="176">So very nece&s;&s;ary is air to all
animals, but particularly to fi&s;h, that, as was &s;aid, they can live but a
few minutes without it: yet nothing is more difficult to be accounted for, than
the manner in which they obtain this nece&s;&s;ary &s;up|ply. Tho&s;e who have
&s;een a fi&s;h in the water, mu&s;t remember the motion of its lips and its
gills, or at lea&s;t of the bones on each &s;ide that cover them. This motion
in the animal is, without doubt, analogous to our breathing; but it is not air,
but water, that the fi&s;h actually &s;ucks in and &s;pouts out through the
gills at every motion. The manner of its breathing is thus: the fi&s;h fir&s;t
takes a quantity of water by the mouth, which is driven to the gills; the&s;e
clo&s;e and keep the water &s;o &s;wallowed from returning by the mouth; while
the bony covering of the gills prevents it from going through them, until the
animal has drawn the proper quantity of air from the body of water thus
impri&s;oned: then the bony covers open and give it a free pa&s;&s;age; by
which means al&s;o the gills again are opened and admit a fre&s;h quantity of
water. Should the fi&s;h be prevented from the free play of its gills, or
&s;hould the bony covers be kept from moving, by a &s;tring tied round them,
the animal would &s;oon fall into convul&s;ions and die in a few minutes.</P>
<P>But though this be the general method of <PB N="171" REF="177"> explaining re&s;piration in fi&s;hes, the difficulty remains to know
what is done with this air, which the fi&s;h in this manner &s;eparates from
the water. There &s;eems no receptacle for containing it; the &s;tomach being
the chief cavity within the body, is too much filled with aliment for that
purpo&s;e. There is indeed a cavity, and that a pretty large one, I mean the
air-bladder or &s;wim, which may &s;erve to contain it for vital purpo&s;es;
but that our philo&s;ophers have long de&s;tined to a very different u&s;e. The
u&s;e univer|&s;ally a&s;&s;igned to the air-bladder is the enabling the fi&s;h
to ri&s;e or &s;ink in the water at plea&s;ure, as that is dilated or
compre&s;&s;ed. The u&s;e a&s;&s;igned by the ancients for it was to come in
aid of the lungs, and to remain as a kind of &s;tore-hou&s;e of air to &s;upply
the animal in its nece&s;&s;ities. I own my attachment to this la&s;t opinion;
but let us exhibit both with their proper &s;hare of evidence, and the reader
mu&s;t be left to determine.</P>
<P>The air-bladder is de&s;cribed as a bag filled with air,
&s;ometimes compo&s;ed of one, &s;ome|times of two, and &s;ometimes of three
divi&s;ions, &s;ituated towards the back of the fi&s;h, and open|ing into the
maw or the gullet. Tho&s;e who contend that this bag is de&s;igned for
rai&s;ing or depre&s;&s;ing the fi&s;h in the water, build upon the following
experiment. A carp being put into the <PB N="172" REF="178"> air-pump, and the
air exhau&s;ted, the bladder is &s;aid to expand it&s;elf to &s;uch a degree,
that the fi&s;h &s;wells in an extraordinary manner till the bladder bur&s;ts,
and then the fi&s;h &s;inks, and ever after continues to crawl at the bottom.
On ano|ther occa&s;ion, the air-bladder was pricked and wounded, which let out
its air; upon which the fi&s;h funk to the bottom, and was not &s;een to ri&s;e
after. From thence it is inferred, that the u&s;e of the air-bladder mu&s;t be
by &s;welling at the will of the animal, thus to encrea&s;e the &s;ur|face of
the fi&s;h's body, and thence dimini&s;hing its &s;pecific gravity, to enable
it to ri&s;e to the top of the water, and keep there at plea&s;ure. On the
contrary, when the fi&s;h wants to de&s;cend, it is, &s;ay they, but to
exhau&s;t this bladder of its air; and the fi&s;h being thus rendered &s;limmer
and heavier, con&s;equently &s;inks to the bottom.</P>
<P>Such is the account given of the u&s;e of the air-bladder; no
part of which &s;eems to me well &s;upported. In the fir&s;t place, though
nothing is more certain, than that a carp put into the air-pump will &s;well,
yet &s;o will a mou&s;e or a frog; and the&s;e we know to have no
air-blad|ders. A carp will ri&s;e to the &s;urface: but &s;o will all fi&s;h
that want air, whether they have an air-bladder or not. The air-bladder is
&s;aid to bur&s;t in the experiment; but that I deny. The <PB N="173" REF="179"> air-bladder is indeed found empty, but it has &s;uffered no
laceration, and may be di&s;tended by being blown into like any other bladder
that is &s;ound. The fi&s;h after the experiment, I grant, continues to creep
at the bottom; and &s;o will all fi&s;h that are &s;ick and wounded, which
mu&s;t be the ca&s;e with this after &s;uch an operation. Thus the&s;e facts
prove nothing, but that when the fi&s;h is killed in an air-pump the
air-bladder is found exhau&s;ted; and that it will naturally and
nece&s;&s;arily be; for the drain of air by which the fi&s;h is &s;upplied in
the natural way will nece&s;&s;arily oblige it to make u&s;e of all its hidden
&s;tores; and, as there is a communication between the gullet and the
air-bladder, the air which the latter contains will thus be obviou&s;ly drawn
away. But &s;till farther, how comes the air-bladder, according to their
hypothe&s;is, to &s;well under the experiment of the air-pump? What is it that
clo&s;es the aperture of that organ in &s;uch a manner as at la&s;t to bur&s;t
it; or what ne|ce&s;&s;ity has the fi&s;h for dilating it to that violent
degree? At mo&s;t, it only wants to ri&s;e to the &s;ur|face; and that the
fi&s;h can ea&s;ily do without &s;o great a di&s;tention of the air-bladder.
Indeed, it &s;hould rather &s;eem, that the more the air was wanted without,
the le&s;s nece&s;&s;ity there was for its being u&s;ele&s;sly accumulated
within; and to <PB N="174" REF="180"> make the modern &s;y&s;tem
con&s;i&s;tent, the fi&s;h un|der the air-pump, in&s;tead of permitting its
bladder to be bur&s;t, would readily give up its contents; which, upon their
&s;uppo&s;ition, all can do at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>But the truth is, the fi&s;h can neither encrea&s;e nor
dimini&s;h the quantity of air in its air-bladder at will, no more than we can
that which is con|tained in our &s;tomachs. The animal has no one mu&s;cle,
much le&s;s pair of mu&s;cles, for contracting or dilating this organ; its
aperture is from the gullet; and what air is put into it mu&s;t remain there
till the nece&s;&s;ities, and not the will, of the animal call it forth as a
&s;upply.</P>
<P>But, to put the matter pa&s;t a doubt, many fi&s;h are
furni&s;hed with an air-bladder that continually crawl at the bottom; &s;uch as
the eel and the flounder; and many more are entirely without any bladder, that
&s;wim at ea&s;e in every depth; &s;uch as the anchovy and fre&s;h-water
gudgeon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Redi.</BIBL></NOTE>. Indeed, the number
of fi&s;h that want this organ is alone a &s;ufficient proof that it is not
&s;o nece&s;|&s;ary for the purpo&s;es of &s;wimming; and as the ventral fins,
which in all fi&s;h lie flat upon the water, &s;eem fully &s;ufficient to keep
them at all depths, I &s;ee no great occa&s;ion for this internal
philo&s;ophical apparatus for rai&s;ing and depre&s;s|ing <PB N="175" REF="181"> them. Upon the whole, the air-bladder &s;eems adapted for different
purpo&s;es than that of keeping the fi&s;h at different depths in the water;
but whether it be to &s;upply them with air when it is wanted from without, or
for what other purpo&s;e, I will not take upon me to de|termine.</P>
<P>Hitherto we have &s;een fi&s;h in every re&s;pect inferior to
land animals; in the &s;implicity of their conformation, in their &s;en&s;es,
and their enjoyments; but of that humble exi&s;tence which they have been
granted by nature, they have a longer term than any other cla&s;s of ani|mated
nature. 
<Q REND="inline">"Mo&s;t of the di&s;orders incident to
mankind," &s;ays Bacon, "ari&s;e from the changes and alterations of the
atmo&s;phere; but fi&s;hes re&s;ide in an element little &s;ubject to change;
theirs is an uniform exi&s;tence; their movements are without effort, and their
life without labour. Their bones al&s;o, which are united by cartilages, admit
of indefinite ex|ten&s;ion; and the different &s;izes of animals of the &s;ame
kind among fi&s;hes is very various. They &s;till keep growing; their bodies,
in|&s;tead of &s;uffering the rigidity of age, which is the cau&s;e of natural
decay in land animals, &s;till continue encrea&s;ing with fre&s;h &s;upplies;
and as the body grows the conduits of life furni&s;h their &s;tores in greater
abundance. <PB N="176" REF="182"> How long a fi&s;h that &s;eems to have
&s;carce any bounds put to its growth continues to live is not a&s;certained;
perhaps the life of a man would not be long enough to mea&s;ure that of the
&s;malle&s;t."</Q></P>
<P>There have been two methods devi&s;ed for determining the age
of fi&s;hes, which are more ingenious than certain; the one is by the circles
of the &s;cales, the other by the tran&s;ver&s;e &s;ection of the back-bone.
The fir&s;t method is this. When a fi&s;h's &s;cale is examined through a
mi|cro&s;cope, it will be found to con&s;i&s;t of a number of circles, one
circle within another, in &s;ome mea&s;ure re&s;embling tho&s;e which appear
upon the tran&s;ver&s;e &s;ection of a tree, and &s;uppo&s;ed to offer the
&s;ame information. For as in trees we can tell their age by the number of
their circles, &s;o in fi&s;hes we can tell theirs by the number of circles in
every &s;cale, reckoning one ring for every year of the animal's exi&s;tence.
By this method, Mr. Buffon found a carp, who&s;e &s;cales he examined, to be
not le&s;s than a hundred years old; a thing almo&s;t incredible had we not
&s;everal accounts in other authors which tend to confirm the di&s;covery.
Ge&s;ner brings us an in&s;tance of one of the &s;ame age; and Albertus of one
more than double that period.</P>
<P>The age of the &s;kate and the ray, that want &s;cales, may be
known by the other method; <PB N="177" REF="183"> which is, by &s;eparating the
joints of the back|bone, and then minutely ob&s;erving the number of rings
which the &s;urface where it was joined exhibits. By this the fi&s;h's age is
&s;aid to be known; and perhaps with as much certainty as in the former
in&s;tance.</P>
<P>But how un&s;atisfactory &s;oever the&s;e marks may be, we
have no rea&s;on to doubt the great age of &s;ome fi&s;hes. Tho&s;e that have
ponds often know the olde&s;t by their &s;uperior &s;ize. But the longevity of
the&s;e animals is nothing when compared to their fecundity. All &s;orts, a few
of the larger ones excepted, multiply their kind &s;ome by hundreds and &s;ome
by millions. There are &s;ome that bring forth their young alive, and &s;ome
that only produce eggs: the former are rather the lea&s;t fruitful: yet even
the&s;e are &s;een to produce in great abun|dance. The viviparous blenny, for
in&s;tance, brings forth two or three hundred at a time, all alive and playing
round the parent together. Tho&s;e who exclude their progeny in a more
imperfect &s;tate, and produce eggs, which they are obliged to leave to chance,
either on the bottom at the edge of the water, or floating on the &s;urface
where it is deeper, are all much more prolific; and &s;eem to proportion their
&s;tock to the danger there is of its con&s;umption. Of <PB N="178" REF="184">
the&s;e eggs thus depo&s;ited, &s;carce one in an hundred brings forth an
animal; they are de|voured by all the le&s;&s;er fry that frequent the
&s;hores; by aquatic birds near the margin, and by the larger fi&s;h in deep
water. Still, however, there are enough for &s;upplying the deep with
inhabitants; and, notwith&s;tanding their own ra|pacity and that of the fowls
of various tribes, the numbers that e&s;cape are &s;ufficient to relieve the
wants of a very con&s;iderable part of mankind. Indeed, when we con&s;ider the
numbers that a &s;ingle fi&s;h is capable of producing, the amount will &s;eem
a&s;toni&s;hing. If, for in&s;tance, we &s;hould be told of a being &s;o very
prolific, that in a &s;ingle &s;ea&s;on it could bring forth as many of its
kind as there are inhabitants in England, it would &s;trike us with &s;urprize;
yet a &s;ingle cod produces full that number. The cod &s;pawns in one
&s;ea&s;on, as Lewenhoeck a&s;&s;ures us, above nine million of eggs or peas
contained in one &s;ingle roe. The flounder is commonly known to produce above
one million; and the mackarel above five hundred thou&s;and. Such an amazing
encrea&s;e, if permitted to come to maturity, would over&s;tock nature, and
even the ocean it&s;elf would not be able to contain, much le&s;s to provide
for, the half of its inha|bitants. But two wi&s;e purpo&s;es are an&s;wered by
this amazing encrea&s;e; it pre&s;erves the &s;pecies <PB N="179" REF="185"> in
the mid&s;t of numberle&s;s enemies, and &s;erves to furni&s;h the re&s;t with
a &s;u&s;tenance adapted to their nature.</P>
<P>Fi&s;hes &s;eem, all except the whale-kind, en|tirely
dive&s;ted of tho&s;e parental &s;olicitudes which &s;o &s;trongly mark the
manners of the more perfect terre&s;trial animals. How far they co|pulate
remains as yet a doubt; for though they &s;eem to join, yet the male is not
furni&s;hed with any external in&s;trument of generation. It is &s;aid, by
&s;ome, that his only end in that action is to emit his impregnating milt upon
the eggs that at that time fall from the fe|male. He is &s;aid to be &s;een
pur&s;uing them as they float down the &s;tream, and carefully impregnating
them one after another. On &s;ome occa&s;ions al&s;o the females dig holes in
the bot|tom of rivers and ponds, and there depo&s;it their &s;pawn, which is
impregnated by the male in the &s;ame manner. All this, however, is very
doubtful; what we know with certainty of the matter, and that not di&s;covered
till very lately, is, that the male has two organs of generation that open into
the bladder of urine, and that the&s;e organs do not open into the rectum as in
birds, but have a particular aperture of their own<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Vide Gaman de Generatione Pi&s;cium.</BIBL></NOTE>. The&s;e
organs of generation in the male are <PB N="180" REF="186"> empty at &s;ome
&s;ea&s;ons of the year; but before the time of &s;pawing they are turgid with
what is called the milt, and emit the fluid proper for impregnation.</P>
<P>Fi&s;h have different &s;ea&s;ons for depo&s;iting their
&s;pawn: &s;ome, that live in the depths of the ocean, are &s;aid to chu&s;e
the winter months; but, in general, tho&s;e with which we are acquainted,
chu&s;e the hotte&s;t months in &s;ummer, and prefer &s;uch water as is
&s;omewhat tepefied by the beams of the &s;un. They then leave the deepe&s;t
parts of the ocean, which are the colde&s;t, and &s;hoal round the coa&s;ts, or
&s;wim up the fre&s;h-water rivers, which are warm as they are comparatively
&s;hallow. When they have depo&s;ited their burthens, they then return to their
old &s;tations, and leave their na&s;cent progeny to &s;hift for
them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The &s;pawn continues in its egg-&s;tate in &s;ome fi&s;h
longer than in others, and this in proportion to the animal's &s;ize. In the
&s;almon, for in&s;tance, the young animal continues in the egg from the
beginning of December till the beginning of April; the carp continues in the
egg not above three weeks; the little gold fi&s;h from China is produced
&s;till quicker. The&s;e all, when excluded, at fir&s;t e&s;cape by their
minutene&s;s and agility. They ri&s;e, &s;ink, and turn much readier than grown
<PB N="181" REF="187"> fi&s;h; and they can e&s;cape into very &s;hallow waters
when pur&s;ued. But, with all their ad|vantages, &s;carce one in a thou&s;and
&s;urvives the numerous perils of its youth. The very male and female that have
given them birth, are equally dangerous and formidable with the re&s;t,
forgetting all relation at their departure.</P>
<P>Such is the general picture of the&s;e heedle&s;s and hungry
creatures: but there are &s;ome in this cla&s;s, living in the waters, that are
po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of finer organs and higher &s;en&s;ations; that have all the
tenderne&s;s of birds or quadru|pedes for their young; that nur&s;e them with
con|&s;tant care, and protect them from every injury. Of this cla&s;s are the
<HI>Cetaceous</HI> tribe, or the fi&s;hes of the whale-kind. There are others,
though not capable of nur&s;ing their young, yet that bring them alive into the
world, and defend them with courage and activity. The&s;e are the
<HI>Cartilaginous</HI> kinds, or tho&s;e who have gri&s;tles in&s;tead of
bones. But the fierce unmindful tribe we have been de|&s;cribing, that leave
their &s;pawn without any protection, are called the <HI>Spinous</HI> or bony
kinds, from their bones re&s;embling the &s;harpne&s;s of thorns.</P>
<P>Thus there are three grand divi&s;ions in the fi&s;h-kind: the
<HI>cetaceous,</HI> the <HI>cartilaginous,</HI> and the <HI>&s;pinous</HI>; all
differing from each other in <PB N="182" REF="188"> their conformation, their
appetites, in their bringing forth, and in the education of their young.
The&s;e three great di&s;tinctions are not the capricious differences formed by
a maker of &s;y&s;tems, but are &s;trongly and firmly marked in nature. The&s;e
are the di&s;tinctions of Ari&s;totle; and they have been adopted by mankind
ever &s;ince his time. It will be nece&s;&s;ary, therefore, to give the
hi&s;tory of each of the&s;e in particular; and then to range under each head,
tho&s;e fi&s;hes who&s;e hi&s;tory is the mo&s;t remarkable; or, more properly
&s;peaking, tho&s;e of which we have any hi&s;tory. For we &s;hall find, when
we come to any of the &s;pecies in particular, how little can be &s;aid of
their habits, their &s;tations, or me|thod of propagation.</P>
<P>Much, indeed, can be &s;aid of them, if con&s;idered
relatively to man; and large books have been written of the manner of taking
fi&s;h; or of dre&s;&s;ing them. Apicius is noted for having fir&s;t taught
mankind to &s;uffocate fi&s;h in Cartha|ginian pickle; and Quin for giving a
&s;auce to the Johndory: Mrs. Gla&s;s is famous for her eel pie, and Mr. Tull
for his invention of &s;pay|ing carp to give it a finer flavour. In this manner
our cooks handle the &s;ubject. On the other hand, our phy&s;icians a&s;&s;ure
us that the fle&s;h of fi&s;hes yields little nouri&s;hment, and &s;oon
cor|rupts; <PB N="183" REF="189"> that it abounds in a gro&s;s &s;ort of oil
and water, and hath but few volatile particles, which renders it le&s;s fit to
be converted into the &s;ub&s;tance of our bodies. They are cold and moi&s;t,
and mu&s;t needs, &s;ay they, produce juices of the &s;ame kind, and
con&s;equently are im|proper to &s;trengthen the body. In this di|ver&s;ity of
opinion, it is the wi&s;e&s;t way to eat our fi&s;h in the ordinary manner, and
pay no great attention to cooks or doctors.</P>
<P>I cannot conclude this chapter without put|ting a que&s;tion
to the learned which, I confe&s;s, I am not able to re&s;olve. How comes it
that fi&s;h which are bred in a &s;alt element have yet no &s;alt to the
ta&s;te, or that is capable of being ex|tracted from it?</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of Cetaceous Fi&s;hes in General.</HEAD>
<P>AS on land there are &s;ome orders of animals that &s;eem
formed to command the re&s;t, with greater powers and more various in&s;tincts,
&s;o in the ocean there are fi&s;hes which &s;eem formed upon a nobler plan
than others, and that, to their fi&s;hy form, join the appetites and the
conformation of quadrupedes. The&s;e all are of the <HI>cetaceous</HI> kind;
and &s;o much rai&s;ed above their fellows of the deep, in their appetites and
in&s;tincts, that almo&s;t all our modern naturali&s;ts have fairly excluded
them from the finny tribes, and will have them called, not fi&s;hes, but, great
bea&s;ts of the ocean. With them it would be as improper to &s;ay men go to
Greenland fi&s;hing for whale, as it would be to &s;ay that a &s;port&s;man
goes to Blackwall a fowling for mackarel.</P>
<P>Yet, notwith&s;tanding philo&s;ophers, mankind will always
have their own way of talking; and for my own part I think them here in the
right. A different formation of the lungs, &s;tomach and inte&s;tines, a
different manner of breathing or propagating, are not &s;ufficient to
counterbalance the great obvious analogy which <PB N="185" REF="191"> the&s;e
animals bear to the whole finny tribe. They are &s;haped as other fi&s;hes;
they &s;wim with fins; they are entirely naked, without hair; they live in the
water, though they come up to breathe; they are only &s;een in the depths of
the ocean, and never come upon &s;hore but when forced thither. The&s;e &s;ure
are &s;ufficient to plead in favour of the general denomination, and acquit
mankind of error in ranking them with their lower companions of the deep.</P>
<P>But &s;till they are as many degrees rai&s;ed above other
fi&s;hes in their nature, as they are in general in their &s;ize. This tribe is
compo&s;ed of the Whale and its varieties, of the Cachalot, the Dolphin, the
Grampus, and the Porpe&s;s. All the&s;e re&s;emble quadrupedes in their
internal &s;tructure, and in &s;ome of their appetites and affections. Like
quadrupedes, they have lungs, a midriff, a &s;tomach, inte&s;tines, liver,
&s;pleen, bladder, and parts of generation; their heart al&s;o re&s;embles that
of quadrupedes, with its parti|tions clo&s;ed up as in them, and driving red
and warm blood in circulation through the body. In &s;hort, every internal part
bears a mo&s;t &s;triking &s;imilitude; and to keep the&s;e parts warm, the
whole kind are al&s;o covered between the &s;kin and the mu&s;cles with a thick
coat of fat or blubber, which, like the bacon-fat of an hog, 
<PB N="186" REF="192"> keeps out the cold, renders their mu&s;cles glib and
pliant, and probably makes them lighter in &s;wimming.</P>
<P>As the&s;e animals breathe the air, it is obvious that they
cannot bear to be any long time under water. They are con&s;trained, therefore,
every two or three minutes, to come up to the &s;ur|face to take breath, as
well as to &s;pout out through their no&s;tril, for they have but one, that
water which they &s;ucked in while gaping for their prey. This conduit, by
which they breathe, and al&s;o throw out the water, is placed in the head, a
little before the brain. Though externally the hole is but &s;ingle, it is
internally divided by a bony partition, which is clo&s;ed by a &s;phincter
mu&s;cle on the in&s;ide, that, like the mouth of a pur&s;e, &s;huts it up at
the plea&s;ure of the animal. There is al&s;o another mu&s;cle or valve, which
prevents the water from going down the gullet. When therefore the animal takes
in a certain quantity of water, which is nece&s;&s;ary to be di&s;charged and
&s;eparated from its food, it &s;huts the mouth, clo&s;es the valve of the
&s;tomach, opens the &s;phincter that kept the no&s;tril clo&s;ed, and then
breathing &s;trongly from the lungs, pu&s;hes the water out by the effort, as
we &s;ee it ri&s;e by the pre&s;&s;ure of air in a fire-engine.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="193">The &s;en&s;es of the&s;e animals &s;eem
al&s;o &s;uperior to tho&s;e of other fi&s;hes. The eyes of other fi&s;hes, we
have ob&s;erved, are covered only with that tran&s;parent &s;kin that covers
the re&s;t of the head; but in all the cetaceous kinds, it is co|vered by
eye-lids, as in man. This, no doubt, keeps that organ in a more perfect
&s;tate, by giving it intervals of relaxation, in which all vi&s;ion is
&s;u&s;pended. The other fi&s;hes, that are for ever &s;taring, mu&s;t &s;ee,
if for no other rea&s;on, more feebly, as their organs of &s;ight are always
exerted.</P>
<P>As for hearing, the&s;e al&s;o are furni&s;hed with the
internal in&s;truments of the ear, although the external orifice no where
appears. It is mo&s;t probable that this orifice may open by &s;ome canal,
re&s;embling the Eu&s;tachian tube, into the mouth; but this has not as yet
been di&s;covered.</P>
<P>Yet Nature &s;ure has not thus formed a com|plete apparatus
for hearing, and denied the animal the u&s;e of it when formed. It is mo&s;t
likely that all animals of the cetaceous kind can hear, as they certainly utter
&s;ounds, and bel|low to each other. This vocal power would be as needle&s;s to
animals naturally deaf, as gla&s;&s;es to a man that was blind.</P>
<P>But it is in the circum&s;tances in which they continue their
kind, that the&s;e animals &s;hew an <PB N="188" REF="194"> eminent
&s;uperiority. Other fi&s;h depo&s;it their &s;pawn, and leave the &s;ucce&s;s
to accident: the&s;e never produce above one young, or two at the mo&s;t; and
this the female &s;uckles entirely in the manner of quadrupedes, her brea&s;ts
being placed, as in the human kind, above the navel. We have read many fabulous
accounts of the nur&s;ing of the demigods of antiquity, of their feeding on the
marrow of lions, and their being &s;uckled by wolves; one might imagine a
&s;till more heroic &s;y&s;tem of nutrition, if we &s;up|po&s;ed that the young
hero was &s;uckled and grew &s;trong upon the brea&s;t-milk of a
&s;he-whale.</P>
<P>The whale or the grampus are terrible at any time; but are
fierce and de&s;perate in the defence of their young. In Waller's beautiful
poem of the Summer I&s;lands, we have a &s;tory, founded upon fact, which
&s;hews the maternal tenderne&s;s of the&s;e animals for their offspring. A
whale and her cub had got into an arm of the &s;ea, where, by the de&s;ertion
of the tide, they were enclo&s;ed on every &s;ide. The people from &s;hore
&s;oon &s;aw their &s;ituation, and drove down upon them in boats, with &s;uch
weapons as the urgent occa&s;ion offered. The two animals were &s;oon wounded
in &s;everal places, and the whole &s;ea round was tinctured with their blood.
The whales made &s;e|veral attempts to e&s;cape; and at la&s;t the old one, 
<PB N="189" REF="195"> by its &s;uperior &s;trength, forced over the &s;hallow,
into the depths of the ocean. But though in &s;afety her&s;elf, &s;he could not
bear the danger that awaited her young one; &s;he therefore ru&s;hed in once
more where the &s;maller animal was impri|&s;oned, and re&s;olved, when &s;he
could not protect, at lea&s;t to &s;hare his danger.&mdash;The &s;tory ends
with poetical ju&s;tice; for the tide coming in, brought off both in &s;afety
from their enemies, though not without &s;u&s;taining an infinite num|ber of
wounds in every part.</P>
<P>As to the re&s;t, the di&s;tinctive marks of this tribe are,
that the number of their fins never exceeds three; namely, two pectoral fins,
and one back fin; but in &s;ome &s;orts the la&s;t is want|ing. The&s;e fins
differ very much from tho&s;e of other fi&s;hes, which are formed of &s;traight
&s;pines: the fins of the cetaceous tribe are made up of bones and mu&s;cles;
and the &s;keleton of one of their fins, very much re&s;embles the &s;keleton
of a man's hand. Their tails al&s;o are different from tho&s;e of all other
fi&s;h: they are placed &s;o as to lie flat on the &s;urface of the water;
while the other kinds have them, as we every day &s;ee, upright or edgeways.
This flat po&s;ition of the tail in cetaceous animals, enables them to force
them&s;elves &s;uddenly to the &s;urface of the water to breathe, which they
are con|tinually con&s;trained to do.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="196">Of the&s;e enormous animals, &s;ome are
without teeth, and properly called whales; others have the teeth only in the
lower jaw, and are called, by the French, cachalots: the narwhal has teeth only
in the upper jaw: the dolphin's teeth, as well as tho&s;e of the porpe&s;s and
grampus, are both above and below. The&s;e are the marks that &s;erve to
di&s;tingui&s;h the kinds of this enormous tribe from each other; and the&s;e

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of the Whale, properly &s;o called, and its
Varieties.</HEAD>
<P>IF we compare land animals, in re&s;pect to magnitude, with
tho&s;e of the deep, they will appear contemptible in the competition. It is
probable, indeed, that quadrupedes once ex|i&s;ted much larger than we find
them at pre|&s;ent. From the &s;keletons of &s;ome that have been dug up at
different times, it is evident, that there mu&s;t have been terre&s;trial
animals twice as large as the elephant; but creatures of &s;uch an immen&s;e
bulk required a proportion|able extent of ground for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and, by
being rivals with men for large territory, they mu&s;t have been de&s;troyed in
the conte&s;t.</P>
<P>But it is not only upon land that man has exerted his power of
de&s;troying the larger tribes of animated nature, he has extended his efforts
even into the mid&s;t of the ocean, and has cut off numbers of tho&s;e enormous
animals that had perhaps exi&s;ted for ages. We now no longer hear of whales
two hundred, and two hundred and fifty, feet long, which we are certain were
often &s;een about two centuries ago. They have all <PB N="192" REF="198"> been
de&s;troyed by the &s;kill of mankind, and the &s;pecies is now dwindled into a
race of di|minutive animals, from thirty to about eighty feet long.</P>
<P>The northern &s;eas were once the region to which the
greate&s;t of the&s;e animals re&s;orted; but &s;o great has been the
&s;laughter of whales for more than two ages, that they begin to grow thinner
every day; and tho&s;e that are found there, &s;eem, from their &s;ize, not
come to their full dimen&s;ions. The greate&s;t whales re&s;ort to places where
they have the lea&s;t di|&s;turbance; to tho&s;e &s;eas that are on the
oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the globe, near the &s;outh pole. In that part of the
world, there are &s;till to be &s;een whales that are above an hundred and
&s;ixty feet long; and perhaps even longer might be found in tho&s;e latitudes
near the &s;outh pole, to which we have not as yet ventured.</P>
<P>Taking the whale, however, at the ordinary &s;ize of eighty
feet long and twenty feet high, what an enormous animated ma&s;s mu&s;t it
ap|pear to the &s;pectator! With what amazement mu&s;t it &s;trike him, to
behold &s;o great a creature gambolling in the deep, with the ea&s;e and
agility of the &s;malle&s;t animal, and making its way with incredible
&s;wiftne&s;s! This is a &s;ight which is very common to tho&s;e who frequent
the northern or <PB N="193" REF="199"> &s;outhern ocean. Yet though this be
wonderful, perhaps &s;till greater wonders are concealed in the deep, which we
have not had opportunities of exploring. The&s;e large animals are obliged to
&s;hew them&s;elves in order to take breath; but who knows the &s;ize of
tho&s;e that are fitted to remain for ever under water; and that have been
encrea&s;ing in magnitude for centuries? To believe all that has been &s;aid of
the &s;ea-&s;erpent, or the Kraken, would be credulity; to reject the
po&s;&s;ibility of their exi&s;tence, would be pre|&s;umption.</P>
<P>The Whale is the large&s;t animal of which we have any certain
information; and the va|rious purpo&s;es to which, when taken, its dif|ferent
parts are converted, have brought us tolerably acquainted with its hi&s;tory.
Of the whale, properly &s;o called, there are no le&s;s than &s;even different
kinds; all di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other by their external figure, or
internal conformation. The Great Greenland Whale, without a back-fin, and black
on the back; the Iceland Whale, without a back-fin, and whiti&s;h on the back;
the New England Whale, with a hump on the back; the Whale with &s;ix humps on
the back; the Fin-fi&s;h, with a fin on the back near the tail; the Pike-headed
Whale, and the Round-lipped Whale. All the&s;e differ <PB N="194" REF="200">
from each other in figure, as their names obviou&s;ly imply. They differ al&s;o
&s;omewhat in their manner of living; the fin-fi&s;h having a larger &s;wallow
than the re&s;t, being more active, &s;lender and fierce, and living chiefly
upon herrings. However, they are none of them very voracious; and, if compared
to the Cachalot, that enormous tyrant of the deep, they appear harmle&s;s and
gentle. The hi&s;tory of the re&s;t, therefore, may be comprized under that of
the Great Common Greenland Whale, with which we are be&s;t acquainted.</P>
<P>The Great Greenland Whale is the fi&s;h for taking which there
are &s;uch preparations made in different parts of Europe. It is a large heavy
animal, and the head alone makes a third of its bulk. It is u&s;ually found
from &s;ixty to &s;eventy feet long. The fins on each &s;ide are from five to
eight feet, compo&s;ed of bones and mu&s;cles, and &s;ufficiently &s;trong to
give the great ma&s;s of body which they move, &s;peed and activity. The tail,
which lies flat on the water, is about twenty-four feet broad; and, when the
fi&s;h lies on one &s;ide, its blow is tremendous. The &s;kin is &s;mooth and
black, and, in &s;ome places, marbled with white and yellow; which, running
over the &s;urface, has a very beautiful effect. This marbling is par|ticularly
ob&s;ervable in the fins and the tail. In <PB N="195" REF="201"> the figures
which are thus drawn by Nature, fancy often forms the pictures of trees,
land|&s;capes and hou&s;es. In the tail of one that was thus marbled, Ray tells
us that the number 122 was figured very evenly and exact, as if done with a
pencil.</P>
<P>The whale makes u&s;e only of the tail to ad|vance it&s;elf
forward in the water. This &s;erves as a great oar to pu&s;h its ma&s;s along;
and it is &s;urprizing to &s;ee with what force and celerity its enormous bulk
cuts through the ocean. The fins are only made u&s;e of for turning in the
water, and giving a direction to the velocity impre&s;&s;ed by the tail. The
female al&s;o makes u&s;e of them, when pur&s;ued, to bear off her young,
clapping them on her back, and &s;up|porting them by the fins on each &s;ide
from falling.</P>
<P>The outward or &s;carf &s;kin of the whale is no thicker than
parchment; but this removed, the real &s;kin appears, of about an inch thick,
and covering the fat or blubber that lies beneath: this is from eight to twelve
inches in thickne&s;s; and is, when the fi&s;h is in health, of a beautiful
yellow. The mu&s;cles lie beneath; and the&s;e, like the fle&s;h of
quadrupedes, are very red and tough.</P>
<P>The cleft of the mouth is above twenty feet 
<PB N="196" REF="202"> long, which is near one third of the animal's whole
length; and the upper jaw is furni&s;hed with barbs, that lie, like the pipes
of an organ, the greate&s;t in the middle, and the &s;malle&s;t to the &s;ides.
The&s;e compo&s;e the whale-bone; the longe&s;t &s;pars of which are found to
be not le&s;s than eighteen feet: the &s;horte&s;t, being of no value, are
thrown away. The tongue is almo&s;t immovably fixed to the lower jaw, &s;eeming
one great lump of fat; and, in fact, it fills &s;everal hog&s;heads with
blubber. The eyes are not larger than tho&s;e of an ox; and when the
chry&s;taline humour is dried, it does not appear larger than a pea. They are
placed towards the back of the head, being the mo&s;t convenient &s;ituation
for enabling them to &s;ee both before and behind; as al&s;o to &s;ee over
them, where their food is principally found. They are guarded by eye-lids and
eye-la&s;hes, as in quadrupedes; and they &s;eem to be very
&s;harp-&s;ighted.</P>
<P>Nor is their &s;en&s;e of hearing in le&s;s per|fection; for
they are warned, at great di&s;tances, of any danger preparing again&s;t them.
It would &s;eem as if Nature had de&s;ignedly given them the&s;e advantages, as
they multiply little, in order to continue their kind. It is true indeed, that
the external organ of hearing is not per|ceptible, <PB N="197" REF="203"> for
this might only embarra&s;s them in their natural element; but as &s;oon as the
thin &s;carf &s;kin abovementioned is removed, a black &s;pot is di&s;covered
behind the eye, and under that is the auditory canal, that leads to a regular
apparatus for hearing. In &s;hort, the animal hears the &s;malle&s;t &s;ounds
at very great di&s;tances, and at all times, except when it is &s;pouting
water; which is the time that the fi&s;hers ap|proach to &s;trike it.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;pout-holes or no&s;trils, in all the ceta|ceous
tribe, have been already de&s;cribed: in this whale they are two; one on each
&s;ide the head before the eyes, and crooked, &s;omewhat like the holes on the
belly of a violin. From the&s;e holes this animal blows the water very
fiercely, and with &s;uch a noi&s;e that it roars like a hollow wind, and may
be heard at three miles di&s;tance. When wounded, it then blows more fiercely
than ever, &s;o that it &s;ounds like the roaring of the &s;ea in a great
&s;torm.</P>
<P>We have already ob&s;erved, that the &s;ub&s;tance called
whalebone, is taken from the upper jaw of the animal, and is very different
from the real bones of the whale. The real bones are hard, like tho&s;e of
great land animals, are very porous, and filled with marrow. Two great &s;trong
bones &s;u&s;tain the under lip, lying again&s;t <PB N="198" REF="204"> each
other in the &s;hape of an half-moon: &s;ome of the&s;e are twenty feet long;
they are &s;een in &s;everal gardens &s;et up again&s;t each other, and are
u&s;ually mi&s;taken for the ribs of this animal.</P>
<P>Such is the general conformation and figure of this great
inhabitant of the deep, the preci&s;e anatomy of which has not been yet
a&s;certained. In tho&s;e places where they are caught in greate&s;t abundance,
the &s;ailors are not very curious as to the &s;tructure of the vi&s;cera; and
few anatomi&s;ts care to under|take a ta&s;k, where the operator, in&s;tead of
&s;eparating with a lancet, mu&s;t cut his way with an ax. It is as yet
doubted, therefore, whether the whale, that in mo&s;t points inter|nally
re&s;embles a quadrupede, may not have one great bowel fitted entirely for the
re|ception of air, to &s;upply it, when con&s;trained to keep longer than
u&s;ual at the bottom. The &s;ailors univer&s;ally affirm that it has; and
phi|lo&s;ophers have nothing but the analogy of its parts to oppo&s;e to their
general a&s;&s;ertions.</P>
<P>As the&s;e animals re&s;emble quadrupedes in conformation,
&s;o they bear a &s;trong re&s;emblance in &s;ome of their appetites and
manners. The female joins with the male, as is a&s;&s;erted, <HI>more
humano,</HI> and once in two years feels the acce&s;&s;es of de&s;ire.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="205">Their fidelity to each other exceeds
whatever we are told of even the con&s;tancy of birds. Some fi&s;hers, as
Ander&s;on informs us, having &s;truck one of two whales, a male and a female,
that were in company together, the wounded fi&s;h made a long and terrible
re&s;i&s;tance: it &s;truck down a boat with three men in it, with a &s;ingle
blow of the tail, by which all went to the bottom. The other &s;till attended
its com|panion, and lent it every a&s;&s;i&s;tance; till, at la&s;t, the fi&s;h
that was &s;truck, &s;unk under the number of its wounds; while its faithful
a&s;&s;o|ciate, di&s;daining to &s;urvive the lo&s;s, with great bellowing,
&s;tretched it&s;elf upon the dead fi&s;h, and &s;hared his fate.</P>
<P>The whale goes with young nine or ten months, and is then
fatter than u&s;ual, par|ticularly when near the time of bringing forth. It is
&s;aid that the embryo, when fir&s;t percep|tible, is about &s;eventeen inches
long, and white; but the cub, when excluded, is black, and about ten feet long.
She generally produces one young one, and never above two. When &s;he &s;uckles
her young, &s;he throws her&s;elf on one &s;ide on the &s;urface of the &s;ea,
and the young one attaches it&s;elf to the tate. The brea&s;ts are two;
generally hid within the belly; but &s;he <PB N="200" REF="206"> can produce
them at plea&s;ure, &s;o as to &s;tand forward a foot and an half, or two feet;
and the tates are like tho&s;e of a cow. In &s;ome, the brea&s;ts are white; in
others, &s;peckled; in all, filled with a large quantity of milk, re|&s;embling
that of land animals.</P>
<P>Nothing can exceed the tenderne&s;s of the female for her
offspring; &s;he carries it with her wherever &s;he goes, and, when harde&s;t
pur|&s;ued, keeps it &s;upported between her fins. Even when wounded, &s;he
&s;till cla&s;ps her young one; and when &s;he plunges to avoid danger, takes
it to the bottom; but ri&s;es &s;ooner than u&s;ual, to give it breath
again.</P>
<P>The young ones continue at the brea&s;t for a year; during
which time, they are called by the &s;ailors, <HI>&s;hort-heads.</HI> They are
then extremely fat, and yield above fifty barrels of blubber. The mother, at
the &s;ame time, is equally lean and emaciated. At the age of two years they
are called <HI>&s;tunts,</HI> as they do not thrive much immediately after
quitting the brea&s;t: they then yield &s;carce above twenty, or twenty-four,
barrels of blubber: from that time forward they are called
<HI>&s;kull-fi&s;h,</HI> and their age is wholly unknown.</P>
<P>Every &s;pecies of whale propagates only with tho&s;e of its
own kind, and does not at all min|gle <PB N="201" REF="207"> with the re&s;t:
however, they are generally &s;een in &s;hoals, of different kinds together,
and make their migrations in large companies, from one ocean to another. They
are a gregarious animal, which implies their want of mutual defence again&s;t
the inva&s;ions of &s;maller, but more powerful, fi&s;hes. It &s;eems
a&s;toni&s;hing, therefore, how a &s;hoal of the&s;e enormous animals find
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence together, when it would &s;eem that the &s;upplying even one
with food would require greater plenty than the ocean could furni&s;h. To
encrea&s;e our wonder, we not only &s;ee them herding together, but u&s;ually
find them fatter than any other animals of what&s;oever ele|ment. We likewi&s;e
know that they cannot &s;wallow large fi&s;hes, as their throat is &s;o
nar|row, that an animal larger than an herring could not enter. How then do
they &s;ub&s;i&s;t and grow &s;o fat? A &s;mall in&s;ect which is &s;een
floating in tho&s;e &s;eas, and which Linnaeus terms the Medu&s;a, is
&s;ufficient for this &s;upply. The&s;e in&s;ects are black, and of the &s;ize
of a &s;mall bean, and are &s;ometimes &s;een floating in clu&s;ters on the
&s;ur|face of the water. They are of a round form, like &s;nails in a box, but
they have wings, which are &s;o tender that it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to
touch them without breaking. The&s;e &s;erve rather for &s;wimming than flying;
and the little <PB N="202" REF="208"> animal is called by the Icelanders, the
Walfi&s;|choas, which &s;ignifies the whale's provender. They have the ta&s;te
of raw mu&s;cles, and have the &s;mell of burnt &s;ugar. The&s;e are the food
of the whale, which it is &s;een to draw up in great numbers with its huge
jaws, and to brui&s;e between its barbs, which are always found with &s;everal
of the&s;e &s;ticking among them.</P>
<P>This is the &s;imple food of the great Green|land whale; it
pur&s;ues no other animal, leads an inoffen&s;ive life in its element, and is
harmle&s;s in proportion to its &s;trength to do mi&s;chief. There &s;eems to
be an analogy between its manners and tho&s;e of the elephant. They are both
the &s;tronge&s;t and the large&s;t animals in their re&s;pective ele|ments;
neither offer injury, but are terrible when provoked to re&s;entment. The
fin-fi&s;h indeed, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, differs from the great whale in this
particular, as it &s;ub&s;i&s;ts chiefly upon herrings, great &s;hoals of which
it is often &s;een driving before it. Yet even the &s;wallow of this fi&s;h is
not very large, if compared to the cachalot tribe; and its ravages are but
&s;ports in compari&s;on. The &s;tomach and in|te&s;tines of all the&s;e
animals, when opened, &s;eldom have any thing in them, except a &s;oft unctuous
&s;ub&s;tance, of a browni&s;h colour; and their excrements are of a &s;hining
red.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="209">As the whale is an inoffen&s;ive animal,
it is not to be wondered that it has many enemies, willing to take advantage of
its di&s;po&s;ition, and inaptitude for combat. There is a &s;mall ani|mal, of
the &s;hell-fi&s;h kind, called the Whale|lou&s;e, that &s;ticks to its body,
as we &s;ee &s;hells &s;ticking to the foul bottom of a &s;hip. This
in&s;inuates it&s;elf chiefly under the fins; and what|ever efforts the great
animal makes, it &s;till keeps its hold, and lives upon the fat, which it is
provided with in&s;truments to arrive at.</P>
<P>The &s;word-fi&s;h, however, is the whale's mo&s;t terrible
enemy. 
<Q REND="inline">"At the &s;ight of this little animal," &s;ays
Ander&s;on, "the whale &s;eems agitated in an extraordinary manner; leaping
from the water as if with affright: wherever it appears, the whale perceives it
at a di&s;tance, and flies from it in the op|po&s;ite direction. I have been
my&s;elf," con|tinues he, "a &s;pectator of their terrible encounter. The whale
has no in&s;trument of defence except the tail; with that it en|deavours to
&s;trike the enemy; and a &s;ingle blow taking place, would effectually
de&s;troy its adver&s;ary: but the &s;word-fi&s;h is as active as the other is
&s;trong, and ea&s;ily avoids the &s;troke; then bounding into the air, it
falls upon its great &s;ubjacent enemy, and endea|vours <PB N="204" REF="210">
not to pierce with its pointed beak, but to cut with its toothed edges. The
&s;ea all about is &s;een dyed with blood, proceeding from the wounds of the
whale; while the enor|mous animal vainly endeavours to reach its invader, and
&s;trikes with its tail again&s;t the &s;urface of the water, making a report
at each blow louder than the noi&s;e of a cannon."</Q></P>
<P>There is &s;till another and more powerful enemy called, by
the fi&s;hermen of New Eng|land, the Killer. This is it&s;elf a cetaceous
animal, armed with &s;trong and powerful teeth. A number of the&s;e are &s;aid
to &s;urround a whale, in the &s;ame manner as dogs get round a bull. Some
attack it with their teeth behind; others attempt it before; until, at la&s;t,
the great animal is torn down, and its tongue is &s;aid to be the only part
they devour when they have made it their prey. They are &s;aid to be of &s;uch
great &s;trength, that one of them alone was known to &s;top a dead whale that
&s;everal boats were towing along, and drag it from among them to the
bottom.</P>
<P>But of all the enemies of the&s;e enormous fi&s;hes, man is
the greate&s;t: he alone de&s;troys more in a year than the re&s;t in an age,
and actually has thinned their numbers in that part of the world where they are
chiefly &s;ought. The great re&s;ort of the&s;e animals, was found to be 
<PB N="205" REF="211"> on the inho&s;pitable &s;hores of Spitzbergen; where the
di&s;tance of the voyage, the coldne&s;s of the climate, the terrors of the icy
&s;ea, and, &s;till more, their own formidable bulk, might have been expected
to protect them from human injury. But all the&s;e were but &s;light barriers
again&s;t man's arts, his courage, and his nece&s;&s;ities. The European
&s;hips, &s;oon after the improvement of navigation, found the way into tho&s;e
&s;eas; and as early as the beginning of the fourteenth cen|tury, the
Bi&s;cayneers were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a very con&s;iderable trade to the
coa&s;ts of Greenland. The Dutch and the Engli&s;h followed them thi|ther, and
&s;oon took that branch of commerce out of their hands. The Engli&s;h commenced
the bu|&s;ine&s;s about the beginning of the &s;eventeenth cen|tury; and the
town of Hull had the honour of fir&s;t attempting that profitable branch of
trade. But, at pre&s;ent, it &s;eems upon the decline, as the quantity of
fi&s;h are &s;o greatly reduced, by the con&s;tant capture for &s;uch a va&s;t
length of time. It is now &s;aid, that the fi&s;hers, from a defect of whales,
apply them&s;elves to the &s;eal-fi&s;hery; yet, as the&s;e animals are
extremely timorous, they will &s;oon be induced to quit tho&s;e &s;hores, where
they meet &s;uch frequent di&s;turbance and danger. The poor natives of
Greenland them&s;elves, who u&s;ed to feed upon <PB N="206" REF="212"> the
whale, are dimini&s;hing, in proportion as their &s;u&s;tenance is removed;
and, it is probable; that the revolution of a few years will &s;ee that
exten&s;ive coa&s;t totally de&s;erted by its inhabitants; as it is already
nearly de&s;erted by the whales.</P>
<P>The art of taking whales, like mo&s;t others, is much improved
by time, and differs in many re&s;pects from that practi&s;ed by the
Bi&s;cayneers; when they fir&s;t frequented the icy &s;ea. But as the
de&s;cription of their methods is the lea&s;t complicated, and con&s;equently
the ea&s;ie&s;t un|der&s;tood, it will be be&s;t &s;uited to our purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>For this navigation, the Bi&s;cayneers, in fa|vourable
&s;ea&s;ons, fitted out thirty &s;hips, of two hundred and fifty tons each,
with fifty choice men a-piece, and a few boys. The&s;e were &s;tored with &s;ix
month's provi&s;ion; and each &s;hip had its boats, which were to be
&s;erviceable when come to the place of duty. When arrived at the part where
the whales are expected to pa&s;s to the &s;outhward, they always keep their
fails &s;et, and a &s;ailor is placed at the ma&s;t head, to give information
when he &s;pies a whale. As &s;oon as he di&s;covers one, the whole crew are
in&s;tantly in employment: they fit out their boats, and row away to where the
whale was &s;een. The harpooner, who is to &s;trike the fi&s;h, &s;tands at the
prow of the boat, with an harpoon <PB N="207" REF="213"> or javelin in his
hand, five or &s;ix feet long, pointed with &s;teel like the barb of an arrow,
of a triangular &s;hape. As this per&s;on's place is that of the greate&s;t
dexterity, &s;o al&s;o it is of the greate&s;t danger: the whale &s;ometimes
over|turns the boat with a blow of its tail, and &s;ometimes drives again&s;t
it with fury. In ge|neral, however, the animal &s;eems to &s;leep on the
&s;urface of the water; while the boat ap|proaching, the harpooner &s;tands
aloft, and, with his harpoon tied to a cord of &s;everal hun|dred fathom
length, darts it into the animal, and then rows as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible away.
It is for &s;ome time before the whale &s;eems to feel the blow; the
in&s;trument has u&s;ually pierced no deeper than the fat, and that being
in&s;en&s;ible, the animal continues for a while motionle&s;s; but &s;oon
rouzed from its &s;eeming lethargy, as the &s;haft continues to pierce deeper
and deeper into the mu&s;cular fle&s;h, it flies off with amazing rapidity. In
the mean time, the harpoon &s;ticks in its &s;ide; while the rope, which is
coiled up in the boat, and runs upon a &s;wivel, lengthens as the whale
recedes, but &s;till &s;hews the part of the deep to which it has retreated.
The cord is coiled up with great care; for &s;uch is the rapidity with which it
runs off, that if it was but the lea&s;t checked, as it yields with the
animal's retreat, <PB N="208" REF="214"> it would infallibly over&s;et the
boat, and the crew would go to the bottom. It &s;ometimes happens al&s;o, that
the rapidity with which it runs over the &s;wivel at the edge of the boat,
heats it, and it would infallibly take fire, did not a man &s;tand continually
with a wet mop in his hand, to cool the &s;wivel as the cord runs. The whale
having dived to a con&s;iderable depth, remains at the bottom, &s;ometimes for
near half an hour, with the harpoon in its body, and then ri&s;es to take
breath, expecting the danger over: but the in&s;tant it appears, they are all
with their boats ready to receive it, and fling their harpoons into its body:
the animal again dives and again ri&s;es, while they repeat their blows. The
&s;hip follows in full &s;ail, like all the re&s;t, never lo&s;ing &s;ight of
the boats; and ready to lend them a&s;&s;i&s;tance; the whole ocean &s;eems
dyed in blood. Thus they renew their attacks, till the whale begins to be quite
en|feebled and &s;pent, when they plunge their longer &s;pears into various
parts of its body, and the enormous animal expires. When it is dead, to prevent
it from &s;inking, they tie it with a &s;trong iron chain to the &s;ide of the
boat, and either cut it up in pieces, and carry it home in that manner, or
extract the oil from the blubber on &s;hip-board.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="215">Such is the manner in which the&s;e
fi&s;h were taken in the beginning; but &s;ucceeding arts have improved the
method, and the harpoon is now thrown by; a machine being u&s;ed which inflicts
a deeper wound, and &s;trikes the ani|mal with much greater certainty: there
are better methods for extracting the oil, and properer machines for cutting
the animal up, than were u&s;ed in the early fi&s;heries. But as an account of
this belongs to the hi&s;tory of art, and not of nature, we mu&s;t be
con|tented, with ob&s;erving, that &s;everal parts of this animal, and all but
the inte&s;tines and the bones, are turned to very good account; not only the
oil, but the greaves from which it is &s;eparated. The barbs al&s;o were an
article of great profit; but have &s;unk in their price &s;ince women no longer
u&s;e them to &s;well out their petticoats with whale-bone. The fle&s;h of this
animal is al&s;o a dainty to &s;ome nations; and even the French &s;ea-men are
now and then found to dre&s;s and u&s;e it as their ordinary diet at &s;ea. It
is &s;aid, by the Engli&s;h and Dutch &s;ailors, to be hard and ill-ta&s;ted;
but the French a&s;&s;ert the contrary; and the &s;avages of Greenland, as well
as tho&s;e near the &s;outh pole, are fond of it to di&s;traction. They eat the
fle&s;h, and drink the oil, which is a fir&s;t rate delicacy. The find|ing 
<PB N="210" REF="216"> a dead whale is an adventure con&s;idered among the
fortunate circum&s;tances of their wretched lives. They make their abode
be&s;ide it; and &s;eldom remove till they have left no|thing but the
bones.</P>
<P>Jacob&s;on, whom we quoted before in the Hi&s;tory of Birds,
where he de&s;cribes his coun|trymen of the i&s;land of Feroe as living a part
of the year upon &s;alted gulls, tells us al&s;o, that they are very fond of
&s;alted whale's fle&s;h. The fat of the head they &s;ea&s;on with bay &s;alt,
and then hang it up to dry in the chimney. He thinks it ta&s;tes as well as fat
bacon; and the lean, which they boil, is, in his opinion, not inferior to beef.
I fancy poor Jacob&s;on would make but an indifferent ta&s;ter at one of our
city fea&s;ts!</P>

<PB N="211" REF="217">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of the Narwhal.</HEAD>
<P>FROM whales that entirely want teeth, we come to &s;uch as
have them in the upper jaw only; and in this cla&s;s there is found but one,
the Narwhal, or Sea-unicorn. This fi&s;h is not &s;o large as the whale, not
being above &s;ixty feet long. Its body is &s;lenderer than that of the whale,
and its fat not in &s;o great abundance. But this great animal is
&s;uf|ficiently di&s;tingui&s;hed from all others of the deep by its tooth or
teeth, which &s;tand pointing directly forward from the upper jaw, and are from
nine to fourteen feet long. In all the va|riety of weapons with which Nature
has armed her various tribes, there is not one &s;o large or &s;o formidable as
this. This terrible weapon is generally found &s;ingle; and &s;ome are of
opinion that the animal is furni&s;hed but with one by nature; but there is at
pre&s;ent the &s;kull of a narwhal at the Stadthou&s;e at Am&s;terdam with two
teeth; which plainly proves that in &s;ome animals, at lea&s;t, this
in|&s;trument is double. It is even a doubt whether it may not be &s;o in all;
and that the narwhal's <PB N="212" REF="218"> wanting a tooth is only an
accident which it has met with in the encounters it is obliged daily to be
engaged in. Yet it mu&s;t be owned of the&s;e that are taken only with one
tooth, there &s;eems no &s;ocket nor no remains of any other upon the
oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the jaw, but all is plain and even. However this be, the
tooth, or, as &s;ome are plea&s;ed to call it, the horn of the narwhal is the
mo&s;t terrible of all natural in&s;truments of de&s;truction. It is as
&s;traight as an arrow, about the thickne&s;s of the &s;mall of a man's leg,
wreathed in the manner we &s;ome|times &s;ee twi&s;ted bars of iron; it tapers
to a &s;harp point; and is whiter, heavier, and harder than ivory. It is
generally &s;een to &s;pring from the left &s;ide of the head directly forward
in a &s;traight line with the body; and its root enters into the &s;ocket above
a foot and an half. In a &s;kull to be &s;een at Hamburgh there are two teeth,
which are each above &s;even feet long, and are eight inches in circumference.
When the animal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the&s;e formidable weapons is urged to
employ them, it drives di|rectly forward again&s;t the enemy with its teeth,
that, like portended &s;pears, pierce whatever &s;tands before them.</P>
<P>The extreme length of the&s;e in&s;truments have induced
&s;ome to con&s;ider them rather as <PB N="213" REF="219"> horns than teeth;
but they in every re&s;pect re&s;emble the tu&s;ks of the boar and the
elephant. They grow, as in them, from &s;ockets in the upper jaw; they have the
&s;olidity of the harde&s;t bone, and far &s;urpa&s;s ivory in all its
qualities. The &s;ame error has led others to &s;uppo&s;e, that as among
quadrupedes the female was often found without horns, &s;o the&s;e
in&s;truments of defence were only to be found in the male; but this has been
more than once refuted by actual experience; both &s;exes are found armed in
this manner; the horn is &s;ometimes found wreathed and &s;ometimes &s;mooth;
&s;ometimes a little bent and &s;ometimes &s;traight; but always &s;trong,
deeply fixed, and &s;harply pointed.</P>
<P>Yet, notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e appointments for combat,
the&s;e long and pointed tu&s;ks, amazing &s;trength, and unmatchable celerity,
the narwhal is one of the mo&s;t harmle&s;s and peaceful inhabitants of the
ocean. It is &s;een con&s;tantly and inoffen&s;ively &s;porting among the other
great mon&s;ters of the deep, no way at|tempting to injure them, but plea&s;ed
in their company The Greenlanders call the narwhal the fore-runner of the
whale; for wherever it is &s;een, the whale is &s;hortly after &s;ure to
follow. This may ari&s;e as well from the natural pa&s;&s;ion for &s;ociety in
the&s;e animals as from both living <PB N="214" REF="220"> upon the &s;ame
food, which are the in&s;ects de|&s;cribed in the preceding chapter. The&s;e
powerful fi&s;hes make war upon no other living crea|ture; and, though
furni&s;hed with in&s;truments to &s;pread general de&s;truction, are as
innocent and as peaceful as a drove of oxen. Nay, &s;o re|gardle&s;s are they
of their own weapons, and &s;o utterly unmindful to keep them in repair for
engagement, that they are con&s;tantly &s;een co|vered over with weeds,
&s;lough, and all the filth of the &s;ea; they &s;eem rather con&s;idered as an
impediment than a defence.</P>
<P>The manners and appetites both of the nar|whal and the great
whale are entirely &s;imilar; they both alike want teeth for chewing, and are
obliged to live upon in&s;ects; they both are peaceable and harmle&s;s, and
always rather fly than &s;eek the combat. The narwhal, however, has a much
narrower gape than the great whale, and therefore does not want the u&s;e of
barbs to keep in its food when once &s;ucked into the mouth. It is al&s;o much
&s;wifter, and would never be taken by the fi&s;herman but for tho&s;e very
tu&s;ks, which at fir&s;t appear to be its principal defence. The&s;e animals,
as was &s;aid, being fond of living to|gether, are always &s;een in herds of
&s;everal at a time; and whenever they are attacked, they crowd together in
&s;uch a manner, that they are <PB N="215" REF="221"> mutually embara&s;&s;ed
by their tu&s;ks. By the&s;e they are often locked together, and are pre|vented
from &s;inking to the bottom. It &s;eldom happens, therefore, but the
fi&s;hermen make &s;ure of one or two of the hindmo&s;t, which very well reward
their trouble.</P>
<P>It is from the extraordinary circum&s;tance of the teeth,
therefore, that this fi&s;h demands a di&s;tinct hi&s;tory; and &s;uch has been
the curio&s;ity of mankind, and their de&s;ire to procure them, that a century
ago they were con&s;idered as the greate&s;t rarity in the world. At that time
the art of catching whales was not known; and mankind &s;aw few, except &s;uch
as were &s;tranded on the coa&s;ts by accident. The tooth of the narwhal,
therefore, was a&s;cribed to a very dif|ferent animal from that which really
bore it. Among other fo&s;&s;il &s;ub&s;tances they were &s;ome|times dug up;
and the narwhal being utterly unknown, naturali&s;ts &s;oon found a
terre&s;trial owner. They were thought to be the horns of unicorns, an animal
de&s;cribed by Pliny as re&s;embling an hor&s;e, and with one &s;traight horn
darting forward from the middle of its forehead. The&s;e teeth were, therefore,
con&s;idered as a &s;trong te&s;timony in favour of that hi&s;torian's
veracity, and were &s;hewn among the mo&s;t pre|cious remains of antiquity.
Even for &s;ome <PB N="216" REF="222"> time after the narwhal was known, the
deceit was continued, as tho&s;e who were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a tooth &s;old
it to great advantage. But at pre|&s;ent they are too well known to deceive
any, and are only &s;hewn for what they really are; their curio&s;ity
encrea&s;ing in proportion to their weight and their &s;ize.</P>

<PB N="217" REF="223">
<HEAD>CHAP. V. Of the Cachalot and its Varieties.</HEAD>
<P>THE Cachalot, which has generally gone under the name of the
Spermaceti Whale, till Mr. Penant very properly made the di&s;tinction, by
borrowing its name from the French, has &s;e|veral teeth in the under-jaw, but
none in the upper. As there are no le&s;s than &s;even di|&s;tinctions among
whales, &s;o al&s;o there are the &s;ame number of di&s;tinctions in the tribe
we are de&s;cribing. The cachalot with two fins and a black back; the cachalot
with two fins and a whiti&s;h back; that with a &s;pout in the neck; that with
the &s;pout in the &s;nout; that with three fins and &s;harp pointed teeth;
that with three fins and &s;harp edged teeth; and la&s;tly, the ca|chalot with
three fins and flatted teeth.</P>
<P>This tribe is not of &s;uch enormous &s;ize as the whale,
properly &s;o called, not being above &s;ixty feet long and &s;ixteen feet
high. In con|&s;equence of their being more &s;lender, they are much more
active than the common whale; they remain a longer time at the bottom; and
afford a &s;maller quantity of oil. As in the common whale the head was &s;een
to make a third part of its bulk, &s;o in this &s;pecies the 
<PB N="218" REF="224"> head is &s;o large as to make one half of the whole. The
tongue of this animal is &s;mall; but the throat is very formidable; and with
very great ea&s;e it could &s;wallow an ox. In the &s;tomach of the whale
&s;carce any thing is to be found; but in that of the cachalot there are loads
of fi&s;h of different kinds; &s;ome whole, &s;ome half dige&s;ted, &s;ome
&s;mall, and others eight or nine feet long. The cachalot is there|fore as
de&s;tructive among le&s;&s;er fi&s;hes as the whale is harmle&s;s; and can at
one gulp &s;wallow a &s;hoal of fi&s;hes down its enormous gullet. Linnaeus
tells us that this fi&s;h pur&s;ues and ter|rifies the dolphins and porpoi&s;es
&s;o much, as often to drive them on &s;hore.</P>
<P>But, how formidable &s;oever this fi&s;h may be to its fellows
of the deep, it is by far the mo&s;t valuable, and the mo&s;t &s;ought after by
man, as it contains two very precious drugs, &s;permaceti and amber-grea&s;e.
The u&s;e of the&s;e, either for the purpo&s;es of luxury or medicine, is &s;o
uni|ver&s;al, that the capture of this animal, that alone &s;upplies them,
turns out to very great advan|tage, particularly &s;ince the art has been found
out of converting all the oil of this animal, as well as the brain, into that
&s;ub&s;tance called &s;permaceti.</P>
<P>This &s;ub&s;tance, as it is naturally formed, is 
<PB N="219" REF="225"> found in the head of the animal, and is no other than
the brain. The outward &s;kin of the head being taken off, a covering of fat
offers about three inches thick; and under that, in&s;tead of a bony &s;kull,
the animal has only another thick &s;kin, that &s;erves for a covering and
defence of the brain. The fir&s;t cavity, or chamber, of the brain, is filled
with that &s;permaceti which is &s;uppo&s;ed of the greate&s;t purity and
highe&s;t value. From this cavity there is generally drawn about &s;even
barrels of the cleare&s;t &s;per|maceti, that thrown upon water coagulates like
chee&s;e. Below this there is another chamber ju&s;t over the gullet, which is
about &s;even feet high; and this al&s;o contains the drug, but of le&s;s
value. It is di&s;tributed in this cavity like honey in a hive, in &s;mall
cells, &s;eparated from each other by a membrane like the inner &s;kin of an
egg. In proportion as the oily &s;ub&s;tance is drawn away from this part it
fills anew from every part of the body; and from this is ge|nerally obtained
about nine barrels of oil. Be|&s;ides this, the &s;pinal marrow, which is about
as thick as a man's thigh, and reaches all along the back-bone to the tail,
where it is not thicker than one's finger, affords no incon&s;iderable
quantity.</P>
<P>This &s;ub&s;tance, which is u&s;ed in the compo|&s;ition 
<PB N="220" REF="226"> of many medicines, rather to give them con&s;i&s;tence
than efficacy, was at fir&s;t &s;old at a very high price, both from the many
virtues a&s;cribed to it and the &s;mall quantity that the cachalot was capable
of &s;upplying; at pre&s;ent, the price is greatly fallen; fir&s;t, becau&s;e
its ef|ficacy in medicine is found to be very &s;mall; and again becau&s;e the
whole oil of the fi&s;h is very ea&s;ily convertible into &s;permaceti. This is
performed by boiling it with a lea of pot-a&s;h, and hardening it in the manner
of &s;oap. Candles are now made of it, which are &s;ub&s;tituted for wax, and
&s;old much cheaper; &s;o that we need not fear having our &s;permaceti
adulterated in the manner &s;ome medical books caution us to beware of; for
they carefully guard us again&s;t having our &s;permaceti adulterated with
virgin's wax.</P>
<P>As to the amber grea&s;e which is &s;ometimes found in this
whale, it was long con&s;idered as a &s;ub&s;tance found floating on the
&s;urface of the &s;ea; but time, that reveals the &s;ecrets of the mercenary,
has di&s;covered that it chiefly be|longs to this animal. The name, which has
been improperly given to the former &s;ub&s;tance, &s;eems more ju&s;tly to
belong to this; for the amber grea&s;e is found in the place where the
&s;eminal ve&s;&s;els are u&s;ually &s;ituated in other <PB N="221" REF="227">
animals. It is found in a bag of three or four feet long, in round lumps, from
one to twenty pounds weight, floating in a fluid rather thinner than oil, and
of a yellowi&s;h colour. There are never &s;een more than four at a time in one
of the&s;e bags; and that which weighed twenty pounds, and which was the
large&s;t ever &s;een, was found &s;ingle. The&s;e balls of amber grea&s;e are
not found in all fi&s;hes of this kind, but chiefly in the olde&s;t and
&s;tronge&s;t. The u&s;es of this medicine for the purpo&s;es of luxury and as
a perfume are well known; though upon &s;ome &s;ubjects ignorance is preferable
to information.</P>

never exceeds twenty feet. It may al&s;o be di|&s;tingui&s;hed by the
flatne&s;s of its head, which re&s;embles a boat turned up&s;ide down. The
porpus re&s;embles the grampus in mo&s;t things except the &s;nout, which is
not above eight feet long; its &s;nout al&s;o more re&s;embles that of an hog.
The dolphin has a &s;trong re&s;emblance to the porpus, except that its &s;nout
is longer and more pointed. They have all fins on the back; they all have heads
very large, like the re&s;t of of the whale-kind; and re&s;emble each other in
their appetites, their mannners, and conforma|tions; being equally voracious,
active, and roving.</P>
<P>The great agility of the&s;e animals prevents their often
being taken. They &s;eldom remain a moment above water; &s;ometimes, indeed,
their too eager pur&s;uits expo&s;e them to danger; and a &s;hoal of herrings
often allures them out of <PB N="223" REF="229"> their depth. In &s;uch a
ca&s;e, the hungry animal continues to flounder in the &s;hallows till knocked
on the head, or till the retiring tide &s;ea&s;onably comes to its relief. But
all this tribe, and the dolphin in particular, are not le&s;s &s;wift than
de&s;tructive. No fi&s;h could e&s;cape them, but from the aukward po&s;ition
of the mouth, which is placed in a manner under the head: yet, even with
the&s;e di&s;advantages, their depredations are &s;o great, that they have been
ju&s;tly &s;tiled the plunderers of the deep.</P>
<P>What could induce the ancients to a predi|lection in favour of
the&s;e animals, particularly the dolphin, it is not ea&s;y to account for.
Hi|&s;torians and philo&s;ophers &s;eem to have con|tended who &s;hould invent
the greate&s;t number of fables concerning them. The dolphin was celebrated in
the earlie&s;t time for its fondne&s;s to the human race, and was
di&s;tingui&s;hed by the epithets of the boy-loving and philan|thropi&s;t.
Scarce an accident could happen at &s;ea but the dolphin offered him&s;elf to
convey the unfortunate to &s;hore. The mu&s;ician flung into the &s;ea by
pirates, the boy taking an airing into the mid&s;t of the &s;ea, and returning
again in &s;afety, were obliged to the dolphin for its &s;er|vices. It is not
ea&s;y, I &s;ay, to a&s;&s;ign a cau&s;e why the ancients &s;hould thus have
invented &s;o <PB N="224" REF="230"> many fables in their favour. The figure of
the&s;e animals is far from prejudicing us in their intere&s;ts; their extreme
rapacity tends &s;till le&s;s to endear them: I know nothing that can
re|concile them to man and excite his prejudices, except that when taken they
&s;ometimes have a plaintiff moan, with which they continue to expre&s;s their
pain till they expire. This, at fir&s;t, might have excited human pity; and
that might have produced affection. At pre&s;ent, the&s;e fi&s;hes are regarded
even by the vulgar in a very different light; their appearance is far from
being e&s;teemed a favourable omen by the &s;ea-men; and from their boundings,
&s;prings, and frolics in the water, experience has taught the mariners to
prepare for a &s;torm.</P>
<P>But it is not to one circum&s;tance only that the ancients
have confined their fabulous reports concerning the&s;e animals; as from their
leaps out of their element, they a&s;&s;ume a temporary curvature, which is by
no means their natural figure in the water, the old painters and &s;culptors
have univer&s;ally drawn them wrong. A dol|phin is &s;carce ever exhibited by
the ancients in a &s;traight &s;hape, but curved, in the po&s;ition which they
&s;ometimes appear in when exerting their force; and the poets too have adopted
the general error. Even Pliny, the be&s;t natu|rali&s;t, <PB N="225" REF="231">
has a&s;&s;erted, that they in&s;tantly die when taken out of the water; but
Rondelet, on the contrary, a&s;&s;ures us, that he has &s;een a dolphin carried
alive from Montpellier to Lyons.</P>
<P>The moderns have more ju&s;t notions of the&s;e animals; and
have got over the many fables, which every day's experience contra|dicts.
Indeed their numbers are &s;o great, and, though &s;hy, they are &s;o often
taken, that &s;uch peculiarities, if they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any, would
have been long &s;ince a&s;certained. They are found, the porpe&s;s
e&s;pecially, in &s;uch va&s;t numbers, in all parts of the &s;ea that
&s;urrounds this kingdom, that they are &s;ometimes noxious to &s;eamen, when
they &s;ail in &s;mall ve&s;&s;els. In &s;ome places they almo&s;t darken the
water as they ri&s;e to take breath, and particularly before bad weather are
much agitated, &s;wimming again&s;t the wind, and tumbling about with
un|u&s;ual violence.</P>
<P>Whether the&s;e motions be the gambols of plea&s;ure, or the
agitations of terror, is not well known. It is mo&s;t probable that they dread
tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons of turbulence, when the le&s;&s;er fi&s;hes &s;hrink to the
bottom, and their prey no longer offers in &s;ufficient abundance. In times of
fairer weather, they are &s;een herding together, and pur&s;uing &s;hoals of
various fi&s;h <PB N="226" REF="232"> with great impetuo&s;ity. Their method of
hunting their game, if it may be &s;o called, is to follow in a pack, and thus
give each other mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance. At that &s;ea&s;on when the mackarel,
the herring, the &s;almon, and other fi&s;h of pa&s;&s;age, begin to make their
ap|pearance, the cetaceous tribes are &s;een fierce in the pur&s;uit; urging
their prey from one creek or bay to another, deterring them from the
&s;hallows, driving them towards each other's ambu&s;h, and u&s;ing a greater
variety of arts than hounds are &s;een to exert in pur&s;uing the hare.
However, the porpe&s;s not only &s;eeks for prey near the &s;urface, but often
de&s;cends to the bottom in &s;earch of &s;and-eels and &s;ea|worms, which it
roots out of the &s;and with its no&s;e, in the manner hogs harrow up the
fields for food. For this purpo&s;e, the no&s;e projects a little, is &s;horter
and &s;tronger than that of the dolphin; and the neck is furni&s;hed with very
&s;trong mu&s;cles, which enable it the readier to turn up the &s;and.</P>
<P>But it &s;ometimes happens, that the impe|tuo&s;ity, or the
hunger, of the&s;e animals, in their u&s;ual pur&s;uits, urges them beyond the
limits of &s;afety. The fi&s;hermen, who extend their long nets for pilchards,
on the coa&s;ts of Cornwall, have &s;ometimes an unwelcome cap|ture 
<PB N="227" REF="233"> in one of the&s;e. Their feeble nets, which are
calculated only for taking &s;maller prey, &s;uffer an univer&s;al laceration,
from the efforts of this &s;trong animal to e&s;cape; and if it be not knocked
on the head, before it has had time to flounder, the nets are de&s;troyed, and
the fi&s;hery interrupted. There is nothing, therefore, they &s;o much dread,
as the entangling a por|pe&s;s; and they do every thing to intimidate the
animal from approaching.</P>
<P>Indeed, the&s;e creatures are &s;o violent in the pur&s;uit of
their prey, that they &s;ometimes follow a &s;hoal of &s;mall fi&s;hes up a
fre&s;h-water river, from whence they find no &s;mall difficulty to return. We
have often &s;een them taken in the Thames at London, both above the bridges
and below them. It is curious enough to ob&s;erve with what activity they avoid
their pur&s;uers, and what little time they require to fetch breath above the
water. The manner of killing them is for four or five boats to &s;pread over
the part of the river in which they are &s;een, and with fire-arms to &s;hoot
at them the in&s;tant they ri&s;e above the water. The fi&s;h being thus for
&s;ome time kept in agitation, requires to come to the &s;urface at quicker
intervals, and thus affords the mark&s;men more frequent opportunities.</P>
<P>When the porpe&s;s is taken, it becomes no 
<PB N="228" REF="234"> incon&s;iderable capture, as it yields a very large
quantity of oil; and the lean of &s;ome, particu|larly if the animal be young,
is &s;aid to be as well ta&s;ted as veal. The inhabitants of Norway prepare
from the eggs found in the body of this fi&s;h, a kind of caviar, which is
&s;aid to be very delicate &s;auce, or good when even eaten with bread. There
is a fi&s;hery for porpe&s;s along the we&s;tern i&s;les of Scotland during the
&s;ummer &s;ea&s;on, when they abound on that &s;hore; and this branch of
indu&s;try turns to good advantage.</P>
<P>As for the re&s;t, we are told, that the&s;e ani|mals go with
young ten months; that, like the whale, they &s;eldom bring forth above one at
a time, and that in the mid&s;t of &s;ummer: that they live to a con&s;iderable
age; though &s;ome &s;ay not above twenty five or thirty years; and they
&s;leep with the &s;nout above water. They &s;eem to po&s;&s;e&s;s, in a degree
proportioned to their bulk, the manners of whales; and the hi&s;tory of one
&s;pecies of cetaceous animals will, in a great mea&s;ure, &s;erve for all the
re&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>PART II. OF CARTILAGINOUS FISHES.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="231" REF="236">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of Cartilaginous Fi&s;hes in General.</HEAD>
<P>WE have &s;een that fi&s;hes of the cetaceous kind bear a
&s;trong re&s;emblance to quadrupedes in their conformation; tho&s;e of the
cartilaginous kinds are one remove &s;eparated from them: they form the &s;hade
that completes the imper|ceptible gradations of nature.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t great di&s;tinction they exhibit is, in having
cartilages or gri&s;tles in&s;tead of bones. The cetaceous tribes have their
bones entirely re&s;embling tho&s;e of quadrupedes, thick, white, and filled
with marrow: tho&s;e of the &s;pinous kind, on the contrary, have &s;mall
&s;lender bones, with points re&s;embling thorns, and generally &s;olid
throughout. Fi&s;hes of the cartilaginous kinds have their bones always &s;oft
and yielding; and age, that hardens the bones of other ani|mals, rather
contributes &s;till more to &s;often theirs. The &s;ize of all fi&s;hes
encrea&s;es with age; but from the pliancy of the bones in this tribe, they
&s;eem to have no bounds placed to their dimen&s;ions: and it is &s;uppo&s;ed
that they grow larger every day till they die.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="237">They have other differences, more
obviou&s;ly di&s;cernible. We have ob&s;erved, that the ceta|ceous tribes had
lungs like quadrupedes, an heart with its partition in the &s;ame manner, and
an apparatus for hearing; on the other hand we mentioned, that the &s;pinous
kinds had no organs of hearing, no lungs to breathe through, and no partition
in the heart; but that their cold red blood was circulated by the means of the
impul&s;e made upon their gills by the water. Cartilaginous fi&s;hes unite both
the&s;e &s;y&s;tems in their conformation: like the cetaceous tribes, they have
organs of hearing, and lungs; like the &s;pinous kinds, they have gills, and an
heart without a partition. Thus po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a two-fold power of
breathing, &s;ometimes by means of their lungs, &s;ometimes by that of their
gills, they &s;eem to unite all the advantages of which their &s;ituation is
capable, and drawing from both elements, every aid to their nece&s;&s;ities or
their enjoyments.</P>
<P>This double capacity of breathing in the&s;e animals, is one
of the mo&s;t remarkable features in the hi&s;tory of nature. The apertures by
which they breathe, are &s;omewhere placed about the head; either beneath, as
in flat fi&s;h; on the &s;ides, as in &s;harks; or on the top of the head, as
in pipe-fi&s;h. To the&s;e apertures are the gills <PB N="233" REF="238">
affixed, but without any bone to open and &s;hut them, as in &s;pinous
fi&s;hes; from which, by this mark, they may be ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed,
though otherwi&s;e very much alike in appearance. From the&s;e are bending
cylindrical ducts, that run to the lungs, and are &s;uppo&s;ed to convey the
air, that gives the organs their proper play. The heart, however, has but one
valve; &s;o that their blood wants that double circulation which ob|tains in
the cetaceous kinds; and the lungs &s;eem to me rather as an internal
a&s;&s;i&s;tant to the gills, than fitted for &s;upplying the &s;ame offices as
in quadrupedes, for they want the pulmonary vein and artery.</P>
<P>From this &s;tructure, however, the animal is enabled to live
a longer time out of water than tho&s;e who&s;e gills are more &s;imple. The
carti|laginous &s;hark, or ray, live &s;ome hours after they are taken; while
the &s;pinous herring or mackarel expire a few minutes after they are brought
on &s;hore. From hence this tribe &s;eems po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of powers that
other fi&s;hes are wholly deprived of; they can remain continually under water,
without ever taking breath; while they can venture their heads above the deep,
and continue for hours out of their native element.</P>
<P>We ob&s;erved, in a former chapter, that &s;pi|nous fi&s;hes
have not, or at lea&s;t appear not to <PB N="234" REF="239"> have, externally
any in&s;truments of generation. It is very different with tho&s;e of the
carti|laginous kind, for the male always has the&s;e in&s;truments double. The
fi&s;h of this tribe are not unfrequently &s;een to copulate; and their manner
is belly to belly, &s;uch as may naturally be expected from animals who&s;e
parts of ge|neration are placed forward. They in general chu&s;e colder
&s;ea&s;ons and &s;ituations than other fi&s;h for propagating their kind; and
many of them bring forth in the mid&s;t of winter.</P>
<P>The &s;ame duplicity of character which marks their general
conformation obtains al&s;o with re|gard to their manner of bringing forth.
Some bring forth their young alive; and &s;ome bring forth eggs, which are
afterwards brought to maturity. In all, however, the manner of ge&s;tation is
nearly the &s;ame; for upon di&s;&s;ection, it is ever found, that the young,
while in the body, continue in the egg till a very little time before they are
excluded; the&s;e eggs they may properly be &s;aid to hatch within their body;
and as &s;oon as their young quit the &s;hell, they begin to quit the womb
al&s;o. Unlike to quadru|pedes, or the cetaceous tribes, that quit the egg
&s;tate a few days after their fir&s;t conception, and continue in the womb
&s;everal months after, the&s;e continue in the body of the female, in their
egg <PB N="235" REF="240"> &s;tate, for weeks together; and the eggs are found
linked together by a membrane, from which, when the faetus gets free, it
continues but a very &s;hort time till it delivers it&s;elf from its
confinement in the womb. The eggs them&s;elves con&s;i&s;t of a white and a
yolk, and have a &s;ub&s;tance, in&s;tead of &s;hell, that aptly may be
compared to &s;oftened horn. The&s;e, as I ob&s;erved, are &s;ometimes hatched
in the womb, as in the &s;hark and ray kinds; and they are &s;ometimes
excluded, as in the &s;turgeon, before the animal comes to its time of
di&s;en|gaging. Thus we &s;ee that there &s;eems very little difference between
the viviparous and the oviparous kinds, in this cla&s;s of fi&s;hes; the one
hatch their eggs in the womb, and the young continue no long time there; the
others exclude their eggs before hatching, and leave it to time and accident to
bring their young to maturity.</P>
<P>Such are the peculiar marks of the carti|laginous cla&s;s of
fi&s;hes, of which there are many kinds. To give a di&s;tinct de&s;cription of
every fi&s;h is as little my intention, as perhaps it is the wi&s;h of the
reader; but the peculiarities of each kind de&s;erve notice, and the mo&s;t
&s;triking of the&s;e it would be unpardonable to omit.</P>
<P>Cartilaginous fi&s;h may be divided fir&s;t into 
<PB N="236" REF="241"> tho&s;e of the &s;hark kind, with a body growing le&s;s
towards the tail, a rough &s;kin, with the mouth placed far beneath the end of
the no&s;e, five apertures on the &s;ides of the neck for breathing, and the
upper part of the tail longer than the lower. This cla&s;s chiefly comprehends
the Great White Shark, the Balance Fi&s;h, the Hound Fi&s;h, the Monk Fi&s;h,
the Dog Fi&s;h, the Ba&s;king Shark, the Zygaena, the Tope, the Cat Fi&s;h, the
Blue Shark, the Sea Fox, the Smooth Hound Fi&s;h, and the Porbeagle. The&s;e
are all of the &s;ame nature, and differ more in &s;ize, than in figure or
conformation.</P>
<P>The next divi&s;ion is that of flat fi&s;h; and the&s;e their
broad, flat, thin &s;hape is &s;ufficiently capable of di&s;tingui&s;hing from
all others of this kind. They may be ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed al&s;o from
&s;pinous flat fi&s;h, by the holes through which they breathe, which are
uncovered by a bone; and which, in this kind, are five on each &s;ide. In this
tribe we may place the Torpedo, the Skate, the Sharp-no&s;ed Ray, the Rough
Ray, the Thornback, and the Fire Flare.</P>
<P>The third divi&s;ion is that of the &s;lender &s;nake-&s;haped
kind: &s;uch as the Lamprey, the Pride, and the Pipe Fi&s;h.</P>
<P>The fourth divi&s;ion is of the Sturgeon and its variety, the
I&s;ing-gla&s;s Fi&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="242">The la&s;t divi&s;ion may comprize
fi&s;h of dif|ferent figures and natures, that do not rank under the former
divi&s;ions. The&s;e are the Sun Fi&s;h, the Tetrodon, the Lump Fi&s;h the Sea
Snail, the Chimaera and the Fi&s;hing Frog. Each of the&s;e has &s;omewhat
peculiar in its powers or its form, that de&s;erves to be re|marked. The
de&s;cription of the figures of the&s;e at lea&s;t may compen&s;ate for our

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of Cartilaginous Fi&s;hes of the Shark
Kind.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the inhabitants of the deep, tho&s;e of the &s;hark
kind are the fierce&s;t and the mo&s;t voracious. The &s;malle&s;t of this
tribe is not le&s;s dreaded by greater fi&s;h, than many that to ap|pearance
&s;eem more powerful; nor do any of them &s;eem fearful of attacking animals
far above their &s;ize: but the Great White Shark, which is the large&s;t of
the kind, joins to the mo&s;t amazing rapidity, the &s;tronge&s;t appetites for
mi&s;chief: as he approaches nearly in &s;ize to the whale, he far
&s;urpa&s;&s;es him in &s;trength and celerity, in the formidable arrangement
of his teeth, and his in&s;atiable de&s;ire of plunder.</P>
<P>The white &s;hark is &s;ometimes &s;een to rank even among
whales for magnitude; and is found from twenty to thirty feet long. Some
a&s;&s;ert that they have &s;een them of four thou&s;and pound weight; and we
are told particularly of one, that had a human corp&s;e in his belly. The head
is large, and &s;omewhat flatted; the &s;nout long, and the eyes large. The
mouth is enormou&s;ly wide; as is the throat, and capable of &s;wallowing a man
with great ea&s;e. But its <PB N="239" REF="244"> furniture of teeth is &s;till
more terrible: of the&s;e there are &s;ix rows, extremely hard,
&s;harp-pointed, and of a wedge-like figure. It is a&s;|&s;erted that there are
&s;eventy-two in each jaw, which make one hundred and forty-four in the whole;
yet others think that their number is uncertain; and that, in proportion as the
ani|mal grows older, the&s;e terrible in&s;truments of de&s;truction are found
to encrea&s;e. With the&s;e the jaws both above and below appear planted all
over; but the animal has a power of erecting or depre&s;&s;ing them at
plea&s;ure. When the &s;hark is at re&s;t, they lie quite flat in his mouth;
but when he prepares to &s;eize his prey, he erects all this dreadful
apparatus, by the help of a &s;et of mu&s;cles that join them to the jaw; and
the animal he &s;eizes, dies pierced with an hundred wounds in a moment.</P>
<P>Nor is this fi&s;h le&s;s terrible to behold as to the re&s;t
of his form: his fins are larger, in proportion; he is furni&s;hed with great
goggle eyes, that he turns with ea&s;e on every &s;ide, &s;o as to &s;ee his
prey behind him as well as before; and his whole a&s;pect is marked with a
character of malignity: his &s;kin al&s;o is rough, hard and prickly; being
that &s;ub|&s;tance which covers in&s;trument ca&s;es, called &s;hagreen.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="245">As the &s;hark is thus formidable in his
ap|pearance, &s;o is he al&s;o dreadful, from his cou|rage and activity. No
fi&s;h can &s;wim &s;o fa&s;t as he; none &s;o con&s;tantly employed in
&s;wimming, he out&s;trips the &s;wifte&s;t &s;hips, plays round them, darts
out before them, returns, &s;eems to gaze at the pa&s;&s;engers, and all the
while does not &s;eem to exhibit the &s;malle&s;t &s;ymptom of an effort to
proceed. Such amazing powers, with &s;uch great appetites for de&s;truction,
would quickly unpeople even the ocean, but pro|videntially the &s;hark's upper
jaw projects &s;o far above the lower, that he is obliged to turn on one &s;ide
(not on his back, as is generally &s;uppo&s;ed) to &s;eize his prey. As this
takes &s;ome &s;mall time to perform, the animal pur&s;ued &s;eizes that
opportunity to make its e&s;cape.</P>
<P>Still, however, the depredations he commits are frequent and
formidable. The &s;hark is the dread of &s;ailors in all hot climates; where,
like a greedy robber, he attends the &s;hips, in ex|pectation of what may drop
over board. A man who unfortunately falls into the &s;ea at &s;uch a time, is
&s;ure to peri&s;h, without mercy. A &s;ailor that was bathing in the
Mediterranean, near Antibes, in the year 1744, while he was &s;wimming about
fifty yards from the &s;hip, <PB N="241" REF="246"> perceived a mon&s;trous
fi&s;h making towards him, and &s;urveying him on every &s;ide, as fi&s;h are
often &s;een to look round a bait. The poor man, &s;truck with terror at its
approach, cried out to his companions in the ve&s;&s;el to take him on board.
They accordingly threw him a rope with the utmo&s;t expedition, and were
drawing him up by the &s;hip's &s;ide, when the &s;hark darted after him from
the deep, and &s;napped off his leg.</P>
<P>Mr. Penant tells us, that the ma&s;ter of a Guinea-&s;hip,
finding a rage for &s;uicide prevail among his &s;laves, from a notion the
unhappy creatures had, that after death they &s;hould be re&s;tored again to
their families, friends and country; to convince them at lea&s;t that &s;ome
di&s;grace &s;hould attend them here, he ordered one of their dead bodies to be
tied by the heels to a rope, and &s;o let down into the &s;ea; and though it
was drawn up again with great &s;wift|ne&s;s, yet, in that &s;hort &s;pace, the
&s;harks had bit off all but the feet. Whether this &s;tory is prior to an
accident of the &s;ame kind, which happened at Belfa&s;t, in Ireland, about
twenty years ago, I will not take upon me to determine; but certain it is,
there are &s;ome circum&s;tances alike in both, though more terrible in that I
am going to relate. A Guinea captain was, <PB N="242" REF="247"> by &s;tre&s;s
of weather, driven into the harbour of Belfa&s;t, with a lading of very
&s;ickly &s;laves, who, in the manner above-mentioned, took every opportunity
to throw them&s;elves over board when brought up upon deck, as is u&s;ual, for
the benefit of the fre&s;h air. The captain per|ceiving, among others, a woman
&s;lave attempt|ing to drown her&s;elf, pitched upon her as a proper example to
the re&s;t: as he &s;uppo&s;ed that they did not know the terrors attending
death, he ordered the woman to be tied with a rope under the arm-pits, and &s;o
let her down into the water. When the poor creature was thus plunged in, and
about half way down, &s;he was heard to give a terrible &s;hriek, which at
fir&s;t was a&s;cribed to her fears of drowning; but &s;oon after the water
appearing red all round her, &s;he was drawn up, and it was found that a
&s;hark, which had followed the &s;hip, had bit her off from the middle.</P>
<P>Such is the frightful rapacity of this animal; nothing that
has life is rejected. But it &s;eems to have a peculiar enmity to man: when
once it has ta&s;ted human fle&s;h, it never de&s;i&s;ts from haunting tho&s;e
places where it expects the re|turn of its prey. It is even a&s;&s;erted, that
along the coa&s;ts of Africa, where the&s;e animals are found in great
abundance, numbers of the <PB N="243" REF="248"> Negroes, who are obliged to
frequent the waters, are &s;eized and devoured by them every year. The people
of the&s;e coa&s;ts are firmly of opinion, that the &s;hark loves the black
man's fle&s;h in preference to the white; and that when men of different
colours are in the water together, it always makes choice of the former.</P>
<P>However this be, men of all colours are equally afraid of this
animal, and have con|trived different methods to de&s;troy him. In general,
they derive their &s;ucce&s;s from the &s;hark's own rapacity. The u&s;ual
method of our &s;ailors to take him, is by baiting a great hook with a piece of
beef or pork, which is thrown out into the &s;ea by a &s;trong cord,
&s;trengthened near the hook with an iron chain. Without this precaution, the
&s;hark would quickly bite the cord in two, and thus &s;et him|&s;elf free. It
is no unplea&s;ant amu&s;ement to ob&s;erve this voracious animal coming up to
&s;urvey the bait, particularly when not pre&s;&s;ed by hunger. He approaches
it, examines it, &s;wims round it, &s;eems for a while to neglect it, perhaps
apprehen&s;ive of the cord and the chain: he quits it for a little; but his
appetite pre&s;&s;ing, he returns again; appears preparing to devour it, but
quits it once more. When the &s;ailors have &s;ufficiently diverted
them&s;elves with his <PB N="244" REF="249"> different evolutions, they then
make a pretence, by drawing the rope, as if intending to take the bait away; it
is then that the glutton's hunger excites him; he darts at the bait, and
&s;wallows it, hook and all. Sometimes, how|ever, he does not &s;o entirely
gorge the whole, but that he once more gets free; yet even then, though wounded
and bleeding with the hook, he will again pur&s;ue the bait until he is taken.
When he finds the hook lodged in his maw, his utmo&s;t efforts are then
excited, but in vain, to get free; he tries with his teeth to cut the chain; he
pulls with all his force to break the line; he almo&s;t &s;eems to turn his
&s;tomach in&s;ide out, to di&s;gorge the hook: in this manner he continues his
formidable though fruitle&s;s efforts; till quite &s;pent, he &s;uffers his
head to be drawn above water, and the &s;ailors, confining his tail by a nooze,
in this manner draw him on &s;hip board, and di&s;patch him. This is done by
beating him on the head till he dies; yet even that is not ef|fected without
difficulty and danger; the enor|mous creature, terrible even in the agonies of
death, &s;till &s;truggles with his de&s;troyers; nor is there an animal in the
world that is harder to be killed. Even when cut in pieces, the mu&s;cles
&s;till pre&s;erve their motion, and vibrate for &s;ome minutes after being
&s;eparated from the body. <PB N="245" REF="250"> Another method of taking him,
is by &s;triking a barbed in&s;trument, called a fizgig, into his body, as he
bru&s;hes along by the &s;ide of the &s;hip. As &s;oon as he is taken up, to
prevent his flouncing, they cut off the tail with an ax, with the utmo&s;t
expedition.</P>
<P>This is the manner in which Europeans de|&s;troy the &s;hark;
but &s;ome of the Negroes along the African coa&s;t, take a bolder and more
dan|gerous method to combat their terrible enemy. Armed with nothing more than
a knife, the Negroe plunges into the water, where he &s;ees the &s;hark
watching for his prey, and boldly &s;wims forward to meet him; though the great
animal does not come to provoke the combat, he does not avoid it, and &s;uffers
the man to ap|proach him; but ju&s;t as he turns upon his &s;ide to &s;eize the
aggre&s;&s;or, the Negroe watches the opportunity, plunges his knife in the
fi&s;h's belly, and pur&s;ues his blows with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s that he lays
the ravenous tyrant dead at the bottom: he &s;oon however returns, fixes the
fi&s;h's head in a nooze, and drags him to &s;hore, where he makes a noble
fea&s;t for the adjacent villages.</P>
<P>Nor is man alone the only enemy this fi&s;h has to fear: the
Remora, or Sucking Fi&s;h, is probably a &s;till greater, and follows the
&s;hark <PB N="246" REF="251"> every where. This fi&s;h has got a power of
ad|hering to whatever it &s;ticks again&s;t, in the &s;ame manner as a
cupping-gla&s;s &s;ticks to the human body. It is by &s;uch an apparatus that
this ani|mal &s;ticks to the &s;hark, and drains away its moi&s;ture. The
&s;eamen, however, are of opi|nion, that it is &s;een to attend on the &s;hark
for more friendly purpo&s;es, to point him to his prey, and to apprize him of
his danger. For this rea&s;on it has been called the Shark's Pilot.</P>
<P>The &s;hark &s;o much re&s;embles the whale in &s;ize, that
&s;ome have injudiciou&s;ly ranked it in the cla&s;s of cetaceous fi&s;hes: but
its real rank is in the place here a&s;&s;igned it, among tho&s;e of the
cartilaginous kind. It breathes with gills and lungs, its bones are gri&s;tly,
and it brings forth &s;everal living young; Belonius a&s;&s;ures us, that he
&s;aw a female &s;hark produce eleven live young ones at a time. But I will not
take upon me to vouch for the veracity of Rondeletius, who, when talking of the
blue &s;hark, &s;ays, that the female will permit her &s;mall brood, when in
danger, to &s;wim down her mouth, and take &s;helter in her belly. Mr. Penant
indeed, &s;eems to give credit to the &s;tory, and thinks that this fi&s;h,
like the Oppo&s;&s;um, may have a place fitted by Nature for the reception of
her young. To his opinion much deference is due, and is &s;uf|ficient, 
<PB N="247" REF="252"> at lea&s;t, to make us &s;u&s;pend our a&s;&s;ent; for
nothing is &s;o contemptible as that affectation of wi&s;dom which &s;ome
di&s;play, by univer&s;al incredulity.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, a &s;hark, when living, is a very formidable
animal; and, when dead, is of very little value. The fle&s;h is hardly
di|ge&s;tible by any but the Negroes, who are fond of it to di&s;traction; the
liver affords three or four quarts of oil; &s;ome imaginary virtues have been
a&s;cribed to the brain; and its &s;kin is, by great labour, poli&s;hed into
that &s;ub&s;tance called &s;hagreen. Mr. Penant is of opinion, that the female
is larger than the male in all this tribe; which would, if confirmed by
expe|rience, make a &s;triking agreement between them and birds of prey. It
were to be wi&s;hed that &s;ucceeding hi&s;torians would examine into this
ob&s;ervation, which is offered only as a con|jecture!</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of Cartilaginous Flat-Fi&s;h, or the Ray

<P>THE &s;ame rapacity which impels the &s;hark along the
&s;urface of the water, actuates the flat fi&s;h at the bottom. Le&s;s active
and le&s;s for|midable, they creep in &s;ecurity along the bot|tom, &s;eize
every thing that comes in their way; neither the harde&s;t &s;hells nor the

&s;tomach is &s;o great, that it ea&s;ily dige&s;ts them.</P>
<P>The whole of this kind re&s;emble each other very &s;trongly

tail. They all have their eyes and mouth placed quite under the body, with
apertures for breathing either about or near them. They all have teeth, or a
rough bone, which an&s;wers the &s;ame purpo&s;e. Their bowels are very wide
towards the mouth, and go on dimini&s;hing to the tail. The tail is very
differently &s;haped from that of other fi&s;hes; and at fir&s;t &s;ight more
re&s;embling that of a quadrupede, being narrow, and ending either in a bunch
or a point. But what they are chiefly di&s;tingui&s;hed by is their &s;pines or
prickles, which the different &s;pecies have on different parts of their body.
Some are armed with &s;pines both above and below; others have them on the
upper part only; &s;ome have their &s;pines at the tail; &s;ome have three rows
of them, and others but one. The&s;e prickles in &s;ome are comparatively
&s;oft and feeble; tho&s;e of others, &s;trong and piercing. The &s;malle&s;t
of the&s;e &s;pines are u&s;ually in|clining towards the tail; the larger
towards the head.</P>
<P>It is by the &s;pines that the&s;e animals are
di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other. The &s;kate has the middle of the back
rough, and a &s;ingle row of &s;pines on the tail. The &s;harp no&s;ed ray has
ten &s;pines that are &s;ituated to|wards the middle of the back. The rough ray
<PB N="250" REF="258"> has its &s;pines &s;pread indi&s;criminately over the
the whole back. The thorn-back has its &s;pines di&s;po&s;ed in three rows upon
the back. The fire flare has but one &s;pine, but that indeed a terrible one.
This dangerous weapon is placed on the tail, about four iches from the body,
and is not le&s;s than five inches long. It is of a flinty hardne&s;s, the
&s;ides thin, &s;harp pointed, and clo&s;ely and &s;harply bearded the whole
way. The la&s;t of this tribe that I &s;hall mention is the torpedo; and this
animal has no &s;pines that can wound; but in the place of them it is
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of one of the mo&s;t potent and extraordinary fa|culties in
nature.</P>
<P>Such are the principal differences that may enable us to
di&s;tingui&s;h animals, &s;ome of which are of very great u&s;e to mankind,
from others that are terrible and noxious. With re&s;pect to their u&s;es
indeed, as we &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee, they differ much; but the &s;imilitude
among them, as to their nature, appetites, and conformation, is perfect and
entire. They are all as voracious as they are plenty; and as dangerous to a
&s;tranger as u&s;eful to him who can di&s;tingui&s;h their differences.</P>
<P>Of all the larger fi&s;h of the &s;ea, the&s;e are the mo&s;t
numerous; and they owe their numbers to their &s;ize. Except the white &s;hark
and cacha|lot alone, there is no other fi&s;h that has a &s;wallow 
<PB N="251" REF="259"> large enough to take them in; and their &s;pines make
them a &s;till more dangerous mor&s;el. Yet the &s;ize of &s;ome is &s;uch,
that even the &s;hark him&s;elf is unable to devour them: we have &s;een &s;ome
of them in England weigh above two hundred pounds; but that is nothing to their
enormous bulk in other parts of the world. Labat tells us of a prodigious ray
that was &s;peared by the Negroes at Guadaloupe, which was thirteen feet eight
inches broad, and above ten feet from the &s;nout to the in&s;ertion of the
tail. The tail it&s;elf was in proportion, for it was no le&s;s than fifteen
feet long; twenty inches broad at its in&s;ertion, and tapering to a point. The
body was two feet in depth; the &s;kin as thick as leather, and marked with
&s;pots; which &s;pots, in all of this kind, are only glands, that &s;upply a
mucous to lubricate and &s;often the &s;kin. This enormous fi&s;h was utterly
unfit to be eaten by the Europeans; but the Negroes cho&s;e out &s;ome of the
nice&s;t bits, and carefully &s;alted them up as a mo&s;t favou|rite
provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>Yet, large as this may &s;eem, it is very pro|bable that we
have &s;een only the &s;malle&s;t of the kind; as they generally keep at the
bottom, the large&s;t of the kind are &s;eldom &s;een; and, as they may
probably have been growing for ages, the extent of their magnitude is un|known.
<PB N="252" REF="260"> It is generally &s;uppo&s;ed, however, that they are the
large&s;t inhabitants of the deep; and, were we to credit the Norway Bi&s;hop,
there are &s;ome above a mile over. But to &s;uppo&s;e an animal of &s;uch
magnitude is ab|&s;urd; yet the over-&s;tretching the &s;uppo&s;ition does not
de&s;troy the probability that animals of this tribe grow to an enormous
&s;ize.</P>
<P>The ray generally chu&s;es for its retreat &s;uch parts of the
&s;ea as have a black muddy bottom; the large ones keep at greater depths; but
the &s;maller approach the &s;hores, and feed upon whatever living animals they
can &s;urprize, or whatever putrid &s;ub&s;tances they meet with. As they are
ravenous, they ea&s;ily take the bait, yet will not touch it if it be taken up
and kept a day or two out of water. Almo&s;t all fi&s;h ap|pear much more
delicate with regard to a baited hook than their ordinary food. They appear by
their manner to perceive the line and to dread it; but the impul&s;e of their
hunger is too great for their caution; and, even though they perceive the
danger, if thoroughly hungry, they devour the de&s;truction.</P>
<P>The&s;e fi&s;h generate in March and April; at which time only
they are &s;een &s;wimming near the &s;urface of the water, &s;everal of the
males pur&s;uing one female. They adhere &s;o fa&s;t to|gether 
<PB N="253" REF="261"> in coition, that the fi&s;hermen frequently draw up both
together, though only one has been hooked. The females are prolific to an
extreme degree; there having been no le&s;s than three hundred eggs taken out
of the body of a &s;ingle ray. The&s;e eggs are covered with a tough horny
&s;ub&s;tance, which they acquire in the womb; for before they de&s;cend into
that, they are attached to the ovary pretty much in the &s;ame manner as in the
body of a pullet. From this ovary, or egg-bag, as it is vulgarly called, the
fi&s;h's eggs drop one by one into the womb, and there receive a &s;hell by the
concretion of the fluids of that organ. When come to the proper maturity, they
are excluded, but never above one or two at a time, and often at in|tervals of
three or four hours. The&s;e eggs, or pur&s;es, as the fi&s;hermen call them,
are u&s;ually ca&s;t about the beginning of May, and they continue ca&s;ting
during the whole &s;ummer. In October, when their breeding cea&s;es, they are
exceedingly poor and thin; but in November they begin to improve, and grow
gradually better till May, when they are in the highe&s;t perfection.</P>
<P>It is chiefly during the winter &s;ea&s;on that our
fi&s;hermen take them; but the Dutch, who are indefatigable, begin their
operations earlier, <PB N="254" REF="262"> and fi&s;h with better &s;ucce&s;s
than we. The method practi&s;ed by the fi&s;hermen of Scarbo|rough is thought
to be the be&s;t among the En|gli&s;h; and, as Mr. Penant has given a very
&s;uc|cinct account of it, I will take leave to pre&s;ent it to the reader.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline"> "When they go out to fi&s;h, each per&s;on is
provided with three lines: each man's lines are fairly coiled upon a flat
oblong piece of wicker work; the hooks being baited and placed very regularly
in the centre of the coil. Each line is furni&s;hed with two hundred and eighty
hooks, at the di&s;tance of &s;ix feet two inches from each other. The hooks
are fa&s;tened to lines of twi&s;ted hor&s;e-hair, twenty-&s;even inches in
length. 
<P> "When fi&s;hing, there are always three men in each coble;
and con&s;equently nine of the&s;e lines are fa&s;tened together and u&s;ed as
one line, extending in length near three miles, and furni&s;hed with above two
thou&s;and five hundred hooks. An anchor and a buoy are fixed at the fir&s;t
end of the line, and one more at each end of each man's lines: in all, four
anchors, and four buoys made of leather or cork. The line is always laid
acro&s;s the current. The tides of flood and ebb continue an equal time upon
our coa&s;t; and, when <PB N="255" REF="263"> undi&s;turbed by winds, run each
way about &s;ix hours. They are &s;o rapid that the fi&s;her|men can only
&s;hoot and haul their lines at the turn of the tide; and therefore the lines
al|ways remain upon the ground about &s;ix hours. The &s;ame rapidity of tide
prevents their u&s;ing hand lines; and therefore two of the people commonly
wrap them&s;elves in the &s;ail and &s;leep, while the other keeps a &s;trict
look-out, for fear of being run down by &s;hips, and to ob&s;erve the weather:
for &s;torms often ri&s;e &s;o &s;uddenly, that it is &s;ometimes with extreme
difficulty they e&s;cape to the &s;hore, though they leave lines behind
them.</P> 
<P> "The coble is twenty feet &s;ix inches long, and five feet
extreme breadth. It is about one ton burthen, rowed with three pair of oars,
and admirably con&s;tructed for the pur|po&s;e of encountering a mountainous
&s;ea. They hoi&s;t &s;ail when the wind &s;uits.</P> 
<P> "The five-men-boat is forty feet long, fifteen broad, and
twenty-five tons burthen. It is &s;o called, though navigated by &s;ix men and
a boy; becau&s;e one of the men is hired to cook, and does not &s;hare in the
profits with the other five. All our able fi&s;hermen go in the&s;e boats to
the herring-fi&s;hery at Yar|mouth, the latter end of September, and 
<PB N="256" REF="264"> return about the middle of November. The boats are then
laid up until the beginning of Lent, at which time they go off in them to the
edge of the Dogger, and other places, to fi&s;h for turbot, cod, ling,
&s;kates, &amp;c. They always take two cobles on board, and when they come upon
their ground, anchor the boat, throw out the cobles, and fi&s;h in the &s;ame
manner as tho&s;e do who go from the &s;hore in a coble; with this difference
only, that here each man is provided with double the quantity of lines, and,
in&s;tead of waiting the return of the tide in the coble, return to the boat
and bait their other lines; thus hawling one &s;et, and &s;hooting another,
every turn of tide. They commonly run into the harbour twice a week, to deliver
their fi&s;h. The five-men-boat is decked at each end, but open in the middle,
and has two long &s;ails.</P> 
<P> "The be&s;t bait for all kinds of fi&s;h, is fre&s;h herring
cut in pieces of a proper &s;ize; and, notwith&s;tanding what has been &s;aid
to the contrary, they are taken there at any time in the winter, and all the
&s;pring, whenever the fi&s;hermen put down their nets for that pur|po&s;e: the
five-men boats always take &s;ome nets for that end. Next to herrings are the 
<PB N="257" REF="265"> le&s;&s;er lampreys, which come all winter by
land-carriage from Tadca&s;ter. The next baits in e&s;teem are &s;mall haddocks
cut in pieces, &s;and worms, mu&s;cles and limpets; and la&s;tly, when none of
the&s;e can be found, they u&s;e bullock's liver. The hooks u&s;ed there are
much &s;maller than tho&s;e employed at Iceland and Newfoundland. Experience
has &s;hewn that the larger fi&s;h will take a living &s;mall one upon the
hook, &s;ooner than any bait that can be put on; therefore they u&s;e &s;uch as
the fi&s;h can &s;wallow. The hooks are two inches and an half long in the
&s;hank; and near an inch wide between the &s;hank and the point. The line is
made of &s;mall cording, and is always tanned before it is u&s;ed. All the rays
and turbots are extremely delicate in their choice of baits: if a piece of
herring or had|dock has been twelve hours out of the &s;ea, and then u&s;ed as
a bait, they will not touch it."</P></Q> </P>
<P>Such is the manner of fi&s;hing for tho&s;e fi&s;h that
u&s;ually keep near the bottom on the coa&s;ts of England; and Duhamel
ob&s;erves, that the be&s;t weather for &s;ucceeding, is a half calm, when the
waves are ju&s;t curled with a &s;ilent breeze.</P>
<P>But this extent of line, which runs, as we have &s;een, three
miles along the bottom, is <PB N="258" REF="266"> nothing to what the Italians
throw out in the Mediterranean. Their fi&s;hing is carried on in a tartan,
which is a ve&s;&s;el much larger than our's; and they bait a line of no le&s;s
than twenty miles long, with above ten or twelve thou&s;and hooks. This line is
called the pa|ra&s;ina; and the fi&s;hing goes by that of the pielago. This
line is not regularly drawn every &s;ix hours, as with us, but remains for
&s;ome time in the &s;ea; and it requires the &s;pace of twenty-four hours to
take it up in. By this apparatus they take rays, &s;harks, and other fi&s;h;
&s;ome of which are above a thou&s;and pound weight. When they have caught any
of this magnitude, they &s;trike them through with an harpoon to bring them on
board, and kill them as fa&s;t as they can.</P>
<P>This method of catching fi&s;h is obviou&s;ly fatiguing and
dangerous; but the value of the capture generally repays the pain. The &s;kate
and the thornback are very good food; and their &s;ize, which is from ten
pounds to two hundred weight, very well rewards the trouble of fi&s;hing for
them. But it &s;ometimes happens that the lines are vi&s;ited by very unwelcome
intruders; by the rough ray, the fireflare, or the torpedo. To all the&s;e the
fi&s;hermen have the mo&s;t mortal antipathy; and, when di&s;covered, 
<PB N="259" REF="267"> &s;hudder at the &s;ight: however, they are not always
&s;o much upon their guard, but that they &s;ometimes feel the different
re&s;entments of this angry tribe; and, in&s;tead of a prize, find they have
caught a vindictive enemy. When &s;uch is the ca&s;e, they take care to throw
them back into the &s;ea with the &s;wifte&s;t expedition.</P>
<P>The rough ray inflicts but &s;light wounds with the prickles
with which its whole body is fur|ni&s;hed. To the ignorant it &s;eems
harmle&s;s, and a man would at fir&s;t &s;ight venture to take it in his hand,
without any apprehen&s;ions; but he &s;oon finds, that there is not a &s;ingle
part of its body that is not armed with &s;pines; and that there is no way of
&s;eizing the animal, but by the little fin at the end of the tail.</P>
<P>But this animal is harmle&s;s, when compared to the Fireflare,
which &s;eems to be the dread of even the bolde&s;t and mo&s;t experienced
fi&s;her|men. The weapon with which Nature has armed this animal, which grows
from the tail, and which we de&s;cribed as barbed and five inches long, hath
been an in&s;trument of terror to the ancient fi&s;hermen as well as the
moderns: and they have delivered many tremendous fables of its a&s;toni&s;hing
effects. Pliny, Aelian, and Oppian, have &s;upplied it with a venom that
affects even the inanimate creation: trees that <PB N="260" REF="268"> are
&s;truck by it, in&s;tantly lo&s;e their verdure; and rocks them&s;elves are
incapable of re&s;i&s;ting the potent poi&s;on. The enchantre&s;s Circe armed
her &s;on with a &s;pear headed with the &s;pine of the trygon, as the mo&s;t
irre&s;i&s;tible weapon &s;he could furni&s;h him with; a weapon that &s;oon
after was to be the death of his own father.</P>
<P>That &s;pears and darts, &s;ays Mr. Penant, might in very
early times have been headed with this bone in&s;tead of iron, we have no
doubt. The Americans head their arrows with the bones of fi&s;hes to this day;
and from their hardne&s;s and &s;harpne&s;s, they are no contemp|tible weapons.
But that this &s;pine is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of tho&s;e venomous qualities
a&s;cribed to it, we have every rea&s;on to doubt; though &s;ome men of high
reputation, and the whole body of fi&s;hermen, contend for its venomous
effects. It is, in fact, a weapon of offence belonging to this animal, and
capable, from its barbs, of in|flicting a very terrible wound, attended with
dangerous &s;ymptoms; but it cannot be po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of any poi&s;on, as
the &s;pine has no &s;heath to pre&s;erve the &s;uppo&s;ed venom on its
&s;urface; and the animal has no gland that &s;eparates the noxious fluid:
be&s;ides, all tho&s;e animals that are furni&s;hed with envenomed fangs or
&s;tings, &s;eem to have them &s;trongly connected with their &s;afety and
exi&s;tence; they never part with them; there <PB N="261" REF="269"> is an
apparatus of poi&s;on prepared in the body to accompany their exertions; and
when the fangs or &s;tings are taken away, the animal langui&s;hes and dies.
But it is otherwi&s;e with the &s;pine of the fireflare; it is fixed to the
tail, as a quill is into the tail of a fowl, and is annually &s;hed in the
&s;ame manner: it may be nece&s;&s;ary for the creature's defence, but is no
way nece&s;&s;ary for its exi&s;tence. The wound inflicted by an ani|mal's
tail, has &s;omething terrible in the idea, and may from thence alone be
&s;uppo&s;ed to be fatal. From hence terror might have added poi&s;on to the
pain, and called up imagined dan|gers: the Negroes univer&s;ally believe that
the &s;ting is poi&s;onous; but they never die of the wound; for, by opening
the fi&s;h, and laying it to the part injured, it effects a &s;peedy cure. The
&s;lightne&s;s of the remedy proves the innocence of the wound.</P>
<P>The Torpedo is an animal of this kind, equally formidable and
well known with the former; but the manner of its operating, is to this hour a
my&s;tery to mankind. The body of this fi&s;h is almo&s;t circular, and thicker
than others of the ray kind; the &s;kin is &s;oft, &s;mooth, and of a
yellowi&s;h colour, marked, as all the kind, with large annular &s;pots; the
eyes very &s;mall; the tail tapering to a point; and the weight 
<PB N="262" REF="270"> of the fi&s;h from a quarter to fifteen pounds. Redi
found one twenty-four pounds weight. To all outward appearance, it is
furni&s;hed with no extraordinary powers; it has no mu&s;cles formed for
particularly great exertions; no in|ternal conformation perceptibly differing
from he re&s;t of its kind: yet &s;uch is that unac|countable power it
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, that, the in&s;tant it is touched, it numbs not only the
hand and arm, but &s;ometimes al&s;o the whole body. The &s;hock received, by
all accounts, mo&s;t re&s;embles the &s;troke of an electrical machine;
&s;udden, tingling, and painful. 
<Q REND="inline">"The in&s;tant," &s;ays Kempfer, "I touched it
with my hand, I felt a terrible numbne&s;s in my arm, and as far up as the
&s;houlder. Even if one treads upon it with the &s;hoe on, it affects not only
the leg, but the whole thigh upwards. Tho&s;e who touch it with the foot, are
&s;eized with a &s;tronger palpitation than even tho&s;e who touched it with
the hand. This numbne&s;s bears no re&s;emblance to that which we feel when a
nerve is a long time pre&s;&s;ed, and the foot is &s;aid to be a&s;leep; it
rather appears like a &s;udden vapour, which pa&s;&s;ing through the pores in
an in&s;tant, penetrates to the very &s;prings of life, from whence it
diffu&s;es it&s;elf over the whole body, and gives real pain. The nerves are
&s;o affected, that the per&s;on <PB N="263" REF="271"> &s;truck imagines all
the bones of his body, and particularly tho&s;e of the limb that re|ceived the
blow, are driven out of joint. All this is accompanied with an univer&s;al
tremor, a &s;ickne&s;s of the &s;tomach, a general convul|&s;ion, and a total
&s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the faculties of the mind. In &s;hort," continues Kempfer,
"&s;uch is the pain, that all the force of our promi&s;es and authority could
not prevail upon a &s;ea man to undergo the &s;hock a &s;econd time. A Negroe
indeed, that was &s;tanding by, rea|dily undertook to touch the torpedo; and
was &s;een to handle it without feeling any of its effects. He informed us,
that his whole &s;ecret con&s;i&s;ted in keeping in his breath; and we found,
upon trial, that this method an&s;wered with our&s;elves. When we held in our
breath, the torpedo was harmle&s;s; but when we breathed ever &s;o little, its
efficacy took place."</Q></P>
<P>Kempfer has very well de&s;cribed the effects of this animal's
&s;hock; but &s;ucceeding experience has abundantly convinced us, that holding
in the breath, no way guards again&s;t its violence. Tho&s;e, therefore, who,
depending on that re|ceipt, &s;hould play with a torpedo, would &s;oon find
them&s;elves painfully undeceived: not but that this fi&s;h may be many times
touched with per|fect <PB N="264" REF="272"> &s;ecurity; for it is not upon
every occa&s;ion that it exerts its potency. Reaumur, who made &s;everal trials
upon this animal, has at lea&s;t convinced the world that it is not
nece&s;|&s;arily, but by an effort, that the torpedo numbs the hand of him that
touches it. He tried &s;e|veral times, and could ea&s;ily tell when the fi&s;h
intended the &s;troke, and when it was about to continue harmle&s;s. Always
before the fi&s;h in|tended the &s;troke, it flattened the back, rai&s;ed the
head and the tail, and then, by a violent contraction in the oppo&s;ite
direction, &s;truck with its back again&s;t the pre&s;&s;ing finger, and the
body, which before was flat, became humped and round.</P>
<P>But we mu&s;t not infer, as he has done, that the whole effect
of this animal's exertions ari&s;e from the greatne&s;s of the blow which the
fingers receive at the in&s;tant they are &s;truck. We will, with him, allow,
that the &s;troke is very powerful, equal to that of a mu&s;quet-ball, &s;ince
he will have it &s;o; but it is very well known, that a blow, though never &s;o
great on the points of the fingers, diffu&s;es no numbne&s;s over the whole
body: &s;uch a blow might break the ends of the fingers indeed, but would
hardly numb the &s;houlder. Tho&s;e blows that numb, mu&s;t be applied
immediately to &s;ome <PB N="265" REF="273"> great and leading nerves, or to a
large &s;urface of the body; a powerful &s;troke applied to the points of the
fingers will be exce&s;&s;ively painful indeed, but the numbne&s;s will not
reach beyond the fingers them&s;elves. We mu&s;t, therefore, look for another
cau&s;e producing the powerful effects wrought by the torpedo.</P>
<P>Others have a&s;cribed it to a tremulous motion which this
animal is found to po&s;&s;e&s;s, &s;ome|what re&s;embling that of an hor&s;e's
&s;kin, when &s;tung by a fly. This operating under the touch with an amazing
quickne&s;s of vibration, they &s;uppo&s;e produces the unea&s;y &s;en&s;ation
de&s;cribed above; &s;omething &s;imilar to what we feel when we rub plu&s;h
cloth again&s;t the grain. But the cau&s;e is quite di&s;proportioned to the
effect; and &s;o much beyond our experience, that this &s;olution is as
difficult as the wonder we want to explain.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t probable &s;olution &s;eems to be, that the &s;hock
proceeds from an animal electricity, which this fi&s;h has &s;ome hidden power
of &s;toring up, and producing on its mo&s;t urgent occa&s;ions. The &s;hocks
are entirely &s;imilar; the duration of the pain is the &s;ame: but how the
animal con|trives to renew the charge, how it is prevented from evaporating it
on contiguous objects, how it is originally procured, the&s;e are difficulties
that time alone can elucidate.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="274">But to know even the effects is
wi&s;dom. Certain it is that the powers of this animal &s;eem to decline with
its vigour; for as its &s;trength cea&s;es, the force of the &s;hock &s;eems to
dimini&s;h; till, at la&s;t, when the fi&s;h is dead, the whole power is
de&s;troyed, and it may be handled or eaten with perfect &s;ecurity: on the
contrary, when immediately taken out of the &s;ea, its force is very great, and
not only affects the hand, but if even touched with a &s;tick, the per&s;on
finds him&s;elf &s;ometimes affected. This power, however, is not to be
extended to the degree that &s;ome would have us believe; as reaching the
fi&s;hermen at the end of the line, or numbing fi&s;hes in the &s;ame pond.
Godig|nus, in his Hi&s;tory of Aby&s;&s;inia, carries this quality to a mo&s;t
ridiculous exce&s;s: he tells us of one of the&s;e that was put into a ba&s;ket
among a number of dead fi&s;hes, and that the next morning the people, to their
utter a&s;toni&s;hment, perceived, that the torpedo had actually numbed the
dead fi&s;hes into life again.</P>
<P>To conclude, it is generally &s;uppo&s;ed that the female
torpedo is much more powerful than the male. Lorenzini, who has made &s;eve|ral
experiments upon this animal, &s;eems con|vinced that its power wholly
re&s;ides in two thin mu&s;cles that cover a part of the back. 
<PB N="267" REF="275"> The&s;e he calls the trembling fibres; and he
a&s;&s;erts that the animal may be touched with &s;afety in any other part. It
is now known al&s;o that there are more fi&s;h than this of the ray kind,
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the numbing quality, which has acquired them the name of
the torpedo. The&s;e are de&s;cribed by Atkins and Moore, and found in great
abundance along the coa&s;t of Africa. They are &s;haped like a mackarel,
except that the head is much larger; the effects of the&s;e &s;eem al&s;o to
differ in &s;ome re&s;pects. Moore talks of keeping his hand upon the animal;
which in the ray torpedo it is actually impo&s;&s;ible to do. 
<Q REND="inline">"There was no man in the company," &s;ays he,
"that could bear to keep his hand on this animal the twentieth part of a
minute, it gave him &s;o great pain; but upon taking the hand away, the
numbne&s;s went off, and all was well again. This numbing quality continued in
this torpedo even after it was dead; and the very &s;kin was &s;till
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of its extraordinary power till it became dry."</Q> Condamime
informs us of a fi&s;h po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the powers of the torpedo, of a
&s;hape very different from the former, and every way re&s;embling a lamprey.
This animal, if touched by the hand, or even with a &s;tick, in&s;tantly
benumbs the hand and arm to the very &s;houlder; and &s;ome|times 
<PB N="268" REF="276"> the man falls down under the blow. The&s;e animals,
therefore, mu&s;t affect the ner|vous &s;y&s;tem in a different manner from the
former, both with re&s;pect to the manner and the intention; but how this
effect is wrought, we mu&s;t be content to di&s;mi&s;s in ob&s;curity.</P>

<PB N="269" REF="277">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of the Lamprey and its Affinities.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is a &s;pecies of the Lamprey &s;erved up as a great
delicacy among the modern Romans, very different from ours. Whether theirs be
the murena of the ancients I will not pretend to &s;ay; but there is nothing
more cer|tain than that our lamprey is not. The Roman lamprey agrees with the
ancient fi&s;h in being kept in ponds, and con&s;idered by the luxurious as a
very great delicacy.</P>
<P>The lamprey known among us is differently e&s;timated,
according to the &s;ea&s;on in which it is caught, or the place where it has
been fed. Tho&s;e that leave the &s;ea to depo&s;it their &s;pawn in fre&s;h
waters are the be&s;t; tho&s;e that are entirely bred in our rivers, and that
have never been at &s;ea, are con&s;idered as much inferior to the former.
Tho&s;e that are taken in the months of March, April, or May, ju&s;t upon their
leav|ing the &s;ea, are reckoned very good; tho&s;e that are caught after they
have ca&s;t their &s;pawn, are found to be flabby and of little value. Tho&s;e
caught in &s;everal of the rivers in Ireland the people will not venture to
touch; tho&s;e <PB N="270" REF="278"> of the Engli&s;h Severn are con&s;idered
as the mo&s;t delicate of all other fi&s;h whatever.</P>
<P>The lamprey much re&s;embles an eel in its general appearance,
but is of a lighter colour, and rather a clum&s;ier make. It differs however in
the mouth, which is round, and placed rather obliquely below the end of the
no&s;e. It more re&s;embles the mouth of a leech than an eel; and the animal
has a hole on the top of the head through which it &s;pouts water, as in the
ceta|ceous kind. There are &s;even holes on each &s;ide for re&s;piration; and
the &s;ins are formed rather by a lengthening out of the &s;kin, than any &s;et
of bones or &s;pines for that purpo&s;e. As the mouth is formed re&s;embling
that of a leech, &s;o it has a property re&s;embling that animal of &s;ticking
clo&s;e to and &s;ucking any body it is applied to. It is extraordinary the
power they have of ad|hering to &s;tones; which they do &s;o firmly as not to
be drawn off without &s;ome difficulty. We are told of one that weighed but
three pound; and yet it &s;tuck &s;o firmly to a &s;tone of twelve pounds, that
it remained &s;u&s;pended at its mouth, from which it was &s;eparated with no
&s;mall difficulty. This amazing power of &s;uction is &s;uppo&s;ed to ari&s;e
from the animal's exhau&s;ting the air within its body by the hole over the
no&s;e, while the mouth is clo&s;ely fixed <PB N="271" REF="279"> to the
object, and permits no air to enter. It would be ea&s;y to determine the weight
this animal is thus able to &s;u&s;tain; which will be equal to the weight of a
column of air of equal diameter with the fi&s;h's mouth.</P>
<P>From &s;ome peculiarity of formation, this animal &s;wims
generally with its body as near as po&s;&s;ible to the &s;urface; and it might
ea&s;ily be drowned by being kept by force for any time under water. Muralto
has given us the ana|tomy of this animal; but, in a very minute de&s;cription,
makes no mention of lungs. Yet I am very apt to &s;u&s;pect, that two red
glands ti&s;&s;ued with nerves, which he de&s;cribes as lying towards the back
of the head, are no other than the lungs of this animal. The ab&s;olute
nece&s;&s;ity it is under of breathing in the air, convinces me that it mu&s;t
have lungs, though I do not know of any anatomi&s;t that has de|&s;cribed
them.</P>
<P>The adhe&s;ive quality in the lamprey may be in &s;ome
mea&s;ure encrea&s;ed by that &s;limy &s;ub|&s;tance with which its body is all
over &s;meared; a &s;ub&s;tance that &s;erves at once to keep it warm in its
cold element, and al&s;o to keep its &s;kin &s;oft and pliant. This mucous is
&s;eparated by two long lymphatic canals, that extend on each &s;ide from the
head to the tail, and that furni&s;h <PB N="272" REF="280"> it in great
abundance. As to its inte&s;tines, it &s;eems to have but one great bowel,
running from the mouth to the vent, narrow at both ends, and wide in the
middle.</P>
<P>So &s;imple a conformation &s;eems to imply an equal
&s;implicity of appetite. In fact, the lam|prey's food is either &s;lime and
water, or &s;uch &s;mall water-in&s;ects as are &s;carce perceivable. Perhaps
its appetite may be more active at &s;ea, of which it is properly a native; but
when it comes up into our rivers, it is hardly perceived to devour any
thing.</P>
<P>Its u&s;ual time of leaving the &s;ea, which it is annually
&s;een to do in order to &s;pawn, is about the beginning of &s;pring; and after
a &s;tay of a few months it returns again to the &s;ea. Their preparation for
&s;pawning is peculiar; their manner is to make holes in the gravelly bottom of
rivers; and on this occa&s;ion their &s;ucking power is particularly
&s;erviceable; for if they meet with a &s;tone of a con&s;iderable &s;ize, they
will remove it and throw it out. Their young are produced from eggs in the
manner of flat fi&s;h; the female remains near the place where they are
excluded, and continues with them till they come forth. She is &s;ometimes
&s;een with her whole family playing about her; and after &s;ome time &s;he
conducts them in triumph back to the ocean.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="281">But &s;ome have not &s;ufficient
&s;trength to re|turn; and the&s;e continue in the fre&s;h water till they die.
Indeed, the life of this fi&s;h, according to Rondeletius, who has given its
hi&s;tory, is but of very &s;hort continuance; and a &s;ingle brood is the
extent of the female's fertility. As &s;oon as &s;he has returned after
ca&s;ting her eggs, &s;he &s;eems exhau&s;ted and flabby. She becomes old
before her time; and two years is generally the limit of her exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>However this may be, they are very indif|ferent eating after
they have ca&s;t their eggs, and particularly at the approach of hot weather.
The be&s;t &s;ea&s;on for them is the months of March, April, and May; and they
are u&s;ually taken in nets with &s;almon, and &s;ometimes in ba&s;kets at the
bottom of the river. It has been an old cu&s;tom for the city of Glouce&s;ter,
an|nually to pre&s;ent the king with a lamprey-pye; and as the gift is made at
Chri&s;tma&s;s, it is not without great difficulty the corporation can procure
the proper quantity, though they give a guinea a piece for taking them.</P>
<P>How much they were valued among the an|cients, or a fi&s;h
bearing &s;ome re&s;emblance to them, appears from all the cla&s;&s;ics that
have prai&s;ed good living or ridiculed gluttony. One &s;tory we are told of
this fi&s;h with which I will <PB N="274" REF="282"> conclude its hi&s;tory. A
&s;enator of Rome, who&s;e name does not de&s;erve being tran&s;mitted to
po|&s;terity, was famous for the delicacy of his lam|preys. Tigelinus,
Manucius, and all the cele|brated epicures of Rome, were loud in his prai&s;es:
no man's fi&s;h had &s;uch a flavour, was &s;o nicely fed, or &s;o exactly
pickled. Augu&s;tus, hearing &s;o much of this man's entertainments, de&s;ired
to be his gue&s;t; and &s;oon found that fame had been ju&s;t to his merits;
the man had indeed very fine lampreys, and of an exqui&s;ite flavour. The
emperor was de&s;irous of knowing the method by which he fed his fi&s;h to &s;o
fine a reli&s;h; and the glutton, making no &s;ecret of his art, informed him
that his way was to throw into his ponds &s;uch of his &s;laves as had at any
time di&s;plea&s;ed him. Augu&s;tus, we are told, was not much plea&s;ed with
his receipt; and in|&s;tantly ordered all his ponds to be filled up. The
&s;tory would have ended better if he had ordered the owner to be flung in
al&s;o.</P>

<P><PB N="275" REF="284"> THE Sturgeon, with a form as terrible
and a body as large as the &s;hark, is yet as harmle&s;s as the fi&s;h we have
been ju&s;t de&s;cribing; in|capable and unwilling to injure others, it flies
from the &s;malle&s;t fi&s;hes, and generally falls a victim to its own
timidity.</P>
<P>The &s;turgeon in its general form re&s;embles a fre&s;h-water
pike. The no&s;e is long; the mouth is &s;ituated beneath, being &s;mall, and
without jaw-bones or teeth. But, though it is &s;o harm|le&s;s and ill provided
for war, the body is for|midable enough to appearance. It is long, pentagonal,
and covered with five rows of large bony knobs, one row on the back and two on
each &s;ide, and a number of fins to give it greater expedition. Of this fi&s;h
there are three kinds; the Common Sturgeon, the Caviar Sturgeon, and the Hu&s;o
or I&s;ingla&s;s fi&s;h. The fir&s;t has eleven knobs or &s;cales on the back;
the &s;econd has fifteen; and the latter thirteen on the back and forty-three
on the tail. The&s;e dif|ferences &s;eem &s;light to us who only con&s;ider the
animal's form; but tho&s;e who con&s;ider its u&s;es <PB N="276" REF="285">
find the di&s;tinction of con&s;iderable importance. The fir&s;t is the
&s;turgeon, the fle&s;h of which is &s;ent pickled into all parts of Europe.
The &s;econd is the fi&s;h from the roe of which that noted delicacy called
caviar is made; and the third, be&s;ides &s;upplying the caviar, furni&s;hes
al&s;o the valuable commodity of i&s;ingla&s;s. They all grow to a very great
&s;ize; and &s;ome of them have been found above eighteen feet long.</P>
<P>There is not a country in Europe but what this fi&s;h vi&s;its
at different &s;ea&s;ons; it annually a&s;cends the large&s;t rivers to
&s;pawn, and pro|pagates in an amazing number. The inhabitants along the banks
of the Po, the Danube, and the Walga, make great profit yearly of its
incur|&s;ions up the &s;tream, and have their nets pre|pared for its reception.
The &s;turgeon al&s;o is brought daily to the markets of Rome and Ve|nice, and
they are known to abound in the Me|diterranean &s;ea. Yet tho&s;e fi&s;h that
keep entirely either in &s;alt or fre&s;h water are but compara|tively &s;mall.
When the &s;turgeon enjoys the vici&s;&s;itude of fre&s;h and &s;alt water, it
is then that it grows to an enormous &s;ize, &s;o as almo&s;t to rival even the
whale in magnitude.</P>
<P>Nor are we without frequent vi&s;its from this much e&s;teemed
fi&s;h in England. It is often ac|cidentally taken in our rivers in
&s;almon-nets, <PB N="267" REF="286"> particularly in tho&s;e parts that are
not far re|mote from the &s;ea. The large&s;t we have heard of caught in
Great-Britain was a fi&s;h taken in the E&s;ke, where they are mo&s;t
frequently found, which weighed four hundred and &s;ixty pounds. An enormous
&s;ize to tho&s;e who have only &s;een our fre&s;h-water fi&s;hes!</P>
<P>North-America al&s;o furni&s;hes the &s;turgeon; their rivers
in May, June, and July, &s;upply them in very great abundance. At that time
they are &s;een &s;porting in the water, and leap|ing from its &s;urface
&s;everal yards into the air. When they fall again on their &s;ides, the
concu&s;&s;ion is &s;o violent, that the noi&s;e is heard in &s;till weather at
&s;ome miles di&s;tance.</P>
<P>But of all places where this animal is to be found, it appears
no where in &s;uch numbers as in the Lakes of Fri&s;chehaff and Curi&s;chaff,
near the city of Pillau. In the rivers al&s;o that empty them&s;elves into the
Euxine Sea this fi&s;h is caught in great numbers, particularly at the mouth of
the river Don. In all the&s;e places the fi&s;hermen regularly expect their
arrival from the &s;ea, and have their nets and &s;alt ready prepared for their
reception.</P>
<P>As the &s;turgeon is an harmle&s;s fi&s;h and no way
voracious, it is never caught by a bait in the ordinary manner of fi&s;hing,
but always in <PB N="278" REF="287"> nets. From the de&s;cription given above
of its mouth, it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that the &s;tur|geon would &s;wallow
any hook capable of holding &s;o large a bulk and &s;o &s;trong a &s;wimmer. In
fact, it never attempts to &s;eize any of the finny tribe, but lives by rooting
at the bottom of the &s;ea, where it makes in&s;ects and &s;ea-plants its whole
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence. From this quality of floun|dering at the bottom it has
received its name; which comes from the German verb <HI>&s;toeren,</HI>
&s;ig|nifying to wallow in the mud. That it lives upon no large animals is
obvious to all tho&s;e who cut it open, where nothing is found in its &s;tomach
but a kind of &s;limy &s;ub&s;tance, which has induced &s;ome to think it lives
only upon water and air. From hence there is a German proverb, which is applied
to a man extremely temperate, when they &s;ay he is as moderate as a
&s;turgeon.</P>
<P>As the &s;turgeon is &s;o temperate in its appe|tites, &s;o is
it al&s;o equally timid in its nature. There would be &s;carce any method of
taking it did not its natural de&s;ire of propagation induce it to incur &s;o
great a variety of dangers. The &s;malle&s;t fi&s;h is alone &s;ufficient to
terrify a &s;hoal of &s;turgeons; for, being unfurni&s;hed with any weapon of
de|fence, they are obliged to tru&s;t to their &s;wiftne&s;s and their caution
for &s;ecurity. Like all animals <PB N="279" REF="288"> that do not make war
upon others, &s;turgeons live in &s;ociety among them&s;elves; rather for the
purpo&s;es of plea&s;ure, than from any power of mutual protection. Ge&s;ner
even a&s;&s;erts, that they are delighted with &s;ounds of various kinds; and
that he has &s;een them &s;hoal together, at the notes of a trumpet.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual time, as was &s;aid before, for the &s;turgeon to
come up rivers to depo&s;it its &s;pawn, is about the beginning of &s;ummer,
when the fi&s;hermen of all great rivers make a regular preparation for its
reception. At Pillau par|ticularly the &s;hores are formed into di&s;tricts,
and allotted to companies of fi&s;hermen, &s;ome of which are rented for about
three hundred pounds a year. The nets in which the &s;turgeon are caught, are
made of &s;mall cord, and placed acro&s;s the mouth of the river; but in &s;uch
a manner that, whether the tide ebbs or flows, the pouch of the net goes with
the &s;tream. The &s;turgeon thus caught, while in the water, is one of the
&s;tronge&s;t fi&s;hes that &s;wims, and often breaks the net to pieces that
enclo&s;es it; but the in&s;tant it is rai&s;ed with its head above water, all
its activity cea&s;es: it is then a lifele&s;s, &s;pirit|le&s;s lump, and
fuffers it&s;elf to be tamely drag|ged on &s;hore. It has been found prudent,
however, to draw it to &s;hore gently; for, if <PB N="280" REF="289"> excited
by any unnece&s;&s;ary violence, it has been found to break the fi&s;hermen's
legs with a blow of its tail. The mo&s;t experienced fi&s;hers, therefore, when
they have drawn it to the brink, keep the head &s;till elevated, which prevents
its doing any mi&s;chief with the hinder part of the body: others, by a nooze,
fa&s;ten the head and the tail together; and thus, without immediately
di&s;patching it, bring it to the market, if there be one near; or keep it till
their number is com|pleted for exportation.</P>
<P>The fle&s;h of this animal pickled is very well known at all
the tables of Europe; and is even more prized in England, than in any of the
countries where it is u&s;ually caught. The fi&s;h|ermen have two different
methods of preparing it. The one is by cutting it in long pieces lengthwi&s;e,
and having &s;alted them, by hang|ing them up in the &s;un to dry: the fi&s;h
thus prepared is &s;old in all the countries of the Levant, and &s;upplies the
want of better pro|vi&s;ion. The other method, which is u&s;ually practi&s;ed
in Holland, and along the &s;hores of the Baltic, is to cut the &s;turgeon
cro&s;swi&s;e into &s;hort pieces, and put it into &s;mall barrels, with a
pickle made of &s;alt and &s;aumure. This is the &s;turgeon which is &s;old in
England; and of which great quantities came from the north, 
<PB N="281" REF="290"> until we gave encouragement to the importa|tion of it
from North America. From thence we are very well &s;upplied; but it is &s;aid,
not with &s;uch good fi&s;h as tho&s;e imported from the north of Europe.</P>
<P>A very great trade is al&s;o carried on with the roe of the
&s;turgeon, pre&s;erved in a particular manner, and called Caviar: it is made
from the roe of all kinds of &s;turgeon, but particu|larly the &s;econd. This
is much more in reque&s;t in other countries of Europe than with us. To all
the&s;e high reli&s;hed meats, the appetite mu&s;t be formed by degrees; and
though formerly even in England it was very much in reque&s;t at the polite&s;t
tables, it is at pre&s;ent &s;unk entirely into difu&s;e. It is &s;till,
however, a con&s;iderable merchandize among the Turks, Greeks, and Venetians.
Caviar &s;omewhat re&s;embles &s;oft &s;oap in con&s;i&s;tence; but it is of a
brown, uni|form colour, and is eaten as chee&s;e with bread. The manner of
making it is this: they take the &s;pawn from the body of the
&s;turgeon&mdash;for it is to be ob&s;erved that the &s;turgeon differs from
other cartilaginous fi&s;h, in that it has &s;pawn like a cod, and not eggs
like a ray.&mdash;They take the &s;pawn, I &s;ay, and freeing it from the
&s;mall membranes that connect it together, they wa&s;h it with vinegar, and
afterwards &s;pread it <PB N="282" REF="291"> to dry upon a table; they then
put it into a ve&s;&s;el with &s;alt, breaking the &s;pawn with their hands,
and not with a pe&s;tle; this done, they put it into a canvas bag, letting the
liquor drain from it; la&s;tly, they put it in a tub, with holes in the bottom,
&s;o that, if there be any moi&s;ture &s;till remaining, it may run out: then
it is pre&s;&s;ed down, and covered up clo&s;e for u&s;e.</P>
<P>But the Hu&s;o or I&s;ingla&s;s Fi&s;h furni&s;hes a &s;till
more valuable commodity. This fi&s;h is caught in great quantities in the
Danube, from the months of October to January: it is &s;eldom under fifty
pounds weight, and often above four hundred: its fle&s;h is &s;oft, glutinous
and flabby; but it is &s;ometimes &s;alted, which makes it better ta&s;ted, and
then it turns red like &s;al|mon. It is for the commodity it furni&s;hes that
it is chiefly taken. I&s;ingla&s;s is of a whiti&s;h &s;ub|&s;tance, enclining
to yellow, done up into rolls, and &s;o exported for u&s;e. It is very well
known as &s;erviceable not only in medicine, but many arts. The varni&s;her,
the wine-merchant, and even the clothier know its u&s;es; and very great &s;ums
are yearly expended upon this &s;ingle ar|ticle of commerce. The manner of
making it is this: they take the &s;kin, the entrails, the fins and the tail of
this fi&s;h, and cut them into &s;mall pieces; the&s;e are left to macerate in
a &s;ufficient <PB N="283" REF="292"> quantity of warm water, and they are all
boiled &s;hortly after with a &s;low fire, until they are di&s;|&s;olved and
reduced to a jelly; this jelly is &s;pread upon in&s;truments made for the
purpo&s;e, &s;o, that drying, it a&s;&s;umes the form of parchment, and, when
quite dry, it is then rolled into the form which we &s;ee it in the
&s;hops.</P>
<P>This valuable commodity is principally fur|ni&s;hed from
Ru&s;&s;ia, where they prepare great quantities &s;urprizingly cheap. Mr.
Jack&s;on, an ingenious countryman of our own, found out an obvious method of
making a glue at home that an&s;wered all the purpo&s;es of i&s;ingla&s;s; but
what with the trouble of making it, and perhaps the arts put in practice to
under&s;ell him, he was, as I am told, obliged to di&s;continue the improvement
of his di&s;covery. Indeed, it is a vain attempt to manufacture among
our&s;elves tho&s;e things which may be more naturally and cheaply &s;upplied
el&s;ewhere. We have many traders that are unnaturally, if I may &s;o expre&s;s
it, employed among us; who furni&s;h more la|boriou&s;ly tho&s;e
nece&s;&s;aries with which other countries could ea&s;ily and cheaply &s;upply
us. It would be wi&s;er to take what they can thus produce; and to turn our
artizans to the encrea&s;e and manufacture of &s;uch productions as thrive more
readily among us. Were, for in&s;tance, <PB N="284" REF="293"> the number of
hands that we have now em|ployed in the manufacture of &s;ilk, turned to the
encrea&s;e of agriculture, it is probable that the encrea&s;ed quantity of corn
thus produced, would be more than an equivalent for the di|minution of national
wealth in purcha&s;ing wrought &s;ilk from other countries.</P>

<P><PB N="285" REF="295">OF all others, the cartilaginous cla&s;s
&s;eems to abound with the greate&s;t variety of ill-formed animals; and, if
philo&s;ophy could allow the ex|pre&s;&s;ion, we might &s;ay, that the
cartilaginous cla&s;s was the cla&s;s of mon&s;ters: in fact, it ex|hibits a
variety of &s;hapele&s;s beings, the devi|ations of which from the u&s;ual form
of fi&s;hes are beyond the power of words to de&s;cribe, and &s;carcely of the
pencil to draw. In this cla&s;s we have the Pipe Fi&s;h, that almo&s;t tapers
to a thread, and the Sun Fi&s;h, that has the appear|ance of a bulky head, but
the body cut off in the middle; the Hippocampus, with an head &s;omewhat like
that of an hor&s;e, and the Water Bat, who&s;e head can &s;carcely be
di&s;tingui&s;hed from the body. In this cla&s;s we find the Fi&s;hing Frog,
which from its deformity &s;ome have called the Sea Devil, the Chimaera, the
Lump Fi&s;h, the Sea Porcupine, and the Sea Snail. Of all the&s;e the hi&s;tory
is but little known; and naturali&s;ts &s;upply the place with
de&s;cription.</P>
<P>The Sun Fi&s;h &s;ometimes grows to a very 
<PB N="286" REF="296"> large &s;ize; one taken near Plymouth was five hundred
weight. In form it re&s;embles a bream, or &s;ome deep fi&s;h cut off in the
middle: the mouth is very &s;mall, and contains in each jaw two broad teeth,
with &s;harp edges: the colour of the back is du&s;ky and dappled, and the
belly is of a &s;ilvery white. When boiled, it has been ob&s;erved to turn to a
glutinous jelly, and would mo&s;t probably &s;erve for all the purpo&s;es of
i&s;ingla&s;s, were it found in &s;ufficient plenty.</P>
<P>The Fi&s;hing Frog in &s;hape very much re|&s;embles a tadpole
or young frog, but then a tadpole of enormous &s;ize, for it grows to above
five feet long, and its mouth is &s;ometimes a yard wide. Nothing can exceed
its deformity. The head is much bigger than the whole body; the under jaw
projects beyond the upper, and both are armed with rows of &s;lender, &s;harp
teeth: the palate and the tongue are furni&s;hed with teeth in like manner; the
eyes are placed on the top of the head, and are encompa&s;&s;ed with prickles:
immediately above the no&s;e are two long beards or filaments, &s;mall in the
beginning, but thicker at the end, and round: the&s;e, as it is &s;aid,
an&s;wer a very &s;ingular purpo&s;e; for being made &s;omewhat re&s;embling a
fi&s;hing-line, it is a&s;&s;erted, that the animal converts them to the
purpo&s;es of fi&s;hing. With the&s;e extended, as <PB N="287" REF="297"> Pliny
a&s;&s;erts, the fi&s;hing frog hides in muddy waters, and leaves nothing but
the beards to be &s;een; the curio&s;ity of the &s;maller fi&s;h bring them to
view the&s;e filaments, and their hunger induces them to &s;eize the bait; upon
which the animal in ambu&s;h in&s;tantly draws in its filaments with the little
fi&s;h that had taken the bait, and devours it without mercy. This &s;tory,
though apparently improbable, has found credit among &s;ome of our be&s;t
naturali&s;ts; but what induces me to doubt the fact is, that there is another
&s;pecies of this animal that has no beards, which it would not want if they
were nece&s;&s;ary to the exi&s;tence of the kind. Rondeletius informs us, that
if we take out the bowels, the body will appear with a kind of tran&s;parence;
and that if a lighted candle be placed within the body, as in a lanthorn, the
whole has a very formidable ap|pearance. The fi&s;hermen, however, have in
general a great regard for this ugly fi&s;h, as it is an enemy to the dog
fi&s;h, the bodies of tho&s;e fierce and voracious animals being often found in
its &s;tomach: whenever they take it, therefore, they always &s;et it at
liberty.</P>
<P>The Lump Fi&s;h is trifling in &s;ize, compared to the former:
its length is but &s;ixteen inches, and its weight about four pounds; the
&s;hape of the body is like that of a bream, deep, and it <PB N="288" REF="298"> &s;wims edgeways; the back is &s;harp and ele|vated, and the belly
flat; the lips, mouth and tongue of this animal are of a deep red; the whole
&s;kin is rough, with bony knobs, the large&s;t row is along the ridge of the
back; the belly is of a bright crim&s;on colour: but what makes the chief
&s;ingularity in this fi&s;h, is an oval aperture in the belly, &s;urrounded
with a fle&s;hy, &s;oft &s;ub&s;tance, that &s;eems bearded all round; by means
of this part it adheres with va&s;t force to any thing it plea&s;es. If flung
into a pail of water, it will &s;tick &s;o clo&s;e to the bottom, that on
taking the fi&s;h by the tail, one may lift up pail and all, though it holds
&s;everal gallons of water. Great numbers of the&s;e fi&s;h are found along the
coa&s;ts of Greenland in the beginning of &s;ummer, where they re&s;ort to
&s;pawn. Their roe is remarkably large, and the Greenlanders boil it to a pulp
for eating. They are ex|tremely fat, but not admired in England, being both
flabby and in&s;ipid.</P>
<P>The Sea Snail takes its name from the &s;oft and unctuous
texture of its body, re&s;embling the &s;nail upon land. It is almo&s;t
tran&s;parent, and &s;oon di&s;&s;olves and melts away. It is but a little
animal, being not above five inches long. The colour, when fre&s;h taken, is of
a pale brown, the &s;hape of the body round, and the <PB N="289" REF="299">
back fin reaches all the way from the head to the tail. Beneath the throat is a
round de|pre&s;&s;ion, of a whiti&s;h colour, &s;urrounded by twelve brown
&s;pots, placed in a circle. It is taken in England at the mouths of rivers,
four or five miles di&s;tant from the &s;ea.</P>
<P>The body of the Pipe Fi&s;h, in the thicke&s;t part, is not
thicker than a &s;wan-quill, while it is above &s;ixteen inches long. This is
angular, but the angles being not very &s;harp, they are not di&s;cernable
until the fi&s;h is dried. Its ge|neral colour is an olive brown, marked with
numbers of blui&s;h lines, pointing from the back to the belly. It is
viviparous; for, on cru&s;hing one that was ju&s;t taken, hundreds of very
mi|nute young ones were ob&s;erved to crawl about.</P>
<P>The Hippocampus, which from the form of its head &s;ome call
the Sea Hor&s;e, never exceeds nine inches in length. It is about as thick as a
man's thumb, and the body is &s;aid, while alive, to have hair on the fore
part, which falls off when it is dead. The &s;nout is a &s;ort of a tube with a
hole at the bottom, to which there is a cover, which the animal can open and
&s;hut at plea&s;ure. Behind the eyes there are two fins, which look like ears;
and above them are two holes, which &s;erve for re&s;piration. The whole body
&s;eems to be compo&s;ed of cartilagi|nous <PB N="290" REF="300"> rings, on the
intermediate membranes of which &s;everal &s;mall prickles are placed. It is
found in the Mediterranean, and al&s;o in the We&s;tern Ocean; and, upon the
whole, more re&s;embles a great caterpillar than a fi&s;h. The antients
con&s;idered it as extremely venomous; probably induced by its peculiar
figure.</P>
<P>From the&s;e harmle&s;s animals, covered with a &s;light coat
of mail, we may proceed to others, more thickly defended, and more formidably
armed, who&s;e exact &s;tation in the &s;cale of fi&s;hes is not yet
a&s;certained. While Linnaeus ranks them among the Cartilaginous kinds, a later
naturali&s;t places them among the Spinous cla&s;s. With which tribe they
mo&s;t agree, &s;ucceeding ob&s;ervations mu&s;t determine. At pre&s;ent, we
&s;eem better acquainted with their figure than their hi&s;tory: their
deformity is obvious; and the venemous nature of the greate&s;t number, has
been confirmed by fatal experience. This circum&s;tance, as well as the happy
di&s;tance at which they are placed from us, being all found in the Oriental or
American &s;eas, may have prevented a more critical enquiry; &s;o that we know
but little of the nature of their malig|nity, and &s;till le&s;s of their
pur&s;uits and enmities in the deep.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t of this tribe we may place the <PB REF="301">

</FIGURE> <PB N="291" REF="302"> Sea Orb, which is almo&s;t
round, has a mouth like a frog, and is from &s;even inches to two feet long.
Like the porcupine, from whence it &s;ometimes takes its name, being al&s;o
called the Sea Porcupine, it is covered over with long thorns or prickles,
which point on every &s;ide; and, when the animal is enraged, it can blow up
its body as round as a bladder. Of this ex|traordinary creature there are many
kinds: &s;ome threatening only with &s;pines, as the Sea Hedge-hog; others
defended with a bony hel|met that covers the head, as the O&s;tracion; others
with a coat of mail from the head to the tail, where it terminates in a point,
as the Cen|tri&s;cus; and others &s;till armed offen&s;ively and defen&s;ively
with bones and &s;pines, as the Shield Orb.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e &s;carce one is without its peculiar weapon of
offence. The centri&s;cus wounds with its &s;pine; the o&s;tracion poi&s;ons
with its venom; the orb is impregnable, and is ab|&s;olutely poi&s;onous, if
eaten. Indeed, their figure is not &s;uch as would tempt one to make the
experiment; and the natives of tho&s;e coun|tries where they are &s;ound, are
careful to inform foreigners of their danger: yet a certain &s;ailor at the
Cape of Good Hope, not believing what the Dutch told him concerning their
venom, <PB N="292" REF="303"> was re&s;olved to make the experiment, and break
through a prejudice which he &s;uppo&s;ed was founded on the animal's
deformity. He tried and eat one; but his ra&s;hne&s;s co&s;t him his life; he
in&s;tantly fell &s;ick, and died a few days after.</P>
<P>The&s;e frightful animals are of different &s;izes; &s;ome not
bigger than a foot-ball, and others as large as a bu&s;hel. They almo&s;t all
flatten and erect their &s;pines at plea&s;ure, and encrea&s;e the terrors of
their appearance in proportion to the approach of danger. At fir&s;t they
&s;eem more inoffen&s;ive; their body oblong, with all their weapons pointing
towards the tail; but upon being provoked or alarmed, the body that before
&s;eemed &s;mall &s;wells to the view; the animal vi&s;ibly grows rounder and
larger, and all its prickles &s;tand upright, and threaten the invader on every
&s;ide. The Americans often amu&s;e them&s;elves with the barren plea&s;ure of
catching the&s;e frightful creatures by a line and hook baited with a piece of
&s;ea-crab. The animal approaches the bait with its &s;pines flat|tened; but
when hooked and &s;topped by the line, &s;traight all its &s;pines are erected;
the whole body being armed in &s;uch a manner at all points, that it is
impo&s;&s;ible to lay hold of it on any part. For this rea&s;on it is dragged
to &s;ome di&s;tance from the water, and there it quickly <PB N="293" REF="304"> expires. In the middle of the belly of all the&s;e there is a &s;ort
of bag or bladder filled with air, and by the inflation of which the animal
&s;wells it&s;elf in the manner already mentioned.</P>
<P>In de&s;cribing the deformed animals of this cla&s;s, one is
&s;ometimes at a lo&s;s whether it be a fi&s;h or an in&s;ect that lies before
him. Thus the hippocampus and the pipe-fi&s;h bear a &s;trong re&s;emblance to
the caterpillar and the worm; while the le&s;&s;er orb bears &s;ome likene&s;s
to the cla&s;s of &s;ea-eggs to be de&s;cribed after. I will conclude this
account of cartilaginous fi&s;hes with the de|&s;cription of an animal which I
would &s;carcely call a fi&s;h, but that Father Labat dignifies it with the
name. Indeed, this cla&s;s teems with &s;uch a number of odd &s;haped animals,
that one is prompted to rank every thing extraordinary of the finny &s;pecies
among the number; but be|&s;ides, Labat &s;ays its bones are cartilaginous, and
that may entitle it to a place here.</P>
<P>The animal I mean is the Galley Fi&s;h, which Linnaeus
degrades into the in&s;ect tribe, under the title of the Medu&s;a, but which I
chu&s;e to place in this tribe, from its habits that are &s;ome|what &s;imilar.
To the eye of an unmindful &s;pectator, this fi&s;h &s;eems a tran&s;parent
bubble &s;wimming on the &s;urface of the &s;ea, or like a bladder variou&s;ly
and beautifully painted with <PB N="294" REF="305"> vivid colours, where red
and violet predominate as variou&s;ly oppo&s;ed to the beams of the &s;un. It
is however an actual fi&s;h; the body of which is compo&s;ed of cartilages, and
a very thin &s;kin filled with air, which thus keeps the animal floating on the
&s;urface as the waves and the winds happen to drive. Sometimes it is &s;een
thrown on the &s;hore by one wave, and again wa&s;hed back into the &s;ea by
another. Per&s;ons who happen to be walking along the &s;hore often happen to
tread upon the&s;e animals; and the bur&s;ting of their body yields a report
like that when one treads upon the &s;wim of a fi&s;h. It has eight broad feet
with which it &s;wims, or which it expands to catch the air as with a &s;ail.
It fa&s;tens it&s;elf to whatever it meets by means of its legs, which have an
adhe&s;ive quality. Whether they move when on &s;hore Labat could never
per|ceive, though he did every thing to make them &s;tir; he only &s;aw that it
&s;trongly adhered to whatever &s;ub&s;tances he applied it. It is very common
in America, and grows to the &s;ize of a goo&s;e egg, or &s;omewhat more. It is
perpe|tually &s;een floating; and no efforts that are u&s;ed to hurt it can
&s;ink it to the bottom. All that appears above water is a bladder clear and
tran&s;parent as gla&s;s, and &s;hining with the mo&s;t beautiful colours of
the rainbow. Beneath, in <PB N="295" REF="306"> the water, are four of the feet
already men|tioned that &s;erve as oars, while the other four are expanded
above to &s;ail with. But what is mo&s;t remarkable in this extraordinary
creature is the violent pungency of the &s;limy &s;ub&s;tance with which its
legs are &s;meared. If the &s;malle&s;t quantity but touch the &s;kin, &s;o
cau&s;tic is its quality, that it burns it like hot oil dropped on the part
affected. The pain is wor&s;t in the heat of the day, but cea&s;es in the cool

certain the&s;e animals are extremely common along all the coa&s;ts in the Gulf

<PB N="300" REF="308">former are trifling in compari&s;on, and make not above a
fifth part of the finny creation.</P>
<P>From the great variety in this cla&s;s, it is ob|vious how
difficult a ta&s;k it mu&s;t have been to de&s;cribe or remember even a part of
what it contains. When &s;ix hundred different &s;orts of animals offer
them&s;elves to con&s;ideration, the mind is bewildered in the multiplicity of
objects that all lay &s;ome claim to its attention. To obviate this
confu&s;ion, &s;y&s;tems have been de|vi&s;ed, which, throwing &s;everal
fi&s;hes that agree in many particulars into one groupe, and thus uniting all
into &s;o many particular bodies, the mind that was incapable of &s;eparately
con|&s;idering each, is enabled to comprehend all when thus offered in larger
ma&s;&s;es to its con|&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Indeed, of all the beings in animated nature, fi&s;hes
mo&s;t demand a &s;y&s;tematical arrangement. Quadrupedes are but few, and can
be all known; birds, from their &s;eldom varying in their &s;ize, can be very
tolerably di&s;tingui&s;hed without &s;y&s;tem; but among fi&s;hes, which no
&s;ize can di&s;criminate, where the animal ten inches and the animal ten feet
long is entirely the &s;ame, there mu&s;t be &s;ome other criterion by which
they are to be di&s;tingui&s;hed; &s;omething that gives preci&s;ion to our
ideas of the animal who&s;e hi&s;tory we de&s;ire to know.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="309">Of the real hi&s;tory of fi&s;hes,
very little is yet known; but of very many we have full and &s;ufficient
accounts, as to their external form. It would be unpardonable, therefore, in an
hi|&s;tory of the&s;e animals, not to give the little we do know; and, at
lea&s;t, arrange our forces, though we cannot tell their de&s;tination. In this
art of arrangement, Artedi and Linnaeus have long been con&s;picuous: they have
both taken a view of the animal's form in different lights; and, from the parts
which mo&s;t &s;truck them, have founded their re&s;pective &s;y&s;tems.</P>
<P>Artedi, who was foremo&s;t, perceiving that &s;ome fi&s;hes
had hard prickly fins, as the pike; that others had &s;oft pliant ones, as the
herring; and that others &s;till wanted that particular fin, by which the gills
are opened and &s;hut, as the eel, made out a &s;y&s;tem from the&s;e
varieties. Linnaeus, on the other hand, rejecting this &s;y&s;tem, which he
found liable to too many ex|ceptions, con&s;idered the fins, not with regard to
their &s;ub&s;tance, but their po&s;ition. The ventral fins &s;eem to be the
great object of his &s;y&s;tem; he con&s;iders them in fi&s;hes &s;upplying the
&s;ame offices as feet in quadrupedes; and from their total ab&s;ence, or from
their being &s;ituated nearer the head or the tail, in different fi&s;hes, he
takes the differences of his &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="310">The&s;e arrangements, which are
totally ar|bitrary, and which are rather a method than a &s;cience, are always
fluctuating; and the la&s;t is generally preferred to that which went before.
There has lately appeared, however, a &s;y&s;tem, compo&s;ed by Mr. Gouan of
Montpellier, that de&s;erves applau&s;e for more than its novelty. It appears
to me the be&s;t arrangement of this kind that ever was made; and in it the
divi&s;ions are not only preci&s;ely &s;y&s;tematical, but in &s;ome mea&s;ure
adopted by nature it&s;elf. This learned French|man has united the &s;y&s;tems
of Artedi and Lin|naeus together; and by bringing one to correct the other, has
made out a number of tribes, that are marked with the utmo&s;t preci&s;ion. A
part of his &s;y&s;tem, however, we have already gone through in the
cartilaginous, or, as he calls a part of them, the <HI>branchio&s;tegous</HI>
tribe of fi&s;hes. In the arrangement of the&s;e I have followed Linnaeus, as
the number of them was but &s;mall, and his method &s;imple. But in that which
is more properly called the Spinous cla&s;s of fi&s;hes, I will follow Mr.
Gouan's &s;y&s;tem; the terms of which, as well as of all the former
&s;y&s;tems, require &s;ome explanation. I do not love to multiply the
technical terms of a &s;cience; but it often happens that names, by being long
u&s;ed, are as nece&s;&s;ary to be known as the &s;cience it&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="311">If we con&s;ider the &s;ub&s;tance of
the fin of a fi&s;h, we &s;hall find it compo&s;ed, be&s;ides the &s;kin,
either of &s;traight, hard, pointed, bony prickles or &s;pines, as in the pike;
or of &s;oft, crooked or forked bones, or cartilages, as in the her|ring. The
fi&s;h that have bony prickly fins, are called Prickly Finned Fi&s;h; the
latter, that have &s;oft or cartilaginous fins, are called, Soft Finned Fi&s;h.
The prickly finned fi&s;h have received the Greek new-formed name of
<HI>Acan|thopterigii</HI>; the &s;oft finned fi&s;h have likewi&s;e their
barbarous Greek name of <HI>Malacopterigii.</HI> Thus far Artedi has &s;upplied
Mr. Gouan with names and divi&s;ions. All Spinous fi&s;h are di|vided into
Prickly finned fi&s;h, and Soft finned fi&s;h.</P>
<P>Again, Linnaeus has taught him to remark the &s;ituation of
the fins: for the ventral or belly fins, which are tho&s;e particularly to be
re|marked, are either wholly wanting, as in the eel, and then the fi&s;h is
called <HI>Apodal</HI> (a Greek word &s;ignifying without feet); or the ventral
fins are placed more forward than the pectoral fins, as in the haddock, and
then the animal is called a <HI>Jugular</HI> fi&s;h; or the ventral fins are
placed directly under the pectoral fins, as in the father-la&s;her, and then it
is called a <HI>Tho|racic</HI> fi&s;h: or, la&s;tly, the ventral fins are
placed <PB N="304" REF="312"> nearer the tail than the pectoral fins, as in the
minow, and then it is an <HI>Abdominal</HI> fi&s;h.</P>
<P>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the&s;e di&s;tributions, the French
na|turali&s;t mixes and unites them into two grand divi&s;ions. All the prickly
finned fi&s;h make one general divi&s;ion; all the &s;oft finned fi&s;h
another. The&s;e fir&s;t are di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other, as being either
<HI>apodal, jugular, thoracic</HI> or <HI>abdominal.</HI> Thus there are
prickly finned <HI>apodal</HI> fi&s;hes; prickly finned <HI>jugular</HI>
fi&s;hes, prickly finned <HI>tho|racic</HI> fi&s;hes, and prickly finned
<HI>abdominal</HI> fi&s;hes. On the other hand, the &s;oft finned fi&s;hes fall
un|der a &s;imilar di&s;tribution, and make the other ge|neral divi&s;ion. Thus
there are &s;oft finned <HI>apodal</HI> fi&s;hes, &s;oft finned
<HI>jugular</HI> fi&s;hes, &s;oft finned <HI>tho|racic</HI> fi&s;hes, and
&s;oft finned <HI>abdominal</HI> fi&s;hes. The&s;e general characters are
&s;trongly marked, and ea&s;ily remembered. It only remains, there|fore, to
divide the&s;e into &s;uch tribes as are mo&s;t &s;trongly marked by nature;
and to give the di|&s;tinct characters of each, to form a complete &s;y&s;tem
with great &s;implicity. This Mr. Gouan has done; and the tribes into which he
has di|&s;tributed each of the&s;e divi&s;ions, exactly amount to fifty. Thus
the reader, who can contain in his memory the characteri&s;tic marks of fifty
kinds, will have a tolerable idea of the form of every kind of &s;pinous
fi&s;h. I &s;ay, of the form; for <PB N="305" REF="313"> as to the hi&s;tory
and the nature of the animal it&s;elf, that can only be obtained by experience

any fi&s;h that offers, we can know its rank, its affinities, and partly its

&s;hew the u&s;e of this &s;y&s;tem &s;till more apparently, &s;uppo&s;e I meet
with a fi&s;h, the name to me unknown, of which I de&s;ire to know &s;omething
more. The way is fir&s;t to &s;ee whether it be a cartilaginous fi&s;h, which
may be known by its wanting fins to open and &s;hut the gills, which the
cartilaginous kinds are wholly without. If I find that it has them, then it is
a &s;pinous fi&s;h; and, in order to know its kind, I examine its fins, whether
they be prickly or &s;oft: I find them &s;oft; it is there|fore to be ranked
among the &s;oft finned fi&s;hes. I then examine its ventral or belly fins, and
finding that the fi&s;h has them, I look for their &s;ituation, and find they
lie nearer to the tail than the pectoral fins. By this I find the animal to be
a &s;oft finned abdominal fi&s;h. Then, to know which of the kinds of the&s;e
fi&s;hes it is, I examine its figure and the &s;hape of its head, I find the
body rather oblong; the head with a <PB N="316" REF="324"> &s;mall beak; the
lower jaw like a &s;aw; the fin covering the gills with eight rays. This animal
mu&s;t therefore be the herring, or one of that family, &s;uch as the pilchard,
the &s;prat, the &s;had, or the anchovy. To give another in&s;tance: Upon
examining the fins of a fi&s;h to me un|known, I find them prickly; I then
lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">k for the &s;ituation of the
ventral fins, I find them entirely wanting; this then mu&s;t be a prickly
finned apodal fi&s;h. Of this kind there are but three; and by comparing the
fi&s;h with the de|&s;cription, I find it either of the trichurus kind, the
&s;word-fi&s;h, or the gilt head. Upon examining al&s;o its internal
&s;tructure, I &s;hall find a very great &s;imilitude between my fi&s;h and
that placed at the head of the family.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of Spinous Fi&s;hes in General.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING given a method by which &s;pinous fi&s;hes may be
di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other, the hi&s;tory of each in particular might
natu|rally be expected to follow: but &s;uch a di&s;tinct account of each would
be very di&s;gu&s;ting, from the unavoidable uniformity of every de&s;cription.
The hi&s;tory of any one of this cla&s;s very much re&s;embles that of all the
re&s;t: they breathe air and water through the gills; they live by ra|pine,
each devouring &s;uch animals as its mouth is capable of admitting; and they
propagate, not by bringing forth their young alive, as in the cetaceous tribes,
nor by di&s;tinct eggs, as in the generality of the cartilaginous tribes, but
by &s;pawn, or peas, as they are generally called, which they produce by
hundreds of thou&s;ands. The&s;e are the leading marks that run through their
whole hi&s;tory, and which have &s;o much &s;welled books with tire&s;ome
repetition.</P>
<P>It will be &s;ufficient therefore to draw this nu|merous
cla&s;s into one point of view, and to mark how they differ from the former
cla&s;&s;es; and what they po&s;&s;e&s;s peculiarly &s;triking, &s;o as 
<PB N="318" REF="326"> to di&s;tingui&s;h them from each other. The fir&s;t
object that pre&s;ents it&s;elf, and that by which they differ from all others,
are the bones. The&s;e, when examined but &s;lightly, appear to be entirely
&s;olid; yet, when viewed more clo&s;ely, every bone will be found hollow, and
filled with a &s;ub&s;tance le&s;s rancid and oily than mar|row. The&s;e bones
are very numerous, and pointed; and, as in quadrupedes, are the props or
&s;tays to which the mu&s;cles are fixed which move the different parts of the
body.</P>
<P>The number of bones in all &s;pinous fi&s;hes of the &s;ame
kind, is always the &s;ame. It is a vulgar way of &s;peaking to &s;ay, that
fi&s;hes are at &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons more bony than at others; but this &s;carce
requires contradiction. It is true indeed, that fi&s;h are at &s;ome
&s;ea&s;ons much fatter than at others; &s;o that the quantity of the fle&s;h
being dimini&s;hed, and that of the bones remaining the &s;ame, they appear to
encrea&s;e in number, as they actually bear a greater proportion.</P>
<P>All fi&s;h of the &s;ame kind, as was &s;aid, have the &s;ame
number of bones: the &s;keleton of a fi&s;h, however irregularly the bones may
fall in our way at table, has its members very regularly di&s;po&s;ed; and
every bone has its fixed place, with as much preci&s;ion as we find in the
orders of a regular fabric. But then &s;pinous fi&s;h differ 
<PB N="319" REF="327"> in the number of bones according to the &s;pecies; for
&s;ome have a greater number of fins by which they move in the water. The
number in each is always in proportion to the number and &s;ize of the&s;e
fins: for every fi&s;h has a regular apparatus of bones and mu&s;cles, by which
the fins are moved; and all tho&s;e fi&s;h where they are nume|rous or large,
mu&s;t, of con&s;equence, be con&s;ider|ably bony. Indeed, in the larger
fi&s;h, the quantity of fle&s;h is &s;o much, and the bones them&s;elves are
&s;o large, that they are ea&s;ily &s;een and &s;eparated: but in the &s;maller
kinds with many fins, the bones are as numerous as in the great; yet being &s;o
very minute, they lurk almo&s;t in every part of the fle&s;h, and are dangerous
as well as trouble&s;ome to be eaten. In a word, tho&s;e fi&s;h which are
large, fat, and have few fins, are found to be the lea&s;t bony; tho&s;e which
are &s;mall, lean, and have many fins, are the mo&s;t bony of all others. Thus,
for in&s;tance, a roach appears more bony than a carp, becau&s;e it is leaner
and &s;maller; and it is actually more bony than an eel, becau&s;e it has a
greater num|ber of fins.</P>
<P>As the &s;pinous fi&s;h partake le&s;s of the qua|drupede in
their formation than any others, &s;o they can bear to live out of their own
element a &s;horter time. In general, when taken out of <PB N="320" REF="328">
the water, they te&s;tify their change by panting more violently and at
clo&s;er intervals, the thin air not furni&s;hing their gills the proper play;
and in a few minutes they expire. Some indeed are more vivacious in air than
others; the eel will live &s;everal hours out of water; and the carp has been
known to be fattened in a damp cellar. The method is by placing it in a net
well wrapped up in wet mo&s;s, the mouth only out, and then hung up in a vault.
The fi&s;h is fed with white bread and milk; and the net now and then plunged
into the water. The animal, thus managed, has been known not only to live for a
fortnight, but to grow exceedingly fat, and of a &s;uperior flavour. From this
it would &s;eem, that the want of moi&s;ture in the gills, is the chief cau&s;e
of the death of the&s;e animals; and could that be &s;upplied, their lives
might be prolonged in the air, almo&s;t as well as in their own element.</P>
<P>Yet it is impo&s;&s;ible to account for the different
operations of the &s;ame element, upon animals, that, to appearance, have the
&s;ame conformation. To &s;ome fi&s;hes, bred in the &s;ea, fre&s;h water is
immediate de&s;truction: on the other hand, &s;ome fi&s;hes, that live in our
lakes and ponds, cannot bear the &s;alt water. Whence this dif|ference can
ari&s;e, is not ea&s;y to be accounted <PB N="321" REF="329"> for. The &s;aline
quality of the water cannot properly be given as the cau&s;e; &s;ince no
fi&s;hes imbibe any of the &s;ea's &s;altne&s;s with their food, or in
re&s;piration. The fle&s;h of all fi&s;hes is equally fre&s;h, both in the
river, and at the &s;alte&s;t depths of the ocean; the &s;alt of the element in
which they live, no way mixing with their con&s;titution. Whence then is it
that ani|mals will live only there; and will quickly ex|pire, when carried into
fre&s;h water? It may probably ari&s;e from the &s;uperior weight of the
&s;ea-water. As from the great quantity of &s;alt di&s;&s;olved in its
compo&s;ition, it is much heavier than fre&s;h water, &s;o it is probable it
lies with greater force upon the organs of re&s;piration, and gives them their
proper and nece&s;&s;ary play: on the other hand, tho&s;e fi&s;h which are
u&s;ed only to fre&s;h water, cannot bear the weight of the &s;aline fluid, and
expire in a manner &s;uf|focated in the gro&s;sne&s;s of the &s;trange
element.</P>
<P>But though there are &s;ome tribes that live only in the
&s;ea, and others only in fre&s;h water, yet there are &s;ome who&s;e organs
are equally adapted to either element; and that &s;pend a part of their
&s;ea&s;on in one, and a part in the other. Thus the &s;almon, the &s;had, the
&s;melt, and the flounder, annually quit their native ocean, and come up our
rivers to depo&s;ite their <PB N="322" REF="330"> &s;pawn. This &s;eems the
mo&s;t important bu|&s;ine&s;s of their lives; and there is no danger which
they will not encounter, even to the &s;urmounting precipices, to find a proper
place for the depo&s;ition of their future offspring. The &s;almon, upon
the&s;e occa&s;ions, is &s;een to a&s;cend rivers five hundred miles from the
&s;ea; and to brave not only the danger of various enemies, but al&s;o to
&s;pring up cataracts as high as a hou&s;e. As &s;oon as they come to the
bot|tom of the torrent, they &s;eem di&s;appointed to meet the ob&s;truction,
and &s;wim &s;ome paces back: they then take a view of the danger that lies
before them, &s;urvey it motionle&s;s for &s;ome minutes, advance, and again
retreat; till at la&s;t &s;ummoning up all their force, they take a leap from
the bottom, their body &s;traight, and &s;trongly in motion; and thus mo&s;t
frequently clear every ob&s;truction. It &s;ometimes happens, however, that
they want &s;trength to make the leap; and then, in our fi&s;heries, they are
taken in their de&s;cent. But this is one of the &s;malle&s;t dangers that
attend the&s;e adventuring animals in their progre&s;s: numberle&s;s are the
methods of taking them; as well by the hook, as by nets, ba&s;kets, and other
inventions, which it is not our bu&s;ine&s;s here to de&s;cribe. Their capture
makes, in &s;everal countries, a great article of commerce; and being cured in
&s;everal different <PB REF="331">

pickling, or drying, they are &s;ent to all the markets of Europe.</P>
<P>As the&s;e mount up the rivers to depo&s;ite their &s;pawn,
others, particularly the eel, de&s;cend the fre&s;h water &s;tream, as Redi
a&s;&s;ures us, to bring forth their young in the &s;ea. About the month of
Augu&s;t, annually, the&s;e animals take the opportunity of the mo&s;t
ob&s;cure nights, and when the rivers are flooded by ac|cidental rains, &s;eek
the ocean. When they have reached the &s;ea, and produced their young, for they
are viviparous, they again a&s;cend the &s;tream, at different times, as
opportunity offers, or as the &s;ea&s;on is favourable or tempe&s;tuous. Their
pa&s;&s;age begins u&s;ually about the end of January, and continues till
towards the end of May, when they are taken in the river Arno by millions, and
&s;o &s;mall that a thou&s;and of them goes to a pound. There is nothing more
certain than, that they de&s;cend in our own rivers after floods, in great
abundance, and are thus caught in nets, to very great advantage. They are
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed al&s;o of a power of climbing over any ob&s;tacle; for, by
applying their glutinous and &s;limy bodies to the &s;urface of the object they
de&s;ire to &s;urmount, they can thus creep up locks, weirs, and every thing
that would prevent their a&s;cending the current of the &s;tream.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="333">But the length of the voyage performed
by the&s;e fi&s;hes, is &s;port, if compared to what is annually undertaken by
&s;ome tribes, that con|&s;tantly re&s;ide in the ocean. The&s;e are known to
take a cour&s;e of three or four thou&s;and miles in a &s;ea&s;on; &s;erving
for prey to whales, &s;harks, and the numerous flocks of water-fowl, that
regularly wait to intercept their progre&s;s. The&s;e may be called fi&s;h of
pa&s;&s;age, and bear a &s;trong analogy to birds of pa&s;&s;age, both from
their &s;ocial di&s;po&s;ition, and the immen&s;ity of their numbers. Of this
kind are the cod, the haddock, the whiting, the mackrel, the tunny, the
herring, and the pilchard. Other fi&s;h live in our vicinity, and re&s;ide on
our coa&s;ts all the year round; or keep in the depths of the ocean, and are
but &s;eldom &s;een: but the&s;e, at &s;tated &s;ea&s;ons, vi&s;it their
accu&s;tomed haunts with re|gular certainty, generally returning the &s;ame
week in the &s;ucceeding year, and often the &s;ame day.</P>
<P>The &s;tated returns, and the regular progre&s;s of the&s;e

are que&s;tions that curio&s;ity may a&s;k, but philo&s;ophy can hardly
re&s;olve. We mu&s;t di&s;mi&s;s enquiry, &s;atisfied with the certainty of the
facts.</P>
<P>The cod &s;eems to be the foremo&s;t of this wandering tribe;
and is only found in our northern part of the world. This animal's chief place
of re&s;ort is on the banks of New|foundland, and the other &s;and banks that
lie off Cape-Breton. That exten&s;ive flat &s;eems to be no other than the
broad top of a &s;ea-mountain, extending for above five hundred miles long, and
&s;urrounded with a deeper &s;ea. Hither the cod annually repair in numbers
beyond the power of calculation, to feed on the quantity of worms that are to
be found there in the &s;andy bottom. Here they are taken in &s;uch quantities,
that they &s;upply all Europe with a con&s;iderable &s;hare of provi&s;ion. The
Engli&s;h have &s;tages erected all along the &s;hore for &s;alting and drying
them; and the fi&s;hermen, who take them with the hook and line, which is their
method, draw them in as fa&s;t as they can throw out. This immen&s;e capture,
however, makes but a very &s;mall diminution, when compared to their num|bers;
and when their provi&s;ion there is ex|hau&s;ted, or the &s;ea&s;on for
propagation returns, they go off to the polar &s;eas, where they depo|&s;ite 
<PB N="326" REF="336"> their roes in full &s;ecurity. From thence want of food
forces them, as &s;oon as the fir&s;t more &s;outhern &s;eas are open, to
repair &s;outhward for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Nor is this fi&s;h an unfrequent
vi&s;itant upon our own &s;hores: but the returns are not &s;o regular, nor
does the capture bear any proportion to that at Newfoundland.</P>
<P>The haddock, the whiting, and the mackrel, are thought, by
&s;ome, to be driven upon our coa&s;ts rather by their fears than their
appetites; and it is to the pur&s;uit of larger fi&s;hes, we owe their welcome
vi&s;its. It is much more probable, that they come for that food which is found
in more plenty near the &s;hore, than farther out at &s;ea One thing is
remarkable, that their mi|grations &s;eem to be regularly conducted. The grand
&s;hoal of haddocks that comes periodically on the York&s;hire coa&s;ts,
appeared there in a body on the tenth of December, 1766; and exactly on the
&s;ame day, in the following year. This &s;hoal extended from the &s;hore near
three miles in breadth, and in length for more than forty. The limits of a
&s;hoal are preci&s;ely known; for if the fi&s;hermen put down their lines at
the di&s;tance of more than three miles from &s;hore, they catch nothing but
dog fi&s;h: a proof that the haddock is not there.</P>
<P>But of all migrating fi&s;h, the herring and the pilchard take
the mo&s;t adventurous voyages. <PB N="327" REF="337"> Herrings are found in
the greate&s;t abundance in the highe&s;t northern latitudes. In tho&s;e
inac|ce&s;&s;ible &s;eas, that are covered with ice for a great part of the
year, the herring and pil|chard find a quiet and &s;ure retreat from all their
numerous enemies: thither neither man, nor their &s;till more de&s;tructive
enemy, the fin fi&s;h, or the cachalot, dares to pur&s;ue them. The quantity of
in&s;ect food which tho&s;e &s;eas &s;upply, is very great; whence, in that
remote &s;ituation, defended by the icy rigour of the climate, they live at
ea&s;e, and multiply beyond expre&s;&s;ion. From this mo&s;t de&s;irable
retreat, Ander&s;on &s;uppo&s;es, they would never depart, but that their
numbers render it nece&s;&s;ary for them to migrate; and, as with bees from a
hive, they are compelled to &s;eek for other retreats.</P>
<P>For this rea&s;on, the great colony is &s;een to &s;et out
from the icy &s;ea about the middle of winter; compo&s;ed of numbers, that if
all the men in the world were to be loaded with her|rings, they would not carry
the thou&s;andth part away. But they no &s;ooner leave their retreats, but
millions of enemies appear to thin their &s;quadrons. The fin-fi&s;h and the
cachalot &s;wallow barrels at a yawn; the porpus, the grampus, the &s;hark, and
the whole numerous tribe of dog-fi&s;h, find them an ea&s;y prey, and 
<PB N="328" REF="338"> de&s;i&s;t from making war upon each other: but &s;till
more, the unnumbered flocks of &s;ea-fowl that chiefly inhabit near the pole,
watch the out&s;et of their dangerous migration, and &s;pread exten&s;ive
ruin.</P>
<P>In this exigence, the defencele&s;s emigrants find no other
&s;afety but by crouding clo&s;er to|gether, and leaving to the outmo&s;t bands
the danger of being the fir&s;t devoured; thus, like &s;heep when frighted,
that always run together in a body, and each finding &s;ome protection in being
but one of many that are equally liable to inva&s;ion, they are &s;een to
&s;eparate into &s;hoals, one body of which moves to the we&s;t, and pours down
along the coa&s;ts of America, as far &s;outh as Carolina, and but &s;eldom
farther. In Che&s;e|peak Bay, the annual inundation of the&s;e fi&s;h is &s;o
great, that they cover the &s;hores in &s;uch quan|tites as to become a
nui&s;ance. Tho&s;e that hold more to the ea&s;t, and come down towards
Eu|rope, endeavour to &s;ave them&s;elves from their mercile&s;s pur&s;uers, by
approaching the fir&s;t &s;hore they can find; and that which fir&s;t offers in
their de&s;cent, is the coa&s;t of Iceland, in the beginning of March. Upon
their arrival on that coa&s;t, their phalanx, which has already &s;uffered
con&s;iderable diminutions, is neverthele&s;s of amazing extent, depth, and
clo&s;ene&s;s, covering <PB N="329" REF="339"> an extent of &s;hore as large as
the i&s;land it&s;elf. The whole water &s;eems alive; and is &s;een &s;o black
with them to a great di&s;tance, that the number &s;eems inexhau&s;tible. There
the porpe&s;s and the &s;hark continue their depredations; and the birds devour
what quantities they plea&s;e. By the&s;e enemies the herrings are cooped up
into &s;o clo&s;e a body, that a &s;hovel, or any hollow ve&s;&s;el put into
the water, takes them up without farther trouble.</P>
<P>That body which comes upon our coa&s;ts, begins to appear off
the Shetland I&s;les in April. The&s;e are the forerunners of the grand &s;hoal
which de&s;cends in June; while its arrival is ea&s;ily announced, by the
number of its greedy at|tendants, the gannet, the gull, the &s;hark and the
porpe&s;s. When the main body is arrived, its breadth and depth is &s;uch as to
alter the very appearance of the ocean. It is divided into di&s;tinct columns,
of five or &s;ix miles in length, and three or four broad; while the water
before them curls up, as if forced out of its bed. Sometimes they &s;ink for
the &s;pace of ten or fifteen minutes, then ri&s;e again to the &s;urface; and,
in bright weather, reflect a variety of &s;plendid colours, like a field
be&s;pangled with purple, gold and azure. The fi&s;hermen are ready prepared to
give them a proper recep|tion; <PB N="330" REF="340"> and, by nets made for the
occa&s;ion, they take &s;ometimes above two thou&s;and barrels at a &s;ingle
draught.</P>
<P>From the Shetland I&s;les, another body of this great army,
where it divides, goes off to the we&s;tern coa&s;ts of Ireland, where they
meet with a &s;econd nece&s;&s;ity of dividing. The one takes to the Atlantic,
where it is &s;oon lo&s;t in that exten&s;ive ocean; the other pa&s;&s;es into
the Iri&s;h &s;ea, and furni&s;hes a very con&s;iderable capture to the
natives.</P>
<P>In this manner, the herrings expelled from their native
&s;eas, &s;eek tho&s;e bays and &s;hores where they can find food, and the
be&s;t defence again&s;t their unmerciful pur&s;uers of the deep. In general,
the mo&s;t inhabited &s;hores are the places where the larger animals of the
deep are lea&s;t fond of pur&s;uing; and the&s;e are cho&s;en by the herring as
an a&s;ylum from greater dangers. Thus, along the coa&s;ts of Norway, the
German &s;hores, and the northern &s;hores of France, the&s;e animals are found
punctual in their vi&s;itations. In the&s;e different places they produce their
young; which, when come to &s;ome degree of maturity, attend the general
motions. After the de&s;truction of &s;uch numbers, the quantity that attempts
to return is but &s;mall; and An|der&s;on doubts whether they ever return.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="341">Such is the account given of the
migration of the&s;e fi&s;hes, by one who, of all others, was be&s;t acquainted
with their hi&s;tory; and yet many doubts ari&s;e, in every part of the
migration. The mo&s;t obvious which has been made is, that though &s;uch
numbers peri&s;h in their de&s;cent from the north, yet, in compari&s;on to
tho&s;e that &s;urvive the account is trifling. and it is &s;up|po&s;ed, that
of tho&s;e taken by man, the propor|tion is not one to a million. Their
regularly leaving the &s;hore al&s;o at a &s;tated time, would imply that they
are not in the&s;e vi&s;its under the impul&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity. In fact,
there &s;eems one cir|cum&s;tance that &s;hews the&s;e animals governed by a
choice with re&s;pect to the &s;hores they pitch upon; and not blindly drove
from one &s;hore to another. What I mean is, their fixing upon &s;ome &s;hores
for &s;everal &s;ea&s;ons, or indeed, for &s;everal ages together; and, after
having regularly vi&s;ited them every year, then capriciou&s;ly for&s;aking
them, never more to return. The fir&s;t great bank for herrings was along the
&s;hores of Norway. Before the year 1584, the number of &s;hips from all parts
of Europe that re&s;orted to that &s;hore, exceeded &s;ome thou&s;ands. The
quantity of herrings that were then a&s;&s;embled there, was &s;uch, that a man
who &s;hould put a &s;pear in the water, as Olaus Magnus a&s;&s;erts, would
&s;ee it <PB N="332" REF="342"> &s;tand on end, being prevented from falling.
But &s;oon after that period, the&s;e animals were &s;een to de&s;ert the
Norway &s;hores, and took up along the German coa&s;t, where the Han&s;e-towns
drove a very great trade by their capture and &s;ale; but, for above a century,
the herrings have, in a great mea&s;ure, for&s;aken them; and their greate&s;t
colonies are &s;een in the Briti&s;h channel, and upon the Iri&s;h &s;hores. It
is not ea&s;y to a&s;&s;ign a cau&s;e for this &s;eemingly ca|pricious
de&s;ertion: whether the number of their finny enemies encrea&s;ing along the
northern coa&s;ts, may have terrified the herring tribe from their former
places of re&s;ort; or, whether the quantity of food being greater in the
Briti&s;h channel, may not allure them thither, is not ea&s;y to determine!</P>
<P>The pilchard, which is a fi&s;h differing little from the
herring, makes the coa&s;t of Cornwall its place of principal re&s;ort. Their
arrival on that coa&s;t is &s;oon proclaimed by their attendants the birds, and
the larger fi&s;hes; and the whole country prepare to take the advantage of
this trea&s;ure, providentially thrown before them. The natives &s;ometimes
enclo&s;e a bay of &s;everal miles extent with their nets called &s;aines. To
direct them in their operations, there were &s;ome years ago (but I believe
they are di&s;continued) &s;everal <PB N="333" REF="343"> men placed on
eminencies near the &s;hore, called <HI>huers,</HI> who, with brooms in their
hands, gave &s;ignals where the nets were to be extended, and where the
&s;hoals of fi&s;hes lay: this they perceived by the colour of the water, which
a&s;&s;umed a tincture from the &s;hoals beneath. By the&s;e means, they
&s;ometimes take twelve or fifteen hundred barrels of pilchards at a draught;
and they place them in heaps on the &s;hore. It often happens, that the
quantity caught exceeds the &s;alt or the uten&s;ils for curing them; and then
they are carried off to &s;erve for the pur|po&s;es of manure. This fi&s;hery
employs nor only great numbers of men at &s;ea, training them to naval affairs,
but al&s;o numbers of women and children at land, in &s;alting and curing the
fi&s;h; in making boats, nets, ropes and ca&s;ks, for the purpo&s;es of taking
or fitting them for &s;ale. The poor are fed with the &s;uperfluity of the
capture; the land is manured with the offals: the merchant finds the gain of
commi&s;&s;ion, and hone&s;t commerce; the fi&s;herman a comfortable
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence from his toil. 
<Q REND="inline">"Ships," &s;ays Dr. Borla&s;e, "are often
freighted hither with &s;alt, and into foreign countries with the fi&s;h,
car|rying off at the &s;ame time a part of our tin. The u&s;ual produce of the
number of hog&s;|heads exported for ten years, from 1747 to 
<PB N="334" REF="344"> 1756 inclu&s;ive, amounted to near thirty thou&s;and
hog&s;heads each year: every hog&s;|head has amounted, upon an average, to the
price of one pound, thirteen &s;hillings and three-pence. Thus the money paid
for pil|chards exported, has annually amounted to near fifty thou&s;and
pounds."</Q></P>
<P>Whence the&s;e infinite numbers are derived, &s;till remains
ob&s;cure; but it will encrea&s;e our wonder to be told, that &s;o &s;mall a
fi&s;h as the &s;tickleback, which is &s;eldom above two inches long, and that
one would think could ea&s;ily find &s;upport in any water, is yet obliged to
colonize, and leave its native fens in &s;earch of new habitations. Once every
&s;eventh or eighth year, amazing &s;hoals of the&s;e appear in the river
Welland, near Spalding, and come up the &s;tream, forming one great column.
They are &s;uppo&s;ed to be multitudes collected in &s;ome of the fens, till
overcharged with numbers, they are periodically obliged to migrate. An idea may
be had of their numbers, when we are informed, that a man, employed by a farmer
to take them, for the purpo&s;e of manuring his grounds, has got, for a
con&s;iderable time, four &s;hillings a day, by &s;elling them at a halfpenny a
bu&s;hel!</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee the amazing propagation of <PB N="335" REF="345"> fi&s;hes along our own coa&s;ts and rivers; but their numbers bear
no proportion to the va&s;t quan|tities found among the i&s;lands of the Indian
ocean. The inhabitants of the&s;e countries are not under the nece&s;&s;ity
even of providing in|&s;truments for fi&s;hing; it is but going down to the
&s;hore, and there the fi&s;h are found in great numbers in the pla&s;hes that
&s;till continue to have water in them. In &s;ome of the&s;e places the
quantity is &s;o great, that they are le&s;t in &s;hoals, on tho&s;e &s;wamps,
dried up by the &s;un, and their putrefaction contributes to render the country
unhealthful.</P>
<P>This power of encrea&s;ing in the&s;e animals, exceeds our
idea, as it would, in a very &s;hort time, out&s;trip all calculation. A
&s;ingle her|ring, if &s;uffered to multiply unmole&s;ted and undimini&s;hed
for twenty years, would &s;hew a progeny greater in bulk than ten &s;uch globes
as that we live upon. But happily the balance of nature is exactly pre&s;erved;
and their con|&s;umption is equal to their fecundity. For this rea&s;on we are
to con&s;ider the porpe&s;s, the &s;hark, or the cod-fi&s;h, not in the light
of plunderers and rivals, but of benefactors to mankind. Without their
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the &s;ea would &s;oon become overcharged with the burthen of
its own productions; and that element, which at <PB N="336" REF="346">
pre&s;ent di&s;tributes health and plenty to the &s;hore, would but load it
with putrefaction.</P>
<P>In the propagation of all fi&s;h &s;ome degree of warmth
&s;eems ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, not only to their pre&s;ervation, but to
the advancement of their po&s;terity. Their &s;pawn is always depo&s;ited in
tho&s;e places where the &s;un-beams may reach them, either at the bottom of
&s;hallow &s;hores, or floating on the &s;urface in deeper waters. A &s;mall
degree of heat an&s;wers all the purpo&s;es of incubation, and the animal
i&s;&s;ues from the egg in its &s;tate of perfect formation, never to undergo
any &s;ucceeding change.</P>
<P>Yet &s;till, I have &s;ome doubts whether mo&s;t fi&s;h come
from the egg completely formed. We know that in all the frog tribe, and many of
the lizard kind, they are produced from the egg in an imperfect form. The
tadpole, or young frog, with its enormous head and &s;lender tail, are well
known; a &s;pecies of the lizard al&s;o, which is excluded from the &s;hell
without legs, only acquires them by degrees, and not till after &s;ome time
does it put off its &s;erpent form. It is probable that &s;ome kinds of fi&s;h
in like manner &s;uffer a change; and though it be too incon&s;iderable to
&s;trike the fi&s;herman or the in|attentive &s;pectator, yet it makes a very
material difference to the naturali&s;t, and would perhaps 
<PB N="337" REF="347"> di&s;arrange his mo&s;t favourite &s;y&s;tems. A
&s;light alteration in the fins or bones that cover the gills would overturn
the whole fabric of the mo&s;t applauded ichthyologi&s;t; and yet, as I
ob&s;erved, it is mo&s;t probable that the&s;e minute alterations often take
place.</P>
<P>As a proof of this, during the month of July, there appear
near Greenwich innumerable &s;hoals of &s;mall fi&s;hes, which are known to the
Lon|doners by the name of White Bait. It is uni|ver&s;ally agreed that they are
the young of &s;ome fi&s;h; they are never &s;een but at this time of the year,
and never found to have any roe, a circum&s;tance that proves their not being
come to maturity. The quantity is amazing; and the fi&s;h that produces them in
&s;uch numbers mu&s;t be in plenty, though it is not yet known what that fi&s;h
is, as they corre&s;pond with no other &s;pecies whatever. They mo&s;t
re&s;emble the &s;melt in form; and yet they want a fin, which that animal is
never without. They cannot be the bleak, as they are never found in other
rivers where the bleak breed in great abundance. It is mo&s;t probable,
therefore, that they are the young of &s;ome animal not yet come to their
perfect form, and therefore re|ducible to no pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>The time that &s;pinous fi&s;hes continue in the 
<PB N="338" REF="348"> pea is in proportion to the &s;ize of the kind. It is a
rule that chiefly holds through nature, that the larger the animals are, the
longer they continue before exclu&s;ion. This I &s;ay holds generally through
all nature; though it is not ea&s;y to a&s;&s;ign a cau&s;e for &s;o well known
a truth. It may probably be, that as all large bodies take a longer time to
grow hot than &s;mall ones, &s;o the larger the egg, the longer influ|ence of
vital warmth it requires to reach through all its rece&s;&s;es, and to unfold
the dor|mant &s;prings that wait to be put into motion.</P>
<P>The manner in which the eggs of fi&s;hes are impregnated is
wholly unknown. All that ob|viou&s;ly offers is, that in ponds the &s;exes are
often &s;een together among the long gra&s;s at the edge of the water; that
there they &s;eem to &s;truggle; and that during this time they are in a
&s;tate of &s;uffering; they grow thin; they lo&s;e their appetite, and their
fle&s;h becomes flabby; the &s;cales of &s;ome grow rough, and they lo&s;e
their lu&s;tre. On the contrary, when the time of coupling is over, their
appetite returns; they re-a&s;&s;ume their natural agility, and their &s;cales
become brilliant and beautiful.</P>
<P>Although the u&s;ual way with &s;pinous fi&s;hes is to produce
by &s;pawn; yet there are &s;ome, &s;uch as the cel and the blenny, that are
known to bring forth their young alive. Bowlker, who <PB N="339" REF="349"> has
written a treati&s;e upon fi&s;hing, &s;eems to determine the que&s;tion
relative to the viviparous production of eels, upon the authority of one or two
credible witne&s;&s;es. An eel, opened in the pre&s;ence of &s;everal per&s;ons
of credit, was found to have an infinite number of little crea|tures, clo&s;ely
wrapped up together in a lump, about the &s;ize of a nutmeg, which being put
into a ba&s;on of water, &s;oon &s;eparated, and &s;wam about: yet &s;till,
whether the&s;e may not have been worms generated in the animal's body, remains
a doubt; for there are &s;carce any fi&s;hes that are not infe&s;ted with worms
in that man|ner.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the growth of fi&s;hes, it is ob|&s;erved,
that among carps, particularly the fir&s;t year, they grow to about the &s;ize
of the leaf of a willow-tree; at two years, they are about four inches long.
They grow but one inch more the third &s;ea&s;on, which is five inches. Tho&s;e
of four years old are about &s;ix inches; and &s;even after the fifth. From
that to eight years old they are found to be large in pro|portion to the
goodne&s;s of the pond, from eight to twelve inches. With regard to
&s;ea-fi&s;h, the fi&s;hermen a&s;&s;ure us that a fi&s;h mu&s;t be &s;ix years
old before it is fit to be &s;erved up to table. They in&s;tance it in the
growth of a mackarel. <PB N="340" REF="350"> They a&s;&s;ure us that tho&s;e a
year old are as large as one's finger; that tho&s;e of two years, are about
twice that length; at three and four years, they are that &s;mall kind of
mackarel that have neither melts nor rows; and between five and &s;ix, they are
tho&s;e full grown fi&s;h that are &s;erved up to our tables. In the &s;ame
manner, with regard to flat fi&s;hes, they tell us that the turbot and barble
at one year are about the &s;ize of a crown piece; the &s;econd year as large
as the palm of one's hand; and at the fifth and &s;ixth year, they are large
enough to be &s;erved up to table. Thus it appears that fi&s;h are a
con&s;iderable time in coming to their full growth, and that they are a
long-time de&s;troyed before it comes to their turn to be de&s;troyers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Trait&eacute; des P&ecirc;che par Mon&s;ieur Duhamel.

<P>All fi&s;h live upon each other, in &s;ome &s;tate of their
exi&s;tence. Tho&s;e with the large&s;t mouths, attack and devour the larger
kinds; tho&s;e who&s;e mouths are le&s;s, lie in wait for the &s;maller fry;
and even the&s;e chiefly &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon &s;pawn. Of tho&s;e which live in
the ocean of the &s;pinous kinds, the Dorado is the mo&s;t voracious. This is
chiefly found in the tropical climates; and is at once the mo&s;t active, and
the mo&s;t beautiful of the <PB REF="351">

</FIGURE> <PB N="341" REF="352"> finny region. It is about
&s;ix feet long; the back all over enamelled with &s;pots of a blui&s;h green
and &s;ilver; the tail and fins of a gold colour; and all have a brilliancy of
tint, that nothing but Nature's pencil can attain to: the eyes are placed on
each &s;ide of the head, large and beautiful, &s;urrounded with circles of
&s;hining gold. In the &s;eas where they are found, the&s;e fi&s;h are always
in motion, and playround &s;hips in full &s;ail, with ea&s;e and &s;ecurity:
for ever either pur&s;uing or pur&s;ued, they are &s;een continually in a
&s;tate of warfare; either defending them|&s;elves again&s;t the &s;hark, or
darting after the &s;maller fi&s;hes. Of all others, the Flying-fi&s;h mo&s;t
abounds in the&s;e &s;eas; and as it is a &s;mall animal, &s;eldom growing
above the &s;ize of a herring, it is chiefly &s;ought by the dorado. Nature has
furni&s;hed each re&s;pectively with the powers of pur&s;uit and eva&s;ion. The
dorado being above &s;ix feet long, yet not thicker than a &s;almon, and
furni&s;hed with a full complement of fins, cuts its way through the water with
amazing rapidity: on the other hand, the flying-fi&s;h is furni&s;hed with two
pair of fins longer than the body, and the&s;e al&s;o moved by a &s;tronger
&s;et of mu&s;cles than any other. This equality of power &s;eems to furni&s;h
one of the mo&s;t entertaining &s;pectacles tho&s;e &s;eas can 
<PB N="342" REF="353"> exhibit. The efforts to &s;eize on the one &s;ide, and
the arts of e&s;caping on the other, are perfectly amu&s;ing. The dorado is
&s;een, upon this occa|&s;ion, darting after its prey, which will not leave the
water, while it has the advantage of &s;wim|ming, in the beginning of the
chace. But, like an hunted hare, being tired at la&s;t, it then has recour&s;e
to another expedient for &s;afety, by flight. The long fins, which began to
grow u&s;ele&s;s in the water, are now exerted in a dif|ferent manner and
different direction to that in which they were employed in &s;wimming: by this
means the timid little animal ri&s;es from the water, and flutters over its
&s;urface, for two or three hundred yards, till the mu&s;cles employed in
moving the wings, are enfeebled by that particular manner of exertion. By this
time, however, they have acquired a fre&s;h power of renewing their efforts in
the water, and the animal is capable of proceeding with &s;ome velo|city by
&s;wimming: &s;till, however, the active enemy keeps it in view, and drives it
again from the deep; till, at length, the poor little creature is &s;een to
dart to &s;horter di&s;tances, to flutter with greater effort, and to drop down
at la&s;t into the mouth of its fierce pur&s;uer. But not the dorado alone, all
animated nature &s;eems combined again&s;t this little fi&s;h, which 
<PB N="343" REF="354"> &s;eems po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of double powers, only to be
&s;ubject to greater dangers. For though it &s;hould e&s;cape from its enemies
of the deep, yet the tropic bird and the albatro&s;s are for ever upon the wing
to &s;eize it. Thus pur&s;ued in either element, it &s;ometimes &s;eeks refuge
from a new enemy; and it is not unfrequent for whole &s;hoals of them to fall
on &s;hip-board, where they furni&s;h man with an object of u&s;ele&s;s
curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>The warfare in fre&s;h-water is not carried on with &s;uch
de&s;tructive activity; nor are the in|habitants of that element &s;o numerous.
It would &s;eem that there is &s;omething more fa|vourable to the fecundity of
fi&s;hes in the ocean, than in an element le&s;s impregnated with &s;alt. It
has been the opinion of &s;ome philo|&s;ophers, that all fi&s;h are natives of
that great re&s;ervoir; and that only colonies have been &s;ent up rivers,
either through accident, or the nece&s;&s;ity of procuring &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.
They have been led to this opinion by the &s;uperior fe|cundity of &s;ea
fi&s;h, which breed twenty to one; as well as by their &s;uperiority in
&s;trength and &s;ize, over tho&s;e of the &s;ame kind found in lakes and
rivers. This is a matter too remotely &s;pe|culative to be worth pur&s;uing;
but certain it is, that, in fre&s;h water, fi&s;hes &s;eem to abate much of
their courage and rapacity; pur&s;ue <PB N="344" REF="355"> each other with
le&s;s violence, and &s;eem to be le&s;s powerfully actuated by all their
appetites. The greedine&s;s with which &s;ea-fi&s;h devour the bait is
prodigious, if compared with the manner they take it in fre&s;h water. The
lines of &s;uch fi&s;hermen as go off to &s;ea, are coar&s;e, thick and
clum&s;y, compared to what are u&s;ed by tho&s;e who fi&s;h at land. Their
baits are &s;eldom more than a piece of a fi&s;h, or the fle&s;h of &s;ome
qua|drupede, &s;tuck on the hook in a bungling manner; and &s;carce any art is
employed to conceal the deception. But it is otherwi&s;e in fre&s;h water; the
lines mu&s;t often be drawn to an hair-like finene&s;s; they mu&s;t be
tinctured of the peculiar colour of the &s;tream; the bait mu&s;t be formed
with the nice&s;t art, and even, if po&s;|&s;ible, to exceed the perfection of
nature: yet &s;till the fi&s;hes approach it with diffidence, and often &s;wim
round it with di&s;dain. The cod, on the banks of Newfoundland, the in&s;tant
the hook, which is only baited with the guts of the animal la&s;t taken, is
dropped into the water, darts to it at once, and the fi&s;hermen have but to
pull up as fa&s;t as they throw down. But it is otherwi&s;e with tho&s;e who
fi&s;h in fre&s;h waters, they mu&s;t wait whole hours in fruitle&s;s
expec|tation; and <HI>the patience of a fi&s;herman</HI> is proverbial among
us.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="356">This comparative neglect of food, which
is found in all the tribes of fre&s;h water fi&s;hes, renders them le&s;s
turbulent and le&s;s de&s;tructive among each other. Of all the&s;e the pike is
the mo&s;t active and voracious; and our poets, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to
ob&s;erve the &s;urface of nature, have called it the tyrant of the watery
plain. In fact, in proportion to its &s;trength and celerity, the pike does
&s;ome mi&s;chief; but what are its efforts, compared to tho&s;e of the
cachalot or the &s;hark! they re&s;emble the petty depredations of a robber,
put in competition with the ravages of a conqueror! However, the pike will
attack every fi&s;h le&s;s than it&s;elf; and it is &s;ometimes &s;een choaked,
by attempting to &s;wallow &s;uch as are too large a mor&s;el. It is immaterial
of what &s;pecies the animal it pur&s;ues appears to be, whether of another or
its own; all are in|di&s;criminately devoured; &s;o that every fi&s;h owes its
&s;afety to its minutene&s;s, its celerity, or its courage: nor does the pike
confine it&s;elf to feed on fi&s;h and frogs; it will draw down the water-rat
and the young ducks, as they are &s;wimming about. Ge&s;ner tells us of a mule
that &s;tooped to drink in the water, when a fami&s;hed pike, that was near,
&s;eized it by the no&s;e, nor was it di&s;engaged till the bea&s;t flung it on
&s;hore. So great is their rapacity, that <PB N="346" REF="357"> they will
contend with the otter for his prey, and even endeavour to force it from him.
For this rea&s;on it is dreaded by all other fi&s;h; and the &s;mall ones
&s;hew the &s;ame unea&s;ine&s;s and dete&s;tation at the pre&s;ence of their
tyrant, as the little birds do at the &s;ight of an hawk or an owl. When the
pike lies a&s;leep near the &s;ur|face, as is frequently the ca&s;e, the
le&s;&s;er fi&s;h are often ob&s;erved to &s;wim around it in va&s;t numbers,
with a mixture of caution and terror.</P>
<P>The other tribes of fre&s;h water fi&s;h are much inferior to
this animal in courage and rapacity: they chiefly &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon worms and
in&s;ects, pur&s;uing them at the bottom, or jumping after them to the
&s;urface of the water. In winter al&s;o, their appetite &s;eems entirely to
for&s;ake them; at lea&s;t they continue in &s;o torpid a &s;tate, that few
baits will tempt them to their de&s;truc|tion. At that &s;ea&s;on, they
for&s;ake the &s;hallow waters, and &s;eek tho&s;e deep holes to be found in
every river, where they continue for days to|gether, without ever appearing to
move. The cold &s;eems to affect them; for at that time they lie clo&s;e to the
bottom, where the water is mo&s;t warm, and &s;eldom venture out except the day
be peculiarly fine, and the &s;hallows at the edges of the &s;tream become
tepified by the powerful rays of the &s;un. Indeed, I have been a&s;&s;ured,
that <PB N="347" REF="358"> &s;ome fi&s;hes may be rendered &s;o torpid by the
cold, in the northern rivers, as to be frozen up, in the great ma&s;&s;es of
ice, in which they con|tinue for &s;everal months together, &s;eemingly without
life or &s;en&s;ation, the pri&s;oners of con|gelation, and waiting the
approach of a warmer &s;un, to re&s;tore them at once to life and liberty. Thus
that chearful luminary not only di&s;tributes health and vegetation to the
productions of the earth, but is ardently &s;ought even by the gelid
inhabitants of the water.</P>
<P>As fi&s;h are enemies one to another, &s;o each &s;pecies is
infe&s;ted with worms of different kinds, peculiar to it&s;elf. The great
fi&s;h abound with them; and the little ones are not entirely free. The&s;e
trouble&s;ome vermin lodge them&s;elves either in the jaws, and the
inte&s;tines internally, or near the fins without. When fi&s;h are healthy and
fat, they are not much annoyed by them; but in winter, when they are lean or
&s;ickly, they then &s;uffer very much.</P>
<P>Nor does the reputed longevity of this cla&s;s &s;ecure them
from their peculiar di&s;or|ders. They are not only affected by too much cold,
but there are frequently certain di&s;po&s;i|tions of the element in which they
re&s;ide, un|favourable to their health and propagation. Some ponds they will
not breed in, however <PB N="348" REF="359"> artfully di&s;po&s;ed for
&s;upplying them with fre&s;h recruits of water, as well as provi&s;ion. In
&s;ome &s;ea&s;ons they are found to feel epidemic di&s;orders, and are &s;een
dead by the water-&s;ide, without any apparent cau&s;e: yet &s;till they are
animals of all others the mo&s;t vivacious, and they often live and
&s;ub&s;i&s;t upon &s;uch &s;ub&s;tances as are poi|&s;onous to the more
perfect cla&s;&s;es of animated nature.</P>
<P>It is not ea&s;y to determine whether the poi|&s;onous
qualities which many of them are found to po&s;&s;e&s;s, either when they wound
our bodies externally with their &s;pines, or when they are unwarily eaten at
our tables, ari&s;es from this cau&s;e. That numbers of fi&s;hes inflict
poi&s;onous wounds, in the opinion of many, cannot be doubted. The concurrent
te&s;timony of man|kind, they think &s;ufficient to contradict any
rea|&s;onings upon this head, taken from anatomical in&s;pection. The great
pain that is felt from the &s;ting given by the back fin of the weever, bears
no proportion to the &s;mallne&s;s of the in&s;trument that inflicts the wound.
How the poi&s;on is pre&s;erved, or how it is conveyed by the animal, it is not
in our power to perceive; but its actual exi&s;tence has been often atte&s;ted
by painful experience. In this in&s;tance we mu&s;t decline conjecture,
&s;atisfied with hi&s;tory.</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="360">The fact of their being poi&s;onous when
eaten, is equally notorious; and the cau&s;e equally in|&s;crutable. My poor
worthy friend Dr. Grainger, who re&s;ided for many years at St.
Chri&s;topher's, a&s;&s;ured me, that of the fi&s;h caught, of the &s;ame kind,
at one end of the i&s;land, &s;ome were the be&s;t and mo&s;t whole&s;ome in
the world; while others taken at a different end, were always dan|gerous, and
mo&s;t commonly fatal. We have a paper in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions,
giving an account of the poi&s;onous qualities of tho&s;e found at New
Providence, one of the Bahama i&s;lands. The author there a&s;&s;ures us, that
the greate&s;t part of the fi&s;h of that dreary coa&s;t, are all of a deadly
nature: their &s;malle&s;t effects be|ing to bring on a terrible pain in the
joints, which, if terminating favourably, leaves the patient without any
appetite for &s;everal days after. It is not tho&s;e of the mo&s;t deformed
figure, or the mo&s;t frightful to look at, that are alone to be dreaded; all
kinds, at different times, are alike dangerous; and the &s;ame &s;pecies which
has this day &s;erved for nouri&s;hment, is the next, if tried, found to be
fatal!</P>
<P>This noxious quality has given ri&s;e to much &s;peculation,
and many conjectures. Some have &s;uppo&s;ed it to ari&s;e from the fi&s;hes on
the&s;e &s;hores eating of the machinel apple, a deadly <PB N="350" REF="361">
vegetable poi&s;on, that &s;ometimes grows pendent over the &s;ea: but the
quantity of tho&s;e trees, growing in this manner, bears no proportion to the
exten&s;ive infection of the fi&s;h. Labat has a&s;cribed it to their eating
the gally fi&s;h, which is it&s;elf mo&s;t potently poi&s;onous; but this only
removes our wonder a little farther back; for it may be a&s;ked, with as ju&s;t
a cau&s;e for curio|&s;ity, how comes the gally fi&s;h it&s;elf to procure its
noxious qualities? Others have a&s;cribed the poi&s;on of the&s;e fi&s;hes to
their feeding upon coperas beds: but I do not know of any cop|per mines found
in America. In &s;hort, as we cannot de&s;cribe the alembic by which the
rattle-&s;nake di&s;tils its malignity, nor the proce&s;s by which the
&s;corpion, that lives among ro&s;es, converts their &s;weets to venom, &s;o we
cannot di&s;cover the manner by which fi&s;hes become thus dangerous; and it is
well for us of Europe that we can thus wonder in &s;ecurity. It is cer|tain
that, with us, if fi&s;hes, &s;uch as carp or tench, acquire any di&s;agreeable
flavour from the lakes in which they have been bred, this can be removed, by
their being kept &s;ome time in finer and better water: there they &s;oon clear
away all tho&s;e di&s;agreeable qualities their fle&s;h had contracted, and
become as delicate as if they had been always fed in the mo&s;t cleanly 
<PB N="351" REF="362"> manner. But this expedient is with us rather the
precaution of luxury, than the effect of fear; we have nothing to dread from
the noxi|ous qualities of our fi&s;h; for all the animals our waters furni&s;h
are whole&s;ome.</P>
<P>Happy England! where the &s;ea furni&s;hes an abundant and
luxurious repa&s;t, and the fre&s;h waters an innocent and harmle&s;s
pa&s;time; where the angler, in chearful &s;olitude, &s;trolls by the edge of
the &s;tream, and fears neither the coiled &s;nake, nor the lurking crocodile;
where he can retire at night, with his few trouts, to borrow the pretty
de&s;cription of old Walton, to &s;ome friendly cottage, where the landlady is
good, and the daughter innocent and beautiful; where the room is cleanly, with
lavender in the &s;heets, and twenty ballads &s;tuck about the wall! There he
can enjoy the company of a talkative bro|ther &s;port&s;man, have his trouts
dre&s;&s;ed for &s;upper, tell tales, &s;ing old tunes, or make a catch! There
he can talk of the wonders of na|ture with learned admiration, or find &s;ome
harmle&s;s &s;port to content him, and pa&s;s away a little time, without
offence to God, or injury to man!</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of the Divi&s;ion of Shell Fi&s;h.</HEAD>
<P>IN de&s;cribing the inhabitants of the water, a cla&s;s of
animals occur, that mankind, from the place of their re&s;idence, have been
content to call fi&s;h; but that naturali&s;ts, from their for|mation, have
ju&s;tly agreed to be unworthy of the name. Indeed, the affinity many of this
kind bear to the in&s;ect tribe, may very well plead for the hi&s;torian who
ranks them rather as in&s;ects. However, the common language of a country
mu&s;t not be &s;lightly invaded; the names of things may remain, if the
philo&s;opher be careful to give preci&s;ion to our ideas of them.</P>
<P>There are two cla&s;&s;es of animals, therefore, in|habiting
the water, which commonly receive the name of fi&s;hes, entirely different from
tho&s;e we have been de&s;cribing, and al&s;o very di&s;tinct from each other.
The&s;e are divided by naturali&s;ts into Cru&s;taceous and Te&s;taceous
animals: both, totally unlike fi&s;hes to appearance, &s;eem to in|vert the
order of nature; and as tho&s;e have their bones on the in&s;ide, and their
mu&s;cles hung upon them for the purpo&s;es of life and motion, the&s;e, on the
contrary, have all their bony parts on <PB N="356" REF="365"> the out&s;ide,
and all their mu&s;cles within. Not to talk my&s;teriou&s;ly&mdash;all who have
&s;een a lob|&s;ter or an oy&s;ter, perceive that the &s;hell in the&s;e bears
a &s;trong analogy to the bones of other animals; and that, by the&s;e
&s;hells, the animal is &s;u&s;tained and defended.</P>
<P>Cru&s;taceous fi&s;h, &s;uch as the crab and the lob|&s;ter,
have a &s;hell not quite of a &s;tony hardne&s;s, but rather re&s;embling a
firm cru&s;t, and in &s;ome mea|&s;ure capable of yielding. Te&s;taceous
fi&s;hes, &s;uch as the oy&s;ter or cockle, are furni&s;hed with a &s;hell of a
&s;tony hardne&s;s; very brittle, and incapable of yielding. Of the
cru&s;taceous kinds are the Lob&s;ter, the Crab, and the Tortoi&s;e: of the
te&s;taceous, that numerous tribe of Oy&s;ters, Mu&s;cles, Cockles, and Sea
Snails, which offer with infinite variety.</P>
<P>The cru&s;taceous tribe &s;eem to hold the mid|dle rank
between fi&s;hes, properly &s;o called, and tho&s;e &s;nail like animals that
receive the name of te&s;taceous fi&s;hes. Their mu&s;cles are &s;trong and
firm, as in the former; their &s;hell is &s;elf-produced, as among the latter.
They have motion, and hunt for food with great avidity, like the former. They
are incapable of &s;wim|ming, but creep along the bottom, like the latter: in
&s;hort, they form the link that unites the&s;e two cla&s;&s;es, that &s;eem
&s;o very oppo&s;ite in their natures.</P>
<P><PB N="357" REF="366">Of te&s;taceous fi&s;hes we will &s;peak
hereafter. As to animals of the cru&s;taceous kind, they are very numerous,
their figure offers an hundred varieties: but as to their nature, they are
ob|viou&s;ly divided into two very di&s;tinct kinds, differing in their habits
and their conformation. The chief of one kind is the Lob&s;ter; the chief of
the other, the Tortoi&s;e. Under the Lob&s;ter we rank the Prawn, the Cray
Fi&s;h, the Shrimp, the Sea Crab, the Land Crab, and all their varieties. Under

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Cru&s;taceous Animals of the Lob&s;ter
Kind.</HEAD>
<P>HOWEVER different in figure the lob&s;ter and the crab may
&s;eem, their manners and con|formation are nearly the &s;ame. With all the
voracious appetites of fi&s;hes, they are con|demned to lead an in&s;ect life
at the bottom of the water; and though pre&s;&s;ed by continual hunger, they
are often obliged to wait till ac|cident brings them their prey. Though without
any warmth in their bodies, or even without red blood circulating through their
veins, they are animals wonderfully voracious. Whatever they &s;eize upon that
has life, is &s;ure to peri&s;h, though never &s;o well defended: they even
devour each other: and, to encrea&s;e our &s;urprize &s;till more, they may, in
&s;ome mea&s;ure, be &s;aid to eat them|&s;elves; as they change their &s;hell
and their &s;to|mach every year, and their old &s;tomach is ge|nerally the
fir&s;t mor&s;el that &s;erves to glut the new.</P>
<P>The lob&s;ter is an animal of &s;o extraordinary a form, that
tho&s;e who fir&s;t &s;ee it are apt to mi&s;take the head for the tail; but it
is &s;oon di&s;covered that the animal moves with its claws foremo&s;t; and
that the part which plays <PB N="359" REF="368"> within it&s;elf by joints,
like a coat of armour, is the tail. The two great claws are the lob&s;ter's
in&s;truments of provi&s;ion and defence; the&s;e, by opening like a pair of
nippers, have great &s;trength, and take a firm hold; they are u&s;ually
notched, like a &s;aw, which &s;till more encrea&s;es their tenacity. Be&s;ide
the&s;e powerful in&s;tru|ments, which may be con&s;idered as arms, the
lob&s;ter has eight legs, four on each &s;ide; and the&s;e, with the tail,
&s;erve to give the animal its progre&s;&s;ive and &s;ideling motion. Between
the two claws is the animal's head, very &s;mall, and furni&s;hed with eyes
that &s;eem like two black horny &s;pecks on each &s;ide; and the&s;e it has a
power of advancing out of the &s;ocket, and draw|ing in at plea&s;ure. The
mouth, like that of in&s;ects, opens the long way of the body; not
cro&s;&s;ways, as with man, and the higher race of animals. It is furni&s;hed
with two teeth for the comminu|tion of its food; but as the&s;e are not
&s;ufficient, it has three more in the &s;tomach; one on each &s;ide, and the
other below. Between the two teeth there is a fle&s;hy &s;ub&s;tance, in the
&s;hape of a tongue. The inte&s;tines con&s;i&s;t of one long bowel, which
reaches from the mouth to the vent; but what this animal differs in from all
others, is, that the &s;pinal marrow is in the brea&s;t-bone. It is furni&s;hed
with two long <PB N="360" REF="369"> feelers or horns, that i&s;&s;ue on each
&s;ide of the head, that &s;eem to correct the dimne&s;s of its &s;ight, and
apprize the animal of its danger, or of its prey. The tail, or that jointed
in&s;trument at the other end, is the grand in&s;trument of motion; and with
this it can rai&s;e it&s;elf in the water. Under this we u&s;ually &s;ee lodged
the &s;pawn in great abundance; every pea adhering to the next by a very fine
filament, which is &s;carcely perceivable. Every lob&s;ter is an
her|maphrodite, and is &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;elf-im|pregnated! The ovary, or
place where the &s;pawn is fir&s;t produced, is backwards, toward the tail,
where a red &s;ub&s;tance is always found, and which is nothing but a clu&s;ter
of peas, that are yet too &s;mall for exclu&s;ion. From this receptacle there
go two canals, that open on each &s;ide at the jointures of the &s;hell, at the
belly; and through the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages the peas de|&s;cend to be excluded, and
placed under the tail, where the animal pre&s;erves them from danger for &s;ome
time, until they come to maturity; when, being furni&s;hed with limbs and
motion, they drop off into the water.</P>
<P>When the young lob&s;ters leave the parent, they immediately
&s;eek for refuge in the &s;malle&s;t clefts of rocks, and in &s;uch like
crevices at the bottom of the &s;ea, where the entrance is but &s;mall, and the
opening can be ea&s;ily defended. <PB N="361" REF="370"> There, without
&s;eeming to take any food, they grow larger in a few weeks time, from the mere
accidental &s;ub&s;tances which the water wa&s;hes to their retreats. By this
time al&s;o they acquire an hard, firm &s;hell, which furni&s;hes them with
both offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive armour. They then begin to i&s;&s;ue from
their fortre&s;&s;es, and boldly creep along the bottom, in hopes of meeting
with more diminutive plunder. The &s;pawn of fi&s;h, the &s;maller animals of
their own kind, but chiefly the worms that keep at the bottom of the &s;ea,
&s;upply them with plenty. They keep in this manner clo&s;e among the rocks,
bu&s;ily employed in &s;cratching up the &s;and with their claws for worms, or
&s;urprizing &s;uch heedle&s;s animals as fall within their gra&s;p: thus they
have little to apprehend, except from each other; for in them, as among
fi&s;hes, the large are the mo&s;t formidable of all other enemies to the
&s;mall.</P>
<P>But this life of abundance and &s;ecurity is &s;oon to have a
mo&s;t dangerous interruption; for the body of the lob&s;ter &s;till continuing
to encrea&s;e, while its &s;hell remains inalterably the &s;ame, the animal
becomes too large for its habitation, and impri&s;oned within the cru&s;t that
has na|turally gathered round it, there comes on a nece&s;&s;ity of getting
free. The young of this <PB N="362" REF="371"> kind, therefore, that grow
fa&s;ter, as I am a&s;|&s;ured by the fi&s;hermen, change their &s;hell oftener
than the old, who come to their full growth, and who remain in the &s;ame
&s;hell often for two years together. In general, however, all the&s;e animals
change their &s;hell once a year; and this is not only a mo&s;t painful
operation, but al&s;o &s;ubjects them to every danger. Their molting &s;ea&s;on
is generally about the begin|ning of &s;ummer; at which time their food is in
plenty, and their &s;trength and vigour in the highe&s;t perfection. But &s;oon
all their ac|tivity cea&s;es: they are &s;een for&s;aking the open parts of the
deep, and &s;eeking &s;ome retired &s;ituation among the rocks, or &s;ome
outlet where they may remain in &s;afety from the attacks of their various
enemies. For &s;ome days before their change, the animal di&s;continues its
u&s;ual voraciou&s;ne&s;s; it is no longer &s;een laboriou&s;ly harrowing up
the &s;and at the bottom, or fight|ing with others of its kind, or hunting its
prey; it lies torpid and motionle&s;s, as if in anxious expectation of the
approaching change. Ju&s;t before ca&s;ting its &s;hell, it throws it&s;elf
upon its back, &s;trikes its claws again&s;t each other, and every limb &s;eems
to tremble; its feelers are agitated, and the whole body is in violent mo|tion:
it then &s;wells it&s;elf in an unu&s;ual manner, <PB N="363" REF="372"> and at
la&s;t the &s;hell is &s;een beginning to divide at its junctures; particularly
it opens at the junctures of the belly, where, like a pair of jumps, it was
before but &s;eemingly united. It al&s;o &s;eems turned in&s;ide out; and its
&s;tomach comes away with its &s;hell. After this, by the &s;ame operation, it
di&s;engages it&s;elf of the claws, which bur&s;t at the joints; the animal,
with a tremulous motion, ca&s;ting them off as a man would kick off a boot that
was too big for him.</P>
<P>Thus, in a &s;hort time, this wonderful creature finds
it&s;elf at liberty; but in &s;o weak and en|feebled a &s;tate, that it
continues for &s;everal hours motionle&s;s. Indeed, &s;o violent and pain|ful
is the operation, that many of them die under it; and tho&s;e which &s;urvive,
are in &s;uch a weakly &s;tate for &s;ome time, that they neither take food,
nor venture from their retreats. Im|mediately after this change, they have not
only the &s;oftne&s;s, but the timidity of a worm. Every animal of the deep is
then a powerful enemy, which they can neither e&s;cape nor oppo&s;e; and this,
in fact, is the time when the dog-fi&s;h, the cod, and the ray, devour them by
hundreds. But this &s;tate of defencele&s;s imbecillity continues for a very
&s;hort time: the animal, in le&s;s than two days, is &s;een to have the &s;kin
that covered <PB N="364" REF="373"> its body grown almo&s;t as hard as before;
its appetite is &s;een to encrea&s;e; and, &s;trange to be|hold! the fir&s;t
object that tempts its gluttony, is its own &s;tomach, which it &s;o lately was
di&s;|engaged from. This it devours with great eager|ne&s;s; and &s;ome time
after eats even its former &s;hell. In about forty-eight hours, in proportion
to the animal's health and &s;trength, the new &s;hell is perfectly formed, and
as hard as that which was but ju&s;t thrown a&s;ide.</P>
<P>To contribute to the &s;peedy growth of the &s;hell, it is
&s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome, that the lob&s;ter is &s;upplied with a very
extraordinary concretion within its body, that is converted into the &s;helly
&s;ub&s;tance. It is a chalky &s;ub&s;tance, found in the lower part of the
&s;tomach of all lob&s;ters, improperly called crab's eyes, and &s;old under
that title in the &s;hops. About the time the lob&s;ter quits its &s;hell, the
teeth in its &s;tomach break the&s;e &s;tones to pieces, and the fluids
con|tained therein di&s;&s;olve them. This fluid, which &s;till remains in the
new &s;tomach, is thought to be replete with a petrifying quality, proper for
forming a new &s;hell: however, the concreting power that fir&s;t formed
the&s;e, &s;hews a &s;ufficient power in the animal to produce al&s;o the
&s;hell; and it is going but a &s;hort way in the cau&s;es of things, when we
attempt to explain one wonder by another.</P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="374">When the lob&s;ter is compleatly
equipped in its new &s;hell, it then appears how much it has grown in the
&s;pace of a very few days; the di|men&s;ions of the old &s;hell being compared
with tho&s;e of the new, it will be found that the creature is encrea&s;ed
above a third in its &s;ize; and, like a boy that has outgrown his cloaths, it
&s;eems wonderful how the de&s;erted &s;hell was able to contain &s;o great an
animal as entirely fills up the new.</P>
<P>The creature thus furni&s;hed, not only with a complete
covering, but al&s;o a greater &s;hare of &s;trength and courage, ventures more
boldly among the animals at bottom; and not a week pa&s;&s;es that in its
combats it does not &s;uffer &s;ome mutilation. A joint, or even a whole claw,
is &s;ometimes &s;napped off in the&s;e en|counters. At certain &s;ea&s;ons of
the year the&s;e animals never meet each other without an en|gagement. In
the&s;e, to come off with the lo&s;s of a leg, or even a claw, is con&s;idered
as no great calamity; the victor carries off the &s;poil to fea&s;t upon at his
lei&s;ure, while the other re|tires from the defeat to wait for a thorough
re|pair. This repair is not long in procuring. From the place where the joint
of the claw was cut away, is &s;een in a mo&s;t &s;urprizing manner to burgeon
out the beginning of a new claw. <PB N="366" REF="375"> This, if ob&s;erved, at
fir&s;t, is &s;mall and tender, but grows, in the &s;pace of three weeks, to be
al|mo&s;t as large and as powerful as the old one. I &s;ay almo&s;t as large,
for it never arrives to the full &s;ize; and this is the rea&s;on we generally
find the claws of the lob&s;ters of unequal magnitude.</P>
<P>After what has been thus de&s;cribed, let us pau&s;e a little,
to reflect on the wonders this extra|ordinary creature offers to our
imagination! An animal without bones on the in&s;ide, yet furni&s;hed with a
&s;tomach capable of dige&s;ting the harde&s;t &s;ub&s;tances, the &s;hells of
mu&s;cles, of oy&s;ters, and even its own; an animal gaining a new &s;to|mach
and a new &s;hell at &s;tated intervals! Fur|ni&s;hed with the in&s;truments of
generation double in both &s;exes; and yet with an apparent inca|pacity of
uniting! Without red blood circu|lating through the body, and yet apparently
vigorous and active! But mo&s;t &s;trange of all, an animal endowed with a
vital principle that furni&s;hes out &s;uch limbs as have been cut away; and
keeps continually combating it, though in con&s;tant repair to renew its
engagements!&mdash;The&s;e are but a &s;mall part of the wonders of the deep,
where Nature &s;ports without a &s;pectator!</P>
<P>Of this extraordinary yet well known animal there are many
varieties, with &s;ome differences <PB REF="376">

the habits or confor|mation. It is found above three feet long; and if we may
admit the &s;hrimp and the prawn into the cla&s;s, though unfurni&s;hed with
claws, it is &s;een not above an inch. The&s;e all live in the water, and can
bear its ab&s;ence for but a few hours. The &s;hell is black when taken out of
the water, but turns red by boiling. The mo&s;t common way of taking the
lob&s;ter is in a ba&s;ket, or pot, as the fi&s;hermen call it, made of
wicker-work, in which they put the bait, and then throw it to the bottom of the
&s;ea, in &s;ix or ten fathom water. The lob&s;ters creep into this for the
&s;ake of the bait, but are not able to get out again. The river craw-fi&s;h
differs little from the lob&s;ter, but that the one will live only in fre&s;h
water, and the other will thrive only in the &s;ea.</P>
<P>The crab is an animal found equally in fre&s;h and &s;alt
water; as well upon land as in the ocean. In &s;hape it differs very much from
the lob&s;ter, but entirely re&s;embles it in habits and conformation. The tail
in this ani|mal is not &s;o apparent as in the former, being that broad flap
that &s;eems to cover a part of the belly, and when lifted di&s;covers the peas
or &s;pawn, &s;ituated there in great abundance. It re&s;embles the lob&s;ter
in the number of its claws, which are two; and its legs, which are eight, 
<PB N="368" REF="378"> four on either &s;ide. Like the lob&s;ter, it is a bold
voracious animal; and &s;uch an enmity do crabs bear each other, that tho&s;e
who carry them for &s;ale to market, often tie their claws with &s;trings to
prevent their fighting and maiming them&s;elves by the way. In &s;hort, it
re&s;embles the lob&s;ter in every thing but the amazing bulk of its body
compared to the &s;ize of its head, and the length of its inte&s;tines, which
have many convolutions.</P>
<P>As the crab, however, is found upon land as well as in the
water, the peculiarity of its &s;ituation produces a difference in its
habi|tudes, which it is proper to de&s;cribe. The Land Crab is found in &s;ome
of the warmer re|gions of Europe, and in great abundance in all the tropical
cimates in Africa and America. They are of various kinds, and endued with
various properties; &s;ome being healthful, de|licious, and nouri&s;hing food;
others, poi&s;onous or malignant to the la&s;t degree; &s;ome are not above
half an inch broad, others are found a foot over; &s;ome are of a dirty brown,
and others beautifully mottled. That animal called the Violet Crab of the
Caribbee I&s;lands, is the mo&s;t noted both for its &s;hape, the delicacy of
its fle&s;h, and the &s;ingularity of its manners.</P>
<P>The violet crab &s;omewhat re&s;embles two hands cut through
the middle and joined to|gether; <PB N="369" REF="379"> for each &s;ide looks
like four fingers, and the two nippers or claws re&s;emble the thumbs. All the
re&s;t of the body is covered with a &s;hell as large as a man's hand and
bunched in the middle, on the fore-part of which there are two long eyes of the
&s;ize of a grain of barley, as tran&s;parent as chry&s;tal and as hard as
horn. A little below the&s;e is the mouth, covered with a &s;ort of barbs,
under which there are two broad &s;harp teeth as white as &s;now. They are not
placed, as in other ani|mals, cro&s;s-ways, but in the oppo&s;ite direction,
not much unlike the blades of a pair of &s;ci&s;&s;ars. With the&s;e teeth they
can ea&s;ily cut leaves, fruits, and rotten wood, which is their u&s;ual food.
But their principal in&s;trument for cut|ting and &s;eizing their food is their
nippers, which catch &s;uch an hold, that the animal lo&s;es the limb &s;ooner
than its gra&s;p, and is often &s;een &s;campering off, having left its claw
&s;till holding fa&s;t upon the enemy. The faithful claw &s;eems to perform its
duty, and keeps for above a mi|nute fa&s;tened upon the finger while the crab
is making off<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Brown Jamaic. 423.</BIBL></NOTE>.
In fact it lo&s;es no great matter by leaving a leg or an arm, for they &s;oon
grow again, and the animal is found as perfect as before.</P>
<P>This, however, is the lea&s;t &s;urprizing part of 
<PB N="370" REF="380"> this creature's hi&s;tory: and what I am going to
relate, were it not as well known and as con|fidently confirmed as any other
circum&s;tance in natural hi&s;tory, it might well &s;tagger our belief.
The&s;e animals live not only in a kind of or|derly &s;ociety in their retreats
in the mountains, but regularly once a year march down to the &s;ea-&s;ide in a
body of &s;ome millions at a time. As they multiply in great numbers, they
chu&s;e the months of April or May to begin their ex|pedition; and then &s;ally
out by thou&s;ands from the &s;tumps of hollow trees, from the clefts of rocks,
and from the holes which they dig for them&s;elves under the &s;urface of the
earth. At that time the whole ground is covered with this band of adventurers;
there is no &s;etting down one's foot without treading upon them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Labat. Voyage aux I&s;le Francoi&s;e, vol. ii. p.
221.</BIBL></NOTE>. The &s;ea is their place of de&s;tination, and to that they
direct their march with right-lined preci&s;ion. No geometrician could &s;end
them to their de|&s;tined &s;tation by a &s;horter cour&s;e; they neither turn
to the right or left, whatever ob&s;tacles intervene; and even if they meet
with a hou&s;e, they will attempt to &s;cale the walls to keep the unbroken
tenor of their way. But though this be the general order of their route, they
upon other occa&s;ions are compelled to conform to <PB N="371" REF="381"> the
face of the country; and if it be inter&s;ected by rivers, they are then &s;een
to wind along the cour&s;e of the &s;tream. The proce&s;&s;ion &s;ets for|ward
from the mountains with the regularity of an army under the guidance of an
experienced commander. They are commonly divided into three battalions; of
which, the fir&s;t con&s;i&s;ts of the &s;tronge&s;t and bolde&s;t males, that,
like pioneers, march forward to clear the route and face the greate&s;t
dangers. The&s;e are often obliged to halt for want of rain, and go into the
mo&s;t convenient encampment till the weather changes. The main body of the
army is com|po&s;ed of females, which never leave the moun|tains till the rain
is &s;et in for &s;ome time, and then de&s;cend in regular battalia, being
formed into columns of fifty paces broad and three miles deep, and &s;o clo&s;e
that they almo&s;t cover the ground. Three or four days after this the
rear-guard follows; a &s;traggling undi&s;ciplined tribe, con&s;i&s;ting of
males and females, but neither &s;o robu&s;t nor &s;o numerous as the former.
The night is their chief time of proceeding; but if it rains by day, they do
not fail to profit by the occa&s;ion; and they continue to move forward in
their &s;low uniform manner. When the &s;un &s;hines and is hot upon the
&s;urface of the ground, they then make an univer&s;al halt, and 
<PB N="372" REF="382"> wait till the cool of the evening. When they are
terrified, they march back in a confu&s;ed di&s;orderly manner, holding up
their nippers, with which they &s;ometimes tear off a piece of the &s;kin, and
then leave the weapon where they inflicted the wound. They even try to
intimidate their enemies; for they often clatter their nippers together, as if
it were to threaten tho&s;e that come to di&s;turb them. But though they thus
&s;trive to be formidable to man, they are much more &s;o to each other; for
they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of one mo&s;t un&s;ocial property, which is, that if
any of them by accident is maimed in &s;uch a manner as to be incapable of
proceed|ing, the re&s;t fall upon and devour it on the &s;pot, and then
pur&s;ue their journey.</P>
<P>When after a fatiguing march and e&s;caping a thou&s;and
dangers, for they are &s;ometimes three months in getting to the &s;hore, they
have arrived at their de&s;tined port, they prepare to ca&s;t their &s;pawn.
The peas are as yet within their bodies, and not excluded, as is u&s;ual in
animals of this kind, under the tail; for the creature waits for the benefit of
the &s;ea-water to help the delivery. For this purpo&s;e, the crab has no
&s;ooner reached the &s;hore, than it eagerly goes to the edge of the water,
and lets the waves wa&s;h over its body two or three <PB N="373" REF="383">
times. This &s;eems only a preparation for bring|ing their &s;pawn to maturity;
for without farther delay they withdraw to &s;eek a lodging upon land: in the
mean time, the &s;pawn grows larger, is excluded out of the body, and &s;ticks
to the barbs under the flap, or more properly the tail. This bunch is &s;een as
big as an hen's egg, and exactly re&s;embling the rowes of her|rings. In this
&s;tate of pregnancy, they once more &s;eek the &s;hore for the la&s;t time,
and &s;haking off their &s;pawn into the water, leave accident to bring it to
maturity. At this time whole &s;hoals of hungry fi&s;h are at the &s;hore in
expectation of this annual &s;upply; the &s;ea to a great di&s;tance &s;eems
black with them; and about two thirds of the crabs eggs are immediately
devoured by the&s;e rapacious invaders. The eggs that e&s;cape are hatched
under the &s;and; and &s;oon after millions at a time of the&s;e little crabs
are &s;een quitting the &s;hore, and &s;lowly travelling up to the
mountains.</P>
<P>The old ones, however, are not &s;o active to return; they
have become &s;o feeble and lean, that they can hardly creep along, and the
fle&s;h at that time changes its colour. The mo&s;t of them, therefore, are
obliged to continue in the flat parts of the country till they recover, mak|ing
holes in the earth, which they cover at the <PB N="374" REF="384"> mouth with
leaves and dirt &s;o that no air may enter. There they throw off their old
&s;hells, which they leave as it were quite whole, the place where they opened
on the belly being un|&s;een. At that time they are quite naked, and almo&s;t
without motion for &s;ix days together, when they become &s;o fat as to be
delicious food. They have then under their &s;tomachs four large white
&s;tones, which gradually de|crea&s;e in proportion as the &s;hell hardens, and
when they come to perfection are not to be found. It is at that time that the
animal is &s;een &s;lowly making its way back; and all this is mo&s;t commonly
performed in the &s;pace of &s;ix weeks.</P>
<P>This animal when po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of its retreats in the
mountains is impregnable; for only &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting upon vegetables, it
&s;eldom ventures out; and its habitation being in the mo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible
places, it remains for a great part of the &s;ea&s;on in perfect &s;ecurity. It
is only when impelled by the de&s;ire of bringing forth its young, and when
compelled to de&s;cend into the flat country, that it is taken. At that time
the natives wait for its de&s;cent in eager expectation, and de&s;troy
thou&s;ands; but di&s;regarding the bodies, they only &s;eek for that &s;mall
&s;pawn which lies on each &s;ide of the &s;tomach within the &s;hell, of about
<PB N="375" REF="385"> the thickne&s;s of a man's thumb. They are much more
valuable upon their return after they have ca&s;t their &s;hell; for being
covered with a &s;kin re&s;embling &s;oft parchment, almo&s;t every part except
the &s;tomach may be eaten. They are taken in their holes by feeling for them
in the ground with an in&s;trument: they are &s;ought after by night, when on
their journey, with flambeaux. The in&s;tant the animal perceives it&s;elf
attacked, it throws it&s;elf on its back, and with its claws pinches mo&s;t
terribly whatever it happens to fa&s;ten on. But the dextrous crab-catcher
takes them by the hinder legs in &s;uch a manner, that its nippers cannot touch
him, and thus he throws it into his bag. Sometimes al&s;o they are caught when
they take refuge at the bottom of holes, in rocks by the &s;ea-&s;ide, by
clapping a &s;tick at the mouth of the hole, which prevents their getting out;
and then &s;oon after the tide coming, enters the hole, and the ani|mal is
found upon its retiring drowned in its retreat.</P>
<P>The&s;e crabs are of con&s;iderable advantage to the natives;
and the &s;laves very often feed entirely upon them. In Jamaica, where they are
found in great plenty, they are con&s;idered as one of the greate&s;t
delicacies of the place. Yet &s;till, the eating of them is attended with 
<PB N="376" REF="386"> &s;ome danger; for even of this kind many are found
poi&s;onous, being fed, as it is thought, upon the makinel apple; and whenever
they are found under that noxious plant, they are always rejected with caution.
It is thus with almo&s;t all the productions of tho&s;e luxurious climates;
however tempting they may be to the appetite, they but too often are found
de|&s;tructive; and &s;carce a delicacy among them that does not carry its own
alloy.</P>
<P>The de&s;cent of the&s;e creatures for &s;uch im|portant
purpo&s;es de&s;erves our admiration; but there is an animal of the lob&s;ter
kind that an|nually de&s;cends from its mountains in like man|ner, and for
purpo&s;es &s;till more important and various. Its de&s;cent is not only to
produce an offspring, but to provide it&s;elf a covering; not only to &s;ecure
a family, but to furni&s;h an hou&s;e. The animal I mean is the &s;oldier-crab,
which has &s;ome &s;imilitude to the lob&s;ter, if dive&s;ted of its &s;hell.
It is u&s;ually about four inches long, has no &s;hell behind, but is covered
down to the tail with a rough &s;kin, terminating in a point. It is however
armed with &s;trong hard nippers before, like the lob&s;ter; and one of them is
as thick as a man's thumb, and pinches mo&s;t powerfully. It is, as I &s;aid,
without a &s;hell to any part except its nippers; but what 
<PB N="377" REF="387"> Nature has denied this animal it takes care to &s;upply
by art; and taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the de|&s;erted &s;hell of &s;ome
other animal, it re&s;ides in it, till, by growing too large for its
habitation, it is under a nece&s;&s;ity of change. It is a native of the
We&s;t-India I&s;lands; and, like the former, it is &s;een every year
de&s;cending from the moun|tains to the &s;ea-&s;hore, to depo&s;it its
&s;pawn, and to provide it&s;elf with a new &s;hell. This is a mo&s;t
bu&s;tling time with it, having &s;o many things to do; and, in fact, very
bu&s;y it appears. It is very probable that its fir&s;t care is to provide for
its offspring before it attends to its own wants; and it is thought, from the
number of little &s;hells which it is &s;een examining, that it depo&s;its its
&s;pawn in them, which thus is placed in perfect &s;ecurity till the time of
exclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>However this be, the &s;oldier is in the end by no means
unmindful of it&s;elf. It is &s;till &s;een in its old &s;hell, which it
appears to have con&s;ider|ably outgrown; for a part of the naked body is
&s;een at the mouth of it, which the habitation is too &s;mall to hide. A
&s;hell, therefore, is to be found large enough to cover the whole body; and
yet not &s;o large as to be unmanage|able and unwieldy. To an&s;wer both
the&s;e ends is no ea&s;y matter, nor the attainment of a &s;light 
<PB N="378" REF="388"> enquiry. The little &s;oldier is &s;een bu&s;ily
pa|rading the &s;hore along that line of pebbles and &s;hells that is formed by
the extreme&s;t wave; &s;till, however, dragging its old incommodious
habitation at its tail, unwilling to part with one &s;hell, even though a
trouble&s;ome appendage, till it can find another more convenient. It is &s;een
&s;topping at one &s;hell, turning it and pa&s;&s;ing it by, going on to
another, contemplating that for a while, and then &s;lipping its tail from its
old habitation, to try on the new. This al&s;o is found to be inconvenient; and
it quickly returns to its old &s;hell again. In this manner it frequently
changes, till at la&s;t it finds one light, roomy and commodious; to this it
ad|heres, though the &s;hell be &s;ometimes &s;o large as to hide the body of
the animal, claws and all<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Pere du
Te&s;tre.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Yet it is not till after many trials, but many combats al&s;o,
that the &s;oldier is thus completely equipped; for there is often a conte&s;t
between two of them for &s;ome well looking favourite &s;hell for which they
are rivals. They both en|deavour to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; they &s;trike with
their claws; they bite each other, till the weake&s;t is obliged to yield, by
giving up the object of di&s;|pute. It is then that the victor immediately
takes <PB N="379" REF="389"> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and parades it in his new
conque&s;t three or four times back and forward upon the &s;trand before his
envious antagoni&s;t.</P>
<P>When this animal is taken, it &s;ends forth a feeble cry,
endeavouring to &s;eize the enemy with its nippers; which if it fa&s;tens upon
it will &s;ooner die than quit the gra&s;p. The wound is very painful, and not
ea&s;ily cured. For this rea&s;on, and as it is not much e&s;teemed for its
fle&s;h, it is generally permitted to return to its old retreat to the
mountains in &s;afety. There it continues till the nece&s;&s;ity of changing
once more, and the de&s;ire of producing an offspring, expo&s;e it to fre&s;h
dangers the year en&s;uing.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of the Tortoi&s;e and its Kinds.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING de&s;cribed the lob&s;ter and the crab as animals in
&s;ome mea&s;ure approaching to the in&s;ect tribes, it will appear like
inju&s;tice to place the Tortoi&s;e among the number, that, from its
&s;trength, its docility, the warm red blood that is circulating in its veins,
de&s;erves to be ranked even above the fi&s;hes. But as this animal is covered,
like the lob&s;ter, with a &s;hell, as it is of an amphibious nature, and
brings forth its young from the egg without hatching, we mu&s;t be content to
degrade it among animals that in every re&s;pect it infinitely
&s;urpa&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Tortoi&s;es are u&s;ually divided into tho&s;e that live upon
land, and tho&s;e that &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the water; and u&s;e has made a
di&s;tinction even in the name; the one being called Tortoi&s;es, the other
Turtles. However, Seba has proved that all tortoi&s;es are amphibious; that the
land tor|toi&s;e will live in the water; and that the &s;ea turtle can be fed
upon land. A land tortoi&s;e was brought to him that was caught in one of the
canals of Am&s;terdam, which he kept for half a year in his hou&s;e, where it
lived very well <PB N="381" REF="391"> contented in both elements. When in the
water it remained with its head above the &s;urface; when placed in the &s;un,
it &s;eemed delighted with its beams, and continued immovable while it felt
their warmth. The difference, therefore, in the&s;e animals, ari&s;es rather
from their habits than their conformation; and, upon examina|tion, there will
be le&s;s variety found between them than between birds that live upon land,
and tho&s;e that &s;wim upon the water.</P>
<P>Yet, though Nature &s;eems to have made but few di&s;tinctions
among the&s;e animals, as to their conformation, yet, in their habits, they are
very di&s;&s;imilar; as the&s;e re&s;ult from the different qualities of their
food, and the different &s;orts of enemies they have to avoid or encounter. I
will therefore exhibit their figure and conforma|tion under one common
de&s;cription, by which their &s;light differences will be more obvious; and
then I will give a &s;eparate hi&s;tory of the manners of each, as
naturali&s;ts and travellers have taught us.</P>
<P>All tortoi&s;es, in their external form, pretty much
re&s;emble each other; their outward co|vering being compo&s;ed of two great
&s;hells, the one laid upon the other, and only touching at the edges: however,
when we come to look clo&s;er, we &s;hall find that the upper &s;hell is
com|po&s;ed <PB N="382" REF="392"> of no le&s;s than thirteen pieces, which are
laid flat upon the ribs, like the tiles of an hou&s;e, by which the &s;hell is
kept arched and &s;upported. The &s;hells both above and below that, which
&s;eem, to an inattentive ob&s;erver, to make each but one piece, are bound
together at the edges by very &s;trong and hard ligaments, yet with &s;ome
&s;mall &s;hare of motion. There are two holes at either edge of this vaulted
body; one for a very &s;mall head, &s;houlders and arms, to peep through; the
other at the oppo&s;ite edge, for the feet and the tail. The&s;e &s;hells the
animal is never di&s;engaged from; and they &s;erve for its defence again&s;t
every creature but man.</P>
<P>The tortoi&s;e has but a &s;mall head, with no teeth; having
only two bony ridges in the place, &s;errated and hard. The&s;e &s;erve to
gather and grind its food; and &s;uch is the amazing &s;trength of the jaws,
that it is impo&s;&s;ible to open them where they once have fa&s;tened. Even
when the head is cut off, the jaws &s;till keep their hold; and the mu&s;cles,
in death, pre&s;erve a tenacious rigidity. Indeed, the animal is
po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of equal &s;trength in all other parts of its body: the
legs, though &s;hort, are inconceivably &s;trong; and torpid as the tortoi&s;e
may appear, it has been known to carry five men &s;tanding 
<PB N="383" REF="393"> upon its back, with apparent ea&s;e and uncon|cern. Its
manner of going forward is by mov|ing its legs one after the other; and the
claws with which the toes are furni&s;hed, &s;ink into the ground like the
nails of an iron &s;hod wheel, and thus a&s;&s;i&s;t its progre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to its internal parts, not to enter into minute
anatomical di&s;qui&s;itions, it may not be improper to ob&s;erve, that the
blood circulates in this animal as in &s;ome cartilaginous fi&s;hes, and
&s;omething in the manner of a child in the womb. The greate&s;t quantity of
the blood pa&s;&s;es directly from the vena cava into the left ventricle of the
heart, which commu|nicates with the right ventricle by an opening; while the
auricles only receive what the ven|tricles &s;eem incapable of admitting. Thus
the blood is driven by a very &s;hort pa&s;&s;age through the circulation; and
the lungs &s;eem to lend only occa&s;ional a&s;&s;i&s;tance. From this
conformation the animal can &s;ub&s;i&s;t for &s;ome time, without u&s;ing the
lungs or breathing; at lea&s;t, the lungs are not &s;o nece&s;&s;ary an
in&s;trument for driving on the circulation as with us.</P>
<P>Such is the general &s;tructure of this animal, whether found
to live by land or water. With regard to the differences of the&s;e animals,
the <PB N="384" REF="394"> land tortoi&s;e, from its habits of making u&s;e of
its feet in walking, is much more nimble upon land than the &s;ea turtle: the
land tortoi&s;e, if thrown upon its back, by rocking and balancing its body,
like a child rocking in a cradle, at la&s;t turns it&s;elf upon its face again;
but the turtle, when once turned, continues without being able to move from the
&s;pot. In comparing the feet al&s;o of the&s;e animals, the nails upon the
toes of one that has been long u&s;ed to &s;cratch for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence upon
land, are blunt and worn; while tho&s;e that have only been employed in
&s;wimming, are &s;harp and long, and have more the &s;imilitude of fins. The
brain of the land tortoi&s;e is but &s;mall; and yet it is three times as large
as that of the turtle. There is a difference al&s;o in the &s;hape of their
eggs, and in the pa&s;&s;age by which they are ex|cluded; for, in the land
tortoi&s;e, the pa&s;&s;age is &s;o narrow, that the egg conforms to the
&s;hape of the aperture, and though round when in the body, yet becomes much
more oblong than tho&s;e of fowls, upon being excluded; otherwi&s;e they would
never be able to pa&s;s through the bony canal by which they are protruded: on
the contrary, the pa&s;&s;age is wider in the turtle, and therefore its eggs
are round. The&s;e are the mo&s;t &s;triking di&s;tinctions; but that which is 
<PB N="385" REF="395"> mo&s;t known is their &s;ize; the land tortoi&s;e often
not exceeding three feet long, by two feet broad; the &s;ea turtle being
&s;ometimes from five to &s;even feet long. The &s;ize, however, is but a
fallacious di&s;tinction; &s;ince land tortoi&s;es, in &s;ome parts of India,
grow to a very great magnitude; though probably not, as the an|cients affirm,
big enough for a &s;ingle &s;hell to &s;erve for the covering of an
hou&s;e.</P>
<P>But if the different kinds of tortoi&s;es are not
&s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;hed by their figure, they are very obviou&s;ly
di&s;tingui&s;hable by their me|thods of living. The land tortoi&s;e lives in
holes dug in the mountains, or near mar&s;hy lakes; the &s;ea turtle in
cavities of rocks, and exten&s;ive pa&s;tures at the bottom of the &s;ea. The
tor|toi&s;e makes u&s;e of its feet to walk with, and burrow in the ground; the
turtle chiefly u&s;es its feet in &s;wimming, or creeping at bottom.</P>
<P>The land tortoi&s;e is generally found, as was ob&s;erved
above, from one foot to five feet long, from the end of the &s;nout to the end
of the tail; and from five inches to a foot and an half acro&s;s the back. It
has a &s;mall head, &s;omewhat re&s;embling that of a &s;erpent; an eye without
the upper lid; the under eye-lid &s;erving to cover and keep that organ in
&s;afety. It has a &s;trong, &s;caly tail, like the lizard. Its head the animal
<PB N="386" REF="396"> can put out and hide at plea&s;ure, under the great
penthou&s;e of its &s;hell: there it can remain &s;ecure from all attacks;
there, defended on every &s;ide, it can fatigue the patience of the mo&s;t
formidable animal of the fore&s;t, that makes u&s;e only of natural &s;trength
to de&s;troy it. As the tortoi&s;e lives wholly upon vegetable food, it never
&s;eeks the encounter; yet, if any of the &s;maller ani|mals attempt to invade
its repo&s;e, they are &s;ure to &s;uffer. The tortoi&s;e, impregnably
defended, is furni&s;hed with &s;uch a &s;trength of jaw, that, though armed
only with bony plates in&s;tead of teeth, wherever it fa&s;tens, it infallibly
keeps its hold, until it has taken out the piece.</P>
<P>Though peaceable in it&s;elf, it is formed for war in another
re&s;pect, for it &s;eems almo&s;t en|dued with immortality. Nothing can kill
it; the depriving it of one of its members, is but a &s;light injury; it will
live, though deprived of the brain; it will live, though deprived of its head.
Redi informs us that, in making &s;ome experiments upon vital motion, he, in
the beginning of the month of November, took a land tortoi&s;e, made a large
opening in its &s;kull, and drew out all the brain, wa&s;hed the cavity, &s;o
as not to leave the &s;malle&s;t part re|maining, and then, leaving the hole
open, &s;et <PB N="387" REF="397"> the animal at liberty. Notwith&s;tanding
this the tortoi&s;e marched away without &s;eeming to have received the
&s;malle&s;t injury; only it &s;hut the eyes, and never opened them afterwards.
Soon after the hole in the &s;kull was &s;een to clo&s;e; and, in three days,
there was a complete &s;kin covering the wound. In this manner the animal
lived, without a brain, for &s;ix months; walking about unconcernedly, and
moving its limbs as before. But the Italian philo&s;opher, not &s;atisfied with
this experiment, carried it &s;till farther; for he cut off the head, and the
ani|mal lived twenty-three days after its &s;epara|tion from the body. The head
al&s;o continued to rattle the jaws, like a pair of ca&s;tanets, for above a
quarter of an hour.</P>
<P>Nor are the&s;e animals le&s;s long lived than difficult in
de&s;troying. Tortoi&s;es are com|monly known to exceed eighty years old; and
there was one kept in the Archbi&s;hop of Can|terbury's garden, at Lambeth,
that was re|membered above an hundred and twenty. It was at la&s;t killed by
the &s;everity of a fro&s;t, from which it had not &s;ufficiently defended
it&s;elf in its winter retreat, which was a heap of &s;and, at the bottom of
the garden.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual food of the land tortoi&s;e &s;eems not &s;o
nouri&s;hing as to &s;upply this extraordinary prin|ciple <PB N="388" REF="398"> of vitality. It lives upon vegetables in its retreats in the
mountains or the plain; and &s;eldom makes its prey of &s;nails or worms, but
when other food is not found in grateful plenty. It is fond al&s;o of fruits;
and when the fore&s;t affords them, is generally found not far from where they
grow. As it can move but &s;lowly, it is not very delicate in the choice of its
food; &s;o that it u&s;ually fills it&s;elf with what|ever offers. Tho&s;e that
are kept in a dome&s;tic &s;tate, will eat any thing; leaves, fruits, corn
bran, or gra&s;s.</P>
<P>From the &s;mallne&s;s of its brain, and the &s;lowne&s;s of
its motion, it obviou&s;ly appears to be a torpid, heavy animal, requiring
re&s;t and &s;leep; and, in fact, it retires to &s;ome cavern to &s;leep for
the winter. I already ob&s;erved that its blood circulated through the heart by
a &s;hort pa&s;&s;age; and that it did not, as anatomi&s;ts expre&s;s it, go
through the great circulation. With us and quadrupes the blood goes from the
veins to the heart; from the heart it is &s;ent to be &s;pread over the lungs;
from the lungs it re|turns to the heart again; and from thence it goes to the
arteries, to be di&s;tributed through the whole body. But its pa&s;&s;age in
the tortoi&s;e is much &s;horter; for, from the veins it goes to the heart;
then leaving the lungs entirely out of its cour&s;e, it takes a &s;hort cut, if
I may &s;o <PB N="389" REF="399"> &s;ay, into the beginning of the arteries,
which &s;end it round the animal frame. From hence we &s;ee the lungs are left
out of the circulation; and con&s;equently, the animal is capable of
con|tinuing to live without continuing to breathe. In this it re&s;embles the
bat, the &s;erpent, the mole, and the lizard; like them it takes up its dark
re&s;idence for the winter; and, at that time, when its food is no longer in
plenty, it happily becomes in&s;en&s;ible to the want. Nor is it unmindful to
prepare its retreat, and make it as convenient as po&s;&s;ible; it is
&s;ometimes bu|ried two or three feet in the ground, with its hole furni&s;hed
with mo&s;s, gra&s;s, and other &s;ub|&s;tances, as well to keep the retreat
warm, as to &s;erve for food, in ca&s;e it &s;hould prematurely wake from its
&s;tate of &s;tupefaction. But it mu&s;t not be &s;uppo&s;ed that, while it is
thus at re&s;t, it totally di&s;continues to breathe; on the contrary, an
animal of this kind, if put into a clo&s;e ve&s;&s;el, without air, will &s;oon
be &s;tifled; though not &s;o readily as in a &s;tate of vigour and
activity.</P>
<P>From this dormant &s;tate the tortoi&s;e is awa|kened by the
genial return of &s;pring; and is thought not to be much wa&s;ted by its long
confinement. To animals that live an hundred and fifty years, a &s;leep of
&s;ix months is but as <PB N="390" REF="400"> the nap of a night. All the
actions of the&s;e long lived creatures &s;eem formed upon a &s;cale
an&s;wering the length of their exi&s;tence: their &s;lumbers are for a
&s;ea&s;on; their motions are &s;low, and require time in every action: even
the act of procreation, which among other ani|mals is performed in a very few
minutes, is with them the bu&s;ine&s;s of days. About a month after their
enlargement from a torpid &s;tate, they prepare to tran&s;mit their
po&s;terity; and both continue joined, for near a month, together. The eggs of
the female are contained in the ovary, above the bladder, which, is extremely
large; and the&s;e are, before their exclu&s;ion, round and naked, with &s;pots
of red: after they are laid, however, they a&s;&s;ume another form, being
&s;maller and longer than tho&s;e of a hen. This alteration in the figure of
the eggs mo&s;t probably proceeds from the narrowne&s;s of the bony pa&s;&s;age
through which they are excluded. Swammerdam, who compared the &s;ize of the
eggs taken out of this animal's body with the diameter of the pa&s;&s;age
through which they were excluded, was of opinion that the bones them&s;elves
&s;eparated from each other, and clo&s;ed again; but, in my opinion, it is more
probable to &s;uppo&s;e, that the eggs, and not the bones, alter their form.
Certain it is, that they are round in the body, and that they are oval upon
being protruded.</P>
<P><PB N="391" REF="401">The eggs of all the tortoi&s;e kind,
like tho&s;e of birds, are furni&s;hed with a yolk and a white; but the &s;hell
is different, being &s;omewhat like tho&s;e &s;oft eggs that hens exclude
before their time: however, this &s;hell is much thicker and &s;tronger, and is
a longer time in coming to maturity in the womb. The land tortoi&s;e lays but a
few in number, if compared to the &s;ea turtle, who de|po&s;its from an hundred
and fifty to two hun|dred in a &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>The amount of the land tortoi&s;e's eggs, I have not been able
to learn; but, from the &s;carcene&s;s of the animal, I am apt to think they
cannot be very numerous. When it prepares to lay, the female &s;cratches a
&s;light depre&s;&s;ion in the earth, generally in a warm &s;ituation, where
the beams of the &s;un have their full effect: there depo&s;iting her eggs, and
covering them with gra&s;s and leaves, &s;he for&s;akes them, to be hatched by
the heat of the &s;ea&s;on. The young tortoi&s;es are generally excluded in
about twenty-&s;ix days; but, as the heat of the weather a&s;&s;i&s;ts, or its
coldne&s;s retards incubation, &s;ome|times it happens that there is a
difference of two or three days. The little animals no &s;ooner leave the egg
than they &s;eek for their provi&s;ion, entirely &s;elf-taught; and their
&s;hell, with which they are covered from the be|ginning, <PB N="392" REF="402"> expands and grows larger with age; As it is compo&s;ed of a variety
of pieces, they are all capable of exten&s;ion at their futures, and the
&s;hell admits of encrea&s;e in every direction. It is otherwi&s;e with tho&s;e
animals, like the lob|&s;ter, who&s;e &s;hell is compo&s;ed all of one piece,
that admits of no encrea&s;e; which, when the te|nant is too big for the
habitation, mu&s;t bur&s;t the &s;hell, and get another. But the covering of
the tortoi&s;e grows larger in proportion as the internal parts expand; in
&s;ome mea&s;ure re&s;em|bling the growth of the human &s;kull, which is
compo&s;ed of a number of bones, encrea&s;ing in &s;ize in proportion to the
quantity of the brain. All tortoi&s;es, therefore, as they never change their
&s;hell, mu&s;t have it formed in pieces; and though, in &s;ome that have been
de&s;cribed by painters or hi&s;torians, the&s;e marks have not been attended
to, yet we can have no doubt that they are general to the whole tribe.</P>
<P>It is common enough to take the&s;e animals into gardens, as
they are thought to de&s;troy in|&s;ects and &s;nails in great abundance. We
are even told that, in hot countries, they are ad|mitted into a dome&s;tic
&s;tate, as they are great de&s;troyers of bugs. How &s;o large and heavy an
animal is capable of being expert at &s;uch petty prey, is not ea&s;y to
conceive; but I have <PB REF="403">

</FIGURE> <PB N="393" REF="404"> &s;een &s;everal of them about
gentlemen's hou&s;es, that, in general, appear torpid, harmle&s;s and even fond
of employment. Children have &s;ome|times got upon the back of a tortoi&s;e;
and &s;uch was the creature's &s;trength, that it never &s;eemed overloaded,
but moved off with its bur|then to where it expected to be fed, but would carry
them no further. In winter they regularly find out a place to &s;leep in; but
in tho&s;e warm countries in which the tortoi&s;e is found larger, and in
greater plenty than in Europe, they live without retiring the whole year
round.</P>
<P>The Sea Tortoi&s;e, or Turtle as it is now called, is
generally found larger than the former. This element is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with
the property of encrea&s;ing the magnitude of tho&s;e animals, which are common
to the land and the ocean. The &s;ea pike is larger than that of fre&s;h-water;
the &s;ea bear is larger than that of the mountains; and the &s;ea turtle
exceeds the land tortoi&s;e in the &s;ame proportion. It is of different
magni|tudes, according to its different kinds; &s;ome turtles being not above
fifty pound weight, and &s;ome above eight hundred.</P>
<P>The Great Medit&egrave;rranean Turtle is the large&s;t of the
turtle kind with which we are acquainted. It is found from five to eight feet
long, and from &s;ix to nine hundred pounds <PB N="394" REF="405"> weight. But,
unluckily, its utility bears no proportion to its &s;ize; as it is unfit for
food, and &s;ometimes poi&s;on tho&s;e who eat it. The &s;hell al&s;o, which is
a tough &s;trong integument, re&s;embling an hide, is unfit for all
&s;erviceable purpo&s;es. One of the&s;e animals was taken in the year 1729, at
the mouth of the Loire, in nets that were not de&s;igned for &s;o large a
capture. This turtle, which was of enormous &s;trength, by its own &s;truggles
involved it&s;elf in the nets in &s;uch a manner as to be incapable of doing
mi&s;chief: yet, even thus &s;hackled, it ap|peared terrible to the
fi&s;hermen, who were at fir&s;t for flying; but finding it impotent, they
gathered courage to drag it on &s;hore, where it made a mo&s;t horrible
bellowing; and when they began to knock it on the head with their gaffs, it was
to be heard at half a mile's di&s;tance. They were &s;till further intimidated
by its nau&s;eous and pe&s;tilential breath, which &s;o powerfully affected
them, that they were near fainting. This ani|mal wanted but four inches of
being eight feet long, and was above two feet over: its &s;hell more
re&s;embled leather than the &s;hell of a tor|toi&s;e; and, unlike all other
animals of this kind, it was furni&s;hed with teeth in each jaw, one rank
behind another, like tho&s;e of a &s;hark: its feet al&s;o, different from the
re&s;t of this kind, wanted claws; <PB N="395" REF="406"> and the tail was
quite di&s;engaged from the &s;hell, and fifteen inches long, more re&s;embling
that of a quadrupede than a tortoi&s;e. This animal was then unknown upon the
coa&s;ts of France; and was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been brought into the European
&s;eas, in &s;ome India &s;hip that might be wrecked upon her return. Since
that, how|ever, two or three of the&s;e animals have been taken upon the
coa&s;ts; two in particular upon tho&s;e of Cornwall, in the year 1756, the
large&s;t of which weighed eight hundred pounds; and one upon the I&s;le of
Rhea, but two years before that, weighed between &s;even and eight hun|dred.
One, mo&s;t probably of this kind al&s;o, was caught about thirty years ago
near Scar|borough, and a good deal of company was in|vited to fea&s;t upon it:
a gentleman, who was one of the gue&s;ts, told the company that it was a
Mediterranean turtle, and not whole&s;ome; but a per&s;on who was willing to
&s;atisfy his appe|tite at the ri&s;que of his life, eat of it: he was &s;eized
with a violent vomiting and purging; but his con&s;titution overpowered the
malignity of the poi&s;on.</P>
<P>The&s;e are a formidable and u&s;ele&s;s kind, if compared to
the turtle caught in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean. The&s;e are of
different kinds; not only unlike each other <PB N="396" REF="407"> in form, but
furni&s;hing man with very different advantages. They are u&s;ually
di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;ailors into four kinds; the Trunk Turtle, the
Loggerhead, the Hawk&s;bill, and the Green Turtle.</P>
<P>The Trunk Turtle is commonly larger than the re&s;t, and its
back higher and rounder. The fle&s;h of this is rank, and not very
whole&s;ome.</P>
<P>The Loggerhead is &s;o called from the large|ne&s;s of its
head, which is much bigger in pro|portion than that of the other kinds. The
fle&s;h of this al&s;o is very rank, and not eaten but in ca&s;e of
nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>The Hawk&s;bill Turtle is the lea&s;t of the four, and has a
long and &s;mall mouth, &s;omewhat re|&s;embling the bill of an hawk. The
fle&s;h of this al&s;o is very indifferent eating; but the &s;hell &s;erves for
the mo&s;t valuable purpo&s;es. This is the animal that &s;upplies the
tortoi&s;e-&s;hell of which &s;uch a variety of beautiful trinkets are made.
The &s;ub&s;tance of which the &s;hells of other turtles are compo&s;ed, is
thin and porous; but that of the hawk&s;bill is firm, and, when po|li&s;hed, is
beautifully marbled. They generally carry about three pounds; but the large&s;t
of all &s;ix pounds. The &s;hell con&s;i&s;ts, as in all the kind, of thirteen
leaves or plates, of which eight are flat, and five hollow. They are rai&s;ed
and <PB N="397" REF="408"> taken off by means of fire, which is made under
under the &s;hell after the fle&s;h is taken out. As &s;oon as the heat affects
the leaves, they &s;tart from the ribs, and are ea&s;ily rai&s;ed with the
point of a knife. By being &s;craped and poli&s;hed on both &s;ides, they
become beautifully tran&s;parent; or are ea&s;ily ca&s;t into what form the
workman thinks proper, by making them &s;oft and pliant in warm water, and then
&s;crewing them in a mold, like a medal: however, the &s;hell is mo&s;t
beau|tiful before it undergoes this la&s;t operation.</P>
<P>But of all animals of the tortoi&s;e kind, the green turtle is
the mo&s;t noted, and the mo&s;t valuable. The delicacy of its fle&s;h, and its
nutritive qualities, together with the property of being ea&s;ily dige&s;ted,
were, for above a century, known only to our &s;ea-men and the inhabitants of
the coa&s;ts where they were taken. It was not till by &s;low degrees the
di&s;tinction came to be made between &s;uch as were malignant and &s;uch as
were whole&s;ome. The controver&s;ies and contradictions of our old travellers
were nu|merous upon this head; &s;ome a&s;&s;erting, that the turtle was
delicious food; and others, that it was actual poi&s;on. Dampier, that rough
&s;ea-man, who has added more to natural hi&s;tory than half of the
philo&s;ophers that went before him, appears to be the fir&s;t who informed us 
<PB N="398" REF="409"> of their di&s;tinctions; and that, while the re&s;t
might be valuable for other purpo&s;es, the green turtle alone was chiefly
prized for the delicacy of its fle&s;h. He never imagined, however, that this
animal would make its way to the lux|urious tables of Europe; for he &s;eems
chiefly to recommend it as &s;alted up for &s;hip's provi|&s;ion, in ca&s;e of
nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent the turtle is very well known among us; and is
become the favourite food of tho&s;e that are de&s;irous of eating a great deal
without the danger of &s;urfeiting. This is a property the fle&s;h of the
turtle &s;eems peculiarly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of; and by the importation of it
alive among us, gluttony is freed from one of its greate&s;t re&s;traints. The
fle&s;h of turtle is become a branch of commerce; and therefore &s;hips are
provided with conveniences for &s;up|plying them with water and provi&s;ion, to
bring them over in health from Jamaica and other We&s;t India i&s;lands. This,
however, is not al|ways effected; for though they are very viva|cious, and
&s;carce require any provi&s;ion upon the voyage, yet, by the working of the
&s;hip and their beating again&s;t the &s;ides of the boat that contains them,
they become battered and lean; &s;o that to eat this animal in the highe&s;t
perfection, in&s;tead of bringing the turtle to <PB N="399" REF="410"> the
epicure, he ought to be tran&s;ported to the turtle.</P>
<P>This animal is called the green turtle, from the colour of its
&s;hell, which is rather greener than that of others of this kind. It is
ge|nerally found about two hundred weight; though &s;ome are five hundred, and
others not above fifty. Dampier tells us of one that was &s;een at Port Royal
in Jamaica, that was &s;ix feet broad acro&s;s the back: he does not tell us
its other dimen&s;ions; but &s;ays, that the &s;on of Captain Roach, a boy
about ten years old, &s;ailed in the &s;hell, as in a boat, from the &s;hore to
his father's &s;hip, which was above a quarter of a mile from land. But this is
nothing to the &s;ize of &s;ome turtles the ancients &s;peak of. Aelian
a&s;&s;ures us, that the hou&s;es in the I&s;land of Taprobane are u&s;ually
covered with a &s;ingle &s;hell. Diodorus Siculus tells us, that a people
neighbouring on Ethiopia, called the Turtle-eaters, coa&s;ted along the &s;hore
in boats made of the upper &s;hell of this animal; and that in war, when they
had eaten the fle&s;h, the covering &s;erved them as a tent. In this account,
Pliny, and all the re&s;t of the ancients agree; and as they had frequent
oppor|tunities of knowing the truth, we are not lightly to contradict their
te&s;timony.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent, however, they are not &s;een of 
<PB N="400" REF="411"> &s;uch amazing dimen&s;ions. We are told, by Laet, that
on the I&s;le of Cuba they grow to &s;uch a &s;ize, as that five men can
&s;tand on the back of one of them together; and what is more &s;urprizing
&s;till, that the animal does not &s;eem overloaded, but will go off with them
upon its back, with a &s;low &s;teady motion, towards the &s;ea.</P>
<P>They are found in the greate&s;t numbers on the I&s;land of
A&s;cen&s;ion; where, for &s;everal years, they were taken to be &s;alted to
feed the &s;laves, or for a &s;upply of &s;hip's provi&s;ion. Their value at
pre&s;ent &s;eems to be better known.</P>
<P>This animal &s;eldom comes from the &s;ea but to depo&s;it its
eggs, and now and then to &s;port in fre&s;h-water. Its chief food is a
&s;ubmarine plant, that covers the bottom of &s;everal parts of the &s;ea not
far from the &s;hore. There the turtles are &s;een, when the weather is fair,
feeding in great numbers, like flocks of &s;heep, &s;everal fa|thoms deep upon
the verdant carpet below. At other times they go to the mouths of rivers, as
they &s;eem to find gratification in fre&s;h|water. After &s;ome time thus
employed, they &s;eek their former &s;tations; and when done feeding, they
generally float with their heads above water, unle&s;s they are alarmed by the
approach of hunters or birds of prey, in which <PB N="401" REF="412"> ca&s;e
they &s;uddenly plunge to the bottom. They often &s;eek their provi&s;ion among
the rocks, feeding upon mo&s;s and &s;ea-weed; and it is pro|bable will not
di&s;dain to prey upon in&s;ects and other &s;mall animals, as they are very
fond of fle&s;h when taken and fed for the table.</P>
<P>At the time of breeding, they are &s;een to for&s;ake their
former haunts and their food, and to take &s;ometimes a voyage of nine hundred
miles to depo&s;ite their eggs on &s;ome favourite &s;hore. The coa&s;ts they
always re&s;ort to upon the&s;e occa&s;ions are tho&s;e that are low, flat, and
&s;andy; for being heavy animals, they cannot climb a bold &s;hore; nor is any
bed &s;o proper as &s;and to lay their eggs on. They couple in March, and
continue united till May; during a great part of which time they are &s;een
locked toge|ther, and almo&s;t incapable of &s;eparation. The female &s;eems
pa&s;&s;ive and reluctant; but the male gra&s;ps her with his claws in &s;uch a
manner, that nothing can induce him to quit his hold. It would &s;eem that the
gra&s;p, as in frogs, is in &s;ome mea&s;ure convul&s;ive, and that the animal
is unable to relax its efforts.</P>
<P>When the time for laying approaches, the female is &s;een
towards the &s;etting of the &s;un drawing near the &s;hore, and looking
earne&s;tly about her, as if afraid of being di&s;covered. 
<PB N="402" REF="413"> When &s;he perceives any per&s;on on &s;hore, &s;he
&s;eeks for another place; but if otherwi&s;e, &s;he lands when it is dark, and
goes to take a &s;urvey of the &s;and where &s;he de&s;igns to lay. Having
marked the &s;pot, &s;he goes back without laying for that night, to the ocean
again; but the next night returns to depo&s;ite a part of her burthen. She
begins by woking and digging in the &s;and with her fore-feet till &s;he has
made a round hole, a foot broad and a foot and an half deep, ju&s;t at the
place a little above where the water reaches highe&s;t. This done, &s;he lays
eighty or ninety eggs at a time, each as big as a hen's egg, and as round as a
ball. She continues laying about the &s;pace of an hour; during which time, if
a cart were driven over her, &s;he would not be induced to &s;tir. The eggs are
covered with a tough white &s;kin, like wetted parchment. When &s;he has done
laying, &s;he covers the hole &s;o dexterou&s;ly, that it is no ea&s;y matter
to find the place; and the&s;e mu&s;t be accu&s;tomed to the &s;earch to make
the di&s;covery. When the turtle has done laying &s;he returns to the &s;ea,
and leaves her eggs to be hatched by the heat of the &s;un. At the end of
fifteen days &s;he lays about the &s;ame number of eggs again; and at the end
of ano|ther fifteen days &s;he repeats the &s;ame; three <PB N="403" REF="414">
times in all, u&s;ing the &s;ame precautions every time for their
&s;afety..</P>
<P>In about twenty-four or twenty-five days after laying, the
eggs are hatched by the heat of the &s;un; and the young turtles, being about
as big as quails, are &s;een bur&s;ting from the &s;and, as if earth-born, and
running directly to the &s;ea, with in&s;tinct only for their guide: but, to
their great misfortune, it often happens that, their &s;trength being &s;mall,
the &s;urges of the &s;ea, for &s;ome few days, beat them back upon the
&s;hore. Thus expo&s;ed, they remain a prey to thou&s;ands of birds that then
haunt the coa&s;ts; and the&s;e &s;tooping down upon them carry off the
greate&s;t part, and &s;ometimes the whole brood, before they have &s;trength
&s;ufficient to with&s;tand the waves, or dive to the bottom. Helbigius informs
us, that they have &s;till another enemy to fear, which is no other than the
parent that produced them, that waits for their arrival at the edge of the
deep, and devours as many as &s;he can. This circum&s;tance however demands
further confirmation; though nothing is more certain than that the crocodile
acts in the &s;ame unnatural manner.</P>
<P>When the turtles have done laying they then return to their
accu&s;tomed places of feeding. <PB N="404" REF="415"> Upon their out-&s;et to
the &s;hore, where they breed, they are always found fat and healthy; but upon
their return, they are weak, lean, and unfit to be eaten. They are &s;eldom,
therefore, mole&s;ted upon their retreat; but the great art is to &s;eize them
when arrived, or to intercept their arrival. In the&s;e uninhabited i&s;lands,
to which the green turtle chiefly re&s;orts, the men that go to take them land
about night-fall, and without making any noi&s;e (for tho&s;e animals, though
without any external opening of the ear, hear very di&s;tinctly, there being an
auditory conduit that opens into the mouth) lie clo&s;e while they &s;ee the
female turtle coming on &s;hore. They let her proceed to her greate&s;t
di&s;tance from the &s;ea; and then, when &s;he is mo&s;t bu&s;ily employed in
&s;cratching a hole in the &s;and, they &s;ally out and &s;urprize her. Their
manner is to turn her upon her back, which utterly incapacitates her from
moving; and yet, as the creature is very &s;trong and &s;truggles very hard,
two men find it no ea&s;y matter to lay her over. When thus &s;ecured they go
to the next; and in this manner, in le&s;s than three hours, they have been
known to turn forty or fifty turtles, each of which weighs from an hundred and
fifty to two hun|dred pounds. Labat a&s;&s;ures us that when 
<PB N="405" REF="416"> the animal is in this helple&s;s &s;ituation, it is
heard to &s;igh very heavily, and even to &s;hed tears.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent, from the great appetite that man has
di&s;covered for this animal, they are not only thinned in their numbers, but
are al&s;o grown much more &s;hy. There are &s;everal other ways, therefore,
contrived for taking them. One is, to &s;eize them when coupled together, at
the breeding &s;ea&s;on, when they are very ea&s;ily approached, and as
ea&s;ily &s;een; for the&s;e ani|mals, though capable of living for &s;ome time
under water, yet ri&s;e every eight or ten minutes to breathe. As &s;oon as
they are thus perceived, two or three people draw near them in a canoe, and
&s;lip a nooze either round their necks or one of their feet. If they have no
line, they lay hold of them by the neck, where they have no &s;hell, with their
hands only; and by this means they u&s;ually catch them both to|gether. But
&s;ometimes the female e&s;capes, being more &s;hy than the male.</P>
<P>Another way of taking them is by the har|poon, either when
they are playing on the &s;ur|face of the water, or feeding on the bottom; when
the harpoon is &s;kilfully darted, it &s;ticks fa&s;t in the &s;hell of the
back; the wood then di&s;engages from the iron, and the line is long 
<PB N="406" REF="417"> enough for the animal to take its range; for if the
Harpooner &s;hould attempt at once to draw the animal into his boat till it is
weakened by its own &s;truggling, it would probably get free. Thus the turtle
&s;truggles hard to get loo&s;e, but all in vain; for they take care the line
fa&s;tened to the harpoon &s;hall be &s;trong enough to hold it.</P>
<P>There is yet another way which, though &s;eemingly awkward, is
&s;aid to be attended with very great &s;ucce&s;s. A good diver places
him|&s;elf at the head of the boat; and when the turtles are ob&s;erved, which
they &s;ometimes are in great numbers, a&s;leep on the &s;urface, he
im|mediately quits the ve&s;&s;el, at about fifty yards di&s;tance, and keeping
&s;till under water, directs his pa&s;&s;age to where the turtle was &s;een,
and, coming up beneath, &s;eizes it by the tail; the animal awaking,
&s;truggles to get free; and by this both are kept at the &s;urface until the
boat arrives to take them in.</P>
