<P>REMARKS ON THE USES OF THE DEFINITIVE ARTICLE IN THE GREEK TEXT OF THE NEW TESTAMENT; CONTAINING MANY NEW PROOFS OF THE DIVINITY OF CHRIST, FROM PASSAGES, WHICH ARE WRONGLY TRANSLATED IN THE COMMON ENGLISH VERSION.</P>

<P><HI>THE fir&s;t part of the following Remarks on the u&s;es of the definitive article in the Greek Text of the New Te&s;tament was printed in the &s;econd Fa&s;ciculus of the Mu&s;eum Oxonien&s;e. A Supplement to the Re|marks was at the &s;ame time promi&s;ed to be publi&s;hed in the third Fa&s;ciculus of the Mu&s;eum. But as many learned friends concurred with the Editor in thinking that the Remarks contain a very valuable acce&s;&s;ion to the evidences of Chri&s;t's divinity, he was unwilling to detain the Supplement, which exemplifies the Rules of the Remarks, any longer from the publick, and has there|fore prevailed on Mr Sharp to permit him to publi&s;h it with the Remarks. He earne&s;tly recommends them both to Mr Wakefield's mo&s;t deliberate con&s;ideration.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To Mr Sharp's Remarks and Supplement he has &s;ubjoined a plain hi&s;torical proof of the divinity of Chri&s;t founded on</HI> Chri&s;t's own te&s;timony of him&s;elf atte&s;ted and interpreted by his living witne&s;&s;es and enemies,
<PB N="vi" REF="5">the Jews,&mdash;<HI>on</HI> the evidence of his trial and crucifix|ion, <HI>and on</HI> the mo&s;t explicit declarations of the A|po&s;tles after the Re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t. <HI>What ap|peared to him to be a &s;ub&s;tantial and unan&s;werable ar|gument, he has, in this little exerci&s;e on the &s;ubject, en|deavoured to render an ea&s;y and popular proof, of our Saviour's divinity. It was printed &s;eparately for the u&s;e of the unlearned part of his pari&s;hioners, and is &s;ubjoin|ed to this treati&s;e for the convenience of other unlearned readers, and &s;uch as may not have much con&s;idered the &s;ubject.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A LETTER TO THE REV. MR &mdash; CONCERNING THE USES OF THE GREEK ARTICLE <GAP DESC="foreign"> IN THE NEW TESTAMENT.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Old Jewry, London</HI> <DATE>10th <HI>June,</HI> 1778.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I look upon the date of your la&s;t oblig|ing letter, I am much a&s;hamed that I have &s;o long neglected to acknowledge the receipt of it. The truth is, I began a letter a few days afterwards; but recol|lecting that I had written on the &s;ame &s;ubject (viz. the u&s;e of the Greek article <GAP DESC="foreign"> and copulative <GAP DESC="foreign">) to a very learned friend, at a great di&s;tance in the coun|try, I was willing to wait for his an&s;wer, le&s;t it &s;hould oblige me to make any alterations in my rules; and &s;o, indeed, it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> proved; for he objected to my fir&s;t rule (as it was then &s;tated) and has cited &s;everal ex|ceptions to it, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> thought &s;ufficient to &s;et it entirely a&s;ide: but this, I am convinced, is going too far, and would be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> injury to truth. The u&s;e there|fore
<PB N="4" REF="9">which I have made of my friend's objections, has been, to correct my rule, and add to it &s;uch li|mitations as might include the &s;everal exceptions, cited by my learned friend, as well as others, that are &s;imilar to them.</P>
<P>The waiting for my friend's an&s;wer and the nece&s;|&s;ary corrections in con&s;equence of it, together with a variety of other engagements, has prevented me from complying with your reque&s;t &s;o &s;oon as I could have wi&s;hed; but I &s;hall now &s;ubmit to your con&s;i|deration and candour, the rules in que&s;tion; and beg that you will be plea&s;ed to favour me with whatever examples may occur in the cour&s;e of your reading, either as exceptions to invalidate the <HI>fir&s;t rule,</HI> or as proofs to e&s;tabli&s;h and confirm it. The rea&s;ons of my recommending the fir&s;t rule more particularly to your attention, is, becau&s;e it is of much more con|&s;equence than any of the re&s;t, as it will enable us (if the truth of it be admitted) to correct the tran&s;lation of &s;everal important texts in the pre&s;ent Engli&s;h ver|&s;ion of the New Te&s;tament, in favour of a fundamen|tal article of our church, which has, of late, been much oppo&s;ed and traduced, I mean the belief that our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is truly God.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="rule">

<PB N="7" REF="12">requires a con&s;truction different from what is here laid down; EXCEPT the nouns be <HI>proper names,</HI> or <HI>in the plural number;</HI> in which ca&s;es there are many exceptions; though there are not wanting exam|ples, even of plural nouns, which are expre&s;&s;ed ex|actly agreeable to this rule.</P>
<P>As the examples which I have annexed to my fir&s;t rule con&s;i&s;t of texts, wherein the &s;en&s;e is &s;o plain, that there can be no controver&s;y concerning the par|ticular per&s;ons, to whom the &s;everal nouns are ap|plicable, it will be thought, I hope, that I have al|ready cited a &s;ufficient number of them to authen|ticate and ju&s;tify the rule. There are &s;everal other texts wherein the mode of expre&s;&s;ion is exactly &s;imi|lar, and which therefore do nece&s;&s;arily require a con&s;truction agreeable to the &s;ame rule, though the pre&s;ent Engli&s;h ver&s;on has unhappily rendered them in a different &s;en&s;e, and has thereby concealed from the mere <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> reader many &s;triking proofs <HI>con|cerning the Godhead</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign"> Col. ii. 9.) of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t.

<P>This, in the common engli&s;h ver&s;ion, is render|ed (very erroneou&s;ly) as if two di&s;tinct per&s;ons were mentioned, viz. <HI>"according to the grace of our God, and the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t."</HI> But if two di&s;tinct per&s;ons had really been intended to be expre&s;&s;ed as (by innumerable examples of the grammatical con&s;truction of &s;entences for the accurate di&s;tinc|tion of per&s;ons peculiar to the greek tongue, u&s;ed in the greek te&s;tament, from which the preceeding rules were formed) may be demon&s;trated, the arti|cle would have been repeated (according to the &s;ixth rule) after the copulative and before the &s;e|cond &s;ub&s;tantive <GAP DESC="foreign">. For it is manife&s;t that the
<PB N="27" REF="32">in&s;ertion of the comma, in &s;ome greek copies, after <GAP DESC="foreign">, is a modern interpolation; becau&s;e the expe|dient of breaking &s;entences into &s;mall divi&s;ions or particles by commas, to pre&s;erve the nece&s;&s;ary di&s;|tinctions, was not anciently u&s;ed (nor likely to have been u&s;ed) by the ancient writers of the greek tongue, who were accu&s;tomed to much more accurate di&s;tinctions in their various pecu|liar modes of grammatical expre&s;&s;ion, &s;pecified in the &s;ix preceding rules.</P>
<P>Whole &s;entences are, indeed, di&s;tingui&s;hed in the olde&s;t greek MSS. by a &s;ingle point placed at their end, &s;ometimes towards the top of the line, &s;ometimes in the middle, and &s;ometimes towards the bottom; but apparently no di&s;tinction of <HI>time</HI> has been intended by any of the&s;e three different modes of placing the point, for they are all placed indi&s;criminately to the mo&s;t obvious and full ter|mination of &s;entences; and therefore we may be a&s;&s;ured that, in all the&s;e three different modes of placing them, they were originally intended only as <HI>periods</HI> to conclude the &s;entences; &s;o that when we find them in the place of commas, to di&s;tingui&s;h merely the parts or particles of a &s;entence, there is great rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that they have been the ad|ditions of later times.</P>
<P>In the Alexandrian MS. the text before us is awkwardly divided by one of the&s;e points, placed after the word <GAP DESC="foreign">, which point, for the rea&s;on
<PB N="28" REF="33">before given, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be deemed a <HI>period,</HI> and which did not exi&s;t in the original text of the &s;acred penman.</P>
<P>The intention of the tran&s;criber or interpolator by adding this point to the text (for it cannot ju&s;tly be attributed to the original writer) has been probably to make a di&s;tinction of per&s;ons; as if <HI>two</HI> per&s;ons had been named in the text in&s;tead of <HI>one,</HI> in like manner as the comma is added after the word God, in the engli&s;h ver&s;ion, <HI>without any authority.</HI></P>
<P>But the nece&s;&s;ary grammatical con&s;truction of the whole &s;entence taken together detects the in|terpolator, and demon&s;trates the ab&s;urdity of &s;up|po&s;ing, that any &s;uch point ever exi&s;ted in the ori|ginal text, becau&s;e the words, which are &s;evered by the &s;uppo&s;ititious period, cannot form a grammati|cal &s;entence (according to the ordinary modes of expre&s;&s;ion u&s;ed in the greek tongue) by them&s;elves alone; &s;o that the obvious &s;en&s;e of the context demon&s;trates their nece&s;&s;ary connection with the preceding words <HI>in one entire &s;entence;</HI> and de|mon&s;trates al&s;o, at the &s;ame time, the ignorance and fallacy of the interpolator, who attempted to make two &s;entences of it by in&s;erting a full period.</P>
<P>If literally rendered, it ought to be&mdash;<Q><HI>according to the grace of the God and Lord of us Je&s;us Chri&s;t;</HI></Q> but, more in the idiom of our own language, it might be ju&s;tly rendered, <Q><HI>according to the grace of
<PB N="29" REF="34">Je&s;us Chri&s;t our God and Lord.</HI></Q> In either way the nece&s;&s;ary doctrine of <HI>our Lord's divine nature,</HI> manife&s;tly intended to be expre&s;&s;ed in the original, is duly retained in the propo&s;ed ver&s;ion.</P>

<P>In the greek of this text, as it is commonly printed, the article <GAP DESC="foreign"> is repeated before <GAP DESC="foreign">, which, &s;o far, affords an excu&s;e for the pre&s;ent engli&s;h ver&s;ion in placing the comma after the word God, to denote <HI>two</HI> di&s;tinct per&s;ons, according to the &s;ixth rule; but in the Alexandrian MS. and &s;everal other old copies the article <GAP DESC="foreign"> is <HI>not</HI> repeated after the copulative before <GAP DESC="foreign">, &s;o that the expre&s;&s;ion is exactly &s;imilar to the declaration of our Lord's <HI>divine nature</HI> by the &s;ame apo&s;tle in the preced|ing example, viz. I. Tim. v. 21. In &s;ome printed editions the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> is al&s;o omitted, but in the Geneva edition of 1620, with Scaliger's Notes, the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> is in&s;erted, and the article <GAP DESC="foreign"> omitted, whereby the title <GAP DESC="foreign"> (God) mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be con&s;trued in &s;uch a manner that it may be clearly under&s;tood in all ver&s;ions to be expres&s;ly applied <HI>to Chri&s;t,</HI> as it really is in the original. The tran|&s;criber or interpolator of the Alexandrian MS. however, being aware of this doctrine, has endea|voured to pervert it, by adding a full period after
<PB N="31" REF="36">the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> as <GAP DESC="foreign">. But this <HI>period</HI> is unque&s;tionably &s;uppo&s;ititious, becau&s;e the words before and after the period are <HI>not two di&s;tinct &s;entences,</HI> but obviou&s;ly, portions only of <HI>one entire &s;entence,</HI> which mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily be con&s;trued together, according to the ordinary rules of expre&s;&s;ion in the greek tongue, as I have remarked on a preceding example, whereby a &s;econd &s;ub&s;tantive of per&s;onal de&s;crip|tion, <HI>without an article before it,</HI> joined by a copu|lative to a preceding &s;ub&s;tantive of the like na|ture, and in the &s;ame ca&s;e, <HI>with an article before it,</HI> mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily denote a farther de&s;cription of the &s;ame per&s;on, expre&s;&s;ed by the fir&s;t &s;ub&s;tantive, (whenever there is an article before the fir&s;t &s;ub|&s;tantive and none before the &s;econd) &s;o that the in&s;ertion of the <HI>period</HI> in the Alexandrian MS. af|ter <GAP DESC="foreign"> is utterly vain, becau&s;e the <HI>copulative</HI> &s;uffici|ently proves the <HI>connection</HI> of the two &s;ub&s;tantives in one clear &s;entence, and the omi&s;&s;ion of the article before the &s;econd &s;ub&s;tantive induces the nece&s;&s;ity of applying the &s;ame grammatical con&s;truction whereby alone the due di&s;tinction of per&s;ons is &s;o peculiarly maintained in the greek tongue, and <HI>not by points.</HI> The text &s;hould therefore be rendered, &mdash;<Q>I charge (thee) therefore, before the God and Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &amp;c.</Q> or rather (to render the doctrine more obvious in the engli&s;h idiom)&mdash;<Q>I charge (thee) therefore, before Je&s;us Chri&s;t the God and Lord, who &s;hall judge the quick and
<PB N="32" REF="37">the dead, &amp;c.</Q> And thus the texts in the two la&s;t examples will perfectly accord as the uniform ex|pre&s;&s;ions of the &s;ame apo&s;tle, a&s;&s;erting, in both, the <HI>divinity of his Lord and Saviour,</HI> by whom he had been per&s;onally &s;ummoned to bear his te&s;timony to the gentiles, as being an eye and ear witne&s;s of his <HI>glorious maje&s;ty.</HI></P>
<P>Our Socinian Sadducees, who have impiou&s;ly en|tituled our Lord <HI>"a mere man,"</HI> and <HI>"nothing but a man,"</HI> and <HI>&s;imple human nature,</HI> will not be able to dige&s;t this nece&s;&s;ary doctrine, until they humble them&s;elves to receive in&s;tructions from the holy &s;criptures.</P>

<PB N="33" REF="38">or <GAP DESC="foreign">. On which it is nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve that the &s;ame remarks are obviou&s;ly applicable to this &s;uper|fluous and ab&s;urd addition of the point, or <HI>period,</HI> that I have made on the texts, II.

For as the proper effect and purpo&s;es of <HI>periods</HI> is to &s;eparate words into <HI>di&s;tinct &s;entences,</HI> it is obvious that the words, which follow the &s;uppo|&s;ititious period in this text, are incapable of a gram|matical con&s;truction without reference to the preceding words, connected by the <HI>copulative;</HI> and therefore the <HI>note</HI> of <HI>&s;eparation</HI> (a period) cannot po&s;&s;ibly have been intended by the in&s;pired writer.

<P>I made a tran&s;cript of this text, &s;everal years ago, from the Alexandrian MS. which I copied or ra|ther <HI>drew,</HI> letter by letter, in &s;ize and &s;hape as exactly as the eye could di&s;cern.

Dr Woide (who printed a copy of the new te&s;ta|ment from the Alexandrian MS. with new types in imitation of the letters of the MS.) to find that he had in&s;erted a point, in his new edition, after the
<PB N="36" REF="41">word <GAP DESC="foreign">. I was very con&s;ident that I could not di&s;cern any &s;uch point, when I examined the MS. and yet, as I entertained the highe&s;t re&s;pect and e&s;teem for the veracity and accuracy of Dr Woide (of which he was, indeed, truly worthy) it was nece&s;&s;ary to have this matter properly ex|plained; and I was rendered perfectly aware by Dr Velthu&s;en's account of his examining an an|cient MS. that the feint lines and marks in the very old MSS. are liable to bear different appear|ances, according to the different degrees of light in which they are &s;een.</P>
<P>I therefore took the fir&s;t opportunity, afterwards, of going once more to examine the MS. and on a more clo&s;e in&s;pection, I perceived, indeed, the <HI>feint</HI> mark which occa&s;ioned Dr Woide's in&s;ertion of the period, in his edition; but being afterwards a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the worthy librarian the Rev.

<P>But if any per&s;on, from the authority of Dr Woide's edition, &s;hould be &s;till inclined to &s;uppo&s;e that it is really <HI>a point,</HI> I mu&s;t reque&s;t them care|fully to con&s;ider what I have before remarked on the fourth, &s;ixth and &s;eventh examples in this tract, re&s;pecting the addition of <HI>points</HI> in greek manu|icripts;

<P><HI>FOR what END did Chri&s;t COME INTO THE WORLD?</HI></P>
<P>A. Chri&s;t was "manife&s;ted in the fle&s;h, (that is, was made man,)&mdash;TO DIE FOR THE SINS OF MAN|KIND,&mdash;to de&s;troy the works of the devil&mdash;to re|deem us from all iniquity, and to purity unto him|&s;elf a peculiar people zealous of good works." (1 Cor. xv. 3.&mdash;1 John iii. 8.&mdash;Tit ii. 14.)</P>
<P><HI>Q. Where was Chri&s;t before he came into this world, and was manife&s;ted in the fle&s;h?</HI></P>
<P>A. He was in Heaven. "He came down from Heaven. He was with God his Father, before the world was, before the foundation of the world: he was in the bo&s;om of his Father, and in his Father's Glory." (John iii. 13. vi. 33. 62. i. 1. xvii. 5. 24.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="53"><HI>Q. How was his manife&s;tation in the fle&s;h made known to the world?</HI></P>
<P>A. By the me&s;&s;age of an angel to Mary his mo|ther, to Jo&s;eph, and to certain &s;hepherds.</P>
<P><HI>Q. Under what name was be made known?</HI></P>
<P>A. He was called JESUS, a Saviour, the Son of God, the Son of the Highe&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Q. Who was the mother of Je&s;us?</HI></P>
<P>A. The Virgin Mary.</P>
<P><HI>Q. Was any prophe&s;y fulfilled by the birth of Je&s;us Chri&s;t?</HI></P>
<P>A. Yes: "all this was done, that it might be fulfilled, which was &s;poken of the Lord by the prophet, &s;aying, behold, a virgin &s;hall be with child, and &s;hall bring forth a Son, and they &s;hall call his name EMMANUEL, which being interpre|ted, is GOD WITH US." (Matt. i. 22, 23. I&s;aiah vii. 14.)</P>
<P><HI>Q. What was Chri&s;t put to death for?</HI></P>
<P>A. For bla&s;phemy, as the Jews thought it, in calling him&s;elf the Son of God.</P>
<P><HI>Q. In what did the Jews &s;ay the bla&s;phemy con|&s;i&s;ted?</HI></P>
<P>A. In this, that he being, as they &s;uppo&s;ed, a mere man, called God his own Father, thereby declaring him&s;elf to be equal with God, and to be God. (John v. 18. x. 33.)</P>

<P><HI>Catechi&s;t. Repeat the pa&s;&s;age, in which this is &s;aid.</HI></P>
<P>A. "And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own&s;elf, with the glory which I had with thee, before the world was." (John xvii. 5.)</P>
<P><HI>Q. What did Chri&s;t ever &s;ay of him&s;elf, which im|plied, that he was equal with God?</HI></P>
<P>A. He &s;aid that "he and his Father are one:" that "the Father hath given all things into his power:" that "what things &s;oever the Father doeth, the&s;e al&s;o doeth the Son likewi&s;e:" that "the Father hath committed all judgment to the Son, that all men &s;hould honour the Son, even as they honour the Father."

<P><HI>Q. Who were the fir&s;t witne&s;&s;es, in Chri&s;t's time, in proof of Chri&s;t's divinity?</HI></P>
<P>A. His enemies, the unbelieving Jews, both the people, and their rulers.</P>
<P><HI>Q. Do you call the unbelieving Jews prior witne&s;|&s;es to the Apo&s;tles?</HI></P>
<P>A. Yes: becau&s;e this great truth, THE DIVINTY OF CHRIST, was hid from the Apo&s;tles, as well as the re&s;t of their countrymen, till after Chri&s;t's RE|SURRECTION FROM THE DEAD. Chri&s;t fir&s;t a&s;&s;erted him&s;elf to be God, by calling God his Father, and him&s;elf the Son of God, in a &s;en&s;e, which implied,
<PB N="50" REF="55">that he was equal with God, and was God; for &s;o even his unbelieving hearers under&s;tood it:&mdash;the Jews condemned him to death for it:&mdash;the Apo&s;|tles preached it.</P>
<P><HI>Q. As Chri&s;t knew, that this was the &s;en&s;e in which the Jews under&s;tood his te&s;timony of him&s;elf, when they fir&s;t charged him with bla&s;phemy for it, did he, at his trial, attempt to deny the charge?</HI></P>
<P>A. No: he admitted the charge and confirmed it, and died for it; and appealed to the day of judgment, as their future proof of it.</P>
<P><HI>Catechi&s;t. Repeat the pa&s;&s;age.</HI></P>
<P>A. When "the high prie&s;t a&s;ked him, and &s;aid unto him, art thou the Chri&s;t, the Son of the Ble&s;|&s;ed? Je&s;us &s;aid, I am: and <HI>(as a proof of it,)</HI> YE &s;hall <HI>(at the la&s;t day)</HI> &s;ee <HI>(me)</HI> the Son of man fit|ting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of Heaven." (Mark xiv. 61, 62.)</P>
<P><HI>Q. If Chri&s;t had not been the Me&s;&s;iah, the Son of God, in the &s;en&s;e in which they under&s;tood him, would he not have undeceived them?</HI></P>
<P>A. If Je&s;us Chri&s;t had not been the Me&s;&s;iah, the Son of God, in the &s;en&s;e, in which the Jews un|der&s;tood him, he would have undeceived them, to &s;ave his own life, and to free them from a very great delu&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Q. But Je&s;us Chri&s;t was put to death for calling him&s;elf the Son of God; what then do you conclude?</HI></P>
<P>A. I conclude that Je&s;us Chri&s;t really was what
<PB N="51" REF="56">they charged him with calling him&s;elf, THE SON OF GOD; and in the &s;en&s;e in which they under&s;tood him; that is, that he was EQUAL WITH GOD; and was God.</P>
<P><HI>Q. You &s;ay that in the lifetime of Chri&s;t the Apo&s;|tles appeared not to know that Chri&s;t was God; what was their opinion after he ro&s;e from the dead?</HI></P>
<P>A. Convinced by his re&s;urrection from the dead, according to his promi&s;e that he would <HI>rai&s;e him&s;elf</HI> from the dead, they believed him to be "their Lord and ther God"&mdash;"the word made fle&s;h;" "God manife&s;ted in the fle&s;h;" in whom <Q>dwelt ALL the fulne&s;s of the Godhead bodily;</Q> Em|manuel," or, "God with us"&mdash;"the creator and upholder of all things," who "in the beginning" of all things "was with God, and was God"&mdash; "the true God and eternal life;" and "over all God ble&s;&s;ed for ever." (John xx. 28.&mdash;John i. 14. 1 Tim. iii. 16. Coi. ii. 9. Matt. i. 23.&mdash;John i. 2. Heb. i. 3. John i. 1.&mdash;1 John v. 20. Rom. ix. 5.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whatever difficulty may be found in the various readings of any of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, it mu&s;t vani&s;h, like a mi&s;t, in the full light of their united evidence. To them we may confidently add the very important te&s;timonies which in the preceding remarks and examples Mr Sharp has mo&s;t happily recovered from the erroneous con&s;tructions of the common ver&s;ion.</NOTE>)</P>
<P><HI>Q. Now tell me in few words, what you collect from Chri&s;t's te&s;timony of him&s;elf, as atte&s;ted by the Jews of
<PB N="52" REF="57">his own time, condemned by the rulers, but univer&s;ally propagated by the Apo&s;tles?</HI></P>
<P>A. The conclu&s;ion to be drawn from it, is, that Chri&s;t, the Son of God, is one with God, and equal with God, and is God. Chri&s;t a&s;&s;erted it; the Jews condemned him to die for it; he &s;ealed his te&s;timony with his blood. The Apo&s;tles, convin|ced by his re&s;urrection from the dead, believed it, and preached it, and died for it.</P>
<P><HI>Catechi&s;t. The Jews, then, put Chri&s;t to death, as an impo&s;tor and bla&s;phemer; and yet Chri&s;tians have believed in him and wor&s;hipped him, as the Son of God, for almo&s;t eighteen hundred years. How do you ac|count for this?</HI></P>
<P>A. It was in the decrees of God, that Chri&s;t &s;hould die for the &s;ins of mankind: If the Jews had believed him to be the Son of God, they would not have put him to death:&mdash;if he had not been put to death, as he was, he would not have "borne our &s;ins in his own body on the cro&s;s," that is, he would not have died for our &s;ins, THE END, for which he CAME INTO THE WORLD;&mdash;he would not have given that great and ine&s;timable proof of the truth of Scripture, and of his own promi&s;es, which HE did, by ri&s;ing from the dead; &mdash;and the Apo&s;tles would not have given that &s;ure evidence of their own belief in Chri&s;t, the ground and confirmation of OURS, which THEY did, by dy|ing for their crucified Lord and Ma&s;ter.</P>
