<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS the experiment of determining the univer&s;al at|traction of matter, which you lately conducted with &s;o much accuracy and &s;ucce&s;s, is of &s;o great im|portance and curio&s;ity, that it may probably be here|after repeated by the learned in other countries, and in other &s;ituations; and as the utmo&s;t preci&s;ion is de&s;irable
<PB N="4" REF="4">in &s;o nice an experiment; I have compo&s;ed the inclo&s;ed paper to determine the be&s;t part of a hill for making the ob&s;ervations, &s;o as to obtain the greate&s;t quantity of attraction.</P>
<P>I have no doubt, Sir, that the determination of this point will appear of &s;ome con&s;equence in the opinion of one who has the improvement of u&s;eful knowledge &s;o much at heart; and if the manner in which it is here made, meet your approbation, I &s;hall de&s;ire the favour of your pre&s;enting it to the Royal Society.</P>

<P N="1">1. The great &s;ucce&s;s of the experiment, lately made by the Royal Society, on the hill Schehallien, to deter|mine the univer&s;al attraction of matter, and the im|portant con&s;equences that have re&s;ulted from it, may probably give occa&s;ion to other experiments of the &s;ame kind to be made el&s;ewhere: and as all po&s;&s;ible means of accuracy and facility are to be de&s;ired in &s;o delicate and laborious an undertaking; it has occurred to me that it might not be unu&s;eful to add, by way of &s;up|plement to my paper of calculations relative to the a|bove-mentioned experiment, an inve&s;tigation of the height above the bottom of a hill, at which its horizon|tal attraction &s;hall be the greate&s;t; &s;ince that is the height at which commonly the ob&s;ervations ought to be made, and &s;ince this be&s;t point of ob&s;ervation has never been any where determined that I know of, but has been va|riou&s;ly &s;poken of or gue&s;&s;ed at, it being &s;ometimes ac|counted at &frac13;, and &s;ometimes at &frac12; of the height of the hill; whereas from the&s;e inve&s;tigations it is found to be generally at about only &frac14; of the altitude from the bottom.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let ABCEDA be part of a cuneus of matter, its &s;ides or faces being the two &s;imilar right-angled trian|gles ABC, ADE meeting in the point A, and forming the indefinitely &s;mall angle BAD. Then of any &s;ection
<PB N="6" REF="6">bced, perpendicular to the planes ABD and ADE, the attraction on a body at A in the direction AB, is equal to the con&s;tant quantity s<HI>s;</HI> where s &equals; &s;in. &morethan;BAC and <HI>s</HI> &equals; &s;in. &morethan;BAD, to the ra|dius 1.</P>
<P><FIGURE>

<P>For, fir&s;t, &s;ince the magnitude of the flowing &s;ec|tion is every where as A<HI>b</HI>^2, and the attraction of the particles of matter inver&s;ely as the &s;ame, or as 1/A<HI>b</HI>^2; therefore their product or A<HI>b</HI>^2/A<HI>b</HI>^2 or 1 (a con&s;tant quantity) is as the force of attraction of bced.</P>
<P>Then to find what that quantity is. Put AB &equals; <HI>a,</HI> and BC &equals; <HI>x;</HI> then BD or CE (the di&s;tance between the two planes at the di&s;tance AB) is &equals; <HI>as.</HI> Now the force of a particle in the line CE is as 1/AC^2 in the direction AC, and therefore it is as AB / AC^3 in the direction AB; con&s;equently the force of the whole lineola CE in the direction AB is AB.CE / AC^3 ; and therefore the fluxion of the force of the &s;ection BCED or <HI>f&cmbdot;</HI> is <GAP DESC="math">; and the fluent gives <GAP DESC="math"> for the attraction it&s;elf.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="7" REF="7">3. To find now the attraction of the whole right-angled cuneus on a body at A in the direction AB.&mdash; Since the force of each &s;ection is s<HI>s</HI> by the la&s;t article, therefore the force of all the &s;ections, the number of them being AB or <HI>a,</HI> is <HI>as</HI>s &equals; <HI>s</HI> . AB. BC / AC the force of the whole cuneus ABCEDA.</P>

<P N="4">4. To find the attraction of the rect|angular part ABCD on A in the direction AB; ABCD being one &s;ide of the cune|us, and AD its edge.&mdash;Put AD &equals; BC &equals; <HI>b,</HI> and AB &equals; <HI>x.</HI> Then, the force of any &s;ection as BC being always as s<HI>s</HI> by Art. 2, the fluxion of the force or <HI>f&cmbdot;</HI> will be <GAP DESC="math">; and the fluent is <GAP DESC="math"> the attraction of ABCD.</P>

<P N="5">5. To find the attraction of the right-angled part BCD of a cuneus who&s;e edge pa&s;&s;es through A the place of the body attracted.&mdash;Put AB &equals; <HI>a,</HI> BC &equals; <HI>b,</HI> BD &equals; <HI>c,</HI> DA &equals; <HI>d</HI> &equals; <HI>a</HI> &minus; <HI>c,</HI> DC &equals; <HI>e,</HI> AC &equals; <HI>g,</HI> and DP &equals; <HI>x.</HI> Then, the force of any &s;ection PQ being &s;till as s<HI>s,</HI> the fluxion of the force of the part DPQ is <GAP DESC="math">; and the correct fluent

<P N="6">6. To find the attraction of the right-angled part BCD on the point A.&mdash;U&s;ing here again the &s;ame notation as in the la&s;t article, we have <GAP DESC="math">. The correct fluent of which, when <HI>x</HI> &equals; <HI>c,</HI> is <GAP DESC="math">.</P>
<P N="7">7. To apply now the&s;e premi&s;es to the finding of the place where the attraction of a hill is greate&s;t, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;uppo&s;e the hill to have &s;ome certain fi|gure. That po&s;ition is mo&s;t convenient for ob&s;erving the attraction, in which the hill is mo&s;t extended in the ea&s;t and we&s;t direction. Suppo&s;ing then &s;uch a po&s;ition of a hill, and that it is al&s;o of a uniform height and meridional &s;ection throughout; the point of ob&s;erva|tion mu&s;t evidently be equally di&s;tant from the two ends. But in&s;tead of being only con&s;iderably extended, I &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e the hill to be indefinitely extended to the ea&s;t and to the we&s;t of the point of ob&s;ervation, in order that the inve&s;tigation may be mathematically true, and yet at the &s;ame time &s;ufficiently exact for the before-&s;aid limited extent al&s;o. It will al&s;o come neare&s;t to the
<PB N="9" REF="9" MS="y">practical experiment, to &s;uppo&s;e the hill to be a long triangular pri&s;m, &s;o that all its meridional &s;ections may be &s;imilar triangles. Let therefore the triangle ABC re|pre&s;ent its &s;ection by a verti|cal plane pa&s;&s;ing through the meridian, or one &s;ide of an indefinitely thin cuneus who&s;e edge is in PG; or rather PBCGP the &s;ide of one cuneus, and PAG the &s;ide of another, their common edge being the line PG perpendicular to the ba&s;e AC; P being the required point in the &s;ide AB where the attrac|tion of the &s;ection ABC, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> indefinitely thin cuneus, &s;hall be greate&s;t in a direction parallel to the horizon AC. And then from the foregoing &s;uppo&s;itions, it is evident that in whatever point of AB the attraction of ABC is greate&s;t, there al&s;o will the attraction of the whole hill be the greate&s;t.</P>

<P N="8">8. Now draw HPDEF parallel to AC; and AH, PG, BI, CF, perpendicular to the &s;ame. Then it is evident that at the point P, in the direction PF, the attraction of PBCGP is affirmative, and that of PAG negative. But PBCGP is &equals; PBD &plus; BDE &plus; PFCG &minus; EFC; and PAG &equals; PHAG &minus; PHA. Therefore the attractions of PBD, BDE, PFCG, PHA, are affirmative; and tho&s;e of EFC, PHAG, negative.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="10">Put now BI &equals; <HI>a,</HI> AI &equals; <HI>b,</HI> IC &equals; <HI>c,</HI> AB &equals; <HI>d,</HI> BC &equals; <HI>e,</HI> AC &equals; <HI>g</HI> &equals; <HI>b</HI> &plus; <HI>c,</HI> and PG &equals; <HI>x,</HI> the altitude of the point P above the bottom.

<P>By Art. 5, the attraction of EFC is <GAP DESC="math">.</P>
<P>La&s;tly by Art. 6, the attraction of BDE is <GAP DESC="math">.</P>
<P>The&s;e quantities being collected together with their proper &s;igns, and contracted, we have <GAP DESC="math"> for the whole attraction in the direction PE.</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="11" REF="11">9. Having now obtained a general formula for the mea&s;ure of the attraction in any &s;ort of triangle, if the particular values of the letters be &s;ub&s;tituted which any practical ca&s;e may require, and the fluxion of this at|traction be put &equals; 0, the root of the re&s;ulting equation will be the required height from the bottom of the hill.</P>
<P N="10">10. But for a more particular &s;olution in &s;impler terms, let us &s;uppo&s;e the triangle ABC to be i&s;o&s;celes, in which ca&s;e we &s;hall have <HI>d</HI> &equals; <HI>e,</HI> and <HI>g</HI> &equals; 2<HI>b</HI> &equals; 2<HI>c,</HI> and then the above general formula will become <GAP DESC="math"> for the value of the attraction in the ca&s;e of the i&s;o&s;|celes triangle, where <HI>q</HI>^2 is <GAP DESC="math">. And the fluxion of this expre&s;&s;ion being equated to 0, the equation will give the relation between <HI>a</HI> and <HI>x</HI> for any values of <HI>b</HI> and <HI>d,</HI> by a proce&s;s not very trouble|&s;ome.</P>
<P N="11">11. Now it is probable that the relation between <HI>a</HI> and <HI>x,</HI> when the attraction is greate&s;t, will vary with the various relations between <HI>b</HI> and <HI>d,</HI> or between <HI>b</HI> and <HI>a.</HI> Let us therefore find the limits of that relation, between which it may always be taken, by u&s;ing two particular extreme ca&s;es, the one in which the hill is
<PB N="12" REF="12">very &s;teep, and the other in which it is very flat, or <HI>a</HI> very &s;mall in re&s;pect of <HI>b</HI> or <HI>d.</HI></P>
<P N="12">12. And fir&s;t let us &s;uppo&s;e the triangular &s;ection to be equilateral; in which ca&s;e the angle of elevation is 60&deg;, which being a degree of &s;teepne&s;s that can &s;carce|ly ever happen, this may be accounted the fir&s;t extreme ca&s;e. Here then we &s;hall have <HI>d</HI> &equals; 2<HI>b</HI> &equals; &frac23;<HI>a</HI>&radic;3, and the formula in Art. 10, will become <HI>s</HI> &times; : 2<HI>a</HI>&minus;<HI>r</HI>&minus;<HI>x</HI>/2 &plus; <HI>x</HI> &times; h. l. 2<HI>a</HI>&plus;2<HI>r</HI>&minus;<HI>x</HI>/3<HI>x</HI> &plus; <HI>a</HI>&minus;<HI>x</HI>/4 &times; h. l. <HI>a</HI>&plus;2<HI>r</HI>&plus;<HI>x</HI>/<HI>a</HI>&minus;<HI>x</HI> for the value of the attraction in the ca&s;e of the equilateral triangle, in which <HI>r</HI> is <GAP DESC="math">.</P>
<P N="13">13. Or if we take <HI>x</HI> &equals; <HI>na,</HI> where <HI>n</HI> expre&s;&s;es what part of <HI>a</HI> is denoted by <HI>x,</HI> the la&s;t formula will become <GAP DESC="math"> for the ca&s;e of the equila|teral triangle.</P>
<P N="14">14. To find the maximum of the expre&s;&s;ion in the la&s;t article, put its fluxion &equals; 0, and there will re&s;ult this equation <GAP DESC="math">; the root of which is <HI>n</HI> &equals; .251999. Which &s;hews that, in the equilateral triangle, the height from the bottom to the point of greate&s;t attraction, is
<PB N="13" REF="13">only 1/500^t^h part more than &frac14; of the whole altitude of the triangle. And this is the limit for the &s;teepe&s;t kind of hills.</P>
<P N="15">15. Let us find now the particular values of the mea|&s;ure of attraction ari&s;ing by taking certain values of <HI>n</HI> varying by &s;ome &s;mall difference, in order to di&s;cover what part of the greate&s;t attraction is wanting by ob|&s;erving at different altitudes.</P>
<P N="16">16. And fir&s;t u&s;ing the value of <HI>n</HI> (.251999) as found in the 14^t^h article, the general formula in Art. 13, gives <HI>sa</HI> &times; 1.0763700 for the mea&s;ure of the greate&s;t at|traction.</P>
<P N="17">17. If <HI>n</HI> &equals; 3/10, or <HI>x</HI> &equals; 3/10<HI>a;</HI> the &s;ame formula gives <HI>sa</HI>/20 &times; : 17 &minus; &radic;79 &plus; 6h. l. 17&plus;2&radic;79/9 &plus; 7/2 h. l. 13&plus;2&radic;79/7 &equals; <HI>sa</HI> &times; 1.0702512 for the attraction at 3/10 of the altitude, which is &s;omething le&s;s than the other.</P>
<P N="18">18. If <HI>n</HI> &equals; 4/10 &equals; &frac25; the formula gives <HI>sa</HI>/20 &times; : 16 &minus; &radic;76 &plus; 8h. l. 8&plus;&radic;76/6 &plus; 3h. l. 7&plus;&radic;76/3 &equals; <HI>sa</HI> &times; 1.0224232 for the attraction at 4/10 or &frac25; of the altitude; le&s;s again than the la&s;t was.</P>
<P N="19">19. If <HI>n</HI> &equals; 5/10 &equals; &frac12;; the formula gives <GAP DESC="math"> for the attraction at half way up the hill; &s;till le&s;s again than the la&s;t.</P>
<P N="20"><PB N="14" REF="14">20. If <HI>n</HI> &equals; 6/10 &equals; &frac35;; the formula gives <HI>sa</HI>/20 &times; : 14 &minus; &radic;76 &plus; 12h. l. 7&plus;&radic;76/9 &plus; 2h. l. 8&plus;&radic;76/2 &equals; <HI>sa</HI> &times; .8109843 for the attraction at 6/10 or &frac35; of the altitude from the bottom; being &s;till le&s;s than the la&s;t was. And thus the quantity of attraction is continually le&s;s and le&s;s the higher we a&s;cend up the hill above the .251999 part, or in round numbers .252 part of the altitude. Let us now de&s;cend, by trying the numbers below .252; and fir&s;t,</P>

<P N="22">22.

<P N="24">24. If <HI>n</HI> &equals; 0, or the point be at the bottom of the

</TABLE> calculations made in the preceding articles; where the fir&s;t column &s;hews at what part of the altitude of the hill the ob&s;ervation is made; the &s;econd column contains the corre&s;ponding numbers which are proportional to the attraction; and the third column &s;hews what part of the greate&s;t attraction is lo&s;t at each re&s;pective place of ob&s;ervation, or how much each is le&s;s than the greate&s;t.</P>
<P N="26">26. Having now &s;o fully illu&s;trated the ca&s;e of the fir&s;t extreme, or limit, let us &s;earch what is the limit for the other extreme, that is, when the hill is very low or flat. In this ca&s;e <HI>b</HI> is nearly equal to <HI>d,</HI> and they are both very great in re&s;pect of <HI>a;</HI> con&s;equently the for|mula for the attraction in Art. 10, will become barely <GAP DESC="math">; the fluxion of which being put &equals; 0, we obtain <GAP DESC="math">; hence therefore <GAP DESC="math">, and <GAP DESC="math">.
<PB N="16" REF="16" MS="y">Which &s;hews that the other limit is 29/100; that is, when the hill is extremely low, the point of great|e&s;t attraction is at 29/100 of the altitude, like as it is at 25/100 when the hill is very &s;teep. And between the&s;e limits it is always found, it being nearer to the one or the other of them, as the hill is flatter or &s;teeper.</P>
<P N="27">27. Thus then we find that at &frac14; of the altitude, or very little more, is the be&s;t place for ob&s;ervation, to have the greate&s;t attraction from a hill in the form of a tri|angular pri&s;m of an indefinite length. But when its length is limited, the point of greate&s;t attraction will de&s;cend a little lower; and the &s;horter the hill is, the lower will that point de&s;cend. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, all pyramidal hills have their place of greate&s;t attraction a little below that above determined. But if the hill have a con&s;iderable &s;pace flat at the top, after the manner of a fru&s;tum, then the &s;aid point will be a little higher than as above found. Commonly, however, &frac14; of the altitude may be u&s;ed for the be&s;t place of ob&s;ervation, as the point of greate&s;t attraction will &s;eldom differ &s;en&s;ibly from that place. And when uncommon circum&s;tances may produce a difference too great to be intirely neglect|ed, the ob&s;erver mu&s;t exerci&s;e his judgment in gue&s;&s;ing at the nece&s;&s;ary change he ought to make in the place of ob&s;ervation, &s;o as to obtain the be&s;t effect which the concomitant circum&s;tances will admit of.</P>
