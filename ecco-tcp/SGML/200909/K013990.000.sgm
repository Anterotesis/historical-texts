<HEAD>THE INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>LONG Life is one of the greate&s;t Ble&s;&s;ings, that we Mortals can enjoy; it being what all Men naturally de&s;ire and wi&s;h for. Nay when Men are come to the longe&s;t Date, they de|&s;ire yet to live a little longer. But however, Health is that which &s;weetens all our other Enjoyments, without which the longe&s;t Life would be no more than a living Death, and render us burden&s;om to our&s;elves, and trouble|&s;om to all about us.</P>
<P>But tho' Life be &s;o de&s;irous, and Health &s;o great a Ble&s;&s;ing, yet how much is both the one and the other un|dervalued by the greate&s;t Part of Man|kind? Whatever they may think or
<PB REF="9">&s;ay of the Ine&s;timablene&s;s of tho&s;e precious Jewels; yet it is plain by their Practice, that they put the Slight upon, and de&s;pi&s;e them both; and mo&s;t Men are hardly &s;en&s;ible of the Worth of Health, till they come in good ear|ne&s;t to be deprived of it.</P>
<P>How many Men do we daily &s;ee who, by their Intemperance and Exce&s;s, lay the Seeds of future Di&s;tempers, which either carry them off in the Flower of their Age, which is the Ca&s;e of mo&s;t, or el&s;e render their old Age, if they arrive to it, unea&s;y and uncomfortable? And tho' we &s;ee others daily drop into the Grave before us, and are very apt, with Ju&s;tice, to a&s;cribe the lo&s;s of our Friends to their living too fa&s;t; yet we cannot forbear trading in the &s;ame Steps, and following the &s;ame Cour&s;es, till at la&s;t, by a violent and unnatural Death, we are hurried off the Stage of Life af|ter them.</P>
<P>What the noble <HI>Cornaro</HI> ob&s;erves of the <HI>Italians</HI> of his time, may very well be applied to this Nation at pre&s;ent,
<PB REF="10"><HI>viz.</HI> <Q>That we are not contented with a plain Bill of Fare; that we ran&s;ack the Elements of Earth, Air, and Water, for all Sorts of Creatures to gratifie our wanton and luxurious Appetites: That, as if our Tables were too narrow and &s;hort to hold our Provi&s;ions, we heap them up upon one another. And la&s;tly, that, to create a fal&s;e Appetite, we rack our Cook's Inventions for new Sauces and Provocatives, to make the &s;uper|fluous Mor&s;el go down with the greater Gu&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>This is not a groundle&s;s Ob&s;erva|tion, but it carries an experimental Conviction along with it. Look into all our publick Entertainments and Fea&s;ts, and &s;ee whether Luxury and Intemperance be not too predominant in them. Men upon &s;uch Occa&s;ions think it ju&s;tifiable to give them&s;elves the Loo&s;e to eat heartily, and to drink deep|ly; and many think them&s;elves not welcome or well entertained, if the Ma&s;ter of the Fea&s;t be &s;o wi&s;e as not
<PB REF="11">to give them an Occa&s;ion of lo&s;ing the MAN, and a&s;&s;uming the BEAST.</P>
<P>In Oppo&s;ition to &s;uch a Practice, and to &s;hew the good Effects of a &s;ober and regular Life, was the De&s;ign of <HI>Cor|naro</HI> in writing the en&s;uing Treati&s;e, as is al&s;o ours in handing it into the World in an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Dre&s;s. What he wrote was from his own Experience, and he felt the Benefit of that Regimen which he pre&s;cribes to others; and they may meet with the &s;ame Succe&s;s, if with Prudence and Caution they apply it to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>It cannot indeed be expected that eve|ry Man &s;hould tye him&s;elf up &s;trictly to the Ob&s;ervation of the &s;ame Rules in his Diet, as this noble <HI>Venetian</HI> follow|ed; &s;ince the Variety of Climates, Con|&s;titution, Age, and other Circum&s;tan|ces may admit of great Variations. But this we may a&s;&s;ert as a rea&s;onable, ge|neral, and undeniable Maxim, founded upon Rea&s;on and the Nature of Things; That, for the Pre&s;ervation of Health, and the Prolonging a Man's Life, it is
<PB REF="12">nece&s;&s;ary that he eat and drink no more than what is &s;ufficient to &s;upport his na|tural Con&s;titution: and on the contrary, what&s;oever he eats or drinks beyond that is &s;uperfluous, and tends to the feeding of the corrupt and vicious Hu|mours, which will at la&s;t, tho' they may be &s;tifled for a time, break out in|to a Flame, and burn the Man quite down, or el&s;e leave him a ruined and &s;hattered Building.</P>
<P>This general Maxim, which we have laid down, will hold good with Re&s;pect to Men of all Ages and Con&s;titutions, and under what&s;oever Climate they live; if they have but the Courage to make a due Application of it, and to lay a Re&s;traint upon their unrea&s;onable Appetites.</P>
<P>After all, we will not, we dare not warrant, that the mo&s;t &s;trict and &s;ober Life will &s;ecure a Man from all Di&s;ea&s;es, or prolong his Days to that Age which <HI>Signior Cornaro</HI> promi&s;es them by his own Experience. Natural Infirmities and Weakne&s;&s;es which a Man brings
<PB REF="13">along with him into the World, which he derived from his Parents, and could not avoid, may make him &s;ickly and unhealthful, notwith&s;tanding all his Care and Precaution; and outward Ac|cidents (from which no Man is free) may cut the Thread of Life before it be half &s;pun out. There is no fen|cing again&s;t the latter of the&s;e; but as to the former, a Man may in &s;ome Mea|&s;ure correct and amend them by a &s;ober and regular Life. In fine, let a Man's Life be longer or &s;horter, yet Sobriety and Temperance render it plea&s;ant and delightful. One that is &s;ober, tho' he lives but thirty or forty Years, yet lives long, and enjoys all his Days, having a free and clear u&s;e of all his Faculties: Whil&s;t the Man that gives him&s;elf up to Exce&s;s, and lays no Re&s;traint upon his Appetites, tho' he prolongs his Days to three or four&s;core Years (which is next to a Miracle) yet is his Life but one continued do&s;ing Slumber; his Head being always full of Fumes; the Powers of his Soul cloudy and dark; the Or|gans
<PB REF="14">of his Body weak and worn out; and neither of them fit to di&s;charge the proper Offices of a rational Creature.</P>
<P>Now let any one, upon &s;erious Re|flection, con&s;ider which is mo&s;t eligible, a &s;ober and regular, or an intemperate and di&s;orderly Cour&s;e of Life. Cer|tainly there is no great Difficulty in de|termining this Que&s;tion; the main Bu|&s;ine&s;s is to per&s;uade Men to put into Practice what they are really in their own Con&s;ciences convinced to be ne|ce&s;&s;ary for them to do. And this might ea&s;ily be done, were not Men born down, even again&s;t their own Senti|ments, by Prejudice, Cu&s;tom and Ex|ample. It is therefore requi&s;ite, in or|der to the farther recommending of So|briety, to take off and an&s;wer &s;ome Objections, (not taken Notice of by <HI>Cornaro</HI>) which &s;ome in our Days make u&s;e of to ju&s;tifie their contrary Practice.</P>
<P>Some of the Wits of the Age tell us, <Q>that Wine; even drunk to Exce&s;s, enlivens the Fancy, and infu&s;es bold and great Thoughts into a Man,
<PB REF="15">makes his Writings bri&s;k and airy, a Plea&s;ure to him&s;elf, and no le&s;s de|lightful to others; whil&s;t others pre|tend Sobriety makes them dull and flat in all their Performances, and nothing but what is phlegmatick and heavy is the Product of their Genius.</Q></P>
<P>In an&s;wer to this, it may be &s;aid, that this their A&s;&s;ertion is apparently fal&s;e. What the Effects of the&s;e Spi|rits of Wine and a heated Brain have been, and how much the modern Wits have improved by &s;uch a Method, is evident by the many loo&s;e and pro|fane Plays and Poems, which they have of late Years publi&s;hed. There is indeed in them a Fla&s;hine&s;s, Sprightli|ne&s;s, and an unu&s;ual Boldne&s;s of Thought, even to the out-braving and ridiculing of all that is good and &s;acred. But call you this refined Wit? No, it is Fool-hardine&s;s, Profanene&s;s and Bla&s;phemy, &s;uch as would &s;tartle a &s;ober Man to hear or read, and would even make the Authors them&s;elves to blu&s;h, were they not arrived to &s;uch a
<PB REF="16">Degree of Impudence, <HI>as not to be a&s;ha|med.</HI> The very Air of tho&s;e Writings informs you, that they were drawn off from the <HI>Lees of Wine:</HI> That a de|bauched and licentious Conver&s;ation gave them their Ideas of Men and Manners, &s;o forced, mon&s;truous, and &s;hocking to Nature. Be&s;ides, take tho&s;e witty Men out of their own Way, and they are as dull and heavy as any other Animals. Witne&s;s tho&s;e paltry Defences, which have hitherto been made for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Stage, in Oppo|&s;ition to Mr <HI>Collier's</HI> View: Wherein the Poets have wretchedly betrayed their Cau&s;e, and the Force of Wit and Wine has not been able to with&s;tand a &s;ober and &s;olid Argument. But the Ca&s;e is not &s;o with Men who ob&s;erve a due Regimen in what they eat or drink. Whatever the Wits may fal&s;ely repre|&s;ent, yet we may venture to a&s;&s;ert, that the be&s;t Di&s;cour&s;es which have appear|ed in Print upon pious, rational and no|ble Subjects, have been the Product of cool, calm and &s;ober Thoughts. No
<PB REF="17">Heat, no Fla&s;h, but true and &s;olid Ar|guments appear in them; and how un|plea&s;ant and dull &s;oever they may &s;eem to &s;ome of a vitiated and prejudiced Temper of Mind, yet by the wi&s;er Part of Mankind, on who&s;e Judgment one ought chiefly to rely, they will be always had in ju&s;t Re&s;pect and E&s;teem.</P>
<P>'Tis further urged by &s;ome others, who have ab&s;olutely abandoned them|&s;elves to &s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ures: <Q>That 'tis better to live a few Years in the full Enjoyment of the good things of this World, than to &s;pend a Century in a continual Re&s;traint laid upon their Appetites.</Q> But the extravagancy of the&s;e Men appears at fir&s;t View; <HI>eat, drink, and be merry,</HI> is all they aim at, and they do not care how &s;oon their Souls &s;hall be required of them: They are Strangers to the Plea&s;ures which Health and good old Age can afford Men, and therefore live a-pace, tho' in truth they do not live at all to any Purpo&s;e. By their Exce&s;&s;es and Extravagancies they render them&s;elves u&s;ele&s;s to them&s;elves
<PB REF="18">and others. They are always in a Ferment, and never come to cool and &s;edate Thoughts of Things. Hence it was, that a noble<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E. of Roche&s;ter.</NOTE> Peer of this King|dom, one of a large Genius and quick Parts, was hurried by an intemperate &s;ort of Life to &s;uch Extravagancies, as for &s;everal Years not to be his own Man; and tho' he lived not half the Age of a Man, yet by his Exce&s;&s;es he did not enjoy the Half of tho&s;e Days wherein he lived. He perverted tho&s;e Parts which God had given him, and made them the Pandars to Vice and Debauchery; which occa&s;ioned a noble Friend of his to reflect upon him in the&s;e Words:
<Q><L>Such nau&s;eous Songs by a late Author made,</L>
<L>Draw an unwilling Cen&s;ure on his Shade.</L>
<L>Not that warm Thoughts of the tran&s;porting Joy</L>
<L>Can &s;hock the cha&s;te&s;t, or the nice&s;t cloy;</L>
<L>But Words ob&s;cene, too gro&s;s to move De&s;ire,</L>
<L>Like Heaps of Fuel, only choak the Fire.</L>
<BIBL><HI>Marquis of</HI> Noamanby<HI>'s E&s;&s;ay on Poetry.</HI></BIBL></Q></P>
<P><PB REF="19">The late ingenious Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> has in his Spectators more than once treated on this Subject; particularly in <HI>No.</HI> 195. he has given us a very noble and ele|gant Apology in Favours of Tempe|rance, which, as the Argument is the &s;ame, and that it contains a &s;hort Ac|count of the Author <HI>Cornaro,</HI> and a commendable Character of the Treati&s;e it&s;elf, we &s;hall here beg Leave to &s;ub|join to this Introduction.</P>
<Q><L>Fools, not to know that half exceeds the whole,</L>
<L>Nor the great Ble&s;&s;ings of a frugal Board!</L></Q>
<P>THERE is a Story, in the <HI>Arabian Nights Tales,</HI> of a King who had long langui&s;hed under an ill Habit of Body, and had taken Abundance of Remedies to no Purpo&s;e. At length, &s;ays the Fable, a Phy&s;ician cured him by the following Method: He took an hollow Ball of Wood, and filled it with &s;everal Drugs; after which he clo&s;ed it up &s;o artificially that nothing appeared. He likewi&s;e took a Mall, and after ha|ving
<PB REF="20">hollowed the Handle, and that Part which &s;trikes the Ball, he inclo&s;ed in them &s;everal Drugs after the &s;ame Manner as in the Ball it&s;elf. He then ordered the Sultan, who was his Patient, to exerci&s;e him&s;elf early in the Morning with the&s;e rightly prepared In&s;truments, till &s;uch Time as he &s;hould &s;weat: when, as the Story goes, the Virtue of the Medicaments per&s;piring through the Wood, had &s;o good an Influence on the Sultan's Con&s;titution, that they cured him of an Indi&s;po&s;ition which all the Compo&s;itions he had ta|ken inwardly had not been able to re|move. This ea&s;tern Allegory is finely contrived to &s;hew us how beneficial bodily Labour is to Health, and that Exerci&s;e is the mo&s;t effectual Phy&s;ick. I have de&s;cribed in my hundred and fifteenth Paper, from the general Struc|ture and Mechani&s;m of an human Body, how ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary Exerci&s;e is for its Pre&s;ervation: I &s;hall in this Place recommend another great Pre&s;ervative of Health, which in many Ca&s;es pro|duces
<PB REF="21">the &s;ame Effects as Exerci&s;e, and may, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, &s;upply its Place, where Opportunities of Exerci&s;e are wanting. The Pre&s;ervative I am &s;peak|ing of is Temperance, which has tho&s;e particular Advantages above all other Means of Health, that it may be prac|ti&s;ed by all Ranks and Conditions, at any Sea&s;on or in any Place. It is a Kind of Regimen into which every Man may put him&s;elf, without Interruption to Bu&s;in&eacute;&s;s, Expence of Money, or Lo&s;s of Time. If Exerci&s;e throws off all Superfluities, Temperance prevents them; if Exerci&s;e clears the Ve&s;&s;els, Temperance neither &s;atiates nor over|&s;trains them; if Exerci&s;e rai&s;es proper Ferments in the Humours, and pro|motes the Circulation of the Blood, Temperance gives Nature her full Play, and enables her to exert her&s;elf in all her Force and Vigour; if Exerci&s;e di&s;|&s;ipates a growing Di&s;temper, Tempe|rance &s;tarves it.</P>
<P>PHYSICK, for the mo&s;t Part, is no|thing el&s;e but the Sub&s;titute of Exer|ci&s;e
<PB REF="22">or Temperance. Medicines are indeed ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in acute Di&s;tempers, that cannot wait the &s;low Operations of the&s;e two great In&s;tru|ments of Health; but did Men live in an habitual Cour&s;e of Exerci&s;e and Tem|perance, there would be but little Oc|ca&s;ion for them. Accordingly we find that tho&s;e Parts of the World are the mo&s;t healthy, where they &s;ub&s;i&s;t by the Chace; and that Men lived long|e&s;t when their Lives were employed in hunting, and when they had little Food be&s;ides what they caught. Bli|&s;tering, cupping, bleeding, are &s;eldom of U&s;e but to the idle and intemperate; as all tho&s;e inward Applications which are &s;o much in Practice among us, are for the mo&s;t Part, nothing el&s;e but Ex|pedients to make Luxury con&s;i&s;tent with Health. The Apothecary is per|petually employed in countermining the Cook and the Vintner. It is &s;aid of <HI>Diogenes,</HI> that, meeting a young Man who was going to a Fea&s;t, he took him up in the Street, and carried him
<PB REF="23">home to his Friends, as one who was running into imminent Danger, had he not prevented him. What would that Philo&s;opher have &s;aid, had he been pre&s;ent at the Gluttony of a modern Meal? Would not he have thought the Ma&s;ter of a Family mad, and have begged his Servants to tie down his Hands, had he &s;een him devour Fowl, Fi&s;h and Fle&s;h; &s;wallow Oil and Vin|egar, Wines and Spices; throw down Salads of twenty different Herbs, Sau|ces of an hundred Ingredients, Con|fections and Fruits of numberle&s;s Sweets and Flavours? What unnatural Moti|ons and Counter-ferments mu&s;t &s;uch a Medly of Intemperance produce in the Body? For my Part, when I behold a fa&s;hionable Table &s;et out in all its Mag|nificence, I fancy that I &s;ee Gouts and Drop&s;ies, Fevers and Lethargies, with other innumerable Di&s;tempers, lying in Ambu&s;cade among the Di&s;hes.</P>
<P>NATURE delights in the mo&s;t plain and &s;imple Diet. Every Animal, but Man; keeps to one Di&s;h. Herbs are
<PB REF="24">the Food of this Species, Fi&s;h of that, and Fle&s;h of a third. Man falls upon every thing that comes in his Way; not the &s;malle&s;t Fruit or Excre&s;cence of the Earth, &s;carce a Berry, or a Mu&s;hroom, can e&s;cape him.</P>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible to lay down any de|terminate Rule for Temperance, be|cau&s;e what is Luxury in one may be Temperance in another; but there are few that have lived any Time in the World, who are not Judges of their own Con&s;titutions, &s;o far as to know what Kinds and what Proportions of Food do be&s;t agree with them. Were I to con&s;ider my Readers as my Pati|ents, and to pre&s;cribe &s;uch a Kind of Temperance as is accommodated to all Per&s;ons, and &s;uch as is particularly &s;uit|able to our Climate and Way of living, I would copy the following Rules of a very eminent Phy&s;ician. Make your whole Repa&s;t out of one Di&s;h. If you indulge in a &s;econd, avoid drinking any thing &s;trong, till you have fini&s;hed your Meal; at the &s;ame Time ab&s;tain from
<PB REF="25">than &s;ixty Years of Age, at the Time of their re&s;pective Deaths. But the mo&s;t re|markable In&s;tance of the Efficacy of Tem|perance towards the procuring of long Life, is what we meet with in a little Book pub|li&s;hed by <HI>Lewis Cornaro</HI> the <HI>Venetian;</HI> which I the rather mention, becau&s;e it is of un|doubted Credit, as the late <HI>Venetian</HI> Am|ba&s;&s;ador, who was of the &s;ame Family, at|te&s;ted more than once in Conver&s;ation, when he re&s;ided in England. <HI>Cornaro,</HI> who was the Author of the little Treati&s;e I am men|tioning, was of an infirm Con&s;titution, till about forty; when, by ob&s;tinately per|&s;i&s;ting in an exact Cour&s;e of Temperance, he recovered a perfect State of Health; in|&s;omuch, that at four&s;core he publi&s;hed nis Book, which has been tran&s;lated into Eng|li&s;h under the Title of <HI>&s;ure Methods of at|taining a long and healthful Life.</HI> He lived to give a 3d or 4th Edition of it, and, after ha|ving pa&s;&s;ed his hundredth Year, died without Pain or Agony, and like one who falls a|&s;leep. The Treati&s;e I mention has been taken Notice of by &s;everal eminent Au|thors, and is written with &s;uch a Spirit of Chearfulne&s;s, Religion and good Sen&s;e, as are the natural Concomitants of Tempe|rance and Sobriety. The Mixture of the old Man in it is rather a Recommendation than a Di&s;credit to it.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of a Sober and Regular <HI>LIFE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>NOTHING is more certain than that Cu&s;tom becomes a &s;econd Nature, and has a great Influ|ence upon our Bodies. Nay, it has too often more Power over the Mind, than Rea&s;on it&s;elf. The hone&s;te&s;t Man a|live, in keeping Company with Liber|tines, by degrees forgets the Maxims of Probity which he had imbibed from the very Brea&s;t, and gives him&s;elf the Loo&s;e in tho&s;e Vices which he &s;ees prac|ti&s;ed.
<PB N="2" REF="27">If he be &s;o happy as to relin|qui&s;h that bad Company, and to meet with Better, Virtue will triumph in its Turn; and he in&s;en&s;ibly re&s;umes the Wi&s;dom which he had abandoned. In a Word, all the Alterations which we perceive in the Temper, Carriage, and Manners of mo&s;t Men, have &s;carce any other Foundation but the Force and Prevalency of Cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erved that it is Cu&s;tom which has given ri&s;e to two very dan|gerous Evils within a little Time in <HI>Ita|ly;</HI> the fir&s;t I reckon to be Flattery and Ceremonies; and the &s;econd, Intem|perance both in Eating and Drinking.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e bani&s;hes out of hu|man Conver&s;ation all Plain-dealing, Frankne&s;s and Sincerity: And again&s;t the latter I declare open War, as being the mo&s;t de&s;tructive of <HI>Health</HI> and the great|e&s;t Enemy it has.</P>
<P>'Tis an unhappine&s;s into which the Men of this Age are fallen, that Variety of Di&s;hes is a-la-mode, and become &s;o far preferable to Frugality. And yet
<PB N="3" REF="28">the One is the Product of Temperance; while&s;t Pride and an unre&s;trained Appe|tite is the Parent of the other. Notwith|&s;tanding the difference of their Origin, yet Prodigality is at pre&s;ent &s;tiled Mag|nificence, Genero&s;ity and Grandeur, and is commonly e&s;teemed of in the World; whil&s;t Frugality-pa&s;&s;es for A|varice, and Sordidne&s;s Spirit in the Eyes of mo&s;t Men. Here is a vi&s;ible Error which Cu&s;tom and habit have e&s;tabli|&s;hed.</P>
<P>This Error has &s;o far &s;educed us, that it has prevailed upon us to renounce a frugal Way of living, tho' taught us by Nature even from the fir&s;t Age of the World, as being that which would pro|long our days; and has ca&s;t us into tho&s;e Exce&s;&s;es which &s;erve only to abridge the Number of them. We become Old before we have been able to ta&s;te the Plea&s;ure of being Young; and the Time which ought to be the Summer of our Lives, is often the beginning of their Winter. We &s;oon perceive our &s;trength to fail, and Weakne&s;s to come on a-pace,
<PB N="4" REF="29">and decline even before we come to Perfection. On the contrary, Sobriety maintains us in the natural State where|in. we ought to be; Our Youth is la&s;t|ing, and our Manhood attended with a Vigour that does not begin to decay till after a great many Years. A whole Century mu&s;t be run out before Wrinkles can be formed on the Face, or gray Hairs grow on the Head. This is &s;o true, that when Men were not addic|ted to Voluptou&s;ne&s;s, they had more Strength and Vivacity at four&s;core, than we have at pre&s;ent at forty.</P>
<P>O unhappy <HI>Italy!</HI> Do&s;t thou not per|ceive that Gluttony and Exce&s;s robs thee every Year of more Inhabitants than Pe&s;tilence, War and Famine could have de&s;troyed? Thy true Plagues are thy frequent Fea&s;tings, which are &s;o extravagant, that no Tables can be made large enough to hold that Number of Di&s;hes which Prodigality lays upon them, but they are forced to be heap'd upon one another in Pyramids. What Madne&s;s, what Fury is this! Regulate
<PB N="5" REF="30">this Di&s;order, if not for God's &s;ake, yet for thy own. I am &s;ure there is no Sin, that di&s;plea&s;es him more, nor any Voluptou&s;ne&s;s that can be more perni|cious to thy&s;elf. Endeavour then to heal thy&s;elf of this, as being one of tho&s;e Epidemical De&s;tempers, from which thou may'&s;t be pre&s;erved by whole&s;om Food, and by the precau|tions that may prevent them. 'Tis very ea&s;y to avoid the Evils which an Exce&s;s in Eating or Drinking may bring upon us; nor is it any hard matter to find out a &s;overeign Remedy again&s;t Repletion, &s;ince Nature it&s;elf has taught us it. Let us only give it what it requires, and not overcharge it; for a &s;mall matter &s;uffi|ces Nature. The Rules of Tempe|rence are derived from tho&s;e of right Rea&s;on. Let us accu&s;tom our&s;elves to eat only to &s;upport Life; what is more than nece&s;&s;ary for our Nouri&s;hment &s;ows the Seeds of Sickne&s;s and Death; 'tis a Plea&s;ure for which we mu&s;t pay very dear, and which can neither be inno|cent
<PB N="6" REF="31">nor excu&s;able, &s;ince it mu&s;t be &s;o prejudicial to us.</P>
<P>How many have I &s;een cut off in the Flower of their Days by the unhappy Cu&s;tom of high Feeding? How many excellent Friends has Gluttony deprived me of, who might have been &s;till an Ornament to the World, an Honour to their Country, and have occa&s;ioned me as much Satisfaction in enjoying them, as now I have Sorrow in lo&s;ing them?</P>
<P>'Tis to put a &s;top to this &s;preading Contagion that I have undertaken to &s;hew in this &s;mall Tract, that the Num|ber and Variety of Di&s;hes is a fatal A|bu&s;e which ought to be corrected, by living &s;oberly, as did the Patriarchs of old. Several young Per&s;ons, who for their good Qualities merit my E&s;teem, having lo&s;t their Fathers &s;ooner than they could have expected, have expre&s;|&s;ed a great De&s;ire of being acquainted with my Manner of Living. I could not but think their Curio&s;ity very rea&s;onable, &s;ince Nothing is more rea&s;onable than
<PB N="7" REF="32">to wi&s;h for long Life. The more we advance in Years the larger will our Ex|perience be; and if Nature, which aims only at our Good, advi&s;es us to grow old, and concurs with us in that De|&s;ign, it is becau&s;e &s;he is &s;en&s;ible that the Body being weakned by Time, which de&s;troys all things, the Mind, when di&s;engaged from the Snares of Voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, is more at lei&s;ure to make u&s;e of its Rea&s;on, and to ta&s;te the Sweets of Virtue. Hereupon I was willing to &s;atisfie tho&s;e Per&s;ons, and at the &s;ame Time to do &s;ome Service to the Publick, by declaring what were the Motives that induced me to renounce Intempe|rance, and live a &s;ober Life; by &s;hew|ing the Method I ob&s;erve, and what Benefit I find thereby; and la&s;tly, by demon&s;trating that nothing can be more bene&s;icial to a Man, than to ob&s;erve a Regimen, that it is practicable and ve|ry nece&s;&s;ary to be followed.</P>
<P>I &s;ay then, that the weakne&s;s of my Con&s;titution, which was con&s;iderably increas'd by my Way of Living, ca&s;t
<PB N="8" REF="33">me into &s;o deplorable a Condition, that I was forced to bid a final Adieu to all Fea&s;tings, to which I had all my Life long a violent Inclination. I was &s;o often engaged in Exce&s;&s;es of this kind, that my tender Con&s;titution could not hold up under the Fatigues of them. I fell into &s;everal Di&s;tempers, &s;uch as Pains of the Stomach, the Cholick, and the Gout. I had a lingring Fever, and an intolerable Thir&s;t continually hanging upon me. This made me di&s;pair of any Cure, and tho' I was then not a|bove 35 or 40 Years Old, yet I had no Hopes of finding any other end of my Di&s;tempers, but what &s;hould end my Life too.</P>
<P>The be&s;t Phy&s;icians in <HI>Italy</HI> made u&s;e of all their Skill for my Recovery, but without Succe&s;s. At la&s;t when they quite de&s;pair'd of me, they told me that they knew only of one Remedy that could cure me, if I had Re&s;olution e|nough to undertake and continue it, to wit, a &s;ober and regular Life, which they exhorted me to live the Re|mainder
<PB N="9" REF="34">of my Days, a&s;&s;uring me, that if Intemperance had brought &s;o many Di&s;tempers, it was only Temperance that could free me from them.</P>
<P>I reli&s;h'd this Propo&s;al; and percei|ved that notwith&s;tanding the mi&s;erable Condition to which my Intemperance had reduced me, yet I was not &s;o in|curable, but the contrary might recover or at lea&s;t ea&s;e me. And I was the more ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to it, becau&s;e I knew &s;everal Per&s;ons of a great Age and a bad Con&s;titution, who only prolonged their Lives by ob&s;erving a Regimen, whil&s;t on the other hand I knew others who were born with a wonderful Con&s;titu|tion, and yet broke it by their Debau|cheries. It &s;eem'd very natural to me, that a different Way of living and acting produces different Effects, &s;ince Art may conduce to correct, perfect, weaken or de&s;troy Nature, according to the good or bad U&s;e that is made of it.</P>
<P>The Phy&s;icians beginning to find me tractable, added to what they had before told me, that I mu&s;t either chu&s;e a Re|gimen
<PB N="10" REF="35">or Death; that I could not live if I did not follow their Advice, and that if I deferr'd much longer taking my Re&s;olutions accordingly, it would be too late to do it. This was home; I was loath to die &s;o &s;oon, and I could not tell how to bear the Thoughts of it; be&s;ides, I was convinced of their Ex|perience and Ability. In &s;hort, being morally certain that my be&s;t way was to believe them, I re&s;olved upon put|ting into practice this Cour&s;e of Life, how au&s;tere &s;oever it &s;eem'd to me.</P>
<P>I entreated my Phy&s;icians to inform me exactly after what Manner I ought to govern my&s;elf. To this they reply'd, that I mu&s;t always manage my&s;elf as a &s;ick Per&s;on, eat nothing but what was good, and that in a &s;mall Quantity.</P>
<P>They had a long time before per&s;crib|ed the &s;ame Thing to me; but till then I made a Je&s;t of it. When I was cloy'd with the Diet they order'd me I did eat of all tho&s;e Meats which they had for|bidden, and perceiving my&s;elf hot and dry, I drank Wine in abundance. How|ever,
<PB N="11" REF="36">I do not boa&s;t of this my Con|duct; I was one of tho&s;e imprudent Patients, who not being able to re&s;olve upon doing whatever is pre&s;cribed them for their Health, mind nothing el&s;e but deceiving their Phy&s;icians, tho' they prove the greate&s;t Cheats to them&s;elves at la&s;t.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I re&s;olved to believe my Phy&s;icians, and thought that it was a di&s;grace not to have Courage enough to be wi&s;e; I accu&s;tomed my&s;elf &s;o much to live &s;oberly, that I contracted a Ha|bit of &s;o doing, without any Trouble or Violence offered to my&s;elf. In a little Time I found Relief, and (which may &s;eem to &s;ome incredible) at the Year's End I found my&s;elf not only on the mending hand, but I was perfectly cured of all my Di&s;tempers.</P>
<P>When I &s;aw I was recovered, and began to ta&s;te the Sweets of this &s;ort of Re&s;urrection, I made abundance of Re|flexions upon the U&s;efulne&s;s of a regu|lar Life. I admired the Efficacy of it, and perceiv'd that if it had been &s;o
<PB N="12" REF="37">powerful as to cure me, it would be capable enough of pre&s;erving me from tho&s;e Di&s;tempers to which I had been always &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The Experience I had thereof re|moving all farther Scruple, I began to &s;tudy what Food was proper for me. I was minded to try whether what plea&s;ed my Ta&s;te were beneficial or pre|prejudicial to my Health, and whether the Proverb were true, which &s;ays, <HI>That what delights the Palate cannot but be good for the Heart:</HI> I found it to be fal&s;e, and that it only &s;erves as an Excu&s;e to the Sen&s;uali&s;ts, who are for indulging them&s;elves in whatever might plea&s;e their Appetites.</P>
<P>Formerly I could not drink my Wine with Ice; I loved heady Wines, Melons, all &s;orts of raw Fruits, Salads, &s;alt Meats, high Sauces and baked Meats, notwith&s;tanding they were prejudicial to me. Hereupon I made no Account of the Proverb, and being convinced of its Fal&s;ity, I made choi&s;e of &s;uch Wines and Meats as agreed with my Con&s;titu|tion
<PB N="13" REF="38">I proportioned the Quantity there|of according to the &s;trength of my Sto|mach. I declined all Diet that did not agree with me; and made it a Law to my&s;elf to lay a re&s;traint upon my Ap|petite, &s;o that I always ro&s;e from Table with a Stomach to eat more if I pleas'd. In a Word I entirely renounced Intem|perance, and made a Vow to continue the Remainder of my Life under the &s;ome Regimen that I had ob&s;erved: A happy Re&s;olution this, the keeping whereof has freed me from all my In|firmities, which without it were Incu|rable! I never before lived a Year to|gether without falling once at lea&s;t in|to &s;ome violent Di&s;temper; but this ne|ver happened to me afterwards; on the Contrary I have been always Health|ful ever &s;ince I have been Temperate. The Nouri&s;hment which I take, being in Quality and Quantity ju&s;t e|nough to &s;uffice Nature, breeds no &s;uch corrupt Humours as &s;poil the be&s;t Con|&s;titutions. 'Tis true indeed, that be|&s;ides this Precaution I made u&s;e of ma|ny
<PB N="14" REF="39">others. For in&s;tance, I took care to keep my&s;elf from Heats and Colds: I ab&s;tained from all violent Exerci&s;es, as al&s;o from ill Hours and Women. I no longer lived in Places where was an unwhole&s;ome Air, and took &s;pecial Care to avoid the being expo&s;ed to violent Winds, or to the exce&s;&s;ive Heat of the Sun. All the&s;e Cautions may &s;eem mo|rally impo&s;&s;ible to tho&s;e Men, who in their Tran&s;actions in the World follow no other Guides but their own Pa&s;&s;ions; and yet they are not hard to be prac|ti&s;ed, when a Man can be &s;o ju&s;t to him&s;elf as to prefer the Pre&s;ervation of his Health to all the Plea&s;ures of Sen&s;e and nece&s;&s;ary Hurry of Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>I likewi&s;e found it advantageous to me not to abandon my&s;elf to Melan|choly, by bani&s;hing out of my Mind whatever might occa&s;ion it: I made u&s;e of all the Powers of my Rea&s;on to re|&s;train the Force of tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions, who&s;e Violence does often break the Con&s;ti|tution of the &s;tronge&s;t Bodies. It is true indeed, that I was not always &s;o
<PB N="15" REF="40">much a Philo&s;opher, nor yet &s;o cau|tious, but that &s;ometimes I fell into tho&s;e Di&s;orders that I would have avoided; but this rarely happened, and the Guard I kept over my Appetite, which ought chiefly to be minded, prevented all the pernicious Con&s;equences which might have ari&s;en from my petty Irregulari|ties.</P>
<P>This is certain, that the Pa&s;&s;ions have le&s;s Influence, and cau&s;e le&s;s Di&s;order in a Body that is regular in its Diet, than in another which gives the loo&s;e to the Cravings of an inordinate Appe|tite. <HI>Galen</HI> made this Ob&s;ervation be|fore me; and I might produce &s;everal Authorities to &s;upport this Opinion, but I will go only upon my own Experi|ence. It was impo&s;&s;ible for me &s;ome|times to ab&s;tain from the Extremes of Hot and Cold, and to get an entire Ma&s;tery over all the Occa&s;ions of Trouble which had cro&s;&s;ed my whole Life; but yet the&s;e Emotions made no Alteration in the State of my Health: And I met with a great many In&s;tances
<PB N="16" REF="41">of Per&s;ons who &s;unk under a le&s;s Weight, both of Body and Mind.</P>
<P>There was in our Family a con&s;ide|rable Suit of Law depending again&s;t &s;ome Per&s;ons, who&s;e Might overcame our Right. One of my Brothers, and &s;ome of my Relations, who having ne|ver &s;marted for their Debauches, were the more free to indulge them, could not conquer that Concern which the Lo&s;s of this Suit of Law wrought in them, and perfectly died of Grief. I was as &s;en&s;ible as they were, of the In|ju&s;tice that was done us, but I did not die for it; and I attribute their Lo&s;s and my Welfare to the Difference in our Way of Living. I was made amends for that Di&s;grace by the Comfort I had of not &s;inking under it; and now make no manner of Doubt, but that the Pa&s;|&s;ions are le&s;s violent in a Man that lives &s;oberly, than in one that does not.</P>
<P>At &s;eventy Years of Age I had ano|ther Experiment of the U&s;efulne&s;s of my Regimen. A Bu&s;ine&s;s of an extra|ordinary Con&s;equence drawing me in|to
<PB N="17" REF="42">to the Country, my Coach-hor&s;es went fa&s;ter then I would have them; being la&s;hed with the Whip, got a head and and ran away with me. I was over|thrown, and dragged a long Way be|fore they could &s;top-the Hor&s;es. They took me out of the Coach, with my Head broken, a Leg and an Arm out of Joint, and in a Word, in a very la|mentable Condition. As &s;oon as they had brought me Home again, they &s;ent for the Phy&s;icians, who did not expect I could live three Days to an end: However, they re&s;olved upon letting of me Blood to prevent the coming of a Fever, which u&s;ually happens in &s;uch Ca&s;es. I was &s;o confident that the re|gular Life which I had led, had pre|vented the contracting of any ill Hu|mours which I might be afraid of, that I oppo&s;ed their Pre&s;cription. I ordered them to dre&s;s my Head, to &s;et my Leg and my Arm, to rub me with &s;ome &s;peci&s;ick Oils proper for Brui&s;es, and without any other Remedies I was &s;oon cured, to the great A&s;toni&s;hment of
<PB N="18" REF="43">the Phy&s;icians, and of all tho&s;e who knew me. From hence I infer, that a regular Life is an excellent Pre&s;ervative again&s;t all natural Evils, and that In|temperance produces quite contrary Ef|fects.</P>
<P>About four Years ago I was over per&s;uaded to do a Thing which had like to have co&s;t me dear. My Relations whom I love, and who have a real Ten|derne&s;s for me; my Friends with whom I was willing to comply in any Thing that was rea&s;onable; la&s;tly, my Phy&s;i|cians who were look'd upon as the O|racles of Health did all agree, that I eat too little; that the Nouri&s;hment I took was not &s;ufficient for one of my Years; that I ought not only to &s;up|port Nature, but likewi&s;e to increa&s;e the Vigour of it by eating a little more than I did. It was in vain for me to repre&s;ent to them, that Nature is con|tent with a little; that this Little having pre&s;erved me &s;o long in Health, Cu&s;tom was become a &s;econd Nature to me: That it was more rea&s;onable, &s;ince Na|tural
<PB N="19" REF="44">Heat abates in proportion as one grows older, that I &s;hould likewi&s;e a|bridge my Allowance in Diet.</P>
<P>To add the greater Force to my O|pinion, I mentioned to them the Pro|verb which &s;aith, <HI>He that &ecirc;ats little, eats much;</HI> that is, if a Man is willing to live long in the enjoyment of his Food let him live &s;paringly. I likewi&s;e told them, that what One leaves at a Meal does One more good, than what One has already eaten. But all this could not prevail upon them; and being wearied with their importunities, I was forced to &s;ubmit. Having therfore be|fore been u&s;ed to take twelve Ounces, in Bread, Soops, Yolks of Eggs, and Meat, I encrea&s;ed it to fourteen Ounces a Day; and drinking about fourteen Ounces of Wine, I added two Ounces more, and made it &s;ixteen.</P>
<P>This Augmentation of Diet was &s;o prejudicial to me, that as bri&s;k as I was, I began to be &s;ad and out of Humour; every Thing offended me, and upon the lea&s;t Occa&s;ion I broke out into a
<PB N="20" REF="45">Pa&s;&s;ion, &s;o that a Dog (as they &s;ay) would not live with me. At twelve Days end I was taken with a violent Fit of the Gholick, and that followed by a continual Fever, which tormen|ted me five and thirty Days together, and for the fir&s;t fifteen Days put me in|to &s;uch an Agony, that it was impo&s;|&s;ible for me to take a Quarter of an Hours &s;leep at a Time. There was no Occa&s;ion to a&s;k my Friends whether they di&s;paired of my Life, and whether they repented of the advice they had given me; for they &s;everal times be|lieved that I was a dying Man, ju&s;t giving up the Gho&s;t. However I re|covered tho' I was &s;eventy eight Years of Age, and tho' we had a harder Win|ter than is u&s;ual in our Climate.</P>
<P>Nothing freed me from this Danger, but the Regimen which I had &s;o long ob&s;erved. It had prevented me from contracting tho&s;e ill Humours, with which they are troubled in their old Age, who are not &s;o wi&s;e as to take care of them&s;elves whil&s;t they are
<PB N="21" REF="46">Young. I did not perceive in me the old Leaven of tho&s;e Humours, and ha|ving nothing to &s;truggle with but the new ones, which were occa&s;ioned by this &s;mall Addition to my Diet, I op|po&s;ed and conquered my Inditpo&s;ition notwith&s;tanding its force.</P>
<P>From this Sickne&s;s, and my Reco|very from it, we may di&s;cern, what an Influence a Regimen has over us, which pre&s;erved me from Death, and what a Power Repletion has, which in &s;o few Days brought me to the la&s;t Ex|tremity. 'Tis probable that Order being nece&s;&s;ary for the Con&s;ervation of the Univer&s;e, and our Bodily Life be|ing nothing el&s;e but a Harmony and perfect Agreement between the Ele|mentary Qualities of which our Bodies are compo&s;ed, we cannot live long in a di&s;orderly Cour&s;e of Life, of which nothing but Corruption can po&s;&s;ibly come.</P>
<P>Order indeed is &s;o exceeding Bene|ficial, that it cannot be too &s;trictly ob|&s;erved in every thing. 'Tis by the
<PB N="22" REF="47">Means of this that we arrive to the per|fection of Arts, and an ea&s;y accom|pli&s;hent in the Sciences. It renders Armies victorious, keeps up the civil Polity of Cities, and Concord in Fami|lies: It renders whole Nations flouri&s;h|ing; in a word, it is the &s;upport and pre&s;erver both of the civil and natural Life; and the be&s;t Remedy that can be applied to all Evils, whether publick or private.</P>
<P>When a di&s;intere&s;ted Phy&s;ician waits upon a Patient, let him remember to recommend to him his Diet; and e&s;pe|cially a Regimen therein in order to his Recovery. This is certain, that if all Men would live regularly and frugaly, there would be &s;o few &s;ick Per&s;ons, that there would be hardly any occa|&s;ion for Remedies; every one would become his own <HI>Phy&s;ician,</HI> and would be convinced that he never met with a better. It would be to little purpo&s;e to &s;tudy the Con&s;titution of other Men; every one if he would but apply him|&s;elf to it, would always be better ac|quainted
<PB N="23" REF="48">with his own, than with that of another; every one would be cap|able of making tho&s;e Experiments for him&s;elf, which another could not do for him, and would be the be&s;t judge of the Strength of his own Stomach, and of the Food which is agreable thereto; for in one word, 'tis next to impo&s;&s;ible to know exactly the Con|&s;titution of another, the Con&s;titutions of Men being as different from one a|nother as their Complexions. Who now for in&s;tance, would imagine that old Wine &s;hould be hurtful, and new Wine whol&s;ome to me? That Things which are looked upon to be hot by Nature &s;hould refre&s;h and &s;trengthen me? What Phy&s;ician could have ob&s;er|ved in me tho&s;e Effects &s;o uncommon in mo&s;t Bodies, and &s;o contrary to the Notions of mankind, when I my&s;elf was at no &s;mall Pains in di&s;covering the Cau&s;es thereof after abundance of Trials, which prove the Difference of Mens Con&s;titutions?</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="49">Since no Man therefore can have a better Phy&s;ician than him&s;elf, nor a more &s;overeign Antidote than a Regi|men, every one ought to follow my Example; that is, to &s;tudy his own Con&s;titution, and to regulate his Life according to the Rules of right Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>I own indeed that a Phy&s;ician may be &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary; &s;ince there are &s;ome Di&s;tempers which all human Prudence cannot provide again&s;t. There happen &s;ome unavoidable Acci|dents, which &s;eize us after &s;uch a man|ner as to deprive our Judgment of the Liberty it ought to have to be a Com|fort to us. It is fooli&s;hne&s;s then whol|ly to rely upon Nature, it mu&s;t have a &s;upply, and recour&s;e mu&s;t be had to &s;ome one or other for it.</P>
<P>If the pre&s;ence of a <HI>Friend</HI> who comes <HI>to vi&s;it a &s;ick Per&s;on</HI> and to te&s;ti|fie the Concern he has for his Illne&s;s, be a Comfort and Refre&s;hment to him; there is greater Rea&s;on to believe that the Vi&s;it of a Phy&s;ician mu&s;t needs be more agrecable, being a Friend upon
<PB N="25" REF="50">who&s;e Advi&s;e and we may depend for a &s;peedy Recovery of our Health; but for the Maintaining of that Health there needs no other Support but a &s;ober and regular Life. 'Tis a Specifick and na|tural Medicine, which pre&s;erves the Man, how tender &s;oever his Con&s;titu|tion be, and prolongs his Life to above a hundred Years, &s;pares him the Pain of a violent Death, &s;ends him quietly out of the World, when the radical Moi&s;ture is quite &s;pent, and which in &s;hort, has all the Properties that are fancied to be in <HI>Aurum Potabile,</HI> and the <HI>Elixir</HI> which a great many Per&s;ons have &s;ought after in vain.</P>
<P>But alas! mo&s;t Men &s;uffers them&s;elves to be &s;educed by the Charms of a vo|luptuous Life. They have not Courage enough to deny their Appetites; and being per&s;uaded by their Prejudices &s;o far, as to think they cannot prevent the gratification of them without abridging too much of their Plea&s;ures, they form Sy&s;tems whereby to per&s;uade them|&s;elves, that it is more eligible to live
<PB N="26" REF="51">ten Years le&s;s, than to be upon the Re|&s;traint, and deprived of whatever may gratifie the Cravings of their Appetites.</P>
<P>Alas! They know not the Value of ten Years healthful Life in an Age when a Man may enjoy the full u&s;e of his Rea&s;on and make an Advantage of all his Experiences: In an Age where|in a Man may appear to be truly &s;uch by his Wi&s;dom and Conduct; la&s;tly, in a Time wherein he is in a Condition of reaping the Fruits of his Studies and Labours.</P>
<P>To in&s;tance only in the Sciences; it is certain, that the be&s;t Books which we have extant, were compo&s;ed in tho&s;e la&s;t ten Years which the Intem|perate de&s;pi&s;e; and that Men's Minds growing to perfection proportionably as their Bodies grow old, Arts and Sciences would have lo&s;t a great Deal of their Perfection, if all the great Men who were Profe&s;&s;ors of that had lived ten Years &s;horter than they did. For my part, I think it proper to keep the fatal Day of my Death as far off as I
<PB N="27" REF="52">can. If this had been my Re&s;oluti|on, I &s;hould not have fini&s;hed &s;everal Pieces, which will be both plea&s;ing and in&s;tructing to tho&s;e who come after me.</P>
<P>The Sen&s;uali&s;ts farther object, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to live a regular Life. To this I reply; That <HI>Galen,</HI> who was &s;o great a Man, made choi&s;e of it, and advi&s;ed others to do the &s;ame, as being the be&s;t Cour&s;e they could take. <HI>Plato, Cicero, I&s;ocrates,</HI> and a great many famous Men of pa&s;t Ages im|braced it; and in our Time, Pope <HI>Paul Farneze,</HI> Cardinal <HI>Bembo,</HI> and two of our Doges, <HI>Lando</HI> and <HI>Donato,</HI> have practi&s;ed it, and thereby arrived to an extreme old Age. I might in|&s;tance in others of a meaner Extract; but, having followed this Rule my&s;elf, I think I cannot produce a more con|vincing Proof of its being practicable, and that the greate&s;t Trouble to be met with therein is the fir&s;t re&s;olv|ing and entering upon &s;uch a Cour&s;e of Life.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="53">You will tell me that <HI>Plato,</HI> as &s;ober a Man as he was, yet affirmed, that a Man devoted to the Admini&s;tration of the Government in publick Affairs, can hardly lead an exact and regular Life, being often obliged in the Service of the State to be expo&s;ed to the Badne&s;s of Weather, to the Fatigues of Travel|ling, and to eat whatever he can meet with. This cannot be denied; but then I maintain, that the&s;e Things will never ha&s;ten a Man's Death, provided he that is in this Po&s;t accu&s;toms him&s;elf to a frugal Way of Living. There is no Man in what Condition &s;oever he is, but may prevent his over eating, and cure him&s;elf of tho&s;e Di&s;tempers that are cau&s;ed by Repletion. They who have the Charge of publick Affairs committed to their Tru&s;t are more ob|iged to it than any others: Where there is no Glory to be got for their Country, they ought not to &s;acri&s;ice them&s;elves: They &s;hould pre&s;erve them&s;elves to &s;erve it, and if they pur&s;ue my Method, it is certain they would ward off the
<PB N="29" REF="54">Di&s;tempers which Heat, and Cold, and Fatigues might bring upon them; or &s;hould they be di&s;turbed by them it would be but very lightly.</P>
<P>It may likewi&s;e be objected, that if one who is well, is dieted like one who is &s;ick, he will be at a lo&s;s about the choi&s;e of his Diet when any Di&s;temper comes upon him. To this I &s;ay, that Nature which pre&s;erves all Beings as far as po&s;&s;ible, teaches us how we ought to govern our&s;elves in &s;uch a Ca&s;e. It begins by depriving us alto|gether of our Appetite, that we can eat little or nothing at all. At that time, whether the &s;ick Per&s;on has been &s;ober or intemperate, no other Food ought to be made u&s;e of, but &s;uch as is proper for the Condition wherein he is; &s;uch as Broth, Jellies, Cordials, Barley-water, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> When his Reco|very will permit him to make u&s;e of a more &s;olid Nouri&s;hment, he mu&s;t take le&s;s than he was u&s;ed to before his &s;ick|ne&s;s, and notwith&s;tanding the eager|ne&s;s of his Appetite, he mu&s;t take Care
<PB N="30" REF="55">of his Stomach till he has a perfect Cure. Should he do otherwi&s;e, he would over-burden Nature, and infal|libly relap&s;e into the Danger from whence he e&s;caped. But notwith|&s;tanding this. I dare to aver, that be who leads a &s;ober and regular Life will hardly ever be &s;ick; or if he is, it will be but &s;eldom and for a &s;hort time. This Way of Living pre&s;erves us from tho&s;e Humours which occa&s;ion our In|firmities, and by Con&s;equence heals us of all tho&s;e Di&s;tempers which they en|gender. The Defect of the Cau&s;e does Phy&s;ically prevent the Production of the Effect, and the Effect cannot be dangerous and violent, when the Cau&s;e it&s;elf is but &s;light and weak.</P>
<P>Since then Sobriety lays a Re&s;traint upon our Pa&s;&s;ions, pre&s;erves our Health, and is both whol&s;ome and be|neficial to us, ought it not to be fol|lowed and embraced by all Men? Self|love if well under&s;tood advi&s;es us to it: It is neither impo&s;&s;ible nor difficult, and the Method I take ought to di&s;cou|rage
<PB N="31" REF="56">no body from undertaking it. For I do not pretend to per&s;uade every body to eat as little as I do, or to debar them&s;elves from the U&s;e of a great ma|ny things from which I refrain. I eat but little, becau&s;e my Stomach is nice, and I ab&s;tain from certain Di&s;hes be|cau&s;e they are prejudicial to me. They who are not offended by them, are not obliged to refrain from them, but are allowed the u&s;e of them; only they ought to ab&s;tain from eating too much even of that which agrees with them, becau&s;e it would be prejudicial to them, &s;ince an over-charged Stomach cannot &s;o ea&s;ily dige&s;t it. In &s;hort he that is offended at nothing has no occa&s;ion of enquiring into the Quality of his Diet, he ought only to be cautious of the Quantity thereof.</P>
<P>It &s;ignifies nothing to tell me, that there are &s;everals who denying them|&s;elves nothing, do yet live as long with|out Infirmities as they who are &s;ober. This is but rare, uncertain, hazardous, and in a manner Miraculous. The
<PB N="32" REF="57">In&s;tances of this Nature do not at all ju&s;tifie the Conduct of tho&s;e Per&s;ons, who reckon it an extraordinary Hap|pine&s;s, and are commonly the Betrayers of their good Con&s;titution. It is more certain, that an infirm old Man, will live longer by ob&s;erving a &s;trict Regi|men, than a young, vigorous, and healthful Man will, that gives the loo&s;e to his Appetite.</P>
<P>However this is certain, that a good Con&s;titution with the Support of a re|gular Life, will carry a Man farther than a weak one, though managed with an equal Degree of Care. God and Nature may form Bodies &s;o &s;trong and robu&s;t, as to be Proof again&s;t all that is contrary to us; as I have ob&s;erved at <HI>Venice</HI> the Procurator <HI>Thomas Mate|rini,</HI> and at <HI>Padua</HI> the Chevalier <HI>An|tonio Capo de Vacca;</HI> but among a thou|&s;and one &s;hall hardly meet with the like. All others who are for a long and healthful Life, who would die without an Agony and only by a pure Di&s;&s;olu|tion, who would, la&s;tly, enjoy the
<PB N="33" REF="58">Advantages of a happy old Age, will never come to what they aim at with|out Sobriety.</P>
<P>'Tis Temperance alone which &s;up|ports our Con&s;titution, without any Alteration; it creates nothing but &s;weat and whol&s;ome Humors, which &s;ending up no Vapours to the Brain, leave the Mind in the perfect u&s;e of the Organs, and are no Hinderance from rai&s;ing its Contemplation from the Wonders of the World, to the Con&s;ideration of the Power of its Creator. A Man can be never the better for tho&s;e Reflections, when his Head is full of the Vapours of Wine and Meat. But when once the&s;e Fumes are gone, his under&s;tand|ing is clear, he ob&s;erves and di&s;cerns a thou&s;and agreable things, which he would not have known or comprehen|ded in another State. He can then di&s;cern the Fal&s;ity of tho&s;e Plea&s;ures which Voluptuou&s;ne&s;s Promi&s;es, the real Goods with which Virtue loads us, and the Unhappine&s;s of tho&s;e whom a
<PB N="34" REF="59">fatal Delu&s;ion renders Slaves to their Pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>The three mo&s;t dangerous are the Plea&s;ure of the Ta&s;te, the hunting after Honours, and the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Riches. The&s;e De&s;ires increa&s;e with the Age of old Men, who having always led a di&s;|orderly Life, have &s;uffered their Lu&s;ts to take Root in their Youth and Man|hood. A wi&s;e Man does not &s;tay &s;o long before he corrects them; he de|clares betimes a War again&s;t his Pa&s;|&s;ions, of which he does not obtain the Ma&s;tery till after &s;everal Struggles, and then Virtue in its turn triumphs, and crowns the Man with the Ble&s;&s;ings of Heaven and the E&s;teem of all the World.</P>
<P>Is he ready to pay the Tribute that is due to Nature? Full of acknowledg|ments for the Favours already received from God, he throws him&s;elf into the Arms of his future Mercy. He is not afraid of tho&s;e everla&s;ting Puni&s;hments, which they de&s;erve, who by their In|temperance offer Violence to their own
<PB N="35" REF="60">Lives. He dies without complaining, becau&s;e he was not to live for ever; and his Rea&s;on &s;weetens the Bitterne&s;s of this Fatality: In a Word, he leaves the World generou&s;ly, when in a long Tract of happy Years he has had time enough to enjoy his Vertue and Repu|tation, and con&s;iders that not one in a thou&s;and who have lived otherwi&s;e than he has done, has arrived to &s;uch an Age.</P>
<P>He is comforted the more upon con|&s;idering that this Separation will not be violent, painful or feveri&s;h. His End is calm, and he expires like a Lamp when the Oil is &s;pent, no Delirium, no Convul&s;ions attending him; and &s;o he pa&s;&s;es from this corruptible Life to that who&s;e eternal Happine&s;s is the Re|ward of the virtuous.</P>
<P>O happy, ble&s;&s;ed, and regular Life, how worthy art thou of our E&s;teem, and how do&s;tthou de&s;erve to be prefer|red before thy contrary? We need on|ly reflect upon the different Effects of both, to be &s;en&s;ible of the Advantages
<PB N="36" REF="61">that attend thee, tho' thy Name alone is &s;ufficient to attract that E&s;teem which thou de&s;erve&s;t.</P>
<P>Having thus given the Rea&s;ons which made me abandon an intemperate and take up with a &s;ober Life, as al&s;o the Method I ob&s;erved in it, and the Be|nefit which I reaped from it, and the Advantages which others may receive from the Practice thereof, I &s;hall now di|rect my Di&s;cour&s;e to tho&s;e who &s;uppo&s;e it to be no Benefit to grow old, becau&s;e they fancy that when a Man is pa&s;t &s;eventy his Life is nothing but Weak|ne&s;s, Infirmity and Mi&s;ery. In the fir&s;t Place I can a&s;&s;ure them that they are mightily mi&s;taken, and that I find my|&s;elf, as old as I am, which is much be|yond whatthey &s;peak of, to be in the mo&s;t plea&s;ant and delight&s;ome Stage of Life.</P>
<P>To prove that I have Rea&s;on for what I &s;ay, they need only enquire how I &s;pend my time, what are my u&s;ual Plea&s;ures and Bu&s;ine&s;s, and to hear the Te&s;timony of all tho&s;e who
<PB N="37" REF="62">knew me. They unanimou&s;ly te&s;tifie that the Life I lead is not a dead and langui&s;hing Life, but as happy an one as can be wi&s;hed for in this World.</P>
<P>They will tell you that I am &s;till &s;o &s;trong at four&s;core and three, as to mount a Hor&s;e without any Help: That I can not only go down Stairs without any concern, but likewi&s;e de|&s;cend a Hill all on foot; That I am al|ways merry, always plea&s;ed, always in Humour, maintaining a happy Peace in my own Mind, the Sweetne&s;s and Serenity whereof appear at all times in my Countenance.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, they know that it is in my Power to pa&s;s away the time very plea|&s;antly, having nothing to hinder me from ta&s;ting all the Plea&s;ures of an a|greeable Society of &s;everal Per&s;ons of parts and worth. When I am willing to be alone, I read good Books, and &s;ometimes fall a writting, &s;eeking al|ways an Occa&s;ion of being u&s;eful to the publick, and doing Service to private Per&s;ons as far as po&s;&s;ible. I do all this
<PB N="38" REF="63">without the lea&s;t Trouble; and in &s;uch times as I &s;et apart for the&s;e Employ|ments.</P>
<P>I dwell in a Hou&s;e, which be&s;ide its being &s;ituated in the plea&s;ante&s;t Part of <HI>Padua,</HI> may be looked upon as the mo&s;t convenient and mo&s;t agreeable Man&s;ion of this City. I there make my Apartments proper for the Winter and Summer, which &s;erve as a Shelter to de|fend me from the Extreme heat of the one, and the rigid Coldne&s;s of the o|ther. I walk out in my Gardens along my Canals and Walks, where I always meet with &s;ome little thing or other to do, which at the &s;ame time employs and diverts me.</P>
<P>I &s;pend the Months of <HI>April, May, September,</HI> and <HI>October,</HI> at my Coun|try-hou&s;e; which is in the fine&s;t &s;ituation imaginable. The Air of it is good, the Avenues neat, the Gardens magni|ficent, the Waters clear and plentiful; and this Seat may well pa&s;s for an in|chanted Palace. When I am there I &s;ometimes divert my&s;elf with a Sport
<PB N="39" REF="64">that agrees be&s;t with my Age, <HI>viz.</HI> in going out with a &s;etting Dog or with Terriers.</P>
<P>Sometimes I take a walk to my <HI>Villa,</HI> all who&s;e Streets terminate at a large Square, in the mid&s;t of which is a pret|ty neat Church, and large enough for the bigne&s;s of the Pari&s;h.</P>
<P>Through this <HI>Villa</HI> runs a Rivulet, and the Country about is enriched with fruitful and well cultivated Fields, ha|ving at pre&s;ent a con&s;iderable number of Inhabitants. This was not &s;o an|ciently; it was a mar&s;hy Place, and the Air &s;o bad, that it was more proper for Frogs and Toads, than for Men to dwell in: I thought it advi&s;eable to drain the Mari&s;h-lands, &s;o that being dry, the Air became more whole&s;ome: Se|veral Families have &s;ettled there and rendered the Place very populous, where I may &s;ay that I have dedicated to the Lord a Church, Altars, and Hearts to wor&s;hip him; which Reflec|tion is a great Comfort to me as often as I make it.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="65">Sometimes I pay a Vi&s;it to my Friends, of the Neighbouring Towns, who procure me an acquaintance with the Ingenious Men of the Place. I di&s;cour&s;e with them about Architecture, Painting, Sculpture, Mathematicks, and Agriculture; Sciences for which I had all my Life long a great fondne&s;s, and the rather becau&s;e they were very much in e&s;teem in my time.</P>
<P>I &s;aw with Curio&s;ity the new Pieces of Workman&s;hip; and it was a new Plea&s;ure to me to take a &s;econd View of tho&s;e which I had already &s;een; and I am always learning &s;omething that I am plea&s;ed to know.</P>
<P>I vi&s;it publick Buildings, Palaces, Gar|dens, Antiquities, Squares, Churches and Fortifications; pa&s;&s;ing by no Place that may gratific my Curio&s;ity, or give me any new. Light into things.</P>
<P>That which charmed me mo&s;t in the little Journeys I took, was the various Pro&s;pects of Places through which I went. The Plains, the Hills, the Ri|vulers, the Ca&s;tles, and the Villages,
<PB N="41" REF="66">were as &s;o many Objects that offered them&s;elves with plea&s;ure to my Sight; and afforded a delightful View.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the Plea&s;ures I take are not imperfect upon the account of the Weakne&s;s of my Organs. I &s;ee and hear as well as ever I did in my Life: All my Sen&s;es are as free and as per|fect as ever, e&s;pecially my Ta&s;te, which is better with that little which I eat at pre&s;ent, than when I was a Slave to my Appetite.</P>
<P>Changing of Beds is no hindrance to my repo&s;e, I &s;leep very &s;oundly; and if I dream my Dreams are plea|&s;ant.</P>
<P>'Tis with a great Deal of Satisfaction that I &s;ee the End of a Work of &s;uch importance to this State, which has rendered &s;o many Places fertile, that be|fore were uncultivated and u&s;ele&s;s; a thing I never expected to have &s;een com|pleated, con&s;idering how many States are loath to begin and weary of carrying on Undertakings of &s;o va&s;t a Charge and &s;o di&s;&s;icult to be performed. I
<PB N="42" REF="67">was upon the Places for two Months together with the Commi&s;&s;aries that had the over&s;ight of the&s;e Works, and this during the greate&s;t Heat of Sum|mer; and yet thanks to my Regimen, the only Pre&s;erver of my Health, nei|ther the unwhole&s;ome Air of the Fens, nor the Fatigue did me any Inju|ry</P>
<P>Such as the&s;e are the Employments and Diver&s;ions of my old Age, which is, Ble&s;&s;ed be God, free from tho&s;e Di|&s;turbances of Mind and Infirmities of Body under which &s;o many poor rheu|matick and crazy old Men, as well as mi&s;erable young Men labour.</P>
<P>If in di&s;cour&s;ing upon &s;uch a &s;erious Subject as this, it be allowable to &s;peak of Trifles. I might tell you that at the Age of four&s;core and three, a &s;o|ber Life had pre&s;erved me in that Sprightline&s;s of Thought and Gaiety of Humour, as to be able to compo&s;e a Play for the u&s;e of the Stage, which was diverting without &s;hocking the Audience. Comedy is u&s;ually the pro|duct
<PB N="43" REF="68">of Youth, as Tragedy is of old Age, the latter by Gravity of its Com|po&s;ure &s;uiting to riper Years, whil&s;t the former by its facetiou&s;ne&s;s is more a|greeable to tho&s;e that are young. If Antiquity has &s;o far commended and admired a <HI>Greek</HI> Poet, for having in the &s;eventy third Year of his Age com|po&s;ed a Tragedy, which is a grave and &s;erious Poem, why &s;hould I be le&s;s admired and happy in having compo&s;ed a Comedy, which is diverting at my Age? For this I am &s;ure of, that tho' that Author was ten Years younger than I am, yet he had not more health, nor a bri&s;ker Genius.</P>
<P>To conclude, as an Addition to my Happine&s;s, I &s;ee my&s;elf as it were im|mortalized, and born again by the great Number of my De&s;cendants. I meet with not only two or three when I come home, but eleven Grand-children, the elde&s;t of which is eighteen, and the younge&s;t two Years old, all born of the &s;ame Father and Mother; all healthful, of good Parts, and of pro|mi&s;ing
<PB N="44" REF="69">Hopes. I take a Delight in playing with the Young&s;ters; Children between three and five Years of Age, being generally verry merry and divert|ing Company. Tho&s;e who are older entertain me better: I often make them &s;ing and play upon mu&s;ical In&s;truments, and &s;ometimes I Join in Con&s;ort with them.</P>
<P>Call you this an infirm and crazy old, Age, as they pretend, who &s;ay that a Man is but half alive after he is &s;even|ty? They may believe me if they plea&s;e, but in reality I would not change my Age and Life for the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing Youth, which lays no re&s;traint upon its Sen&s;es, being &s;ure that it is Subject to a great many Di&s;tempers which may occa&s;ion Death.</P>
<P>I remember all the Follies that I was guilty of in my younger Days. And am perfectly &s;en&s;ible of the Danger and Im|prudence of them. I know with what Violence young Per&s;ons are carried a|way by their Pa&s;&s;ions, and how much they pre&s;ume upon their Strength, but
<PB N="45" REF="70">would think they had taken a &s;ure Lea&s;e of their Life; they expo&s;e it ra&s;hly, as if it were chargeable to them, and they run headlong into what&s;oever their Concupi&s;cence prompts them to. They mu&s;t gratifie their Appetites whatever it co&s;t them, without perceiving that they feed tho&s;e ill Humours which will render their Lives mi&s;erable, and ha&s;t|en the Hour of their Death.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e two, the one is cruel; the other dreadful and in&s;upportable by all &s;en&s;ual Men, e&s;pecially young people, who &s;uppo&s;e they have a better Title to Life than others, and Libertines who are &s;o blind as to flatter them&s;elves that God will permit their Sins to go unpu|ni&s;hed.</P>
<P>As for my part, ble&s;&s;ed be God, I find my&s;elf freed from tho&s;e ju&s;t Fears which cannot but alarm them whenever they are capable of Reflections. For in the fir&s;t Place I am certain that I &s;hall not fall &s;ick, &s;ince I take care by a regular Diet to ward off Infirmities. And then &s;econdly, the Time of my
<PB N="46" REF="71">Death approaching teaches me to &s;ub|mit quietly to that which is inevitable, and from which no Man could ever &s;e|cure him&s;elf. 'Tis folly to be afraid of that which cannot be avoided; but I hope whenever the Time comes, the Merits of Je&s;us Chri&s;t will be available to me; and tho' I am &s;en&s;ible that I mu&s;t die, yet I am per&s;waded it will be a long time 'ere I &s;hall, &s;ince this Di&s;|&s;olution cannot happen but by the Con&s;umption of the radical Moi&s;ture which is exhau&s;ted by Age.</P>
<P>The regular Life which I lead has left Death this only Way of de&s;troying me. The Humours of my Body can do me more Injury than the elementary Qualities which prevailed in my Nature ever &s;ince my Birth. I am not &s;o &s;tupid as not to perceive, that having had a Beginning, I mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity have an End; but &s;ince we mu&s;t die, doubtle&s;s that Death is attended with le&s;s Terror which happens by the natural Di&s;&s;olu|tion of the Parts of which we are com|po&s;ed. Nature her&s;elf having tied the
<PB N="47" REF="72">Bands of our Life, can likewi&s;e untie them again without the lea&s;t Pain, and can &s;tay longer before it executes that Office than Sickne&s;&s;es generally do, which with Violence break the Bands of our Life a&s;under, and which can|not happen to us but by foreign Cau|&s;es, &s;ince nothing is more contrary to Nature than that which tends to our De&s;truction.</P>
<P>When a Man draws near his End, he perceives his Strength to abate by Degrees; the Organs and all the Facul|ties grow weak; he can no longer walk, and can hardly &s;peak; his Judg|ment and Memory fail him: He be|comes blind, deaf and bowed together; in fine his whole Frame is worn out. Ble&s;&s;ed be God, I am not as yet in that Condition. On the contrary I promi&s;e my&s;elf, that my Soul finds it|&s;elf &s;o well in my Body, where &s;he meets with nothing but Peace, Unity and Concord, (in &s;pite of all the diffe|rent Qualities of the Humours which compo&s;e us, and the various Inclinations
<PB N="48" REF="73">that are produced by the Sen&s;es) that &s;he will be under no Temptation to wi&s;h a &s;peedy Separation, and that it will be a long time before &s;he can be brought to a Re&s;olution.</P>
<P>To conclude, I am a&s;&s;ured that I &s;hall &s;till live &s;everal Years in Health, and that I &s;hall long enjoy the Plea&s;ure of being in the World, which is certainly very comfortable, when a Man knows how to make a right u&s;e of it. I hope to reap a greater Satisfaction from hence in the other Life, and I &s;hall lie under Obligations to the Vertues of the Regi|men, to which I am indebted for the Victory I have obtained over my Pa&s;|&s;ions. Nor is there any Man but may hope for the &s;ame Happine&s;s, if he would live as I have done.</P>
<P>A &s;ober Life therefore being &s;o ne|ce&s;&s;ary, its Name &s;o commendable, the Enjoyment of it &s;o beneficial, nothing remains after what have been &s;aid but to conjure all Men as they love them|&s;elves to make the be&s;t of Life and lay in Stock of that, which being the mo&s;t
<PB N="49" REF="74">precious of all, de&s;erves to be &s;ought after if we have it not, and to be pre|&s;erved if we have it.</P>
<P>'Tis this divine Sobriety which, is al|ways plea&s;ing to God, and always the Friend of Nature; &s;he is the Daughter of Rea&s;on, the Si&s;ter of all other Vir|tues, the Companion of Temperance; always chearful, always mode&s;t, always Wi&s;e and regular in her Operations. She is the Root of Health, of Indu&s;try, and of whatever becomes a great Soul to be employed about. She has the Laws of God and Nature both to ju|&s;tifie and enforce her. When &s;he reigns, Repletions, Di&s;orders, evil Habits, &s;uperfluous Humours, Fevers, Aches, and the Fears of Death, do not di&s;reli&s;h or imbitter our Plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>The Happine&s;s of it &s;hould invite us: The Comline&s;s of it &s;hould allure us to embrace it. She offers to us the Duration of our mortal Being; &s;he is the faithful Guardian of the Life of Man, whether he be rich or poor, young or old, or of what Sex &s;oever.
<PB N="50" REF="75">She teaches the rich not to abu&s;e his Wealth, the poor to bear patiently the Inconveniences of his State; She teach|es the Man Wi&s;dom, the Woman Cha|&s;tity; old Men the Secret of putting off their Death, and young Men the Means of enjoying a long Life. She files off the Ru&s;t of our Sen&s;es, ren|ders the Body vigorous, the Mind clear, the Soul lively; gives us a happy Me|mory, free Motions, and ju&s;t Actions. 'Tis by it that the Mind being di&s;en|gaged from Matter enjoys a larger Free|dom, and the Blood runs &s;moothly in our Veins without meeting with any Ob|&s;truction in its Circulation. 'Tis la&s;t|ly by it that all the Powers both of Soul and Body are kept up in a perfect Uni|on, which nothing but the contrary Vice can di&s;turb.</P>
<P>O &s;acred and healthful Sobriety! The powerful Support of our Nature! The true Phy&s;ick of Body and Mind! How ought Men to prai&s;e thee and acknow|ledge thy Benefits, &s;ince thou furni&s;h|e&s;t them with the means of attainning
<PB N="51" REF="76">Heaven, and of pre&s;erving Life and Health here upon Earth!</P>
<P>But not de&s;igning to enlarge any far|ther in Commendation of this Virtue, I &s;hall conclude, keeping within the Bounds of Sobriety on this Subject; not becau&s;e I have &s;aid enough of it, but that I may &s;ay more of it another time.</P>

<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> The Method of correcting a bad Con|&s;titution.</HEAD>
<P>SEveral Per&s;ons, who&s;e weak Con|&s;titution required a great Care in the Management of it, having been well &s;atisfied with what I have written con|cerning Sobriety, the Experience which they have had of the U&s;efulne&s;s of my Coun&s;els, and the Acknowledgments which they have made thereof; encou|rage me to take up my Pen again, that I may convince tho&s;e, who meet with
<PB N="52" REF="77">no Inconvenience from Intemperance, that they are in the wrong in relying &s;o much on the Strength of their Con&s;ti|tution.</P>
<P>Let it be ever &s;o well compo&s;ed, yet it holds not good but to &s;uch an Age. The&s;e Per&s;ons &s;eldom arrive to &s;ixty, but they decay all of a &s;udden, and per|ceive them&s;elves loaded with a Compli|cation of Di&s;tempers. Some are gouty, drop&s;ical, and rheumatical: Others are Subject to Cholicks, the Stone and Piles; la&s;tly, to abundance of Di&s;tem|pers which would never have happened to them, if they had been as wi&s;e as to have taken care of them&s;elves, in their Youth. If they die infirm at four&s;core Years of Age, they might have lived in Health to an hundred, and &s;o have run out the Term of Life which Na|ture has left open to all Men.</P>
<P>It is to be &s;uppo&s;ed that this com|mon Parent wi&s;hes that all her Children might live at lea&s;t a Century; and &s;ince &s;ome among them have lived to a long|er Date, why &s;hould not others have
<PB N="53" REF="78">a right of expecting the &s;ame advan|tage?</P>
<P>I do not di&s;agree but that we are &s;ubject to the Stars which were predo|minant at our Birth. Their good or bad A&s;pects enfeeble or &s;trengthen the Springs of our Life; but Man being endued with Judgment and Rea&s;on ought to repair by his prudent Conduct the Harm which his Planet may have done him he may prolong his Days by the means of a &s;ober Life to as long a Period, as if he had been born very &s;trong and lu&s;ty. Prudence prevents and corrects the Malignity of the Pla|nets; they give us certain Inclinations, they carry us out to certain Pa&s;&s;ions; but they lay no Violence upon us, we may re&s;i&s;t them, and in this Sen&s;e a Wife Man is above the Stars.</P>
<P>I was born very cholerick and ha&s;ty; I flew out into a Pa&s;&s;ion for the lea&s;t Tri&s;&s;le, I huffed all Mankind, and was &s;o intolerable that a great many Per&s;ons of Repute avoided my Company. I apprehended the Injury which I did
<PB N="54" REF="79">my&s;elf; I knew that Anger is a real Frenzy; that it di&s;turbs our Judgment, that it tran&s;ports us beyond our&s;elves, and that the Difference between a Pa&s;|&s;ionate and a mad Man is only this, that the latter has lo&s;t his Rea&s;on for ever, and the former is only deprived of it by Fits. A &s;ober Life cured me of this Frenzy; by its A&s;&s;i&s;tance I be|came &s;o moderate and &s;o much a Ma|&s;ter of my Pa&s;&s;ion, that nobody could perceive that it was born with me.</P>
<P>A Man may likewi&s;e with Rea&s;on and a regular Life correct a bad Con|&s;titution, and notwith&s;tanding the Ten|derne&s;s thereof may live a long time in good Health. I &s;hould never have &s;een forty Years, had I followed all my Inclinations, and yet I am in the eighty &s;ixth Year of my Age. If the long and dangerous Di&s;tempers which I had in my Youth, had not con&s;umed a great deal of the radical Moi&s;ture, the lo&s;s of which is irreparable, I might have pro|mi&s;ed my&s;elf to have lived a compleat Century. But without flattering my|&s;elf,
<PB N="55" REF="80">I find it to be a great Matter to have arrived to forty &s;ix Years more than I ever expected, and that in my old Age my Con&s;titution is &s;till &s;o good, that not only my Teeth, my Voice, my Memory and my Heart are in as good a Condition as ever they were in the bri&s;ke&s;t Days of my Youth; but likewi&s;e my Judgment has lo&s;t nothing of its clearne&s;s and force.</P>
<P>I am of the Opinion that this proceeds from the Abridgment I make of my Food proportionably to my growing in|to Years. Experience, which tells us that Infants have a greater Appetite and are more often hungry, than grown Men, ought likewi&s;e to teach us, that in old Age we have le&s;s need of Nou|ri&s;hment than in the beginning of our Life. A Man who is very old can hardly eat, becau&s;e he can &s;carce di|ge&s;t what he eats; a little &s;erves his turn, and the Yolk of an Egg is a good Meal to him. I &s;hall be &s;atisfied there|with to the end of my Days, hoping by this Conduct neither to die with
<PB N="56" REF="81">Violence nor with Pain, not que&s;tion|ing but that they who will imitate me, will meet with as ea&s;y an Exit, &s;ince we are all of the &s;ame <HI>Species,</HI> and made up of the &s;ame Materials.</P>
<P>Since nothing then is more advanta|geous for a Man upon Earth than to live long; He is obliged to pre&s;erve his Health as far as po&s;&s;ible, and this he cannot do without Sobriety. 'Tis true indeed, that there are &s;everal who eat and drink plentifully, and yet live to an hundred Years of Age. 'Tis by their Example that others flatter them&s;elves with the Hopes of attaining to the &s;ame Age, without any Occa&s;ion of laying a re&s;traint upon them&s;elves. But they are in the wrong upon the&s;e two Ac|counts: Fir&s;t, becau&s;e there is hardly one in a thou&s;and, that has &s;o &s;trong a Con&s;titution. Secondly, becau&s;e &s;uch Men do generally end their Lives by &s;uch Di&s;tempers as put them into great Agonics by dying, which would never happen to tho&s;e that have the &s;ame Go|vernment of them&s;elves that I have.
<PB N="57" REF="82">A Man runs the Ri&s;que of not attaining to fifty Years of Age for not daring to undertake a regular Cour&s;e of Life, which is no impo&s;&s;ible thing, &s;ince it is what I and &s;everal others have practi&s;ed and do practi&s;e: And a Man becomes in&s;en&s;ibly a Murderer of him&s;elf, be|cau&s;e he cannot be per&s;uaded that not|with&s;tanding the fal&s;e Charms of a vo|luptuous Life; a wi&s;e Man ought not to look upon it as any Hard&s;hip to put in practice what his Rea&s;on advi&s;es him.</P>
<P>Rea&s;on, if we hearken to it will tell us, that a good Regimen is nece&s;&s;ary for the prolonging of our Days, and that it con&s;i&s;ts in two things: Fir&s;t, in taking Care of the Quality; and &s;econdly, of the Quantity, &s;o as to eat and drink no|thing that offends the Stomach; nor a|ny more than what we can ea&s;ily dige&s;t. Our Experience ought to be our Guide in the&s;e two Principles, when we are arrived to forty, fifty, or three&s;core Years of Age. He who puts in Prac|ti&s;e that Knowledge which he has of
<PB N="58" REF="83">what is good for him, and goes on in a frugal way of living, keeps the Hu|mours in a ju&s;t Temperature, and pre|vents them from being altered, tho' he &s;uffer Heat and Cold, tho' he be fati|gued, tho' his &s;leep be broke, provided there be no Exce&s;s in any of them. This being &s;o, what an Obligation does a Man ly under of living &s;oberly? And ought he not to free him&s;elf from the Fears of &s;inking under the lea&s;t Intem|perature of the Air, and under the lea&s;t Fatigue, which make us &s;ick upon e|very &s;light Occa&s;ion?</P>
<P>'Tis true indeed, the mo&s;t &s;ober may &s;ometimes be indi&s;po&s;ed, when they are unavoidably obliged to tran&s;gre&s;s the Rule which they have been u&s;ed to ob|&s;erve; but then they are certain that their Indi&s;po&s;ition will not la&s;t above two or three Days at mo&s;t; nor can they fall into a Fever. Wearine&s;s and Faintne&s;s are ea&s;ily remedied by Re&s;t and good Diet. The Malignancy of the Stars cannot put the malignant Hu|mours in a Ferment, in Bodies which
<PB N="59" REF="84">have them not: Tho' Di&s;tempers which proceed from Intemperance have an internal Cau&s;e, and may be dangerous; tho&s;e which are derived from the In|fluences of the Planets, affect us only externally, and cannot produce any great Di&s;orders.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome who feed high, and maintain that what&s;oever they eat is &s;o little a Di&s;turbance to them, that they cannot perceive in what Part of their Body their Stomach lies; but I aver, that they do not &s;peak as they think, nor is it natural. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible that any created Being &s;hould be of &s;o per|fect a Compo&s;ition, as that neither Heat nor Cold, Dry nor Moi&s;t &s;hould have any Influence over it, and that the Va|riety of Food which they make u&s;e of, of different Qualities, &s;hould be equal|ly agreeable to them. Tho&s;e Men cannot but acknowledge that they are &s;ometimes out of Order; if it is not owing to a &s;en&s;ible Indige&s;tion, yet they are troubled with. Head-achs, want of Sleep, and Fevers, of which
<PB N="60" REF="85">they are cured by a Diet, and taking &s;uch Medecines as are proper for Eva|cuation. It is therefore certain that their Di&s;tempers proceed from Repleti|on, or from their having eat or drunk &s;omething that does not agree with their Stomachs.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t old People excu&s;e their high Feeding, by &s;aying that it is nece&s;&s;ary for them to eat a great Deal to keep up their natural Heat, which dimini&s;hes proportionably as they grow in Years, and to creat an Appetite 'tis requi&s;ite to find out proper Sauces, and to eat whatever they have a Fancy for; and that without thus humouring their Pa|lates they &s;hould be &s;oon in their Graves. To this I reply, that Nature for the Pre&s;ervation of a Man in Years, has &s;o compo&s;ed him, that he may live with a little Food; that his Stomach cannot dige&s;t a great Quantity, and that he has no need of being afraid of dying for want of eating; &s;ince when he is &s;ick he is forced to have recour&s;e to a regular Sort of Diet, which is the fir&s;t
<PB N="61" REF="86">and main thing pre&s;cribed him by his Phy&s;icians. La&s;tly, that if this Reme|dy is of &s;uch Efficacy as to &s;natch us out of the Arms of Death, 'tis a mi|&s;take to &s;uppo&s;e, that a Man may not, by eating a little more than he does when he is &s;ick, live a long time with|out ever being &s;ick.</P>
<P>Others had rather be di&s;turbed twice or thrice a Year with the Gout, the Sciatica, and other epidemical Di&s;tem|pers, than to be always put to the Tor|ment and Mortification of laying a re|&s;traint upon their Appetites, being &s;ure that, when they are indi&s;po&s;ed, a regu|lar Diet will be an infallible Remedy and Cure. But let them be informed by me, that as they grow up in Years their natural Heat abates; that a regu|lar Diet, de&s;pi&s;ed as a Precaution, and only look'd upon as Phy&s;ick, cannot al|ways have the &s;ame Effect, or Force to draw off the Crudities, and repair the Di&s;orders which are cau&s;ed by Reple|tion; and la&s;tly, that they run the ha|zard
<PB N="62" REF="87">of being cheated by their Hope and Intemperance.</P>
<P>Others &s;ay that it is more eligible to feed high and enjoy them&s;elves, tho' a Man lives the le&s;s while. It is no &s;ur|prizing Matter, that Fools and mad|men &s;hould contemn and de&s;pi&s;e Life; the World would be no Lo&s;er when|ever they go out of it; but 'tis a con&s;i|derable Lo&s;s when wi&s;e, virtuous and holy Men drop into the Grave. If one of them were a Bi&s;hop, he might have been an Archbi&s;hop in growing older; if he were in &s;ome con&s;iderable Po&s;t in the State, he might have arrived to the highe&s;t; if he were learned, or excelled in any Art, he would have been more excellent, and done more Honour to his Country and him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Others there are, who, perceiving them&s;elves to grow old, tho' their Sto|mach becomes le&s;s capable of dige&s;ting well every Day than other, yet will not upon that Account abate any thing of their Diet. They only abridge them|&s;elves in the Number of their Meals; and
<PB N="63" REF="88">becau&s;e they find two or three times a Day is trouble&s;ome, they think their Health is &s;ufficiently provided for, by making only one Meal; that &s;o the time between one Repa&s;t and another may (as they &s;ay) facilitate the Dige&s;tion of tho&s;e Aliments which they might have taken at twice: For this Rea&s;on they eat at this one Meal &s;o much that their Stomach is over-charged and out of Or|der, and converts the &s;uperfluities of its Nouri&s;hment into bad Humours, which engender Di&s;ea&s;es and Death. I never knew a Man that lived long by this Conduct. The&s;e Men would doubt|le&s;s have prolonged their Days, had they abridged the Quantity of their ordinary Food proportionably as they grew in Years, and had they eaten a great deal le&s;s and a little oftner.</P>
<P>Some again are of Opinion, that So|briety may indeed pre&s;erve a Man in Health, but does not prolong his Life. To this we &s;ay, that there have been Per&s;ons in pa&s;t Ages who have pro|longed their Lives by this Means; and
<PB N="64" REF="89">&s;ome there are at pre&s;ent who &s;till do it. Our Days are as certainly &s;hortned by Intemperance, as In&s;irmities are contracted by Repletion; and a Mau of an ordinary reach may perceive that, if he de&s;ires to live long, it is better to be well than &s;ick; and that con&s;equently Temperance contributes more to a long Life than an exce&s;&s;ive Feeding.</P>
<P>What&s;oever the Sen&s;uali&s;ts may &s;ay, Temperance is of infinite Benefit to Mankind: To it he owes his Pre&s;erva|tion; it bani&s;hes from his Mind the di&s;mal apprehen&s;ion of dying; 'tis by its means that he becomes wi&s;e, and ar|rives to an Age wherein Rea&s;on and Experience furni&s;h him with A&s;&s;i&s;tance to free him&s;elf from the Tyranny of his Pa&s;&s;ions, which have lorded it over him for almo&s;t the whole Cour&s;e of his Life. O &s;acred and beneficent Tem|perance! How much am I obliged to thee for &s;eeing the Time which has &s;o many Charms, when one follows the Maxims, and ob&s;erves tho&s;e Rules which thou do&s;t pre&s;cribe? When I
<PB N="65" REF="90">denied my Sen&s;es nothing, I did not ta&s;te &s;uch refined Plea&s;ures, as now I enjoy. They were then &s;o trouble|&s;ome, and mixed with Pains, that even in the height of tho&s;e Enjoyments the Bitterne&s;s exceeded the Sweetne&s;s of them.</P>
<P>O happy State of Life! which, be|&s;ides other Ble&s;&s;ings with which thou favoure&s;t an old Man, do&s;t pre&s;erve his Stomach in &s;o perfect a Tone, as to make him reli&s;h a Piece of dry Bread better than the voluptuous do all their dainty Mor&s;els, and be&s;t &s;ea&s;oned Di&s;hes. The Appetite, which thou give&s;t us for Bread, is ju&s;t and rea&s;on|able, &s;ince 'tis the mo&s;t proper. Food for Mankind, when attended with a De&s;ire of eating. A &s;ober Life is ne|ver without &s;uch an Appetite. So that, by eating a little, my Stomach is often craving after the Manna, which I &s;ome|times reli&s;h with &s;o much Plea&s;ure, that I &s;hould think I tre&s;pa&s;s upon the Duty of Temperance, did I not know that one mu&s;t eat it to &s;upport Life, and
<PB N="66" REF="91">that one cannot make u&s;e of a plainer and a more natural Diet.</P>
<P>My Spirits are not injured by what I eat, they are only revived and &s;up|ported by it. I always find my&s;elf in an even Temper, always chearful, and more &s;o after, than before Meals. I u&s;e my&s;elf, pre&s;ently upon ri&s;ing from Table, to write or &s;tudy, and never find that this Application of Mind after eat|ing is prejudicial to me; for I am e|qually capable at all times of doing it, and never perceive my&s;elf drow&s;ie, as a great many People do. The Rea&s;on of this is, becau&s;e the little I eat is not &s;ufficient to &s;end up the Fumes from the Stomach to the Head, which fill the Brain, and render it incapable of performing its Functions.</P>
<P>What I eat is, as follows, <HI>viz,</HI> Bread, Soop, new-laid Eggs, Veal, Kid, Mutton, Partridges, Pullets and Pigeons. Among the Sea-fi&s;h I chu&s;e <HI>Goldenys,</HI> and of the River-fi&s;h the Pike. All the&s;e Aliments are proper for old Men, who, if they be wi&s;e for them&s;elves,
<PB N="67" REF="92">would be contented with the&s;e, and &s;eek for no other.</P>
<P>A poor old Man, who has not wherewith to purcha&s;e all the&s;e, &s;hould be &s;atisfied with Bread, Broth and Eggs; and there is no Man, how poor &s;oever he be, that can &s;tand in want of this Food, unle&s;s they be downright Beggars, reduced to live upon Alms, of whom I do not pretend to &s;ay any thing. The Rea&s;on of their being &s;o mi&s;erable in their old Age, is becau&s;e they were idle and lazy when they were young; it were better for them to die than to live, for they are a burthen to the World. But this we &s;ay, that a|nother Man in low Circum&s;tances, who has only Bread, Broth, and Eggs, ought not to eat much of them at a time; but &s;o to regulate him&s;elf with re&s;pect to the Quantity of his Diet, as that he may not die but by a mere Di&s;|&s;olution. For it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that a Stab, or the like, is the only vio|lent Death; Fevers, and a great many other Di&s;tempers of which one dies in
<PB N="68" REF="93">Bed are to be counted as &s;uch, being cau&s;ed by tho&s;e Humours again&s;t which Nature would not &s;truggle if they were natural.</P>
<P>What a Difference then is there be|tween a &s;ober and an intemperate life? The one &s;hortens, the other prolongs our Days, and makes us enjoy a perfect Health. How many of my Relations and Friends has Intemperance carried off, who would have been &s;till alive had they followed my Coun&s;el? But it has not been able to de&s;troy me, as it has &s;o many others; and becau&s;e I had the power of re&s;i&s;ting its Charms, I am &s;till in the Land of the living, and am arrived to a good old Age.</P>
<P>If I had not abandoned thee, thou infamous &s;ource of Corruption, I &s;hould never have had the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing eleven of my Grand-children, all of them witty and promi&s;ing; nor beheld the Ornaments which I have made to my Hou&s;es and Gardens. But thou, O cruel Intemperance! do&s;t of|ten put an end to the Days of thy Slaves,
<PB N="69" REF="94">before they could have fini&s;hed what they begun. They dare not undertake any thing that requires time to compleat it; and &s;hould they be &s;o happy as to &s;ee their Works brought to Perfection, yet they do not long enjoy the Fruit of their Labours. But to &s;hew what thou really art, <HI>viz.</HI> a deadly Poi&s;on, the mo&s;t dangerous Enemy of Mankind, and wi&s;hing that all Men may conceive a ju&s;t Abhorrence for thee, I pro|mi&s;e my&s;elf, that my eleven Grand-chil|dren will declare War again&s;t thee, and, following my Example will convince all Mankind of the Abu&s;e of thy Crav|ings, and of the U&s;efulne&s;s of a regular Cour&s;e of Life.</P>
<P>I cannot under&s;tand how it comes to pa&s;s that &s;o many People, otherwi&s;e prudent and rational, cannot re&s;olve up|on laying a re&s;traint upon their in&s;ati|able Appetites at fifty or three&s;core Years of Age, or at lea&s;t when they begin to feel the Infirmities of old Age coming upon them. They might rid them&s;elves of them by a &s;trict Diet; for
<PB N="70" REF="95">they become incurable, becau&s;e they will not ob&s;erve a Regimen. I do not wonder &s;o much that young People are &s;o hardly brought to &s;uch a Re&s;olution; they are not capable enough of reflec|ting, and their Judgment is not folid enough to re&s;i&s;t the Charms of Sen&s;e: But at fifty a Man ought to be govern|ed by his Rea&s;on, which would con|vince us, if we would hearken to it, that to gratify all our Appetites, without any Rule or Mea&s;ure, is the way to become infirm and to die young. Nor does the Plea&s;ure of Ta&s;te la&s;t long, it hardly begins but 'tis gone and pa&s;t; the more one eats, the more one may, and the Di&s;tempers which it brings a|long with it la&s;t us to our Graves. Now, &s;hould not a Sober Man be very well &s;atisfied when he is at Table, upon the A&s;&s;urance that as often as he ri&s;es from it, what he eats will do him no harm?</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> A Letter to Seignior <HI>Barbaro,</HI> Patri|arch of <HI>Aquileia;</HI> concerning the Me|thod of enjoying a compleat Happine&s;s in old Age.</HEAD>
<P>IT mu&s;t needs be owned that the Mind of Man is one of the greate&s;t Works of God, and that it is the Ma|&s;ter-piece of the divine Architect. Is it not &s;omething &s;urpri&s;ing to be able by writing to keep up a Corre&s;pon|dence with one's Friends at a Di&s;tance? And is not our Nature of a wonderful Compo&s;ition, which affords us the Means of &s;eeing one another with the Eyes of our Imagination, as I (Sir)
<PB N="72" REF="97">behold you at pre&s;ent? 'Tis after this Manner that I &s;hall enter into Di&s;cour&s;e with you, and relate to you &s;everal plea&s;ing and profitable things.</P>
<P>'Tis true indeed that what I have to tell you, is no News with re&s;pect to the &s;ubject Matter thereof; but I never told it you at the Age of ninety one Years. 'Tis &s;omewhat a&s;toni&s;hing, that I am able to tell you, that my Health and Strength are in &s;o good a plight, that in&s;tead of dimini&s;hing with my Age, they &s;eem to encrea&s;e as I grow old. All mine Acquaintance are &s;urprized at it, and I, who know to what I am indebted for this Happine&s;s, do every where declare the Cau&s;e of it. I en|deavour all I can to convince all Man|kind that a Man may enjoy a compleat Happine&s;s in this World after the Age of four&s;core, and this cannot be attain|ed without Continence and Sobriety, which are two Virtues precious in the Eyes of God, becau&s;e they are Ene|mies to our &s;en&s;ual Appetites, and Friends to our pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="98">Be plea&s;ed then, Sir, to know, that for &s;ome Days pa&s;t, &s;everal Doctors of our Univer&s;ity, as well Phy&s;icians as Philo&s;ophers, came to be informed by me of the Method I took in my Diet; having under&s;tood that I was &s;till health|ful and &s;trong, that I had my Sen&s;es perfect, that my Memory, my Heart, my Judgment, the Tone of my Voice, and my Teeth, were all as &s;ound as in my Youth; that I wrote &s;even or eight Hours a Day with my own Hand, and &s;pent the re&s;t of the Day in walking out on Foot, and in taking all the innocent Plea&s;ures that are allowed to a Virtuous Man; even Mu&s;ick it&s;elf, in which I bear my Part.</P>
<P>Ah Sir! how &s;weet a Voice would you perceive mine to be, were you to hear me, like another <HI>David,</HI> chant forth the Prai&s;es of God to the Sound of my Lyre? You would certainly be &s;urprized and charmed with the Harmony which I make. Tho&s;e Gentlemen particular|ly admired, with what ea&s;ine&s;s I could write upon Subjects, which required a
<PB N="74" REF="99">great and earne&s;t Application of Mind, and which were &s;o far from fatiguing, that they diverted me. You need not que&s;tion, but that, taking up my Pen to have the Honour of entertaining you to day, the Plea&s;ure which I conceive in &s;uch an Employment is far more plea|&s;ing and delightful to me, than tho&s;e which I am u&s;ed to take.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Doctors told me that I ought not to be looked upon as an old Man, &s;ince all my Works and Employments were &s;uch as were proper for a Youth, and did by no Means re&s;emble the Works of Men advanced in Years; who are capable of doing nothing after four|&s;core, who are loaded with Infirmities and Di&s;tempers, who are perpetually langui&s;hing and in pain.</P>
<P>That if there be any of them who are le&s;s infirm, yet their Sen&s;es are decay|ed; their Sight and Hearing fail them, their Legs tremble, and their Hands &s;hake, they can no longer walk, nor are they capable of doing any thing: And &s;hould there chance to be One
<PB N="75" REF="100">that is free from tho&s;e Di&s;a&s;ters, his Memory decrea&s;es, his Spirits &s;ink, and his Heart fails him; in &s;hort, he does not enjoy Life &s;o perfectly as I do. What they wondered at mo&s;t was a thing that is really &s;urprizing. It is this, that, by an invincible &s;ort of An|tipathy, I cannot drink any Wine what&s;oever during the Months of <HI>July</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> every Year. I have &s;o great an Aver&s;ion to it, that I &s;hould certainly die, did I but force my&s;elf to drink any; for neither my Stomach nor my Palate can bear it; &s;o that Wine being as it were Mother's Milk to old Men, it &s;eems as if I could not po&s;&s;ibly pre&s;erve my Life without that Nouri&s;h|ment. My Stomach then being de|prived of a Help &s;o u&s;eful and proper for the maintaining the Heat thereof, I could eat but a very little, which about the middle of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> brought me &s;o low and weak, that Jelly Broths and Cordials could not keep up my Spirits. However this Weakne&s;s is not attended with any Pain or pernicious accident.
<PB N="76" REF="101">Our Doctors were of Opinion, that if the New Wine, which re&s;tores me per|fectly to my Health in the Beginning of <HI>September,</HI> were not made at that time I could never e&s;cape Death. They were no le&s;s &s;urprized to &s;ee that, in three or four Days time, new Wine had re&s;tored to me that Strength which I had lo&s;t by drinking of the old; a thing of which they were Witne&s;&s;es the&s;e Days pa&s;t, when they &s;aw me in tho&s;e two different Circum&s;tances, with|out which they could never have belie|ved it.</P>
<P>Several Phy&s;icians were plea&s;ed to progno&s;ticate to me, ten Years ago, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to hold out two or three Years longer with this pernicious Antipathy: However I &s;till find my&s;elf le&s;s weak than ever, and am &s;tronger this Year than any that went before. This &s;ort of Miracle, and the many Favours which I receive from God, obliged them to tell me that I brought along with me at my Birth an extraordinary, and &s;pecial Gift of Na|ture;
<PB N="77" REF="102">and for the Proof of their Opini|on, they employed all their Rhetorick, and made &s;everal elegant Speeches upon that head. It mu&s;t be acknowledged, my Lord, that Eloquence has a great deal of force upon the Mind of Man, &s;ince it often per&s;uades to believe that which never was, and never could be. I was very much di&s;plea&s;ed to hear them di&s;cour&s;e; and how could it be helped, &s;ince they were Men of Parts who ha|rangued at that rate? But that which delighted me mo&s;t was to reflect, that Age and Experience may render a Man wi&s;er than all the Golleges in the World can. The&s;e are two infallible Means of acquiring a clear Sight into things, and it was in truth by their Help, that I knew the Error of that Notion. To undeceive tho&s;e Gentlemen, and at the &s;ame time to in&s;truct them better, I re|plyed, that their Way of arguing was wrong: That the Favour I received was no &s;pecial, but a general and uni|ver&s;al one: That there was no Man alive but what may have received it as
<PB N="78" REF="103">well as my&s;elf: That I was but a Man as well as others: That we have all, be&s;ides our Exi&s;tence, a Judgement, a Mind and Rea&s;on: That we are all born with the&s;e &s;ame Faculties of the Soul; becau&s;e God was plea&s;ed that we &s;hould all of us have tho&s;e Advantages above the other Creatures, who have nothing in common with us but the U&s;e of their Sen&s;es: That the Creator has be&s;towed upon us this Rea&s;on and this Judgment to pre&s;erve our Lives, &s;o that this Grace proceeds immediately from God, and not from Nature or the Stars: That Man, when he is Young, being more &s;ubject to his Sen&s;e than to his Rea&s;on, gives him&s;elf up wholly to his Plea&s;ures, and that, when he is ar|rived to forty or fifty Years of Age, he ought to know that he is in the mid&s;t of his Life; thanks to the Goodne&s;s of his Con&s;titution which has carried him &s;o far: But that, when he is arrived to this Period, he goes down the Hill a|pace to meet his Death, of which the Infirmities of old Age are the forerun|ners:
<PB N="79" REF="104">That Old Age is as different from Youth, as a regular Life is oppo&s;ite to Intemperance: That 'tis nece&s;&s;ary for him, at that Age, to change his Cour&s;e of Life, e&s;pecially with re&s;pect to the Quantity and the Quality of his Diet; becau&s;e 'tis on that, the Health and Length of our Days do radically de|pend. That la&s;tly, if the former part of our Lives were altogether &s;en&s;ual, then the latter ought to be rational and regular; Order being nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ervation of all things, e&s;pe|cially the Life of Man, as may be per|ceived by tho&s;e Inconveniences that are cau&s;ed by exce&s;s, and by the Health|fulne&s;s of tho&s;e that ob&s;erve a &s;trict Re|gimen. In truth, my Lord, 'tis im|po&s;&s;ible for them, who will always gra|tifie their Ta&s;te and their Appetite, not to break their Con&s;titution; and that I might not break mine, when I was ar|rived to Maturity, I entirely devoted my&s;elf to a &s;ober Life. It is true, it was not without &s;ome Reluctancy that I entered upon the Re&s;olution, and a|bandoned
<PB N="80" REF="105">my profu&s;e Way of living. I began with praying to God, that he would grant me the Gift of Tempe|rance, and was fully per&s;uaded, that, how difficult &s;oever any Undertaking be which a Man &s;ets about, he will attain his End, if he has but Re&s;olution enough to conquer the Ob&s;tacles to his De&s;ign. By this means I rooted out my evil Habits, and contracted good Ones; &s;o that I u&s;ed my&s;elf to a Cour&s;e of Life, which was by &s;o much the more &s;evere and au&s;tere, by how much the more my Con&s;titution was become very weak, when I began it. In &s;hort, my Lord, when they had heard my Rea&s;ons, they were forced to &s;ubmit to them.</P>
<P>The younge&s;t among them told me, that he agreed that this Favour might be univer&s;al to all Men, but that it was very rarely efficacious, and that I mu&s;t needs have a more e&s;pecial and victori|ous Grace to get above the Delights and Cu&s;tom of an ea&s;y Life, and em|brace One that was quite contrary to
<PB N="81" REF="106">it: That he did not look upon it to be impo&s;&s;ible, &s;ince my Practice convinced him of the contrary, but however it &s;eemed to him to be very difficult.</P>
<P>I replyed to him, that it was a &s;hame to relinqui&s;h a good Undertaking upon the account of the Difficulties that might attend it, and that the more we met with, the more Glory &s;hould we ac|quire: That 'tis the Will of the Creator, that every one &s;hould attain to a long Life, to which he has appointed Man; becau&s;e in his old Age he might be freed from the bitter Fruits that were produced by Sen&s;e, and might enjoy the good Effects of his Rea&s;on, that then he &s;hakes Hands with his Vices, is no longer a Slave to the Devil, and finds him&s;elf in a better Condition of providing for the Salvation of his Soul: That God, who&s;e Goodne&s;s is infinite, has ordained that the Man who comes to the End of his Race &s;hould end his Life without any Di&s;temper, and by a pure Di&s;&s;olution, which only ought to be called natural Death; all others
<PB N="82" REF="107">being violent and brought upon Men by Repletion and Exce&s;s. That la&s;tly, God is willing that Man &s;hould pa&s;s, by &s;o &s;weet and ea&s;y a Death, to a Life of Immortality and Glory, which I ex|pect. I hope, &s;aid I to him, to die &s;inging the Prai&s;es of my Creator. The &s;ad Reflection, that we mu&s;t one Day cea&s;e to live, is no di&s;turbance to me, tho' I ea&s;ily perceive, that, at my Age, that fatal Day cannot be far from me; that as certainly as I was born &s;o I mu&s;t die, and that many thou&s;ands of younger Per&s;ons than my&s;elf are departed this Life before me; nor am I affraid of the Terrors of Hell, becau&s;e I am a Chri|&s;tian, and put my tru&s;t in the Mercy and Merits of the Blood of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t:</HI> La&s;tly, I hope that &s;o plea&s;ant a Life as mine will be followed by as happy a Death.</P>
<P>To this the young Gentleman replied not a Word, only that he was re&s;olved to lead a &s;ober Life, that he might live and die as happily as I hoped to do; and that, tho' hitherto he had wi&s;hed to
<PB N="83" REF="108">be young a long time, yet now he de|&s;ired to be quickly old, that he might enjoy the Plea&s;ures of &s;uch an admirable Age.</P>
<P>The De&s;ire I had of giving you, my Lord, a long Entertainment, as being one with whom I could never be weary, has inclined me to write this long Let|ter to you, and to add one Word more before I conclude.</P>
<P>Some &s;en&s;ual Per&s;ons give out, that I have troubled my&s;elf to no purpo&s;e in compo&s;ing a Treati&s;e concerning Sobri|ety, and that I have lo&s;t my time in endeavouring to per&s;uade Men to the Practice of that which is impo&s;&s;ible: That my Advices will prove as u&s;ele&s;s as the Laws which <HI>Plato</HI> would have e&s;tabli&s;hed in his Commonwealth, the Execution of which was &s;o difficult, that he could never prevail upon any Man to receive them: and that what I have written upon this Subject will meet with no better Succe&s;s. I find this Compari&s;on is by no Means ju&s;t, &s;ince I practi&s;ed what I teach a great
<PB N="84" REF="109">many Years before I wrote upon it, that I would never have put Pen to Paper had I not known by my own Experience, that this Practice was not impo&s;&s;ible, that it is likewi&s;e very u&s;e|ful, and very prudent, and this was the Motive which prevailed upon me to publi&s;h it. In a Word, I have been the Occa&s;ion of a great many Per&s;ons practi&s;ing it, who find them&s;elves the better for &s;o doing, &s;o that the Laws of <HI>Plato</HI> have no re&s;emblance to the Advices which I give. But &s;uch Per|&s;ons who deny them&s;elves nothing that they may gratify their Sen&s;es do not care to give me their Approbation. How|ever I pity the&s;e Men, tho' they de&s;erve for their Intemperance to be tormented in their old Days with a Complication of Di&s;tempers, and to be the Victims of their Pa&s;&s;ions a whole Eternity. I am, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of the Birth and Death of Man.</HEAD>
<P>THAT I may not be deficient in that Duty of Charity, which all Men owe to one another, or lo&s;e one Moment of that Plea&s;ure which the en|joyment of Life affords; I will again write to inform tho&s;e, who do not know me, of what they who are acquainted with me have known and &s;een. What I am going to &s;ay will be looked upon as impo&s;&s;ible or incredible: But at the &s;ame time nothing is more certain; it being what a great many know, and what is worthy to be admired by all Po&s;terity. I am now ninety five Years of Age, and find my&s;elf as healthful, bri&s;k, and airy, as if I were but twenty five Years old.</P>
<P>What Ingratitude &s;hould I be guilty of! did I not return Thanks to the Divine Goodne&s;s for all his Mercies
<PB N="86" REF="111">reached out unto me? Mo&s;t of your old Men have &s;carce arrived to &s;ixty, but they find them&s;elves loaded with Infirmities. They are melancholy, unhealthful, always full of the frightful Apprehen&s;ions of dying: They tremble Day and Night for Fear of being with|in one Foot of their Graves; and are &s;o &s;trongly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the Fancy of it, that 'tis a hard Matter to divert them, but for a Moment, from that doleful Thought. Ble&s;&s;ed be God, I am free from their Ills and Terrors. Tis my Opinion, that I ought not as yet to a|bandon my&s;elf to that vain Fear. This I will make appear by the Sequel, and will al&s;o evince how certain I am of li|ving an hundred Years. But that I may ob&s;erve a Method in the Subject I am treating of, I will begin with the Birth of Man, and end with his Death.</P>
<P>I &s;ay then, that &s;ome Bodies are born with &s;o bad a Con&s;titution, that they live but few Days or Months. Whether this proceeds from the bad Con&s;titutions
<PB N="87" REF="112">of the Parents, or from the Influences of the Stars, or from a weakne&s;s of Na|ture, which derives this Defect from &s;ome foreign Cau&s;e, is hard to deter|mine. For 'tis not likely, that Nature, as &s;he is the common Parent of all Man|kind, &s;hould be guilty of over-fondne&s;s to &s;ome of her Children, and of cruelty to wards others.</P>
<P>Since we are not able to di&s;cover the true Rea&s;on from whence the &s;hortne&s;s of our Lives proceeds, it is in vain to enquire into the Cau&s;e of it; 'tis enough to know, that there are Bodies which die almo&s;t as &s;oon as they are born.</P>
<P>Others are born well &s;haped and healthful, but of a tender Make; and &s;ome of the&s;e live ten, twenty, thirty, or forty Years, without being able to attain to that Period which is called old Age.</P>
<P>Others there are, who bring along with them a &s;trong Con&s;titution into the World, and they indeed get to be old; but then they are very decrepid and un|healthful, as hath been already ob&s;er|ved,
<PB N="88" REF="113">bringing upon them&s;elves all the Di&s;tempers they labour under; becau&s;e they tru&s;ted too much to the Strength of their Con&s;titution. They are un|willing to alter their Cour&s;e of Life, and make no difference between their being old and young, as if they were to be as vigorous at four&s;core as in the Flower of their Days. By this Means, they never correct their Conduct, nor make any Reflexion that they are old, that their Con&s;titution decays, that their Stomach lo&s;es every Day &s;omething of its natural Heat; and for that Rea&s;on they ought to be more careful both of the Quality and Quantity of what they eat and drink. They are of Opinion, that a Man's Strength impairing as he grows in Years, he ought to repair and &s;upport it by a greater Quantity of Food; they fancy that to eat a great deal pre&s;erves their Lives; but therein they are mi&s;taken; for the natural Heat beginning to decay, they over-charge it with too much Food, and Prudence requires that a Man &s;hould proportion
<PB N="89" REF="114">his Diet to his dige&s;tive Faculties. This is certain, that the peccant Humours proceed only from an imperfect dige|&s;tion, and there is but little good Chyle made, when the Stomach is charged with fre&s;h Aliments, before it has thrown off the former Meal's Meat in|to the Inte&s;tines. It cannot then be urged too often, that, when the natural Heat begins to decay, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary for the Pre&s;ervation of Health to abate the Quantity of what one eats and drinks every Day; Nature requiring but very little for the Support of the Life of Man, e&s;pecially that of an old Man.</P>
<P>However in&s;tead of taking this Cour&s;e, mo&s;t old People continue to live as they did formerly. If they had &s;tinted them&s;elves in time, they would at lea&s;t have arrived to my Years, and enjoyed as long a life as my&s;elf, &s;ince they brought into the World a &s;trong Con&s;titution. They might have lived &s;o long at lea&s;t, I &s;ay; for they might have arrived to &s;ix &s;core, as a great many others who lived &s;oberly have
<PB N="90" REF="115">done, whom we have known our&s;elves, or have heard of by Tradition, provid|ed always that they had as happy a Con&s;titution as tho&s;e People. Had I been as well made, I would not que|&s;tion but I might prolong my Days to that Date; but becau&s;e I was born with a tender Con&s;titution, I cannot hope to live above a Century: and even they who are of no &s;tronger a Make than my&s;elf may, by living &s;oberly as I do, ea&s;ily attain to the &s;ame Period.</P>
<P>Nothing &s;eems more delightful than this certainty of a long life, whil&s;t the re&s;t of Mankind, who ob&s;erve not the Rules of &s;obriety, are not &s;ure of &s;eeing the next Day. This Expectation of a long life is founded on &s;uch natural Con&s;equences as can never fail. It is next to impo&s;&s;ible, that he who leads a regular and &s;ober Life &s;hould fall &s;ick, or die a natural Death before the time that Nature has pre&s;cribed. I &s;ay he cannot die before that time, becau&s;e a &s;ober Life prevents that Corruption which feeds our Di&s;tempers, which
<PB N="91" REF="116">cannot be produced without a Cau&s;e; and if there is no bad one reigning, there can be no fatal Effect, or violent Death.</P>
<P>There is no que&s;tion to be made, but that a regular Life puts at a Di&s;tance the &s;ad Hour of our Death; &s;ince it is able to keep the Humours in an exact Tem|perature: whereas on the contrary, gluttony and drunkenne&s;s di&s;turbs, heats and puts them into a Ferment; which is the Origin of Catarrhs, Fevers, and almo&s;t all the Accidents which hurry us to our Graves.</P>
<P>However, tho' Sobriety, which pre|&s;erves us from abundance of Di&s;a&s;ters, may repair what Exce&s;s has impaired, yet it mu&s;t not be &s;uppo&s;ed that it will make a Man immortal. It is impo&s;&s;ible but that time, which effaces all things, &s;hould likewi&s;e de&s;troy the mo&s;t curious Workman&s;hip of Nature. That which had a Beginning mu&s;t needs have an End; but Man ought to end his Days by a natural Death, that is, without any Pain, as they will &s;ee me die when
<PB N="92" REF="117">the radical Moi&s;ture &s;hall be quite ex|hau&s;ted.</P>
<P>I find this Principle of Life &s;till &s;o perfect in me, that I promi&s;e my&s;elf &s;till to be at &s;ome di&s;tance from my la&s;t day; and I fancy I am not mi&s;taken; becau&s;e I am healthful and bri&s;k, re|li&s;h all I eat, &s;leep quietly, and, in a word, none of my Sen&s;es fail me. I have &s;till a lively Fancy, a happy Me|mory, a &s;ound Judgment, a &s;trong Heart, and my Voice is more tuneable than ever, (tho' the fir&s;t Organ that fails) &s;o that I can chant forth my Of|fice every Morning, without any preju|dice to my Lungs, and more ea&s;ily than I could in my youth.</P>
<P>All the&s;e are infallible Signs that I have a great while &s;till to live; but that my life &s;hall end, whenever it plea&s;es God. How glorious will it then be, having been attended with all the Happine&s;s this World can afford, &s;ince Age has freed me from the &s;lavery of my Pa&s;&s;ions? A prudent and regular old Age conquers and cradicates them, pre|vents
<PB N="93" REF="118">them from bringing forth any en|venomed Fruits, and changes all the ill thoughts which Youth in&s;pires into tho&s;e that are good,</P>
<P>Being no longer a Slave to Sen&s;e, I am not troubled with the thoughts that my Soul &s;hall one Day be &s;eparated from my Body. I am no longer di&s;turbed with anxious Fears, and racking Cares, nor vexed at the Lo&s;s of that which is not really mine. The Death of my Friends and Relations occa&s;ions no o|ther Grief in me, than that of the fir&s;t Movement of Nature, which cannot be avoided, but is of no long Conti|nuance.</P>
<P>I am &s;till le&s;s moved at the Lo&s;s of any temporal Good, &s;o afflictive to a great many Per&s;ons. This is only the Happine&s;s of tho&s;e that grow old by Sobriety, and not of tho&s;e Per&s;ons, who, by Virtue of a &s;trong Con&s;titution, ar|rive to &s;uch an Age, notwith&s;tanding their Exce&s;&s;es. The one enjoys a fore|ta&s;te of Heaven even in this World, whil&s;t the other can not reli&s;h any plea|&s;ure
<PB N="94" REF="119">without a great deal of trouble. Who would not think him&s;elf happy at my Age never to be &s;en&s;ible of the lea&s;t Inconvenience? A happine&s;s which &s;eldom attends the mo&s;t flouri&s;h|ing Youth. There are none of them but what are &s;ubject to a thou&s;and Di&s;|orders, which I know nothing of: On the contrary, I enjoy a thou&s;and plea&s;ures, which are as pure as they are calm.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e, is to be &s;ervice|able to my Country; and how does this Plea&s;ure innocently flatter my Va|nity! When I reflect, how I have fur|ni&s;hed my Countrymen with u&s;eful means both of fortifying their City, and their Port: That the&s;e Works will &s;ub|&s;i&s;t for many Ages; that they will con|duce to the making of <HI>Venice</HI> a famous Republick, a rich and matchle&s;s City, and &s;erve to eternize its fair Title of being Queen of the Sea.</P>
<P>I have likewi&s;e the Satisfaction of having afforded to her Inhabitants, the means of always obtaining plenty of
<PB N="95" REF="120">all things nece&s;&s;ary for Life; by manu|ring untilled Lands, draining the Mar&s;h|es, by laying under Water, and fattening the Fields, which were barren by rea&s;on of the Dryne&s;s of the Soil, which would otherwi&s;e have been a Work of Time.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I have rendered the City wherein I was born, &s;tronger, richer, and more beautiful than ever, as al&s;o the Air more whole&s;om; all which is to my Credit, and nothing hinders me from enjoying the Glory which is due unto me.</P>
<P>My Misfortune having robbed me of a con&s;iderable E&s;tate whil&s;t I was young, I knew how to make amends for that lo&s;s by my care; &s;o that with|out the lea&s;t wrong done to any Per&s;on, and without any other trouble than that of giving forth the Orders that were nece&s;&s;ary, I have doubled my Income, and &s;hall leave to my Grand-children twice the E&s;tate that I had by Inheri|tance from my Ance&s;tors.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="121">One Satisfaction, which plea&s;es me more than all the re&s;t, is, that what I have written concerning Sobriety is of great u&s;e to many, who loudly proclaim how highly they are obliged to me for that Work: Several of them having &s;ent me word from foreign Parts, that, under God, they have been indebted to me for their Lives.</P>
<P>I have likewi&s;e another Satisfaction, the being deprived of which would very much di&s;turb me; which is, that I write, and draw with my own Hand all that is proper for my Buildings, and for the Conduct of my dome&s;tick Affairs.</P>
<P>I likewi&s;e frequently conver&s;e with Men of Learning, from whom I daily receive new Knowledge. And 'tis a wonder, that, at my Age, I &s;hould have &s;o quick parts as to learn and compre|hend the mo&s;t refined and difficult of Sciences.</P>
<P>But that which makes me look upon my&s;elf as one of the happie&s;t of Men, is, that in &s;ome Mea&s;ure I enjoy two
<PB N="97" REF="122">&s;orts of Lives; the one terre&s;trial, with re&s;pect to the Actions of the Body; and the other divine and cele&s;tial, by the plea&s;ures of the Mind; which are attended with a great many Charms, when founded on rea&s;onable Objects, and a moral A&s;&s;urance of the infinite good things which the divine Bounty prepares for us.</P>
<P>I enjoy then perfectly the Plea&s;ures of this mortal Life, Thanks to Sobrie|ty, which is extremely grateful to God, as being the Guardian of Virtue, and an irreconcilable Enemy to Vice; and by way of Foreta&s;te I enjoy eternal Life, by contemplating &s;o often on the Happine&s;s thereof, that I can hardly think upon any thing el&s;e. I look u|pon Death as the nece&s;&s;ary Pa&s;&s;age to Heaven, and am &s;o far charmed with the glorious Elevation to which I think my Soul is de&s;igned, that I can no longer &s;loop to tho&s;e Trifles, which charm and infatuate the greate&s;t part of Mankind. The Deprivation of tho&s;e Plea&s;ures to which I was mo&s;t addicted
<PB N="98" REF="123">gives me no Di&s;quiet; on the contrary the Lo&s;s of them rai&s;es my Joy, &s;ince it is to be the Beginning of a Life in|comparably more happy.</P>
<P>Who then would be troubled if he were in my Place? However, there is not a Man but may hope for the like Happine&s;s, if he would live as I do. For in &s;hort, I am neither Saint nor Angel, but only a Man, the Servant of God, to whom a &s;ober and regular Life is &s;o grateful, that even in this World he rewards tho&s;e who practi&s;e it.</P>
<P>If all they who retire into Mona&s;te|ries, to lead there a Penitent Life, a Life of Prayer and Contemplation, would, to all their Virtues, add the Pru|dence of abridging them&s;elves in their Diet, they would become more de&s;er|ving and more venerable.</P>
<P>They would be looked upon as Saints by per&s;evering in their Au&s;terities, and e&s;teemed as tho&s;e old Partriarchs and an|cient Hermits, who ob&s;erved a con&s;tant Sobriety, and lived &s;o long a Time.
<PB N="99" REF="124">They might very probably obtain at the Age of &s;ix&s;core &s;o much Grace as to be able to work Miracles, which they could not do for want of &s;uch a perfection, to which they could not ar|rive before that time. And be&s;ides this Privilege, which is almo&s;t an infal|lible Mark of Prede&s;tination, they would be in con&s;tant Health, which is as rarely to be met with in the old Age of the mo&s;t pious Monks, as in that of the greate&s;t part of the wi&s;e&s;t World|lings.</P>
<P>Several of tho&s;e Monks fancy that God does on purpo&s;e annex Infirmities to old Age, to &s;erve in&s;tead of Penance impo&s;ed for the Sins committed in their Youth: But therein, as I think, they are very much mi&s;taken; For I can|not imagine how God, who loves Man|kind, can be delighted in their Sufferings. 'Tis the Devil and Sin which brings all the Evils we &s;uffer upon our Heads, and not God, who is our Father and Creator. He de&s;ires that Mankind &s;hould be happy both in this, and in the
<PB N="100" REF="125">other World: His Commands tend to no other Purpo&s;e, and Temperance would not be a Virtue, if the Benefit it does us by pre&s;erving us from Di&s;tempers were repugnant to the De&s;igns of God in our old Age.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, if all the truly pious were &s;ober, Chri&s;tendom would be as full of Saints as in the primitive Times; nay, they would be more numerous, becau&s;e the Number of Chri&s;tians is increa&s;ed &s;ince that Time. How many venerable Doctors might edifie others by their whole&s;om Preachings and good Ex|amples? How many Sinners might re|ceive Benefit by their Interce&s;&s;ions? How many Ble&s;&s;ings might they &s;hower upon the Earth? The&s;e Monks, in ob|&s;erving the Maxims which I profe&s;s, need not fear acting contrary to tho&s;e of their own Rules.</P>
<P>There is not one that forbids them the u&s;e of Bread, Wine and Eggs; &s;ome al&s;o permit them to eat fle&s;h. Be&s;ides the&s;e things, they make u&s;e of Sallads Pul&s;e, Fruit, Cakes, which are pre|judicial
<PB N="101" REF="126">to &s;ome Stomachs. Becau&s;e the&s;e Me&s;&s;es are offered to them in the Refectory, they may perhaps be afraid of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing their Rule, if they &s;hould ab&s;tain from them. However they would have done better if thirty Years ago they had ab&s;tained from that Diet, and contented them&s;elves with Bread, Wine, Broths and Eggs, which are the be&s;t Food a tender Body can take. Would not this be better than the Nou|ri&s;hment of the ancient Fathers in the De&s;art, who drank nothing but fair Water, did eat only wild Fruit, Herbs, and raw Roots, yet lived a long time without Infirmities? Our Anchorets would likewi&s;e find a more ea&s;ie Way to Heaven, than tho&s;e of <HI>Thebais.</HI></P>
<P>I will conclude all with &s;aying, that &s;ince extreme old Age may be &s;o u&s;e|ful and plea&s;ant to Men, I &s;hould have failed in point of Charity, had I not taken Care to inform them by what Methods they might prolong their Days. I have had no other Motive in writing upon this Subject, than that of engaging them
<PB N="102" REF="127">to practi&s;e, all their Lives, a Virtue which would bring them like me to a happy old Age, in which I will not cea&s;e to cry, live, live long, to the end you may &s;erve God, and be fit for the Glo|ry which he prepares for his Elect.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Being a Letter from a Nun of <HI>Padua,</HI> the Grand-daughter of <HI>Lewis Cor|naro.</HI></HEAD>
<P>LEWIS CORNARO was by the ill Conduct of &s;ome of his Relations deprived of the Dignity of a noble <HI>Ve|netian,</HI> of which he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and which he de&s;erved for his Virtues, and by his Birth. He was not bani&s;hed from his Country, but was free to re|main in <HI>Venice</HI> if he plea&s;ed; but &s;eeing him&s;elf excluded from all the publick Employments of the Republick, he retired to <HI>Padua,</HI> where he took up his Re&s;idence.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="128">He married at <HI>Udine</HI> a City of <HI>Friuli;</HI> his Wife's Name was <HI>Veronica,</HI> of the Family of the <HI>Spilembergs.</HI> She was a long time barren, and as he ardently wi&s;hed for Children, he neglected no|thing which might give him that Sati&s;|faction. At la&s;t, after many Vows, Prayers and Remedies, his Wife be|came pregnant, and was delivered of a Daughter, who was named <HI>Clara,</HI> be|cau&s;e of the Devotion which each of them had for Saint <HI>Francis.</HI></P>
<P>This was an only Daughter, and was married to <HI>John Cornaro,</HI> the Son of <HI>Fantin,</HI> of the Family of that Name, which was di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Sirname of <HI>Cornaro dell Epi&s;copia.</HI> It was a very powerful Family before the Lo&s;s which Chri&s;tendom &s;uffered by lo&s;ing the Kingdom of <HI>Cyprus,</HI> where that Family had a con&s;iderable E&s;tate.</P>
<P><HI>Clara</HI> had eleven Children, eight Sons and three Daughters. <HI>Lewis Cornaro</HI> had al&s;o the plea&s;ure to &s;ee him&s;elf, as it were, revived by a Mi|racle in a great Number of Succe&s;&s;ors;
<PB N="104" REF="129">for tho' he was very ancient when <HI>Clara</HI> came into the World, yet he lived to &s;ee her very old, and his Off&s;pring to the third Generation.</P>
<P><HI>Cornaro</HI> was a Man of Under&s;tand|ing, Merit and Courage. He loved Glory, and was naturally liberal, ne|verthele&s;s without profu&s;ene&s;s. His Youth was infirm, being very pa&s;&s;io|nate and ha&s;ty: but when he perceived what Damage the Vices of his Tem|per cau&s;ed him, he re&s;olved to correct them, and had Command enough of him&s;elf to conquer his Pa&s;&s;ion, and tho&s;e extravagant Humours to which he was &s;ubject. After this glorious Victory, he became &s;o moderate, mild, and affable that he gained the E&s;teem and Friend&s;hip of all that knew him.</P>
<P>He was extraordinary &s;ober, and ob&s;erved the Rules which he mentions in his Writings, and dieted him&s;elf al|ways with &s;o much Wi&s;dom and pre|caution, that, finding his natural Heat decaying by degrees in his old Age, he al&s;o dimini&s;hed his Diet by degrees,
<PB N="105" REF="130">&s;o far as to &s;tint him&s;elf to the Yolk of an Egg for a Meal, and &s;ometimes, a little before his Death, it &s;erved him for two Meals.</P>
<P>By this Means he pre&s;erved his Health, and was al&s;o vigorous to the Age of an hundred Years; his Mind did not decay, he never had need of Spectacles, neither lo&s;t he his Hear|ing.</P>
<P>And that which is no le&s;s true than difficult to beleive is, that he pre&s;erved his Voice &s;o clear and harmonious, that at the end of his Life he &s;ung with as much Strength and Delight as he did at the Age of twenty five Years.</P>
<P>He had fore&s;een that he &s;hould live long without any Infirmity, and was not deceived in it. When he felt that his la&s;t Hour drew near, he di&s;po&s;ed him&s;elf to leave this Life with the Piety of a Chri&s;tian, and the Courage of a Philo&s;opher. He made his Will, and &s;et all his Affairs in Order; after which he received the la&s;t Sacraments, and expected Death patiently in an Elbow|chair.
<PB N="106" REF="131">In &s;hort, it may be &s;aid that being in good Health, feeling no man|ner of Pain, having al&s;o his Mind and Eye very bri&s;k, a little fainting Fit took him, which was in&s;tead of an Agony, and made him fetch his la&s;t Breath. He died at <HI>Padua,</HI> 26th of <HI>April</HI> 1566, and was buried the 8th of <HI>May</HI> follow|ing.</P>
<P>His Wife died &s;ome Years after him. Her life was long, and her old Age as happy as that of her Spou&s;e, only her latter Days were not altogether like his. Some Time before her Death She was &s;eized with a lingring which brought her to her Grave. She gave up her Soul one Night in her Bed without any convul&s;ive Motions, and with &s;o per|fect Tranquility, that She left this Life without being perceived.</P>
<P>This is all I can &s;ay of tho&s;e good People, by the Idea which remains of them, from what I heard my decca&s;ed Father, and &s;ome other Friends of <HI>Lewis Cornaro,</HI> &s;ay of them; who ha|ving lived &s;o long after an extraordinary

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Authorities taken from the Hi&s;tory of <HI>M. de Thou;</HI> and the Dialogues of <HI>Cardan,</HI> concerning <HI>Cornaro's</HI> Method of prolonging a Man's Life, and pre|&s;erving his Health.</HEAD>
<P>THE Extract of the 38th Book of the Hi&s;tory of <HI>M. Pre&s;ident de Thou,</HI> runs thus:</P>
<Q><P><HI>Lewis Cornaro</HI> was an extraordi|nary and admirable In&s;tance of a long Life; for he lived an hundred Years, healthful in Body and &s;ound in Mind. He was de&s;cended from one of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious Families of <HI>Venice;</HI> but through &s;ome Misfortune owing to his Birth, he was excluded from all Honours and publick Employ|ments in the State. He married at <HI>Udine</HI> in <HI>Friuli</HI> one <HI>Veronica,</HI> of the
<PB N="108" REF="133">Family of <HI>Spilemberg,</HI> and being in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a good E&s;tate, he was very de&s;irous of having Children to inherit it. In &s;hort, what by the Prayers he put up, and by the Help of Phy&s;icians, he conquered the Point, and his Wife whom he dearly loved, and who was pretty well gone in Years, was brought to Bed of a Daughter, when he lea&s;t of all ex|pected it. This Daughter named <HI>Clara</HI> was married to <HI>John</HI> the Son of <HI>Fantini Cornaro,</HI> a rich Family of <HI>Cyprus,</HI> by whom &s;he had eight Sons and three Daughters.</P>
<P>In a word, <HI>Lewis Cornaro</HI> by his Sobriety, and the Regimen he ob&s;er|ved in his Diet, corrected the Infir|mities he had contracted by Intem|perance in his Youth, and by the Strength of his Rea&s;on moderated his Inclination and Propen&s;ity to Anger. So that in his old Age he had as good a Con&s;titution of Body, and as mild and even tempered a Mind, as before in the flower of his
<PB N="109" REF="134">Youth he was infirm, and apt to fly out into a Pa&s;&s;ion. He compo&s;ed &s;everal Treati&s;es when he was very old, wherein he tells us of the irre|gularity of his former Life, and of his Reformation, and the Hopes he had of living long. Nor was he mi&s;taken in his Account, for he died calmly and without any Pain, being above an hundred Years old, at <HI>Pa|dua,</HI> where he had taken up his Re|&s;idence. His Wife almo&s;t as old as him&s;elf &s;urvived him. but, within a &s;hort time after, died a very ea&s;y Death. They were both buried in St. <HI>Anthony's</HI> Church without any Pomp, according as they had order|ed by their la&s;t Will and Te&s;tament.</P></Q>
<P>In the Dialogue of <HI>Cardan,</HI> between a Philo&s;opher, a Citizen, and an Her|mit, concerning the Methods of pro|longing a Mans Life, and pre&s;erving his Health, <HI>Cardan</HI> introduces the Her|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t di&s;cour&s;ing thus:</P>
<Q><P>Whereas in &s;olid Nouri&s;hments, and even in Drinks, there are &s;everal
<PB N="110" REF="135">things worthy our Ob&s;ervation: <HI>viz.</HI> their natural Qualities and tho&s;e which they acquire by the &s;ea&s;oning of them, the Order and the Time wherein we ought to make U&s;e of them, without mentioning the Quan|tity of tho&s;e very Aliments and Drinks: it is not without Rea&s;on that the Que&s;tion is a&s;ked, which of the&s;e things is to be regarded mo&s;t?</P>
<P>Some have declared them&s;elves for the Quantity, maintaining that it has in Effect a greater Share than any other thing in the Pre&s;ervation of Health and Life.</P>
<P>The famous <HI>Lewis Cornaro,</HI> a noble <HI>Venetian,</HI> was of this Mind. He treated on this Subject at the Age of four&s;core, enjoying then a perfect &s;oundne&s;s of Body and Mind. This venerable old Man, at the Age of thirty &s;ix, was &s;eized with &s;o vio|lent a Di&s;temper, that his Life was de&s;paired of. Ever after that time, he took care to eat ju&s;t the &s;ame Quantity every Meal: and tho' he
<PB N="111" REF="136">was not free from a great many Fa|tigues, and &s;ome Misfortunes which occa&s;ioned his Brothers Death, yet the exactne&s;s of his Regimen pre&s;er|ved him always in Health with an entire Freedom of Mind.</P>
<P>At &s;eventy Years of Age, a Coach in which he travelled was over|thrown, by which he was dragged a great Way, and wounded in his Head, one of his Legs and Arms. The Phy&s;icians de&s;paired of his Re|covery, and were for applying a great many Remedies to him. But <HI>Cornaro</HI> tells us, that being well &s;a|tisfied of the Temperature of his Humours, he rejected all the A&s;&s;i|&s;tances of the Phy&s;icians, and was quickly cured.</P>
<P>Nine Years after, when he was al|mo&s;t four&s;core, his Friends and his very Phy&s;icians advi&s;ed him to add two Ounces to his ordinary Diet. Within ten or twelve Days after, he fell &s;ick: the Phy&s;icians gave him
<PB N="112" REF="137">over, and he him&s;elf began to fear the wor&s;t, however he recovered his Health, tho' with much ado.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Author adds, that being four&s;core Years old, his Sight and Hearing was &s;ound and good; that his Voice held &s;trong; that he &s;ometimes &s;ung in Concert with his Grand-children; that he could either ride or walk a-foot very well, and that he compo&s;ed a Comedy which came off with Applau&s;e.</P>
<P>This wi&s;e, old Gentleman was then of the Opinion, that a regular and &s;mall Quantity of Food contributed more than any thing el&s;e to the pre|&s;ervation of Health; for he makes no Mention of his Choice of Diets. I am u&s;ed (&s;ays <HI>Cornaro</HI>) to take in all twelve Ounces of &s;olid Nouri&s;h|ment, &s;uch as Meat and the Yolk of an Egg, and fourteen Ounces of Drink. 'Tis to be lamented, that he did not preci&s;ely tell us, whether he took this Quantity at once, or twice a-day: However &s;ince he tells
<PB N="113" REF="138">us, that he did eat but a very little, it &s;eems as if he did &s;o but once a-day.</P>
<P>The famous Civilian, <HI>Panigarolus,</HI> who lived above &s;eventy Years, tho' of a very weak Con&s;titution, never eat or drank above twenty eight Ounces a-day, which comes al|mo&s;t to the &s;ame Quantity of <HI>Corna|ro</HI></P>
<P>I was intimately acquainted with one, who never took above thirty &s;ix Ounces a-day. 'Tis true indeed, that every fortnight he purged him|&s;elf, but he lived to above ninety Years of Age.</P>
<P>It &s;eems then as if <HI>Cornaro</HI> was minded to keep from us a perfect Knowledge of his Regimen, and only to tell us that he had found out an extraordinary one; &s;ince he has not informed us whether he took the Quantity he &s;peaks of at once, or twice a-day, nor whether he al|tered his Diet: for he treats on that
<PB N="114" REF="139">Subject as darkly and ob&s;curely as <HI>Hippocrates.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis likewi&s;e &s;trange, that the Quantity of his Liquid &s;hould ex|ceed that of his &s;olid Diet, and the rather, becau&s;e what he did eat was not equally nouri&s;hing, &s;ince he took Yolks of Eggs as well as Meat. In truth, to me he &s;eems to talk more like a Philo&s;opher than a Phy&s;ician.</P></Q>
<P>Thus far <HI>Cardan:</HI> But, by his leave, if he had read what <HI>Cornaro</HI> has writ|ten concerning a &s;ober and regular Life with Attention, he would have pa&s;&s;ed a &s;ounder Judgment on his Writings; for in them he not only &s;peaks of the Quantity, but in expre&s;s Terms di&s;|cour&s;es of the Quality of his Diet.</P>

<P>IT is not good to eat too much, or to fa&s;t too long, or do any thing el&s;e that is preternatural.</P>
<P>Whoever eats or drinks too much, will be &s;ick.</P>
<P>The Di&s;tempers of Repletion are cured by Ab&s;tinence.</P>
<P>Old Men can fa&s;t ea&s;ily; Men of ripe Age can fa&s;t almo&s;t as much; but young Per&s;ons and Children, that are bri&s;k and lively, can hardly fa&s;t at all.</P>
<P>Growing Per&s;ons have a great deal of natural Heat, which requires a great deal of Nouri&s;hment, el&s;e the Body will pine away: But old Men, who have but a little natural Heat, require

<P>It mu&s;t be examined what Sort of Per&s;ons ought to feed once or twice a-day, more or le&s;s; allowance being al|ways made to the Age of the Per&s;on, to the Sea&s;on of the Year, to the Place where one lives, and to Cu&s;tom.</P>
