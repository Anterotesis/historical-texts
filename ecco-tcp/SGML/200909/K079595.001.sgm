<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>IT may be nece&s;&s;ary in this age of &s;lander and detraction, for the writer of the following novel to declare, that, in the characters here drawn, he has pointed at no particular per&s;on, his view being merely to lay before the ri&s;ing generation, the arts and de|ceptions of the generality of
<PB N="vi" REF="3">mankind. He is very &s;en&s;ible that there are in all cla&s;&s;es of life, men of honour and re&s;|pectability; but it mu&s;t be al|lowed, at the &s;ame time, that there are not wanting men of the rever&s;e di&s;po&s;ition. It is a matter of lamentation that there are too many of them in the world, and by expo&s;ing them to the eye of the incautious, the author flatters him&s;elf, he is do|ing as laudable an act, as point|ing out to the unwary a pit art|fully concealed to entrap them.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="4">SOME readers may po&s;&s;ibly be acquainted with one anecdote, and &s;ome with another here told, they being facts of noto|riety; be that as it may, it they &s;erve to elucidate, or give a co|louring to the &s;ubject they are upon, there can be no more im|propriety in introducing them, than in repeating a good and well timed &s;tory in a large com|pany, becau&s;e &s;ome men in that company may have heard it be|fore.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<P>FROM an opinion that a reci|tal of my adventures through life may be u&s;eful to &s;ociety, I have been induced to give them to the world; and flatter my&s;elf that if they have not a tendency to make men philo&s;ophers, they, at lea&s;t, will teach them worldly knowledge,
<PB N="10" REF="7">and &s;hew them, that he is the rich|e&s;t and happie&s;t of mortals, who&s;e re&s;ources are within him&s;elf, and who depends lea&s;t upon the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of others.</P>
<P>WHO my parents were, is, in|deed, very immaterial, but it may be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay, that I am the only child of a very re&s;pectable, though not very opulent couple. My father's name was Wilbraham; he was de&s;cended from the younger branch of a good family; and though his e&s;tate in the county of Notting|ham did not exceed one hundred pounds a year, pride of blood pre|vented his putting me out to any
<PB N="11" REF="8">trade, but made him ambitious of bringing me up, as he called it, a <HI>Gentleman.</HI> One hundred a year was a &s;canty pittance to encourage &s;uch notions; but he lived, as half the world does, upon expectation; looked forward to the death of an uncle, mortgaged his little patri|mony to keep up appearances, and died, as the common phra&s;e is, &s;ome hundreds of pounds wor&s;e than no|thing. The only advantage I re|ceived from him was a tolerable e|ducation, acquired at a grammar-&s;chool in the neighbourhood. As he could not afford me a hor&s;e, nor any of tho&s;e rural indulgencies, which young gentlemen are taught
<PB N="12" REF="9">to expect, I was under the nece&s;&s;i|ty of &s;eeking my amu&s;ement at home, and I have ble&s;&s;ed my&s;elf &s;ince a thou&s;and times, in that ne|ce&s;&s;ity. Being fond of &s;tudy, I be|came ma&s;ter of the Cla&s;&s;icks, and the vicar of the pari&s;h, who profe&s;&s;|ed to have my intere&s;t much at heart, furni&s;hed me with the loan of &s;uch books, as he thought would improve my mind, and which our circulating library did not po&s;&s;e&s;s. By the time I was nineteen, I be|came, through the&s;e means, a tole|rable proficient in hi&s;tory, and the <HI>belles lettres,</HI> and was thought to be a pretty good &s;cholar; nor did I want the outward accompli&s;hments
<PB N="13" REF="10">of a gentleman. My father took care I &s;hould learn to dance, and the fencing-ma&s;ter who attended at the &s;chool where I was bred, find|ing me, as he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, an active, well-made young man, gave me, voluntarily, a &s;ufficient number of le&s;&s;ons on the &s;mall &s;word, to en|able me to defend my&s;elf, was I ever attacked in that way. This, added to a natural gaiety of temper, led me into the good graces of ma|ny; and had he left me his little e|&s;tate unincumbered, I &s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed through life without any dif|ficulty. As it is, few men have ex|perienced a greater vici&s;&s;itude of for|tune, or more embarra&s;&s;ments. My
<PB N="14" REF="11">father caught the &s;mall pox, and my mother, who loved him too tenderly to quit the hou&s;e, though &s;he had never had that di&s;order, im|prudently bu&s;ied her&s;elf about him, caught the infection, and I was thus deprived of both my parents at once; &s;he fell a &s;acrifice to the di&s;temper a few days after my fa|ther, and they were both buried in the &s;ame grave.</P>
<P>WITH the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of my good friend the vicar, I &s;oon looked round me, and found I had nothing to depend on but my&s;elf; the mort|gagees &s;eized the e&s;tate, which, ow|ing to the decrea&s;e in value of land,
<PB N="15" REF="12">was barely &s;ufficient to pay the mo|ney borrowed; and the ca&s;h into which his furniture, and other things were converted, was divided among his creditors, and did not pay more than twelve &s;hillings in the pound; &s;o that had not the vi|car felt for my &s;ituation, I &s;hould not have known how to have acted. Application was made to my fa|ther's uncle, but to no manner of purpo&s;e. His an&s;wer was, <Q>I had been brought up a <HI>Gentleman,</HI> and he &s;hould <HI>now</HI> &s;ee how I could make out upon the profe&s;&s;ion: he had never been con&s;ulted up|on my education, and was deter|mined not to give me a &s;hilling:
<PB N="16" REF="13">I might apply to my mother's relations, (who, by the by, were not in a &s;ituation to a&s;&s;i&s;t me) <HI>he</HI> de&s;ired never to hear any thing of me.</Q> In &s;hort, had it not been for the humanity of the vicar, who procured me a collection of fifty pounds among the neighbour|ing gentry, and who took me into his hou&s;e, till my father's affairs were adju&s;ted, I might have been turned out into the &s;treet a vagrant. To him I am indebted for the fir&s;t good office I experienced, and I am &s;ure it was di&s;intere&s;ted.&mdash;The God of Compa&s;&s;ion taught him mercy,&mdash; and he practi&s;ed it where he could.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="14">THE next &s;tep the vicar took, was to find a &s;ituation to place me in. He had a brother who kept a &s;chool in the neighbourhood of London, to him he applied, and prevailed on him to take me in as an a&s;&s;i&s;tant. Part of my money was expended in equiping me with ne|ce&s;&s;aries, and on the eve of my de|parture, which was &s;oon after, on counting my wealth, I found my|&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of three ten pound bank notes, and five pounds fifteen &s;hillings in ca&s;h; more money than I ever was ma&s;ter of, and of which I &s;imply thought, I never &s;hould &s;ee the end. My good friend advi&s;ed me to hu&s;band it to the utmo&s;t, and
<PB N="18" REF="15">with this view I took a place to London on the roof of the coach; but that no future &s;ituation of mine might hurt the pride of my father's family, I changed my name, and called, my&s;elf, <HI>Gabriel Outca&s;t.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t day's journey pa&s;&s;ed to|lerably well. It was fine wea|ther, and I had a companion on the roof, an itinerant pedlar. The pa&s;|&s;engers within were, a footman and two maid &s;ervants of a Nottingham|&s;hire Baronet, an outrider to a trade&s;|man in London, and a &s;muggler; &s;o that in point of company, I thought
<PB N="20" REF="17">my&s;elf as happy without, as I &s;hould have been within. The only know|ledge I could gather from the ped|lar, was &s;ome part of the my&s;teries of his profe&s;&s;ion: he took a great deal of pains to per&s;uade me he was a ra&s;cal; &s;uch as that, under a tra|velling licence, and the idea of &s;el|ling things cheap, the articles he dealt in were of the wor&s;t kind, and generally damaged, for which he got the be&s;t price, and very often &s;old goods to the ignorant and un|wary thirty per cent. dearer than they could be bought for of the fair dealer. However, I had nothing to do with him; as I did not &s;et up for a corrector of other men's con|duct,
<PB N="21" REF="18">I left him in the enjoyment of his iniquity, and we pa&s;&s;ed through the day as &s;ociable as beg|gars generally are; for I determined on my fir&s;t out&s;et, to bring my mind, if po&s;&s;ible, to a conformity with the humility of any &s;ituation I might be thrown into. But, not|with&s;tanding my philo&s;ophy, I found my&s;elf rather hurt at the clo&s;e of the day. Though riding on the roof of the coach, I con&s;idered my&s;elf, from family, from education, from pro|perty, much &s;uperior to tho&s;e with|in; but <HI>my</HI> thinking &s;o did not lead the landlord of the inn where we were to &s;leep, and his wife, to think the &s;ame. I found a manife&s;t
<PB N="22" REF="19">difference between riding <HI>without,</HI> and riding <HI>within.</HI> The pedlar, ac|cu&s;tomed to &s;uch travelling, took his place, in&s;tantly on alighting, in the corner of the kitchen chimney; but on my engaging the attention of the chambermaid, to whom I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf very civilly, &s;he was &s;oon routed by her mi&s;tre&s;s, with a <Q>I wi&s;h to God, Betty, you'd leave that fellow, and attend to the in|&s;ide pa&s;&s;engers.</Q> It was in vain for me to plead a head-ache, and a wi&s;h to be &s;hewn to my chamber. She told me, that &s;he had no beds but for the gentlemen and ladies that came in the coach, and that I mu&s;t turn into the loft or the &s;table.
<PB N="23" REF="20">In vain did Betty argue in my fa|vour, in vain did &s;he &s;ay, that I and the <HI>gentleman</HI> in the chimney-corner, meaning the pedlar, might lay to|gether in the &s;pare garret; nothing would do, till I pulled out my pur&s;e, and a&s;ked her to change me a ten pound note: for one of the notes I had lodged in my pur&s;e, the others were &s;afe &s;towed in my trunk. The naming of a ten pound note altered her tone, &s;he <Q>begged my pardon for not being able to attend to me in the hurry &s;he was in; but that if I could di&s;pen&s;e with lay|ing at the top of the hou&s;e with my fellow-traveller, the bed was a good one, and it &s;hould be clean
<PB N="24" REF="21">&s;heeted.</Q> I was too fatigued, and too much &s;haken with my jour|ney, to be very nice about my lodging; I could have &s;lept upon the boards. I told her, <Q>I would get &s;omething warm to drink, &s;ettle the matter with my fellow-traveller, and when the chamber|maid had waited on the coach <HI>gentry,</HI> I would be &s;hewn to my room.</Q> Finding the benefit I de|rived from the naming a bank note, I began again to di&s;play my wealth, in order to get con&s;equence at the fire-&s;ide,&mdash;and I di&s;covered, that it not only procured me the warme&s;t place, but the attention of the whole kitchen. A butcher in the further
<PB N="25" REF="22">corner ob&s;erved to me, that <Q>he had known <HI>gem'men</HI> ride upon the roof of the coach through choice, for his part he never rode any where el&s;e; it was plea&s;anter, and he could <HI>nater</HI> the country.</Q> In &s;hort, after a few ceremonies a|bout place were adju&s;ted, and a few coals laid on, we pre&s;ently became acquainted, and the &s;tate of the na|tion was debated on. The butcher &s;aid, <Q>the mini&s;ter was a man of his own <HI>kidney,</HI> that he handled a <HI>knife</HI> well, and got to the bot|tom of a <HI>wound</HI> at once; did not &s;tand niggling as &s;ome of our &s;tate&s;men do, but when he <HI>cut,</HI> cut at a &s;ingle &s;troke, and chopped
<PB N="26" REF="23">off every unnece&s;&s;ary part of the con&s;titution at a blow:</Q> <Q>Yes, yes,</Q> &s;ays an exci&s;eman, who &s;at oppo&s;ite to him, <Q>he <HI>does</HI> cut, with a vengeance; I am &s;ure I have rea&s;on to &s;ay &s;o, for he has cut <HI>me</HI> out of a vote for the county, and now, in all proba|bility, I may lo&s;e my place.</Q> <Q>And no harm,</Q> replies the but|cher, <Q>if you was. D&mdash; me, it would be happy for this country if there wasn't an exci&s;eman in it. We &s;hould then have our beer at half price,</Q> "Yes, by G-d," re|turns the exci&s;eman, <Q>rogues would be then triumphant.</Q> Finding the conver&s;ation grow warm, I con|&s;ulted
<PB N="27" REF="24">the pedlar, and we retired to our chamber; we paid our reckon|ing, however, fir&s;t; for the land|lady told us, it was cu&s;tomary for all out&s;ide pa&s;&s;engers to pay for their beds before they &s;lept in them, as it &s;aved a world of trouble in the morning; and it was lucky for me that this cu&s;tom was complied with; for my di&s;play of my money at the fire-&s;ide had &s;o fa&s;cinated the atten|tion of the pedlar, that he thought proper to ri&s;e an hour before the coach &s;et off, and make free with my pur&s;e and its contents, which laid in my breeches pocket, on the chair be&s;ide me; but which from the &s;ound &s;leep I was in, I was in&s;en&s;i|ble
<PB N="28" REF="25">of his taking. All I know is, that having paid my reckoning the night before, I had no occa&s;ion for money in the morning, and never mi&s;&s;ed it, till I wanted to pay for my breakfa&s;t; and that the pedlar had taken it was beyond a doubt, as he was &s;een to leave the inn with his wallet before the coachman was vi|&s;ible, and had not, though he had taken his place for London, paid any part of his fare. As we are apt to make the be&s;t of misfortunes, like the philo&s;opher, who having broke his leg, rejoiced that it was not his neck, I con&s;oled my&s;elf in not having lo&s;t my trunk, that hav|ing been commited to the care of
<PB N="29" REF="26">the coachman, in which the remain|der of my money was &s;towed, and of which I determined to be more careful.</P>
<P>WE had now no one on the out|&s;ide but the coachman and my&s;elf whom I addre&s;&s;ed in his own way, and whom a gla&s;s of brandy or gin at every village where he &s;topped, had made very eloquent and com|municative. <Q>This will be a d-mned poor journey for me,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>nobody without, and none but beggars within!</Q>&mdash;for I found his attention was always engro&s;&s;ed with what he &s;hould get upon the road. I a&s;ked him, if he
<PB N="30" REF="27">was not paid by his ma&s;ter? <Q>Yes, by G-d,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>after a man|ner,&mdash;twelve &s;hillings a week,&mdash; which will &s;carce find me in gin and tobacco. If it was not now and then for a generous pa&s;&s;en|ger, we coachmen might &s;tarve. 'Tis true we get a &s;hilling or two occa&s;ionally, by a &s;hort pa&s;&s;en|ger, or for the carriage of a par|cel that is not booked, but that's a poor pittance in the&s;e hard times.</Q> On my ob&s;erving to him, that the&s;e occa&s;ional &s;hillings were, in my opinion, the property of his ma&s;ter: "Are they by G-d?" &s;ays he, <Q>then the devil may drive his coach for me.&mdash;No, no
<PB N="31" REF="28">ma&s;ter, we don't &s;tand all wea|thers, late and early, for twelve &s;hillings a week; I have known coachmen get three guineas, and richly de&s;erve it too.</Q>&mdash;<Q>But not hone&s;tly?</Q>&mdash;<Q>Yes, hone&s;tly. My coach carries four, and if I now and then pick up a fifth up|on the road, how is he the wor&s;e for it?</Q> In &s;hort, as it is in vain to di&s;pute with a man again&s;t his intere&s;t, I dropped the argument, and contented my&s;elf with general topics, till we arrived at the inn, where we were to breakfa&s;t, and where I fir&s;t di&s;covered the friendli|ne&s;s of my la&s;t night's bed-fellow, who, finding me embarra&s;&s;ed, as he
<PB N="32" REF="29">thought, with too much money, was kind enough to ea&s;e me of part of it. However, as I knew not his name, and he was a &s;tranger to the hou&s;e where we lodged, I could do no otherwi&s;e than reconcile my&s;elf to the lo&s;s, have recour&s;e to my trunk, and &s;upply my pocket afre&s;h. Nothing of any con&s;equence happen|ed the remainder of the day; I was &s;et down at Highgate, five miles &s;hort of London, where the vicar's brother re&s;ided; and as I tipped the coachman a &s;hilling, I had his ble&s;&s;ing at parting; &s;o ea&s;y is it to procure the good wi&s;hes of the&s;e blades of the whip!</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P>DR. SLASHEM, the vicar's brother in law, to whom I was recommended, received me at his door with apparent civility, but &s;oon gave me to under&s;tand that he had reckoned without his ho&s;t, when he propo&s;ed taking an a&s;&s;i&s;tant. His &s;chool was but of late e&s;tabli&s;hment, two &s;cholars had le&s;t him the day
<PB N="34" REF="31">before, and he had no greater num|ber than he could attend to him&s;elf; however, out of re&s;pect to his bro|ther, he would contrive to give me hou&s;e-room, till I could find a &s;itu|ation to my liking, and as he under|&s;tood I was not able to afford great things, provided I would occa&s;ion|ally a&s;&s;i&s;t him in &s;chool hours, I &s;hould not pay for my lodging and board more than fifteen &s;hillings a week.&mdash;I was not &s;o young but I could &s;ee the drift of this gentle|man's civility; in&s;tead of paying me for my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as I expected, I was to pay for my board and lodg|ing, and give him my labour gratis; however, being a &s;tranger in that
<PB N="35" REF="32">part of the world, and not knowing where to go, I di&s;&s;embled in my turn, told him how much I thought my&s;elf obliged to him, and accept|ed his <HI>friendly</HI> offer. He introduced me to his family, which con&s;i&s;ted of a wife, a daughter about &s;even|teen, rather pretty than otherwi&s;e, and ten boys between the ages of nine and fourteen. Mrs. Sla&s;hem was &s;ome years younger than the Doctor, and &s;eemed to look upon her daughter with a jealous eye, and as one who told her &s;he was growing in years. Mi&s;s, in her turn, was of a forward ca&s;t, and thought &s;he had more right to be noticed than her mother, who was
<PB N="36" REF="33">a married woman, and in her time had had her &s;hare of admirers: in &s;hort, I no &s;ooner entered, than I di&s;covered that both had &s;hot their arrows at me at once. "Biddy," &s;ays Mrs. Sla&s;hem, <Q>I wi&s;h you'd get down &s;tairs, you &s;tare at the young man as if you never &s;aw a young man before.</Q> <Q>Ah, get down, you young baggage,</Q> &s;ays the doctor, <Q>and get us &s;ome|thing nice for &s;upper.</Q> Mi&s;s &s;lammed the door after her, but not without giving me to under&s;tand by her looks, that &s;he was angry at being &s;ent out of the room. Mrs. Sla&s;hem, primming up her mouth, and adju&s;ting her features into an
<PB N="37" REF="34">affected form of re&s;erved politene&s;s, <Q>hoped I would excu&s;e the awk|wardne&s;s of her girl, who had &s;een but little of the world, and had rather out-grown her age; for though in &s;ize &s;he re&s;embled a woman, &s;he was, in fact, little more than a child.</Q> <Q>Indeed, my dear,</Q> replies the Doctor, <Q>you wrong the girl, for you was married at her age.</Q> <Q>If I was,</Q> retorts the wife angrily, and bridling up, <Q>I hope I had more di&s;cretion, and more of the woman in me.</Q> "Di&s;cretion," returns the Doctor, <Q>I will &s;ay nothing about, but as to the <HI>wo|man,</HI> I will admit that you had
<PB N="38" REF="35">always enough of that;</Q> giving me a wink with his left eye. <Q>But come, the young man, I dare &s;ay, will be glad of a little refre&s;h|ment, if you will be kind enough to provide it.</Q> For, as we had come a long day's journey, I began to wi&s;h for &s;upper, though it was but eight o'clock. Mrs. Sla&s;hem retired to provide for our repa&s;t, and get the boys to bed, and of cour&s;e left me and the Doctor together. He then gave me a long detail of the difficulties he had met with in e&s;tabli&s;hing his &s;chool. I told him, <Q>that no doubt his character had recommended him, and that as he came to be better known, his
<PB N="39" REF="36">number of &s;cholars would in|crea&s;e.</Q> <Q>Character, my good friend,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>is the lea&s;t recommendation; parents, now-a-days, will put their children out where they have the mo&s;t taught for the lea&s;t money. In order to get a good price, &s;choolma&s;ters are reduced to artifice.</Q> <Q>Good God!&mdash;Artifice;</Q> exclaimed I, <Q>can artifice avail where children &s;hould be kept &s;trangers to de|ceit?</Q> <Q>You mi&s;under&s;tand me, Sir,</Q> replies the Doctor, <Q>I mean artifice in the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of a &s;chool. I'll explain it to you, it may be of u&s;e to you in life, if you propo&s;e to follow
<PB N="40" REF="37">the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion.&mdash;Parents have an idea, that the fewer &s;cholars a man has, the better he can attend to them, and then, of cour&s;e, he can demand a better price. A man taking only four boys, may expect fifty pounds a year for each, whereas if he takes fourteen, he will find it difficult to get more than twenty. After a man has got one or two to be|gin with, that he may not be &s;uppo&s;ed to want &s;cholars, he gives out, that he will take no greater number than four,&mdash;then, he has room for two more:&mdash;he procures them:&mdash;he then finds he can attend to ten, to which num|ber
<PB N="41" REF="38">he will confine him&s;elf; but that is only till he can get an|other ten; &s;o that he never &s;tops till in fact he can <HI>get</HI> no more.</Q> In &s;hort, he gave me to under&s;tand, that by &s;uch means, and by a little extra attention and tenderne&s;s to tho&s;e boys as were the children of wealthy parents, who have it fre|quently in their power to recom|mend others, it is, that men e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;chool &s;ooner than by any other method. Indeed, I found it was his invariable practice to wink at the faults of the boys of opulent, parents, and keep up the &s;tricte&s;t di&s;cipline with others it being ne|ce&s;&s;ary to puni&s;h &s;ome as an exam|ple
<PB N="42" REF="39">to the re&s;t: when a poor man's &s;on, charged, perhaps, with robbing the garden, has endeavoured to ex|culpate him&s;elf, by di&s;covering the offender, and laying the blame, ju&s;tly, on his more wealthy, but guilty &s;choolmate, I have known the Doctor exclaim, <Q>It is a bare|faced lie,&mdash;Ma&s;ter Goldwire is the &s;on of a <HI>gentleman,</HI> and above a ba&s;e act, and I'll puni&s;h you for the fal&s;e a&s;&s;ertion.</Q>&mdash;Then, as to the annual price of &s;chooling; twenty pounds a year, the Doctor told me, (which, indeed, was the price he had with <HI>his</HI> &s;cholars) was but &s;mall pay; however, what with the profits derived from &s;elling the
<PB N="43" REF="40">children toys, fruit, pens, paper, and other articles, at two hundred per cent. gain, getting from each boy half a guinea or a guinea at Chri&s;tmas, under the idea of pre&s;ents to the &s;ervants, taking their pocket money on their return from the holidays, under a pretence of keeping it for them, and giving them only part of it again; charg|ing in their bills occa&s;ionally a pair of &s;hoes, a copy-book, and the like, more than they have had; by &s;uch &s;undry emoluments he made out pretty well. And on my &s;eeming to di&s;approve of &s;uch conduct by my looks, he told me, there was no doing otherwi&s;e. It was the annual
<PB N="44" REF="41">price of board and &s;chooling to which parents chiefly attended. To be a&s;ked thirty pounds a year would frighten them, but under a notion of paying but twenty, the con&s;ider|ations he had mentioned, would draw and additional twenty from them without a murmur: then &s;ays he again, we can get a guinea a quarter for dancing, as much for drawing, and fifteen &s;hillings, per|haps, for writing, when in fact we pay to the different ma&s;ters only half the price we charge. If it was not for the&s;e arts and contrivances, a &s;chool ma&s;ter had better be a hackney coachman, and drive mules rather than boys. In &s;hort, I found from
<PB N="45" REF="42">the doctrine of the pedlar, the &s;tage-coachman, and this <HI>worthy</HI> friend of mine, that to live in the world a man mu&s;t not be <HI>too</HI> hone&s;t. On the &s;ame plan of rea&s;oning, the doc|tor would have kept me for his a&s;|&s;i&s;tant; for he expected as much of me, as if he had paid me a &s;alary of thirty pounds a year. I was de|termined, however, to get from this place as &s;oon as I could; for my re|maining &s;tock would not admit of my paying fifteen &s;hillings a week for my board. I had been now a fortnight in the family before I thought of removing, and to do ju&s;tice to Mrs. Sla&s;hem and her daughter, they did every thing in
<PB N="46" REF="43">their power to make my time pa&s;s agreeably. The mother, in order to have my company abroad, would frequently de&s;ire the Doctor to &s;pare me, as it was proper where &s;he was going to have an e&s;cort, and mi&s;s would frequently &s;teal up into my room when I was alone, play about me, and entertain me with the &s;e|cret anecdotes of the family; from her I learned that her papa was no doctor, but had a&s;&s;umed the title in order to give credit to the &s;chool; that her mama had con&s;tantly a gentleman came to &s;ee her at &s;chool hours, when her papa was at the top of the hou&s;e with the boys: in &s;hort, &s;he told me how much her
<PB N="47" REF="44">mama hated her papa, and how much &s;he dete&s;ted them both, and that &s;he would give the world if any one would take her out of the hou&s;e; that &s;he did not care where &s;he went, if &s;he was but from home; that her mama treated her as a girl, when &s;he knew &s;he was as much a woman as her&s;elf, and that &s;he was going in eighteen, and was deter|mined not to be a great while long|er in leading &s;trings. The a&s;&s;idu|ous attention of the mother would perhaps have been far from di&s;agree|able to me, if mi&s;s had been out of my reach; but Mrs. Sla&s;hem had in&s;i&s;ted, a day or two after my arriv|al, that I &s;hould be made free of
<PB N="48" REF="45">the village we lived in, according to the ancient ceremonial of the place; which was, to be &s;worn up|on the horns, not to eat brown bread if I could get white, unle&s;s I liked brown better; not to put up with the maid when I could h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e the mi&s;tre&s;s, unle&s;s I liked the maid better, and &s;o on: and as oaths are not merely confined to the <HI>letter,</HI> but extend to the <HI>&s;pirit</HI> of them, I conceived I was equally &s;worn not to put up with the mother, if I could have the daughter, unle&s;s I liked the mother better. Indeed, &s;uch was the favour I was in with both, that I was &s;carcely left to my choice, and a dread of the chapter
<PB N="49" REF="46">of accidents, was one principal mo|tive for my wi&s;hing my&s;elf away. The cen&s;orious reader may perhaps &s;uppo&s;e, that, as a young man bor|dering upon twenty, I was no an|chorite, and that I was not &s;uffici|ent ma&s;ter of philo&s;ophy, to with|&s;tand a temptation thrown indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly in my way; in &s;hort, he may &s;uppo&s;e&mdash;what he will,&mdash;and as I profe&s;s my&s;elf a member of the reformed church, and the nece&s;&s;ity of auricular confe&s;&s;ion to be no part of my faith, I &s;hall take the liberty to leave him to his conjectures, and only &s;ay, that for more rea&s;ons than one, I wi&s;hed my&s;elf in any &s;itua|tion but where I was. I had an
<PB N="50" REF="47">opportunity of &s;eeing the new&s;pa|pers, and I looked carefully to the adverti&s;ements, hoping to meet with &s;omething that might &s;uit me. My circum&s;tances would not admit of my being very nice in my choice, for though I had near nineteen pounds in my pocket on my arri|val at Highgate, after I had paid the coachman and the expences of the la&s;t day's journey; that nineteen, from a triffling pre&s;ent or two to Mi&s;s, a few out-door treats to her mother in our afternoon walks, and what I &s;hould have to pay for my board and wa&s;hing, go as &s;oon as I would, would be reduced to little more than ten pounds. This, and a wi&s;h for
<PB N="51" REF="48">an ea&s;y place, determined me, if I could not do better, even to put on a livery, rather than run my&s;elf in|to difficulties, and to wait for a turn of fortune to befriend me. I did not communicate my de&s;ign to the family, as circum&s;tances had made it nece&s;&s;ary to conceal my&s;elf from them, but told them I had a friend in London who promi&s;ed to look out for a &s;ituation to place me in; and under a pretence of going to this friend, I had an opportunity of applying, as many adverti&s;ements directed me. To a <Q>Wanted a &s;mart young man to attend in the &s;hop of an apothecary,</Q> I applied, and found it was to open
<PB N="52" REF="49">and &s;weep the &s;hop, pound in the mortar, carry out medicines, and apply gli&s;ters; this would not do; it was a <HI>laborious</HI> employ, and to labour I had not been accu&s;tomed. The next adverti&s;ement that &s;truck me was, <Q>Wanted a man of good figure, in an ea&s;y genteel office, with good encouragement:</Q> here I enquired, and found there had been a variety of applicants, mo&s;t men wi&s;hing for ea&s;y places and good pay. This was no other than to &s;tand all day at the door of one of tho&s;e auctioneers, who are con&s;tant|ly &s;elling things made up purpo&s;e|ly to take in the ignorant and incautious, and with a vociferous
<PB N="53" REF="50">voice to call out to every per&s;on that pa&s;&s;es, <Q>Walk in, Sir, walk in gentlemen&mdash;&s;elling by auction.</Q> The abilities for this office were lit|tle more than a good pair of lungs, and the pay was two &s;hillings a day; as the &s;ituation, however, was by no means a concealed one, I readily de|clined it. The next was more like|ly to an&s;wer my purpo&s;e: <Q>Want|ed a per&s;on of good addre&s;s and gentleman-like appearance, to at|tend a few hours a day in a re&s;|pectable employ, for which a good &s;alary would be given.</Q> The read|er will naturally &s;ay, I had no &s;mall &s;hare of vanity, to attend only to &s;uch adverti&s;ements as required <HI>&s;martne&s;s,
<PB N="54" REF="51">good-figure, addre&s;s,</HI> and <HI>gentleman|like</HI> appearance; but when he is told that both Mrs. Sla&s;hem and Mi&s;s had con&s;tantly given me to under|&s;tand, that I was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of tho&s;e qualities, he will not wonder at my believing it. This adverti&s;ement &s;ucceeded; it was not to &s;tand at the door of one of the&s;e auctions, but to act as a decoy during the time of &s;elling, and lead per&s;ons on to bid their money. I was to attend from eleven to three in the week days, and my pay was to be eighteen &s;hil|lings a week. I accepted the place and was to be initiated into my of|fice the week following. Accord|ingly, I took a lodging in the neigh|bourhood,
<PB N="55" REF="52">a two pair of &s;tairs room in the &s;hop of a trade&s;man, for which I was to pay &s;ix &s;hillings a week, and I was determined to make the remaining twelve an&s;wer every other purpo&s;e. Happy in this engagement, I acquainted the Doc|tor, that I &s;hould now be no longer trouble&s;ome to him, that I was go|ing to America in a merchan'ts fa|mily, as tutor to his &s;on, a lad of twelve years of age, for which I was to have a hand&s;ome &s;alary. Though I had not been &s;ix weeks with the Doctor, I found it difficult to get away. He had conceived an <HI>affection</HI> for me, and rather than part with me, would take half a
<PB N="56" REF="53">guinea a week. Mrs. Sla&s;hem u&s;ed all her rhetoric to per&s;uade me to continue, and Mi&s;s Sla&s;hem all her charms; but nothing would do. I had my private rea&s;ons for leaving them, and on my promi&s;e to cor|re&s;pond with Mi&s;s, as occa&s;ion &s;hould offer, I was &s;uffered to depart in peace. I had been brought up with proper notions of right and wrong, and could &s;carce reconcile this de|ception to my way of thinking, but when I con&s;idered the plea of nece&s;|&s;ity, and that &s;elf-pre&s;ervation was the fir&s;t law of nature, I was ea&s;ily led to ju&s;tify the proceeding. I was ma&s;ter of my own actions, and had not by a promi&s;e, made to any of
<PB N="57" REF="54">the parties, forfeited a right of di&s;|po&s;ing of my&s;elf as I thought pro|per.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>MY new employer was not a little plea&s;ed with my fi|gure, he could only have wi&s;hed I was a few years older;&mdash;that was ea&s;ily remedied by my mode of dre&s;s, and we contrived it between us, that I wore the appearance of forty. As the office I was to enter on required a few in&s;tructions, the following
<PB N="59" REF="56">were the chief maxims he gave me: <Q>Always to watch <HI>his</HI> eyes, and when he looked full in my face, bid &s;omething more than the la&s;t bidder.</Q> <Q>Never to &s;ee a flaw, or an imperfection in any thing &s;elling.</Q> <Q>And to find out beauties, if po&s;&s;ible, even where there are none.</Q> <Q>To pretend to know the value of every thing, and a&s;|&s;ert in a confidential manner to bidders, that the article &s;elling was worth double the money bid for it.</Q> The&s;e were the in&s;truc|tions I was to follow, and I recon|ciled them to my&s;elf under the fol|lowing rea&s;oning: that bidders at an auction buy upon their own judg|ment,
<PB N="60" REF="57">and if they buy too dear, it is their own faults; that auctioneers are forbidden to bid them&s;elves, and that, of cour&s;e, if they had not &s;ome friend to bid for them occa&s;ionally, articles at times would not fetch half their value; that deception runs through trade in general, no trade&s;man being condemnable for not pointing out the imperfections of his goods. As to any other arti|fices made u&s;e of in the profe&s;&s;ion, I was to have no concern with. The auctioneer, as things were not &s;old by a catalogue, was at liberty to of|fer any article for &s;ale that he plea&s;|ed; &s;o that if a countryman came in, we were &s;ure to have a &s;ilver
<PB N="61" REF="58">watch put up; or if a lady, &s;ome pieces of china, or a &s;et of &s;ilver-handled knives and forks, and &s;o on; the one; I would whi&s;per was old china, and the other, had <HI>town-made</HI> blades with the handles of <HI>&s;o|lid</HI> &s;ilver, and no lie neither. In &s;hort, I di&s;charged my duty &s;o well as to give my employer &s;atisfaction, and often procured him a better price for his goods than the fir&s;t co&s;t. Our plan was not a lit|tle forwarded by the <HI>touter</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Touter</HI> is a nickname given to tho&s;e who &s;tand a &s;hop-doors, and entice in cu&s;to|mers, as butchers that cry out, <HI>What do you buy, Sir?</HI> Old cloaths men in Monmouth-&s;treet, &amp;c. <HI>See, what you want, Sir;</HI> and men at auctions, <HI>Walk in gentlemen, Selling by auc|tion, &amp;c.</HI></NOTE> at the door, calling out, <Q>Selling by auc|tion
<PB N="62" REF="59">under a judgment.</Q> <Q>Mu&s;t be &s;old, Gentlemen, without re|&s;erve, to relea&s;e a man from pri|&s;on,</Q> &amp;c. It is unknown the numbers &s;uch declarations draw in to buy, under an idea of getting things at half their value; and if they are taken in, by the law of retaliation, they richly de&s;erve it. Sometimes our &s;ale, indeed, has been interrupted by a per&s;on contra|dicting the auctioneer flatly, and de|claring aloud, that the article was not what he repre&s;ented it; in this ca&s;e, I was immediately directed to
<PB N="63" REF="60">bid, and I became the buyer. This done, the company are di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with, <Q>Gentlemen, I am much o|bliged to you, we have done &s;el|ling for to-day.</Q> The company of cour&s;e withdraw, the obnoxious per&s;on gone, the &s;treet door is &s;hut for five minutes, and then re-opened with a <Q>Walk in, Gentlemen, &s;el|ling by auction,</Q> and the room is pre&s;ently filled again with fre&s;h com|pany; for the&s;e &s;ales are always held in &s;ome very public thoroughfare.</P>
<P>INDEED, there is &s;carce an auc|tion of any denomination, without its impo&s;itions. In &s;ales of linen and other drapery goods, they will
<PB N="64" REF="61">put &s;even or eight yards of &s;ilk, worth about &s;ix &s;hillings a yard, into the &s;ame lot with a roll of cour&s;e dowlas worth &s;even-pence, and &s;ell the two together at &s;o much per yard. If you a&s;k how many yards in the roll, they will tell you about thirty; you make your calculation accordingly, and perhaps buy the whole at one &s;hil|ling and &s;ix-pence a yard, thinking thus to give about two pounds five &s;hillings for the lot, which, at &s;ix-pence per yard for the dowlas, would give you the &s;ilk for four &s;hillings; but after having paid down the earne&s;t, and the lot is to be deliver|ed, the roll of linen &s;hall contain
<PB N="65" REF="62">&s;ixty yards in&s;tead of thirty, in which ca&s;e you pay eight &s;hillings and &s;ix-pence a yard for the &s;ilk, and are encumbered with more dow|las than you know what to do with. So again in auctions of furniture: the auctioneer, in order to have his &s;ales well attended, finds it nece&s;|&s;ary, not only to treat the brokers with a dinner, but to give each of them a lot at their own price, &s;o that at auctions in and near Lon|don, where there are plenty of bro|kers, if twenty are pre&s;ent, you are &s;ure to have twenty lots (and per|haps the be&s;t of your furniture) given away. The brokers, on the other hand, have their arts of im|po&s;ing,
<PB N="66" REF="63">if you appoint one to pur|cha&s;e certain lots for you at certain prices, under an idea, that the will buy them cheaper, you are &s;ure to be charged pretty near the price you fix|ed, though perhaps they purcha&s;ed them for half the money.</P>
<P>I WAS in this employ upwards of two months, when an accident hap|pened that lo&s;t me my place. Dur|ing the &s;elling of a plated cruet-&s;tand, worth about thirty &s;hillings, who &s;hould come in but Dr. Sla&s;h|em? As I was di&s;gui&s;ed, he could not po&s;&s;ibly know me, except I had opened my mouth, which I took care not to do. He bid a guinea
<PB N="67" REF="64">and a half for it; which my ma&s;ter did not think enough; I was called upon by his looks to bid again&s;t him; I did it by a nod, but as the Doctor did not &s;ee it, he a&s;&s;erted he was the la&s;t bidder, the auctioneer appealed to me, but I was mute as a fi&s;h, and Sla&s;hem was the buyer; the company were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and I was immediately di&s;charged. But his anger did not cea&s;e here, whil&s;t in his &s;ervice, I had &s;old my own watch, and bought rather a better, and had al&s;o purcha&s;ed a pair of pi&s;tols: the watch, which was a metal one, had been brought to him, reque&s;ting him to &s;ell it, which he refu&s;ed, I therefore pur|cha&s;ed
<PB N="68" REF="65">it for fifty &s;hillings, and &s;old my own for pretty nearly the &s;ame &s;um. This watch was a &s;tolen one, and was adverti&s;ed, and my quondam ma&s;ter, the auctioneer, carried his re|&s;entment &s;o far, as to lay an informa|tion before a magi&s;trate, that he had &s;een &s;uch a watch in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: a warrant was accordingly i&s;&s;ued, and one evening, about ten o'clock, as I was going to bed at my lodging, I heard a great noi&s;e below, and a fel|low with a hoar&s;e voice inquiring for one Gabriel Outca&s;t. Con&s;cious of having done no wrong, I went down &s;tairs, and was immediately taken into cu&s;tody, charged with a high|way robbery. All I could &s;ay had
<PB N="69" REF="66">but little effect. The warrant was to be executed, the watch was taken out of my pocket, my room was &s;earched and the pi&s;tols, which lay upon my table, &s;eized. The little money I was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of I put in|to my pocket, and I was thence hurried to the pari&s;h round-hou&s;e, where, under lock and key, I pa&s;&s;ed a very unea&s;y night. The next morning I was taken before a trad|ing magi&s;trate, and charged with robbing a man in the Five Fields Chel&s;ea of his watch, the Friday evening before, and though I pro|te&s;ted my innocence in the &s;trong|e&s;t terms, and made out a very good &s;tory, yet, being confronted with the
<PB N="70" REF="67">pro&s;ecutor, who &s;wore to his pro|perty, and the identical watch being found upon me, and the pi&s;tols in my room; circum&s;tances were too much again&s;t me to get off: the only thing in my favour was, that the pro&s;ecutor could not &s;wear to my per&s;on, as I appeared to be a younger man than the one who robbed him; for I was not now in my auction dre&s;s; but then, on the other hand, the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, where I lodged, depo&s;ing, that I went abroad every day in a di&s;gui&s;e, which gave me the appearance of an elderly man, corroborated the &s;u&s;|picion. I had &s;ent to the auctioneer, who could prove that the watch had
<PB N="71" REF="68">been offered to him for &s;ale, and who&s;e evidence would, of cour&s;e, have operated in my favour; but he was indu&s;triou&s;ly out of the way, and as I could not procure bail, I was committed to Bridewell till the next week, when I was to be brought before the ju&s;tice again.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of my examination, his wor&s;hip bawled out, <Q>hand over that there watch,</Q> which on looking at, he put into his pocket with a <Q>this mu&s;t be produced up|on the trial.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Con&s;table, &s;ee what money the pri&s;oner has a|bout him.</Q> I had two guineas and a few &s;hillings in my pocket,
<PB N="72" REF="69">which he directed to be handed over likewi&s;e, and on the pro&s;ecutor's &s;aying he had lo&s;t &s;ome gold, but could not &s;wear to the money.&mdash; "I don't know how you &s;hould," replies the ju&s;tice, <Q>one guinea is too like another for that; it looks however, like money di&s;|hone&s;tly come by, and &s;o&mdash;</Q> put|ting it into his pocket <Q>it &s;hall go with the watch</Q> I <Q>humbly conceive,</Q> &s;aid I, addre&s;&s;ing my|&s;elf to him, <Q>that as the money is not &s;worn to, it ought to be re|turned me.</Q> <Q>Stop that fel|low's mouth,</Q> roared out his wor&s;hip, <Q>and give me his mitti|mus to &s;ign,</Q> and in an accent
<PB N="73" REF="70">lower, "damn your humble con|ceptions!" &mdash;I deemed it fortunate that I had &s;ecreted a ten pound note, all the money I had left, in my fob; where the&s;e gra&s;ping fangs of the law, had no idea of looking.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t I was in pri&s;on, I met with a man who had been confined forty &s;even years. He was &s;hut up on execution, at the &s;uit of the crown, for a heavy fine impo&s;ed on him, for having in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;ome exci&s;eable goods that had not paid the duty; of cour&s;e no in&s;ol|vent act could di&s;charge him. This man, bating his imprudence that brought him there, was not with|out
<PB N="74" REF="71">his virtues. He was the oracle and chaplain of the jail; and being a man of good &s;en&s;e, was often a real comfort and a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the unhappy. He had outlived all his friends and connections, and had nothing to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on, but the allowance of the pri&s;on, the &s;canty &s;parings of his fellow-pri|&s;oners, almo&s;t as poor and wretched as him&s;elf, and the benevolence of a few out-door neighbours, who oc|ca&s;ionally &s;ent him a dinner, or an old coat to cover him: &s;tockings he wore none, and perhaps, the only u&s;ele&s;s part of his dre&s;s, was a wool|len night cap that covered his bald head, being grown grey within the
<PB N="75" REF="72">walls. The little hair he had was wiry; for affliction, when it does not kill, proceeds to harden. Though covered with the ru&s;t of a jail and offen&s;ive through want of cleanli|ne&s;s, this old man approached me in &s;o mode&s;t and decent a manner, that I could not but be plea&s;ed with him. He had acquired a degree of philo&s;ophy &s;ince his confinement, (for what patience will not a pri&s;on teach?) and &s;eemed &s;o reconciled to his &s;ituation, as not to wi&s;h for li|berty. <Q>To be abroad again in the world,</Q> he &s;aid, <Q>to <HI>him,</HI> at his time of life, would be irk|&s;ome; he had not a friend alive, and without money, could only
<PB N="76" REF="73">fly to the &s;helter of a workhou&s;e.</Q> He ob&s;erved. <Q>that though a pri|&s;on affords no comfort, yet, there the pri&s;oners re&s;t together; they hear not the voice of the oppre&s;|&s;or: and having proportioned his appetite to the quantity of food he could get, and contracted his wants within very &s;mall limits, he was far from being wretched. Should it plea&s;e God to take him from the world, he was perfectly re&s;igned; but, to remove him from the&s;e walls, except in his coffin and to his grave, would be only to ha&s;ten his di&s;&s;olution, and put an abrupt period to his exi&s;tence.</Q> And indeed, &s;o much did he &s;peak
<PB N="77" REF="74">the &s;entiments of his &s;oul, that upon an enquiry three or four years after|wards, I was informed, that the Chief Ju&s;tice having, from the re|pre&s;entation of the keeper, and a mi&s;taken humanity, ordered him to be relea&s;ed, he became truly mi&s;er|able.</P>
<P>He was no &s;ooner at liberty and without the pri&s;on wicket, than he &s;topped &s;hort, wild as it were and lo&s;t. The broad &s;un-&s;hine was painful to him. His eyes were fix|ed, but he could not weep. Stupe|fied at his change of &s;ituation, his legs, in &s;pite of him, became as im|moveable as his tongue.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="75">CONDUCTED by a charitable hand, he enquired the way to the place where once he lived. His hou&s;e was there no more; a public build|ing was erected on the &s;pot. He knew neither the &s;treet, the town, nor the objects. The adjoining hou&s;es to his own had taken a new form. He endeavoured to recollect them, but he had lived twenty years to long.</P>
<P>Startled; he &s;topped and &s;ighed; and for the fir&s;t time felt the comfort of a jail, <Q>where the wicked cea&s;e from troubling, and where the weary are at re&s;t.</Q> Every face was new, and every thing about him
<PB N="79" REF="76">&s;trange. The only per&s;on he could find, of whom he had the lea&s;t re|collection, was a tottering old man, who formerly had been his &s;ervant; he found him in a garret, living on charity, and from having been con|fined to his room eighteen years, had &s;trength only to pull the cord that opened his door.</P>
<P>THIS poor creature could not re|collect his ma&s;ter, who&s;e face, time and afflictions had &s;o much fur|rowed; and the only comfort his ma&s;ter drew, was, by a participa|tion of his grief, and from a con|viction, that he was not the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of beings. This old do|me&s;tic,
<PB N="80" REF="77">entertained him only with his &s;orrows; told him that his wife was dead; that he had experienced thirty years of wretchedne&s;s; that his children were in &s;ome di&s;tant parts of the world unknown to him, and that every friend he had was gone.</P>
<P>At this the ma&s;ter &s;ighed, and &s;ighed alone; for the other was habituated to di&s;tre&s;s. Broke down with grief, he returns to his pri&s;on, and &s;olicits a re-admi&s;&s;ion. It was refu&s;ed him. And he experienced the force of woe, now more than ever. To have outlived all his re|lations, his friends, nay, a whole
<PB N="81" REF="78">generation. To want a &s;helter, or money to procure one,&mdash;to be de&s;|titute of food and cloaths and every nece&s;&s;ary article.&mdash;The&s;e were thoughts that racked him; but his greate&s;t di&s;quiet was, to be &s;en&s;ible, that a whole generation of men was at once lo&s;t to <HI>him,</HI> which by daily deaths the ma&s;s of mankind do not mi&s;s. <Q>Separated as it were, from &s;o|ciety, I am alive, <HI>alone.</HI></Q> "Death" &s;ays he, <Q>may be terrible, but to die the la&s;t is more &s;o. Glad &s;hall I be, when I can find the grave!</Q></P>
<P>As a bird that has been long con|fined, will hover round its cage, un|ea&s;y
<PB N="82" REF="79">at its liberty, &s;o was this man daily at the pri&s;on wicket, impor|tuning for admi&s;&s;ion; and finding none, he pined gradually away. Grief wore him to the bone, and he fell a martyr to a broken heart. &mdash;And all this perhaps, for having in his hou&s;e a few pounds of tea, or a canni&s;ter of unroa&s;ted coffee!</P>
<P>To this man I was not a little ob|liged. He gave me the character of Ju&s;tice Fleece'em, for that was the magi&s;trate's name by whom I was committed, and told me that <Q>he had formerly been and old cloaths man, and knew the value of money too well not to accept
<PB N="83" REF="80">a bribe, if offered through the medium of his clerk; that though he had received his education in Rag Fair, he did not want for abilities, and had a wonderful pre&s;ence of mind on certain oc|ca&s;ions, of which the following anecdote is a proof. When bu&s;i|ne&s;s at his office is &s;lack, he &s;ends the high con&s;table round the pur|lieus of Drury, to pick up all the &s;traggling women he can find and bring them before him; at the&s;e times they have been brought by &s;cores. Such as can make a golden intere&s;t with his clerk, are generally di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with a repri|mand; but &s;uch as cannot com|mand
<PB N="84" REF="81">half a guinea upon the oc|ca&s;ion, are &s;ure to be &s;ent to Bridewell. It happened that his wor&s;hip had intrigued with one of the&s;e girls at a time and place when he little expected to have been known, and had probably bilked her of her fee; &s;he, unable, for want of money, to make that prevailing application which &s;ome others had done, begged, before &s;he was taken away, that his wor&s;hip would permit her to &s;peak to him privately, as &s;he had &s;omething of the utmo&s;t im|portance to communicate. Cu|rio&s;ity led him to hear her, and &s;he was brought within the bar;
<PB N="85" REF="82">&s;he accordingly reminded him in his ear, of a former <HI>tete-a-tete</HI> that had pa&s;&s;ed between them,</Q> (which, as his wor&s;hip was rather deaf, was overheard by a per&s;on next them,) <Q>and as he was in her debt, &s;he hoped, it would plead as powerfully for her as any pre|&s;ent &s;he could make to his clerk.</Q> <Q>And &s;o woman,</Q> bawls out his wor&s;hip, <Q>that hone&s;t man was your father?&mdash;Well!&mdash;You are a gracele&s;s hu&s;&s;ey; but on <HI>his</HI> ac|count, I will this time forgive you; and I hope it will be a warning to you, to behave bet|ter for the future.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="83">The &s;ituation of the&s;e unhappy girls is truly deplorable. Betrayed perhaps, by the man on whom &s;he fondly doated; and giving too much way to the propen&s;ity of nature, the deluded female &s;acrifices her honour to her love, and for this indi&s;cretion, is turned into the &s;treet, moneyle&s;s and friendle&s;s; here &s;he becomes a &s;lave to di&s;ea&s;e and infamy, and a prey to tho&s;e who are far more de|praved than her&s;elf. Having no|thing to &s;upport her, &s;he has no al|ternative but theft or pro&s;titution; and of the&s;e two evils, &s;he thinks it better to injure her&s;elf than others. But this profe&s;&s;ion requires dre&s;s, and there are not wanting women
<PB N="87" REF="84">to furni&s;h it, for which they make the&s;e girls pay three or four &s;hil|lings a day; but where a girl has a good face and but little credit, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould decamp with her hired cloaths, a woman is appointed to follow her in her nightly round; who never lo&s;es &s;ight of her till &s;he is picked up and taken to a public hou&s;e; there &s;he waits her coming out, and takes from her two thirds of her ill gotten pay. One of the&s;e women was quarrelling with a girl of the town, one evening as I pa&s;&s;|ed along the Strand, and would have proceeded to blows, had &s;he not been attending upon another. "Bl-&s;t your eyes," &s;ays &s;he, <Q>let
<PB N="88" REF="85">me put up my whore and I'll box your for a crown.</Q>&mdash;It is to be re|gretted, gretted, that our police is not better regulated; but whil&s;t our magi&s;trates are &s;o indolent and ignorant, there is little expectation of its being done.</P>
<P>ON my expre&s;&s;ing to this old man my a&s;toni&s;hment at the various ways of getting money in the metropolis, and how &s;orry I was to ob&s;erve, that even ju&s;tice was put up to &s;ale; he gave me to under&s;tand, that Ju&s;|tice Fleece'em had acquired a fortune by his practice; that he was up al|mo&s;t to any villainy; but that, as from his officious indu&s;try, he was a terror to felons, and brought many
<PB N="89" REF="86">&s;coundrels to puni&s;hment who would otherwi&s;e e&s;cape, the law had wink|ed at his conduct, and had even countenanced it by a pen&s;ion.</P>
<P>"THE &s;tate" continued he, <Q>having allotted a reward of forty pounds for the apprehending of hou&s;e-breakers, highway robbers, and the like, it is unknown the &s;ums of money he picks up this way. He has a gang in pay, which is always upon the &s;cout, and the half of every forty pounds he this way gets, he <HI>generou&s;ly</HI> divides among them, keeping the remainder to him&s;elf. And what is the con&s;equence?&mdash;That none
<PB N="90" REF="87">but &s;uch villains as the law al|lows that &s;um for apprehending, are apprehended. An acquaint|ance of mine,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>told me the other day, that, being on bu&s;ine&s;s, at a night cellar in Cow Lane, whil&s;t he was &s;tanding at the bar, there came in a young fellow returned from tran&s;porta|tion, who addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the woman within, with a 'How are you mi&s;tre&s;s?' 'Aye Jack,' &s;ays &s;he, 'is it you?' <Q>Yes,&mdash; it is <HI>I,</HI></Q> replies he, <Q>make me a &s;neaker of gin punch.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Not a drop &s;hall you have here.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Why not?</Q> <Q>I expect,</Q> &s;ays &s;he, <Q>Ju&s;tice Fleece'em's men here every
<PB N="91" REF="88">in&s;tant, and I would not have you taken in my hou&s;e for the world!</Q> <Q>P&s;haw!</Q> &s;ays Jack, <Q>they wont meddle O' <HI>me.</HI>&mdash;They'll get nothing by taking of <HI>me.</HI></Q> And hardly had he uttered the words, but Baildock, the ju&s;|tice's man, and two of his mir|midons entered. Baildock &s;lap|ped him on the &s;houlder, with <Q>So Jack, you're <HI>&s;oon</HI> returned?&mdash; The country, I &s;uppo&s;e was too hot to hold you?</Q>&mdash;<Q>Aye, Ma&s;|ter Baildock,</Q> replies he, <Q>no|thing like old England for me.</Q> Come, will you take a &s;up of punch?</Q> <Q>They drank together and parted; for, continued my
<PB N="92" REF="89">friend, as government allows but little reward for apprehending &s;uch as return from tran&s;porta|tion, this gang of Ju&s;tice Fleece|'em's has it in orders, not to in|terrupt &s;uch, but keep them in view, waiting till they re&s;ort to their old practices; and then to lay hold of them; by which con|duct the apprehenders gain an ample reward.</Q></P>
<P>WITH the&s;e, and &s;uch like anec|dotes, was this man amu&s;ing me on the fir&s;t day of my arrival within the ca&s;tle, for &s;o did the pri&s;oners call their place of confinement, when the keeper brought me word
<PB N="93" REF="90">that Lawyer Grind wanted to &s;peak to me. "By <HI>no</HI> means &s;ee him," &s;ays he, <Q>he is one of tho&s;e petty|fogging ra&s;cals, that prey upon the wretched, and live upon the mi&s;eries of the unfortunate.</Q> <Q>I'll tell you a &s;tory of him,</Q> con|tinues he, <Q>that fell within my own knowledge, and upon the truth of which you may rely. A man of tolerable good connexions was brought in here for a high|way robbery. This fellow ap|plied to him, and amu&s;ed him with hopes of e&s;cape. As a drowning man will, to &s;ave him|&s;elf, even catch at &s;traws, &s;o this unhappy culprit li&s;tened to his
<PB N="94" REF="91">deceitful advi&s;er. He gave him to under&s;tand, that if he could furni&s;h him with ten guineas, he would procure a copy of the in|dictment, and had no doubt of di&s;covering &s;ome error in it, that would in&s;tantly qua&s;h it. The ten guineas were given, but on a &s;econd vi&s;it he was told, that coun&s;el had examined the indict|ment, and not the &s;hadow of a flaw could be found: but, that he was convinced, from the ac|count he had received of the pro|&s;ecutor, that he might be bought off, and of the evidence, that they might be &s;oftened for about twenty pound. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
<PB N="95" REF="92">that twenty pounds. It was given; and a third vi&s;it told him, that the pro&s;ecutor had been ap|plied to, and was found incor|ruptible, and the evidence too re&s;pectable to be influenced; that the ca&s;h had been expended in bribing tho&s;e, who were &s;uppo&s;|ed to have &s;ome weight with the evidence, but they could not &s;uc|ceed.</Q> <Q>However,</Q> &s;ays Grind, <Q>as I have always people ready to prove an <HI>alibi</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is to prove, that the pri&s;oner was in &s;ome other place, than the place alledged, when the fact for which he is arraigned, was committed.</NOTE>, if you can rai&s;e thirty pounds more, there is no doubt of &s;ucce&s;s. The poor
<PB N="96" REF="93">wretch applies to his friends, and the&s;e thirty pounds were rai&s;ed; but they turned out as ineffectual as the la&s;t. The trial came on, the <HI>alibi</HI> was overthrown, and the poor devil convicted. Could nothing more be done?&mdash;Yes, for ten more, he would move an arre&s;t of judgment, for the pro|ceedings had been illegal. Here he was foiled again; coun&s;el had exerted them&s;elves, but the at|tempt was over-ruled.&mdash;There was, however, another &s;tep, in which he flattered him&s;elf he &s;hould be more &s;ucce&s;sful. This was by a proper application of thirty guineas, to bring over the
<PB N="97" REF="94">Recorder to make a favourable report.&mdash;This &s;um was al&s;o got, but the means equally un&s;ucce&s;s|ful. In this hopele&s;s &s;ituation, the attorney addre&s;&s;es him again. <Q>If he could any ways contrive, through his friends, to rai&s;e twen|ty pounds more, a petition &s;hould be pre&s;ented to the throne, and care &s;hould be taken to get it well backed at the council board, and he might <HI>rely</HI> on a pardon. He u&s;ually contrived the matter to end, long before it got &s;o far, but your ca&s;e,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>is an un|common one, which has hitherto baffled all my endeavours, but in this final &s;tep, I <HI>never</HI> fail.</Q> En|couraged
<PB N="98" REF="95">by this declaration, e|very friend, as for life, was im|portuned, and this la&s;t twenty pounds procured, but all to no purpo&s;e. The death warrant was &s;igned, and an order came down for execution. In a di&s;tracted &s;tate of mind, the poor wretch &s;ends for his lawyer again, re|minds him of the many promi&s;es he had made, the many great &s;ums he had received, and a&s;ked him, 'if there were no hopes after <HI>all?</HI>' 'Hopes,' &s;ays he, to be &s;ure there are. The peti|tion is &s;o &s;trongly worded, and &s;o powerfully backed, that take my word for it, they <HI>cannot</HI> hang
<PB N="99" REF="96">you&mdash;they <HI>dare</HI> not hang you,&mdash; and there was not the lea&s;t doubt but he would be left out of the death warrant.</Q>&mdash;'Aye, Sir,' re|turns the de&s;pairing criminal, <Q>it was on this account I &s;ent for you. The death warrant <HI>is</HI> &s;ign|ed,&mdash;<HI>I</HI> am <HI>in</HI> that warrant, and an order is come down for exe|cution on Wedne&s;day morning.</Q> <Q>This the attorney <HI>could</HI> not &s;tand;</Q>&mdash;<Q>Execution!</Q> exclaimed he, <Q>Exe|cution!&mdash;Well&mdash;<HI>let</HI> 'em hang you, &mdash;<HI>let</HI> 'em hang you, and d&mdash;n <HI>me,</HI> if it &s;hall not be the wor&s;t job they ever did in their lives!</Q>&mdash;<Q>At this, he turned upon his heel, and left his deluded client to his fate.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="97">THIS &s;tory determined me not to &s;ee Mr. Grind; I &s;ent him word my ca&s;e was of a nature not to need his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and therefore I would not trouble him; I thanked my friend for his admonition, and re|&s;olved to tru&s;t to my&s;elf. Not knowing the nature of a night-cel|lar, which had been dropped in con|ver&s;ation, I wi&s;hed for &s;ome account of one, and reque&s;ted my advi&s;er to make me acquainted with what he knew of them. He gave me the following account:</P>
<P><Q>A NIGHT-CELLAR is an ale|hou&s;e under ground, in &s;ome populous, but &s;ecret part of the
<PB N="101" REF="98">town, which is kept open all night, for the re&s;ort of whores and rogues, and all &s;uch per&s;ons, who&s;e actions will not bear the te&s;t of day-light. In &s;ome of the&s;e places of rendezvous, vil|lains of note are generally to be found, and through the treachery of gangs in general, that of Ju&s;|tice Fleece'em's becomes well-acquainted with their per&s;ons. There is &s;eldom a daring robbery or burglary committed, but Bail|dock and his crew get &s;ome in|telligence of it; and though they are not able immediately to fix it on any particular man, they will &s;oon trace it out, and take
<PB N="102" REF="99">the offender into cu&s;tody. Dar|ing as the&s;e &s;coundrels are, there is an unaccountable infatuation in mo&s;t of them, that will lead them to &s;urrender them&s;elves to Fleec'em's men, without vio|lence. Baildock has many a time &s;earched the&s;e night-cellars alone, without fear or danger. As madmen will, in their raving intervals, cea&s;e raving at &s;ight of their keeper, and &s;ubmit quietly to him, &s;o will mo&s;t of the&s;e villains yield, without re&s;i&s;tance, to the mandates of Baildock. Whether they are awed by his undaunted re&s;olution, or di&s;may|ed by con&s;cience, or any other
<PB N="103" REF="100">motive, I cannot &s;ay; but Bail|dock has been known to carry off from the&s;e places, the man he looked for, and without the lea&s;t oppo&s;ition. <Q>Ma&s;ter Baildock,</Q> &s;ays one of the&s;e fellows, as he approached him in one of his midnight &s;earches, <Q>I hope you are not come for I?</Q> <Q>No, Tom,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>it is not <HI>you</HI> I want, but Dick Houn&s;low, and I &s;ee him yonder. Come, Dick, you mu&s;t go with me.</Q>&mdash;<Q>D&mdash;n me,</Q> &s;ays Dick, <Q>if I did not dream as much a day or two ago;</Q> then addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to his compa|ny, <Q>well, gentlemen,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>God ble&s;s you&mdash;this &s;e&s;&s;ions will
<PB N="104" REF="101">be the end of <HI>me</HI>&mdash;may <HI>you</HI> outlive many of them!</Q>&mdash;and walked off with Baildock, as quietly as if in irons.</Q></P>
<P>WAS I to relate to the reader, all the information I picked up during the time I was in this pri&s;on, it would fill a volume; and amu&s;ing as it might have been at any other time, I was too much taken up with my own affairs to attend much to it. I was to prepare for a &s;econd examination. A magi&s;trate has cer|tainly no authority to bring up pri|&s;oners before him to a &s;econd, or a third examination; if there is &s;uf|ficient charge again&s;t them for com|mitment,
<PB N="105" REF="102">they are to be committed for trial; if not, he is to di&s;charge them; but Ju&s;tice Fleece'em made a trade of his profe&s;&s;ion, and his hou&s;e was a kind of petty court of judicature, where pri&s;oners went, as it were, through a formal trial. It was &s;o far of u&s;e indeed, that to a villain it was a good preparatory to his arraignment at the Old Bailey, and was frequently a means of his finding methods to get off.</P>
<P>THOUGH appearances were &s;trong again&s;t me, being wrapt up in con|&s;cious innocence, I was convinced that the arrows of malevolence could not hurt me. I was not without
<PB N="106" REF="103">money, and I &s;et about collecting the evidence in my favour. I re|collected that a porter at the auc|tioneer's was pre&s;ent when I bought the watch; and that on the evening when the pro&s;ecutor was robbed, I kept my room with a cold, and had at that time a neighbouring apothe|cary to attend me; the&s;e people, I was per&s;uaded, would ju&s;tify my in|nocence, if the auctioneer was &s;o relentle&s;s, as not to appear in my behalf. Indeed, I had little favour to expect from him; for &s;uch is the &s;trange conduct of mankind, that whil&s;t a man, who knows you, has rea&s;on to think he is well with you, he will do you no open injury, but,
<PB N="107" REF="104">if convenience, or any circum&s;tance has once led him to treat you ill, by his &s;acrificing your intere&s;t to his, &s;o that he de&s;pairs of your ever for|giving him, he becomes the mo&s;t inveterate enemy you have; and, though you have never given him the lea&s;t offence, it is all the fame, he acts and &s;peaks of you in future, as if you had been a thorn in his &s;ide ever &s;ince he had any knowledge of you. It was not &s;o, however, with this man; though, as I &s;ince learned from his porter, he was the means of my being apprehended, by a fal&s;e in&s;inuation; even this man, thinking he had puni&s;hed me &s;uffi|ciently, thought proper, on appli|cation,
<PB N="108" REF="105">to appear in my favour; of cour&s;e, notwith&s;tanding, on my &s;e|cond examination, the pro&s;ecutor was not pre&s;ent; I was acquitted, with the lo&s;s only of the watch I had purcha&s;ed, and the expence of a few pounds in me&s;&s;engers, fees and other contingencies. Before, however, I left the Ju&s;tice, I took the liberty to a&s;k for my watch, which as I had fairly purcha&s;ed, I thought my|&s;elf entitled to, when all the &s;ati&s;|faction I could get was, <Q>The fir&s;t of James the fir&s;t, chapter twen|ty-one, &s;ays, The &s;ale of goods in London, wrongfully come by, &s;hall not alter the property; of cour&s;e it belongs to the <HI>pro&s;ecu|tor.</HI></Q>
<PB N="109" REF="106">And I was afterwards told, upon inquiry, that on the pro&s;ecu|tor's demanding his watch, he could obtain no other an&s;wer than, <Q>The law &s;ays, Goods &s;old in open market &s;hall be the property of the buyer; now, all London is an open market, and every day, except Sunday, market-day in London; therefore, it belongs to the <HI>pri&s;oner.</HI></Q> I thought little, how|ever, about the watch, or my mo|ney, happy to owe my acquittal to my innocence; indeed, my watch was an expence to me which I could not well afford; for as it was frequently out of order, when|ever I carried it to a watchmaker
<PB N="110" REF="107">I was &s;ure to have &s;ix or &s;even &s;hillings to pay. This is one of their modes of getting money; though little or nothing is the mat|ter with a watch, they will pre|tend it requires repair, which you cannot contradict, and make you pay accordingly.</P>

<P><PB N="119" REF="116">HAVING been u&s;ed to di&s;gui&s;es, I made an engagement with an old cloaths man in Monmouth-&s;treet, to equip me with &s;uch as I had oc|ca&s;ion for; &s;ometimes I was a foot|man, &s;ometimes an officer, &s;ome|times a clergyman, and &s;ometimes a blackguard. As a footman, I mix|ed with the knights of the rainbow in the lobbies of the Opera-hou&s;e and hou&s;es of Parliament, and by inventing a number of &s;tories of fa|milies where I had lived, and the participation of a pint or two of por|ter, I frequently &s;ucked their brains, and got acquainted with a number of private and entertaining anecdotes. As an officer, I was at the Bedford,
<PB N="120" REF="117">the Smyrna, George's, and other coffee-hou&s;es of repute, and by join|ing in conver&s;ation with indu&s;tri|ous and attentive ears, I picked up a variety of intelligence re&s;pecting &s;tate&s;men, general officers, theatres and players. As a clergyman, I got acce&s;s at St. James's, gave the king, when, talking with certain per&s;ons, a plea&s;ant countenance or a &s;our one, according as I wi&s;hed,&mdash;enter|ed into the characters of individuals, according to their looks in the draw|ing room; and when I wanted a a little better information than I could pick up at coffee-hou&s;es, I ap|peared at court in regimentals; and there I could have filled a new&s;pa|per
<PB N="121" REF="118">at any time with the &s;candal I heard. As a blackguard, I made my way into all city, and other meetings of the people, and what I could not collect with my ears, I made up with invention: in &s;hort, I became &s;o u&s;eful to a new&s;paper, that I was con&s;tantly employed. But their pay was poor, not more than &s;ix-pence for a common para|graph, a &s;hilling for a matter of fact or &s;candal, and half a crown for the death of a king. I was at la&s;t thought worthy to be admitted into their cabinet of literary men, who met on a Sunday evening, the only lei&s;ure day in the week, where Dreadnought, our editor, pre&s;ided;
<PB N="122" REF="119">from him we received our in&s;truc|tions for the &s;ix days following.&mdash; He was a de&s;perate man, capable of undertaking any thing, and was placed in this department, not for po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing any literary talents, but for being adequate to fighting his way through any dirty work that was expected of him. A clergy|man was once propo&s;ed to fill this office, but as clergymen cannot, or mu&s;t not fight, and, as the argu|ment of a proprietor on this propo&s;al had weight, namely, <Q>if you em|ploy an eccle&s;ia&s;tic&mdash;what is to become of your <HI>duels?</HI></Q> Dread|nought was appointed; it being found nece&s;&s;ary, as the editor was
<PB N="123" REF="120">the o&s;ten&s;ible man, that he &s;hould be one that was not ea&s;ily to be fright|ened. And as the occa&s;ional account of a duel, between the editor and a per&s;on held forth to the public in an infamous light, generally in|crea&s;ed the &s;ale of the paper for &s;ome time afterwards, great pains were taken to bring matters to &s;uch a <HI>fortunate</HI> i&s;&s;ue. But the&s;e men are generally well paid in the end, for the party they e&s;pou&s;e &s;eldom fails to reward them.</P>
<P>I CONTINUED in this employ &s;ome time, but my career was interrupted, through the ungener|ou&s;ne&s;s of my employer. I had, in
<PB N="124" REF="121">order to obtain his favour, charged a re&s;pectable per&s;on, of great rank, with high-trea&s;on; a pro&s;ecution was commenced again&s;t the printer, and nothing could atone for the offence but giving up the author; and as Jonathan Wild would, at any time, impeach his whole gang to &s;ave him&s;elf, &s;o this multiplier of daily &s;candal, thought proper to give in my name to the pro&s;ecutor, and I was obliged to &s;ecrete my&s;elf.&mdash;I lay hid &s;ome time, and the matter blew over. However, as I ob&s;erved the pay being poor, the &s;ervice danger|ous, and the employ &s;uch as did not agree with my feelings, I look|ed abroad for &s;ome other. It gave
<PB N="125" REF="122">me, indeed, an in&s;ight into the arca|na of a new&s;paper, and if I &s;uffer|ed in reputation, I improved in worldly knowledge. I there found, that, like the generality of man|kind, nothing came ami&s;s to them. They would frequently abu&s;e a cha|racter, and promi&s;e a continuance of &s;uch abu&s;e, merely to draw from that party hu&s;h money: if any &s;um was offered for the non-in&s;ertion of a paragraph, and a greater &s;um was tendered for its in&s;ertion, it was &s;ure to be in, and <HI>vice ver&s;a.</HI> Far be it from me to include every proprietor of a public print under this general cen&s;ure; there is &s;carce a new&s;paper printed, but what has many pro|prietors
<PB N="126" REF="123">who re&s;ide in different parts of the kingdom, and who&s;e opinion, with re&s;pect to its conduct, is too often over-ruled by the acting part|ners; of cour&s;e, they cannot be re|&s;pon&s;ible for its contents; but this does not alter the in ca&s;e general.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<P>THE next place I got, and this through the means of an ac|quaintance, was that of an amanu|en&s;is to a clergyman. He was a man of &s;ome fortune, and like mo&s;t clergy|men of fortune, too indolent to write his own &s;ermons. So he was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the church, he cared little what became of the congre|gation.
<PB N="128" REF="125">He was the younger &s;on of a good family, had a chapel in London, a fellow&s;hip at Cam|bridge, and an annuity of 200 <HI>l.</HI> a year; &s;ufficient together to enable him to keep a pair of hor&s;es. When in town he wore a large grizzel wig, a pair of &s;quare-toed &s;hoes, in &s;hort dre&s;&s;ed like, and had all the form|ality of, a Pre&s;byterian; though a young man, he &s;crewed up his face into a primitive form, and would &s;carce &s;uffer a &s;mile upon his coun|tenance; and there was &s;uch an af|fected &s;everity in his manner, that you would have taken him for a &s;aint; but when in the country, he was a buck of the fir&s;t head,
<PB N="129" REF="126">wore a &s;mart bob wig, leather breeches, and was always in boots: he had but a &s;mall &s;tock of &s;er|mons, and I was engaged, for a few months, to provide him with a greater. Having purcha&s;ed a &s;et of manu&s;cripts, which he could not well read, my bu&s;ine&s;s was to tran|&s;cribe them, and now and then throw in a pa&s;&s;age or two which he occa&s;ionally penned on a &s;lip of paper, as his lei&s;ure moments from hunting, drinking, and the card-table would admit. Indeed, I fre|quently helped him out, very often adding &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of my own; &s;o that he would often &s;ay I &s;hould make a very good par&s;on. He was
<PB N="130" REF="127">once, when at Cambridge, called upon to preach in the morning at St. Mary's, before the univer&s;ity, and not having a proper &s;ermon upon the occa&s;ion, nor being able to compo&s;e or to compile one, was under a thou&s;and anxieties; for he &s;tudied appearances more than mo&s;t young men in the church. At la&s;t a circum&s;tance happened, that relieved him from his pain. While in Cambridge, we dwelt in college; and it &s;o happened, that a fellow of the &s;ame community who lived in the ad|joining rooms, was appointed to preach at the &s;ame church in the afternoon. This young gentleman,
<PB N="131" REF="128">who was a very good writer, and who took a great deal more pains than my ma&s;ter, delivered his &s;er|mon aloud every morning before his gla&s;s in his own room, in order to acquit him&s;elf well on the day of exhibition; and as the partition between the two apartments was only a wain&s;cot, I could di&s;tinctly hear every word: accordingly, with my ma&s;ter's con&s;ent, I took down his &s;ermon <HI>verbatim,</HI> and he preach|ed it in the morning. This being unknown to the other gentleman, the &s;ame di&s;cour&s;e was delivered in the afternoon. Though he who penned it laboured to have it be|lieved that he was the author of it,
<PB N="132" REF="129">it did not avail, the my&s;tery was not unravelled, my ma&s;ter had all the credit, and the afternoon preacher was con&s;idered only as a purloiner of the copy.</P>
<P>HAVING furni&s;hed my ma&s;ter with about four dozen of &s;ermons, which he called a pretty good &s;tock, he propo&s;ed to di&s;charge me, and took &s;ome pains to recommend me to a friend, as a very u&s;eful hand in the divinity way; but his friend was of another ca&s;t, he always compo&s;ed his &s;ermons him&s;elf; per&s;uaded no one could do them &s;o well, though when compo&s;ed, few could under&s;tand them, from
<PB N="133" REF="130">the variety of new words he u&s;ed, and much fewer liked them. He u&s;ed to con&s;ole him&s;elf however with ob&s;erv|ing, that he really pitied his congre|gation for the vexation they mu&s;t feel, at hearing &s;o many fine things of which they were neither the writer nor the &s;peaker. It is &s;aid, that tho&s;e who are bit by a mad animal par|take of its nature and in&s;anity. If this be the ca&s;e, I am per&s;uaded this friend of my ma&s;ter's had been bit by a bookworm, for he was literally literary mad. See him when you would, he was never without a book, and when at home was almo&s;t overwhelmed with them. Every new publication he purcha&s;ed,
<PB N="134" REF="131">it be in what language it would; for though he was ma&s;ter of but one, he fancied him&s;elf well read in all, and always prided him&s;elf in having had the fir&s;t copy <HI>wet</HI> from the pre&s;s. Oft have I &s;een him in his &s;tudy, almo&s;t bu|ried in volumes. They lay all round him and his table, piled high upon the floor, and as he would never &s;uffer a &s;ervant to du&s;t them, for fear of derangement, and was too much occupied in <HI>little</HI> thoughts to do it him&s;elf, they were covered with du&s;t. Here he would &s;ome|times bury him&s;elf whole days in little more than re-arranging them, and would be almo&s;t lo&s;t in a cloud
<PB N="135" REF="132">of du&s;t. He &s;aid, that in the Eng|li&s;h language there was a <HI>paucity</HI> of expre&s;&s;ion that required to be <HI>abun|dified,</HI> and he laboured to repair this defect. He called him&s;elf a <HI>nealogi&s;t,</HI> or a former of new words. Whenever he received a pre&s;ent, he returned his <HI>civilities</HI> and thanked his friend for his <HI>prevenient</HI> polite|ne&s;s; and when he &s;ent his old black wai&s;tcoat to be new dipped, he reque&s;ted the dyer to <HI>re-nigri&s;y</HI> it. There was not an author abroad with whom he did not court a corre&s;pondence, nor any &s;cribbler at home whom he did not pe&s;ter with his vi&s;its. He would &s;hew a card from Rou&s;&s;eau, and a
<PB N="136" REF="133">letter from Voltaire, as a medalli&s;t would exhibit a Cromwell's <HI>&s;ilver penny,</HI> or an <HI>Otho.</HI> As I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;peak of this man a|gain, I &s;hall drop the &s;ubject now, with &s;aying, that, as during my &s;tay with my ma&s;ter, I found out the art of making &s;ermons, and as no en|quiry is ever made before a man officiates as a clergyman, whether he be really in orders or not; flatter|ing my&s;elf I &s;hould make as con&s;cientious a prie&s;t as the gene|rality of par&s;ons are; and being &s;o little of a Roman catholic, as not to conceive, that the laying on of hands by a bi&s;hop, can confer grace, any more than that a few words
<PB N="137" REF="134">mumbled over a piece of bread, can make any alteration in its nature, I determined to take no other place, but to &s;tart forward in the profe&s;&s;ion my&s;elf; and, as this thought &s;truck me &s;oon after I commenced an aman|uen&s;is, I wrote two copies of every &s;ermon I was directed to tran&s;cribe, and kept one for my own u&s;e. The&s;e amounted in the end to &s;ome dozens; accordingly, being furni&s;hed with all the requi&s;ites of a modern par&s;on, namely, a few &s;ermons, an iron grey &s;uit, and a &s;tock of impu|dence; as &s;oon as I quitted my ma&s;|ter, I applied to Mr. Snuffle, in Pa|terno&s;ter Row, for employ.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="135">THIS <HI>gentleman</HI> was formerly a pari&s;h clerk, but growing tired with &s;aying amen for twenty pounds a year, he has found out a new me|thod of being &s;erviceable to him&s;elf, under the idea of being u&s;eful to the clergy. As there are regi&s;ter offices for a variety of re&s;pectable wants, for hou&s;es, &s;ervants, whores, &amp;c, &s;o this is a regi&s;ter office for par|&s;ons, a kind of <HI>divinity-&s;hop</HI> in the city of London for hiring of preach|ers, readers, and &s;o on, by the day or the week as occa&s;ion requires. For this purpo&s;e, he keeps a li&s;t of unemployed clergy, of all ages and characters, to &s;uit certain congre|gations; &s;ome for example, attend
<PB N="139" REF="136">much to the voice and to the action, and as they never take their eyes from the preacher during the whole &s;ermon, they wi&s;h for &s;omething tolerable to look at. The&s;e he would furni&s;h with a &s;mart prig preacher of twenty-five, who would keep them awake by an exertion of the voice, and a di&s;play of the arms; to others, who do not like to be taught by boys, and had rather doze away a heavy hour or two, which the law will not &s;uffer them to employ in their re&s;pective occu|pations, and who go to church more to keep up appearances, than from any &s;pirit of devotion, he would provide a monotoni&s;t of &s;ixty. For
<PB N="140" REF="137">&s;uch men, like the tale-tellers in Scotland, have a happy knack of compo&s;ing a congregation into a comfortable nap.</P>
<P>FROM this li&s;t he &s;elects his preachers, and lets them out for a &s;tipulated &s;um, according to the duty they are to perform, taking for him&s;elf as agent, ten per cent. and one &s;hilling extra for tho&s;e he accommodates with a gown and ca&s;|&s;ack.

</SP>
<P>IT is to the&s;e, and &s;uch like in|dignities, to which the clergy are obliged to &s;ubmit, that the function owes it's degradation. Having re|ceived the be&s;t of educations, and flattering my&s;elf I had equal abilities in compiling and delivering a di&s;|cour&s;e with the be&s;t of them, I per|&s;uaded my&s;elf that, whil&s;t I kept my own &s;ecret, I could do no great harm. I could pa&s;s an examination; and of cour&s;e, could have taken orders if I plea&s;ed, and, as a late Bi&s;hop of Che&s;ter would never or|dain
<PB N="150" REF="147">a man till be had officiated as a deacon for three years, to &s;ee how he took to the profe&s;&s;ion, I conceiv|ed there could be no harm in my putting my&s;elf upon a &s;imilar trial.</P>
<P>HAVING then applied to this &s;ame Mr Snuffle, he &s;oon found me employ, and as I acquitted my&s;elf to his &s;atisfaction, and in a manner that did him credit, I never was idle; but an ill-judged par&s;imony of mine overturned the bucket pre|&s;ently. I was employed to read prayers on a week-day in a large pari&s;h, for which I had my &s;hilling, but being called, at that time, on more important bu&s;ine&s;s, to the
<PB N="151" REF="148">other end of the town, I appointed a deputy, and gave him half my fees, but he was &s;o out of &s;pirits at being obliged to officiate, at a price &s;o degrading to the profe&s;&s;ion, and &s;o derogatory to the <HI>honour</HI> of the <HI>cloth,</HI> that he did not exert him&s;elf &s;ufficiently to be heard, and on the clerk's hinting to him, after &s;er|vice, that he feared the congrega|tion did not hear him, his an&s;wer was, <Q>How do you think, friend, I am paid?</Q> <Q>I pre&s;ume,</Q> re|plies the clerk, <Q>the u&s;ual compli|ment.</Q> "Not &s;o, Sir," returns the par&s;on, <Q>I am paid but <HI>half price,</HI> and I therefore only read my <HI>half-be&s;t.</HI></Q> This &s;tory was
<PB N="152" REF="149">carried to Mr. Snuffle; and, for at|tempting to take the bread out of his mouth, I was immediately &s;truck off his li&s;t.</P>
<P>I, AT this time, got intelligence, that a certain Vi&s;count in the we&s;t, having married a woman of low fa|mily, who had a maiden &s;i&s;ter, pro|po&s;ed to give any clergyman, that would take her to wife, a living in his di&s;po&s;al, then vacant, of five hundred pounds a year. I deter|mined to look after this living, for though I was not in orders, as I have ob&s;erved before, being &s;uffici|ently qualified, I could ea&s;ily have been ordained; the nece&s;&s;ary te&s;ti|monials
<PB N="153" REF="150">I made no doubt of procur|ing. This lady lived at a market town in the neighbourhood of Ox|ford: I accordingly inquired of the man who drove the &s;tage-coach be|tween that town and London, whe|ther there was an a&s;&s;embly at that place, he told me there was, and promi&s;ed to bring me word, the next time he came up, on what day the next a&s;&s;embly was to be. This information being procured, I hired an elegant po&s;t-chai&s;e for the jour|ney, and took a friend with me, for whom I borrowed a &s;mart livery, and who followed as my &s;ervant on hor&s;eback. I let this friend into my &s;cheme, and promi&s;ing him a reward
<PB N="154" REF="151">if I &s;ucceeded, gave him his in&s;truc|tions; which were, to pa&s;s me for a man of good family and fortune. Thus, with two of my be&s;t &s;ermons in my pocket, I &s;et off for the place I was bound to, and arrived there on a Friday evening, five days, as the coachman told me, before the a&s;&s;embly day. Having &s;ent for the landlord of the hou&s;e where I was, I inquired, who &s;erved the church? he told me, <Q>a young gentleman from Oxford.</Q> <Q>My rea&s;on, friend,</Q> &s;ays I, <Q>for a&s;king, is, that I am a clergyman, and mean to pa&s;&s; a few days here, and, if I thought it would be agreeable to your mini&s;ter, I would ea&s;e
<PB N="155" REF="152">him of his duty on Sunday.</Q> His reply was: <Q>I have no doubt Sir, but he would he very glad of the offer; it is a long way to Oxford, and the roads, from the late rains, very bad. To-morrow is market day there, and as &s;eve|ral of our farmers will be going, if you think proper to write a letter, I will &s;end it.</Q> This let|ter was written, and the an&s;wer, &s;uch as I wi&s;hed. On Sunday I preached; and, from the great atten|tion that was paid me on all &s;ides, I conceive that I acquitted my&s;elf with eclat; but the object of my jour|ney, however, was, unfortunately for me, not at church. As I came
<PB N="156" REF="153">down from the pulpit, an elderly lady, after paying me &s;ome compli|ments on my &s;ermon, a&s;ked me, if I made nay &s;tay in that town? On my an&s;wering in the affirmative, &s;he told me her name, and reque&s;ted my company to dinner. I waited on her, and found her the go&s;&s;ip of the place. From her I acquired e|very information I wi&s;hed, and might, if I plea&s;ed, have learned the hi&s;tory of every family in the neighbourhood. Among other in|formation, however, I found to my mortification, that the a&s;&s;embly was not to be &s;o &s;oon as I expected, by a fortnight.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="154">ON my return to my quarters, I begged the landlord's company, and among other things, a&s;ked him, who was mayor of the town, and what kind of a man he was; he in|formed me, that he was a re&s;pecta|ble trade&s;man, a per&s;on of property, and a good-natured well-bred man. This account &s;o met my wi&s;hes, that I called for paper, and wrote the following card, to be di&s;patched the next morning.</P>
<P><Q>THE gentleman who preached ye&s;terday, pre&s;ents his compli|ments to Mr. Mayor, and, if he will give him leave, will do him|&s;elf
<PB N="158" REF="155">the honour to drink tea with him this afternoon.</Q></P>
<P>THE an&s;wer returned was:</P>
<P><Q>MR. Mayor's compliments to the gentleman who preached, and &s;hall be proud of the honour of his company.</Q></P>
<P>WHEN evening came, I ordered my carriage, (for this, and the ton|gue of my &s;ervant gave me no &s;mall credit) waited on the Mayor, and was politely received. His hou&s;e was full of well-dre&s;&s;ed men and women, collected, no doubt, for the plea&s;ure of reconnoitering me.
<PB N="159" REF="156">Conceiving &s;ome apology nece&s;&s;ary for this &s;elf-invitation, I addre&s;&s;ed him thus before all the company: <Q>This abrupt introduction of my|&s;elf, Mr. Mayor, may require &s;ome apology; I am here upon a little excur&s;ion, and as being at an inn is irk&s;ome, where I have not the happine&s;s of being ac|quainted, I make it a rule to in|troduce my&s;elf, as I have done here, to the polite&s;t families in the town where I am.</Q> The gentlemen &s;miled applau&s;e, the la|dies tittered behind their fans; but I had the &s;atisfaction to find my&s;elf very well-received. Indeed, I want|ed no further introduction any where;
<PB N="160" REF="157">when the company pre&s;ent found I came down for the a&s;&s;embly, and had an intention of &s;taying &s;ome little time, invitations pa&s;&s;ed regu|larly round; one engaged me to din|ner the next day, another the day following, and &s;o on, but in all the&s;e parties I met not with the lady I wi&s;hed to &s;ee; &s;he being con&s;ider|ed as beneath the company I was then in. The Mayor, I found, was a plea&s;ant man, and Jack among the maids. He was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, that <Q>as I had come down to honour their a&s;&s;embly, of which he was the founder, he was truly con|cerned to think the day was &s;o far di&s;tant, as to fear the lo&s;ing
<PB N="161" REF="158">me; in order, therefore, that I might not be di&s;appointed, he would convene the ladies, and have a dance at the inn where I was.</Q> He returned my vi&s;it, however, the next morning, and with a melancholy countenance, told me, <Q>the girls were of late grown &s;o &s;queami&s;h, that they objected to dancing at a public hou&s;e; and that, as their a&s;&s;em|bly was in its infancy, he could not permit them the u&s;e of the town hall, left the neigh|bouring gentry &s;hould, on hear|ing of this dance, be di&s;plea&s;ed that they had not notice of it; but that if I would do them the
<PB N="162" REF="159">honour to &s;tay over the next Sun|day, he would adverti&s;e it in the Oxford Gazette on the en&s;uing Saturday, and, on my account, would fix the a&s;&s;embly on the Thur&s;day following, which was a week &s;ooner than the &s;tated time.</Q> I of cour&s;e acknowledged my&s;elf obliged, and agreed to it. Not having yet met, nor being like|ly to meet, in the company I was with, the lady I was in &s;earch of, I excu&s;ed my&s;elf from a party one af|ternoon, purpo&s;ely to wait upon her. She lived with her mother, a wi|dow; determining, therefore, to introduce my&s;elf, I wrote a card to the mother, &s;imilar to the one I
<PB N="163" REF="160">&s;ent to the Mayor, and &s;he returned he compliments, &s;aying, <Q>as &s;he pre&s;umed I had &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s with her, &s;he &s;hould be glad to &s;ee me.</Q> I went there in my carriage, and &s;aw the old lady, but Mi&s;s was not with her; how|ever, &s;he made her appearance with the tea-table, and expre&s;&s;ed a con|cern that &s;he was not at church la&s;t Sunday, as &s;he &s;hould have heard, by all accounts, a very excellent &s;ermon, and very gracefully deliver|ed. I entered into the chit-chat of the town, the propo&s;ed dance, and the politene&s;s of the Mayor; told her, the a&s;&s;embly was to be the Thur&s;day following, and hoped &s;he
<PB N="164" REF="161">would be there; her reply was, <Q>She never had been at the a&s;&s;em|bly, nor did &s;he know &s;he &s;hould be admitted, for the ladies of that place did not think her good e|nough to mix with them.</Q> At this the mother fired, and &s;aid, <Q>her daughter was as good as the be&s;t, and &s;he was a fool to keep away;</Q> I favoured the idea, and encouraged her to go, and told her, <Q>that if &s;he would do me the honour to dance with me, I &s;hould be proud of her as a partner, and would conduct her there and back. Should I go,</Q> &s;ays &s;he, <Q>I &s;hall have no objections to dance with you, but that is uncertain.</Q> So
<PB N="165" REF="162">far introduced, I improved the ac|quaintance; called on her a day or two before the a&s;&s;embly; prevailed on her to accompany me there, and danced with her; and, we became &s;o familiar before the clo&s;e of the evening, that I told her I was ena|moured with her, and &s;olicited per|mi&s;&s;ion to pay my addre&s;&s;es to her. With a great deal of candour and good-nature, &s;he acknowledged her|&s;elf obliged to me for the preference I had &s;hewn to her before other ladies, but a&s;&s;ured me, &s;he was engaged, and to a brother clergyman; to whom &s;he is &s;ince married.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="163">FINDING my plan here abortive, I quitted the place, and returned to London, having been ab&s;ent from it near three weeks; and, being in daily apprehen&s;ion of its being found out that I was not in orders, and dreading the demand of the man of whom I had the carriage and hor&s;es, which amounted to near twenty pounds, and which I was unable to pay, I retired from my profe&s;&s;ion, and concealed my&s;elf under a differ|ent character.</P>
<P>WHEN I reflected upon my con|duct, and the deceptions I u&s;ed, I held my&s;elf in dete&s;tation; but I &s;oon reconciled it to my&s;elf by the
<PB N="167" REF="164">plea of nece&s;&s;ity, and the collateral one of meaning well; for had I obtained that young lady's con&s;ent, and had a promi&s;e of the living as a portion, I would have embraced a clerical life, and, I am bold to &s;ay, would have acted in that life with honour and probity. As it is, I was re&s;erved for a different &s;ituation. There is a fatality, I am convinced, in the lives of all men, that work|eth wonderfully for their good; and, unle&s;s it be con&s;tantly counteract|ed, will gain ground gradually to its con&s;ummation.</P>
<P>AS I &s;et out with making u&s;eful remarks on the various pa&s;&s;ages in
<PB N="168" REF="165">my life, for the improvement and entertainment of my readers; I can|not omit dwelling a little longer on the clerical profe&s;&s;ion, and ob&s;erving, that though it's followers draw the many indignities they meet with too often upon them&s;elves, yet their po|verty and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation, are fre|quently the occa&s;ions of it. The idea of bringing up a &s;on a gentle|man has &s;poiled many a good trade&s;|man, and has thrown many upon the church whom &s;he is unable to maintain. Lecture&s;hips have been con&s;idered as a tolerable provi&s;ion for tho&s;e who are not provided with livings or curacies; but the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of lecture&s;hips, if we believe
<PB N="169" REF="166">the &s;ame ingenious gentleman, who has favoured the world with his conference with Mr. Snuffle, <Q>has contributed in a great mea&s;ure to bring upon the whole body of the clergy, that contempt into which they are now fallen. The choice of a lecturer is generally ve&s;ted in the pari&s;hioners at large, as they are paid by a voluntary contribution. The&s;e pari&s;hioners for the mo&s;t part, con&s;i&s;t of or|dinary trade&s;men, &s;ometimes ve|ry low mechanics, per&s;ons not always of the mo&s;t refined man|ners, or mo&s;t delicate &s;en&s;ations. I had not been three weeks in London,</Q> &s;ays this gentleman,
<PB N="170" REF="167"><Q>but &s;trolling one Sunday after|noon into a church in the city, I heard the clerk, after &s;ervice, by order of the ve&s;try, declare the lecture&s;hip vacant, and invite the clergy, however dignified or di&s;|tingui&s;hed, to be candidates for it, and to give in their names by the en&s;uing Sunday. Having no clerical provi&s;ion, I no &s;ooner heard this <HI>church-&s;erjeant</HI> beating up for recruits, than I immedi|ately re&s;olved to <HI>enli&s;t;</HI> and ac|cordingly waited on the wor&s;hip|ful <HI>Stentor</HI> above-mentioned, who took down my name and place of abode. On my de&s;iring him, at the &s;ame time, to acquaint me
<PB N="171" REF="168">with the be&s;t method of proceed|ing, which I was an utter &s;tranger to, he advi&s;ed me, as a <HI>friend,</HI> to apply, as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;ible, to Mr. <HI>Bluemould,</HI> a chee&s;emonger in <HI>Rotten Lane,</HI> who was then fir&s;t church-warden, a leading man in the ve&s;try, and a per&s;on, he a&s;&s;ured me, on whom the electi|on would, in a great mea&s;ure, de|pend. I took hone&s;t <HI>Amen's</HI> ad|vice, and by nine the next morn|ing (not, I mu&s;t own, without &s;ome reluctance), dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf as well as I could, and waited on Mr. Churchwarden. As &s;oon as he &s;aw me enter the &s;hop in my canonicals (for I had hired an ex|cellent
<PB N="172" REF="169">new gown and ca&s;&s;ock, be|hind St. Clement's, on the occa|&s;ion) he made me a low bow, gave me the title of <HI>Doctor,</HI> and, imagining, no doubt, that I was come to be&s;peak chee&s;es for the country, begged to know my <HI>ho|nour's</HI> commands; to which I re|plied, in an humble tone, and looking extremely di&s;concerted, that I came to wait on him on account of the lecture&s;hip of the pari&s;h, and begged the favour of his vote and intere&s;t. You would have &s;miled to have &s;een the &s;ud|den alteration of his features and behaviour: he dropped all the trade&s;man's ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s, and
<PB N="173" REF="170">in a moment a&s;&s;umed the magi&s;|terial air and dignity of the churchwarden; turned a&s;ide to a woman who was ju&s;t then a&s;king for a pound of Che&s;hire chee&s;e, and, without addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me, cried out, 'This is the fourth par&s;on I have had with me to-day upon the &s;ame errand;' then &s;taring me full in the face, Well, young man,' &s;ays he, 'you intend to be a candidate for this &s;ame lecture; you are all to mount the <HI>no&s;trum</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e, and merit will carry it; for my part, I pro|mi&s;e nobody; but remember, I tell you before hand, I am for <HI>voice</HI> and <HI>action,</HI> &s;o mind your hits.'
<PB N="174" REF="171">When he had &s;aid this, he im|mediately turned upon his heel, and went into the counting-hou&s;e. I took my leave in an awkward manner, as you may &s;uppo&s;e, be|ing not a little chagrined at his in&s;olence, and as I went out of the &s;hop, overheard his lady ob|&s;erving, from behind the counter, that I was a pretty <HI>&s;prig of divini|ty,</HI> but looked a little <HI>&s;heepi&s;h,</HI> and had not half the courage of the gentleman that had been recom|mended to her hu&s;band by Mr. <HI>Squintum.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THESE are &s;ome of the morti|fications lectures are &s;ubject to;
<PB N="175" REF="172">and then as to their pay, and the manner in which they are paid, it adds &s;till further to the contempt they lie under. The church-ward|ens of a pari&s;h once waited on a quaker, a tin-man within their limits, with the lecturer's book, and &s;olicited his contribution towards the &s;upport of the afternoon &s;er|mon. "Thou knowe&s;t, friend," &s;ays he, <Q>that we give nothing to thy clergy.</Q> 'I admit that,' returns one of the church-wardens, <Q>but he is a worthy gentleman, and a good preacher, and you would &s;ay &s;o if you heard him; I hope, therefore, as our pari&s;h is &s;mall, and we cannot make up
<PB N="176" REF="173">any great &s;um, that you will add to it for the &s;ake of your neigh|bours.</Q> The quaker repeated his words as before, and they were leaving his &s;hop when he called them back, with <Q>Hark'ye, friend; though I told thee we quakers never give any thing towards the &s;upport of thy clergy, yet, as mayhap he may want <HI>light,</HI>&mdash;I'll gee'un a <HI>lantern.</HI></Q></P>
<P>"The lecturer's box," continues my friend, <Q>generally goes about with the re&s;t of the pari&s;h beggars, a little before Chri&s;tmas, and every body throws in their charity (for it is always con&s;idered in that light)
<PB N="177" REF="174">as they think proper. Were I to mention how many paltry excu&s;es are made to evade this little annu|al tribute, by the mean and &s;or|did; how very little is given even by the mo&s;t generous, and what an incon&s;iderable &s;um the whole generally amounts to, the recital would not afford my readers much entertainment, and for aught I know, might give them &s;ome real concern.</Q> A lecturer, 'tis true, is licen&s;ed by the bi&s;hop, and of cour&s;e cannot be removed; but notwith&s;tanding this, he is far from independent: if he &s;hews any marks of di&s;plea&s;ure, or does not plea&s;e his congregation, he feels
<PB N="178" REF="175">it at the next collection; and when they are tired of him, they with|hold their &s;ub&s;criptions, and (as they call it) &s;tarve him out.</P>
<P>"You cannot imagine" proceeds my friend, <Q>with what an envious eye we poor lecturers have often looked over a waiter's book at a coffee-hou&s;e, where I have &s;een &s;uch a collection of <HI>guineas</HI> and <HI>half-guineas,</HI> as made my mouth water. To give le&s;s than a crown would be to the la&s;t degree un|genteel, for the immen&s;e trouble of handing a di&s;h of coffee, or a new&s;paper; whil&s;t the poor di|vine, who has toiled in the mi|ni&s;try
<PB N="179" REF="176">for a twelvemonth, and half worn out a pair of excellent lungs in the unprofitable &s;ervice, &s;hall think him&s;elf well rewarded with the noble donation of <HI>half a crown.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>I know a little too much of the world, to expect that a par|&s;on &s;hould be paid like a fir&s;t-rate player, a pimp, or a lord of the trea&s;ury, who&s;e incomes I believe are nearly equal, but I cannot help thinking, that a <HI>labourer in the vineyard</HI> is as well worthy his hire, as a journeyman carpenter or ma&s;on, and has as good a right to two pound two, on a <HI>Sunday,</HI>
<PB N="180" REF="177">as they have on a Saturday night; and yet not one in an hundred is paid in that proportion.</Q></P>
<P><Q>To illu&s;trate my &s;ubject, I will give my readers another &s;tory; there is nothing like a little painting from the life on the&s;e occa&s;ions.

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS now once more ma&s;ter of my&s;elf, and had an employment to &s;eek; but was very low in ca&s;h, &s;o low, that I could not remain long out of place. I had recour&s;e again to the new&s;papers, and applied as the fol|lowing adverti&s;ement directed me: <Q>Wanted a &s;mart young man as footman to a lady.</Q> She lived
<PB N="186" REF="183">in a well-furni&s;hed hou&s;e, in a gen|teel &s;treet at the we&s;t end of the town; I went in the morning, and was introduced to her whil&s;t at her breakfa&s;t. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> I was pretty well dre&s;&s;ed, and came into the room perhaps in a manner different from what footmen in general do, &s;he ro&s;e from her &s;eat, and when I told her I waited on her in con&s;equence of her adverti&s;ement, &s;he &s;eemed ra|ther confu&s;ed, and &s;aid, <Q>She pre|&s;umed, that either I did not ap|ply for my&s;elf, or that her place would be below my acceptance, for that <HI>her</HI> &s;ervant mu&s;t wear a livery.</Q> I told her, <Q>an overthrow in life had humbled
<PB N="187" REF="184">my mind, and reconciled it to any &s;ituation that was not di&s;ho|ne&s;t or laborious, and that as to wearing the livery of a lady, it was what my &s;uperiors would be proud of.</Q> She &s;eemed to &s;mile at my an&s;wer, and doubt my &s;in|cerity, and <Q>freely acknowledged that my manner and language would do credit to a gentleman.</Q> She a&s;ked me if I had ever lived in the capacity of a &s;ervant? I told her, <Q>I had, and &s;hould be happy to be her's.</Q> A very few words further pa&s;&s;ed between us, &s;he con|de&s;cended to &s;ay, <Q>She was &s;o plea&s;ed with my appearance that &s;he &s;hould inquire no further a|bout
<PB N="188" REF="185">me, I carried too much ho|ne&s;ty in my face to need any other recommendation.</Q> She &s;aid, <Q>&s;he had engaged a &s;ervant, but that &s;he would put him off, and take me in his &s;tead; that her place was not a fatiguing one, it was little more than to wait upon her&s;elf, and that if I would accept of it with eighteen guineas a year, and a live|ry, I might come as &s;oon as I plea&s;|ed.</Q> I bowed an a&s;&s;ent, and told her, <Q>I would attend her the Monday following.</Q> She gave me a di|rection to her taylor, in order to get a new livery, and de&s;ired I would make my fir&s;t appearance in it.&mdash; The livery was white, faced and lin|ed
<PB N="189" REF="186">with pale blue, &s;ilver buttons and epaulet, with a wai&s;tcoat of the co|lour of the facings, laced with &s;il|ver, blue plu&s;h breeches, and &s;ilver laced hat; and the taylor having made it &s;mart, and to fit me exact|ly, paid me the compliment to &s;ay, that <Q><HI>I</HI> rather graced the livery, than the livery <HI>me,</HI> and among all the &s;ervants he had dre&s;&s;ed, he had never &s;een one that became his cloaths &s;o well.</Q> It is rather an awkward ta&s;k to be under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ounding one's own prai&s;e, but as the reader can hear nothing of one who writes his own life, but from the mouth of him who guides the pen, and as he may
<PB N="190" REF="187">wi&s;h to have &s;ome little de&s;cription of my per&s;on, the following is the &s;imple&s;t account I can give. I was, at the time I am now &s;peaking of, a &s;trait well-made man, five feet nine inches high, of a middling &s;ize, neither too corpulent nor too thin, ju&s;t turned of twenty, dark hair, and a great deal of it, had a good &s;et of teeth, and if gla&s;&s;es told truth, a &s;peaking countenance, and a penetrating eye. I was given to under&s;tand, that I had a graceful fi|gure, an in&s;inuating addre&s;s, and the manner of a gentleman; with the&s;e perfections and accompli&s;h|ments, and the education I had re|ceived, with a good flow of &s;pirits,
<PB N="191" REF="188">and &s;anguine health, it mu&s;t have been wonderful had I not pu&s;hed on through life as well as I have done. I mu&s;t own that whenever I fell, it was through the impetuo&s;ity of pa&s;|&s;ions, the heedle&s;&s;ne&s;s of youth, or want of worldly knowledge. I &s;et out with very few expectations, and fewer friends; but I had philo&s;ophy enough to acquire a certain degree of fortitude, and was determined to be a co&s;mopolite, and take the world as it goes.</P>
<P>HAVING arranged my little mat|ters at the hou&s;e where I lodged, I dre&s;&s;ed my hair in the mo&s;t fa&s;hion|able manner, which from cu&s;tom I was expert at, put on a ruffled &s;hirt,
<PB N="192" REF="189">&s;ilk &s;tockings, and a pair of Artois buckles; and when I &s;urveyed my&s;elf in the gla&s;s, dre&s;&s;ed as I was in my new cloaths, I thought my&s;elf a complete coxcomb: however, as I flattered my&s;elf, from the livery my mi&s;tre&s;s gave, and her being plea&s;ed with my appearance, &s;he would not like me the wor&s;e for that; I &s;ent my trunk to her hou&s;e by a porter on the Monday I had promi&s;ed to go, and followed it &s;oon after my&s;elf.</P>
<P>MY lady was a woman about forty years of age, that &s;eemed to have been hand&s;ome in her youth; her figure was rather <HI>em bon point,</HI>
<PB N="193" REF="190">and &s;he pa&s;&s;ed for a widow under the name of Duplex. On my coming to her hou&s;e, &s;he &s;ent for me up &s;tairs, and I could perceive, was not a little plea&s;ed with the fi|gure I made. She told me that I became my livery exceedingly well, that &s;he kept a boy to clean &s;hoes and knives, and that all &s;he expect|ed of me, was to wait at table, and attend upon <HI>her.</HI> Having in|quired my name, "Gabriel," &s;ays &s;he, <Q>you &s;eem to be a young man of uncommon good &s;en&s;e, I pre&s;ume I need not tell you, that &s;ervants &s;hould carry nothing out of the families they live with, nor &s;ee any thing they ought
<PB N="194" REF="191">not to &s;ee. If you attend to this, and are indu&s;trious and civil, you will find me exceedingly good to you.</Q></P>
<P>I HAD not been a fortnight in this hou&s;e before I di&s;covered that my mi&s;tre&s;s was one of tho&s;e conve|nient <HI>obliging</HI> women, who admi|ni&s;tered to the plea&s;ures of others. She was not, is the true &s;en&s;e of the word, a procure&s;s, nor did &s;he keep ladies of ea&s;y virtue under the roof with her; but her hou&s;e was rather in the &s;tile of a private bag|nio, where men of fortune might find an a&s;ylum with their ladies, for an hour, a night, or a week, as it
<PB N="195" REF="192">&s;uited them. She had not the lea&s;t conception of my finding this out, the parties that came, having always pa&s;&s;ed for her friends, and my fel|low-&s;ervants, who had not <HI>my</HI> pe|netration, were kept in the dark. I might, if I plea&s;ed, have conti|nued long in the &s;ervice of this wo|man, had not an event taken place which gave birth to a variety of fu|ture embarra&s;&s;ments in the cour&s;e of my life. My mi&s;tre&s;s was particular|ly kind to me, and would familiarly conver&s;e with me all the time I was waiting on her. She took &s;ome pains to draw me a&s;ide from the narrow path of rectitude, and gave me many broad hints of the favours
<PB N="196" REF="193">&s;he had in &s;tore for me. She would frequently ring the bell and call me to her toilet, even before &s;he had well adju&s;ted her dre&s;s; a&s;k my opinion of female beauty, and often de&s;ire me to tell her, whether her hand|kerchief was put on to advantage. "Gabriel," &s;ays &s;he one day to me, leering under her hat,&mdash; <Q>You can|not have been in many places; pretty young fellows like you, are &s;oon taken out of &s;ervitude. You &s;han't wear a livery long, but &s;hall be groom of my bed|chamber.</Q>&mdash;<Q>What &s;ay you Ga|briel? Should you like &s;uch an office?</Q>&mdash;I plainly &s;aw at what &s;he directed her artillery; but &s;he
<PB N="197" REF="194">was a woman that did not plea&s;e me, and I will be hone&s;t enough to own, that aver&s;ion had more weight with me than principle. She was at all times very inqui&s;itive about my family and connexions, and was very importunate to know where I acquired tho&s;e accompli&s;hments, &s;he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; but, as I did not mean to continue lon|ger with her than I could help, I was re&s;erved in my an&s;wers, and re&s;pectful, though very di&s;tant, in my replies. <Q>She told me, &s;he ex|pected a young lady from the country in a day or two, to be with her &s;ome time; that a fami|ly difference would oblige her to
<PB N="198" REF="195">leave home, and that her being with her was to be a &s;ecret; of cour&s;e, if I could keep a clo&s;e mouth, I &s;hould be amply re|warded; and that I was by no means to communicate to my fel|low-&s;ervants, any thing I might hear or &s;ee above &s;tairs.</Q> I re|plied, <Q>that &s;he might rely on my fidelity,</Q> with which &s;he &s;eemed &s;atisfied. I was the more di&s;plea&s;ed with my mi&s;tre&s;s, as I conceived her to be of a profe&s;&s;ion, the mo&s;t de|&s;tructive to female virtue, and the greate&s;t bane to dome&s;tic happine&s;s of any exi&s;ting. The pride of many an hone&s;t family had been over|thrown, I under&s;tood, by her; and
<PB N="199" REF="196">many a virtuous girl had owed her ruin to her officiou&s;ne&s;s. That there are many of her &s;tamp in the great metropolis is too evident to be doubted, and that they are not made public examples of, is very much to be lamented! The young lady my mi&s;tre&s;s mentioned, was brought to our hou&s;e one morning, by a gentleman in a hackney coach. She appeared to be about &s;eventeen, and was one of the prettie&s;t young women, I think, I ever beheld; with &s;uch a &s;weetne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion and &s;uch a virgin mode&s;ty about her, as attracted all my attention, and made me in&s;tantly conceive &s;omething treacherous in her &s;tory. The gen|tleman
<PB N="200" REF="197">that accompanied her, &s;eem|ed to be a man of fa&s;hion about thirty years of age, and I could &s;ee, that on his introducing her to my mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;he had never &s;een her be|fore. The affair appeared to me my&s;terious, I felt my&s;elf, &s;ome how or other intere&s;ted in her cau&s;e, and was determined, if &s;he was incauti|ou&s;ly &s;educed into this hou&s;e, to watch her virtue with as much care and a&s;&s;iduity, as if &s;he had been my &s;i&s;ter. The gentleman dined with her, &s;taid the greate&s;t part of the day, but left her in the evening. He continued his vi&s;its, in like man|ner, the next day and the day after, and during the times I was waiting
<PB N="201" REF="198">on them, I could di&s;cover nothing more than that indu&s;trious atten|tion, which polite men generally pay to the object of their affections. She &s;eemed to take a more than common notice of me, and ob&s;erved to my mi&s;tre&s;s, which I overheard, when in the next room, that &s;he was per&s;uaded from my manner, that I mu&s;t have been brought up a gentleman. Things went on pret|ty &s;mooth for two or three days, when my mi&s;tre&s;s took an oppor|tunity to go out, and left them to them&s;elves. They drank tea alone, and I waited at tea, and nothing happened to increa&s;e my &s;u&s;picions till about nine in the evening, when
<PB N="202" REF="199">I heard a clattering of the chairs, and their voices rather louder than ordinary. This put me upon the watch, and pre&s;ently I heard her &s;cream with all her powers. I in|&s;tantly flew up &s;tairs, darted into the room, and found her fainting on the &s;opha, and he in a &s;ituation better conceived than de&s;cribed, but very declaratory of his wicked in|tentions. On &s;eeing me enter the room, he &s;eized me by the collar, with <Q>Ra&s;cal, who &s;ent for <HI>you?</HI> Get out of the room this in&s;tant or I'll be the death of you;</Q> catching hold of his &s;word, which he drew. <Q>I told him the lady &s;eemed to need protection, and I
<PB N="203" REF="200">would defend her with my life.</Q> The poor young creature, that mo|ment recovering her &s;en&s;es, begged of me, <Q>for God's &s;ake, to continue with her, and &s;ave her from ruin.</Q> The gentleman, on the other hand, in the utmo&s;t rage and pu&s;hing me from him, in&s;i&s;ted on my leaving the room or he'd run me through the body; and finding me determin|ed not to obey his injunctions, un|armed as I was, he made a lunge at me, which having parried with my hand, I clo&s;ed in upon him and di&s;armed him. The young lady &s;creamed and fainted again, and her ravi&s;her took up his hat, hurried down &s;tairs, and made the be&s;t of
<PB N="204" REF="201">his way out of the hou&s;e. He was no &s;ooner gone, than I a&s;&s;i&s;ted her with &s;ome hart&s;horn, which I found on the mantle-piece, and brought her to her &s;peech. Seeing her&s;elf free from her violator, &s;he called me, her deliverer, thanked me, in the warme&s;t terms, for &s;tanding forth in her defence, and hoped I was not hurt; for when &s;he &s;aw him draw his &s;word, &s;he expected no|thing le&s;s than my murder. I told her I was no way hurt but to &s;ee her &s;o ill-treated, that he had en|deavoured to run his &s;word through me, but, that from &s;ome know|ledge I had of the u&s;e of that weapon, I had e&s;caped the threat|ened
<PB N="205" REF="202">mi&s;chief, and had di&s;armed him; that he had left me in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of his &s;word and was gone, and that I e&s;teemed my&s;elf &s;ingularly happy in having been her protector. She ro&s;e from the &s;opha, walked acro&s;s the room to a chair, and beg|ged me by no means to leave her, but to &s;it down and concert &s;ome means with her, of getting her out of that hou&s;e, which, from many circum&s;tances &s;he &s;u&s;pected to be of no reputation. <Q>She told me, that &s;he was the daughter of a private gentleman of good family and for|tune, that her name was Wildman, that the per&s;on who had &s;o treated her, was a man of rank who had &s;o|licited
<PB N="206" REF="203">her hand in marriage; but his father being alive, and he not being able to make a &s;ufficient &s;et|tlement on her, her father had op|po&s;ed the match; that this gentle|man, however, having gained her affections, &s;he had been &s;o impru|dent as to leave her home, and come here with him, as into the hou&s;e of a friend; where they were privately to be married and wait the reconciliation of her father; that under a variety of frivolous pretences he had delayed the cere|mony and &s;he now &s;aw the drift of his ba&s;e intentions; that his conduct had at once obliterated every &s;park of her attachment, and that, if
<PB N="207" REF="204">po&s;&s;ible, &s;he now hated him more than ever &s;he loved him.</Q> This be|ing her &s;tory, <Q>&s;he a&s;ked me what I thought &s;he had be&s;t do?</Q> <Q>I told her frankly, that I thought the &s;ooner &s;he was out of this hou&s;e the better, for rea&s;ons, if &s;he plea&s;ed, I would hereafter give her; that as &s;he &s;eemed deter|mined not to pur&s;ue the motives that led her to leave her father's hou&s;e, namely, that of giving her hand to a man who had &s;uch de&s;igning views upon her honour, I would by all means advi&s;e her to return, acknowledge her in|di&s;cretion to her father, and as he would now, from what had
<PB N="208" REF="205">pa&s;&s;ed, have no rea&s;on to dread her elopement with the &s;ame per&s;on in future, I flattered my&s;elf he would readily forgive her.</Q> This ad|vice &s;he immediately clo&s;ed with, and was anxious to leave the hou&s;e before my mi&s;tre&s;s return|ed; I encouraged the &s;tep, told her, <Q>if &s;he thought proper, I would fetch a coach from the &s;tand, at the end of the &s;treet, and attend her home.</Q> She a|greed to this; I called a coach, handed her into it, in the pre&s;ence of two of the maid-&s;ervants who were &s;tanding in the pa&s;&s;age, and hav|ing privately told the coachman, to drive to Berkley-&s;quare where her
<PB N="209" REF="206">father lived; I got up behind and the coach drove from the door.</P>
<P>WHEN we were got two or three &s;treets length from the hou&s;e, &s;he &s;topped the coach, and begged to &s;peak to me. It was to direct me to knock but a &s;ingle rap at the door, and to tell the &s;ervant that opened it, that &s;he wi&s;hed her fa|ther not to know of her return, till &s;he had &s;een her mother. When we reached the hou&s;e, I obeyed her directions; &s;he parted with me at the door, but de&s;ired me not to &s;ay who &s;he was, nor where I had left her; and if I could get out in the morning, that I would be with her
<PB N="210" REF="207">between eleven and twelve. On my return home I found my mi&s;|tre&s;s was above, and that &s;he was extremely angry with the &s;teps I had taken. As &s;oon as &s;he heard I was in the hou&s;e, the bell was rung, and I appeared before her. "Gabriel," &s;ays &s;he, with warmth, <Q>what is this you have done?&mdash; Where have you left Mi&s;s?</Q> I gave her a particular account of every thing that I knew had happened in her ab&s;ence; and as I had determined to quit her &s;ervice, I gave her to under&s;tand, that &s;he had a great deal to an|&s;wer for; that from the &s;tory &s;he had told me, prior to the young
<PB N="211" REF="208">lady's coming to her hou&s;e, I was convinced that &s;he was privy to the &s;cheme laid for her de&s;truction, and that I e&s;teemed my&s;elf particularly fortunate in being the cau&s;e of its prevention. <Q>Where have you carried her to?</Q> &s;ays &s;he.&mdash;<Q>That Ma'am,</Q> replied I, <Q>I am not at liberty to divulge; &s;he is, I tru&s;t, in &s;afe hands, and out of the way of any &s;imilar danger.</Q> <Q>Harkye, Gabriel,</Q> &s;ays &s;he, <Q>you may po&s;&s;ibly think your&s;elf ex|ceedingly clever, but I mu&s;t tell you that you are a very impudent fellow, to take any &s;uch liberties in a hou&s;e where you are only a &s;ervant. But I de&s;erve it, in tak|ing
<PB N="212" REF="209">you without a character; the only thing that vexes me is, that I &s;hould have been at any ex|pence for &s;o worthle&s;s a &s;coun|drel. However, &s;trip and turn out, you &s;hall not lay another night under my roof.</Q> <Q>Ma|dam,</Q> replied I, <Q>was you to reflect a moment, you would be careful not to irritate one that has you &s;o much in his power; if it was not for the means it has afforded me of re&s;cuing a deluded young lady from the violence of a ravi&s;her, I &s;hould regret the hour of coming with|in your doors; as it is, Madam, I e&s;teem my&s;elf happy in hav|ing
<PB N="213" REF="210">entered your &s;ervice, and &s;hall think my&s;elf equally &s;o, in quitting it. I am directed to a&s;k you for the &s;mall trunk be|longing to the lady, which if you think proper to deliver, it may &s;ave a further enquiry into your conduct, and I &s;hall then leave <HI>your</HI> cloaths and take my own.</Q> <Q>Oh! I might have it,</Q> &s;he &s;aid, <Q>She wanted nothing belonging to the minx, nor ever de&s;ired to hear of either of us again!</Q> Accordingly having got her trunk, I called a coach, put off her finery, dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf in my own cloaths, took leave of my fellow-&s;ervants and made the be&s;t of my way to my
<PB N="214" REF="211">former lodging, where, though late at night, I found an admi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE next morning I waited on Mi&s;s Wildman, at the appointed time, who, appearing in a morning dre&s;s, &s;eemed lovely in the extreme; and I had the plea&s;ure to receive, from her angelic tongue, her grateful thanks, for her miraculous pre&s;erva|tion. She told me, &s;he was <Q>&s;till more obliged to me for the advice I had given her, which had re|conciled her to the be&s;t of pa|rents, and without which &s;he &s;hould have forfeited that love &s;he never was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of till now. She a&s;ked me "what re|ception
<PB N="215" REF="212">I had met with from my mi&s;tre&s;s on my return?"</Q> I re|lated every particular, and told her <Q>I had brought away her trunk: and though I had lo&s;t my place, I did not fear getting another, having done no otherwi&s;e than as ju&s;tice and duty had compelled me.</Q> She gave me to under&s;tand that <Q>her father wi&s;hed to &s;ee me, and begged I would &s;tay in the &s;er|vants hall, till he had an opportu|ity of &s;peaking with me.</Q> I was no &s;ooner at liberty, but the &s;er|vants flocked about me, and thanked me by their looks, as well as words, for re&s;toring to them their lo&s;t young lady; they told me how much &s;he
<PB N="216" REF="213">was beloved by the whole family and how much they feared their ma&s;ter would never more have received her; but they were joyfully di&s;ap|pointed; that her contrition for her conduct, had wrought her recon|ciliation &s;o effectually, that they believed her father and mother loved her now more affectionately than ever.</P>
<P>Mr. Wildman &s;oon &s;ent for me up, and with tears in his eyes, thanked me for having been the deliverer of his child; he &s;aid, <Q>&s;he had &s;een, he believed, her indi&s;|cretion, had repented of her con|duct, and of cour&s;e, was more
<PB N="217" REF="214">endeared to him than ever:</Q> he told me, <Q>&s;he had acquainted him with &s;o much of the &s;tory, as her &s;en&s;es permitted her to be witne&s;s of; and he would be glad to hear the remainder from <HI>me.</HI></Q> I relat|ed it to him in the manner it hap|pened, and when I had fini&s;hed the tale, he, with a degree of enraptur|ed enthu&s;ia&s;m, flew to me and em|braced me; blubbered out the &s;en|timents of a grateful heart for the kindne&s;s I had done both him and her, and a&s;&s;ured me he would be a friend to me for ever. <Q>There was a gallantry,</Q> he &s;aid, <Q>and greatne&s;s in my conduct, that would do honour to the fir&s;t of
<PB N="218" REF="215">characters, and as he heard I had lo&s;t my place in the cau&s;e, he would take me into his &s;ervice, and I &s;hould be immediately about his per&s;on.</Q> He put into my hand a fifty pound bank-note and told me he would give me one every year, whil&s;t I thought proper to continue with him. Poor as I was, I mode&s;tly refu&s;ed the note, &s;aying, <Q>I was amply gratified in having merited his good wi&s;hes and his daughter's:</Q> but he replied, <Q>fifty pounds he hoped would not hurt me,</Q> and in&s;i&s;ted on my taking it. He then told me, he could employ his pre&s;ent va|let, at an e&s;tate he had in the
<PB N="219" REF="216">country, and I might come to him when I thought proper; I accepted his propo&s;al, and repli|ed, that, <Q>if agreeable to him, I would attend him the next day.</Q> Matters being thus adju&s;ted, I re|turned to my lodging, and prepared to removemy little baggage the next morning; but curio&s;ity leading me to enquire at Mrs. Duplex's, whether the gentleman had called or &s;ent for his &s;word, or whether my fel|low-&s;ervants had heard their mi&s;|tre&s;s &s;ay any thing concerning me, I called there in the evening, under a pretence of returning a cork-&s;crew I had inadvertently taken away in my pocket, and was admitted privately into the kitchen; where I was &s;oon
<PB N="220" REF="217">told, that the gentleman had been there for his &s;word, and that both he and my mi&s;tre&s;s had vowed ven|geance again&s;t me, whenever they could find me. I &s;miled at their me|naces and left the hou&s;e as &s;ecretly as I entered it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP VIII.</HEAD>
<P>THE next day put me in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of my new place, to which I was the more eager to go, as it would give me an opportunity of occa&s;ionally &s;eeing Mi&s;s Wildman, an attachment to whom, I found, <HI>maugre</HI> the great di&s;tance between us, grew in&s;en&s;ibly upon me; and dangerous and fruitle&s;s as the thought might be, I could not but
<PB N="222" REF="219">indulge it. I called to my remem|brance, that, in the cour&s;e of my reading, far more unlikely things had come to pa&s;s than what I coveted. She had now no <HI>penchant</HI> for any man; the late object of her affecti|ons, from his villainous conduct, was become odious to her; &s;he had no|ticed me, even before the late ac|cident happened, in a very favour|able light;&mdash;&s;he &s;eemed endowed with an uncommon &s;hare of &s;en&s;ibi|lity:&mdash;&s;he owed me attention&mdash;&s;he owed me <HI>gratitude;</HI>&mdash;and &s;he called me her pr&ograve;tector and deliverer.&mdash; On the other hand,&mdash;I was con&s;ci|ous in having been bred up a gen|tleman&mdash;of having had a liberal edu|cation
<PB N="223" REF="220">&mdash;of having good connexions and being allied to a good family and fortune; for my father's uncle, though he would do nothing for me, was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an e&s;tate of four thou&s;and pounds a year, and there were only two per&s;ons, the children of my father's elder brother, between me and that e&s;tate, and the&s;e per|&s;ons unmarried.&mdash;With &s;uch chi|merical, &s;uch fugitive notions, did I now and then amu&s;e my&s;elf. I was determined, however, not to offend the family I was in; but to watch and wait patiently for that critical moment, if ever it &s;hould arrive, that might give a more favourable turn to my preten&s;ions. Our family
<PB N="224" REF="221">con&s;i&s;ted of my ma&s;ter, my mi&s;tre&s;s, and their daughter, who were Ro|man Catholics, and of a great num-of &s;ervants; and it &s;eemed a very happy one, when I fir&s;t became a part of it; but, as I was a favour|ite up &s;tairs, I &s;oon became obnoxi|ous below. I &s;tudied, all I could, to conciliate the affections of my fellow-&s;ervants, but that demon Jea|lou&s;y, which &s;eldom takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the human mind, but it makes it &s;ee things through a fal&s;e medi|um, and gives a different colour to tran&s;actions, than what they natur|ally bear; this jealou&s;y poi&s;oned all their tempers, and every thing they did for me was more than I de&s;erv|ed:
<PB N="225" REF="222">my &s;hoes and buckles were not half cleaned; the knife I was to eat with did not cut; the bread I was helped to, was dry; the bear flat, and as I was generally attending upon my ma&s;ter, at the u&s;ual time of breakfa&s;t, in the hou&s;e-keeper's room; when I came down to eat mine, the muffins were gone, the water was cold, and the cream was &s;lopped. In &s;hort, there &s;eemed to be a con&s;pir|acy again&s;t me, and for no fault of mine that I was con&s;cious of; I was too much of a gentleman for a &s;er|vant; I wanted two or three to wait upon me, and I &s;tudied nothing but dre&s;s, affected airs and fine language. &mdash;I bore all this very patiently, for
<PB N="226" REF="223">what will not a per&s;on bear with a favourite object in view? I imput|ed their conduct to ignorance and low-breeding, and prided my&s;elf in returning good for evil. My ma&s;ter, who ufed always to conver&s;e with me, when I was dre&s;&s;ing, would treat me more as a friend than as a &s;er|vant, and with a degree of concern, would often complain to me of the conduct of his people below; at which times I always took pains to excu&s;e their faults, and explain away their errors; but this availed me but little, they were not &s;en&s;ible of my good wi&s;hes towards them; and hated, me merely becau&s;e I was beloved by their ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s.
<PB N="227" REF="224">All I could do, in the pre&s;ent &s;itu|ation of things, was to make a friend of Mi&s;s Wildman's maid, and which I aimed at for more rea&s;ons than one; as it would facilitate my intercour&s;e with her mi&s;tre&s;s, and &s;he was di&s;po&s;ed to get me my break|fa&s;t, which was my be&s;t meal, in her own room. She was a good-na|tured woman, about thirty years of age, and greatly in her young lady's favour. Through her, I learned that Mi&s;s Wildman had expre&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t regard for me, and wi&s;hed for an opportunity of being of u&s;e to me: &s;he had frequently ob&s;erved to her maid, as &s;he had done to Mrs. Duplex, that I had the manner of a
<PB N="228" REF="225">gentleman, and was &s;ure, though in the &s;ituation of a &s;ervant, I had received a gentleman's educati|on, and that her father and mother were of the &s;ame opinion; for that they had never remarked in any &s;er|vant they had men with, that good &s;en&s;e, that gallantry, that re&s;pect|ful attention, and that in&s;inuating addre&s;s that marked my character; and that &s;he was anxious to know my hi&s;tory. Through this &s;ame channel I made her acquainted with every thing concerning me; of which the reader is too well inform|ed to need a repetition here; and as far as I dared to do, I made Char|lotte under&s;tand, which was the
<PB N="229" REF="226">name of Mi&s;s Wildman's maid, that though I ventured my life in the de|fence of her mi&s;tre&s;s, and was too much her friend, to wi&s;h her in any perilous &s;ituation again, yet I &s;hould rejoice in a &s;econd opportunity of convincing her how much I had her &s;afety at heart. This I fore&s;aw would be carried to Mi&s;s Wildman, for Charlotte had too much of the waiting-maid about her, not to take plea&s;ure in carrying tales backwards and forwards. Had I been butler in the family, I &s;hould have had frequent opportunities of being in her pre&s;ence; but, in the capacity of her father's valet, I &s;eldom could &s;ee her. Now and then &s;he would
<PB N="230" REF="227">come into her maid's room, whil&s;t we were at breakfa&s;t, and &s;it and chat with us. The fir&s;t time I &s;aw her upon this occa&s;ion, I ro&s;e re|&s;pectfully from my &s;eat, at which &s;he &s;eemed hurt. "Gabriel," &s;ays &s;he, <Q>I am much obliged to Char|lotte for her Attention to <HI>you;</HI> any re&s;pect &s;he &s;hews you will be gratefully acknowledged by <HI>me;</HI> for to you I am indebted for every thing.</Q> I humbly told her <Q>&s;he rated my &s;ervices too high; for, independent of any protection due to &s;uffering innocence, &s;uch me|rits as Mi&s;s Wildman could boa&s;t of, laid the &s;tronge&s;t claim to every nece&s;&s;ary interference.</Q> She
<PB N="231" REF="228">told me, <Q>that &s;he frequently came into her maid's room to &s;peak with her; but, if it di&s;turbed me, or put me the lea&s;t out of my way, &s;he would never enter it again: and it was her reque&s;t in future, that I &s;hould not notice her coming in.</Q> I replied, that <Q>as a command of her's, I &s;hould obey it.</Q> At the&s;e occa&s;ional in|terviews, &s;he would be affable and familiar, and once &s;he conde&s;cended to tell me, <Q>that Lord B. who was the &s;on of the Earl of A. and who had treated her &s;o ill, had made &s;everal applications for leave to renew his addre&s;&s;es to her; but &s;he was determined never to
<PB N="232" REF="229">li&s;ten to him more. Her heart,</Q> &s;he &s;aid, <Q>was her own again, and &s;he hoped, &s;he &s;hould have &s;uffi|cient di&s;cernment and re&s;olution never to be&s;tow it more upon a worthle&s;s objects.</Q> <Q>Charlotte,</Q> &s;ays &s;he, <Q>one day, to her maid,</Q> (for Charlotte told it me again) <Q>was I mi&s;tre&s;s of my own fortune, I don't know but I would be&s;tow it upon Gabriel: he appears to be a young man of &s;uch nice ho|nour, and &s;uch virtuous &s;entiments, as would be an ornament to any line of life, he may be thrown into.</Q> <Q>I a&s;&s;ure you, Mi&s;s, &s;ays, Charlotte, it would not be ill be|&s;towed, for Gabriel is the &s;on of
<PB N="233" REF="230">a gentleman, has had the be&s;t of educations, and, though now in the capacity of a &s;ervant, has an e&s;tate of four thou&s;and pounds a year in expectation.</Q> In &s;hort, &s;he made her mi&s;tre&s;s acquainted with many parts of my hi&s;tory, &s;uch as I had let her into.</P>
<P>IT was a practice with me in every &s;cene of life into which I was thrown, to acquire all the information I could, re&s;pecting that &s;cene; here then I learned the fatigue and ab&s;urdity of a fa&s;hionable life, and the tire&s;ome round of di&s;&s;ipation attending it. My ma&s;ter, in one of his conver&s;able mo|ments, told me, there was no &s;ati&s;|faction
<PB N="234" REF="231">in the vi&s;its men of fa&s;hi|on paid to each other, and that he had <HI>cut</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cut</HI> is a fa&s;hionable term for, given it up.</NOTE> it long &s;ince. <Q>Vi&s;its among the great,</Q> he &s;aid, <Q>were merely ceremonial, and rather trouble&s;ome than otherwi&s;e; he had vi&s;ited a man for &s;even years together, and never once had &s;een him.</Q> Indeed, I heard my&s;elf, a gentleman once &s;ay to a lady, who rated him for not calling oftener to &s;ee her, <Q>It is your lady&s;hip's fault entirely.&mdash;I would come oftener, if you would not let me in.</Q> Nay, vi|&s;iting is allowed to be &s;o much a cere|mony, that I have been told of a lady, who, having omitted to tell her por|ter, that &s;he did not chu&s;e to be &s;een,
<PB N="235" REF="232">put her head out of window, and call|ed out to her vi&s;itant, on knocking at the door, "I am not at home." Frequently has my ma&s;ter told me, that in the younger part of his life, he and his lady received &s;o many in|vitations on the &s;ame day, that they have been obliged to divide them|&s;elves, and go from one hou&s;e to an|other, &s;hewing them&s;elves each at two or three places on the &s;ame even|ing; and on my a&s;king whether it would not have been better to have omitted going to more places than one? He replied, <Q>No, nothing but illne&s;s (if in town) is an excu&s;e for non-attendance; if an invit|ation is once or twice unaccepted,
<PB N="236" REF="233">party will be a&s;ked no more,</Q> John, our porter, has entertained me, frequently for a long time together, with vi&s;iting relations. He told me, when ladies have &s;o many vi&s;its to return, that they cannot per&s;onally pay them, it is not an unu&s;ual thing to &s;end the empty chair, which &s;top|ping at the end of the &s;treet, the footman &s;teps forward to the hou&s;e, knocks gently at the door, and a&s;ks the porter confidentially, if his lady &s;ees company; if an&s;wered in the negative, he knocks hard, beckons to the chairmen to come up and leaves a card; if an&s;wered in the affirmative, no notice is taken, but they proceed to another hou&s;e. To
<PB N="237" REF="234">avoid, however, this trouble&s;ome piece of bu&s;ine&s;s; gentlemen will now leave their names at the door, with|out enquiring for the ma&s;ter, or attempting to go in; and ladies will &s;end their &s;ervants to do the &s;ame; and the delivery of &s;uch card &s;hall be con&s;trued as a vi&s;it made and re|turned. And what is all this but farce and tire&s;ome ceremony? the end of vi&s;iting is &s;ocial intercour&s;e and friendly conver&s;e; but this mode of vi&s;iting, de&s;troys that end. A mo|dern vi&s;itant &s;eems to dread the meeting of a private friend, as if he was fearful his conduct &s;hould be en|quired into and cen&s;ured; and, as if he abhorred the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;aying a
<PB N="238" REF="235">civil thing to his acquaintance. Whatever the&s;e people may think, &s;uch conduct is di&s;graceful, and mu&s;t ari&s;e from want of abilities to join in general topics, or from fearing re|flection, as owls fear the day-light.</P>
