<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>_WHEN the Po&s;thumous Pieces of any Author have for &s;ome Years
lain in Ob&s;curity, and at la&s;t come into the World, the Publi&s;her, for
his own Reputation, is obliged to &s;atisfy the Publick, that they are the
genuine Productions of that Pen to which his Title Page pretends to a&s;cribe
them.</P>
<P>THAT the&s;e MEMOIRS may fall un|der no Su&s;picions of being
&s;purious, it is nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould account for <PB REF="4"> their
coming into my Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. When I was la&s;t Year in <HI>Paris,</HI> it
was my good Fortune to contract &s;ome Acquain|tance with a younger Son of Sir
<HI>Richard Bul&s;trode,</HI> who then re&s;ided there, as Governour in the
Family of the young Earl of <HI>Fingal.</HI> I had not long enjoy'd the Honour
of his Conver&s;ation, before he frankly gave me the Copy of the&s;e MEMOIRS,
with free Liberty to make them publick to the World, and a&s;&s;ured me they
were all wrote by the Hand of Sir <HI>Richard</HI> his Father. The Town is
therefore indebted to this Gentleman's Genero&s;ity, and are to look upon me as
an Agent that labours to be faithful in acquitting my &s;elf of a Charge
intru&s;ted to me.</P>
<P>I SHOULD have thought it a nece&s;|&s;ary Piece of Ju&s;tice, to
have made a Character of Sir <HI>Richard Bul&s;trode</HI> a Part of this
Preface, but find all that is re|qui&s;ite on this Head is already done by
<HI>Whitlock Bul&s;trode,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> likewi&s;e a Son of the
Author, and who has obliged the Publick with a Volume of his Father's 
<PB REF="5"> E&s;&s;ays, Printed in <HI>Octavo</HI> in the Year 1715, where the
Reader may be enter|tained with a preliminary Account, how well Sir
<HI>Richard</HI> was qualify'd both for an Author and State&s;man.</P>
<P>IF the&s;e Sheets could &s;tand in need of any other Proof of
their being ge|nuine, than the A&s;&s;ertion I have given from who&s;e Hands I
received them, I could not de&s;ire a &s;tronger concurring Te&s;timony than
tho&s;e E&s;&s;ays. Every Judge, who will do him&s;elf the Plea|&s;ure of a
Compari&s;on, will find both tho&s;e and the MEMOIRS penn'd in the &s;ame
Style, and with the &s;ame Ca&s;t of Thought and Spirit of Language. The
Contents being Matter of Fact, they &s;hould neither be partial, nor of a
Par|ty; yet if &s;ome will think he reflects too &s;everely, let them
con&s;ider he wrote at a Time when Faction and Presbytery had undone his Royal
Ma&s;ter, and left a very poor Pro&s;pect of the Kingdom it &s;elf e&s;caping
from their Rancour.</P>

<HEAD>MEMOIRS OF THE <HI>Reign</HI> and <HI>Government</HI> OF K.
<HI>CHARLES</HI> the I^s^t^.</HEAD>
<P>_IT is natural for all Men, when &s;treightened with Fears, to run
for Shelter to what their Fancy pre&s;ents as an In&s;tru|ment of their Ea&s;e
and Reme|dy; but he that hath Time to deliberate, unle&s;s he places his Hopes
upon &s;omething that is like to ea&s;e his Pain, by making his Afflictions
le&s;s, or his Pa|tience <PB N="2" REF="23" MS="y"> more, de&s;erves that
Mi&s;ery he groans under: But Afflictions which come by God's Appointment,
repre&s;ent the Sadne&s;s of Morta|lity, and become Monuments of Mens Piety and
Devotion. In the unnatural War, which the Subjects of King <HI>Charles</HI> I.
began again&s;t their mo&s;t lawful Sovereign, contrary to all Solemnies of
Chri&s;tianity, and of all that is called Good, I was then very young, and in a
Labyrinth, not knowing well which Way to go; but at la&s;t I re&s;olved to go
to <HI>Whitehall,</HI> with &s;ome Gentlemen of the <HI>Inner-Temple,</HI>
be|ing then newly come thither from <HI>Cambridge,</HI> where I had been bred,
in <HI>Pembroke-Hall.</HI> I was brought up to <HI>London</HI> by my Father,
from <HI>Coventry,</HI> where we then dwelt: We were all brought into the
King's Pre&s;ence by the Lord Chamberlain, and had the Honour to ki&s;s the
King's Hands, who took our Coming very kind|ly, and at the &s;ame time told us,
he hoped he &s;hould have no need of our Service.</P>
<P>About this Time, the King, and the Laws, (who by God and Man
re&s;pectively are appoin|ted the &s;ole Protectors of Innocence and Truth) had
them&s;elves, I thought, the greate&s;t need of a Protector; and when I
con&s;ider'd our King's Ca&s;e, in the Beginning of his Troubles, me-thought it
was much like to that of King <HI>David,</HI> who was vexed with a Civil War,
both by his Son <HI>Ab&s;alom,</HI> and by his own People: But the Ca&s;e of
our King was wor&s;e than that of King <HI>David</HI>; for the Text &s;ays, his
Enemies kept about him <HI>like Bees,</HI> and were extinct; there was 
<PB N="3" REF="24"> &s;ome Honey with them; but our King's Ene|mies came about
him like Hornets, where there was all Sting, and no Honey. And indeed the
King's Ca&s;e was rather like that of <HI>I&s;aac</HI> ready to be
&s;acrificed; the Wood was prepared, the Fire kindled, the Knife was lift up,
and the Hand was &s;triking; and if the King's loyal Sub|jects had not been
&s;omething like <HI>Abraham</HI> too, having, out of Hope, believed in Hope,
we had been as much without Comfort, as we were in outward Appearance without
Remedy. Indeed I then &s;aw &s;uch unparallel'd Revolutions in our
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Monarchy, as I hope will never be imi|tated, and will be
&s;carce credited in After-Ages; whereupon I have thought it worth my Time to
give &s;ome Account of tho&s;e great and &s;trange Tran&s;actions, wherein I
was per&s;onally engag'd, which are &s;till fre&s;h in my Memory, having
faithfully &s;erved King <HI>Charles</HI> I. from the Year 1640, which Civil
War ended not till 1648, in the mo&s;t deplorable Murder of the be&s;t of
Kings, who&s;e Cau&s;e at la&s;t God &s;o owned, and &s;o vindicated his
Honour, that never Prince was more truly lamented, nor his Po&s;terity, by
divine Providence, more wonderfully re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, without the
A&s;&s;i&s;tance of any foreign Power, tho' his rebellious Subjects u&s;ed all
po&s;&s;ible Diligence, (which either Wit or Malice could invent) to extirpate
the Royal Family, both Root and Branch.</P>
<P>I pre&s;ume, the Duty of my publick Employ|ments abroad, under
King <HI>Charles</HI> II. and King <HI>James</HI> II. will in &s;ome Mea&s;ure
plead my Excu&s;e <PB N="4" REF="25"> for giving &s;ome Relations of the War of
King <HI>Charles</HI> I. which have not yet been mention'd, and of tho&s;e
&s;udden Changes, and violent Re|volutions happen'd in the la&s;t Age; and
being now grown old to all worldly Plea&s;ures, after many long and faithful
Services to the Crown, and being wholly unacquainted with the Know|ledge of
Riches, or with the Cares of increa&s;ing them, or the Fears of lo&s;ing them,
and finding little Ta&s;te in common Conver&s;ation, I have &s;pent my latter
Years in writing &s;ome Memoirs, Poems, and other Di&s;cour&s;es, to &s;hew
that I have not &s;pent my la&s;t Days in Idlene&s;s and Vanity; and that
&s;ince I can no longer live in an active Life, I may not die an unprofitable
Servant. And yet I have but &s;mall Inclination to write, when the Number of
Scribblers in this la&s;t Age hath given the World a Surfeit, by the
mi&s;chievous Liberty of Writing, where|by great Advantage hath been taken, to
corrupt People with fal&s;e Notions of Government, which hath de&s;troyed
Millions of Men, by engaging them in &s;uch a Rebellion, as no Age or Nation
can equal, under Pretence of Reli|gion and Law: And tho' at fir&s;t it did not
break out into Blood, but was carried on for &s;ome time with Paper
Skirmi&s;hes, yet at la&s;t it grew too &s;trong for both; and according to the
u&s;ual Practice, when any Rebellion was hatch|ing, they that de&s;igned it,
immediately cry'd out, <HI>Hannibal ad Portas,</HI> and that what they did, was
to pre&s;erve their Religion, Laws, Li|berties and Properties, when none of
them were <PB N="5" REF="26"> in Danger; and when they mo&s;t flattered their
Sovereign, and called God to witne&s;s the Purity of their Intentions, even
then they were prepa|ring their Weapons to murder him. And as it is &s;een in
natural Bodies, that Fatne&s;s of Diet doth for the mo&s;t Part lay the
Foundation of Maladies, which cannot be expell'd by the mo&s;t &s;killful
Phy&s;ician, without the U&s;e of &s;ome ex|traordinary Medicines; &s;o, in our
Body Poli|tick, we were ble&s;s'd with long Peace, with Riches and Plenty the
Product of it, and by the propitious Influence of our King, when we thus
flouri&s;hed, we went only to throw away tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed Fruits of Peace,
&s;o that the whole Body Politick was quickly out of Order: And tho' perhaps
there were &s;ome Errors and Irre|gularities in the Government, yet they
pro|ceeded not from any Pravity of Di&s;po&s;ition in the King, nor from any
Principles of Arbitrary Government; it being confe&s;&s;ed by the King's
greate&s;t Enemies, that he was indued with the be&s;t and pure&s;t Morals, of
any Prince that ever held the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Scepter. But his People
thought that &s;ome evil Coun&s;ellours did capti|vate him at their Plea&s;ure,
and did thru&s;t his Maje&s;ty into Actions prejudicial to him&s;elf and the
common Good; upon which they were in|vited by that rebellious Parliament to
take Arms, under the plau&s;ible Shew of Reformation and Liberty, when many of
them, in the Simplici|ty of their Hearts, never had the lea&s;t Intenti|on of
abridging the King of any of his ju&s;t Pre|rogative, but only to re&s;train
&s;ome Exce&s;&s;es in <PB N="6" REF="27"> Government, which they really
thought were the Excre&s;cences of &s;overeign Power, and were rather Burthens
than Ornaments of his royal Diadem. Indeed his very Example would have had a
greater Influence upon his Subjects, than the &s;tricte&s;t Laws. He was &s;o
great a Lover of Ju&s;tice, and &s;o great a Ju&s;ticiar him&s;elf, that no
Temptations could di&s;po&s;e him to a wrongful Action, unle&s;s it were &s;o
di&s;gui&s;ed to him, that he believed it to be ju&s;t; and yet I cannot but
confe&s;s, that a Prince's Fame, in this World, depends more upon his wi&s;e
Admini&s;tration, than upon his private Morality and good Life. The Goodne&s;s
of his Government depends chiefly upon tho&s;e that advi&s;e him, who are to
yield unto their Prince all the Reputation ari|&s;ing from their good
Coun&s;els, and never to in|tercept the Honour of them from the King: It being
an infallible Maxim, That he is not the wor&s;t King, that is the wor&s;t Man,
but he who hath the wor&s;t Coun&s;ellours and In&s;truments under him.</P>
<P>The Laws of <HI>England</HI> making them the on|ly Per&s;ons
obnoxious to be arraigned and puni|&s;hed, being in the King's Confidence, and
in the Head of his Affairs, the&s;e &s;hould have been pitched upon to an&s;wer
criminally for all tho&s;e things which were then called Mi&s;carriages; the
Law having mark'd them out as Offenders, and as Offerings of Attonement for the
King's Faults (were he guilty of any) but in&s;tead of this, the King (whom all
the Laws of the Land, and the Con&s;titution it &s;elf, hold not only
un|puni&s;hable, <PB N="7" REF="28"> but innocent) was elected as the
Scape-Goat, to have the Offences of his Mini|&s;ters, and the &s;ubordinate
Tools of the Govern|ment, tran&s;mitted and laid upon him.</P>
<P>Thus Rebels are never without &s;ome Pretext to palliate their
Actions; and rather than fail, will make their Vizard of Religion, which (if
true) is a Setler, not a Stickler in Government: She confirms Men in Obedience,
and does not en|courage them in Rebellion. It is a great Mi|&s;take indeed, to
think Peace is well enough pre&s;erved, if the Sword be not drawn, and think it
not War, becau&s;e we do not take the Field; whereas, we may as well call it
Health, when there is a dangerous Fermentation in the Blood, becau&s;e the
Patient hath not taken his Bed: For certainly, where there is not a firm
Tru&s;t between the King and his People, from a due Obedience to his Laws and
Government, and a &s;teady Care not to remove the ancient Landmarks, not to
di&s;turb tho&s;e Con&s;titutions, which the Wi&s;dom of our Ance&s;tors hath
&s;et|led, in order to pre&s;erve the whole Frame of the Government upon the
old Foundations: When any of the&s;e fail, the Kingdom mu&s;t needs fall into
Confu&s;ion, as was mi&s;erably &s;een in the Time of this unhappy Prince.</P>
<P>But, to find the Beginning of the&s;e Evils, we mu&s;t look back
as far as Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> where we &s;hall di&s;cover the
Presbyterians con|triving what they have &s;ince put in Execution, to the
eternal Scandal of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation. Their Religion hath always
been imperious, <PB N="8" REF="29" MS="y"> turbulent, and bloody, and hath
embroil'd all Places with Rebellion, where it once got Foot|ing, from its
fir&s;t Ri&s;e at <HI>Geneva,</HI> to its Re|move into <HI>France,</HI> from
thence into <HI>Holland,</HI> &s;o into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and from thence to
its Arrival in <HI>England.</HI> They are impatient of any kind of Government;
Theocracy it &s;elf would not plea&s;e them, for they conclude again&s;t all
Governments. From their fir&s;t In&s;titution, they &s;hewed their Hatred
again&s;t Monarchs, and they &s;till glory to have had a principal Part in
mo&s;t of the Commotions of Chri&s;tendom, &s;ince they took up the Work of
Reformation; and by their frequent In&s;urrections in <HI>England,</HI> they
gave the fir&s;t Occa&s;ion of &s;aying, <HI>Rex Angliae, Rex Diabolorum.</HI>
The re&s;t of Schi&s;maticks are but their Spawn; <HI>Calvin</HI> fir&s;t
founded his Pre&s;bytery and Trea&s;on: For when they at <HI>Geneva</HI> had,
in his Ab&s;ence, expell'd their lawful Prince, he not only encourag'd, but
confirm'd what they had done, at his Return. Pre&s;bytery never was received
into any State, where it did not embroil; never any Man was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
with it, whom it did not &s;trangely transform with Moro&s;ene&s;s; all their
Writings are &s;tuff'd with reproachful Language again&s;t the &s;acred
Per&s;ons of Princes, with Dethroning Principles, and King-killing Doctrines,
as may be &s;een in <HI>Calvin</HI>'s <HI>In&s;titutions,</HI> in that of
<HI>Junius Brutus,</HI> in <HI>Vindiciae contra Tyrannos,</HI> written by
<HI>Beza,</HI> and <HI>Knox</HI>'s <HI>Appellation to the People,</HI> and
<HI>Buchanan</HI>'s <HI>Jus Regni apud Scotos,</HI> which he had the Impudence
to dedicate to King <HI>James</HI>; <PB N="9" REF="30"> in which Book, and
others of their Writings, they &s;ay, The People are the Original of all ju&s;t
Power, and that wicked Kings, for their Mi&s;government, may be put to Death by
their Subjects: An impious Principle! ju&s;tly con|demn'd, and fitted only for
the Mouth of a <HI>Ravilliac.</HI> Hi&s;tory tells us, that, in the Reigns of
Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> King <HI>James,</HI> and King <HI>Charles</HI> I. the
Pre&s;byterians were always grum|bling and murmuring again&s;t the Times, their
whole Practice being to deprive God of his Glory, the Prince of his Honour, and
the Peo|ple of their Sen&s;es, affirming the Condition of <HI>England</HI> was
mi&s;erable. In the Beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> the Pul&s;e of the
People began to beat high (by the In&s;tigation of the Pre&s;by|terians)
towards an Ari&s;tocratical Government, under a Kingly Title, and the malicious
Ene|mies of the Church and State did then begin to appear; but that watchful
Queen was &s;oon alar|med, and &s;o a&s;&s;erted her Prerogative, that &s;he
kept all in their Duty: She declared, and pro|te&s;ted publickly, that no
Trouble &s;hould arrive to the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks, for any Difference in
Religion (which did much abate the Oppo&s;ition which might po&s;&s;ibly have
been made by them) hoping for fair Quarter under her Government. She knew well,
that a King or Queen of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> how &s;overeign &s;oever, could not
e&s;tabli&s;h a new Religion in their Kingdom, without the Authority and
Countenance of a Parliament; and therefore, to win the Bi&s;hops, and the
re&s;t of the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks in Parliament, at <PB N="10" REF="31">
lea&s;t to Obedience, &s;he was content to u&s;e Poli|cy with them, and would
qualify the Style of Supreme Head of the Church and State, to that of Supreme
Governour, which, tho' it al|ter'd not the Sen&s;e, yet it abu&s;ed many into a
Belief or Conceit, that the Queen pretended not &s;o much Primacy
Eccle&s;ia&s;tick as the King her Father had done, who was the fir&s;t King of
<HI>England</HI> that ever gave Cau&s;e to try the ad|mirable Patience and
Obedience of his Catho|lick Subjects, who took not Arms again&s;t their
Sovereign, and had no other Weapons but <HI>Praeces &amp; Lachrymae,</HI> the
Prayers and Tears of the Church for their Refuge.</P>
<P>Indeed Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> was &s;o careful, that the
Parliament could make no Impre&s;&s;ion upon her Sovereignty; and tho' the Cry
of Per&s;ecu|tion was pretty loud, and that the Enemies of Church and State
were trouble&s;ome to her, yet, by her con&s;tant Re&s;olution, &s;he was not
over|borne by any Faction; and finding it ea&s;ier to crop them in the Bud,
than to pull them up by the Roots, &s;he took the right Cour&s;e with them, by
putting the Schi&s;maticks under the Statute of Recu&s;ancy, equal with the
<HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks, whereby &s;he quieted All; and often declared in
Parliament, That both Hou&s;es had only Au|thority to advi&s;e and con&s;ent to
what they thought was for the common Good and Benefit of her Subjects: And
wherever the Prince is not jealous of Underminers, and active to pre|&s;erve
the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Government, there will never want Spirits to attempt a
Change, and <PB N="11" REF="32"> make Religion a Shelter for their Rebellion.
It is certain, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have always loved tho&s;e Princes be&s;t,
who grounded their Power in the Affections of their People, who ruled them by
their old Laws, and u&s;ed &s;uch moderate Power, as was con&s;i&s;tent with
their Government, rather than &s;uch as aim'd at any Change, which might tend
to &s;ubvert their ancient Con&s;titution; and &s;eldom any Prince hath
mi&s;carried, who con|&s;tantly pur&s;ued the publick Good, and directed all
his Coun&s;els to his Country's Ea&s;e; but tho&s;e Princes have been full of
di&s;a&s;trous Troubles, who have ob&s;tinately adhered to a Few, again&s;t the
Whole, and have conferred that Affection to particular Per&s;ons, which
&s;hould be exten|ded to the univer&s;al Body of the People.</P>
<P>The Truth is, the Excellency of Queen <HI>Eli|zabeth</HI>'s
Government was, that, at her fir&s;t Coming to the Crown, &s;he found a Council
of able Mini&s;ters (which in the la&s;t Age were not &s;een) which &s;he
continued, who managed the publick Affairs with &s;uch prudent Conduct, that
their Coun&s;els and Actions, as they were either Gown or Sword Men, gave great
Satisfaction, and had great Influence upon the whole Nation. But her
Succe&s;&s;or, King <HI>James,</HI> was not &s;o wary, who came to the Crown
under many Difficulties; for, the Mixture of a Stranger Nation, formerly upon
no good Terms with <HI>England,</HI> the Subjection of it to a Stranger Prince,
who&s;e Nature and Di&s;po&s;ition being unknown, could not but prove of very
ill Con|&s;equence, who let that ill Humour in the Peo|ple 
<PB N="12" REF="33" MS="y"> imbibe &s;o fa&s;t, that it &s;oon bred in them a
violent Contumacy again&s;t the Prerogative: And this King <HI>James</HI>
minding his Plea&s;ures more than his Bu&s;ine&s;s, his Favourites were more
e&s;teemed than his State&s;men; who there|upon permitted his Favourite
<HI>Scotchmen</HI> (coming out of a poor mountainous Country, into a rich Soil)
to make a Harve&s;t of the Crown Reve|nue; and when hand&s;om Mr.
<HI>Villiers</HI> was brought into Favour (for Hand&s;omne&s;s went a great Way
in our Court) he came &s;uddenly to have &s;o prodigious an A&s;cent upon the
King, that he entirely di&s;po&s;ed of all his Favours, and did whatever he
pleas'd.</P>
<P>In the Beginning of this King's Government, the King had no great
Choice of excellent Men; and Mr. <HI>Villiers</HI>'s A&s;cent was &s;o quick,
that it &s;eem'd rather a Flight than a Growth; and he was &s;uch a Darling of
Fortune, as if he had been born a Favourite, being Supreme the fir&s;t Month he
came to Court. However, he was very unfortunate in the Election of his
Depen|dants, few of his Servants being qualified enough to advi&s;e him, and
were intent only of grow|ing rich under him, and not upon their Ma|&s;ter's
being as Good as Great. And if this great Favourite had been &s;o happy as to
have had but one faithful Friend, that Per&s;on might have done great Service
to both his Ma&s;ters, even to Father and Son. In King <HI>James</HI> the
Father's Time, he took the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> into <HI>Spain,</HI>
contrary to the King's Opinion, who yet &s;ubmitted to him; and upon a
particular <PB N="13" REF="34"> Di&s;content of his own, broke the intended
Marriage, and brought back the Prince, to the great Satisfaction both of King
and People; which Action was &s;o highly approved in the la&s;t Parliament of
that King, that the Duke of <HI>Bucks</HI> was called, The Saviour of the
People; and the Earl of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> then Amba&s;&s;ador at
<HI>Madrid,</HI> was recalled, and Articles exhibited again&s;t him by the
Duke, and by his Intere&s;t was kept out of the Hou&s;e of Lords. Now all that
happen'd in <HI>Spain</HI> is here very well worth relating, which I have had
from a very &s;ure Hand, which hath been kept private from many.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> was employ'd Amba&s;&s;ador in
<HI>Spain</HI> by King <HI>James,</HI> to treat of the Marri|age with the then
<HI>Infanta</HI> of <HI>Spain.</HI> The King of <HI>Spain</HI> being zealous
for the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick Religion, in&s;i&s;ted to procure &s;ome
Favours for the <HI>Engli&s;h Roman</HI> Catholicks, which related no farther,
than to a Freedom of Religion for the <HI>Infanta,</HI> her Servants, and the
Children of the Marriage, and her Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks and Reli|gious, which
could not be done, without the King's particular Licence and Di&s;pen&s;ation;
to which the King a&s;&s;ented. But this Affair being longer delayed, the
<HI>Spani&s;h</HI> King urged farther, in Favour of the <HI>Engli&s;h
Roman</HI> Catholicks in general (but the Manner and Way of doing it, was to be
left to his Maje&s;ty's Wi&s;dom:) Where|upon King <HI>James</HI> and Prince
<HI>Charles</HI> both &s;igned; and King <HI>James,</HI> for farther
Satisfaction, did, by the Lord <HI>Conway,</HI> his then Secretary of State,
dated <HI>Aug.</HI> 7. 1623. declare and engage, <PB N="14" REF="35"> That his
&s;aid Maje&s;ty would cau&s;e a pre&s;ent Su&s;pen&s;ion, under the Great Seal
of <HI>England,</HI> of all tho&s;e penal Laws whereunto his <HI>Roman</HI>
Catholick Subjects were before &s;ubject, and under the &s;ame Great Seal would
give a Di&s;pen|&s;ation and Toleration to all his <HI>Roman</HI> Catho|lick
Subjects, as well Prie&s;ts as temporal Per|&s;ons. The Marriage not taking
Effect, and Animo&s;ities happening betwixt the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI>
and the Earl of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> the Earl, before King <HI>James</HI>'s
Death having been impea|ched in Parliament; yet he wrought &s;o with the
Hou&s;e of Commons, as to impeach the Duke, who then prevailed with his
pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, that the Impeachment of the Earl &s;hould be fir&s;t try'd
in the &s;ame Parliament, thereby to cau&s;e the Earl to forbear Pro&s;ecution
of his Charge again&s;t the Duke, or to invalidate his Te&s;timony. One of the
Articles charged again&s;t the Earl of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> was, <HI>That he
coun&s;elled and per&s;waded King</HI> James, <HI>to grant and allow the
Papi&s;ts free Toleration, and &s;ilencing all Laws made again&s;t them.</HI>
But the Earl po&s;itively de|nied this Article, and &s;aid, it was only
decla|red, <HI>That he would di&s;pen&s;e with the Laws, which imported no more
than a Permi&s;&s;ion to ex|erci&s;e their Religion in private Hou&s;es, and to
&s;u&s;pend the Execution of the Laws again&s;t them for a time; all which the
King had Power to do:</HI> But to grant a free Toleration, imports an
Al|lowance of publick Wor&s;hip, and the &s;ilencing all Laws again&s;t them,
might import a total Repeal, <HI>which the King did not claim a Right</HI> 
<PB N="15" REF="36"> <HI>to do him&s;elf.</HI> When the Impeachment was brought
into the Lords Hou&s;e, the Earl of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> did put in his An&s;wer
to it, and po&s;i|tively denied, that he had coun&s;elled any thing in the
Matter charged, and declared fully what was done, and what was &s;igned by the
late King <HI>James,</HI> and King <HI>Charles</HI>; as al&s;o the Decla|ration
made by the Lord <HI>Conway,</HI> by the King's Order; and added, <HI>That the
Duke of</HI> Buckin|gham <HI>being then the greate&s;t Mini&s;ter of State, and
Favourite to King</HI> James, <HI>did advi&s;e all things in the Affair: That
the Lord</HI> Conway <HI>certainly &s;igned the Declaration.</HI> The Earl
wanted neither Wit nor Courage to charge the Duke with Crimes as
di&s;ta&s;teful as he could find any; and he &s;pared not the Lord
<HI>Conway,</HI> who was the Duke's Friend, and mu&s;t have been the be&s;t
Witne&s;s to &s;ave the Duke, in ca&s;e the Charge had been pro&s;ecuted. The
Parliament then &s;it|ting was as diligent to enquire into Mi&s;de|meanours, as
much di&s;plea&s;ed with the Duke, and as little fond of the Lord
<HI>Conway,</HI> then Secretary of State, and were as much enclined to enquire
into the too much advancing or &s;tretching the King's Prerogative, to the
Preju|dice of the Subject, and again&s;t the Laws, as any Parliament which ever
&s;at in <HI>England. Yet neither did the Parliament, or the Earl of</HI>
Bri|&s;tol, <HI>charge any thing again&s;t the Duke, or the Lord</HI> Conway,
<HI>for advi&s;ing to di&s;pen&s;e with Pe|nal Laws, nor did the Parliament
pro&s;ecute the Earl of</HI> Bri&s;tol <HI>upon the Impeachment again&s;t
him,</HI> tho' he was thereby particularly charged <PB N="16" REF="37" MS="y">
for advi&s;ing the King to di&s;pen&s;e with the Penal Laws. <HI>Now, if
King</HI> James <HI>and King</HI> Charles I. <HI>did pa&s;s any Act of
Parliament (as &s;ome affirm) to bar them&s;elves or the Crown of this Right,
the &s;ame could be only intended as to the ordi|nary Exerci&s;e of that
Right,</HI> but not to the ex|traordinary, where the publick Good requires the
&s;ame &s;hould be exerci&s;ed. The King's Pro|ceedings were to be thus
intended, and not otherwi&s;e, which was proved by the King's continual
Exerci&s;e of that Power, in the Su&s;pen|&s;ion of Penal Laws, never
que&s;tioned or com|plained of, but &s;till &s;ubmitted unto, and admit|ted as
legal; <HI>as namely, tho&s;e touching the Im|portation of</HI> French
<HI>Wines:</HI> And it was clear by his Maje&s;ty's Practice for many Years,
that he thought it both rea&s;onable and legal, to con|tinue the
Di&s;pen&s;ations by which his Maje&s;ty &s;u&s;pended many Laws, without any
Oppo|&s;ition.</P>
<P>About this Time a War was declared with <HI>Spain,</HI> which was
carried on by the violent Humour of the Duke, who&s;e Power was &s;o great,
that he govern'd all without a Rival; which Preheminence he managed very
unthrif|tily, di&s;po&s;ing of all Places to his own Relati|ons, where there
was no Advantage or Profit to be had. <HI>This Partiality &s;hewed the Duke's
Weakne&s;s, and was much unbecoming the Great|ne&s;s of the King his Ma&s;ter,
who&s;e Honour &s;hould &s;hine upon the whole Body of his People, as the Sun
&s;heds his Influence, warming all Parts of the Earth.</HI> And where Kings
&s;hew them|&s;elves <PB N="17" REF="38"> partial to a Party, they are
u&s;ually &s;erved by the wor&s;t of the People, and are often forced to
protect the Bad again&s;t the Good, as we have often &s;een in our late
Revolutions: Not that Subjects repine, that Princes &s;hould have Friends with
whom they may communicate their Thoughts, and unbend their Cares, nor to &s;ee
&s;uch better'd by their Favours, which is warranted by the Example of the
be&s;t of Kings, who mu&s;t &s;ometimes recreate them&s;elves, and not be
always upon their Thrones, which would too much weary them. Greatne&s;s mu&s;t
be &s;et a&s;ide &s;ometimes, the better to be reli&s;hed: But Subjects do
behold with Indignation, Men to be exalted, who abu&s;e their Prince's Favours,
and by fal&s;e Repre&s;entations, traduce all others, that they may ingro&s;s
the Prince to them&s;elves, with|out Regard to the King's Honour, when their
par|ticular Advantage or Safety is in Que&s;tion. Such Mini&s;ters are
generally hated, and the People commonly reach their Heads at la&s;t. Wi&s;e
Prin|ces &s;hould never protect &s;uch Mini&s;ters; for when Princes bring
Projectors into the Admini&s;tration of their Affairs, who are Inventers of new
Taxes, they bring an Odium upon their Ma&s;ter; and the Ignorance of &s;uch Men
brings more Nece&s;&s;ities upon the Prince, than their Arts of rai&s;ing
Mo|ney can &s;upply. None but wanting Princes employ &s;uch Men, who
&s;ometimes can &s;kin over a Sore, which after breaks out with greater
Rancour: Whereas wi&s;e State&s;men would, by whole&s;om Coun&s;el, obviate the
Danger in its Growth, and re&s;train their King's extravagant 
<PB N="18" REF="39"> Bounty, before he hath nothing left to give: For the
Bounty of a Prince often frights Men from meddling in their Affairs. I know,
Li|berality is counted the proper Virtue of a Prince, it being much better for
him to be pro|fu&s;e, than avaritious, Prodigality having the Re&s;emblance of
&s;omething more noble, than Avarice, and really it is le&s;s odious; and they
that gain by it, make it pa&s;s for a Virtue, but perhaps it is more
prejudicial to Po&s;terity, and no le&s;s dangerous than the other Extreme. For
if a King give away his whole Kingdom, he cannot &s;atisfy all that a&s;k, no,
nor all that think they de&s;erve much from him. It is then more convenient to
give with Rea&s;on, and ne|ver to draw &s;o near the Bottom, but that Princes
may always have wherewith to gratify Per&s;ons of Merit; and above all, they
&s;hould take e&s;pe|cial Care, that their Liberality be exerci&s;ed without
Oppre&s;&s;ion of their People, to avoid Murmuring, which may produce
Rebellion. Wi&s;e Kings &s;hould never give, till their Coffers are full; for
the Mea&s;ures of Bounty ought to be taken from the Plenty of the Giver, as
well as the Merit of the Receiver: And Kings &s;eldom hurt them&s;elves by
giving what is actually in their Keeping, for Reward of particular Merit, but
giving things they never had (as King <HI>James</HI> I. actually did to his
Favourites) of which they know not the Value, is the Ruin of Princes
Trea&s;ure, and con&s;equently of their Affairs. For the Nece&s;&s;ities of
wanting Princes make them repeat Taxes, which lo&s;es them the 
<PB N="19" REF="40"> Affection of their Subjects; and Thrift hath ever been
e&s;teemed a Point of good Wi&s;dom in Kings, who &s;hould &s;tand firm
again&s;t all parti|cular Suits, &s;o that no Ca&s;e, upon what Grace &s;oever,
may break the Rule; for if one &s;trong Sheep breaks the Hedge, a Hundred
little ones will follow: And therefore the fir&s;t thing a King &s;hould learn
to &s;ay, is <HI>No,</HI> and that &s;o re|&s;olutely, as never to be a&s;ked
twice, nor once importunately: For one extravagant Gift to one, rai&s;es the
Market to every Man el&s;e; and the unlimited Bounty of a wanting Prince, makes
him a Beggar, tho' he have a va&s;t Reve|nue: And that Prince, who will give
more to Importunity than Merit, may as rea&s;onably forbid his Subjects doing
well, upon Penalty of being undone by it. Where Princes give, be|cau&s;e they
are importun'd, and where the le&s;s u&s;eful Part of the People have mo&s;t
Credit with their King, this &s;hews, the Way to get every thing, is to be good
for nothing; and tho' the &s;ervile Part of Mankind are apt to extol, not only
generous Princes, but tho&s;e that are pro|fu&s;e; yet if we con&s;ider the
Story of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, we &s;hall find their Decadence took its
Ri&s;e principally from this profu&s;e Temper, and that their Prodigality drove
them to Want, and made them oppre&s;s, and become odious to their People, by
their frequent Taxes. But we need not now make Laws again&s;t giving too much,
Princes are not &s;o free in this Age, and we want no Over&s;eer of that kind,
in our Court, at <HI>St. Germaine</HI>'s, where we live upon Alms.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="41">The good Emperor, <HI>Marcus Aurelius
Antoni|nus,</HI> in his Nature very bountiful, having given the People a larger
Donative than u&s;ual, was yet &s;o frugal of the publick Money, that, upon an
Expedition again&s;t the <HI>Scythians,</HI> he would not draw any Sum from the
Trea&s;ury, without fir&s;t a&s;king Leave of the Senate, affirming that he had
nothing in particular, and not &s;o much as the Hou&s;e he lived in. And being
another Time pre&s;&s;ed by his Army, for a Donative, after a &s;ignal Victory,
he refu&s;ed it, &s;aying, <HI>The more I give the young Soldiers, the more I
mu&s;t oppre&s;s their Parents.</HI> And therefore the <HI>Romans</HI> well
an&s;wer'd one of their Emperors demanding double Taxes: <HI>O Emperor, if thou
wilt have double Taxes, we mu&s;t have double Harve&s;ts.</HI> Kings are
Fathers of their Country, but unle&s;s they keep their own E&s;tates, they are
&s;uch Fathers as the Sons maintain, which is again&s;t the Order of Nature,
and the le&s;s a Father depends upon his Children, the more he is certainly
re&s;pected.</P>
<P>The Love of Subjects is not obtained by Mo|ney, but by wi&s;e
Government, and good Con|duct; and all People, even Soldiers, reverence their
Prince more, who keeps &s;omething in his Power to give, than he who gives all
away; Ex|pectation and Hope carrying Men farther than the Sen&s;e of pa&s;t or
pre&s;ent Benefits, and good Princes de&s;ire to make their People ea&s;y. King
<HI>Charles</HI> I. of <HI>England</HI> never refu&s;ed to ea&s;e his People of
any Grievance, and pa&s;&s;ed more Acts of Grace for the Benefit of his
Subjects, than <PB N="21" REF="42"> any five Kings or Queens had done before
him. He granted an Act of Triennial Parliament, and the perpetuating of them,
was an Act unparal|lel'd by any of his Predece&s;&s;ors: And good Sub|jects
&s;hould never think it ju&s;t, that the King's Condition &s;hould be wor&s;e,
by bettering theirs. But our good King counted him&s;elf undimini|&s;hed by his
large&s;t Conce&s;&s;ions, thinking by them to gain the Love of his People,
being per&s;waded he could not grant too much, nor di&s;tru&s;t too little, to
Men that being profe&s;&s;ed|ly his Subjects, pretended &s;ingular Piety, and
religious Strictne&s;s. But our King was much mi&s;taken, for no Fountain of
Royal Bounty was able to &s;atisfy their <HI>Corban</HI> of Religion: And it is
&s;ure, had that good King yielded le&s;s, he had been oppo&s;ed le&s;s; and
had he denied more, he had been more obeyed. Princes &s;hould therefore take
Care of running with the Stream; for, chu&s;ing a crooked Cour&s;e, for fear of
the Torrent, is not commonly very dangerous.</P>
<P>The Honour of a King con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in doing good to the
univer&s;al Body of his People, which good <HI>Charles</HI> aim'd at, there
being no|thing &s;o glorious for a Prince, as to let his Peo|ple enjoy Ea&s;e
and Plenty, and not to enrich a few Per&s;ons with the Spoils of a whole
Coun|try. <HI>Henry</HI> IV. of <HI>France</HI> &s;aid, he hoped &s;o to order
Matters, that every Man in his Kingdom might have a boil'd Capon for his
Dinner. Cer|tainly, no Apothegm, &s;o much by the Ancients commended, could
&s;o well become the Mouth <PB N="22" REF="43"> of a great King, as this
well-natur'd Saying; and it is probable, had he lived, he would have made good
his Word, which would have been a more durable Triumph to his Fame, than all
his great Victories; and his Example, who, by his Frugality, brought the Crown
of <HI>France</HI> out of Debt, is to be preferred to that of <HI>Henry</HI>
III. of <HI>France,</HI> who hara&s;&s;ed his whole Kingdom, to build up four
or five great Fami|lies, whereby he left behind him &s;o many con|&s;picuous
Monuments of his Folly and Weak|ne&s;s. And our King <HI>James</HI> I. followed
the Mea&s;ures of <HI>Henry</HI> III. in his mo&s;t extravagant Bounties, which
cau&s;ed the then Lord Trea&s;u|rer to put upon a long Table, where the King
was to pa&s;s by that Morning, a large Sum of Money in Silver, which the King
had given to one of his Favourites the Night before: The King being much
&s;urprized with the Sight, (having never &s;een &s;o much Money before
to|gether) a&s;ked the Trea&s;urer, who was behind him, what that Money was
for? who &s;aid, it was for &s;uch a Per&s;on, naming him to whom the King had
given it: To which the King pre&s;ently replied (with his u&s;ual Oath) it was
much more than any Man could de&s;erve from him, and commanded the Trea&s;urer
to pay him only one Quarter of it. This made the King more careful of his
future Bounties; tho' I may truly &s;ay, that this King (tho' to his own
Pre|judice) had more Compa&s;&s;ion of other Mens Nece&s;&s;ities, than of his
own Coffers; for, in Li|berality, he exceeded, by many Degrees, all the 
<PB N="23" REF="44"> Kings that ever went before him: And it had been much
better for King <HI>Charles,</HI> his Succe&s;|&s;or, if his Liberality had not
been &s;o great; for by that means, he left his Succe&s;&s;or much indebted,
which prov'd infinitely prejudicial both to the King and Kingdom.</P>
<P>Now, who&s;oever hath read King <HI>James</HI>'s Works, will find
therein mo&s;t rational and po|litick Di&s;cour&s;es of the Nature of
Government, and the good Temper of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Monarchy, where there
is no unnatural Swelling of Power, nor Liberty; for the&s;e two are like Heat
and Moi&s;ture, where they are well mix'd, every thing pro&s;pers, but where
they are &s;ingle, they are de&s;tructive; and our true lawful Govern|ment in
<HI>England</HI> is like our Climate, where there are &s;ometimes unquiet loud
Winds, which, tho' trouble&s;ome, yet they clear the Air, and much of Mens
Healths is owing to them. Ab|&s;olute Power is a Plant that will not grow up|on
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ground; tho&s;e who have attempted to cultivate it in that
Soil, have ha&s;tned their own Ruine. All Men mu&s;t confe&s;s, that King
<HI>James</HI>'s Di&s;cour&s;es in Parliaments were admira|ble, but the
practical Part was wanting; for his remi&s;s and loo&s;e Government was a great
Cau&s;e of our following Di&s;orders: For, finding no Money could be rai&s;ed,
to &s;upply his Nece&s;&s;i|ties, and extravagant Bounties, but by Parlia|ment,
he therefore &s;till care&s;&s;ed them, thinking that Way to prevent the ill
Humour, which lay in the Stomach of the Nation, which then be|gan to &s;hew it
&s;elf more publickly; and he <PB N="24" REF="45"> would often &s;ay, he was
but One King, that, in his Hou&s;e of Commons, were near Five Hun|dred; and
whil&s;t he liv'd in <HI>Scotland,</HI> his Pre&s;byterian Subjects &s;o much
teazed, and &s;o often impri&s;oned him, that he had as good al|mo&s;t been one
of the Kings of <HI>Brentford,</HI> as King of <HI>Scotland.</HI> However, this
King, con|tented with tho&s;e Dominions which he had by an undi&s;puted
Succe&s;&s;ion, coveted nothing more from his Neighbours, nor had other
Thoughts or Wi&s;hes, be&s;ides tho&s;e of the common Peace and Repo&s;e of
Chri&s;tendom, and had therefore a ju&s;t Motto given to his Arms, <HI>Beati
Pacifici.</HI> He had &s;o much Cunning, that he &s;till held well with his
Parliaments, and de&s;ired to be beloved, rather than feared by them: For
Pow|er, without Love, hath a terrifying A&s;pect, and the Wor&s;hip paid to it,
is like that which the <HI>Indians</HI> give, out of Fear, to wild Bea&s;ts and
Devils. And as he that fears God, only becau&s;e he is Almighty, wi&s;hes there
was no God; &s;o he that fears the King, only becau&s;e he can puni&s;h,
wi&s;hes there was no King; and therefore a King cannot take too much Care to
keep him&s;elf up: For if a King lets his People &s;lip from him, he is no
longer really their King, but the People may let a King fall, and &s;till
re|main a People.</P>
<P>In this Conjuncture, after Twenty Two Years peaceably reigning in
<HI>England,</HI> King <HI>James</HI> I. died, leaving his Son, then King
<HI>Charles,</HI> his Succe&s;&s;or, ingag'd in a War with <HI>Spain,</HI> by
Ad|vice of Parliament, without Supplies to &s;up|port <PB N="25" REF="46"> it,
and left his own Debts great, by his immoderate Bounty; to which a great
Addition was made, upon King <HI>Charles</HI>'s coming fir&s;t to the Crown,
and many Inconveniencies were then &s;ubmitted to, for Supply, contrary to
for|mer Laws; and Mi&s;carriages in Government e&s;caped in the Beginning of
this King's Reign, which happened thro' the ill Coun&s;el of &s;ome Men,
driving on their own private Ends, and the Peevi&s;hne&s;s of &s;ome others,
envying the Publick &s;hould be managed without them, join'd with the
in&s;uperable Nece&s;&s;ities of State, rather than from any Propen&s;ity in
the King, who was free from any Injuriou&s;ne&s;s, or Op|pre&s;&s;ion of his
People.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> was at this time received into an
admired Intimacy and Dearne&s;s by the King, and a Marriage was &s;oon
conclu|ded with the Prince&s;s <HI>Henrietta Maria</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> and
the Duke was &s;ent thither to con|duct her to the King. A little after this a
Par|liament was called, the Hou&s;e of Commons, upon their fir&s;t
A&s;&s;embly, pre&s;&s;ed for Redre&s;s of Grievances, and again&s;t
Recu&s;ants, and they gave the King two Sub&s;idies, which did not an&s;wer his
Wants and Expectations, nor at all &s;atisfy; and the King finding the
Parliament more &s;tiff than he expected, he &s;oon di&s;&s;olved them; that
&s;owre Humour again&s;t Kingly Pre|rogative being then very predominant in the
Hou&s;e of Commons; and the Duke, who, in the la&s;t Parliament of King
<HI>James,</HI> was &s;tiled, The Saviour of the People, in bringing Home 
<PB N="26" REF="47"> the then Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> was now called, The
De&s;troyer of the People, and more cry'd down, than he was before cry'd up,
and was named, the Corrupter of the King, and principal Cau&s;e of all
Di&s;order, who had betrayed the Subjects Liberties, and his ill Management was
made the Pretext for not a&s;&s;i&s;ting the King in Parlia|ment, as the State
of the King's Affairs then required; who u&s;ed all po&s;&s;ible Means to
&s;atis|fy a di&s;contented People, but could not. The late Parliament, before
their Di&s;&s;olution, de|clared, the King had &s;ent Ships into
<HI>France,</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t the <HI>French</HI> King again&s;t his
Prote&s;tant Subjects at <HI>Rochel,</HI> which was by the Duke's Intere&s;t,
without acquainting the Council of State, which much exa&s;perated the People,
who complain'd, that the Duke had not made the Match with <HI>Spain,</HI> out
of a particular Spleen again&s;t the <HI>Conde d'Olivares,</HI> and had made it
with <HI>France,</HI> upon much harder Terms.</P>
<P>The Duke being hereupon que&s;tioned in Par|liament, made a
plau&s;ible An&s;wer: However, the Hou&s;e of Commons re&s;olved again&s;t any
farther Supply (except the two Sub&s;idies they had given) without Redre&s;s of
Grievances. After the Di&s;&s;olution of this fir&s;t Parliament, &s;ome
provi&s;ional Acts of State were made, to &s;upply the Defects in Law, and a
Proclama|tion was publi&s;hed again&s;t Catholicks, to give the People &s;ome
Satisfaction, and a Fleet was &s;ent out by the Duke again&s;t <HI>Cadiz,</HI>
but retur|ned with ill Succe&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="48">In <HI>February</HI> following, a &s;econd
Parliament was called, and the King was &s;oon after crowned. The Lord Keeper
then made a Speech to the Parliament, declaring the King's Love to them,
&s;triving whether he &s;hould be a greater King, or a better Man; and that
they were called to make good Laws, and execute Ju&s;tice. The Hou&s;e of
Commons pre&s;ently fell upon Grie|vances, the Mi&s;carriage of the
<HI>Cadiz</HI> Voyage, the Mi&s;employment of the King's Revenue, and reflected
much upon the Duke, and &s;everal bold Speeches were made again&s;t him, and
great Animo&s;ities &s;till continued betwixt the Duke and the Earl of
<HI>Bri&s;tol.</HI> The King demands of the Parliament a pre&s;ent Supply, and
de&s;ired they would rather redre&s;s, than inquire into Grievances. The
Hou&s;e of Commons exhibi|ted Articles again&s;t the Duke, de&s;iring he might
have no more Acce&s;s to the King, and agreed upon a Remon&s;trance again&s;t
the Duke, and pray'd the King not to di&s;&s;olve them. The Duke being much
tran&s;ported with this U&s;age, prevailed with the King to di&s;&s;olve them,
and fell into &s;uch Anger again&s;t &s;ome principal Members, that they were
impri&s;oned or di&s;gra|ced &s;oon after Di&s;&s;olution. From this time the
People were generally apprehen&s;ive of an arbi|trary Government, and were much
un&s;atisfied with the exce&s;&s;ive Greatne&s;s of the Duke, who had a greater
A&s;cendant upon his new Ma&s;ter, the pre&s;ent King, than upon his
Predece&s;&s;or; which was much wondred at, that the &s;ame Per&s;on &s;hould
be the prime Favourite both to <PB N="28" REF="49"> Father and Son, which bred
a great Di&s;temper of Humours in the Court, which &s;oon de&s;cen|ded into the
Country, and the Di&s;plea&s;ure to the Favourite &s;oon &s;eized their Duty to
their Prince. Kings rai&s;e &s;ome Men &s;o high, as to over-top All, and keep
them under; but it is dangerous to be&s;tow too much upon one Man, for there is
no Man fitting to be a King, but he that is a King; and when Kings are
immo|derate in be&s;towing their Power, it many times brings much Woe to the
People, much Danger to the Per&s;on in Power, and not &s;eldom, much Sorrow to
the King him&s;elf: And a wi&s;e Prince will not oblige his Courtiers, who are
Birds of Prey, to di&s;oblige his Subjects, who are Bea&s;ts of Burthen. It was
indeed look'd upon as a rare Felicity, and &s;eldom known, that the Duke
&s;hould be in greater Favour with the Son, than he was with the Father: For,
the new King, from the Death of the old King, even to the Death of the Duke
him&s;elf, di&s;cover'd the mo&s;t entire Confidence, and even Friend&s;hip, to
the Duke, that ever King &s;hewed to any Subject; all Preferments were given by
him; all his Friends and Kindred to that Degree in Honour, Riches, or Offices,
as the Duke thought fit; all his Enemies di&s;countenanced, as he appointed:
But it was &s;trange, that he &s;hould &s;o &s;uddenly fall, from the
greate&s;t Heighth of popular E&s;ti|mation, to the lowe&s;t Depth of Calumny
and Reproach, by per&s;wading the King to di&s;&s;olve Parliaments, which
proved mo&s;t pernicious to the Duke him&s;elf; for, in the fir&s;t Parliament 
<PB N="29" REF="50"> of this King, tho' mo&s;t of the &s;ame Per&s;ons were
cho&s;en, who &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately adhered to him be|fore, the Affection they
had then for him, even of the &s;ame Men, was turned into Animo&s;ity again&s;t
him, and that in &s;o high a Nature, that all the Actions of his Life were ript
up, Votes and Remon&s;trances pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t him, as an Enemy to the
Publick, and his ill managing of the King's Grace and Favour to him, made the
Ground of their Refu&s;al to give the King that Supply which he expected, and
was highly ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the King, in that Conjuncture. Here all the
People's Di&s;contents were laid up|on the Duke, in re&s;pect of the mighty
Share he had in his Maje&s;ty's Favour and Affection, and that he managed his
Power, to the Eclip&s;e of all other great Men, and moulded the Court to the
Advantage principally of his own Family, thinking thereby to &s;trengthen
him&s;elf (in&s;tead of endeavouring to mollify the Mi&s;under&s;tan|dings
betwixt the King and his People, which was his true Intere&s;t:) But the Duke's
Want of Experience, having never &s;een or felt the Re|ver&s;e of Fortune, made
him too great an En|terprizer, to &s;ucceed in what he &s;o unadvi&s;edly
undertook, and &s;o precipitately, and for his own Satisfaction; and, upon his
&s;ingle Di&s;con|tent, fir&s;t ran the late King into a War with
<HI>Spain,</HI> which proved both fruitle&s;s and bur|then&s;ome to him. And
thus the Throne was endanger'd by him, who&s;e Obligation and true Intere&s;t
it was to uphold it; and King <HI>Charles</HI> did not only &s;ucceed to his
Royal Father's <PB N="30" REF="51"> Crown, but Troubles, who was left involved
in mo&s;t &s;trange Intrigues and Difficulties, the Coun&s;els of his
Mini&s;ters being not then con|ducted according to tho&s;e Rules and Mea&s;ures
of Policy, which the Circum&s;tances and Nece&s;&s;ities of the King's Affairs
required; which, if they had been well managed, had ea&s;ily prevented the
cruel Rebellion which afterwards followed.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee Princes cannot be &s;ecure, when leading Men in
their own Courts fall into Fa|ction; and when there is mo&s;t need of Concord
and Unity, Mens Minds are then mo&s;t di&s;uni|ted, and, contrary to ancient
Prudence, when <HI>England</HI> wanted the be&s;t, the wor&s;t Men were &s;et
at the Head of Bu&s;ine&s;s; and our then mo&s;t unhappy King, was, by
Diver&s;ity of Coun&s;els, drawn oftentimes from his own Judgment, (which was
better than theirs) and was forced many times to court tho&s;e he hated, and to
frown upon tho&s;e, who&s;e Abilities and faithful Services to the Crown he
&s;ecretly approved; which is u&s;ually the Fate of &s;uch Princes who are
drawn into Streights, either by their Pre|dece&s;&s;ors, or their own
Negligence; and at this time the greate&s;t Part of the King's Coun&s;el where
wholly taken up in the Improvement of their own Fortunes, or Gratification of
their Plea&s;ures which they earne&s;tly affected, and had &s;o much to do for
them&s;elves, that they wholly neglected the King's Affairs, and tho&s;e which
were mo&s;t able, were frighted from meddling in them; and when tho&s;e
Mini&s;ters, who&s;e Steadine&s;s of Judgment, and Directne&s;s 
<PB N="31" REF="52"> of Application to their Ma&s;ter's and the King|dom's
Honour and Advantage, e&s;trange them|&s;elves from Court, it abates Mens
Confidence in the &s;ucce&s;sful Cour&s;e of Affairs.</P>
<P>The King being put to the&s;e Streights, Ton|nage and Pondage were
levied by Order from the Board, and likewi&s;e Loan Money and Be|nevolence
taken; and the Duke finding the King &s;omewhat un&s;atisfied with the
<HI>French</HI> King, and that the Queen's Servants were &s;ending Home, his
Grace &s;oon changed the Scene, and cau&s;ed the King to declare War again&s;t
<HI>France,</HI> and went in Per&s;on to the I&s;le of <HI>Rhee,</HI> to
a&s;&s;i&s;t the <HI>Rochellers</HI> again&s;t their King; but he was there
defeated, and this Repul&s;e was more un|fortunate than that of <HI>Cadiz.</HI>
But, in <HI>March</HI> following, another Parliament was call'd, and the King
&s;pake to them, to expedite Bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;hewed them the common Danger,
moved for a Supply, and told them plainly, if they did not do their Duty, he
&s;hould be obliged to u&s;e other Mea|&s;ures, which would not be &s;o
plea&s;ing to them: But however, the Hou&s;e of Commons fell upon Grievances,
before Supply, and after many Debates, and &s;ome Conferences, the Petition of
Right was &s;etled by Act of Parliament, and &s;everal other Acts pa&s;&s;ed,
and then the Parlia|ment was prorogued till <HI>October.</HI></P>
<P>In this Interval the Duke re&s;olved upon a &s;econd Attempt
again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> and was prepa|ring for it at <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI>
but was prevented by his &s;udden Murder, which gave the King much Sorrow and
Trouble: And as the Duke, during <PB N="32" REF="53"> Life, was unfortunate in
publick Affairs, &s;o his &s;udden Death produced a Change in all Coun&s;els;
it being fir&s;t generally agreed, that the King &s;hould make a Peace with
both Crowns, &s;ince the War could not be carried on without Supplies, and the
Parliament was far|ther prorogued, till <HI>January,</HI> which was ill taken.
And Kings of <HI>England</HI> will never do well, to fence with the
Inclinations of their Parliaments, or Di&s;contents of their People; they
mu&s;t &s;hew they have no other Intere&s;ts, but tho&s;e of their Subjects in
general; for Par|tiality in a Prince produces Heart-Burnings, to &s;ee &s;ome
few lifted up high, wallowing in Wealth and Plea&s;ures, while the People groan
under heavy Taxes. A Government is never well e&s;tabli&s;h'd but in the Hearts
of the Sub|jects, nor &s;o hard to be &s;haken, as when the Generality of the
People, as well as the Nobi|lity, are intirely &s;atisfied; which they will
ne|ver be, till they &s;ee Men cho&s;en into Offices, by being fit for them,
and continued for di&s;char|ging well, and rewarded for extraordinary Me|rit,
and puni&s;hed for remarkable Faults. In &s;uch Ca&s;es, the King di&s;charges
the Severity of all Puni&s;hments upon the Parliament, and com|mits no Force
upon the Gentlene&s;s of his own Nature, when his Subjects &s;ee, that no
Ten|derne&s;s of their Prince, nor Corruption of his Mini&s;ters, can
pre&s;erve them from paying what they owe to any Forfeits of their Duty; nor
indeed can any Prince do Ju&s;tice to tho&s;e that &s;erve him well, without
puni&s;hing tho&s;e that <PB N="33" REF="54"> &s;erve him ill, &s;ince that is
to make their Con|ditions equal, who&s;e De&s;erts are different. And therefore
Kings &s;hould not only con&s;ent to, but encourage any Inquiries a Parliament
&s;hall make into the Mi&s;carriages of Mini&s;ters, and join willingly with
them therein: But whether, at that Time that the Parliament would have
que&s;tioned the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> they did then proceed from a
&s;teady Intention of a general Good, or from &s;ome particular Animo&s;ities
again&s;t the Duke, or from &s;ome accidental Di&s;tempers, from which the
greate&s;t and be&s;t A&s;&s;emblies are not always free, is &s;till a great
Que&s;tion; e&s;pecially when &s;uch A&s;&s;em|blies have continued long
together: For then they will &s;py out, and look after Mi&s;carriages and
Grievances, rather than &s;upply their law|ful King and Sovereign. 'Tis
certainly true, when Kings of <HI>England</HI> meet often with their
Parliaments, and agree with them, they may command what they plea&s;e: But if a
King's Revenue be &s;uch, as to enable him to live without his Parliament, he
will be more free; for the Meeting and long Sitting of Parliaments is
dangerous; for u&s;ually, when publick Bu&s;i|ne&s;s is ended (nay, many times
before they have ended it) they fall upon Grievances, and enter into Factions,
to the great Prejudice of both King and Kingdom (as hath been often &s;een) and
therefore <HI>Po&s;ning</HI>'s Law was a good Pro|vi&s;ion again&s;t long
Sitting of Parliaments. However, when Parliaments re&s;olve to go upon
Grievances, Kings &s;hould never interpo&s;e, to <PB N="34" REF="55"> &s;ecure
their Favourites from an&s;wering Crimes which are alledged again&s;t them in
Parliament, as was intended again&s;t the Duke, before the Parliament was
prorogued; for it lays an Im|putation upon the Prince, as being privy to their
Actions, and fixes al&s;o a Scandal upon the Per&s;on accu&s;ed, that he is
generally thought guilty of all things laid to his Charge. And this Cour&s;e,
which was taken in the Beginning of King <HI>Charles</HI>'s Government, of
Proroguing and Di&s;&s;olving Parliaments, rendred the Duke of
<HI>Buckingham</HI>'s Power more formidable, be|cau&s;e it was thought
unlimited; and tho' he was e&s;teemed but as an Idol &s;et up by King
<HI>James,</HI> and was therefore more contemptible to the People; yet, at the
&s;ame time, they thought the pre&s;ent King &s;tood in Awe of him, and was
afraid to pull down that Favourite, who was grown &s;o formidable by his Power,
and the Number of his Followers and Adhe|rents; but &s;uch top-heavy Buildings,
which have no &s;olid Foundation in them, of Merit, are &s;oon blown down; and
let bad Men have never &s;o much &s;eeming Greatne&s;s and Power, they are
&s;eldom dangerous to wi&s;e Princes, who will never hinder them from being
brought to Puni&s;hment, by a timely Sacrifice; and no Man ever yet &s;aw a
Tumult to defend them. And if this great Favourite, the Duke, had not been &s;o
&s;oon murdered, he had certainly been made a Victim to the Publick, by the
Parliament. And when this Parliament met in <HI>January,</HI> they were very
trouble&s;ome, fell upon Grievan|ces, <PB N="35" REF="56"> and made &s;ome
A&s;&s;aults again&s;t the Prero|gative, and were preparing &s;ome
Accu&s;ations again&s;t the Lord Trea&s;urer <HI>We&s;ton:</HI> And tho' the
King &s;ent the Black Rod for the Commons, to come to the Hou&s;e of Lords,
they locked the Door of their Hou&s;e, and not only refu&s;ed Entrance to the
Black Rod, but forced the Speaker to his Chair, till they had adjourned the
Hou&s;e to a Day, thinking thereby not to be di&s;&s;olved before the Day of
their Adjourn|ment. However, the King went in Per&s;on to the Hou&s;e of Lords,
without calling the Com|mons, and di&s;&s;olved the Parliament, affirming, that
&s;ome Vipers in the Hou&s;e of Commons, were the Cau&s;e of his di&s;&s;olving
them, and at the &s;ame time very much courted and commen|ded the Lords; and,
after this Di&s;&s;olution, &s;ome of tho&s;e Members who had carried
them|&s;elves very in&s;olently, were committed to &s;eve|ral Pri&s;ons, and
the King, to &s;atisfy his People, publi&s;hed a Proclamation, &s;hewing the
Cau&s;es of di&s;&s;olving tho&s;e three Parliaments.</P>
<P>In the Year 1630, Prince <HI>Charles</HI> was born, at who&s;e
Birth great Rejoicing was thro' the whole Kingdom; and in 1633, the King went
to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and was there Crowned with great Solemnity. At his
Return, in 1634, Ship-Money was rai&s;ed with great Care and Equality, by
Letters written from the Privy-Council to every High-Sheriff; and tho' this
Pill was gilded, it would not be &s;wallowed, but great Di&s;contents were
expre&s;s'd at an Impo&s;ition never before practi&s;ed, and again&s;t Law: But
yet this was <PB N="36" REF="57"> done by the Advice and &s;olemn Agreement of
all the Judges, (except two, <HI>Hatton</HI> and <HI>Crook</HI>) who argued
again&s;t it. However, they &s;ub&s;cri|bed for the King's doing it; neither
did the Judges do &s;o much in this, as was done in the Parliament of 31
<HI>H.</HI> VIII. when it was agreed, that the Legi&s;lative Power &s;hould be
in the King and his Council, in Intervals of Parliament; and that the King's
Proclamation &s;hould be of equal Force with an Act of Parliament: And this was
thought fit by the Parliament, as being a dangerous thing, that the King
&s;hould be at Di&s;advantage, for Want of Power, in Ca&s;e of &s;udden
Exigencies. And therefore there was Rea&s;on, that the King &s;hould &s;teer
with a &s;hor|ter Rudder, that his Care might meet with every Turn of
Providence, which might otherwi&s;e &s;uddenly overturn the good Government of
the Nation: And it was then al&s;o declared in Par|liament, that if the Motions
at home &s;hould wait upon the Debates in Parliament, things mu&s;t needs come
&s;hort in Execution, and the Affairs of the Nation extremely &s;uffer. And
tho' this was but a temporary Law, during the then pre&s;ent Condition of
Affairs; yet, in the 34 and 35 of the &s;ame King, another Law was made to
confirm what was done before, with a Power granted to the King and Council, to
change and alter, as they &s;hould think fit. And certainly the &s;ame Rea&s;on
held as &s;trong, du|ring the trouble&s;ome and impetuous Reign of King
<HI>Charles,</HI> tho' he thought not convenient to demand any &s;uch Power.
<HI>The Opinion of</HI> <PB N="37" REF="58"> <HI>the Judges was &s;ub&s;cribed
in the&s;e Words fol|lowing.</HI></P>
<Q>We are of Opinion, that when the Good and Safety of the Kingdom in
general is concerned, and the whole Kingdom in Danger, your Maje|&s;ty may by
Writ, under the Great Seal of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> command all your Subjects of
this King|dom, at their Charge, to provide and furni&s;h &s;uch Number of
Ships, with Men, Victuals, and Ammunition, and for &s;uch Time as your
Maje&s;ty &s;hall think fit, for the Defence and Safeguard of the Kingdom, from
&s;uch Peril and Danger; and that, by the Law, your Maje&s;ty may compel the
doing hereof; and, in Ca&s;e of Refu&s;al, or Refractorine&s;s, we are al&s;o
of Opinion, that your Maje&s;ty is the &s;ole Judge, both of the Danger, and
when and how the &s;ame is to be prevented and avoided.</Q>
<P>The King did nothing herein, but what he was advi&s;ed to do by
his Judges, who were al|ways e&s;teemed the King's learned Council in the Law;
and if any thing was ami&s;s in this Particular, the Advi&s;ers were to
an&s;wer for it, which they did, and &s;ome of them were &s;uffici|ently
puni&s;hed for it: But whether they were puni&s;hed de&s;ervedly, or not, is
yet a Que&s;tion. Soon after the King's Return from <HI>Scotland,</HI> Bi&s;hop
<HI>Laud</HI> &s;ucceeded Archbi&s;hop <HI>Abbot</HI> in the See of
<HI>Canterbury,</HI> who being very powerful with the King, advi&s;ed the
Setling the Church Government in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as it was in
<HI>England,</HI> that there might be an Uniformity of Church Di&s;cipline in
both Kingdoms; and the King <PB N="38" REF="59"> &s;ent down his Orders
accordingly, with a new Service Book of Common-Prayer, with Com|mand to be read
in all the Churches: But ma|licious and de&s;igning Men, who de&s;ire
Innova|tions in State, do mo&s;t commonly begin their fir&s;t Attempt upon the
Church, as was &s;een in <HI>Scotland,</HI> by their Commotions upon this
Occa|&s;ion, when they were, at that time, by God's Mercy to us, and the King's
Care over us, in perfect Peace with all the Nations upon Earth. The King, by
the Marque&s;s of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> his Commi&s;&s;ioner, did all he could to
quiet tho&s;e Troubles; yet nothing would do, for the <HI>Scots</HI> made a
Covenant together, and declared never to renounce it, but prepared for War; and
from thence &s;prung the true Fountain of all our en|&s;uing Mi&s;eries in
<HI>England.</HI> This kind of Pre&s;by|terian Government, which was then
e&s;tabli&s;hed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> had found good Reception in &s;ome of the
<HI>Gallican</HI> and <HI>Belgian</HI> Churches, and which <HI>Beza</HI> u&s;ed
his utmo&s;t Endeavours to plant in <HI>England:</HI> But wary Queen
<HI>Elizabeth</HI> &s;tood fix'd, and could not be brought to any
Un&s;ettlement of the ancient Di&s;cipline of Epi&s;|copacy: But in
<HI>Scotland</HI> this new Form pro&s;pe|red, by the Artifices of
<HI>Buchanan</HI> and <HI>Knox,</HI> and during King <HI>James</HI>'s Minority,
they threw down Bi&s;hops, and &s;etled Pre&s;bytery, and u&s;ed their King as
they plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>About this Time, the &s;hort Parliament of 1640 drew near; the
King being then at <HI>York,</HI> was preparing to return to <HI>London.</HI>
It was then con&s;idered, whether the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> 
<PB N="39" REF="60"> &s;hould &s;tay with the Army, or go with the King to
<HI>London.</HI> The Earl &s;hewed many &s;ub&s;tantial Rea&s;ons for his not
going, and knowing how much the <HI>Scots</HI> were incen&s;ed again&s;t him,
and how great an Intere&s;t they would have in the Parliament: That, by his
Ab&s;ence, he would not be &s;o much in their Mind; and that if any thing
&s;hould be objected again&s;t him, he might the better avoid, and retire from
any Danger, and be better able to do the King Service el&s;e|where, when the
King's Occa&s;ions &s;hould require it (as he much feared they would;) but no
Ar|guments could prevail, but the King continued earne&s;t for his going with
him, and a&s;&s;ured him in the Word of a King, if he &s;hould be que&s;tioned,
he would &s;o defend him, that a Hair of his Head &s;hould not be touched; and
&s;o the Earl re&s;olved to &s;ubmit to the King's Commands, tho' he fore&s;aw
his own De&s;truction in it.</P>
<P>In <HI>April</HI> 1640, the Parliament met, when
<HI>Glanville</HI> was cho&s;en Speaker. A Me&s;&s;age was &s;oon &s;ent by the
King to the Hou&s;e of Commons, for Supplies, &s;hewing the intolerable
Indignities and Injuries of the <HI>Scots,</HI> who had not only common Ties of
Nature, Sovereignty, and Bounty upon that Nation, with his late royal Father,
but had twice gratified the active Spi|rit among them &s;o far, that he had
preferred the De&s;ires of that Party before his own Inte|re&s;t or Honour; and
his royal Bounty to them had emboldened them to a&s;k and act beyond all Bounds
of Mode&s;ty and Gratitude, which made the King more &s;candalized at their
coming into <PB N="40" REF="61"> <HI>England,</HI> contrary to his Will, and
with the Forfeiture of &s;o many Obligations of Duty to him. It is true, that
when they fir&s;t entered <HI>England,</HI> Succe&s;s crowned their Work, being
thought a wi&s;e and re&s;olute Nation, who, after an unbloody War, for above
one Year, returned laden with Spoils, and great Riches, and were mo&s;t
liberally rewarded, as well for going out, as coming into <HI>England:</HI> But
God's Ju&s;tice was in the End di&s;covered through all their Preten|tions of
Religion, in which they wrapt up their wicked De&s;igns, who built their Piety
upon the Ruines of Loyalty, and made Bankrupt of their Allegiance, to &s;et up
a quicker Trade for Re|ligion. Upon this Account, the King (as he had good
Rea&s;on) was very angry with them, and declared, if the Hou&s;e of Commons
would a&s;&s;i&s;t him &s;uitable to the Exigency of his Affairs, he would not
only quit his Claim to Ship-Mo|ney, but would give them full Satisfaction in
all their ju&s;t Demands; which Me&s;&s;age was much approved by both Hou&s;es,
and many Con|ferences were held, whether the Supply, or the Subjects Grievances
&s;hould precede. The Lords voted for the fir&s;t, but the Commons for the
latter; however, the Difference was &s;oon unhappily decided by a voluntary
Mi&s;take in old Sir <HI>Henry Vane,</HI> then Secretary of State, who was
ordered by the King and Council, to demand &s;ix Sub&s;idies, and he demanded
twelve; which was &s;o highly unrea&s;onable, that many were much
di&s;plea&s;ed, but all were inclined to have given &s;ix, which was no u&s;ual
Gift.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="62">Sir <HI>Henry Vane</HI> e&s;caped not without
great Cen&s;ure, for demanding Double to his Com|mi&s;&s;ion; but it was really
believed, this Mi|&s;take was purpo&s;ely done, to rai&s;e the Hou&s;e to
Animo&s;ities, which took Effect; for the Hou&s;e would not con&s;ent to what
he demanded, but in&s;i&s;ted upon their Grievances, which made the King &s;o
de&s;perate, that he forthwith di&s;&s;ol|ved the Parliament. The Coun&s;el
given to di&s;&s;olve them was generally di&s;liked, becau&s;e the Differences
between the King and this Par|liament might have been cemented by the Lords,
and the <HI>Scots</HI> Troubles, by this Parliament, appea&s;ed, which grew
wider by this Breach; and the Odium of this was laid upon Archbi|&s;hop
<HI>Laud,</HI> who was thought to be more bu&s;y in temporal Matters, than he
ought; and be|ing too full of Fire (tho' a ju&s;t, good Man) his too much Zeal
for the Church made him per|&s;wade the King to the Sitting of the Convoca|tion
(which ought not to have been done) af|ter Di&s;&s;olution of the Parliament.
The King then cau&s;ed a Guard to be &s;et about <HI>We&s;tmin|&s;ter,</HI>
while the Convocation &s;at, who &s;etled the Di&s;cipline of the Church, and
would not alter the Government by Bi&s;hops, and they granted a Benevolence to
the King, of Four Shillings in the Pound, for &s;ix Years, towards his
Expe|dition again&s;t the <HI>Scots,</HI> wherein the Archbi|&s;hop was very
active. The <HI>Scots</HI> were at this time come into a warmer Climate than
their own, and Petitioned the King for Redre&s;s of their Grievances, in
&s;everal Articles. All good <PB N="42" REF="63"> Men inveighed &s;ufficiently
again&s;t them, whil&s;t others approved of their Proceedings. There was at
this time a &s;trange Spirit of Divi&s;ion in the Opinions of Men, of the&s;e
Affairs; too many not only favouring, but joining with the <HI>Scotch</HI>
Covenanters, who pre&s;ented their De|mands, How their Army &s;hould be
maintained, till the Treaty was ended, and Peace &s;ecured; and &s;o they had a
great Allowance: But the King's be&s;t Subjects &s;aid, the King &s;hould
rather have put All to the I&s;&s;ue of a Battle, than to give &s;uch Terms to
mo&s;t rebellious Subjects. But the King &s;aw plainly, that divers Officers of
his own Army, and even the private Soldi|ers, had no Mind to fight again&s;t
the <HI>Scots,</HI> which made the King conclude the Treaty with them. The Earl
of <HI>Montro&s;e,</HI> who had great Alliances in <HI>Scotland,</HI> came then
into <HI>England,</HI> to &s;erve the King, but by the Marque&s;s of
<HI>Hamilton</HI>'s Cunning, (who betrayed the King in all the <HI>Scotch</HI>
Affairs) <HI>Montro&s;e</HI> was &s;lighted and neglected, whereupon he went
back to the Covenanters; but being &s;oon weary of them, he wrote to the King,
profe&s;&s;ing his great Loy|alty and Service to his Maje&s;ty; which Letter
was taken out of the King's Pocket at Night, by the Marque&s;s of
<HI>Hamilton,</HI> and &s;ent to the Covenanters.</P>
<P>About this Time, a Re&s;olution was taken by the King and Council,
to call another Parlia|ment, the great Nece&s;&s;ity of the King's Affairs then
obliging him to it. The Court Party la|boured much to bring in their Friends,
but <PB N="43" REF="64"> tho&s;e that were mo&s;t e&s;teemed at Court, had
lea&s;t Re&s;pect and Intere&s;t in the Country; and it was not a little
&s;trange to &s;ee, what a Spirit of Oppo&s;ition was in the Hearts of mo&s;t
Men, to the Court's Proceeding: So that very few of the King's Party were
cho&s;en Members of Par|liament. And indeed the highe&s;t Danger in
<HI>England</HI> comes from the Power of the People to elect their
Repre&s;entatives; for they will be &s;uch as are of their own Complexion, and
which will &s;tand by them in all their De&s;igns again&s;t the Government, for
clipping the Wings of Monarchy, and re&s;training the King's lawful
Prerogative; which was the true Rea&s;on why the King broke &s;o many
Parliaments; but at la&s;t being wearied, and overborne, he was
nece&s;&s;ita|ted to give Way to their Meeting in 1641, which, by &s;everal
Encroachments upon the Royal Prerogative, their long Sitting, and Suc|ce&s;s in
their Rebellion, brought their lawful Sovereign at la&s;t to the Block, as will
be &s;een in the Sequel of the&s;e <HI>Memoirs.</HI></P>
<P>This Long Parliament was convened to meet <HI>November</HI> 3.
1641. a mo&s;t ominous Day! for the Parliament met that Day, in 20 <HI>H.</HI>
VIII. which began with the Fall of Cardinal <HI>Wol&s;ey</HI>; and therefore
Archbi&s;hop <HI>Laud</HI> was de&s;ired to get their Meeting adjourned for
&s;ome Days: But the good Man took no Notice of tho&s;e things. At their
fir&s;t Meeting, the King told them, he was re&s;olved to put him&s;elf freely
upon the Love and Affection of his Subjects, and left it intirely to them,
where to begin, <PB N="44" REF="65"> promi&s;ing them Redre&s;s of Grievances,
and de|&s;ired that all Su&s;picion of each other &s;hould be laid a&s;ide. The
Hou&s;e of Commons, after e&s;tabli&s;hing Committees, fell upon Grievances,
and many &s;harp Speeches were made upon that Subject. The King pa&s;&s;ed the
Bill for the Tri|ennial Parliament, and thereby declared his great Confidence
in them, and the extraordina|ry Favour he did his Subjects, by pa&s;&s;ing that
Bill. The Hou&s;e of Commons fell pre&s;ently upon the Earl of
<HI>Strafford,</HI> whom they accu|&s;ed of High Trea&s;on, and de&s;ired he
might be &s;ecured, which was done accordingly, and great Preparations made for
his Trial in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall,</HI> before the Lords; and one of the
&s;harpe&s;t Managers of the Evidence again&s;t his Lord&s;hip, &s;ays, That
<HI>No Man ever acted a Part on &s;uch a Theatre with more Wi&s;dom,
Elo|quence, and Con&s;tancy, and with greater Rea&s;on, Judgment and Temper,
and with a better Grace,</HI> than that great Lord and excellent Per&s;on did,
&s;o that he moved the Hearts of all his Auditors (&s;ome few excepted) to
great Pity and Remor&s;e. His Lord&s;hip told them, it was hard that
Pu|ni&s;hment &s;hould precede Promulgation of a Law; to be puni&s;hed by a Law
&s;ub&s;equent to the Fact, was never heard of till that time; that there
&s;hould no Mark be &s;et, by which the Offence might be known, no
Admoni&s;h|ment given to avoid it, was a Ca&s;e extreme hard. The King heard
all the Tryal, and after went to the Hou&s;e of Lords, and &s;ent for the
Commons, and did pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ire the Par|liament <PB N="45" REF="66">
not to proceed &s;everely again&s;t the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI>
a&s;&s;uring them in the Word of a Chri&s;tian, that he could not in
Con&s;cience con|demn him, and added, that neither Fear, nor any other
Re&s;pect, &s;hould make him go again&s;t his Con&s;cience. However, the Bill
of Attain|der pa&s;&s;ed both Hou&s;es, and a Bill not to pro|rogue, adjourn,
or di&s;&s;olve the Parliament, without Con&s;ent of both Hou&s;es. Thus, when
Men &s;eek to limit and confine the King to their Rea&s;on, they mu&s;t needs
have a &s;ecret Aim to &s;hare with him, or u&s;urp upon him in his Pow|er and
Dominion: For good Men in Parliament will propo&s;e nothing to their King, nor
expect any thing from their King, but what he will be as ready to give them, as
they are to receive from him.</P>
<P>The King was much perplexed at the &s;ending to him the&s;e two
Bills, and &s;ent for &s;ome of his Bi&s;hops, and others of his intimate
Coun&s;el|lours, to have their Advice what Mea&s;ures to take, who advi&s;ed
him to pa&s;s the Bills: And the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> being informed of
the King's great Perplexity, wrote to the King, de|&s;iring him to pa&s;s the
Bill again&s;t him, &s;aying, his Con&s;ent would acquit the King before
Al|mighty God. Whereupon the King pa&s;&s;ed the Bill, and &s;ent Mr. Secretary
<HI>Carleton,</HI> to ac|quaint the Earl with it, who not believing, without
&s;ome A&s;toni&s;hment, that the King would have pa&s;&s;ed the Bill, he
ro&s;e from his Chair, and lifting up his Eyes to Heaven, clapp'd his Hand upon
his Brea&s;t, and &s;aid with &s;ome <PB N="46" REF="67"> Pa&s;&s;ion, <HI>Put
not your Tru&s;t in Princes, nor in the Sons of Men, for there is no Truth in
them;</HI> which he had &s;ome Rea&s;on to &s;ay, becau&s;e the King had
engaged him to come to <HI>London,</HI> con|trary to his own Sentiment, and had
faithfully a&s;&s;ured him, in the Word of a King, that in Ca&s;e he &s;hould
be attack'd in Parliament, he would &s;o defend him, that a Hair of his Head
&s;hould not be touched. And now by this un|expected Me&s;&s;age, he had Notice
given him of his Death, to which he really believed the King would never have
con&s;ented; which made him break out in that Expre&s;&s;ion, with &s;ome more
than ordinary Movement, believing his Letter to the King would have made him
more firm in his Re&s;olution. Great Reflections were made upon the King's
pa&s;&s;ing the&s;e two Bills, the one again&s;t his mo&s;t faithful Servant,
and the other again&s;t him&s;elf: The fir&s;t took away the Life of that great
State&s;man, the other his own Life, both Bills being &s;igned at the &s;ame
Time, and with the &s;ame Pen. The King had great Remor&s;e for what he had
done, and the next Day &s;ent a Letter to the Lords written with his own Hand,
by the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> to inter|cede for the Earl's Life; but nothing
would prevail, tho' it was confidently affirmed by &s;ome, that the Earl's Life
was promi&s;ed the King, to encourage him to pa&s;s the Bill: But now the Lords
would not con&s;ent to his Maje|&s;ty's De&s;ire. And thus fell this noble
Earl, who, for natural Parts and Abilities, for Im|provement of Knowledge, by
Experience in <PB N="47" REF="68"> greate&s;t Affairs; for Wi&s;dom, Fidelity,
Obe|dience, and Gallantry, left no Equal behind him. A little after this, to
&s;atisfy the King in &s;omewhat, the Hou&s;e of Commons granted an Act for
Tonnage and Pondage, which the King took before as due by his Prerogative, but
now as a Gift from his People.</P>
<P>The Parliament then adjourned till Winter, it being thought fit
the King &s;hould go into <HI>Scot|land,</HI> the People there beginning to
&s;hew their Di&s;contents more publickly, where the King being in Per&s;on
might better redre&s;s their Grie|vances, as they call'd them. The King then
granted every thing they de&s;ired, without a&s;k|ing any Que&s;tions, till
they declared they had no more to a&s;k, the King having entirely fulfil|led
their De&s;ires, and (as the Phra&s;e then went) <HI>He parted, a contented
King, from a contented People.</HI> For, from the Time of the King's co|ming
among them, he had fully complied with all they de&s;ired, both for the publick
Govern|ment, and their private Advancements. The Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
within it &s;elf, enjoyed perfect Peace and Tranquillity, and the King was
confident, the Affections of the <HI>Scots</HI> could not be corrupted,
believing they were &s;en&s;ible of their former Breach of Duty, and willing to
repair it by any Service; and that their Gene|ral, <HI>Le&s;ly,</HI> had made
great Acknowledgments and Profe&s;&s;ions of Duty to his Maje&s;ty, and would
be always ready and willing to &s;erve him. About the End of <HI>November</HI>
this Year, the King returned well &s;atisfied from <HI>Scotland,</HI> and was, 
<PB N="48" REF="69"> upon his Arrival, mo&s;t &s;umptuou&s;ly entertained by
the City of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>The King then went to the Parliament, and made a Speech to both
Hou&s;es, wherein he told them, he made as much Ha&s;te to them, as his Affairs
in <HI>Scotland</HI> permitted; and that he had left that Nation in a mo&s;t
peaceable and con|tented Condition: And yet he was no &s;ooner gone from them,
but they &s;ub&s;cribed their Co|venant, rai&s;ed an Army again&s;t their
lawful King, made <HI>Le&s;ly</HI> their General, to join with their dear
Brethren in <HI>England,</HI> who were then hatching a Rebellion again&s;t
their King, who then told them in Parliament, That tho' he did not find
<HI>England</HI> &s;o well &s;etled as he expected, (being full of
Jealou&s;ies, and Alarms of De|&s;igns and Plots) yet he doubted not of his
Sub|jects good Affections, by his Reception at his Return: And added, That he
was &s;o far from repenting what he had done for them, that he was willing and
ready to pa&s;s any thing more, that might ju&s;tly be de&s;ired, for their
Liberties, Properties, and Maintenance of their Religion; and de&s;ired them
not to be di&s;contented at their own Happine&s;s, nor to be without Sen&s;e of
their natural Allegiance: And that having got|ten the Opinion of being good
Patriots for their Country, they &s;hould not be inveigled into Steps of
Di&s;loyalty, nor to u&s;e &s;uch Mea&s;ures as would di&s;turb the Throne. The
King al&s;o re|commended to them the Bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Ireland,</HI> where,
it &s;eems a Rebellion broke out, during his Ab&s;ence in <HI>Scotland</HI>;
and the King offered <PB N="49" REF="70"> to go thither in Per&s;on, to
pro&s;ecute tho&s;e Re|bels, but the Parliament would not agree to it. Now, he
that governs three Kingdoms, com|po&s;ed of three &s;everal Nations, who&s;e
Religi|on, Manners, and Language are different, and who&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions and
Intere&s;ts are contrary to each other, mu&s;t keep a con&s;tant &s;evere Hand
over them: For, to think of governing them, as King <HI>Charles</HI> I. did, by
a gentle and obliging Temper, was as impo&s;&s;ible, as to think of put|ting
&s;ix wild Hor&s;es to a Coach, and to drive them without Whip or Reins. And
whoever hath read the pious Meditations of King <HI>Charles,</HI> hath there
found by his own Words, that he conde&s;cended again&s;t his own Judgment and
Con&s;cience, to &s;ettle Pre&s;bytery in <HI>Scot|land</HI>; and it appeared
&s;oon after, how unhap|py this King was, in his too kind and tender
Conde&s;cen&s;ions to the <HI>Scots,</HI> which occa&s;ioned all tho&s;e
Troubles he had in the North of <HI>Eng|land.</HI> The Pre&s;byterians called
God to witne&s;s, that nothing was &s;o dear to them, as the Honour and Safety
of the King, and at the &s;ame time they con&s;pired again&s;t both. They
&s;eemed won|derfully &s;ollicitous for his Life and Safety, when they were
complotting how to entrap him: They told us, their dear Liberties and
Proper|ties hung upon the Thread of the King's Life, and yet, at that
In&s;tant, they were re&s;olved to cut that Thread off. But the good
Chri&s;tians of old did not u&s;e this Method; they prayed for their Princes
and Governours, when mo&s;t bar|barou&s;ly and unju&s;tly provoked to the
contrary; <PB N="50" REF="71"> &s;o that no Chri&s;tian died as a Rebel or
Traytor, in all the early Per&s;ecutions of Chri&s;tianity, for &s;everal
Centuries. The Pre&s;byterians made it their Bu&s;ine&s;s, by their libellous
Pamphlets, and other wicked Arts, not only to make the King's Government
odious, his faithful Subjects &s;u&s;pected, but al&s;o to excite a Hatred to
his Royal Per&s;on; and made u&s;e of the Name of <HI>Popery,</HI> to carry on
all their wicked De&s;igns, being the common Engine they have always play'd
again&s;t the Government. For it hath been ob&s;erved, that the Prerogative
never &s;o &s;uffered, no great State&s;man was ever di&s;gra|ced, nor the
Liberties of the People ever wounded, but a dreadful Outcry of <HI>Popery</HI>
hath &s;till preceded; and if any dur&s;t &s;hew his Fidelity to Monarchy, by
oppo&s;ing their Anti|monarchical Projects, he was pre&s;ently bla&s;ted with
the Name of a <HI>Court,</HI> or a <HI>Church Papi&s;t:</HI> And when they
could not undermine the Go|vernment by Fraud, they would overthrow it by main
Force, and always had tho&s;e in great E&s;timation, who made the bigge&s;t
Noi&s;e for Religion, and made no Scruple of involving three Kingdoms in
Mi&s;ery and Confu&s;ion. They &s;trained at Conformity, but &s;wallowed down
Rebellion; they &s;tumbled at the Rails before the Altar, but leap'd over
Dethroning their King, whom they murdered fir&s;t in his Reputation, by calling
him Tyrant, (who&s;e Fault was only his Clemency) and then they murdered him in
his Per&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="72">I remember well what <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI>
&s;ays in his <HI>Antiquities, Lib.</HI> 17. <HI>Cap.</HI> 3. That the
<HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> were a bold Sect, that would &s;wear Allegiance to
<HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> but were inveterate Enemies to Kings, and would not &s;tick
to make Attempts upon their Lives: And the Difference betwixt tho&s;e
<HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> and ours is, that they were <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Fanaticks,
and ours are Chri&s;tian <HI>Jews,</HI> which appears by their Principles, who
&s;ay, the King holds not his Power <HI>Jure Divino,</HI> but is the People's
Tru&s;tee, and to them accountable: A Doctrine which leads to the De&s;truction
of all Kings. What our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour told his Di&s;|ciples, that <HI>the
Times were coming, when they that killed them &s;hould think they did God good
Service,</HI> was &s;een about this Time, when Chur|ches were pulled down for
God's Glory, when Religion was called <HI>Popery,</HI> and Monarchy
<HI>Tyranny</HI>; when Athei&s;ts would reform Religion, Bankrupts &s;ecure
Property, and Army Officers guard Liberty: When the Property of Nobi|lity and
Gentry was held to be de&s;tructive of Liberty, and it was a dangerous thing
for Men to have any Sen&s;e of their Duty and Allegiance. But alas! tho&s;e
that foment &s;uch Animo&s;ities and Divi&s;ions, do more Mi&s;chief to their
Coun|try, than foreign Enemies. No Fears of Arbi|trary Government can
ju&s;tify, no Zeal for Re|ligion can &s;anctify, &s;uch Proceedings. To live
and die with their King, is the highe&s;t Profe&s;&s;i|on a Subject can make,
and he &s;erves his Coun|try be&s;t, who well &s;erves his King. And truly I am
per&s;waded, that many Men entred into <PB N="52" REF="73"> our
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Rebellion, who little thought of any &s;uch thing, at their
fir&s;t &s;etting out, but were ea&s;ily drawn in, by entering into the
So|ciety of evil Men, and were not guilty of &s;uch black Intentions, and were
led away with the common Error and fal&s;e Pre&s;umptions, that no|thing was at
the Bottom, but to &s;ettle the true Intere&s;t of the Nation, and &s;o fight
for the King and Parliament together, which they thought was their Duty; but
being once engaged, they went ra&s;hly farther than they at fir&s;t intended:
But a true Chri&s;tian Zeal will not &s;uffer us to tran&s;gre&s;s the &s;trict
Bounds of our Duty, both to God and the King, whatever flattering Pro|&s;pect
of Advantage it may give. <HI>Omne in prae|cipiti vitium &s;tetit:</HI> When
Men once e&s;pou&s;e an ill Party, like tho&s;e running down a Hill, they
cannot &s;top when they will; and I really believe, that &s;ome Pro&s;elytes
were made, who at fir&s;t abhorred the Thoughts of Trea&s;on and Rebellion, but
were merely &s;educed by the In&s;i|nuation and Addre&s;s of &s;ome bu&s;y
Factors for Sedition and Rebellion: And therefore wi&s;e Men &s;hould take Care
of li&s;tning to any Su&s;pi|cion of their Prince, and not to hear with
Plea&s;ure any &s;candalous Reflections of him; for he that can with Content
hear his King vilified, will &s;oon think him not fit to be a King. And tho' we
do not think at fir&s;t to be turning Re|bels, yet what&s;oever is at fir&s;t
but a Tending to|wards it, proves &s;o at la&s;t, there being more Danger, that
the Beginnings of Vice &s;hould corrupt us, than any Hope that a &s;ound
Di&s;po|&s;ition <PB N="53" REF="74"> &s;hould correct the Influence of &s;uch
a Vice.</P>
<P>At this Time a great Diffidence began betwixt the Court and the
Country Party in Parliament, and the Di&s;advantage lay altogether on the
King's Side, who had then &s;uch Coun&s;ellours as did not do their Duty; and
&s;o the Head and Members of our Monarchy entred into Di&s;tru&s;t of each
other, which filled the Kingdom with Confu&s;ions, Mi&s;eries, and infinite
De&s;olations. The King had then no Coun&s;ellours about him, or at lea&s;t did
not tru&s;t them that had the lea&s;t Con&s;ideration for his Honour, or
Friend&s;hip for them that &s;at at the Helm of Affairs; and the King had no
Coun&s;ellours but tho&s;e that made fal&s;e Steps: There was no hone&s;t Man
that dur&s;t &s;peak his Con&s;cience to the King, for fear of his Ruine, and
tho&s;e that the King thought mo&s;t true to him, betrayed him every Hour; and
his very Whi&s;pers in his Bed-cham|ber were pre&s;ently conveyed to them
again&s;t whom tho&s;e Whi&s;pers were: So that the King had very few to whom
he could breathe his Plaints, that were not &s;uborned again&s;t him, or
aver&s;e to his Opinions: And that King can ne|ver be a great Monarch, who hath
not ju&s;t and wi&s;e Coun&s;ellours, by whom he mu&s;t inform his Rea&s;on,
and guide his Actions, and u&s;e the Service and Indu&s;try of the be&s;t and
wi&s;e&s;t Men.</P>
<P>It was about this Time that the Parliament avowed publickly that
the Power was entirely in them, and that the King being &s;ever'd from 
<PB N="54" REF="75"> them, had no Royal Power in him; and the Hou&s;e of
Commons did then petition the King touching their Privileges, declaring the
King ought to take no Notice of any Debate in either Hou&s;e of Parliament, but
by Information from them, nor be di&s;plea&s;ed with any Debate, be|fore it was
pre&s;ented to him; the Members of Parliament being the &s;ole Judges of their
own Errors, in Matters depending before them. Many Members thought the Petition
was too rough, but the general Fate of things then drove that Way, to
increa&s;e the Jealou&s;y be|twixt the King and his People; and the Parlia|ment
declared, they would not proceed in any Affairs, till they had a &s;atisfactory
An&s;wer to their Petition. The King, before any An&s;wer given, withdraws to
<HI>Hampton Court,</HI> which in|crea&s;es the Di&s;contents in Parliament, who
&s;ent a Committee to him at <HI>Hampton Court,</HI> to tell the King plainly,
that the whole Frame of Go|vernment was out of Order, and a Remon|&s;trance was
prepared by the Parliament, very roughly penn'd, both for Matter and
Expre&s;&s;i|ons in it, wherein were mentioned all the Mi|&s;takes,
Misfortunes, Illegalities, and Defaults of Government, with an Enumeration of
all Grievances, and not one &s;ingle Error in Go|vernment omitted, nor any
pa&s;&s;ionate Exerci&s;e of Power, from the Death of King <HI>James,</HI> till
that time; and that they had no Hopes of &s;et|ling the Di&s;tractions of the
Kingdom, by rea|&s;on of the evil Coun&s;ellours, and malignant Party that were
about the King. And when this <PB N="55" REF="76"> Remon&s;trance was read in
the Hou&s;e, &s;ome mo|derate Members did then prote&s;t again&s;t it, and were
&s;ent to the <HI>Tower</HI> for it, but they were &s;oon after relea&s;ed.
Soon after this, the King came again to <HI>Whitehall,</HI> and being informed,
that &s;ome Members of Parliament had private Meetings and Corre&s;pondence
with the <HI>Scots,</HI> and countenanced the late Tumults, which came from the
City to <HI>Whitehall,</HI> and which cau&s;ed the King's Removal to
<HI>Hampton Court:</HI> The King, upon this Information, gave a War|rant to
&s;eal up their Trunks, Studies, and Pa|pers; upon which the Commons having
Notice, pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal Votes again&s;t it, and ju&s;tified their Members.
Whereupon the King exhibi|ted Articles again&s;t the five Members (which were
named) for endeavouring to &s;ubvert the fundamental Laws and Government, and
to deprive the King of his Regal Power. The King taking Notice, that the
Hou&s;e of Com|mons would defend their Members, went &s;ud|denly the next
Morning, with his Guard of Pen&s;ioners, entered the Hou&s;e of Commons,
&s;tept into the Speaker's Chair, and look'd round the Hou&s;e for the Members,
who having had Notice of the King's Coming, were gone; the King &s;aid, he was
&s;orry for the Occa&s;ion of his Coming thither, having &s;ent the Day before
a Sergeant at Arms to apprehend &s;ome that were accu&s;ed of High Trea&s;on,
whereunto he expe|cted Obedience (and not a Me&s;&s;age, as they had &s;ent
him) and he &s;aid, no King was ever more careful of their Privileges; but,
that <PB N="56" REF="77"> in Ca&s;es of High-Trea&s;on, no Per&s;on had a
Privilege; and therefore commanded the Spea|ker to &s;end them to him; who
replied, that he had neither Eyes to &s;ee, nor Tongue to &s;peak in that
Place, but as the Hou&s;e &s;hould direct him: And &s;o the King returned to
<HI>Whitehall.</HI> This Action of the King's was look'd upon as a great Breach
of their Privileges, and was judged extreamly prejudicial to the King, and much
to his Enemies Advantage, and was thought ve|ry &s;trange by tho&s;e who had
any Knowledge in publick Affairs, that the King was advi&s;ed to &s;o an
intemperate an Action, and many Excu&s;es were made for it, and &s;aid it was
done by Wo|mens Coun&s;el, that the King &s;hould not &s;uffer him&s;elf to be
&s;o baffled, which provoked him to it. Many of the King's Friends re&s;ented
his going to the Hou&s;e, as a Motion ri&s;ing rather from Pa&s;&s;ion than
Rea&s;on, being not guided with &s;uch Di&s;cretion as the Touchine&s;s of
tho&s;e Times required. Upon this the Hou&s;e of Commons frame a Declaration,
That the King's Coming to the Hou&s;e in a warlike Manner, to the Terror of the
Parliament, was a high Breach of their Privileges, and incon&s;i&s;tent with
their Liberty, and that they could not &s;it &s;afely without a Guard, for
which they had been Suitors to the King, but could not obtain it. Upon this
great Tumults were in the City, and at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI>; and as the
King went through the City, great Tumults flocked about his Coach, be&s;eeching
him to agree with his Parliament. The King being in Danger of the&s;e Tumults,
was coun|&s;elled <PB N="57" REF="78"> to remove again to <HI>Hampton
Court,</HI> which he did, and took with him the Queen, Prince of
<HI>Wales,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>York</HI>; which was much wondred at by
prudent Men, that the King &s;hould leave the Place of his Re&s;idence, which
brought great Di&s;advantage upon him&s;elf and his Affairs. But the Fear of
tho&s;e with him, and his own Fears for them, occa&s;ioned by the Tumults, with
the Hopes, that, by his Ab&s;ence, the Heat of the Parliament might in &s;ome
Mea&s;ure abate, were alledged, to ex|cu&s;e his Maje&s;ty's Retiring. But, on
the other Side, no Rea&s;on can be given for Rebellion, but Pretences; for
where Monarchy is &s;etled, as in <HI>England,</HI> the Re&s;pect due to it
could not be violated, without being guilty of a kind of Sacrilege; it being
not only a Re&s;emblance of that Power which God hath given the King, but a
Participation of that Power which none can re&s;i&s;t, without the Breach of
God's Com|mand. But People, at this time, were willing to be led blindfold by
their own Repre&s;enta|tives, rather than be guided by their Prince; and a few
&s;ubtle Heads in a Hou&s;e of Commons are dangerous, when they oppo&s;e the
Royal Autho|rity, and are backed by the Multitude. Some Men &s;oftly in&s;till
the Venom of their Princi|ples, and bring about their Ends, by in&s;inua|ting
them&s;elves into publick Affairs, and their Complaints &s;ometimes &s;eem
plau&s;ible, that they may gain Pro&s;elytes to their Faction, who may not mean
&s;o ill as their Leaders do. For, with what plau&s;ible Pretences were many
Thou&s;ands <PB N="58" REF="79"> fir&s;t engaged in the War again&s;t King
<HI>Charles!</HI> What more plau&s;ible, than to engage in a War for the
Defence of King and Parliament! It is the Con&s;titution of our Government, and
we were happy, if we had well under&s;tood it, where our Laws are propounded by
our &s;elves in Parliament, and ratified by our Kings, which is our proper
Freedom, as <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> and from the due Execution of tho&s;e Laws
ari&s;es our Safety: But cunning and ambitious Men in the Hou&s;e of Commons,
who framed the Platform of all our Mi&s;eries, fixed the odious Name of
<HI>Malignants</HI> upon all tho&s;e that adhered to the King, and the known
Laws, and who would not run to the &s;ame Exce&s;s of Madne&s;s and Re|bellion
with them. And I well remember the time, when Parliament Soldiers plundered the
Hou&s;es, and took away the Hor&s;es of hone&s;t Countrymen, who liv'd
peaceably at Home, only becau&s;e they were call'd Malignants, and that Name
did warrant the Plunder. The Ef|fects of the&s;e Complaints brought that Civil
War upon us in 1641; and the Decoy to en|gage Men then was, to fight for King
and Par|liament, but the War ended in the Ruine of both, when Subjects bathed
their Swords in the Blood of their King; a Murder committed by the Mockery of
Ju&s;tice, never to be forgot|ten, and yet never to be mentioned, without
Horror and Dete&s;tation! 'Tis true, that Offen|ces are given and taken in all
Governments; Kings &s;it unea&s;y on their Thrones, where their People are
tumultuous, and Religion is di&s;gra|ced; <PB N="59" REF="80"> and God hath
exerci&s;ed our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Na|tion with a various Face of Afflictions
in the la&s;t Age: Our Fears and Jealou&s;ies did even anticipate our
Mi&s;eries, and we oftentimes brought real Mi&s;eries upon our &s;elves, by
ha&s;t|ning to prevent the fancied ones. But when cunning Men de&s;ign
again&s;t the Government they live under, 'tis plain they would be Go|vernours
them&s;elves, and they murmur at Mer|cies, as <HI>I&s;rael</HI> did at
<HI>Manna,</HI> and their Hearts open and &s;hut according to their own Rules,
when they &s;train at Gnats, and &s;wallow Ca|mels, like the
<HI>Neopolitan</HI> Shepherd, who going to his Confe&s;&s;or at
<HI>Ea&s;ter,</HI> nothing &s;o much troubled his Con&s;cience, as that he had
ta&s;ted a little Cream the <HI>Lent</HI> before; but he had often robbed and
murdered Pa&s;&s;engers in the Mountains, which troubled not his Con&s;cience,
becau&s;e his Father and Grandfather had fol|lowed that Trade before.</P>
<P>The Truth is, the Power of King <HI>Charles</HI> (after his
&s;trange Conde&s;cen&s;ion, to let the Par|liament &s;it as long as they
plea&s;ed) was little more than imaginary. The Crown of <HI>England</HI> gives
no proper Strength to them that wear it, if per&s;onal Force be not
proportioned to their Station; which, if it reached as far as Prero|gative, it
would be a mighty Advantage, for then a Monarch might be &s;ure; but as this
unhappy King's Ca&s;e &s;tood, his Empire con&s;i|&s;ted chiefly in his
Submi&s;&s;ion to other Mens Wills, which was, in a Manner, but reigning by
Courte&s;y: And therefore the Affections of <PB N="60" REF="81"> the People is
generally the &s;tronge&s;t, but not the be&s;t Title, as we have often &s;een
and felt in <HI>England,</HI> in the la&s;t and this Age. Where|fore, all
Degrees of Inferiority &s;hould be ten|derly u&s;ed; for, if they be trampled
upon, they will certainly grow &s;owre and &s;tubborn, believing they have a
Right to be always well u&s;ed: And the lea&s;t Grievances &s;ugge&s;t
muti|nous Thoughts in them, and they pre&s;ently run up their Pedigree to
<HI>Adam,</HI> &s;aying, <HI>In the Beginning it was not &s;o.</HI> And thus
the Hou&s;e of Commons &s;erved King <HI>Charles,</HI> being full of dutiful
Affections and Expre&s;&s;ions, and abounded with large Promi&s;es of what
Demon|&s;trations of Duty they would &s;hortly make him, in acknowledging his
Royal Favour and Prote|ction to be a great Ble&s;&s;ing to them, and
Pre|&s;ervation of their Liberties and Privileges; when any of which were
infringed, they were found humbly to appeal to his Ju&s;tice for Redre&s;s, the
Rights and Privileges of Parliament not be|ing only their Birth-right and
Inheritance, but of the whole Kingdom; one of which Privileges undoubtedly was,
that the whole Right of the Revenue, upon the Book of Rates, was the People's,
and proceeded only from his Subjects Gifts; and then they inflicted &s;evere
Penalties upon tho&s;e that &s;hould pre&s;ume, for the future, to collect
them, or to rai&s;e any Money, but as the Parliament &s;hould grant and
appoint: By which Means the King was expo&s;ed to all the Dangers that might
happen, either at Home or Abroad, and al&s;o deprived of the Po&s;&s;ibility of
<PB N="61" REF="82"> &s;upporting the Government it &s;elf, and was thereby
reduced to a more helple&s;s Condition, than the meane&s;t of his Subjects, by
their un|worthy Votes, and unwarrantable Proceedings. Thus the Hou&s;e of
Commons &s;erved the King, and did then farther declare, that tho' the Power of
the Militia was wholly in the King, yet the Power of the Money was &s;olely in
them; and that without the Power of the Mo|ney, to pay the Soldiers, the Power
of the Militia could be of little Force: So that unle&s;s the King and the
Hou&s;e of Commons agreed, the Sword mu&s;t be left in the Scabbard. They then
al&s;o declared, That the King's Coming to the Hou&s;e, and the Speech he made
there, was a great Breach; and therefore de&s;ired he would name the Per&s;ons
that advi&s;ed and induced him to that Action, that they might be puni&s;hed,
this being the only Way to procure a firm Con|fidence and Amity betwixt the
King and his People.</P>
<P>In An&s;wer to this, the King conjured them by all the Obligations
of Love, Duty, and Obedience, to remove all their Doubts and Fears, and that
doing &s;o, he did not doubt but God would render him a Great and Glorious
Prince, and them a free and happy People. But to all the&s;e Offers he had
mo&s;t un&s;uitable Returns; &s;o that then the King perceived plain|ly, that
the Hou&s;e of Commons were by De|grees &s;tealing &s;o much Power into their
own Hands, that they did not care what remained in his: For they had got the
Art of impo&s;ing <PB N="62" REF="83"> upon the People's Under&s;tandings,
again&s;t their own Rea&s;on, and per&s;waded them they were in Danger of
Inva&s;ion, when the King was not only in Peace with all Chri&s;tendom, but
even tho&s;e Princes that were in War de&s;ired his A&s;&s;i|&s;tance: And his
Maje&s;ty was &s;o moved with tho&s;e odious Imputations (which had mo&s;t
per|nicious Effects upon the Minds of his People) that he was forced to comply
with many things contrary to his Judgment, to obviate greater Inconveniencies,
which were likely to ri&s;e again&s;t him, by tho&s;e fal&s;e and &s;candalous
Sug|ge&s;tions: And therefore he often an&s;wered their &s;editious and
undutiful Expre&s;&s;ions, with too much Gentlene&s;s and Conde&s;cen&s;ion,
thinking that Way to undeceive them, and thereby to re&s;tore them to their
Under&s;tandings, before they could be awakened to their Duty due to their
Sovereign, the King believing he was to &s;toop to all Arts and Means for that
Purpo&s;e. But herein he was ill advi&s;ed, and took fal&s;e Mea&s;ures; for
tho' the Proceedings of the Hou&s;e of Commons, and the Tumults rai&s;ed by
them, were the highe&s;t Affront to his Maje&s;ty, yet the Hou&s;e of Peers was
then in a tractable Temper, and with a little Patience might have been brought
to bla&s;t all the Extravagancies of the Hou&s;e of Commons. But other
Re&s;oluti|ons were then taken, which proved fatal to the King and Kingdom. It
is true, the Votes, and Affronts of the Hou&s;e of Commons were great, and the
Tumults al&s;o, but the Hou&s;e of Lords was then well di&s;po&s;ed, and if
managed by the <PB N="63" REF="84"> King with a little Patience, the Higher
Hou&s;e had bla&s;ted all the Extravagancies of the Low|er Hou&s;e, which, at
that Time, were the At|tempts of Per&s;ons in De&s;pair, and the Strug|lings of
Men at the la&s;t Ga&s;p: And if the King would have been only a Spectator of
the Di|vi&s;ion between the two Hou&s;es, and &s;o have encouraged the Lords,
who were firm to the King, the Commons would have been brought within their due
Limits; but the King thought, by his Gentlene&s;s and ea&s;y Carriage, to
recover his Subjects to their Sobriety, before they would be apprehen&s;ive of
their Duty, and by that Way undid all. The Truth is, the King's Pa&s;&s;ing the
Bill again&s;t the Bi&s;hops, was a great Weakening of his Party, not only by
lo&s;ing &s;o many Voices in the Lords Hou&s;e, but it much influenced tho&s;e,
(who&s;e Minds were then in Su&s;pen&s;e) to &s;ee Foundations &s;haken.
Be&s;ides, they that knew well the King's Di&s;po&s;ition, did believe nothing
could have prevailed with him to pa&s;s &s;o Antimonarchical an Act, and
there|fore could never after be &s;ure the King would deny any thing that was
importunately a&s;ked: And &s;o either &s;ome withdrew them&s;elves from
tho&s;e Con&s;ultations, that they might decline the Danger of Envy, by
contradicting them, or el&s;e &s;uffered them&s;elves patiently to be car|ried
on by the Stream, and to agree to any thing that was lu&s;tily attempted. But
truly, I think nothing ought to di&s;courage publick Spirits from contributing
all they can to the Firmne&s;s of &s;uch Coun&s;els, as they e&s;teem mo&s;t
ju&s;t and &s;afe <PB N="64" REF="85"> for the publick Good, and not to
withdraw them&s;elves upon any Pretence. Certainly the King was here
overper&s;waded to agree with the Parliament in this Act again&s;t Bi&s;hops,
that &s;o for the future he might be able to deny them nothing; and this
Conde&s;cen&s;ion of his Maje|&s;ty was very &s;urprizing to the whole Kingdom,
and much blamed by all, but only tho&s;e who had a Hand in per&s;wading the
King to it.</P>
<P>It was then indeed a &s;ad Pro&s;pect, to &s;ee the melancholy
Condition the King was in, &s;unk, in a few Days, from the Heighth of all
Great|ne&s;s, which made his Enemies before to fear him, to &s;uch a Degree of
Lowne&s;s, that his own Servants dur&s;t hardly come near him. He then
perceived (when it was too late) that his Granting more than ever Prince had
done, had encouraged the People to a&s;k more than ever Subjects had demanded;
and yet the King de|clared, if he knew the particular Grounds of his Subjects
Fears, he would mo&s;t gladly apply &s;uitable Remedies, and de&s;ired they
would not, out of Apprehen&s;ion of po&s;&s;ible Dangers, throw his Maje&s;ty
and them&s;elves into real and pre&s;ent Inconveniencies; and that they would
pur&s;ue &s;uch Methods as might re&s;tore Felicity both to King and People.
The King farther a&s;&s;ured the Hou&s;e of Commons, That he would &s;atisfy
all their ju&s;t Demands, by retracting any thing he had done, which &s;eemed
but to intrench upon their Privileges, and hoped they would have the &s;ame
Regard to his Honour and Reputation, with that of his Subjects: But
what&s;oever the <PB N="65" REF="86"> King &s;aid or promi&s;ed, &s;ignified
little with the Parliament: For then both Hou&s;es declared, they were the
&s;upreme Judicature of the King|dom; and when they had declared what the Law
of the Land was, to have it di&s;puted or contradicted, (tho' by the King's
Command) was a Breach of Privilege, and not to be obey|ed; which was to
declare, in plain Terms, that a Vote of the two Hou&s;es was obligatory to all
without; (tho' again&s;t his Maje&s;ty's Con|&s;ent) which Re&s;olve did
ab&s;olutely annull the Laws of the Land, and Liberty of the Subject, and let
all &s;ober Men &s;ee, that the fatal Period of both was near an End, and that
a Founda|tion was then laid for Anarchy, which &s;oon followed.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t not forget to &s;ay, that a little be|fore the War
was declared, the Queen went with the Prince&s;s <HI>Mary</HI> her Daughter, to
the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> her Hu&s;band, and was ac|companied by the King
to <HI>Dover,</HI> from whence the King returned to <HI>Greenwich,</HI> and
&s;ent for the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> and the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> to go
with him towards <HI>York,</HI> where he was well received. The Parliament
&s;ent after him the nineteen Propo&s;itions, which were treated on, and
refu&s;ed by the King. But I will not omit one Pa&s;&s;age at
<HI>Greenwich,</HI> before the King left it, which was &s;omewhat &s;trange and
ominous; which was thus. The King commanded his Statue to be carried from
<HI>Greenwich</HI> Garden into the Magazine: In the Carriage of it, the Face
being upwards, a Swallow, or &s;ome other <PB N="66" REF="87"> Bird, flying
over it, dunged in the Face of the King's Statue, which was wiped off
immediate|ly by tho&s;e that carried it; but notwith&s;tanding all Endeavours,
it could not be gotten off, but turned into Blood. This Statue was made at
<HI>Rome,</HI> by the famous Statuary Signor <HI>Bernino</HI>; and when the
King's Picture was brought to him, by which he was to make the Statue, with
po|&s;itive Directions to conceal who&s;e Picture it was, Signor
<HI>Bernino,</HI> after having look'd &s;ome|time very &s;tedfa&s;tly upon it,
&s;aid, he had never &s;een any Picture, who&s;e Face &s;hewed &s;o much
Greatne&s;s, and withal &s;uch Marks of Sadne&s;s and Misfortune, which proved
too true in all its Circum&s;tances; for never any King kept greater State or
Order in his Court, and was more maje&s;tick in keeping up his Dignity, till at
la&s;t he was made a &s;ad Spectacle both to Men and Angels, before his own
Palace.</P>
<P>But, leaving this Digre&s;&s;ion, it is Time to tell you, that
both Hou&s;es declared, the King|ly Prerogative, which was before lodged in the
Crown, tho' with &s;ome Limitations, was now no more there, but in the two
Hou&s;es of Par|liament: Whereas, by the Con&s;titution of the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Government, the King is &s;ingly Sove|reign, and no Power on
Earth co-ordinate with him: And as Almighty God is the ab&s;olute So|vereign of
all Princes, &s;o imperial Princes (as the Kings of <HI>England</HI> are
e&s;teemed) are ab&s;o|lute, next, and immediately under God, to whom alone
they are accountable. And there|fore tho&s;e that &s;et the Laws above the
Maker <PB N="67" REF="88"> of them, or &s;ubordinate Magi&s;trates above the
Fountain of the fir&s;t Power, u&s;urp upon the original Founder, and take upon
them to re|move the unchangeable Foundations of Power it &s;elf: For there is
no longer any Govern|ment, where the Inferior incroaches upon the Superior, and
confounds the Relations of Kings and Subjects, in that Anarchical Whim&s;ey of
imagining that Kings are to govern by Contract, and Subjects to obey
accordingly: Whereas no Man can &s;hew, that there ever was an Origi|nal
Contract between former Kings and the People of <HI>England,</HI> be&s;ides
that which was implied in the Con&s;titution; and the very Sup|po&s;ition of
one is repugnant to all our Laws, and expre&s;sly oppo&s;ite to the Words and
Sen&s;e of many of our Statutes; there being nothing more irreconcileable and
contradictory, than a Contract by which our Kings are made judici|ally
accountable to their People, or cen&s;urable for Mi&s;carriages in their
Government, when &s;everal Acts of Parliament do not only declare our Kings to
be unaccountable, but make it High Trea&s;on to take up Arms again&s;t them,
upon any Pretence what&s;oever. And, to ima|gine it either lawful or
practicable, to que&s;tion and depo&s;e Kings, without a Liberty of taking up
Arms again&s;t them, is a Contradiction that none will pretend to reconcile,
who are not Lunatick, or deeply Hypochondriacal: And as for that Contract in
our fir&s;t Con&s;titution, it only declares the Ends for which our Princes
were to Rule, <HI>viz.</HI> The Safety, Peace, and <PB N="68" REF="89">
Pro&s;perity of their People, to teach and in&s;truct them, that they were to
govern by Laws; but it no way promi&s;es, that they &s;hould be accoun|table to
their People, or arraigned by their Subjects, leaving them for that only
re&s;pon&s;ible to God, and in no manner puni&s;hable, but by the Stings of
their own Con&s;ciences: <HI>For who can &s;ay to the King, what doe&s;t
thou?</HI></P>
<P>About this Time the War was openly decla|red again&s;t the King,
after his being refu&s;ed Entrance into <HI>Hull</HI>; whereupon he went to
<HI>York.</HI> The Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> was named General for the
Parliament: the Earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> Ge|neral of the Hor&s;e: The Lord
<HI>Kimbolton, Sta|pleton, Balfour,</HI> and <HI>Ram&s;ey,</HI> General
Officers for the Parliament. Whereupon the King na|med the Earl of
<HI>Lind&s;ey</HI> Lord Chamberlain of <HI>England,</HI> to be his Lieutenant
General, Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> Cou&s;in to the King, General of the Hor&s;e,
Sir <HI>Jacob A&s;tley</HI> Major General of the Foot, and Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI>
Commi&s;&s;ary General of the Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus the War was began, and the King, by a very unhappy Accident,
was obliged to de|clare before he was in any Condition for Action. The
Occa&s;ion, This: Collonel <HI>Goring,</HI> Gover|nour of
<HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> declared for the King, before the King was ready to
march to his Suc|cour. Upon &s;ome private Su&s;picion the Par|liament had of
<HI>Goring,</HI> he was &s;ent for, and examined, and upon his Confe&s;&s;ion
of &s;ome things relating to the Army, the Lords <HI>Wilmot, A&s;hburnham</HI>
and <HI>Pollard,</HI> all three Members, <PB N="69" REF="90"> were expelled the
Hou&s;e of Commons, and &s;ent to &s;everal Pri&s;ons; but <HI>Peircy</HI> and
<HI>Jermyn,</HI> who were al&s;o Members accu&s;ed, e&s;caped. This
Confe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Goring</HI> gave him a great Reputa|tion with the
Parliament, who &s;ent him back to his Government with Money to pay the
Sol|diers, and to take Care of his Government. By his great Dexterity, he
per&s;waded the King, that he was not only &s;orry for the Fault he had
com|mitted, but that he would &s;oon redeem it by &s;ome &s;ignal Service to
the King; and he managed him|&s;elf with &s;uch Addre&s;s, that he received
Three Thou&s;and Pounds from the Queen, to fortify the Garri&s;on, when it
&s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary for him to declare for the King; and at the &s;ame
time he received a great Supply from the Parliament, for Payment of the
Garri&s;on, that it might be kept for their Service. Some time after, upon
&s;ome new Information, he was &s;ent for again, and appeared in the Hou&s;e,
and ju&s;tified him&s;elf with &s;o much Innocence and Unaffected|ne&s;s, that
the Hou&s;e of Commons, after an Apology for the Trouble they had given him,
commanded him to return to his Government, and to take great Care for the
Safety of the Place, which was of much Importance to them, and con&s;ented to
all he propo&s;ed in behalf of the Garri&s;on. In the mean time, he a&s;&s;ured
his Maje&s;ty, (by tho&s;e that were employed be|tween them) that in a &s;hort
time he &s;hould be in a Condition to declare for the King, when the King
&s;hould require it; but by the Sequel, we &s;hall find he was obliged to do
it, much <PB N="70" REF="91"> &s;ooner than he was prepared for it, tho' no
&s;ooner than he had Rea&s;on to expect it. It &s;eems, when the Lord
<HI>Kimbolton</HI> received his Commi&s;&s;ion to be Lieutenant General of the
Hor&s;e for the Parliament, <HI>Goring</HI> was appointed to be his
Major-General: But <HI>Goring</HI> wrote to his Lord&s;hip, de&s;iring he might
be excu&s;ed for his Attendance upon the Army, till it was rea|dy to march,
that he might be pre&s;ent in his Garri&s;on, till &s;ome Fortifications were
perfected, that were nece&s;&s;ary for that important Place: Upon which the
Lord <HI>Kimbolton</HI> prevailed with the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> that
<HI>Goring</HI> &s;hould not be &s;ent for, till they were ready to enter upon
Action; and, at la&s;t, upon &s;everal In&s;tances from the Lord
<HI>Kimbolton</HI> to General <HI>Goring,</HI> to come away, after &s;everal
Excu&s;es, he told him, he was advi&s;ed by Coun&s;el, that it was dange|rous
to leave the Place without the King's Leave, having received the Command of
that Place from him. Hereby the King received a con&s;i|derable Reputation,
that &s;o important a Place as <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> with &s;o con&s;iderable
an Officer as Collonel <HI>Goring,</HI> had declared for him: But his
declaring, before the King was ready, or the Garri&s;on in Condition to
&s;u&s;tain a Siege, was the Cau&s;e of the King's Re&s;olution of &s;etting up
his Standard; and the Lo&s;s of <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> which &s;oon happened,
gave a great Di&s;order to the King's Affairs: For the Parliament &s;ent
forthwith to be&s;iege it, and <HI>Goring</HI> was obliged to &s;urrender it,
upon very good Articles for him&s;elf, going into <HI>France</HI> with the
Money he <PB N="71" REF="92"> had received on both Sides, without making good
his Promi&s;e to either. But this his Car|riage was much re&s;ented by all the
King's Friends, and more particularly by tho&s;e who were expelled the Hou&s;e.
If his Con&s;cience and Integrity had equalled his Wit and Courage, he had been
one of the mo&s;t eminent Men of the Age he lived in: But he could not
re&s;i&s;t Temptations, and was a Man without Scruple, and loved no Man &s;o
well, but he would cozen him, and afterwards laugh at him, as he did at the
Lord <HI>Kimbolton</HI>; and of all his Qualifica|tions (which were many)
Di&s;&s;imulation was his Ma&s;ter-piece, in which he &s;o much excelled, with
his great Dexterity, &s;eeming Mode&s;ty and Unaffectedne&s;s, that in this
Concern, of <HI>Port&s;|mouth,</HI> he cozened the Hou&s;e of Commons twice,
where were many Per&s;ons not ea&s;ily to be deceived; neither were they
a&s;hamed to be cozened twice by him, who was &s;o perfect a Ma&s;ter in that
Art of Deceiving.</P>
<P>Upon this Incident, the King publi&s;hed a Declaration, wherein
all the in&s;olent and re|bellious Actions of both Hou&s;es were recited,
forbidding all his Subjects from paying any Obedience to them, and requiring
all that could bear Arms, to be pre&s;ent to &s;erve him at
<HI>Nottingham,</HI> the 24th of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> following, on which Day he
intended to &s;et up his Royal Stan|dard, where all his good Subjects were
obliged to attend. Many thought his Maje&s;ty had better have &s;et it up at
<HI>York:</HI> But the Inclina|tion the King had to be near <HI>London,</HI>
and his <PB N="72" REF="93"> Hopes of great Effects from <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI>
(which proved vain) made him prefer <HI>Notingham</HI>; and the Earl of
<HI>Cumberland</HI> was left Commander in Chief of <HI>York&s;hire,</HI>
a&s;&s;i&s;ted with Sir <HI>Thomas Glemham.</HI> Mo&s;t Per&s;ons in
<HI>York&s;hire</HI> were very faithful to the King, except the Lord
<HI>Fairfax</HI> and his Son, who were to be made Pri&s;oners; the Seizing of
them had probably prevented the Mi&s;chief which &s;oon after broke out in
tho&s;e Parts; but the King (being always ill ill advi&s;ed) could not admit
they &s;hould be made Pri&s;oners. The King came to <HI>Nottingham</HI> &s;ome
Days before his Standard was &s;et up, and hearing &s;ome Regiments, by Order
from the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> were marching to <HI>Coventry,</HI> the
King ha&s;tened thither with &s;ome Troops of Hor&s;e well armed, and got
thither the Day before the Parliament's Forces. However, the Gates were &s;hut
again&s;t him, and &s;ome of his Servants kill'd from the Walls. The King had
no Remedy for this Affront, but lodged that Night at <HI>Stonely Abbey,</HI> at
Sir <HI>Thomas Lee</HI>'s. The next Day the King's Body of Hor&s;e, being near
the Enemy at <HI>Southam,</HI> who were not above Twelve Hundred Foot, with one
Troop of Hor&s;e, in a free Campagne, yet they retired without being charged.
Commi&s;&s;ary <HI>Wilmot</HI> then commanded the King's Hor&s;e, and &s;everal
Reflections were made upon his not charging them. About this time I was with
the Earl of <HI>Northampton</HI> at <HI>Warwick,</HI> having left
<HI>Coventry</HI> &s;ome Months before, where I re&s;ided with my Father, being
then very young, and went with two Hor&s;es, <PB N="73" REF="94"> and one of
his Men, to the Earl of <HI>Northam|pton,</HI> who was Lord Lieutenant of
<HI>Warwick|&s;hire,</HI> with whom I was when he fir&s;t put the
Commi&s;&s;ion of Array in Execution at <HI>Cole&s;hill,</HI> eight Miles from
<HI>Coventry</HI> towards <HI>Bermingham.</HI> From thence we went to
<HI>Warwick,</HI> in Hopes to have &s;urprized that Ca&s;tle; but Sir
<HI>Edward Peito</HI> was gotten into it before, and had Orders to keep it for
the Lord <HI>Brook,</HI> who&s;e Ca&s;tle it was, and his Lord&s;hip was then
employed by the Par|liament, to &s;ettle the Militia in
<HI>Warwick&s;hire.</HI> The Ca&s;tle was &s;trong, and well &s;cituated, the
River <HI>Avon</HI> running by it. Our Endeavours for taking it, were to little
Purpo&s;e, for we had only two &s;mall Pieces of Cannon, which were brought
from <HI>Compton Hou&s;e,</HI> belonging to the Earl of <HI>Northampton,</HI>
and tho&s;e were drawn up to the Top of the Church Steeple, and were
di&s;charged at the Ca&s;tle, to which they could do no Hurt, but only frighted
them within the Ca&s;tle, who &s;hot into the Street, and killed &s;everal of
our Men. The King (as I &s;aid before) being repul|&s;ed from
<HI>Coventry,</HI> ha&s;tened back towards <HI>Not|tingham,</HI> and the Earl
of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> drawing near us with his Army, being then at
<HI>Southam,</HI> my Lord of <HI>Northampton,</HI> with his Troop of Gentlemen,
which were numerous, marched towards <HI>Wor|ce&s;ter,</HI> where we met Prince
<HI>Rupert</HI> with &s;ome Troops of Hor&s;e, with whom we joined, and drew up
in the Fields, not far from <HI>Powych</HI> Bridge, upon the <HI>Severn,</HI>
where we &s;tood very quietly for &s;ome time, being informed that the Earl of
<HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> was marching after us. We had <PB N="74" REF="95"> not been
long in this Po&s;ture, before &s;ome Troops of Hor&s;e, commanded by Collonel
<HI>Nathaniel Fiennes,</HI> who lay on the other Side <HI>Powych</HI> Bridge,
expecting to meet the Vanguard of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s Army, pa&s;&s;ed the
Bridge, and having pa&s;&s;ed the Defiles, he drew up his Troops not far from
ours, which the Prince gave him Time to do; but then the Prince charged and
routed them, and &s;ent them back over the Bridge, in great Confu&s;ion and
Di&s;order. In this Action we took &s;everal Pri&s;oners, among&s;t whom was
one Collonel <HI>Sandys,</HI> who was mortally woun|ded, and died &s;ome Hours
after. Major <HI>Dou|gla&s;s,</HI> and &s;everal others, were killed upon the
Place. This was the fir&s;t Action I was ever in, and being upon an unruly
Hor&s;e, he ran away with me among&s;t the Enemy, while we pur&s;ued them to
the Bridge, in which Hurly I lo&s;t my Hat; but my Hor&s;e's Courage being
&s;omewhat abated, I &s;topp'd him before we came to the Bridge, and &s;o
returned with our own Troops. We retired that Evening into the City of
<HI>Wor|ce&s;ter,</HI> where being refre&s;hed, we marched that Night towards
<HI>Ludlow,</HI> where we &s;tayed &s;ome time; and from thence we went to
<HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> where we &s;tay'd till the King came thither with his
Army, which much increa&s;ed in tho&s;e Quarters, by &s;everal Regiments newly
rai&s;ed in tho&s;e Parts for the King. The next Day after our leaving
<HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> came thither with his
Army, and made that City his Head Quarters for &s;ome time. The King &s;tay'd
at <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> till his Army was well recruited, <PB N="75" REF="96">
and then Re&s;olutions were taken to march to|wards <HI>London,</HI> in Hopes
to get thither before the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> who was then, with the
Par|liament Army, about <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Warwick.</HI></P>
<P>While the King &s;tay'd about <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> his Army was
modelled into &s;everal Regiments of Hor&s;e, Foot, and Dragoons, which, in
all, made a con&s;iderable Body: The Hor&s;e were put into &s;everal Brigades,
the Foot into Tertia's (as they were then called) and we had Three or Four
Regiments of Dragoons: Our chief Want was Arms; for mo&s;t of the Regiments,
which were rai&s;ed in <HI>Wales,</HI> were very ill armed. However, they were
brave and re&s;olute to &s;erve their King, with &s;uch Arms as they had, or
could get in their March, and our Army increa|&s;ed daily, by many coming to us
from all Parts, as we marched. From <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> we marched thro' Part
of <HI>Stafford&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Warwick&s;hire:</HI> I was then with the
Earl of <HI>Northampton,</HI> in his own Troop, which con&s;i&s;ted of One
Hun|dred Gentlemen of Quality. The Lord <HI>Com|pton,</HI> elde&s;t Son to the
Earl, was the Right|hand Man; Sir <HI>Charles Compton,</HI> his &s;econd Son,
was Cornet; and Mr. <HI>Arden,</HI> a Gentleman of one of the mo&s;t ancient
Families in <HI>War|wick&s;hire,</HI> was Lieutenant to the Earl. We were then
put into the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI>'s Re|giment of Hor&s;e, which
con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ix gallant Troops, be&s;ides the Servants: The Prince of
<HI>Wales</HI>'s own Troop commanded by Sir <HI>Thomas Byron,</HI> who was
Collonel of the Regiment, with Sir <HI>Thomas Daniel</HI> Lieutenant, and Mr.
<HI>Mettham</HI> <PB N="76" REF="97"> of <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> Cornet: The Duke
of <HI>York</HI>'s Troop, commanded by the Lord <HI>Aubigny,</HI> Brother to
the Duke of <HI>Richmond:</HI> The Earl of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI>'s Troop,
commanded by his Bro|ther Collonel <HI>Cavendi&s;h:</HI> The Earl of
<HI>Lind&s;ey</HI>'s Troop, commanded by his Son the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI>
of <HI>Eresby:</HI> The Earls of <HI>Northam|pton</HI> and
<HI>We&s;tmoreland</HI> commanded each their own Troop; and all the Servants of
the whole Regiment were put into one Troop, comman|ded by Captain
<HI>Davi&s;on,</HI> an old experienced Low-Country Soldier, who was recommended
for that Employ, by the old Earl of <HI>Nor|thampton.</HI></P>
<P>We marched thro' a great Part of <HI>Warwick|&s;hire,</HI> and
came under <HI>Wormington</HI> Hills, on <HI>Saturday</HI> in the Evening, the
Twenty Second Day of <HI>October,</HI> 1642. The King lodged that Night, at Sir
<HI>William Chancie</HI>'s, at <HI>Ratott</HI> Bridge, and Prince
<HI>Rupert</HI> at the Lord <HI>Spen|cer</HI>'s, at <HI>Wormleighton.</HI> The
Prince of <HI>Wales</HI>'s Regiment, in which we were, was quartered in two or
three Villages under <HI>Wormington</HI> Hills, When it was dark, we &s;aw
&s;everal Fires not far from us, and &s;ending out a Party to &s;ee, we were
&s;oon informed, that the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> was there with his whole
Army, and quartered at <HI>Keinton,</HI> a Market-Town. Whereupon our whole
Regiment drew into the Fields, and had Provi|&s;ions brought us from the
Villages, and we forthwith gave Notice to the King and Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI>
and &s;oon after we received Orders to be upon our Guard all Night, and to be
the <PB N="77" REF="98"> next Morning by Eight, at the Rendezvous upon
<HI>Wormington</HI> Hills. The King, with the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and
Duke of <HI>York,</HI> came &s;oon after, and Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> who
called a general Council of War, where it was debated, whether to march towards
<HI>London,</HI> or to march back, and fight the Enemy, whom we &s;aw from the
Hill, embattelling their Army in the Bottom near <HI>Keinton.</HI> To march
from them was thought di&s;honourable, as if we feared them, and they would be
&s;ure to follow, and give us continual Trouble in our March, when we &s;hould
not, perhaps, find &s;o good Occa&s;ion to fight them; and &s;o it was
re&s;olved, that we &s;hould go down the Hill and attack them. Whereupon great
Preparations were made, and Precautions taken, for de&s;cending the Hill, which
was very &s;teep and long, and had been impracticable, if the Enemy had drawn
nearer to the Bottom of it; but we &s;aw by the Ranging their Army, that they
intended to &s;tay there for us, having a good Market Town by them, and not far
from <HI>Warwick.</HI> In the fir&s;t Place, it was re&s;olved, that Collonel
<HI>Wa&s;hington,</HI> with his Regiment of Dragoons, &s;hould de&s;cend the
Hill, and po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome Inclo&s;ures and Briars on the right Hand of our
Army, and a forlorn Hope of Six Hun|dred Hor&s;e were ordered likewi&s;e to
de&s;cend be|fore the Army, and the Carriage Hor&s;es of the Cannon were put
behind the Carriages, excepting a Hor&s;e or two before, and the Foot were
orde|red to de&s;cend as well as they could. The King was that Day in a black
Velvet Coat lin'd <PB N="78" REF="99"> with Ermin, and a Steel Cap covered with
Vel|vet. He rode to every Brigade of Hor&s;e, and to all the Tertia's of Foot,
to encourage them to their Duty, being accompanied by the great Officers of the
Army: His Maje&s;ty &s;poke to them with great Courage and Chearfulne&s;s,
which cau&s;ed Huzza's thro' the whole Army. I take the Liberty here to
remember one Pa&s;|&s;age which was remarkable. It &s;eems, that very Morning,
before the Army de&s;cended the Hill, the Duke of <HI>Lenox</HI> (being
returned from his Travels) waited then upon the King, by whom his Grace was
very well received and care&s;&s;ed. He brought with him one Mr.
<HI>Scroop,</HI> who had accompanied him. After this Gentle|man had ki&s;&s;ed
the King's Hand, as al&s;o that of the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> and Duke of
<HI>York,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Lenox</HI> told the King, that the Gen|tleman's
Father was Sir <HI>Gerva&s;e Scroop,</HI> who had a good E&s;tate, had rai&s;ed
a Foot Regiment in <HI>Lincoln&s;hire,</HI> to &s;erve his Maje&s;ty, and was
then in the Army, but very angry with his Son, and would not &s;ee him, or be
reconciled to him, becau&s;e he went with the Duke of <HI>Lenox,</HI> without
his Father's Con&s;ent, and had &s;pent much more Money than he allowed him.
The Duke of <HI>Lenox</HI> therefore prayed the King to make them Friends.
Whereupon the King &s;ent for the Father, and told him, it was his Plea|&s;ure
he &s;hould be reconciled to his Son, who being then pre&s;ent, demanded upon
his Knees his Father's Ble&s;&s;ing; whereupon the Father gave it him, and
&s;aid thus to his Son: <HI>I am</HI> <PB N="79" REF="100"> <HI>now going down
the Hill to &s;erve the King, and if I be killed, I have left you, my Son,
enough to &s;pend:</HI> And the Son pre&s;ently an&s;wered; <HI>And if I be
killed, I &s;hall leave you enough to pay for me.</HI> And &s;o the Father and
Son went down the Hill together; and it &s;o happened, that the Son &s;aved his
Father's Life, who ha|ving received many Wounds, was &s;tript, and left for
dead, and was brought off the next Morning by his Son, in one of the King's
Coaches, who lived &s;ome Years after, always very kind to his Son, and left
him a very good E&s;tate. I have pre&s;umed to add this Particular, becau&s;e I
have had great Obligations to that Family; and upon King <HI>Charles</HI> II.'s
Re&s;tora|tion, he was made Knight of the <HI>Bath,</HI> by the Name of Sir
<HI>Adrian Scroop:</HI> And I was then one of the Gentlemen that brought him to
the King, when his Maje&s;ty put the Red Ribband about him. But, leaving this
Digre&s;&s;ion, let us turn again to the King's Army, which, about Ten in the
Morning, began to de&s;cend the Hill, the Foot getting down &s;everal Ways
which the Hor&s;e could not do, by rea&s;on of the Hill's Steepne&s;s. When the
whole Army was down, and drawn into Order, the King de&s;ired the Earl of
<HI>Lind&s;ey,</HI> who was his Lieutenant General, that he would permit
General <HI>Ruthen,</HI> an old <HI>Scotch</HI> Officer, and who had long
&s;erved under <HI>Gu&s;tavus Adolphus,</HI> the late King of <HI>Sweden,</HI>
and had been a Lieutenant General in his Ar|my, to draw up his Maje&s;ty's Army
that Day, and to command it, being an old experienced <PB N="80" REF="101">
General; to which the Earl of <HI>Lind&s;ey</HI> (being wholly made of
Obedience) willingly complied, and &s;aid he would &s;erve the King that Day,
as Collonel of the King's Royal Regiment of Foot Guards, which he did,
accompanied by his Son, the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> of <HI>Eresby.</HI> The
Enemy had all the Morning to draw up their Army, in a great plain Field, which
they did to their be&s;t Advantage, by putting &s;everal Bodies of Foot with
Retrenchments and Can|non before them, and all their Foot were lined with
Hor&s;e behind them, with Intervals betwixt each Body, for their Hor&s;e to
enter, if need required; and upon their right Wing were &s;ome Briars covered
with Dragoons, and a little be|hind, on their left Wing, was the Town of
<HI>Keinton,</HI> which &s;upplied them with Provi&s;ions, and where their
Baggage and Carriages were.</P>
<P>Our whole Army was drawn up in a Body, the Hor&s;e Three deep in
each Wing, and the Foot in the Center Six deep. The Prince of <HI>Wales</HI>'s
Regiment was on the right Wing, which was commanded by Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI>
and Collo|nel <HI>Wa&s;hington</HI> was with his Dragoons upon our Right. In
the Center was the Infantry, com|manded in chief by General <HI>Ruthen,</HI>
and un|der him, by Sir <HI>Jacob A&s;tley.</HI> The Earl of <HI>Lind&s;ey</HI>
marched on Foot, in the Head of the Regiment of the Royal Foot Guards, with his
Son, the Lord <HI>Willoughby,</HI> and Sir <HI>Edmond Verney</HI> carried the
Royal Standard. The left Wing of our Hor&s;e was commanded by Com|mi&s;&s;ary
General <HI>Wilmot,</HI> with Collonel <HI>Fielding</HI> <PB N="81" REF="102">
and &s;ome other principal Officers; and Collonel <HI>George Li&s;le,</HI> with
Lieutenant Collonel <HI>Ennis,</HI> were in the left Wing, with a Regiment of
Dra|goons, to defend the Briars on that Side, and we had a Body of Re&s;erve,
of Six Hundred Hor&s;e, commanded by the Earl of <HI>Carnarvon.</HI> When our
Army was drawn up at the Foot of the Hill, and ready to march, all the Generals
went to the King (who intended to march with the Army) and de&s;i|red he would
retire to a ri&s;ing Ground, &s;ome Di|&s;tance from thence, on the Right, with
the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> and Duke of <HI>York</HI> (having his Guard of
Pen&s;ioners on Hor&s;eback with him) from whence he might &s;ee the I&s;&s;ue
of the Battle, and be out of Danger; and that otherwi&s;e the Army would not
advance towards the Enemy: To which the King (very unwillingly) was at la&s;t
per&s;waded.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t before we began our March, Prince <HI>Rupert</HI>
pa&s;&s;ed from one Wing to the other, gi|ving po&s;itive Orders to the
Hor&s;e, to march as clo&s;e as was po&s;&s;ible, keeping their Ranks with
Sword in Hand, to receive the Enemy's Shot, without firing either Carbin or
Pi&s;tol, till we broke in among&s;t the Enemy, and then to make u&s;e of our
Fire-Arms as need &s;hould require; which Order was punctually ob&s;erved. The
Enemy &s;tayed to receive us, in the &s;ame Po|&s;ture as was formerly
declared; and when we came within Cannon Shot of the Enemy, they di&s;charged
at us three Pieces of Cannon from their left Wing, commanded by Sir <HI>James
Ram|&s;ey;</HI> which Cannon mounted over our Troops, without doing any Hurt,
except that their &s;e|cond <PB N="82" REF="103"> Shot killed a
Quarter-Ma&s;ter in the Rear of the Duke of <HI>York</HI>'s Troop. We &s;oon
after engaged each other, and our Dragoons on our Right beat the Enemy from the
Briars, and Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> led on our right Wing &s;o furi|ou&s;ly,
that, after a &s;mall Re&s;i&s;tance, we forced their left Wing, and were
Ma&s;ters of their Can|non; and the Prince being extreamly eager of this
Advantage (which he better knew how to take, than to keep) was not content with
their Cannon, and keeping their Ground, but eager|ly pur&s;ued the Enemy, who
fled on the other Side of <HI>Keinton</HI> towards <HI>Warwick:</HI> And we of
the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI>'s Regiment, (who were all &s;cattered) pur&s;ued
al&s;o, till we met with two Foot Regiments of <HI>Hambden</HI> and
<HI>Hollis,</HI> and with a Regiment of Hor&s;e coming from <HI>Warwick</HI> to
their Army, which made us ha&s;ten as fa&s;t back as we had pur&s;ued. In this
Pur&s;uit I was wounded in the Head by a Per&s;on who turned upon me, and
&s;truck me with his Pole-axe, and was &s;econding his Blow, when Sir
<HI>Thomas Byron</HI> being near, he &s;hot him dead with his Pi&s;tol, by
which Means I came back. In fine, by meeting the&s;e three Regiments, we were
obli|ged to return back to our Army, and then found our great Error, in leaving
our Foot naked, who were rudely handled by the Enemy's Hor&s;e and Foot
together, in our Ab&s;ence, who fell principally upon the King's Royal Regiment
of Foot Guards, who lo&s;t Eleven of Thirteen Colours, the King's
Standard-Brearer, Sir <HI>Ed|mond Verney,</HI> killed, and the Royal Standard 
<PB N="83" REF="104"> taken, which was pre&s;ently retaken by Cap|tain <HI>John
Smith,</HI> who was Knighted for it that Night by the King, under the Standard
Royal, and made a Baronet with the u&s;ual Ceremonies; and had afterwards a
large Medal of Gold gi|ven him, with the King's Picture on the one Side, and
the Banner on the other, which he always wore to his dying Day, in a large
green watered Ribband, cro&s;s his Shoul|ders. He was afterwards killed at the
Battle of <HI>Alresford</HI> in <HI>Hamp&s;hire,</HI> in the Year 1644, which
was called <HI>Cheriton</HI> Fight, with the Lord <HI>Bernard Stewart,</HI>
Brother to the Duke of <HI>Rich|mond,</HI> and &s;everal others. Sir <HI>Robert
Wal&s;h,</HI> an <HI>Iri&s;hman,</HI> who al&s;o pretended that he was very
in&s;trumental in regaining the Standard, did al&s;o in the &s;ame Manner wear
a green Rib|band with a Medal; but whether it was given him by Order, or how he
came by it, I do not know, tho' I have often &s;een him wear it. In this Battle
of <HI>Edgehill</HI> (as it was always called) during our Pur&s;uit of the
Enemy, the Earl of <HI>Lind&s;ey</HI> was mortally wounded, and taken
Pri|&s;oner, with his Son the Lord <HI>Willoughby,</HI> who killed the Man that
wounded his Father, who died in the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s Coach, as he
was carrying to <HI>Warwick.</HI> Now, when we returned from following the
Enemy, the Night came &s;oon upon us, whereas, in all Probability, we had
gained the Victory, and made an End of the War, if we had only kept our Ground,
after we had beaten the Enemy, and not left our Foot naked to their Hor&s;e and
Foot: And, <PB N="84" REF="105"> to add to our Misfortune, a carele&s;s
Soldier, in fetching Powder (where a Magazin was) clapt his Hand carele&s;sly
into a Barrel of Powder, with his Match lighted betwixt his Fingers, whereby
much Powder was blown up, and many kill'd. The Night then &s;oon parted both
Armies, and both Sides pretended to the Victory; but &s;ince we retired up the
Hill, from whence we came down, and left the <HI>Champ de Battaile</HI> to the
Enemy, I think we had no great Rea&s;on to brag of a Victory: For, the King,
with a great Part of the Army, marched that Night up to <HI>Wormington</HI>
Hills, it being a hard Fro&s;t, and very cold. But that which made us think we
had the Victory, was, that whereas the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> was commanded
to hinder our getting to <HI>London</HI> before him, by this Battle we were
neare&s;t <HI>London,</HI> and might have been there much before the Earl of
<HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> if we had taken right Mea&s;ures: So that it may be &s;aid
of this Battle, <HI>Victus uterque fuit, Victor uterque fuit.</HI> There is
always great Difference in Relation of Battles, which is u&s;ually according to
the Intere&s;t of the Rela|tors; when it is certain, that, in a Battle, the
next Man can hardly make a true Relation of the Actions of him that is next
him; for, in &s;uch a Hurry and Smoke as in a &s;et Field, a Man takes Notice
of nothing but what relates to his own Safety: So that no Man give a clear
Account of particular Pa&s;&s;ages.</P>
<P>On <HI>Monday</HI> Morning, being next after the Battle, &s;everal
Parties were &s;ent down to view <PB N="85" REF="106"> the Dead, the greate&s;t
Part of the Enemy having retired in the Night to the Town of <HI>Keinton,</HI>
which was near them; and Mr. <HI>Adrian Scroop</HI> having &s;een his Father
fall (being much woun|ded) de&s;ired the Duke of <HI>Lenox</HI> to &s;peak to
the King, that one of his Coaches might go with him, to bring up his Father's
Body; which being granted, he found his Father &s;tript, with &s;everal very
dangerous Wounds, and that he was alive: Whereupon he lapt him up in his Cloak,
and brought him in the Coach, where he was pre&s;ently dre&s;&s;ed by the
King's Chirur|geons, and by their Care and Skill was cured, and lived many
Years after, tho' he had &s;even|teen Wounds, and had died upon the Place, but
that the Coldne&s;s of the Weather &s;topp'd the Bleeding of his Wounds, which
&s;aved al&s;o &s;e|veral other Mens Lives that were wounded. We re&s;ted all
<HI>Monday</HI> upon the Hill, to put our Army in Order; and &s;eeing the Enemy
(as we thought) were preparing to retire, Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> was
re&s;olved, that <HI>Monday</HI> Night, to go down the Hill, at a Place called
<HI>Sun-Ri&s;ing,</HI> a Mile on our left Hand, and to fall upon the Enemy in
their Retreat; and on <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> Morning ve|ry early, the Prince, with
a &s;trong Detatch|ment of Hor&s;e and Dragoons, fell into <HI>Keinton,</HI>
where he found all Hou&s;es full of wounded and &s;ick Men, with divers
Officers, and &s;everal Waggons loaded with Mu&s;kets and Pikes, and all Sorts
of Ammunition, preparing to follow the Army, which was marched towards
<HI>War|wick.</HI> The&s;e Arms were extreamly wanting in <PB N="86" REF="107">
our Army, and were a very good Supply for &s;ome Hundreds of <HI>Welchmen</HI>
were &s;o brave, that they had no Arms but Pitchforks, and &s;uch like Tools,
and many only with good Cudgels; yet they went down the Hill as eagerly to
fight, as the be&s;t armed Men among them. And in|deed mo&s;t of the Gentry in
North <HI>Wales</HI> mo&s;t willingly ingaged for the King, and rai&s;ed what
Men they po&s;&s;ibly could for his Service, while the King &s;tayed in
<HI>Shrop&s;hire</HI>; and the Gentry of that Country did in a mo&s;t
particular Man|ner &s;hew their Zeal for his Maje&s;ty's Service, there being
&s;carce a Family of any Con&s;ideration, in any of tho&s;e Counties, that was
not ingaged for the King; as the <HI>Salisburies,</HI> the <HI>Mo&s;tyns,</HI>
the <HI>Trevors,</HI> the <HI>Thelwells,</HI> and &s;everal others who&s;e
Families I have forgotten: But this I certainly knew, that none &s;erved the
King with greater Loyalty and Affection, than all the Gentry of North
<HI>Wales,</HI> wherein the Family of <HI>Bulkeley</HI> mu&s;t not be
forgotten, who were always very eminent for the King's Service.</P>
<P>After this Battle of <HI>Edgehill,</HI> it was re&s;olved the King
&s;hould ha&s;ten to <HI>London,</HI> and that if he could get thither before
the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> with his Army, the King would be certainly well
received, and, in all Probability, make an End of the War, of which the
Parliament was in &s;uch Fear, that &s;everal Expre&s;&s;es were &s;ent to the
Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> to make all po&s;&s;ible Ha&s;te with his Army to
<HI>London,</HI> and prevent the King's Coming before him: But our King trifled
away his Time in taking <HI>Banbury</HI> and <PB N="87" REF="108">
<HI>Broughton Hou&s;e,</HI> which belonged to the Lord <HI>Say,</HI> Places of
very little Con&s;ideration! and &s;o marched very &s;lowly towards
<HI>London,</HI> where the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> with his Army arrived
before him, tho' the King's Army was much nearer <HI>London,</HI> after the
Battle of <HI>Edgehill,</HI> if right U&s;e had been made of it. By Judgment of
mo&s;t, the Victory in this Battle was the King's, becau&s;e he gain'd his
Point, a clear Pa&s;&s;age for his Way to <HI>London</HI>; of which the
Parliament was &s;o &s;en&s;ible, that not only reiterated Orders were &s;ent
to ha&s;ten the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s March, but all the Shops, both in
<HI>London</HI> and <HI>We&s;tmin|&s;ter,</HI> were &s;hut up the next Day
after the Battle, that the People might be in a better Readine&s;s to defend
them&s;elves and the Parliament.</P>
<P>But alas! the King retarded his March, of which the Earl of
<HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> taking hold, got be|tween the King and <HI>London</HI>; and
in this our March towards <HI>London,</HI> the Parliament &s;ent a Petition to
the King, in a much humbler Strain than their former Me&s;&s;ages to the King
u&s;ed to be; which Petition the King liked well, and re|&s;olved to re&s;ide
at his Ca&s;tle of <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> there to receive the Parliament's
Propo&s;itions: But News being then brought to the King, that
<HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> was advanced towards him, and had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the
Pa&s;&s;es of <HI>Wind&s;or, King&s;ton,</HI> and <HI>Acton,</HI> and that if
<HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> &s;hould al&s;o take <HI>Brentford,</HI> the King would be
wholly &s;urrounded, and depri|ved either of moving or &s;ub&s;i&s;ting:
Whereupon a Council of War was called, and Re&s;olutions taken, that the King's
Army &s;hould advance to <PB N="88" REF="109"> <HI>Brentford,</HI> where, at
the fir&s;t, we found con|&s;iderable Oppo&s;ition. The Prince of
<HI>Wales</HI>'s Regiment of Hor&s;e, where I was, being drawn up behind a
great Hedge, where the Enemy had planted &s;ome Cannon, which we &s;aw not,
till they played &s;o fa&s;t upon us, that we lo&s;t &s;ome Men, and were
obliged to draw off and retire for our better Security; and upon our Foot's
coming up, we beat the Regiments of <HI>Hambden</HI> and <HI>Hollis</HI> out of
the Town, took &s;everal Pri&s;oners and Arms, and &s;unk two great Barks in
the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> with many Sol|diers: And as two other Regiments
came up to their Succour, they were al&s;o beaten, and we took &s;ome Colours
and Cannon, and were in|tire Ma&s;ters of <HI>Brentford,</HI> until the Night;
but then finding the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> with his Army, was drawn out
upon <HI>Turnham Green,</HI> with the Trained Bands of the City, and that the
Ene|my's Army was double to the King's, and that mo&s;t of our Ammunition was
&s;pent; it was therefore thought fit by the Council, that the King &s;hould
retreat. Whereupon the King re|tired that Night to the Lord
<HI>Cottington</HI>'s Hou&s;e, near <HI>Houn&s;low,</HI> and we marched the
next Day by <HI>Colebrook,</HI> towards <HI>Reading</HI> and <HI>Oxford,</HI>
the fir&s;t of which Places was garri&s;oned, and <HI>Oxford</HI> was the
King's Head Quarters, where he made his Re&s;idence. I can give this Relation
with Certainty, being pre&s;ent in all that March, and in the Actions at
<HI>Brentford,</HI> till the King's Return to <HI>Oxford,</HI> and then the
Earl of <HI>Nor|thampton</HI> was commanded to <HI>Banbury,</HI> which 
<PB N="89" REF="110"> was given him for Winter Quarters, with Or|ders to
rai&s;e a Regiment of Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>This Advance of the King's Army towards <HI>London,</HI> when a
Treaty of Peace was propo&s;ed both by the Parliament and the City of
<HI>London,</HI> in a milder Strain than they had ever done be|fore, was by
many thought imprudent to make the Breach wider, and divers Reflections were
made upon it: However, the King &s;ent Word to the Hou&s;es, that he intended
to &s;ettle his Court at &s;uch a Di&s;tance from them, as might take away all
Mi&s;apprehen&s;ions. Hereupon the City petition the King, profe&s;&s;ing their
Grief for his Di&s;tru&s;t of them, and declare their Loy|alty to him. And the
Parliament finding the general Inclinations of the People for Peace, re&s;olved
to &s;end &s;ome Propo&s;itions to the King, which not being accepted, the
Treaty was &s;oon broken off. But then another Treaty was pro|po&s;ed in
<HI>March</HI> following, and new Commi&s;&s;i|oners named, which were only the
Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> with four of the Hou&s;e of Commons, who had
free Acce&s;s to the King, who u&s;ed them with great Civility and Favour, and
treated per&s;onally with them, becau&s;e their In&s;tructions were very
&s;trict, and tied them up to treat with none but the King him&s;elf, where
they often attended, and had Acce&s;s at all Times when they de&s;ired it, and
were allowed a very free Debate with his Maje&s;ty. In this Trea|ty the King
&s;hewed his great Parts and Abilities, Strength of Rea&s;on, and Quickne&s;s
of Appre|hen&s;ion, with much Patience hearing what was <PB N="90" REF="111">
objected again&s;t him, wherein he allowed the Commi&s;&s;ioners all Freedom,
and when he dif|fered from them in Opinion, he would tell them, by your Favour,
my Lord <HI>Northumber|land</HI> (who was the chief of the Commi&s;&s;ioners) I
am not of your Opinion, or, I think other|wi&s;e, and would him&s;elf &s;um up
their Argu|ments, and give a clear Judgment upon them. The King's great
Unhappine&s;s was, that he had a better Opinion of others Judgment, than of his
own (tho' weaker than his own) and of this the&s;e Commi&s;&s;ioners at that
time had a &s;ad Experience, to their great Trouble.</P>
<P>It &s;eems, in this Treaty, they &s;o pre&s;&s;ed his Maje&s;ty
with their be&s;t Rea&s;ons and Arguments, to grant what they de&s;ired, that
the King was &s;o fully &s;atisfied with their Rea&s;ons, that he ab&s;o|lutely
agreed to what they propo&s;ed, and promi|&s;ed to give them their An&s;wer the
next Morning, according to their De&s;ires; but becau&s;e it was then late, and
pa&s;t Midnight, he deferred to give his An&s;wer in Writing till the next
Morning, and commanded them to wait upon him accor|dingly. The
Commi&s;&s;ioners hereupon went to their Lodging full of Joy, in Hopes to
receive the An&s;wer agreed upon; but, in&s;tead of what they expected, and was
promi&s;ed by the King, he gave them a Paper quite contrary to what was
concluded between them the Night before. The Commi&s;&s;ioners did mo&s;t
humbly expo&s;tu|late with his Maje&s;ty, and pre&s;&s;ed him upon his Royal
Word, and the ill Con&s;equences they feared would follow upon this new Paper:
To <PB N="91" REF="112"> which the King told them, he had altered his Mind, and
that the Paper he gave them was his An&s;wer which he was re&s;olved to make
upon their la&s;t Debate, and they could obtain no other An&s;wer from him,
which gave them much Sadne&s;s and Trouble. After this &s;ad Rencoun|ter,
(which the Commi&s;&s;ioners did not expect) they enquired of &s;ome of the
King's particular Coun&s;ellours, how the King came to change his Mind, who
&s;aid, that after the King had left his Council, and was undre&s;&s;ing,
&s;ome of tho&s;e Gentlemen about him, who&s;e Intere&s;t was for Continuance
of the War, and hearing what An&s;wer the King had promi&s;ed, never left
pre&s;&s;ing the King, till they had per&s;waded and prevailed with him, to
change his former Re&s;o|lution, and to order his An&s;wer to be drawn as then
delivered; which being intimated to the Commi&s;&s;ioners, they u&s;ed their
utmo&s;t En|deavours to di&s;&s;wade the King from &s;ending this An&s;wer,
fearing it would break the Treaty; but they could not prevail, the An&s;wer was
&s;ent, and upon the Parliament's receiving it, they fortwith recalled their
Commi&s;&s;ioners, and the Treaty ended un&s;ucce&s;sfully, having la&s;ted
from the Beginning of <HI>March</HI> till the Middle of <HI>April.</HI> This
Relation I had from one of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, my Cou&s;in German, who, I am
&s;ure, wi&s;hed well to the King, and de&s;ired no|thing more than a good
Peace between the King and his People: And this Gentleman was after accu&s;ed
in the Hou&s;e of Commons, by a Lord who was at the Time of the Treaty with the
<PB N="92" REF="113"> King in <HI>Oxford,</HI> but &s;oon after de&s;erted the
King, and went to the Parliament, and accu&s;ed that Commi&s;&s;ioner to have
had &s;everal private Conferences with the King, unknown to the re&s;t of the
Commi&s;&s;ioners; and if that Per&s;on had not been powerfully &s;upported,
and high|ly defended by Mr. <HI>Denzell Hollis,</HI> who was al&s;o a
Commi&s;&s;ioner, that other Per&s;on had been ruined by that Lord's fal&s;e
Accu&s;ation, who quite lo&s;t his Reputation by it. Thus we &s;ee a good King
was unhappily mi&s;led by tho&s;e about him, which cau&s;ed him often to
refu&s;e tho&s;e things to which he &s;hould chearfully have con&s;ented, and
freely have conde&s;cended to many things which he &s;hould have denied to the
la&s;t. It is certain, a Prince &s;hould e&s;teem nothing more precious than
his Word, nothing more &s;acred than his Promi&s;e; which made <HI>Francis</HI>
I. of <HI>France</HI> &s;ay, That if Faith was to|tally bani&s;hed out of the
World, it &s;hould be found in his Word. Indeed a Prince &s;hould be careful of
promi&s;ing any thing that may be of Damage to him, and where the Thing
pro|mi&s;ed cannot without good Rea&s;on bind to the Performance; and whether
what the King pro|mi&s;ed to tho&s;e Commi&s;&s;ioners were of that &s;ort, I
will not undertake to determine.</P>
<P>When the King had &s;ettled his Court at <HI>Oxford,</HI>
recruited his Army, and fortified his Garri&s;ons in all Parts, he gave
<HI>Banbury,</HI> and that Part of the Country, to the Earl of
<HI>Nor|thampton,</HI> who was commanded to rai&s;e a Re|giment of Hor&s;e,
which was given to the Lord <PB N="93" REF="114"> <HI>Compton,</HI> his
elde&s;t Son, and Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> his &s;econd Son, was made Lieutenant
Collonel of it: To Sir <HI>William Compton,</HI> his third Son, was given the
Ca&s;tle of <HI>Banbury:</HI> One Troop in his Regiment of Hor&s;e was given to
Captain <HI>James Chamberlain,</HI> Brother to Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> who was
then High Sheriff of <HI>Oxford&s;hire:</HI> To Captain <HI>James
Chamberlain</HI> were given the two Villages of Upper and Lower
<HI>Heigford,</HI> oppo&s;ite to <HI>North</HI> and <HI>Steeple A&s;ton,</HI>
in <HI>Oxford&s;hire,</HI> for his Quarters, while he rai&s;ed the &s;aid
Company. Mr. <HI>Herbert Jeffries,</HI> of <HI>Hereford&s;hire,</HI> was his
Lieutenant, and I was his Cornet. This Com|pany was &s;oon rai&s;ed, and the
fir&s;t Time the Captain went out with it, he was killed near
<HI>Northampton,</HI> by one Captain <HI>Law&s;on.</HI> About the &s;ame time
Mr. <HI>Herbert Jeffries</HI> was &s;ent for by his Uncle Sir <HI>Herbert
Price,</HI> upon Mr. <HI>Jef|fries</HI>'s Father being drowned in pa&s;&s;ing
the Ri|ver <HI>Wye:</HI> Whereupon Mr. <HI>Jeffries</HI> came no more back, and
the Troop of Hor&s;e fell to my Lot, where I continued not long; for the Lord
<HI>Wentworth,</HI> who was Major-General of the Hor&s;e by the Death of Sir
<HI>Thomas Byron,</HI> was al&s;o made Collonel of the Prince of
<HI>Wales</HI>'s Regiment; and being very inqui&s;itive to find out a young
active Man to be his Adjutant, I was recommended to his Lord&s;hip, by Mr.
<HI>Hat|ton Farmer</HI> (Son to Sir <HI>William Farmer</HI> of
<HI>Eu|&s;ton</HI> in <HI>Northampton&s;hire</HI>) who was at that time Cornet
to the Prince of <HI>Wales.</HI> The great Dif|ficulty was, whether I &s;hould
quit my Troop, to be his Lord&s;hip's Adjutant? To which I was 
<PB N="94" REF="115"> advi&s;ed by many, a&s;&s;uring me by that Employ|ment I
&s;hould know more of the War in one Year, than being a Captain all my
Lifetime; and &s;o I quitted my Company, with the good Will of the Earl of
<HI>Northampton,</HI> after I had been at the Battle of <HI>Middleton
Cheney,</HI> near <HI>Banbury,</HI> where we beat the Parliament Troops. Upon
the quitting my Troop, Mr. <HI>George Chamberlain,</HI> another Brother of Sir
<HI>Thomas,</HI> was made Captain of it; and I had not been long with my Lord
<HI>Wentworth,</HI> before my Lord <HI>Wilmot,</HI> being Lieutenant General of
the Hor&s;e, de&s;ired me to be his Adjutant, which his Lord|&s;hip could not
refu&s;e, the Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI> being his &s;uperior General Officer; and in
that Sta|tion I remained with my Lord <HI>Wilmot,</HI> to his great
Satisfaction, till his Di&s;grace in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> as &s;hall be &s;aid
hereafter.</P>
<P>During this Year 1643, I was Adjutant to my Lord <HI>Wilmot,</HI>
when he defeated <HI>Waller</HI> at <HI>Roundway-Down,</HI> near the
<HI>Devizes,</HI> took his Cannon, Ammunition, and Baggage, with &s;ome Foot
Colours and Standards, and <HI>Wallet</HI> him&s;elf e&s;caped to
<HI>Bri&s;tol.</HI> By this Lo&s;s of <HI>Waller</HI>'s, the King was Ma&s;ter
of all the We&s;t, <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> and <HI>Exeter</HI> being &s;oon after
delivered; and if the King had then marched to <HI>London,</HI> he had, in all
Probability, made an End of the War. But he was ill (if not maliciou&s;ly)
per&s;waded, to be&s;iege <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> which was the only Place left
to the Parliament in the&s;e Parts. The King had Intentions of Storming it, but
fear|ing to lo&s;e the be&s;t Part of his Infantry in that <PB N="95" REF="116"> Action, and being a&s;&s;ured it could not be re|lieved, made the
King lo&s;e much Time, and the Opportunity of taking it: For the Earl of
<HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> &s;oon rai&s;ed an Army in <HI>London,</HI> for its Relief;
to prevent which, Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> and the Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI> were
&s;ent with all the Hor&s;e, to &s;top his Pa&s;&s;age, or at lea&s;t to retard
his March through <HI>Oxford&s;hire:</HI> And tho' the Prince had then a brave
Army, and was mo&s;t commonly in a Race Campagne, and that we &s;till marched
before <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> to eat up the Provi&s;ions, and to attend his
Motions, yet we took no Advantage of him, nor was his De&s;ign of rai&s;ing the
Siege of <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI> prevented, tho' it was then in the la&s;t
Extremity. When <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> came upon the Brow of the Hills, not far
di&s;tant from <HI>Glou|ce&s;ter,</HI> he di&s;charged &s;ome Cannon, to give
them Notice of his Coming, and the King hereupon rai&s;ed the Siege, without
any Lo&s;s or Impeach|ment from the Town. Thus, when the King's Affairs were in
a pro&s;perous Condition, he trifled away Time to no Purpo&s;e in that
unfor|tunate Siege. When <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> had put the City of
<HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI> in Order, and left them Cannon and Ammunition, he marched
unexpectedly to <HI>Tewksbury,</HI> which he &s;urprized, and &s;ent from
thence great Stores of all Sorts of Provi&s;ion, which the King &s;ent thither
from his Camp; and <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> likewi&s;e took in <HI>Tewksbury</HI> two
Re|giments of Hor&s;e, with divers Officers, com|manded by Sir <HI>Nicholas
Cri&s;p;</HI> from whence he marched towards <HI>London,</HI> by the way of
<HI>Hun|gerford</HI> and <HI>Newbury,</HI> where was the fir&s;t
<HI>New|bury</HI> <PB N="96" REF="117"> Fight; but &s;ince I was not pre&s;ent
in that Battle, I will not pretend to give a Relation of it: Only this I may
&s;ay truly, that we &s;taked there Pearls again&s;t Pebbles, and lo&s;t &s;ome
Men there of great Con&s;ideration, tho' the Enemy lo&s;t more Soldiers, and
were obliged to quit their Station; and in this Year 43, the King was &s;o
&s;ucce&s;sful, that the Parliament began to de&s;pair, and the prevailing
Party in the Hou&s;e of Commons were ready to tru&s;s up Bag and Baggage: But
<HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s Succe&s;s at <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI> chan|ged the Scene of
publick Affairs, and the King returned to <HI>Oxford.</HI> It was about this
time that the Earls of <HI>Bedford</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> de&s;erted the
Parliament, and came to <HI>Oxford,</HI> to &s;ubmit them&s;elves to the King:
But they not being received nor countenanced as they expected, they both
returned again to the Parliament: When the King ought mo&s;t certainly to have
received them well, and to have u&s;ed them kindly, for Encouragement to
others. But our unfortunate Prince was &s;till advi&s;ed to take fal&s;e
Mea&s;ures, in Affairs that mo&s;t nearly concer|ned him. Upon their fir&s;t
Coming, there was a Debate in Council, by the King's Order, how they &s;hould
be received? Some thought his Ma|je&s;ty &s;hould receive them very
graciou&s;ly, and with kind Expre&s;&s;ions of his Acceptance of their Return
to his Service, and that the Behaviour of all others towards them, &s;hould be
&s;uch as might make them think them&s;elves very wel|come, without taking
Notice of any thing for|merly done ami&s;s by them: But others, of a 
<PB N="97" REF="118"> contrary Judgment, would not have them ad|mitted into the
King's Pre&s;ence. Betwixt the&s;e Extremes, others were of Opinion, they
&s;hould neither be neglected nor courted, but admitted to ki&s;s the King and
Queen's Hands. But the Rea&s;on of old <HI>Fabius</HI> ought to have been
con&s;i|dered, which he gave in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Co&s;&s;ius Altinius,</HI>
who, after the Battle of <HI>Cannae,</HI> de|&s;erted the <HI>Romans,</HI> and
fled to <HI>Hannibal</HI>; and when the Condition of the <HI>Romans</HI>
mended, he came again to them. Hereupon many thought he &s;hould be e&s;teemed
as a common Enemy, and &s;ent back to <HI>Hannibal,</HI> as a perfidious
Per&s;on; but <HI>Fabius</HI> reprehended their Severity as unrea|&s;onable,
who judged in the Heat of War, as in the Time of Peace, and told them, their
chief Care ought to be, that none of their Friends &s;hould for&s;ake them, and
next, that they who had for&s;aken them, might return to their Obedience and
Protection, and be well u&s;ed: Which Method &s;hould have been taken with
the&s;e two Earls, which had prevented their Return, and encouraged others to
follow them.</P>
<P>But it was the unhappy Temper of tho&s;e who were often called to
Council in this King's Time, that Re&s;olutions taken upon full Debate, were
&s;eldom pro&s;ecuted with equal Re&s;olution, but often changed upon new and
&s;hort Debates; and many Coun&s;ellours were irre&s;olute and un|con&s;tant,
and full of Objections, which much hindred good Re&s;olutions. And the great
Mi&s;|fortune was, that the King mo&s;t commonly <PB N="98" REF="119">
con&s;idered more the Per&s;on that &s;poke, as he was in his Grace or
Prejudice, than the Coun|&s;el it &s;elf; and always &s;u&s;pected, or at
lea&s;t tru&s;ted le&s;s to his own Judgment than he ought to have done, which
rarely deceived him &s;o much as that of other Men: And if in the Ca&s;e
aforementioned, he had followed his own Judgment, he had received and u&s;ed
tho&s;e Lords very kindly. But at this time the King's Affairs were in a
flouri&s;hing Condition, and it was the unlucky Temper of the King's Party, to
be the mo&s;t de&s;perately ca&s;t down upon the lea&s;t ill Succe&s;s, and,
upon any good, to be the mo&s;t elated; and therefore were of Opinion again&s;t
receiving tho&s;e Lords with any Civility, believing they returned to the King,
becau&s;e the Parliament's Affairs were at that time but in a tottering
Condition.</P>
<P>The King having &s;ucce&s;sfully &s;ettled military Affairs the
la&s;t Year, and the Parliament fear|ing a farther Encrea&s;e of them, called
to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance their Brethren the <HI>Scots,</HI> in Pur&s;u|ance of
their wicked League and Covenant; which &s;econd Voyage of theirs into
<HI>England,</HI> brought that Deluge of Mi&s;chiefs which after|wards
followed; for, in the Beginning of the Year 44, the King's Affairs begun to
change Face, for <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> and <HI>Waller</HI> were &s;oon recruited
at <HI>London,</HI> and by the Help of other a&s;&s;ocia|ted Counties, they
rai&s;ed two powerful Armies, marched into <HI>Oxford&s;hire,</HI> hovering
about the King's Head Quarters, who not liking &s;uch Neighbours, had a Mind to
draw them from <PB N="99" REF="120"> thence, and therefore left
<HI>Oxford.</HI> Upon this the Enemy was ordered to follow the King, leaving
his evil Coun&s;ellours unmole&s;ted in <HI>Oxford,</HI> contrary to what they
had always till then pretended, that their De&s;ign was only to remove the evil
Coun&s;ellours; but now it plainly appeared, that their De&s;ign was again&s;t
the King's &s;acred Per&s;on, &s;ince both Armies followed him, which being too
great to conti|nue long together, they &s;eparated, and <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> was
per&s;waded by the Lord <HI>Roberts,</HI> and others, to reduce the We&s;tern
Counties to the Obedi|ence of the Parliament, and that <HI>Waller,</HI> with
his Army, &s;hould attend the King's Motions, who was marching, as the Enemy
thought, to|wards <HI>Wales:</HI> But the King gave <HI>Waller</HI> the Go-by,
and having gotten before him, was marching to <HI>Daventry</HI> in great
Diligence, ha|ving left a &s;trong Guard of Dragoons at <HI>Cro|predy</HI>
Bridge (a Pa&s;s over the <HI>Charwell</HI> between both Armies)
<HI>Waller</HI> being on the other Side the River, waiting the King; and
perceiving the Guard was drawn off from <HI>Cropredy</HI> Bridge, and that the
Van of the King's Army was much before their Rear, the Van having marched
fa&s;ter than was nece&s;&s;ary; &s;o that the Rear of the King's were but then
come to their Ren|dezvous, and were not advanced &s;o far as the Bridge, which
the King's Guard had quitted. <HI>Waller</HI> taking this Advantage, pa&s;&s;ed
over a great Part of his Army at this Bridge, under the Command of Collonel
<HI>Weems,</HI> who was General of the Artillery, with &s;everal Cannon 
<PB N="100" REF="121"> of <HI>Weems</HI>'s Invention, being more ea&s;y of
Car|riage; and this great Detachment of <HI>Waller</HI>'s Army was drawn up
ju&s;t in the Way where the Rear of the King's Army was to pa&s;s, which was
commanded by the old Earl of <HI>Cleveland,</HI> who was of Nece&s;&s;ity
obliged to fight the Ene|my,. before he could get to the Van of the King's
Army; the whole Army of <HI>Waller</HI> being drawn up on the other Side the
River, to pa&s;s the Bridge, in Ca&s;e <HI>Weems</HI> &s;ucceeded, of which
<HI>Waller</HI> doubted not, having pa&s;&s;ed over many more Troops than the
Earl of <HI>Cleveland</HI> had in the Rear. However, the Earl behaved
him|&s;elf &s;o well in that Engagement, that, after a very &s;harp Di&s;pute,
the Enemy was beaten, and forced over <HI>Cropredy</HI> Bridge, to join their
Army. Many were killed upon the Place, and many Pri&s;oners taken, with all
their Cannon and Ammunition, and, among&s;t the Pri&s;oners, <HI>Weems,</HI> a
<HI>Scot,</HI> and the King's &s;worn Servant, being made Ma&s;ter-Gunner of
<HI>England,</HI> a con|&s;iderable Employment; and be&s;ides, he had a good
Sum of Money given him, for the Inven|tion of making tho&s;e Leather Cannon.
After the Battle, he was was brought before the King, and had the Impudence to
tell his Maje&s;ty, in his <HI>Scotch</HI> Tone, That, in good Faith, his Heart
was always towards his Maje&s;ty. This Victory was not obtained without &s;ome
Lo&s;s on our Side, for Sir <HI>William Boteler,</HI> and Sir <HI>Wil-William
Clark,</HI> both Collonels of Hor&s;e, were killed, and much regretted, being
brave Men. We had there a Regiment of Dragoons com|manded <PB N="101" REF="122"> by Collonel <HI>Hooper,</HI> who &s;ignalized him&s;elf upon this
Occa&s;ion &s;o well, that tho' he was of a mean Education, and &s;mall
Extra|ction, yet &s;uch particular Notice was taken of him by the Earl of
<HI>Cleveland,</HI> who gave &s;o good an Account of his Service that Day, that
the King gave him the Honour of Knighthood, by the Name of Sir <HI>Thomas
Hooper,</HI> to encou|rage others to follow his Example. This De|feat made
<HI>Waller</HI> ha&s;ten to <HI>London</HI> for Recruits, and the King taking
Advantage of his Retreat, turned again with his Army, and marched with great
Diligence after the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> who was gone into the
We&s;t.</P>
<P>While the King was upon his March, he had an Account, that
<HI>York</HI> was be&s;ieged by the <HI>Scots,</HI> who were joined with
<HI>Fairfax</HI> and <HI>Man|che&s;ter</HI>; upon which Information, the King
&s;ent Orders to Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> to join with the Mar|que&s;s of
<HI>Newca&s;tle</HI>'s Army, to rai&s;e that Siege, which the Prince did; but
not content with that, he would needs follow the Enemy, with whom he fought
upon <HI>Mar&s;ton-Moor,</HI> four Miles from <HI>York,</HI> and had defeated
the Enemy, di&s;ordered their main Battle, po&s;&s;e&s;s'd their Cannon, and
forced their three Generals out of the Field; but being too furious in
pur&s;uing his Advantage, and his Soldiers too bu&s;y in Pillaging,
<HI>Cromwell,</HI> who then commanded the Hor&s;e under <HI>Manche&s;ter,</HI>
having rallied toge|ther &s;ome Troops, charged the Prince, and pre&s;&s;ed him
&s;o hard, that he changed the whole Fortune of the Day, and forced the Prince
to a <PB N="102" REF="123"> di&s;orderly Flight, and gained an entire Victory,
and took Pri&s;oners Major General <HI>George Porter,</HI> Sir <HI>Charles
Lucas,</HI> Collonel <HI>Tybiard,</HI> and &s;eve|ral others. This Defeat was
infinitely preju|dicial to the King's Affairs in the North, the Lo&s;s of
<HI>York</HI> &s;oon following it, and many Re|flections were made upon the
Prince's Fighting, which he &s;hould not have done, his Bu&s;ine&s;s only
having been to rai&s;e the Siege of <HI>York.</HI> Hereupon the Marque&s;s of
<HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> with &s;everal other eminent Officers in the North, being
highly di&s;&s;atisfied with the Prince, quit|ted <HI>England,</HI> and went to
<HI>Hamburgh,</HI> whereby the whole North was &s;oon after lo&s;t. The King
having received an Account of this De|feat in his March, ha&s;tened the more
after <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and being come into a Race Campagne in
<HI>Cornwal,</HI> three or four Miles only from the Ene|my, and General
<HI>Goring</HI> being newly come from the North, after the Defeat of
<HI>Mar&s;ton-Moor,</HI> and was then with the King in the Head of his Army,
the Van of which was that Day commanded by the Lord <HI>Wentworth,</HI> Major
General, and the Lord <HI>Wilmot,</HI> Lieutenant General, brought up the Rear
of the Army with his own Brigade; and being ready to go to Prayers, Mr.
<HI>Elliot,</HI> of the King's Bed-cham|ber, came to his Lord&s;hip, and told
him, the King would &s;peak with him: To which the Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI>
replied, <HI>You &s;ee I am ju&s;t going to Prayers, I will &s;erve God
fir&s;t, and then I &s;hall &s;erve the King the better after, and will
pre&s;ently wait upon the King after Prayers:</HI> <PB N="103" REF="124"> Which
being ended, as his Lord&s;hip was mar|ching up to the King, Sir <HI>Edward
Sydenham,</HI> Knight-Mar&s;hal, came riding down the Hill, with &s;everal
Gentlemen, and told the Lord <HI>Wilmot,</HI> that the King commanded him to be
his Pri&s;oner. His Lord&s;hip being &s;omewhat &s;urprized with this
Me&s;&s;age, turned his Hor&s;e, and I a&s;ked him, what Service he would
com|mand me? To which his Lord&s;hip pre&s;ently replied, <HI>I can command you
nothing, being a Pri&s;oner; but I pray you acquaint the Lord</HI> Wentworth
<HI>with my pre&s;ent Condition</HI>; which I did, who was much &s;urprized
with it, and &s;o were all the other General Officers to whom I told it; and
they all concluded it was the Ef|fect of General <HI>Goring</HI>'s coming to
the King. The Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI> forthwith alighted, with &s;everal other
principal Officers, to con&s;ider what Mea&s;ures to take, in &s;o &s;udden and
unex|pected a Change, and were all much un&s;atisfied, believing General
<HI>Goring</HI> to be the Cau&s;e, of whom they had no good Opinion, &s;ince
his Examination in Parliament, at the Beginning of the War, when he was
Governour of <HI>Port&s;|mouth,</HI> which he &s;oon delivered, and made good
Conditions for his going into <HI>France,</HI> after he had received Money on
both Sides, and re&s;to|red to neither. Upon this Con&s;ideration, the General
Officers of Hor&s;e were &s;o far from be|ing &s;atisfied with the Change, that
they pre|&s;ently drew up an Addre&s;s to the King, which was penned by Mr.
<HI>Adrian Scroop,</HI> the Sub&s;tance of which was, as I well remember, as
followeth. <PB N="104" REF="125"> <HI>That they, the Lord</HI> Wentworth,
<HI>and other Ge|neral Officers of the Army, having had the Honourlong to
&s;erve his Maje&s;ty under the Command of the Lord</HI> Wilmot, <HI>were &s;o
well and intimately acquainted with all his Concerns relating to the Army, that
they were confident he could be guilty of no Crime but what they mu&s;t know;
and that finding his Lord&s;hip &s;uddenly di&s;graced, and fallen into his
Maje&s;ty's Di&s;plea&s;ure, they there|fore mo&s;t humbly begged his Maje&s;ty
would gra|ciou&s;ly plea&s;e to let them know what Fault the Lord</HI> Wilmot
<HI>had committed, that they might free them&s;elves from it, or mo&s;t humbly
implore the King's Pardon for it.</HI> This Addre&s;s was pre&s;ented to the
King by the Lord <HI>Wentworth,</HI> accompanied with &s;everal General
Officers, and others of the Army. I was then pre&s;ent, when the King, having
fir&s;t read the Addre&s;s to him|&s;elf, gave this verbal An&s;wer, which I
heard the King &s;ay. <HI>That if the Lord</HI> Wilmot <HI>had continued to
command his Army of Hor&s;e, his Crown could not have long &s;tood upon his
Head;</HI> and he a&s;&s;ured the Lord <HI>Wentworth,</HI> and tho&s;e Officers
with him, that when the Bu&s;ine&s;s was over with the Earl of
<HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> (with whom he was now engaged) we &s;hould all know what
Fault the Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI> had committed: That, in the <HI>Interim</HI> his
Maje&s;ty was well &s;atisfied of their Loyalty, who had pre&s;ented that
Addre&s;s, and commanded them to go to their &s;everal Brigades and Regiments,
and to obey General <HI>Goring,</HI> whom he had made General of all his
Cavalry.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="126">Hereupon General <HI>Goring</HI> went to the
Head of the Hor&s;e, to command a Thou&s;and to be drawn out; but not finding
the Lord <HI>Went|worth,</HI> nor the Adjutant General, he returned to the
King, and complained, he could find no General Officer, or Adjutant, to draw
out a Party: Whereupon the King a&s;ked for me (who every Night brought his
Maje&s;ty the Li&s;t of the Quarters) and &s;ent <HI>Tomkins,</HI> an Equerry,
to find me, and bring me to his Maje&s;ty, which he &s;oon did; and the King
commanded me to go with General <HI>Goring,</HI> and obey his Orders: And
accordingly I forthwith drew out a De|tachment of One Thou&s;and Hor&s;e, under
the Conduct of Collonel <HI>Richard Nevil,</HI> of <HI>Billing|beer</HI> in
<HI>Berk&s;hire.</HI> The General was plea&s;ed with my Diligence, in &s;o
&s;oon drawing out the Detachment, and commanded me to come with him, and told
me, he made me that Day his Adjutant; and that I being the fir&s;t Man that the
King had recommended to him, he would take particular Care of me, and
a&s;&s;ured me, that whenever Collonel <HI>Scrim&s;our,</HI> an old
<HI>Scotch|man,</HI> that was Adjutant-General, died, he would make me
Adjutant-General; which hap|pened &s;oon after, and then I was made
Adju|tant-General of all the Hor&s;e that were, or &s;hould be rai&s;ed in the
Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> Dominion of <HI>Wales,</HI> and the Town of
<HI>Berwick</HI> upon <HI>Tweed,</HI> for &s;o my Commi&s;&s;ion ran. But,
leaving this Digre&s;&s;ion, I mu&s;t not omit to tell, that General
<HI>Goring</HI> being advanced to the Top of the Hill, about two Miles before
our Army, <PB N="106" REF="127"> had there a perfect View of the Enemy, who
were then about <HI>Le&s;twythiel.</HI> He &s;topp'd then, and &s;ent me back
in great Ha&s;te to the King, to tell him in what Po&s;ture the Enemy was,
de&s;iring the King to advance with his Army without Delay, and that he would
make good the Po&s;t where he was, which would be very advantageous for his
Maje&s;ty's Army. In the mean time that I went from General <HI>Goring</HI> to
the King, he commanded Collonel <HI>Nevil</HI> to &s;end a Party towards
<HI>Buconnock,</HI> the Lord <HI>Mohun</HI>'s Hou&s;e, where perhaps a further
Di&s;|covery might be made of the Enemy. Where|upon Collonel <HI>Nevil</HI>
&s;ent out a Party under the Command of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Ga&s;coigne,</HI> a
<HI>Florentine,</HI> who meeting &s;ome Country-Men, he a&s;ked them, if they
knew any thing of the Enemy? Who told him, if he made Ha&s;te to the Lord
<HI>Mohun</HI>'s Hou&s;e, he would find there &s;ome of the Parlia|ment
Officers at Dinner, not believing the King's Army was &s;o near them. Whereupon
the Party ha&s;tened thither, and &s;urprized &s;e|veral Officers, whom they
brought Pri&s;oners; for which Service, and &s;ome others after, he was
Knighted, and known by the Name of Sir <HI>Bernard Ga&s;coigne,</HI> and was
made Major to General <HI>Goring</HI>'s Regiment of Hor&s;e, and &s;erved not
only to the End of the War in very good E&s;teem, but was al&s;o at the
Ri&s;ing in <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and condemned to be &s;hot to Death at
<HI>Colche|&s;ter,</HI> with Sir <HI>Charles Lucas,</HI> and Sir <HI>George
Li&s;le;</HI> but being a Foreigner, he was reprieved, and &s;aved. And now I
will tell the Rea&s;ons <PB N="107" REF="128"> why I appointed Collonel
<HI>Nevil</HI> to command this Detachment of a Thou&s;and Hor&s;e, tho' it was
not his Turn to go. Whil&s;t the Addre&s;s from the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI> and
the General Officers was making to the King, his Lord&s;hip commanded me to go
to &s;uch Collonels of Hor&s;e in the Army, to de&s;ire their Agreeing and
Sign|ing to the Addre&s;s: And when I told Collonel <HI>Nevil</HI> of it, he
&s;aid, he was as great a Servant to the Lord <HI>Wilmot,</HI> and had as good
an Opi|nion of him as any Per&s;on in the Army, well knowing that his
Lord&s;hip had long and faith|fully &s;erved the King; but yet, whoever the
King &s;hould &s;et over him, he would obey: And added, that he thought not
fit, at that Time e&s;pecially, to di&s;pute the King's Commands, when they
were going to attack the Enemy; and that therefore he would have no Hand in the
Addre&s;s, and de&s;ired the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI> to excu&s;e him: And it
was upon this Con&s;idera|tion that I cho&s;e Collonel <HI>Nevil</HI> to
command that Detachment, tho' I knew it was not his Turn to go; in which he
acted to the Gene|ral's great Satisfaction, who had ever after a great E&s;teem
and Value for him.</P>
<P>At my Return to the King with the Me&s;&s;age of General
<HI>Goring,</HI> the King forthwith marched with his Army towards him, who not
only made good the Po&s;t where he was, but, upon the Earl of
<HI>Brentford</HI>'s drawing and advancing farther, (who then commanded the
Army in chief under the King) and reviewing the Sci|tuation of
<HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s Army, which then began to <PB N="108" REF="129"> retire
towards <HI>Foy,</HI> the King's Army did there|upon advance nearer the Enemy,
and the King's General Head Quarters were &s;ettled at <HI>Bucon|nock,</HI> the
Lord <HI>Mohun</HI>'s Hou&s;e, and Sir <HI>Richard Greenvil</HI> was ordered,
with &s;ome Regiments of Foot, to fix them at the Lord <HI>Roberts</HI>'s
Hou&s;e, a &s;trong Quarters oppo&s;ite to the King's, on the other Side the
Valley; at the Head of which Valley a &s;trong Guard of Hor&s;e was ordered to
be con&s;tantly kept, to keep in the Enemy; our whole Army being encamped on
both Sides the Valley, which prevented the Enemy from making any Excur&s;ion
that Way. But, becau&s;e the re&s;t of <HI>Cornwal</HI> behind the Enemy was
open, it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end a &s;trong Detachment thither, to
&s;top their Pa&s;&s;age on that Side. Whereupon General <HI>Goring</HI> was
&s;ent with the greate&s;t Part of the Hor&s;e to St. <HI>Bla&s;e</HI> Bridge,
which was the only Pa&s;&s;age by which the Ene|my could enlarge their Quarters
on that Side. Sir <HI>Thomas Ba&s;&s;et,</HI> a <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> Man, was
likewi&s;e &s;ent thither with his Tertia of Foot, and I was with his
Excellency. The Enemy, by this Di&s;po&s;ition of our Army, finding they were
encompa&s;&s;ed on all Sides, and that it was im|po&s;&s;ible to break through
with their whole Ar|my, without apparent Ruine, re&s;olved to chu&s;e the
lea&s;t Evil, and that their Hor&s;e, being about Two Thou&s;and, &s;hould
attempt in the Night to break thro' the Valley between both Armies, which
&s;ucceeding, they might march with great Diligence, and pa&s;s the River at
<HI>Salta&s;h,</HI> before our Army could overtake them, <PB N="109" REF="130">
and &s;o get to <HI>Plymouth,</HI> and that <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> &s;hould take
Shipping at <HI>Foy,</HI> and meet his Hor&s;e at <HI>Plymouth</HI>; and that
Major General <HI>Skippon,</HI> who commanded the Infantry, &s;hould &s;tay
with them, to defend them as long as he could, and at la&s;t make Articles for
them, being caught in a Net. This Re&s;olution being taken, it was put in
Execution the next Night; and Gene|ral <HI>Goring</HI> being at St.
<HI>Bla&s;e,</HI> a Soldier from the King's Quarters, for Orders brought a
Letter without any Seal, written in great Ha&s;te by the King him&s;elf, in
the&s;e Words: <HI>Goring, the Enemy have, this Night pa&s;t, broke thro' our
Quarters with their Hor&s;e, after &s;ome Re&s;i&s;tance made by our Hor&s;e
Guard commanded by</HI> Cleve|land, <HI>who was not able to hinder their
Pa&s;&s;age, being near five times his Number. They were like to have
&s;urprized Sir</HI> Edward Waldgrave<HI>'s Brigade in their Pa&s;&s;age; but
he having &s;ome Notice of their March, prevented them. They are gone in great.
Ha&s;te, without Bag or Bag|gage, towards</HI> Salta&s;h, <HI>commanded by
Sir</HI> Wil|liam Balfour. <HI>Some of our Hor&s;e are gone to &s;top their
Pa&s;&s;age at</HI> Salta&s;h, <HI>if it be po&s;&s;ible: You mu&s;t therefore
immediately march after them with all your Hor&s;e, and leave</HI> Butler
<HI>with the Foot to keep St.</HI> Bla&s;e <HI>Bridge.</HI> The General got his
Army together forthwith, and marched after the Enemy with great Diligence, but
was told by &s;ome Troops that followed them from the King's Quarters, that it
was impo&s;&s;ible to overtake them, they being returned upon that Account.
Upon this Information, which the <PB N="110" REF="131"> General had from &s;ome
con&s;iderable Officers, who had followed the Enemy to no Purpo&s;e, his
Excellency thought fit to return, and &s;ent the Hor&s;e to their Quarters, and
went to tell the King, he had been able to do nothing of what he had commanded.
The General then &s;tayed with the King, where Orders were forth|with given
concerning the Enemy's Infantry; and upon A&s;&s;urance that the Earl of
<HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> with the Lord <HI>Roberts,</HI> and &s;everal others, were
gone by Sea to <HI>Plymouth,</HI> and that their Foot Army began early in the
Morning to retire towards <HI>Foy,</HI> in Hopes to find Ships there to
tran&s;port them to their General <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> at <HI>Ply|mouth:</HI> The
King's Army hereupon, being in their Rear, pre&s;&s;ed them &s;o clo&s;e, that
they were forced to fight from Hedge to Hedge, be|ing in an inclo&s;ed Country;
and tho' they were many times put to a di&s;orderly Retreat, how|ever they
fought till the Night parted us. The next Morning early Major General
<HI>Skippon</HI> &s;ent Collonel <HI>Butler</HI> to de&s;ire a Parly, which
being accepted, and Ho&s;tages delivered, the Treaty began that Morning in the
King's Quar|ters, and Articles were &s;oon agreed upon, all Arms, Cannon and
Ammunition, to be delive|red with their Carriages. We took Fifty Pieces of
Bra&s;s Cannon, Three Hundred Barrels of Powder, with Match and Ball
proportionable, Seven Hundred Carriages, between Nine and Ten Thou&s;and Arms,
and many common Sol|diers de&s;erted, and tho&s;e who &s;tayed, marched off
only with Sticks in their Hands; but all <PB N="111" REF="132"> Collonels and
Field Officers were on Hor&s;eback, with their Swords only, with Major General
<HI>Skippon</HI> in the Head of the Army, who carried his Lo&s;s with a very
good Grace, and they were to be conducted to <HI>Winche&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>Collonel <HI>Thomas Bul&s;trode,</HI> my Cou&s;in Ger|man, had
there a Foot Regiment, and I pre|vailed with General <HI>Goring,</HI> that, if
I could di&s;engage him from that Service, he &s;hould be well received, and
have the &s;ame Command in our Army: And, in order to this, I accompa|nied him
two Days, and &s;hewed him all the Kindne&s;s I could, and u&s;ed my be&s;t
Endeavours to take him off from that Party; but he was &s;o bigotted, and
&s;educed by the Zealots of that Army, that I could prevail nothing with him,
who told me plainly, he was re&s;olved to &s;uffer with his Brethren (as he
called them) rather than to quit them, or accept of any Employ|ment I could
offer him: And added, that his Father was Governour of <HI>Aylesbury,</HI> and
had rai&s;ed at his own Expences two Regiments for the Parliament, and that he
was re&s;olved to run the &s;ame Fortune with the re&s;t of his Com|rades, and
therefore de&s;ired I would not pre&s;s him farther in that again&s;t which he
had taken a final Re&s;olution; and &s;o I left him as I found him, wilful,
&s;tubborn, and full of rebellious Principles.</P>
<P>This Defeat of their Army in <HI>Cornwal</HI> was certainly of
very great Con&s;equence; for, tho' their Hor&s;e e&s;caped, yet mo&s;t of
their Foot were de&s;troyed by their long and tedious March 
<PB N="112" REF="133"> thro' an Enemy's Country, wanting Provi&s;ions and
Nece&s;&s;aries, e&s;pecially thro' <HI>Cornwal</HI> and <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI>
which were great Enemies to them, and all our Army of Hor&s;e marching at the
&s;ame time near them, towards <HI>Oxford,</HI> and our Infantry followed; &s;o
that the Country People would &s;carce give them Provi&s;ions for Money. They
found the &s;ame al&s;o in <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire,</HI> the Country People being
u&s;ually for the &s;tronge&s;t Party, and the King's Affairs at that time run
very &s;moothly: And tho' the Parliament Offi|cers did always le&s;&s;en their
Defeats, and enlarge their Victories, yet this Lo&s;s of theirs was &s;o
vi&s;ible, that it gave great Reputation to the King's Affairs, and many
&s;curvy Reflections were made upon <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s leaving the Army,
which did proceed (as was publickly &s;aid) ei|ther out of Fear or Cowardice,
neither of which was believed by thinking Men, knowing that the Earl of
<HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> dur&s;t fight, and had fought, and very well de&s;erved of
the Parliament be|fore; and therefore they were rather of Opi|nion, that
<HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> finding more of their Inten|tions, who managed the great
De&s;ign in the Hou&s;e of Commons, than was at fir&s;t imparted to him, he
&s;aw no Way would bring the leading Members in both Hou&s;es to a Compliance
with the King, in tho&s;e peaceable Propo&s;itions his Maje&s;ty made to them,
by his Letters, not only after <HI>Waller</HI>'s Defeat at <HI>Cropredy,</HI>
but after his &s;ignal Victory in <HI>Cornwal,</HI> than by keeping things as
near as his Excellency could, in an equal Ba|lance. However, it was generally
known, that <PB N="113" REF="134"> there were great De&s;igns again&s;t
<HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> many being very de&s;irous to remove him from his Sta|tion
of General, upon their Jealou&s;y that he was too much inclined to Peace, tho'
we found no &s;uch thing from him, neither had the Parlia|ment any Rea&s;on to
believe it; for, by rai&s;ing the Siege of <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> which
<HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> had done with great Dexterity, he did the Parliament &s;o
great Service, that they could never &s;ufficiently acknowledge it; that Siege
having been one of the greate&s;t Misfortunes that happened to King
<HI>Charles,</HI> during the War; and tho&s;e who advi&s;ed the King to it,
either thro' Ignorance or Malice, did more Mi&s;chief to the King's Affairs,
than the greate&s;t of his Enemies: For if the King had marched towards
<HI>London,</HI> when he &s;at down before <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> he had, in
all hu|man Appearance, made an End of the War. But this King was very ill
&s;erved in his Wars, thro' too much Fire and Heat in &s;ome of his Generals,
by their frequent Factions among them&s;elves, wherein the King found
Difficulty enough to reconcile them, even where he was in Per&s;on, and divers
&s;udden Changes were made afterwards, which proved very di&s;advan|tageous to
the King. This was the Time, when really tho&s;e that wi&s;hed well to the
King, yet &s;acrificed his Security to their Animo&s;ities again&s;t each
other, without any De&s;ign of Treachery, but to the King's irreparable
Da|mage: A Time, in which Want of Di&s;cretion produced as much Mi&s;chief as
the mo&s;t plain Villainy; for the King &s;uffered as much by 
<PB N="114" REF="135"> the Faction of his Coun&s;ellours, by their not
fore&s;eeing what was evident, and by their Jea|lou&s;ies of what was not like
to be; they often deliberated too long without Re&s;olution, and as often
re&s;olved without deliberating, and ne|ver executed rigorou&s;ly what was
re&s;olved up|on; and all went to wreck by Negligence, In|advertency, and
Dejection of Spirit. It was in this Year that the Queen was delivered at
<HI>Exeter</HI> of the Prince&s;s <HI>Henrietta Maria,</HI> who was put into
the Hands of the Lady <HI>Dalkeith</HI>; after which the Queen took Shipping at
<HI>Pen|dennis</HI> Ca&s;tle in <HI>Cornwal,</HI> and arrived &s;afely in
<HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Before the King left <HI>Buconnock</HI> in <HI>Cornwal,</HI>
&s;everal Addre&s;&s;es were made to him in the Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI>'s Behalf;
but the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> being then Secretary of State, &s;till delayed the
Bu&s;ine&s;s; the Lord <HI>Wilmot,</HI> in the mean time, being fir&s;t &s;ent
Pri&s;oner to <HI>Exeter,</HI> from thence to <HI>Barn&s;table.</HI> At la&s;t,
upon the King's being daily importuned in that Affair, the Lord <HI>Digby</HI>
gave this An&s;wer from the King, and that they were to expect no other, which
was as follows. <HI>That, upon the Earl of</HI> E&s;&s;ex<HI>'s marching
into</HI> Cornwal, <HI>it was re&s;olved at a Cabinet Council, where the
Lord</HI> Wilmot <HI>was, That the King &s;hould write with his own Hand to the
Earl of</HI> E&s;&s;ex, <HI>offering him what Conditions he plea&s;ed, if he
would lay down his Arms, come to the King, and leave his Army to the King's
Mercy; and it was preci&s;ely ordered by the King in Coun|cil, that no Per&s;on
&s;hould take Notice of that</HI> <PB N="115" REF="136"> <HI>Letter, or &s;end
any Me&s;&s;age to the Earl of</HI> E&s;&s;ex: <HI>That, notwith&s;tanding this
particular Command of the King's, the Lord</HI> Wilmot <HI>bid him that carried
the Letter, to remember his Service to the Earl of</HI> E&s;&s;ex,
<HI>de&s;iring he would lay hold of the Opportunity then offered, a&s;&s;u|ring
him the King &s;hould make good his Word, and that he</HI> (<HI>the Lord</HI>
Wilmot) <HI>would take Care the Courtiers &s;hould not hinder it, nor car|ry
things as they had done.</HI> Upon this An&s;wer the Officers gave over their
Pur&s;uit of any farther Addre&s;&s;es, and the Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI> was no
farther que&s;tioned, but went into <HI>France</HI> at the End of the War, and
was the chief Per&s;on that &s;aved the Life of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. after
his Defeat at <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> and carried him &s;afe into
<HI>France,</HI> and was in great E&s;teem with that King, even to his Death;
and his Di&s;grace under King <HI>Charles</HI> I. was look'd upon purely as an
Effect of the Power General <HI>Goring</HI> had at that time with the King, who
had certainly all <HI>Wilmot</HI>'s Faults, but wanted his Regularity, and
pre&s;erving his Re&s;pects with the Officers. <HI>Wilmot</HI> always &s;hut
Debauchery out of his Bu|&s;ine&s;s, never neglected that, and &s;o rarely
mi&s;|carried in it: <HI>Goring</HI> had a &s;harper Wit, and much a keener
Courage and Pre&s;ence of Mind in Danger, in which <HI>Wilmot</HI> could not
behave him&s;elf &s;o well, and therefore warily declined it, as he did near
<HI>Southam,</HI> at the Beginning of the War, when the King was near
<HI>Coventry,</HI> before his Standard was &s;et up; and for mi&s;&s;ing that
Opportunity of Fighting, his Lord&s;hip <PB N="116" REF="137"> was much blamed.
<HI>Wilmot</HI> never drank, when he was within Di&s;tance of an Enemy, and
<HI>Goring</HI> &s;eldom or never refu&s;ed it, and could not re&s;i&s;t
Temptations; and therefore he had always much Company, and few Friends, and he
loved no Man &s;o well, but he would cozen him, and then laugh at him for being
cozened.</P>
<P>About this Time, General <HI>Goring</HI> was &s;ent for with his
Forces to the King, and upon his fir&s;t coming, lying at <HI>Bampton in the
Bu&s;h,</HI> he defeated the Enemy, which gave him &s;uch Re|putation, that he
was &s;ent into the We&s;t with full Power as Generali&s;&s;imo, and General of
all the Hor&s;e of <HI>England.</HI> His Excellency then went to
<HI>Taunton,</HI> and be&s;ieged it, which Place was reduced to &s;ome
Nece&s;&s;ity, when Collonel <HI>Graves</HI> came to relieve it: Whereupon the
Ge|neral drew up the Hills, whil&s;t <HI>Graves</HI> put &s;ome Recruits and
Provi&s;ions into the Town. At the &s;ame time the General &s;ent Sir <HI>John
Digby,</HI> Major General of the Hor&s;e, with a great Detachment, to fall upon
Collonel <HI>Graves</HI> in his Retreat; in which Action Sir <HI>John
Dig|by</HI> had good Succe&s;s, and took many Pri&s;oners: But being &s;hot in
the Arm, he was &s;ent to <HI>Bridg|water,</HI> to be cured; but his Arm
gangrened, and he there died, to the great Regret of the Army, and of all that
knew him. So &s;oon as <HI>Graves</HI> was retired, General <HI>Goring</HI>
drew down his Army again to be&s;iege <HI>Taunton,</HI> which put the
Garri&s;on into greater Con&s;ternation than before, believing the King mu&s;t
have had &s;ome extraordinary Succe&s;s, which made our Gene|ral 
<PB N="117" REF="138"> take tho&s;e Mea&s;ures. We pre&s;&s;ed them &s;o hard,
that we were like to be &s;oon Ma&s;ters of the Place, but that an unlucky
Accident hap|pened, of Sir <HI>William Courtney</HI>'s and Collonel
<HI>Thornhill</HI>'s falling foul upon each other, in|&s;tead of the Enemy,
which was a great Misfor|tune; and tho' the Governour, <HI>Blague,</HI>
defen|ded the Place very bravely, we were likely to be Ma&s;ters of it in a
very little time.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t not forget, that, after the Defeat in
<HI>Cornwal,</HI> the King &s;taying &s;ome time in the We&s;tern Parts,
<HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> got together another Ar|my, and being joined with
<HI>Waller</HI> and <HI>Man|che&s;ter,</HI> was then &s;o &s;trong, that he
hoped to take his Revenge, and encompa&s;s the King, who was then going to
<HI>Oxford,</HI> taking <HI>Newbury</HI> in his Way. <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> with
his Army, had made his Rendezvous in <HI>Aldermar&s;ton</HI> Park, belonging to
Sir <HI>Humphrey Fo&s;ter</HI>; from whence he came more &s;uddenly upon us
than we expected, which put us into &s;ome Confu&s;ion. They attacked us at the
&s;ame time in &s;everal Places, with diffe|rent Succe&s;s, being much
&s;tronger than we; and when they could not prevail in one Place, they attack'd
us in another, hoping in the End to &s;urround us: So that there was fighting
at the &s;ame time in &s;everal Places, in mo&s;t of which the Enemy prevailed,
and we retired, and were upon the Defen&s;ive in all Parts. Upon the We&s;t
Side of <HI>Spine</HI> they pre&s;&s;ed us very hard, where young Sir <HI>John
Greenvil</HI> was po&s;ted up|on a high Ri&s;ing Ground, with &s;ome Foot and
Cannon, with a &s;mall Retrenchment before him: <PB N="118" REF="139"> General
<HI>Goring</HI> being then on that Side, and &s;ee|ing the Enemy intended to
attack that Place with Hor&s;e and Foot, to prevent which, he re&s;olved to
charge their Hor&s;e with the Earl of <HI>Cleveland</HI>'s Brigade, which was
then drawn up on that Side, which was done accordingly: But the Earl of
<HI>Cleveland</HI> engaging his Per&s;on too far, was there taken Pri&s;oner,
and then a great Body of the Enemy's Foot advanced in good Order upon Sir
<HI>John Greenvil,</HI> forced him from that Po&s;t, with the Lo&s;s of &s;ome
Men and Cannon, and him&s;elf wounded in the Head with a Sword in this Action.
Upon this Succe&s;s, the Enemy pur&s;ued furiou&s;ly, and the Fight continued
very hot, the Enemy &s;till advancing: Where|upon I was commanded by General
<HI>Goring,</HI> to bring up the Queen's Regiment of Hor&s;e, which was then in
Re&s;erve, commanded by Sir <HI>John Cansfield,</HI> who charged them &s;o
home, that he &s;topp'd their Career, and obliged them to re|treat, which gave
&s;ome breathing Time to our Troops on that Side; but in this Action Sir
<HI>John Cansfield</HI> had one of his Legs &s;hot and broken: And while we
were thus fighting on that Side of <HI>Spine, Manche&s;ter,</HI> with his
Ar|my, attacked Mr. <HI>Doleman</HI>'s Hou&s;e at <HI>Shaw,</HI> below the
Ca&s;tle, where there was a &s;harp En|gagement all that Afternoon, and the
Garden was warmly attacked, and as well defended, by the Collonels
<HI>Li&s;le</HI> and <HI>Thelwell,</HI> with the Help of Sir <HI>Thomas
Hooper</HI>'s Dragoons; and a little before the Evening, Sir <HI>John
Brown,</HI> with the Prince's Regiment of Hor&s;e, charged the Ene|my 
<PB N="119" REF="140"> &s;o bri&s;kly, that he obliged them to retreat up the
Hill, with the Lo&s;s of &s;ome Colours, and two Field Pieces of Cannon. Thus
the Fight continued on all Sides, till the Night parted us. The King &s;tayed
in the Field till Midnight, that all our Cannon were drawn within the Walls of
<HI>Dennington</HI> Ca&s;tle, for their Security, and then General
<HI>Goring,</HI> with mo&s;t of the Army, marched that Night towards
<HI>Oxford,</HI> without any Alarm from the Enemy, who dur&s;t not follow us,
and the King went to <HI>Bri&s;tol.</HI> The next Day, after our Retreat,
<HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;s'd him&s;elf very quietly of <HI>Newbury,</HI>
making little Doubt of taking <HI>Dennington</HI> Ca|&s;tle, which was thrice
&s;ummoned, and as often &s;tormed, but without Succe&s;s; and finding it would
be a Work of Time, and nothing was to be got there but Blows, he retired with
his Army, and quitted <HI>Newbury</HI>; to which Place General <HI>Goring</HI>
&s;oon came again, relieved the Ca&s;tle with what was wanting, and brought off
all our Cannon.</P>
<P>The Parliament finding that <HI>Newbury</HI> was quitted, not only
without, but again&s;t their Order, and all the Cannon brought away from
<HI>Dennington</HI> Ca&s;tle, tho' the Parliament Armies were more than double
to the Number of the King's, they were much di&s;plea&s;ed at the Pro|ceedings
of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> which being joined with great A&s;per&s;ions of his ill
Conduct in <HI>Cornwal,</HI> made the Parliament re&s;olve to new model their
Army, which they would do with great Policy, by Degrees, that the le&s;s Notice
might be taken <PB N="120" REF="141"> of it. In order to this, they fir&s;t
made a Self-denying Ordinance (as they called it) that after &s;uch a prefixed
Time (which was then declared) no Member of either Hou&s;e of Par|liament
&s;hould enjoy any Office either Civil or Military.</P>
<P>The Winter following this Year, General <HI>Goring</HI> was
quartered at <HI>Bruton</HI> in <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire,</HI> at Sir <HI>Charles
Berkeley</HI>'s, a great inclo&s;ed Coun|try, where the Villages were thick,
and great Store of Forage For Hor&s;e. Sir <HI>William Waller</HI> was then
quartered at <HI>Salisbury</HI> in <HI>Wilt&s;hire,</HI> where the Villages are
thin, &s;tanding only in the Valleys, &s;ome Di&s;tance from each other.
General <HI>Goring</HI> taking this Advantage, &s;ent out Parties, almo&s;t
every Night, to beat up the Enemy's Quarters in <HI>Wilt&s;hire,</HI> which was
done with &s;uch good Succe&s;s, that in a &s;hort time we took many
Pri&s;oners and Colours, which occa|&s;ioned <HI>Waller</HI> to write this
en&s;uing Letter to General <HI>Goring. Noble Lord, God's Ble&s;&s;ing he on
your Heart, you are the jollie&s;t Neighbour I have ever met with: I wi&s;h for
nothing more, but an Opportunity to let you know, I would not be behind in this
kind of Courte&s;y. In the mean time, if your Lord&s;hip plea&s;e to relea&s;e
&s;uch Pri&s;oners as you have of mine, for the like Num|ber and Quality that I
have of yours, I &s;hall e&s;teem it as a great Civility, being your
Lord|&s;hip's mo&s;t Humble and Obedient Servant,</HI></P>
<P>William Waller.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="142">This Letter was brought by a Trumpeter, who
had been often with us, and was well known to us, and was a good plea&s;ant
Droll; and whil&s;t we were at Dinner in the General's Quarters, a Party of
Hor&s;e returned, with five Colours, and &s;everal Pri&s;oners of Collonel
<HI>Popham</HI>'s Regiment, who&s;e Quarters were beaten up the Night before.
Upon this the General &s;ent for the Trumpeter into the Room, where we were at
Dinner, to &s;hew him the Colours, and the principal Pri&s;oners: Whereupon the
Trumpeter pre&s;&s;ed his Excellency to di&s;patch him back with his An&s;wer,
fearing, if he &s;hould &s;tay longer, that <HI>Waller</HI> him&s;elf might be
taken, before he, the Trumpeter, could reach <HI>Salisbu|ry</HI>; and &s;o he
was di&s;patched with this An&s;wer from the General: <HI>That if Sir</HI>
William Waller <HI>had Authority, and could nominate two Officers of Quality,
of his Army, to meet two Officers of the like Quality, of General</HI>
Goring<HI>'s Army, at any convenient Place between both Armies, they &s;hould
be empowered to exchange all Pri&s;o|ners on both Sides, of equal Quality, from
the</HI> Lands-End <HI>in</HI> Cornwal, <HI>to</HI> Port&s;mouth <HI>in</HI>
Hamp|&s;hire: Which Sir <HI>William Waller</HI> willingly ac|cepted, and
accordingly named Collonel <HI>Ennis,</HI> his Adjutant General, and Major
<HI>Butler,</HI> who was Major to <HI>Waller</HI>'s own Regiment, and de&s;ired
<HI>Shaftsbury</HI> might be the Place of Meeting. To this the General
willingly con&s;ented, and &s;ent a Pa&s;s by the &s;ame Trumpeter, for the
Per&s;ons na|med by Sir <HI>William Waller,</HI> and at the &s;ame time
nominated me with Sir <HI>Bernard Ga&s;coigne,</HI> Ma|jor 
<PB N="122" REF="143"> to his own Regiment, Commi&s;&s;ioners from his
Excellency: And accordingly a Pa&s;s was &s;ent us forthwith from Sir
<HI>William Waller,</HI> and the Time appointed for our Meeting at
<HI>Shafts|bury,</HI> to which Place we all came the &s;ame Day with our
Servants, and Trumpeters with each. The Country People believing we were
appoin|ted to make a Peace, flocked in great Numbers to <HI>Shaftsbury,</HI>
where we &s;tayed fifteen Days, to relea&s;e all Pri&s;oners of Quality on both
Sides, from the <HI>Lands-End</HI> in the We&s;t, to <HI>Port&s;mouth.</HI> Sir
<HI>William Waller</HI> &s;ent us a great Pre&s;ent of Wines, which came from
<HI>London,</HI> believing we could have none &s;uch el&s;ewhere. We then
appointed all our Pri&s;oners to be brought to <HI>Wareham</HI> in
<HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire,</HI> and all the Pri&s;oners of the Parliament's Side, to
be brought to <HI>Chri&s;t-Church</HI> in <HI>Hamp&s;hire</HI>; and Sir
<HI>Bernard Ga&s;coigne</HI> went to <HI>Wareham,</HI> to receive our
Pri&s;oners, and Major <HI>Butler</HI> went to <HI>Chri&s;t-Church,</HI> to
receive the Parliament's. Collonel <HI>Ennis</HI> returned to
<HI>Salisbury,</HI> and I came back to <HI>Bruton,</HI> to give the Generals an
Account of what we had done.</P>
<P>Now, the King having often &s;ollicited the Parliament for Peace,
even after both his Victories, at <HI>Cropredy</HI> Bridge, and in
<HI>Cornwal,</HI> and the Parliament &s;eeing the general In|clination of the
People and City of <HI>London</HI> bend that way, that they might &s;eem at
lea&s;t to have the &s;ame De&s;ires for the Good of the Na|tion, (tho' it
plainly appeared they otherwi&s;e intended) the Parliament, with the Con&s;ent
of the Commi&s;&s;ioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> pre&s;ent &s;ome 
<PB N="123" REF="144"> Propo&s;itions to the King, which they de&s;ire may be
treated on at <HI>Uxbridge:</HI> To which Treaty the King &s;oon agreed, when
it was well known the Parliament never intended to come to an Agreement, by
their mo&s;t irrational and unju&s;t Demands, which they knew, the King could
neither in Rea&s;on, Honour, or Con&s;ci|ence, grant; and &s;o the Treaty was
&s;oon bro|ken, to the King's great Di&s;&s;atisfaction, who then clearly
&s;aw, the Parliament was re&s;olved to pro&s;ecute the War again&s;t him, to
the la&s;t Extremity.</P>
<P>About this time, the great De&s;igns again&s;t <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>
began to appear, who was much &s;u&s;pected by tho&s;e who de&s;igned to
de&s;troy both Govern|ment, Mini&s;try, and Magi&s;tracy, and re&s;olved to
remove the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> from his Command, and took Re&s;olutions
to put the Self-denying Ordinance in Execution: But <HI>E&s;&s;ex,
Manche|&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Denbigh,</HI> forthwith &s;urrendered their
Commi&s;&s;ions; the &s;ame did likewi&s;e the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> their
Admiral, they being all fully per&s;waded, by the Parliament's Procee|ding,
that they intended to perpetuate them|&s;elves, and the u&s;urped Government of
the three Nations, and to make them&s;elves a free State, under a
Pre&s;byterian Government. But the Parliament were much mi&s;taken in their
Policy, and were &s;oon deprived of their main De&s;ign, and quickly lo&s;t all
that Dominion which they &s;o eagerly de&s;ired, and &s;o long ga|ped for, it
being pre&s;ently &s;natched out of their Hands, by the Independent Party, who
were <PB N="124" REF="145"> newly &s;prung up out of their own Bowels: For
notwith&s;tanding their Self-Denying Ordinance, <HI>Cromwell</HI> was
di&s;pen&s;ed with to hold his Com|mand of Lieutenant General to Sir <HI>Thomas
Fairfax,</HI> who was made General of their new modelled Army, who&s;e fir&s;t
Rendezvous was at <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> where they did their own Bu&s;ine&s;s,
and quite ruined the King's.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Succe&s;s by this new modelled Ar|my was performed by
<HI>Cromwell,</HI> who wa&s;ting the Country with a Body of Hor&s;e, fell
unex|pectedly upon a Party at <HI>I&s;lip</HI> Bridge, comman|ded by the Earl
of <HI>Northampton,</HI> who were defeated, and &s;ome Pri&s;oners taken, and
the Remainder pur&s;ued to <HI>Bleckington Hou&s;e,</HI> four Miles from
<HI>Oxford,</HI> where Collonel <HI>Windebank</HI> was &s;ettled for &s;ome
time, with a &s;mall Party of Hor&s;e and Foot. <HI>Cromwell</HI> pre&s;ently
&s;ummo|ned the Hou&s;e, which had only a Wall about it; the Governour
forthwith &s;urrendered it, and had Articles to retire to <HI>Oxford</HI>;
where be|ing called to a Council of War, he was con|demned, and &s;hot to
Death, for delivering it &s;o &s;oon to a Party of Hor&s;e only, when he might
have had &s;peedy A&s;&s;i&s;tance from <HI>Oxford,</HI> which was but four
Miles from <HI>Bleckington.</HI></P>
<P>About this time, General <HI>Goring</HI> was at the Siege of
<HI>Taunton,</HI> of which he was in great Hopes &s;oon to be Ma&s;ter, (at
lea&s;t he made us all believe &s;o) when he received Letters from the King
(&s;ome Days before his taking of <HI>Lei|ce&s;ter</HI>) commanding him to quit
the Siege of <HI>Taunton,</HI> and ha&s;ten to him with his Army, 
<PB N="125" REF="146"> fearing the Enemy would be too &s;trong for him: To
which I wrote the General's An&s;wer to the King, having kept the Copy of it,
which was to this Effect. <HI>That he was certain, in few Days, to be Ma&s;ter
of</HI> Taunton, <HI>and &s;hould leave that Country free from any Enemy,
excep|ting</HI> Lyme <HI>(which was then, and had been for &s;ome Time blocked
up;) whereas, if he &s;hould leave the Siege, the Enemy would be Ma&s;ters of
that Country; and therefore he mo&s;t humbly prayed the King, to forbear any
Engagement, and to be upon the Defen&s;ive, upon the River of</HI> Trent,
<HI>which he might very well do, till the Siege of</HI> Taunton <HI>was ended,
and then he would bring his Army to &s;erve the King to his be&s;t Advantage;
and he did again de&s;ire the King to keep at a Di&s;tance, and not
engage.</HI> But the taking of <HI>Leice&s;ter</HI> being a great Lo&s;s to the
Parliament, and of &s;uch Advantage to the King, that his Maje&s;ty then wrote
to the Queen, that he might (without being too much &s;anguine) af|firm, that,
&s;ince the Rebellion began, his Affairs were never in &s;o hopeful a Way; and
indeed the Parliament was then likewi&s;e of the &s;ame Opi|nion. But this
Letter from the General being intercepted by <HI>Fairfax,</HI> cau&s;ed his
&s;udden Ad|vance from his Rendezvous at <HI>Brickhill,</HI> to &s;end in great
Ha&s;te for <HI>Cromwell,</HI> who was gone into the I&s;le of <HI>Ely,</HI>
upon who&s;e Return a Re&s;olu|tion was taken to engage the King forthwith to a
Battle, before the Lo&s;s of <HI>Taunton,</HI> and that General <HI>Goring</HI>
&s;hould arrive with his Army. Now, the King, not having Advice from Ge|neral 
<PB N="126" REF="147"> <HI>Goring,</HI> by his Letter being intercepted, and
both his and his Soldiers Spirits being much heightened by taking of
<HI>Leice&s;ter,</HI> and the King hearing the Enemy was advancing to|wards
him, a Council was forthwith called at Midnight, where it was re&s;olved to
give the Enemy Battle the next Day; to which the King then prepared, and had in
all Appearance gained a Victory, if Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> (who was &s;ome|time
before made Lieutenant General of all the King's Armies, in Place of the Earl
of <HI>Brentford</HI>) had not, after his u&s;ual Manner, having defeated the
Enemy's left Wing, pur&s;ued furiou&s;ly &s;o far, as to leave the Foot naked,
who were &s;everely fallen upon by the Enemy's Re&s;erve of Hor&s;e, who had
put them in great Di&s;order, and the whole Army was almo&s;t to|tally broken,
before the Prince came back to to their Relief, tho' the King in Per&s;on (to
the great Hazard of his Life) did all that po&s;&s;ibly could be done by
Valour, in rallying his Hor&s;e, and endeavouring to maintain the Battle; but
&s;eeing all lo&s;t, the King was forced to fly to|wards <HI>Leice&s;ter,</HI>
for his own Safety, leaving the Enemy wholly Ma&s;ters of the Field. The Lo&s;s
of all was Prince <HI>Rupert</HI>'s pur&s;uing the Hor&s;e, which he had
beaten, who&s;e natural Heat and Impatience was &s;uch, that he could not
endure the Enemy in View, nor would he believe the Enemy had Courage to endure
his Charge; and thus the Army was engaged, be|fore the Cannon was turned, or
the Ground made choice of, upon which they were to fight: <PB N="127" REF="148"> So that Courage was only to be relied on, where all Conduct failed.
However, if the King had then gone directly into the We&s;t, where he had an
Army ready formed, and People generally devoted to his Service, in&s;tead of
amu&s;ing him|&s;elf about forming a new Army in Countries worn out with the
Oppre&s;&s;ion of his own Troops, and the Licence of their Governours, he might
have given the Enemy a great Interruption, if not re&s;tored his Affairs. Thus
this fatal Battle of <HI>Na&s;eby,</HI> fought the 14th of <HI>June,</HI>
proved the entire Ruine of all the King's Affairs. The King, after this Battle,
fled from Place to Place, not well knowing which Way to turn him&s;elf: At
la&s;t he came to <HI>Newark,</HI> where he received a new Mortification from
his Subjects then in Arms for him, much &s;harper than any he had received from
the Enemy, which he &s;uffered with more Grief and Perplexity of Mind. Prince
<HI>Rupert</HI> and Prince <HI>Maurice,</HI> after the Lo&s;s of the We&s;t and
<HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> were at <HI>Belvoir</HI> Ca&s;tle, where the King commanded
them to &s;tay, and not to follow him to <HI>Newark</HI>; but, contrary to the
King's Commands, they both came thither, and Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> told his
Ma|je&s;ty, he was come to give an Account of the Lo&s;s of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI>
and to clear him&s;elf from tho&s;e Imputations that had been ca&s;t upon him
for the Surrender of that Place. Tho' the King was di&s;plea&s;ed with the
Prince's coming thither, contrary to his Orders, he was yet re&s;olved to hear
Prince <HI>Rupert</HI>'s Defence, who had promi|&s;ed the King to hold
<HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> at lea&s;t four Months, <PB N="128" REF="149"> and yet gave
it up almo&s;t in as few Days: And he told Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> that he did
really be|lieve, the Prince had no De&s;ign again&s;t his Ser|vice, and that he
would command a Declaration to be drawn up, by which the Prince &s;hould be
ab&s;olved from any Di&s;loyalty, either in that, or any other Action of the
War; but that in Truth he could not ab&s;olve him of Indi&s;cretion in the
Delivery of <HI>Bri&s;tol.</HI> The King re&s;olved to retreat from
<HI>Newark</HI> towards <HI>Oxford,</HI> becau&s;e the Enemy were on the North
Side of <HI>Trent,</HI> but he imparted his Re&s;olution to none; except to two
or three of the neare&s;t Tru&s;t about him; and finding great Differences grow
betwixt Sir <HI>Richard Willis,</HI> the Governour, and the Gentlemen of the
Country, who were firm to him, and who&s;e Intere&s;t alone had pre&s;erved
that Place; and finding no Way to pre&s;erve that Garri&s;on, but by Removal of
the Gover|nour, he &s;ent for him into his Bed-chamber, and after many gracious
Expre&s;&s;ions of the Sa|tisfaction he had received in his Service, he told
him, his De&s;ign was to go that Night, and to take him with him, and to make
him Captain of his Guards, in Place of the Earl of <HI>Litch|field,</HI> who
was lately killed near <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> and would leave Collonel
<HI>Bella&s;is</HI> Governour there, who being allied to mo&s;t of the Gentry
of the adjacent Counties, would be more acceptable to them; and that he could
not give a more ample Ju&s;tification of his Services, and of his Satis|faction
in them, than by the Honour and Tru&s;t he conferred upon him. Sir <HI>Richard
Willis</HI> <PB N="129" REF="150"> appeared much troubled, and excu&s;ed his
taking the other Command, as a Place of too great Honour, and that his Fortune
could not maintain him in that Employment, and &s;aid, his Enemies would
triumph in his Removal. The King told him, he would take Care and provide for
his Support, and &s;o went out of his Chamber to Church; and after his Return,
being at Dinner, Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> Prince <HI>Mau|rice,</HI> Lord
<HI>Gerard,</HI> and Sir <HI>Richard Willis,</HI> with about Twenty Officers of
the Garri&s;on, came into the Pre&s;ence-Chamber, where Sir <HI>Richard
Willis</HI> addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the King, and told him, it was the
publick Talk of the Town, that he was di&s;graced, and turned out from his
Government; and Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> added, Sir <HI>Richard Willis</HI> was
to be removed from his Go|vernment, for no other Fault, but for being his
Friend. The Lord <HI>Gerard</HI> &s;aid, it was a Plot of the Lord
<HI>Digby,</HI> who was a Traitor, and he would prove him to be &s;o. The King
was &s;o much &s;urprized at the&s;e extravagant and in&s;olent Di&s;cour&s;es,
that he ro&s;e from Dinner in great Di&s;order, and retiring into his
Bed|chamber, he called Sir <HI>Richard Willis</HI> to follow him, who
an&s;wered loudly, that he had re|ceived a publick Injury, and expected a
publick Satisfaction. This &s;o provoked his Maje&s;ty, that, with much greater
Indignation than ever he was &s;een po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with, he commanded them
to depart his Pre&s;ence, and to come no more into it; and this with &s;uch
Circum&s;tances in his Looks and Ge&s;ture, as well as Words, that 
<PB N="130" REF="151"> they appeared no le&s;s confounded, and departed the
Room, a&s;hamed of what they had done: Yet &s;o &s;oon as they came to the
Governour's Hou&s;e, they &s;ounded to Hor&s;e, intending to be pre&s;ently
gone; but &s;oon after they &s;ent to the King for Pa&s;&s;es, who gave them
&s;uch as they de&s;ired, and &s;ent them, and declared Collonel
<HI>Bella&s;is</HI> Governour of <HI>Newark,</HI> but forgot at the &s;ame time
to have hanged up Sir <HI>Richard Willis,</HI> for his in&s;olent Carriage
towards his Sovereign.</P>
<P>After this the King went to <HI>Oxford,</HI> &s;ent &s;everal
Me&s;&s;ages for Peace, and for a pre&s;ent Treaty; that he would come to
<HI>London,</HI> and put him&s;elf into their Hands: But nothing would be
accepted. And tho' he tried to deal with the Independants, yet it was in vain;
the King's ill Succe&s;s run on in a continued Series, in this Year 1645, he
lo&s;t more in three Months than he had gotten before in three Years. The
<HI>French</HI> &s;eemed glad of the&s;e Di&s;orders among&s;t us, Cardinal
<HI>Richlieu</HI> having had an implacable Malice and Hatred to
<HI>England,</HI> ever &s;ince the I&s;le of <HI>Rhee</HI> Voyage, and the
declared Protecti|on of <HI>Rochel</HI> again&s;t the King; and he being now
dead, and Cardinal <HI>Mazarin</HI> in his Place, an <HI>Italian,</HI> who
&s;eemed very kind to the Queen, but yet gave very little and ordinary
Supplies, that he might a little continue the Struggle; but he was more
&s;ollicitous to keep a good Corre|&s;pondence with the Parliament, and to
profe&s;s a Neutrality betwixt the King and the Parlia|ment, by means of
<HI>Don Alonzo de Cardinas,</HI> <PB N="131" REF="152"> the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
Amba&s;&s;ador, who made all his Ad|dre&s;&s;es to the Parliament. But that
which put a Period to all our King's Hopes, was the De|feating the Lord
<HI>A&s;tley</HI> near <HI>Stow in the Wold,</HI> who was taken Pri&s;oner with
&s;everal other Offi|cers, and were all either killed or di&s;per&s;ed, as they
were coming from <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> to <HI>Oxford,</HI> which hindred the
King from drawing any other Troops into the Field; and being now in the Ebb of
his good Fortunes, he thought it in vain to expect a Treaty with his
Parliament, who, in the Height of his good Succe&s;s, would li&s;ten to no
Rea&s;on: Yet, to &s;atisfy his Friends, who were generally inclined to Peace,
he &s;ent a Me&s;&s;age to his Parliament, full of tender Ex|pre&s;&s;ions,
&s;etting forth his deep Sen&s;e of the Nation's Mi&s;eries, by the&s;e civil
Di&s;tractions among&s;t them, and conjured them, as they would an&s;wer it to
Almighty God, in that Day when he &s;hould make Inqui&s;ition for Blood, which
had, or might be &s;pilt, in that unnatu|ral War; and as they tendred the
Pre&s;ervation of their Religion, by all the Bonds of Duty and Allegiance to
their King, of Compa&s;&s;ion for their bleeding Country, or Charity to
them|&s;elves, to di&s;po&s;e their Hearts to a true Sen&s;e, and to employ
their Faculties to a more &s;erious Endeavour, together with his Maje&s;ty, to
put a &s;peedy End to the&s;e wa&s;ting Divi&s;ions, and to make both King and
People happy. But this Me&s;&s;age produced nothing, but much more in|&s;olent
Propo&s;itions than tho&s;e at <HI>Uxbridge</HI>; and it was in vain for the
King to expo&s;tulate with <PB N="132" REF="153"> them who were re&s;olved not
to give him any rea&s;onable Satisfaction: And tho' the Hou&s;e of Lords was
willing to corre&s;pond with the King's De&s;ires, yet they were over-ruled and
curbed by the Commons, the Lords then &s;tanding but as Cyphers, and were
forced by the Commons into a Compliance, in whatever they de&s;ired or
determined; and if the Lords di&s;&s;ented to any Particular, they would do it
without them, the active Commons doing all things at their Plea|&s;ure: Which
did &s;ufficiently demon&s;trate, that they had no Intention to come to any
Agreement of Peace, but to pur&s;ue their De&s;igns to the uttermo&s;t Round of
the Ladder; and having once drawn their Swords again&s;t their lawful Prince,
to throw away the Scabbard, knowing their Crimes could not be &s;afe, but by
attempt|ing greater: And tho' the De&s;ign was hatched in the Hou&s;e of
Commons, for the Extirpation of Monarchy, yet I really believe the tenth Part
of them never knew, nor thought, that the Bu&s;ine&s;s would go &s;o far, as at
la&s;t it did, they looking no farther than the bare Out&s;ide of Things, which
carried a fair Shew and Glo&s;s, to fight for King and Parliament, and were
in|&s;en&s;ibly drawn in by the In&s;inuation of the prevailing Party.</P>
<P>The King found all his Endeavours for Peace &s;ignified nothing,
that the Commons were re|&s;olved upon his Ruine, and that nothing would
&s;erve but his Submi&s;&s;ion to all they demanded, again&s;t which he was
ab&s;olutely re&s;olved, it being his Obligation in Honour and Con&s;cience, 
<PB N="133" REF="154"> not to abandon a ju&s;t Cau&s;e, nor injure his
Suc|ce&s;&s;or, nor for&s;ake his Friends; and therefore expected no other
Succe&s;s, but to end his Days with Honour and a good Con&s;cience, and did
&s;eriou&s;ly avow, as appeared by his Letter to Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI>
wherein he freely told the Prince, that tho&s;e who would &s;tay with him, were
to expect and re&s;olve, either to die for a good Cau&s;e, or, which was
wor&s;e, to live as mi&s;erable in maintaining it, as the In&s;olence of
in&s;ulting Rebels could make them.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I knew not General <HI>Goring,</HI> till he
came to the King in <HI>Cornwal,</HI> after the Battle of
<HI>Mar&s;ton-Moor,</HI> but I have heard great Reflections made upon his
Conduct in the Bu&s;i|ne&s;s of <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> of which he was
Gover|nour in the Beginning of the War; and mo&s;t wondered why the King would
employ him, being made General of all the Hor&s;e in <HI>England,</HI> and
Generali&s;&s;imo in the We&s;t, both of Hor&s;e and Foot. But I believe he had
done &s;ome ex|traordinary Service for our King in <HI>France,</HI> before he
came over with the Queen; and I have been informed from good Hands, that he did
not only procure great Store of Arms and Ammunition, but furni&s;hed the Queen
al&s;o with a con&s;iderable Sum of Money, which he got by his Dexterity and
Cunning; which pre|vailed &s;o much with the King, that, by the Queen's
Interce&s;&s;ion, he gave him tho&s;e great Commands, which made a mighty
Noi&s;e in the Army, and gave great Di&s;content to many. As to his Per&s;on, I
had as much Rea&s;on to know <PB N="134" REF="155"> him as any, and was always
entru&s;ted with his mo&s;t &s;ecret Di&s;patches; and tho' I know his Memory
remains bla&s;ted upon &s;everal Occa&s;ions, yet I cannot but do him this
Right, which com|mon Hone&s;ty obliges me to &s;ay of him: That he was a
Per&s;on of extraordinary Abilities, as well as Courage, and was, without
Di&s;pute, as good an Officer as any &s;erved the King, and the mo&s;t
dexterous, in any &s;udden Emergency, that I have ever &s;een, and could
extricate him&s;elf with the lea&s;t Concern, of which I was a par|ticular
Eye-Witne&s;s upon &s;everal Occa&s;ions in the Siege of <HI>Taunton,</HI>
where Collonel <HI>Blague</HI> the then Governour made many &s;harp and
un|expected Sallies; but he was &s;till repul&s;ed and beaten back with Lo&s;s,
by the Courage and Dexterity of General <HI>Goring,</HI> without which that
Siege had been &s;oon rai&s;ed. But after all that can be &s;aid in General
<HI>Goring</HI>'s Behalf, he had likewi&s;e his blind Side, for he &s;trangely
loved the Bottle, was much given to his Plea|&s;ures, and a great Debauchee;
and the great Misfortune was, when he commanded in chief in the We&s;t of
<HI>England,</HI> his Excellency had two Companions, who commanded next under
him, who fed his wild Humour and Debauch, and one of them, if not both, wanted
his great and natural Courage. The&s;e two Commanders, the one being Lieutenant
General, made the General turn his Wantonne&s;s into Riot, and his Riot into
Madne&s;s: So that if the King had been truly informed of their continued
&s;trange Debauches, his Maje&s;ty would either have re|moved 
<PB N="135" REF="156"> them from him, or all Three from fu|ture Tru&s;t or
Employment: For when Princes give way to the Vices of their Commanders, tho'
they be never &s;o brave Men, they &s;eldom recompen&s;e their Neglects by any
future Dili|gence; for they mu&s;t &s;tand in Awe of the Prince they &s;erve,
or el&s;e the Prince mu&s;t be Servant to their Humour.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the Siege of <HI>Taunton</HI> continued, I confe&s;s
Lieutenant General <HI>Porter</HI> had &s;everal Conferences with the Officers
of the Rebels that were then in that Garri&s;on, to the great Scan|dal of many,
who knew not what Interpreta|tion to make of it; but this being often
practi|&s;ed among the Chiefs of the Army, much No|tice was not taken of it.
About this time Ge|neral <HI>Goring</HI> &s;eemed &s;omething di&s;contented
with the Prince's Council; whereupon Sir <HI>John Berkeley,</HI> Sir <HI>Hugh
Pollard,</HI> and Collonel <HI>A&s;hburnham,</HI> were &s;ent to confer with
General <HI>Goring,</HI> to know particularly what he de&s;ired. Their
Conference was kept very private; how|ever, I was informed, that the General
carried him&s;elf very extravagantly, and that they could not &s;atisfy him.
Sir <HI>Thomas Fairfax</HI> being then coming into the We&s;t again&s;t General
<HI>Goring,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> recommended to him the Garri&s;on
of <HI>Langport,</HI> as being of great Impor|tance for the Security of
<HI>Bridgwater:</HI> But Ge|neral <HI>Goring</HI>'s Troops being quartered
about <HI>Langport,</HI> took away the Contribution a&s;&s;igned for the
Support of it, to &s;upply his own Army, which brought the Garri&s;on &s;o low,
that when <PB N="136" REF="157"> it might have been very advantageous to our
Army, it had very little or no Provi&s;ion in it. And then, to add to our
Mi&s;ery, the Clubmen in <HI>Dor&s;et</HI> and <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire</HI> began
to ri&s;e, and &s;ent Complaints to the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> of the great
Oppre&s;&s;ions and Di&s;orders committed by our Army, which the Prince
promi&s;ed to re|form, and went to General <HI>Goring</HI> about it, &s;etting
forth the great Danger the Country was in, by the Liberty his Troops took to
them|&s;elves. But the General having no Money to give the Army, connived at
the Licence they took, and, at the &s;ame time, to &s;hew his Popu|larity,
&s;ided in many things with the Clubmen, who in the End did us as much
Mi&s;chief as the Power of the Rebels, who, about that time, being towards the
Month of <HI>July,</HI> entered <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire,</HI> and being
&s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and agreed with Sir <HI>Thomas Fairfax,</HI> he be&s;ieged
and took <HI>Sherborn</HI> Ca&s;tle, which was well defended by Sir <HI>Lewis
Dives,</HI> who was there taken Pri&s;oner, with Collonel <HI>Strangeways</HI>
and &s;everal others. After the taking of <HI>Sherborn,</HI> the Parliament
Army advanced towards General <HI>Goring,</HI> who was encamped about
<HI>Langport,</HI> which, by rea|&s;on of the River on the one Side, and the
great Mar&s;h or Bogg betwixt that and <HI>Bridgwater,</HI> was e&s;teemed a
&s;trong Po&s;t, and likewi&s;e to make a good Retreat, in Ca&s;e we were
beaten. The Day before we engaged, the General &s;ent Lieutenant General
<HI>Porter,</HI> with three Brigades of Hor&s;e, on the other Side the River,
farther from the Enemy than we were, and in a Race <PB N="137" REF="158">
Campagne, who had his Quarters beaten up at Noon Day, by General
<HI>Ma&s;&s;ey,</HI> for want of Scouts being out, the Lieutenant General
be|ing then in his utmo&s;t Debauches with &s;ome of his Officers. The Enemy
was &s;een coming from the Hills a Mile before them, and yet was up|on our Men,
before they could get to their Hor&s;es, who were feeding in the Meadows. The
Alarm being brought to General <HI>Goring,</HI> he immediately marched in
Per&s;on to his Suc|cour, rallied the Hor&s;e that were flying, &s;topp'd the
Enemy's Carreer, who were eagerly pur&s;u|ing, and made a hand&s;ome Retreat,
without which the be&s;t Part of our Army had been lo&s;t that Day; and when
our General met Lieute|nant General <HI>Porter</HI> in the Rear flying with the
re&s;t, his Excellency turned to me, and &s;aid, <HI>He de&s;erves to be
pi&s;toll'd for his Negligence or Cowardice</HI>; but being the General's
Brother-in-Law, that Fault was &s;oon forgotten and pardoned: And yet I have
often heard the Ge|neral &s;ay, <HI>That his Brother-in-Law, Lieutenant
General</HI> Porter, <HI>was the be&s;t Company, but the wor&s;t Officer, that
ever &s;erved the King.</HI></P>
<P>After this Beating up of Lieutenant General <HI>Porter</HI>'s
Quarters, <HI>Fairfax,</HI> with his Army, marched directly to us from
<HI>Evil,</HI> where, be|ing a plain and ri&s;ing Ground, the Enemy's Army was
drawn up upon it, with a great Mar&s;h and Bogg between both Armies, which
hindred the Enemy from attacking us, except by one Pa&s;&s;age in the Bottom of
the Hill, between both Armies, which Pa&s;&s;age was narrow, and 
<PB N="138" REF="159"> our General had placed there two Regiments of Foot to
guard that Pa&s;&s;age; which were Collo|nel <HI>Slaughter</HI>'s and Collonel
<HI>Wi&s;e</HI>'s Regiments, lately rai&s;ed in South <HI>Wales.</HI> General
<HI>Goring</HI> him&s;elf, with all his Hor&s;e, was drawn up upon the Hill, at
the Mouth of the Pa&s;&s;age, with the Infantry upon his right Hand, near
<HI>Langport,</HI> to &s;uccour tho&s;e two Regiments, in ca&s;e of Attack upon
the Pa&s;s, which the Gene|ral hoped to make good, at lea&s;t till Night, that
then we might retire with le&s;s Lo&s;s, being un&s;een. In the mean time,
General <HI>Goring</HI> commanded me to &s;end away all the Baggage and Cannon,
except two Field Pieces, which he commanded &s;hould be drawn to the Top of the
Hill, at the Head of the Pa&s;s, and bid me to order Sir <HI>Jo&s;eph
Wag&s;taffe</HI> from him, who commanded the Foot near to <HI>Langport,</HI>
that in ca&s;e the Enemy &s;hould force the Pa&s;s upon him, that then Sir
<HI>Jo&s;eph Wag&s;taffe</HI> &s;hould retire with all his Foot to
<HI>Langport,</HI> and there pa&s;s the River towards <HI>Bridgwater,</HI> and
burn down the Bridge behind him, which was a Draw-bridge over the River; and,
in the Morning, when I had Orders to &s;end away the Baggage and Cannon, I
&s;ent them that Way, for their greater Security, otherwi&s;e they had been all
lo&s;t; for we were in Hopes to keep that Pa&s;s till Night: Yet &s;o &s;oon as
the Enemy had put their Army in Order of Battle, upon the Top of the Hill, on
the other Side the Bogg, which we thought was their whole Army, they opened and
drew to their Right and Left, advancing <PB N="139" REF="160"> towards the
Pa&s;s, whil&s;t another great Body came up in their Place, by which their Army
was more than double our Number. However, our General neither lo&s;t his
Courage nor Con|duct, but &s;till remained at the Head of the Pa&s;s, with his
own Guards of Hor&s;e, comman|ded by Collonel <HI>Patrick Barnwell,</HI> a very
brave <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Gentleman, Son to the Lord <HI>Barnwell</HI>; next to
him was the General's own Regiment of Hor&s;e, commanded by Collonel
<HI>Charles Goring,</HI> his Excellency's Brother, who was al&s;o &s;econded by
Sir <HI>Arthur Slingsby,</HI> with his Regiment of Hor&s;e, and the re&s;t of
the Hor&s;e Army behind him; but the Enemy advancing very fa&s;t down the Hill,
with Hor&s;e, Foot, Dragoons and Cannon, much overpowered us in Number; and our
Foot that were drawn down to guard the Pa&s;s not doing their Duty, many of
them de&s;erting, and &s;hooting again&s;t us, the Enemy thereupon gained the
Pa&s;s. The General charged the Enemy twice, but being much overpowered in
Number, we were at la&s;t beaten off, and obliged to a very di&s;orderly
Re|treat. The Foot, commanded by Major Gene|ral <HI>Wag&s;taffe,</HI> retired
to <HI>Langport</HI>; as did like|wi&s;e the Lord <HI>Wentworth,</HI> and
retreated over the Bridge that Way to <HI>Bridgwater,</HI> having broken and
burnt down the Draw-bridge be|hind them: But our Hor&s;e were obliged to
re|treat the ordinary Way, which being a moori&s;h Ground, full of &s;everal
narrow Pa&s;&s;es, where &s;everal Officers were obliged to &s;tay, to make
good the Retreat for others; &s;o that divers of <PB N="140" REF="161">
Di&s;tinction were taken, too many to be reckoned up, and among the Pri&s;oners
was Sir <HI>Arthur Slingsby,</HI> but Lieutenant General <HI>Porter</HI>
e&s;ca|ped that Way, Room being made for him by other Officers. But our
General, with his Brother, Mr. <HI>Barnwell,</HI> Sir <HI>Bernard
Ga&s;coigne,</HI> and my &s;elf, with &s;ome of our Retinue, were obliged to
leave the Army upon our Left, to get over &s;everal difficult Places. However,
we came at la&s;t &s;afe to <HI>Bridgwater,</HI> tho' &s;omething about, and
were in great Fear, that all our Foot and Cannon were lo&s;t; but it &s;eems
Sir <HI>Jo&s;eph Wag&s;taffe</HI> marched all Night, and came &s;afe the next
Morning to <HI>Bridgwater,</HI> and we lo&s;t only one Piece of Cannon that
Way, be|cau&s;e the Carriage of it was broke. I &s;tayed all that Night with
the General in his Chamber, and when I gave him Notice in the Morning, that Sir
<HI>Jo&s;eph Wag&s;taffe</HI> was come with the Foot and the Cannon, he was
overjoyed.</P>
<P>After we had repo&s;ed two Days at <HI>Bridg|water,</HI> and got
together our &s;hattered Troops, who all pa&s;t thro' <HI>Bridgwater</HI> as
fa&s;t as they came, for their greater Security, we then mar|ched towards
<HI>Dun&s;tar</HI> Ca&s;tle, which we left on our Right, and made little or no
Stop till we came near <HI>Torrington,</HI> where our Army quarte|red, and the
General made his Head Quarters at Mr. <HI>Rolles</HI>'s Hou&s;e, where we
&s;tayed &s;ome Days, and then we marched towards <HI>Barn&s;ta|ple,</HI> and
from thence to <HI>Exeter,</HI> where we &s;tayed that Winter, with Four
Thou&s;and Hor&s;e, who quartered in the Country near us. Whil&s;t 
<PB N="141" REF="162"> we were about <HI>Torrington,</HI> the General &s;ent
the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI> to the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> at
<HI>Launce&s;ton,</HI> making great Complaints of his hard U&s;age, and made
&s;everal Demands from the General, to which no An&s;wer was given, becau&s;e
the Chancellor of the Exchequer was ab&s;ent, being gone farther into
<HI>Cornwal</HI> upon great Affairs of the Prince; and be&s;ides, the Prince
intended, at the Chancellor's Return, to go to <HI>Exeter</HI>; and when the
Prince came thither, General <HI>Goring</HI> was ill, and in a Cour&s;e of
Phy&s;ick: Whereupon the Chancellor was &s;ent to him, to whom, after many
A&s;&s;urances of continuing faithful to the King, and his Intere&s;t, he then
freely declared his Apprehen|&s;ion of his Brother <HI>Porter</HI>'s
Negligence, or Treachery, in many particular In&s;tances, and that he
re&s;olved to be quit of him. The Chan|cellor then told his Excellency freely,
that his Demands by the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI> to the Prince, were not
&s;ea&s;onable for his Royal Highne&s;s to grant, nor fit for him to a&s;k; and
&s;o the Chan|cellor left General <HI>Goring.</HI></P>
<P>But I mu&s;t not forget to tell, that whil&s;t General
<HI>Goring,</HI> Lord <HI>Wentworth,</HI> Lieutenant General <HI>Porter,</HI>
and mo&s;t of the General Offi|cers, both Hor&s;e and Foot, kept their Winter
Quarters in and about <HI>Exeter,</HI> the Death of Sir <HI>John Digby</HI>
made vacant the Employment of a Major General of Hor&s;e to the Lord
<HI>Goring</HI>'s Army, for which there were &s;everal Pretendants, among&s;t
which was Collonel <HI>Samuel Tuke,</HI> who being the elde&s;t Collonel of 
<PB N="142" REF="163"> Hor&s;e in our Army, &s;tood faire&s;t for it,
e&s;pe|cially being a Favourite to Lieutenant Gene|ral <HI>Porter,</HI> and to
Collonel <HI>Charles Goring,</HI> the General's Brother; and therefore made his
fir&s;t Addre&s;s to the Lieutenant General, de&s;iring his A&s;&s;i&s;tance in
his Pretentions; which being promi&s;ed him by the Lieutenant General, he then
applied him&s;elf to the Lord General <HI>Goring,</HI> who told him, he would
willingly have &s;erved him, but that he was before engaged for Collonel
<HI>Webb,</HI> by the Interce&s;&s;ion of Lieute|nant General <HI>Porter:</HI>
At which Collonel <HI>Tuke</HI> being much &s;urprized, he pre&s;ently demanded
the Lord General's Permi&s;&s;ion to quit his Com|mand, declaring, that being
the elde&s;t Collo|nel in the Army, he thought it a Right belon|ging to him,
and that he could not &s;erve with Honour, &s;ince another was put over his
Head. Hereupon the Lord General forthwith promi|&s;ed him his Di&s;charge, and
commanded his Se|cretary, <HI>Dun,</HI> to draw it. Upon this Infor|mation from
the General him&s;elf, that he was ingaged for Collonel <HI>Webb,</HI> upon the
Sollicita|tion of Lieutenant General <HI>Porter,</HI> Collonel <HI>Tuke</HI>
wrote a very reproachful Letter to the Lieutenant General, which &s;o &s;oon as
he re|ceived, he forthwith &s;ent his Brother-in-Law, Collonel <HI>Charles
Goring</HI> (for they were then both at Sir <HI>William Portman</HI>'s, five
Miles from <HI>Exeter</HI>) to de&s;ire Collonel <HI>Tuke</HI> to meet him at a
Place he then appointed, to interpret his Letter; and Collonel <HI>Goring</HI>
al&s;o told Collonel <HI>Tuke,</HI> that he mu&s;t bring a Friend with him, 
<PB N="143" REF="164"> who thereupon &s;ent to Collonel <HI>Adrian Scroop,</HI>
who promi&s;ed to go with him the next Mor|ning. But this Bu&s;ine&s;s was not
carried &s;o privately, but that it quickly came to the Lord General's
Knowledge, who pre&s;ently &s;ent for me, and commanded me to &s;et Guards
imme|diately upon Collonel <HI>Tuke,</HI> and upon Collo|nel <HI>Scroop,</HI>
and to require them, in his Excel|lency's Name, not to &s;tir from their
Lodgings till farther Orders. The Lord General was at this time indi&s;po&s;ed
with the Gout, and kept his Bed, but he pre&s;ently &s;ent for the Lord
<HI>Wentworth,</HI> and de&s;ired him to call a Council of War the next
Morning, of the principal Of|ficers that were then Town, and that his
Lord|&s;hip would be Pre&s;ident of it, for that there was a Quarrel, and a
Duel de&s;igned, betwixt Lieutenant General <HI>Porter</HI> and Collonel
<HI>Tuke:</HI> That this la&s;t was already &s;ecured in his Lod|ging, and
al&s;o Collonel <HI>Scroop,</HI> who was to be his Second; and that he had
&s;ent for the Lieute|nant General, and his Brother Collonel <HI>Goring,</HI>
who was concerned in the Quarrel. The next Morning the Council of War met,
where Lieu|tenant General <HI>Porter</HI> was pre&s;ent, and &s;at with the
Council, which was compo&s;ed of the Lord <HI>Wentworth,</HI> as Pre&s;ident,
Lieutenant General <HI>Porter,</HI> Major General <HI>Wag&s;taffe,</HI> Sir
<HI>William Courtney,</HI> Sir <HI>Foulk</HI> and Sir <HI>Henry Hunkes,</HI>
Sir <HI>Thomas Ba&s;&s;et,</HI> and my &s;elf. The fir&s;t thing (after having
read the Letter) upon Debate was, That the Letter was very reproachful and
provoking: The Sub&s;tance of the Letter was, <PB N="144" REF="165"> <HI>That
he</HI> (Collonel <HI>Tuke</HI>) <HI>would no more accu&s;e Lieutenant
General</HI> Porter <HI>of Cowardice, &s;ince he had fought, and killed a
Collonel in Ju&s;tifi|cation of his Honour; but that the Lieutenant General was
guilty of many other Sins, which ran in the &s;ame Rank with Cowardice; as, in
his Breach of Faith, having promi&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his Pretentions
to the General, when he had before ingaged the General to another: In his
little or no Religion, in turning the Bible and all &s;acred things into
Ridicule: In his great and con&s;tant Debaucheries, with many other Vices not
fit to be named; and that now being upon even Terms with him, he could do no
le&s;s than reproach him for his treacherous and unju&s;t Dealing, in this
Particular of his Pretentions, from the General's own Mouth; and that he
&s;hould look upon him as his darling Sin, whom he had loved the longe&s;t, and
had the mo&s;t Rea&s;on to repent him of it.</HI></P>
<P>After reading this Letter, which was much enlarged upon by the
Lieutenant General, who declared, that tho' the Letter was not a formal
Challenge, yet it was &s;o provoking and reproach|ful, that no Man of Honour
could receive it, without giving a Challenge to him that &s;ent it; and that
this was al&s;o from an inferior Officer to a &s;uperior, which was Death by
the Articles of War. Hereupon aro&s;e a long Debate, after which the Council
ordered, that I &s;hould go forthwith to the Lord General, to know from him,
whether he had di&s;charged Collonel <HI>Tuke</HI> from being an Officer in his
Army? To which <PB N="145" REF="166"> the General told me, <HI>That he had
di&s;charged him, and promi&s;ed him a formal Di&s;charge in Writing, and
commanded his Secretary to draw it up; and that if it was not done, it was the
Fault of his Secretary; and that &s;ince he had di&s;charged him by Word of
Mouth, he e&s;teemed him to be no longer an Officer.</HI> Upon my deli|vering
this An&s;wer from the General, the Coun|cil left off that Point, of debating
his being an Officer; but the Council thought fit a Wri|ting &s;hould be drawn
up, and pre&s;ented to him, which he &s;hould read publickly in Council, which
was done accordingly in the&s;e Words following. <HI>I confe&s;s to have
written a &s;canda|lous and injurious Letter to Lieutenant General</HI> Porter,
<HI>for which I am heartily &s;orry, and &s;o de&s;ire his Remi&s;&s;ion and
Friend&s;hip.</HI> This Wri|ting being agreed upon by the Council, Collo|nel
<HI>Tuke</HI> was called in to make this publick Acknowledgment; which Paper
being given to Collonel <HI>Tuke,</HI> he having fir&s;t read the Words
privately to him&s;elf, he expre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf in publick thus. <HI>I
confe&s;s to have written a Letter to Lieutenant General</HI> Porter; <HI>it
was my Sen&s;e of him when I wrote it, which is &s;till my Belief, and there is
not a Syllable in it which I will not ju&s;tify with my Life.</HI> Upon this
the Council commanded him to withdraw, and they began to be very &s;harp upon
him, that he &s;hould make that publick Declaration, contra|ry to the Sentiment
of the Council; and it was the Opinion of &s;ome, that he &s;hould be
com|mitted to Pri&s;on, till he &s;hould make that pub|lick 
<PB N="146" REF="167"> Acknowledgment which the Council had ordered: But Sir
<HI>Foulk</HI> and Sir <HI>Henry Hunkes,</HI> with Sir <HI>Thomas
Ba&s;&s;et,</HI> declared again&s;t it, and &s;aid, tho' he had &s;poken &s;o
publickly his Sen&s;e as to his own Letter, yet he had not refu&s;ed <HI>in
terminis</HI> to make the Acknowledgment; and that therefore, before they came
to that Extre|mity, of committing him to Pri&s;on, one of the Council &s;hould
be &s;ent to him, to per&s;wade him to make that publick Acknowledgment; and
accordingly I was de&s;ired to go to him, which I did, and told him the Sen&s;e
of the Council, and that it was their general Opinion, that he &s;hould not
&s;cruple of making that publick Ack|nowledgment, if he was called in again.
And upon my Return to the Council, and declaring that I found him willing to
make that Acknow|ledgment, he was called in again; and after his Re&s;pects
made to the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI> and the Council, he took the Paper in his
Hand, and &s;aid, <HI>In Obedience to the Order of your Lord&s;hip and this
Council, I do confe&s;s to have written a &s;candalous and injurious Letter to
Lieutenant General</HI> Porter, <HI>for which I am heartily &s;orry, and do
de&s;ire his Remi&s;&s;ion and Friend&s;hip</HI>; and then he retired. But then
the Lieutenant Ge|neral began to complain heavily, and &s;aid That was not a
&s;ufficient Satisfaction for the publick Scandal he had received, nor for the
in&s;olent Behaviour of Collonel <HI>Tuke,</HI> and he &s;eemed nothing
plea&s;ed or &s;atisfied with what the Coun|cil had done, who thereupon broke
up without farther Satisfaction.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="168">Some time after this, Lieutenant General
<HI>Porter</HI> came again to <HI>Exeter,</HI> before it was &s;ur|rendered,
and &s;ent again to Collonel <HI>Tuke</HI> for farther Satisfaction; but the
Collonel being then &s;ick in Bed, was not able to meet him as he de&s;ired:
However, Collonel <HI>Tuke</HI> did then write a Letter to him, a&s;&s;uring
him, that &s;o &s;oon as he was able to get on Hor&s;eback, he would not fail
to find him out, and give him the Satisfaction he de&s;ired, if the Fear of our
&s;udden Ruine did not make him go to the Par|liament &s;ooner, which fell out
as he foretold: For &s;oon after this, Lieutenant General <HI>Porter</HI> made
his Peace with General <HI>Fairfax,</HI> and went into the Parliament's
Quarters, and Col|lonel <HI>Tuke</HI> never heard more of him, nor from
him.</P>
<P>About this time the King &s;ent to General <HI>Goring,</HI> to
march to him with his Army; but the General neither obeyed the King's Orders,
nor communicated them to the Prince, or advi|&s;ed with the Prince about them,
tho' his Royal Highne&s;s then let him know, that he was well content he
&s;hould break thro' to the King with his Hor&s;e, thinking he might well and
ea&s;ily have done it: But the General (after Recovery of his Health) &s;pent
his Time in his u&s;ual Jol|lities, and was privately re&s;olved to leave the
Army, and go beyond Sea; and Lieutenant General <HI>Porter</HI> was al&s;o
re&s;olved to quit the Army, and retire to <HI>London</HI>; but both the&s;e
Tran&s;actions were carried very privately, and known to none but the Lord
<HI>Wentworth,</HI> who <PB N="148" REF="169"> went to the Prince with a Letter
from Gene|ral <HI>Goring,</HI> to beg Leave for his going into <HI>France,</HI>
for Recovery of his Health, as he pre|tended; yet intimating at the &s;ame time
to his Royal Highne&s;s, that he hoped to do him great Service by his going
thither. But I was after a&s;&s;ured by the Lord <HI>Wentworth,</HI> that he
never attended the Prince's Re&s;olution, but went forthwith to
<HI>Dartmouth,</HI> and there embarqued for <HI>France</HI>; but before his
going, &s;ign'd a War|rant for &s;ome Money for Lieutenant General
<HI>Porter,</HI> to bear his Charges to <HI>London,</HI> who &s;oon after the
Lord <HI>Goring</HI>'s Ab&s;ence, declined the Exerci&s;e of his Command, and
having re|ceived a Pa&s;s from Sir <HI>Thomas Fairfax,</HI> he went forthwith
to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Soon after the Lord <HI>Goring</HI>'s going for <HI>France,</HI>
the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI> declared, that General <HI>Goring</HI> intended to
return no more, but relied upon his Lord&s;hip to pre&s;erve the Hor&s;e, till
he could procure Licence from the Parliament to tran&s;port them for the
Service of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> or &s;ome other foreign Prince. But
after General <HI>Goring</HI> left the Army, the Sol|diers took a greater
Liberty than before, and much re&s;ented his going away. From the Be|ginning of
<HI>July</HI> till towards the End of <HI>Octo|ber,</HI> the General &s;tayed
at <HI>Exeter</HI>; and Four Thou&s;and Hor&s;e were quartered in that
Neigh|bourhood, without making any Attempt upon the Enemy: And con&s;idering
his doing nothing in all that time but plea&s;ing him&s;elf, many were of
Opinion, that if he had been confede|rate <PB N="149" REF="170"> with the
Enemy, and been corrupted to betray the We&s;t, he could not have done wor&s;e;
not having obeyed the King's Commands in going to him, tho' his Royal
Highne&s;s was willing to it. His Courage indeed was always e&s;teemed, but
lea&s;t of all his Con&s;cience and Integrity, and there was much Difference
be|twixt the Pre&s;entne&s;s of his Mind in a &s;udden Attempt, (tho' never
&s;o full of Danger) and of an Enterprize which required Deliberation and
Patience, for he could not keep his Mind long bent; of which I had a particular
Experience at his Siege of <HI>Taunton,</HI> where the Governour for the
Parliament made many frequent and dangerous Sallies, but were always
un&s;ucce&s;s|ful, by the Vivacity and Courage of General <HI>Goring</HI>'s
Spirit, which was very extraordinary.</P>
<P>After this General's going into <HI>France,</HI> his Army was
&s;olely left to the Di&s;po&s;ition of the Lord <HI>Wentworth,</HI> who was a
very lazy and un|active Man, and was not thought either of In|tere&s;t,
Experience, Courage, or Reputation enough, for that Tru&s;t which was devolved
upon him by General <HI>Goring:</HI> It was therefore re&s;olved by his Royal
Highne&s;s, that he &s;hould rather be advi&s;ed than commanded; and that if
his Lord&s;hip comported him&s;elf with that Tem|per and Mode&s;ty which was
expected from him, all Re&s;olutions &s;hould be formed in the Prince's
Council, and all Orders &s;hould i&s;&s;ue in his Lord&s;hip's Name, for the
Relief of <HI>Exeter</HI>; for all the Army of Hor&s;e was then drawn off from
<HI>Exeter,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI> <PB N="150" REF="171"> was
quartered at <HI>A&s;hburton,</HI> &s;ix Miles from <HI>Totnes,</HI> and the
whole Contribution which was for Support of the Army, was taken forcibly by the
Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI>'s Hor&s;e. Whereupon the Prince, being then at
<HI>Totnes,</HI> &s;ent for the Lord <HI>Wentworth,</HI> who told the Prince in
the fir&s;t Place, that he was to declare to his Roy|al Highne&s;s, that he
could receive no Orders from any Per&s;on but his Highne&s;s, the Lord
<HI>Goring</HI> having repo&s;ed that Tru&s;t in him, and talked very
imperiou&s;ly and di&s;re&s;pectfully. However, the Prince took little Notice
of it; but the next Day his Lord&s;hip being in Drink, which was his u&s;ual
Fault, he talked very offen&s;ively to the Chancellor (whom he always hated)
tho' of the Prince's Council, in Pre&s;ence of the Prince, who being much
di&s;&s;atisfied with the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI>'s Carriage, told him, he
would take the Command of the Army upon him&s;elf, and i&s;&s;ue out the Orders
as he &s;hould think fit; upon which the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI> troubled, and
much un&s;atisfied, returned to his Quarters at <HI>A&s;hburton,</HI> which
were &s;oon after beaten up by the Enemy at Noon Day, and the Army thereby put
into great Di&s;order.</P>
<P>Upon this Incident the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI> went in great
Ha&s;te to the Prince, who was then at <HI>Tave&s;tock,</HI> upon the Borders
of <HI>Cornwal,</HI> and in|formed the Particulars of his Lo&s;s, which was not
&s;o great as his Lord&s;hip imagined. The Prince was very de&s;irous to
pur&s;ue his former Re&s;olution of going to <HI>Totnes</HI> with the Body of
his Army; but the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI> told him, he believed 
<PB N="151" REF="172"> the Enemy was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of <HI>Totnes,</HI> and
that he could not &s;o &s;oon recover his Lo&s;s, nor get his Troops together
in any con&s;iderable Number, till they had &s;ome Days Re&s;t; and &s;o that
De|&s;ign of the Prince was ended; whereas the Rout of the Army was
occa&s;ioned only by &s;mall Parties of the Enemy, who came into our Quarters
in the Daytime, and found no Guards, and all their Hor&s;es in the Stables.
Here|upon his Royal Highne&s;s thought fit to go to <HI>Launce&s;ton,</HI> upon
the Borders of <HI>Cornwal,</HI> to be farther from the Enemy, and commanded
the Lord <HI>Wentworth,</HI> that all his Hor&s;e &s;hould be quartered on
<HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> Side, fearing otherwi&s;e, that all the Trained Bands of
<HI>Cornwal</HI> would run Home to &s;ave their Hou&s;es from being plun|dered,
to which the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI>'s Troops were much addicted, who
di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves for many Miles about the Country, as if no Enemy was
near them, and were all comman|ded by Lord <HI>Wentworth,</HI> who challenged
them by Deputation from the Lord General <HI>Goring</HI>; and the Lord
<HI>Wentworth</HI> would &s;ubmit to no other Command but that of the Prince.
The Mi&s;chief which grew hereupon was much more vi&s;ible than the Remedy,
when both Officers and Soldiers (by the Loo&s;ene&s;s and Extrava|gancy of the
Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI>'s Government) were glad to take any Occa&s;ion of
Excu&s;e for laying down their Arms: And whoever was fit would hardly undertake
the Command of a di&s;&s;olute, undi&s;ciplined, wicked, beaten Army, upon
which he mu&s;t engage his Honour. Howe|ver, <PB N="152" REF="173"> &s;ome
Re&s;olution was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in that Conjuncture to be taken by
the Prince, who thereupon declared the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> &s;hould take upon
him the Care of the whole Army, as being General, and the Lord
<HI>Wentworth</HI> &s;hould be General of the Hor&s;e, and Collonel
<HI>Webb</HI> Major General, and Sir <HI>Richard Greenvil</HI> General of the
Foot.</P>
<P>The Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> being entirely devoted to the King's
Intere&s;t, &s;ubmitted to the Plea&s;ure of the Prince, and told his Royal
Highne&s;s he would obey him, tho' he knew he mu&s;t lo&s;e his Honour: But
&s;ince his Royal Highne&s;s thought it nece&s;&s;ary to command him, he was
mo&s;t ready and willing to obey. There was no Su&s;picion of Sir <HI>Richard
Greenvil,</HI> becau&s;e he had been before under the Command of the Lord
<HI>Hopton</HI>; but it was believed the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI> (who had
carried him&s;elf more high and imperiou&s;ly &s;ince his di&s;orderly Retreat
from <HI>A&s;hburton,</HI> than before) would have refu|&s;ed; in which Ca&s;e
the Prince re&s;olved to com|mit the Lord <HI>Wentworth,</HI> and would have
given his Command to the Lord <HI>Capel:</HI> But much contrary to Expectation,
Sir <HI>Richard Greenvil</HI> refu&s;ed, who was thereupon forthwith &s;ent
Pri|&s;oner to the <HI>Mount</HI> in <HI>Cornwal,</HI> where he was, till the
Enemy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t Part of that County; and then, that he
might not fall in|to the Hands of the Enemy, the Prince permit|ted his being
tran&s;ported beyond Sea. And tho' the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI> &s;eemed much
&s;urpri|zed with the Prince's Order, which he heard 
<PB N="153" REF="174" MS="y"> read at the Council Table, de&s;ired time to
con|&s;ider of it till the next Day, that he might confer with his Officers;
yet the Prince told him &s;harply, that he would not refer his Acts to be
&s;canned by his Officers, but that his Lord|&s;hip &s;hould pre&s;ently give
his po&s;itive An&s;wer, whether he would &s;ubmit, or not? To which he
&s;ubmitted, and went that Night to his Quar|ters; at which neither the Prince,
nor his Council, nor others, were very glad, but rather wi&s;hed he would have
obliged the Prince to make other Alterations, as the Prince intended, becau&s;e
he knew the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI>'s Hu|mour, that he would never chearfully
obey.</P>
<P>The Prince then hearing of the Lo&s;s of <HI>Dart|mouth,</HI> and
every Day was News, and fearing the Lo&s;s of <HI>Exeter,</HI> it was thought
fit the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> &s;hould march back with his Army to|wards
<HI>Torrington,</HI> and that the Prince &s;hould not hazard his Per&s;on any
longer in that open Country, but &s;hould retire to <HI>Truro,</HI> near the
nether End of <HI>Cornwal,</HI> for his greater Security.</P>
<P><HI>Fairfax</HI> having taken <HI>Dartmouth</HI> by Storm, the
Governour &s;oon &s;urrendered the Ca&s;tle. He then came to <HI>Exeter,</HI>
which he &s;ummoned, but having received a &s;tout An&s;wer from Sir <HI>John
Berkeley</HI> the Governour, he left Sir <HI>Hardre&s;s Waller</HI> to fini&s;h
that Work, and went with his Army after the Lord <HI>Hopton,</HI> who had fixed
him&s;elf near <HI>Torrington,</HI> and had not been there above four or five
Days, where he had made &s;ome Barricadoes and little Fa&s;tne&s;&s;es, but he
heard that General <HI>Fairfax</HI> was come within <PB N="154" REF="175">
eight Miles of him. However, the Lord <HI>Hopton,</HI> for good Rea&s;ons,
thought it better to expect the Enemy there, than to retire into
<HI>Cornwal,</HI> with the few that remained of the Trained Bands, who would
immediately di&s;&s;olve, and run to their Hou&s;es, and all would &s;oon be
de|&s;troyed without Fighting; and therefore his Lord&s;hip cho&s;e rather
&s;taying where he was, notwith&s;tanding the great Di&s;advantage in Number,
thinking he might there defend him|&s;elf with greater Advantage, than in any
other Place. Very &s;harp Di&s;putes were on both Sides, and the Lord
<HI>Hopton</HI>'s Foot behaved them&s;elves with &s;uch Courage, that they
maintained the Fight all that Day till Night, retiring &s;till to|wards
<HI>Torrington</HI>; but at la&s;t, being over|powered by the Numbers of the
Enemy, who were &s;upplied from time to time with fre&s;h Troops, they forced
the Barricades, the Hor&s;e with his Lord&s;hip neither charging nor making a
Stand, but ba&s;ely ran away in great Con|fu&s;ion, leaving their General, the
Lord <HI>Hopton,</HI> who was hurt in the Face with a Pike, and his Hor&s;e
killed under him; but receiving a fre&s;h Hor&s;e, he was obliged to retire to
<HI>Strat|ton,</HI> where he &s;tayed &s;ome Days, till Twelve Hundred of his
Foot came up to him. Upon his Lord&s;hip's retiring, the Enemy entered
<HI>Torrington,</HI> and fell to Pillaging and Plun|dering the whole Town
extreamly, but were &s;oon &s;topt, by the Ammunition in the Church taking
Fire, by what Accident was unknown, but it brought a di&s;mal De&s;truction
both upon <PB N="155" REF="176"> the Soldiers and Burghers, there being near an
Hundred Barrels of Powder in the Church, which made a terrible <HI>Fracas</HI>
among&s;t all People; which being fini&s;hed, and General <HI>Fairfax</HI>
having a little &s;ettled <HI>Torrington,</HI> he marched after the Lord
<HI>Hopton</HI> to <HI>Strat|ton,</HI> whereupon his Lord&s;hip retired farther
to <HI>Bodmin,</HI> and tho&s;e Hor&s;e commanded by the Lord
<HI>Wentworth</HI> ob&s;erved no Orders. The Prince went from <HI>Truro</HI> to
<HI>Pendennis</HI> Ca&s;tle, and the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> and the Lord
<HI>Capel</HI> advertized his Royal Highne&s;s, that they had &s;everally
received Intelligence of a De&s;ign to &s;eize upon the Per&s;on of the Prince,
who there|upon returned no more to <HI>Truro,</HI> but &s;tayed at
<HI>Pendennis</HI> Ca&s;tle, and no Per&s;on knew the King's Plea&s;ure
concerning the Prince, but the Lord <HI>Culpepper</HI> and the Chancellor of
the Ex|chequer; and they two knowing only what was to be done, had no great
Confidence that they &s;hould have Reputation enough to go thro' with it,
finding the Earl of <HI>Berk&s;hire,</HI> who was then Governour to the Prince,
jealous of the De&s;ign of going into <HI>France,</HI> whatever they &s;aid to
the contrary, and the Governour of <HI>Pendennis</HI> Ca|&s;tle being old and
fearful, they dur&s;t not tru&s;t him with the Secret: Whereupon they &s;ent
Letters forthwith to the Lords <HI>Hopton</HI> and <HI>Capel,</HI> to know
their Opinion, who both agreed, that the Prince was immediately, without Lo&s;s
of Time, to be tran&s;ported to <HI>Scilly,</HI> which was a Part of
<HI>Cornwal</HI>; and News being daily brought, that our Army was &s;till
retiring, and <PB N="156" REF="177"> General <HI>Fairfax</HI> advancing after
it, Re&s;olution was therefore taken, that the Prince &s;hould that Night
embark for <HI>Scilly,</HI> a Ship being ready for him then in the Harbour; and
the Gover|nour and his Son (who was a worthy hone&s;t Gentleman) were called in
to the Prince's Chamber, and made acquainted with it; and that Night the Prince
went on Board, and ar|rived the next Night &s;afe in <HI>Scilly</HI>; from
whence the Lord <HI>Culpepper</HI> was immediately di&s;patched to
<HI>France,</HI> to acquaint the Queen with the Ar|rival of the Prince in that
I&s;land, and with the Wants and Incommodities of it, and that it was not &s;o
&s;trong as reported; and therefore his Royal Highne&s;s was &s;oon embarked
from thence for <HI>France,</HI> where they all &s;afely ar|rived.</P>
<P>When the Prince was gone, and the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> left
General in <HI>Cornwal,</HI> he &s;oon found the Soldiers, e&s;pecially the
Hor&s;e, could not be re&s;trained from Plundering, and thereupon his
Excellency called a Council of War, to con|&s;ider what was to be done. The
Lord <HI>Went|worth,</HI> with the principal Officers, declared, that the Men
would never be brought to fight, being taken in a wor&s;e Trap, than they took
<HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s Army near <HI>Foy,</HI> and the Hor&s;e Officers
propo&s;ed to &s;end for a Treaty, to which they all agreed, except Major
General <HI>Webb.</HI> The Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> told them, he could not
con&s;ent to a Treaty, without Leave from the Prince. But whil&s;t the Officers
continued their Impor|tunity, a Trumpeter arrived at the &s;ame time 
<PB N="157" REF="178"> from General <HI>Fairfax,</HI> with a Letter to the Lord
<HI>Hopton,</HI> offering a Treaty, which his Lord&s;hip kept private: However,
the General Officers all a&s;&s;embled, and declared, if the Lord
<HI>Hopton</HI> would not con&s;ent to a Treaty, they would treat them&s;elves;
and that in the <HI>Interim</HI> they would neither keep Guards, nor do their
Duty, the Enemy's Hor&s;e every Day mingling with them, without any Act of
Ho&s;ti|lity, and bought &s;everal of our Soldiers Hor|&s;es. Then the Lord
<HI>Hopton</HI> declared, that he would neither treat for him&s;elf, nor for
any of the Garri&s;ons, and gave the Hor&s;e Leave to treat. Whereupon &s;ome
Per&s;ons were pre&s;ently appointed, and Articles were &s;oon concluded, and
the Army of Hor&s;e was di&s;&s;olved; and every Hor&s;eman who had not &s;old
his Hor&s;e, had Twenty Shillings, with a Pa&s;&s;port from Gene|ral
<HI>Fairfax,</HI> to go home to their Hou&s;es, and there to live quietly,
without engaging farther in the Wars; and many of our Soldiers had &s;old and
exchanged &s;o many good Hor&s;es, for pitiful Jades they received from the
Enemy, that they would not give Twenty Shillings apiece for them; and &s;o many
Hundred of Sol|diers went Home on Hor&s;eback, with their Pa&s;&s;es from the
General, that the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> was obliged to treat with the Enemy,
tho' he would have no Article for him&s;elf, nor be men|tioned in the Treaty:
After which, his Lord|&s;hip, with the Lord <HI>Wentworth,</HI> Lord
<HI>Capel,</HI> and Major General <HI>Webb,</HI> went to the <HI>Mount</HI> in
<HI>Cornwal,</HI> from whence they were tran&s;por|ted <PB N="158" REF="179">
to <HI>Scilly,</HI> and from thence were embarqued for <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The King being now reduced to the lowe&s;t Condition that
po&s;&s;ibly could be, having lo&s;t all his Forces, mo&s;t of his Garri&s;ons
taken and yielded, and General <HI>Fairfax</HI> having cleared the We&s;t, was
marching to be&s;iege <HI>Oxford.</HI> The King being there, began to think of
&s;ome Way for his E&s;cape and Safety; and being treacherou&s;ly invited by
the <HI>Scots,</HI> to put him|&s;elf under the Protection of their Army then
at the Siege of <HI>Newark,</HI> his Maje&s;ty went di&s;|gui&s;ed from
<HI>Oxford,</HI> in <HI>April</HI> 1646, accompa|nied only with Mr. <HI>John
A&s;hburnham,</HI> a Groom of his Bed-chamber, and Mr. <HI>Hud&s;on</HI> a
Mini|&s;ter, few or none el&s;e being acquainted with his De&s;ign; but all
were amazed, when they heard he was arrived in the <HI>Scotch</HI> Camp, he
having been before-hand promi&s;ed Security for him&s;elf, and tho&s;e he
brought with him, or that &s;hould come to him, tho' they denied both in Word
and Act, as plainly appeared by their delivering him to the Parliament, a
Pri&s;oner, for Two Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds <HI>Sterling:</HI> And that the
<HI>Scots</HI> may be the better known, I &s;hall give you their Character by
one who was well acquainted with their wicked Princi|ples. He tells us,
<HI>They are a People who de|light to en&s;lave others, yet are of a
&s;lavi&s;h Con|dition them&s;elves; a People, who&s;e Freedom is Service,
who&s;e Mercies are Cruelties, who&s;e Religion is only Formality, who&s;e
Government is Tyranny, a Generation of Vipers and Hypo|crites,</HI> 
<PB N="159" REF="180"> <HI>whom no Oaths or Covenants can bind, no Courte&s;y
or Civility oblige.</HI> Thus the King was delivered Pri&s;oner to the
Parliament by the <HI>Scots,</HI> and by the Parliament &s;ent Pri&s;oner to
<HI>Holmby</HI>; and from thence he was &s;oon after forcibly taken away, and
carried to the Army, by Cornet <HI>Joyce</HI>; who being a&s;ked by the
Parliament Commi&s;&s;ioners, who then waited upon the King, by what Authority
he did it? He an&s;wered, it was by the Plea&s;ure of the Army, and that the
King &s;hould be with them with Honour, and in Safety. This Action &s;tartled
the Parliament extreamly, who from this time began to &s;urrender them&s;elves
and their Power into the Hands of their own Army. The General, in his Letter to
the Parliament, makes the King's Remove from <HI>Holmby</HI> to be by his own
Con&s;ent; tho' certainly it was not &s;o, tho' it might be without the
General's Knowledge: And the Lord <HI>Dumfermling</HI> ac|quainted the
Parliament, that the King com|manded him to tell them, that his Maje&s;ty was
unwillingly taken away, by a Party from the Army; and that he de&s;ired both
Hou&s;es to maintain the Laws of the Land, and that he might be obliged to
&s;ign many things in that Condition, and that he would not have them be
believed, till they had farther Notice from his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee the Incon&s;tancy of Men, and the Uncertainty of
worldly Affairs. The Offi|cers and Soldiers of an Army, tho' never &s;o
&s;ucce&s;sful and well di&s;ciplined, will, for want <PB N="160" REF="181"> of
Action, fall into Di&s;cord, and De&s;igns of Trouble: A victorious Army out of
Employ|ment, is very inclinable to a&s;&s;ume Power over their Leaders. When
the Parliament had Con|que&s;t and Succe&s;s after their own De&s;ires, yet
they were &s;trangely encumbered with the Mu|tinery of their Army on the one
Side, and with di&s;contented Petitions on the other, be&s;ides the Petulancy
of many Pamphlets, which daily flew abroad again&s;t their Proceedings. Many
believed there was &s;ome private Treaty at this time by &s;ome Officers of the
Army with the King, and that In&s;tructions were given for it by
<HI>Cromwell,</HI> that if the King would a&s;&s;ent to their Propo&s;als,
which were much lower than tho&s;e of the Parliament, the Army would then
&s;ettle the King upon his Throne. The King, in his own Judgment, &s;eemed
inclined to it, and therefore di&s;dained the Parliament's Propo&s;iti|ons, and
would rely upon the Propo&s;als of the Army, and urged a Treaty upon them. The
<HI>Scots</HI> complain of the King's being taken from <HI>Holmby</HI> by
Force, and would not apply to the Army, &s;ince it ought to be under the
Com|mand of the Parliament: They declared, that their Stability and Happine&s;s
did much depend upon the Safety and Pre&s;ervation of the King's Per&s;on, and
that they would endeavour to com|po&s;e the unhappy Differences; and therefore
de&s;ire the Propo&s;itions may be proceeded upon by the mutual Con&s;ent of
both Kingdoms, and de&s;ire there might be a pre&s;ent Treaty with the King,
and that he might come to <HI>London</HI> with <PB N="161" REF="182"> Safety,
Honour, and Freedom. The King being then pa&s;&s;ionately &s;en&s;ible of the
lan|gui&s;hing and un&s;ettled State of the Kingdom, and of their great
Di&s;tractions, pre&s;&s;ed earne&s;t|ly for a Peace, and was mo&s;t willing to
te&s;tify to all the World his Readine&s;s to contribute his utmo&s;t
Endeavours for it: But the Parliament then thought the King was too much in the
Army's Intere&s;t, who were then contriving their main De&s;ign, of coming up
to <HI>London,</HI> to curb both Parliament and City, and to make them act
according to their Pre&s;criptions.</P>
<P>About this time the Agitators were &s;et up, who were &s;ome
Soldiers elected out of each Re|giment of Hor&s;e and Foot, to meet and
con&s;ult by that Name, who undertook to under&s;tand and regulate the chief
Affairs of the Army. The&s;e Men were very bu&s;y, and the King was privately
informed, whether by De&s;ign of the Army, was not known, but &s;uppo&s;ed by
mo&s;t to be &s;o, that the Agitators intended &s;ome Vio|lence to the King's
&s;acred Per&s;on; and there|fore the King was privately per&s;waded to make an
E&s;cape, if po&s;&s;ible, and contrived by Sir <HI>John Berkeley,</HI>
Collonel <HI>Leg,</HI> and Mr. <HI>John A&s;hburnham,</HI> who provided a Ship
at <HI>Southamp|ton,</HI> and Hor&s;es were to be ready at <HI>Hampton</HI>
Ferry, on the other Side, for the King's E&s;cape: And that which gave mo&s;t
Su&s;picion that the Army de&s;igned the King's E&s;cape, was, that Collonel
<HI>Whaley</HI> (who had the Guard of the King's Per&s;on) did that very Day
give the King a Letter, which he &s;aid was put into his Hand 
<PB N="162" REF="183"> by an unknown Per&s;on, giving a blind Account of the
Agitators Intention to take away the King's Life for the Good of the Nation;
and that very Night <HI>Cromwell</HI> &s;ent a Letter to in|form the Parliament
that the King was e&s;caped, the Manner thus.</P>
<P>The Officers who attended the King, won|dering he came not forth
of his Chamber to Supper, having been long in, writing, they went into his
Chamber, and mi&s;&s;ed him, with|in half an Hour after he was gone; and his
Cloak was carele&s;sly ca&s;t upon the Ground, in his Way to the Water-&s;ide;
and this following Letter was left upon the Table, written with his own Hand,
to be communicated to the Parliament, in the&s;e Words following.</P>
<P><HI>That Liberty the King now generally preten|ded to, and aimed
at, was as nece&s;&s;ary for Kings as any other: That he had a long Time
endured Captivity, hoping it might tend to the Settlement of a good Peace; but
finding the contrary, and the Unfixedne&s;s of the Army, and new Guards &s;et
upon him, he had withdrawn him&s;elf: That wherever he &s;hould be, he would
earne&s;tly labour for &s;ettling a good Peace, and to prevent the Effu&s;ion
of more Blood; and if he might be heard with Freedom Honour, and Safety, he
would in&s;tantly break through his Cloud of Re|tirement, and &s;hew him&s;elf
ready to be</HI> Pater Patriae. Upon reading this Letter, and
<HI>Crom|well</HI>'s Information, it was ordered in Parlia|ment, That it
&s;hould be Lo&s;s of Life and E&s;tate for any one to conceal or detain the 
<PB N="163" REF="184"> King's Per&s;on, and not to di&s;cover it to both
Hou&s;es of Parliament.</P>
<P>Upon the King's E&s;cape the Parliament &s;ent all Ways to find
him; but in the dark, rainy, cloudy Night the King was lo&s;t in
<HI>Wind&s;or</HI> Fore&s;t, and pa&s;&s;ing in the Morning thro'
<HI>Farn|ham</HI> to the Sea-&s;ide, his Maje&s;ty mi&s;&s;ed his De&s;ign of
going to <HI>Jer&s;ey,</HI> the Ship failing to be at the Place, if any Place
was really ap|pointed which was promi&s;ed; and the Want of it cau&s;ed &s;ome
Reflections upon the Underta|ker, who was very well known to me. The King
fearing a Di&s;covery of him could by no Means be prevented, it was re&s;olved,
that the Kjng and Collonel <HI>Leg</HI> &s;hould lodge that Night at
<HI>Ted&s;worth,</HI> at the Hou&s;e of the Counte&s;s Dowager of
<HI>Southampton,</HI> which was near the Sea; and that the other two &s;hould
ferry over to the I&s;le of <HI>Wight,</HI> to find Collonel <HI>Ham|mond,</HI>
under whole A&s;&s;urance, for his Brother's &s;ake, Dr. <HI>Hammond,</HI> the
King hoped for &s;ome Friend&s;hip and Fidelity. This De&s;ign was ac|cordingly
put in Execution; and Sir <HI>John Berkeley</HI> and Mr. <HI>A&s;hburnham</HI>
were both told by the King, that unle&s;s Collonel <HI>Hammond</HI> gave his
Oath and Faith of Pre&s;ervation, Protection, Secrecy, and Freedom to the
King's Per&s;on at all Times, they &s;hould not di&s;cover any more, than
&s;ignify in general the King's E&s;cape from the imminent Danger of
A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination: That the King's De&s;ire led him to ca&s;t him&s;elf
upon Collonel <HI>Hammond</HI> for Protection, which if he &s;hould refu&s;e,
and &s;ecure the Per&s;ons of Sir <PB N="164" REF="185"> <HI>John Berkeley</HI>
and <HI>A&s;hburnham,</HI> the King and <HI>Leg</HI> (by their not returning at
the Time prefixed) might have Opportunity to di&s;po&s;e of them&s;elves
otherwi&s;e. The&s;e two being di&s;patch'd, the King &s;ent <HI>Leg</HI> to
the Counte&s;s, to tell her, that a Per&s;on of Quality, her dear Friend,
de&s;ired the Privacy of her Hou&s;e that Night, without Di&s;covery; to which
&s;he readily con&s;ented. On <HI>Sunday</HI> Mor|ning the two Me&s;&s;engers
got into the I&s;land, and met Collonel <HI>Hammond</HI> on his Way towards
<HI>Newport,</HI> whom they acquainted with the Bu|&s;ine&s;s. The Collonel
told them, he wi&s;hed the King's Safety as his own Soul, that he &s;hould not
be inqui&s;itive where the King was, but were he in his Cu&s;tody, his Oath and
Intere&s;t to the Parliament being in Ballance, he &s;hould be &s;afe from
Violence; but for the Freedom and Liberty of his Per&s;on, he could not
an|&s;wer it to his Superiours. This An&s;wer tho' not &s;atisfactory, nor
according to their Com|mi&s;&s;ion; yet they, being loath to be taken in|to
Cu&s;tody, or for what other Rea&s;on none can tell, came over with the
Collonel and a Guard to the Hou&s;e of the Counte&s;s; and
<HI>A&s;h|burnham</HI> went up Stairs to the King's Chamber, and told the King
Collonel <HI>Hammond</HI> was be|low at Supper, and had given A&s;&s;urance of
Ho|nour for his Maje&s;ty's Safety, but not of Li|berty for his Per&s;on; which
the King hearing, in Pa&s;&s;ion &s;truck his Hand upon his Brea&s;t, and
replied to <HI>A&s;hburnham; And is this all? Then I am betrayed!
A&s;hburnham</HI> and <HI>Berkeley,</HI> &s;orry for their great
Mi&s;advi&s;edne&s;s, would have made <PB N="165" REF="186"> &s;ome de&s;perate
Attempt to have killed <HI>Hammond,</HI> which the King would not admit of; and
in this Extremity, with a &s;eeming Willingne&s;s, the King went over with them
and with Collonel <HI>Hammond</HI> to <HI>Carisbrook</HI> Ca&s;tle. Collonel
<HI>Ham|mond</HI> immediately acquaints the Parliament with the King's being
there, who forthwith vote the King &s;hould &s;tay there; that none who had
bore Arms again&s;t the Parliament &s;hould &s;tay in the I&s;land, excepting
&s;uch Inhabitants as had compounded; that no Delinquent or Foreigner &s;hould
be admitted to the King's Pre|&s;ence without Leave of Parliament; that tho&s;e
Per&s;ons who attended the King thither &s;hould be &s;ent to the Parliament,
which Collonel <HI>Ham|mond</HI> refu&s;ed; and al&s;o complained, that the
Conditions for the King were not &s;uitable to his Quality. Thus that unhappy
King fell out of one Trap into another; and &s;ends his Me&s;&s;age to the
Parliament, why he did not receive their Propo&s;itions for Peace, which they
&s;ent him to <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> becau&s;e the Commi&s;&s;ioners from
<HI>Scotland</HI> pre&s;ented him the &s;ame Day with a Declaration again&s;t
tho&s;e Propo&s;itions, in the Name of the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>Here we may take notice of the perplexed Condition of the
Parliament; the Army rai&s;ed, commi&s;&s;ioned, and paid by them, making War
again&s;t them, and with their Swords in Hand controul their Ma&s;ters, and had
a De&s;ign to carry away the King from the I&s;le of <HI>Wight,</HI> but were
prevented by the General; the City, the Parliament's old Friends and
A&s;&s;i&s;tants, <PB N="166" REF="187"> are aver&s;e towards them, and
que&s;tion their Integrity, reproach them, and would ca&s;t them off; the King
writes to the Parliament, and taxes them for not an&s;wering his la&s;t
Me&s;&s;age, and earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;es for a pre&s;ent Treaty, that Peace
might be &s;ettled, and lays the Retarding it upon them: The <HI>Scotch</HI>
Commi&s;&s;ioners declare a joint Intere&s;t with the Parliament, for
&s;ettling a Peace in both Kingdoms, prote&s;t again&s;t the four Bills &s;ent
to the King, pre&s;s for a pre&s;ent Treaty at <HI>London,</HI> &s;aying,
<HI>Let that be given to</HI> God <HI>which is</HI> God<HI>'s, and that to</HI>
Cae&s;ar <HI>which is</HI> Cae&s;ar<HI>'s,</HI> and put them in Mind of their
profe&s;&s;ed Loyalty. Collonel <HI>Hammond</HI> has more &s;trict Orders to
&s;ecure the King, and &s;e|veral of the King's Servants which attended him are
di&s;charged: Then the Parliament &s;end Commi&s;&s;ioners to the King, who
return with|out Satisfaction; and after a long Debate, the prevailing Party in
the Hou&s;e of Commons vote no more Addre&s;&s;es to the King, and no
Me&s;&s;age or Letters to be received from him; and that it &s;hould be High
Trea&s;on for any to deliver any Me&s;&s;age to the King, or receive any from
him, without the Leave of both Hou&s;es of Parlia|ment; and Collonel
<HI>Hammond,</HI> with Sir <HI>Wil|liam Con&s;table,</HI> had Orders to place
and di&s;place &s;uch Per&s;ons about the King as they thought fit, which
highly di&s;contented the King; but the Governour &s;aid, he had Orders from
the Par|liament for it, whom he mu&s;t obey.</P>
<P>Soon after this the General pre&s;ents an Ad|dre&s;s to the
Parliament, in the Name of the <PB N="167" REF="188"> whole Army, that they
would &s;tand by the Parliament, in making no more Addre&s;&s;es to the King;
and that they would intirely &s;ubmit to the Government of the Parliament. Thus
they are quickly made Friends again; and the Army had the Thanks of the
Hou&s;es for their Addre&s;s; who ordered the King's Hou&s;hold &s;hould be
di&s;&s;olved, and the Navy no longer be called the King's Navy: Whereupon the
<HI>Hollanders</HI> (as they had Rea&s;on) refu&s;ed to &s;trike Sail, as being
the elder State. Two Earls were named to go to <HI>Scotland,</HI> to acquaint
that Kingdom with what the Parliament had done, and a Declaration was
publi&s;hed for no more Addre&s;&s;es to the King, wherein all the
Mi&s;car|riages of the Government were named, from the King's fir&s;t coming to
the Crown.</P>
<P>Thus the Parliament and Army were made Friends, and well fixed
again, by the Cunning of of <HI>Cromwell</HI> and his Party; but then the
Appren|tices, with others in <HI>London,</HI> made an In&s;urrection again&s;t
the Parliament and Army, and great Pre|parations were making in
<HI>Scotland</HI> for a War, declaring they would re&s;cue the King from
Im|pri&s;onment, which was done contrary to the Re|&s;olution of both Kingdoms;
and that the King might come to one of his own Hou&s;es near <HI>London,</HI>
with Honour, Freedom, and Safety: And Infor|mation came from <HI>Scotland,</HI>
that the King's Party there was very &s;trong, and carried all, and that there
would be a general Ri&s;ing in that Kingdom, for Religion, King, and Church;
and the Chan|cellor of <HI>Scotland,</HI> by Order of their Parlia|ment, 
<PB N="168" REF="189"> demanded, that the King might come to &s;ome of his
Courts near <HI>London,</HI> with Free|dom, Honour, and Safety, and that a
per&s;onal Treaty be had with his Maje&s;ty, and that the Independant
Schi&s;matick Army might be di&s;|banded, which governed all as they plea&s;ed.
Whereupon the Parliament returned An&s;wer, That they would keep the Covenant
and the Treaty between the two Kingdoms, and that they would be ready to join
with <HI>Scotland</HI> in the Propo&s;itions pre&s;ented to the King at
<HI>New|market.</HI></P>
<P>About this time, or a little before, the Duke of <HI>York</HI>
made his E&s;cape into <HI>Holland,</HI> and was very tenderly and kindly
received by the Prince and Prince&s;s of <HI>Orange,</HI> at who&s;e E&s;cape
the Parliament was very much troubled; and now Petitions came from &s;everal
Parts of <HI>England,</HI> and Ri&s;ings were in &s;everal Counties, and the
People in general were weary of the War, and would have a per&s;onal Treaty
with the King: And Ri&s;ings were not only at Land, but In|formation came, that
&s;everal Ships were revol|ted from <HI>Rain&s;borough,</HI> whom they had
&s;et on Shore, and &s;ent for the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> to command them,
who was thereupon declared Admiral. Thus a new War was begun, and great
Divi&s;ions and Perplexities were in Parlia|ment; and yet the Ri&s;ings in
&s;everal Parts for the King not being well concerted, were &s;till qua&s;hed,
and did only &s;erve to unite the Party &s;tronger again&s;t the King. However,
the Par|liament &s;eeing that the People's Hearts were <PB N="169" REF="190">
generally &s;et again&s;t them, and that the revol|ted Ships at <HI>Deal</HI>
would not own them, finding their Backwardne&s;s for a per&s;onal Treaty with
the King, and that the City of <HI>London</HI> and Offi|cers of the Trained
Bands, prayed the King might be brought to <HI>London,</HI> with Freedom,
Honour, and Safety, to treat with the Parlia|ment, and that the City would
engage for the Security of his Maje&s;ty's Royal Per&s;on, and would al&s;o
undertake to keep the Parliament &s;afe from all Tumults and Mutinery, and that
they would defend the King and Parliament in the Treaty, and defray the Charge
of the Guards during the Treaty, and find a conveni|ent Place for the Treaty;
with many other Particulars: The Parliament hereupon began to think of a
Treaty, and to &s;et a&s;ide their Votes of Non-Addre&s;&s;es. In the mean
time, the&s;e &s;everal Petitions for Peace encouraged the Duke of
<HI>Buckingham,</HI> with his Brother, with the Earls of <HI>Holland</HI> and
<HI>Peterborough,</HI> to a Ri&s;ing about <HI>King&s;ton,</HI> where they were
&s;oon pur&s;ued, and the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> (who had formerly had a
great Hand in bringing Straits upon the King and Kingdom, in the Beginning of
the War) now &s;eeing the Parliament backward to a per&s;onal Treaty, hoped
they &s;hould be able in the End to bring the Parliament to Rea&s;on: But the
Parliament's Army being old Soldiers, pro&s;pe|rous in their Attempts, and well
provided with all Nece&s;&s;aries, it was a de&s;perate Attempt to make Head
again&s;t them, without having be|fore concerted all things well; which was a 
<PB N="170" REF="191"> great Prejudice to the King's Affairs, there being
&s;mall Tru&s;t to be given to People's Promi&s;es in &s;uch Occa&s;ions, who
would not &s;tir, unle&s;s they &s;aw the Tide turning with &s;ome previous
Succe&s;s, which was at that time very unhappy to the King's Affairs in all
Parts; tho' nothing could be more honourable, ju&s;t, and pious, than to
endeavour re&s;cuing our Country from the Mi&s;ery and Slavery it lay under;
and our Sins were certainly the Cau&s;e it took Effect, joined with the
Mi&s;management of tho&s;e who undertook it, without having fir&s;t well
concerted for the carrying on that De&s;ign: So that the Earl of
<HI>Holland</HI>'s Party was totally defeated, him&s;elf with many others taken
Pri|&s;oners, and the Brother to the Duke of <HI>Buck|ingham,</HI> and others
killed. Then Duke <HI>Hamil|ton</HI> enters <HI>England</HI> with an Army, and
all join|ing with him are declared Rebels. Here is a &s;trange Turn of Affairs,
to which all human Actions are &s;ubject. Great Endeavours were formerly
u&s;ed, to bring in the <HI>Scots</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Parliament, and now
they invade <HI>England</HI> with a con&s;iderable Army; they joined before
with the Parliament again&s;t the King, and now they took with the King
again&s;t the Parliament. The People of this World are like the Sea, &s;till
eb|bing and flowing, always in an uncertain Mo|tion, con&s;tant in nothing but
Incon&s;tancy.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> and Duke of <HI>York</HI> did at this
time come to <HI>Yarmouth</HI> Road with divers Ships, and landed &s;ome Men,
but were beaten by the Parliament's Hor&s;e, and &s;everal taken 
<PB N="171" REF="192"> Pri&s;oners; but the Town re&s;cued them, and the re&s;t
of his Royal Highne&s;s's Men got into the Town. The Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI>
of <HI>Parham</HI> was on Ship-board, and commanded the Prince's Fleet, having
quitted the Parliament, upon their declining a per&s;onal Treaty; and when the
Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> came near him with the Parliament Fleet, the Lord
<HI>Willoughby</HI> was ve|ry earne&s;t to have fought, upon A&s;&s;urance that
&s;everal in the Fleet would have revolted to his Royal Highne&s;s; but tho&s;e
that were about the Prince di&s;&s;waded him from Fighting, preten|ding great
Danger to his Highne&s;s's Per&s;on, and &s;o they carried it: Whereas, in all
Probability, (as the Seamens Affections then &s;tood) the Par|liament's Fleet
would have been endangered. The Prince then &s;topped &s;everal Merchants
Ships, and &s;ent to the Merchants Adventurers at <HI>London,</HI> for Twenty
Thou&s;and Pounds <HI>Ster|ling,</HI> to relea&s;e their Ships; and that he was
come with that Fleet, to endeavour to relea&s;e his Maje&s;ty from his
Impri&s;onment.</P>
<P>The Parliament &s;eeing the General Inclina|tion of the People was
for a Treaty, they fell from their Vote of Non-Addre&s;&s;es, and ordered a
per&s;onal Treaty with the King in the I&s;le of <HI>Wight,</HI> with Honour,
Freedom, and Safety, in what Place there his Maje&s;ty &s;hould appoint, who
well approved of <HI>Newport,</HI> and received the Parliament
Commi&s;&s;ioners with much Chear|fulne&s;s, declaring, that no Man de&s;ired a
Peace &s;o much as he; and that he would hearken to any Motion that might
conduce to &s;o good an <PB N="172" REF="193"> End, and that whoever gained by
the Troubles, he was &s;ure to be a Lo&s;er; and challenged all Men to produce
the lea&s;t Colour of Rea&s;on, that he was again&s;t the Treaty. He then
&s;aid, if it was Peace they de&s;ired, he had &s;hewed them the Way, by a
ju&s;t Compliance with all their Intere&s;ts. If they de&s;ired Plenty and
Happi|ne&s;s, they were the in&s;eparable Effects of Peace. If it was Security,
he offered the Militia for all his Time. If it was a Liberty of Con&s;ci|ence,
he that wanted it mo&s;t, was mo&s;t willing to give it. If it was the right
Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice, all Officers and Offices of Tru&s;t he left to
the Choice of the Parliament. If they would have frequent Parliaments, he fully
con|curred therewith. If they demanded the Ar|rears of the Army which fought
again&s;t him, he fully agreed they &s;hould be paid: So that all the World
might &s;ee his unwearied Endea|vours for Peace.</P>
<P>The Lords and Commons agreed, that the Vote again&s;t farther
Addre&s;&s;es &s;hould be recalled: That the King had cho&s;en <HI>Newport</HI>
in the I&s;le of <HI>Wight,</HI> to treat with the Parliament's
Commi&s;|&s;ioners, and all &s;uch Per&s;ons &s;hould be admit|ted, as his
Maje&s;ty &s;hould think fit to &s;end for: That Collonel <HI>Hammond</HI>'s
In&s;tructions for keep|ing the King &s;hould be repealed, taking the King's
own Engagement for his going abroad in the I&s;land, and Hor&s;es, Coaches, and
Mo|ney, both for the publick, and the King's pri|vate U&s;e, were &s;ent to the
I&s;le of <HI>Wight,</HI> where the King kept a Fa&s;t for a Ble&s;&s;ing upon
the <PB N="173" REF="194"> Treaty, and agreed in every thing, except Re|ligion,
wherein he let the Commi&s;&s;ioners know how far he could conde&s;cend. Some
of the Commi&s;&s;ioners then begged of the King upon their Knees, with Tears
in their Eyes, as to the Propo&s;ition touching Religion, but Matter of
Con&s;cience prevailed more with the King than all their Arguments; of which
they gave an Account to the Parliament, who thereupon vo|ted, that the King's
Conce&s;&s;ions as to Religion, the Church, and <HI>Ireland,</HI> were
un&s;atisfactory. However, the Hou&s;e of Commons voted, that a Committee
&s;hould draw up &s;omething for the King's coming to <HI>London,</HI> with
In&s;tructions for the Terms of his Maje&s;ty's being in Freedom, Honour, and
Safety: That the Committee &s;hould al&s;o con&s;ider of the King's De&s;ires
concerning his Revenues: That an Act of Obli|vion &s;hould be pre&s;ented to
the King, to be pa&s;&s;ed with &s;uch Limitations as &s;hall be agreed by both
Hou&s;es. The Hou&s;e of Commons vote likewi&s;e, that the King &s;hould come
to <HI>London,</HI> &s;o &s;oon as the Conce&s;&s;ions in the Treaty were
agreed, and that the King &s;hould have his Lands and Revenues made good to
him, according to the Laws; and that what he &s;hould pa&s;s away of his legal
Right, he &s;hould have Allowance in Compen&s;ation: And that an Act of
Oblivion &s;hould be agreed upon. And both Hou&s;es agreed to all the&s;e
Votes, and, in fine, the Par|liament voted, that the King's Conce&s;&s;ions to
the Propo&s;itions of the Parliament upon the Treaty, were &s;ufficient Grounds
for &s;ettling the <PB N="174" REF="195"> Peace of the Kingdom, and they named
a Com|mittee to go to the General and Head Quarters, to confer with the General
and Officers of the Army, for the Continuance of a good Corre|&s;pondence
betwixt the Parliament and Army.</P>
<P>But whil&s;t the&s;e things were doing, Collonel <HI>Hammond</HI>
&s;ends a Letter to the Parliament, with one inclo&s;ed from the General unto
him, requiring him to repair to his Excellency at the Head Quarters, and that
Collonel <HI>Ewre</HI> was appointed to take Charge of the King in the I&s;le
of <HI>Wight.</HI> Hereupon the Commons voted, That Collonel <HI>Hammond</HI>
&s;hould &s;tay in the I&s;le of <HI>Wight,</HI> and continue his Charge, and
that the Admiral &s;hould forthwith &s;end Ships for Security of the I&s;le of
<HI>Wight,</HI> and that they &s;hould obey Collonel <HI>Hammond:</HI> But a
Me&s;&s;en|ger brought Word, that Collonel <HI>Hammond</HI> was upon his Way to
<HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> according to the Ge|neral's Order, and that Collonel
<HI>Ewre</HI> had &s;e|cured his Maje&s;ty's Per&s;on, and removed him to
<HI>Hur&s;t</HI> Ca&s;tle, a pitiful Place, and mo&s;t pe&s;ti|lential Air.
Hereupon the Parliament &s;ent a Letter to the General, acquainting him, that
tho&s;e Orders and In&s;tructions from him to Col|lonel <HI>Ewre,</HI> for
&s;ecuring the King's Per&s;on, were contrary to their Re&s;olution, and
fre&s;h In&s;tructions were &s;ent again by the Parliament to Collonel
<HI>Hammond,</HI> to return, and attend his Charge in the I&s;le of
<HI>Wight</HI>; and that it was the Plea&s;ure of the Parliament, that his
Excellency &s;hould recal his Orders, and that Collonel <HI>Hammond</HI>
&s;hould again attend his <PB N="175" REF="196"> Charge; but Collonel
<HI>Hammond</HI> &s;ent Word to the Parliament, that he was detained at
<HI>Wind|&s;or,</HI> and that Collonel <HI>Ewre</HI> had the Charge of the
King. At the &s;ame time the General wrote to the Lord Mayor of
<HI>London,</HI> that he was up|on his March with his Army towards
<HI>London,</HI> and demanded Fourty Thou&s;and Pounds <HI>Ster|ling</HI>
immediately of the City, and that he would quarter his Army in the void
Hou&s;es near the City, as <HI>Whitehall, St. James,</HI> the <HI>Mews, York
Hou&s;e,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Upon this Advance of the Army, all Per&s;ons were full of
Perplexity, not knowing the End of it. The Parliament then declared the
&s;ei|zing of the King's Royal Per&s;on was without their Advice, and again&s;t
their Con&s;ent; and the Hou&s;e being to &s;it the next Day, Collonel
<HI>Pride,</HI> with &s;everal of his Regiments, &s;tood in the Court of
Reque&s;ts, upon the Stairs in the Lobby before the Hou&s;e of Commons,
<HI>Pride</HI> having a Paper of Names in his Hand, and the Lord <HI>Gray</HI>
of <HI>Grooby</HI> &s;tood by him, to inform him who the Members were; and
<HI>Pride</HI> &s;eized upon &s;uch as the Lord directed by his Note, and
&s;ent them away with Soldiers, by &s;pecial Order from the General and Council
of Offi|cers. The Hou&s;e of Commons being informed of this, &s;ent their
Serjeant at Arms to the Mem|bers &s;eized upon, to let them know, it was the
Plea&s;ure of the Hou&s;e, that they &s;hould forth|with attend the Service of
the Hou&s;e, but they were &s;till detained by the Guard of Officers.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="197">The Army having thus ejected the greate&s;t
and be&s;t Part of the Hou&s;e of Commons, brought the re&s;t &s;o to their
Will, whom they permitted to &s;it, that they acted nothing but by their
Di|ctates, and in pur&s;uance of their De&s;igns, which were to &s;ubvert
Monarchy, and to bury it in one Grave with the King; and having contri|ved with
this Juncto of the Hou&s;e of Commons, how to bring the King to his End, which
they &s;oon re&s;olved upon, with a &s;trange unheard of Impudence, in a
pretended Way of Ju&s;tice, (who&s;e Death the Juncto had long before
re|&s;olved upon) and their De&s;ign being now ripe, a Re&s;olution was taken,
which amazed the whole Chri&s;tian World, of which pa&s;t Ages had ne|ver any
Precedent, nor may any future Age take Example by this mo&s;t barbarous and
hor|rid Cruelty, to bring a ju&s;t King, their lawful Sovereign (who prized his
Subjects Liberties and Welfare before his own Life) to be ad|judged by his
mo&s;t rebellious Subjects, and condemned to die, by a pretended Legality and
Cloak of Ju&s;tice, with mock Formalities of Law, and Villainy of &s;o deep a
Dye, that all the World blu&s;h at, being the Ma&s;terpiece of all Iniquities,
which they thought better than to have poi&s;oned their King in
<HI>Carisbrook</HI> Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>And when the nau&s;eous pe&s;tilential Air of <HI>Hur&s;t</HI>
Ca&s;tle effected not what they de&s;igned, then they carried him with a
&s;trong Guard to <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> in order to his intended Tryal, deny|ing
him not only the Ceremony of the Knee, but even the common Civility of the
Hat.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="198">The King being brought from
<HI>Wind&s;or</HI> to <HI>St. James,</HI> their Juncto of Parliament proceed to
Votes in order to his Tryal, and declare, That by the fundamental Laws of the
Land, it was Trea&s;on in the King of <HI>England,</HI> to le|vy War again&s;t
his Parliament and Kingdom, and all the Blood &s;pilt was by the Juncto laid
upon the King, who was the greate&s;t Sufferer in the War, which was made and
begun upon him; and what the King did, was purely in his own Defence, who
endeavoured to &s;top that Flux of Blood, by a Treaty with his two Hou|&s;es of
Parliament, which was agreed upon, but hindered by the imperious Army, who were
&s;o audacious, as to &s;tyle the King, in their unpa|rallelled rebellious
Remon&s;trance, the King|dom's capital Enemy, who was formerly con|demned for
yielding too little to his Parliament, and was now to be condemned by the Army,
for yielding too much: He was formerly im|pri&s;oned for making War, and now
was to be condemned for making Peace: He was at fir&s;t condemned for having
evil Coun&s;ellours, and was now to be condemned, having no Coun&s;el; and all
this to be done by Wolves in Sheeps Clothing, who pretended only Zeal, when
their Hearts were filled with Blood, and were re&s;olved from Servants to
become Ma&s;ters, to bring in Democracy, by aboli&s;hing Monarchy, declaring in
their Charge, by that impudent Arch-Traitor <HI>Brad&s;haw,</HI> That the King
of <HI>Eng|land</HI> is entru&s;ted by the People with a limited Power to
govern according to the Laws of the <PB N="178" REF="199"> Land, and not
otherwi&s;e; and that by his Tru&s;t, Oath, and Office, he is obliged to u&s;e
the Pow|er committed to him, for the Good and Bene|fit of the People, and for
Pre&s;ervation of their Rights and Liberties; and where the King fails in any
of the&s;e, and rules and governs according to his Will, he thereby commits
Trea&s;on, and may be impeached as a Traitor and Murderer: A Doctrine never
heard of before, even among&s;t the mo&s;t barbarous Nations, it evidently
ap|pearing, that the Authority of Kings is imme|diately derived from God, and
not conferred upon them as a Tru&s;t from the People. They are called the
<HI>Mini&s;ters of God, and the Powers that be are ordained of God.</HI></P>
<P>When God fir&s;t &s;ubjected his own People to the Government of
Kings, the People had no|thing to do in conferring the Power. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>
was made King and Ruler by God him&s;elf; &s;o <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> and the
<HI>Judges</HI>; for &s;o long Theocracy did continue vi&s;ible among&s;t Men:
And when the People de&s;ired a King, God was not angry with them for
de&s;iring it, for he had before told them, that they &s;hould have a King, but
for &s;ome Irregularities in the Manner of their de|&s;iring it; neither was
the King cho&s;en by the People, but by Lot, and no Hand of the Peo|ple in
chu&s;ing him. <HI>David</HI> was made King by God's immediate Choice; but
after him the Government de&s;cended by Succe&s;&s;ion: And no Hi&s;tory either
&s;acred or profane, can &s;hew any Foot&s;teps, that the People did entru&s;t
their Power to their Kings; which Suppo&s;ition is <PB N="179" REF="200"> built
upon the mere Strength of their own Ima|gination. And if we take a View of all
the Ways whereby Princes a&s;cend to the Throne, it will appear they are but
few; and yet in none of them the People confer the Power on the King.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, by De&s;cent and Succe&s;&s;ion, as in <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
the People do not confer the Power. I know very well, at the King's Coronation,
the Con&s;ent of the People is demanded; yet the King is King to all Intents
and Purpo&s;es before his Coronation. Be&s;ides, all the People are not
&s;ummoned, nor any con&s;iderable Part of them appear at the Coronation: And
if any &s;hould reject his Prince, that would not hinder the Coronation, which
is barely a thing of Cour&s;e, and does not deduce the King's Power from the
People. Nay, &s;ome Kings have de|ferred their Coronation, being only a
Ceremo|ny. In the next Place, if a King gets the Crown by Conque&s;t, no Man
can &s;ay, he re|ceives the Crown by Con&s;ent of the People, tho' there be a
tacit Con&s;ent in their yielding him Obedience. As for tho&s;e who &s;urprize
a King|dom by Fraud, they may impo&s;e upon the Peo|ple, &s;o as to gain a
formal Con&s;ent, yet there is not a real Con&s;ent in tho&s;e that are thus
cajoled by the People, who had a Hand in bringing them in.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome that come to the Crown by Election, and here the
People think the King derives his Power from them, believing the Throne was
vacant, and make Stipulations with him that is to govern: But we mu&s;t
con&s;ider, <PB N="180" REF="201"> that there is much Difference betwixt
de&s;igning the Per&s;on, and conferring the Power; the for|mer is from them
that chu&s;e, the latter by no means. The Dean and Chapter of a Cathedral, by
the King's Leave, chu&s;e a Bi&s;hop, <HI>Sede va|cante</HI>; this Choice
de&s;igns the Per&s;on, but does not confer the Power, which is afterwards
gi|ven him in his Con&s;ecration. The Aldermen and Commons of a City do yearly
chu&s;e their Mayors; this Choice &s;hews the Per&s;on, but does not confer the
Power, which he hath by the King's Charter. When the Electors chu&s;e an
Emperor, or the States of <HI>Poland</HI> chu&s;e their King, they only
de&s;ign his Per&s;on, his Power is not from them, but immediately from God.
But &s;uppo&s;ing that, in the fir&s;t In&s;titution of Monarchy, the People
did confer the Power upon the Prince, it doth not therefore follow, that it
lyes in the Power of the People to re|voke it; tho' this was unlawfully
maintained again&s;t King <HI>Charles</HI> I. and &s;ince by &s;ome People
holding the &s;ame Principles, who would have the King's Power to be a Tru&s;t
committed to him by the People, and &s;o revocable; which is a very fal&s;e
Suppo&s;ition, and the Super&s;tructure upon it mu&s;t needs fall in Cour&s;e;
and yet &s;uppo&s;ing it was true, the Revocablene&s;s does not follow.</P>
<P>Both Law and Rea&s;on tell us, that what is ab&s;olutely conferred
in any Compact, is not to be revoked. When the Aldermen and Common Council have
cho&s;en a Lord Mayor, it does not lye in their Power to rea&s;&s;ume the
Tru&s;t into their own Hands: When the Knights of the <PB N="181" REF="202">
Shire are cho&s;en to &s;it in Parliament, it does not lye in the Freeholders
Power afterwards to re|cal their Tru&s;t: They might have forbore to commit the
Tru&s;t, but they cannot recal it. Then the Accountablene&s;s of Princes to
their People, in their Repre&s;entatives, hath pa&s;&s;ed for current Doctrine
in the la&s;t Age, by Impri|&s;oning, Trying, and Condemning their lawful King;
whereas no earthly Power can ju&s;tly call their King in Que&s;tion, God
Almighty be|ing the only Ruler of Princes, and to him alone they owe their
Accounts, by whom all Kings reign, and cannot be called to any Account in this
World, but by the Stings of their own Con&s;ciences: And it is a plain
Contradiction, after we have owned the King to be Supreme, to affirm there is
any other Superior to him, that can call him to an Account; it being a known
Maxim, <HI>Par in parem not habet Pote|&s;tatem.</HI> If then the King be
Supreme, and there be others in his Kingdom that are Su|perior to him, then he
is Supreme and not Supreme: But the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> pretend they are un|der
Stipulations of a conditional Obedience, provided the King maintains their
Rights; &s;o that the King not performing the former, they are not bound to the
latter: Whereas we are certainly bound to Subjection irre&s;pectively, to a
<HI>Caligula,</HI> as well as to an <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI>; to cruel <HI>Nero</HI>
and <HI>Domitian,</HI> as well as to courteous <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian</HI>; to the
Apo&s;tate <HI>Julian,</HI> as well as to Chri&s;tian <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI>
becau&s;e they have equal|ly their Power from God.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="203">The <HI>Jews</HI> were commanded to pray for
the Pro&s;perity of their Governours, and the Peace of <HI>Babylon,</HI> and
for the Lives of <HI>Nebuchadne|zar</HI> and <HI>Balthazar</HI>; and this was
performed in the fir&s;t and pure&s;t Ages. They were to pray for their
Emperors and Kings irre&s;pective|ly to their Religion, or Opinions in it, even
for their Heathen Per&s;ecutors: And if they mu&s;t pray for them, they mu&s;t
not certainly take up Arms again&s;t them: And if we mu&s;t not touch the
Lord's Anointed, our A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ina|tion of him is contrary to our not
touching him. <HI>Tertullian</HI> is certainly a competent Wit|ne&s;s for
<HI>Septimius Severus,</HI> and <HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> of <HI>Alexandria</HI>;
for <HI>Valerianus</HI> and <HI>Gallienus</HI>; the <HI>Gallican</HI> Church
prayed for <HI>Alericus,</HI> the Ea&s;tern for the Emperor <HI>Valerius,</HI>
an <HI>Arian,</HI> and for <HI>Theodo&s;ius</HI> the Younger, and
<HI>Valentinian</HI> III. the one a <HI>Ne&s;torian,</HI> the other a
di&s;&s;olute Per|&s;on; and their Prayers were, that God would grant them long
Life and a &s;ecure Reign, and pre&s;erve their Families in Safety, and their
Government in Peace; which are perfectly in|con&s;i&s;tent with Attempts on
their Per&s;ons, or Practices to di&s;turb the Tranquillity of their
Government. The very endeavouring it, is perfectly oppo&s;ite to the Tenor of
the Old Te&s;ta|ment, and of the Go&s;pel. King <HI>David</HI> com|mitted
tho&s;e two great Sins, of Murder and Adultery, either of which &s;ingly was
capital by the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Law; and yet we do not find him called to an
Account for them. Nay, in his penitential Confe&s;&s;ion, he only looks up to 
<PB N="183" REF="204"> God, and &s;ays, <HI>Again&s;t thee only have I
&s;inned:</HI> Which is an In&s;tance by which all Men &s;hould be guided.
Be&s;ides, for the People to have a Power to call their Prince to an Account,
is highly incon&s;i&s;tent with the Law of Nature, and is again&s;t all
Rea&s;on and Con&s;cience; for by this the People are both Complainants,
Witne&s;&s;es, Jury and Judges; a thing never heard of in any judicial
Proceeding: And yet that helli&s;h Juncto of Parliament made a High Court of
Ju&s;tice (as they called what was the Height of Inju&s;tice, and the utmo&s;t
Wickedne&s;s) to Try and Con|demn their lawful Sovereign: Such was the
mon&s;trous Impiety of the la&s;t Age! when that incomparable Monarch, the
Honour of the World, was forced to bow down his Head, and fall a &s;ad
Sacrifice to the Fury of the mo&s;t bar|barous Villains that ever appeared upon
the Stage of this World, when Men threw away a Felicity always to be reflected
on, but never to be recovered, to the World's End.</P>
<P>Thus fell the be&s;t of Kings, who&s;e Greatne&s;s of Judgment, as
well as that of his Condition, did eminently appear at his Death, in the
Cle|mency of his Nature, even in pardoning the Trea|&s;on and Malice of his
mo&s;t inveterate Enemies, who were not &s;atisfied with his Blood, but
un|hinged the be&s;t of Governments, and brought up|on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Nation nothing but Confu&s;ion and Mi&s;ery. And having thus murdered their
King, they took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Kingdom, di&s;inherited (as much as
in them lay) the lawful Heir, and by their Proclamation declared them&s;elves a
Free <PB N="184" REF="205"> State. But before I go farther, give me Leave to
give you this King's Character.</P>
<P>He was no great Scholar, his Learning con|&s;i&s;ted more in what
he had &s;een, than what he had &s;tudied: His Judgment was good, and bet|ter
than mo&s;t of his Mini&s;ters. The Misfor|tune was, that he &s;eldom depended
upon it, unle&s;s in Matters of his own Religion, where|in he was always very
&s;tiff. His Arguing was beyond Mea&s;ure civil and patient. He would &s;eldom
or never contradict any Man angrily, but would always &s;ay, by your Favour, I
think otherwi&s;e, or, I am not of your Opinion. He would di&s;courage any bold
Addre&s;s that was made to him, and did not love Strangers; and whil&s;t he was
upon his Throne, he would per|mit none to enter abruptly with him into
Bu|&s;ine&s;s. He was wi&s;er than mo&s;t of his Coun|cil, yet &s;o unhappy as
&s;eldom to follow his own Judgment. He would always (whil&s;t in his Court, be
addre&s;&s;ed to by proper Mini&s;ters, and &s;till kept up the Dignity of his
Court, limiting all Per&s;ons to Places &s;uitable to their Employ|ments and
Quality, and would there only hear them, unle&s;s he called for them in
particular. Be&s;ides the Ladies and Women who attended the King, he permitted
no Mini&s;ter to have his Wife in Court. He &s;pake but &s;lowly, and would
&s;tammer a little, when he began to &s;peak eagerly. He &s;eldom or never made
his own Di&s;patches, till his latter Days, but would &s;till mend and alter
them; and to that Purpo&s;e he would often &s;ay, he found it better to be a 
<PB N="185" REF="206"> Cabler, than a Shoemaker. As to his Religion, he was
very po&s;itive in it, and would bear no Arguments again&s;t it.</P>
<P>When the Juncto had fini&s;hed their &s;ad Tra|gedy, we &s;oon
&s;aw what followed their di&s;mal Actings; for, having got the &s;upreme Power
into their Hands, they were re&s;olved to over|act all tho&s;e who &s;hould
oppo&s;e their tyran|nical Proceedings: Neither could there be then a greater
Crime than Loyalty, whil&s;t That was only made Trea&s;on; and the Servants
having got the Sword into their Hands, they re&s;olved to improve it to their
Security: And having then a Set of Men fit for their Turns, which were the
Juncto, they would be &s;ure that none of tho&s;e who concluded the late King's
Con|ce&s;&s;ions a &s;ufficient Ground for Settlement of Peace, &s;hould &s;it
among&s;t them, but &s;hould be voted out of the Hou&s;e, and be no more
admitted to &s;it as Members: And having thus &s;ettled their own Hou&s;e,
they, in the next Place, fell upon the Hou&s;e of Lords, and vote, That the
Hou&s;e of Peers in Parliament was u&s;ele&s;s and dange|rous, and by an Act of
theirs did aboli&s;h it; but yet, that they might have the Privilege to be
elected Knights of the Shire and Burge&s;&s;es; which was fir&s;t willingly
embraced by the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> (who would play at &s;mall Game
rather than &s;it out) but the re&s;t of the Lords, &s;en&s;ible of that
&s;trange Alteration of the fun|damental Government of the Nation, publi&s;hed
the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">r Prote&s;tation again&s;t it,
in the Name of all the Peers of the Realm, being a trea&s;onable 
<PB N="186" REF="207"> Proceeding, and tyrannical U&s;urpation, of &s;ome
Members of the Hou&s;e of Commons, being a few in&s;olent and traitorous
Members of that Hou&s;e, while the better and greate&s;t Part of the Hou&s;e
were forcibly detained from thence. But it was in vain to think, by
Prote&s;tation, to re|duce tho&s;e Men to Rea&s;on, who had Swords by their
Sides, and were re&s;olved to overcome, or peri&s;h, in Maintainance of their
u&s;urped Au|thority, and aboli&s;hing whatever was right, as mo&s;t likely to
oppo&s;e their Intru&s;ion: And therefore they declared, in the Name of the
Commons of <HI>England</HI> a&s;&s;embled in Parliament (tho' they were not the
tenth Part of their Number) that they found by Experience, the Office of a King
in <HI>England,</HI> and to have the Power thereof in any one &s;ingle
Per&s;on, was unnece&s;&s;ary, and dangerous to the Liberty, Safety, Religion,
and the publick Intere&s;t of the Nation, and therefore &s;hould be
aboli&s;hed: And to the End that all Per&s;ons might more readily yield
Obedience to their u&s;urped Power, they were ab&s;olved from all Oaths made to
their late Sovereign and his Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>Thus this &s;mall Part of a &s;eeming Parliament (which was
actually di&s;&s;olved by the King's Death) acted by the Dictates of the
Council of War, for the Juncto were only the Wheels of the Government, guided
by the Will and Plea&s;ure of the Army; or rather their Tools by which they
acted, who yet thought them|&s;elves not &s;trong enough, till a third Power
was &s;et up by them, to &s;trengthen them in their <PB N="187" REF="208">
U&s;urpation. This they called a Council of State, con&s;i&s;ting of Forty
Per&s;ons, mo&s;t of which were principal Officers of the Army, to whom Power
was given to &s;ettle the Militia of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and
to di&s;po&s;e of it from time to time, as they &s;hould think fit, and that
they &s;hould execute their Powers for a Year; and an Oath was made, whereby
each Member admitted to that Council, was to declare, That he approved what the
Hou&s;e of Commons and their High Court of Ju&s;tice had done again&s;t the
late King, and their aboli&s;hing the Kingly Government and Hou&s;e of Lords;
and that the legi&s;lative and &s;upreme Power was wholly in the Hou&s;e of
Commons. This Oath Twenty One of the Forty they had named refu&s;ed to take,
but their Number was &s;oon filled up by them of as large Con&s;ciences as
them&s;elves.</P>
<P>About this time, <HI>Cromwell</HI> having been victo|rious in
<HI>Ireland,</HI> and almo&s;t conquered all there, left his Son-in-Law,
<HI>Ireton,</HI> Deputy in <HI>Ireland,</HI> to perfect the Conque&s;t of that
Kingdom, and comes over him&s;elf to <HI>London,</HI> where he was much
care&s;&s;ed by all the Officers of the new Commonwealth (for &s;o the Juncto
had declared <HI>England</HI> to be) and now the Juncto fearing le&s;t
<HI>Charles</HI> II. &s;hould join Intere&s;t with the <HI>Scots,</HI> they
provided again&s;t a Storm from thence, and ordered a con&s;iderable Body of
their Troops to lye upon the Borders near <HI>Scotland</HI>; and having an
Account that the <HI>Scots</HI> had modelled an Ar|my, with which they were
preparing to enter <HI>England, Cromwell,</HI> with &s;ome other General 
<PB N="188" REF="209"> Officers, were appointed to meet and confer with General
<HI>Fairfax,</HI> and to per&s;wade him, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Army then
upon the Borders of <HI>Scotland,</HI> might forthwith enter into that Kingdom,
and carry the War into their Country: But the General would not be &s;atisfied
in his Con|&s;cience to do that, being of the &s;ame Religion with them,
notwith&s;tanding all the Arguments that <HI>Cromwell</HI> and the other
Officers could u&s;e to per&s;wade him. In fine, he told them plain|ly, he
would rather lay down his Commi&s;&s;ion than agree with them (which was indeed
the great De&s;ign of tho&s;e Officers that then met) and &s;o they would
pre&s;s the General no farther, who&s;e Commi&s;&s;ion was pre&s;ently accepted
by the Juncto of Parliament, and <HI>Cromwell</HI> was made forthwith General
in <HI>Fairfax</HI>'s Place; and being General, he readily marched with his
Army Northwards, to the great Amazement of the <HI>Scots,</HI> who fearing an
Inva&s;ion, al|ledged the Covenant and the Articles of Paci|fication, by which
they ought not to be inva|ded without three Months Warning.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t News that General <HI>Cromwell</HI> heard from
<HI>Scotland</HI> was, that King <HI>Charles</HI> II. was landed there, and
received as their King; and that it was re&s;olved to invade <HI>England,</HI>
if the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Army did not invade them: But that the <HI>Scots</HI>
fir&s;t thought fit to &s;end to the Juncto of Par|liament, to know whether the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Marching towards <HI>Scotland</HI> was in a Defen&s;ive or
an Of|fen&s;ive Way? Whereupon the Juncto publi&s;hed, in a Declaration, their
Rea&s;ons for their Army <PB N="189" REF="210"> marching Northwards. The
<HI>Scots</HI> forthwith cho&s;e a particular Council, by who&s;e Advice and
Direction their King was to govern; who gave &s;uch general Satisfaction to the
<HI>Scots,</HI> that by Proclamation publi&s;hed at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> Cro&s;s,
they gave the King all his Royal Power; where|upon <HI>Cromwell</HI> advanced,
and &s;ent his Rea&s;ons into <HI>Scotland,</HI> of his March with his Army
in|to that Kingdom, and &s;oon after advanced to <HI>Dunbar,</HI> where both
Armies were near each other; but the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> beginning to want
Pro|vi&s;ions, <HI>Cromwell</HI> re&s;olved to retreat, before his Army was put
to Extremity. But the <HI>Scots</HI> pre&s;&s;ed hard upon them, and the
Pre&s;byterian Mini&s;ters in the Army encouraged the <HI>Scots</HI> to fight,
contrary to the Opinion of their Gene|ral, and other principal Officers, who
advi&s;ed rather to make a Bridge for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Army to pa&s;s
quietly homewards, than to hinder or oppo&s;e them. But the Mini&s;ters carried
for Fighting; and the Day before the Engagement, the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;eemed
&s;o &s;ure of Victory (by Encou|ragement from their Mini&s;ters, who &s;aid it
was the Lord's Battle) that they con&s;ulted of &s;en|ding Propo&s;itions to
the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that they &s;hould have Leave to pa&s;s into
<HI>England</HI> with their Swords only, leaving their Cannon and Ammunition
behind them. 'Tis true, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were then in a very &s;ad
Condition, many &s;ick and wanting Provi&s;ions, the Pa&s;&s;es before them
&s;topt, the <HI>Scots</HI> Army on one Side of them, the Sea on the other, and
the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> behind them. The General &s;eeing no Way to 
<PB N="190" REF="211"> e&s;cape, without making his Way thro' them, re&s;olved
to fight, in that de&s;perate Condition, and after one Hour's warm Di&s;pute,
the <HI>Scots</HI> were defeated, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> obtained an
en|tire Victory, whereby the Scene was &s;o much changed, that the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were forced to break the Pikes and Mu&s;kets they took, not
having Conveniency of &s;ending them for <HI>England.</HI> It &s;eems the
<HI>Scots</HI> pur&s;ued the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to <HI>Dunbar,</HI> and
pre&s;&s;ed &s;o hard upon them (thinking they had them in a Net) that the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> could not retire without fighting; by which they got &s;o
compleat a Victory, that General <HI>Cromwell</HI> was Ma&s;ter, that very Day,
both of <HI>Leith</HI> and <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>
<P>The News of this Defeat being brought to the King, he was
plea&s;ed to &s;ay, he thanked God he was &s;o rid of the <HI>Scots,</HI> that
their Kirk might then &s;ee their Error in prohibiting their King from being in
Per&s;on with their Army, and keeping out the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and the
re&s;t of the King's Followers, who, in all Probability, had prevented their
great Misfortune. However, their King was crowned &s;oon after at
<HI>Scone,</HI> tho' the <HI>Scotch</HI> Mini&s;ters preached, that their
Defeat was occa&s;ioned by their too much Com|pliance with their King, to whom
mo&s;t of the <HI>Scotch</HI> Lords adhered: But &s;ome Commanders with the
Kirk were of a contrary Opinion, and would by all means purge the King's
Hou&s;hold. However, the <HI>Scots</HI> rai&s;e a new Army, whom the King in
Per&s;on would command; the Duke of <HI>Hamilton</HI> is made Lieutenant
General, <HI>David</HI> <PB N="191" REF="212"> <HI>Le&s;ley</HI> Major General,
<HI>Middleton</HI> Lieutenant General of the Hor&s;e, and <HI>Ma&s;&s;y</HI>
Major Gene|ral of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>; and with this Army the King hoped to
get bye the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and to make the Seat of the War in
<HI>England.</HI> But after a long and terrible March, wherein were &s;everal
Engagements, with different Succe&s;s, the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> being in the
Rear, and on all Sides of the <HI>Scots</HI>; &s;o that mo&s;t of the
Engagements were to the King's Di&s;advantage, who at la&s;t arrived at
<HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> with his &s;hattered Army, where he was beaten by General
<HI>Cromwell,</HI> the Third Day of <HI>September,</HI> as he had done the Year
be|fore at <HI>Dunbar.</HI> After this total Defeat, the King e&s;caped, and
was miraculou&s;ly pre&s;erved for a better Fortune, and to &s;ee the Murderers
of his late Royal Father, at lea&s;t &s;ome of the principal of them, mo&s;t
ju&s;tly and de&s;ervedly puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>After the Succe&s;s of this Battle, General <HI>Cromwell</HI> went
to <HI>London,</HI> and was highly ca|re&s;&s;ed by all, and having then a
Vacation from military Labours, he had Time to juggle with his Officers, to
advance his Power; for tho' he then governed as King, and the Juncto of
Parliament acted only according to his Dictates, yet he &s;eemed not &s;o great
as he de&s;ired, whil&s;t he only acted as Ma&s;ter, under the Title of a
Servant; and finding the Juncto did not proceed in all things according to his
Mind, he re&s;ol|ved to take the Power wholly into his own Hands, that it might
clearly appear what he was in effect: And to this Purpo&s;e he got the 
<PB N="192" REF="213"> Con&s;ent of mo&s;t of the Officers of the Army, who
were his Creatures, to be willing he &s;hould break the Juncto of Parliament.
But before he would execute any Part of this, which with|in him&s;elf he had
long before de&s;igned, and now being ripe for Execution, he held a long
Conference with an eminent Per&s;on, upon who&s;e Opinion and Judgment he much
relied, and declared to him his Di&s;&s;atisfaction with the Parliament's
Proceedings, and that he would do nothing therein without his Advice, who was
at this time a Member of Parliament, and in great E&s;teem among them. This
Gentle|man with whom <HI>Cromwell</HI> then conferred, told him freely, that
&s;ince he governed all at pre|&s;ent, and that the Juncto of Parliament did
nothing without his Con&s;ent, he thought it be&s;t that he &s;hould continue
General as he was, ha|ving the whole Government in his Hands, un|le&s;s he
would take upon him the Title of King, and then he might govern &s;afely, and
tho&s;e that &s;erved under him would be in no Danger, he being King <HI>de
facto,</HI> according to an Act of Parliament made in the Eleventh of
<HI>Henry</HI> VII. which was &s;till in Force: But <HI>Cromwell</HI>
ab&s;o|lutely refu&s;ed this, becau&s;e he knew he could never get the Officers
of the Army their Con|&s;ent to it, nor &s;ome of his own near Relations, who
&s;wore they would kill him, if ever he took that Title upon him. This
Conference puts me in Mind of what Mr. <HI>Hambden</HI> &s;aid to the Lord
<HI>Digby,</HI> in the Beginning of the War, as they were going down the
Parliament Stairs. <PB N="193" REF="214"> <HI>Cromwell</HI> going ju&s;t before
them, the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> (who was then a great Man in the Hou&s;e of
Commons) a&s;ked <HI>Hambden,</HI> who that Man was? <HI>for I &s;ee,</HI>
&s;aith the Lord <HI>Digby, he is of our Side, by his &s;peaking &s;o warmly
this Day:</HI> Upon which Mr. <HI>Hambden</HI> replied, <HI>That &s;loven|ly
Fellow, which you &s;ee before us, who hath no Ornament in his Speech: I &s;ay,
that Sloven, if we &s;hould ever come to have a Breach with the King, (which
God forbid) I &s;ay, that Slo|ven, in &s;uch Ca&s;e, will be one of the
greate&s;t Men of</HI> England; which was a prophetical Speech: But
<HI>Hambden</HI> knew him well, and was intimately acquainted with him.</P>
<P>Now, after this Conference between <HI>Cromwell</HI> and that
other Per&s;on, a Member of Parlia|ment, finding <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s
Aver&s;ene&s;s to what he propo&s;ed, he told him, there was but one other Way
that he knew, whereby <HI>Cromwell</HI> might make him&s;elf and Family as
great as he plea&s;ed, but that he would not propo&s;e it, without fir&s;t
having an A&s;&s;urance from his Excellency, that he would not take it ill what
he &s;hould &s;ay, nor mention it to any other; both which <HI>Crom|well</HI>
promi&s;ed him upon his Faith and Honour: And when the Gentleman di&s;clo&s;ed
him&s;elf farther to <HI>Cromwell,</HI> advertizing him what he might do, to
his own eternal Honour, and to what Advantage he plea&s;ed, for all his Family,
his Excellency told the Gentleman, that it was a Matter of the greate&s;t
Importance, and would require a good Time to con&s;ider of it. But his
Excellency never &s;poke one Word more to that <PB N="194" REF="215"> Gentleman
about it; and finding by that Gentle|man's Di&s;cour&s;e, that he was not like
to approve of what he intended, his Excellency &s;oon found a Way to have him
&s;ent a foreign Amba&s;&s;ador, whil&s;t he continued his fir&s;t
Re&s;olution; in or|der to which, he fir&s;t erects a Council of Offi|cers, who
expo&s;tulate with the Parliament about their Arrears, and the Di&s;&s;olution
of the Par|liament, which occa&s;ioned a long Debate in the Hou&s;e, where it
was re&s;olved they would con|tinue their Power: Whereupon General
<HI>Crom|well,</HI> in the Month of <HI>April</HI> 1653, comes into the Hou&s;e
with &s;ome of his Generals, and a File of Mu&s;queteers, and di&s;&s;olves the
Juncto of Parliament, and after declares his Rea&s;ons for it, to give the
People Satisfaction.</P>
<P>In this he was obeyed, tho' with &s;ome Mur|muring and Reluctancy
of the Members. He then bid his Soldiers take away the Fool's Bau|ble, their
Mace. The Speaker being unwil|ling to leave his Chair, was pulled out of it by
Collonel <HI>Harri&s;on,</HI> and <HI>Cromwell</HI> &s;at down in it, and
&s;tayed in the Hou&s;e, till he &s;aw all the Members out, and then he
cau&s;ed the Doors to be locked up, to the great Content of the Nation, who
then judged a wor&s;e Slavery could not befal them, tho' they expected little
Liber|ty or Freedom from him into who&s;e Hands the Power then fell. This
Action was certainly a much higher Affront than what the Hou&s;e of Commons
took &s;o ill from the late King, that one of their own Members &s;hould &s;o
violently turn them all out.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="216">Thus this Juncto of Parliament was at this
time treated by tho&s;e that had &s;et them up, and took their Commi&s;&s;ions
and Authority from them; nor could the Army ju&s;tify any Action they had done,
or one Drop of Blood they had &s;pilt, but by their Authority. The Servants
ro&s;e up again&s;t their Ma&s;ters, and di&s;&s;olved that Power by which they
were created Officers and Soldiers, and then the Army took (what they had long
&s;ince de&s;igned) all Power into their own Hands; and after the Parliament
had &s;ub|dued all their Enemies, they were overthrown and ruined by their own
Servants, and tho&s;e whom they had rai&s;ed, pulled down their Ma|&s;ters; an
Example very &s;trange! by which we &s;ee how uncertain all worldly Affairs
are, and how apt to fall, when they think them at the highe&s;t Point: And
&s;oon after this Di&s;&s;olution, the General gave his Rea&s;ons in Print to
&s;atisfy the Nation why he had di&s;&s;olved them, in a long Declaration.</P>
<P>By this Di&s;&s;olution, <HI>Cromwell</HI> was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of the Three Kingdoms, having both the legi&s;la|tive and military Power in his
Hands; and therefore he thought fit to chu&s;e &s;everal Per|&s;ons to be the
&s;upreme Government, who met at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> and called
them&s;elves a Par|liament, and cho&s;e one Mr. <HI>Rou&s;e</HI> for their
Speaker, who had the u&s;ual Ceremonies belon|ging to that Office, and this was
by Nick-name called <HI>Barebone</HI>'s Parliament, becau&s;e he was a Member
of it, being at that time a Leather-Seller in <HI>Fleet&s;treet.</HI> But this
Parliament not <PB N="196" REF="217"> agreeing among&s;t them&s;elves, (tho'
they were but an Hundred and Forty) after &s;ome &s;hort Time, they re&s;ign
their Power to <HI>Cromwell</HI> who gave it them. Then <HI>Cromwell</HI> is
declared by his Council, or by the In&s;trument of Govern|ment, as they called
it, Protector of the Com|monwealth of <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and
<HI>Ireland,</HI> and proclaimed &s;o in the u&s;ual Places as the Kings
formerly were; and in this extraordina|ry Manner he mounted the Throne of the
Three Kingdoms, without the Name of a King, but with greater Power and
Authority than any King, and received greater E&s;teem and Re&s;pect from all
the Princes of Chri&s;tendom, than ever had been &s;hewed to any Monarch of the
Three Nations: For tho' they all abhorred him, yet they trembled at his Power,
and courted his Friend&s;hip. After he had &s;ufficiently beaten the
<HI>Dutch,</HI> he made a Peace with them, and obliged <HI>Portugal</HI> to
&s;end an Amba&s;&s;ador to make Peace, and pro&s;ecuted all tho&s;e of the
King's Party that were at home, with the utmo&s;t Ri|gour and Cruelty, and
erected a High Court of Ju&s;tice, for Tryal of &s;uch as &s;hould ri&s;e, or
plot any thing again&s;t him, and many were executed upon that Account. He made
his younge&s;t Son <HI>Henry</HI> Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ire|land:</HI> But
<HI>England</HI> proved not &s;o as he ex|pected; for the mo&s;t con&s;iderable
Men that were in the Hou&s;e of Commons, from the time that he di&s;&s;olved
them, poi&s;oned the Affections of the People towards the Government, and yet
carried them&s;elves &s;o warily, that they did <PB N="197" REF="218"> not
di&s;turb the Peace of the Nation. And tho' <HI>Cromwell</HI> was then
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;ove|reign Power, yet he thought him&s;elf not
&s;ecure, till he had the Con&s;ent of the People in Parlia|ment; and
therefore, according to his Power in the In&s;trument of Government, he
&s;ummo|ned a Parliament, which met at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> the Third Day
of <HI>September</HI> 1654, the famous Day of his two great Victories at
<HI>Dunbar</HI> and <HI>Wor|ce&s;ter,</HI> and in this Parliament
<HI>Lenthall</HI> was cho|&s;en Speaker. This he thought was the only Way to
have the People entirely &s;ubmit to him, and he ordered it &s;o, that no
Per&s;on who had ever been again&s;t the Parliament, during the time of the
Civil War, or the Sons of any &s;uch Per&s;on, &s;hould be cho&s;en.
<HI>Cromwell</HI> came into the Hou&s;e, and allowed the Speaker: The fir&s;t
Speech that was made among&s;t them, was to know by what Authority they came
thither? And whether he that had convened them, had a lawful Power to do it?
And tho' the Pro|tector's Creatures endeavoured to direct them, yet many of the
Members declared again&s;t the Power: And one more bold than others &s;aid,
<HI>That as God had made him in&s;trumental of cut|ting down Tyranny in one
Man; &s;o now he could not endure to &s;ee the Nation's Liberties &s;hackled by
another, who had no Right to the Govern|ment, but by the Length of his
Sword.</HI> The Continuance of this warm Debate la&s;ted for &s;ome Days, which
much perplexed the Prote|ctor, who &s;ent for the Parliament to him in the
<HI>Banqueting-Hou&s;e,</HI> and told them in his canting <PB N="198" REF="219"> Tone, that he was &s;orry to hear they were fal|ling into Heats and
Divi&s;ions, and declared, that the &s;ame Government that made him Pro|tector,
had made them a Parliament; and that therefore no Man was to &s;it in that
Hou&s;e, that did not fir&s;t take an Engagement, which he had cau&s;ed to be
made, which many refu&s;ed to take, as being again&s;t their Privileges, and a
Guard was &s;et at the Door of the Hou&s;e, that none &s;hould enter that had
not taken it; and not|with&s;tanding many refu&s;ed entering upon that Account,
yet the Re&s;idue proved &s;o re&s;ty, that he was obliged to di&s;&s;olve
them; which he did, and &s;aid, he could do his Bu&s;ine&s;s without them. It
was about this time, that <HI>Wildman</HI> and <HI>Lil|burn,</HI> the two great
Levellers, were taken and pro&s;ecuted, but <HI>Lilburn</HI> more &s;everely
than the other; and tho' he was accu&s;ed and tryed for High-Trea&s;on, yet the
Jury found him Not Guilty. He told the People at his Tryal, <HI>That all</HI>
Engli&s;hmen <HI>were obliged to oppo&s;e</HI> Cromwell<HI>'s Tyranny, as he
had done purely for their &s;akes, to pre&s;erve them from being Slaves:</HI>
And tho' he was acquitted, yet <HI>Cromwell</HI> never &s;uffered him to be
&s;et at Liberty, but &s;till kept him inclo&s;ed from Pri&s;on to Pri&s;on,
till he him|&s;elf died.</P>
<P>After the Di&s;&s;olution of the Parliament, <HI>Cromwell</HI> not
thinking him&s;elf &s;ecure in the Government, he invented a new Chimera to
keep the People in Awe, which was the Go|vernment by the Major Generals, and
the whole Kingdom was divided among&s;t them, being <PB N="199" REF="220">
Eleven in all: The&s;e were principally employed to decimate Delinquents
E&s;tates, and gave them great Power to value what the Tenth Part of every
&s;uch E&s;tate did amount to, and every Man was to pay what they thought fit,
and upon Neglect, the Per&s;on to be impri&s;oned, and his whole E&s;tate
&s;eque&s;tered. But finding the&s;e Major Generals were very odious to all
Parties, and fearing they might in the End undermine his own Greatne&s;s, and
govern like <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Ba&s;&s;aws, he &s;oon put an End to their
Power, believing they eclip&s;ed his Glory.</P>
<P>Then the <HI>Jews</HI> offered <HI>Cromwell</HI> a great Sum of
Money, that they might be permitted to traffick freely; but the City and
principal Merchants therein being much again&s;t it, that Project failed him.
After, in the Year 1656, <HI>Cromwell</HI> (who was then called Protector of
the Commonwealth of <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ire|land,</HI> &amp;c.)
&s;ummoned another Parliament, who met accordingly, and remembring the Speeches
and Carriages of many Members of the late Parliament, he gave &s;ecret Advice
to the Sheriffs of the &s;everal Counties, to hinder, if po&s;&s;ible, their
being cho&s;en; but this Advice proved fruitle&s;s in mo&s;t Places. However,
the Parliament met, and before they were permit|ted to enter the Hou&s;e, they
were to &s;ub&s;cribe a Recognition, that they would act nothing that was
prejudicial to the Government, as e&s;tabli&s;hed by a Protector: Whereupon
many Members cho&s;e rather to return home; but the Major Part &s;igned the
Recognition, entered the <PB N="200" REF="221"> Hou&s;e, and cho&s;e Sir
<HI>Thomas Withrington</HI> Spea|ker, who acted &s;uitably to the Protector's
De|&s;ires in every thing. The Parliament pre&s;&s;ed <HI>Cromwell</HI>
mightily to be King, which <HI>Cromwell</HI> po&s;itively refu&s;ed; but his
Refu&s;al &s;eemed not in the lea&s;t di&s;advantageous; for that by a new
In&s;trument, which was called the Humble Peti|tion and Advice, they granted
him not only the Authority of Protector for his Life, but al&s;o a Power to
declare his Succe&s;&s;or; and when they had agreed upon this, they de&s;ired
an Audience, which he gave them in the <HI>Banqueting-Hou&s;e,</HI> the Twenty
Fifth of <HI>May</HI> 1657, where their Speaker, <HI>Withrington,</HI>
pre&s;ented and read the Petition and Advice of his Parliament, and de&s;ired
his A&s;&s;ent to it, which the Protector then &s;igned, and made a long
Harangue to them, and was &s;olemnly in|augurated in
<HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall,</HI> and adjourned the Parliament till
<HI>January</HI> following.</P>
<P>And thus the Parliament having done all that could be expected
from them, he would do &s;omething for him&s;elf, who&s;e Greatne&s;s, in that
Vacancy, was &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed, both at Home and Abroad, that it
&s;eemed as if it could never be &s;haken. He was confirmed in his Power with
the Title of Protector, and took his Oath accordingly, and was proclaimed
Protector in the u&s;ual Places as the Kings for|merly were, and &s;olemnly
inaugurated in <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter-Hall.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>January</HI> the Parliament met; but new In&s;titutions in
Government are often un&s;ecure, for a Gap was left open, which none of the 
<PB N="201" REF="222"> Contrivers of the new Government thought of, there being
one Article in <HI>The Humble Pe|tition and Advice,</HI> to which
<HI>Cromwell</HI> had a&s;&s;en|ted and &s;worn, <HI>That no Member lawfully
cho&s;en &s;hould be excluded, but by the Con&s;ent of that Hou&s;e of which he
was a Member</HI>; and pro|ceeding to the calling over their Hou&s;e, all
tho&s;e who had been before refu&s;ed Entrance, for not &s;igning the
Recognition, were admitted, where|by above One Hundred of the mo&s;t inveterate
Enemies of the Protector came and &s;at in the Hou&s;e: But <HI>Cromwell</HI>
thought he had &s;ufficient|ly provided for his Security, to re&s;train the
In&s;olency of the Hou&s;e of Commons, by having called the other Hou&s;e,
which by the Petition and Advice was to be done, and filled it for the mo&s;t
Part with Officers of the Army, and of his &s;ure&s;t Friends, and that were
firmly fixed to the Protector's Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>When the Adjournment ended, and the Hou&s;es met,
<HI>Cromwell</HI> came to the Upper Hou&s;e, and &s;ent the Black Rod for the
Hou&s;e of Commons to attend him; and being in his Chair of State, he began his
Speech in the old Style, <HI>My Lords, and you the Knights, Citizens, and
Burge&s;&s;es of the Hou&s;e of Commons.</HI> So &s;oon as the Com|mons
returned to their Hou&s;e, they began to que&s;tion the Authority and
Juri&s;diction of the other Hou&s;e: That tho' the Petition and Advice admitted
there &s;hould be another Hou&s;e, but that it &s;hould be a Hou&s;e of Peers,
and they be called My Lords, there was no &s;uch Provi&s;ion; nor did it appear
what Juri&s;diction they &s;hould <PB N="202" REF="223"> have; and that it
would be ridiculous for them, who &s;at only by their Vote, no better Men than
them&s;elves, to have a negative Voice to controul their Ma&s;ters; and they
e&s;teemed it as a thing made on Purpo&s;e to mock them: And then they began to
que&s;tion the Protector's Au|thority, how his Highne&s;s came to place them in
the Hou&s;e of Peers, at which the Commons were much di&s;gu&s;ted: Of which
the Protector being advertized, he was &s;trangely &s;urprized, and found he
had been &s;hort-&s;ighted, in not having proceeded at the &s;ame time, to fill
up his Hou&s;e of Commons, when he erected his other of Peers. However, he
forthwith con|vened both Hou&s;es, and reprehended the Hou&s;e of Commons for
pre&s;uming to que&s;tion his Au|thority: The other Hou&s;e, he &s;aid, were
Lords, and &s;hould be Lords, and commanded them to enter upon &s;uch
Bu&s;ine&s;s as might be for the Benefit, not De&s;truction of the
Commonwealth, which he would by God's Help prevent: But finding his
Animadver&s;ions did not reform them, but that they continued their former
Pre&s;um|ption, and knowing the Tickli&s;hne&s;s of his Time would not endure
Di&s;putes, e&s;pecially as to his Pageant Lords, whom he had newly erected: He
therefore &s;ent the Black Rod for the Hou&s;e of Commons, the Fourth of
<HI>February,</HI> and after having u&s;ed many &s;harp Expre&s;&s;ions of
Indig|nation, he told them, it concerned his Intere&s;t as much as the Peace of
the Nation, to di&s;&s;olve them, and accordingly he did di&s;&s;olve them: And
to &s;hew how little he feared tho&s;e Men <PB N="203" REF="224"> who
contradicted him at home, he &s;ent imme|diately for <HI>Lambert,</HI> and took
away his Com|mi&s;&s;ion, and removed him from the Army, who forthwith retired,
and was as little taken notice of, as if he had never been in Authority; which
gave great Reputation to the Protector, and &s;hewed he was Ma&s;ter of his
Army.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e warm Debates were in Agita|tion at home, about
the Protector's Govern|ment, he was &s;o cunning as to make Treaties and
Leagues abroad, and was publickly owned by many Kingdoms and States; and it was
about this time, that the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> with Conjun|ction of the
<HI>French,</HI> took <HI>Dunkirk</HI> and <HI>Graveling</HI>; the fir&s;t of
which was by by Agreement garri|&s;oned by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and Sir
<HI>William Lockhart,</HI> a <HI>Scotchman,</HI> made Governour; and
<HI>Graveling</HI> was garri&s;oned by the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>But during the&s;e Succe&s;&s;es abroad, the King was fir&s;t at
<HI>Cologne,</HI> where he was well received and treated, before which, his
Family was in great Di&s;order at <HI>Paris</HI>; but being at
<HI>Cologne,</HI> it was put under the Care and Management of Sir <HI>Stephen
Fox,</HI> who had the Di&s;po&s;al of all, and he there kept the King's Hou&s;e
and Family for about Six Hundred Pi&s;toles a Month; but his Maje&s;ty never
kept a Coach all the time he was at <HI>Cologne.</HI> From thence his Maje&s;ty
went to <HI>Bruges</HI> in <HI>Flanders,</HI> where he &s;tayed in the Year
1657; and after he had been there &s;ome time, Six Thou&s;and Guilders was
&s;ettled month|ly for him&s;elf and Family; and Half that Sum (I mean Half as
much more) for Support of <PB N="204" REF="225"> the Dukes of <HI>York</HI> and
<HI>Glouce&s;ter.</HI> He was then to rai&s;e Four Regiments of Foot; the
fir&s;t Regiment for his own Guards, commanded by the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI>;
but they were to do their Duty in the Army as common Men, till his Maje&s;ty
was in Condition to bring them about his Per&s;on. The Earl of <HI>Ormond</HI>
had the &s;e|cond Regiment, the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> the third, and the
fourth was given to the Earl of <HI>New|burgh,</HI> a <HI>Scotch</HI> Nobleman,
who had &s;erved the King with great Fidelity: And the&s;e four Re|giments were
&s;oon rai&s;ed. Whil&s;t the King was at <HI>Bruges, Cromwell</HI> exerci&s;ed
all imaginary Tyranny in his Government: The King's Heart was almo&s;t broken
with the daily Informations he received, of the Ruine and De&s;truction his
loyal Party underwent, and the Butchery acted upon them, and the extreme
Tyranny <HI>Cromwell</HI> exerci&s;ed over the whole Nation, was then very
grievous to his Maje&s;ty, &s;eeing no End of it.</P>
<P><HI>Scotland</HI> was then governed by a Rod of Iron, &s;ubdued by
tho&s;e whom they had fir&s;t taught to rebel, and with whom they had joined to
de&s;troy their own natural Prince, and di&s;&s;ol|ved that Monarchy which had
been ever &s;ince they were a Nation; and tho&s;e who had u&s;ed to practi&s;e
&s;uch ill Behaviour towards their King, were then contemned, and made Slaves
to the meane&s;t of the People, who pre&s;cribed them new Laws to which they
had never been accu|&s;tomed. The King then &s;aw tho&s;e, who were the
Beginners and fir&s;t Authors of our publick <PB N="205" REF="226"> Calamities,
&s;o much Sharers therein, that they were no more Ma&s;ters of their own.
E&s;tates, than they were whom they had fir&s;t &s;poiled; and that no Part of
the new Government was in their Hands who had pulled down the old; and that
after Monarchy had &s;eemed &s;o odious to them, their whole Nation was at the
Di&s;po&s;al of a &s;ingle Per&s;on; and that tho&s;e <HI>Scotch</HI> Lords,
without who&s;e traitorous A&s;&s;i&s;tance the Scepter could never have been
wre&s;ted out of the Hands of their King, were now reckoned among&s;t the
Dreggs of the People, and &s;o numbred. This could not but give &s;ome
Satisfaction to King <HI>Charles</HI> II. to &s;ee God's Judgments fallen upon
them, who were the principal Cau&s;e of our Rebellion in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But before I go farther, I will beg Leave here to give you
<HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Character, both before and after he came to be Protector.
At the fir&s;t Beginning of the Long Parliament, when he heard any Man &s;peak
of the Troubles of the Nation, he would weep mo&s;t bitterly, and appear the
mo&s;t afflicted Per&s;on in the World, with the Sen&s;e of the Calamities that
were likely to arrive: But the wi&s;er &s;ort of Men in the Hou&s;e of Commons
&s;oon di&s;covered his wicked Intentions, and his great Hypocri&s;y was no
longer concealed from them. Nothing more perplexed him, than the Death of his
dear Daughter <HI>Claypole,</HI> who was troubled at nothing &s;o much, before
her Death, as at the Blood her Father had &s;pilt; and it was believed &s;he
had repre&s;ented his wor&s;t Actions to him, <PB N="206" REF="227"> and yet he
never made the lea&s;t Shew of any Remor&s;e or Repentance for any of his
Actions. He could never have done half that Mi&s;chief he did, without having
great Parts of Indu&s;try, Courage, and Judgment. He mu&s;t have had a
wonderful In&s;ight into the Affections and Hu|mours of Men, who from a private
Birth, with|out any Intere&s;t, E&s;tate, or Alliance, could rai&s;e him&s;elf
to &s;o great a Height: He attempted that which no good Man dur&s;t undertake,
and performed that which none but a wicked vali|ant Man could &s;ucceed in.
There was certain|ly never a more wicked Man, nor one that ever brought to
pa&s;s what he de&s;igned more wicked|ly. He con&s;ulted very few, and when he
had once taken a Re&s;olution, he would not be di&s;|&s;waded from it. He was
never unfortunate in any of his Undertakings abroad, but only in that of
<HI>Pen</HI> and <HI>Venables,</HI> who were &s;ent out by him with a Fleet and
Land Army, in 1655, and had ill Succe&s;s. In fine, to reduce Three Nations,
who perfectly hated him, into an in|tire Obedience, and to govern them with a
Rod of Iron, by an Army that wi&s;hed his utter Ru|ine, was an In&s;tance of a
prodigious Addre&s;s, and &s;hewed, that he was born for the Ruine of our
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation.</P>
<P>But yet, after all his Greatne&s;s both at home and abroad, &s;ome
things happened before his End, which much di&s;turbed him; not only the
frequent Plots again&s;t his Per&s;on, but the Co|ming up of a mon&s;trous
Whale in the fre&s;h Wa|ter, contrary to the Nature of that Fi&s;h, as 
<PB N="207" REF="228"> far as <HI>Greenwich,</HI> where it was taken, and
be|lieved by many to portend &s;ome great Alteration in the Commonwealth: Yet
this did not &s;o much trouble the Protector, as the Death of his dear Daughter
<HI>Claypole,</HI> who died in the Beginning of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1658. He had
&s;ettled his greate&s;t Affection upon this Daughter, from the time of who&s;e
Death he appeared very melancholy, and fell &s;ick about the Middle of
<HI>Augu&s;t</HI>; but his Sickne&s;s being only an Ague, there was no
Ap|prehen&s;ions of his Death; and he declared pub|lickly to his Phy&s;icians,
and many others, <HI>That God would not take him away, till he done &s;ome more
Work for him.</HI> But it &s;oon appeared, that if God did not, the Devil did
take him; for he died the Third of <HI>September</HI> following: A Day that had
been &s;o fortunate to him proved his la&s;t in this World; and &s;uch a
Tempe&s;t ac|companied his Death that Night, as was not &s;een in the Memory of
Man: Great Trees in <HI>St. James</HI>'s Park were blown up by the Roots, of
which I was an Eye Witne&s;s. The large &s;trong Pales, which made up the
Breach on <HI>London</HI> Bridge (cau&s;ed by a violent Fire &s;ome Years
before) were blown down; many Boats ca&s;t away upon the <HI>Thames,</HI> great
Shipwrecks at Sea, be&s;ides &s;everal by the Storm, in divers Parts of
<HI>England,</HI> by Land. The Prince of the Air &s;hewed his Power was above
the Pro|tector's, who thought not fit that he &s;hould part quietly out of this
World, who had made &s;uch a Combu&s;tion, Trouble, and Mi&s;ery in it. He was
a Per&s;on indeed, who, by his Arts of Di&s;|&s;embling, <PB N="208" REF="229">
Wickedne&s;s, and Murder, attained to the Height of Greatne&s;s: He made
foreign Nations know more of <HI>England</HI>'s Strength, than any of our Kings
of late Years had done. Be&s;ides, he had all Parts of Policy &s;o
nece&s;&s;ary for an U&s;urper, and had &s;o perfectly learnt the Art of
Di&s;&s;embling, that, with his Eyes lifted up to Heaven (who&s;e Heart was far
from it) and his Hand laid on his Brea&s;t, he would pray, cry, and act the
Saint, till he had fully accom|pli&s;hed his De&s;igns.</P>
<P>After <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Death, his Son <HI>Richard</HI> be|ing
named in the Petition and Advice, &s;ucceeded as Protector; but having nothing
of his late Father's Spirit or Parts, was unfit to hold what his late Father
had got, and &s;o was quickly turned out and depo&s;ed by his ambitious and
jealous Kindred, without drawing his Sword for it. Then, at the Army's Call,
that filthy Part of the Commons called the Juncto, retur|ned back to govern;
who not plea&s;ing their over-powerful Ma&s;ters, the Army, they were a
&s;econd time expul&s;ed by the Army. Then a Creature of the Army's begetting
(with a new Name of their own devi&s;ing) called, <HI>The Com|mittee of
Safety,</HI> was &s;ub&s;tituted, which occa|&s;ioned a great Difference
betwixt the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Scotch</HI> Army, the latter declaring a
great Di&s;&s;atisfaction again&s;t the Proceedings of the former, and the
Conte&s;t ended by the Divi&s;i|ons in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Army, their
Mutinery and Mouldring away, whil&s;t the <HI>Scotch</HI> Army, un|der the
Command of the prudent <HI>Fabius,</HI> Gene|ral <PB N="209" REF="230">
<HI>Monk,</HI> advanced towards <HI>London,</HI> who&s;e Coming and De&s;ign
had been prevented, if timorous <HI>Fleetwood</HI> had made good his Promi&s;e
of &s;ending fir&s;t to the King, the Great Seal, with the Keeper of it, to
a&s;&s;ure his Maje&s;ty of their Repentance and Re&s;olution to call in the
King; which was agreed betwixt <HI>Fleetwood</HI> and the Keeper, who was ready
to go with the Great Seal: But &s;ome Officers, then in Being in the Army,
oppo&s;ed <HI>Fleetwood</HI>'s Re&s;olution, who had before promi&s;ed them to
do nothing without their Con&s;ent, of that Nature; and &s;o the whole
Bu&s;ine&s;s was &s;et a&s;ide, when the Keeper was ready to go with the Great
Seal.</P>
<P>It was the King's great Happine&s;s, that <HI>Monk</HI> never
owned his De&s;ign of &s;erving the King, till it fell in his Power. If he had
declared his Re&s;olution &s;ooner, he had de&s;troyed him&s;elf; and the
A&s;&s;urance that the Parliament had, that <HI>Monk</HI> had no &s;uch
Intention, hindered tho&s;e Ob&s;tructions which probably would have ruined his
Credit with his own Army, and united the re&s;t of the Forces again&s;t him. It
is true, that he was the In&s;trument to bring that to pa&s;s, which certainly
he had neither Wi&s;dom to fore|&s;ee, nor Under&s;tanding to contrive, he
being a phlegmatick dull Per&s;on, till he was awakened by his Officers, who
thought him in great Dan|ger by pulling down the Gates of the City of
<HI>London:</HI> And therefore his Officers per&s;waded him to march again into
the City, and then he declared to the Citizens (at Alderman <HI>Wate</HI>'s
Hou&s;e) whom I knew very well, and at which <PB N="210" REF="231"> time I
lodged at Mr. <HI>Clargy</HI>'s Hou&s;e, an Apo|thecary near
<HI>Charing-Cro&s;s,</HI> who&s;e Si&s;ter was married to <HI>Monk.</HI> This
Apothecary was a very active &s;tirring Man, and full of Intrigues, and I
believe he prevailed much with his Brother <HI>Monk,</HI> to induce him to do
what he did: For, whil&s;t he was at Alderman <HI>Wate</HI>'s, he then
a&s;&s;ured the Citizens, that he would live and die with them, which gave them
great Joy, and put the Parliament in &s;ome Di&s;order; where|upon they &s;ent
&s;ome Members to treat with him, upon which he returned to <HI>Whitehall,</HI>
and then &s;ent for the Members of both Parties, for tho&s;e that were turned
out of Parliament in the Year 1648, and delivers a Paper to them in Writing,
which his Secretary read to them; and then they all thought, that he really
in|tended the E&s;tabli&s;hing a Commonwealth: But no &s;ooner was the
Conference ended, but the Members that had been excluded from 1648, entered the
Hou&s;e of Commons, and pre&s;ently di&s;&s;olved them&s;elves; which really
contributed as much to his Maje&s;ty's Service, as if really <HI>Monk</HI> had
de&s;igned it at the fir&s;t: But whether he did, or did not, I think is yet a
great Que|&s;tion, the wi&s;e&s;t among&s;t us believing he never at fir&s;t
intended it, but that it fell into his Lap, to make our Nation happy, by
re&s;toring the right Heir to the Crown, without the A&s;&s;i|&s;tance of any
foreign Prince, which was a Hap|pine&s;s beyond our Expectation or
De&s;ert.</P>
<P>But before the almo&s;t miraculous Re&s;toration of King
<HI>Charles</HI> II. and his coming to the Go|vernment, <PB N="211" REF="232">
I think &s;omething may be &s;aid, tho' not in Vindication, yet in Mitigation,
of the Crimes committed by &s;ome Members in that Long Parliament, in which
unhappy Times the Crown was even laid in the Du&s;t, and the Ju&s;tice of the
King's Cau&s;e did not prevail again&s;t tho&s;e malignant Spirits (who had
de|&s;igned the King's Ruine) and had mi&s;led and corrupted the
Under&s;tandings of many of his Maje&s;ty's Subjects, who were over-per&s;waded
by the &s;pecious Shew of <HI>Salus Populi &s;uprema Lex,</HI> and thro'
Mi&s;takes and Inconveniences then introduced (tho' not intended by the late
King) did, in tho&s;e calamitous Times, rather weakly than wilfully,
tran&s;gre&s;s their Bounds of Duty, and did not pay the Reverence and
Obedience to the fundamental Laws of the Land, which they &s;hould have done,
but were led by the wicked In&s;inuation of others, being confident that many,
from their Hearts, ab|horred every Article of that &s;trange and un|heard of
Rebellion, and mo&s;t heartily depreca|ted the Mi&s;eries that followed it; and
yet they them&s;elves contributed to it, and to tho&s;e very Votes from whence
tho&s;e Evils they abhorred did naturally &s;pring; not con&s;idering, that
when their Con&s;ultations tended to le&s;&s;en or infringe the Power and
Dignity of their King, they meddled with that which was not in their
Determination, and which the King ought to have maintained with the Sacrifice
of his Life: And we may well believe, tho&s;e Mi&s;eries could never have been
brought upon the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Na|tion, <PB N="212" REF="233"> nor that
Violence committed upon the &s;a|cred Per&s;on of his then Maje&s;ty, if
tho&s;e pro|fligated Villains that de&s;igned it, had not fir&s;t violated the
Parliament, by forcibly excluding tho&s;e Members, who would never have
con&s;en|ted to &s;o execrable an Attempt, &s;ince they had avowed and
covenanted for Defence and Safety of the King's Per&s;on, which was ever before
dear to Parliaments: And none can think of that horrid Act committed again&s;t
the precious Life of our Sovereign, but with Dete&s;tation, and &s;uch
Abhorrence, that Words are wanting to expre&s;s it. And had I the Voice of
<HI>Stentor,</HI> nay, of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> I could not &s;ufficiently
de|claim again&s;t it; and next to wi&s;hing it had never been, we wi&s;h it
may never be remem|bered, but with that Grief and Trouble of Mind it
de&s;erves, being the greate&s;t Reproach to our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation that
it ever yet incurred, tho' the Nation it &s;elf, as well as &s;everal Mem|bers
of Parliament were innocent of it, which was the only Contrivance and Act of
&s;ome ambitious blood-thir&s;ty Per&s;ons, hoping the di|vine Ju&s;tice will
not impute the Evil of it to the whole Kingdom, and involve the Guiltle&s;s
with the Guilty.</P>

<HEAD>MEMOIRS OF THE REIGN and GOVERNMENT OF K. <HI>CHARLES</HI>
the II^d^.</HEAD>
<P>_AFTER the deplorable Death of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. fitter
to be writ|ten in Tears of Blood than Ink, or rather to have a Veil drawn over
it, that it may never be re|membered, to the eternal Shame of the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, his Son, King <HI>Charles</HI> II. was crowned King
in <HI>Scotland</HI>; but it was up|on &s;uch hard Terms, that it was a
Que&s;tion, <PB N="216" REF="236"> whether the Crown was worth accepting.
How|ever, as the King's Affairs then &s;tood, it was judged be&s;t to accept of
it, preferring the em|pty Title of a King in his own Dominions, to the empty
Title of a King in another Nation. And yet it was thought &s;trange, that the
King would put him&s;elf into the Hands of that Na|tion, who&s;e Army had
treated his royal Father &s;o perfidiou&s;ly; the Selling and Delivering him to
the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> being the mo&s;t barbarous Action that any
People were ever guilty of; and their Honour can never be re|paired for the
Horridne&s;s of that mo&s;t wicked Crime. However, the late King
<HI>Charles</HI> could not be much blamed, in the &s;ad Po&s;ture of his
Affairs, for going to that Army, to which he was &s;o kindly invited, having
been ever a great Lover of that Nation, not only having been born there, but
educated by them; and there|fore thought he &s;hould find there his greate&s;t
Security, where he found the mo&s;t Danger. But indeed &s;uch &s;trange
Circum&s;tances contri|buted to his Ruine, that we might think Hea|ven and
Earth had con&s;pired again&s;t him, who was from the Beginning &s;o much
betrayed by his own Servants, that very few remained faith|ful to him; and yet
their Treachery proceeded rather from &s;ome particular Animo&s;ities among&s;t
them&s;elves, than from any trea&s;onable Intent to do the King Harm: And
notwith&s;tanding he was reduced to &s;o mi&s;erable a Fate, yet it is mo&s;t
certain he had as great a Share in the Hearts and Affections of his Subjects in
gene|ral, <PB N="217" REF="237"> and was as much beloved and e&s;teemed by
them, as any of his Predece&s;&s;ors: But it was our Wantonne&s;s under the
Happine&s;s we en|joyed beyond any other Nation, and our own Sins, which
brought that Judgment upon us. The &s;trange Tran&s;actions in
<HI>England,</HI> which began in the Year 1641, are not to be paral|lelled for
the wonderful Pa&s;&s;ages therein; we then &s;aw <HI>England,</HI> in the
highe&s;t Pitch of worldly Happine&s;s, fall to the lowe&s;t Degree of
Misfortune and Mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>I know very well, how un&s;earchable the Se|crets of Princes
are, in what an Aby&s;s they lye, and how much too deep to be &s;ounded by our
Di&s;cour&s;es; but when I remember the Turns of tho&s;e Times, I &s;eem rather
to dream, than to think the Relation true, of &s;o many &s;urpri|zing
Revolutions, which are &s;carce credible in this our Age. The be&s;t of Kings
was then condemned by mercile&s;s Rebels, after being abandoned by his
neare&s;t Friends, and pur&s;ued by his fierce&s;t Enemies, who furiou&s;ly
&s;eized upon his &s;acred Per&s;on, and at la&s;t took away his Life, and
triumphed in their own Wicked|ne&s;s with &s;ucce&s;sful In&s;olence for &s;ome
Years, when, at la&s;t, by God's Providence, the right|ful Heir to the Crown
was brought home to his own People, without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of any foreign
Prince, in as full Exerci&s;e of his Go|vernment, as any of his
Predece&s;&s;ors ever en|joyed, and by many of the &s;ame Men, who had before
been very active in the Mi&s;eries of the Kingdom, and De&s;truction of their
own <PB N="218" REF="238"> Country; and yet the Sufferings of the royal Family
were all recovered, by the concurring Hand of divine Providence. By which we
may &s;ee, when Subjects make Victories over their Princes, they are Triumphs
over them|&s;elves; and tho&s;e Men which will force Laws which they are bound
to pre&s;erve, will, in the End, find all their Victories full of Trou|bles,
bringing Ruine to their Authors.</P>
<P>But, leaving this Digre&s;&s;ion, let us &s;ee what is become of
our King in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who car|ried many eminent faithful Subjects with
him thither, who were nothing at all e&s;teemed by the <HI>Scots,</HI> who
cho&s;e a particular Council, by who&s;e Advice the King was to govern, who
gave the <HI>Scots</HI> great Satisfaction in all things they de&s;ired of him:
And, upon his being crowned in <HI>Scotland, Cromwell</HI> was declared
General, and prepared for a War, and marched with his Army, which he had before
modelled to his own Mind, commanded ab&s;olutely, di&s;|countenancing and
&s;uppre&s;&s;ing all who had been &s;upported by General <HI>Fairfax.</HI> The
Indepen|dants had all the Credit about <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and the Pulpits were
open to all that would &s;hew their Gifts, and great Di&s;traction and
Confu&s;ion in Religion then governed. The <HI>Scots</HI> rai&s;ed an Army
again&s;t <HI>Cromwell,</HI> &s;upplied with all things nece&s;&s;ary, but
Prudence, Courage, and Conduct. The King de&s;ired that he might command the
Army, &s;ince he was to run the Fortune of it; but the <HI>Scots</HI> would
&s;carce give him Leave to &s;ee it. <HI>Cromwell</HI> enters <HI>Scotland</HI>
<PB N="219" REF="239"> as far as <HI>Dunbar,</HI> but was &s;oon reduced to
great Di&s;tre&s;s, for want of all Nece&s;&s;aries. The <HI>Scots</HI> really
believed they had the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> at their Mercy; and it is certain, if
the <HI>Scots</HI> had only kept their Trenches, and &s;ent Parties of Hor&s;e
after the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> they would have marched off, and left their
Cannon and heavy Baggage behind: But <HI>Cromwell</HI> &s;eeing the
<HI>Scotch</HI> Army decamp, and follow him, he then made a Stand with his
Army, and the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;oon found they were not upon &s;o clear a
Cha&s;e as they imagined, being &s;o clearly defeated by <HI>Cromwell,</HI>
that he was that Night, being the Third of <HI>September,</HI> Ma&s;ter both of
<HI>Leith</HI> and <HI>Edinburgh.</HI> The <HI>Scots,</HI> like the
Anabapti&s;ts in <HI>Germany,</HI> pretended at fir&s;t nothing but Faith and
true Fear of God, and declared again&s;t Riches and Honours as Vanity; and upon
the great Opinion of their Humility and Devotion, they had procured much
E&s;teem; and after they had en&s;nared many with their Hypocri&s;y, they would
reform both Church and State: And having gotten Power, and enriched
them|&s;elves with the Spoils of <HI>England,</HI> they thought then to
ju&s;tify them&s;elves by our Saviour's Pro|mi&s;e, that <HI>The Meek &s;hould
inherit the Earth.</HI> When they fir&s;t entered <HI>England,</HI> their
Succe&s;s crowned their Work, and they were thought a wi&s;e and re&s;olute
Nation; for, after an unbloody War, for above one Year, they returned laden
with Spoils and great Riches, and were liberally rewarded, as well for going
out, as coining in|to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="240">It &s;eems the King, in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
was &s;o far from being in their late Battle at <HI>Dunbar,</HI> that he was
not admitted into their Councils or Ar|my: But to redeem their former Error,
they re&s;olved to rai&s;e a new Army, to be comman|ded by the King in
Per&s;on, hoping to pa&s;s ano|ther Way bye <HI>Cromwell</HI> into
<HI>England,</HI> intending to make the Seat of the War there, and made the
highe&s;t Profe&s;&s;ions of Duty to his Maje&s;ty, that could be invented, and
gave great Promi|&s;es to the King, of what Demon&s;trations of Zeal and Duty
they would &s;uddenly &s;hew him.</P>
<P>The King began his March, which was long and terrible, and
&s;everal Engagements pa&s;&s;ed in the Way, with different Succe&s;s, but
mo&s;t of them to the King's Di&s;advantage, who, in the End, arrived at
<HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> with his &s;hattered Army, and was there as clearly
defeated by <HI>Cromwell,</HI> the Third of <HI>September,</HI> as the
<HI>Scots</HI> were the Year before at <HI>Dunbar.</HI> The King's E&s;cape,
after the Lo&s;s of this Battle, was very miraculous, being pre&s;erved by a
wonderful Providence from the Fury of his blood-thir&s;ty Rebels. His Maje&s;ty
fir&s;t met in a Wood, not far from <HI>Bo&s;cobell,</HI> with Captain
<HI>Carele&s;s,</HI> who per&s;waded the King to get up into an Oaken Tree:
From thence he went into a Cottage, where he lay in a Barn, and was then
condu|cted to another Hou&s;e by Father <HI>Huddle&s;ton,</HI> who was &s;ent
to him by <HI>Carele&s;s,</HI> who after brought him to the Lord
<HI>Wilmot,</HI> who con|ducted the King to Mr. <HI>Lane</HI>'s Hou&s;e; from
whence the King rode before young Mrs. <HI>Lane,</HI> <PB N="221" REF="241"> to
her Cou&s;in <HI>Norton</HI> near <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> where the King was known
to the Butler. From thence the Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI> took the King into
<HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> to Collonel <HI>Gunter</HI>'s, and from thence brought the
King into <HI>Normandy,</HI> who had ever after a great E&s;teem for his
Lord&s;hip. There was in|deed &s;uch a Concurrence of Charity, good Na|ture and
Genero&s;ity, in Per&s;ons of the meane&s;t Extraction, and harde&s;t Fortune,
who knew the Delivery of the King would have been of great Advantage to them,
that we may look upon the King's E&s;cape as conducted by Hands of the
Almighty, who covered him as with a Shield, when his rebellious People &s;ought
his Life, who was &s;till concealed from their mo&s;t diligent Search, wherein
Father <HI>Huddle&s;ton</HI> was very in&s;trumental: And tho' many knew where
the King was, and tho&s;e very poor, yet none were tempted by great Rewards,
and more pow|erful Fears, to betray the King, who after ma|ny Changes of
Station, and Misfortunes, after this miraculous Manner, was brought into
<HI>France,</HI> and at la&s;t brought home to his own People: And tho' he was
forced away by a Whirlwind of Rebellion, he was re&s;tored to his Three
Kingdoms with the &s;till Voice of Peace and Mercy; a happy Pre&s;age how his
Maje&s;ty would govern, who&s;e Reign, at lea&s;t the Begin|ning of it,
&s;hewed &s;ufficiently his meek and ge|nerous Temper. In the time of the
King's Ba|ni&s;hment, he &s;pent two Years at <HI>Cologne,</HI> where he was
well received by a Widow, at who&s;e Hou&s;e he lodged. Before his going to
<HI>Cologne,</HI> <PB N="222" REF="242"> his Family was in great Di&s;order;
but at his being there, by Direction of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, his
Family was put under the Care and Management of Sir <HI>Stephen Fox,</HI> who
kept it in excellent Order. The King was then of a very merciful Nature, and at
that time it was very agreeable to his Inclination, not to have the Penal Laws
put in Execution; and tho' it was not in his Power to repeal them, yet it was
never in his Will to execute them; and his Maje&s;ty was then very forward to
do all he could for the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks in that kind: But when he
came into <HI>England,</HI> he &s;oon changed his Mind, and proved in the End
very &s;evere again&s;t the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks, who de&s;i|red to live
quietly, but could not be allowed to do &s;o.</P>
<P>Upon this King's mo&s;t happy Re&s;toration, there was &s;een
from all Parts his loyal Subjects contending how to expre&s;s their Gratitude
to Heaven, for its glorious Favour, and the King's no le&s;s than miraculous
Return, and for the manifold Ble&s;&s;ings they were like to enjoy un|der the
benign Reign of &s;o excellent a Prince, every Man &s;triving who &s;hould
fir&s;t pay the humble Oblation of their Duties, which really proceeded from
Hearts full of Reverence and Obedience to his &s;acred Per&s;on; being
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a deep Sen&s;e of the Honour and good For|tune they had
to be born his Subjects: And, indeed, who could forbear to be tran&s;ported
with Joy, that was going to receive his King? And who could contain the
Overflowings of his <PB N="223" REF="243"> Heart, when he could &s;ay, <HI>I
have my KING again?</HI></P>
<P>'Tis true, that when the Nation had been &s;o long mad, after
&s;o many Changes and Revolu|tions, and our Progre&s;s from bad to wor&s;e, we
might with Rea&s;on have expected, God &s;hould have &s;ent us the wor&s;t of
Tyrants, &s;ome Infi|del or U&s;urper, to &s;courge us with Whips, as we well
de&s;erved: But he was &s;o gracious as to &s;end us our own King, the
undoubted Heir to the Crown, to redeem our Nation from the In|famy it had
undergone, and to re&s;tore it to all it had lo&s;t, and to make the People as
happy as they ought to be. In order to which, the King gave a general Pardon to
all (excepting only &s;uch as &s;hould be excepted by Parliament) and that no
Per&s;on what&s;oever, for any Crime committed, either again&s;t his late royal
Father, or again&s;t the pre&s;ent King's &s;acred Per&s;on, &s;hould ever be
brought in Que&s;tion, to the lea&s;t Damage of Life, Liberty, or E&s;tate, or
even to the Prejudice of his Reputation, or any other Reproach or Term of
Di&s;tinction: And the King did then al&s;o declare a Liberty to tender
Con&s;ciences, and that none &s;hould be di&s;quie|ted, or called in Que&s;tion
for Difference of Opinion in Matters of Religion, which did not di&s;turb the
Peace or Settlement of the Kingdom. And further, to let his Subjects &s;ee how
to practi&s;e the Art of Forgetfulne&s;s, which they &s;hould learn from him,
his Maje&s;ty did then put &s;ome Men into eminent Employs, who had before
di&s;&s;erved him; &s;o that every Man might <PB N="224" REF="244"> capacitate
him&s;elf, by his future Behaviour, for any Place. But this Conduct &s;eemed to
&s;ome like a trimming Indifferency, to di&s;oblige his old Friends, in hopes
of getting new ones, which hath u&s;ually been the Subver&s;ion of
Go|vernments; and no wi&s;e Coun&s;ellour would ad|vi&s;e his Prince to grieve
his old Friends, to make his old Enemies rejoice. However, as the Po&s;ture of
the King's Affairs then &s;tood, he was obliged to take &s;uch Mea&s;ures; but
whether, at la&s;t, the King found his End in them, is yet a great Que&s;tion.
For, as the Judgments of God, have, in all Ages, reached tho&s;e at la&s;t, who
have &s;ecretly taken away the Lives of Princes, or have been in open
Rebel|lion again&s;t their lawful Kings, &s;o his Ju&s;tice did at la&s;t, in
<HI>England,</HI> become the Revenger of Blood, and pur&s;ued tho&s;e that
killed and took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, after they had boa&s;ted of their
Wickedne&s;s for &s;everal Years, and brought them at la&s;t to condign
Puni&s;hment, to let the World &s;ee and know, that Rebellion is criminal, even
when it is pro&s;perous; and tho' God may forbear for &s;ome time to puni&s;h,
yet he always does it ju&s;tly at la&s;t: For tho' God hath leaden Feet, and is
&s;low in puni&s;hing, yet he hath Iron Hands, and &s;trikes home in the End:
And here, that &s;ome Compen&s;ation might be made for the Lo&s;s of the Royal
Father, which was irreparable, God gave the Crown to his elde&s;t Son. It is
mo&s;t certain, that King <HI>Charles</HI> II. at his fir&s;t coming to the
Throne, had mo&s;t reconciling Thoughts, who gave large Evidence of them, 
<PB N="225" REF="245"> after &s;o high a Di&s;temper, and &s;uch a univer&s;al
&s;haking the Foundations of Government, de&s;i|ring and commanding his
Parliament to take Care to repair the Breaches, and to u&s;e &s;uch
Circum&s;pection and Indu&s;try, as might provide things nece&s;&s;ary for
&s;trengthening tho&s;e Repairs, and to prevent for the future whatever might
di&s;turb or weaken the common Intere&s;t; re|commending to his Parliament a
general Union, as the be&s;t, if not the only Way for their own Security, and
the Happine&s;s of the whole King|dom. This King, indeed, at his Re&s;toration,
was glorious in the Eyes of all his Subjects: Tho&s;e great Deliverances which
the divine Goodne&s;s had afforded to his royal Per&s;on from many imminent
Dangers, and the Support which it gave to his heroick princely Mind, under
&s;uch various Tryals, made it appear, that he was precious in God's Sight, and
as Gold out of the Fire: He was re&s;tored to his People and Patrimony with
more Splendor and Dignity, who had made a right U&s;e of his Afflictions, and
taken &s;uch Ob&s;ervations of other Countries, that he really intended to make
all his Subjects the better for what he had &s;een and &s;uffered abroad.</P>
<P>It is true, that, in the Beginning of this King's Reign, the
Doctrine of the Court was, <HI>Sow a little, that ye may reap much</HI>; and
tho&s;e who were then entru&s;ted with the Nation's Pur&s;e, were them&s;elves
for diving into the Prince's Pocket; and that too generous Prince, at his
fir&s;t coming to the Crown, was &s;oon over-per&s;waded <PB N="226" REF="246">
to give away the greate&s;t Part of his Crown Lands. The Courtier begged, and
the Citizen bought, and the King was &s;oon di|ve&s;ted of all; and yet they
who &s;uffered for his late royal Father, were not the better for all his
immoderate Bounties. The&s;e his great Li|beralities were not given as the
Recompence of ancient Merit, but were be&s;towed either as Re|wards of Vice, or
Price of Treachery; &s;o that the wor&s;t Men made the be&s;t Advantage: And
tho' the King did then what was very prejudi|cial to the Crown; yet &s;uch was
the flouri&s;hing Condition of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> at that time, that the
People could bear a great deal of ill Manage|ment: Be&s;ides, &s;ome were glad
to &s;ee a young King that would &s;oon be nece&s;&s;itated by his ex|travagant
Bounty to depend upon his People, who did then begin to apprehend, that the
King did meditate an arbitrary Power. Now, whatever Ground the great
Coun&s;ellours of tho&s;e Times had, there was no Bar put in the Way of that
de&s;tructive Bounty; but as ill|gotten Goods &s;eldom pro&s;per, very little
of what was obtained remained long in the Hands of the fir&s;t
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, but all was &s;oon di&s;per&s;ed into a Multitude of Hands,
and the Silence of tho&s;e who then had a Right to complain, &s;eemed in &s;ome
mea&s;ure to have ju&s;tified &s;uch Proceed|ings: And tho' the King, being
then young, airy and liberal, was much to blame for per|mitting &s;uch a Spoil
to be made of his Revenue; yet they (who&s;e Duty it was to take Care of the
Body Politick) &s;uffered the Di&s;temper to <PB N="227" REF="247"> proceed too
far; and what the King did was then winked at, becau&s;e the Courtiers (who
were neare&s;t the King's Per&s;on) got all, and and the great Trade and Wealth
of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> might bear &s;uch Gifts, which were not then
&s;upplied by new and heavy Taxes, which the People after found exce&s;&s;ive
in a following Reign. However, this great Over&s;ight of the King &s;hould
teach wi&s;e Princes to di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt tho&s;e that &s;erve them for
their own Ends, and tho&s;e that have only in their View the Intere&s;t and
Honour of the King their Ma|&s;ter: But we always &s;ee Compliance and
Flatte|ry get the better of Hone&s;ty and plain Dealing, Princes u&s;ually
loving tho&s;e be&s;t that di&s;pute not with them, and prefer them before
&s;uch as advi&s;e them really what is be&s;t for their Service. This kind of
Flattery is a Plant &s;o pre&s;erved in mo&s;t Courts, that it never fails of
bringing mo&s;t dangerous Fruit, and Princes very &s;eldom di&s;cover it, till
it be too late, and that they are ruined by it. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, it would be
a great Advantage to Princes, and to their Sub|jects a great Happine&s;s, to
have plain Truths delivered to them with Decency and Privacy, from their mo&s;t
faithful Servants, whereby they might redre&s;s many Mi&s;takes of their
Judg|ments or Will; which brings to my Mind what <HI>Tom Killigrew,</HI> a
Groom of the Bed-Chamber to King <HI>Charles</HI> II. &s;aid, as he was under
his Barber's Hands: A Book being in the Window, in which <HI>Killigrew</HI> was
looking, it being a Book of his own Plays, of which the King taking 
<PB N="228" REF="248"> Notice, he a&s;ked him, <HI>What Account he would give
at the Day of Judgment, of all the idle Words in that Book? Why truly,</HI>
&s;ays <HI>Killigrew, I &s;hall give a better Account of all the idle Words in
this Book, than your Maje&s;ty &s;hall do of all your idle Promi&s;es, and more
idle Patents, which have undone many; but my idle Words in this Book have
undone no Per&s;on.</HI> This was a bold and &s;harp Repartee; but the King
being an in|dulgent Ma&s;ter, and not of a Di&s;po&s;ition to do har&s;h
things, gave <HI>Killigrew</HI> a great Liberty of Fooling; for otherwi&s;e he
mu&s;t needs have ta|ken Notice of that bitter Reflection, which the King did
not: But if the Sub&s;tance of that Sar|ca&s;m had been told the King decently
and pri|vately, it might have had a good Operation; whereas what was &s;poken
was then taken for a Je&s;t only, and &s;o the King pa&s;&s;ed it by. Now if we
&s;eriou&s;ly reflect on the fir&s;t Twelve Years of this King's Government, we
&s;hall not find in the like Space of Time, either at home or abroad, &s;o
great Plenty of all things for the Delight of Mankind, nor find &s;o long a
Time free from Inju&s;tice and Oppre&s;&s;ion, where the King and Lords did
le&s;s oppre&s;s the Commons, and where there was &s;o great a
Conde&s;cen&s;ion to tender Con&s;ciences: And if it be true, that as <HI>Multa
funera &s;unt opprobria Medicorum,</HI> &s;o <HI>Multa &s;upplicia &s;unt
opprobria Principum</HI>; it mu&s;t be much for the Honour and Memory of this
King, that in his fir&s;t Twelve Years Go|vernment, there was not one Nobleman
put to Death, and &s;o few of all others at the A&s;&s;izes, 
<PB N="229" REF="249"> that the like was never known in the Memory of Man; and
yet impartial Ju&s;tice was executed every where. I heartily wi&s;h I could
have &s;aid the &s;ame to this King's Death, for then un|doubtedly he would
have been <HI>CHARLES the Good,</HI> tho' not <HI>CHARLES the Great.</HI></P>
<P>But alas! there now began to be a great Vi|ci&s;&s;itude of good
and bad Events, and a very un&s;ettled and various Management of publick
Affairs, and not with &s;uch a Steadine&s;s of Con|duct as the fre&s;h
Experience of our then late Misfortunes might have in&s;tructed tho&s;e with
Courage and Con&s;tancy that were entru&s;ted with them: But tho&s;e
Mini&s;ters that then &s;er|ved the King at the Helm of his Government, were
much to blame to &s;uffer &s;uch things, which were quickly reduced to a mo&s;t
unhappy Con|dition, betwixt the King and his ill-natured ob&s;tinate Subjects
then a&s;&s;embled in Parliament, that by his Maje&s;ty's conde&s;cending to
&s;ome things, which &s;eemed of little or no Con&s;e|quence when fir&s;t
yielded unto, yet they were afterwards made the Foundation of a great Battery
again&s;t the King's Authority, Reputa|tion, and Strength of his Government:
But it was our own Ingratitude under &s;o many great Advantages we then enjoyed
beyond other Peo|ple, which drew tho&s;e Judgments from Heaven upon us. I
confe&s;s, the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks who were peaceable and innocent,
&s;uffered at this time many grievous Per&s;ecutions, which were not only
permitted by the King, but his Par|liament was encouraged therein, tho' the
King <PB N="230" REF="250"> was not ignorant of their Innocence: Yet, to
Per&s;ons that knew tho&s;e Times, and how con|tinually the King was teazed by
tho&s;e ill-na|tured Gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Commons, it will be the le&s;s
Wonder, that &s;uch things &s;hould happen in the Days of &s;uch a Prince, who
had &s;o yielding a Nature as the King. 'Tis true, the great Per&s;ecutions
which the Chri&s;tians &s;uf|fered under the good Reign of <HI>Marcus Aurelius
Antoninus</HI> the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperor, were all impu|ted to him, how
ju&s;tly I cannot &s;ay; but our King did not only connive, but would often
rally at the Extravagance of the Hou&s;e of Commons: And yet this I may truly
&s;ay, that tho' he gave unlawful Permi&s;&s;ion to per&s;ecute the
<HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks, whom he knew to be innocent; yet he always &s;tood
firm to keep the Succe&s;&s;ion of his Crown in its due and lawful De&s;cent,
and would never yield to have it alte|red, tho' he was pre&s;&s;ed very
violently to it, by great Artifices, which made him often prorogue Parliaments,
and the King continued re&s;olute in this Point, even to his Death.</P>
<P>In <HI>June</HI> 1672, Mr. <HI>Borell</HI> the <HI>Holland</HI>
Mini|&s;ter, was with his Maje&s;ty, and de&s;ired the Ad|mi&s;&s;ion of four
Deputies from the States Gene|ral, to know what the King de&s;ired, and &s;aid
as many were appointed for <HI>France</HI>; but the King refu&s;ed their
Admi&s;&s;ion, and &s;aid, he would do nothing without the Participation of his
Allies: However, he would be &s;o generous as to do what he could that lay in
his Power, and then named the Lord <HI>Hallifax</HI> his Envoy 
<PB N="231" REF="251"> Extraordinary to the King of <HI>France,</HI> and would
&s;end him to confer with that King upon their Propo&s;als, and it was &s;aid
he &s;hould go thro' <HI>Holland,</HI> and take Sir <HI>Gabriel Sylvius</HI>
with him.</P>
<P>The Sixteenth of <HI>January</HI> following, the Duke of
<HI>Buckingham</HI> had the &s;ame Cen&s;ure from the Hou&s;e of Commons as the
Duke of <HI>Lauder|dale</HI> had, to be both bani&s;hed from the King's
Pre&s;ence for ever: Whereupon the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> de&s;ired to be
heard in the Hou&s;e of Commons, which was granted to him, and his Bu&s;ine&s;s
was to lay all the Blame upon the Earl of <HI>Arlington,</HI> who al&s;o
an&s;wered in the Hou&s;e, and behaved him&s;elf &s;o well, that he got
immortal Reputation, to be a Man of Abi|lity, Prudence, Conduct, and of great
Tem|per, and &s;o e&s;caped the Cen&s;ure of the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>About this time the <HI>Marquis de Fre&s;no,</HI>
Am|ba&s;&s;ador Extraordinary from <HI>Spain,</HI> pre&s;ented to the King a
very warm Memorial, menacing a War, unle&s;s the King would embrace a Peace
with <HI>Holland,</HI> upon the&s;e Three Points. The Fir&s;t was, The Flag to
Content, with Eight Hundred Thou&s;and Pattacoons, and the mutual Re&s;titution
of Places and Prizes taken in <HI>Eu|rope:</HI> To which his Maje&s;ty returned
this fol|lowing An&s;wer.</P>
<P>That, if they would add a Promi&s;e to regu|late the <HI>Ea&s;t
India</HI> Trade, give Liberty of De|parture to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> at
<HI>Surinam,</HI> and not to Fi&s;h on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Coa&s;t without
Permi&s;&s;ion; as to his Maje&s;ty, he would be content: But 
<PB N="232" REF="252"> that the Place of Treaty mu&s;t be <HI>Cologne,</HI> and
Re&s;pect paid to the Mediation of <HI>Sweden,</HI> which could not be avoided,
becau&s;e it was accepted by all: But becau&s;e his Maje&s;ty's An&s;wer to the

<P>THAT he was not a little &s;urprized to find the
Contents of this Paper confirmed to him the Report of a Treaty made betwixt the
King his Ma&s;ter and the <HI>States General of the United Provinces,</HI> the
A&s;&s;i&s;ting of whom in this War was a manife&s;t Breach of the &s;eparate
Article in the Treaty betwixt the two Kings, binding them reciprocally; not to
a&s;&s;i&s;t each other's Enemies in any open War: And his Maje&s;ty's Wonder
there|upon hath been the greater, that the Treaty with the <HI>States
General</HI> was never owned to him by the Amba&s;&s;ador him&s;elf, or by any
other <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ter; and that his Excellency was plea&s;ed to
look upon it (when the Rumour there|of came fir&s;t abroad) as a malicious
Invention of the Enemies of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> diffu&s;ed only to
create a Mi&s;under&s;tanding betwixt his Maje&s;ty and that Crown: Whereas now
it &s;eemed <PB N="233" REF="253"> to be a real Thing, and does no le&s;s,
according to the Tenor of the &s;aid Memorial, than threaten a War to his

by his de|clared Enemies: Notwith&s;tanding which, his Maje&s;ty e&s;teems
him&s;elf in &s;ome Degree beholden to the Catholick Queen, for having imparted
to him the Terms and Conditions upon which the <HI>States General of the United

at all times re|cede from them as they &s;hould &s;ee Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Now, altho' the Conditions offered in the &s;aid

Trea&s;ure that War hath co&s;t; yet, that the World may &s;ee how de&s;irous
his Maje&s;ty is to contribute to the general Peace of Chri&s;tendom, he

<P>Now, if the <HI>States General</HI> will extingui&s;h

<P><PB N="236" REF="256">Upon this Memorial, many Members of
Parliament had the States Generals Reply to his Maje&s;ty's An&s;wer to the
Memorial, &s;ent inclo&s;ed to them in Print, before the King had received the
Original. Sir <HI>William Coventry</HI> had four Copies &s;ent him in &s;everal
Pacquets, which he forthwith carried to the Lord Keeper, and his Lord&s;hip to
the King; by which may be &s;een what incongruous things the States Ge|neral
&s;uffered, who endeavoured to dethrone his Maje&s;ty, by their Appeal to his
People, without taking Notice of the King. The Ori|ginal of this Reply of the
States General was &s;ent to his Excellency the <HI>Marquis de Fre&s;no,</HI>
who thought it too &s;candalous for him to offer, and &s;ent it back to the
States with great In|dignation: But towards the End of <HI>January,</HI> his
Excellency pre&s;ented a Letter from the States General to the King, wherein
they granted Five of the Six Points in a full Manner, but they refu&s;ed any
Acknowledgment for the Fi&s;hing. The Ninth of <HI>February</HI> following, the
Peace betwixt <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> was Signed and Sealed by
the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, as Plenipo|tentiary for
<HI>Holland,</HI> and by &s;ix Privy-Coun|&s;ellours on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Side, <HI>viz.</HI> The Lord Keeper, the Lord High Trea&s;urer, Duke of
<HI>Monmouth,</HI> Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> with the two principal Secretaries
of State. The Scope of the Peace was as follows.</P>
<P>The Treaty of <HI>Bredah</HI> remains firm, the Ma|rine Treaty
confirmed for Nine Months, and that Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould pre&s;ently meet
to <PB N="237" REF="257"> regulate the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Trade, in which
Regu|lation <HI>Spain</HI> to be left the Umpire, as it is the Guaranty of the
whole Treaty; <HI>New-York</HI> to be re&s;tored; the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to
come from <HI>Surinam</HI>; Eight Hundred Thou&s;and Pattacoons to be paid in
the Time &s;pecified; the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships to &s;trike in the
<HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Seas, from Cape <HI>Fene&s;tre</HI> to the <HI>Naze</HI> in
<HI>Norway:</HI> An Article for hindering each from &s;uccouring the Enemies of
the other; but no mention is made of the Fi&s;hing, that remaining in the
&s;ame Condition it formerly was. <HI>France</HI> &s;eemed much di&s;plea&s;ed
at this Peace; but it was believed his Maje&s;ty of <HI>Eng|land</HI> would
interpo&s;e as Mediator, which was not what mo&s;t <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI>
de&s;ired, who would gladly &s;ee <HI>France</HI> reduced to the Treaty
<HI>Pyrrhe|nean.</HI> The Peace betwixt <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI>
being thus &s;ettled, the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador took Leave of his

Sir <HI>Richard Munden,</HI> and <HI>Don Emanuel de Lyra</HI> was named Envoy

the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador wrote from <HI>St. Andr&egrave;</HI> in

</LETTER>
<P>But before I go farther, I will give an Ac|count how I came to
the&s;e honourable Employ|ments on this Side the Sea.</P>
<P>Be plea&s;ed then to know, that, at the Lord
<HI>Wentworth</HI>'s Death, which happened a little before the Burning of
<HI>London,</HI> I was, by the King's Command &s;ignified to me by the Lord
<HI>Arlington,</HI> Principal Secretary of State, ap|pointed to take Care of
his Funeral, and the Manner of it was then pre&s;cribed me. His 
<PB N="239" REF="259"> Lord&s;hip was a Privy-Coun&s;ellour, Collonel of the
Fir&s;t Regiment of Foot Guards, and was before Major General of all the
Hor&s;e in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and General of the Hor&s;e in the We&s;t of
<HI>England,</HI> and, at his Death, was Gentleman of his Maje&s;ty's
Bed-chamber. When I had car|ried his Body in State, as the King commanded, to
<HI>Teddington</HI> in <HI>Bedford&s;hire,</HI> to be buried with his
Ance&s;tors, and that I returned to <HI>London,</HI> the Bills of the Charges
of the Funeral were brought to me, which I gave the Lord <HI>Arling|ton</HI>;
but Money being then very rare, and the King no very good Payma&s;ter, the
Merchants expected their Money from me; and the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI> having
received &s;ome Money from me, which was due to &s;ome Companies of the
Regiment, the Captains thereof complaining that their Companies were not paid,
the Matter was left to be adju&s;ted by the Duke of <HI>Albe|marle,</HI> who
was General. The Merchants be|ing very importunate for their Money, I thought
be&s;t to retire, and came to <HI>Bruges</HI> in <HI>Flanders,</HI> where many
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Officers coming daily, I was &s;oon di&s;covered, and taken
Pri&s;oner, and at fir&s;t was u&s;ed very hardly by the Jayler, who had Orders
to keep me in his own Apartments, to eat and drink with him, and that I
&s;hould have Ten Shillings <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> daily allowed me, for Diet,
Lodging, and all Nece&s;&s;aries, which &s;hould be paid before I was
relea&s;ed; and Sir <HI>Mark d'Ogniati</HI> (who was of <HI>Bruges</HI>) and at
that time Re&s;ident for the King of <HI>Spain</HI> at <HI>London,</HI> engaged
to &s;ee all punctually paid. <PB N="240" REF="260"> When my Circum&s;tances
were better known, I was u&s;ed very well; and it being then that the King of
<HI>France</HI> began his Preten&s;ions upon <HI>Flanders,</HI> in Right of the
<HI>Dauphin,</HI> and many <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Officers being then in
<HI>Bruges,</HI> I had every Day much Company, and knew all that pa&s;&s;ed in
the Army, of which I gave an Ac|count each Po&s;t to the Earl of
<HI>Arlington,</HI> who being then Principal Secretary of State, &s;hewed my
Letters to the King, who being plea&s;ed with them, a&s;ked the Lord
<HI>Arlington,</HI> who &s;ent tho&s;e Letters? who thereupon told his
Maje&s;ty, that he had them from me, who was then a Pri&s;oner in
<HI>Bruges:</HI> Whereupon the King pre&s;ently an|&s;wered, that he had &s;een
no Letters that plea|&s;ed him &s;o much, and that gave &s;o clear Ac|counts;
and that if I could give &s;uch Accounts in Pri&s;on, I &s;hould give much
better when out: And therefore the King bid his Lord&s;hip take Care, that I
&s;hould be forthwith relea&s;ed, and &s;ent over to him; tho' his Maje&s;ty
knew I was at that time reconciled, and made a <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick, by
Father <HI>John Cro&s;s,</HI> who was Pre|&s;ident at <HI>Douay,</HI> and at
that time Confe&s;&s;or to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nuns in the Prince's Hoffe at
<HI>Bru|ges.</HI> Upon this Intimation from the King, Sir <HI>Mark
d'Ogniati</HI> was de&s;ired by the Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> to write to
<HI>Bruges,</HI> what the Account came to for my Impri&s;onment, and all
Nece&s;&s;a|ries, and that all &s;hould be &s;uddenly paid; up|on which the
Jayler came to tell me the good News: But I told him I was very well where I
was, and being out of Danger, that I had a <PB N="241" REF="261"> very good
Allowance, and could no where live &s;o well, and that I would not &s;tir from
Pri&s;on, unle&s;s, after paying all the Charges, I might have Money to put me
in Equipage, and then I would willingly and faithfully &s;erve the King: That
from my Scituation in Pri&s;on I could &s;ee the Vanity and Hurry of the World,
where mi|&s;erable Men were daily di&s;tracting them&s;elves in weari&s;om
contentious Wars, about the Great|ne&s;s of an empty World; and I could look
&s;afely upon them, never intermeddling with the Actions of others, but &s;pend
my Thoughts in my own little Sphere, and lay down my Head in Peace, and &s;leep
&s;ecurely in the Bo&s;om of Providence. Within few Days after I had given this
Account, Money was &s;ent to pay all the Charges of the Pri&s;on, with One
Hundred Pounds <HI>Sterling</HI> to put me in good Equipage; the Return of
Money being then very high, and much to my Advantage, I received what Was
ordered, and was forthwith relea&s;ed from Pri&s;on.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as I was at Liberty, I went to the Earl of
<HI>Ca&s;tlehaven,</HI> and knowing he had a great Influence upon <HI>Don Pedro
de Ronquillos,</HI> who was Super-Intedant at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> I
de&s;ired he would &s;peak to <HI>Don Pedro</HI> in my Behalf, that I might be
Auditor to the <HI>Scotch</HI> Regiment of Foot; which Place was then vacant,
and the Regiment was National, commanded by Collo|nel <HI>Scot</HI> of
<HI>Tekelah,</HI> Kin&s;man to the Duke of <HI>Monmouth.</HI> Hereupon his
Lord&s;hip recommen|ded me to <HI>Don Pedro,</HI> who was plea&s;ed to 
<PB N="242" REF="262"> examine me, and finding me fit for the Employ|ment, gave
me his Certificate to the Con&s;table of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> who was then
Governour of the <HI>Spa|ni&s;h Netherlands,</HI> in Place of <HI>Marquis
Ca&s;tle Roderigo:</HI> But the Plague being then at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> the
Con&s;table &s;tayed at <HI>Malines,</HI> and, upon pretending much
Indi&s;po&s;ition of Health, de|&s;ired he might return into <HI>Spain.</HI>
However, he &s;ent the <HI>Marquis de Vela&s;co</HI> to compliment our King
upon his coming to the Government, who &s;ent Sir <HI>Edward-Spraig</HI> to
return his Compli|ment, and the Queen &s;ent Mr. <HI>Roper</HI> on her Part. So
&s;oon as the Plague cea&s;ed at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> the Con&s;table
returned thither, where I found a Way to &s;peak to him, and gave him <HI>Don
Pedro</HI>'s Certificate, with a <HI>Placet</HI> from my &s;elf, and had his
Excellency's Promi&s;e of Di&s;patch, which he performed the next Day, to the
great Admiration of all the <HI>Commis</HI> in the Secretary's Office, that I
being a Stranger could get my Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o &s;oon done, when many General
Officers of the Army had been waiting &s;ome Months without Di&s;patch. Thus I
pre&s;ently got the Auditor's Place, and had the Con&s;ta|ble's Patent for it;
and when the Con&s;table, upon his own importunate De&s;ire, returned for
<HI>Spain,</HI> I was then garri&s;oned in the <HI>Fauxburgs</HI> of
<HI>Ghent,</HI> and we had Orders not to beat any Drums, or to make the lea&s;t
Noi&s;e whil&s;t the Con&s;table pa&s;&s;ed in his Barque.</P>
<P>Upon the Con&s;table's going for <HI>Spain,</HI> the <HI>Count
de Monterrey,</HI> who was <HI>Ma&s;ter de Camp</HI> of a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
Regiment, was made Governour <PB N="243" REF="263"> <HI>pro Interim,</HI> and
was after confirmed Governour General of the <HI>Spani&s;h Netherlands,</HI>
where he continued &s;ix Years, and was the be&s;t Gover|nour I ever &s;aw in
them. He paid the Soldiers Ten Months in the Year, kept the Country in very
good Order, &s;o that there was no Fear of Robbery; but it co&s;t the Lives of
many Men, and I have &s;een Fifteen or Sixteen hanging to|gether upon the
Canal, betwixt <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> and <HI>Willibrook,</HI> for Robberies
committed there.</P>
<P>Not long after Count <HI>Monterrey</HI>'s coming to the
Government of <HI>Flanders,</HI> the Congre&s;s was appointed at
<HI>Cologne.</HI> The Plenipotentiaries for our King were Sir <HI>Leoline
Jenkins,</HI> Judge of our Admiralty, and Sir <HI>Jo&s;eph William&s;on,</HI>
from both which I received Letters to go to the <HI>Hague,</HI> to buy &s;ome
Hor&s;es and Coaches for them; and I was particularly recommended by them to
Mon&s;ieur <HI>Marine,</HI> Fir&s;t E&s;quire to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI>
to take his Opinion and Ad|vice in the Choice of them. I was to buy two Setts
of Eight Hor&s;es for each Coach, and the Coaches likewi&s;e, if I could get
them good and cheap: After which I was de&s;ired to meet them at
<HI>Antwerp,</HI> in their Way to the Congre&s;s, which I did according to
their Directions. At their coming to <HI>Antwerp,</HI> they &s;ent me to find
the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> and Sir <HI>William Lockart,</HI> who were then
with the King of <HI>France,</HI> at a Hou&s;e belonging to the King of
<HI>Spain,</HI> Three Miles from <HI>Bru&s;&s;els.</HI> I there found the
aforenamed Per&s;ons with the King, who was then marching to be&s;iege
<HI>Mae&s;tricht.</HI> <PB N="244" REF="264"> The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> was
made a Lieutenant General in the King's Army, and Sir <HI>William Lockhart</HI>
was our King's Amba&s;&s;ador with the <HI>French</HI> King. At my Return to
the Plenipo|tentiaries, I waited upon them to <HI>Cologne,</HI> and after came
back to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> where I was em|ployed &s;everal times by their
Excellencies, be|twixt <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Cologne,</HI> upon great
Occa&s;i|ons, and was ordered by them to hold a &s;trict Corre&s;pondence with
Mr. <HI>Neipho,</HI> who lived then at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> and was ordered to
&s;erve our Plenipotentiaries in all he could.</P>
<P>At this time I found the Count <HI>Monterrey</HI> was no Friend
to our Plenipotentiaries, nor indeed to our Ma&s;ter, or his Intere&s;t, in any
Ca&s;e, and was particularly a great Friend to the Capers at <HI>O&s;tend,</HI>
which Ne&s;t of Pyrates did much Hurt to our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants,
&s;eizing all <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Ships they could find trading with
<HI>France,</HI> tho' their Trade was freely allowed by the Treaty of 1667,
&s;olemnly ratified by both Crowns: But the Count <HI>Monterrey</HI> would not
allow that Treaty, becau&s;e he &s;aid it was never publi&s;hed in
<HI>Flanders,</HI> which was their own Fault, for the Ratification, not the
Publication, makes all Treaties effectual: And yet our King bore all the&s;e
Affronts with incredible Patience, expecting that the Count <HI>Monterrey</HI>
would bet|ter inform him&s;elf, both of the Matters of Fact, and of the Law;
for certainly the Articles of that Treaty were &s;o plain and clear in the
Point, that the Ca&s;e was adjudged, as &s;oon as compared with the Terms of
the Treaty; and the King <PB N="245" REF="265"> was &s;till in Hopes, that the
Count would be made &s;en&s;ible of the un&s;ufferable Affront, as well as the
Inju&s;tice of &s;uch Proceeding of the Privateers was to his Maje&s;ty, even
to &s;uch a Degree, that his Maje&s;ty was thinking of another Way to right his
Subjects, if &s;udden Reparation came not by fair Means.</P>
<P>Neither was the Count <HI>Monterrey</HI> only re|fractory in
this, but was highly di&s;plea&s;ed at my being employed by the
Plenipotentiaries at <HI>Cologne,</HI> and told Father <HI>Patrick</HI> (who
was then called Abbot of <HI>Thuly</HI>) that there was a little
<HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> (who&s;e Name he knew not) that was employed by the
Amba&s;&s;adors at <HI>Cologne,</HI> of which Father <HI>Patrick</HI> gave me
Notice, and &s;aid, that, by the De&s;cription, he was almo&s;t confi|dent that
his Excellency meant me: And the next Day, as I was going to Dinner, at the
<HI>Great Looking-Gla&s;s</HI> in the <HI>Berge Street,</HI> where I lodged, a
Servant told me, there was a Gen|tleman without that would &s;peak with me.
Whereupon I went out to him, and told him, I was ju&s;t going to Dinner. He
&s;aid, he was Adjutant to his Excellency, and that I mu&s;t pre&s;ently go
with him. Upon which I de&s;ired his Leave to go into my Chamber, to put on
another Peruke, and that a Coach &s;hould be made ready in the mean time, and
&s;o I would go with him. When I came to Court, I met Vi&s;count
<HI>Berlin</HI> (who was then Governour of <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI>) in the
Anti-Chamber, who told me his Excellency was in the next Room, and would
&s;peak a Word with me; and thereupon <PB N="246" REF="266"> led me in to his
Excellency, who a&s;ked me three or four Que&s;tions before I could an&s;wer
him one of them: As, what I did at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> why I went &s;o often
to <HI>Cologne</HI> and <HI>England?</HI> I told him, I was employed by the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Am|ba&s;&s;adors at <HI>Cologne,</HI> to receive and &s;end
their Letters; and that I &s;hould wait upon his Ex|cellency in few Days, to
get an <HI>E&s;corte</HI> to carry &s;ome things from <HI>England</HI> to the
Pleni|potentiaries. To which his Excellency replied, That if what I &s;aid was
true, <HI>Antwerp</HI> was a fitter Place for me than <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI>
and that he would not permit my longer Stay at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els.</HI> To which
I an&s;wered, That there being no open War declared between <HI>England</HI>
and <HI>Spain,</HI> and &s;o long as I obeyed the Laws of the Coun|try, it was
lawful for me to &s;tay: And be&s;ides, that I was indebted in my Lodging, and
could not go till I had &s;atisfied All. In fine, his Excellency told me,
the&s;e were only Excu&s;es which I made, and commanded Vi&s;count
<HI>Berlin,</HI> that the Adjutant &s;hould &s;ee me go out of Town that Night,
and that <HI>Antwerp</HI> was a much fitter Place for me than
<HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI>; and &s;o I left his Excellency, and went pre&s;ently to
Father <HI>Patrick,</HI> who lived near the Court, to inform him of what had
happened, and de&s;ired him to &s;end to Mr. <HI>Chaumont</HI> for my Letters,
and open them in my Ab&s;ence, and then &s;end them to me at Mr.
<HI>Neipho</HI>'s at <HI>Antwerp.</HI></P>
<P>The next Day the Letters came, and one from Sir <HI>Robert
Southwell</HI> to me, giving an Ac|count of the Peace &s;igned that Day in
Council, <PB N="247" REF="267"> he being then Clerk of the Council. He told me,
the Writings were &s;carce dry upon the Council Table; but however, he thought
ne|ce&s;&s;ary to give me a &s;peedy Account of it, for the Information of
others. Father <HI>Patrick</HI> carried this Letter in his Pocket late on
<HI>Satur|day</HI> Night, and &s;aid, he came to give his Ex|cellency Joy of
the Peace that was made in <HI>England.</HI> His Excellency an&s;wered, it was
true that the Peace was made, and that he was very angry with the <HI>Marquis
de Fre&s;no,</HI> who told him, he had been all that Day in Council, and was
&s;o weary, that he could not give him an Ac|count till the next Po&s;t, of all
the Particulars. Whereupon Father <HI>Patrick</HI> &s;aid, he would &s;hew him
all the Particulars, which his Excellency was very de&s;irous to &s;ee; and
having peru&s;ed them, he de&s;ired to know from whom he had them; and the
Father told him, that Sir <HI>Robert Southwell</HI> had &s;ent them to the
Gentleman he had &s;ent to <HI>Antwerp,</HI> who had given him Leave to open
his Letters in his Ab&s;ence, and to &s;end them to him. His Excellency
pre&s;ently &s;aid, <HI>I know Sir</HI> Robert Southwell <HI>to be a very
hone&s;t Man, and well inclined to us; and if the Gen|tleman I &s;ent to</HI>
Antwerp <HI>keeps a Corre&s;pondence with him, I believe he may be hone&s;t
al&s;o; and therefore I pray &s;end for him back, and let him bring his little
Hor&s;e with him, of whom I have heard great Miracles.</HI> On <HI>Monday</HI>
I came back, and his Excellency &s;ent for Mr. <HI>Chicati</HI> (who was
Ma&s;ter of the Academy at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI>) to ride the Hor&s;e round the
Park, and to give him an <PB N="248" REF="268"> Account of the Hor&s;e, who
gave &s;uch an Ac|count of him, that his Excellency would by all Means buy the
Hor&s;e of me. I told him, I could not &s;ell him; but if his Excellency would
plea&s;e to accept of him, with his <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Equipage, I would
pre&s;ent him; but he refu&s;ed to have him, unle&s;s he might buy him, and
&s;o I &s;aved my Hor&s;e and my Honour al&s;o. But I mu&s;t not forget to do
Father <HI>Patrick</HI> this Right, that upon his Excellency's commanding me
from <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> he forthwith wrote Word of it to the Lord
<HI>Arlington,</HI> and what Danger I did run, by being employed without a
Commi&s;&s;ion. But whil&s;t I was at <HI>Cologne,</HI> I received this Letter

<SALUTE>Good Mr. <HI>Bul&s;trode,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT hath been our great Unhappine&s;s, that Mr.

from Mr. <HI>Chud|leigh</HI> (Secretary to our Emba&s;&s;y) tho&s;e
Di&s;pat|ches which he had prepared for his Conveyance; &s;o that he will
appear to my Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> with his Hands in a manner empty. You are
therefore de&s;ired to follow him Day and Night with the Pacquet which Mr.
<HI>Chudleigh</HI> will deliver you, as fa&s;t as you can po&s;&s;ibly, till
you overtake him. It is of very great Importance to the Publick, and to us in
particular. You are not to &s;top, tho' you follow him to <HI>Whitehall;</HI>
and you are to put the Pacquet into his own Hands, without taking

arrived, and &s;hewed him&s;elf, and delivered his Letters, before you overtake
him, you are (having &s;hewed him this Letter from us) to leave it to his
Direction, to excu&s;e this Accident as well as he can, and then you are to
return hither, without taking any farther Notice of this Occa|&s;ion. We are,

</LETTER>
<P>Upon this emergent Occa&s;ion I got to <HI>Antwerp</HI> before
Mr. <HI>Frances,</HI> tho' he parted from <HI>Cologne</HI> in the Morning, and
I did not leave it till late in the Evening, and having &s;hewed him my Letter
from the Amba&s;&s;adors, and given him all his other Di&s;patches, I
ha&s;tened into <HI>Flan|ders,</HI> after I had taken a Turn into
<HI>Holland,</HI> and vi&s;ited all Places both by Land and Sea, and from
thence I made a &s;hort Step into <HI>Eng|land,</HI> to give the King an
Account of what I had &s;een, which I put into Writing &s;o fully to his
Maje&s;ty's Satisfaction, that he cau&s;ed my Relation to be entered into the
Council-Book; and having done this, I went to find my Brother <HI>Henry,</HI>
who was very private in <HI>London,</HI> after having had the Misfortune to
kill a <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> Gen|tleman, his Neighbour, in a Duel (tho' with all
the Fairne&s;s and Honour &s;o unfortunate an Accident is capable to have
&s;aid for it) and tho' wounded him&s;elf, yet he was &s;o &s;everely 
<PB N="250" REF="270"> pro&s;ecuted, that he mu&s;t leave <HI>England.</HI>
Upon which Occa&s;ion, after &s;erious Con&s;ideration of his Condition, I
moved my Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> pri|vately, to get his Maje&s;ty's Leave, that
my Brother might go over with me into <HI>Holland,</HI> and I would undertake
to place him where he &s;hould give his Lord&s;hip con&s;tant Accounts of what
pa&s;&s;ed in tho&s;e Parts worthy his Know|ledge, and that by his great
Diligence and In|du&s;try &s;hould merit his Maje&s;ty's Pardon, if not his
Grace and Favour. But, in order to this, I did beg his Lord&s;hip, that a
Letter might be written to the Ma&s;ter of the Pacquet-Boat at
<HI>Harwich,</HI> not to let the Boat go off with the Letters till my Arrival,
which &s;hould be with all Speed, and that none who came with me might be
que&s;tioned, but that we might freely embark: Which being granted to me, I
carried my Brother, where I placed him very well for his Maje&s;ty's Service,
which he &s;o punctually performed, that he did not only get the King's Pardon
under the Great Seal, but did his Ma|je&s;ty &s;uch farther Service, that he
was rewarded for it. From <HI>Holland</HI> I went into <HI>Flanders</HI> by the
Way of <HI>Sluys,</HI> and dined with Mon&s;ieur <HI>La Leok,</HI> the
Governour, who was Brother to Mon&s;ieur <HI>Odybe</HI> of <HI>Zealand.</HI>
From <HI>Flanders</HI> I want to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> where I was not many
Days before I received a Patent from the King, to be his Agent at the Court at
<HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> with a civil Letter to the Governour, the <HI>Count de
Monter|rey,</HI> telling him, that for &s;ome particular Rea&s;ons he had not
thought fit to &s;end me tho&s;e Powers <PB N="251" REF="271"> &s;ooner, which
were antedated &s;ome Months be|fore. Upon this I was very kindly received by
his Excellency, and from that time acknowledged for the King's Mini&s;ter, the
greate&s;t Cau&s;e of which, next to my Diligence in the King's Ser|vice, I
mu&s;t attribute to the Letter of Father <HI>Patrick</HI> to my Lord
<HI>Arlington,</HI> upon my being commanded from <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> by the
<HI>Count de Mon|terrey,</HI> and at that time acting without a
Com|mi&s;&s;ion. But I mu&s;t not forget, that, at my Return to
<HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> I did di&s;&s;wade Father <HI>Patrick</HI> from going
into <HI>England,</HI> which before he had re&s;olved to do, knowing it would
not only be very prejudicial to the King, but very di&s;advan|tageous to the
Lord <HI>Arlington,</HI> who at that time had many con&s;iderable Enemies, and
that no|thing was moved more &s;trongly again&s;t him, than Father
<HI>Patrick</HI>'s lodging at his Hou&s;e in the <HI>Park,</HI> of which my
Lord's Enemies made great U&s;e: But his Lord&s;hip was &s;o wi&s;e as to
change the Pen for the White Staff, had the Golden Key delivered to him, and
was declared Lord Chamberlain of his Maje&s;ty's Hou&s;hold, and Sir
<HI>Jo&s;eph William&s;on</HI> was forthwith decla|red, and &s;worn Secretary
of State in his Place, who &s;ent the &s;everal Letters of Complaint, of the
Violences committed upon our Merchants Ships, by the in&s;olent Capers of
<HI>O&s;tend,</HI> again&s;t whom we could never get any Ju&s;tice done,
du|ring the Government of the <HI>Count de Monterrey,</HI> who would not own
the Treaty of 1667, which was the Rule we were to go by, in all the Di&s;|putes
between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants and the <PB N="252" REF="272"> Capers,
which Treaty was &s;olemnly ratified by both Crowns. Whereupon I received the
fol|lowing Letter from Sir <HI>Jo&s;eph William&s;on,</HI> da|ted the 21&s;t of
<HI>September</HI> 1674, in the&s;e Words following.</P>

<SALUTE>Good Mr. <HI>Bul&s;trode,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is beyond Belief, to &s;ee with what intole|rable
In&s;olence the Capers of <HI>O&s;tend</HI> treat all the King's Subjects: The
Treaty of <HI>Madrid</HI> in 1667 mu&s;t be &s;tood upon, it being expre&s;s in
the Point; and till the <HI>Count de Monterrey</HI> can have Time to con&s;ider
and judge of it him&s;elf, 'tis but ju&s;t he &s;hould i&s;&s;ue out pre&s;ent
Orders to the Admiralty, not to proceed in any of tho&s;e Ca&s;es, till his
farther Order; and that is the Point you mu&s;t pre&s;s immediately at Court,
and get clear and full Proofs of all Wrongs, Injuries, and Threats done, or
given out by them, again&s;t any <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> and demand Satisfaction
of them, and at the &s;ame time certify them over hither, that if Ju&s;tice be
denied there, the King may plea&s;e to con&s;ider what he will farther do; and
continue to pre&s;s hard for &s;peedy Ju&s;tice in the Ca&s;e of all &s;eized
Ships and Goods, and to get the Treaty of 1667 owned as the &s;tand|ing Rule in
all tho&s;e Concerns; and be &s;ure to in&s;i&s;t, that it hath been allowed in
all Ca&s;es among&s;t us here in our Admiralty, as Sir <HI>Leoline
Jenkins,</HI> Judge of that Court, hath a&s;&s;ured me.</P>

<P>And the 14th of <HI>December</HI> following, I re|ceived this

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Good Mr. <HI>Bul&s;trode,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is &s;aid now, that our People them&s;elves, either out of
Ignorance or Malice, have given the <HI>O&s;tenders</HI> great Advantages in
&s;everal Ca&s;es, by confe&s;&s;ing their carrying double Bills of Lading, and
ca&s;ting Papers overboard, with &s;uch like indecent Practices, which in all
Times, and in all Countries, are reputed ju&s;t Cau&s;e of Condemnation, as was
practi&s;ed in <HI>England</HI> in the <HI>Dutch</HI> Wars. If this be &s;o,
they may thank them&s;elves if &s;uch Ca&s;es be given again&s;t them. But,
upon the whole Matter, the Proceedings of the Capers &s;hould be &s;traitly
watched, and upon what Grounds the Sentences are pretended to be given, that
&s;o the Matter may be received and judged on this Side. In the mean time, it
is manife&s;t, that the King omits nothing that he can po&s;&s;ibly and
lawfully do for his Subjects, who are very unju&s;t and ungrateful to his
Maje&s;ty, to lay any Part of the Blame upon the King or his Mini&s;ters, as I
hear &s;ome of them do. It is nece&s;&s;ary for you to have an exact Li&s;t of
all Ships at any time carried up by the <HI>O&s;tenders,</HI> and I pray try to
get one, with Affidavits of the mo&s;t notorious of the&s;e Capers, for we may
find a Way to meet with them, when they lea&s;t think of it. I have &s;ent you
an Exemplar of the Trea|ty of 1667, by which it will appear, how noto|riou&s;ly
their Proceedings are again&s;t the expre&s;s Words of the Treaty. What the
Secretary of his Excellency &s;ays, <HI>That the Way to prevent all Di&s;putes,
is to have a new Treaty made,</HI> is <PB N="254" REF="274"> true; but we
in&s;i&s;t to have the pre&s;ent Treaty executed: And if any Ca&s;es now
ari&s;e, where|in no Provi&s;ion is yet made, it may not be impro|per to
propo&s;e the having a Rule made for &s;uch Ca&s;es; but as far as the
pre&s;ent Treaty reaches, That is to be our &s;tanding Rule. And as for the
Ship with Plate on board, I &s;ee no Rea&s;on That &s;hould differ the Ca&s;e,
it coming from <HI>Tangier;</HI> and let the Goods be what they would (not
be|ing counterband) the Ship being <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> ought to free them: For,
by the Treaty, an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship is at Liberty to carry all Goods
(even to the Enemies of <HI>Spain,</HI> &s;o they be not counter|band) and
there is to be no Inquiry into her Lading, all being free, the Ship being
<HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>You are, for the future, to expect Mr. Secre|tary
<HI>Coventry</HI>'s Orders in all Matters from the King, becau&s;e you are now
in his Di&s;trict, he having prevailed with his Maje&s;ty, that
<HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> may be joined to his Province, being under the
<HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Government.</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Good Mr. <HI>Bul&s;trode,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Would lo&s;e no Time, upon the News of the <HI>Duc de Villa
Hermo&s;a</HI>'s being the a&s;&s;ured Succe&s;&s;or to <HI>Count de
Monterrey,</HI> to pay him my Compliments; and I beg, Sir, you will do me the
Favour to deliver the inclo&s;ed, with the Of|fers of my humble Service, as one
that has ever had a very particular Value and Honour for the 
<PB N="255" REF="275"> Per&s;on and Merit of the Duke, and in Confor|mity to
the Joy our Ma&s;ter hath at the Choice; a&s;&s;uring you, that the King hath a
very good Opinion of the Duke; and I hope the King of <HI>Spain</HI> his
Ma&s;ter may have Cau&s;e to be glad, by the good Effects it may produce during
his Go|vernment.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Mr. Secretary <HI>Coventry</HI> wrote to me, That denying the
Treaty of <HI>Flanders</HI> was of &s;o great Concern, having been &s;o long
&s;ince ratified, that I &s;hould inform my &s;elf of the <HI>Count de
Monterrey,</HI> before his Departure for <HI>Spain,</HI> whether he made any
Scruple of owning it; of which I gave Mr. Secretary an Account, that his
Excellency made Difficulty to acknow|ledge it. Whereupon Mr. Secretary
an&s;wered, That he never thought it would have been a Que&s;tion with the
Governour of <HI>Flanders,</HI> whether a Treaty of univer&s;al Extent, made,
&s;igned, and ratified at <HI>Madrid,</HI> &s;hould be com|plied with in
<HI>Flanders?</HI> For, if <HI>O&s;tend</HI> was in the King of
<HI>Spain</HI>'s Dominions, the Treaty reached it. Mr. Secretary, upon this,
&s;ent an Account to our Amba&s;&s;ador in <HI>Spain,</HI> not to in|treat an
Order, but to expo&s;tulate the Matter with that Crown, and the Secretary had
for An&s;wer, That they admired how his Excellen|cy &s;hould make a Que&s;tion
of ob&s;erving that Treaty, &s;o nationally ratified as it was: That then they
had &s;ent Orders upon it, which be|fore they could not have thought
nece&s;&s;ary. Count <HI>Monterrey</HI> did then, before his Departure, 
<PB N="256" REF="276"> &s;end a Letter to our King, to &s;end over Captain
<HI>Berthold</HI> (who was then Pri&s;oner in <HI>England</HI>) to be tryed in
<HI>Flanders</HI>; but his Maje&s;ty would not make &s;uch a Precedent
again&s;t him&s;elf, as not to vindicate his Flag's Right again&s;t any thing
that &s;hould affront it, when he finds them in his own Dominions, and would
give this An&s;wer to <HI>Baron de Bergeyk,</HI> whenever he &s;hould demand
it. In the mean time, that what he wrote, was only to inform me of the State of
the Thing, that if it &s;hould be di&s;|cour&s;ed by any of the Mini&s;ters, I
might be furni&s;hed with Rea&s;ons to defend the Proceed|ings of my Ma&s;ter,
but not as ordered &s;o to do, but as of my &s;elf: That the <HI>Count de
Mon|terrey</HI> was much mi&s;informed in the Matter, the Captain's refu&s;ing
to &s;trike being witne&s;&s;ed by the whole Sloop's Crew, both Officers and
Soldi|ers: That this was done with reproachful Terms, commanding our Captain to
&s;trike in the Name of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> (an In&s;olence never
com|mitted before, and again&s;t the Peace betwixt the two Crowns) and
pyratically forced away the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship, being under the King's
Flag, in our own Channel: That this being the Ca&s;e, and the Offender taken on
the King's Ground (the I&s;le of <HI>Wight</HI>) there could be no more
Que&s;tion of the King's Right to try this Man, than if he had come and robbed
in the <HI>Thames:</HI> That I might likewi&s;e &s;ay, that Captain
<HI>Berthold</HI> and his Comerades have been tryed by a Jury of Twelve Men,
Half of which (according to our Law) were Aliens, and found Guilty, and 
<PB N="257" REF="277"> have received their Sentence, and have humbly petitioned
the King, for a Relea&s;e of their Im|pri&s;onment, to which the King hath
con&s;ented, and hath given Order accordingly; and that the Matter of the Flag,
upon the In&s;ult offered to Mr. <HI>Porter,</HI> his Maje&s;ty's Envoy to the
<HI>Duc de Villa Hermo&s;a,</HI> which In&s;ult was before <HI>O&s;tend,</HI>
was laid by till the Arrival of <HI>Don Pedro de Ronquillos,</HI> who was daily
expected, his Goods being already come.</P>
<P>About this time I had a Letter from Sir <HI>Jo&s;eph
William&s;on,</HI> wherein he told me, he was &s;orry to hear of nothing but
Words in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of our Ships: That Provocations were rather daily
renewed, than any Satisfaction given, and even In&s;ults of a higher Nature:
That <HI>Don Franci&s;co Marco de Vela&s;co,</HI> Envoy from the <HI>Duc de
Villa Hermo&s;a</HI> to compliment the King upon his coming to the Government
of <HI>Flan|ders,</HI> had taken his Leave, and <HI>Don Pedro de
Ronquillos</HI> was daily expected as Envoy Ex|traordinary from <HI>Spain,</HI>
who had promi&s;ed to begin his Bu&s;ine&s;s with that of the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships carried up by the <HI>O&s;tenders</HI>; which was
become &s;o clamorous a Cau&s;e, that, without &s;ome &s;pee|dy Reparation, no
body knew what would fol|low. That indeed the In&s;olence of tho&s;e Ca|pers
was intolerable; and not only tho&s;e, but the <HI>Majorcans</HI> in the
<HI>Mediterranean,</HI> were grown in&s;upportable, by the Number of
Com|plaints brought daily to the King, for which he had commanded his
Amba&s;&s;ador at <HI>Madrid,</HI> to declare, that if &s;peedy and effectual
Repara|tion <PB N="258" REF="278"> were not made, his Maje&s;ty could not
lon|ger with&s;tand the thing, and that it would be impo&s;&s;ible to deny
Letters of Repri&s;al to &s;o many crying Ca&s;es of his Subjects that called
for them: That, it happening that the Yacht which carried Mr. <HI>Porter,</HI>
his Maje&s;ty's Envoy to return the Compliment of the <HI>Duc de Villa
Hermo&s;a,</HI> coming before <HI>O&s;tend,</HI> met with a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
Man of War, which, according to Cu&s;tom, he required to &s;trike, and for that
Purpo&s;e pierced his Rigging with &s;ome Shot; but the Man of War not only
finally refu&s;ed to &s;trike, but at la&s;t gave the Yacht one Gun with a
Bullet in it, which was re&s;ented as it ought to be, and put into a legal Way
of ex|amining fir&s;t, and would after be proceeded in according to the
ordinary Cu&s;tom of the Law, as a Crime of a high Mi&s;demeanor, and
con|&s;tantly puni&s;hed as &s;uch by the Laws of our Kingdom; but becau&s;e
<HI>Don Pedro de Ronquillos</HI> was &s;oon expected at <HI>London,</HI> this
Bu&s;ine&s;s would be deferred till his Arrival.</P>
<P>Being informed by a Per&s;on of Honour at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI>
that the <HI>Count de Monterrey</HI> would return into <HI>Spain</HI> by the
Way of <HI>France,</HI> be|cau&s;e his Excellency thought his Pre&s;ence would
not be acceptable to our King, I did thereupon acquaint Mr. Secretary
<HI>Coventry</HI> with it, who told me, That having acquainted the King with
what I wrote, his Maje&s;ty was much &s;urprized, not knowing the Cau&s;e for
&s;uch a Jealou&s;y: That it was true, the daily Complaints made by his
Subjects, of the ill Treatments they received <PB N="259" REF="279"> from
<HI>O&s;tend,</HI> and the &s;mall or no Satisfaction that he had received,
notwith&s;tanding the re|iterated Letters of his Maje&s;ty, did much
di&s;|plea&s;e him: But, as to the Per&s;on of his Ex|cellency, the King had no
particular Di&s;&s;atisfa|ction; but, on the contrary, if his Excellency
plea&s;ed to &s;ee <HI>England</HI> in his Return, he needed no way doubt of
receiving Re&s;pects &s;uitable to his Quality, and high Employment he had in
<HI>Flanders.</HI> However, the <HI>Count de Monterrey</HI> did not think fit
to pa&s;s thro' <HI>England</HI> in his Return, but went thro'
<HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>September</HI> following, the King wrote a Letter to the
<HI>Duc de Villa Hermo&s;a,</HI> which was &s;ent to me from
<HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> to be delivered, which being faithfully tran&s;lated from
the <HI>French,</HI> runs thus in <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>

<P>I Have a great Regret to write to you upon the Complaints of

Commerce and Navigation coming from the Ports under Obedience of his Catholick

by two Privateers of <HI>O&s;tend</HI> (the one commanding a Frigat of Twelve
Guns, with Two Hundred Men, the other of Six Guns, with One Hundred Men)
offered to me as well as my Subjects. A &s;mall Ship carrying my Colours, and

the &s;aid two Priva|teers, about the Height of my I&s;land of
<HI>Guern&s;ey,</HI> <PB N="260" REF="280"> gave them u&s;ual Notice to
&s;trike, which they did not only refu&s;e, but by an unheard of In&s;olence,
commanded my Ship to &s;trike to them, and to compleat their Outrage, took the
&s;aid Merchant, and carried it to <HI>O&s;tend.</HI> You may well judge, that
this Proceeding is not agreeable to Friends and Allies: And therefore having
repre&s;ented it to you, I believe you will give your Orders for the

<SALUTE>Good Mr. <HI>Bul&s;trode,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO morrow the Earls of <HI>Arlington</HI> and
<HI>O&s;&s;ory</HI> are to embark for the <HI>Hague.</HI> The Suddenne&s;s of
the Journey gives great Jealou|&s;y of a Treaty of Peace, of which there is
no|thing, that remaining wholly under the Conduct of Sir <HI>William
Temple;</HI> and they have no Cha|racter <PB N="261" REF="281"> but their own
Titles, and are purely &s;ent to the Prince of <HI>Orange.</HI> The Merchants
who have Intere&s;t in the Ship St. <HI>George</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> have
made their Complaints to the King and Council, and his Maje&s;ty is re&s;olved
to &s;peak roundly about it to the <HI>Baron de Bergeyk,</HI> when he comes:
But in the mean time it will &s;urely be very proper for the Merchants
concerned, that by your Interce&s;&s;ion they &s;hould have true Copies of the
Proofs and Rea&s;on of the Judgment, which cannot in Rea&s;on be denied them,
which I will &s;end to the Judge of our Admiralty; and if there be real
Exceptions in Point of Law, Matter of Fact being &s;tated on both Sides, our
Bu&s;ine&s;s will go on much more formally, and the King make his Complaints
upon a more &s;o|lid Ground, than the bare Allegation of the Merchants
intere&s;&s;ed, upon who&s;e Complaint the Council would advi&s;e nothing
po&s;itive, tho' they were very &s;en&s;ible of the Inju&s;tice. In the
<HI>Inte|rim</HI> I am commanded by his Maje&s;ty, that you &s;hould exhibite
the State of the Ca&s;e to the Mi|ni&s;ters at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> and
demand in his Maje&s;ty's Name, that either the Fact be avowed or el&s;e
di&s;proved, by letting you &s;ee the authentick Do|cument of the Court; and
the King will, upon a true State of the Matter, con&s;ider how to redre&s;s

<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Very much approve of what my Lord <HI>Mordaunt</HI> and you
told me you were about, and &s;hould, if I had been in Town, readily have
joined with you, and, upon the lea&s;t Notice have come up; for it's certainly
all our Duties, and particularly mine, who have borne &s;uch Offices under the 
<PB N="265" REF="285"> Crown, to improve any Opportunity of a good
Corre&s;pondence and Under&s;tanding between the Royal Family and the People;
and to leave it impo&s;&s;ible for the King to apprehend, that we &s;tand upon
any other Terms that are not as good for him, as nece&s;&s;ary for us: Neither
can we fear to be accounted Undertakers at the next Meeting of Parliament; for
I hope it &s;hall never be thought unfit for any Number of Lords to give the
King privately their Opinion, when a&s;ked, which in former Days, thro' all the
Northern Kingdoms, nothing of great Moment was acted by their Kings, without
the Advice of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable and active Nobility, that were within
Di&s;tance, tho' they were not of the ordinary Privy-Council; &s;uch
Occa&s;ions being not always of that Nature as did require the A&s;&s;embling
the great Council, or Parliament. Be&s;ides, there are none &s;o likely as us,
nor Time &s;o proper as now, to give the only Advice I know truly &s;erviceable
to the King, affectionate to the Duke, and &s;ecure to the Country (which is a
new Parliament) which I do undertake at any time to convince your Lord&s;hip,
is the clear Intere&s;t of all them. But, in the mean time, I mu&s;t beg yours
and my Lord <HI>Mordaunt</HI>'s Pardon, that I come not up as I intended, for I
hear from all Quarters, of Letters from <HI>Whitehall,</HI> that do give
Notice, that I am coming up to Town, that a great Office with a &s;trange Name
is preparing for me, and &s;uch like. I am a&s;hamed I was thought &s;o ea&s;y
a Fool by tho&s;e who &s;hould know me better: But I a&s;&s;ure your
Lord&s;hip, there's no Place or Con|dition <PB N="266" REF="286"> will invite
me to Court, during this Par|liament, nor until I &s;ee the King thinketh
fre|quent Parliaments as much his Intere&s;t, as they are the People's Right:
For until then, I can neither &s;erve the King as I could, nor think a great
Place &s;afe enough for a &s;econd Adventure. When our great Men have tried a
little longer, they will be of my Mind; in the mean time, no kind of U&s;age
&s;hall put me out of that Duty and Re&s;pect I owe to the King and Duke: But I
think it would not be ami&s;s, for the Men that are in great Offices, who are
at Ea&s;e, and where they would be, to be ordinarily civil to a Man in my
Condition, &s;ince, they may be a&s;&s;ured, that all their great Places put
together &s;hall not buy me from my Principles. My Lord, I be&s;eech you to
impart this to the Earl of <HI>Sali&s;bury,</HI> my Lord of
<HI>Falconbridge,</HI> and my Lord <HI>Hollis;</HI> and when you four command
me up, I will obey. I am &s;orry my Lord <HI>Hallifax</HI> had no better
Succe&s;s in his Summer's Negotiation, and that his Uncle Sir <HI>William</HI>
could make no nearer Approach to the Mini&s;ters of State, than the Ki&s;&s;ing
of the King's Hand: I fear it is fatal to his Lord&s;hip to go &s;o far, and no
farther. My Dear Lord,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>In <HI>June</HI> 1675, the two Hou&s;es were in a great Heat
with each other; whereupon, the Ninth of that Month, the Black Rod knocked at
the Door of the Hou&s;e of Commons, and &s;aid, the King commanded them to wait
upon him pre&s;ently in the Hou&s;e of Lords. The King then told them, That he
had called them <PB N="270" REF="290"> together, to &s;ecure their Religion and
Proper|ties, which he hoped they would have done &s;ucce&s;sfully, &s;eeing he
had not offered any Bu|&s;ine&s;s of his own to hinder or ob&s;truct it, and
had let them &s;it longer than he intended at fir&s;t: That he de&s;igned only
to have adjourned them for a &s;hort Time; but finding &s;ome of his and their
Enemies had been able to make Differen|ces between them, which could not be
accom|modated by any thing le&s;s than a Prorogation, he very unwillingly
prorogued them to the 13th of <HI>October,</HI> when he hoped to meet them
again in a better Temper, without &s;pringing new Differences, or reviving the
old. The Members then po&s;ted down into their &s;everal Countries,
di&s;&s;atisfied enough, but with whom, or with what, they could not tell. They
all agreed, the King did no more than Nece&s;&s;ity required him to do, and
&s;ome believed he had not done &s;o much as he ought to have done, or mu&s;t
quickly do; for, that a Prorogation was not likely to do the Bu&s;ine&s;s, but
that the Par|liament mu&s;t be di&s;&s;olved, for that no Good could be
expected from them, and that it was lo&s;t Labour to try them longer. After
this Prorogation, the Marque&s;s of <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> and the Earl of
<HI>Shaftsbury</HI> appeared at Court, which was done by Permi&s;&s;ion; for
the King being a&s;ked, if he would not take it ill, if they came, his
Maje&s;ty's An&s;wer was, That he forbid no Body, without any farther
Encouragement. It &s;eems the Two before-mentioned went likewi&s;e to St.
<HI>James</HI>'s, and were at the Duke's Ri&s;ing, <PB N="271" REF="291"> and
were received very kindly by his Royal Highne&s;s, which gave new Occa&s;ion of
Talk, and that the latter of them two would come &s;oon into Play. The
Parliament being again farther prorogued, and afterwards a&s;&s;embling, the
Lords were very hot upon the Point of the Legality of that Parliament; and tho'
tho&s;e that oppo&s;ed were &s;o few, that it was not worth being put to the
Que&s;tion, yet it la&s;ted a long Debate, and when the Debate was over, it was
moved, that tho&s;e who fir&s;t &s;tirred the Scruple &s;hould be puni&s;hed;
and then how many &s;hould be accounted liable? Whether the Duke of
<HI>Buckingham,</HI> who fir&s;t moved it, or others with him? And how many,
and who? Upon which three others were named, <HI>viz.</HI> the Earls of
<HI>Salisbury</HI> and <HI>Shaftsbury,</HI> and Lord <HI>Wharton:</HI> And a
Debate aro&s;e, whether tho&s;e Lords &s;hould withdraw as criminal, till their
Puni&s;hment was agreed upon? The Que&s;tion being put, Whether the offending
Lords &s;hould withdraw? it was carried in the Affirmative. Then the Hou&s;e
called for the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> who was gone; upon which it was
ordered, that the Black Rod &s;hould take his Grace into Cu&s;tody, and bring
him to the Hou&s;e the next Day. Then the other Three were called, and
requi|red to a&s;k Pardon of the King and the Hou&s;e, which they refu&s;ed,
and were thereupon &s;ent Pri&s;oners to the <HI>Tower.</HI> The Duke of
<HI>Buck|ingham</HI> appeared the next Day, and was &s;ent Pri&s;oner to the
<HI>Tower,</HI> becau&s;e he refu&s;ed like|wi&s;e to make the
Acknowledgment.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="292"><HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the 29th of
<HI>February,</HI> the Peti|tion of the Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> was read in
the Hou&s;e, &s;ubmitting to what the Lords &s;hould enjoin him, in begging
Pardon of the King and their Lord&s;hips. Whereupon the Lord Chan|cellor told
the Hou&s;e, That the King had al&s;o received a Petition from the &s;aid Earl;
but un|der&s;tanding, that he endeavoured to free him|&s;elf from their
Cen&s;ure, by an Appeal to the King's Bench, during the Adjournment of
Par|liament, his Maje&s;ty thought not fit to declare his Plea&s;ure, as to his
Enlargement, till the Hou&s;e of Lords had taken the Ca&s;e into their
Con&s;ideration. Upon which, after a long De|bate, it was ordered, That the
Records of the King's Bench Court &s;hould be brought into the Hou&s;e, and the
Earl's Bu&s;ine&s;s proceeded upon the next Day; when the Lords declared, That
it was a Breach of Privilege for any of their Hou&s;e to appeal to an inferior
Court, during the Sitting of Parliament: That however, this &s;hould not be any
Bar to any Plea the Earl &s;hould make. However, it &s;eems that, &s;ome Time
after, the Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> moved again by his Council in the King's
Bench, for ano|ther <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI>; upon which his Lord&s;hip was
brought thither, and the Bu&s;ine&s;s was agreed by Council on both Sides, and
the Judges de|clared, that his Lord&s;hip being committed by a &s;uperior
Court, <HI>viz.</HI> the Hou&s;e of Lords, of which his Lord&s;hip was a
Member, they could not enquire into the Legality or Illegality of his
Commitment, nor could they give him any <PB N="273" REF="293"> Relief, and &s;o
remanded his Lord&s;hip back to the <HI>Tower.</HI> Upon this the Earl
petitioned the Hou&s;e of Lords, to know whether he &s;hould be relea&s;ed or
not? To which the Lords told him, con&s;idering he had added a new Offence to
that for which he was committed, much more heinous than the fir&s;t, in
applying him&s;elf to the King's Bench with a new <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> which
was a farther Contempt of the Authority of the Hou&s;e of Lords, they would not
relea&s;e him. To which his Lord&s;hip an&s;wered, That the Crime for which he
was committed, was the only Matter in Que&s;tion before them; and there|fore,
if they looked upon his Submi&s;&s;ion as Satisfaction enough for the Fault he
had com|mitted, he might be allowed by the Hou&s;e to make his Application to
the King, for his Liber|ty; but, after a long Debate, it was carried in the
Negative, That he &s;hould not be allowed by the Hou&s;e to make his
Application to the King, and that they were re&s;olved not to relea&s;e him,
till they had examined all his Faults together. Then the Lords re&s;olved to
have the Earl once more before them, and having peru&s;ed the Record of his
&s;econd <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> they agreed, that his applying again to an
inferior Court, in the time of an Adjournment, which is a virtual Se&s;&s;ion
of Parliament, to be relieved again&s;t the Judgment of the Hou&s;e of Lords,
was a Breach of their Privileges, and re&s;olved, That he &s;hould an&s;wer the
Crime at the Bar of their Hou&s;e, the next Day; but the other Crime, far which
he was committed, &s;eemed to be for|given. <PB N="274" REF="294"> In the End,
the Earl finding his Peti|tion to the Lords rejected there, for want of having
behaved him&s;elf with due Submi&s;&s;ion and Obedience to the King, did then
again pe|tition his Maje&s;ty; but either uncarefully, or too capriciou&s;ly
in&s;inuated in his Petition, that he did it by Order of the Hou&s;e of Lords,
which the King took ill, and refu&s;ed the Petition upon it. After this, the
Lords were again upon this Bu&s;ine&s;s, and after many refined Que&s;tions,
the whole Matter hung upon &s;ome Words which were alledged his Lord&s;hip
&s;hould have &s;aid at the King's Bench Bar, upon his bringing his la&s;t
<HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> and that the Words then &s;poken by his Lord&s;hip were
derogatory to the Hou&s;e of Lords, and to their Power: Whereupon
Wit|ne&s;&s;es were called in and heard, who proved &s;o little to the Earl's
Di&s;advantage, that he was at length called for, to make his Submi&s;&s;ion to
the Hou&s;e, which his Lord&s;hip did with all the Words and Ceremonies exacted
of him, &s;o much to the Satisfaction of the Hou&s;e, that they or|dered an
Addre&s;s to be made to the King, to &s;ignify to his Maje&s;ty, that they (the
Hou&s;e of Lords) were entirely &s;atisfied, and that the whole Bu&s;ine&s;s of
his Lord&s;hip's Enlargement, or farther Confinement, re&s;ted with his
Maje|&s;ty: Upon which his Lord&s;hip was that Night remanded to the
<HI>Tower.</HI> The next Morning, the White Staves of the Lords Hou&s;e, in the
Name of the whole Hou&s;e, made an Addre&s;s to his Maje&s;ty, in the Ca&s;e of
the Earl of <HI>Shafts|bury</HI>; and the Lord Trea&s;urer, the Morning 
<PB N="275" REF="295"> following, made Report to the Hou&s;e, that his
Maje&s;ty was &s;atisfied, and that he would gra|ciou&s;ly plea&s;e to order,
that the &s;aid Earl &s;hould be delivered from the <HI>Tower,</HI> which was
done accordingly; and the next Day the Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> had his
Liberty, and took his Place in the Hou&s;e of Lords.</P>
<P>About this time I received a Letter from the King to the <HI>Duc
de Villa Hermo&s;a,</HI> brought me from <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> by Mr.
<HI>Puckle,</HI> who was then employed by the Merchants. That it being long
&s;ince the Merchants fir&s;t applied them|&s;elves to his Maje&s;ty for
Redre&s;s in <HI>Flanders,</HI> and the King having long expected, from the
Interpo&s;ition of him&s;elf in that Affair, and the &s;everal Memorials given
in his Name to the Mi|ni&s;ters of <HI>Spain,</HI> from time to time
re&s;iding, as al&s;o by his Mini&s;ter at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> that his
Sub|jects would &s;ooner have found the good Effects of their In&s;tances; but
e&s;pecially being &s;o &s;eri|ou&s;ly promi&s;ed, upon the coming of their
De|puties, with <HI>Sieur Decio</HI> their Fi&s;cal, all Dif|ferences would be
&s;peedily adju&s;ted: Yet, to his great Di&s;&s;atisfaction he found, that
&s;everal Months had been taken up by them in Confe|rences, and yet the Affair
appeared &s;o far from being ended, that it &s;eemed to be indu&s;triou&s;ly
protracted: And his Subjects therefore fre&s;hly importuning him with
reiterated Complaints of their Oppre&s;&s;ions, and imploring that he would
provide for their Satisfaction, by &s;uch Ways as were agreeable to his royal
Dignity: His Maje|&s;ty therefore calling to Mind with what Pa|tience

having u&s;ed all amicable Ways depending upon him, was now con&s;trained to
let his Excellency know, That if Ju&s;tice were not &s;peedily admini&s;tred to
his Subjects, he &s;hould be obliged by the Protection he owes them, to give
them Leave to take their Satisfaction, by &s;uch Ways as the Law of Nations,
and his Treaty of 1667 with the King of <HI>Spain</HI> allowed. And therefore
the King &s;eriou&s;ly de&s;ired his Ex|cellency to give effectual Orders to

Maje&s;ty's Subjects, by the Privateers of <HI>O&s;tend,</HI> might be adjudged
and re|&s;tored to them, or their Value; that thereby the Nece&s;&s;ity of
having Recour&s;e to &s;everer Remedies might be prevented, which his Maje&s;ty

pre&s;erve a good Friend&s;hip and Corre|&s;pondence betwixt the two Crowns.
'Tis true indeed we had better Orders from the Duke, than we had formerly from
the Count <HI>Monter|rey</HI>; but the Difference was, that the <HI>Count de

<P>THE De&s;ire I have always had, and have, to do and perform
all things on my Part, that may effectually conduce to the con&s;tant
maintaining of a perfect Amity between me and my good Brother the Catholick
King; and the Care which you have al&s;o u&s;ed on your Part, to the &s;ame
good Purpo&s;e, ever &s;ince you came to the Government of <HI>Flanders,</HI>
made me believe, that my Subjects might have exerci&s;ed their Commerce and
Navigation, without any Hinde|rance or Interruption from tho&s;e of his
Catholick Maje&s;ty; and the rather, becau&s;e you once &s;ent the Sieur
<HI>Decio,</HI> Fi&s;cal of <HI>O&s;tend,</HI> hither into <HI>England,</HI> to
adju&s;t &s;uch Matters as were then in Difference, and to prevent the like for
the future: Notwith&s;tanding which, I am informed, that a Difficulty is
rai&s;ed concerning the Liberty of Trade to my Subjects, from one Port to
another, of &s;uch Countries as are in Enmity with <HI>Spain,</HI> but in Peace
and Amity with <HI>England,</HI> tho' there be not the lea&s;t Ground or Shadow
of any &s;uch Exception between me and his Catholick Maje&s;ty, nor is the like
practi&s;ed or pretended by any other Nation in Amity with me. Yet the
Admiralty of <HI>O&s;tend</HI> refu&s;eth to allow my Subjects that Liberty,
upon a Pretence that the &s;aid Fi&s;cal, when he was lately here, had given
undeniable Arguments in that Behalf: But I am well infor|med, that, when the
&s;aid Fi&s;cal was here, and pre&s;ented this Objection with &s;ome others
again&s;t the Liberty of Trade, Sir <HI>Leoline Jenkins,</HI> Judge 
<PB N="278" REF="298"> of my Admiralty, and Sir <HI>Robert Southwell,</HI>
Knights, being appointed to examine the Fi&s;cal's Papers, did make An&s;wer
thereto in Writing, in the Month of <HI>July</HI> 1675, and in particular to
that very Point, touching the Right of Freedom in Trade from one Port to
another; and that never any An&s;wer or Reply being made thereunto, it was
believed that the &s;aid Fi&s;cal, and all tho&s;e concerned in that
Que&s;tion, had finally acquie&s;|ced therein. A Copy of the An&s;wer made by
the &s;aid two Knights to the Fi&s;cal's Objection, I have cau&s;ed to be

<P>About this time Letters from the <HI>Hague</HI> told us, that
the States General and their Confede|rates had accepted of <HI>Nimmeguen</HI>
for the Place <PB N="279" REF="299"> of Treaty, at the Mediation and
Recommen|dation of his Maje&s;ty of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> which was forthwith
communicated to <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Ravigni,</HI> the <HI>French</HI>
Amba&s;&s;ador, who told our King, that his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty would
not &s;end his Amba&s;&s;adors, till the Emperor had agreed to &s;ome
Accommodation upon the two preliminary Points, of Prince <HI>William</HI> of
<HI>Fur|&s;tenberg,</HI> and the Money belonging to the <HI>French</HI> King
&s;eized at <HI>Cologne.</HI> Hereupon our King &s;ent to his Amba&s;&s;ador at
the <HI>Hague,</HI> to pre&s;s the States in that Matter, who an&s;wered, That
they did not think fit to meddle in that Matter, but left it entirely to the
Emperor's Plea&s;ure, who&s;e Mini&s;ter at the <HI>Hague</HI> declared in the
Name of the Emperor, That his Imperial Ma|je&s;ty was willing to &s;u&s;pend
the Proce&s;s again&s;t the Prince, and would agree, that in the A&s;&s;em|bly
at <HI>Nimmeguen,</HI> Con&s;ideration &s;hould be had of that Prince's
Detention, and of &s;eizing the Money at <HI>Cologne</HI>; but that the Prince
being a natural born Subject of the Emperor, he could not admit to put him into
a third Hand; upon which the King of <HI>Great Britain</HI> and the States were
&s;atisfied.</P>
<P>In the Year 1675, I had Notice given me by Mr. Secretary
<HI>Coventry,</HI> That the King was re|&s;olved I &s;hould follow the Camp,
and had or|dained an Allowance of 400 <HI>L. Sterling</HI> for my Equipage:
That I &s;hould be careful to write all that pa&s;&s;ed in the Army, and leave
&s;ome Per&s;on at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> to write all from thence, as fully as
I u&s;ed to do: That the Continuance of my Di|ligence <PB N="280" REF="300">
and Exactne&s;s was the Way to have my Pains valued, which would at la&s;t
bring a good Recompence with it.</P>
<P>In <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1677, I was advi&s;ed by Mr. Secre|tary
<HI>Coventry,</HI> that <HI>Mynheer van Benningham,</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI>
Envoy, had told him, that, in Di&s;|cour&s;e with <HI>Count de Ba&s;igni,</HI>
a Lieutenant Ge|neral of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Troops, I had told him at
<HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> had rai&s;ed his
Siege of <HI>Charleroy</HI> without fighting, to make him&s;elf King of his own
Country, with many other things very prejudicial to the Honour and Tru&s;t of
the Prince; which being known to the King and Duke, they were much concerned at
it: And that it would therefore become me pre|&s;ently to apply my &s;elf to
Count <HI>Ba&s;igni,</HI> to get a Certificate from him, that I had &s;aid no
&s;uch thing to him. The &s;ame Story was al&s;o told me by Mr. <HI>Laury
Hyde,</HI> who was newly arrived from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Court. Upon
the&s;e In|formations, I went forthwith to Count <HI>Ba&s;igni,</HI> and
&s;hewed him Mr. Secretary's Letter, which was wrote by Order from the King.
Where|upon <HI>Count de Ba&s;igni</HI> told me, I had always been e&s;teemed a
<HI>Frenchman,</HI> and that I had a great Inclination for that Nation: That he
had endeavoured to do me that Right, as to a&s;&s;ure the contrary, by
&s;aying, I was un&s;atisfied at the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s rai&s;ing his
Siege of <HI>Charleroy</HI> without fighting, which he had purpo&s;ely done, to
make him&s;elf King of <HI>Holland</HI> and the Low Countries. I then a&s;ked
him, whether he had ever heard me &s;ay any &s;uch thing? He then 
<PB N="281" REF="301"> confe&s;&s;ed he never heard me &s;ay &s;o, but that
what he had &s;aid was in my Ju&s;tification, and that I was not the Man that
others apprehended me to be: That I might make a good Excu&s;e to the
Secretary, by &s;aying, <HI>Count de Ba&s;igni</HI> not being well, was gone to
drink the <HI>Spaw</HI> Waters, and that at his Return I would get &s;uch a
Cer|tificate from him as was required: That in the mean time the Bu&s;ine&s;s
would be forgotten, and I &s;hould hear no more of it. But I told him plainly,
that &s;ince his Tongue had been too long, in &s;peaking that, as from me,
which I never &s;aid, whereby my Honour was in great Hazard, his Hand was not
too &s;hort to give me Satisfaction by his Pen; which if he refu&s;ed, he
mu&s;t do it with his Sword, and that my Coach was at his Door, and that I
would carry him out of the Ramparts, and the Bu&s;ine&s;s would quickly be
decided. To which he an|&s;wered, he would much more willingly give me
Satisfaction with his Sword, than with his Pen, after he had heard Ma&s;s at
the <HI>Domini|cans.</HI> Upon which I left him, and went to the
<HI>Dominicans</HI>; &s;oon after which, the Count came thither, and when the
Ma&s;s was ended, we went out together to my Coach, and putting him before me,
as I was going in after him, <HI>Don Antonio de Lera,</HI> and <HI>Don Martin
de les Ries,</HI> two <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Officers, &s;topp'd me, and &s;aid we
&s;hould not go together, for that they knew there was a Quarrel betwixt us,
and that they would &s;ecure and take <HI>Count de Ba&s;igni</HI> Pri&s;o|ner
from me, and would forthwith give Notice <PB N="282" REF="302"> of it to the
Governour, Vi&s;count <HI>Berling:</HI> Whereupon I went into my Coach, and
&s;ent immediately to Mr. <HI>Lent,</HI> who was Re&s;ident for the King of
<HI>Denmark.</HI> He came pre&s;ently to me, to whom I told all that happened:
Where|upon he offered me his Service, and &s;aid he would &s;tand by me, and
&s;erve me in all I &s;hould de&s;ire of him. Soon after Vi&s;count
<HI>Berlin</HI> came to me, to let me know, that he would endeavour to
compo&s;e the Difference amicably between Count <HI>Ba&s;igni</HI> and me, in
the Ab&s;ence of the <HI>Duc de Villa Hermo&s;a,</HI> and that he had &s;ecured
Count <HI>Ba&s;igni</HI> in his own Hou&s;e, but dur&s;t not meddle with me,
becau&s;e I was a publick Mini&s;ter; but de&s;ired I would not &s;tir abroad,
and that he hoped to compo&s;e the Dif|ference friendly between us. I &s;ent
forthwith to Mr. <HI>Hyde,</HI> to de&s;ire him to take my Coach to <HI>Bruin
le Comte,</HI> to &s;ee the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and to make my Excu&s;e
for not waiting upon his Highne&s;s, till I had freed my &s;elf from the
Imputation that was ca&s;t upon me. I had not been long at Home, but <HI>Count
de Tanuti,</HI> the Pope's Internuncio, accompanied with the Ab|bot of
<HI>Leyde,</HI> came to &s;ee me, and offered their Service for accommodating
the Bu&s;ine&s;s between us. The Internuncio told me, and &s;o did the Abbot of
<HI>Leyde,</HI> that they could not advi&s;e <HI>Count de Ba&s;igni</HI> to
give me &s;uch a Certificate as I de&s;ired, for that would be to give
him&s;elf the Lye; but I told them, he mu&s;t either do that, or fight with me,
and that I had rather lo&s;e my Life than my Honour.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="303">In the Afternoon of the &s;ame Day, Mr.
<HI>Ly|&s;eca,</HI> the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> who was Superintendant in the Place
of <HI>Don Pedro de Ronquillos,</HI> came to &s;ee me: Among&s;t other things,
he told me, that perchance he might do me &s;ome Service, becau&s;e, by virtue
of his Office, he could examine upon Oath, any Per&s;on that was Pri&s;oner
upon &s;uch an Occa&s;ion; and that if I would let him know what Que&s;tions he
&s;hould a&s;k him, he would not fail to do it; and that he would take a
<HI>Commis</HI> with him, who &s;hould put in Writing all that was &s;aid, of
which he would give me a Copy atte&s;ted under his Hand and Seal. Upon this I
told him, that he would plea&s;e to examine Count <HI>Ba&s;igni,</HI> how he
came to be a Pri&s;oner? and if there was a Quarrel betwixt us? and upon what
Account? And that, whether he had heard me at any time, e&s;pecially &s;ince
the Siege of <HI>Charleroy,</HI> &s;peak any thing again&s;t the Prince of
<HI>Orange,</HI> that might reflect upon his Honour, or Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in
him by the States General of the United Provinces? and that he, the Prince of
<HI>Orange,</HI> did not fight then, be|cau&s;e he would make him&s;elf King of
that Coun|try? To which Count <HI>Ba&s;igni</HI> an&s;wered upon Oath, That he
never heard me &s;peak any thing tending to the Di&s;honour of the Prince of
<HI>Orange,</HI> or breaking of his Tru&s;t to the States General; becau&s;e,
if he had heard any &s;uch thing, he would have que&s;tioned me for it. When
Mr. <HI>Ly&s;eca</HI> gave me this Account the next Day, I told him, I &s;hould
be very well &s;atisfied, if he would give me three Certificates &s;igned by 
<PB N="284" REF="304"> him&s;elf and his <HI>Commis,</HI> &s;ignifying what he
had told me; the one &s;hould be for the King and the Duke, the &s;econd for
the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and the third to be left in the Stadt-Hou&s;e at
<HI>Bru&s;&s;els, in perpetuam rei memoriam,</HI> which was done accordingly,
and all our Differences were amicably compo&s;ed. The King my Ma&s;ter, with
his Royal Highne&s;s, were entirely &s;atisfied with my Proceeding and Conduct
in this Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, as Mr. Secretary <HI>Coventry</HI> wrote me Word, and
the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was fully &s;atisfied, as Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI>
informed me, and as I under&s;tood afterwards from the Prince him&s;elf. But
this Affair &s;tuck upon <HI>Count de Ba&s;igni,</HI> as an ill Mark upon him,
who lived not many Years after it.</P>
<P>In <HI>March</HI> 1677, the Hou&s;e of Commons re|&s;olved, that
tho&s;e Per&s;ons who either advi&s;ed, compelled, a&s;&s;i&s;ted, or

the military Service of the <HI>French</HI> King, &s;ince the King's

<HI>Banqueting-Hou&s;e</HI> with their Addre&s;s. The King told them, it was of
great Weight, that he would take it into Con&s;ideration, and return them an
An&s;wer. The 28th of <HI>May</HI> he &s;ent for the Hou&s;e of Com|mons into
the <HI>Banqueting-Hou&s;e</HI> at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> and gave them this
following An&s;wer. That he could by no means approve of their la&s;t
Ad|dre&s;s, for that it contained many things unfit for them to meddle with,
and which intrenched upon the undoubted Right of the Crown, who&s;e Prerogative
it was to make Peace, and declare War: That his Maje&s;ty would never &s;uffer
to <PB N="290" REF="310"> be le&s;&s;ened &s;o e&s;&s;ential a Part of the
Monarchy: But withal his Maje&s;ty declared, that as he had done all that lay
in his Power, &s;o he would continue to apply him&s;elf by all the Means he
could, to let the World &s;ee his Care both for the Security and Satisfaction
of his People, tho' it might not be with tho&s;e Advantages to them, which by
their A&s;&s;i&s;tance he might have procured.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t not forget to tell, that in this Year 1677, the
Hou&s;e of Commons agreed up|on an Addre&s;s to his Maje&s;ty, to return him
their humble Thanks for expre&s;&s;ing his great Care of the Prote&s;tant
Religion, in marrying his Niece to a Prote&s;tant Prince, and did humbly
be&s;eech his Maje&s;ty to admit of no Treaty of Peace, but &s;uch a one as
leaves the <HI>French</HI> King in no better State or Condition to offend his
Neighbours, than he is left by the Treaty of the <HI>Pyrrbeneans.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>April</HI> 1678, the two Hou&s;es of Parliament met, and
the King being in his Robes in the Lords Hou&s;e, &s;ent for the Hou&s;e of
Commons to confirm their new Speaker, Sir <HI>Robert Sawyer</HI>; after which
the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>North</HI> (the Lord Chancellor being
indi&s;po&s;ed) acquainted the two Hou&s;es, That his Maje&s;ty hoped he
&s;hould have been able at their Meeting to have told &s;omething to their full
Satisfaction, but that things were not yet in that Condition, by rea&s;on the
<HI>Dutch</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador was not fully au|thorized to treat an Alliance,
which might com|prehend all the Allies, and particularly to en|gage, 
<PB N="291" REF="311"> that the States General &s;hould, in like manner as is
done in <HI>England,</HI> prohibite all Trade with <HI>France</HI>; and
therefore his Maje&s;ty had thought fit, that they &s;hould adjourn for &s;ome
&s;hort time longer, when his Maje&s;ty hoped he &s;hould be able to tell them
the Certainty of things, upon which they might take the Re&s;o|lutions that
were fit: Upon which both Hou|&s;es of Parliament adjourned them&s;elves.</P>
<P>About this time I received a Letter from Sir <HI>Jo&s;eph
William&s;on,</HI> in the&s;e Words.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE bear nothing yet of the great Bu&s;ine&s;s of our
<HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Company &s;o long &s;ince promi&s;ed, which is not yet
ended, nor like to be; the Commi&s;&s;ioners can come to no Agreement in their
Differences, each Company being ob&s;ti|nate in their Demands. All that is like
to be done is this, to leave Matters in the &s;ame State they were before the
Negotiation, and a Rule is made for the amicable Deci&s;ion of all Complaints,
which is this that follows. If Ju&s;tice be not done, or Satisfaction given to
the Parties by the King of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> or the <HI>States
General,</HI> re&s;pectively, in Three Months, then within Three Months after,
Four Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hall be named on each Side, who &s;hall be obliged to
determine it in Three Months following their A&s;&s;embly; and if they do not,
they &s;hall name an Arbitra|tor, to decide within Six Months: And if he do
not, and the Commi&s;&s;ioners cannot agree upon &s;uch an Arbitrator, then the
Cau&s;e to devolve <PB N="292" REF="312"> upon the King of <HI>Great
Britain</HI> and the <HI>States,</HI> to decide; and this to be the Method.
Upon each Complaint, the Commi&s;&s;ioners in the fir&s;t Ca&s;e to meet at
<HI>London,</HI> and in the &s;econd at the <HI>Hague,</HI> and &s;o
alternatively; and an Act is pa&s;&s;ed between the King and the
<HI>States,</HI> That the 9th Article of the Treaty at <HI>London,</HI> which
relates to this Matter of the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> and the Treaty Marine, be
executed, and no farther Proceedings to be had upon it: Upon which the Deputies
of the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Company are parted, as likewi&s;e the
Commi&s;&s;ioners for <HI>Surinam,</HI> the States of <HI>Zealand</HI> having
&s;ome Weeks pa&s;t &s;ent their Orders directly to <HI>Surinam,</HI> for
executing that Part of the Treaty, and bringing off the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> from

<P>The 14th of <HI>May</HI> his Maje&s;ty &s;ent a Me&s;&s;age to
the Hou&s;e of Commons, to let them know, that unle&s;s they did farther
&s;upply his Maje&s;ty, he &s;hould be forced to di&s;band all his Forces, and
to cea&s;e his Preparations for Sea; and in the Afternoon of that Day, the
Hou&s;e of Com|mons pre&s;ented their Addre&s;s, to which the King was
plea&s;ed to an&s;wer the next Day, That their Addre&s;s was &s;o extravagant,
that his Ma|je&s;ty did not think fit to give it the An&s;wer it de&s;erved,
and the next Day the King prorogued the Parliament to the 23d of <HI>May</HI>
1678. The 31&s;t of <HI>May</HI> the Hou&s;e of Commons ordered the Members of
the Privy Council, to pray his Maje&s;ty, that if he will plea&s;e to enter
into a War again&s;t the <HI>French</HI> King, they would &s;up|port him in it;
if otherwi&s;e, they would pro|ceed to provide for paying and di&s;banding the
Army: To which his Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed the next Day to an&s;wer, That the
<HI>French</HI> King had con&s;ented to a Ce&s;&s;ation to the 27th of
<HI>July,</HI> which his Maje&s;ty believed would be followed by a general
Peace; but that the King thought it nece&s;&s;ary to keep up his Army till that
time, and therefore called upon them forthwith to provide a Sub&s;i&s;tence for
them; Whereupon the <PB N="295" REF="315"> Hou&s;e re&s;olved, that all the
Forces rai&s;ed &s;ince the 29th of <HI>September</HI> la&s;t, be forthwith

towards the paying and di&s;banding the Forces that have been rai&s;ed &s;ince
the &s;aid 29th of <HI>September.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>November</HI> 1678 &s;everal Per&s;ons were ap|prehended
for High Trea&s;on, and were exa|mined before the Lords of the Privy Council,
and committed to <HI>Newgate,</HI> in order to their Tryal; and all that were,
or &s;u&s;pected to be <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks, were &s;eized upon, and the
Hou&s;e of Commons pa&s;&s;ed this following Vote, That, upon the Evidence that
had already ap|peared to them, there is, and hath been, a damnable helli&s;h
Plot contrived and carried on by the Popi&s;h Recu&s;ants, for
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating and murdering the King, and for &s;ubverting the
Government, and de&s;troying the Prote&s;tant Religion by Law e&s;tabli&s;hed;
and ordered, that this Vote be communicated to the Lords at a Conference, and
that the Lords be then de&s;ired to join with the Hou&s;e of Commons, in
providing Remedies for the Safety of his Ma|je&s;ty's &s;acred Per&s;on and
Government, and Prote&s;tant Religion by Law e&s;tabli&s;hed. His Maje&s;ty was
then plea&s;ed to i&s;&s;ue out his Pro|clamation, requiring all Popi&s;h
Recu&s;ants not to go five Miles from the Places of their Abode, and command
all of them to quit the City of <HI>London,</HI> without Exception of any
Per&s;on, but only foreign Mini&s;ters; and his Maje&s;ty <PB N="296" REF="316"> &s;ent an An&s;wer in Writing by one of his prin|cipal Secretaries
to the Addre&s;s for tendering the Oaths to all Per&s;ons re&s;iding in
<HI>Whitehall, St. James</HI>'s, and <HI>Somer&s;et-Hou&s;e,</HI> except the
menial Servants of the Queen and Dutche&s;s, who are excepted by Articles of
Marriage.</P>
<P>Upon the 4th of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1679, the King was taken at
<HI>Wind&s;or</HI> with an Indi&s;po&s;ition &s;omething like an Ague,
occa&s;ioned by a Cold, which made him very heavy, and took away his Stomach:
The News thereof being brought to the Duke at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> his Royal
Highne&s;s &s;ent for me at Ten at Night, and then he ac|quainted me with his
Intention of going early the next Morning for <HI>England,</HI> and commanded
me to make his Excu&s;e to the <HI>Duc de Villa Hermo&s;a,</HI> for not taking
Leave of his Excel|lency, his going being &s;o &s;udden, private, and
unexpected. The 5th of <HI>September</HI> following I had Letters from
<HI>England,</HI> that the Duke of <HI>York</HI> was &s;afely arrived at
<HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> and was mo&s;t kindly received by the King and all the
Court: That many Per&s;ons flocked thither to &s;ee the Duke, and ki&s;s his
Hands; and the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of <HI>London</HI> were re&s;olved to
come in a Body, to pay their Re&s;pects to his Royal Highne&s;s.</P>
<P>About this time Mr. Secretary <HI>Coventry</HI> wrote me Word,
That he had received an Expre&s;s from <HI>Spain,</HI> which he had long
expected: That he did believe that Court would not be &s;o quick in declaring a
Rupture, as &s;ome of their Mini|&s;ters in <HI>England</HI> had been, in both
threatning <PB N="297" REF="317"> and advi&s;ing it: That I might a&s;&s;ure
the <HI>Count de Fuentes,</HI> that our Ma&s;ter was never wanting in the
courteous receiving any publick Mini|&s;ter, much le&s;s one of his Character,
and &s;ent from &s;o great a King, whil&s;t they performed their Re&s;pects to
him; But when tho&s;e that are &s;ent to him make their Addre&s;&s;es
el&s;ewhere, and in a Fa&s;hion derogatory to his Government, he will let them
and the World know, that <HI>Eng|land</HI> is a Monarchy, and he the Monarch;
and that no Addre&s;&s;es in his Kingdom mu&s;t be made but to him, or by his
Approbation: That his Maje&s;ty had had from &s;everal Hands a very good
Character of the Count and his Temper, and hoped when he came, he would bring
Or|ders proportionable to &s;uch a Temper: That the King and Duke had declared
their Con&s;ent to the Marriage of the Lady <HI>Mary</HI> with the Prince of
<HI>Orange,</HI> which employed the Jollity of the Town that Night, which was
all at prefent from, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>George Wakeman</HI> was about this time tryed for High
Trea&s;on: <HI>Oates, Bedlow, Dug|dale,</HI> and <HI>Prance</HI> were
Witne&s;&s;es again&s;t him. <HI>Oates</HI> depo&s;ed, That Sir <HI>George
Wakeman</HI> had, to his Knowledge, accepted of Fifteen Thou|&s;and Pounds, to
poy&s;on the King, and had re|ceived Five Thou&s;and Pounds of it.
<HI>Bedlow</HI> depo&s;ed, That meeting Sir <HI>George Wakeman</HI> at
<HI>Harcourt</HI>'s Chamber, he had acquainted him with his De&s;ign of
poy&s;oning the King: But Sir <HI>Philip Lloyd,</HI> Clerk of the Privy
Council, depo&s;ed, That <HI>Oates</HI> before the Council being 
<PB N="298" REF="318"> a&s;ked, upon the fir&s;t Di&s;covery of the Plot,
whether he could &s;ay any thing of his own Knowledge, of Sir <HI>George
Wakeman,</HI> he an&s;we|red, God forbid, for he knew nothing of his own
Knowledge, but he had heard Sir <HI>George Wakeman</HI> was to poy&s;on the
King. To this <HI>Oates</HI> an&s;wered, That at the Council he was much
di&s;turbed, and his Memory was by that di&s;or|dered. And <HI>Bedlow</HI>
being a&s;ked by the Jury, whether he had &s;een Sir <HI>George Wakeman</HI>
be|fore he met him at <HI>Harcourt</HI>'s Chamber, he an&s;wered, No: Whereupon
the Jury reflected, that Sir <HI>George Wakeman</HI> mu&s;t needs be very
indi&s;creet to intru&s;t him with &s;o great a Secret; and &s;o Sir <HI>George
Wakeman,</HI> with three other Pri&s;oners, <HI>Mar&s;hal, Corker,</HI> and a
Lay-Brother, were all ab&s;olved after one Hour's Con&s;ultation.
<HI>Dugdale</HI> and <HI>Prance</HI> being the other Witne&s;&s;es, &s;pake
only as to the Plot in general; &s;o that Sir <HI>George Wakeman</HI> was
acquitted upon very good Rea&s;on, the Tryal having la&s;ted from Eight in the
Morning till Six at Night: But the common People would have all Papi&s;ts
hanged without more ado, and were much en|raged again&s;t both Jury and Judges,
and &s;wore they were all turned Papi&s;ts.</P>
<P>On the 10th of <HI>July</HI> 1679, the Privy Coun|cil ordered a
Proclamation &s;hould be drawn up for a new Parliament to meet the 7th of
<HI>Octo|ber</HI>; but the King ordered in Council at <HI>Ham|pton Court,</HI>
that the Parliament &s;hould not meet till the 17th of <HI>October,</HI> the
King intending to go to <HI>Newmarket</HI> &s;ome time in that Month, and 
<PB N="299" REF="319"> would after return to attend the Bu&s;ine&s;s in
Parliament without Intermi&s;&s;ion; but this Par|liament was afterwards
prorogued from the 17th of <HI>October</HI> to the 15th of <HI>April.</HI> In
the mean time there came out every Day &s;uch Swarms of impudent licentious
Libels upon all Sorts of Per&s;ons, and upon all Subjects, printed, as the like
was never known, and will be &s;till conti|nued whil&s;t the <HI>Habeas
Corpus</HI> is &s;till in Force, and that they are &s;ure to be bailed.</P>
<P>The King having written to the Univer&s;ity of
<HI>Cambridge,</HI> to let them know how much he was di&s;plea&s;ed with the
undutiful Carriage of the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> they did pre&s;ently
chu&s;e a new Chancellor. On the 21&s;t of <HI>April</HI> 1679, the King being
in his Robes in the Hou&s;e of Lords, and the Commons attending with their
Speaker, his Maje&s;ty made this following Speech to them.</P>
<Q> 
<TEXT LANG="eng">

<DIV1 TYPE="speech">
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>My Lords and Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Thought it nece&s;&s;ary to acquaint you what I have
done this Day, which is, that I have e&s;tabli&s;hed a new Privy-Council, the
con&s;tant Number of which &s;hall not exceed Thirty. I have made Choice of
&s;uch Per&s;ons as are worthy and able to advi&s;e me: And I am re&s;olved in
all my weighty and important Affairs (next to the Advice of my great Council in
Parliament, with which I &s;hall very often con&s;ult) to be advi&s;ed by this
Council. I would not make &s;o great a Change without acquainting both Hou&s;es
of Par|liament: And I de&s;ire you will all apply your &s;elves 
<PB N="300" REF="320"> heartily (as I &s;hall do) to tho&s;e things that are
nece&s;&s;ary for the Safety of the Kingdom, and that no Time may be lo&s;t in
it. The con&s;tant Number of the Council is to be Thirty, among&s;t which the
Princes of the Blood, the Pre&s;ident and Secre|tary of <HI>Scotland,</HI> are
not reckoned; becau&s;e it may happen there may be none of the fir&s;t nor
&s;e|cond, and the <HI>Scotch</HI> Secretary will not be con|&s;tantly
there.</P>
</DIV1>
</BODY>
</TEXT></Q>
<P>His Maje&s;ty then told both Hou&s;es, that he would hold no
more Cabinet Councils: A De|claration from the King is expected upon this
Change, which it is believed was hatched at a Meeting of the Privy Council the
Night be|fore, which was &s;o private, that the Clerks of the Council attending
were ordered to with|draw, which is not u&s;ual; and this Change did not meet
with that general Approbation of the Hou&s;e of Commons, as a Conde&s;cen&s;ion
of that Nature &s;eemed to challenge, as we may perceive by deferring the
Con&s;ideration of giving his Ma|je&s;ty Thanks for his Speech, which in good
Manners they ought to have done immediately.</P>
<P>The Day before the King declared this great Change of his
Council, the Hou&s;e of Commons came to this Re&s;olution, That it was their
Opi|nion, that the Duke of <HI>York</HI> being a Papi&s;t, and the Hopes of his
coming &s;uch to the Crown, had given the greate&s;t Countenance and
Encou|ragement to the pre&s;ent Con&s;piracy of the Pa|pi&s;ts again&s;t his
Maje&s;ty and the Prote&s;tant Re|ligion; and this Re&s;olution was &s;ent up
to the <PB N="301" REF="321"> Lords, for their Concurrence, by the Lord
<HI>Ru&s;&s;el.</HI> The Hou&s;e of Commons made likewi&s;e an Addre&s;s to his
Maje&s;ty in the <HI>Banqueting-Hou&s;e,</HI> That <HI>Pickering</HI> and the
other Popi&s;h Prie&s;ts con|demned might be &s;peedily executed. To which his
Maje&s;ty an&s;wered, That he was very tender of Blood, but would &s;end them
an An&s;wer to their Addre&s;s very &s;peedily. The Commons then voted, That a
Bill &s;hould be brought in, for di&s;abling the Duke of York to inherit the
imperial Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and that they would &s;tand by the King
with their Lives and Fortunes; and that if the King (which God forbid) &s;hould
be taken away by any &s;udden Accident, they would revenge him to the ut|mo&s;t
upon all the Papi&s;ts in <HI>England.</HI> The Tryal of the Lords in the
<HI>Tower</HI> was deferred for &s;ome time, and a Committee of both Hou&s;es
met to adju&s;t the Preliminaries. The Lords have at la&s;t come to
Re&s;olution, that the Lords Spiritual have a right to &s;tay in Court in all
capital Cau&s;es, till &s;uch time as Judgment of Death comes to be pronounced,
which they have declared and explained to be, till the Hou&s;e proceeds to the
Votes of Guilty, or Not Guilty. The Commons were not at all con|tented with
this Declaration of the Lords, nor with their Lord&s;hips having appointed the
Tryal of the Popi&s;h Lords in the <HI>Tower,</HI> be|fore the Earl of
<HI>Danby</HI> came to his Tryal.</P>
<P>The 9th of <HI>July</HI> 1679, the Council ordered a
Proclamation &s;hould be drawn up for a new Parliament; but his Maje&s;ty
finding that the <PB N="302" REF="322"> two Hou&s;es could not agree about the
Tryal of the Lords, and that they grew to exce&s;&s;ive Heats, was plea&s;ed to
prorogue them till the 24th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> and the next Day he &s;ent
for the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen to the Council, and gave them Orders
to appea&s;e all groundle&s;s Jealou&s;ies which &s;ome Men endeavou|red to
rai&s;e in People's Minds; and the Ju&s;tices of the Peace in
<HI>Middle&s;ex</HI> had the like Orders given them in Council, and to proceed
to put the Laws in Execution again&s;t the Papi&s;ts: And the Lord Chancellor
acquainted the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, that the King commanded them to put the
Laws exactly in Execution again&s;t Pa|pi&s;ts: And becau&s;e &s;ome might
pretend to be in Town as Witne&s;&s;es for the Popi&s;h Lords in the
<HI>Tower,</HI> and others might pre&s;ume, upon the Pro|roguing of the
Parliament, to appear, which be|fore they dur&s;t not do, his Maje&s;ty
commanded to double their Diligence for finding out all Papi&s;ts, and
proceeding to a &s;peedy Conviction of them, his Maje&s;ty being re&s;olved,
that they &s;hould be proceeded again&s;t with greater Seve|rity than if the
Parliament were &s;itting, the King being ab&s;olutely re&s;olved to clear the
City of Papi&s;ts: And, a farther Mark of the King's Zeal in the&s;e
Proceedings was, that he comman|ded the &s;everal Prie&s;ts who had been
condemned &s;hould be executed forthwith according to the Sentence pa&s;&s;ed
upon them. So much did his Maje&s;ty's Proceedings differ now from the Opi|nion
he had at <HI>Cologne,</HI> which was never to put the Penal Laws in
Execution.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="323">It &s;eems the Lords and Commons could not
come to any Agreement about the Try|als of the Lords in the <HI>Tower.</HI> The
Com|mons re&s;olved to have the Earl of <HI>Danby</HI> come fir&s;t, and to
exclude the Bi&s;hops from &s;itting ill the Court; &s;o that the King was
nece&s;&s;itated to a Prorogation, to abate their Heats; and there was an
Expedient intended to be propo&s;ed in the Earl of <HI>Danby</HI>'s Ca&s;e,
which was, That he &s;hould be perpetually bani&s;hed and degraded, to &s;ee
how that would take: But the Earl's Con&s;ent being a&s;ked to the
Propo&s;ition, he po|&s;itively refu&s;ed it, and &s;aid he would &s;tand or
fall by his Pardon, and nothing el&s;e.</P>
<P>The Heats which appeared upon proroguing the Parliament in
<HI>June</HI> 1679, were much aba|ted, and People's Thoughts &s;omewhat quieted
by what the King had plea&s;ed to do; &s;ince fir&s;t, by giving &s;trict
Orders to the Lord Mayor and Ju&s;tices of the Peace of
<HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> to put the Laws in Execution again&s;t the Papi&s;ts,
and di|recting Mr. Attorney General to bring tho&s;e that were Pri&s;oners for
the Plot to a &s;peedy Tryal; in commanding the Execution of the condemned
Prie&s;ts, and in ordering an Account to be made in every County, of tho&s;e
Per&s;ons that are fitting to be Ju&s;tices of Peace, and in declaring the Duke
of <HI>York</HI> &s;hould not return during the Prorogation.</P>
<P>There was a warm Report about this time, that the Earl of
<HI>Shaftsbury</HI> was to leave the Council, and the Lord <HI>Roberts</HI> to
be made Lord Pre&s;ident in his Place. The Occa&s;ion of this 
<PB N="304" REF="324"> Report was, that the Lord <HI>Roberts</HI> was a great
A&s;&s;ertor of the Rights of the Lords and the Bi&s;hops, when the Earl of
<HI>Shaftsbury</HI> was of a contrary Opinion. It &s;eems the Hou&s;e of
Com|mons continued very eager upon the Search of &s;uch Per&s;ons as had in the
la&s;t Parliament re|ceived any Money, which was put upon the Account of
&s;ecret Service; and having gotten a Li&s;t of many Names, they examined Sir
<HI>Ste|phen Fox,</HI> the Pay-Ma&s;ter General, if he had not payed Money to
&s;uch as they named. He confe&s;&s;ed, that he had payed &s;everal Sums, and
named the Per&s;ons to whom he had payed Mo|ney for &s;ecret Service; but the
Commons being not content with his verbal Confe&s;&s;ion, they would &s;ee his
Books of Accompts, and &s;ent a Committee of the Hou&s;e to <HI>Whitehall,</HI>
to fetch the Books; but the Lord Chamberlain told the Committee, that, by
virtue of his Office, he could not &s;uffer any Search to be made in the King's
Hou&s;e, without his Maje&s;ty's Leave; and &s;o the Committee went away
without them, but Mr. <HI>Bertie</HI> was kept in Cu&s;tody for not de|livering
his Books of the Trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>In <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1679, Sir <HI>Lionel Jenkins</HI> landed at
<HI>Greenwich,</HI> and went directly to <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> to ki&s;s the
King's Hands, and was very well re|ceived of his Maje&s;ty. The Duke's Arrival
at <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> from <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> incognito, was a great
Surprize to them. His Royal Highne&s;s was mo&s;t kindly received by the King;
but it was not determined whether he &s;hould continue in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> or
return to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els.</HI> Great Numbers <PB N="305" REF="325"> of People
of all Qualities did daily come to Court to ki&s;s the Duke's Hands, which
makes the World believe his Pre&s;ence is very accepta|ble. About this time the
Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> laid down his Commi&s;&s;ion of being General, and
was by his Maje&s;ty's Command to leave <HI>England</HI> in few Days; and the
Duke of <HI>York</HI> is likewi&s;e to return to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els.</HI> He is
at pre|&s;ent lodged in <HI>Whitehall,</HI> and will go with his Maje&s;ty to
<HI>New-market,</HI> to which Place he is re&s;olved to go, tho' his
Phy&s;icians advi&s;e the contrary. It is &s;aid the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>
is often in Di&s;cour&s;e with the King, not having a Mind to leave
<HI>England,</HI> and is pa&s;&s;ing his Par|don under the Great Seal, before
he goes, the King being re&s;olved upon his going. When the King and Queen go
to <HI>New-market,</HI> the Duke of <HI>York</HI> returns towards
<HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> goes for
<HI>Holland,</HI> intending to re&s;ide at <HI>Utrecht,</HI> Prince
<HI>Rupert</HI> having lent him his Hou&s;e at <HI>Rhenen.</HI> The Dutche&s;s
does not accompany the Duke, the King having di&s;&s;waded her from it.</P>
<P>I was about this time informed from <HI>Whitehall,</HI> that the
17th of <HI>October</HI> drawing on, when the Parliament was to meet, I
&s;hould have News from thence, but they could not promi&s;e me it &s;hould be
good at the &s;ame time; and from the &s;ame Hand I was told, that the Lord
Chief Ju&s;tice being in his Circuit, and giving his Charge to the Grand Jury,
among&s;t other things, recommended unto them the &s;trict executing the Laws
again&s;t Papi&s;ts: Whereupon the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> 
<PB N="306" REF="326"> (who was in the Court upon the Bench) &s;tood up and
&s;aid, <HI>It was well indeed if that were done; but that the Lord Chief
Ju&s;tice, when he gave that Charge, did not mean it &s;hould be ob&s;er|ved,
becau&s;e he was a Favourer of the Papi&s;ts, and that he</HI> (the Duke)
<HI>knew he had private Or|ders to a&s;&s;i&s;t and favour the Papi&s;t all he
could:</HI> Which la&s;t is a Reflection upon the King pu|ni&s;hable by the
Law, which declares it Trea|&s;on to &s;ay the King is a Papi&s;t. It is added
to me in my Letter, from a very good Hand, that the Duke did hereupon
ab&s;cond, and that the Chief Ju&s;tice, before he gave out his Warrant,
complained to the King, and had the King's Directions in it, and I have been
&s;ince told, that the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> was gone pri|vately into
<HI>Holland,</HI> and was there &s;een by them that well knew his Grace.</P>
<P>The Parliament was prorogued this Day for Fourteen Days longer,
his Maje&s;ty having de|clared to the Council, that he was de&s;irous to
&s;pend &s;ome more Days at <HI>New-market,</HI> finding that Air very
agreeable to him; and that after his Return he had &s;everal Matters to prepare
for the Parliament, which he thought would not be unplea&s;ing to them, which
would not be ready again&s;t the Time it was at fir&s;t inten|ded they &s;hould
be. The Yacht that carried his Royal Highne&s;s to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> did
bring back the Lady <HI>Anne</HI> and the Lady <HI>I&s;abella</HI> to
<HI>London,</HI> with the Dutche&s;s of <HI>York.</HI></P>
<P>On the 10th of <HI>October</HI> Mr. Secretary <HI>Coven|try</HI>
communicated a Letter to tho&s;e in his Of|fice, <PB N="307" REF="327"> which
he had then received from <HI>New|market</HI> by the King's Command, that the
Duke of <HI>York,</HI> before his Return to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> had
de|&s;ired he might live in the Dominions of his Maje&s;ty, rather than in
tho&s;e of any other Prince; and having a&s;ked the King's Leave to go to
<HI>Scotland,</HI> the King had granted it, and ac|cordingly had ordered two
Frigates to be ready in the <HI>Downes</HI> to tran&s;port his Royal
Highne&s;s, and the Duke of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> was di&s;patched to
<HI>Scotland,</HI> to make Preparations for his Royal Highne&s;s's Reception,
which was hindered for &s;ome time by the unlucky Accident which happened at
Sea. However, the 12th of <HI>Octo|ber,</HI> both their Royal Highne&s;&s;es
arrived at Court, and were very well received by all that End of the Town, but
I know not whether I can &s;ay &s;o much for the other: Their Stay will be
&s;hort, being de&s;igned for <HI>Scotland,</HI> where, by his Maje&s;ty's
Leave, they intend to re&s;ide.</P>
<P>The 17th of <HI>October</HI> 1679, the Parliament met, and were
prorogued to the 28th of <HI>Janu|ary</HI>; and at the &s;ame time, one of the
princi|pal Secretaries of State, by his Letter to the Earl of
<HI>Shaftsbury,</HI> let his Lord&s;hip know, by the King's Command, that his
Maje&s;ty intended to make no more U&s;e of his Lord&s;hip at the Council
Table; and not only excu&s;ed his Lord|&s;hip for attending as Pre&s;ident of
the Council, but di&s;charged him from his farther Attendance there; and the
24th of the &s;ame Month his Maje&s;ty ordered the Earl of <HI>Radnor</HI> to
take the Place of Lord Pre&s;ident of the Council <PB N="308" REF="328"> Table,
in the Place of the Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury,</HI> which the Earl of
<HI>Radnor</HI> did accordingly. Mr. <HI>Oates</HI>'s Complaint again&s;t Sir
<HI>Philip Lloyd,</HI> one of the Clerks of the Council, was heard, and it
being proved that Sir <HI>Philip</HI> had, in a Coffee-hou&s;e, &s;poken &s;ome
Words, as if he did not believe the Plot, and be&s;ides, &s;poke
in|di&s;creetly at the Tryal of Sir <HI>George Wakeman</HI>; the King, as a
Mark of his Di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;u&s;pen|ded him the Execution of his Place.
Then the Matter again&s;t Sir <HI>Thomas Williams</HI> the Chymi&s;t was heard;
and it appearing that, of his own Head, he had gone with pretended Me&s;&s;ages
between the Duke and Mr. <HI>Oates,</HI> which he then denied, as well as
&s;ome Words which were proved he had &s;aid to Mr. <HI>Oates,</HI> viz.
<HI>That he knew enough to ruine the Duke and all his Party,</HI> he was, by
Order of the Council, committed to the <HI>Gate-Hou&s;e.</HI> It &s;eems Mr.
<HI>Oates</HI> was at <HI>Oxford,</HI> and would have had the &s;ame Degree of
Doctor as he pre|tended to have had at <HI>Salamanca,</HI> but they re|fu&s;ed
him.</P>
<P>We are told, their Royal Higne&s;&s;es, in their Pa&s;&s;age for
<HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;tayed &s;ome Days at <HI>York</HI> to re&s;t them&s;elves
before they went into <HI>Scot|land,</HI> and that the Lord Mayor and Aldermen
did not &s;hew that Re&s;pect to them which they expected; of which the King
being informed, and that their Behaviour differed much from what it did before,
at the Duke's former Pa&s;&s;age there, his Maje&s;ty was thereupon much
di&s;plea|&s;ed, the which he &s;ignified to the Lord Mayor 
<PB N="309" REF="329"> and Aldermen of that City, letting them know, that his
Maje&s;ty expects, whenever the Duke pa&s;&s;es that Way again, that they treat
him in the &s;ame Manner as they did formerly, and that they &s;hew him that
Re&s;pect which becomes all good Subjects to &s;hew to the King's Brother. The
<HI>Scots</HI> &s;eem greatly plea&s;ed at the Duke's Coming, and that they
&s;hall have a Court kept among&s;t them.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> the 3d, 1679, I am told, they are again at
<HI>London</HI> launched into the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Plot, one
<HI>Dangerfield</HI> having been &s;everal Days before the Council in
Examination; but People are not very ha&s;ty to give Credit to his Relation,
who hath been once, if not oftener, in the Pillory, and is now in
<HI>Newgate.</HI> A Proclamation is in the Pre&s;s, and will &s;ud|denly
i&s;&s;ue out, for giving Notice, that who|ever knows any thing of the Plot,
and does not di&s;cover it before the End of next <HI>February,</HI> he is to
expect the Penalty of the Law for Mi&s;pri&s;ion of Trea&s;on, and is not to
have any Benefit of Pardon. About this time there was another new Di&s;coverer
of the Plot upon the King's Life come in: He was a Servant to Sir <HI>Thomas
Ga&s;coign,</HI> a <HI>York&s;hire</HI> Gentleman of a great E&s;tate, and
great Age. However, he is &s;ent for to <HI>Whitehall</HI> by a Me&s;&s;enger.
The&s;e &s;everal Di&s;coverers, will, I hope, let us &s;ee the Bottom, or at
lea&s;t the End once of this Matter. I am informed from a good Hand at
<HI>Whitehall,</HI> of a warm Report &s;pread abroad, that the Earl of
<HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> Fir&s;t Commi&s;&s;ioner of the Trea&s;ury, 
<PB N="310" REF="330"> and his Brother Sir <HI>Henry Capel,</HI> Fir&s;t
Com|mi&s;&s;ioner of the Admiralty, are both withdraw|ing them&s;elves from the
Court and Council, tho' there be no Rea&s;on yet known for it, the King not
having &s;hewed any Disfavour to either of them. The Humour is much changed,
when &s;uch Men quit their Places without any vi&s;ible Rea&s;ons; and
therefore we may well think the King will be as willing to accept, as they are
to re&s;ign.</P>
<P>I had Letters from <HI>Whitehall</HI> of the 20th of
<HI>November,</HI> which &s;aid, the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> came to Town
unlook'd for; that &s;o &s;oon as his Coming was known, the People made
Bon|fires, &s;hot off Guns, and rung their Bells. He offered to &s;ee the King,
but his Maje&s;ty not only refu&s;ed him, becau&s;e he returned without his
Orders, but forbad him the Court, and or|dered him to return within Twenty Four
Hours, when Preparations were making of new Bon|fires, which were
&s;uppre&s;&s;ed; and yet the Duke continued &s;till in Town, the 8th of
<HI>December,</HI> but &s;tript of all Employments, and no great Talk of
him.</P>
<P>An Addre&s;s hath been made to the King by Eight Lords, for the
Meeting of the Parlia|ment at the Time appointed, and the &s;ame has been done
by the Lord Mayor and Aldermen to the King in Council, where, after the Lord
Chancellor had done, the King &s;poke him&s;elf, and told the Lord Mayor and
Aldermen with great Earne&s;tne&s;s, That he could not endure any longer
tho&s;e factious Doings, and expected the City of <HI>London</HI> &s;hould be
an Example to <PB N="311" REF="331"> the whole Kingdom, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> A
Proclamation was then ordered to be printed and publi&s;hed, to forewarn all
People from &s;igning &s;uch Petitions, &s;hewing the Danger they will run
them&s;elves into by &s;o doing.</P>
<P>The 15th of <HI>October</HI> 1679, the Ju&s;tices of
<HI>Middle&s;ex</HI> and <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> were called before the Privy
Council, and were &s;trictly charged to put the Laws in Execution again&s;t the
Papi&s;ts, and that they &s;hould meet and con&s;ult of &s;uch Expedients as
they &s;hould think mo&s;t effectual, and return the &s;ame to the Board; and a
Com|mittee of the Council were appointed Com|mi&s;&s;ioners to receive and
con&s;ider of &s;uch Pro|po&s;itions, and to propo&s;e &s;uch other Expedients
as &s;hould occur to them. Hereupon the Ju&s;ti|ces of Peace of
<HI>Middle&s;ex</HI> and <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> did make their Report to the
Council, of the &s;eve|ral Expedients which they had agreed to among&s;t
them&s;elves, for the better executing the Laws again&s;t Papi&s;ts, which the
Privy Council ap|proved of. It &s;eems, notwith&s;tanding the Pro|clamation,
&s;ome &s;editious People would fain bring on the Petitions, as well about the
Court, as in <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>; and tho' they are not con&s;iderable enough to
bring the Matter to any Head, yet it may give Encouragement to others, if it be
not puni&s;hed: And upon Information of this, the Privy Council have &s;ent for
Three or Four of the principal Per&s;ons ingaged herein, and the great
Expectation is, to &s;ee how they will proceed again&s;t them: And it is
&s;u&s;pected, that the City of <HI>London,</HI> with &s;ome of the Coun|ties 
<PB N="312" REF="332"> adjoining, have not quite laid a&s;ide their De&s;ign of
Petitioning his Maje&s;ty for a Parlia|ment, notwith&s;tanding there is &s;mall
Appea|rance it will be to any Effect. In the mean time, the Privy Council have
taken &s;everal Re|&s;olutions concerning the vigorous Pro&s;ecution of the
Papi&s;ts, which will be executed without any Connivance or Partiality, and the
particu|lar Method that will be taken, is &s;et down in a Proclamation that is
now in the Pre&s;s for that Purpo&s;e. We are told from <HI>Scotland,</HI> that
the Duke has taken his Place in the Privy Council of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and as
Fir&s;t Prince of the Blood, was di&s;pen&s;ed with as to taking the Oaths,
which is likewi&s;e the Practice in <HI>England:</HI> For, at the forming the
pre&s;ent Privy Council, all the Lords were &s;worn, except Prince
<HI>Rupert,</HI> who being a Prince of the Blood, he was not &s;worn.</P>
<P>In <HI>June</HI> 1680, I received this en&s;uing Let|ter from
Mr. Secretary <HI>Jenkins.</HI></P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am infinitely obliged to you for your con&s;tant
Corre&s;pondence. La&s;t Night, a Defen&s;ive Alliance between his Maje&s;ty
and the King of <HI>Spain</HI> was &s;igned: It is the &s;ame in Effect with
that made in 1673, between <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> and that in
1678 between his Maje&s;ty and <HI>Hol|land.</HI> It is his Maje&s;ty's
In&s;truction to all his Mini&s;ters abroad, not to make any Flouri&s;h or

Occa&s;ions that &s;hall be given by the Enquiries of other Men) that there 
<PB N="313" REF="333"> is &s;uch a League newly made; that it is &s;uch a one
that can give no Offence or Umbrage to any Neighbour Prince, it being purely
defen&s;ive, and inducing no Obligation, but that the two Kings defend each
other in their pre&s;ent Peace and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, again&s;t any that
&s;hall aggre&s;s or in|vade them. I am, Sir,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your mo&s;t Humble Servant, <HI>L.

</LETTER>
<P>Some time after this, the Earl of <HI>Danby</HI> peti|tioned the
King and Hou&s;e of Lords, that he might be tryed; but nothing being done in
it, his Lord&s;hip petitioned farther, that he might be bailed, and his Ca&s;e
was argued by Mr. <HI>Polexton, Wallop,</HI> and <HI>Holt,</HI> and likewi&s;e
by my Lord him|&s;elf. The Sub&s;tance of what was &s;aid is reducible to Four
Heads. Fir&s;t, The King's Prerogative. Secondly, The Liberty of the Subject.
Thirdly, The Privilege of Parliament: And Fourthly, The Juri&s;diction of the
Court of King's Bench.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, It was urged, That, by bailing of my Lord, the King's
Prerogative would be main|tained, which would otherwi&s;e &s;uffer by his
longer Confinement: For that he produced the King's Pardon, as a great Motive
to incline the Court to bail him. Be&s;ides that, Mr. Attorney had declared the
King's particular Inclination to con&s;ent to it; and the King having Power to
pardon a Per&s;on impeached (which Mr. <HI>Polex|ton</HI> &s;aid no Man of the
Robe ought to que&s;tion) tho' the Impeachment be not at his Suit, it was hoped
the Court would take &s;o much Notice of <PB N="314" REF="334"> the&s;e
Intimations of his Maje&s;ty's Ju&s;tice, as to let my Lord out upon Bail,
whereby they would a&s;&s;ert the King's true Power and ju&s;t Prerogative; it
being hard, that there &s;hall not be a Power of Bailing where there is a Power
of Pardoning.</P>
<P>Secondly, The Liberty of the Subject will be pre&s;erved by it;
for if there be no Remedy for any Per&s;on impeached, but that he mu&s;t lye by
it, till he be enlarged by the &s;ame Power that committed him, it would
follow, that, during the Rece&s;&s;es of Parliament, a Failure of Ju&s;tice
would ari&s;e, which will be a heavy Blow to that natural Freedom to which the
Sub|jects of <HI>England</HI> by Birth-right are intituled; and &s;uch a
Puni&s;hment as is not only a Con|demnation, but may prove even an Execution
before Tryal: For probably, my Lord being oppre&s;&s;ed with the Inconvenience
of the Place, and with his own Infirmities, may die in the Jayl before his
Enlargement by his Peers, and the Stain of his Impeachment dwell upon his
Memory, and his Po&s;terity for ever: For the Prevention of which lamentable
Ca&s;e, and for Pre&s;ervation of that due Liberty which the King's Subjects
ought to have, it was conceived that my Lord ought to be bailed.</P>
<P>Thirdly, The Privileges of Parliament would not hereby be
infringed; for, to bail a Man being committed by a &s;uperior Court, is not to
a&s;&s;ume a Juri&s;diction of his Cau&s;e, or any way to claim a Cognizance of
it (which it was granted the Court of King's Bench, in Ca&s;es of 
<PB N="315" REF="335"> Impeachment, ought not to do) but it was on|ly an
enlarging of his Pri&s;on, or (as Mr. <HI>Wal|lop</HI> &s;aid, a lengthening of
his Chain, in&s;tead of his remaining <HI>in arcta cu&s;todia,</HI> for &s;o is
every Man let out upon good Bail pre&s;umed to be; and the Law looks upon his
Forthcoming to be as &s;ecure as if he were under clo&s;e Confinement: So that
&s;uch a Proceeding as this is not to in|trench, or to encroach upon the
Privileges of Parliament, but only to avoid a great Evil, a Failure of
Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Fourthly, By bailing my Lord of <HI>Danby,</HI> the Court would
a&s;&s;ert their own Juri&s;diction, it being conceived that the Court of
King's Bench have always intermeddled with Circum|&s;tances and mediate Acts
relating to things done in Parliament, thereafter, as the Nece&s;&s;ity of the
Ca&s;e required (tho' not with the very things them&s;elves) and to that
Purpo&s;e &s;everal Prece|dents were cited; as one of <HI>Okey,</HI> and two
other Traitors, who were attainted in Parliament, and before Execution awarded,
there happened a Pro|rogation. Whereupon the Record of their Con|viction was
removed into the King's Bench, and the Pri&s;oners brought to the Bar, and
having nothing to &s;ay why Execution &s;hould not be awarded again&s;t them,
were accordingly exe|cuted. This was the Sum of what was &s;aid by all tho&s;e
that argued. The Court was divided, whether they &s;hould give their Opinion
pre|&s;ently, or take Time; but they re&s;olved to con|&s;ider till the next
Term, and my Lord was again remanded to Pri&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="336">Upon this Occa&s;ion, I have thought fit
to give a Copy of the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Pember|ton</HI>'s Charge, upon

<P>THE Pri&s;oner at the Bar, Gentlemen of of the Jury, is
charged with Trea&s;on, for Libelling the Government, and &s;etting others to
do it. Whether <HI>Fitzharris</HI> be the Author of this Libel, or not, is the
Que&s;tion. The Evi|dence again&s;t him is very great. Mr. <HI>Everard</HI>
declares to you the whole De&s;ign and Di&s;cour&s;e with him; he tells you the
Manner, and gives you the very Grounds on which the Libel was to be written. It
was, to rai&s;e Sedition, to make an In&s;urrection, and to &s;tir up People to
rebel. Mr. <HI>Eve|rard</HI> was &s;o cautious, that he walked not alone in
this Ca&s;e, but with much Prudence declared it to others, that they might be
Witne&s;&s;es with him, and Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> agrees with him in all things:
How he heard <HI>Fitzharris</HI> give the Directions for ma|king this Libel,
heard the De&s;ign of it, and the Reward promi&s;ed for the doing it, which was
the fir&s;t Night. The next Night Sir <HI>William Waller</HI> was pre&s;ent,
and &s;ays, <HI>Fitzharris</HI> gave the &s;ame In&s;tructions, and owned them;
and what is not to be an&s;wered, they are all under his own Hand; which
Directions are Trea&s;on enough, and is as &s;trong an Evidence again&s;t him
as perhaps ever was; and I think a plainer Evidence cannot be given, than that
<HI>Fitzharris</HI> is the Author of this Libel. The Witne&s;&s;es he brings

<P>The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> having lately pa&s;&s;ed up and
down the Kingdom in a Manner that gave much Offence to his Maje&s;ty; and
having been at <HI>We&s;t-Che&s;ter,</HI> where the Mayor being a 
<PB N="320" REF="340"> Fanatick, and his Wife Neice to the late
<HI>Brad|&s;haw,</HI> the Great Traitor, his Grace was very well received by
them; but at <HI>Litchfield, Coventry,</HI> and other Places, neither the
Magi|&s;trates nor Gentry took much Notice of him. However, by the King's
Command, a Sergeant at Arms was &s;ent down to <HI>Stafford</HI> to bring him
up; and being brought to one of the Secreta|ries of State, after Examination of
him, he committed him by a &s;econd Warrant to the Cu&s;tody of the Sergeant at
Arms (which War|rant charged his Grace to have pa&s;&s;ed thro' &s;e|veral
Parts of the Kingdom, with great Num|bers of People, in a riotous Manner, to
the Di&s;turbance of the Publick Peace, and to the Terror of the King's good

the Earl of <HI>Clare,</HI> the Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> Lord <HI>Grey,</HI>
Mr. <HI>Gower</HI> and Mr. <HI>Offeley,</HI> being his Bail. The Duke was bound
in Ten Thou|&s;and Pounds, and the Bail each in Two Thou|&s;and Pounds. The
Behaviour of the Duke gives the King every Day more Offence, and particu|larly
his having acco&s;ted the Earl of <HI>Hallifax</HI> with very unbecoming
Language, upon Ac|count <PB N="321" REF="341"> of &s;omething &s;uppo&s;ed his
Lord&s;hip had &s;aid in Council concerning the Duke of <HI>Mon|mouth.</HI> The
King was plea&s;ed in Council to declare, That he looked upon it as an
In&s;olence offered to him&s;elf, for any one to que&s;tion a Privy
Coun&s;ellour for any thing &s;aid in Coun|cil; and did &s;trictly forbid all
Per&s;ons having any Relation to his Service, to have for the future any
Communication with the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> who hath been &s;o angry with
his Wife for &s;eeing the Dutche&s;s, by whom &s;he was very kindly received,
that the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> will not &s;ee his Dutche&s;s.</P>
<P>An Action of <HI>Scandalum Magnatum,</HI> in Be|half of the

when his Royal Highne&s;s dined la&s;t in <HI>London</HI> with the
<HI>Artillery Company.</HI> The Words &s;poken were the&s;e: <HI>He hath burnt

<HI>York.</HI> The Jury were all Gentlemen of Quality of
<HI>Hertford&s;hire</HI> (which County Mr. <HI>Pilkington</HI> had cho&s;en)
and they gave his Royal Highne&s;s One Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds Damage; which

much Licence in their Di&s;cour&s;es, to govern their Tongues better.</P>
<P>Letters from <HI>Scotland</HI> tell us, that Affairs go there
according to Wi&s;h: That the Parlia|ment there have written a Letter of Thanks
to the King, for &s;ending the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> which we hope will break
the Mea&s;ures of tho&s;e <PB N="322" REF="342"> who flattered them&s;elves
with a Support from that Kingdom, which has not been in many Ages more united
than it is at pre&s;ent, under the prudent Conduct of his Royal Highne&s;s. Our
Letters from thence tell us, that the Lords of the Articles had prepared three
publick Bills; the Fir&s;t, for recognizing the Rights of the Crown and the
Succe&s;&s;ion; the Second, for continuing a Tax for Five Years longer, for
Maintainance of the &s;tanding Forces: The Third, a Bill for e&s;tabli&s;hing
the Prote&s;tant Religion, which pa&s;&s;ed very chearfully in the Articles,
and Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> concurred in them all. The Letters add, That the
Duke is high|ly e&s;teemed and beloved of all Sorts of People, and that there
is a con&s;tant and great Court of Lords and Ladies. Major <HI>Oglethorp</HI>
brings this Account, which is very plea&s;ing to all the People in this
Court.</P>
<P>The Apprentices in <HI>London</HI> pre&s;ented their Petition to
his Maje&s;ty, with Twelve Thou&s;and Hands, to give his Maje&s;ty Thanks for
his late Declaration. It met with a gracious Ac|ceptance, and tho&s;e that
carried it were intro|duced by the Lord Chamberlain, and had the Honour to
ki&s;s his Maje&s;ty's Hand. The King gave them a Brace of Bucks out of
<HI>Hyde</HI> Park, and they made a great Fea&s;t in <HI>London.</HI> The Duke
of <HI>Albemarle,</HI> and many of the Nobility did them the Honour to be
pre&s;ent at their Fea&s;t, which they intend to keep annually; and the Duke of
<HI>Grafton</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Fever&s;ham</HI> have done them the Honour
to be their Stew|ards <PB N="323" REF="343"> for the next Year. The Apprentices
of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> in Imitation of tho&s;e of <HI>London,</HI> have
&s;ub&s;cribed an Addre&s;s, to give the King their mo&s;t humble Thanks for
his gracious Declara|tion. The Nobility and Gentry of <HI>Norfolk</HI> have
done the like; and the Addre&s;&s;es from all Parts on the &s;ame Account come
in very fa&s;t; and one has been pre&s;ented from the Lieute|nancy of
<HI>London,</HI> and from <HI>Southwark,</HI> and 'tis wi&s;hed they may have
the good Effect they were intended for.</P>
<P>The Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> with the Court of Aldermen,
attended the King at <HI>Hampton-Court</HI> with a Petition from the Common
Coun|cil, de&s;iring his Maje&s;ty to a&s;&s;emble a Parlia|ment. The Lord
Chancellor, by the King's Command, gave them a very &s;evere Reprimand, telling
them, that the King wondered how they dur&s;t bring &s;uch a Paper to him in
Name of the City, when it was again&s;t the Sen&s;e of the be&s;t Part of the
City: That the King knew there were re&s;tle&s;s Spirits among&s;t them, and
would &s;et a Mark upon them; and that if they went on in tho&s;e Cour&s;es, he
would make them &s;en&s;ible of his Di&s;plea&s;ure. The 7th of <HI>July</HI>
1681, the Lord Mayor came again to <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> with a Petition of
the Common Coun|cil, and the Lord Chancellor gave them an An|&s;wer much like
the la&s;t. This Morning the Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> was taken by a Warrant
from Sir <HI>Lionel Jenkins,</HI> and his Trunks and Papers &s;eized, and both
he and they were car|ried before the Council, where he was exami|ned 
<PB N="324" REF="344"> &s;o privately, that all the Clerks of the Council were
turned out. It is &s;aid, he was taken upon the Information of Mr.
<HI>Haynes,</HI> Mr. <HI>Macknamarra,</HI> and <HI>Ivy,</HI> who, 'tis &s;aid,
corroborate the Te&s;timony <HI>Fitzharris</HI> gave to Mr. <HI>Hawkins,</HI>
among&s;t who&s;e Papers is found one of In&s;tructions or Directions to
<HI>Fitzharris,</HI> with &s;everal Heads of what he &s;hould plead, and what
he &s;hould &s;wear to. The Hand is very well known, and will be made publick.
The King was pre&s;ent at this extraordinary Council held at
<HI>Whitehall,</HI> where the Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> was brought in
Cu&s;tody of a Ser|geant at Arms, and was told there was a Charge of High
Trea&s;on again&s;t him, which would be proved by &s;everal Witne&s;&s;es;
whereupon he was committed to the <HI>Tower,</HI> and that Evening the Duke of
<HI>Monmouth,</HI> with &s;everal Lords, went to vi&s;it him, which
occa&s;ioned a greater Re&s;traint upon him; and he and my Lord <HI>Howard</HI>
are both clo&s;e Pri&s;oners, and only their Wives are permitted to come to
them.</P>
<P>The Proceedings this Se&s;&s;ion at the <HI>Old Baily</HI> were
very remarkable, mo&s;t of the Judges be|ing there, and many Per&s;ons of the
fir&s;t Qua|lity; as, the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> and &s;everal others. Mr.
<HI>Wallop</HI> and Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> pleaded hard for the <HI>Habeas
Corpus</HI> for the Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> and the Lord <HI>Howard:</HI>
But the <HI>Tower</HI> being a Pri&s;on out of the City, and their Meeting
being only a Se&s;&s;ion of <HI>Oyer</HI> and <HI>Ter|miner,</HI> the
<HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> could not lye in that Court. A Bill of Indictment was
then pre&s;en|ted <PB N="325" REF="345"> to the Grand Jury of the City of
<HI>London,</HI> again&s;t <HI>Colledge,</HI> the <HI>Prote&s;tant Joyner,</HI>
as he was always called. The Witne&s;&s;es again&s;t him were Mr.
<HI>Smith,</HI> Mr. <HI>Dugdale,</HI> Mr. <HI>Haynes,</HI> the two
<HI>Macknamara's,</HI> and Sir <HI>William Jen|nings.</HI> They all
po&s;itively &s;wore, that <HI>Colledge</HI> told them, there was a De&s;ign to
&s;eize the King at <HI>Oxford,</HI> and bring him to <HI>London,</HI> and
there keep him, till he had complied with them, or el&s;e to bring him to the
Block, as they did his Father; and that in this De&s;ign the Hou&s;e of Lords
and Commons were concerned, and that there was an Army ready at <HI>London</HI>
to a&s;&s;i&s;t them. It is certainly true, that never Men &s;wore more firmly
than they did in Court, be|fore the Jury, who demanded of the Court a Copy of
their Oaths, and that the Witne&s;&s;es might go with them, to be examined
apart; which Reque&s;t was granted to the Jury, and after two or three Hours
Con&s;ideration, the Jury returned, and found the Bill <HI>Ignoramus.</HI> Upon
which the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice demanded, whether they would give no Rea&s;on
for this Verdict; and whether they believed tho&s;e Six Witne&s;&s;es perjured?
To which they replied, That they had given their Verdict according to their
Con&s;ciences, and that they would &s;tand by it. To which the Lord Chief
Ju&s;tice <HI>North</HI> &s;aid, <HI>There was never &s;uch a Verdict brought
in the World.</HI> The Grand Jury, before they were di&s;charged, delivered a
Petition to the Court, de&s;iring the Removal of the Prie&s;ts and Je&s;uits
farther from the Lords in the <HI>Tower,</HI> they <PB N="326" REF="346">
holding Corre&s;pondence with them. Upon bringing in this Bill <HI>Ignoramus,
Colledge</HI> will be &s;ent to be tryed in <HI>Oxford,</HI> where the Judges
arrived the 15th of <HI>July.</HI> Their Commi&s;&s;ion was opened, and the
Grand Jury was &s;worn, of which Sir <HI>Thomas Spencer</HI> was Foreman; the
re&s;t were all Gentlemen of Loyalty, and Pro|te&s;tants, and of good
E&s;tates; and upon hearing the Evidence again&s;t <HI>Colledge,</HI> they
found the Indictment <HI>Billa vera, nemine contradicente.</HI> One of the
Evidence again&s;t him &s;wore, That if the King did not agree with his
Parliament, there was a De&s;ign to &s;eize upon him, and Thirty Thou&s;and Men
were ready in the City of <HI>London</HI> to back the De&s;ign; and that if the
King refu&s;ed to pa&s;s the Bill of Exclu&s;ion, they would &s;erve him as
they did his Father. This <HI>Colledge</HI> was brought to his Tryal at
<HI>Oxford,</HI> before the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>North</HI> and Ju&s;tice
<HI>Jones.</HI> The Tryal la&s;ted from Two in the Afternoon, till Two in the
Morning, &s;o much Time was taken up in examining the Wit|ne&s;&s;es. The
Evidence again&s;t the Pri&s;oner was the &s;ame which was at the
<HI>Old-Baily</HI>; tho&s;e for the Pri&s;oner were chiefly Mr. <HI>Oates, Mow
bray,</HI> and <HI>Waldron,</HI> who &s;aid, that <HI>Dug|dale</HI> and
<HI>Smith</HI> told them, they knew nothing again&s;t <HI>Colledge</HI>; but
they denied it upon their Oaths, and the Jury brought him in Guilty; and &s;ome
Hours after the Pri&s;oner received his Sentence, the Court meeting again for
that Purpo&s;e. Some Days after, <HI>Colledge</HI> was executed, and his Head
was &s;et <PB N="327" REF="347"> upon <HI>Temple-Bar,</HI> to be a Warning to
others to avoid his Fate.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Sidney</HI> in <HI>Holland</HI> finding that his
Maje|&s;ty was much &s;urprized at his having taken a Commi&s;&s;ion in
<HI>Holland,</HI> without his Leave, to be General of all the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Forces there, which hath been vacant &s;ince the Death of
the Earl of <HI>O&s;&s;ory,</HI> hath been per&s;waded by his Friends to

has the King's Leave to accept of the <HI>Scotch</HI> Regiment in
<HI>Holland,</HI> whereof <HI>Kilpatrick</HI> was Collonel, which the Prince of
<HI>Orange</HI> has offered him.</P>
<P>About this time the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> came for
<HI>England,</HI> and was very well received by the King and Court, and had
been &s;everal times in private with the King. Various Di&s;cour&s;es are
rai&s;ed about his Coming, and his Return will be very &s;udden. He hath been
&s;omething unlucky at Play, having lo&s;t in one Night, Three Thou|&s;and
Pounds at <HI>Ba&s;&s;et.</HI> His Highne&s;s, whil&s;t in <HI>London,</HI>
lodges at <HI>Arlington-Hou&s;e,</HI> where he hath been magnificently
entertained at the King's Charge, and hath been likewi&s;e treated very
&s;plendidly by the Duke of <HI>Albemarle.</HI> His Highne&s;s was al&s;o
invited to dine with the Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> and accepted the
Invitation, and great Preparations were made for his Re|ception; and as he was
preparing to dine in <HI>London,</HI> he received an Expre&s;s from his
Ma|je&s;ty to come pre&s;ently to <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> which he did, and the
Secretary of State carried his Ex|cu&s;e. <PB N="328" REF="348"> After this the
Lord Mayor &s;ent the two Sheriffs to invite his Highne&s;s to dine with him,

not many Hours before he left <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> a Cabinet Council was there
held concerning <HI>Flanders,</HI> wherein the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was
pre&s;ent; but the Rea&s;on of his Coming is &s;till kept very &s;ecret, which
none can tell. About this time the Lord Mayor carried up an Addre&s;s of the

Council. Sir <HI>John Shorter,</HI> Sir <HI>Robert Clayton,</HI> Mr.

<P><PB N="331" REF="351">The Se&s;&s;ions at <HI>Hickes</HI>'s

Chair|man, he objected again&s;t the Per&s;ons that were returned to &s;erve on
the Grand Jury, as being Di&s;&s;enters from the Church of <HI>England,</HI>
and required the Under-Sheriff to make a new Pan|nel of &s;ub&s;tantial good
Men; which he refu|&s;ing, the Court ordered the Sheriffs them&s;elves &s;hould
attend the next Day: But, in&s;tead of them, the Recorder of <HI>London</HI>
appeared, and told the Court, that the Sheriffs having ac|quainted the Court of
Aldermen with the Or|der, they were of Opinion, that the Privilege of the City
did exempt the Sheriffs from any Attendance at <HI>Hickes</HI>'s <HI>Hall</HI>;
and that it was &s;ufficient if the Under-Sheriff did their Bu&s;i|ne&s;s: But
the Court not allowing the Excu&s;e, for their Contempt, fined the two Sheriffs
One Hundred Pounds, and then adjourned, and re|&s;olved to acquaint the Judges
with the Matter. Mr. <HI>Wil&s;on,</HI> a Secretary to the Earl of

Conference with the Mini&s;ters, about the Affairs of <HI>Flanders.</HI> The

<HI>Whitehall,</HI> to invite the King to Dinner <PB N="332" REF="352"> on the

<P>In the Beginning of this Year, the <HI>Duc de Villa

<HI>Flan|ders,</HI> and to have the Di&s;po&s;ition of the Finan|ces and Money;

the Government to the <HI>Marquis de Grana</HI>; but this Matter was kept very
private, and the <HI>Marquis</HI> took a private Hou&s;e near the Court. The
<HI>Prince de Parma</HI> looking upon this as a very extraordinary Proceeding,
was re&s;olved to leave the Government, and u&s;ing each Evening to take the

prejudicial to &s;ome of their Privileges and Cu&s;toms, which were Matters of

unle&s;s they did, by the Time pre&s;cribed, voluntarily put into his

<P>By another good Hand from <HI>Whitehall,</HI> of the 25th of
<HI>June</HI> 1683, I am told, that Mr. <HI>We&s;t</HI> the Lawyer, and
Collonel <HI>Ram&s;ey,</HI> had &s;ur|rendered them&s;elves, and have been
examined, and confe&s;&s;ed the whole De&s;ign of killing the King and Duke, at
their late coming from <HI>New|market,</HI> of which by God's Providence they
were di&s;appointed. It is certain, a more diaboli|cal De&s;ign could never be
contrived, and the Ex|aminations already taken do plainly bring it to Light.
Ye&s;terday the Council met, and a Pro|clamation was ordered to be forthwith
i&s;&s;ued out, to tell all the World, that the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> the
Lord <HI>Grey,</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Arm&s;trong,</HI> and one
<HI>Fergu&s;on,</HI> are of the Number of the Con&s;pira|tors, and 500
<HI>L.</HI> is offered to &s;uch as &s;hall bring in any of them. If the Duke
of <HI>Monmouth</HI> be guilty of this Crime, &s;ure it is in him more than
High Trea&s;on, to which the greate&s;t Pu|ni&s;hments of human Laws are
a&s;&s;igned. Col|lonel <HI>Algernoon Sidney</HI> is &s;ent to the

The Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> and Mr. <HI>Trenchard</HI> are likewi&s;e &s;ent

to di&s;arm all di&s;&s;affected Per&s;ons, and a Committee of Lords were
&s;ent to the <HI>Tower,</HI> to examine Collonel <HI>Sidney.</HI></P>
<P>My Lord <HI>Grey</HI> was carrying to the <HI>Tower,</HI> who
made his E&s;cape ju&s;t at the <HI>Tower</HI> Gate, out of the Coach from the
Sergeant at Arms, who was all alone with him and his Servant. He went directly
to the Water Side, and pa&s;&s;ed over into <HI>Southwark.</HI> The Sergeant
was a&s;leep, or what is as bad, con&s;enting to it. He refu|&s;ed to have a
Guard of Soldiers, and will be pro&s;ecuted with all Severity. Major
<HI>Holmes,</HI> an <HI>Oliverian</HI> Officer, and one Mr. <HI>Baillie,</HI> a
<HI>Scotchman,</HI> are &s;ent to the <HI>Gate-hou&s;e</HI> for Trea|&s;on; and
<HI>Hone</HI> the Joyner is al&s;o &s;eized, who hath been examined: And tho'
he would not accu&s;e others, he hath confe&s;&s;ed enough to hang him&s;elf.

<P>The Grand Jury of <HI>London</HI> have found Bill of Indictment
again&s;t the&s;e Per&s;ons following <HI>Thomas Walcot, Richard Goodenough,
Richard</HI> <PB N="347" REF="369"> <HI>Rumbold, Nathaniel Wade, Richard
Nelthorp, Robert Fergu&s;on, William Thom&s;on, James Bur|ton, John Rou&s;e,

Hone, William Blague,</HI> Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> Lord <HI>Grey,</HI> Duke
of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Arm|&s;trong</HI>; and accordingly
<HI>Walcot, Rou&s;e, Hone,</HI> and <HI>Blague,</HI> were arraigned
immediately; and <HI>Walcot</HI> Being brought to his Tryal, after a long
Hearing, was found Guilty of High Trea&s;on by the Jury. He confe&s;s'd he was
not to have killed the King, but had engaged him&s;elf to oppo&s;e the Guards.
This Morning, being the 13th of <HI>July,</HI> the Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> and
<HI>Hone</HI> the Joyner, were brought to their Tryal, and found Guilty of High
Trea&s;on. At the &s;ame time the King being vi&s;iting a Fortification that
was making in the <HI>Tower,</HI> the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> withdrawing
into his Clo&s;et, cut his own Throat with his Razor, of which he died
im|mediately.</P>
<P>The 14th of <HI>July</HI> the Privy Council met, and the Lord
Mayor and Court of Aldermen attending, were &s;ent for into the Council, and
the Lord Chancellor told them, That the King had taken Notice of the irregular
Proceeding of the Common Hall about the Election of She|riffs, and the great
Di&s;orders occa&s;ioned there|by; and that, for the Prevention of farther
Mi&s;chief, his Maje&s;ty did command the Lord Mayor to begin the whole
Proceeding <HI>de novo,</HI> and that his Lord&s;hip &s;hould take great Care
to maintain the ancient Cu&s;toms of the City. <PB N="348" REF="370"> Whereupon
the Common Hall meeting, the Order of Council was read, and my Lord Mayor told
them, That, in Obedience to it, they were to begin their whole Proceedings
<HI>de novo,</HI> and accordingly Mr. <HI>North</HI> was put up to be
confirm'd, and the Lord Mayor declared him one of the Sheriffs. Then they were
to go to the Poll, which Sheriff <HI>Chute</HI> declared they did with a
<HI>&s;alvo Jure</HI> to their former Choice, and the Sheriffs had made a
Column in their Poll Bill, to Poll negatively again&s;t Mr. <HI>North</HI>'s
Confirmation, with which the Lord Mayor was &s;o un&s;atisfied, that he
ad|journed the Poll till the next Day, intending then his own Officers to take
the Poll.</P>
<P>The 20th of <HI>July, Walcot, Hone,</HI> and <HI>Rou&s;e</HI>
were executed at <HI>Tyburn,</HI> the fir&s;t of them mo&s;t remarkably
penitent, and hath made a Decla|ration under his Hand of many more Particu|lars
of his own and others Guilt in this hor|rid Con&s;piracy, than hath been yet
imputed to them. To morrow, the Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> will lo&s;e his Head
in <HI>Lincolns-Inn-Fields,</HI> of which I had this following Account from a
very good Hand at <HI>Whitehall. On</HI> Saturday <HI>the Lord</HI> Ru&s;&s;el
<HI>was brought to the Place of his Execu|tion in his own Coach, accompanied
with Dr.</HI> Tillot&s;on <HI>and Dr.</HI> Burnet. <HI>He behaved him&s;elf
with great Courage. The Execution being ended, a Speech was publi&s;hed by his
La|dy's Direction, wherein were &s;everal Reflecti|ons defaming the Ju&s;tice
of the Nation; and Dr.</HI> Burnet <HI>being &s;u&s;pected to have had a
Hand</HI> <PB N="349" REF="371"> <HI>in it, he was examined before the Council
about it; and one</HI> John&s;on, <HI>the late Lord</HI> Ru&s;&s;el<HI>'s
Chaplain, was examined, as well about the &s;aid Speech, as for &s;ome
Pa&s;&s;ages in the Life of</HI> Julian the Apo&s;tate, <HI>whereof he was the
Author. A Declaration containing an Account of the Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s of the
pre&s;ent Con&s;piracy, hath been read and approved in Council, and in
pur&s;uance of it, the</HI> 9<HI>th of</HI> September <HI>is appointed a Day of
&s;olemn Thank&s;giving in all Churches, for &s;o great a Deliverance.</HI> At
the &s;ame time I am, told from <HI>Whitehall,</HI> that Prince <HI>George</HI>
of <HI>Denmark</HI> was arrived; that he was a Per&s;on of a good Mein, and had
dined with the King, Queen, and Duke, who gave the Prince the upper Hand. The
Court will &s;oon return to <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> where the Marriage between the
Prince and Lady <HI>Anne</HI> will be con&s;ummated. His Pre&s;ents (which are
very noble) are pre|&s;ented to her, and their Families will be &s;ettled after
the Manner of the Duke's and Dutche&s;s's, but not &s;o numerous. A Chapter
will be held at <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> for chu&s;ing Prince <HI>George</HI> into
the mo&s;t noble Order of the Garter; but the Prince hath de&s;ired it may be
deferred, till he hath written to the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> for his Leave
to forbear wearing the Order of the Elephant, for that it would not be &s;eemly
to wear that and the Order of the Garter at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>The King's Declaration concerning the Plot gives great
Satisfaction, wherein the particular Steps and Methods of it were &s;et down;
and <PB N="350" REF="372"> Mr. <HI>Carlton,</HI> who is named in the King's
De|claration, is brought up from <HI>Oxford&s;hire,</HI> where he was &s;eized;

ex|amined by the Council, and is &s;till in the Me&s;|&s;enger's Hands, and is
putting in Writing what he knows of the Con&s;piracy, which is expected to be
very con&s;iderable, becau&s;e of his known Intimacy with the late Earl. The
pre&s;ent Earl, and the Lord <HI>A&s;hley</HI> his Son (who is a very hopeful
young Gentleman) have ki&s;&s;ed the King's Hand at <HI>Wind&s;or.</HI> The

not being &s;afe for him at this time, when &s;uch villainous De&s;igns are

<HI>Gladman,</HI> two <HI>Oliverian</HI> Officers, are both &s;eized upon

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOur la&s;t private Letter, as well as your publick one, were
read before his Maje&s;ty ye&s;terday in Council. Your An&s;wers to the
Go|vernour were well approved of, e&s;pecially that Article wherein you
ob&s;erved to him, That it is out of the Sphere of any foreign Mini&s;ters, to
take upon them to alledge, or make u&s;e of any Argument grounded upon the
Sentiment or De|&s;ires of the Subjects and Va&s;&s;als of the Prince 
<PB N="352" REF="374"> that a foreign Mini&s;ter &s;o alledging re&s;ides with:
For Example, would the King of <HI>Spain</HI> have taken it well, that Sir
<HI>Henry Goodrick</HI> &s;hould have urged, why he offered his Maje&s;ty's
Arbi|trage, the Sentiments or De&s;ires of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Nation,
either in their Provinces, or el&s;e in other Territories of the Catholick
King? Can <HI>Don Pedro de Ronquillos</HI> make it out, that the City of
<HI>London</HI> does de&s;ire, that his Maje&s;ty &s;hould embark in a War?
Does he know the Sentiments of the Council of <HI>Scotland</HI> and
<HI>Ire|land?</HI> Hath he put all the Sentiments of tho&s;e great Bodies into
a Balance? Does he know which among&s;t them will preponderate? There was a
Time (and 'tis within your Memory and mine) when not only foreign Mini&s;ters
with Character, but their very Clerks and <HI>Valets de Chambre</HI> did meddle
with our Affairs of State, and might (as they thought) with our publick
Councils. This was an Indignity upon the King, I hope it will be &s;o no more.
Sure I am of one thing, they did not do our Bu&s;ine&s;s, which they pretended
highly to do; if they have done their own, much good may it do them. You have
already all the Account I can give you of the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI>
&s;aving that ye&s;terday Evening, after Council, he came to my Office, and I
di&s;charged the Sergeant at Arms that had him in Cu&s;tody: Then I waited upon
him, as I had been ordered, to the Duke: The Duke car|ried him immediately to
the King. After his Examination, the King carried him to the Queen. Then the
Duke brought him back again to his <PB N="353" REF="375"> own Side, to the
Dutche&s;s, and he was all this Morning at Court. I am, Sir,</P>

<P>It &s;eems, the Lord Privy Seal, the Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI>
and &s;everal other Lords of the Privy Council, knowing for certain, that the
Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> was at Court, and had been well received and pardoned
by the King, went to vi&s;it the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> at the
<HI>Cock-pit</HI>; and &s;ome People had the Confidence to contra|dict what was
publi&s;hed concerning the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> tho' nothing was printed
con|cerning him, but by Order from the King, and Council, and entered
<HI>verbatim</HI> in the Council Book, that it might be kept in particular.
However, what was printed concerning the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> was the
Subject of much Di&s;cour&s;e, and the Whiggs and factious People had the
Impudence to &s;ay it was fal&s;e, and that the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> did
not make any Con|fe&s;&s;ion of the Con&s;piracy; and the Thing went &s;o far,
that Reports were &s;pread abroad, of Di&s;cour&s;es the Duke of
<HI>Monmouth</HI> had him&s;elf held to that Purpo&s;e, and that the printed
Re|lation was injurious to him; &s;o that there was a Nece&s;&s;ity that &s;ome
publick Notice &s;hould be taken of it, and that the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>
&s;hould vindicate the King's Honour as well as his own, by owning publickly
the Confe&s;&s;ion he had made to the King, in Pre&s;ence of his Royal
Highne&s;s, with which his Maje&s;ty was &s;o well <PB N="354" REF="376">
plea&s;ed, as not only to grant him his Pardon, which was to pa&s;s forthwith
under the Great Seal, but likewi&s;e gave him a con&s;iderable Sum of Money for
the Frankne&s;s of his Confe&s;&s;ion. But upon the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s
denying what was publi&s;hed concerning him, and ha|ving declared the &s;ame in
divers publick Places, and the Per&s;ons being &s;ent for and examined, they
declared, That they heard the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> him&s;elf deny that he
had made any &s;uch Confe&s;&s;ion of the Con&s;piracy; and the Factious
thereupon beginning to &s;hew them|&s;elves with great Confidence, it was
thought ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that publick Notice &s;hould be taken of
it. Whereupon the King required the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> to make a publick
De|claration either before the Council, or el&s;e to confe&s;s publickly what
he had declared and owned to his Maje&s;ty, when he was fir&s;t brought to the
King by his Royal Highne&s;s: But the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> then having his
Pardon un|der the Great Seal, and the Money which the King gave him, did
ab&s;olutely refu&s;e to con|form to what his Maje&s;ty &s;o ju&s;tly required
of him, and which the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> &s;hould not have made the
lea&s;t Scruple of doing. The King was &s;o highly offended at the Duke's
re|fu&s;ing to perform &s;o nece&s;&s;ary a Part of his Du|ty, that he
forthwith ordered Mr. Vice-Cham|berlain <HI>Saville,</HI> to &s;ignify to him
his Maje&s;ty's Plea&s;ure, That he &s;hould not any more come into the King's
Pre&s;ence, and that he &s;hould pre&s;ently leave the Court; which the Duke 
<PB N="355" REF="377"> of <HI>Monmouth</HI> did, and took a little Hou&s;e in
<HI>Holbourn,</HI> to the A&s;toni&s;hment of all Men that had any Duty for the
King or Government. Upon this the Whiggs and factious People made it the great
Subject of all their Di&s;cour&s;es: Whereupon the King was plea&s;ed to
declare publickly, That the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> did confe&s;s to him, in
Pre&s;ence of the Duke, all the Plot, and did repeat to him all the
con&s;ide|rable Particulars &s;worn by the Witne&s;&s;es, and did a&s;&s;ure
the King, that what the Lord <HI>Howard</HI> of <HI>E&s;crick</HI> had &s;worn
again&s;t <HI>Algernoon Sidney,</HI> was true; and that he was one of the
mo&s;t dangerous Men to the Government in his Ma|je&s;ty's Dominions: And yet,
at the &s;ame time, &s;everal Per&s;ons of Credit depo&s;ed, That they had
heard the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> di&s;own what was publi&s;hed about him,
and refu&s;ed to make a publick Declaration of what he had confe&s;&s;ed and
owned to the King.</P>
<P>Soon after this, the King was plea&s;ed to ac|quaint the Lords
of his Council, That having received the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> into his
Mer|cy, and having &s;ince heard &s;everal Reports from the Duke's own Servants
and others, that the Duke had made no Confe&s;&s;ion to his Maje&s;ty of the
Con&s;piracy, nor owned any Share he had in it: The King did therefore think
fit, for the Vindication of the Truth of what the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> had
declared to him and the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> to require the &s;ame from him
in wri|ting a Letter under his own Hand, which the &s;aid Duke of
<HI>Monmouth</HI> refu&s;ed to do in the Terms <PB N="356" REF="378"> it was
commanded him: His Maje&s;ty was &s;o much offended therewith, that he had
forbid him his Pre&s;ence, and commanded him to depart the Court: And for the
farther Information of the Council, his Maje&s;ty had directed the Letter that
the Duke had been required to &s;ign, to be entered in the Council Book,
declaring he did not intend it &s;hould be a Secret. The Letter was as
follows.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>I Have heard &s;ome Reports of me, as if I &s;hould have
le&s;&s;ened the late Plot, and have gone about to di&s;credit the Evidence
again&s;t tho&s;e that have died by Ju&s;tice. Your Maje&s;ty and the Duke know
how ingenuou&s;ly I have owned the late Con&s;piracy; and tho' I was not
con&s;cious of any De&s;ign again&s;t your Maje&s;ty's Life, yet I lament the
having a great Hand in the other Part of the Con&s;piracy, which was the
Confederacy. Sir, I have taken the Liberty to put this in Wri|ting, for my own
Vindication, and I be&s;eech you to look forward, and endeavour to forget the
Fault you have forgiven me, and I will take Care, never to commit any more
again&s;t you, nor to come within the Danger of being again mi&s;led from my
Duty, but &s;hall make it the Bu&s;ine&s;s of my whole Life to de&s;erve the
Pardon your Ma|je&s;ty hath given to</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The King having made this Declaration con|cerning the Duke of
<HI>Monmouth</HI> to the Council, cau&s;ed it to be entered in the Council
Book, <PB N="357" REF="379"> that Copies might be taken of it, which gave a
general and great Satisfaction; whereas many before began to be &s;taggered
with the Reports that were with &s;o much Confidence, or rather Impudence,
&s;pread abroad; and the great Won|der was, why the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>
&s;hould refu&s;e to give the King and the World the Sa|tisfaction of &s;igning
the above-written Paper. The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> declared upon going from
his Hou&s;e in <HI>Holbourn,</HI> that he would re|tire privately to his
Hou&s;e in <HI>Moore Park,</HI> but none know (at lea&s;t publickly) where he
now is; and I have been told from a good Hand at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> that he
had written a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Let|ter to the King, but not being in the Terms
his Maje&s;ty expected, he would take no Notice of it.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Algernoon Sidney</HI> will executed the next Week, the
Warrant being &s;igned for his Execution, and the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice hath
committed two Per&s;ons to <HI>Newgate,</HI> for u&s;ing &s;ome &s;candalous
Expre&s;&s;ions concerning Mr. <HI>Sid|ney</HI>'s Tryal and Jury, it being fit
that &s;ome &s;hould be made Examples, to teach others to govern their Tongues.
On the 7th of <HI>Decem|ber,</HI> Mr. <HI>Sidney</HI> was beheaded. He came on
Foot from the <HI>Tower</HI> to the Scaffold upon <HI>Tower Hill</HI>: He there
&s;aluted the People, and gave the Sheriffs a Paper, which he de&s;ired might
be communicated to the World; and kneeling down, he prayed to him&s;elf for
&s;ome Minutes, and then ri&s;ing undre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf. The She|riffs
a&s;ked him, if he had nothing to &s;ay? who <PB N="358" REF="380"> an&s;wered,
he had nothing to &s;ay or to do, but to die: And being undre&s;&s;ed, and
putting on his Cap, he laid him&s;elf down, and bid the Executioner do his
Duty, who &s;truck off his Head at one Blow. The Sheriffs carried the Paper to
the King, which was an Invective again&s;t the Government, his Judges, Jury,
and Witne&s;&s;es, and concludes with this Expre&s;&s;ion, That he <HI>doubts
not but God Almighty will con|tinue to own the Cau&s;e for which he died.</HI>
He &s;hewed a great Courage and Unconcernedne&s;s for Death; but it is to be
wi&s;hed he had &s;hewed a more Chri&s;tian Temper. He had no Mini&s;ter with
him, having a Religion of his own, and his Paper may be ju&s;tly called, a very
venemous Libel: He &s;eems to ju&s;tify the la&s;t Rebellion, and prayed God
&s;till to &s;upport the Old Cau&s;e, for which he appeared &s;o eminently
heretofore. It is certain, that he carried his dete&s;table Princi|ples
again&s;t Monarchy and the e&s;tabli&s;hed Go|vernment with him to his Grave,

<P>THE Letter you &s;ent me by Mr. <HI>Puckle,</HI> and tho&s;e

An&s;wer to it by Word of Mouth, to <HI>Don Pedro,</HI> but &s;trictly
commanded not to give it in Writing, or to dictate it, that he might take a
Copy, which I did punctually ob&s;erve; which gave him great Di&s;ta&s;te. I
&s;end you the Words as near as I can, but with this &s;trict Injunction from
the King, that you do not communicate them to any Per&s;on; for then that which
we refu&s;ed them will come to them another Way. The An|&s;wer is communicated

<P>In the Beginning of the Year following, the Court of King's
Bench gave Judgment in the great Ca&s;e of the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Company,
and were unanimou&s;ly of Opinion, that Judgment ought to be given for the
Plaintiffs, which are the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Company. Their Arguments were
all re&s;olved into the&s;e two Que&s;tions: Fir&s;t, Whether the Grant of a
&s;ole Trade to the Company, without Prohibition to all the re&s;t of the
King's Subjects not to trade to tho&s;e Parts, be a good Grant? Secondly,
Suppo&s;e the Grant be good, whether this Action be maintainable? And the whole
Court held in the Affirmative to both: And, that in the Fir&s;t Point, as well
the prohibitory as the enabling Part, were con&s;i&s;tent both with the Laws of
the Land, and the Law of Nations: Which the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice made out with
much painful Learning, by citing many Authorities and Precedents out of the
Parliament Rolls and foreign Books, whereby he proved that <HI>Jus Gentium</HI>
mu&s;t be the Judge of foreign Trade, <PB N="367" REF="389"> by which it was at
fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed, as it is re|gulated in all other Nations. As to the
Obje|ction, that this excluding Grant was a Mono|poly, he di&s;tingui&s;hed
upon the Word, proving out of &s;everal Books of the Civil Law, that Monopolies
are of two Sorts, either Lawful, as when the Prince grants to any College a
&s;ole Trade exclu&s;ive of all other Per&s;ons: Or Un|lawful, according to the
vulgar Acceptation of the Word; and that this Grant is of the for|mer Sort, and
not &s;uch a Monopoly as the Law condemns. The Court held, That the Statute of
<HI>Edw.</HI> III. pleaded by the Defendant, had Relation only to the Trade of
the Staple, and could not be intended to controul this, which was not then in
Being. Yet, &s;uppo&s;ing the Sta|tute were powerful, and gave Licence to all
Per&s;ons to trade every where; yet the King having, by the common Law, a Power
of re|&s;training his Subjects from trading, and there being no expre&s;s Words
in the Statute, to take away this Power, the Statute, as to that, is void,
according to the Rule &s;et down by my Lord <HI>Cook,</HI> that, without
expre&s;s Words, no Prerogative &s;hall be taken away. The Court &s;aid
further, That tho' the King had covenan|ted with the Company, to grant no
Licences to any other Per&s;ons of a concurrent Trade; yet the King hath not
hereby concluded him|&s;elf, but that he may, at his Plea&s;ure, licen&s;e any
of his Subjects to trade to the Places men|tioned in the Charter.</P>

you this particular Account for your Satisfaction.</P>

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN your la&s;t, which was read ye&s;terday before the King and
Council, you are plea&s;ed to de|&s;ire to know the King's Plea&s;ure, whether
you &s;hould go into the Campaign with that Governour. His Maje&s;ty
re&s;olved, that it was not nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e the Scene of the War in
that Country being like to be of a very narrow Compa&s;s, and not far from the
Place where you have always re&s;ided, which being the Capital of that
Coun|try, will &s;till have the be&s;t Share in the Intelli|gence. One thing
that concerns my &s;elf I &s;hall take Leave to impart to you with a very
&s;incere Joy: It is, That his Maje&s;ty hath, upon my mo&s;t humble, and even
importunate Suit, given me Leave, in regard of my ill Health, to re&s;ign my
Po&s;t of Secretary, and hath be&s;towed it up|on Mr. <HI>Godolphin,</HI> in
who&s;e Corre&s;pondence, as far as it will take in your Deportment, you will,
I am &s;ure, be very happy. My great Concern is, that this being a pure Effect
of my mo&s;t hum|ble Supplication, and even intolerable Importu|nity with his
Maje&s;ty and the Duke, it may not be imputed to any Surprize upon me at Court,
much le&s;s to my di&s;liking of the pre&s;ent Mea&s;ures there. This I &s;ay,
becau&s;e I know the Fanaticks will put the mo&s;t malicious Con&s;tructions
they can invent upon an Incident at Court: But, up|on my hone&s;t Word, Sir, it
is my utter Di&s;abi|lity to &s;erve, and that alone, which hath pre|vailed
upon his Maje&s;ty's infinite Clemency and Goodne&s;s, to con&s;ent to my
Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, with &s;uch <PB N="373" REF="395"> Marks of his Grace and
Royal Bounty, as to me are unexpre&s;&s;ible. This I thought it my Duty to
impart to you, to prevent Mi&s;information, and to let you know, at the &s;ame
time, that I &s;hall be glad, in what private Capacity &s;oever I am, to
approve my &s;elf in Truth and Effect, Sir,</P>

to inform my &s;elf of his Maje&s;ty's Plea&s;ure in Mr. <HI>Hulft</HI>'s
Bu&s;ine&s;s. His Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to tell me, That he had a good
Cha|racter of Mr. <HI>Hulft</HI> a good while &s;ince; and that whenever he
comes into <HI>England,</HI> whether with a publick Character, or in a private

<P>I Have often pitied you very heartily, under the intolerable
Pains you take, in writing &s;o many Letters with your own Hand. I mu&s;t now,
in Con&s;cience, not only pray you, but in a manner require you, to ea&s;e your

<P><PB N="376" REF="398">The 20th of <HI>May</HI> 1684, I had this
following Letter from a very good Hand.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am &s;ure that the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador hath
been &s;poken to, concerning the Treatment which they gave the Duke of
<HI>Monmouth</HI> at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> and has been given to under&s;tand
the great Re&s;entment the King hath of their Pro|ceedings. Hereupon the
<HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador has taken an Occa&s;ion to &s;peak to the
King, a&s;&s;uring him, that the Civilities which were &s;hewed him at
<HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> were purely in re&s;pect to his Maje&s;ty, as being his
Son; of which I am told the King took hold, and hath cau&s;ed a Letter to be
written to the Amba&s;&s;ador, to let that Court know the little Satisfaction
his Ma|je&s;ty hath in their treating the Duke of <HI>Mon|mouth</HI> as they
have done; and yet the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador continues his
In&s;tances, tho' he knows they cannot &s;ucceed to his Satisfaction. For he
that a&s;keth a Thing that cannot be granted, without the great Prejudice of
him that is to grant it, cannot certainly think to obtain what he de&s;ires,
and has not &s;o much Cau&s;e to be di&s;|&s;atisfied, when refu&s;ed, as he
hath, of whom he de&s;ires a Thing to his Prejudice. I &s;uppo&s;e it will be
no News to tell you, that the <HI>French</HI> King hath given A&s;&s;urances,
that after the Ta|king of <HI>Luxenburgh,</HI> he will not attempt any thing
farther in <HI>Flanders.</HI> The <HI>Count d'Araux</HI> hath declared thus
much at the <HI>Hague,</HI> upon <PB N="377" REF="399"> which it is not doubted
but the <HI>States</HI> will re|&s;olve to &s;it &s;till, and let the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> manage the War, as they will, if they will not comply with
the <HI>French</HI> Propo&s;als. We have no News from my Lord
<HI>Dartmouth</HI> at <HI>Tangier,</HI> expecting that he is coming home, and
will be &s;peedily in <HI>England.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> is highly
care&s;&s;ed at the <HI>Hague,</HI> which would make me wonder what the Prince
of <HI>Orange</HI> aims at by &s;uch a Proceeding. The King was plea&s;ed to
de|clare in the la&s;t Council at <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> that he thought fit
that his Royal Highne&s;s &s;hould be pre&s;ent at the Meeting of the Council,
and ac|cordingly the Duke took his Place at the Board, as Fir&s;t Prince of the
Blood.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>I am told from a good Hand, that the King hath forbid all
Corre&s;pondence with the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and hath declared to the
Nobility, and others attending him, that they &s;hould hold no Commerce with
the Prince, who hath given the old <HI>Hoffe,</HI> where the Prince&s;s his
Grandmother lived, at the <HI>Hague,</HI> to the Duke of <HI>Monmouth.</HI> We
expect daily a publick Ac|count of the Di&s;covery lately made in
<HI>Scotland,</HI> it being as plain as the Day, that the Con&s;pi|racy was
&s;o laid between the Rebels here and in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as to make an
In&s;urrection in both Kingdoms at the &s;ame time; upon which many Gentlemen,
whom they call Lairds, are com|mitted to Pri&s;on; it appearing that the
De&s;ign of the Con&s;piracy was to have &s;urprized <HI>Berwick,</HI> and
thereby have opened their Way to <HI>New-ca&s;tle.</HI> <PB N="378" REF="400">
By the Depo&s;ition of one <HI>Car&s;tairs,</HI> who was taken in
<HI>England,</HI> and &s;ent to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and by &s;everal others, the
Corre&s;pondence is made &s;o plain between the Con&s;pirators here and in
<HI>Scotland,</HI> that there is no farther Doubt made of it, it being
&s;ufficiently made appear. But at the &s;ame time it is worthy Remark, that
all their Credit in <HI>Scotland</HI> could not rai&s;e Thirty Thou&s;and
Pounds to carry on their Plot. I am told from a good Hand, that
<HI>Danvers</HI> who is now in the <HI>Gazette,</HI> was the Author of that
damna|ble Libel about the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> being a Parcel of Lies
and Forgeries maliciou&s;ly put together, to per&s;wade the Whiggs and the
Ignorant, that the then Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> was murdered by Order from
the Government, when it was apparent that he cut his own Throat. Circular
Letters have been written by the King's Commands, to all the Lords Lieutenants
of the Counties of this Kingdom, to this Effect: That the King being informed
Reports were &s;pread abroad in the Country, that his Maje&s;ty intended to
call a Parliament, and that many Gentlemen have thereupon begun to make
Intere&s;ts to be cho|&s;en, his Maje&s;ty had thought fit to let them know,
that he has not at pre&s;ent any Intention to call a Parliament; and when he
&s;hall find it ne|ce&s;&s;ary for his Service and the publick Good, to call
one, he will cau&s;e timely Notice to be given thereof; and in the mean time,
commands them to take Care to &s;uppre&s;s all &s;uch fal&s;e Reports, and to
puni&s;h the Authors of them. And his Maje&s;ty being informed, that Endeavours
have <PB N="379" REF="401"> been u&s;ed to promote a tumultuary Petition for
the Sitting of Parliament, his Maje&s;ty com|mands them to cru&s;h &s;uch
&s;editious Practices, tending to the great Di&s;turbance of the Go|vernment
and the publick Peace, and to enquire for the Authors and Promoters of
them.</P>
<P>There are in <HI>London</HI> about Sixty Companies, of which
Fourty and more have already &s;ur|rendered their Charters to his Maje&s;ty,
who hath been plea&s;ed to grant them new ones, with &s;uch Alterations and
Limitations as the King thinks nece&s;&s;ary for his Service; and tho&s;e
Companies which do yet &s;tand out, will be proceeded again&s;t in another
Way.</P>
<P>I am told from a very good Hand at <HI>White|hall,</HI> by
Letter of the 13th of <HI>June</HI> 1684, That the Duke's Coun&s;el let Mr.
<HI>Oates</HI> in the <HI>King's Bench</HI> Pri&s;on know, that there was a
Declaration filed again&s;t him on the Part of the Duke, for fal&s;e and
&s;candalous Words, and that if he pleaded not, Judgment &s;hould be entered
again&s;t him by Default. He replied, according to his in&s;olent Manner, That,
as he had never loved the Duke, &s;o he did not fear him, and that he would
an&s;wer the Declara|tion when he thought fit; and that, for the entering
Judgment by Default, he could not, for he would &s;tay in Pri&s;on, till there
was a Parliament, and then he &s;hould come out, and others would be in his
Place. Upon this, the Duke's Coun&s;el moved at the King's Bench Bar, That if
<HI>Oates</HI> &s;uffered Judgment to be entered by Default, in this Action of
the Duke, the <PB N="380" REF="402"> Court would then grant a Writ of Enquiry
of Damages to be executed at the Bar. The Aim of the Duke's Coun&s;el in
de&s;iring this, is, that the Matter they charge <HI>Oates</HI> with may be
laid open to the World, by having the Witne&s;&s;es examined in open Court.</P>
<P>The Yacht that brought over Sir <HI>Thomas Arm&s;trong</HI>
being arrived at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> he was brought on Shore by Captain
<HI>Richard&s;on,</HI> the Keeper of <HI>Newgate,</HI> who put Shackles upon
him, and brought him to <HI>Whitehall,</HI> where he hath been examined by a
Committee of Lords, but would confe&s;s nothing. It &s;eems Mr.
<HI>Chud|leigh</HI> having Notice, that Seven or Eight <HI>Eng|li&s;hmen</HI>
were come to <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> he &s;ent his Secretary, who di&s;covered them
at <HI>Delft,</HI> and followed them to <HI>Leyden</HI>; and having lodged them
there, he applied him&s;elf to the Scout, in Pur&s;uance of an Order Mr.
<HI>Chudleigh</HI> had obtained &s;ome time before of the States; and having
the Scout's A&s;&s;i&s;tance, he went to the Hou&s;e where they were, and
&s;eized <HI>Arm&s;trong</HI> without any Oppo&s;ition. The others with him
were not meddled with, for that they were not mentioned in the Order of the
States. <HI>Arm&s;trong</HI> was carried to Mr. <HI>Chudleigh</HI>'s Hou&s;e at
the <HI>Hague,</HI> and from thence on board the Yacht at <HI>Rotterdam.</HI>
Since his coming to <HI>London,</HI> he hath been brought to the King's Bench,
where Execution was prayed again&s;t him: But he pleaded a Statute of
<HI>Edward</HI> VI. which &s;ays, if a Per&s;on outlawed yield him&s;elf within
a Year and Day, he &s;hall be admitted to a Tryal: <PB N="381" REF="403"> But
he was an&s;wered, he did not yield him|&s;elf, but was brought in by Force,
and &s;o could not claim the Benefit of that Statute. He re|plied, the King had
allowed <HI>Holloway</HI> (who was likewi&s;e outlawed) the Liberty to
rever&s;e the Outlawry, and to &s;tand a Tryal, and hoped he &s;hould not be
denied it. He was an&s;wered by the Judges, that was the King's particular
Grace and Mercy, of which they were not the Di&s;pen&s;ers; and that there
remained nothing for them to do, but to order his Execution, which they did
accordingly. He did not &s;eem inclined to make any Confe&s;&s;ion, nor to have
the Sen&s;e that a Man ought to have that had Guilt upon him. After this, a
Motion was made on his Behalf, in the Court of Chancery, for a Writ of Error to
rever&s;e the Outlawry: But my Lord Keeper an&s;wered, he could not grant it
without Mr. Attorney's Con&s;ent, who &s;aid he had no Directions to con&s;ent
to it. One would think Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> ought not to expect any Mercy or
Favour from the King, to whom he hath been &s;o ungrateful. But I mu&s;t not
for|get to tell you, that when he was taken, he dropt &s;ome Papers into a
Hou&s;e of Office, but they were found, and among&s;t them were Let|ters from
the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> to the Sieur <HI>Dien,</HI> the
<HI>Brandenburgh</HI> Mini&s;ter at the <HI>Hague,</HI> and another to one of
the States, recommend|ing Sir <HI>Thomas Arm&s;trong</HI> to them in the mo&s;t
pre&s;&s;ing Manner imaginable. He was executed at <HI>Tyburn,</HI> drawn
thither from <HI>Newgate</HI> upon a Sledge. He &s;aluted &s;everal People as
he <PB N="382" REF="404"> went. He had Dr. <HI>Tenni&s;on</HI> to pray with
him, and died with much Courage and Re&s;olution. His Head will be put up over
the <HI>Gate-hou&s;e</HI> at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> and his Quarters will be
di&s;|po&s;ed of in like manner. One of his Quarters will be &s;ent to
<HI>Stafford,</HI> for which Place he was a Burge&s;s in Parliament. By his
Paper which he gave the Sheriff, he ju&s;tifies his In|nocency, and complains
that he had not a Tryal.</P>
<P>After Sir <HI>Thomas</HI>'s Execution, the Paper he gave the
Sheriffs was fir&s;t brought to the King, and his Maje&s;ty gave it again to
the Sheriffs, with Liberty to publi&s;h it. In it he di&s;owns to know of any
Plot again&s;t the King's Per&s;on and Government, and a&s;&s;erts his
Innocency to tho&s;e Matters. He ju&s;tified him&s;elf of what was reported of
him, of betraying the King in <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Time. He declared, he died a
Mem|ber of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> but confe&s;&s;ed he had not lived
according to her Rules and Doctrines. He &s;aid, he died ju&s;tly for the ma|ny
Sins he had committed in his Life-time, and de&s;ired tho&s;e he had injured to
forgive him, as he forgave every Body.</P>
<P>About this time was <HI>Oates</HI>'s, Tryal with the Duke, where
no le&s;s than Ten Witne&s;&s;es &s;wore, That <HI>Oates</HI> had &s;aid, his
Royal Highne&s;s was <HI>a Traitor, a Ra&s;cal, a Devil, the Son of a
Whore,</HI> with other Words not fit to be named, were it not to &s;hew the
audacious In&s;olence of <HI>Oates,</HI> who may po&s;&s;ibly e'er long be
called to an Account for many other things. Mr. <HI>Wil|liams,</HI> 
<PB N="383" REF="405"> late Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Commons, had a
Declaration filed again&s;t him, for having cau&s;ed &s;everal Papers, called
Votes and Ad|dre&s;&s;es of the Hou&s;e of Commons, to be prin|ted and
publi&s;hed, wherein were many &s;can|dalous Reflections upon his Maje&s;ty and
his Government; of which the &s;aid Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> having Notice, he did
not appear in <HI>We&s;tmin|&s;ter-hall</HI> the la&s;t Day of the Term, which
he never mi&s;&s;ed before.</P>
<P>I was told from a good Hand at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> by Letters of
the 30th of <HI>June</HI> 1684, That the Lord Trea&s;urer of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
with &s;everal other Lords of that Kingdom, were come to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Court, to complain again&s;t the Chancellor of <HI>Scotland:</HI> That the King
and Duke had heard their Complaints, which they found &s;o well grounded, that
the Great Seal was taken from the Chancellor, who&s;e Name is Sir <HI>George
Gordon,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Perth</HI> was con&s;tituted Lord Chancellor
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the Place he had of Ju&s;tice General was given to
the Earl of <HI>Linlithgow,</HI> Collonel of the Guards, and the &s;aid
Regiment of Guards was given to Collonel <HI>Douglas,</HI> Brother to the Lord
Trea&s;urer, the Marque&s;s of <HI>Queensborough,</HI> who has at pre&s;ent a
<HI>Scotch</HI> Regiment in Service of the States General; and Matters being
thus &s;ettled, the Lords are returning home again very well &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>I am told by a good Hand from <HI>Whitehall,</HI> That Sir
<HI>Gabriel Sylvius</HI> being returning for <HI>Holland,</HI> is charged with
a Me&s;&s;age from the <PB N="384" REF="406"> King to the Prince of
<HI>Orange:</HI> That the King con&s;idering the ill Circum&s;tances that
Prince had put him&s;elf into, the King had writ late|ly to the Prince, to
a&s;&s;ure him of his Kindne&s;s, and that he would do all he could to
&s;upport him. To which the Per&s;on that writes tells me, that the Prince of
<HI>Orange</HI> returned a very cold and indifferent An&s;wer; and which is
much wondered at, that the Prince &s;hould &s;hew &s;uch Kindne&s;s to the Duke
of <HI>Monmouth</HI> and the Lord <HI>Brandon,</HI> which neither the King nor
Duke can take well from the Prince. I am told from the &s;ame Hand, That the
King had taken Notice to the Envoy of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> of the great
Re&s;pect and Kindne&s;s which is &s;hewed to the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> at
<HI>Berlin</HI>; and his Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, he did not think the
Elector would have given that Coun|tenance to one that was in his Disfavour.
But the Mini&s;ter, to excu&s;e the Elector, &s;aid his Electoral Highne&s;s,
in the Re&s;pect he had &s;hewed to the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> did it as to
his Maje&s;ty's Son, and not to him as Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>; who is &s;o
highly care&s;&s;ed at the <HI>Hague,</HI> that it is thought the Prince will
make him General of all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Forces, and of all other his
Maje&s;ty's Subjects that are in the States Service; with which his Maje&s;ty
is &s;o highly di&s;&s;atisfied, that, perhaps, at Mr. <HI>Chud|leigh</HI>'s
Return to the <HI>Hague,</HI> his Maje&s;ty's Re|&s;entment may appear more
publick.</P>
<P>I am told, there hath lately happened a very unlucky Accident at
<HI>Norwich,</HI> betwixt <PB N="385" REF="407"> Mr. <HI>Bedingfield</HI> and
Mr. <HI>Barney</HI>; the fir&s;t a Man of a very good E&s;tate, and the other
an ancient Baronet; and &s;ome Words having pa&s;&s;ed between them at a
Gentleman's Hou&s;e, <HI>Barney</HI> came behind <HI>Bedingfield,</HI> and
&s;tabbed him in the Back, of which he died pre&s;ently. The Se&s;&s;ions being
then there, he was tryed, con|victed, and condemned, and was executed at the
Market Cro&s;s, the Fact being &s;o foul, that all Sollicitations for his Life
were ineffectual. I am told from <HI>Whitehall,</HI> that the King had named
Mr. <HI>Brisbane,</HI> late Secretary of the Ad|miralty, to go in Quality of
his Maje&s;ty's En|voy Extraordinary to the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> in the
Room of Mr. <HI>Fan&s;haw,</HI> who was recalled; but Mr. <HI>Brisbane</HI>
falling &s;ick at <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> is &s;ince dead.</P>
<P>By Letters of the 25th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1684, I am told,
that the King had thought fit to re|move the Earl of <HI>Radnor</HI> from the
Pre&s;ident|&s;hip of the Council, his Maje&s;ty's Plea&s;ure be|ing therein
&s;ignified to his Lord&s;hip by a Let|ter from the Secretary of State, with an
A&s;&s;urance of the King's entire Satisfaction in his Services, and that his
Maje&s;ty, as a Mark of it, would continue to him his Pen&s;ion which he had as
Lord Pre&s;ident. The Lord <HI>Radnor</HI>'s An&s;wer was full of Duty and
Sub|mi&s;&s;ion to the King; who was &s;o well plea&s;ed with it, that he
ordered the Lords of the Trea|&s;ury to take particular Care of the Payment of
the &s;aid Pen&s;ion: And his Maje&s;ty cau&s;ed the Earl of
<HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> to be &s;worn Lord Pre&s;i|dent <PB N="386" REF="408"> of
the Council; and al&s;o acquainted the Lords, that his Intention was, that Mr.
<HI>Godol|phin</HI> &s;hould be made an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Baron, by the Name
of Baron <HI>Godolphin</HI> of <HI>Godolphin,</HI> and &s;ucceed the Lord
<HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> in the Place of Fir&s;t Commi&s;&s;ioner of the
Trea&s;ury: That the Earl of <HI>Middleton,</HI> late one of the Secretaries of
State of <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;hould &s;ucceed Mr. <HI>Godolphin</HI> in that
of Secretary of State of <HI>England,</HI> who was &s;worn accordingly; and
that the King had given the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> Sixteen Thou&s;and
Pounds, to be rai&s;ed out of the Lord <HI>Grey</HI>'s E&s;tate: Which Changes
were made by the King to the Satisfaction of all Parties concerned.</P>
<P>I was told from a good Hand at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> that the Duke
of <HI>Grafton</HI> was gone incognito into <HI>Holland,</HI> and would from
thence go to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> to meet with his Brother the Duke of
<HI>Northumberland,</HI> and then return together, after having &s;een the
Governour of <HI>Flanders,</HI> and &s;poken with the Re&s;ident at
<HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> which they both did, but could not perform what they
intended. The &s;ame Per&s;on told me, that the Di&s;covery made in
<HI>Scotland,</HI> by the decy|phering of <HI>Argyle</HI>'s Letters, which were
owned by his Secretary, are of great Importance; which make the late horrid
Con&s;piracy &s;o evi|dent, that none can doubt of it. It &s;eems this
Secretary was Pri&s;oner in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and was charged with a Letter
from <HI>Argyle,</HI> which was found about him when he was taken, and a
Per&s;on at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> did decypher it. The Se|cretary at fir&s;t
denied it; but after having &s;e|veral <PB N="387" REF="409"> times endured the
Torture called the <HI>Boot,</HI> he had at la&s;t owned the Letter to be truly
de|cyphered, and confe&s;&s;ed &s;everal Particulars, which make the
Con&s;piracy as plain as Noon-Day. Upon this Di&s;covery, the Laird of
<HI>Monroe</HI> and &s;everal others are apprehended in <HI>Scotland</HI>; and
<HI>Monroe</HI> being threatened with the Torture, hath confe&s;&s;ed all, and
hath con|firmed what was evidenced by others, de&s;igning to make an
In&s;urrection in <HI>Scotland</HI> at the &s;ame time it was to be in
<HI>England. Monroe</HI> is bring|ing up to <HI>London,</HI> having made a very
large Confe&s;&s;ion. He hath attempted, with the Hor|ror of his Guilt, to
de&s;troy him&s;elf, and there|fore is looked after more clo&s;ely. After this
<HI>Monroe</HI>'s Arrival, <HI>Argyle</HI>'s Letters, and the Confe&s;&s;ion of
his Secretary and others, will be made publick, to convince World of the
helli&s;h De&s;igns of the Con&s;pirators again&s;t the King and Government:
Tho' one would think there &s;hould be none that needs be convinced, after the
plain Proofs that have already been given of them. It appears, that the
De&s;ign of the Con&s;pirators was to have &s;urprized <HI>Berwick,</HI> and
thereby to have opened their Way to <HI>New|ca&s;tle,</HI> where the Plot hath
been al&s;o di&s;cove|red: For the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Jeffries</HI> being
upon the Bench. Information was given him, that &s;everal con&s;iderable
Per&s;ons of that Town had &s;igned an A&s;&s;ociation for reforming the
Abu&s;es of the Government in Church and State: That the Original of this
A&s;&s;ociation was burnt, upon Di&s;covery of the Plot again&s;t 
<PB N="388" REF="410"> the King and Duke: But a Copy was produced to the Lord
Chief Ju&s;tice, and one that &s;igned the Original, &s;wore it to be a true
Copy: Up|on which Sixteen or Seventeen principal Per|&s;ons of that Place were
apprehended and com|mitted to Pri&s;on for High Trea&s;on, before the
A&s;&s;izes were there ended; and &s;ince the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice
<HI>Jeffries</HI>'s Return, he hath given an Account thereof to the King: As
al&s;o, that many Corporations in his Circuit had &s;ubmit|ted their Charters
to &s;uch Alterations as his Maje&s;ty hath thought nece&s;&s;ary for
&s;ecuring the Government in good and loyal Hands. The City of <HI>York</HI> as
well as <HI>London,</HI> is now governed by Commi&s;&s;ion, their Charter being
&s;eized into the King's Hands, who out of his natural Goodne&s;s will grant
them new Char|ters. A <HI>Quo Warranto</HI> being &s;ent down again&s;t the
Charter of the City of <HI>Exeter,</HI> they imme|diately re&s;olved to lay
their Charter at the King's Feet, and to make &s;uch a Re&s;ignation thereof as
his Maje&s;ty &s;hall think fit: By which may be &s;een the general Duty of his
Maje&s;ty's Sub|jects to his Royal Authority. A great Change in few Months!
which next to the good Provi|dence of God, is to be attributed to his
Maje|&s;ty's great Prudence and Conduct.</P>
<P>The Lord Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Jeffries</HI> being re|turned from
his Circuit, is gone to <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> to lay at his Maje&s;ty's Feet
&s;everal Charters that were &s;urrendered to him in his Circuit, where mo&s;t
Corporations have &s;ubmitted to his Maje&s;ty's good Plea&s;ure therein. Their
Ma|je&s;ties <PB N="389" REF="411"> are returned from <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI>
and their Royal Highne&s;&s;es, with the Prince and Prince&s;s of
<HI>Denmark</HI> the Day before; the King and Duke, &s;ince the Di&s;covery of
the Con&s;piracy, never travelling the &s;ame Day together.</P>
<P>This Week Mr. <HI>Ro&s;ewell,</HI> a Nonconformi&s;t Preacher,
was committed to <HI>Newgate,</HI> having uttered trea&s;onable Words, as he
was holding forth in a Conventicle. He will not be tryed at the <HI>Old
Baily,</HI> but at the King's Bench Bar, the next Term. The Words he is charged
with are very &s;editious and trea&s;onable, and as well again&s;t the late
King as the pre&s;ent Government, and are proved by &s;o many Witne&s;&s;es,
that he is like to pa&s;s his Time very ill.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not forget to tell, that upon Mr. Se|cretary
<HI>Jenkins</HI>'s laying down, with the King's Leave, his being Principal
Secretary of State, I was then put into the Province of the Earl of
<HI>Sunderland,</HI> who wrote me this following Letter, dated the 25th of
<HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1684, at <HI>Wind&s;or.</HI></P>

</LETTER>
<P>About this time the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador in
<HI>England, Don Pedro de Ronquillos,</HI> took an Occa&s;ion to &s;peak with
the King my Ma&s;ter in the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s Behalf, by Order from
the <HI>Marquis de Grana,</HI> then Governour of the <HI>Spani&s;h
Netherlands,</HI> which produced a Letter from the King to the Marquis, which
was &s;ent to me to deliver; wherein his Maje&s;ty let the Marquis know, how
much he was di&s;|&s;atisfied with the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s
Com|portment, which I repre&s;ented to his Excellen|cy in the be&s;t Terms I
could: But the <HI>Marquis de Grana</HI> told me, he knew from whence the
King's Di&s;plea&s;ure came, and that it was the Duke of <HI>York</HI> who was
the great Enemy of the Duke <PB N="391" REF="413"> of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> whom
the King loved as he did his Eyes, and endeavoured to per&s;wade me to &s;hew
the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> great Civilities. I told his Excellency, that I
was ab&s;olutely to obey my Ma&s;ter, who had commanded me not to own him, and
at the &s;ame time had &s;poken to <HI>Don Pedro</HI> to repre&s;ent to the
King of <HI>Spain</HI> his Ma&s;ter, in what ill Circum&s;tances the Duke of
<HI>Monmouth</HI> &s;tood with the King his Father.</P>
<P>It was a &s;trange Ingratitude in the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI>
who was in quiet Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all Places of Tru&s;t, Profit, or
Honour, which could make him either happy or &s;erviceable for the Government,
or grateful to the People, to be engaged in a Con&s;piracy which was again&s;t
Religion, Morality, and the common Sen&s;e of Humanity, and the highe&s;t
Ingratitude to the King his Father, and even to Heaven it &s;elf. Certainly
this counterfeit <HI>Ab&s;alom</HI> took a Glo|ry to exceed in Wickedne&s;s,
that no Man &s;hould be &s;o infamous as him&s;elf; who with the Gracefulne&s;s
of his Per&s;on, with his Po|pularity and other &s;ini&s;ter and ba&s;e
Artifices, had &s;trangely in&s;inuated him&s;elf among&s;t the wor&s;t of Men,
the common People; and be|fore the Con&s;piracy broke out, he made &s;ome
Voyages into the Country, and addre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf to the Populace, like
another <HI>Ab&s;alom,</HI> which went to his Royal Father's Heart. His
rebellious Son <HI>Ab&s;alom!</HI> who was no &s;ooner gone from his Father's
Pre&s;ence, but he endea|voured to &s;teal away the Hearts of his People, and
alienate the Affections of his Subjects from <PB N="392" REF="414"> their
Obedience. His ambitious Son! whom no Preferments could content: His ungrateful
Son! with his artificial Submi&s;&s;ion at his Fa|ther's Feet; but was no
&s;ooner gone from his Pre&s;ence, but denied all he had confe&s;&s;ed: And yet
his royal and indulgent Father was willing to forget
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> forgive all his Faults, if he
would but confe&s;s and acknowledge what he had done. But, <HI>Benefacere,
&amp; malum audire<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> regium
e&s;t.</HI> It is too often the ill Fortune of Kings to be ill &s;poken of,
when they do be&s;t for their Sub|jects Good. For after our blood-thir&s;ty
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Rebels had murdered their late King, and brought the Nation
to great Confu&s;ion, which continued for &s;ome Years, when God was
mi|raculou&s;ly plea&s;ed to re&s;tore them to their an|cient Government, by
&s;ending them their own King: Yet were the People &s;o ungrateful, that in
place of prai&s;ing God for &s;o great a Benefit, like the ancient
<HI>Jews,</HI> they complained and murmured at that very Time when God was
leading them into the Land of Promi&s;e, into Peace and Plenty; they wi&s;hed
them&s;elves back in <HI>Egypt,</HI> whining after their Leeks and Oni|ons, and
de&s;iring their former Slavery: Even &s;o at this time, Conventicles, by their
leering Whines, and their melting Complaints, in&s;inu|ated the &s;ad Times
that were coming, even the Coffee-hou&s;es croaked with the Noi&s;e of it, and
there came out every Day &s;ome compleat Arti|fice in Print, &s;uch as the
<HI>Popi&s;h Coun&s;ellour Julian.</HI> Now, when People's Heads are once
actuated with &s;uch Hurricanes of Jealou&s;ies and <PB N="393" REF="415">
Fears, and that their Religion, Properties and Liberties are pulling down, what
can &s;top their Rage from attempting or believing any thing that is mo&s;t
unrea&s;onable and contradi|ctory to the Sen&s;e of their own Good? The People
at this time were &s;oon overper&s;waded to entertain Fears of the Lo&s;s of
that Liber|ty, of which no Nation under Heaven was more &s;ecure; and yet Men
were &s;o befooled, to undertake that which would certainly bring them to
Tyranny and Slavery. And from hence this King <HI>Charles</HI> II. felt the
Rage of that rebellious Faction in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, which endeavoured
to make his Maje&s;ty cheap abroad, and contemptible at Home, by arraigning the
Ju&s;tice of his Government, and exciting a Hatred of the King's Per&s;on, and
did infe&s;t the Nation with Swarms of pe&s;tilent Libels, which like Locu&s;ts
over&s;pread the Land, poi&s;oned the Minds of the People, and drowned all the
little Remains of Duty, Alle|giance, Civility, and common Hone&s;ty, offering
to remove from the King the very Guards of his royal Per&s;on, by precluding
the Advantage he might take of his own Revenues, by their unwarrantable and
unrea&s;onable Votes, which expo&s;ed his Maje&s;ty to all Dangers that might
happen, by endeavouring to deprive him of the Po&s;&s;ibility of &s;upporting
the Government, by running down the King and all his loyal Sub|jects to the
late woful, or wor&s;er Evils and Events, to which the rebellious Senate of
1641 had brought the Nation.</P>
<P><PB N="394" REF="416">Now when &s;uch a Number of di&s;contented
People are a&s;&s;embled, pretending their Religion is in Danger, this does
influence them to the highe&s;t Re&s;olution of acting, be the Attempts never
&s;o hazardous; and we may very well re|member, that Religion, Liberty and
Property, were lo&s;t and gone, when Monarchy by the Long Parliament was taken
away, and could never be revived, till Monarchy was mo&s;t hap|pily re&s;tored;
and if this Con&s;piracy had &s;uc|ceeded, we had been wor&s;e than ever. About
this time we heard every Day new Stories of the Growth of Popery and Arbitrary
Govern|ment, with many &s;currilous Reflections upon the King; and if any Man
dur&s;t &s;hew his Fi|delity to the Monarchy, by oppo&s;ing their
An|timonarchical Principles, he was pre&s;ently bla&s;ted with the Name of a
Court or a Church Papi&s;t. How unwarrantable were the Procee|dings and
&s;editious Votes of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, and their pragmatical
intermeddling with the Succe&s;&s;ion; a Thing top &s;acred to be tou|ched by
their unhallowed Hands! it being the Belief of all good, as well as learned
Men, that no Power under Heaven can hinder the De&s;cent of the Crown upon the
next Heir of the Blood, which is his unalterable Right by Religion, Law,
Hi&s;tory and Rea&s;on: Yet the Hou&s;e of Commons re&s;olved again&s;t it, and
would not be undeceived by undeniable Arguments: Nay, they voted, they would
make his Maje&s;ty a Glorious King, with a better Revenue than any of his
Predece&s;&s;ors, by taking away all his <PB N="395" REF="417"> kingly Power,
&s;o that he &s;hould not be able to &s;upport his Friends, or &s;uppre&s;s his
Enemies. Nay, they voted, That who&s;oever &s;hould lend the King any Money
upon the &s;everal Branches of his Revenue, &s;hould an&s;wer it in Parliament;
whereby they not only took away all Hopes of nece&s;&s;ary Supplies, but tied
the Hands of the King's faithful Subjects, and would have redu|ced him to a
more helple&s;s Condition than the meane&s;t of his Subjects: And they
a&s;&s;umed a Power to them&s;elves of &s;u&s;pending Acts of Par|liament, by
re&s;olving, that the Pro&s;ecution of Di&s;&s;enters upon the Penal Laws, was
grievous to the Subject, and dangerous to the Peace of the Kingdom; and nothing
would &s;erve the&s;e ill-natured Gentlemen, but a total Exclu&s;ion of his
Royal Highne&s;s's &s;ucceeding to the Crown, to which the King had often and
po&s;itively told them, he could neither in Honour, Con&s;cience, or Ju&s;tice
con&s;ent; and yet, in&s;tead of advan|cing his Maje&s;ty's Honour and
Greatne&s;s, they per&s;i&s;ted re&s;olute in what they demanded. When the King
&s;aw they went &s;o fa&s;t, he thought it high Time to prorogue them, which he
did &s;everal times, in hopes of their agreeing at la&s;t; but they were
&s;till &s;o unhappy as not to agree, which rendered the Friend&s;hip of
<HI>England</HI> un&s;afe to tru&s;t to, and which made our warlike wary
Neighbours take other Re&s;oluti|ons, whereby we gratified our Enemies, and
di&s;couraged our Friends by our un&s;ea&s;onable Di&s;putes. And indeed the
Calling of Parlia|ments does &s;ometimes great Hurt, when more 
<PB N="396" REF="418"> Men are called together, than can be united in
Affections and Intere&s;ts, and they rather break into Factions, than join in
publick Intere&s;t; from whence have ri&s;en tho&s;e dangerous Facti|ons which
ruined the Peace and Happine&s;s of our Nation.</P>
<P>Sovereign Princes, as ours in <HI>England,</HI> have ever been
God's Vicegerents upon Earth, deri|ving their Power and Authority from him
alone who hath delegated Part of his own Power to Kings, and &s;tampt his own
Character upon them; and therefore we are never to &s;peak rudely to them, nor
de&s;ign any Evil again&s;t them: And the primitive Fathers often acknow|ledged
the Heathen Emperors to be con&s;tituted by God, and to hold their Empire from
him only, and to have God only above them: And therefore, in the early Ages of
the Church, the Doctrine of Que&s;tioning the &s;upreme Ma|gi&s;trate was
unknown, and there was no &s;uch thing as Rebellion in the fir&s;t Centuries of
the Church; and what&s;oever the Forms of Govern|ment were, which differ
according to the Cu|&s;toms of their Country, yet the Power and Au|thority it
&s;elf is derived from God, and never received of the People in Tru&s;t; nor is
the &s;overeign Power an&s;werable to the People for the Admini&s;tration of
it. But when Men pre|&s;ume to think, that the King is the People's Creature,
deriving his Power and Tru&s;t from them, they will implead the King's
Authority, as a conditional and precarious Thing, and upon the lea&s;t
Di&s;tru&s;t, will meditate a Revocation <PB N="397" REF="419"> of their
Tru&s;t; &s;o that what&s;oever is done, the King mu&s;t an&s;wer for it: So
apt are re&s;ty Men to clamour again&s;t their own Happine&s;s, and to promote
the Steps of their own Ruine. <HI>Solo|mon,</HI> who was a great and a wi&s;e
King, had &s;ome Hundreds of &s;trange Wives, contrary to the Law of
<HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and by rea&s;on of them, he fell to Idolatry; yet neither
Prie&s;t nor People took up Arms again&s;t him, but left it to God, who is the
proper Judge of Kings, who, in the Time appointed by his divine Providence,
rai&s;ed up <HI>Jeroboam</HI> to cha&s;ti&s;e him in his Son.</P>
<P>I know, <HI>Calvin</HI> &s;ays, That the Magi&s;trates, or any
Part of the Realm, may re&s;i&s;t the King, being an Idolater, as <HI>Jehu</HI>
revolted from <HI>Joram,</HI> when he for&s;ook God. Nay, he &s;ays farther,
the Government of the Kingdom is not given to the King alone; and that there is
a Stipulation in all hereditary Kingdoms: As in <HI>France,</HI> when the King
is crowned, the Bi&s;hops of <HI>Bauvais</HI> and <HI>Lyons</HI> a&s;k the
People, if they de&s;ire and command this Man to be King. But &s;urely
<HI>Calvin</HI> forgot that he was born at <HI>Noyon</HI> in <HI>Picardy,</HI>
and that this is no Argument that they cho&s;e him to be King, much le&s;s that
they make him &s;uch: For this is an Acceptation only, and not an Electi|on; a
Declaration of their willing Subjection, and nothing el&s;e; the Kingdom was
confe&s;&s;ed before to be hereditary, and the Succe&s;&s;ion was determined by
Law. The Kings of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France</HI> count the Time of their
Reign from their Entrance to the Crown. And was not <HI>Henry</HI> VII.
&s;everal Years before he was crowned? <PB N="398" REF="420"> The Peers are
<HI>Pares inter &s;e,</HI> but not Compa|nions to the King. In <HI>England</HI>
all the Power and Authority depends upon the King, and the State is nothing but
the Authority of the King, who is the Fountain whence &s;prings all Au|thority
and Nobility. He &s;ummons the great Council the Parliament, and di&s;&s;olves
them when he plea&s;es: And he that would re&s;train Sovereignty within any
narrower Bounds, or communicate it to others, makes no Difference between the
Crown of a King, and the Bonnet of a Duke of <HI>Venice.</HI> I know,
<HI>Buchanan</HI> &s;ays, Princes may be depo&s;ed by the People, if they be
Enemies to God and his Truth; and that their Subjects are freed from their
Oaths and their Obedience, and that the People are above the King, and of
greater Authority than he. The Ca&s;e of the idolatrous <HI>Iraelites</HI> was
plain, the People acted nothing but by the Command of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> who was
&s;upreme Magi&s;trate, neither did he command any thing to be done, but from
the Mouth of God, according to the expre&s;s Law, <HI>Deuteronomy</HI> 13.</P>
<P>This is not to put the Sword into the Peo|ple's Hands, and to
permit them to execute their fiery Zeal upon whom they plea&s;e, under
Pre|tence of rooting out Super&s;tition, e&s;pecially &s;uch as no Man judges
&s;o but them&s;elves. Per|&s;ecution in Matters of Religion is not the be&s;t
Way to advance Religion, which is the Judg|ment of wi&s;e and learned Men, even
of Pro|te&s;tants, and better than any can be &s;hewed for the contrary.
<HI>O&s;iander</HI> &s;ays, That God doth <PB N="399" REF="421"> not allow,
that Hereticks &s;hould be puni&s;hed with Death, and forbids Magi&s;trates to
execute any &s;uch Authority: And <HI>Calvin</HI> was of the &s;ame Opinion,
till he was &s;ettled in Power at <HI>Geneva.</HI> For before, he was much for
Liber|ty of Con&s;cience; and of the &s;ame Judgment was <HI>Melancton</HI> and
many other learned Prote|&s;tants, as, <HI>Ca&s;&s;ander, Grotius,</HI> and
many other of the middle Temper. The Cantons of <HI>Switzer|land</HI> agree
well in temperate things; and does not the famous Kingdom of <HI>Poland</HI>
tolerate Di|ver&s;ity of Religions? and the great Emperor of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI>
does the &s;ame. What Rea&s;on can be given by indifferent Men, why the Policy
of <HI>England</HI> &s;hould be &s;o &s;ingular, and &s;o differing from that
of all other Chri&s;tian Kingdoms and Nations about her? Why &s;hould the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Government be more &s;evere in this Point, than that of our
Neighbours? It may &s;eem &s;ome|thing to reflect upon the Honour of our
Na|tion, to mention the <HI>Turk</HI> in this Ca&s;e; yet certainly it cannot
be denied, but that Chri&s;ti|ans live quietly in the <HI>Turk</HI>'s
Dominions, and upon Conditions &s;o ea&s;y, that the Catholicks in
<HI>England</HI> would be well contented with the like, who by the Grace of God
have, and would de|mean them&s;elves as loyally in all Points, as not to
attempt any thing offen&s;ive to the State, or prejudicial to the publick
Peace. There is nothing in the Catholick Religion incon&s;i&s;tent with
Loyalty; and Catholicks are in Truth better Subjects than Prote&s;tants have
&s;hewed them&s;elves to be, generally &s;peaking, con&s;ide|ring 
<PB N="400" REF="422"> their Principles. Can any Man deny, but that there was a
mo&s;t horrid Rebellion carried on by Prote&s;tants in <HI>England?</HI> And
the Catholicks hope, that having always wi&s;hed well to his Maje&s;ty's Title,
and prayed for his happy Succe&s;&s;ion to his Kingdoms, that their &s;o long
tried Fidelity will at la&s;t procure them &s;ome Liberty and Refre&s;hment. I
know, <HI>Calvin</HI> &s;ays, they are out of their Wits who de&s;ire to live
under Sovereign Monarchies; and &s;ays, Order and Policy mu&s;t needs decay,
where one Man holds &s;uch an Extent of Government: And Kings, &s;ays he,
oftentimes forget they are Men, and they are &s;tyled <HI>Dei
grati&acirc;,</HI> for no other Purpo&s;e, but to &s;hew that they acknow|ledge
no Superior upon Earth, and that they u&s;ually make Choice of &s;uch
Coun&s;ellours as can be&s;t fit their Humours, and accommodate them&s;elves to
their Appetites: So that he ma|keth Kings nothing the better for having
Coun|&s;ellours, whom he &s;tains with an intolerable Scandal. And
<HI>Buchanan</HI> &s;ays, St. <HI>Paul</HI> com|mands Obedience to Princes, in
the Infancy of the Church; and if he had lived at this Time, he would have
&s;aid otherwi&s;e. But as it is &s;aid, <HI>Nullum unquam magnum ingenium
&s;ine aliqua mixtura in&s;aniae</HI>; &s;o <HI>Buchanan</HI> was a
high-&s;oaring Wit, and had &s;ome Tincture of Phrenzy: For had he been
perfectly &s;ound, he would never have let &s;lip &s;uch a <HI>Hy&s;teron
Pro|teron</HI> as this from his Pen. And <HI>Knox,</HI> in his Hi&s;tory of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> not only ju&s;tifies what <HI>Buchanan</HI> &s;ays, but
would be content, that <PB N="401" REF="423"> there were publick Rewards
appointed for &s;uch as murder Tyrants, as there are for &s;uch as kill Wolves;
which is a mo&s;t pernicious Doctrine, fit for nothing but to encourage a
<HI>Ravilliac,</HI> or a <HI>Poltrat. Calvin,</HI> who writes in the Quality of
a Divine, in his In&s;titutions, makes a <HI>Nebuchadnezar</HI> of all Kings,
that he might not come &s;hort of his Predece&s;&s;or <HI>Martin
Luther.</HI></P>
<P>I confe&s;s, Princes once di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;eldom
recover their Hold again. There is none will deny, but that it is nece&s;&s;ary
the Government of all Princes &s;hould be regulated by Laws, and that Per&s;ons
in Authority do ob&s;erve tho&s;e Rules that are pre&s;cribed to them by
tho&s;e to whom that Power belongs. I pretend not to enhance the Authority of
Princes &s;o far, as to exempt them from the Rule of Law, or to make them
arbitrary in their Government: But when it is &s;aid, <HI>Vos e&s;tis Dii,</HI>
they are ju&s;tly e&s;tabli&s;hed in the &s;upreme Authority; and when <HI>I
have &s;aid, Ye are Gods,</HI> &s;urely it was inten|ded rather to teach the
World a Le&s;&s;on of Obe|dience, than Rebellion; and Kings by tho&s;e Words
are ju&s;tly e&s;tabli&s;hed by divine Provi|dence in the &s;ame Authority, and
exempted from any popular Cognizance. It's proper on|ly for God to &s;ay,
<HI>Transferam Regna de Gente in Gentem:</HI> The Tran&s;lating of Kingdoms is
the extraordinary Di&s;pen&s;ation of divine Pro|vidence, for Rea&s;ons known
to God's &s;ecret Wi&s;dom: And tho' this be done by the Hands of Men, yet are
not the common People licen|&s;ed thereby to run upon any irregular De&s;igns 
<PB N="402" REF="424"> of their own Head, and to take Revenge of their
Governours. St. <HI>Paul</HI> commands every Soul to pay Obedience and Honour
to <HI>Nero,</HI> who was God's Lieutenant upon Earth, and had the Image of God
upon him, that is, God's Authority, and was therefore to be u&s;ed with due
Honour and Reverence. When <HI>Julian,</HI> of a Chri&s;tian Emperor, became
Apo&s;tate, and per&s;ecuted the Chri&s;tians with great Cruelty; tho' the
People &s;harply reproved, and inveighed again&s;t his Proceedings, yet none of
them took up Arms again&s;t him, to depo&s;e him of Domi|nion or Life; and if
they thought it not expe|dient to do &s;o again&s;t a Tyrant, who only acted by
his exorbitant Pa&s;&s;ions, how much le&s;s would they have thought it lawful
to be done again&s;t &s;uch Princes as govern legally, and do nothing again&s;t
Religion. We mu&s;t know, that Kings are to be con&s;idered in a double
Ca|pacity, of Nature, and of Policy: The Body Politick never dies, and &s;o is
never defective of Authority. The Acts of the Body Politick are not abated by
the Natural Body's Acce&s;s; the Body Politick is not di&s;abled to govern by
the Nonnage of the Natural. So in the 4th of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> the
Lea&s;es of the Dutchy of <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> made by King <HI>Edward</HI> VI.
were re&s;olved by all the Judges to be good, tho' made in the King's Minority:
For tho' the King's Body Natural cannot judge, yet that di&s;ables not, that
the Acts of his Minority, ordered by his Council or Regent, &s;hould be of no
Vali|dity. The Parliament certainly would not take <PB N="403" REF="425"> it
well, if a Catholick &s;hould affirm, that the Change of Religion made by King
<HI>Edward</HI> VI. was not warrantable, being done in his Mino|rity, when he
had not Age to di&s;cern what he did, being in the Hands of the Protector and
<HI>Northumberland.</HI></P>
<P>But, &s;uppo&s;e the King breaks his Coronation Oath, may not
many things happen after his Oath taken, to excu&s;e him from Perjury? By Law,
every Oath, how ab&s;olute &s;oever, hath always this nece&s;&s;ary Condition
annexed tacit|ly, <HI>viz. Rebus &s;ic &s;tantibus,</HI> that things remain as
they were, when the Oath was taken: But if &s;uch Alterations, which make
either the Oath or Promi&s;e impo&s;&s;ible, or unlawful to be per|formed, a
Man doth not then commit Perjury, that breaks his Oath or Promi&s;e. What, if
that which the King at his Inauguration pro|mi&s;ed for the Good of his People,
cannot be ob&s;erved, without great Damage to them? If the Condition of Affairs
be &s;o changed, Re&s;o|lutions upon them mu&s;t al&s;o change. Dr.
<HI>Bil|&s;on,</HI> a great Divine, and a great Prelate of the Church of
<HI>England,</HI> and cho&s;en on Purpo&s;e by the great State&s;men of his
Time, to write <HI>Cum Privilegio,</HI> puts the Que&s;tion, Whether a King
&s;hall be depo&s;ed for breaking his Coro|nation Oath? And he an&s;wers in the
Negative, and gives this Rea&s;on: <HI>The People may not break with their
Prince &s;o often as he breaks with God: For,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>Subjects
cannot depo&s;e their Prin|ces, to whom they mu&s;t be &s;ubject for
Con&s;cience &s;ake</HI>; which Doctrine is quite contrary to what 
<PB N="404" REF="426"> is now taught. And farther, Dr. <HI>Bil&s;on</HI>
&s;ays, That <HI>Subjects are forbidden to take Arms again&s;t their
Princes;</HI> the Rea&s;on hereof he &s;ays is invincible: <HI>For to him that
may Kill and War again&s;t a Prince, Killing him is of Con&s;equence
inevitable. The Apo&s;tle,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>obeyed Ty|rants that commanded
all things again&s;t Reli|gion; and in tho&s;e things they did &s;ubmit
them|&s;elves with Meekne&s;s to endure the Magi|&s;trate's Plea&s;ure, and not
to obey his Will.</HI> And he concludes, <HI>That if the Laws of the Land
appoint the Nobles, as next the King, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in doing right, and
to withold him from do|ing wrong, then they are licen&s;ed by Man's Law to
interpo&s;e them&s;elves, but in no Ca&s;e to deprive the Prince where the
Scepter is inherited.</HI></P>
<P>It is mo&s;t manife&s;t, that this Spirit of Refor|mation hath
ever been, and is mo&s;t dangerous to tho&s;e Princes and States where it gets
Foot|ing. This was it which begat &s;o many Con&s;pi|racies again&s;t Queen
<HI>Mary</HI>: So that more Prin|ces have been depo&s;ed and per&s;ecuted by
Pro|te&s;tants their Subjects, upon the Difference of Religion, than have been
by the Practices of any Catholick Subjects in any time before Queen
<HI>Mary</HI>'s Days, for Six Hundred Years. But we will &s;end them to Doctor
<HI>Bil&s;on,</HI> a great Divine of their own Church, who holds it an Article
of Faith, that Princes were not to be depo&s;ed; which was good Doctrine in the
Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> tho' it was not thought &s;o in the Reign of
Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> who reigned not much above Five Years, and yet had more
In&s;ur|rections <PB N="405" REF="427"> rai&s;ed again&s;t her in that &s;mall
Time, than Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> had from the Catholicks in Forty Five
Years; and yet Queen <HI>Mary</HI> was very merciful, and &s;hewed much
Compa&s;&s;ion to &s;uch as de&s;erved not well of her: To the Dutche&s;s of
<HI>Somer&s;et</HI>; to Sir <HI>John Clarke,</HI> who had been a principal
Corrupter of King <HI>Edward</HI> her Brother's Infancy; to the Lord Chief
Ju|&s;tice <HI>Montague,</HI> who both coun&s;elled and &s;ub|&s;cribed to her
Di&s;inheriting; and to many others who were attainted, that neither affected
her Religion nor Title, and were then Pri&s;o|ners in the <HI>Tower</HI>; and
yet &s;he relea&s;ed them all: And for all this, the Zealots of her Time would
not &s;uffer her to enjoy any Quiet, but murmured again&s;t the Government of
Women, and did con&s;pire and plot her Deprivation, out of a De&s;ire to
advance her Succe&s;&s;or, under whom they expected a golden Age. And
<HI>Knox</HI> then &s;aid, the Nobility, Magi&s;trates, and Judges, and the
whole People of <HI>England,</HI> were bound in Con&s;cience not only to
oppo&s;e the Proceedings of that <HI>Jezabel, Mary,</HI> but even to have
killed her, and all her Prie&s;ts with her.</P>
<P>After the Death of this Queen, her Si&s;ter <HI>Elizabeth</HI>
came to the Crown, and the whole Chri&s;tian World &s;tood amazed at &s;uch a
&s;udden Alteration; and the rather, becau&s;e Religion had been &s;o lately
and &s;o &s;olemnly re&s;tored by Parliament. Al&s;o, the Queen that now was
had always profe&s;&s;ed her &s;elf a Catholick, du|ring the Reign of her
Si&s;ter, and did con&s;tantly <PB N="406" REF="428"> hear Ma&s;s, and went
often to Confe&s;&s;ion; and in open Parliament, after her Intention for a
Change in Religion, began to be di&s;covered, &s;he u&s;ed Policy, at lea&s;t;
for &s;he a&s;&s;ured the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks, that no Trouble &s;hould
ari&s;e to them for any Difference in Religion, which did much abate the
Oppo&s;ition that otherwi&s;e might probably have been made by the Catho|lick
Party, and put the Clergy them&s;elves in Hopes of &s;ome fair Quarter under
her Govern|ment. She knew well, that a Prince alone, how &s;overeign &s;oever,
could not e&s;tabli&s;h a new Religion in this Kingdom, without a Parlia|ment
to give Authority and Countenance to it; and therefore, to win the Bi&s;hops,
and the re&s;t of the Catholicks in Parliament, to Silence, at lea&s;t, &s;he
was content to u&s;e Policy with them, and promi&s;e them fair; and &s;he
al&s;o thought good to qualify the Style &s;omewhat, from <HI>Su|preme
Head</HI> changing it into <HI>Supreme Gover|nour</HI>; which altered not the
Sen&s;e, yet it abu|&s;ed &s;ome into a Belief, that the Queen preten|ded not
much in Matters Eccle&s;ia&s;tical, as the King her Father had done, who was
<HI>Flagelium Dei,</HI> the Scourge of God to the Church of <HI>England,</HI>
and the fir&s;t King in our Nation that ever tried the admirable Patience,
Obedience, and Loyalty of his Catholick Subjects.</P>
<P><HI>Nicephorus Phocas,</HI> the Emperor, was the neare&s;t
Parallel to this King that we meet with in all the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical
Hi&s;tory; for he re&s;u|med all Donations that had been made unto
Mona&s;teries and Churches in his Time; but <PB N="407" REF="429"> &s;uch
Afflictions followed him ever after, that <HI>Ba&s;ilius</HI> his Succe&s;&s;or
(who was none of the be&s;t Emperors) was yet careful to abrogate tho&s;e Laws
of <HI>Phocas</HI> among his fir&s;t Acts, as the Root of all the Calamities of
tho&s;e Times. Nor did any better Succe&s;s attend King <HI>Harrie</HI>'s
Impieties. His exorbitant Lu&s;ts, which were the Original of all the
Mi&s;chiefs which the Nation &s;uffered, became at la&s;t his Torments. No King
was ever more nece&s;&s;itated in Point of Trea&s;ure, in very few Years after
that immen&s;e Trea&s;ure left him by his royal Father. Never did King lay more
heavy Taxes upon his Sub|jects, and never any King did u&s;e more ignoble and
unprincely Ways to rai&s;e Money; and to &s;hew God's great Di&s;plea&s;ure
again&s;t him, he was fru&s;trated of that which was pretended to be his
chiefe&s;t De&s;ign, <HI>viz.</HI> Succe&s;&s;ion and I&s;&s;ue: All his noble
Stems and Branches were taken away, one after the other, without I&s;&s;ue, and
his Crown tran&s;lated to another Name and Na|tion, God &s;uffering him as a
blind Man, to err and wander in all his Cour&s;es; and all the great Trea&s;ure
which he had raked together upon the Ruine of the Church, was all &s;pent in
Exce&s;s and Vanity, and not to any Honour of the Kingdom, nor Ea&s;e of his
Subjects, or Maintenance of the Borders, or Relief of the Poor (all which were
at fir&s;t mainly pretended) but at la&s;t all was employed in Tiltings,
Ma&s;ks, and Mummeries, and in plea&s;ing and inviting his Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es,
and to &s;atisfy the greedy Appe|tites of tho&s;e Sollicitors of his Lu&s;t.
And when <PB N="408" REF="430"> the King had thus wearied his Subjects with a
long and inglorious Reign, and that he found his Soul as much oppre&s;&s;ed
with the Guilt of his Sins, as his Body was become unweildy thro' his
exce&s;&s;ive Intemperance; he died (as &s;ome &s;ay) de&s;irous to repent, and
be reconciled to the Church; but what Effect his De&s;ires had, is only known
to God: And yet the Catho|licks took all patiently, rai&s;ed no Tumults or
In&s;urrections, but were Examples of the true <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> and did
imitate, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, their divine Ma&s;ter's Meekne&s;s, and
re&s;olved rather to undergo God's ju&s;t Puni&s;hment in the King's great
Inju&s;tice, than to &s;hew them&s;elves like &s;o many <HI>Lutherans</HI> or
<HI>Calvini&s;ts,</HI> and had only the true Chri&s;tian Arms, of Prayers and
Tears, by Submi&s;&s;ion to God's Will.</P>
<P>Kings indeed ought to con&s;ider, that God hath placed them over
his People, as Examples, to give Countenance to their Laws, by their own
&s;trict Ob&s;ervation of them; and that as their Subjects are to be protected
by their Prin|ces, &s;o they are to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted and &s;upported by each
other, the Function of Kings being an Order by it &s;elf; and the Rebellion of
Sub|jects ought to be looked upon by all other Kings as an A&s;&s;ault upon
their own Sovereignty, and in &s;ome Degree a De&s;ign again&s;t Monarchy it
&s;elf, and con&s;equently to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed in what Kingdom &s;oever it
is, with the like Concern|ment as if it were in their own Bowels: And all
foreign Mini&s;ters, who ought to have been highly concerned for the Murder of
K. <HI>Charles</HI> I. <PB N="409" REF="431"> by his mercile&s;s Rebels, and to
have vindica|ted that royal Blood, did &s;carce murmur at it, but made ha&s;te
to &s;end over their Emi&s;&s;aries to get a Share in the Spoils of a murdered
Prince: And yet not one of tho&s;e Monarchs and Prin|ces, which bought all the
co&s;tly Pictures, and rich Hangings and Furniture, ever re&s;tored any of
their unlawful Purcha&s;es to the King after his mo&s;t happy Re&s;toration.
'Tis true, the then King of <HI>Spain</HI> expre&s;&s;ed a very tender Sen&s;e
of our King's Sufferings, and &s;aid, it concerned all Kings to join together,
for Pu|ni&s;hment of &s;uch an impious Rebellion, and cruel Parricide, whil&s;t
his own Abmba&s;&s;ador, <HI>Don Alonzo de Cardinas,</HI> then in
<HI>England,</HI> not only countenanced and joined with the Parlia|ment, but
bought the greate&s;t and be&s;t Part of all the rare Pictures and rich
Moveables, which he &s;old in <HI>Spain</HI> at great Rates: And whil&s;t he
was in <HI>Flanders,</HI> he gave Count <HI>Fuen&s;aldagna</HI> a fal&s;e
Relation of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Affairs, a&s;&s;uring him that the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Monarchy would never again be re&s;tored; and when it
happened, he was laughed at by all. However, it is certain, that whil&s;t that
great Impo&s;tor <HI>Cromwell</HI> lived, his Power at Home was nothing
con&s;iderable to what it was Abroad: For <HI>France, Spain, Hol|land,</HI> and
all the neighbouring Princes feared him to that Degree, that there was nothing
he could have demanded of them that they would have denied him.</P>
<P>No Man can deny, but that many well-mean|ing Men were &s;educed
by the di&s;gui&s;ed De&s;igns <PB N="410" REF="432"> of that my&s;terious Age,
and by tho&s;e Villains who always had in their Aim to de&s;troy Mo|narchy, and
unhinge the whole Frame of Go|vernment; and the &s;ober Party were cozened by
the Artifices of that loath&s;ome Hypocrite, <HI>Cromwell:</HI> Till at la&s;t
they were in&s;pired with a Re&s;olution to redeem them&s;elves, their
Reli|gion and Liberties, which were treacherou&s;ly taken from them by Deceit
and Fraud; and to free them&s;elves from the mi&s;erable Yoke they lay under,
when they plainly &s;aw, that Reli|gion, Reformation, and Liberty, were only
deceitful Baits to draw in the deluded Multi|tude: But &s;till their mo&s;t
hopeful De&s;igns not being carried on with that Prudence and Pre|caution which
was nece&s;&s;ary, they were always di&s;covered, and did rather &s;ettle and
confirm, than weaken the Rebellion; till that over-ru|ling Hand of Providence,
which guides and determines the Affairs of the whole World, was mo&s;t
vi&s;ibly &s;een in his Maje&s;ty's mo&s;t happy Re&s;toration.</P>
<P>It is no new thing for the wor&s;t of Men to make u&s;e of the
&s;acred Name of Religion, to palliate their abominable Undertakings. The Ruine
of pious Kings and Princes, the Over|turning all Order in the World, the
tragical Tran&s;actions of the la&s;t Age, the Convul&s;ions of State, the
Commotions of the People, the many Changes and Overturnings of Governours and
Governments, were the &s;ad Effects of the pretended Reformation; and all
the&s;e Mi&s;chiefs were u&s;her'd in with the Lamb-like, harmle&s;s 
<PB N="411" REF="433"> Voice of Religion. They came indeed in Sheeps Cloathing,
who inwardly were ravening Wolves. Some Mens Religion inclines them to Faction,
and there is none to dangerous Faction as that which is nouri&s;hed by the
Corruption of fal&s;e Religion. The <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Zealots and the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Enthu&s;ia&s;ts are a plain Example of it; and therefore
when Men make great Pretences, and begin to talk factiou&s;ly, a fair
Opportunity is very like to make them Rebels: And tho&s;e who have &s;een what
the Event of tho&s;e Actions were in the Years of 1640 and 1641, when they
&s;aw the &s;ame things acted over again, and even by &s;ome of the &s;ame Men,
they might ea&s;ily and certainly expect the &s;ame Events: And if Men had
&s;eriou&s;ly ob&s;erved this, the &s;ame Men would never have played over the
&s;ame Game twice in the &s;ame Age; which obliged the then Lord Chancellor to
take Notice of it in his Speech to both Hou&s;es of Parliament, That he hoped
they would not &s;ee three Kingdoms quite de|&s;troyed twice in one Age, by the
&s;ame Methods; telling them, when Men were in their Wits, they would not fall
into the &s;ame Pit, in which they had &s;een others fall before them, when
even Bea&s;ts will not do it, let the Bait be what it will. But, alas! many of
tho&s;e who were the principal Makers of the fir&s;t, were &s;o far from
falling into it, that they were the chiefe&s;t Diggers of the &s;econd Pit, in
which &s;o many had fallen: And we were then come to that Pa&s;s, that it was
an unpardonable Crime for any Man to look as if he thought the Cry of
<HI>Popery!</HI> was fal&s;e, <PB N="412" REF="434"> and made a Property only
(as it then really was) to &s;erve &s;ome Mens Ends and De&s;igns.</P>
<P>It was a great Fault in King <HI>Charles</HI> I. at lea&s;t, a
great Weakne&s;s in him, to dive&s;t him|&s;elf of the Power of di&s;&s;olving
the Long Par|liament, which was a ju&s;t Prerogative belong|ing to him: And
tho' the Parliament then &s;aid, that &s;hould not encourage them to do any
thing which otherwi&s;e was not fit for them to do; yet they &s;oon invaded the
publick Liberty, and they who &s;aid they had no Mind to be Slaves, were yet
willing to be Tyrants them&s;elves, and would admit no Rules to govern by but
their own Will; not con&s;idering the Mi&s;ery of <HI>Athens</HI> was at the
highe&s;t when it was governed by Thirty Tyrants. And therefore the wi&s;e&s;t
Cour&s;e of Princes is frequently to &s;ummon Parliaments, and &s;ea&s;onably
to di&s;&s;olve them after their applying Cures to tho&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es they
had di&s;covered, whereby they would be of great E&s;teem to the Crown, as well
as Veneration with the People, and not let them &s;it any longer, le&s;t they
&s;hould fall into Factions, and pretend to find Grievances where there are
none. And if King <HI>Charles</HI> II. had lived &s;ome Years longer, he had
certainly brought them to that Pa&s;s, and pre&s;erved <HI>England</HI> from
the Di&s;tractions that have &s;ince followed; which his Maje&s;ty fore&s;aw,
and which cau&s;ed him to make tho&s;e frequent Intervals of Parliaments. And
yet his Maje&s;ty declared unto them, That none of his Predece&s;&s;ors ever
had a greater E&s;teem for Parliaments, the King believing 
<PB N="413" REF="435"> them to be the vital Part of the Con&s;titution of the
Kingdom, and &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for the Govern|ment of it, that neither Prince
nor People could be happy without them; and looked up|on their Coun&s;els as
the be&s;t he could receive, and was as tender of their Privileges, and as
careful to pre&s;erve and protect them, as of his own royal Authority; knowing
that all good Subjects would be jealous of any thing that might infringe or
impair his royal Authori|ty, his own Intere&s;t being entirely bound up with
that of his Subjects. But they &s;hould con&s;ider, that Parliament Men &s;it
as Subjects, not as Superiors, and that they are called to be the King's
Coun&s;ellours, not Dictators, their Summons being only to recommend their
Advice, not to command. They &s;hould be wi&s;e, di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate, good
Patriots, to rai&s;e up tho&s;e Banks and Fences which were ca&s;t down by
Rebellion, in Hopes that the &s;ame Pro&s;peri|ty &s;hould &s;pring up again
from tho&s;e Roots which it did heretofore, and hath always grown, tho' it was
very hard to redeem our Nation from the Infamy it had undergone, and to
re&s;tore it to all it had lo&s;t, and to make the King and People as happy as
they ought to be; and there was nothing that the Parliament could propo&s;e for
the Happine&s;s of the King|dom, in which the King did not contend with them to
compa&s;s, the King not being only wil|ling, but de&s;irous to gratify his
People, by &s;e|curing their Religion, Liberties and Properties, by as many
good Laws as the Parliament <PB N="414" REF="436"> would propo&s;e. He was
ab&s;olutely determined to do all that in him lay to glad the Hearts of his
People, and gave them many Opportunities of providing for their Good; and it
could not be imputed to his Maje&s;ty, that the Succe&s;s did not an&s;wer his
Expectation.</P>
<P>The particular Cau&s;es of the King's Di&s;&s;a|tisfaction were
&s;uch, that what he recommen|ded to the Hou&s;e of Commons to avoid, they
purpo&s;ely fell into; and tho' the King &s;olemn|ly promi&s;ed to comply with
any thing that would have been propo&s;ed for Security of the Prote&s;tant
Religion as by Law e&s;tabli&s;hed, that might con&s;i&s;t with pre&s;erving
the Succe&s;&s;ion of the Crown in its due and legal Cour&s;e of De|&s;cent:
Yet to all his Maje&s;ty's Offers he met with mo&s;t un&s;uitable and mo&s;t
unwarrantable Returns. The King would mo&s;t willingly have con&s;ented to any
Expedient by which the Pro|te&s;tant Religion e&s;tabli&s;hed might have been
pre&s;erved, and the Monarchy not de&s;troyed: But no Expedient would &s;erve
tho&s;e ill-natured Gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Commons, but the total
Exclu&s;ion of the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> which his Maje&s;ty had &s;o often
declared, was a Point which in Honour, Ju&s;tice and Con&s;cience, he could not
con&s;ent to. When this Bill of Ex|clu&s;ion was fir&s;t &s;et on Foot, it was
well &s;aid, by a noble Per&s;on then in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, That the King
might outlive the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> and then all they were doing would be
unnece&s;&s;ary; and why &s;hould they, to pre|vent that which might not be,
attempt to do <PB N="415" REF="437"> that which they could never ju&s;tify,
either to the King or Country. When the King found they went contrary to the
direct Rules of Law, that he was deceived by them, and that the Follies and
Imprudencies of the prevailing Par|ty in the Hou&s;e of Commons (&s;ome of
which had given Birth and Growth to the Mi&s;eries of the la&s;t Age) and were
now pouring in Vinegar in&s;tead of Oil, into the Wounds of the Nation, and
departed from that Fidelity which they owed the King, and that Zeal which they
&s;hould have &s;hewed to his Service, and that nothing would &s;erve them of
the &s;ame Leaven with tho&s;e of 1641, but the total Exclu&s;ion of his Royal
Highne&s;s &s;ucceeding to the Crown, and had prepared an Act for it, the King
came in Per|&s;on to the Hou&s;e of Lords, and &s;ent for the Commons to attend
him, in the Year 1680. The King then &s;pake roundly to them, and told them how
un&s;atisfied he was with their extra|vagant Proceedings, and de&s;ired to know
&s;pee|dily, how he &s;hould be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by them, and what they de&s;ired
from him, a&s;&s;uring them in the Word of a King, that he would concur to any
thing for the Security of the Prote&s;tant Religion, as it was e&s;tabli&s;hed
by Law, but &s;till upon the &s;ame Terms he had formerly propo&s;ed to them,
and that he would never do it other|wi&s;e.</P>
<P>But before the Hou&s;e of Commons went to the Lords, where the
King in his Robes ex|pected them, they pa&s;&s;ed tho&s;e en&s;uing Votes: That
the only Way for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing of Popery, <PB N="416" REF="438"> was, that
a Bill &s;hould be brought in to bani&s;h immediately all the con&s;iderable
Papi&s;ts in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> out of the King's Dominions: That &s;o long as
the Papi&s;ts had any Hopes of the Duke of <HI>York</HI>'s &s;ucceeding to the
Crown, the King's Per&s;on, the Prote&s;tant Religion, the Lives, Liberties and
Properties of all his Ma|je&s;ty's Prote&s;tant Subjects, were in apparent
Danger to be de&s;troyed. They farther voted, That a Bill &s;hould be brought
in for an A&s;&s;o|ciation of all his Maje&s;ty's Prote&s;tant Subjects, for
the Safety of his Maje&s;ty's Per&s;on, for De|fence of the Prote&s;tant
Religion again&s;t all Ty|ranny and Oppre&s;&s;ion what&s;oever; and for
pre|venting the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> or any Papi&s;t, for &s;ucceeding to the
Crown. They did likewi&s;e declare, That it was the Opinion, that the Duke of
<HI>Monmouth</HI> had been removed from his Offices and Commands, by the
Influence of the Duke of <HI>York</HI>; and that an Addre&s;s &s;hould be made
to the King, to re&s;tore the Duke of <HI>Mon|mouth</HI> to his Offices and
Commands; and re&s;ol|ved likewi&s;e (ju&s;t before the King being in his Robes
had &s;ent for them to the Lords Hou&s;e to prorogue them) that who&s;oever
advi&s;ed the King to that Prorogation, which they &s;aid was done on Purpo&s;e
again&s;t Pa&s;&s;ing the Bill for Exclu&s;ion of the Duke of <HI>York,</HI>
was a Betrayer of the King, the Prote&s;tant Religion, the King|dom of
<HI>England,</HI> a Promoter of the <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;t, and a
Pen&s;ioner of <HI>France.</HI> They al&s;o voted at the &s;ame time, That it
was the Opinion of the Hou&s;e, that the City of <HI>London</HI> 
<PB N="417" REF="439"> was burnt by the Papi&s;ts in 1666, thereby de|&s;igning
to introduce Popery and Arbitrary Power. Upon the&s;e extravagant, in&s;olent,
and di&s;loyal Votes, the King forthwith di&s;&s;olved the Parliament.</P>
<P>Now the &s;trange&s;t thing was, that tho&s;e who mo&s;t
pretended in the Hou&s;e of Commons for Reformation, had a bare-fac'd Contempt
and Di&s;ta&s;te of all Religion what&s;oever, and not &s;o much as the Shadow
of Vertue: Men of the mo&s;t licentious Lives, of the mo&s;t &s;eared
Con|&s;ciences, of the mo&s;t profligate Reputation, that had bid Defiance to
all Religion, and mo&s;t di|ligently cultivated Athei&s;m and Profanene&s;s. It
is indeed enough to move the mo&s;t patient Man upon Earth, to con&s;ider what
Foreheads of Steel and Adamant tho&s;e impious Wretches had, who were thus
confident to gull and im|po&s;e upon the People of <HI>England,</HI> by
&s;eem|ing Zeal for Religion and Reformation: But &s;uch as rebel under
Pretence of Religion, are mo&s;t dangerous to the Government; they will pretend
to defend the King's Per&s;on again&s;t Ca|tholicks, that them&s;elves only
might have the Honour of &s;ubverting the Government; &s;o hard a thing it is
to cure one that is bewitched with the Principles of Rebellion, that after many
Years he &s;hall return to his Trade as boldly as if his former Pranks had
never been heard of. Fear of Popery, Arbitrary Government, and evil
Coun&s;ellours, in my Memory, &s;ince the Year 1641, made our
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation run mad, co&s;t an infinite Trea&s;ure, with the
Lives of <PB N="418" REF="440"> &s;ome Thou&s;and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>; and, in
Conclu&s;ion, in&s;tead of Religion, &s;etting up Enthu&s;ia&s;m; in&s;tead of
Liberty, the Nation was en&s;laved to a military Power; in&s;tead of Property,
Plunder, Sacrilege, and Seque&s;tration; and they were ju&s;t playing the
&s;ame Game over again in this King's Time, if by little le&s;s than a Miracle,
they had not been prevented: And who&s;oever throws off his Allegiance to his
Sovereign, he renounces all Duty and Con&s;cience towards God.</P>
<P>The King calls a Parliament by his own Writ and Authority
(without which they cannot meet) to give him faithful Coun&s;el about his
mo&s;t weighty Affairs; but he does not re&s;ign up his Intere&s;t and Freedom:
He never &s;ub|jects him&s;elf to their ab&s;olute Determination: He always
weighs their Coun&s;els, as coming from a Body entru&s;ted by him; and when he
di&s;&s;ents from them, he tells them the Rea&s;ons which prevailed with his
Con&s;cience and Un|der&s;tanding, with that Candor that a Prince &s;hould do
towards his Subjects. A King &s;hould look upon his Parliament as his great
Council, to who&s;e Advice he &s;hould always have Regard: But a King &s;hould
likewi&s;e look upon him&s;elf, as neither deprived of his Under&s;tanding, nor
dive&s;ted of any Right he had, if there was no Parliament &s;itting. The
King's Power is un|doubtedly very u&s;eful for his People's Liber|ty, and
Parliaments ought not to &s;et Bounds to their Princes; and wi&s;e Princes will
never de|&s;ire nor affect more Greatne&s;s or Prerogative, 
<PB N="419" REF="441"> than what is really for the Good of their Subjects.</P>
<P>The Truth is, &s;ince the happy Re&s;toration of our King, his
People were given up to too much Joy and Forgetfulne&s;s of our pa&s;t
Mi&s;e|ries; and there was not &s;uch a Return to God for his wonderful
Ble&s;&s;ings, as was due to the great Giver of them; and when we &s;aw &s;ome
Portion of that innocent royal Blood which was &s;pilt, recompen&s;ed upon
&s;ome of their Heads, who were the wicked Contrivers of that Parricide: When
the Mi&s;eries of our Na|tion, and the Sufferings of the Royal Family were all
recovered by the unerring Hand of divine Providence, without the Intervention
of any foreign Prince, many of the &s;ame Men joining in the Settlement of our
di&s;tracted Na|tion, who had before been active in the De|&s;truction of their
Country, to &s;hew how &s;en&s;i|ble they were of their former Errors and great
Mi&s;carriages; it then manife&s;tly appearing to them, and all others (who
were not wilfully blind) that the Bill of Exclu&s;ion was carried on with that
Violence, to facilitate the Dethro|ning of the King and his Succe&s;&s;or, who
had ventured his Blood as frankly both by Sea and Land, in the Good of the
Country, as the meane&s;t Subject in it; and had manife&s;ted his unalterable
Loyalty and Affection to his Ma|je&s;ty and his Subjects, by reducing
<HI>Scotland</HI> to Obedience, who&s;e Conduct in that Affair was both wi&s;e
and pro&s;perous.</P>
<P><PB N="420" REF="442">Now, when the Nation had &s;carce wiped
their Eyes dry for the Blood of the incompa|rable Father, they were ready to be
drowned again in Tears for the Murder of the &s;ucceed|ing Son, if their
Cruelty had been effected. The Rage of tho&s;e Rebels in the Long Parlia|ment
had only the Blood of one King for its Gratification; but here the Rebels
intended to have glutted their Thir&s;t of Blood, by mur|thering Two at one
Blow, the King with his Royal Brother: And to give their Inhumanity the
highe&s;t A&s;cent, they were preparing to murder a Prince who&s;e augu&s;t
Maje&s;ty had not only enobled the Nation, and once more re&s;to|red it from
its lo&s;t Reputation abroad, but made his own Kingdom (as he then had Rea&s;on
to think) an Ark of Safety at home, when almo&s;t all other Chri&s;tian Nations
were deluged in Blood and Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Who would have imagined a De&s;ign &s;hould be laid to murder
that King, the Blood of who&s;e Royal Father &s;till cried for Vengeance? Who
would imagine, that he who was re&s;tored almo&s;t by a Miracle, when the
People of <HI>Eng|land</HI> ran chearfully into Obedience, and met his
Maje&s;ty with Duty and Love, and received him with triumphant Ho&s;anna's,
with many Prote&s;tations of Sorrow for their former Mi&s;|carriages, and with
many Vows of Loyalty and Obedience? Who would have thought, after &s;o many
Promi&s;es of making him a Glorious King! After &s;uch Acts of Indemnity
granted to &s;uch Mon&s;ters of Rebels! After &s;uch Profu&s;ions 
<PB N="421" REF="443"> of royal Bounty to &s;uch unde&s;erving Villains! After
&s;o many Profe&s;&s;ions of the Care they would have for the Pre&s;ervation of
his &s;acred Life! After &s;o many &s;pecious Addre&s;&s;es of his mo&s;t
Dutiful and Loyal Subjects, as they cal|led them&s;elves? Who, I &s;ay, would
imagine, that after all this, any Man could be found to con&s;pire to murder
his &s;acred Maje&s;ty? As if all his Conde&s;cen&s;ions and Favours had been
Injuries to make Repri&s;als upon his Life; and then re&s;olved to revenge his
Death upon others, when they were doing it them&s;elves. In the Bill of
Exclu&s;ion, the Duke of <HI>York</HI> was to be &s;et a&s;ide for the King's
Pre&s;ervation; but in this Plot the King was to be murdered for the Duke's
&s;ake; and both King and Duke being taken in the &s;ame Dilemma (after the
Pre&s;byterian Lo|gick) were to be &s;acrificed: And had their Con&s;piracy
taken Effect, they would &s;o far have extenuated the Matter, that Cutting of
Throats would only be called a <HI>Scotch</HI> Way of Trimming, and the
De&s;truction of the King and Duke, to be no more but a perfecting the Work of
entire Reformation: And if this Con|&s;piracy had &s;ucceeded, it would have
put an End to our national Con&s;titution, and a Period to the very
Fundamentals of all human Society.</P>
<P>I know no Deliverances come nearer to tho&s;e of King
<HI>David,</HI> than tho&s;e wonderful Delive|rances of this King: Fir&s;t from
his E&s;cape at <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> and from &s;o many <HI>Sheba's</HI> and
<HI>Achi|tophels,</HI> which God from time to time wrought for him; which
perhaps no Age, no State, no <PB N="422" REF="444"> Hi&s;tory can &s;hew the
like: But this Con&s;piracy was the more terrible, in that <HI>Achitophel</HI>
was in the Head of it, who had corrupted and debauched the counterfeit
<HI>Ab&s;alom. Achitophel!</HI> that fal&s;e and treacherous Villain; that
dextrous Man at Wickedne&s;s; that cunning crafty Politician, who had been
Pre&s;ident of the King's Council, who was e&s;teemed as an Oracle! That
hardened Trai|tor, who &s;tole away, that he might die in his Bed, when it was
Pity that &s;uch an inveterate and advi&s;ing Rebel &s;hould have died any
other Way, than by the Hand of Ju&s;tice, which he had certainly done without
an <HI>Ignoramus Jury,</HI> when the highe&s;t Trea&s;on was formed by &s;uch
working Heads, and conducted by &s;uch poli|tick Coun&s;els; for it was not
only countenan|ced and abetted by the <HI>Faeces</HI> of the People, but was
really incouraged by &s;ome of the No|bility, who had affronted his Maje&s;ty,
by Pe|titioning, Prote&s;ting, and Caballing, which gave the &s;editious
Faction a full A&s;&s;urance, that they were powerful enough to overturn the
Mo|narcy, their De&s;ign being to be executed by &s;uch de&s;perate Villains,
that nothing le&s;s could be ex|pected, than the Kingdom's inevitable Ruine,
had not the King been miraculou&s;ly pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>But how &s;hameful a thing was it, that Per|&s;ons of Birth and
Quality &s;hould conde&s;cend to be Tools, and to creep in the Du&s;t, to
humour a ba&s;e, unworthy, di&s;loyal Faction, taken out of the Dregs of the
People? That they &s;hould endeavour to extingui&s;h that Light from whence
they derived their own Lu&s;tre, and to &s;hine <PB N="423" REF="445"> only by
the Favour of an incon&s;tant heady Mul|titude, and the King's Death (however
it hap|pened) was to be put upon the <HI>Roman</HI> Catho|licks; and tho&s;e
Rebels had a Per&s;on ready to take upon him the Government, who&s;e
Pre|&s;umption in the next Reign, owning his fal&s;e Title to the Crown,
brought him to end his Life upon a Scaffold, in&s;tead of a Throne, which he
aimed at; and if he had gained his Point, he had entailed War and Blood to our
unborn Po&s;terity; again&s;t which no Caution could certainly be too great,
nor again&s;t that Di&s;temper from which we were &s;o miraculou&s;ly
recovered, when there was no Cau&s;e to fear the Lo&s;s of Religion, Liberty,
and Property; neither did they believe them&s;elves, who pre|tended to be
afraid of them. The Moderation of a Prince was never more &s;hewed than by this
King, who then &s;uffered &s;o much licenti|ous Talk to pa&s;s unpuni&s;hed;
and there ap|peared fewer Grievances in his Time than had ever been before, and
<HI>England</HI> &s;eemed never more happy than at this Time: And it was a
&s;trange Ingratitude of tho&s;e who &s;eemed ill at Ea&s;e un|der &s;o
temperate a Government, who were yet &s;o numerous in the Hou&s;e of Commons,
that they out-voted the be&s;t Men in it; which made the King often prorogue
them, which proved fatal to his Succe&s;&s;or, tho' this King did all that was
po&s;&s;ible, to keep his People in Peace whil&s;t he lived, and to leave them
&s;o when he died; which puts me in Mind of a prophetical Saying of this King
to me, &s;ome Years before his Death.</P>
<P><PB N="424" REF="446">About two Years before the Death of King
<HI>Charles</HI> II. he gave me Leave to come into <HI>England,</HI> and &s;ent
the <HI>Katherine</HI> Yacht to <HI>O&s;tend</HI> for me. Some Days after my
Arrival at <HI>White|hall,</HI> he commanded me to walk with him to <HI>Hyde
Park;</HI> and as I walked with him (the re&s;t of the Company keeping at a
good Di&s;tance) he told me, that I had &s;erved him very well at
<HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> and that his Brother had given him a very good Account
of my Carriage towards him there. His Maje&s;ty then told me, that I had
&s;erved him as Agent and Re&s;ident for many Years; and tho' he con&s;tantly
u&s;ed to change his Mini&s;ters, at lea&s;t their Station, every three Years;
that yet I had &s;erved him &s;o much to his Satisfaction, that he was
re&s;olved never to remove me from <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> whil&s;t he lived,
e&s;pe|cially during the Wars in <HI>Flanders,</HI> becau&s;e I had always
given him a very particular Account of them, and that I knew that Country very
well, and the Intere&s;t of all the great Men in it; and that I was there very
well approved of, and that my Diligence and Activity in his Ser|vice had been
very con&s;iderable in tho&s;e trou|ble&s;ome Times: And, after having a&s;ked
me many Que&s;tions about the Nobility of tho&s;e Countries, he &s;aid, that
during his Exile abroad, he had &s;een many Countries, of which none plea&s;ed
him &s;o much as that of the <HI>Fle|mings,</HI> which were the mo&s;t hone&s;t
and true|hearted Race of People that he had met with; and then added, <HI>but I
am weary of travelling, I am re&s;olved to go abroad no more: But when</HI> 
<PB N="425" REF="447"> <HI>I am dead and gone, I know not what my Bro|ther will
do: I am much afraid, that when he comes to the Crown, he will be obliged to
travel again: And yet I will take Care to leave my Kingdoms to him in Peace,
wi&s;hing he may long keep them &s;o. But this hath all of my Fears, little of
my Hopes, and le&s;s of my Rea&s;on; and I am much afraid, that when my Brother
comes to the Crown, he will be obliged again to leave his native Soil.</HI>
This Di&s;cour&s;e of the King's I have often remembered with much Grief and
Sorrow, which hath been &mdash; true in all its Circum&s;tances: And certainly
had this King loved Bu&s;ine&s;s as well as he under&s;tood it, he had been the
greate&s;t Prince of his Time.</P>

<P><PB N="426" REF="448">About this time, &s;everal

&s;hewed them my Lord <HI>Sunderland</HI>'s Letter to me, which, it &s;eems,
had &s;uch Influence upon &s;ome of them, that the next Day, when the Duke of
<HI>Mon|mouth</HI> went from <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> to the Prince of
<HI>Orange</HI>'s Camp, which he did very frequently, and the Prince of
<HI>Orange</HI> had given a general Order, that whenever the Duke of

pa&s;&s;ed by them, nor their Companies; of which Neglect the Duke of

&s;harply reprehended them for not obeying his Orders; who thereupon told the
Prince, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Re&s;ident had given them Orders not to do
it. Whereat the Prince was very angry; which being told me by &s;ome of the

my Lord <HI>Sunderland</HI>'s Letter in my Pocket. But when I came to the

Orders to the Officers of his Army not to &s;tand to their Arms when the Duke

had done no more than &s;hewed them the Letter, I had done no more than my
Duty, and that it was the Fault of his Officers in not obeying his Commands:
That for the King of <HI>England,</HI> he might do what he plea&s;ed, in
