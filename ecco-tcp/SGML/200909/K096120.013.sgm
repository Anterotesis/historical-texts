<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXIV.</HI> Livadia continued.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE Athens continued independent, the &s;tage was ennobled by the glorious produce of Attic genius; by the &s;olemn chorus; by a <HI>Sopho|cles,</HI> and a <HI>Maenander.</HI> When Rome had prevailed, it was degraded and pro&s;tituted to the &s;avage combats of gladiators; and in the time of <HI>Trajan,</HI> the Athe|nians exceeded even the Corinthians in their reli&s;h of that cruel pa&s;time.</P>
<P>In the rock above the theatre, is a large cavern, the front ornamented with marble pila&s;ters of the Corinthian order, &s;upporting an entablature, on which are three in&s;criptions. Over that in the middle is a female figure, which had lo&s;t its head in the year 1676, mounted on two or three &s;teps &s;e|dent. On one &s;ide is a marble &s;un-dial, moved away from its proper po&s;ition. It is of a kind an|ciently
<PB N="4" REF="4">
very common, as is evident from the great number &s;till in u&s;e about Athens, particularly in the tract called <HI>the gardens,</HI> where many are &s;et on the mud walls, often with very rude gnomons. Above the cavern are two columns, &s;tanding on the &s;teep &s;lope, between the foot of the ca&s;tle-wall, and the &s;edent figure. The Greeks have converted the cave into a chapel, which is called <HI>the Virgin of the Grotto.</HI> The &s;ides of the rock within, are covered with holy por|traits. The door is rarely open; but I was once pre&s;ent, &s;ays <HI>Chandler,</HI> at the celebration of ma&s;s, when it was lighted up with wax-candles, and filled with &s;moke of incen&s;e, with bearded prie&s;ts, and a devout croud; the &s;pectacle &s;uiting the place, which is at once &s;olemn and romantic.</P>
<P>At &s;ome di&s;tance from the theatre of <HI>Bacchus,</HI> begins an outwork of the fortre&s;s, &s;tanding on an|cient arches, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the remains of a por|tico, connected with the theatre called the Odeum. This fabric was de&s;igned by <HI>Pericles,</HI> for the mu&s;ical conte&s;ts, which he regulated and introduced at the Panathancean &s;olemnity. It contained many rows of &s;eats and marble columns. The roof was con&s;tructed with the ma&s;ts and yards of Per&s;ian &s;hips, and formed to imitate the pavilion of <HI>Xerxes.</HI> Here was the tri|bunal of the archives, or chief magi&s;trate; and here the Athenians li&s;tened to the rhap&s;odi&s;ts rehear&s;ing
<PB N="5" REF="5">
the poems of <HI>Homer,</HI> and to the &s;ongs in prai&s;e of the patriots <HI>Harmodius,</HI> and <HI>Ari&s;togiton,</HI> and <HI>Thra&s;ybulus. Ari&s;tion</HI> and <HI>Sylla</HI> &s;et it on fire; the former, when he fled to the Acropolis, becau&s;e the timber would have enabled the enemy to rai&s;e machines for an attack, without lo&s;s of time. It was re&s;tored by king <HI>Ario|zanes;</HI> and in a &s;table is an in&s;cription, which has belonged to a &s;tatue of him, erected by the per&s;ons whom he appointed the over&s;eers. This fabric was roofed with cedar; and Greece had not a rival to it in dimen&s;ions and magnificence. The wall of the inner front of the Pro&s;cenium is &s;till &s;tanding, very lofty, with open arches; and beyond it, a portion of the exterior wall of the right wing is vi&s;ible. On the right hand, within the gate, is the way into the area, which was &s;own with wheat; as was al&s;o the circular &s;weep of the hill on which the &s;eats once ranged. The Dervi&s;hes have a place of wor&s;hip above, with a room, in which the bow-&s;tring, when a Turk is &s;en|tenced to be &s;trangled, is commonly admini&s;tered.</P>
<P>By the &s;ide of the mountain of the Acropolis, nearly oppo&s;ite to the rock of the Aeropagus, is a large, naked, &s;emicircular area or terrace, &s;upported by &s;tones of a va&s;t &s;ize, the face cut into &s;quares. The de&s;cent into the area is by hewn &s;teps, and the rock within is &s;moothed down perpendicularly in front, ex|tending to the &s;ides; not in a &s;trait line, but with an
<PB N="6" REF="6">
obtu&s;e angle at the &s;teps. This place, &s;ays <HI>Chandler,</HI> has been mi&s;taken for the Areopagus, and for the Odeum, but was the Pnyx.</P>
<P>Pnyx, was a place of public a&s;&s;embly, not boa&s;ting the curious labour of a theatre, but formed with the &s;implicity of primitive times. There the citizens met to tran&s;act their affairs; and by law no per&s;on could be crowned el&s;ewhere, on a decree of the people. The bu&s;ine&s;s was done afterwards in the theatre of <HI>Bacchus;</HI> but they continued to chu&s;e the magi&s;trates, and to vote the praetor in Pnyx, which was hallowed by command of an oracle. The furniture, on record, is a &s;tone or altar; on which, certain oaths were taken: a pulpit for the orators; and a &s;un-dial made on the wall. The pulpit, which before looked to|wards the &s;ea, was turned contrary by the thirty tyrants, who con&s;idered naval dominion as the parent of democracy. Excepting the acce&s;&s;ion of &s;oil, with the removal of the altar, the pulpit, and the &s;un-dial; Pnyx may be deemed to have undergone no very material alteration. It had formerly many hou&s;es about it; and the region of the city was called by its name.</P>
<P>We proceed now to another magnificent fabric, in the vicinity of the Acropolis; the temple of <HI>The&s;eus.</HI> This temple is of the Doric order; and in
<PB N="7" REF="7">
the &s;tyle of its architecture, greatly re&s;embles the Par|thenon, or temple of <HI>Minerva.</HI> Though a very an|cient fabric, it is entire, except the roof, which is modern and vaulted, with an aperture or two for the admi&s;&s;ion of light. The pavement has been removed, and the walls are bare. It is a Greek church, dedi|cated to St. George. A rece&s;s for the &s;acramental table has been erected as in the Parthenon, but in the Pronaos; and decorated with portraits of Saints. The entrance is in the &s;ide of the cell, at a low door, which is kept locked, except on the fe&s;tival when ma&s;s is celebrated. It is plated with iron, and much bat|tered; the Turks firing at it with bullets, to try the force of their powder, the goodne&s;s of their pieces, or their own dexterity at a mark. In the corner with|in &s;tands a circular marble, which has &s;erved as a fount. From the in&s;criptions which range in four columns, it appears to have belonged to the Pytra|neum.</P>
<P>The &s;culptures &s;till extant about this temple, though much impaired, witne&s;s the hand of a ma&s;ter, and furni&s;h abundant proof that <HI>Pericles</HI> was its owner. The exploits of this hero and of <HI>Hercules,</HI> were carved on the Metopes, in &s;ixteen compartments, in <HI>alto relievo,</HI> and the following &s;ubjects are intelligible: viz. <HI>The&s;eus</HI> killing the &s;ow of <HI>Crommyon;</HI> throwing <HI>Sciron</HI> from a rock into the &s;ea; wre&s;tling with <HI>Cer|cyon;</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="8">
de&s;troying the Minotaur; driving the bull of Marathon to Athens; <HI>Hercules</HI> &s;trangling the Nemaean lion; with <HI>Jolaus</HI> de&s;troying the hydra; receiving the golden apples from a nymph, one of the He&s;|perides.</P>
<P>At &s;ome di&s;tance from the Acropolis, in the plain, is a marble gate, which &s;eparated Hadrianopolis, or New Athens. It is related, that <HI>The&s;eus</HI> erected a column on the i&s;thmus of Corinth, which remained above an hundred years to the time of <HI>Codrus,</HI> when it was demoli&s;hed by the Peloponne&s;ians. It had in|&s;criptions in Greek; on one &s;ide, "Here is <HI>Pelopon|ne&s;us</HI> not <HI>Ionia;"</HI> and on the other, "Here is not <HI>Peloponne&s;us</HI> but <HI>Ionia."</HI> The gate &s;erving as a boun|dary, is in&s;cribed in capitals in like manner. Over the arch on another &s;ide, "What you &s;ee is Athens, the old city of <HI>The&s;eus;"</HI> and on the other front, "What you &s;ee, is the city of <HI>Hadrian,</HI> not of <HI>The&s;eus!</HI></P>
<P>This fabric, which is of the Corinthian order, with the tower of the winds, and other &s;tructures at Athens, is &s;een to di&s;advantage, from the acce&s;&s;ion of &s;oil round about it. Beyond it, within the region of new Athens, is the maje&s;tic ruin of the temple of <HI>Jupiter Olympius.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="9"><HI>Deucalion,</HI> was &s;aid to have erected the fir&s;t temple of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> on this &s;pot; and the place of his burial was &s;hewn near it, to prove he had lived at Athens. <HI>Pi&s;i&s;tratus,</HI> the &s;econd founder, dying, his &s;on carried on the work; but after they were &s;lain, &s;o many dif|ficulties occurred, that it remained unfini&s;hed for ages; a &s;pecimen of the only temple in the whole world, de&s;igned, with a grandeur worthy of the ruler of Heaven; and exciting a&s;toni&s;hment in every be|holder. About four hundred years after, <HI>Antiochus</HI> promi&s;ed to complete it, and <HI>Co&s;&s;utius,</HI> a Roman ar|chitect, was extolled for his noble ideas of magnitude in the cell, and for di&s;po&s;ing the columns, and the en|tablature, with an exact &s;ymmetry, which te&s;tified his exqui&s;ite knowledge and &s;kill. The temple was a dipteros and hypaethros, or with double rows of columns, and open to the &s;ky; though not as was mo&s;t common, with ten, but with eight columns in front. Rome afforded no example of this &s;pecies. It was one of the four marble edifices which had rai&s;ed to the pinnacle of renown, the architects who planned them; men, it is &s;aid, admired in the a&s;|&s;embly of the gods, for their wi&s;dom and excellence.</P>
<P><HI>Sylla,</HI> when he puni&s;hed Athens, dared to plunder even <HI>Jupiter Olympius,</HI> and removed columns and brazen hou&s;holds to adorn the capital of Rome. The &s;tructure &s;till continuing imperfect; the kings, in al|liance
<PB N="10" REF="10">
with <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> agreed to fini&s;h it by contribu|tion, and jointly dedicate it to the genius of the em|peror. It was re&s;erved for <HI>Hadrian,</HI> to put the la&s;t hand to a work, on which Athens had expended &s;even thou&s;and and eighty-eight talents. In our e&s;timate of the gold which decked the &s;tatue of <HI>Minerva,</HI> in the Parthenion, we &s;aid, forty-four talents were equi|valent to an hundred and twenty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling. Let it be judged then, what an immen&s;e &s;um this fabric, the work of ages, mu&s;t have co&s;t; little &s;hort of eight millions &s;terling. This atchive|ment of the emperor, was celebrated in a hymn &s;ung at the &s;acrifice, when he dedicated the temple to <HI>Ju|piter,</HI> more than &s;even hundred years after its foun|dation by <HI>Pi&s;i&s;tratus.</HI></P>
<P>The ruin of the temple of <HI>Jupiter Olympius,</HI> con|&s;i&s;ts of prodigious columns, tall and beautiful, of the Corinthian order, &s;luted; &s;ome &s;ingle, &s;ome &s;upport|ing their architraves; with a few ma&s;&s;ive marbles be|neath; the remnant of a va&s;t heap, which only many ages could have con&s;umed and reduced into &s;o &s;canty a &s;ub&s;tance. The columns are of very extraordinary dimen&s;ions, being about &s;ix feet in diameter, and near &s;ixty in height. The number without the cell, was one hundred and &s;ixteen, or twenty; &s;eventeen were &s;tanding in 1676. One was overturned a few years before we arrived, &s;ays <HI>Chandler,</HI> with much difficulty;
<PB N="11" REF="11">
and applied to the building of a new mo&s;que, in the Bazar, or market-place. It was an angular column, and of con&s;equence in determining the dimen&s;ions of the fabric.</P>
<P>New Athens, was &s;upplied with water, by the mu|nificence of <HI>Hadrian,</HI> from remote &s;ources at a va&s;t expence. He founded a very exten&s;ive aque|duct, of which, many piers are yet &s;tanding. The water was partly conveyed by a duct running along the &s;ide of the adjacent hill, and di&s;tributed to the town from a re&s;ervoir or ci&s;tern, cut in the rock, and fronted with an arcade of marble, of the Ionic order. One half of this remains; it &s;tands beneath the moun|tain of St. George, and is about a mile from the gate of Hadrian. The &s;pace between, where once was New Athens, is now ploughed and &s;owed.</P>
<P>On the left hand, returning from the aqueduct, is the bed of the Ili&s;&s;us; and higher up, the junction of that and the Eridanus. The water of this river was &s;o bad, that the cattle would &s;carcely drink of it. The Ili&s;&s;us is now, as it ever was, an occa&s;ional torrent. In &s;ummer it is quite dry. During our re&s;idence at Athens, I &s;everal times vi&s;ited the bed, after &s;now had fallen on the mountains, or heavy rain, hoping to &s;ee it filled to the margin, and ru&s;h|ing along with maje&s;tic violence; but never found
<PB N="12" REF="12">
even the &s;urface covered; the water lodging in the rocky cavities, and trickling from one to another.</P>
<P>And here it may be remarked, that the poets who celebrate the Ili&s;&s;us, as a &s;tream laving the fields, cool, lucid, and the like, have both conceived, and con|veyed, a fal&s;e idea of this renowned water-cour&s;e. They may be&s;tow a willow fringe on its naked mar|gin, amber waves on the muddy Maenander, and hanging woods on the bare rock of Delphi, but the foundation in nature will be wanting; nor, indeed is it ea&s;y for a de&s;criptive writer, when he exceeds the &s;phere of his own ob&s;ervation, to avoid falling into local ab&s;urdities and untruths.</P>
<P>We have now given a &s;urvey of the mo&s;t &s;triking ruins in Athens. Two &s;tructures yet remain, either omitted or mentioned inexplicitly by other writers, which we &s;hall ju&s;t touch upon. One is the tower of the winds, or of <HI>Andronicus Cyrrhe&s;tes.</HI> The other is a Doric portal, &s;ituated at the foot of the hill of the Acropolis.</P>
<P>The tower of <HI>Andronicus Cyrrhe&s;tes,</HI> is a &s;mall edi|fice of marble, an octagon, decorated with &s;culpture, repre&s;enting the winds; eight in number, and has &s;up|ported a Triton, which turned as a weather-cock, and pointed with a wand to the wind then blowing. On
<PB N="13" REF="13">
the &s;ides, were &s;un dials to &s;hew the hour of the day. It is mentioned by <HI>Varro</HI> and <HI>Vitruvius.</HI></P>
<P>The Tower of the Winds is now a place of wor|&s;hip belonging to a college of Dervi&s;hes. I was pre|&s;ent with my companions, &s;ays <HI>Chandler,</HI> at a reli|gious function, which concluded with their wonder|ful dance. The company was &s;eated on goat-&s;kins on the floor cro&s;s-legged; forming a large circle.</P>
<P>The chief Dervi&s;h, a comely man, with a gray beard and of fine pre&s;ence, began the prayers, in which the re&s;t bore a part; all pro&s;trating them&s;elves as u&s;ual, and &s;everal times touching the ground with their foreheads. On a &s;udden, they leaped up, threw off their outer garments, and joining hands, moved round &s;lowly to mu&s;ic, &s;houting <HI>Alla,</HI> the name of God. The in&s;truments &s;ounding quicker, they kept time, calling out <HI>Alla. La illa ill Alla. God. There is no other God but God.</HI> Other &s;entences were added to the&s;e, as their motion encrea&s;ed; and the chief Dervi&s;h, bur&s;ting from the ring into the middle, as in a fit of enthu&s;ia&s;m, and letting down his hair be|hind, began turning about, his body poi&s;ed on one of his great toes as on a pivot, without changing place. He was followed by another who &s;pun a different way, and then by more, four or five in number. The rapidity with which they whirled round was gradu|ally
<PB N="14" REF="14">
augmented, and became amazing; their long hair not touching their &s;houlders, but flying off; and the circle &s;till &s;urrounding them, &s;houting, and throw|ing their heads backwards and forwards; the dome re-echoing the wild and loud mu&s;ic and noi&s;e, as it were, of frantic bacchanals. At length &s;ome quitting the ring and fainting, at which time it is believed they are favoured with extatic vi&s;ions, the &s;pectacle end|ed. We were &s;oon after introduced into a room furni&s;hed with &s;kins for &s;ofas, and entertained with pipes and coffee, by a chief Dervi&s;h, whom we found, with &s;everal of his performers, as cool and placid as if he had been only a looker on.</P>
<P>The Doric portal may be &s;een, with its in&s;crip|tions, in <HI>The Ruins of Athens.</HI> One of the&s;e informs us, that the people erected the fabric with the dona|tions made to <HI>Minerva,</HI> by the god <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> and his &s;on, the god <HI>Augu&s;tus.</HI> From the plan and pro|portions of the ruin, it has been inferred, that the fabric to which the portal belonged, was not a tem|ple. An edict of the emperor <HI>Hadrian,</HI> in&s;cribed on the jamb of a door-ca&s;e, regulating the &s;ale of oil, and the duties to be levied on it, has been urged in favour of the opinion that the portal was the en|trance of the inclo&s;ure of the Agora or market-place, mentioned by <HI>Strabo</HI> to have been in a di&s;trict of the city called <HI>Etreria.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="15">The territory of Athens was anciently well peopled. The &s;mall towns were in number 174; &s;cattered, except &s;ome con&s;tituting the city, about the country. Fre|quent traces of them are found; and &s;everal &s;till exi&s;t, but mo&s;tly reduced to very incon&s;iderable villages. Many of the ancient wells al&s;o occur all over Attica. Some are &s;een in the vineyards and gardens, nearly in their pri&s;tine &s;tate; a circular rim of marble, about a yard high, &s;tanding on a &s;quare pavement, adorned, not in-elegantly, with wreathed flutings on the out&s;ide; or plain, with mouldings at the top and bottom; the inner &s;urface deep worn by the friction of ropes. The highe&s;t is a kettle, a jar, or the &s;kin of a goat or kid di&s;tended; and clo&s;e by is commonly a trough or hollow &s;tone, into which they pour water for the cattle. The city was &s;upplied with corn from Sicily and Africa; and the regard of the emperors and kings, its patrons, was di&s;played in large&s;&s;es of wheat and barley to be di&s;tributed generally in the Ordeum. At pre&s;ent Attica is thinly inhabited, and probably pro|duces grain &s;ufficient for the natives; but the edicts pro|hibiting exportation, are continually eluded, and public di&s;tre&s;s, bordering on famine, en&s;ues almo&s;t yearly.</P>
<P>The olive trees are now, as anciently, a principle &s;ource of the riches of Athens. The wood of the&s;e trees, watered by the Cephi&s;&s;us about three miles from the city, has been computed at lea&s;t &s;ix miles long.
<PB N="16" REF="16">
The mills for grinding and pre&s;&s;ing the olives are in the town. The oil is depo&s;ited in large earthen jars, &s;unk in the ground in the areas before the hou&s;es. The crops had failed for five years &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, &s;ays <HI>Chandler,</HI> when we arrived. The cau&s;e a&s;&s;igned was a northerly wind, which de&s;troyed the flower. The fruit is &s;et, in about a fortnight, when the appre|hen&s;ion from this unpropitious quarter cea&s;es. By a law of <HI>Solon,</HI> no tree could be planted le&s;s than five feet, nor an olive, or fig tree, le&s;s than nine feet from one of another proprietor.</P>
<P>The honey, as well as the oil of Attica, was antiently in high repute. Many encomiums are extant on that of <HI>Hymetteus,</HI> and it de&s;erves them all. Flies are remarked to buzz about it, without &s;ettling, which has been attributed to the odour it derived from thyme. The race of bees was &s;aid to have been originally produced in Hymettus, and to have &s;warmed from thence, in numerous colonies, to people other regions. The mountain furni&s;hes a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of aromatic plants, herbs and flowers, pecu|liarly adapted to maintain them both in &s;ummer and winter. The hives are &s;et on the ground in rows, enclo&s;ed within a low wall. Their form and manage|ment, and the method of taking the comb without de&s;troying the in&s;ect, has been de&s;cribed by <HI>Wheeler.</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="17">
By a law of <HI>Solon,</HI> no per&s;on was allowed to place a &s;tand within three hundred yards of one before e&s;ta|bli&s;hed.</P>
<P>The purple hills of Hymettus, were the &s;cene of the famous &s;tory of <HI>Cephalus</HI> and <HI>Procris,</HI> in <HI>Ovid.</HI> The fatal mi&s;take of the hu&s;band was &s;aid to have hap|pened among &s;ome thickets, near a &s;acred &s;pring or fountain. This &s;eems the &s;pot called Pera; where was a temple of <HI>Venus,</HI> and a water, which was believed to conduce to pregnancy, and an ea&s;y delivery. The &s;ame, it is probable, is now occupied by the mona&s;tery of Cyriani. In many in&s;tances, the temple or its &s;ite, with the con&s;ecrated portion, have changed their owners; and the deity been di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the &s;aint. The convent is an old irregular building, on the &s;ide of the greater Hymettus, in view from Athens; en|compa&s;&s;ed by a wall with battlements, and entered by a low iron door. The Greek women repair to it at particular &s;ea&s;ons; and near it is a fountain much extolled for its virtues.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXV.</HI> Ancient and pre&s;ent State of Athens, with the Character, Manners, Cu&s;toms, and Dre&s;s of the Inhabitants.</HEAD>
<P>ATHENS has on the We&s;t &s;ide of the plain, the mountains Aegaleos and Parnes; on the North, Brile&s;&s;us; on the North-ea&s;t, about &s;ix miles di&s;tant, Pentele; and next the Aegaean &s;ea, Hymettus. The clouds, attracted by &s;ome of the&s;e mountains, antiently furni&s;hed a variety of progno&s;tics for the weather; while clouds above the mountains on the &s;ide of Hy|mettus, portended ruin. If in the night, a long cloud guided it beneath the top, the rain generally continued for &s;ome days. A long cloud re&s;ting on Hymettus in winter, pre-&s;ignified a violent &s;torm. At the &s;etting of the &s;even &s;tars, called <HI>Vergiliae,</HI> lightning about Parnes, Brile&s;&s;us, and Hymettus, if all were compre|hended, denoted a great &s;torm; if two, a le&s;&s;er; but if Parnes alone, &s;evere weather. A &s;torm en&s;ued, if clouds enveloped that portion of Parnes, which was towards Zephyrus or the We&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="19">A day or two after the &s;torm before-mentioned, &s;ays <HI>Chandler,</HI> the capuchin, as we were conver&s;ing by the window of his apartment, put his hand incau|tiou&s;ly on the frame, and &s;uddenly withdrawing it complained of a painful puncture; a Turk who was with us, on examining the wall, found a &s;corpion of a pale green colour, and near three inches long, which he cru&s;hed with his foot, and bound on the part affected, as an antidote to its own poi&s;on. The &s;mart became incon&s;iderable after the remedy was applied; and as no inflammation followed, &s;oon cea&s;ed. The &s;ting, if neglected, produces acute pain, attended with a fever and other &s;ymptoms for &s;everal hours, until the pa|roxy&s;m is over; when, the malignity of the virus, as it were decaying, the patient is left gradually free. Some pre&s;erve &s;corpions in oil, in a vial, to be u&s;ed, if that which commits the ho&s;tility &s;hould e&s;cape; though it &s;eldom happens, but on turning up a log or &s;tone, another may be found to &s;upply its place.</P>
<P>Athens was the parent of philo&s;ophy as well as of eloquence, and had three celebrated Gymna&s;ia without the city, the Academy, the Lyceum, and Cyno&s;arges; from which, as many &s;ects dated their origin, the Platonic, the Peripatetic, and the Cynic; followers of <HI>Plato,</HI> of <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> and of <HI>Anti&s;thenes. Zeno,</HI> in&s;tituted the Stoic philo&s;ophy in the portico
<PB N="20" REF="20">
named <HI>Poecile;</HI> and <HI>Epicurus</HI> had his garden in the city.</P>
<P>The academy was in the &s;uburb without Dipy|lon, di&s;tant from Athens only three quarters of a mile. It was once the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a private per&s;on named <HI>Academus,</HI> who gave it to the people. <HI>Hip|parchus,</HI> &s;on of <HI>Pi&s;i&s;tratus</HI> &s;urrounded it with a wall. <HI>Crinon</HI> drained the low grounds near it. The &s;pot, parched and &s;qualid, was improved and rendered very plea&s;ant. The walks were &s;haded with tall plane trees, and cooled by running water. Before the en|trance was an altar of love. <HI>Plato</HI> commenced teach|ing at the academy, then reputed unwhol&s;ome. After|wards he preferred a &s;mall garden by the Colonus Hippius, his own property. The Lacedemonians &s;pared the academy when they ravaged Attica; but <HI>Sylla,</HI> wanting timber for machines, cut down the grove there and at the Lyceum. The &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of <HI>Plato</HI> in the academy, enjoyed a con&s;iderable reve|nue; which, in the &s;ub&s;equent ages, was greatly aug|mented by legacies, from per&s;ons de&s;irous of contri|buting to the lei&s;ure and tranquillity of the philo&s;ophic life. The little garden of <HI>Epicurus,</HI> was near the academy. The teacher of ea&s;e, it is recorded, was the fir&s;t who introduced that &s;pecies of gratification, the enjoyment of the country in town.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="21">By the de&s;truction of Dipylon and the city-wall, we are deprived of the ancient boundaries of Athens; and the town, be&s;ides being reduced in its extent, furni&s;hes a variety of avenues to the plain. More|over, the man&s;ions of the illu&s;trious dead, like the the bodies which they covered, are con&s;umed and have di&s;appeared. Time, violence, and the plough, have levelled all without di&s;tinction; equally inat|tentive to the meritorious &s;tate&s;man, the patriot, the orator, and philo&s;opher; the &s;oldier, the arti&s;t, and phy&s;ician. <HI>Atticus</HI> is de&s;cribed by <HI>Cicero,</HI> as plea&s;ed with recollecting, where the renowned Athenians had lived, or been accu&s;tomed to &s;it or di&s;pute; and as &s;tudiou&s;ly contemplating even their &s;epulchres. The traveller will regret that de&s;olation interferes, and by the uncertainty it has produced, deprives him of the like &s;atisfaction; but, in the &s;tyle of the antients, to omit the re&s;earch would merit the anger of the mu&s;es.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved, that without Dipylon, the road branched off towards the Piraeus and Eleu&s;is, as well as the academy. The road to the haven and to Eleu&s;is, divides now not far from the temple of <HI>The&s;eus;</HI> and is nearly in the &s;ame direction as for|merly. On the right-hand of the Eleu&s;inian road, is a way which leads to the &s;ite of the academy. The Turki&s;h Aga has lately erected a hou&s;e, in or near it,
<PB N="22" REF="22">
with a large garden, and a plentiful fountain by the road &s;ide; &s;upplied, it is likely, by the channels which conduced to the coolne&s;s and verdure of the old &s;uburb.</P>
<P>We proceed now to the Gymna&s;ia, on the other &s;ide of Athens; the Lyceum and Cyno&s;arges.</P>
<P>The Lyceum was &s;acred to <HI>Apollo,</HI> a proper patron, as an antient author has remarked, the God of health, be&s;towing the ability to excel in gymna&s;tic exerci&s;es. The image repre&s;ented him as re&s;ting after fatigue, with a bow in his left hand, his right-arm bending over his head. The Gymna&s;ium was erected by <HI>Lycurgus,</HI> &s;on of <HI>Lycophron.</HI> The militia of Athens paraded there, and were in&s;tructed in the management of their hor&s;es, &s;hields, and &s;pears; in forming the phalanx, and in all the e&s;tabli&s;hed modes of defence.</P>
<P>Cyno&s;arges was but a little without the city-gate. There was a temple of <HI>Hercules;</HI> on a &s;ummit near was the tomb of <HI>I&s;ocrates. Philip,</HI> who reduced the city to require aid from the Romans, encamped by Cyno&s;arges, and &s;et fire both to that place and the Lyceum.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="23">The Lyceum was beyond the Ili&s;&s;us. The &s;ite is now marked by a well and a church, and many large &s;tones &s;cattered about. Cyno&s;arges was not far from the Lyceum; and perhaps on the &s;ame &s;ide of the Ili&s;&s;us with the city, where is now a garden near this bed and by the road. The artificial currents of water having cea&s;ed, the environs of Athens are be|come more bare and naked, than they were even after the deva&s;tations of <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>Sylla.</HI></P>
<P>Athens maintained under the Romans, its reputa|tion for philo&s;ophy and eloquence; and continued, though &s;ubdued, the metropolis of learning, the &s;chool of art, and the centre of ta&s;te and genius. The Gymna&s;ia, and the gardens of the philo&s;ophers were decorated with the capital works of eminent ma&s;ters, and &s;till frequented. The fierce warrior was capti|vated by Greece and Science; and Athens humanized and poli&s;hed the conquerors of the world. But <HI>Sylla</HI> greatly injured the city, by tran&s;porting to Rome the public library, which had been founded by <HI>Pi&s;i&s;tratus,</HI> carefully augmented by the people, removed by <HI>Xerxes</HI> into Per&s;ia, and re&s;tored long after by <HI>Seleu|cus Nicanor.</HI> The &s;pirit of learning drooped on the lo&s;s; and the Roman youth, under <HI>Tiberius,</HI> were &s;ent to &s;tudy at Mar&s;eilles, in&s;tead of Athens. Even there the barbarous Gauls joined in the pur&s;uit of eloquence and philo&s;ophy. The &s;ophi&s;t, as well as the
<PB N="24" REF="24">
phy&s;ician, was hired to &s;ettle among them; and the na|tion was civilized by the Greek city.</P>
<P>The emperor <HI>Hadrian,</HI> embelli&s;hed Athens with a noble library, and a new gymna&s;ium, and re&s;tored &s;cience to its ancient &s;eat. <HI>Lollianus,</HI> an Ephe&s;ian, was fir&s;t rai&s;ed to the high dignity of the &s;ophi&s;tical throne, which was afterwards filled by <HI>Atticus Herodes,</HI> and other eminent and illu&s;trious per&s;ons. The num|ber of profe&s;&s;ors was increa&s;ed by <HI>Antoninus</HI> the phi|lo&s;opher, who had &s;tudied under <HI>Herodes.</HI> His e&s;ta|bli&s;hment con&s;i&s;ted of thirteen; two Platoni&s;ts, as many Peripatics, Stoics, and Epicureans, with two Rhetoricians and Civilians; and a pre&s;ident &s;tiled <HI>Prefect of the Youth.</HI> The &s;tudent proceeded from the philo&s;opher to the rhetorician, and then to the civilian. A yearly &s;alary of about four hundred and &s;ixty-eight pounds, was annexed to each of the philo&s;o|phic chairs; and one of a talent to tho&s;e of the civi|lians.</P>
<P>Education now flouri&s;hed in all its branches at Athens. The Roman world re&s;orted to its &s;chools, and reputation and riches awaited the able preceptor. The tender mind was duly prepared for the manly &s;tudies of philo&s;ophy and eloquence. Age and pro|ficiency were followed by promotion. The youth was advanced into the higher cla&s;&s;es, enrolled with the philo&s;ophers, and admitted to their habit. The
<PB N="25" REF="25">
title of &s;ophi&s;t was conferred on him, when mature in years and erudition; and this was an honour &s;o much affected, that the attainment of it almo&s;t fur|ni&s;hed an apology for in&s;olent pride, and extravagant elation. It was a cu&s;tom for the ma&s;ters to in&s;cribe on marble, the names of their &s;cholars. Some &s;peci|mens of the&s;e regi&s;ters are pre&s;erved in the Oxford collection, and many fragments are yet extant in Athens.</P>
<P>At this period Athens abounded in philo&s;ophers. It &s;warmed, according to <HI>Lucian,</HI> with clokes and &s;taves and &s;atchels; you beheld every where a long beard, a book in the left-hand, and the walks full of companies, di&s;cour&s;ing and rea&s;oning The cloke, or Tribonium, was the habit of all the orders. The general colour was dark, but the Cynic wore white, and, with the Stoic, had the folds doubled. One &s;houlder was bare; the hair hanging down; the beard un&s;haven. The Cynic, with the Stoic and Pythagorean, was &s;lovenly and negligent; his cloke in tatters, his nails long, and his feet naked. The Cynic was armed with a &s;taff, as a defence from the dogs, or the rabble. The &s;ophi&s;t was adorned with purple, and commonly poli&s;hed, as well in dre&s;s and per&s;on, as in manners and language. It behoved the profe&s;&s;or, as <HI>Lucian</HI> affirms, to be hand&s;omely clothed, to be &s;leek and comely, and above all to
<PB N="26" REF="26">
have a flowing beard, in&s;piring tho&s;e who approached him, with veneration; and &s;uitable to the &s;alary he received from the emperor.</P>
<P>A learned father, who was cotemporary with <HI>Ju|lian,</HI> at Athens, has de&s;cribed the manner in which the Novice was treated on his arrival there, with the ceremony of initiation. He was fir&s;t &s;urrounded with the pupils and partizans of the different &s;ophi&s;ts, all eager to recommend their favourite ma&s;ter. He was ho&s;pitably entertained; and afterwards the &s;tu|dents were allowed to attack him with rude or inge|nuous di&s;putation, as each was di&s;po&s;ed. He was next to be inve&s;ted with the habit. A proce&s;&s;ion in pairs, at equal di&s;tances, conducted him through the Agora, to a public bath. An oppo&s;ition was feigned on their approach to the door, &s;ome calling out and forbidding his admi&s;&s;ion, &s;ome urging on and knock|ing. The&s;e prevailed. He was introduced into a warm cell, wa&s;hed, and then clothed with the Tribo|nium. He was &s;aluted as an equal, on his coming out, and re-conducted. No one was &s;uffered to ap|pear in that dre&s;s at Athens, without the permi&s;&s;ion of the &s;ophi&s;t, and this ceremony, which was attended with con&s;iderable expence.</P>
<P>The philo&s;ophers were long as di&s;tingui&s;hed by their aver&s;ion to Chri&s;tianity, as by their govern|ment.
<PB N="27" REF="27">
It is recorded of <HI>Ju&s;tin Martyr,</HI> that he preached in the Tribonium, to which he had been admitted before his conver&s;ion. The e&s;tabli&s;hment of Chri&s;tianity deeply affected the pro&s;perity of Athens. A gradual de&s;ertion of the place followed. <HI>Minerva</HI> could no longer protect her city. Its beauty was violated by the Pro-con&s;ul, who &s;tripped Poecile of its precious paintings. It was for&s;aken by good fortune, and would have lingered in decay, but the barbarians interpo&s;ed, and &s;uddenly completed its downfall. When the Goths were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, in the time of <HI>Clodius,</HI> they ama&s;&s;ed all the books, intending to burn them, but de&s;i&s;ted on a repre|&s;entation, that the Greeks were diverted, by the amu&s;ements of &s;tudy, from military pur&s;uits. <HI>Ala|ric,</HI> under <HI>Arcadius,</HI> was not afraid of their be|coming &s;oldiers. The city was pillaged, and the li|braries were con&s;umed. Deva&s;tation then reigned within, and &s;olitude without its walls. The &s;weet &s;wain; the vocal nightingales, as the &s;ophi&s;ts are fondly &s;tyled, were heard no more. Philo&s;ophy and eloquence were exiled, and their ancient &s;eat occu|pied by ignorant honey-factors of mount Hymettus.</P>
<P>Athens, after it was abandoned by the Goths, continued, it is likely, for ages, to pre&s;erve the race of its remaining inhabitants unchanged, and uniform in language and manners. Hi&s;tory is &s;ilent of its
<PB N="28" REF="28">
&s;ufferings from later incur&s;ions, from wars and ma&s;|&s;acres. Plenty, and pro&s;pect of advantage, produces new &s;ettlers; but, where no trade exi&s;ts, employ|ment will be wanting; and Attica was never cele|brated for fertility. The plague has not been, as at Smyrna, a frequent vi&s;itant; becau&s;e the intercour&s;e &s;ub&s;i&s;ting with the i&s;lands, and other places, has been &s;mall, and the port is at a di&s;tance. The plague, de|&s;cribed by <HI>Thucidides,</HI> began in the Piraeus, and the Athenians at fir&s;t believed that the enemy had poi|&s;oned the wells. If from inadvertence the infection be now admitted into the town, the Turks, as well as the Greeks, have the prudence to retire to their hou&s;es in the country, or to the mona&s;teries; and it &s;eldom prevails, either &s;o long or &s;o terribly, as in cities on the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>A colony of new proprietors was introduced into the city by <HI>Mahomet</HI> the &s;econd; but the people &s;e|cured &s;ome privileges by their capitulation, and have &s;ince obtained more by addre&s;s, or money. The Turk has favoured the &s;pot, and be&s;towed on it a milder tyranny. The Vaiwode purcha&s;es his go|vernment yearly, but circum&s;pection and moderation are requi&s;ite in exacting the revenue, and the u&s;ual concomitants of his &s;tation are uncea&s;ing apprehen&s;ion and danger. The impatience of oppre&s;&s;ion, when general, begets public vengeance.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="29">The Turks of Athens are in general more polite, &s;ocial, and affable, than is common in that &s;tately race; living on more equal terms with their fellow-citizens, and partaking, in &s;ome degree, of the Greek cha|racter. The &s;ame intermixture, which has &s;oftened their au&s;terity, has corrupted their temperance; and many have foregone the national ab&s;tinence from wine; drinking freely, except during their Ramazan, or Lent. Some too after a long lap&s;e have re-a&s;&s;umed, and rigidly adhere to it; as &s;uiting the gravity of a beard, and the decorum of paternal authority. Se|veral of the families date their &s;ettlement from the taking of the city. They are reckoned at about three hundred. Their number, though comparatively &s;mall, is more than &s;ufficient to keep the Chri&s;tians fully &s;en&s;ible of their ma&s;tery. The Turks po&s;&s;e&s;s from their childhood, an habitual &s;uperiority, and awe with a look the loftie&s;t va&s;&s;al. Their deportment is often &s;tern and haughty. Many in private life are di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;trict honour, by punctuality, and uprightne&s;s in their dealings; and almo&s;t all by ex|ternal &s;anctity of manners. If they are narrow-minded in the extreme, it is the re&s;ult of a confined education, and an avaritious temper is a natural con|&s;equence of their rapacious government.</P>
<P>The Greeks may be regarded as the repre&s;enta|tives of the old Athenians. On our arrival in the
<PB N="30" REF="30">
Piraeus, an Archon came to meet us. The learned reader may perhaps be &s;truck by that re&s;pectable title, and annex to it &s;ome portion of its cla&s;&s;ical im|portance; but the Archons are now meer names, ex|cept a tall fur cap, and a fuller and better dre&s;s than is worn by the inferior cla&s;&s;es. Some have &s;hops in the Bazar, &s;ome are merchants or farmers' of the public revenue. The families &s;tyled archontic, are eight or ten in number, mo&s;tly on the decline. The ordinary habit of the meaner citizens is a red &s;kull-cap, a jacket, and a &s;a&s;h round the middle; loo&s;e breeches or trow&s;ers, which tie with a large knot before; and a long ve&s;t, which they hang on their &s;houlders, lined with wool, or fur, for cold weather. By following the lower occupations, they procure, not without difficulty, a pittance of profit to &s;ub&s;i&s;t them, to pay their tribute-money&punc; and to purcha&s;e garments for the fe&s;tivals; when they mutually vie in appearing well-clothed, their pride even exceeding their poverty.</P>
<P>The lordly Turk and lively Greek neglecting agri|culture, and even pa&s;turage, this department which in A&s;ia Minor is occupied by the Turcomans, has been obtained in Europe by the Albanians or Albane&s;e. The&s;e are a people remote from their original coun|try, which was by the Ca&s;pian Sea, &s;preading over, and cultivating alien lands; and as of old, addicted
<PB N="31" REF="31">
to univer&s;al hu&s;bandry, and to migration. It is chiefly their bu&s;ine&s;s to plough, &s;ow and reap; dig, fence, plant and prune the vineyard; attend the watering of the olive-tree; and gather in the harve&s;t; going forth before the dawn of day, and returning joyous in the evening, on the clo&s;e of their labour. If &s;hepherds, they live on the mountains, in the vale, or the plain, as the varying &s;ea&s;ons require; under arbours or &s;heds covered with boughs, tending their flocks abroad, or milking the ewes and &s;he-goats at the fold, and making chee&s;e and butter to &s;upply the city. Inured early to fatigue and the &s;un, they are hardy and robu&s;t; of manly carriage, very different from that of the fawning ob&s;equious Greek, and of very de&s;perate bravery, under every di&s;advantage, when compelled by nece&s;&s;ity or oppre&s;&s;ion. Their habit is &s;imple and &s;uccinct, reaching to the knees. They have a national language, and are members of the Greek communion.</P>
<P>The Chri&s;tians in Athens, both Greeks and Alba|nians, are more immediately &s;uperintended by the archbi&s;hop, and by the two epitropi or curators, who are cho&s;en from among the principal men, and venerable for their long beards. The&s;e endeavour to quiet all di&s;putes, and prevent the parties from recurring to the &s;evere tribunal of the Cadi, or Turki&s;h judge; watching over the commonwealth, and regu|lating
<PB N="32" REF="32">
its internal policy, which &s;till retains &s;ome faint and ob&s;cure traces of the ancient popular form, though without dignity or importance. A traditional &s;tory is related at Athens, and in the Ea&s;t, to illu&s;trate the native quickne&s;s of apprehen&s;ion; which, as if tran&s;|mi&s;&s;ive and the property of the &s;oil, is inherited even by the lower cla&s;&s;es of people. A per&s;on made trial of a poor &s;hepherd whom he met with his flock, demanding in Greek, from whence he came, where go|ing, who he was, and the number of his flock, thus; <HI>from whence? and where? and who? and how many?</HI> He was an&s;wered without he&s;itation, and with equal brevity, in the &s;ame language. <HI>From Athens, to Livadia, Theo|dore, and five hundred.</HI> In the citizens this aptitude not being duly cultivated, in&s;tead of producing ge|nius, degenerates into cunning. They are ju&s;tly re|puted a mo&s;t crafty, &s;ubtle, and acute race. It has been joco&s;ely affirmed, that no Jew can live among them, becau&s;e he will be continually outwitted. They are con&s;cious of their &s;ubjection to the Turks, and as &s;upple as depre&s;&s;ed, from the memory of the blows on the feet, and indignities which they have expe|rienced, or &s;een inflicted, and from the terror of the penalty annexed to re&s;i&s;tance, which is the forfeiture of the hand uplifted: but their di&s;po&s;ition, as an|ciently, is unquiet; their repo&s;e di&s;turbed by factious intrigues and private animo&s;ities; the body politic weakened by divi&s;ion, and often impelled in a di|rection
<PB N="33" REF="33">
oppo&s;ite to its true intere&s;t. They have two &s;chools, one of which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a &s;mall collection of books, and is entitled to an annual payment from Venice, the endowment of a charitable Athenian, but the money is not regularly remitted.</P>
<P>The liberty of the fair &s;ex at Athens, is almo&s;t equally abridged by the Turks and Greeks. Their hou&s;es are &s;ecured with high walls, and the windows turned from the &s;treets, and latticed, or boarded up, &s;o as to preclude all intercour&s;e, even of the eyes. The <HI>haram,</HI> or apartment of the Turki&s;h women, is not only impenetrable, but mu&s;t not be regarded on the out&s;ide with any degree of attention. To ap|proach them when abroad, will give offence; and in the town, if they cannot be avoided, it is the cu&s;tom to turn to the wall, and &s;tand &s;till, without looking towards them, while they pa&s;s. This mode of car|riage is good breeding at Athens.</P>
<P>The Turki&s;h women in this city, claim an ex|emption from their confinement, on one day only in the week; when they vi&s;it their relations, and are &s;een going in companies to the baths, or &s;itting in the burying grounds on the graves of their friends, their children, hu&s;bands, or parents. They are then enwrapped and beclothed in &s;uch a manner, it is im|po&s;&s;ible to di&s;cern whether they are young or old,
<PB N="34" REF="34">
hand&s;ome, or ugly. Their heads, as low as the eye-brows, are covered with white linen, and al&s;o their faces beneath; the prominency of the no&s;e and mouth giving them nearly the vi&s;ages of mummies. They draw down a veil of black gauze over their eyes, the moment a man or boy comes in view. They wear &s;hort loo&s;e boots of leather, red or yellow, with a large &s;heet over their common garments, and ap|pear, as in Con&s;tantinople, very bulky.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of the Greek matrons, is a garment of red or blue cloth, the wai&s;t very &s;hort, the long pet|ticoat falling in folds to the ground. A thin flowing veil of mu&s;lin, with a golden rim or border, is thrown over the head and &s;houlders. The attire of the virgins is a long red ve&s;t, with a &s;quare cape of yellow &s;attin hanging down behind. They walk with their hands concealed in the pocket-holes at the &s;ides, and their faces are muffled. Sometimes they a&s;&s;ume the Turki&s;h garb. Neither prudence nor mode&s;ty &s;uffers a maiden to be &s;een by the men before &s;he is married. Her beauty might inflame the Turk, who can take her legally by force, to his bed on a &s;en|tence of the Cadi, or judge; and the Greek, if &s;he revealed her face to him, even unwillingly, would reject her as criminal, and with di&s;dain.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="35">The Albanian women, in Athens, are inured early to hard living, labour and the &s;un. Their fea|tures are injured by penury, and their complexions by the air. Their dre&s;s is coar&s;e and &s;imple; a &s;hift reaching to the ancle, a thick &s;a&s;h about the wai&s;t, and a &s;hort loo&s;e woollen ve&s;t. Their hair is platted in two divi&s;ions, and the ends fa&s;tened to a red &s;ilken &s;tring; which, with a ta&s;&s;el, is pendant to their heels, and frequently laden with pieces of &s;ilver coin, of various &s;izes, dimini&s;hing gradually to the bottom. Among the&s;e the antiquarian may often di&s;|cover medals of value. They are &s;een carrying water on their backs, in earthen jars, with handles; wa&s;h|ing by the fountains, or a&s;&s;embled by the Ili&s;&s;us, after rain, with the female &s;laves of the Mahometans, and other &s;ervants; treading their linen, or beating it with a piece of heavy wood, &s;preading it on the ground or bu&s;hes to dry, and conveying it to and fro in panniers, or wicker-ba&s;kets, on an a&s;s. Their legs and feet are generally bare; and their heads hooded, as it were with a long towel, which encircles the neck, one extremity hanging down before, and the other behind. The girls wear a red &s;kull-cap, plated with peraus, or Turki&s;h pennies of &s;ilver per|forated, and ranged like the &s;cales of fi&s;h.</P>
<P>The Greek will &s;ometimes admit a traveller into his gynecaeum, or the apartment of his women.

The&s;e within doors, are, as it were, unca&s;ed, and each a contra&s;t of the figure &s;he made when abroad. There the girl, like <HI>Thetis,</HI> treading on a &s;oft carpet, has her white and delicate feet naked; the nails tinged with red. Her trow&s;ers, which in winter, are of red cloth, and in &s;ummer of fine callico, or thin gauze, de&s;cend from the hip to the ancle, hanging loo&s;ely about her limbs; the lower portion embroidered with flowers, and appearing beneath the &s;hift, which has the &s;leeves wide and open, and the &s;eams and edges curiou&s;ly adorned with needle-work. Her ve&s;t is of &s;ilk, exactly fitted to the form of the bo&s;om, and the &s;hape of the body; which it rather covers than conceals, and is &s;horter than the &s;hift. The &s;leeves button occa&s;ionally to the hand, and are lined with red or yellow &s;attin. A rich zone encom|pa&s;&s;es her wai&s;t, and is fa&s;tened before by cla&s;ps of &s;ilver gilded, or of gold &s;et with precious &s;tones. Over the ve&s;t is a robe, in &s;ummer lined with ermine, and in cold weather with fur. The head-dre&s;s is a &s;kull-cap, red or green, with pearls; a &s;tay under the chin, and a yellow forehead-cloth. She has bracelets of gold on her wri&s;ts; and, like <HI>Aurora,</HI> is ro&s;y-figured, the tips being &s;tained. Her necklace is a &s;tring of zechins, a &s;pecies of gold coin, or of the pieces called byzantines. At her cheeks is a lock of hair, made to curl towards the face; and down her back falls a profu&s;ion of tre&s;&s;es &s;preading over her

&s;houlders. Much time is con&s;umed in combing and braiding the hair, after bathing; and, at the greater fe&s;tivals, in enriching and powdering it with &s;mall bits of &s;ilver gilded, re&s;embling a violin in &s;hape, and woven in at regular di&s;tances. She is painted blue round the eyes; and the in&s;ides of the &s;ockets, with the edges, on which the la&s;hes grow, are tinged with black.</P>
<P>For colouring the la&s;hes and &s;ocket of the eye, they throw incen&s;e, or gum of Labdanum, on &s;ome coals of fire, intercept the &s;moke which a&s;cends, with a plate, and collect the foot. This, &s;ays <HI>Chandler,</HI> I &s;aw applied. A girl &s;itting cro&s;s-legged as u&s;ual, on a &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a, and clo&s;ing one of her eyes, took the two la&s;hes between the fore-finger and thumb of her left hand, pulled them forward, and then thru&s;ting in, at the external corner, a bodkin, which had been immer&s;ed in the foot, and extracting it again, the particles before adhering to it, remained within, and were pre&s;ently ranged round the organ; &s;erving as a foil to its lu&s;tre; beads contributing, as they &s;ay, to its health, and increa&s;ing its apparent magnitude.</P>
<P>The improvement of the mind and morals, is not con&s;idered as a momentous part of female education at Athens. The girls are taught to dance, to play on the Turki&s;h guittar, and the tympanum, or timbrel,
<PB N="38" REF="38">
and to embroider, an art in which they generally excel. A woman &s;killed in reading and writing, is &s;poken of as a prodigy of capacity and learning. The mother of <HI>O&s;man Aga,</HI> a Turk, &s;ays <HI>Chandler,</HI> who vi&s;ited our hou&s;e, was of this rare number, as he often told us; &s;o terrible for her knowledge, that even <HI>Achmet Aga</HI> her kin&s;man, had been &s;een to tremble when he received her annual vi&s;it. In com|mon life, the woman waits on her hu&s;band, and after dre&s;&s;ing the provi&s;ions, which he purcha&s;ed, eats perhaps with a female &s;lave; the &s;tately lord feeding alone, or in company with men.</P>
<P>Provi&s;ions of all kinds are good and cheap, at Athens. The frequent and &s;evere fa&s;ts, impo&s;ed by the Greek church, have an influence on the market. The Chri&s;tians are often, by the tenets of their reli|gion, confined to vegetables, or to things without blood; &s;uch as &s;nails, which they gather from the &s;treets, the cutle-fi&s;h, or &s;ea-polypus. The latter, called by the Greeks octopodes, from the number of its feet, is beaten to make it tender; and, when boiled, is white, like the tail of a lob&s;ter, but has not much flavour. Hares, game, and fowl, may be purcha&s;ed for little more than the value of the powder and &s;hot. Oranges, lemons, and citrons, grow in the gardens. The grapes and melons are ex|cellent, and the figs were celebrated of old. The wines
<PB N="39" REF="39">
are whole&s;ome; but the pitch infu&s;ed to pre&s;erve them, communicates a ta&s;te to which &s;trangers are not perfectly reconciled.</P>
<P>When the figs ripen, a very &s;mall bird, called by the Italians, <HI>becea-figo,</HI> by the Greeks <HI>&s;ycophas,</HI> ap|pears, and is continually &s;ettling on the branches of the tree, and pecking the fruit. If frightened away, they return almo&s;t immediately, and a per&s;on &s;itting in the corn, or concealed by a thicket, may fire with little intermi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>They are eaten roa&s;ted entire, each in a vine leaf, and are accounted a great delicacy. When the olives blacken, va&s;t flights of doves, pigeons, thru&s;hes, and other birds, repair to the groves for food. Wild turkies are not rare. The red-legged partridge, with his numerous brood, ba&s;ks in the &s;un, or &s;eeks &s;hade among the ma&s;tic bu&s;hes. They are fond of the ber|ries in the &s;ea&s;on, and have then a &s;trong, but not di&s;agreeable ta&s;te, In winter, woodcocks abound; de&s;cending, after &s;now, on the mountains, into the plain; e&s;pecially on the &s;ide of the Cephi&s;&s;us, and as &s;uddenly retiring. If the weather continues &s;evere, and the ground be frozen, they enter the gardens of the town in great di&s;tre&s;s, rather than cro&s;s the &s;ea; and are &s;ometimes taken with the hand. Snipes, teal, widgeon, ducks, and the like, are al&s;o foundin plenty.
<PB N="40" REF="40">
A hor&s;e or a&s;s is commonly provided by &s;port&s;men, who go in a party, to bring home what they kill.</P>
<P>Hares are exceedingly numerous. Calling is prac|ti&s;ed, in &s;till weather, from the latter end of May, to about the middle of Augu&s;t. Three or four men in a company, &s;tand &s;ilent and concealed, in a thicket, with guns pointed in different directions. When all ready, the caller applies his fingers to his lips; and &s;ucking them, at fir&s;t &s;lowly, and then fa&s;ter, produces a &s;queak|ing &s;ound; when the hares within hearing ru&s;h to the &s;pot. In this manner many are &s;laughtered in a day. One of my companions, &s;ays <HI>Chandler,</HI> with two or three Greeks, who were adepts, killed eleven; among which was a female big with young. The&s;e animals are &s;aid to a&s;&s;emble together, to leap and play, at the full of the moon; and, it is likely, the &s;hep|herds, who live much abroad, ob&s;erving and li&s;tening to them, learned to imitate their voices, to deceive, and make them thus fooli&s;hly abet their own de&s;truc|tion.</P>
<P>The wild bea&s;ts which find &s;helter in the moun|tains, greatly annoy the &s;hepherds; and their folds are con&s;tantly guarded by &s;everal large fierce dogs. The per&s;on who killed a wolf, was entitled, by a law of <HI>So|lon,</HI> to a reward; if a female, to one drachm, about &s;even-pence halfpenny; if a male, to five drachms.
<PB N="41" REF="41">
Afterwards a talent, or one hundred and eighty pounds &s;terling, was paid for a young wolf; and double that &s;um for a full grown. The pea&s;ant now produces the &s;kin in the <HI>Bazar,</HI> or market, and is recompen&s;ed by voluntary contributions. Parnes, the mountain to|wards the Cephi&s;&s;us, is haunted, be&s;ides wolves, by deer and foxes, as it formerly was by wild boars and bears. The &s;port&s;men lie in ambu&s;h by the &s;prings, which they frequent, waiting their approach in the du&s;k of the evening. <HI>Pliny</HI> mentions the deer bred about Parnes and Brile&s;&s;us, as remarkable for four kidneys, and the hares as having two livers. The latter peculiarity, in &s;ome which we purcha&s;ed, was much noticed by our Swi&s;s, who once brought the two livers for my in&s;pection The youth of Athens were anciently trained to hunting, as a u&s;eful and manly exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>A place, where the fair &s;ex bears no part in &s;ociety, will be ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;ed dull and uniform. Indeed, a Turk is generally a &s;olemn, &s;olitary being; with few vi|&s;ible enjoyments, except his pipe and coffee. The for|mer is his con&s;tant companion. It is his &s;olace on the &s;opha; and, when &s;quatting on his hams, as he is &s;ome|times &s;een, in the &s;hade, by the door of his hou&s;e: or in a group, looking on, while the hor&s;es, which are &s;taked down with a rope, feed, in the &s;ea&s;on, on the green corn. When he is walking, or riding, it is car|ried
<PB N="42" REF="42">
in his hand, or by an attendant. The tube is of wood perforated, commonly long and pliant; and &s;ometimes hung with &s;mall &s;ilver cre&s;cents and chains, with a mouth-piece of amber. The bowl is earthen, and a bit of al&s;e wood put into it, while he is &s;moak|ing, augments his plea&s;ure, yielding a grateful per|fume. A &s;ilken embroidered bag is u&s;ually tucked in at his &s;ack, by his &s;ide, and contains tobacco. His hor&s;e, his arms, and <HI>haram</HI> are the other chief objects of his attention. He is grave, &s;ententious and &s;teady, but fond of narrations, and not difficult to be overcome by a &s;tory.</P>
<P>The Turks, in this city, ob&s;erving we did not u&s;e the &s;ign of the cro&s;s, and being informed that we di&s;approved of the wor&s;hipping of pictures or images, conceived, &s;ays <HI>Chandler,</HI> a favourable opinion of us. Their abhorrence of hog-fle&s;h is unfeigned; and we derived &s;ome popularity from a report, which we did not contradict, that we held it in equal dete&s;ta|tion. Several of them frequented our table. The principal Turks came all to our hou&s;e at night, while it was Ramazan or Lent, when they fa&s;t in the day|time; and were entertained by us, with &s;weat-meat, pipes, coffee, and &s;herbet, much to their &s;atisfaction, though di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by our chairs; &s;ome trying to col|lect their legs under them, on the &s;eats, and &s;ome &s;quatting down by the &s;ides. When we vi&s;ited them,
<PB N="43" REF="43">
adds <HI>Chandler,</HI> we were received with cordiality, and treated with di&s;tinction. Sweet gums were burned in the middle of the room, to &s;cent the air; or &s;cattered on coals before us, while &s;itting on the &s;ofa, to perfume our mu&s;taches and garments; and at the door, on our departure, we were &s;prinkled with ro&s;e-water. The vaiwode, at certain &s;ea&s;ons, &s;ent his mu&s;icians to play in our court. The Greeks were not le&s;s civil; and at Ea&s;ter we had the company of the archons, in a body. Several of them al&s;o ate often with us, and we had daily pre&s;ents of flowers, &s;ometimes per|fumed, of pomegranates, oranges and lemons fre&s;h gathered, pa&s;try, and other like articles.</P>
<P>The Turks have few public games, or &s;ports. We were pre&s;ent at a foot race, and a wre&s;tling match, provided by a rich Turk, for the entertainment of his &s;on and other boys, who were about to be cir|cumci&s;ed. A train, headed by the vaiwode, and pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">niple men on hor&s;es, richly capari&s;oned, at|tended by the boys, who were all neatly dre&s;&s;ed, their white turbans glitering with tin&s;el ornaments, to a place without the city, where carpets were &s;pread for them on the ground, in the &s;hade; and a multi|tude of &s;pectators waited &s;ilent and re&s;pectful. The race was &s;oon over, and the prizes were di&s;tributed; to the winner a &s;ufficient quantity of cloth for an upper garment; to the next a live &s;heep; to the third
<PB N="44" REF="44">
a kid; to the fourth a huge water-melon. The com|pany then removed to a level &s;pot, the ruin of the temple of <HI>Jupiter Olympius,</HI> and formed a large circle. The wre&s;tlers were naked, except a pair of clo&s;e drawers, and were anointed all over with oil.</P>
<P>Some Arabian and black &s;laves, who had obtained their freedom, and were &s;ettled at Athens, had a fea&s;t on the performance of the rite of the circumci|&s;ion. The women danced in a ring with &s;ticks in their hands; and turning in pairs, cla&s;hed them over their heads, at intervals, &s;inging wildly to the mu&s;ic. A couple then danced with ca&s;tanets; and the other &s;warthy ladies, &s;itting cro&s;s-legged on a &s;ofa, began &s;moaking.</P>
<P>Athens was anciently enlivened by the choru&s;es &s;ing|ing and dancing in the open air, in the front of the temples of the gods, and round their altars; at the fe&s;tival of <HI>Bacchus,</HI> and on other holidays. The Greeks are frequently &s;een, engaged in the &s;ame exerci&s;e, generally in pairs, e&s;pecially on the anniver|&s;aries of their &s;aints, and often in the areas before their churches. Their common mu&s;ic is a large tabour and pipe; or a lyre and tympanum, or timbrel. Some of their dances, are undoubtedly of remote an|tiquity. One has been &s;uppo&s;ed, that which was
<PB N="45" REF="45">
called the <HI>Crane,</HI> and was &s;aid to have been invented by <HI>The&s;eus;</HI> after her e&s;cape from the labyrinth of Crete. The pea&s;ants perform it yearly in the &s;treet of the French convent, at the conclu&s;ion of the vin|tage; joining hands, and preceeding their mules and a&s;&s;es, which are laden with grapes in panniers, in a very curved and intricate figure; the leader waving a handkerchief, which has been imagined to denote the clew given by <HI>Ariadne.</HI> A grand circular dance, in which the Albanian women join, is exhibited on certain days, near the temple of <HI>The&s;eus;</HI> the com|pany holding hands, and moving round the mu&s;icians, the leader footing and capering until he is tired, when another takes his place. They have al&s;o choral dances.</P>
<P>Marriages are commonly announced by loud mu|&s;ic, at the hou&s;e of the bridegroom. A Turk or Greek neither &s;ees nor &s;peaks to the maiden before|hand; but for an account of her per&s;on and di&s;po&s;i|tion, relies on his female relations; who have op|portunities of &s;eeing her in their vi&s;its, and at the bath. The Turk, when terms are adju&s;ted with her family, ratifies the contract before the Cadi, or judge, and her pre&s;ents. If he be rich, a band of mu&s;icians pre|cede a train of pea&s;ants, who carry each a &s;heep, lamb, or kid, with the horns gilded, on their &s;houl|ders; and the&s;e are followed by &s;ervants, with co|vered
<PB N="46" REF="46">
ba&s;kets on their heads, containing female orna|ments, money, and the like, for her u&s;e; and by &s;laves to attend her. Years often intervene, before he requires her to be brought to his home. The &s;treets through which &s;he is to pa&s;s, are then left free; and &s;he is conducted to his hou&s;e, under a large canopy, &s;urrounded by a multitude of women, all wrapped in white, with their faces muffled. If a Turk finds a pair of papouches, or &s;lippers, at the door of his <HI>haram,</HI> it is a &s;ign that a &s;tranger is within, and he mode&s;tly retires. That apartment is even a &s;anctuary for fe|males flying from the officers of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The Papas, or prie&s;t, reads a &s;ervice at the Greek weddings, the two per&s;ons &s;tanding and holding each a wax taper lighted. A ring and gilded wreath, or crown is u&s;ed; and, at the end of the ceremony, a little boy, or girl, as previou&s;ly agreed on, is led to the bride, and ki&s;&s;es her hand. She is then, as it were, enthroned in a chair, and the hu&s;band remains at a re&s;pectful di&s;tance, with his hands cro&s;&s;ed, &s;ilen and looking at her; until the women enter and take her away, when the men carou&s;e in a &s;eparate apart|ment. Her face and hands are gro&s;sly daubed over with paint; and &s;ometimes the corehead and cheeks are bedecked with leaf-gold.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="47">The Albanians convey the bride to the hou&s;e of her hu&s;band, in proce&s;&s;ion, on hor&s;eback, with a chid a&s;tride behind her; a loo&s;e veil or canopy concealing her head and face; her fingers laden with &s;ilver rings, and her hands painted red and blue, in &s;treaks. Their dre&s;s is a red jacket, hand&s;omely embroidered, with a coloured turban. The entertainments, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, con&s;i&s;t of a great variety of di&s;hes, chiefly pa&s;try; ranged in &s;ummer, under a long low ar|bour, made with boughs; the company &s;itting on the ground. When the bride is to be removed to a place at a di&s;tance, &s;ome women dance before her to the end of the town.</P>
<P>The wife of a Turk, who lived near us, dying, we were alarmed, &s;ays <HI>Chandler,</HI> on a &s;udden, with a terrible &s;hriek of women, and with the loud expo&s;|tulations of the hu&s;band. She was carried to the grave at day-break. The Greeks bury in their churches on a bier. The bones, when room is wanting, are wa&s;hed with wine, in the pre&s;ence of the neare&s;t male relation, and then removed. I was pre&s;ent at a funeral entertainment, provided by one of the archons, who&s;e daughter had been recently in|terred. The proce&s;&s;ion &s;et out from his hou&s;e, be|fore &s;un-ri&s;e, headed by a papas, or prie&s;t, and &s;ome deacons, with lighted candles; the women who were left behind, &s;creaming and howling. One man
<PB N="48" REF="48">
bore a large wax-taper, painted with flowers, and with the portrait of the decea&s;ed in her u&s;ual attire, and hung round with a handerchief of her embroi|dering, in gathers. Two followed, carrying each on their heads, a great di&s;h of parboiled wheat; the &s;urface, blanched almonds, di&s;po&s;ed in the figure of a dove, with gilding, and a border of rai&s;ins and pomegranate kernels. The&s;e, on our arrival at the church, were depo&s;ited over the body. The matins ended, with a &s;ervice appropriated to this ceremony, and read by the prie&s;t near the &s;pot. The di&s;hes were then brought round, and each per&s;on in his place took a portion, and was afterwards helped in turn to a &s;mall gla&s;s of white brandy, called <HI>raki,</HI> or of wine. The wax-taper, with the handkerchief, was &s;u&s;pended from the cieling, as a memorial of the girl repre&s;ented on it; and &s;ome peraus, or &s;ilver pennies, were di&s;tributed to the poor who attended.</P>
<P>The Turks are a people never yet illuminated by &s;cience. They are more ignorant than can ea&s;ily be conceived. The lei&s;ure of the Greeks is chiefly em|ployed in reading legendary &s;tories of their &s;aints, tran&s;lated into the vulgar tongue. This, and their nation, they &s;tyle <HI>the Romano.</HI> It has a clo&s;e affinity with the ancient language, which they call the Hel|lenic; but the grammar and &s;yntax are much cor|rupted. They &s;peak rapidly, and curtail many of
<PB N="49" REF="49">
their words, which are farther depraved by incorrect &s;pelling. Their pronuciation differs widely from the Engli&s;h. They have no knowledge of the old quan|tity of &s;yllables, but adhere to the accents, and com|po&s;e ver&s;es in rhyme, with great facility. I enquired for manu&s;cripts, and was told of &s;ome belonging to the mona&s;tery of S. Cyriani on mount Hymettus. The&s;e were &s;hewn me, with &s;everal books printed by <HI>Aldus,</HI> negligently &s;cattered on the floor, in a loft at Athens, where the <HI>Hegumenos,</HI> or Abbot re&s;ided.</P>
<P>Credulity and &s;uper&s;tition prevail at Athens, and all over the Ea&s;t. The traveller may &s;till hear of Medeas, women po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of magic power, and ex|pert in various modes of incantation. Amulets, or charms, are commonly worn to repel any malignant influence. Children are &s;een with cro&s;&s;es, or thin flat bits of gold, called phylacteries, hanging about their necks, or on their foreheads. The Turks in|&s;cribe words from the Koran. The Greeks confide in holy water, which is &s;prinkled yearly on their hou&s;es, by a prie&s;t, to purify them, and to drive away any daemon, who may have obtained entrance. The in&s;ides of &s;everal of their churches are covered with repre&s;entations of the exploits of their &s;aints, painted on the walls; extravagant, ridiculous, and ab&s;urd beyond imagination. The old Athenian had
<PB N="50" REF="50">
a multitude of deities, but relied chiefly on <HI>Minerva;</HI> the modern has a &s;imilar troop headed by his fa|vourite Panag&eacute;a. He li&s;tens with devout humility to fanciful tales of nightly vi&s;ions, and of miracles vouch&s;afed on the mo&s;t trivial occa&s;ions. The re|port is propagated, and if, on examination, the for|gery be detected on the &s;pot, the remoter devotee continues in his conviction, and exults in the con|templation of the &s;olid ba&s;is, on which he conceives his faith to be founded. In the fir&s;t year of our re|&s;idence in the Levant, &s;ays <HI>Chandler,</HI> a rumour was current, that a cro&s;s of &s;hining light had been &s;een at Con&s;tantinople, pendant in the air over the grand mo&s;que, once a church, dedicated to St. <HI>Sophia;</HI> and that the Turks were in con&s;ternation at the prodigy, and had endeavoured in vain to di&s;&s;i|pate the vapour. The &s;ign was interpreted to por|tend the exaltation of the Chri&s;tians above the Ma|hometans; and this, many &s;urmi&s;ed, was &s;peedily to be effected; di&s;gu&s;t and jealou&s;y then &s;ub&s;i&s;ting be|tween the Ru&s;&s;ians and the Porte, and the Georgians contending with &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t the Turki&s;h armies. By &s;uch arts as the&s;e are the wretched Greeks pre|&s;erved from de&s;pondency, rouzed to expectation, and con&s;oled beneath the yoke of bondage.</P>
<P>Before we quit Livadia, it may not be ami&s;s to mention Delphos, the modern Ca&s;tri, which was
<PB N="51" REF="51">
much re&s;orted to by the ancients on account of the temple of <HI>Apollo,</HI> and the dark cave from whence the Pythian prie&s;te&s;s u&s;ed to deliver her oracles &s;itting upon a <HI>Tripos.</HI></P>
<P>Delphos, or Delphi, &s;ays <HI>Chandler,</HI> was the chief and mo&s;t illu&s;trious city in Phocis. Its &s;anctity was deduced through a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages, from a period involved in fable and ob&s;curity. The influ|ence of its god has controlled the councils of &s;tates, directed the cour&s;e of armies, and decided the fate of kingdoms. The antient hi&s;tory of Greece, is full of his energy, and an early regi&s;ter of his authority.</P>
<P>The oracular power was &s;uppo&s;ed to re&s;ide in a deep cavern, with a &s;mall and narrow mouth, &s;aid to have been di&s;covered by goatherds, who were in&s;pired by the vapour which aro&s;e out of it, and prophe&s;ied as from <HI>Apollo.</HI> A lofty tripod, decked with laurels, was placed over the aperture. The Pythia or Prie&s;t|e&s;s, after wa&s;hing her body, and e&s;pecially her hair, in the cold water of Ca&s;talia, mounted on it to re|ceive the divine effluvia. She wore a crown of laurel, and &s;hook a &s;acred tree which grew by. Sometimes &s;he chewed the leaves; the frenzy which followed may be attributed to this u&s;age, and the gentle or more violent &s;ymptoms to the quantity taken. In one in&s;tance, the paroxy&s;m was &s;o violent, that the
<PB N="52" REF="52">
prie&s;ts and &s;uppliants ran away, and left her alone to expire, it was believed, of the god. Her part was un|plea&s;ant, but if &s;he declined acting, they dragged her by force to the tripod. The habit of her order was that of virgins. The rules enjoined temperance and cha&s;tity and prohibited luxury in apparel. The &s;ea|&s;on of enquiry was the &s;pring, after which <HI>Apollo</HI> was &s;uppo&s;ed to vi&s;it the altars of the Hyperboreans. Delphi was conveniently &s;ituated for the conflux of votaries lying in the centre of Greece, and, as was then imagined, in the centre of the univer&s;e. The god pro&s;pered in his bu&s;ine&s;s. His &s;ervants and prie&s;ts fea&s;ted on the numerous victims, and the riches of his temple were proverbial, even before the wars of Troy.</P>
<P>The enclo&s;ure of the temple was of great extent, and filled with trea&s;ures, in which many cities had con&s;ecrated tenths of &s;poils taken in war, and with the public donations of renowned &s;tates in various ages. It was the grand repo&s;itory of ancient Greece, in which the labours of the &s;culptor and &s;tatuary, gods, heroes, and illu&s;trious per&s;ons were &s;een col|lected and arranged; the inequalities of the area or acclivity, contributing to a full di&s;play of the noble a&s;&s;emblage.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="53">It was the opinion of <HI>Wheeler,</HI> that no mountain in Greece was higher than Parna&s;&s;us, on the &s;ide of which this city &s;tood; that it was not inferior to Mount Cenis among the Alps; and that, if detached, it would be &s;een at a greater di&s;tance than even Mount Athos. The &s;ummits are perpetually increa&s;ing, every new fall of &s;now adding to the perennial heap, while the &s;un has power only to thaw the &s;uperficies.</P>
<P>The water of Ca&s;talia, from which the Pythia, and the Poets who ver&s;ified her an&s;wers, were believed to derive a large &s;hare of their in&s;piration, de&s;cends through a cliff of Parna&s;&s;us; the rocks on each &s;ide high and &s;teep, ending in two &s;ummits; from one of which, the Delphians threw down the famous <HI>Ae&s;op.</HI> By the &s;tream within the cleft, are &s;mall broken &s;tairs leading to a cavity in which is water. Clo&s;e by, at the foot of the ea&s;tern precipice, is a ba&s;on with &s;teps on the margin, once it is likely the bath u&s;ed by the Pythia. The water is limpid and exceedingly cold. Returning from the village, &s;ays <HI>Chandler,</HI> in the even|ing, I began to wa&s;h my hands in it, but was in&s;tantly chilled, and &s;eized with a tremor, which rendered me unable to &s;tand or walk without &s;upport. On reach|ing the mona&s;tery, I was wrapped in a garment lined with warm fur, and drinking freely of wine, fell into a mo&s;t profu&s;e per&s;piration. This incident, when <HI>Apollo</HI> was dreaded, might have been embelli&s;hed with

<P>Adjoining to Parna&s;&s;us, is Helicon, one of the mo&s;t fertile and woody mountains in Greece. On it the fruit of the <HI>Arbutus,</HI> or Strawberry-tree, was uncommonly &s;weet; and the inhabitants affirm, that the plants and roots were all friendly to man; and that even the &s;erpents had their poi&s;on weakened by the innoxious qualities of their food.</P>
<P>The mu&s;es were the proprietors of Helicon. There was their &s;hady grove and their images; with &s;tatues of <HI>Apollo</HI> and <HI>Bacchus,</HI> and <HI>Linus</HI> and <HI>Orpheus,</HI> and the illu&s;trious poets, who had recited their ver&s;es to the harp. The vallies of Helicon, are de&s;cribed by <HI>Wheeler,</HI> as green and flowery in the &s;pring, and en|livened by plea&s;ing ca&s;cades and &s;treams, and by fountains and wells of clear water.

<P>Thiva, the ancient Thebes, was the capital of that &s;ubdivi&s;ion of Greece, called Boeotia.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXVI.</HI> A De&s;cription of the Morea, called Peloponne&s;us, by the Ancients.</HEAD>
<P>THE Morea, is almo&s;t an i&s;land, but joins to the continent, or country of Proper Greece, by a narrow neck of land, called the I&s;thmus of Corinth, &s;o famed for the I&s;thmian games, celebrated there in honour of <HI>Neptune.</HI> It anciently con&s;i&s;ted of the following &s;mall kingdoms, Sicyon, Argos and My|cene, Corinth, Proper Achaia, Arcadia and Laco|nia. Its pre&s;ent name of the Morea, is &s;aid to be derived from <HI>Morus,</HI> a Mulberry-tree; either from its re&s;embling the leaf of that tree in &s;hape, or from the great number of mulberry-trees it produces.</P>
<P>The chief rivers in it are, 1. the Carbon, anciently the Alpheus. This river the poets feigned to pa&s;s under the Ionian &s;ea, and ro&s;e again in Sicily. It ri&s;es from the mountain Stymphalus, taking its cour&s;e through Arcadia, and being joined by the rivers Celadon and Amyrinth, falls into the Ionian &s;ea. 2. Eurotas, which ri&s;ing in Arcadia, pa&s;&s;es through
<PB N="57" REF="57">
Laconia, or Lacedaemon, and di&s;charges it&s;elf in the bay of Colochina. 3. Styx, one of the rivers of Hell, according to poetic fiction, who&s;e waters are &s;o exce&s;&s;ive cold, that the drinking of them endangers a man's life. It is to the extraordinary qualities it po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es, of corroding iron and copper, that the old poets have called it the river of Hell. The Morea has not only &s;everal mountains, but al&s;o many fertile and delightful plains. At the treaty of Carlowitz, the Turks ceded all the Morea to the Venetians, but in the year 1715, again di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them of it. It is divided into four di&s;tricts.</P>
<P>Saccania or Romania Minor, contains the ancient cities of Corinth, Sicyon and Argos.</P>
<P>Corinth, by the Turks, called Gereme, is a celebrated town at the foot of Acro-Corinth, on which &s;tands a ca&s;tle, having a mo&s;t beautiful pro&s;pect on every &s;ide. The original name of this city was Ephyra, with the addition of Heliopolis, or city of the Sun; and Bima|ris, which &s;ignifies a place lying between two &s;eats. It was anciently one of the fine&s;t cities in all Greece, and abounded in &s;tately buildings; &s;uch as temples, palaces, amphitheatres, porticos, monuments, baths, and other works; all ornamented with pillars, cor|nices, and pede&s;tals, who&s;e &s;ingular decorations gave ri&s;e to the appellation of the Corinthian order, with
<PB N="58" REF="58">
numbers of &s;tatues by the greate&s;t ma&s;ters. But its edifices being demoli&s;hed at pre&s;ent, and the &s;pot on which it &s;tood, filled up with little gardens and fields; it looks much more like a village than a city: and what is &s;till wor&s;e, is frequently expo&s;ed to the de&s;cent of the Cor&s;airs. It is, however, the &s;eat of a Greek archbi&s;hop. The Chri&s;tians here, from &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in St. Paul's epi&s;tles, appear to have been very nu|merous.</P>
<P>The fertility of the country round Corinth, was alluded to by the witty oracle, which an&s;wered a per|&s;on who enquired, what he &s;hould do to become rich; that he needed only to get all the land between Corinth and Sicyon.</P>
<P>The city of Corinth, &s;ays <HI>Chandler,</HI> &s;tands on the i&s;thmus, on the &s;ide of the Peloponne&s;us, a &s;ituation once peculiarly happy, from which all its ancient pro&s;perity was derived. Its ports were commo|diou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed by nature, to receive the &s;hips of Europe and of A&s;ia, and to render it the centre of their commerce. The circumnavigation of the Pelo|ponne&s;us, was tedious and uncertain to a proverb; whil&s;t at the i&s;thmus, not only their cargoes, but, if requi&s;ite, &s;maller ve&s;&s;els could be tran&s;ported from &s;ea to &s;ea. The i&s;thmus, in the narrowe&s;t part, was only five miles over. Corinth held the keys of the
<PB N="59" REF="59">
penin&s;ula, and taxed both the ingre&s;s and egre&s;s, re|&s;embling in &s;ome mea&s;ure in this particular, the cita|del at the entrance of the Crimea. The I&s;thmian games likewi&s;e, by the concour&s;e of people at their celebration, contributed to its opulence, which was immen&s;e. The temple of <HI>Venus,</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed above a thou&s;and female &s;laves con&s;ecrated as courte&s;ans. The prodigality of the merchants made the place &s;o expen&s;ive, that it was a &s;aying, <HI>not every man could go to Corinth.</HI> The citadel was called one of the horns on which <HI>Philip</HI> was advi&s;ed to lay hold, in order to &s;ecure the hei&s;er, or the Peloponne&s;us. It has al&s;o been &s;tyled one of the fetters of Greece.</P>
<P>Various attempts have been made to open a com|munication between the Ionian and the Aegean &s;ea, by a navigable cut through the i&s;thmus. The project was adopted by <HI>Demetrius Poliorceles,</HI> but his &s;ur|veyors found the waters in the Corinthian gulf, much higher than on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, and were of opi|nion, that Aegina and the neighbouring i&s;lands would be flooded, and the canal be un&s;erviceable. It was revived by <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> and <HI>Caligula. Nero</HI> com|menced a fo&s;&s;e from Lechaeum, and advanced about half a mile. <HI>Atticus Herodes</HI> was ambitious of en|gaging in it; but, as <HI>Nero</HI> had failed, was afraid of offending the emperor by a&s;king his permi&s;&s;ion. "All tho&s;e, &s;ays <HI>Pau&s;anias,</HI> who have endeavoured to ren|der
<PB N="60" REF="60">
the Peloponne&s;us an i&s;land, have been prevented while labouring to divide the i&s;thmus. It is manife&s;t where they began digging, and the rock is untouched. As it was made originally, it remains, and is now a continent.&mdash;So difficult is it for man to force nature." The ve&s;tiges of the&s;e fruitle&s;s efforts which <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> &s;aw, in the &s;econd century, &s;ays <HI>Chandler,</HI> are &s;till extant</P>
<P>In the di&s;trict of Zachonia or Braccio di Mania, which formerly comprehended Laconia and Arcadia, &s;tands Lacedaemon or Sparta, now named Mi&s;itra. It is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been founded a thou&s;and years before the building of Rome: the form of the city was circular, and its circumference about &s;ix miles. Few cities ever attained &s;uch a height of military glory. The Spartans received their laws from <HI>Lycur|gus;</HI> the two chief magi&s;trates had the title of kings, but were in reality &s;ubject to the &s;enate; they were afterwards governed by five magi&s;trates, called the <HI>Ephori,</HI> who were depo&s;ed by <HI>Cleomenes,</HI> but, he being &s;ubdued by the Macedonians, Laconia became a province to that city.</P>
<P>The modern town of Mi&s;itra, is an epi&s;copal &s;ee, and con&s;i&s;ts of four divi&s;ions; the town, the ca&s;tle, and two large &s;uburbs. The town lies at the foot of the ca&s;tle, and con&s;i&s;ts of two &s;pacious &s;treets, with &s;everal others cro&s;&s;ing them at right angles. The old
<PB N="61" REF="61">
market-place is beautified with a noble fountain, and a church built out of the ruins of <HI>Minerva</HI>'s temple. Here are al&s;o the ruins of the gallery, or portico, built in memory of the victory obtained over the Per&s;ians, at the battle of Plateae, with &s;ome remains of the temples of <HI>Helen, Hercules,</HI> and <HI>Venus Armata;</HI> all built of white marble. Without the walls are &s;till to be &s;een the grove of Plane-trees, where the Spar|tans held their annual games and exerci&s;es.</P>
<P>Of Olympia, &s;ituated on the borders of the river Alpheus, &s;carce any ve&s;tiges are to be &s;een. This place was rendered exce&s;&s;ively illu&s;trious in the times of antient Greece, by the power and reputation of its princes; by the oracle and temple of the <HI>Olympian Jupiter;</HI> and by the renown of the Agon, or games, in which to be victorious, was deemed the very &s;um|mit of human felicity.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jupiter</HI> of Olympia, was accounted &s;ufficient to immortalize its maker <HI>Phidias.</HI> It was of ivory and gold, the head crowned with olive. In the right-hand was a &s;tatue of victory; and in the left, a flower|ed &s;ceptre, compo&s;ed of various metals, on which was an eagle. The &s;andals were of gold, as was al&s;o the ve&s;tment, which was curiou&s;ly embo&s;&s;ed with lilies and animals. The throne was gold, inlaid with ebony and ivory, and &s;tudded with jewels, intermixed with
<PB N="62" REF="62">
paintings and exqui&s;ite figures in <HI>relievo.</HI> The image impre&s;&s;ed on the &s;pectators an opinion, that it was higher and wider than it really mea&s;ured. Its magnitude was &s;uch, that though the temple was very large, the arti&s;t &s;eemed to have erred in the propor|tions. The god &s;itting, nearly touched the ceiling with his head; and &s;ugge&s;ted an idea, that if he were to ri&s;e up, he would de&s;troy the roof. A part of the pavement before it was of black marble, inclo&s;ed in a rim of Parian or white, where they poured oil to pre&s;erve the ivory.</P>
<P><HI>Pa&s;aunias</HI> declares, that a per&s;on may &s;ee many things wonderful to tell of, among the Greeks; but that the Olympic Agon, or games, with the Eleu&s;inian my&s;teries, partook in a &s;pecial manner of the deity. The former grand exhibition was conducted with pro|digious &s;olemnity.</P>
<P>From the &s;ilence of <HI>Homer,</HI> it has been argued, that the four great &s;pectacles of games in Greece, either did not exi&s;t when he wrote, or were in no repute. That of Olympia, however, deduced its origin from remote antiquity, and continued to a late period, un|dergoing &s;everal alterations.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXVII.</HI> The I&s;lands in Greece, forming part of, or adjoining to, the Cyclades.</HEAD>
<P>THE Grecian i&s;lands may be divided according to the &s;eas in which they lie; namely, in the Archipelago, the Mediterranean, and the parts about Candia and the Ionian &s;ea, as it was anciently called.</P>
<P>We &s;hall fir&s;t treat of the i&s;lands in the Archi|pelago, formerly called the Aegean &s;ea, but receiv|ing
<PB N="64" REF="65">
its pre&s;ent name from the Greek, <HI>Arkos</HI> chief, and <HI>Pelagos</HI> a &s;ea; it being the longe&s;t and principal &s;ea in tho&s;e parts. This &s;ea &s;eparates Europe from A&s;ia to the North and We&s;t, wa&s;hing Romania, Macedonia, and Greece; and to the Ea&s;t, Natolia and A&s;ia Minor. It is inter&s;per&s;ed with many large and &s;mall i&s;lands, com|prized by ancient geographers, under two general names. Tho&s;e which form a kind of circle round Delos, are called <HI>Cyclades. i. e.</HI> the circle i&s;lands; but tho&s;e which lie farther off from Delos, and are &s;cattered all over the Archipelago, they call <HI>Sporades, i. e.</HI> the &s;cattered i&s;lands.</P>
<P>Delos, the centre of the Cyclades, is &s;ituated in twenty-five degrees Ea&s;t longitude, and thirty-&s;even degrees North latitude, of an oblong figure, near twice as long as it is broad, and about &s;ix miles in circum|ference. It hath the South part of Mycone on the We&s;t; the channel between it and Tinos, on the North; and the i&s;land of Rhenia on the Ea&s;t. It is called little Delos, or Zdeli in the plural number, including the i&s;land of Rhenia. The rea&s;on of its being &s;o ce|lebrated by the ancients was, that this i&s;land was held to be the birth-place of <HI>Apollo</HI> and <HI>Diana.</HI> The i&s;lands, therefore, about it, &s;ent thither prie&s;ts, &s;acrifices, and choirs of virgins, in&s;tituting great and public fe&s;ti|vals to their two deities. The number of their &s;u|per&s;titious Cyclades was at fir&s;t but twelve, but after|wards
<PB N="65" REF="66">
comprehended mo&s;t of the i&s;lands in the Aegean &s;ea. Upon the de&s;truction of Corinth, the wealth and trade of that city, &s;eemed to be transferred hither, it being much frequented, from the &s;afety of its har|bours, and the convenience of its &s;ituation, being in the centre between Europe and A&s;ia; but more e&s;pe|cially on account of its immunities and freedom, from cu&s;toms and impo&s;itions. There are &s;till great heaps of ruins on this i&s;land, &s;ome of which belonged to the temple of <HI>Apollo,</HI> as appears by the trunk of his &s;tatue &s;till remaining. This god has been handled &s;o rudely, that they have left him neither hands, feet, nor head; but his locks hanging round his &s;houlders are &s;till to be &s;een, having marks in each curl, where apparently jewels had been &s;et; his girdle al&s;o appeared to have been richly adorned, and on his left &s;houlder was a light mantle. The &s;tatue was four times larger than life; the &s;houlders being &s;ix feet broad, and the re&s;t of the trunk proportionable. On the declivities of the hills are &s;ome very beautiful fragments of por|ticos and other ancient buildings.</P>
<P>The greater Delos, is &s;eparated from the le&s;&s;er, by a channel about five hundred paces in breadth, and is about eighteen miles in circumference. The moun|tains are not very high, and afford excellent pa&s;tu|rage: the vallies would produce corn and wine if they were cultivated, but this i&s;land, like the other Delos,
<PB N="66" REF="67">
is entirely de&s;erted; except, that the inhabitants of Mycone &s;end over &s;hepherds with large herds of cattle, which they are frequently obliged to tran&s;port back to their own i&s;land, to pre&s;erve them from the pirates that infe&s;t the&s;e &s;eas. <HI>Tournfort</HI> relates, that he &s;aw near one hundred and fifty altars among the ruins, which then made a very &s;tately appearance. They were mo&s;tly three feet and a half in height, and about three feet in diameter. The harbour of this i&s;land is called Port Ma&s;tick, from the great number of ma&s;|tick trees growing near it.</P>
<P>Mycone lies about three miles to the Ea&s;t of the Le&s;&s;er Delos, and is nearly thirty miles round. There is &s;carce a well in the country, and very little wood. The &s;oil produces corn, wine, and figs, and &s;ome few olives. They make five and twenty, or thirty thou|&s;and hog&s;heads of wine every year. The number of inhabitants in this i&s;land, are computed at three thou&s;and. Mo&s;t of the men follow a &s;eafaring life, and have the character of being pirates. The plun|der, at lea&s;t, is brought to this i&s;land by other pirates, who keep their wives and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es here. The wives of the &s;eamen, are for the mo&s;t part temporary ones; the women, in general here, being more in repute for their beauty than their cha&s;tity. A tra|veller relates, that the captain of a ve&s;&s;el he &s;ailed with, purcha&s;ed a young girl from her parents, who,
<FIGURE>
<PB REF="68">
<HEAD>PEOPLE of the ISLE of MYCONE with a GREEK-BOAT.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="67" REF="69">
with &s;eeming reluctance, &s;uffered her&s;elf to be carried on board, and was followed by a great number of young girls, from eleven to fifteen years of age, nearly a hundred, to the &s;ea-&s;ide, not to prevent the rape, but to give indications by the wantonne&s;s of their ge&s;tures, how much they wi&s;hed to have been carried off in like manner. The day following, the captain gave an entertainment to his officers, as if it had been his wedding, having dre&s;&s;ed the girl in a rich white Ve|netian habit. The dre&s;s of the women of Mycone, is very &s;ingular, and &s;carce reaches below their knees. The men wear large trow&s;ers gathered below the knee.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the inhabitants, are Chri&s;tians of the Greek church, and have magi&s;trates of their own; but an officer of the Turks comes annually to collect the tribute they are obliged to pay to the Porte. A cadi al&s;o frequently vi&s;its them, and holds a court in the i&s;land, that tho&s;e who may have any di&s;putes may bring their cau&s;es before him to decide; and the Greeks, it &s;eems, are frequently &s;o ridiculous as to come before this tribunal, in preference to &s;ubmitting their cau&s;es to be decided by their own magi&s;trates. There are no le&s;s than fifty Greek churches in this i&s;land, with &s;everal mona&s;teries and a nunnery. The convents of this i&s;land, however, are mo&s;tly de&s;erted,
<PB N="68" REF="70">
the people here not appearing very fond of a mona&s;|tic life.</P>
<P>The i&s;land of Naxia or Naxos, lies fifty miles to the South of Mycone, and eight miles Ea&s;t of Paros; it is of an oval form, and nearly an hundred miles in circumference. There is but one town which lies on the South-&s;ide of the i&s;land, and about forty villages, inhabited by Greek and Latin Chri&s;tians, of whom the former are mo&s;t numerous. The prejudices which the Greeks and Latin Chri&s;tians are &s;carce to be conceived; the Turks, however, make no di&s;tinc|tion between them. On the arrival of the &s;malle&s;t Turki&s;h galliot, the Chri&s;tians dare not appear with|out a red cloth upon their head, like the meane&s;t galley &s;lave: but, as &s;oon as the Turks are gone, the Naxian nobility re&s;ume their former pride and con|&s;equence, covered with their velvet caps, and di&s;cour&s;|ing of nothing but their families and pedigrees. The ladies are no le&s;s vain than the men, and are to be &s;een returning from the country after the vintage, with a train of thirty or forty females, &s;ome mounted on a&s;&s;es, and others on foot; one carrying a pair of &s;tockings, another a towel, a third a di&s;h; and there the ladies wardrobe and furniture is expo&s;ed to public view. She, her&s;elf, makes her entrance into the city at the head of this cavalcade, whil&s;t the hu&s;band brings up the rear. The Naxian nobility remain, for the

<P>Among their antiquities is &s;till &s;tanding a beautiful marble gate, in the mid&s;t of a heap of magnificent ruins, upon a rock in the &s;ea, at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the ca&s;tle.

<P>Antiparos, about a mile from Paros, is a flat rock, about &s;ixteen miles in circumference covered in &s;ome places with a &s;tratum of vegetable earth, which producs corn enough for about &s;ixty or eighty families, who inhabit a &s;mall village about a mile from the &s;ea; there is very little in this i&s;land de|&s;erving notice, except a very remarkable grotto, about forty fathoms in height, and fifty in breadth; the roof forms an arch embelli&s;hed with fret-work, and in &s;ome places there are bunches of grapes, fe&s;|toons, &amp;c. of a &s;urpri&s;ing length, or &s;omething re&s;embling; on the right and left are formed &s;everal little clo&s;ets or cabinets; and among other things there is a large pavilion, formed by productions, &s;o exactly repre&s;enting the roots, branches and heads of cauliflowers, as if nature intended to &s;hew how &s;he operates in the vegetation of &s;tone. All the&s;e figures are of white marble, tran&s;parent and cry&s;ta|lized, and many of them covered with a white back, which if &s;truck again&s;t, &s;ounds like copper. There are al&s;o &s;everal columns of marble, planted like trunks of trees, on the tuft of a little rock; the&s;e &s;tones of marble certainly vegetate, for not a &s;ingle drop of water ever falls into the place, and if it did,
<PB N="73" REF="75">
it is not conceivable how a few drops falling from a height of twenty-five or thirty fathoms, &s;hould form cylindrical pieces, terminating like round caps.</P>
<P>Adjoining to Paros, is Santorini, or St. Erini. It is eight miles in length, and as much in breadth, and almo&s;t covered with pumice-&s;tone, whence the &s;oil in general mu&s;t be dry and barren; it is however greatly improved by the indu&s;try of the inhabitants, who have turned it into a garden. It affords a great deal of barley, plenty of cotton, and large quantities of wine; in which, and their cotton manufactures, their trade con&s;i&s;ts. Fruit is &s;carce, except figs, and they have neither oil nor wood. They kill their beeves but once a year, and then they put the fle&s;h in pickle, which in time makes it very hard. The inhabitants are all Greeks, and about ten thou&s;and in number. Pyrgos is the capital town. They have but one &s;pring in the i&s;land, which obliges them to pre&s;erve the rain-water in ci&s;terns.</P>
<P>Acroteri, adjoining to the above, is an i&s;land much talked of in natural hi&s;tory. It appears to be only a pumice-&s;tone incru&s;ted with a fertile earth; and according to the accounts of the ancients, ro&s;e in a violent earthquake out of the &s;ea, as a volcano. The &s;ame origin had four other i&s;lands near Santorini, and the &s;ea here is of &s;uch a depth, as not to be fa|thomed
<PB N="74" REF="76">
by any &s;ounding-line. The fir&s;t of the&s;e i&s;lands ro&s;e out of the &s;ea, after a violent earthquake, in the year 906, before the birth of Chri&s;t; and in the beginning of the eighth century, a new i&s;land &s;uddenly appeared, with a terrible explo&s;ion, which &s;hook all the neighbouring i&s;lands, and adhered to the former i&s;land, which thereby became con&s;iderably enlarged: at the &s;ame time &s;howers of pumice-&s;tones were ca&s;t up to a va&s;t di&s;tance on all &s;ides. The &s;econd i&s;land, which lies a little without the harbour of Santorini, &s;prung from the &s;ea, in the fir&s;t cen|tury after the Chri&s;tian aera. In the year 1573, a &s;udden fire bur&s;t out of the &s;ea, and &s;oon produced a new i&s;land, to which was given the name of the '&s;mall Burnt i&s;land.' In the years 1707 and 1708, a fourth i&s;land ro&s;e like a volcano, attended with an eruption of fire, concu&s;&s;ions, a cra&s;h like the loude&s;t thunder, and a noi&s;ome &s;moke, and has been gra|dually increa&s;ed by additional rocks.</P>
<P>Cytheria, a &s;mall rocky i&s;land between Candia and the Morea, is remarkable for nothing, but hav|ing been attributed by the Poets to be the birth-place of <HI>Venus,</HI> and of <HI>Helen,</HI> who&s;e <HI>enl&eacute;vement</HI> by Paris, occa&s;ioned the &s;iege of Troy.</P>
<P>Melos, &s;ituated likewi&s;e in the Archipelago, be|tween Candia and the Morea, but more to the
<PB N="75" REF="77">
North, is of con&s;iderable extent, and &s;aid to contain about twenty thou&s;and inhabitants. This i&s;land is one hollow &s;pungy rock, which the &s;alt water enters by a great number of &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;ages; and, mixing with the &s;ulphur which abounds here, occa&s;ions almo&s;t continual fires. The hollow rock of Melos, is a kind of natural &s;tone, gently warming the &s;uper|fices of the earth in mo&s;t places, and thereby cau&s;ing it to produce the choice&s;t fruits, particularly grapes, figs, and melons, the be&s;t in the Archipelago; &s;o fer|tile is the &s;oil, that it never lies fallow; one year it produces wheat, another barley; a third, pea&s;e and beans, melons, &amp;c. Their fields are like &s;o many gardens, &s;eparated from each other by &s;tone walls. For eatables, be&s;ides butcher's meat, they have fowl, fi&s;h, and game in great plenty. Though they live in a &s;ickly unwhole&s;ome air, and upon the &s;urface of a burning lake, as it were, which they may expect every day &s;hould break out and de&s;troy them, and their country; they are as merry as Greeks, u&s;ed formerly to be, and indulge in the good things they thus abun|dantly po&s;&s;e&s;s; neither the &s;ickne&s;s, the Turki&s;h tyranny, nor burning caverns in the bowels of the i&s;land, can dige&s;t the &s;pirits of the merry Meliotes. The inhabitants of Melos are generally &s;eafaring men, and &s;erve as pilots to &s;hips which &s;ail in the Archi|pelago. The cha&s;tity of their women is equal to that of the ladies of &s;ome other &s;ea-ports. <HI>Tournfort</HI>
<PB N="76" REF="78">
&s;ays, they are arrant coquets, and u&s;e the powder of a &s;ea-plant to give a ruddine&s;s to their complexion; but it &s;oon de&s;troys their &s;kin and &s;poils their beauty. They wear drawers like the re&s;ts of the females in the Levant, which &s;eem a very nece&s;&s;ary part of their dre&s;s, their petticoats &s;carce reaching to their knees.</P>
<P>There are two Turki&s;h magi&s;trates in the i&s;land, the Cadi, and the Waivode; the one a civil, and the other a military officer; but their principal employ &s;eems to be, to take care that the Sultan is not de|frauded of his duties, and to extort as much as they can from the poor Greeks, to fill their own pockets. The Greeks have here, as in the other i&s;lands, the pri|vilege of electing their own magi&s;trates, who decide all controver&s;ies among them, though &s;ometimes they are &s;o indi&s;creet as to appeal to the Cadi, and make an infidel their judge.</P>
<P>The modern name of this i&s;land, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> is Milo or Mile. Anciently it had a town of the &s;ame name built by the Phenicians. That maritime people, attracted by the beauty of the port, undoubtedly made it an emporium of their commerce. In early anti|quity, this i&s;land enjoyed perfect freedom. The Athe|nians, unable to bring the people of Melos to declare in their favour in the Peloponne&s;ian war, made a de|&s;cent upon their coa&s;ts, and laid all wa&s;te before them
<PB N="77" REF="79">
with fire and &s;word. Twice did they fail in their en|terprize, but returning with more numerous forces, they laid &s;iege to Melos, and having reduced the be|&s;ieged to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion, according to <HI>Strabo,</HI> put to the &s;word every man capable of bearing arms. They &s;pared only the women and children, whom they carried into captivity. This atrocious action makes us blu&s;h for humanity, and di&s;honours the Athenian name. But war was then carried on with a barbarity of which we have now no example. Re|publics know not how to pardon, and always carry their vengeance to exce&s;s. <HI>Ly&s;ander,</HI> the Lacedae|monian general, having in his turn &s;ubdued the Athe|nians, obliged them to recal the colony they had &s;ent to Melos, and re&s;tored to the i&s;land the wretched re|mains of its inhabitants.</P>
<P>The i&s;land lo&s;t its liberty, when the Romans a&s;pir|ing to the empire of the world, conquered the whole Archipelago. In the partition of that monarchy it fell to the Ea&s;tern emperors; was afterwards govern|ed by its own dukes, and finally was conquered by <HI>Solyman</HI> II. Since that period, it has groaned be|neath Ottoman de&s;poti&s;m, and is completely deprived of its importance.</P>
<P><HI>Tournfort,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> who vi&s;ited this, i&s;land in 1700, gives a delightful de&s;cription of it. The earth,
<PB N="78" REF="80">
con&s;tantly heated by &s;ubterraneous fires, produces, almo&s;t without intermi&s;&s;ion, wheat, barley, cotton, exqui&s;ite wines, and delicious melons. S. Elic, the mo&s;t beautiful mona&s;tery in the i&s;land, and &s;ituated on the highe&s;t ground, is &s;urrounded by cedars, and orange, lemon, and fig-trees. The gardens are water|ed by copious &s;treams. Olive-trees, which are rare in other parts, are very numerous round this mona&s;|tery, and the adjoining vineyards, furni&s;h excellent wine. In a word, all the productions of the i&s;land are of incomparable excellence. Its partridges, quails, kids, and lambs, are in high e&s;timation, yet extremely cheap.</P>
<P>Could <HI>Tournfort,</HI> adds <HI>Savary,</HI> return to Milo, he would no longer find the beauteous i&s;le he has de&s;crib|ed. He would &s;till &s;ee the feathered alum with &s;ilver threads, &s;u&s;pended from the roofs of caverns, frag|ments of pure &s;ulphur filling the crevices of the rocks; numerous mineral &s;prings, hot baths, and the &s;ame fires which in his time heated the bo&s;om of the earth, and rendered it &s;o fertile. But, in&s;tead of the many thou&s;and Greeks paying the capitation, he would now find, on a &s;urface of eighteen leagues in circum|ference, only about &s;even hundred inhabitants. He would &s;igh to behold the fine&s;t parts of the country without cultivation, and fertile vallies changed into mora&s;&s;es. Milo has a&s;&s;umed a very different appear|ance
<PB N="79" REF="81">
within the cour&s;e of the la&s;t fifty years. The plague every where propagated by the Turks, has cut off the greate&s;t part of its inhabitants; and the dete&s;ta|ble government of the Porte, and the oppre&s;&s;ions of the Captain Pacha, have completed its de&s;truction. At pre&s;ent, the want of labourers prevents their giving a free cour&s;e to the water; which, &s;tagnating in the valleys, turns fetid, and infects the air with putrid ex|halations. The &s;alt mar&s;hes, which have multiplied for want of care, have produced the &s;ame effect. If to their inconveniencies the &s;ulphureous vapours, which ari&s;e on every &s;ide, are added, it will not be &s;urpri&s;ing, that the inhabitants of Mile are tormented with violent fevers during three quarters of the year. Nay, po&s;&s;ibly, they will be under the nece&s;&s;ity of totally abandoning their country. Their complexions are univer&s;ally of a yellow, pale, and deadly hue; nor is the look of health to be found in any one of them. The prudent traveller &s;hould take care to make but a &s;hort &s;tay in this unhealthy country, if he would not expo&s;e him&s;elf to a fever. Only to &s;leep a &s;ingle night in the i&s;land, nay, even to pa&s;s a day there, is &s;ometimes &s;ufficient to contract that di|&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>An enlightened government, &s;ays the above author, might remove the&s;e calamities which have &s;o depo|pulated Melos. Its fir&s;t care ought to be, to e&s;ta|bli&s;h
<PB N="80" REF="82">
a Lazaretto, and prevent the approach of in|fected ve&s;&s;els. Canals &s;hould then be cut to drain the mar&s;hes, from which ari&s;e pe&s;tiferous exhalations. The i&s;land would re-people, for the &s;ulphureous va|pours are not what mo&s;t render it de&s;olate; it pro|duced them equally in the time of the ancients, yet it was extremely populous. To the de&s;cription, therefore, of the Turki&s;h government, and its dete&s;ta|ble politics, mu&s;t we attribute the de&s;truction of the i&s;land of Melos. Let me not be accu&s;ed, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> of painting the Turks in colours blacker than they de&s;erve. I have travelled through their empire, I have &s;een the injuries of every kind which they have done to the &s;ciences, the arts, and the human race; I &s;ee them carrying the plague, from i&s;land to i&s;land, from country to country, without &s;uffering their eyes to be opened by the example of every other nation; and &s;hall I not rai&s;e my voice again&s;t the abominable indifference of this barbarous people! Shall I not inveigh again&s;t their de&s;tructive fatali&s;m, and endea|vour to find words &s;ufficiently forcible to paint the crimes and horrors of their government; the enemy of the human &s;pecies, which has de&s;troyed more men by its odious tyranny, than ever fell by the &s;word of the mo&s;t cruel conqueror! At the &s;ight of the&s;e me|lancholy &s;pectacles, my heart groans, and is filled with indignation; my blood boils in my veins, and I could wi&s;h to excite all Europe to combine again&s;t the&s;e

Turks, who, de&s;cending from the mountains of Arme|nia, have cru&s;hed the nations in their pa&s;&s;age, and waded through rivers of blood to the throne of Con|&s;tantinople. Nor have the beautiful countries they inhabit, been able to &s;often the ferocity of their cha|racter. Power is their law, and ju&s;tice their &s;abre.</P>
<P>Adjoining to Melos, is the little i&s;land of Argen|tiera, formerly famous for its &s;ilver mines. The &s;oil is extremely dry, and de&s;titute of &s;prings; nor is there any water but what is collected in ci&s;terns, or brought from Melos; the hills, vales, and the whole country &s;tript of trees, do not offer a &s;ingle &s;hade from the &s;un. The Venetians, during their war with the Turks, cut down all the olive-trees, and did irreparable da|mage to the i&s;land; nor do the pre&s;ent inhabitants dare to make fre&s;h plantations, le&s;t they &s;hould draw on them&s;elves heavier impo&s;itions.</P>
<P>Argentiera pre&s;ents nothing but rocky hills, de&s;ti|tute of verdure, and vallies producing worthle&s;s &s;hrubs, and thorny thickets. The vales are generally cover|ed with a white and fat clay, called by the ancients <HI>Terra Cimolia,</HI> (Fuller's earth,) and which the inha|bitants employ in&s;tead of &s;oap, to wa&s;h their linen. This barren &s;oil &s;eems but ill adapted to agriculture; yet the indu&s;trious i&s;landers make it produce them a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. They &s;ow barley and wheat in the be|ginning
<PB N="82" REF="84">
of autumn, which is the rainy &s;ea&s;on, and reap in March. Their vineyards on the hill-&s;ides, fur|ni&s;h them with fruit only for the table. They pro|cure their wines from Santorini, Milo, and other i&s;lands of the Archipelago. They rear poultry and flocks of goats and &s;heep, the fle&s;h of which is ex|cellent. The country affords them quails, hares, and partridges in abundance. The women knit cotton &s;tockings, and the men employ them&s;elves in fi&s;hing and navigation. Excellent fi&s;h are taken round the i&s;land, e&s;pecially the <HI>Roujet,</HI> which is very delicate eating.</P>
<P>The little tribe which inhabits Argentiera, is com|po&s;ed of about five hundred per&s;ons. Their enjoy|ments are not many, but thanks to their indu&s;try, they want none of the nece&s;&s;aries of life. This little i&s;land does not groan under the immediate oppre&s;&s;ions of the officers of the Porte; here are no Agas nor Cadis. The Turks would not venture to re&s;ide here, as there is no fort to prevent the Malte&s;e from mak|ing them pri&s;oners, who&s;e privateers come hither, from time to time, to &s;pend in fea&s;ts, entertainments, and plea&s;ures of every kind, the money they have taken from the Mahometans. This is a tribute they pay to the pretty women of Argentiera. In a word, the Greeks who inhabit this rock would be happy, were the Captain Pacha but to forget them in the
<PB N="83" REF="85">
annual contributions he levies, frequently with bar|barity, on the i&s;lands of the Archipelago.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of the Greek women of Argentiera, is, in &s;ome particulars, a little whim&s;ical. In France and England, a neat leg and &s;mall foot are in high e&s;tima|tion, but the <HI>belles</HI> of Argentiera are of a different opinion; they &s;well out their legs by wearing &s;everal pair of &s;tockings, and appear as if they were booted, which &s;trange kind of ornament they con&s;ider as an e&s;&s;ential part of dre&s;s; and le&s;t it &s;hould be lo&s;t to the eye their garments do not de&s;cend above two inches below the knee. The&s;e too are &s;o contrived, as ab&s;olutely to &s;poil their &s;hape, and render it im|po&s;&s;ible to form any idea of the beautiful proportions with which they were formed by nature. In other re&s;pects they are cheerful, lively, and hand&s;ome. If it be repre&s;ented to them, that they di&s;gui&s;e by &s;uch prepo&s;terous ornaments, &s;ome of the lovelie&s;t of their charms, their an&s;wer is, "Our grandmother did &s;o before us; and we do but follow their cu&s;tom."</P>
<P>Thermia lies to the North-ea&s;t of Melos; it re|ceives its name from the hot-baths which are in the i&s;land. This i&s;land is not &s;o mountainous as many others, and the &s;oil being well cultivated, yields plenty of barley, wine, and figs; but wheat and oil are very &s;carce. It is computed there are about &s;ix thou&s;and
<PB N="84" REF="86">
inhabitants in the i&s;land; they have a Greek bi&s;hop re&s;iding in the city of Thermia, the capital, in which there are fifteen or &s;ixteen churches, and &s;everal con|vents. There are a number of hot &s;prings in this i&s;land; the ancient baths were &s;ituated in the centre of a valley, the fragments of which are &s;till remaining. On the i&s;land are &s;till vi&s;ible, the ruins of two cities; one of which on the South coa&s;t, mu&s;t have been of extraordinary &s;plendor.</P>
<P>A few miles to the We&s;t of Thermia, lies Zia or Ceos. In this i&s;land are many remains of antiquity. It is about fifty miles round. Carthea is now the only city remaining; it is &s;ituated on the &s;ide of a hill, and the flat roofed hou&s;es, ri&s;ing gradually, form a kind of theatre; the roofs of the hou&s;es are the only &s;treets there are to walk in. The valley near the town, contains innumerable pieces of broken columns, or pede&s;tals. The fir&s;t will admit the large&s;t ve&s;&s;els. The ruins of the city of Ioulis, occupy an entire mountain. An ancient temple is &s;till to be &s;een; the columns of which, have their &s;hafts half plain and half fluted. From this temple, there is a de&s;cent from the &s;ea-&s;hore, by a noble marble &s;tair-ca&s;e; at the foot, is the &s;tatue of a woman without arms or head, but the drapery exqui&s;itely fine; it is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the godde&s;s of Neme&s;is. In this i&s;land likewi&s;e, are the remains of a road paved with flat &s;tones, ex|tending
<PB N="85" REF="87">
three miles in length, and &s;uppo&s;ed to have been made, when Greece was in its flouri&s;hing &s;tate. It is &s;aid, that this country having formerly been very populous, a law was enacted, if any per&s;on lived above &s;ixty years, that it &s;hould be lawful to poi&s;on him, or put him to death by any other means. And it is &s;aid, the natives had &s;uch an indifference for life, that they very chearfully re&s;igned it.</P>
<P>Syra is another &s;mall i&s;land to the Ea&s;t of Zia. The principal city is built round the &s;ides of a little &s;teep hill in the form of a pyramid, at the di&s;tance of a mile from the port, where &s;tood the ancient Syros. In this i&s;land, the Romi&s;h clergy boa&s;t of a great &s;upe|riority in numbers, over tho&s;e of the Greek commu|nion. The people of this i&s;land are al&s;o &s;aid to be of a character very different from that of their neigh|bours; being per&s;ons of &s;trict piety and hone&s;ty, as well as diligence, and improving their manufactures to the utmo&s;t.</P>
<P>Andros lies fifty miles North-ea&s;t of Zia, and is in circumference about an hundred miles; its length, however, is much greater than the breadth. The principal town is &s;ituated near the &s;ea, and called the port of the lower ca&s;tle; its ancient monuments &s;hew it was built on the ruins of &s;ome magnificent city; though nothing can be more de&s;picable than the pre|&s;ent
<PB N="86" REF="88">
buildings, con&s;idering the materials of which they are con&s;tructed. The dre&s;s of the women of this i&s;land, like that of the other i&s;lands, is not very be|coming; their petticoats &s;carce reaching to their knees, and their &s;hifts coming down &s;till lower; they generally wrap them&s;elves up in five or &s;ix gowns, and wear large rolls of cloth about their wai&s;ts like far|thingales. The &s;leeves of their gowns are &s;o very ample, that they reach almo&s;t to the ground: on their legs they wear white cloth &s;tockings, with &s;lippers in|&s;tead of &s;hoes for their feet: a piece of linen is wrap|ped round their heads, which likewi&s;e covers their brea&s;ts. The u&s;ual garb of the men, is a ve&s;t and a red cap; and in&s;tead of &s;hoes, they wear pumps, or &s;lippers, a cu&s;tom very prevalent in the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>This is one of the mo&s;t fertile i&s;lands in the Archi|pelago, yielding great plenty of wine, oil, and barley, with &s;ome wheat; but their principal riches con&s;i&s;t in &s;ilk. Their mountains are covered with the arbu|tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">-trees, from which they di&s;til a &s;pirit, as they do from their mulberries.</P>
<P>On the ruins of the ancient Paleopolis, &s;ituated on the brow of a hill near the &s;ea, are &s;een the fragments of a &s;olid wall, with columns, chapitres, ba&s;es, and in&s;criptions, mentioning the &s;enate and people of Andros, and the prie&s;ts of <HI>Bacchus.</HI> The trunks of
<PB N="87" REF="89">
&s;everal &s;tatues likewi&s;e be&s;peak the hand of &s;ome ma&s;terly engraver; but the different members have been mutilated by the Turks, who have an utter aver|&s;ion to images. Near the temple of <HI>Bacchus</HI> was a fountain; which, according to tradition, on certain days, every year flowed with wine in&s;tead of water.</P>
<P>Tine, or Tinos, lies about a mile to the South-ea&s;t of Andros. This i&s;land is about &s;ixty miles in circum|ference; it is well watered, and produces great quan|tities of corn, wine, and fruit; and particularly &s;ilk, of which the inhabitants make &s;tockings and gloves. They dre&s;s here in a more decent &s;tile than that of the other i&s;lands, following the Venetian fa&s;hions: this i&s;land having been longer under the dominion of the Venetians than any other in the Archipelago. From the ca&s;tle, is a noble pro&s;pect of the adjacent i&s;les.</P>

<P>HAVING now taken a cur&s;ory view of tho&s;e i&s;lands, which either make part, or are adjoin|ing to the Cyclades, we propo&s;e to treat of the other
<PB N="88" REF="90">
i&s;lands in the Archipelago; mo&s;t of which, either lie near, or are con&s;idered, by many geographers, as be|longing to the A&s;iatic coa&s;t, Negropont, and one or two others excepted.</P>
<P>Stalimene, anciently Lemnos, is an i&s;land in the North part of the Archipelago, of a quadrangular figure, each &s;ide being from five and twenty, to thirty miles in length; and is equally di&s;tant from the coa&s;ts of Romania, Natolia, and Macedonia. The prin|cipal &s;ource of wealth in this i&s;land, is a mineral earth, called <HI>Terra Lemnia,</HI> which is &s;aid to be an excellent medicine for healing wounds, expelling poi&s;ons, &s;top|ping dy&s;enteries, &amp;c. and a great pre&s;ervative again&s;t infection. It is made up in little bags, and &s;ealed by the Turki&s;h officers; after which, it is permitted to be vended and exported.</P>
<P>The Greeks begin to collect it on the 6th of Augu&s;t. with much &s;uper&s;titious ceremony. There is only one hill which produces it; the &s;urface of the ground being dug up, they ea&s;ily find the vein, re&s;embling earth ca&s;t up by worms; after as much being taken up as the prie&s;ts approve and put into bags, the ground is covered over as before, and &s;ome bags of this earth are &s;ent as pre&s;ents to the Grand Signior, and the re&s;t &s;old to the foreign merchants by the Sanjiac, or his deputies. The inhabitants
<PB N="89" REF="91">
keeping this earth in their hou&s;es without his per|mi&s;&s;ion, are puni&s;hed with death.</P>
<P>When the Venetians po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed this i&s;land, there were between forty and fifty towns and villages upon it, and the i&s;land was well inhabited, but at pre&s;ent it is very thinly peopled. It was upon this i&s;land that the poets feign <HI>Vulcan</HI> to have fallen, when kicked out of Paradi&s;e by <HI>Juno,</HI> for his deformity; and that being lamed in his fall, he was called <HI>Lemnius,</HI> and wor&s;hipped by the people of the i&s;land as a decrepid deity.</P>
<P>The i&s;land Tenedos, which lies between Lemnos and the continent of A&s;ia, is chiefly rock, but fertile. It was anciently reckoned about ten miles in circum|ference. Its po&s;ition near the mouth of the Helle|pont, has given it importance in all ages; ve&s;&s;els bound towards Con&s;tantinople finding &s;helter in its port, or &s;afe anchorage in the road, during the Ete&s;ian winds, and in foul weather. The emperor <HI>Ju&s;tinian,</HI> erected a magazine, to receive the cargoes of the corn-&s;hips from Alexandria, when detained there. This building was two hundred and eighty feet long, ninety broad, and very lofty. The voyage from Egypt was rendered le&s;s precarious, and the grain pre&s;erved, until it could be tran&s;ported to the ca|pital. Afterwards, during the troubles of the Greek
<PB N="90" REF="92">
empire, Tenedos experienced a variety of fortunes. The pirates, which infe&s;ted the&s;e &s;eas, made it for many years their place of rendezvous; and <HI>Othman</HI> &s;eized it in 1302, procured ve&s;&s;els, and from thence &s;ubdued the other i&s;lands of the Archipelago.</P>
<P>The port of Tenedos has been inclo&s;ed in a mole, of which no part appears above water, but loo&s;e &s;tones are piled on the foundations to break the waves. The ba&s;on is encompa&s;&s;ed by a ridge of the moun|tain. On the South-&s;ide is a row of wind-mills, and a &s;mall fort; and on the oppo&s;ite, a ca&s;tle by the &s;hore. The hou&s;es, which are numerous, &s;tand at the foot, or on the &s;lope of an acclivity; with a flat between them and the &s;ea, formed partly by &s;oil wa&s;hed down from above. They reckon &s;ix hundred Turki&s;h, and three hundred Greek families. The church belong|ing to the latter, is decent.</P>
<P>We found here but few remains of antiquity, &s;ays <HI>Chandler,</HI> worthy notice. We perceived on our land|ing, a large and entire Sarcophagus, or &s;tone coffin, &s;erving as a fountain; the top &s;tone, or lid, being per|forated to admit a current of water, which &s;upplies the vent below; and on one &s;ide is an in&s;cription. Near this was part of a fluted column, converted into a mortar for brui&s;ing corn; and in a &s;hop was a remnant of te&s;&s;ellated pavement then recently di&s;co|vered.
<PB N="91" REF="93">
In the &s;treets, the walls and burying grounds, were pieces of marble, and fragments of pillars, with a few in&s;criptions.</P>
<P>In the evening, this being Sunday, and a fe&s;tival, we were much amu&s;ed with &s;eeing the Greeks, who were &s;inging and dancing, in &s;everal companies, to mu&s;ic, near the town; while their women were &s;itting in groups, on the roofs of the hou&s;es, which are flat, as &s;pectators; at the &s;ame time enjoying the &s;oft air and &s;erene &s;ky.</P>
<P>We were lodged much to our &s;atisfaction in a large room, with a rai&s;ed floor matted, in which we &s;lept in our clothes, in company with two Jews and &s;everal Greeks; a cool breeze entering all night at the latticed windows, and &s;weetening our repo&s;e.</P>
<P>In the&s;e countries, on account of the heat, it is u&s;ual to ri&s;e with the dawn. About day-break, we received from the French con&s;ul, a Greek, with a re&s;pectable beard, a pre&s;ent of grapes, the clu&s;ters large and rich, with other fruits, all fre&s;h gathered. We had be&s;ides, bread and coffee for breakfa&s;t, and good wines, particularly one &s;ort, of an exqui&s;ite flavour, called Mu&s;cadell. The i&s;land is de&s;ervedly famous for the &s;pecies of wine which produces this delicious liquor.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="94">Mitylene, anciently Le&s;bos, &s;ituated a few leagues from Elca, in Le&s;&s;er A&s;ia, is of con&s;iderable extent, and though &s;ome part is mountainous and barren, it has many fruitful plains, which produce plenty of corn. The chief town is Ca&s;tro, anciently Mity|lene, having a &s;trong garri&s;on to protect the i&s;land again&s;t the pyrates, which infe&s;t very much the&s;e &s;eas. In this i&s;land are &s;aid to be upwards of a hundred villages. It has given birth to, and been the re&s;idence of, &s;ome of the greate&s;t men of antiquity. <HI>Theophra&s;tus,</HI> and <HI>Phanios,</HI> di&s;ciples of <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> were natives of this i&s;land. The famous <HI>Arion,</HI> al&s;o was born here; who&s;e &s;kill in mu&s;ic charmed the Dol|phins, &s;o that they carried him &s;afe to the &s;hore. <HI>Epicurus</HI> read lectures at Mitylene, and <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> re|&s;ided there for many years. Though few i&s;lands indeed have produced men of greater genius, yet all their grave lectures it &s;eems could not reform their morals; it being a proverb in Greece, when &s;peak|ing of a profligate fellow, to &s;ay, <HI>he lived like a Le&s;bian.</HI></P>
<P>In this i&s;land there &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts two very &s;ingular in&s;titutions. The fir&s;t is, that all e&s;tates, both real and per&s;onal, de&s;cend to the elde&s;t daughters; whereby all the males, and the younger children of the female line are di&s;inherited. This cu&s;tom is of very ancient date, and is &s;aid to have been con&s;ented
<PB N="93" REF="95">
to by the males, out of love to their &s;i&s;ters, and to procure better e&s;tabli&s;hments for them. The Myty|lenians, &s;ays <HI>Guys,</HI> informed me, that the men would have no difficulty in getting their right of inheritance re&s;tored, if they cho&s;e to claim the benefit of the Turki&s;h law, which admits the children of both &s;exes to an equal &s;hare in the parents fortune. But the man, who &s;hould attempt to promote his intere&s;t by an appeal to a foreign power, would for ever ap|pear infamous in the eyes of his countrymen.</P>
<P>The other is, that in a &s;mall town, about three days journey from the capital, every &s;tranger, upon his arrival, is compelled to marry one of the women; even though his &s;tay &s;hould be for a night only. They generally pre&s;ent a maiden to him, whom he mu&s;t ab&s;olutely e&s;pou&s;e. Or, if he &s;hould prove to be a man of great property or importance, &s;everal females are pre&s;ented, and he has the &s;election of one of them. Travellers of inferior rank have no choice, but mu&s;t accept the lady offered to them; who, in that ca&s;e, is generally the olde&s;t and plaine&s;t in the di&s;trict. A prie&s;t then appears, who performs the marriage ceremonies with great &s;olemnity; a nuptial fea&s;t is prepared; and the new married couple pa&s;s the night together. The hu&s;band may, if he plea&s;es, depart the next morning. If he has any money, or valuable effects, and chu&s;es to make his
<PB N="94" REF="96">
ephemeral wife a pre&s;ent, it is received, and indeed expected. But if he &s;hould not, he may &s;till pro|proceed upon his journey without mole&s;tation. The lady thinks her&s;elf &s;ufficiently obliged to him, for having delivered her from the reproach of virginity; which it is ignominious either to retain, or even to &s;urrender to a Mitylenian. The pre&s;ervation of the lady's honour depends upon her being fir&s;t married to a &s;tranger. It is of no con&s;equence whether he re|mains with her, or ever returns. At the expiration of a year, &s;he may contract a new marriage with any man that pre&s;ents him&s;elf; and &s;hould the for|mer hu&s;band appear, he would have no legal claim whatever upon account of his previous marriage. The fir&s;t is, that a woman cannot marry to advantage, until &s;he has had intercour&s;e with a &s;tranger. This cu&s;tom is &s;aid to be of mo&s;t ancient date, and the only alteration the teachers of the Chri&s;tian religion have been able to effect is, that the cohabitation &s;hall be preceded by a marriage according to the forms of the church now e&s;tabli&s;hed there. By this compro|mi&s;e, the prie&s;t, the bride, and all parties quiet the &s;cruples of their con&s;cience.</P>
<P>The i&s;land Chios, now Scio, is by <HI>Strabo</HI> reckoned one hundred and twelve miles and an half in cir|cuit; and about fifty miles from the i&s;land Mitylene. The principal mountain, called anciently Pelinaeus,
<PB N="95" REF="97">
pre&s;ents to view a long lofty range of bare rocks, re|flecting the &s;un; but the rece&s;&s;es at its feet, are dili|gently cultivated, and reward the hu&s;bandman by their rich produce. The &s;lopes are clothed with rich vines. The groves of lemon, orange, and citron trees, regularly planted, at once perfume the air with the odour of their blo&s;&s;oms, and delight the eye with their golden fruit. Myrtles and je&s;&s;amines are inter&s;per&s;ed, with olive and palm-trees, and cypre&s;&s;es. Amid the&s;e, the tall minarets ri&s;e, and white hou&s;es glitter, dazzling the beholder.</P>
<P>Scio &s;hared in the calamities which attended the de&s;truction of the Greek empire. In the year 1093, when robbers and pirates were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;everal con&s;iderable places; <HI>Trachas,</HI> a Turki&s;h malecontent, took the city. In 1306, this was one of the i&s;lands which &s;uffered from the exactions of the Grand Duke <HI>Roger,</HI> general of the Roman armies. The city was then &s;eized by the Turks, who came before it with thirty &s;hips, and put the inhabitants to the &s;word. In 1346, the Genoe&s;e took the city, and kept in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Scio about 240 years. They were de|prived of it by the Turks, in 1566, but the Chiotes in general, were &s;till indulged with numerous and ex|traordinary privileges. They con&s;i&s;ted of two par|ties, differing in their religious tenets; one of the Greek per&s;ua&s;ion, which acknowledges the patriarch
<PB N="96" REF="98">
of Con&s;tantinople as their head; the other of the Latin or papi&s;ts, which enjoyed a free toleration under the Turks, their prie&s;ts celebrating ma&s;s as in Chri&s;tendom, bearing the &s;acrament to the &s;ick, going in &s;olemn proce&s;&s;ion, habited, beneath ca|nopies, with cen&s;ors in their hands, to the year 1694. The Venetians then attacked and took the ca&s;tle, but afterwards abandoned it on a defeat of their fleets. The Latins, who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted them, dreading the puni&s;hment which their ingratitude de|&s;erved, fled, with their families and the bi&s;hop, and &s;ettled in the Morea. The Turks &s;eized the churches, aboli&s;hed the Genoe&s;e dre&s;s, and impo&s;ed on their va&s;&s;als badges of their &s;ubjection; obliging them, among other articles, to alight from their hor&s;es at the city gates, and at the approach of any, even the meane&s;t, Mu&s;&s;ulman.</P>
<P>The town of Scio and its vicinity, re&s;embles from the &s;ea, Genoa and its territory, as it were in mi|niature. The ancient city had a good port, and &s;ta|tions for eighty &s;hips. The pre&s;ent, which occupies its &s;ite beneath Pelinaeus, is large, well-built, and po|pulous. A naked hill ri&s;es above it, with a hou&s;e or two on the &s;ummit, where was the Acropolis of the Greeks, and afterwards the citadel of the Genoe&s;e. The port has an ordinary or ruinous mole, like that of Tenedos, almo&s;t level with the water. The town,

<PB N="97" REF="100">
&s;ays <HI>Chandler,</HI> appeared to us a collection of petty palaces, after the hovels of mud we had &s;een on the continent of A&s;ia.</P>
<P>The beautiful Greek girls are the mo&s;t &s;triking ornaments of Scio. Many of the&s;e were &s;itting at the doors and windows, twi&s;ting cotton or &s;ilk, or employed in &s;pinning, or needle-work, and acco&s;ted us with familiarity, bidding us welcome as we pa&s;&s;ed. The &s;treets on Sundays and holidays are filled with them in groups. They wear &s;hort petticoats, reach|ing only to their knees, with white &s;ilk or cotton ho&s;e. Their head-dre&s;s, which is peculiar to the i&s;land, is a kind of turban, the linen &s;o white and thin, it &s;eemed to be &s;now. Their &s;lippers are chiefly yellow, with a knot of red fringe at the heel. Some wore them fa&s;tened with a thong. Their gar|ments were of various colours; and their whole ap|pearance &s;o fanta&s;tic and lively, as to afford us much entertainment. [See the plate, which exhibits the dre&s;s of the females of Scio, Naxos, and Mity|lene.] The Turks inhabit a &s;eparate quarter, and their women are concealed.</P>
<P>We returned to the &s;hip at night, &s;ays <HI>Chandler,</HI> the Dragoman and Chiote lighting us with long paper lanthorns, to the boat, which waited at the beach. A great number of ghaunt dogs were collected by
<PB N="98" REF="101">
the &s;hambles, which are at the out&s;kirts of the town. They barked furiou&s;ly at us, but were chid and re|pelled by our guides, who&s;e language they under|&s;tood. The public, we are told, maintains them; and they a&s;&s;emble when all is quiet. It is ob&s;ervable, that the&s;e animals were of old a like nui&s;ance, being the Lemures of the ancients, who u&s;ed to pacify them with food. The Arcadians in particular were accu&s;tomed to carry bread from their table, on ac|count of the nightly terrors, or the dogs, which they expected to a&s;&s;ail them in the &s;treets.</P>
<P>Pro&s;perity is le&s;s friendly to antiquity, than de&s;er|tion and depopulation. We &s;aw here no &s;tadium, theatre, or odeum; but &s;o illu&s;trious a city, with a marble quarry near it, could not be de&s;titute of tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ary &s;tructures, and perhaps &s;ome traces might be di&s;covered about the hills of the Acropolis. A few bas-reliefs and marble, are fixed in the walls, and over the gate-ways of the hou&s;es. We found by the &s;ea-&s;ide, near the town, three &s;tones with in|&s;criptions, which had been brought for balla&s;t, from the continent of A&s;ia. The Chiote, our attendant, was vociferous in his enquiries, to little purpo&s;e. We were more than once de&s;ired to look at a Ge|noe&s;e coat of arms for a piece of ancient &s;culpture, and a date in modern Greek for an old in&s;cription.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="102">The mo&s;t curious remain is, that which without rea&s;on has been named, <HI>The School of Homer.</HI> It is on the coa&s;t, at &s;ome di&s;tance from the city, north|ward, and appears to have been an open temple of <HI>Cybele,</HI> formed on the top of a rock. The &s;hape is oval, and in the centre is the image of the godde&s;s, the head and an arm wanting. She is repre&s;ented as u&s;ual, &s;itting. The chair has a lion carved on each &s;ide, and on the back. The area is bounded by a low ruin or &s;eat, and about five yards over. The whole is hewn out of the mountain, is rude, and in|di&s;tinct; and probably of the mo&s;t remote antiquity.</P>
<P>The wines of Scio have been celebrated as aiding dige&s;tion, as nutritious and plea&s;ant. They were much e&s;teemed by the Romans. <HI>Horten&s;ius</HI> hoarded them; and <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> who was as generous as magni|ficent, di&s;pen&s;ed them freely to the people at his triumphs and &s;acrifices. It is related, that the cul|ture of the vine was introduced by a &s;on of <HI>Bacchus,</HI> called <HI>Oenopion,</HI> or, <HI>The Wine-drinker,</HI> who&s;e &s;epulchre remained here in the &s;econd century; and that red wine, with the making of the&s;e liquors, was invented by the Chians. A rugged tract named Arvi&s;ia, was particularly famous for its produce, which has been extolled as ambro&s;ial, and &s;tiled a new nectar. We were treated with a variety of choice &s;pecimens,
<PB N="100" REF="103">
and it may be que&s;tioned if either the flavour, or qualities once &s;o commended, be at all impaired.</P>
<P>To the peculiar po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Arvi&s;ian wine, no longer talked of, has &s;ucceeded the profitable cul|ture of the Lenti&s;cus, or ma&s;tic tree. This em|ploys, as we were told, twenty-one villages; which are required to provide as many thou&s;and okes of gum annually, for the u&s;e of the &s;eraglio, at Con|&s;tantinople. They procure it by boring the trunk with a &s;mall &s;harp iron, in the &s;ummer-months. In October their harve&s;t is conveyed with mu&s;ic into the city, and lodged in the ca&s;tle. The cadi, and officers who attend while it is weighed, have each a certain portion for their perqui&s;ite. The remainder is delivered to the farmer, or planter, to be di&s;po&s;ed of for his own advantage. The Greeks of the&s;e villages have a &s;eparate governor, and enjoy many privileges. In particular they are allowed to wear a turban of white linen, and their churches have each a bell to call them to prayers, an indulgence of which they &s;peak with much glee. The A&s;iatic la|dies are exce&s;&s;ively fond of this gum, which they chew greedily, believing it good for the breath, and attributing to it various other excellent qualities.</P>
<P>Negropont, the ancient Eubaea, on the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t, is the large&s;t i&s;land in the Archipelago. It is
<PB N="101" REF="104">
ninety miles long, and about twenty broad. On the &s;outh-we&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land the &s;trait is &s;o nar|row, that it is joined to the continent of Attica, by a bridge. The walls of the town are two miles in circumference, and the &s;uburbs where the Chri&s;tians inhabit, are exten&s;ive. The Captain Ba&s;haw, or Admiral of the Turki&s;h fleet, is the viceroy of this i&s;land, and the adjacent parts of Greece; where he has a deputy, and a fleet of gallies generally lie in the port. What is very &s;ingular in this i&s;land, is the irregularity of the tides in the Euripus; the &s;trait which &s;eparates this i&s;land from the continent of Attica.</P>
<P>The tides are regular from the la&s;t three days of the old moon, to the eighth of the new; the ninth day they become irregular, and continue &s;o to the thirteenth; the fourteenth they are regular again, and continue thus to the twenty-fir&s;t; when they be|come irregular again, until the twenty-&s;eventh. When they are irregular, they flow twelve, thirteen, or fourteen times, and ebb as often in the four and twenty hours. When the tides are regular, they ob&s;erve the &s;ame rule according to the moon, as the tides in the ocean. But there is this difference at all times between the tides of the Euripus, and tho&s;e of the ocean; that the tides of the Euripus never ri&s;e above a foot, whereas tho&s;e of the ocean, in
<PB N="102" REF="105">
&s;ome places, ri&s;e twenty-four feet, in others not more than one foot. Between the ebbing and flow|ing of the Euripus, is a &s;mall &s;pace, where the water &s;eems to &s;tand &s;till, which it is not ob&s;erved to do in the ocean.</P>

files were upwards of a quarter of a league in length, and we counted thirty of them all &s;wimming in a &s;imilar direction. The head of this army terminated in a point, and re&s;embled the prow of a &s;hip. They all kept their po&s;ts, notwith&s;tanding the motion of the waves, with which they alternately ro&s;e and fell; their plumage, of a dazzling white, formed an ad|mirable contra&s;t with the tran&s;parent greenne&s;s of the waters. Farther on, we di&s;cerned another troop, di&s;po&s;ed in the &s;ame manner, all having their heads turned towards Africa, to which they &s;teered in concert.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds, at the approach of winter, fly the &s;nows and ice in the North, to &s;eek a milder climate. They fir&s;t arrive at the Black Sea, where they re|main for a time; and when the cold begins to in|crea&s;e too much there, again take their departure with a northerly wind, traver&s;e A&s;ia Minor, and re&s;t a while on the &s;hores of the Mediterranean. They afterwards pa&s;s this &s;ea, partly by &s;wimming, and partly by flying. In this manner they reach the coa&s;ts of Africa, and e&s;pecially Egypt; where the great lakes Menzala, and Buelos, furni&s;h them abun|dant food. There they remain all winter; but the &s;torks, which appear to be fond of a &s;till warmer climate, quit the&s;e lakes in November, proceed to|wards the Said, and end their journey at the lake

Maeris, and the canal of Jo&s;eph. They free the country from innumerable frogs, in&s;ects, and rep|tiles, which abound in the mar&s;hes. Such is the regular progre&s;s of the&s;e birds. On a &s;ignal given from their leaders, the&s;e winged navigators ri&s;e in the air, and fly all together, directing their cour&s;e towards the South. To cleave this element with more facility, they range them&s;elves in the form of a triangle, the vertex of which is a very acute angle. What wi&s;dom is di&s;played in the actions of creatures which to us &s;eem de&s;titute of rea&s;on! Fortunate, perhaps, in not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing that faculty &s;o frequently abu&s;ed by man; they do not counter-act the views of nature, and enjoy, without alloy, that portion of happine&s;s a&s;&s;igned them by the Creator.</P>
<P>Rhodes is about fifty miles in length, from North to South, and nearly half as much in breadth. An|cient hi&s;torians a&s;&s;ert, that it was called by the Greeks, Rhodes, from the great quantity of ro&s;es produced in it; Rhodes, &s;ignifying in that language, a ro&s;e. The poets feign it to have received its name from <HI>Rhoda,</HI> one of the daughters of <HI>Apollo,</HI> by <HI>Venus.</HI></P>
<P>Several authors a&s;&s;ert, that this i&s;land was formerly covered by the &s;ea; and that it rai&s;ed its humid head above the waters, and became an i&s;land; but they do
<PB N="105" REF="108">
not fix the time of this event, which is lo&s;t in the ob|&s;curity of ages: tradition however has pre&s;erved the memory of the fact, and the grave&s;t writers of anti|quity have admitted it as certain. Delos and Rhodes, &s;ays <HI>Pliny,</HI> tho&s;e celebrated i&s;lands, aro&s;e out of the &s;ea. Ancient annals a&s;&s;ert, &s;ays <HI>Pindar</HI> likewi&s;e, in one of his odes, that at the time when <HI>Jupiter</HI> and the immortals divided the earth, Rhodes had not yet appeared in the mid&s;t of the &s;ea; but was &s;till con|cealed in the profound aby&s;&s;es of the ocean. <HI>Philo</HI> attributes this event to the diminution of the waters of the &s;ea; and, were this opinion well-founded, mo&s;t of the i&s;lands of the Archipelago, being lower than Rhodes, mu&s;t have had the &s;ame origin.</P>
<P>It is much more rea&s;onable to imagine, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> that volcanic fires, (&s;uch as in the fourth year of the one hundred and thirty-fifth Olympiad, threw up from the aby&s;&s;es of the ocean, Theracia, and Thera, the modern Santorin, and which, in our time, have rai&s;ed above the waters, &s;even little i&s;lands near them) gave birth, in the remote ages of antiquity, to Rhodes.</P>
<P>In its center is a high mountain, which com|mands the whole i&s;land. It is called Artemira, and I imagine it to be the Mount Atabyris, &s;ays <HI>Savory,</HI> of <HI>Strabo.</HI> On it formerly was a temple of
<PB N="106" REF="109">
<HI>Jupiter,</HI> now no longer in exi&s;tence; but its place is &s;upplied by a &s;mall chapel, to which the Greeks make pilgrimages. Mount Artemira is very &s;teep, &s;o that it is impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;cend it on hor&s;eback; and on foot it takes four hours to reach the top. When there, we enjoy a mo&s;t magnificent pro&s;pect. On the edge of the horizon, towards the North-ea&s;t, we di&s;cover the &s;ummits of Mount Cragus; to the North, the high coa&s;t of Caramania; to the North-we&s;t, the &s;mall i&s;lands of the Archipelago, which appear like luminous points; to the South-we&s;t, the &s;ummit of Mount Ida, capped with clouds; and to the South, and South-ea&s;t, the va&s;t expan&s;e of waters which bathe the coa&s;ts of Africa. This exten&s;ive pro&s;pect varies every in&s;tant, as it is more or le&s;s illumined by the rays of the &s;un; and exhibits a moving &s;cenery, which a&s;toni&s;hes and delights the beholder. After contemplating this grand picture, the eye looks down with plea&s;ure on the i&s;land, which rounds it|&s;elf beneath our feet; and here and there we per|ceive, on the tops of the mo&s;t lofty hills, ancient pines planted by nature, that in ages pa&s;t formed thick fore&s;ts, which the Rhodians carefully pre&s;erved for their navy. At pre&s;ent the&s;e trees are not very nu|merous, as the Turks make u&s;e of them to build the Grand Signior's caravelles, and cut down without ever planting. Their &s;olitary &s;hades are at pre&s;ent
<PB N="107" REF="110">
the retreats of wild a&s;&s;es, which are remarkable for their &s;urpri&s;ing &s;wiftne&s;s.</P>
<P>Beyond the&s;e fir&s;t heights we meet with various amphitheatres of eminences, which become gradually lower, till we reach the &s;ea. The hills in general are covered with thorns, or brambles; but on &s;ome of them we find vineyards, which &s;till produce the perfumed wine in &s;uch reque&s;t among the ancients. This wine is very plea&s;ant to the ta&s;te, and leaves an exqui&s;ite flavour in the mouth. The Rhodians added the luxury of drinking it out of voluptuous cups. It would be ea&s;y to multiply the&s;e vines, and cover with them hills of a great extent, which are now lying without cultivation.</P>
<P>On the &s;hady &s;ummit of Mount Artemira, a great number of &s;prings ari&s;e, which fertilize the plains and vallies. Around the villages, we find a few cul|tivated &s;pots, and orchards; where the fig, pome|granate, and orange-tree, though planted without regularity or ta&s;te, afford plea&s;ing &s;hades. The peach-trees, which in the time of <HI>Pliny</HI> produced no fruit at Rhodes, are at pre&s;ent very fruitful; but the peaches they bear have neither the flavour nor the delicious juice of ours, as in this country they knew nothing of the art of grafting. The palm flouri&s;hes here, as in the days of <HI>Theophra&s;tus,</HI> but produces no
<PB N="108" REF="111">
fruit. There &s;eems to be a certain line drawn by nature for each &s;pecies of tree, beyond which &s;ome will not grow at all, and others become barren.</P>
<P>In pa&s;&s;ing over the i&s;land, we traver&s;e, with regret, beautiful vallies, without finding &s;o much as a village, a cottage, or even the &s;malle&s;t traces of cultivation. The bottoms of the rocks are covered with wild ro&s;es. Myrtles in flower perfume the air with their delicious emanations; and tufts of the laurel-ro&s;e adorn the banks of rivulets, with their beautiful flowers. The inhabitants &s;uffer the earth to nouri&s;h an infinity of u&s;ele&s;s plants, without endeavouring to direct, or profit, by its fecundity.</P>
<P>This i&s;land enjoys the happie&s;t temperature ima|ginable, and its air is pure and &s;alubrious. No epi|demical di&s;orders are known, but what are imported from other countries. The we&s;terly winds, which prevail for nine months in the year, moderate the heats of &s;ummer; and in the winter, ice, &s;now, and even hoar-fro&s;t are unknown. In the dulle&s;t day the &s;un di&s;per&s;es the clouds, and &s;hews him&s;elf, at lea&s;t, for &s;ome hours; through the whole year he enlightens the i&s;land with his beneficent rays, fertilizes the earth, and purifies the air, which is naturally humid. <HI>"Ti|berius"</HI> &s;ays <HI>Suctonius,</HI> "made a &s;tay for &s;ome time

at Rhodes, &s;o enchanted was he with the beauty and &s;alubrious climate of the i&s;land."</P>
<P>Ancient Rhodes &s;eems to have &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all the cities of the world, in beauty and magnificence. <HI>Strabo,</HI> who had travelled through &s;everal countries, and had &s;een Rome, Alexandria, Memphis, and the mo&s;t celebrated cities of A&s;ia, preferred Rhodes to any of them. "The beauty," &s;ays he, "of its har|bours, &s;treets and walls, and the magnificence of its monuments, render it &s;o much &s;uperior to all other cities, as to admit of no compari&s;on." <HI>Ari&s;tides</HI> likewi&s;e adds, "Within the walls of Rhodes, we ne|ver &s;aw a &s;mall hou&s;e by the &s;ide of a large one. All were of the &s;ame height, and the &s;ame order of ar|chitecture; &s;o that the whole city &s;eemed but one &s;ingle edifice. Wide &s;treets cro&s;&s;ed it from &s;ide to &s;ide; and the&s;e &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed, that from whatever part it was viewed, the pro&s;pect was truly magnificent. The walls and towers of a wonderful extent, height, and beauty, above all, excited our wonder. The lofty &s;ummits of the latter, &s;erved as a pharos to ma|riners. Such indeed was the magnificence of Rhodes, that without having &s;een it, the imagination cannot po&s;&s;ibly form any conception of its grandeur. All the parts of this immen&s;e town, mutually connected with each other, and mo&s;t beautifully proportioned, formed a perfect whole, of which the walls were the
<PB N="110" REF="113">
defence and ornament. Rhodes was the only city, of which it might be &s;aid, it was fortified like a place of war, and decorated like a palace."</P>
<P>To this de&s;cription we mu&s;t add &s;uperb temples, who&s;e porticos were enriched with paintings of the fir&s;t ma&s;ters; a multitude of colo&s;&s;u&s;es, and &s;tatues of a&s;toni&s;hing workman&s;hip; a magnificent theatre, exten&s;ive ar&s;enals, and fleets arriving from every part of the world, to pay the tribute due to the arts, from wealth. <HI>Pliny,</HI> after enumerating the mo&s;t famous colo&s;&s;al &s;tatues of antiquity, adds, "But none of the&s;e are to be compared to that which the Rhodians dedicated to the &s;un. This Colo&s;&s;us was the work of <HI>Chares,</HI> a pupil of <HI>Ly&s;ippus.</HI> It was &s;eventy cubits high, (about one hundred and five feet) and was thrown down by an earthquake, fifty-&s;ix years after it was fir&s;t erected. In this &s;tate its appearance is &s;till a&s;toni&s;hing. Few men are able to gra&s;p the thumb; and its fingers are larger than entire &s;tatues u&s;ually are: where it has been broken, we may di&s;cover, within-&s;ide, deep cavities filled with enormous &s;tones, which the arti&s;t had introduced, to render it firm on its ba&s;e. It is &s;aid to have been the labour of twelve years, and that it co&s;t three hundred talents; a &s;um which the Rhodians had gained, by the &s;ale of the warlike machines left by <HI>Demetrius,</HI> before their walls, when he rai&s;ed the &s;iege. This city contains an hun|dred
<PB N="111" REF="114">
other colo&s;&s;al &s;tatues, le&s;s indeed than this, but each of them &s;uperb enough to render any city illu&s;|trious, where they were erected. To the&s;e are to be added, five gigantic &s;tatues of the gods, the invalu|able works of <HI>Bryaxis.</HI></P>
<P>Some modern hi&s;torians, wi&s;hing to add &s;omething to the marvellous, have pretended the feet re&s;ted on two rocks, at the entrance of the harbour; and that ve&s;&s;els pa&s;&s;ed with all their &s;ails &s;et, between its legs. This fable de&s;erves no regard, &s;ince it is contradicted by the &s;ilence of antiquity. On the contrary, hi&s;to|rians who mention the fall of the Colo&s;&s;us, as well as tho&s;e who &s;aw it, te&s;tify that it was lying on the ground. <HI>Strabo</HI> &s;ays, "The Colo&s;&s;us of Rhodes, overthrown by a violent earthquake, and at pre&s;ent lying on the ground, has its knees broken. The Rhodians are forbidden, by an oracle, from rai&s;ing it up. This colo&s;&s;al &s;tatue, the mo&s;t beautiful ever con&s;ecrated to the gods by man, is placed among the &s;even wonders of the world." Had it been &s;ituated at the entrance of the harbour, it mu&s;t have fallen into the &s;ea, &s;ays <HI>Savary;</HI> which circum&s;tance they would not have omitted. It was &s;till in its fallen &s;tate, in the days of <HI>Pliny;</HI> as it likewi&s;e was, till the reign of the Emperor <HI>Con&s;tans;</HI> when <HI>Moawiah,</HI> general of the Caliph <HI>Othman,</HI> taking Rhodes, de&s;|troyed this &s;tatue; which had well de&s;erved to be
<PB N="112" REF="115">
enumerated among the &s;even wonders of the world. He &s;old it to a Jew, who conveyed its fragments to Eme&s;a, on nine hundred camels, nine hundred and thirty-two years after it was fir&s;t erected. <HI>Con&s;tantine Porphyrogenetus</HI> &s;ays it was &s;old to a Jew at Ede&s;&s;a, and increa&s;es prodigiou&s;ly the number of camels, which carried off its fragments, making them amount to thirty thou&s;and.</P>
<P>The arts &s;eemed to vie with each other, to con|tribute to the embelli&s;hment of Rhodes. Painting likewi&s;e di&s;puted the palm with &s;culpture. The tem|ples contained a multitude of admirable works, among which, &s;ays <HI>Strabo,</HI> "two pictures of <HI>Protogenes</HI> were particularly admired; the one repre&s;enting <HI>Jaly&s;as,</HI> and the other a &s;atyr, &s;tanding upon a column, with a partridge at his feet. The latter picture, being ex|po&s;ed to public view, the bird attracted univer&s;al ad|miration; &s;o that the &s;atyr, in the fini&s;hing of which the arti&s;t had employed his utmo&s;t attention and abi|lities, was almo&s;t entirely di&s;regarded. The wonder and applau&s;e of the &s;pectators was &s;till more increa&s;ed, when, on bringing &s;ome partridges before the picture, they began to call, as &s;oon as they perceived the painted bird; to the great delight of the multitude. <HI>Protogenes</HI> was &s;o mortified at the preference given to what be intended merely as an ornament, that he
<PB N="113" REF="116">
reque&s;ted permi&s;&s;ion, from, the prefect of the temple, to efface the partridge, and actually did efface it."</P>
<P><HI>Pliny</HI> thus de&s;cribes the picture of <HI>Jaly&s;us,</HI> men|tioned by <HI>Strabo.</HI> "The mo&s;t beautiful of the works of <HI>Protogenes,</HI> is the picture of <HI>Jaly&s;us,</HI> which is &s;till to be &s;een in the temple of Peace, at Rome. To &s;ecure it, if po&s;&s;ible, again&s;t the injuries of time, the painter placed four layers of colours one over the other, hoping that if the upper ones &s;hould decay, the lower would &s;till remain. In this picture we &s;ee a dog exqui&s;itely painted; chance having con&s;pired with art to render it perfect. The painter, after fini&s;hing every part of the animal, and having &s;ur|mounted every difficulty, was &s;o far &s;ati&s;fied with his work; but one thing &s;till remained, which he de&s;paired of being able perfectly to expre&s;s; this was the froth which whitens the mouth of a dog when panting; to repre&s;ent this defied his utmo&s;t art, and in every attempt he only &s;eemed to depart further from nature. The foam appeared always painted, and never natural. He was the more mor|tified, as he was never &s;atisfied, with any thing le&s;s than what might be mi&s;taken for nature it&s;elf. Often did he efface his colours, and as often change his bru&s;hes, without &s;ucce&s;s. Irritated at the im|potence of his art, he peevi&s;hly threw his &s;punge again&s;t the picture, which, by accident, &s;truck the
<PB N="114" REF="117">
mouth of the dog, and di&s;po&s;ed the colours more happily than his utmo&s;t &s;kill had been able to effect, chance for once happily imitating nature."</P>
<P><HI>Protogenes,</HI> and <HI>Apelles,</HI> his cotemporary, imi|tated nature &s;o perfectly, that their pictures &s;eemed living and animated beings. Let it not be imagined, however, that the arti&s;t born with the happie&s;t ta|lents, can ever attain this high degree of perfection, without prodigious efforts. Genius mu&s;t be &s;econded by the mo&s;t per&s;evering labour, and a profound knowledge of every &s;cience allied to his art. <HI>Proto|genes</HI> was &s;even years in fini&s;hing the picture of <HI>Ja|ly&s;us;</HI> and, if <HI>Pliny</HI> may be credited, during the whole time lived entirely on lupins, le&s;t by too much in|dulging his appetite, he &s;hould ob&s;truct the activity of his mind.</P>
<P>Do not imagine that Rhodes contained only a &s;mall number of excellent paintings. The porticos of its temples were decorated with pictures of infinite value. "The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one only of the&s;e immortal works", &s;ays <HI>Ari&s;tides,</HI> "would have &s;ufficed to render any city illu&s;trious."</P>
<P>The &s;ciences and literature ever go hand in hand with the fine arts. For the cultivation of the&s;e al&s;o were the Rhodians di&s;tingui&s;hed. Their &s;chools
<PB N="115" REF="118">
attained &s;o high a degree of celebrity, that they were re&s;orted to by &s;ome of the greate&s;t men of Rome; among whom were <HI>Cato, Marcus Brutus, Cicero, Ca&s;&s;ius, Cae&s;ar,</HI> and <HI>Pompey.</HI></P>
<P>To what mu&s;t we attribute the flouri&s;hing &s;tate of the Rhodian republic? To the fertility of the &s;oil, the beauty of the climate, or the excellent &s;ituation of the i&s;land? The&s;e advantages no doubt contri|buted to, but were not the efficient cau&s;e of, the wealth of the Rhodians, which was owing to the goodne&s;s of their laws, and the wi&s;dom of their go|vernment, the only &s;olid foundations of the glory of empires. "We cannot too much admire", &s;ays <HI>Strabo,</HI> "the care with which the Rhodians pre&s;erve their excellent code of laws, and the wi&s;dom con|&s;picuous in the whole con&s;titution of their republic, and e&s;pecially in the management of their navy. This has long pre&s;erved to them the empire of the &s;ea, which they have freed from pirates, and has &s;ecured to them the friend&s;hip of the Romans."</P>
<P>Rhodes was the emporium of every trading na|tion. The mariner who touched there, &s;ays <HI>Ari&s;tides,</HI> "beheld with a&s;toni&s;hment &s;everal harbours, formed by art, of piers of &s;tone, which advanced far into the &s;ea. One of the&s;e received the ve&s;&s;els from Ionia; another tho&s;e from Caria. Here a mole of|fered
<PB N="116" REF="119">
&s;helter to the fleets from Egypt, Cyprus, and Phoenicia, as if expre&s;sly formed for each re&s;pective city. Near to the ports, ar&s;enals reared their lofty heads, and a&s;toni&s;hed the beholder with their mag|nificence."</P>
<P>The Rhodians were worthy to inhabit this city. Their morals were mild and amiable, and their manners poli&s;hed without affectation. When they appeared in public, they were remarkable for the gravity of their deportment. They were not &s;een loitering in the &s;treets, but &s;eriou&s;ly reproved fo|reigners whom they &s;aw &s;trolling about in incon|&s;iderate idlene&s;s. At their tables, civility and urba|nity pre&s;ided; and all exce&s;s was bani&s;hed. They conver&s;ed in a free and friendly manner with their gue&s;ts, and never mortified them by a&s;&s;uming airs of importance. "The&s;e are the virtues", &s;ays <HI>Ari&s;tides,</HI> "which render your city &s;o renowned. The&s;e rai&s;e you above every other nation, and at|tract the love and admiration of every people. Your ancient and truly Grecian manners render you far more illu&s;trious than your ports, your walls, or your ar&s;enals."</P>
<P>Such a people could not but be humane. As for my&s;elf, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> I doubt, whether men po&s;&s;e&s;s a right to put other men to death, though guilty of
<PB N="117" REF="120">
enormous crimes. The Rhodians, however, &s;pared their fellow-citizens, the horror of the&s;e bloody tra|gedies, which di&s;honour our cities. Far from pre|paring &s;caffolds in public places; far from hiring de&s;picable mercenaries to publi&s;h in the &s;treets &s;en|tences which condemn unhappy wretches to the flames, or to the wheel; the law prohibited any exe|cutioner from entering Rhodes. Even the &s;entence of death was pronounced without the walls of the city. And they would have con&s;idered it as impiety, to &s;tain their &s;treets with human blood.</P>
<P>Ancient writers neverthele&s;s, particularly <HI>Athe|naeus,</HI> reproach the Rhodians with vices in&s;eparable from great wealth, luxury, and voluptuousne&s;s. "They build", likewi&s;e, &s;ays <HI>Stratonicus,</HI> "as if they were immortal, and &s;erve their tables with as much profu&s;ion, as if they had but a few days to live." The ve&s;&s;els they made u&s;e of in their repa&s;ts, were of an exqui&s;ite invention, and greatly renowned for the plea&s;ure they gave in drinking. In their compo&s;ition they employed myrrh, the flower of an odoriferous reed, &s;affron, balm, amoma, and cina|mon baked together. <HI>Anacreon</HI> reciting the number of his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es &s;ays, "for Rhodes, write down two thou&s;and." And we find the ancients call it the city of gallantry.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="121">The government of Rhodes was always repub|lican. At fir&s;t the &s;upreme power was lodged with the people. The nobles afterwards got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and formed an ari&s;tocracy. But they did not abu&s;e their power. Humanity led them to &s;uccour their fellow-citizens. They took care to prevent that wretchedne&s;s which is &s;o de&s;tructive to popula|tion; and created magi&s;trates, who&s;e &s;ole employ|ment was to prevent, or relieve, the nece&s;&s;ities of the poor; to provide the&s;e with whole&s;ome food, and employ them in the public works. This excellent regulation &s;ecured tranquility to the &s;tate, which never experienced tho&s;e violent convul&s;ions that at length overthrew Athens and Rome.</P>
<P>It was again&s;t this city, according to <HI>Diodorus Si|culus,</HI> that <HI>Demetrius</HI> advanced his moving citadel of wood, plated with iron, to batter down its walls. This edifice, called the Helepolis, was of a prodigi|ous &s;ize; it had nine &s;tories, and might be moved every way. Catapultas were employed again&s;t the walls, which threw prodigious &s;tones, and beams of an immen&s;e &s;ize, headed with iron; while battering rams, two hundred feet in length, and worked by a thou&s;and men at once, were &s;haking them with re|peated &s;trokes. A multitude of archers, placed on the top of the moving tower, &s;howered down their arrows on the be&s;ieged. Thirty thou&s;and &s;oldiers
<PB N="119" REF="122">
were employed to put the Helepolis in motion. The courage of a free people, however, triumphed over the fleets of <HI>Demetrius,</HI> the numerous army he had in pay, and all the military talents this great captain di&s;played, during a whole year, in his various attacks.</P>
<P>In fine, ever ob&s;ervant of their laws, and careful to maintain the commerce, to which they owed their power, they remained independent till the reign of <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian,</HI> who fir&s;t reduced this i&s;land to a Roman province. The power and riches of the inhabitants then di&s;appeared; and &s;ince that time, Rhodes, like Candia, has been only one of the fine i&s;lands of the Archipelago.</P>
<P>The modern town, built on the ruins of the ancient city, occupies only a quarter of its extent, and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es no remarkable antiquities. Not even the &s;malle&s;t remains of the theatres, temples, and porticos, are to be di&s;covered. Statues, colo&s;&s;u&s;es, paintings, all have been carried off. To wide and &s;kilfully di&s;|po&s;ed &s;treets; to tho&s;e regularly ranged edifices, where each front pre&s;ented the &s;ame order of archi|tecture, have &s;ucceeded narrow and winding lanes, and hou&s;es without ta&s;te, regularity, or decoration.

a &s;tranger, he would not recollect the &s;malle&s;t monu|ment, but mu&s;t imagine him&s;elf tran&s;ported into a country inhabited by barbarians.</P>
<P>The knights of Rhodes, have left various traces of their re&s;idence in the i&s;land. Their armorial en&s;igns, and &s;ome bu&s;ts of the grand ma&s;ters, &s;culptured in re|lief on marble, decorate the front of &s;everal buildings. The walls and towers they erected, &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t, and bear the glorious mark of an ob&s;tinate defence. The church of St. <HI>John</HI> has been converted into a mo&s;que. The va&s;t ho&s;pital, in which Chri&s;tian charity received the faithful from all parts of the world, and furni&s;hed them with &s;uccours, at this day &s;erves as a granary for the Turks. The barbarians &s;uffer it to go to ruin, as well as the government-hou&s;e, in which we find an|tique marbles and columns.</P>
<P>Rhodes has only two harbours. The &s;malle&s;t faces the Ea&s;t, and is called Darca. Rocks at a &s;mall di&s;|tance from each other, in the front, block the en|trance, and only leave room for one ve&s;&s;el to pa&s;s. Moles rai&s;ed on each &s;ide defend it from every wind. The Turks, who &s;ince the conque&s;t of the i&s;land, have not removed from it a &s;ingle grain of &s;and, &s;uffer it gradually to choak up. There is only water enough for merchant &s;hips, and even the&s;e are obliged to unload a part of their cargo before they can enter it.
<PB N="121" REF="124">
Ships go thither to careen, and caravelles are built there for the Grand Signior. This hand&s;ome ba&s;on might be made fit for the reception of large ve&s;&s;els, if the &s;ame means were employed to clear it, as are u&s;ed at Mar&s;eilles and other ports.</P>
<P>The other harbour is large, it bears the name of Rhodes; and in this frigates of thirty guns may an|chor. Ve&s;&s;els are here defended from We&s;terly winds, which prevail the greate&s;t part of the year. North, and North-ea&s;terly winds blow full into the harbour, and when violent, &s;hips are in danger of driving on the rocks, or again&s;t the walls of the town. Though Rhodes has retained none of its ancient &s;plendor, its advantageous &s;ituation, on the point of a promontory, its hou&s;es di&s;po&s;ed in the form of an am|phitheatre, the &s;olid &s;tructure of its walls, and its towers advanced upon the &s;hoals, give it an air of &s;trength and importance to mariners as they approach the city.</P>
<P>The i&s;land of Rhodes contains two cities; the ca|pital of the &s;ame name, and the ancient Lindus. Of the three cities founded, according to the ancient fable, by the children of the &s;un, Lindus alone has left any remarkable ve&s;tiges. Calirus and Jali&s;us, mentioned by <HI>Strabo,</HI> are totally de&s;troyed. "Leaving Rhodes," &s;ays <HI>Strabo,</HI> "and &s;ailing on with the coa&s;t to the
<PB N="122" REF="125">
right, the fir&s;t city we arrive at is Lindus, &s;ituated on the South-&s;ide of the i&s;land, and oppo&s;ite Alexandria. The traveller then admires the famous temple of the Lindian <HI>Minerva,</HI> built by the daughters of <HI>Danaus." Cadmus</HI> enriched it with magnificent offerings. The inhabitants, here, con&s;ecrated the &s;eventh ode of <HI>Pin|dar's</HI> Olympics, which they in&s;cribed in letters of gold. The ruins of this noble edifice, are &s;till vi&s;ible on an edifice near the &s;ea. The remains of its walls, which were built with enormous &s;tones, di&s;cover the Egyp|tian ta&s;te. On the highe&s;t part of the rock, we per|ceive the ruins of a ca&s;tle that &s;erved as a fortre&s;s to the town; it occupied a large &s;pace which is now filled with rubbi&s;h.</P>
<P>The modern Lindus, is &s;ituated at the foot of this hill; a deep bay, which runs up far into the land, &s;erves it as a harbour. Before the building of Rhodes, this port was re&s;orted to by the fleets of Egypt and of Tyre. It was enriched by commerce; and a wi&s;e government, profiting by its harbour and &s;ituation, might &s;till render it a flouri&s;hing city.</P>
<P>The &s;oil of Rhodes is dry and &s;andy, but the nu|merous &s;prings with which it is watered, render it ex|tremely fertile. Corn thrives here admirably. Its yellow and heavy grain, affords a flour as white as &s;now, which makes excellent bread. If half of the
<PB N="123" REF="126">
country capable of growing it were cultivated, the Rho|dians would have far more than &s;ufficient for their con&s;umption, and might export to foreign countries. But the Turks are no cultivators; and the Greeks, di&s;|couraged by the fear of not enjoying the fruits of their labour, let the fine&s;t fields lie barren. It is cer|tain, that a &s;ingle word from the Pacha, would enrich the country with the trea&s;ures of agriculture. He is ab&s;olute, and has but to a&s;&s;ure the hu&s;bandman of his protection; but he knows not whether he &s;hall him|&s;elf be in place to-morrow, and would be fearful of labouring for the advantage of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. Be&s;ides, a &s;till more powerful rea&s;on prevents him from en|deavouring any improvement: the mi&s;ery of the country con&s;titutes his wealth. Rhodes not furni&s;h|ing &s;ufficient corn for the &s;upport of its inhabitants, he &s;ends to purcha&s;e the grain of Caramania, at a low rate. He has this conveyed to market in &s;mall quan|tities, to enhance the price. But what is &s;till more oppre&s;&s;ive, is, that the rate fixed for the fir&s;t bu&s;hel of the new crop, &s;erves as the &s;tandard price for all that is &s;old during the remainder of the year. This infamous monopoly, which rapidly enriches tho&s;e who are concerned in it, is productive of the mo&s;t fatal con|&s;equences to commerce, agriculture, and the indu&s;try of the inhabitants. What, indeed, can be expected from a nation in want of the fir&s;t nece&s;&s;aries of life? What exchanges can they make with foreign coun|tries,
<PB N="124" REF="127">
if their own be in&s;ufficient for their &s;upport, and they have neither art nor manufactures? And, indeed, the univer&s;al poverty, and frightful depopu|lation of the i&s;land, are indelible proofs of the vices of the government.</P>
<P>There are computed to be &s;even thou&s;and families in the i&s;land; which, reckoning five per&s;ons to a fa|mily, gives thirty-&s;ix thou&s;and inhabitants nearly; of the&s;e, two-thirds are Turks, and the remainder Greeks. But the i&s;land is more than forty leagues in circumference. Here then is a va&s;t &s;pace, occupied by fewer people than is contained in a moderate town in England. The &s;tate of the revenues of the i&s;land, perfectly corre&s;ponds with the &s;mall number and poverty of the Rhodians.</P>

<P>THE ancient Crete, called al&s;o Macaron, or Macarone&s;us, <HI>i. e.</HI> the fortunate i&s;land, in al|lu&s;ion to its fertility and the purity of the air, is one of the large&s;t i&s;lands in the Mediterranean, being in length above two hundred miles, and in breadth, in &s;ome parts, about &s;ixty. This i&s;land, which in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;eparates the Archipelago from the Mediter|ranean, is formed by a long chain of mountains, extending from We&s;t to Ea&s;t, &s;ays <HI>Tott,</HI> and may be con&s;idered as a continuation of tho&s;e which, from the North of the Adriatic, pa&s;s over the Morea, and appear again in Caramania, where they join Mount Libanon. The mountains &s;tanding thick together on the South-&s;ide, among which Mount Ida, that fa|mous mountain of antiquity, towers far above the re&s;t, render this i&s;land almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible towards the Mediterranean, whence the North-&s;ide derives all the advantages of culture, of which a bad &s;oil can be &s;u&s;ceptible. It is likewi&s;e to the excellence of the climate, that it owes the richne&s;s of its pro|ductions.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="132">Among all the countries I have &s;een, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> there is none who&s;e temperature is &s;o healthy and &s;o agreeable as that of Crete. The heats there are not exce&s;&s;ive; and violent cold is ab&s;olutely unknown in the plains. The winter, properly &s;peaking, begins only in December, and ends in January. During this &s;hort &s;ea&s;on, &s;now never falls in the plain, and rarely is the &s;urface of the water frozen. The name of winter is given to the&s;e two months from the heavy rains, the cloudy &s;ky, and violent North winds, which blow at this time of the year. No &s;ooner is the month of February pa&s;t, than the earth is adorned with flowers and harve&s;ts. The re&s;t of the year is almo&s;t one continued fine day. We never experienced, as in France, &s;ays the above author, tho&s;e cruel returns of piercing cold, which nip the opening flowers, de&s;troy the fruits of the year, and are &s;o prejudicial to delicate con&s;titutions. The &s;ky is continually &s;erene, and the winds mild and temperate. The glorious luminary of the day runs his maje&s;tic cour&s;e through the azure vault, and ripens the fruits of the hills and plains. Nor are the nights le&s;s delightful: a delicious coolne&s;s then pre|vails; and the air, le&s;s charged with vapours than with us, di&s;covers a greater number of &s;tars to the ob&s;erver. The blue vault of heaven &s;parkles with gold, diamonds, and rubies, which &s;eem to dart forth brighter fires. Nothing can be more mag|nificent
<PB N="130" REF="133">
than this &s;pectacle, which the Cretans enjoy for ten months in the year.</P>
<P>To the charms of &s;o delightful a climate, are added other advantages, which enhance their value. The i&s;land of Crete has hardly any mar&s;hes. The waters there are never &s;tagnant; but flowing from the &s;um|mits of the mountains, in innumerable &s;treams, form delightful fountains, or &s;mall rivers which lo&s;e them|&s;elves in the &s;ea. The elevation of the ground cau&s;es them to have a rapid cour&s;e, and they form neither lakes nor ponds. For this rea&s;on, in&s;ects cannot depo&s;it their eggs in them, which would be carried into the &s;ea; and the inhabitants are not tormented, as in Egypt, with tho&s;e clouds of gnats, of which the &s;ting is &s;o painful. For the &s;ame rea&s;on al&s;o, the air is not loaded with tho&s;e dangerous va|pours which ri&s;e from the mar&s;hes in wet countries.</P>
<P>The hills and ri&s;ing grounds, are clothed with va|rious &s;pecies of thyme, &s;avory, &s;erpolet, odoriferous rock-ro&s;es, and a variety of plants. Myrtles and lau|rel-ro&s;es border the rivulets which meander through the vallies. On every &s;ide the country pre&s;ents groves of orange, lemon, and almond-trees. The Arabian je&s;&s;amine blooms in the gardens, which in the &s;pring are decorated with beds of violets. Va&s;t fields are covered with &s;affron; wild dittany,
<PB N="131" REF="134">
which has a very fragrant &s;mell, lines the crevices of the rocks: in a word, the mountains, vallies, and plains, exhale, on all &s;ides, aromatic odours, which perfume the air, and render it delicious to re&s;pire. Clouds, ice, and &s;now, are afflicting objects, which throw a mournful veil over the face of nature; they pre&s;ent to the eye, gloomy images, and excite in the mind melancholy reflections, and painful feelings in the heart. Nay, not unfrequently, they are in|jurious to the health, and produce a general indi&s;|po&s;ition. But a clear &s;ky has an effect the very rever&s;e.</P>
<P>When we travel through different countries, or even through di&s;tant provinces of the &s;ame kingdom, the change of air is perceived in a very &s;en&s;ible man|ner. This impre&s;&s;ion indeed is greater or le&s;s, ac|cording to the greater or le&s;s degree of &s;en&s;ibility of every individual; nor does it wholly depend on the accidental circum&s;tances of cold or heat. We feel in re&s;piring the vital element, an odour, a ta&s;te, a &s;avour, which vary according to circum&s;tances, and the varieties of climates and &s;ea&s;ons. The&s;e &s;en&s;a|tions produce plea&s;ure, or an uncomfortable feel|ing, as they are &s;uitable, or contrary, to the actual &s;tate of our con&s;titution; nor are we to e&s;teem this extraordinary: the exhalations from the earth, waters, plants, and flowers, incorporate with the atmo|&s;phere,
<PB N="132" REF="135">
and compo&s;e the air we breathe. Every man of under&s;tanding, therefore, who has any regard for his health, ought not to be indifferent concerning the choice of his habitation; as, on it, in a great mea&s;ure, depends the pre&s;ervation of that mo&s;t va|luable ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>The in&s;tant I landed on the coa&s;t of Alexandria, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> I enhaled a fiery air, with which I was nearly &s;uffocated; I felt a moi&s;t and debilitating heat, which rendered me languid, and deprived me of all &s;trength of body, or vigour of mind. I concluded it was impo&s;&s;ible I could live in &s;uch a country; but a copious per&s;piration pre&s;ently taking place, the violent heat of my blood dimini&s;hed, and I &s;oon found my&s;elf greatly relieved. In the beginning of the &s;pring, when the orange-trees round Damietta were in flower, and filled the atmo&s;phere with their fragrance; when heat, as yet only moderate, left the body in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of its energy and activity, I ta&s;ted, in the mo&s;t lively manner, the charms of &s;o delicious a temperature, breathed with rapture a fre&s;h and perfumed air, and every pul&s;ation of the heart was an enjoyment. This plea&s;ure, though every moment repeated, never produced &s;atiety.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame places, when in the month of July, the hu&s;bandman had turned up the mud of the mo|ra&s;&s;es,
<PB N="133" REF="136">
to plant his rice, the atmo&s;phere became loaded with exhalations, which oppre&s;&s;ed the brea&s;t, and ob&s;tructed re&s;piration. The faces of the inha|bitants were di&s;coloured; &s;ickne&s;s became general; and, had not the northerly winds, which prevail at that &s;ea&s;on, cha&s;ed away the malignant vapours, and the earth been very &s;oon covered with harve&s;ts, the mo&s;t violent di&s;tempers would have en&s;ued.</P>
<P>In fact, &s;o large a river as the Nile, flowing through, and periodically inundating Egypt, cannot but render the air humid, which moderates the heat of the &s;un, and renders the country habitable. The air there is very &s;alutary to the lungs; di&s;orders of the brea&s;t are unknown; and <HI>Galen,</HI> who &s;tudied at Alexandria, and was well acquainted with the na|ture of the climate, &s;ent thither all his patients with pulmonary complaints, and they commonly found the cure they &s;ought.</P>
<P>The beauty of man, his powers and his health, depend in general on the climate he inhabits; his food, and the nature of his occupations. In Crete, the Turk who is not tormented by ambition, or the thir&s;t of wealth, who&s;e mind is never occupied by the chimeras of intrigue, who knows not envy, nor exhau&s;ts him&s;elf in the pur&s;uit of &s;ciences, to which we too often &s;acrifice our health; the Turk who
<PB N="134" REF="137">
lives on whole&s;ome and &s;imple aliments, and pa&s;&s;es his days amid the flowery fields he cultivates, grows and ri&s;es into a Colo&s;&s;us. The &s;alubrity of the air he breathes, the &s;weet temperature he enjoys, the delightful &s;cenes perpetually before his eyes, and the peaceful life he leads, all contribute to &s;trengthen his body, and pre&s;erve his vigour, even beneath the &s;nows of age. Hither the &s;culptor, devoted to his art, and emulating the ancients, &s;hould come in &s;earch of models. He would &s;ee young men of eighteen or twenty, &s;ix feet high, who po&s;&s;e&s;s all the graces peculiar to their time of life. Their mu&s;cles have &s;till a little plumpne&s;s, which will &s;oon a&s;&s;ume a bolder character; their cheeks, gracefully rounded, di&s;play an animated carnative, and their eyes are full of fire.</P>
<P>In men arrived at maturity, the features and out|lines are more developed. Their legs are naked; and when their robes are lifted up, the mu&s;cles ap|pear boldly prominent: their arms exhibit tho&s;e &s;igns of &s;trength, which were vi&s;ible in tho&s;e of the ancient athletae: their &s;houlders are broad, their che&s;ts full, and their necks never &s;traitened by the ligatures, which from infancy confine tho&s;e of the Europeans, retain all the beautiful proportions a&s;|&s;igned to that part by nature: no tight breeches or garters bind the legs below the knee; that part of
<PB N="135" REF="138">
their leg therefore is never di&s;torted or contracted, nor is the knee too prominent. In a word, all their limbs, unaccu&s;tomed to the fetters which confine our motion, and which habit alone could render &s;up|portable, pre&s;erve their natural form, and that ad|mirable &s;ymmetry which con&s;titutes male beauty. When they &s;tand erect, all parts of the body pro|perly &s;upport each other. When they walk, they move with an air of dignity, and bodily &s;trength and firmne&s;s of mind di&s;play them&s;elves in every ge&s;ture. Their maje&s;tic eye announces that they are ac|cu&s;tomed to command. Pride and &s;everity, may &s;ometimes be apparent in their looks, but never meanne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Mahometans, who inhabit the i&s;land of Crete, are &s;uch, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> as I have here repre&s;ented them. They are in general from &s;ix feet to &s;ix feet five inches high. They re&s;emble the ancient &s;ta|tues; and in fact &s;uch were the men the arti&s;ts of antiquity took for their models. In a country where the men are &s;o remarkable for bodily &s;trength, and dignity of a&s;pect, it may fairly be concluded, that the women cannot be wanting in beauty and the graces. Their dre&s;s does not prevent the growth of any part of their body, but is accommodated to tho&s;e admirable proportions with which the Creator has decorated the mo&s;t lovely of his works. All
<PB N="136" REF="139">
are not hand&s;ome, all do not po&s;&s;e&s;s charms; but &s;ome of them are extremely beautiful, particularly among the Turks. In general the Cretan women have a luxuriant bo&s;om; a neck gracefully rounded; black eyes, full of fire; a &s;mall mouth; a no&s;e per|fectly well made, and cheeks which health tinges with the &s;ofte&s;t vermillion. But the oval of their faces is different from that of the women in Europe, and the character of their beauty is peculiar to their nation.</P>
<P>During the fir&s;t year or two of my travels in the Ea&s;tern countries, accu&s;tomed as I had been to the elegant head dre&s;s of the ladies of France, I could not endure the black hair of the Oriental women. So difficult is it for rea&s;on to di&s;engage it&s;elf from the fetters of habit. But after more mature reflec|tion, their long black locks, artificially plaited, with|out either powder or pomatum, appeared to me well calculated to heighten their beauty. The ebon co|lour of their hair &s;eemed to give more lu&s;tre to the fairne&s;s of their complexions, and the glow of their cheeks. The ro&s;e-water, with which they wa&s;h their hair, exhaled an agreeable perfume; and I was de|lighted with the natural beauty of their tre&s;&s;es. I then changed my opinion, and could not help wi&s;h|ing that the European women would not &s;poil one of
<PB N="137" REF="140">
their mo&s;t charming ornaments with the colours of art, &s;o much inferior to tho&s;e of nature.</P>
<P>The Greeks, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> who inhabit the i&s;land of Candia, partake indeed with the Turks, the ad|vantages of a &s;erene &s;ky, a pure air, and a happy temperature; but they are oppre&s;&s;ed by tyrants. They live in perpetual anxiety and apprehen&s;ion, and frequently terminate their mi&s;erable lives in de&s;pair. Excepting the Spaehiots, who are le&s;s expo&s;ed to tyranny; the&s;e unfortunate beings have neither the lofty &s;tature, the &s;trength, nor the beauty of the Turks. The &s;tamp of &s;ervitude is vi&s;ible in their faces; their looks are crouching, and their features di&s;torted by knavery and meanne&s;s. Such is the character of tho&s;e Cretans, who were once &s;o jealous of their liberty; tho&s;e experienced and intrepid warriors, who were courted by all na|tions; and tho&s;e friends to the arts, which they cul|tivated amid their &s;hady groves. At pre&s;ent, cow|ardly and indolent, they live in deba&s;ement, and we may read in their degraded countenances, that <HI>they are &s;laves.</HI></P>
<P>The i&s;land of Candia does not produce a multitude of reptiles. Very few &s;erpents, and tho&s;e only &s;mall ones, are to be found in it. The ancients affirmed, that this beautiful country contained no noxious
<PB N="138" REF="141">
animals. <HI>Pliny</HI> excepts the tarantula, which <HI>Belon,</HI> who has written on the natural and artificial curio&s;ities of Greece, calls <HI>Phalangion.</HI> They a&s;&s;ert its poi&s;on is mortal. It is a &s;ort of &s;pider, almo&s;t an inch long, with a &s;caly coat. It hollows out in the &s;ides of little eminences, a pretty deep hole, which it covers with a &s;trong web of cro&s;s threads glued together. This little pa&s;&s;age, at the bottom of which it lodges, is clo&s;ed externally by a valve, that prevents the rain from penetrating; and which it opens when going in que&s;t of in&s;ects, and clo&s;es again when it re-enters. If two or three of the&s;e tarantulas are &s;hut up in a gla&s;s phial, they &s;ting each other, and die &s;oon after.</P>
<P>The quadrupeds of the i&s;land are not mi&s;chievous; we neither meet with lions, tigers, bears, wolves, nor even foxes; in &s;hort, no dangerous animal. The wild-goats are the only inhabitants of the fore&s;ts, which cover the high mountains, and have nothing to fear but the gun of the hunter. Hares are found on the eminences and in the plains. The &s;heep feed in &s;afety on the various &s;pecies of wild thyme. They are folded every evening, and the &s;hepherd &s;leeps in peace, free from the dread of &s;eeing death and havock &s;pread among his flock by wild bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>It is a happine&s;s for the Cretans, that they are neither troubled with mu&s;quitos, nor have any thing
<PB N="139" REF="142">
to apprehend from the poi&s;on of &s;erpents, or the fe|rocity of wild bea&s;ts. The young and lively maiden may dance upon the gra&s;s, without finding, like <HI>Eu|rydice,</HI> a viper concealed among the flowers. The ancients a&s;cribed the&s;e &s;ingular advantages to its being the birth-place of <HI>Jupiter.</HI> "The Cretans, &s;ays <HI>Aelian,</HI> celebrate in their &s;ongs the bounties of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and the favour he has granted their i&s;land, his native and nur&s;ing land, of being free from every noxious animal, and of not even nouri&s;hing tho&s;e which may be brought into it."</P>
<P>Among the medicinal plants, dittany holds the fir&s;t rank. It is a&s;toni&s;hing, how highly the ancients have extolled its virtues. <HI>Theophra&s;tus,</HI> who gives us the received opinions of his time, &s;ays, "Of all the known plants which the earth has produced, dittany is the mo&s;t precious." The father of medicine, the celebrated <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> ordered an infu&s;ion of it to be given in &s;everal di&s;orders of women, and e&s;pecially during the pains of a difficult labour. For this rea&s;on, the &s;tatue of <HI>Diana,</HI> was, according to &s;ome writers, crowned with dittany.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not here repeat, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> in his de&s;crip|tion of this i&s;land, with &s;everal authors, that the wild goats when wounded by the arrows of the hunter, freed them&s;elves from them by eating this precious
<PB N="140" REF="143">
plant; that it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the virtue of healing them, even when the arrows were poi&s;oned; and that its odour was &s;o powerful as to drive away venemous reptiles; and de&s;troy them, if it only touched them. The&s;e accounts are evidently exaggerated; but we are po&s;|&s;ibly, on the other hand, too indifferent to the real utility medicine might derive from this plant. Its leaf is extremely bal&s;amic, and the flower diffu&s;es a delicious fragrance. The inhabitants, at pre&s;ent, apply it very &s;ucce&s;sfully on many occa&s;ions. An in|fu&s;ion of the dried leaf, with a little &s;ugar, yields a liquor more plea&s;ing to the palate, and more finely flavoured than tea. It immediately removes languor of the &s;tomach, and re&s;tores it after dige&s;tion.</P>
<P>Dittany is peculiar to the i&s;land of Crete, and is not to be found in any other country. It grows in the crevices of the rocks, and at the foot of precipices. <HI>Pliny</HI> has not &s;ufficiently di&s;criminated it; "Dittany, &s;ays he, has &s;lender branches, re&s;embles penny-royal, and is hot and rough to the ta&s;te; its leaves only are made u&s;e of; it has neither flower, &s;talk, nor &s;eed." <HI>Virgil</HI>'s de&s;cription is more conformable to truth. "This plant bears &s;hagged leaves, which are crowned with purple flowers. The wild goats find in it a remedy, when wounded by the winged arrow."</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="144">In a country where the air is extremely pure, di&s;|orders are not frequent; there are no epidemical di&s;ea&s;es in this i&s;land. Fevers are, indeed, frequent in the &s;ummer, but not attended with danger; and the plague would never make its appearance, had not the Turks de&s;troyed the lazaretto's, erected by the Venetians. Since then, it has been brought occa|&s;ionally by the &s;hips from Smyrna and Con&s;tanti|nople.</P>
<P>But a malady, which though le&s;s dangerous than the plague, has &s;omething even more hideous in its &s;ymp|toms, infects this beautiful country. I mean the le|pro&s;y. This di&s;order had its ancient &s;eat in Syria, whence it has pa&s;&s;ed into many of the i&s;lands of the Archipelago. It is contagious, and in&s;tantly com|municated by the touch. Tho&s;e unhappy wretches, who are attacked by it, are confined to little huts, built on the &s;ides of the highways; from which they are not allowed to come out, or conver&s;e with any per&s;on. They u&s;ually have a &s;mall garden round their cottages, that &s;upplies them with vegetables and poultry; with which, and the alms they receive from pa&s;&s;engers, they drag on a mi&s;erable exi&s;tence. Their bloated &s;kin is covered with a &s;caly cru&s;t, full of red and white &s;pots, which occa&s;ion intolerable itchings. They beg relief in a hoar&s;e and hollow voice, at the very &s;ound of which you are apt to &s;hudder; their
<PB N="142" REF="145">
words are &s;carcely articulate, as the di&s;order is inter|nally de&s;troying the organs of &s;peech. The&s;e wretch|ed &s;pectres gradually lo&s;e the u&s;e of their limbs; and live till, the whole ma&s;s of blood becoming corrupt, death is the con&s;equence of putrefaction. No &s;ight can be more melancholy or more &s;hocking, than that of a leper; no torments are comparable to tho&s;e that he endures.</P>
<P>The rich are not attacked by this malady, which confines it&s;elf to the lower cla&s;s of people, and par|ticularly to tho&s;e among the Greeks, who ob&s;erve &s;trictly their four lents, and live, during that time, on nothing but &s;alt fi&s;h, pickled olives, and chee&s;e; and drink copiou&s;ly of the thick heavy wines of the i&s;land. It is po&s;&s;ible this diet may inflame and thicken their blood, and at length be the cau&s;e of the lepro&s;y. I am led to &s;u&s;pect this, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> from having ob&s;erved that this di&s;order never manife&s;ts it&s;elf among &s;uch of the Turks as are rich enough to pro|cure animal food the whole year, with rice and vegetables; nor even among the Greeks, who in|habit the mountains, and eat plentifully of &s;allads, fruits, and milk.</P>
<P>Elated with having been the birth-place of <HI>Ju|piter,</HI> and proud of her hundred cities, Crete long continued more powerful than the other i&s;lands of
<PB N="143" REF="146">
the Mediterranean. At pre&s;ent her glory is eclip&s;ed. Time has not &s;pared a &s;ingle one of all her cities, of which we &s;ee nothing but the ruins. Candia is the modern capital, and has given its name to the i&s;land.</P>
<P>The three cities, Candia, Canea and Rhetimo, are the &s;eats of the three Pachalies, into which the Otto|man government has divided this i&s;land. The fir&s;t, who enjoys the title of Sera&s;kier, has pre-eminence over the other two.</P>
<P>Candia, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> is the &s;eat of the Turki&s;h go|vernment. The Porte u&s;ually &s;ends thither a Pacha with three tails. Here al&s;o the principal officers and different corps of the Ottoman &s;oldiery are a&s;&s;embled. This city, &s;o rich, populous, and commercial, under the Venetian government, is greatly fallen from its ancient grandeur. The harbour, which is a hand|&s;ome ba&s;on, where &s;hips are &s;heltered from every wind, is daily filling up, and at pre&s;ent only capable of receiving boats and &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, lightened of a part of their cargo. Tho&s;e freighted by the Turks at Candia, are obliged to proceed, almo&s;t in balla&s;t, to wait for their loading in the ports of Standia, four leagues di&s;tant, where it is brought to them in &s;mall barks. The&s;e difficulties, which the Turks do not
<PB N="144" REF="147">
endeavour to remedy, are very detrimental to com|merce; which, accordingly, has extremely declined.</P>
<P>Candia, greatly embelli&s;hed by the Venetians, is divided into &s;trait &s;treets, and decorated with well-built hou&s;es, a hand&s;ome &s;quare, and a magnificent fountain; but contains, within its exten&s;ive walls, only a &s;mall number of inhabitants. Several quarters of the town are almo&s;t de&s;erted. That of the market is the only one in which we perceived activity or af|fluence. The Mahometans have converted the great|e&s;t part of the Chri&s;tian temples into mo&s;ques. They have left, however, two churches for the Greeks; one for the Armenians; and a &s;ynagogue for the Jews. The capuchins have a &s;mall convent, with a chapel, in which the French vice-con&s;ul hears ma&s;s; for, at pre&s;ent, he is the only per&s;on of that nation who re|&s;ides at Candia, the French merchants having retired to Canea.</P>
<P>The river to the we&s;t of Candia, was anciently called the Triton; and near its &s;ource, <HI>Minerva</HI> was born of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> whence is derived the epithet Trito|genes. Beyond is a river, on who&s;e banks, according to the fables of antiquity, <HI>Jupiter</HI> celebrated his nup|tials with <HI>Juno.</HI> In the &s;pace of more than half a league round the walls of Candia, we do not meet with a &s;ingle tree. The country beyond abounds in
<PB N="145" REF="148">
corn and fruit-trees, and the adjacent hills, covered with vineyards, yields the malm&s;ey of Mount Ida, worthy a place at the table of epicures. This wine, little known in France, is perfumed, of a very agree|able flavour, and in high e&s;timation in this country.</P>
<P>At no great di&s;tance from Candia, are the ruins of Cno&s;&s;us, called by the Greeks <HI>Cno&s;&s;ou.</HI> This was the royal city of <HI>Minos,</HI> who e&s;tabli&s;hed there the &s;eat of his empire, and gave tho&s;e wi&s;e and admirable laws &s;o ju&s;tly boa&s;ted by antiquity. This city, &s;ays <HI>Strabo,</HI> was a league and an half in circuit, and long con|tinued one of the mo&s;t celebrated of the i&s;land. United with <HI>Gortyna, Polybius,</HI> mentions, that it gave law to almo&s;t all Crete; but falling afterwards into misfortunes, <HI>Gortyna</HI> and <HI>Lyctos</HI> profited by its de|cline, and Cno&s;&s;us was for a time &s;tript of almo&s;t all its &s;plendor; but &s;oon repairing the&s;e lo&s;&s;es, again re&s;umed its &s;tation among&s;t the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing cities of Greece. The Romans, to &s;ecure their conque&s;ts, e&s;tabli&s;hed a numerous colony there. At length, in the thirteenth year of the reign of <HI>Nero,</HI> the whole i&s;land &s;uffering by a violent earthquake, Cno&s;&s;us was totally de&s;troyed. The lightning, during this tremen|dous calamity, &s;ays <HI>Philo&s;tratus,</HI> did not proceed from the clouds, but from the earth, and the &s;ea retreated &s;even &s;tadia. Several tombs, according to <HI>Suidas,</HI> bur&s;t open; in one of which was found the works of
<PB N="146" REF="149">
<HI>Dictys</HI> of Crete, containing die events of the Trojan war.</P>
<P>From that time, the lofty Cno&s;&s;us, humbled in the du&s;t, has never ri&s;en from her ruins; but heaps of &s;tones, ancient walls half demoli&s;hed, the remains of edifices, and the name of <HI>Cno&s;&s;ou,</HI> which the &s;pot it &s;tood on &s;till retains, enable us to a&s;&s;ign its ancient &s;ituation. The&s;e ruins were, no doubt, much more con&s;iderable before the building of Candia; becau&s;e, as they were &s;o near, it may well be &s;uppo&s;ed the Ve|netians made u&s;e of them, as materials for the ram|parts and hou&s;es of that capital.</P>
<P>About four leagues to the South of Candia, on the &s;ummit of a very deep mountain, are a heap of &s;tones, half eaten away by time, which the inhabitants of the country call the tomb of <HI>Jupiter.</HI> The third <HI>Jupiter,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Cicero,</HI> &s;on of <HI>Saturn,</HI> who was king of Crete, has a tomb in that i&s;land. <HI>Jupiter</HI> having ended his days in Crete, his relations, in obedience to his la&s;t commands, erected a temple and tomb to his memory. The temple &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in the days of <HI>Plato.</HI> This philo&s;opher, who was well acquainted with the places he de&s;cribes, &s;peaks of it thus in his fir&s;t book of laws. "The road which leads from Cno&s;&s;us to the cavern and temple of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> is very plea&s;ant. We con|tinually meet with alleys of large tufted trees, who&s;e
<PB N="147" REF="150">
foliage &s;helters us from the &s;corching heat of the &s;un. If we proceed &s;till further, we find woods of cypre&s;s-trees, of &s;urpri&s;ing height and beauty; by the &s;ide of which, are delightful meadows, where travellers may repo&s;e and conver&s;e."</P>
<P>From all the&s;e authorities we may conclude, that a man called <HI>Jupiter,</HI> who, by great actions, merited well of his &s;ubjects, and on whom divine honours were be&s;towed, died in the i&s;land of Crete; that a temple was erected to him, which has been de&s;troyed by time; that a tomb was &s;hewn with an in&s;cription on it, till the time of the Roman emperors; and that, at pre&s;ent, there is to be &s;een about three leagues from Cno&s;&s;us, an eminence, commonly called mount Icarus; on the top of which, the inhabitants of the country point out a heap of &s;tones, which they call the tomb of <HI>Jupiter.</HI> As for the &s;acred cavern in which he was brought up, and to which <HI>Minos</HI> repaired every ninth year, to conver&s;e with his father, and receive his laws, it may be pre&s;umed not to have been far di&s;tant; but, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> we did not &s;ee it.</P>
<P>In the mountains, and on the road from Candia to Canea, is a convent of Greek monks, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing ex|ten&s;ive lands, which the Turks have left them, on con|dition of their exerci&s;ing ho&s;pitality towards all tra|vellers, which they commonly do with a tolerable
<PB N="148" REF="151">
good grace. Both riders and hor&s;es are lodged and &s;upplied with provi&s;ions. The&s;e hou&s;es, in a country where there are neither inns nor caravan&s;eras, are of great u&s;e. Without them, the traveller would be obliged to carry with him a load of baggage, and every nece&s;&s;ary of life.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we alighted at the above convent, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> &s;everal children came to take our hor&s;es by the bridles, and walk them about for a quarter of an hour, before they put them into the &s;table. This cu&s;tom is con&s;tantly ob&s;erved in Crete; they never &s;hut up the hor&s;es when in a &s;weat, but always make a rule of walking them about in the open air. Hence, the Cretan hor&s;es are &s;trong, healthy, and never tire. They boldly clime the &s;teepe&s;t rocks, and de&s;cend the &s;ame into the vallies, without &s;tumbling.</P>
<P>A magnificent repa&s;t was &s;erved up to us. The &s;uperior &s;et before us mo&s;t exqui&s;ite wines, the pro|duce of the hills round the mona&s;tery, on which we be&s;towed the highe&s;t commendation. After &s;upper, we were conducted to a &s;pacious hall, where we per|fectly well enjoyed the plea&s;ures of repo&s;e. To &s;hew re&s;pect to the French con&s;ul, in who&s;e company we were, they had allotted him a &s;eparate apartment, and placed two full decanters by his bed-&s;ide. In the morning he wi&s;hed to wa&s;h his mouth, and pouring
<PB N="149" REF="152">
out &s;ome of the &s;uppo&s;ed water, found it to be white wine. He took the other decanter and filled his gla&s;s, but this proved to be pure brandy. No doubt, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> the&s;e good monks are accu&s;tomed to make libations to the god of &s;leep, or to con&s;ole them&s;elves for his rigours with the bottle.</P>
<P>Canea, anciently Cydonia, the principal re&s;idence of the merchants and factors in the i&s;land of Candia, is well laid out; the principal &s;treet is as &s;trait as a line, and the &s;quares are decorated with fountains. It po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es no remarkable edifices. The greate&s;t part of the hou&s;es have only one &s;tory, and are built with terraces: tho&s;e which are round the harbour, are ornamented with galleries, which afford a mo&s;t charming pro&s;pect. The harbour admits &s;hips of two hundred tons burthen; and if deepened, would afford good anchorage to the large&s;t frigates. It contains, at pre&s;ent, about &s;ixteen thou&s;and inha|bitants.</P>
<P>The Turks who inhabit Candia, are not &s;o implicit|ly &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to the orders of the Grand Signior, as tho&s;e of the other provinces of the empire. They mutually &s;upport each other again&s;t the tyranny of the Pacha, and refu&s;e to bow their necks to the yoke of de&s;poti&s;m. Inrolled as Jani&s;&s;aries at their birth, they compo&s;e the principal &s;oldiery of the i&s;land; and it
<PB N="150" REF="153">
would be dangerous to drive them to revolt. When their governors have been guilty of oppre&s;&s;ion, they have been known to have recour&s;e to arms, and de|mand vengeance. Of this, there was of late years, a very remarkable example; the Pacha of Canea, had a kind of deputy, who, like the re&s;t of tho&s;e in office, made u&s;e of every means to ama&s;s wealth, and drew on him&s;elf the dete&s;tation of the people. The Greeks did not dare to murmur, but the Turks were not &s;o patient; they brought their complaints before the governor, but either becau&s;e he had a real friend&s;hip for him, or was a &s;harer in his plunder, he would not li&s;ten to them; when, on a &s;udden, &s;oon after, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> who was then at Canea, we heard a great tumult in the town. The Jani&s;&s;aries ran through the &s;treets, &s;abre in hand, crying. To arms! And, as in &s;uch circum&s;tances, foreigners are always in danger from a licentious populace; we kept our&s;elves &s;hut up in the con&s;ular hou&s;e, waiting the event.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e of the officer of the Pacha, which was a &s;pacious building lately fini&s;hed, was oppo&s;ite to ours, on the other &s;ide of the harbour. This was pre&s;ently filled with upwards of five hundred per&s;ons, pillaging and de&s;troying every thing that fell in their way. Some tore out the &s;a&s;hes, and threw them upon the quay; others mounted on the terrace, broke down the parapets; while &s;ome were returning loaded
<PB N="151" REF="154">
with furniture. A great number of them were dili|gently &s;earching to di&s;cover the object of public hatred; and in le&s;s than two hours the whole hou&s;e was emptied, and half demoli&s;hed.</P>
<P>An enraged multitude always proceed to exce&s;&s;es, which no one can fore&s;ee. The &s;oldiers took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of a high fort, which commands the town, whence they could thunder on the ca&s;tle of the Pachas, again&s;t which they pointed &s;everal heavy pieces of cannon; and, after leaving a guard at the port, proceeded in a body to demand ju&s;tice, re&s;olv|ing in ca&s;e of refu&s;al, to bury their governor under the ruins of his palace. The whole town followed with dreadful &s;houts, which reaching the ears of the Pacha, who was an old warrior, rendered re&s;pectable by many gallant actions, he had him&s;elf conveyed in an arm-chair into the middle of his court-yard, and when he &s;aw the &s;torm approaching, and that the fu|rious populace were preparing to break down the gates, ordered them in&s;tantly to be thrown open. At the &s;ight of this venerable old man, who had a long white beard, the mutineers were &s;truck &s;ilent, and the mo&s;t daring among them &s;eemed motionle&s;s with a&s;toni&s;hment. At length, none venturing to &s;peak, "Well, my good people", &s;aid the governor, "what do you a&s;k of me"? They all cried out, we mu&s;t have the head of your deputy. "He is fled",
<PB N="152" REF="155">
replied the Pacha; "but if you find him, I abandon him to your vengeance; return to your duty, lay down your arms, and let every man go peaceably home". This firmne&s;s awed even the mo&s;t mutinous, and a rebellion, which might have had fatal con&s;e|quences, was appea&s;ed in an in&s;tant, by the courage and prudence of a &s;ingle man. He had, however, concealed his favourite, and in the night, &s;ent him on board a &s;hip, which immediately &s;et &s;ail for Con|&s;tantinople. After his departure, things returned to their u&s;ual channel, and peace was once more re&s;tored within the walls of Canea.</P>
<P>Quitting Canea, the traveller &s;ees before him the white mountains, at pre&s;ent called the hills of Spha|chia. This chain of eminences is in height &s;econd only to Mount Ida, which is the mo&s;t exten&s;ive in the i&s;land. They form in front of Canea, an im|men&s;e rampart; the &s;ummit of which is lo&s;t in the clouds, and &s;eems to &s;eparate that city from the re&s;t of the i&s;land. The lowe&s;t chain is but two leagues from the town, and may be about &s;ix hundred yards high. Between that and the &s;econd, opens out a va&s;t plain, three leagues in diameter, and of con&s;iderable length; this intermediate chain is far higher than the former. Beyond are lofty peaks; to which, without doubt, the name of the white mountains were given, from their being, during a part of the year, covered
<PB N="153" REF="156">
with &s;now; which collecting in heaps, in the deep vallies on the North-&s;ide, hardens, and never melts: the inhabitants cut it in large pieces, which they bring to Canea, in the night, and thus enjoy the luxury of drinking iced liquors in the hotte&s;t days of &s;ummer.</P>
<P>The&s;e mountains are an appanage granted by the Grand Signior to the Sultana <HI>Valida,</HI> and are en|tirely independent of the government of the Pachas. The Sultana &s;ends a per&s;on &s;he can confide in, to govern them, and collect the tributes. The Greeks, who inhabit them, are called Sphachiots; they rear nu|merous flocks of goats and &s;heep, keep bees, and make excellent chee&s;e, which has the ta&s;te of Parme&s;an.</P>
<P>The Sphachiots confined to their mountains, are more di&s;tinct from the different nations who have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Crete, than the inhabitants of the plains; they &s;peak a dialogue le&s;s corrupt than the re&s;t of of the Candians, and have retained &s;everal cu&s;toms of their ance&s;tors, and certain peculiarities of their ancient character. When <HI>Belon</HI> travelled among them, they were the be&s;t archers in the i&s;land; they had very large bows, and di&s;played more addre&s;s, &s;trength, and courage, than the other Greeks. Even &s;ince the mu&s;quet has &s;ucceeded to the bow, they are
<PB N="154" REF="157">
not le&s;s &s;kilful in the u&s;e of the latter; and in general are excellent mark&s;men.</P>
<P>Of all the Cretans, the Spachiots alone have re|tained the Pyrrhic dance; this they perform, clad in their ancient dre&s;s; that is to &s;ay, a &s;hort robe bound with a girdle, breeches and bu&s;kins; a quiver filled with arrows is fa&s;tened over their &s;houlder; a bent bow hangs on their arm, and by their &s;ides they have a long &s;word. Thus accoutred, they begin the dance, which has three mea&s;ures. The fir&s;t marks the &s;tep, and they change feet in dancing, like the Germans; the movements of the &s;econd are more lively, and re&s;emble the dance of the inhabitants of Lower Brittany, in France; during the third mea|&s;ure, they leap backwards and forwards, fir&s;t on one foot, and then on the other, with great agility. The dancers, who an&s;wer them, imitate the &s;ame &s;teps, and &s;ing and dance with them to the &s;ame tune. In the cour&s;e of this dance, they perform various evo|lutions; &s;ometimes forming a circle; at others, di|viding and ranging them&s;elves in two lines, and &s;eeming to menace each other with their weapons. Afterwards they &s;eparate into couples, and appear as if defying their antagoni&s;ts to the combat; but in all their movements, their ear is true to the mu&s;ic, and they never vary from the mea&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="158">In the ancient Cretan republic, the people were divided into two cla&s;&s;es; that of the youth, and that of mature manhood; this divi&s;ion is &s;till pre&s;erved among the Sphachiots, but not in the purity of the fir&s;t in&s;titution. Formerly the young men were &s;ub|ject to the reproof of the aged, and obeyed them; at pre&s;ent they wi&s;h to command. This want of proper &s;ubordination has been productive of great misfortunes to the whole nation. During the la&s;t war with the Ru&s;&s;ians, the Turks imagined that the inhabitants of Sphachia intended to give up the i&s;land to their enemies, and pretended that &s;ome Ru&s;&s;ian &s;hips, touching at the Southern-&s;ide of the i&s;land, had formed a treaty with the Sphachiots. This was enough to make the Mahometans take up arms. They marched to the number of eight thou&s;and, and climbed, without difficulty, the fir&s;t chain of moun|tains; but it was not &s;o ea&s;y to &s;cale the &s;econd, and a handful could have prevented them. The cla&s;s of men propo&s;ed to fight, and defend their rocks; but the youth, no doubt, &s;educed by the promi&s;es of the Turks, advi&s;ed &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and while their fathers were making head again&s;t the enemy, had the ba&s;e|ne&s;s to introduce them by &s;ecret paths, to the &s;um|mits of their mountains. The moment they appeared, the Sphachiots took to flight, and concealed them|&s;elves as they could, in caverns of the rocks, and among precipices. The Mu&s;&s;ulmen cruelly abu&s;ing
<PB N="156" REF="159">
their victory, de&s;troyed whole villages, ma&s;&s;acred many of the inhabitants, and carried off a great number into &s;lavery, without &s;paring either men, women, or children.</P>
<P>Near Canea is the convent of Acrotiri, a frightful &s;olitude; in the environs of which nothing is &s;een but dreary rocks, and at their feet the wild thyme, briars, thyme with the odoriferous flowers, the laudanum, and a few &s;trawberry-bu&s;hes. The Nuns here are not cloi&s;tered, and make no other vow than that of virginity. Each chu&s;es a companion, and thus coupled, they re&s;ide in &s;mall hou&s;es, built round a chapel, to which a Greek prie&s;t comes to &s;ay ma&s;s. The&s;e couples perform all the mutual offices of friend&s;hip, a&s;&s;i&s;t each other, and po&s;&s;e&s;s in common, an inclo|&s;ure, more or le&s;s con&s;iderable, appropriated to the double cell. This is their garden and orchard, in which we find orange, almond, and olive-trees. They likewi&s;e keep bees, which are not &s;hut up in hives, and have no covering but planks laid cro&s;s-ways on two po&s;ts; beneath which &s;helter, the&s;e indu&s;trious creatures depo&s;it their honey and wax. The fir&s;t combs are the large&s;t, and gradually dimini&s;h to a point. They are all in the &s;hape of an inverted pyramid, and it is &s;urpri&s;ing how fa&s;t they are made by the bees. The honey of the&s;e in&s;ects is pro|duced from the flowers of the different kinds of
<PB N="157" REF="160">
thyme, and an infinity of odoriferous plants and &s;hrubs, with which the country is covered; nor can any honey exceed it in purity, or fragrance.</P>
<P>But to return to our nuns; I have already &s;aid, that, united in pairs, they inhabit a building con&s;i&s;t|ing of three or four apartments. Each of the&s;e little dwellings contains various conveniences within it&s;elf. They have here likewi&s;e a va&s;t ci&s;tern, a nece&s;&s;ary precaution, on an eminence, without water, a wine|pre&s;s, an oven, and one or two looms for making linen. They generally rear &s;ilk-worms, and gather cotton, which is an annual plant in this country. One of the &s;i&s;ters &s;pins, while the other weaves, and &s;ome of them knit &s;tockings. When they have provided them&s;elves with what is nece&s;&s;ary for their own u&s;e, they &s;ell the remaining fruits of their in|du&s;try in the town.</P>
<P>In their cells is neither &s;umptuou&s;ne&s;s nor mag|nificence; we find only convenient uten&s;ils, and ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary furniture, which is kept neat and clean. In a word, the&s;e nuns, without being rich, enjoy a comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, for which they are indebted to their indu&s;try. Chearfulne&s;s is their con&s;tant companion, and we &s;ee among them no me|lancholy faces. In general a younger &s;i&s;ter unites her&s;elf with an elder than her&s;elf, to &s;olace and re|lieve
<PB N="158" REF="161">
her from the burthen of the more laborious employments. I frequently, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> vi&s;ited a Greek lady, who every year pa&s;&s;ed a few weeks in this mona&s;tery, and always found among them vo|luntary nuns; a mildne&s;s, mode&s;ty, and liveline&s;s very remote from that &s;our and au&s;tere character, ab&s;olutely incon&s;i&s;tent with virtue.</P>
<P>At the moment I am writing, adds the above writer, Acrotiri contains within its narrow precincts, the de|crepitude of age, the vigour of riper years, and all the charms of youth. I have &s;een three of the&s;e females well de&s;erving to employ the pencil of a &s;kilful painter: a nun of an hundred and nine years old, another of thirty-&s;ix, and a novice of &s;ixteen. The fir&s;t bent like a bow, with difficulty hobbled along by the aid of a &s;mall &s;taff, and &s;eemed every moment ready to &s;ink with feeblene&s;s. She had &s;till pre&s;erved all her &s;en&s;es, though blunted, and in a kind of &s;tupor. To extract any conver&s;ation from her, &s;he mu&s;t have a a gla&s;s of cordial, or of excellent wine, which gra|dually revived her heart. She told us, &s;he was born in the village of La Sude, which was then in the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Venetians; and recollected the different times that fortre&s;s had been be&s;ieged by the Turks, their throwing the bombs upon the roofs of the hou&s;es, and the terror it &s;pread among the inhabitants. After
<PB N="159" REF="162">
the taking of the fort, &s;he retired to this convent, where &s;he had re&s;ided near fourteen years.</P>
<P>The &s;econd was tall, with an animated countenance, and elegant features; her air was maje&s;tic, her eye-brows black, and her eyes &s;parkling; but the ro&s;es of her cheeks, and the lilies of her complexion began to fade. She was &s;till hand&s;ome, but her beauty was the beauty of maturity; the delicacy and &s;oftne&s;s of blooming youth was evidently pa&s;t, and each &s;ucce&s;|&s;ive day robbed her of a charm.</P>
<P>But the third, to conceive a ju&s;t idea of her beauty, one mu&s;t have &s;een her; the powers of de&s;cription are totally in&s;ufficient to convey it. Unite in ima|gination, all the charms which &s;ometimes adorn the faire&s;t of nature's works, in all their delicacy and perfection, in all their a&s;toni&s;hing harmony and grace, and it will give but a feeble image of the novice of Acrotiri. Her features had uncommon animation, and her eyes &s;parkled with a lu&s;tre that &s;eemed more than human, and which it was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;u&s;tain unmoved. How inde&s;cribable mu&s;t have been her &s;mile, would this beauteous virgin have con&s;ented to &s;mile. Tran&s;cendant as were her charms, her dre&s;s was of the mo&s;t &s;imple kind; yet it &s;eemed as if no ornament might be added, that could embelli&s;h her. Every action, every attitude, made her appearance
<PB N="160" REF="163">
&s;till more lovely. Ab&s;olutely uncon&s;cious of her beauty, &s;he waited with apparent plea&s;ure on the nun, whom &s;he con&s;idered as her mother, and anticipated all her de&s;ires. Her whole air and manner were free from the &s;lighte&s;t tinge of affectation; &s;he appeared ab&s;orbed in &s;ublime ideas, and only a&s;pired to be re|ceived among the nuns of Acrotiri. I cannot deny, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> that I was &s;en&s;ibly concerned, at the thought of &s;o many charms being for ever buried in the depth of a &s;ad &s;olitude; and that &s;he, who &s;eemed born to give the highe&s;t felicity to &s;ome favoured mortal, &s;hould be &s;eparated for ever from the &s;ociety of man.</P>
<P>Let a painter try what his art can effect, and if he would repre&s;ent the bloom of youth, the maturity of riper years, and old age in her decrepitudes, let him pourtray the three females I have endeavoured to de&s;cribe. But he will fail in the attempt. To &s;ucceed, he mu&s;t, like me, have &s;een the originals. The imagination only traces with fidelity what the eye has ob&s;erved. Then genius meditates and compo&s;es, and by its powers, become creative; for perfectly to repre&s;ent &s;uch objects, is rather to create than to imi|tate. This was the perfection to which <HI>Protogenes</HI> attained. The froth on the mouth of the panting dog, appeared to him imitated and not natural. An ordinary arti&s;t would have been &s;atisfied, but the
<PB N="161" REF="164">
Rhodian painter a&s;pired to the perfection of nature; that is, to be like her Creator.</P>
<P>Rhetimo, anciently Rhitymna, the third chief city of the i&s;land, and re&s;idence of a Pacha; is a hand|&s;ome town &s;ituated on the entrance of a rich and fertile plain. It is not large, and &s;carcely contains &s;ix thou&s;and inhabitants. A citadel built on a rock, which projects into the &s;ea, would be &s;ufficient for its defence, were it not commanded by a high hill, from which, it may be battered with artillery. The har|bour, which is nearly choaked up, is only capable of receiving barks and &s;mall ve&s;&s;els. The Turks never trouble them&s;elves to prevent, or repair, the ravages of time, and behold with unconcern, the mo&s;t u&s;eful works become heaps of ruins. Their harbours, there|fore, are every where filling up, and the commerce they attracted de&s;erts them, to &s;eek more commo|dious &s;ituations. The French had formerly a vice-con&s;ul at Rhetimo, to which place the &s;hips of Mar|&s;eilles came to take in oil; but, for a long time pa&s;t, they have not been able to approach the town, and the government have withdrawn an officer, that can now be of no u&s;e.</P>
<P>It is, neverthele&s;s, much to be wi&s;hed, that the port of Rhetimo may be re&s;tored. The plains round it, abound in various productions, and oils, cotton,
<PB N="162" REF="165">
&s;affron, and wax, are extremely plentiful; all which dif|ferent branches of commerce would become &s;till more exten&s;ive, could the inhabitants convey their produce to a foreign market. Their gardens produce the be&s;t fruit in the i&s;land. Their pomegranates, almonds, pi&s;tachio nuts, and oranges, are excellent. Here we find the apricot-tree, that produces the <HI>mich-mich;</HI> a fruit of an exqui&s;ite fragrance, and yielding a delicious juice. It is a kind of alberge, but more mellow, and &s;maller than that of France.</P>

<P>FIVE leagues from this town, an immen&s;e country opens, between the we&s;tern extremity and Mount Ida, and the fir&s;t chain of the white moun|tains. In this large valley is the village of Mar|guerites, the mo&s;t populous of any in the i&s;land, which contains about ten thou&s;and Greeks, who cul|tivate the rich adjoining plains, and would carry their oils, grain, and other commodities to Rhetimo, if
<PB N="163" REF="166">
they had a harbour. This village, or rather town, is but two leagues di&s;tant from the northern &s;ea, and not far from the road to Candia. Clo&s;e to it flows a &s;mall river, which falls from the mountains in ca&s;|cades. The charming temperature, and varied pro|ductions of this beautiful country, invited the Vene|tians to &s;ettle there. They had built country-hou&s;es in this di&s;trict, where they pa&s;&s;ed a part of the year; &s;everal of which are &s;till to be &s;een; but it is with regret we find them occupied by ignorant Greeks, or barbarous Turks. Nothing remains but the ruins of tho&s;e gardens which art de&s;igned, and nature delighted in decorating with a perpetual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of flowers and fruits.</P>
<P>The Turks in this i&s;land, do not re&s;erve in their hou&s;es, &s;eparate apartments for every per&s;on of the family; the women only have di&s;tinct chambers; the men &s;leep together in &s;pacious halls, on matra&s;&s;es &s;pread on the carpeting, and provided with &s;heets and a blanket. Agreeable to this ancient cu&s;tom, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> in his travels through the i&s;land, we were &s;hewn into a large room, round which our beds were placed on the ground. Only two centuries ago, &s;ays the above author, it was u&s;ual even in France, for the whole family to pa&s;s the night in the &s;ame apartment; &s;ince that time, our manners have undergone a great change; they have infinitely more delicacy and con|venience;
<PB N="164" REF="167">
nay, perhaps more decency; but are they more &s;ocial?</P>
<P>De&s;cribing his reception, and an entertainment at a country-hou&s;e of a Turki&s;h nobleman, our author adds, the table was &s;pread in the garden under the &s;hade of orange-trees. Six of the&s;e beautiful trees, planted in a circle, united their branches, which had never been mutilated by the &s;hears, and formed over our heads a roof impenetrable to the rays of the &s;un. In the middle of a very hot day, we enjoyed in this arbour, which nature has &s;o profu&s;ely embelli&s;hed, a delicious coolne&s;s. On every &s;ide, flowers hung in garlands over the gue&s;ts, and formed a crown for each. The brightne&s;s of their colours, their exqui|&s;ite odours, the beauty of the foliage gently agitated by the zephyrs; every thing con&s;pired to make us imagine our&s;elves &s;uddenly tran&s;ported to &s;ome en|chanted grove. To complete the whole, a beautiful &s;tream which de&s;cended from the adjoining hills, pa&s;&s;ed under the table, and contributed to pre&s;erve the plea&s;antne&s;s and coolne&s;s of our arbour; on each &s;ide of us, we beheld it gliding over a golden &s;and, and winding its cry&s;tal &s;tream through the garden, in which a great number of &s;mall canals had been dug, to convey its water to the orange, the pomegranate, and almond-trees; which repaid, with intere&s;t, the moi&s;ture they received in flowers and in fruits.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="168">The table was now &s;erved; the Aga had en|deavoured to provide for us &s;uitable to our ta&s;te; we were pre&s;ented with all the uten&s;ils common in France; and our ho&s;t him&s;elf conformed to our cu&s;|toms. Knowing that we were u&s;ed to take &s;oup, he &s;upplied us with a great di&s;h of roa&s;t-meats, covered with a delicious jelly. Round this were bartavelles, almo&s;t as large as our hen; there were, be&s;ides, ex|cellent quails, a roa&s;ted lamb, and ha&s;hed meat dre&s;&s;ed with rice, perfectly well &s;ea&s;oned. The wine cor|re&s;ponded with the excellence of the re&s;t of our en|tertainment; we were &s;erved with <HI>vin de loi,</HI> malm|&s;ey of Mount Ida, and a &s;ort of perfumed red wine, equally agreeable to the &s;mell and the ta&s;te. The <HI>vin de loi</HI> is rather bitter, but leaves an agreeable flavour in the mouth, and excites a gentle warmth in the &s;tomach. The malm&s;ey of Mount Ida is more unctuous, more agreeable to the palate, and not le&s;s fragrant.</P>
<P>Our good patriarch, wi&s;hing to imitate his gue&s;ts, and take his gla&s;s in defiance of the prophet, had &s;ent away his &s;ervants and his children. Laying a&s;ide the Turki&s;h gravity which never conde&s;cends to &s;mile; he chatted with much vivacity, and frequently a&s;to|ni&s;hed us by the penetration of his under&s;tanding, the aptne&s;s of his replies, and the ju&s;tne&s;s of his ideas. When the di&s;hes were removed, we were pre&s;ented
<PB N="166" REF="169">
with Moka coffee and pipes. The pipes made u&s;e of here, are of ja&s;mine, and the part applied to the mouth of amber; their enormous length entirely takes away the pungency of the tobacco, which, in Turkey, how|ever, is mild; and, being mixed with the wood of aloes, produce a vapour neither di&s;agreeable nor in|commodious, as in other countries.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the great heat was over, he called his &s;ons, and ordered them to attend us on a &s;hooting party; we de&s;cended into a plain, where we found plenty of quails, and had the plea&s;ure of killing many without fatigue. The darkne&s;s which now advanced over the hills, brought us back to the hou&s;e, and as the nights in this climate are as clear and fine as the days are beautiful, we &s;upped in the arbour of orange-trees. Rarely do we enjoy this luxury in France; the night air has always a degree of chillne&s;s that makes us &s;hudder; or a copious dew falls injurious to health. In Crete, the&s;e inconveniences are not felt. The &s;ky was without a cloud, the coolne&s;s agreeable, and the air &s;o calm, as &s;carcely to di&s;turb the light of four large wax tapers, which illumined the foliage in a thou&s;and different ways, and the varied productions of which, produced lights and &s;hades of an admirable effect. The conden&s;ation of the air had collected the fragrant perfumes of the flower and &s;hrubs, and every &s;en&s;e was delighted.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="170">This Turki&s;h nobleman po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;everal other country hou&s;es. That to which we were invited, he only occupied in the &s;pring; for he pa&s;&s;es the violent heat of the &s;ummer in a charming retreat, &s;ituated among the mountains. Then, while the &s;un &s;corches up the plain, and the whole atmo&s;phere &s;eems on fire, he enjoys a delicious temperature; and beholds the country round him clad in verdure, and covered with fruits and flowers.</P>
<P>During the whole time we pa&s;&s;ed at his &s;eat, we ex|perienced from him nothing but the utmo&s;t politene&s;s; he made us no great compliments, but &s;tudied our ta&s;tes; and we were &s;ure of finding on our table, the di&s;hes to which we &s;eemed to give a preference. One morning ri&s;ing before my companions, and walking among the neighbouring orchards, I perceived this ve|nerable Mu&s;&s;ulman &s;tanding near a fountain contiguous to the hou&s;e; he was wa&s;hing his face and hands, and chaunting the fir&s;t chapter of the koran, that is to &s;ay, one of the fine&s;t hymns ever addre&s;&s;ed by man to the &s;upreme Being. He &s;eemed infinitely ab&s;orbed in the adoration he was paying to his Creator; and I conceived, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> a favourable opinion of a man, who fulfilled with &s;o much dignity, the fir&s;t of all duties.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="171">Such is the life led by the rich Mahometans, in Candia; they pa&s;s three-fourths of the year on their e&s;tates, and repair in winter to the town, to &s;ell the &s;uperfluity of their produce, which procures them very con&s;iderable wealth. Content with their po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions, they a&s;pire after none of the public employ|ments which might endanger their &s;afety; but &s;ee them without envy in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;trangers. Uncontrolled monarchs on their own e&s;tates, they command and receive implicit obedience. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the hand&s;ome&s;t women in the i&s;land, they bring up their numerous offspring in the re&s;pect and &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion due to the chief of the family. The&s;e Mahome|tans, enjoying without pain, anxiety, or ambition, all the bounties offered them by nature, pa&s;s their days in tranquility and happine&s;s; and retain, even in a very advanced age, almo&s;t unimpaired good health.</P>
<P>The Greeks, notwith&s;tanding the contemptible &s;tate of deba&s;ement to which they are reduced, &s;till retain a pride and vanity, that can only be equalled by their ignorance. Of this we had a &s;triking in&s;tance, at the convent of A&s;omatos; in the mountains bordering on Mount Ida, where we halted one evening, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> in our journey through Crete; the &s;uperiors of which, thinking to amu&s;e us, propo&s;ed after &s;upper, that his prie&s;ts &s;hould chaunt the <HI>Kyrie elei&s;on.</HI> We accepted his propo&s;al; and immediately a number of children,
<PB N="169" REF="172">
deacons, and &s;ub-deacons, made their appearance; and, on a &s;ignal given, began the <HI>Kyrie elei&s;on.</HI> They &s;ang through their no&s;es, and produced &s;o frightful a noi&s;e, that it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty we could refrain from laughing; but, at length, they concluded their di&s;cordant jargon, and we clapped our hands in applau&s;e. We were now in hopes this entertainment was ended, but he begged us to go through the &s;ame ceremony in French. On this, a young man in our company &s;truck up a lively &s;ong, and we all joined chorus. The &s;uperior and his brethren, were delighted with the &s;prightline&s;s of our <HI>Kyrie elei&s;on,</HI> but affirmed, their mu&s;ic was more &s;olemn and maje&s;tic; to which we readily &s;ub&s;cribed. The&s;e incidents, &s;ays our author, &s;eem trivial; but nothing can better de&s;cribe the character of the people we vi&s;it. The good cheer, choice wines, and excellent beds we met with, were entirely owing to a little well-timed complai&s;ance, and the incen&s;e offered to the vanity of our ho&s;t.</P>
<P>The next morning we intended to have breakfa&s;ted at Arcadi, the hand&s;ome&s;t mona&s;tery in the i&s;land; and, as it was only three leagues di&s;tant, we expected to reach it in good time; but the roads were dreadful. We continued a&s;cending, for an hour and an half, before we came to the fir&s;t chain of heights, that run parallel with mount Ida, and on which Arcadi is built. We met with &s;teep paths, cut out of the
<PB N="170" REF="173">
rock; and our hor&s;es were obliged to clamber up &s;teps of marble and granite, without &s;lipping, or &s;tumbling, otherwi&s;e we mu&s;t have been da&s;hed to pieces on the &s;tones, or tumbled headlong into the torrent. I do not exaggerate, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> the horror of the roads we had to pa&s;s. The fir&s;t time a man unaccu&s;tomed to &s;uch ways travels into Crete, he imagines his life in danger at every &s;tep, but more experience &s;oon relieves him from his fears: for there is no place &s;o dangerous and dreadful, but may ea&s;ily be pa&s;&s;ed with the mules and hor&s;es of the country.</P>
<P>We were repaid for our fatigues, by the beauty of the pro&s;pects which every where pre&s;ented them|&s;elves to our view. We traver&s;ed whole woods of &s;trawberries and privets, which never lo&s;e their ver|dure. Firs, of a prodigious height, rear their heads amid the &s;nows, and are the haunts of herds of wild goats. In the vallies the cour&s;e of the waters is traced by tufts of myrtle, &s;ome branches of which were in flower, and mingled the verdant lu&s;tre of their foliage with that of the laurel-ro&s;e. The &s;heep were feeding on the brow of the rocks; and the cot|tages, &s;urrounded with clumps of trees, formed land&s;capes, the eye was never wearied with admiring. Sometimes the&s;e pro&s;pects were &s;ufficiently near to di&s;criminate every object; and at others, di&s;tant and
<PB N="171" REF="174">
ob&s;cure, pre&s;ented only light &s;hades, plea&s;ingly &s;ketched in the horizon.</P>
<P>After a fatiguing journey of three hours, we ar|rived at the convent of Arcadi; where the &s;uperior received us politely, and ordered breakfa&s;t to be prepared. This mona&s;tery, &s;ituated in mount Ida, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es very exten&s;ive tracts of land, which are care|fully cultivated by its numerous monks; and the oil, corn, wine and wax, produced on them every year, amounts in value, to con&s;iderable &s;ums. The good fathers live much at their ea&s;e, and are very ho&s;|pitable to travellers.</P>
<P>The apartments of this mona&s;tery are built round a large court, in which is a hand&s;ome church, whi|ther the Greeks of the neighbourhood repair to di|vine &s;ervice. Among this numerous body of monks, there are but few prie&s;ts; (the greater part of them do not enter into holy orders) but &s;ome in quality of brethren, and are employed in the mo&s;t fatiguing labours of agriculture. We vi&s;ited the cellar, in which a former traveller <HI>(Tournfort)</HI> reckoned a hun|dred ca&s;ks of wine; but we &s;aw only forty barrels full; the&s;e, however, were of a &s;tupendous bigne&s;s. Into this cellar the &s;uperior de&s;cends at the end of every vintage; and the following is the very &s;ingular form of his benediction on the wine. "O Lord God,
<PB N="172" REF="175">
who love&s;t men, look down on this wine, and on tho&s;e that &s;hall drink it. Ble&s;s our ca&s;ks, as thou did&s;t ble&s;s the well of Jacob, the pool of Siloam, and the drink of thy holy apo&s;tles. O Lord, who did&s;t con|de&s;cend to be pre&s;ent at the wedding of Cana, where by changing of water into wine, there manife&s;ted thy glory to thy di&s;ciples, &s;end now thy holy &s;pirit on this wine, and ble&s;s it in thy name. Amen."</P>
<P>After a plentiful breakfa&s;t, we de&s;ired to &s;ee the library of the convent, of which we had heard &s;o much from the good monks. It was, as they &s;aid, the mo&s;t valuable, numerous, and complete in the i&s;land; we expected therefore to have found &s;ome literary trea&s;ures; or, at lea&s;t, the be&s;t authors of ancient Greece. They conducted us into an apartment, where we &s;aw about two hundred old volumes, ranged on &s;helves, and covered with du&s;t, which did not &s;eem to have had the honour of a vi&s;it for many a day. They con&s;i&s;ted in general of books of devo|tion, &s;ermons, and controver&s;ial divinity. After turning over a great number, without finding any thing that merited our attention, except a manu&s;cript <HI>Homer,</HI> which they would not &s;ell, we went to re|turn our thanks to the &s;uperior, and continued our journey.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="176">In our way to the&s;e convents, we travelled along the &s;ides of the hills, which terminate mount Ida, to the Southward. Two chains of the&s;e hills, formed between us and that mountain, a double amphitheatre, above which it reared its maje&s;tic head. We could perceive large clouds of a &s;hining whitene&s;s, ranging them&s;elves around its &s;ummit, and circling it with a &s;ilver crown; which, illumined by the &s;un, &s;hone with a wonderful &s;plendor. The&s;e clouds, obeying the law of attraction, after encompa&s;&s;ing for &s;everal hours the head of the mountain, fell in imperceptible drops on all the &s;urrounding objects, and entirely di&s;ap|peared; others &s;ucceeded, and were di&s;&s;ipated in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>This attractive power, which forces the clouds to|wards the tops of the lofty mountains, is the origin of &s;prings, fountains, &s;treams, and all the rivers of the globe. In the higher regions of the air, where the ri&s;ing vapours are conden&s;ed by cold, the water of the clouds is converted into hail and &s;now; but, if they attain only a moderate height, when the cold is not very great, they fall in mi&s;ts, rains, and copious dews. When the hills are covered with fruits, the &s;prings and rivulets become more numerous, as the leaves of trees po&s;&s;e&s;s the peculiar property of attract|ing the humidity diffu&s;ed throughout the atmo&s;phere. To procure water for a dry country, nothing more,
<PB N="174" REF="177">
therefore, would be nece&s;&s;ary, than to plant fruit-trees on the hill-tops. When we find the ancients be&s;towing, the name of rivers on the Glaucus and the Zanthus, which run through A&s;ia-Minor, and are now little more than incon&s;iderable brooks, we are tempted to &s;u&s;pect them of exaggeration. But, if we reflect, that the hills where the&s;e rivers ri&s;e, are, at pre&s;ent, &s;tript of their trees and &s;oil, and no longer oppo&s;e a barrier to the pa&s;&s;age of the clouds, though formerly crowned with lofty fore&s;ts, which attracted them around their tops, and drew from them all their moi&s;|ture; we &s;hall find no difficulty in believing, that they, as well as many others, at pre&s;ent, but in&s;igni|ficant rivulets, might anciently, when fed with more copious &s;upplies, well de&s;erve the appellation of rivers.</P>
<P>The diver&s;ity of land&s;capes, which con&s;tantly charmed the eye, made us forget the dangers to which we were expo&s;ed. For the &s;pace of a league, we rode along the &s;lope of a very high hill. On one &s;ide, the ground was as perpendicular as a wall; and on the other, was the channel of a torrent, two hun|dred feet deep, through which the water ru&s;hed over the large flint &s;tones, with a violent noi&s;e. The path at la&s;t grew &s;o narrow, that when once fairly entered, it was impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;mount, but at the ri&s;k of throwing both our&s;elves and the hor&s;es into the aby&s;s
<PB N="175" REF="178">
below. In many places, this road was not more than a foot and a half wide; though on the brink of a tre|mendous precipice, which no one could look down without &s;huddering. We were now convinced of the excellence of our hor&s;es; not one of which &s;o much as made a fal&s;e &s;tep. They &s;eemed to feel the danger, trod with caution, and examined where to put their feet. In a wet place, however, mine made a fal&s;e &s;lip, and tottered for a moment on the brink of a pre|cipice; but keeping my &s;eat &s;till firm, he recovered him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mount Ida begins near Candia, and &s;tretches from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, as far as the White Mountains. It ex|tends from the Northern to the Southern Sea, and is the highe&s;t in the i&s;land. In many parts of it, &s;now lies all the year. From its &s;ummit, we may di&s;cover the &s;ea of Crete, and that of Lybia. The eye wanders over an immen&s;e horizon, and di&s;cerns many of the &s;cattered i&s;lands of the Archipelago; &s;uch as Cytherea, Milo and Argentum.</P>
<P>In &s;ummer when the &s;nows are melted, va&s;t plains, &s;ituated on the declivity of the mountains, afford ex|cellent pa&s;turage for the flocks. On that part of it, oppo&s;ite to Candia, are fore&s;ts, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of maple and green oak. The Southern &s;ides abound with the &s;trawberry-tree, privets, and rock-ro&s;es. The Ea&s;tern
<PB N="176" REF="179">
brow is beautified with cedars, pines, and cypre&s;&s;es; but on the We&s;t, its perpendicular &s;ides pre&s;ent nothing but piles of rocks inacce&s;&s;ible to &s;cale. It is enriched with an infinity of other plants, which would delight the botani&s;t; &s;uch as the true melliot, the yellow flowered marjoram, &amp;c. Abundant &s;treams flow on every &s;ide from its &s;ummit. Some ru&s;h in torrents into the vallies, while others water the plains, which produce luxuriant harve&s;ts; or, di&s;tri|buted by art, maintain fecundity in the innumerable fruit-trees which go round the villages.</P>
<P>The labyrinth, as it is called, runs under a moun|tain at the foot of Mount Ida. The opening of it is natural, and not wide. We had brought with us, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> the thread of Ariadne, that is four hun|dred fathoms of twine, to explore it. To di&s;cern our way amid this gloomy abode, we each carried a flambeau. Two Greeks bore the clew, which they unfolded or wound up as occa&s;ion required. At fir&s;t, we lo&s;t our&s;elves in different allies without an open|ing; but, at length di&s;covered the true pa&s;&s;age, which is on the right as we enter. We arrive at it by a nar|row path, and are obliged to creep on our hands and feet, for the &s;pace of an hundred yards, the roof being extremely low. At the end of this narrow pa&s;&s;age, the ceiling ri&s;es &s;uddenly, and we were able to walk upright, in the mid&s;t of the impenetrable darkne&s;s
<PB N="177" REF="180">
that &s;urrounded us, and the innumerable ways which &s;truck off on each &s;ide, and cro&s;&s;ed each other in dif|ferent directions Sometimes we were &s;topped &s;hort by a pa&s;&s;age without an opening; and at others, after long circuits, were a&s;toni&s;hed to find our&s;elves at the cro&s;s-way from which we had &s;et out. Frequently, after encircling with our cord a great extent of rock, we were obliged to wind it up, and return the way we came. It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe to what a degree the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages are multiplied and crooked; &s;ome of them form curves, which lead in&s;en&s;ibly to a va&s;t empty &s;pace, &s;upported by enormous pillars, whence three or four pa&s;&s;ages &s;trike off, that conduct to op|po&s;ite points; others, after long windings, divide into &s;everal branches: the&s;e again, extend a great length; and, terminated by the rock, oblige the traveller to trace back his way. We walked with precaution in the doublings of this va&s;t labyrinth, amid the eternal darkne&s;s that reigns through it, and which our torches could hardly di&s;pel. The precaution we had taken, of proceeding with the thread of Ariadne, and of fa&s;tening it at different di&s;tances, le&s;t it &s;hould break, allowed us to advance further than <HI>Belon, Tournfort,</HI> and <HI>Pocock.</HI> We ob&s;erved, in &s;everal parts of the middle avenue, the cyphers 1700, written with a black pencil, by the hand of the celebrated botani&s;t. An extraordinary circum&s;tance, which he remarks, and which we admired no le&s;s than he had done, is the
<PB N="178" REF="181">
property po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the rock, of pre&s;enting the names engraved on it in relief.</P>
<P>After &s;traying for a long time, in the fruitful ca|vern of Minotaur, we arrived at the extremity of the alley, which <HI>Tournfort</HI> followed. There we found a wide &s;pace, with cyphers cut in the rock, none of which were of an earlier date than the fourteenth century. There is another, &s;imilar to this, on the right. To arrive at this place, we had run out almo&s;t all our line, that is to &s;ay, about twenty-four hun|dred feet, without reckoning our various excur&s;ions. We remained three hours in the labyrinth, conti|nually walking, without being able to flatter our|&s;elves with having &s;een every thing.</P>
<P>Several authors, among whom are <HI>Belon</HI> and <HI>Pocock,</HI> pretend, that this labyrinth is no more than a quarry; from which, &s;tones were brought to build the city of Gortyna, &s;ituated at many miles di&s;tance; the mag|nificent ruins of which, are &s;till vi&s;ible. Mr. <HI>Tourn|fort</HI> has &s;atisfactorily confuted this opinion; he has proved, that the &s;tone of this cavern is too &s;oft to be fit for building; and that it would have co&s;t immen&s;e &s;ums to convey it acro&s;s the &s;teep mountains, that lie between the labyrinth and that city. It might have been much more natural for the inhabitants, to pro|cure their &s;tone from the mountains, in the vicinity of
<PB N="179" REF="182">
Gortyna. It is much more probable, adds Mr. <HI>Tournfort,</HI> that nature produced the labyrinth, and that the pa&s;&s;age at the entrance, has not been altered, to &s;hew po&s;terity what was the &s;tate of the&s;e &s;ubter|raneous channels, before they were enlarged by the hand of man.</P>
<P>But for what purpo&s;e, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> was this laby|rinth intended? And was it there that the Minotaur was confined? The di&s;covery of truth, ob&s;cured by the lap&s;e of time, gives plea&s;ure to the reader, and amply recompen&s;es the labour of inve&s;tigation.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, it is certain that this immen&s;e cavern is not the labyrinth formed by <HI>Daedalus,</HI> on the plan of that of Egypt. All the ancient writers atte&s;t, that the famous work of that celebrated archi|tect, was &s;ituated at Cno&s;&s;us. <HI>John Tzetzes,</HI> very &s;atisfactorily de&s;cribes this famous edifice, and in|forms us of the u&s;e for which it was intended. <HI>"Daedalus,</HI> the Athenian, made for King <HI>Minos,</HI> a pri&s;on, from which it was impo&s;&s;ible to e&s;cape. Its numerous windings, were in the form of a &s;nail, and it was called the labyrinth." This labyrinth &s;ub&s;i&s;ts no longer. It was, indeed, already de&s;troyed, in the days of <HI>Pliny.</HI> An antique gem, corre&s;ponding with this de&s;cription of <HI>Tzetzes,</HI> is &s;till to be &s;een.
<PB N="180" REF="183">
Let us proceed to examine that which is &s;till exi&s;t|ing.</P>
<P><HI>Taurus,</HI> was the name of one of the principal men of Crete; who, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the advantage of a fine per&s;on, and having acquired great renown by his military exploits, <HI>Pa&s;iphiae,</HI> wife of <HI>Minos,</HI> king of Crete, became enamoured of him, and had a &s;on by him: upon di&s;covering that tran&s;action, <HI>Minos</HI> would not, however, put him to death; but, according to ancient hi&s;tory, confined him to the mountains to &s;erve the &s;hepherds. In the&s;e &s;olitary abodes, he grew wild and fierce, and lived by robbery, and &s;teal|ing &s;heep from the flocks. Having learnt, that <HI>Minos</HI> had &s;ent &s;oldiers to take him, he dug a deep cavern, which he made his place of refuge. At length, the king of Crete &s;ent him &s;uch criminals, as he wi&s;hed to puni&s;h with death. His ferocity, and this employ|ment, no doubt, procured him the name of <HI>Minotaur,</HI> and induced poets and painters to repre&s;ent him as a mon&s;ter, half a man, and half a bull. An ingenious emblem, having reference to his birth, character, and odious &s;ervices.</P>
<P><HI>The&s;eus</HI> arriving in the i&s;land of Crete, &s;ays <HI>Plutarch, Ariadne</HI> fell de&s;perately in love with him. She bore him a &s;on, and taught him how to e&s;cape from the winding pa&s;&s;ages of the labyrinth; and he &s;lew the
<PB N="181" REF="184">
<HI>Minatour.</HI> To di&s;tingui&s;h this cavern, from the fa|mous edifice built by <HI>Daedalus,</HI> at Cno&s;&s;us, <HI>Claudian</HI> called it the labyrinth of Gortyna, the u&s;ual abode of the <HI>Minotaur.</HI> Of the labyrinth of Cno&s;&s;us, <HI>Claudian</HI> &s;ays, "it forms different circuits, which are neither inferior to the art, with which the labyrinth of Gor|tyna, the u&s;ual abode of the <HI>Minotaur</HI> is built, nor the windings of the river Maeander."</P>
<P>We have now thrown all the light we have been able upon this wonderful cavern of antiquity, and &s;hall leave our readers to form their conjectures; only begging leave to remark, that it &s;eems to us &s;ingu|lar, that the antique gem of the labyrinth of Cno&s;&s;us, &s;hould have the figure of a Minotaur in the centre.</P>
<P>The origin of Gortyna is uncertain; the opinions of authors varying on this &s;ubject. It is, however, of the &s;lighte&s;t antiquity. <HI>Homer</HI> &s;peaks of it, as of a powerful city defended by walls. It was a flouri&s;hing city when <HI>Lycurgus</HI> travelled into Crete. <HI>Plato</HI> tells us, it was built by a colony from Gortyna, a city of Peloponne&s;us. The Lethe, this river &s;o celebrated in antiquity, ran near Gortyna. It was called Lethe, becau&s;e <HI>Harmonia,</HI> the daughter of <HI>Venus,</HI> forgot her hu&s;band <HI>Cadmus,</HI> on its banks.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="185">The ruins of Gortyna, cover a va&s;t extent of ground, and enable us to form &s;ome idea of its an|cient magnificence. Such of its monuments, as &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t, are not of the highe&s;t antiquity. One of the mo&s;t remarkable, is a gate built with large bricks, which have been formerly covered with free &s;tone. This edifice is of a con&s;iderable thickne&s;s, and pre&s;ents an exten&s;ive front. It cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, more ancient than the time, when <HI>Ptolemy Philopater,</HI> un|dertook to rebuild the walls of Gortyna. Beyond this gate, we find a large open &s;pace, in form nearly of a parallelogram, on each &s;ide of which, is a double row of pede&s;tals. The ba&s;es of the marble are buried, and the tops appear above the ground. The order in which they are ranged, gives rea&s;on to conjecture, they were part of the portico of a temple. At dif|ferent intervals, we meet with heaps of rubbi&s;h, and columns of marble and granite, buried up to the middle of their &s;hafts. The capitals lie near them, broken off, but &s;everal of them have none. Near the farther end of the&s;e ruins, on the banks of that beau|tiful river, where <HI>Harmonia</HI> forgot <HI>Cadmus,</HI> we enter a church, one &s;ide of which is de&s;troyed. This is probably the ancient cathedral founded by <HI>Titus,</HI> the di&s;ciple of <HI>St. Paul.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e ruins do not appear &s;uitable to what might be expected, from the grandeur and magnificence of
<PB N="183" REF="186">
Gortyna. But we mu&s;t con&s;ider, that the fine&s;t mar|bles have been carried off; that we &s;ee, in adjacent villages, ancient columns employed in making gates for the Turki&s;h gardens, and that the greate&s;t part of its ornaments are buried under the earth, which is con&s;iderably rai&s;ed. If the ground were dug into, and proper re&s;earches made, we &s;hould certainly find &s;tatues and valuable antiquities. At pre&s;ent the hu&s;bandman pa&s;&s;es his plough over them, and covers with his harve&s;t, the ruins of the palaces and temples of Gortyna. Such is the de&s;tiny of ancient cities. They are the work of man, and peri&s;h like him&s;elf. Tho&s;e which in ages pa&s;t were the ornament or terror of the world, Thebes, Memphis, and Babylon, are now no more. Can we imagine, that London, that noble city, which contains within it&s;elf all the arts, and innumerable inhabitants, will exi&s;t for ever. Can we doubt, that the curious traveller &s;hall one day wander amid heaps of rubbi&s;h, in &s;earch of the &s;ituation of her temples, and her palaces? Let us con&s;ole our&s;elves: that period is &s;till very re|mote.</P>
<P>This i&s;land is governed by three Pachas, who re&s;ide at Candia, Canea, and Rhetimo. The fir&s;t, who is always a Pacha of three tails, is, as it were, the viceroy of the i&s;land. He is inve&s;ted with the &s;u|preme power, has the in&s;pection of the forts and
<PB N="184" REF="187">
ar&s;enals, nominates to vacant military po&s;ts, and to the governments of La Sude, Grabu&s;a, Spina Longua, and Gira Petra. The governors of the&s;e forts are called beys. They have under them a governor of the ca&s;tle, and three general officers; one of whom is general of the artillery, the other of the cavalry, and the third of the Jani&s;&s;aries. The council of the Pacha con&s;i&s;ts of a <HI>Kyaia,</HI> who has great influence in all public affairs, and likewi&s;e of the principal officers of the army in the di&s;trict.</P>
<P>The great officers of the law are the Muphti, the &s;upreme head of religion, and the Cadi. The for|mer expounds the law, relative to the partition of property among children, inheritances, and mar|riages; in a word, all tho&s;e laid down by <HI>Mahomet,</HI> in the Koran; and decides on every thing re&s;pect|ing the Mahometan religion. The Cadi cannot pa&s;s &s;entence in di&s;putes originating in the&s;e laws, until he has obtained in writing, the opinion of the Muphti. His office therefore is to receive declarations, com|plaints, the pre&s;ents of individuals, and to decide in the common ca&s;es of litigation. The Pacha mu&s;t con&s;ult the&s;e per&s;ons, before he can legally put a Turk to death; but when he has attained the dignity of three-tails, he often rai&s;es him&s;elf above the laws, and at once dictates the &s;entence of death, and orders it to be carried into execution by his own authority.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="188">Each mo&s;que has its Imam, a &s;ort of curate, who performs divine &s;ervice; and &s;chool-ma&s;ters are di&s;|tributed in different quarters of the town. The&s;e men are generally re&s;pected in Turkey, and bear the title of Effendi, a title of honour be&s;towed on per&s;ons con&s;idered as de&s;erving re&s;pect.</P>
<P>The garri&s;on of Candia con&s;i&s;ts of forty-&s;ix com|panies, compo&s;ing an army of about ten thou&s;and men. All the&s;e troops are not in the town, but would be collected in an in&s;tant. They receive their pay regularly, and punctually, every three months; except the Jani&s;&s;aries, who&s;e officers alone are paid. The different appointments of officers in this militia, do not depend on the Pacha. All promotions are regulated by a council of each company, con&s;i&s;ting of the officers on duty, and the veterans. The&s;e po&s;ts can only be held two years; except that of captain, which is purcha&s;ed at Con&s;tantinople, and held for life. The <HI>Ou&s;ta,</HI> or cook, is continued likewi&s;e in his employment, as long as the company are contented with his &s;ervices. There is a chaplain, or Iman, to every company.</P>
<P>The garri&s;ons of Canea, and Rhetimo, regulated on the &s;ame plan, are much le&s;s numerous. The fir&s;t con&s;i&s;ts of about three thou&s;and men, the other of fifteen hundred. But as all the male children of
<PB N="186" REF="189">
the Turks become members of the corps of Ja|ni&s;&s;aries, at their birth, this number would greatly augment in time of war. There is not much indeed to fear from them, the greete&s;t part having &s;carcely ever &s;een a mu&s;quet fired. They are never exer|ci&s;ed in military evolutions, and are totally ignorant of that dreadful art, which in our days has been brought to &s;uch perfection; and which, reduced to certain rules, triumphs without difficulty over blind force and numbers.</P>
<P>A Pacha, of Canea, who di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the la&s;t war with the Ru&s;&s;ians, was de&s;irous to try the &s;kill of the gunners of that garri&s;on. He ordered a bark to be anchored, at the di&s;tance of half a mile from the walls, and a large barrel placed on the deck. The &s;ea was perfectly calm, and the mark exceedingly di&s;tinct, but notwith&s;tanding a reward was offered to the per&s;on who &s;hould knock it down, the gunners kept firing the whole day, without touching either the barrel or the bark.</P>
<P>The Pachas of Canea, and Rhetimo, are not le&s;s ab&s;olute within the limits of their governments than the Pachas of Candia. They enjoy the &s;ame pri|vileges, and their council is compo&s;ed of the &s;ame officers. The&s;e governors are only intent on rapidly enriching them&s;elves, and u&s;e every means of ex|torting
<PB N="187" REF="190">
money from the Greeks, who are oppre&s;&s;ed in a manner not to be de&s;cribed. But to &s;ay the truth, the&s;e unhappy people &s;tretch out their willing necks to the chain that weighs them down. Their envious di&s;po&s;ition is continually arming them again&s;t each other. If one of them has the good fortune to acquire a little property, others endeavour to di&s;|cover &s;omething of which to accu&s;e him before the Pacha, who avails him&s;elf of the&s;e di&s;&s;entions to rob both parties. It &s;eems as if the Greeks, deba&s;ed by their misfortunes, were no longer capable of a ge|nerous &s;entiment; nor are they in the lea&s;t amended by the cruel examples they have every day before their eyes.</P>
<P>It is not therefore &s;urpri&s;ing, that under this bar|barous government the number of Greeks &s;hould daily dimini&s;h. At pre&s;ent Crete is &s;uppo&s;ed to contain, at mo&s;t, only one hundred and fifty thou&s;and Greeks, &s;ixty-five thou&s;and of whom pay the capitation; a tribute paid to the Grand Signior by all his &s;ubjects not Mahometans; but levied, as we have before ob|&s;erved, only on men arrived at maturity, women and children being excepted. The Turks, though they have only po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the i&s;land one hundred and twenty years, or thereabouts, not being &s;ubject to the &s;ame oppre&s;&s;ion, have multiplied and flouri&s;hed on the ruins of the vanqui&s;hed. Their number
<PB N="188" REF="191">
amounts to two hundred thou&s;and. Is it not a&s;to|ni&s;hing, &s;ays <HI>Savory,</HI> to find &s;o few inhabitants on this i&s;land, which is above two hundred and fifty leagues in circumference? May not this diminution of men be con&s;idered a &s;ufficient proof of a de&s;truc|tive government?</P>
<P>The hundred cities of Crete have been celebrated by the writers of antiquity; and geography has pre|&s;erved to us their names and &s;ituations. Several of the&s;e contained thirty thou&s;and citizens; if there|fore, we allow &s;ix thou&s;and to each, this calculation for the hundred cities, will give &s;ix hundred thou|&s;and inhabitants: we may al&s;o e&s;timate the Cretans di&s;per&s;ed in the towns and villages at the &s;ame num|ber; which, added together, will make twelve hun|dred thou&s;and. This cannot be e&s;teemed an exag|gerated calculation. When the Venetians were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the kingdom of Candia, it is &s;aid to have contained nine hundred and ninety-&s;ix villages.</P>
<P>Thus we find, that when Crete was a free coun|try, it maintained near a million more of inhabitants than it does at pre&s;ent. But &s;ince tho&s;e happy times, this unfortunate i&s;land has been deprived of her laws by the Romans; groaned under the di&s;a&s;trous reigns of the corrupt princes of the Lower Empire; been ravaged by the Arabs, during a hundred and twenty

years; exchanged their government for that of the Venetians; and at length has been finally &s;ubjected to the de&s;poti&s;m of the Turks; who, in all the coun|tries they have conquered, have occa&s;ioned a fright|ful depopulation.</P>
<P>When Candia was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Venetians, the towns of Siria, Gira Petra, Si&s;ims and Sphachia, were crouded with inhabitants; at pre&s;ent they are wretched villages, with ruined fortre&s;&s;es and har|bours, nearly choaked up. Candia, the capital of the kingdom, was very populous, and carried on an exten&s;ive commerce in wines, corn, &s;ilks and wax. It was indeed a &s;econd Venice, but is now almo&s;t de&s;erted.</P>
<P>It is true, that the Turks, during a five and twenty years war, de&s;troyed many thou&s;ands of the Cana|dians; and that the plague, the con&s;tant attendant of their armies, followed them into this i&s;land, and was the de&s;truction of a &s;till greater number; but if the Ottoman government had con&s;idered men of any importance, it might have been able in the cour&s;e of a whole century of peace and tranquillity, to re|pair their ravages.</P>
<P>The Turks have left the Greeks the free exerci&s;e of their religion, but do not allow them to repair

their churches and mona&s;teries, without permi&s;&s;ion, which is only to be obtained by money, and brings in con&s;iderable &s;ums to the Pachas. They have, as formerly, twelve bi&s;hops; the principal of whom a&s;|&s;umes the title of Archbi&s;hop of Gortyna. He re|&s;ides at Candia, which is the &s;eat of the metropolitan church. Nominated him&s;elf by the patriarch of Con&s;tantinople, he fills up all the vacant &s;ees of the i&s;land. He bears the triple crown on his tiara; &s;igns in red; and is re&s;pon&s;ible for all the debts of the clergy. To fulfil the&s;e engagements, he levies heavy contributions on the other bi&s;hops; and e&s;pe|cially on the mona&s;teries. He is acknowledged as chief of the Greeks, whom he protects as far as his feeble influence extends. To him the government applies in matters of importance; and he alone, of his whole nation, has the privilege of entering a town on hor&s;eback.</P>
<P>It may not be here ami&s;s to give &s;ome account of the ancient government of this i&s;land, &s;o celebrated in antiquity; a government that <HI>Lycurgus</HI> took for his model in the in&s;titution he framed for Lacedemon; and which <HI>Strabo</HI> has thought an account of, not un|worthy his pen, and pre&s;erved its leading features in his immortal work.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="194">Ten magi&s;trates were annually cho&s;en in a na|tional a&s;&s;embly, by the plurality of voices, who were called <HI>Co&s;mi.</HI> They had the management of war, and all the mo&s;t important bu&s;ine&s;s. They po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the right of choo&s;ing coun&s;ellors from among the old men; and the&s;e, in number twenty-eight, com|po&s;ed the &s;enate of Crete, and were cho&s;en from among tho&s;e who had pa&s;&s;ed the office of <HI>Co&s;mi,</HI> or per&s;ons eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed by their merit and unimpeached integrity. The&s;e &s;enators held their dignity for life; great deference was paid to their opinion; and nothing finally determined without con&s;ulting them. The wi&s;dom of the Legi&s;lator had intended them for a counterpoi&s;e to the ambition of the ten chiefs, who&s;e power was &s;till farther circum|&s;cribed, by limiting the duration of their magi&s;tracy to one year.</P>
<P>This precaution did not end here, as the votes of the people might be improperly obtained, and their choice con&s;equently fall on a per&s;on unworthy of &s;o honourable a po&s;t; he very wi&s;ely provided, that whoever &s;hould di&s;grace the dignity of the <HI>Co&s;mi,</HI> might be removed, either in an a&s;&s;embly of the people, or by his colleagues only. So excellent a con&s;titution cau&s;ed <HI>Plato</HI> to &s;ay, "The republic which approaches too much to a monarchy, and that which admits too unre&s;trained a liberty, are
<PB N="192" REF="195">
equally remote from the ju&s;t medium. O Cretans! O Lacedemonians! Ye have avoided the&s;e two rocks, and e&s;tabli&s;hed your &s;tates on the mo&s;t &s;olid foundations."</P>
<P>Nothing can be more &s;imple than this form of go|vernment. A free people, con&s;cious they were un|able to govern them&s;elves, name magi&s;trates, into who&s;e hands they transfer their authority; the&s;e chiefs, inve&s;ted with regal power, elect &s;enators to aid them with their coun&s;els; which coun&s;ellors again can decide nothing of them&s;elves; but their office is perpetual, which encrea&s;es the re&s;pect paid them, and enables them to extend their knowledge and information. The ten chiefs of the republic have a powerful motive to incite them to act worthy the honourable &s;tation in which they are placed; as, on the one hand, they are checked by the fear of di&s;grace; and on the other, encouraged by the hope of one day becoming members of the national council.</P>
<P>This republic, which was as ancient as the &s;iege of Troy, &s;till flouri&s;hed in the time of <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar.</HI> We know of no other of &s;o long continuance. The Legi&s;lator founding the happine&s;s of the Cretans on liberty, gave them laws and in&s;titutions fitted to form men capable of defending their freedom. All
<PB N="193" REF="196">
the citizens were &s;oldiers, and all exerci&s;ed and ex|pert in the art of war; for we even find that fo|reigners re&s;orted to Crete, to be exerci&s;ed in that art. <HI>"Philopoemen",</HI> &s;ays <HI>Plutarch,</HI> "not enduring to remain inactive, and ardently de&s;irous of ac|quiring knowledge in the profe&s;&s;ion of arms, em|barked for Crete; where, having exerci&s;ed him&s;elf among that warlike people, well ver&s;ed in every mi|litary art, and accu&s;tomed to lead a frugal life, he returned to the Achozans, and &s;o much di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by the knowledge he had acquired, that he was immediately appointed general of the cavalry."</P>
<P>On the other hand the Legi&s;lator, per&s;uaded that conque&s;ts were u&s;ually only acts of violence and in|ju&s;tice, which frequently enfeeble, and almo&s;t al|ways corrupted the morals of the victorious nation, endeavoured to prevent the Cretans from trying to &s;ubdue foreign countries. And from the time the government of the country fir&s;t became republican, till it was attacked by the Romans, we never find the Cretans to have attempted any foreign inva&s;ion; an honour re&s;erved exclu&s;ively to them among all the people celebrated in hi&s;tory. Individuals might indeed &s;erve in the armies of other &s;tates; the kings and princes of which, knowing their bravery and &s;kill in archery, &s;trove who &s;hould fir&s;t induce them to enter into their pay; as each was de&s;irous to have
<PB N="194" REF="197">
in his army a body of Cretan bowmen, &s;ince the whole world could not produce any more expert. "The arrows of Gortyna", &s;ays <HI>Claudian,</HI> "hap|pily directed, carry certain wounds, and never fail."</P>
<P>The love of war did not extingui&s;h in the Cretans that exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility which made them cul|tivate and encourage the fine arts. "The Cretans di&s;played their munificence to <HI>Homer,</HI> by giving him a thou&s;and crowns; and, glorying in a genero&s;ity not to be &s;urpa&s;&s;ed, pre&s;erved the memory of their du|ration, by a public in&s;cription. In Crete, adds <HI>Ptolemy,</HI> men are &s;till more anxious to cultivate their minds, than to exerci&s;e their bodies. There|fore, when di&s;cord reigned among them, the voice of wi&s;dom, and the charms of poetry, brought them back to rea&s;on. <HI>Thales,</HI> of Gortyna, the in&s;tructor of <HI>Lycurgus,</HI> was one of their mo&s;t celebrated phi|lo&s;ophers, poets, and legi&s;lators; and he mo&s;t &s;uc|ce&s;sfully applied his knowledge and talents to re|&s;tore concord to his fellow-citizens. "His poetry", &s;ays <HI>Plutarch,</HI> in the life of <HI>Lycurgus,</HI> "con&s;i&s;ted of di&s;cour&s;es in ver&s;e, exhorting the people to unanimity and obedience to their &s;uperiors; he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the art of conveying, in the mo&s;t harmonious metre, the mo&s;t &s;olid and beneficial in&s;truction. So great was the effect of his poetry, that his hearers, who found their under&s;tanding as well as their ears, equally per|&s;uaded
<PB N="195" REF="198">
and charmed, gradually &s;uffered all their ani|mo&s;ity to &s;ub&s;ide; and, enamoured with the ble&s;&s;ings of peace, which he painted in the mo&s;t lively co|lours, forgot their inte&s;tine hatreds, and ranged them&s;elves under the &s;tandard of concord." Men, over whom poetry and mu&s;ic had &s;uch power, could not he enemies to plea&s;ure: and we accordingly find it to have been a cu&s;tom with them to mark their happy days with white &s;tones, and their unhappy ones with black. At the end of the year, they ex|amined the number of the&s;e &s;tones, and only e&s;teem|ed them&s;elves to have lived the days denoted by the white ones. Hence the in&s;cription frequent on their tombs: <HI>He lived &s;o many days; he exi&s;ted, &s;o many.</HI></P>
<P>At length the fatal period arrived, when the Ro|mans, elated with their victories, and proud of their power, a&s;pired to the empire of the world, and would no longer admit of any di&s;tinction among the &s;urrounding nations, but that of &s;laves or &s;ubjects. Since that period, that is, during a &s;pace of nineteen hundred years, the Cretans have cea&s;ed to be a na|tion, and have gradually lo&s;t their courage, their virtues, their &s;ciences, and their arts. This deplo|rable deba&s;ement can only be attributed to the ex|tinction of their liberty. So true is it, that man is born for liberty; and, that deprived of this &s;upport, received from nature to &s;u&s;tain his weakne&s;s, his ge|nius
<PB N="196" REF="199">
expires, and his courage langui&s;hes, till he &s;inks to the lowe&s;t point of degradation.</P>
<P>The olive-tree, that precious tree, con&s;ecrated to <HI>Minerva,</HI> has almo&s;t di&s;appeared from Attica. The Albanians and Turks, who have alternately ravaged Greece, &s;eem to have been intent on de&s;troying it. Within twenty years, they have cut down two hun|dred thou&s;and feet of the&s;e trees. Thus has the Morea, &s;o rich and flouri&s;hing, when po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Venetians, become a poor and mi&s;erable country.</P>
<P>The i&s;land of Crete, has not in this re&s;pect &s;uf|fered the &s;ame fate. The olive-trees, which delight in a &s;andy &s;oil, a mild temperature, and the vicinity of the &s;ea, grow in abundance on the hills, and in the plains. The cold is never &s;evere enough to in|jure them, and the heat is always &s;ufficient to ripen their fruit. We meet with &s;ome that &s;eem co-eval with the &s;oil that bears them; they grow to a va&s;t &s;ize, and attain the height of fifty feet. Their pro|duce con&s;titutes the chief wealth of the inhabitants, and their principal branch of commerce. The crops, however, are not equally abundant; in two years, one is generally excellent, and the other moderate. Exclu&s;ive of the prodigious con&s;umption of oil by the inhabitants, be&s;ides what the Turks of Canea, in&s;tructed by a native of Provence, make u&s;e of in
<PB N="197" REF="200">
their manufactories of &s;oap, which they export throughout the Levant, the Turks annually load four and twenty &s;hips with oil.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Candia had no manufacture in their i&s;land; and it is not long &s;ince a native of Pro|vence taught them to make &s;oap, of which they have now &s;everal manufactories at Canea. This betrayer of his country's intere&s;t, has greatly injured the trade of Mar&s;eilles.</P>
<P>The total exports from the i&s;land of Crete, <HI>Savary</HI> e&s;timates at little more than a hundred thou&s;and pounds; which is very incon&s;iderable for an i&s;land of &s;uch great extent. The i&s;land, &s;ays the above au|thor, does not contain a &s;ufficient number of in|habitants for all the lands to be cultivated. Plains of three or four leagues extent, and watered by fer|tilizing &s;treams, are frequently to be &s;een without the &s;lighte&s;t traces of cultivation. The indolent Turk pa&s;&s;es his life in the mid&s;t of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, with|out thinking of improvement; and &s;hould the Greek obtain permi&s;&s;ion to clear out a piece of ground, after bedewing it with the &s;weat of his brow, at the moment he is to enjoy the fruit of his indu&s;try, his powerful neighbour wre&s;ts from him, the produce of his labour.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="201">When the kingdom of Candia was under the go|vernment of the republic of Venice, it produced great quantities of grain; amply &s;upplied the wants of the inhabitants; and made con&s;iderable exporta|tions to foreign countries. At pre&s;ent the i&s;land is obliged to import corn. This is not to be attributed to any change of the &s;oil, which is &s;till warmed by the &s;ame &s;un, and watered by the &s;ame &s;treams. The tyranny of the Turki&s;h government mu&s;t alone be con&s;idered the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Corn, &s;ays <HI>Pcy&s;onnel,</HI> is not &s;carce in Candia, the plains of Me&s;&s;ara, and &s;everal other parts of the i&s;land, furni&s;h it in great abundance, and the annual har|ve&s;ts are quite &s;ufficient for the maintenance of the inhabitants; but, as the corn is incomparably fine, the Agas export a great quantity: European, Turk|i&s;h, and Greek ve&s;&s;els, are perpetually engaged in this illicit commerce; on which account, Candia is frequently obliged to depend on the Morea for &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence. Oil, and &s;oap, indeed, compo&s;e the two principal branches of commerce in this i&s;land; but, it likewi&s;e produces an infinity of articles of import|ance, as very fine &s;ilk, wax, honey &s;ufficient, cotton for the con&s;umption of the country, and chee&s;es; which a contraband trade exports to Egypt, the coa&s;t of Barbary, Italy, and Provence.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="202">Objects of the la&s;t importance, adds <HI>Savary,</HI> which would infinitely extend the commerce of the Cretans, are almo&s;t totally neglected. The mulberry-tree thrives admirably in the i&s;land; and nothing would be more ea&s;y than to rear &s;ilk-worms. The little cotton which is cultivated there, is of a very fine quality; and the wool, though not remarkable for its finene&s;s, is &s;o for its quantity; yet there is not a &s;ingle manu|facture in the country, which may employ the&s;e va|luable materials! Little attention, therefore, is paid to the &s;ilk-worm: cotton and flax are cultivated in &s;mall quantities; and never will it occur to the imagi|nation of a Turk, that under a mild and favourable &s;ky, which would allow the flocks to be folded the whole year in the open air; it might be po&s;&s;ible, by paying due attention to their feeding, and properly cro&s;&s;ing the breed, to obtain wool, even equal to that of Spain.</P>
<P>What advantages might not a poli&s;hed nation derive from an i&s;land, which, after &s;atisfying the mo&s;t e&s;&s;en|tial wants of man, would &s;till farther &s;upply him with every thing that contributes to utility, ea&s;e, and even luxury! How might they extend their various branches of commerce! What benefits might they not derive from manufactures calculated to give them value! The delicious wines of the country, &s;o little known, would be in reque&s;t over the whole world.
<PB N="200" REF="203">
Fore&s;ts of pines, oaks, and cedars, under proper ma|nagement, would be of u&s;e for &s;hip-building. The hu&s;bandmen, excited by the hope and certainty of enjoying the fruit of their labours, would clear out va&s;t tracts of wa&s;te land, now abandoned to &s;terility; would &s;ow every &s;pecies of grain, increa&s;e their plan|tations, and after enriching the &s;tate, live in plenty, in the bo&s;om of their numerous families. Men would multiply without end, and in the fine&s;t climate in the world; villages, and impoveri&s;hed towns, would again become populous cities; the arts would again return to their native country, and again flouri&s;h; in a word, the &s;uperb i&s;land of Crete, would once more revive from her a&s;hes. To produce this extraordinary, this happy change, nothing is nece&s;&s;ary but the encourage|ment and protection of a wi&s;e government.</P>
<P>The&s;e reflections are not the dreams of a heated imagination, or of a traveller who has ha&s;tily pa&s;&s;ed through the country; but of one who continued in the i&s;land fifteen months; who vi&s;ited its mountains and the plains; who was well acquainted with its produc|tions; who knows in what they are &s;u&s;ceptible of im|provement, and who can take upon him to a&s;&s;ert, that in the whole world there is no country that combines &s;o many real advantages. The lofty trees of the frozen regions, crown the &s;ummits of the mountains, while le&s;s lofty hills are covered with the fruit-trees

Let it be ob&s;erved too, &s;ays <HI>Savary,</HI> that nature has placed the fine&s;t harbours on the Ea&s;t, We&s;t, and North &s;ides of the i&s;land, as if its commerce was de&s;tined to extend to every quar|ter of the globe.</P>

<P>THIS i&s;land has made &s;uch a con&s;picuous figure in the page of hi&s;tory, that an account of it mu&s;t prove highly intere&s;ting to tho&s;e, who are fond of re&s;earches into the &s;ituation of remote nations. It lies under the fifty-&s;econd degree of Ea&s;t longitude, and the thirty-fifth of North latitude, between the coa&s;t of Syria, and that of Cilicia, at pre&s;ent called Caramania; being in the mo&s;t Ea&s;terly part of the

Levant. This country was formerly known by a great many different names. <HI>Pliny</HI> calls it Acamantis, Cera&s;tis, A&s;phelia, Amathu&s;ia, Macaria, Cryptos, and Colinia. In other hi&s;torians, it may be found under the denomination of Chetime, Ero&s;a, Paphos, and Sa|lamis; and in the poets under that of Cythera: the latter made it the birth-place of <HI>Venus,</HI> and the abode of the graces; hence, tho&s;e charming de&s;criptions which they have given of it; and tho&s;e enchanting &s;cenes, of which, according to their account, it was the theatre. Their ingenious painting has perpetuated the illu&s;ion; and the names of Pathos, Cythera, and Amathonte; tho&s;e &s;pots, more peculiarly con&s;ecrated to the godde&s;s of plea&s;ure, &s;till awaken the mo&s;t agree|able and delightful ideas.</P>
<P>It contained formerly, nine kingdoms, tributary to Egypt, and &s;oon after to the Romans. From the emperors of the We&s;t, it pa&s;&s;ed to tho&s;e of the Ea&s;t; but was taken from them by the Arabs, under the reign of <HI>Heraclius.</HI> A prince of the family of the Comenii, fired with ambition, &s;eized on the whole i&s;land, and e&s;tabli&s;hed him&s;elf &s;overeign of it. In 1191, our <HI>Richard</HI> I. deprived him of it, together with his life. Being afterwards &s;old by this monarch to the <HI>Templars,</HI> difference of religion cau&s;ed the in|habitants to rebel again&s;t their new &s;overeigns; and, the knights apprehending they &s;hould not be able to

retain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, delivered back the i&s;land to <HI>Richard,</HI> who renounced it in favour of <HI>Guy de Lu&s;ig|nan.</HI> In 1480, it came under the dominion of the Venetians, and was taken from them the &s;ucceeding century by the Turks.</P>
<P>This beautiful i&s;land is about two hundred and twenty miles in length; &s;ixty-five in breadth, and about &s;ix hundred in circumference, including the gulphs. A chain of mountains, the highe&s;t of which are Olympus, St. Croix, and Bu&s;&s;avent, divide it from Ea&s;t to We&s;t.</P>
<P>The large&s;t of its plains is that of Me&s;&s;area; where the wandering eye lo&s;es it&s;elf, in an extent of eighty miles in length, and thirty in breadth; while a variety of objects add to the plea&s;ure ari&s;ing from a view of this immen&s;e horizon.</P>
<P>There are few rivers, or torrents here, the beds of which, even in winter, are not entirely dry; and this ari&s;es from the great &s;carcity of rain. The heavens are, as it were, of bra&s;s; and hi&s;torians a&s;&s;ert, that in the reign of <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> no rain fell in this i&s;land for the &s;pace of thirty years. It may ea&s;ily be conceived, how injurious a drought of &s;uch continuance, mu&s;t have been to vegetation.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="207">There were formerly in this i&s;land, a great number of cities; of which, at pre&s;ent, nothing remains but the names, and a few ruins. There are &s;ome, for the ancient &s;ituation of which, it would be in vain to &s;earch. Famagu&s;ta, and Nico&s;ia, are the only places of importance; unle&s;s Larnic, where the European merchants have their factory, may be cla&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame rank. Be&s;ides the&s;e, Cyprus contains &s;even citadels, which are commanded by the &s;ame number of governors.</P>
<P>This i&s;land has produced many great men, di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by their birth, their virtues, and their know|ledge. <HI>Strabo</HI> does not he&s;itate to &s;ay, that in this re&s;pect it is &s;uperior to mo&s;t of the Grecian i&s;lands.</P>
<P>Some authors a&s;&s;ert, that the air of this i&s;land is bad and unhealthful. This prejudice, prevents many &s;trangers from remaining long enough in it to make the experiment. But tho&s;e who have inhabited the i&s;land for a twelvemonth have been convinced of its whole&s;omene&s;s, and of the error of ancient writers.</P>
<P>Tertian and quartan fevers are, it is true, very common and very ob&s;tinate in Cyprus, and in all the Levant; but the&s;e do not &s;o much ari&s;e from the ma|lignity of the air, becau&s;e it is ea&s;y to avoid them. The exce&s;&s;ive heat of the climate, cau&s;es an abundant

per&s;piration. If people in this &s;ituation, are &s;o im|prudent to expo&s;e them&s;elves to the lea&s;t breath of wind, the pores become &s;hut, and per&s;piration is &s;top|ped, which infallibly brings on a fever. Another cau&s;e of the&s;e fevers is, the immoderate u&s;e of &s;trong liquors, and fruits, particularly cucumbers and melons. Even the inhabitants &s;eldom e&s;cape this epidemical di&s;order, e&s;pecially in &s;ummer; but by &s;light bleeding, and leaving nature to her&s;elf, they are cured without phy&s;ic, or any other regimen, than that of ab&s;taining from fruits.</P>
<P>This i&s;land was formerly, one of the riche&s;t and mo&s;t fertile in the world. It abounded with mines of gold, &s;ilver, copper, iron, marca&s;ite, rock alum, and even emeralds; but of the&s;e ancient productions, nothing remains be&s;ides the remembrance, and the places from which they were procured. The pre&s;ent government fetters curio&s;ity, and forbids every kind of re&s;earch. Some centuries ago, a great quantity of oil was made here; but in the time of the Venetians, a &s;pirit of &s;peculation aboli&s;hed that u&s;eful branch, and the cultivation of olives was abandoned for that of cottons. Saffron, rhubarb, and other valuable pro|ductions, are at pre&s;ent totally neglected. Deer, roe|bucks, a&s;&s;es, wild bears, and a great number of the mo&s;t beautiful phea&s;ants, once enlivened the plains of Cyprus; but they are now all de&s;troyed; and it would

<P>The principal productions of the i&s;land are, at pre&s;ent, &s;ilk, cotton, wool, nutmegs, wines, turpen|tine, kermes, laudanum, wheat, barley, coloquintida, pitch, tar, gla&s;s-wort, &s;alt, St. John's, bread, timber, umbre, and green earth.</P>
<P>The &s;oil here, likewi&s;e, produces pul&s;e and all kinds of wild herbs; a knowledge of which, would be a va|luable acqui&s;ition in botany; but there are few trees, and con&s;equently few fruits. Nature, however, to make amends for this lo&s;s, has been exceedingly lavi&s;h in flowers; and the mo&s;t beautiful and delicate plants of Italy, France, and Holland, may ea&s;ily be natura|lized. Hyacinths, anemonies, ranunculu&s;es, and nar|ci&s;&s;u&s;es, both &s;ingle and double, which require &s;o much care in Europe, thrive even upon the moun|tains without cultivation; and render the beautiful plains of this i&s;land, like an immen&s;e parterre. Nothing can be more agreeable than to walk near the &s;pots where they grow, at &s;un-ri&s;ing, and &s;un-&s;etting; when the odoriferous particles, put in motion by the heat of the &s;un, or conden&s;ed by the coolne&s;s of the evening, convey to the organs of &s;mell, a mixture of every perfume: it is then that the enchanting dreams of fa|bulous antiquity are realized; and that this i&s;land
<PB N="207" REF="210">
&s;eems &s;till the abode of plea&s;ure, and birth-place of love.</P>
<P>Among the wild flowers, there is one called me|li&s;&s;a, or the bee-flower, which indeed has the &s;hape of that indu&s;trious animal: its root may be ranked among the cla&s;s of bulbous plants. The juice of it is an excellent &s;pecific for healing wounds.</P>
<P>The Cypriots cultivate a plant, which they call chenna; which is as tall and big as the pomegranate, and re&s;embles it in its trunk and branches; its leaves are like tho&s;e of the myrtle, and its flowers like a bunch of grapes in blo&s;&s;om. An oil is extracted from the fruit, which has all the properties of balm. The leaves, either dried or green, when boiled in water, communicate a beautiful orange dye to cloth or &s;tuff. The Cypriots u&s;e it for dying their hair, which once impregnated with this colour, retains it for a long time after. The Turki&s;h, and &s;ome of the Greek women, rub their nails and the palms of their hand with it; from an idea that it will render their &s;kin white, and give a higher bloom to the carna|tion of their cheeks. In every country of the world, one part of the women have endeavoured to add to the graces of nature, and the other to repair her faults; all the &s;cents and co&s;metics invented by quackery, have been often put to the proof; but
<PB N="208" REF="211">
they have never been able to cure the in&s;urmount|able credulity of the &s;ex.</P>
<P>The Venetians, when ma&s;ters of this i&s;land, u&s;ed to paint their hor&s;es; but this cu&s;tom is only con|tinued in regard to white greyhounds and &s;heep.</P>
<P>For want of hands, great part of this i&s;land is uncultivated, and produces nothing but thyme and other odoriferous herbs, which perfume the &s;ur|rounding atmo&s;phere. The luxuriance of nature, left to her&s;elf, &s;ufficiently &s;hews what happy effects agri|culture would have on the&s;e fertile de&s;arts.</P>
<P>In the &s;ide of a mountain, near Paphos, is a ca|vern, which produces the mo&s;t beautiful rock cry&s;tal. On account of its brilliancy, it has been called the Paphian diamond: it is cut and poli&s;hed in the &s;ame manner as other precious &s;tones. People are forbid, under &s;evere puni&s;hment, to carry away the &s;malle&s;t piece, and the mountain is &s;urrounded with guards.</P>
<P>A &s;imilar prohibition has been made re&s;pecting the &s;tone amianthus, or a&s;be&s;tos, of which there is a quarry, near the village of Paleandros. Incombu&s;|tible cloth, it is &s;aid, has been made of it; and fire, in&s;tead of dimini&s;hing, increa&s;es its whitene&s;s. This fact, founded on the relation of <HI>Pliny,</HI> and <HI>Dio&s;corides,</HI>
<PB N="209" REF="212">
is in the opinion of the moderns, one of tho&s;e errors &s;o common in the philo&s;ophy of the ancients. The Greeks, at pre&s;ent, call this &s;tone <HI>cari&s;tia,</HI> and &s;ome others the cotton &s;tone.</P>
<P>There are found here al&s;o red ja&s;pers, agates, and three different kinds of &s;tone. The hills neare&s;t to Larnic, con&s;i&s;t wholly of tale, which &s;erves for the compo&s;ition of that plai&s;ter u&s;ed in all the hou&s;es of the country.</P>
<P>No wild animals are &s;een here but foxes and hares: the odoriferous plants on which the latter feed, give their fle&s;h an excellent ta&s;te, and a mo&s;t agreeable fla|vour. Hunting is the chief diver&s;ion of the Euro|peans in this i&s;land; and they maintain, at a very great expence, hor&s;es, and packs of hounds. No &s;ea&s;on can check their activity; troops of hunters repair to the field, by break of day, and pur&s;ue, without intermi&s;&s;ion, their fugitive inhabitants.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t common of the winged tribe are rails, partridges, &s;nipes, quails, and thru&s;hes. Of water-fowl, there is great abundance. Rails and par|tridges co&s;t about two-pence a-piece, &s;nipes are &s;omething dearer, as the inhabitants account them a delicacy. All other birds are &s;o cheap, that they are rather given away than &s;old. The beccaficos, and
<PB N="210" REF="213">
ortolans, are remarkably fat; and &s;o numerous, that the pea&s;ants think they make a good market when they can di&s;po&s;e of them at the rate of a penny a dozen. They are generally caught in greate&s;t abun|dance near the village of S. Nappa; a part of which they carry to the city, parboiling the re&s;t, and putting them into vinegar, with &s;ome ingredients proper for pre&s;erving them. In this manner they keep them a whole year, and &s;ell them at the &s;ame price as the re&s;t. The grand vent for the&s;e birds is among the Europeans of Larnic, who &s;end them to France, England, Holland, and various parts of the Ottoman empire. There are exported every year from this i&s;land, four hundred barrels, containing from two to four hundred birds in each. The u&s;ual method of dre&s;&s;ing them in Cyprus, is to &s;plit them in the middle, and put them on the gridiron, with a &s;lice of bread, and a little par&s;ley: when broiled in this manner, they make a mo&s;t delicious meal.</P>
<P>In the months of July and Augu&s;t, the fields are covered with flocks of vultures; but it appears this i&s;land is only a re&s;ting place in their pa&s;&s;age to &s;ome other country. All other birds, the beccafico not excepted, lay their eggs here, though it is pretended that none of their eggs were ever &s;een in the i&s;land; but this is no more true with re&s;pect to Cyprus, than
<PB N="211" REF="214">
of a thou&s;and other places, where the &s;ame thing has been a&s;&s;erted with as little foundation.</P>
<P>Among the venomous animals is a kind of &s;erpent, the Greek name of which &s;ignifies the <HI>deaf-&s;nake;</HI> its bite is mortal; the body is about two feet long, and an inch in diameter; the colour is black and yellow, and it has two &s;mall horns on its head. The Greeks have given it a very improper name, it being by no means deaf. It generally frequents corn fields; and the reapers, be&s;ides wearing bu&s;kins, &s;ix &s;mall bells to their &s;cythes, in order to frighten it away. This precaution would be entirely u&s;ele&s;s, if nature had deprived it of the organs of hearing. At the village of Tremitice is a Greek family, in whom the virtue of curing this bite is hereditary. I &s;aw two people wounded, &s;ays <HI>Mariti,</HI> apply to a relation of this family, who cured them merely by touching them. All tho&s;e who de&s;pi&s;ed this remedy, became victims to their incredulity, and died &s;ome time after. It is certain that all the virtue con&s;i&s;ts in a &s;ecret known only to the&s;e people; for, in touching the wound, they dexterou&s;ly apply a certain powder, which cau&s;es a mo&s;t acute pain, but it vani&s;hes in a moment.</P>
<P>The tarantula of Cyprus, is a kind of &s;pider, of a brown colour, inclining to a black, and covered
<PB N="212" REF="215">
with long hair; its bite is not mortal, but it is dan|gerous; and often occa&s;ions excruciating pain, ac|companied with a fever.</P>
<P>That of the galley is incurable. This is a thin flat animal, about a foot and a half long; of a yellow colour; and furni&s;hed with a multitude of legs, which it moves uniformly, like the oars of a galley; hence it has acquired that name.</P>
<P>There is here al&s;o a black &s;erpent, about a yard, or a yard and a half long; but it is not venomous; people take it in their hands without danger; and, having &s;tripped off its &s;kin, broil the fle&s;h, which is &s;aid to be extremely well ta&s;ted.</P>
<P>The hor&s;es of Cyprus are not proper for the cour&s;e; but at Paphos, there are &s;ome highly e&s;teemed for their pace, called <HI>ciapcun;</HI> a kind of accelerated trot, which they will continue for &s;ix hours together, over hills and plains, without fatiguing the traveller. The a&s;&s;es have the &s;ame pace, as well as the mules, which are reckoned the be&s;t in the whole Levant.</P>
<P>The oxen here are lean, and of a &s;mall &s;ize. The Greeks never eat beef; they hold it as a maxim, that the animal which tills the ground, is the &s;ervant of
<PB N="213" REF="216">
man, and the companion of his daily labours, and, ought not to be u&s;ed for food.</P>
<P>The mutton is juicy and tender: the tails of &s;ome of the &s;heep, which are remarkably fine weigh up|wards of fifty pounds; and there are many that have three, or even five horns. Nothing can be more beautiful than the flocks of goats &s;een in this i&s;land. The great cleanline&s;s of this animal, the variety of its colours, and its &s;potted &s;kin, afford a &s;pectacle truly intere&s;ting. When &s;u&s;pended from a rock, or traver&s;ing the plains, its agility, and wanton gambols, form an agreeable contract with the dignity of other animals.</P>
<P>The greyhounds here, are excellent for the chace, and the lightning is &s;carce more rapid than their flight; no &s;ooner have they darted forward, than they are &s;een on their prey; and, on this account, tho&s;e who wi&s;h to enjoy long &s;port, take care to chu&s;e the heavie&s;t. Greyhounds of a good breed have their ears and tail white, and exceedingly &s;oft; their thighs long, nervous and robu&s;t; and the re&s;t of their body red.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXXIII.</HI> Cities, Manners and Cu&s;toms, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING now given a general view of the face of the country, in this celebrated i&s;land of an|tiquity, and of its productions; we &s;hall proceed in this chapter to &s;peak of the different cities; and the manners and cu&s;toms of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>Nico&s;ia, Farmagu&s;ta, and Larnic, &s;eem at pre&s;ent the mo&s;t important towns in this i&s;land. Of the an|cient city of Cithera, &s;o celebrated in the works of the poets, and con&s;ecrated to the godde&s;s of beauty, no ve&s;tiges remain; nor are there any of the ancient Pathos, which contained the celebrated temple of <HI>Venus,</HI> and was, together with the city, de&s;troyed by an earthquake.</P>
<P>Nico&s;ia &s;tands in the centre of the i&s;land, in the middle of a va&s;t plain, and is &s;urrounded by hills and mountains; which bound it on all &s;ides, at the di&s;|tance of ten miles.</P>
<P>From the time of <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> till 1567, the cir|cumference of this city was ten miles; but the Vene|tians
<PB N="215" REF="218">
reduced it to three, and fortified it, thinking by this means the conque&s;t of it would be more dif|ficult. Nothing was re&s;pected: they even demoli&s;hed temples, palaces, and the mo&s;t beautiful monuments; and the gloomy policy of this people &s;oon reduced Nico&s;ia to a heap of ruins. There are &s;till to be &s;een the foundations of a citadel, erected by king <HI>James</HI> I. of the <HI>Lu&s;ignans,</HI> and the remains of a con|ventual church, in which were buried &s;everal &s;ove|reigns; and among others, <HI>Hugo</HI> IV. to whom <HI>Boc|cace</HI> dedicated his book on the genealogy of the gods.</P>
<P>A river, named Pedicus, ran through the ancient city; but in 1567, its cour&s;e was changed. At pre|&s;ent it is almo&s;t entirely dry; and the little water &s;een in it during winter, refre&s;hes the neighbouring plains.</P>
<P>The city of Nico&s;ia, under the family of the <HI>Lu|&s;ignans,</HI> was the re&s;idence of the kings, and the &s;ee of an archbi&s;hop. It contained a great many mo|na&s;teries, three hundred churches, and a number of palaces and public buildings. The year 1570, was fatal to this city. In the month of June, of the &s;ame year, the Turks entered Cyprus, with a nu|merous army, and after a &s;iege of forty-five days, in which the inhabitants performed prodigies of valour, Nico&s;ia was taken by a general a&s;&s;ault. Of fifty thou|&s;and
<PB N="216" REF="219">
people, who had retired within the walls for &s;helter, twenty thou&s;and were ma&s;&s;acred, and the re&s;t put in irons.</P>
<P>Between the gate of Famagu&s;ta, and that of Paphos, are &s;everal tombs rai&s;ed on a ba&s;tion, one of which, exceedingly beautiful, and of the fine&s;t marble, is &s;aid to be that of the officer, who fir&s;t planted the Ottoman &s;tandard on the walls.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t beautiful edifice in this city, is, without doubt, the church of St. <HI>Sophia,</HI> where the kings of Cyprus were formerly crowned. It is built in the Gothic &s;tyle, and con&s;i&s;ts of three large naves. It contains the tombs of the <HI>Lu&s;ignans,</HI> and of &s;everal ancient Cypriots, and noble Venetians. As age has effaced the in&s;criptions, they are ab&s;olutely unintel|ligible; and the figures on the &s;tones are &s;o much mutilated, that they cannot be di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>The church of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> is, at pre&s;ent, the be|&s;i&s;ten, a kind of hall, where all &s;orts of provi&s;ions are &s;old. The principal merchants likewi&s;e a&s;&s;emble here, to tran&s;act bu&s;ine&s;s. When I beheld a croud of the&s;e merchants a&s;&s;embled, in this ancient temple, &s;ays <HI>Mariti,</HI> I could not help reflecting on that &s;trange &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of events, which puts conquerors into the place of the conquered; converts a church into an
<PB N="217" REF="220">
exchange; and makes an abode of peace, &s;et apart for prayer and devotion, the centre of all the petty intere&s;ts of mankind.</P>
<P>The &s;eraglio, is the palace of the Muha&s;&s;il. The entrance is through a large court, around which, are various buildings; and at the bottom, the &s;tables. This edifice is built in the Gothic ta&s;te, and was the royal re&s;idence in the time of the Chri&s;tians: it has ex|perienced &s;o many changes, under a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ba&s;haws, that its original appearance is almo&s;t de&s;troy|ed. In the neighbouring &s;quare, is a Turki&s;h foun|tain, affording excellent water, for which this city is famous.</P>
<P>From the ruins of the ancient buildings, &s;ome idea may be formed of what this city originally was; it plainly appearing, the &s;treets were &s;pacious enough to di&s;play the magnificence of the palaces and building with which it was embelli&s;hed. This mode of building has been neglected, and there is now no regular plan. The greater part of the hou&s;es are perfect huts, which de&s;troy the charm ari&s;ing from uniformity, and make a ridiculous contract with the &s;uperb &s;tructures near them.</P>
<P>The principal officers of the porte, to &s;uperintend the government of the i&s;land, re&s;ide in this city. It
<PB N="218" REF="221">
is al&s;o the re&s;idence of the principal Greek and Armi|nian families; who, by their different employments, depend on the Turki&s;h government.</P>
<P>The chief branch of trade is cotton, cloth, manu|factured in the city, though mo&s;t of the other manu|factures are carried on in the neighbouring villages. The Turkey leather of this place, has a more brilliant and lively colour than that of Barbary; and the painted cottons, in&s;tead of lo&s;ing their &s;plendor, by being wa&s;hed with &s;oap, become more beautiful. The dye of the Buca&s;&s;ins, a kind of &s;tuffs, is com|po&s;ed of a mixture of the root of Boia, and ox's blood; this red colour, well imprinted, never fades.</P>
<P>The country about Nico&s;ia, is lively and animated. From the top of the ramparts, may be &s;een a great number of hamlets and villages; &s;ome of which, are very populous and flouri&s;hing. The inhabitants do not confine them&s;elves to agriculture; but &s;pin cotton, and manufacture cloth, which they afterwards &s;ell in the capital. The greater part of the&s;e villages, are ornamented with Greek churches, and groves of mul|berry-trees, which were formerly more numerous than they are at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The mulberries in Cyprus, are planted at an equal di&s;tance from each other, in &s;trait lines; and, forming
<PB N="219" REF="222">
a &s;mall &s;quare grove, compo&s;ed of one, two, three, and even five thou&s;and plants. They are &s;omewhat more than five feet in height, and about two feet in circum|ference. The&s;e trees grow naturally taller; but at Cyprus, the people lop the branches, that they may have the leaves to give to their &s;ilk worms. Thus, the&s;e trees are not &s;uffered to grow old, nor does the pruning knife even re&s;pect their fir&s;t &s;hoots: care, therefore, is taken every year to plant new ones, in order to &s;upply a &s;ufficiency of leaves. No other at|tention is paid to them, than to water them once or twice a day in &s;ummer. A &s;mall re&s;ervoir, made in the form of a va&s;e, is dug round each tree; and the water being conveyed into it, by &s;mall canals, &s;erves to refre&s;h the roots.</P>
<P>The city of Famagu&s;ta, was formerly called Ar|&s;inoe, from the name of the &s;i&s;ter of <HI>Ptolemy Phila|delphus,</HI> who laid the foundation of it. The name of Famagu&s;ta, comes originally from Amocu&s;ta, which &s;ignifies <HI>built in the &s;and;</HI> and was given it, on account of the thin &s;andy earth that &s;urrounds it. This city is &s;ituated on the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of the i&s;land; it is built on a rock, and is two miles in circumference. The walls are thick, &s;trongly built, and flat on the top. They are &s;urrounded by a deep ditch, cut out of the &s;olid rock, and are flanked by twelve enormous towers; the &s;ides of which, are four paces in thickne&s;s,
<PB N="220" REF="223">
and enclo&s;e a circle five paces in diameter. In 1571, this city, which may be called the key of the i&s;land, was taken by the Turks, after a &s;iege of ten months. The Ottoman army con&s;i&s;ted of two hundred thou|&s;and men. In the ten months, during which the &s;iege was carried on, the Turks fired five hundred and forty thou&s;and bombs. At pre&s;ent, the remains of them may be &s;een in the neighbouring gardens and fields; and in the ditches, which &s;urround the city, where they are &s;till lying in heaps.</P>
<P>We may form &s;ome idea of the bravery of the Ve|netians, from the number of Turks who were killed before the place. The garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ted of &s;carcely four thou&s;and men; and yet they de&s;troyed above &s;eventy-five thou&s;and Turks.</P>
<P>Famagu&s;ta, in its external appearance, is &s;till in the &s;ame &s;tate as formerly. The ditch is entirely dry; and the walls are in good condition, except a few towers which were damaged by the enemies can|non, and which have not been repaired.</P>
<P>The interior part of the city, exhibits a very ruin|ous appearance. The number of churches demoli&s;hed is immen&s;e. A very &s;mall &s;pot only, contained two hundred; whereas, at pre&s;ent, there are &s;carce &s;o many inhabitants in the whole city.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="224">At the di&s;tance of &s;ix miles from Famagu&s;ta, &s;tood the ancient Salamis, which owed its origin to <HI>Teucer,</HI> whom his father drove from the i&s;land of Salamis, his native country. This illu&s;trious exile, when at a di&s;tance from the &s;pot which had given him birth, wi&s;hed, at lea&s;t, to have an image of it, and built this new Salamis, mentioned by <HI>Horace.</HI> No edifice has &s;urvived the wreck of time, that can give us any idea of this city. Nothing is to be &s;een but &s;cattered co|lumns; heaps of &s;tone embrowned by age; and the ruins of a building, &s;uppo&s;ed to be a temple.</P>
<P>Salamis can boa&s;t of having produced a great number of illu&s;trious men. It was the country of <HI>Ari&s;to,</HI> the hi&s;torian, of whom <HI>Strabo</HI> &s;peaks. <HI>Solon,</HI> one of the Grecian &s;ages, is believed to have been originally from this city. <HI>Cleobulus</HI> was born at Sa|lamis, as was <HI>Neocrion,</HI> who commanded the naval army of <HI>Alexander the Great; cum multis aliis.</HI></P>
<P>Larnic, di&s;tant from the port of Salines, about half a league, is &s;ituated to the North of the ancient Ci|tium; and even occupies a part of the ground on which it once &s;tood. It lies in the Southern part of the i&s;land. Its origin is not preci&s;ely known; but may be attributed to the proximity of the &s;ea, and the ma|terials found in the ruins of Citium. The port of Salines, is one of the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing in the kingdom;
<PB N="222" REF="225">
this is owing, no doubt, to its happy &s;ituation, and its proximity to Larnic, the centre of the commerce of Cyprus. This place was formerly re&s;orted to by people from all countries; and the Cypriots &s;till re|gret tho&s;e days of &s;plendor; when, amid&s;t &s;o many nations, cu&s;toms, and different languages; each of them could, like the ancient philo&s;opher, call him&s;elf a citizen of the world. Since that period, things are greatly changed. When I beheld this harbour, &s;ays <HI>Mariti,</HI> at pre&s;ent de&s;erted and called to mind its ancient celebrity, I imagined I &s;aw the bed of a dry river; and that the multitude of foreign names, in|&s;cribed and confounded on the neighbouring &s;tones, were like tho&s;e numerical &s;igns, which, long after the annihilation of its waters, are an evidence of its former abundance.</P>
<P>The town of Salines, which &s;tands on the borders of the &s;ea, extends much further in length than in breadth. The citadel built by the Turks, in 1625, is furni&s;hed with a great many pieces of artillery taken from the Venetians. This fortre&s;s, full of fi&s;&s;ures, and embrowned with age towards the &s;ea, is falling fa&s;t into decay; whil&s;t its ancient walls are almo&s;t hid by a multitude of plants; the offspring of time, the tender and delicate &s;hades of which, form a charming contra&s;t with the dark and gloomy colour of its ruins.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="226">The adjoining city has been de&s;cribed, by mo&s;t travellers, only as a pretty con&s;iderable town; but, if we ob&s;erve, that it is the &s;torehou&s;e of commerce for the i&s;land, and that it holds the &s;econd rank in the kingdom, though dependent on the government of Nico&s;ia; it will be allowed, we may be ju&s;tified in &s;tyling Larnic a city. Be&s;ides, it is al&s;o the &s;eat of a Greek bi&s;hop; and the place where the European con|&s;uls have fixed their re&s;idence.</P>
<P>However this may be, &s;ays <HI>Mariti,</HI> it is the mo&s;t agreeable town in the whole i&s;land; for, I know nothing more intere&s;ting, he adds, than a commercial city. I experience a &s;ecret plea&s;ure, in &s;eeing a va&s;t concour&s;e of citizens and foreigners, labouring in concert for the happine&s;s of mankind; and making, of any metropolis, a magazine for the whole world. In my eyes, the exchange is a va&s;t a&s;&s;embly, where all nations have their repre&s;entatives. Factors, in the commercial world, are what amba&s;&s;adors are in the political: they negociate affairs; &s;ign treaties; and keep up a u&s;eful corre&s;pondence, between rich &s;o|cieties of men, divided by &s;eas, and living at the two extremities of the earth. I have often contemplated, with a plea&s;ing emotion, an inhabitant of Japan, di&s;|cu&s;&s;ing his intere&s;t with a citizen of London; or a &s;ubject of the great Mogul, entering into contract with a Ru&s;&s;ian. I was fond of being among the&s;e nume|rous
<PB N="224" REF="227">
agents of commerce, di&s;tingui&s;hed by their dre&s;s, their manners, and their language; and all &s;earching for the &s;ame point by different routes. Here I beheld a body of Armenians; there an a&s;&s;embly of Jews; and a little further a group of Dutchmen. I became in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, a Dane, a Swede, a Frenchman; or, rather I was a citizen of the world.</P>
<P>All the buildings in this city, are modern; and it contains no monument of remote antiquity. The mo&s;que was formerly a Latin church, and is the only Turki&s;h place of wor&s;hip in Larnic. The Greeks have here three churches, in which the people a&s;&s;em|ble three hours before day; for all their religious ce|remonies mu&s;t be fini&s;hed before &s;un-ri&s;e.</P>
<P>Every Greek and Latin church is &s;urrounded by walls. The entrance is through a gate about three feet and a half in height; which is made &s;o low, in order to prevent the Turks from introducing hor&s;es, and other animals into the inclo&s;ure.</P>
<P>Public edifices are all con&s;tructed of &s;tone. Every other building is formed of bricks, compo&s;ed of a mixture of chopped &s;traw, and moi&s;t earth, dried in the &s;un. The cement u&s;ed, is nothing but the &s;ame clayey earth, with the addition of a little fre&s;h &s;traw. Such, in general, is the con&s;truction of all the hou&s;es
<PB N="225" REF="228">
in the kingdom, except in a few villages, where &s;tones are very common.</P>
<P>The earthy colour of the&s;e bricks gives them, ex|ternally, a di&s;mal and melancholy appearance; and travellers are agreeably &s;urprized, to find the in&s;ide of the hou&s;es airy, and commodious: the walls are whitened with a compo&s;ition of tale.</P>
<P>The&s;e hou&s;es have only one &s;tory above the ground-floor: the roofs are formed of earth, mixed with clay; and the crevices, produced by the heat in &s;ummer, clo&s;e of them&s;elves, during the rains in winter. They are about nine inches in thickne&s;s; and are &s;upported by large beams, over which are laid very thin laths, covered with mats made of reeds; they are, how|ever, not proof again&s;t a continuance of wet weather; and the inhabitants are under the nece&s;&s;ity of giving them continual repair. Hou&s;es built after this man|ner, have, at lea&s;t, one advantage; which is, that they re&s;i&s;t earthquakes. Sad experience has taught the Cypriots, to prefer them to hou&s;es built of &s;tone. They are paved with very &s;oft white marble, which ea&s;ily exfoliates. Every hou&s;e has a garden; the cul|tivation of which, is the principal amu&s;ement of the Cypriots.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="229">Among the private hou&s;es are &s;ome, which, on ac|count of their grandeur, and the richne&s;s of their fur|niture may be con&s;idered as palaces. Such is that of the Engli&s;h con&s;ul: it contains a &s;aloon capable of receiving five hundred people; and is ornamented with ancient tape&s;try, and excellent paintings. All the other apartments equally beautiful, look, for the mo&s;t part, into a delightful garden, kept in excellent order.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es of the Greeks and Turks, are gene|rally pretty large and &s;pacious; but built in a whim|&s;ical &s;tile, and laid out in an irregular manner.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who travel in the Ea&s;t, cannot help ob&s;erv|ing how inferior architecture is there, to what it was formerly. In this art the Orientals produced won|ders. Without mentioning the tower of Babel, the foundations of which, according to an ancient writer, were &s;till exi&s;ting in his time, like a va&s;t mountain, what could be more worthy of admiration than the walls of Babylon, its hanging gardens, and temple of <HI>Belus,</HI> the height of which, divided into eight &s;to|ries, of a furlong each, was con&s;equently a mile; and on the &s;ummit of which was erected the ob&s;erva|tory of this proud city? To which might be added, that immen&s;e rock, cut into the figure of <HI>Semiramis;</HI>
<PB N="227" REF="230">
whil&s;t &s;ome &s;maller ones repre&s;ented tributary kings pro&s;trated before her.</P>
<P>Many learned men have indeed ranked the&s;e won|ders of art among&s;t the fables of antiquity; but their incredulity, in this re&s;pect, is founded upon nothing el&s;e than the impo&s;&s;ibility of erecting &s;uch monuments at pre&s;ent. The ancients certainly enjoyed advan|tages we have not. The earth was exceedingly fer|tile, and the greater part converted into pa&s;tures, which require much fewer hands than agriculture. There was &s;carcely any commerce to employ the active part of mankind; few arts and &s;ciences to en|gage the attention of the &s;edentary and contempla|tive; and be&s;ides this, monarchs were ab&s;olute; and, when they went to war, they put them&s;elves at the head of all their people. We are told, that <HI>Semi|ramis</HI> carried with her three millions of men; and yet &s;he found her&s;elf before an army &s;till more nu|merous. Is it &s;urpri&s;ing then that this queen, on her return from war, as &s;he could with a &s;ingle word, command all that multitude, &s;hould have executed the&s;e wonders of her imagination? In the&s;e climates al&s;o, a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;ea&s;ons was unknown; and winter never fettered the activity of the labourer. Among&s;t other advantages might be reckoned the bitumen; which, according to hi&s;torians, covered the &s;urface of the earth; and this &s;pecies of cement, furni&s;hed
<PB N="228" REF="231">
by nature, is probably the &s;ame which the Scriptures tell us was employed in con&s;tructing the tower of Babel. Do not the pyramids of Egypt corre&s;pond with the de&s;criptions given of them by the ancients? Nor have I the lea&s;t doubt, &s;ays <HI>Mariti,</HI> but that an ingenious traveller might &s;till di&s;cover &s;ome remains of that famous labyrinth which covered a whole province, and which, in its va&s;t circumference, con|tained an hundred temples, di&s;per&s;ed through its different divi&s;ions. The Chine&s;e wall is al&s;o one of tho&s;e con&s;tructions which make a con&s;iderable figure in the &s;cale of human indu&s;try: and were not this monument of oriental grandeur &s;till extant; would it not be cla&s;&s;ed among the number of hi&s;torical fables and chimeras? The doubts &s;tarted re&s;pecting the exi&s;tence of the&s;e prodigies of art, atte&s;t much le&s;s the wi&s;dom of our critici&s;m, than the narrow and confined &s;phere of our modern conceptions.</P>
<P>The water of Larnic was formerly very bad, and the de&s;truction of the ancient aqueducts of critici&s;m was greatly lamented. A ba&s;haw, zealous for the good of the public, cau&s;ed new ones to be con&s;truct|ed; and the&s;e kept in proper repair, continue to di&s;tribute throughout the city, the excellent waters of a &s;pring from the neighbouring village of Arpera.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="232">The city is governed by a Digdaban, or commi&s;&s;ary. This is the &s;econd office of dignity in the i&s;land; and the power of appointing a per&s;on to fill it up, is ve&s;ted in the governor-general.</P>
<P>The pretorian palace is the re&s;idence of the Cadi, and of the pre&s;ident of the Codgias. The&s;e Codgias are virtuous old men, who&s;e coun&s;els are li&s;tened to with attention, and followed with punctuality.</P>
<P>The &s;entences pa&s;&s;ed in this tribunal are only pro|vi&s;ional; but in &s;ome ca&s;es of little con&s;equence, no appeal can be made: in tho&s;e of importance, the af|fair is referred to the tribunal of Nico&s;ia, which de|termines in the la&s;t in&s;tance.</P>
<P>Three hours after &s;un-&s;et, the guard of the culaches, otherwi&s;e called the watch, i&s;&s;ues from the palace of the Digdaban: its bu&s;ine&s;s is to pre&s;erve peace among the inhabitants; and whoever walks abroad at that hour, without a light, is made a pri&s;oner. Subjects of the empire are conducted to the public pri&s;ons; and Europeans to the palace of their con&s;ul: when they have committed no other crime, they are di&s;charged, on paying a &s;mall acknowledgment to the guard.</P>
<P>In the city of Larnic, or rather in the whole king|dom of Cyprus, there are people belonging to &s;ix Eu|ropean
<PB N="230" REF="233">
nations; French, Engli&s;h, Tu&s;cans, Neapo|litans, Venetians, and Ragu&s;ans. Each have their re&s;pective con&s;ul, except the Tu&s;cans; the&s;e are under the protection of the Engli&s;h con&s;ul, who is honoured even with the title of vice-con&s;ul of Tu&s;|cany. There are here al&s;o Imperiali&s;ts, Danes, Swi&s;s, Dutch, and Genoe&s;e. But as all the&s;e have long cea&s;ed to carry on commerce by them&s;elves, they entru&s;t their commi&s;&s;ions to corre&s;pondents; whom they, among the other nations, have e&s;tabli&s;hed in this i&s;land.</P>
<P>In the neighbourhood of this city, are a multitude of ci&s;terns, covered with a vi&s;cous kind of cement, im|penetrable to oil; which were formerly, as it is &s;aid, va&s;t re&s;ervoirs for containing that liquid. This ce|ment, is a mixture of marine &s;alt, lime, and boiling oil.</P>
<P>The country round Larnic is not the mo&s;t plea&s;ant in the i&s;land, the &s;oil being extremely barren. The &s;un falls almo&s;t perpendicular on the&s;e parched fields; and while the fatigued traveller breathes a &s;corching air, he &s;earches in vain for &s;ome grove; the &s;hade of which, may afford him &s;helter to recruit his exhau&s;ted &s;trength. If the fields, however, are dry and barren, the orchards are rich and fruitful; they are remarkably plea&s;ant, and watered by &s;mall canals formed in the earth. The gardens are equally beau|tiful,
<PB N="231" REF="234">
and abound with all kinds of flowers: the citron and the orange-trees thrive in them wonderfully.</P>
<P>Though this i&s;land does not &s;eem to po&s;&s;e&s;s many con&s;iderable cities; according to <HI>Mariti,</HI> it abounds with beautiful villages, &s;ome of which, are almo&s;t as large as towns, and very populous. Among others, he de&s;cribes in glowing terms, the village of Pi&s;copia, near the ancient Cythera. This village, &s;ays he, is one of the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing places in Cyprus. It abounds in citron, orange, and olive-trees; the trees are watered by a multitude of &s;prings, and the &s;cenery around is delightful. The plea&s;antne&s;s of the abode &s;eems, as it were, to have been transfu&s;ed into the &s;ouls of the inhabitants, who are &s;prightlier, and more ami|able than in any other part of the kingdom. They have lively imaginations, which renders their conver|&s;ation mo&s;t agreeable; they paint, rather than &s;peak; and their compari&s;ons like that nature, which furni&s;hes them with images, breathes an air of delicacy and grace.</P>
<P>Dale, another village to the South of Nico&s;ia, is like|wi&s;e de&s;cribed by <HI>Mariti,</HI> in animated terms. This vil|lage, &s;ays he, is delightfully &s;ituated on an eminence; and is rendered &s;till more plea&s;ant by the vicinity of a number of &s;mall groves. Its waters are remarkably limpid; and the banks are ornamented with a thou|&s;and
<PB N="232" REF="235">
odoriferous herbs; which enamel the plains, and diffu&s;e an agreeable fragrance throughout the &s;ur|rounding atmo&s;phere. Sweet marjoram, is above all, very common. This plant, and the &s;pot where it grows, are elegantly introduced by <HI>Virgil,</HI> in that charming picture he gives, of innocence repo&s;ing peacefully in the bo&s;om of beauty, in a rural and &s;olemn retreat. Dale, was formerly called Idalicum, and one of the four villages con&s;ecrated to the god|de&s;s <HI>Venus,</HI> as &s;he her&s;elf &s;ays, in the tenth book of the Aeneid.</P>

<P>HAVING now furni&s;hed the cities, towns, and villages in this i&s;land; we will proceed to the people, their character, cu&s;toms, manners, and amu&s;e|ments. With re&s;pect to their per&s;ons, the Cypriots are, in general, tall and well-made; they have al&s;o a noble and agreeable air; and, in their manner of living,
<FIGURE>
<PB REF="236">
<HEAD>CYPRIOTS.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="237" REF="237">
are very &s;ober and temperate. The women, &s;ays <HI>Mariti,</HI> have nothing beautiful but their eyes; their features are de&s;titute of delicacy; yet they have always been held in the highe&s;t e&s;timation for their charms; and it is from among them, that our writers of love-&s;ongs &s;elect their models: but it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the European ladies have no occa&s;ion to be proud of the compari&s;on, few of them being remarkable for their beauty. In &s;tature, they are like the men; very tall, of an amorous di&s;po&s;ition, and much inclined to indolence and voluptuou&s;ne&s;s. They, for the mo&s;t part, attain to a good old age; and it is no uncom|mon thing to &s;ee great grandmothers become tired of widowhood, and enter again into the bands of Hymen. All the Greeks are fond of plea&s;ure; but the Cypriots give them&s;elves up to a degree of licentiou&s;ne&s;s and con&s;ider the gratifying of their inclinations as an act of religion.</P>
<P>The people of this i&s;land, dre&s;s nearly in the &s;ame manner as the inhabitants of Con&s;tantinople. The ladies are di&s;tingui&s;hed by nothing but their light and lofty head-dre&s;s. This is a very ancient fa&s;hion, and has hitherto been pre&s;erved in the i&s;land. Their dre&s;s, according to the Cyprian ta&s;te, is much clo&s;er than that u&s;ed by the Turks; and con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;mall ve&s;t, and a petticoat of red cotton cloth. Their robe is of cloth velvet, or &s;ilk: it is a long piece of &s;tuff pro|ceeding
<PB N="234" REF="238">
from the &s;houlders, which pa&s;&s;es below the arms, and hangs down to the ground. It does not meet before, and leaves that part of the body entirely uncovered. Their &s;hifts are of &s;ilk, and manufactured in the kingdom. They wear breeches, or a kind of drawers; and to half boots, of yellow leather, are fixed, towards the ancle, &s;andals, which &s;erve them for &s;hoes. They have no &s;tays; a plain ve&s;t of cot|ton marks out their &s;hape, and pre&s;erves the pliable|ne&s;s of the body. Over the whole, is thrown a very fine &s;hift, or light veil, with which their mode&s;ty is not contented; and to which, they add one made of &s;ome kind of &s;tuff, le&s;s delicate and tran&s;parent. Around their necks, they have gold chains; and their arms are ornamented with pearls and jewels. Their head-dre&s;s, is an a&s;&s;emblage of beautiful printed mu&s;|lin handkerchiefs, arranged &s;o, as to form &s;omething like a helmet; to the extremities of which, they affix another handkerchief folded into the &s;hape of a tri|angle, and &s;uffered to float over the &s;houlders. This kind of helmet, rai&s;es them a foot and a half, and gives them a theatrical and gigantic appearance. The&s;e pyramidical head-dre&s;&s;es, &s;o fa&s;hionable in this i&s;land, offend again&s;t ta&s;te and good &s;en&s;e. The head of it&s;elf, is the ma&s;ter-piece of nature; and the&s;e foreign ornaments de&s;troy its effect: it occupies the highe&s;t and mo&s;t con&s;picuous part of the human
<PB N="235" REF="239">
figure. Nature has omitted nothing that could em|belli&s;h the face; &s;he has &s;pread over it a fre&s;h and delicate complexion; and rendered it &s;till more &s;trik|ing, by the beautiful enamel of two rows of teeth. She has made it the &s;eat of &s;miles and mode&s;ty. The brilliant &s;en&s;e of &s;eeing animates, and enlivens the &s;cene. On each &s;ide are &s;u&s;pended, the organs of hearing; and the lea&s;t motion in the human body, becomes the agreeable &s;ource of enchanting ex|pre&s;&s;ion. She has given it attitudes, graces, and mo|tions; of which, words can convey but an imperfect idea. The hair hangs over it; and, like a floating &s;hade, &s;ets off its beauty to admiration. In &s;hort, &s;he has imprinted in it, the &s;eal of perfection; and the head &s;erves, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, as a cupola to the mo&s;t elegant of her works. To overload it, there|fore, with &s;uperfluous and prepo&s;terous ornaments, is to de&s;troy its admirable proportion; and &s;ub&s;titute, in the places of real beauties, childi&s;h and ridiculous toys. Among the Cyprian ladies, the greater part of the hair is concealed under the&s;e ornaments; they, however, divide it on the forehead, and extend it over each temple towards the ears. Behind, they &s;uffer it to fall in ringlets; and tho&s;e who have a great quantity, form it into eight or ten tre&s;&s;es. They are pa&s;&s;ionately fond of perfumes, e&s;pecially on the head, which they cover with all kinds of flowers. The ca|tholic ladies in the i&s;land, are remarkably coquetti&s;h,
<PB N="236" REF="240">
and take great pains to di&s;play the elegance of their dre&s;s; their eyes &s;eem to invite adulation; and the opinion they form of tho&s;e around them, is decided by their &s;lowne&s;s, or readine&s;s to gratify their de&s;ires.</P>
<P>The character of this people, and the ideas they &s;eem to have formed of love, is different from that of European nations. That ec&s;tacy and delirium, that union of &s;ouls, which leads us into a kind of intoxica|tion, which deifies in our eyes, the object of our af|fections, and renders love a divine emotion, and an indi&s;&s;oluble chain, is never known here. All the dif|ferent &s;hades of &s;en&s;ibility e&s;cape them. They feel nothing of the moral influence of love; and are ac|quainted only with its unbridled fury: it is a want which they gratify, and not a &s;entiment which hurries them away. A European always embelli&s;hes the object whom he loves; and every day, and every mo|ment, di&s;covers in her new charms, and new graces; he multiplies them, as one may &s;ay, and experiences, even in con&s;tancy, all the plea&s;ures of variety. Such is love, in temperate regions, where the two powers of which man is formed, are in harmony; and where the phy&s;ical &s;en&s;ation is &s;ubordinate to the moral &s;en|timent. But, in tho&s;e countries, where the irre&s;i&s;tible, and continual action of a &s;corching atmo&s;phere, de&s;troys the harmony of the&s;e two powers; the violence of
<PB N="237" REF="241">
the &s;en&s;ation, extingui&s;hes the energy of the &s;enti|ment; and man yields to the mo&s;t impetuous of pa&s;|&s;ions, and not to the milde&s;t of affections.</P>
<P>As an in&s;tance of debauchery of manners in this i&s;land, <HI>Mariti</HI> mentions, the adoration paid by the women to the Abdales. The&s;e are pious vagabonds, or a &s;ect of Turki&s;h monks, who wander from one town to another, without any fixed re&s;idence. No &s;ooner has an Abdale arrived in any town, than all the women go to vi&s;it him; they flock round him, and even make frequent a&s;&s;ignations with him, without the lea&s;t &s;cruple; and &s;ome even do not blu&s;h to &s;ub|mit to his de&s;ires in the middle of the &s;treets, while a &s;imple cloak conceals from view, tho&s;e &s;uper&s;titious orgies; re&s;embling in this re&s;pect, according to <HI>Bruce,</HI> the inhabitants of Aby&s;&s;inia; who, like the Cypriots in their amours, &s;eem lo&s;t to all &s;en&s;e of mode&s;ty.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now give a de&s;cription of a Cyprian hunting match; which, though chiefly remarkable for the extra|ordinary di&s;cipline of the dogs, may not be di&s;plea&s;ing to many of our readers. We have already remarked, the Cypriots are remarkably fond of hunting. Gal|lantry, hunting, and the cultivation of their gardens, &s;eem to con&s;titute the whole of their amu&s;ements. A &s;port&s;man, however, in this i&s;land, &s;eldom goes out alone, to pur&s;ue a feeble animal with his fu&s;ee, and a
<PB N="238" REF="242">
couple of dogs. The Cypriots love exerci&s;e; but they wi&s;h to enliven their excur&s;ions, with jollity and mirth: they, therefore, go in large parties, mounted on hor&s;es, and accompanied by whole packs of dogs. The hunting match, at which I was pre&s;ent, &s;ays <HI>Mariti,</HI> was a very brilliant one, it being that of the governor. On our arrival in a &s;pacious plain, inter|&s;per&s;ed with clumps of mulberry-trees, &s;ome ruins, and thick bu&s;hes, the &s;port&s;men began to form a ring in order to enclo&s;e the enemy. The barrier con&s;i&s;ted of guards placed on hor&s;eback, with dogs in the in|tervals. The ladies of the greate&s;t di&s;tinction in Ni|co&s;ia, with a multitude of other people, &s;tood on a little hill, which I al&s;o a&s;cended; and from that emi|nence enjoyed the amu&s;ement, without &s;haring in the fatigue. The governor and his &s;uite were po&s;ted in different parts of the plain; and, as &s;oon as the ap|pointed moment arrived, the hunt was opened with the &s;ound of mu&s;ical in&s;truments. Part of the dogs were then loo&s;ened; which, ranging through the bu&s;hes and underwood, &s;prang a great number of rails, par|tridges, and woodcocks. The governor began the &s;port, by bringing down one of the&s;e birds; his &s;uite followed his example; and the winged tribe, into whatever quarter they flew, were &s;ure of meeting in&s;tant death. I was &s;truck with the tranquillity of the &s;ta|tionary dogs; for, notwith&s;tanding the in&s;tinct with which they were naturally &s;purred on, not one of
<PB N="239" REF="243">
them quitted his po&s;t; but the re&s;t ran about in pur|&s;uit of the game, and the plain was cleared in an in|&s;tant. The &s;cene now changed; a hare &s;tarted from a bu&s;h; the dogs pur&s;ued; and, while &s;he made a thou|&s;and turnings to avoid her enemy, they met her at every point. She, however, often defeated the grey|hounds; and I could not but admire the &s;agacity of the&s;e animals, which, di&s;daining the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e which were young and inexperienced, waited until &s;ome of the cunning old ones opened the way for them, and then the whole plain was in motion. During this &s;cene, the beauty of the &s;ea&s;on, the cheerfulne&s;s with which I was &s;urrounded, the barking of the dogs re-echoed a thou&s;and times from the hills, the cries of the hunters, and the &s;ound of the horns, exalted my imagination; and kept me, I may &s;ay, in a kind of en|chantment. When the poor animal was ju&s;t going to be a prey to his enemies, the governor ru&s;hed for|wards, and throwing a &s;tick before the dogs, they all in&s;tantly &s;topped, and not one of them ventured to pa&s;s the &s;ignal. One of the &s;wift greyhounds being then let loo&s;e, pur&s;ued the hare, and having come up with it, carried it back; and, jumping on the neck of the governor's hor&s;e, placed it before him. The go|vernor took it in his arms; and gave orders if it con|continued alive, to &s;hut it up in his park, where he maintained many other pri&s;oners taken in the &s;ame
<PB N="240" REF="244">
way. Such was the humanity of this governor, a Turk, who thought it his duty to pre&s;erve an animal, which had afforded him &s;o much amu&s;ement.</P>

<P>RELIGIONS are very much diver&s;ified in this i&s;land: the Turks never carried their tyranny &s;o far, as to attempt to render theirs univer&s;al. Had this moderation been adopted by all &s;overeigns, it would have &s;aved abundance of human blood, and not have &s;o frequently placed a greater di&s;tance between the members of the &s;ame nation, than is to be found between people &s;eparated by immen&s;e &s;eas, or inac|ce&s;&s;ible mountains. The greater part of the inhabi|tants are Greek &s;chi&s;matics. Be&s;ides a multitude of Armenians, there are here a great many Maronites; who&s;e religious cu&s;toms, differ little from tho&s;e of the Roman catholics. The Latins are far from being &s;o
<PB N="241" REF="245">
numerous, and con&s;i&s;t only of Europeans, and the brotherhood of St. <HI>Francis,</HI> known throughout the Levant, under the name of the fathers of the Holy Land.</P>
<P>The Turks here have a mullah, who is al&s;o in &s;ome mea&s;ure the chief of the law; the Greeks, an arch|bi&s;hop, and three bi&s;hops; the Arminians, a bi&s;hop; the Maronites, a high-prie&s;t; and the Latins, two rectors; one for the French, and the other for the Italians. Religious toleration in this i&s;land, is ex|tended to all nations.</P>
<P>There are very few Engli&s;h in it; and doubtle&s;s it is, for this rea&s;on, that they have neither a church, a chapel, or a mini&s;ter of their religion. Should they happen to multiply, they will endeavour to procure all the&s;e things. Here, as el&s;ewhere, it is known that man is by excellence, a religious being; and that re|ligion is the &s;tronge&s;t bond which attaches a people to their &s;overeign, by exhibiting him as the repre&s;enta|tive of the Deity. We have &s;poken pretty fully of the Mahometan wor&s;hip, under the article of religion in Turkey; we &s;hall, however, offer &s;ome &s;trictures from <HI>Mariti,</HI> on their mode of preaching in Cyprus.</P>
<P>Were we to judge of their di&s;cour&s;es from ours, we &s;hould form a very fal&s;e idea of them. The Mu&s;&s;ul|man's
<PB N="242" REF="246">
eloquence, admits nothing of the common place kind. Le&s;s diffu&s;e, and le&s;s ornamented than the Eu|ropean oratory, every foreign idea, and every u&s;ele&s;s expre&s;&s;ion, are carefully bani&s;hed from it. A Turki&s;h &s;ermon, is a continued &s;eries of maxims and &s;enten|ces. The mini&s;ter never attempts to prove dogma's, which no one doubts; nor does he ever addre&s;s him|&s;elf to the audience as to unbelievers. Morality is the ba&s;is of their di&s;cour&s;es, which contain regulations for conduct, in every circum&s;tance of life, and con|&s;olation for every kind of misfortune to which men may be expo&s;ed. The per&s;on of the orator, is as &s;imple as his di&s;cour&s;e; and the profligacy of his con|duct, never de&s;troys the beauty of his morality. A young voluptuary, is never &s;een declaiming again&s;t effeminacy and plea&s;ure; an opulent dignitary, preaching the contempt of riches; or an elegant beau, &s;atyri&s;ing vice and luxury. The&s;e ridiculous contra&s;ts, &s;o common, and yet &s;o little taken notice of in Europe, would highly offend the&s;e people who are fond of &s;implicity: they would believe, one ridiculed both them and their religion; and the latter is an object upon which a good Mu&s;&s;ulman will never &s;uffer raillery.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Cyprus, was for a long time go|verned by a bachan; but when the i&s;land began to lo&s;e its ancient &s;plendor, its expences became exce&s;&s;ive,
<PB N="243" REF="247">
and the people were &s;o oppre&s;&s;ed by taxes, that they complained of this burthen, and begged the Ottoman Porte to give them, in&s;tead of a ba&s;haw, a <HI>muha&s;&s;il,</HI> or &s;imple governor. This reque&s;t was complied with; but the Cypriots, by changing ma&s;ters, were not freed from oppre&s;&s;ion; and, being equally harra&s;&s;ed under the muha&s;&s;il, they again complained, and petitioned for a ba&s;haw. All their &s;upplications were, however, u&s;ele&s;s; and they &s;till continue to groan under a yoke they once thought le&s;s &s;evere, and le&s;s burthen-&s;ome.</P>
<P>The revenues of the kingdom, are abandoned to the Grand Vizier, who farms them to the highe&s;t bid|der. The purcha&s;er, furni&s;hed with a &s;pecial man|date from the Grand Signior, counter&s;igned by the mini&s;ter, arrives in his government; and, like the clouds that precede tempe&s;ts, and conceal all tho&s;e &s;courges that de&s;olate our plains; the pre&s;ence of this &s;ubaltern de&s;pot, impre&s;&s;es univer&s;al terror, and pre|&s;ages every evil.</P>
<P>If intere&s;t be here, as it really is, the &s;ure path to preferment; it is al&s;o the only rule, which regulates the actions of the great. There is nothing to check the&s;e avaricious governors. They fall on the people with fury; and their &s;ubtle tyranny invents a thou|&s;and means to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their wealth, and ex|tort
<PB N="244" REF="248">
from them the fruits of their indu&s;try. Every day gives birth to &s;ome new tax; and the governor, after having fattened on the &s;ub&s;tance of the people &mdash;after having enriched the agents of his cruelty, and become the object of public execration; retires loaded with gold, and maledictions, and gives place to a new purcha&s;er; who, to make him&s;elf amends for a bad bargain, thinks, that he is entitled to exerci&s;e equal rapacity, and oppre&s;&s;ion. The con&s;equence is, that this beautiful kingdom is reduced to the mo&s;t de|plorable condition, and drained of all its &s;pecie. In no country whatever, are taxes more accumulated. Altogether, they amount to about two hundred pia&s;|tres, for each citizen. Capitation, throughout the whole Turki&s;h empire, is forty pia&s;tres; and it was only by a &s;pecial favour, that it was here reduced to twenty-one.</P>
<P>Gold here, is the univer&s;al agent; and every thing is purcha&s;ed by it, &s;ays <HI>Mariti,</HI> even to the blood of the citizens. The law, it is true, orders an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in to be put to death; but the criminal, by paying a few hundred pia&s;tres, ea&s;ily avoids its vengeance. The fine for murdering a man, between thirty and thirty-five years of age, is five hundred pia&s;tres.</P>
<P>The tribunals to which all civil and criminal ca&s;es are referred, are called Mehemes. The pre&s;ident of
<PB N="245" REF="249">
the&s;e tribunals is, in the capital, a mullah; and, in towns, or large villages, a cadi.</P>
<P>The military government of the i&s;land, is in the hands of the ali-bey, a general of the cavalry; and the aga-jani&s;&s;ary, commandant of the infantry. Their re&s;pective captains are called, zaim, and cioluagini. There ought to be three thou&s;and hor&s;es in the i&s;land, and about eight thou&s;and jani&s;&s;aries; but there are &s;carce ever more than an hundred of the former, and two thou&s;and of the latter. The pay, however, is always the &s;ame, and is received by the commanders.</P>
<P>When the Turks conquered Cyprus, they reckoned in it be&s;ides women, children, and old people, &s;eventy thou&s;and men, &s;ubject to capitation. Such was always the number of its inhabitants, in the &s;hort mo|ments of its &s;plendor and glory. But, de&s;poti&s;m hav|ing over-run this rich i&s;land, its &s;ources of abundance are dried up, and its population is &s;o much decrea&s;ed, that the number of inhabitants &s;carce amount to forty thou&s;and. This calculation is, perhaps, not very ac|curate; it being difficult to a&s;certain the exact num|ber of inhabitants, either in Cyprus, or in any coun|tries of the Levant. The Orientals do not, like the Europeans, keep a regi&s;ter of births and deaths; no notion, therefore, can be formed of this population, but, from the number of tho&s;e paying taxes, and who are not above a third part of the whole.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXXVI.</HI> Commerce of Cyprus, and its Wines.</HEAD>
<P>THE three principal articles of commerce, in the i&s;land of Cyprus, are cotton, &s;ilk, and wine. The cotton, on account of its whitene&s;s, &s;oftne&s;s, and the length of its filaments, is accounted the be&s;t in the whole Levant. The high price at which it &s;ells, is a &s;ufficient proof of its &s;uperiority over every other kind u&s;ed in Europe, and of the intrin&s;ic value of this &s;taple commodity of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>The &s;ea&s;on of &s;owing this plant, is the month of April. The ground de&s;tined for the reception of the &s;eed, is prepared much in the &s;ame manner as that for corn. As &s;oon as the plants appear above ground, the weake&s;t are pulled up, and none left but tho&s;e which are &s;trong and vigorous. The crops are col|lected in the months of October and November; and, as &s;ome time is nece&s;&s;ary before the &s;eed can be freed from its cover, or hu&s;k, the fir&s;t exportation does not
<PB N="247" REF="251">
take place till February or March, in the year fol|lowing.</P>
<P>It is accounted a good crop, when the whole pro|duce of the kingdom amounts to five thou&s;and bags. About half a century ago, the i&s;land produced eight thou&s;and; and, under the government of the Vene|tians, thirty thou&s;and.</P>
<P>Silk, is another important branch of the commerce, of the i&s;land of Cyprus. The method of breeding &s;ilk-worms here, is almo&s;t the &s;ame as that employed in Italy; but, it is not &s;ubject in Cyprus, to tho&s;e in|conveniences which ari&s;e from a variation of the at|mo&s;phere; the &s;ea&s;on at that epoch, being always beautiful and favourable. The quality of the &s;ilk, depends on the places where it is collected. The fine&s;t and white&s;t, is that produced in the environs of Famagu&s;ta and Carpa&s;&s;ia. The orange, and &s;ulphur-coloured, is made in Cythera, or the villages beyond the northern mountains; and that of a gold-yellow colour is produced in the territories of Paphos, and the adjacent country. The Turks purcha&s;e the greater part of the orange-coloured &s;ilk, for which they pay a pia&s;tre more, and &s;end it to Cairo. The people there, are remarkably fond of this colour; and the &s;ilk, be|&s;ides, is capable of being &s;pun into much finer and more delicate threads. This i&s;land produces, one
<PB N="248" REF="252">
year with another, twenty-five thou&s;and bags of &s;ilk.</P>
<P>The whole quantity of the be&s;t wines, made annually in Cyprus, amounts to forty thou&s;and jars, or ten thou&s;and barrels, Italian mea&s;ure. Each jar contains five bottles, Florence mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The principal part of the wine trade, is carried on with the Venetians; for the wines of Cyprus, are drank at Venice, even in the Coffee-hou&s;es. The&s;e people, however, are not the nice&s;t in their choice; &s;ince the wine which they purcha&s;e, is never above eighteen months old; the price, con&s;equently, is very low, being never more than a pia&s;tre a jar. A pia&s;tre, according to <HI>Mariti,</HI> does not amount to quite three &s;hillings, Engli&s;h. Other writers, make it equivalent to four &s;hillings. The wines exported to other coun|tries, are from five to &s;ix years old.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t all the wines on the i&s;land, are &s;ent to Lar|nic; which, in all the ports of the Levant, is known to be the grand magazine for this commodity. They are tran&s;ported in leather bags; and as they &s;erve to hold indifferent as well as good wines, they are pitched with very little attention.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="253">Hence ari&s;es that pitchy &s;mell, ob&s;erved in the new wines of Cyprus; which might be much le&s;s, were care employed in pitching the &s;kins: as a proof of this, it may be remarked, that in the country where the ve&s;&s;els are better prepared; the wines have not the &s;ame &s;trong &s;mell, as tho&s;e tran&s;ported to the city.</P>
<P>After it has been kept &s;ome time, it begins to lo&s;e its pitchy &s;mell; and when it has attained to the age of twelve or fifteen years, it lo&s;es it entirely.</P>
<P>Subterranean cellars are not known at Larnic. The cellars there, are all above ground, and very long and narrow. The ca&s;ks are placed upon joi&s;ts, or on &s;mall walls, rai&s;ed about a hand's breadth from the ground. The&s;e cellars are called <HI>kilaw;</HI> and it is not thought of any importance, in re&s;pect to the qua|lity of the wine, to build them towards any one point of the horizon more than to another. They have very little light; and the openings that admit it, are con&s;tructed in the extremity, oppo&s;ite to the pa&s;&s;age; on each &s;ide of which the ca&s;ks are ranged. They are never opened, but when it is nece&s;&s;ary to perform &s;ome operation on the wine. New wine, when taken from the &s;kins, is put into earthern ve&s;&s;els, and not removed into ca&s;ks, till after the expiration of a year.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="254">It is for the mo&s;t part cu&s;tomary, not to fill each ca&s;k entirely; a certain vacuum is left in them; and if they were only half full, the wine would &s;u&s;tain no injury.</P>
<P>Cyprus wine does not leave, on the &s;ides of the ve&s;&s;el in which it is contained, that calcareous brilliant cru&s;t, which we call tartar. It, however, depo&s;its at the bottom a certain &s;ediment, which partakes of a black, red, and yellow colour; and which, in drying, acquires the con&s;i&s;tence of a &s;oft pa&s;te, and a&s;&s;umes the colour of Spani&s;h &s;nuff.</P>
<P>The price of the be&s;t wines, is generally from two to three pia&s;tres; that of new wines, or tho&s;e made within the cour&s;e of a year, is, as we have before ob|&s;erved, only one pia&s;tre. They have al&s;o an ordinary wine, which is never more than a quarter of a pia&s;tre, per jar; and in many villages, not above half that &s;um.</P>
<P><HI>Strabo,</HI> the geographer, de&s;cribing the i&s;land of Cyprus; in the end of his relation, pa&s;&s;es a high en|comium on its wines.</P>
<P><HI>Pliny,</HI> the naturali&s;t, reckons them among the mo&s;t valuable wines of the earth.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="255">The vineyards of Cyprus, &s;ays <HI>Gregory le Grand,</HI> are the mo&s;t fertile of all tho&s;e that I know; and their wines, which are in great reque&s;t in all commercial countries, are a &s;ure &s;ource of riches.</P>
<P><HI>Aponius</HI> admires the &s;ize of the grapes; the abun|dant and delicate juice of which, perfumes the mouth.</P>
<P>One is &s;urprized to read, in a relation printed at Bologna, in 1572; that <HI>Selim</HI> II. emperor of the Turks, without re&s;pecting the <HI>talim,</HI> went to conquer Cyprus, in order that he might be ma&s;ter of its wines.</P>
<P>This prince, had wa&s;ted his youth, in the effeminacy and debauchery of the &s;eraglio; and the laurels of his predece&s;&s;ors, appeared to him objects of contempt, rather than envy; as being too dearly purcha&s;ed by the fatigues and dangers of arms. A que&s;tion, how|ever, put to him, by one of his women, changed in an in&s;tant his pacific di&s;po&s;ition. Some excellent Cyprus wine, with which the favourite was not acquainted, being &s;erved up to them, during a voluptuous repa&s;t; &s;he found it &s;o delicious, that &s;he a&s;ked <HI>Selim</HI> from what place he had procured it, and whether the for|tunate &s;oil that produced it, was contained within the va&s;t extent of his empire. The &s;ultan finding him&s;elf humbled by this que&s;tion, &s;uddenly quitted his new
<PB N="252" REF="256">
favourite; and having convoked his council, appointed <HI>Piali,</HI> admiral of his gallies; and <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> genera|li&s;&s;imo of his forces; and gave orders for all his troops to be a&s;&s;embled, and hold them&s;elves in readine&s;s to receive his commands. "I propo&s;e," &s;aid he, "to conquer Cyprus; an i&s;land which contains a trea&s;ure, that none but the king of kings ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>This expedition is de&s;cribed, in a very intere&s;ting manner, by father <HI>Angelo,</HI> of the order of St. Domi|nic, and vicar-general of the Holy Land. He re|&s;ided at Cyprus, at the time when Nico&s;ia was taken.</P>
<P>We are almo&s;t tempted to &s;mile, when we find <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> hi&s;torians telling us, that <HI>Selim</HI> undertook this enter|prize, from motives of glory.</P>
<P>Another monk, called <HI>Stephen Lu&s;ignan,</HI> who was al&s;o a witne&s;s to the defeat of the Cypriots, in &s;ome mea&s;ure confirms this fact, which we have related. He &s;ays, that the Ottomans having in their re|&s;earches, di&s;covered &s;ome wine eighty years old, &s;ent it with great care to the &s;eraglio, as the mo&s;t valuable part of the booty. The&s;e wines were re&s;erved for the &s;ick; and to give an idea of their quality, father <HI>Stephen,</HI> tells us, that they kindled in the fire like oil.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="257">There is no longer any of the&s;e wines in Cyprus. The olde&s;t that can be found, are tho&s;e pre&s;erved under ground in earthen ve&s;&s;els; their age, in gene|ral, does not exceed twenty, or twenty-five years; and there would be none even &s;o old, were it not for the cu&s;tom which the Chri&s;tians have, at burying one of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, at the birth of each child, to be &s;erved up afterwards at their marriage. This wine, whatever may be the fate of the child, is never em|ployed in commerce.</P>
<P>I do not know, &s;ays <HI>Mariti,</HI> what may have been the properties of tho&s;e wines, eighty years old; which were formerly very common in the i&s;land; but I can a&s;&s;ert, that tho&s;e kept at pre&s;ent for twenty years, cure &s;everal di&s;ea&s;es; and even &s;ome that are inveterate, as I my&s;elf have experienced.</P>
<P>Having been attacked for two months with a ter|tian ague, which degenerated into a quartan, I was beginning to de&s;pair of my condition, when a Cypriot, whom I accidently &s;aw, made me acquainted with the remedy u&s;ually employed in &s;uch ca&s;es; which is only a gla&s;s of old wine, drank when the fit encrea&s;es. Having followed this pre&s;cription, I &s;oon fell a&s;leep; and when I awakened, I found my&s;elf perfectly well, and was never troubled more with the di&s;order. Such cures belong to the marvelous, no doubt; but they are,
<PB N="254" REF="258">
neverthele&s;s, true; and appear very &s;imple to the Cypriots.</P>
<P>Cyprus wine is al&s;o employed, with equal &s;ucce&s;s, for clean&s;ing wounds. If a rag is dipped in a gla&s;s full of this wine, and applied to the injured part, it becomes a &s;alutary balm; which does not fail &s;oon to heal the wound, and cau&s;e it to clo&s;e entirely.</P>
<P>The&s;e wines are not equally good at every &s;ea&s;on of the year. If the &s;pring and &s;ummer are favour|able to them, the winter is prejudicial to them in cold countries; they appear then, to have lo&s;t all delicacy and flavour. On this account, connoi&s;&s;eurs take the precaution to place them near the fire before they are drank.</P>
<P>In warm weather it is of utility, towards their pre|&s;ervation, to put them into cool cellars. As every place &s;uits them equally; they will keep as well on a wooden, as on an earthen floor.</P>
<P>By pouring Cyprus wine from the bottle, it may be ea&s;ily known whether it be old. When certain oily particles are found adherent to the gla&s;s, it is a &s;ign of age: wine clarified by art, is too much enervated to produce that effect. It is not &s;o ea&s;y to determine whether it be genuine, becau&s;e it may be adulterated
<PB N="255" REF="259">
a thou&s;and different ways; the mo&s;t u&s;ual is, to mix it with mu&s;cadines and perfumes. To prevent any fraud in this re&s;pect, nothing is better, than to learn from what part it comes, and never to purcha&s;e but from merchants of known probity.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXXVII.</HI> Of the modern Greeks, their Character, Manners, Cu&s;toms, Dre&s;s, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>A Greek gentleman is, without doubt, the mo&s;t haughty and conceited being in the univer&s;e. Tho&s;e men, who by their birth or fortune, hold the fir&s;t rank among the Greeks, are called kings; as the women, who excel in beauty, are denominated queens. The kings of ancient Greece were &s;o numerous, in|con&s;iderable, and vain, that during the reign of the emperors, the nobility might well &s;tile them&s;elves kings; which title they accordingly a&s;&s;umed, and it remains with them to this day. Anciently the &s;ame
<PB N="256" REF="260">
appellation was given to the powerful and the rich. <HI>Horace</HI> calls them the &s;overeigns of the earth. <HI>Terence,</HI> in conformity to the Greek language, gives to all the ladies of a certain rank, the title of queens. "Not|with&s;tanding your rank and your income, you may pretend what you will, &s;ays <HI>Martial</HI> to <HI>Maximus,</HI> we are equal. I &s;up with you, you &s;upped with &s;ome one el&s;e la&s;t night. I am coming to pay my court to you this morning, you have already done &s;o before me. I accompany you as my patron and king, and you likewi&s;e attend in the <HI>&s;uite</HI> of another. But it is enough to be a client, without being the proud &s;er|vant of any one. He who can be king in his own hou&s;e, does not &s;tand in need of another."</P>
<P>The Greeks, ever vain and ambitious, give more commonly the title of <HI>archondas,</HI> and <HI>archondi&s;a;</HI> that is, of prince and prince&s;s, to tho&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed by their rank or opulence. This word comes from the Greek word <HI>archo&s;e,</HI> which &s;ignifies a prince. The archers at Athens, &s;ucceeded the &s;overeigns; the &s;econd bore the name of king; and that of archon, has been &s;ince given to the fir&s;t lords of the emperor's court. From hence the title of archondas is taken up by &s;uch, among the modern Greeks, as pretend to a &s;upe|riority over the re&s;t of the people.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="261">There are no chimnies in the Greek hou&s;es. A brazier is made u&s;e of to heat the apartments, and for tho&s;e per&s;ons, to warm them&s;elves by, who are cold. This cu&s;tom is very ancient all over the Ea&s;t; the Romans had no other, and the Turks have pre|&s;erved it. The brazier was placed in the middle of the apartment, and dry wood burned in it, with torches to give light: it was placed, as at pre&s;ent, upon a tripod; lamps did not come in u&s;e till long after.</P>
<P>To protect the face from the inconvenience and heat of the brazier, the <HI>tendour</HI> was invented: this is a &s;quare table, under which the fire is placed, and is covered with a carpet, which reaches to the ground; over this is thrown a &s;ilk covering, more or le&s;s va|luable, round which the company &s;it, either on a &s;opha, or on the carpet. This uten&s;il is chiefly in u&s;e among the ladies, who in winter &s;it near it the whole day, occupied in embroiderings, and receiv|ing the vi&s;its of their friends.</P>
<P>Embroidery is the chief occupation of the Greek women, they go out but little, and tho&s;e that are obliged to labour for the &s;upport of their families, like our &s;pinners, work from morning to night, to|gether with their children and their &s;laves. The pic|ture
<PB N="258" REF="262">
of the indu&s;trious woman in <HI>Virgil</HI>'s eighth book of his Aeneid, is an exact copy after nature.</P>
<P>I have been, &s;ays <HI>Guys,</HI> an eye-witne&s;s of this liv|ing picture. The lamp of a female embroiderer, my neighbour, was lighted before day-break; and all her young maidens were &s;eated early at their work, and enlivened their labour with &s;ongs.</P>
<P>We are indebted to the Greeks, for the art of em|broidery, which is of very ancient date, and was car|ried by them to the utmo&s;t degree of perfection. The Cretans, particularly, excelled in this art. When the talents of a young &s;lave were mentioned by the ancients, to be &s;kilful in embroidery was all that was requi&s;ite; they worked then as they do at pre&s;ent, in the apartments with their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P><HI>Agamemnon,</HI> di&s;puting the fair <HI>Chri&s;eis,</HI> with <HI>Achilles,</HI> &s;ays, I &s;hould prefer her even to <HI>Clitemne&s;tres,</HI> the queen; nor is &s;he inferior to her, either in beauty, in wit, or in her &s;kilfulne&s;s at all kinds of embroi|deries.</P>
<P>The ladies of the highe&s;t rank prepared the wool for embroidering them&s;elves, and had no other oc|cupation.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="263">The Trojan women, when their town was be&s;ieged, &s;eized with a rage for fighting, wi&s;hed to lay a&s;ide their &s;pindles, and embroidery, in order to take up arms. The prudent <HI>Theano</HI> &s;tops them, and &s;ays, "Return home, I entreat you, and re&s;ume your em|broidery, and other &s;uch like occupations; and confide to men, the ta&s;k of driving away the Greeks, and pro|tecting you."</P>
<P><HI>Homer</HI> is frequent, in his eulogium on the Grecian embroideries. <HI>Antinous</HI> &s;ays, he pre&s;ented to <HI>Penelope</HI> a mantle; the embroidery of which was very elegant; and the colours variegated with great art and &s;kill.</P>
<P>What the &s;ame poet &s;ays, of the veils embroidered by <HI>Helen</HI> and <HI>Andromache,</HI> has given ri&s;e to a di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion, whether the&s;e embroideries were embo&s;&s;ed. Although this art has made great progre&s;s, by &s;eeing what was done now; &s;ome conjecture may be made of what was done in ancient times. I do not think, with the author, of the <HI>origin of laws,</HI> that they had re|cour&s;e to painted patterns. The de&s;ign was drawn as it is at pre&s;ent, upon the &s;ilk, or linen; and the em|broiderer &s;haded it with her wool, of different colours: nature being the great model. The embroidery at fir&s;t, imitated the mo&s;t &s;imple flowers, of one or two co|lours; and, by degrees, tho&s;e that were more varie|gated. Figures, and a mixture of &s;hades, were intro|duced

in proportion, as the art of dying colours, and working them, were brought to perfection. It is cer|tain, that all the women in Greece embroidered; and that the men deemed it an honour to wear the gar|ments that had been worked by them.</P>
<P><HI>Quintus Curtius,</HI> in his hi&s;tory of <HI>Alexander the Great,</HI> acquaints us, that this prince having received a quantity of &s;tuffs, and rich garments, after the fa&s;hions of his country, &s;ent them to <HI>Sy&s;igambis,</HI> with the &s;laves who had worked them; de&s;iring &s;he might be ac|quainted, that, if &s;he approved of the pre&s;ents, her daughters might be taught how they were to be worked, in order to fill up their time, and make pre&s;ents of them when fini&s;hed. At the&s;e words, the tears which fell from her cheeks, &s;hewed the little value &s;he &s;et on them; and how injurious &s;he thought the compli|ment that was paid her; there being nothing which the women in Per&s;ia, think a greater di&s;grace, than to employ them&s;elves in works of this kind. <HI>Alexander</HI> finding &s;he was mortified, went to &s;ee her, and told her, that the robe which he wore, was not only pre|&s;ented to him by his &s;i&s;ter, but even worked by her; from thence, &s;ays he, you may judge, that the cu&s;tom of my country has mi&s;led me.</P>
<P>The cu&s;tom is &s;till kept up in all the Greek families of any rank, of con&s;idering the per&s;on, who nur&s;ed
<PB N="261" REF="265">
either the ma&s;ter or mi&s;tre&s;s, as part of the family. Among the ancient Greeks, a woman, who had brought up the daughter of any per&s;on of rank, always con|tinued with her, even after marriage; and was con|&s;idered as her governe&s;s, her confidant, and coun&s;ellor. It is for this rea&s;on, that, in the ancient Greek tra|gedies, a prince&s;s &s;carce ever appears upon the &s;cene, without being accompanied by her nur&s;e. This cu&s;|tom is &s;o well kept up, that the modern name of nur&s;e, <HI>paranama,</HI> is even more expre&s;&s;ive than the ancient, and &s;ignifies <HI>&s;econd mother.</HI> She is always kept in the hou&s;e, after having nur&s;ed one of the children; and is, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, from that time, incorporated as one of the family.</P>
<P>The Greek ladies &s;till refu&s;e to &s;uckle their children, in order to pre&s;erve their beauty, their brea&s;ts, and even their health, which they con&s;ider as likely to be affected by it. They have ever been told, that their ideas, in this re&s;pect, were erroneous; and, that they made them&s;elves no better than &s;tep-mothers, by thus abandoning their children, to the care and nouri&s;h|ment of &s;trangers. The force of example and cu&s;tom, has prevailed over all the&s;e rea&s;ons. There is nothing that has been written in the pre&s;ent age, on this in|tere&s;ting &s;ubject, more forcible, than the di&s;cour&s;e of a Greek philo&s;opher; pre&s;erved to us, by <HI>Aulus Gellius,</HI> and which is well worth being related. This
<PB N="262" REF="266">
philo&s;opher went to pay a vi&s;it, to the wife of one of his people; a per&s;on of high rank, who had ju&s;t been brought to bed. When the fir&s;t compliments were over, he enquired of the mother of the lady, if her daughter propo&s;ed to &s;uckle her infant. God for|bid, replied the mother! would you have my daugh|ter, after the pain &s;he has undergone, take upon her, &s;o irk&s;ome and di&s;agreeable an office? Ah! madam! replied the philo&s;opher, let her not be a half-mother; and, after having borne for nine months in her womb, and nouri&s;hed with her blood an unformed being, whom &s;he never &s;aw nor knew, refu&s;e the milk which nature has given her, to a human being, who is come forth into the world, whom &s;he &s;ees, who exi&s;ts before her eyes, and implores her a&s;&s;i&s;tance by the mo&s;t af|fecting cries.</P>
<P>After the nur&s;e, come the &s;laves and the &s;ervants. The female &s;laves are &s;till treated, as they were in an|cient times, with great humanity and gentlene&s;s; and, after a certain time, have their freedom given to them. They a&s;&s;i&s;t their mi&s;tre&s;s, as they u&s;ed to do formerly, in their embroidery, and do all the bu&s;ine&s;s of the hou&s;e. <HI>Ariadne,</HI> when &s;he was abandoned by <HI>The&s;eus,</HI> exclaimed, from grief: <HI>how gladly &s;he would be reduced to the condition of her &s;ervants.</HI> She con&s;ented, like a &s;lave, to make the beds; to prepare the frames for the needle-work; to carry, even on her &s;houlders, a very
<FIGURE>
<PB REF="267">

<PB N="263" REF="268">
heavy pitcher; and, to give her dear <HI>The&s;eus</HI> water, to wa&s;h him&s;elf, before he &s;at down to table.</P>
<P>The &s;ervants do not remain at home, when their mi&s;tre&s;s goes out; they are obliged to follow her; and this cu&s;tom is &s;till in practice among the Greeks. <HI>Za|leucus,</HI> di&s;ciple of <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> and legi&s;lator of Locres, in Italy, his native country, to repre&s;s the luxury and vanity of the nobles, enacted a law, that no woman of quality &s;hould be attended by more than one &s;ervant, except &s;he was drunk.</P>
<P>The numerous attendants, which accompany a Gre|cian lady, is, in Greece, what a fine equipage is in England; with this difference, that no woman of any character, can go out alone; &s;he mu&s;t, at lea&s;t, have one &s;ervant with her. Tho&s;e of high rank, who&s;e vanity induces them to make an o&s;tentatious di&s;play of their grandeur, have many &s;laves to follow them.</P>
<P>I have already &s;aid, that the daughters were &s;carce ever permitted to go out, not even to church, till they were married. This la&s;t cu&s;tom, is not &s;o &s;cru|pulou&s;ly adhered to in the pre&s;ent age; they dare not, however, appear even now in the company of men, except in the pre&s;ence of their parents. <HI>Nau&s;icac</HI> &s;ays to <HI>Uly&s;&s;es, 'which of us, without the permi&s;&s;ion of her parents, would appear in public with a man, before &s;he
<PB N="264" REF="269">
was married?'</HI> Such were the wi&s;dom and &s;implicity of manners in ancient times. How very different are tho&s;e of the pre&s;ent age!</P>
<P>The wi&s;e <HI>Phocydides</HI> &s;aid, "keep your daughters clo&s;ely &s;hut up, and do not permit them to appear, even at the thre&s;hold of your doors, till they are married."</P>
<P>The young Greeks amu&s;e them&s;elves with different games; they pa&s;s their time in embroidering, or, in looking at pa&s;&s;engers through the blinds of their win|dows; which are &s;o contrived, as to enable them to &s;ee without being perceived.</P>
<P>They have al&s;o in Greece, another ancient cu&s;tom, which is to pre&s;ent their hands to their daughters, their &s;laves, and others, who are their inferiors, to ki&s;s. <HI>Euripides</HI> makes <HI>Alce&s;tes,</HI> in the tragedy, call all her women about her, by name, one after the other, and hold out her hand to them that they may ki&s;s it.</P>
<P>After the ki&s;&s;ing of hands, the greate&s;t mark of re&s;pect in the Ea&s;t, when, acco&s;ting a per&s;on of &s;u|perior rank, is, to ki&s;s or touch the hem of his gar|ment, and then to approach the hand to their lips. This is the manner in which the Turks &s;alute their
<PB N="265" REF="270">
patrons; and, for a Turk to permit an inferior to ki&s;s the &s;kirt of his garment, is con&s;idered, as taking him under their protection. On this &s;ubject, I was wit|ne&s;s, &s;ays <HI>Guy,</HI> to an act of great genero&s;ity and hu|manity, on the part of a Turk.</P>
<P>The late Marquis <HI>de Villeneuve,</HI> after having con|cluded a treaty of peace, between the emperor and the grand &s;ignior, went to the audience of the &s;ultan at the ar&s;enal. Two French &s;laves, perceiving the amba&s;&s;ador, made their e&s;cape, and went and threw them&s;elves at the feet of the amba&s;&s;ador, begging him to redeem them. Their ma&s;ter came up, and <HI>M. de Villeneuve,</HI> having a&s;ked him, how much he required for their ran&s;om; <HI>they are free,</HI> replied the Turk, <HI>and were no longer mine, from the in&s;tant they had the good fortune to ki&s;s the robe of the French amba&s;&s;ador. M. de Villeneuve,</HI> &s;truck with the &s;ubimlity of this &s;en|timent, which charmed all the &s;pectators, pulled out a very fine watch, which he had in his pocket, and pre&s;ented it to the generous Mu&s;&s;ulman.</P>
<P>The young girls, in Greece, have among them, a game, which con&s;i&s;ts in ki&s;&s;ing each other on the eyes, whil&s;t they take hold of the ears. This tender and af|fectionate mode of ki&s;&s;ing, is very ancient. <HI>Tibulius,</HI> in his elegies, notices it. <HI>Natu&s;que parenti o&s;cula com|pre&s;&s;is auribus eripiet:</HI> lib. 2. eleg. 5. 'And the child

<P>I do not like <HI>Alcippus,</HI> &s;ays a &s;hepherd in <HI>Theo|critus;</HI> becau&s;e, when I gave him a very hand&s;ome pigeon, he did not take hold of me by the ears and ki&s;s me.</P>

<P><HI>LUCIAN</HI> repre&s;ents the Greek ladies at their toilets, &s;urrounded with many attendants; &s;ome of them held the gla&s;s; others, a ewer full of water. Then came the drugs, which &s;erve to darken the eye-brows, to paint the cheeks and the lips; then the chains, necklaces, bracelets, ear-rings. In &s;hort, they were covered with gold and jewels, from head to feet. In the pre&s;ent age, there would be rather &s;ome|thing to add, than to dimini&s;h from this de&s;cription:
<PB N="267" REF="272">
all the&s;e ornaments &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t, and particularly the gold chains, which make a very nece&s;&s;ary appendage to the dre&s;s of the Greek ladies. In going back to the times of <HI>Homer,</HI> we find the &s;ame embelli&s;hments for the toilette. The deity, who afterwards fabricated the buckler for <HI>Achilles,</HI> had not before di&s;dained amu&s;ing him&s;elf, in making ornaments of this &s;ort.</P>
<P>When my mother, &s;ays <HI>Vulcan,</HI> a&s;hamed of having brought me into the world &s;o deformed, had thrown me into the &s;ea, that I might have been for ever con|cealed in its aby&s;s, I &s;hould have &s;uffered a great deal, if the beautiful <HI>Thetis,</HI> and <HI>Eurynome,</HI> the daughters of <HI>Ocean,</HI> had not picked me up. I remained nine years in a deep cave; occupied in making for them, brace|lets, agraffs, necklaces, buckles, rings, and aigrettes for the hair. <HI>Hom.</HI> Iliad. b. 17.</P>
<P>The ladies formerly, as at pre&s;ent, wore their hair tied, and much longer than the men.</P>
<P><HI>Leucippus,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Pau&s;anias,</HI> let his hair grow, to make a &s;acrifice of it to the river Alpheus. After having tied it in the &s;ame manner as the girls, he put on fe|male attire, and went to &s;ee <HI>Daphne,</HI> who was deceived by the di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="273">The head-dre&s;s of the Greek ladies, e&s;pecially when it is low, is generally &s;et off by a heron's feather; and they then place in front, another &s;mall black feather, or a coloured one; frizzing the hair round with a low curl.</P>
<P>May not the&s;e feathers bear &s;ome relation to the ancient cu&s;tom, &s;poken of by <HI>Winkleman,</HI> in his beau|tiful collection of antique monuments? The Mu&s;es, had a di&s;pute about &s;inging, in the i&s;land of Crete, with the Syrens, who challenged them to a trial of &s;kill, and were conquered. The Mu&s;es, as a puni&s;h|ment for their temerity, cut their wings, and affixed to their head-dre&s;s, one of their feathers as a trophy. The Greek women, therefore, may have received this ornament from the Mu&s;es. They are fond, at lea&s;t, of repre&s;enting them; when they di&s;pute with each other, as they do at pre&s;ent, who &s;hall carry off the prize in &s;inging; or, when they &s;ing couplets alternatively; a &s;ort of entertaining combat; the object of which is, who &s;hall recite la&s;t, and gain the victory over the others.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, they have different &s;orts of head-dre&s;&s;es, more or le&s;s ornamented, which they vary many ways. Sometimes their hair falls in tre&s;&s;es down their &s;houl|ders; it is often curled up all round the head, or neg|ligently tied up with flowers.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="274">The mitre, which the women wore formerly, had little fillets; which, coming down by the cheeks, tied under the chin.</P>
<P>The Greeks have the &s;ame kind of ornament at pre&s;ent, embroidered in gold, with fringes. They call it the <HI>Mahoulika;</HI> and it generally announces &s;ome in|di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>The Greek ladies, have ever been fond of covering them&s;elves with jewels. The buckles of their girdles, their necklaces, their bracelets, are enriched with them; and, although they are fond of adorning their hair with the fine&s;t flowers of the &s;pring, diamonds are intermingled with the je&s;&s;amin and ro&s;es. They often dre&s;s them&s;elves up, when they have no inten|tion of going out, or of being &s;een, merely to con|template them&s;elves. The&s;e ornaments are never laid by, but for &s;ome deep and indi&s;pen&s;able mourning; or, for &s;ome poignant cau&s;e of grief.</P>
<P>Thus, the celebrated <HI>Sapho,</HI> writes to <HI>Phaon:</HI> 'I have not dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf out &s;ince your ab&s;ence, nor even taken the pains to comb out my hair. I wear no rings on my fingers, no gold in my hair; I do not perfume my&s;elf with the e&s;&s;ence of Arabia; my dre&s;s is neglected, and without ornament; for, whom &s;hould I wi&s;h to plea&s;e?'</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="275">What <HI>Sapho</HI> did for her lover, the Greek women, with much more propriety, do for their hu&s;bands; and, in their ab&s;ence, mo&s;t of them take no pains in orna|menting their per&s;ons.</P>
<P>In &s;peaking of the ornaments and jewels, of the Greek ladies; we will bring to our reader's recollec|tion, an anecdote pre&s;erved to us by <HI>Plutarch.</HI> An Ionian lady, a friend of <HI>Phocion</HI>'s &s;econd wife, and who was on a vi&s;it to her, took great pains in di&s;playing her jewels to her; which con&s;i&s;ted in bracelets and necklaces, ornamented with gold and precious &s;tones. She replied to her, <HI>my only ornament is Phocion;</HI> who, for the&s;e twenty years, has been general of the Athe|nians.</P>
<P>Among the modern Greek ladies, might be found &s;imilar <HI>traits</HI> of &s;entiment, if there were but any <HI>Phocions.</HI></P>
<P>To form &s;ome idea of the exce&s;s, to which luxury has carried the Greek women, we mu&s;t hear what St. <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tom</HI> &s;ays on the &s;ubject, re&s;pecting the women of his time. "Be&s;ides, &s;ays he, their ear-rings, they have other jewels, to ornament the extremity of their cheeks. Their eye-la&s;hes, and their whole face, are covered with paint. Their petticoats are netted with gold threads; their necklaces are gold; they likewi&s;e
<PB N="271" REF="276">
wear thin plates of gold on the wri&s;ts. Their &s;hoes are black, very &s;hining, and terminated in a point: (the form of the &s;hoe is &s;till the &s;ame, but the colour is changed). They ride on cars, drawn by white mules, with a numerous train of &s;laves and attendants."</P>
<P>The Greek women, of the pre&s;ent day, when they would go to any di&s;tance, not chu&s;ing to make a di&s;|play of their diamonds in the &s;treets, have them carried with them, to put on before they enter the hou&s;e, where they are going, and take them off before they return, when their vi&s;it is over. This is a very an|cient cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>Another proof of adherence to ancient cu&s;toms, in the Greek ladies, is the fan, and the manner of which they make u&s;e of it. This fan is very large, circular, compo&s;ed of peacocks feathers, and has an ivory &s;tick; in the centre, is a &s;mall gla&s;s. The ladies carry it into the country; and when fatigued with the heat, they repo&s;e them&s;elves on a &s;ofa; a &s;lave takes the fan from his mi&s;tre&s;s, and ventilates the air with it to re|fre&s;h her.</P>
<P><HI>Athenaeus</HI> de&s;cribes this fan, and &s;cites &s;ome ver&s;es from <HI>Anacreon,</HI> where this poet giving the portrait of one <HI>Artemon,</HI> a voluptuous and effeminate man, &s;ays,
<PB N="272" REF="277">
he carries with him a round fan, with an ivory &s;tick, which &s;erves him for a para&s;ol like the women.</P>
<P>In Achaia, on a marble tomb, of which <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> gives a de&s;cription, is &s;een, &s;ays this writer, a young per&s;on of great beauty, &s;eated in an ivory chair; and near her, one of her attendants, who holds a large fan, or para&s;ol over her head.</P>
<P>The u&s;e of the veil, is of very ancient date; &s;ince, it has been di&s;covered in times of remote antiquity. The veil, that &s;ymbol of mode&s;ty, which not only conceals from the prying eye, certain defects; but tends, likewi&s;e, to make beauty more attracting; which &s;eems to announce mode&s;ty, and cover the in|nocent blu&s;h of timid youth; this <HI>degag&eacute;e</HI> ornament, has ever been a favourite with beauty and the graces. No reproach can be ca&s;t on the Greek ladies, for not having faithfully pre&s;erved it. It makes, as formerly, an e&s;&s;ential part in their dre&s;s, and di&s;tingui&s;hes the different ranks. That of the mi&s;tre&s;s, and the &s;ervant; of the free woman, and the &s;lave, are very different. There is an art in adju&s;ting it, to veil them&s;elves de|cently and agreeably.</P>
<P>A young beauty, who veils her face, &s;ays a Greek poet, is but the more ardently &s;ought after; and ex|cites in her lovers, great eagerne&s;s in concealing her|&s;elf
<PB N="273" REF="278">
from their looks. This u&s;eful le&s;&s;on, is as ancient as the world, co-eval with beauty and the veil. The Romans, who were no le&s;s &s;evere in their injunctions, impo&s;ed on the women not to appear in public, with|out being veiled.</P>
<P>This veil, covered, as at pre&s;ent, the head and a part of the body; it was, con&s;equently, very long: and, it was, no doubt, from its length, that it obtained the appellation of <HI>Macrama.</HI></P>
<P>Yet the Greek veil does not cover the face in the &s;ame manner, as that of the Turki&s;h women; for this rea&s;on, the modern Greeks make u&s;e of this latter, to conceal them&s;elves with more care; e&s;pecially when they go to any di&s;tance, or in parts inhabited by the Turks.</P>
<P>In the Ea&s;t, the veil &s;eems to have been as ancient as the world. <HI>Abimelec,</HI> king of Gerar, re&s;toring <HI>Abra|ham</HI> his wife, tells him, that he &s;hall add &s;ome flocks and &s;laves, of both &s;exes, to attend her. "For you, Sarah, continues the king, there are a thou&s;and pieces of &s;ilver, which I commit to the care of this man, whom you call brother. It is proper to furni&s;h him with a &s;um &s;ufficient to purcha&s;e a veil, &s;uitable to the condition of one &s;o re&s;pectable as your&s;elf; that your &s;ervants may always remember, that you are the
<PB N="274" REF="279">
&s;pou&s;e of your ma&s;ter; and to let all &s;trangers know, that you are a married woman. Never forget, that by neglecting that mark of di&s;tinction, common to per|&s;ons of your rank, in this country, you have expo&s;ed your&s;elf too much."</P>
<P>The value which king Gerar put upon this veil, calls to mind what <HI>Plato</HI> &s;ays, that there were in Per&s;ia, large provinces; one of which, was called the girdle; and the other, the queen's veil; becau&s;e, in fact, their revenues were appropriated to the expence of the veils and girdles of the queen.</P>
<P>The origin of the veil is referred, by the Greeks, to mode&s;ty and ba&s;hfulne&s;s; properties which partake equally of timidity. A very plea&s;ant &s;tory is told on this &s;ubject, recorded to us by <HI>Pau&s;anias.</HI> "About thirty furlongs from the city of Sparta, <HI>Icarius</HI> placed a &s;tatue of mode&s;ty, to perpetuate the following in|cident."</P>
<P><HI>Icarius,</HI> having married his daughter to <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> en|treated him to fix his re&s;idence at Sparta, to which <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> would not con&s;ent. Di&s;appointed in his wi&s;hes, he made a &s;imilar application to his daughter, and en|treated her not to abandon him; and &s;eeing her ready to depart with <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> for Ithaca, he redoubled his ef|forts to detain her; nor could he be prevented from
<PB N="275" REF="280">
following them. <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> wearied with his importu|nities, told his wife, that &s;he was at free liberty, either to return with her father to Sparta, or to go along with him to Ithaca. On hearing this, the beautiful <HI>Penelope,</HI> it is &s;aid, blu&s;hed; and, without making any reply, threw a veil over her face. <HI>Icarius</HI> under&s;tood her meaning, and let her go with her hu&s;band. But, moved at his daughter's embarra&s;&s;ment, he con&s;ecrated a &s;tatue to mode&s;ty, on the &s;pot where <HI>Penelope</HI> had thrown a veil over her face; that henceforward it might be a univer&s;al &s;ymbol of delicacy with the fair &s;ex.</P>
<P>The veil worn by the Greek ladies, is generally of mu&s;lin, bordered with gold. That of the common people, of a coar&s;er &s;ort of plain mu&s;lin. It is always white; &s;uch as the monuments of old, repre&s;ent the veils of <HI>Hermione</HI> and <HI>Helen.</HI></P>
<P>The modern Greeks (the men) wear a &s;ort of &s;carf about the neck; which, occa&s;ionally, goes over the head, and &s;erves to &s;creen it from the wind and rain. The women al&s;o wear one of a &s;imilar kind, but of a finer &s;tuff than that of the men. They u&s;e them again&s;t the inclemency of the weather.</P>
<P>The girdle, in ancient times, as well as the pre&s;ent, was con&s;idered, by the ea&s;tern people, as an e&s;&s;ential
<PB N="276" REF="281">
part of dre&s;s. <HI>David</HI> &s;peaking of the puni&s;hment due to an impious man, and a calumniator of his neighbour, adds:</P>
<P>"He cloathed him&s;elf with cur&s;ing, as with a rai|ment. Let it be as the cloke that he hath upon him, and as the girdle, he is always girded withal."</P>
<P>The Greeks wear a girdle, like the inhabitants of the Ea&s;t. That of the women, which is richer, and more luxuriantly ornamented, is con&s;idered as a very important part of dre&s;s. The girdle was, with the an|cients, a token of the bride's virginity; and, after the celebration of the matrimonial rites, hung up in the temple of <HI>Diana,</HI> from whence it was taken down, and carried away by the bridegroom, as &s;oon as he became legally entitled to it; that is, when the perfect con|&s;ummation of the marriage was effected.</P>
<P>The embroidered girdle of the Greek ladies, is fre|quently fa&s;tened by a buckle, with diamonds, or eme|ralds, re&s;embling that of <HI>Venus,</HI> which <HI>Homer</HI> de&s;cribes &s;o brilliant, and which was al&s;o quilted and em|broidered.</P>
<P>Nothing is more ancient among the Greeks, than con&s;ecrating the girdle at their marriage.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="282">The Greeks, and Turks likewi&s;e, to this day, wear a girdle, in order to fa&s;ten their pur&s;e; into which, they put the money they receive, or chu&s;e to carry about them. This cu&s;tom is &s;o ancient, that &s;peaking of a man who has lo&s;t his all, they &s;ay, he has lo&s;t his girdle.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXXIX.</HI> Diver&s;ions, Entertainments, and Fe&s;tivals.</HEAD>
<P>THE Greeks have ever been a people devoted to fe&s;tivals. The greate&s;t &s;olemnities of religion are but &s;o many occa&s;ions of public rejoicing; and they celebrate them accordingly, with all the &s;plendor of temporal fe&s;tivity. On the&s;e occa&s;ions, their piety is not &s;o con&s;picuous, as their attachment to &s;ublunary joys. In the time of St. <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tom,</HI> the ancient Greeks had, for occa&s;ions of magnificence, tables &s;urrounded with a border of ma&s;&s;y &s;ilver, and in the &s;hape of a C. Such, at pre&s;ent, is the form of their tables in Greece; but they are no longer ornamented with &s;ilver; and cu&s;hions placed round for &s;eats. Conver&s;ation has no
<PB N="278" REF="283">
longer any charms for them. Their &s;ole delight is to eat, and that to exce&s;s. The ancient Greek term for a repa&s;t, &s;ignified an a&s;&s;embly of per|&s;ons eating and drinking together; an idea very different from what the Romans conceived of tho&s;e entertainments; &s;uch a meeting by them was called <HI>convivium;</HI> or, a circle of per&s;ons uniting at table to entertain each other agreeably. <HI>Cicero</HI> has not neg|lected to make this di&s;tinction, in &s;peaking of convi|vial meetings. "The &s;upreme enjoyment of life, &s;ays the Roman orator, is, according to my idea, to pa&s;s our convivial hours with worthy men, of a facetious di&s;po&s;ition, by whom we are e&s;teemed. I would not be under&s;tood, he adds, to mean the &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure of the table; but that harmony of mind, and freedom of &s;entiment, which ari&s;es from an a&s;&s;embly of familiar friends. The&s;e only can form the plea&s;ures of a re|pa&s;t. Accordingly, we Romans, in giving to our fea&s;ts a name, which &s;ignifies the act of living together, have certainly de&s;cribed it much better than the Greeks; who, in their denomination, though of one word, expre&s;s &s;imply the act of eating and drinking, without any allu&s;ion whatever to &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The Greeks &s;till drink to exce&s;s in their entertain|ments; their fe&s;tivals &s;eldom fini&s;hing, until the gue&s;ts are unable to proceed. The Romans, when they u&s;ed
<PB N="279" REF="284">
any exce&s;s of this kind, called it <HI>pergraecari, i. e.</HI> to drink after the manner of the Greeks.</P>
<P>In ancient Greece, the lovers of wine, like tho&s;e of the pre&s;ent age, challenged each other to trials of drinking. When <HI>Alexander</HI> conducted his army into Per&s;ia, his officers abandoned them&s;elves to the great|e&s;t exce&s;s, in company with the natives, who were re|nowned for their abilities, in &s;upporting the mo&s;t un|bounded libations to the god of wine.</P>
<P>They always drink their wine unmixed, &s;ays <HI>Spon;</HI> and when in company, the toa&s;t and the gla&s;s circulate together.</P>
<P>The cu&s;tom of &s;inging at table, is very ancient with the Greeks. Each in his turn, drinks to the health of his mi&s;tre&s;s, and generally repeats it, in conformity to the number of letters contained in her name. <HI>Theo|critus,</HI> in the fourteenth book of his Idyll, gives the de&s;cription of a rural fea&s;t, which is the exact repre|&s;entation of a modern repa&s;t.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e entertainments given in the country, are called relaxations of the mind; to which are joined, the amu&s;ements of playing and dancing: a table being provided, accorded to the number of the gue&s;ts, in &s;hape like the Greek letter &Pgr;. The mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed
<PB N="280" REF="285">
per&s;ons, place them&s;elves at the bottom, and are im|mediately joined by the ma&s;ter of the fea&s;t, who in|&s;tantly fills a bumper to the health of his friends, who pledge him re&s;pectively in their turns. Lambs &s;tuffed and baked, with the &s;kins drawn on, are &s;erved up, and are the principal di&s;hes. Pitchers of wine go round in pretty quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The gue&s;ts grow warm, and pre&s;ently the buffoon comedians enter. Songs &s;et to &s;low, grave tunes, u&s;her in their &s;ports; the mu&s;ic pre&s;ently becomes more &s;prightly, and free|dom of &s;entiment goes round. Some &s;eize the lyre, while others ri&s;e to dance. They generally begin fir&s;t a dance performed by one or two per&s;ons. This dance being bri&s;k, and performed with a bounding &s;tep, re|&s;embles the rigadoon very much; which, indeed, ap|pears to be of Greek origin. They then proceed in irregular figures, which cannot well be de&s;cribed, until the whole ends in a general confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Honey is in very great e&s;timation with the Greeks. That gathered on mount Hymettus, was anciently con|&s;ecrated to the u&s;e of religious fe&s;tivals. It is now much coveted by them, even in the &s;tate in which it is taken from the hive.</P>
<P>Olives, which Greece, and the country about Athens, in particular, furni&s;h in great abundance, are much in reque&s;t with this people. They give the
<PB N="281" REF="286">
&s;ame name to pickled olives, as the ancients. Cakes of meal, al&s;o form a part of the Greek fea&s;t, and are in great reque&s;t with them. <HI>Homer</HI> mentions, that in his time, they were always prepared by the women. It is the &s;ame now. On the eve of Ea&s;ter, and other great fe&s;tivals, the&s;e cakes are always &s;ent by the Greeks, as pre&s;ents to each other.</P>
<P>The ancient cu&s;tom of eating their corn parched, or roa&s;ted, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have preceded the pre&s;ent method of brui&s;ing, or grinding it, &s;till &s;ub|&s;i&s;ts. In Greece, Turki&s;h corn in the grain, and chick|pea&s;e, boiled, are a very general food.</P>
<P>It is among the common people we mu&s;t always look for ancient manners. They refine but little, and are ever tenacious of the traditions handed down to them by their ance&s;tors; and &s;o much attached to them, that they bear with them the force of &s;o many laws. In the reports of the modern Greeks, we find not only the ancient exce&s;s, and &s;implicity of beha|viour; but al&s;o tho&s;e fe&s;tal crowns, which paint in &s;uch lively colours, the heart-felt joy of the jocund re|vellers. Lovers al&s;o, ornament their heads with crowns of flowers, and make garlands of them; which they afterwards hang in wreaths, and various fe&s;toons, over the doors of their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es. When a Greek crowns him&s;elf with flowers, it denotes that he carries the
<PB N="282" REF="287">
livery of love; or, that he is engaged in &s;ome fe&s;tive debauch. Such was the crown worn by that young rake <HI>Polemon,</HI> at Athens; of whom, a plea&s;ant adven|ture is related by <HI>Diogenes Laertius.</HI> 'Sallying forth one day, after a debauch, and hot with the juice of the grape; he &s;tumbled, unexpectedly, into the &s;chool of <HI>Xenocrates.</HI> His dre&s;s, though ill-&s;uited to the ta&s;te of a philo&s;ophic academy, for he was crowned with flowers, perfumed with e&s;&s;ences, and tricked out with all the arts of foppery, was no impediment to his mix|ing in an a&s;&s;embly of &s;o contrary a character. Taking a &s;eat in the mid&s;t of the philo&s;ophers, he began to in|terrupt the order of their &s;chool, by ill-timed que&s;|tions, and ridiculous ob&s;ervations. <HI>Xenocrates,</HI> with|out any alteration of features or manner, changed the &s;ubject he was then upon, and turned all his rhetoric, into an attack upon the folly of intemperance. His oratory had &s;uch an effect on the young libertine, that his rea&s;on immediately returned to him. He tore the crown from his head, and threw it on the ground, at the feet of <HI>Xenocrates:</HI> &s;tung with a &s;en&s;e of &s;hame and remor&s;e, for his pa&s;t conduct, he was unable to bear the &s;ight of tho&s;e about him; but wrapping him&s;elf in his cloke, he at once concealed his fully and him&s;elf. Converted by this means, to the love of philo&s;ophy, he &s;oon became one of his mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous di&s;ciples.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="288"><HI>Athenaeus</HI> informs us, that the gallants of his time, decorated the doors of the fair they admired, with flowers; in the &s;ame manner, that the doors of their temples were adorned. It is no doubt, from thence, that the modern Greeks derive the cu&s;tom of crowning the doors of their own, and their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es hou&s;es, an|nually, on the fir&s;t of May. On this day, the young men pre&s;ent them&s;elves before the doors of their fa|vourite ladies, walking to and fro, endeavouring to draw them, at lea&s;t, to the windows, by &s;ongs and in|&s;truments. In ancient times, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, the young men even addre&s;&s;ed the hou&s;es, where the fair re&s;ided, in the mo&s;t plaintive and moving terms. Some|times in ca&s;es of obdurate treatment, when urged to de&s;peration, they have not refrained from bur&s;ting open the doors. But other lovers, more patient under their &s;ufferings, quietly contented them&s;elves with lay|ing down at the thre&s;hold of the door, which continued &s;hut on purpo&s;e for their preclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Nothing, &s;ays <HI>Guy,</HI> has offered me greater plea&s;ure, and entertainment, than the Greek dances. Every country has &s;ome peculiar dances to it&s;elf, and Greece is not deficient in that particular; on the contrary, it has a great variety. The Greeks have &s;ome dances expre&s;&s;ive of their national character, which mu&s;t be of very ancient extraction; and, as it were, hereditary to them. They are ea&s;y to learn; imitation &s;upplies
<PB N="284" REF="289">
the want of ma&s;ters. Dances compo&s;ed of many &s;teps, and intricate figures, requiring great attention and preci&s;ion, are ea&s;ily forgot; but the common dan|cers of every country, being more &s;imple, gay, and ea&s;y, are never lo&s;t; becau&s;e, frequently repeated. The&s;e la&s;t are practi&s;ed at every fe&s;tival. The young men and women are ambitious to excel in them; and the old people delight to be &s;pectators of their per|formances; even children in their infancy, who can &s;carce walk with firmne&s;s, kick about their little heels in imitation of the dancers.</P>
<P>A company of Greeks, in the country villages, old and young, hand in hand, dancing and &s;inging ver&s;es, writ for the purpo&s;e, in a &s;tyle of altercation, brings to remembrance the Lacedemonian choirs, when the old men attack the youth in the&s;e words:
<Q><L>We once were young and gay as you,</L>
<L>Valiant, and bold, and active too.</L></Q></P>
<P>To which the youth an&s;wer:
<Q><L>'Tis now our turn, and you &s;hall &s;ee,</L>
<L>You ne'er de&s;erv'd it more than we.</L></Q></P>
<P>The children too, bear their part in the ceremony, crying out with their little &s;hrill voices,
<Q><PB N="285" REF="290">
<L>The day will come when we &s;hall &s;hew</L>
<L>Feats, that &s;urpa&s;s all you can do.</L></Q></P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ion of the Greeks for dancing, is common to both &s;exes; who neglect every other con&s;ideration, when they have an opportunity of indulging that pa&s;|&s;ion. We find a pa&s;&s;age in <HI>Herodotus,</HI> which might &s;erve as a le&s;&s;on again&s;t the extravagant length they &s;ometimes carry it.</P>
<P><HI>Cly&s;thenes,</HI> prince of Syconia, having declared, he would marry his daughter to that per&s;on who &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s the greate&s;t valour, invited to his court, all tho&s;e who might a&s;pire to an alliance with the prin|ce&s;s. He propo&s;ed his gue&s;ts &s;hould pa&s;s &s;ome time with him, that he might be the better able to ex|amine into their characters. The two Athenians who were candidates, became his favourites, and princi|pally <HI>Hypoclides,</HI> &s;on of <HI>Ty&s;ander,</HI> one greatly re|nowned for his courage.</P>
<P>The day being come on which he was to make his choice, he gave a &s;uperb entertainment to the &s;uitors for his daughter. After the repa&s;t, they began to &s;ing; a free circulation of the bottle en&s;ued, and the gue&s;ts became exhilarated. <HI>Hypoclides</HI> de&s;ired the per|formers to play a &s;erious dance; in the execution of which, he &s;eemed to take more delight him&s;elf, than
<PB N="286" REF="291">
he afforded the &s;pectators. <HI>Cly&s;thenes</HI> attended to the whole, but &s;eemed to take no notice. <HI>Hypoclides,</HI> after re&s;ting awhile, ordered a &s;econd table to be brought, in which he exhibited a dance after the Spar|tan manner, and afterwards fell into the Athenian figures. At length, being elevated to a mo&s;t extraor|dinary pitch, he pre&s;ented the company with a dance, which con&s;i&s;ted of holding up the hands and clapping them. <HI>Cly&s;thenes,</HI> who had by this time conceived the greate&s;t aver&s;ion for the dancer, could no longer con|tain his indignation at &s;uch ridiculous behaviour, but calls out to him to de&s;i&s;t, with the&s;e remarkable words: <HI>&s;on of Ty&s;ander, thou has danced away a wife.</HI> A young Greek of the pre&s;ent age, heated by dancing and wine, would be likely to commit the &s;ame exce&s;s as <HI>Hypoclides, and dance away his marriage.</HI></P>
<P>This exerci&s;e, is, doubtle&s;s, of all countries, and of all ages; but the Greeks have carried it to greater ex|ce&s;s than other nations. Among them, the dance was formerly one of the gymna&s;tic &s;ports. It entered into the &s;cience of phy&s;ic, and was pre&s;cribed by the fa|culty on many occa&s;ions. Even the military &s;chools admitted it into their practice. All conditions of peo|ple were fond of it. In the end, it was introduced as part of the ceremony at fe&s;tivals. It gave life and &s;pirit to tho&s;e meetings. The poets them&s;elves, re|cited and &s;ung their ver&s;es, dancing at the &s;ame time:
<PB N="287" REF="292">
<HI>Plato, Ari&s;totle, Xenophon, Plutarch, Lucian, Athenaeus,</HI> and all the mo&s;t famous Greek authors of antiquity, have written in favour of dancing. <HI>Anacreon,</HI> the prince of jollity and plea&s;ure, was always fond of dancing; he even practi&s;ed it in his old age. <HI>A&s;pa&s;ia,</HI> who&s;e very appearance was capable of exciting the mo&s;t agreeable &s;en&s;ations in the minds of all beholders, charmed <HI>Socrates</HI> &s;o much with her dancing, that he could not refrain from imitating her. "You laugh, &s;ays <HI>Socrates</HI> to his friends, becau&s;e you &s;ee me danc|ing like young people. You think it ridiculous then, to practi&s;e &s;o &s;alutary an exerci&s;e, and which tends to render the body light? Am I then to blame, for en|deavouring to dimini&s;h, by dancing, the corpulent &s;tate of my body? You do not know, perhaps, that <HI>Charmides,</HI> who is here, &s;urpri&s;ed me the other day, when I was dancing in my own hou&s;e? It is true, &s;aid <HI>Charmides,</HI> and I was &s;o a&s;toni&s;hed, that I thought at fir&s;t you were out of your mind; but, when I had heard what you now repeat upon dancing, I was im|patient, when I returned home, to endeavour to imi|tate you." <HI>Ari&s;tides,</HI> notwith&s;tanding what <HI>Plato</HI> &s;aid, danced at a fea&s;t given hy <HI>Diony&s;ius,</HI> the tyrant. <HI>Scipio Africanus,</HI> after their example, entertained &s;ome com|pany at his own hou&s;e with a dance, in which &s;trength and agility were united. <HI>Cornelius Nepos,</HI> who wrote the life of <HI>Epaminondas,</HI> de&s;cribing the great qualities
<PB N="288" REF="293">
of his hero, expatiates on his talents for mu&s;ic and dancing.</P>
<P>If men valued them&s;elves for excelling in this art, it mu&s;t be an e&s;&s;ential qualification for women. It was from &s;eeing <HI>Helen</HI> dance at the fe&s;tival of <HI>Diana,</HI> that <HI>The&s;eus</HI> and <HI>Perithous</HI> conceived the de&s;ign of running off with her.</P>
<P><HI>Diony&s;ius,</HI> the geographical poet, mentions certain dances which the Greek women of A&s;ia Minor prac|ti&s;ed on the banks of the Cai&s;tor. "You will &s;ee, &s;ays he, the women dre&s;&s;ed in their riche&s;t girdles, performing the dances made for the fe&s;tival of <HI>Bacchus,</HI> compo&s;ed of figures in a circular form, and executed with the greate&s;t regularity and neatne&s;s. The girls al&s;o join in them; the delicacy of their form, the ele|gance of their motions, and the gracefulne&s;s of their robes, gently waving with the wind, pre&s;enting a mo&s;t enchanting &s;ight to the &s;pectators.</P>
<P>The modern Greek ladies, are equally capable of giving &s;atisfaction to tho&s;e who come to gaze upon them. Formerly, the dances repre&s;ented the actions and manners of the people; for which rea&s;on, <HI>Lucian</HI> lays it down as a rule, that a dancer, to excel in his art, ought to be well in&s;tructed in the fables and hi&s;|tory of the heathen deities.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="294">At all their fe&s;tivals, they &s;ung the prai&s;es of the divi|nity they met to celebrate; and the dances which fol|lowed the &s;ongs, de&s;cribed the principal actions of the god. Among others, they danced the triumph of <HI>Bacchus,</HI> and the nuptials of <HI>Venus;</HI> the love of <HI>Diana</HI> and <HI>Endymion;</HI> the judgment of <HI>Paris,</HI> and <HI>Europa</HI>'s pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Jove.</HI> All the&s;e dances were &s;o many moving pictures, where the ge&s;tures and &s;tep, the mo|tions of the limbs, and the inflexions of the body, de|&s;cribed the mo&s;t intere&s;ting &s;ituations; in &s;hort, all the movements the human body was capable of.</P>
<P>The dancers who now exhibit in the &s;treets or fields, and run about hand in hand, repre&s;ent tho&s;e ancient dances, which compo&s;ed part of the public wor&s;hip. The modern Greeks never celebrate any fe&s;tival, or &s;olemnity, without dancing round the altar; or, at lea&s;t, about the temple, agreeable to the cu&s;tom of their ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>The Greeks had different choru&s;&s;es of &s;ongs and dances. The orbicular choir, which &s;ang the <HI>Dithy|rambi,</HI> and danced to that &s;pecies of &s;ong in prai&s;e of <HI>Bacchus,</HI> had a particular figure which it al&s;o per|formed. Sometimes the hands were extended, at other times folded together; and, at la&s;t, they danced round the altar. Since the decline of the Greek thea|tre, the&s;e choirs are reduced to a meer round-about
<PB N="290" REF="295">
figure, which the Greeks &s;till u&s;e. They continue the &s;ame method, of extending and folding the hands, dancing &s;ometimes to the &s;ound of the lyre; at others, to the chanting of hymns; but not round the altar of <HI>Bacchus,</HI> and the re&s;t of their gods, as formerly: the modern Greeks fix upon &s;ome towering oak, and crown it with flowers, and other decorations; under the &s;hadow of which, they celebrate their mo&s;t &s;o|lemn fe&s;tivals, renewing the ancient orgies, with the &s;ame licentiou&s;ne&s;s and exce&s;s.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent age very often exhibits an exact image of the ancient choirs of Greek nymphs; and when they dance, hand in hand, round the meadows, or in the woods, recall to mind tho&s;e ancient de&s;criptions given by the poets of <HI>Diana,</HI> and her choir; whether on mount Delos, or on the banks of Eurotas, as <HI>Virgil</HI> &s;ays, &s;he leads the mazy dance, accompanied by the nymphs of her train.</P>
<P>The Eleu&s;inian women, in&s;tituted certain dances, which they practi&s;ed about a well called <HI>Callichorus.</HI> The&s;e were accompanied by &s;ongs which they &s;ung in honor of the godde&s;s.</P>
<P>In the like manner, &s;ays <HI>Guys,</HI> I have &s;een in Prin|ces-i&s;land; the young women, who were a&s;&s;embled round a well in the evening, to draw water, &s;uddenly
<PB N="291" REF="296">
&s;trike up a dance, while others &s;ung in concert to them. <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> ob&s;erves of the public wells, that they &s;erve as cements to &s;ociety, uniting the citizens of each village, in the bands of friend&s;hip, by the &s;ocial intercour&s;e of &s;o frequently dancing together round them. He adds, the ancients compo&s;ed ver&s;es, which were &s;ung by the people, while they drew water, and were called <HI>&s;ongs of the well.</HI></P>
<P>The ancient Greeks had their nuptial dances, as well as the pre&s;ent age. <HI>Mu&s;aeus,</HI> mentioning the &s;ecret marriage of <HI>Hero</HI> and <HI>Leander,</HI> &s;ays, it was performed without the cu&s;tomary dances. "The nuptial bed, it is true, was prepared, but the hymenaeal &s;ongs, the epithalamium, and the torch, were omitted."</P>
<P>The principal dances, now in fa&s;hion among the Greeks, are the Candian, Greek, Arnatic, Walla|chian, Pyrrhic, and the country dances.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t two are very much alike; one appears to have been copied from the other, except that the airs are different. A young woman always leads in both, holding in her hands a handkerchief, or &s;ilken &s;tring.</P>
<P>The Candian is the mo&s;t ancient of any of them; we have an account of it in <HI>Homer,</HI> in his de&s;cription of the famous buckler of <HI>Achilles.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="297">"After enumerating many of the &s;ubjects de&s;cribed on that wonderful piece of art, <HI>Vulcan,</HI> &s;ays he, repre|&s;ents a dance of admirable variety, very &s;imilar to that which the ingenious <HI>Daedalus</HI> invented, in the city of Gno&s;&s;us, for the lovely <HI>Ariadne.</HI> The young men and women join hands and dance together. The women, being dre&s;&s;ed in robes of fine &s;tuff, have al&s;o crowns upon their heads. The men wear beautiful habits, of the mo&s;t brilliant colour. Sometimes the whole &s;et clo&s;e in a circle, and dance round with &s;o much ra|pidity and ju&s;tne&s;s, that the motion of a wheel is not more &s;wift and even. At other times they &s;eparate; and, dividing into parties, de&s;cribe an infinite number of turns and figures in their movements."</P>
<P>The Candian dance of the moderns, is nearly &s;imilar. The air is &s;oft and tender, and begins with a &s;low tune, but pre&s;ently after grows more lively and ani|mating. She who leads the dance, performs a num|ber of figures and traver&s;e lines; the variety of which, produces a very agreeable and intere&s;ting &s;pectacle.</P>
<P>From the Candian, &s;prung the Greek dance, which the i&s;landers are yet very fond of, called <HI>Ariadne</HI>'s dance; &s;ee the plate, which exhibits the temple of <HI>Minerva,</HI> now &s;tanding. In this dance, the men and women begin with the &s;ame &s;teps and figures, but &s;e|parately; and, joining afterwards, mix together with|out
<PB N="293" REF="298">
any order or regularity. The woman who leads the dance, after chu&s;ing a partner, takes him by the hand, and pre&s;ents him with one end of a ribband, or &s;ilken &s;tring, holding the other her&s;elf; the re&s;t of the dancers pa&s;s and repa&s;s under this &s;tring, (being gene|rally of a con&s;iderable length) one party as if flying, and the other &s;eeming to pur&s;ue. The movements th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n become &s;lower, and the whole party forms into a circle; the conductre&s;s, after many turns, and changes of &s;ituations, rolls, as it were, the whole &s;et about her. The dexterity of the lady, con&s;i&s;ts in quickly di&s;engag|ing her&s;elf from this embarra&s;&s;ment, and appearing again at the head of the dancers, who are very nume|rous and by this time placed in ranks. Waving her hand with an air of triumph and exhultation, &s;he re|po&s;es the ribband as at the beginning.</P>
<P>It will readily occur to our learned readers, that the idea of this dance, was taken from the labyrinth of Crete. <HI>Callimachus,</HI> in his hymn to <HI>Delos,</HI> mentions it, and &s;ays, that <HI>The&s;eus,</HI> who invented it fir&s;t, led the dance him&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Eu&s;tathius,</HI> in his &s;trictures on the eighteenth book of the Iliad, &s;ays, that anciently the men and women danced in &s;eparate parties, and that <HI>The&s;eus</HI> was the fir&s;t who mixed them together, in the dance performed by the youth. He made the young men and maidens,

<P>In the <HI>monumenti Antichi,</HI> of <HI>Winckleman,</HI> an antique va&s;e is de&s;cribed, where <HI>The&s;eus</HI> is repre&s;ented before <HI>Ariadne.</HI> The hero has in her hand, the famous clue of thread, by which he e&s;caped from the labyrinth of Crete; <HI>Ariadne,</HI> habited in the dre&s;s of a dancer, with a <HI>caftan,</HI> or Greek robe, has a &s;tring in both her hands, preci&s;ely &s;uch as the modern dancers u&s;e, when they lead the Greek dance.</P>
<P>The Arnatic, is another dance belonging to the Greeks. It is of a very ancient date, and peculiar to the military. Formerly, the Greeks had many dances of this kind: they even engaged the enemy fighting. <HI>Diodorus,</HI> the Sicilian, relates the &s;ame of the Lu&s;ita|nians.</P>
<P>The Arnatic, is led by a man and a woman.

<HEAD>THE PYRRHIC DANCE.</HEAD>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="301">The Pyrrhic is the true military dance, and has the honour of claiming its de&s;cent from <HI>Pyrrhus,</HI> king of Epirus, who &s;u&s;tained &s;uch a long war again&s;t the Ro|mans. There are many dances which bear this name. <HI>Xenophon,</HI> &s;peaking of the Thracians, who exhibited at the fe&s;tival of their prince <HI>Seuthes,</HI> &s;ays, a dance was performed by armed men, with a kind of jumping &s;tep, to the mu&s;ic of flutes; one party attacking very dex|terou&s;ly with their lances; while the other, with equal addre&s;s, parried the thru&s;ts with their &s;hields. The poor &s;ubdued Greeks, of the pre&s;entage, have nothing to do with the&s;e dances; but their ma&s;ters, the Turks, have thought proper to adopt them in their exerci&s;es; and are now the only people in Greece who exerci&s;e the Pyrrhic games. The mu&s;ic of the Pyrrhic dance, as performed at pre&s;ent in Con&s;tantinople, is plea&s;ing. A few remains of this dance, &s;ays <HI>Guys,</HI> are, however, yet to be found in that part of Greece, called Mag|ne&s;ia, and at Mi&s;itra; a country rendered famous by the Spartans. It is inhabited by a &s;avage people, of Greek de&s;cent, governed by their own laws; who, con&s;cious of their inability to attack a powerful em|pire, which, if provoked, might cru&s;h them, are con|tented with pre&s;erving their independence, and are now become the mo&s;t daring pirates of the Archipelago.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ionian dance;</HI> which, according to <HI>Athenaeus,</HI> was performed when the parties were a little exhila|rated
<PB N="296" REF="302">
by wine, may not be improperly mentioned in this cla&s;s, notwith&s;tanding it was more gentle and re|gular. It has a kind of tripping &s;tep, which is much in fa&s;hion at Smyrna, and in A&s;ia Minor; where a ta&s;te for la&s;civious dances always predominated. The Turks take great delight in the&s;e dances.</P>
<P>The Greeks have al&s;o the Wallachian dance, which is of very ancient date, in the country from whence the name is borrowed. This dance, which has but one uniform &s;tep, and different from every other, is very plea&s;ing when well executed. This dance, mo&s;t probably, is de&s;cended from the Dacians; who, for|merly inhabited Wallachia.</P>
<P>The games, or pa&s;times, are nearly allied to the dances. By games, we do not mean tho&s;e celebrated ones, which were the epochs of the mo&s;t glorious ages of the Greeks: they no longer exi&s;t. It is only of the pa&s;times of the modern Greeks, of the amu&s;ements of their young people, and even of their children, that we intend to treat. It will be nece&s;&s;ary, however, to advert to the inferior pa&s;times of the ancients, to &s;hew, that the origin of our mo&s;t trifling amu&s;ements, may be traced back to the earlie&s;t ages. From the ancients, we derive the game of even and odd, and other &s;imilar ones. <HI>Ludere par impar, equitare in arundine long&acirc;.</HI> Hor. Sat. iii. lib. 2.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="303">The Lydians, according to <HI>Herodotus,</HI> pa&s;s for the inventors of the&s;e games, and their origin is &s;ingular. Hunger had as great a &s;hare in giving birth to them, as indolence. The Lydians, under the reign of <HI>Athis,</HI> were afflicted with a cruel famine; and, to avoid the violent exerci&s;es, which excited a keener &s;en&s;e of hun|ger, they invented the games of dice and <HI>o&s;&s;elets,</HI> which are &s;till in u&s;e among the Greeks. It is played with little &s;hells, and in a box, where the re&s;pective players have their points before them. They call it the <HI>Mangala.</HI></P>
<P>The game of tennis, is likewi&s;e of Lydian extraction; a fatiguing game, which does not appear to corre&s;pond much with their intentions; except, that it helped, from the eagerne&s;s it excites to, what we call, kill time. The honour of inventing the game of che&s;s, is, by the ancients, univer&s;ally attributed, and from the &s;ame cau&s;e, to <HI>Palamedes.</HI> The lovers of <HI>Penelope,</HI> pa&s;&s;ed their time in the court of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> in playing at this game. They made u&s;e of dice and pebbles, and each had a &s;et of his own. A mark was placed in the mid|dle, which they called <HI>Penelope.</HI> This was the object at which they were all to take aim; and the players were ranged in equal numbers, at a con&s;iderable di&s;|tance, and oppo&s;ite to each other for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="304">The top, or gig, which <HI>Horace</HI> calls a Greek game, was formerly in great u&s;e.</P>
<P>The game of cro&s;s, or pile, bore anciently, the name of <HI>head,</HI> or <HI>&s;hip;</HI> the coin, at that time, being &s;truck with the head of <HI>Janus</HI> on one &s;ide, and a ve&s;&s;el or &s;hip on the other. The word pile, comes from the Greek word <HI>pilos,</HI> which &s;ignifies a &s;hip.</P>
<P>The game we call even or odd, was by the Greeks, called <HI>artios mon.</HI> They made u&s;e of nuts, al|monds, or pieces of money. The Romans, according to <HI>Horace,</HI> were fond of this game; <HI>equitare in arundine long&acirc;,</HI> or riding on a &s;tick, is a play which has been practi&s;ed in all countries. <HI>Age&s;ilaus</HI> and <HI>Socrates,</HI> are known to have amu&s;ed them&s;elves among the chil|dren, in running about with a long reed between their legs.</P>
<P>Nuts afforded the ancients a variety of games, which &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t with &s;ome little variations; indeed, it is not po&s;&s;ible that &s;uch &s;imple and voluntary games, &s;hould have any fixed exi&s;tence. <HI>Ovid</HI> has been very minute in his account of them.</P>
<P>The Greeks celebrate the fe&s;tival of the &s;pring, with great enthu&s;ia&s;m, as announcing the return of the zephyrs and ro&s;es. On this occa&s;ion, the children
<PB N="299" REF="305">
at Rhodes, demanded a tribute, and had a play and &s;ong, which they &s;till pre&s;erve. From thence, no doubt, comes the pre&s;ent cu&s;tom with us, of demand|ing a tribute on the fir&s;t of May; not for the &s;wallow, as formerly, but for the pretty maiden, who is dre&s;&s;ed out in her fine&s;t gown, and decorated with all the flowers of the &s;pring.</P>
<P>The children of Rhodes, went about in companies &s;inging and dancing, and demanded a gift of tho&s;e they met, for the &s;wallow that was newly arrived; from thence, the fe&s;tival had its name, from the Greek word <HI>Clidonia,</HI> or the &s;wallow. Their &s;ong began in this manner:
<Q><L>"See, &s;ee, the &s;wallow comes,</L>
<L>"And &s;pring with lovely days appears.</L></Q></P>
<P>The &s;aw, is a game much in vogue with the Greeks. The youth of both &s;exes, particularly the girls, take great delight in it, while the fine weather la&s;ts; and as they balance them&s;elves, repeat alternately, &s;uch airs as they have been taught to &s;ing. The Greeks called this game <HI>aioras;</HI> and the Latins, <HI>o&s;cilla.</HI></P>
<P>Another game of the ancients &s;till in u&s;e, is to draw a circle upon a large table, or on the floor; and to win, it was nece&s;&s;ary to throw a die, or &s;mall pellet,
<PB N="300" REF="306">
from a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, into the middle of the circle. Sometimes a quail was put into it; and he, who, by &s;triking him with the finger only, made him quit the circle, &s;o that the bird pa&s;&s;ed the boundaries of it, either in retreating back, or in touching the ex|tremity of it with the tip of his wings; if he extended them he was the winner. They likewi&s;e practi&s;e ano|ther play with the quail, by tying it to a little &s;take, and taking every one a &s;tick in his hand; each in his turn, being blindfolded, is obliged to go twenty or thirty yards from the bird; and if, on his return he can hit the bird, he is conqueror.</P>
<P>The Greeks &s;till play at blind-man's-buff; an an|cient, and formerly, an univer&s;al game all over Greece. It was formerly called <HI>muinda.</HI> They put an earthen pot into the hands of the per&s;on who was muffled; the others run about provoking him, and crying out, <HI>Who has the pot?</HI> He an&s;wers, <HI>Midas has it,</HI> and the per&s;on he can lay hold of, is obliged, in his turn, to be blinded and take it.</P>
<P>The Greeks &s;till continue the <HI>hop.</HI> He who goes furthe&s;t on one leg, without re&s;ting, is the winner. The likewi&s;e fold the leaves of ro&s;es and poppies, into the &s;hape of little bladders, in order to &s;mack them upon the forehead; and, by the noi&s;e they make, judge of the degrees of affection in their lover.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="307">The paintings of Herculaneum, recal to mind the barbarous cu&s;tom of whipping and beating children; which, unhappily, is the practice of <HI>our</HI> &s;chools, as well as the Greek. What &s;ort of fathers mu&s;t tho&s;e be, who commit, to a &s;tranger, the power of inflicting at his own will, an ignominious and public cha&s;ti&s;e|ment upon their children? Who would have &s;uppo|&s;ed, this practice could have prevailed in any nation, except where rigorous puni&s;hments were u&s;ed in cor|recting &s;laves? I have &s;een, &s;ays <HI>Guys,</HI> the parents in Greece, hold out the rod to their children when they offended, as if no method could be devi&s;ed, but that of puni&s;hing them like &s;laves. From the Greeks, is derived that &s;hameful practice of &s;choolma&s;ters; who, &s;o indecently, bare the backs of innocent children. At the &s;ame time, that they impre&s;s marks of the great|e&s;t cruelty upon their tender bodies, they render their minds callous to that &s;en&s;e of &s;hame, which &s;hould ever predominate in liberal minds. Here then we have, the origin of tho&s;e torturing in&s;truments, &s;o lavi&s;hly inflicted by the pedantic tyrants; which <HI>Mar|tial,</HI> not improperly, calls <HI>&s;ceptra pedagorum.</HI> The cu&s;|tom of ancient Greece, was to fa&s;ten the child to a po&s;t, or to have him held by &s;ome per&s;on, in the Eng|li&s;h method of <HI>hor&s;ing,</HI> while the ma&s;ter was mauling his fle&s;h. This &s;pecies of puni&s;hment, was called <HI>catomium;</HI> a cu&s;tom, which, to the reproach of man|kind, has ever &s;ince been in practice. Perhaps, to
<PB N="302" REF="308">
glut the &s;anguine di&s;po&s;itions of tho&s;e ma&s;ters, who are are de&s;irous of making repri&s;als on the backs of others, for what they had &s;uffered on their own; the&s;e wretches exerci&s;e the &s;ame inhumanity in their turn on the tender delicacy of youth; which, on the con|trary, demands all po&s;&s;ible indulgence and regard.</P>
<P>To di&s;cover the &s;ucce&s;s of their amours, the Greeks no longer apply the leaves of ro&s;es; which, as <HI>Ana|creon</HI> informs us, they did by &s;macking them between the hands, and which the children do at pre&s;ent; it is the <HI>Clidona,</HI> which now di&s;covers every thing, and the oracle which the Greek youth con&s;ult.</P>
<P>On the evening of the day appointed for this ce|remony, two girls, to whom the management of it is confided, apply to the young men and maids, de&s;irous of being concerned in it; from each of whom, they are to receive a pledge of &s;ome kind or other; &s;uch as a ring, a piece of money, &amp;c. which are afterwards put into a va&s;e. The&s;e conductre&s;&s;es, then fill the va&s;e with water, from &s;ome &s;acred fountain, and cover it with myrtle and laurel leaves, ob&s;erving the mo&s;t pro|found &s;ilence during the whole time. The va&s;e is afterwards expo&s;ed in the open air, and carefully at|tended till the next morning. The parties concerned being then a&s;&s;embled, one of the ve&s;tals opens the va&s;e, while the other &s;ings, or recites a couplet of lines,
<PB N="303" REF="309">
compo&s;ed for the game, which is called the overture of the <HI>Clidona.</HI> Each per&s;on in turn, is now required to recite a Greek di&s;tich, while they draw one of the pledges from the va&s;e: this di&s;tich, is con&s;idered as an an&s;wer to his or her enquiry, to whom the pledge be|longs. Sometimes, when many of the parties are di&s;|&s;atisfied, all the pledges are again put into the va&s;e, and the game re-commenced. This is but a repeti|tion of the fir&s;t play; except that the players, often|times being &s;oured and di&s;gu&s;ted with a &s;econd in&s;tance of ill fortune, dive&s;t them&s;elves of all regard to de|cency, and utter &s;uch abandoned &s;entiments in the couplets they recite, as to oblige all tho&s;e to retire, who have the lea&s;t &s;en&s;e of delicacy.</P>
<P>The young Greeks, of both &s;exes, know by heart a great number of the&s;e couplets and &s;ongs, of all kinds, which they repeat with wonderful facility. There are al&s;o tragedies written in modern Greek; which only &s;erve to &s;hew the great difference, between the an|cient and modern Mu&s;es.</P>
<P>The cu&s;tom of bathing, &s;o frequent among the an|cient Greeks, is not le&s;s &s;o among the moderns. It is practi&s;ed, at pre&s;ent, with all the <HI>minutioe</HI> of former times. Be&s;ides the public baths, which are generally much frequented, per&s;ons of condition have them in their hou&s;es. They pa&s;s immediately from the bath
<PB N="304" REF="310">
to the couch, on which they take their repa&s;t; from thence, mo&s;t probably, came the ancient cu&s;tom of eating in a carele&s;s recumbent po&s;ture.</P>
<P>The Greeks took but one repa&s;t in the four and twenty hours, which was in the evening; and the u&s;e of the bath immediately preceded the entertainment. A practice continued through &s;ucceeding ages to the pre&s;ent time. The attachment of this people, to local cu&s;toms, is worthy of imitation. The ancients never u&s;ed any but the hot baths. The Turks and modern Greeks follow their example.</P>
<P>"We are fond of magnificence, in dre&s;s, &s;ays <HI>Al|cinous</HI> to <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> delight in the hot baths, in gallantry, and in dancing." The modern Greeks may &s;ay the &s;ame. If the u&s;e of hot baths is pernicious to beauty, as it is generally repre&s;ented to be, the force of cu&s;tom mu&s;t be wonderful; &s;ince the women have ever fol|lowed the ancients in this particular. But it is cer|tainly very &s;alutary to the con&s;titution, and particu|larly to that of old per&s;ons, whom it &s;trengthens, in|&s;tead of enfeebling; by facilitating that gentle and nece&s;&s;ary per&s;piration; which, otherwi&s;e, is with dif|ficulty performed, by rea&s;on of the dryne&s;s of their &s;kin; the pores of which, are clo&s;er than tho&s;e of younger men. It is certain, the u&s;e of the hot bath prevents many of tho&s;e di&s;orders, which attack men
<PB N="305" REF="311">
of an advanced age; and that di&s;orders of the brea&s;t are very rare among this people.</P>
<P>The Greeks and Turks, particularly the women, make u&s;e of a glutinous kind of earth, to wa&s;h their head and hair with, while in the bath. It is found in the i&s;lands of the Archipelago, and on the coa&s;t of the Black Sea. The Greeks formerly u&s;ed the &s;ame kind of earth, for wa&s;hing linen; and it &s;upplied the place of &s;oap. <HI>Pliny</HI> takes notice of the <HI>Ghian earth,</HI> which the women, he &s;ays, made u&s;e of for the hair and &s;kin. It is u&s;ed by the modern Greeks, for the &s;kin; which, by gently rubbing, it renders &s;ofter and more &s;mooth. Ghio, anciently Cius, is a city of Bythinia, near the gulf of Mondagna. <HI>Belon,</HI> who travelled through Greece, in 1546, in a di&s;cour&s;e, entitled, <HI>Que les femmes de Turquie &s;ont belles par &s;ingularit&eacute;, et nettes comme perles,</HI> mentions a pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Dio&s;corides,</HI> that this earth, which &s;oftened the &s;kin, gave al&s;o a fre&s;hne&s;s to the complexion.</P>
<P>The Greek women bathe, at lea&s;t, once in every month; formerly, the laws pre&s;cribed it oftener. &mdash; At the <HI>neomenia,</HI> or new moon, they never failed to per|form this obligation.</P>

<P>WE may ea&s;ily conclude, that a people devoted to fe&s;tivals, could not proceed to &s;olemnize the marriage, without adding all the brilliancy and decorations, of which, &s;uch an event is &s;u&s;ceptible. Among the mo&s;t &s;avage nations, we find, that men ce|lebrate the day on which they form a la&s;ting attach|ment with the fair, as the mo&s;t joyful and important of their lives. But, to exhibit marriage under the mo&s;t plea&s;ing a&s;pect, we &s;hould pre&s;ent it with &s;implicity of manners; and, accompanied with the gaiety, purity,
<PB N="307" REF="313">
and innocence, with which that rite was performed in the earlie&s;t times. The Greeks of the pre&s;ent age, adverting to the cu&s;toms of the ancients, have re|tained mo&s;t of the ceremonies, which were formerly u&s;ed in the celebration of nuptials. They con&s;idered an early entrance into the marriage, as the indi&s;pen|&s;able duty of a good citizen; and, therefore, engaged in it very young. The laws of Sparta, were extremely rigorous, in marking tho&s;e for infamy, who remained in a &s;tate of celibacy. At Sparta, upon the celebra|tion of a certain fe&s;tival, the women were permitted to &s;eize the young men who remained unmarried; to drag them before the altars, and to cha&s;ti&s;e them with whips.</P>
<P>The cha&s;te <HI>Theognis</HI> told the Greeks, "That he was the riche&s;t and happie&s;t man, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a gen|tle and virtuous wife. But why con&s;ult philo&s;ophy, which often becomes embarra&s;&s;ed, and falls into an un|certainty wor&s;e than the darke&s;t ignorance? A young man applying to <HI>Socrates,</HI> for his opinion, whe|ther he &s;hould marry or not, was told by the philo&s;o|pher, 'That, to which ever opinion he adhered, he would infallibly repent. If he preferred a life of ce|libacy, that he would not enjoy the plea&s;ure of having children of his own, and that his wealth would go to a &s;tranger. If he took a wife, that he might expect eternal vexation and endle&s;s &s;trife. If &s;he was well
<PB N="308" REF="314">
dowered, ince&s;&s;ant reproaches mu&s;t be expected on that head. The pride al&s;o of her relations, and the tongue of his &s;tep-mother, would become in&s;upport|able; and, if hand&s;ome, that he would have to dread her gallantry, and be in continual doubt as to the pa|ternity of his children.' After this, &s;ays the &s;age,
<Q>'Let him judge if he can, and chu&s;e if he dare.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Themi&s;tocles</HI> being a&s;ked by a rich man, who had an only daughter, whom he &s;hould prefer as a hu&s;band for her; a man of character without a fortune; or, one who was rich, but a &s;coundrel. I &s;hould rather, re|plied <HI>Themi&s;tocles,</HI> have a man without money, than money without a man.</P>
<P>The modern Greek has no philo&s;ophers to con|&s;ult; and, therefore, no deliberations about marriage. Hence, population is better promoted among the Greeks than the Turks. The latter al&s;o, living under a military government, de&s;troy without remor&s;e, but never think of repairing. From this cau&s;e, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable cities of Greece, have never been re|built by their conquerors. Beneficence and vanity, have, indeed, produced among the Turks, a few pub|lic edifices. But, in a country where property is held by &s;uch precarious tenure, they can have no idea of perpetuating any po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; nor can they contemplate
<PB N="309" REF="315">
the &s;ituation of their po&s;terity, with &s;atisfaction or tranquility.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Greek, the Armenian, and the Jew; people that abound in the Turki&s;h empire, and whom the Turks hold in &s;uch contempt, as not to fear the number of their &s;laves, abandon them&s;elves to their natural inclinations. The&s;e confide in the hope of a numerous po&s;terity, who &s;hall, at &s;ome fu|ture period, recover all tho&s;e territories which the conquerors of Greece have ravaged from them. Marriage mu&s;t, of cour&s;e, be an in&s;titution favourable to their hopes; and celibacy is, accordingly, very rare among them.</P>
<P>The modern Greeks have no fixed &s;ea&s;ons for the celebration of their nuptials. The ancients u&s;ually celebrated them in the month of January; from thence, called <HI>Gamelion;</HI> but they have, as formerly, mediatrices whom they &s;till call <HI>Proxenetes;</HI> and the&s;e are as nece&s;&s;ary as ever. For the young women being almo&s;t con&s;tantly immer&s;ed in the <HI>Gynaeceon,</HI> a man can decide on the merits of the lady, who is propo&s;ed to him, only by the report he receives from the me|diatrix. The moment a lady has dropped her veil to any man, he is engaged to her beyond the power of retracting.</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="316">Anciently, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a woman was only to be purcha&s;ed, by a term of actual &s;ervitude to the father. That impo&s;ition was afterwards removed, and the &s;er|vitude converted into certain pre&s;ents. Still, &s;ays <HI>Monte&s;quieu,</HI> the cu&s;tom prevails among the Greeks, that he who marries, &s;hould purcha&s;e his wife by pre|&s;ents made to her parents.</P>
<P>A Greek, &s;ays <HI>Guys,</HI> no doubt, always makes pre&s;ents to the bride; the&s;e, however, are neither obligatory, nor as the purcha&s;e of his wife, but &s;pontaneous. He would not, mo&s;t probably, have taken her without a portion &s;uitable to her condition.</P>
<P>The ancient Greeks, always &s;crupulous ob&s;ervers of the primitive laws of marriage, abhorred bigamy. <HI>Euripides</HI> makes <HI>Hermione,</HI> in the tragedy, &s;ay, "It is contrary to good order, that two women &s;hould be at the &s;ame time under the dominion of one man." <HI>Cha|rondas</HI> went further in the code he formed for the Thurians. The&s;e, according to <HI>Diodorus,</HI> he directs, that tho&s;e who bring a &s;tepmother to their children, &s;hould be excluded the public councils. He judged, that men capable of rendering &s;uch an ill office to their family, could have no good intention towards their country. "For, &s;ays he, if the fir&s;t marriage has been happy, there they &s;hould &s;top. On the con|trary, if it has been mi&s;erable, they mu&s;t be mad to
<PB N="311" REF="317">
ri&s;k a &s;econd engagement." The Greeks of the pre|&s;ent time, though le&s;s free than their ance&s;tors, would not &s;ubmit to &s;uch a re&s;traint as the Thurian code impo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Unequal matches were as common, in former times, as in the pre&s;ent. "A man of rank, &s;ays <HI>Theognis,</HI> &s;toops to e&s;pou&s;e a rich woman who di&s;|honours him; and a virtuous girl, marries a villain for his wealth. They, the good and bad, are promi&s;|cuou&s;ly joined; and, from thence &s;prings a degenerate race."</P>
<P><HI>Tele&s;icles,</HI> father of the famous <HI>Archilocus,</HI> tarni&s;hed the lu&s;tre of his birth, by a di&s;proportioned marriage with <HI>Enipo,</HI> a &s;lave. The Greeks, &s;ays the Abb&eacute; <HI>Sewin,</HI> in commenting on this pa&s;&s;age, beheld unequal al|liances with &s;overeign contempt; and the &s;hame was often reflected on their children. Modern Greeks, call the offspring of &s;uch marriages, the children of a &s;lave. They ob&s;erve exactly, the ancient precept, <HI>&s;i vis nubere, nube pari;</HI> if you will marry, marry an equal; &s;o well illu&s;trated by the epigram of <HI>Calli|machus,</HI> and carefully avoid di&s;graceful alliances.</P>
<P>Among the Greeks, the ceremony of marriage is preceded by fe&s;tivals. The ancients, called them <HI>prolu&s;oria,</HI> the &s;ame appellation that they gave the
<PB N="312" REF="318">
preludes of the &s;olemn &s;acrifices to <HI>Juno</HI> and <HI>Diana.</HI> Marriage, &s;ays a &s;hepherd of <HI>Theocritus,</HI> brings neither cares nor vexation, but is always attended by mirth and fe&s;tivity.</P>
<P><HI>Homer</HI> has de&s;cribed the ceremonial of nuptial pageants, on the famous &s;hield of <HI>Achilles.</HI> The bride and bridegroom going from their hou&s;e, are received by numbers of per&s;ons, ranged in the mo&s;t exact order, who conduct them through the &s;treets with a blaze of torches; the air re&s;ounding with the chant of hymeneal &s;ongs. Some precede, others follow the proce&s;&s;ion, dancing to the melody of flutes and trumpets.</P>
<P>The Greeks &s;till ob&s;erve the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition in their nuptial proce&s;&s;ions. Numerous attendants, and mu&s;ic, are always to be found upon the&s;e occa&s;ions. The proce&s;&s;ions are generally opened, to the harmony of a variety of in&s;truments, and with dancing. The bride profu&s;ely adorned, with looks aba&s;hed, pro|ceeds in a &s;olemn pace, &s;upported by her friends and neare&s;t relations; during which, the epithalamium is performing. The bride, formerly, wore a red or yellow veil; a cu&s;tom &s;till continued by the Arme|nians. This veil, called <HI>flammeum,</HI> covers the head, and de&s;cends almo&s;t to the feet.</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="319">The &s;plendid torch of <HI>Hymen;</HI> that torch, &s;o well known and celebrated by the poets, even to con&s;e|cration, as an emblem of marriage, &s;till maintains its place among the modern Greeks. This torch blazes in their proce&s;&s;ions, and is an attendant afterwards on the bridal bed. There it is placed, to wait the ar|rival of the new married pair; and remains until the whole is con&s;umed. If, by any accident, it &s;hould become extingui&s;hed, the mo&s;t unfortunate pre&s;ages would be drawn; to prevent which, unremitting vigi|lance is u&s;ed. The &s;acred fire could not be more at|tentively watched by the ve&s;tals.</P>
<P>Among the ancient Greeks, the nuptial torch was carried by the mother of the bride. It was her office to prepare, and adorn the bridal bed; &s;he officiated as <HI>pronuba,</HI> and led the bride to her chamber: as the neare&s;t relation, &s;he acted likewi&s;e as <HI>paranymphus,</HI> and conducted the bridegroom in like manner.</P>
<P>The <HI>pronuba</HI> and <HI>paranymphus,</HI> are repre&s;ented by the modern Greeks, in the per&s;ons of the marriage &s;pon&s;ors, who accompany the married pair through every part of the ceremony.</P>
<P>The bride and bridegroom, before their pre&s;enta|tion at the altar, are each adorned with a crown, or chaplet; which, during the ceremony, is changed by
<PB N="314" REF="320">
the prie&s;t. He fir&s;t pre&s;ents the man with the crown taken from his wife, and then delivers that of the man to her. This ceremony, which has its origin from the ancients, is &s;till practi&s;ed by the moderns.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t part of the dowry con&s;i&s;ts in precious &s;tones, and in magnificent dre&s;&s;es, which are exhibited with uncommon o&s;tentation.</P>
<P>In this, they follow the ancient Greeks. <HI>Hermione</HI> &s;ays, in <HI>Andromache,</HI> "The ornaments of gold which now adorn my head, and that variety of robes I po&s;|&s;e&s;s, came to me neither from <HI>Achilles,</HI> nor from <HI>Peleus,</HI> I brought them from Sparta. <HI>Menelaus,</HI> my father, pre&s;ented them to me, with a dowry &s;till more con&s;i|derable; to the end, that I might &s;peak with freedom."</P>
<P>The Grecians celebrate their marriage fea&s;ts, with various diver&s;ions of dancing, and play. Vaulters, and tumblers, are provided at tho&s;e times, to enter|tain the gue&s;ts, with exertions of &s;trength and agility. <HI>Homer</HI> paints a &s;cene of this kind, in a manner much re&s;embling the moderns. <HI>Telemachus,</HI> and the &s;on of <HI>Ne&s;tor,</HI> arrived at the court of <HI>Menelaus,</HI> whil&s;t he was celebrating the marriage of his daughter. They found him at table among his friends; the palace re|&s;ounding with the cries of joy, mixed with the melody of various in&s;truments, and the loud choru&s;&s;es of the
<PB N="315" REF="321">
&s;ingers. One performer, di&s;tingui&s;hed in a circle, introduced, &s;ays a poet, by the &s;kilful touch of his lyre, the mo&s;t divine harmony; whil&s;t the vaulters, and buffoons, by dances of agility, &s;urpa&s;&s;ing belief, a&s;toni&s;hed and delighted the whole a&s;&s;embly. This &s;pecies of dancing, was, in &s;ub&s;equent times, deemed licentious: and the council of Laodicea, held about the year 367, thought it&s;elf obliged to prohibit &s;uch kind of dances, at the celebration of nuptials.</P>
<P>Among the Greeks, a widow &s;eldom re-marries. According to <HI>Pau&s;anias,</HI> &s;econd marriages were forbid|den by the ancients. He &s;ays, al&s;o, that <HI>Gorgophona,</HI> who married <HI>Oebalus,</HI> was the fir&s;t in&s;tance of a woman e&s;|pou&s;ing a &s;econd hu&s;band.</P>
<P>The modern Greeks are, by their religion, &s;olemnly enjoined continence, the fir&s;t night of marriage. The fourth council of Carthage, held after the defeat of <HI>Gildon,</HI> in 398, at which, St. <HI>Augu&s;tin,</HI> with one hun|dred and fourteen bi&s;hops, a&s;&s;i&s;ted, directed, that the married pair, out of re&s;pect to the holy &s;acrament of marriage, &s;hould, on the fir&s;t night, ob&s;erve the mo&s;t rigid forbearance of nuptial plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>A bride bears the &s;ame appellation among the modern Greeks, by which &s;he was di&s;tingui&s;hed among the ancients. She is called, by tho&s;e of her
<PB N="316" REF="322">
own family, from the Greek word <HI>neumphae,</HI> nymph. <HI>Penelope</HI> &s;ays, in <HI>Ovid</HI>'s epi&s;tles, that, "Nymphs &s;peak|ing of the brides, joyfully bear their offsprings to the altars; that the gods may pre&s;erve their hu&s;bands." <HI>Grata ferunt nymphae, pro &s;alvis dona maritis.</HI></P>
<P>The art of phy&s;ic is not only exerci&s;ed by the women, in mo&s;t of the Greek i&s;lands; but the deli|very of women in child-birth, is their peculiar pro|vince; the appearance of a &s;urgeon, on &s;uch occa|&s;ions, being extremely obnoxious to the Greek women. <HI>Monte&s;quieu,</HI> who has made the mo&s;t profound re|&s;earches into ancient cu&s;toms, has not omitted to re|late the account of a young female Athenian; who, when the republic had pro&s;cribed the practice of phy|&s;ic, or midwifry to that &s;ex, di&s;gui&s;ed her&s;elf in the habit of a man, to learn the ob&s;tetric art, that &s;he might be enabled to relieve the women from the em|barra&s;&s;ments they &s;uffered, in being compelled, to &s;eek a&s;&s;i&s;tance from men, on occa&s;ions of child-birth: their delicacy being &s;o great, in &s;uch ca&s;es, that many of them peri&s;hed for want of a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The young fe|male Athenian, found no rea&s;on to complain of want of bu&s;ine&s;s, in her newly acquired art; on the con|trary, the whole practice of the faculty centered in her: from whence &s;u&s;picions, which were &s;oon after verified. She was brought before the court of the Areopagus, to an&s;wer for her conduct. <HI>Agnodice,</HI>
<PB N="317" REF="323">
for that was her name, had no great difficulty in ju&s;ti|fying her proceedings. She confe&s;&s;ed the di&s;gui&s;e, but produced the mo&s;t authentic te&s;timony, of her having a&s;&s;umed it, generally, for the benefit of human nature; and of her friends in particular. The ju&s;|tice of the court, admitted her excu&s;e; the pro&s;crip|tion was taken off; and the women were permitted to follow the profe&s;&s;ion without re&s;traint, which they have ever &s;ince continued to practi&s;e. A midwife, is a character greatly e&s;teemed by the modern Greeks.</P>
<P>Conjugal affection is to be found in as great a degree, among the modern Greeks, as in the de&s;criptions we meet of it, in the times of ancient Greece. All that <HI>Claudian</HI> &s;ays, of the dignity of the mother, who, by that title alone, pre&s;erved the &s;ame rank in her hu&s;|band's affections, which the attractions of her youth had before obtained, is exactly verified in the pre&s;ent age.</P>
<P>Paternal affection, and filial affection, are al&s;o vir|tues &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, and without the lea&s;t diminution in Greece. They &s;hone, it is true, with greater lu&s;tre in the fir&s;t ages; becau&s;e poets paid more attention to them. <HI>Homer,</HI> when he de&s;cribes the joy of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> at the pro&s;pect of his &s;afety, after having been floating a long time on the waves, compares it to that of a child, beholding its father, whom it tenderly loved,
<PB N="318" REF="324">
re&s;tored to health, after a long and de&s;perate illne&s;s, which had reduced him to the brink of the grave. 'And &s;uch, &s;ays <HI>Homer,</HI> was the joy of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> when he fir&s;t got a&s;hore.</P>
<P>Ho&s;pitality is another virtue, in which the Greeks are never deficient. The arrival of a &s;tranger, puts the whole hou&s;e in gala, and the be&s;t apartments are de&s;tined for his u&s;e.</P>
<P>The primitive chri&s;tians were the fir&s;t who practi&s;ed ho&s;pitality, after the example of the Greeks and Ro|mans. Among the latter, inns were frequented, but by the lowe&s;t cla&s;s of vagabonds only. Per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, or reputation, never travelled without let|ters of recommendation, to all the towns through which their affairs required them to pa&s;s. The per|&s;ons to whom the&s;e letters were addre&s;&s;ed, always re|ceived, and lodged &s;uch travellers in their hou&s;es. This intercour&s;e of recommendation, as the <HI>Abb&eacute; Fleury</HI> ob&s;erves, became, in proce&s;s of time, hereditary to the different parts of Greece and Italy; and joined the natives in the &s;tronge&s;t bands of friend&s;hip and al|liance. They even regarded ho&s;pitality as a duty of religion. <HI>Jupiter</HI> him&s;elf, pre&s;ided at the ho&s;pitable fea&s;t. And not only the table provided for the gue&s;ts, but the per&s;on of the &s;tranger, was &s;acred in all places.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="325"><HI>Diodorus</HI> relates, that <HI>Gellius,</HI> the riche&s;t man in Agrigentum, retained a certain number of dome&s;tics, for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of inviting all &s;trangers, to come and take up their lodgings at his hou&s;e; and, that &s;everal of his fellow-citizens followed his example in a certain degree.</P>

<P>HAVING now &s;een the Greeks on their days of fe&s;tivity and marriage; we &s;hall draw a por|trait of them in tears, lamentation, and &s;orrow. Such, indeed, are the tran&s;ient pa&s;&s;ages of this &s;hort life, that one generally follows on the foot&s;teps of the other. In Greece, we no &s;ooner quit the jocund revels of the laughing meadows, but we encounter &s;ome dreary walk, planted on either &s;ide with the mournful cypre&s;s. It is, &s;ometimes, even plea&s;ant to repo&s;e under its gloomy &s;hade.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="326">Follow me into that hou&s;e, &s;ays <HI>Guys,</HI> where the piercing cries of the &s;laves, and dome&s;tics, proclaim the approach of death! See'&s;t thou not a woman; who, &s;wooning, is &s;upported in the arms of her atten|dants? She is a di&s;tracted mother, who&s;e daughter has this in&s;tant given up the gho&s;t. Her grief too mighty to be endured in &s;ilence, forces its way in loud exclamations. Her attendants an&s;wer with bitter &s;ighs, and floods of tears. Hear her cries:</P>
<P>'O my child! my daughter! Thou who fir&s;t gave me a right to the tender name of mother! Thou, who no &s;ooner &s;awe&s;t the light, but, crying, I received thee into my arms; art now deaf to the cries of thy pa|rent! The&s;e cries, &s;hall pierce the very inmo&s;t rece&s;s of the tomb, where thou art going to de&s;cend; even the highe&s;t heaven &s;hall hear them! It is thy mother calls. My child! My child did I &s;ay? My &s;oul, my life; the prop of my exi&s;tence! And, can'&s;t thou abandon me thus? Has life for&s;aken thee in the &s;trength of thy age, and in the flower of thy youth? No, thou only &s;lumbere&s;t. A profound and tranquil &s;leep has &s;eized thee. It is I who die; grief has rob|bed me of life. O &s;leep of death! Eternal &s;leep! Night more horrible than the clo&s;e of creation! Thy &s;hadows &s;urround me; thou has ravi&s;hed from me a daughter, who will never return! Let me follow her; re-unite me with all I held dear in the world! Bar|barians,
<PB N="321" REF="327">
why do you interrupt me? Why do you pre|vent me? I go to &s;eek my child; &s;he is waiting for me. Hark! She calls! She is not dead; for pity's &s;ake do not undeceive me! At lea&s;t, I will embrace her cold-clay cor&s;e. Perhaps, the mother's touch may rai&s;e it again to action; renew the &s;prings of life! &mdash;Oh heaven! no!&mdash;The cries of death, and the di&s;|mal echo of bewailings, too fatally pronounce my error. Now, now, they tear her from me.&mdash;Stop your your hands, barbarians.&mdash;I go.&mdash;Support me, my deare&s;t child. I come, Thou dragge&s;t me with thee into the tomb of death!"</P>
<P>The afflicted mother, in this &s;tate of di&s;traction, fol|lows the funeral proce&s;&s;ion. The neare&s;t relations and friends attend it, as heretofore; women and girls, with hair di&s;hevelled, and weeping, follow. Being arrived at the place of interment, their tears then flow mo&s;t copiou&s;ly. This al&s;o agrees with the ancients, as re|lated in the fir&s;t &s;cene of the Andrian.</P>
<P>The Greeks conform to the ancient cu&s;tom of wa&s;hing the body before interment; in which, they are followed by the Turks. They hire, as formerly, a certain number of women, who walk in proce&s;&s;ion before the body; tearing their hair, and &s;inging the prai&s;es of the decea&s;ed. In <HI>Euripides,</HI> they will not believe the death of <HI>Alce&s;te;</HI> becau&s;e the proxy for the
<PB N="322" REF="328">
people, or the choir, &s;ays, "I &s;ee no water prepared to wa&s;h the body; no tearing of hair; neither do I hear the cries of women; circum&s;tances which always make part of the funeral ob&s;equies."</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent, when a death happens, the women of the hou&s;e cry without cea&s;ing; and, for a con&s;ider|able time, refu&s;e either nouri&s;hment or &s;leep. For|merly, the women expre&s;&s;ed their grief on the&s;e oc|ca&s;ions, by plucking off their hair, and rending their garments. The gentle <HI>Hero,</HI> perceiving the body of her dear <HI>Leander,</HI> floating at the break of day, upon the &s;ea, begins to tear her ve&s;tments; and, with the mo&s;t piercing cries, takes leave of the world. Then, plunging into the &s;ea, &s;he &s;hares the fate of her be|loved hu&s;band.</P>
<P>The myrmidons, and <HI>Bri&s;eis</HI> her&s;elf, tore off the hair, and covered the tomb of <HI>Achilles</HI> with it. The Greek women &s;till act the &s;ame part; but this is now principally confined to hired mourners.</P>
<P>The Greeks formerly conceived, that inju&s;tice was done to the decea&s;ed, by keeping the body a long time, above ground. At pre&s;ent, interment follows the death with all po&s;&s;ible expedition.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="329">When a virgin dies, the body is dre&s;&s;ed in the rich|e&s;t habits of the decea&s;ed; and the head crowned with flowers. The women throw ro&s;es, and &s;catter &s;cented waters on the bier, as it pa&s;&s;es along the &s;treets.</P>
<P>Anciently, the corp&s;e was decorated with &s;everal crowns of flowers, as marks of triumph; to &s;hew, that the decea&s;ed had, at length, &s;urmounted the mi|&s;eries and vexation of life. For which rea&s;on, a cor&s;e was called, <HI>e&s;tephanomenon, i. e.</HI> "crowned." The &s;urvivors of the famous Greek &s;oldiers, who &s;erved under <HI>Xenophon,</HI> in A&s;iatic Thrace; after hav|ing buried their decea&s;ed friends, erected a CENO|TAPHIUM, and a grand funeral pile, on which they &s;cattered crowns of flowers. <HI>Xen. de Cyr. Exped.</HI> l.vi. c. 5. In <HI>Ari&s;tophanes,</HI> a woman &s;ays, "Receive this crown from me. A &s;econd, and a third, let me pre&s;ent you with this. <HI>Charon</HI> waits for you." The&s;e crowns are de&s;cribed in the <HI>bas reliefs</HI> of <HI>M. de Pey|&s;onnel,</HI> as are al&s;o the nuptial crowns. In the collec|tion of <HI>Comte de Caylus,</HI> is a &s;imilar <HI>bas relief. Menius</HI> lying dead, appears crowned by his &s;on: <HI>Neopolis,</HI> his wife, who died &s;ome time before, al&s;o lies crowned by one of her relations.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t not omit the funeral fea&s;ts. <HI>Demo&s;thenes,</HI> in his harangue for <HI>Cte&s;iphon,</HI> where he &s;o vain-glo|riou&s;ly boa&s;ts of being cho&s;en in preference to <HI>E&s;|chines,</HI>
<PB N="324" REF="330">
and other fountains of eloquence, to deliver the funeral oration, for tho&s;e who were killed at the famous battle of Chaeronea, &s;ays, "Not to the pub|lic voice alone, am I obliged for my election to this honourable office. The parents and brothers of the decea&s;ed, who&s;e duty it was to take charge of their funeral ob&s;equies, joined their unanimous &s;uffrages, that I &s;hould be appointed. Even the funeral repa&s;t, which our religion has enjoined, &s;hall be conducted at the hou&s;e of the decea&s;ed's neare&s;t relation, was made under my roof. Upon whom, indeed, could their honours be &s;o properly conferred, as upon him who had the care of their eternal fame."</P>
<P>The funeral fea&s;t is neglected by the modern Greeks. The neare&s;t relation is charged with the preparation; and the&s;e terminate the funeral cere|mony.</P>
<P>Parents, we have already remarked, always follow their children to the tomb. On &s;uch intere&s;ting oc|ca&s;ions, the public expect to be witne&s;&s;es of the pangs felt by an incon&s;iderable parent. <HI>Sappho,</HI> to expre&s;s her &s;orrows in the ab&s;ence of <HI>Phaon,</HI> tells us, &s;he has pierced the air with her cries; and torn the hair from off her. To paint the exce&s;s of her grief in &s;tronger colours, &s;he compares her&s;elf to a mother, follow|ing
<PB N="325" REF="331">
the di&s;mal proce&s;&s;ion of her child's funeral, over|whelmed with mi&s;ery, and di&s;&s;olving in tears.</P>
<P>In Greece, they mourn a con&s;iderable time for their children. The cu&s;tom is very ancient in this country. Among numberle&s;s examples, one may &s;uffice. And this <HI>E&s;chines</HI> has furni&s;hed us, in that &s;peech, where he employs all his art to render <HI>De|mo&s;thenes</HI> obnoxious to the Athenians. "This wretch, &s;peaking of <HI>Demo&s;thenes,</HI> in le&s;s than &s;even days after the death of his daughter, and before he had paid one tribute of &s;orrow to her memory, or any of tho&s;e duties, which nature and the laws of his country re|quire, appeared publickly, crowned with flowers, and habited in the &s;plendid dre&s;s of an a&s;&s;i&s;tant at a fe&s;tival; thereby mo&s;t &s;candalou&s;ly violating every ordinance of the gods and men. Not even the remembrance of that precious gift, which the immortals had be&s;towed on him, and the only opportunity he ever enjoyed of being called, by the tender appellation of father, could re&s;train him from &s;o gro&s;s an act of impiety. I &s;peak not with a de&s;ign to in&s;ult his misfortunes; but to make the world acquainted with his true character."</P>
<P>The learned notes of <HI>M. Tourreuil,</HI> who has tran&s;|lated this author, prove, by many quotations from the Greek writers, that parents always wore mourning on the death of their children. <HI>Iphigenia,</HI> preparing
<PB N="326" REF="332">
for the &s;acrifice, &s;ays in her prayer, "Do not after my death, either cut your hair, or a&s;&s;ume the habit of mourning." She a&s;ks the &s;ame favour of her &s;i&s;ters.</P>
<P>Thus, to whatever &s;ide we turn our attention, we &s;hall find, that this people re&s;embled each other in all ages. The Greeks of the pre&s;ent age, are the Greeks of any pa&s;t period. And yet this truth, &s;ays <HI>Guys,</HI> &s;tands in need of new proofs, to undeceive tho&s;e, who &s;till think that merit is only to be found among the ancients.</P>
<P>The tombs of the Greeks, like tho&s;e of the Turks, and other oriental nations, are &s;ituated on the high-roads leading into towns and villages. They are not &s;urrounded with walls, but are, neverthele&s;s, a &s;acred a&s;ylum for fugitives.</P>
<P>We have hitherto &s;poken of their cu&s;toms, as merit|ing our attention from their antiquity; but, with re|&s;pect to their tombs, we may ob&s;erve, that if they are always out of their towns, it is becau&s;e rea&s;on, and the natural order of things, has pointed out this as their proper &s;ituation, that the abode of the living might be di&s;tingui&s;hed from that of the dead. In Greece, the temple where the Eternal is adored, will never be found &s;ullied, as with us, by the infection of dead bodies. The incen&s;e burnt in our churches, &s;eems more properly applied to di&s;&s;ipate the pe&s;tiferous ex|halations,

which ari&s;e from putrefactions, than to the holy purpo&s;es of divine &s;ervice. If &s;ome great men, as a token of peculiar benefits conferred by them upon mankind, have anciently received the honour of in|terment in cities; if the emperor <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> from a motive of piety, directed his body to remain after death, in the church of the holy apo&s;tles, which he him&s;elf founded; if, &s;ince that time, the &s;ame di&s;|tinction has been granted to a few bi&s;hops, and other per&s;ons of exemplary life; if, indeed, the emperor <HI>Leo,</HI> granted permi&s;&s;ion to bury in churches; the prac|tice has been &s;o much abu&s;ed in &s;ucceeding ages, that the continuance has been forbidden by &s;everal of the ge|neral &s;ynods or councils. Not merely to maintain the dignity of the church, but to guard the lives and health of its faithful children. This practice is now, however, pur&s;ued to a &s;hameful exce&s;s, in Catholic, as well as Prote&s;tant countries. The ancient Greeks mo&s;t &s;crupulou&s;ly ob&s;erved this wi&s;e law, which pro|hibited interment in their temples; or even within the walls of their cities. The marble, the ornaments, and the epitaphs on the tombs, di&s;tingui&s;h the rank and oc|cupation of the decea&s;ed. On the tomb of a &s;culptor, will be found a chi&s;&s;el; arms on that of a &s;oldier; and &s;o of the re&s;t. This cu&s;tom is of long &s;tanding among the Greeks.</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="334"><HI>"Meni&s;kus,"</HI> &s;ays <HI>Sappho,</HI> "decorated the tomb of <HI>Pelagus</HI> his &s;on, who was a fi&s;herman, with an oar and a net; in&s;truments expre&s;&s;ive of his dangerous and laborious calling."</P>
<P>Thus, the gho&s;t of <HI>Elpenor</HI> &s;ays to <HI>Uly&s;&s;es;</HI> "Erect a tomb to my memory, near the &s;ea, that my di&s;a&s;trous fate may be made known to the traveller.

<P><HI>Archimedes,</HI> according to <HI>Plutarch,</HI> de&s;ired his re|lations to put no ornament on his tomb, but a cylinder and a &s;phere, which were to &s;erve him likewi&s;e for an epitaph.</P>
<P>The modern Greeks &s;till pre&s;erve that &s;implicity in their epitaphs, which was &s;o characteri&s;tic of the ancient ones.</P>
<P>The Indian philo&s;opher, who threw him&s;elf into the flames at Athens, in the pre&s;ence of <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> and to the great a&s;toni&s;hment of the Greeks, had no other epitaph on his tomb, than this &s;imple in&s;cription:</P>
<P>"Here are depo&s;ited, the a&s;hes of <HI>Zarmano Choegas,</HI> an Indian of Bargo&s;a; who, according to the cu&s;tom of his country, encountered a voluntary death."</P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="335">Mo&s;t of the ancient in&s;criptions &s;hew what re&s;pect the Greeks entertained for the a&s;hes of the dead, and the tombs that enclo&s;ed them; we find an example of this at Thyatira; atte&s;ted by <HI>Smith, Spon, Wheeler,</HI> and <HI>Pey&s;onnell.</HI></P>
<P><HI>"Fabius Sozimus,</HI> cau&s;ed this tomb to be erected near the con&s;ecrated olive-tree, which &s;tands in the Chaldocian field, by the &s;ide of the great road, at the entrance of the city, for the reception of him&s;elf and his dear wife <HI>Aureliana Pontiana,</HI> and for them alone. Should any impious per&s;on dare to violate this foun|dation, he will not only incur a fine of thirteen hun|dred denarii of &s;ilver, but &s;uffer the puni&s;hment a&s;|&s;igned by the laws, to tho&s;e &s;acrilegious felons, who di&s;turb the a&s;hes of the dead, to rob their tombs."</P>
<P>This &s;pecies of robbery, was formerly very com|mon. In the time of S. <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tom,</HI> the pri&s;ons were filled with malefactors, committed for that offence. The ancient Greeks forbad the interment of many per&s;ons in one tomb; except they were of the &s;ame family. The epitaphs which &s;till remain, inform us, that penalties were affixed in ca&s;es of di&s;obedience.</P>
<P>Though the magnificence of tombs is produced, in many in&s;tances, from the cultivation of vanity and riches; we &s;hall find them oftener the recompen&s;e
<PB N="330" REF="336">
due to valour and merit; and in particular to tho&s;e heroes, who have &s;ignalized them&s;elves in the &s;ervice of their country. <HI>Cyrus,</HI> bewailing the fall of <HI>Abra|datus,</HI> to <HI>Panthea,</HI> promi&s;es, in order to con&s;ole him, that he would erect a &s;uperb monument to the me|mory of their decea&s;ed friend.</P>
<P>Who can read, without emotion, the following in|&s;cription, upon an ancient tomb at Thebes?</P>
<P>"My father and mother honoured my corp&s;e with their tears, performing, around my in&s;en&s;ible tomb, the cu&s;tomary funeral rites; but, my &s;oul is gone to the man&s;ions of the ju&s;t. My father was an Italian by birth, named <HI>Adeus;</HI> my own name <HI>Nedymus;</HI> and, without vanity it may be &s;aid, I died regretted of many. I lived only a few years, being born to enjoy but a &s;hort life, by the cruelty of an incon&s;tant age. We mu&s;t all &s;ubmit to fate. Kings them&s;elves are not exempt from its laws. My father <HI>Zo&s;imus,</HI> who &s;ighs ince&s;&s;antly after my immortal &s;oul, cau&s;ed this epitaph to be in&s;cribed on my tomb."</P>
<P>The ancient epitaphs, frequently contained a &s;hort de&s;cription of the per&s;onal beauties of the decea&s;ed. An in&s;tance of which, may be &s;till &s;een at Athens, on the tomb of a young woman, called <HI>Cilitia Charitopis,</HI> who died in the flower of her life. "Her hair was of
<PB N="331" REF="337">
a light colour, her eyes &s;oft and langui&s;hing, her com|plexion of &s;now, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Exclu&s;ive of the&s;e tombs, they have &s;mall grave-&s;tones; which anciently, as at pre&s;ent, &s;erved merely to acquaint the reader with the name of the per&s;on buried there.</P>
<P>"At Athens, &s;ays <HI>Pau&s;anias,</HI> tho&s;e brave citizens, who fell in the &s;ervice of their country, were interred by the &s;ide of the road that leads to the academy. Their tombs are known by pillars &s;et up for that pur|po&s;e; whereon are marked, the names of the decea&s;ed, and the places of their nativity."</P>
<P>Can we turn our eyes towards tho&s;e immen&s;e plains, once covered with flouri&s;hing cities; the &s;eat of arts, the glory of the univer&s;e; but now &s;trewed with the ruins of temples, and the dreary monuments, inclo&s;ing the remains of that great people; can we, I &s;ay, be|hold them without &s;hedding a tear of regret, at the in|&s;tability of human grandeur?</P>
<P>Life is held by the mo&s;t brittle tenure; youth, full of liberty and di&s;&s;ipation, mi&s;pends the pre&s;ent hour, regardle&s;s of the future. Man arrives at maturity of judgment, but by &s;low degrees; and then the remain|ing part of life is too &s;hort, to make an advantageous
<PB N="332" REF="338">
u&s;e of the acqui&s;ition. The in&s;tant he comes to the perfection of his rea&s;on, his powers decline. For nature is always in motion, &s;he mu&s;t either advance or recede. In this po&s;ition, all things are involved. Every being bears in its progre&s;s, the cau&s;e of its de|&s;truction. The fruits of the earth, having gained a a perfect maturity, begin to corrupt. The mo&s;t &s;toical in&s;en&s;ibility would be moved, at the &s;ight of the devouring havock death has made in this country.</P>
<P>The tribute of a tear, to the remembrance of our departed friends, is ju&s;tly their due. Faithful to this principle, the Greeks deplore, from time to time, the lo&s;s of tho&s;e who have been dear to them in life; either by an affectionate &s;ight, or a tender tear, vented on the tomb of the decea&s;ed. How different from the formal ceremony, ob&s;erved by us, on &s;uch occa|&s;ions; and that, by the injunction of our religion? But what &s;urprize is there in our being &s;o much e&s;|tranged from nature; we, who reject with indig|nation, as gro&s;s and indelicate, every circum&s;tance ca|pable of exciting our natural &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>During the time that the Greeks celebrate the fe&s;|tival of Ea&s;ter, which is attended with great &s;plendor, one day of that &s;ea&s;on, is al&s;o &s;et apart, for a vi&s;it to the tombs; when they re&s;ort in great numbers, to bewail the lo&s;s of their friends and relations.</P>
<P><PB N="333" REF="339">The Greek women of the pre&s;ent age, are &s;atisfied with tearing &s;ome hair from their head and &s;preading it on the tomb. Formerly, their long and beautiful tre&s;&s;es, were always a devoted victim to their relations and friends. That beautiful ornament, the hair, of which the &s;ex were &s;o tenacious on all other occa&s;ions, was offered without reluctance at the tomb. They cut it off clo&s;e to the head, and depo&s;ited it upon the monument.</P>
<P>"Here lie," &s;ays <HI>Sappho,</HI> "the a&s;hes of the lovely <HI>Timas;</HI> who was &s;natched from the altar of <HI>Hymen,</HI> to inhabit the gloomy regions of <HI>Pro&s;erpine.</HI> Her companions lamented her death, with the u&s;ual de|mon&s;trations of &s;orrow. The fine &s;acrifice of beau|tiful hair, &s;cattered about her monument, are precious tokens of their grief."</P>
<P>A &s;acrifice of this kind, con&s;idering the e&s;timation in which the fine flowing tre&s;&s;es of hair were held by the Greeks, was no equivocal mark of tenderne&s;s and grief. O! charming pro&s;pect! &s;ays <HI>Guys,</HI> how many precious moments have I pa&s;&s;ed, in contem|plating the tombs of Greece! Yes, my imagination has hovered over their whole extent, like tho&s;e me|lancholy birds, that take &s;o much delight in fluttering round them.</P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="340">Yet do not imagine this view of mortality, among the &s;cattered tombs, is altogether di&s;mal and forlorn. The &s;pecies of horror, &s;uch a &s;pectacle impre&s;&s;es on an hone&s;t and gentle mind, is greatly alleviated by the variety of &s;urrounding objects. Curio&s;ity, and hu|manity, find a &s;weet &s;atisfaction from the in&s;cription; which give, as it were, language to the tombs; and where, too often, unfortunate mortals receive the fir&s;t recompence of their virtues from &s;ociety. Envy being &s;ilenced, the veil is then removed that kept merit and ju&s;tice a&s;under. How much is it to be regretted, that artifice, lying, and hatred, &s;hould poi&s;on &s;o many of the &s;prings of life! On the tomb only, can we expect our virtues to be blazoned; and even then, we mu&s;t &s;tand indebted to the piety of our relations, or the fidelity of our friends, for this act of ju&s;tice. An agreeable walk, is generally the avenue to the&s;e monuments; where our principal dwelling-place is already marked out. This &s;cene, in &s;ome degree, unites us again to our friends; from whom, fate &s;eemed to have for ever &s;eparated us. And, indeed, never fails to furni&s;h very u&s;eful reflexions.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XLII.</HI> Of the Religion and Super&s;tition of the Greeks.</HEAD>
<P>THE whole Greek church, including every &s;ect, is of con&s;iderable extent, containing not only the chri&s;tians of the Turki&s;h empire, who, in many parts, are more numerous than the Mahometans; but al&s;o the Mu&s;covites, Ru&s;&s;ians, Co&s;&s;acs, Ethiopians, Aby&s;&s;inians, Circa&s;&s;ians, Georgians, Mongrelians, and the inhabitants of the different i&s;lands in the Mediter|ranean and Archipelago. We &s;hall here treat of tho&s;e under the Turki&s;h dominion, who are governed by four patriarchs; the chief of which re&s;ides at Con&s;tan|tinople; the &s;econd at Antioch; the third at Jeru|&s;alem; and the fourth at Alexandria. Though the&s;e four &s;ees are independent of each other, that of Con|&s;tantinople is con&s;idered as the principal, becau&s;e it is under the eyes of the Ottoman court.</P>
<P>The inve&s;titure of it is generally given by the grand &s;ignior, or his vizier; notwith&s;tanding this, the Greeks acknowledge it. This dignity, as we have already
<PB N="336" REF="342">
ob&s;erved, in our account of Turkey, is &s;old to the highe&s;t bidder; and, after having obtained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, he is not &s;ure of retaining it long, if he cannot find means of furni&s;hing con&s;iderable pre&s;ents to the Turki&s;h government. To be able to accompli&s;h this, he draws as much money as he po&s;&s;ibly can, from the clergy, and people belonging to his juri&s;diction; He, likewi&s;e, endeavours to &s;ave enough to enable him, if di&s;graced, to lead a life of ea&s;e, indolence, and tranquility.</P>
<P>His juri&s;diction is very great, and extends, not only over all the Turki&s;h provinces in Europe, and the i&s;lands of the Archipelago, but likewi&s;e over mo&s;t of the provinces in A&s;ia Minor. In his letters mi&s;&s;ive, he &s;tiles him&s;elf, by the mercy of God, archbi&s;hop of New Rome, Con&s;tantinople, and Oecumenical pa|triarch.</P>
<P>The patriarch of Antioch, has Syria, and Me&s;opo|tamia, under his juri&s;diction; and &s;tiles him&s;elf, by the mercy of God, patriarch of the great city of Antioch, and of all the Ea&s;t. His u&s;ual re&s;idence is Da|ma&s;cus.</P>
<P>The patriarch of Jeru&s;alem, has Pale&s;tine, and part of Arabia, under his juri&s;diction; and &s;tiles him&s;elf a before, and patriarch of the holy city of Jeru&s;alem,
<PB N="337" REF="343">
and all Pale&s;tine; &s;ometimes he is &s;tiled patriarch of Jeru&s;alem, the holy Mount of Sion, Syria, Arabia beyond Jordan, Cana of Gallilee, and of all Pa|le&s;tine.</P>
<P>The patriarch of Alexandria, who&s;e juri&s;diction ex|tends over Egypt, Lybia, and part of Egypt, &s;tiles him&s;elf, by the mercy of God, pope and patriarch of the great city of Alexandria, and Oecumenical judge, &s;ometimes Oecumenical patriarch; it having been the chief &s;ee before <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> and founded by St. <HI>Mark;</HI> from whence, Alexandria is frequently called the throne, or &s;eat and chair of that apo&s;tle. His u&s;ual re&s;idence is Grand Cairo.</P>
<P>The&s;e three patriarchs are appointed by the Ba|&s;haws. The other &s;ects of chri&s;tians, have al&s;o their patriarchs; &s;uch as the Armenians, Maronites, Jaco|bins, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The &s;econd rank in the hierarchy is occupied by the arch-bi&s;hops and bi&s;hops, under the in&s;pection of their re&s;pective patriarchs. Though carele&s;s re&s;pect|ing religion, and di&s;&s;olute in their private life, &s;ays <HI>Mariti,</HI> the&s;e prelates require, that tho&s;e who either write or &s;peak to them, &s;hould addre&s;s them with the title of your holine&s;s, and your ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. The fir&s;t belongs to patriarchs, and the &s;econd to bi&s;hops. To
<PB N="338" REF="344">
add a lu&s;tre to their office, their menial &s;ervants are generally in deacon's orders.</P>
<P>They cannot be reproached, however, with neg|lecting their dioce&s;es. They begin their vi&s;itation every twelfth-day, and do not di&s;dain to enter even the poore&s;t cottages. How noble the&s;e vi&s;its would be, did they not proceed from intere&s;ted motives! The pontiff, in the name of Heaven, draws from the unhappy pea&s;ant, all his money; and leaves him nothing but a u&s;ele&s;s benediction. For this rea&s;on, while the re&s;t of Europe complain they never &s;ee their bi&s;hops, the inhabitants in Turkey lament they &s;ee them too often.</P>
<P>The religious orders of S. <HI>Ba&s;il,</HI> S. <HI>Elias,</HI> and S. <HI>Marcel,</HI> have, from time immemorial, enjoyed the ex|clu&s;ive privilege of furni&s;hing bi&s;hops and patriarchs. The&s;e monks make the &s;ame vows of poverty, fa&s;ting, obedience, and cha&s;tity, as tho&s;e of Europe. They are forbidden by their regulations, to &s;ay ma&s;s; but, in order to become pontiffs, they forget this prohibi|tion. And I could ea&s;ily &s;ee, adds <HI>Mariti,</HI> they paid as little attention to their other vows.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t, however, do them ju&s;tice to &s;ay, that their whole lives are not &s;pent in contemplative idlene&s;s.
<PB N="339" REF="345">
They cultivate their own lands, and exerci&s;e u&s;eful callings.</P>
<P>Confined to the mo&s;t rigorous fa&s;ting, they live on pul&s;e; and never eat fi&s;h, but on days of great &s;olem|nity. One may readily gue&s;s, that this au&s;tere life is not followed by their chiefs.</P>
<P>The latter are known by the title of <HI>igumenos,</HI> which an&s;wers to that of Abb&eacute;.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t order among the Greeks, conferred upon tho&s;e who devote them&s;elves to the &s;ervice of the church, is that of reader, called <HI>anagno&s;tis;</HI> the only duty of which is, to read the &s;acred &s;criptures to the people, on fe&s;tivals.</P>
<P>The next order is, that of the <HI>p&s;altis,</HI> or chanters; which conducts immediately to the deacon&s;hip, and &s;ub-deacon&s;hip.</P>
<P>When a per&s;on is admitted into this &s;econd order, he is permitted to marry, but only once. The can|didate mu&s;t chu&s;e for his &s;pou&s;e a cha&s;te and beau|tiful virgin; and the rea&s;on the Greek canons give for this, is, that a mini&s;ter who corre&s;ponds with angels, ought not to profane his fle&s;h with vice and ugline&s;s. The candidate has not the &s;ole right to
<PB N="340" REF="346">
judge of the&s;e three points; he is obliged to conduct his young &s;weetheart to the bi&s;hop of the dioce&s;e, and a&s;k him in a humble manner, if &s;he appears to be cha&s;te, beautiful, and a virgin. When the prelate really thinks her &s;o, he &s;miles, ki&s;&s;es her cheek, and gives her his be|nediction. On the contrary, when he finds her di&s;agree|able, his ble&s;&s;edne&s;s &s;ays to the candidate, "Return to the Holy Gho&s;t; and by that it may enlighten thee."</P>
<P>A married prie&s;t, is forbidden to enter the bed of his &s;pou&s;e, the evening before he admini&s;ters the &s;a|crament; and the wife is forbidden to appear in church without a veil, left the &s;ight of her charms &s;hould divert the attention of her hu&s;band from his duty.</P>
<P>The breviary of the Greeks is divided into &s;even parts; and the daily prayers would take up &s;ome &s;everal hours, were the whole recited, which is &s;carce ever done.</P>
<P>The churches are, as in Europe, divided into a nave and a choir. Old churches have a porch and a ve&s;|tibule.</P>
<P>The church is &s;urrounded with &s;everal rows of benches, as far as the entrance of the choir. The&s;e
<PB N="341" REF="347">
benches are pretty much like tho&s;e in our churches; except that they are higher and narrower, and have no footboard, becau&s;e the Greeks never kneel. They make devotion to con&s;i&s;t in frequent &s;alutations, and inflections of the body. Few &s;it down; as they prefer remaining, with their elbows leaning on the arms of their benches.</P>
<P>Cu&s;tom has e&s;tabli&s;hed it as a rule, that the women &s;hould be &s;eparated from the men. A barrier, in the form of an orche&s;tra, is rai&s;ed in the lower part of the church; behind which, the former are placed; and there are certain days in each month, on which they mu&s;t not even pa&s;s the ve&s;tibule, or the fir&s;t door of tho&s;e churches, which have not a portico. They are forbidden likewi&s;e, on the&s;e days, to ki&s;s the images of the &s;aints.</P>
<P>The manner in which the Greeks make the &s;ign of the cro&s;s, is not different from that of the Roman Ca|tholics; except that they unite the thumb, and the middle fingers, in the form of a triangle, pre&s;&s;ing the other two down to the palm of the hand.</P>
<P>Bapti&s;m is performed by immer&s;ion; and children are plunged three times into the water: it is cu&s;to|mary to pre&s;ent them for bapti&s;m, the eighth day after their birth.</P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="348">After bapti&s;m, the prie&s;t anoints the child's fore|head, eyes, no&s;trils, mouth, ears, brea&s;t, hands, and feet, with holy unction, and immediately after gives it the &s;acrament.</P>
<P>Auricular confe&s;&s;ion is practi&s;ed among the Greeks, and is become an object of great profit to the prie&s;ts; as people do not receive ab&s;olution, unle&s;s they pay a certain &s;um, in proportion to the enormity of their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions. Should fate have condemned a per|&s;on to ab&s;olute indigence, &s;ays <HI>Mariti,</HI> he can find no mini&s;ter who will conde&s;cend to hear him. What then mu&s;t tho&s;e do, who, thinking confe&s;&s;ion nece&s;&s;ary, po&s;&s;e&s;s no money? Pro&s;trated on the &s;teps of the church, they mu&s;t beg the rich to give them a &s;mall alms, and thereby enable them to be delivered from their &s;ins, and &s;ave their &s;ouls.</P>
<P>It is amu&s;ing to hear the Greek ca&s;ui&s;ts. The fol|lowing is a ca&s;e of con&s;cience; the &s;olution of which may appear very &s;ingular. If a penitent accu&s;es him|&s;elf of having committed a theft, the confe&s;&s;or a&s;ks him, whether the per&s;on robbed, is a Greek or an European. In the fir&s;t ca&s;e he is ab&s;olved, upon making re&s;titution; but in the &s;econd, he is con&s;idered as not having finned, by dividing the produce of the robbery with the confe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="349">The &s;acrament co&s;ts a pia&s;tre, and holy unction the &s;ame. To procure a ready &s;ale for the latter, the prie&s;ts per&s;uade the people, that the con&s;ecrated oil confers both health of body, and purity of &s;oul.</P>
<P>Such of the a&s;&s;i&s;tants as wi&s;h to communicate, go and place them&s;elves before the principal door of the &s;anctuary; and the prie&s;t, laying the book of the ritual upon the head of each communicant, pre&s;ents them in their turn with the con&s;ecrated bread and wine.</P>
<P>There are reckoned to be four principal Lents in the Greek church, in the cour&s;e of the year. The fir&s;t precedes Ea&s;ter, and continues two months. Milk and fi&s;h are allowed in the fir&s;t week, but for|bidden in the other &s;even. Certain kinds of fi&s;h, &s;uch as oy&s;ters, and &s;ome other &s;hell-fi&s;h, are excepted from this prohibition. The law, which forbids fi&s;h only, becau&s;e they contain blood, con&s;idering the&s;e as not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd Lent, which is forty days before the nativity of Chri&s;t, fi&s;h of every kind is allowed.</P>
<P>The third Lent begins on Whit-Monday, and ends on St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s day. It was in&s;tituted in memory of the apo&s;tles; and its duration depends on the advance|ment,
<PB N="344" REF="350">
or retardation of Ea&s;ter. During this Lent, milk is permitted.</P>
<P>The la&s;t is &s;olely intended in honour of the <HI>Vir|gin Mary.</HI> It begins on the fir&s;t day of Augu&s;t, and ends on the day of a&s;&s;umption. This Lent is ob|&s;erved with more &s;trictne&s;s, than any of the re&s;t, on account of the great re&s;pect entertained for the mother of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Old men, children, women with child, and even the &s;ick, are not exempted from ob&s;erving the&s;e four Lents; and &s;o great is the &s;uper&s;tition of the Greeks, that they think it le&s;s heinous to rob, pro&s;titute them|&s;elves publicly, or even to commit murder, than to tran&s;gre&s;s their precepts for fa&s;ting.</P>
<P>The modern Greeks hold &s;even &s;acraments. Bap|ti&s;m, unction, the euchari&s;t, penance, holy orders, marriage, and prayer.</P>
<P>The laity are enjoined to receive the communion four times every year; and this is never omitted, at lea&s;t twice a year; namely, at Chri&s;tmas and Ea&s;ter. It is received fa&s;ting, at the third hour of the day, or about nine in the morning. The communicants take it &s;tanding, and bending at the &s;ame time, their bodies, but they never kneel. That tho&s;e who are &s;ick or
<PB N="345" REF="351">
dying, may not want this comfortable viaticum; a &s;uf|ficient quantity of bread is con&s;ecrated on Holy Thur&s;|day; which being dried over a chafing di&s;h, is put into a box of &s;ilver, or wood; and, being inclo&s;ed in a &s;ilk ca&s;e, is hung up behind the altar, with a lamp or two burning before it. If the prie&s;ts have occa&s;ion to make u&s;e of it, they moi&s;ten it with wine, before they carry it to the hou&s;e of the &s;ick communicant.</P>
<P>Every per&s;on is obliged to confe&s;s four times a year, except the poor; of whom it is required, only once in Lent. From very devout people, a monthly confe&s;&s;ion is expected. If a per&s;on dies before he has received ab&s;olution, he is con&s;idered to be in a de&s;perate &s;tate; but &s;hould he die excommunicated, his corp&s;e is &s;up|po&s;ed to feel the di&s;mal effects of it in the grave; and that it will grow hard, and &s;well like a drum, while the &s;entence of excommunication is in force; this, the Greeks &s;ay, is occa&s;ioned by the devils entering into it. The bi&s;hops, when they prohibit any thing in their briefs, particularly threaten the offenders, that after death they &s;hall &s;well, and be undi&s;&s;olved; but, when the excommunication is taken off, then the body will di&s;&s;olve and return to du&s;t.</P>
<P>The ceremony of anointing the &s;ick with oil, is another of their &s;acraments, and &s;imilar to that of ex|treme unction with the Roman Catholics.</P>
<P><PB N="346" REF="352">How &s;hall I de&s;cribe to you, &s;ays <HI>Guys,</HI> the religion of this people? It has, no doubt, experienced the &s;ame revolutions with the Greek empire. Like every thing el&s;e in this nation, we find it ob&s;cured with the darke&s;t ignorance, and the gro&s;&s;e&s;t &s;uper&s;tition. The Greek religion has retained no part of its original in|&s;titution; except the ceremonies, ornaments, and &s;olem|nities, &s;erving as &s;igns by which it may be known.</P>
<P>The religion of a people, conducted by the mo&s;t il|literate prie&s;ts, who &s;carcely know how to read, at be&s;t, can only be expected to pre&s;erve the exterior form and likene&s;s, of what it originally was. Thus, the glorious light which once &s;hone upon this people, and di&s;&s;ipated the darkne&s;s of pagani&s;m, and its ab&s;urd tenets, is dwindled into a glimmering re&s;emblance of its former &s;plendor.</P>
<P>The ignorance of the clergy, nece&s;&s;arily includes that of the nation. The gaudy trappings of their prie&s;ts; the fe&s;tivals and ceremonies, with a few or|naments for the mona&s;teries and altars, are all that re|main to the poor captured Greeks; the Turks, indeed, have continued the u&s;e of their churches; and beyond the&s;e they have no religion. This nation, the parent of Polythei&s;m, fraught with the pagan principles of the ancient Greeks, continued even in the fir&s;t ages of chri&s;tianity, to multiply the objects of devotion;
<PB N="347" REF="353">
though they had the happine&s;s of knowing the true God. Abandoned formerly, to the opinions and errors of their philo&s;ophers, they had found in the go&s;pel, and in chri&s;tian morality, what philo&s;ophy had in vain attempted to unfold. Human curio&s;ity, ill &s;atisfied with the lights of faith, which would &s;ubdue rea&s;on, and the pride of mortal judgment, endeavoured to a&s;|&s;imilate with chri&s;tianity, the ancient doctrine of the two principles of a good and evil genius; errors to which the Greeks had been invariably attached. From hence, innumerable here&s;ies, and a multitude of &s;ects, have been engendered in the bo&s;om of the Greek church; which &s;till continues to be the nur&s;e of error and fal&s;hood.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of the emperors, who, from the time of <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> until the &s;eparation between the Greek and Latin churches, were oftener engaged in theolo|gical di&s;putes, than in managing the political concerns of the empire, may be more properly called, the hi&s;|tory of commotions and civil wars, on account of re|ligion. At length, the Greek clergy, educated in the principles of eternal controver&s;y, were &s;ilenced by the la&s;t conqueror of Greece. <HI>Mahomet</HI> II. contented him&s;elf with naming a patriarch, and graciou&s;ly left the free exerci&s;e of their religion to this poor, un|done, &s;ubdued people; which put an end to tho&s;e di&s;|putes, &s;o repugnant to the military fanatici&s;m of the
<PB N="348" REF="354">
Turks; for <HI>Mahomet,</HI> the prophet, an ab&s;olute de&s;pot, who pretended to be in&s;pired, having e&s;tabli&s;hed his religion by force of arms, ordered every one to be|lieve, and would have no arguments.</P>
<P>Under &s;uch ma&s;ters, how could the Monks, and Greek prie&s;ts, ever trembling, and having no longer opportunities to exerci&s;e them&s;elves in di&s;putation, cultivate theology and letters. We may from thence conclude, that the modern Greeks having no fit pa&s;|tors to guide them in their religion, have added to that which they profe&s;s, all the traditions and prac|tices which credulity and cu&s;tom could pre&s;erve; and, by their attachment to ancient u&s;ages, have re|tained innumerable &s;uper&s;titions. In a word, the&s;e people are credulous in proportion to their ignorance: thus we find them, exce&s;&s;ively attached to prodigies, auguries, omens, and dreams; as they are al&s;o con|&s;tant ob&s;ervers of fa&s;ts, and other cu&s;toms derived from their ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>The Greek religion is now become that of the Ru&s;&s;ian. The latter, towards the end of the tenth century, received a metropolitan into their kingdom, who was &s;ent by the patriarch of Con&s;tantinople, to baptize and in&s;truct them. In proce&s;s of time, that patriarch became &s;upreme of the Ru&s;&s;ian church; but in the year 1667, the Ru&s;&s;ians &s;hook off their de|pendance
<PB N="349" REF="355">
on the Greek hierarchy; without intro|ducing the lea&s;t innovation in its doctrine. Thus, the Greeks and Ru&s;&s;ians profe&s;s the &s;ame religion; and the prie&s;ts of both nations are habited alike; but the&s;e are the only particulars they hold in common with each other.</P>
<P>Au&s;tere and frequent fa&s;ts, the cu&s;toms of public prayer, and of a&s;&s;embling in church before &s;un-ri&s;e; the dread of being excommunicated, and of an exclu|&s;ion from the a&s;&s;embly of the faithful; in &s;hort, the greate&s;t re&s;pect for their patriarch and the bi&s;hops, are u&s;ages which the Greeks have retained from the pri|mitive Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>But to go &s;till further back, we mu&s;t examine the re|ligious fe&s;tivals, which they celebrate in the country villages; they will call to mind the bacchanals, and the devotion of the ancients, for a &s;acred fountain, or an ancient fore&s;t; which were, with them, objects of veneration and wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>The Greeks have &s;till their venerable caverns, and their con&s;ecrated waters. They go in crouds, on cer|tain days of the year, and drink of them; and the&s;e days have the honour of being numbered among their religious fe&s;tivals. The borders of the&s;e fountains are ornamented with little pieces of linen or &s;tuff, as trophies of the virtues of the &s;pring, in having re&s;tored
<PB N="350" REF="356">
&s;o many to health. They ob&s;erve the &s;ame method of returning thanks to the &s;aint they chanced to invoke, in any calamity or di&s;order; and, if the event proves propitious, an offering is made of a bit of &s;tuff, or &s;ome little trinket, affixed to the images. The cre|dulity of the ancient Greeks, and of the heathens in general, with re&s;pect to all &s;orts of pre&s;ages, is well known. The oracles, tho&s;e lying in&s;truments, were not &s;ufficient for their purpo&s;e. They had recour&s;e to fate, to divination, and to fortuitous expre&s;&s;ions; to all of which they yielded the mo&s;t implicit faith. The Greeks &s;till draw pre&s;ages from a thou&s;and in|cidents, which happen accidentally. Thus, a taper or candle, which chances to emit a &s;park, announces the arrival of &s;ome per&s;on they expected.</P>
<P>Chance expre&s;&s;ions, and particularly tho&s;e of in|fants, had the force of an oracle with the ancients. The epigram of <HI>Callimachus,</HI> on this &s;ubject, is much admired. "A &s;tranger, &s;ays he, con&s;ulted the &s;age <HI>Pittacus,</HI> of Mitylene; which, of two young women who were offered him in marriage, he &s;hould take for a wife. The e&s;tate and rank of the fir&s;t, were &s;uitable to his own; but the other was much his &s;uperior in both. <HI>Pittacus,</HI> in&s;tead of an&s;wering the que&s;tion him|&s;elf, pointed out with a &s;tick, to &s;ome children who were whipping their tops in the public &s;quare, and bid him take his an&s;wer from them, which would clear up
<PB N="351" REF="357">
his doubts." The &s;tranger approaching, hears them call out to each other&mdash;take your equal.&mdash;The&s;e words were &s;ufficient, he &s;ought no other oracle, but took the woman, who&s;e circum&s;tances a&s;&s;imilated the neare&s;t to his own, and was happy.&mdash;Profit by the ex|ample, &s;ays the poet, and marry with your equal. This tract, which paints in &s;uch &s;trong colours, the &s;weetne&s;s and &s;implicity of the ancients, is really in|tere&s;ting.</P>
<P>The Greeks have al&s;o their good and evil days. The fortieth day is &s;acred to lying-in women; who never go out before the expiration of that term. An|ciently, it was celebrated by them as a fe&s;tival; and, before the arrival of this period, the women were not allowed to enter into the temple; and even now, a certain time mu&s;t elap&s;e before they are admitted into it.</P>
<P>Their attachment to &s;uper&s;titious and vulgar pre|judices is not weakened, we may be certain, by long cu&s;tom. Few nations have any good rea&s;ons to offer in ju&s;tification of their particular habits; precedent and u&s;age is the only an&s;wer they have to give. A detail of all the &s;uper&s;titious practices of the Greeks, would be enormou&s;ly voluminous, and con&s;equently tire&s;ome. We &s;hall mention tho&s;e only, which are their pre&s;ent characteri&s;tics.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="358">The ancient &s;uper&s;titions are de&s;cribed by <HI>Theo|phra&s;tus;</HI> the modern Greeks have rather augmented, than dimini&s;hed their number.</P>
<P>S. <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tom</HI> relates the bigotry of his own times, which &s;till remains to the pre&s;ent age. "Nothing can equal, &s;ays this author, the women in the&s;e parti|culars, with re&s;pect to their young children. The in&s;tant one is brought into the world, all the lamps of the hou&s;e are lighted; and the infant is called by the name of &s;ome per&s;on who has lived to a great age, to procure long life for it. They tie threads of &s;carlet about their hands, to pre&s;erve them from accidents. The women-nur&s;es, and &s;ometimes the &s;laves, go and put their fingers into a kind of clay, which is found at the bottom of the baths; with which they mark the forehead of the child, in order to avert from it the evil &s;ight, or envy. Some write on the hands of the child, the names of rivers and &s;treams; while others make u&s;e of a&s;hes, tallow, and &s;alt, for the like pur|po&s;e." All this is done to avert the evil &s;ight which they dread to this day.</P>
<P>A quick imagination, ea&s;ily inflamed and nur&s;ed in a &s;y&s;tem of vulgar errors and fables, that exaggerate every thing, cannot but be &s;u&s;ceptible of the &s;lighte&s;t impre&s;&s;ions. "Accordingly, adds the &s;ame reverend father, their &s;ouls are always occupied by the mo&s;t
<PB N="353" REF="359">
terrible apprehen&s;ions. Going out this morning, &s;ays one, &s;uch an accident happened which portends the mo&s;t grievous misfortunes. My rogue of a valet, &s;ays another, on pre&s;enting me my &s;hoes, gave me that for the left foot fir&s;t, a &s;ure &s;ign I &s;hall &s;u&s;tain a lo&s;s, or an affront. A third informs you, that he came out with the left leg foremo&s;t, an infallible token of mi&s;chief."</P>
<P>The modern Greeks, are &s;ubject to the &s;ame weak|ne&s;&s;es, the &s;ame fears, the &s;ame credulity. In &s;tudy|ing a nation, in following the people &s;tep by &s;tep, we find in all climates, that they exactly re&s;emble tho&s;e who went before them. What we &s;ay of individuals, is true of whole nations.</P>
<P>Nothing more &s;trongly characterizes the credulity of a people, than the faith they place in dreams, and their manner of interpreting them. <HI>Pliny</HI>'s a&s;toni&s;h|ment, at the credulity of the Greeks, was very natural. Religion has de&s;troyed the famous oracles of Greece; but rea&s;on has not done her part, in a&s;&s;i&s;ting to di|mini&s;h the credit given by the Greeks to dreams. An|cient authors, of the greate&s;t reputation, have treated them in the mo&s;t &s;erious manner; while the lively imagination of the poets, who, like lovers, are the creators of their own fancies, have not given them &s;uch a favourable reception in their minds. If &s;ome
<PB N="354" REF="360">
of the great writers of antiquity have joined in a be|lief of the efficacy of dreams; others, of no le&s;s autho|rity, have rejected them, as delu&s;ive imaginations of the brain, &s;ignifying nothing.</P>
<P><HI>Plutarch,</HI> as a&s;&s;iduous in relating the dreams, as the <HI>bon mots</HI> of the great men, who&s;e lives he writ, &s;ays, that <HI>Sylla,</HI> in his writings, a&s;&s;erts, nothing was more certain than the intelligence given to mankind in their dreams.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> in con&s;equence of a particular dream im|po&s;ed upon him&s;elf, the ridiculous and &s;uper&s;titious drudgery, to a&s;&s;ume, on a certain day of the year, the character of a mendicant, holding forth his hand to receive alms from the pa&s;&s;ers by. Whence comes it, &s;o much weakne&s;s &s;hould re&s;ide in a &s;oul of &s;uch &s;u|perior nature?</P>
<P>The famous dream of <HI>Cicero</HI> in his exile, which an|nounced to him a &s;peedy and glorious return, though it was verified in every particular, did not alter the &s;entiments of that great man re&s;pecting dreams. He was of opinion, they were not de&s;erving credit, be|cau&s;e one, among numbers, &s;hould be realized, any more than that a notorious lyar &s;hould be believed who had &s;poken truth.</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="361">The attachment of the ancients, to this &s;pecies of &s;uper&s;tition, was almo&s;t general among the people. A &s;et of gods were e&s;tabli&s;hed, whom they wor&s;hipped under the title of <HI>Dii &s;omniales.</HI> The modern Greeks, have al&s;o certain rules and methods for interpreting dreams; which, no doubt, came to them from the an|cients. There are numbers of old women, who pro|cure the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, in exerci&s;ing this my&s;|tery. I made a point, &s;ays <HI>Guys,</HI> of vi&s;iting &s;ome of the profe&s;&s;ion, in order to be acquainted with their method; a &s;ingle example of which, will be &s;ufficient to elucidate it.</P>
<P>A young Greek, applying to one of the&s;e oracles, &s;aid, "I dreamt a &s;tranger came to me, and pre&s;ented me an aigrette with &s;everal flowers; after lighting a &s;lam|beau, he di&s;appeared." Here is the whole of the my&s;tery, &s;aid the old Sibyl, whom &s;he con&s;ulted. The aigrette, &s;ignifies you &s;hall be married; the lighted flambeau indicates, that the time is near; and the number of flowers, mark the number of children that you will have." Thus &s;pake the oracle. I de&s;ired no more, &s;ays <HI>Guys,</HI> nor did I ever take the trouble to enquire into the verification of his prophecies. In general, the rule is to interpret the dreams upon a contrary footing. The&s;e &s;ini&s;ter accidents indicate good fortune; while the day, which &s;ucceeds a plea|&s;ant
<PB N="356" REF="362">
dream, is a day of &s;orrow to the per&s;on who has dreamt it.</P>
<P>The Greeks, in order to obtain propitious dreams, prepare them&s;elves, as formerly, by fa&s;ts. A young maid, tempted by an ardent and impatient de&s;ire, to know her de&s;tiny by marriage, will not eat of any thing on the evening &s;he propo&s;es to make the e&s;&s;ay, except a piece of dirty cake; which, however, &s;he mu&s;t not accompany with any kind of liquor, left the charm &s;hould be interrupted: &s;he then takes three clews of thread, of different colours; white, red, and black, which &s;he places under her pillow. After this preparatory arrangement, the man who fir&s;t appears to her, and pre&s;ents her &s;omething to drink, is to be her hu&s;band. When &s;he wakes, &s;he is to take one of the threads promi&s;cuou&s;ly from under her pillow. The black, progno&s;ticates her lot to be ca&s;t for a widower; the white, &s;ignifies an old man; but the red, denotes a young and rich hu&s;band, or one according to her wi&s;hes. We &s;hould not engage the attention of our readers with &s;uch puerile relations, but that it is im|po&s;&s;ible to &s;tudy mankind to any advantage, without de&s;cending into their minute ab&s;urdities, as well as cri|tici&s;ing their glaring follies. The pre&s;ent race of men, who arrogantly boa&s;t their &s;uperiority over former times, are they more exempt from &s;uch weakne&s;&s;es, than tho&s;e ages they contemn?</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XLIII.</HI> Commerce and Navigation.</HEAD>
<P>THE Greeks, who received their &s;ciences, arts, fables, and romances from Egypt, imbibed al&s;o, from the Egyptians, their inclination for maritime commerce. In ancient hi&s;tories of Greece, we find the names of very great per&s;onages of antiquity, en|rolled among the &s;ons of commerce. The &s;age <HI>Thales, Plato, Hippocrates,</HI> and the legi&s;lator <HI>Solon,</HI> had all been merchants. <HI>Zeno,</HI> chief of the &s;toics, was the &s;on of a Cyprian merchant. <HI>Sappho</HI> al&s;o, the &s;i&s;ter of <HI>Charaxus,</HI> a dealer in wine. A travelling merchant fir&s;t di&s;covered the value of <HI>Homer</HI>'s poems, and took the pains to collect them. In a word, <HI>He&s;iod</HI> him&s;elf gives le&s;&s;ons to his brother, on the article of com|merce.</P>
<P>The cu&s;tom of merchants, a&s;&s;embling in &s;ome pub|lic place for the purpo&s;es of traffic, is of very ancient date in Greece. This we learn in <HI>Herodotus,</HI> from the an&s;wer of <HI>Cyrus</HI> to the threat of the amba&s;&s;adors from
<PB N="358" REF="364">
Sparta. "I never, &s;ays he, entertain the lea&s;t dread of tho&s;e men, who have a place in this city, where they a&s;&s;emble to deceive each other, by the gro&s;&s;e&s;t per|juries." The&s;e words, &s;ays the &s;ame author, alluded generally to the Greeks. For every city in Greece, had &s;ome place appropriated to the purpo&s;e mentioned by <HI>Cyrus.</HI></P>
<P>What <HI>Cyrus</HI> in&s;inuates, concerning the perjuries of the merchants, refers to the ancient method of making bargains, or contracts. A practice &s;till in u&s;e among the Greeks. As &s;oon as the buyer and &s;eller come to an agreement, the manager, or broker, joins their hands; which is of the &s;ame efficacy with an oath in binding the bargain. In conformity to this practice, we find engraven on the ancient monuments, and par|ticularly on the intaglios, two hands united; which were, no doubt, de&s;igned as the emblem of com|merce.</P>
<P>This cu&s;tom is not confined to the Greeks. We find it prevail in all nations, where any traces remain of the plain dealing and hone&s;ty of the ancients.</P>
<P>The Greeks &s;till entertain a &s;trong propen&s;ity to commerce. The poore&s;t crui&s;e from one i&s;land to another; whil&s;t tho&s;e of more exten&s;ive capitals, en|large the bounds of their commerce to Egypt, and the
<PB N="359" REF="365">
Black &s;ea. Some of the great merchants trade to the Ea&s;t-Indies, by way of Ba&s;&s;ora; and bring from thence callicoes, and &s;tuffs of various kinds. Others hold a corre&s;pondence with Ru&s;&s;ia, for &s;kins, furs, &amp;c. The Greeks, like the Ragu&s;ans, having no inclination for extravagance, live at a very &s;mall expence, as the mo&s;t certain means of gain. Tho&s;e who cannot find an en|couragement at home, &s;eek an e&s;tabli&s;hment in Hol|land or Venice.</P>
<P>They are not only good merchants, but excellent ar|tificers. They have e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;everal manufactories at Scio; where &s;tuffs are made, exactly re&s;embling tho&s;e of India, Per&s;ia, and even of Lyons. Be&s;ides the&s;e ar|ticles furni&s;hed at Scio, they make carpets of a very &s;uperb quality at Salonica and Smyrna. Cyprus is famous for coverlets; as Candia is for &s;oap and oil. Santorin produces a kind of cotton &s;tuff, called dimity; and at Tinde they make &s;ilk &s;tockings. In the days of ancient Greece, Samos and Miletus bore the repu|tation of excelling in carpets; Corinth in coverlets; Sicily in chee&s;e; and Argos produced the be&s;t of metals.</P>
<P>The Greeks were early acquainted with the art of navigation, which may be gathered from the number of ve&s;&s;els they fitted out for the expedition again&s;t
<PB N="360" REF="366">
Troy. The pa&s;&s;age from i&s;land to i&s;land, in the Ar|chipelago, and again to the adjacent continents, was not very difficult, by rea&s;on of the vicinity of tho&s;e places. Commerce was then carried on, by barter of one commodity for another. The merchants who fur|ni&s;hed the Greeks with wine from Lemnos, during the &s;iege of Troy; received in return, bra&s;s, iron, &s;kins, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Thieving was no crime among the ancient Greeks, but a calling of ingenuity and indu&s;try. Being held in no di&s;grace, the earlie&s;t navigators became thieves of the fir&s;t rank, under the denomination of pirates. The uncivilized Greeks of the pre&s;ent age, who have pre&s;erved the &s;implicity of the ancient manners, are now the pirates of the Archipelago. In con&s;ulting <HI>Homer,</HI> upon the cu&s;toms of the primitive Greeks, we have the pure&s;t &s;ource of knowledge, on that head, ever before us.</P>
<P><HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> having touched at the i&s;land of Pheacia, <HI>Euryalus</HI> was de&s;irous of provoking him to enter the li&s;ts with him, either in the &s;kilful management of the lute, or the &s;wiftne&s;s of cour&s;e. But <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> declining to engage in either, the young <HI>Euryalus,</HI> who was hot and pa&s;&s;ionate, made u&s;e of the&s;e rough expre&s;&s;ions: "Am I then to con&s;ider you as one of tho&s;e &s;hip-ma&s;ters,
<PB N="361" REF="367">
who pa&s;s their lives in going from place to place, to traffic or plunder; or in the &s;till more de&s;pica|ble light of the pur&s;er of a ve&s;&s;el; one who keeps a re|gi&s;ter of &s;tores and prizes."</P>
<P>The Greeks are, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;eamen by na|ture. The Turki&s;h &s;hips of war are manned with them. They make u&s;e of the compa&s;s, but have no charts to direct them; and are, therefore, obliged to tru&s;t to their knowledge of the coa&s;ts, for the &s;afety of their navigation. They, of cour&s;e, never venture far from the land. Mo&s;t of their &s;hips re&s;emble tho&s;e of the ancients; having but one ma&s;t, which is cro&s;&s;ed with very long yards. They have al&s;o great &s;ails, and a high flat poop, &s;ometimes ornamented; the prow pro|jecting like that of <HI>The&s;eus</HI>'s &s;hip. A Greek may fre|quently be &s;een &s;eated on the poop of his <HI>volik,</HI> &s;ailing on that beautiful canal the Black Sea; the coa&s;ts re|&s;ounding with his lyre; while a favourable wind &s;wel|ling the &s;ails, wafts him along the water with a plea&s;ing rapidity.</P>
<P>Fi&s;hing, which was the prelude, and, if we may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion, the parent of navigation has not been neglected by the Greeks. One of the fine&s;t poems, that ever was handed down to us from the Greeks, was written by <HI>Oppian,</HI> in celebration of the art of fi&s;hing. A poem, in &s;o much e&s;teem in the age
<PB N="362" REF="368">
that produced it, as to obtain the appellation of golden ver&s;es.</P>
<P>Whole nations have followed the art of fi&s;hing, as their only means of &s;upport; while others have de|rived their whole &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from the pur&s;uit of ter|re&s;trial animals. The latter being the mo&s;t healthful and agreeable exerci&s;e, and the &s;ucce&s;s attended with greater <HI>eclat,</HI> has been in all ages, the principal diver|&s;ion of youth, and favourite &s;port of princes and heroes. While, on the other hand, fi&s;hing has been the occu|pation of the meaner &s;ort of people, and attended with greater danger. The Greek fi&s;hermen, de&s;cribed in the hi&s;tory of former times, or on the monuments of antiquity, are exactly repre&s;ented by tho&s;e of the pre&s;ent age; who are provided with the &s;ame kind of implements as their predece&s;&s;ors. Being in general, more &s;kilful and indu&s;trious in their profe&s;&s;ion, than their neighbours; they are al&s;o more &s;ucce&s;sful. Of the indu&s;try of the fi&s;hermen of antiquity, <HI>Strabo</HI> re|lates the following anecdote.</P>
<P>A celebrated mu&s;ician, employing his talents one day in the &s;treets of Ja&s;&s;us, the inhabitants of which were, for the mo&s;t part, fi&s;hermen, drew about him a great number of people. But the &s;ignal being pre|&s;ently given for opening the fi&s;h-market, his whole audience for&s;ook him except one man, who happened
<PB N="363" REF="369">
to be a little deaf. The mu&s;ician, unacquainted with that circum&s;tance, was highly flattered by his atten|tion; felicitated the man on his ta&s;te for mu&s;ic; and prai&s;ed him much, for the regard he had &s;hewn to a piece, which, as the mu&s;ician &s;aid, had great merit. A circum&s;tance the more remarkable in the fi&s;her, con&s;idering what an univer&s;al depravity of ta&s;te ap|peared in his fellow-citizens, by quitting his mu&s;ic at the fir&s;t &s;ound of a bell, to &s;ell their fi&s;h. "How," replies the &s;uppo&s;ed man of ta&s;te; "is the &s;ignal given? I did not hear it." And in&s;tantly followed his brother fi&s;hermen with equal precipitation.</P>
<P><HI>Homer,</HI> who was the fir&s;t to lay all nature under contribution, in order to furni&s;h that crowd of images which are di&s;per&s;ed over his works, did not forget the fi&s;hers. De&s;cribing the defeat of <HI>Penelope</HI>'s &s;uitors, he repre&s;ents them after the combat, "&s;cattered on the ground, and panting for breath; like fi&s;hes taken from the net, ju&s;t thrown upon the &s;hore. Laid in heaps on the dry &s;and," &s;ays <HI>Homer,</HI> "the finney race thir&s;t for the moi&s;t element, which they &s;o long en|joyed. They palpitate in every part, from the heat and avidity of the air, ju&s;t ready to de&s;troy them. Thus fell the lovers of <HI>Penelope.</HI> Thus they found one common grave." <HI>Homer</HI> then mentions fi&s;h|ing with nets; which practice was very ancient in
<PB N="364" REF="370">
Greece, and in Egypt. But the Greeks, according to <HI>Athenaeus,</HI> exi&s;ted &s;ome time before they could eat fi&s;h. And <HI>Dacier</HI> ob&s;erves, that at the &s;iege of Troy, war|riors ab&s;tained from the u&s;e of fi&s;h; as food of too de|licate a nature, for men of that profe&s;&s;ion. <HI>Menelaus,</HI> in the Ody&s;&s;ey, excu&s;es his companions, who re|mained with him in the i&s;land of Pharos, for having fi&s;hed with a line; by ob&s;erving, that hunger had carried them to &s;uch lengths, they were glad to eat whatever they could get.</P>
<P>After the Greeks had adopted the art of fi&s;hing, they brought it to the greate&s;t perfection. <HI>Pollux</HI> has been more particular, than even <HI>Theocritus,</HI> in de|&s;cribing every uten&s;il nece&s;&s;ary for carrying on this employment. It is to them we owe the origin of the <HI>Xiphias,</HI> or &s;word-fi&s;h, carried on by the people of Mar&s;eilles; of the pilchard fi&s;hery, and that of the tunny. This latter fi&s;h appeared formerly in &s;holes, and were e&s;teemed the be&s;t and large&s;t fi&s;h of the &s;ea. A company of them, according to <HI>Pliny,</HI> once pur&s;ued the &s;hips of <HI>Alexander;</HI> his whole &s;leet was &s;eized with terror, and formed them&s;elves into a line, as if at|tacked by an enemy. This fi&s;h was in great e&s;tima|tion among the ancients, as now with the moderns. They were &s;erved at the be&s;t tables; and the Romans, like our&s;elves, greatly e&s;teemed the flavour. Ac|cording
<PB N="365" REF="371">
to <HI>Aulus Gellius,</HI> our pickled tunny, and bo|targo, are more ancient than we imagine. The Car|thaginians always provided the tunny-fi&s;h to be &s;erved at weddings; and it had con&s;tantly a place in the Grecian banquets, before the new-married couple were put to bed.</P>
<P>The tunny-fi&s;h &s;till continue to pa&s;s through the &s;traits of Gibraltar, in large companies, about the commencement of &s;pring. There is a great fi&s;hery of them, as we have before remarked, near Cadiz, at a village called Conil; from which place, and its en|virons, the duke of <HI>Medina Sidonia,</HI> is &s;aid to draw the clear &s;um of eighty thou&s;and ducats yearly.</P>
<P>At Salines, a port in Naxios, an i&s;land of the Archi|pelago, the Greeks have a great fi&s;hery for eels and mullet, by the means of &s;nares made of reeds, and manufactured into a certain form. The&s;e &s;nares are very pliable, and &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, that the fi&s;h once lodged in them cannot get out.</P>
<P>The &s;turgeon-fi&s;hing is al&s;o carried on in a very &s;in|gular manner. An inclo&s;ure of willows with a door, being placed in the water, is &s;o contrived, to admit all the fi&s;h which come that way, without the po&s;&s;ibility of their getting out again.</P>
<P><PB N="366" REF="372">Tunny fi&s;hing is carried on, by the people of Mar&s;eilles, in great perfection, after a manner which they inherit from the Greeks. The fi&s;h are detained by an inclo&s;ure placed in the water, much re&s;embling the folds u&s;ed for inclo&s;ing cattle in the middle of a field.</P>
