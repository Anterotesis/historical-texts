<P>THOSE vain tale-bearing Books, entitled Memoirs, have &s;o far &s;ub|verted Readers, that the truth is to them but a threadbare Garment.</P>
<P>Un&s;atisfied are they with each Hi&s;tory, unle&s;s the Writer delivereth all the Parti|culars, concerning every Per&s;on whom he memoriali&s;es; from the Colour of an Eye|brow, even unto the Pattern of a Shoe-buckle.</P>

SCENE the FIRST.</HEAD>
<STAGE>DANCING MASTER. EDITOR. ZAPHANIEL.</STAGE>
<P>_ONE afternoon as I was preparing a Political E&s;&s;ay, for the next day's Chronicle, in an&s;wer to a letter, I had in&s;erted the week before, on the other &s;ide the que&s;tion, the boy from the blue po&s;ts, &s;aid, two gentlemen wanted me at his ma&s;ter's.</P>
<P>My dear wife, who&s;e prudence, and per&s;on, are unequalled, was unwilling I &s;hould go; but upon recollection, I ventured (not without &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary precaution, I mu&s;t confe&s;s) and was inducted into a room, where two very well look|ing men were &s;eated.</P>
<P>The &s;horte&s;t of them was dre&s;&s;ed in a laced coat, a fine flowered gold and &s;ilver wai&s;tcoat, figured Ruffles, a heart at his &s;hirt bo&s;om made of green and red &s;tones; he had a &s;word and a bunch of ribbands at the handle, and he held a &s;nuff-box in his hand.</P>
<P>As his complexion was of the olive tint, his eyes vacant, his no&s;trils charged with rappee, and his eye-brows, forehead, and other parts of
<PB N="2" REF="8">his face, indicating he much practi&s;ed the look contemptuous, I took him for &s;ome foreign no|bleman, ju&s;t imported: but he was a figure danc|er at the Opera-hou&s;e; and thus he opened the bu&s;ine&s;s to me.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANCING MASTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, we have taken the liberty to &s;end for you; becau&s;e we hear you are an author. That gentleman <STAGE>(pointing to his friend, who wore his own dark brown hair, parted on the top of his head, and &s;m&ograve;othly &s;troked down each &s;ide of his temples, then tucked behind his ears, as you have &s;een window curtains turned back)</STAGE> Mr. Zaphaniel has got &s;ome very curious &s;tories relating to a particular play|er; but he wants to have them put into a pro|per &s;tile.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDITOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>What &s;ort of a &s;tile, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANCING MASTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay as to that, Sir, it will be left to you. I have nothing to &s;ay to &s;tile, for <HI>my</HI> part.&mdash;Gen|tlemen like me never read. I never looked in|to a Book in my life.&mdash;I keep my chariot, Sir, and people now-a-days, don't keep their cha|riots by book reading.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDITOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would you have it in a drole &s;tile, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANCING MASTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Ay, as drole as you can, faith&mdash;touch up all the actors and &s;ingers in it. They are on|ly fit to be made game with; as to the dancers, you may let them alone, only if you can cle|verly throw in any hints about my&s;elf, for I teach mo&s;t of the people of fa&s;hion in town, I am indecd the be&s;t dancer either for execution or addre&s;s, or &s;chool bu&s;ine&s;s, in Europe. I
<PB N="3" REF="9">hate vanity&mdash;but I'll tell you more of my&s;elf, when you come to dine with me.&mdash;Where's the papers, Zaffy?</P>

<SPEAKER>ZAPHANIEL.</SPEAKER>
<P>There they are, tied up together in the win|dow, thou may'&s;t take them home <STAGE>(addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me)</STAGE> peru&s;e the contents: give me thy opinion of them, I will come to thee at the &s;e|venth hour on wedne&s;day next, as this porter &s;eemeth to be very good, we will a&s;&s;emble here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANCING MASTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>But Sir <STAGE>(addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me likewi&s;e)</STAGE> that you may be the better able to under&s;tand what you are about, you &s;hould have an idea of the per&s;on, who this hi&s;tory is wrote upon, there|fore come to me next &s;unday, two o'clock, to dine at Jemmy Warner's, NED will be ther&egrave;, and Nancy with him. NANCY you mu&s;t know, Sir, is a wench he's a friend to, for the fellow faith has a devili&s;h &s;mart &s;ort of a genius for high life; although he is but a player, he keeps his girl, wears embroidery, drinks burned cham|paign, and betts his 50 as freely, as if he was the be&s;t nobleman, or d&aacute;ncing ma&s;ter in Eng|land.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDITOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, you &s;poke &s;omething of mentioning you in the&s;e memoirs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DANCING MASTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mu&s;t know, Sir, there is no doing any good in the world, without puffing. It does not &s;ignify, if you are the clevere&s;t fellow that can be, in your way, without you can puff your|&s;elf off, or get your friends to puff you off, you will never get forwards; for it is not now the que&s;tion, whether an arti&s;t is a genius? But whe|ther
<PB N="4" REF="10">he is in fa&s;hion? Now there are &s;everal ways of managing this bringing a man into fa&s;h|ion; &s;ome chu&s;e to bribe a very great lady's hair-dre&s;&s;er; others get into fa&s;hion 'cau&s;e their fathers have a vote, or their &s;i&s;ter a pretty face, or they were born on this &s;ide, or that &s;ide Ber|wick-bridge; or, becau&s;e&mdash;becau&s;e&mdash;in &s;hort, Sir, there are many &s;chemes, but I don't like any of them half &s;o well, as printing your me|rits in the news papers, or writing a book about it.</P>
<P>I was let into the &s;ecret by my ma&s;ter, who got all his money by adverti&s;ing. For, as he &s;aid, never mind what other people &s;ay, do you &s;ay as much as you can for your&s;elf; and keep at it; and if you will go on telling the town, &s;o you will talk them into it, until they believe every &s;yllable about you.</P>
<P>The MSS. I took home with me, and, being promi&s;ed ready money, began to dige&s;t the ma|terials immediately.</P>

<P>Thus was Mr. Thomas Ap Morgan, a Welch chairman, very vehemently telling his mind to David Llwhyddwhuydd, his partner. David mild|ly replying, you know, my dear countryman, that now I am the very la&s;t, look you, of all the Llwhyddwhuydds in all Wales, and will any countryman of mine, any true Briton, and there are no true Britons but Welch folks, you know, Thomas.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>THOMAS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, to be &s;ure I do, and thank God for that, I am but a Welchman truly, but I am a true Briton, and Britons never will be &s;laves; and therefore why &s;hould your wife want to bite my no&s;e then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAVID.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, Thomas, would you have the mo&s;t anciente&s;t family in all Wales, and all Merio|neth&s;hire to boot, as indeed mine is, to be ex|tingui&s;hed, rather than let your&s;elf be put to a little pain; and if my wife &s;hould mi&s;carry, there is an end of all my hopes; for only Providence and good Sir Watkins knows, when I &s;hall be able to get another child; for we have been a long time about this; and if we lo&s;e this, all my hopes of having a family to inherit my nam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is gone; becau&s;e, you know, we have never a|nother child in the world, but that which is coming to be born now.</P>
</SP>
<P><PB N="6" REF="12">Thomas picking up his hat, and wiping the flaps of it with his elbow, replied, you know, David, that I would not have Mrs. Llwhyddw|huydd vexed now &s;he is &s;o near her down-lying, upon any account; but why &s;hould you &s;ay yours is the mo&s;t anciente&s;t family in Wales, did not the Ap Morgans go to meet William the conqueror?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAVID.</SPEAKER>
<P>God's ble&s;&s;ings upon us both, I am a&s;hamed to hear a Welchman talk of any thing &s;o little a while ago as William the conqueror; why my family, I have all the parchment account of it at home, was in Wales before the deluge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>THOMAS.</SPEAKER>
<P>But where did they go when the world was drownded?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAVID.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why they went on board &s;hip with Captain Noah, and the &s;hip &s;ettled upon a very high mountain, and the mountain was Penmanmuir, and Wales was the fir&s;t place peopled again; and Japhet married into our family, and I have &s;ome of his blood now in my veins, and our family has been in Merioneth&s;hire ever &s;ince. Now here lies the point, my dear. Suppo&s;e my &s;on, becau&s;e my wife &s;hould lo&s;e her longing, is to be born without a no&s;e, or <STAGE>(God help us)</STAGE> with two no&s;es now; for great authors &s;ay, that a woman with child, when &s;he longs, or is affrighted the effects will be the &s;ame upon the child.</P>

<P>But I will &s;hew you, friend Thomas, from the te&s;timony of learned wi&s;e men <STAGE>(pulling a book out of his pocket)</STAGE> I copied them with my own hand-writing, to convince you of the dan|ger, that may attend letting my wife, that you profe&s;s &s;o much friend&s;hip for, lo&s;e her longing.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>THOMAS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, you know, Mr. David, I love to hear hi&s;tories, &s;o let us &s;it down. <STAGE>They did &s;o; and Mr. Lwhyddwuyd began to read the te&s;ti|monies of the learned, as follows;</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<P>CASE. I.</P>
<P><HI>Aldrovandus</HI> relates, that a woman in Sicily ob&s;erving a lob&s;ter taken by a fi&s;herman, and being moved by an earne&s;t longing for it, brought forth a lob&s;ter, altogether like what &s;he had &s;een and longed for.&mdash;Vide the copper|plate.</P>
<P N="2">II. Is told by <HI>John Swammerdam.</HI> A certain woman at Utrecht, being with child, was frighted with the &s;ight of a negro, and appre|hended to be delivered of a perfect black; but at la&s;t recollecting her&s;elf, &s;he made u&s;e of a &s;econd imagination, to prevent the danger from the fir&s;t; for &s;he wa&s;hed her&s;elf from head to foot, with hot water, to clear the child from blackne&s;s. The time of her delivery being
<PB N="8" REF="15">come, the child was born with all his teeth, and appeared perfectly white, except tho&s;e places, the hot water did not reach.</P>
<P N="3">III. By ditto. A child was born in Normandy with horns upon his head, and cloven feet, and he proved afterwards to be a man of extraordi|nary &s;en&s;e and judgment: the occa&s;ion of that misfortune was, that his father having repre|&s;ented a &s;atyr upon the &s;tage, had the knowledge of his wife in that ridiculous dre&s;s.</P>
<P N="4">IV. We have a ca&s;e in <HI>Fabricius Hildanus,</HI> upon the faith of <HI>Ludovicus Horniceus,</HI> a phy|&s;ician of Frankfort, viz. a woman having been frighted with the firing of a gun, was delivered of a child with a wound in the back, of the &s;ame &s;hape, as if it had been done with a mu&s;|quet &s;hot.</P>
<P N="5">V. Father <HI>Malebranche,</HI> in his &s;earch after truth, relates, that &s;even or eight years ago, was &s;een in the ho&s;pital of incurables a young man, who was born an idoet; and who&s;e body was broken in the &s;ame places where malefactors are broke; he had lived near twenty years in that condition, and has been &s;een by &s;everal per&s;ons. The cau&s;e was, his mother hearing a criminal was to be broke, went to &s;ee the exe|cution.</P>
<P>Father <HI>Malebranche</HI> proceeds to explain this &s;trange accident: children, &s;ays he, &s;ee what their mothers &s;ee; they hear the &s;ame cries, they receive the &s;ame impre&s;&s;ions of the objects, and are moved by the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions; all the blows given to the malefactor did violently &s;trike the
<PB N="9" REF="16">mother's imagination; and by the counterblow, the tender and &s;oft brain of the child.&mdash;The fibres of the child's brain, not being able to re|&s;i&s;t the torrent of the &s;pirits, were broken; that's the rea&s;on why he came into the world without under&s;tanding. The violent cour&s;e of the mother's animal &s;pirits went with force from her brains to the &s;everal parts of her body, which an&s;wered to the parts of the malefactor: 'twas the &s;ame in the child&mdash;but becau&s;e the bones of the mother were capable to re&s;i&s;t the violence of the &s;pirits, they were not wounded. But this rapid &s;tream of the &s;pirits was capable to carry away the &s;oft and tender parts of the bones of the child; and 'tis to be ob&s;erved, that if the mother had determined the motion of the &s;pirits, toward any other part of the body, her child had not had his bones broke; but that part which an&s;wered to the part towards which the mother determined her &s;pirits had been &s;ore|ly wounded.</P>
<P N="6">VI. A gentlewoman of Hel&s;enor, &s;ays <HI>Bar|tholin,</HI> was delivered of a great cat; which, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of the a&s;&s;i&s;tants, ran away with great celerity, and was never &s;een afterwards&mdash;becau&s;e the lady was frightened with one.</P>
<P N="7">VII. <HI>Bartholin</HI> al&s;o relates; I have it, he &s;ays from <HI>John Naborou&s;ky,</HI> a gentleman of Poland, and my good friend, that a woman of that country was brought to bed of two &s;mall fi&s;hes, without &s;cales; which were no &s;ooner born, but they &s;wam in the neighbouring waters, as naturally as others do; becau&s;e the lady did long for them; &s;o that you &s;ee, my friend Thomas,
<PB N="10" REF="17">look you, it is all the &s;ame, according to the o|pinions of the&s;e learned people, whether a lady is frighted, or whether a lady longs.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>THOMAS:</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, let us hear &s;ome more &s;tories, in the Name of God.&mdash;I do love to hear &s;uch things, to be &s;ure; but God help me, for my own &s;ake, but to be &s;ure I cannot believe all the&s;e things, &s;o well as the &s;cholars do, becau&s;e I have not their learning; but go on, do my friend, do go on. <STAGE>Which reque&s;t David obeyed immediately.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<P N="8">VIII. <HI>Philippus Meurs,</HI> apo&s;tolical prothono|tary, and cannon of St. Peter's in Louvain, a re|verend ancient man, affirmed unto me, and &s;e|veral others, &s;ays our author, <HI>Thomas Fienus,</HI> that he had a &s;i&s;ter compleat in the re&s;t of her body, but without a head. In&s;tead of which, was joined to her neck a &s;hell fi&s;h, in the like|ne&s;s of a &s;ea-mu&s;cle, made up of two &s;hells, which &s;hut and opened; and by which, from a &s;poon, &s;he took her nouri&s;hment. And this he &s;aid was occa&s;ioned, for that the mother with child with her had a &s;trong de&s;ire after &s;ome mu&s;cles &s;he beheld in the market, but could not procure at that in&s;tant. This &s;i&s;ter of his lived in this mon&s;trous condition, to be eleven years old; and then, by accident, happening angrily, and very &s;trongly, to bite the &s;poon they fed her with, and breaking the &s;hells, died quickly after.</P>
<P N="9">IX. <HI>Schenkius</HI> tells of a woman very big; who, among other di&s;cour&s;es with her neighbours, mention being made of her great belly, &s;he told them, &s;he reckoned about the time of Epiphany,
<PB N="11" REF="18">or fe&s;tival of the three kings. Upon which the good woman wi&s;hing &s;he might bring forth three kings; &s;he merrily an&s;wered, with all her heart; and accordingly, at the time, &s;he bore three &s;ons; one of them an Ethiopian, or of a black colour, as u&s;ually one of tho&s;e kings are painted. The &s;ame relation is confirmed by <HI>Cornel. Gemma,</HI> being &s;een, as he &s;ays, by great multitudes, in the city of Louvain, and authenticated by un|doubted te&s;timony.</P>
<P N="10">X. There was a lady, a kin&s;woman of mine, &s;ays Sir <HI>Kenelm Digby,</HI> who u&s;ed much to wear black patches upon her face (a fa&s;hion among young women) which I, to put her from, u&s;ed to tell her in je&s;t, that the next child &s;he &s;hould go with, &s;hould come into the world with a great black &s;pot in the mid&s;t of its forehead; and the apprehen&s;ion was &s;o lively in her ima|gination, that &s;he had a daughter born, and marked ju&s;t as the mother had fancied, with a great black &s;pot upon her.</P>
<P N="11">XI. There lived among&s;t us at Bern in Swit|zerland, &s;ays <HI>Gul. Fabricius,</HI> an hone&s;t woman, who, about ten years &s;ince, being great with child, and quarrelling with another woman, put her&s;elf into &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ion, that &s;he was unable to con|tain her&s;elf. After which, falling into labour, &s;he was brought to bed of a daughter, of a cou|ragious and heroick mind, but her feet and hands contracted, as if ready to fight, and her whole body in continual motion, &s;o that &s;he walks, as it were, dancing, and in a trembling po&s;ture, after the manner of angry people, unable to govern their pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P N="12"><PB N="12" REF="19">XII. <HI>Amb. Parey</HI> gives us to under&s;tand, that in the year 1517, a child was born (in a village near Fontainbleau) with the &s;hape of its face exactly like that of a frog; which was brought to pa&s;s by the mother's holding that creature in her hand, to allay the heat of a fever, about the time of her conception.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. But &s;omething &s;ingular beyond all the&s;e, is the tale of <HI>Languis,</HI> of a woman longing to bite the naked &s;houlder of a baker pa&s;&s;ing by her; which, rather than &s;he &s;hould lo&s;e her longing, the good-natured hu&s;band hired the baker at a certain price. Accordingly, when the big-bellied woman had bit twice, the baker's wife broke a|way from the people who held her, would not &s;uffer her to bite her hu&s;band again; for want of which, &s;he bore one dead child, with two living ones.</P>
<P>Why then, I &s;ay (thus Thomas very loudly began, hitting his hand hard upon the table) I &s;ay, the baker was&mdash;.</P>
<P>At that in&s;tant a voice from the &s;treet called chair, chair; out run Mr. David and Mr. Tho|mas, the book, the no&s;e, the wife, were in an in&s;tant forgot; for the occult de&s;ire of money-getting annihilates all other con&s;iderations, as black ab&s;orbs all factitious colours.</P>
<P>How the chairman came to be &s;o learned (as we all love to know every thing) courteous rea|der, you &s;hall, if you plea&s;e, be informed.</P>
<P>Upwards of twenty years had he taken in the Magazines, and had made &s;o many ab&s;tracts, and remembered &s;o many extracts, that if he had

<PB N="13" REF="21">not been a chairman, he might have been made honorary profe&s;&s;or of univer&s;al erudition.</P>
<P>He was the living Lexicon, to which the whi&s;t and jockey clubs applied, whenever they made a bett about &s;pelling a word; and he had, from ob&s;ervation, acquired &s;uch a genius or power in di&s;putation, that all &s;matterers he &s;ilenced, as ea&s;ily as Socrates did the Sophi&s;ts; if a true &s;cho|lar happened to contradict him, David, from his knowledge of the world, dumfounded the &s;tu|dent, by offering him ten pound on't; for he proceeded upon one general, and not an often controverted principle, <HI>i. e.</HI> no rich men will mind learning; <HI>ergo,</HI> only poor folks are &s;cho|lars.</P>
<P>Therefore every fool, every dunce, dares to a&s;&s;ert, to contradict, to find fault, or prai&s;e; even with the utmo&s;t ignorant effrontery, and oppo&s;e the opinions of men of real merit&mdash;blockheads having one undeniable re&s;ource, the propo&s;ing a wager.</P>
<P>Mrs. Llwhyddwhuydd, ma&s;ter Neddy's mama, was born in America, the daughter of a mulatto woman, her papa, the famous councellor Ju&s;tice, who was &s;ent abroad on account of &s;ome books being mi&s;&s;ing. The grandfather's di&s;grace is the rea&s;on why none of his de&s;cendants ever cho&s;e to learn their letters.</P>
<P>Hence, as <HI>Hein&s;ius</HI> ob&s;erves, it is very ea&s;y to account for the Hero of this Hi&s;tory being illiterate.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Ju&s;tice was imported under-cook to a We&s;t-Indian family, who came to England for improvement; they hired a fine hou&s;e the &s;outh &s;ide of Maid&s;tone, within half a mile exactly
<PB N="14" REF="22">of the market-place, and on the right-hand of the London road.</P>
<P>N. B. <HI>The utmo&s;t preci&s;ion is made u&s;e of in re|lating the &s;ituation of the hou&s;e, becau&s;e an attention to truth is the Editor's greate&s;t care throughout the whole of this publication.</HI></P>
<P>In Maid&s;tone, at this time, there was a compa|ny of Comedians, that town and county being remarkable for the re&s;idence of &s;uch &s;ort of peo|ple. It is an ob&s;ervation of naturali&s;ts, that turnips and attornies thrive be&s;t in Norfolk; that Su&s;&s;ex is noted for bad roads and &s;mug|glers; and that it is as impo&s;&s;ible to eradicate buggs from London, as to free Kent from Hop|pickers, Gip&s;ies, and Stroling Players.</P>
<P>In all rural theatrical communities, it is the cu&s;tom of one of the actors to carry play-bills to the people of fa&s;hion's hou&s;es about the coun|try; and as the&s;e Jamaica gentlefolks were re|markable for &s;umptuous living, the manager ca&s;t him&s;elf into that part of the bu&s;ine&s;s; this occa&s;ioned much murmuring when his back was turned, among the re&s;t of the company; they would meet at the ale-hou&s;e, and call him all the &s;coundrels, and tyrants imaginable; but the moment they &s;aw him returning, they run out of the room, begged he would drink with them, and happy was he; who could get his handker|chief out fir&s;t, to wipe the du&s;t off from his ma&s;|ter's &s;hoes. He loved, like mo&s;t of his brethren, eleemo&s;inary high living, therefore he never mi&s;&s;ed carrying up a bill every morning to the We&s;t Indian &s;quires; and u&s;ed to wait in the hall, at fir&s;t, along with the butcher's boy, to know their honours commands.</P>

<P><PB N="15" REF="24">But Mi&s;s Ju&s;tice, being very fond of players, a&s;ked this proprietor of cloaths and &s;cenes to &s;tep into the pantry, where the re&s;t of the &s;ervants a&s;&s;embled, there he was treated with &s;everal remnants of danties &s;aved from ye&s;terday's din|ner, and he made the kitchen company va&s;tly merry, for he could be exqui&s;itely entertaining.</P>
<P>He &s;poke Tragedy &s;peeches to them, he &s;how|ed them tricks, he made them faces, he &s;ung &s;ongs, he acted the lame man, and the &s;tutter|ing man, and &s;tood upon his head, and drank out of his &s;hoe, no man had more wit than he had; and he rehear&s;ed all the other comicalities, by which benefit-making geniu&s;es pu&s;h their tickets off. The young lady above-mentioned fell in love with this ma&s;ter actor, his name, or at lea&s;t the name he went by, was Samly; and as Mr. Samly was &s;eeing Mi&s;s Ju&s;tice home from the play-hou&s;e, in about a week afterwards, &s;he confe&s;&s;ed her affection to him, and informed him, that &s;he had forty nine pounds of her own, and in her own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, all in &s;pecie.</P>
<P>Samly immediately fell in love with her, they vowed eternal fidelity to each other, and rati|fied tho&s;e vows by the mo&s;t particular engage|ment, before they went out of the home clo&s;e, while the bright &s;tars in the fiery fretted canopy of heaven &s;parkled over their heads, and the &s;ilent gloworms twinkled at their &s;ides, the leafy hedges ru&s;tling to their embraces, and the whoping owls at di&s;tance toot tooting to their &s;ighs (as Mr. Samly ob&s;erved) made up great nature's loving concert. The next week, unknown to any of their acquaintance, they &s;et out for London together; Samly left his cloaths and &s;cenes behind him; indeed they were mortgag|ed
<PB N="16" REF="25">for rather more than the worth, to the land|lord of the &s;table in which they acted.</P>
<P>The Editor of this Treati&s;e remembers this Mr. Samly's company at Maid&s;tone, and they had the u&s;e of a brewhou&s;e to &s;hift their cloaths in; the ladies dre&s;&s;ing-place was the ma&s;h-tub, and Alexander the Great, he has known to re|hear&s;e his mad &s;cene very cleverly in the cooler.</P>
<P>The brace of lovers determined to remain in cog for &s;ome time in London; becau&s;e, as Mi&s;s Ju&s;tice &s;aid, what would all the world think of her, if all the world &s;hould come to know it? therefore de&s;ired Mr. Samly would get a licence as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>That he promi&s;ed upon his honour &s;hould be his next morning's bu&s;ine&s;s; and added, at the &s;ame time, <HI>my ineffable Chloe, we will content our&s;elves with the&s;e lodgings for the pre&s;ent; what to thee or me does it a drachma &s;ignify, if as yet, we are at St. Giles</HI>'s <HI>or St. James</HI>'s&mdash;<HI>no, we are our&s;elves, let us be where we plea&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the in&s;tant he brandi&s;hed his lady's cur|ling irons, with which he was then pinching his bag wig.&mdash;Maje&s;tically he &s;trode cro&s;s the room, and then with mo&s;t emphatical dignity&mdash;he&mdash;&s;pit out of the window.</P>
<P>Re&s;uming his &s;ubject, thus he went on&mdash;<HI>be|fore the winter comes on, thou opening ro&s;e of beau|ty, we'll take a ready furni&s;hed hou&s;e in &s;ome of the genteel &s;quares about Piccadilly.

<P>His ca&s;e was very &s;evere, he had a great mind to print it, to let the town know how he was u&s;ed; he did &s;o, but it did not an&s;wer any pur|po&s;e; the public took no notice of it, and the book&s;eller lo&s;t money by it.</P>
<P>His lady's fortune being &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated, duns grew exceedingly impertinent, misfortunes pre|&s;ented them&s;elves before him, in all the fright|ful phantoms of hunger, bad &s;hoes, bum bailiffs, rainy weather, no tru&s;t, and an empty coal-hole; he cur&s;ed the pride of managers, their ignorance, their inhumanity; he damned the town, he de|&s;pi&s;ed life, he grew de&s;perate; and one morning, before the fringed covering of his lady's eye-lights were withdrawn, he went down &s;tairs, and opening the &s;treet-door, he, I am afraid it will never be believed, but the fact is authentic, and I can bring &s;everal reputable people to wit|ne&s;s the truth of it,&mdash;he, that very morning, re&s;olved&mdash;to work at his own bu&s;ine&s;s, and relinqui&s;h the &s;tage for ever, &s;aying, with Car|dinal Wol&s;ey,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Adorable,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I con&s;ider life, 'tis all a cheat; as to the managers, bla&s;t &s;uch &s;coun|drels; however, I'm re&s;igned to fate, whatever world I next am thrown upon, cannot be wor&s;e than this&mdash;as I am now determined to rennounce the follys, pa&s;&s;ions and delights of de&s;ire, I have been obliged to leave thee, my life and &s;oul, my all that heaven can give; what can I do, while there was one thing my charmer had

<P>I leave you in good hands, I know my land|lord loves you; and if during my exile, as he is rich, you admit him into my throne, only for a time, why it will be political; I give you leave, as it may expedite my recall. As Congreve &s;ays, he takes your body, I your mind. I mu&s;t have the better bargain&mdash;remember this is my reque&s;t, nay, my command to yield your&s;elf up to one per&s;on, for the &s;ake of another, and what is done by the fine&s;t women in England, and what I would do for you, with the fine&s;t woman in England.</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>Adieu.</SALUTE></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>After Samly had put the letter in the po&s;t|office, he recollected his dear Chloe could not read&mdash;however, upon reflection, he was not &s;orry for that; <HI>for, by heavens, and all the ingenuity of arts and &s;ciences,</HI> he called out, <HI>it is an elegant Epi&s;tle, equal to any of Pope's literary corre&s;pondence; and whoever my girl gets to read my letter for her, will and mu&s;t admire the writer, and with me lament the lo&s;s which the town mu&s;t receive, by tho&s;e fellows of managers not employing me.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="29">Ju&s;t as the epi&s;tle above-mentioned came to hand, it happened that Mi&s;s Shred was upon a vi&s;it to Mi&s;s Ju&s;tice, or Mrs. Samly, as &s;he was called in the neighbourhood. This young lady, the vi&s;itor, had a very great ta&s;te for plays her|&s;elf, and was an occa&s;ional actre&s;s at Richmond, and at Bartholomew Fair; her father has been breeches &s;eater to me the&s;e nine years, and it was from his mouth, that I have been a&s;&s;ured of the authenticity of this relation.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Mi&s;s Ju&s;tice had heard the letter read, &s;he &s;hrieked, &s;he &s;tamped, &s;he wrung her hands, &s;he took &s;alts: not Ariadne for the lo&s;s of The&s;eus; not a quean condemned to the ducking-&s;tool; not&mdash;but no allu&s;ions could carricature her. Her lamentations brought up the landlord Mr. Llwhyddwhuydd, to whom Mi&s;s Shred di&s;covered Samly's perfidy, although &s;he did not &s;how him the letter, but begged Mr. David would leave the lady a little until &s;he came to her&s;elf. As it is good manners to do &s;o, we will attend the chair&mdash;carrying gentleman down &s;tairs, who rejoiced exceedingly at the two pieces of good news, as he called them.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, to find Mr. Samly was not her hu&s;band; and in the next place, to &s;uppo&s;e Mr. Samly was run away from her; for David long had loved, long had he &s;ecretly admired her.</P>
<P>The tender God of &s;oft de&s;ires rou&s;ed all the &s;entimental &s;oul of Llwhyddwhuydd, &s;oftning his heart, as vinegar will render marble &s;upple.</P>
<P>'Twas on the 4th day after Mr. Samly and his Chloe had taken the lodgings, that Mi&s;s Ju&s;tice fryed &s;ome beef &s;takes and onions for Mr. Samly's dinner, and invited their land|lord to the fea&s;t; &s;o reli&s;hing was the &s;auce,

<PB N="21" REF="31">&s;o cri&s;p the vegetables, that the landlord thought her the fine&s;t woman he ever &s;aw; but when, on the next day, he di&s;covered her darning &s;o nicely her gallant's &s;tocking, which, like a French chicken glove, &s;he had drawn upon her arm, while Samly was rehear&s;ing Othello, the conque&s;t was complete, he became perfectly her &s;lave, and &s;ighing, vowed, upon his honour, madam Samly was the mo&s;t compleate&s;t gentle|woman to look to, that ever he did &s;ee in all his life. Da&s;h not the book down, oh ye de|licate, becau&s;e I have related unembelli&s;hed the beginning of love. &mdash; Love has many begin|nings, but one ending. Love is like the city of London in a map of England, and the &s;en&s;es are the turnpike roads on which travellers trot to it. Love is like the tunes in the Beg|gars Opera, nay, its like the Beggars Opera it&s;elf; becau&s;e the cata&s;trophe is often brought about very unexpectedly.</P>
<P>Men have odd ta&s;tes; why then &s;hould David be blamed for this? Is it not common for ladies to relate the &s;urpri&s;ing conque&s;ts they have made over their hu&s;bands, and the &s;imple means by which tho&s;e victories have been obtained. Ma|dam Blanch avowed to me, her &s;pou&s;e fell in love with her for her &s;mall ear. The deputy's wife &s;hot her good man with a pair of black &s;attin &s;hoes, and &s;tone buckles; the motion of the hips in walking has made many lady's for|tune. E&s;quire Pointer declared but la&s;t week, he was particularly &s;truck with the white point of his wife's elbow: and with all-becoming re|verence for the marriage &s;tate do I &s;peak this, as I am my&s;elf in that nuptial band, I was won to &s;urrender my liberty to the all excellent graces
<PB N="22" REF="32">of my wife, who, in her virgin &s;tate, alarmed my eager de&s;ires, when &s;he threw her&s;elf into that mo&s;t graceful attitude of tying her garter. Here I mu&s;t beg leave to be indulged with &s;ome anecdotes concerning my &s;pou&s;e.</P>
<P>She was born, &s;he was bred a gentlewoman, I married her out of Sir Trinket Trolly's family; her mamma was companion to lady Trolly, and my wife, born in that hou&s;e, was educated in all the becoming elegance, inherent to a woman of the fir&s;t quality.</P>
<P>While I paid my addre&s;&s;es to her, &s;everal wealthy trade&s;men proffered her their &s;ervices; but her &s;oul was above mixing with vulgarities. She &s;corned to li&s;ten to the voice of mechanic money-loving-&s;laves, &s;he valued the addre&s;&s;es of a man of wit, more than all Peru.</P>
<P>On that hint I &s;poke,</P>
<Q><L><HI>She lov'd me for the &s;tories which I told;</HI></L>
<L><HI>And I loved her, 'cau&s;e &s;he did li&s;ten to them.</HI></L></Q>
<P>The rules of politene&s;s obliged us to leave the afflicted Mi&s;s Ju&s;tice, when decency de&s;ired Davy to go down &s;tairs; but now we have liberty again to walk into her apartment.&mdash;Sit down, good reader, you are very welcome, the young lady is pretty well recovered, a &s;erenity beams upon her brow, there is not the lea&s;t print of affliction's foot&s;teps to be &s;een upon her countenance.</P>
<P>But this calmne&s;s was not owing either to the affected pedantry of &s;chool &s;toici&s;m, called philo&s;ophy, which hone&s;t teague, who never read a page of Seneca, &s;o well defined, by &s;ay|ing, by <HI>Ja&s;us I am born to be unhappy, &s;o I'll make my&s;elf very ea&s;y about the matter.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="33">Neither was the young lady of &s;o callous a con&s;titution, as to be ea&s;ily reconciled to the departure of her gallant, by the method which the pre&s;ent females of intrigue make u&s;e of, viz. immediately to throw them&s;elves in the way of another&mdash;no, this happy re&s;toration was ef|fected by that never-failing No&s;trum, Nants Brandy.

<P>Yes&mdash;I mu&s;t confe&s;s, a wit was the fir&s;t man who really had me, that is, critically &s;peaking, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed my &s;oul; as to my per&s;on, that was merely pa&s;&s;ive, in all tho&s;e other con|nections, to which my intere&s;t made me &s;ubmit; becau&s;e, as I was then upon the town, and my inclinations not being engaged with my em|braces, I was as indifferent to the performance as an actre&s;s, when &s;he plays a part don't plea&s;e her.</P>
<P>In London, madam, there are men, as well as women, on the town, and they go by the names of Wits, and Droles, and Clever-fellows, and Choice Spirits; whether they give the&s;e titles to them&s;elves, or other people call them &s;o, its no matter, but they are &s;ent for into company to divert people of fa&s;hion, with what they can do, ju&s;t as girls are, I mean, madam, in the way of &s;inging and &s;aying comic things, and telling &s;tories.</P>
<P>It is a &s;hame though, men &s;hould expo&s;e them|&s;elves &s;o, becau&s;e they are all of them bred to trades, and might get their livings hone&s;tly and decently, if they were not a &s;et of lazy, mean-&s;pirited, and conceited fellows.</P>
<P>Now when any of our &s;ex is bla&s;ted, it is all up with us, we are unhappy enough to be reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of going into company, or &s;tarving; no body will employ us in an ho|ne&s;t way; becau&s;e a girl who is forced to be a whore for her livelihood, is looked upon (e&s;pe|cially
<PB N="25" REF="35">by all good chri&s;tians) to be the mo&s;t con|temptible creature upon the face of the earth.</P>
<P>I &s;ent a card to one of the&s;e wits and geni|u&s;es to &s;up with me; the con&s;equence of which you may naturally &s;uppo&s;e &mdash; we went to bed together. &mdash; Really I loved him infinitely, for he was not only va&s;tly clever, but immen&s;ely odd, and that, you know, takes with our &s;ex im|moderately.</P>
<P>But he &s;oon behaved as all &s;uch &s;ort of peo|ple will, horridly ingrateful. For after I had paid all his debts (they were not large, indeed, becau&s;e no &s;hops would give him much credit) new cloathed him, and put money in his pocket, he u&s;ed me&mdash;as &s;urlily, as if I had been his wife; had I really been married to him, he cou'd not have treated me wor&s;e.</P>
<P>The word fool, fool; was perpetually his an|&s;wer, not only to me, but to all his acquain|tance; we were all fools, he &s;wore, and yet in the whole fifteen months of our cohabitation, tho' he called every body bockheads, yet he never did one rational, or ju&s;t thing: but by chance; he could repartee drolely, tell very high &s;tories, argue charmingly upon all &s;ubjects, make &s;ongs as fa&s;t as I could cut out cap-patterns; but his words and his deeds were no more alike, than the &s;ign of a dolphin, and a real one.</P>
<P>He once wrote a book in prai&s;e of neatne&s;s in dre&s;s, of elegace, and of decency, he was three weeks about it, and in all that time, never wa&s;hed his hands, face or teeth once. &mdash; Cleanline&s;s, or dirt, was all the &s;ame to him, money or no money &mdash; only let him but get into company, 'was all he cared for, when he had no money, he was to&s;&s;ed into the reckon|ings
<PB N="26" REF="36">when he got three or four guineas, he threw it away; and he would &s;ooner &s;it without &s;hifting him&s;elf for a fortnight, in a night cellar, if he had no body left that he could make laugh but link boys, than be regular to the bounds of decency and dome&s;tic enjoyments.</P>
<P>He grew &s;o overbearing at la&s;t, &s;o irregular and &s;o ob&s;tinate, that I could not bear it &mdash; he &s;corned to be talked to, and too proud to &s;ay he had ever been in the wrong &mdash; he was in|deed, as all wits are, irre&s;olute and froward as a baby, giddy as a drunken man, ab&s;ent as a lunatic, as difficult to be plea&s;ed as a vex|ed ideot, and conceited as an Opera Singer.</P>
<P>Oh, my dear, never have any thing to do with your geniu&s;es, unle&s;s you can get one of them now and then to write a &s;ong upon you, for that very often helps a lady to many a good friend&mdash;but for all that, I never would have any connection with &s;uch &s;ort of &s;parks&mdash;as to granting a man that made a good &s;ong upon me a favour, <HI>ang pa&s;&s;awnt,</HI> as the French &s;ay, I &s;hould not mind it&mdash;but don't never, dear crea|ture, be fond of them&mdash;no&mdash;the only men worth a lady's notice, are tho&s;e gentlemen, who have no wit indeed, but then they have what is better than all the wit, genius and under&s;tand|ing in the world&mdash;and what mo&s;t commonly wit, genius and under&s;tanding never have any thing to do with; and that is, MONEY&mdash;<HI>Money,</HI> my dear. Let but a lady have that&mdash;and &s;he is &s;ure of having, doing, &s;aying, and being, ju&s;t what &s;he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>The next per&s;on to whom I was prede&s;tinated, happened to be neither a wit nor a &s;cholar, ne|verthele&s;s he was both a genius and a gentleman, becau&s;e he was a game&s;ter. As daring as a lyon,
<PB N="27" REF="37">he would as &s;oon draw his &s;word as his &s;nuff-box, and was as quick as volatile &s;alts.</P>
<P>He valued his honour before any other con&s;i|deration, in the way of playing any game at cards or dice; for he would &s;ooner venture his life than be found out, &s;o careful was he of his honour. You can't imagine how polite he was, and what fine company he kept, although, as I told you, he could hardly write his name, or &s;pell a word of two &s;yllables; but a gentleman's being ignorant of letters, is no proof again&s;t his politene&s;s; for really, I believe, it would go very hard with &s;ome folks of the be&s;t company, if they were to be examined concerning their reading and writing.</P>

<HEAD>SCENE MATRIMONY.</HEAD>
<P>ON the wedding-night, after the raptures of enjoyment between Mr. and Madam Llwhyddwhudd were evaporated; when every heart-felt thrill and throb of de&s;ire &s;ub&s;ided; each fine &s;tring of delight, which had been ex|tatic &s;tretched by imagination's apparatus, let down into a philo&s;ophic relaxation, the new married pair lay back to back. &mdash; The lady being mo&s;t re&s;tle&s;s, was con&s;idering, whether it would, or would not, offend the rules of delicacy, if &s;he was once again to turn to her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Her &s;pou&s;e was then debating, &s;ince he had married &s;o good a cook, and &s;o notable a wo|man, about making his hou&s;e a public one; which he did the winter following, and had great bu&s;ine&s;s, among the be&s;t people in the neighbourhood; his &s;pou&s;e being &s;o obliging a landlady, occa&s;ioned the famous TRIPE AND TROTTER CLUB, to be in&s;tituted at Mr. Llwhyddwhuydd's.</P>
<P>THE TRIPE AND TROTTER CLUB, was the original of all the other Clubs now exi&s;ting in this metropolis. &mdash; From thence came the famous Beef-&s;take Clubs, the Whi&s;t Clubs, the Ox-cheek Clubs, the Jockey Clubs, the Hornpipe Clubs, the Pea-&s;oup Clubs, the Choice Spirit Clubs, the Spirituous Liquor Clubs, the Poli|tical Clubs, the Philo&s;ophical Clubs, the Roa&s;t|ing Clubs, the Punning Clubs, the Spouting Clubs, the Kept Mi&s;&s;es Clubs, and the Club of Di&s;contents.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="44">David, as he began to get money, grew a&s;thmatical and pot-bellied; not breathing &s;o freely as he was won't to do, it frighten'd him; like the re&s;t of the wealth accumulating part of mankind, he was terrified at the thoughts of dying, therefore &s;ent for a phy&s;ician immedi|ately.</P>
<P>Reader, you mu&s;t have known &s;uch per&s;ons, who, while they worked for their living, were u&s;eful members to &s;ociety; but when, by chance or craft, they become ma&s;ters of money, a&s;|&s;umed a haughtine&s;s of behaviour, abandoning them&s;elves to a vitiated &s;tate of idlene&s;s, and gluttony. The event is, their being &s;eized with a complication of infirmities, which, in their active and prai&s;e-worthy &s;tate, they felt not; they hurry to a doctor, give five guineas for ad|vice, in hopes to have a worthle&s;s carca&s;e &s;heath|ed from the worms; which, was it to continue on the earth for twenty years longer, would not be of five &s;hillings u&s;e to any of its fellow creatures.</P>
<P>David, by his phy&s;ician's order, was to re|turn to his former trade; this he had entirely left off; his &s;oul, as he &s;aid, being always ra|ther above &s;uch an employment; but when health is concerned, when a life is to be &s;aved by it&mdash; although a lady or gentleman may have ever &s;o good a &s;pirit, to be &s;ure, upon &s;uch con&s;iderati|ons, they mu&s;t give way; according to Sir John Fal&s;taff's aphori&s;m,</P>
<Q>Honour mu&s;t be hid in nece&s;&s;ity.</Q>
<P>While Mr. David was putting him&s;elf once more into chair-carrying exerci&s;e, &s;ome &s;oldiers were ordered to be quartered in his neighbour|hood;
<PB N="34" REF="45">and Corporal Knott brought a billet for him&s;elf, to Mrs. Llwhyddwhuydd's</P>
<P>The Corporal was a gentleman remarkable for his gallantry; he had had as many fine wo|man as any general officer; he was form'd for intrigue, and graced with every accompli&s;hment which could undo the fair.</P>
<P>He &s;ung all the &s;ongs in the Beggars Opera, he could &s;peak ten Tragedy love &s;peeches, could dance a hornpipe, &s;hew tricks with cards, balance a lady's fan upon his no&s;e, no gentleman could fill a tea-pot more gracefully, or &s;wear more often, or more agreeably: then he wore his hat &s;o &s;martly bluff, and his hair was powdered &s;o &s;mooth, could he have been but as con&s;tant as he was lovely. Yet as no man is perfect, he affected to imitate his betters, and boa&s;t of his amours.</P>
<P>It is natural for one hero to take another for his pattern; he cho&s;e Alexander the Great for his; it was the Macedonians frailty to glory too much in his conque&s;ts; which Arrian could no more excu&s;e in the &s;on of Philip, than I can in Corporal Knott.</P>
<P>He, though admired by the fair, was di&s;liked by his brother &s;ubalterns, e&s;pecially the veterans, who, hagged by winter campaigns, their faces weather-worn, and &s;carified; did not like to &s;ee him look &s;o plump, &s;o pert, &s;o &s;mooth|faced, and wear his linnen &s;o well ironed; when they, who had endured all the inclemency of every hard &s;ea&s;on, in the tented and untented fields of unho&s;pitable Germany; who reflected, that, at the time they were thus fighting their country's battles, in&s;tead of wearing nice plaited linnen, had not any linnen to plait; and half a
<PB N="35" REF="46">dozen brave Briti&s;h battallion boys, who &s;corned to turn their backs upon double the number of French fellows, though all beruffled and chit|terlin'd, yet all <HI>their</HI> linnen, would not &s;et up a tinder merchant.</P>
<P>They &s;narled at this beau Corporal; &s;wear|ing he was not fit for any &s;ervice, but ju&s;t to make one in an officer's guard, at the Opera-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Often have I heard the&s;e non-commi&s;&s;ioned heroes, as they have limped along&mdash;that de|fect in their gait proceeding, either from the wounds received in battle; or from the neglect of not being dre&s;&s;ed after the fight; or from in|curable contractions, or relaxations, the fatal ef|fects of being expo&s;ed to the &s;corching heats, and &s;udden damps of Africa, and America; and to the &s;everity of wintering in ill-provided quar|ters, on the banks of the Rhine, the Wee&s;er, the Lippe, &amp;c. &amp;c. for which, perhaps, Fle|mi&s;h and Dutch commi&s;&s;aries, * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * I was pre&s;ent at the di&s;putation, which old <HI>Winterne&s;s</HI> had with Corporal <HI>Knott</HI> on this &s;ubject; which, with the reader's leave, we'll in&s;ert &mdash; becau&s;e, if it is not a &s;tory, it is a dialogue; and as it is a dialogue, it will be a means of di&s;playing a copper-plate exhi|bition of an old warrior, and a junior fine gen|tleman; or, more properly, to explain the print; it is a contra&s;t between the <HI>Charms</HI> of <HI>Peace</HI> in Mr. Knott's figure, and the <HI>Fortune</HI> of <HI>War</HI> in the old &s;oldier's portrait.</P>
<P>At the valiant tooper the altercation happen|ed; old Winterne&s;s was relating in the Corpo|ral's
<PB N="36" REF="47">company all the engagements he had been in; fighting all his battles o'er and o'er again, and marking with a &s;tick, upon the &s;and of the ale-hou&s;e kitchen, the marches and counter|marches of our armies, dwelling with empha&s;is on the &s;pot where he had received a &s;hot, or lo&s;t a limb.&mdash;There, my boys, ju&s;t there, where I put my foot now, there I &s;tood on the left of the Scotch greys, and had the&s;e two cuts on my &s;kull, and, as it mought be here, I had the&s;e three wounds; and &s;uppo&s;ing now the&s;e pieces of pipe to be our front line, as I was to the right of the royal, a mu&s;quet ball took me in flank, and went through both my thighs, and there Sir, as I was running after the French Pollavou&s;ees, I lo&s;t the u&s;e of my right eye; and, Sir, &s;uppo&s;ing this full-pot now to be Bocachica ca&s;tle, there I &s;tood while we were attacking it; and here it was, that I left my arm and leg at Cartagenah. &mdash; But what then &mdash; I don't think much at it, not I &mdash;I have gained honour and glory enough for an hone&s;t man&mdash;I know what it is to &s;erve my country &mdash; and &s;o here's his Maje&s;ty King George's health, and all his family, and Old England for ever&mdash;and as to my limbs, why they're welcome to um, as welcome as I am to this tobacco of my own buying.</P>
<P>This limb-lo&s;ing conver&s;ation was foreign to the Corporal's thoughts; he had been bred up in polite and delicate principles, which was di|ametrically oppo&s;ite to &s;uch gothic cu&s;toms; al|though &s;everal people of birth lately, have been mad enough to relap&s;e into their forefathers ru&s;ticity, and not mind the &s;un's &s;poiling their complexions, nor different climates having any

<P>Yet he was ready, with a &s;mall &s;word, to give any private gentleman &s;atisfaction&mdash;be|cau&s;e that was fighting upon honour, which no per&s;on of honour could refu&s;e&mdash;but fighting for one's country may be refu&s;ed; becau&s;e you may have&mdash;or&mdash;or&mdash;or&mdash;or&mdash;or&mdash;&amp;c. &amp;c. Knott, unwilling that <HI>Old Chel&s;ea</HI> &s;hould win all the applau&s;e of the company, interrupted the &s;car-furrowed gre|nadier; ob&s;erving, that a man might run as many ri&s;ques, be in as many dangers at home, as abroad; and to prove it, related his intrigues with &s;everal fine women.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, he recounted the hair breadth &s;capes to get <HI>Mi&s;s Neatsfoot,</HI> the tripe-man's daughter off &mdash;how he &s;caled the back garret, how he knock|ed down the watchman, and how the town was obliged to him for bringing &s;o accompli&s;hed a girl upon it&mdash;thus the Corporal went on. &mdash; It was I that gave that girl the fir&s;t idea of acting. <HI>I u&s;t to tell her,</HI> how the fir&s;t time &s;he got into grand keeping, &s;he mu&s;t per&s;uade her friend to &s;peak to &s;ome of the managers, about letting her come upon the Stage; becau&s;e I know that's common &mdash; ay, and it's grown a &s;cheme too among &s;everal gentlemen about town, to get
<PB N="38" REF="50">rid of their women that way; for when a girl grows &s;tale upon their hands, and they want to part with her genteely, without being a &s;ettlement out of pocket by her; why then the&s;e gentle|men, will call on one or other of the ma|nagers, and &s;o, in a &s;ort of half-a&s;king favour|way, they will tell the proprietor, that there is a fine woman of their acquaintance, who they know will be of &s;ervice in the Play-hou&s;e; and taking the patentee by the hand, the'll &s;ay&mdash; come &s;et the girl down in the li&s;t, pon honner I &s;hall take it immen&s;ely kind, I know you won't refu&s;e me, what's forty or fifty &s;hillings a week out of your pocket; be&s;ides, I am &s;ure &s;he'll earn it. And this is the way that we have women of the town belonging to the Theatres.</P>
<P>Then, continued the Corporal, there was <HI>Bett Filbert,</HI> &s;he was the be&s;t dre&s;t fruit girl a|bout St. James's market&mdash;I beat the reform|ing ra&s;cals for her &mdash; no woman of quality, though &s;he had ever &s;o fine a &s;ilk &s;tocking, and diamond &s;hoe-buckle on, could &s;how a neater leg and foot then Bett's was, with her &s;ilver cla&s;ps, red clocks, and pinned up petticoats; and as to an elegant and polite manner of doing things; who ever opened oy&s;ters with more affa|bility then Bett? or made a hot-pot with more ta&s;te then &s;he did?</P>
<P>Then there was <HI>Wa&s;te Butt,</HI> the publican's widow, I &s;pent about five and forty pounds of her money, only &s;he grew too fond; and when once a woman begins to behave &s;o its ful&s;ome, and what no man of true delicacy can bear; I was obliged, therefore, to leave her, and got <HI>cherry-cheeked Judy,</HI> that u&s;ed to li&s;p at Bucking|ham-gate, <HI>can o'milk, Sir?</HI>&mdash;I was private then,

<P>Why then, Sir, I mu&s;t tell you&mdash;that a man of honour, Sir &mdash; &s;triking his fi&s;t at the &s;ame time again&s;t his wai&s;tcoat brea&s;t buttons, a man of honour, Sir, would as &s;oon &s;ell his king as his mi&s;tre&s;s. &mdash; A &s;oldier, let me tell you, Sir, would as &s;oon de&s;ert from his po&s;t, or run away from his colours, as give his girl up &mdash; I have been among the beauties in my time, Sir&mdash;but before I would &s;urrender my wo|man to a general officer's &s;ummons, I'd be drummed out of the regiment for cowardice; and as to advancement, I have got Chel&s;ea hone&s;tly &mdash; I never won preferment by pimping.</P>

<P>This di&s;pute would certainly have grown &s;e|rious, had not the Editor of this work &s;tarted up between them&mdash;whi&s;pered Knott, that he &s;aw a fine girl pa&s;s by the &s;a&s;h window, and give the Corporal a beckon; away &s;kipped Knott, and I begg'd old Winterne&s;s to be pacified; and that I would bring him half a pound of the be&s;t pigtail next &s;unday.</P>
<P>This plea&s;ed the veteran, he &s;hook the Editor heartily by the hand, promi&s;ed him never to mind any more fools for the future; &s;wore, when he dyed he would leave me all his papers, if I
<PB N="40" REF="52">would promi&s;e him to write the hi&s;tory of an old &s;oldier.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary we &s;hould return to the other per&s;onages of our dramatical copper-plate hi&s;to|ry; and con&s;ider to what purpo&s;e Corporal Knott was introduced into this narration; with regret I record it, but Madam Llwhyddwhuydd, for all her re&s;olutions, fell in love with him.</P>
<P>Sometimes a lady's vows, like French treaties, are not to be relied on&mdash;they are like ha&s;ty made acts of parliament, which the cunning of conv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">niency can always find means to evade. &mdash;Be&s;ides, when love is in the ca&s;e; nay, when money, for love and money are like a principle in mechanics, which acts equal and contrary. Love is equal in its power of action to money, but contrary in its effects; for as money will make per&s;ons blind to every thing, but their own intere&s;t; love will make per&s;ons &s;ee every thing, but their own intere&s;t. And with this mechanical, metaphy&s;ical, tritical, critical, and analytical di&s;qui&s;ition, proper it is to fini&s;h this &s;cene of the drama.</P>

<P>There is &s;omewhat va&s;tly &s;ignificant, not only in the reputation of being a &s;oldier, but al&s;o in a &s;oldier's reputation; which made Madam Llwhyddwhuydd, as &s;oon as ever the Corporal came with his billet to her hou&s;e, regard him with an eye of complacency.</P>
<P>But when &s;he heard what a number of wo|men he had ruined, &s;he could not take her eyes from him, not being able to imagine what he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;o extraordinary, that made &s;o many

<PB N="41" REF="54">ladies fall in love with him&mdash;and as we know curio&s;ity has as &s;udden and violent effect upon the frame of a fine woman, as an hy&s;teric; &s;he determined to be &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>The Corporal conceived a mo&s;t violent incli|nation for her, from the moment he was con|vinced her hu&s;band was a monied man, and that &s;he bore the pur&s;e.</P>
<P>He immediately opened his trenches with a love &s;peech, made regular approaches, by &s;queezing her hand; planted his battery of ogles again&s;t her; and quickly found he had a friend in the garri&s;on, which determined him to make one general a&s;&s;ault, by a billet doux, that he re|&s;olved &s;hould be in the mo&s;t elegant manner; and concluded to have a &s;ong wrote upon her.</P>
<P>He enquired among the Choice Spirits, who then held their meetings, like the primitive chri&s;tians, by &s;tealth, the reforming con&s;tables carrying on terrible pro&s;ecutions again&s;t them; he found them at the cat and bagpipe, in Ro&s;emary-lane, after declaring, upon honour, he was no informer; and owning his bu&s;ine&s;s; he was inducted to the pre&s;ident, whom you &s;ee in the print, one George Alexander Stevens, and who was recommended to the Corporal as a &s;ong-writer.</P>
<P>Stevens received &s;ix-pence from him as earn|e&s;t; for it was a rule, which the poets of that club had made, to always have half the money down; and the pre&s;ident declared he would write the &s;ong, as &s;oon as ever the di&s;putation was over, which the gentleman's entrance had put a &s;top to.</P>
<P>The argument was warmly &s;upported by the two altercators, Stevens and Harry Howard the
<PB N="42" REF="55">a&s;s-man, concerning e&s;&s;ential qualities. George in&s;i&s;ted, the only acqui&s;itions, which could con|&s;titute human happine&s;s, were temperance, &s;ta|bility, and propriety of behaviour.&mdash;Harry, on the contrary, &s;wore, that there were no ac|compli&s;hments worth a man's while to be ma&s;ter of, except good breeding, and a good educati|on. This di&s;pute would have la&s;ted much longer, had not a headborough opened the door, and producing a warrant again&s;t Harry Howard for &s;currility, took away one &s;ide of the argu|ment.</P>
<P>A &s;heriff's officer would have carried off the other, he came there with a thief-take's dog fearful of a re&s;cue&mdash;but lea&s;t the thread of our hi&s;tory &s;hould be &s;napped too &s;oon, we &s;hall turn over this cau&s;e and arre&s;t, to the chapter entitled the art of bail-taking, or&mdash;the&mdash;by&mdash;London&mdash;and We&s;tmin&s;ter.</P>

<P><PB N="43" REF="56">What then could a &s;ong-maker do with Llwhyddwhuydd? had he not cunningly &s;up|plied that defect, by ver&s;ifying her Creolian name Chloe; and fitted up &s;o ta&s;ty a love-&s;ong for the Corporal, that Mr. Knott, taking the bard by the hand, &s;wore, had he had any more money about him to &s;ignify, he would have made George a hand&s;ome pre&s;ent, over and above what he agreed with him for; however, the military man's &s;pirit was &s;o great, and he was &s;o well plea&s;ed with the ver&s;es, that he &s;lipped the re|maining change of &s;ix-pence into the poet's hand, which was all Knott had, after paying for a tankard of porter, the entrance fee, which every body &s;ub&s;cribed, according to the rules of the room, before they could be admitted ho|norary members.</P>
<P>The Editor of this undertaking cannot be &s;o ingrateful, as to &s;uffer &s;uch a noble action of the Corporal's to &s;lip, without taking proper notice of it.</P>
<P><HI>To the</HI> mo&s;t Noble, mo&s;t Worthy, mo&s;t &mdash; <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Ye great men of many manors, who at this pre&s;ent writing can chu&s;e your taverns, and pay a ready money reckoning for every dainty you call for; while I, twirling my mutton before an ill-&s;upplied fire, am &s;tretching the ela&s;ticity of my invention, to its utmo&s;t pitch, how to ob|tain, upon credit, one &s;ingle beer and beer libati|on.&mdash;Oh, would ye but imitate this generous &s;oldier's behaviour, and be&s;tow upon the arti&s;ts, you employ, a premium for their merit. But arti&s;ts, perhaps, would think them&s;elves happy,
<PB N="44" REF="57">could they, in&s;tead of being paid overplus, only receive the prices they agreed for.</P>
<P>But laments are vain, the labourers of genius, and the lollers in a coach and &s;ix, are no more analogous, than politics and plain-dealing.</P>
<P>Hone&s;tly and <HI>bona &s;ide</HI> I &s;peak; if they do call me names, I can't help it; but &frac58; of all the rich people in England, were it not for their money, would have no more &s;en&s;e, no more wit, no more ta&s;te, no more genero&s;ity, no more hu|manity, no more learning, no more affability, nor more of any more, mores, than we have, who are obliged to mind our books, to make the pot boil.</P>
<P>Yet writers, who pretend to &s;atyri&s;e rich folks, are to blame; nor &s;hould any pen and ink dealers call the expectants and dependants of wealthy men, who are known by the name of toad-eaters, to an account for their behaviour.</P>
<P>To be &s;ure, the members of the toad-eating club will give his honour va&s;t applau&s;e, if his honour &s;ays but any thing bordering upon com|mon &s;en&s;e; and they will al&s;o lift up their hands and eyes, with theatrical a&s;toni&s;hment, if her lady&s;hip &s;hould make an ob&s;ervation pertinent to the &s;ubject, and extol the va&s;tne&s;s of their pa|tron's capacities. Now I cannot &s;ee any flat|tery in all this; for it is wonderful, con&s;idering rich peoples education. The ductility of their tutors, the venality of their menials, and the libertini&s;ms they are indulged in; how they can ever &s;ay, think, or do any thing, to the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Heirs to great fortunes are born as well mind|ed, very often, as the poore&s;t tenant's child un|der them; but the under&s;tanding of the elde&s;t
<PB N="45" REF="58">hope of great families, is either totally neglect|ed, or el&s;e cultivated in an improper manner.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on why men of genius are &s;o &s;eldom rewarded by men of fortune, is, becau&s;e men of fortune don't under&s;tand genius; therefore rich people are more proper objects for pity than &s;atire. It is the want of having their minds ju&s;tly improved by arts and &s;ciences, which makes them &s;uch &s;trangers, to the happine&s;s of know|ing what to do with their time.</P>
<P>To be a man of fa&s;hion, they think, is the excellence of perfection; or they would not la|vi&s;h &s;uch va&s;t &s;ums for the encouragement of grooms, gamblers, pro&s;titutes and rare-&s;hows; when &s;o many works of public utility become abortive, and &s;o many arti&s;ts pine away for want of the hand of bounty, to bring them to life, for the &s;ervice of their country.</P>
<P>Is it not a &s;hame, that in &s;o noble a nation as England, renowned throughout the world for arts and arms, the major part of tho&s;e, who &s;hould &s;et a better example, only exhau&s;t them|&s;elves and their fortunes, in an eternal round of vi&s;its, cards, auctions, foreign fidlers, and ballad-&s;ingers.</P>
<P>As to ballad-&s;ingers and ballad-makers, the difference is trifling in regard of their merit; but the reward is not proportionable. This Stevens, to my knowledge, has wrote upwards of 200 &s;ongs, yet never was &s;o well paid for any; nay, for all the re&s;t, as for that one he made the Corporal.</P>

<P>Home ha&s;ted the Corporal with the copy of ver&s;es, and gave them the lady wrapped up, as he received them from the author. She hurried into her own room with the pacquet, imagining it was &s;ome very pretty pre&s;ent; but when it was unwafered, and it appeared to be only a paper filled with written hand, which &s;he could not read one &s;yllable, Mrs. Llwhyddwhuydd &s;uffered the mo&s;t cruel agitation of &s;pirits, that ever any lady was thrown into; who, by the &s;udden whim of &s;pou&s;e or papa, was prevented from being punctual to the moment of a&s;&s;igna|tion.</P>
<P>She &s;uppo&s;ed the letter to be an appoint|ment, the Corporal gone to the rendevouz, and had left her that, as a direction where to follow him. How did &s;he then lament her not being book-learned; &s;he fretted, &s;ighed, &s;tamp|ed,
<PB N="54" REF="67">called on her &s;tars, on the Corporal, and fate.</P>
<P>The maid, pa&s;&s;ing by the door, heard the outcry, run down to Mr. Knott, beckon|ing him into the back kitchen, a&s;ked him what he had done to her mi&s;tre&s;s; for that, as how her mi&s;tre&s;s was in the mo&s;t wonderful con&s;ter|nation, about the Corporal, and what he had wrote in a paper.</P>
<P>Knott, who had been, Bajazet like, enjoy|ing, though but in fancy, his &s;cheme, and what an opinion his landlady mu&s;t have of him, and how fine a fellow &s;he mu&s;t think him; to be able to write &s;o fine a &s;ong, was &s;truck as flat, with what the girl &s;aid to him, as a new actor ju&s;t hi&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>It occured to him, on the in&s;tant that the ver&s;e-maker had hummed him; and, in&s;tead of the &s;ong he had paid for, had palmed &s;ome other paper, on purpo&s;e to make the lover look like a fool; and Knott muttered, <HI>damm the&s;e wits, they are always full of mi&s;chief, e&s;pecially again&s;t their be&s;t friends; however, I'll break the ra&s;cal's bones.</HI></P>
<P>Unluckily for &s;ome parties, George, the bal|lad-compiler, then was pa&s;&s;ing along on the other &s;ide of the way, the military man had a view of him, and through the entry Knott bur&s;t into the &s;treet after the &s;cribbler.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ion or anger will as effectually dazzle per&s;ons eyes as intere&s;t. Mr. Knott, by rage, was &s;o dim-&s;ighted, that, as he &s;prung from the thre&s;hold, he &s;aw not a &s;edan, which David and his partner were bearing by with a fair in it.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="68">Again&s;t its &s;ide ru&s;hed the Corporal, and down came the chair, &s;hattering upon the pave|ment. The gla&s;&s;es were &s;ma&s;hed, the &s;a&s;h frames &s;hivered; and the &s;oldier tumbling over the top of it, rowled into the channel, calling out, as he lay, <HI>oh, Stevens, I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll do for you.</HI></P>
<P>George Alexander, hearing a threatning voice, imagining it to be a bailiff's, &s;tarted off, fa&s;t as fear could wing his feet; and (like an expe|ditious fine porter, running to his duty) over&s;et every one who &s;tood in his way.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t per&s;on, who fell a victim to the ve|locity of the poet's fears, was <HI>Well-fleet Betty,</HI> &s;tanding on the upper &s;tep of a cook's cellar, with a ba&s;ket full of goods upon her head; one hand was re&s;ted upon her hip, her elbow form|ing the point of an angle, and with the fingers and thumb of the other hand, &s;he was &s;napping defiance.</P>
<P>The bard took her in flank, ru&s;hing again&s;t her out&s;tanding elbow; the &s;udden &s;hock turn|ed her half round, and backwards &s;he pitched into the cellar, ju&s;t as Theo. Cibber's property|man was bringing up twelve-pennyworth of &s;oup and ox-cheek <HI>bouilli,</HI> for his ma&s;ter come|dian's dinner.</P>
<P>Down &s;ou&s;ed Bet&s;y's head into the di&s;h, and her feet fell on each &s;ide of the young man's head, upon his &s;houlders; her weight returned him into the cellar; and the broken baking pan, the ox-cheek, the &s;oup, and the oy&s;ters, cover|ed the floor.</P>
<P>Onward &s;campered George, overturning Had|dock's waiter, who had a box full of jellies in his hands; then the &s;ong &s;cribbler met parrellel to his brea&s;t a mop-handle, which a wench was
<PB N="56" REF="69">twirling; his force flung it in a diagonal direc|tion down; but the mop hit in its way the &s;ilk|&s;tockin'd &s;hins of a French dancing-ma&s;ter the blow brought <HI>Mon&s;ieur Capriole</HI> to the ground, he pitched upon his face, and his no&s;e was flat|tened again&s;t the pavement.</P>
<P>The perpetrator of this mi&s;chief began to be &s;cant of breath; and turning his head, as he ran, to &s;ee where his pur&s;uers were, he threw down a &s;alop &s;tall.</P>
<P>The vender of that diet drink, had ju&s;t &s;erved a di&s;h to no le&s;s a chapman, than the little poet DERRICK, <HI>the doer of Dryden's works,</HI> who, not thinking of any thing, was very innocently cooling his &s;a&s;&s;afras, when the gro&s;s bodied bard, like a collier, running foul of a plea&s;ure boat, tumbled the &s;mall &s;ized ver&s;ifier into the dirt.</P>
<P>The bulk of Mr. Derrick's muff, prevented him from being brui&s;ed; but the blade of his pinch-beck hilted rapier, &s;napped in the &s;cabbard, and the &s;pray of the &s;alop, obliged the little gentleman to keep his bed, until the &s;cowerer had repaired the damage his laced coat and wai&s;t|coat had &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P>Here the race ended; the author of all the&s;e ills, tumbling at the &s;ame time, was &s;eized by the woman, to pay for what was broke, &s;poiled and &s;pilt.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay, what might have been the event of George's being detained, &s;ince he always was inflicted, with that terrible malady, of <HI>non &s;um &s;olvendum;</HI> but Mr. MACKLIN the the actor came by, paid the co&s;t, and took Ste|vens home, promoting him to be his tutor.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> COUCH SCENE.</HEAD>
<P>The per&s;on who happened to be in the chair, when it was overturned, was the very drole SAM.

<P>He had not, at this time, exhibited publickly any of his extraordinaries; neither was he as yet determined, to what part of the arts and &s;ci|ences he &s;hould devote him&s;elf.</P>
<P>It was to this adventure, and the advice of Mi&s;s Shred, that the town has had the happine&s;s of being entertained with his <HI>Vis Oeuvres.</HI></P>

<P>Mi&s;s Shred in&s;i&s;ted, upon carrying up the ba|&s;on of water, and towel, to the gentleman. Mr. Foot received her with all that complai|&s;ance, peculiar to him&s;elf; and a&s;&s;ured her, both

<P>Sir, a per&s;on of your appearance demands the mo&s;t polite reception; and, as I am con&s;cious, the people of this hou&s;e, are too vulgar to u&s;e &s;uch a per&s;on, as you are, as you &s;hould be; therefore I left my own hou&s;e, that I might pay a proper regard to one of your elegant ap|pearance.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> FOOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, you do me too much honour; to be &s;ure ma'am, I conceive the inhabitants of this porter-&s;elling territory, to be the quinte&s;&s;ence of vulgarity. My Ideas never before announc|ed &s;uch a contemptible &s;et of reptiles, as tho&s;e creatures were, who helped me out of the chair: one &s;hould not, they &s;ay, mock one's friends; but upon my &s;oul, they were &s;uch a collection of grote&s;ques, that while they were doing me a great piece of &s;ervice, I could not help taking them off; and the fellow who &s;eemed to have the mo&s;t humanity about him, and was really very tender of me, &s;quinted his compa&s;&s;ion with two &s;uch inverted eyes, &s;aying&mdash;<HI>I hope your honour cant hurt, Sir.</HI></P>

<PB N="59" REF="73">of the polite&s;t per&s;ons; and which, Sir, you mu&s;t know, and if you was not to do it, Sir, it would be a lo&s;s to the world; for you know, Sir, each individual admires to have an acquaintance, nay, all their acquaintance, made ridiculous; and I am per&s;uaded, no per&s;on, can be more happy in that execution, than your&s;elf.</P>

</SP>
<P>This it was, on which Mr. Foot laid the foundation of that grandeur, we have &s;everal times &s;een him &s;o amazingly arrive at. To
<PB N="61" REF="75">Mi&s;s Shred he was obliged, for the hint of giv|ing tea; by her he al&s;o was initiated into that &s;pecies of wit and humour, with which, to this day, he continues, with &s;o much originality, to entertain the town.</P>
<P>During this above-&s;tairs conver&s;ation, David was bu&s;ied, in picking up his chair's fragments; the Corporal was upon foot pur&s;uing the au|thor; but the &s;oldier met his officer at the turn of a &s;treet, who ordered him immediately to get ready, and &s;et out next morning for Corn|wall.</P>
<P>Knott, though he was alarmed at the com|mand, knew his duty was to be &s;ilent, and obey.&mdash;But took his re&s;olutions accordingly; as he had been hitherto &s;ucce&s;sful in his &s;chemes, with the fair &s;ex, and that his time was &s;o &s;hort, he went upon the hunt, for two of his com|rades he could confide in.</P>
<P>This was the rea&s;on, that Madam Llwhydd|whydd did not &s;ee her lover all that day; although its certain, no lady ever more longed, that is, &s;he wanted to be &s;atisfied, and no per&s;on, &s;he was &s;ure, or at lea&s;t &s;he thought her&s;elf &s;ure, and that fancy with many ladies, amounts to a certainty, that no body could &s;atisfy her, &s;o well, as the Corporal.</P>
<P>The damaged chair was &s;ent to be repaired; Mr. Foot and his lady took coach for a coun|try jaunt. David, having nothing el&s;e to exe|ci&s;e him&s;elf with, re&s;olved to walk into Wap|ping, to &s;ee his brother on board of &s;hip.</P>
<P>His &s;pou&s;e, who knew her hu&s;band would not be at home, until four or five in the morning, began to be va&s;tly unea&s;y about the Corporal, who made it evening before he returned.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="76">The gue&s;ts withdrawn, the maid hurried to bed; ju&s;t as the feeble watchman, whi&s;tling in his &s;ound, came by coughing out, pa-a-aa&s;t 11 o'clock&mdash;Mr. Knott, high in blood, &s;tole (like Lothario) unheeded to his dear Llwhydd|whuydd's chamber, he found the lady <HI>loo&s;e, unattir|ed, warm,</HI>&mdash;I a&s;hamed to &s;ay it&mdash;but <HI>fuddled,</HI> ab&s;olutely <HI>non compos;</HI> how it happened, as well as &s;o melancholy an accident can bear relating, &s;hall be di&s;clo&s;ed.</P>
<P>That night the lady went up &s;tairs, in charm|ing &s;pirits. Mr. Knott having received the wink of a&s;&s;ignation, while he &s;at below, drinking with his comrades. But ala&s;s, unhappy gentlewoman, reflecting perhaps too much, on what might very naturally happen, between her, and the Corporal; &s;he grew immoderately thir&s;ty, in poetry we &s;hould expre&s;s it, <HI>&s;he was burning with de&s;ire.</HI></P>
<P>By mi&s;take &s;he put a bottle of brandy to her mouth, which had, in the hurry, been put un|corked where the water-bottle u&s;ed to &s;tand. It was there placed by the maid, the mi&s;tre&s;s's &s;ud|den coming up, prevented the girl from any other ways di&s;po&s;ing it.</P>
<P>Mrs. Llwhyddwhuydd's agitation of mind, rendered her incapable of judging the differ|ence, until &s;he had &s;wallowed &s;o large a gulph; intoxication was the con&s;equence. By which the reader is deprived of one of tho&s;e lu&s;cious de&s;criptions, which are now looked upon in the novel way, the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential embelli&s;hments for modern book&s;elling.</P>
<P>Yet not to have our cu&s;tomers entirely di&s;|appointed, we pre&s;ent them with the lady a&s;leep, in one of tho&s;e engaging attitudes, &s;o enticing,

<P>Elderly lovers have out-lived their's, there|fore both mu&s;t be alike fed, and their &s;trength|le&s;s appetites, tempted by in&s;ub&s;tantial garni&s;h; not having power to reli&s;h manly food.</P>
<P>Mr. Knott, knowing by the orders he had received from the captain, there was no time to &s;pare, took &s;ome pains to waken the lady; and having recovered her &s;o well, as to acknowledge &s;he loved no man like the Corporal, he di&s;cover|ed to her how he was pinched for time; the lady, fearing to lo&s;e her &s;o very lately gained lover; the force of liquor, and power of the Corporal's arguments, altogether corre&s;ponding, made her con&s;ent that very night to go off with him. The maid fa&s;t a&s;leep in the garret, the drawer dead drunk in the cellar, and her hu&s;|band from home. She packed up all the plate, ready money, and her be&s;t cloaths; for that is an ob&s;ervation I have generally made, that la|dies, who, by &s;tealth, leave their hu&s;bands, are determined that the lo&s;s &s;hall be as &s;everely felt, as the time they have to accompli&s;h their &s;cheme will admit.</P>
<P>It was by the help of Mr. Knott's comrades, every article was brought &s;afe to the Fly; in which the Corporal and his lady were convey|ed, without one accident to Port&s;mouth; there the next morning, by the greate&s;t good luck, they found a &s;loop going off for Plymouth, in
<PB N="64" REF="79">which they embarked, and in four days landed there, then by ea&s;y journeys reached Cornwal; to which the Corporal's rout was directed.</P>
<P>Since we have conducted Mrs. Llwhydd|whuydd &s;o far, we'll let her re&s;t a little after her journey, and take a trip to London, to inquire what became of her hu&s;band.</P>

<P>But when all the pia and dura mater apart|ments are filled, and not a &s;ingle idea, even for the good of &s;elf, can be wedged in, there will remain great quantities of this windy effluvia, which the owner of the head has imbibed in the la&s;t day and night's exerci&s;e, which mu&s;t be di&s;|charged, charged, before the proper di&s;po&s;ed imaginations can have room to act.</P>

<P>After David had &s;lept about five hours, loud and &s;ound, the ela&s;tic coats of his brain began to exert their pul&s;ations, and he dreamed a dream which forboded mi&s;chief, as plain as any dream, ever repeated at breakfa&s;t, by the polit|e&s;t, prettie&s;t, and mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible maid, wife, wi|dow or mi&s;tre&s;s, you enjoyed a morning's t&ecirc;te a t&ecirc;te with, or at lea&s;t, that you &s;aid you did.</P>
<P>David did dream, as how, that the Tower of London was made of papier mach&eacute;e; and that the French intended to undermine all our coal|pits, and &s;o de&s;troy the nur&s;ery of our &s;eamen.</P>
<P>Out of the &s;even or eight millions of Great Britain's inhabitants, one million we may rea|&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e will read this book; and that 900,000 of tho&s;e readers, delight in the inter|pretation of dreams; for their emolument, we &s;hall explain this dream, viz.

<P>Furthermore, it is &s;aid in this Book, chap. 20, page 99. I wi&s;h, may it plea&s;e your ho|nour, that you would either look a little more into it, or &s;uffer your elde&s;t &s;on, to be a little better acquainted with it; and I would bett a good name again&s;t great riches, and that's ten pounds to a crown, you know; that if tho&s;e per&s;onages, who can read it, would &s;tudy it, not thumb and dog's ear a drole place or two; but go fairly, and hone&s;tly through it; they would be taught, to think wor&s;e of them&s;elves, than they do at pre&s;ent; and thereby become better for the future.</P>
<P>There would every egoti&s;t di&s;cover, <Q>That his con&s;equence was but conceit, and judg|ment merely opinion. That FLATTERY is the univer&s;al language. KNAVERY man|kind's modus. Conver&s;ation quibbling. PUB|LIC SPIRIT a riddle. FRIENSHIP a phan|tom; and SELF-INTEREST, grand &s;ignior.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Good-breeding may be contaminated; and greatne&s;s put in an extreme fury, for &s;uch trifling things, as an hone&s;t chairman, would be a&s;hamed to be out of temper about.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And when the mo&s;t polite are mo&s;t angrily agitated, they may, and do often, &s;wear, huff, kick, cur&s;e, &s;trike, abu&s;e, break, and bellow, with &s;uch violence, as if they were no more than a chairman; or any other &s;uch illiberal beings. And I beg leave to ob&s;erve, (for all what the heralds office alledge to the contrary) even her grace, although deli|cately dignified, may be horridly chagrin'd, if
<PB N="69" REF="84">&s;he permits pa&s;&s;ion to gallop over the cour&s;e with her.</Q></P>
<P>The unfortunate Mr. Llwhyddwhuydd, pre|&s;ently &s;wore him&s;elf out of breath, in hurrying backwards, and forwards, throughout the neigh|bourhood, to tell his &s;ad &s;tory. Vowed many ra&s;h vows, and &s;aid many bad things. When his friends found his anger, was obliged, for want of fre&s;h &s;pirits, to &s;ub&s;ide; and he was &s;ufficiently relaxed, to hear con&s;olation, they admini&s;tered advice <HI>gratis.</HI> As all Engli&s;h peo|ple ought to do, one among another; the gene|rality of my countrymen and women, are apt enough to be&s;tow their coun&s;els, even una&s;ked, in all ca&s;es,&mdash;none but phy&s;icians and law|yers making money of their words.</P>
<P>They &s;ell their advice, as Lapland witches do wind, only to make more mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>His partner, begged him to be comforted; &s;queezing Mr. Llwhyddwhydd by the brawny part of his thumb; my dear David, don't hurt your&s;elf any more, by grief. I don't doubt, but all will be well as ever; and your &s;pou&s;e &s;hall come home again; and there will be no harm done; and you will live hapyy, to the end of your days; and you mu&s;t take example by your betters, and forget, and forgive, as the Bible &s;ays.</P>
<P>This &s;peech, gave David great cau&s;e of con|templation; and after he was in bed that night, thus he &s;oliloqui&s;ed.</P>
<P>In the name of God, and St. David, can I ever, in honour, have my wife home again? Am I not an ancient Briton? Where then mu&s;t I put my honour? Is not my honour, the &s;eat of my heart? and has &s;he not given away her

<P>Not being able to &s;leep, he went to his li|brary; and looking over the index of his ma|gazines, among tho&s;e curious receptacles of the atoms of univer&s;al learning, he found the fol|lowing e&s;&s;ay, concerning</P>

<P><PB N="71" REF="86">The Turks, cannot be &s;uch civili&s;ed per|&s;ons, as chri&s;tians. Therefore have no idea of honour; and are &s;trangers to duelling; that cu&s;tom of killing, is only practi&s;ed where the go&s;pel is taught.</P>
<P>However, the mahometans have great hone&s;ty, in re&s;pect of their meum and tuum dealings. But that method of merchandiz|ing, is no more than an ab&s;olute &s;entiment, which might do well enough for the moral law, but the &s;tatutes, and practices of the European courts, being by revealed religi|on more enlightened; &s;uch infidels as Turks and heathens, by not having the advan|tages we chri&s;tians have, can never act &s;o upright as we do.</P>
<P>Laws, honour, equity, and hone&s;ty, be|ing refined, are to be con&s;idered&mdash;but we refer the reader, for a proper explication of tho&s;e matters, to our notes, upon the Atha|na&s;ian creed.</P>
<P>In Italy, Spain, and Portugal, the na|tives are extremely tenacious of their honour; as they are al&s;o of their religion; the two mo&s;t noble practices of the &s;oul.</P>
<P>They are per&s;ons of &s;uperior honour, and religion, to the re&s;t of Chri&s;tendom; which accounts, why &s;o many people are poi&s;on|ed, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, and put into the inqui&s;ition, in tho&s;e countries, more than any others.

<P>The French, are not much bigotted to ma|trimonial honour; but they have very ro|mantic ideas of glory, and imagine, that

<P>Nay, &s;o prone are our Engli&s;h people, to follow French fa&s;hions, that we have adopt|ed this mode; and &s;uch is the common cha|racteri&s;tic of our country, to improve upon every invention, that a great many of our Britons have carried this glory much farther than ever the French dared; they had a very fair trial for it lately; and, in &s;pite of pol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ti|cal jockey&s;hip; and though we were obliged &s;ometimes to &s;hift &s;addles, and &s;ometimes we could not go as we would; yet we always came in for the &s;weep-&s;takes.</P></Q>

<P>This was not &s;atisfactory to Mr. Llwhydd|whuydd; he did not under&s;tand any thing about glory; all his care was about his honour, and not meeting with an explanatory account, in any of his volumes, he aro&s;e next morning, to con&s;ult an old acquaintance, and country woman of his, and one of the wi&s;e&s;t people ever born; for &s;he was de&s;cended in a direct line, from the child, that Queen Sheba had by King Solomon.

<P>THE Corporal, by this time, and his lady, began to view one another in not that rap|turous point of &s;ight, as at fir&s;t. All the plate, and ready money, which &s;he had taken with her, was expended; for Mr. Knott, had too much of the fine gentleman in him, not to be fond of play; and too good an opinion of him|&s;elf, to fancy any per&s;on could take him in; but after the money was all gone, his eyes were opened, and he determined to commence gam|bler him&s;elf.</P>
<P>At his quarters lodged a Mountebank and his man. The Merry Andrew was a ma&s;ter of arts in &s;porting; he could bend, &s;lip, &s;hade, &s;pur, feather-edge, work a brief, knew &s;horts and longs, the high and low games at put, the three &s;huffles of whi&s;t, upper and under palm, opening a pack, or rounding dice, with all the &s;ecures, the bars, loads, ringing of changes, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>

<P>I wi&s;h, &s;ome ladies of my acquaintance, with whom it is at this moment a to&s;s up, between inclination and intere&s;t, would read this part of my book carefully; and they would know, not|with&s;tanding, modern memoirs mention whi&s;|pering Zephyrs, eternal con&s;tancy, love-lane a&s;&s;ignations, breath-&s;topped ki&s;&s;es, midnight moon-&s;hine, a charming fellow, and the po&s;t chai&s;e door open,&mdash;that according to the un|doubted te&s;timonials of &s;everal maiden gentle-women, who, by heart-felt experience, vow, a lady is wor&s;e cooped up, who goes off with her gallant, than the mo&s;t dome&s;tic wife, that un|dergoes the drudgery of the nur&s;ery, and kitchen.</P>
<P>Let us only example Mrs. Llwhyddwhuydd.

<P>Think ladies, what Mr. David's wife &s;uffer|ed; who, like all other eloping ladies, had tru&s;ted the gallant with all, and dreaded to a&s;k him for a &s;ingle &s;hilling, le&s;t he &s;hould think her extravagant; denying her&s;elf nece&s;&s;aries, becau&s;e he &s;hould not grumble at expence How melancholy her ca&s;e; no companions, but her own thoughts, reflecting and comparing pa&s;t, with pre&s;ent times; her former re&s;pect, her pre|&s;ent

<P>It is not, I hope, &s;o bad with every lovely lady errantre&s;s. Yet many of them have experienc|ed,&mdash;don't &s;igh, dear creatures;&mdash;I know its a melancholy &s;cene, and in the cata&s;trophe &s;till more vexatious; becau&s;e the rea&s;on which &s;ome ladies alledge, for running away from their guardians or parents, is, the unbearable u&s;age, which they receive at home, therefore apply to gallants, in hopes of mending their condition, as flying fi&s;h &s;pring out of the &s;ea to avoid the Dolphin, and tumble into the jaws of the &s;hark.</P>
<P>Yet as the mo&s;t time-&s;erving-&s;cribbler &s;ub|&s;cribes him&s;elf, at the bottom of a dedication, to his right honourable patron; as the trade&s;man bows, bill in hand, to his honour, with paral|lel awe, I addre&s;s the ladies, and a&s;&s;ure them, that my opinion of their magnanimity, will not &s;uffer me to imagine, any thing here &s;aid, can alter what a fine woman has already re&s;olved upon.&mdash;No&mdash;&s;pite of all advice or example, her &s;pirits will carry her through, whatever her will gives the word for, let the con&s;equence be&mdash;no matter what.</P>
<P>David's &s;pou&s;e had, for &s;ome time, been in a mo&s;t uncomfortable &s;tate. She felt the &s;evere pinches of nece&s;&s;ity, which are evident &s;ymptoms of repentance; daily, hourly did &s;he reproach her&s;elf, how ill &s;he had u&s;ed her dear, dear hu&s;|band; how ill her gallant had u&s;ed her; not a friend had &s;he to confide in, except the Merry Andrew above-mentioned; to him &s;he now and then di&s;clo&s;ed her griefs; he proffered her all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his power; vowed he had a va&s;t
<PB N="83" REF="98">regard for her, and &s;ealed tho&s;e vows, upon her lips; ju&s;t at the in&s;tant, the Corporal opened the door.</P>
<P>All in rage, Mr. Knott ru&s;hed on the tum|bler, kicked him down &s;tairs; b&mdash;d his lady, and vowed never again to bed her.</P>
<P>Indeed Mr. Knott was glad of an occa&s;ion to break off the acquaintance; for he found it very heavy, &s;upporting her out of his pay; and be&s;ide, he had commenced another intrigue, with a lady who kept a raffle, who had agreed to go off with him.</P>
<P>The tumbler, all in a rage, for being u&s;ed &s;o by the Corporal; went in&s;tantly to his ma&s;|ter, and di&s;covered, that the night before, him|&s;elf and the Corporal had cheated the doctor at cards, of fifteen pounds, four &s;hillings; and told his ma&s;ter, that his con&s;cience would not let him keep it.</P>
<P>No one thing can hurt a lady, or gentleman, or any other two legged exi&s;tent, if there are any other per&s;ons, in this kingdom, that are not either gentlemen or ladies, except &s;ome of the Opera Singers.&mdash;I &s;ay, and am &s;ure, nothing can hurt &s;o much, as being made a fool, or a tool, unle&s;s &s;elf-intere&s;t orders it &s;o to be.&mdash;then, indeed, as A&mdash;B&mdash;C&mdash;D&mdash;E&mdash;and&mdash;&amp;c. ob&s;erved, it is proper to appear in ta&s;te.</P>
<P>But to be a tool, and be out of pocket by it,&mdash;Seneca, at the head of his &s;toical regiment of Old Buffs, could not bear it.</P>
<P>And as the doctor, like all other doctors, wore a &s;word (which, I believe, the faculty at fir&s;t bore emblematically, to denote an aptitude to kill) after a con&s;ultation, with his Merry Andrew,
<PB N="84" REF="99">he determined upon having his money, and &s;ent Mr. Knott the following letter.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The Corporal received this note, as he &s;at over a large bowl of punch, with two recruits ju&s;t li&s;ted. He was as brave, as Briti&s;h &s;pirits could make him; and reading the letter, &s;wore 'twas very well, he'd come; he would do every thing like a gentleman, and give every body &s;atisfac|tion&mdash;but as to returning, or paying the money back, he was above it.&mdash;No, he was too much a man of honour, he &s;wore, to be compelled, no, the &s;word &s;hould decide it.</P>
<P>All flu&s;h, all gallant was Mr. Knott, the drum beating, recruits &s;inging, and bumpers going bri&s;kly about.&mdash;Yet the contents of the letter, began like oil, to prevent the potency of
<PB N="85" REF="100">the brandy punch, any longer &s;ublimating into the Corporal's head.</P>
<P>Not that he feared the doctor, or even death, the pre&s;ident and commander in chief of all doctors; but his honour was doubly concerned; he promi&s;ed to meet a lady, a new lady, that night; and he would not break that appoint|ment, for twenty doctors; but then, who would dare to &s;ay, Knott wou'd'nt fight? No body &s;hould; he &s;wore, and in order to keep his word and honour, with both parties, he laid his plan of operations accordingly.</P>
<P>The doctor, who was equally political, <HI>(in what a political age do we now live!)</HI> made this appointment by moon-light, becau&s;e his anta|goni&s;t &s;hould not di&s;cover, that he had a quire of white paper for a brea&s;t-plate, fa&s;tened neatly under his &s;hirt.</P>
<P>Each combatant, firmed in his &s;afeguard &s;cheme, went with the utmo&s;t intrepidity to the combat. Nobly, magnanimou&s;ly they met. So when&mdash;no&mdash;come, all ye &s;pirits, who have in&s;pired the belligerant powers, to firm fight|ing; and thou, whoever thou art, whether begot by Folly, or Madne&s;s, or both; thou AETHERNAL, who pre&s;ides over duels, &s;uitable-&s;pirit for &s;uch a &s;ubject, in&s;pire me, to de&s;cribe the memorable behaviour, of tho&s;e truly paired belloni&s;ts, who &s;o intrepidly paraded upon the &s;uppo&s;ed-to-be-&s;anguinary-&s;pot; and then, &s;o woundle&s;s,&mdash;&s;o&mdash;&s;o&mdash;&s;o.&mdash;<HI>So have I &s;een</HI> &mdash; ay, reader, and &s;o may you al&s;o have &s;een, as well as me, a great many things; but among all the &s;hews, did you ever ob&s;erve a &s;lit deal figure, &s;et up, on the top of a malt-hou&s;e tunnel, or, as a &s;care-&s;crow in a garden, holding in each hand
<PB N="86" REF="101">a wooden &s;word; which, by the contrivance of the carpenter, and force of the wind, whirl'd its arms about, above, and below, acro&s;s, a|round, &s;la&s;hing, &s;triking, flouri&s;hing, in every prize-fighting direction, ingratefully thra&s;hing that air, which puts it in motion.</P>
<P>Thus is a duelli&s;t agitated, by honour, which is no more than air; a puff, a wind, a vapour.&mdash;Mi&s;take not the editor's meaning&mdash;he is only writing concerning the term honour, which urges, planet &s;truck people, to take the unnece&s;&s;ary trouble of cutting one another's throats, when, as the madman ob&s;erved, <HI>let but your enemies alone, and they'll dye of them&s;elves.</HI></P>
<P>But duelli&s;ts, like Job&s;on at blindman's buff, lay about them, &s;lap, da&s;h, north, ea&s;t, we&s;t, &s;outh, on every point of the compa&s;s, becau&s;e this honour an&s;wers to all points, all make a point of honour.</P>
<P>It was one of honour's points, the money-getting point, which goaded the doctor to this honourable experiment, and which the Editor, would not have been &s;o explicit in, had he not taken the trouble of vi&s;iting tennis courts, billiard-rooms, hor&s;e-race meetings, whi&s;t-clubs, &s;kettle-grounds, hazard-tables, and nine hole alleys; and been a&s;&s;ured from all parties there, that the doctor was right (in point of honour) to demand his money; and the Corporal was right (in point of honour) to refu&s;e returning it.</P>
<P>The place appointed for their meeting, was a very wide, dry trench, high mounded on each &s;ide, and open at each end, like that part of New Market turf, called the devil's ditch, and where, for the name &s;ake, all hereafter duels &s;hould be decided.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="102">They came to the, &s;pot, ju&s;t as the clock &s;truck nine, they drew their &s;words, and &s;tood in quart and tierce attitudes, between four and five yards a&s;under.</P>
<P>They flouri&s;hed their blades, on which the moon &s;hine bright beaming, the glare &s;tartled the heroes.</P>
<P>As veracity is the Editor's principle ob&s;ervance, throughout this treati&s;e, it is nece&s;&s;ary, to re|late how two &s;uch men could be brought to the &s;cene of action, and draw their &s;words at each other.</P>
<P>The doctor was a&s;&s;ured by his tumbler, that if he did but &s;end a challenge, it would bring the Corporal to any terms, and he had nothing to do, but only go to the appointment, draw his &s;word, and Knott would return the money.</P>
<P>After (by his man's advice) the letter was &s;ent, the mountebank began to have &s;ome qualms&mdash;he doubted, he was di&s;mayed, and as Mr. John We&s;ley, and Mr. John We&s;|ley's coadjutors, have often declared, <HI>that Satan buffetted them about;</HI> even &s;o was the doctor's tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ghts to&s;&s;ed, here and there, and not know|ing what to make of him&s;elf, he re&s;olved to bumper it about until fighting time, to drive off even the idea of death.</P>
<P>Not that he way any &s;tranger to that &s;pectre; having employed him in as many &s;hapes, as the doctor had patients; but he wanted not that fiend, to have any concerns with him&s;elf; therefore he drank to fortify his mind, and wore a &s;tationary brea&s;t-plate, to barricade his noble parts.</P>
<P>The Corporal marched to the rende&s;vouz, with a certainty of &s;ucce&s;s.&mdash;Fir&s;t from his
<PB N="88" REF="103">own con&s;equence, that the quack &s;coundrel dare not fight him; next, let it even come to the wor&s;t, and he &s;hould be obliged to draw his &s;word,&mdash;Mr. Knott had planned &s;uch a &s;cheme,&mdash;and entirely by the &s;cale, &s;ector, and true modern practi&s;e of duelling, which is, to ac|quire the va&s;t, va&s;t honour, of being a fighting man, and duelli&s;t, without running any dange|rous ri&s;que.</P>
<P>The Corporal's plot was, to wait for his an|tagoni&s;t, to make the fir&s;t thur&s;t, then to fall backwards immediately, and bid the doctor make the be&s;t of his way off, becau&s;e that he him&s;elf was a dead man, the doctor having done for him.</P>
<P>Both thus &s;ecure in their &s;afe-guards, &s;tood firm&mdash;but at the di&s;tance before-mentioned; indeed it is proper, all quarrelling people &s;hould &s;o keep a&s;under; their right arms were extend|ed, &s;word point-paralled to &s;word point.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, the doctor being by drink, the mo&s;t elevated, quavered out, ha, ha, and &s;tamped his foot at the &s;ame time; but the unfaithful &s;od, &s;inking to his tread, brought his body forwards; de&s;troyed the centre of gravity, and prone on his face he fell, without &s;tretched arm and wea|pon.</P>
<P>The Corporal ob&s;erved the glittering &s;teel ad|vance, backwards at that &s;ignal fell down, and with a great groan cried out&mdash;O I am done for&mdash;it's through and through me.&mdash;Doctor I forgive you&mdash;but make the be&s;t of your way off&mdash;for&mdash;oh&mdash;I am a dead man.</P>
<P>Terrified at the&s;e words, his antagoni&s;t reflect|ing on what it was to kill a man, and not ac|cording to the &s;ecundum artem &s;tatute; crawled
<PB N="89" REF="104">backwards on his hands and knees, crab like, out of the oppo&s;ite end of the ditch. Leaving his &s;word (as he &s;uppo&s;ed) &s;ticking in the Cor|poral's body; as &s;oon as he got upon his feet, he &s;camper'd off, &s;trait forwards, not minding which road he took, all he thought of, at that time was, the hue and cry, which he fancied he heard very plainly behind him.</P>
<P>The Corporal, ri&s;ing by degrees, was &s;oon &s;atisfied of the &s;ucce&s;s of his &s;cheme, and pick|ing up the duplicate &s;word, ha&s;tened to his other rende&s;vouz, and there he &s;hewed his new lady the weapon, which he had brought away with him; telling Madam Raffle, <Q>I was obliged to kick that &s;coundrel mountebank, my dear, and make him deliver up his &s;word, here it is you &s;ee, for his in&s;olence, to pretend to dare to hint any thing again&s;t your reputation.</Q></P>
<P>In the beginning of every intrigue, fond beauty fancies all is go&s;pel, which her gallant &s;peaks.&mdash;Knott's new mi&s;tre&s;s replied, <Q>That to be &s;ure, I knowed as how, Mr. Corporal, you was a va&s;tly brave man; and we will live and dy, and I'll go through the world with you.</Q>&mdash;But the cata&s;trophe of their loves hereafter.</P>
<P>We have now got rid of a pair of lovers, as dextrou&s;ly as any play wright, who after cun|ningly bringing them together, gives the promp|ter a cue&mdash;wheu&mdash;wheu whi&s;tles Mr. Pimper|limpimp, the word giver, and the brace of woers are inter&s;ected from the audience, by the canvas land&s;cape, or &s;ize painted &s;treet &s;cene; and the re&s;t of the comedy goes on as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>When our la&s;t expre&s;s came away, the moun|tebank was on foot, terribly racing it along,
<PB N="90" REF="105">panting and trembling,&mdash;the conclu&s;ion of his helter &s;kelter flight we &s;hall now relate under the Anti-comic title, of</P>

<P>This will be illu&s;trated in the continuance of the quack's hi&s;tory, who we left upon foot, nor have we yet brought him to a &s;tand-&s;till. Fright made him mi&s;s his way, it was midnight before he reached the gates of his inn; they were barred, and every candle out in the neigh|bourhood.</P>
<P>Plea&s;ed to think all was &s;o quiet, he re&s;olved to creep up the back way into the yard, get his money and cloaths out of his room, before day|light, and &s;ecrete him&s;elf among the miners.</P>
<P>Up a broken butterice, belonging to the gar|den, he &s;crambled, and got a&s;tride the wall; ju&s;t as Tom the tap&s;ter opened the garden-door, in his breeches, &s;hirt and &s;lippers.</P>
<P>The moon brightly &s;hining at the mounte|bank's back, made a long black &s;hadow upon the gra&s;s-plat; which, moving before the &s;er|vant's eyes, &s;topped him from &s;tepping forward; his knees knocked together, his teeth chattered, his feet he drew &s;oftly out of the &s;lippers, and and &s;idling barefooted, he &s;lunk into a dark ar|bour at his left hand.</P>
<P>The medicine-monger was not a whit le&s;s terrified, at &s;eeing a human figure in white; for the moon gave him full view of the tap&s;ter. A cro&s;s the wall he &s;at agha&s;t; he thrice attempt|ed to &s;ay &s;ome prayers, but had none to &s;ay. He muttered the only religious &s;entiment, which he knew, viz. grace after meat; &s;aying, Lord make me thankful for what I have received&mdash;this over and over he repeated, holding him&s;elf on the
<PB N="93" REF="108">wall by the help of his hands, as a &s;ailor fixes his fi&s;ts upon the &s;addle pommel.</P>
<P>The doctor was confident he &s;aw the Corpo|ral's gho&s;t; almo&s;t petrified with apprehen&s;ion, he &s;at there, and there would have &s;at until morning, had not the &s;tronger fear, lea&s;t the gho&s;t &s;hould be creeping along the &s;ide of the wall, to &s;eize him, forced him from his place; and heaving him&s;elf up by his hands, he &s;trad|dling, throwed him&s;elf along the wall, on the ridge of the bricks, with his eyes all the time fixed on that &s;pot, from whence the gho&s;t had vani&s;hed.</P>
<P>He reached the top of an old cow-hou&s;e, and rolling him&s;elf upon it, his weight broke the boards, and betwixt two rafters he &s;ell, jammed midway; his weight forced him down, his bulk prevented his whole body to fall through; there he was wedged fa&s;t by the wai&s;tband, and fancy|ing all hell held him, he &s;hrieked, roared, kicked, flung his arms about, and tumbled the loo&s;ened rotten planks over and over.</P>
<P>The poor drawer, hearing the dreadful out|cries, ecchoed his &s;hrieks, with &s;hrieks more &s;hrill, and run up the yard, calling out help, murder, fire, help, help.</P>
<P>The noi&s;e wakened every one in the inn ex|cept the landlord. Each &s;tarted up terrified at the exclamation, confu&s;ion, and affright &s;eized them; from fir&s;t, &s;econd floors, and garrets; from down, feather, and flocks, all came, hurry &s;curry, like mob from the twelve-penny gallery.&mdash;Back to her own bed, Betty the chamber|maid &s;lipped, to put &s;ome things on, leaving her gallant, a London rider, &s;haking in a fear-rai&s;ed argue fit.</P>

All the re&s;t of the good company half dre&s;&s;ed, a&s;&s;embled round the tap&s;ter, who told them, there was a &s;pirit playing the devil in the old cow-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>By the tempting promi&s;e of two guineas, the three o&s;tlers and a &s;tage-coachman were per|&s;uaded to go armed with pitchforks, to find out this gho&s;t, and the company, the female part, all went together, to get the re&s;t of their cloaths on; and the gentlemen the &s;ame; agreeing to meet in the large dining room to hear farther particulars. And Sir Greenfin Calipa&s;h, was to be &s;eated in the grand chair, to take the examination.</P>
<P>While the gue&s;ts were getting ready, all big with expectation, like the polite audiences in Cock-lane; a new noi&s;e alarmed them, an out|cry, which was within the hou&s;e, proceeding from the landlord, who having been put to bed very drunk, was by the continuation of the va|rious noi&s;es waked; and parched with thir&s;t, bawled out loud as a&s;&s;es bray &mdash; <HI>&s;ome oat-ale, a tankard of oat-ale, and be&mdash;to ye.</HI></P>

<P>Had I, my mo&s;t ineffable auditors, had I my books and in&s;truments here, I might perhaps have demon&s;trated this more clearly.</P>
<P>Sir Tim.

<P>The under-bred part of the a&s;&s;embly, allowed him to be a mo&s;t wonderful man; and every one, gentle and &s;imple, joined in prai&s;ing loud|ly his late lecture, and great learning; and they agreed he had made it out &s;o well, that they all under&s;tood it.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> Journal of M. TRIP.</HEAD>
<P>I William Trip, mate of the Concord tran&s;|port, captain Robert Farding, of Lynn Regis, ma&s;ter, do declare, that as we were coming from Li&s;bon, June 7, 1759; it happened to be my watch upon deck, I &s;aw a bean cod over&s;et in
<PB N="104" REF="119">our &s;hip's wake, ju&s;t as we were coming out of the Tagus.</P>
<P>We having not taking in our boat, I got down abaft, ca&s;t off the painter, and &s;kulled away, to pick up a per&s;on I &s;aw floating, and brought him on board our ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>The gentleman whom I got out of the water happened to be a Roman Catholic par&s;on, one whom they call in their lingo a Je&s;uit, and who had got out of Portugal by &s;tealth.</P>
<P>He was very ill while he was on board us, and I tended him. So one day, as we lay off the Wight, he &s;ent to &s;peak with me; and when I came, he de&s;ired me to &s;it down by him, and hear &s;ometing he had to &s;ay to me.</P>
<P>Upon which, that I might be, as one may &s;ay, yard arm and yard arm, with him, I got a coil of rope, clapt it aloft my &s;ea che&s;t, brought it along &s;ide his hammock, &s;o I &s;et down on it, and our heads were then on the &s;ame latitude toge|ther.</P>
<P>So then he began (reaching out his hand on the &s;tarboard &s;ide) &s;ays he, my good friend&mdash;you have been &s;o civil to me, that I have no way to return your kindne&s;s, but by making you a pre|&s;ent of this book of receipts, and telling you a piece of &s;ecret hi&s;tory, that you may make money of it, if you have a mind to print it.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know, Mr. Trip, that our &s;ociety, for many years, found our intere&s;t declining both in France and Portugal; and therefore our &s;uperiors thought of re-e&s;tabli&s;hing them&s;elves in England.</P>
<P>Several mi&s;&s;ionaries that were &s;ent from Rome to England, a&s;&s;ured us in their letters, that the Engli&s;h people would believe any thing, that
<PB N="105" REF="120">the &s;y&s;tem or fa&s;hion of the minds of the gene|rality, of both the high and low life multitude turned upon an axis, who&s;e points were CON|CEIT, and CREDULITY.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s which the methodi&s;ts, and their doctrines met with, encouraged us greatly; nay our &s;ociety received &s;everal letters from their mo&s;t eminent preachers in your i&s;land; and they told us, our mi&s;&s;ion would be received, provid|ed we joined them; and that upon particular pecuniary conce&s;&s;ions on our &s;ide, they would unite with us. Becau&s;e they a&s;&s;ured us, they mu&s;t and would be of infinite &s;ervice to our &s;o|ciety, &s;ince they knew &s;o well how to work upon the multitude.</P>
<P>Before we would con&s;ent to &s;ign any articles with them, we re&s;olved, from experiment, to di&s;cover how far we could venture to impo&s;e upon the people of England.</P>
<P>I was di&s;patched upon that mi&s;&s;ion, and to prevent &s;u&s;picion, or the lea&s;t inquiry of what I was, I made intere&s;t to be engaged, as one of the &s;ubaltern players, belonging to the Theatre in London, only to do trifling parts; and when I was once &s;een upon the Stage in that capaci|ty, it was impo&s;&s;ible any per&s;on could &s;u&s;pect I was good for any thing.</P>
<P>A brother of our order followed me with fre&s;h in&s;tructions; but as his part required he &s;hould be introduced at all hours, and in all places, to the very be&s;t company; he a&s;&s;umed the cha|racter of an Italian fiddler, tooth cleaner and de&s;igner; and when we have met to compare notes in an evening, he has made me &s;mile, to hear him relate how every door u&s;ed to fly open at his approach; and he would go&s;&s;ip for two
<PB N="106" REF="121">hours with very great per&s;onages, while the anti-chamber would be full of colonels and com|modores, waiting for an audience.</P>
<P>The earthquake was of my projecting, &s;o was the bottle-conjurer, it was me who wrote the prophecy for the per&s;on called the life-guard|man; but in reality he was porter to the Fanci&s;|cans at Padua.</P>
<P>He, as you may remember, foretold the re|turn of the earthquake would happen &s;uch a day, and Bloom&s;bury-fields, and Bloom&s;bury|&s;quare, was filled with coaches; and whole fa|milies crammed in them, who there &s;et all night, not daring to tru&s;t them&s;elves in their own hou&s;es. I &s;miled when I &s;aw them thus huddled together; but was amazed to &s;ee many of your preachers hurrying out of town, as if they were panick &s;truck with the dread of leaving <HI>this</HI> world&mdash;when they are certain, there is one &s;o infinitely preferable, and in which, by the doctrines they profe&s;s, they mu&s;t be eternally happy.</P>
<P>Are they, thought I, only like phy&s;icians, who admini&s;ter medicines for the good of mankind, <HI>(as they &s;ay)</HI> yet have no faith in their own pre|&s;criptions.</P>
<P>One afternoon, by chance, I met with Eliza|beth Canning; &s;he had lo&s;t &s;ix-pence, was cry|ing about, dared not to go home, &s;he &s;aid&mdash;I ob|&s;erved her, &s;he had the mo&s;t &s;tupid look, yet on conver&s;ing with her, I di&s;covered &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed cunning and ob&s;tinacy.</P>
<P>By the promi&s;e of making up her lo&s;s, a new topknot, and the temptation of riding in a hack|ney-coach, I prevailed upon her to go with me, and when &s;he was perfect in her part, I ex|hibited
<PB N="107" REF="122">her, as you mu&s;t remember; this &s;cheme an&s;wered, to prove Engli&s;h peoples aptne&s;s to embrace, or take part with incoherencies.</P>
<P>Rejoiced I was, when the gentleman, who endeavoured to detect the impo&s;ture, met with &s;uch oppo&s;ition by his example. I was &s;ure other magi&s;trates would be deterred from making any other &s;trict and impartial enquires&mdash;for in|deed Mr. Trip (thus the Je&s;uit went on) though your nation is one of the be&s;t in the world, yet at pre&s;ent, folly and prejudice have &s;pread them|&s;elves &s;o pe&s;tilentially among all ranks and de|nominations; that any per&s;on, who now would en deavour to benefit his country from a prai&s;e|worthy principle of integrity&mdash;So great is the defection throughout all degrees&mdash;&s;o epide|mic the contagion of &s;elf-intere&s;t; the patriot would be hooted at for a madman, reviled as a pretender, or puni&s;hed with contempt, and if po&s;&s;ible with beggary.</P>
<P>Preferment makes the Engli&s;h nation be|have, ju&s;t as the children of I&s;rael did, when the manna fell among them, they &s;natch up all they can, overload them&s;elves often&mdash; no matter, by this method, le&s;s is left for their neighbours.</P>
<P>After this affair was over, I was &s;ent for back to Rome upon &s;pecial affairs, relative to our &s;ociety; but I left a brother of our order full in&s;tructions how to proceed, and the plan for a project, that, as &s;oon as he recovered, he was to put in execution; it was the COCK-LANE PHANTOM, or what was then called <HI>Mi&s;s Fan|ney</HI>'s <HI>Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>This was our mo&s;t favourite &s;cheme, this was our corner &s;tone; we therefore employed
<PB N="108" REF="123">more&mdash;I &s;uppo&s;e he would have &s;aid <HI>&s;kill,</HI> but our &s;hip, at that moment, by the wind &s;hifting, took &s;uch a lu&s;t, that her lee-ruff-tree dipped in the water, and the Je&s;uit was canted overboard out of his hammock, pitched his head upon the trunnion of a four pounder, and never &s;poke another word.</P>
<P>I was over&s;et, but I &s;oon righted; but as for my companion, death clapped a &s;topper upon his tongue, as quick as one could crack a bi&s;cuit.</P>
<P>And this is the truth, and the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, as witne&s;s my hand.</P>

<P>The &s;econd is the winding-&s;heet gho&s;t, or torch-holding-immateriality; which is a love&s;ick maiden, that glideth along the mid|night dew, to undraw the feet curtains of her for&s;worn &s;wain, and bidding him be|think

<P>The third and la&s;t is the hobgobblin, or raw head and bloody bones&mdash;this is very ter|rifying, and often u&s;ed to appear to &s;everal particular per&s;ons, both at &s;ea and land, an hour or two before an engagement&mdash;but it is at pre&s;ent, as well as the love-&s;ick gho&s;t, almo&s;t out of fa&s;hion.</P></Q>

<HEAD>A DISSERTATION on DAILY-PAPERS.</HEAD>
<P>No Patriot, in or out of place, ever con&s;i|dered their utility, with that grateful attention, the&s;e publications de&s;erve.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="128">Is there a want in the world, but what may be in&s;tantly relieved, if the patient will but con|&s;ult the columns of tho&s;e morning and evening intelligencies? with as much gravity, as ever any one of the faculty pulled off his gloves; I do declare, that without the help of the&s;e dic|tionaries for the day, the great bu&s;ine&s;s of the nation could not be carried on.</P>
<P>How could Mrs. Philips hope for the continu|ance of her cu&s;tomers? or the nobility and gen|try know where to pay in their Opera &s;ub&s;crip|tions? where could they &s;end for the be&s;t royal beautifying fluid? or could be &s;ure of having French chicken gloves genuine? how &s;hould we know when Mr. Whitfield preaches in Edin|burgh, or Georgia? or where we &s;hould be &s;ure of Roman purl unadulterated? how &s;hould we be a&s;certained where the mo&s;t notified Dr. Tay|lor performs his occuli&s;tical, or oratorial ope|rations? or where the be&s;t liquid blacking is to be got? where to &s;end for the pure aetherial volatile quinte&s;&s;ence of e&s;&s;ence? or how could we be informed, that the &s;ea-water at Bright-Helm&s;tone, is better than any other &s;ea-water? were it not for being &s;o in&s;tructed, by paragraphs and adverti&s;ements afore&s;aid. O credulity, cre-credulity, thou univer&s;al power, how much are we indebted to thy influences?</P>
<P>New di&s;coveries, elixirs, lotions, injections, and no&s;trums, for the ladies, are (as we read) to be had at every toy-&s;hop.</P>
<P>Sometimes, indeed, the applications and u&s;es of the&s;e extraordinary &s;uccedaneums are not expre&s;&s;ed, in &s;o delicate a &s;tile, as polite per|&s;ons might wi&s;h. But when we con&s;ider, the
<PB N="114" REF="129">humane intent of the makers-up, and venders of the&s;e medicines, the &s;tile is excu&s;ed.</P>
<P>As in the country, we put up with the inde|licacy of the entertainment, for the good will of the ho&s;t.</P>
<P>The humanity of the College of Phy&s;icians here mu&s;t be noticed; they have an authority to in&s;pect into medicine-mongers; and can, nay, and &s;hould, and I &s;uppo&s;e do, vi&s;it &s;everal places where drugs are &s;old. Yet it never was known, that any deputation from Gre&s;ham College, or Apothecaries-hall, in&s;pected into the noted Dr. Franks, Dr. Sarrant, Dr. Rock, Dr. Je&s;uit Drop, Dr. Greek Water, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. This wilful omi&s;&s;ion, is owing to the &s;ame public &s;pirit, by which Mr. A&s;hley on Ludgate-hill is agitated; gentlemen of the faculty, are willing to let every per&s;on have phy&s;ic as well as punch, in &s;mall quantities, and therefore wink at the a|fore&s;aid adverti&s;ers.</P>
<P>Yet &s;uch is the malignity of humankind, that even this generous behaviour of the faculty has been found fault with; and the babbling pack of &s;candal yelpers bark out &mdash; that as quacks make di&s;ea&s;es wor&s;e, the profits of the regular bred mu&s;t be thereby increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>Malicious in&s;inuations, as if gentlemen of the M. D. &s;ignatures, would be guilty of &s;uch pitiful fine&s;&s;es. Thus the mad multitude have as ba&s;ely clamoured again&s;t the POLICE.&mdash;The low-life herd of hirelings give out, that truly, if the worthies in commi&s;&s;ion would but take half as much pains to &s;uppre&s;s the bawdy-hou&s;es, bagnios, &amp;c. in their pari&s;hes, as they labour to take highwaymen, it would be of more benefit
<PB N="115" REF="130">to the nation in general&mdash;but how little do the&s;e people know of &s;porting&mdash;if the cover was grub|bed up, the breeding of game would be prevented; how then could money for a &s;ub&s;cription pack of harriers, tarriers, &amp;c. be collected?</P>
<P>With what force I ween?&mdash;but good heaven forgive us, God ble&s;s their maje&s;ties, and every per&s;on who is commi&s;&s;ioned by them, to &s;ee ju&s;tice done as it &s;hould be.&mdash;And as Mr. Jacob Henriques ob&s;erves, it is all for the glorificati|on of Old England.</P>
<P>When I mention the word quacks, it is not to be pre&s;umed, that any gentleman recipe-ven|der, acting under letters patents, can be hinted at; becau&s;e we are all certain, patents are only granted to men of excellent &s;cience, of approv|ed education, who&s;e di&s;coveries have been owing to indefatigable &s;tudy, and are witne&s;s from re|peated experiments, before the mo&s;t &s;killful, to be entirely calculated for the health and pre&s;er|vation of the people of England.</P>
<P>The&s;e, and many more u&s;es than the&s;e, be|long to news-papers, they not only bring health to patients, but ladies to de&s;pairing lovers, and wives to hu&s;bands, as in the ca&s;e of Mr. and Mrs. Llwhyddwhuydd now under our con&s;ide|ration; had it not been for the conveniency of adverti&s;ing, when could they have come toge|ther again.</P>
<P>Yet David did not de&s;cend one grain from the dignity of in-bred honour, by permiting his wife to return home.</P>
<P>For while he had one ready-money cu&s;tomer left, his big heart de&s;pi&s;ed &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; but when all his trade was lo&s;t, the garri&s;on of his great
<PB N="116" REF="131">mind was forced to capitulate, his noblene&s;s of &s;pirit and blood of Japhet, were forced to &s;ur|render pri&s;oners of war, at and to di&s;cretion. <HI>He obeyed the times.</HI> Madam Llwhyddwhuydd gave him her hand, he ki&s;&s;ed it&mdash;tears of joy &s;welled over his eye brinks, and he told her, in the name of God and good people, how his heart was glad to &s;ee her, to be &s;ure, and I do hope in deed, I do now.</P>

<P>Her &s;pou&s;e, though in raptures at the &s;tateli|ne&s;s of his wife's ge&s;ture; yet the re&s;olution of her look frightened him; fearful that &s;he &s;hould make away with her&s;elf, e&s;pecially as he had been at &s;uch an expence to fetch her home too; he kneel'd down and begged her to be pacified, and forgive him, if he had &s;aid any thing ami&s;s.</P>
<P>She forgave him, and rai&s;ed him with a tender reconciling look, equal to what the mo&s;t en|raged (though detected) lady can &s;often into, when her hu&s;band has made a proper humiliati|on, and giving up all his informers.</P>
<P>For it is not po&s;&s;ible a man can love his lady, either married or unmarried, unle&s;s he will

<P>SOON after Mrs. Llwhyddwhuydd's return, Mr. Ap Thomas, her &s;pou&s;e's partner, with a full pot of porter in his hand, happened to run again&s;t her, ju&s;t as &s;he came from her Sunday noon's walk in St. James's Park.</P>

<P>The word vulgar, was grimgribber, to the ancient Briton; to be reflected upon, as if he was not a gentleman, irritated him to that de|gree, that he returned her &s;evere words; with words yet more &s;evere.</P>

<P>After Madam Llwhyddwhuydd was put into bed, and her go&s;&s;ips a&s;&s;embled, the good women ordered a man-midwife to be &s;ent for; but Mrs. Llwhyddwhuydd knowing the objection her &s;pou&s;e had to men-midwives, was prudent e|nough to refu&s;e &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance, becau&s;e &s;he was &s;ure it would offend her hu&s;band's delicacy.</P>
<P>However, the other ladies were unanimous for a man. She entreated, &s;he begged, they were ob&s;tinate; the di&s;pute was loud, it reached into the &s;treet, and every &s;tall, chandlers-&s;hop, and cellar-keeper in the pari&s;h a&s;&s;embled at the door, and determined, that as they knew David was &s;ent for, he &s;hould not pa&s;s into his own hou&s;e, until they had his word and honour, to &s;end for a man-midwife for his lady; for as each &s;aid, if it was only for the look of the thing, he &s;hould have one; David appeared, at that in&s;tant they &s;urrounded him, as the print relates to you, much better than I can. However, one figure in it, I mu&s;t beg leave to explain; which is, the big-bellied female, who &s;eems to be full of grief&mdash;that lady, is &s;pou&s;e to a mo&s;t celebrated wri|ter of political papers; and who has wrote very &s;everely again&s;t men-midwives; becau&s;e, not be|ing able to pay for their attendance, tho&s;e gen|tlemen had refu&s;ed their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>She was a party deeply concerned in this di&s;|pute, and it afflicted her, to take notice of Da|vids ob&s;tinacy&mdash;he indeed once or twice at|tempted to &s;peak&mdash;but it was a vain attempt; as he could not, we beg leave to &s;peak for him.</P>

<P><PB N="125" REF="142">Mr. Llwhyddwhuydd was too fond a hu&s;band to deny his wife what &s;he de&s;ired; but being a great reader, the news-papers and magazines informed him of the indecency, indelicacy, and evil tendency of having men-midwives.</P>
<P>The putters together of tho&s;e daily and month|ly paragraph compendiums had proved, that no hu&s;band of nice honour, would &s;uffer a man-midwife; and as David was a man of the nice&s;t honour, how could he endure them?</P>
<P>In &s;ome papers it was hinted, that men-mid|wives could be of no u&s;e, becau&s;e the Indian women delivered them&s;elves.</P>
<P>In other papers it was in&s;erted, that in a &s;tate of nature, there were neither men midwives, nor par&s;ons; and that people could do well with|out both; and as how in the fir&s;t ages, and the fir&s;t ages were the be&s;t ages, and that this age was the wor&s;t age; but in the fir&s;t ages there were no arts, or &s;ciences, nor occa&s;ion for any; that people would live better with|out them, than with them; that neither man|kind or womankind had need for more help than the animals in the fields; or the fowls of the air; that it was only villainous cu&s;tom, evil habits, wrong tendencies, and the prejudice of education; that made us employ &s;urgeons, tay|lors, chymi&s;ts, &s;hoe-makers, men-midwives, dancing-ma&s;ters, &s;nuff-makers, French-cooks, &s;addles, &s;hirts, &s;hifts, or pocket-handkerchiefs.</P>
<P>From the information of tho&s;e weekly paid journali&s;ts, we may ea&s;ily account why GREAT SCHOLARS, who &s;tudy nature &s;o nicely, are &s;uch GREAT SLOVENS; as they know by their extreme &s;kill, that we are not &s;uperior to the
<PB N="126" REF="143">bea&s;ts; they chu&s;e to retain as much brutality as po&s;&s;ible in their behaviour.</P>
<P>David, like the traveller in the contention with the wind, wrapped him&s;elf up in his &s;ur|tout, determined to &s;tand out the tempe&s;t; when word was brought him, that madam Llwhydd|whuydd was brought to bed of a fine boy, and as like the father&mdash;</P>
<P>He would not &s;tay to hear the re&s;t of the me&s;&s;enger's ob&s;ervation; bur&s;ting through the crowd, run home, and received the congratulati|ons of his company. Mr. Llwhyddwhuydd in|deed rejoiced having a &s;on and heir; and that was the utmo&s;t of his hopes, wi&s;hes, and pray|ers, before he had read the ob&s;ervations above|mentioned. Yet now his principal &s;atisfaction aro&s;e, from the reflection his lady was brought to bed without the help of a man-midwife.</P>

<P>The authors of Jo&s;eph Andrews and Tri&s;tram Shandy wrote them&s;elves into reputation, and I believe got money by what they did; and really de&s;erved it.&mdash;Ever &s;ince I have engaged in this work, I have endeavoured to copy one or both of their &s;tiles, manners, or maxims; but I can|not fancy my&s;elf quite &s;o clever. Yet have I all that cu&s;tomary fondne&s;s, that becoming par|tiality, for my own works, which every author ought to have; and hold all the re&s;t of my co|temporaries in a trifling light, to my&s;elf. This I do as well as any or all the dramatic writers of England, Ireland or Scotland; but yet I don't find my&s;elf (hone&s;tly &s;peaking) a jot better genius for all the abu&s;e I make u&s;e of.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="144">If the connections I have with publi&s;hers could be on my &s;ide di&s;charged, or a protection granted me, I might wear a laced coat, and live without working, as well as many other gen|tlemen.</P>
<P>Then, I would no more meddle with a pen and ink, than a lady in high keeping would mend her own linnen; for my mind &s;corns the drudgery of writing, reading, and reflecting, as much as any rich man in the kingdom can do.</P>
<P>My wife has an acquaintance, who promi&s;es to provide for me, either in the church, the navy, the law, the army, the cu&s;toms, at court, or in the exci&s;e; it does not &s;ignify what branch it is; for if a man has but intere&s;t, he is fit for any place.</P>

<P>Thus far the Editor compiled of the MSS, and attended on the appointed Sunday at Mr. WARNER'S, who is a very good &s;ort of a man; and one to whom the putter together of the&s;e hi&s;torical paragraphs has been very much obliged.</P>
<P>This would not have been mentioned, but to convince the world <HI>all</HI> authors are not &s;o in|grateful, as to forget the friends, who formerly filled their bellies.</P>
<P>I have compo&s;ed Drolls for Mr. Warner's booth, and by his recommendation, I have wrote &s;everal dramas for the proprietors of pup|pet-&s;hows, in which, I u&s;ed to adhere entirely to the &s;trict rules of <HI>Ari&s;totle, Rapin,</HI> and <HI>Bo&s;&s;u.</HI> The cha&s;tity of ta&s;te among Engli&s;h audiences at that time was &s;o pure, they would not bear the &s;malle&s;t innovation of the unities of time, and place, even in Mr. Punch;&mdash;becau&s;e, as the coffee-hou&s;e connoi&s;&s;eurs ob&s;erved, it is more in&s;tructive, and more elegant, even to be lulled into a &s;lumber, by the rules of art, than kept awake, and in &s;pirits, by all the fire of fancy, contrary to the Greek and French &s;cale or &s;tandard.</P>
<P>At that time Mrs. Charke, &s;i&s;ter to the late Mr. Theophilus Cibber, had a famous puppet-&s;how, which was conducted with &s;uch regulari|ty.&mdash;To compare the puppet-&s;hows of that time, with the puppet-&s;hows of this time, would be only an ill-natured attempt. But Charlotte Charke u&s;ed to pride her&s;elf, that her company, her ladies at lea&s;t, were all ve&s;tals. Becau&s;e, as &s;he &s;aid, a lady belonging to the Theatres
<PB N="135" REF="152">Royal may be weak enough, or fond enough, or mean enough, and mercenary enough, to de&s;cend being upon the town. But who? (Mrs. Charke u&s;ed to exult) who can &s;ay, they ever &s;upped with the Queen of Sheba, at the Shake|&s;pear, or had fair Ro&s;amond at Haddock's?</P>
<P>This daughter of Colley Cibber, the late Poet Laureate, was a lady of &s;urpri&s;ing &s;ingularity; but the oddities of the human mind are unac|countable.</P>
<P>There is his honour Sir ******, a great po|litician; yet all his delight is chucking &s;ix-pence into a quart decanter.</P>
<P>Is not Mr. ***** the great phy&s;ician, an admirer of parched peas; but cannot eat any, except what he cooks him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mr. ***** the famous mathematician, pre|fers battledore and &s;huttle-cock, to painting, poetry, and mu&s;ic; and don't we all know &s;eve|ral dignified ****, who, though amazingly or|thodox, value them&s;elves more upon their ta&s;te, in veni&s;on, and Madeira, than in interpreting the &s;criptures.</P>
<P>Some ladies of di&s;tinction have been known to admire low company; their hu&s;bands at the &s;ame time not caring for any; but it is impo&s;|&s;ible to account why we are whim bitten. So far has oddity been epidemical, that noblemen have been known; nay, and &s;everal at this time are, really fond of their wives; and what is as remarkable, their ladies are as warm in their affections for their hu&s;bands.</P>
<P>Our minds will be attached to irregularities. Mi&s;s ***, with the fine&s;t eyes in England, af|fects to be near &s;ighted; and Lady *****, a mo&s;t charming figure, drawn by elegance, and

<P>Sir ******, one of our mo&s;t eloquent &s;peak|ers, and a gentleman of amazing learning, believes he can &s;pin a top, better than any other man in England, and wants to have 500 upon it.</P>
<P>The Rt. *****, who has &s;even of the fine&s;t children, perhaps in Chri&s;tendom, has impaired his e&s;tate, in purcha&s;ing and preparing butterfly-wings, to line his &s;tudy, in imitation of tape&s;try. And Mr. ***, the mo&s;t eminent attorney in Great Britain, employs his whole time in gudgeon fi&s;hing.</P>
<P>This Mr. Warner above-mentioned, had an oddity of temper, which is uncommon among theatrical managers. He never looked upon his people, to be off the Stage as good as him&s;elf; he never cho&s;e to countenance them as acquain|tance, or be familiar with them as friends.</P>
<P>A fortnight or three weeks preceding the Bo|rough fair, he u&s;ed to have a great levee of peo|ple in the bu&s;ine&s;s, although at that in&s;tant per|haps out of employ; who would wait upon him, to know if he wanted any hands in the acting, &s;inging, dancing, hocus pocus, or han|nock and jannock way.</P>
<P>They u&s;ed at fir&s;t to come about dinner-time, and no per&s;on keeps a better-hou&s;e than he does, or under&s;tands it better; there was always &s;omething good in the pot, or roa&s;ting at the fire. There would they walk up and down the kitch|en &mdash; now glancing at the meat, now at the ma&s;|ter; &s;ometimes darting their eyes down, de|&s;ponding into the dripping pan, then eagerly expectant, lift them up again to the boiler; and

Yet as every biographer is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the friend of the genius, who&s;e life he celebrates, I would advi&s;e Ma&s;ter Ed|ward rather, hereafter, to &s;trike out a new ca&s;t of acting for him&s;elf, where compari&s;ons could not be made. In ju&s;tice to his merit, it mu&s;t be allowed, he, who is capable of being the ma&s;ter Stephen, the Mi&s;er, &amp;c. &amp;c. has a &s;uf|ficiency of comic abilities, to be, without buf|foonery, grimace or mimickry, a capital actor; and be held in a much higher point of character, than what at pre&s;ent he is. Although now he is the drole and comical one of the town, and
<PB N="139" REF="156">plea&s;es them with his performances; it is in his power, not only to give plea&s;ure to an audience, but to gain their e&s;teem; and difficult as that part may be to act, it is worth his while to &s;tudy it.</P>
<P>Edward was in love to all the degrees, &s;allies, and dependencies of de&s;paration.&mdash;The lady ob&s;erved her conque&s;t, and enjoyed it. She knew her man; had heard that, to his girls and his game&s;ters, he did not mind what money he threw away. He was a trout worth tickling, and therefore returned him look for look.</P>
<P>Emboldened by this eye language, he began to contrive a &s;cheme, for enlarging the cor|re&s;pondence. He wi&s;hed to talk with her, but he wanted words &mdash; he wi&s;hed to write to her; but he wanted letters; therefore employed his landland, Mr. THOMAS PHILIPS <HI>(of whom more hereafter)</HI> to be his &s;ecretary.</P>
<P>I cannot forbear mentioning a piece of ingra|titude of Neddy's to that old gentleman, who behaved in this affair extremely friendly to him; and yet &s;o far can gaming ab&s;orb all grateful principles, that Edward has betted twenty to five his landlord won't live until Lady-day next. The conceit of &s;uch a bett has had a violent ef|fect upon the mind of the old gentleman. Mr. Pond al&s;o, to the be&s;t of my remembrance, has &s;uch another wager. I have not, indeed, a &s;yllable to &s;ay again&s;t Mr. Pond; he is as fair a &s;portman as ever &s;tepped up the &s;tand; and pays his betts as punctual, as if he was a man of quality. Yet, after he has &s;aid done to &s;uch a bett; what bu&s;ine&s;s had he to drive Mr. Philips from Greg's coffee-hou&s;e? it &s;eems as if it was de&s;igned, as a heart-breaking &s;troke; &s;ince, to
<PB N="140" REF="157">be debarred from that academy of univer&s;al con|ver&s;ation, mu&s;t be as great a damp upon the &s;pirits of any of the curio&s;i; as it was to Bu&s;&s;y Rabutin, to be bani&s;hed from the French court.</P>
<P>When Mi&s;s Ann became a principal dancer, &s;he had a friend, (a female one I mean) to wait upon her behind the &s;cenes, to watch her moti|ons, and take care of her &s;teps.</P>
<P>This duenna was her relation, and therefore had a more than ordinary care of her charge, lea&s;t detraction &s;hould be malicious.</P>
<P>The ogles which <HI>Neddy</HI> the drole, and <HI>Nancy</HI> the de&s;ireable, reciprocally interchanged, alarm|ed the old lady guardiane&s;s. She trembled at the danger Nancy's honour was in; and &s;oon as they came home that evening, thus began the mo&s;t careful governante.</P>
<P>I once thought, yes, that I did, Mi&s;s Nancy, how you had a better &s;pirit, and a more politer ta&s;te, than to coquet it with a player&mdash;mercy upon us, what is our family fallen too, if this is the ca&s;e? and &s;o you're in love with the fellow, are you? I &s;ay, love too! I'll tell you what, child, when once any fine woman, like you, con|de&s;cends to give her company to people of fa|&s;hion, who can pay her well for it; why there's no harm done&mdash;but for a lady to fall in love, it's ju&s;t like a trade&s;man dealing all upon honour, they had better &s;hut up &s;hop at once, my dear.</P>

<HEAD>An Account of the Continuation of this Work.</HEAD>
<P>AN errand-boy belonging to the printer, vulgarly, and irreligiou&s;ly called a Devil, hearing that, for want of an author, no more copy could be obtained to complete this volume, told his ma&s;ter, he knew a gentleman, who lodged in his mother's back garret; (the author and devil being bed-fellows) who, the boy &s;aid, he was &s;ure would fini&s;h it; becau&s;e he had of|ten heard the gentleman &s;ay, that as far as a pen and ink could go he would undertake any thing.</P>
<P>The Devil being agent for both parties, a bar|gain was immediately &s;truck, between publi&s;her and author, who&s;e name is CANNON, common|ly called, CAPTAIN CANNON, on account of his inventive faculty, or allegorical manner, in which he was won't to expre&s;s him&s;elf.</P>
<P>This per&s;on appeared to be one of the EX|TRAORDINARIES OF THE TIMES, by his ar|gumentatives again&s;t the late <HI>Orator Henley.</HI></P>
<P>In tho&s;e altercations, the loquacity of Cannon was &s;o con&s;picuous; he became a favourite a|mong all the people of exqui&s;ite ta&s;te, particu|larly a mountebank doctor; who admired the lad for the facility of his phy&s;ical and metaphy|&s;ical replies; and determined (even without the lea&s;t intere&s;t being made in the young fellow's behalf) <HI>&s;trange as it may &s;eem,</HI> to encourage &s;o promi&s;ing a genius, therefore con&s;tituted him immediately his MERRY ANDREW.</P>
<P>A widow lady, who&s;e &s;pou&s;e had &s;uffered the &s;everity of the law, becau&s;e he endeavoured, upon
<PB N="161" REF="179">a belligerant principle, to inve&s;tigate the uni|ver&s;al axiom, GET MONEY, fell in love with the Merry Andrew, for eating fire and tow; &s;he was then in equipage, by a very famous mini|&s;terial writer; therefore the lady had power to recommend, or introduce Cannon to her friend; who made him his amanuen&s;is.</P>
<P>Under this ma&s;ter, he became proficient in politics, and was properly initiated in the grand my&s;tery of my&s;teries, or the true art of prefer|ment writing, viz. to DEIFY the INS; and make DEVILS of the OUTS.</P>
<P>The Methods he made u&s;e of in his Pickle-herring capacity, were of infinite &s;ervice to him in his political one. He was al&s;o a very good po&s;ture-ma&s;ter; and that brought him in|to great e&s;teem among his &s;uperiors; and he had hints that he &s;hould be encouraged, equal to the mo&s;t celebrated of the retained writers.</P>
<P>He grew noted among the notified; he was &s;uppo&s;ed to have great intere&s;t with &s;ome people. It was whi&s;pered about, he was in the &s;ecret, therefore when in company, he ab&s;tracted him|&s;elf accordingly.</P>
<P>He began to con&s;ider him&s;elf, and reflect, that &s;uch a writer as he was, and engaged in &s;uch connections, was liable to meet with a &s;udden change of circum&s;tances, either for the better, or wor&s;e, according to the weight, ba|lance, or prejudice of party.</P>
<P>Upon a CHARIOT, and the PILLORY, he daily meditated; as they were both particular exalta|tions, and what he knew had been be&s;towed up|on different per&s;ons very often, for the &s;ame action.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="180">Con&s;cious of his own importance, he formed to him&s;elf a new &s;y&s;tem of behaviour; and a&s;|&s;umed, wore, and bore an author-like con&s;e|quence.</P>
<P>He had his &s;hoes cleaned every day, and wrote E. S. Q. R. after his name. The wai|ters at the coffee-hou&s;es made bows to him; and the landlord at the Shake&s;pear &s;hook him by the hand. He had the liberty of the &s;cenes, gave his opinion in the green-room, and told every body, how many days in the week he dined with my lord.</P>
<P>Then he wore a &s;word, and a &s;nuff-box, be|gan to pity poor writers; hired a laced coat; and looked about him.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, he conde&s;cended to tell the town him|&s;elf, that he was a man of wit and learning, and folks pointed at him as he went along the &s;treets, &s;aying, <HI>That's</HI> HE.</P>
<P>He drew his pen for preferment; and waged &s;currilous warfare again&s;t all his betters, who were out of favour. He fought blu&s;hle&s;s, through the field of faction. He mangled the over|thrown, he de&s;poiled the departed of their ho|nours. VENALITY crowned his temples with a brazen frontlet; and trampling over the fal|len worthies, &s;he led him to the &s;hrine of SE|CRET SERVICES; where the <HI>Oracle</HI> a&s;&s;ured him protection and reward.</P>
<P>At that time, there were numbers to provide for, who had been true &s;ervants of his HONOUR; and for whom, when no more vacancies could be made, new places mu&s;t be contrived.</P>
<P>This was the captain's ca&s;e. He had the promi&s;e of being INSPECTOR GENERAL of the MILK OFFICE, within the bills of mortality;
<PB N="163" REF="181">to prevent &s;o whole&s;ome a commodity from a|dulteration.</P>
<P>The author of this &s;alutary &s;cheme was an Arabian; who came over here in Oliver's time, to get a patent for it; becau&s;e foreigners always are more &s;tudious for our good, and &s;tudy more for the benefit of this nation, than the Engli&s;h can do, or indeed dare do, for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But the Arabian was di&s;covered to be in the Tartar intere&s;t; becau&s;e he endeavoured to &s;ub|&s;titute mares milk in&s;tead of cows; to make us brew all our porter from oatmeal, and pre|tended to prove hor&s;e-fle&s;h more whole&s;ome than ROAST BEEF.</P>
<P>This project was thrown a&s;ide for &s;everal years, until particular contingencies occa&s;ioned it to be revived, as above mentioned; and all the proper attendants appointed, viz.</P>

<P>The multiplicity of friends, which &s;ome|body, or &s;omebody el&s;e had to oblige, procra&s;ti|nated the in&s;titution; which made Cannon, about the year 1746, relinqui&s;h all his in&s;pecto|rial hopes, and be contented with the head la|bour of an author, mantaining him&s;elf by the &s;weat of his brow, as poets, or pro&s;e people, &s;hould do.</P>
<P>During the winter &s;ea&s;on, he picks up a pret|ty living, with &s;everal more &s;uch &s;ubaltern genii, by putting together magazines, and memorandum books, penning murders, making rebu&s;es, and &s;inging &s;ongs for both parties, and writing in news-papers again&s;t the players.</P>
<P>Yet I mu&s;t do tho&s;e <HI>pro&s;e writers</HI> the ju&s;tice to declare, that they would not do &s;o if they could help it.</P>
<P>They acknowledge it is wrong, to prejudice the town again&s;t any performer; becau&s;e his bread may be lo&s;t by it.&mdash;What then?&mdash;they had rather all the world &s;hould &s;tarve than them&s;elves; and &s;tarve they mu&s;t, if their works did not go off; and they can only &s;end abu&s;e to market; well knowing, &s;currility is always &s;aleable; depraved appetites delight in

<HEAD>To the READER,</HEAD>
<P>IT is with reluctance that I agreed to fini&s;h the Memoirs of this Comedian; becau&s;e I am not in amity with any Theatrical Profe&s;&s;ors&mdash;having met with &s;evere u&s;age from the &s;uperiors of that Fraternity.</P>
<P>At the age of 19 I did a Tragedy, not acted it, I mean (for I was always above being a player) but wrote one; which had not the lea&s;t bank|ruptcy among the unities; and therefore I a&s;|&s;ured my&s;elf, I mu&s;t have great credit for my manufactory.</P>
<P>As to making intere&s;t, to have my tragedy re|commended; though I was told, it was the on|ly way to go to work; yet, being bigotted too much to the excellence of my piece, I de&s;pi&s;ed &s;uch advice; and was a&s;&s;ured, within my own
<PB N="166" REF="184">mind, that it would be put into rehear&s;al by the manager, upon his fir&s;t reading it.</P>
<P>But <HI>multa cadunt,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>However, by u&s;ing the &s;ame chandlers-&s;hop, I got acquainted with a young lady, who&s;e &s;i&s;ter was dre&s;&s;er to a very celebrated actre&s;s.</P>
<P>She invited me to drink tea with her &s;i&s;ter, the dre&s;&s;er, to whom I read my play; who approved of it mightily; becau&s;e, as &s;he ob&s;erved, there was not much dre&s;&s;ing in it.</P>
<P>I had the honour of being introduced to the lady, her mi&s;tre&s;s, who received me with pe|cular deportment; which, as Gil Blas ob&s;erves, mo&s;t of the ladies theatrical put on to &s;trangers, e&s;pecially if the vi&s;itors are foot people.</P>
<P>She &s;tared at me, when I came into her room, &s;o much, that I was prodigiou&s;ly out of coun|tenance (a fault, of which even detraction will deny I am often guilty.)</P>
<P>But recollecting it is the common look, which ladies bear, both on and off the &s;tage, when they conde&s;cended to SEE their inferiors, I be|gan to come to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>After I had been &s;urveyed, as much as &s;he thought it con&s;i&s;tent with her dignity, to ob|&s;erve me, &s;he tinkled a &s;ilver hand-bell; and, on the maid's entrance, the lady, in a mo&s;t delicate accent, ordered her &s;ervant to take the foot&s;tool, which the actre&s;s was then re&s;ting one foot upon,&mdash;carry it there, <HI>thus the lady pointing to the cor|ner of the room, ordered;</HI> put <HI>my</HI> foot&s;tool there; that the man <HI>(pointing to me)</HI> may &s;et upon it, and read his play to me, and bring my eau-de|luce, and my aether bottle.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="185">Then, in the mo&s;t engaging attitude, &s;he re|clined her&s;elf upon the couch, on which &s;he had before been &s;eated, and looked like one of tho&s;e fine figures at the print &s;hops, of Venus, or a Madona, or &s;ome &s;inging or dancing lady in a repo&s;e, And tho&s;e graving and etchings are done by &s;ome great man, or after &s;ome great man's manner, as we are told in the ca|talogues by <HI>auctioneers</HI> and <HI>picture-dealers,</HI> who have &s;uch univer&s;al capacities, it is impo&s;&s;ible for them to be mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>They are the load&s;tones of connoi&s;&s;eur&s;hip. The only judges of genius. Coun&s;ellors of ta&s;te. Determiners of merit. Interpreters of &s;cience; and leading-&s;trings, baits, bits, curbs, &s;purs, whips, wheels, levers, pullies, and primum mo|biles, for every lady and gentleman of fortune, who chu&s;e to be trammell'd into ta&s;te, and be ambled about as connoi&s;&s;eur's hobby-hor&s;es.</P>
<P>Before I had read a page of my play, the lady interrupted me, finding great fault with my tones, with my empha&s;is, and my accents.</P>
<P>Swinging her&s;elf off the couch, &s;he aro&s;e with a graceful dignity, becoming a Penelope; the gold fringe of her &s;lippers playing to her feet, her &s;ilk train &s;weeping along the carpet; then flouri&s;hing her white handkerchief, the lady &s;poke three or four &s;peeches of Cali&s;ta, to &s;how me how people ought to deliver tragedy. Af|ter that, when &s;he had again &s;eated her&s;elf, as &s;he looked into the lid of her patch-box, &s;he enquired if I had &s;een her play all her charac|ters, and which I liked her be&s;t in.</P>
<P>My reply was <HI>(for I had a hint given me, not to be &s;paring of compliments)</HI> that where every one
<PB N="168" REF="186">was excellent, it was impo&s;&s;ible to perceive an inferiority.</P>
<P>She &s;miled, with the utmo&s;t complacency, upon me; &s;he took my MSS. promi&s;ed me it <HI>&s;hould</HI> be done, and &s;uffered me, kneeling, to &s;a|lute the back of her hand, as I took my leave; but meeting at the door a per&s;on very richly dre&s;&s;ed, I was ordered to walk in again.</P>
<P>This vi&s;itor to the lady was in a velvet coat, embroidered; a gold ti&s;&s;ue wai&s;tcoat, embroi|dered; and every other part of his apparel equal|ly rich. I took particular notice of his watch chain, it was remarkably long, and as remark|ably filled; for I counted no le&s;s than ten vari|ous &s;eals, and toys in different &s;hapes, upon it.</P>
<P>The gentleman was a very eminent haber|da&s;her, and a great friend of the lady's, as I heard afterwards. He &s;tared at me al&s;o; full as much as I had been &s;tared at before&mdash;then turn|ing to the gentlewoman, he a&s;ked her, in very ill pronounced French, Who the Devil I was?</P>
<P>She replied, an author.</P>
<P>I thought &s;o, he replied, <HI>&s;till in French;</HI> and &s;wore a great oath, at the &s;ame time&mdash;I thought he was a &s;habby genius, of &s;ome &s;ort, or ano|ther&mdash;but now my angel we'll have &s;ome fun with this fellow, I ha'ant roa&s;ted a &s;cribbler a great while: for damn me, if the&s;e authors, not one in a hundred of um, have any thing to &s;ay to a gentleman as they &s;hould do; becau&s;e they are blockheads, and ought to be caned, kicked, or dragged through a hor&s;e-pond; for what bu&s;i|ne&s;s have they to think about their betters.</P>
<P>I would not di&s;cover to him or the lady, that what they &s;aid in French, was under&s;tood by
<PB N="169" REF="187">me; but allowed him to the length of his tether, without interruption; and he accordingly a&s;&s;um|ed all that contemptuous behaviour, that un|worthy in&s;olence, which the wearers of fine cloaths conceit they have a power to be&s;tow on the wearers of plain ones.</P>

<P>THE morning following the go&s;&s;ipping &s;cene. David and his lady, at breakfa&s;t, con&s;ulted together upon the mo&s;t proper methods for educating their &s;on and heir.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAVID.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be &s;ure, and indeed, my dear wife, I do &s;uppo&s;e you will &s;uckle the child your&s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> LLWHUDDWHYDD.</SPEAKER>
<P>You do? then, my dear, you are guilty of a very indelicate &s;uppo&s;ition. Are ladies of fa|&s;hion to turn wet-nur&s;es, and have their heads horridly di&s;tracted by the noi&s;e of the nur&s;ery, or vapoured to death with cradle-rockings? is it ta&s;te? &mdash; I a&s;k you, my dear, upon your ho|nour, is it ta&s;te, for <HI>me,</HI> who come of &s;uch a family as I am come from, to have a child dang|ling at my brea&s;t, as beggars carry their brats. Nay, is it for <HI>your</HI> honour, your wife &s;hould appear &s;o? you, who come of &s;o good a family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAVID.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, thank God; and good providence, I do come of the mo&s;t anciente&s;t family, that ever was born.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> LLWHUDDWHYDD.</SPEAKER>
<P>There, my dear, you mu&s;t be wrong; im|men&s;ely wrong, upon <HI>my</HI> honour.&mdash;<HI>Your</HI> family may be the more ancienter in England; but <HI>my</HI> family is from America; we were the ance&s;tors of five original nations of the SENEKAS, from whom came the CHIKASAS, from whom
<PB N="188" REF="206">came the CATAWAWS, from whom came the CHEROKEES.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAVID.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I tell you <HI>my</HI> family is the mo&s;t anciente&s;t in the world; ay, and in America to boot; for they did go into the Ark, as game-keepers to &s;quire Noah; and his wor&s;hip's &s;on did marry queen Winifred; and from whom came the Cadwalladers; and from whom came the Tudors; and from whom came the Llwhuyddwhuydds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>She</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, and from <HI>my</HI> family came the <HI>Cherokee,</HI> and the</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Both together.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Rikketis,</HI> and the <HI>Mohawks,</HI> and the <HI>Tomahawks.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>He.</SPEAKER>
<P>And from mine the <HI>ap Mor|gaus, ap Jenkins, ap Rice, ap Jones, ap</HI> &mdash;</P>
</SP>
<P>Then they rai&s;ed their voices at the &s;ame time, louder and louder, until out of breath, and black in the face, they &s;tood &s;peechle&s;s, &s;taring at one another, like a pair of pitted turkey|cocks.</P>
<P>The lady fir&s;t recovered, and giving her hu&s;|band a look, blended with &s;corn and reproach, that look, which fine women know &s;o well how to wear <HI>(beating a tatoo with her feet, and hitting the tea-&s;poon upon the edge of a &s;aucer)</HI> thus &s;he ad|dre&s;&s;ed him.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry, Sir, that I &s;hould &s;o far forget my&s;elf, as to contend with you about families. Upon my honour, I &s;hall, for the future, take care how I ever enter into any &s;uch arguments with you, and immediately fell into a violent fit of the &s;ullens.</P>
<P><HI>Had I but time to analy&s;e that di&s;temper, and point out the methods of cure, how happy &s;hould I
<PB N="189" REF="207">make many hu&s;bands? but a more intere&s;ting &s;cene pre&s;ents it&s;elf,</HI> viz.</P>
<P>David, kneeling at his wife's feet, mo&s;t pa|thetically begging her to be good to him, to &s;peak to him, to look at him, or let him take hold of her hand.</P>
<P>But all his addre&s;s was vain&mdash;vain, as the petition di&s;tre&s;s pre&s;ents; vain, as the hopes of wit; or preten&s;ions of undower'd beauty and virtue.</P>
<P>Mr. Llwhuddwhuydd was forced, before the preliminaries could be &s;igned, to give up (upon his knees) every original branch of his family, and allow, both lineally and collaterally, the &s;uperiority of his lady's ance&s;try.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. LLWHUDDWHUYDD.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg, my dear hu&s;band, now you'll ri&s;e, &mdash; I chu&s;e it&mdash;there's my hand, I offer it to you as a token, I don't take any thing ill,&mdash;I for|get and forgive; it is ta&s;te to do &s;o; and I'll &s;uffer death, before I would be impolite. But pray, hu&s;band, how will you have our child brought up?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAVID.</SPEAKER>
<P>He &s;hall be put to &s;chool, as &s;oon as he goes into breeches; and he &s;hall be kept at learning, Latin and Greek for 12 or 14 years, to be &s;ure; becau&s;e I will have him a great &s;cholar, and then I will bind him prentice&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. LLWHUDDWHUYDD.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, excu&s;e me&mdash;he may be a &s;cholar, in|deed; I am not again&s;t that; becau&s;e, perhaps one day, or another, &s;uch a thing may be ta&s;te. But I renounce his being 'prentice, there's &s;ome|thing &s;o vulgar in it, &mdash; no, let him go into the army. I am certain, that as you have carried
<PB N="190" REF="208">&s;uch a number of people of fa&s;hion, for &s;o many years; and as they are under great obligations to you, for the care you have always took of them, they would not deny you &s;uch a &s;mall favour, as to give your &s;on a commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAVID.</SPEAKER>
<P>But for all that, my dear, I would have him a &s;cholar: ay, he &s;hall be a genius too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. LLWHYDDWHUYDD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Mr. Llwhyddwhuydd, I &s;hall faint at the very name of a genius&mdash;my God! a ge|nius!&mdash;what &s;hall my elde&s;t &s;on, the hopes of two &s;uch families as ours, be made a genius? why, at be&s;t a genius can but be a jack of all trades; and as to his making his fortune by ge|nius; why, you may as well &s;ay, the &s;un &s;hines at midnight. Is not every genius de&s;pi&s;ed by the polite&s;t people; do not the per&s;ons of quali|ty call creatures &s;o out of contempt, my God! did you ever know any body of fa&s;hion a genius &mdash; no, Mr. Llwhuddwhuydd, in&s;tead of bringing your &s;on up a genius, let him be a gen|tleman; let him keep gentlemen company, not but, I mu&s;t &s;ay, if his genius could turn to po|litics&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAVID.</SPEAKER>
<P>And plea&s;e God &s;o it &s;hall; I will bind him 'prentice to a politician; and when he is out of his time, he can &s;et up for him&s;elf, and provide for his relations.</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> MISS SHRED <HI>and</HI> DOCTOR NOSTRUM.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mi&s;s</HI> SHRED.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear creatures, excu&s;e me coming in &s;o &s;ud|denly&mdash;but I promi&s;ed, you know, la&s;t night, to bring a great phy&s;ician, and my friend, to prevent your &s;on, Mr. David, ever feeling any
<PB N="191" REF="209">pain, or being in any danger, while he was cut|ting his teeth&mdash;give me leave, therefore, to in|troduce the only man in the world, that has any &s;ort of &s;kill, to you,&mdash;he knows more than the whole college of doctors put together; and they envy'd him&mdash;&s;o they wou'dn' give him his de|grees without his undergoing an examination&mdash;but he was above that; therefore he went down to Edinburgh&mdash;there they knew better&mdash;he had his certificate &s;igned at once, and now he prac|tices here, in &s;pite of all the London doctors&mdash;and what is very wonderful, he took phy&s;ick en|tirely out of his own head, for he never was brought up to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAVID.</SPEAKER>
<P>No.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOCTOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir, I di&s;covered it all my&s;elf&mdash;I &s;corn'd to be taught. I de&s;pi&s;e all the fellows of the fa|culty, they are ignorant pretenders, I have a genius above them all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAVID:</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Ay, that's the thing&mdash;a genius&mdash;for a genius is above all learning, look you, as much as God is above the Devil, ble&s;s us!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOCTOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ladies, let me beg your attention, while I plainly demon&s;trate to you the nature of chil|drens teeth-cutting.</P>
<P>Hyppocrates and Cel&s;us declare, infants are &s;ubject to the aphthae, phobo&iuml;, diarrhaeas and pa|roxy&s;ms upon cutting their canine teeth. Her|nius tells us of inflammatory ton&s;ils, tumours of the parotid glands, or &s;aturia&s;moi, which may be, I think, the achor. &mdash; Now Aetius &s;ays,&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="192" REF="210">
<SPEAKER>DAVID.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never mind what Mr. Aetius &s;ays, Sir, no more than an cracked chair-pole; for you do &s;ay &s;uch fine things your&s;elf about Hyppocrates, that I would give all I was worth in the world, if I could but talk &s;o learnedly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOCTOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>This lady's&mdash; <STAGE>(pulling a phial out of his pocket)</STAGE> this is the MAGNETICA TINCTURA SACRA; the LOADSTONE ELIXIR; or ANODYNE SPECIFIC. With this, if you wa&s;h the infant's feet, it will attract all the morbid, foul and peccant humours from the child's head, and your &s;on &s;hall cut his teeth as ea&s;ily&mdash;as&mdash;as&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAVID.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, it &s;tands to rea&s;on, as ea&s;y as I can cut an onion&mdash;it mu&s;t&mdash;I have read about load|&s;tones&mdash;and my magazines do tell me about Sir I&s;aac Newton's attraction. Yes, yes, well God help me, I have &s;tudied and &s;tudied a great deal, yet never can be a great man, becau&s;e, doctor, I have not a genius.</P>
</SP>
<P>Which ob&s;ervation we beg the reader will memento, and endeavour to become a genius; it is a &s;ure and certain e&s;tate to him; as for ex|ample, this doctor No&s;trum, to whom, and the re&s;t of the No&s;trumi&s;ts, who, without under|&s;tanding or experience, education or capacity, &s;o publickly adverti&s;e, and vend their unwhole|&s;ome compo&s;itions to the detriment of the credu|lous multitude, and reproach of tho&s;e, who have power to prevent &s;uch &s;candalous impo&s;tors.</P>
