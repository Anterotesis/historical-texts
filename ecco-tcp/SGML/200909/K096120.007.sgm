<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Of their Di&s;po&s;ition, Amu&s;ements, Manners, and Method of Travelling.</HEAD>
<P>THE coldne&s;s of the climate, and the &s;harpne&s;s of the air, naturally gives the hordes good health and a vigorous con&s;titution; and this confirmed, by a hardy education, coar&s;e fare, &amp;c. qualifies them for any difficulties they may have to encounter, and makes them good &s;oldiers; but, at the &s;ame time, cramps their activity and renders them indolent and aver&s;e to &s;tudy. There are certainly among them, learned, able, and great men; but this &s;eems not to be the general talent of this nation, they being more apt to &s;it down with &s;uperficial acqui&s;itions, than to acquire &s;cientific know|ledge, by &s;tudy.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="5">The nobility and gentry mo&s;tly apply them&s;elves to a military life, in which they are more renowned for courage and enduring fatigue and hard&s;hips, than for &s;tratagem and intrigue. They have a graceful deportment, value much their own con&s;equence, make the be&s;t appearance they can; and, to gain the re&s;pect of others, are more expen&s;ive in the number of attendants, &s;umptuous hou&s;es, co&s;tly apparel, and well-furni&s;hed tables, than in other le&s;s noticed occa&s;ions. They never de&s;cend to any employ|ments in the church, law, phy&s;ic, or trade, and though, to gain experience in maritime affairs, they will &s;ubmit to the lowe&s;t offices abroad, yet, at home, no gentleman will accept the command of a merchant-&s;hip. The burghers are not very intelligent in trade, nor able to do their bu&s;ine&s;s, without credit from abroad; rather inclined to impo&s;e on tho&s;e they can over-reach, than follow their calling in a fair way. The pea&s;ants, when &s;ober, for they are much addicted to drinking &s;pirituous liquors, are very ob&s;equious and re&s;pectful, but drink makes them mad and ungovernable; mo&s;t of them live in a very poor condition, and are taught, by nece&s;&s;ity, to practice &s;everal arts in a rude manner; as making their &s;hoes, cloaths, &amp;c. the &s;everal in&s;truments of hu&s;bandry, and other nece&s;&s;aries which they cannot afford to buy; and to keep them to this, no more than one taylor, or &s;uch other handicraft&s;man is permitted to dwell in the &s;ame pari&s;h, be it ever &s;o large; and many of them are more than 20 miles in circuit.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="6">They are a people by no means dull of apprehen&s;ion; have no phlegm in their characters; are chearful, but not like noi&s;y and bu&s;tling people, that laugh one mo|ment and are dejected the next. They have not quite the vivacity of the French, but, on the whole, as much as the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>It may, in general, be &s;aid of the whole nation, that they are a people very religious in their way, and con|&s;tant frequenters of the church, that they are eminently loyal, and affected to monarchy; grave even to formality, much more out of nece&s;&s;ity than principles of temperance; apt to entertain &s;u&s;picions, and to envy each other as well as &s;trangers; more inclined to pilfering and &s;uch &s;ecret frauds than open violences, as breaking into hou&s;es, or highway-robberies; crimes as rarely com|mitted in this, as in any country whatever.</P>
<P>In matters of trade, they more ea&s;ily do the drudgery, than dive into the my&s;tery either of commerce or manu|factures, in which they u&s;ually &s;et up for ma&s;ters before they are half-taught; &s;o that in all things that require ingenuity, neatne&s;s, and dexterity, they are forced to apply to &s;trangers.</P>
<P>The manners of all ranks of people in Sweden are very engaging. The &s;uperior cla&s;&s;es have an ea&s;y, natural politene&s;s, which prejudices you in their favour at fir&s;t acquaintance. They have not a &s;wift, or
<PB N="4" REF="7">
formal, nor pert, or foppi&s;h, but a plain, ea&s;y carriage and manner, the re&s;ult of good &s;en&s;e and humanity. Their conver&s;ation is agreeable, paying great attention to foreigners, without troubling them with national cu&s;toms and ceremonies. Duels are not common, yet the men have very ju&s;t ideas of honour, and are as un|willing to put up affronts, as more tenacious and quarrel-&s;ome nations: and with re&s;pect to the pea&s;antry, they are a quiet, inoffen&s;ive, happy, and contented people. There are few cottages in Sweden that have not lands annexed to them, from 20 to 30 acres, and the pro|duce of this land, as their wives and daughters are employed in hu&s;bandry, enables them to be better clothed and make a better appearance than the pea&s;antry of England.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Coxe,</HI> who has given us &s;uch in&s;lated accounts of the politene&s;s and ho&s;pitality of the Poli&s;h and Ru&s;&s;ian gentry, tells us, that the Swedi&s;h nobility are equally &s;o, although with much le&s;s magnificence and expence in their hou&s;es, retinue, and entertainments; which ari&s;es from a circum&s;tance that mu&s;t give plea&s;ure to every friend of humanity. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of land not being in this country, as in Poland and Ru&s;&s;ia, appropriated to any particular de&s;cription of men; property is more equally diffu&s;ed, and &s;uch va&s;t accumulations of wealth, or ex|tent of domains, do not centre in the hands of a few grandees.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="8">The &s;ports and exerci&s;es peculiar to the Swedes and other Northern nations, are their running races on &s;ledges, and &s;ailing in yachts, upon the ice; in which they will turn and alter their cour&s;e, &s;ailing with in|credible &s;wiftne&s;s, much beyond any ve&s;&s;el in the water, and with much le&s;s danger of over&s;etting.</P>
<P>Mu&s;ic is e&s;teemed one of the polite accompli&s;hments among the ladies; it is, indeed, almo&s;t a general &s;cience in this country. Many of their mu&s;ic-ma&s;ters are held in high repute; and this vocation is thought &s;o honour|able, as to introduce them to all a&s;&s;emblies, with per&s;ons of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>Among the highlanders, the &s;hepherde&s;&s;es blow a kind of long trumpet, made of birch-bark, and called in the Swedi&s;h language, <HI>Lur.</HI> This mu&s;ical in&s;trument is &s;ome|times four yards in length, has a &s;trong and &s;harp &s;ound, and, in calm weather, can be heard at the di&s;tance of four or five miles. It is generally u&s;ed in the woods and mountains, to frighten away wild bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>The court at Stockholm is not very brilliant, owing probably to the circum&s;cribed revenue of the crown. Both King and Queen wear the national dre&s;s, and at the drawing-room, his Maje&s;ty, according to etiquette, &s;alutes every &s;enator's lady. After the King and Queen have paid their compliments to the company, they retire with part of it to an adjacent apartment, and play
<PB N="6" REF="9">
with them at <HI>Trente et quarente,</HI> or <HI>Ombre.</HI> About nine, they withdraw to a public &s;upper. Oppo&s;ite to their Maje&s;ties, at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the lower end of the table, ranges of tabourets or &s;tools are placed for &s;ena|tors' and amba&s;&s;adors' wives, no other ladies being per|mitted to &s;it; &s;o that none below tho&s;e ranks can make their appearance at the&s;e entertainments. A &s;enator here is a privy-coun&s;ellor, of which their are 18. During &s;upper the King and Queen talk with the nobility and foreign mini&s;ters who &s;tand near them.</P>
<P>The way of dividing the re&s;idence of winter and &s;ummer, as practi&s;ed in England, takes place here but in part. Many of the nobility, and riche&s;t of the gentry, re&s;ide the whole year at Stockholm, &s;carce ever &s;eeing their e&s;tates; others live entirely in the country, &s;eldom, if ever, vi&s;iting the capital: &s;ome, however, have hou&s;es at Stockholm, for the winter &s;ea&s;on, having a very good hou&s;e for their &s;ummer-re&s;idence in the country, decorated with gardens and plantations.</P>
<P>The ordinary &s;alutation of the Swedes is bowing to each other, as in England; but the inhabitants of the northern parts take hold of your right hand, and lay it over their left, making &s;trange faces at the &s;ame time. They are immoderately fond of &s;pirituous liquors; quaff their pipes after meals, and pu&s;h the bottle about, pretty bri&s;kly.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="10">It is the etiquette of the country to &s;alute the hand of every lady you are introduced to, but never the cheek, though the men frequently &s;alute the cheek of each other. Mr. <HI>Wraxhall</HI> gives us an intere&s;ting account of an embarra&s;&s;ment he laboured under from this etiquette, he was unaccu&s;tomed to in England. Having been ad|mitted frequently into the company of an enchanting, young lady of 20 years of age, with whom he was exceedingly &s;mitten, he longed much to &s;alute her, but knew not how to bring it about; for though a lover or an acquaintance may here take the mo&s;t unbounded familia|rity with the hand of his mi&s;tre&s;s, which he may ki&s;s, &s;queeze, pre&s;s, or do with, almo&s;t whatever he has a mind, yet her lips, nay her very cheek is a palladium, which &s;he guards with unremitting vigilance, and to which neither eloquence or &s;ubtlety can u&s;ually procure him any acce&s;s. He was re&s;olved however to try whether he could not &s;urmount this vexatious ob&s;tacle, and attain one conque&s;t over this tyranny of pre&s;cription. Con|vinced that no addre&s;s, no contrivance could avail him, without the additional face of authority and example to influence her, he bethought him&s;elf of a &s;tratagem, and had already bound his brows with the myrtles he was certain he &s;hould gather. "When I bade," &s;ays he, "the whole company adieu, I began with the mi&s;tre&s;s of the man&s;ion, an old lady of 60, who was the aunt of this young lady, and the widow of an Engli&s;h gen|tleman, and returning her my warme&s;t acknowledge|ments for her friend&s;hip and ho&s;pitality, bowed mo&s;t
<PB N="8" REF="11">
re&s;pectfully on her hand, which &s;he gave me to &s;alute. And now, Madam, &s;aid I, in Engli&s;h, I &s;hall take leave of you in the Engli&s;h &s;tyle, I am &s;ure you have no objection. So &s;aying, I put my arms about her neck, and ki&s;&s;ed her cheek. She was plea&s;ed with my gallantry, and &s;aid to me, laughingly, "Go and &s;erve Charlotte &s;o." I ad|vanced, elate with joy, and throwing into my at|titude and countenance the utmo&s;t humility and &s;uppli|cation, a&s;ked if I might not a&s;pire to &s;uch an honour. I &s;hould not, however, have waited for an explicit con|&s;ent, and was ju&s;t going to reap the fruit of my intrigue and labour, when &s;he, &s;tepping back ha&s;tily two paces, laid her hand on her brea&s;t, with an air which implied more than any words could have done, and throwing a look at me of &s;urprize and refu&s;al, <HI>Mon&s;ieur,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>Il faut &s;ouv nir que je &s;uis Swedoi&s;e.</HI>&mdash;She needed not to be more minute or firm in her determination; I &s;aw that I had undertaken an enterprize above my capacity, and had only to endeavour to retire with honour. I di&s;|dained all approach to violence, and was re&s;olved, that what I could not receive from her own con&s;ent, I would never attempt to &s;eize by compul&s;ion. Her hand &s;he tendered me, and, making a virtue of nece&s;&s;ity, I im|printed on it a cold ki&s;s, and bade her farewell. She at|tended me to the gate, and followed me with her eyes, whil&s;t the carriage was in &s;ight."</P>
<P>Marriages in Sweden are totally governed by the will of the parents, and founded &s;o much upon intere&s;t, that the inclination of the parties is little regarded, nor is the
<PB N="9" REF="12">
nation much troubled with the extravagance of lovers. A &s;tolen match is &s;carce heard of in an age, nor can the church give licence to marry, without publication of banns. Per&s;ons of condition of both &s;exes are &s;eldom married, till they are 30 years of age; becau&s;e, per|haps, their parents cannot afford to make them a &s;ettle|ment &s;uitable to their rank, and, of cour&s;e, the young couple is not in a &s;ituation to maintain a family, till the death of relations or advancement in life enables them &s;o to do. The women are, in general, more eminent for cha&s;tity before marriage, than fidelity afterwards. They are very fruitful, and &s;eldom fail of a numerous i&s;&s;ue. Among the common people, the wife hath much the wor&s;t of it, being put to all the drudgery without doors as well as within, and looks upon her&s;elf rather in the light of a &s;ervant, than that of a wife.</P>
<P>Dome&s;tic quarrels, of cour&s;e, rarely happen, hu&s;bands being as apt to keep the authority in their own hands, as the wives by nature, cu&s;tom, or nece&s;&s;ity, are inclined to be obedient. Divorces and &s;eparations &s;carce ever occur, but among the lower cla&s;s of people, where the innocent party is permitted to marry again. Cou&s;in-germans cannot marry without the King's di&s;pen&s;ation, which is more frequently granted than refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>In wedding-entertainments they have even affected pomp and &s;uper&s;luity beyond their circum&s;tances; and
<PB N="10" REF="13">
often, by the exce&s;s of this one day, many have involved them&s;elves for years.</P>
<P>The &s;ame is ob&s;ervable in their funeral-&s;olemnities, which are u&s;ually accompanied with more jollity and fea&s;ting then becomes the occa&s;ion. And, that they may have more time to make preparations, it is not uncu&s;|tomary to convey the corps to &s;ome vault in or near the church, where it &s;hall remain unburied for months, and &s;ometimes for years, rather than di&s;grace the family by an ordinary funeral. This was more, however, the practice of the la&s;t age than the pre&s;ent; the&s;e and other unnece&s;&s;ary expences beginning to be laid a&s;ide, in conformity to the frugality of the court, and in compliance with their for|tunes, which have been much reduced by taxes and the re&s;umption of great part of their e&s;tates by the Crown on one pretence or other.</P>
<P>By the laws of Sweden, the father's e&s;tate, whether hereditary or acquired, is divided among his children; every &s;on having an equal &s;hare in it, and a daughter half as much as the &s;on. Nor can the father give a greater &s;hare to one more than another; unle&s;s he can obtain the concurrence of a court of law, through the undutifulne&s;s of any of his children; in which ca&s;e he can only beque<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th one tenth of his acquired property to &s;uch child as h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hall think proper. This al&s;o reduces the fortune of individuals.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="14">Travelling in Sweden is perfectly commodious to one acquainted with the u&s;ual method of procuring hor&s;es. At the different towns and villages upon the high roads, po&s;t-hor&s;es are not always regularly &s;tationed; but if the traveller &s;ends forward to a pea&s;ant to appoint relays, at a certain, &s;tipulated place and time, his orders are punctually executed. The u&s;ual practice of &s;upplying po&s;t-hor&s;es is regulated in a manner very convenient and cheap to travellers, yet extremely burthen&s;ome to the natives. All per&s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing land of a certain tenure, are bound to &s;end one or more hor&s;es, two or three times in the month, to the neighbouring po&s;t-hou&s;e; if they are not wanted, they return, after waiting 24 hours, without any compen&s;ation for their labour and lo&s;s of time, and if employed, receive a very inadequate recompence. 32 &s;tivers or 10<HI>d.</HI> Engli&s;h, being only paid in the towns for each hor&s;e, for a Swedi&s;h mile, equal to two leagues Engli&s;h, and half the above &s;um for a mile, in the villages; which is not more than one penny, or one penny half-penny &s;terling, for each hor&s;e, per Engli&s;h mile. Mr. <HI>Coxe</HI> &s;ays, that for the di&s;tance of 500 miles, from Stockholm to Carl&s;erone, his whole expence, including the prime co&s;t of his cart, (which is the common travelling machine in this country, with two armed chairs fixed on with &s;prings) the hire of po&s;t-hor&s;es, gratuities to drivers, and accommodations on the road, did not amount to 20<HI>l.</HI> Engli&s;h, though his Swedi&s;h &s;ervant occa&s;ionally taxed him with want of oeconomy. The drivers, being the pea&s;ants them&s;elves, who u&s;ually attend with their own hor&s;es,
<PB N="12" REF="15">
are contented with a &s;mall acknowledgement of 2<HI>d.</HI> and 3<HI>d.</HI> for each po&s;t.</P>
<P>One po&s;t, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Coxe,</HI> I was driven by a pea&s;ant's daughter, and as the roads were, in many parts, exceed|ingly &s;teep, it required &s;ome &s;trength, and much dex|terity, to direct the hor&s;es and prevent the carriage from being overturned, their harne&s;s con&s;i&s;ting only of ropes tied together. I propo&s;ed that my &s;ervant, who was an expert driver, &s;hould take the reins; the girl, being offended at my que&s;tioning her &s;kill, peremptorily re|jected my propo&s;al, and placing her&s;elf in the po&s;tillion's &s;eat, drove off, at full &s;peed, governing the hor&s;es in &s;uch a &s;kilful manner, that &s;he &s;oon quieted my apprehen&s;ions, and we arrived at the end of the po&s;t, without the &s;lighte&s;t alarm; no was I, in future, in the lea&s;t, apprehen&s;ive of tru&s;ting my&s;elf to the guidance of a Swedi&s;h, country girl. The hor&s;es here are &s;mall, about 3<HI>l.</HI> Engli&s;h in value each, but lively and active; two were u&s;ually the compliment for my cart, and they went generally at the rate of &s;ix or &s;even miles an hour; the po&s;tillion never rode, but &s;at upon a &s;mall bench at the extremity of the cart. When more than two hor&s;es are harne&s;&s;ed to a carriage, they are all abrea&s;t.</P>
<P>To prevent per&s;ons from being detained from the wilful negligence of tho&s;e who are obliged to furni&s;h hor&s;es; each traveller &s;igns a book, which is kept for that pur|po&s;e, noting in this book, how long he had been retarded by their neglect. This book is produced at every
<PB N="13" REF="16">
quarterly meeting of the magi&s;trates, when the offender is puni&s;hed, according to his de&s;erts.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering the many rocks and rugged mountains in this country, the highways are better than can be ima|gined; they are plained and made ea&s;y by the pea&s;ants, who receive their orders from the governors of the re|&s;pective provinces, from time to time, and obey them punctually; in&s;omuch, that <HI>Motraye</HI> ob&s;erves, there are &s;carce better ways in any country in Europe, nor is there a place where a man travels with more &s;ecurity and le&s;s charge; but out of the great roads there are very poor accommodations. The high roads in Sweden wind agreeably through the country, are made with &s;tone or gravel, and are as good as our turnpikes in England, and yet not a &s;ingle toll is exacted from the traveller. Each landholder is obliged to keep a certain part of the road good, in proportion to his property; and for the purpo&s;e of a&s;certaining their re&s;pective portions, &s;mall pieces of wood, or &s;tone, numbered, are fixed at different di&s;tances, on each &s;ide of the way.</P>
<P>Though we have no great rea&s;on, &s;ays <HI>Con&s;et,</HI> to com|plain in England of our turnpike roads, yet, nothing with us is to be compared with the&s;e. Swamps, mora&s;&s;es, &amp;c. are all made equally good, and their fine woods and gravel-roads, have &s;o beautiful an effect, that the traveller might frequently &s;uppo&s;e him&s;elf entering the avenue or approach to &s;ome great man&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="17">When you leave the&s;e high roads, the &s;tages are long, and though you meet with much civility, the accommo|dations are but indifferent. If your wine is carried with you, and you have your own hor&s;es and attendants, and can ride the whole journey, every pea&s;ant's hou&s;e is open to you, and with the utmo&s;t ho&s;pitality; and they will, for very tri&s;ling rewards, do whatever is in their power to &s;erve you; they will get you fi&s;h, wild fowl, and veni&s;on, excellent of the kind; with which you may load a hor&s;e, from place to place, and, as wine is ea&s;ily carried, this will remedy every inconvenience.</P>
<P>In winter-time, the mo&s;t expeditious way of travelling is in their &s;ledges, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e parts of the country which abound in lakes and rivers; for the&s;e being all frozen, there are no ob&s;tacles in their way, and a travel|ler may more readily carry provi&s;ions with him in a &s;ledge, than on hor&s;eback. And the want of the &s;un is &s;o well &s;upplied by the brightne&s;s of the &s;now and the clearne&s;s of the &s;ky, at this time of year, that travel|ling by night is, as I have ob&s;erved, as u&s;ual as in the day.</P>
<P>In pa&s;&s;ing from Stockholm to Finland, the Gulph of Bothnia is to be cro&s;&s;ed. This pa&s;&s;age in &s;ummer-time is in ve&s;&s;els, but, about 40 miles from Abo, where the Gulphs of Bothnia and Finland unite, this branch of the &s;ea, being frozen in winter, is cro&s;&s;ed in &s;ledges, and the road, on this frozen &s;urface, is marked out by two rows of &s;mall t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">es, placed upright in the ice, as a direction for travellers.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of their Trade, Manufactures, and Revenue.</HEAD>
<P>SWEDEN was, a long time, without any trade or com|merce, and formerly u&s;ed to be &s;upplied with foreign commodities by the Hans-towns, but, by the &s;tate of commerce laid before the diet in 1752, it appears that trade was making great advances. The exports from Sweden are iron, in bars and wrought, other wrought metals, timber, pitch, tar, pot-a&s;h, &s;alt-petre, gun|powder, cobalt, cordage, wooden ware, furs, Morocco leather, as it is called, and dried fi&s;h. The imports are grain, fle&s;h, bacon, chee&s;e, butter, tallow, &s;alt, wine, brandy, drugs, hides, hemp, flax, wool, &s;ilk, and &s;everal foreign manufactures. They now &s;tudy their commerce &s;o much, as to take pains to improve their agriculture and fi&s;heries, and employ none but Swedi&s;h bottoms, to carry on the trade of the kingdom.</P>
<P>The general direction of their trade belongs to the col|lege of commerce, which con&s;i&s;ts of the pre&s;ident of the trea&s;ury, and four coun&s;ellors, who hear cau&s;es of that nature, and redre&s;s any di&s;order that happens; and the bank of Stockholm is a great benefit to it.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="19">In 1731, an Ea&s;t India Company was e&s;tabli&s;hed; but this is no more than a &s;ociety of merchants, who &s;end annually two or three ve&s;&s;els to China; and in 1740, the herrings, which till then had never approached the we&s;tern &s;hore of Sweden, flocking in &s;hoals to that coa&s;t; the inhabitants of Gotheburg, or Gotenburg, e&s;tabli&s;hed a fi&s;hery, which has been attended with con&s;iderable ad|vantage. An Engli&s;h con&s;ul and &s;everal merchants of our nation here re&s;ide, and a chapel, with a regular chaplain, is appropriated to their &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Among the manufactures which they have been eager to e&s;tabli&s;h, is the woollen. They have made &s;ome progre&s;s in coar&s;e cloths, and begin to work &s;ome that are fine; an improvement which has been much owing to their gaining a better breed of &s;heep from England, and which, with much a&s;&s;iduity, has been di&s;per&s;ed over mo&s;t parts of the kingdom.</P>
<P>They have al&s;o &s;ome linen fabricks, in which are wrought both hemp and flax, but the&s;e are not nearly &s;ufficient to &s;upply their home-con&s;umption. Of gla&s;s and paper they import very little. Hardware is a con|&s;iderable article among them, not in the &s;tile of our Birmingham manufacture, but chiefly in the foundery way. They ca&s;t great quantities of cannon, and export them; al&s;o balls in great number, and many other articles. They are unrivalled in their iron and copper-mines, which are far more con&s;iderable than tho&s;e of any other
<PB N="17" REF="20">
country in Europe; &s;o that they apply copper to mo&s;t of the purpo&s;es that we do lead, in England, &s;uch as roofing of churches and other buildings. Holland and France are their be&s;t cu&s;tomers, but no country pays them &s;o much in money as England. In iron and timber we pay them a balance of &s;ome hundred thou&s;and pounds annually. The pea&s;ants are chiefly employed in the manufacture of iron and copper, and mo&s;t forges of iron employ from four to 1400 workmen each. Through|out the country there are many of the&s;e forges, and no Cyclops were ever more dexterous in working their materials. I have &s;een them, &s;ays <HI>Wraxhall,</HI> &s;tand clo&s;e to, and hammer in their coar&s;e frocks of linen, a bar of ore, as I have before ob&s;erved the heat and refulgence of which were almo&s;t in&s;upportable to me at ten feet di&s;tance, and with the &s;parks of which they were covered from head to foot.</P>
<P>Building &s;hips for foreigners is al&s;o a trade among them, and encouraged by government, and they go fair to underfell the Engli&s;h and Dutch in &s;hip-building, by many <HI>per cent.</HI></P>
<P>The revenue of Sweden is but &s;mall; not above 1,200,000<HI>l.</HI> a year, nor has it been improved for many years. It ari&s;es either out of the deme&s;ne lands of the crown, from the cu&s;toms, the coin, copper and &s;ilver mines, tythes which the crown &s;eized at the Reformation,
<PB N="18" REF="21">
and were before appropriated to bi&s;hopricks and mona&s;|teries, poll-tax, fines, &s;tamped paper, and other duties. Of money, they have &s;ome gold and &s;ilver pieces, but the&s;e are very &s;carce, they having many years &s;ince been called in, and the holders of them obliged to exchange them for copper pieces, on which the king &s;tamped an ima|ginary value. They have al&s;o bank-notes, &s;o low as one &s;hilling and &s;ix-pence each, ri&s;ing gradually from that &s;um to very large amounts. It is often diverting to &s;ee them come loaded with copper-coin, to give change for a 50 dollar note, equal to 12<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> Engli&s;h; nor can they convert it into current ca&s;h by any other means. It is &s;aid that <HI>Corregio,</HI> the painter, caught the fever of which he died, by wheeling home, in a barrow, in a very hot day, the money he had received in payment for one of his pieces, the price having been laid down in copper. <HI>Corregio,</HI> however, was not a Swede; but the Swedes, till the invention of bank-paper, were accu&s;tomed to wheel about their money in barrows. An abundance of copper-coin may be &s;een al&s;o in other countries. In France, among the lower cla&s;s, &s;uch large &s;ums are often paid in copper, that trade&s;men will not be at the trouble of counting it, but pay it away, by weight.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Of their Language, Learning, and Religion.</HEAD>
<P>THE Swedi&s;h language, has &s;uch an affinity with the Dani&s;h and Norwegian dialects, that the inhabitants of the three kingdoms readily under&s;tand each other. But Finland and Lapland have dialects of their own; that of the Finlanders is quite different from mo&s;t of the other northern dialects, but like that of the Laplanders, with which its idiom perfectly agrees, it has a great affinity with the Hebrew.</P>
<P>In Pagan times, the Runic characters were in u&s;e here, as appears from the Runen&s;teine, or Runic &s;tones &s;et up near the &s;epulchres of the dead, which are &s;till to be &s;een in mo&s;t of the provinces. Per&s;ons of rank at pre&s;ent, &s;peak and write chiefly French and High Dutch.</P>
<P>The Swedi&s;h language has &s;o great a re&s;emblance to the Engli&s;h, that a quick Engli&s;h ear may readily com|prehend many expre&s;&s;ions in common conver&s;ation: The following phra&s;es for example: "Come let us go." &mdash;"Let us &s;ee."&mdash;"Stand &s;till."&mdash;"Hold your tongue." &mdash;"Go on."&mdash;Are thus written in the Swedi&s;h tongue:&mdash;<HI>"Kom let o&s;s go."&mdash;"Let o&s;s &s;e."&mdash;" Stand &s;till."&mdash;
<PB N="20" REF="23">
Hold din tunga.&mdash;Go an.</HI> But, they are generally pro|nounced more in the Scotch than the Engli&s;h accent; and Mr. <HI>Coxe</HI> &s;ays, it appeared to him as if the Swedes were talking broad Scotch. Nor is it any matter of wonder; for it is probable that the Scotti&s;h mode of &s;peaking is the &s;ame as was formerly u&s;ed in England; and that whil&s;t we have gradually &s;oftened our former pronunciation, the Scotch have retained it. With re&s;pect to the &s;imila|rity between the Swedi&s;h and the Engli&s;h, we may remark that they are both dialects of the Teutonic or German; and if, in the pronunciation, they re&s;emble more each other, than their original &s;tock, it is owing to this circum&s;tance; that we are certainly de&s;cended from the Swedes and Danes, who&s;e languages are only different dialects; and the old Saxon, which gave ri&s;e to the Engli&s;h, was probably fir&s;t introduced into our i&s;land by &s;ettlers, or invaders from the&s;e northern kingdoms. There are ob&s;olete, Engli&s;h words, very common in Scot|land; and that the &s;imilarity of the Engli&s;h and Swedi&s;h was greater formerly than at pre&s;ent, appears from the following anecdote taking from the Swedi&s;h hi&s;tory.</P>
<P><HI>Everinus</HI> was the fir&s;t Bi&s;hop, by birth an Engli&s;hman, he came, in 1026, into Sweden, at the reque&s;t of King <HI>Olaus Scotkonung,</HI> in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t in converting the natives of Old Up&s;ala to Chri&s;tianity. The &s;imilarity of the Engli&s;h and Swedi&s;h languages is mentioned as the motive that fir&s;t brought him, and afterwards &s;everal of his countrymen there as preachers of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="24">In Sweden, the nobility and gentry &s;eem to apply them|&s;elves more to the &s;tudy of arms than of arts, and to de&s;pi&s;e an academical education. It is the meane&s;t of the people who re&s;ort to their univer&s;ities to qualify them&s;elves for holy orders. The law al&s;o is a contempt|able profe&s;&s;ion, only taken up by tho&s;e who know not how otherwi&s;e to &s;ub&s;i&s;t; but per&s;ons of rank have lately exhibited &s;ome noble proofs of their munificence for the improvement of literature. They &s;ent <HI>Ha&s;elqui&s;t,</HI> the natural philo&s;opher, into the Ea&s;t for di&s;coveries; and Queen <HI>Chri&s;tina</HI> purcha&s;ed his collection of curio&s;ities. <HI>Puffendorf,</HI> that able civilian, &s;tate&s;man, and hi&s;torian, was a native of Sweden; and &s;o al&s;o was the late cele|brated <HI>Linnaeus,</HI> who carried certain branches of natural philo&s;ophy to the highe&s;t pitch; and, in the mid&s;t of the late di&s;tractions, the fine arts, drawing, &s;culpture, and architecture were encouraged and protected; and yet, according to Mr. <HI>Wraxhall,</HI> who made great enquiries on this head, the few arti&s;ts on which they lavi&s;h en|comiums are rather celebrated for their rarity than their greatne&s;s or lu&s;tre. The knowledge of agriculture, both in theory and practice, is here carried to a con&s;iderable height, and we apprehend the general characters of the Swedes being a dull and heavy people, is more owing to the want of opportunity of exerting their talents, than of not having talents to exert.</P>
<P>The public revenue and wealth of Sweden being inti|mately connected with the mines, particularly tho&s;e of
<PB N="22" REF="25">
iron, mineralogy has been eminently encouraged and cultivated in that kingdom. To this cau&s;e we may in a great mea&s;ure attribute the acknowledged &s;kill of the Swedi&s;h chymi&s;ts, as &s;uperior to tho&s;e of many other nations. The Swedes have no poets, &s;ome have at|tempted poetry in Latin, but have made nothing of it.</P>
<P>Sweden contains three univer&s;ities, Up&s;al, Lund, and Abo, and 12 &s;eminaries called <HI>Gymne&s;ia,</HI> for the educa|cation of youth, &s;ix of which are of royal foundation. In every large town there is al&s;o a &s;chool, maintained at the expence of the crown, in which boys generally con|tinue till they are 11 years old, when they are removed to the Gymne&s;ia, and thence, at about 16, to the univer&s;i|ties. In the Gymne&s;ia, and many of the greater &s;chools, the Greek, Latin, and Hebrew languages are taught, and the bi&s;hops, in their re&s;pective dioce&s;es, where they are obliged to re&s;ide, in&s;pect the&s;e &s;eminaries and &s;chools.</P>
<P>At the head of the univer&s;ity of Up&s;al is a chancellor, (always a man of high rank and con&s;equence) cho&s;en by the profe&s;&s;ors, and confirmed by the King. In his ab&s;ence the archbi&s;hop of Up&s;al acts for him. It has a court of ju&s;tice belonging to it, and has about 20 profe&s;&s;ors, who&s;e &s;alaries are from 70 <HI>l.</HI> to 100 <HI>l.</HI> a year.</P>
<P>Youth here do not inhabit any di&s;tinct colleges, as in our univer&s;ities, but lodge in the town, and attend the profe&s;&s;ors, who have in common no regular dre&s;s any
<PB N="23" REF="26">
more than the &s;tudents, but, on days of ceremony, wear a black &s;ilk cloak. Doctors of divinity are di&s;tingui&s;hed by a black &s;ilk hat; doctors of law by a white one, and tho&s;e of phy&s;ic by one of green or &s;ky blue. The average number of &s;tudents is about 500.</P>
<P>This univer&s;ity is certainly the fir&s;t &s;eminary of the north, for academical education, and has produced, from the time of its in&s;titution, per&s;ons eminent in every branch of &s;cience. The learned publications which have been given to the world by its members, &s;ufficiently prove the flouri&s;hing &s;tate of literature in this country. There are very few in&s;tances, &s;ays <HI>Mar&s;hall,</HI> of a young man under&s;tanding the dead languages, and not being, at the &s;ame time, ma&s;ter of two or three very u&s;eful, living ones, which is more than can be &s;aid of our youth in England.</P>
<P>The univer&s;ity-library contains many valuable books and manu&s;cripts, and among the mo&s;t valuable of the latter, is a copy of the four go&s;pels, &s;uppo&s;ed to be one of the Gothic tran&s;lations made by <HI>Ulphilas,</HI> the apo&s;tle of the Goths, in the fourth century: Mr. <HI>Coxe</HI> examined it, and &s;ays, it is a quarto volume, and the letters, all in capitals, painted in &s;ilver upon leaves, (whether of vellum, parchment, or papyrus, he knows not) &s;tained violet-colour. The initials of the words, and &s;ome few pa&s;&s;ages are painted in gold, in the &s;ame manner as in the fine&s;t, mi&s;&s;als. Mo&s;t of the golden characters are become green by time, but the &s;ilver letters are in good
<PB N="24" REF="27">
pre&s;ervation. This manu&s;cript was fir&s;t di&s;covered in 1597, in the library of the Benedictine abbey of Wer|den in We&s;tphalia; hence it was transferred to Prague, and thence &s;ent as a pre&s;ent, in 1648, by Count <HI>Ko|ningsmark</HI> to Queen <HI>Chri&s;tina</HI> of Sweden; by her it was given to <HI>I&s;aac Vo&s;&s;ius,</HI> the Dutchman; and on his death, was purcha&s;ed for about 250 <HI>l.</HI> by Count <HI>Magnus Gabriel de la Gard&iuml;e,</HI> and by him pre&s;ented to the univer&s;ity of Up&s;al. This copy, undoubtedly a tran&s;lation from the original Greek, is con&s;idered as a work of great autho|rity, and a literary trea&s;ure of high antiquity.</P>
<P>The two other univer&s;ities are on the &s;ame plan, but not &s;o numerous.</P>
<P>The Royal Society at Up&s;al is the olde&s;t, literary aca|demy of that kind in the north, and was in&s;tituted in 1720. They have al&s;o a Royal Academy of Sciences at Stockholm, and an academy for the Polite Arts at Drot|ningholm.</P>
<P>The e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of this country is Lutherani&s;m; the reformation as well as in Denmark and Norway, be|ginning &s;oon after the neighbouring parts of Germany had imbibed the tenets of <HI>Luther.</HI> All orders of men here agree in a con&s;tant attendance on divine &s;ervice, and a zeal for their own way, without any nice enquiries into di&s;putable points, either of their own faith, or that of other churches. They are &s;urprizingly uniform and
<PB N="25" REF="28">
unremitting in matters of religion, and they will &s;uffer the religious exerci&s;e of any di&s;&s;enting Prote&s;tants; and it is &s;aid have &s;uch an aver&s;ion to popery, that ca&s;tration is the fate of every Roman-catholic prie&s;t there di&s;covered; nay, they go &s;uch lengths, &s;ays <HI>Motraye,</HI> that they will not admit any di&s;&s;enter to re&s;ide among them; nor would they give a chaplain of the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador chri&s;tian burial, nor &s;uffer the Engli&s;h to read their funeral &s;ervice at the grave, though at that time, which was in 1720, the Engli&s;h fleet was their only &s;ecurity again&s;t the ravages of the Mu&s;covites. The Archbi&s;hop of Up&s;al was con|&s;ulted on this point, and went &s;o far as to prohibit the Swedi&s;h clergy a&s;&s;i&s;ting at the funeral, or carry him to the grave, as they do a departed brother.</P>
<P>But, notwith&s;tanding their great aver&s;ion to popery, we learn from <HI>Con&s;et,</HI> who was there in 1786, that with re&s;pect to outward &s;plendor, they adopt the Popi&s;h mode of wor&s;hip. The prie&s;t, in approaching the altar, puts on a rich embroidered cope, and officiates accord|ing to many Roman-catholic cu&s;toms. Above the altar-table, in St. Nicholas's church at Stockholm, is the a&s;cen&s;ion of our Saviour, repre&s;ented in &s;olid gold, inlaid with &s;ilver of mo&s;t exqui&s;ite workman&s;hip, and many crucifixes of &s;olid gold and &s;ilver about it. After &s;er|vice, rigid as they are in it, they go to plays, operas, and all kinds of amu&s;ements. They have mu&s;ic in their churches, and &s;uch as in&s;pires the mind with religious awe.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="29">The religion of Finland, and that of Lapland, is Lutheran.</P>
<P>The church is governed by an archbi&s;hop and 14 bi&s;hops, who are not troubled with the admini&s;tration of &s;ecular affairs, but are obliged to re&s;ide in their dioce&s;es, except at the meeting of the diet. Their revenues are very moderate, the archbi&s;hopric of Up&s;al not being more than 1000 <HI>l.</HI> a year; the bi&s;hopricks from 300 <HI>l.</HI> to 400 <HI>l.</HI> Under the bi&s;hops are three &s;uperin|tendants, with epi&s;copal powers and authority; the&s;e are the King's fir&s;t chaplain, the rector of St. Nicholas in Stockholm, and the fir&s;t chaplain of the navy. Over each 10 churches is a rural dean. The churches in Sweden and Finland are &s;hort in number of 2000, and the clergy, all together, do not exceed 4000, all the &s;ons of pea&s;ants, or mean burghers, who&s;e incomes are &s;mall, ari&s;ing from glebe-land, and one third of the tithes; the king having the other two.</P>
<P>The clergy of each dioce&s;e, on the death of their bi&s;hop, propo&s;e three per&s;ons to the King, and he no|minates one to &s;ucceed; the &s;ame in the choice of the &s;uperintendants; but on the election of the archbi&s;hop, all the chapters have a vote; the determination, however, is in the King. His Maje&s;ty has the patronage of mo&s;t churches, &s;ome few only being in the di&s;po&s;al of the nobility. Many of their churches are adorned with &s;culptures, painting, gilding, &amp;c. all are kept neat and
<PB N="27" REF="30">
clean, and furni&s;hed as well in country as city, with rich altar-cloths, copes, and other ve&s;tments.</P>
<P>Foreign mini&s;ters enjoy the free exerci&s;e of their reli|gion in their own families, but no one el&s;e. The chil|dren of &s;trangers mu&s;t be baptized by Lutheran mini&s;ters, and educated in their religion, or they have not the pri|vileges of Swedi&s;h &s;ubject.</P>
<P>If any Swedi&s;h &s;ubject changes his religion, he is bani&s;hed, and lo&s;es his property. If any one continues excommunicated above a year, he is impri&s;oned a month, fed on bread and water, and then bani&s;hed; and if any one brings into the country teachers of another religion, he is fined and bani&s;hed.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Of their Government, Forces, and Laws.</HEAD>
<P>THE form of the Swedi&s;h government has been often changed. Before the year 1772, &s;ays <HI>Coxe,</HI> it con&s;i&s;ted of 51 articles, all tending to abridge the power of the crown, and render the Swedi&s;h monarchy the mo&s;t limited in Europe; but in the revolution
<PB N="28" REF="31">
of 1772, the King threw off his &s;hackles, and by com|pul&s;ion made him&s;elf ab&s;olute ma&s;ter of his empire. The whole executive power is ve&s;ted in him; and though he has a &s;enate, or privy-council, con&s;i&s;ting of 18 members, with a &s;alary of 300 <HI>l.</HI> each, he is perfect ma&s;ter of that &s;enate, can appoint and remove all the members of it, and is not bound to follow their advice, further than he likes. He has the command both of army and navy, nominates to all civil offices, has the &s;ole power of con|vening and di&s;&s;olving the &s;tates, is not obliged to a&s;&s;emble them but when he plea&s;es, has rendered the taxes per|petual, enjoys a fixed revenue, and has the entire di&s;po&s;al of the public money; but though &s;uch are his peroga|tives, yet he has no power to enact or alter laws, rai&s;e money, declare war, or alter the coin, without the con&s;ent of the &s;tates, and if called upon by them, when convened, is obliged to account for the expenditure of the public money.</P>
<P>The diet, in which the &s;upreme authority re&s;ides, is compo&s;ed of the King and four e&s;tates of the people, convened in four hou&s;es. 1. the nobles; 2. the clergy; 3. the citizens; and 4. the pea&s;ants.</P>
<P N="1">1. The hou&s;e of nobles is divided into three; counts, barons, and untitled nobility. A family once enobled, continues &s;o throughout all its branches, and all have the &s;ame general privileges. The King can create new nobility, but in this he is limited in number. They
<PB N="29" REF="32">
mu&s;t not exceed in all 1350. The head of each noble family in the direct line, is, by birth, a member of this hou&s;e, and repre&s;ents his whole family. If he happens to be a &s;enator, it incapacitates him from a &s;eat in the hou&s;e of nobles, but he can transfer his &s;eat to another noble; and can vote by proxy. England is the only country in Europe, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Charles Sheridan,</HI> where the di&s;tinction of noble and not noble is carried no further than the nature of the government requires; becau&s;e there the nobility do not, as &s;uch, form a di&s;tinct cla&s;s from the re&s;t of the nation; it being only the head of each noble family, who is there entitled to the honours and privileges of the peerage: it is not the man who can count a long train of titled ance&s;tors, but the hereditary legi&s;lator, who is him&s;elf noble. The younger branches of noble families in England are &s;oon lo&s;t in the general ma&s;s of people; and thus become a link con|necting the intere&s;ts of the two cla&s;&s;es, and forming a chain, no part of which can be touched, without affect|ing, as it were, by an electrical communication, all the re&s;t. In countries where a per&s;on ennobled can tran&s;mit his honours to all his po&s;terity, there is no &s;uch link of connection, but on the contrary a line is drawn be|tween them to perpetuity, a line which cuts the chain of &s;ociety in two, the &s;evered ends of which appear rather to repel, than attract each other.</P>
<P N="2">2. The hou&s;e of the clergy con&s;i&s;ts of the 14 bi&s;hops, the archbi&s;hop at their head, and a certain number of

The hou&s;e of pea&s;ants con&s;i&s;ts of about 100 mem|bers, &s;uch as we &s;hould call yeomen; men who hold &s;mall farms of their own, or of the crown, and who cultivate &s;uch farms them&s;elves. This de&s;cription in|cludes only tho&s;e who&s;e ance&s;tors were al&s;o farmers, and does not entitle either nobles, citizens, or even country-gentlemen, though they may purcha&s;e the pea&s;ant's e&s;tate, either to vote or be returned a member. And it is &s;aid the King has made a late regulation, that none but &s;uch pea&s;ants &s;hall hold any office under government.</P>
<P>The con&s;tituents of each hou&s;e allow their repre&s;en|tatives a daily &s;um from 15<HI>s.</HI> Engli&s;h, to 5<HI>s.</HI> a day, during their attendance at the diet.</P>
<P>By the above mode of repre&s;entation we &s;ee, that the country-gentlemen, be their landed property ever &s;o large, are not repre&s;ented in the diet, have no vote for members, and cannot be cho&s;en them&s;elves; men uni|ver&s;ally allowed the mo&s;t re&s;pectable, and incorrupt part of the body politic, whil&s;t mechanics and farmers po&s;&s;e&s;s this important privilege.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="34">The &s;tates of the kingdom thus compo&s;ed, a&s;&s;emble at Stockholm; the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;tate, and the enaction of laws is carried on much the &s;ame as in our parliament in England. When the different hou&s;es have re&s;olved on any law, they attend the king in his palace, and go, in proce&s;&s;ion, from the &s;everal places in the city where they a&s;&s;emble. The town-guard turns out under arms as they pa&s;s. The fir&s;t noble, venerable in age, and dre&s;&s;ed in the court-fa&s;hion precedes; the re&s;t of the nobility walk in pairs; then the archbi&s;hop of Up&s;al, with a gold chain about his neck; the other bi&s;hops and clergy, two and two; next the chief magi&s;trate of Stockholm at the head of the burghers; and la&s;tly, the poor pea&s;ants, the &s;in|gularity of who&s;e apparel and lank hair, form a remarka|ble contra&s;t with tho&s;e of the other hou&s;es; but though appearances do not favour the&s;e people, they are far from being deficient in the politicks of their own coun|try; are firm in opinion; not to be bribed or bia&s;&s;ed, but adhere &s;trictly to the welfare and credit of their nation. The Swedes boa&s;t of having formed their diet on the model of the Engli&s;h parliament; if they did they have improved it; for it would be happy for this country, if we could boa&s;t of the &s;ame integrity.</P>
<P>The King's titles are King of the Goths and Vandals, great Prince of Finland, Duke of Schonem; Prince of Rugen, Lord of Ingermanland and Wi&s;mar, Prince Palatine the Rhine, Duke of Bavaria; Cleves, Bergen, Pomeran,
<PB N="32" REF="35">
&amp;c. and in this country there are three orders of knight-hood; the North Star, con&s;i&s;ting of 24 members; the order of Va&s;a, and that of the Sword, created at the la&s;t revolution.</P>
<P>Sweden had a greater extent of territory than at pre&s;ent. In the cour&s;e of this century it has lo&s;t Livonia, Ingermannland, and a con&s;iderable part of Fin|land; and the Ru&s;&s;ians are endeavouring to deprive it of the remainder of that country. It has lo&s;t al&s;o the duchy of Bremen, and particularly of Verden, the city of Stettin in Pomerania, and the di&s;tricts lying between the Oder and Pene, together with the i&s;lands of Wollin and U&s;edom, and the duchy of Deux Ponts. Of its former conque&s;ts it &s;till retains Bohus Lehn, a tract of land in Norway, part of Upper Pomerania, the i&s;land of Rugen, and the town of Wi&s;mar.</P>
<P>The Swedi&s;h army is divided into national militia, and regiments in garri&s;on. The latter are on the German footing, are compo&s;ed of natives and foreigners, pro|perly enli&s;ted and paid in money. The militia are fur|ni&s;hed by the &s;everal di&s;tricts of the kingdom. Each holder of a certain quantity of crown-land, called a <HI>Hemman,</HI> worth about 60<HI>l.</HI> a year, provides a &s;oldier, a&s;&s;igns for his maintenance a &s;mall portion of ground, a cottage, and a barn, and allows him 100 copper-dol|lars a year, that is, 1<HI>l.</HI> 7<HI>s.</HI> 8<HI>d.</HI> 3<HI>f.</HI> Engli&s;h; a &s;usit of coar&s;e cloaths, and two pair of &s;hoes. When this &s;ol|dier
<PB N="33" REF="36">
is on duty, the landholder cultivates his ground; but when he is not on duty, the landholder may call on him to work, at the rate of a common labourer, which is about 3<HI>d.</HI> Engli&s;h per day. On the death of a &s;oldier the ground and hou&s;e goes to his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. Of the cavalry, a man and a hor&s;e is furni&s;hed by a certain number of hemmans, and by them maintained. Each province being divided into a number of hemmans &s;uf|ficient to &s;upport a regiment; the &s;maller provinces furni&s;h the regiments of infantry, and the larger tho&s;e of cavalry. Each regiment, from 1000 to 1600 men, of which 96 are officers. The e&s;tate appropriated to the colonel by the King, as his pay, is in value about 300<HI>l.</HI> a year, lies in the center of the province, and of the ground a&s;&s;igned to his regiment; that of a captain, in the mid&s;t of tho&s;e belonging to his company; and in a &s;imilar gradation to the corporal, who&s;e allotment is 13, 899 &s;quare yards. In time of peace, they are called out to exerci&s;e three weeks in every year, at which time the landholder is obliged to tran&s;port the man and his baggage, and defray his expences during his &s;tay. They are al&s;o exerci&s;ed, in &s;mall parties, every Sunday after &s;ervice. If it be time of war, when the&s;e troops are marched out of the kingdom, the crown pays the men, and re|ceives the contribution, from the landholders. In 1779, the army con&s;i&s;ted of 12, 700 regular troops, and 34, 800 militia, in the whole 47, 500 men. The King's body|guard con&s;i&s;ts of a troop of halbardiers, and amounts to 136 men, who all rank as cornets.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="37"><HI>Mar&s;hal,</HI> who was there in 1770, &s;ays, the army was well-di&s;ciplined, and &s;ufficient for the defence of the kingdom, again&s;t any force that is likely to march again&s;t it, for that Sweden has nothing to fear but from Ru&s;&s;ia; but <HI>Con&s;et,</HI> who &s;aw an encampment of Swedi&s;h &s;oldiers in 1786, &s;ays, they made a very indifferent, military ap|pearance; from the awkwardne&s;s and apparent want of di&s;cipline, he took them for &s;ome new-rai&s;ed Lapland militia. He took a view al&s;o of the Swedi&s;h ordnance, which were then exerci&s;ing for a review; and &s;ays, it would be too humiliating to draw a compari&s;on between what he &s;aw and the Engli&s;h artillery. The &s;oldiers, in general, looked old and inactive; their regimentals are bad and unbecoming, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the officers, which are both whim&s;ical, gaudy, and ridiculou&s;ly orna|mented with ribbons, dyed feathers, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Wraxball</HI> was pre&s;ent at a review in 1774, and gives the following account of it. It was at Abo in Finland, in a large park, about an Engli&s;h mile without the gates of the city, a place, from its irregularity of ground, finely adapted for a martial entertainment. The ri&s;ing parts of it are covered with &s;mall woods of fir, and it is divided by a branch of die Lake Meler, over which is a floating bridge. The King of Sweden commanded about two regiments, mo&s;tly infantry; his younger brother had under him near 1000 troops, hor&s;e and foot. They were entirely ignorant of each others motions; his maje&s;ty only endea|vouring to &s;urround the inferior army, and the prince
<PB N="35" REF="38">
exerting his endeavours to effect a &s;ecure retreat. The King, dre&s;&s;ed in his uniform, was mounted on a cream-coloured hor&s;e, and appeared as much animated and in|tere&s;ted in this e&s;&s;ay of arms, as he could have been on a day of battle. It was about five in the evening, on the 21&s;t of June, when it began. I cannot pretend to pur|&s;ue the two generals, &s;ays he, through their different manoeuvres, which pa&s;&s;ed in too rapid a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and were of two intricate and uncertain a nature to admit of a minute de&s;cription. The re&s;ult was, however, favourable to the King; his brother having neglected to &s;eize on a po&s;t which might have commanded a retreat, found his error too late, and when he would have availed him&s;elf of this pa&s;&s;age, di&s;covered, that his rival troops were already in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, having cro&s;&s;ed the river in boats for that purpo&s;e. After having endeavoured, in vain, to force them from this po&s;t, he formed his infantry into a hollow &s;quare, and maintained a bri&s;k fire, on all &s;ides, for a con|&s;iderable time; but finding him&s;elf &s;urrounded by a much &s;uperior body of forces, and no po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;cape, he delivered up his &s;word to the King, and his &s;oldiers became pri&s;oners of war. His cavalry had, however, &s;eized on a &s;mall, but mo&s;t advantageous, &s;pot, and, unter|rified by the fate of their companions, refu&s;ed to &s;ur|render, and demanded permi&s;&s;ion to march off the ground with all military honours; and their fate was not decided when Mr. <HI>Wraxhall</HI> left die &s;pot, at 11 o'clock at night. It was, he &s;ays, a very elegant and gallant diver&s;ion, finely adapted to cultivate and practi&s;e the operations
<PB N="36" REF="39">
of a campaign, and keep alive the knowledge of war, even in the mid&s;t of profound peace.</P>
<P>Their principal magazines of arms are at Stockholm, and the ca&s;tle of Jioncoping, towards the confines of Den|mark. There are no fortified places in the heart of Sweden, except the ca&s;tle of Jioncoping, but there are &s;ome on the frontiers, particulaily in Finland.</P>
<P>Their rocks are a better defence then either walls or ba&s;tions; it is but guarding their pa&s;&s;es, and no enemy can penetrate far into their country. On the frontiers, to|wards Norway, there are &s;ome little forts, and the ca&s;tle of Bohus, &s;ituated on a rock in the mid&s;t of a deep river, a little above the city of Gothenburg, at the entrance of the Sound; with the town that lies upon the &s;ea, oppo&s;ite Denmark, and in one place is not more than four miles acro&s;s, are places of &s;trength. Carl&s;croon, where the royal navy is laid up, and Calmer upon the ea&s;tern coa&s;t, over again&s;t the i&s;land of Oeland are fortified; there are two &s;mall forts, at the entrance of the harbour of Stockholm, and on the north, they are &s;ufficiently covered by the &s;nowy mountains of Lapland.</P>
<P>The war-office, or college, has the direction of the military forces, &amp;c. An academy has been erected for in&s;tructing young gentleman in fortification, &amp;c. A college of invalids is founded, at Wad&s;tena, for 28 field-officers, 19 &s;ubalterns, and 22 privates, who are
<PB N="37" REF="40">
there provided with every nece&s;&s;ary. Be&s;ides the&s;e, above 500 field-officers, as many &s;ubalterns, and 4000 privates have pen&s;ions.</P>
<P>Sweden abounds in all kinds of naval &s;tores, and has a navy di&s;tributed in three ports, Carl&s;croon, Gottenburg, and Stockholm. The whole fleet, in 1779, con&s;i&s;ted of about 30 &s;hips of the line, including tho&s;e of 40 guns, and 15 frigates, be&s;ides galleys, prames, and xebecs; but, as &s;everal were out of repair, they could only be reckoned at 20 &s;hips of the line and 10 frigates.</P>
<P>The &s;eamen belonging to government are regi&s;tered, and amount to 18, 000; &s;ome of the&s;e receive pay in money, and others are &s;upported as the national militia, by &s;mall allotments of land, in the i&s;lands and on the &s;ea coa&s;ts. Of the&s;e 18, 000 &s;ailors, only 6000 are experi|enced &s;eamen, the re&s;t are mere pea&s;ants; but, in emer|gencies, the &s;ailors of merchantmen are pre&s;&s;ed, in ex|change for regi&s;tered &s;eamen.</P>
<P>Sweden is not only divided into counties and provinces, but the whole kingdom is again divided into 25 govern|ments, over each of which is placed a <HI>Land&s;hofding,</HI> or governor, like our lord-lieutenant and &s;heriff; to him the execution of the judicial &s;entences is committed, the collection of the revenue in his government, and the care of the fore&s;ts and crown-lands.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="41">The &s;upreme court of ju&s;tice, is a court of appeal, from other civil courts, where the matter in di&s;pute amounts to 70<HI>l.</HI> and upwards. There is a court under this, and in every corporation and di&s;trict, there is a court of ju&s;tice, with a &s;tanding or continued jury of 12 men, to decide all facts; and in every dioce&s;e they have an eccle&s;ia&s;tical court.</P>
<P>They have four, &s;uperior, national courts called <HI>Hof-Raett;</HI> one at Stockholm for Sweden proper, one at Lind|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">oping for Gothland, one at Abo for South Finland, and another at Va&s;a, for North Finland; and no &s;entence of death, pa&s;&s;ed by an inferior court, can be carried into execution, unle&s;s ratified by the&s;e tribunals.</P>
<P>The inferior tribunals are a kind of a&s;&s;izes, held three times a year, under the county judges, and the 12 &s;tand|ing jurymen are 12 pea&s;ants appointed for life, &s;even of whom form a court. The judge, in criminal ca&s;es, a&s;ks their opinion, but they are generally &s;o ignorant as to give a verdict agreeable to the opinion of the judge, and &s;o little are they thought of, that any man remarkable for his indolence and inattention is commonly &s;aid to be <HI>as &s;leepy as a juryman.</HI></P>
<P>Law-&s;uits, about property, are &s;oon decided, for all &s;ales and mortages of e&s;tates are regi&s;tered; nor is a law|&s;uit very expen&s;ive; the greate&s;t charge is their &s;tamped paper, on which the proce&s;s is written, from 2<HI>d.</HI> to 7<HI>s.</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="42">
a &s;heet, according to the value of the matter in di&s;pute. Every man may plead his own cau&s;e; no coun&s;el is ad|mitted; indeed, &s;o contemptible is the practice of the law, that no gentleman will undertake it.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual modes of execution are beheading and hang|ing; every capital convict may petition the King, and &s;o mild are the penal laws, that &s;everal offences which, in other countries, are con&s;idered as capital, are puni&s;hed here by whipping, never to exceed 120 &s;tripes; feeding on bread and water for 28 days; impri&s;onment and hard labour. Here is no torture; and all pro&s;ecutions for crimes are carried on at the public charge.</P>
<P>Duelling, where one of the parties is killed, is pu|ni&s;hed with the death of the &s;urvivor, and if neither fall, both &s;uffer two years impri&s;onment, pay a fine of 1000 crowns, and live the two years on bread and water. The national courts act as courts of honour, and when any one has received an affront, u&s;ually order the offending party to beg pardon pub|lickly.</P>

<P>I HAVE already &s;poken of Swedi&s;h Lapland in the fir&s;t volume of this work; but &s;hall take this opportunity of &s;aying, that &s;ince the plates were engraved for that volume, I have been able to a procure more accurate de&s;cription of the rein-deer, a drawing of which from life is given in the view of the entrance to the city of Up&s;al.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Con&s;et</HI> has al&s;o favoured us with the tran&s;lation of a Lapland &s;ong, which is pre&s;umed my readers will be plea&s;ed with. There are two elegant odes in N^o 366 and 406 of the <HI>Spectator;</HI> but they do not di&s;grace the following:
<Q><LG>
<L>The &s;nows are di&s;&s;olving on Tornao's rude &s;ide,</L>
<L>And the ice of Lulhea flows down the dark tide,</L>
<L>Thy dark &s;tream, oh Lulhea, flows freely away,</L>

<L>In youth let our bo&s;oms in extacy glow,</L>
<L>For the winter of life ne'er a tran&s;port can know.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>The accounts given by Mr. <HI>Coxe</HI> and <HI>Con&s;et,</HI> who were there lately, confirm tho&s;e we have already given, of cour&s;e, &s;hall refer my readers to them; ob&s;erving only with re&s;pect to the rein-deer, that they ca&s;trate them when young, that they are weak in the back, and cannot carry any great weight, that they can rarely draw more than one per&s;on in a &s;ledge, that they will travel almo&s;t the whole day without food, and that their common pace is about four miles an hour; if pre&s;&s;ed, they will go from 70 to 84 Engli&s;h miles a day, but &s;uch hard drawing generally de&s;troys them.</P>
<P>In the de&s;arts between Tornao and Cape Nord, <HI>M. Maupertuis</HI> tells us, that when he was there, in July, 1736, he was much tormented with great flies with green heads; that at this time of the year they are &s;o in&s;ufferable as to drive the Laplanders and their rein-deer from their habi|tations, to &s;eek &s;helter on the &s;ea-coa&s;ts. The&s;e flies fetch blood wherever they fix. At the foot of the moun|tain
<PB N="42" REF="45">
Horrila<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eo they were &s;till more mercile&s;s, and were not to be driven off with &s;moke, for the natives defend them&s;elves from the&s;e flies by great fires. The&s;e in&s;ects, continues he, poi&s;oned our victuals al&s;o; no &s;ooner was a di&s;h of meat &s;erved up, but it was covered with them, whil&s;t another &s;warm, with all the rapaciou&s;ne&s;s of birds of prey, were fluttering about, to carry off &s;ome pieces of mutton that were dre&s;&s;ing for us.</P>
<P>A word or two on their Lapland magic, and I have done. <HI>Motraye</HI> having &s;een a good deal of their tricks, &s;ays, if there is any &s;uch &s;cience as magic, it mu&s;t not be looked for among the Laplanders, who labour under the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ignorance. The magic a&s;cribed to the&s;e people, has ever been looked upon as &s;upernatural and diaboli|cal, though it appears to be nothing more than a feigned, enthu&s;ia&s;tic fit, accompanied with &s;ome &s;trokes on their drum, and other trifling ceremonies. <HI>Motraye</HI> thinks it may be &s;aid of the&s;e enchanters, as a famous phy&s;ician &s;aid of a woman who pretended to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; "much is owing to nature, more to de&s;ign; but nothing at all to the devil." When the Laplanders were fir&s;t &s;een at a di&s;tance, cloathed from head to foot in hairy &s;kins, it revived the antiquated fables of fawns and &s;atyrs, e&s;pe|cially as they &s;eemed to fly from tho&s;e who approached them, and might, with &s;ome propriety, be &s;aid to have wings upon their feet; for, with their wooden &s;kidders, they &s;kid over the &s;nows and ice, &s;wifter then the fleete&s;t hor&s;e can run, and, to this day, they fly from men they &s;ee
<PB N="43" REF="46">
in a &s;trange dre&s;s. How natural was it for per&s;ons then who fir&s;t vi&s;ited this country, though but moderately tinctured with &s;uper&s;tition, to look upon the natives as creatures of another &s;pecies; and with the additions which their fancies might create, as inhabitants of another world, or at lea&s;t conver&s;ant with tho&s;e of the lower regions; though, at this day, we find them to be men like our&s;elves, differing from us only in their habits, and &s;ome other circum&s;tances, occa&s;ioned by their &s;ituation, as the difference of the climate and &s;o on.</P>
<P>Though many princes and eccle&s;ia&s;tics have &s;hewn them&s;elves very zealous for the extirpation of witchcraft, and have, upon incompetent evidence, condemned &s;ome poor wretches to &s;uffer for this pretended crime; yet none could ever yet demon&s;trate that they entertained any commerce with the devil. There have been tho&s;e, who would have given them&s;elves to the devil, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, in hopes of finding their account in it, and have been convicted of the <HI>intention,</HI> but none of them ever &s;ucceeded in their de&s;ign. For exam|ple, Baron <HI>L&mdash;s,</HI> a Dani&s;h officer, who was in pri|&s;on &s;ome years &s;ince at Stockholm, on a charge of having &s;old him&s;elf by contract to the devil, on condition he would direct him how to procure a &s;um of money which he wanted, and to that end had, with his own blood, &s;igned a bond, by which he and &s;ome others of his ne|ce&s;&s;itous companions transferred their &s;ouls to Satan, after their death, on condition that he would be propitious to

them in this particular. But neither the baron, nor any of his friends finding any benefit by the conveyance they had made of them&s;elves to the old gentleman, though they went in the night to gibbets and burying-places, to invoke and treat with him on this head; one of them ob&s;erving that no voice was heard, or apparition ap|proached, to deliver them from their di&s;tre&s;s, determined to do for him&s;elf, what the devil would, or could, not do for him; and accordingly &s;oon after robbed and murdered a man, for which he was apprehended and executed; when he confe&s;&s;ed the arts they had u&s;ed, as above, to &s;upply their nece&s;&s;ities, and the original bond was found torn to pieces in Baron <HI>L&mdash;'s</HI> chamber.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of the Country, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IF we con&s;ider the extent of the dominions of the King of Denmark, we may reckon him one of the greate&s;t in Europe; but if we look to the importance and value of them, the kingdom may be con&s;idered as even le&s;s than Portugal.</P>
<P>His titles are King of Denmark and Norway, of the Goths and Vandals, Duke of Sle&s;wick and Hol&s;tein, Stormar and Ditmar&s;h, Earl in Oldenburgh and Delmenhur&s;t, all which countries he actually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, either in whole or in part; &s;o that except the title of the Goths and Vandals, equally enjoyed by the King of Sweden, and which the Crown of
<PB N="46" REF="50">
Denmark has retained ever &s;ince it was ma&s;ter of Sweden, (as we in England do that of France), all the re&s;t are &s;ub|&s;tantial titles.</P>
<P>Denmark is bounded on all &s;ides by the &s;ea, except one &s;mall neck of land, where it joins to Hol&s;tein. The Ger|man ocean wa&s;hes it on the we&s;t and north-we&s;t, the en|trance into the Baltic, called the Categate, on the north and north-ea&s;t; the Baltic on the ea&s;t, and river Eyder on the &s;outh, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the boundary of the Roman empire, and which having its &s;ource very near the ea&s;t &s;ea, takes its cour&s;e we&s;tward, and falls into the ocean at Toningten, a &s;trong town of the duke of Hol&s;tein Gottorp. So that if a canal was made about 12 Engli&s;h miles long, from this river to Kiel, it would be a perfect i&s;land; but in this account the duchy of Hol&s;tein is not included, one half of which belongs only to Denmark, and the other half to the Duke of Hol&s;tein Gottorp.</P>
<P>Such a canal is now almo&s;t completed, de&s;igned to form a junction between the Baltic and German ocean. From its beginning, to the deep water in the river Eyder, into which it opens, the di&s;tance is about 20 Engli&s;h miles. The expence of this cut, as it is under|taken by contract, is about 200,000<HI>l.</HI> The breadth of the canal at top is 100 feet, at bottom 54 feet, the lowe&s;t depth of water 10 feet, and in the whole length there are &s;ix &s;luices. Common merchantmen of about 120 tuns burden will be here able to pa&s;s and &s;ave a long,
<PB N="47" REF="51">
circuitous voyage round the extremity of Jutland, as may be &s;een by the map, and in which ve&s;&s;els are liable to be detained by contrary winds. Indeed this round-about navigation is &s;o tedious, that goods &s;hipped at Copenhagen for Hamburgh, are not unu&s;ually &s;ent to Lubec by &s;ea, and from thence by land to Hamburgh; but by this canal, a ve&s;&s;el may pa&s;s immediately from the Baltic into the German ocean, and proceed, without un|loading, to Hamburgh or Holland.</P>
<P>All Denmark, as it is bounded, lies in length between 54 degrees 45 minutes, and 58 degrees 15 minutes north latitude; its breadth is no where proportionable, but, at a large computation, it may be reckoned two-thirds the &s;ize of Ireland.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Norway, which belongs to the Crown of Denmark, has been already treated of in the fir&s;t vo|lume of this work.</P>
<P>Hol&s;tein, which includes Ditmar&s;h and Stormar, is bounded by the duchy of Sle&s;wick on the north, the duchy of Saxe Lawenburg on the &s;outh-ea&s;t, the river Elbe on the &s;outh-we&s;t, and the re&s;t of it is wa&s;hed by the German ocean and Baltic &s;ea. It is between latitudes and 55 54 north.</P>
<P>Oldenburgh and Delmenhur&s;t are two counties in Ger|many, that lie together, detached from all the territories
<PB N="48" REF="52">
of Denmark. The two rivers Elbe and We&s;er, and the duchy of Bremen interpo&s;ing between them and Hol&s;tein. They are bounded on the north-ea&s;t by the We&s;er, on the we&s;t by Ea&s;t Friezland and the County of Embden, and on the &s;outh, by part of the bi&s;hoprick of Mun&s;ter. They are a &s;mall territory of about 35 Engli&s;h miles in diameter, the middle of which is in the latitude of 53 degrees 30 minutes.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the King of Denmark's territories, not men|tioned in the enumeration of his titles, are the i&s;lands of Faro, Iceland, and Greenland, in the north &s;ea; the i&s;lands of St. Thomas, St. John, and St. Croix, with &s;ome of the C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">bb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e i&s;lands in the We&s;t Indies; the town of Tran|quebar with its territories, and the i&s;land of Nicobar on the coa&s;t of Coromandel in A&s;ia, and the citadel of Chri&s;|tianburg on the coa&s;t of Guinea in Africa. The north &s;ea i&s;lands have been de&s;cribed in Vol. I. the colonies detached will be &s;poken of hereafter; we &s;hall now only &s;peak of what is properly called Denmark, which con&s;i&s;ts of two large, and &s;everal &s;mall i&s;lands, with the penin|&s;ula of Jutland.</P>
<P>Jutland is the large&s;t and mo&s;t fertile country, but the i&s;lands are more con&s;iderable, on account of their &s;itua|tion, particularly Zealand, becau&s;e Copenhagen, the capi|tal of the empire is the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;eated, and the famous pa&s;&s;age of the Sound is bordered by its &s;hore. I will begin then with Zealand.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="53">Zealand is the large&s;t of all the Dani&s;h i&s;lands, it is nearly of a circular form, and is about 700 Engli&s;h miles round. The &s;oil is fertile, producing no bread-corn except rye, but yields plentiful crops of fine oats and barley. There are but few meadows in it, and yet there is no want of good hay, mo&s;t of their gra&s;s, which is &s;hort and &s;ure, growing by the &s;ides of their corn-fields, or in &s;cattered &s;pots of mar&s;hy grounds. It has no rivers, nor above half a &s;core brooks capable of turning a mill; but to &s;upply the deficiency of water there is a great number of fine lakes, &s;ufficiently &s;tored with fi&s;h. A gentleman remarkable for his wit, &s;peaking of this i&s;land, replied in French, to Mr. <HI>Wraxhall,</HI> who a&s;ked him if the country was plea&s;ant and agreeable; <HI>Mon&s;ieur il n'y a &s;ur cette i&s;le, ni montagne, ni riviere; mais pour des lacs; grace &agrave; Dieu, il y en a&s;&s;ez.</HI> It is very flat, but well &s;cattered with woods of oak and beech, and cultivated with great indu&s;try. By the great number of tumuli &s;cattered on all &s;ides, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Wraxhall,</HI> I thought my&s;elf &s;ometimes on &s;ome of the Wilt&s;hire or Hamp&s;hire downs. The&s;e tumuli re&s;emble, in &s;ize and appearance, tho&s;e in England, and are probably ancient Saxon &s;epulchres, but this is only conjecture, as none of them have been opened. There are al&s;o, and likewi&s;e in Sle&s;wick and Hol&s;tein, &s;everal collections of &s;tones &s;et up in a circular form, &s;ome of which are very large, and re&s;emble tho&s;e at Stonehenge in Wilts, though on a &s;maller &s;cale, of the origin of which the Danes are totally ignorant.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="54">Mr. <HI>Coxe</HI> ob&s;erved many &s;uch in the We&s;t Gothland in Sweden, between Lalange and Lidkioping, &s;ome in a rough &s;tate, a few hewn flat and broad, and others re|&s;embling pillars, pointed at top in the rude&s;t manner. The pea&s;ants in Sweden call them Gothic &s;tones, and &s;ay they were erected by the Goths, whom they repre&s;ent as a race of giants formerly inhabiting the&s;e countries.</P>
<P>The whole i&s;land is divided into 16 di&s;tinct counties, called ampts, or prefectures, and contains two cities, Copenhagen and Ro&s;kild.</P>
<P>The air in and about Copenhagen is but indifferent, owing to its low &s;ituation and the frequent fogs; yet owing to the purene&s;s of their firing, which is beech-wood, colds of the lungs are very rare. Near a fourth part of Zea|land is fore&s;t, lying open for the King's hunting and his game, flags, wild-boars, roe-bucks, &amp;c. The face of the land is plea&s;ant in many places, abounding with little hills, fine verdure, woods and lakes, with a very agreeable diver&s;ity. For &s;ea-ports, that mo&s;t excellent one of Copenhagen mu&s;t make amends for want of them, not only in this, but among other of the i&s;lands; there being few others capable of harbouring a ve&s;&s;el of 200 tons burden. But this is not a &s;en&s;ible want, as there are no commodities in this i&s;land to export.</P>
<P>Here, and in all Denmark are but two &s;ea&s;ons of the year, winter and &s;ummer. Spring and autumn are &s;el|dom

known, the &s;pring never. There is an imme|diate tran&s;ition from heat to cold, and from cold to heat. During the three months of June, July, and Augu&s;t, the heat is much more inten&s;e than in England, and very &s;ultry in the night, but 'tis a gloomy heat, an interpo&s;i|tion of thick vapours being perceived before the &s;un. In Copenhagen for the&s;e three months they are plagued with flies, which they endeavour to de&s;troy by a poi&s;oned water; in the laying of which in their kitchens and chambers, whole bu&s;hels of red flies may be &s;wept toge|ther in one room.</P>
<P>The next i&s;land to Zealand in &s;ize is Funen. The dio|ce&s;e of Funen includes the i&s;lands of Langeland, Laaland, Fal&s;ter, and &s;ome others. It has two governors; Funen and Langeland are under the one, Laaland and Fal&s;ter under the other.</P>
<P>The i&s;land of Funen lies between the great and little belt, is, according to <HI>Bu&s;ching</HI> 10 geographical miles long and nine broad. His geographical mile is about &s;ix miles Engli&s;h. It is &s;o fertile and plea&s;ant, that mo&s;t of the noble families in the kingdom have re&s;ided here for many years. The lands are as well cultivated as in mo&s;t of the counties in England, &s;ome inclo&s;ed with low, neatly kept hedges, and the open parts all under tillage.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="56">Funen has no mountains or rocks, but con&s;i&s;ts of gentle hills and declivities, with fine &s;preading vales; &s;ome of the higher grounds prettily topped with woods, and there being many rivulets, the whole country is beautiful, and re&s;embles many agreeable tracts in England. There is plenty of good pa&s;tures and meadows, and numerous herds of black cattle and hogs. The capital city of this dioce&s;e is Oden&s;e in Funen.</P>
<P>Langeland is &s;even geographical miles long from north to &s;outh, and one broad; very fertile, and is a county of it&s;elf, containing &s;even pari&s;hes.</P>
<P>Laaland is &s;even and a half geographical miles long, and three broad, and is the mo&s;t fertile &s;pot in all Denmark; but as the country lies low, the &s;oil is damp, and the air unwhole&s;ome. The nobility here are numerous, and have very fine &s;eats and large e&s;tates.</P>
<P>The i&s;land of Fal&s;ter, in &s;oil, &amp;c. re&s;embles the two de&s;cribed above; it is &s;ix geographical miles long, three wide in the north, and only one towards the &s;outh, and is two leagues di&s;tant from Zealand. It may be called the orchard of Denmark, for it yields abundance of fruit and all &s;orts of game. This i&s;land is commonly the dowry of the Queens of Denmark. It has a medicinal &s;pring.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="57">Amack is a &s;mall i&s;land joined to the city of Copenhagen by two bridges, one of the&s;e a drawbridge; it is a geogra|phical mile and a half in length, or, according to <HI>Coxe,</HI> four Engli&s;h miles long and two broad, quite level, with|out woods, except a few thickets. As the &s;oil is &s;o un|commonly rich and fertile, it is con&s;idered as the kitchen-garden and &s;torehou&s;e of the city; it is laid out in gar|dens and pa&s;tures, the inhabitants &s;upplying Copenhagen market twice a week with vegetables, milk, butter, and chee&s;e. It is divided into two pari&s;hes, and peopled with about 800 families; the de&s;cendants of &s;ome north Hollanders, invited to &s;ettle here by <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> II. in 1516, at the reque&s;t of his queen, who was a native of the Netherlands, and who were brought here to make butter and chee&s;e for the court. The i&s;land contains nine villages.</P>
<P>The Amackers &s;till retain the habit, language, and cu&s;tom of their predece&s;&s;ors, with all their cleanline&s;s and indu&s;try, nor will they intermarry with the Danes. Their di&s;trict is a medley of Low Dutch, German, and Dani&s;h, and the mini&s;ters &s;peak in Low Dutch as well as Dani&s;h. Part of the city of Copenhagen, called Chri&s;tian Shafen &s;tands on the i&s;le of Amack. The inhabitants have their own inferior tribunal, but, in capital offences, are amenable to the King's Court of Ju&s;tice at Copenhagen. The old national Friezland habit is &s;till in u&s;e among&s;t them. It re&s;embles the habit of the ancient quakers, as repre&s;ented in the pictures of the Dutch and Flemi&s;h
<PB N="54" REF="58">
painters. The men wear broad, trimmed hats, black jackets, fall glazed breeches of the &s;ame colour, loo&s;e at the knee and tied round about the wai&s;t. The women are in black jacket, and petticoats, with a piece of blue glazed cloth bound on their heads.</P>
<P>Jutland, part of the ancient Cimbrica Cher&s;one&s;us, is the large&s;t part of the kingdom, and may be computed at two thirds of the whole. It is divided into two Stifts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, or principal governments. This and the duchy of Sle&s;wick, form a penin&s;ula, the north part of which is Jutland. It is 38 geographical miles long, and from between 15 to 20 broad, and of all the territories be|longing to Denmark yields the greate&s;t revenue; the middle part of it, excepting a few &s;pots of arable land, is nothing but heath and moor, which, however, afford good pa&s;ture for oxen, &s;heep, and goats; but the other parts, which are of greater extent, are exceedingly fertile, the inhabitants annually exporting large quantities of grain to Sweden, Norway, and Holland, and al&s;o lean oxen, bacon, and hogs; &s;o that Jutland is called the land of bacon and rye-bread. It yields al&s;o great plenty of &s;ea-fi&s;h and river-fi&s;h, having many fre&s;h-water lakes. The chief b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gs and gulf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> are on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the penin&s;ula, and of the&s;e the principal is the gulf of Lym, called Lym&s;urt, which runs from the Categate, 20 geo|graphical miles into land, widening as it goes, and form|ing many &s;mall i&s;lands. It is navigable, and abounds with fi&s;h, and, as the we&s;t &s;ide of Jutland, is &s;eparated
<PB N="55" REF="59">
from the north &s;ea only by a narrow tract of land. There are other gulphs that form good harbours.</P>
<P>Jutland is every where inter&s;per&s;ed with hills and emi|nencies, and on the ea&s;t with fine woods of oak, beech, fir, birch, &amp;c. but the we&s;t &s;ide not being &s;o woody, the inhabitants burn turf and heath for fuel. Here is al&s;o great plenty of game. The air is rather keen and cold. The Jutlanders are of a robu&s;t, vigorous con&s;titution, and re&s;olute temper, and &s;eem to have rai&s;ed them&s;elves to a &s;tate of freedom &s;uperior to that of the other inhabi|tants of Denmark. Many of the Jutland pea&s;ants have freeholds, for which they pay only a &s;mall acknowledg|ment to the lord of the manor, and the public taxes. But the Dani&s;h language is &s;poken here with le&s;s purity and elegance than in the other provinces, and the Jutlanders have al&s;o a particular accent. It has four chief cities, Aalborg, Wiborg, Aarhuus, and Ripen, which are all bi&s;hops &s;ees.</P>
<P>The duchy of Sle&s;wick is called South Jutland. It is divided from the duchy of Hol&s;tein, and con&s;equently from the German empire, by the rivers Eyder and Lewens, which are its &s;outh boundaries; has the Baltic on the ea&s;t, the north &s;ea on the we&s;t; extends from Ren&s;burgh to Koldingen, about 18 geographical miles in length, and in breadth from eight to 14. It is a fiat country, and plentifully &s;upplied with corn, cattle, and fi&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="60">The inhabitants are a mixture of Danes, Juts, Lower Saxons, and Frie&s;ians; be&s;ides the&s;e there are Hollanders &s;ettled in Frederick&s;tadt, and Flemings in North&s;trand, which occa&s;ions a variety of dialects in this country. The German language is &s;poken in many places, and divine &s;ervice is performed in High Dutch.</P>
<P>Lutherani&s;m is the prevailing religion in this duchy, except at Frederick&s;tadt where all &s;ects are tolerated. On the i&s;land of Nord&s;trand, the Roman-catholicks have a pari&s;h-church and a chapel.</P>
<P>The i&s;land of Nord&s;trand lies on the north &s;ea, and was formerly three Dani&s;h miles long and a mile broad. It was inhabited by &s;avage Frie&s;ians, contained 22 pari&s;hes, and abounded in cattle and corn. It has been ever &s;ubject to inundations, but on the 11th of October, 1634, about 10 at night, the whole i&s;land was over|flowed, and the impetuo&s;ity of the waves was &s;o great, that 6,408 per&s;ons, 1,332 hou&s;es, 30 windmills, &s;ix &s;teeples, and 50,000 head of cattle were wa&s;hed away by the &s;ea. In Eider&s;tedt, be&s;ides 664 hou&s;es, in|volved in the &s;ame ruin, 2,107 per&s;ons, 6,100 head of cattle, and 6,738 &s;heep and hogs peri&s;hed at the &s;ame time. Of all Nord&s;trand nothing now remains but one &s;mall pari&s;h, which owed its &s;afety to the height of its &s;ituation.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="61">It mu&s;t be remarked as a great natural defect of the kingdom of Denmark, that throughout the whole there is not one river navigable for ve&s;&s;els of any con&s;iderable burden, unle&s;s we reckon the Elbe, which is rather the boundary of the kingdom than belonging to it.</P>
<P>That part of the duchy of Sle&s;wick which runs from Ren&s;burgh through Sle&s;wick to Hader&s;leve, from whence we cro&s;s the little belt, which is nine Engli&s;h miles over; this part of the duchy is well cultivated, is, in general, flat and open, but occa&s;ion|ally exhibits variegated land&s;capes, of heath, arable land, and pa&s;ture, enclo&s;ed with quick&s;et hedges, and &s;tudded with beech and oak. The farms have an ap|pearance of great neatne&s;s, and there are many ranges of new cottages lately erected at the expence of the Crown for coloni&s;ts. The&s;e cottages are &s;pacious, and re&s;emble tho&s;e of We&s;tphalia, containing, under the &s;ame roof, a large barn with divi&s;ions for cattle, and two rooms at the fur|ther end for the family. Each family is &s;upplied with ploughs, carts, and other nece&s;&s;ary implements of hu&s;|bandry, two hor&s;es, and a pen&s;ion for three years.</P>
<P><HI>Mar&s;hall</HI> travelled through the whole penin&s;ula of Jutland, and found very little wa&s;te land, the whole under cultivation, and, on enquiry, was informed that the nobi|lity re&s;ide in ca&s;tles of their own, and are all cultivators of their own land, by means of pea&s;ants, who are generally in a &s;tate of villainage. At Hod&s;edburgh, he &s;ays, he had
<PB N="58" REF="62">
the accident to break his chai&s;e, but Count <HI>Roncellen,</HI> the owner of a neighbouring ca&s;tle, being in &s;ight, and on hor&s;eback, rode up to him, and invited him, after &s;ome enquiries, to his chateau, &s;aying he would &s;end his &s;mith to repair it; for &s;miths and wheelers in this country are &s;carce, except in the larger villages.</P>
<P>At this nobleman's hou&s;e he was very ho&s;pitably en|tertained, and as it will give my readers &s;ome in&s;ight into the di&s;po&s;ition of the people, and, though a digre&s;&s;ion, relieve him from dry de&s;cription, I will relate what Mr. <HI>Mar&s;hall</HI> &s;aw and learned, in his own words:</P>
<P>"When we arrived," &s;ays he, "at the ca&s;tle, the Count carried me through, &s;everal large rooms, to one where his breakfa&s;t equipage was &s;pread, and introduced me to his friends. All the company &s;poke French. Breakfa&s;t was pre&s;ently &s;erved, and con&s;i&s;ted only of coffee and milk, and water-gruel for the Count, which &s;eemed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 words"> regular diet. In conver&s;ation, he told me, that the nobility and gentry of large fortunes cultivated their own e&s;tates, though of great extent; that he had let &s;ome farms in the Engli&s;h way, but the chief of his e&s;tate was in his own hands. I was with him &s;ome days, and he took me round his domain. In the cour&s;e of our ramble, we reached the confines of a little town on the &s;ide of a hill in a &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ul &s;pot, with a river at the bottom of the declivity. Of this town, &s;aid the count, I have built every hou&s;e at my own expence, and filled them with
<PB N="59" REF="63">
manufacturers. We entered it. He &s;hewed me the fabrics which he had e&s;tabli&s;hed. They were chiefly of wool. A great number of &s;pinners, combers, and weavers, who made a coar&s;e cloth, worn by the poor of this country. The manager of the works was an Engli&s;h|man, whom the Count had brought with him from England. He informed me, he had 400 hands employed in woollen goods alone; that he wrought up all the &s;orts of cloathing which found a ready market there. He &s;aid the profits ari&s;ing from this manufactory were &s;mall as to him, but they were no object, they paid all the expences of the buildings he had erected, and he was a clear gainer of the number of people, whom he had thus &s;ettled on his e&s;tate, and who con&s;umed the produce of his land.</P>
<P>"He had al&s;o another manufactory of leather, having erected &s;everal tanneries, which prepared the hides for manufacturing into doublets, breeches, boots, &s;tockings, and &s;hoes. Of the&s;e arti&s;ts he employed hear 300, and &s;ound a quick &s;ale for their manufacture and more profi|table than his woollen manufacture. He next &s;hewed me his fabric of turnery ware. He had laid in large &s;tocks of beech-wood, elm, horn-beam, holly, &amp;c. and had e&s;ta|bli&s;hed many arti&s;ts in this way; wooden di&s;hes, platters, cups, &s;aucers, bowls, &s;coops, &amp;c. things in common u&s;e among&s;t the villagers; of the&s;e he had 120 em|ployed. He had al&s;o a &s;mall linen-manufactory, which employs about 40 hands, working up coar&s;e linen for
<PB N="60" REF="64">
&s;heets, &s;hirts, &amp;c. and which was, when he was there in 1769, and 1770, very much on the increa&s;e.</P>
<P>"Not one of this patriotic nobleman's works &s;o much plea&s;ed him as his manufactories of iron. Of the&s;e he worked all &s;orts of implements in common u&s;e, whether for the furniture of hou&s;es, or dome&s;tic uten&s;ils; machines for arti&s;ts, &s;uch as wheelwrights, carpenters, black&s;miths, as al&s;o all implements for hu&s;bandry, and all the&s;e in great numbers, for which he found a ready vent. In this iron fabrick he employed more than 200 men.</P>
<P>"In all the&s;e manufactories he employed more than 1000 per&s;ons, and the &s;ucce&s;s of them has proved &s;o great, as to fix above 2000 inhabitants in the town he built for them, which con&s;i&s;ts of 300 hou&s;es. The &s;treets are laid out very regularly, inter&s;ecting each other at right angles. In the centre is a large market-place, and in the mid&s;t of it, a &s;mall, but neat, church. The whole town is well paved; the hou&s;es are but &s;mall, but all built with brick and tiled, which make a regular and, good appearance.</P>
<P>"The bricks and tiles are burnt in adjoining kilns be|longing to the Count, and the timber is cut in his own fore&s;ts; &s;o that his expences were very &s;mall, to what they would have been in other circum&s;tances; but notwith|&s;tanding this in the cour&s;e of 23 years &s;ince he began the&s;e works, he had expended 33,000 ducats, or near 16,000<HI>l.</HI>

&s;terling. This account includes the church, the paving of the town, and the erection of the works and build|ings for the &s;everal manufactories above-mentioned; be|&s;ides the hou&s;es and &s;hares of hou&s;es, for &s;ome per&s;ons advanced part of the money towards building their own. Exclu&s;ive of this expence he had been employed three years in erecting a hand&s;ome bridge over the river, a wharf on the banks of it, with warehou&s;es for merchan|dize, and dry and wet docks for buildings barges, and decked &s;loops on the river. The tide flows up to the town, though at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the &s;ea; and the Count, among his noble plans, has &s;chemed the fixing a trade at it. This town is &s;ituated between Pal|li&s;berg and Winguard; the river falls into the gulph that Ring&s;hopping &s;tands on; but he has been employed in cutting a canal about two miles long, to gain a better navigation into a bay to the northward, near Wo&s;berg. By this means he hopes to navigate brigs of 100 tons; whereas, at pre&s;ent (1770), he had only five &s;loops, each of 50 tons. The&s;e he wholly employs him&s;elf, in bringing materials for his manufactures from the Baltick, England, and Holland. His bridge, wharfs, docks, and warehou&s;es, he calculates will co&s;t him 16,000 ducats, and his navigation above 3000.</P>
<P>"I do not remember," continues our author, "ever receiving &s;o much plea&s;ure, from viewing the&s;e great and noble exertions of princely magnificence, infinitely ex|ceeding all the co&s;tly ornaments which in &s;ome countries
<PB N="62" REF="66">
are given to the &s;eats of the great. They reflect im|mortal honour on the worthy Count, who has the &s;pirit thus to pro&s;ecute the noble&s;t works which Europe can exhibit. Other noblemen in Denmark have fortunes equal to this illu&s;trious Count: in England we have for|tunes double and treble to his; but where are we to find an expenditure of a great e&s;tate, that reflects equal lu&s;tre on the owner?" Mr. <HI>Mar&s;hall</HI> may well &s;ay this.&mdash;"In England a great fortune is di&s;&s;ipated, in hor&s;e-racing, women, and gaming, without either benefit to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, or the country belonging to him.</P>
<P>"The beginning of all my undertakings," &s;aid that illu&s;trious nobleman, "I ever find the mo&s;t difficult. In e&s;tabli&s;hing the woollen manufactury, I had infinite trou|ble at fir&s;t, in opening a regular channel, through which I could receive the wool; for our own was &s;o bad, that I could &s;carce u&s;e any of it; and next, to get people u&s;ed to the different branches, from picking and &s;orting for the &s;pinners, quite to the weavers. Mo&s;t of the people I procured from Germany and Flanders; but a few who proved more u&s;eful to me, than all the re&s;t, from Scotland, and two or three from England. To all the&s;e people I have been obliged to give large &s;alaries, to build them good hou&s;es, and put up with many irre|gularities; but I was indefatigable in making my own people learn of them, what they could perform; and the be&s;t way of doing this, I found, was to give premiums to foreigners for every hand they made perfect in each
<PB N="63" REF="67">
branch of work. Several of the&s;e per&s;ons are dead, and I have not taken any pains to recruit their number; for my Danes are now, many of them, as expert as their ma&s;ters. I have, however, very often, &s;traggling par|ties of Germans, who come to a&s;k work, which I never fail giving them, and building hou&s;es for them, if they continue in the mind of &s;ettling: but as I &s;till mean to at|tempt new manufactures, I mu&s;t have recour&s;e to other countries for a few hands to in&s;truct us.</P>
<P>"From the fir&s;t out&s;et of my undertaking, I found it nece&s;&s;ary to unite the character of merchant and manu|facturer; for had it not been for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a little &s;hipping, which &s;upplied me with the materials I wanted, I &s;hould never have been able to have brought my works to the height at which they have now arrived. My &s;loops are &s;trong and well built, and would run without danger or difficulty, even to the Mediterranean, if I had occa&s;ion to &s;end them; with the advantage of coming up into the very heart of my town. I once had a brig of 200 tons, but finding this ve&s;&s;el inconvenient, I parted with her, and now confine my&s;elf to &s;loops. I have a Dutch &s;hip-carpenter, who builds them for me; and he has &s;ix Danes who work under him. I have al&s;o two herring bu&s;&s;es on the &s;tocks, with which I purpo&s;e attempting the herring-fi&s;hery; having engaged three Dutch fi&s;her|men, u&s;ed to barrelling. If I meet with &s;ucce&s;s, I &s;hall encrea&s;e my number of bu&s;&s;es; and when my canal is completed, I will build &s;ome larger &s;loops, and a brig
<PB N="64" REF="68">
or two of 100 tons, to carry the product of my fi&s;hery up the Streights, and bring back &s;alt in return.</P>
<P>"My great object is to make every part of my general plan unite, to form one whole, by rendering each divi&s;ion of it the &s;upport of another. All the&s;e works have a wonderful efficacy in increa&s;ing the people on my e&s;tate. Though not a hut was &s;tanding in this place 23 years ago, there are now above 2000 inhabi|tants. My buildings increa&s;e con&s;iderably every year. I have a great number of brick and lime-burners, ma&s;ons, &s;miths, and carpenters, that do nothing el&s;e but build hou&s;es for new-comers. This work regulates all the re&s;t; it is the fir&s;t I provide ca&s;h for, and what I can &s;pare from this, I expend on the other works. I built 35 hou&s;es la&s;t year, and the number this year will be near 40, and from the applications I have re|ceived, I apprehend, I &s;hall next year build more than 60. I will next &s;hew the effect this population has had upon my hu&s;bandry.</P>
<P>"The extent of this nobleman's e&s;tate is nine Engli&s;h miles one way, and more than four another, but &s;ome|what indented. It is a fine, variegated country of hill and dale, with &s;ome mountains well watered with rivers, &s;treams, and lakes; and part of it nobly &s;pread with ex|ceeding fine timber.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="69">"On riding over the e&s;tate, I found not only the vallies under high cultivation, but the &s;ides of the hills, with great numbers of farm-hou&s;es and cottages, the inhabitants of which &s;eemed as ea&s;y, chearful, and happy, as if they had been re&s;ident in England; they all appeared plea&s;ed with the pre&s;ence of their lord, and e&s;teem him as their ma&s;ter and father. When I came to this e&s;tate, &s;aid the Count, I found it farmed by my fathers bailiffs and va&s;&s;als; but &s;oon di&s;covering the&s;e bailiffs to be ra&s;cals, I turned them all out; di&s;po&s;ed of the land to &s;uch indu&s;trious and &s;aving people as were then on the e&s;tate, and to whom I let farms according to their ability of living and &s;tocking. I did not leave them totally to the cu&s;toms of their own country, but procured hu&s;bandmen and implements from Flanders; gave pre|miums to the be&s;t ploughmen, and to tho&s;e who produced the greate&s;t crops, and be&s;t adapted to wintering of cattle; &s;o that I have improved my lands, and made the&s;e bring in a rent of 18 <HI>s.</HI> Engli&s;h per acre, that, when I fir&s;t became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, were wa&s;te tracks. This is wholly owing to the market occa&s;ioned by my new colony, which has not only enriched me, but every tenant on my e&s;tate.</P>
<P>"The wa&s;te tracks I manage thus: I allow the farmers the expence of inclo&s;ing whatever they like to take, con|tiguous to their farms, provided they take no more land than they keep well cultivated, and I take no rent for &s;uch fields for five years. After this, they pay me for them about half the value, which continues as long as the
<PB N="66" REF="70">
improver lives; but on his death, I rai&s;e it to the full value. The&s;e terms they think &s;o rea&s;onable, that there is not a pea&s;ant among them, but what makes a &s;mall addition every year, and others who get or &s;ave money, have new farms on the &s;ame terms; paying me, in addi|tion, intere&s;t for the money I expend in buildings for them. I am very attentive to the&s;e new tracts of culti|vated land, to &s;ee that they do not neglect them; for I never &s;uffer a piece of land, once inclo&s;ed, to remain untilled; and as I &s;ee my town and people increa&s;e an|nually, a ready market is found for the produce of the&s;e new inclo&s;ures.</P>
<P>"Where I found land very &s;tony or boggy, le&s;t the apparent &s;terility of &s;uch lands &s;hould di&s;courage my tenants from taking them, I was at half the expence of removing the &s;tones or draining the bogs, or advanced money for their doing it. This has induced them to &s;ur|mount all difficulties, and I have the plea&s;ure to con|template that &s;everal tracts of rich meadow, worth 18 <HI>s.</HI> per acre, were reclaimed from a bog worth nothing."</P>
<P>My readers will naturally with me look upon this very patriotic nobleman rather as a being of romance, a vi&s;ion of perfection, than a real in&s;tance of &s;o many public and private virtues. Mr. <HI>Mar&s;hall</HI> is very minute and particular in his account of the manner in which this gentleman proceeded, and if any man of large fortune and domain &s;hould catch fire from this abridged &s;tate of it, and wi&s;h
<PB N="67" REF="71">
to imitate it, I will refer him to the author from whom I took it: <HI>Mar&s;hall's Travels through Denmark.</HI></P>
<P>The land which the Count kept in his own hands was originally the wor&s;t part of his whole e&s;tate; finding no per&s;on inclined to farm it, he undertook it him&s;elf. It &s;preads every way for three or four miles round his town, and is now the riche&s;t land of the whole.</P>
<P>"In all the improvements," &s;aid the Count to Mr. <HI>Mar&s;hall,</HI> "which I have made on my e&s;tate, by letting my lands to the pea&s;ants, I have adhered &s;trictly to the rule of proceeding on the very contrary conduct which is common among nine-tenths of the nobility of the king|dom. They keep their tenants as poor and humble as po&s;&s;ible; I, on the contrary, do every thing to enable them to enrich them&s;elves, and would rather in&s;pire them with the manly boldne&s;s of the poor in your country, than keep them in the &s;lavery of ours. My pea&s;ants grow daily into wealthy farmers, and are all in ea&s;y and happy circum&s;tances. They marry and beget numerous po&s;terities. The population of my e&s;tate increa&s;es, and with the people, the general markets for products, which I have all along aimed at, and which is ju&s;t &s;o much clear gain in my pocket. I have not a man on my e&s;tate that is not profitable to me in &s;ome way or other, and it is incredible how quick they increa&s;e. There is not &s;uch a thing as a marriageable man or woman on it, that is unmarried. Every man and woman that applys to
<PB N="68" REF="72">
me for a hou&s;e, are &s;ure of having one built for them, if I know them to be of good character and indu&s;trious; and they have all a &s;mall piece of land, and are chearful and contented. In &s;uch a &s;ituation, marriages mu&s;t abound, and the people increa&s;e in a manner which no part of Europe has any idea of. Among all my people there is not one that is burden&s;ome to the re&s;t; no old pea&s;ant, or labourer, but what has &s;aved enough, before he grew old, to live happily in his latter days; very few but what become little farmers before they are too ad|vanced in life, and in a &s;tate which their relations would think it &s;hameful to let them want their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>"The example of my own e&s;tate," continued the Count, "proves to me, that nothing is wanting to make a country populous, and con&s;equently rich, but giving the people an object for their indu&s;try to work upon; the mo&s;t idle will of them&s;elves be converted to indu&s;try; if their indu&s;try is beneficial to them, and they have no dependance on any thing el&s;e. No people are naturally more indolent then the common people of Denmark; but in the mo&s;t populous part of Holland, they are not more active and indu&s;trious than all the people on my e&s;tate; which change has been effected merely by throw|ing them into the pur&s;uit of gain, and leaving them quietly to enjoy it. The natural increa&s;e of mankind is prodigious, when marriages are no burden, but chil|dren riches.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="73">"But I mean to bound my progre&s;s; convinced that where land is cultivated to the utmo&s;t, the cultivators them&s;elves could not con&s;ume the produce. It is nece&s;|&s;ary for the welfare of &s;tates, that there &s;hould be a bal|lance kept up between commerce and agriculture, and that manufactures &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed, to produce a mar|ket, to carry off the &s;urplus, which the cultivators cannot con&s;ume them&s;elves. Under this con&s;ideration, when every part of my e&s;tate is fully improved, and a market provided for all its products, at a good price, not a high one, (for extremes are not permanent) I will neither build another hou&s;e or another &s;hip. I will &s;it down content with that degree of &s;ucce&s;s, not having a doubt but it will be la&s;ting; becau&s;e the agriculture, manu|factures and commerce will be balanced and dependant on each other, exactly to the re&s;pective amount of each; and as there will be no fabricks wrought, but what are of univer&s;al demand, and no commerce pu&s;hed on, but what the fabrics employ; and as all the people in each of the&s;e branches will be dependant for their provi&s;ions and nece&s;&s;aries on the track of culture around them, and on no other, all dangerous exce&s;s will be guarded again&s;t, and a regular indu&s;try will maintain it&s;elf, without being hurt by the acqui&s;ition of great riches.</P>
<P>It is to be here remarked, that in Denmark the King, as the clergy have here, has the tenth of all land-pro|ducts, and this in many parts of the kingdom is ga|thered in kind, and &s;old by his &s;uperintendants; but
<PB N="70" REF="74">
landlords may compound, though the compo&s;ition is generally high. Count <HI>Roncellen</HI> always paid the com|po&s;ition rather than his tenants &s;hould be di&s;couraged by this tax; nor would he &s;uffer his e&s;tate to be overrun by hunters, &s;o common in Denmark.</P>
<P>Were our young nobility and gentry in England to ap|ply them&s;elves to agriculture, they would render better &s;ervice to their country, and find their life more agreea|ble than that of arms, the pay of which is utterly incom|petent to the expen&s;ive life they are thus thrown into. Unlooked-for promotions make, on the whole, very poor amends for &s;uch a regular life of poverty; but in hu&s;bandry, if they gave an active attention to it, they would find far better revenues, with much le&s;s expen|&s;ive life, than any &s;ervice can confer; and at the &s;ame time, the profe&s;&s;ion has nothing di&s;honourable in it, and every exertion made would tend to promote, in the highe&s;t degree, the intere&s;t of their country.</P>
<P>"I will clo&s;e this account," &s;ays Mr. <HI>Mar&s;hall,</HI> "with ob&s;erving, that Count <HI>Roncellen's</HI> fortune is as con&s;idera|ble as the greate&s;t e&s;tates in England, and yet his way of living in the ca&s;tle is not &s;uperior to that of an Engli&s;h gentleman of two or three thou&s;and pounds a year. His table was always well &s;pread with plenty of every thing that was in &s;ea&s;on; but then his own e&s;tate produces every thing but &s;ugar, &s;pices, and wine. He has river and &s;ea-fi&s;h in great perfection. His fore&s;t yields him veni&s;on
<PB N="71" REF="75">
and game, and other parts of his land plenty of wild fowl; all which, with the cultivated products, afford ample materials for a regular table. In his wines, he is by no means expen&s;ive; and his dre&s;s, comparatively &s;peaking, co&s;ts him nothing. All his revenue, therefore, which increa&s;es much every year, is expended as fa&s;t as it comes in, in the noble undertakings of which I have given an account. Such an expenditure does as much benefit to the &s;tate, as honour to him&s;elf, and is a way of laying out a great income, that can never be &s;ufficiently prai&s;ed.</P>
<P>"Perhaps, al&s;o, it is as full of enjoyment as any other di&s;po&s;ition of it can be. Let us &s;uppo&s;e an Engli&s;h nobleman of thirty or forty thou&s;and pounds a year, living in the u&s;ual cour&s;e of di&s;&s;ipation, electioneering, and gam|ing, and you will ever &s;ee in them a &s;pecies of remor&s;e and di&s;tru&s;t at the cramped &s;ituation which &s;ucce&s;&s;ive mortgages bring on; and if the income is exceeded, the expenditure of it gives but a momentary plea&s;ure, and never a la&s;ting &s;atisfaction; but, on the contrary, let us picture to our&s;elves, a nobleman &s;pending &s;uch an in|come, the year round, upon the &s;pot that yields it to him, in building, planting, improving wa&s;tes, making roads, cutting canals, e&s;tabli&s;hing manufactories, opening har|bours, attracting commerce; in a word, executing &s;uch noble works as Count <HI>Roncellen</HI> has been employed in, and I think, that &s;uch an employment of a great fortune mu&s;t be infinitely &s;uperior, in &s;elf-&s;atisfaction and enjoy|ment,
<PB N="72" REF="76">
to the other di&s;po&s;ition of it. This alone in&s;ures an increa&s;e, and adding every day to a man's wealth, at the &s;ame time that every &s;hiliing he makes is more beneficial to the community than to him&s;elf."</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of the Cities, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE chief cities of Denmark, are Copenhagen, El&s;inore, and Ro&s;kild in Zealand; Oden&s;ee in Funen; Wiborg in North Jutland, and Sle&s;wick in South Jutland: but I will &s;peak of each in their turn.</P>
<P>Copenhagen is the capital of the empire. It lies in the Baltick, or Ea&s;t Sea, in 55 degrees, 40 minutes, north latitude, about five geographical miles from the Sound. Its &s;ituation is mar&s;hy and low, but on the land-&s;ide there are &s;everal beautiful lakes, which furni&s;h the in|habitants with plenty of fre&s;h-water. The environs are very plea&s;ant, and directly oppo&s;ite to the city lies the fertile i&s;le of Amack, forming the harbour. At a di&s;|tance the city makes a magnificent appearance, accord|ing to Lord <HI>Mole&s;worth,</HI> who wrote in the beginning of this century, and is nearly equal in &s;ize to Bri&s;tol, as it

was then, but was increa&s;ing annually, as Bri&s;tol has done. "It is the be&s;t built city," &s;ays Mr. <HI>Coxe,</HI> "in the north; for although Peter&s;burgh excells it in &s;uperb edifices, yet, as it contains no wooden hou&s;es, it does not di&s;play that &s;triking contra&s;t of meanne&s;s and magni|ficence. It is &s;urrounded, on the land, with regular ram|parts and ba&s;tions, a broad ditch full of water, and a few out-works. Its circumference mea&s;ures between four and five Engli&s;h miles. The &s;treets are well paved, with a footway on each &s;ide, but too narrow and incon|venient for general u&s;e. The greate&s;t part of the build|ings are of brick, and a few are of free-&s;tone, brought from Germany. The hou&s;es of the nobility are, in general, &s;plendid, and con&s;tructed in the Italian &s;tyle of architecture. The Gother &s;treet, which runs in a &s;traight line acro&s;s the whole city, and divides the old from the new town, is above 4,200 feet long, the breadth of the King's market, and the area about the new harbour in|cluded. The city contains four royal ca&s;tles, ten pari&s;hes, and nine other churches, a con&s;iderable num|ber of public and private palaces; above 4,000 burghers hou&s;es, &s;everal of which are inhabited by ten or more families, eleven market and public places, areas or &s;quares, 186 &s;treets, and 100,000 inhabitants. The metropolis is divided into three principal parts, <HI>viz.</HI> Old Copenhagen, New Copenhagen, and Chri&s;tian|hafen. The la&s;t two are more modern then the fir&s;t, and are laid out in broad &s;treets, running in a &s;traight
<PB N="74" REF="79">
line. In the night, the city is illuminated with lanthorns, and the &s;treets are kept clean, at the yearly expence of 10 or 12,000 rix dollars.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t &s;triking object is the harbour and naval ar&s;e|nal; it is capacious enough to hold 500 men of war, and yet only one &s;hip can enter at a time, which entrance is defended by &s;everal batteries of great guns; and there are &s;everal platforms near it, with three forts. There are no tides in the Baltick, but the depth of water, in the harbour, renders it perfectly &s;ecure, for the greate&s;t &s;hips; &s;o that it is ju&s;t|y reckoned one of the be&s;t harbours in the world. The King's fleet, (for this is the princi|pal &s;ea-port in the kingdom,) lies regularly arranged be|tween booms, and over again&s;t them magazines, with the name of each &s;hip on the door of the &s;tore-room belong|ing to it; and every thing is kept in the complete&s;t order. The admiralty is on the bank of the haven, and the ar&s;enal is well furni&s;hed with cannon and &s;tores. Adjoining to the&s;e buildings is a citadel, which com|mands the harbour.</P>
<P>Commerce, according to <HI>Coxe,</HI> is here very bu&s;y: the haven is always crouded with merchant-&s;hips, and the &s;treets are inter&s;ected by broad canals, which bring &s;hips clo&s;e up to the walls of the quays. But Mr. <HI>Wraxhall</HI> &s;ays, though Copenhagen is one of the fine&s;t ports in the world, it can boa&s;t of little commerce; and yet <HI>Coxe</HI> and <HI>Wraxhall</HI> are cotemporary writers. <HI>Wraxhall</HI> fur|ther

&s;ays, the public places are filled with officers, either in the land or &s;ea-&s;ervice, and they appear to con&s;titute three-fourths of the audience at the play and opera. They have a Dani&s;h comedy twice a week, and an Italian opera, in the palace, every Saturday.</P>
<P>The palace, which was erected by Chri&s;tian VI. and was fini&s;hed in 1740, is a large pile of building, the front of &s;tone, and the wings of bricks &s;tuccoed. The &s;uite of apartments is princely, but the external appear|ance more grand than elegant.</P>
<P>The round tower of Trinity church, &s;ays Dr. <HI>Oliver,</HI> who was there in the beginning of this century, is a ma&s;ter-piece of its kind, and very &s;ingular. It is round, 150 feet high, and 60 feet diameter, being flat on the top, and &s;urrounded with an iron balu&s;trade. The a&s;cent is &s;piral, and without &s;teps, from the bot|tom to the top, wide enough for two carriages, and &s;o ea&s;y, that a coach and hor&s;es may go up and down again with ea&s;e. This tower was originally de&s;igned for an ob|&s;ervatory; but it then &s;erved as a parade; for the gentry, when they had a mind to take the air in their coaches, drove to the top, round the ring, and down again.</P>
<P>The police of this city is well regulated, and people may pa&s;s through any part of it, at midnight, with great &s;afety. The &s;treets are as quiet at eleven o'clock at night, as in a country village or town, and &s;carce a coach after this is heard to rattle through them.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="81">St. Saviour's church is the mo&s;t magnificent and ele|gant of all the churches in Copenhagen. It &s;tands in Chri&s;tianhafen in the I&s;le of Amack; and has a beautiful &s;teeple, with a &s;piral a&s;cent to the top on the out&s;ide.</P>
<P>Between Copenhagen and Chri&s;tianhafen, is a high pillar erected in the middle of the water, on which is a &s;tatue, repre&s;enting a naked female; on her left &s;ide &s;tands the figure of a &s;wan, which extends its long neck behind her back, and bringing its head over the right &s;houlder of the &s;tatue, &s;ticks its bill in the mouth of it. This pillar and &s;tatue are looked upon as a &s;ymbolical repre&s;entation of the city of Copenhagen.</P>
<P>There is a noble foundation for the poor in this city, called Wartow Ho&s;pital, containing 300 beds for the &s;ick and poor, and every one, be&s;ides his lodging, has a rix-dollar weekly. A &s;mall commodious church &s;tands clo&s;e to the ho&s;pital, and &s;o contrived, that the &s;ick and bed-ridden may hear divine &s;ervice and &s;ermons in their beds.</P>
<P>The royal palace, called Ro&s;enburg, in the we&s;t quarter of this city, is a grand &s;tructure, much too &s;plendid and magnificent for a King of Denmark, and has &s;ome very exten&s;ive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd ornamented gardens, which, in &s;ummer, &s;erve the inhabitants for a public walk. The grand apartment of this palace is hung with tape&s;try, re|pre&s;enting the various actions, by &s;ea and land, which
<PB N="77" REF="82">
diver&s;ified the ancient wars between the Swedes and Danes; who &s;eem always to have had the &s;ame national rival|&s;hip and animo&s;ity, as between the French and Engli&s;h. At one end of this apartment are three &s;ilver lions, as large as life, who, by their fiercene&s;s and rudene&s;s, &s;eem to characteri&s;e the age in which they were ca&s;t. It is a kind of &s;avage magnificence, &s;eldom &s;een in the ban|queting rooms of the pre&s;ent effeminate and luxurious times. In the mu&s;eum of the palace, which con&s;i&s;ts of eight rooms, is a &s;word of <HI>Charles</HI> XII. of Sweden, the hilt and guard of bra&s;s, and the blade four feet long; and the chair in which <HI>Tycho Brah&egrave;,</HI> the a&s;tronomer, u&s;ed to &s;it. The collection of paintings is very large, and con|tains &s;ome beautiful originals; among a great variety of natural and artificial curio&s;ities. Among the former are:</P>
<P N="1">1. A petrified child, which was cut out of its mother's belly at Sens, in Champagne, in the year 1582, where it was &s;uppo&s;ed to have lain 28 years. It is evidently a human foetus, &s;ays Dr. <HI>Oliver,</HI> who handled it; its upper part is of a gyp&s;eus nature, not &s;o hard as the lower, the thighs and buttocks being as hard and perfect &s;tone as can be, of a red colour, and of a grain and &s;uperficies ex|actly like tho&s;e taken out of a bladder: purcha&s;ed from Venice, by Frederick III.</P>
<P N="2">2. Two elephants teeth, that weigh 150lb. each.</P>
<P N="3">3. Several heads of hares, with divers &s;orts of horns, brought out of Saxony.</P>
<P N="4">4. An egg, &s;aid to be laid by a woman, of the &s;ize of a pullet's egg. This, <HI>Ol. Wormius</HI> &s;ays, was &s;ent

The fir&s;t they broke, and found a yolk and a white, as in that of a hen. The &s;econd was kept and &s;ent to him, and is here pre&s;erved.</P>
<P N="5">5. Several large pieces of &s;ilver ore, dug in Norway, one of which weighed 560lb. four feet &s;ix inches long, and four feet round, valued at 5,000 crowns. The whole ma&s;s has not above a fourth part of any ba&s;er metal or earth mixed with it.</P>
<P N="6">6. The thigh bone of a human body, three feet three inches long: the head of it, two feet 5 inches round, and the middle, 19 inches and a half about.</P>
<P N="7">7. Two &s;collop &s;hells, weighing 224lb. each.</P>
<P N="8">8. A cherry-&s;tone, on which &s;ome hundreds of heads are curiou&s;ly engraved.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the above, there is in the gardens of the palace a throne made of unicorns horns, on which all the Kings of Denmark are &s;eated at their coronation.</P>
<P>The royal library con&s;i&s;ts of a great variety of books in all languages, well conditioned, and well cho&s;en; the books of each country being placed by them&s;elves. The room is &s;pacious and well built, and has a large gallery, &s;upported by pillars, on each &s;ide. With the addition of <HI>Gudius</HI>'s library from Gluc&s;tadt, it might be reckoned one of the fir&s;t in Europe.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="84">The annual li&s;t of births in Copenhagen, being on an average 2,830, and that of the deaths 2,955, we may compute that it contains near 80,000 inhabitants.</P>
<P>El&s;inoor lies about 20 miles from Copenhagen, is a &s;ea|port town, directly oppo&s;ite to Hel&s;ingberg in Sweden, and &s;eparated from that by the Sound, or pa&s;&s;age into the Baltick, which, from town to town, according to Mr. <HI>Coxe,</HI> is but three miles over, and which he cro&s;&s;ed, though the wind was again&s;t him, in an hour and a half. From Copenhagen acro&s;s to Malmoe, in Sweden, is &s;ix or &s;even leagues.</P>
<P>This town is remarkable for two things, as being the &s;cene of <HI>Shake&s;pere</HI>'s <HI>Hamlet,</HI> and the place where Queen <HI>Matilda,</HI> the &s;i&s;ter of our King, George III. of England, was confined. It is well built; the hou&s;es are of brick, &s;imilar to tho&s;e in Holland. Next to Copen|hagen, it is the mo&s;t commercial place in Denmark. It contains two churches, and about 5,000 inhabitants, among&s;t whom are a con&s;iderable number of foreign merchants, and the con&s;uls of the principal nations, trading to the Baltic, to regulate the tolls paid by &s;hips, pa&s;&s;ing the Sound (of which I &s;hall &s;peak here-after), and to &s;ee that no inju&s;tice is done to their country|men. The pa&s;&s;age of the Sound is guarded by the for|tre&s;s of Cronberg, &s;ituated on the edge of a penin&s;ular promontory, the neare&s;t point of land from the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t of Sweden. It is &s;trongly fortified, and every

<P>Adjoining to a royal hunting palace, which &s;tands half a mile from Cronberg, is a garden, called <HI>Hamlet</HI>'s Garden, and &s;aid to be the very &s;pot where his father was murdered. As this is a hi&s;tory, that will, from <HI>Shake&s;pere</HI>'s play, intere&s;t an Engli&s;h reader; and as <HI>Saxo-Grammaticus,</HI> the Dani&s;h hi&s;torian, who relates it, is but in few hands, and has never been tran&s;lated, &s;ome little account of this famous prince may not be unaccept|able. <HI>Saxo-Grammaticus</HI> wrote in the 12th century.</P>
<P><HI>Hamlet</HI> was the &s;on of <HI>Gertrude,</HI> a daughter of a King of Denmark, by a King of Jutland, who reigned be|fore the introduction of chri&s;tianity into that part of the world: <HI>Fengo</HI> murders his brother, the King of Jutland, marries <HI>Gertrude,</HI> and a&s;cends his throne. <HI>Hamlet,</HI> his nephew, and &s;on-in-law, &s;truck with horror at this tran|&s;action, to avoid his uncle's jealou&s;y, feigns him&s;elf mad; but <HI>Fengo</HI> &s;u&s;pecting it, tries, by various means, to get at the real &s;tate of his mind, and among other attempts throws a young woman in his way, in a retired place, with directions, if po&s;&s;ible, to extort from <HI>Hamlet,</HI> a confe&s;&s;ion of his madne&s;s; but it did not &s;ucceed. On this woman is grounded <HI>Shake&s;pere's Ophelia.</HI> Another attempt of <HI>Fengo,</HI> was his quitting El&s;inoor, and concert|ing

a meeting between <HI>Hamlet</HI> and his mother, and or|dering a courtier to conceal him&s;elf, unknown to them, behind the hangings of the room where they were to meet. This man conceals him&s;elf in the Queen's apartment under a heap of &s;traw, which u&s;ed formerly to be &s;pread over floors as an article of luxury. <HI>Hamlet,</HI> on entering the room, &s;u&s;pecting the pre&s;ence of &s;ome &s;py, affects madne&s;s, imitates the crowing of a cock, beating his arms again&s;ts his &s;ides, as a cock doth his wings, jumps on the heap of &s;traw, and feeling the man within concealed, draws his &s;word and kills him, then cut the body to pieces, boiled it, and gave it to the hogs. After this he declared to his mother, that he only affected to be fooli&s;h, reproached her for her ince&s;tuous marriage, with her hu&s;band's brother and murderer, and thus re|calls the Queen to virtue. <HI>Fengo</HI> returns to El&s;inoor, &s;ends <HI>Hamlet</HI> to England, under the care of two cour|tiers, and privately, by a letter to the King of England, reque&s;ts him to put <HI>Hamlet</HI> to death. <HI>Hamlet</HI> di&s;covers this, alters the letter, by which means the two courtiers are put to death, and <HI>Hamlet</HI> is betrothed to the King of England's daughter. The next year he returns to Den|mark, where they under&s;tood he was dead, and &s;urprizes his enemies. He affects in&s;anity again, invites the prin|cipal nobles to an entertainment, makes them drunk, and in that &s;tate covers them with a large curtain, which he pegged to the ground, &s;et fire to the palace, and burnt them to a&s;hes. During this conflagration, he flew to <HI>Fengo's</HI> apartment, and put him to death. The next

morning, when the populace a&s;&s;embled to view the ruins of the palace, <HI>Hamlet</HI> called together the remaining nobles, harrangued them in a ma&s;terly &s;peech, proved his uncle to have been the murderer of his father, and ju&s;|tified his own conduct. His &s;peech had the de&s;ired effect, and he was proclaimed King with repeated acclama|tions.</P>
<P><HI>Hamlet,</HI> thus rai&s;ed to the throne, &s;ails to England, a&s;ks the King of England's daughter in marriage, but is told &s;he is dead; and advi&s;ed, by the King, to go to Scotland, and addre&s;s the Scotch Queen <HI>Hermetrude,</HI> with a view that this lady, who was of a cruel ca&s;t, and abhorred all propo&s;als of marriage, might order him to be a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, as &s;he had done &s;ome others before. But <HI>Hamlet</HI> &s;ucceeds better, marries her, and returns with her to England, and being there informed by the prince&s;s to whom he had been betrothed, that her father meditated his death; to avoid danger, cloathed him&s;elf in armour under his robe; &s;lew the King of England, mar|ried the prince&s;s, and &s;ailed to Denmark with his two wives, but was &s;oon after killed in a combat with his uncle by his mother's &s;ide.</P>
<P>Ro&s;kild was formerly the royal re&s;idence, and metro|polis of Denmark, and contained 27 churches, and as many convents. At pre&s;ent it is &s;carce half an Engli&s;h mile round, and has not more than 1,620 inhabitants. The hou&s;es are brick, and look neat. The only re|mains
<PB N="83" REF="89">
of its original grandeur, are the ruins of the palace, and the cathedral, which is a brick-building with two &s;pires, and in which the Kings of Denmark are buried. It was erected by <HI>Harold</HI> VI. King of England and Den|mark, who died in 980, and is interred here. Indeed the church is full of monuments of &s;ucceeding Kings.</P>
<P>There is a &s;pring of &s;uch fine, whole&s;ome water in this place, that &s;ome is carried daily to Copenhagen, for the u&s;e of the court.</P>
<P>Oden&s;ee, the capital of the I&s;le of Funen, is a city of &s;uch high antiquity, that Dani&s;h antiquarians derive its foundation from <HI>Oden,</HI> the god of the Gothic nations. It contains about 5,200 inhabitants, who carry on a trade in grain and leather; is a bi&s;hoprick, and has four churches, be&s;ides the cathedral. The King has here a &s;mall palace.</P>
<P>Wiburg is the capital of North Jutland, is a bi&s;hop's &s;ee, and the re&s;idence of a general-governor. This is one of the mo&s;t ancient cities of the kingdom, and had formerly 12 churches, which are now reduced to three. It has three market-places, and 28 &s;treets.</P>
<P>Sle&s;wick is the capital of South Jutland, and is the re&s;idence of the governor and &s;tate-officers. It is &s;ituated in a mo&s;t charming, plea&s;ant country, and is built in the form of a cre&s;cent; it is between two and
<PB N="84" REF="90">
three Engli&s;h miles in length, and contains about 5,630 inhabitants. The hou&s;es are of brick, and, in neatne&s;s and manner, re&s;emble a Dutch town. The inhabitants dre&s;s al&s;o like the Dutch, and many of them &s;peak that language. Clo&s;e to Sle&s;wick is the old palace of Gottorp, formerly the ducal re&s;idence, but now inhabited by the governor, Prince <HI>Charles,</HI> of He&s;&s;e Ca&s;&s;el. It is a large brick-building, &s;urrounded by a rampart, and a moat. The city had formerly &s;even pari&s;h-churches, and &s;ix convents; but now one can &s;carce trace out the places where many of them &s;tood. The cathedral is a grand &s;tructure, both within and without, but has neither &s;teeple nor tower.</P>
<P>There are many palaces in Denmark. Frederick&s;|burg is a magnificent &s;tructure, &s;ituated on a hill, a &s;mall di&s;tance from Copenhagen. It is &s;pacious on all &s;ides, and has an exceeding fine pro&s;pect. The garden, which lies below the hill, is very exten&s;ive, and contains a great number of plea&s;ant walks, &s;everal groves, a la|byrinth, a theatre, a great many &s;tatues, fountains, and &s;ummer-hou&s;es, and a fine ca&s;cade. From the palace the de&s;cent is by two flights of broad &s;tone-&s;teps to the garden, in which is a menagery, &s;tocked with &s;everal uncommon animals, lion, tygers, &amp;c. with an orangery and a yard with phea&s;ants and falcons. From this palace, a plea&s;ant avenue, planted with a double row of trees, extends half way to Copenhagen. To this account of <HI>Bu&s;ching,</HI> we will add <HI>Wraxhall's,</HI> who de&s;cribes it as a

a large chateau, moated round with a triple ditch. It was founded by <HI>Frederick</HI> the Fourth. It partakes of the Greek and Gothic &s;tyles; but, in the front of the grand quadrangle are Tu&s;can and Doric pillars, and on the &s;ummit, &s;pires and turrets. Some of the rooms are &s;plendid, though furni&s;hed in the antique ta&s;te, but it is little vi&s;ited by the pre&s;ent family.</P>
<P>Jager&s;burg is a royal hunting &s;eat, where the hunting officers re&s;ide, and where is a repo&s;itory for all hunting implements. The park is rather a wood, or fore&s;t, very exten&s;ive, and full of game. In the middle is an edifice, called the Hermitage, 30 ells long, and 20 broad, very elegantly decorated. In the lowe&s;t &s;tory is a curious machine, by which the dinner, &amp;c. is conveyed up and down, to and from the King's table, in the &s;econd &s;tory.</P>
<P>The palace of Cronberg &s;tands in the fortre&s;s of that place, about 20 miles from Copenhagen. It is a &s;quare Gothic building, of free-&s;tone, and was the pri&s;on of the late unfortunate Queen <HI>Matilda,</HI> the &s;i&s;ter of our pre&s;ent Sovereign of England.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Of the People, their Cu&s;toms, and Manners.</HEAD>
<P><HI>MOLESWORTH</HI> has been always con&s;idered as the mo&s;t candid and accurate writer on the &s;tate of Denmark, at the time in which he wrote, but this was near 100 years ago; and <HI>Mar&s;hall</HI> declares that almo&s;t every circum&s;tance is &s;o e&s;&s;entially changed &s;ince his time, that little related by him can be depended upon, as to the &s;tate of Denmark at the pre&s;ent hour.</P>
<P>By a numeration of the people in 1759, the &s;ubjects of Denmark, Norway, Hol&s;tein, the i&s;lands in the Baltick, and the di&s;tricts of Oldenburgh and Delmenhur&s;t, in We&s;tphalia, amounted to 2,444,000 exclu&s;ive of the inhabitants of Iceland, Greenland, and the Dani&s;h colo|nies.</P>
<P>From all the opportunities, &s;ays <HI>Mar&s;hall,</HI> which I have had of &s;eeing and conver&s;ing with the Danes, and which I have done with all ranks, they appear to be a brave, courteous, and humane people. The upper cla&s;s have a high &s;pirit, value them&s;elves upon the titles and privileges they derive from the Crown, and are accordingly fond of &s;hew and magnificence. They have
<PB N="87" REF="93">
as much vivacity as any people in Europe, except the French nobility, and live in a mean between the Engli&s;h and the Germans, more &s;umptuous than the latter, but not with &s;uch a general con&s;i&s;tency as the former. In their dre&s;s, and even in their gallantry, they endeavour to imitate the French, though they are a complete contra&s;t to that nation; and the French lan|guage is univer&s;al among them. In their hou&s;es, they are not only expen&s;ive in the building them, but al&s;o in furni&s;hing them, exceeding the Germans, but not equalling the Engli&s;h. At their tables they re&s;emble the Germans in cookery, but do not &s;it &s;o long at their meals. In Germany, four cour&s;es and a de&s;ert, will take up four hours and a half, which in England is di&s;patched in one hour; but the Danes &s;eldom ri&s;e from table under two hours. Some of the nobility have French cooks, and in their wines are expen&s;ive and curious. Their tables are well covered with fi&s;h of the be&s;t &s;orts, abun|dance of wild fowl, and fine veni&s;on; but their butchers-meat is not equal to ours. They have hot-hou&s;es and hot walls, fronted with gla&s;s, and, of cour&s;e, all the luxu|ries which the&s;e afford.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd cla&s;s of people, there is a much greater difference between them and the &s;ame rank in England, than between the Dani&s;h and Engli&s;h nobility: they are not &s;o comfortable in their circum&s;tances; &s;carce any of the gentry are ma&s;ters of &s;uch e&s;tates, as to put them on
<PB N="88" REF="94">
a par with the nobles, and, of cour&s;e, they do not make a proportionable appearance.</P>
<P>The lower cla&s;s are &s;till more inferior than the Eng|li&s;h, and cannot be compared to the common people here, either for ea&s;e or happine&s;s; yet they are by no means in that &s;tate of va&s;&s;alage, as they were in <HI>Mole&s;|worth</HI>'s time; &s;everal edicts having been publi&s;hed by the Crown, for re&s;training the ancient villenage; and as to the common people, in towns and cities, they are as free as in other ab&s;olute dominions.</P>
<P>In per&s;on, the lower cla&s;s is, in general, as well made, and, as &s;tout, as the Germans. They make good &s;oldiers, and with gentle u&s;age, are docile and tractable; but, in villages, they are ignorant and clowni&s;h, yet good hu&s;|bandmen.</P>
<P>The Dani&s;h army finds employment for young men of &s;mall fortune. The employments about court pro|vide for others, and many freely embark for the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies, are remarkable active and diligent, and often return home, with good fortunes. The gentry &s;eem extremely di&s;po&s;ed to treat a &s;tranger with every mark of urbanity and politene&s;s; but an Engli&s;hman, at court, is at pre&s;ent received with great coldne&s;s.</P>
<P>In their amu&s;ements, the Danes follow the fa&s;hions of the French and Engli&s;h; cards lead the way, and &s;uch
<PB N="89" REF="95">
ladies as can afford it, have at Copenhagen, their a&s;|&s;emblies almo&s;t as regularly as any in London. The men are great che&s;s-players; billiards and tenis are favourite diver&s;ions. They have a French theatre, and a Dani&s;h one, where tran&s;lations from the Engli&s;h and French are indifferently performed. Attempts have been made for an Italian Opera, but with little &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Copenhagen principally flouri&s;hes from the re&s;idence of the court, which is much the mo&s;t brilliant object in Denmark. There are many great officers of &s;tate, which, with the numerous inferior ones, and the guards, render the town very gay.</P>
<P><HI>Mole&s;worth</HI> gives us an account of the following cu&s;|toms and amu&s;ements, which, as they are not noticed or contradicted by later writers, we may &s;uppo&s;e &s;till exi&s;t, or with little alteration; for we find, in all countries, pro|vincial cu&s;toms and fe&s;tivities are pre&s;erved for ages; and as they will enliven the &s;cene, I &s;hall lay them before my reader.</P>
<P>The ordinary diver&s;ions of the court are progre&s;&s;es, which are made once a quarter, at lea&s;t, to Sle&s;wick or Hol&s;tein, either to review the troops, or in&s;pect the for|tifications at Rend&s;burg. The&s;e are no expence to the trea&s;ury, as waggons and hor&s;es are found by the boors, who al&s;o pay a per&s;onal attendance, and are ready for all nece&s;&s;ary &s;ervices, for five or &s;ix weeks every &s;um|mer.
<PB N="90" REF="96">
The court removes to Jager&s;burg, a &s;mall hunt|ing &s;eat, &s;ituated on a &s;mall lake, its foundation in the water, not far from the &s;ea, and within four Engli&s;h miles of Copenhagen; and for five or &s;ix weeks more it re&s;ides at Frederick&s;burg, the chief country-palace of the Kings of Denmark; which has a fine park about it, well filled with red deer, embelli&s;hed with fine ponds and lofty trees; but yet it falls &s;hort of many of our noble|men's country-&s;eats in England. At Frederick&s;burg the court &s;pends mo&s;t of its time in &s;tag-hunting; when the King lays a&s;ide all formalities, and eats and drinks freely with his dome&s;tics: and, after a hard day's hunting, they will often adjourn to the wine-cellar, and there drink to exce&s;s. About five or &s;ix in the afternoon the hunt|ing a&s;&s;izes are &s;olemnly held in the great court before the palace; the &s;tag is drawn into the mid&s;t of it by the hunt&s;men, who are all clothed in red, with great bra&s;s hunting-horns, about their necks; and is there broken up with great ceremony, whil&s;t the hounds attend with much noi&s;e and impatience. One that is mo&s;t likely to fee the hunt&s;man be&s;t, is invited to take e&s;&s;ay, and is pre&s;ented with the deer's foot. Then the proclamation is made: If any one can inform the King (who is both &s;upreme judge and executioner) of any tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion again&s;t the known laws of hunting that day committed, let him &s;tand forth and accu&s;e; the accu&s;ed is generally found guilty; and then two gentlemen lead him to the &s;tag, and make him kneel down between the horns, turning down his head, with his breech up, and removing the

&s;kirts of his coat, his Maje&s;ty, with a &s;mall, long wand, gives the offender &s;ome la&s;hes on his po&s;teriors; whil&s;t the hunt&s;men, with their bra&s;s horns, and the dogs, with their loud openings, proclaim the King's ju&s;tice, and the criminals puni&s;hment; the queen, ladies, and others, &s;tanding round in a circle, as &s;pectators. This is as often repeated, as there happens to be delinquents; who as &s;oon as the cha&s;ti&s;ement is over, ri&s;e up and make their obey&s;ance,

After all is over, the hounds are permitted to fall to, and devour the deer.</P>
<P>At another &s;ea&s;on, &s;wan-hunting is the royal pa&s;time. Wild &s;wans haunt a certain i&s;land, not far from Copen|hagen, and breed there. About the time, when the young ones are near as large as the old, before their feathers are grown long enough to fly, the King, with the queen, ladies, and others of the court, go to the killing of them: the foreign mini&s;ters are u&s;ually invited to take part in this &s;port. Every per&s;on of condition has a pinnace allotted to him; and, when they come near the haunt, they &s;urround the place, and inclo&s;e a great multitude of young &s;wans, which they de&s;troy with guns, till they have killed &s;ome thou&s;ands. What is killed by

the whole company, is brought to the court, which claims the feathers and down, the fle&s;h being good for nothing.</P>
<P>On Shrove-Tue&s;day, the King, queen, royal family, home and foreign mini&s;ters, and &s;tate-officers that compo&s;e the court, clothe them&s;eves in the habit of the North Holland boors, with great trunk-ho&s;e, &s;hort doublets, and large, blue thrum-caps; the ladies in blue petticoats, and odd head-dre&s;&s;es, &amp;c. and, thus accoutred, get up in their waggons, a man before and a woman behind, driving them&s;elves, and go to a country-village, called Amack, about three miles from town, where they dance to the &s;ound of bag-pipes, and &s;queaking fiddles, and have a country-dinner, which they eat out of earthen and wooden platters, with wooden &s;poons, &amp;c. and, hav|ing pa&s;&s;ed the day in the&s;e diver&s;ions, where all are equal, with little regard to Maje&s;ty, they return home at night in the &s;ame manner, and are entertained at a comedy and magnificent &s;upper and ball, in the &s;ame dre&s;s as they wore the whole day.</P>
<P>Every winter, as &s;oon as the &s;now is firm enough to bear, the Danes take to their &s;ledges for amu&s;ement, the King and court fir&s;t giving the example; for &s;o great a re&s;pect do they bear to maje&s;ty, that they never cro&s;s a new bridge, till the king has fir&s;t cro&s;&s;ed it: nay, all the clocks of Copenhagen &s;trike the hours after the court clock. The court then fir&s;t make their appearance in

their &s;ledges, making &s;everal tours about town, in great pomp, with kettle-drums and trumpets; the hor&s;es which draw the &s;ledges, being richly adorned with trap|pings and harne&s;s, full of &s;mall bells, to give warning to &s;uch as &s;tand in their way. After the court has been thus abroad, the burghers, and others, trot about the &s;treets all night, in their fur-gowns, with each his female in the &s;ledge with him, and this they e&s;teem a great and plea&s;ant amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>In travelling to Frederick&s;burg, Jager&s;burg, and many other places, from Copenhagen, there are two high roads, one for the people, which is commonly bad, and another for the King, in good condition; but others, who can procure a key to the gates, are indulged with pa&s;&s;ing on the latter.</P>
<P>The vehicles, &s;ays <HI>Wraxhall,</HI> for travelling, are an in|definable &s;omewhat, begot by a coach upon a cart, and partaking very much of both kinds; are drawn by four little Dani&s;h hor&s;es, and, what with whipping and &s;pur|ring, they make &s;hift to travel about four Engli&s;h miles and a half an hour.</P>
<P>It is a difficult matter, &s;ays <HI>Mole&s;worth,</HI> for &s;trangers to find conveniences of lodging or eating in Denmark; even in Copenhagen, there are few, if any, lodgings to let in private hou&s;es; and, in the taverns, a man mu&s;t be con|tented
<PB N="94" REF="101">
to eat and drink in a public room, with other company, and at the &s;ame table.</P>
<P>Among all the hard&s;hips which are impo&s;ed on the pea&s;antry of Denmark, &s;ays <HI>Mole&s;worth,</HI> that of the obli|gation they lie under, of furni&s;hing the royal family, and all their attendants, with hor&s;es and travelling waggons, is one of the greate&s;t. Whenever the court travels, the pea&s;ants that lie near the road, or in that di&s;trict, are &s;ummoned to attend, with their hor&s;es and waggons, at certain &s;tages, where they are to relieve each other; and this they often do, always at their own expence, for two or three days together; no regard being had to the &s;ea&s;on, which is generally harve&s;t-time, or to any other conve|nience of the&s;e poor wretches. I have frequently &s;een them, with hundreds of waggons, in a company, attend|ing the arrival of the court, bewailing their &s;ad condi|tion; and, as &s;oon as their King comes up, and his coaches, with tho&s;e of his attendants, &s;ix or eight boors hor&s;es, not much larger then calves, are put to each coach, and every lackey of the King's &s;uite then &s;eizes on a boor and waggon for his own u&s;e; when, unle&s;s the poor, trembling pea&s;ant does every thing to plea&s;e his em|ployer, by driving on and taking all patiently, without a reply, he is beaten and abu&s;ed. Nor is this only the ca&s;e when the King travels, but when he plea&s;es to grant his warrant to any officer or man of rank, that has a journey to make.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="102">The tables of the better &s;ort are generally well &s;erved, but their meat is lean, and, excepting their beaf and veal, ill-ta&s;ted. Wether-mutton is very &s;carce, and &s;el|dom good; wild ducks &s;carcely eatable, and plovers never. Here are no wild phea&s;ants, woodcocks, rabbits, or fallow-deer. Red deer are the King's game, and not to be purcha&s;ed. Hares, however, are good, and their bacon is excellent. Sea-fi&s;h is &s;carce, and not good; but river-fi&s;h makes amends for all, here being the be&s;t carp, perch, and craw-fi&s;h that are to be found any where. Fine fruit, &s;o far north, is not to be expected: but the gentry, who pride them&s;elves in their gardens, have &s;uch as is tolerable, and have melons, grapes, peaches, and all &s;orts of &s;allad, very early. Their butter is good, but their chee&s;e indifferent, and their cookery far from plea&s;ing to an Engli&s;h palate.</P>
<P><HI>Mole&s;worth</HI> gives us the following account of the fir&s;t green goo&s;e that was ever eaten in Denmark. He &s;ays, that the common people are mean-&s;pirited, and &s;o in|clined to cheating, that they &s;u&s;pect others of doing the &s;ame; &s;o that, if you offer them a great price for a thing, which they have not been u&s;ed to &s;ell, they will refu&s;e to part with it, &s;u&s;pecting that you &s;ee an advantage in the purcha&s;e, as yet unknown to them, and which they hope to find out. "Seeing great flocks of green gee&s;e," &s;ays his Lord&s;hip, "in the fields near the town, I &s;ent to buy &s;ome; but, they not being u&s;ed to &s;ell or eat gee&s;e in that country, till they are full grown, could not
<PB N="96" REF="103">
be per&s;uaded to part with one, though double the price of a full-grown goo&s;e was bid for it. They inquired, Why we wi&s;hed to buy them? What we meant to do with them? &amp;c. for they would not believe any one would be &s;o fooli&s;h as to eat them, whil&s;t young and &s;mall. However, a week after, an old woman, to whom money had been offered for a dozen, came and brought me four to &s;ell, &s;aying, that neither &s;he nor her gee&s;e had thriven, &s;ince &s;he refu&s;ed to &s;ell them at a good price; for a kite had, the night before, killed eight of her &s;tock, and that now the remaining four were at my &s;ervice. Thus the &s;uper&s;tition of this old woman, occa|&s;ioned the fir&s;t green goo&s;e to be brought to market; for after that they found the Engli&s;h fattened them and killed them for the table, the market was never without them; where they will a&s;k the &s;ame price for &s;tinking meat as for fre&s;h; for lean meat as for fat. The &s;ure way not to obtain, is to &s;eem eager to purcha&s;e; and indeed, among all cla&s;&s;es of the people, to a&s;k a thing importu|nately, is the certain method of not having it complied with, though otherwi&s;e, the per&s;on a&s;ked would be de&s;ir|ous of its being done.</P>
<P>According to lord <HI>Mole&s;worth,</HI> the King of Den|mark's court, as to pomp and magnificence, can &s;carcely be called a royal one. The luxury and extravagance of &s;outhern courts had not, in his time, reached &s;o far north. In this court, no en&s;igns of maje&s;ty appear, let the oc|ca&s;ion be ever &s;o &s;olemn, except &s;uch as are military.
<PB N="97" REF="104">
All tho&s;e which a &s;tanding army can afford, &s;uch as hor&s;e and foot-guards; trabans, which an&s;wer to our beef-eaters; kettle-drums, and trumpets, &amp;c. are there in perfection, and in u&s;e every day, as much as in camp; but badges of peace, as &s;words of &s;tate, heralds, maces, chancellor's pur&s;e, &amp;c. are not known.</P>
<P>The King &s;its down to dinner with his family and general officers of the army, till his table is full. The Court-mare&s;chal invites whom he plea&s;es to eat with the King, till all have had the honour in turns. A page in livery &s;ays grace, before and after meat; for no chaplain appears, either here, or in any of the prote&s;tant courts abroad, but in the pulpit. The attendants are one or two gentlemen, and the re&s;t livery-&s;ervants. No ceremony of the knee is u&s;ed to the King. The kettle-drums and trum|pets, which are ranged in a large place before the palace, proclaim aloud the very minute when he &s;its down to table.</P>
<P>The city of Copenhagen is under very good regula|tions. There are &s;elect companies appointed to watch and extingui&s;h fires; no per&s;ons daring to approach within a certain di&s;tance, le&s;t, under a pretence of a&s;&s;i&s;ting, they &s;hould plunder. Chimney-&s;weepers are obliged to keep a regi&s;ter of all chimnies they &s;weep, that, in ca&s;e of any accident, tho&s;e, by who&s;e neglect or covetou&s;ne&s;s it hap|pens, may be an&s;werable for it. No torches or flambeaus are allowed to be carried in the &s;treets, on account of
<PB N="98" REF="105">
the great quantities of fir, timber, and the con&s;tant high winds that are here; in&s;tead of which, all per&s;ons u&s;e large, round lanthorns, carried at the end of long &s;ticks.</P>
<P>Among other good regulations, that of the apothe|caries is none of the lea&s;t commendable; for, no one is permitted to exerci&s;e this trade, unle&s;s appointed by the college of phy&s;icians, and confirmed by the King him|&s;elf. There are but two allowed in the whole city of Copenhagen, and one to every other con&s;iderable town. Their &s;hops and drugs are carefully in&s;pected twice or thrice a year by the magi&s;trates, accompanied by the phy&s;icians; and &s;uch drugs as are of no efficacy, or &s;poilt by age, are taken from them, and flung away. The prices of the&s;e drugs are al&s;o fixed, &s;o that a child may be &s;ent to an apothecary's &s;hop without being im|po&s;ed on; and nothing is &s;old, that is not exceedingly good, and at very moderate rates. They &s;ell all for ready money, yet keep an account of what they &s;ell, to whom, and by who&s;e pre&s;cription; &s;o that the great mi&s;|chief of accidental or wilful poi&s;oning, is either prevented, or, if practi&s;ed, ea&s;ily di&s;covered and puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>They are much addicted, &s;ays <HI>Mole&s;worth,</HI> to drink|ing, and the liquors mo&s;t in fa&s;hion, in his time, were Rheni&s;h-wine, cherry-brandy, and all &s;orts of French wines. The men are fond of them, and the women do not refu&s;e them. The poor, who are able to indulge, do it in bad beer, and Dani&s;h brandy, di&s;tilled from barley.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="106">Apoplexies and the falling &s;ickne&s;s are the epidemical di&s;tempers here; and one &s;hall &s;carce pa&s;s through Copenhagen, without &s;eeing one or two poor creatures in a fit, in the &s;treets, with a circle of gazers and a&s;&s;i&s;t|ants about them. It is very u&s;ual here to have them die of a <HI>&s;lacht,</HI> as they call it, which is an apoplexy, proceeding from trouble of mind; but, on the other hand, few, or none, are afflicted with coughs, catarrhs, or con&s;umptions, &s;o common in this country; &s;o that, in Denmark, the preachers are never di&s;turbed at church, as in England.</P>
<P>Their marriages, &s;ays <HI>Mole&s;worth,</HI> are u&s;ually pre|ceded by contracts, which will la&s;t, &s;ometimes, three or four or more years, before they proceed to a public wedding by the mini&s;ters; though often the young couple grow better acquainted before the&s;e formalities are di&s;patched.

<P>Sumptuous burials and monuments are general among the nobility; and it is u&s;ual to keep the corp&s;e of a per&s;on of quality in a vault, or the chancel of &s;ome church, for &s;everal years, till a fit opportunity offers to to celebrate the funeral.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of their Trade and Manufactures.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING already &s;poken of the trade of Norway, I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to the kingdom of Denmark, which is extremely well &s;ituated for commerce, her harbours well adapted for &s;hips of great burden, and her &s;eamen very expert in navigation. But Denmark po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es very few commodities for exportation. It is, how|ever, very rich in timber, and other materials for &s;hip-building, with which it &s;upplies other nations, be&s;ides its own. There is no compari&s;on between the pre&s;ent trade of Denmark, and what it was 50 years ago. Scarcely any thing has been omitted by government, that could promote and enlarge its commerce. Be&s;ides the regi&s;try of &s;hips, and the increa&s;e of the number and tonnage of them, there have been numerous advantages given to trade, which are &s;hewn in mo&s;t of the branches of the nation's dealing with other countries. They have an Ea&s;t India-company, who&s;e trade is increa&s;ing, and
<PB N="101" REF="108">
profits con&s;iderable and regular. Their We&s;t-India colonies thrive more than ever, and a ri&s;e in the crown-revenues, and an increa&s;e of &s;hipping and population, is the be&s;t criterion of an improvement of their general commerce.</P>
<P>In 1755, an African company was e&s;tabli&s;hed, and in 1736, a loan-bank was erected, where great or &s;mall &s;ums, not under 100 rix-dollars, are lent, on pledges, at four <HI>per cent.</HI></P>
<P>They export, now, fir, and other timber, black cattle, &s;tock-fi&s;h, tallow, hides, train-oil, tar, pitch, iron, and furs, and import &s;alt, wine, brandy, and &s;ilk, from France, Portugal, and Italy; broad-cloths, clocks, cabinet-work, locks, &amp;c. from England. They po&s;&s;e&s;s the i&s;lands of St. Croix, St. Thomas, and the &s;mall i&s;land of St. John, in the We&s;t-Indies; which are free ports, renowned for &s;muggling, and the fort of Chri&s;tianburg, on the coa&s;t of Guinea, and carry on a con&s;iderable com|merce with the Mediterranean.</P>
<P>Of the Baltick &s;ea they have in a great mea&s;ure the command, being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the pa&s;&s;age of the Sound, which is a narrow &s;treight, between two and three miles over, between Sweden and Denmark, through which all &s;hips pa&s;s and repa&s;s, to and from the Baltick. This pa&s;s is guarded by the fortre&s;s of Cronberg. A toll is paid to the Crown of Denmark, by all &s;hips that pa&s;s this way.
<PB N="102" REF="109">
This toll &s;eems to have taken its ri&s;e, and to have been fir&s;t laid on, by con&s;ent of the traders into the Baltick, for the maintenance of light-hou&s;es, at certain places on that coa&s;t. And though there is another pa&s;&s;age into this &s;ea, by a &s;treight between the i&s;lands of Funen and Seeland, called the Great-belt, yet, that was di&s;u&s;ed, and &s;hips, by the &s;ame con&s;ent, were obliged to pa&s;s the Sound, that they might all pay their quota towards the &s;upport of &s;uch lights. But there being no fixed rule or treaty, with re&s;pect to the &s;ums to be paid by the many nations that pa&s;&s;ed this way, the Danes, in proce&s;s of time, grew arbitrary, and exacted more or le&s;s, accord|ing to the &s;trength, or weakne&s;s, of tho&s;e they had to deal with, or according to their friend&s;hip with tho&s;e &s;tates, to whom the &s;everal &s;hips belonged. Many have been the treaties re&s;pecting this toll within the&s;e 200 years; and the King of Denmark's title to the right of exacting it, is now &s;o &s;lightly grounded, and his not having po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the ca&s;tle of Hel&s;ingburg, in Sweden, on the other &s;ide, which once he had, that it is continued only by favour, and the public law of Europe. It has been generally a&s;&s;erted, that the ca&s;tle of Cronberg guards the Sound; and that all &s;hips mu&s;t, on account of the &s;hoal-water and currents, &s;teer &s;o near the batteries, as to be expo&s;ed to their fire: but this is not the ca&s;e; on account of the numerous and oppo&s;ite currents, the &s;afe&s;t pa&s;&s;age is near the fortre&s;s, but the water, in any part, is of &s;ufficient depth for ve&s;&s;els to keep at a di&s;tance from the batteries; and the large&s;t &s;hips can even &s;ail clo&s;e to
<PB N="103" REF="110">
the coa&s;t of Sweden: but the &s;everal nations con&s;ent to pay a &s;mall toll, from one to one and a half <HI>per cent.</HI> on their cargoes, and every &s;hip lowers her top-&s;ails as &s;he pa&s;&s;es. The Danes, however, are obliged to take the ma&s;ter of the ve&s;&s;el's word, for the quality and quantity of the lading, and find it prudent not to be too &s;trict in their enquiries; but, if the Engli&s;h and Dutch were to refu&s;e payment, other &s;tates would &s;oon do the &s;ame, and the chain would be broken. To prevent ve&s;&s;els pa&s;&s;ing by the Greater or Le&s;&s;er Belt, without paying equal toll, men of war are there &s;tationed, &s;o chat the profits of the Sound amount to about 100,000 <HI>l.</HI> a year.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t century, there were &s;carce any manufactures carried on in Denmark, but now there are arti&s;ts of great eminence at Copenhagen, and every branch of mecha|nic arts is well executed throughout the kingdom. Gold and &s;ilver-lace, &s;ilk &s;tuffs and velvets, cloths, cotton and woollen &s;tuffs, &s;tockings, tape&s;try, hats, ba&s;tard and genuine porcelain and fire-arms, are there manufactured. There are al&s;o paper and copper-mills, different &s;orts of iron-wares made, &s;ilk and cotton printing-hou&s;es, with manufactories of &s;oap, &s;teel, &s;tarch, glue, lacker, tobacco, &s;ugar, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In 1738, a general warehou&s;e or magazine was opened at the Exchange, in Copenhagen, to which manufactu|rers bring all the wares, which they cannot di&s;po&s;e of in other towns, and are paid ready money for them; and
<PB N="104" REF="111">
from this warehou&s;e the goods are delivered out on credit to retailers.</P>
<P>The po&s;t-office is on a very regular footing. In all towns the couriers for letters go out and come in twice a week. There are travelling po&s;t-carriages; and at every town, a per&s;on may hire one for him&s;elf at a rea|&s;onable fixed rate. The roads are mea&s;ured all over the kingdom, and, at every quarter of a Dani&s;h mile, the ground is a little rai&s;ed, and a &s;tone erected on it.</P>
<P>The Danes are no proficients in the fine arts, not having encouragement enough to make any progre&s;s. The kingdom, &s;ays <HI>Mar&s;hall,</HI> is too poor to yield a mar|ket even to fir&s;t portrait-painters; the only art that makes any decent figure at Copenhagen, is mu&s;ic; where &s;ome very capital German and Italian performers meet with pretty good encouragement.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Of their Languages, Learning, and Religion.</HEAD>
<P>THE Dani&s;h language is merely a dialect of the Swedi&s;h and Norwegian, and the inhabitants of the&s;e three northern kingdoms under&s;tand each other, excepting in &s;ome few words and phra&s;es. With regard to
<PB N="105" REF="112">
the pronunciation it has a perfect affinity with the Eng|li&s;h, is not unlike the whining, unplea&s;ing, tone of the Iri&s;h; has many mono&s;yllables, the &s;ame with the Engli&s;h, in which our's originated. The court, and many burghers, &s;peak Dutch in common conver&s;ation, and French to &s;trangers, and the nobility have made great advances in Engli&s;h, which is now taught as a branch of polite and nece&s;&s;ary education. A company of Engli&s;h players occa&s;ionally vi&s;it Copenhagen, and find good encou|ragement.</P>
<P>The number of learned men in Denmark is as con&s;i|derable as in any other country in Europe of the &s;ame extent, and where the &s;ciences are in a flouri&s;hing &s;tate. There is &s;carce any branch of literature, in which men of genius have not acquitted them&s;elves with honour. This is the language of <HI>Bu&s;ching;</HI> but <HI>Mar&s;hall</HI> &s;ays, learning of all kinds is but at a low ebb. Denmark certainly produced formerly very learned men, for in&s;tance, the famous mathematician <HI>Tycho Brahe,</HI> of whom they are now &s;o proud, as to pre&s;erve, among&s;t the mo&s;t va|luable of their curio&s;ities, the chair in which he u&s;ed to &s;it, when he made his a&s;tronomical ob&s;ervations at Ura|nibourg, and the wood which compo&s;es it, is held in reverence. They can boa&s;t al&s;o of the <HI>Bartholines</HI> for phy&s;ic and anatomy, and <HI>Borichius,</HI> who bequeathed a con&s;iderable legacy to the univer&s;ity of Copenhagen. Their Icelandic authors I have &s;poken of, when treating
<PB N="106" REF="113">
of that i&s;land; but I mu&s;t not omit <HI>Chri&s;tian Oeder,</HI> to whom we are indebted for the <HI>Flora Danica.</HI></P>
<P>The Kings of Denmark have occa&s;ionally deputed, and &s;till continue to &s;end, at their expence, learned men through their own territories, and into various parts of the world, for the purpo&s;e of extending the bounds of knowledge.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the univer&s;ity at Copenhagen, which con|&s;i&s;ts of four &s;pacious colleges, that of Kiel, at Soroe, for noblemen's children, and the <HI>Gymna&s;ia,</HI> or &s;eminaries at Oden&s;ee and Altona, there are &s;everal &s;chools well en|dowed in country-towns, where the ma&s;ters are not only liberally provided for, but the &s;cholars are al&s;o in&s;tructed, and partly maintained, <HI>gratis.</HI> In this univer&s;ity, the profe&s;&s;ors have liberal &s;alaries, and many of the &s;tudents have apartments and in&s;truction free.</P>
<P>At Copenhagen is al&s;o a royal academy of &s;ciences, e&s;tabli&s;hed in 1743, who have publi&s;hed 15 volumes of their tran&s;actions; and a &s;ociety for the improvement of northern hi&s;tory and languages. Here is likewi&s;e two &s;chools for the children of the nobility and gentry, who&s;e fortunes are too circum&s;cribed to bear the expence of a proper education, one is for boys, the other for girls; at that for boys, the day &s;cholars pay only 6<HI>l.</HI> a year, and the boarders 20<HI>l.</HI> They learn hi&s;tory, geography, and arithmetic, are in&s;tructed in the articles of their religion;
<PB N="107" REF="114">
and have ma&s;ters for the German, French, and Engli&s;h languages.</P>
<P>Lutherani&s;m is the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of the country; but, in Copenhagen, the Calvini&s;ts have a church to them&s;elves; the Papi&s;ts frequent the chapels of foreign Roman-catholic mini&s;ters, and the Jews have a &s;yna|gogue. It is a ble&s;&s;ing which Denmark enjoys, that the people, in general, have but one faith, which prevents all factions and di&s;putes about religion. So that the Prince is little inconvenienced; for as long as the prie&s;ts are dependent on the Crown, and the people, in matters of con&s;cience, governed by the prie&s;ts, as is the ca&s;e here, the Sovereign may be as arbitrary as he plea&s;es: and, in con&s;ideration of this advantage, the clergy are much favoured, and &s;uffered to &s;ink into bigotry. The clergy, however, are not admitted into civil affairs, nor have they any thing to do with government; the pulpit only is left free to them, and here they tyrannize, not only taking va&s;t liberties of reprehending vices, but cen&s;uring and la&s;hing particular per&s;ons of the highe&s;t rank, which is pa&s;&s;ed unnoticed, whil&s;t they interfere not with &s;tate-matters. The common people admire them for this bold|ne&s;s, and the be&s;t part of their income ari&s;ing from the voluntary contributions of the people, they take care to cultivate the good opinion of the mob; whom they keep, at the &s;ame time, in awe, by the practice of con|fe&s;&s;ion before they admini&s;ter the &s;acrament, which every one that receives is obliged to undergo. They do not

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Of their Government, Laws, Forces, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>TILL the revolution in 1660, the crown of Den|mark was elective, and the government a kind of ari&s;tocracy, but in that year, it was changed to as ab&s;olutely a monarchy as any in the world. The Sove|reign is now declared as independent upon earth, acknow|ledge no higher power than God; he has an unlimited authority, to make, alter, repeal, and di&s;pen&s;e with laws; can make peace and declare war, form alliances, and levy taxes; in &s;hort, he enjoys all the rights and pre|rogatives which an hereditary, ab&s;olute, and de&s;potic king can enjoy.</P>
<P>Five per&s;ons compo&s;e the King's privy-council. Four of them are con&s;tantly at court, and the fifth at Ham|burgh, by the weekly advices of whom, the others gene|rally regulate all their deliberations. Hamburgh is a kind of commonwealth of its own, but the kings of
<PB N="111" REF="118">
Denmark &s;till lay claim to certain privileges within its walls.</P>
<P>The Danes are divided into nobles, burghers, and pea&s;ants, and the noble&s;&s;e is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the appel|lations of the <HI>higher</HI> and <HI>lower</HI> nobility. In the rank of higher nobles are counts and barons, for there are no dukes or princes. Counts have the right of <HI>primo geni|ture.</HI> Their younger &s;ons and daughters are &s;tiled barons and barone&s;&s;es: in their counties they have the right of patronage, and of appointing a judge and &s;ecretary, from who&s;e &s;entence there is no appeal but to the &s;u|preme court of judicature. They pay no contributions or tithes for their e&s;tates in chief, and are allowed 300 acres of land, over and above, free from all impo&s;itions. Barons have &s;imilar privileges, only not &s;o exten&s;ive. Lords of manors, have, be&s;ides their manors, 200 acres of land, within two miles of their manors, free from contribution. Burghers are the freemen of towns; and pea&s;ants an&s;wer to our freeholders and copyholders.</P>
<P>There are here two orders of knighthood, the prin|cipal is that of the Elephant, who&s;e en&s;igns are, a &s;ilver &s;tar on the left brea&s;t, and a white enamelled elephant, hung to a blue ribband, worn over the left &s;houlder to the right &s;ide. The &s;econd is the Danebrog order, who&s;e badge is a gold cro&s;s, enamelled, and &s;et with diamonds, hanging to a watered, white ribband, with a red border,
<PB N="112" REF="119">
worn over the right &s;houlder to the left &s;ide, and a &s;ilver-&s;tar.</P>
<P>The country is divided into general governments, called <HI>Stifts-Amts,</HI> and the <HI>Stifts-Amtmann,</HI> or governor, is always a per&s;on of di&s;tinction, generally a knight of one of the orders, and has authority over the revenues, towns, and country, within his juri&s;diction. Under the Stifts-Amtmann are the <HI>Amtmanner,</HI> or prefects, who are al&s;o noblemen. The civil government in the cities and po&s;t-towns is lodged in a burgo-ma&s;ter and council, but in &s;maller towns in the <HI>Byevogt,</HI> or King's head-borough.</P>
<P>The &s;alaries of the judges are but &s;mall, but do not con&s;i&s;t of fees. Every man may, if he plea&s;es, plead his own cau&s;e, in any of the courts; but the poor, and &s;uch as cannot &s;peak for them&s;elves, have advocates ap|pointed for them: in&s;omuch that the charges of the law are &s;o ea&s;y, that a complaint may go through all the courts for le&s;s than 12<HI>l.</HI> &s;terling. The &s;mallne&s;s of the expence, however, is no encouragement to tho&s;e that love going to law, for the laws them&s;elves provide effectu|ally again&s;t the mi&s;chief, and take away the very root of litigiou&s;ne&s;s, being &s;o plain and clear, that a trouble|&s;ome per&s;on never finds his account in promoting vexa|tious &s;uits, but meets with all the di&s;appointments one would wi&s;h him.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="120">Advocates, or coun&s;ellors, are not regularly bred as with us, but any one may take up the profe&s;&s;ion that plea&s;es. The &s;upreme court of judicature, which I have mentioned, is at Copenhagen, where the king &s;its &s;ometimes in per&s;on, and is always compo&s;ed of the prime nobility of the kingdom.</P>
<P>In criminal matters, &s;uch great &s;everity is practi&s;ed, that high-trea&s;on is never heard of; there are no clip|pers or coiners, no robbers on the highway, nor hou&s;e-breakers; the mo&s;t u&s;ual capital crimes are man&s;laughter and &s;tealing, on which occa&s;ion the criminal is beheaded with a &s;word, very dextrou&s;ly by a head&s;man, at one &s;troke, who is, from a variety of offices which he under|takes, generally very rich, though no one will be &s;een in his company. He empties the nece&s;&s;ary-hou&s;es, and removes dead dogs and hor&s;es out of hou&s;es and &s;tables. No Dani&s;h &s;ervant will do this, but the head&s;man un|dertakes it, and performs it by an under-&s;ervant called a <HI>Racker,</HI> and has his own price for &s;o doing. All mi&s;|demeanours are puni&s;hed by &s;ervitude in chains, for a certain length of time.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not omit to take notice, on the authority of lord <HI>Mole&s;worth,</HI> that, in this country, it is only the nobility with titles that have the liberty of making a will, to di&s;po&s;e of any e&s;tate, otherwi&s;e than as the law &s;hall, of cour&s;e, direct; and that &s;uch mu&s;t be approved and &s;igned by the King, during the life of the te&s;tator.</P>

<P>The revenue of the Crown ari&s;es from taxes, cu&s;toms, and crown-lands, the gro&s;s receipt of which amounted, in 1769, to 1,252,454<HI>l.</HI> and the expenditure was 936,130<HI>l.</HI> of which the army e&s;timates come to 350,000<HI>l.</HI> and tho&s;e of the navy to 180,000<HI>l.</HI> The national debt, in 1771, was 3,418,000<HI>l.</HI> the intere&s;t of which was di&s;|charged by an annual payment of 131,392<HI>l.</HI> which mu&s;t be added to the yearly expenditure. This revenue com|pared to that of England is very &s;mall, but in Denmark, where every commodity is very cheap, it is an immen&s;e &s;um. The army, if &s;ub&s;idies be reckoned, as the King finds only arms, to va&s;t numbers, co&s;ts little or nothing; and the navy is maintained at a very ea&s;y rate. The num|ber on con&s;tant pay, during peace, is not large; and the re&s;t are retained by a month's pay in the year, to be ready at call; &s;o that the expence of the navy is little more than the building of &s;hips, and providing of &s;tores.</P>
<P>The army is compo&s;ed of the troops of Denmark and Hol&s;tein, and tho&s;e of Norway. Tho&s;e of the two former amount to 67,000 hor&s;e and foot; tho&s;e of the latter to 31,000; in the whole, 98,000.</P>

long, and at one part, at Darien, &s;o very narrow, as to make the communication between the two oceans, ea&s;t and we&s;t, by no means difficult.</P>
<P>America, in general, is not a mountainous country, yet, has the greate&s;t mountains in the world, and is better watered. In North America, part of which we are now going to treat of, the great river Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, ri&s;ing from unknown &s;ources, runs an immen&s;e cour&s;e, from north to &s;outh, and receives the va&s;t influx of the Ohio and Ouabache, and other immen&s;e rivers, &s;carcely in|ferior to the Rhine or the Danube, navigable almo&s;t to their very &s;ources, and laying open the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of this continent. Near the heads of the&s;e, are five va&s;t lakes, or rather &s;eas of fre&s;h water running into each other, and all communicating with the ocean, by the river St. Laurence, which pa&s;&s;es through them. The ea&s;tern &s;ide of North America, be&s;ides the noble rivers Hud&s;on, Delaware, Su&s;quehanna, Patowmack, &s;up|plies &s;everal others of great depth, length, and commo|dious navigation. Many parts of the &s;ettlements are &s;o inter&s;ected with navigable rivers and creeks, that the planters may be &s;aid, without exaggeration, to have each a harbour at his own door.</P>
<P>The Labrador coa&s;t, which is the country of the E&s;kimaux Indians, and lies near the north pole, we have treated of in the fir&s;t volume of this work; that which we are now going to de&s;cribe, belongs to the
<PB N="118" REF="126">
Engli&s;h, having been originally &s;ettled by the French, but by them ceded to us.</P>
<P>The aborigines of America, throughout the whole extent of the two va&s;t continents, which they inhabit, and among&s;t the infinite number of nations and tribes, into which they are divided, differ very little from each other in their manners and cu&s;toms; and they all form a very &s;triking picture of the mo&s;t di&s;tant antiquity.</P>
<P>When the Europeans fir&s;t came among them, they found the people quite naked, except tho&s;e parts which is common for the mo&s;t uncultivated people to conceal. Since that time, they have generally a coar&s;e blanket to cover them, which they buy from us. The whole fa&s;hion of their lives is of a piece, hardy, poor, and &s;quallid. Their only occupation is hunting. Agri|culture is left to the women. Merchandize they con|temn; but as I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to de&s;cribe them more particularly, I will not anticipate what I &s;hall be obliged to repeat.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t land on the approach to Canada, in the great Atlantic ocean, is the i&s;land of Newfoundland, be|longing to the Engli&s;h, &s;ituated between 47 and 52 de|grees north latitude. This i&s;land is of a triangular form, about 350 miles long from north to &s;outh, and about 200 miles broad at the ba&s;e, or broade&s;t part from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and is about 7 leagues di&s;tant from the continent.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="127">Notwith&s;tanding it lies more to the &s;outhward than England, the winters are much colder, and the earth is covered with &s;now, every year, for four or five months; &s;o that it is &s;carce habitable when the &s;un is in the &s;outh|ern &s;igns. This mu&s;t be owing to its vicinity to a va&s;t, frozen continent, over which the north-we&s;t wind blow|ing for many hundred miles, makes the countries that lie on that &s;ide of the Atlantic, much colder than tho&s;e on this &s;ide, in the &s;ame latitudes. At mid&s;ummer, how|ever, it is much hotter there than with us. The &s;ea|&s;ons, however, after all, are very temperate, neither are there any great extremities of heat and cold. It is a healthy place, and agrees very well with Engli&s;h con&s;ti|tutions. The &s;oil is exceedingly fruitful, and, without any art or cultivation, produces plants, fruits, and grain, fit for man and bea&s;t. Bilberries, barberries, ra&s;pberries, cherries, goo&s;eberries, &s;trawberries, white and red, pears, filberds, &amp;c. grow in &s;uch plenty, that a man may &s;ooner tire him&s;elf with eating, than &s;earching for them. Wheat, bailey, rye, pea&s;e, and vetches, were found in the country, when it was fir&s;t di&s;covered. In &s;hort, there is &s;carce any fruit, root, pul&s;e, or plant, that will flouri&s;h in England, that will not thrive here. The highlands are clothed with woods that pre&s;erve their ver|dure all the winter, and the plains are watered with ponds, brooks, and rivers, which refre&s;h the meadows, and make the gra&s;s high and rank.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="128">The animals of the i&s;land are buffaloes, deer, hares, foxes, &s;quirrels, wolves, bears, amphibious beavers, and others. Of &s;mall birds, and wild fowl, they have the &s;ame as with us, with the addition of the penguin: and their harbours and rivers are well &s;tocked with a variety of fi&s;h. All the world knows the reputa|tion of Newfoundland for cod; but the great rarity of all animals, is the mermaid; which, if we believe the word of Captain <HI>Whitburn,</HI> who wrote an account of this i&s;land, in the la&s;t century, is an inhabitant of the&s;e &s;eas. He affirms that as he was &s;tanding one day, early in the morning, at St. John's harbour, he &s;aw a creature making very &s;wiftly towards him, which by the eyes, no&s;e, chin, ears, neck, forehead, and in a word, by all the upper parts, which were very well proportioned, ap|peared to be a woman. The hair, indeed, was to be excepted; for in&s;tead of that, there were, all round about, upon the head, as it were, blue &s;treaks, which much re&s;embled hair, and hung down to the neck. The captain &s;ays, he looked at it &s;tedfa&s;tly, and &s;o did another of his company, that &s;tood not far from him, and &s;taid till it came within the length of a long pike from him, and then he retreated. When the creature &s;aw him withdrawing, it turned about al&s;o, and made away, which gave him an opportunity of viewing the &s;houlders and back parts of it, down to the wai&s;t. From the middle, to the lower part, (to u&s;e his own words) it went pointing, in proportion like a broad-hooked arrow; but how it was in the fore-part of the body,
<PB N="121" REF="129">
from the neck and &s;houlders downwards, he could not di&s;cern, becau&s;e it did not advance towards him, &s;o much above the water, as it appeared when it went away. This Syren had a mind to the Captain's company in &s;ome palace or other, within the dominions of Neptune, but he (though otherwi&s;e of good breeding) refu&s;ed the favour, and &s;lighted her, knowing there was no good wine in that country, but a guzzling of &s;alt-water, which kind of drinking-bout would have co&s;t him his life, and deprived him of chri&s;tian burial. She had &s;hewn him the charms of her face, but thought him unworthy of tho&s;e of her voice, which the poets of old have &s;o wonderfully extolled. But to be &s;erious, this &s;ame creature came &s;wiftly to the &s;ide of a boat, in which were &s;ome of the Captain's men, and endeavoured to get into it. The fellows were &s;cared at the &s;ight, and ready to leap out of the boat, when they perceived it attempting to get in. One of them, however, recovered &s;pirit enough to manage his oar, with which he &s;truck the Syren &s;uch a blow acro&s;s the head, as to make her let go her hold, and drop into the water. This did not kill her, for &s;he came up afterwards to &s;ome boats in the harbour, which, being near the &s;hore, the men got out and ran away. As a man could have no intere&s;t in forming this &s;tory, it may be credited as well as many other wonderful accounts of &s;trange mon&s;ters in the world.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="130">Whether there were any original natives of this i&s;land, we cannot take upon us to &s;ay; when it was fir&s;t di&s;covered, the Engli&s;h &s;aw &s;ome people on &s;hore, painted with oker, and cloathed with &s;tag-&s;kins (formed into a &s;ort of gowns) that reached to half way the leg, the &s;leeves coming down half way the arm, and beaver-&s;kins about their neck. They were bare-legged, and mo&s;t of them bare-footed. Their heads were uncovered. They wore their hair pretty long, a great lock behind, plaited with feathers, with a feather in it, &s;tanding upright, on the crown of the head, and a &s;mall lock plaited before. Their hair was of different colours; and their cloaths, as well as their bodies, were painted red.</P>
<P>Whether the&s;e were natives of the i&s;land, or wanderers from other parts, is unknown; but, at pre&s;ent, there do not &s;eem to be any ancient inhabitants. The i&s;land is over-run by the E&s;kimaux Indians, of whom we have treated; and as to Europeans, there do not remain, in the winter, above 1000 families, in the towns of Pla|centia, Bonavi&s;ta, and St. John.</P>
<P>The &s;mall i&s;lands of St. Pierre and Miquelon, &s;ituated to the &s;outhward of Newfoundland, in the year 1763, when the i&s;land was ceded to us, were re&s;erved to France, on condition they &s;hould erect no fortifications there, nor keep more than 50 &s;oldiers to inforce the police. By this treaty, they are at liberty to fi&s;h in the Gulph of St. Lawrence; but not within three leagues of any of

the coa&s;ts belonging to England, and are permitted to dry their nets on the northern more of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>The great bank of Newfoundland, &s;o renowned for its cod-fi&s;hery, is a &s;hoal, or properly a great mountain, hid under water, about 20 leagues from &s;hore, extend|ing 150 leagues from north to &s;outh, beginning in 41 degrees north latitude. Its great width, from ea&s;t to we&s;t, is about 90 leagues. The anchorage here is from 25 to 60 fathoms.</P>
<P>Great-Britain and North America, at the lowe&s;t com|putation, employ annually 3,000 &s;ail of &s;mall ve&s;&s;els in this fi&s;hery, on board of which, and on &s;hore, to cure and pack the fi&s;h, are upwards of 10,000 people, and it is an excellent nur&s;ery for &s;eamen. The cod we &s;ell abroad from this fi&s;hery, yields full, to us, 300,000<HI>l.</HI> a year.</P>
<P>Every thing in the cod, while fre&s;h, is good; but the be&s;t parts of it, <HI>viz.</HI> the head, the tongue, the liver, as it takes more &s;alt to pre&s;erve the&s;e, than they would be worth &s;alted, are thrown away. The large&s;t cod, &s;ays <HI>Charlevoix,</HI> I ever &s;aw on the bank, was not three feet long. It is a very voracious fi&s;h, and we often found in their &s;tomachs pieces of broken pots, and bits of iron and gla&s;s. The cod can turn it&s;elf in&s;ide out, like a pocket, and it is thus that it frees it&s;elf of any thing that troubles it. This fi&s;hing &s;ea&s;on is from the beginning of May, to the end of Augu&s;t.</P>

Sometimes two &s;word-fi&s;hes join again&s;t a whale, and then it is not an equal match. The whale has no weapon but its tail, which to make u&s;e of, it plunges its head under water, and if it can &s;trike its enemy with a blow of its tail, it is &s;ure to kill it; but the &s;word-fi&s;h is dexterous enough to &s;hun it, in&s;tantly falls on the whale, and runs its weapon into its back; but as it &s;eldom reaches the fat, it does not materially hurt the whale. When the whale &s;ees the &s;word-fi&s;h dart, it plunges, but the &s;word-fi&s;h pur&s;ues, and obliges it to appear again. Then the fight begins again, and continues till the &s;word-fi&s;h lo&s;es &s;ight of the whale, which fights always retreating, and &s;wims be&s;t on the &s;urface of the water.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="133">Cape Breton is an i&s;land, about 120 miles long, and 50 broad, a barren, de&s;art land, affording &s;carce any trees or herbage; lying between Newfoundland and Nova Scotia; the chief town of which is Loui&s;burgh. It has been taken and retaken by the French and Engli&s;h more than once; is at pre&s;ent in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h, but the town of Loui&s;burgh, which was once well for|tified by the French, is now di&s;mantled.</P>
<P>The i&s;land of St. John, in the Gulph of St. Lawrence, is al&s;o an Engli&s;h i&s;land, 60 miles long, and between 30 and 40 broad, with many fine rivers. On the reduction of Cape Breton, in 1758, the inhabitants, in number about 4,000, &s;ubmitted to the Briti&s;h arms, It is a plea&s;ant, fertile place, and &s;ettled by Engli&s;h families; many tracks of land being given to the Engli&s;h officers, at the peace of 1763.</P>
<P>The Gulph of St. Lawrence is 80 leagues long, in which, about half-way up, are two rocks, ri&s;ing about 60 feet per|pendicular above the &s;ea; the large&s;t of which is not above two or three hundred paces in circumference. They &s;tand clo&s;e to each other, and what is remarkable their &s;urface and &s;ides are &s;o covered with the dung of birds, that we cannot &s;ee their colour. They have been often vi&s;ited, and boats have been there loaded with birds eggs. The &s;tench of the&s;e rocks is almo&s;t in&s;upportable, and it is wonder|ful that, in &s;uch a multitude of ne&s;ts, every bird imme|diately finds its own. On firing a gun, this flying com|monwealth
<PB N="126" REF="134">
is alarmed, and there is formed, above the two i&s;lands, a thick cloud of the&s;e birds, two or three leagues round.</P>
<P>The gulph, or river, at the entrance, is 30 leagues wide, and adjoining, is the Bay of Ga&s;pe, in which is a natural curio&s;ity, viz. a &s;teep rock, 30 fathoms long, 10 high, and 4 broad, called the Pierced I&s;land, which looks like an old wall, and has in the mid&s;t of it an opening like an arch, through which a boat with its &s;ails up may pa&s;s; and not far from the i&s;land of Mi&s;cou is another curious production of nature in this gulph. There ri&s;es out of the &s;ea a &s;pring of fre&s;h water, which makes a jet above the &s;ea-water pretty high, like a fountain.</P>
<P>In the gulph of St. Lawrence are &s;ome good har|bours, and &s;ome few i&s;lands, one of which, Antico&s;to, is 40 leagues long, but very barren, and without a har|bour. As &s;oon as this i&s;land is pa&s;&s;ed, the River St. Lawrence narrows, &s;o that land may be &s;een on both &s;ides. One hundred and ten leagues from the &s;ea, the water, as at Woolwich, on the Thames, is a little bracki&s;h; and, at the entrance of the two canals, that form the i&s;land of Orleans, a little below Quebec, which &s;tands on this river, and where it is about one mile acro&s;s; I &s;ay, at the entrance of the two canals there is a phe|nomenon pretty difficult to explain, e&s;pecially if we con|&s;ider its great rapidity, notwith&s;tanding its breadth. The tide flows here regularly five hours, and ebbs &s;even; at Ta|dou&s;&s;ac,
<PB N="127" REF="135">
below this, it ebbs and flows &s;ix hours; and the higher we go up the river, the more the flood di|mini&s;hes, and the ebb increa&s;es, till we come 20 leagues above Quebec, when it flows three hours, and ebbs nine. When it is half flood in the port of Tadou&s;&s;ac, it is but ju&s;t beginning to flow at Checoutimi, 25 leagues higher up the river Saguenay, at the mouth of which Tadou&s;&s;ac &s;tands, and yet it is high water at the three places at the &s;ame time. This happens, no doubt, becau&s;e the ra|pidity of the river Saguenay, greater than that of St. Lawrence, running again&s;t the tide, makes an equilibrium, for &s;ome time, between Checoutimi and the entrance of the Saguenay into the great river St. Lawrence.</P>
<P>The river up to the i&s;le of Orleans, 112 leagues from the &s;ea, is never le&s;s than four or five leagues wide, but above the i&s;land it grows narrower all at once, &s;o that at Quebec it is only a mile broad. Quebec, in the language of the country, means <HI>&s;hut up.</HI> The fir&s;t thing that ap|pears, on entering the road of Quebec, is a fine &s;heet of water, 30 feet wide, and 40 high, called the Fall of Montmorenci. It is directly at the entrance of the little channel of the i&s;le of Orleans. Every one would judge, that &s;uch a large fall of water, which runs continually, was the di&s;charge of &s;ome fine river, but it is only de|rived from an incon&s;iderable current, from a lake which, in &s;ome places, is not ancle deep.</P>
<P>Quebec is a league higher, in the very place where the river is narrowe&s;t. The moorings are over-again&s;t

the city, where there is 25 fathom water, and good an|chorage. When it was founded in 1608, the tide ro&s;e to the foot of the rock, but &s;ince that time the river has re|tired by degrees, and left a great &s;pace dry, where they have built the lower city, but high enough above the &s;hore to be &s;ecure from inundations. The upper city &s;tands upon a rock of marble and &s;late. On landing, we enter a pretty long &s;treet, which takes up the whole breadth of the place, and leads to the upper city; and the way is &s;o &s;teep, that we ri&s;e by &s;teps, and of cour&s;e can only go on foot. This &s;treet is bordered with &s;tone hou&s;e pretty well built, with their backs clo&s;e to the rock, &s;o that they have but little depth. In the upper city is a place of arms before the fort, which is a regu|lar and beautiful citadel, covering the whole town, and where the governor re&s;ides. It is not a large place, though the capital of Canada, containing about &s;even or eight thou&s;and inhabitants. Ships of the greate&s;t burden load and unload here, and many are here built.</P>
<P>This city is a bi&s;hopric, but the cathedral is mean, &s;erving as a pari&s;h-church to all the place. It has a &s;mall church be&s;ides in the lower city. The bi&s;hop's pa|lace is a long &s;quare, and makes a good appearance; the gardens extend to the brow of the rock, and command all the road. Here is a college of Je&s;uits, two convents, two ho&s;pitals, but the greate&s;t beauty of the place is its &s;ociety. There &s;eems to be every thing for all &s;orts of people to pa&s;s their time very agreeably, and they do

They play, they make parties of plea&s;ure in &s;ummer in chariots or canoes; in winter, in &s;ledges on the &s;now, or &s;kaiting on the ice. The news current is but little, becau&s;e the country furni&s;hes &s;carce any; and the news from Europe comes generally alto|gether. There is nobody rich here, for they &s;pend their money as freely as they get it, on their tables and their dre&s;s.</P>
<P>Twenty-five leagues higher up the river St. Law|rence, is the town of Three Rivers, where the river is half a league wide; it is but a &s;mall place, but prettily &s;ituated, having &s;ome good iron mines in its neighbour|hood. There is a convent of Recollets, a fine ho&s;pital, and a nunnery of Ur&s;ulines. It is fortified, and has a good garri&s;on.</P>
<P>From Three Rivers to Montreal, through the countries of the Irroquois Indians, the river St. Law|rence is full of i&s;lands. On the &s;ide of Quebec the land is good, but for a long winter, univer&s;ally covered with &s;now. Thirty leagues above Three Rivers is the i&s;le of Montreal, in the &s;ame river St. Lawrence, an i&s;land ten leagues long from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and near four broad. There is a mountain in this i&s;land, with two heads of unequal height, almo&s;t in the middle, but the town is built only half a league from the &s;outh coa&s;t. It has a very chearful a&s;pect, is well &s;ituated, open, and well built. The agreeablene&s;s of its environs, and its pro&s;|pects,
<PB N="130" REF="139">
in&s;pire a certain gaiety, of which every one feels the effect. Montreal is a long &s;quare, &s;ituated on the bank of the river, which, ri&s;ing in&s;en&s;ibly, divides the town in its length into high and low; but the a&s;cent from one to the other is &s;carcely perceivable. The &s;treets are regular, and well cut. It contains three con|vents, with hand&s;ome churches, and an ho&s;pital for the &s;ick. The fortifications are good, and the inhabitants are &s;aid to be about 5,000. As the town ri&s;es from the river, every hou&s;e, (and all are hand&s;ome), may be &s;een at one view from the harbour. The river here is only navigable by canoes, or &s;mall craft, having &s;everal falls between this and Quebec. Yet the Indian fair, and their trade the whole year, make it no incon|&s;iderable place. The <HI>Hotel Dieu,</HI> and the King's maga|zines, are in the lower town, and almo&s;t all the traders live there: the convents and the pari&s;h-church are &s;itu|ated in the upper town, and the governor and the greate&s;t part of the officers there re&s;ide. The pari&s;h-church has more the appearance of a cathedral than that at Quebec, and the &s;ervice is performed with a mode&s;ty and dignity which in&s;pires re&s;pect for the maje&s;ty of God, who is here adored.</P>
<P>Between the i&s;land of Montreal and the continent, on the north &s;ide, there is another i&s;land, about eight leagues long and two leagues over. The channel, which &s;epa|rates the two i&s;lands, runs through the mid&s;t of fine meadows, but its cour&s;e is impeded towards the middle
<PB N="131" REF="140">
by a torrent or water-fall. The third arm of the river is &s;trewed, as it were, with &s;uch a number of &s;mall i&s;lands, that there is almo&s;t as much land as water.</P>
<P>From Quebec to Montreal, which is about 170 miles di&s;tance, the country on both &s;ides the river is very well &s;ettled, and has an agreeable effect upon the eye; the farms lie pretty clo&s;e all the way; &s;everal gentlemen's hou&s;es, neatly built, &s;hew them&s;elves at intervals, and there is all the appearance of a flouri&s;hing colony; but there are no towns or villages, but that of Three Rivers which I have mentioned.</P>
<P>With all the attention of the Court of France to the trade and peopling of this colony, they have not been able thoroughly to overcome the con&s;equences of tho&s;e difficulties which the climate, whil&s;t the place was un|&s;ettled, threw in their way. Their lo&s;&s;es in the wars with the brave and fierce Irroquois Indians, and the bad navi|gation of the river St. Lawrence, which is an incurable evil, have kept back the colony; therefore, though it is the olde&s;t of all the French e&s;tabli&s;hments, and prior to our &s;ettling of New England, the inhabitants are not above 100,000 in number.</P>
<P>That which has been the &s;ecurity of Montreal, and its environs, are two villages of Irroquois chri&s;tians, and the fort of Chambly. The fir&s;t is that of the fall of St. Louis, &s;ituated on the continent, on the &s;outh &s;ide
<PB N="132" REF="141">
of the river, three leagues above Montreal, which is very populous, and has always been e&s;teemed one of the &s;tronge&s;t barriers again&s;t the heathen Irroquois, and the people of New-York. It has a good church. The &s;ituation is charming; and the river St. Lawrence, which is very wide here, and full of i&s;lands, has a fine effect. The &s;econd village is that of the Mountain, over-again&s;t the we&s;t end of the i&s;land of Montreal. The&s;e two villages have produced many brave men, and their fer|vor in religion was wonderful, before the avarice of traders had introduced brandy among them, which has occa|&s;ioned &s;uch di&s;orders, that in the &s;quares and &s;treets of Montreal is often &s;een the mo&s;t frightful &s;pectacles, the certain con&s;equence of the drunkenne&s;s of the&s;e barba|rians: hu&s;bands and wives; fathers, mothers, and their children; brothers and &s;i&s;ters, taking each other by the throat, tearing each others ears, and biting one another, like furious wolves. The air often re&s;ounds in the night with howlings, more horrible than tho&s;e which the wild bea&s;ts make in the woods.</P>
<P>The great trade for &s;kins is carried on at Montreal, by the &s;avages of the north and we&s;t, re&s;orting here at certain &s;ea&s;ons, from all parts of Canada, to the di&s;tance of 1,000 miles. Little fleets of Indians are &s;een on the river in the month of June, when this &s;air begins, and continues for three months. On this occa&s;ion, many &s;olemnities are ob&s;erved; guards are placed, and the governor a&s;&s;i&s;ts to pre&s;erve order.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="142">Fort Chambly is &s;ituated about 17 leagues up the river Richlieu, which empties it&s;elf into the river St. Lawrence, near the town of Three Rivers. It is built with &s;tone, flanked with four ba&s;tions, and has a pretty good garri&s;on; it is eight leagues from Lake Champ|lain, at the extremity of which &s;tands Crown-Point.</P>
<P>Having now de&s;cribed the principal &s;ettlements on the river St. Lawrence, I will &s;peak of Canada more generally.</P>
<P>Canada, as ceded by France to England, and now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by us, was commonly called New France. It had no bounds to the north, but, on the &s;ide of Hud&s;on's Bay; and no other on the ea&s;t but the &s;ea: the Engli&s;h Colonies, now the united &s;tates of America, on the &s;outh, Loui&s;iana to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, and the Spani&s;h territories to the we&s;t. In this great extent of country, there are but three mother-tongues, from which all others are derived. The&s;e are the <HI>Sioux,</HI> the <HI>Algonguin,</HI> and the <HI>Huron.</HI> We know but little of the people that &s;peak the fir&s;t of the&s;e languages, and no one knows how far it extends. The <HI>Sioux</HI> were a peace|able people, before the <HI>Hurons</HI> and <HI>Outaouais</HI> took re|fuge in the country, from the fury of die <HI>Irroquois.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Sioux</HI> have a plurality of wives, and &s;everely puni&s;h tho&s;e who fail in conjugal fidelity; by cutting off the end of their no&s;es, and cutting a circle in a part of the
<PB N="134" REF="143">
&s;kin, on the top of their heads, and pulling it off; that is, &s;calping them. Some of the&s;e people are &s;aid to have a Chine&s;e accent. They dwell commonly in meadows, under tents, made of &s;kins, and well wrought, living on wild oats, which grow abundantly in their mar&s;hes, and by hunting, e&s;pecially the buffaloes that are covered with wool, and which are &s;een in herds of thou&s;ands each, in their meadows. They have no fixed abode, but travel in great companies, like the Tartars, and never &s;tay longer in one place, than the chace detains them.</P>
<P>In Canada, there are five fre&s;h-water lakes, the &s;malle&s;t of which is larger than any known lake in the world. This is Lake Ontario, which is not le&s;s than 200 leagues round. O&s;wego is longer, but not &s;o broad; Huron &s;preads greatly in width; Michegan is longer one way than the other; but Lake Superior is 500 leagues round, and contains &s;everal large i&s;lands. They are all navigable by any &s;ized ve&s;&s;els, and all communi|cate with one another, except that the pa&s;&s;age between O&s;wego and Ontario is interrupted by a &s;tupendous cata|ract, called the Falls of Niagara, forming the river of that name, or rather the river of St. Lawrence, which comes out of Lake O&s;wego or Erie, and pa&s;&s;es through Lake Ontario, after a &s;treight of 14 leagues. They call it the river of Niagarra from the fall, and this &s;pace is about &s;ix leagues. At the entrance of this river is a fort, where it is de&s;igned to erect a village.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="144">To reach the height from whence this river falls, we mu&s;t pa&s;s over three mountains, one above ano|ther. The country of Niagara is frightful and &s;avage. On one &s;ide we &s;ee, under our feet, and as it were in the bottom of an aby&s;s, a great river indeed; but which, in this place, re&s;embles more a torrent by its rapidity, by the whirlpools which a thou&s;and rocks make in it, through which it has much difficulty to find a pa&s;|&s;age, and by the foam with which it is always covered. On the other &s;ide, the view is covered by the three mountains I have mentioned, ri&s;ing one above another, the la&s;t of which lo&s;es it&s;elf in the clouds, and where the poets might well have &s;aid, the Titans would have &s;caled heaven. In &s;hort, turn which way we will, we di&s;cover &s;cenes that in&s;pire horror. But travel a little further; go beyond the&s;e wild and inho&s;pitable mountains, and we &s;ee a rich &s;oil, magnificent fore&s;ts, plea&s;ant and fruitful hills; and we breathe a pure air, and enjoy a temperate climate, between the two lakes O&s;wego and Ontario.</P>
<P>This waterfall is about half a mile wide, in the form of a hor&s;e-&s;hoe; but it is divided, exactly in the middle, by a very narrow i&s;land, about half a mile long, which comes to a point here; but the&s;e two parts of the river unite again, before it reaches the rock that almo&s;t cro&s;&s;es it, and near the precipice, from which it tumbles per|pendicularly, in its whole breadth 150 feet. No words can expre&s;s the con&s;ternation of travellers at &s;eeing &s;o great a body of water falling, or rather violently thrown
<PB N="136" REF="145">
from &s;o great a height, upon the rocks below; from which it rebounds again to a very great height, white as &s;now, being by the&s;e violent agitations converted into foam. The noi&s;e of this cataract is often heard at the di&s;tance of 15 miles, and the vapour ari&s;ing from it may &s;ometimes be &s;een at a great di&s;tance, in appearance like a cloud, or pillar of &s;moke, or in form of a rainbow, when the &s;un &s;hines on it. Many bea&s;ts and water-fowl, in attempting to &s;wim acro&s;s the &s;tream, above the fall, have been found da&s;hed to pieces below, and &s;ome|times the Indians, through drunkenne&s;s, or carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, have &s;hared the &s;ame fate.</P>
<P><HI>Charlevoix,</HI> who travelled round the Lake Erie, or O&s;wego, in the month of June, gives the following de|&s;cription of his tour. "If one travelled, as I did then, with a clear &s;ky, and a charming climate, by a water, as bright as the fine&s;t fountain, meeting every where with a &s;afe and plea&s;ing place to encamp in; where one might find all manner of game, at little co&s;t, breathing at one's ea&s;e, a pure air, and enjoying the &s;ight of the fine&s;t countries, one would be tempted to travel all one's life. It put me in mind of tho&s;e antient patriarchs, who had no fixed abode, dwelt under tents, were in &s;ome manner ma&s;ters of all the countries they travelled over, without the trouble of attendants, or the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a great domain. How many oaks repre&s;ented to me that of Mamre? How many fountains reminded me of that of Jacob? Every day a new &s;ituation of my own chu&s;ing,
<PB N="137" REF="146">
a neat and convenient hou&s;e, &s;et up, and furni&s;hed with nece&s;&s;aries in a quarter of an hour, &s;pread with flowers, always fre&s;h, covered with a fine green carpet; and on every &s;ide plain and natural beauties, which art had not altered, and which it cannot imitate. If the&s;e plea&s;ures &s;uffer &s;ome interruption, either by bad weather, or &s;ome unfore&s;een accident, they are the more reli&s;hed when they re-appear.</P>
<P>They &s;ay this is the fine&s;t part of Canada; and, in|deed, to judge of it by appearances, nature has denied it nothing, that can render a country beautiful: hills, meadows, fields, fine woods of timber-trees, brooks, fountains, and rivers, and all the&s;e of &s;uch a good qua|lity, and &s;o happily intermixed, that one could &s;carce wi&s;h for any thing more. The lands are not good for all &s;orts of grain, but the greate&s;t part are &s;urpri&s;ingly fertile, &s;ome will produce wheat eight years in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, with|out manure. The i&s;les here &s;eem to have been placed on purpo&s;e to captivate the eye. The rivers and the lakes are full of fi&s;h, and the climate temperate, and very healthy.</P>
<P>But, on the other hand, if the weather is &s;o delightful in &s;ummer, it is the rever&s;e in winter, which begins in a manner that a&s;toni&s;hes tho&s;e who are not u&s;ed to it. The fir&s;t fro&s;t fills the river St. Lawrence with ice in a few days, and the earth is &s;oon covered with &s;now which
<PB N="138" REF="147">
continues &s;ix months, and always to the depth of &s;ix feet where the wind has little power.</P>
<P>There is, indeed, no want of wood to provide again&s;t the cold, which &s;oon becomes exce&s;&s;ive, and la&s;ts till the &s;pring is pretty forward; but it is very melancholy, not to be able to &s;tir out, without being frozen, or without being wrapt up in furs, like a bear. Be&s;ides, what a &s;ight is the &s;now, which dazzles the eyes, and conceals all the beauties of nature! There is no longer any dif|ference between the rivers and the fields; no more va|riety; even the trees are covered with rime, and all their branches hung with icicles, under which it is not &s;afe to pa&s;s. What can one think, when we &s;ee hou&s;es with beards of ice a foot long? And how can one travel in a country where bears for &s;ix months dare not venture from their holes? Seldom is there a winter, but per&s;ons are carried to the ho&s;pitals, to have their legs and arms cut off, that are frozen, pa&s;t recovery. In &s;hort, if the &s;ky is clear, there blows from the we&s;tern parts a wind that cuts the face. If, indeed, the wind changes to &s;outh or ea&s;t, the weather grows a little milder, but there falls &s;uch a thick &s;now, that we cannot &s;ee ten paces before us at noon day. If a thawing air comes, adieu to all the capons, quarters of beef and mutton, the fowls and fi&s;h that had been laid up frozen in the &s;tore-rooms; &s;o that in &s;pite of the rigour of the exce&s;&s;ive cold, the inha|bitants are &s;till obliged to wi&s;h for its continuance. But as &s;oon as the month of May arrives, the &s;cene is changed,
<PB N="139" REF="148">
and the &s;weetne&s;s of the &s;ea&s;on is the more plea&s;ing, as it &s;ucceeds a rigorous one. The heat of the &s;ummer, in le&s;s than four months time, &s;hews both &s;eed-time and harve&s;t, and the &s;erenity of autumn gives a cour&s;e of finer days than is &s;een in Europe. Lands are here plowed in &s;ummer, &s;own from the mid&s;t of April to the 10th of May, and the corn is cut from the 15th of Augu&s;t to the 20th of September.</P>
<P>At York Fort, a &s;ettlement belonging to the Hud&s;on's Bay Company, which lies in north latitude; 57 degrees, and 93 degrees we&s;t longitude, from London, the air, though inten&s;ely cold, is very &s;alubrious and healthy, e&s;pecially in the winter-months; and in the &s;ummer, though it is much hotter than in England, yet Euro|peans enjoy a good &s;hare of health. The atmo&s;phere is cleare&s;t, and mo&s;t &s;erene, in the colde&s;t weather, and the mo&s;t piercing cold is felt at &s;un-ri&s;ing. In January, Fahrenheit's thermometer is frequently 50 degrees be|low 0, and in &s;ummer, the mercury will often ri&s;e to 90 degrees above 0, making a difference of 140 degrees, between the extremities of heat and cold. From No|vember to the vernal equinox, rum and brandy will freeze to the con&s;i&s;tence of honey, and a ca&s;k of water in the open air has bur&s;t in the cour&s;e of 48 hours. The fro&s;t is never out of the ground; even in &s;ummer, it is not thawed lower than about four feet below the &s;urface, and two feet in the woods. Notwith&s;tanding the natives take every precaution to guard again&s;t the
<PB N="140" REF="149">
con&s;equences of the cold, they frequently fall a prey to its &s;everity. After enduring great torment for a con|&s;iderable time, the cold at la&s;t &s;eizes the vital parts, and the unfortunate per&s;on &s;oon expires. Women have been found frozen to death, with a young infant likewi&s;e frozen, cla&s;ping its arms round the mother's neck; others have been found dead, and the babe &s;till alive.</P>
<P>In the colde&s;t weather, the atmo&s;phere is mo&s;t &s;erene. Throughout the day, the air is generally filled with icy particles, &s;mall beyond conception, which being driven by the wind, adhere to every thing in their way. In the evening, the &s;tars begin to &s;hine with refulgent lu&s;tre, and the contemplative mind is &s;truck with reve|rence and awe, and &s;ees the <HI>aurora borealis</HI> darting with inconceivable velocity to all parts of the heavens. Mock &s;uns often appear, which is a &s;ure indication of inten&s;e cold; and mock moons, when the vapours, ari&s;ing from open water, become conden&s;ed by the fro&s;t.</P>
<P>At Churchill Fort, another &s;ettlement of the Hud&s;on's Bay Company, and two degrees more to the northward, the cold is inten&s;ely &s;evere. From the end of October to the middle of May, this part of the world is buried in fro&s;t and &s;now; but yet, when the genial rays of the &s;un begin to extend to the&s;e parts of the globe, vegetation is exceedingly quick, and the produce of the garden, may be gathered in the middle of June. The &s;un ri&s;es in the &s;horte&s;t day, at York Fort, at 48 minutes after eight.
<PB N="141" REF="150">
The woods at Churchill Fort are con&s;iderably &s;maller than tho&s;e at York Fort; the&s;e are junipers, pines, pop|lars, and willows; and, indeed, they are &s;o in&s;ignificantly &s;mall as to make firing exceedingly &s;carce; and the fur|ther north the traveller goes, the barer he will find the earth of every vegetable; till at la&s;t, not the lea&s;t herb is to be &s;een, nor any trace of human &s;teps ob&s;erved in the frigid wa&s;te.</P>
<P>In the interior parts of the country in north latitude 55 degrees, and we&s;t longitude, from London, 120, where Mr. <HI>Umfreville</HI> pa&s;&s;ed four years, from 1784 to 1787, on the bank of a large river, which empties it&s;elf, by many branches, into Lake Bourbon, the climate is &s;omething milder than about Quebec. The fruits, which grow &s;pontaneou&s;ly, are here in greater variety than in the wilderne&s;&s;es of Canada. The natives collect a kind of wild cherries, and &s;ell them to the Hud&s;on's Bay people, who make a beverage of them. Ra&s;pberries, &s;trawberries, currants, and an infinity of other &s;orts, are to be found; &s;o that were a per&s;on bewildered here, and alone, without communication, he might, in the &s;um|mer-&s;ea&s;on, procure a very comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Every pond would furni&s;h him with duck and other eggs, and every thicket with a &s;atiety of delicious fruits.</P>
<P>In vallies, and moi&s;t &s;ituations, the gra&s;s grows to a great height. In winter, the &s;now is not half &s;o deep
<PB N="142" REF="151">
as near the &s;ea-coa&s;t, nor are the hotte&s;t days in &s;ummer near &s;o &s;ultry. The heavens, in cold, winter-nights, do not exhibit &s;o luminous an appearance as near the &s;ea; nor are the <HI>aurora borealis,</HI> mock-&s;uns, or mock-moons, near &s;o frequent. In &s;hort, the two countries will admit of no compari&s;on; the country here is tem|perate and healthy, the land is dry, plea&s;ant, and fertile, and the animal creation is various and excellent, for the &s;upport of man. A per&s;on might here pa&s;s his days with ea&s;e, content, and felicity; and if he did not enjoy an uninterrupted &s;tate of health, it would not be the fault of the air he lived in.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the lower country, approaching the &s;ea, is one endle&s;s bog, where wild animals are con|&s;tantly &s;wamped. The fine&s;t &s;ummer's day will begin with a &s;corching heat, and terminate with a cold ea&s;terly &s;ea-fog, that &s;hall ob&s;cure the &s;un for &s;everal weeks. The whole country furni&s;hes but one &s;pecies of quadru|peds, the buffalo, fit for the &s;upport of man, and the Europeans are accur&s;ed with an afflicting, epidemical di&s;|order, which they very emphatically term, "The country di&s;temper." This is a violent pain in the brea&s;t, &s;uppo&s;ed to proceed from the cold air being drawn into the lungs, which, impeding the ve&s;&s;els from &s;preading throughout that organ, hinders the circulation, and renders re&s;piration extremely painful and difficult; though no one dies of it. The venereal di&s;ea&s;e is al&s;o
<PB N="143" REF="152">
common among them; but the &s;ymptoms are much milder than in Europe.</P>
<P>This &s;everity of cold in a more &s;outhern latitude than our own, can be only attributed to its vicinage to the north &s;eas, that are covered with mon&s;trous heaps of ice, above eight months in the year, and to the winds com|ing acro&s;s va&s;t countries, and a great chain of moun|tains, always covered with &s;now.</P>
<P>There is another province belonging to us, lying ea&s;t of the river St. Lawrence, and bounded by the Atlantic ocean, this is Nova Scotia, called by the French Arcadia. It has New England and the ocean to the &s;outh and we&s;t of the river St. Lawrence, and its gulph to the north and north-ea&s;t, and lies between the 44th and 50th degrees of north latitude, and though in a favourable part of the temperate zone, has a very &s;evere winter of &s;even months, &s;ucceeded by a &s;hort &s;ummer violently &s;corching, with|out any intervention of any thing that may be called &s;pring. For, long after the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on has com|menced, they are wrapt in the gloom of a perpetual fog. The whole country is almo&s;t a continued fore&s;t. The &s;oil is in general thin and barren, the corn it produces, of a &s;hrivelled kind, like rye, and the gra&s;s intermixed with a wild, &s;pungy mo&s;s. However, though it is uni|formly bad; there are tracts in Nova Scotia, which do not yield to the be&s;t land in New England.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="153">Unpromi&s;ing as this country is, the French &s;eated them&s;elves here, before they made any e&s;tabli&s;hment in Canada, and their colony increa&s;ed largely; whereas, at pre&s;ent, if the &s;upport of our government was with|drawn from our &s;ettlements there, notwith&s;tanding the immen&s;e &s;ums that have been expended in them, they would &s;ink into nothing. By the treaty of Utrecht, it became the property of the Engli&s;h, and in 1743, 3000 families were tran&s;ported there, at one time, at the expence of this country, and three regiments &s;ta|tioned to protect them from the Indians.</P>
<P>The chief town we had formerly in this province, was called Annapolis Royal, but, though the capital, it was a &s;mall place, wretchedly fortified, badly built, and as badly inhabited. Though Annapolis &s;tood on the be&s;t harbour, as it is &s;aid, in all North America, capable of containing 1000 ve&s;&s;els at &s;afe anchor, it never flouri&s;hed, which induced the new &s;ettlers to build the town of Halifax. This is commodiou&s;ly &s;ituated for the fi&s;hery, and &s;tands on a fine harbour. It has a good timber entrenchment, &s;trengthened with forts, &s;ufficient to guard it again&s;t an Indian enemy.</P>
<P>Halifax has a communication with mo&s;t parts of the province, either by land-carriage, the &s;ea, or navigable rivers, and in the harbour lies a &s;mall &s;quadron of &s;hips, which puts to &s;ea in &s;ummer, under a commodore, to protect the Newfoundland fi&s;hery. Was it not for this
<PB N="145" REF="154">
fi&s;hery, the inhabitants mu&s;t often &s;tarve, as all their provi&s;ion comes from New-England. Though the town, all things con&s;idered, has a tolerable appear|ance, the adjacent country is not proportionably im|proved. The ground is very hard to be cleared; when cleared, it is worth little, and labour is very dear. But it has &s;uffered mo&s;t from the incur&s;ions of the In|dians, which have been &s;o frequent, and attended with &s;uch cruelties, that the people can hardly extend them|&s;elves beyond the cannon of their fort, of cour&s;e do not rai&s;e a fifth part of what is &s;ufficient to maintain them. Though all the fighting men the Indians can rai&s;e in this province, do not amount to 500; yet the &s;oldiers, inac|tive by their confinement in barracks, di&s;ea&s;ed by &s;curvy, and weakened by drinking, are quite undermatched for the activity, vigilance, patience, and addre&s;s of the native Americans.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides Annapolis and Halifax, there is another &s;et|tlement, a little to the &s;outh-we&s;t of the latter, called Lunenburg, colonized by a branch of Germans from Halifax, in &s;earch of a better &s;oil. The&s;e &s;eem to &s;uc|ceed well.</P>
<P>But to return to the Aborigines of Canada. We have &s;poken of the Sioux. The A&s;&s;iniboils inhabit about a lake, which bears their name, and which is but little known. The common opinion is, that this lake is 600 leagues in circumference, and contains a number
<PB N="146" REF="155">
of i&s;lands, and that it cannot be approached but by ways almo&s;t impa&s;&s;able; that all the borders of it are charm|ing; that the air is very temperate; and that it lies to the north-we&s;t of Lake Superior, where the cold is ex|treme. Some of the &s;avages call it <HI>Michinipi,</HI> that is, The Great Water, and it &s;eems to be the &s;ource of the greate&s;t rivers, and all the great lakes of North America, for, by &s;everal evidences, they make the river Bour|bon, to ri&s;e from it, which falls into Hud&s;on's Bay; the river St. Lawrence, which carries its waters to the ocean; the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, which di&s;charges it&s;elf into the gulph of Mexico; the Me&s;&s;ouri, which joins with the la&s;t, and a fifth, which empties it&s;elf into the &s;outh-&s;ea. We cannot a&s;&s;ert the truth of it, but <HI>Charlevoix</HI> &s;ays, on the reports of &s;ome &s;avages, that there are, about the lake of the A&s;&s;iniboils, men like Europeans, and who are &s;ettled in a country, where &s;ilver and gold is in &s;uch plenty, that it &s;erves for the mo&s;t common u&s;es.</P>
<P>Father <HI>Marquette,</HI> who di&s;covered the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi in 1673, &s;ays, that &s;ome &s;avages not only &s;poke to him of the river, which, taking its ri&s;e from this lake, runs to the we&s;t; but, that they al&s;o added, they had &s;een great &s;hips in its mouth. It appears in the old maps, under the name of <HI>Poualaks,</HI> and &s;ome accounts &s;ay, that their country is the boundary to that of the <HI>Cri&s;tinaux.</HI> The&s;e A&s;&s;iniboils, are tall, well-made, &s;trong, active men, inured to cold, and fatigue, who prick their bodies all over with figures of &s;erpents, and
<PB N="147" REF="156">
other animals, and undertake very long journeys. They differ from the Cri&s;tinaux, their neighbours, ina&s;much as the latter have a great deal of vivacity, &s;peak with great volubility of tongue, and are always &s;inging and dancing; whereas the A&s;&s;iniboils are of very grave ca&s;t.</P>
<P>The Algonquin and Huron languages, have, between them, almo&s;t all the &s;avage nations of Canada that we are acquainted with. He who under&s;tands both, might travel, without an interpreter, 1500 leagues of country, and make him&s;elf under&s;tood by a hundred, different nations, who have each their peculiar tongue.</P>
<P>The Algonquins, or Cannibas, are neighbours to New-England; but, in going up the river St. Lawrence, we meet with no &s;avage nation, till we come to Saguenay, which is many leagues before we reach Quebec. Be|tween Quebec and Montreal, towards Three Rivers, are a few Algonquins, but they do not form a village. Fron Montreal northwards, are &s;ome few &s;avage nations. In the more interior parts there are many. The greater part of the Algonguin nations, except tho&s;e which are more advanced towards the &s;outh, employ them&s;elves but little in hu&s;bandry, and live almo&s;t wholly upon hunting and fi&s;hing, &s;o that they are not fixed to any place. Some of them allow plurality of wives; yet, far from multiplying, they decrea&s;e every day. There is
<PB N="148" REF="157">
not any one of the&s;e nations that con&s;i&s;ts of 6000 people, &s;ome not of 2000.</P>
<P>The Huron language is not by far &s;o exten&s;ive as the Algonquin: when I &s;ay the Huron language, I &s;peak in conformity to common opinion; for &s;ome maintain, that the Irroquois is the mother-tongue. Be this as it may, all the &s;avages to the &s;outh of the river St. Law|rence, from the river Sorel, to the end of the Lake Erie, and even pretty near Virginia, belong to this lan|guage, and he, who under&s;tands Huron, under&s;tands them all. The Cherokees are a pretty numerous peo|ple, who inhabit the va&s;t meadows between the Lake Erie, and the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi. To what language the&s;e belong, is not yet known; but, from a continual con|nexion among all the &s;avages, they can under&s;tand each other, without an interpreter.</P>
<P>The Huron language has a copiou&s;ne&s;s, an energy, and a &s;ublimity, perhaps not to be found united in any of the fine&s;t we know; and tho&s;e, who&s;e native tongue it is, though now but a handful of men, have an eleva|tion of &s;oul, that agrees better with the maje&s;ty of their language, than with the &s;ad &s;tate to which they are reduced. Some have fancied they found in it a &s;imi|litude with the Hebrew; others, and the greate&s;t num|ber, have maintained it had they &s;ame origin as the Greek, but nothing is more trifling than the proofs they bring of it.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="158">The Algonquin has not &s;o much force as the Huron, but has more &s;weetne&s;s and elegance. In the Huron all is conjugated. Both have a richne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion, a variety of turns, a propriety of terms, a regularity which a&s;toni&s;hes; and, what is more &s;upri&s;ing, among the&s;e barbarians, who never &s;tudy to &s;peak well, and who never had the u&s;e of writing, there is not intro|duced a bad word, an improper term, or a vicious con|&s;truction; and even children pre&s;erve all the purity of their language, in their common di&s;cour&s;e. On the other hand, the manner in which they animate all they &s;ay, leaves no doubt of their comprehending all the worth of their expre&s;&s;ions, and all the beauty of their language.</P>
<P>Exce&s;s of liquor frequently makes Europeans chearful and merry; but, with the Indian, it has a contrary effect. At this time, he brings his departed friends and relations to remembrance, pathetically laments their death with tears; and, if near their graves, will run and weep over them. Others will &s;ing in chorus, till they cannot hold up their heads, but will roll about their tents, as in a fit of phren&s;y, and frequently into the fire. On the&s;e occa&s;ions &s;ome quarrel is &s;ure to en&s;ue; but they have &s;en&s;e enough to order the women to put all dangerous weapons out of the way; yet, as they cannot remove their teeth, it is not uncommon to &s;ee &s;ome of them, the next morning, without a no&s;e: Sometimes they come off with the lo&s;s only of an ear, or the joint of a finger:
<PB N="150" REF="159">
and, in the&s;e affrays, no regard is paid to relation|&s;hip; brothers and &s;i&s;ters often fighting with each other. After one of the&s;e rencounters, &s;ays <HI>Umfreville,</HI> an Indian entered the fort, one morning, begging to &s;ee the &s;urgeon; and as &s;oon as he was admitted into his apartment, addre&s;&s;ed him in broken Engli&s;h, with, "Look here, man, here my no&s;e," holding out his hand, with half of his no&s;e in it, which he wanted the &s;urgeon to put on again. The man's nephew had bit it off, and he declared he felt no pain; nor was he &s;en&s;i|ble of his lo&s;s, till the next morning, when, awaking, he found the piece lying by his &s;ide.</P>
<P>The&s;e Indians, however, when &s;ober, are mild, af|fable, and good-natured, ready to relieve the wants of their di&s;tre&s;&s;ed brethren; but, on the other hand, are &s;ly, cunning, and artful, glorying in every &s;pecies of theft and artifice, e&s;pecially when the deception has been &s;o well executed as to e&s;cape detection.</P>
<P>The care which mothers take of their children, whil&s;t in the cradle, is beyond all expre&s;&s;ion, tends to their perfect form, and proves very clearly that we often &s;poil all, when we exceed the tenets which nature has taught us. They never leave them, but carry them every where with them, and when they &s;eem ready to &s;ink under the burdens they load them&s;elves with, the cradle of their child is reckoned as nothing. Their cradles are neat beyond mea&s;ure. The child lies very
<PB N="151" REF="160">
conveniently, and very ea&s;y in them, bound in them only as high as the wai&s;t, &s;o that when the cradle is upright, the&s;e little creatures have their heads and half their bodies hanging forward and down. In Europe they would fancy a child, &s;o left, would grow quite deformed; but it happens to the contrary. It renders their bodies &s;upple, and they are all of a &s;tature and port, which the be&s;t &s;haped among&s;t us would envy. The &s;hapes which mothers give to their childrens heads, however, cannot be ju&s;tified. There are, in this continent, &s;ome nations, which they call <HI>Flat-heads,</HI> who&s;e foreheads are very flat, and the top of their heads &s;omewhat length|ened. This &s;hape is not the work of nature; it is mothers that give it to their children, as &s;oon as born. For this end, they apply to their foreheads, and to the back part of their heads, two ma&s;&s;es of clay, or of &s;ome other heavy matter, which they bind on tighter and tighter, till the &s;kull has taken the &s;hape they wi&s;h. This operation is very painful to the child, and makes it &s;hed at the no&s;e, a whiti&s;h matter, pretty thick. But neither this circum&s;tance, nor the cries of the infant, alarm the mother, jealous of giving it a hand&s;ome appearance. On the other hand, many of the Al|gonquins, are called <HI>Round-heads;</HI> their di&s;tinction and beauty con&s;i&s;ting in having their heads perfectly round, which &s;hape, mothers take care very early to give them.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="161">They are of a very &s;warthy complexion, and many, about Florida, of a dirty, dark red. But this is not natural. The frequent paints and frictions they u&s;e, give this red colour, and con&s;idering how much ex|po&s;ed they are to the &s;un, in &s;ummer, and the &s;moke in winter, it is a wonder they are not &s;till darker.</P>
<P>The common idea of &s;avages, has been, that they are a hairy people; but, the &s;avages of North America are quite the rever&s;e; there is not a hair on their whole bodies, except on the head, eye-brows, and eye-la&s;hes, and yet their children are born with a thin hair, and pretty long, all over their bodies, but it di&s;appears after eight days. Old men have &s;ome hairs on their chin, as &s;ome old women have with us. The hair on their heads are very black, that on their eye-brows and eye-la&s;hes, they pull out by the roots. They e&s;teem this want of hair a great beauty, and think Europeans, with beards, frightful.</P>
<P>From their plain manner of living, they are very &s;wift of foot. One man, <HI>Charlevoix</HI> tells us, a&s;&s;ured him, that before he had eaten any bread, he could travel, on foot, forty leagues a day, and commonly, without fatigue, but that, &s;ince he had been u&s;ed to bread, he could not travel with the &s;ame ea&s;e.</P>
<P>They are, almo&s;t without exception, great walkers, will patiently endure cold, hunger, and fatigue, and
<PB N="153" REF="162">
bear all mi&s;fortunes, with &s;uch fortitude and re&s;ignation, as to enable them bravely to encounter the pro&s;pect of ill, and render the mind &s;erene under the pre&s;&s;ure of adver&s;ity.</P>
<P>Between Hud&s;on's Bay and California, there are many tribes of Indians, &s;ome of whom are known to Europeans, particularly the <HI>Ne-heth-aw-a</HI> Indians, the <HI>A&s;&s;inne-poetucs,</HI> the Fall-Indians, the <HI>Su&s;&s;ees,</HI> the Black|feet Indians, the Blood-Indians, and the <HI>Paegans.</HI> The&s;e are names they give them&s;elves, and it it is beyond a doubt, that there are European traders &s;ettled among them from the other &s;ide of the continent; I mean the Spaniards, making their inland excur&s;ions from Cali|fornia, as we do from Canada and Hud&s;on's Bay.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Indians are much inclined to a lean habit of body, and a corpulent Indian is a much greater curio&s;ity than a &s;ober one; this may be owing to their wandering life. As their country abounds with innumerable herds of deer, elks, and buffaloes, they frequently make great &s;laughter among them, from a maxim, that the more they kill, the more they have to kill: to which notion they are as much bigotted as the greate&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;t. And though they &s;ometimes find the folly of this maxim to their co&s;t, &s;uffering occa&s;ionally &s;uch extreme hun|ger through it, that parents have been reduced to the &s;ad nece&s;&s;ity of devouring their own offspring; yet they have pur&s;ued it. Yet they have a philo&s;ophy that recon|ciles
<PB N="154" REF="163">
all this, and a degree of compo&s;ure, &s;uperior to mo&s;t men. An Indian, after being out a whole day, upon the hunt, expo&s;ed to the bleake&s;t winds, and mo&s;t penetrating cold, without the lea&s;t thing to &s;atisfy the calls of nature, comes home, warms him&s;elf at the fire, &s;mokes a few pipes of tobacco, and then retires to re&s;t, as calm, as if in the mid&s;t of plenty. But, this does not proceed from in&s;en&s;ibility; for, if he happens to have a family, and this family is reduced to extremity of want, his affection for them gets the better of his philo&s;ophy, and he gives way to the mo&s;t pungent &s;orrow. He im|putes his di&s;tre&s;s and want, to &s;uper-natural cau&s;es, and to the capricious will of &s;ome invi&s;ible agent, whom he &s;uppo&s;es to pre&s;ide over all his undertakings.</P>
<P>Though I have &s;aid that the&s;e &s;avages will take pride in over-reaching an European in trade; where trade is not concerned, we &s;hall find in&s;tances of hone&s;ty and fidelity among them, that would do honour to a people governed by the wi&s;e&s;t laws, and re&s;trained by religion, from the commi&s;&s;ion of every enormity.</P>
<P>If one of the&s;e &s;avages commits murder, or any other enormous crime, his con&s;cience may upbraid him; but he is &s;o far from fearing corporal danger, from that &s;ociety, who&s;e peace he has di&s;turbed; that he will range through the wilds of a pathle&s;s country, and &s;eek a living where he plea&s;es, without fear of retaliation; for the country is &s;o exten&s;ive, that he will find out a &s;pot to live in, un|mole&s;ted,

where the offended party cannot, or dare not, go in &s;earch of him.</P>
<P>This in&s;tance of &s;avage liberty (for I &s;hall &s;peak again of their laws) is ju&s;t mentioned, to &s;hew, that though the Indian is guilty of taking away the life of a fellow-crea|ture; though he glories in the commi&s;&s;ion of dextrous theft, and will, without remor&s;e, exerci&s;e every inju&s;tice on his neighbour with impunity; yet, as he is not re|&s;trained by divine or human laws, from &s;uch acts of outrage, nor does the idea of temporal, or eternal, puni&s;hment, excite compunction in his mind; &s;urely the&s;e enormities are not of &s;o deep a dye, as if com|mitted by one who&s;e mind is enlightened, and who is &s;uppo&s;ed to have a more ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the claims of &s;ociety, and the injunctions of religion.</P>
<P>Nations are not di&s;tingui&s;hed here by their dre&s;s. The men, when it is hot, have often only &s;omething of an apron to cover their nakedne&s;s. In winter, they clothe them&s;elves more or le&s;s, according to the climate. They wear on their feet a &s;ort of &s;andals, made of roe-buck &s;kins, &s;moked; their &s;tockings are al&s;o &s;kins, or pieces of &s;tuffs, which they wrap round their legs. A wai&s;tcoat, made of &s;kin, covers them to the wai&s;t; and they wear over that, a rug, or blanket, when they can get one, or el&s;e make them&s;elves a robe of bear-&s;kin, with the hair inwards. The womens' wai&s;tcoats reach ju&s;t below their knees, and when it is very cold,
<PB N="156" REF="166">
or when they travel, they cover their heads with their blanket, or their robe. Some have little caps, like &s;cull-caps, others a &s;ort of capuchin, fa&s;tened to their wai&s;tcoats, and a piece of &s;tuff, that &s;erves them for a petticoat, and covers them from the wai&s;t to the middle of the leg.</P>
<P>They are all ambitious of having &s;hirts and &s;hifts, but never put them under their wai&s;tcoats, till they are dirty, and then they wear them, till they drop to pieces; for they never wa&s;h them. Their wai&s;tcoats, like their &s;andals, are generally &s;moke-dried, to give them a black colour, and rubbed, to &s;upple them. After this they are occa&s;ionally wa&s;hed.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of the Indians, between Hud&s;on's Bay and California, con&s;i&s;ts of a pair of &s;tockings, made of leather, dre&s;&s;ed fine, and pliable, like &s;hammy; a &s;ort of loo&s;e jacket, with &s;leeves of the &s;ame kind, and over all is thrown, a dre&s;t buffalo-&s;kin, or a blanket. Young men dre&s;s their hair in different forms, and paint their faces according to their fancies; but, men advanced in years, &s;eldom tye their hair, or paint their faces. The women's dre&s;s is like the men's. Caps are very &s;eldom worn by either male or female; but a dre&s;t otter-&s;kin is frequently wound round the heads of the men, the major part of which hangs down the back. <HI>(See the plate of the buffalo-pound.)</HI></P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="167">More to the &s;outhward, many make various figures all over their bodies, by pricking or puncturing them&s;elves: others, only in &s;ome parts. This is not done merely for or|nament, but they &s;ay, it defends them from the cold, ren|ders them le&s;s &s;en&s;ible of the other injuries of the air, and frees them from the per&s;ecutions of the gnats. It is about Virginia only, that they prick them&s;elves all over. In Canada, the greate&s;t part are &s;atisfied with &s;ome figures of birds, &s;erpents, or other animals, and even of leaves, and &s;uch like figures, according to their fancy; often in the face, and, &s;ometimes, even, on the eyelids. Many women are marked on the parts of the face, that an&s;wer to the jaw-bones, to prevent the tooth-ach.</P>
<P>The operation is not painful in it&s;elf. It is performed in this manner: They begin by tracing on the &s;kin, the figure they intend to make; then, in the&s;e lines, they prick little holes, clo&s;e together, with the fins of a fi&s;h, or with needles, &s;o as to draw blood; this done, they rub the part &s;o pricked, with charcoal-du&s;t, and other colours, well ground and powdered. The&s;e powders &s;ink into the &s;kin, and the figures are never ef|faced; but, &s;oon after the &s;kin &s;wells, and forms a kind of &s;cab, accompanied with inflammation; and if the weather is too hot, or the operation has been carried too far, there is danger of life.</P>
<P>The colours they u&s;e on the&s;e occa&s;ions, are tho&s;e with which they dye &s;kins, made from certain earths,
<PB N="158" REF="168">
and the bark of &s;ome trees. The men add to this or|nament, the down of &s;wans, or other birds, which they &s;trew upon their hair, after it has been grea&s;ed, like powder. They add to this feathers of all colours, and bunches of the hair of divers animals, all placed in an odd manner. The placing of their hair, &s;ometimes &s;tanding up like bri&s;tles on one &s;ide, and flatted on the other, or dre&s;&s;ed in a variety of fa&s;hions; pendants in their ears, and &s;ometimes in their no&s;trils; a great &s;hell of porcelain, hanging about their neck, or in their brea&s;t; &s;ome crowns made of plumage of &s;carce birds, the claws, feet, or heads, of birds of prey, little horns of roe-bucks; all the&s;e things make up their finery.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable, that the men take very little pains to adorn any part but their heads. It is ju&s;t the rever&s;e with the women. They wear &s;carcely any thing on the head, are fond only of their hair, and would think them|&s;elves di&s;graced, if it was cut off. When, therefore, at the death of a relation, they cut off any part of it, they mean, by this, to &s;hew the greate&s;t grief for their lo&s;s. To pre&s;erve their hair, they grea&s;e it often, and powder it with the du&s;t of &s;pruce-bark, and &s;ometimes with vermillion; they then wrap it up in the &s;kin of an eel, or &s;erpent, and &s;uffer it thus to hang down in tails to their wai&s;t. With re&s;pect to their faces, they content them|&s;elves with tracing &s;ome lines on them with vermillion, or other colours.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="169">Their no&s;trils are never bored, and it is only among &s;ome nations that they bore their ears; when they do, they wear in them, as do the men, pendants of China beads. When dre&s;&s;ed on gala-days, they have robes painted with all &s;orts of figures, with little collars of porcelain &s;et on them, and a kind of border, worked with porcupine's hair, which they paint al&s;o of various colours. In the &s;ame manner, they ornament their cradles, which are made of light wood, and have at the upper end hoops of cedar, to keep off the covering from the childs face.</P>
<P>Children's bodies not being confined in their infancy, as with us, they are very &s;upple in their limbs, and much &s;tronger, in proportion, than we are. Mothers &s;uckling them a long time, for &s;ix or &s;even years, adds not a little to their &s;trength, as does the hardy manner in which they are brought up. As &s;oon as they leave the cradle, and can crawl on their hands and feet, they are &s;uffered to go where they will, quite naked, into the water, into the woods, into the dirt, and into the &s;now. This makes them &s;ubject to di&s;orders in the &s;tomach, and lungs, which de&s;troy them early, but inures them, whil&s;t they live, to great hard&s;hips and fatigue. In &s;ummer, they run, as &s;oon as they are up, to the river or into the lakes, and continue there, a part of the day, playing about like fi&s;h, in fine weather.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="170">Their villages have generally no regular form. They are a heap of cabins, without order, or being &s;et in a line. Some like cart-hou&s;es, others like tunnels, built of bark, &s;upported by &s;ome few po&s;ts, &s;ometimes pla&s;tered on the out&s;ide with mud, in a coar&s;e manner, but, built with le&s;s art, neatne&s;s, and &s;olidity, than the cabins of the beavers, in this country. They are generally from 15 to 20 feet broad, and often a hun|dred in length; containing &s;everal fires, for as many families, about 30 feet between each fire-place.</P>
<P>When the floor is not &s;ufficient for all the inhabitants to &s;leep on, the young people lie on a wide bench, or kind of broad &s;helf, about five or &s;ix feet high, that runs the whole length of the cabin. The furniture and pro|vi&s;ions are over this, placed on pieces of wood, put acro&s;s the roof. Before the door, is u&s;ually a kind of porch, where the young people &s;leep in &s;ummer, and which &s;erves for a wood-hou&s;e in the winter. The doors are made of bark, fixed up like the umbrella of a window, and never &s;hut clo&s;e. The&s;e cabins have nei|ther chimnies, nor windows, but an opening is left in the middle of the roof, by which, part of the &s;moke goes out, which they are obliged to &s;hut when it rains or &s;nows, and then, if they would not be blinded, and &s;uffocated with &s;moke, they mu&s;t put out their fires.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="171">They fortify them&s;elves better than they lodge. Some villages are pretty will palli&s;adoed with redoubts, where they always take care to have a good provi&s;ion of water and &s;tones. The&s;e palli&s;adoes are double, and &s;ome|times treble, and have commonly battlements at the la&s;t enclo&s;ure. The po&s;ts they are compo&s;ed of, are in|tervoven with branches of trees, that leave no place open. Before they knew the u&s;e of fire-arms, this was &s;ufficient to maintain a long &s;iege. Every village has a pretty, large, open place; but &s;eldom of a regular figure.</P>
<P>The country they inhabit is very wild, and unculti|vated; but, not &s;o much as that which they chu&s;e for hunting. It is a long march to reach it, and they carry on their backs, all they want for five or &s;ix months, through ways &s;ometimes &s;o frightful, that one would &s;uppo&s;e no wild bea&s;t could come there. In the hunting &s;ea&s;on, they encamp on the &s;pot, erecting a temporary cabin, with poles, fixed in the &s;now, and covering it with bark, in a conical form; but the pieces of bark are &s;o ill-joined together, that the wind blows through on all &s;ides.</P>
<P>The &s;etting up of the&s;e cabins, is the work, only, of half an hour. Branches of pines &s;erve them for matts, and they have no other bed. The &s;now, heaped round about them, forms a &s;ort of wall, which the winds can|not penetrate; and by the &s;ide, and under the &s;helter of
<PB N="162" REF="172">
this wall, they &s;leep as quietly on the&s;e branches, covered with a poor &s;kin, as on the &s;ofte&s;t bed.</P>
<P>There being no outlet in the&s;e cabins, at top, for the &s;moke, there is con&s;tantly a cloud above; but the &s;avages accu&s;tomed to lie on the ground, are always below this cloud.</P>
<P>On &s;uch expeditions, the &s;avages are followed by a great number of dogs, which are very much attached to them. Being never fondled, they are not fawning; but, are bold and &s;kilful hunters. Every man has a great many of the&s;e dogs, for they are often killed by the teeth and horns of wild animals, which they attack with a courage that nothing can daunt. Their ma&s;ters taking little care to feed them, and living by what they can catch, they are always very lean. Having little or no hair on their backs, they are very &s;en&s;ible of the cold, and if they cannot get at the fire, will lie down on the fir&s;t &s;avage they approach; and if he awakes in the night, he will find him&s;elf almo&s;t &s;mothered with two or three dogs.</P>
<P>Their villages being always &s;ituated near woods, or on the &s;ide of &s;ome water, and often between both; as &s;oon as the air begins to grow warm, they are very much per&s;ecuted with mu&s;quitoes, and other, &s;mall flies; a much more grievous per&s;ecution then the &s;moke, and
<PB N="163" REF="173">
which they are often obliged to increa&s;e, to get rid of the&s;e in&s;ects.</P>
<P>The na&s;tine&s;s alone, of the cabins, and the &s;tench which naturally ari&s;es from it, is a real puni&s;hment to any one but a &s;avage. It is ea&s;y to judge how far both mu&s;t go, among people who never change their linen, or cloaths, but when they will hang on their backs no longer, and who take no care to wa&s;h them. In &s;um|mer they bathe every day, but rub them&s;elves, imme|diately after, with oil, or grea&s;e, of a &s;trong &s;cent, extracted from the &s;eed or root of &s;un-flowers.</P>
<P>All they eat, is not only without any &s;ea&s;oning, and commonly very in&s;ipid; but, there reigns in their meals, a &s;lovenline&s;s which exceeds all de&s;cription. There are few animals, but what feed cleaner. They live a good deal on maize, which is whole&s;ome grain, nouri&s;hing, and of light dige&s;tion. It is pre&s;erved by boiling it in lye, and when they u&s;e it, it is again boiled in water, or in broth, and eat with a little &s;alt. It is not an un|plea&s;ant food; but, &s;ome think the frequent u&s;e of it injurious, as the lye gives it a corro&s;ive quality. Of this grain they make the &s;agamitty, which is the mo&s;t com|mon food of the &s;avages; they broil it, pound it, take off the hu&s;k, and make a kind of broth of it. They love grea&s;e, and a few pound of candles, in a kettle of &s;aga|mitty, is an excellent &s;oup. They even &s;ometimes put
<PB N="164" REF="174">
things into it, which cannot be mentioned, and are &s;ur|prized to &s;ee our &s;tomachs turn at it.</P>
<P>The nations of the &s;outh have only ve&s;&s;els of baked earth to dre&s;s their meat. In Canada, and all the north, they u&s;e wooden kettles, and make the water boil by throwing in red-hot flints. Since their connexion with us, they u&s;e iron and tin-kettles. Among the we&s;tern nations, they &s;ub&s;titute wild oats for maize.</P>
<P>Among the wandering &s;avages, who never cultivate the earth; when the chace, and fi&s;hery fails, their only re&s;ource is a kind of mo&s;s, which grows on certain rocks, and which is called, <HI>Tripe of the Rocks.</HI> It is very in&s;ipid, and has but little &s;ub&s;tance, and is barely &s;uffi|cient to keep them from &s;tarving. "I have heard it affirmed," &s;ays <HI>Charlevoix,</HI> "by per&s;ons of credit, that &s;ome &s;avages eat, by way of dainty, a &s;ort of maize, le&s;t to rot, as we do hemp, in &s;tanding water, and take it out, black, and &s;tinking; and tho&s;e who have a liking to this &s;trange me&s;s, will not lo&s;e any of the muddy &s;ettlement that drops from it, the very &s;mell of which, makes the &s;tomachs of others heave. It was probably nece&s;&s;ity that di&s;covered this &s;ecret, and if this does not give it all it's reli&s;h, nothing proves more clearly, that there is no di&s;puting about ta&s;tes. They have now adopted the u&s;e of the potatoes, common to the We&s;t Indian i&s;lands, and find they thrive very well in Loui&s;iana.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="175">The little works of the women, and which are their common employment in the cabins, are to make thread of the inner membranes of the bark of a tree, which they call white wood, and they work it much as we do hemp. They al&s;o dye every thing, and make a variety of articles with bark, and ornament them with figures, in porcupines' hair. They make little cups, and other wooden uten&s;ils, paint and embroider buck-&s;kins, and knit girdles and garters, with the wool of the buffalo.</P>
<P>For the mo&s;t part, they help one another in the work of the field, and when it is time to gather in the harve&s;t, apply to the men for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. With their maize they &s;ow our running kidney-beans, and the &s;talk of the maize &s;upports them. Sun-flowers, water-melons, and pump|kins, they al&s;o rai&s;e in abundance; but before they &s;ow the &s;eed, make it &s;hoot in &s;moke, in light and black earth.</P>
<P>As for the men, they glory in their idlene&s;s, and in reality, pa&s;s above half their lives, in doing nothing; from a per&s;ua&s;ion, that daily labour di&s;graces a man, and is only the duty of the women. Man, they &s;ay, is only made for war, hunting, and fi&s;hing; but they make all the implements nece&s;&s;ary for the&s;e great exerci&s;es; &s;uch as arms, nets, canoes, rigging, their &s;now-&s;hoes, calling only occa&s;ionally the women to a&s;&s;i&s;t them. Chri&s;tian &s;avages employ them&s;elves in other things, but only by way of penance.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="176">Since America has been peopled, they are in no want of convenient tools for all their work. Before this, they were greatly embarra&s;&s;ed to cut down their trees, and fit them for u&s;e. They burnt them at the root, and to &s;plit and cut them, u&s;ed hatchets, made of flints, which did not break, but took up a great deal of time to &s;harpen them. To fix them in a handle, they cut off the head of a young tree, made a notch in it, as if they would have grafted it, in which they thru&s;t the head of the hatchet. After &s;ome time, the tree, by growing together, held the hatchet &s;o tight, that it would not come out; they then cut the tree, to &s;uch a length as they would have the handle.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of their Characters.</HEAD>
<P>SUCH &s;avages as have been converted to chri&s;tianity, retain nothing of their birth and original, but what is valuable; that is to &s;ay, the &s;implicity and freedom of the fir&s;t age of the world, with the addition of grace, the faith of the patriarchs, a &s;incere piety, that rectitude and docility of heart, which is the character of good men; an incredible innocence of manners, a pure
<PB N="167" REF="177">
chri&s;tianity, on which the world has never breathed its contagious air, and often actions of the mo&s;t heroic virtue.</P>
<P>Even in their natural character, with a &s;avage appear|ance, and manners, and cu&s;toms entirely barbarous, there is ob&s;ervable among them, a &s;ocial kindne&s;s, free from almo&s;t all the imperfections which &s;o often di&s;|turb the peace of &s;ociety, among us. They appear to be without pa&s;&s;ion; but, they do that, in cold blood, and &s;ometimes through principle, which the mo&s;t violent, and unbridled pa&s;&s;ion produces in tho&s;e who give no ear to rea&s;on. They &s;eem to lead the mo&s;t wretched life in the world; and, they were, perhaps, the only happy people on earth, before the knowledge of the objects, which &s;o much work upon and &s;educe us, had excited in them de&s;ires which ignorance kept in &s;upinene&s;s, and which have not, as yet, made any great ravages among them. We di&s;cover in them, a mixture of the pure&s;t, and mo&s;t gentle manners, the imperfections of wild bea&s;ts, and virtues and qualities of the heart and mind, which do the greate&s;t honour to human nature. One would think, at fir&s;t, that they have no form of govern|ment, that they acknowledge neither laws, nor &s;ubordi|nation; and, that, living in an entire independance, they &s;uffer them&s;elves to be &s;olely guided by chance, and the wilde&s;t caprice. Neverthele&s;s, they enjoy almo&s;t all the advantages, that a well regulated authority can procure from the be&s;t-governed nations. Born free and inde|pendent,
<PB N="168" REF="178">
they look with horror, even on the &s;hadow of a de&s;potic power; but &s;eldom depart from certain prin|ciples and cu&s;toms, founded on good &s;en&s;e, which are to them, a &s;ub&s;titute for laws; and which, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;upply the place of a lawful authority. They will not bear the lea&s;t re&s;traint; but, rea&s;on alone keeps them in a kind of &s;ubordination; which, for being voluntary, is not the le&s;s effectual to obtain the de&s;ired end.</P>
<P>A man, highly e&s;teemed by them, would find them docile enough, and would make them do almo&s;t what he plea&s;ed; but, it is not ea&s;y to obtain their e&s;teem, to &s;uch a degree. They never give it, but to merit, and &s;uperior merit, of which they are as good judges, as tho&s;e among&s;t us, who think they have the mo&s;t di&s;|cernment.</P>
<P>They rely much on phy&s;iognomy; and perhaps there are no men in the world, who are better judges of it. The rea&s;on is, they have none of that re&s;pect for men, which &s;o readily &s;educes us; and &s;tudying only pure nature, they have a perfect knowledge of it. Not being &s;laves, as we are, to ambition and intere&s;t, the equality of con|ditions, is no way nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;upport of their &s;ociety; of cour&s;e, we &s;eldom meet with tho&s;e haughty &s;pirits, who, full of their own grandeur or merit, fancy them&s;elves of a different &s;pecies, di&s;daining the re&s;t of mankind, by whom, of con&s;equence, they are never tru&s;ted or be|loved.
<PB N="169" REF="179">
Here all men conceive them&s;elves on an equa|lity; and in man, what they mo&s;t e&s;teem, is the man him&s;elf. Here is no di&s;tinction of birth; no prerogative allowed to rank, which hurts the rights of individuals; no pre-eminence given to merit, that in&s;pires pride, and makes other people feel too much their inferiority. They have, perhaps, le&s;s delicacy of &s;entiment, than among us, but they have more ju&s;tne&s;s. Religion alone can bring the good qualities of this people to perfection, and cure their evil ones; but, devoid of it, as they are, we can, in their mo&s;t indifferent actions, find &s;ome traces of the primitive religion, which e&s;capes the ob&s;er|vation of tho&s;e, who do not con&s;ider them with atten|tion; becau&s;e they are &s;till more effaced, through want of in&s;truction, than altered by a mixture of a &s;uper&s;titious wor&s;hip, or fabulous tradition.</P>
<P>Let us be more particular. Fathers and mothers, neglect nothing, to in&s;pire their children with certain principles of honour; which they pre&s;erve all their lives; but, of which, they often make a bad application; and, in this, their whole education con&s;i&s;ts. When they give them in&s;tructions on this head, it is always in an indirect way; the mo&s;t common, is, to relate to them, the brave actions of their ance&s;tors, or of their countrymen. The young people are fired at the&s;e &s;tories, and are never ea&s;y, till they find an opportunity, of imitating the ex|amples, they are taught to admire. To correct them for their faults, they u&s;e intreaties and tears, but never
<PB N="170" REF="180">
menaces; for menaces would make no impre&s;&s;ion, on &s;pirits prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with an opinion, that no per&s;on has a right to u&s;e compul&s;ion.</P>
<P>A mother, who &s;ees her daughter behave ill, cries; on the daughter's a&s;king the cau&s;e of her tears, &s;he is &s;atisfied with &s;aying, "You di&s;grace me." It &s;eldom happens, that this way of reproving is not effectual. But &s;ince their intercour&s;e with Europeans, tho&s;e (and tho&s;e only) who are converted to chri&s;tianity, or are &s;ettled in the colonies, cha&s;ti&s;e their children. The greate&s;t cha&s;|ti&s;ement, however, is throwing a little water in the childs face. Girls have been known to hang them&s;elves, for having only received a &s;light reprimand from their mothers, or a few drops of water in their faces, and who have given notice of it, by &s;aying, "You &s;hall lo&s;e your daughter." The greate&s;t misfortune is, that it is not to virtue, they exhort their children, but to revenge.</P>
<P>One would expect, that a childhood, &s;o badly di&s;ci|plined, &s;hould be followed by a youth of turbulence and corruption. No. They are naturally calm, and early ma&s;ters of them&s;elves. Rea&s;on guides them more than other men, and in the&s;e northern climes, their con&s;titu|tion does not incline them to exce&s;s, or debauchery; yet, we find &s;ome cu&s;toms among them, in which cha&s;tity is entirely di&s;regarded; but more from &s;uper&s;ti|tion than depravity.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="181">The Hurons, till their intercour&s;e with Europeans, were very la&s;civious and brutal in their plea&s;ures. Young per&s;ons, of both &s;exes, abandoned them&s;elves, without &s;hame, to all manner of di&s;&s;olutene&s;s. And it was e&s;teemed no crime for a girl to pro&s;titute her&s;elf: their parents were the fir&s;t to engage them in this way, and many, for intere&s;t, did the &s;ame by their wives. Many never mar|ried, but took young women, to &s;erve them, as they &s;aid, for companions; and all the difference they made between the&s;e concubines, and their lawful wives, was, that with the fir&s;t, an agreement was made. Indeed, all their children were on the &s;ame footing; which, in a coun|try where there are no e&s;tates to inherit, can produce no inconvenience.</P>
<P>In the &s;outhern countries, they have but little re&s;traint in the article of women, who, on their &s;ide, are very la&s;civious; and hence has aro&s;e, that corruption of man|ners which has infected the northern nations.

<P>A Huron captain was one day in&s;ulted and &s;truck by young man. Tho&s;e who were pre&s;ent, would have puni&s;hed this audaciou&s;ne&s;s on the &s;pot. "Let him alone," &s;aid the Captain, "did not you feel the earth tremble?&mdash;He is &s;ufficiently informed of his folly."</P>
<P>Their con&s;tancy in &s;uffering pain, is beyond all ex|pre&s;&s;ion. A young woman, &s;hall be a whole day in labour, without making one cry. If &s;he &s;hewed the lea&s;t weakne&s;s, &s;he would be e&s;teemed unworthy to be a mother; becau&s;e, as they &s;ay, &s;he would bring forth cowards.</P>
<P>Nothing is more common, than to &s;ee per&s;ons of all ages, and of both &s;exes, &s;uffer, for many hours, and &s;ometimes, many days together, the &s;harpe&s;t effects of fire; and all that the mo&s;t indu&s;trious fury can invent, to make it mo&s;t painful, without letting a &s;igh e&s;cape.

They are employed, for the mo&s;t part, during their &s;uf|ferings, in encouraging their tormentors by the mo&s;t in&s;ulting reproaches.</P>
<P>An Outagama, who was burnt by the Illinois, with the utmo&s;t cruelty, perceiving a Frenchman among the &s;pectators, begged of him to help his enemies to torment him; and, on being a&s;ked, why he made this reque&s;t, replied: "Becau&s;e I &s;hould have the comfort of dying by the hands of a <HI>man.</HI> My greate&s;t grief," adds he, "is, that I never killed a man." "But." &s;aid the Illinois, "you have killed &s;uch, and &s;uch a per&s;on." "As for the Illinois," replied the pri&s;oner, "I have killed enough of them, but they are no <HI>men."</HI></P>
<P>Some men would call this conduct in&s;en&s;ibility; but, to elevate the &s;oul, above the &s;en&s;e of pain, to &s;uch a degree, there mu&s;t always be an effort, which common &s;ouls are not capable of. The &s;avages exerci&s;e them|&s;elves in this, all their lives, and accu&s;tom their children to it, from their tendere&s;t years. Little boys and girls have been &s;een to tye them&s;elves together, by one arm, and put a lighted coal between them, to &s;ee which would &s;hake it off fir&s;t. In &s;hort, we mu&s;t allow, with Cicero, that a habit of labour, makes us bear pain more ea&s;ily: But what proves mo&s;t, that this kind of in&s;en&s;i|bility in the&s;e barbarians, is the effect of true courage, is, that it is not found in all of them.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="184">It is not &s;urpri&s;ing, that with &s;uch greatne&s;s of &s;oul, and &s;uch elevated &s;entiments, the&s;e &s;avages &s;hould be intrepid in danger, and of a courage, proof again&s;t every thing. It is true, that, in their way, they expo&s;e them&s;elves as little as po&s;&s;ible, it bring their chief glory, not to buy their victory too dear; and their nations not being numerous, they are unwilling to weaken them; but when they mu&s;t fight, they do it like lions; and the &s;ight of their blood does but increa&s;e their &s;trength and their courage.</P>
<P>But what &s;urpri&s;es infinitely, in men, who&s;e whole outward appearance proclaims nothing but barbarity, is to &s;ee them behave to each other, with &s;uch kindne&s;s, and regard, that is not to be found among the mo&s;t civilized nations. This doubtle&s;s proceeds from the words <HI>mine</HI> and <HI>thine,</HI> being, as yet, unknown to the&s;e &s;avages. We are equally charmed with that natural and unaffected gravity, which reigns in all their behavi|our, in all their actions, and the greate&s;t part of their diver&s;ions; as likewi&s;e with the civility and deference they &s;hew to their equals, and the re&s;pect of young people to the aged; and la&s;tly, never to &s;ee them quarrel among them&s;elves, with tho&s;e indecent ex|pre&s;&s;ions, and the oaths and cur&s;es, &s;o common among&s;t us. All which are proofs of good &s;en&s;e, and a great command of temper.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="185">One of their principles, and that of which they are mo&s;t jealous, is, that one man owes nothing to another. But from this bad maxim they draw a good inference; that is to &s;ay, that we mu&s;t never do an injury to any per&s;on, from whom we have received no wrong. There is nothing wanting to their happine&s;s, but to behave between nation and nation, as they do between private per&s;ons, and never to attack any people, of whom they have no cau&s;e to complain.</P>
<P>On the other hand, it mu&s;t be allowed, that what we mo&s;t admire in the &s;avages, is not always pure virtue; that con&s;titution and vanity have a great &s;hare in it, and that their be&s;t qualities are tarni&s;hed by great vices. The&s;e men, who, at fir&s;t view, appear to us &s;o contempti|ble, of all mankind, have the greate&s;t contempt for all others, and the highe&s;t opinion of them&s;elves. They are di&s;tru&s;tful and &s;u&s;picious of Europeans; treacherous, when their intere&s;t is concerned; di&s;&s;emblers, and re|vengeful in the extreme. Time does not wear out their revenge; it is the mo&s;t precious inheritance, which they leave to their children, and which is tran&s;mitted from generation to generation, till they find an opportunity to execute it.</P>
<P>As to what we call, more particularly, the qualities of the heart, the&s;e &s;avages do not value them&s;elves much on, or con&s;ider them as virtues. Friend&s;hip, compa&s;&s;ion gratitude, attachment, are, with them, le&s;s the effect of a
<PB N="176" REF="186">
good di&s;po&s;ition, than of reflection and in&s;tinct. The care they take of orphans, widows, and the infirm, and the ho&s;pitality they exerci&s;e, in &s;uch an admirable man|ner; are, to them, only the con&s;equence of their per&s;ua|&s;ion, that all things ought to be common among men. Fathers and mothers have a fondne&s;s for their children, which ri&s;es even to weakne&s;s, but which does not in|cline them, to make them virtuous; and which appears to be truly animal; children, on their part, have no natural gratitude for their parents, and even treat their fathers &s;ometimes with indignity. The following is a public notoriety, and will give the reader a good idea of their notions on this head.</P>
<P>An Irroquois, who &s;erved a long time in the Euro|pean troops, again&s;t his own nation, and even as an officer; met his father in an engagement, and was going to kill him; when he di&s;covered who he was, he with|held his hand, and &s;aid to him. "You have once given <HI>me</HI> life, and now I give it to <HI>you.</HI> Let me meet with you no more; for I have paid the debt I owed you." Nothing can better prove the nece&s;&s;ity of education, and that nature alone does not &s;ufficiently in&s;truct us in our mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential duties. And what demon&s;trates more evi|dently the advantage of the chri&s;tian religion is, that it has produced in the hearts of tho&s;e barbarians, in all the&s;e re&s;pects, a very wonderful change.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="187">But, if the &s;avages know not how to ta&s;te the &s;weets of friend&s;hip, they have at lea&s;t di&s;covered its u&s;efulne&s;s. Every one among&s;t them has a friend nearly of his own age, between whom there is a mutual engagement, which is indi&s;&s;oluble. Two men, thus united for their common intere&s;t, are obliged to do every thing, and to run all hazards, to a&s;&s;i&s;t and &s;uccour each other. Death it&s;elf, as they believe, &s;eparates them only for a time. They rely on meeting again in the next world, never to part more, being per&s;uaded, that they &s;hall there want each other's a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t acknowledge, that, at the fir&s;t view, the life they lead, appears very hard; but, when it is con|&s;idered, that cu&s;tom is &s;econd nature, and that the liberty they enjoy, &s;ufficiently compen&s;ates the lo&s;s of tho&s;e conveniences they are deprived of; the hard&s;hip di&s;appears. What we &s;ee every day, in &s;ome beggars, by profe&s;&s;ion; and in &s;everal per&s;ons in country-life, gives us a &s;en&s;ible proof, that we may be happy in the mid&s;t of indigence. But the&s;e &s;avages are &s;till more happy; fir&s;t, becau&s;e they think them&s;elves &s;o; &s;econdly, be|cau&s;e they are in the peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t precious of all the gifts of nature; and la&s;tly, becau&s;e they are entirely ignorant of, and have not even a de&s;ire to know, the fal&s;e advantages which we &s;o much e&s;teem, which we purcha&s;e at the expence of real good, and of which we have &s;o little true enjoyment.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="188">We cannot even &s;ay, that they like their own way of living, only becau&s;e they are not acquainted with the &s;weetne&s;s of ours; for many of the French have lived like them, and have been &s;o well plea&s;ed with it, as not to be prevailed on to return, though they might have been much at their ca&s;e in the colony they left: And, on the other hand, &s;avage children have been taken from the cradle, brought up among&s;t Europeans, with much care, and nothing omitted to prevent their knowing what pa&s;&s;ed among their parents; and yet, the force of blood has prevailed over education; and, as &s;oon as they found them&s;elves at liberty, they have torn their gar|ments to pieces, and run into the woods, in &s;earch of their countrymen, who&s;e way of life &s;eemed to them more plea&s;ing, than that they led before.</P>
<P>The Irroquois I have mentioned, who&s;e name was <HI>La Plaque;</HI> and who, in &s;aving his father's life in an engagement, thought he had fully &s;atisfied all the debt he owed him, was made a lieutenant in the French &s;er|vice to fix him, becau&s;e he was a very brave man; but he would not continue in their way of living. He returned to his nation, only carrying with him, the French vices, without correcting any of tho&s;e he brought with him. He loved women to exce&s;s. He was well &s;haped. His valour, and his brave actions, gave him great re|putation. He had a great deal of wit, and very amia|ble manners. He had many intrigues with other men's wives, and his di&s;orders went &s;o far, that it was debated
<PB N="179" REF="189">
in the council of his canton, whether they &s;hould not take him off. It was, however, concluded, by the majority of votes, to &s;pare his life, becau&s;e, being ex|tremely courageous, he might people the country with good warriors.</P>
<P>With all their defects, it is certain, as men, they have great advantages over us; the chief of which is, a greater perfection of their &s;en&s;es, both external and internal. In &s;pite of the &s;now that dazzles their eyes, and the &s;moke, which almo&s;t &s;mothers them for &s;ix months in the year, their &s;ight never decays. Their hearing is extremely quick, and their &s;melling is exqui|&s;ite; they &s;mell fire a long time before they di&s;cover it. On account of this perfection of &s;melling, they can't bear the &s;cent of mu&s;k, nor any &s;trong &s;mell.</P>
<P>Their apprehen&s;ion is wonderful. It is enough for them to have been once in a place, to have an exact idea of it, which is never effaced. Let a fore&s;t be ever &s;o large and pathle&s;s, when they have well con&s;idered certain marks, by which they guide them&s;elves, they will cro&s;s it without wandering.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Nova Scotia, and of the environs of the gulph of St. Lawrence, in their canoes of bark, (to pa&s;s over to the Labrador coa&s;t, in &s;earch of the E&s;ki|maux, with whom they were at war), would go 30 or 40 leagues on the main &s;ea, without a compa&s;s, and

make the land, exactly at the place they propo&s;ed. The pole-&s;tar is their guide by night; and, in the mo&s;t cloudy weather, they will follow the &s;un many days, without making any mi&s;take. The be&s;t clock cannot give better information of the progre&s;s of the &s;un, then they can, by viewing the &s;ky; &s;o that, do what you can to put them out of their way, 'tis very rare that they lo&s;e their route. They are born with this talent. It is not the fruit of ob&s;ervation, nor of long cu&s;tom. Youth, who never before went out of their village, travel as &s;ecurely as tho&s;e, who have been mo&s;t u&s;ed to range the country.</P>
<P>As to the &s;tars and planets, the cau&s;es of the cele&s;tial appearances, meteors, and the like, they are not only perfectly ignorant of, but indifferent about. An eclip&s;e they &s;uppo&s;e to be a great combat in the heavens, and they &s;hoot many arrows into the air, to drive away the pretended enemies of the &s;un and moon. The Hurons, when the moon is eclip&s;ed, &s;uppo&s;e &s;he is &s;ick, and to recover her from this &s;ickne&s;s, make a great noi&s;e, as the Chine&s;e do, from a conception, that the planet is attacked by a dragon. The Hurons accompany their noi&s;e with many ceremonies and prayers, and never fail to fall upon the dogs with &s;ticks and &s;tones, to &s;et them a yelping, becau&s;e they believe the moon loves the&s;e animals.</P>

<P>Their manner of dividing time, is by months; &s;ome reckoning twelve, &s;ome thirteen. They have not among them, any di&s;tinction of weeks, nor any names for particular days. They have four, fixed parts in the day; &s;un-ri&s;e, and &s;un-&s;et, noon, and midnight. They have no chronological computations, and if they pre|&s;erve the epochas of certain events, they cannot com|prehend the exact time &s;ince they happened. They are &s;atisfied with remembering the facts, and have invented &s;everal ways of pre&s;erving the remembrance of them; by keeping in their hou&s;es, &s;trings of beads, on which are wrought figures, that revive the memory of tran&s;ac|tions. In counting, they reckon from one to ten, the tens, by 10 to a 100, and the hundreds, by 10 to 1000; beyond this, they cannot go. But, the beauty of their imagination is equal to its vivacity; and this appears in all their di&s;cour&s;e. They are quick at repartee, and their &s;peeches are full of &s;hining pa&s;&s;ages, that would have been applauded in the public a&s;&s;emblies of Rome and Athens. Their eloquence has &s;omething in it &s;o &s;trong, &s;o natural, &s;o pathetic, that art cannot attain it, and which the Greeks &s;o much admired in the barba|rians; and, though it does not &s;eem to be &s;upported by action; though they make no ge&s;tures, and do not rai&s;e

their voice; we feel, they are thoroughly affected with what they &s;ay, and their eloquence is per&s;ua&s;ive.</P>
<P>It would be &s;trange, that, with &s;uch a fine imagina|tion, they &s;hould not have an excellent memory. Though de&s;titute of all the artificial helps, we have in|vented, to a&s;&s;i&s;t us, or &s;upply its defects; it is &s;carcely credible, of how many matters, with what particular circum&s;tances, and with how much order, they treat in their councils. On &s;ome occa&s;ions, however, they u&s;e little &s;ticks, to recollect the articles they are to di&s;cu&s;s; and, by this, they, form a local memory, &s;o certain, that they will &s;peak four or five hours together, without forgetting any thing, and without the lea&s;t he&s;itation. Their narration is clear and exact, and though they u&s;e many allegories, and other figures, it is animated, and has all the plea&s;ing turns which their language affords.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Of their Amu&s;ements, and Dances.</HEAD>
<P>THEIR amu&s;ements are, the game of the di&s;h, the game of the &s;traws, and that of the bat, with &s;undry dances.</P>
<P>The game of the di&s;h, or bones, is what they are mo&s;t fond of, at which they will &s;ometimes lo&s;e their re&s;t, and, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, their rea&s;on. They will hazard, at it, all they po&s;&s;e&s;s, and many will not quit it, till they are &s;tripped, and have lo&s;t all they have in their cabins; &s;ome have been &s;o ra&s;h, as even to &s;take their liberty. This game is played by two per&s;ons; each has eight, little bones, the &s;ize of apricot-&s;tones, with &s;ix unequal &s;urfaces, two of which are painted black. They make them jump up, by &s;triking the ground, or a table, with a hollow di&s;h, in which they are contained. When they have no di&s;h, they throw them up in the air, with their hands. If in falling, they come up all one colour, the thrower wins five. The game is 40 up, and they &s;ub&s;tract the number gained by the oppo&s;ite party. Five bones of the &s;ame colour, wins one, for the fir&s;t time; but, the &s;econd time, they win the game. A le&s;s number wins nothing. He that
<PB N="184" REF="194">
wins the game, continues playing, and another takes the lo&s;ers place. A whole village is often concerned in this game. One village will often play again&s;t ano|ther. Each party chu&s;es a marker. At every deci&s;ive throw, they &s;hout. The players appear like people po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and the &s;pectators are not more calm. They all make a thou&s;and contor&s;ions, talk to the bones, load the &s;pirit or genius of the adver&s;e party, with impre|cations, and the whole village echoes with howlings. If all this does not recover their luck; by treating the company, they may put off the party, till next day.</P>
<P>Then they prepare to return to the engagement. Each invokes his genius, and throws &s;ome tobacco into the fire, to his honour. Above all things they con&s;ult him for lucky dreams. At break of day, they proceed again to play; but, if the lo&s;ers fancy, (for they are very &s;uper&s;titious), that the goods in their cabins made them unlucky. The fir&s;t thing they do, is to change them all. Great parties com|monly la&s;t five or &s;ix days, and often continue all night. In the mean time, as all the per&s;ons pre&s;ent, at lea&s;t, tho&s;e who are concerned in the game, are in agita|tion that deprives them of rea&s;on; as they quarrel and fight, which never happens among the &s;avages, but on the&s;e occa&s;ions, and in drunkenne&s;s; we may well &s;ay, that when they have done playing, they mu&s;t want re&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="195">It happens, &s;ometimes, that the&s;e parties of play are made by order of the phy&s;ician, or at the reque&s;t of a &s;ick per&s;on, in hopes of a cure. There needs no more, for this purpo&s;e, than a dream, of one or the other, which is always conceived, as the order of &s;ome &s;pirit. They then prepare them&s;elves for play, with a great deal of care; a&s;&s;emble for &s;everal nights, to try, and &s;ee who has the luckie&s;t hand, con&s;ult their genii, fa&s;t, and the married per&s;ons ob&s;erve continence: and all to obtain a favourable dream. Every morning they relate their dreams; and he, who&s;e dream is &s;up|po&s;ed mo&s;t favourable, is made to &s;tand next him who holds the di&s;h. They will even go a great way to fetch him; and if, through age or infirmity, he cannot walk, they will carry him on their &s;houlders.</P>
<P>The game at &s;traws is thus played: The&s;e &s;traws are &s;mall reeds, about the &s;ize of a wheat &s;traw, and about &s;ix inches long. Two hundred and one of the&s;e, being &s;huffled together, after a thou&s;and contor&s;ions, and invokings of their genii, they &s;eparate them, with a kind of awl, into nine parcels of 10 each; and one of 11. Every one then draws a parcel, and he who gets that containing 11, wins the point agreed on. The whole game is 60 or 80.</P>
<P>The game of the bat, is played with a ball, and bent &s;ticks, ending in a kind of racket. They &s;et up two po&s;ts, at a certain di&s;tance, according to the number
<PB N="186" REF="196">
of players, as bounds. For in&s;tance, if there are 80, the di&s;tance between the po&s;ts, is half a league. The players are divided into two bands, each having his &s;ta|tion, and their bu&s;ine&s;s is to &s;trike the ball to the po&s;t of the adver&s;e party, without letting it fall to the ground, and without touching it with the hand, for in either of the&s;e ca&s;es the game is lo&s;t; and they are &s;o dextrous at catching the ball with their bats, that, &s;ometimes, one game will la&s;t many days together.</P>
<P>Of their dances, the fir&s;t is merely for diver&s;ion. As &s;oon as it is night, they &s;et up, in a large cabin, &s;everal po&s;ts, in a ring, in the mid&s;t of which &s;it the mu&s;ic. On each po&s;t is placed a packet of down, of different colours. The young people, mingled together, dance round the&s;e po&s;ts. The young women have, al&s;o, a tuft of coloured down in their bo&s;oms. From time to time, a young man &s;teps out of the ring, takes from the po&s;ts a little of the down, of which the girl he likes has &s;ome in her bo&s;om, of the &s;ame colour; puts it on his head, dances round her, and, by a &s;ign, appoints her a place of rendezvous. When the dance is over, the fea&s;t begins, and la&s;ts all day. At night, every one re|tires, and the young women manage matters &s;o well, that, in &s;pite of the vigilance of their mothers, they &s;teal to the place of a&s;&s;ignation; and &s;oon after become mothers them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="197">Another dance among them, in which five or &s;ix women dance, is called the fire-dance, by the &s;ound of a drum, and a <HI>Chichikou&eacute;,</HI> which is a kind of caliba&s;h full of pebbles, and rattled. They range them&s;elves in a line, &s;ide by &s;ide, with their arms hanging down; and, without breaking the line, &s;ing, and make &s;ome &s;teps in cadence, backwards and forwards. This is at night, in a cabin, by fire-light. When the women have danced &s;ome time, the fire is put out, and a &s;avage, with a lighted coal in his mouth, makes his appearance and dances, and by the faint gloom of this coal, he looks like a &s;pectre. The mixture of dances, &s;ongs, and in|&s;truments, and the fire of the coal, which continues for near half-an-hour, has &s;omething odd and &s;avage in it. The contra&s;t of the voices, of the men and women, at a certain di&s;tance, has a pretty effect, and if they had a good manner of &s;inging, it would be a plea&s;ure to hear them &s;ing.</P>
<P>Their art of being able to keep a burning coal in their mouths, is a &s;ecret they keep to them&s;elves. They rub the in&s;ide of their mouths with a particular plant. Some &s;ay, it is the leaf of the Canada anemony. Gar|lick and onions will produce this effect, and &s;ecure the part from burning, for a &s;hort time; but the plant the&s;e &s;avages u&s;e, will &s;ecure them for more than half-an-hour.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="198">There are dances, pre&s;cribed by their phy&s;icians, for the cure of the &s;ick; but they are generally very la&s;civious. They are almo&s;t always in circles, to the &s;ound of the drum, and the <HI>Chichikou&eacute;,</HI> the men apart from the women. As their mu&s;ic has but two or three notes, and is continually repeated, they dance always in time.</P>
<P>Their other dances are military, one is rather a mili|tary feat. The warriors are the actors; and, it &s;eems, in&s;tituted merely to give them an opportunity of publi&s;h|ing their great atchievements in war. They decorate the calumet with feathers, and &s;et it up in the mo&s;t con|&s;picuous place among them. Calumet is a Norman word, and &s;ignifies reed. The calumet of the &s;avages, is properly the tube of a pipe; but they comprehend under this name, the pipe al&s;o, as well as its tube. The tube of that for ceremonial u&s;es, is made of a light wood; painted with different colours, and adorned with the head, tails, and feathers of the fine&s;t birds. The bowl is made of a reddi&s;h marble. The cu&s;tom is to &s;moke in the calumet, when it is accepted; and perhaps there is no in&s;tance, where the agreement has been violated, which was made by this acceptation. The &s;avages are, at lea&s;t, per&s;uaded, that the Great Spirit, would not leave &s;uch a breach of faith unpuni&s;hed. If, in the mid&s;t of battle, the enemy pre&s;ents a calumet, it is allowable to refu&s;e it; but, if they receive it, they mu&s;t in&s;tantly lay down their arms, and peace is the con&s;equence. There are calumets for every kind of treaty. In making tho&s;e &s;moke in
<PB N="189" REF="199">
the calumet, with whom they would trade or treat, they call the &s;un for witne&s;s, and as a guarantee of their engagement; for they never fail to blow the &s;moke towards the &s;un. There are per&s;ons, who have &s;uppo&s;ed this calumet to have originated in the Cadu|ceus of Mercury; and the more &s;o, becau&s;e they en|grave a &s;erpent on the tube; but, as the caduceus has no relation to the &s;un, and there is no tradition among the &s;avages, that gives any room to judge they ever had any knowledge of the Greek mythology, it is mo&s;t rational to &s;uppo&s;e, that the&s;e people could not find any &s;igns more natural to denote a &s;trict union, than to &s;moke in the &s;ame pipe; e&s;pecially if the &s;moke they draw is offered to a deity, who puts the &s;eal of religion to it. To &s;moke in the &s;ame pipe, therefore, in token of alliance, is the &s;ame thing as to drink out of the &s;ame cup, as has been practi&s;ed, at all times, by many nations.</P>
<P>Now this calumet being &s;et up in view, the band of mu&s;ic, and the dancers round it, the &s;pectators divided here and there in companies; the women &s;eparate from the men, all &s;eated on the ground, and dre&s;&s;ed in their fine&s;t robes, at &s;ome di&s;tance, make a pretty &s;hew.</P>
<P>Before the mu&s;ic a po&s;t is erected, on which, at the end of every dance, a warrior advances, and gives a &s;troke with his hatchet. This is the &s;ignal for &s;ilence, and this man repeats, with a loud voice, &s;ome of his
<PB N="190" REF="200">
great feats; and, having received the applau&s;es of the &s;pectators, goes, takes his place again, and the dance is continued; which &s;eems to have no meaning, and con&s;i&s;ts wholly of contor&s;ions.</P>
<P>The dance of di&s;covery is performed by one man, and is a natural repre&s;entation of all that pa&s;&s;es in an expedition of war. At fir&s;t he advances &s;lowly into the mid&s;t of the place, where he remains, for &s;ome time, motionle&s;s; after which he repre&s;ents, one after another, the &s;etting out of the warriors, the march, the encamp|ing; he goes on the di&s;covery, makes his approach, &s;tops to take breath; then, all on a &s;udden, grows furious, and one would imagine, was going to kill every body; then he appears more calm, and takes one of the company as pri&s;oner; he makes a &s;hew of knocking another man's brains out; levels his gun at a third, and, la&s;tly, &s;ets up a running with all his might; then &s;tops, and recovers him&s;elf. This is to repre&s;ent a retreat, at fir&s;t precipitate, and afterwards le&s;s &s;o. Then he expre&s;&s;es, by different cries, the various affections of his mind during his la&s;t campaign; and fini&s;hes, by reciting all the brave actions he has performed in war.</P>
<P>There are other dances, le&s;s compounded, de&s;igned merely to give the warriors an opportunity of relating their atchievements. He who gives the fea&s;t invites all the village by beat of drum, and they meet in his cabin, if it is large enough to contain them all. The warriors
<PB N="191" REF="201">
dance, one after another; then, &s;triking on a po&s;t for &s;ilence, they &s;ay what they plea&s;e, and &s;top, from time to time, to receive applau&s;e, which is generally given in abundance; but if he boa&s;ts of feats he never performed, any per&s;on is allowed to rub the boa&s;ters head with dirt and a&s;hes, or play him any other trick he likes. Commonly they blacken his face, &s;aying, "What I do, is to hide your &s;hame; for, the fir&s;t time you &s;ee the enemy, you will turn pale." This dance is always performed at night.</P>
<P>In the we&s;tern parts, they have the dance of the bull; in which the dancers form &s;everal circles, and the mu&s;ic, which is always the drum, and the <HI>chichikou&eacute;,</HI> is in the middle. They never &s;eparate tho&s;e of the &s;ame family. The dancers do not join hands; and every one carries in his hand his arms and his buckler. All the circles do not turn the &s;ame way, and though they caper much, and very high, they always keep time and mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>From time to time, the chief of a family pre&s;ents his &s;hield, which is covered with a bull's hide. They all &s;trike upon it; and, at every &s;troke, he repeats &s;ome of his exploits. Then he goes, and cuts a piece of tobacco, at a po&s;t where &s;ome is hung, and gives it to one of his friends. If any one can prove that he has performed greater feats, or had a &s;hare in tho&s;e the other boa&s;ts
<PB N="192" REF="202">
of, he has a right to take the piece of tobacco, that was pre&s;ented, and give it to another. This dance is followed by a fea&s;t.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of the Manner of Hunting, Animals, Marriages, Births, Funerals, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>AS the Canadian &s;avages live chiefly by hunting, it may not be unentertaining to give a de&s;cription of their bear-hunt, which holds the fir&s;t place in this part of their employ; and which, among tho&s;e who are not converted to chri&s;tianity, is performed with the greate&s;t &s;uper&s;tition. My readers may compare it with the mode the Laplanders pur&s;ue, and which is related in the fir&s;t volume of this work.</P>
<P>It is always a war chief, who fixes the time, and has the care of inviting the hunters. This invitation is made with great ceremony, and is followed with a fa&s;t of eight days, during which they do not drink, even a drop of water: and their fa&s;ting is ab&s;taining from all kinds of food. In &s;pite of the extreme weakne&s;s which &s;uch an ab&s;tinence occa&s;ions, they never cea&s;e &s;inging all the time it la&s;ts. This fa&s;t is to induce the genii or &s;pirits to
<PB N="193" REF="203">
di&s;cover the places where they may find many bears. Some even do much more to de&s;erve this favour. Se|veral have been &s;een to cut their fle&s;h, in &s;everal parts of their bodies, to render their genii, or &s;pirits, more pro|pitious; but they do not a&s;k their a&s;&s;i&s;tance to conquer the&s;e furious animals; they wi&s;h only to be told where to find them. As Ajax did not a&s;k Jupiter to give him victory over his enemies, but only day-light enough to make an end of his conque&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;avages &s;upplicate al&s;o, on the &s;ame account, the manes of the bea&s;ts which they have killed in former huntings. The fa&s;t being over, and the place of the hunt being &s;ettled, the chief, who is cho&s;en for the chace, gives his party a great fea&s;t, but no one dares be thereat, till he has bathed; that is, till he has fir&s;t plunged him|&s;elf into the river, if not frozen, let the weather be ever &s;o &s;evere. Though they have fa&s;ted long, at this fea&s;t they eat moderately. The ma&s;ter of the fea&s;t eats nothing, his whole bu&s;ine&s;s, whil&s;t his gue&s;ts are eating, being to relate his prowe&s;s at former huntings. Fre&s;h invocations, of the manes of dead bea&s;ts, fini&s;h the re|pa&s;t. Then they begin their march, equipped as for war; their faces be&s;meared with black, amid the ac|clamations of the whole village; for the chace, among the&s;e people, is as noble as war. The alliance of a good hunter, is more &s;ought after, than that of a famous warrior; but a man is not e&s;teemed a good hunter, till he has killed 12 great bea&s;ts in one day. Winter is the
<PB N="194" REF="204">
hunting &s;ea&s;on. It does not require much running to catch them. When the hunters think they have found the places where a great number are hid, they form a cir|cle, of a quarter of a league in circumference, more or le&s;s, according to the number of hunters, and thus draw nearer and nearer, till they quite clo&s;e in upon them and take them.</P>
<P>When a bear is killed, the hunter puts the end of his lighted pipe between his teeth, blows into the bowl, and, thus filling the mouth and throat of the bea&s;t with &s;moke, conjures its &s;pirit, to bear him no malice, for what he has ju&s;t done to the body, and not to oppo&s;e him in his future huntings. But, as the &s;pirit does not an&s;wer, the hunter (to know if his prayer is granted) cuts the &s;tring under the bear's tongue, and keeps it till he returns to the village. Then they all throw, with great ceremony, and after many invocations, the&s;e &s;trings into the fire. If they crackle, and &s;hrink up, as they always do, it is taken, for a certain &s;ign, that the &s;pirit of the bear is appea&s;ed.</P>
<P>The hunters make good cheer, as long as the chace la&s;ts. To &s;ee how they are received, the prai&s;es be|&s;towed upon them, the plea&s;ed, and &s;elf-&s;ufficient airs they take upon them&s;elves; one would &s;ay, they were returning from &s;ome grand expedition, loaded with the &s;poils of a whole nation de&s;troyed.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="205">I have already &s;poke largely of the bears in Lapland; but, I cannot pa&s;s over what <HI>Charlevoix</HI> &s;ays of the bears in Canada. He a&s;&s;erts, that, wherever the bears retreat in winter, whether to a hollow tree, or a cavern, they make no provi&s;ion there, nor do they quit their retreat for &s;ix months; that, in fact, a bear never eats for the &s;pace of &s;uch a winter: they have been kept chained for &s;ix months together, in the winter-&s;ea&s;on, and without food; and yet, have been fat, and clothed with a good fur; whereas, in July, which is in rutting time, they grow very lean, the effect merely of jealou&s;y; but, when this &s;ea&s;on is pa&s;&s;ed, the bear grows fat again. A bear's whelp is as good eating as a lamb. The dogs they hunt with, are &s;haped like a wolf, with upright ears, and a long no&s;e.&mdash;I will now &s;peak of the Original.</P>
<P>The original of this country is an animal, which, in Germany, Poland, and Ru&s;&s;ia, is called the elk, or great-bea&s;t. It equals a hor&s;e in &s;ize. The hind|quarters are large, the tail but one inch long, the horns very high, the legs and feet like tho&s;e of a hart; a long hair covers the withers, the neck, and upper part of the hams. The head is about two feet long, and he carries it out, which gives him an ill-look. The muzzle is large, and le&s;&s;ens in the upper part, like that of a camel, and its no&s;trils are &s;o large, that one may ea&s;ily thru&s;t in half one's arm. Its horns are not le&s;s long than tho&s;e of a hart, and much wider; they are flat, and forked
<PB N="196" REF="206">
like tho&s;e of a deer, and are renewed every year. The hair of the original, is a mixture of light grey, and dark red. It grows hollow as the bea&s;t grows old, and never lo&s;es its ela&s;tic power. Beat it ever &s;o long, it &s;prings up again. Matra&s;&s;es are made of it, and &s;addles. Its &s;kin is &s;trong, &s;oft, and &s;ub&s;tantial, and is made into &s;hamois, and excellent buff.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t northern nations of Canada, take this animal very ea&s;ily, and without danger. The hunters divide them&s;elves into two companies, one embarks in canoes; and the&s;e, keeping at &s;ome di&s;tance from each other, form a large &s;emi-circle, the two ends of which touch the &s;hore. The other company, on land, perform much the &s;ame operation, and enclo&s;e a large &s;pace. Then the&s;e hunters let go their dogs, and rou&s;e all the originals that are within that &s;pace, and driving them forward, oblige them to run into the water, where they are fired on from all the canoes.</P>
<P>This animal has another enemy, namely, the carcajou; a &s;ort of wild cat, with a tail &s;o long, that it can twi&s;t it &s;everal times round its body. When it comes up with an original, it leaps upon him; and, fixing on his neck, twi&s;ts its long tail round it, then tears out the jugular vein, and thus de&s;troys him.</P>
<P>There being a great difference between the beavers of Europe, and tho&s;e of Canada, I mu&s;t not omit this
<PB N="197" REF="207">
opportunity of &s;peaking of them. The &s;poils of this animal, has furni&s;hed this part of the world with the principal object of his trade. It is, of it&s;elf, one of the wonders of nature; and, it may be, to man, a great example of fore&s;ight, of indu&s;try, &s;kill, and con&s;tancy in labour.</P>
<P>The beaver, or ca&s;tor, is the &s;ame creature. It de|rived its latter name from an idea, that, when pur&s;ued by the hunters for its te&s;ticles, rather than lo&s;e its life, it will bite them off, and ca&s;t them from him. But this is an idle &s;tory; the mo&s;t valuable part of the beaver is its fur, of which gloves and &s;tockings are made, being &s;oft and warm.</P>
<P>The beaver of Canada is an amphibious quadruped, which cannot remain long in water, and yet can do without being in it, provided it has the opportunity of wa&s;hing it&s;elf occa&s;ionally. The large&s;t beaver is &s;omething under four feet long, about 15 inches from one hip to another, and weighs about 60 pounds. Its colour varies, according to the different climates where it is found. In the mo&s;t di&s;tant parts of the north, they are commonly quite black; though &s;ometimes they are found there white. In the more temperate countries they are brown, and, by degrees, as they advance towards the &s;outh, their colour grows more and more light. Among the Illinois they are almo&s;t of a &s;allow colour, and &s;ome have been found of a &s;traw-colour. It is further ob|&s;erved,
<PB N="198" REF="208">
that the le&s;s black they are, the le&s;s fur they have, and of cour&s;e, their &s;kins are le&s;s valuable.</P>
<P>The ca&s;tor, or ca&s;toreum, &s;o much &s;ought after by the druggi&s;ts, are four pur&s;es, or bags, in the lower belly of the beaver (not its te&s;ticles). They contain a &s;oft, re&s;inous, gluey matter, mixt with &s;mall fibres; of a &s;trong &s;mell, and ea&s;ily inflammable. The beaver-fur is too &s;hort to be &s;pun, and is fit only to mix with rabbit-wool, to make hats of. If, then, there is any thing to admire in the beaver, it is that its indu&s;try, its fore&s;ight; their unity, and &s;ubordination among them&s;elves, their attention to procure conveniences, the comfort of which brutes were formerly thought in&s;en&s;ible of, furni&s;h man with more in&s;truction than the ant, to which the Holy Scriptures &s;end the idle. They are, at lea&s;t, among the quadrupeds, what the bees are among&s;t flying in&s;ects. They have neither a king nor queen to govern them; but, by virtue of that in&s;tinct given to animals, by Him who&s;e providence directs them, every one knows what he has to do, and every thing is done without confu&s;ion, and with &s;o much order, as cannot be &s;ufficiently ad|mired. Perhaps, after all, we are &s;o much a&s;toni&s;hed, only, for want of looking up to that &s;upreme Intelligence, who makes u&s;e of tho&s;e beings who want rea&s;on, the better to di&s;play his wi&s;dom and power; and to teach us, that our rea&s;on it&s;elf is, frequently, by our pre&s;ump|tion, the cau&s;e of our going a&s;tray.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="209">The fir&s;t thing done by the&s;e creatures, when they want to make a habitation, is to a&s;&s;emble them&s;elves, three or four hundred together, in order to build a little city of Venice, in the mid&s;t of water. They fir&s;t chu&s;e a place where they may find plenty of provi&s;ions, and materials for building; but, above all, they mu&s;t have water. If there is no lake or pond near, they &s;upply the defect, by &s;topping the cour&s;e of &s;ome brook, by a dyke, or cau&s;ey. For this purpo&s;e they cut &s;ome trees, above the place where they intend to build. Three or four beavers &s;et them&s;elves about a great tree, and will &s;oon cut it down with their teeth. This is not all; they contrive it &s;o well, that it always falls on the &s;ide next the water, that they may have le&s;s di&s;tance to carry it when they cut it to pieces; &s;en&s;ible their materials are not &s;o ea&s;ily conveyed by land, as by water. They have nothing after to do, but to roll the&s;e pieces into the water, and guide them to the place where they are to be fixed. The&s;e pieces are thicker or thinner, longer or &s;horter, as the nature and &s;ituation of the place require; for one may &s;ay, the&s;e architects conceive, at once, every thing that relates to their de&s;ign. Sometimes they em|ploy large trunks of trees, which they lay flat. Some|times the dam, or cau&s;ey, as it is called here, is made only of &s;takes; &s;ome as thick as a man's thigh, or le&s;s, which they drive into the earth, very near each other, and interweave with &s;mall branches, and, every where, fill up the hollow &s;paces with clay, &s;o well applied, that not a drop of water can pa&s;s through; and their tail,
<PB N="200" REF="210">
which is four or five inches broad, &s;erves them, not only for a trowel to build with, but for a hod to carry their mortar. To place and &s;pread the clay, they fir&s;t u&s;e their paws, then their tail. The foundation of the dams are generally 10 or 12 feet thick; but they decrea&s;e in thickne&s;s upwards, &s;o as to be not more than two feet thick at top. All this is done in exact proportion; for, it is ob&s;erved, that the &s;ide towards the current of the water is always &s;loping, &s;o as to break the pre&s;&s;ure of the water, and the other &s;ide is perpendicular. In &s;hort, it would be difficult for our be&s;t workmen to make any thing more compact or regular. The con&s;truction of their cabins is not le&s;s wonderful. They are generally erected on piles, in the mid&s;t of the&s;e little lakes, which the dykes have made; &s;ometimes, by the &s;ide of a river, or at the extremity of a point, that advances into the water. Their &s;hape is round, or oval, and their roofs arched. The walls are two feet thick, formed like the cau&s;ey, and every where &s;o well pla&s;tered with clay within, that no air can enter. Two-thirds of the build|ing is out of the water, and in this part every beaver has a &s;eparate place, which he &s;trews with leaves, or &s;mall branches of fir. It is always free from ordure; and, for this end, be&s;ides the common door of the cabin, and another outlet, by which the&s;e creatures pa&s;s to bathe them&s;elves, there are &s;everal openings, by which they can dung into the water. The common cabins lodge eight or 10 beavers; but &s;ome have been found which
<PB N="201" REF="211">
held thirty. They are all near enough each other to have a communication.</P>
<P>The&s;e animals are never &s;urpri&s;ed by the winter. Their buildings are completed by the end of September; and then every one provides his &s;tock for the winter. Whil&s;t they go to and fro in the woods and fields, they live on fruits, and the bark and leaves of trees, cray-fi&s;h, and other fi&s;h; but when they are to provide for the winter, they content them&s;elves with &s;oft woods, &s;uch as the poplar and a&s;pen. They pile it up in &s;uch a manner, that they can always take tho&s;e pieces which are &s;oaked in water; and the&s;e piles are larger or &s;maller, as the winter will prove, longer or &s;horter; which is as an al|manack to the &s;avages, which never deceives them, in regard to the cold. When the melting of the &s;now cau&s;es floods, and drowns their habitations, they quit them till the month of July, and then return to repair them; and, if they find they have been de&s;troyed by hunters, they make others. There are a variety of &s;tories re&s;pecting the &s;agacity of this animal; but, as I am not writing a natural hi&s;tory, I mu&s;t refer my readers to <HI>Buffon,</HI> and others, who have written largely on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>But of all the numerous tribes of quadrupeds in this exten&s;ive country, the buffalo merits a de&s;cription; not only on account of its being the mo&s;t numerous, but, likewi&s;e, for the utility every part of it is convertable to.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="212">The Indians have various methods of killing the buffalo; one of which is, by cautiou&s;ly approaching them when feeding: the hunter, upon this occa&s;ion, lies upon his belly, and will, &s;ometimes, fire his gun 40 or 50 times, without rai&s;ing his head. They al&s;o pur&s;ue them on hor&s;eback, and &s;hoot them with arrows and guns; the general mode of taking them, is by a pound, con&s;tructed in the following manner:</P>
<P>They are either of a circular, or a &s;quare form, and differ, according to the manner of the nation by whom they are made. The &s;quare ones, about Hud&s;on's-Bay, are compo&s;ed of trees, laid one upon another, to the height of about five feet, each &s;quare &s;ide about 50 feet long. On that &s;ide on which the animals are to enter, a bank of earth is rai&s;ed, five feet high, with an ea&s;y a&s;cent to the top, &s;o as to be on a level with the top of the enclo&s;ure, or the other &s;ide of the &s;quare. This done, a number of branches of trees are placed from each &s;ide of the front, in a &s;traight line, from the rai&s;ed hill, to the di&s;tance of 100 feet, the lines &s;preading continually from each other, &s;o as to be 200 feet apart, at the di&s;tance of 100 feet from the pound. The&s;e lines of trees are lengthened out, by a number of poles, 15 feet long, erected at 12 feet di&s;tance from each other, with a piece of buffalo dung on the top of each. At the foot of each pole, a man lies concealed, in a buffalo-&s;kin, to keep the animals in a &s;traight direction to the pound. The&s;e poles are al&s;o placed alike on each &s;ide, always in|crea&s;ing

in breadth from &s;ide to &s;ide. Every prepara|tion being now made, three or four men &s;et off on foot, to find a herd of cows, for bulls they con&s;ider of little value. The&s;e they drive ea&s;ily along, till they arrive in the neighbourhood of the pound, when one man is di&s;|patched to give notice to the other Indians, who imme|diately a&s;&s;emble on hor&s;eback, on each &s;ide the herd, keep|ing a proper di&s;tance, &s;o as not to frighten the animals. Thus are they conducted within the poles; &s;hould they at|tempt to run out between them, the men, who are placed at the foot of each pole, &s;hake their &s;kins, which drives the herd to the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, where the other men do the &s;ame; &s;o that, at la&s;t, they are driven up the bank, into the pound, where falling in headlong, one upon another, &s;ome break their necks, &s;ome their backs, and &s;ome their legs; and the confu&s;ion becomes &s;o great within, that though the height of the &s;ides, &s;hall not exceed five feet, none will make their e&s;cape.</P>
<P>Having mentioned hor&s;es, it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay, that tho&s;e bred here are variou&s;ly coloured, as our Engli&s;h hor&s;es are, but as &s;mall as tho&s;e found in the north of Scotland. They were originally imported by the Spa|niards, on the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the continent, and it is but lately that they have become common among the Nehe|thawa Indians, who much e&s;teem them, and &s;hew more affection for them, than they do for their wives. Many broils and animo&s;ities among the natives, originate from a de&s;ire of being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e animals. One
<PB N="204" REF="215">
party generally commences ho&s;tilities, by &s;tealing the hor&s;es of their adver&s;aries; and they, in return, retaliate; &s;o that, at length, a mutual re&s;entment takes place, and war becomes ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The method of travelling and hunting in the &s;now, in this country, is not unlike the manner made u&s;e of in Lapland, and other northern countries, a kind of &s;now &s;hoes, or &s;cates. They are here called racquets, are about three feet long, and, in their greate&s;t breadth, 15 or 16 inches wide. The&s;e are bound to the feet with thongs, and they &s;cud over the &s;now with them very fa&s;t. Their baggage they draw on &s;ledges.</P>
<P>In many nations of the Algonquin language, a plurality of wives is e&s;tabli&s;hed, and it is common enough for a man to marry all the &s;i&s;ters; a cu&s;tom founded on the notion they have, that &s;i&s;ters will agree together better than &s;trangers. In this ca&s;e, all the wives are upon an equal footing; but, among the true Algonquins, they have two &s;orts of wives, and the &s;econd are &s;laves to the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>The Hurons, and Irroquois, are very &s;crupulous with re&s;pect to marriage. Among them, there mu&s;t be no manner of relation between the parties to be married; and even adoption is comprehended in this law. But the hu&s;band, if the wife dies fir&s;t, mu&s;t marry her &s;i&s;ter, or, in default of &s;uch, the woman which his wife's family
<PB N="205" REF="216">
&s;hall chu&s;e for him. The rea&s;on they give for it is the &s;ame. But it is mentioned, Deut. 25. v. 6. A hu&s;band who &s;hould for&s;ake his wife, without a lawful cau&s;e, mu&s;t expect many in&s;ults from her relations; and a woman who &s;hould leave her hu&s;band, without being forced to it, by his ill-treatment, would pa&s;s her time &s;till wor&s;e.</P>
<P>Among the Miemis, the hu&s;band has a right to cut off his wife's no&s;e, if &s;he runs away from him; but, among the Irroquois and the Hurons, they may part by con&s;ent. This is done without noi&s;e; and the parties, thus &s;epa|rated, may marry again.</P>
<P>Treaties of marriage, are entirely carried on by the parents; but, the con&s;ent of the young couple is al|ways a&s;ked. In &s;ome places, the women are in no ha&s;te to be married; becau&s;e they are allowed to make what trials of it they plea&s;e, and the ceremony of marriage only changes their condition for the wor&s;e. In general there is great mode&s;ty in the young folks, whil&s;t their marriage is in negociation; but, they &s;ay, it was quite otherwi&s;e formerly. But, what is mo&s;t incredible, and yet well-atte&s;ted, is, that, in many places, the new-married couple are together a whole year, living in perfect con|tinence, to &s;hew that they are married for friend&s;hip, and not to gratify a &s;en&s;ual pa&s;&s;ion. A young woman would be even pointed at, that &s;hould happen to be with child the fir&s;t year after her marriage. After this,
<PB N="206" REF="217">
it will be ea&s;ier to believe what is &s;aid of the young people's behaviour during their court&s;hip, in the places where they are allowed to &s;ee one another in private; for though cu&s;tom admits them to have very private meetings; yet, in the greate&s;t danger that cha&s;tity can be expo&s;ed to, and even under the veil of night, they &s;ay, nothing pa&s;&s;es again&s;t the rules of the utmo&s;t de|corum; and, that not even a word is &s;poken that can give the lea&s;t offence to mode&s;ty.</P>
<P>During the preliminaries of marriage, the young man is contented to go and &s;it by the &s;ide of the young woman, in her cabin; and, if &s;he &s;uffers it, and continues in her place, it is taken for con&s;ent, and the marriage is con|cluded. But, in the mid&s;t of all this deference and re|&s;pect, he gives &s;ome tokens that he will be &s;oon ma&s;ter; for, among the pre&s;ents he makes her, there are &s;ome which ought le&s;s to be regarded as marks of friend&s;hip, than as &s;ymbols and notices of the &s;lavery to which &s;he is going to be reduced. Such are the collar, a long and broad band of leather, which &s;erves to draw loads, the kettle, and a billet. This is to let her know, that &s;he is to carry burdens, dre&s;s provi&s;ions, and get wood for firing.</P>
<P>The women, in general, are brought to bed without any pain, and without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but, there are &s;ome, who are a long time in labour, and &s;uffer much. When this happens, they give notice of it to the young
<PB N="207" REF="218">
people; who, all on a &s;udden, and when the patient lea&s;t expects it, come and make great noi&s;es at the door of the cabin, the &s;urpri&s;e of which has &s;uch an effect upon her, as in&s;tantly to procure her delivery. The women never lie-in, in their own cabins; many are taken &s;uddenly, and bring forth their children, whil&s;t at work, or on a journey. For others, when they find them&s;elves near their time, they make a little hut with|out the village, where they remain 40 days after delivery. The time being expired, they extingui&s;h all the fires of the cabin, to which &s;he is to return, &s;hake all the clothes, and, at her return, light a new fire. The &s;ame formali|ties are pretty nearly ob&s;erved with re&s;pect to all the &s;ex, in the time of their terms; and not only whil&s;t the&s;e la&s;t, but al&s;o whil&s;t a woman is with child, or gives &s;uck, (and they commonly &s;uckle their children three years,) the hu&s;band never approaches them. Nothing would be more prai&s;e worthy than this cu&s;tom, if both parties pre|&s;erved the fidelity they owe to each other; but there is often a failure on one &s;ide or the other: and &s;uch is the cor|ruption of the human heart, that the wi&s;e&s;t regulations often produce the greate&s;t di&s;orders. It is even &s;aid, that the u&s;e of certain &s;imples, which have a power to prevent the con&s;equences of the womens' infidelity, is pretty common in this country.</P>
<P>A mother's care to her child, whil&s;t in its cradle, is, as I have ob&s;erved, uncommon; but the child is no &s;ooner out of it, than it is left to it&s;elf, not through
<PB N="208" REF="219">
want of affection, for that is never lo&s;t whil&s;t they live; but, from a per&s;ua&s;ion, it is be&s;t to leave nature to her&s;elf, and without any re&s;traint. The act which ter|minates the fir&s;t &s;tage of infancy, is giving a name, which, among the&s;e people, is an affair of importance.</P>
<P>This ceremony is performed at a fea&s;t, where no per|&s;ons are pre&s;ent, but of the &s;ame &s;ex with the child that is to be named. Whil&s;t they are eating, the child is on its father or mother's knees, who continually re|commend it to its guardian genius. New names are never invented. Each family has a certain number, which they take by turns.</P>
<P>When they talk to a man in common di&s;cour&s;e, they never call him by his proper name; this would be im|polite, but give him the quality he has with re&s;pect to the per&s;on that &s;peaks to him; where there is no relation, indeed, or affinity between them, they u&s;e the term of brother, uncle, nephew, or cou&s;in, according to each other's age, or according to the value they have for the per&s;on they addre&s;s.</P>
<P>There are few men in the world, that have le&s;s need of phy&s;ic. They are not only almo&s;t all of a healthy and &s;trong con&s;titution, but they never knew the greate&s;t part of European di&s;tempers, till we came among them. The gout, gravel, &s;tone, apoplexy, and many other di&s;ea&s;es, &s;o common in Europe, have not yet reached
<PB N="209" REF="220">
this part of the new world, among the natural inhabi|tants of the country. If they are at any time ill, they apply to their jugglers, who&s;e chief employment is that of phy&s;ic.</P>
<P>They &s;eldom con&s;ider a di&s;ea&s;e as merely natural, or, among the common remedies they u&s;e, allow any to have, in them&s;elves, the virtue of healing. The great u&s;e they make of their &s;imples, is for wounds, fractures, di&s;locations, and ruptures. They blame the great in|ci&s;ions our &s;urgeons make, to clean&s;e wounds. They &s;queeze out the juice of many plants, and, with this extract, draw out all the corruption, and even the &s;plinters of broken bones, &s;tones, iron, and, in general, all foreign matter that remains in the wounded part. The&s;e &s;ame juices are all the food the patient has, till the wound is clo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Whatever their knowledge may be, it is certain, they have very quick and &s;overeign remedies again&s;t the pal&s;y, drop&s;y, and venereal di&s;ea&s;e. In the la&s;t two, a decoction of the &s;havings of guiacum wood, and &s;a&s;&s;a|fras, are their common &s;pecifics. And they have a me|thod of uniting a broken bone, and making it &s;olid, in eight days.</P>
<P>In acute di&s;ea&s;es, as in the pleuri&s;y, they apply cata|pla&s;ms to the &s;ide, oppo&s;ite the pain, which draw, and prevent the humours from &s;ettling. But their great
<PB N="210" REF="221">
remedy, and pre&s;ervative again&s;t all di&s;ea&s;es, is &s;weat|ing. On coming out of a &s;weating-hou&s;e, whil&s;t the &s;weat runs down all parts of their bodies, they will plunge them&s;elves, as do the Ru&s;&s;ians, into a river; or if no water is near them, they will get &s;ome per&s;on to throw the colde&s;t water over them. They frequently &s;weat them&s;elves merely to recover the fatigue of a journey, to calm their &s;pirits, and enable them to conver&s;e the better. As &s;oon as a &s;tranger comes into a cabin, they make a fire for him, rub his feet with oil, and then conduct him to a &s;tove, where his ho&s;t keeps him company.</P>
<P>When a &s;ick man refu&s;es all &s;orts of food, they &s;up|po&s;e him ill indeed: in this ca&s;e, they advi&s;e with a juggler; who, at be&s;t, is no better than a quack, and the&s;e men have a &s;ingular method of not being an&s;wer|able for events. As &s;oon as they perceive a patient has the &s;ymptoms of death, they never fail to pre&s;cribe things too difficult to be put into execution; &s;o that they are a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ys &s;ure of an excu&s;e, on account of their orders not having been punctually followed. It is not to be con|ceived to what extravagancies they go on the&s;e occa|&s;ions: They will order &s;ome patients to counterfeit them&s;elves mad. In &s;ome di&s;ea&s;es they order dances, which are generally very la&s;civious. One would think, they aimed more to ha&s;ten the patient's death, than his cure; but, what &s;hews the force of imagination
<PB N="211" REF="222">
is, that the&s;e doctors, with all their follies, perform as many cures as ours do.</P>
<P>In &s;ome &s;avage nations of America, when the di&s;|temper is de&s;perate, they kill the patient, to put him out of his pain. In the Canton of Onnontague, they de|&s;troy young children, that lo&s;e their mothers at their birth, or bury them alive with them, from a per&s;ua|&s;ion, that another woman cannot nur&s;e them, and that they would pine to death. But this barbarous cu&s;tom has been lately laid a&s;ide. Some mothers for&s;ake the di&s;|ea&s;ed, when the doctors give them over, and let them die with hunger and thir&s;t. And there are &s;ome, who, to hinder the di&s;tortion of the features, in dying per&s;ons, clo&s;e their eyes and mouth, when they &s;ee them in the agony of death.</P>
<P>In Nova Scotia, the jugglers are called <HI>aulmoins,</HI> and it is generally the chief of the village, who is inve&s;ted with this dignity; of cour&s;e, though they have not much &s;kill, nor le&s;s impo&s;ture, they have more authority. When called to a patient, the fir&s;t thing they do is, to view him attentively for &s;ome time, and then to blow upon him. If this has no effect, the rea&s;on is, "That the devil is in him, and mu&s;t come out: yet, let every one be upon his guard; for this evil &s;pirit, out of &s;pite, may fall upon one of the company." Then they enter in to a kind of phrenzy, make &s;trange po&s;tures, cry out,
<PB N="212" REF="223">
threaten the pretended devil, &s;peak to him as if they had &s;een him, and make pa&s;&s;es at him.</P>
<P>When they enter the cabin, they always have the pre|caution, to thru&s;t into the earth a piece of wood, fa&s;tened to a &s;tring; then, offer the end of the &s;tring to all the company pre&s;ent, de&s;iring them to pull up this piece of wood; and as none can &s;carce ever accompli&s;h it, they tell them, it is the devil that holds it; then feigning to &s;tab this pretended devil, they loo&s;en the wood, by little, and little, by digging the earth round it, after which, it is drawn up with ea&s;e, and all pre&s;ent cry out, "Victory!" To this piece of wood is fa&s;tened, under it, a little bone, or &s;ome &s;uch thing, which they &s;hew to the people pre&s;ent, &s;aying, that was the cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, it was nece&s;&s;ary to kill the devil to get at it.</P>
<P>This farce la&s;ts generally four or five hours, at the end of which the doctor wants re&s;t and refre&s;hment. He goes away, a&s;&s;uring the patient, that he will recover, if the di&s;temper has not got the upper hand; that is to &s;ay, if the devil, before his retreat, has not already given him a mortal wound. But how is the doctor to know this? He pretends to know it by dreams; but takes &s;pecial care, not to &s;peak plainly, till he &s;ees what turn the di&s;temper is likely to take. When he judges it in|curable, he retires; and, after his example, every one for&s;akes the &s;ick per&s;on. If, after three days, he is &s;till
<PB N="213" REF="224">
alive, "The devil," &s;ays the doctor, "is re&s;olved he &s;hall recover, and will not let him die. We mu&s;t, out of charity, put an end to his &s;ufferings." Immediately his deare&s;t friends fetch cold water, and pour it on his face, till he expires. The delu&s;ion is &s;uch, that many thanks are given to the doctor, with a con&s;iderable reward.</P>
<P>Some nations of the &s;outh have maxims quite the rever&s;e. They never pay the doctor till after the cure. If the patient dies, the doctor's life is in danger. Accord|ing to the Irroquois, every di&s;temper is a de&s;ire of the &s;oul, and death is the con&s;equence of not accompli&s;hing the de&s;ire.</P>
<P>In general, when they think them&s;elves pa&s;t recovery, they meet their fate with a re&s;olution truly &s;toical, and they often &s;ee their days &s;hortened, by the per&s;ons that are mo&s;t dear to them, without &s;hewing the lea&s;t chagrin. The declaration of the doctor's &s;entence, is &s;carcely fini&s;hed to a dying man, before he makes an effort to harrangue tho&s;e that are about him. If it is the chief of a family, he fir&s;t makes his funeral oration, which he fini&s;hes, by giving very good coun&s;el to his children. After this, he takes leave of every one, gives orders for a fea&s;t, in which they mu&s;t u&s;e all the provi&s;ions that remain in the cabin, and then he receives the pre&s;ents of his family.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="225">During this time, they cut the throats of all the dogs they can catch, that the &s;ouls of the&s;e animals may go into the other world, and give notice, that &s;uch a per&s;on will arrive there &s;oon. The fea&s;t being over, they begin to weep, but their tears are interrupted, to bid the dying per&s;on farewel, and wi&s;h him a good journey; to com|fort him on his &s;eparation from his friends and relations; and to a&s;&s;ure him, that his children will maintain all the glory which he has acquired.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e people &s;hew &s;o little judge|ment in their manner of treating the &s;ick, they be|have towards the dead, with a genero&s;ity and affection that cannot be too much admired. Some mothers have been known to have kept the dead bodies of their chil|dren whole years, and would never go from them; others draw milk from their brea&s;ts, and pour it on the tombs of the&s;e little creatures. If a village happens to take fire, in which there are any dead bodies, this is the fir&s;t thing they take care to pre&s;erve. They &s;trip them|&s;elves of every thing that is mo&s;t valuable, to adorn the dead. From time to time, they open their coffins, to change their dre&s;s; and they deprive them&s;elves of food to carry it to their &s;epulchres, and to the places where they fancy their &s;ouls walk. In a word, they are at much greater expence for the dead, than the living.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="226">As &s;oon as the &s;ick per&s;on expires, the place is filled with mournful cries, which la&s;t as long as the family is able to defray the expences; for they mu&s;t keep open table all this time. The dead body, dre&s;&s;ed in the fine&s;t robe, with the face painted, the arms, and all that belongs to the decea&s;ed, by his &s;ide, is expo&s;ed, at the cabin door, in the po&s;ture it is to be laid in the tomb; and this po&s;ture is the &s;ame, in many places, as that of the child in its mother's womb. The cu&s;tom of &s;ome nations is, for the relations of the decea&s;ed to fa&s;t to the end of the funeral; and all this interval is pa&s;&s;ed in tears and cries, in treating their vi&s;itors, in prai&s;ing the dead, and in mutual compliments. In other places they hire women to weep. They &s;ing, they dance, they weep, without cea&s;ing, always keeping time: but the&s;e demon&s;trations of a borrowed &s;orrow, do not prevent the effects of nature, from the relations of the dead.</P>
<P>They carry the body to its place of interment, with|out much ceremony; but take care to cover it in its grave, &s;o that the earth &s;hall not touch it. It lies as in a little cave, lined with &s;kin, much richer, and better adorned, than their cabins. A po&s;t is then &s;et up on the grave, and a number of things hung on it, that may &s;hew the e&s;teem they had for the decea&s;ed. They &s;ome|times put on it his portrait, and every thing that may &s;erve to &s;hew to pa&s;&s;engers, who he was, and the fine&s;t actions of his life. They carry fre&s;h provi&s;ions to the
<PB N="216" REF="227">
grave every morning; and as the dogs, and other bea&s;ts, do not fail to reap the benefit of it, they are willing to per&s;uade them&s;elves, that the&s;e things have been eaten by the &s;ouls of the decea&s;ed.</P>
<P>When any one dies in hunting, they expo&s;e his body on a very high &s;caffold, and it remains there till the departure of the troop, who carry it with them to the village. The bodies of tho&s;e who die in war are burnt, and their a&s;hes brought back, to be laid in the burial-place of their fathers. The&s;e burial-places, among the mo&s;t &s;ettled nations, are places like our church-yards, near the village. Others bury their dead in the woods, at the foot of a tree, or dry them, and keep them in che&s;ts, till the fe&s;tival of the dead, which I &s;hall pre|&s;ently de&s;cribe. But, in &s;ome places, they ob&s;erve an odd ceremony, for tho&s;e that are drowned, or are frozen to death.</P>
<P>Before I relate it, it will be proper to &s;ay, that they believe, when the&s;e accidents happen, that the &s;pirits are incen&s;ed, and that their anger is not appea&s;ed till the body is found. Then, the preliminaries of tears, dances, &s;ongs, and fea&s;ts being ended, they carry the body to the u&s;ual place of interment, or, if it be too far off, to the place where it is to remain, till the fe&s;tival of the dead. There they dig a very large pit, and make a fire in it; then &s;ome young per&s;ons approach the corp&s;e, cut cut the fle&s;h, in parts marked out by a ma&s;ter of
<PB N="217" REF="228">
the ceremonies, and throw them into the fire, with the bowels. The corp&s;e, thus mangled, is put into the place de&s;tined for it. During this operation, the female relations of the decea&s;ed, go continually round tho&s;e that are at it, exhorting them to acquit them&s;elves well in what they have undertaken, and put beads of porcelain in their mouth, as we would give &s;ugar-plumbs to chil|dren, to entice them to do what we de&s;ire.</P>
<P>The interment is followed by pre&s;ents, which they make to the afflicted family, and this they call, cover|ing of the dead. Allies, al&s;o, make &s;ome pre&s;ents at the death of con&s;iderable per&s;ons; but, fir&s;t, the family of the decea&s;ed, make a great fea&s;t in his name; and this fea&s;t is accompanied with games, for which they pro|po&s;e prizes, which are performed in this manner. A chief throws on the tomb three &s;ticks, about a foot long. A young man; a woman, and a maiden, take each of them one, and tho&s;e of their ages, their &s;ex, and con|dition, &s;trive to wre&s;t them out of their hands. Tho&s;e with whom the &s;ticks remain, are conquerors. There are al&s;o races; and they &s;ometimes &s;hoot at a mark. In &s;hort, by a cu&s;tom, which we find e&s;tabli&s;hed in all the times of Pagan antiquity, a ceremony, entirely mourn|ful, is terminated by &s;ongs, and &s;houts of victory.</P>
<P>It is true, that the family of the decea&s;ed bear no part in the&s;e rejoicings. They ob&s;erve, even in his cabin, after the ob&s;equies, a mourning, the laws of which are
<PB N="218" REF="229">
very &s;evere. They mu&s;t have their hair cut off, and their faces blacked. They mu&s;t &s;tand, with their heads wrapt in a blanket. They mu&s;t not look at any per&s;on, nor make any vi&s;it, nor eat any thing hot. They mu&s;t deprive them&s;elves of all plea&s;ures, wear &s;carce any thing on their bodies, and never warm them&s;elves at the fire, even in the depth of winter.</P>
<P>After this deep mourning, which la&s;ts two years, they begin a &s;econd, more moderate, which continues two or three years longer, and which may be &s;oftened, by little and little; but they di&s;pen&s;e with nothing that is pre|&s;cribed, without the con&s;ent of the people of the cabin, to which the widower, or the widow belongs. The&s;e permi&s;&s;ions, as well as the end of the mourning, always co&s;ts the neare&s;t relation a fea&s;t.</P>
<P>On the death of a wife, the hu&s;band does not weep; becau&s;e, according to their ideas, tears do not become men; but this is not general among all the Sioux na|tions. Women weep for their hu&s;bands a year. They call him without cea&s;ing, and fill the village with cries and lamentations; e&s;pecially at &s;un-ri&s;e, noon, and &s;un|&s;et; and, in &s;ome places, when they go out to work, and when they return. Mothers do much the &s;ame for their children.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t, and often the only compliment, they pay to a friend, and even to a &s;tranger, they receive in their
<PB N="219" REF="230">
cabins, is to weep for the neare&s;t relations he has lo&s;t &s;ince they la&s;t &s;aw him. They put their hands on his head, and give him to under&s;tand who it is they weep for, without mentioning his name. All this is founded on nature, and has nothing &s;avage in it. But what I am going to relate, does not appear to be any way excu&s;e|able, that is, the behaviour of the&s;e people towards tho&s;e who die a violent death, even though it be in war, and the &s;ervice of their country.</P>
<P>They have a notion, that their &s;ouls, in the other world, have no communication with the &s;ouls of men who die a natural death; and, on this principle, burn them directly, &s;ometimes even before they expire. They never inter them in the common burying-place, and give them no part in the great ceremony, which is re|newed every eight years among &s;ome nations, and every ten years among the Hurons, and the Irroquois.</P>
<P>They call it, "The Fe&s;tival of the Dead," or, "The Fea&s;t of Souls;" and is the mo&s;t &s;ingular ceremony, and the mo&s;t celebrated of the religion of the &s;avages. A place being fixed for the a&s;&s;embly to meet in, they elect a king of the fea&s;t, who&s;e duty it is to order every thing, and to invite the neighbouring villages. The day appointed being come, all the &s;avages a&s;&s;emble, and go in proce&s;&s;ion, two and two, to the burying-place. There every one labours to uncover the bodies; which done, they continue contemplating, in &s;ilence, on a
<PB N="220" REF="231">
&s;pectacle, &s;o capable of exciting the mo&s;t &s;erious re|flexions. The women fir&s;t interrupt this religious &s;ilence, by &s;ending forth mournful cries, which encrea&s;e the horror with which every one is filled.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t act being ended, they take up the carca&s;es, pick up the dry and &s;eparated bones, and put them in parcels, and tho&s;e who are ordered to carry them, take them on their &s;houlders. If there are any bodies not entirely decayed, they wa&s;h them, clean away the cor|rupted fle&s;h, and all the filth, and wrap them in new robes of beaver-&s;kins. They then return in the &s;ame order they came; and, when the proce&s;&s;ion reaches the village, every one lays in his cabin the burden he was charged with; during the march the women continue their lamen|tations, and the men &s;hew the &s;ame &s;igns of grief they did on the day of the death of tho&s;e who&s;e remains they have been taking up. And this &s;econd act is followed by a fea&s;t, in each cabin, in honour of the dead of each family.</P>
<P>The following days they make public fea&s;ts, accom|panied as on the day of the funeral, with dances, games, and combats, for which there are certain prizes. From time to time, during the&s;e gambols, they make loud outcries, which they call the "Cries of the Souls." They make pre&s;ents to &s;trangers; &s;ome of whom come 150 leagues to the ceremony. They al&s;o take advan|tage of this general meeting, to treat of common af|fairs,
<PB N="221" REF="232">
or of the election of a chief. Every thing pa&s;&s;es with a great deal of order, decency, and mode&s;ty, and every one appears to entertain &s;entiments &s;uitable to the principal action. Every thing, even in the dances and &s;ongs, carries an air of &s;adne&s;s and mourning; and one can &s;ee, in them, all hearts pierced with the &s;harpe&s;t &s;orrow. The mo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible would be affected at the &s;ight of &s;uch a &s;pectacle. After &s;ome days are pa&s;t, they go again in proce&s;&s;ion to a great council-room, built for the purpo&s;e; and all the&s;e marches and proce&s;&s;ions are made to the &s;ound of their in&s;truments, accompanied with their be&s;t voices, and all marching in time to the mu&s;ic. When they reach the council-room, they hang up the bones and carca&s;&s;es again&s;t the wall, in the &s;ame condition they took them from the burying-place, and there lay forth the pre&s;ents de&s;igned for the dead. If among the&s;e &s;ad remains, there happens to be tho&s;e of a chief, his &s;ucce&s;&s;or gives a great fea&s;t in his name, and &s;ings his &s;ong. In many places, the bones are carried from village to village, are received every where with great demon&s;trations of grief and tenderne&s;s, and every where they make them pre&s;ents; and, la&s;tly, they carry them to the place where they are always to remain.</P>
<P>This la&s;t, and common burial-place, is a great pit, lined with their fine&s;t furs, and the be&s;t things they have. The pre&s;ents de&s;igned for the dead, are placed by them|&s;elves. By degrees, as the proce&s;&s;ion arrives, each
<PB N="222" REF="233">
family ranges on a kind of &s;caffold, &s;et up round the pit, and the moment the bones are laid in, the women re|new their lamentations. Then, all pre&s;ent de&s;cend into the pit, and every one takes a little of the earth, which they carefully keep, fancying it procures them luck at play. The bodies and bones, ranged in order, are covered with entire new furs, and over that with bark, on which they throw &s;tones, wood, and earth. Every one returns to his own cabin; but the women come, for &s;everal days after, and pour broth, made of maize, called, &s;agamitty, on the place.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Of their traditions and Religion.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING is more certain, than that the &s;avages of this continent have an idea of a Fir&s;t Being, but, at the &s;ame time, nothing is more ob&s;cure. They argue, in general, in making the fir&s;t &s;pirit, the Lord and Creator of the World; but, when pre&s;&s;ed to give an account of this Fir&s;t Spirit, betray many odd fancies. Fables &s;o ill-conceived, &s;y&s;tems &s;o ill-dige&s;ted, and with &s;o little uniformity, that nothing regular can be &s;aid upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="234">Almo&s;t all the Algonquin nations call this fir&s;t &s;pirit <HI>The Great Hare;</HI> &s;ome call it <HI>Michabou;</HI> others <HI>Atahocan.</HI> The greater part &s;ay, this <HI>Hare</HI> being &s;upported in the waters with all his court, all compo&s;ed of four-footed creatures, like him&s;elf, formed the earth out of a grain of &s;and, taken from the bottom of the ocean, and created men of the dead bodies of animals. There are &s;ome, al&s;o, that &s;peak of a God of the waters, who oppo&s;ed the de&s;ign of the <HI>Great Hare,</HI> or at lea&s;t refu&s;ed to favour it. This God, according to &s;ome, is the Great Tiger; but it is to be ob&s;erved, there are no true tygers in Canada; of cour&s;e, this tradition might be derived from &s;ome other country. They have al&s;o a third God, named <HI>Malco|mek,</HI> whom they invoke during winter.</P>
<P>The <HI>Are&s;koui</HI> of the Hurons, and the <HI>Agre&s;kou&eacute;</HI> of the Irroquois, are, in the opinion of the&s;e people, the Su|preme Being, and the God of War. The&s;e nations do not give the &s;ame origin to men as the Algonquins, and do not go &s;o far back as the creation of the world. They &s;ay there were &s;ix men in the world at fir&s;t, but who placed them there, they know not. They add, that one of the&s;e men went up into heaven, to &s;eek a woman there, named <HI>Atakent&s;ie,</HI> with whom he lived, and who &s;oon appeared to be with child; that the Lord of Heaven perceiving it, threw her down from the highe&s;t part of Heaven, and &s;he was received on the back of a tortoi&s;e. That &s;he brought forth two chil|dren, the elde&s;t of which killed the other; a faint ac|count of Cain and Abel.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="235">They have no tradition after this of the other five men, or even of <HI>Atakent&s;ie</HI>'s hu&s;band; who, according to &s;ome, had but one daughter. The Gods of the &s;avages have, according to their notions, bodies, and live much in the &s;ame manner as we do, but without any of the inconveniencies we are &s;ubject to. The term <HI>&s;pirit</HI> &s;ignifies, among them, only a being of a more excellent nature than the re&s;t. They have no terms to expre&s;s what exceeds the tenets of their under|&s;tanding, which is extremely confined, in any thing that is not the object of their &s;en&s;es, or in common u&s;e; but yet, they give to their pretended &s;pirits a kind of immen&s;ity, which renders them pre&s;ent in all places; for wherever they happen to be, they invoke them, and &s;peak to them.</P>
<P>According to the Irroquois, the po&s;terity of him who &s;lew his brother, went no farther than the third generation: there came, then, a deluge, from which no per&s;on e&s;caped; and, to re-people the earth, bea&s;ts were changed to men. Indeed, the notion of a univer&s;al deluge is generally received among the Aborogines of America; but there &s;eems to have been one of a much later date, confined to this continent. Be&s;ides the Fir&s;t Being, or Great Spirit, and the other gods confounded with him, they have an infinite number of genii, or &s;ubaltern &s;pirits, good and evil, which have their particu|lar wor&s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="236">The Irroquois place <HI>Atakent&s;ie</HI> at the head of the evil &s;pirits; and her &s;on <HI>Jou&s;keka,</HI> he who killed his brother, chief of the good. They addre&s;s the evil genii, only to beg, that they would do them no harm; but they &s;uppo&s;e the others to watch over them for their good, and that every man has his own genius, or guardian &s;pirit. This &s;pirit, in the Huron language, is called <HI>Okkis;</HI> in the Algonquin, <HI>Manitou.</HI> When they go out on any expedition, they carry their <HI>Okkis,</HI> or <HI>Manitou,</HI> with them. They would rather leave their arms behind them than their deities, which are repre&s;ented under certain &s;ymbols. They put them into a &s;ack, painted of various colours, and often, to do honour to the chief, place this &s;ack in the fore-part of his canoe. If there are too many <HI>Manitou,</HI> to be con|tained in one &s;ack, they di&s;tribute them into &s;everal, which are entru&s;ted with the lieutenant and elders of each family. In their marches by land, the chief carries his &s;ack him&s;elf, and, when he grows weary of the load, all are de&s;irous of ea&s;ing him. They have recour&s;e to the&s;e <HI>Manitou</HI> when in any danger, and when they would obtain any extraordinary favour. They think they may a&s;k any thing of them, however unrea&s;onable, or con|trary to good behaviour, or hone&s;ty. But children, they &s;uppo&s;e, are not under their protection. They mu&s;t fir&s;t know how to handle a bow and arrow, to merit this favour; and undergo the following preparation to receive it, which is the mo&s;t important of their life.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="237">They begin, by blacking the child's face. It mu&s;t then fa&s;t eight days, without the lea&s;t nouri&s;hment; and, during this time, his future guardian angel mu&s;t appear to him in his dreams. The empty brain of the child, ju&s;t entering en the fir&s;t &s;tage of youth, can't fail of fur|ni&s;hing him with dreams; and every morning they take care to make him relate them. However, the fa&s;ting often ends before the time appointed, as few children have &s;trength to bear it &s;o long; but this creates no difficulty. They are acquainted here, as in other places, with the convenient u&s;e of di&s;pen&s;ations. The thing which the child dreams of mo&s;t frequently, is &s;uppo&s;ed to be his genius; but, no doubt, this thing was con&s;idered, at fir&s;t, only as a &s;ymbol, or &s;hape, under which the &s;pirit mani|fe&s;ts it&s;elf. But the &s;ame has happened to the&s;e people, as to all tho&s;e who have erred in the Romi&s;h religion: they have attached them&s;elves to the repre&s;entation, and lo&s;t &s;ight of the reality.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ymbols, however, &s;ignify nothing of them&s;elves. Sometimes it is the head of a bird; &s;ometimes the foot of an animal, or a piece of wood; in &s;hort, the mo&s;t ordinary things, and the lea&s;t valued. They pre|&s;erve them, however, with as much care, as the an|tients did their <HI>Penates.</HI> They tell you, there is nothing in nature that has not its tutelar &s;pirit; but they are of all degrees, and have not the &s;ame power. When they do not comprehend a thing, they a&s;&s;ign it to a &s;uperior genius; and &s;ay, in this ca&s;e, "It is a &s;pirit." And
<PB N="227" REF="238">
men of &s;ingular talents, are called &s;pirits, being &s;up|po&s;ed, with them, to have a guardian genius, of a more exalted degree, than men have in general.</P>
<P>In &s;pring, 1779, <HI>Umfreville</HI> tells us, &s;ome Indians, who were employed in the neighbourhood of York-fort, in Hud&s;on's-Bay, were &s;o influenced by the&s;e &s;uper&s;titi|ous ideas, that they believed the devil, with hideous howlings, frequented their tents every night. They came to the factory quite dejected, and told the gover|nor a lamentable tale, &s;etting forth, with pathetic energy, the di&s;tre&s;&s;es they were expo&s;ed to from this vi|&s;itation of the Father of Iniquity. So overcome were they by their apprehen&s;ions, that they kept large fires continually burning all night, and &s;leeping only in the day-time. One of them declared, that he had fired his gun at him, but <HI>unluckily</HI> mi&s;&s;ed him. He de&s;cribed him to be of human &s;hape, going about in cloaths, and taking prodigious &s;trides over the &s;now. The Indians believed that he came in que&s;t of &s;ome of their families, a part of which mu&s;t be &s;acrificed to a&s;wage his anger. A little brandy, however, properly applied, had a won|derful effect; for, after going through a cour&s;e of inebria|tion for two days, all the fears that the devil had occa|&s;ioned, were entirely di&s;&s;ipated. It proved aftewards, that this formidable enemy was nothing more than a night-owl, which had frequented the place. This bird, by the di&s;mal noi&s;e it makes in the night, often cau&s;es &s;uch apprehen&s;ions in the minds of Indians, as to
<PB N="228" REF="239">
work on their imaginations, and make them believe the devil is really and &s;ub&s;tantially pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The jugglers endeavour to per&s;uade the multitude that they are &s;ometimes in a trance; which kind of madne&s;s has exi&s;ted at all times, and among all nations, and has given birth to all the fal&s;e religions. The vanity, which is &s;o natural to mankind, has never imagined a more effectual method to rule over the weak; and the multi|tude, at la&s;t, draw after them tho&s;e who pride them&s;elves mo&s;t in their wi&s;dom. The American impo&s;tors are not behind-hand with any in this point, and they know how to obtain all the advantages from it, which they propo&s;e. The jugglers never omit to publi&s;h, that, during their pretended extacies, their genii give them great information of things done at the greate&s;t di&s;tance, and of future events; and as, by chance, (if we will not allow the devil any &s;hare in it,) they &s;ometimes happen to divine, or gue&s;s pretty right, they acquire a great re|putation, and are reckoned genii of the fir&s;t order.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they have taught a child, what he is to con&s;ider as his guardian genius for the time to come, they in&s;truct him carefully in the obligations he is under to honour him, to follow the coun&s;el he &s;hall receive from him, in his dreams, to merit his favours, to put all his tru&s;t in him, and to dread the effects of his anger, if he neglects his duty towards him. The fe&s;tival termi|nates in a fea&s;t; and the cu&s;tom is, to prick on the body
<PB N="229" REF="240">
of the child the figure of his <HI>Okki,</HI> or his <HI>Manitou.</HI> One would &s;uppo&s;e that &s;uch a &s;olemn engagement, the mark of which can never be effaced, &s;hould be inviola|ble; but a trifle will &s;ometimes break it.</P>
<P>They do not readily acknowledge them&s;elves in the wrong, even with their gods, and make no difficulty to ju&s;tify them&s;elves at their expence. Therefore, the fir&s;t time they have occa&s;ion to condemn them&s;elves, or blame their guardian genius, the fault always falls on the latter; they &s;eek another &s;pirit without any ceremony, and this is done with the &s;ame precautions as at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Different &s;orts of offerings, or &s;acrifices, are made to the&s;e &s;pirits. To render the god of the waters pro|pitious, they throw into the rivers and lakes <HI>petun,</HI> or tobacco, or birds that have had their throats cut. In honour of the &s;un, or inferior &s;pirits, they throw into the fire part of every thing they u&s;e, and which they ac|knowledge to hold from them. This is &s;ometimes done from motives of gratitude, but oftener from intere&s;t. A dog is the mo&s;t common victim which they &s;acrifice; and &s;ometimes they will hang one alive on a tree, by the hind-legs, and leave him there to die raving mad. The war-fea&s;t, which is always of dogs, may very well pa&s;s al&s;o for a &s;acrifice. In &s;hort, they render much the &s;ame honour to the mi&s;chievous &s;pirits, as to the&s;e that are bene|ficent, when they have any thing to fear from their malice.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="241">The belief be&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed among the&s;e people, is that of the immortality of the &s;oul; yet, they do not conceive it purely &s;piritual, any more than they do their genii. They define a &s;oul to be, as it were, the &s;hadow, and the animated image of the body; and it is in con&s;e|quence of this principle, that they believe every thing in the univer&s;e is animated, and it is entirely by tradition that they hold, our &s;ouls never die. Their doctrine is, that the &s;oul, &s;eparated from the body, has &s;till the &s;ame inclinations it had before, which is the rea&s;on why they bury with the dead every thing they u&s;ed whil&s;t living. They are al&s;o per&s;uaded, that the &s;oul remains near the corp&s;e at the fe&s;tival of the dead, which I have de&s;cribed, and that afterwards it goes into the country of &s;ouls; where, according to &s;ome, it is transformed into a dove.</P>
<P>Others think there are two &s;ouls in every man, attri|buting to one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">l I have ju&s;t mentioned; and &s;aying, that the other never leaves one body, but to go into &s;ome other; which they are of opinion, however, &s;eldom happens but to the &s;ouls of children, who, having en|joyed but little of life, are allowed to begin a new one. On this account, they bury children by the high-way-&s;ide, that women, as they pa&s;s by, may gather their &s;ouls. Now, &s;ay they, the&s;e &s;ouls, which &s;o faithfully keep company with their bodies, mu&s;t be fed; and it is to fulfil this duty, that they carry provi&s;ions to the graves. But this does not la&s;t long, as they expect &s;uch &s;ouls, in time, to accu&s;tom them&s;elves to fa&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="242">But one thing which the&s;e people never &s;ail to per|form, in whatever extremity they find them&s;elves, is, that as among us the &s;pirits of the dead enrich the living, among them, they not only carry to the grave all that the decea&s;ed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, but al&s;o pre&s;ents from their friends and relations.</P>
<P>The country, &s;ay the&s;e &s;avages, to which &s;ouls go when &s;eparated from their bodies, lies very far to the we&s;t, and are &s;everal months travelling there. They have al&s;o great difficulties to &s;urmount, and run through great danger before they arrive there. They talk of a river they have to pa&s;s, where many have been wrecked; of a dog from which they find it hard to defend them|&s;elves; of a place of torments, where they expiate their &s;aults; and another where the &s;ouls of pri&s;oners of war that have been burnt are tormented.</P>
<P>This notion is the rea&s;on why, after the death of the&s;e wretches, for fear their &s;ouls &s;hould &s;tay about the cabins, to revenge their &s;ufferings, they very carefully vi&s;it all places, &s;triking continually with a &s;tick, and &s;end|ing forth hideous cries to drive them away.</P>
<P>Among the fabulous &s;tories, which they tell of what pa&s;&s;es in hell, which &s;o much re&s;emble tho&s;e of <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> there is one, that &s;eems copied from <HI>Or|pheus</HI> and <HI>Euridice.</HI> There is &s;carce any thing in it to change, but the names. The happine&s;s which they hope
<PB N="232" REF="243">
to enjoy in this fancied ely&s;ium, they do not con&s;ider ab|&s;olutely as the reward of virtue. To have been a good hunter, a gallant warrior, and fortunate in all enterprizes; to have killed and burnt a great number of enemies, are the only titles that give them a right to paradi&s;e; all the happine&s;s of which con&s;i&s;ts in finding places to hunt and fi&s;h in that never fail, an eternal &s;pring, great plenty of all things without labour, and all the plea&s;ures of &s;en&s;e. This is all they a&s;k of their gods in this life. All their &s;ongs, wiiich are in fact their prayers, run only on the pre&s;ent good. They think them&s;elves &s;ure of being happy in the other world, in proportion to what they have been in this.</P>
<P>The &s;ouls of bea&s;ts have al&s;o, with them, a place in the country of &s;ouls. They allow them, likewi&s;e, a &s;ort of rea&s;on; and not only each &s;pecies, but each animal, if we believe them, has al&s;o its guardian genius. In a word, they make no difference between us and brutes, but that our &s;ouls are &s;omething of a better &s;ort.</P>
<P>But, among all their &s;uper&s;tition and extravagance, there is nothing more idle than what regards their dreams. Sometimes they &s;ay, it is the rea&s;onable &s;oul that wanders, whil&s;t the &s;en&s;itive &s;oul continues to animate the body. Sometimes, it is the familiar ge|nius, that gives good advice about future events. Sometimes, it is a vi&s;it they receive from the &s;oul of the object they dream of; but, whatever conception they have of dreams, they are always con&s;idered as &s;acred
<PB N="233" REF="244">
things, and as the means which their gods mo&s;t u&s;ually employ, to declare their wills to men.</P>
<P>Now it is not the per&s;on alone, who dreams, that mu&s;t &s;atisfy the obligations that he imagines are impo&s;ed on by it; but it would al&s;o be a crime in any per&s;on that he addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to, to refu&s;e him any thing he de&s;ired in dreaming; and this often has di&s;agreeable con&s;e|quences. If the thing de&s;ired is of &s;uch a nature, that it cannot be &s;upplied by a private per&s;on, the public take up the matter, and will have it found, if at the di&s;tance of 500 leagues. If it is an inanimate thing, they are more ea&s;y; but if an animate, its death cau&s;es &s;urprizing unea&s;ine&s;s. Nay, if any one takes it into his head to dream that he knocks another man's brains out, he will do it if he can; and he mu&s;t expect the &s;ame if another dreams that of him. But a little pre&s;ence of mind will remedy this fear. It is only knowing how to oppo&s;e &s;uch a dream, by another, that contradicts it. "Then," &s;ays the fir&s;t dreamer, "I &s;ee plainly, that your &s;pirit is &s;tronger than mine; therefore, let us talk no more about it."</P>
<P>They have a kind of bacchanal, which they call the fe&s;tival of dreams; but which the Irroquois, and &s;ome others, more properly, call, "The turning of the brain." It is celebrated about the end of winter, and commonly la&s;ts 15 days. At this time, they act all kinds of
<PB N="234" REF="245">
fooleries, and every one runs from cabin to cabin, di&s;|gui&s;ed in a thou&s;and ridiculous ways. They break and over&s;et every thing; and no one dares to contradict it. If they meet any one, they de&s;ire him to gue&s;s their dream; and if they gue&s;s it, it is at their own expence; for the gue&s;&s;er mu&s;t give the thing they dreamt of. When it ends, they return every thing, make a great fea&s;t, and &s;tudy only how to repair the &s;ad effects of the ma&s;querade; for it is commonly no trifling bu&s;ine&s;s. Indeed, they take the opportunity of this fe&s;tival, to give tho&s;e a &s;ound drubbing, who have affronted or in|jured them; but, when the time is over, every thing is forgotten.</P>
<P>The &s;avages, in general, acknowledge only the ope|rations of the good genii. It is the wizards alone, and tho&s;e who u&s;e enchantments who are reported to hold corre&s;pondence with the evil; and it is women chiefly that follow this dete&s;table profe&s;&s;ion. The jugglers not only forbear it, but profe&s;s openly their &s;tudy is, to prevent their pernicious effects. It is certain, that among tho&s;e who practice the art of juggling, the bolde&s;t are the mo&s;t re&s;pected; and, with a little artifice, they ea&s;ily per&s;uade people, who are brought up in &s;uper&s;tition, though they have &s;een the birth of the&s;e importers: if they chu&s;e to give them&s;elves a &s;upernatural birth, they will find people to credit their a&s;&s;ertion, as much as if they had &s;een them come down from heaven; and who
<PB N="235" REF="246">
believe their being born like other men, was a mere il|lu&s;ion. But, in general, their artifices are &s;o gro&s;s, and &s;o common, that there are none but fools and children that are impo&s;ed on by them, except it is, when they act as phy&s;icians; for every one knows, that in what concerns the recovery of health, the greate&s;t credulity is to be found in all countries, as well among tho&s;e who pride them&s;elves on their wi&s;dom as among the weaker cla&s;s of people.</P>
<P>The Blackfoot Paegan, and Blood Indians, have a cu&s;tom peculiar to them&s;elves, that of cutting off the joints of their fingers, beginning with the little finger, and taking off a joint, as often as &s;uper&s;tition prompts them. This is advanced on the credit of Mr. <HI>Umfreville,</HI> who &s;ays, he could never learn the cau&s;e of this &s;ingular cu&s;tom; nor did he ever ob&s;erve any but old men, that had their fingers thus mutilated.</P>

<P>Many nations have each three families, or principal tribes, as ancient, in all probability, as their origin, yet, neverthele&s;s, derived from the &s;ame &s;tock; and there is one, who is looked upon as the fir&s;t, which has a &s;ort of pre-eminence over the other two, who &s;tile tho&s;e of this tribe brothers, whereas, between them&s;elves, they call each other cou&s;ins. The&s;e tribes are mixed, with|out being confounded, each having its di&s;tinct chief, in every village; and, in the affairs which concern the whole nation, the&s;e chiefs a&s;&s;emble to deliberate upon them. Each tribe bears the name of &s;ome animal; and the whole nation has al&s;o one, who&s;e name they take, and who&s;e figure is their badge, or coat of arms. They &s;ign treaties, by tracing the&s;e figures on them, unle&s;s
<PB N="237" REF="248">
particular rea&s;ons bid them to &s;ub&s;titute others. Thus the Huron nation is the nation of the Porcupine, and its fir&s;t tribe bears the name of the Bear. The other two, are the Wolf and the Tortoi&s;e. The Irroquois nations have the &s;ame animals as the Huron; and thus appear to be branches of the &s;ame colony.</P>
<P>The conferring, or giving the&s;e titles, is always per|formed with great ceremony. The new chief makes a fea&s;t, and gives pre&s;ents, &s;peaks the eulogium of his predece&s;&s;or, and &s;ings his &s;ong. In the north, and in all places where the Algonquin language prevails, the dignity of chief is elective. Among the Hurons, where it is hereditary, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is continued by the woman's &s;ide; &s;o that at the death of the chief, it is not his &s;on that &s;ucceeds him, but his &s;i&s;ter's &s;on; or, in ca&s;e of failure of &s;uch, the neare&s;t relation by the female line. If a whole branch is extinct, the noble&s;t matron of the tribe chu&s;es the per&s;on &s;he likes be&s;t, and declares him chief.</P>
<P>They mu&s;t, however, be of an age fit to govern; and if the &s;ucce&s;&s;or is not of age, a regent is cho&s;en, who has all the authority; but who exerci&s;es it in the name of the minor. In general, the&s;e chiefs do not receive any great marks of re&s;pect; and if they are always obeyed, it is, becau&s;e they know how far their commands will have force. They, indeed, rather intreat, or propo&s;e, than command; and never exceed the bounds of the little authority they have. Thus it is rea&s;on that governs, and
<PB N="238" REF="249">
the government is the more effectual, as the obedience is more voluntary; and there is no fear of its degenerating into tyranny.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, every family chu&s;es them&s;elves a coun|&s;ellor, or an a&s;&s;i&s;tant to the chief, who is to watch over their intere&s;ts, and without who&s;e advice the chief can undertake nothing. The&s;e coun&s;ellors are particularly obliged to take care of the public trea&s;ure; and it be|longs to them, to direct how it is to be employed. In the Huron nations the women name the coun&s;ellors; and they often chu&s;e per&s;ons of their own &s;ex.</P>
<P>This body of coun&s;ellors, or a&s;&s;i&s;tants, is the fir&s;t a&s;&s;embly: that of the elders, or tho&s;e who have at|tained the age of maturity, is the &s;econd; the la&s;t, is that of the warriors, or all tho&s;e who are able to bear arms. This la&s;t body has often the chief of the nation, or village, at its head, but he mu&s;t fir&s;t have di&s;tin|gui&s;hed him&s;elf by &s;ome brave action; otherwi&s;e, he is obliged to &s;erve as a &s;ubaltern, or common &s;oldier; for in the&s;e &s;avage armies, there is no intermediate rank.</P>
<P>A great party may, indeed, have &s;everal chiefs, be|cau&s;e they give this title to all tho&s;e, who ever had a command; but the&s;e are not the le&s;s &s;ubject to the com|mander of the party. The women have the men's whole authority, among the people of the Huron language, if we except the Irroquois Canton of On|neyouth,
<PB N="239" REF="250">
where it is alternate between the &s;exes. But though this is their law, the women &s;eldom interfere, the chiefs tran&s;acting all the bu&s;ine&s;s in their name.</P>
<P>In the general council of elders, they proceed with &s;uch prudence, maturity, and ability; and, for the mo&s;t part, with &s;uch probity, as would have done honour to the Areopagus of Athens, and the &s;enate of Rome, in the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing times of the&s;e republics. The rea&s;on is, that they conclude nothing ha&s;tily, and that the &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, which have made &s;uch alterations in the &s;y&s;tems of policy, even among chri&s;tians, have not yet prevailed in the&s;e &s;avages over the public good. The parties concerned, do not fail to employ &s;ecret &s;prings, and &s;uch intrigue to accompli&s;h their de&s;igns, that one would &s;carce believe could enter into the thoughts of &s;uch barbarians. They po&s;&s;e&s;s in the highe&s;t degree the great art of concealing their proceedings; and, in general, the glory of the nation, and motives of honour, are the chief &s;prings of all their undertakings. Their great failing is revenge; revenge without bounds, and which their chief honour lies in the gratification of: a fault which chri&s;tianity only can thoroughly reform, and which all our politene&s;s and religion does not always correct.</P>
<P>Each tribe has its orator in every village, and there are few, but the&s;e orators, who have a right to &s;peak in the public councils, and the general a&s;&s;emblies; and
<PB N="240" REF="251">
the&s;e always &s;peak, and to the purpo&s;e. One would &s;uppo&s;e, that people who have little or no po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, either public or private, and who have no ambition to extend them&s;elves, &s;hould have very few things to ad|ju&s;t with each other. But the &s;pirit of man, naturally re&s;tle&s;s, cannot remain without action, and is ingenious in finding it&s;elf employment. This is certain, that the&s;e &s;avages negotiate continually, and have always &s;ome affair on the carpet. They have &s;ome treaties to con|clude, or renew, offers of &s;ervice to make, mutual civi|lities to &s;hew, alliances to court, invitations to join in war, or condolences on the death of a chief to convey. All this is done with a dignity, an attention, nay, with, an ability, worthy of the mo&s;t important affairs.</P>
<P>The Irroquois nation has, for the la&s;t two ages, made the greate&s;t figure in Canada. By their &s;ucce&s;&s;es in war, they have gained a &s;uperiority over the greate&s;t part of the other nations. As to what relates to private per&s;ons, and the particular concerns of their villages, they are reduced to a very &s;mall compa&s;s, and are &s;oon decided. The greate&s;t defect of this government is, that they have no puni&s;hment for crimes; but this de|fect has not the &s;ame con&s;equences here, as it would have with us; &s;o &s;el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">-intere&s;t, which governs us, and is the &s;ource of almo&s;t all our crimes, can &s;carce have any power over a people, who never think of laying up riches, and who take little thought for the morrow.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="252">To enter into all the police of &s;uch barbarous nations, would be little entertainment, or improvement, to our readers, unle&s;s their laws were better &s;tudied than they are; as the government of each country is generally adapted to its &s;ituation, and its wants, a civilized nation can profit little by the laws and practice of barbarians. I will, therefore, drop any further ob&s;ervations on the &s;ub|ject, and proceed to their manner of making war.</P>
<P>I have already noticed, that the god of war, by the Hurons, is called <HI>Are&s;koui,</HI> and by the Irroquois <HI>Agre|&s;kou&eacute;.</HI> It is worth remarking, that &s;everal of the terms, which relate to war, in the Huron and Irroquois lan|guages, &s;eem to have been derived from the Greek word <HI>Ares,</HI> who is the <HI>Mars,</HI> or god of war, in all the countries where they have followed the theology of <HI>Homer. Aregouen</HI> &s;ignifies to make war, and is thus de|clined; <HI>Garigo,</HI> I make war; <HI>Sarego,</HI> thou make&s;t war; <HI>Arego,</HI> he makes war, and &s;o on. <HI>Are&s;koui</HI> is not only the <HI>Mars</HI> of the&s;e people, but he is al&s;o their chief god, or, as they expre&s;s it, the Great Spirit, and the Creator and Ma&s;|ter of the World. But it is chiefly for military expeditions that they invoke him, as if the attribute that does him the mo&s;t honour, was that of the <HI>God of Ho&s;ts.</HI> His name is the war-cry before battle, and in the height of the engagement. On their march, al&s;o, they often repeat it, by way of encouraging each other, and to implore his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="253">To take up the hatchet is to declare war; every pri|vate per&s;on has a right to do it, without any one having a power to hinder him, unle&s;s it be among the Hurons and Irroquois, where mothers of families can declare or for|bid war, when they plea&s;e. When war is declared for|mally again&s;t two nations, the manner of expre&s;&s;ing it, is, "To hang the kettle on the fire;" which has its origin in the barbarous cu&s;tom of eating the pri&s;oners, and tho&s;e that were &s;lain, after they had boiled them. They &s;ay, al&s;o, in direct words, that they are going "To eat a nation;" &s;ignifying, that they will make a cruel war again&s;t it. When they would engage an ally in their quarrel, they &s;end him a porcelain, that is a great &s;hell, to invite him to drink the blood; or, according to their meaning, the broth of the fle&s;h of their enemies. For the porcelain of the&s;e countries, is the Venus &s;hell of Canada, which is there con&s;idered as a precious &s;tone. After all, this cu&s;tom may be very ancient; but it does not follow from hence, that the&s;e people were always man-eaters. It was, perhaps, in the primitive times, only an allegorical way of &s;peaking, &s;uch as we find often in &s;cripture. The enemies of <HI>David,</HI> did not, as appears, make it a cu&s;tom to eat the fle&s;h of their ene|mies, when he &s;aid, P&s;alm xxvii. v. 2. "When the wicked, even mine enemies, and my foes, came upon me, to eat up my fle&s;h." In after times, certain nations, that were become &s;avage and barbarous, &s;ub&s;tituted the fact, in the room of the figure.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="254">It &s;eldom happens, that the&s;e barbarians refu&s;e to en|gage in a war, when they are invited to it by their allies. Indeed, they have no need of invitation to take up arms; the lea&s;t trifle is a &s;ufficient motive, particularly revenge, for &s;ome old or new injury; for time never heals &s;uch wounds, however &s;light they were.</P>
<P>A war, which concerns all the nation, is well weighed, before determined on; and whil&s;t they deliberate, they are extremely careful to avoid every thing that would give the enemy the lea&s;t cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect they intend to break with them. War being re&s;olved on, they directly con&s;ider of the provi&s;ions, and the equipage of the women; the dances, &s;ongs, fea&s;ts, and &s;ome &s;uper&s;titi|ous ceremonies. He, who is to command, does not think of rai&s;ing men, till he has fa&s;ted &s;everal days, dur|ing which he is &s;meared with black, holds &s;carce any conver&s;ation with any one, invokes his tutelar &s;pirit, day and night; and, above all, is very careful to ob&s;erve his dreams. The fa&s;t being over, he a&s;&s;embles his friends, and, with a collar of beads in his hand, thus addre&s;&s;es them: <Q>The Great Spirit, brethren, approves my &s;entiments, in&s;pires me with what I ought to do, and authori&s;es my intentions. The blood of &s;uch an one, is not wiped away; his body is not covered; and I will acquit my&s;elf of the duty I owe him: I am re|&s;olved, therefore, to go to &s;uch a place, and eat &s;uch a nation. If I peri&s;h in the enterprize, or &s;hould any who accompany me lo&s;e their lives, this collar &s;hall
<PB N="244" REF="255">
&s;erve to receive us, that we may not continue to lie in the di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t:</Q> meaning, by this, that the collar, which is a badge of honour, &s;hall belong to him, who &s;hall take care to bury the dead. In pronouncing the&s;e la&s;t words, he lays the collar on the ground, and he who takes it up, declares him&s;elf his lieutenant. This done, they heat water, wa&s;h the face of the chief, &s;et his hair in order, grea&s;e it, and paint it. They al&s;o paint his face with various colours, and put on his fine&s;t robe. Thus adorned, he &s;ings the death &s;ong, in a low tone of voice; and his &s;oldiers, tho&s;e that chu&s;e to follow him, &s;ing out their war &s;ong, with a loud voice, one after another; for every man has his own &s;ong, which no other is allowed to &s;ing. There are &s;ome, al&s;o, peculiar to each family.</P>
<P>After this preliminary, the chief communicates his project to the council, who con&s;ult on it alone, and as &s;oon as it is accepted, the chief is admitted. He then makes a fea&s;t, of which the principal di&s;h is a dog. All this la&s;ts many days; and though all the people &s;eem employed in the fea&s;t, each family puts in its claim to a &s;hare of the pri&s;oners that &s;hall be made, in order to re|pair their lo&s;&s;es, or revenge their &s;lain. Among the Irroquois, as &s;oon as a military expedition is re&s;olved on, they &s;et the kettle of war on the fire, and give notice to their allies, to bring &s;omething for it. The party being formed, the war-chief prepares a new fea&s;t, to which all the village is invited; and before any thing
<PB N="245" REF="256">
is touched, he, or an orator in his name, cries out, <Q>Young men, take courage, dre&s;s your hair, paint your faces, fill your quivers, and make our fore&s;ts re&s;ound with your &s;ongs of war, for the bones of our friends cry out for revenge, and we will relieve the cares of the dead.</Q></P>
<P>After this &s;peech, and the applau&s;es that never fail to follow it, the chief advances into the mid&s;t of the a&s;&s;embly, with his fighting-club, or head-breaker, in his hand, and &s;ings. All his &s;oldiers an&s;wer him &s;inging, and &s;wear to &s;upport him, or die in the attempt. None, however, drop any expre&s;&s;ion, that denotes the lea&s;t de|pendence; they only promi&s;e to act with union and harmony. Their &s;ongs are followed by dances; which are, &s;ometimes, merely walking to time in a proud &s;tep; at others, jumping in lively motions, repre&s;enting the operations of a campaign, but all to time. The war-chief is only a &s;pectator, with a pipe in his mouth.</P>
<P>To try the warriors, the Irroquois never fail, before an expedition, to proceed in the following manner, not conceiving that any man can have true courage, if he is not ma&s;ter of his pa&s;&s;ions, and cannot bear the highe&s;t provocations. The olde&s;t of the military troop, affront the young people in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t manner they can think of, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who have never &s;een an enemy. They throw hot coals upon their heads, reproach them &s;harply, load them with the mo&s;t injurious expre&s;&s;ions, and carry
<PB N="246" REF="257">
this game to the greate&s;t extremity. This mu&s;t be borne with a perfect in&s;en&s;ibility; to &s;hew the lea&s;t impatience, would deem the per&s;on &s;o in&s;ulted, unworthy to bear arms for ever. On &s;etting out, they take with them certain drugs, that their jugglers have a&s;&s;ured them they have given a power to heal the greate&s;t wounds, and which they are idle enough to believe.</P>
<P>On the day of departure, they take their leave of their friends with great demon&s;trations of real tenderne&s;s. Every one de&s;ires &s;omething that has been u&s;ed by the warriors, and, in return, give them &s;ome pledge of their friend&s;hip and a&s;&s;urance of a perpetual remembrance. They &s;carce enter any cabin, but they take away their robe, to give them a better. Every &s;oldier paints his face, according to his own fancy, but all in a frightful manner. The chief leads the way, &s;ings his death &s;ong, and the whole party follows him in a line, keeping pro|found &s;ilence; and this they do every morning, when they renew their march. The women go before with provi&s;ions, and, when the warriors come up with them, they give their cloaths into their cu&s;tody, remaining as naked as the &s;ea&s;on will admit.</P>
<P>The arms of the&s;e people formerly were bows and arrows, and a kind of javelin, which, as well as their arrows, were pointed with bone; be&s;ides this, they had a little club of hard wood, with a round head, and a cut|ting edge, called a head-breaker. The we&s;tern &s;avages
<PB N="247" REF="258">
have bull's-hide bucklers, light, and proof again&s;t a mu&s;quet ball. They are now furni&s;hed with &s;words and guns; our &s;words they u&s;e like &s;pontoons. With their arms, they never forget to take their <HI>manitous,</HI> or guardian &s;pirits.</P>
<P>When they embark upon an expedition, the canoes fir&s;t go a little way, then range them&s;elves clo&s;e together in a line. This done, the chief ri&s;es up, and holding a <HI>chichicou&eacute;</HI> in his hand, thunders out his &s;ong of war, and his &s;oldiers an&s;wer him by a treble <HI>h&eacute;,</HI> drawn, with all their &s;trength, from the bottom of their brea&s;ts. The elders, and chiefs of the council, who remain on &s;hore, exhort the warriors to behave well, and not &s;uffer them&s;elves to be &s;urprized: But this exhortation does not interrupt the chief, who continues &s;inging. The warriors then conjure their relations and friends not to forget them, &s;end forth, altogether, a hideous howl, and run off with &s;uch &s;peed as &s;oon to be out of &s;ight.</P>
<P>When out on an expedition, they &s;eldom make any &s;hort marches, e&s;pecially when their troop is numerous. They take, however, pre&s;ages of every thing; and the jugglers, who accompany them, and who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to explain the&s;e predictions, ha&s;ten or retard the marches at their plea&s;ure. Whil&s;t they are not in a &s;u&s;pected country, they take little precaution, &s;eparate, and each takes his own way to hunt; but, however they may
<PB N="248" REF="259">
&s;tray from the route, they all return punctually to the place, and at the hour appointed, for their rendezvous.</P>
<P>They encamp a long time before &s;un-&s;et, and com|monly leave before their camp a large &s;pace, &s;ur|rounded with pali&s;adoes, or a &s;ort of lattice, on which they fix their manitous, turned to the place they are go|ing to. They invoke them for an hour, and do the &s;ame every morning before they decamp. After this, they have nothing to fear; they conceive the manitous to be their centinels, and the whole army &s;leeps quietly under their &s;uppo&s;ed &s;afe-guard. Experience does not undeceive the&s;e barbarians, nor bring them out of their pre&s;umptuous confidence. It has its &s;ource in an indo|lence and lazine&s;s, which nothing can conquer.</P>
<P>Every one is an enemy in the way of the warriors; but &s;hould they meet, on their march, with any of their allies, or any party equally numerous with them|&s;elves, with whom they have no quarrel, they make friend&s;hip with each other. If the allies they meet, are at war with the &s;ame enemy, the chief of the &s;tronge&s;t party, or of that which took up arms fir&s;t, gives &s;ome &s;calp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the other, which are the &s;kins of the heads of pri&s;oners taken, or an enemy &s;lain, and which they are always provided with on the&s;e occa&s;ions; and &s;ays to him, "You have done your bu&s;ine&s;s;" that is to &s;ay, you have ful<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ll<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d your engagements; your honour is &s;afe; you may return home. But this is to be under&s;tood,
<PB N="249" REF="260">
when the meeting is accidental, and when they have no occa&s;ion for a reinforcement. As &s;oon as they enter on an enemy's country, they &s;top, make a great fea&s;t at night, and then lay down to &s;leep. When they awake, tho&s;e who have had any dreams, go from fire to fire, &s;inging their death &s;ong, with which they intermix their dreams in an enigmatical manner. Every one racks his brain to gue&s;s them; and if no one can do it, the dreamer is at liberty to return home. This gives a fine opportunity to cowards. Next they make new invocations to their &s;pirits, animate each other, more than ever, to do won|ders, &s;wear to a&s;&s;i&s;t each other to the utmo&s;t, and re|new their march. If they come there by water, they now quit their canoes and hide them. Every evening they &s;end out rangers, who employ two or three hours looking round the country; and, if they have &s;een nothing, they go to &s;leep quietly, leaving the camp, as before, to the guard of their manitous.</P>
<P>When they di&s;cover the enemy, they &s;end out a party to reconnoitre them; and, on their report, hold a coun|cil. The attack is generally made at day-break. They &s;uppo&s;e the enemy is at this time in their deepe&s;t &s;leep; and all night they lie on their bellies, without &s;tirring. The approaches are made in the &s;ame po&s;ture, crawling on their feet and hands, till they come to the place. Then, all ri&s;ing up, the chief gives the &s;ignal by a little cry, to which all the troop an&s;wer, by real howlings, and, at the &s;ame time, make their fir&s;t di&s;|charge.
<PB N="250" REF="261">
Then, without giving the enemy any time to look about, fall on them with their clubs. In latter times the&s;e people have &s;ub&s;tituted tomahawks, or little hatchets, in&s;tead of head-breakers; and &s;ince which, their engagements are more bloody. When the battle is over, they take the &s;calps of the dead and dying, and never think of making pri&s;oners till the enemy makes no more re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Should they find the enemy on their guard, or too well entrenched, they retreat, if they have time for it, if not, they take the re&s;olution to fight &s;toutly; and there is &s;ometimes much blood&s;hed on both &s;ides. The attack of a camp, is the image of fury it&s;elf; the barbarous fiercene&s;s of the conquerors, and the de&s;pair of the van|qui&s;hed, who know their fate, if they fall into the ene|mies' hands, produce, on both &s;ides, &s;uch efforts, as pa&s;s all de&s;cription. The appearance of the combatants, all be&s;meared with black and red, &s;till increa&s;es the horror of the fight. When the victory is no longer doubtful, they directly di&s;patch all tho&s;e whom it would be too trouble&s;ome to carry off, and &s;eek only to tire out the re&s;t they intend to make pri&s;oners of.</P>
<P>They are naturally intrepid; and, notwith&s;tanding their brutal fiercene&s;s, pre&s;erve, in the mid&s;t of action, much coolne&s;s, and never fight in the field, but when they can't avoid it; from an opinion, that victory, marked with the blood of the conquerors, is not properly a victory,
<PB N="251" REF="262">
and that the glory of a chief, con&s;i&s;ts principally, in bringing back all his people &s;afe and &s;ound.</P>
<P>The war of the&s;e barbarians is commonly made by &s;urprize, and generally &s;ucceeds; for as they very frequently neglect the precautions nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hun a &s;urprize, &s;o are they active and &s;kilful in &s;urprizing. They have a wonder|ful talent, I may call it in&s;tinct, of finding out whether any per&s;on has pa&s;&s;ed a place. On the &s;horte&s;t gra&s;s, on the harde&s;t ground, even upon &s;tones, they will di&s;cover foot-&s;teps; and by the way they are turned, by the &s;hape of the foot, and the manner they are &s;eparated from each other, they will di&s;tingui&s;h the foot-&s;teps of different nations, and tho&s;e of men from tho&s;e of women.</P>
<P>Till the conquerors are in a country of &s;afety, they march forward expeditiou&s;ly; and, le&s;t the wounded &s;hould retard their retreat, carry them by turns on litters, or in winter, draw them on &s;ledges. When they re-enter their canoes, they make their pri&s;oners &s;ing, and do the &s;ame every time they meet their allies, an honour which co&s;ts them a fea&s;t who receive it, and the unfor|tunate captive &s;omething more than the trouble of &s;ing|ing; for they invite their allies to care&s;s them, and to <HI>care&s;s</HI> a pri&s;oner, is to do him all the mi&s;chief they can devi&s;e, or maim him in &s;uch a manner as to lame him for ever. But there are chiefs who will take care that their pri&s;oners are not too much ill-treated: le&s;t they

&s;hould e&s;cape, they are tied by the neck and arms to one of the oars of the canoe in the day-time, (when they go by land, there is always one that holds them,) and at night they are &s;tretched on the earth quite naked, and &s;ome cords, fa&s;tened to piquets fixed in the ground, keep their legs, arms, and neck, &s;o confined; and &s;ome long cords al&s;o confine their hands and feet in &s;uch a manner, that they cannot make the lea&s;t motion without waking the &s;avages who lie upon the&s;e cords.</P>
<P>If among the pri&s;oners, there are found any, who, by their wounds are not in a condition to be carried away, they burn them directly; and, as this is done in the fir&s;t heat, and when they are often in ha&s;te to retreat, they are generally quit at an ea&s;ier rate than the re&s;t, who are re&s;erved for a &s;lower puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>The cu&s;tom among &s;ome nations is, that the chief of the victorious party, leaves on the field of battle his fighting club, on which he traces the mark of his na|tion, that of his family, and the oval of his face, with all the figures he had on his face, traced on that oval. Others paint all the&s;e marks on the trunk of a tree. Others will add hieroglyphic characters; by means of which, all pa&s;&s;ers-by are made acquainted with the chief, and all the bu&s;ine&s;s of the campaign.</P>
<P>When the warriors, on their return, are arrived at a certain di&s;tance from the village from whence they came,
<PB N="253" REF="264">
they halt, and the chief &s;ends one forward to announce his approach. This man, when within hearing, makes various cries, and the young people, and &s;ometimes the whole village, come out to meet him, and learn the particulars. As the me&s;&s;enger, or herald, relates a fact, one of the party, come out to meet him, repeats it aloud to tho&s;e that are with him, and they all an|&s;wer by acclamations, or di&s;mal cries, according as the news is mournful, or plea&s;ing. The herald is then conducted to a cabin, where the elders inquire all the particulars, after which, a public crier invites all the young folks to go and meet the warriors, and the women to carry them refre&s;hments. The moment the women join them is, properly &s;peaking, the beginning of the puni&s;hment of the pri&s;oners. In &s;ome nations, they will adopt a pri&s;oner in the room of &s;ome relation they have lo&s;t in war; in which ca&s;e, they e&s;cape puni&s;hment. But &s;uch as are de&s;tined to death, and tho&s;e who&s;e fate are not yet decided, are abandoned to the fury of the women that go out to meet them; and if any woman has lo&s;t either her &s;on or her hu&s;band, or any other per&s;on that was dear to her, though this lo&s;s had happened thirty years before, &s;he is a fury, &s;he attacks the fir&s;t pri&s;oner who falls in her way, has no regard either to humanity or decency, flies at him with rage, and every wound &s;he gives him, one would expect him to fall at her feet, if we did not know the ingenuity of the&s;e bar|barians in prolonging the mo&s;t unheard-of puni&s;hment.
<PB N="254" REF="265">
All the night pa&s;&s;es in this manner in the camp of the warriors.</P>
<P>The next day is their triumph. The Irroquois, and &s;ome others, affect a great mode&s;ty, and a &s;till greater di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s on the&s;e occa&s;ions. The chiefs enter the village alone, without any mark of victory, keeping profound &s;ilence, and retire to their cabins, without &s;hewing the lea&s;t preten&s;ion to the pri&s;oners. Among other nations, the chief marches at the head of his troop with the air of a conqueror, his lieutenant follows him, and a crier goes before renewing the death-cries. The warriors follow two by two, and the pri&s;oners in the mid&s;t, crowned with flowers, their faces and hair painted, holding a &s;tick in one hand, a <HI>chichikou&eacute;</HI> in the other, their bodies almo&s;t naked, their arms tied above the elbow, by a cord, which the warriors hold, and the pri&s;oners &s;inging their death-&s;ong, to the &s;ound of the <HI>chichikou&eacute;.</HI></P>
<P>This &s;ong has &s;omething mournful, and yet haughty, in it, and the captive has nothing in him of the air of a man, who &s;uffers or is vanqui&s;hed. The &s;en&s;e of the&s;e &s;ongs is pretty nearly as follows: <Q>I am brave and intrepid, and fear not death, nor any kind of torture; tho&s;e who do, are cowards, and le&s;s than warriors. Life is <HI>nothing</HI> to a brave man! May my enemies be con|founded with rage and de&s;pair! Oh, that I could de|vour them, and drink their blood to the la&s;t drop!</Q> From time to time they &s;top them; the people gather
<PB N="255" REF="266">
round, and make the pri&s;oners dance, who &s;eem to do it with a good will; and, whil&s;t they dance, relate the fine&s;t actions of their lives; boa&s;t of tho&s;e they have killed and burnt, and particularly tho&s;e, if any, for whom the per&s;ons pre&s;ent are mo&s;t concerned; thus rou&s;ing the re&s;entment of the ma&s;ters of their fate. In fact, the&s;e boa&s;tings make tho&s;e who hear them quite furious, and they, of cour&s;e, pay dear for their vanity. By the manner in which they receive the mo&s;t cruel treatment, one would be led to &s;uppo&s;e, they took a plea&s;ure in being tormented.</P>
<P>Sometimes they oblige the pri&s;oners to run through two ranks of &s;avages, armed with &s;tones and &s;ticks, who fall on them as if they would knock them on the head at the fir&s;t blow; yet they never kill them, taking care, in all their fury, not to touch a part that would en|danger life. In this march to the village, every one has a right to torment them. They are indeed allowed to defend them&s;elves; but were they to attempt it, they would &s;oon be overpowered. When arrived at the vil|lage, they lead them from cabin to cabin, and every where make them pay their welcome. In one place they tear off one of their nails, at another, bite off one of their fingers, or cut it off with a bad knife, that cuts like a &s;aw; an old man &s;hall tear their fle&s;h quite to the bone, or child wound them where he can with an awl; a woman &s;hall whip them, without mercy, till &s;he is &s;o tired, that &s;he cannot lift her arms. But
<PB N="256" REF="267">
the warriors them&s;elves, who are &s;till their ma&s;ters, never lay a hand on them, nor can any one mutilate a pri&s;oner, without their leave, which they &s;eldom grant; but, this excepted, they have an entire liberty to make them &s;uffer; and if they lead them through &s;everal vil|lages, either of the &s;ame nation, or their neighbours, or allies, who have reque&s;ted it, they are received every where in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>After the&s;e preludes, they &s;et about di&s;tributing the captives, and their fate depends on tho&s;e to whom they are delivered. At the ri&s;ing of the council, where their fate has been debated, a crier comes forth, and invites all the people to an open place, where the di&s;tribution is made, without noi&s;e or di&s;pute. Tho&s;e women who have lo&s;t their children or hu&s;bands in the war, generally receive the fir&s;t lot. In the next place, they fulfil their promi&s;es at fir&s;t &s;etting out. If there are not captives enough, they &s;upply the want of them by &s;calps, which the receivers wear on rejoicing days, or hang up at their cabin doors. On the contrary, if the number of pri&s;oners exceeds the claims, they &s;end the overplus to the villages of their allies. A chief is not re-placed, but by a chief, or by two or three common men, who are always burnt, though tho&s;e whom they replace have died of di&s;ea&s;e. The Irroquois never fail to &s;et apart &s;ome of their pri|&s;oners for the publick; and the&s;e the council di&s;po&s;e of as they plea&s;e. But mothers of families among them, may &s;till &s;et a&s;ide their &s;entence, and are the mi&s;tre&s;&s;es
<PB N="257" REF="268">
of life and death, even of tho&s;e who have been con|demned or pardoned by the council.</P>
<P>In general, the greate&s;t number of the pri&s;oners of war, are condemned to die, or to very hard &s;lavery, in which their lives are never &s;ecure. Some are adopted, as I have ob&s;erved, and, from that time, their condition differs nothing from that of the children of the nation. They enter into all the rights of tho&s;e who&s;e places they &s;upply; and they often acquire &s;o far the &s;pirit of the nation, of which they are become members, that they make no difficulty afterwards of going to war again&s;t their own countrymen. The Irroquois would &s;carce have &s;upported them&s;elves hitherto, but by this policy. Having been at war many years again&s;t all the other nations, they would at pre&s;ent have been reduced almo&s;t to nothing, had they not taken great care to naturalize a good part of their pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>Sometimes it happens, that in&s;tead of &s;ending the &s;ur|plus of the&s;e captives into other villages, they give them to private per&s;ons who had not a&s;ked for any; and they &s;erve the&s;e per&s;ons as &s;laves. Adopted pri&s;oners are treated with great tenderne&s;s; their wounds, if they have any, are dre&s;&s;ed and healed; they live well, are cloathed decently, and nothing omitted to make them forget their &s;ufferings. They call the&s;e adopted pri&s;oners, men "rai&s;ed from the dead;" and give them the name of the per&s;on whom they re-place.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="269">Among&s;t the Hurons and Irroquois, tho&s;e pri&s;oners, whom they intend to burn, are &s;ometimes as well treated at fir&s;t, and even till the moment of their execution, as tho&s;e that have been adopted; like victims fattened for a &s;acrifice to the god of war. The only difference made between them is, that they blacken the faces all over of tho&s;e they de&s;ign to burn. After this they entertain them in the be&s;t manner, &s;peak kindly to them, call them by the tender names of &s;on, brother, or nephew, according to the per&s;on who&s;e manes they mean to appea&s;e by their death: Nay, they will often give them young women to &s;erve them as wives, all the time they have to live. But when they are informed of their fate, they are clo&s;e kept to prevent their e&s;caping.</P>
<P>When they are delivered to a woman, the mo|ment they inform her every thing is ready for execu|tion, &s;he is no longer a mother, but a fury, who pa&s;&s;es from the tendere&s;t care&s;&s;es, to the greate&s;t paroxy&s;ms of rage. She begins by invoking the &s;pirit of him &s;he de|&s;ires to revenge. "Approach," &s;ays &s;he, "you are going to be appea&s;ed; I prepare a fea&s;t for thee; drink great draughts of this broth, which is going to be poured out for thee. Receive the &s;acrifice I make; this warrior &s;hall be burnt and put into the kettle; they &s;hall apply red hot hatchets to his fle&s;h; they &s;hall tear off his &s;calp, they &s;hall drink in his &s;cull; make therefore no more complaints; thou &s;halt be fully &s;atisfied." This form of &s;peech, which is properly the &s;entence of death,
<PB N="259" REF="270">
varies as to terms, but the meaning is always much the &s;ame. A cryer now makes the captive come from the cabin, and declares aloud the intention of him or her to whom he belongs, and fini&s;hes by exhorting the young people to behave well. Another cryer &s;ucceeds, and ad|dre&s;&s;ing him that is to &s;uffer, &s;ays, "Brother, take cou|rage, thou art going to be burnt." And he an&s;wers coolly, "That is well, I give thee thanks." Immediately there is a cry throughout the village, and the pri&s;oner is led to the &s;take, where he is tied, but &s;o that he can run round it. Sometimes when the execution is made in a cabin, from whence there is no danger of e&s;caping, he is &s;uffered to run from one end to another. Before they begin to burn him, he &s;ings, for the la&s;t time, his death-&s;ong, reciting his atchievements, and almo&s;t always in a manner the mo&s;t in&s;ulting to tho&s;e about him; he next exhorts them not to &s;pare him, but to remember that he is a man and a warrior.</P>
<P>I will not relate all the particulars, that pa&s;s in the&s;e horrible executions. There are generally as many actors as &s;pectators, men, women, and children, who &s;tudy to encrea&s;e his &s;ufferings and prolong his exi&s;tence; and the &s;ufferer, in&s;tead of &s;hewing any fear, or &s;igns of pain, glories in the torments he undergoes, in&s;ults his per&s;ecu|tors to his la&s;t breath, and dies, as it were, in a &s;tate of triumph. There is a haughtine&s;s in heart in the&s;e &s;ava|ges, that elevates the &s;pirits, and tran&s;ports the man in the mid&s;t of tortures, which, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, takes off
<PB N="260" REF="271">
the edge of pain, by diverting the thoughts. In &s;hort, where there are no hopes of mercy, de&s;pair gives re&s;olu|tion, and in&s;pires boldne&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Umfreville</HI> tells us, that the Hud&s;on's Bay Com|pany being informed, that the Indians frequently brought fine pieces of copper to their &s;ettlements in Churchill river, appointed a per&s;on, with proper a&s;&s;i&s;tants, to ex|amine the river where this valuable acqui&s;ition was &s;up|po&s;ed to be concealed. That per&s;on gives the following account of his expedition; which will de&s;cribe the Indian method of going to war in this part of the country. "In latitude 62 degrees, 57 minutes north, and 18 degrees we&s;t longitude, from Churchill river," &s;ays he, "we built our canoes in 1771; where many northern Indians joined us, and finding we were intended for the copper-mine river that &s;ummer, between 70 and 80 &s;tout fellows agreed to accompany us, with no other intent then to kill the E&s;quimaux. I u&s;ed my be&s;t endeavours to per&s;uade them from this de&s;ign, but to no purpo&s;e; for, in&s;tead of my advice having the de&s;ired effect, they imputed it to cowardice; that being a character I always de&s;pi&s;ed, I was obliged to &s;um up my be&s;t endeavours, to retrieve my then fading honour, and told them, I cared not if they made the name of an E&s;quimaux extinct; and though I was no enemy to them, yet, if I found it nece&s;&s;ary for my own &s;afety, or for the &s;afety of tho&s;e who were with me, I &s;hould not be afraid of an E&s;quimaux. This declaration cau&s;ed great &s;houts of &s;atisfaction. They then
<PB N="261" REF="272">
began to prepare their targets, or &s;hields, which are made of boards three feet long, two broad, and three-fourths of an inch thick, and &s;o &s;lung on the left arm, as to be of no hindrance in loading and firing their guns.</P>
<P>"Our war implements being all ready, we &s;et out on our expedition; and, by the 21&s;t of June, were in latitude 68 degrees, 54 minutes north, and 22 degrees 21 minutes we&s;t, from Churchill. Here we agreed to leave all the women and every other incumbrance. Accordingly, after &s;taying a few days, to kill as many deer and buffa|loes as would &s;erve them till our return, we proceeded again, and we arrived at the copper-river on the 13th of July, and, as I found afterwards, about 40 miles from its entrance. On our arrival, the Indians di&s;patched three men before as &s;pies, to &s;ee if any E&s;quimaux were tent|ing about the river. On the 15th of the &s;ame month, as I was continuing my &s;urvey towards the mouth of the river, we met the three &s;pies above-mentioned, who in|formed us of five tents of E&s;quimaux being on the we&s;t &s;ide of the river, and, by their compari&s;on of the di&s;tance, I judged it to be about twelve miles off. On their receiving this news, they would pay no more atten|tion to my &s;urvey, but their whole thoughts were imme|diately engaged in planning the be&s;t method how to &s;teal on them in the night, and kill them while a&s;leep. After having all their apparatus ready for the en&s;uing &s;laughter, they began to invoke their different patronizing agents by the following &s;uper&s;tition: All the men painted the front
<PB N="262" REF="273">
of their targets; &s;ome with the image of the &s;un, others with the moon, others with different kinds of birds and bea&s;ts of prey, and &s;ome with the images of imaginary furies, which, according to their &s;illy imaginations, in|habit the elements. By &s;trict enquiry into the cau&s;e of this &s;uper&s;tition, I found that each man had the image of that agent painted on his target, which he re|lied on for &s;ucce&s;s in the en&s;uing enterprize. Some were contented with a &s;ingle repre&s;entation, while others (doubtful of the quality of any &s;ingle being) would have their targets covered to the very margin, with a group of hieroglyphics quite unintelligible. This piece of &s;uper&s;tition being compleated, we then began to advance towards the E&s;quimaux. The number of our company being &s;o far &s;uperior to the five tents of E&s;quimaux, por|tended no le&s;s than a total ma&s;&s;acre, unle&s;s kind Provi|dence &s;hould work a miracle in their favour. It was about ten o'clock in the morning when they made their attack upon their unhappy enemies, whom they found fa&s;t a&s;leep. In a few minutes the havock was be|gun, my&s;elf &s;tanding neuter in the rear. Pre&s;ently, a &s;cene, truly &s;hocking, pre&s;ented it&s;elf to my view; for, as the E&s;quimaux were &s;urprized at a time when they thought them&s;elves in the mid&s;t of &s;ecurity, they had neither power nor time to make any re&s;i&s;tance. Men, women, and children, ran out of the tents, &s;tark-naked; but where could they fly for &s;helter? They &s;oon fell a &s;acrifice to Indian fury. The &s;hrieks and groans of the expiring were truly horrible; and it was much increa&s;ed
<PB N="263" REF="274">
by the &s;ight of a young girl, about 18 years old, whom they killed &s;o near me, that when the fir&s;t &s;pear was through her, &s;he fell down and twi&s;ted her&s;elf about my legs; and it was &s;ome difficulty for me to di&s;engage my|&s;elf from her dying gra&s;ps. As the Indians pur&s;ued her, I &s;olicited for her life; but this was &s;o far from being granted, that I was not fully a&s;&s;ured of my own being en|tirely in &s;afety, for offering to &s;peak in her behalf. When I begged her life, the fellows made no reply, till they had both their &s;pears through her, and fixed into the ground. They then looked &s;ternly in my face, and began to upbraid me, a&s;king me, if I wanted an E&s;quimaux wife; at the &s;ame time paying no regard to the &s;hrieks of the poor girl, who was then turning about the &s;pears like an eel; indeed, I was obliged at la&s;t to reque&s;t them to be more expeditious in di&s;patching her out of her mi&s;ery, otherwi&s;e I &s;hould be obliged, in pity, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in that friendly office, by putting an end to a life &s;o mortally wounded. When this horrid work was compleated, we ob&s;erved &s;even more tents on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river, the people belonging to them appeared to be in great confu&s;ion, but did not offer to make their e&s;cape; the Indians fired many &s;hots at them, acro&s;s the river, but the poor E&s;quimaux were &s;o unacquainted with the nature of guns, that when the bullets &s;truck the rocks, they ran in crowds to &s;ee what was &s;ent them, and &s;eemed curious in examining the pieces of lead they found flat|tened on the rocks, till at la&s;t one man was &s;hot through the calf of the leg; after which they immediately em|barked
<PB N="264" REF="275">
in their canoes, with their wives and children, and paddled to a &s;hoal in the river. After the invaders had killed every &s;oul they could get at, they began break|ing the &s;tone-kettles, and copper-work, which the E&s;|quimaux made u&s;e of, in&s;tead of iron; and when they had plundered their tents of every thing worth their notice, they threw the tent-poles into the river; where, finding an old woman &s;pearing of &s;almon, every man thru&s;ted his &s;pear into her, and barbarou&s;ly butchered her."</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> On the Hud&s;on-Bay Trade.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING frequently mentioned this company, the reader will, I tru&s;t, not be di&s;plea&s;ed at having &s;ome little account of it, and its trade with the Indians of North America.</P>
<P>Though this company has been chartered &s;ince the year 1678, and enjoy an exclu&s;ive right of trading throughout all the country round Hud&s;on's-Bay, indefi|nitely to the we&s;tward, whether explored or unexplored, the number of proprietors in 1749 were only 97, and their &s;tock amounted to no more than 103,000<HI>l.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="276">They have &s;ix &s;ettlements in the Bay, between north latitude 51 and 59, and we&s;t longitude from London 78 to 93. In the&s;e &s;ix &s;ettlements they have but 240 people, and employ but two &s;hips, and a &s;loop to take out &s;undry articles of merchandize, and bring home peltries, or &s;kins. The burden of the&s;e three ve&s;&s;els fall &s;hort of &s;ix hundred tons, having on board about 75 men, who, with the 240 re&s;iding in the country, make the whole number in their employ 315. Be&s;ides &s;kins, they bring home a little ivory, whale-oil, and a &s;mall quantity of goo&s;e-feathers for beds, and goo&s;e-quills; and take out Briti&s;h &s;pirits, and &s;undry trifling articles, of little or no value. A gallon of &s;pirits, which co&s;ts the company 20<HI>d.</HI> will purcha&s;e of the Indians eight beaver-&s;kins, worth 6<HI>l.</HI> &s;terling, and a four-penny comb will barter for a bear's &s;kin, worth 40<HI>s.</HI> &s;terling. It is a pity government &s;hould not put an end to this exclu|&s;ive trade, which at pre&s;ent is &s;o trifling an object to them, the annual returns not exceeding 30,000<HI>l.</HI> and which might, by being at large, be productive of great advantages.</P>
<P>The Canadian merchants have formed them&s;elves into an united company, and carry on a very exten&s;ive bu&s;ine&s;s over an unlimited extent of country among Indians, who are declared enemies to each other. This company alone, without reckoning the&s;e adventurers, who trade in the parts adjacent to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, annually procure 1,000 packs of fine peltry, weighing 90lb. each, worth 12<HI>s.</HI> a
<PB N="266" REF="277">
pound, whereas the Hud&s;on's-Bay Company do not im|port into England one-fourth of the quantity.</P>
<P>I will clo&s;e this account with Mr. <HI>Umfreville</HI>'s de&s;crip|tion of the ravages which the &s;mall-pox made among the Indians, in the years 1781 and 1782, when an almo&s;t uni|ver&s;al mortality &s;pread it&s;elf throughout the country, in the interior part of Hud&s;on's-Bay, extending its de&s;truc|tive effects through every tribe and nation, &s;paring nei|ther age nor &s;ex.</P>
<P>The di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the Indians, by this vi&s;itation, demands pity from every humane per&s;on. As the &s;mall-pox had never before been among them, and they were utter &s;trangers to its malignity, they were not much alarmed at its fir&s;t appearance. Numbers, however, began to die on every &s;ide. The infection &s;pread rapidly, and hundreds lay expiring, without a&s;&s;i&s;tance, without courage, or the lea&s;t hopes of recovery; for, when an Indian finds him&s;elf &s;ick, he re&s;igns him&s;elf up to a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ible &s;tupefaction. And as the uncertainty of a &s;avage life is &s;uch, that one day he &s;hall be exulting in the mid&s;t of plenty, and the next pining under the mi&s;ery of want, they were now deprived of all manner of &s;upport.</P>
<P>Without the lea&s;t medicinal help, or that common aid which their ca&s;e required, a prey to hunger and di&s;ea&s;e, the&s;e forlorn Indians lay expiring in their tents, under the accumulated weight of every &s;courge which
<PB N="267" REF="278">
human nature can experience. Wolves, and other wild bea&s;ts, infe&s;ted and entered their habitations, and dragged them out, whil&s;t life yet remained, to devour their mi&s;erable, morbid carca&s;es: even their faithful dogs, worn out with hunger, joined the ferocious wolves in their unnatural depredation. Heads, legs, and arms, lay indi&s;criminately &s;cattered about, as food for the birds of the air, and the bea&s;ts of the mountains; and as none were buried, the very air became infectious, and tended to waft about the baneful contagion. Such has been the fate of many of the tribes inhabiting the&s;e parts, and which has nearly terminated in their extinction.</P>

It was called New Albion by Sir Francis Drake, who, in his &s;econd voyage round the world, touched at this country in 1577; but the mo&s;t ancient name, and that by which it is be&s;t known, is California, and &s;uch we &s;hall call it.</P>
<P>It is now known that this country is not an i&s;land but a penin&s;ula, joined to the continent of America, in the mo&s;t northern part di&s;covered by the Spaniards, in the South Sea, or Pacific Ocean. It is a large point of land, i&s;&s;uing from the north coa&s;t of America, and ex|tending
<PB N="269" REF="280">
to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, wa&s;hed, on both &s;ides, by the Pacific Sea, beyond the tropics, &s;o that the &s;outh point of it lies in the Torrid Zone, and nearly oppo&s;ite to the pro|vince of Guadalaxara, on which it depends. The we&s;t|ern coa&s;t of California runs to the &s;outhward, extending 22 degrees to Cape Blanco de San Seba&s;tian, and the ea&s;tern or inward coa&s;t, on an accurate examination, ap|pears to reach ten degrees, till it meets with the great river Colorado. Between the&s;e two coa&s;ts is the pe|nin&s;ula of California; and the arm of the &s;ea between the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of the penin&s;ula and the continent, is called the Gulph or Bay of California, and is in &s;ome places 40, &s;ome 50, and &s;ome 60 leagues broad. Into the upper end of this gulph, the great river Colorado di&s;|charges its waters. This river lies between 44 and 22 degrees of north latitude. Ellis places Cape Blanco in 124 degrees we&s;t longitude from London, which is equal to 144 degrees of the common longitude.</P>
<P>Of all the rivers in the va&s;t extent of the vice-royalty of Mexico, Colorado is the large&s;t, its mouth at its en|trance into the gulph being near a league wide, and ly|ing in north latitude 32 degrees 30 minutes, it runs di|rectly north and &s;outh, from the 34th degree till it lo&s;es it&s;elf in the &s;ea.</P>
<P>Till the beginning of this century, no European had penetrated into the inland parts of California, of cour&s;e any accounts given of it cannot be relied on. The limits
<PB N="270" REF="281">
already &s;ubdued by Spain, are about 300 leagues north from Cape San Lucas, which is &s;ituated in the mo&s;t &s;outhern point. Its breadth, within the&s;e limits, from &s;ea to &s;ea, is, in &s;ome places, 40 leagues wide, &s;ome 30, &s;ome 20, and in &s;ome only 10 leagues.</P>
<P>The air is in general dry and hot to a great degree, and the earth barren, rugged, and wild, every where over-run with mountains, rocks, and &s;ands, with little water; con&s;equently unfit either for agriculture, plant|ing, or grazing. Keno, who cro&s;&s;ed the river Colorado, between 34 and 35 degrees, and took a very careful &s;urvey of the countries to the we&s;t of this river, a&s;&s;ures us, that there are level and fruitful tracts, inter&s;per&s;ed with many delightful woods, plenty of water, fine pa&s;|tures, and as proper a country for making &s;ettlements as can be de&s;ired: the idea therefore of barrenne&s;s is not to be extended beyond the 32d degree north. Indeed, though I have &s;aid generally, that the penin&s;ula is barren, I would by no means infer, that it is univer&s;ally &s;o; it is not without plains, here and there, both for pa&s;ture and tillage, and even in the centre of California, there are &s;ome vallies and ri&s;ing grounds of a tolerable &s;oil, having &s;prings for drinking, and watering the grounds. In the&s;e parts it is, that the poor Californians have their dwellings; and here likewi&s;e are the Cabeceras of the Mi&s;&s;ions, that is, the principal towns where the Mi&s;&s;ionary u&s;ually re&s;ides, and the villages within their vi&s;itation. But along the whole inward coa&s;t, from Cape San Lucas
<PB N="271" REF="282">
to the river Colorado, there are only two &s;treams, and the&s;e but &s;mall. On both &s;ides the river Santo Thom&eacute;, which ri&s;es between 26 and 27 degrees of north latitude, and, after cro&s;&s;ing the whole penin&s;ula, empties it&s;elf into the South Sea, at 26 degrees; forming, at its mouth, a large harbour: I &s;ay, on both &s;ides of this river are chri&s;tian villiages.</P>
<P>In California are now found all kinds of dome&s;tic animals, commonly u&s;ed in Spain and Mexico; hor&s;es, mules, a&s;&s;es, oxen, &s;heep, hogs, goats, dogs, and cats. They have been imported from New Spain, and thrive here very well: but here are two &s;pecies of wild animals, not known in Old or New Spain, The fir&s;t is that which the Californians call <HI>Taye;</HI> it is about the &s;ize of a calf, a year and a half old, and greatly re&s;embles it in figure, except in its head, which is like that of a deer, with very thick horns like a ram; its hoof is large, round, and clo|ven, like that of an ox; its &s;kin is &s;potted like a deer, but the hair thinner, and it has a &s;hort tail like a deer; the fle&s;h is very palatable, and, to &s;ome, ta&s;tes delicious. The other animal peculiar to this country is the <HI>Cayot&eacute;,</HI> or wild dog, very much re&s;embling a fox. Here are al&s;o leopards, &s;uch as they call lions in Mexico; goats, cats, and wild hogs, are frequently found in the moun|tains, and <HI>Torquemada</HI> ob&s;erves, that, about Mont&eacute;-Rey are very large bears, tigers, an animal &s;omething like a buffalo, and a creature which he thus de&s;cribes: It is about the &s;ize of a &s;teer, but &s;haped like a &s;tag; its hair re&s;embles that of a pelican, and is a quarter of a
<PB N="272" REF="283">
yard in length; its neck long; and on its head are horns, like tho&s;e of a &s;tag; the tail is a yard long, and half a yard broad; and its feet cloven, like the feet of an ox.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to reptiles and in&s;ects, be&s;ides the com|mon ones, here are al&s;o tho&s;e which u&s;ually abound in hot countries, as vipers, efts, &s;corpions, lizards, &amp;c. but no bugs, and other mi&s;chievous in&s;ects, &s;o common to America.</P>
<P>Of birds, there are an infinite variety. Among the&s;e, for the table, are turtle-doves, herons, quails, phea&s;ants, gee&s;e, ducks, and pidgeons. The birds of prey are vultures, hawks, falcons, o&s;&s;iphrages, horn-owls, ravens, and crows. Of night-birds, there are owls, and many others of a &s;maller kind, not &s;een in other parts, nor men|tioned by any naturali&s;ts; nor have the narratives of the Je&s;uits &s;upplied us with a de&s;cription, or even with the names of them. California has a great variety of &s;ing|ing-birds, as larks, nightingales, and the like, adorned with beautiful plumages. <HI>Torquemada</HI> &s;ays, that about the harbour of Mont&eacute;-Rey are bu&s;tards, peacocks, gee&s;e, thru&s;hes, &s;wallows, &s;parrows, goldfinches, linnets, quails, partridges, blackbirds, water-wagtails, cranes, and other birds re&s;embling turkey-cocks, &s;o large as to be 17 palms from the extremity of one wing to that of the other; and al&s;o a particular &s;pecies of gulls, that live on pilchards and other fi&s;h, equal in &s;ize to a very large
<PB N="273" REF="284">
goo&s;e, their bill a foot long, with long legs re&s;embling a &s;tork, their beak and feet like tho&s;e of a goo&s;e. They have a va&s;t craw, which in &s;ome hangs down like the leather bottles u&s;ed in Peru for carrying water, in which craws they carry what they catch to their young ones. The friendly di&s;po&s;ition of the&s;e birds is &s;omething &s;ur|prizing, for they a&s;&s;i&s;t one another when &s;ick or wounded, and bring that bird provi&s;ion that is unable to &s;earch for it. The Indians profit by this; for, when they want a di&s;h of fi&s;h, they will wound and tie a gull to a particu|lar &s;pot, conceal them&s;elves, and, when they think all the provi&s;ion is brought them which other gulls de&s;igned, they advance and &s;eize the contribution: &s;uch are the my&s;terious ways of Providence for the &s;upport of his creatures!</P>
<P>There is very little timber in this country, and the mountains all over this va&s;t tract are totally bare of ver|dure, or, at mo&s;t, only covered with &s;mall &s;hrubs, briars, and low trees; but many of them have excellent fruit, &s;ome common to Europe, and others peculiar to Ame|rica.</P>
<P>But among the plants and &s;hrubs which mo&s;t abound in California, the principal is the <HI>Pitahaga,</HI> a kind of beech, the fruit of which forms the great harve&s;t of the poor inhabitants here. This tree is not known in Europe, and differs from all other trees in the world; its branches are fluted, and ri&s;e vertically from the &s;tem,
<PB N="274" REF="285">
&s;o as to form a very beautiful top; they are without leaves, the fruit growing to the boughs. The fruit is like a hor&s;e che&s;nut, and full of prickles, but the pulp re|&s;embles that of a &s;ig, only more &s;oft and lu&s;cious. In &s;ome it is white, in &s;ome red, and in others yellow, but always of an exqui&s;ite ta&s;te; &s;ome again are wholly &s;weet; others of a grateful acid; but its mo&s;t valuable quality is its being a &s;pecific again&s;t the di&s;temper <HI>de Loanda.</HI> There is al&s;o a plumb-tree here, that, in&s;tead of re&s;in or gum, throws out a very fine and fragrant incen&s;e, in &s;uch quan|tities that they mix it with tallow for paying the bottoms of &s;hips. Every kind of fruit-tree, and all kinds of e&s;culent roots and herbs growing in New Spain, have been brought here, and have &s;ucceeded well.</P>
<P>It is not ab&s;olutely a&s;certained, what kind of minerals are produced in California, but it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that there are many rich mines, as the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t in the provinces of Lonora and Pimeria are known to abound with them; for in the year 1730, a vein was di&s;covered on an eminence, not far from the garri&s;on of Pimeria, the ore of which, with a little labour, yielded &s;o large a quantity of &s;ilver as &s;urprized the inhabitants of New Spain; and it remained &s;ome time a que&s;tion, whether it was a mine or trea&s;ures hid by the Indians. Some have al&s;o been di&s;covered which contain veins of other metals. Rock-&s;alt is al&s;o found here of a white|ne&s;s equal to cry&s;tal, and &s;amples of it have been car|ried to Mexico.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="286">But if the &s;oil of California is in general barren, the &s;carcity of provi&s;ions is &s;upplied by the adjacent &s;ea; for both in the Pacific Ocean, and in the Gulf of California, the multitude and variety of fi&s;hes are incredible.</P>
<P>Of the amphibious kind, there are a &s;pecies of beaver, and &s;ome few &s;ea lions, that frequent the de&s;ert i&s;lands of both &s;eas. Of the te&s;taceous kind, the mo&s;t remarkable is the tortoi&s;e. On the South-&s;ea coa&s;t are &s;ome &s;mall conches peculiar to it, and perhaps the mo&s;t beautiful in the world; the lu&s;tre exceeding that of the fine&s;t mother-of-pearl, and appearing through a tran|&s;parent varni&s;h of a mo&s;t vivid blue, like the lapis lazuli. It is thought, that if the&s;e were imported into Europe, the aqua marina would no longer be valued. The&s;e are univalves, and con&s;equently different from the &s;hell-fi&s;h in which the pearls are found, the latter being bi|valves, like our oy&s;ters; the&s;e la&s;t lie &s;o thick along the whole coa&s;t, that they may be counted by thou&s;ands. They are called <HI>Madras perlas,</HI> and their abundance has rendered California &s;o famous, that great numbers of per|&s;ons, during the la&s;t two centuries, have vi&s;ited this place, and &s;earched every part of the gulph merely with a view of enriching them&s;elves by the&s;e pearls. The &s;ea of California, &s;ays <HI>Torquemada,</HI> affords very rich pearl-fi&s;heries, where, in three or four fathom water, the <HI>ho&s;tias,</HI> or beds of oy&s;ters, may be &s;een as plain as if they were on the &s;urface of the water. This fi&s;hery is carried on by divers; but, as the water in the gulph is
<PB N="276" REF="287">
not very deep, it is attended with le&s;s labour and danger than tho&s;e on the coa&s;t of Malabar, and other parts of the Ea&s;t-Indies. Great numbers re&s;ort to this fi&s;hery, from New Spain, New Galicia, Culiacan, Cinaloa, and Sonora.</P>
<P>Father Piccolo ob&s;erves, that, in the months of April, May, and June, there falls with the dew a kind of manna, which becomes in&s;pi&s;ated on the leaves of the trees, and which has all the &s;weetne&s;s of &s;ugar, though not &s;o white. This good father talks, according to the common opinion, as if this manna dropped from Heaven; but botani&s;ts are agreed, that it is a juice ex&s;udating from the plants them&s;elves, as gums, incen&s;e, bal&s;ams, and re&s;ins do. It is no wonder that the trees of Cali|fornia &s;hould ex&s;udate manna, &s;ince many parts of Spain produce it in an a&s;toni&s;hing plenty, and for medical u&s;es equal to that of Calabria, or Sicily. Among the moun|tains of Avila, and the P&eacute;deroch&eacute;s, or &s;even towns of Cordova, &s;ituated among the mountains of Andalu&s;ia, and other parts, there is as much manna produced, about the dog-days, as is &s;ufficient to &s;upply the whole world, which, till the year 1752, was not noticed, but was u&s;ed only by the bees in forming their combs; but in the year ju&s;t mentioned, on the repre&s;entation of the Royal College of Phy&s;icians at Madrid, the king gave orders that two of its members &s;hould examine into the qua|lities of this drug, and its efficacy be experimentally proved by exhibiting it to the patients in the ho&s;pitals.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of the People, Government, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the nations hitherto di&s;covered, the Califor|nians are at lea&s;t equal to any in the make of their bodies; their faces are al&s;o far from di&s;agreeable, though their daubing them with ointments, painting them, and boring holes through their no&s;trils and ears, are very great di&s;advantages; their complexion, indeed, is more tanned and &s;warthy than that of the other Indians of New Spain; but they are in general robu&s;t, vigorous, and of a healthy countenance.</P>
<P>There are three nations of Indians in California, who &s;peak three different languages; but the dre&s;s throughout the whole penin&s;ula is uniform; for males, whether children or adults, go at all times totally naked. But amid&s;t this naked &s;imiliarity there is &s;ome diver&s;ity in the ornaments u&s;ed by every nation. In the &s;outhern parts the people decorate their heads with &s;trings of pearl, braided with their hair; with the&s;e they interweave &s;mall feathers, the whole forming an ornament, which, at a di&s;tance, re&s;embles a periwig. The nation of Loretto generally wear round their wai&s;t a becoming girdle, and on their forehead a curious fillet of net-work; to the&s;e &s;ome add a neck-cloth, with &s;ome well-wrought figures
<PB N="278" REF="289">
of nacar, and &s;ometimes &s;ome &s;mall round fruits, like beads, which in &s;ome mea&s;ure re&s;emble a ro&s;ary, hang|ing on their brea&s;t; they al&s;o adorn their arms with bracelets of the &s;ame works. The Cochines of the north u&s;ually keep their hair &s;hort, a few only excepted, who &s;uffer it to hang down upon their &s;houlders. If they do not u&s;e pearls, like tho&s;e of the &s;outh, they have a more &s;plendid ornament, a kind of diadem, or crown, formed of &s;everal bands of nacar. To compo&s;e this, they fir&s;t detach the mother of pearl from the &s;hell, give it a fine poli&s;h on both &s;ides, and, by means of a &s;lint, divide it into &s;mall pieces, in which they bore holes to &s;tring them. When one of the&s;e Indians offered Sir Francis Drake &s;uch a diadem or head dre&s;s, he conceived they offered him the crown and &s;ceptre of California.</P>
<P>Though the women in &s;ome parts go naked as the men, yet, in general, they &s;hew a great attention to that decency, which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the defence of their virtue, and to &s;uch a degree that even infant girls are not without a proper covering. Towards Cape San Lucas is a certain &s;pecies of palm-trees, different from tho&s;e which produce dates, and from the&s;e the Indian women procure materials for their petticoats: in order to which they beat it, as we do flax, till the threads or filaments are &s;eparated. Their garments con&s;i&s;t of three pieces, two of which form a petticoat, reaching from the girdle to the feet, and the third a &s;hort cloak, or mantlet, which covers the body from the &s;houlders: the&s;e pieces are
<PB N="279" REF="290">
not woven, and the threads are fa&s;tened at the top with one another, as in fringes, and hang down in very clo&s;e and thick &s;kains and tufts; and though they make a &s;ort of linen of the&s;e jutas or palm-threads, they only u&s;e it for bags in which they keep their in&s;truments. The Indian women of Cape San Lucas wear their hair long, loo&s;e, and &s;pread on their &s;houlders; but their head-dre&s;s is the &s;ame with that generally worn by all the women of California. It con&s;i&s;ts of a piece of net-work, made with &s;uch ingenuity, that the &s;oldiers of the garri&s;ons likewi&s;e u&s;e them.</P>
<P>The women of the northern parts wear a different and a meaner garment, being covered only from the wai&s;t to the knees. Before, they wear a petticoat made of very thin pieces of &s;edge, cut off at the knots, and about the &s;ize of a &s;traw. The&s;e they fa&s;ten together with threads, and barely &s;erve to hide tho&s;e parts which nature has taught them to conceal, but does not defend them from the inclemencies of the weather. In &s;ome few places, it is the cu&s;tom to cover their bodies with cloaks, made with the &s;kins of wild bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>One of the highe&s;t fe&s;tivals among the Cochines, is the day in which they annually di&s;tribute the &s;kins to the women. All the neighbouring rancherias, or villages, meet at an appointed place, and there, with branches of trees, and bu&s;hes, erect a &s;pacious arbour, from which they clear a broad and level way for racers. Here they
<PB N="280" REF="291">
bring the &s;kins of all the bea&s;ts they have killed that year, and lay them as a carpet along the cour&s;e. None but the chiefs are admitted into the arbour; and when the banquet, which con&s;i&s;ts of game, fi&s;h, and fruit, is over, they intoxicate them&s;elves with cimarron, or wild tobacco. At the entrance of the arbour a &s;orcerer takes his place, dre&s;&s;ed in the habit of ceremony, and, with wild vociferations, proclaims the prai&s;es of the hunters. In the mean time, the other Indians run to and fro, in a frantic manner, on the &s;kins; whil&s;t the women, who a&s;&s;i&s;t at this cere|mony, &s;ing and dance with equal tran&s;port. This con|tinues till the orator is quite &s;pent, when the harangue concludes, and with it the races. The chiefs then come out of the arbour, and di&s;tribute to the women the &s;kins for their cloathing that year; and this di&s;tribution is cele|brated with fre&s;h rejoicings. The foundation of all this fe&s;tivity was, that the&s;e poor women were acquainted with no greater ornament than the &s;kin of a deer, though it &s;carcely covered their nakedne&s;s, with any tolerable degree of mode&s;ty.</P>
<P>The men, however, were, and are &s;uch &s;trangers to that virtue, that they con&s;ider tho&s;e principles as igno|minious and di&s;graceful, which require their being cloathed; and, accordingly, when any of the mi&s;&s;ionaries, or &s;oldiers, offer them cloaths, they either refu&s;e them, or throw them away. Indeed their ideas, with regard to cloathing, is &s;o different from the re&s;t of the human
<PB N="281" REF="292">
&s;pecies, that, Father <HI>Salva Tierra</HI> tells us, they were highly affronted when he fir&s;t directed them to cover at lea&s;t what mode&s;ty requires, not being in the lea&s;t &s;en&s;ible of any indecency from their being naked; and it cau&s;ed as much laughter to &s;ee one of their own coun|trymen cloathed, as a monkey, dre&s;&s;ed like an officer, would among us, of which he had a diverting in&s;tance.</P>
<P>A mi&s;&s;ionary, on his arrival at his mi&s;&s;ion, cloathed two little boys, which he entertained in his hou&s;e, fir&s;t to teach them the language, and afterwards to &s;erve him as catechumens. The Father him&s;elf was at the pains of cutting out, making, and fitting the cloaths for them. When the lads fir&s;t went abroad in their new dre&s;s, it occa&s;ioned &s;uch indecent mirth, that the boys, a&s;hamed at being thus the ridicule of their countrymen, pulled off their cloaths, and hung them on a tree. But being un|willing to &s;hew them&s;elves ungrateful to the Father, and at the &s;ame time to avoid being reprimanded, they de|termined to divide his kindne&s;s, going in the day-time naked among their relations, and at night dre&s;&s;ing them|&s;elves to return to the Father.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es of the Californians make no better appear|ance than their habits. Tho&s;e of every rancheria, or village, are merely wretched huts, &s;ituated near the few waters found in this country; and as there is a nece&s;&s;ity of removing to other places in que&s;t of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, they ea&s;ily &s;hift their &s;tation. Wherever they &s;top, they
<PB N="282" REF="293">
&s;helter them&s;elves under the trees, from the &s;corching heat of the &s;un by day, and the coldne&s;s and incle|mency of the weather by night. In &s;evere winters they live in caverns, which they either dig them&s;elves, or find in the &s;ides of mountains. Their hou&s;es are but a &s;mall &s;pace, enclo&s;ed with &s;tones, laid one upon another, half a yard high, are &s;quare, and without any covering but the heavens; dwellings, indeed, &s;o &s;canty and mean, that an European tomb would be here reckoned a palace. For, within this &s;mall precinct, not having room to lie at full length, they &s;leep in a &s;itting po&s;ture. The mi&s;|&s;ionaries have erected hou&s;es for them, with unburnt bricks, covered with &s;edge, but there &s;eems no po&s;&s;ibi|lity of bringing them to live in them, for they &s;hew the greate&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s at being under any covering: a proof, that the greate&s;t part of what are called the nece&s;&s;aries of life, ari&s;e purely from fancy, example, and cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>It is true, they &s;tand in no need of large rooms for depo&s;iting their furniture, and the various articles of a wardrobe, with which the greate&s;t part of our hou&s;es is taken up. With &s;o little furniture, and &s;o few uten&s;ils do the Indians content them&s;elves, that, in removing, they carry all on their back; for they con&s;i&s;t only of a boat, a dart, a di&s;h, a bowl, made in the &s;hape of a high-crowned hat, a bone, which &s;erves them for an awl in making it, a little piece of touchwood for kindling a fire, a pitahaya-net, in which they put their fruit and
<PB N="283" REF="294">
&s;eeds; another in the &s;hape of a pur&s;e, or bag, fa&s;tened to a kind of prong acro&s;s their &s;houlders, in which they carry their children; and, la&s;tly, their bow and arrows, to which &s;ome, who affect elegance, add a &s;hell for drinking. Tho&s;e who live near the coa&s;t, have al&s;o nets for fi&s;hing. This furniture the women carry; the men burthen them&s;elves only with their bows and arrows, and the materials to repair them. The&s;e ma|terials are flints, and feathers for the arrows, and nerves for bow-&s;trings, which, not to incommode them in travelling, they carry in a large ca&s;e, which they hang to their ears, by boring a hole through them. The men al&s;o carry a &s;mall bit of wood for procuring fire, which is &s;oon done by rubbing it between their hands. They like|wi&s;e carry their boats, which are made of the bark of trees, and which it is the province of the women to repair. Every part of their boats is &s;o curiou&s;ly made, as to be admired by Europeans. They often fetch and and keep water in the&s;e boats. It is the bu&s;ine&s;s of the men to make the nets; and in this they &s;hew exqui&s;ite &s;kill, making them of &s;o many different colours, &s;izes, and &s;uch a variety of workman&s;hip, that it is not ea&s;y to de&s;cribe them; no nets made in Europe being in any re&s;pect equal to them, either for beauty, &s;trength, or fini&s;hing.</P>
<P>The Californians admit of a plurality of wives, who provide for the family, and are diligent in bringing their hu&s;band a &s;ufficient quantity of fruits from the fore&s;t, to

keep them in good humour; for if once they are di&s;|carded, no other man will take them: &s;o that the more wives a man has, the better he is provided for; and this principally contributes to keep up the brutal cu&s;tom. The nation of Loretto is, indeed, more moderate, the chief men among them never having more than two wives, whil&s;t the generality are contented with one. Adultery is accounted a crime that calls for revenge, except on two occa&s;ions. One, at their fe&s;tivals and routs, and the other at their wre&s;tling matches, among the rancherias; as on the&s;e occa&s;ions it is the &s;candalous privilege of the victor.

<P>The manner of negociating their marriages in the nation of Loretto, which inhabits the middle part of California, is to pre&s;ent the bride, by way of earne&s;t, with a batea, or jug, in their language called <HI>Olo.</HI> Her acceptance of it denotes her con&s;ent; and, on her part, &s;he pre&s;ents him, in return, with a net for his head. This reciprocal exchange of pre&s;ents confirms the mar|riage. In the other nations, the agreement is concluded at the end of a ball, to which the lover invites the whole

rancheria; but, after all this &s;olemnity of contract, the &s;lighte&s;t motive annuls it.</P>
<P>The Californians had adopted that ab&s;urdity, which is &s;o much laughed at in the accounts of Brazil, namely, that of the women going, immediately after delivery, to &s;ome water to wa&s;h them&s;elves and the child; and in other particulars, u&s;ing no manner of caution, but going to the fore&s;t for wood and food, and performing every other &s;ervice the hu&s;band wanted; whil&s;t he lay in his cave, or &s;tretched at full length under a tree, affecting to be extremely ill and weak. Mothers were even known to de&s;troy their children, in any &s;carcity of food, till Father <HI>Salva Tierra</HI> put a &s;top to this unnatural practice, by ordering that a double allowance &s;hould be given to women newly delivered. It was al&s;o an e&s;ta|bli&s;hed cu&s;tom among them, like that in the Jewi&s;h law, for a widow to marry the brother, or neare&s;t relation of the decea&s;ed.</P>
<P>The time of gathering the pitahayas is their vintage, and they celebrate it with particular mirth and rejoicings. "The three pitahaya months," &s;ays <HI>Salva Tierra,</HI> "re|&s;emble the carnival in &s;ome parts of Europe, when the men are, in a great mea&s;ure, &s;tupified or mad. At this time the nation throw a&s;ide what little rea&s;on they have, giving them&s;elves up to fea&s;tings, dancings, entertain|ments of the neighbouring rancherias, and buffooneries; and in the&s;e whole nights are &s;pent, to the high diver&s;ion
<PB N="286" REF="298">
of the audience. The actors are cho&s;en for their talent of imitation, and they execute their parts admirably well.</P>
<P>As practice naturally produces perfection, their ex|cellence in the&s;e dances is not to be wondered at, it being their whole occupation in time of peace. They dance at their weddings; on any good &s;ucce&s;s in fi&s;hing or hunting; at the birth of their children; at a plentiful harve&s;t; at a victory over their enemies; and on any other occa&s;ion, without weighing the importance of it. To the&s;e fe&s;tivities the rancherias u&s;ually invite one another; and likewi&s;e often &s;end challenges for wre&s;tling, leaping, running, &s;hooting with their bow, and trials of &s;trength; and in the&s;e and the like &s;ports, days and nights, weeks and months, are often &s;pent in times of peace. But the&s;e tranquil &s;ea&s;ons are &s;ubject to frequent interruptions of wars, factions, and feuds of &s;ome nations and rancherias again&s;t others. The end of the&s;e com|motions is not the acqui&s;ition of &s;ame, or the enlarge|ment of territory, but u&s;ually revenge for affronts, or injuries among private per&s;ons; or &s;ometimes they ari&s;e from more &s;ub&s;tantial cau&s;es; when a rancheria, or nation has a right to fi&s;h, hunt, or gather fruits, where another has a kind of right by pre&s;cription, the man|ner of revenge is to commit &s;ome ho&s;tility, or do &s;ome damage to the per&s;on chiefly offending; or if he is be|yond their power, to do it to his kindred, or rancheria. After this, all make the cau&s;e their own; and if they do
<PB N="287" REF="299">
not think them&s;elves able to give battle to their enemies, they apply to other rancherias for &s;uccour, with whom they are in amity. The manner of declaring war, is with a frightful noi&s;e, ordering every one to provide great quantities of reeds and flints, taking care that this declaration &s;hall not reach their adver&s;aries, that, by terrifying them, they may obtain the ea&s;ier victory. When they come to action, they &s;et up a &s;hout, and en|gage without any regularity, except in relieving the bodies in front, when they give way, either as quite &s;pent, or for want of arrows, which are made of reeds, with &s;harp flints for their points, but not poi&s;oned. When the en|gagement becomes clo&s;e, they make u&s;e of a kind of wooden &s;pears, with the points &s;harpened and hardened in the fire, which do equal execution with tho&s;e pointed with &s;teel. The victory is gained, not &s;o much by addre&s;s, conduct, &s;trength, and courage, as by keeping up their &s;pirits again&s;t their innate fear, or in&s;piring the enemy with it.</P>
<P>The characteri&s;tics of the Californians, as well as of all other Indians, are &s;tupidity, and in&s;en&s;ibility; want of knowledge and reflection; incon&s;tancy, impetuo&s;ity, and blindne&s;s of appetite; an exce&s;&s;ive &s;loth, and abhorrence of all labour and fatigue; an ince&s;&s;ant love of plea&s;ure and amu&s;ement of every kind, however trifling or brutal; pu&s;il|lanimity and relaxne&s;s; in &s;hort, a mo&s;t wretched want of every thing which con&s;titutes the real man, and renders him rational, inventive, tractable, and u&s;eful to him&s;elf and

&s;ociety. It is not ea&s;y for Europeans, who never were out of their own country, to conceive an adequate idea of the&s;e people; for, even in the lea&s;t frequented corners of the globe, there is not a nation &s;o &s;tupid, of &s;uch contracted ideas, and &s;o weak both in body and mind, as the unhappy Cali|fornians. Their under&s;tanding comprehends little more than what they &s;ee, ab&s;tract ideas, and much le&s;s a chain of rea&s;oning, being fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> beyond their power; &s;o that they &s;carce can improve their fir&s;t ideas, and the&s;e are in general fal&s;e and inadequate. It is in vain to repre&s;ent to them any future advantages, which will re&s;ult to them by doing, or ab&s;taining, from this or that particular, the relation of means and ends being beyond the &s;tretch of their faculties: nor have they the lea&s;t notion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;uch intentions as will procure them|&s;elves &s;ome future good, or guard them again&s;t evils. Their in&s;en&s;ibility to corporeal objects, &s;hew what little re|gard they have to future rewards and puni&s;hments. They have only a few faint glimmerings of moral virtues and vices; &s;o that &s;ome things appear good, and others evil, without any reflection; and though they enjoy the light of natural rea&s;on, and that divine grace, which is given to all without di&s;tinction, yet, the one is &s;o weak, and the other &s;o little attended to, that, without any regard to decency, plea&s;ure and profit are the &s;pring and end of all their actions.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="301">Their will is proportionate to their faculties; and all their pa&s;&s;ions move in a very narrow &s;phere. Ambition, they have none; and are more anxious to be accounted &s;trong, than valiant. The mo&s;t that is ob&s;erved in them is, &s;ome little emulation. To &s;ee their companions prai&s;ed or rewarded, rou&s;es them, and is, indeed, the only thing which &s;timulates, and prevails on them to &s;hake off their innate &s;loth. They are equally free from avarice, that de&s;tructive pa&s;&s;ion, which makes &s;uch havock in polite nations. The utmo&s;t extent of their de&s;ires, is to get the pre&s;ent day's food, without much fatigue, taking little care for that of the en&s;uing day.</P>
<P>This di&s;po&s;ition of mind, as it gives them up to an amazing languor, and la&s;&s;itude, their lives fleeting away in a perpetual inactivity and dete&s;tation of labour; &s;o it likewi&s;e leads them to be attracted by the fir&s;t object, which their own fancy, or the per&s;ua&s;ion of another, places before them; and at the &s;ame time renders them as prone to alter their re&s;olutions with the &s;ame facility. They look with indifference on any kindne&s;s done them; nor is the bare remembrance of it to be expected from them. Their hatred and revenge are excited by the &s;lighte&s;t cau&s;es; but they are as ea&s;ily appea&s;ed, and even without any &s;atisfaction, e&s;pecially if they meet with oppo&s;ition. For, though courage &s;eems the only thing they value, it may be &s;aid, with truth, that they have not the lea&s;t notion of true bravery. Their rancour and fury la&s;t no longer than whil&s;t they meet with re&s;i&s;tance.
<PB N="290" REF="302">
The lea&s;t thing daunts them; and when once they begin to yield, their fear will induce them to &s;toop to the ba&s;e&s;t indignities. As, on the contrary, by obtaining any advantage, or if the enemy becomes di&s;heartened, they &s;well with the mo&s;t extravagant pride. In a word, the&s;e unhappy mortals may be compared to children, in whom the developement of rea&s;on is not compleated. They may, indeed, be called a nation who never arrive at manhood. Their predominant pa&s;&s;ion is &s;uitable to &s;uch an unhappy condition, in which they make &s;o little u&s;e of rea&s;on; I mean, a violent fondne&s;s for all kind of diver&s;ion, plea&s;ure, fe&s;tivals, games, dancing, and revels, in which they bruti&s;hly wa&s;te their mi&s;erable days. However, in the Californians are &s;een few of tho&s;e bad di&s;po&s;itions, for which the other Americans are infamous. No &s;trong liquors are u&s;ed among them; and it is only on their fe&s;tivals that they intoxicate them&s;elves, and then with the &s;moke of wild tobacco. What little every one has, is &s;afe from theft; quarrels are rarely known among them; and the &s;everal members of a rancheria live in great harmony among them&s;elves, and peaceably with others. All their malice and rage they re&s;erve for their enemies: and &s;o far are they from ob&s;tinacy, har&s;hne&s;s, or cruelty, that nothing can exceed their docility and gentlene&s;s; con&s;equently are ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to good or evil.</P>
<P>The government of the Californians cannot be &s;up|po&s;ed to exceed the &s;hort limits of their capacity, there
<PB N="291" REF="303">
being among them neither divi&s;ion of lands or po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions, and con&s;equently no &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to immoveables; nor, on the other hand, any complaints of illegal intru|&s;ions. Every nation, or language, con&s;i&s;ts of &s;everal rancherias, more or le&s;s in number, according to the fertility of the &s;oil; and each rancheria, of one or more families, united by con&s;anguinity. But when the mi&s;|&s;ionaries came among them, neither the rancherias, nor the nations, had a chief or &s;uperior, to whom they paid obedience, or who&s;e authority they acknowledged by any kind of tribute, or external ceremony. Every family governed it&s;elf, according to their own fancy; and the natural obedience from &s;ons to fathers was very little, after the former were able to provide for them&s;elves. The &s;orcerers and jugglers, of whom we &s;hall &s;peak, were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome kind of &s;uperiority; but this la&s;ted no longer than the time of their fe&s;tivals, or during the time of &s;ickne&s;s, or other incidents, which excited their fear or &s;uper&s;tition. However, in the rancherias, and even in the nations, the mi&s;&s;ionaries found one, two, or more, who gave orders for gathering the produces of the earth; directed the fi&s;heries, and the military expeditions, in ca&s;e of a quarrel with any other rancheria, or nation. This dignity was not obtained by blood, and de&s;cent; nor by age, &s;uffrages, or a formal election; the nece&s;&s;ity of applying for in&s;truction to one or more, on &s;ome com|mon exigency, rendered it natural, that, with a tacit con&s;ent, he who was brave, expert, artful, or eloquent, &s;hould be promoted to the command; but his authority
<PB N="292" REF="304">
was limited to terms, impo&s;ed by the fancy of tho&s;e who, without well knowing how, quietly &s;ubmitted to him.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Of the ancient Religion of the Californians.</HEAD>
<P>THE mo&s;t intere&s;ting &s;ubject for curio&s;ity, and which requires the greate&s;t accuracy and attention in treating it, is the ancient religion of the Californians. And the u&s;e to be made of &s;uch re&s;earches, in favour of our holy religion, is, in enumerating the different &s;ects, ancient and modern, of all nations in the world, to increa&s;e from their darkne&s;s, the lu&s;tre of the Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation. On the other hand, a faithful repre&s;enta|tion of the &s;hadow of death, in which the&s;e Indians lay immer&s;ed, will heighten the greatne&s;s of the Divine Good|ne&s;s,
<PB N="293" REF="305">
in bringing them into the bo&s;om of the church; many a father mi&s;&s;ionary has lo&s;t his life in the &s;acred cau&s;e; but Chri&s;tianity has now gained a pretty firm footing among them.</P>
<P>All relations agree, that hitherto no idolatry has been found among the Californians. They neither wor|&s;hipped any creatures, nor had any repre&s;entations or images of fal&s;e deities, to whom they paid any kind of adoration. In &s;hort, &s;carce any trace of religion was to be found among them; nor did their external perfor|mances &s;hew the lea&s;t knowledge of God; yet there was among them a &s;eries. of &s;peculative tenets, which mu&s;t &s;urprize the reader: for they not only have an idea of the unity and nature of God, as a pure &s;pirit, and likewi&s;e of the other &s;piritual beings; but al&s;o &s;ome faint glimmer|ings of the Trinity; the eternity of the Saviour, and other articles of the Chri&s;tian religion, though mixed with a thou&s;and ab&s;urdities. And this light was &s;o clear in them, that &s;ome mi&s;&s;ionaries have been induced to think, that they were de&s;cended from a people who had formerly been Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>There is, &s;ay they, in heaven, a Lord of great power, called <HI>Niparaya,</HI> who made the earth and the &s;ea, gives food to all creatures, created the trees and every thing we &s;ee, and can do whatever he plea&s;es. We do not &s;ee him, becau&s;e he has not a body like us. This Niparaya has a wife called <HI>Anayicoyondi;</HI> and though he
<PB N="294" REF="306">
makes no u&s;e of her, not having a body, he has had three &s;ons; of the&s;e, one is <HI>Quaayayp, i. e.</HI> man; and Anayicoyondi was delivered of him in the mountains of Acaragui. Quaayayp has been with the &s;outhern In|dians, and taught them. He was very powerful, and had a great number of men; for he went into the earth, and brought people from thence. At length the Indians through hatred killed him; and, at the &s;ame time, put a wreath of thorns upon his head. He is dead, but to this day remains very beautiful, and without any cor|ruption. Blood is continually running from him; he does not &s;peak, as being dead, but he has a tecolote, or owl, that &s;peaks for him. They further &s;ay, that in heaven there are many more inhabitants than on earth, and that formerly there were great wars in that place: a per&s;on of eminent power, whom &s;ome learned men call <HI>Wac,</HI> and others <HI>Tuparan,</HI> ro&s;e up again&s;t the &s;upreme Lord Niparaya, and, being joined by numerous adhe|rents, dared to &s;tand a battle with him; but was totally defeated by Niparaya, who immediately deprived Wac Tuparan of all his power, his fine pitahayas, and his other provi&s;ions; turned him out of heaven, confined him and his followers in a va&s;t cave under the earth; and created the whales in the &s;ea, to be as guards, that they &s;hould not leave their place of confinement: they add, that the &s;upreme Lord Niparaya does not like that people &s;hould fight, and that tho&s;e who die by an arrow or &s;pear do not go to heaven. But, on the contrary, Wac Tuparan wi&s;hes that all people were continually
<PB N="295" REF="307">
fighting, becau&s;e all who are killed in battle go to his cave. There are two parties among the&s;e Indians; one &s;iding with Niparaya, and are a &s;erious di&s;creet people, open to conviction, and readily li&s;ten to the Chri&s;tian truths, which are inforced upon them from their own tenets. The other party is that devoted to Wac Tupa|ran, and are of very perver&s;e di&s;po&s;itions, &s;orcerers, and unfortunately very numerous. The&s;e parti&s;ans of Wac Tuparan have &s;everal opinions peculiar to them&s;elves, and mon&s;trou&s;ly ab&s;urd; as, that the &s;tars are &s;hining pieces of metal; that the moon was created by Cucu|numic, the &s;tars by Purutabui, and the like.</P>
<P>The tenets of the Loretto nation are as follows: They have no word in their language &s;ignifying heaven, but expre&s;s it by the general word <HI>notu,</HI> which &s;ignifies above, or high. They &s;ay, that in the north part of heaven lives the &s;pirit of &s;pirits, which they call <HI>Gumongo;</HI> that he &s;ends pe&s;tilences and &s;ickne&s;&s;es; and, in former ages, &s;ent down another &s;pirit to vi&s;it the earth, to whom they give the name of <HI>Guyiaguai:</HI> that he was no &s;ooner come than he began to &s;ow the land with pitahayas, and like|wi&s;e made the creeks along the coa&s;t of the gulph, till he came to a va&s;t &s;tone in a very &s;pacious creek near Loretto, called by the Spaniards <HI>Puerto E&s;condido,</HI> where he re&s;ided for &s;ome time. Here, &s;ay they, the other infe|rior &s;pirits, his attendants, u&s;ed to bring him pitahayas to eat, and fi&s;h which they caught in the creek. Guyia|guai's occupation was to make ve&s;tments for his prie&s;ts,
<PB N="296" REF="308">
who, in their language, are called <HI>dicuinochos,</HI> of the hides which were offered to him. After &s;ome time, Guyia|guai continued his vi&s;itation, &s;owing pitahayas, and making creeks along all the coa&s;t of the Loretto nation; and, as a memorial, left a painted table, which the dicuinochos, or prie&s;ts, make u&s;e of at their entertain|ments. They add, that the &s;un, moon, and the morn|ing and evening &s;tars, are men and women; that every night they fail into the we&s;tern &s;ea, whence they are under a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;wimming out by the way of the ea&s;t; that the other &s;tars are lights made in heaven by that vi&s;iting &s;pirit and his attendants; and that, though they become quenched by the &s;ea-water, he goes toward the &s;un to light them again. It would be very tedious to enter into the many ab&s;urdities of the &s;ame kind, which were impo&s;ed on this unhappy people by their &s;tupid or de&s;igning prie&s;ts.</P>
<P>The nation of the Cochinies, is not only the mo&s;t nu|merous and extended, but they have likewi&s;e the be&s;t genius, and le&s;s extravagant opinions and brutality in their cu&s;toms; their behaviour is remarkably courteous, and they never break their word. They believe that there is in heaven a Lord, who&s;e name, in their lan|guage, &s;ignifies, He who lives; that he had a &s;on, with|out a mother, to whom they give two names, one of which imports perfection, or end of clay; the other &s;ignifies &s;wift. Be&s;ides him, they &s;ay, there is another, who&s;e name is, He who makes lords; though they give
<PB N="297" REF="309">
the name of lord to all the three; yet, when a&s;ked, How many lords there are? They an&s;wer One, who made the heavens, the earth, the animals, the trees, and fruits; al&s;o man and woman. They, likewi&s;e, have &s;ome notion of devils, &s;aying, that the great Lord called, "He who lives," created certain beings who are not &s;een, who revolted again&s;t him, and are enemies both to him and mankind: to the&s;e they give the name of lyars, en&s;na|rers, or &s;educers. They add, that when men die, the&s;e deceivers come and bury them that they may not &s;ee the Lord who lives. The converted Indians could have no de&s;ign of impo&s;ing on the mi&s;&s;ionaries, in telling them, that, before their conver&s;ion, they held opinions, in &s;ome re&s;pects, like their own; it is rea&s;onable, therefore, to conclude that &s;ome &s;torm, or other accident, carried to the coa&s;ts of California, &s;ome Europeans, or inhabi|bitants of the Philippines, of whom no memory now exi&s;ts among the Indians; and the&s;e, finding them&s;elves among barbarians, endeavoured to in&s;til into them the my&s;teries of chri&s;tianity; and that tho&s;e in&s;tructions, in proce&s;s of time, became more and more disfigured, till the arrival of the mi&s;&s;ionaries, when the place was con|quered by Spain.</P>
<P>It is now above two centuries &s;ince the coa&s;t of Cali|fornia has been vi&s;ited by Europeans. The inhabitants of Mexico, from the we&s;tern coa&s;t of New Spain, have frequented the Gulph of California to fi&s;h for pearls; and others have arrived at the we&s;tern coa&s;t, by the way
<PB N="298" REF="310">
of the South Sea. And, therefore, among a variety of accidents, either as puni&s;hment or from misfortune, one or more may have been obliged to remain among the&s;e Indians. There are a few negroes among them, the race of tho&s;e who had been left by a &s;hip from the Phi|lippine I&s;lands. Sir Francis Drake left a pilot on &s;hore, who, after &s;ome years, fortunately got away again; and &s;o lately as 1741, the Ru&s;&s;ians were obliged to leave on the &s;ame coa&s;t of America, and at a higher latitude, part of a &s;hip's company, who had &s;ailed on a di&s;covery; all which gives room to believe, that &s;ome Europeans, under a &s;imilar di&s;a&s;ter, had not the &s;ame good fortune to arrive at a country peopled with Europeans, after wandering over va&s;t tracts inhabited by Barbarians, but, on the contrary, were obliged to pa&s;s the remainder of their days among them.</P>
<P>Their <HI>Edues,</HI> or prie&s;ts, were what might be expected from this &s;hadow, or imitation of religion; they are fre|quently called <HI>Hechiceros,</HI> or &s;orcerers; but it is not to be thought, that the&s;e poor creatures had any commerce with apo&s;tate &s;pirits. It is known, that the &s;ame extravagant credulity obtained here, which not long &s;ince deluged the old world, with regard to the ancient, pagan oracles. But the mo&s;t &s;agacious mi&s;&s;ionaries found them out to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rrant impo&s;tors, pretending to hold intelligence with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">rits, the exi&s;tence of which was believed by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters">rnians. This &s;uppo&s;ed commerce with the devil, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> them great authority among that &s;imple people,
<PB N="299" REF="311">
and this reverence they &s;trengthened by certain ceremo|nies and ge&s;tures, and the introduction of many my&s;tic rites. What al&s;o &s;trengthened this authority, was their being the only phy&s;icians, from whom they could hope for relief, when &s;ick; and whatever was the medicine, it was always admini&s;tered with great o&s;tentation and &s;o|lemnity.</P>
<P>The Loretto Indians had &s;chools, in which the&s;e pro|fe&s;&s;ors in&s;tructed their youth in the above opinions, and recommended them as truths of great importance. But the authority of the Californian prie&s;ts, on no occa&s;ion, appears with &s;uch &s;plendor as in the public fea&s;ts. There are no &s;acrifices, or any other religious ceremonies at the&s;e times; but the whole con&s;i&s;ts of eating, drinking, dancing, talking, and laughing: yet the pre&s;ence of their prie&s;ts makes them con&s;idered as religious &s;olemnities; for they act the chief part, and dre&s;s them&s;elves in a habit of ceremony, which is only u&s;ed on extraordinary occa&s;ions. This con&s;i&s;ts of a large cloak, covering them from head to foot, and entirely compo&s;ed of human hair. The head is adorned with a very high plumage of hawk's feathers, and in their hands they carry a very large fan, formed of the large&s;t feathers of the &s;ame bird. The Southern Edues, when they cannot get feathers, adorn, or rather disfigure, their heads with the tails of deer, and the Cochinies of the north, add two &s;trings of the hoofs of the &s;ame bea&s;t; one as a chain round the neck, and the other as a girdle. The ridiculou&s;sne&s;s of this garb,
<PB N="300" REF="312">
is &s;till heightened by daubing their bodies over with red, black, and different colours; &s;o that the reader's fancy will ea&s;ily repre&s;ent what figures they make.</P>
<P>The&s;e prie&s;ts open the entertainment, with &s;ucking the Chacuaco, till they become frantic, and almo&s;t drunk with the &s;moke; thus intoxicated, they begin an oration on their tenets, which they deliver with wild ge&s;tures, and frightful vociferations; pretending to be in&s;pired by tho&s;e &s;pirits which the nation acknowledges; and in their name, denouncing whatever their frenzy or intere&s;t &s;ug|ge&s;ts; at other times, pretending to be the &s;pirits them|&s;elves. Whil&s;t the&s;e frantic preachers are haranguing, the others are fea&s;ting and dancing; and, being inflamed by gluttony, intemperance, and dancing, the whole concludes in the mo&s;t abominable gratification of their appetites, all mingling indi&s;criminately, as if determined to violate every principle of &s;hame, rea&s;on, and mo|de&s;ty.</P>
<P>Though the&s;e fea&s;ts are often made without any ne|ce&s;&s;ary cau&s;es, yet tho&s;e made at the gathering of the pitahayas, for a victory, for the di&s;tribution of the fi&s;h caught, and the deer-&s;kins, greatly &s;urpa&s;s the others in &s;olemnity; but that on boring the ears and no&s;trils of children exceeds all: to the&s;e all the women and men re&s;ort; the ornament of wearing pearls from their no&s;trils to their ears being common to both &s;exes. The &s;hrieks of the children on the&s;e occa&s;ions, incite the fathers to
<PB N="301" REF="313">
greater and louder &s;houts, in order to &s;uppre&s;s any &s;ym|pathy with the cries and tears of their children. At the&s;e fea&s;ts, the prie&s;ts do not omit exerci&s;ing that authority which they owe to the fears of the people, celebrating, according to their private pa&s;&s;ions, &s;ome, as brave and generous; upbraiding others, as cowards, factious and wicked; and even enjoining them certain penances, the mo&s;t cu&s;tom|ary of which is fa&s;ting, or ab&s;tinence. This is not the only method of cha&s;ti&s;ing them; they &s;ometimes order them to clear the ways along the highe&s;t mountains, for the more ea&s;y de&s;cent of the vi&s;iting &s;pirit, when it comes to &s;ee them, and at certain di&s;tances to lay a heap of &s;tones, where it may &s;top and re&s;t it&s;elf. But what cannot be read without horror, is, that the&s;e inhuman im|po&s;tors &s;ometimes even order them to throw them&s;elves down from a precipice; and though, in &s;o doing, they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be da&s;hed to pieces, yet &s;uch is the blindne&s;s and dread of the&s;e poor creatures, that it is very &s;eldom their orders fail of being executed, either willingly or by force. Be&s;ides this, the&s;e prie&s;ts rai&s;e contributions on all &s;uch as demand any provi&s;ions, and certain portions of human hair to make their cloaks, all which is paid as a tribute, with a punctual willingne&s;s. This tribute children pay in return for their in&s;truction, and the &s;ick adults, on recovery, in gratitude for their cure; and if not, for their care after death; for the Californians are not for&s;aken by their prie&s;ts when dead: on the contrary, they redouble their cares, and extend them to the whole rancheria. But when the di&s;temper arrives at &s;uch a
<PB N="302" REF="314">
height, as to be pa&s;t cure, they a&s;&s;emble all the patient's relations, that he may die with the greater unea&s;ine&s;s. If the patient has a daughter or &s;i&s;ter, they in the fir&s;t place cut off the little finger of her right hand, pretend|ing thereby, that the blood either cures the patient, or at lea&s;t, removes from the family all &s;orrow for his death; but is in reality an additional cau&s;e of pain and grief. Then follow the vi&s;its from the whole rancheria; who after talking to him, and being made acquainted with his de&s;|perate condition, &s;et up a confu&s;ed howling, &s;ometimes covering their faces, with their hands, and their hair, and repeating this ceremony from time to time, divided into &s;eparate companies, and all in the pre&s;ence of the dying per&s;on. The women increa&s;e the horror of the&s;e howlings with pa&s;&s;ionate cries and exclamations, &s;etting forth the merits of the patient, in order to move greater compa&s;&s;ion. The howling being over, the patient re|que&s;ts the company to &s;uck and blow him, in the &s;ame manner as the phy&s;ician had done. This is by filling a tube made out of a hard, black &s;tone, with tobacco, applying the end of it to the part affected, and then with their mouth at the other end, &s;ometimes &s;ucking up the &s;moke, at others blowing it through the tube, on the di&s;ea&s;ed part with all their force. This friendly office is performed by every one, as this and the &s;trength of their cries, is the be&s;t proof of their degree of affection for the &s;ick per&s;on: in the mean time, the doctors thru&s;t their hands into the patient's mouth, pretending to pluck death forcibly out of his body. The women &s;till con|tinuing
<PB N="203" REF="315">
their outcries, give the patient many &s;evere &s;trokes, in order to awake him, till between one un|ea&s;ine&s;s and another, they deprive the poor wretch of life, and as &s;oon as dead, they proceed to bury or burn him, as is mo&s;t convenient. The funerals are immedi|ately performed, without any preparation, amid&s;t a continuance of the &s;ame howlings, and without any &s;ingu|larity, only burying or burning, with the decea&s;ed, all his uten&s;ils; and &s;o little do they enquire into the reality of his death, previous to the burning or interment, that one day <HI>Salva Tierra</HI> tells us, ha&s;tening to the &s;pot, where they were going to burn a man, they &s;uppo&s;ed dead, and per|ceiving &s;ome remains of life in him, he &s;natched him from the fire, and in time recovered him, reproving their ra&s;hne&s;s and barbarity.</P>
<P>Father <HI>Torquemada,</HI> &s;peaking of the i&s;land of St. Catherine, in the neighbourhood of California, &s;ays, "In this i&s;land are rancherias, or communities, and in them a temple, with a large, level court, where they perform their &s;acrifices; and in one, was a large circular &s;pace, the place of the altar, with an enclo&s;ure of feathers of &s;everal birds of different colours; which I under&s;tood," &s;ays he, "were tho&s;e of the birds they &s;acrificed in great numbers: and within the circle, was an image, &s;trangely bedaubed with a variety of colours, repre&s;enting &s;ome devil, according to the manner of the Indians of New Spain, holding in its hand, a figure of the &s;un and moon. It happened, that when the &s;oldiers came to &s;ee this tem|ple,
<PB N="304" REF="316">
they found within the &s;aid circle, two crows, con|&s;iderably larger than ordinary; which at the approach of the Spaniards flew away, but allighted among the rocks in the neighbourhood. The &s;oldiers &s;eeing them of &s;uch uncommon &s;ize, fired their guns and killed them. At this, an Indian, who had attended the Spaniards as a guide, fell into an agony. I was informed that they be|lieved the devil &s;poke to them in the&s;e crows, and thence held them in great veneration. Sometime after, one of the religious going that way, &s;aw &s;ome Indian women wa&s;hing fi&s;h on the &s;hore, but &s;ome crows came up to them, and with their beaks, took the fi&s;h from their hands, whil&s;t they ob&s;erved a profound &s;ilence, not daring &s;o much as to look at them, much le&s;s frighten them away. Nothing therefore could &s;eem more horrible to the Cali|fornians, than that the Spaniards &s;hould &s;hoot at the&s;e re&s;pectable birds."</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of the Country, Climate, and Productions.</HEAD>
<P>THE Per&s;ian Empire, founded by <HI>Cyrus the Great,</HI> 578 years before the Chri&s;tian aera; was the &s;econd of the four ancient monarchies e&s;tabli&s;hed in the world, and at that period extended from the Gulph of Ormus, and the Red Sea, and from Ethiopia in the &s;outh, to the Euxine and Ca&s;pian &s;eas on the north; and from the river Indus, now called the Scind, in the ea&s;t, to the de&s;arts of Lybia, or that part of Africa bordering upon Egypt; the Mediterranean, and Archipelago Seas, on the we&s;t. But the boundaries of this kingdom are now &s;aid to be, India, or the Mogul's dominions on the
<PB N="306" REF="319">
ea&s;t; the ocean, and Per&s;ian Gulph, towards the &s;outh; the Turki&s;h empire on the we&s;t; and Circa&s;ia, the Ca&s;pian &s;ea, and the river Oxus, that divides it from U&s;bec-Tartary, towards the north. The mo&s;t &s;outhern part of Per&s;ia lies in 25 degrees north latitude, and the mo&s;t northern part in 45 degrees; of cour&s;e we may reckon it 1,200 miles long, from north to &s;outh; and, the mo&s;t we&s;tern part of it lying in 45 degrees of longitude from London; and the mo&s;t ea&s;tern in 67 degrees, its breadth and length are nearly equal; and was it not for the Ca&s;pian Sea, which divides the north-ea&s;t parts of Per&s;ia from the north-we&s;t, the form of the country would be almo&s;t &s;quare.</P>
<P>It con&s;i&s;ts of twelve provinces, of which Fars is the ancient Per&s;is, in which &s;tood the city Per&s;epolis, who&s;e magnificent ruins are the wonder of every traveller. Curde&s;tan, the ancient A&s;&s;yria, Erack, the ancient Parthia, now reckoned the principal province, and al|mo&s;t the centre of the empire; Gylan, the ancient Hyr|cania, and Aditbeitzan, the &s;outhern part of the an|cient Media. Of the province of Shirven, Armenia is a part.</P>
<P>Per&s;ia, extending from the 25th degree of latitude, and to the 45th, the longe&s;t day in the &s;outh is 13 hours and a half, and in the north above 15 hours. In &s;o great an extent of country, it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e that the air and &s;ea&s;ons are very different, as in fact they
<PB N="307" REF="320">
are. In the middle of the kingdom, their winter be|gins in November, and continues till March, with &s;evere fro&s;ts, and &s;now, which falls in great quantities, on their mountains, but not &s;o much in the level countries. From March to May, the wind is u&s;ually high, and from thence to September, they have a calm, &s;erene heaven, with not &s;o much as a cloud. And though it is pretty hot in the day-time, the refre&s;hing breezes, which blow con&s;tantly morning and evening, as well in the night, make the &s;ummer tolerable, e&s;pecially as the nights are near ten hours long. The climate of Shirauz in the province of Fars, where Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> &s;pent eight months, is, &s;ays that gentleman, one of the mo&s;t agreeable in the world; the extremes of heat and cold being &s;eldom felt. During the &s;pring of the year, the uncommonly beautiful flowers, of which they have a great variety of the brighte&s;t hues and fragancy, perfume the natural mildne&s;s of the air. The beauties of nature are here depicted in their fulle&s;t extent, the natural hi&s;torian and botani&s;t would here meet with ample &s;cope for their favourite inve&s;tigations; &s;o that the inhabitants of Shirauz confidently a&s;&s;ert the pre-emi|nence of their own city, to any other in the world; and the natural beauties of the place call forth the poetical exertions of a <HI>H&agrave;fez,</HI> a <HI>S&agrave;di,</HI> or a <HI>J&agrave;mi.</HI> In &s;ummer, the thermometer &s;eldom ri&s;es above 73 degrees in the day-time, and at night, generally &s;inks to 62 degrees. Their autumn is the wor&s;t &s;ea&s;on of the year; the rains then beginning to fall, and the air reckoned as unhealthy,
<PB N="308" REF="321">
producing colds, fluxes, and fevers. Though a great deal of heavy &s;now falls in winter, ice is rarely to be found, except on the mountain-tops, and in the more northern parts of Per&s;ia. The air is &s;o pure, at night, and the &s;tars &s;hine with that lu&s;tre, that one man may know another well, by their light; and people travel much more in the night than in the day. In this part of Per&s;ia, there are very &s;eldom any hurricanes or tem|pe&s;ts, and very little thunder and lightning; nor is it &s;ubject to earthquakes. In the fine weather, particu|larly &s;ummer, there is not the lea&s;t dew, or moi&s;ture; and even at other times, the dew is of that nature, that it will not ru&s;t the fine&s;t &s;teel, if left to dry on it. This dryne&s;s in the air cau&s;es their buildings to la&s;t a long time, and is undoubtedly one of the principal rea&s;ons, that the celebrated ruins of Per&s;epolis have endured for &s;o many ages, that place being &s;ituated in much &s;uch another valley as Shirauz, and but two days journey from it. It very &s;eldom rains, even in the winter, and no country, as appears from the hale complexion, of the natives, is more healthy than the heart of Per&s;ia.</P>
<P>In the month of March, &s;ays <HI>Hanway,</HI> the &s;un &s;hines &s;o &s;trongly on the &s;now, about Ca&s;bin, that the reflec|tion is injurious to the eyes, and half-blinds the people; and the &s;outhern parts, particularly about Gombron, we are told by other writers, is &s;o unhealthy about the &s;pring and fall, that the European factors never pa&s;s a year, without a dangerous illne&s;s carrying off &s;ome of
<PB N="309" REF="322">
them. It is a common thing for two to agree, that if one dies, the &s;urvivor &s;hall po&s;&s;e&s;s the other's fortune. The months of June, July, and Augu&s;t, are here &s;o very hot, that both natives and foreigners, get up into the mountains at that time. The hot winds which blow from the ea&s;tward, over a long tract of &s;andy de&s;arts, are ready to &s;uffocate them, and &s;ometimes there hap|pens a pe&s;tilential bla&s;t, that &s;trikes the traveller dead in an in&s;tant. It rains but very &s;eldom in the cour&s;e of the year; and the water they &s;ave, is very unwhole&s;ome.</P>
<P>The provinces of Georgia, Shirvan, and Aditbeitzan, which lie in the mo&s;t northern part of Per&s;ia, are very dry and warm in the &s;ummer, but &s;ubject to &s;torms and tempe&s;ts in the winter, and have as &s;evere fro&s;ts for &s;ix months, as any countries on the continent, in the &s;ame latitude; and as this part of Per&s;ia is very mountainous, there is frequently a great difference between the air on the north and &s;outh &s;ides of the mountains; and, in a few miles travelling, people think them&s;elves in a different climate; but cold as the mountains are in the north, they are extremely healthy. On the contrary, the &s;lat countries of Ghilan and Mezenderan, which lie upon the Ca&s;|pian Sea, and was the ancient Hyrcania, are very damp, full of &s;tinking mora&s;&s;es, and &s;o unhealthful, that the in|habitants retire into the mountains in the &s;ummer-time; all the water they have in the hot &s;ea&s;on being foul and corrupted.</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="323">As Sir <HI>John Chardin</HI> ob&s;erves, there is not a country in the world which has more mountains and fewer rivers than Per&s;ia; and &s;ome of the mountains are con&s;idered as the highe&s;t on the face of the earth. Mount Taurus branches it&s;elf out into different provinces, and runs quite through the country, from we&s;t to ea&s;t. The loftie&s;t mountains are tho&s;e called Ararat in Armenia, and tho&s;e which &s;eparate Media from Hyrcania, and Hyrcania from Erack. Tho&s;e that divide Fars from Carmenia are dry, barren rocks, and very lofty, but tho&s;e of Hyr|cania and Curde&s;tan covered with woods. Near Baku is a mountain that &s;parkles like diamonds, from the quantity of talc and chry&s;tal with which it abounds. There are through this kingdom va&s;t, &s;andy de&s;arts, &s;e|veral days journey over, where &s;carce a drop of water is to be met with; and the land in general on the frontiers lies uncultivated to di&s;courage their enemies from in|vading them. There are, however, &s;ome fruitful plains and vallies, where their principal cities &s;tand, which yield plenty of grain and herbage; and no country is more fruitful than the provinces which lie upon the Ca&s;pian Sea.</P>
<P>Not one-tenth part of the kingdom is cultivated. Many of the vallies are barren, which formerly were fruitful, when the waters were turned into them. In &s;ome provinces there are hundreds of fine aqueducts choaked up and buried in ruins.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="324">With re&s;pect to rivers, there is not one in the heart of the country, that will carry a boat of any burthen. The river Oxus that divides Per&s;ia from U&s;beck-Tartary is a large &s;tream; but as there are no branches of it that ri&s;e in the Per&s;ian dominions, it is of little u&s;e to them. But there are &s;everal &s;mall rivulets which fall from the mountains, and are conveyed by &s;ubterraneous channels, or otherwi&s;e, to their principal cities.</P>
<P>Water being &s;o &s;carce in Per&s;ia, there is no place where they hu&s;band it better, or have more ingenious contrivances, to convey it to their cities, and into their corn-fields and gardens. This is the care of govern|ment; and there is a great officer in every province who has the charge of the conveyance and di&s;tribution of the waters.</P>
<P>They turn all their little rivulets and &s;prings to &s;uch parts of the country where they are mo&s;t wanted. They dig wells al&s;o of a prodigious depth and breadth, out of which they draw water with oxen in great leather-buckets; which being emptied into ci&s;terns, is let out occa&s;ionally for &s;undry u&s;es. They have al&s;o va&s;t &s;ubterranean aque|ducts, through which water is conveyed twenty or thirty leagues. The&s;e are two fathoms high, and arched with brick; and at every 20 paces di&s;tance, are large holes, like wells, made for the convenience of carrying on the arch without working under-ground too far, and the more ea&s;y repairing of them. The di&s;tribution of river and
<PB N="312" REF="325">
&s;pring-water is made one day to one quarter of the town, and another day to another, when every one opens the canal or re&s;ervoir in his garden to receive it, and for which an annual &s;um is paid; and as it is ea&s;y for any to divert his neighbour's water into his own channel, &s;uch fraud is &s;everely puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the ocean, there are two &s;eas belonging to Per&s;ia, the Ca&s;pian Sea, and the Gulph of Per&s;ia. The former we have &s;poken of when treating of Tartary. The Per&s;ians have but few ve&s;&s;els on this &s;ea; but they are not &s;o negligent of the Gulph of Per&s;ia, or Bo&s;&s;ora, on account of the pearl-fi&s;hery, which is reckoned the be&s;t in the world. They are ma&s;ters of both &s;ides of this gulph, as well as the i&s;lands in it. The pearl-fi&s;hery lies near the i&s;land of Baharem. Of the re&s;t of the i&s;lands, Ormus, &s;ituated at the entrance of this &s;ea, is the mo&s;t famous, and is about thirty miles round. This was once in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Portugue&s;e, who then commanded the pearl-fi&s;hery, and all the trade of Per&s;ia, and who built on it one of the mo&s;t elegant cities in A&s;ia. But this city is gone, and there is nothing on the i&s;land, but an indifferent ca&s;tle, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Per&s;ians, the trade being removed to Gombron, about two leagues di&s;tant. The i&s;land it&s;elf never produced any thing but &s;alt, which grows in a &s;olid cru&s;t, two inches deep, on the &s;urface of the ground; and the hills appear, at a di&s;tance, with it, as if covered with &s;now. Nor is there
<PB N="313" REF="326">
a drop of fre&s;h water on the i&s;land. The Portugue&s;e fetched their water from the continent.</P>
<P>About 160 years ago, the King of Per&s;ia, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Engli&s;h Ea&s;t-India Company's &s;hips, expelled the Portugue&s;e; for which they were allowed half the cu&s;toms of Gombron, which amounted to about 40,000<HI>l.</HI> a year. But the Per&s;ians afterwards took the whole cu&s;toms them&s;elves, making the Engli&s;h Company &s;ome trifling acknowledgment.</P>
<P>Near 23 miles to the &s;outh-we&s;t of Ki&s;lar, on the fron|tiers of Tartary, on the fir&s;t Circa&s;&s;ian mountain, lying on the &s;outh of the river Tereck, there is a well about 40 fa|thoms deep, from which i&s;&s;ues boiling water into a &s;tone ba&s;on. Hence it falls down a precipice near 30 fathoms into the Tereck, in &s;ufficient quantities to turn the wheel of a mill. The Tartars convey it into pits, and find great relief in many complaints from bathing in it. Among &s;everal experiments which a &s;urgeon made on this water, he found, that after it was bottled up clo&s;e, for a &s;hort time, the naptha-&s;mell it had, went off. Near this hill are &s;even &s;prings of the &s;ame kind of water, and one, which appears impregnated with alium, being &s;o acid and a&s;tringent, as not to be borne long in the mouth. The heat of the water is &s;o great, that a fowl has been boiled in it in nine minutes. This quick coction may be ow|ing to the quantity of naptha in the water. Not far di&s;tant, are &s;everal &s;mall pits dug in the earth, in which
<PB N="314" REF="327">
there is &s;alt of the utmo&s;t purity of colour and bright|ne&s;s, which di&s;&s;olves in the mouth in&s;tantaneou&s;ly, giving a very pungent &s;en&s;ation. Even in cold weather, the warmth of the&s;e wells produces near them the verdure and flowers of &s;pring. About half a mile we&s;tward of this hill, are &s;even wells of naptha, in which the wild &s;wine delight to lie. The Tartars u&s;e it for their lamps, and to grea&s;e the axletrees of their carts.</P>
<P>The chief place for the black, or dark-grey naptha is a &s;mall i&s;land in the Ca&s;pian Sea, now uninhabited, except at times, when they fetch the naptha. The Per|&s;ians load it in bulk, in their wretched ve&s;&s;els, &s;o that &s;ometimes the &s;ea is covered with it for leagues together. When the weather is thick and hazy, the &s;prings boil up the higher; and the naptha often takes fire on the &s;urface of the earth, and runs in a flame into the &s;ea, in great quantities, to an almo&s;t incredible di&s;tance. It is a kind of oil that will encru&s;t, grow hard, and look like pitch. The people u&s;e it, mixt with a &s;mall quantity of a&s;hes, to burn in lamps, and boil their food, but it leaves a di&s;agreeable &s;mell. They keep it at a &s;mall di&s;tance from their hou&s;es, in earthen ve&s;&s;els, under ground, to pre|vent accidents from its firing, which it is very liable to do. Every family in its neighbourhood is well &s;upplied with it.</P>
<P>They have al&s;o, on the penin&s;ula of Apcheron, a white naptha of a much thinner con&s;i&s;tency; but this is found
<PB N="315" REF="328">
only in &s;mall quantities. The Ru&s;&s;ians drink it, both as a cordial, and a medicine; but it does not intoxicate. It is taken internally for the &s;tone, for di&s;orders in the brea&s;t, and in venereal ca&s;es, and &s;ore heads, to both the la&s;t of which the Per&s;ians are very &s;ubject. Exter|nally applied, it is of great u&s;e in &s;corbutic pains, cramps, gout, &amp;c. It penetrates into the blood in|&s;tantaneou&s;ly, and, for a &s;hort time, creates great pain. Like &s;pirits of wine, it takes out grea&s;y &s;pots from &s;ilk and woollen, but leaves a bad &s;mell. It has been car|ried as a great rarity into India, and being prepared as a Japan, is the mo&s;t beautiful and la&s;ting of any that has yet been tried.</P>
<P>In the neighbourhood of Baku, on the Ca&s;pian Sea, is a phenomenon of a very extraordinary nature; in &s;ome manner peculiar to this country, and therefore de&s;erves a particular de&s;cription. It is called the <HI>Everla&s;ting Fire;</HI> and to it a &s;ect of Indians and Per&s;ians, called <HI>Gebers</HI> or <HI>Gaurs,</HI> pay religious wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>It lies about 10 Engli&s;h miles, north-ea&s;t by ea&s;t, from the city of Baku, in the province of Shirvan, on dry, rocky land. Here are &s;everal ancient temples, built with &s;tone, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been all dedicated to fire: mo&s;t of them are arched vaults, from 10 to 15 feet high. Among others there is a little temple, in which the Indians now wor&s;hip. Near the altar, about three feet high, is a large, hollow cane, from the end of which
<PB N="316" REF="329">
i&s;&s;ues a blue flame, in colour and gentlene&s;s nor unlike a lamp, burning with &s;pirits, but &s;eemingly more pure. The&s;e Indians affirm, that this flame has continued ever &s;ince the flood; and they believe it will la&s;t to the end of time; that if it was re&s;i&s;ted or &s;uppre&s;&s;ed in that place, it would break out and ri&s;e in &s;ome other. There are generally 40 or 50 of the&s;e poor devotees, who come on a pilgrimage from their own country, and &s;ub&s;i&s;t on wild &s;elery, and a kind of Jeru&s;alem artichokes, which are very good food, with other roots and herbs, found a little to the northward.</P>
<P>A little way from this temple is a low cliff of a rock, in which there is a horizontal gap, two feet from the ground, near &s;ix feet long, and about three feet broad, out of which i&s;&s;ues a con&s;tant flame of the colour and nature I have de&s;cribed. When the wind blows, it ri&s;es &s;ometimes eight feet high, but much lower in &s;till wea|ther. It is not ob&s;erved, that the flame makes any im|pre&s;&s;ion on the rock. This al&s;o the Indians wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>The earth round this place, for more than two miles, has this &s;urpri&s;ing property, that by taking up two or three inches of the &s;urface, and applying a live coal to it, the part which is &s;o uncovered immediately takes fire, almo&s;t before the coal touches the earth. The flame makes the &s;oil hot, but does not con&s;ume it, nor affect what is near it, with any degree of heat. Any quantity of this earth, carried to another place, does not
<PB N="317" REF="330">
produce this effect. Eight hor&s;es were once con&s;umed by this fire, being under a roof where the &s;urface of the ground was turned up, and by &s;ome accident took flame.</P>
<P>If a cane or tube, even of paper, be &s;et about two inches in the ground, confined, and clo&s;ed with earth below, and the top of it touched with a live coal and blown upon, a flame will immediately i&s;&s;ue, without burning either the cane or paper, provided the edges be covered with clay; and this method they u&s;e, for light in their hou&s;es, which have only the earth for their floor. Three or four of the&s;e lighted canes, will boil water in a pot, and thus they dre&s;s their victuals. The flame may be extingui&s;hed in the &s;ame manner as that of &s;pirits of wine. The ground is dry and &s;tony, and the more &s;tony any particular part is, the &s;tronger and clearer is the flame. It &s;mells &s;ulphureous, like naptha, but not very offen&s;ive.</P>
<P>Here are al&s;o &s;prings of hot water, which &s;trengthen the &s;tomach by bathing in them, and formerly cau&s;ed the place to be frequented by a number of Per&s;ians, and other people of the fir&s;t quality from the remote&s;t parts. For there are many &s;tately remains of buildings, an exten&s;ive burying-place, and a large mo&s;que, with a fine &s;tone cupola.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="331">Near great towns they improve their lands with &s;treet-dirt; but, at a greater di&s;tance, they lay their fields into little level &s;quares, banking them round, and then turning the water into them, and flow them. Where the ground is light, they plough it with two or three oxen or buffaloes; but in Ghilan, and other &s;tiff coun|tries, it is as much as eight or ten oxen can do, to draw their ploughs, which are very large.</P>
<P>Rice, wheat, and barley, are almo&s;t the only kinds of grain growing in Per&s;ia. Oats they have none, and little or no rye. Their &s;ea&s;ons are not the &s;ame in the north as in the &s;outh; for, when they are &s;owing in one part of the country, they are reaping in another, and in &s;ome places it is not more than three months between &s;eed-time and harve&s;t. Their land never lies fallow. It is &s;o meliorated and enriched by flowing, and the heat of the &s;un afterwards working on the mud, that it is never out of heart; and though we have not &s;o warm a &s;un, were we to flow &s;ome of our ground as they do, I am per&s;uaded it would be a va&s;t improvement, e&s;pecially where dung and other manure is wanting.</P>
<P>Their kitchen-gardens are well &s;tocked with mo&s;t of the roots and herbs we have in Europe. They have no le&s;s than 20 &s;everal &s;orts of melons, the common people make them their con&s;tant food in &s;ummer. Tho&s;e that ripen in the latter part of the &s;ea&s;on are the be&s;t and large&s;t; &s;ome of them weigh eight or ten
<PB N="319" REF="332">
pounds, and are as &s;weet as &s;ugar. At the tables of per&s;ons of quality they have them all the year round, having a method of pre&s;erving them under ground, and, it is &s;aid, &s;ome will eat eight or ten pounds of melon at a meal, and not be &s;ick. The be&s;t melons grow in Cho|ra&s;&s;an, near Tartary, and are carried as far as I&s;pahan for the King's u&s;e, and as pre&s;ents to friends. Cucumbers are another fruit much eaten by the common people. One &s;ort has &s;carce any &s;eeds in it, and is eaten with|out paring or dre&s;&s;ing, and not reckoned unwhole&s;ome.</P>
<P>Of grapes they have &s;everal kinds, and very &s;weet, and &s;ome &s;o large, that a &s;ingle grape is a mouthful. The celebrated wine of Shirauz is made of a &s;mall black grape without &s;tones. It is very delicious, and though, at fir&s;t ta&s;te, rather unplea&s;ant to a European, yet tho&s;e who have drank it for &s;ome time, prefer it to every other. They wrap up the bunches in linen bags, and let them hang on the trees all the winter, and gather them as wanted. The dryne&s;s of the air pre&s;erves all kinds of fruit a long time. Cherries here are but indif|ferent, but apples, pears, peaches, quinces, apricots, nectarines, and gage plumbs, are all very good, and in great plenty. The pomegranate is good to a proverb. The Per&s;ians call it the fruit of paradi&s;e.</P>
<P>Dates are reckoned one of the mo&s;t delicious fruits of this country. They are no where &s;o good as in Per&s;ia. The pulp, which enclo&s;es the &s;tone, is a clammy &s;ub|&s;tance,
<PB N="320" REF="333">
as &s;weet as honey. The tree which bears them is &s;lender, but tall, and like other palms, has no branches, but on the top, and the fruit grows in clu&s;ters of 30 or 40lb. weight. The tree does not bear till it is 15 years old, and, it is &s;aid, will continue bearing 100 years. When the fruit is ripe, it is laid in heaps, and, melting, will candy, and pre&s;erve it&s;elf without &s;ugar.</P>
<P>If they knew any thing of gardening, they would have mo&s;t of the European fruits in greater perfection, than in any part of Europe; but they under&s;tand neither grafting nor inoculating. All their trees run up very high and are loaded with wood. They have apricots of &s;everal kinds, that come into &s;ea&s;on one after another; and their nectarines and peaches weigh 16 or 18 ounces each. They have an apricot, red within, called by them the egg of the &s;un. The&s;e are dryed, and exported in va&s;t quantities. They are boiled in water, which is thickened by the juice of the fruit, and makes a perfect &s;yrup, without &s;ugar.</P>
<P>The pi&s;tachio-nuts are almo&s;t peculiar to Per&s;ia, and tran&s;ported all the world over. We have them com|monly in London. They have likewi&s;e nuts, filberds, almonds, and olives; but know not how to extract oil from, or pre&s;erve, the la&s;t. They have al&s;o plantations of &s;ugar and tobacco.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="334">Among the garden-trees, they have the cypre&s;s, the palm, and the mulberry. Of the la&s;t, there are large plantations for &s;ilk-worms, which they never &s;uffer to grow up to be great trees, becau&s;e the leaves are be&s;t, when the &s;hoots are young. But the tree in as great e&s;teem as any in Per&s;ia, is the &s;enna. The body of this tree is very large, and generally 40 or 50 feet high, &s;trait as the ma&s;t of a &s;hip, having no branches but on the head. The bark is of a bright grey; and the wood &s;erves them to make doors, rafters, and for other u&s;es in building. The tree which bears the gall-nut is common in many parts of Per&s;ia; and there are trees which yield gum-ma&s;tic, and frankincen&s;e; that which produces the latter is very much like a pear-tree. There are trees al&s;o, which pro|duce manna of &s;everal &s;orts. The leaves of the tameri&s;k manna-tree drop liquid manna in &s;ummer-time, which the natives take to be the &s;weat of the tree congealed upon the leaf. In the morning the ground under it is perfectly fat and grea&s;y with it. The cotton-tree is common all over Per&s;ia; and they have another little tree, which yields a kind of &s;ilken down, u&s;ed for quilt|ing and &s;tuffing of pillows. There is al&s;o a plant, called <HI>hannah,</HI> that bears an orange-coloured &s;eed, which they beat to powder, and colour their hands, feet, and faces with, from an opinion, that it keeps the &s;kin &s;mooth, and pre&s;erves the complexion.</P>
<P>The exce&s;&s;ive heat, in the &s;outhern parts of Per&s;ia, prevents any flowers growing; but nothing can be more
<PB N="322" REF="335">
beautiful than the fields of Hyrcania. Here are whole groves of orange-trees, je&s;&s;amines, and all the flowers we have in Europe. That part of the country which is called Mazenderan is one continued parterre, from Sep|tember to April. The whole country at this time is covered with flowers; and this, though it be their winter-&s;ea&s;on, is al&s;o the be&s;t time for fruits. In the other months the heat is &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, and the air &s;o unhealth|ful, that the natives, as I have ob&s;erved, retire to the mountains. In Media, the fields produce tulips, ane|monies, and ranunculas. About I&s;pahan and other towns, jonquils grow wild; but they have the greate&s;t quantity of lillies and ro&s;es. They export abundance of ro&s;e-water. In the &s;pring, they have a red flower that re&s;embles a clove, of a beautiful, &s;carlet colour. Every &s;prig, bears thirty of the&s;e flowers, which form a head as large as a tennis ball. Their ro&s;es are white, yellow, and red, and others, white on one &s;ide and yellow on the other; but notwith&s;tanding this variety, their gardens are not to be compared to ours. As flowers are &s;o common, they are little regarded; we &s;ee them intermixed with fruit-trees, without any order; no borders or knots of flowers. All that is met with in their fine&s;t gardens, is, walks planted with trees, fountains, canals, and plea|&s;ure-hou&s;es, at proper di&s;tances; nor do the Per&s;ians take any more plea&s;ure in walking in them, than we do in the fields, but &s;it down in &s;ome alcove, regardle&s;s of that ex|qui&s;ite variety that every foreigner is enamoured with. In|deed, were the&s;e things as common in Europe, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
<PB N="323" REF="336">
by every cottager, we probably &s;hould regard them as little as we do other things, which we enjoy in common with the lowe&s;t of mankind.</P>
<P>Per&s;ia al&s;o affords great plenty of drugs, as ca&s;&s;ia, &s;enna, antimony, nux vomica, gum armoniac, galbanum, &s;al armoniac, and a kind of rhubarb. The Per&s;ian pop|pies are in great e&s;teem from the quantity of juice they yield, and the &s;trength of it. They grow four feet high in &s;ome places, and have white leaves. The juice is extracted from them in June, when they are ripe. By making little inci&s;ions in the head of the poppy, a thick liquor oozes from them, which is gathered in the morn|ing before &s;un-ri&s;e. It is &s;aid to have &s;uch an effect on tho&s;e who collect it, that they look, as if they had been buried and taken up again, and their limbs tremble, as if they had the pal&s;y. The liquor thus drawn from them, in a little time, grows thick, and is made up into pills, which we call Opium. The Per&s;ian bakers &s;trew poppy-&s;eed upon their bread, which inclines tho&s;e who eat it to &s;leep, and eating it is not reckoned unwhole&s;ome after their meals. The common people eat the &s;eed almo&s;t at any time. Saffron grows plentifully in Per&s;ia, and a&s;&s;a-foetida, which to us is the mo&s;t offen&s;ive of all &s;mells, is to them a mo&s;t refre&s;hing perfume, and is to be found almo&s;t every where.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;a-foetida is a liquor which di&s;tils from the plant called <HI>Hiltot.</HI> It thickens after it is drawn, and grows
<PB N="324" REF="337">
as hard as gum. Mummy, which is human fle&s;h em|balmed, that has lain in dry earth &s;everal ages, and be|come hard as horn, is frequently found in the &s;ands of Chora&s;&s;an on the ancient Bactria; and &s;ome of the bodies are &s;o little altered, it is &s;aid, that the features may be plainly di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>The bezoar &s;tone of Per&s;ia is held to be much better than the Indian bezoar. This is a &s;tone, with &s;everal thin coats over it, found in the entrails of goats and other animals.</P>
<P>Per&s;ia is not without its minerals: it is conjectured that, among their va&s;t mountains, there may be &s;ome mines of gold and &s;ilver, but none are open, nor have they an account that any were ever wrought, except their lead-mines&punc; which yield a &s;mall quantity of &s;ilver, as all lead-mines do, but not enough to pay for extract|ing. They have, however, good mines of iron, &s;teel, copper, and lead. The iron and &s;teel-mines are in Hy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cania, Media, and the provinces of E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ack and Cho|ra&s;ian. Their &s;teel is &s;o full of &s;ulphur, that, if the fil|ings are thrown into the fire, they will give a report like gunpowder. It has a fine, delicate grain, but is as brittle as gla&s;s, and the Per&s;ian artificers, not under|&s;tanding how to temper it, cannot convert it to any nice work.</P>
<P>Sulphur and &s;alt-petre are dug in the mountain Da|maveid, which divides Hyrcania from Erack. Anti|mony
<PB N="325" REF="338">
is found in Carmenia, and emery is had near Niris. Vitriol, and mercury, they have none; and their tin is imported from abroad. They have two kinds of &s;alt, one, on the &s;urface of the ground, and the other, dug off the rocks. There are plains ten or twelve leagues over, quite covered with &s;alt, as others are with &s;ulphur and alium. The &s;alt is &s;o hard in &s;ome parts of Car|menia, that the poor people u&s;e it, in&s;tead of &s;tone, to build their cottages with.</P>
<P>Their marble is either black, white, or red, and &s;ome veined with white and red. It is dug near Hamadan and Lu&s;iana; &s;ome of it will divide into large flakes, like &s;late, but the be&s;t comes from Tauris, and is almo&s;t as tran&s;parent as cry&s;tal. This kind is white, mixed with green. In the country about Tauris, al&s;o, is found the mineral azure. In Fars and Shirvan is found abun|dance of bole armoniac, and a marl, which the country people u&s;e in&s;tead of &s;oap. There are &s;ome mines of tale, or i&s;ingla&s;s, in the &s;ame country.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t valuable mines in Per&s;ia, are tho&s;e where the Tuquois &s;tones are found. There is one at Ni&s;apour in Chora&s;&s;an, and another in a mountain between Erack and Hyrcania. All that are dug are pre&s;erved for the King, and when he has taken tho&s;e he likes be&s;t, he or|ders the re&s;t to be &s;old.</P>
<P>In the Gulph of Per&s;ia, there was formerly the fine&s;t pearl-fi&s;hery in the world. <HI>Chardin</HI> &s;ays, it did not

produce le&s;s than the value of 50,000<HI>l.</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>per annum,</HI> and that he, &s;aw a pearl taken out of it, that weighed fifty grains, and was perfectly &s;ound. But the large<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> that were u&s;ually met with in that &s;ea, did not weigh above ten or twelve grains; all above that weight, the fi&s;hermen were obliged to lay by for the King. Whether the pearl-banks are now exhau&s;ted, or the people are become inactive, cannot be &s;aid, but the pearl-fi&s;hery is now in di&s;u&s;e.</P>
<P>There are two &s;ea&s;ons for this fi&s;hing, the fir&s;t in March or April, and the other in Augu&s;t or September. At this time, no the oy&s;ter-banks, were to be &s;een 2000 or 3000 fi&s;hing boats, in every one of which was a diver. The&s;e boats being anchored in five fathom water, the diver &s;trips him&s;elf naked, and having fixed a piece of horn, like a pair of &s;pectacles, on his no&s;e, to prevent the water getting in that way, and tied a &s;tone to one of his feet, that he may &s;ink to the bottom, he takes a net, or a ba&s;ket with him, and de&s;cends to the bottom; a rope being fa&s;tened under his arms, and another to the ba&s;ket. When at the bottom, having &s;lipped off the cord which fa&s;tened the &s;tone to his foot, he gathers the oy&s;ters, or <HI>nacres,</HI> puts them in his ba&s;ket, and having remained under water as long as he can, gives a &s;ignal to the people in the boat, to draw him up, and after|wards they pull up the ba&s;ket. In the mean time, the diver refre&s;hes him&s;elf with a pipe and tobacco, and dives as before, thus working from eight in the morn|ing
<PB N="327" REF="340">
till eleven, and, after dinner, from twelve till three in the afternoon. It is &s;aid, the&s;e divers will continue under water, near half a quarter of an hour at a time. Towards evening, they carry their oy&s;ters on &s;hore, where they lay them in heaps, and when they begin to dry, the oy&s;ters open of them&s;elves, and the fi&s;hers di|ligently &s;earch for the pearls.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of their Animals.</HEAD>
<P>THERE being very little cover in the middle or &s;outhern part of Per&s;ia, there are not many wild bea&s;ts. Deer they have &s;ome, and antelopes, which are much of the &s;ame nature, except that they are &s;potted, and have finer limbs. But in the woody parts, as Hyr|cania, and Cardi&s;tan, there are lions, tygers, leopards, wild hogs, jackalls, &amp;c. Jackalls are &s;o very dome&s;tic, that <HI>Hanway</HI> &s;ays, whenever he encamped, they would run over his bed in the night, and being very fond of leather, he was afraid they would have run away with his accoutrements; and they make &s;uch a barking and howling in the woods, that there was no re&s;ting for them; and when one begins to howl, the whole pack
<PB N="328" REF="341">
does the &s;ame. The country about Hamadan, abounds in elks, which are as fleet as birds; no hor&s;e can reach them. The Per&s;ians call them <HI>Giran,</HI> and pretend, there is mu&s;k near their tails.</P>
<P>Among their cattle, we find camels, hor&s;es, mules, a&s;&s;es, oxen, and buffaloes, very &s;erviceable; but the camel, for a bea&s;t of burden, much excels all the re&s;t, whether we con&s;ider the weight he carries, the di&s;patch he makes, or the &s;mall expence of keeping him. Of the&s;e camels there are &s;everal kinds, &s;ome have two bunches upon their backs, and others but one, and there is a third &s;ort, engendered between a dromedary, which is a camel with two bunches, and a female with one, which are mo&s;t e&s;teemed, and &s;ell for 20<HI>l.</HI> or 30<HI>l.</HI> each; for the&s;e &s;eldom tire, and will carry 900, or 1,000 <HI>lb.</HI> Tho&s;e which travel between the Per&s;ian gulph, and I&s;|pahan, are of a much le&s;s &s;ize, and do not carry above 500 or 600 weight; but, notwith&s;tanding this, are almo&s;t as &s;erviceable as the other, being &s;wifter of foot, and will gallop like a hor&s;e, whereas the other &s;eldom go beyond a foot-pace. The&s;e &s;wift camels are kept by the King and great men, to convey their women from place to place, and carry their baggage. They are u&s;ually adorned with embroidered cloths, and &s;ilver-bells about their necks. A &s;tring of &s;ix or &s;even of them are tied together when they travel, and governed by one man. They u&s;e neither bridle or halter to hold them in, or whips to drive them, but are governed by
<PB N="329" REF="342">
the driver's voice, who &s;ings or plays to them, as they travel. It is in vain to beat them, if they tire; they never go the better for it. When they are to take up their burden, the driver touches their knees, on which they lie down on their bellies, till they are loaded, groan|ing, however, and giving &s;igns of unea&s;ine&s;s, under a &s;en&s;e of the fatigue which they are about to undergo. This animal is very ill-qualified to travel on the &s;now, or wet ground: they carry their legs &s;o wide apart, &s;ays <HI>Han|way,</HI> it often occa&s;ions their &s;plitting them&s;elves; &s;o that, when they fall with great burdens, they &s;eldom ri&s;e again. He met with &s;everal &s;keletons of camels &s;o killed, lying near the road, the fle&s;h of which had been devoured by wolves. In travelling they let them graze on the road-&s;ide, on weeds and thi&s;tles, with their burdens on their backs, and &s;ometimes feed them with balls of barley-meal and chaff made into a pa&s;te, with which they often mix the cotton-&s;eed. Con&s;idering the &s;ize of this animal, it is the &s;malle&s;t feeder of any bea&s;t; and it is a happy circum&s;tance that they will live without wa|ter two or three days together; for there is &s;carce any to be met with in tho&s;e de&s;arts the caravans are obliged to cro&s;s. They &s;hed their hair every &s;pring, and are per|fectly naked. Of camels hair abundance of &s;tuffs are made. They are very tame and tractable, except at rutting time, which la&s;ts 30 or 40 days; and then they are more unruly, which makes the drivers increa&s;e their loads to keep down their fle&s;h. When once a male has covered a female, he grows &s;luggi&s;h and unwilling to
<PB N="330" REF="343">
leave her. They copulate as other four-footed ani|mals do, except that the female lies down on her belly, as &s;he does to receive her load. They go eleven months with young.</P>
<P>Oxen, buffaloes, apes, and mules, are al&s;o u&s;ed indif|ferently for carrying of pa&s;&s;engers, or burdens; and their land being ploughed by buffaloes and oxen, the&s;e bea&s;ts are &s;eldom killed for food. The a&s;&s;es of Per&s;ia are much larger and &s;wifter than ours, and will perform a journey very well. But the fine&s;t bea&s;ts are their hor&s;es. The&s;e are beautiful creatures, and no where better managed than in Per&s;ia. The breed of hor&s;es in Fars is at pre|&s;ent very indifferent, owing to the ruinous &s;tate of the country, but in the province of Du&s;hti&s;ta&agrave;n, lying to the &s;outh-we&s;t, it is remarkably good. They have fine fore|heads, and are well proportioned, light, and &s;prightly, but only u&s;ed for the &s;addle. They are never gelt, and wear their tails at full length. Though they are lovely creatures to look on, they are neither &s;o &s;wift as the Ara|bian hor&s;es, nor &s;o hardy as the Tartars; and the King has always a &s;table of the Arabian breed. Hor&s;es are very dear in Per&s;ia, &s;ome of them being &s;old for two or three hundred pounds, and &s;eldom for le&s;s than fifty pounds each. It is not &s;o much their &s;carcity that occa|&s;ions this price, as the numbers that are &s;old to India and Turkey. They have mules al&s;o that carry very well, and are &s;old at 30 and 40 pounds a-piece; and a&s;&s;es, that are taught to pace, are valued at nearly as much.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="344">The common feed for hor&s;es is barley and chopped &s;traw. They have no mangers in their &s;tables, but give their hor&s;es corn in bags, as our hackney-coach|men do. In the &s;pring, they cut green gra&s;s for their hor&s;es, but never make any into hay. Sometimes they feed their hor&s;es with barley-meal balls, as in India. In|&s;tead of litter, their own dung is dried and beaten to powder, and laid a foot deep for them to lie on; and if any of it be wetted, it is dried in the &s;un the next day. Their hor&s;es' hoofs are much &s;ounder and harder than ours, and they are &s;hod (as are their oxen) with thin, light places.</P>
<P>They daub their hor&s;es legs in winter with the yellow herb Hannah, and &s;ometimes anoint their bodies with it as high as the brea&s;t, to keep out the cold, as they &s;ay; but it appears to be rather done by way of orna|ment; for in &s;ome places they do it all the year round.</P>
<P>The King has large &s;tables of hor&s;es, di&s;per&s;ed through|out the kingdom, almo&s;t in every city, for the public &s;ervice. A hor&s;e is &s;eldom refu&s;ed to any man that a&s;ks for one, if he can, and will, keep it; but then &s;uch per|&s;ons are accountable to government for them, when they &s;hall be called out; but till then they may ride them. The&s;e troopers hor&s;es are &s;ometimes quartered upon people again&s;t their con&s;ent; and if any hor&s;e dies in their hands, oath mu&s;t be made that it did not die for want of food or care.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="345">Of &s;heep and goats there are great plenty. The natives &s;eldom eat any other meat. The &s;heep at Shirauz are of a &s;uperior flavour, owing to the excel|lence of the pa&s;turage in that neighbourhood, and are remarkable for the finene&s;s of their fleece. They have broad flat tails, as in Tartary and &s;ome other places, &s;o large, that, Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> &s;ays, he has &s;een &s;ome that weighed more than 30 pounds; but tho&s;e which are &s;old in the markets don't weigh above &s;ix or &s;even pounds. [<HI>Such a &s;heep is repre&s;ented in the Kalmuck Smoking Party, p.</HI> 302, <HI>vol.</HI> II.] They are remarkable al&s;o in &s;ome parts of Per&s;ia for having more horns than ours. I have &s;een &s;ome, &s;ays <HI>Chardin,</HI> with &s;ix or &s;even horns, &s;ome &s;tand|ing &s;trait out of their foreheads; &s;o that when their rams engage, there is u&s;ually a great deal of blood &s;pilt in the battle. Per&s;ian goats are good eating, and their wool or hair is &s;o fine, that great quantities of it are exported. Hogs, there are &s;carce any; for, as the Mahomedans, who are the governing part of the nation, abhor this ani|mal, the Chri&s;tians do not endeavour to increa&s;e the breed, unle&s;s about Georgia and Armenia, where the Chri&s;tians are very numerous.</P>
<P>In&s;ects, they are not much troubled with in the heart of Per&s;ia, which is very dry, unle&s;s it be with &s;warms of locu&s;ts which &s;ometimes vi&s;it them: the&s;e fly in &s;uch numbers as to look like a cloud, and darken the &s;ky, and, wherever they alight, de&s;troy the fruits of the earth; but Providence has &s;o ordained it, that there are certain
<PB N="333" REF="346">
birds, which generally vi&s;it the country about the &s;ame time, eat up the locu&s;ts, and &s;o prevent the ruin of the hu&s;bandmen.</P>
<P>There are almo&s;t all the &s;ame &s;orts of tame and wild fowl in Per&s;ia as in Europe. Turkeys have been im|ported into I&s;pahan, but do not thrive there. Pigeons they take the utmo&s;t care to increa&s;e, on account of their dung, with which they rai&s;e their melons. Their dove|cots are five times as large ours, of around form, and hand|&s;omely built of brick; and of the&s;e, it is &s;aid, there are not le&s;s than 3,000 in the city of I&s;pahan alone. This dung is u&s;ually &s;old for 4<HI>d.</HI> the <HI>bi&s;ty,</HI> or 12 pounds weight; and government has laid a &s;mall tax upon it.</P>
<P>As to eagles, hawks, falcons, and other birds of prey, there is no country where they have more, or where they are better in&s;tructed to take the prey, than in Per&s;ia. The King has 800 or 1,000 of them; and there is no man of any figure, without his hawks and his falconer.</P>
<P>As there are &s;o few rivers, river-fi&s;h is very &s;carce, and &s;eldom eaten; but the Ca&s;pian &s;ea and the Per&s;ian gulph furni&s;h them with plenty of &s;ea-fi&s;h, of almo&s;t every kind.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Of their Cities.</HEAD>
<P>I PROCEED now to de&s;cribe &s;ome of their principal cities; and as I&s;pahan is the capital, we will begin with that.</P>
<P>I&s;pahan, or as it is pronounced, Spahawn, lies in 32 degrees 40 minutes north latitude, and 50 degrees ea&s;t longitude from London, It is &s;ituated in the pro|vince of Erack, which was the ancient Parthia, and now reckoned the principal province of the empire, being of very large extent, and almo&s;t in the centre of the Per&s;ian dominions. It &s;tands in a fine plain, almo&s;t &s;urrounded with mountains, which lie about two or three leagues from it, and the form is pretty oval. The river Senderhout runs by it, at about a mile di&s;tance; but there are &s;everal channels and pipes above the town, which convey the water from it into canals and ba&s;ons, for the u&s;e of the city. The town is without walls, and about ten or twelve miles in circuit. Some travellers have &s;aid it is ten leagues round, but they mu&s;t take in Julpha, a town on the other &s;ide of the river, about a mile from I&s;pahan, and about two miles &s;quare; the &s;treets are wider than tho&s;e of I&s;pahan, with trees planted in
<PB N="335" REF="348">
them, and gardens round the hou&s;es, &s;o that it re&s;embles a country village. It is inhabited by a colony of Ar|menians, though there are &s;ome Georgians, and &s;everal other Chri&s;tian inhabitants, and al&s;o &s;ome convents of Europeans, but no Mahomedans. But to return to I&s;pahan.</P>
<P>There were formerly twelve gates to the city, but four of them are now &s;hut up. The &s;treets are generally narrowand crooked, and either exceedingly dirty or du&s;ty, not being paved. Though there are no coaches or carts, yet all the people, of any di&s;tinction, riding through them, with great trains of &s;ervants, renders them very unplea&s;ant. There are, however, &s;ome very fine &s;quares in the town, particularly the <HI>Meydan,</HI> or Royal Square, into which opens two of the palace gates. On the &s;ides of this &s;quare, which is one-third of a mile in length, and more than half as much broad, are buildings much like the New Exchange in the Strand, London, a covered way, with &s;hops on both &s;ides, where every particular trade has a quarter a&s;&s;igned; and there is a &s;econd &s;tory, where mechanicks have their working &s;hops. There &s;eems to be little difference between the&s;e Exchanges and ours, except that tho&s;e of I&s;pahan have no windows, but great openings at proper di&s;tances to let in the light; and people ride through them as along the &s;treets. In the middle of the &s;quare there is a market for hor&s;es and cattle, and all manner of goods and eatables are expo&s;ed to &s;ale. On that &s;ide of the
<PB N="336" REF="349">
&s;quare next the palace, there is a fine row of trees, and a hand&s;ome ba&s;on of water: and &s;ome great bra&s;s guns, taken from the Portugue&s;e at Ormus, &s;erve to make a &s;how. At the &s;outh end of the &s;quare is a great mo&s;que, and another on the ea&s;t &s;ide, over again&s;t the great gate of the palace. Several &s;treets are covered and arched over, which makes them pretty dark, and this &s;eems to be peculiar to the Per&s;ian towns; as is, that their hou&s;es are at &s;ome di&s;tance from their &s;hops. It is a common thing for a trade&s;man to go half a mile in the morning to the <HI>bazar,</HI> or market-place, where his &s;hop is; and at night he locks up his valuable goods in che&s;ts and counters, and the re&s;t are left packed up in the open &s;quare; and &s;eldom is any thing lo&s;t, &s;o care|ful are the watch appointed to guard the market-place, and &s;o very little are the people, in this part of the world, given to thieving. Indeed the &s;peedy and exemplary puni&s;hments inflicted upon pilferers, is one great means to deter them from it.</P>
<P>Foreign merchants lodge their goods in the public caravan&s;eras, of which there are not le&s;s than 1,500 in the city of I&s;pahan. The&s;e are large buildings erected, from time to time, by charitable people for the u&s;e of &s;trangers, which &s;erve them al&s;o in&s;tead of inns for lodging and diet; but there is this difference between an inn and a caravan&s;era, that, in the la&s;t, every one finds his own bedding and cookery, whereas in the fir&s;t we have not that trouble. There are two things, however,
<PB N="337" REF="350">
that render a caravan&s;era preferable to an inn; one is, that a per&s;on is not &s;ubject to extortion, but buys his provi&s;ion at the be&s;t hand; and the other, that let the merchant take up ever &s;o many rooms, he is not di&s;|turbed in them, and pays but a trifle for warehou&s;e and lodging, and on the road he pays nothing. Mo&s;t of them are built on the &s;ame plan, and differ only in dimen&s;ions. There is a hand&s;ome portal at the entrance of each cara|van&s;era, on the &s;ides of which are &s;hops, from whence you enter into a quadrangle, round which there is a cloi&s;ter, or piazza, and within are lodging-rooms and warehou&s;es for goods. There is al&s;o &s;tabling and con|veniences for hor&s;es and other bea&s;ts on the out&s;ide, or they may be brought into the quadrangle, and there tied; which is common on the roads, where there is no danger of robbers. In &s;hort, both in the cities, and on the road, the&s;e caravan&s;eras are empty, unfurni&s;hed inns, which travellers may make u&s;e of at their plea&s;ure. Some have ba&s;ons of water in the centre of he qua|drangle.</P>
<P>As the Mahomedan religion prevents the u&s;e of wine, there are no taverns in I&s;pahan, though &s;ome of the Per&s;ians will drink pretty plentifully in private; but there are hand&s;ome coffee-hou&s;es in the principal parts of the town, where people meet and talk politics, though they have no printed news-papers. In &s;uch places we meet with &s;ome amu&s;ement peculiar to the country, as the harangues of their poets, hi&s;torians, and prie&s;ts,
<PB N="338" REF="351">
who hold forth and get a crowd about them, as Dr. Byfield, of comical memory, did formerly in London in the coffee-hou&s;es about the Exchange and Temple; and, it &s;eems, they expect a &s;mall pre&s;ent from their audi|ence for the entertainment.</P>
<P>The palace, with the gardens belonging to it, takes up above a league in compa&s;s. Over the two gates, which come up to the royal meydan, or &s;quare, is a gallery, where the Sophi or King u&s;ed to &s;it and &s;ee mar|tial exerci&s;es p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rformed on hor&s;eback. No part of the palace, where the court re&s;ides, reaches this &s;quare; but, having entered the principal gate, there is a hall or court-room on the left hand, where the vizier and other judges admini&s;ter ju&s;tice on certain days; and, on the right, are rooms where offenders are allowed to take &s;anctuary. From hence to the hall, where the King u&s;ually gives audience, is a hand&s;ome covered walk. It is a long room beautifully painted and gilt, and &s;up|ported by 40 pillars, divided into three parts, one a &s;tep higher than the other, on which the great officers &s;tand according to their rank. As to hereditary nobility, there is no &s;uch thing in Per&s;ia. On the third a&s;cent is the royal throne, rai&s;ed about a foot and a half from the floor, and about eight feet &s;quare, on which is &s;pread a rich carpet. Here the King &s;its cro&s;s-legged upon &s;o|lemn occa&s;ions, having a brocaded cu&s;hion under him, and another at his back. This is the only part of the palace which foreigners, can &s;ee; of the re&s;t, and particu|larly
<PB N="339" REF="352">
the haram, or women's apartments, as none but eunuchs are permitted to enter them, no exact de&s;crip|tion can be given; but they are &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t of &s;epa|rate plea&s;ure-hou&s;es, di&s;per&s;ed about the gardens, much in the &s;ame form with tho&s;e of per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, which I &s;hall de&s;cribe; and that their great beauty con&s;i&s;ts in fine walks, fountains, and ca&s;cades. Be|yond the garden the Sophi has a large park walled in, where the ladies hunt, and take their plea&s;ure with the prince.</P>
<P>I will endeavour to enliven this detail with &s;ome de&s;criptions of the royal harams in I&s;pahan. A thou&s;and fanciful things have been related, and merely on the &s;trength of imagination, re&s;pecting the&s;e places, which travellers have never been admitted to &s;ee; &s;ome par|ticulars, however, have been learned from the eunuchs and women, who frequent tho&s;e apartments, and furni&s;h the ladies with toys. From the&s;e we under&s;tand, that the women's quarter of the palace is the mo&s;t magnificent, and be&s;t furni&s;hed of the whole, the prince &s;pending the be&s;t part of his time here. It is &s;aid al&s;o, that the eco|nomy of this inward palace is much the &s;ame with the outer, and that the women have their &s;everal po&s;ts and employments here, as the men have in the other; that there are &s;tewards, &s;ecretaries, trea&s;urers, guards, &amp;c. all of the fair &s;ex; who&s;e cabals frequently embarra&s;s and fru&s;trate the be&s;t-laid de&s;igns of the mini&s;ters without.</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="353">In the haram there are three ranks of women; fir&s;t, prince&s;&s;es which are born there, whom they call <HI>Begum,</HI> as they do the prince&s;&s;es of the blood-royal in the court of the Mogul: &s;econd, tho&s;e by whom the King has any children, or who are his mi&s;|tre&s;&s;es, the&s;e have the title of <HI>Canum,</HI> corre&s;ponding to that of <HI>Chan,</HI> or <HI>Khan,</HI> among the men: and, third, tho&s;e whom the king has never taken to his embraces, and many of whom he &s;carcely knows, the&s;e are called <HI>Katun,</HI> or ladies only. All the re&s;t have the appellation of &s;laves, and are employed in &s;ervile of|fices.</P>
<P>In the royal haram are &s;everal di&s;tinct buildings, which have no communication with each other. When a King dies, tho&s;e ladies with whom he has conver&s;ed as wives, are &s;hut up in a quarter by them&s;elves, from whence they are not permitted to &s;tir out as long as they live, unle&s;s it be the mother of the &s;ucceeding prince, who has generally great influence in affairs, and almo&s;t a &s;overeign authority within the limits of the haram.</P>
<P>When a &s;on or brother of the King's is marriageable, he generally gives him the choice of a mi&s;tre&s;s among the ladies of the haram, and &s;ometimes of two or more, according to the love he bears him; he gives him al&s;o &s;uch a number of dome&s;tics as are &s;uitable to his rank, con&s;i&s;ting of female &s;laves and eunuchs, and an apart|ment
<PB N="341" REF="354">
in the palace, where he remains confined. The mothers of the&s;e princes and their &s;ervants generally re|tire with them to keep them company; for the&s;e princes are never after to have any conver&s;ation with the re&s;t of the haram, without the King's leave. If they are ever known to have an intrigue with any other ladies, than tho&s;e they have made choice of, it is fatal to both parties: a &s;ingle glance only, is as much as their lives are worth. And what is &s;till wor&s;e, they are excluded from the con|ver&s;ation of all men, except the eunuchs, who are placed about them; &s;o that &s;hould they &s;ucceed to the crown, they are as ignorant of all worldly affairs, as if they had ju&s;t dropped from the clouds. As to the young prin|ce&s;&s;es, their mothers generally u&s;e their intere&s;t with the King to get them married, as &s;oon as they are of a proper age.</P>
<P>There are a great variety of beauties confined in the King of Per&s;ia's haram, for the chans and governors are continually &s;ending up a fre&s;h &s;upply of young virgins from all parts of his dominions. If they hear of a beautiful girl in any family, they immediately demand her; and her parents are not much aver&s;e to parting with her, but are rather proud they have an opportunity of obliging their prince, e&s;pecially as it may be a means of rai&s;ing the whole family. For whenever a young per|&s;on enters the haram, a pen&s;ion is &s;ettled on her neare&s;t relation. If &s;he becomes a confidant, or mi&s;tre&s;s to the King, the pen&s;ion is increa&s;ed; and if he has children
<PB N="342" REF="355">
by her, &s;he &s;eldom fails to procure the advancement of all her relations. In the haram are the daughters of &s;ome of the governors of provinces, and the greate&s;t lords of the court; but there are many more Georgians and Circa&s;&s;ian women of meaner birth, the&s;e being &s;aid to excel the re&s;t of the world in beauty, and &s;ome of the&s;e generally captivate the young monarch's heart.</P>
<P>What is reported of the unnatural and cruel practices in the haram is very &s;hocking. So long as the King is without children, every one of his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es is de&s;irous of having one, in hopes that their i&s;&s;ue will &s;ucceed to the crown, in which their happine&s;s very much depends; but when they find the King has &s;everal children, they do all they can to prevent having them, or to procure abortion; for, except the fir&s;t happy woman that has a child, the re&s;t, after they have any, are confined to an apartment, where they live in perpetual apprehen&s;ion of having their children murdered; or, at lea&s;t, deprived of &s;ight, upon barbarous maxims of &s;tate, that there may be no competitors for the crown, as a blind-man is not permitted to reign. This cruelty &s;eldom fails to be executed &s;ooner or later, either in the reign of the pre|&s;ent King, or that of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>Hence it is, that the ladies of the haram dread nothing &s;o much as having children. Their principal aim is to be married to &s;ome great man; which they &s;ometimes
<PB N="343" REF="356">
accompli&s;h by in&s;inuating them&s;elves into the good graces of the King's mother, the mother of his elde&s;t &s;on, or the King him&s;elf. The King's mother holds a con&s;tant corre&s;pondence with the mini&s;ters of &s;tate, who frequently de&s;ire her to be&s;tow on them one of the ladies of the haram, in hopes of advancing their intere&s;t at court; and happy is &s;he who is thus given to a great man, as &s;he thereby becomes a wife, according to the Per&s;ian law, is mi&s;tre&s;s of his hou&s;e, and is treated as the daughter of a King.</P>
<P>The women of the haram, when they grow too nu|merous, are &s;ometimes al&s;o married to clear the palace, and le&s;&s;en the expence; but tho&s;e who have been with child by the King, are &s;eldom, if ever, &s;ent out of the haram, which is one rea&s;on they are not very fond of his favours. Abbas II. who reigned in the middle of the la&s;t century, it is &s;aid, cau&s;ed one of his beloved mi&s;tre&s;&s;es to be burnt alive, becau&s;e &s;he &s;lighted his embraces. He &s;ent her word, it &s;eems, one evening, that he de&s;igned to have her company that night; to which &s;he an&s;wered, that &s;he was not in a &s;tate fit to approach his maje&s;ty, on account of a certain indi&s;po&s;ition. The King, therefore, deferred his vi&s;it, but went to &s;ee her the next morning, and find|ing that &s;he had deceived him, he &s;lew into a pa&s;&s;ion, and ordering a fire to be made, cau&s;ed her to be burnt in his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="357">The guards of the haram are compo&s;ed of three dif|ferent bodies, 1. The white eunuchs, who guard the outer gate. The&s;e never come within &s;ight of the wo|men, le&s;t it &s;hould incite in them an amorous inclination. 2. The black eunuchs. The&s;e are generally from the coa&s;t of Malabar. Their &s;tation is in the &s;econd court, and the olde&s;t and mo&s;t deformed of the&s;e are &s;elected to attend the ladies, and carry me&s;&s;ages to and fro. The re&s;t are employed either in the gardens, kitchens, or other places remote from the women's apartments. 3. The third and innermo&s;t guard, it is &s;aid, are com|po&s;ed of women, commanded by &s;ome antiquated ma|tron, who receives orders from the prince him&s;elf, and conveys his maje&s;ty's commands by the eunuchs which attend, to the guards without.</P>
<P>The women of the haram are all lodged in &s;eparate chambers, or, at mo&s;t, two in one room, in which ca&s;e they put an old woman and a young one together.</P>
<P>The ladies of one apartment are not &s;uffered to vi&s;it tho&s;e of another, without leave. This is to prevent quarrels among rival mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, or, as &s;ome &s;ay, left they &s;hould fall in love with each other, and be guilty of in|decent familiarities, which is not uncommon in the Ea&s;t, where they are &s;o &s;trictly kept from the conver&s;ation of men. The women who frequent the haram, report &s;ur|pri&s;ing things of the pa&s;&s;ion the&s;e young women have for each other, of the jealou&s;ies they entertain of their
<PB N="345" REF="358">
rivals, and of the plots and con&s;piracies of one favou|rite mi&s;tre&s;s again&s;t another. Tho&s;e who delight the King mo&s;t with their &s;inging, their dancing, or their wit, are &s;ure to become the envy of the re&s;t; and the King is not a little troubled &s;ometimes with their con|trivances to betray and &s;upplant one another. When he is provoked, he will order one to be confined, another to be beaten, and a third, perhaps, from a favourite, is turned among the common &s;laves. Nay, he proceeds &s;o far &s;ometimes as to put them to death, &s;o that a &s;e|raglio, or haram, is far from being that earthly paradi&s;e &s;ome are apt to imagine.</P>
<P>It is reported al&s;o, that the greate&s;t part of the royal infants are put to death as &s;oon as born, to prevent their being too numerous. The King's mother has the di|rection of the&s;e matters; and her orders are executed, without the lea&s;t horror or remor&s;e. She is, as it were, the governe&s;s of all her &s;on's mi&s;tre&s;&s;es and favourites: their fortune, and that of their children &s;eems to be en|tirely in her hands, and it is not ea&s;y for them, without her, to pre&s;erve the King's affection long. The King is never formally married to any of his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, but takes which of the ladies he plea&s;es to his bed, without any manner of ceremony. Tho&s;e he is intimate with, are but a &s;mall number. The others indeed, &s;ing, dance, and play, before him, and contribute to his plea&s;ures in another manner; but, from the di&s;tractions he meets with in a variety of con&s;orts, he frequently fixes upon &s;ome
<PB N="346" REF="359">
one, who may properly enough be &s;tiled, the Queen of the Haram. Amid &s;uch a number of rival beauties, the prince is &s;en&s;ible he can have but the hearts of a very few, and &s;he whom he mo&s;t admires, perhaps has lea&s;t affection to his per&s;on. Happy is the lady whom the King admires, and can make him believe &s;he has an equal pa&s;&s;ion for him!</P>
<P>The ladies of the Haram never vi&s;it out of the palace, but receive the vi&s;its of their female relations: and it is ob&s;erved, in general, throughout Per&s;ia, that tho&s;e of the greate&s;t quality of that &s;ex, &s;tir the lea&s;t from home, &s;carce ever going abroad, but on &s;ome extraordinary occa&s;ion, as to a wedding, a lying-in, or upon &s;ome fe&s;|tival: but when they do go, their vi&s;its u&s;ually la&s;t &s;even or eight hours. They take with them their &s;he-&s;laves and eunuchs, and the hu&s;band, u&s;ually &s;ends a gover|nante and eunuchs of his own, to ob&s;erve their con|duct.</P>
<P>As the&s;e ladies follow the King to his other palaces, or to camp in time of war, they travel always in the night. A troop of hor&s;e u&s;ually marches a hundred paces before them, and another troop in the rear, crying out, <HI>Courouc, Courouc,</HI> by which every man more than &s;even years of age, under&s;tands he is to retire to a proper di&s;tance. The eunuchs with their batons al&s;o on hor&s;eback, march between the guards and the women, and if any man is found in the way, or within the limits prohibited, he is
<PB N="347" REF="360">
put to death. If they march through a city, the men in the &s;treet through which they pa&s;s, and tho&s;e adjoin|ing, are all obliged to leave their hou&s;es, and fly to &s;ome other part of the town, as tho&s;e of the villages are, for a league together, on the right and left of the road through which they are to march; and a detachment of dragoons is u&s;ually &s;ent half a day before, to drive them away. They fire a mu&s;quet at little intervals, to give notice of their approach, and all men that hear it, fly as fa&s;t as they can. And it is &s;aid, there are frequent examples of men being killed by the eunuchs, who have not been wi&s;e enough, or fortunate enough, to get out of the way in time.</P>
<P>In the city of I&s;pahan, are above 150 Mahomedan mo&s;ques or temples, covered with domes or cupolas, which, appearing through the trees that are planted al|mo&s;t all over the town, in the &s;treets or gardens, afford an agreeable pro&s;pect; but the common buildings are &s;o low, as &s;carce to be di&s;cernable by one who takes a view of the town from without.</P>
<P>As no Chri&s;tian is admitted within their mo&s;ques, it is not ea&s;y to meet with a particular de&s;cription of them. Tho&s;e who have &s;een the great mo&s;que of I&s;pahan, in di&s;gui&s;e, tell us, there is a gate leading to it, covered with &s;ilver plates. Through this, we proceed to a qua|drangle, with a piazza on each &s;ide, where the prie&s;ts lodge who belong to the mo&s;que. In the centre, is a large
<PB N="348" REF="361">
ba&s;on of water, where the people wa&s;h them&s;elves before they enter the temple. In this &s;puare, oppo&s;ite the great gate, are three large doors, which open into it. The whole building con&s;i&s;ts of five ai&s;les, beautified with gold and azure. In the middle is the cupola, &s;up|ported by four, great, &s;quare pillars. The ai&s;les, on the &s;ides, are lower than the middle one, and borne up, by thick columns of free-&s;tone. Two great windows to|wards the top of the middle ai&s;le, give light to the whole mo&s;que. On the left, towards the middle, &s;tands a kind of pulpit, with &s;tone-&s;teps to go up to it. There are no &s;eats or pews, as in Chri&s;tian churches, or any kind of imagery or pictures; but the floor is carpeted, and all per|&s;ons put off their &s;hoes on entering. The walls within, are lined 15 feet high, with white poli&s;hed marble. The building without, is &s;tone, but painted with varni&s;h-colours, and on the cupola, is a tower where the prie&s;ts go up to &s;ummon the people to their devotion; for no bells are made u&s;e of.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Franklin,</HI> who got admi&s;&s;ion, in di&s;gui&s;e, into the chief mo&s;que at Shirauz, and who is mo&s;t to be relied on, gives the following de&s;cription of it; and as the&s;e tem|ples throughout the country are &s;imilar to each other, one de&s;cription will &s;erve for all. It is of a &s;quare form; in the centre is a &s;tone re&s;ervoir of water, made for per|forming the nece&s;&s;ary ablutions, or wa&s;hings, previous to prayer. On the four &s;ides of the building are arched apartments, allotted for devotions, &s;ome of the fronts of
<PB N="349" REF="362">
which are covered with china tiles, others with a blue and white enamelled work. Within the&s;e rece&s;&s;es or apartments, on the walls on each &s;ide, are various &s;en|tences engraved from the Koran, in the Nu&s;khi character; and at the upper end of the &s;quare, is a large dome with a cupola at top. This is the place appropriated for the devotion of the Vakeel or regent. It is lined through|out with white marble, ornamented with curious blue and gold, artificial lapis lazuli, and has three large &s;ilver lamps &s;u&s;pended from the centre of the dome. Here <HI>Mullahs,</HI> or prie&s;ts, are con&s;tantly employed in reading the Koran. This mo&s;que has very good detached apart|ments, with places for ablutions and other religious cere|monies; and, at a little di&s;tance, on the out&s;ide, are a range of hand&s;ome buildings, inhabited by Mullahs, Dervi&s;es, and other religious men.</P>
<P>There are here, a number of hummums or bagnios; &s;ome of the&s;e are &s;quare buildings, but mo&s;t of them round, built with white poli&s;hed &s;tone, and covered with tiles, painted blue. The in&s;ide is divided into many re|ce&s;&s;es or chambers, &s;ome for plea&s;ure, and others for &s;weating; and the floors are laid with black and white marble. The Per&s;ians bathe almo&s;t every day, con&s;i|dering it as healthy, and an effectual remedy for colds and other di&s;orders.</P>
<P>But what is admired as much by foreigners, as any thing about I&s;pahan, is the Charbag. This is a walk
<PB N="350" REF="363">
above 100 yards wide, and a mile long, reaching from the city to the river. On each &s;ide are planted double rows of trees, and in the middle runs a canal, not conti|nued on a level; but at the di&s;tance of every furlong, the water falls into a large ba&s;on, forming a ca&s;cade. The &s;ides, both of the canal and ba&s;ons, are lined with hewn &s;tone, broad enough for &s;everal men to walk a-brea&s;t. On each &s;ide of this walk, are the royal gardens, and tho&s;e of great men, with plea&s;ure-hou&s;es, at a &s;mall di&s;tance; and the whole together, forms as agreeable a place and pro&s;pect, as can be conceived.</P>
<P>At the end of this walk is a bridge over the river, which leads to Julpha. There are al&s;o two other bridges, one on the right, and the other on the left, by which the neighbouring villages have a communication with the city. The architecture of the&s;e bridges is uncom|mon. This river is not navigable, though, in &s;pring, owing to the melting of the &s;nows on the mountains, it is almo&s;t as broad as the Thames at London, yet in &s;ummer the channel is exceedingly narrow and &s;hallow, &s;carce &s;ufficient to &s;upply the city with water. Now, not being navigable, the arches of the bridges are not very high, and on each &s;ide, both above and below, are covered pa&s;&s;ages through which people ride from one end of the bridge to the other, as in the covered &s;treets of the city; and at little di&s;tances there are openings to admit of light.</P>
<P><PB N="351" REF="364">Sir <HI>John Chardin</HI> tells us, the Ea&s;t-India Company had a factory at I&s;pahan, but being &s;o harra&s;&s;ed and oppre&s;&s;ed in the civil wars, the Company ordered their &s;ervants to retire to Bo&s;&s;ora, the territory of which is governed by its own prince, but tributary to the Grand Signior. This city &s;tands on the Tigris, two days journey below Bagdat. Owing to the&s;e wars, out of 100,000 magnificent hou&s;es in I&s;pahan only 5,000 are now inhabited; and among the&s;e are 57 colleges of royal foundations. Another rea&s;on of the hou&s;es going to ruin is, that every generation chu&s;es to build new hou&s;es to live in, and of cour&s;e never repair tho&s;e of their ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es of per&s;ons of quality are generally built in the middle of a fine garden, and make little or no ap|pearance in the &s;treets. We &s;ee nothing but a dead wall, with a great gate in the middle, and perhaps a &s;creen or wall within the gate, to prevent per&s;ons looking in: &s;o fond are they of privacy and retirement; far from our method of building, where we lay our country-&s;eats as open as po&s;&s;ible, and &s;eem to intimate, that there is no enjoyment in the fine&s;t palaces, but what re&s;ults from the admiration of the crowd that pa&s;&s;es by our gates. Their hou&s;es have but one floor, laid out as follows: In the front of the hou&s;e &s;tands the <HI>virando,</HI> being a little piazza open before, where they &s;it and tran&s;act their com|mon affairs; beyond this is a large hall, the <HI>divan,</HI> 18 or 20 feet high, u&s;ed at great entertainments, or on any &s;olemn occa&s;ions. On the farther &s;ide of the hou&s;e is
<PB N="352" REF="365">
another <HI>virando,</HI> with a ba&s;on, a fountain of water be|fore it, beyond which runs a walk of fine trees, as there does al&s;o from the &s;treet to the hou&s;e. At each corner of the hall is a parlour, or lodging-room (for it &s;erves both purpo&s;es occa&s;ionally). Between the&s;e parlours on the &s;ides there are doors out of the hall into an open &s;quare &s;pace, as large as the rooms are at the corners. There are al&s;o &s;everal doors out of the hall into the <HI>virando,</HI> before and behind the hou&s;e; &s;o that in hot weather they can &s;et open nine or ten doors at once in the great hall to give air. In &s;ome palaces there is a ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ome ba&s;on, and a fountain playing, in the middle of the hall, which contributes &s;till more to its coolne&s;s. The walls of their hou&s;es are built &s;ometimes of burnt bricks, but mo&s;t commonly of bricks dried in the &s;un. The walls are of con&s;iderable thickne&s;s, and the roof of the great hall is arched, and five or &s;ix feet higher than the other rooms about it. The roofs of the buildings, on every &s;ide of the hall, are flat, with a ballu&s;trade round them; and there is a pair of &s;tairs up to the top, where the family walks in the cool of the day, and &s;ometimes carry up a matra&s;s, and lie there all night. The kitchens, and other offices are at a di&s;tance on the right and left, and all their rooms, except the hall, &s;tand detached from each other, having no pa&s;&s;age from one to another, ex|cept from the hall. There are &s;ome few chimnies, but in general, in&s;tead of a chimney, the rooms have a round hole, about four or five feet diameter, and a foot and a half deep, in the middle of the room, in which a
<PB N="353" REF="366">
charcoal fire is made, and the place covered with a thick board or table about a foot high, &s;o clo&s;e that no &s;moke can get out; and over this table is thrown a large carpet, under which they put their legs in cold weather, and &s;it round, there being a pa&s;&s;age for the &s;moke by pipes under the floor.</P>
<P>The doors of their hou&s;es are narrow, and &s;eldom turn upon hinges, but there is a round piece left at the top and bottom of the door, which are let into a frame above and below, on which they turn; and the very locks and bolts are frequently made of wood. Their furniture con&s;i&s;ts only of carpets &s;pread on the floor, with cu&s;hions and pillows to lean on; and at night a matra&s;s is brought to &s;leep on, and a quilt or two to cover them, but very &s;eldom any &s;heets. The Per&s;ians lay in their under|garments. Servants lie about in any pa&s;&s;age on mats, and take up but little room. The floors are either paved or made up of a hard cement, on which they lay a coar&s;e cloth, and over that a carpet. The &s;ides of the rooms are lined, about three feet high, with fine tiles not unlike the Dutch tiles, and the re&s;t of the wall painted or hung with pictures. The hou&s;es of the inferior peo|ple are built on the &s;ame plan, as much like tho&s;e I have de&s;cribed as they can afford, and the palaces of princes are only more lofty and more magnificent.</P>
<P>In the city of Ca&s;bin, <HI>Hanway</HI> &s;ays, the aivan or hall, has niches in the wall or rece&s;&s;es, which an&s;wers

the purpo&s;e of tables. The floors are covered with large wor&s;ted carpets; and round the &s;ides are felts made with wool or camel's hair, very &s;oft and thick, about three feet wide, and from &s;even to nine long, placed there to &s;it on. In this hall the family &s;its, when they do not retire to the women's apartments, where no man but the ma&s;ter of it is admitted. The haram, or women's apartment is, generally, for the &s;ake of privacy, entered by two turnings. This city &s;tands on very high land, though a plain, and &s;urrounded by mountains, and the hou&s;es in general, of which only 1,100 are inhabited out of 12,000, the re&s;t being in ruins, or are &s;unk below the &s;urface of the earth, as are many of the gardens ad|joining them, for the convenience of being on a level with the water brought to Ca&s;bin in channels from a con&s;iderable di&s;tance. They are built with &s;un-dried bricks, and cemented with &s;trong lime; the re&s;t are flat, and the family in &s;ummer-time often &s;leep on the top of them. The&s;e buildings are enclo&s;ed with a mud-wall.</P>
<P>There is a palace in this city built about 40 years ago, which <HI>Hanway</HI> thus de&s;cribes. The entrance is formed by an avenue of lofty trees, near 300 yards long, and 15 or 20 broad; the wall round it is about a mile and a half Engli&s;h, in circumference, thick and lofty, having one entrance, an arched gate. Within the gate are four large &s;quares, with lofty trees, fountains, and running water, which makes the place awful and ma|je&s;tic.
<PB N="355" REF="368">
The apartments are rai&s;ed about &s;ix feet from the ground. The aivan, or open hall, is in the centre, and &s;hut in with falling doors. The apartments are ornamented in an Indian ta&s;te, and the cielings formed into &s;mall &s;quares embelli&s;hed with writings, of moral &s;entences, in very legible characters. Mo&s;t of the windows are of thick coloured gla&s;s, made tran&s;parent, and painted with &s;uch art, and in &s;uch proper &s;hades, that the gla&s;s &s;eems cut into the &s;everal figures it is de&s;igned to repre&s;ent. Many of the floors are only of hard earth, and others of a compo&s;ition of beaten &s;tone, and all covered with carpeting.</P>
<P>The haram of this palace is magnificent, con&s;i&s;ting of a &s;quare &s;urrounded by brick walls, about 30 feet high, and two feet and a half thick. Within are four di&s;tinct apartments, in &s;ome of which are fountains to give coolne&s;s and refre&s;h the air. The rooms are lined with &s;tucco-work, painted in the Indian ta&s;te, with birds and flowers of different magnitude; the colours beautiful, and &s;et off with gilt edges. The aparments have &s;mall chimney-pieces in a mean ta&s;te, and &s;ome are orna|mented with looking-gla&s;&s;es, in &s;mall &s;quares of many different dimen&s;ions &s;et into the walls. There are al&s;o &s;ome few apartments below ground admirably contrived for coolne&s;s. Near the haram is the eunuchs' apart|ment, remarkable for having but one door, and that a very &s;trong one. This new palace is built adjoining to the old one, of which &s;ome few of the apartments are
<PB N="356" REF="369">
&s;till &s;tanding, and ornamented with &s;ome bad pieces of European figures by European painters. The Per&s;ians them&s;elves are as ignorant of &s;hades as the Chine&s;e: the apartments where the Shah, or King kept his Ca&s;bin trea&s;ury, Mr. <HI>Hanway</HI> was not permitted to &s;ee, nor even the place where it &s;tood; but he was told it contained above 20,000,000 of crowns, or four millions of our money; and that part of it was in large ingots of gold, run into cavities in the earth, the better to &s;ecure it from plunder.</P>
<P>Ca&s;bin is enclo&s;ed within a wall above a mile in each &s;quare &s;ide, with a great number of regular turrets and port-holes for arrows. It is renowned in hi&s;tory, as being one of the chief cities of ancient Parthia, the re&s;idence of many of the Per&s;ian Kings, and the burial place of Ephe&s;|tion, the favourite of Alexander the Great. Here is a very noted caravan&s;era, with a large entrance and mag|nificent dome, which co&s;t 27,000 crowns.</P>
<P>At A&s;hreef, on the Ca&s;pian &s;ea, is another palace. Over the gate, which forms the entrance, are the arms of Per&s;ia, viz. a lion, with the &s;un ri&s;ing behind it, alluding to the &s;trength and glory of the Per&s;ian monarchy. Within this gate is a long avenue, on each &s;ide of which are 30 apartments intended for a royal guard. The next gate in front opens into a garden, in the middle of which is a canal made with &s;tone about three feet wide, and one deep, in which runs a &s;tream of water, which has four
<PB N="357" REF="370">
falls about an ell high, 30 yards di&s;tant from each other, each having a &s;mall ba&s;on and fountain. The&s;e falls mu&s;t have a fine effect; for, on the &s;ide near the &s;tream, holes are cut to fix candles at equal di&s;tances, to the num|ber of about 1000. At the head of the&s;e is a large &s;tone ba&s;on, about &s;ix feet deep. In the building near this ba&s;on, is a &s;umptuous aivan, or hall, painted with gold flowers, on a blue ground, very well executed. Here are al&s;o &s;everal portraits, &s;eem to have been done by a Hollander, but no ma&s;terly hand: on the &s;ides of the aivan are &s;everal &s;mall apartments, and behind it, three other ca&s;cades, falling down the &s;ide of a &s;teep mountain covered with wood.</P>
<P>The garden con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in walks, bordered by very large pines, orange and other fruit-trees di&s;per&s;ed in beds, with &s;treams of water running between them. Hence, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Hanway,</HI> I was carried into another garden much in the &s;ame ta&s;te, in which &s;tood the haram. There was no per&s;on in it; yet, being the women's apart|ment, it was con&s;idered as &s;acred, and we were not per|mitted to enter it. Before it was a large ba&s;on of water, and a &s;quare with marble benches at each corner. A &s;ycamore tree of a prodigious &s;ize, in the centre &s;haded the whole with its extended branches. Here were al&s;o ca&s;cades as before. Thence we were conducted to a banquetting-hou&s;e, which was dedicated to a grand&s;on of <HI>Ali.</HI> Out of re&s;pect to this place, we were de&s;ired to leave our &s;words at the door. The &s;olemnity with which
<PB N="358" REF="371">
we were conducted &s;truck me with a kind of religious awe; but this was &s;oon changed into contempt, for the rooms were adorned with paintings, that could only plea&s;e a voluptuous Mahomedan, all executed by a European hand, but ill done. The room had no furniture, but a number of rich carpets, at that time, piled up in great heaps.</P>
<P>We were &s;hewn a fourth hou&s;e and garden, in which was the &s;pring that gave water to the greate&s;t part of the whole. In this was a &s;tately dome, who&s;e top was in|differently well painted, and the walls were covered with Dutch tiles, as high as the gallery. At &s;ome di&s;tance from thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, is a &s;mall building &s;eemingly intended for an ob&s;ervatory. The whole commands a view of a very fine country, the Ca&s;pian &s;ea, being about five miles di&s;tance; and a di&s;tant pro&s;pect of the great mountain Demoan, on which the Per&s;ians &s;ay, the ark re&s;ted, though the Armenians a&s;cribe this honour to mount Ararat, which is here al&s;o vi&s;ible in clear weather. The vicinity of the mountains on the back of this palace, the nu|merous ca&s;cades, and the mu&s;ic of the birds, gave me many plea&s;ing ideas; but the unhappy &s;ituation of the people from the mi&s;eries of acivil war, and the di&s;po&s;itions of a tyrant, &s;till returned to my thoughts, blunted the edge of that I might otherwi&s;e have received.</P>
<P>Shirauz is the &s;econd city in magnitude in all Per&s;ia. It is the capital of the province of Fars, and lies in the latitude 29 degrees, 30 minutes, about 200 miles &s;outh
<PB N="359" REF="372">
of I&s;pahan. Tradition &s;ays, Cyrus the great and foun|der of the Per&s;ian empire was here buried, and it was thence called Shirauz. It is &s;ituated in a valley of great extent and &s;urprizing fertility. This valley is 26 miles long, and 12 broad, and is &s;urrounded on all &s;ides by mountains. The city, in circumference, is one <HI>fur&s;eng</HI> and 60 mea&s;ured paces; each fur&s;eng, four Engli&s;h miles: it is well fortified con&s;idering the country. A wall ex|tends quite round the city, 25 feet high, and 10 thick, with round towers at the di&s;tance of 80 paces from each other. It has a mo&s;t excellent ditch round it, made but a few years pa&s;t, 60 feet deep, and 20 broad. This alone, exclu&s;ive of the other works, would enable the city, to hold out a long time again&s;t any power in Per&s;ia, where artillery is but little known and le&s;s u&s;ed.</P>
<P>The city has &s;ix gates guarded by 100 men each, and four officers, who every morning and evening attend at the citadel to pay their compliments to the <HI>Khan,</HI> or King, or, in his ab&s;ence, to the <HI>Beglerbeg,</HI> or him next in rank. It is the duty of the&s;e guards, to prevent all per&s;ons leaving the city without a pa&s;s; and if any per&s;on ob|noxious to government, e&s;capes, the officer's head an|&s;wers for it. The gates are &s;hut at &s;un-&s;et, and opened at &s;un-ri&s;e, before which time, no one can go out or come in.</P>
<P>At the upper end of the city, &s;tands the citadel, built of burnt brick, a &s;quare of 80 yards circumference,
<PB N="360" REF="373">
flanked with round towers, and encompa&s;&s;ed with a dry fo&s;&s;e, of the &s;ame breadth and depth as that of the city; Here, Jaafer Khan, the King of the &s;outhern provinces, re&s;ides. It al&s;o &s;erves occa&s;ionally, as a &s;tate pri&s;on. Oppo&s;ite to the citadel, in a large hand&s;ome &s;quare, is a gallery, where the Khan's mu&s;ic, con&s;i&s;ting of trumpets, kettle-drums, and other in&s;truments, plays regularly at &s;un-ri&s;e and &s;un-&s;et. When the Khan is in camp, or on a journey, they are always placed in a tent near him. One &s;ide of this &s;quare leads to the <HI>Dew&agrave;n Kh&agrave;na,</HI> a chamber of audience; and the other leads up to the great mo&s;que. This chamber is a very hand&s;ome building &s;ituated at the upper end of a large garden, to which you are conducted through an avenue planted on each &s;ide, with a Per&s;ian tree, a &s;pecies of the &s;ycamore. The room is of an oblong form, with an open front, the in&s;ide, about one third up the wall, lined with white marble from Tauris, and the cieling and other parts, ornamented with a beautiful, gold, enamelled work, in imitation of lapis lazuli. There are &s;everal portraits in it, tolerably well executed and good likene&s;&s;es. In front, there are three hand&s;ome fountains, with &s;tone ba&s;ons con&s;tantly playing.</P>
<P>In the great &s;quare before the citadel, is the <HI>Tope Kh&agrave;na,</HI> or p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> of artillery. This con&s;i&s;ts of &s;everal pieces of cannon mounted on bad carriages. Mo&s;t of the guns (which are Spani&s;h and Portugue&s;e, excepting
<PB N="361" REF="374">
two Engli&s;h 20 pounders) are &s;o dreadfully honey|combed, that they would certainly bur&s;t, on the fir&s;t di&s;charge.</P>
<P>The city has many good bazars and caravan&s;eras. The great market is a covered &s;treet, about a quarter of a mile long, built entirely of brick, and roofed &s;ome|thing in the &s;tile of the Piazzas in Covent Garden, lofty, and well made. On each &s;ide are &s;hops, in which a variety of goods are expo&s;ed to &s;ale. The&s;e &s;hops are the pro|perty of the Khan, who rents them to the merchants at a very ea&s;y monthly rate. There are different bazars in Shirauz, for different companies of artificers, &s;uch as gold&s;miths, workers of tin, dyers, carpenters, joiners, hatters, and &s;hoemakers.

<P>The Jews of Shirauz have a quarter allotted to them, for which they pay a large tax to government, and are obliged to make con&s;iderable pre&s;ents. The&s;e peo|ple are more odious to the Per&s;ians, than tho&s;e of any other faith; and every opportunity is taken to oppre&s;s and extort money from them; the very boys in the &s;treet being accu&s;tomed to beat and in&s;ult them, of which treatment they dare not complain. The Indians have a caravan&s;era allowed them in another quarter of the city, for which they are al&s;o under contributions. There is a mint at Shirauz, where money is coined in the name of Jaafar Khan the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. Here the public

<P>By the words, <HI>pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or,</HI> I would be under&s;tood to &s;ay, that this nobleman now reigns as King of Per&s;ia, in Shirauz, though another competitor for the crown, a eunuch, has taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the northern part of the kingdom; for, &s;ince the death of Kerim Khan in 1779, an officer in Nadir Shah's &s;ervice, who, after two years civil wars from the death of Nadir, &s;eated him&s;elf on the throne, and had reigned peaceably and unmole&s;ted for 30 years, re&s;iding at Shirauz, under the title of Vakeel or regent, for he would never be called <HI>Shah,</HI> and who had took great pains to re&s;tore Per&s;ia to its former &s;plendor. The country has been torn by civil wars, ari&s;ing from &s;undry claimants to the throne; and as, when Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> was at Shirauz in 1787, there were two reigning Kings in Per&s;ia, and the&s;e were at war with each other, there was but little hopes of the country's recovering from the ruin|ous &s;tate it has long been in, for &s;ome time to come. To &s;hew the tyrannical di&s;po&s;ition of the Per&s;ian mo|narchs, we need only give, from Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI>'s work, a &s;hort detail of Zikea Khan's conduct, who u&s;urped the throne on the death of Kerim Khan.</P>
<P>When the death of Kerim Khan was announced in Shirauz, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Franklin,</HI> much confu&s;ion aro&s;e. Two and twenty of the principal officers of high rank and fa|mily, with the elde&s;t &s;on of Kerim, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
<PB N="363" REF="376">
the citadel, determining to &s;upport that &s;on, as their &s;o|vereign again&s;t all other pretenders. But Zikea Khan a relation of Kerim's by the mother's &s;ide, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of immen&s;e wealth, bribed great part of the army, &s;tormed the citadel, and, finding he could not take it by force, had recour&s;e to treachery. To each of the principal officers in the citadel, he &s;ent a written paper, by which he &s;wore upon the Koran, that if they would come out and &s;ub|mit to him, they &s;hould have his protection, and their effects &s;hould be &s;ecured to them. As they could not hold the place again&s;t him, they relied on his promi&s;es, and agreed to &s;urrender. In the mean time, Zikea gave private orders to &s;eize them all, had them brought before him, &s;eparately, as they came out from the citadel; and the&s;e deluded men, were all ma&s;&s;acred in his pre&s;ence. He was &s;eated the whole time, fea&s;ting his eyes on the cruel &s;pectacle. The manner of their execution was very &s;ingular, and characteri&s;tic of the &s;anguinary di&s;po|&s;ition of the tyrant. Five or &s;ix Pehlwaums or wre&s;tlers, being &s;tripped naked to the wai&s;t, were armed with &s;cy|mitars; each of them &s;ucce&s;&s;ively &s;ingled out a victim, and cut him to pieces: their bodies were thrown into the &s;quare before the palace. Kerim's &s;on's life was &s;pared, but made a &s;tate-pri&s;oner, and the adherents of the&s;e of|ficers were taken into Zikea's pay. Another claimant to the crown &s;tarting up, Zikea marched again&s;t him, and on his arrival at Yezdekha&s;t, about &s;ix days journey north of Shirauz, he &s;ent word to the inhabitants, that he expected they would deliver up to him the &s;um of
<PB N="364" REF="377">
3,000 Tomans, (about 5000<HI>l.</HI> Engli&s;h) which had been carried from Shirauz at the time of Kerim Khan's death. This money had been previou&s;ly &s;ent to the governor of I&s;pahan, appointed by the Shah who re&s;ides at I&s;pahan, and who has po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the northern parts of Per&s;ia, Jaafar only po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the &s;outhern provinces. The in|habitants &s;ending word back they had not the money, and knew not what was become of it, he ordered eighteen of the principal people of the place to be brought before him. When they appeared, he again demanded what was become of the money? they &s;till pleaded ignorance, but in vain; for the cruel tyrant or|dered them to be thrown down the precipice which hangs over the &s;o tre&s;s of Yezdekha&s;t. The &s;entence was im|mediately executed, and they were all cru&s;hed to atoms. Still un&s;atiated with blood, and irritated by di&s;appoint|ment, this mon&s;ter gave orders for a Seiud to be brought before him. This was a man univer&s;ally re&s;pected for his piety and exemplary life, and whom the people &s;up|po&s;ed to be a de&s;cendant of their prophet Mahomet. On his arrival in Zikea's pre&s;ence, he a&s;ked him, as he had done before of the 18 principal inhabitants, where the 3,000 Tomans were concealed, and charged him him with having embezzled a part of them. In vain did the Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ud plead his ignorance and innocence. Zikea with a &s;avage fury, fir&s;t ordered him to be ripped up and thrown over the precipice, which was in&s;tantly ex|ecuted, and then commanded the wife and daughter of the unhappy man to be given up to the brutal lu&s;t of the
<PB N="365" REF="378">
&s;oldiery; but they, fortunately, were more merciful than their ma&s;ter; and being &s;truck with indignation at this cruel in&s;ult, on a religious man, who from his de&s;cent was deemed a &s;acred character, even among&s;t the licen|tious, were fired with impatience to get rid of &s;uch a &s;acrilegious mon&s;ter. After the above horrid &s;cene, Zikea gave orders to have the fortre&s;s of Yezdekha&s;t razed to the ground, and it was immediately begun; but the mea&s;ure of the tyrant's iniquity was full, he did not live to &s;ee his order completed. Seventy of the <HI>Goolaums,</HI> or body-guard, having entered into a re&s;olu|tion to de&s;troy him, waited the approach of night, to put their de&s;ign into execution. Accordingly, about nine in the evening, they, in a body, drew near the ty|rant's tent, where they perceived him &s;itting with his pi&s;|tols and drawn &s;cymitar by his &s;ide; for he was never unarmed. The &s;ight of the tyrant &s;o daunted &s;ome of them, that, out of the 70, &s;even only had courage &s;ufficient to approach him. The&s;e &s;even, without the &s;malle&s;t he&s;itation, cut the ropes of his tent with their &s;cymitars, which falling in, and entangling him, the other men ru&s;hed in, and his body was cut into a thou|&s;and pieces, and &s;cattered over the encampment by the enraged &s;oldiery. From the death of this man, the country was again torn by civil wars, and was in this &s;tate November 1788.</P>
<P>Shirauz has many fine mo&s;ques, the chief of which I have de&s;cribed, and a &s;quare building, of a very large &s;ize,
<PB N="366" REF="379">
formerly a college of con&s;iderable note, where the arts and &s;ciences were taught, but it is now decaying very fa&s;t, and has only a few prie&s;ts and religious men re&s;iding in it. There are places here di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>Zo&ograve;r Kh&agrave;na,</HI> the hou&s;e of &s;trength, or exerci&s;e, to which the Per&s;ians re&s;ort for the &s;ake of exerci&s;ing them|&s;elves. The&s;e hou&s;es con&s;i&s;t of one room, with the floor &s;unk about two feet below the &s;urface of the earth, and the light and air are admitted to the apartment by means of &s;everal &s;mall apertures, perforated in the dome. In the centre is a large &s;quare terrace, or platform of earth, well beaten down, &s;mooth and even; and on each &s;ide are &s;mall alcoves, rai&s;ed about two feet above the platform, where the mu&s;icians and &s;pectators are &s;eated. When all the competitors are a&s;&s;embled, which is on every Friday morning, at day-break, they immediately &s;trip them&s;elves to the wai&s;t, on which each man puts on a pair of thick woollen drawers, and takes in his hands two wooden clubs, about a foot and a half in length, and cut in the &s;hape of a pear, the&s;e they re&s;t on each &s;houlder, and the mu&s;ic &s;triking up, they move them backward and forward, with great agility, &s;tamp|ing with their feet at the &s;ame time, and &s;training every nerve, till they produce a very profu&s;e per&s;piration. After continuing this exerci&s;e about half an hour, the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, who is always one of them, and is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the appellation of <HI>Pehlwa&ugrave;n,</HI> or wre&s;tler, makes a &s;ignal, on which they all leave off, quit their clubs, and, joining hands in a circle, begin to move
<PB N="367" REF="380" MS="y">
their feet very bri&s;kly, in time with the mu&s;ic, which is all the time playing a lively tune: having continued this for a con&s;iderable time, they commence wre&s;tling; but, before this trial of &s;kill begins, the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e addre&s;&s;es the company in a &s;et &s;peech, in which he tells the candidates, that, as they are all met in good fellow&s;hip, &s;o ought they to depart; and that, in the conte&s;t they are about entering into, they &s;hould have no malice, or ill-will in their hearts, it being only an honourable emula|tion, and trial of &s;trength, in which they are going to exert them&s;elves, and not a contentious brawl; he there|fore cautions them to proceed in good humour, and concord. This &s;peech is loudly applauded, and the wre&s;tling begins. The ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e is always the challenger, and, being accu&s;tomed to the exerci&s;e, is generally the conqueror, by throwing each of the com|pany two or three times &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. The &s;pectators each pay a <HI>Shahee,</HI> equal to three-pence Engli&s;h, for which they are refre&s;hed with a calean, that is, a pipe of tobacco, and coffee. This mode of exerci&s;e mu&s;t con|tribute to health, and add &s;trength and manly appearance to the frame, and bears &s;ome re&s;emblance to the gym|na&s;tic exerci&s;es of the ancients.</P>
