<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON LIVE STOCK.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been matter of &s;urpri&s;e to me, that none of our countrymen have hitherto attempted to write a Treati&s;e expre&s;sly upon what farmers call <HI>Stock;</HI> by which I mean tho&s;e dome&s;tic animals with which our fields, our yards, and &s;tables, are, or ought to be &s;tored, &s;uch as hor&s;es, cattle, &s;heep, and &s;wine; the know|ledge of which, I apprehend, is at this period of improvement, as nece&s;|&s;ary for the farmer, as the well cul|tivating of a field for wheat, barley, turnips, or any other crop. For, ac|cording
<PB N="2" REF="7">to the pre&s;ent improved &s;y&s;|tem of farming, there is &s;uch a con|nection between the cultivation of the ground, and the breeding, rearing, and fattening of cattle, &s;heep, and other dome&s;tic animals, that a man will make but an indifferent figure in rural affairs, if he does not under&s;tand the latter as well as the former.&mdash;Our &s;helves are loaded with volumes that have been written on the &s;ubject of rearing crops, while but little has been &s;aid upon tho&s;e very u&s;eful animals referred to above. Con&s;cious of my own inability to undertake &s;o import|ant, tho' nece&s;&s;ary a ta&s;k, I repeatedly &s;olicited &s;ome of my acquaintance, who I believed to be well able to per|form it; and in particular one whom it is not nece&s;&s;ary here to name, for who&s;e abilities I have the highe&s;t re|&s;pect, who&s;e whole life has been em|ployed in breeding and improving
<PB N="3" REF="8">&s;tock, and who has carried it to very great perfection, from the experience and clo&s;e application of his whole life, &s;pent in the pur&s;uit of breeding u&s;e|ful &s;tock: But being unable to prevail upon him to write on this &s;ubject, I &s;hall venture to offer my own thoughts in the be&s;t manner I am able, from the hopes that this may induce &s;ome abler per&s;on to write upon this hither|to almo&s;t unbeaten track, for the good of mankind, and particularly for the benefit of my brother breeders.</P>
<P>IT may be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that tho' a late writer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Clark's Theory of Hu&s;bandry.</NOTE> has given us very learned de&s;criptions of the bull, hor&s;e, and ram, &amp;c. yet it does not appear he has treated of the&s;e matters near &s;o fully as the nature and import|ance of the &s;ubject requires. His lan|guage is not altogether &s;o plain, nor
<PB N="4" REF="9">adapted to the education of many of our farmers, as it ought to be: He is far too conci&s;e in regard to the differ|ent breeds of &s;heep belonging to this i&s;land, and has &s;aid nothing at all re|lative to the various breeds of cattle; and be&s;ides, tho' his de&s;criptions have much merit, yet I &s;hall venture to dif|fer from him in &s;ome particulars con|cerning the &s;hape of cattle and &s;heep, which will be pointed out in their proper places.&mdash;As I do not profe&s;s any great &s;hare of knowledge in re|gard to hor&s;es, I &s;hall con&s;equently &s;ay le&s;s concerning them than the other kinds of &s;tock, with which I have been more conver&s;ant, and to which I have paid more attention, particularly &s;heep. However, as hor&s;es are univer&s;ally allowed to be among&s;t the mo&s;t u&s;eful animals of the crea|tion, we &s;hall give them the fir&s;t place in our narration.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="10">IN regard to the hor&s;e, then, I pre|&s;ume his head &s;hould be as &s;mall as the proportion of the animal will ad|mit; his no&s;trils expanded, and muzzle fine; his eyes chearful and prominent; his ears &s;mall, upright, and placed near together; his neck ri&s;ing out of his back and &s;houlders with an ea&s;y tapering curve, mu&s;t join gracefully to the head; his &s;houlders being well thrown back, mu&s;t al&s;o go into his neck (at what is called the points) unperceived, which perhaps facilitates the going much more than the narrow &s;houlder, which mo&s;t people are ad|mirers of; for, whoever has ob&s;erved a greyhound or a hare, will perceive how very wide they are made at the upper part of the &s;houlders, and there are few animals that move with &s;o much ea&s;e and &s;wiftne&s;s as they do: The arm, or fore thigh, &s;hould be mu&s;|cular, and tapering from the &s;houlder,
<PB N="6" REF="11">meet with a fine &s;traight &s;inewy boney leg; the hoof circular, and wide at the heel; his che&s;t deep, and full at the girth; his loin or fillets broad and &s;traight, and ribs round; his hips or hooks, by no means wide, but quar|ters long, and tail &s;et high on; his thighs &s;trong and mu&s;cular, his legs clean, and fine-boned; the leg-bones not round, but what is called lathy.</P>
<P>It is generally thought that we on|ly have two original breeds of hor&s;es in this i&s;land, <HI>viz.</HI> the race or blood kind, and the black cart-breed: the re&s;t have been &s;uppo&s;ed to be only varia|tions from the&s;e two, introduced by re|peated cro&s;&s;ings; and yet we are &s;truck with &s;urpri&s;e, when we con&s;ider the difference between the gigantic dray-hor&s;e, 18 hands high, &s;talking upon the London pavements, and the &s;mall Highland, or Shetland poney, tripping over the mo&s;&s;es with a heavy load,
<PB N="7" REF="12">tho' not more than nine hands, or 36 inches high when at his full growth. I &s;hall decline &s;aying any-thing of the blood-hor&s;es; 1&s;t, becau&s;e I know very little concerning them; and, 2dly, be|cau&s;e I think farmers ought to have little or nothing to do with them, ex|cept now and then putting a good mare to a &s;trong well-proportioned blood-hor&s;e, by way of mixing a little blood among&s;t our chapmen or riding hor&s;es. Perhaps for &s;ome particular u&s;es, even a plough-hor&s;e may not be the wor&s;e for having a little blood in him, as it is termed; and every man, I apprehend, who has rode five hun|dred miles upon hor&s;eback, will admit, that a hor&s;e which has a little blood in him, will u&s;ually perform a plea&s;anter day's work, than one that has little or none of the racing breed in him: For, notwith&s;tanding objections have been made by late writers to the cro&s;&s;ing of
<PB N="8" REF="13">breeds of animals, I cannot help being of a different opinion; becau&s;e, from many years experience, I have much rea&s;on to believe, that great improve|ments have been, and may be made by cro&s;&s;ing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">What I mean by cro&s;&s;ing, is to put the be&s;t male of the &s;ame &s;pecies, or of different varieties of the &s;ame kind, to the be&s;t females; &s;o as by repeated cro&s;&s;es in this way, you have improved your breed as far as you can. This I think is clearly right, as long as better males can be met with among your neighbours&mdash;among&s;t the improved breeds in any part of this i&s;land; or why not from tho&s;e in any part of the world, provided the expence does not exceed the propo&s;ed advantage? for I have no no|tion of &s;etting bounds to improvements of any de|&s;cription. It quickens that laudible de&s;ire of ex|celling our rivals, which leads us to di&s;coveries of the highe&s;t importance,&mdash;di&s;coveries which in every period have &s;o eminently marked the genius and enterpri&s;ing &s;pirit of this ble&s;&s;ed i&s;land. Then, when you can no longer, at home or abroad, meet with better males than your own, breed from the&s;e, whether hor&s;es, neat cattle, &s;heep, &amp;c. for the &s;ame rule that holds good in one kind, will in another. But upon no account attempt to breed or cro&s;s from wor&s;e than your own, for that would be act|ing in contradiction to common &s;en&s;e, experience, and that well-e&s;tabli&s;hed rule, viz. <Q>that be&s;t only can beget be&s;t.</Q> Allow me to add, that from the be&s;t males and females only, the be&s;t breeds can be obtained.</NOTE>, not only among&s;t the diffe|rent kinds of hor&s;es, but neat cattle (horned or black cattle as they have been differently called) and &s;heep; and I apprehend it is from the&s;e cro&s;&s;es,
<PB N="9" REF="14">properly made, that this i&s;land has been long famous for &s;uch a noted and excellent breed of &s;addle-hor&s;es, in &s;o much that great numbers are al|mo&s;t every year bought up for France, and other parts of the Continent. If cro&s;&s;ing was not of u&s;e, even among&s;t the blood-race, why &s;hould Gentle|men of the Turf be at the trouble, and very great expence, in procuring &s;tallions from Arabia, and different parts of Turkey, &amp;c. Nay, the well-atte&s;ted pedigrees of mo&s;t of our race|hor&s;es,
<PB N="10" REF="15">I perceive, generally terminate with a Burton Barb, or Place's White Turk, &amp;c. which is a proof that the&s;e cro&s;&s;es have been attended with &s;uc|ce&s;s.</P>
<P>The breed of &s;addle-hor&s;es is con|fined in a great mea&s;ure to York&s;hire, Durham, and Northumberland: the Ea&s;t Riding of York&s;hire has been long eminent in that line. The annual fairs held at Northallerton, Howden, and York, exhibit the large&s;t &s;hows of the&s;e u&s;eful creatures: perhaps it may be owing to this that York&s;hiremen are all called Jockeys, or knowing hands in regard to hor&s;es; and indeed you will &s;carce meet with a farmer in that county, e&s;pecially in the low part of it, who is not well &s;killed in hor&s;es. Since bay and other light|going hor&s;es, have been preferred to the black breed for carriages, the York&s;hire breeders have gone &s;o much
<PB N="11" REF="16">upon the&s;e, that I am informed the old breed of riding or &s;addle-hor&s;es are much wore out. This is owing, perhaps, not only to the greater de|mand for the latter, but al&s;o to the coach-hor&s;es being a &s;tronger and larger breed; as al&s;o, if they happen, from blemi&s;hes, not to an&s;wer for the harne&s;s, they &s;uit for the plough or cart; while the &s;addle-hor&s;e, from the &s;ame misfortunes, is rendered in a great mea&s;ure u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>The midland counties, particular|ly Leice&s;ter&s;hire, Warwick&s;hire, Staf|ford&s;hire, and Derby&s;hire, breed al|mo&s;t altogether of the black kind. It is the univer&s;al cu&s;tom in tho&s;e coun|ties, for the farmers to u&s;e mares only for labour: the&s;e are all put to the hor&s;e, the male produce of which &s;upply the Army, London, and mo&s;t of the &s;outh and we&s;tern counties with hor&s;es for their farming-teams.
<PB N="12" REF="17">The large&s;t go to the capital, for dray|hor&s;es; the next &s;upply the farmers in the &s;outhern counties, for their wag|gons, ploughs, &amp;c. and the re&s;t mount our cavalry, or are trained to the car|riages, while a few of the choice&s;t are very properly pre&s;erved for &s;tallions.</P>
<P>The vanity of many of the farm|ers in the South, in regard to their teams, is mo&s;t extraordinary. I have, in Berk&s;hire, and that neighbourhood, &s;everal times met a narrow-wheel'd waggon, with &s;ix &s;tone-hor&s;es, one be|fore another; the fir&s;t hor&s;e, be&s;ides having on a huge bridle, covered with fringe and ta&s;&s;els enough to half-load a common York&s;hire cart-hor&s;e, has &s;ix bells hung to it, the next five, and &s;o on to the la&s;t, which has only one; and it is really divert|ing to &s;ee with what a conceited air the driver &s;truts and brandi&s;hes his long whip.&mdash;A &s;trange contra&s;t this
<PB N="13" REF="18">with the poor Highlander carting home his peats for winter-fuel, when frequently both hor&s;e and cart are not of the &s;ame value as the harne&s;s u&s;ed to a Berk&s;hire waggon-hor&s;e. The Reader will be the le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed, when I a&s;&s;ure him, that I have in Scot|land many times &s;een a hor&s;e and cart conveying peats or turfs, when the whole apparatus neither contained iron, leather, or hemp; the collar or bracham was made of &s;traw, the back|band of platted ru&s;hes, and the wheels of wood only, without bu&s;h of metal, or binding of iron.</P>
<P>One of the Earls of Huntington re|turning from an emba&s;&s;y to the States-General, brought home with him a &s;et of coach-hor&s;es of the black breed from the Continent. Mo&s;t of the&s;e being &s;tallions, he with &s;ome diffi|culty prevailed upon his tenants by the Trent-Side, to put their mares to
<PB N="14" REF="19">them; which cro&s;s an&s;wered &s;o well, that the breed in that neighbourhood has been in the greate&s;t repute ever &s;ince. This many years afterwards in|duced Mr Bakewell, and another Lei|ce&s;ter&s;hire breeder, to cro&s;s the Ger|man Ocean in &s;earch of hor&s;es and mares, to improve the Engli&s;h breed; and after much labour and expence, they returned with half-a-dozen Dutch or Flanders mares. And I have often heard Mr Bakewell &s;ay, that he never met with a man but he could have prevailed upon him to part with his &s;tock for money, except in Holland, where he met with a Dutch boor, who would not &s;ell one of his mares for any price which Mr Bakewell thought worth his while to give; and any-body who knows the above great breeder, will be &s;en&s;ible that he would not limit for price, who gave above &s;eventy guineas, when begin|ning
<PB N="15" REF="20">bu&s;ine&s;s, for a cart-mare to breed from. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e Dutch mares were of u&s;e in improving the Leice&s;ter&s;hire black breed, yet it per|haps &s;carce an&s;wered the end propo&s;ed; becau&s;e, by this time, the heavy un|wieldy black hor&s;es were growing in|to di&s;repute; the Nobility and Gentry were begun to run bay-hor&s;es in their carriages; light hor&s;es were more u&s;ed in the Army than heretofore; but, above all, the &s;pirited indu&s;try and activity in farming, required hor&s;es of more mettle than tho&s;e already mentioned; but they yet are, and probably will ever be, valuable for drays and waggons.&mdash;But, how would the Norfolk farmers &s;ow two, three, or four hundred acres of turnips upon one farm, in proper time, in the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on,&mdash; and plow two, or near three acres <HI>per</HI> day with one pair of hor&s;es, if they had them not from a hardier
<PB N="16" REF="21">and nimbler breed than tho&s;e allud|ed to? It is long &s;ince I was told by the Cleveland farmers, that the black hor&s;es could not &s;tand to their work, and could not go at the rate of their own country hor&s;es; that whenever they were put pa&s;t their pace, they grea&s;ed, and frequently went blind: Yet it is in this indu&s;trious part of York&s;hire, and in Norfolk, Suffolk, &amp;c. that we mu&s;t look for farming-hor&s;es able to go through fatigue and hard&s;hip, able to walk at a pace that the others cannot, and able to work &s;ix days in every week in the year. It is a well-known fact, that the&s;e will, upon an average, wear as long again as the rough-legged gummy black breed.</P>
<P>But let us not forget to do ju&s;tice to a Northern di&s;trict in this i&s;land, that produces as good a farming-hor&s;e as any of the&s;e alluded to&mdash;I mean
<PB N="17" REF="22">the We&s;t of Scotland: They are in general greys or browns; but from whence they had the breed, I know not: and tho' I mu&s;t allow that they are plain-made in general, about the head, &s;ides, and hind-legs, yet it is a fact founded upon experience, that we have not a hardier race in the i&s;land.</P>
<P>The be&s;t and hardie&s;t hor&s;es for the draught I ever remember &s;eeing, pro|ceeded from a cro&s;s between the coun|try mares by the Tee's &s;ide, and a &s;tal|lion brought from Hol&s;tein: they are not tall hor&s;es, ri&s;ing only from about fourteen hands three inches, to fif|teen hands three inches, exceedingly &s;trong made, with &s;hort clean-boned legs, very firm carca&s;es, and equal to any fatigue.</P>
<P>The Welch have a very hardy breed of hor&s;es, but rather &s;mall for the team; but where they are good goers, few or none can equal them for the
<PB N="18" REF="23">road; none &s;tand our turnpikes like them: and I well remember one that I rode for many years, and to the la&s;t he would have gone upon a pavement by choice, in preference to &s;ofter road.</P>
<P>The Scotch hor&s;es, like the Welch, are exceedingly hardy, but too &s;mall for the draught, except the Clyde&s;dale hor&s;es, &amp;c. taken notice of before. Tho&s;e properly called galloways, are now rare to be met with, from an inexcu&s;able inattention to the breed, which is nearly lo&s;t. The breed ori|ginated, as we may &s;uppo&s;e, from the name Galloway, and it is generally &s;aid was owing to cro&s;&s;ing with the Spani&s;h hor&s;es, when a part of the invincible armada was &s;hipwrecked upon tho&s;e rocky coa&s;ts. There is much probability in the account; but whether true or not, is not &s;o material as the lo&s;s of &s;o valuable a breed of little hor&s;es is to be lamented.</P>

<HEAD>De&s;cription of the Bull.</HEAD>
<P>THE head of the BULL &s;hould be rather long; his muzzle fine, and no|&s;trils wide; his eyes lively and pro|minent; his ears long and thin; his horns white; his neck &s;trong and ri&s;|ing rather from the &s;houlders, but &s;mall and fine where it joins the head; his &s;houlders broad at the top, yet to &s;it full to his crops and che&s;t backwards, and to his neck vein-putt or mou&s;e-piece forwards; his bo&s;om open, brea&s;t deep, broad, and well &s;een before his legs; his arms or fore|thighs full, and tapering to his knee; his legs &s;traight, clean, and very fine boned, with good large hoofs; his crops and che&s;t &s;o full as to leave no hollow behind the &s;houlders, and &s;o &s;trong in the plates as to keep his
<PB N="20" REF="25">belly from &s;inking below the level of his brea&s;t; his back or loin broad, &s;traight, and flat; ribs well up (as the graziers term it), viz. one ri&s;ing above another, in &s;uch a manner as the la&s;t rib &s;hould be rather the highe&s;t, which &s;hould leave only a &s;mall &s;pace to the hips or hooks; the&s;e &s;hould be wide placed, round, and full in &s;hape; the quarters long, tail high, rumps clo&s;e; and the quarters, in&s;tead of be|ing &s;quare, as recommended by &s;ome writers on hu&s;bandry, &s;hould taper gradually from the hips backward; the turls or pottbones quite &s;unk, and in every re&s;pect different from the round, lyery, or Dutch form, &s;o unde|&s;ervedly e&s;teemed formerly. The form here de&s;cribed will, when fed, be co|vered with fat to the hock or hough; the bones of his hind-legs &s;ame as tho&s;e before, <HI>viz.</HI> clean, &s;mall, and &s;traight; tail broad, and well-haired.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="26">THOUGH I &s;aid that probably we only had two original breeds of hor&s;es in this i&s;land, yet I apprehend we have &s;everal different breeds of cattle, <HI>viz.</HI> the long-horned, or Lanca&s;hire kind; the &s;hort-horned, or Dutch kind; the polled, humbled, or Gal|loway breed; the Kiloes, or Scotch cattle; the Alderney, or French breed; and the wild breed which are &s;till pre&s;erved by &s;ome of our Nobility in their parks, and perhaps &s;ome others I may not be acquainted with.</P>
<P>The Welch breed of cattle I take to be much the &s;ame as the Scotch; and as to the Hereford&s;hire brown cattle, they are, I am pretty clear, neither more nor le&s;s than a mixture between the Welch and a ba&s;tard race of long-horns, that are every-where to be met with in Che&s;hire, Shrop&s;hire, &amp;c.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I am told, that be&s;ides the &s;pecies I have trent|ed of, there are two more very u&s;eful breeds in this i&s;land, <HI>viz.</HI> One in Su&s;&s;ex, valuable both for the draught and feeding quality; the other in De|von&s;hire, al&s;o very good feeders:&mdash;But as the&s;e are two of the few countries which I have not yet had it in my power to vi&s;it, I think it would be wrong in me to &s;ay any-thing re&s;pecting their breeds of cattle.</NOTE></P>

<P>FIRST, then, in regard to the Long-horned, or Lanca&s;hire kind.&mdash;This kind is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the others by the length of their horns, thick|ne&s;s of their hides, long thick hair all over them, and having mo&s;tly a white &s;treak along their back, and a white &s;treak on the middle of the hock or

However, Lanca|&s;hire at pre&s;ent, and for a long time pa&s;t, has as much right to be called the mother-country for long-horned cattle, as Lincoln&s;hire has to the large long-wool'd &s;heep; for, though all or mo&s;t of our chee&s;e-dairies in Che&s;hire, Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, &amp;c. employ a kind of long-horned cows, and indeed the greate&s;t part of the midland counties, yet they are only a &s;habby mixed breed, much inferior in &s;ize and fi|gure to the Lanca&s;hire breed, from whence it is very probable they all originated. Leice&s;ter&s;hire, Warwick|&s;hire, &amp;c. have got a better and more profitable &s;ort of long-horns than Lan|ca&s;hire at pre&s;ent, by buying up their
<PB N="25" REF="32">be&s;t bulls and heifers for many years pa&s;t, before the people of Lanca&s;hire were well aware of it. Indeed the &s;ormer paid more attention to that kind, which were of a true mould or form, con&s;equently quicker feeders; while the latter contented them&s;elves with the old-fa&s;hioned, large, big-boned kind, which are not only &s;lower &s;eeders, but, when fed, are not &s;uch good eating beef. In &s;hort, the little farmers in Lanca&s;hire, tempted with the high prices given them for their be&s;t &s;tock, had lo&s;t their valuable breed before they were quite &s;en&s;ible of it.</P>
<P>As I may often have occa&s;ion, in this Treati&s;e, to mention Mr Bake|well, from the &s;uperior manner in which he has di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the breeding of cattle and &s;heep, I would beg leave, by a &s;hort digre&s;&s;ion, to point out &s;ome of the principal
<PB N="26" REF="33">advantages this Gentleman's breed of ftock has over tho&s;e that were in great|e&s;t repute before his day: For he ab&s;olutely &s;truck out new lights, and not only adopted a breed of cattle and &s;heep, different from, and &s;upe|rior in many e&s;&s;ential re&s;pects to mo&s;t others, but e&s;tabli&s;hed them in &s;uch a manner as to gain ground in every corner of Great Britain and Ireland, in con&s;equence of their &s;uperior merit.</P>
<P>The kind of cattle that were mo&s;t e&s;teemed before Mr Bakewell's day, were the large, long-bodied, big-boned, coar&s;e, gummy, flat-&s;ided kind, and often lyery or black-fle&s;hed. On the contrary, this di&s;cerning breeder in|troduced a &s;mall, clean-boned, round, &s;hort-carca&s;ed, kindly-looking cattle, and inclined to be fat; and it is a fact, that the&s;e will both eat le&s;s food in proportion, and make them&s;elves &s;ooner fat, than the others: they will
<PB N="27" REF="34">in truth pay more for their meat in a given time, than any other &s;ort we know of in the grazing way. His &s;heep are &s;till more excellent than his cattle; but as we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;peak of the&s;e afterwards, I will on|ly add, that perhaps this Gentleman was the principal cau&s;e of the Lanca|&s;hire people lo&s;ing their be&s;t breed; but then he al&s;o was the means of e&s;tabli&s;hing a much more advanta|geous one in Leice&s;ter&s;hire.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal more eminent breeders in that &s;pirited part of the i&s;land, where they have carried the breeding of u&s;eful &s;tock to a pitch unknown in former days, and what other parts of the i&s;land have &s;till only a very faint idea of. Mr Bake|well well de&s;erves the thanks of his country, for promoting the breeds of u&s;eful dome&s;tic animals:&mdash;This Gen|tleman, by his laudible example, has
<PB N="28" REF="35">not only improved the breeding of good &s;tock near home, but has &s;pread it every-where within tho&s;e i&s;lands. The Iri&s;h breeders have given him very large prices for his bulls: Mr Bakewell keeps great numbers, and has let &s;everal for one &s;ea&s;on, as high as from twenty to &s;ixty guineas each, into different parts of Britain.</P>
<P>THE &s;hort-horned breed of cattle, is the next to be de&s;cribed; and it is pretty evident that our forefathers have imported the&s;e from the Conti|nent:&mdash;Fir&s;t, becau&s;e they are &s;till in many places called the Dutch breed:&mdash;2dly, becau&s;e we find the&s;e cattle no-where in this i&s;land, except along the ea&s;t coa&s;t, facing tho&s;e parts of the Continent where the &s;ame kind of cattle are &s;till bred; and reaching from Lincoln&s;hire &s;outhwards, to the borders of Scotland northwards. The
<PB N="29" REF="36">long-horns and the&s;e have met upon the mountains which divide York|&s;hire from Lanca&s;hire, &amp;c.: and, by cro&s;&s;ing, they have produced a mixed breed called half-longhorns; a very heavy, &s;trong, and not very unu&s;eful kind of cattle: but we do not find that the one kind have &s;pread further we&s;t, nor the others ea&s;t.&mdash;But, 3dly, I re|member a Gentleman of the county of Durham, (a Mr Michael Dobi&s;on), who went in the early part of his life into Holland, in order to buy bulls; and tho&s;e he brought over, I have been told, did much &s;ervice in im|proving the breed: and this Mr Dobi|&s;on, and neighbours even in my day, were noted for having the be&s;t breeds of &s;hort-horned cattle, and &s;old their bulls and heifers for very great prices. But afterwards, &s;ome other people of le&s;s knowledge going over, brought home &s;ome bulls that in all probabi|lity
<PB N="30" REF="37">introduced into that coa&s;t the di&s;|agreeable kind of cattle, well known to the breeders upon the river Tees, and called lyery, or doubled-lyered, that is, black-fle&s;hed; for, one of the&s;e creatures, notwith&s;tanding it will feed to a va&s;t weight, and though you feed it ever &s;o long, yet will not have one pound of fat about it, neither within nor without<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I once &s;aw one of this &s;ort killed, which, after feeding all &s;ummer, had not a pound of fat, in&s;ide nor out; but I confe&s;s it was one of the compleate&s;t of the kind I ever &s;aw: Its two ends, <HI>viz.</HI> &s;houlders and buttocks, were heavy, round, and coar&s;e, with|out any hip-bones at all &s;tanding up, and the body quite &s;mall; in &s;hort, it was more like an ill-made black hor&s;e, than an ox or cow.</NOTE>; and the fle&s;h (for it does not de&s;erve to be called beef) is as black and coar&s;e-grained, as we generally &s;uppo&s;e hor&s;e-fle&s;h to be. However, by the pains and attention of the breeders, this u&s;ele&s;s di&s;agreeable breed is now pretty well out of the
<PB N="31" REF="38">country. No man will buy one of this kind, if he knows any-thing of the matter; and if he &s;hould be once taken in, he will remember it well for the future; for people conver&s;ant with cattle very readily find them out, from their round form all over, particularly their buttocks, which are turned like a black coach-hor&s;e, and the &s;mallne&s;s of the tail: But they are be&s;t known to the graziers and deal|ers in cattle, by the feel or touch of the fingers; and indeed it is this nice touch or feel of the hand, that in a great mea&s;ure con&s;titutes the judge of cattle&mdash;But more of this afterwards.</P>
<P>The York&s;hire firkin-butter &s;o fa|mous in the London markets, and thin &s;kimmed-milk chee&s;e, are all made from the cows of this breed; for they give the mo&s;t milk of any kind of cows we know of, tho' it is generally &s;aid not to be &s;o good in
<PB N="32" REF="39">quality as the long-horned cows milk; and tho' the chee&s;es made from long-horned cows, fetch the highe&s;t price at market, yet the firkin-butter made from the &s;hort-horns has the be&s;t cha|racter.</P>
<P>Our heavie&s;t and large&s;t oxen, when properly fed, victual the Ea&s;t-India &s;hips: as they produce the thicke&s;t beef, con&s;equently keeps in the juices, and &s;uits be&s;t for &s;uch long voyages. Our Royal Navy &s;hould al&s;o be vic|tualled from the&s;e; but, by the jobs made by contractors, and the abu&s;es lately crept in, our hone&s;t tars, I am afraid, are often fed with fle&s;h rather than that valuable beef. However, the coal-&s;hips from Newca&s;tle, Shields, Sunderland, &amp;c. are totally &s;upplied from the beef of the&s;e valuable ani|mals. The&s;e oxen in common feed to from 60 to 100 &s;tone weight, 14 lb. to the &s;tone; and they have &s;everal
<PB N="33" REF="40">times been fed to 120, 130, and &s;ome particular ones to 140 &s;tone the four quarters only.&mdash;Sir Thomas Hagger|&s;tone of Hagger&s;tone in Northumber|land, perhaps bred and fed the two large&s;t and heavie&s;t oxen of this or any other breed then &s;hewn in this kingdom: The be&s;t judges allowed them to weigh 140 &s;tone each;&mdash;how|ever, their real weight was not known, as Sir Thomas, or his &s;teward, I am told, &s;old them to two butchers, who attempted to drive them to Edinburgh to &s;hew them alive for money by the head; but I under&s;tand, the one drop|ped down dead on the road, and the other in Edinburgh, or between that place and Gla&s;gow, from their exce&s;|&s;ive fat, and inability to travel,&mdash;or rather from the want of judgment or neglect in the drivers. Since Sir Tho|mas Hagger&s;tone's oxen were killed, Mr Hill of Blackwell near Darlington
<PB N="34" REF="41">in the county of Durham, in the year 1779, had an ox killed, of his own breeding and feeding, who&s;e four quarters weighed 151 &s;tone and 10 lb. 14 lb. to the &s;tone; and which I be|lieve exceeded any ox ever fed in this i&s;land, for either fat, weight, or beauty.</P>
<P>This breed of cattle, like mo&s;t others, is better and wor&s;e in different di|&s;tricts; not &s;o much owing, I appre|hend, to the goodne&s;s or badne&s;s of the ground, as to the judgment and attention of the breeders. &mdash; In Lin|coln&s;hire<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In a journey through Lincoln&s;hire la&s;t Au|tumn 1784, I was happy to find that many of tho&s;e &s;en&s;ible breeders had improved their breed of &s;hort-horned cattle very much (&s;ince my vi&s;iting that fine county ten years before) from good bulls and heifers brought from the county of Durham and York&s;hire, on both &s;ides of the river Tees, where the be&s;t are confe&s;&s;edly bred; e&s;pecially Mr Fi&s;her of Kirkby near Sleaford, who has remark|able fine cattle indeed, &s;hewed me on ox entirely white, which I thought the hand&s;ome&s;t and heavie&s;t I ever had &s;een, Mr Hill's excepted.</NOTE>,
<PB N="35" REF="42">(which is the farthe&s;t &s;outh that we meet with any quantity of this kind of cattle), they are in general more &s;ubject to lyer or black fle&s;h, than tho&s;e bred farther north: And in that rich flat part of York&s;hire called Holderne&s;s, they are much the &s;ame as &s;outh of the Humber of which we have been &s;peaking. It is probable they had &s;tuck more to the lyery, black-beefed Dutch breed, than their more northern neighbours, at that unfortunate period when the&s;e were imported from the Continent, or perhaps the latter had &s;een their error &s;ooner. But, from whatever cau&s;e this happened, it is a fact, that as &s;oon as we cro&s;s the York&s;hire Wolds northward, we find this breed alter for the better:&mdash;they become finer in the bone, in the carca&s;e, and in a great mea&s;ure free from that di&s;agree|able lyery &s;ort, which has brought
<PB N="36" REF="43">&s;uch an odium upon this perhaps mo&s;t valuable breed. When you reach that fine country on both &s;ides of the river Tees, you are then in the center of this breed of cattle&mdash;a country that has been long eminent for good &s;tock of all kinds&mdash;the country where the Dobbi&s;ons fir&s;t rai&s;ed a &s;pirit of emu|lation among&s;t the breeders, which is &s;till kept up by Mr Hill, Mr Charges, Mr Collings, Mr Maynard, &amp;c. The Darlington and Yarm annual fairs &s;till continue to &s;end out large droves of fine oxen, &s;teers, and queys.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry to ob&s;erve, that there are much fewer &s;teers kept now, than u&s;ed to be formerly. Two rea&s;ons may be a&s;&s;igned for this:&mdash;<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Lands are now rented at &s;o high a pitch, that farmers cannot afford to keep &s;teers to the age of oxen, without working them:&mdash;which brings me to my <HI>&s;econd</HI> rea&s;on, <HI>viz.</HI> That fewer oxen are u&s;ed in the draught now than formerly.
<PB N="37" REF="44">And a remedy for this complain per|haps may not be &s;o readily pointed out; becau&s;e, tho' a few people are convinced of the utility of drawing oxen in many ca&s;es, yet the generality of farmers will be very unwilling to be per&s;uaded to this, becau&s;e oxen are &s;lower in their motion than hor|&s;es, without adverting to the advan|tages attending the oxen in the feed|ing, &s;hoeing, harne&s;s, &amp;c.; but above all, the conclu&s;ion (between an ox fatted for the &s;hambles, after working three or four years, or indeed a lean ox &s;old to feed, and a hor&s;e &s;old to the dog-kennel) is &s;o exceedingly &s;triking, that I pre&s;ume mo&s;t people, when they reflect upon this very important matter, will agree to the drawing of oxen in every kind of work wherein they &s;uit. I u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion <HI>&s;uit,</HI> becau&s;e I would not be under&s;tood to think, as &s;ome people do, that oxen
<PB N="38" REF="45">will an&s;wer as well as hor&s;es in every kind of farming work; by no means: &mdash;But I apprehend, that oxen will do &s;everal kinds of home-work equally as well as hor&s;es. I advance this opi|nion from &s;everal years experience: and I do believe, that mo&s;t farmers might u&s;e part oxen along with their hor&s;es; but permit me to &s;ay, that I would in general recommend the oxen to draw by them&s;elves, and the hor&s;es by them&s;elves, becau&s;e the dif|ference of the &s;tep does not &s;uit at all.</P>
<P>Much more might be &s;aid upon this important &s;ubject, but I mu&s;t not now enter upon it; and will only add, that I heartily wi&s;h our Legi&s;lature would take this matter into con&s;idera|tion, and give premiums to encourage the rearing and drawing of oxen, and al&s;o to promote the breeding of the be&s;t kinds of &s;tock, as there is little doubt but it would have mo&s;t bene|ficial
<PB N="39" REF="46">effects.&mdash;It is true, that many of our agricultural &s;ocieties do give pre|miums for the above purpo&s;es; but the&s;e, though highly meritorious, are only partial, and confined to certain di&s;tricts, while the influence of the other would be general and exten&s;ive.</P>
<P>The north part of Durham, all Northumberland, and a few places in the &s;outh of Scotland, are almo&s;t the only places in this i&s;land where any number of oxen are now kept to age. Part of the&s;e are bought by the drov|ers, to go &s;outh, for grazing; the re&s;t are fed at home, to &s;upply the coal-trade. It is true they draw a few oxen in Hereford&s;hire, and &s;ome of the we&s;tern counties<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In Su&s;&s;ex, I believe, and perhaps in Devon|&s;hire, they draw oxen; but, as I &s;aid before, I am unacquainted with the&s;e two counties.</NOTE>; but tho&s;e of Lanca&s;hire, York&s;hire, &amp;c. are now mo&s;tly &s;old at three, four, or at mo&s;t five years old, &s;teers and oxen.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="47">THE <HI>Polled</HI> or <HI>Humbled Cattle</HI> come next under our con&s;ideration,&mdash;a kind well de&s;erving of notice. We find a few of the&s;e &s;traggling through differ|ent parts of England and Scotland: among&s;t the re&s;t, I remember Lord Darlington, not many years ago, had a very hand&s;ome breed of them, finely globed with red and white. But we mu&s;t look for the original of the&s;e in Galloway, a large di&s;trict in the &s;outh-we&s;t of Scotland: They are mo&s;tly bred upon the muirs or hilly country, and grazed upon the lands nearer the &s;ea, until part of them are ri&s;ing four, and others five years old, when the graziers and drovers take them up in prodigious numbers to the fairs in Norfolk and Suffolk<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The principal fairs are Woolpit in Suffolk, Hempton-green, Harle&s;ton, and Saint-faiths in Norfolk.</NOTE>,
<PB N="41" REF="48">previous to the turnip feeding &s;ea&s;ons: from whence they are again removed in the winter and &s;pring, in part to &s;upply the amazing con&s;umption of the capital, where they are readily &s;old, and at high prices; for, few or no cattle &s;ell &s;o high in Smithfield-market, being &s;uch nice cutters up, and laying the fat on upon the mo&s;t valuable parts; and this is a great ex|cellence in all feeding cattle. It is no uncommon thing in this refined mar|ket, to &s;ee one of the&s;e little bullocks out&s;ell a coar&s;e Lincoln&s;hire ox, tho' the latter be heavier by &s;everal &s;tones weight<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">I was told by a Lincoln&s;hire grazier, that a Lincoln&s;hire bullock, and a Scotch bullock, &s;ent from the &s;ame village to Smithfield, at the &s;ame time, were &s;old for exactly the &s;ame money, tho' the Scot was only half the other's weight.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The manner of rearing calves in Galloway, is &s;o &s;ingular, and &s;o dif|ferent from any-thing of the kind
<PB N="42" REF="49">that I had before &s;een or heard of, that I hope the mentioning of it here will not be objected to.&mdash;They are al|lowed to run with their dams all the day; but are prevented from &s;uck|ing, by means of a &s;mall piece of leather with &s;harp &s;pikes of iron fixed upon the out&s;ide, tied upon the upper part of the calf's no&s;e, which prickl|ing the cow every time the calf at|tempts to &s;uck, prevents her from letting it &s;uck; until the milk-maid comes, when &s;he takes off the muzzle from the little animal's no&s;e, and while &s;he &s;trips two of the teats, the calf takes care to empty the other two. As &s;oon as the maid has done, &s;he fixes on the in&s;trument again; but it is done in &s;uch a manner as not to hinder the calf from feeding upon the gra&s;s, though it is not al|lowed to ta&s;te the milk until the girl returns to her milking.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="50">I do not recollect whether they do it in Galloway, but I have ob&s;erved that it is the general practice through Scotland, to milk their cows in &s;um|mer three times in the day. In Gal|loway they &s;pay more queys than perhaps in all the i&s;land be&s;ides; and in this too their methods are different from any other part I am acquainted with, for they do not cut them until they are a year or near a year old; whereas in every other place I know, the quey calves are &s;payed from one to three months old: and indeed it is now generally admitted as the &s;afe&s;t practice, to ca&s;trate calves and lambs, male or female, while very young.</P>
<P>I find the breeders in Galloway, like mo&s;t other breeding countries in the&s;e kingdoms, complain of their old breed being lo&s;t, or at lea&s;t much wore out. That there may be &s;ome truth in the&s;e complaints, I will not
<PB N="44" REF="51">take upon me to deny:&mdash;But perhaps there may be other rea&s;ons which in &s;ome mea&s;ure contribute to lead people into this way of thinking. In this age of improvement, I appre|hend we examine more narrowly: We di&s;tingui&s;h with more per&s;picuity, and con&s;equently we judge more nicely. We are not content now, with judg|ing by one of our &s;en&s;es, as I believe u&s;ed to be the ca&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> by looking on &s;lightly; but we now join the &s;en&s;e of <HI>feeling</HI> to &s;eeing. The farmer of this day is not a&s;hamed to learn from the butcher to feel with the fingers, that touch-&s;tone of knowledge, in regard to the judging of animals already prepared, or to be prepared for the &s;hambles. We undoubtedly fir&s;t judge by the &s;ight; which being plea&s;ed, we bring the &s;en&s;e of feeling to its a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A nice or good judge of cattle and &s;heep, with a &s;light touch of the fingers upon the points of the animal, <HI>viz.</HI> the hips, rumps, ribs, flank, brea&s;t, twi&s;t, &s;houlder-&s;core, &amp;c. will know imme|diately whether it will make fat or not, and in which parts it will be the fatte&s;t, &amp;c.</NOTE>;

<P>From the&s;e, and &s;uch like rea&s;ons, I have been induced to believe that breeders and graziers are mi&s;led, or mi&s;taken at lea&s;t in a great mea&s;ure, re&s;pecting the breeds of cattle, &amp;c. being lo&s;t, and of cattle, &s;heep, &amp;c. being wor&s;e now than formerly.&mdash; The fact I apprehend is, that from our more refined notions, we are be|come wor&s;e to plea&s;e; and if matters go on in the right line, we &s;hall every day become nicer and clearer in our judgments of &s;tock, as well as other things. How is it probable that we &s;hould lo&s;e our be&s;t breeds of cattle?
<PB N="46" REF="53">or that our dome&s;tic animals &s;hould decline in real value? when &s;uch a laudible &s;pirit for the breeding of good &s;tock every-where prevails, and &s;uch an encouragement to it; for, tho' our corn-markets keep fluctuating, and of late years have been in com|mon below par in the north and ea&s;t parts of Britain, in proportion to the great advance in the rents of farms, yet the value of black cattle and &s;heep have kept progre&s;&s;ively advan|cing; &s;o that the importation of live-cattle from our &s;i&s;ter-kingdom, had not &s;uch a material effect as might have been expected.&mdash;But, to return to the breeders in Galloway, and even &s;uppo&s;ing their breed of cattle in &s;ome degree lo&s;t, yet there is little doubt not only of its being recovered, but &s;till more improved, when &s;uch a leading nobleman as Lord Selkirk is among the breeders.

Mr Craik, Mr Dalyell, and &s;everal others, have tried a cro&s;s from Mr. Bakewell's bulls; but how far this has &s;ucceeded, I have not yet been able to learn: indeed I do not &s;ee how they can judge them&s;elves with|out a fuller trial. But I found that the generality of the breeders were again&s;t cro&s;&s;ing with Mr Bakewell's or any other kind of cattle, believing that their real original polled breed had already been injured from cro&s;&s;|ing with different kinds.</P>
<P>Tho' the generality of their cattle are polled, yet they have &s;everal with horns, which they &s;ay are a ba&s;tard or mongrel breed, from cro&s;&s;ing with long-horned bulls from We&s;tmore|land and Cumberland. They prefer the polled ones, and of the&s;e the
<PB N="48" REF="55">black or dark-brindled ones, to any other; and all allow them to be the original breed of the county. The general weight of their &s;teers or oxen, is from forty to &s;ixty &s;tone, &s;ome reach &s;eventy and upwards.</P>
<P>KILOES, or <HI>Highland cattle,</HI> accord|ing to our arrangement, are the next to be treated of.&mdash;The&s;e hardy animals are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all that exten&s;ive and mountainous country called the Highlands of Scotland, together with the i&s;lands bounded on all &s;ides by the &s;ea and the Grampian hills, which, as I under&s;tand them, begin on the north &s;ide of the Frith of Clyde, and run into the ea&s;t &s;ea near Aberdeen. All the Lowlands of Scotland, except Galloway, which we have already treat|ed of, have a mixed breed of cattle. Towards Cumberland, they are half long-horns, half polls. On the bor|ders
<PB N="49" REF="56">of Northumberland, they are mix|ed with &s;hort-horns, until you reach near Teviotdale, when they become altogether a coar&s;e kind of &s;hort-horns, or what the York&s;hire jobbers call Runts; except a few pretty good &s;hort-horned cattle bred in that plea&s;ant and fine country the Tweed-&s;ide. This &s;ame kind of runti&s;h coar&s;e breed, continues all the way to the Frith of Forth. Cro&s;&s;ing this narrow &s;ea into Fife&s;hire, you would at fir&s;t imagine the Fife cattle a di&s;tinct breed, from their upright white horns like a Wel&s;h ox, being exceedingly light-lyered and thin-made; but I am pretty clear it is only from their being more nearly allied to the kiloes, and con&s;equently le&s;s of the coar&s;e kind of &s;hort-horns in them. The cattle all along this coa&s;t, continue to change more and more, growing &s;till le&s;s until upon the edges of the mountains they become
<PB N="50" REF="57">quite kiloes, but &s;till much inferior to that pure unmixed valuable breed of kiloes which we meet with in the more northern and We&s;t Highlands, and all the i&s;lands, but particularly the I&s;le of Skye, and that tract of country called Kintail. It is in the&s;e two noted places that you meet with the native breed of kiloes; a hardy, indu&s;trious, and excellent breed of cattle in every re&s;pect, calculated to thrive in a cold expo&s;ed mountainous country. When the&s;e are taken &s;outh, and grazed, they both feed very rea|dily, and afford remarkable good beef: their colours are black, brin|dled, or dun, in general; but the breeders here, like the Galloway people, prefer the black ones.</P>
<P>Prodigious numbers of the&s;e cattle are every autumn drove to the &s;outh|ward. Many of them are bought up by that great dealer Mr Birkwhi&s;tle,
<PB N="51" REF="58">for that we&s;tern di&s;trict of York&s;hire called Craven: many more are &s;ent into Norfolk, Suffolk, E&s;&s;ex, and other parts of the &s;outh of England, where they are fatted, and either &s;laughtered at their home-markets, or &s;ent to Smithfield. The demand for kiloes into England, is of va&s;t importance to the Nobility and Gentry who have e&s;tates in the North of Scotland, as the mo&s;t of their rents are paid in live cattle. The weight of the&s;e cattle runs in general from twenty to thirty-five &s;tone; &s;ome particular ones reach to more than forty.</P>
<P>THE <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Alderney</HI> breed of cat|tle, are only to be met with about the &s;eats of our Nobility and Gentry, up|on account of their giving exceeding rich milk to &s;upport the luxury of the tea-table. Indeed if it was not for the &s;ake of method, and my be|lieving
<PB N="52" REF="59">them a di&s;tinct breed, I might have &s;aved the trouble of naming them at all; as I imagine this breed too delicate and tender ever to be much attended to by our Briti&s;h farmers, for they are not able to bear the cold of this i&s;land, particularly the northmo&s;t parts of it. They are very fine-boned in general, light-red or yellow in colour, and their beef generally yel|low, or very high-coloured, tho' very fine in the grain, and well-flavoured. They make them&s;elves very fat; and I never remember &s;eeing one of them in the lea&s;t &s;ubject to lyer, or black-fle&s;hed; and I have &s;een &s;ome very u&s;eful cattle bred from a cro&s;s be|tween an Alderney cow and a &s;hort-horned bull.</P>
<P>WE come now to the <HI>&s;ixth</HI> and <HI>la&s;t</HI> di&s;tinct breed of cattle, according to our opinion, to be met with in this

<P>We were told by the park-keeper, that they always conceal their calves
<PB N="54" REF="61">from the fir&s;t dropping of them, which would be very difficult to find if he was not to watch the dam early or late, when &s;he goes privately to give it &s;uck; after which it immediately claps down again, among brakes, ru&s;hes, &amp;c. while &s;he &s;teals away with great caution.&mdash;We were al&s;o told that they feed well; that the beef is fine-grained, and well-flavoured; and in|deed their form denotes kindly fle&s;h, from what we could judge.</P>
<P>I had almo&s;t forgot to ob&s;erve, that when the park-keeper wants to ca&s;trate a calf, having previou&s;ly well marked the place where it is hid, he goes very &s;oftly till he &s;eizes his prey; then, after making as &s;hort work as po&s;&s;ible, he runs to his hor&s;e, (which is hooked as near as can be), and rides for his life; for, the fir&s;t noi&s;e of the calf, brings not only the dam, but the whole hord in&s;tantly;
<PB N="55" REF="62">and he told us that he &s;ometimes e&s;caped very narrowly, as it makes them quite outrageous: the &s;hooting of them is al&s;o attended with danger.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chillingham in Northumberland, a Seat be|longing to the Earl of Tankerville, is the only place where I have &s;een this curious wild breed, tho' I am told &s;ome others of our Nobility have of them.</NOTE></P>
<P>HAVING given a kind of hi&s;tory of the different breeds of cattle made u&s;e of in this i&s;land, we &s;hall now, ac|cording to promi&s;e, endeavour to point out the perfections and imperfections of each.&mdash;<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> then, the longhorns are mo&s;t remarkable for, and different from the other kinds, in the length of their horns, the thickne&s;s and firm text|ure of their hides, the length and thick|ne&s;s of their hair, &s;ize of their hoofs, and coar&s;e leathy thick necks: they likewi&s;e are deeper made in their fore|quarters, and lighter in the hind quar|ters,
<PB N="56" REF="63">than the other breeds in general: they are narrower in their &s;hape, le&s;s in point of weight than the &s;hort-horns, though better weighers in pro|portion to their &s;ize, and give con&s;i|derably le&s;s milk, though it is &s;aid to afford more cream in proportion: they are more varied in colour than any of the other breeds; but whatever the colour is, they have in general a white &s;treak or lace along their back, which the breeders term <HI>finched.</HI> They are under&s;tood by graziers to be in ge|neral rather flow-feeders; except that particular kind di&s;tingui&s;hed and re|commended by Mr. Bakewell: the&s;e are &s;aid to eat le&s;s food than the others, make remarkably fat in a &s;hort &s;pace of time, and lay their fat upon the mo&s;t valuable parts, but have little tallow in them when fed; and when u&s;ed to the dairy, give very little milk. It is al&s;o ob&s;ervable, that this kind
<PB N="57" REF="64">differ from the re&s;t of the long-horn|ed cattle, in having very fine clean &s;mall bones in their legs, and very thin hides. The &s;hort-horns differ from the other breeds in the &s;hort|ne&s;s of their horns, being wider and thicker in their form or mould, con|&s;equently feed to the mo&s;t weight; but the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential difference con|&s;i&s;ts in the quantity of milk they give beyond any other breed: their being tenderer than the other kinds, (the Alderney excepted), may probably be owing to giving &s;uch a large quantity of milk. Indeed they have in general very thin hides, and much le&s;s hair upon them than the other &s;orts, (Al|derneys always to be excepted); they al&s;o afford by much the mo&s;t tallow when fattened. It is &s;aid of this kind, and I &s;uppo&s;e very ju&s;tly, that they eat more food than any of the other breeds: nor &s;hall we wonder at this,
<PB N="58" REF="65">when we con&s;ider that they excel in tho&s;e three valuable particulars, <HI>viz.</HI> in affording the greate&s;t quantity of beef, tallow, and milk. Their colours are very much varied; but the gene|rality are red and white mixed, what the breeders call <HI>flecked,</HI> and when properly mixed is a very rich fine colour.</P>
<P>Speaking of the colours of neat cattle, reminds me of a conjecture which I will take the liberty of mentioning. In all the accounts of cattle relative to this i&s;land, which I have &s;een either in deeds or law-&s;tatutes, they are called <HI>black cattle.</HI> Now, I would only a&s;k, whether this does not &s;trengthen that opinion of the &s;hort-horned breeds being intro|duced from the Continent, perhaps &s;ome time after our &s;ea-coa&s;ts and low-country was improved and in|clo&s;ed? and before that period, is it
<PB N="59" REF="66">not probable we had mo&s;tly the &s;mall black cattle, which &s;till are to be met with in all the wild mountainous un|cultivated parts of Wales and Scot|land?</P>
<P>NOW we will &s;peak of the <HI>Gallo|way Breed,</HI> or <HI>Polled Cattle.</HI>&mdash;This va|luable breed &s;eems to be about as much le&s;s in weight and &s;ize to the long-horns, as the&s;e are to the &s;hort-horns; but they differ mo&s;t e&s;&s;en|tially from every other breed of cattle, in having no horns at all. Some few indeed (in every other re&s;pect polls) have two little unmeaning horns, two, three, or four inches long, hanging down loo&s;e from the &s;ame parts that other cattle's horns grow from, and are joined to the head by a little loo&s;e &s;kin and fle&s;h, and are &s;omewhat curious. In almo&s;t every other re|&s;pect (except wanting horns) the&s;e
<PB N="60" REF="67">cattle re&s;emble the long-horns both in colour and &s;hape; only they are &s;hort|er in their form, which probably makes them weight le&s;s. Indeed their hides &s;eem to be between the two la&s;t-mentioned breeds, not &s;o thick as the longhorns, nor &s;o thin as the &s;hort-horns; but, like the be&s;t feeding kind of the long-horns, they lay their fat upon the mo&s;t valuable parts, and their beef is more mixed with fat, or marbled, than the &s;hort-horns in ge|neral.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Kiloes</HI> come next in cour&s;e. The&s;e are &s;till le&s;s in proportion to the polled cattle than they are to the long-horns, or tho&s;e to the &s;hort-horns. The&s;e al&s;o are covered with a long thick coat of hair, like the polls and long-horns; and, like the&s;e, their beef is fine-grained, well-flavoured, and mixed or marbled, but not &s;o
<PB N="61" REF="68">hand&s;ome on the out&s;ide of the beef when killed, and not of &s;o bright a colour, but are often &s;potted with black, even upon the be&s;t parts, ex|cept when made very fat. Neverthe|le&s;s, the&s;e are a mo&s;t valuable breed of cattle, and better adapted perhaps to the cold regions where they are bred, than any other kind we are ac|quainted with. However, Admiral Sir John Lockhart-Ro&s;s, and &s;ome other &s;pirited Gentlemen, have tried &s;ome cro&s;&s;es between long-horned bulls, and the I&s;le of Skye cows. Whether this will an&s;wer the end de&s;ired or not, time will &s;hew; but whatever the re&s;ult may be, there is certainly great merit in the attempt.</P>
<P>As we have now gone through the perfections and imperfections of the&s;e four kinds of cattle, which I pre|&s;ume are the mo&s;t worthy the atten|tion
<PB N="62" REF="69">of our farmers, graziers, and breeders, (for I apprehend the Alder|ney and wild cattle are out of the que&s;tion, for rea&s;ons before given), we will beg leave to make a few com|pari&s;ons and ob&s;ervations before we conclude this &s;ubject; and in doing this, we &s;hall begin with the Kiloes fir&s;t, for rea&s;ons which will appear afterwards.</P>
<P>But, previous to that, I would ob|&s;erve, that though a breed of cattle may have much merit, and &s;uit &s;ome particular di&s;tricts exceedingly well, and better perhaps than any other kind we know of; yet it would be very ab&s;urd to a&s;&s;ert, that they would an&s;wer as well in every part of the country, or even in tho&s;e parts wherein they have not yet been tried: and ad|mitting that in &s;ome of tho&s;e parts they might an&s;wer exceedingly well, yet who will pretend to &s;ay that they will &s;uit in all?</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="70">From the&s;e con&s;iderations, I think my experienced Readers will readily agree with me, that though this very u&s;eful breed of little cattle &s;uit &s;o well upon the bleak hills in the North, as not to be in danger of being outdone by any other breed; yet that it would be very ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e they will an&s;wer to breed in tho&s;e rich grounds by the river-&s;ides, or in the fertile plains in our midland countries, bet|ter than the breeds already made u&s;e of in tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P>Let us then leave this indu&s;trious and hardy breed in quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their own mountains, and con&s;ider how far this will hold good with the polled cattle.</P>
<P>Although I am very clear in what has been &s;aid about the kiloes, yet I will not take upon me to &s;ay that the right Galloway cattle would not do in the be&s;t breeding grounds we have,
<PB N="64" REF="71">becau&s;e I confe&s;s that I have a very high opinion of this breed as quick true feeders, and as kindly fle&s;hed, or excellent eating beef, by which they have e&s;tabli&s;hed their character in the fir&s;t market in the i&s;land. How they would an&s;wer as dairy cows, I cannot pretend to &s;ay, as I want &s;ufficient in|formation to judge from.</P>
<P>Since I wrote the above, I have been informed from good authority, that the polled cows are very good milkers in proportion to their &s;ize, and the milk good in quality, which certainly adds to the value of this ex|cellent breed: that the oxen and &s;pay|ed heifers an&s;wer well for the draught. I have good authority to a&s;&s;ert, how|ever, as there is &s;uch a &s;imilarity be|twixt the be&s;t of the&s;e, and that breed of long-horns referred to before, and recommended by Mr Bakewell, we will leave them, and go to the&s;e long-horns;
<PB N="65" REF="72">but not without fir&s;t wi&s;hing that proper trials were made with the&s;e, and between the&s;e, the long-horns and &s;hort-horns, by breeders of judgment, experience, and attention in the differ|ent breeding counties in this i&s;land.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now return to the&s;e two breeds of cattle, the long-horns and &s;hort-horns, that are at pre&s;ent in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the be&s;t and greate&s;t part of this i&s;land. The&s;e two rival-breeds, between which it has long been a di&s;pute with the breeders of both, which are the be&s;t and mo&s;t advantageous, have been variou&s;ly in|termixed in different parts of Great Britain; but it is the two unmixed di&s;tinct breeds that we now mean to compare, and to the be&s;t of our know|ledge, in the mo&s;t unprejudiced man|ner, point out their different perfec|tions and imperfections, and then leave the candid experienced reader to form his own judgment.</P>

As we have already ob&s;erved, the long-horns excel in the thickne&s;s and firm texture of the hide, in the length and thickne&s;s of the hair, and con&s;e|quently mu&s;t be hardier; in their beef being finer grained and more mixed or marbled than the &s;hort-horns, better weighers in proportion to their &s;ize, and milk richer in quality: for as to their horns being longer, I do not think them either better or wor&s;e for that, and therefore do not bring it into the account. But they are inferior to the &s;hort-horns in giving a le&s;s quan|tity of milk, in weighing le&s;s upon the whole, in affording le&s;s tallow when killed, being in general &s;lower feeders, and in being coar&s;er made, and more leathery or bulli&s;h in the under &s;ide of the neck. In few words, the long-horns excel in the hide, hair, and quality of the beef,&mdash;the &s;hort|-horns in the quantity of beef, tallow,
<PB N="67" REF="76">and milk. Each breed have long had, and probably long may have their particular advocates; but if I may hazard a conjecture, is it not proba|ble that both kinds may have their particular advantages in different &s;itu|ations? Why may not the thick firm hides, and long clo&s;e-&s;et hair of the one kind, be a protection and &s;ecurity again&s;t tho&s;e impetuous winds and heavy rains to which the we&s;t coa&s;t of this i&s;land is &s;o &s;ubject, while the more regular &s;ea&s;ons and mild cli|mate upon the ea&s;t coa&s;t is more &s;uit|able to the con&s;titutions of the &s;hort-horns or Dutch breed. I would wi&s;h to be under&s;tood, that when I &s;ay the long-horns exceed the &s;hort-horns in the quality of the beef, I mean that preference is due to the particular breed of long-horns only taken notice of before, as &s;elected, di&s;tingui&s;hed, and recommended by that mo&s;t attentive
<PB N="68" REF="77">breeder Mr Bakewell; for as to the long-horned breed in common, I am inclined to think their beef rather in|ferior than &s;uperior to that of the ge|nerality of &s;hort-horns; and there is little doubt but a breed of &s;hort-horn|ed cattle might be &s;elected, equal, if not &s;uperior to even that very kindly-fle&s;hed &s;ort of Mr Bakewell's, pro|vided any able breeder or body of breeders had or would be at the &s;ame pains and pay the &s;ame attention to the&s;e that Mr Bakewell and his neigh|bours have done to the long-horns. But it has all along been the misfor|tune of the &s;hort-horned breeders to pur&s;ue the large&s;t and bigge&s;t-boned ones as the be&s;t, without con&s;idering that tho&s;e are the be&s;t that pay the mo&s;t money for their keeping in a given time. However, the ideas of our &s;hort-horned breeders being now more enlarged, and their minds more
<PB N="69" REF="78">open to conviction, we may hope in a few years to &s;ee great improvements made in that breed of cattle.</P>
<P>I have hitherto taken no notice of the <HI>Iri&s;h cattle,</HI> though it behoves the breeders in that i&s;land above all others in the Briti&s;h dominions to pay at|tention to the breeding of cattle, as beef is the &s;taple commodity of the i&s;land; and however Great Britain may have &s;uffered, it is highly pro|bable that the Iri&s;h have been bene|fited by the high price their beef has born during the war with America.&mdash; I take the Iri&s;h cattle to be a mixed breed between the long-horns and the Wel&s;h or Scotch, but mo&s;t inclined to the long-horns, though of le&s;s weight than tho&s;e in England. It is wonder|ful to con&s;ider the numbers of cattle that fertile i&s;land produces: I have &s;een at one fair at Ballina&s;loe in the
<PB N="70" REF="79">county of Ro&s;ecommon, I believe thirty-five thou&s;and head of cattle &s;hewn, and half of the&s;e fat ones, all bought up for the &s;laughter at Corke. Of late years, &s;everal of the Iri&s;h breeders have bought long-horned bulls and heifers at very high prices from Lanca&s;hire, Leice&s;ter&s;hire, War|wick&s;hire, &amp;c. particularly the Mr Frenches and other &s;pirited breeders from Ro&s;ecommon and different parts of the we&s;t of Ireland, which has been of very great advantage in im|proving their breed. I &s;aw &s;ome of the cattle de&s;cended from the&s;e cro&s;&s;es, &s;hewn at Ballina&s;loe-fair, which were greatly &s;uperior to any others &s;hewn there.</P>

<P><PB N="75" REF="84">WE &s;hall now proceed to the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> or <HI>Lincoln&s;hire breed.</HI>&mdash;This fertile county, as I have &s;aid before, has the &s;ame right I &s;uppo&s;e to be called the mother-county or country for long-wool'd &s;heep, that Lanca&s;hire has to long-horned cattle: But the compari|&s;on may be carried further; for as this la&s;t-named county, from paying too much attention to big bones, hide and horns, &s;uffered the Leice&s;ter&s;hire and Warwick&s;hire breeders to &s;teal from them their valuable breed above referred to, before they were well aware of it; &s;o al&s;o the Lincoln|&s;hire breeders, by too great a fond|ne&s;s for heavy wool and large-boned &s;heep, &s;uffered the &s;ame di&s;cerning &s;et of breeders from the midland counties, to rob them of a much more valuable breed of &s;heep, which they undoubtedly were fir&s;t in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of, before they were well &s;en&s;ible of the value of them.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="85">It is true that the Lincoln&s;hire breeders can ju&s;tly boa&s;t of clipping the greate&s;t weight of wool from a given number of &s;heep, of any other &s;et of people in this i&s;land: but then this very heavy wool &s;eldom or never fails to cover a very coar&s;e-grained carca&s;e of mutton; a kind of mutton well known for its large grain and big bones in the London markets, which not only &s;ells for le&s;s money by the pound in the metropolis than any other kind of mutton, and in every market in the i&s;land wherever they happen to be expo&s;ed to &s;ale, but has brought an odium upon the large mutton which the be&s;t kinds do not de&s;erve.</P>
<P>It is very well known that the mut|ton of that breed of &s;heep fir&s;t intro|duced by Mr Bakewell, and now &s;pread over mo&s;t parts of the i&s;land, is as remarkable for the finene&s;s of its
<PB N="77" REF="86">grain, as the Lincoln&s;hire &s;heep are for coar&s;e grain; the former is al&s;o as fine-flavoured and &s;weet as a moun|tain &s;heep, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing mo&s;t of the good qualities of the&s;e breeds without their bad ones: Yet this is not the wor&s;t of it; for this kind of &s;heep cannot be made fat in a rea&s;onable time in any part of the i&s;land except Romney-Mar&s;h, their own rich mar&s;hes in Lin|coln&s;hire, or &s;ome very rich grazing grounds. Perhaps this is the be&s;t rea|&s;on we can give for a &s;et of &s;en&s;ible men &s;o long adhering to this coar&s;e-grained &s;low-feeding tribe. Indeed the prodigious weight of wool which is annually &s;horn from the&s;e &s;heep, is an inducement to the mar&s;h-men to give great prices to the breeders for their hogs or hogerils (as they are there called), which though they mu&s;t be kept two years more before they get them fit for market, yet in the
<PB N="78" REF="87">mean time they get three clips of wool from them, which alone pays them well in tho&s;e rich mar&s;hes. However, I am very glad to find that the prejudices of the Lincoln&s;hire breeders are now giving way to their better-informed rea&s;on, as many of the great tupe-breeders in Lincoln|&s;hire are now hiring and buying rams from the midland counties; which is certainly the be&s;t, readie&s;t, and only method to recover that va|luable breed of &s;heep of which they fir&s;t were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and which they of any other county of Great Britain can make the mo&s;t advantage, from having the greate&s;t quantity of rich &s;heep pa&s;turage.</P>
<P>After what has been &s;aid, will it not appear very extraordinary, that not only the midland counties, but York|&s;hire, Durham, and even Northumber|land, can &s;end their long-wool'd breed
<PB N="79" REF="88">of &s;heep to market at two years old, fatter in general than Lincoln&s;hire can at three. It is a matter of fact, how|ever; and I have no doubt of clearing it up to the &s;atisfaction of my unpre|judiced readers in a few words.</P>
<P>The rich fat mar&s;hes in Lincoln|&s;hire are beyond any other county I know of in the i&s;land, be&s;t adapted to the growing and the forcing of long heavy wool. This, with the high price that kind of wool had given previ|ous to the late war, very probably induced the &s;heep-breeders of that county to pur&s;ue it &s;o ardently in preference to every other requi&s;ite, that they neglected the form of the carca&s;e and inclination to make readily fat; <HI>e&s;&s;entials</HI> that the other &s;heep-breeding counties were under a nece&s;|&s;ity of attending to, or otherwi&s;e they could not have got them made fat in proper time, from their land not
<PB N="80" REF="89">being in general near &s;o rich as the Lincoln&s;hire mar&s;hes. In &s;hort the Lincoln&s;hire breeders, by running &s;o much upon wool and large bones, lo&s;t the thick firm carca&s;e, broad flat back, fine clean &s;mall bone, and inclination to make fat; tho&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hing cha|racteri&s;tics of our be&s;t &s;heep, and for which the Leice&s;ter&s;hire breed is &s;o eminently con&s;picuous, the introduc|tion of which reflects &s;o much merit upon Mr Bakewell, who fir&s;t faw the advantages attending this mo&s;t u&s;eful breed, and who has &s;o &s;teadily pur|&s;ued it that he has now e&s;tabli&s;hed them in almo&s;t every corner of the&s;e i&s;lands; for, notwith&s;tanding this breed originated in Lincoln&s;hire, the ho|nour was re&s;erved to Mr Bakewell, of improving it to a pitch unknown in any former period.</P>
<P>The Lincoln&s;hire &s;heep were be|come like their black hor&s;es, two great
<PB N="81" REF="90">ends with a long thin weak middle. But they have another breed of &s;heep in Lincoln&s;hire, which I believe are now much wore out, &s;till wor&s;e than the other, and from whence they had them will not be ea&s;y to make out. It is more than probable the large breed has come from the Continent, as well as the &s;hort-horned cattle; but the&s;e &s;eem all their own: however we have none like them in this i&s;land that I know of, except what have &s;prung from Lincoln&s;hire. The &s;ort I refer to are ab&s;olutely dwarfs: every feature is expre&s;&s;ive of that di&s;agreeable de|ficiency &s;o &s;trongly marked in the dwarfs in our own &s;pecies; nor &s;hould I have named them here but as a matter of curio&s;ity: however they are well known in that county, and go by the name of Dunkies or Tunkies, perhaps a corruption of the word <HI>lonquin,</HI> from which the Chine&s;e pigs are vulgarly called Tunkies.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="91">It is nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that tho' we give the honour of the heavy-wool'd &s;heep's origin to Lincoln&s;hire as I have &s;aid before, yet I look upon tho&s;e to be only variations of the &s;ame breed, which are &s;pread through mo&s;t of our midland counties, particu|larly Marchland in Norfolk, the I&s;le of Ely, Northampton&s;hire, Rutland&s;hire, Leice&s;ter&s;hire, Warwick&s;hire, part of Oxford&s;hire, Gloce&s;ter&s;hire, Stafford|&s;hire and Darby&s;hire, Nottingham|&s;hire and the &s;outh parts of York|&s;hire, with all the York&s;hire wolds: But when we come North towards the river Tees which divides York|&s;hire from the county of Durham, we there find that large&s;t breed of &s;heep, in this i&s;land always called the Tees|water breed.&mdash;This kind differs from the Lincoln&s;hire, in their wool not being &s;o long and heavy, in &s;tanding upon higher though finer-boned legs;
<PB N="83" REF="92">yet &s;upporting a thicker, firmer, hea|vier carca&s;e, much wider upon their backs and &s;ides, and in affording a fatter and finer-grained ca&s;e of mut|ton. The&s;e &s;heep weigh from 20 to 25 <HI>lib. per</HI> quarter; &s;ome particular ones have been fed to 50 <HI>lb.</HI> and upwards. But Mr Thomas Hutchin&s;on of Smea|ton, an eminent breeder and grazier near the river Tees, fed a wedder|&s;heep, which was killed about Chri&s;t|mas, and weighed no le&s;s than 62 <HI>lb.</HI> 20 <HI>oz. per</HI> quarter, Avoirdupois; &s;uch an extraordinary weight as was never before heard of in this i&s;land by &s;e|veral pounds <HI>per</HI> quarter. The ewes of this breed generally bring two lambs each &s;ea&s;on, and &s;ometimes three, four, or even five.&mdash;But, &s;peak|ing of the fecundity of the&s;e &s;heep, puts me in mind of an account I had from a corre&s;pondent in regard to the fruitfulne&s;s of a ewe belonging to an
<PB N="84" REF="93">acquaintance of his, which I will beg leave to tran&s;cribe in his own words, for the &s;atisfaction of the curious part of my Readers.</P>

<NOTE><HI>N. B.</HI> The fir&s;t nine lambs were lambed within eleven months.</NOTE>
<P>It is only right to ob&s;erve, that this large breed, of &s;heep are not adapted to live in large flocks, or upon bare pa&s;tures: they require good ground, lying thin on, <HI>viz.</HI> few together or in &s;mall parcels, and great indulgence in winter. Accordingly we find, that in the fine tract of country by the Tees, where the&s;e &s;heep are principally
<PB N="85" REF="94">kept, the land is in general good, well &s;heltered, and cut into &s;mall inclo|&s;ures, where they keep a very &s;mall number in the &s;ame field, allow them to go to a hay-&s;tack all the winter, or to hecks or &s;heep-racks well &s;upplied in the field, and very frequently give the ewes corn in troughs previous to their lambing.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire breed of Sheep</HI> come next before us, and are &s;aid to bear lambs twice yearly. But I am inclined to believe this is a mi&s;take; for, ad|mitting that they may bring lambs twice in one particular year, yet they cannot well do it the next year, or for a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of years: or at lea&s;t if they &s;uckle their lambs, I think they cannot; becau&s;e when it is con&s;idered that a ewe goes with lamb twenty-one weeks, &s;he mu&s;t con&s;equently have only ten weeks to &s;uckle or feed her
<PB N="86" REF="95">two different breeds before &s;he takes the ram again, which will &s;carce &s;uf|fice<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Since I wrote the above, I have been inform|ed by a corre&s;pondent, that the Dor&s;et&s;hire ewes are capable of bringing lambs twice a-year; be|cau&s;e my friend tells me, from a peculiarity in their con&s;titution, they will take the ram two days after lambing, but do not conceive: however, eight days after that, they have a &s;econd embrace, when they mo&s;t generally prove with lamb, notwith&s;tanding they give &s;uck at the &s;ame time.</NOTE> But the peculiar property of this curious breed of &s;heep, and what makes them &s;o exceedingly conveni|ent and advantageous to breed from, is, that you can have them to lamb at whatever &s;ea&s;on of the year you choo&s;e, &s;o as to have that particular kind of fat lamb called hou&s;e-lamb, which is &s;o early found at the tables of the Nobility and Gentry, and even among our trade&s;men in the&s;e luxuri|ous times, and which are brought to London market by Chri&s;tmas or &s;ooner
<PB N="87" REF="96">if wanted, and after that a con&s;tant and regular &s;upply is kept up all the winter. At their fir&s;t appearance, they are frequently &s;old for half-a|guinea, fifteen &s;hillings, and &s;ome|times more <HI>per</HI> quarter; from which time they lower gradually in price until the &s;pring affords plenty. The lambs are impri&s;oned in little dark cabbins or cupboards, where they never &s;ee the light except when the &s;hepherd &s;uckles them upon the ewes. The ewes are fed with oil-cake, hay, corn, and turnips, cabbages, or any other green food which that &s;ea&s;on affords: the&s;e are given them in a field or clo&s;e contiguous to the lamb apart|ments, whereunto at proper times the attendant brings the nur&s;es, and while the lambs &s;uck, their lodgings are made perfectly clean, and littered with fre&s;h &s;traw. Va&s;t attention is paid to this, for very much depends upon,
<PB N="88" REF="97">cleanline&s;s. Thus are invention and indu&s;try exerted to the utmo&s;t, to &s;up|ply the wants of luxury.</P>
<P>It u&s;ed to be &s;aid &s;ome years ago, that this mo&s;t &s;ingular breed of &s;heep would not bring lambs &s;o early ex|cept in the &s;outhern parts of England, and that it was much owing to a par|ticular mode of treatment practi&s;ed by the &s;hepherds and breeders in Dor|&s;et&s;hire and the neighbouring coun|ties, &s;uch as heating the ewes by driv|ing, &amp;c. and then turning the rams to them. Others again a&s;&s;erted, that it was owing to the particular herbage produced upon the Dor&s;et&s;hire downs. But the&s;e imaginary notions are now all exploded, becau&s;e it is well known that York, Durham, Newca&s;tle, and even Edinburgh, are of late years &s;upplied with Chri&s;tmas hou&s;e-lamb from the Dor&s;et&s;hire &s;heep, without any particular arts being made u&s;e of.
<PB N="89" REF="98">This breed of &s;heep are white-faced, and mo&s;t of them have horns, &s;tand upon high &s;mall legs, long and thin in the carca&s;e, and va&s;t numbers of them without any wool upon their bellies, e&s;pecially in Wilt&s;hire, which gives them a very uncouth appearance to &s;trangers. They produce a &s;mall quan|tity of wool; but that is very fine in quality, though it varies in different di&s;tricts. The mutton of the&s;e &s;heep is al&s;o very &s;weet, and well-flavour|ed. The variations of this breed are &s;pread through mo&s;t of the &s;outhern counties; but the true kind is only to to be found in Dor&s;et&s;hire and Wilt|&s;hire. There is a breed not unlike the&s;e in Norfolk and Suffolk, which they fold on their fallows, but they are all grey or black-faced, and mo&s;t of tho&s;e I have &s;een in the we&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, Worce&s;ter&s;hire, Here|ford&s;hire, &amp;c.; though &s;ome of them,
<PB N="90" REF="99">very different from the Dor&s;et&s;hire, are I apprehend only variations of this breed, which variations continue northward until they are lo&s;t among&s;t tho&s;e of the Lincoln&s;hire breed.</P>
<P>They have a particular breed of &s;heep, mo&s;tly horned, in that we&s;tern part of York&s;hire adjoining Lanca|&s;hire called Craven, and the Sun|dales. I know not which breed to an|nex them to, but I think they have a good deal of the Dor&s;et&s;hire in them, e&s;pecially their horns and white faces.</P>
<P>After leaving the&s;e to the north|wards, we fir&s;t meet with that hardy, black-faced, wild-looking tribe, which in the borders are called the &s;hort &s;heep, in contra-di&s;tinction to that other border-breed which we &s;hall next treat of, and generally known by the appellation of long &s;heep. The &s;hort kind, then, we have ob&s;erved,
<PB N="91" REF="100">begin &s;omewhere in the northwe&s;t of York&s;hire, and are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all that hilly or rather mountainous track of country adjoining the Iri&s;h &s;ea, from Lanca&s;hire &s;outhward, to Fort-William northward. Indeed their migration into the We&s;tern High|lands of Scotland, has only been of late years; nor is there the lea&s;t doubt of their an&s;wering equally as well in the mountains of Argyle&s;hire, as in tho&s;e of We&s;tmoreland and Cumber|land: for, it is well known, that the climate is pretty much the &s;ame in all that rugged coa&s;t, having almo&s;t un|interrupted rains and &s;trong winds. Indeed the Galloway and Ayr&s;hire &s;heep are in &s;ome degree different; but I take it only to be a variation probably from cro&s;&s;es between the&s;e and the long &s;heep. But, within the&s;e few years, they have in the&s;e two counties been making &s;ome trials of
<PB N="92" REF="101">that mo&s;t u&s;eful kind of &s;heep, be&s;t known by the name of the Di&s;hley's breed; and every friend to his country will be glad to hear, when I now in|form him that they have hitherto &s;uc|ceeded beyond expectation. Nor will any per&s;on conver&s;ant with breeding &s;heep, be &s;urpri&s;ed at this; becau&s;e they are in every re&s;pect as well or better calculated to thrive in the flat country and lower hills, as the black-faced ones are for the mountains.</P>
<P>This hardy race differ from our other breeds, not only in their dark complection and horns, but princi|pally in the long coar&s;e &s;hagged wool which grows upon the&s;e mountaineers. The fleece is not unlike the hair grow|ing upon a water-&s;paniel, and is &s;el|dom &s;old higher than from 1&frac12; d. to 3 d. <HI>per lib.</HI> Their eyes have a very fierce wild ca&s;t: they run with a&s;toni&s;hing agility, and &s;eem quite adapted to
<PB N="93" REF="102">the&s;e heathy mountains that run along all the we&s;t of Scotland, and the northwe&s;t of England: they are &s;eldom fed until they be three, four, or five years old, when the mutton is &s;aid to be excellent, and gravy high-flavoured. The three great fairs for the&s;e &s;heep, and where amazing num|bers of them are &s;old every year, is Stag&s;hawbank in Northumberland, Appleby in We&s;tmoreland, and Lin|ton in Scotland. I have been told that they have been trying this breed in tho&s;e remote parts to the north of the Murray-Frith, <HI>viz.</HI> Ro&s;s-&s;hire, Sutherland, and Caithne&s;s; nor is there a doubt of their an&s;wering better than the kind they have, which are the la&s;t breed in our arrangement, and which we &s;hall de&s;cribe by and by.</P>
<P>But fir&s;t let us give &s;ome account of the long &s;heep, which though next neighbours to the &s;hort ones, are al|mo&s;t
<PB N="94" REF="103">as different from them as &s;heep from goats: for, as the latter are horn|ed, black-faced and black-legged, coar&s;e &s;hagged open wool, with very &s;hort firm carca&s;es; the others, on the con|trary, have long thin carca&s;es, thick planted fine tender wool, white-faced, white-legged, and without horns. In|deed &s;ome few of the&s;e are &s;peckled in the face and legs; but tho&s;e are a mixed breed from the two kinds be|ing probably cro&s;&s;ed at different times where they have been &s;o very long neighbours: For, as you leave the heights of Annandale to the ea&s;tward, you in&s;en&s;ibly loo&s;e the &s;hort &s;heep and mixed breed; after which, all tho&s;e exten&s;ive fine green hills on both the Scotch and Engli&s;h borders from Red|water &s;outhward, and on all &s;ides of the mountains of Cheviot until you join the barren heaths of Lam|mer-muir northwards, are covered
<PB N="95" REF="104">with the long breed:&mdash;a kind of &s;heep in my own humble opinion, very ill calculated for a mountainous country, particularly tho&s;e to the &s;outhward called Redwater &s;heep, which are formed more like a fox than a &s;heep. Indeed the fine herbage which the&s;e border hills every-where produce, &s;up|ports the&s;e &s;heep &s;o well in &s;ummer as to enable them the better to &s;tand the &s;everity of their winters. Great numbers of the&s;e &s;heep are &s;old in York&s;hire when three years old, and when fed there upon turnips, &amp;c. have the character of what the butch|ers call dying to their handling, and affording good eating mutton: their wool is &s;o light as not to weigh more than 2&frac12; or 3 lb. <HI>per</HI> fleece; however it fetches a pretty good price.&mdash;Colonel Selby of Pa&s;ton, in particular, who has paid much attention to his wool, generally &s;ells as high as 9 d. or 10 d.
<PB N="96" REF="105"><HI>per</HI> pound. The wool of all this country, for want of home-manufac|tories, either goes to Scotland, even as far as Aberdeen and Peterhead, or in|to York&s;hire, to Leeds, Bradford, &amp;c. to the latter mo&s;tly by land-carriage: But what is mo&s;t extraordinary, a part of this wool, after being combed at Leeds, &amp;c. returns into Scotland to be &s;pun; then is conveyed back to be made into &s;tuffs, a part of which once more returns to Scotland for the people to wear. However, the indu&s;trious North-Britons are now e&s;tabli&s;hing woollen manufactories in every corner, which I am well informed are patrio|tically &s;upported by the fir&s;t Nobility in Scotland; and it were to be wi&s;hed that the Nobility and Gentry in Nor|thumberland would imitate &s;o laud|ible an example. Such e&s;tabli&s;hments would in all probability very &s;oon prevent the&s;e very expen&s;ive and tardy conveyances.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="106">All the low parts of Northumber|land have a mixed breed of &s;heep be|tween the long kind, the Tees-water, and the Lincoln&s;hire;&mdash;in general a very tender, aukward, unprofitable breed, though much better than the kind they u&s;ed to breed, which were properly enough called Mugs, and were no other I pre&s;ume than a larger kind of long &s;heep, perhaps from their better keeping in the low-coun|tries; for they were mugged or wool'd into the very eyes. Some rem|nants of this breed that I have &s;een, have their wool &s;o grown about their eyes, that the poor animals could &s;carce &s;ee to eat or pick out the gra&s;s. This mug or muff, by every breeder and grazier of experience in the&s;e days, is looked upon as a certain in|dication of a &s;oft, tender, &s;low-thriv|ing &s;ort, while the chearful open coun|tenance, without any wool upon the

However, &s;ince Mr Bakewell's breed has made its way into Northumber|land, their &s;heep are very much im|proved; and they can now not only make them fat at an earlier date, but help to &s;upply Newca&s;tle, Shields, and Sunderland, and all tho&s;e populous environs, with as fat mutton as either the county of Durham or York&s;hire; and a va&s;t quantity of fat &s;heep (as well as lambs in the &s;ea&s;on) are week|ly &s;old in Morpeth from the North<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">From the north parts of this improving coun|ty, and both &s;ides of the Tweed, becau&s;e the na|tives of Scotland not having yet learned to eat fat mutton like the pitmen and keelm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n about New|ca&s;tle, induces the Borderers to &s;end their fatte&s;t mutton to Morpeth-market rather than Edin|burgh, where the con&s;umption of mutton is very &s;mall indeed compared with Newca&s;tle, though pretty much increa&s;ed of late years.</NOTE>,

<P><PB N="114" REF="125">The Author cannot illu&s;trate the above in a better or &s;tronger manner, than by the relation of an anecdote concerning him&s;elf, which tho' di&s;|graceful at the period when it hap|pened, proves the misfortune of a narrow education and illiberal ideas. "An elder brother of the Author's, and al&s;o bred to rural bu&s;ine&s;s more than twenty years ago, happened by chance to take a journey into the mid|land counties. On his return, he was relating with great candour how much better the &s;heep were in Leice&s;ter&s;hire than any we had:&mdash;How, Sir, (replies the pre&s;en. Writer in rather a con|temptuous tone) will you pretend to &s;ay that there are any &s;heep to be found &s;o good as what we have in this neighbourhood? You mu&s;t not make me believe this neither!&mdash;Well, Well, George, rejoins my elder and truly wi&s;er brother, I hope to be able to prevail on my father to allow you to
<PB N="115" REF="126">go up next year, and I am not afraid but you will come home a convert. The fact was that George went, and not only returned a convert, but, like mo&s;t <HI>turn-coats,</HI> a more zealous advo|cate for the new cau&s;e than the old one."&mdash;I beg the Reader's pardon for this digre&s;&s;ion; but I was led to it by reflecting upon the ab&s;urdity of narrow-minded people in all coun|tries, and the hindrance it is to the progre&s;s of knowledge; for I am afraid there are many at this day as wedded and begotted to old mi&s;taken opinions as the Author was twenty-five years ago. But if the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t of men have been unable to remove the prejudices and ob&s;tinate opinions of mankind, it may be a&s;ked, what right has one farmer to expect to correct the errors of his brethren, be he ever &s;o de&s;irous? I an&s;wer, as the intention is good, it is to be hoped that it may have &s;ome effect.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="127">But, as a confirmation of what I have been &s;aying, allow me to ac|quaint you with the ab&s;urd opinions of many of our more &s;outhern breed|ers, from whom we &s;hould rea&s;onably have expected better, as being nearer the metropolis, from whence we look for wi&s;dom and knowledge.</P>
<P>A Norfolk &s;heep-breeder &s;ays, &s;heep &s;hould be black-faced, and black-legged, and that their horns &s;hould come out forward, and turn in &s;uch a manner as you can &s;ee the ears through or behind the circle of the horns.&mdash;A Wilt&s;hire &s;heep-breeder, on the contrary, &s;ays, that &s;heep &s;hould have <HI>white</HI> faces, and <HI>white</HI> legs, and that their horns &s;hall come out back|wards, in &s;uch a manner that the ears may be &s;een before the horns.&mdash;But a Su&s;&s;ex breeder in&s;i&s;ts upon it that they are both wrong; becau&s;e &s;heep &s;hould be <HI>grey</HI>-faced and <HI>grey</HI>-legged,
<PB N="117" REF="128">and have no <HI>horns.</HI>&mdash;Thus you &s;ee how perfectly different the&s;e noted people are in their opinions; and they &s;urely cannot all be right, though they mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly think &s;o. But the counties are not more variable in appearance, than the breeders are in opinion; opi|nions founded in ab&s;urdity, and re|pugnant to every principle of com|mon &s;en&s;e. Nay, I was told that the coming out of the horns an inch near|er, or an inch further from the ears of a ram, made at lea&s;t five guineas difference in his price.</P>
<P>On a&s;king a butcher's wife at Bury in Suffolk, how &s;he &s;old mutton?&mdash;Five|pence <HI>per lib.</HI> Sir, an&s;wered &s;he &s;martly. And pray, replied I, rather &s;urpri&s;ed at the high price, have you no mutton below fivepence? O yes, Sir, rejoins the hone&s;t woman, plenty of Lincoln|&s;hires at 4 d. and 4&frac12; d.; but we do not account it mutton when compared
<PB N="118" REF="129">with our Norfolk or Suffolk mutton. And if I dare &s;peak out my poor opi|nion, they would neither of them be accounted mutton in many markets even further North in this i&s;land; the Lincoln&s;hire, on account of its coar&s;e|ne&s;s, the other on account of the thinne&s;s, and both for having too much bone in proportion to the meat. For I aver, that no large-boned animal will feed &s;o quick, or cover &s;o readily and thick with mu&s;cular fle&s;h, as one with a &s;mall bone, if well formed. This is the criterion,&mdash;this is the main principle that we found our judgment upon re&s;pecting all animals which are to be fatted for the &s;laughter or the con&s;umption of mankind; and we can ju&s;tly &s;ay, that this judgment is confirmed by more than thirty years experience. But, notwith&s;tanding this a&s;&s;ertion is made with &s;ome degree of po&s;itivene&s;s, yet we are not uncon|&s;cious
<PB N="119" REF="130">of its being a <HI>new doctrine</HI> to the generality of the breeders in this i&s;land, and con&s;equently will appear &s;urpri&s;ing and &s;trange to many old breeders and graziers or feeders. But I have not a remaining doubt, if they will only make fair candid trials, the &s;mall bones will win or gain the prize nine times out of ten, or rather every time. Nay I am inclined to think that the fine &s;mall-boned true pro|portioned animal will pay 3&frac12; d. per|haps 4 d, while the big-boned one will only pay 3 d. for what it eats, and in that proportion. When I a&s;&s;ert this, I would wi&s;h to be under&s;tood that I mean from the time of calving or lambing, to the time of killing for the market; becau&s;e, permit me to &s;ay, that I look upon the grazier who buys in and feeds, and he that breeds and feeds tho&s;e he breeds, as two very different people. It is the latter of
<PB N="120" REF="131">the&s;e that the world is obliged to for tho&s;e nice but valuable di&s;tinctions of &s;mall-boned animals excelling large-boned ones in feeding. He &s;ees, watches, and examines the various pu&s;hes and improvements from the beginning to the ending; while the grazier who buys in his &s;tock, is ea&s;y in a great mea&s;ure how they are bred, &s;o long as they pay him for feeding. A plain coar&s;e ugly animal may pay him more than a fine well-made one, be|cau&s;e he buys the coar&s;e one at much le&s;s price in proportion, and it is of little con&s;equence to him as an indi|vidual: But, to his country, to the community at large, it is a matter of prodigious importance, much more than has in general been thought of; becau&s;e the more meat and le&s;s bone you can produce from a given quan|tity of pa&s;turage of turnips, cabbage, &amp;c. the better &s;urely, and the more
<PB N="121" REF="132">mouths you mu&s;t feed.&mdash;Well, but give me leave to return for a few mo|ments to the Norfolk or Suffolk mut|ton, or indeed any of the&s;e &s;heep that are to be met with in mo&s;t of the &s;outh|ern counties; I mean all tho&s;e that are formed more like deer than &s;heep. Do not be &s;urpri&s;ed when I tell you, that a per&s;on who has been bred among&s;t the &s;heep in the midland counties, I mean the long-wool'd polled &s;heep in general, and had never &s;een any of the&s;e deer-like &s;heep, until by accident a drove happens to pa&s;s the country where he lives, would never take them to be &s;heep, but would &s;uppo&s;e them to be a &s;pecies bred between the goat, the deer, and &s;ome foreign &s;heep; for their legs are &s;o very long, and their bodies &s;o exceedingly &s;mall, which, with their large horns and low necks, gives them an appearance altogether uncouth, and totally different from the
<PB N="122" REF="133">polled &s;heep with long wool. La&s;t winter, 1784, we mea&s;ured the horns of &s;ome of the Norfolk and Suffolk rams, and found them from 35 to 37 inches long following the turn of the horn, and 9 or 9&frac12; round at the root or &s;etting on at the head; and indeed a very formidable appearance ten or a dozen of the&s;e animals make together.</P>
<P>Well, but we were told that the&s;e long-legged long &s;mall-bodied &s;heep are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of many good qualities that the long-wool'd &s;heep are not.&mdash; In the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place, they are better tra|vellers; which I will not deny, for many flocks travel a round of three, four, or five miles every day from and to the fold again. This I am wil|ling to believe, and it may al&s;o be very right; but as I never con&s;idered exer|ci&s;e conducive to feeding, tho' it may to health, I &s;hall not adopt this idea. They may want them to live long; and
<PB N="123" REF="134">if &s;o, they are right to give them proper exerci&s;e. Our's, on the contrary, we wi&s;h to be fat as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, or in fact never to be lean if we can help it, con&s;equently do not care how little exerci&s;e they get.&mdash;2dly, They &s;ay the&s;e &s;heep are le&s;s &s;ubject to the itch than our's. This may al&s;o be true; and from the &s;mall quantity of wool they grow, I &s;hould think them ea&s;ier cured of that di&s;order.&mdash;3dly and <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> They excel our's in quantity and rich|ne&s;s of gravy, what they call <HI>claret</HI>-coloured gravy. This I al&s;o give up: nor do I envy them in this mutton at all; for in proportion as your mutton is fat or lean, in &s;uch ratio I believe will be the gravy; the more lean, the blacker or claret-coloured; the fatter the mutton, the lighter coloured and more oil among the gravy: in &s;hort, the more deer-like the &s;heep are, as I &s;aid before, or the more they incline
<PB N="124" REF="135">to veni&s;on, I believe the higher colour|ed the gravy is; and on the contrary, the more they incline to mutton, the lighter coloured and more oil. And further, the gravy-mutton is always open-grained and porous; the fat mut|ton, on the contrary, clo&s;e-grained and firm.</P>
<P>And now, Mr Reader, you &s;hall be proprietor or landlord; I your tenant and &s;heep-breeder, and that in fact is my &s;ituation. I will not object to your keeping and eating that kind of mut|ton; and I am &s;ure you will wi&s;h bet|ter to your tenant than find fault with him for breeding and feeding the fat kind with oily gravy: For the&s;e ob|vious rea&s;ons, becau&s;e you have no rent to pay;&mdash;I have; therefore, tho' you may indulge your palate with claret-coloured gravy, I am &s;ure you will indulge me with the fat gravy and &s;olid meat for my&s;elf and family,
<PB N="125" REF="136">that the plowmen may be able to work for turnips to feed more of this fat mutton; but above all, that I may be able to pay my rent, and keep the wolf from the door. The fact is, Mr Reader, or Mr Landlord, that while the veni&s;on mutton pays threepence for breeding and feeding, the other will pay fourpence. And until you, Gen|tlemen, will make it our intere&s;t to produce the former, we certainly &s;hall produce the latter; becau&s;e it clearly is, and ever will be the intere&s;t of the farmer and breeder, to pur&s;ue that mode which turns to the be&s;t account, that culture which produces the mo&s;t profitable crops, and to produce tho&s;e animals which pay the mo&s;t for what they cat.

<PB N="126" REF="137">parts of this i&s;land, which of the two kinds of mutton they prefer? Would they not readily an&s;wer, Take you the lean meat, large-boned, and black gravy, but give us the &s;mall-boned fat with oil &s;wiming in the di&s;h? And are not the&s;e the men that make the greate&s;t con&s;umption in fat mutton, beef, &amp;c.?</P>
<P>On going to market one day to &s;ell our fat &s;heep, I was overtaken by a Gentleman from Scotland. Farmer, &s;aid the Gentleman, you make your &s;heep &s;o fat that I could not eat the mutton. It matters not, Sir, replied I, becau&s;e we have plenty of cu&s;tomers for this kind of mutton; and allow me to &s;ay, it is very happy that the great con&s;umption does not depend upon &s;uch as you. Upon my word, Sir, &s;aid he, I believe you are very right. In exact proportion as your breed of &s;heep approaches to the fat
<PB N="127" REF="138">kind, the mutton is not only marbled or mixed with fat in the lean or lyer, but the mutton is covered with fat over every part. On the contrary, the other &s;ort only covers with fat very partially on particular places, and little or none mixed with the lean: if it did, it would be a misfortune, becau&s;e the gravy would be &s;poiled.</P>
<P>But I had almo&s;t forgot one reputed excellence of the gravy &s;heep: It is &s;aid they die fuller of fat on the in|&s;ide. I grant they do; but di&s;pute its being an excellence upon the whole. I will endeavour to explain my&s;elf.&mdash; It is a well-known fact to all expe|rienced feeders or graziers, that tho&s;e animals which lay the fat on quicke&s;t on the out&s;ide, have the lea&s;t within in proportion; but then they are the very &s;ort that pay the mo&s;t for keep|ing; and con&s;equently, that &s;ort that pay the mo&s;t for keeping, though
<PB N="128" REF="139">they have the le&s;s fat on the in&s;ide, excel tho&s;e that have more fat with|in, in exact proportion as they pay more in a given time for what they eat.&mdash;But &s;ome will &s;ay the butcher has the mo&s;t profit upon tho&s;e that tallow be&s;t, or lay the fat within. I &s;ay not; becau&s;e if you will allow the butcher the &s;ame profit upon the quick feeders, or tho&s;e that put the fat on the out&s;ide, he will always buy the&s;e, becau&s;e he can &s;ell two joints for one: and &s;urely you can better afford to do this to the butcher.&mdash;But the fact is, the butcher can always buy the&s;e lean lumbering coar&s;e ani|mals, that lay little fat without, and much within, for &s;o much le&s;s <HI>per</HI> &s;tone that they afford him a profit. But &s;urely this can be no inducement to either breeding or feeding them; con|&s;equently no excellence, but the con|trary. Perhaps &s;ome Readers may
<PB N="129" REF="140">think I have dwelt longer upon the&s;e dry di&s;qui&s;itions than was nece&s;&s;ary; but I flatter my&s;elf the experienced Reader will excu&s;e me, when he reflects of what great importance it is to the community at large, and individuals in particular, to breed u&s;eful rather than unu&s;eful animals.&mdash;I confe&s;s this con&s;ideration made me very &s;oli|citious to impre&s;s the idea &s;trongly upon the minds of my brother breed|ers: For, if one &s;pecies of wheat, of oats, barley, or of turnips, &amp;c. are better worth propagating than an|other, &s;urely it will hold good in ani|mals; and there can be no doubt that the more it is con&s;idered, the more it will be attended to.</P>
<P>I will beg leave to make a few re|marks on beef and mutton when ex|po&s;ed to &s;ale in pieces on the &s;hambles or &s;tall.&mdash;When we con&s;ider that the
<PB N="130" REF="141">difference between what is called the coar&s;e and fine, or the be&s;t and wor&s;e parts of beef when cut up, is not le&s;s than one hundred <HI>per cent.</HI> of what va&s;t con&s;equence then mu&s;t it be to the breeder to propagate tho&s;e cattle that have the greate&s;t proportion of the&s;e valuable parts! And if I am right in what I &s;aid before, it will follow, that the &s;mall-boned true-pro|portioned cattle are the very &s;ort that produce more fine than coar&s;e, that lay their fat upon the valuable parts, and always feed in much le&s;s time than the big-boned coar&s;e &s;ort.</P>
<P>But it is not &s;o with mutton: the difference in value between one joint of mutton and another is &s;carce worth naming. In different parts of the kingdom, they give a preference to particular joints; but the variation is &s;eldom more than a farthing or half|penny <HI>per</HI> pound at mo&s;t. Neverthe|le&s;s
<PB N="131" REF="142">it is &s;till right for the breeder to pur&s;ue that &s;pecies which pay mo&s;t for what they eat; and the&s;e, I appre|hend, will always be found to be the &s;mall-boned true-formed &s;heep, as de|&s;cribed before: For, they not only pro|duce the fine&s;t-grained mutton, but more of it in a given time, in propor|tion to offal, than any other &s;ort of &s;heep I know of.&mdash;But in &s;peaking of offal here, I would be under&s;tood to mean further than what the butchers generally do. By offal they mean hide and tallow only in neat cattle, or &s;kin and tallow in &s;heep, and &s;o on: But by offal in this place, I would take in not only hide or &s;kin, and tallow, but bones, horns, pelts in &s;heep<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">There is &s;ometimes not le&s;s than 20 lib. weight difference between the pelts of one &s;ort of &s;heep and another, between the fine thin pelt and the thick coar&s;e gummy one.</NOTE>, blood, guts, and garbage, and even wool and hair. And, however new the idea,
<PB N="132" REF="143">I believe it will in general be found, that the truer and finer the form of an animal, the better quality and greater the quantity of fle&s;h when fatted; and in proportion, not only le&s;s hide or &s;kin and tallow, but le&s;s bone, horn, pelt, blood, guts, and garbage, and even wool and hair: And on the contrary, the clum&s;ier and coar&s;er the form, the fle&s;h will in general be of a wor&s;e quality and le&s;s in quantity when fatted; and in exact proportion, not only more hide or &s;kin and tal|low, but more bone, horn, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Upon this principle, &s;uppo&s;e two bullocks or two &s;heep are fatted to|gether, no matter whether upon pa|&s;ture, clover, turnips, or what you plea&s;e, the one as remarkable for coar&s;ene&s;s as the other for finene&s;s, or in any proportion you will, it will always hold good in that proportion; and admitting the coar&s;e one eats only
<PB N="133" REF="144">as much as the other, tho' I have no doubt of his eating more, &s;till a con|&s;iderable part of his food mu&s;t go to the &s;upport of more hide or pelt, bones, &amp;c. while the other's food is principally converted into animal fle&s;h; which fle&s;h, on an average, call only worth 3 d. <HI>per</HI> lib. I am afraid the horns, bone, pelt, &amp;c. are not worth above a farthing <HI>per</HI> lib. con&s;equently a very great lo&s;s to the community. Indeed the hide of a bullock is &s;ome|times worth as much <HI>per</HI> lib. as his fle&s;h; and particularly firm &s;trong hides, what are generally called lea|ther hides, are worth more, perhaps 6 d. <HI>per</HI> lib; but then the&s;e very thick hides almo&s;t generally cover a very &s;low-feeding carca&s;e. And tho' the coar&s;e hairy wool is always worth &s;omething <HI>per</HI> lib. yet that coar&s;e hairy wool cannot grow but upon a thick gummy pelt, which nece&s;&s;arily
<PB N="134" REF="145">covers a coar&s;e-grained &s;low-feeding carca&s;e of mutton. The pelt it&s;elf, tho' perhaps from 15 to 25 lib. weight, (nay &s;ome have been known to weigh 30 lib. or more), not worth more than 2 d. or 3 d.; for the thinner the pelt, the more valuable.</P>
<P>THE folding of &s;heep in many parts of this i&s;land, is looked upon as a mat|ter of con&s;iderable con&s;equence to the farmer. I confe&s;s I cannot &s;ee it in &s;o advantageous a light; but as it is a matter I have not experienced in a very great degree, I would be cautious of condemning a practice &s;o univer&s;|ally u&s;ed in many of the &s;heep-breed|ing counties in this kingdom. How|ever, &s;o far as we can go with &s;afety, we may venture to make a few ob|&s;ervations; and the&s;e ob&s;ervations I would wi&s;h to be under&s;tood as re|&s;pecting &s;ingle farms only, exclu&s;ive
<PB N="135" REF="146">of any right of commonage, or ad|jacent open fields, &amp;c.&mdash;If your farm is inclo&s;ed, or put only into &s;hifts, or any other divi&s;ions, it matters not, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e your flocks depa|&s;tured upon &s;ome part of the farm, for in&s;tance &s;ay the field A, and are folded every night upon B: Now, I think in proportion as they enrich B, they mu&s;t rob or impoveri&s;h A; or if they eat all day upon the field C, and lodge at night in D, it is the &s;ame thing, and &s;o on wherever they eat and &s;leep. Only I will admit it a convenience, and a pre&s;ent advantage, that &s;uppo&s;ing B field fallow and intended for tur|nips, &amp;c. while perhaps you have not a &s;ufficiency of manure to &s;pread upon it all; in that ca&s;e, folding your &s;tore-&s;heep upon the fallow, is perhaps getting you a crop of turnips where they might not otherwi&s;e be had; for well I know, that it is not ea&s;y to get
<PB N="136" REF="147">turnips upon many grounds without manure; and this matter we frequently have practi&s;ed, tho' &s;till it is <Q>robbing the church to thatch the choir.</Q> But if you have a common or open field near, be doing with all my heart, and rob on, for &s;omebody will be doing it for you if you do it not. However, if the common, open field, &amp;c. be at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, you perhaps lo&s;e as much as you gain; for, march|ing &s;heep to and from their pa&s;ture &s;everal miles every day, mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily hurt them much; and if this is to be the ca&s;e, I &s;uppo&s;e the deer-like thin &s;heep may be the be&s;t for this purpo&s;e, as being probably better able to bear the fatigue of travelling day by day. Neverthele&s;s, the polled long-wool'd &s;heep are employed on this &s;ervice in different parts of this i&s;land.</P>
<P>The &s;heep-breeders upon the York|&s;hire Wolds, fold the&s;e kind of &s;heep
<PB N="137" REF="148">on their fallows, in many places, from Ladyday to Michaelmas. Likewi&s;e, a particular friend of mine, Mr Ben|jamin Sayle of Wentbridge near Don|ca&s;ter, folds his ewe-flock upon both gra&s;s and fallow, and travels them about three miles a-day:&mdash;and few people I believe have &s;hewn fatter &s;heep than he has; his ewes when fatted after having been folded while a breeding flock, as well as the de|&s;cendents of the&s;e ewes. It is no un|common thing for Mr Sayle to &s;ell his fat ewes in the latter end of May and in June, in Wakefield market, from thirty-&s;ix to forty &s;hillings a|piece, without the wool: and I hope he will excu&s;e me, when I &s;ay that this &s;ame &s;pirited breeder has given Mr Bakewell as high as fifty guineas for the u&s;e of a ram for one &s;ea&s;on only.</P>
<P>I &s;hould not have taken the liberty of &s;aying &s;o much of this re&s;pectable
<PB N="138" REF="149">breeder, and his valuable &s;heep; but becau&s;e I do <HI>think</HI> he has more merit than any other &s;heep-breeder I know of, on account of breeding the mo&s;t valuable &s;heep in proportion to the land they are bred upon: For every|body that knows Wenthill will admit that there are very few wor&s;e &s;heep-walks in England, where polled &s;heep are kept; and tho&s;e that know it not, will, I am per&s;uaded, find it &s;o on enquiring. In my own opinion, the merit of the Di&s;hley or Mr Bakewell's breed, has not in many places been more fully proved than under the ma|nagement of Mr Sayle. It is true that they have been mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sfully tried in much colder &s;ituations, and &s;ome hundreds of miles further north, but in no place I know of where the &s;um|mer pa&s;ture is of &s;o bad a kind of herbage.</P>
<P>In &s;peaking of the importance of improving the breed of the&s;e animals
<PB N="139" REF="150">we have been treating of, &s;ome of my friends, in the warmth of their hearts, have been led to &s;ay, that if tho&s;e animals were improved every|where in this i&s;land to &s;uch a pitch as we find them (I am &s;orry to &s;ay) in a few hands only, and every corner of the cultivable parts of this i&s;land managed in the &s;ame &s;pirited garden-like manner that we meet with in &s;ome &s;mall di&s;tricts here and there, Great Britain would be made capable of &s;up|porting three times the number of in|habitants as at pre&s;ent. But, without being too &s;anguine, &s;uppo&s;e we could &s;upport only twice as many more, if in&s;tead of ten we could maintain twenty millions of people, only think what an amazing affair it would be! and that this might be done in time there can be but little doubt, very little doubt indeed.</P>
<P>If to the mo&s;t &s;pirited cultivation of the ground, and mo&s;t approved
<PB N="140" REF="151">methods of breeding the animals we have been recommending, equal at|tention was paid to floating, flooding, or watering of gra&s;s-grounds in every part of this i&s;land, wherever the &s;i|tuation will admit, perhaps I &s;hall not advance too much if I &s;ay that there are very few parts of this i&s;land but may in &s;ome degree be benefited by this mo&s;t u&s;eful, though I am a|fraid hitherto little under&s;tood im|provement, e&s;pecially in the north parts of this kingdom: And many parts might have water conveyed over them, on a very exten&s;ive &s;cale, and to very great advantage; for, every little brook or rivulet is capable of being thrown over the adjoining grounds more or le&s;s in proportion to their de&s;cent; the more de&s;cent, the more land you can overflow.</P>
<P>This matter will perhaps appear of greater magnitude than people in ge|neral
<PB N="141" REF="152">are aware of, the more it is exa|mined; for I apprehend it may be &s;aid to lay the foundation of mo&s;t improve|ments in agriculture, and to be the <HI>main &s;pring</HI> to all the re&s;t: becau&s;e, if manure is accounted the <HI>primum mobile</HI> in hu&s;bandry, (and few people I be|lieve will deny the truth of the ob&s;er|vation), I apprehend it will be found that this &s;ame watering of the ground is, and may be made the &s;ource of more valuable manure than any-thing el&s;e I know of. But what renders it &s;till more ine&s;timable is, that it draws this manure from materials which without this proce&s;s would be entirely lo&s;t, or next to it; becau&s;e tho&s;e riches that are productive of &s;uch a&s;toni&s;hing effects as the turning water over land has, are conveyed unob&s;erved down tho&s;e &s;treams to the &s;ea, and con&s;e|quently lo&s;t in that va&s;t collection of waters. Now, the watering of land
<PB N="142" REF="153">in a proper manner, not only rai&s;es an amazing crop of hay, but &s;pring-eatage and lattermath, edi&s;hes, fog, or foggages, as they are differently called in different parts of this i&s;land. This hay again properly con&s;umed, makes a large annual return in dung or manure, which you can employ to great advantage on &s;uch parts of your farm as mo&s;t need it; becau&s;e your watered meadow requires no other help but repeating the &s;ame proce&s;s as often as nece&s;&s;ary, while it repays your expence and toil in the mo&s;t grateful manner, by plentiful and certain crops of hay year after year, and, in&s;tead of exhau&s;ting, becomes richer, or more productive.</P>
<P>I am well informed, that upon the watered meadows in Somer&s;et&s;hire, they calculate twenty &s;hillings <HI>per</HI> acre upon the &s;pring-catage; then grow a ton and a half or two tons
<PB N="143" REF="154">of hay upon each acre, be&s;ide the lattermath or after-eatage. The way they reckon is this: An acre will keep eight ewes and lambs, which, at &s;ix|pence <HI>per</HI> week each couple, is four &s;hillings: they eat it five weeks before laying it in for meadow, which makes the twenty &s;hillings a decent return; this exclu&s;ive of all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>But in many of the &s;outhern and &s;outh-we&s;tern counties, they employ water upon their lands to as much advantage as in Somer&s;et&s;hire.&mdash; At Di&s;hley, Mr Bakewell has im|proved a con&s;iderable tract of poor cold land, beyond any-thing I ever &s;aw, or could have conceived, by this &s;ame mode of improvement;&mdash; and, ever ready to communicate his knowledge to the Public, he has left proof-pieces in different parts of his meadows, in order to convince people of the great importance and utility of
<PB N="144" REF="155">this kind of improvement:&mdash;Particu|larly, in one part he has been at the pains to divide a rood of ground in|to twenty equal divi&s;ions, <HI>viz.</HI> two perches in each piece. It is &s;o con|trived that they can water the fir&s;t, and leave the &s;econd unwatered; or mi&s;s the fir&s;t, and water the &s;econd; and &s;o on through all the 20 divi&s;ions: by which contrivance, you have the faire&s;t and mo&s;t unequivocal proofs of the good effect of improving ground by watering. And as Mr Bakewell is &s;o kind as &s;hew this experimental part to any Gentleman, I cannot help thinking it well worth the while of the curious, and tho&s;e that have lei&s;ure, to vi&s;it this extraordinary place, where they will &s;ee many things worthy their attention and in&s;pection be&s;ide water|ing meadows. And tho&s;e that wi&s;h to know the art of watering land with|out going to &s;ee it, will do well to
<PB N="145" REF="156">read Mr George Bo&s;well's Treati&s;e on watering meadows, low lands, &amp;c. where they will &s;ee that matter ex|plained in a very &s;atisfactory manner.</P>
<P>It is totally out of my way to meddle with political matters; but I hope I &s;hall not advance too much when I &s;ay that it would perhaps turn to much better account, if in&s;tead of planting colonies, and conquering provinces, our Great Folks would turn their attention not only to the improvement of our Fi&s;heries, but in promoting the cultivation of every acre of cultivable land in the&s;e king|doms, as well as the improvement of the mo&s;t valuable breeds of animals. And in order to promote this matter to its greate&s;t extent, it would be pro|per to have experimental farms in one or more parts of the&s;e i&s;lands, at the expence of Government, with proper &s;uperintendants, and &s;ervants under
<PB N="146" REF="157">them, to make every con&s;i&s;tent trial in the various walks of cultivation, &s;o as to a&s;certain which are the be&s;t modes; as well as a breeding farm or farms, under proper regulations, &s;o as to a&s;certain, by proper trials and com|pari&s;ons, which are the mo&s;t valuable animals, and be&s;t worth attending to by our farmers and breeders in their different &s;ituations, in every part of the&s;e i&s;lands; becau&s;e if we put the lands in this i&s;land into four divi&s;ions, <HI>viz.</HI> from nothing to five &s;hillings <HI>per</HI> acre, from five to ten &s;hillings, from ten to fifteen, and from fifteen to twenty, &s;uppo&s;ing whatever is above the la&s;t rent to be adapted rather to grazing than breeding and cultivation: This being the &s;uppo&s;ed ca&s;e, we can only have occa&s;ion for four different &s;pecies of neat cattle and &s;heep.&mdash;But &s;ome may naturally enough &s;ay, that there are variety of &s;oils, &s;uch as clay
<PB N="147" REF="158">and &s;and, &amp;c. We will &s;ay, that they will require five or &s;ix different &s;pecies of &s;tock: but if I was to hazard a con|jecture, I &s;hould incline to think that it will be found upon trial even fewer &s;till will do. But whoever is acquaint|ed with, or has attended to the varie|ties of &s;tock in this i&s;land, will find, (I will venture to &s;ay) in&s;tead of five or &s;ix &s;pecies of neat cattle or &s;heep, five or &s;ix and twenty variations or more of both kinds. Neverthele&s;s I dare &s;ay my intelligent Readers will admit, that the &s;ame kinds of &s;tock which will do upon the mountainous and high parts of Scotland, will al&s;o do upon the mountainous and high parts of Wales and England. Like|wi&s;e, tho&s;e &s;orts which &s;uit the lower hills of Scotland and the north of England, will al&s;o &s;uit in Wales; and I &s;hould imagine on the York&s;hire and Lincoln&s;hire Wolds, as well as
<PB N="148" REF="159">the Downs on the South of England: For, I apprehend, downs and wolds are only different names for the &s;ame kind of ri&s;ing grounds: And &s;urely tho&s;e &s;orts of &s;tock which will an&s;wer the end be&s;t in the low-lands, plains, or campaign parts in one quarter of the i&s;land, will al&s;o an&s;wer the end be&s;t in tho&s;e parts in every other quarter.&mdash;If this train of rea&s;oning be ju&s;t, it would &s;eem as though we &s;hall only have occa&s;ion for a very few va|riations of &s;tock: and what the&s;e va|riations &s;hould be, I apprehend atten|tion and application, joined to a few years experience, will alone di&s;cover<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Since the above was printed, I find that I have been in a mi&s;take with regard to the opinion attributed to Dr Ander&s;on above (page 102) con|cerning Sheep, which I embrace the fir&s;t opportu|nity of correcting.&mdash;I now under&s;tand, that that Gentleman believes that the native &s;heep of the Scotti&s;h I&s;lands and Northern Di&s;tricts of Scotland are a di&s;tinct breed, in many re&s;pects different from the &s;heep of Spain; and in particular, that the wool of the&s;e &s;heep is much more remarkable for a pecu|liar &s;ilky &s;oftne&s;s, than that of Spain, or any other wool found in Europe that he has had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve.

They are in general redi&s;h-brown, with black &s;pots upon them, large ears hanging over their eyes, &s;hort-legged, &s;mall-boned, and exceedingly inclined to make readily fat. The &s;urpri&s;ing weight that &s;ome of the&s;e hogs have been fed to, would be altogether incredible if we had it not &s;o well atte&s;ted.&mdash;Mr Young, in one of his Tours, gives an account of one in Berk&s;hire, which

<P>There was a breed of large white pigs, with very large cars hanging over their eyes, which a few years ago

They were very plain thin aukward hogs, with very long legs; but what di&s;tingui&s;hed them more, was two wattles or dugs not unlike the teats of a cow's udder, which hung down from their throats one on each &s;ide. But this unprofit|able kind have now almo&s;t every-where given place to the more valuable breed which we have ju&s;t been &s;peaking of, and which, like Aaron's rod, bids fair to &s;wallow up all the re&s;t. Indeed the Chine&s;e or black breed will always be valuable, e&s;pecially for roa&s;ting pigs and porkets; and though they do not feed to any great weight, yet they fatten amazingly fa&s;t, and afford the &s;weete&s;t bacon, which has gained the preference every-where among&s;t the nice-eating people. Indeed tho&s;e that have not been accu&s;tomed to the very fat bacon in the &s;outhern and midland
<PB N="153" REF="164">counties, the very &s;ight of it is enough to a per&s;on with a very delicate &s;to|mach, who cannot behold the very fat part of it without almo&s;t &s;icken|ing, while the people in tho&s;e coun|ties eat it all times of the day: I have frequently &s;een them breakfa&s;t upon it.</P>
<P>The black breed are de&s;ervedly in great e&s;teem, and would be much more &s;o if they were not &s;uch a mi&s;chievous race: for, the mo&s;t attentive herding (or tenting as they call it in &s;ome parts of the South) can &s;carcely keep them from your fields of corn, pea&s;e, or po|tatoes; nothing will &s;ecure them, ex|cept walls or good paling.</P>
<P>I know of only one other breed of pigs in the&s;e i&s;lands that I have ob|&s;erved, and the&s;e are the Highland or Iri&s;h breed, a kind no otherwi&s;e worth naming but for di&s;tinction's &s;ake; for I am per&s;uaded whoever is acquainted with the Berk&s;hire or black breeds,
<PB N="154" REF="165">will never throw tho&s;e a&s;ide for the&s;e: They are a &s;mall thin-formed animal, with bri&s;tles &s;tanding up from no&s;e to tail, and exceeding bad thrivers. We met with con&s;iderable herds of them upon the muirs in different parts of the Highlands of Scotland, picking up the wild berries, e&s;pecially about Thur&s;o in Caithne&s;s.</P>
<P>I have &s;een the &s;ame kind of pigs in different parts of Ireland. It is a little extraordinary that the people of that very fine fertile i&s;land, &s;hould not have hitherto paid more attention to the breeding of &s;tock.&mdash;I have ju&s;t men|tioned their pigs: their cattle I took &s;ome notice of before; therefore &s;hall beg leave to add a few words in this place in regard to their &s;heep, a pretty large &s;ample of which I &s;aw at the great fair of Ballina&s;loe, where the col|lector of the tolls told me that there were 95,000 &s;hewn at that time, and
<PB N="155" REF="166">that there had often been more. But I am &s;orry to &s;ay, that I never &s;aw &s;uch ill-formed ugly &s;heep as the&s;e: the wor&s;t breeds we have in Great Bri|tain are by much &s;uperior. One would almo&s;t imagine that the &s;heep-breeders in Ireland have taken as much pains to breed plain aukward &s;heep, as many of the people in England have to breed hand&s;ome ones. I know nothing to recommend them except their &s;ize, which might plea&s;e &s;ome old-fa&s;hion|ed breeders who can get no kind of &s;tock large enough. But I will en|deavour to de&s;cribe them, and leave my Readers to judge for them&s;elves. &mdash;The&s;e &s;heep are &s;upported by very long, thick, crooked grey legs; their heads long and ugly, with large flag|ing ears, grey faces, and eyes &s;unk; necks long, and &s;et on below the &s;houlders; brea&s;ts narrow and &s;hort, hollow before and behind the &s;houl|ders;
<PB N="156" REF="167">flat-&s;ided, with high narrow herring-backs; hind-quarters droop|ing, and tail &s;et low. In &s;hort, they are almo&s;t in every re&s;pect contrary to what I apprehend a well-formed &s;heep &s;hould be; and it is to be lamented that more attention has not been paid to the breeding of u&s;eful &s;tock in an i&s;land &s;o fruitful in pa&s;turage as Ire|land. Indeed the &s;ame Mr Frenches mentioned before, and &s;ome other &s;pi|rited breeders, have, at very great ex|pence and hazard, imported both bulls, tupes, and &s;tone-hor&s;es from England; and very great improvements have al|ready been made from the&s;e cro&s;&s;es. I &s;aw &s;ome of the de&s;cendents of the&s;e &s;heep from the Engli&s;h rams at the a|bove fair; and it is both extraordinary and plea&s;ing to &s;ee how much they exceeded the native breed. But a very great bar is put in the way of the&s;e i&s;landers in the improvement of their
<PB N="157" REF="168">&s;heep: The &s;ame law is in full force again&s;t exporting &s;heep into Ireland, as though they were to &s;end them to our natural enemies on the Continent. I think it is a real hard&s;hip that this divi&s;ion of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects can|not have the benefit of improving their breed of &s;heep, without &s;muggl|ing them over. Application was made to Lord Harcourt when Lord-Licu|tenant of Ireland, for leave to &s;end rams over to Ireland from England, offering very high &s;ecurity, three or four times the value of the ram, for his being returned into England, or, in ca&s;e of death, a proper certificate to be produced along with his &s;kin, ear-marks, &amp;c. but without effect.&mdash; However, to &s;how that the fault is not in the Iri&s;h breeders; but, on the contrary, to prove that they are ex|ceedingly de&s;irous to improve their breeds of &s;tock by the help of tho&s;e
<PB N="158" REF="169">from this i&s;land, even at an expence that many of our breeders in Great Britain would grumble at, I will lay before my Readers an authentic ac|count of a &s;tone-colt and &s;ome &s;heep &s;old at Ballina&s;loe-fair in the county of Galway in Ireland, which was given by Mr French, a gentleman of fortune and character who lives in the neighbourhood of Ballina&s;loe, to a particular friend of mine, who was &s;o kind as to pre&s;ent it to me. They were &s;old by auction in &s;mall lots, the 5th of October 1770.</P>

<P>Since Mr French gave the above ac|count to the Gentleman from whom I had it, I have had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing him in Ireland. I al&s;o met with Mr John&s;on, brother to the per&s;on who &s;old the above goods, who gave me the &s;ame relation of this affair as Mr French did.</P>
<P>HAVING now, to the be&s;t of my knowledge, and according to what I propo&s;ed, given an account of tho&s;e dome&s;tic animals, in the breeding of which our farmers are &s;o deeply in|tere&s;ted in particular, as well as the kingdom at large, I will beg leave to add a few general remarks before I proceed farther.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="171">In the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place, then, it would &s;eem that the large&s;t dome&s;tic animals are not the be&s;t or mo&s;t advantageous to the breeder and feeder: becau&s;e we generally find, that the large big-boned cattle and &s;heep require more and better food in proportion to &s;up|port and feed them, than tho&s;e of a middling &s;ize and &s;mall bones; and the larger, bigger boned, and clum&s;ier they are formed, the more unprofit|able they are; while on the contrary, the truer they are formed, and the finer the bone, the more profitable, as they not only take le&s;s food in pro|portion, but feed readier. The beef or mutton is finer-grained, and &s;ells higher by the pound: it is worth more to the con&s;umer than the other, be|cau&s;e it affords more and better fle&s;h, and le&s;s bone. Nay, and &s;uppo&s;ing the poor are under a nece&s;&s;ity of buy|ing the coar&s;e parts in a dear time,
<PB N="161" REF="172">it is worth more to them in propor|tion than the coar&s;e of the large-boned ones; becau&s;e, tho' &s;till coar&s;e, it is finer than the others, and has le&s;s bone: in fact it is the cheape&s;t and be&s;t eating to the rich, to the ma|nufacturer, and to the poor.</P>
<P>Even in regard to hor&s;es intended for the draught or &s;addle, tho&s;e I pre|&s;ume are the be&s;t in general that are of the true&s;t proportion in re&s;pect to bone, carca&s;e, or form, and of a <HI>middling</HI> &s;ize. It may be admitted, that the great aukward lumbering hor&s;es, from 16 hands to 18, may be the propere&s;t for drays or &s;tage-wag|gons, &amp;c. But we know that &s;ize is unfit for the &s;addle, the cart, or the plough; and where one is wanted for the former purpo&s;es, I &s;uppo&s;e five are wanted for the latter: perhaps from 14 to 16 hands are the mo&s;t &s;ervice|able, or, to come nearer, I fancy we
<PB N="162" REF="173">&s;hall find the be&s;t from 14 hands 2 inches to 15 hands 2 inches; but perhaps it is not very ea&s;y to a&s;cer|tain this to any great degree of exact|ne&s;s, nor may it be ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary.</P>
<P>However, this I think we may ven|ture to a&s;&s;ert, that in tho&s;e kinds of animals now under our con&s;ideration, and perhaps in mo&s;t others, there is a certain &s;ymmetry or proportion of parts which are be&s;t adapted to a par|ticular &s;ize in each kind. All tho&s;e of each kind that are above this pitch or &s;ize, we find di&s;proportioned ac|cording to the &s;ize they attain to; and in the degree that they are advanced beyond this line of perfection, we find them le&s;s active, le&s;s &s;trong in pro|portion, and always le&s;s able to en|dure hard&s;hip or fatigue. We find all great hor&s;es tire &s;ooner than middling-&s;ized ones: they are &s;lower in motion;
<PB N="163" REF="174">they are more &s;ubject to di&s;orders or complaints, and con&s;equently wear &s;ooner out.</P>
<P>In cattle or &s;heep we in general find the large&s;t the tendere&s;t, mo&s;t liable to complaints, require more and nicer fare, are &s;lower in feeding, and wor&s;e butcher-meat when fed: they &s;tand winters or inclement &s;ea&s;ons much wor&s;e than the well-proportioned ones. It is the&s;e well-proportioned hand&s;ome animals that we would recommend to the attention of the breeders to choo&s;e both males and females from if po&s;&s;i|ble, or as near to them as may be. It perhaps has been owing to the idea of largene&s;s, or the wi&s;h to breed the bigge&s;t in the different kinds of our dome&s;tic animals, that has &s;o long prevented our breeders from &s;electing and di&s;tingui&s;hing the mo&s;t valuable kinds. For, &s;o univer&s;al was this idea, and &s;o much were we blinded by it,
<PB N="164" REF="175">that we did not perceive which were the mo&s;t valuable animals of each kind. We had no conception of any animal being valuable or good that was not great. We could not &s;eparate tho&s;e two ideas of good and great. We did not attend to that &s;ymmetry and pro|portion which &s;o e&s;&s;entially character|i&s;e the valuable kinds of each &s;pecies, and which &s;eldom or never fail of be|ing the hardie&s;t, be&s;t able to bear fa|tigue, and the be&s;t thrivers. In &s;hort, it was left to this age to make tho&s;e nicer di&s;tinctions which con&s;titute the able breeder and di&s;cerning judge; which, the more they are attended to and examined, the more they will be pur&s;ued; and in con&s;equence of which improved notions, our breeders mu&s;t now nece&s;&s;arily follow tho&s;e kinds that are mo&s;t valuable.</P>
<P>Much has been &s;aid of late years about &s;hort-legged &s;tock being the
<PB N="165" REF="176">be&s;t, particularly cattle and &s;heep: nothing would go down once but &s;hort legs. That little &s;hort-legged dwarfi&s;h breed of &s;heep &s;o much (tho' unde&s;ervedly) run upon a few years ago, are very properly called by a con|&s;iderable breeder, an acquaintance of mine, "the Gentlemen's &s;heep;" for, though to tho&s;e who are not judges they have a pretty enough appearance, they will not bear examining by an attentive and able judge, I mean he who judges by his fingers as well as his eyes;&mdash;a method that is out of the Gentleman's line. The&s;e origi|nated in Lincoln&s;hire, but are now almo&s;t entirely di&s;u&s;ed for very good rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>I would wi&s;h to be cautious in con|tradicting a general notion or re|ceived prevailing opinion: But we &s;ometimes find the mo&s;t prevailing opinions wrong. For in&s;tance, what
<PB N="166" REF="177">we have ju&s;t been ob&s;erving of the large&s;t and bigge&s;t-boned animals not being the be&s;t, tho' formerly thought &s;o, and re&s;pecting &s;hort legs: tho' I ad|mit the propriety in a degree, I would wi&s;h to caution our breeders again&s;t the extreme. I would have them re|collect the old proverb, that all ex|tremes are wrong; and I would beg leave to ob&s;erve, that the attentive breeders of this day have, I appre|hend, made &s;ome notable and &s;en&s;ible di&s;tinctions in regard to the&s;e animals that mu&s;t be fed and &s;laughtered for the u&s;e of mankind, <HI>viz.</HI> between what they call e&s;&s;entials and non-e&s;&s;entials. They give the former title to the back and &s;ides in particular, as well as the whole proportion of the carca&s;e, always taking in the inclina|tion to make fat. The non-e&s;&s;entials are the legs, ears, horns, tail, &amp;c. and even wool and hides; for, tho' the&s;e
<PB N="167" REF="178">are valuable in them&s;elves, yet they are more to be di&s;pen&s;ed with than the back, &s;ides, &amp;c.: For, tho&s;e breed|ers and graziers who keep their minds open to conviction, and rea&s;on coolly, &s;ay that they have &s;een good carca&s;es with thick or thin hides, under long, &s;hort, coar&s;e and fine wool, with long, &s;hort, thick or thin horns or ears, &amp;c.; but that they never &s;aw a good car|ca&s;e without the back broad and &s;ides round, or without that proportion or &s;ymmetry in the carca&s;e which we have endeavoured to point out in our de&s;criptions of the bull and ram. Neverthele&s;s I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that tho' they have given tho&s;e externals the denomination of non-e&s;&s;entials for di|&s;tinction's &s;ake, they are not to be quite di&s;regarded; becau&s;e, notwith&s;tand|ing they are not &s;o e&s;&s;ential, yet they are very often &s;trong marks and indi|cations of good or bad thrivers, &amp;c. As for in&s;tance, a thick hide &s;eldom
<PB N="168" REF="179">covers a quick-feeding carca&s;e, or a heavy fleece a ready-feeding or fine-grained ca&s;e of mutton.&mdash;Again, fine &s;mall and &s;traight bones in the legs are almo&s;t certain &s;igns of a kindly breed, and fine-grained beef or mut|ton, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Thus we find the thick pelts and heavy wool in Lincoln&s;hire, cover the coar&s;e&s;t-grained mutton that we know of; while a variation of the &s;ame breed in Leice&s;ter&s;hire, highly improved, have con&s;iderably le&s;s wool, and very thin pelts, are quicker feed|ers, and mutton as fine-grained and &s;weet as a mountain &s;heep.</P>
<P>Tho' it may &s;eem very extraordi|nary to the uncurious and unob&s;erv|ing, yet it is a fact well known to the attentive breeder, that in general all our be&s;t and mo&s;t valuable kinds of &s;tock in England, are found upon the middling and wor&s;t grounds, and not upon the be&s;t lands, as we &s;hould na|turally imagine: And the rea&s;ons why
<PB N="169" REF="180">it is &s;o, are &s;imple and obvious&mdash;Tho&s;e of the middling and indifferent tracts of country, are under the nece&s;&s;ity of producing an indu&s;trious and thriv|ing breed of animals: becau&s;e a large tender big-boned kind could not &s;ub|&s;i&s;t upon their keeping, or the pro|duce rai&s;ed upon &s;uch lands; while the good land makes up for every deficiency, or at lea&s;t &s;o far blinds the imagination of the unthinking breeder, that he plumes him&s;elf upon having &s;tock &s;uperior to his indu&s;tri|ous neighbours, while the merit con|&s;i&s;ts in the goodne&s;s of his land, and the richne&s;s of his pa&s;turage and pro|duce. Satisfied with his &s;tock being the large&s;t, he al&s;o concludes that they are the be&s;t; while his more ac|tive and indu&s;trious neighbour, from being &s;ituated in a le&s;s fertile &s;oil, is obliged to &s;eek out for a hardy thriv|ing breed.&mdash;And this again makes me recur to the Lincoln&s;hire breeders,
<PB N="170" REF="181">who have &s;o long &s;tuck to &s;uch coar&s;e unprofitable kinds of &s;tock, both cattle and &s;heep, the pa&s;turage in a great part of that county exceeding any other I am acquainted with in this i&s;land: For, what other county have we, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of ground that will thro' &s;ummer &s;ufficiently &s;upport &s;ix, eight, and even ten large &s;heep from 18 to 24 lib. a quarter, upon an acre, or one ox and five large &s;heep?&mdash;Nay I was told by &s;ome Lincoln&s;hire farmers, when dining with them at Lowth, that near to Bo&s;ton (a place I never did vi&s;it) there are &s;ome grounds which maintain 15 or 16 &s;heep upon an acre all the &s;ummer<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Since the above was written, the Author has vi&s;ited that rich part of Lincoln&s;hire above re|ferred to, and found that the common mode of &s;tocking the pa&s;tures in that fertile di&s;trict is &s;even &s;heep and half-a-bea&s;t <HI>per</HI> acre; that is, in other words, fourteen &s;heep and one bea&s;t on two acres thro' &s;ummer, and five &s;heep on two acres during winter.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>I al&s;o know very little concerning deer:&mdash;But I &s;uppo&s;e that the different &s;pecies of the&s;e animals might be great|ly improved, by the &s;imple and plain rule of &s;electing the be&s;t males and be&s;t females, and breeding from the&s;e in preference to the promi&s;cuous me|thods which at pre&s;ent I am told are too much pur&s;ued: And I can have little doubt but that the be&s;t veni&s;on (as well as the be&s;t mutton, &amp;c.) will always be found in the true&s;t form, and along with the &s;malle&s;t and fine&s;t bone; and if &s;o, how ea&s;y would it be for a Nobleman or Gentleman to order his game-keeper to choo&s;e out a few of the be&s;t males and females prior to the rutting &s;ea&s;on, put them into a fenced place by them&s;elves, give the young ones a particular mark to know them from the promi&s;cuous race! and
<PB N="177" REF="188">a few years will determine whether this matter be worthy of the attention recommended. I know great &s;tre&s;s is laid upon the pa&s;turage or herbage they feed upon, nor will I deny its effects in a degree; yet I apprehend a right choice of the mo&s;t valuable males and females of any kind what&s;oever, properly attended to, bred from, and the produce depa&s;tured along with the promi&s;cuous breed, will &s;hew a much more con&s;picuous effect.</P>

<P>OF the feathered tribe I acknow|ledge my&s;elf more ignorant than even of the quadrupeds I have been la&s;t treating. However, if I am rightly informed by people of nice palates, the &s;mall-boned well-proportioned poultry, greatly excel the large-boned big kind, in ta&s;te, finene&s;s of fle&s;h, and flavour; and if this be the ca&s;e, it

<HEAD>ADDENDUM.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">What follows &s;hould have been in&s;erted under the article Cattle, but was then overlooked.</HEAD>
<P>I APPREHEND one great mi&s;take that breeders in general have run in|to, e&s;pecially in breeding neat cattle, has been in endeavouring to unite great-milkers with quick-feeders. I am inclined to think this cannot be done; for, wherever we attempt both, we are &s;ure to get neither in any per|fection. In proportion as we gain the one, in the &s;ame proportion we lo&s;e the other: the more milk, the le&s;s beef; and the more we pur&s;ue beef, the le&s;s milk we get. In truth they &s;eem to me to be as it were two different &s;pecies or &s;orts of cattle of the &s;ame kind, for very different u&s;es; and if &s;o, they ought mo&s;t certainly to be
<PB N="180" REF="191">differently pur&s;ued by tho&s;e that em|ploy them. If the dairy-man wants milk, let him pur&s;ue the milking-tribe; let him have both bull and cows of the be&s;t and greate&s;t milking-family he can find. On the contrary, he that wants feeding or grazing cattle, let him procure a bull and cows of that &s;ort which feed the quicke&s;t, wherever they are to be found. By pur&s;uing too many ob|jects at once, we are apt to lo&s;e &s;ight of the principal; and by aiming at too much, we often lo&s;e all. Let us only keep to di&s;tinct &s;orts, and we will obtain the prize in due time. I apprehend it has been much owing to the mixing of breeds, and improper cro&s;&s;ings, that has kept us &s;o long from di&s;tingui&s;hing the mo&s;t valuable kinds:&mdash;And if it had not been for Mr Bakewell, perhaps we might &s;till have been groping in the dark; at
<PB N="181" REF="192">lea&s;t, that great breeder was the fir&s;t I know of who pointed out the valu|able &s;orts, made tho&s;e true di&s;tinctions unob&s;erved I believe before this day, and has pur&s;ued them with a zeal, judgment, and per&s;everance peculiar to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I do not &s;uppo&s;e this doctrine to be &s;o new as it has been unattended to, and not properly con&s;idered; for, I have heard many a man &s;ay, <Q>How &s;hould that cow be a good milker? &s;he runs too much to fle&s;h;</Q> and &s;o it is, while all the great milkers are invariably thin. The former are ge|nerally high-&s;ided, light bellied, co|vered in all their points; and in &s;hort, in proportion as they recede from the great milking-tribe, <HI>fat com|pared,</HI> though kept on middling fare: while the latter will be lean upon their backs, flat-&s;ided, low-bellied, poor and ill-looking, though much better kept than the others.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="193">I own there is a middling kind of cows which give a tolerable quantity of milk, and al&s;o keep in pretty good condition or order; but this I appre|hend does not all militate again&s;t the above rea&s;oning, becau&s;e &s;till tho&s;e that incline the mo&s;t to fle&s;h, invari|ably give the lea&s;t milk, and <HI>vice ver&s;a:</HI> And tho' many of the middling cows will make very fat when they are dried, or the milk taken from them, yet not near &s;o quickly fat, nor &s;o ripe, as tho&s;e which give le&s;s milk, and are inclined more to fat while in a milking &s;tate.</P>

<HEAD><HI>No. I.</HI> AN Account of the Names of Dome&s;tic Animals at different ages.</HEAD>
<P>THE general name by which the male &s;heep are known, is Ram or Tupe. When lambs, they are called ram or tupe-lambs as long as they &s;uck. From weaning, or taking from the ewes, to the &s;hearing or clipping for the fir&s;t time, they are called hogs, hogerels, or lamb-hogs. Then they take the name of &s;hearing, &s;hearling, &s;hearhog, or dinmond tupes or rams. After that, according to the years they are clipped or &s;horn, they are called two-&s;hear, three-&s;hear, and &s;o on, which always takes place from the time of
<PB N="184" REF="195">&s;hearing<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The age of &s;heep is al&s;o known, or pretended to be known, by the changes on their fore-teeth; I &s;ay pretended, becau&s;e I take upon me to &s;ay that it is a very uncertain way of judging, as I will endeavour to &s;how afterwards.</NOTE>. But when gelt or ca|&s;trated, they are called wedder-lambs while &s;ucking; then wedder-hogs, until &s;horn or clipped, when they take the name of &s;hearings, &amp;c.; until they are &s;horn a &s;econd time, when they are called young wedders, or two-&s;hear-wedders; then three or four-&s;hear-wedders, or more, according to the times they are clipped or &s;horn.</P>
<P>The general name by which the fe|male &s;heep are known, is Ewe: while &s;ucking, they are called ewe-lambs, or gimmer-lambs; but when weaned, or taken from the dams, they are called ewe-hogs or gimmer-hogs, until clip|ped or &s;horn for the fir&s;t time, when they take the name of gimmers, which
<PB N="185" REF="196">name continues only one year, until they lo&s;e their fleeces a &s;econd time, when they obtain the name of ewes, which they retain as long as they live; only, every time they are &s;horn, they add a year to their age, and are called two-&s;hear, three-&s;hear, or four-&s;hear-ewes, according to the times they have been clipped or &s;horn: And this holds good of all other &s;heep; for, the age of &s;heep is not reckoned from the time they are lambed, but from the time of &s;hearing: for, altho' a &s;heep is generally 15 or 16 months old when fir&s;t &s;horn, yet they are not called &s;hearings until once clipped, which is under&s;tood to be the &s;ame as one year old.</P>
<P>What we call gimmers in the North, in many of the midland parts of Eng|land are called thieves, and when twice &s;horn, double thieves. This &s;eems very uncouth and incon&s;i&s;tent to our
<PB N="186" REF="197">ears, but &s;o much for cu&s;tom. There are other variations of names in dif|ferent parts, which I do not recol|lect. In &s;ome places they call the male-lambs heeders, and the females &s;heeders; and in others, two-year-old ewes are called twinters, and three-year-olds thrunters.</P>
<P>THE general name of the male in Neat Cattle, is Bull. During the time he &s;ucks, he is called a bull-calf, until turned of a year old, when he is called a &s;tirk or yearling bull; then a two, three, or four-year-old bull, until &s;ix, when he is aged:&mdash;but when ca|&s;trated or gelt, he is called an ox or &s;tot-calf, until a year old, when he is called a &s;tirk, &s;tot, or yearling; then a two-year-old &s;teer, and in &s;ome places a twinter:&mdash;at three, he is called a three-year-old &s;teer; and at four, he fir&s;t takes the name of ox or bullock,
<PB N="187" REF="198">though formerly I believe the ca|&s;trated male was not called an ox or bullock until &s;ix years old<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I apprehend the taking the name of ox or bul|lock at four in&s;tead of &s;ix years old, has taken place &s;ince the drawing or working of oxen has been &s;o much difu&s;ed.</NOTE>, when he is looked upon to be at the be&s;t, tho' &s;ome people think an ox improves until &s;even, eight, or even nine years old.</P>
<P>The general name of the female of this kind is Cow: while &s;ucking the dam, &s;he is called a cow-calf, quey-calf, or heifer-calf; then yearling quey or heifer; then a two-year-old quey or heifer, or twinter; the next year a three-year-old quey or heifer; and when four, &s;he is fir&s;t called a cow, which name is retained till the la&s;t. If ca&s;trated or &s;payed, &s;he is called a &s;payed or cut heifer, or &s;payed or cut quey in the North parts of the i&s;land.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="199">A Stone-hor&s;e or Stallion is what we di&s;tingui&s;h the male of the hor&s;e-kind by: while &s;ucking, he is a foal or colt-foal, then a yearling colt<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In &s;ome places a colt from one to two years old is called a &s;tag.</NOTE>, afterwards a two and three-year-old colt, until four, when they are mo&s;t common|ly called hor&s;es, which name holds through.</P>
<P>The female of this breed is called a Mare: when &s;ucking, a mare or filley-foal, then a yearling-filley, after|wards a two and three-year-old filley, and at four &s;he becomes a mare.</P>
<P>OF the Pig-tribe the male is called a Boar or Brawn, the female a Sow, the ca&s;trated male a hog-pig, the cut or ca&s;trated female a gilt or gaut.&mdash;Pigs or Swine are common names for the whole tribe.</P>

<HEAD><HI>APPENDIX, No. II.</HI> Of the time the different. Dome&s;tic Ani|mals &s;hed their teeth, and the rules for knowing their age.</HEAD>
<P>NEAT Cattle ca&s;t no teeth until turned two years old, when they get two new teeth; at three they get two more, and in every &s;ucceeding year get two, until five years old, when they are called full-mouthed, though they are not properly full-mouthed until &s;ix years old, becau&s;e the two corner-teeth, which are the la&s;t in renewing, are not perfectly up until they are &s;ix.&mdash;It may al&s;o be worthy of notice, that the fir&s;t wrinkle upon the horn does not take place un|til three years old, after which they get another circle or wrinkle every year as long as the horn &s;tands on, though not always equally di&s;cern|able
<PB N="190" REF="201">in all horned cattle; and I am &s;orry to &s;ay, that it is too common for jobbers and cow-dealers to &s;crape, ra&s;p, or file down the&s;e wrinkles in old cattle, to prevent the age being known, and by that means to deceive and impo&s;e upon the unwary, igno|rant, and un&s;u&s;pecting.</P>
<P>A hor&s;e does not ca&s;t or renew any of his teeth until between two and a-half and three years old, when he ca&s;ts two above and two below<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Neat cattle and &s;heep have no teeth in the upper jaw before, but only in the under jaw, while the hor&s;e tribe has both above and below: indeed the former chew the cud, but the latter does not.</NOTE>. Between three and a-half and four years, he ca&s;ts four more, <HI>(viz.)</HI> two above and two below; and between four and a-half and five years old, he ca&s;ts the remaining four, which are called the corner-teeth. It is remarkable that
<PB N="191" REF="202">the eight fir&s;t teeth which the hor&s;e renews, make all their growth in abour 15 days, while the four la&s;t or corner-teeth take about a year and a-half to make their full growth. The four fir&s;t teeth he renews, are called <HI>nippers</HI> or <HI>gatherers,</HI> the next four are called <HI>&s;eparaters,</HI> and the four la&s;t are the corner-teeth, which al&s;o contain the black mark by which the dealers can &s;o well di&s;lingui&s;h the age of a hor&s;e. And &s;ome may think that I ought to &s;ay &s;omething of this matter here; but tho&s;e that want to be acquainted with this doctrine, need only con&s;ult Bart|let, Brecken, or any of our books upon farriery, where they will find it fully explained.&mdash;Hor&s;es have al&s;o four tu&s;ks or tu&s;hes (as the dealers call them) which &s;tand between the fore-teeth and grinders, and u&s;ually make their appearance when a hor&s;e is about three and a-half years old, but are not
<PB N="192" REF="203">at their full growth until the hor&s;e be &s;ix years old<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The above is taken from the Compleat Hor&s;e|man or Perfect Farrier.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Sheep in general renew their fir&s;t two teeth from 14 to 16 months old, and afterwards every year about the &s;ame time, until they are turned three years old, or rather three &s;hear, to &s;peak technically, when they become full-mouthed; for, though they have eight teeth in the under-jaw before, I believe they only ca&s;t or renew the &s;ix in&s;ide ones. However, this matter is not perfectly clear, becau&s;e I find the &s;hepherds differ in opinion, &s;ome thinking they ca&s;t only &s;ix, others again all the eight fore-teeth.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="observations">
<PB N="193" REF="204">
<HEAD>Ob&s;ervations on the above.</HEAD>
<P>IT may be ob&s;erved, that Sheep re|new their fir&s;t teeth &s;oon after they are pa&s;t one year old, Neat Cattle not until they are pa&s;t two, and Hor&s;es not until they are near three years old. And this is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with the wi&s;dom of the Great Greator in all his works:&mdash;becau&s;e, the hor&s;e-tribe live the longe&s;t, and are evidently meant to bear the greate&s;t hard&s;hips: The bull-tribe the next longe&s;t; and tho' very u&s;eful as a bea&s;t of draught, yet not at all equal to the hor&s;e in firmne&s;s and hardine&s;s: And the in|nocent &s;heep live the &s;horte&s;t time, and increa&s;e the fa&s;te&s;t, not being in|tended as a bea&s;t of burden or draught, but to feed and clothe the lords of the creation.&mdash;I have heard of particular &s;heep living to near 20 years old,&mdash;tho&s;e which the mountain-&s;hepherds
<PB N="194" REF="205">call guide-&s;heep, <HI>viz.</HI> old wedders kept on purpo&s;e to guide and direct the bleeting flocks upon tho&s;e unfrequent|ed wilds.&mdash;I have al&s;o heard of parti|cular bulls living more than 20 years: and I knew a hor&s;e live until 47 years, This hor&s;e had a ball lodged in his neck at the battle of Proud Pre&s;ton in the Rebellion of the year 1715, and the ball was extracted when the hor&s;e died in 1758. This hor&s;e was &s;up|po&s;ed to be four years old in the year 1715, con&s;equently would be 47 in the year 1758.</P>
<P>Now, re&s;pecting the judging of the age of the above animals by the re|newing of their teeth,&mdash;tho' perhaps the be&s;t rule we know of, yet I cannot think it is always to be depended on. However, in &s;heep, I am very certain we are liable to be mi&s;led by it; and I apprehend much depends upon being carly or late lambed, well or ill fed,
<PB N="195" REF="206">and &s;o on. Particularly tupes, I have frequently known to have what we call four broad or renewed teeth, when by the above rule they ought to have had only two.&mdash;A friend of mine, and an eminent breeder, Mr Charge of Clea&s;by, a few years ago, &s;hewed a &s;hearing tupe at Richmond in York|&s;hire, for the premium given by the Agriculture Society there, which had &s;ix broad teeth; in con&s;equence of which, the judges rejected Mr Charge's tupe (tho' confe&s;&s;edly the be&s;t &s;heep), becau&s;e they believed him to be more than a &s;hearing. However, Mr Charge afterwards proved, to the &s;atisfaction of the Gentlemen, that his tupe was no more than a &s;hearing.</P>
