<HEAD>CHAPTER I. An Humble Apology for Authors in general, with &s;ome mode&s;t Hints at their peculiar U&s;efulne&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>I HOPE the candid reader now and then calls to mind how much more nimbly he travels over the&s;e pages than the writer of them did. When our dullne&s;s is complained of, it would be but charity in him to reflect how much pains that &s;ame dullne&s;s has co&s;t us; more, he may be a&s;&s;ured, than our brighter intervals, where we &s;prung nimbly forward with an ea&s;y weight, in&s;tead of toiling like a carrier's hor&s;e, who&s;e &s;low and heavy pace argues the load he draws, and the labour he endures: alas! for us poor Noveli&s;ts, if there was no mercy for dull authors, and our coun|trymen, like the barbarous Libethrians of old, &s;hould take it into their minds to bani&s;h mu&s;ic
<PB N="2" REF="6">
and the mu&s;es out of the land, and murder every Orpheus that did not fiddle to their ta&s;te. They &s;hould con&s;ider, that the man, who makes a book, makes a very pretty piece of furniture; and if they will but con&s;ign us to a quiet &s;tation on a &s;helf, and give us where|withal to cover us in a decent trim, the wor&s;t among&s;t us will &s;erve to fill up the file, and &s;top a gap in the ranks.</P>
<P>'Tis hard indeed to toil, as we &s;ometimes do, to our own lo&s;s and di&s;appointment; to &s;weat in the field of fame, merely to reap a harve&s;t of chaff, and pile up reams of paper for the worm to dine upon. It is a cruel thing to rack our brains for nothing, run our jaded fancies to a &s;tand-&s;till, and then lie down at the conclu&s;ion of our race, a carca&s;e for the critics. And what is our crime all the while? A mere mi&s;take between our readers and our|&s;elves, occa&s;ioned by a &s;mall mi&s;calculation of our capacities and their candour; all which would be avoided, if happily for us they had not the wit to find out our blunders, or, hap|pily for them, had all that good nature for us that we generou&s;ly exerci&s;e towards our&s;elves. If once they could bring their tempers to this charming complacency, they might depend
<PB N="3" REF="7">
upon having books in plenty; authors would multiply like polypu&s;&s;es, and the pre&s;s would be the happie&s;t mother in the kingdom.</P>
<P>How many worthy gentlemen are there in this ble&s;&s;ed i&s;land of our's, who have &s;o much time upon their hands, that they do not know what to do with it? I am aware how large and re&s;pectable a portion of this enlightened na|tion center their delights in the chace, and draw an elegant re&s;ource from the &s;agacity of the hound and the vigour of the hor&s;e; but they cannot always be on the &s;addle; the ele|ments they cannot command; and fro&s;t and &s;now will lock them up within their ca&s;tle walls: there it is po&s;&s;ible that &s;olitude may &s;urpri&s;e them, and di&s;mi&s;s them for a time to the &s;olace of their own lucubrations: now, with all po&s;&s;ible re&s;pect for the&s;e re&s;ources, I &s;hould think it may &s;ometimes be worth their while to make experiment of other people's lucubrations, when they have worn out their own, for tho&s;e mu&s;t be but &s;orry thoughts, which are not better than not thinking at all; and the lea&s;t they can gain by an author is a nap.</P>
<P>The ingenuity of man has invented a thou|&s;and contrivances for innocently di&s;po&s;ing of
<PB N="4" REF="8">
idle time; let us, therefore, who write books, have only the idlers on our &s;ide, in gratitude for the amu&s;ement we give them, and let the re&s;t of the world be as &s;plenetic as they will, we may &s;et their &s;pleen at naught; the majo|rity will be with us.</P>
<P>If a querulous infant is &s;tilled by a rattle, the maker of the rattle has &s;aved &s;omebody's ears from pain and per&s;ecution; grant, there|fore, that a novel is nothing better than a toy for children of a larger growth and more un|ruly age, &s;ociety has &s;ome cau&s;e to thank the writer of it; it may have put an aching head to re&s;t; it may have cheered the debtor in his pri&s;on, or the country &s;quire in a hard fro&s;t. Traders will cry up the commodity they deal in, therefore I do not greatly in&s;i&s;t on the prai&s;es which &s;ome that write books have be|&s;towed on book-writing, but I do ob&s;erve, that great re&s;pect is paid to an author by tho&s;e who cannot read him, wherefore I conclude, tho&s;e who can read, and do not prai&s;e him, are only &s;ilent becau&s;e they want words to expre&s;s their admiration and gratitude; whil&s;t tho&s;e &s;anguine flatterers, who, in the exce&s;s of their re&s;pect for our per&s;ons, cry down our per|formances, give evident proof how much
<PB N="5" REF="9">
higher they had pitched their expectations of what our talents would produce, than our pro|ductions could make good; but though in their zeal for our reputations, they tell us how ill we write, they &s;eldom neglect at the &s;ame time to &s;hew us how we might have written &s;till wor&s;e.</P>
<P>Some over-wi&s;e people have pretended to di&s;cover, that this altercation between author and critic is nothing more than a mere plot and contrivance to play into each others hands, like Mountebank and Zany; but this is over-acted &s;agacity, and an affectation of finding more my&s;teries in the art of author|&s;hip, than really belong to it; for my part, I believe it is a bu&s;ine&s;s of a more &s;imple nature than mo&s;t which can be taken up, and that authors in general require nothing more than pen, ink, and paper to &s;et up with. In ancient times, the trade was in few hands, and the work &s;eems then to have been compo&s;ed with much pains and forethought; materials were collected with great care, and put toge|ther with con&s;ummate accuracy and attention; every part was fitted to its place, poli&s;hed to the heighth, and fini&s;hed to perfection; there were in&s;pectors on the part of the public, men
<PB N="6" REF="10">
of &s;ound judgment, and fully competent to the office, who brought the work to a &s;tand|ard of rule and mea&s;ure, and in&s;i&s;ted upon it, that every whole &s;hould have <HI>a beginning, a middle, and an end.</HI> Under the&s;e &s;trict regula|tions the ancients wrote; but now that prac|tice has made us perfect, and the trade is got into &s;o many hands, the&s;e regulations are done away, and &s;o far from requiring of us a <HI>begin|ning, middle, and end,</HI> it is enough if we can &s;hew a head and a tail; and it is not always that even the&s;e can be made out with any to|lerable preci&s;ion. As our authors write with le&s;s labour, our critics review with le&s;s care, and for every one fault that they mark in our productions, there probably might be found one hundred that they overlook. It is an idle notion, however, to &s;uppo&s;e that therefore they are in league and concert with the authors they revi&s;e; for where could that poor fraternity find a fund to compen&s;ate them for &s;uffering a vocation once &s;o reputable to fall into &s;uch utter di&s;grace under their management, as to be no longer the employ of a gentleman? As for our readers, on whom we never fail to be&s;tow the terms of candid, gentle, courteous, and others of the like &s;oothing ca&s;t, they cer|tainly
<PB N="7" REF="11">
de&s;erve all the fair words we can give them, for it is not to be denied, but that we make occa&s;ionally very great demands upon their candour, gentlene&s;s, and courte&s;y, exer|ci&s;ing them frequently and fully with &s;uch trials as require tho&s;e &s;everal endowments in no &s;mall proportion. The farther I advance therefore in this work, the civiller I will be; and to tho&s;e readers who &s;hall follow me into this third volume, I may with ju&s;tice apply the epithets of patient, per&s;evering, faithful, and &s;o on, with a <HI>cre&s;cendo</HI> in my &s;train, till the piece is concluded.</P>
<P>But are there not al&s;o fa&s;tidious, angry, que|rulential readers? readers with full &s;tomachs, who complain of being &s;urfeited and over|loaded with the &s;tory-telling tra&s;h of our cir|culating libraries? It cannot be altogether denied, but &s;till they are readers: if the load is &s;o heavy upon them as they pretend it is, I will put them in the way of getting rid of it, by reviving the law of the ancient Cecer|taeans, who obliged their arti&s;ts to hawk about their &s;everal wares, carrying them on their backs, till they found purcha&s;ers to ea&s;e them of the burthen. Was this law put in force again&s;t authors, few of us, I doubt, would be
<PB N="8" REF="12">
found able to &s;tand under the weight of our own unpurcha&s;ed works.</P>
<P>But whil&s;t the public is contented with things as they are, where is the wonder if the reform is never made by us till they begin it in them&s;elves? Let their ta&s;te lead the fa&s;hion, and our productions mu&s;t accord to it. Whil&s;t the Cookeries of Hannah Gla&s;s outcirculate the Commentaries of Black&s;tone, authors will be found, who prefer the compilation of re|ceipts to that of records, as the ea&s;ier and more profitable ta&s;k of the two. If puerilities are plea&s;ing, men will write <HI>ut pueris pla|ceant.</HI></P>
<P>When Demo&s;thenes was engaged in the de|fence of a certain citizen of Athens, who was brought to trial upon a charge of a capital nature, neither the importance of the cau&s;e, nor the eloquence of the pleader, could fix the attention of the judges who were &s;itting on the trial: the orator, ob&s;erving their levity, on a &s;udden &s;topt &s;hort in the mid&s;t of his harangue, and addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the court,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Li&s;ten to me,"</Q> he cried, <Q REND="inline">"ye venerable judges, for a few moments, and I will tell you a merry tale:&mdash;A certain young man, hav|ing occa&s;ion to take a journey from this city
<PB N="9" REF="13">
of our's to Megara, hir'd an a&s;s for the job; but being extremely incommoded on the way by a &s;corching &s;un, which &s;mote him with in|tolerable heat at noon, he di&s;mounted from his bea&s;t, and made free to take po&s;t under the &s;hade of his carca&s;e: upon this the a&s;s-owner, who accompanied him, remon&s;trated with great vehemence, contending that his a&s;s was let for the journey &s;imply and preci&s;ely, and that the &s;ervice now required of him was ex|tra-conditional and illegal: the traveller with equal vehemence maintain'd, that he was warranted in the u&s;e he made of him, and that having hir'd the a&s;s in &s;ub&s;tance, he was intit|led to the benefit of his &s;hadow into the bar|gain: the que&s;tion was open to controver&s;y, and the parties went to trial on the ca&s;e."</Q>&mdash;Here Demo&s;thenes cea&s;ed, and taking up his brief, prepared to leave the court: the judges &s;eeing this, called out to him to return and go on with his pleading.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"For &s;hame, ye men of Athens,"</Q> cried the indignant orator, <Q REND="inline">"ye can lend your ears to the &s;tory of an a&s;s, but will not be&s;tow your attention upon a trial that involves the life or death of a fellow-citizen."</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II. Our Hero undergoes a &s;trict Examination by a certain Judge called Con&s;cience.</HEAD>
<P>AS &s;oon as our hero had brought Blachford to con&s;ent to his di&s;intere&s;ted propo&s;al, he took immediate mea&s;ures for &s;ecuring the &s;ucce&s;s of it. To bring the infant and its mother to an interview with the dying peni|tent was his fir&s;t object. The woman, who had the child at nur&s;e, did not live above two miles off, &s;o that a me&s;&s;enger would &s;oon fetch her over: Su&s;an, indeed, was at a great|er di&s;tance, but the day yet &s;erved for bring|ing her from Man&s;tock; and Henry immedi|ately &s;ate down and wrote the following note:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Su&s;an,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A bu&s;ine&s;s, in which you are greatly in|tere&s;ted, requires your pre&s;ence in this place; Mr. Blachford's life is &s;o precarious, that not an hour is to be lo&s;t: I recommend it to you therefore to &s;tate this to your amiable lady, and, with her permi&s;&s;ion, come away
<PB N="11" REF="15">
directly in the chai&s;e, that will attend for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your's &s;incerely, Henry.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Whil&s;t Henry was writing this note, young Tom Weevil, who had got notice of his arri|val, opportunely called upon him, and no &s;oon|er under&s;tood that he wanted a me&s;&s;enger to Man&s;tock hou&s;e, than he zealou&s;ly tendered his &s;ervices for that errand, and by Henry was in&s;tructed to ride to the next market town, which luckily was in the road, and there put him&s;elf into a po&s;t chai&s;e for the purpo&s;e of conveying Su&s;an in the mo&s;t &s;peedy and commodious manner.</P>
<P>This bu&s;ines being thus adju&s;ted, and an|other me&s;&s;enger di&s;patched for the nur&s;e and child, our hero returned to the cottage, and throwing him&s;elf into Ezekiel's wicker chair, enjoyed for &s;ome minutes, in &s;ilent reflection, that heart-felt &s;atisfaction, that only can re&s;ult from &s;elf-approving con&s;cience. As he medi|tated on the &s;acrifice he was now about to make, he felt a momentary gleam of virtuous exul|tation, which tempted him to cry out&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"O Ratcliffe! dear departed friend! thou wou'd'&s;t
<PB N="12" REF="16">
have prais'd me for this deed, and if thy &s;ainted &s;pirit holds communication with me &s;till, I know thou wilt regard it as a pledge of my obedience to thy fatherly in&s;tructions. But what is this I boa&s;t of? Nothing, com|par'd to the &s;everer trial that awaits me, and demands an effort &s;trong indeed, a &s;acrifice from which my heart &s;hrinks back with terror and di&s;may. Oh! be my guardian &s;till; let thy protecting &s;pirit &s;trengthen my feeble na|ture, and in&s;pire me with the re&s;olution to ful|fil the fatal promi&s;e I have made, and pay the forfeit of my folly.&mdash;Married to Fanny Clay|pole!&mdash;All hopes of happine&s;s for ever bla&s;ted to repair her reputation wantonly expos'd.&mdash;Hard terms indeed, and heavy penalty I have exacted from my&s;elf in an unguarded mo|ment; but the word is pa&s;s'd, and I mu&s;t ho|nourably make it good: and fit I &s;hou'd, if that is the atonement &s;he requires; for what but chance prevented the completion of my guilt? The meditation therefore in my in|&s;tance is the act it&s;elf, and I am virtually her debtor to no le&s;s amount than for the lo&s;s of all that can be valuable to a mode&s;t woman. I know the plea that &s;ome wou'd make; her forwardne&s;s, her fondne&s;s, her allurements: if
<PB N="13" REF="17">
this were good in any ca&s;e, it wou'd be &s;o in mine; but the excu&s;e is mean and villainous; that and that only can be my acquittal, which acquits me to my&s;elf; this cannot &s;erve the turn; my con&s;cience never will be quieted by eva&s;ions. 'Tis true the act was fru&s;trated; what then? I was not quite &s;o abandon'd as to &s;in in pre&s;ence of a warning angel: and can I ever lo&s;e the memory of that rebuke, which the offended purity of that angel ju&s;tly be|&s;towed? Oh, I&s;abella! how that frown made my heart &s;ink within me! Never again &s;hall I have confidence to look upon that lovely face, which till that moment ever greeted me with &s;miles. No more &s;hall that &s;weet voice &s;alute my ears like mu&s;ic, as it was won't to do in the &s;till hour of evening, when we walk'd toge|ther: tho&s;e happy hours are never to return again."</Q></P>
<P>Zachary Cawdle now made his appearance, having returned from his vi&s;it to Lady Crow|bery&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I bring you news,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"of our excellent lady, that will plea&s;e you; her di&s;|order &s;eems abated, and I flatter my&s;elf &s;he will gain &s;trength and &s;pirits to carry her through her journey both by land and &s;ea: &s;he &s;ets out to-morrow in the forenoon for Man|&s;tock-hou&s;e,
<PB N="14" REF="18">
where &s;he will repo&s;e her&s;elf for that night. I have her expre&s;s commands to de&s;ire you will not fail to meet her there."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I know not how that can be,"</Q> &s;aid Henry. <Q REND="inline">"She is very anxious it &s;hou'd be, I can a&s;&s;ure you,"</Q> rejoined the Doctor, <Q REND="inline">"and I believe &s;he has very intere&s;ting matters to confer with you upon, for &s;he &s;aid &s;he mu&s;t po&s;itively &s;ee you, as &s;he cou'd not expre&s;s all &s;he had to &s;ay by letter; neither indeed do I hold it fit &s;he &s;hou'd exhau&s;t her&s;elf in writing for any length of time. If it is your bu&s;ine&s;s with Mr. Blach|ford that &s;tands in the way, I hope that may be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed before it will be nece&s;&s;ary for you to &s;et out to-morrow from this place."</Q></P>
<P>Henry a&s;ked if her lady&s;hip had &s;aid any thing on that &s;ubject. <Q REND="inline">"Not much,"</Q> Zachary replied; <Q REND="inline">"&s;he had noticed it but &s;lightly, &s;eem|ing to intimate a doubt whether it was matter of congratulation or not, which I confe&s;s,"</Q> he added, <Q REND="inline">"rather puzzled me to account for, as her lady&s;hip cannot fail to know that our neighbour will, in the vulgar phra&s;e, die fat; and let your expectations be what they may, &s;urely a good fortune in hand is a good thing at all events."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Mo&s;t people are of that opinion,"</Q> &s;aid Henry, <Q REND="inline">"but her lady&s;hip, per|haps,
<PB N="15" REF="19">
may think otherwi&s;e."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Whatever &s;he thinks,"</Q> replied Zachary, <Q REND="inline">"I dare &s;ay &s;he will keep it to her&s;elf, till &s;he meets you, and con|ver&s;es with you at Man&s;tock."</Q></P>
<P>To this our hero made no further an&s;wer, but turned the di&s;cour&s;e, by enquiring after Mrs. Cawdle.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Her health,"</Q> &s;aid the Doc|tor, <Q REND="inline">"is no better, her temper much wor&s;e, and her enthu&s;ia&s;m more extravagant than ever. Blachford's &s;ituation &s;eems to trouble her much; &s;he has liv'd with him as a &s;inner, and wou'd now fain part from him like a &s;aint; but he has refus'd all her tenders, and has given his con&s;cience into Ezekiel's keeping: this mortifies her in a double &s;en&s;e, for &s;he not only meant to &s;end him out of the world in the true faith, but had an eye al&s;o to the good things he has to leave behind him, of which &s;he had no objection to come in for a &s;hare; but, thanks to the fates! all that is otherwi&s;e di&s;pos'd of. As to the &s;tate of her con&s;titu|tion, that is in a rapid decline from bad to wor&s;e, being only held together like a &s;inking ve&s;&s;el by the very elements that &s;ap and under|mine it. When I take my leave of her, as I &s;hall do to-morrow, great chance if our's is not an everla&s;ting farewell."</Q></P>

<P>Henry was not &s;orry to be left to his reflec|tions, for his mind was greatly embarra&s;&s;ed by the me&s;&s;age he had received from Lady Crow|bery. To pre&s;ent him&s;elf once more at Man|&s;tock-hou&s;e was painful in the extreme; to di&s;|obey the commands of a mother on &s;o intere&s;t|ing a &s;ummons was an alternative not to be thought of: how to avoid the one without tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the other was a point of difficulty that now engro&s;&s;ed his thoughts; and as for Zachary's concluding account of Jemima's melancholy condition, from that it is more than probable he had carried off very little, if any, information.</P>
<P>The great evil of all, that &s;unk deepe&s;t into his mind, was his engagement to Mi&s;s Clay|pole, a lady very little to his ta&s;te, and the con&s;equent lo&s;s of all hope that had re&s;pect to I&s;abella, a lady, whom at his heart he mo&s;t ardently admired and loved. The di&s;grace he had incurred with him&s;elf, as well as with her, in that fatal moment of his weakne&s;s, was a cutting recollection; till then he had &s;tood high in the good opinion of that excellent

young lady; every hour that he pa&s;&s;ed in Man&s;tock-hou&s;e, whil&s;t &s;he was pre&s;ent, made this more and more manife&s;t; even his natural humility of character could not overlook it; he &s;aw the advances he made in her good graces, and only trembled for her danger le&s;t they were too rapid; every look, every action that that was directed towards him had an expre&s;|&s;ion not to be mi&s;taken; Su&s;an's reports con|firmed the intere&s;t that he had e&s;tabli&s;hed in the approving heart of her lovely mi&s;tre&s;s, and the &s;atisfaction which &s;he took in her evening walks with him, with the innocent contrivances &s;he had to prolong and to repeat them, were flattering indications of an attachment forming fa&s;t, if not already formed; the greater there|fore was his fall from hopes &s;o elevated; and what could he now expect from purity like her's, but ab&s;olute di&s;mi&s;&s;ion and contempt?</P>
<P>As for the mea&s;ures he was now to take to|wards his new di&s;covered mother, they &s;eemed to offer nothing to his view but a maze of dif|ficulties. To lay open to her his embara&s;&s;|ments, and make a full confe&s;&s;ion of his faults and misfortunes, was a ta&s;k his re&s;olution was not equal to, neither did it &s;eem a fit &s;ubject

<HEAD>CHAPTER III. Our Hero undergoes a &s;econd Examination by a certain Judge, with whom Con&s;cience has no Concern.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the reverend gentleman, who now vi&s;ited our hero in his humble cot|tage, was left by us, when la&s;t we attended upon him, in the mind to defer this vi&s;it to the next
<PB N="20" REF="24">
morning, yet &s;econd thoughts had made him change that re&s;olve, upon the prudent recollec|tion of the many interventions a procra&s;tinated mea&s;ure is expo&s;ed to, e&s;pecially when it hangs upon the &s;ingle &s;ecurity of a verbal promi&s;e, extorted as it were by &s;urprize, and not deli|berately given upon judgment and inclination. He therefore thought it be&s;t to &s;teal a march upon di&s;appointment, and without communi|cating his intentions to his niece, making only a &s;light apology to Sir Roger, mounted his hor&s;e, and proceeded upon a round trot to the village of Crowbery, pondering by the way upon the mea&s;ures he was to take, and the language he was to hold, for &s;ecuring the im|portant purpo&s;es of his &s;ecret expedition.</P>
<P>There was an air of &s;tudied compo&s;ure in his fir&s;t approaches, with a degree of ob&s;e|quious ceremony, that did not e&s;cape the pe|netrating ob&s;ervation of our hero Henry, who immediately a&s;&s;imilated his &s;tile of addre&s;s to that of his vi&s;itor, and kept him&s;elf on the re|&s;erve. After the u&s;ual &s;alutations had pa&s;&s;ed and repa&s;&s;ed between them, Claypole began to open his commi&s;&s;ion in the following man|ner:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I wait upon you, Sir, on the behalf of
<PB N="21" REF="25">
an orphan niece, for who&s;e happine&s;s and re|putation I have all that tender intere&s;t, which, as a father, I cou'd entertain for an only child. Mi&s;s Claypole, give me leave to &s;ay, is a young lady, on who&s;e character not the &s;lighte&s;t im|putation hitherto has been known to re&s;t; judge therefore with what exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility &s;he feels the con&s;equences of la&s;t night's event, and with what poignant inquietude &s;he is now waiting the confirmation of that promi&s;e, which alone can heal tho&s;e feelings, and relieve her anxious mind from its &s;u&s;pence: &s;he is by nature endow'd with the warme&s;t affections; tho&s;e affections you have gain'd; your fine per|&s;on, engaging attentions, and amiable charac|ter have made a conque&s;t of her heart, and love, which in colder bo&s;oms ripens by degrees, in her's &s;prung up at once to full maturity, and gave you unequivocal proofs how much you was beloved and tru&s;ted: I will not give the name of prudence to a pa&s;&s;ion of this ca&s;t; I mu&s;t as a divine and morali&s;t condemn exce&s;s in every &s;hape; even our mo&s;t virtuous pro|pen&s;ities mu&s;t have bounds &s;et to their exer|tions; and errors, tho' ari&s;ing from motives the mo&s;t generous, merit &s;ome reproof; yet I will confe&s;s to you, that if in any in&s;tance I cou'd
<PB N="22" REF="26">
find excu&s;e for an unbounded confidence, it wou'd be in your's, relying, as I do, with &s;o much ju&s;tice, on your honour and integrity of principle; but, Sir, the virgin fame of an un|tainted character is delicate in the extreme; it is a blo&s;&s;om &s;hrinking at the bla&s;t, wither|ing and drooping with the touch. Tho&s;e fond unguarded moments, which the &s;en&s;uali&s;t calls <HI>golden opportunities,</HI> the man of honour &s;hou'd account as &s;acred, and hold the heart, which love commits into his hands, as an inviolable tru&s;t. Now it has &s;o happened, whether ca&s;ually or providentially we will not enquire, that tho&s;e very proofs of confidence and affection, which mu&s;t have endeared her to you, have expo&s;ed her to reproach and &s;hame, and obliged her to fly from the &s;ociety &s;he was in to my &s;olitary par&s;onage, where &s;he is now hiding her&s;elf in retirement and exclu&s;ion from all vi&s;itors but your&s;elf, anxiou&s;ly awaiting the completion of your promi&s;e to re&s;tore her to her reputation, her happine&s;s, and friends. It is not therefore that I harbour any doubt of your good faith; it is not that I can &s;uppo&s;e you lo&s;t to honour, or in&s;en&s;ible to the beauty, fortune and good qualities of my niece, that I now require a confirmation of your word of
<PB N="23" REF="27">
honour from your own lips, but &s;imply that I may be authoriz'd not only to put her in|quietude to re&s;t, but al&s;o to a&s;&s;ure Sir Roger Man&s;tock, who&s;e delicacy &s;uffers great alarm by what has pa&s;s'd beneath his roof, that there is no call for his remon&s;trances, nor any in&s;ult meditated to a lady under his protection, and for who&s;e redre&s;s he holds him&s;elf re&s;pon&s;ible."</Q></P>
<P>Here Claypole cea&s;ed, and Henry replied as follows:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"A very few words, Sir, will &s;uf|fice to an&s;wer all you have been pleas'd to &s;ay. I perfectly well remember what I have pro|mis'd to Mi&s;s Claypole; and I want neither menaces nor per&s;ua&s;ions to induce me to per|form it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Give me leave then,"</Q> cried Claypole, interpo&s;ing, <Q REND="inline">"to felicitate you on the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a lady, whom I have the vanity to &s;ay, the be&s;t gentleman in the kingdom might be proud to call his wife. I boa&s;t not of her fortune, Sir, that is but a &s;econdary con&s;ideration where &s;o many admirable qualities con&s;pire to make the union happy; and fortune, perhaps, tho' with many the fir&s;t object, may have lo&s;t much of its weight, if any it ever had, in your e&s;teem, &s;ince this great acce&s;&s;ion has &s;o luckily de|volv'd upon you."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="28"><Q REND="inline">"Truly, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Henry in reply, <Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Claypole's fortune never weigh'd with me; and as for this extraordinary beque&s;t of Mr. Blach|ford's, which was totally unthought of, 'tis evident from the recency of the event, that it cou'd never be in contemplation of that lady at the moment of our engagement. It was, as you ob&s;erve, a lucky ca&s;t of chance, and there|fore, I conceive, whether I may or may not be benefited by it, it does not regularly come into que&s;tion between you and me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not as a principal, perhaps, but collateral|ly it does; it gives you means which you was unprovided with before, and therefore, as a friend &s;oon to be connected with you in a near degree, you cannot wonder if I feel a lively intere&s;t in an event &s;o calculated to promote your happine&s;s."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Right, Sir,"</Q> re&s;umed Henry;" <Q REND="inline">it will pro|mote my happine&s;s, as all things mu&s;t that plea&s;e me on reflection, and enable me to &s;ay within my&s;elf, I have fulfilled the golden rule of doing as I wou'd be done by."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That is indeed,"</Q> &s;aid Claypole, grave|ly, <Q REND="inline">"the great rule of Chri&s;tian equity; but I mu&s;t own I do not at this time exactly &s;ee your application of it, for I &s;hou'd &s;up|po&s;e
<PB N="25" REF="29">
the point of con&s;cience rather lies with Blachford than with you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I rather think it lies with both; an act of con&s;cience which we &s;hare between us."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I comprehend you now le&s;s than I did before,"</Q> quoth the baffled interrogator; <Q REND="inline">"will you be pleas'd to explain to me?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"In one &s;ingle word; Mr. Blachford has a &s;on."</Q></P>
<P>Claypole &s;tarted, threw him&s;elf back in his chair, and &s;triking his hands together, after the fa&s;hion of his patron Sir Roger, exclaimed&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Well, Sir, a &s;on! what then? &s;ome ba&s;tard we'll &s;uppo&s;e."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And if we do &s;uppo&s;e it &s;uch, what then?"</Q> &s;aid Henry, retorting his words rather acrimo|niou&s;ly, and pretty nearly in the &s;ame key and cadence.</P>
<P>Claypole pau&s;ed; he recollected probably the point his que&s;tion bore <HI>ad hominem,</HI> and cooly an&s;wered, that the law did not acknow|ledge per&s;ons of that de&s;cription.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But you and I are neither of us lawyers,"</Q> replied our hero, &s;oftening his manner: <Q REND="inline">"You are a divine, a morali&s;t profe&s;t, and as for me, poor altho' I am, and probably in the very &s;ame predicament with this &s;on of nature, yet
<PB N="26" REF="30">
I wou'd fain a&s;pire to copy that great rule of Chri&s;tian equity approv'd by you, and &s;hew that I am not wanting in a &s;en&s;e of honour towards others, no le&s;s than towards Mi&s;s Clay|pole."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Still I am puzzled,"</Q> rejoined Claypole, <Q REND="inline">"to comprehend your meaning: you tell me Blachford has a &s;on. You have not told me that he means to leave him his e&s;tate."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Permit me fir&s;t to a&s;k what you wou'd coun&s;el him to do, had you his con&s;cience in your care."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That is a que&s;tion for my&s;elf, not him: I under&s;tood that you was made his heir by will."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And &s;o I am,"</Q> &s;aid Henry; <Q REND="inline">"but my will mu&s;t be con&s;enting to the execution of the deed."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And what &s;hou'd hinder it? 'Tis an atone|ment for a murderous attempt: he be&s;tows upon you his fortune; he &s;ought to take away your life."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He gave life to this innocent."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Some beggar's brat, perhaps: Blachford was very low in his amours: a &s;mall provi&s;ion may &s;uffice for &s;uch an one."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But I,"</Q> &s;aid Henry, <Q REND="inline">"am no &s;on of
<PB N="27" REF="31">
Blachford's; I covet not his gold: I can for|give my enemy without a bribe, but I cannot &s;trip the child of its inheritance to purcha&s;e the world's wealth; I cannot do it; and I think you do not wi&s;h to &s;ee me rich on &s;uch con|ditions."</Q></P>
<P>To this the reverend vi&s;itor replied, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hou'd have thought, young gentleman, that you had felt the &s;mart of poverty &s;ufficiently to warn you from encountering it afre&s;h: an un|connected being in the world may be romantic at his own expence, but you are not this be|ing; you have claims upon you nearer, I &s;hou'd &s;uppo&s;e, and dearer to you, than this brat of Blachford, which po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome hu&s;&s;ey fathers on him fal&s;ely; and I am unwilling to believe you &s;eriou&s;ly intend to throw good fortune from you, when you &s;o happily might &s;hare it with a well-beloved wife."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Had that lady ever had a &s;hare in it,"</Q> replied Henry, <Q REND="inline">"or had that fortune ever been but hinted at as a contingency within the &s;cope of &s;peculation, I &s;hou'd have &s;omething to account for; but you mu&s;t be con&s;cious how very recently this thing has dropt upon me; and that it is an unlookt for opportunity of being ju&s;t at my own co&s;t; no other per&s;on
<PB N="28" REF="32">
has a part in what I &s;acrifice; and what is that man's hone&s;ty, which does not reach beyond his intere&s;t? If we do well, and &s;uffer for it, that &s;ervice is acceptable. This being a chri&s;|tian principle, I cannot doubt but it is your's."</Q></P>
<P>At the&s;e words the reverend per&s;onage a&s;|&s;umed a look of more than ordinary gravity, in which 'tis po&s;&s;ible &s;ome mixture of wrath might be di&s;cernible, and thus made an&s;wer&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"It is not now a que&s;tion what my prin|ciples may be, but what your's are, and I &s;u&s;|pect that, under a romantic idea of ju&s;tice to others, you forget the ju&s;tice due to your&s;elf and tho&s;e connected with you. If you can lavi&s;h Blachford's whole e&s;tate away at a &s;troke, what &s;ecurity have I that you wou'd not &s;erve Mi&s;s Claypole's in the like manner, was it in your power? Such principles as the&s;e are dangerous to the peace and pro&s;perity of families, and you cannot wonder if, in point of prudence, I am &s;omewhat &s;tagger'd: he that enriches beggars may make rich folks poor. What will my Lady Crowbery &s;ay to this pro|ceeding?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have not a&s;k'd her."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But it will much import you &s;o to do. This fortune wou'd have made you indepen|dent:
<PB N="29" REF="33">
you have now nothing to look to but her favour; and how is it certain, when this bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hall be known, &s;he may not think fit to withdraw it? 'Tis right at lea&s;t that her intentions &s;hou'd be under&s;tood before we ven|ture further. You have al&s;o been engag'd in a duel with a relation of Lord Crowbery's. The&s;e are altogether &s;uch proceedings as may cau&s;e a change of &s;entiment in your patrone&s;s; and what then becomes of my poor niece? I mu&s;t be certified from that noble per&s;onage her&s;elf in what light &s;he regards this mo&s;t ex|traordinary mea&s;ure."</Q></P>
<P>To this Henry replied&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"If you act &s;ole|ly for your&s;elf in this affair, Mr. Claypole, you will act &s;olely from your own judgment; if for your niece, you will probably con&s;ult her wi&s;hes before you take a &s;tep &s;o totally &s;ub|ver&s;ive of the whole tran&s;action, as your refe|rence to Lady Crowbery wou'd be."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I don't under&s;tand you, Sir; did you pro|po&s;e to marry without her con&s;ent?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I certainly had not pledg'd her con&s;ent in my promi&s;e, and did not therefore engage more than my&s;elf to the performance of it. If Mi&s;s Claypole accepts that promi&s;e, my
<PB N="30" REF="34">
honour is attach'd to it, and I hold it &s;acred: if it is referr'd to Lady Crowbery, my re&s;pon|&s;ibility is taken off, and I &s;hall act by her de|ci&s;ion. I hold it as a point of honour to Mi&s;s Claypole, thus to &s;tate it to you; the al|ternative is before you."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Claypole pau&s;ed for reflection, and then demanded, <Q REND="inline">"How wou'd you advi&s;e us to proceed, when it appears that you have no|thing to depend upon but the eventual bounty and protection of the Lady Crowbery? But there is yet another thing,"</Q> added he, <Q REND="inline">"to be explain'd: you inform'd my friend Sir Roger Man&s;tock by a letter which I &s;aw, that you was going out to &s;ea with Captain Cary; I tru&s;t you have no thoughts of that."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pardon me, Sir; &s;uch is my full inten|tion."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Is that con&s;i&s;tent,"</Q> cried Claypole, <Q REND="inline">"with your promi&s;e to my niece?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Perfectly &s;o; &s;he will have no cau&s;e to complain of it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But will Sir Roger Man&s;tock, think you, not oppo&s;e his nephew's taking you on board his &s;hip, under &s;uch circum&s;tances?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I &s;hou'd much fear he will,"</Q> replied

Henry, <Q REND="inline">"if you exert your influence to di&s;|po&s;e him &s;o to do; in that ca&s;e I mu&s;t take &s;ome other means."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Then you are re&s;olv'd at all events to go."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And what to do, permit me to inquire?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I hope,"</Q> &s;aid Henry, <Q REND="inline">"you will not pre&s;s me on that que&s;tion, &s;eeing we do not treat entirely upon confidence; had we &s;o done, I &s;hou'd hold nothing back.

<P>Claypole fore&s;aw that here the conference mu&s;t end. <Q REND="inline">"That &s;ecret,"</Q> he replied, <Q REND="inline">"may ea&s;ily be gue&s;s'd at."</Q>&mdash;Then added in con|clu&s;ion&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall make true report of what you tell me to my niece."</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER V. Our Hero is admitted to an unexpected Conference.</HEAD>
<P>WHILST this was pa&s;&s;ing in the cot|tage, Captain Crowbery, after his ren|contre with Henry, had returned to the ca&s;tle, and in a conver&s;ation with his cou&s;in the Vi&s;|count had done ju&s;tice to the &s;pirited beha|viour of his antagoni&s;t, relating the grounds of their quarrel, the words that had pa&s;&s;ed at their meeting, and all the particulars con&s;e|quential of it. Now it &s;o happened, that the peer was con&s;cious of being as deep in the plot of the pre&s;s-gang as his kin&s;man, but he was not con&s;cious of the &s;ame courage to face the re&s;entment of our hero: the &s;tory, there|fore, cau&s;ed certain perturbations in his Lord|&s;hip's mind not altogether agreeable, and he became extremely anxious to be a&s;&s;ured that
<PB N="37" REF="41">
the affair was made up &s;o completely, that no after-reckonings could be &s;tarted, which he him&s;elf might be called upon to account for. Nothing humbles &s;ome people's pride &s;o much as fear; the pride of Lord Crowbery hardly &s;tooped to any other corrector. On the pre|&s;ent occa&s;ion, it was thoroughly brought down by more fears than one, for the Captain had brought the news of Henry's being heir to Blachford, which not only cut up his Lord|&s;hip's intere&s;ted expectations from that quarter, but brought to his recollection certain papers and corre&s;pondences in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;aid te&s;tator, which would naturally fall into the hands of his executor, and di&s;clo&s;e matters very inconvenient to his Lord&s;hip to have re|vealed. How to get the&s;e out of Henry's reach was now the que&s;tion; he had called frequently at the &s;ick man's door for that pur|po&s;e, but had never been admitted; and to the&s;e documents, if they were yet in exi&s;tence, not only his reputation, but what was dearer to him &s;till, his per&s;onal &s;afety, was committed.</P>
<P>It was now that he regretted his former haughty treatment of our hero; he felt him|&s;elf the dupe of Blachford, and perceived that he had practi&s;ed upon his jealou&s;y with no
<PB N="38" REF="42">
other view but to &s;erve his own revengeful purpo&s;es, and engage him as a party in his plots again&s;t an innocent man. Nay, it is to be pre&s;umed, he was not quite proof again&s;t the many in&s;tances of Henry's honourable conduct; and the impre&s;&s;ion Captain Crowbery had now received of our hero's behaviour was &s;uch, as had made a total change in his &s;enti|ments, and that gentleman was now become as zealous an advocate and admirer, as before he was an enemy and a per&s;ecutor of Henry. Lord Crowbery, who had motives not quite &s;o honourable, but not le&s;s cogent, for making his peace with our hero, lent a willing ear to the commendations that his cou&s;in be&s;towed upon him, and declared him&s;elf &s;o fully con|vinced that he had been betrayed by Blachford into groundle&s;s jealou&s;ies and &s;u&s;picions, that he propo&s;ed inviting him to his hou&s;e, and in|dulging him with a vi&s;it to his benefactre&s;s upon the eve of her departure, as a token of his entire reconciliation, and to do away, by this mark of his confidence, all tho&s;e reports that had been circulated again&s;t the reputation of his Lady.</P>
<P>This propo&s;al being heartily &s;econded by the Captain, Lord Crowbery immediately re|paired
<PB N="39" REF="43">
to the chamber of his Lady, and ap|proaching her with a mild and gracious look, he began by a&s;&s;uring her that he had entirely and for ever di&s;mi&s;&s;ed every relic of un|kindne&s;s and &s;u&s;picion from his mind; that he was &s;en&s;ible he had been led into error, and alarmed without rea&s;on as to her partiality for Henry; that he &s;aw it now not only in the mo&s;t innocent but mo&s;t amiable light, and he wi&s;hed her to per&s;i&s;t in the protection of one &s;o well de&s;erving. Le&s;t &s;he &s;hould doubt the &s;incerity of his conver&s;ion to an opinion &s;o directly oppo&s;ite to what he had lately held, he repeated, in &s;hort, the &s;ub&s;tance of the conver|&s;ation he had ju&s;t had with his kin&s;man, and concluded by &s;aying, that as he was per&s;uaded &s;he mu&s;t wi&s;h to &s;ee Henry, and to take leave of him before her departure, he propo&s;ed, with her con&s;ent, to &s;end for him to his hou&s;e, where &s;he her&s;elf &s;hould be a witne&s;s of the recep|tion he would give him.</P>
<P>Lady Crowbery heard this propo&s;al with a &s;en&s;ation of plea&s;ure not entirely clear from &s;u&s;picion of its &s;incerity, yet as &s;he could rea|dily comprehend &s;ome rea&s;ons that her Lord might have for altering his tone at lea&s;t, if not his temper, &s;he was not backward to embrace
<PB N="40" REF="44">
it with as good a grace as &s;he was capable of a&s;&s;uming. Few favours could be le&s;s ex|pected than that of her being permitted to vi&s;it Man&s;tock hou&s;e; this was an indulgence far beyond all hope or conjecture, yet, as &s;he owed the fir&s;t to the influence of Mr. L&mdash;, &s;he might al&s;o be indebted to him, jointly with Captain Crowbery, for this further in&s;tance of a revolution, either real or affected, in the con|duct and opinions of her Lord: and now the Captain with much alacrity undertook to be the bearer of a very civil invitation to our hero on the part of the Vi&s;count, reque&s;ting him forthwith to repair to the Ca&s;tle, where Lady Crowbery was expecting his arrival.</P>
<P>He obeyed the &s;ummons, and being pre|pared for a kind reception by the Captain, who accompanied him from the cottage, he was u&s;hered without delay to the chamber of his mother, where my Lord was waiting, and with as much addre&s;s as he was ma&s;ter of, wel|comed him to his hou&s;e, &s;aying, that he hoped all former mi&s;under&s;tandings would be for|gotten, and that they might be good friends and neighbours in all future time. To this Henry made a proper reply in the &s;ame &s;tile of civility, and approached towards Lady
<PB N="41" REF="45">
Crowbery, to pay her his re&s;pects &s;ilently and cautiou&s;ly, with a tender look of pity and at|tention. Her languid but &s;till lovely counte|nance cut him to the heart; the change her frame and features had undergone &s;ince la&s;t he &s;aw her was too vi&s;ible. Turning from a &s;pec|tacle &s;o affecting, he &s;aid,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"It is very kind in you, my Lord, to allow me to pay this me|lancholy duty to my benefactre&s;s; 'tis gene|rous to have this con&s;ideration for one, who, with all the pure&s;t &s;entiments of gratitude to the only friend he has in life, is now at length permitted to approach her: I humbly thank you for this great indulgence."</Q></P>
<P>His voice could execute no more&mdash;not a word was attempted by the mother.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I'll leave you to your&s;elves,"</Q> &s;aid Lord Crow|bery, <Q REND="inline">"and give orders that you &s;hall not be di&s;turbed; your time and privacy &s;hall be your own."</Q></P>
<P>The door was &s;hut; his &s;tep was heard upon the &s;tairs; nature was freed from all re|&s;traint; Henry dropt on his knee, and bathed his mother's hand with tears.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"My &s;on, my &s;on!"</Q> was all that &s;he could utter. To at|tempt the recapitulation of this tender dia|logue would be in vain, for words can ill de|&s;cribe
<PB N="42" REF="46">
a &s;cene like this; and he mu&s;t be an actor rather than author, that can give life to repre&s;entatives of &s;on and mother in &s;uch touching &s;ituations. The matter, not the manner, lies within my powers. Henry im|parted to her his plan of meeting her at Li&s;|bon, by the favour of Captain Cary, now up|on the point of &s;ailing.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Did &s;he approve of his &s;o doing?"</Q>&mdash;She mo&s;t highly approved of it, and warmly recommended it, for rea&s;ons intere&s;ting to him, no le&s;s than to her&s;elf: &s;he had received a verbal intimation, through a confidential channel, from his father, Mr. Dela|poer, avowing him&s;elf the per&s;on who had &s;ent her the ring as a token of his affectionate remembrance of her, and faithful adherence to his fir&s;t vows, through many years of ab&s;ence, and a long cour&s;e of various adventures; that he &s;till con&s;idered him&s;elf as her hu&s;band in heart; and hearing with the deepe&s;t concern that her ca&s;e was &s;uch as made it nece&s;&s;ary for her to re&s;ort to Li&s;bon, he had determined to ha&s;ten thither him&s;elf, in the hope that he might be permitted there to devote his ho|nourable attentions to her &s;ervice, and ap|prove him&s;elf &s;till gratefully impre&s;&s;ed with that pure but ardent attachment, which no
<PB N="43" REF="47">
ab&s;ence had been able to abate, and which to the la&s;t hour of life he &s;hould unalterably re|tain.</P>
<P>This intelligence was in all re&s;pects mo&s;t &s;atisfactory to Henry, who had now a certain|ty of his father being living, and a fair pro&s;pect of retrieving his late di&s;appointment, by a &s;peedy meeting. We &s;hall not be minute in detailing all that was &s;aid by the re&s;pective parties upon this intere&s;ting topic, nor &s;hall we be more particular in &s;tating what pa&s;&s;ed between them on the &s;ubject of Blachford's will; it may &s;uffice to &s;ay, that Henry's di&s;|intere&s;ted renunciation of the beque&s;t, in favour of a natural heir, met with full approbation and applau&s;e from his generous mother, who concluded her remarks upon the tran&s;action, by declaring, that from the fir&s;t moment &s;he had heard of it, &s;he had never cordially re|conciled her&s;elf to the circum&s;tance of her &s;on's being made heir to a fortune &s;o ama&s;&s;ed and &s;o devi&s;ed, which not only robbed him of the credit of forgiving a repentant enemy, freely and unconditionally, but which would probably involve him in trouble and per|plexity, and &s;et him forth to the world under a &s;u&s;picion of foul dealing, which &s;he could
<PB N="44" REF="48">
not bear to have his character expo&s;ed to, and be made a topic for detraction, for the mere worldly advantages of &s;tepping into a man's fortune, who bore no other relation or alliance to him, than as one, who having been his enemy and intentional a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, had by a death-bed repentance been converted to a friend and unexpected benefactor. It was therefore with the mo&s;t heartfelt &s;atisfaction &s;he &s;aw him endowed with &s;pirit to judge and act &s;o con&s;onantly to her feelings, without any ad|vice on her part, or any knowledge on his of the extent of her intentions towards him, which, &s;he would now inform him, were no le&s;s than to bequeath him the whole and entire e&s;tate of her father, which by will &s;he was in|ve&s;ted with; a property &s;o ample, that the &s;u|perfluous beque&s;t of Mr. Blachford was no longer worth a thought.</P>
<P>This led her to &s;peak of Sir Roger, in who&s;e hands &s;he had lodged her will; and after en|quiring of her &s;on how he had pa&s;&s;ed his time at Man&s;tock Hou&s;e, with a view to di&s;cover what the &s;tate of his heart was towards the fair I&s;abella, turning to him with a look of maternal affection, &s;he &s;aid&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Ah! my be|loved Henry, wou'd you know the fir&s;t and
<PB N="45" REF="49">
warme&s;t wi&s;h of your fond mother's heart, it is that you may gain an intere&s;t with that lovely girl, &s;o form'd to make you happy: I know her to be &s;o devoted to her father, as to have profe&s;t certain re&s;olutions, which I hold to be romantic; and I can well believe it mu&s;t be a lover of no common qualities, that can induce her to forego them; but as you can|not in your pre&s;ent unacknowledg'd character hope to engage the con&s;ent of my uncle, nor honourably make known your real preten&s;ions to I&s;abella her&s;elf, I have that perfect tru&s;t in her honour, that I am ready to confide to her alone the &s;ecret of your being my &s;on, if you can give me hope there is that di&s;po&s;ition in her, which, upon this di&s;covery, might be improv'd to your advantage: tell me there|fore with &s;incerity how you &s;tand in her good graces, and to-morrow, when &s;he and I are alone at Man&s;tock, I will be your advocate, and throw my&s;elf upon her candour for your &s;ake."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Heaven ble&s;s you for your goodne&s;s!"</Q> cried Henry; <Q REND="inline">"how can I ever thank you as I ought? What can I &s;ay or do, or undertake for your &s;ake, that may but in the lea&s;t degree demon&s;trate to you my gratitude for all your

bounties? Let me attempt &s;ome act of duty, which no &s;on has ever yet a&s;pir'd to! let me forbear to think of love and I&s;abella, whil&s;t your life, &s;o dear to me above all earthly ble&s;|&s;ings, hangs in this dangerous &s;u&s;pence. I will not &s;uffer any other thought to lodge within my heart: Oh! my beloved honour'd mother, let me devote my&s;elf to you alone."</Q></P>
<P>Here he again ca&s;t him&s;elf at her feet, whil&s;t &s;he threw her arms about his neck and pre&s;&s;ed him to her bo&s;om;&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"My &s;on! my &s;oul!"</Q> &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline">"this tran&s;port of affection is a cordial to your &s;ick mother, that gives her a new life: your love revives me, my dear child, and &s;eems to animate my languid frame with health and &s;trength.

<P>At this moment Zachary Cawdle entered
<PB N="47" REF="51">

</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER VI. The Conference is interrupted, re&s;umed, and con|cluded.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH Zachary was informed that Henry was with his patient, and knew, without being informed, that the minutes of their privacy were extremely precious, yet as he was fixt in the opinion that all things ought to give way to medicine and method, he did not permit any &s;cruples to &s;top him, as &s;oon as ever the clock gave notice that the four hours draught was in turn to be repeated. In this in&s;tance however, the feelings of the &s;on did not entirely corre&s;pond with tho&s;e of the mother, and the interruption that gave pain to her, was to him a &s;en&s;ible relief, for in this interval of time he had &s;o far recollected him&s;elf, as to be prepared again&s;t the dilemma,
<PB N="48" REF="52">
to which he was now driven with re&s;pect to I&s;abella. The fir&s;t caution, that occurred to his thoughts, was to divert Lady Crowbery from her propo&s;al of divulging the &s;ecret of his birth to Mi&s;s Man&s;tock, or taking any mea&s;ures with that young lady for intere&s;ting her in his favour, e&s;teeming it unfair that any attempt &s;hould be made on her affections on his behalf, circum&s;tanced as he was with re|&s;pect to Fanny Claypole: the next thing that &s;truck him, was the propriety of hold|ing back from his mother the vexatious em|barra&s;&s;ment he was involved in with the lady la&s;t mentioned, at lea&s;t till the re&s;ult of her uncle's report, and her re&s;olutions thereupon, were made known to him. From the language lately held by Mr. Claypole he &s;till nouri&s;hed a faint hope that it was po&s;&s;ible he might be &s;et loo&s;e from his unfortunate engagement, an emancipation that he would have thought cheaply purcha&s;ed by the &s;acrifice of Blach|ford's legacy; and in this interim, why was he to be the fir&s;t to publi&s;h an affair not over delicate in the recital, and certainly not very reputable to the lady in que&s;tion? If he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, the lea&s;t he could do was to keep his own &s;ecret; if not, it became his intere&s;t
<PB N="49" REF="53">
to uphold her reputation by all the means in his power: he therefore prudently determined not to open him&s;elf on this painful and afflict|ing &s;ubject.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had the punctual man of me|dicine left them at liberty to re&s;ume their conver&s;ation, than Henry, taking up the &s;ub|ject where Lady Crowbery had left it, ad|dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to her as follows:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I &s;hou'd be a&s;ham'd of prevarication in your pre&s;ence, more e&s;pecially as you declare that my heart is in your &s;ight, which that it may de&s;erve to be, both now and for ever, it behoves me to keep it clear from di&s;&s;imulation and hy|pocri&s;y: I am flatter'd therefore, when you &s;ay that you di&s;cern in it affection and e&s;teem for the lovelie&s;t and mo&s;t amiable of her &s;ex, as I mu&s;t own you wou'd have rea&s;on to turn away your eyes with loathing and aver&s;ion had you found it unempa&s;&s;ion'd by her charms or in&s;en&s;ible to her perfections. Ble&s;t indeed mu&s;t be the man who cou'd boa&s;t of the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of a heart like her's, and who&s;e pre|ten&s;ions might be &s;anction'd by her father's free con&s;ent; but as I hold my&s;elf excluded from all chance of &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ing, and am per&s;uaded that my de&s;tiny is otherwi&s;e direct|ed,
<PB N="50" REF="54">
I do mo&s;t earne&s;tly implore my kind and generous mother, not only not to let the &s;ecret of my birth, and the too liberal di&s;po&s;ition of her fortune, pa&s;s her lips, but al&s;o to refrain from moving the &s;oft heart of I&s;abella in my favour: let that &s;weet nature be at peace, nor &s;tir her any farther to a thought of me, than as of one who knows him&s;elf unworthy her regards, and hopele&s;sly admires and honours her. If I had ever any place in her affections, let it wear out by ab&s;ence; let me, like her, devote my&s;elf to filial duty, and then, although our objects are alike, our de&s;tinations will be widely apart: Li&s;bon and Man&s;tock Hou&s;e will make a cha&s;m between us, over which I hope no &s;igh of her's will ever pa&s;s. That you believe me worthy &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ing is an honour above all merit; that you would ri&s;que your &s;ecret, and engage your&s;elf to plead for me to I&s;abella, is a mark of your benevolence, for which I am ever bound to you; but I mo&s;t &s;olemnly implore you for the pre&s;ent to withold it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, my dear Henry,"</Q> the tender mother replied, <Q REND="inline">"I'll not go counter to your wi&s;hes, but give you credit for the principle on which you act, though I confe&s;s you puzzle and &s;ur|prize

<P>Henry had by this time collected his thoughts &s;ufficiently to &s;ee the danger into which he had been &s;urprized, and how far he had out&s;tept di&s;cretion in this unguarded de|claration of his pa&s;&s;ion; he was therefore eager to avail him&s;elf of the opening, which his mother's temperate an&s;wer gave him, for drawing back in time to &s;ave him&s;elf, without committing Fanny Claypole; and though it was pretty clear that Lady Crowbery's &s;u&s;|picion pointed at Su&s;an May, yet as &s;he was not directly named, and time would quickly &s;erve for him to clear her character, he ac|quie&s;ced in the deception, and was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>It was now time to put an end to their con|ference; but before this took place, he was fain to compound for a relea&s;e from all further enquiries, by promi&s;ing to remain where he

<HEAD>CHAPTER VII. The Penitent, on his Death-bed, atones to Ju&s;tice.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Henry arrived at the cottage, he found the nur&s;e with Su&s;an May's child waiting his return: in a few minutes after, the chai&s;e with the mother her&s;elf drove to the door. Ezekiel Daw was at this time in at|tendance upon his penitent. Henry put the nur&s;e and child into the inner chamber, and no third per&s;on being pre&s;ent at his meeting with Su&s;an, he proceeded without interruption to explain to her the purpo&s;es for which he had called her from Man&s;tock Hou&s;e, and in &s;peaking of her connection with Blachford,
<PB N="56" REF="60">
treated her feelings with &s;uch delicacy (a&s;&s;uring her, that by the confe&s;&s;ion of her &s;educer &s;he would &s;tand acquitted to all that heard the &s;tory) that his con&s;ideration for her character, no le&s;s than the very extraordinary &s;acrifice he had made to her intere&s;t, &s;o affected her, as to leave her no other powers of expre&s;&s;ing her gratitude, except what her tears, which flowed in plenty, could &s;upply.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Wonder not,"</Q> he cried, <Q REND="inline">"at what I have done, as if it was a ca&s;e uncommon for a man to be ju&s;t and hone&s;t. What have I to do with Blachford and his money? If he had be|queath'd it to me, and died before I had made this di&s;covery of the claim you have upon him, I &s;hou'd have held my&s;elf obliged in con|&s;cience to make over what he left me to your &s;on and you. New I do not wi&s;h to make a parade of my di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, and &s;hou'd hold it rather as an affront to be compliment|ed for an act of ju&s;tice, regarding it as a hint, that they &s;u&s;pected me to be a knave; I there|fore think my&s;elf very happy to have found your &s;ecret out in time, to make that an act of atonement on his part, which, had it devolv'd upon me, wou'd have put me to the trouble of a conveyance, and annoy'd me very pro|bably
<PB N="57" REF="61">
with a great deal of that popularity and applau&s;e, which &s;ome people are flatter'd with, but which I have no ta&s;te for."</Q></P>
<P>When Henry, by this and other repre&s;enta|tions like this, perceived that he had in &s;ome degree quieted the agitation of Su&s;an's &s;pirits, he put her in mind to make ready for an in|terview with the father of her child, and hav|ing &s;tept into the inner room, he pre&s;ented to her &s;ight the child it&s;elf, giving it into her arms, and declaring it to be his ward, and the infant heir of Blachford. The beauty of the child, the ec&s;tacy of the mother, the a&s;toni&s;h|ment of the nur&s;e, and the benevolence de|picted in the features of our blooming hero, compo&s;ed a group of characters not totally unworthy the hi&s;toric pencil of <HI>the painter of the pa&s;&s;ions.</HI></P>
<P>The generous heart of Henry, in the con|templation of this &s;cene, enjoyed a more lux|urious banquet than the wealth of Blachford could have purcha&s;ed. True gratitude, like deep-felt woe, is not to be di&s;charged by words; Su&s;an was mute, and once, if Henry had not &s;topt her, &s;he was falling at his feet.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"What are you about to do?</Q> he cried. <Q REND="inline">"Re|member, you once tender'd me your all; I'm

only paying you with what is not my own."</Q>&mdash;And now bidding her take heart and follow him, he proceeded with her, the infant, and the nur&s;e, to the &s;ick man's hou&s;e: they were admitted without delay; Blachford was im|patiently expecting them, and Ezekiel Daw was in the chamber with him. Henry took the child in his arms, and advancing to the couch, pre&s;ented it to its father&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I have brought,"</Q> he cried, <Q REND="inline">"two comforters to vi&s;it you; the one, in the per&s;on of this &s;miling cherub, &s;eems the very emblem of peace; the other, (pointing to Su&s;an as he &s;poke) by your ju&s;tice rein&s;tated in her innocence, and indem|nified for her injuries, will heal tho&s;e inward pains that agonize us more than all our fle&s;hly wounds: accept them, cheri&s;h them, embrace them; they will brighten every moment of your life, and the la&s;t moment more than all; in this life, they will be the witne&s;&s;es and re|corders of your penitence, in the life to come your advocates and interce&s;&s;ors at the throne of mercy."</Q>&mdash;Blachford took the child in his arms, and li&s;ting up his eyes, exclaimed&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"The Lord of mercy grant their interce&s;&s;ions may avail!"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Amen!"</Q> echoed the pious Ezekiel, from a corner of the room, to which
<PB N="59" REF="63">
he had retreated, and where, dropping on his knees, he &s;ilently put up a fervent and (let us hope) not ineffectual prayer.</P>
<P>Blachford, who&s;e mind was now prepared for death, and felt the awful coming on, was in&s;tant in his wi&s;hes to complete the la&s;t re|maining ta&s;k he had to do on earth, whil&s;t yet his &s;en&s;es were entire. The lawyer was in waiting, and Zachary, with his &s;ub-&s;urgeon Kinloch, coming in mo&s;t opportunely at the in&s;tant, all things &s;eemed to favour the im|portant work, and nothing now was wanting but the concluding forms to make it perfect. Blachford was rai&s;ed upon his couch to &s;ign and &s;eal; the materials were &s;et before him, the witne&s;&s;es &s;tood round him, when turning his eyes on Zachary fir&s;t, and next on Kin|loch, he &s;aid,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I call upon you, gentlemen, to atte&s;t upon the faith of hone&s;t men, and able judges of my &s;ituation, that I am now in mental faculties &s;ound and competent to ex|ecute this deed, declaring it my will and te&s;ta|ment, by which I make this infant, born of Su&s;an May here pre&s;ent, and my &s;on, of her be|gotten out of wedlock, &s;ole heir of all my property, &s;ave what is herein given and be|queathed to her, the mother, by annuity charged

<P>Having &s;aid this, and the appeal he had made to Zachary and his attendant being an|&s;wered with a&s;&s;urances of their entire convic|tion of his being in perfect po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his &s;en&s;es (a point indeed which no one of his hearers could be deceived in) he &s;igned and &s;ealed his will, and, after it was witne&s;&s;ed, de|livered

it to Henry. Exhau&s;ted by the&s;e ef|forts, he began &s;o evidently to droop, that Doctor Cawdle, in virtue of his medical au|thority, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the whole company. The mother, child and nur&s;e were by Blachford's de&s;ire accommodated with beds in his hou&s;e; Henry contented him&s;elf with his quarters at the cottage; but having hitherto ab&s;tained from a&s;king any que&s;tions about a matter that was neare&s;t to his heart, and the bu&s;ine&s;s to which he had devoted his fir&s;t attention being &s;o happily concluded, he became impatient for a few minutes in private with his friend Su&s;an. Of this wi&s;hed-for opportunity he was &s;oon put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; for Ezekiel, on who&s;e mind the&s;e events had made a powerful im|pre&s;&s;ion, had walked home in deep meditation, without &s;aying a word to any body; where|upon Su&s;an, having given her boy in charge to the nur&s;e, retired with Henry into Blach|ford's parlour. It was the very room where the one party had been arraigned for his life, and the other de&s;poiled of her innocence. What mighty revolutions can a few &s;hort days effect! the offender at the point of death, the &s;ufferers re&s;tored to their character, and the property of the guilty, including the very &s;cene
<PB N="62" REF="66">
of his criminality, actually made over as an atonement to the guiltle&s;s.</P>
<P>Henry, to prevent interruption, made fa&s;t the door, and taking Su&s;an by the hand, led her to a chair: &s;he was &s;till trembling with agitation; tremors of another &s;ort would have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her, had Henry &s;o done a while ago: &s;he now looked up to him with aweful admi|ration; love, tempered with re&s;pect, gave that cha&s;te expre&s;&s;ion to her eyes, which on &s;ome pa&s;t occa&s;ions had exhibited affections not &s;o pure: pa&s;&s;ions as irre&s;i&s;tible as that which now had command of her more than once had impelled her to embrace him wantonly in her arms; pure gratitude, unmixed with any gro&s;&s;er impul&s;e, now threw her, bathed in tears, upon his neck: he pre&s;&s;ed her tenderly to his bo&s;om, &s;poke of the kindne&s;&s;es &s;he had &s;o often &s;hewn him, and a&s;&s;erted obligations re|ceived on his part, prior and &s;uperior to the&s;e conferred on her; when, having &s;oothed her in this generous manner for &s;ome minutes&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Now tell me, I conjure you,"</Q> he cried, <Q REND="inline">"and tell me truly, am I totally undone in the opinion of your lovely mi&s;tre&s;s?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Alas!"</Q> &s;he replied, <Q REND="inline">"what can I tell you, my dear friend and benefactor? certain it is,

knows to be a property that hangs upon his hands, and keeps him in alarm for every day that pa&s;&s;es till he is rid of her. Believe me, my dear Sir, that uncle is a deep one; not a &s;ervant in the family but laments the influence he has over their good ma&s;ter; and though Mi&s;s Man&s;tock is too delicate to &s;peak out, I can di&s;cover to a certainty that &s;he is not mi&s;|taken in his character; no, nor my Lady Crowbery neither, though it is given out in the hou&s;e that he is to &s;ucceed to your Mr. Ratcliffe's living."</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VIII. An Incident of the Tragic Ca&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>IF there is not a &s;ecret joy in being &s;trictly faithful to the rigid laws of honour, our hero mu&s;t have been at this moment of all men mo&s;t mi&s;erable; for he might well pre|&s;ume that I&s;abella's letter was a kind one; and what had this world to give him comparable to a te&s;timony of her kindne&s;s? Nothing but the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of acting right. Educated in the mo&s;t correct adherence to truth and rec|titude, he had no &s;ophi&s;try to palliate the &s;lighte&s;t deviation from them, and &s;huddered at deceit however qualified. Stung to the quick by his remor&s;e for having been a party in the cau&s;e, if not the cau&s;e it&s;elf, of Fanny Claypole's mi&s;behaviour, he took her &s;hame upon him&s;elf; and vexed at the recollection of his own weak facility in falling in with her advances, he determined to meet the con&s;e|quences he had drawn upon him&s;elf, unle&s;s re&s;cued either by her voluntary relea&s;e, or &s;ome &s;uch unequivocal proofs of her mi&s;conduct as
<PB N="72" REF="78">
might ju&s;tify him in renouncing the connection. Upon his return to the cottage, he found Eze|kiel in the act of con&s;oling him&s;elf with his afternoon's pipe, whil&s;t his bible laid open on the table before him. The pious creature was in profound meditation upon the book of Proverbs, on which he was founding an ad|monitory di&s;cour&s;e for the edification of Su&s;an May, whom, though he had exculpated in the face of her reverend accu&s;er, yet it mu&s;t be owned to have been a &s;light &s;tretch upon the truth of his opinion, extorted from him in his zeal for &s;aying the be&s;t of a friend, and for oppo&s;ing any &s;entiment of Claypole, who was ju&s;t then in no high favour with him, or, more properly &s;peaking, in &s;overeign contempt. Occupied in this manner, he took &s;o little no|tice of Henry, on his coming into the room, that it might be doubted if he &s;aw him; and Henry, on his part, had his thoughts too much employed to &s;olicit his attention.</P>
<P>A me&s;&s;enger now rode up to the door, and being acco&s;ted by Henry, put a letter into his hands, the contents of which were as fol|lows:&mdash;</P>
<LETTER>
<P>My uncle, who &s;ees mo&s;t things in a fal&s;e light, thinks you have done very unwi&s;ely in

declining Blachford's fortune; but money is his god, and love is mine. I build my happine&s;s upon better things than riches, and admire your &s;pirit; though I mu&s;t own it wou'd not have been ami&s;s had you taken the fellow's dirty pelf, rather than it &s;hou'd fall into the hands of tho&s;e low creatures, who are in the way now to profit by it. I &s;hou'd like to live at Crowbery, and have particular rea&s;ons for wi&s;hing you to re&s;erve that place at lea&s;t to your&s;elf, whatever becomes of the re&s;t of the property.

<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your fond expecting FRANCES CLAYPOLE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>This was a puzzling dilemma; Henry had promi&s;ed his mother to obey her &s;ummons if &s;he called him to her at Man&s;tock-hou&s;e; he could not therefore tell Mi&s;s Claypole he was going to his &s;hip the next day, neither could he with any face come to Man&s;tock without vi&s;iting her; if therefore he was ever to &s;ee her, better he &s;hould go before Lady Crow|bery arrived at her uncle's; and whatever was to be the re&s;ult of his meeting, better he &s;hould bring it to a definitive conclu&s;ion before he put him&s;elf in the way of I&s;abella, who&s;e at|tentions to him, whil&s;t his fate was in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, would embarra&s;s him beyond mea&s;ure, as not knowing how far he might be warranted in honour to receive them.</P>
<P>It was now about &s;even o'clock in an au|tumnal evening, the di&s;tance twelve miles, and
<PB N="75" REF="81">
the me&s;&s;enger was well mounted: he was a country fellow, and no dome&s;tic of Claypole's. Henry a&s;ked him if he would lend him his hor&s;e, and take money for hiring another at the po&s;t town two miles off. This propo&s;al, backed with a piece of gold, was perfectly ac|ceptable to the me&s;&s;enger, and Henry &s;tept into the cottage to apprize his friend Ezekiel of his motions, and to equip him&s;elf for the &s;addle. A very &s;hort apology &s;atisfied Ezekiel, who&s;e thoughts were farther from home than Henry would be at the end of his &s;tage; as &s;oon therefore as he had drawn on his boots, and &s;ignified his intentions of &s;leeping at Dame May's, he &s;et off at a &s;mart rate, and within the hour arrived &s;afely at the vicarage gate.</P>
<P>Great was the tran&s;port of Fanny Claypole when the object of her anxious expectation pre&s;ented him&s;elf to her &s;ight; &s;he flung the book &s;he was reading from her, and ran with open arms, in an ec&s;tacy, to embrace him: wild with &s;urprize and joy, &s;he &s;carce knew what &s;he did; with her hair loo&s;e and flowing, &s;he &s;eemed a perfect Sybil in her phrenzy; her dre&s;s (if dre&s;s it might be called, that totally ob&s;cured no charms which nature had en|dowed her with) was &s;o invitingly di&s;po&s;ed as
<PB N="76" REF="82">
&s;hewed the effects of &s;tudy and de&s;ign rather than of chance or negligence; for little was con|cealed that could allure, yet not &s;o much ex|po&s;ed as to leave nothing for imagination to &s;upply; and a fairer field for excur&s;ions of that &s;ort could hardly be found than in the form of Fanny.</P>
<P>When her flutter had in part &s;ub&s;ided, &s;he threw her&s;elf on the couch in a carele&s;s atti|tude, and ob&s;erving that Henry kept him&s;elf aloof, and did not take her hint for &s;eating him&s;elf by her, &s;he demanded what was the matter with him? had not he recovered his alarm in the gallery? or was he waiting for another thunder &s;torm before he could find in his heart any pity for a poor di&s;con&s;olate dam&s;el, who had no &s;oul in the hou&s;e to pro|tect her but one old woman, who had neither eyes, ears, nor under&s;tanding? <Q REND="inline">"Here we are,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"without one &s;oul that will come near us for the live-long night, and what will become of me Heaven only knows, in this de&s;olate man&s;ion, unle&s;s you will man|fully undertake to guard me, and turn into the vicar's bed for the night."</Q></P>
<P>Henry &s;miled, and &s;hook his head.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Po|&s;itively,"</Q> re&s;umed &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"I cannot part from
<PB N="77" REF="83">
you; I wou'd as &s;oon &s;leep among&s;t the tombs as in this dreary &s;olitude, with no other cen|tinel than the &s;noring old dame in the garret. Now I know as well as can be, by your looks, what is pa&s;&s;ing in your mind: my uncle has been preaching to you in his canting &s;train; but I take no account of what he thinks or what he &s;ays; I am independent of him and the whole world; and if you &s;uppo&s;e my peace of mind can be di&s;turb'd by their talk, you are mi&s;taken; where I have be&s;tow'd my heart I am not afraid to entru&s;t my reputation: &s;urely, if I a&s;k protection of you, you will not refu&s;e it to me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Certainly I will not,"</Q> &s;aid Henry; <Q REND="inline">"but as no danger can accrue to your per&s;on, tho' I &s;hou'd leave you, and much to your reputa|tion if I &s;hou'd remain with you, can there be a doubt what I ought to do?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Ridicu|lous!"</Q> re&s;umed &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"this over-care of what the world may &s;ay, if you per&s;i&s;t in it, will make me doubt if I have form'd a right opi|nion of your character.

What care I if the whole world knew that you &s;lept in this hou&s;e? The thing
<PB N="78" REF="84">
&s;peaks for it&s;elf; I am mi&s;tre&s;s of my choice, and you the man I have cho&s;en; let the world comment upon that as it likes. I have quitted &s;ociety, and put my&s;elf into &s;olitude for your &s;ake; to whom then but to you am I to re&s;ort for protection, for con&s;olement, nay, for ju&s;ti|fication? Where el&s;e &s;hall I go? To my uncle? Never; I have done with him; I re|nounce him; I am your's and only your's. We have interchang'd our hearts: what wit|ne&s;&s;es do we need of that? Not all the par&s;ons in the kingdom can do more, and without this their ceremonies are but mockeries; there|fore let's hear no more of this affected ten|derne&s;s for reputation, this hypocri&s;y of &s;en|timent, which wou'd refine away the noble&s;t pa&s;&s;ions of the &s;oul; let our love be without canting, our confidence without re&s;traint; and to convince you of my &s;incerity in both re|&s;pects, I am free to confe&s;s that it is not to any real terrors I experienc'd in the &s;torm that you are indebted for the endearments I be&s;tow'd on you la&s;t night; they were the free effu&s;ions of my heart, and you may tell your con&s;cience to be quiet on that &s;core; for it was love, my Henry, not the elements, that threw me in your power, and the &s;ame love now

courts you to the &s;ame endearments, &s;ecret and &s;ecure from all di&s;turbers of our hours &s;o precious. Come then, throw off that cold re&s;erve, tho&s;e di&s;tant looks that have no &s;ym|pathy with mine. My eyes are hone&s;t and &s;incere; they &s;peak a plain intelligible lan|guage; what ails your's, that they cannot or will not under&s;tand it without compelling me, again&s;t the practice of my &s;ex, to help you to a comment?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is becau&s;e I do under&s;tand their lan|guage, and feel their power,"</Q> replied Henry, <Q REND="inline">"that I avoid them. Either you think your|&s;elf le&s;s dangerous than you are, or me more firm than I pretend to be, when you beckon me to that couch."</Q>&mdash;He was proceeding, when &s;he &s;topt him, crying out&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Come, come, there is enough of this trifling; more than enough of this ridiculous, this unmanly affecta|tion. Beware how you provoke me; I &s;hall become de&s;perate if I am in&s;ulted."</Q> Regard|le&s;s of the&s;e menaces, Henry kept his po&s;t, and advanced not a &s;tep towards her. She kept her eyes fixed upon him, and exclaimed&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"By all the loves and graces, Henry, you have the form of an Apollo! wou'd to heaven you had his fire!

<P>This &s;aid, &s;he &s;tarted from the couch, and was advancing towards him, when, preventing her as &s;he was in the act of dropping on her knees, he cried, <Q REND="inline">"Pray, do not laugh at me; I cannot &s;tand your ridicule."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Vittoria!"</Q> &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline">"I've made the &s;ta|tue move and &s;peak. Now, &s;ince your marble maje&s;ty can bend, be pleas'd to &s;it be&s;ide me. Oh! all ye gods! it &s;miles, it animates, it yields, it &s;oftens with the touch; happy change! it lives! If the mere pre&s;&s;ure of the hand does this, my arms, perhaps, may warm it into love: I'll cla&s;p it to my heart, I'll breathe my life into its lips, and &s;hare my &s;oul between us."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Stop, Syren!"</Q> Henry exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"I'm not re&s;pon&s;ible for con&s;equences thus urg'd upon me, nor am I bound in honour to repair them: whil&s;t I believ'd your terrors in the &s;torm had thrown you from your natural guard, and &s;ubjected you to weakne&s;&s;es, which in a

more collected moment your virtue wou'd have &s;purn'd at, I felt my&s;elf a party in the trea&s;on, and tender'd you the only reparation in my power ('twas all I had to offer) my un|worthy &s;elf; but when you openly declare tho&s;e fears were feign'd, and freely take the blame upon your&s;elf, you quit me of the atonement; and now again, when you return to the attack, and with &s;uch exqui&s;ite allurements tempt a man, who vi&s;its you with none but honourable purpo&s;es, and combats again&s;t nature to pre|&s;erve you in that purity of character, which is your &s;ex's ornament, I think it fair to warn you that my &s;entiments re&s;pecting favours in anticipation differ &s;o e&s;&s;entially from your's, that &s;he, who has been mi&s;tre&s;s to me with her own con&s;ent, &s;hall never be my wife.

<P>How quick and &s;udden are the &s;hifts of pa&s;&s;ion! a word &s;ometimes will call up a new train of thoughts, and change our re&s;olutions in an in&s;tant. It was not virtue's &s;elf, but virtue's &s;ub&s;titute that &s;aved our hero; &s;unk into the arms of the &s;educer, and re&s;igned to

<P>IT was well for our hero that he had not many paces to mea&s;ure before he found an hou&s;e to take &s;helter in; for though he held his hand clo&s;e pre&s;&s;ed upon the wound, the &s;luice kept running apace, and his wa&s;te of blood would not have &s;uited a much longer march.

What cou'd po&s;|&s;e&s;s my child to &s;creen &s;o vile a wretch?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Be content,"</Q> replied Henry; <Q REND="inline">"he has met his doom at la&s;t; and you have now the com|fort to reflect, that by e&s;caping the puni&s;hment of the law, he has liv'd to repent, and, as far as human circum&s;tances will admit, to atone for the crime he has perpetrated: the &s;on, which that dark tran&s;action brought into the world, now &s;urvives to inherit the fortune of the father, and the injur'd mother is enabled to live ea&s;y and independent for the re&s;t of her days; and who &s;hall arraign her character?"</Q> He then concluded with what he knew would be the mo&s;t healing reflection he could &s;ugge&s;t to her, a&s;&s;uring her that even Ezekiel Daw, with all his purity and preci&s;ene&s;s, ab&s;olutely and entirely acquitted Su&s;an May, and had a&s;|&s;erted her innocence in the &s;tronge&s;t terms to the Rev. Mr. Claypole, in a conver&s;ation on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>As he was thus di&s;cour&s;ing, the cloud that had gathered upon her countenance cleared away, and the &s;hower it had been collecting began to vent it&s;elf at her eyes. Words were no longer wanting, but, like a &s;pring repre&s;&s;ed,

bur&s;t out with increa&s;ed volubility; they were the unpremeditated effu&s;ions of a heart over|charged with its own feelings; gratitude, a&s;to|ni&s;hment, joy, tran&s;ported her by turns from one to the other, yet &s;he found expre&s;&s;ions for them all, in broken &s;entences, after her man|ner, &s;o that it was &s;ome length of time whil&s;t Henry was fain to give patient hearing to her rhap&s;odies before he could perceive her &s;pirits to &s;ub&s;ide into any tolerable degree of calm|ne&s;s; and perhaps it was more owing to her being exhau&s;ted, than to any efforts on his part, when at la&s;t &s;he became quiet and compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>This interval, however, was but &s;hort; for &s;oon the recollection of his wound &s;eized her afre&s;h, and &s;he began to moan and lament over him more piteou&s;ly than at fir&s;t: her imagi|nation painted him expiring under the &s;tab of an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in; all his noble generous acts ro&s;e in review; accumulated obligations pre&s;&s;ed upon her memory with &s;uch overwhelming weight, that her grateful &s;oul &s;unk under it, and &s;he ca&s;t her&s;elf pro&s;trate at his feet, em|bracing them, and crying out, in broken ac|cents, <Q REND="inline">"The Lord of mercy &s;ave you! the widow's prayers protect and draw a ble&s;&s;ing on you, in return for all your bounteous good|ne&s;s,
<PB N="90" REF="96">
and for this your un&s;peakable tenderne&s;s in &s;oftening to my poor heart an event that wou'd el&s;e have broken it, had any other tongue but your's reveal'd this dreadful &s;ecret to me!"</Q></P>
<P>Here &s;he was called off by a me&s;&s;enger &s;ent in great ha&s;te from the vicarage to claim her in&s;tant a&s;&s;i&s;tance to Mi&s;s Claypole, who had been in &s;trong hy&s;terics &s;ince Henry had left her, and &s;o terrified the old woman, her only attendant, that, after rou&s;ing the cottagers at next door, &s;he had di&s;patched one of them to Dame May, as a per&s;on of &s;kill in &s;uch ca&s;es, and &s;tocked with medicines to relieve them. The dame had great &s;cruples about leaving her wounded friend; but Henry in&s;i&s;ting upon it, &s;he obeyed the &s;ummons, and departed, taking with her a competent provi&s;ion of &s;uch no&s;trums as &s;he judged proper for the occa|&s;ion.</P>
<P>In le&s;s than an hour &s;he returned, having left her patient in a convale&s;cent &s;tate; but in this period the hy&s;teric lady had in her ram|blings been &s;o communicative, that the good dame, who had at lea&s;t as much curio&s;ity as came to the &s;hare of any one individual, had perfectly informed her&s;elf of every particular that could elucidate the my&s;tery of our hero's

pretended accident: fraught with this informa|tion, &s;he &s;oon gave him to under&s;tand that &s;he was no longer impo&s;ed upon, though he &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in taking it upon him&s;elf as a chance blow in the &s;truggle, and that he was po&s;itive the lady had no &s;erious intention of doing any injury either to him or her&s;elf. As the dame, however, was &s;trenuous in unbelief, and he found him&s;elf rather faint and exhau&s;ted by lo&s;s of blood, he cut &s;hort the argument, by de&s;iring her to prepare Ezekiel's bed for his repo&s;e; but as he well knew her pa&s;&s;ion for telling news was not a whit inferior to her plea&s;ure in hearing it, he was very earne&s;t with her to keep &s;ecret what &s;he had heard from Fanny Claypole, or rather what &s;he her&s;elf &s;ugge&s;ted from the ramblings of a di&s;ordered imagination, &s;tating to her how extremely di&s;|honourable it would be in her, who acted in a medical capacity, to di&s;clo&s;e the &s;ecrets of a patient, which, he ob&s;erved, would be a heinous &s;in again&s;t the inviolable free-ma&s;onry of the faculty.</P>
<P>Henry retired to his repo&s;e with the plea&s;ing reflection that he had compounded a very heavy penalty with a &s;light fine, for &s;uch he now con&s;idered his wound to be; and indeed
<PB N="92" REF="98">
the pure habit of his body would have accom|modated it&s;elf to a demand of a more &s;erious nature than this was likely to prove; for the knife had only pierced the fle&s;hy part of his arm, without any material injury: neither was he the le&s;s happy in his pre&s;ent quarters for the te&s;timony which every thing about him bore to the ta&s;te and benignity of the beloved per&s;on who had provided them: every object he now looked upon, every comfort he en|joyed, was of I&s;abella's be&s;towing; and whil&s;t he fed on that delightful recollection, no won|der if the grateful approaches of &s;leep, &s;o &s;weetly recommended, &s;tole upon his &s;en&s;es with peculiar &s;oftne&s;s, till, by the magic of his dream, the air-drawn image of his beau|teous I&s;abella ro&s;e to view, graced with ten thou&s;and charms, and pictured to the heighth of fancy's warme&s;t colouring, kind, happy, greeting him with &s;miles of love, con&s;enting, melting into &s;oft de&s;ires, and &s;elf-&s;urrendered to his fond embrace.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER X. Our wounded Hero bleeds afre&s;h.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning Henry ro&s;e with re|cruited &s;trength: the air was &s;o fre&s;h, and the &s;un &s;o gay, that if we had any am|bition to emulate our brother noveli&s;ts in de|&s;cription, here is the very moment for it; but we decline the opportunity.</P>
<P>Dame May examin'd his wound, and per|ceiving that Dame Nature was in the humour to take the cure out of her hands, humbly re&s;igned the ta&s;k into her care, and contented her&s;elf with the &s;imple application of a fre&s;h pledget of dry lint, and &s;wath'd it as before. She now &s;et out her tea-table in its holiday trim, and admini&s;ter'd the ceremonies of breakfa&s;t in her very be&s;t &s;tile: when this &s;ervice was di&s;patch'd, &s;he left her gue&s;t in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her parlour, and addre&s;s'd her&s;elf to her own dome&s;tic affairs in another quarter.</P>
<P>She had not left him many minutes, when her lovely patrone&s;s &s;tept into the hou&s;e, un|&s;een by Henry;&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"It occurs to me,"</Q> &s;aid I&s;abella to the dame, <Q REND="inline">"that &s;omething may

be wanting in your friend Mr. Daw's apart|ment, and therefore I &s;hou'd be glad to look it over before he arrives."</Q>&mdash;Without &s;topping for an an&s;wer, &s;he nimbly a&s;cended the &s;tairs. The good dame's thoughts were rather from home at that moment, and not pre&s;ent to the recollection that Henry's bed-chamber was not exactly in a &s;tate fit to receive the vi&s;it of a young lady; in&s;tead therefore of &s;topping her on the &s;tairs, &s;he hobbled after her into the room;&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Heyday,"</Q> cried I&s;abella, upon looking about her, <Q REND="inline">"what is this? &s;omebody has &s;lept here I perceive."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Lackaday!"</Q> exclaimed the dame, <Q REND="inline">"I humbly a&s;k your pardon for not &s;topping you in time. Dear good young lady, be not offended with me; but indeed you was &s;o nimble, and took me, as I may &s;ay, at &s;uch a nonplus, that I never thought to tell you that the chamber was not fit for you to come into. Sure enough, though, it was my &s;weet dear young friend, Mr. Henry him&s;elf, who repo&s;ed him&s;elf in that bed la&s;t night, (Heaven ble&s;s him!) and I have not had lei&s;ure yet to &s;et the room to rights."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Did he &s;leep here?"</Q> &s;aid the lovely in|truder, as &s;he was quitting the chamber; and ju&s;t then recollecting that &s;he was leaving the

&s;urvey unfini&s;hed, which &s;he came to make, &s;topt and ca&s;t her eyes deliberately round the room, ob&s;erving that &s;he wi&s;h'd it was more worthy of her gue&s;t, <Q REND="inline">"But I hope at lea&s;t,"</Q> added &s;he, with an encouraging &s;mile, <Q REND="inline">"you took care to air it well for your friend and benefactor."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Heaven forbid!"</Q> cried Goody May, <Q REND="inline">"that I &s;hould bring his precious life into danger; there are wretches enough in this world too ready to do that, the more &s;hame their's; but I &s;ay nothing; the Lord he knows their hearts and mine al&s;o, how it bleeds for him at this moment; and that's the rea&s;on I was &s;o ab&s;ent in my duty to you.

Is Mr. Henry now in the hou&s;e?"</Q> Goody May an&s;wering in the affirmative, I&s;abella came &s;ilently down the &s;tairs, and un|der&s;tanding he was in the parlour, turned into the common room which was oppo&s;ite to it, making a &s;ign to her follower to do the &s;ame. Here &s;he immediately began a cour&s;e of que&s;tions, which &s;oon betrayed the communica|tive

dame into &s;o complete a recital of every circum&s;tance re&s;pecting Henry's wound, that nothing &s;he had collected from Mi&s;s Claypole in her fit, and which Henry had conjured her to keep &s;ecret, was untold. There is rea&s;on to believe, this poor woman wou'd have gone to death for Henry's &s;ake, whil&s;t &s;he was thus running counter to his injunctions; but to deny her&s;elf the plea&s;ure of broaching a piece of news, particularly one &s;o honourable to Henry, and &s;o intere&s;ting to the hearer, was a virtue which her nature could not reach; a &s;acrifice her re&s;olution was not equal to.</P>
<P>Henry, in the meanwhile, uncon&s;cious of what was pa&s;&s;ing &s;o near him, &s;ate in the little parlour with his eyes fixt upon the print of I&s;a|bella's father, that hung oppo&s;ite to him, pon|dering in his mind the lovely vi&s;ion of the pre|ceding night, his imagination fa&s;cinated with the contemplation of her matchle&s;s beauty, her engaging manners, and attractive graces, when behold the &s;ound of the lock drew his eyes to the door, which, gently opening, di&s;|clo&s;ed to his &s;ight the very object of his medi|tations in her exi&s;ting and &s;ub&s;tantial form, more exqui&s;itely beautiful than any &s;hade that fancy ever pictured in the poet's brain: &s;ur|prized,
<PB N="97" REF="103">
enraptured, he &s;tarted from his chair, and in the momentary tran&s;port that deprived him of reflection, ran and caught her in his arms: in&s;tantly undeceived, and convinced it was no &s;hadow he embraced, terrified at what he had done, he dropt upon his knee, and beg'd for pardon.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I was deceiv'd,"</Q> he cried; <Q REND="inline">"my mind had left me, and was &s;tray'd beyond realities: I &s;aw you in my medita|tions, and, like a man delirious, &s;eiz'd what in my better &s;en&s;es I would not offend for worlds, and know my&s;elf unworthy to approach."</Q></P>
<P>What pa&s;&s;ed in I&s;abella's mind, whil&s;t Henry was thus pleading for pardon at her feet, words will not de&s;cribe, for &s;he made u&s;e of none: it was not anger, for her looks were melting &s;oft; it could not but be mode&s;ty, for blu&s;hes &s;pread all over her fair face; no doubt but &s;en&s;ibility had a &s;hare in it, for tears be|dewed her cheeks.</P>
<P>He was preparing to proceed with his apo|logy, when a &s;hriek from I&s;abella &s;topt his &s;peech, and in&s;tantly he perceived the blood &s;treaming from his wound.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Behold,"</Q> he cried, <Q REND="inline">"how ju&s;tly I am brought to recollec|tion of my offence."</Q> I&s;abella, in the mean time, frightened pa&s;t the power of motion,

kept calling out for Goody May. It was ob|vious that her &s;udden appearance had &s;urpri&s;ed him into an exertion, that had opened his wound afre&s;h, when he incon&s;iderately threw his arms about her wa&s;te. The poor woman, terrified with what &s;he heard and &s;aw, in her confu&s;ion &s;carce knew what to do fir&s;t; but recollecting, after a few moments, the proce&s;s &s;he had before ob&s;erved, begged I&s;abella to a&s;&s;i&s;t in opening his coat &s;leeve, whil&s;t &s;he ha&s;tened to her repo&s;itory for means to &s;top the blood. I&s;abella, pale and trembling as &s;he was, &s;ummoned &s;pirits to a&s;&s;i&s;t in &s;upporting his arm, as well as in the operation of untying the tapes Goody May had &s;ewed upon his &s;leeve, which &s;he had ripped open over the wounded part. The bu&s;ine&s;s mo&s;t imme|diately nece&s;&s;ary was &s;oon effected by the ap|plication of fre&s;h lint and the former &s;typtic; but I&s;abella's horrors at the glimp&s;e &s;he had of his wound were not &s;o &s;oon di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. Henry's attention was &s;o totally ab&s;orbed in his care for his fair a&s;&s;i&s;tant, that he &s;eemed to have no &s;en&s;e of what was doing to him&s;elf, and he would fain have di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the opera|trix for hart&s;horn and water, before &s;he had &s;ecured the bandage; but when he felt the

gentle touch of I&s;abella, engaged in the work jointly with the old woman,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Who wou'd not gladly &s;hed his blood,"</Q> he cried, <Q REND="inline">"for &s;uch an honour?"</Q> and now a certain tender glance from I&s;abella's eyes made an&s;wer in &s;o flattering a language, that the heart of our hero, &s;o far from &s;inking under its lo&s;s, &s;eemed to beat with double energy and &s;pirit.</P>
<P>The hart&s;horn and water was now brought, I&s;abella recovered, and her alarm having &s;ub|&s;ided, the prudent dame thought her pre&s;ence was no longer nece&s;&s;ary, and retired.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"We look'd for you la&s;t night,"</Q> &s;aid I&s;abella; <Q REND="inline">"my father charg'd Su&s;an with a me&s;&s;age to that purpo&s;e, and to prevent mi&s;|takes I wrote you a &s;hort note; but I under|&s;tand from Su&s;an that you did not receive it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I hope,"</Q> replied he, fixing his eyes upon the floor, <Q REND="inline">"&s;he told you at the &s;ame time upon what motive I denied my&s;elf that hap|pine&s;s."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"She did,"</Q> rejoined I&s;abella; <Q REND="inline">"the letter I received from her this morning does credit to her heart and ju&s;tice to your honour, not only in the trifling matter of my note, but in a circum&s;tance of real &s;elf-denial, in which,
<PB N="100" REF="106">
permit me to &s;ay, you have given the noble&s;t proof of an exalted genero&s;ity."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If I merit your prai&s;e,"</Q> &s;aid Henry, <Q REND="inline">"in either in&s;tance, it is in that which you term the more trifling in&s;tance of the two: it is no hard ta&s;k for a man not mercenary to act as I did in the affair of Blachford, for it is a vic|tory over a mean and abject pa&s;&s;ion; but there is &s;ome &s;truggle to obey the dictates of honour, when it calls upon us to oppo&s;e the &s;tronge&s;t impul&s;e and affection that the heart can feel; but your commands to Su&s;an May were po&s;itive, and I obey'd them."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"They were calculated,"</Q> &s;he rejoined, <Q REND="inline">"for your accommodation; you had another en|gagement, and &s;olicitation is in that ca&s;e an embarra&s;&s;ment to a well-bred man."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"There,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"you lead me to look back upon a tran&s;action that covers me with confu&s;ion and &s;elf-reproach; yet, if it were a plea your purity might li&s;ten to, I have enough to &s;ay that wou'd acquit my con|&s;cience towards the engagement you allude to, though nothing can totally exculpate me from folly and infirmity. A fortunate explanation with Mi&s;s Claypole, ye&s;terday evening, has &s;et me free from all conditions of atonement,
<PB N="101" REF="107">
and I am happy it is in my power to a&s;&s;ert with truth, that the promi&s;e I held my&s;elf bound to make was not a compo&s;ition for the lo&s;s of innocence on her part, but &s;imply for the ri&s;que of reputation."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Whatever you &s;eriou&s;ly a&s;&s;ert,"</Q> I&s;abella replied, <Q REND="inline">"I implicitly believe; but when you call your explanation with that lady a fortu|nate one, I &s;hould &s;u&s;pect you are once more guilty of forgetting you have a wound, that demands more care and attention than you &s;eem di&s;pos'd to afford it. If you are to &s;hed your blood with &s;uch repeated profu&s;ion in every lady's company you chance upon, and one is to give, another to renew your wounds, I think you are in a likely way to become a victim to the &s;ex."</Q></P>

I have really thought at times, or fancy may have feign'd it, that you have a mark'd re&s;emblance in your air and features to my beloved Lady Crowbery, as I remember her &s;ome few years ago: this may be mere imagination; but I have humour'd my&s;elf in it the rather, becau&s;e it helps me naturally to account for certain &s;ituations I have &s;een her in with you, which el&s;e might &s;eem at variance with her &s;trict re&s;erve and delicacy of conduct: I can almo&s;t per&s;uade my&s;elf you are after &s;ome manner related to her; at lea&s;t the&s;e have been my idle reveries; but never did one

&s;yllable to that effect e&s;cape my lips till now; I am not quite &s;o fond of tatling as our good dame. And now, moreover, I recollect among&s;t the motives you enumerated for leaving us, you mention'd duty: be it &s;o! we mu&s;t con|form our&s;elves to duty; but let me hope that we &s;hall meet again."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And do you wi&s;h it?"</Q> &s;aid he, looking tenderly upon her.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Do I wi&s;h it?"</Q> &s;he re|peated.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Oh Henry! Henry! if that's a que&s;tion with you, where is your intelligence?"</Q>&mdash;Here the tears &s;topt her, and &s;he leant her forehead on his &s;houlder, covering her face with her handkerchief.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Heaven guard your life!"</Q> &s;he cried; <Q REND="inline">"may no female daemon ever more attempt it!

But you, thank Heaven, had virtue to re&s;i&s;t her, and virtue &s;ure, without a blu&s;h, may give the hand to virtue."</Q></P>
<P>This &s;aid, &s;he took his hand. The manner of the action &s;tamped it with the &s;eal of mo|de&s;ty,
<PB N="107" REF="113">
and mode&s;tly it was received, though love was the in&s;pirer: it was the &s;ilent contract of their hearts, pledged with the tender inter|change of &s;ighs and looks, that bade farewel, and vowed unalterable con&s;tancy: again &s;he pre&s;&s;ed his hand&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"And are you now con|vinc'd,"</Q> &s;he a&s;ked, <Q REND="inline">"how anxiou&s;ly I &s;hall wi&s;h for your return?

<HEAD>CHAPTER I. An Old Man's Prattle in a wintry Night.</HEAD>
<P>AS the &s;tate of &s;ociety becomes more re|fined, eccentricity of character wears away; a writer therefore of the pre&s;ent age, who aims to give amu&s;ing pictures of the hu|mours of the times, finds nature le&s;s favour|able to him in that re&s;pect than &s;he was to tho&s;e who re&s;orted to her for the like pur|po&s;es a century or two ago. This cannot be denied; but nature &s;till is inexhau&s;tible, and there is no need to emigrate from her domain in &s;earch of novelty and entertainment.</P>
<P>Originality of humour, or as it is more com|monly called, a new character, in play or novel, is the writer's fir&s;t aim, as it is &s;ure to be the fir&s;t in reque&s;t by every &s;pectator and critic, and the chief te&s;t by which his genius will be tried; but when we u&s;e the term originality as applied to the human character, we cannot be under&s;tood to mean a new creature, a be|ing
<PB N="110" REF="116">
formed by fancy, and not to be found in nature, but &s;imply a clo&s;e copy, a happy like|ne&s;s, of &s;ome &s;triking character, who&s;e pecu|liarities have a &s;trong effect, either in the moral or the humour of our compo&s;ition. The old drama abounds with per&s;onages of this &s;ort, and as the moulds in which they were ca&s;t are now de&s;troyed by time, we gaze upon them with &s;urpri&s;e and delight, regarding them as non-de&s;cripts, or creatures of a &s;eparate &s;pe|cies, though, at the time of their production, they were doubtle&s;s &s;ketched from nature; and it is po&s;&s;ible that the authors of that aera were not more applauded for their originality, than we of the pre&s;ent time are by our contempo|raries. When the critics therefore cry again&s;t the &s;tage as fallen off in its &s;pirit from the old ma&s;ters, and &s;eem to think we ought to exhi|bit as much novelty, and produce as much &s;ur|pri&s;e by living characters, as they do by rai&s;ing the dead, who are out of memory and for|gotten, they require of us a power, which, though the witch of Endor had, no modern poet now can boa&s;t; hence it follows, that &s;ome among&s;t us, who are indignant of re|proach, however unrea&s;onable, being hurried upon ra&s;h attempts, either &s;pend their talents
<PB N="111" REF="117">
in copying after copies, whil&s;t they aim to paint the manners as they were in times pa&s;t, or endeavouring to create the &s;ame &s;urpri&s;e by modern novelties, find them&s;elves carried out of nature and probability into the vi&s;ions of extravagance and romance. This in its con&s;equence brings di&s;grace upon the &s;tage, by reducing comedy into farce, and farce into puppet-&s;hew and pantomime: the noveli&s;t, in the mean time, breaking loo&s;e from &s;ociety, runs wild into fore&s;ts and de&s;erts, in &s;earch of caves and uninhabited ca&s;tles, where, forgetting every law of nature, and even every feature of the human countenance, he paints men and women &s;uch as never were in exi&s;tence, and then, amid&s;t the &s;hades of night and horror, rattles his chains, and conjures up his gho&s;ts, till having frightened his readers out of their &s;en&s;es, he vainly &s;uppo&s;es he has charmed them into applau&s;es.</P>
<P>But the evil does not &s;top here; for as a man, who runs mad about the &s;treets, will be followed by a mob, in like manner the rhodo|montade of the novel is copied by the non&s;en&s;e of the opera; and whil&s;t gho&s;ts glide over the &s;tage, thunders roll, and towers tumble, to the amu&s;ement of the galleries, the carpenter
<PB N="112" REF="118">
plays off his machinery to the roar of applaud|ing crowds, and the author, if he has any feel|ing for the dignity of his profe&s;&s;ion, blu&s;hes at his triumphs, when he reflects that they are founded on the di&s;grace of the theatre.</P>
<P>Let the author then beware how he is piqued into ab&s;urdities by his own vanity, or the fal&s;e ta&s;te of the public; if the genius that God has given him, and the matter that nature &s;upplies him with, will not &s;erve the purpo&s;e, let him drop the undertaking. If his imagi|nation can frame incidents, combine them well, and weave them naturally into a plea&s;ing fable, he has gained his point; but an over-anxiety to produce &s;ome &s;triking novelty will mo&s;t likely end in producing &s;ome &s;triking ab&s;urdity. All ranks of life are open to his choice, and he has a right to &s;elect the &s;tronge&s;t humours he can find; but if he does not find what &s;uits his purpo&s;e in nature, he has no excu&s;e for going out of it, whil&s;t he profe&s;&s;es to be a delineator of the living man|ners: fancy may ramble as &s;he likes, if &s;he avowedly beats about for imaginary beings; but if &s;he produces her own creations, and calls them men and women, or paints characters out of date, and pa&s;&s;es them upon us for con|temporaries,
<PB N="113" REF="119">
&s;he does more than &s;he has fair warrant and authority to do.</P>
<P>What I have here &s;aid of character is ap|plicable to incident: the writers of fiction are generally actuated by &s;o &s;trong a pa&s;&s;ion for the marvellous, that they &s;eem to throw every thing off the hinges, merely to alarm us with the din and clatter they make. Of all wretched expedients, which barren genius can re&s;ort to, the abrupt introduction of ca&s;ualties is one of the meane&s;t; in the novels of the pre&s;ent day, we encounter them at every turn, yet they never impo&s;e upon credulity; for when the &s;ick heroine at death's door threatens us with an exit, we are convinced &s;he does not mean to favour us with the performance of it. Surely there is no occa&s;ion for all this; neither is the impre&s;&s;ion very plea&s;ing which it conveys.</P>
<P>If that originality of character, which we have been &s;peaking of, is now become hardly attainable, di&s;crimination is yet within reach; and by a happy contra&s;t of leading characters, although they &s;hall not be really new, yet all the be&s;t effects of novelty may be obtained by an alternate play on each other's humours, by the means of which very comic and amu&s;ing
<PB N="114" REF="120">
&s;ituations may be &s;truck out. Among&s;t our countrymen, the great ma&s;ters of contra&s;t in our own day are Fielding and Sterne: Square and Thwackum, We&s;tern and his &s;i&s;ter, the father and the uncle of Tri&s;tram Shandy, are ad|mirable in&s;tances: Shak&s;peare had it from na|ture, Jon&s;on caught it from Ari&s;tophanes; Socrates and the Clown Strep&s;iades, in the comedy of The Clouds, is, perhaps, the mo&s;t brilliant contra&s;t of comic humour in the now-exi&s;ting records of the &s;tage, ancient or mo|dern.</P>
<P>Let me &s;uppo&s;e I am now &s;peaking to a young author, &s;itting down for the fir&s;t time to his maiden work. The fir&s;t thing nece&s;|&s;ary is to under&s;tand him&s;elf, the next, to know the age, in which he writes: when his nerves are fortified with a proper confidence in his own powers, let that confidence be tempered with all the re&s;pect, which is due to people of an enlightened under&s;tanding, who are to be his examiners and judges. It is a very &s;acred corre&s;pondence, that takes place between the mind of the author and the mind of the reader; it is not like the &s;light and ca&s;ual intercour&s;e we hold with our familiars and acquaintance, where any prattle &s;erves to
<PB N="115" REF="121">
fill up a few &s;ocial minutes, and &s;et the table in a roar; what we commit to our readers has no apology from hurry and inattention; it is the re&s;ult of thought well dige&s;ted, of &s;entiments by which we mu&s;t &s;tand or fall in reputation, of principles for which we mu&s;t be re&s;pon&s;ible to our contemporaries and to po&s;terity.</P>
<P>In the degree of entertainment our produc|tions may have the fortune to afford, our expectations may be pardonably mi&s;taken; but in what offends good morals, or &s;ins again&s;t the truth of nature, we err without excu&s;e; &s;elf-love cannot blind us in the&s;e re&s;pects, becau&s;e it is not a matter of talents, but of rectitude and common &s;en&s;e. We talk of critics as of men &s;et apart on purpo&s;e to annoy and cen&s;ure us; whereas every reader is a critic, and publi&s;hes his opinion of us where|ever he goes; we our&s;elves are critics in our turn, and what we complain of in our own per|&s;ons we do to others; and though few think it worth their while to publi&s;h their critici&s;ms, let it be remembered that &s;ome men's voices circulate further than other men's publica|tions.</P>
<P>Let us, therefore, who write, weigh well the duty of the ta&s;k we engage in, and let the
<PB N="116" REF="122">
puerile practice of invoking the mercy of our readers be no more thought of, for, ge|nerally &s;peaking, we are entitled to no more mercy than liberal-minded men will give us without our begging for it: I am aware of &s;ome exceptions, and am, I hope, as &s;en&s;itive towards &s;uch ca&s;es as I ought to be; but I am now &s;peaking generally of authors, who write for &s;ame, and not for bread. If the&s;e had all the diffidence they affect to have, how came it not to &s;tand in their way when they re&s;orted to the pre&s;s? And why this terror of the critics? An author cannot be harmed by a bad critic; and why &s;hould he be afraid of being benefitted by a good one?</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II. The be&s;t Friends mu&s;t part.</HEAD>
<P>WE clo&s;ed our la&s;t book with the parting of Henry and I&s;abella, in one of tho&s;e &s;ituations which we would rather refer to the reader's imagination than aim to de&s;cribe. Happily for him, his friendly ho&s;te&s;s gave no interruption to his meditations, nor did they
<PB N="117" REF="123">
wander from their beloved object, till the &s;ound of Lady Crowbery's wheels called him out to meet her. The chai&s;e was &s;topt at the gate of the cottage-garden, and her attendant got out by her lady's order, and &s;tept a&s;ide, whil&s;t Zachary and the nur&s;e, who occupied a hackney carriage, halted in the rear. When Henry's conver&s;ation with his mother was over, and they had parted, he engaged the driver of Zachary's chai&s;e to take him back to Crowbery on his return, which was accord|ingly done, and he once more found him&s;elf in the ho&s;pitable cottage with his friend Ezekiel.</P>
<P>To him he purpo&s;ed to dedicate the remain|der of that day, and the next morning to join the &s;hip, according to the notice he had re|ceived from Captain Cary. Upon his arrival, he found that Blachford had breathed his la&s;t, and Su&s;an May, with her infant, had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his quarters at the cottage; he therefore determined upon going on that even|ing to the port, and to wait no longer than till a chai&s;e could be brought from the neighbouring po&s;t town. When he had pa&s;t &s;ome time with Su&s;an and hone&s;t Daw, in di&s;cour&s;ing on their affairs, and had contrived to &s;atisfy their
<PB N="118" REF="124">
anxiety about his wound, with as little violence to truth as the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of Mi&s;s Claypole's name would admit of, a tap at the door an|nounced a vi&s;itor, when young Tom Weevil pre&s;ented him&s;elf, clad in his be&s;t apparel, carrying a wallet or knap&s;ack at the end of a crooked &s;tick upon his &s;houlder, with a cut|la&s;s &s;lung in a buff belt round his wa&s;te.</P>
<P>The preacher, &s;eeing an armed man enter his hou&s;e, &s;tarted from his &s;eat, and marching up to him with an intrepid air, cried out, <Q REND="inline">"What aile&s;t thou, Thomas Weevil, that thou ha&s;t armed thy&s;elf in this fa&s;hion? &s;peak, is it peace, Jehu?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"With your leave, Doctor Daw,"</Q> replied the young miller, <Q REND="inline">"my bu&s;ine&s;s is with the gentleman there, and not with you."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Render up your purpo&s;e to my ears, Thomas Weevil,"</Q> repeated Ezekiel, <Q REND="inline">"for thou &s;halt not pa&s;s me to approach my gue&s;t, until thou ha&s;t an&s;wered to my que&s;tion; Is it peace?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I know not what you mean by your que&s;tion,"</Q> quoth Tom, <Q REND="inline">"for be it peace or be it war, all's one to me, &s;eeing that I am come to tender my &s;ervices to Mr. Henry, who, I under&s;tand, is going over &s;ea to foreign coun|tries; and as I bear, do you &s;ee, in grateful mind, that he has &s;av'd my life, I think it but

ju&s;t and right to ri&s;que it in his &s;ervice; and &s;o I am here ready to follow him to the world's end; that's all, Ma&s;ter Zekiel, I have to &s;ay."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And thou ha&s;t &s;aid well, friend Thomas,"</Q> quoth Ezekiel, <Q REND="inline">"therefore pa&s;s in peace, and make thy&s;elf welcome with a cup of my be&s;t ale, which I will forthwith admini&s;ter unto thee."</Q> So &s;aying, the good man went out, on <HI>ho&s;pitable thoughts intent.</HI></P>
<P>At the &s;ame time old Weevil made his ap|pearance, and repeated to Henry the &s;ame tender, in nearly the &s;ame terms, adding, that he had given his free con&s;ent to Tom's de|parture, for, God be thank'd, he had &s;ons enough left to keep the mill going the whil&s;t. <Q REND="inline">"Tom,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"has play'd a little loo&s;e to be &s;ure, but he has &s;een his error, and that is every thing.

<P>Henry now, having given his hand to the father fir&s;t, and afterwards to the &s;on, expre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf very &s;en&s;ibly affected by the offer they had

made him. He was going out, he told them, with a gallant captain, in a &s;hip of war, who might po&s;&s;ibly fall in with an enemy before he found his port&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"and who can tell,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"where an unlucky &s;hot may glance? I &s;hou'd be &s;orry therefore to expo&s;e my friend Tom to broken bones, tho' I know him to be a brave fellow."</Q> To this Tom replied, that he de&s;pis'd danger in his &s;ervice; that he was ready to &s;hare his fortune by &s;ea and by land; that he had got his father's leave, and had a longing de&s;ire to &s;ee the world; in &s;hort, that it wou'd break his heart if Henry wou'd not permit him to go with him. This was again &s;econded by old Weevil, when Ezekiel, ri&s;ing up, and putting him&s;elf into his accu&s;tomed po&s;ture, took up his parable as follows:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Thy zeal, young man, to &s;hare the fortune of him, who, under Providence, was the pre|&s;erver of thy life, indicates a grateful mind, and I commend thee therefore; and thou, &s;on Henry, mu&s;t no longer oppo&s;e the laudable de&s;ire, which this youth hath expre&s;s'd, of de|voting him&s;elf to thy &s;ervice, &s;eeing it is no le&s;s a part of genero&s;ity, in &s;ome ca&s;es, to receive an obligation, than to be&s;tow one: it &s;ufficeth that thou ha&s;t ingenuou&s;ly forewarn'd Thomas
<PB N="121" REF="129">
Weevil of the dangers he may chance to incur in the cour&s;e of thy peregrination. And verily I am my&s;elf at this moment in no &s;mall &s;trait, having fully purpo&s;ed not to &s;uffer thee to depart alone, but to bear thee company in thy travels in pure affection of heart, knowing thee to be of a bold adventurous &s;pirit, which pu&s;heth thee into dangers; the&s;e, if by coun&s;el and experience I cou'd not avert, I might at lea&s;t have &s;har'd, being re&s;olute to go with thee, if need requir'd, even unto death. But now behold the corp&s;e of Mr. Blachford lieth yet unburied, and having been the happy means of turning him from the error of his ways, can I fail to attend his body to the grave, and not be pre&s;ent to put up a prayer for the repo&s;e of his &s;oul? And lo! here is the dam&s;el al&s;o, who hath &s;uffer'd violence by him, and who&s;e heart now faileth her through fear of &s;lander, needeth one to con&s;ole her and &s;upport: who then but my&s;elf, the friend of her mother the widow, and witne&s;s to the confe&s;&s;ion of her &s;educer, who was once a &s;on of Belial, excu&s;ing her and accu&s;ing him&s;elf, is &s;o fitted to that labour of love? The&s;e, not to mention the care of her worldly affairs, which lieth on me, are among&s;t the calls by which

the trouble of my heart is enlarged, when I reflect that I mu&s;t &s;uffer thee, &s;on Henry, to depart alone; yet not alone, if &s;o be this friendly youth, who&s;e grateful tender of him&s;elf I do exhort thee to accept, &s;hall be thy companion by the way. And now &s;eeing the hour of thy departure approacheth, and the evening draweth on, I mu&s;t be brief, as is my manner of &s;peech, &s;aying only tho&s;e things which it were a &s;hame to omit, and praying the Lord of all mercy to pre&s;erve thee in all thy goings, be&s;eeching him to di&s;po&s;e thy heart to continue &s;tedfa&s;t in his fear and love amid&s;t all the temptations of this &s;inful world, and in his good time to return thee and this thy com|panion &s;afe and unhurt to your rejoicing friends."</Q></P>
<P>The good man having concluded his ha|rangue, lifted the pitcher to his lips, and drank a farewell to his parting gue&s;ts, for Henry's chai&s;e had now come up to the door. Tom Weevil, who&s;e offer was accepted joyfully, be|&s;tirred him&s;elf in &s;towing Henry's baggage and his own upon the carriage; and now the mo|ment came when our hero, taking Ezekiel's hands in his, tenderly addre&s;&s;ed him in the&s;e words&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Farewell, my worthy friend; where|ever

To this your be&s;t of benefactors you owe the duty of a daughter, and you will not fail to pay it, for to his pious exhortations it is owing, that the father of your child was brought to a &s;en&s;e of the injuries he had done you, and induced to atone for them; at the &s;ame time take notice, that this excellent creature &s;uffer'd not one &s;hilling of the deceas'd to adhere to his fingers, notwith&s;tanding every offer which, to my know|ledge,

<P>In the mean time &s;ilence reigned in the cot|tage: Ezekiel committed him&s;elf to his wicker-chair, and remained in pen&s;ive meditation: Su|&s;an &s;eated her&s;elf by his &s;ide, and as he re&s;ted his hand upon the arm of his chair, pre&s;&s;ed her lips upon it, and bathed it in her tears: old Weevil felt an aching in his throat, and ap|plied him&s;elf to the pitcher without uttering a word. Ezekiel &s;eeing this, rou&s;ed him&s;elf in his &s;eat, and cried, though in a faultering voice, <Q REND="inline">"Courage, neighbour, we have only parted from our friends, we have not lo&s;t them."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"No, no,"</Q> cried the miller, as he took the pitcher from his lips; <Q REND="inline">"to be &s;ure, as you &s;ay, we have not to mourn over the lo&s;s of them, but &s;omehow or other it makes one feel a little
<PB N="125" REF="133">
queer; for, as nobody can be &s;ure of life for an hour to come, parting methinks is, as I may &s;ay, like taking leave for ever."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Hea|ven, in its mercy, forbid that,"</Q> cried Su&s;an, and bur&s;t aloud into an agony of grief.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Child, child,"</Q> &s;aid Ezekiel, <Q REND="inline">"moderate thy wailing; it becometh not us to give way to inordinate grief: what ha&s;t thou lo&s;t which I have not lo&s;t, and do&s;t thou &s;ee me give way to this un&s;eemly weakne&s;s? why do&s;t thou not take example by me? thou &s;ee&s;t, dam&s;el, that I am firm and un&s;haken."</Q> Here his voice began to quiver, and he &s;eemed fighting again&s;t &s;omething that ro&s;e in his throat, and would not &s;uffer him to proceed. <Q REND="inline">"I know,"</Q> cried Su&s;an, <Q REND="inline">"we &s;hould not anticipate affliction, but when a dreadful image is pre&s;ented to my imagina|tion, how can I forbear to feel a horror at the thoughts of lo&s;ing &s;uch a friend for ever?

<HEAD>CHAPTER III. Our Hero goes out to Sea.</HEAD>
<P>PUNCTUAL to his appointment, Miller Weevil pre&s;ented him&s;elf, by break of day, at the door of Ezekiel's ca&s;tle, where, having &s;eated the apo&s;tle by his &s;ide, directly over the
<PB N="129" REF="137">
axletree of a vehicle, which, if it had been con&s;tructed profe&s;&s;edly as an in&s;trument of torture, might have done credit to the inge|nious cruelty of its inventor, he &s;et forward on a round trot, jolting him over ruts and rocks with a mercile&s;s indifference the &s;traite&s;t way to his point, till they came in view of the &s;ea, with the frigate riding at anchor. Eze|kiel, who now &s;aw a period to the per&s;ecution he had endured for two long hours, took cou|rage, and being ju&s;t then in a &s;andy pa&s;s, availed him&s;elf of the fir&s;t moment he could venture to put his tongue to any u&s;e, having wi&s;ely kept it &s;till whil&s;t his teeth were in mo|tion: the &s;cene was magnificent; the &s;un, which was flaming in their rear, threw a gleam of &s;plendour over the &s;hore, the &s;hip and the expan&s;e of waters, that terminated the pro&s;pect. Objects like the&s;e could not fail to carry up Ezekiel's thoughts to the Creator of all things; in his &s;oul Devotion, eagle-winged, &s;ate ever ready to catch the &s;ignal for &s;oaring in its flight towards Heaven; accordingly he began, in a lofty cadence, to rehear&s;e that portion of the 107th p&s;alm, which begins <Q REND="inline">"<HI>They that go down to the &s;ea in &s;hips.</HI>"</Q> His charioteer in the mean while, &s;truck with the awful &s;train, re&s;pectfully
<PB N="130" REF="138">
&s;lackened his pace and li&s;tened in &s;ilence, pon|dering the fate of his &s;on, then floating on the &s;urface of that tremendous ocean, in the mercy of Him <Q REND="inline">"<HI>at who&s;e word the &s;tormy wind ari&s;eth.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>When Ezekiel cea&s;ed his recitation, Weevil ob&s;erved that the words were very fine, though he was pretty &s;ure he had heard them be|fore. <Q REND="inline">"I believe thou ha&s;t,"</Q> quoth Ezekiel, <Q REND="inline">"if thou did&s;t ever hear the p&s;alms."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"If &s;o,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"I wi&s;h you wou'd double down the leaf for &s;on Thomas, for I think every man who goes to &s;ea &s;hou'd have the fear of God before his eyes."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"And whither &s;hou'd any man go without it?"</Q> &s;aid Ezekiel; and im|mediately &s;truck into that enraptured pa&s;&s;age of the &s;ame &s;ublime min&s;trel, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Whither &s;hall I go then from thy &s;pirit,</HI>" &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>This again drew the profounde&s;t attention from Weevil, who, at the conclu&s;ion, expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf very highly delighted with what he had heard, ob&s;erving, that he firmly believed it all, and that no man could commit a bad action &s;afely, for that God's eyes were every where; <Q REND="inline">"and I make no doubt,"</Q> added he, <Q REND="inline">"but that villain Bow&s;ey, tho' he has got out of our reach, will fall into the hands of ju&s;tice &s;ooner or later, and pay &s;auce for his wickedne&s;s in the end;
<PB N="131" REF="139">
and as I hold him to be a murderer all one as if Tom had died under his hand, I don't de|&s;pair of &s;eeing him brought to the gallows in God's good time."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Neighbour Weevil,"</Q> replied Ezekiel, <Q REND="inline">"it is not in the death, but in the conver&s;ion of a &s;inner that our God de|lighteth, and thou, taking pattern from his mercy, &s;hould&s;t ab&s;tain from vengeance, &s;ee|ing it belongeth not to thee, but to him alone. Forbear, therefore, to wi&s;h for the puni&s;hment of that runnagate, wi&s;h rather for his repent|ance. Do all things, my friend, in love and charity to all men; give thy heart to him that de&s;erves it, thy help to all that &s;tand in need of it. Remember that the law tries our ac|tions, but God judges our thoughts. There is a rule, &s;hort, ea&s;y, equitable&mdash;<HI>Do as you would be done by,</HI> and you cannot do wrong."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Why that's exactly the rule I follow,"</Q> &s;aid the miller; <Q REND="inline">"if a man does me a good turn, I requite him with one as good; if he does me an ill one, I pay him in his own coin; and if he robs and plunders me, like that villain Bow&s;ey, I wi&s;h to &s;ee him hang'd; that's my way, and I believe it's very natural."</Q></P>
<P>Weevil was not famous for drawing right conclu&s;ions, and Ezekiel would hardly have
<PB N="132" REF="140">
failed to convince him of it, had not he ju&s;t then turned into his inn-yard, under the &s;ign of the &s;hip, where he was in&s;tantly acco&s;ted by his &s;on Thomas, who had ju&s;t come off from the &s;hip to procure &s;ome things that Henry had occa&s;ion for: one of the frigate's boats was waiting for him, and his job would be di&s;patched in half an hour, when he would go with them on board, where Henry was. This interval Weevil propo&s;ed to fill up with a good breakfa&s;t; for whatever his companion might think of the matter, he at lea&s;t recol|lected that he had come away from home fa&s;t|ing.</P>
<P>There was a fellow in the kitchen, belong|ing to the boat, who called him&s;elf the cap|tain's cock&s;wain, who made him&s;elf known to our travellers upon hearing them &s;ay they were going on board; he had been taking leave of a nymph of the &s;hore, who went by the dubious title of his wife, and indeed it may well be que&s;tioned if that honourable and happy title was more than nominal; &s;he was however in tears, and Jack was comforting her and him&s;elf with a gla&s;s of brandy, whil&s;t he repeated to her in a lamentable tone his part|ing vows, interlarding them with a continual re|petition
<PB N="133" REF="141">
of <Q REND="inline">"Only be true to me, Poll;"</Q> and clenching his promi&s;es of reciprocal fidelity with oaths of &s;o peculiar a &s;ort, as made Eze|kiel &s;tare with a&s;toni&s;hment, though he hardly knew what interpretation to put upon them. At la&s;t, when the fellow had pretty well di&s;|po&s;ed of every particle about him&s;elf to &s;ome devil or other, to hold in pledge for his con|&s;tancy to his beloved mate, Ezekiel, though in clo&s;e action at that moment with the &s;alted buttock of an ox, laid down his knife and fork, and began to take the &s;wearer to ta&s;k. <Q REND="inline">"Friend,"</Q> &s;aid Ezekiel, <Q REND="inline">"thou ha&s;t talk'd in &s;o loud a tone that thou ha&s;t made us hearers of thy conver&s;ation whether we wou'd or not; I per|ceive with regret that in the mid&s;t of thy afflic|tion at parting from thy &s;pou&s;e, thou ha&s;t exhort|ed her to con&s;tancy frequently, and in &s;uch a manner as argues a &s;u&s;picion of her fidelity to thee in thine ab&s;ence: what cau&s;e thou ha&s;t to hold in doubt the virtue of the wife of thy bo&s;om I cannot tell, as thou ha&s;t &s;tated no actual charge again&s;t her; but I &s;hou'd hope the young wo|man hath not enter'd into the holy &s;tate of wedlock without weighing and perpending the duties of a wife, and al&s;o what a heinous &s;in it is to violate the nuptial bed: if &s;he knoweth
<PB N="134" REF="142">
this, what need is there for thy &s;o frequent re|petitions on a ca&s;e &s;o clear? if &s;he knoweth it not, I am here ready to in&s;truct her in her ma|trimonial offices to the be&s;t of my abilities."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Are you &s;o? you be damn'd,"</Q> cried the &s;ailor, eyeing him from head to foot with the mo&s;t &s;overeign contempt; <Q REND="inline">"I'll tell you what, brother, 'twill be the wor&s;t job you ever took in hand in your life. You, indeed! you, with tho&s;e lantern jaws, pretend to talk to my Poll; you, with that lank carca&s;e, for all the world like the pur&s;er's &s;hirt upon a hand-&s;pike."</Q> And now the lady, no le&s;s irritated than her &s;poke&s;man, joined her treble to the ba&s;e, over|whelming poor Ezekiel with a torrent of words not the mo&s;t courtly, in a key not the mo&s;t harmonious, whil&s;t he &s;tood &s;taring with a&s;toni&s;hment on them both, yielding however no one inch of ground from the po&s;t he had taken, nor from the upright attitude in which he &s;tood, con&s;cious of having given no offence, &s;ave that his zeal had innocently intruded a kind offer where it was not called for. But &s;oon the din became general; for Weevil, the miller, had now turned out on the part of his friend, whil&s;t the landlady, who exerted her voice for peace and &s;ilence, roared louder, and
<PB N="135" REF="143">
with more fury than the parties them&s;elves, who were vociferous enough in the controver&s;y without her help. When this confu&s;ion was at the heighth, and the &s;ailor, now rou&s;ed, like the lion, with his own roar, was become ferocious, thundering out his oaths by whole broad&s;ides at a volley, a &s;tripling youth, or rather boy, in the uniform of a mid&s;hipman, &s;tepping up to him, and catching hold of a button of his jacket, cried out in a &s;hrill ema&s;culate voice,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"What's here to do with you, ra&s;cal? hold your jaw and jump aboard, you lubber, or I'll make you change your doxy for the gunner's daughter."</Q></P>
<P>Silence in&s;tantly en&s;ued.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Aye, aye, Sir!"</Q> cried the &s;ailor, gave a &s;hrug, pulled up his trow&s;ers, and was off like a &s;hot.</P>
<P>The young&s;ter a&s;ked the landlady if the fel|low had left any thing unpaid; and being told there was nothing on the &s;core but a &s;hilling for the brandy he and the lady had been drink|ing, he immediately di&s;charged it, intimating to the afore&s;aid lady, that no more women would be admitted on board, as the frigate would weigh with the next tide.</P>
<P>Ezekiel contemplated this in&s;tance of di&s;|cipline with &s;urprize and admiration: the
<PB N="136" REF="144">
boyi&s;h age and per&s;on of the officer carried &s;o little authority in appearance, that he could &s;carce account for the immediate effect it took upon the boi&s;terous &s;pirit of the &s;ailor, and the obedience it produced.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Truly, young gen|tleman,"</Q> he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"there mu&s;t be admirable order on board your &s;hip, when an unruly na|ture can be &s;o readily controul'd by a gentle one."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I believe, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid the boy, <Q REND="inline">"we are as well off in that re&s;pect as our neigh|bours; Captain Cary &s;upports his officers, and I fancy that's the &s;ure&s;t way to keep the men in order."</Q>&mdash;Ezekiel then enquired after his friend on board, &s;aid that he had come for the purpo&s;e of paying him a &s;hort vi&s;it before he &s;ailed, and civilly reque&s;ted permi&s;&s;ion to be pa&s;&s;ed to the &s;hip in his boat.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Mo&s;t readi|ly,"</Q> &s;aid this young commander; <Q REND="inline">"I am only waiting for a man who is on &s;hore on that gen|tleman's bu&s;ine&s;s, and I &s;hall be off directly."</Q> At that in&s;tant Tom Weevil entered the kitch|en, and the miller having paid the reckon|ing, Ezekiel with the father and &s;on, under conduct of their warlike leader, proceeded to the beach, where the boat was manned and waiting. There was a heavy &s;well &s;et in by the oppo&s;ition of wind and tide, and further
<PB N="137" REF="145">
out a bar, on which the &s;ea broke in a manner not a little formidable to a land&s;man's eyes: the frigate was at anchor about two miles with|out this bar; Ezekiel and old Weevil were placed in the &s;tern-&s;heets, Tom took his po&s;t at the bow, and the noi&s;y fellow, now in office as cock&s;wain, took his &s;eat in the &s;teerage, as perfectly under command of his beardle&s;s officer, as if the admiral of the fleet had been on board the boat. If Ezekiel was &s;truck with &s;urprize at the authority of the young&s;ter on &s;hore, he was &s;till more &s;o with his addre&s;s and &s;kill in manoeuvring the boat through a &s;ea, which he conceived was every in&s;tant about to whelm them in the waves. The miller, who was as much a novice in naviga|tion as the preacher, exhibited &s;trong &s;ymp|toms of alarm, jumping up once or twice in the boat, for which he was very properly re|primanded by the young&s;ter, who ridiculed his fears, telling him if he was afraid of being &s;wamp'd, he went the very way to bring it about. Ezekiel, on the contrary, &s;ate &s;till and kept a &s;teady countenance, not that he did not think he was at the la&s;t cri&s;is of his fate, but becau&s;e he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a mind tranquillized by religion, and perfectly re&s;igned to that all-di|recting
<PB N="138" REF="146">
Being, to whom his mental ejacula|tions were then &s;ilently addre&s;&s;ed. When they had &s;truggled for &s;ome time on the bar, with lu&s;ty &s;inews and <HI>hearts of controver&s;y,</HI> the young officer giving his orders with perfect firmne&s;s and preci&s;ion, and all voices were hu&s;hed, but the &s;hrill &s;mall pipe of a child, he cried to the cock&s;wain&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Mind your helm and be damn'd to you! Steer &s;teady; now, lads, give way all, and we are clear."</Q>&mdash;The energy was in&s;tantaneous; what cannot Briti&s;h &s;ailors do? the boat was driven through the waves, the bar was pa&s;&s;ed, and they found them&s;elves at once in deep water and a &s;moother &s;ea: the little mid&s;hipman now bade them &s;tep the ma&s;t and hoi&s;t the &s;ail; they &s;hot before the wind, and quickly were along-&s;ide of the frigate. The humanity of this young&s;ter gave orders for taking care of Ezekiel and old Weevil, as they awkwardly &s;crambled up the &s;ide; a lieu|tenant &s;tood upon the gunwhale, giving orders about &s;ome fre&s;h beef and other &s;tores they had brought off in the cutter; and Ezekiel had another call upon his wonder and &s;urprize, when he heard this lieutenant &s;ay to the young officer of the boat&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"You have had a good tuzzle on the bar, Lord Frederick."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"So,
<PB N="139" REF="147">
&s;o,"</Q> replied Lord Frederick, and immediately taking off his hat, whil&s;t he addre&s;&s;ed his &s;u|perior officer, informed him that the&s;e two gen|tlemen wi&s;hed to &s;peak to Mr. Fitzhenry. The an&s;wer was, that he was then in the cabin under the &s;urgeon's hands, but if the gentle|mens' bu&s;ine&s;s was urgent, he would direct them to be &s;hewn the way to him. Ezekiel expre&s;&s;ing a de&s;ire to be in&s;tantly admitted to his friend, was put under the guidance of a marine, whil&s;t old Weevil went a&s;ide with Tom to his quarters.</P>
<P>When Ezekiel entered the cabin, he found Henry with his arm &s;tripped, and the &s;urgeon cleaning his wound; a kind &s;alutation was all the&s;e friends could interchange in their pre&s;ent circum&s;tances.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"This gentleman,"</Q> &s;aid Henry, <Q REND="inline">"who is the &s;urgeon of the &s;hip, is &s;o kind to take in hand this paltry &s;cratch, and I a&s;&s;ure you, he gives a very hand&s;ome te&s;ti|mony to our good dame's performances."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"A &s;cratch, do you call it?"</Q> cried Ezekiel, knitting his brow, <Q REND="inline">"it is a perilous &s;tab! I prote&s;t I did not think by your account it had been any thing like this:"</Q>&mdash;then addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the &s;urgeon, he added,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I pray you, learned Sir, what is your opinion of this
<PB N="140" REF="148">
ugly ga&s;h?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"My opinion is,"</Q> cried the &s;urgeon, <Q REND="inline">"that had it not been in the direc|tion where fortunately it is, it might have been an ugly ga&s;h indeed; but as it is, I think it will be well in a few more dre&s;&s;ings."</Q>&mdash;This he &s;aid without looking at Ezekiel, being then employed in applying a compre&s;s to the wound before he bound it up: having done this, he looked round for the &s;peaker, whom he no &s;ooner &s;et eyes on, than he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Is it you, Mr. Daw? I am very glad to &s;ee you."</Q>&mdash;Eze|kiel &s;tared upon him for a moment, then marching up to him, and taking him cordially by the hand, exclaimed,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"As I live, it is my old friend and favourite, Billy Williams: ne|ver tru&s;t me, but I rejoice to &s;ee thee in the land of the living, Mr. Williams; heartily I rejoice at thy well-doing, for I have much bewail'd thy &s;udden di&s;appearance from a|mong&s;t us, e&s;teeming thee very truly for thy towardly di&s;po&s;ition and good qualities, no le&s;s than for thy talents. If I mi&s;take not, it is now going on to two years &s;ince you quitted neighbour Cawdle, and we knew not whither you went?"</Q>&mdash;This &s;atisfied Henry's curio&s;ity &s;o far, and as they proceeded in their conver|&s;ation, Williams filled up the interval with an

account of him&s;elf in various &s;hips to the pre|&s;ent time, when having done his bu&s;ine&s;s with Henry, and an&s;wered all Ezekiel's enquiries, he re&s;pectfully took his leave and retired. And now our hero and his friend being left to them&s;elves, had a conference of at lea&s;t half an hour without interruption, when Captain Cary entered the cabin, who very kindly welcomed Ezekiel upon Henry's introduction of him: he lamented he could not a&s;k him to dinner, as they were then weighing anchor, and &s;hould be out to &s;ea. <Q REND="inline">"We mu&s;t think therefore,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"how to get you on &s;hore:"</Q> and the fir&s;t lieutenant then entering the cabin, he de&s;ired him to hail the tender along-&s;ide of them, and a&s;k the loan of their boat to &s;et Ezekiel and his friend Weevil on &s;hore.

<P>THE tender's boatmen hawled off from the &s;hip a few lengths, and then laid on their oars, and cheered the frigate, who now began to feel her &s;ails and make way through the water: this rou&s;ed Ezekiel from his tor|por, and in&s;tantly his ears were a&s;&s;ailed by three repeated cheers, in a much louder key from the whole crew of the tender, who had manned &s;hip in compliment to Captain Cary: the frigate's crew returned the in&s;piring com|pliment, and then pre&s;enting her &s;tern to the

<P><Q REND="inline">"Hurrah! my hearts,"</Q> cried the man in the &s;teerage, the boat cut through the water.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"There &s;he goes,"</Q> looking at the frigate, &s;aid one of the fellows at his oar.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Damn me, but I wi&s;h I was in her,"</Q> repeated a &s;e|cond.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Have you then a friend,"</Q> &s;aid Eze|kiel, <Q REND="inline">"on board that &s;hip, whom you regret to part from? and is your heart agoniz'd with grief like mine?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Grief indeed!"</Q> cried the fellow, in a &s;urly tone; <Q REND="inline">"grief never came near my heart &s;ince I had one: I wi&s;h my&s;elf in her becau&s;e I think &s;he has a fighting cap|tain on board, and there'll be &s;omething to be got to make merry with on &s;hore: but belike you are tender-hearted, and take on becau&s;e your friend is gone to &s;ea; if that be the ca&s;e, do you mind me, do as I do, when I part from my wife, &s;wab the &s;pray out of your glims, and think no more about it."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I can|not be &s;ure that I clearly under&s;tand thee, friend,"</Q> replied Ezekiel, <Q REND="inline">"but I pre&s;ume it

<P>As this did not reach the under&s;tanding of the tar, it produced no an&s;wer, and what|ever want of feeling in Ezekiel's &s;en&s;e of it there might be in tho&s;e he had embarked with, there was &s;uch &s;trength and alacrity, that our pa&s;&s;engers &s;oon found them&s;elves &s;afely landed on their native &s;oil. A can of grog to the crew, and a &s;light refre&s;hment for Weevil and Ezekiel, to revive languid nature, filled up the time, whil&s;t the miller's cart was getting ready, which at length &s;afely landed our travellers at Ezekiel's door, and not without many of tho&s;e jars and jumbles emblematic of the troubles in|&s;eparably attendant on our pa&s;&s;age through life.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t Henry was now wafted into the ocean, and whil&s;t the land he had left was &s;inking in the horizon of his pro&s;pect, the tender heart of his beloved I&s;abella had di|rected many a &s;igh to attend him over the watery wa&s;te. Lady Crowbery had arrived at Man&s;tock Hou&s;e, le&s;s exhau&s;ted with her fir&s;t &s;tage than could rea&s;onably be expected: Sir Roger, I&s;abella, Zachary Cawdle, every &s;oul male and female in the family, were in motion to attend upon her, nor did the reve|rend

Mr. Claypole fail to be among&s;t the forwarde&s;t to exhibit his devoirs: Fanny, meanwhile, remained in &s;ullen &s;olitude at the vicarage, her mind experiencing the various torments &s;lighted pa&s;&s;ion is expo&s;ed to. Her &s;ecret was entombed in I&s;abella's brea&s;t; in that of Goody May it had a more precarious tenure; yet for the pre&s;ent &s;he adhered to the injunctions &s;he had received, and held her tongue. Lady Crowbery had remarked the condition of Henry's arm, but had taken up with the &s;light account he had given of it, the rather becau&s;e &s;he perceived he had a ready u&s;e of it. Little, however, was &s;aid upon the &s;ubject whil&s;t the family were about her, and I&s;abella did not think it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;peak of the interview &s;he had had at the dame's.</P>
<P>When dinner was over, and Lady Crow|bery's &s;pirits &s;eemed recruited by her repa&s;t and the company of her friends, an opportu|nity was taken by Sir Roger to introduce a &s;ubject, which he knew his friend Mr. Clay|pole to have much at heart, and which he opened, by enquiring if &s;he had filled up Mr. Ratcliffe's vacancy.

This, I dare &s;ay, is your doctrine in the pulpit, Mr. Clay|pole, for I don't doubt your orthodoxy; but, allow me to &s;ay, it was his al&s;o in the clo&s;et; this he inculcated to Henry, whom he father'd, and who has nobly practis'd what he taught, by giving up the whole of Blachford's fortune to the &s;on of Blachford: this you condemn'd; but this my departed friend wou'd have &s;o decidedly approv'd of, that I take upon me to &s;ay, you differ in your doctrine; and being employ'd in &s;eeking out &s;ome &s;ucce&s;&s;or, who &s;hall, as I before &s;aid, tread as nearly as po&s;|&s;ible in the &s;teps of that excellent and ever-lamented friend, I can only tell you, that I have not yet di&s;cover'd the per&s;on that an&s;wers to my &s;earch."</Q></P>
<P>Here the lady cea&s;ed from &s;peaking. The per&s;ons pre&s;ent were Sir Roger Man&s;tock, I&s;abella, and the gentleman him&s;elf, to whom the words were addre&s;&s;ed; of the&s;e not one &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed at that time to renew the &s;ub|ject; various motives kept them &s;ilent; when

<P>Sir Roger, who was not yet informed of the tran&s;action alluded to by Lady Crowbery, and, to his great &s;urpri&s;e, had heard his application an&s;wered in &s;o different a manner from what he looked for, &s;aw Claypole leave the room without offering a word either in &s;upport of his &s;uit, or which might lead to an explanation of what he did not yet comprehend. I&s;a|bella alone knew the real motives of the ab&s;ent gentleman for the proceeding, which Lady Crowbery re&s;ented in this manner, and at the &s;ame time fore&s;aw the farther di&s;appointment that was in re&s;erve for him, when he &s;hould next have a meeting with his niece. Sir Ro|ger, in the mean time, after &s;ome pau&s;e, re|que&s;ted to be informed by Lady Crowbery, how it was Mr. Claypole had been &s;o unfor|tunate as to loo&s;e her good opinion? This drew from her an account of Henry's generous be|haviour in the matter of Blachford's will, and of the &s;entiments Mr. Claypole had expre&s;&s;ed upon that tran&s;action, when he called upon
<PB N="149" REF="157">
Henry at Crowbery. Every circum&s;tance of this was new to the worthy Baronet, who, without he&s;itation, concurred in pa&s;&s;ing the highe&s;t encomiums on our hero, and con|cluded by &s;aying, that he always &s;u&s;pected his friend Claypole to have a little more attention to the main chance, than was &s;trictly con&s;i&s;tent with his own way of thinking.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Witne&s;s,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"his readine&s;s to give up me and my pari&s;h for an exchange, which, upon cal|culation, cou'd not have benefitted him in more than a hundred a year at mo&s;t, &s;o that, I con|fe&s;s to you, it put me upon computing the price at which he valued the &s;ociety of an old friend, who&s;e hou&s;e and heart were ever open to him. After all, perhaps, it may be too much to require of any man, that he &s;hou'd love me better than his money; and as for his advice to our friend Henry, which appears to you &s;o reprehen&s;ible, recollecting, as I do, how much it was the wi&s;h of his heart to marry him to his niece Fanny, I can account for his regret at &s;eeing &s;uch a fortune as Mr. Blachford's &s;lip out of his fingers."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Heavens!"</Q> exclaimed Lady Crowbery, forgetting her&s;elf in the mo|ment of &s;urpri&s;e, <Q REND="inline">"had he the a&s;&s;urance to &s;uppo&s;e that my Henry wou'd throw him&s;elf

<P>The Baronet, though too much a man of honour to expo&s;e what had been pa&s;&s;ing in his hou&s;e, was yet unwilling to hear his intelli|gence &s;o totally decried, and turning to his daughter, &s;aid, he fancied &s;he could te&s;tify there was &s;ome truth in what he &s;aid: this ap|peal came rather un&s;ea&s;onably upon I&s;abella, who had taken to her&s;elf the application of &s;ome words, which Lady Crowbery had con|cluded with, and &s;he &s;imply replied, that Mi&s;s Claypole, &s;he believed, would not have been adver&s;e to &s;uch a propo&s;al; but &s;he added, in|cautiou&s;ly enough, that &s;he was &s;ure no &s;uch thing could ever take place.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Indeed!"</Q> cried her father, <Q REND="inline">"are you &s;ure of that?

<P>WHEN I&s;abella gave this hone&s;t an&s;wer to her father's que&s;tion, a light &s;truck upon his mind, which &s;ome of our readers may think might have reached him before. Accu&s;tomed ever to behold her open brow without a cloud, and to hear her &s;peak to him without faultering, the embarra&s;&s;ment that now he could not fail to di&s;cover, opened a new train of thoughts, and he in&s;tantly pre&s;&s;ed fre&s;h que&s;tions upon I&s;abella, which &s;he had too much candour to evade. She told him how &s;he had accidentally dropt in at dame May's that very morning, where &s;he found Henry.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"And how came he there?"</Q> Sir Roger demand|ed?&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"He had hurt his arm, and the good woman was dre&s;&s;ing it."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"And did he tell you of Mr. Claypole's propo&s;al for his niece, and of his own rejection of her?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I under|&s;tood,"</Q> replied I&s;abella, <Q REND="inline">"he had an interview with Mi&s;s Claypole, which had been conclu|&s;ive

again&s;t any further corre&s;pondence or con|nection."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"And how was you intere&s;ted,"</Q> demanded he, <Q REND="inline">"to be inform'd of that?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I &s;hou'd hope,"</Q> replied I&s;abella, <Q REND="inline">"that my father does not want to &s;earch into my thoughts, as &s;u&s;pecting they conceal what ought not to be there."</Q>&mdash;This apo&s;trophe, and perhaps the pre&s;ence of Lady Crowbery, checked for a time the curio&s;ity of Sir Roger; Zachary al&s;o helped to turn the &s;ubject, by coming in with a medicine he had been pre|paring for his patient.</P>
<P>The reverend Mr. Claypole, who had left the room upon his rebuff from the lady pa|trone&s;s of Ratcliffe's living, had gone &s;traight to the vicarage in que&s;t of his niece: here he was greeted, not with the &s;ight of Fanny, but of Fanny's letter, put into his hands by the old woman of the hou&s;e, who informed him that the young lady had taken her departure early in the morning. This letter briefly told him, that &s;he had for ever taken leave of a place that was rendered odious to her by the treat|ment &s;he had met in it; that &s;he made no doubt &s;tories would be circulated di&s;reputable to her character, but they could be nothing but the ba&s;e&s;t forgeries, which &s;he conjured him
<PB N="153" REF="161">
to treat with the contempt they merited; that &s;he had di&s;covered the young man, he thought &s;o well of, to be half knave half fool, and, for her part, &s;he had done with him; &s;he added, that he had frightened her into fits by his awkwardne&s;s, in letting a knife, which &s;he had u&s;ed for cutting open the leaves of a book, run into his arm, and wound him. In conclu&s;ion, &s;he apologized for the early hour of her de|parture, which prevented her from taking leave of him; but he &s;hould hear from her when &s;he arrived in London.</P>
<P>Claypole's brea&s;t now boiled with indigna|tion again&s;t Henry; he had di&s;graced his niece, and, which was wor&s;e, di&s;appointed him of a valuable living; for he was too well informed, not to know that Ratcliffe had left it in a &s;tate that would bear a deal of &s;tretching. In this temper of mind he &s;auntered &s;lowly towards Sir Roger's, deeply meditating by the way: the baronet was no le&s;s eager for the meet|ing than he was, and having &s;tept out of the room when Zachary entered in, encountered him in the hall. Claypole was full charged with venom he had brooded upon by the way; <Q REND="inline">"I thank you, dear and worthy Sir,"</Q> &s;aid he, with counterfeited humility, <Q REND="inline">"for your kind though
<PB N="154" REF="162">
ineffectual interce&s;&s;ion in my favour. Hav|ing heard a character of my&s;elf &s;o contrary to what I expected or de&s;erved, I hope you will not think me petulant, if I beg leave to retire to my chamber for this evening, rather than meet the eyes of a lady, which had not us'd to look &s;o unfavourably upon me, and for whom I entertain too high a reverence and e&s;teem, to be indifferent to her contempt of me. Perhaps, Sir, you may have thought, as Lady Crowbery does, that this young man's conduct in Blachford's bu&s;ine&s;s is an act of high honour, and that I was a very &s;habby fellow to advi&s;e him otherwi&s;e."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I don't quite &s;ay that,"</Q> replied Sir Roger gravely; <Q REND="inline">"becau&s;e I believe you thought of him as likely to be a part of the family; but I con|fe&s;s to you, the tran&s;action, as repre&s;ented to me, appears a very honourable one on his part."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"His motives mu&s;t determine that,"</Q> &s;aid Claypole; <Q REND="inline">"it is a cheap way of doing a &s;eemingly di&s;intere&s;ted action, when he gains the favour of Lady Crowbery, and the good opinion of Mi&s;s Man&s;tock."</Q> Sir Roger &s;tarted. <Q REND="inline">"I own,"</Q> continued he, <Q REND="inline">"that I did zealou&s;ly pre&s;s forward a marriage, in which I did not altogether wi&s;h to make &s;o total a

<PB N="156" REF="164">
than the real ones; for, in the fir&s;t place, what cou'd I profit by the exchange, granting that Mr. Ratcliffe's living were &s;omewhat better than my own, a fact which I have not been curious to enquire into: but be the advan|tage what in may, &s;urely it wou'd not balance the difference between living upon my own e&s;tabli&s;hment, and appertaining to your's; but when I fore&s;aw, with grief of heart, that whe|ther this young namele&s;s fellow married, or married not, my Fanny Claypole, my &s;tation in this family had no la&s;ting tenure, con&s;i&s;tently with your repo&s;e or my own, can you won|der that I caught at any hope that offer'd me an opportunity of retreating in good time, without di&s;turbing your peace at my depar|ture, content that you &s;hou'd even condemn me for the mea&s;ure, rather than be driven, as I now am, to open your eyes upon the real motives for it?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mr. Claypole,"</Q> &s;aid Sir Roger, no longer able to refrain him&s;elf, <Q REND="inline">"you do indeed open my eyes, which have been in darkne&s;s; but I mu&s;t de&s;ire you will al&s;o enable them to &s;ee clearly all the danger that is before them, el&s;e, permit me to ob&s;erve, that your friend|&s;hip only goes the length of alarming me, but

&s;tops &s;hort where it &s;hou'd inform me."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Sir Roger Man&s;tock,"</Q> replied Claypole, in a tone of much &s;olemnity, <Q REND="inline">"after the proof I have given how far my attachment has al|ready carried me, I &s;hou'd hope you will not &s;uppo&s;e it likely to &s;top &s;hort, or &s;hrink from any duties friend&s;hip can require of me. If this young adventurer had carried off my niece, I &s;hou'd have held my&s;elf ju&s;tified in &s;erving you &s;o far, and &s;hou'd have &s;eceded from your family in &s;ilence; for where wou'd have been the kindne&s;s or u&s;e in opening your eyes upon dangers, after you had e&s;cap'd them? You would then, perhaps, have &s;et me down in your thoughts for a capricious, fickle minded man; but my con&s;cience would have witne&s;s'd better things. But now that this Mr. Henry Fitzhenry, or whatever name he chu&s;es to be call'd by, has thought fit to reject Mi&s;s Claypole, with fifteen thou&s;and pounds to her fortune, and my hone&s;t attempt is defeated, with the &s;acrifice of my niece's peace and reputation, whil&s;t he is extoll'd to the &s;kies for his rejection both of her gene|rous offer and Blachford's liberal beque&s;t, what am I to think, but that he has friends in tho&s;e who &s;o highly prai&s;e him, who are too

well di&s;po&s;ed to reward him for &s;acrificing my connection, and to ruin me in your e&s;teem, (of which de&s;ign I think you have already had &s;ome proof) for my attempt to take upon my&s;elf your danger, and defeat their wi&s;hes! And now, Sir Roger, let me make one &s;erious condition with you in this place; con&s;ent to drop this matter for the pre&s;ent; Lady Crow|bery is your gue&s;t for this night; &s;eparate not your&s;elf any longer from her, I be&s;eech you; change not, if po&s;&s;ible, your countenance, nor abate of your good humour to either of tho&s;e amiable ladies, who will wonder at your ab|&s;ence, if you do not &s;uffer me to retire im|mediately. If any que&s;tion is a&s;k'd, why I do not attend at &s;upper, be pleas'd to let my apology be a &s;light indi&s;po&s;ition: the plea will not offend again&s;t the truth, for I am far from well."</Q> This &s;aid, he took Sir Roger's hand, tenderly pre&s;&s;ed it in his, and ha&s;tened away.</P>
<P>When he found him&s;elf in his chamber, he again took out his niece's letter, and then for the fir&s;t time di&s;covered that there was a po&s;t|&s;cript over leaf, which he had overlooked in his fir&s;t reading, there being no reference to it. The purport was as follows:&mdash;</P>

<P>This po&s;t&s;cript, &s;o happily coinciding with his own operations already commenced, de|termined Claypole to &s;et out immediately upon di&s;coveries.

Of her he learnt no more, than that Henry had been a pretty con&s;idera|ble time alone with Mi&s;s Fanny, during which &s;he never entered the room; but that ju&s;t as he was going, he rung the bell with great vehemence, and upon her coming to it, told

her, that her young lady was taken &s;uddenly ill, and charged her to be careful of her, and not leave her; that &s;he did not then di&s;cover he was wounded, but was told it by Mi&s;s Fanny, who raved, and rambled, and took on at a piteous rate, being in &s;trong hy&s;terics. <Q REND="inline">"As for what &s;he talk'd about in her fit"</Q>&mdash;&s;aid the old woman. <Q REND="inline">"Tell me what &s;he &s;aid in her fit;"</Q> quoth Claypole; <Q REND="inline">"it is very ma|terial to me to know what &s;he &s;aid, and 'tis your duty not to conceal it from me."</Q> The woman then repeated, as well as &s;he could, &s;uch of her incoherent &s;allies, as &s;he could call to mind: they were made up of various pa&s;&s;ions, breaking out in confu&s;ed exclama|tions; &s;ometimes of violent love, at other times of hatred and contempt as violent; &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions &s;he recollected full of terror for his life, and as if &s;he had accu&s;ed her&s;elf of having murdered him. <Q REND="inline">"At one time,"</Q> added the old woman, <Q REND="inline">"I was &s;orely afraid the poor young lady had been betray'd, and dealt di&s;|hone&s;tly by, for &s;he &s;aid again and again, that he had made a fool of her, and was a ba&s;e deceiver; upon that I &s;traitly a&s;k'd her, if he had taken advantage of her in an unlucky mo|ment, and had his wicked will of her.

<P>A NATURE like Sir Roger Man&s;tock's was not ea&s;ily wrought upon by the poi&s;on of &s;u&s;picion towards a character like I&s;abella's: Confidence, long rooted in &s;trong affection, was not &s;peedily to be &s;haken; yet his happine&s;s was di&s;turbed, and his &s;pirits

depre&s;&s;ed. When Henry was &s;poken of, which he frequently was by Lady Crowbery, he was either &s;ilent on the &s;ubject, or contrived to pa&s;s it off; his looks at the &s;ame time were watchfully directed towards his daughter, and the effect of them was very painfully felt. When Lady Crowbery retired for the night, he attended her him&s;elf to her chamber, and contrived to take I&s;abella away with him. The night pa&s;&s;ed heavily with her, and the next morning afforded no opportunity of being private with her cou&s;in; the &s;ad hour of de|parture drew near, and though there was not more than time for &s;uch friends to take a fare|wel, which was probably to be their la&s;t, no|body dared to &s;peak the word; all parties &s;ate &s;ilent; Zachary Cawdle had the con&s;idera|tion to keep out of the way: at la&s;t, Lady Crowbery &s;poke as follows:&mdash;</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I had re&s;erv'd many things to &s;ay to you, my dear uncle, but I perceive too late the fallacy of po&s;tponing tho&s;e things to a time, when the pain of parting occupies the mind to the exclu&s;ion of all other thoughts.

<P><Q REND="inline">"Heaven forbid!"</Q> cried the venerable Baronet, and tenderly embraced her. I&s;abella, weeping, next pre&s;ented her&s;elf, to take her melancholy adieu; Lady Crowbery whi&s;pered a few words to her as &s;he was in her arms, and then, with a&s;&s;i&s;tance, ro&s;e from her chair, and was &s;upported to the carriage, that waited at the door, where all the dome&s;tics of Man|&s;tock Hou&s;e were a&s;&s;embled, to offer up their good wi&s;hes for her recovery: alas! how fruitle&s;s!</P>
<P>Sir Roger retired to his library, I&s;abella to
<PB N="166" REF="174">
her apartment. Claypole had kept clo&s;e, and did not pre&s;ent him&s;elf at Lady Crowbery's departure. This was not unnoticed by Sir Roger, who did not expect to meet &s;o &s;trong a mark of his re&s;entment: the &s;olemn decla|ration made by that lady, under the impre&s;|&s;ion that they were the la&s;t words &s;he &s;hould addre&s;s to him in per&s;on, &s;unk deep into his mind&mdash;<HI>I cannot revoke my opinion of him.</HI>&mdash;He was not of a nature prone to &s;u&s;picion, nor had he that gift of intuition, which can di&s;cover the real character of a man, by tracing it through the windings and involu|tions of artifice and cunning. Claypole, by &s;u|perior acutene&s;s of intellect, had gained a complete a&s;cendancy over him, and pre&s;erved it long; yet he had not a little &s;urpri&s;ed Sir Roger by his &s;olicitation for Ratcliffe's liv|ing; it &s;truck him in the light of a dereliction of his friend&s;hip, upon motives merely mer|cenary; but the artful interpretation afterwards given to tho&s;e motives had put a very fa|vourable glo&s;s upon it as to Claypole's con|duct; but it fatally in&s;tilled into his mind a doubt, as to the deare&s;t object of his affec|tions, and for the fir&s;t time &s;hook his confi|dence in his beloved I&s;abella. This was now
<PB N="167" REF="175">
the painful &s;ubject of his meditations; and after oppo&s;ing thought to thought, and weighing them calmly and impartially to the be&s;t of his judgment and under&s;tanding, he began to &s;um up the re&s;ult of his reflections in the fol|lowing manner:&mdash;</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lady Crowbery &s;ays, &s;he cannot revoke her opinion of Mr. Claypole; neither can I, without better proof than I am yet provided with.&mdash;If a &s;mall augmentation of his income cou'd have tempted him to turn his back upon me, I &s;hou'd have doubted the &s;incerity of his friend&s;hip; for he does not want money.&mdash;But this exchange was not the way to gain it; therefore I am the more di&s;pos'd to believe the rea&s;ons he a&s;&s;igns for &s;eeking it.&mdash;He &s;ays, he wou'd have given his niece to Henry for my &s;ake, for my repo&s;e,&mdash;and what can that imply, but that he apprehends me to be in danger; and how in danger! but that he &s;u&s;|pects my I&s;abella to be attach'd to the young man, whom he wou'd have married to Mi&s;s Claypole.&mdash;This is indeed alarming; &s;u&s;picion is always &s;o; but I mu&s;t not give way to &s;u&s;|picion without proofs; hitherto he has given me none. I&s;abella confe&s;&s;es that &s;he met him accidentally at the cottage; what then?
<PB N="168" REF="176">
her very confe&s;&s;ion of it &s;hou'd di&s;arm &s;u&s;|picion; and my child has ever been ingenu|ous and &s;incere. Claypole wou'd have me think he took a dangerous connection on him|&s;elf for my &s;ake; if &s;o, he has had an e&s;cape; why then this re&s;entment again&s;t Henry for refu&s;ing to endanger him? But he was eager enough for the connection when I fir&s;t con|vers'd with him about it: he &s;ought the young man, unknown to me, confer'd with him at Crowbery, and &s;trove to per&s;uade him to avail him&s;elf of Blachford's legacy; that cou'd not be for my &s;ake; there is &s;omething here that does not &s;eem to accord: I am puzzled how to judge."</Q></P>
<P>At this moment Claypole announced him|&s;elf with a gentle tap at the library dour, and was de&s;ired to enter. Sir Roger had well nigh entangled him&s;elf in his medications, and pro|bably was not &s;orry thus to cut the knot, which he could not untie. <Q REND="inline">"Well, my good friend,"</Q> &s;aid he, with a &s;igh, <Q REND="inline">"my niece is gone, perhaps for ever: I think you was not pre&s;ent to take leave of her."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"My pre&s;ence, I am afraid,"</Q> replied Claypole, <Q REND="inline">"cou'd not have been agreeable to her, nor my re&s;pects acceptable."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"To me at lea&s;t they wou'd, if

I am free to &s;ay, notwith&s;tanding Lady Crowbery's deci&s;ion again&s;t me for my opinion in that ca&s;e, I did not approve of his romantic heroi&s;m in beggaring him&s;elf for Su&s;an May's ba&s;tard: he held a very haughty language to me upon that occa&s;ion, and I do not think it became him either to talk or to act as he did in that affair."</Q>&mdash;To this Sir Roger replied, <Q REND="inline">"A haughty language did not become him, and

<P><PB N="176" REF="184">In return for this candid tender Sir Roger ob&s;erved, that it was not merely the circum|&s;tance of her meeting Henry, and conver&s;ing with him without a third per&s;on pre&s;ent that gave him alarm; that mu&s;t have often hap|pened whil&s;t he was a vi&s;itor in his hou&s;e; but in this bu&s;ine&s;s there was a &s;eeming &s;ecrecy and my&s;teriou&s;ne&s;s in their meeting that gave it the air of a concerted a&s;&s;ignation; that his &s;udden departure without a word &s;aid or writ|ten to him by way of farewell favoured that appearance; and he added, that he could not well account for his declining a connection every way &s;o flattering and &s;o advantageous to a per&s;on in his circum&s;tance as that with Mi&s;s Claypole, any otherwi&s;e than as having an at|tachment el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to this I&s;abella a&s;&s;ured him, that her meeting with Henry at the cottage was purely accidental: he had a wound which broke out afre&s;h whil&s;t &s;he was there and bled profu&s;ely; &s;he &s;taid with him whil&s;t it was dre&s;t; it was a deep &s;tab in the arm: &s;he re|mained &s;ome time after it was &s;tanched, and they were left to them&s;elves; he then told her that his treaty with Mi&s;s Claypole was broken off; the rea&s;ons for it he did not tell, but he
<PB N="177" REF="185">
certainly did not &s;peak of it with any regret, nor did &s;he believe he had ever con&s;idered it either as an advantageous or agreeable connec|tion. As to her father's ob&s;ervation, that he had not communicated with him in any man|ner, &s;he &s;aid &s;he could only a&s;cribe that to his fear of being que&s;tioned about his wound, of which &s;he found him very unwilling to give any other account than in general terms as an accident, and even this &s;he ob&s;erved was un|plea&s;ant to him to &s;peak of. <Q REND="inline">"Did he come wounded from his interview with Fanny Clay|pole?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"She believed he did."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Then he got it there."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"She under&s;tood &s;o."</Q></P>
<P>Sir Roger pondered upon this for &s;ome time in &s;ilence; he then renewed the conver&s;ation in the following manner: <Q REND="inline">"This is a dark bu|&s;ine&s;s, I&s;abella: Fanny Claypole is a girl of a violent temper; as for Henry, I &s;hou'd be unju&s;t if I did not bear te&s;timony to his good principles as far as I have had experience of them: his per&s;on, manners and behaviour are highly impre&s;&s;ive; the &s;ituation in which I &s;ound him, the unju&s;t treatment he had &s;uf|fer'd, and his deportment under it, prejudic'd me &s;trongly in his favour; my niece Crow|bery's protection in the fir&s;t instance was na|tural,

When I invited him into my hou&s;e, I did not forget that I po&s;&s;e&s;s'd a beautiful daughter, the heir|e&s;s of my fortune and the darling of my &s;oul; but &s;uch was the di&s;tance of your conditions from each other, &s;uch my confidence in your di&s;cretion, and my opinion of his proper un|der&s;tanding of him&s;elf, that I own to you I fore&s;aw no danger, and let me hope I have in|curr'd none. But if my confidence has led me into error, or he, mi&s;taking your pity for encouragement, has been ra&s;h enough to at|tempt your affections, it is now high time that I endeavour to repair that error by calling you to a recollection of your&s;elf and me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And what,"</Q> &s;he demanded, <Q REND="inline">"wou'd my father pre&s;cribe to me for his future a&s;&s;urance and content?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I wou'd have you keep in mind,"</Q> he re|plied, <Q REND="inline">"that I exact no other rights than nature has endow'd me with, when I require you, if ever you entertain'd a thought of this young man, to call to mind now in good time my &s;o|lemn

<P><Q REND="inline">"But he has enemies,"</Q> &s;he rejoined; <Q REND="inline">"at lea&s;t there are &s;ome minds &s;o ho&s;tile to merit, or &s;o perverted by malice, as to allow him no applau&s;e,"</Q></P>

<P>ISABELLA found the angui&s;h of her mind allayed by the preceding conver&s;a|tion with her father; it had not totally extin|gui&s;hed it. There were &s;till &s;ome tender in|cidents belonging to her interview with Henry, which remained untold; yet upon reflection &s;he could hardly be per&s;uaded, to attach any degree of &s;elf reproach to the omi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch incidents in her narrative, as it was next to
<PB N="182" REF="190">
impo&s;&s;ible to convey by any form of words the delicacy of tho&s;e circum&s;tances which in|troduced, and the purity of tho&s;e &s;en&s;ations which admitted the&s;e cha&s;te and innocent en|dearments. How could &s;he find expre&s;&s;ions that would de&s;cribe what was pa&s;&s;ing in the mind of Henry, when &s;tarting from his re|verie on her &s;udden appearance in his room, he wildly ran and caught her in his arms, unmindful of his wound that bur&s;t in&s;tantly open? In the like degree language would have failed her to impre&s;s him with a ju&s;t conception of tho&s;e &s;oft but guiltle&s;s emotions, occa&s;ioned by the &s;ight of the blood flowing from his wound, by the tenderne&s;s of his looks, his language, and the mixt a&s;&s;emblage of enervating ideas at the touching cri&s;is of departure, which had cau&s;ed her to &s;ink un|der a momentary oppre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits, whil&s;t he &s;upported her in his arms. This &s;he de&s;paired to paint in terms that could ex|emplify a &s;cene, which nothing but the man|ner of it could &s;trictly ju&s;tify, and none but a &s;pectator could completely under&s;tand.</P>
<P>Therefore it was that her ingenuous nature found a plea in its own want of powers for letting the&s;e &s;mall incidents remain untold,
<PB N="183" REF="191">
and who that has a heart, which love or pity ever touched, but will &s;ub&s;cribe a wi&s;h that they had been un&s;een?</P>
<P>In the next conver&s;ation that took place between Claypole and Sir Roger, the latter repeated the &s;ub&s;tance of what had pa&s;&s;ed be|tween him&s;elf and his daughter; expre&s;&s;ing his entire &s;atisfaction in the re&s;ult of it, and declaring in the joy of his heart, that he was now perfectly at ea&s;e with re&s;pect to his late alarm, about the inteveiw at the cottage. Claypole affected to receive this account with plea&s;ure, &s;aying he was very glad he had taken that method of inve&s;tigation, which made the quicke&s;t di&s;patch in di&s;mi&s;&s;ing his unea&s;ine&s;s; happine&s;s, he ob&s;erved, was worth obtaining even by delu&s;ion, and for that rea&s;on he would recommend to him to &s;it down contented with the account he had received, though it was from the party concerned, and not expo&s;e him&s;elf to the ri&s;que of future inquietude by inve&s;tigating the affair any further, or &s;eeking after witne&s;&s;es who&s;e accounts might perhaps perplex him, by differing in &s;ome particulars from that which had been &s;o &s;atisfactory. He then with an air of indifference turned the di&s;|cour&s;e to &s;ome other &s;ubject, and left his ob|&s;ervation
<PB N="184" REF="192">
to work as it might, or might not, within the mind of his friend to whom he ad|dre&s;&s;ed it.</P>
<P>The next day Ezekiel Daw walked over from Crowbery, upon a vi&s;it to his friend Dame May at the cottage, bearing a kind me&s;&s;age from her daughter, and inviting her to take up her abode with her at the decea&s;ed Mr. Blachford's hou&s;e, where, by advice of her friends, &s;he purpo&s;ed to e&s;tabli&s;h her|&s;elf and the infant heir. He was al&s;o encharged by Su&s;an to apologize on her behalf, in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful terms, to Mi&s;s Man&s;tock, for her not paying her duty in per&s;on, and with other &s;mall commi&s;&s;ions to be &s;ettled with the &s;ervants. This brought him to the great hou&s;e, after halting on his way at the widow's, and his arrival was announced to I&s;abella, as &s;he was in company with her father and Mr. Claypole. She would fain have left the room to attend upon him, but the thought &s;truck Sir Roger to have him introduced to the par|lour, declaring that he was not only greatly taken with the oddity of his character, but that he e&s;teemed him as a very upright hone&s;t creature.</P>
<P>Ezekiel made his advances in a re&s;pectful
<PB N="185" REF="193">
manner to the worthy Baronet, and was by him very kindly welcomed to Man&s;tock Hou&s;e. He acquitted him&s;elf of his commi&s;|&s;ion to the young Lady after his manner pro|perly enough, and then made an effort to take leave, but was &s;tayed by a que&s;tion from Sir Roger, relative to the amount of what Mr. Blachford had bequeathed to his heir: Ezekiel &s;aid that it con&s;i&s;ted of property in Jamaica, which returned about two thou&s;and pounds one year with another, as far as he could un|der&s;tand, with about ten thou&s;and pounds in money, and the &s;mall e&s;tate at Crowbery; but he de&s;ired not to be under&s;tood as &s;peak|ing correctly. Sir Roger &s;aid in an under-voice to Claypole,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"It is not &s;o much as I gue&s;&s;ed he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, but it is a great deal for a poor man to give up upon princi|ple."</Q> He then enquired if there were any legacies: Ezekiel informed him there were a few; upon which Claypole &s;aid,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I &s;up|po&s;e you have got a legacy, &s;ir;"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"No, reverend &s;ir,"</Q> replied the good man, <Q REND="inline">"I have no legacy, nor did I covet one; it fits not the &s;ervant of Chri&s;t to be greedy after gain."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Then I &s;uppo&s;e,"</Q> re&s;umed he, <Q REND="inline">"that it was by your advice Mr. Fitzhenry declined

I confe&s;s to you I &s;uppre&s;t this circum&s;tance in my di&s;cour&s;e with you, but I had motives for &s;o doing which did not &s;pring from any con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt or dread of explanation on my own part: my &s;ilence had re&s;pect to others, not to my&s;elf; and the &s;ame motives that led me to &s;top Ezekiel Daw ju&s;t now from &s;peaking on this &s;ubject, operated with me, and will operate, for avoiding as far as it is in my power any mention of that affair."</Q> She then turned

<HEAD>CHAPTER IX. A tempting Offer honourably with&s;tood.</HEAD>
<P>TO this defence Claypole made no reply, neither did Sir Roger &s;eem in ha&s;te to &s;peak; for the gu&s;t of anger, which artifice had rai&s;ed, innocence and truth had now di&s;pelled. He turned his eyes upon the accu&s;er fir&s;t, and then upon his daughter; each look was deci|&s;ive to the party it was addre&s;&s;ed to; neither of them &s;tood in need of any further explana|tion of the opinion he entertained; at la&s;t, turning to Claypole, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I think, Sir, it had been better for us both if you had not li&s;ten'd to this eaves-dropper; for it appears to me, that you have gather'd nothing from her information, but what my I&s;abella has very naturally accounted for.</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"It is very well,"</Q> replied Claypole; <Q REND="inline">"I know the con&s;equences of over-zealous friend&s;hip, and none can ac|crue to me, which I am not prepar'd for."</Q> With the&s;e words he left the room.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"Hold there,"</Q> replied the father; <Q REND="inline">"I am

<P><Q REND="inline">"No matter,"</Q> rejoined he; <Q REND="inline">"it is of him, it relates to him, and that's rea&s;on enough why I &s;hou'd know it. In one word, I&s;abella, give me up the matter of your information with|out the author of it, and if it appears, to my &s;atisfaction, that this young man is by birth a gentleman, and &s;uch as I can with propriety adopt into my family, I pa&s;s my word to you, that I will no longer oppo&s;e my&s;elf to your in|clinations, for his character and manners plea&s;e me, and I can well believe his per&s;on not le&s;s engaging; but if you will not confide to me what you know of this young man, I &s;hall take for granted it is not fit to be known, and, in that per&s;ua&s;ion, exert the authority of a fa|ther for laying my injunctions upon you, never to let me &s;ee his face, or hear his name again; neither &s;hall I forgive you, if I di&s;cover that you carry on any corre&s;pondence with him, or about him.

<P><PB N="198" REF="206">A &s;tronger temptation than was now offered to I&s;abella could hardly pre&s;ent it&s;elf; but her &s;teady nature rejected it without &s;cruple, and, by per&s;i&s;ting in her good faith to Lady Crow|bery, &s;he incurred, to her infinite regret, the di&s;plea&s;ure of her father, mo&s;t tenderly be|lov'd: the conference, therefore, concluded in anger on his part, and in a &s;olemn promi&s;e on her's, to hold no corre&s;pondence with Henry, nor, even through her cou&s;in Lady Crowbery, about him in future. Time, it is true, might probably develope the my&s;tery which her ho|nour would not &s;uffer her to do, and to that alone &s;he tru&s;ted for a ju&s;tification of her &s;i|lence, both towards her father and her lover.</P>
<P>The Rev. Mr. Claypole, meanwhile, betook him&s;elf in &s;ullen di&s;content to his chamber, there to meditate upon future mea&s;ures: in the interim, a letter was delivered to him, which had come by &s;pecial me&s;&s;enger from Crowbery Ca&s;|tle, the contents of which were as follow:&mdash;</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Uncle,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>In con&s;equence of a mo&s;t polite invitation from the worthy Lord of this ca&s;tle, I have been prevail'd upon to take up my abode here for a few days. The chief inducement with me for accepting this &s;olicitation was,
<PB N="199" REF="207">
the opportunity it affords me of being within reach of my dear uncle, without the pain of taking up my re&s;idence in the &s;ame place with a family from whom I have received the mo&s;t unhand&s;ome treatment. Nothing can exceed the kindne&s;s and attention of Lord Crowbery, and I am charged by him, in the mo&s;t earne&s;t manner, to reque&s;t the fa|vour of your company at the ca&s;tle: I am &s;ure you will not regret the change from Man&s;tock Hou&s;e; and, if I have any intere&s;t with you, his reque&s;t will be complied with the rather as I find my&s;elf, in Lady Crow|bery's ab&s;ence, in a &s;ituation to &s;tand in need of your cover and protection, being at pre&s;ent the only female vi&s;itor in the hou&s;e.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Nothing could be more acceptable to Mr. Claypole, in his pre&s;ent &s;tate of mind, than the invitation which this letter conveyed; it re|lieved him from a &s;ituation, of which he was heartily &s;ick, and offered him the gratification of putting a &s;light upon Lady Crowbery, of the mo&s;t pointed &s;ort: he well knew how it would be felt by Sir Roger Man&s;tock, and on
<PB N="200" REF="208">
that very account he embraced it the more readily; for there was no longer any trace of pa&s;t favours in his memory, and of favours to come all expectation was at an end. He had, however, views upon futurity in Lord Crow|bery's particular; for he had &s;een enough of Lady Crowbery, to &s;et her down, in his account, as a dead woman, and his niece Fanny was a very lively one. He had more than once taken her with him to the ca&s;tle, in times when better harmony &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the families, and on tho&s;e vi&s;its Fanny had made her way much better with the lord than with the lady of the hou&s;e, with the latter of whom, to &s;ay the truth, &s;he was in no great favour. The fact was, that Lady Crowbery regarded her charac|ter with contempt, and Fanny imputed it to jealou&s;y; to rou&s;e this pa&s;&s;ion was a grati|fication too agreeable to be re&s;i&s;ted, and therefore, though his Lord&s;hip was nothing le&s;s than an Adonis, there was amu&s;ement at lea&s;t in the experiment, and &s;he con&s;idered it as no &s;mall triumph to engage the attention of a man, who was capable of neglecting a mo&s;t lovely woman, and devoting him&s;elf to her. Her purpo&s;e in ha&s;tening from the vicarage, in the manner we have related, was with the
<PB N="201" REF="209">
view of obtaining one more interview with Henry, or, at lea&s;t, of gaining &s;uch intelligence as might &s;atisfy her as to the con&s;equences of his wound; &s;he therefore boldly &s;haped her cour&s;e towards the port he was to embark at, but in pa&s;&s;ing through the village of Crow|bery, luckily fell in with the noble proprietor, who was cheering his &s;pirits with a morning ride, in his lady's ab&s;ence, and, after &s;ome im|portunity, prevailed upon her to &s;top &s;hort in her progre&s;s, and repo&s;e her&s;elf in the ca&s;tle. Here &s;he remained &s;ome time, till propriety, or &s;omething el&s;e, dictated to her the expedient of writing to her uncle in manner above re|lated, to which his Lord&s;hip, with equal pro|priety, very courteou&s;ly acceded.</P>
<P>Sir Roger Man&s;tock, who perceived that his daughter was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;ecret that he could not extort from her, concluded, very naturally, that it came from Lady Crowbery; and this brought to his recollection, what &s;he had &s;aid to him upon their parting, relative to the paper &s;he had inclo&s;ed under the &s;ame cover with her will, to be opened after her death. This packet he had depo&s;ited in his &s;trong box; it was under four &s;eals, and evi|dently enveloped more papers than one: he
<PB N="202" REF="210">
had no doubt, from I&s;abella's an&s;wers, that the &s;ecret &s;he had in charge from Lady Crowbery related to Henry's birth, and that it would be di&s;covered upon the opening of this packet. He could not reconcile to him&s;elf the being excluded from a confidence which had been repo&s;ed in his daughter, and was not a little di&s;contented to find, that his niece had referred him to her death for a di&s;covery that &s;he had already made to I&s;abella.</P>
<P>He now &s;ummoned I&s;abella to him, and holding Lady Crowbery's packet in his hand, addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to her as follows:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I am here encharged with a paper, &s;eal'd as you &s;ee, containing your cou&s;in's will, and other private matters, which are only to be open'd by me upon the event of her death: I have no doubt but it inclo&s;es a di&s;covery of that very &s;ecret, which &s;he has already imparted to you, and that it refers to the my&s;tery of this young man's birth, who has caus'd &s;o much unhappine&s;s to me and my family. I under|&s;tand withal, that I am to be the executor of this will, and, mo&s;t probably, of certain in&s;truc|tions and tru&s;ts relative to the gentleman, who is then, for the fir&s;t time, to be made known to me. Now the&s;e are terms that I will not
<PB N="203" REF="211">
agree to; I am no dealer in ob&s;cure matters, and it is therefore become my fixt re&s;olution peremptorily to decline the commi&s;&s;ion, and &s;o to inform Lady Crowbery, by &s;pecial expre&s;s, unle&s;s you are prepar'd to tell me what it is you know of the&s;e &s;ecret contents, &s;o far as they relate to the per&s;on called Henry Fitz-Henry; for I do not hold it becoming me, in any re&s;pect, to be &s;urpris'd into a tru&s;t that may involve me with a per&s;on whom at pre|&s;ent I have every rea&s;on to hold at di&s;tance, and for whom, perhaps, I may never choo&s;e to be concern'd, even in the mo&s;t trifling degree. Now then, I&s;abella, let me a&s;k you, if what I have been &s;aying &s;eems rea&s;onable, and whether you rightly comprehend it?"</Q> To this &s;he re|plied in the affirmative; upon which he thus proceeded:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"If it is rea&s;onable then that I &s;hou'd not be blindly committed in a bu&s;ine&s;s I am ignorant of, and if you are intere&s;ted to retain the&s;e papers in my hands, rather than to have them &s;ent back to her from whom they came, you have the alternative at your choice; tell me what you know of them, or take the con&s;equences, and abide by the promi&s;e you have made me: never let me hear the name of Henry Fitz-Henry from your lips any more."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="212"><Q REND="inline">"If that be the alternative,"</Q> replied the lovely I&s;abella, whil&s;t the tears &s;tarted in her eyes, <Q REND="inline">"nece&s;&s;ity impo&s;es the hard ta&s;k upon me of abiding by the painful con&s;equences you have &s;tated. Can I violate my promi&s;e? Ought not every tru&s;t to be held &s;acred? This is of all mo&s;t &s;acred, and I dare not be|tray it. Let me then, for the la&s;t time in your hearing, declare, that wherever this di&s;carded per&s;on, who&s;e name I will not utter in your ears, &s;hall betake him&s;elf, he carries with him, to the end of life, my prayers, my ble&s;&s;ings, my unalienable affections, and my heart for ever; but let not this ingenuous confe&s;&s;ion of my love &s;hake your confidence in my honour, for upon my knees I take to witne&s;s truth, and Heaven it&s;elf, that I will faithfully perform the promi&s;e I have made you, and, renouncing him, devote my&s;elf to your commands and to my duty."</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER X. Where is the Daughter, that may not take a Le&s;&s;on from our Heroine?</HEAD>
<P>THE definitive an&s;wer, which our la&s;t chapter concludes with, put a period to any further conference between the re&s;pective parties, and determined Sir Roger Man&s;tock to take the very mea&s;ure he had threatened to pur&s;ue. He immediately wrote a letter to his niece, explanatory of his &s;en&s;ations with re|&s;pect to Henry, and be&s;eeching her to excu&s;e him from any tru&s;t that had relation to a per&s;on, who had cau&s;ed him &s;uch unea&s;ine&s;s, and whom he was determined never to be connected with: he al&s;o informed her of the promi&s;e made to him by his daughter, and prayed her to &s;end down a tru&s;ty per&s;on, properly authorized, into who&s;e hands he might &s;afely render back the packet &s;he had entru&s;ted to him: he then concluded, in the mo&s;t conciliating terms that his tenderne&s;s could &s;ugge&s;t, wi&s;hing her a re|turn of health, and a&s;&s;uring her of his unal|terable affection.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="214">A &s;ervant was ordered to &s;et off expre&s;s with this letter, who had directions where to find the lady in town, if he did not overtake her on the road, of which, however, there was the greate&s;t probability, as her daily &s;tages were very &s;hort.</P>
<P>In the mean time our amiable heroine did not, like &s;ome others, dedicate every hour to &s;ullen &s;ilence and continual melancholy; for though her private moments were &s;ad enough, &s;he had yet a &s;mile for her father when they met, and the &s;ame eyes that &s;howered tears in &s;ecret, rea&s;&s;umed their native cheerful lu&s;tre when her parent was in &s;ight.</P>
<P>Not &s;o the Reverend Mr. Claypole; there was &s;omething in his brea&s;t re&s;embling tho&s;e goads and &s;tings which di&s;appointed malice or ambition &s;ometimes entertain them&s;elves with in &s;ecret, in the way of penance for attempts which con&s;cience does not quite approve of. He was indeed &s;uperior to that tergiver&s;ation and incertitude of purpo&s;e, which con&s;ciences over nice &s;ometimes impo&s;e upon re&s;olutions not over &s;trong; for he was firmly re&s;olved to turn his back upon his old friend, and his face towards his new one; but he could not quite per&s;uade him&s;elf that &s;uch a re&s;olve had all the
<PB N="207" REF="215">
qualities of a virtuous purpo&s;e; for he could not but feel that he ought to be grateful to the one, and &s;u&s;picious of the other. He had mo|tives, however, and principles of action in his mind, which &s;ome &s;oft &s;ouls in the world &s;eem to know nothing of; among&s;t the&s;e, the grati|fication that his vi&s;it to Lord Crowbery would admini&s;ter to his mind, as an in&s;ult to the pa|trone&s;s of Ratcliffe's living, was to him very plea&s;ing on reflection. That his vi&s;it would be highly offen&s;ive to Sir Roger, and cut off his return for ever after to the hou&s;e of Man|&s;tock, he clearly &s;aw; but there was no lo&s;s could accrue from an exclu&s;ion, where he ne|ver wi&s;hed more to be admitted. In fact, he &s;aw how totally he was ruined in this family; and having no doubt that his niece had dealt the &s;tab to Henry, he was not &s;orry to avail him&s;elf of the protection of Lord Crowbery, and the countenance, which his reception of her would give to her &s;tory, in oppo&s;ition to all others; but what above all weighed with him for accepting the invitation was, the hope it held out to his ambition, upon the event of Lady Crowbery's death, if his niece would con&s;ent to govern her&s;elf by his advice.</P>
<P>Rea&s;oning in this manner, he prepared for
<PB N="208" REF="216">
his departure from the hou&s;e of his friend; and this he did &s;o &s;ecretly and expeditiou&s;ly, that he &s;tole his march, unknown to Sir Roger, leaving only the few following lines as his apo|logy and adieu:&mdash;</P>
<Q>Mr. Claypole leaves his re&s;pectful com|pliments to Sir Roger Man&s;tock, with thanks for all favours: the duty which he owes to a much-injur'd orphan niece compels him to &s;o ha&s;ty a departure, that time, con&s;piring with his own feelings, prevents him from taking leave in per&s;on of a friend, whom he has &s;o long and ju&s;tly held in honour.</Q>
<P>An order was now di&s;patched from Sir Ro|ger, directing Dame May to come to him at the Great Hou&s;e. This was in&s;tantly obeyed by the good woman, who was given to under|&s;tand, in a few words, that her longer re&s;idence in the hou&s;e, which I&s;abella had provided for her, would be very readily di&s;pen&s;ed with. To this &s;he immediately an&s;wered, that &s;he would without delay prepare for her removal, having received an invitation from her daughter, who, by the ble&s;&s;ing of Providence, was now in a condition to &s;upport her; &s;he therefore begged
<PB N="209" REF="217">
leave to return her humble thanks for the favours &s;he had received, and would no longer be a burthen to his charity; &s;he would be gone that very night, if Sir Roger wi&s;hed it, and leave the few things &s;he had in the hou&s;e to follow her the next day. To this the Baronet &s;hortly an&s;wered, that it was very well, and there the bu&s;ine&s;s would have clo&s;ed, but that it occurred to him, as &s;he was leaving the room, to put a que&s;tion to her for curio&s;ity's &s;ake, re&s;pecting Fanny Claypole, which was &s;imply this,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"If &s;he under&s;tood or believed, that the &s;tab in Henry's arm was given by her hand purpo&s;ely and revengefully?"</Q> The poor woman was &s;taggered with the abrupt|ne&s;s of the que&s;tion, and the &s;tern manner in which it was put. She he&s;itated through fear and confu&s;ion; upon which, in an angry tone, Sir Roger told her, he had no wi&s;h to hear her an&s;wer, for he &s;hould put little faith in what anybody &s;aid, who was not always ready with a plain reply to a plain que&s;tion, and with this rebuke waved his hand and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her.</P>
<P>In relating this &s;hort &s;cene as it pa&s;&s;ed, we are &s;en&s;ible that we mu&s;t repre&s;ent the cha|racter of the worthy Baronet in a har&s;her light than it has hitherto been &s;een; but in
<PB N="210" REF="218">
extenuation we have to &s;ay, that he had im|pre&s;&s;ions on his mind not favourable to this poor woman, and was al&s;o di&s;turbed in tem|per at the pre&s;ent moment, by the valedictory note of his &s;eceding friend Mr. Claypole, ju&s;t before delivered into his hands. Under the &s;ame impre&s;&s;ion, he was meditating to give orders for di&s;mantling the cottage of its fur|niture, when I&s;abella entered the room, upon which he thought proper to apprize her of his de&s;ign, qualifying it with &s;ome introduc|tory ob&s;ervations upon the jealou&s;y, which &s;uch favours created in the pari&s;h, and the un&s;uitable elegance with which &s;he had fitted the apartment: <Q REND="inline">"With your leave, therefore,"</Q> added he, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall give orders to have the furniture remov'd, and the cottage reduc'd to a condition better fitted to the poverty of the next inhabitants, whom charity may recom|mend to it."</Q> I&s;abella bowed her head in token of obedience, but felt the unkindne&s;s of this order in the mo&s;t poignant manner; &s;he re|collected that &s;he had been allowed to con|&s;ider this little tenement as her own, and to carry on her works, both within doors and without, after her own &s;imple but elegant fancy: the re&s;umption of a fond gift, and the

rever&s;al of all her little amu&s;ing operations, by a decree &s;o peremptory and unexpected, &s;truck deep into her heart, yet &s;he com|manded her&s;elf &s;o far, when a&s;ked if &s;he had any further u&s;e for the furniture, as to make an&s;wer with great mildne&s;s and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, that there was nothing there &s;he particularly wi&s;hed to pre&s;erve, but a certain print, which &s;he had hung up in the parlour, as a memo|rial of the donor, and the &s;imilitude of a face, which had ever been accu&s;tom'd to look upon her with the tendere&s;t affection. <Q REND="inline">"Pooh! pooh!"</Q> replied Sir Roger, <Q REND="inline">"you have copies enough of that unhappy countenance, and I wou'd advi&s;e you to put this out of the way as &s;peedily as you can, le&s;t it &s;hou'd &s;ometime or other tell tales of what it has been a &s;pec|tator of."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I am an&s;wer'd, Sir,"</Q> replied I&s;a|bella, <Q REND="inline">"and with a reproach, which, if I am capable of de&s;erving from you, I mu&s;t be un|fit any longer to remain in your pre&s;ence."</Q></P>
<P>So &s;aying, &s;he hid her face in her handker|chief, and ha&s;tened out of the room to give vent to her agony.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XI. A pious Mind re&s;orts to Providence for its Support.</HEAD>
<P>FEW moments had pa&s;&s;ed after I&s;abella left her father, before he felt as much pain from the a&s;perity of the retort he had given, as &s;he had experienced in receiving it. Nature could not be long expelled from his heart, nor could ill humour take any la&s;ting po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. He wi&s;hed he had not &s;aid it; he felt the cruelty, the inju&s;tice of wreak|ing vengeance on the harmle&s;s works of her fancy, and, perhaps, he would at this moment have not been &s;orry, could he have recalled the me&s;&s;enger he had di&s;patched to Lady Crowbery. Tho&s;e &s;en&s;ations of regret, which a good mind is capable of, Sir Roger felt; but to confe&s;s and atone is the effort of a great mind as well as good, and that was not be&s;towed by nature upon him. Men, who affect the reputation of a decided character, are too apt to mi&s;take ob&s;tinacy in error for con&s;i&s;tency of opinion; and this was Sir
<PB N="213" REF="221">
Roger's misfortune. Few things could have galled him more than Claypole's conduct, yet his whole life did not furni&s;h &s;o great an in|&s;tance of weakne&s;s, as his pertinacious attach|ment to that unworthy friend. No hypocri&s;y is &s;ooner di&s;covered than the pretended ge|nero&s;ity of a &s;elf-intere&s;ted man, and oppor|tunities enough had offered them&s;elves to Sir Roger Man&s;tock for developing the real cha|racter of Claypole; but the &s;tronger the light was that &s;truck upon him, &s;o much the clo&s;er he &s;hut his eyes again&s;t it. The veil was now drawn off at once, and prejudice could no longer &s;ave him from the conviction of his own mi&s;take. This vexatious di&s;covery was ju&s;t rankling in his mind, when innocence, unfortunately falling in his way, was made to &s;uffer (as too often happens) for the guilty, who had e&s;caped his re&s;entment.</P>
<P>The next morning brought over Su&s;an May to Man&s;tock Hou&s;e, who was admitted to her lovely mi&s;tre&s;s to pay her la&s;t duty, and take leave. On this occa&s;ion, &s;he was led into a diffu&s;ive recital of all particulars re&s;pecting Henry's late generous proceeding, to which I&s;abella lent a willing ear. As the one re|counted the noble acts of her benefactor, the
<PB N="214" REF="222">
heart of the other glowed with delight; his virtues, his &s;ufferings, his magnanimity, his &s;elf-denials were enumerated and acknow|ledged; when the &s;ubject of his mental per|fections was exhau&s;ted, his per&s;on, his grace|ful form, the beauty of his countenance, be|came the topic of their prai&s;e, and on this &s;ubject Su&s;an's eloquence &s;eemed animated into warmer phra&s;e and diction than on the former. Whil&s;t this was going on, I&s;a|bella's blu&s;hes witne&s;&s;ed to the &s;en&s;ibility of &s;oul, which this recital in&s;pired; at la&s;t, no longer able to refrain from joining in the prai&s;e of one &s;o dear to her, &s;he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I per|fectly agree with you in every thing you have &s;aid, or can &s;ay, in commendation of your amiable benefactor. I do not think it is in nature for any human being to be more noble in mind, more charming in per&s;on; and I feel no &s;hame in confe&s;&s;ing to you, what I have avow'd to my father, that in purity of &s;oul I love him. But alas! alas! I have difficulties to encounter, objections to overcome, and &s;orrows to endure, that will probably make that a condition of nece&s;&s;ity, which you may remember was once my choice, and devote me to a &s;ingle life."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Heaven in its mercy

I under&s;tood he had left us, but I did not gue&s;s he was gone thither of all places; I am &s;ure my father mu&s;t have felt that affront very &s;everely."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I hope it will open his eyes,"</Q> replied Su&s;an, <Q REND="inline">"for all the neighbours cry out upon Mr. Claypole al|ready."</Q> I&s;abella made &s;ome &s;light ob&s;er|vation

upon this, and here the conference ended.</P>
<P>I&s;abella, now alone, re&s;igned her&s;elf to me|ditation, and after a few minutes &s;o employed, broke out into the following &s;oliloquy:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Oh Henry! my&s;terious &s;on of an unhappy mo|ther, little does my father think how nearly thou art allied to him; and though I am now interdicted from all communication with thee, I will &s;till nouri&s;h one &s;park of hope, that thy affection may prevail again&s;t appearances, and thou per&s;i&s;t to love me, till time &s;hall develope the &s;ecret which honour now for|bids me to divulge, in &s;pite of all tempta|tions.

<P>WHILST the dramatic author cheers his audience with a tune between the acts, I am forced to fill up my intervals with a treati&s;e, and (what is &s;till wor&s;e) with a trea|ti&s;e of my own making, which is not quite the ca&s;e with his tune. His &s;pectators are regaled with harmony in a brilliant theatre, amid&s;t a blaze of lights; my reader, in his &s;olitary chair, &s;its moping over the dull &s;train of an unintere&s;ting di&s;&s;ertation, which proba|bly has little other merit but of putting him to &s;leep: what in&s;pires his critics with good humour, only &s;tupifies mine.</P>

A nimble &s;cene-painter will da&s;h off a cataract in full froth and foam, that will co&s;t us twenty pages of hard pumping, before we can get a &s;ingle drop to flow: how many pens do we &s;plit in conjuring up a &s;torm of thunder and light|ning, whil&s;t he, by one mark in the margin of his manu&s;cript, &s;ets all the elements in a roar; we find it a very trouble&s;ome job to furni&s;h hor&s;es and carriages for the convey|ance of our company, his characters are wafted from &s;cene to &s;cene by a whi&s;tle; when his heroine is in a cri&s;is, &s;ome one cries,&mdash;<HI>Hah! &s;he faints!</HI>&mdash;and the inimitable Siddons dies away; another cries,&mdash;<HI>Hah! &s;he revives!</HI>&mdash;the inimitable Siddons is alive again.

<HEAD>CHAPTER II. An Adventure on board a Frigate.</HEAD>
<P>WE now return to our hero, who, with fair weather and favouring gales, was far ad|vanced upon his voyage. A few, and but &s;light &s;en&s;ations of unea&s;ine&s;s had attended his initia|tion on &s;hip-board. Cary's gay and gallant &s;pirit cheered him at all moments; the novelty of the &s;cene, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of adventures which occurred to him in pa&s;&s;ing through the Chan|nel, and the &s;triking characters of Briti&s;h &s;ea|men, for ever in his view, were to a mind like his mo&s;t intere&s;ting contemplations. The clean|line&s;s, good order, and di&s;cipline of Cary's fri|gate were exemplary; and as &s;he had cleared the Channel, and was upon the &s;harp look-out for an enemy, expectation kept every body alert, and in a &s;tate of warlike preparation.</P>
<P>Tom Weevil was a lively thoughtle&s;s fellow, and had pa&s;&s;ed through all the di&s;cipline of be|ing &s;eized up to the &s;hrouds, and every other &s;pecies of &s;ea-jokes practi&s;ed upon fre&s;h-water novices, with perfect good-humour. He had
<PB N="224" REF="232">
made acquaintance with &s;everal gentlemen of ea&s;y addre&s;s, particularly in the foretop, with the captain of which, Jack Jones by name, he had e&s;tabli&s;hed a &s;worn friend&s;hip; and as Tom was very fond of taking the air on that elevated &s;tation where Jack pre&s;ided, he was mo&s;tly to be found in the afore&s;aid top, where, in lei&s;ure hours, he edified his company with reading (a gift which he alone po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed) the illu&s;trious hi&s;tory of Robin&s;on Cru&s;oe, to which all ears were open, and univer&s;al faith from all parties &s;ub&s;cribed without re&s;erve. Happy would it be for congregations in gene|ral were they &s;o attentive to their preacher as Tom's audience were to him: they were al&s;o able commentators upon many parts of the work; but as they did not always concur in the &s;ame explanations and remarks, the pro|gre&s;s of the hi&s;tory was liable to con&s;iderable interruptions and cha&s;ms, whil&s;t the interlocu|tory parts were filled up with oaths and lies, given and taken very liberally in the true &s;pi|rit of controver&s;y.</P>
<P>Mr. William Williams, the &s;urgeon (or, in the &s;ea phra&s;e, the doctor) had &s;o ably con|ducted the cure of Henry's wound, by adding nothing to nature's operations but cleanline&s;s
<PB N="225" REF="233">
and fre&s;h lint, that his arm was come to its perfect u&s;e, and, it may be pre&s;umed, his &s;pi|rit was not unwilling to try its &s;trength upon the enemies of his country, if they came in his way. It was now early morning, and that wi&s;hed-for opportunity was in near approach: Henry was on deck, enjoying that mo&s;t mag|nificent of all &s;pectacles, the &s;un ri&s;ing over the waters, a rayle&s;s globe of fire; his heart ex|panded at the &s;ight, and his thoughts a&s;cended towards the Creator of tho&s;e wonders he con|templated. Captain Cary was at pre&s;ent un|der ea&s;y &s;ail, and the weather fine, when the man at the ma&s;t-head de&s;cried a &s;ail a-head: in&s;tantly the officer on watch informed the Captain, who, leaping out of his cot, huddled on his clothes, and in little more time than a lion would be&s;tow upon his toilet, pre&s;ented him&s;elf on the quarter-deck, having ordered all hands up, and &s;ail to be made. A very lit|tle time di&s;covered her to be a &s;quare-rigged ve&s;&s;el, and as &s;he kept her cour&s;e towards Cary, with the wind in her favour, &s;he was &s;oon vi|&s;ible from the deck, where every gla&s;s in the &s;hip was directed towards her, and every voice pronounced her to be a frigate of equal or &s;u|perior force to their own; and, upon a nearer
<PB N="226" REF="234">
view, from certain marks, which experienced &s;eamen are quick in di&s;cerning, &s;he was ad|judged, without one di&s;&s;enting voice, to be an enemy, and an enemy, it &s;hould &s;eem, that did not decline an action.</P>
<P>Now began that aweful arrangement in which &s;ilence &s;till as death prevailed, and every thing moved at the word of one man, who&s;e voice, and none other, was heard, and to who&s;e command ab&s;olute obedience followed on the in&s;tant. Henry &s;urveyed the whole with &s;ilent awe, and reverence for a &s;ervice &s;o conducted: his heart glowed with love and pride for his friend, whom &s;ituation &s;eemed now to have transformed into a new creature; that countenance, which hitherto he had only &s;een charactered with the mirthful &s;mile of raillery and frolic, was now terrible and frown|ing, as he bent his eye upon the enemy, in the &s;ame act of preparation with him&s;elf. He was a perfect hero arming for battle, cou|rage tempered with deliberate circum&s;pection marked every word he &s;aid, which were di&s;|tinctly and preci&s;ely given out in orders to every officer in the &s;hip; the lieutenants re|paired to their quarters, the men a&s;&s;embled in the tops, and hone&s;t Weevil was honoured
<PB N="227" REF="235">
with a po&s;t at one of the cabin-guns, in com|pany with eight other brave fellows. Cary, having hoi&s;ted his colours, addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to his men in a &s;hort but animating &s;peech, that in language &s;uited to their habits and apprehen&s;ions gave them to under&s;tand, that whil&s;t he had breath in his body tho&s;e colours were never to come down; that the advantage of the few guns the enemy had over them was to be compen&s;ated by &s;uperior &s;kill and courage, and he was re&s;olved that republican frigate &s;hould either follow him into a Briti&s;h port or &s;ink along&s;ide of him. This was fol|lowed by three cheers; when, turning to Henry, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Now, my brave Henry, if you like the &s;port, we will give you a ta&s;te of it; this fellow &s;eems to have &s;ome &s;to|mach for fighting, but no great management in bringing it to bear: I &s;ee he means to fight us on the &s;tarboard &s;ide, and has arm'd him&s;elf accordingly; but I &s;hall baulk his fancy, and take him where he is not pre|par'd."</Q> This &s;aid, he gave the word, helm-a-weather, and by a rapid manoeuvre well executed, brought his frigate on the other &s;ide, pouring in a raking fire as he &s;heered acro&s;s him. This manoeuvre produced much
<PB N="228" REF="236">
confu&s;ion and &s;ome lo&s;s to the enemy, who are in the practice of arming only on one &s;ide. The po&s;ition Cary had taken, and the rapidity of his fire, had great effect, as the action was clo&s;e. When the enemy had reco|vered from his &s;urpri&s;e, his behaviour was perfectly gallant; and by &s;omething giving way on board the Briti&s;h frigate, &s;he became unmanageable, and fell broad&s;ide to upon the Frenchman; part of the crew being occupied in repairing this accident, the enemy &s;eized the opportunity for boarding, being full of men. Henry now felt his &s;pirit called upon in a manner not to be re&s;i&s;ted; a confu&s;ed and &s;crambling fight took place upon the gang-way, where the French had lodged them|&s;elves in &s;ome numbers, under conduct of a &s;pirited officer, whom Henry immediately &s;ingled out as his man; he flew to the &s;cene of action &s;word in hand, &s;houting to the peo|ple as he advanced, and at the very fir&s;t &s;troke brought down the leader of the boarding crew, who fell dead into the wa&s;te. Animated by his example, the defendants became invinci|ble, and repul&s;e and &s;laughter en&s;ued: the few that e&s;caped back to their &s;hip were in&s;tantly followed by the victorious party, Henry be|ing
<PB N="229" REF="237">
one of the fir&s;t, if not the very fir&s;t, that leapt on board the national frigate; there was no leader like him to rally the fugitives; in the fir&s;t fury of the on&s;et the carnage was in|di&s;criminate, till a general cry for quarter re|called that mercy which is never long ab&s;ent from the hearts of our countrymen, and &s;topt the hand of death. The colours were hauled down, and three cheers from the conquerors gave notice to their gallant captain and com|rades along&s;ide of them, that they were in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of their prize. A crowd gathered round Henry, who, like Achilles bathed in the blood of Hector, &s;tood in the mid&s;t of them tre|mendou&s;ly beautiful: he had thrown off his coat before he entered into action, his hat had been beaten off, and his hair, Medu&s;a like, fell in wild di&s;order on his forehead, his eyes &s;eemed on fire, the frown yet dwelt upon his brow, and the angry &s;pot of crim&s;on hue &s;till burnt upon his cheek. A confu&s;ion of voices now aro&s;e, all applauding their young volun|teer, with many huggings, and &s;queezings, and &s;lappings on the back, garni&s;hed with oaths of the mo&s;t unaccountable variety, which, through an exce&s;s of good-will, bla&s;ted every limb in the company, and &s;ent our hero him|&s;elf

Among&s;t the&s;e vociferous admirers his eye &s;ingled out a figure in the outward row, whom he di&s;covered to be his friend Tom Weevil, in &s;pite of a &s;mall alteration in his countenance, occa&s;ioned by the removal of one ear and part of a cheek out of their place, and dangling upon his &s;houlder by the help of certain fibres which &s;till re&s;trained them from total &s;eparation. Henry flew to his wounded friend, compre&s;&s;ed the fle&s;hy fragments into their place as well as he could, and taking off his neckcloth, bound them up, and hurried him away to Doctor Williams, whom he found in the cockpit &s;tript to his &s;hirt, with his &s;leeves rolled up to his &s;houlders, and bathed in a mingled &s;tream of blood and &s;weat. <Q REND="inline">"When you can turn your hand,"</Q> cried Hen|ry, <Q REND="inline">"to a brave lad, who wants a little of your art, I &s;hall be oblig'd to you."</Q> A foretop man, one of Weevil's audience, was then under Williams's hands, who &s;eemed in a mo&s;t hope|le&s;s ca&s;e. <Q REND="inline">"It's all up with me,"</Q> cried the dying &s;ailor; <Q REND="inline">"death has &s;topt my grog for everla&s;ting; therefore, do you &s;ee, Doctor, ne|ver break your head about me, but turn your hand to the lad, &s;plice his chops, and &s;end him

<HEAD>CHAPTER III. Our Hero makes an intere&s;ting Di&s;covery.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN our hero had performed the la&s;t offices to the dying &s;ailor, he went upon the quarter-deck, where Captain Cary was bu&s;ily occupied in giving orders upon various matters. The fir&s;t moment he could detach him&s;elf from bu&s;ine&s;s, he ran to Henry, and throwing his arms about him, overwhelmed him with applau&s;es: great was their mutual joy to find that neither had received the &s;light|e&s;t hurt; but what a change did it appear to Henry, as he ca&s;t his eyes about the frigate, late in &s;uch beautiful and perfect trim, now exhibiting nothing but a pent-hou&s;e of dangling rags and mangled rigging overhead, and below, a chaos of broken booms, &s;hattered boats, and decks floated with water black as Styx with the &s;cattering of the powder. When Cary had devoted a few mo|ments to his gallant friend, he called the fir&s;t lieutenant to him, and &s;haking him cordially by the hand, gave him joy of his prize; <Q REND="inline">"Go, my brave fellow,"</Q> he cried, <Q REND="inline">"and take po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
<PB N="233" REF="241">
of that noble frigate, which your va|lour and good conduct has contributed to con|quer; and you, volunteer,"</Q> added he, ad|dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Henry, <Q REND="inline">"go with your of|ficer, and board her for the &s;econd time; but here,"</Q> pointing to his coat, that laid under the barricade, <Q REND="inline">"&s;lip on your clothes, and get a hat."</Q> He then gave directions for &s;hifting the pri&s;oners, and that proper care &s;hould be had of the wounded men, by &s;uperintending the treatment they received from their own &s;urgeons: and now began the carpenter's and boat&s;wain's reports, with a long train of va|rious duties, that fall to the &s;hare of every one in Cary's &s;ituation, and which none were better qualified to execute than he was.</P>
<P>When the fir&s;t lieutenant, accompanied by our hero, came on board the prize, he found the crew and pa&s;&s;engers of a Li&s;bon packet, which &s;he had captured in her cruize, and of the&s;e he bade Henry take charge, whil&s;t he gave atten|tion to more pre&s;&s;ing matters. Henry, now act|ing under orders, immediately began to exert his delegated authority, by a&s;&s;embling his country|men from all parts of the ve&s;&s;el, for the joy|ful purpo&s;e of re&s;toring them to their liberty. When he was about to embark them in the
<PB N="234" REF="242">
boat, that waited to receive them, under the command of Lord Frederick, our young mid|&s;hipman heretofore de&s;cribed, one of the com|pany informed him, there was a &s;ick gentle|man in his hammock below, who&s;e &s;tate of health required in&s;tant attention. To this per|&s;on Henry immediately went, with one of the party for a guide, who brought him to the cable-tier, where the &s;ick gentleman was ly|ing in his hammock, attended by two &s;er|vants. When our hero had imparted to him the cheering purpo&s;e of his vi&s;it, and recom|mended a &s;peedy removal on board the Bri|ti&s;h frigate, where he would be better ac|commodated, he an&s;wered, in a faint tone, that it would be a mo&s;t welcome relea&s;e; he had been tortured with noi&s;e and clamour, and, at the &s;ame time, nearly &s;uffocated with heat and &s;tench; <Q REND="inline">"but &s;urely,"</Q> added he, <Q REND="inline">"I have heard that voice before, tho' I cannot di&s;cern your countenance in this dark place. Is it po&s;&s;ible, Sir, that you and I can have met at Crowbery?"</Q> A &s;hort explanation now took place, which, to Henry's great and joy|ful &s;urpri&s;e, convinced him that Providence had directed him to the re&s;cue of his father. Difficult though it was to &s;uppre&s;s his emo|tion
<PB N="235" REF="243">
on &s;uch a di&s;covery, yet he had com|mand enough over him&s;elf to check his tongue, and immediately began his operations for re|moving him from his loath&s;ome abode, all which he planned and executed with the ten|dere&s;t care and attention. The refre&s;hing &s;en&s;ation of air and motion revived the &s;pi|rits of the redeemed pri&s;oner; he was lifted into the boat in his bedding; Henry's eye watched every movement that could annoy him, Henry's arm &s;upported him through every moment of the pa&s;&s;age, and his care &s;uperintended the operation of getting him on board, where he in&s;tantly a&s;&s;igned him his own cot, and recommended him, in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, to his friend Wil|liams.</P>
<P>So reformed was the appearance of Cary's frigate, that it appeared to Henry as the work of magic; but what cannot Briti&s;h &s;eamen, well commanded, perform? She was now once more in &s;ailing trim, her decks wa&s;hed, and her lumber &s;towed away. Henry deli|vered up his redeemed pri&s;oners, with a li&s;t of their names, to the captain; and, having executed the&s;e in&s;tructions, demanded if there were any further commands for him? <Q REND="inline">"No|thing,
<PB N="236" REF="244">
at pre&s;ent, but to refre&s;h your&s;elf in the cabin,"</Q> replied Cary, <Q REND="inline">"where you will find cold meat and wine, and &s;ome of the national officers at work upon it."</Q> Thither our exhau&s;ted hero eagerly repaired; and, as he was mixing with the pri&s;oners, he heard one of them relating a circum&s;tance of an Engli&s;h de&s;erter, who, being mutinous at his gun in the time of action, and refu&s;ing to &s;erve it again&s;t his countrymen, had been run through the back by one of the officers on the &s;pot. This was told in French, which Henry had enough of the language to under|&s;tand, and, in the &s;ame language, made &s;hift to enquire the name of the renegado. This the Frenchman did not know; but he learnt enough of his &s;tation and de&s;cription in the &s;hip to guide him in the enquiries which his humanity towards a fellow-creature, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, in&s;pired him to make. He therefore &s;natched a ha&s;ty mor&s;el, took a refre&s;hing draught of wine, and jumped into the boat, that was ju&s;t then going off to the prize. Here he &s;oon traced his enquiries to the wretched object he was in &s;earch of, and in whom there appeared &s;o much to pity and condemn. He found him &s;tretched at
<PB N="237" REF="245">
his length upon the bare deck, be&s;ide the gun he had been po&s;ted at, incapable of rai&s;ing him|&s;elf up, floated with his own blood, and at the point of death. Judge, reader, what was Henry's &s;en&s;ation, when, in this expiring wretch, he recognized the features of his ac|quaintance Bow&s;ey. <Q REND="inline">"Ah! mi&s;erable man,"</Q> he cried, <Q REND="inline">"is this your fate at la&s;t? Do you not know me? Speak to me, if you have &s;trength to utter; look on me, if you can lift your eyes, and I will yet give you the la&s;t comfort of knowing that your victim, Thomas Weevil, &s;urvives the blow you dealt him."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Good Lord, good Lord,"</Q> murmured the expiring man; <Q REND="inline">"Wee|vil is alive, then I am no murderer: I know you, Mr. Henry; you are a good man; I wi&s;h I had taken your good coun&s;el, then I had never been in the&s;e damn'd fellows' hands; I am dying, I am dying; I wou'd not fight again&s;t my country; tho' bad enough in all rea&s;on, I was not &s;uch a &s;habby ra&s;cal as that came to, &s;o a &s;coundrel thru&s;t his &s;word into my back, (the devil reward him for it!) and here I've lain ever &s;ince."</Q> Henry &s;aw the agonies of death upon him; he grew con|vul&s;ed at times, then brought out a few words, and &s;eemed &s;truggling to reach out

his hand, which Henry no &s;ooner perceived, than &s;tooping down, he took him by the hand, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Farewel, the Lord have mercy upon you and forgive you."</Q> This was under&s;tood by Bow&s;ey, who, deeply groaning, muttered &s;omething, of which Henry could make out no more than, <HI>Sleep, &s;leep&mdash;they &s;ay it is all &s;leep.</HI>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"They are liars and bla&s;phemers,"</Q> exclaimed Henry, and was proceeding, when he per|ceived the &s;en&s;es he addre&s;&s;ed were clo&s;ed, the la&s;t breath was &s;pent, and the &s;oul had taken flight to tho&s;e unknown regions, where all who credit or inculcate the&s;e impious doc|trines, will be de&s;tined to experience a terrible confutation of their <HI>eternal &s;leep.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IV. Fir&s;t Love &s;trikes deep.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Captain Cary had taken into con&s;ideration the &s;tate of his prize, (a large forty gun frigate) the number of his pri&s;oners, and various other circum&s;tances, which made a &s;eparation unadvi&s;eable, he de|termined to avail him&s;elf of a fair wind, and his proximity to the coa&s;t, for convoying her
<PB N="239" REF="247">
into the fir&s;t Engli&s;h port he cou'd make, though his own de&s;tination was for the Tagus; he therefore made known this his re&s;olution to his officers in each &s;hip, and &s;teered for the channel; the wind continued to &s;erve, and he pu&s;hed into Falmouth, as the fir&s;t port that was favourable to his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Here Henry landed with his father, who &s;till concealed him&s;elf under the name of Smith. The &s;hips took the fir&s;t occa&s;ion for proceeding to Plymouth, where they could receive the nece&s;&s;ary repair, whil&s;t Henry &s;taid with his two convale&s;cents at Falmouth, for Tom Weevil's wound was now, by Williams's &s;kill, far advanced towards a cure. The la&s;t conver&s;ation that Henry held with Williams was on the evening preceding the departure of the &s;hips, when with &s;ome difficulty he pre|vailed upon him to accept a &s;uitable pre&s;ent for his great attention to his own and Weevil's wounds: Mr. Smith, &s;o called, had rewarded him in a more magnificent &s;tile, according to the cu&s;toms of the Ea&s;t. In this conver&s;a|tion Williams, who&s;e mode&s;ty had &s;eldom per|mitted him to &s;peak of him&s;elf and his own adventures, was enticed into a more circum|&s;tantial detail of pa&s;t occurrences, which it
<PB N="240" REF="248">
imports not this hi&s;tory to record in any other period, than that in which he was employed as an a&s;&s;i&s;tant to our acquaintance Zachary Cawdle at Crowbery, where the youthful charms of Su&s;an May, then in their fir&s;t blo&s;|&s;om, made &s;ad havock with Williams's &s;u&s;|ceptible heart. It did not appear, even from his own mode&s;t account, that Su&s;an was al|together inexorable, for Williams was a very hand&s;ome fellow, with a thou&s;and good qua|lities, and, over all, one of the &s;weete&s;t tempers man ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, but there were rubs in|numerable, which fortune perver&s;ely threw in the way of his pa&s;&s;ion that Williams had not &s;kill or confidence to &s;truggle with: the chief of the&s;e had root in Jemima's jealou&s;y and &s;pite, &s;ome &s;prung from hone&s;t Zachary him&s;elf, who thought love no great recom|mendation in a compounder of medicines; and others were thrown in his way by the collu&s;ion of Blachford with Dame Jemima, the bright eyes of the dam&s;el having &s;et fire to the bilious particles of the Ju&s;tice's blood in no le&s;s degree than to the milky ones of Williams. To extricate him&s;elf from this dilemma by deliberate means required more nerves than Williams had to &s;pare, he there|fore
<PB N="241" REF="249">
took quicker but le&s;s regular mea&s;ures, and fairly e&s;caped by flight, taking nothing away with him but an aching heart, and de|frauding his ma&s;ter of no one tittle of his right, &s;ave only of the plea&s;ure of paying him cer|tain running arrears of wages, which Williams probably had neither time nor inclination to demand.</P>
<P>When Williams had concluded his narra|tive, Henry re&s;olved fir&s;t to try the pul&s;e of his affection, before he threw the lure of Su|&s;an's fortune in his way, and this he rightly conceived to be the mo&s;t honourable proceed|ing to both parties. He therefore began to di&s;cour&s;e with him in &s;uch a way as might be&s;t di&s;cover how far Su&s;an &s;till kept any hold upon the heart of her fir&s;t lover, and when this was made clear to him, he proceed|ed to unfold the dark tran&s;action which Blach|ford had been concerned in, and the con&s;e|quences it had produced. Here Williams, no longer able to re&s;train him&s;elf, broke out into violent denunciations again&s;t her betrayer, taking Heaven to witne&s;s, that whenever op|portunity &s;hould &s;erve, he would have his re|venge upon him for what he had done; but this Henry &s;oon put a &s;top to, by informing
<PB N="242" REF="250">
him how completely the offender was now out of his reach. <Q REND="inline">"It is an exit too good for &s;uch a villain,"</Q> cried Williams, <Q REND="inline">"he &s;hou'd have died by the halter, or, if the law cou'd not have reach'd him, my arm &s;hou'd; but though his life is out of my reach, his memory is not, and I will vindicate the innocent again&s;t the guilty, by making public the truth, and &s;haring my la&s;t &s;hilling in &s;upport of my poor girl, wherever &s;he can be found, and to what|ever &s;ituation &s;he may be reduc'd."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"That is a re&s;olution,"</Q> &s;aid Henry, <Q REND="inline">"every way worthy of you, and be&s;peaks a generous &s;oul; it al&s;o convinces me that you lov'd her ho|nourably, and e&s;teem'd her worthy of your love."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"And &s;he is worthy &s;till,"</Q> rejoined he. <Q REND="inline">"Can I love her le&s;s becau&s;e &s;he has &s;uffer'd wrong and violence from the blacke&s;t wretch that ever breath'd? No, I &s;hou'd be ba&s;e as he is if I cou'd; but I am impatient to know what has been her fate, and how &s;he has &s;truggled under mi&s;ery &s;o compli|cated."</Q> This drew out that account, which no relater but one of Henry's delicacy of &s;en|timent would have re&s;erved for the conclu|&s;ion of his &s;tory; and though it may be well believed the facts now recounted were not
<PB N="243" REF="251">
embelli&s;hed with any &s;elf-encomiums, yet the colde&s;t colour he could give to truth could not prevent his hearer from receiving it with tran&s;ports of admiration and gratitude.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Oh Heavens!"</Q> cried Williams, <Q REND="inline">"what a &s;oul is yours? And have you ri&s;qued a life &s;o precious in a voluntary combat with tho&s;e madmen? God be prais'd, the villains have not drawn one drop of blood from your veins! well might we conquer, who were headed by an angel."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Stop,"</Q> cried Henry; <Q REND="inline">"we will talk common &s;en&s;e, if you plea&s;e, and treat each other like rational creatures. I have been telling you mere matter of fact, and as you &s;eem to take a warm &s;hare in our friend Su&s;an's intere&s;t, &s;o far my &s;tory has repaid you for the pains it gave you in &s;ome parts, by the plea&s;ure you receive in the conclu&s;ion of it. When your duty permits, and your incli|nation di&s;po&s;es you to make a trip to Crow|bery, you will find your old acquaintance re|&s;pectably e&s;tabli&s;h'd; and if you &s;ee her with my eyes, and judge of her as I think you mu&s;t, I per&s;uade my&s;elf you will find no one charm of per&s;on, or good quality of heart, impair'd by what has pa&s;s'd &s;ince you lo&s;t &s;ight of her: and now a thought &s;trikes me,
<PB N="244" REF="252">
Mr. Williams, as a hint for you to turn in your mind, which is &s;imply this; your old friend Zachary Cawdle is now from home upon a &s;ervice, which, I have rea&s;on to be|lieve, will &s;et him free from bu&s;ine&s;s for the re&s;t of his days; &s;hou'd this be the ca&s;e, and if you prefer a &s;tationary employ to a roving one like your pre&s;ent, it is not improbable but means may be taken for &s;ettling you in his bu&s;ine&s;s, if the &s;pot is agreeable to you, and the object worth your thoughts."</Q> To this Williams an&s;wered, that the &s;ituation in|deed would be very de&s;irable; but he doubted his capacity of obtaining it, for he had no money, nor was in the way of getting any.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Then I perceive,"</Q> quoth Henry, <Q REND="inline">"my good friend, you have no pre&s;ent thoughts of mar|rying."</Q> Williams blu&s;hed and was &s;ilent.

<P>THE next day Captain Cary took his de|parture for Plymouth, carrying his prize with him. Some time would be nece&s;&s;ary for repairing the damages his frigate had re|ceived in the action, and this determined Henry to &s;tay at Falmouth, not only for the purpo&s;e of attending upon his father, but in the hope of hearing &s;ome tidings of Lady Crowbery, who&s;e arrival might now be looked for from day to day. Mr. Smith had taken lodgings in a private hou&s;e, and was recover|ing his &s;trength apace: to him Henry re|paired, after his conver&s;ation with Williams above related, and found a chai&s;e waiting at his door for a morning airing. His tender attentions had &s;o won the heart of his uncon|&s;cious father, that he &s;eemed to live only in his company, and as this airing was a fir&s;t effort, Henry offered to attend upon him in the carriage, which was mo&s;t thankfully ac|cepted. The driver was directed to chu&s;e

the &s;moothe&s;t road, and go gently along; the &s;ick man's &s;pirits were revived by the air and motion, and now for the fir&s;t time he found &s;trength to conver&s;e more at large, than as yet he had been able to do.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Your good|ne&s;s to me, dear &s;ir,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"has been &s;uch as I can never find words to expre&s;s my &s;en&s;e of: I have hitherto been &s;ilent, not through want of gratitude but want of powers to give utterance to it; yet I have much to &s;ay to you, &s;ome things to explain, and others to apologize for. In the fir&s;t place I &s;hou'd tell you, that in all our ca&s;ual rencounters, &s;ince the fir&s;t time we met, when I pretended to have pick'd up a ring of Lady Crowbery's, I have been impo&s;ing my&s;elf upon you under a feign'd name and character: I am the third &s;on now living of the Lord Pendennis, my name Henry Delapoer; a very early attach|ment to the lovelie&s;t of her &s;ex being mo&s;t unfortunately traver&s;ed by her father decided my fate, and hurried me to the Ea&s;t Indies, with a broken heart, upon a de&s;perate adven|ture. It was the will of providence I &s;hou'd &s;urvive my lo&s;s of happine&s;s, by turning a&s;ide from me in various ways, almo&s;t miraculous, that death which I pre&s;umptuou&s;ly courted.
<PB N="247" REF="255">
As my heart never varied from its fir&s;t affec|tion, I never have had a thought of marrying; and though I have been little &s;tudious of ac|cumulating money, yet circum&s;tances, un&s;ought for on my part, have thrown a fortune upon me, which, though not to be compar'd with many, is an affluent one, and, which is better, fairly earn'd, without cruelty or extortion. Having now di&s;clos'd to you who I am, I &s;hall next inform you of my purpo&s;e in &s;et|ting out for Li&s;bon, in which undertaking I &s;u&s;pect it will be found that we have both the &s;ame object, namely, that of tendering our la&s;t melancholy offices to the much injured lady of that execrable tyrant Crowbery; of your motives, my dear Sir, I know no more than common report has given out, and they do credit to your gratitude, for I have heard &s;he has been a beneficent and kind friend to you, and I cannot doubt but &s;he has acted on the pure&s;t principles; how it comes to pa&s;s that I am &s;o affected by her &s;ituation, and en|rag'd again&s;t her oppre&s;&s;or, a &s;ingle word will explain, when I tell you &s;he was all but my wedded wife, when her inexorable father over|took us, in the la&s;t &s;tage of our progre&s;s to|wards Gretna Green, and ob&s;tinately &s;ever'd

that knot which a very few hours wou'd have made indi&s;&s;oluble. Merciful Heaven! what a heart-rending moment was that, which tore me from the arms of my Cecilia! Oh!

What might have been the re&s;ult of it I can well conceive; what it was Heaven only knows; for I was hurried out of England, and remain'd in ignorance of her fate; and now I find her wedded to a brute, childle&s;s, unhappy, and alas! far gone in a decay. If providence &s;hall graciou&s;ly permit her to &s;ur|vive her voyage, Li&s;bon gives me one la&s;t chance of meeting her on this &s;ide Heaven; if not, the &s;hort remnant of days that may be left to me &s;hall be &s;pent in bewailing her lo&s;s, and, if opportunity can be found, in avenging her wrongs."</Q></P>
<P>Here the father cea&s;ed, exhau&s;ted not le&s;s by the agitation of his mind, than by the ex|ertion of his di&s;cour&s;e; a &s;hort &s;ilence took place, which Henry was too con&s;iderate of his repo&s;e to interrupt; at length perceiving that he expected a reply, he &s;poke as follows,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I am greatly honour'd by the confidence

I am not totally uninformed of Lady Crowbery's early attachment to the honourable Captain Dela|poer, my life from infancy to a period not long pa&s;s'd having been &s;pent under the care and tuition of a mo&s;t intimate friend of her's, the Reverend Mr. Ratcliffe, lately deceas'd; by that excellent man I was receiv'd as a de|&s;erted namele&s;s infant, depo&s;ited at his door, and recommended to his benevolent protec|tion by my my&s;terious mother. Through &s;ome &s;ecret channel, unknown to me, the charges of my maintenance were &s;upplied, when at his death they &s;topt at once, and I was thrown friendle&s;s and helple&s;s on the world at large. Misfortunes, which at &s;ome other time I will detail to you, fell upon me, pre&s;&s;ing me down to the extremity of human
<PB N="250" REF="258">
mi&s;ery and di&s;tre&s;s; in this &s;tate the charity of Lady Crowbery found me; her bounty to me drew the malice of her tyrant into open acts of oppre&s;&s;ion, loading her with calumny mo&s;t gro&s;s and injurious, and racking her too &s;en&s;itive feelings, till her tender frame gave way, and &s;unk under the attack; it is to me, therefore, belongs the puni&s;hment of that mon|&s;ter, for it is I who have been made the plea and apology for his abominable cruelty. Her death, which Heaven avert, wou'd &s;et my hands at liberty, and as I have an au&s;picious impre&s;&s;ion on my mind that time will &s;hortly reveal the pre&s;ent my&s;tery of my birth, I may then be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a name cowardice cannot &s;hrink from; and when his pride can no longer &s;helter it&s;elf in the ob&s;curity of my per&s;on, his cunning will no longer be able to evade the terror of my appeal. Here then you &s;ee the motives of my journey to Li&s;bon, and rightly &s;ugge&s;t that they are in &s;ome re|&s;pects congenial with your own. Undimi|ni&s;hed affection on your part, and ardent gra|titude on mine, attract us to the &s;ame point; and this being the ca&s;e, I &s;hou'd humbly con|ceive it will be our mutual wi&s;h to wait her arrival in this port, and, if &s;he has no objec|tion,
<PB N="251" REF="259">
to embark with her in the &s;ame packet, if your health &s;erves for the undertaking."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You &s;peak my wi&s;hes correctly,"</Q> re|plied the father; <Q REND="inline">"and as for my health, it is &s;o &s;econdary an object, compared to her's, that I do not &s;uffer it to occupy a &s;ingle thought."</Q> As the&s;e words were uttering, a chai&s;e came in &s;ight, followed by another, and by two &s;er|vants on hor&s;eback. Henry &s;tarted at the &s;ight, and exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"My God! here is the very lady her&s;elf."</Q> Then calling to the po&s;til|lion to &s;top, he ha&s;tily opened the door of the chai&s;e, and leaping out, planted him&s;elf by the &s;ide of the road, which it was nece&s;|&s;ary for the approaching carriages to take.</P>
<P>Henry, though greatly agitated, was not wanting in &s;ufficient pre&s;ence of mind to be cautious in his mode of &s;topping Lady Crow|bery's carriage, which he did as gently and as &s;ilently as he could contrive. When he pre&s;ented him&s;elf at the window, the exhau&s;ted traveller had rai&s;ed her&s;elf up to enquire into the cau&s;e of the &s;top, when immediately as her eyes lighted on the face of her &s;on, the blood ru&s;hed into her faded cheeks, and &s;he exclaimed&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"My Henry! my Henry! is it po&s;&s;ible?"</Q> and was proceeding; when, to &s;ave her from un&s;ea&s;on|able
<PB N="252" REF="260">
exertions, he told his &s;tory in as few words as po&s;&s;ible, omitting for the pre&s;ent the circum&s;tance of his meeting with his father, who remained in his chai&s;e, drawn out of the road at &s;ome di&s;tance.</P>
<P>He had taken the precaution to &s;ecure her quiet apartments in a private hou&s;e, and hav|ing directed her drivers to follow his chai&s;e, he left her, and returned to his father, whom he found in great agitation of &s;pirits. It was agreed between them that Henry &s;hould pre|pare Lady Crowbery, before Mr. Delapoer attempted to &s;ee her; and as &s;oon therefore as he had entered the town he quitted the chai&s;e, and conducted Lady Crowbery's peo|ple to the door of the hou&s;e he had taken for her.</P>
<P>Here &s;he alighted, and between Henry and Doctor Cawdle was conducted to her apart|ment, which, pre&s;enting her with a fine view of the &s;ea, and being both in point of a&s;pect and interior accommodations much to her liking, &s;eemed to have the effect of reviving her &s;pirits, exhilarated no doubt by the &s;ight, above all others, of her beloved Henry.</P>

let out the circum&s;tance, hitherto &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by Henry, of the action Cary had had, which he had picked up by report upon the road, but prudently forbore to &s;peak of. This forced our hero upon a narrative of the whole affair, in which he took not the glory to him|&s;elf that was due, but in all other particulars was a very correct relater of facts. Zachary now began his journal, and travelled very cir|cum&s;tantially from London to Falmouth, com|menting upon his own &s;agacious proceedings by the way, to which he very ju&s;tly a&s;cribed the &s;ucce&s;s that had hitherto crowned his ope|rations; and certain it was, the health and &s;trength of the lady did not appear, to Henry's ob&s;ervation, to have &s;uffered much, if any, diminution by the journey. A re&s;torative was now admini&s;tered, on which Zachary de|&s;canted with much learning, and at the &s;ame time pronounced, that a repo&s;e of &s;ome days would be indi&s;pen&s;ible for her Lady&s;hip's &s;afety, before &s;he embarked on board the packet. A fre&s;h &s;upply of certain drugs being wanted, he &s;allied forth in &s;earch of a proper &s;hop, from whence to repleni&s;h his &s;tock. As &s;oon as he was gone, the mother being left with her &s;on, threw her arms about his neck,
<PB N="254" REF="262">
and gave full vent to tho&s;e exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ations which nature and affection, hitherto repre&s;&s;ed, had implanted in her &s;oul. Moments &s;o free and mutually delicious they had never yet enjoyed; they exchanged embraces and min|gled tears, till Henry, recollecting that even joy may be too violent, gently extricated him|&s;elf from her embrace, ro&s;e from her feet where he was kneeling, and having &s;eated him&s;elf at her &s;ide, cla&s;ping one of her hands in his, &s;he began a conver&s;ation, which will be recorded in the following chapter.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"I HAVE receiv'd a letter,"</Q> &s;aid the Lady Crowbery, <Q REND="inline">"from my uncle Man|&s;tock, which occa&s;ion'd me to make a longer &s;tay in London than I &s;hould el&s;e have made; it obliged me to &s;end down my lawyer, to receive from his hands the packet contain|ing my will and other papers, which I had depo&s;ited with him. What particular rea&s;ons he had for declining a tru&s;t, that he had wil|lingly

If, then, my uncle will &s;urrender up his un|der&s;tanding to that unworthy guide, can I help it? I have appointed my executor, and &s;hall put into your hands a copy of my will, with full directions where to apply for the original, which I have lodg'd with Mr. G&mdash;, of Gray's Inn, a man in who&s;e integrity the mo&s;t &s;acred tru&s;t may be repos'd. But how far this change of opinion in Sir Roger Man|&s;tock may affect his amiable daughter is a que&s;tion of very &s;erious concern; for, if I un|der&s;tand his letter rightly, you are put un|der ab&s;olute pro&s;cription; nor do I expect &s;he will be allow'd to corre&s;pond with me, unle&s;s my letters are &s;ubmitted to in&s;pection before they reach her hands; and as for her writing to me, I do not &s;uppo&s;e &s;he will be &s;uffer'd to do it on any account; you &s;ee, therefore, in what light you &s;tand; and, ac|cording

<P><Q REND="inline">"That is an attempt,"</Q> replied Henry; <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall never make; for that wou'd be to ruin my&s;elf both in her e&s;teem and my own. In|terdicted by her father, I am excluded from all hope; at the &s;ame time, if I know my own heart, I know that time can work no change in its affections; and if I am totally to de&s;pair of I&s;abella, &s;o long as it &s;hall plea&s;e Heaven to impo&s;e upon a wretched creature life bereft of all happine&s;s, &s;o long I &s;hall, with all the re&s;ignation that becomes me, en|dure the di&s;pen&s;ation; for it is not my nature to rebel again&s;t my Creator."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I perceive,"</Q> &s;aid the mother, <Q REND="inline">"that your love, my dear Henry, lies deep, and is immoveable; ha&s;ty pa&s;&s;ions wa&s;te them&s;elves in vehement a&s;&s;everations; the flame burns

out, and there's an end to them, but your's is fixt deliberate approbation, therefore I &s;hall not argue again&s;t it; on the contrary, I mu&s;t confe&s;s to you, that before I parted from I&s;abella, I confided to her the &s;ecret of your birth; I own'd my&s;elf your mother, and di&s;clos'd to her the whole purport of tho&s;e pa|pers, which I depo&s;ited with her father, to be opened only on the event of my decea&s;e. She knows you, therefore, for the &s;on of Dela|poer, the heir of my e&s;tate, and, perhaps, of his fortune, if he has returned, as I am in|form'd, without connections, and in affluent circum&s;tances. In her heart, therefore, I &s;hou'd flatter my&s;elf you will keep your place, unle&s;s my uncle &s;hou'd extort from her any promi&s;e to your ab&s;olute exclu&s;ion. In the mean time, I cou'd wi&s;h, before I die, to obtain, if po&s;&s;ible, an interview with your father, who is uncon&s;cious of your exi&s;tence, and which might have taken place but for the provoking over&s;ight of hone&s;t Cawdle, who forgot to give you my note with the ring. Whil&s;t I was in London, I caus'd enquiry to be made after Delapoer; I was inform'd he remained unmarried, had pre&s;erv'd an excel|lent character, and brought home a re&s;pect|able
<PB N="258" REF="266">
fortune, very honourably acquir'd; he was not in town, nor was it exactly known where he was gone, for he had neither hou&s;e nor &s;ervants in London, and the report was, that he was going out of England for the winter, to a warmer climate. It occurs to me, therefore, that if he has heard of my be|ing order'd to Li&s;bon, he may po&s;&s;ibly make that his point."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And &s;hou'd you be well pleas'd if it was &s;o?"</Q> demanded Henry.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I confe&s;s to you, I &s;hou'd not be &s;orry,"</Q> replied the lady, <Q REND="inline">"for the rea&s;ons I have already &s;tated."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Then I may venture to inform you,"</Q> &s;aid Henry, <Q REND="inline">"that he was with me in the chai&s;e when I met you on the road."</Q> At the&s;e words the blood ru&s;hed into the cheeks of the feeble in|valid, her eyes &s;parkled with joy, and &s;he ex|claimed with unu&s;ual energy, <Q REND="inline">"How wonder|ful are the ways of Providence! What an un|expected ble&s;&s;ing, that I am now permitted to be a happy in&s;trument of a di&s;covery like this! Let me &s;ee him without lo&s;s of time; let me not po&s;tpone, even for an hour, a duty &s;o im|portant, an opportunity &s;o graciou&s;ly offered. I take for granted, you have not declared your&s;elf to him."</Q> He a&s;&s;ured her he had

<P>Henry was gone whil&s;t the words were on her lips: &s;he immediately gave orders to her &s;ervants to prevent interruption, and then be|gan to collect her thoughts for the awful in|terview. Whil&s;t &s;he reflected on the extraor|dinary combination of events that had brought about this unexpected meeting, it in&s;pired her to hope, that Heaven had &s;ealed her pardon for the pa&s;t offences of her youth, and brought her &s;ufferings to a period. When &s;he endea|voured to put her thoughts into &s;ome form of words, and prepare for the di&s;covery &s;he had to make, &s;he found her&s;elf incapable of arranging her ideas, and gave up the attempt. <Q REND="inline">"It is in vain,"</Q> &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline">"to meditate on what I am to &s;ay; I mu&s;t leave it to nature and the impul&s;e of the moment."</Q> And now the voice of Henry in the hou&s;e warned her of his approach; and &s;oon &s;he heard the &s;teps of two men upon the &s;tairs; when the door be|ing opened, pre&s;ented to her view the &s;ickly and emaciated form of Delapoer, leaning on the arm of his conductor, trembling as he advanced towards her, and panting for breath
<PB N="260" REF="268">
through faintne&s;s and agitation. Henry in|&s;tantly retired: not a word was uttered by either of the parties; &s;he made an effort to rai&s;e her&s;elf from her &s;eat, but &s;unk back, and, putting her hands before her face, bur&s;t into tears. There was a chair be&s;ide her, in which Delapoer &s;ate down. <Q REND="inline">"How &s;hall I expre&s;s my thanks to you,"</Q> he &s;aid, after a &s;hort pau&s;e, <Q REND="inline">"for this indulgence? Providence &s;eems to have brought us together, by the mo&s;t ex|traordinary means, in the la&s;t &s;cene of our life's &s;ad tragedy, that we may once more exchange a parting look upon the ruins of time before we &s;eparate to our unchangeable de&s;tinations. Your lot, my ever-beloved lady, I am per&s;uaded will be ble&s;t; you have la|bour'd much, and will reap abundantly, I &s;natch'd a &s;ight of you at Crowbery; it was too much for an exhau&s;ted frame; I have been &s;inking ever &s;ince; for I heard you was un|happy, and my heart ro&s;e again&s;t your ty|rant, tho' di&s;cretion &s;topt my hand. I pa&s;s'd &s;everal days about the purlieus of your ca&s;tle, di&s;gui&s;ing both my name and habit, le&s;t I might awaken the &s;u&s;picion of your gaoler: I met that excellent young man, who accom|pany'd me hither, and &s;ent you a pledge by
<PB N="261" REF="269">
his hands, which I thought you wou'd under|&s;tand as a token I was yet alive. Ever &s;ince the inexorable decree that tore us from each other, I have been &s;truggling with my hard fortune, in the hope of earning, by my &s;word and &s;ervices, a competency to enable me to return an independent man; but alas! a va|riety of cro&s;&s;es and misfortunes bore &s;o &s;trong upon me for a cour&s;e of eighteen years, that, until the la&s;t few months of my abode in In|dia, I was toiling again&s;t the &s;tream of adver|&s;ity; at length, one lucky expedition, of which I had the conduct, pre&s;ented to me the alter|native of enormous plunder with a guilty con&s;cience, or moderate earnings with a clear one; I cho&s;e the latter, and am now return'd, affluent in circum&s;tances, and, I thank God, ir|reproachable in character. Never, during this tedious period, did the eye of beauty, Indian or Engli&s;h, draw a&s;ide one thought, one wi&s;h, one, even the &s;lighte&s;t, regard, from the cen|ter where fir&s;t love, and the memory of my ever-ador'd Cecilia, had fixt it for life. The vow that I had made, &s;o &s;eal'd, &s;o &s;anctify'd, &s;o rivetted into the very heart of honour, was to me a marriage vow&mdash;but, I perceive, I give you pain; let me not do that; my ex|pre&s;&s;ions,
<PB N="262" REF="270">
tho' &s;trong, were only binding on my&s;elf; you was not free; you had a father, whom you was forc'd to obey, and, I implore you to believe they were not pointed again&s;t your proceeding; I can well &s;uppo&s;e your marriage with a wretch like Crowbery was a compul&s;ory one."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It was, indeed,"</Q> replied &s;he, rai&s;ing her eyes for the fir&s;t time, and turning them upon him in the mo&s;t affecting manner; <Q REND="inline">"it was impos'd upon me, not only as a command, which I cou'd not di&s;obey, but as an atone|ment for an offence, which I cou'd no other|wi&s;e expiate."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Gracious Heaven!"</Q> he exclaimed; <Q REND="inline">"and was my unhappy Cecilia made to atone for an offence, for which I, vile betrayer as I was, am alone re&s;pon&s;ible? It is I, then, who am the &s;ource of all your &s;orrows; I, to who&s;e uncea&s;ing &s;olicitations your kind heart at la&s;t reluctantly gave way; I have been the hateful cau&s;e of all your &s;ufferings, like the deceiver of our fir&s;t parents, the father of all evil."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not &s;o,"</Q> rejoined &s;he ha&s;tily; <Q REND="inline">"&s;ay, ra|ther, you have been the father of my only ble&s;&s;ing."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="271"><Q REND="inline">"What do you mean?"</Q> he exclaimed, in a tone of impatience and &s;urpri&s;e. <Q REND="inline">"Speak to me, I be&s;eech you, without re&s;erve; lead me the &s;traite&s;t way to truth, for you have &s;tir'd a thought within my heart that will not bear eva&s;ion or delay. Am I a father? an|&s;wer me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are, you are a father,"</Q> &s;he replied; <Q REND="inline">"and Henry is your &s;on."</Q></P>
<P>As &s;he &s;poke the&s;e words, Delapoer's &s;en&s;es &s;eemed lo&s;t in a&s;toni&s;hment; he &s;mote his hands together in a tran&s;port of joy, gazed upon her eagerly for a while, then ca&s;t his eyes to Hea|ven; his lips moved, but no voice was heard; then throwing him&s;elf back in his chair, he &s;eemed lo&s;t in meditation, till, rou&s;ed to &s;ud|den recollection, he adjured her, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn terms, to confirm the truth of what &s;he had told him by an appeal to Heaven. <Q REND="inline">"I take Heaven to witne&s;s,"</Q> &s;he replied, <Q REND="inline">"to the truth of what I have &s;aid; con&s;cious as I am that the Judge is at the door, in who&s;e pre&s;ence I mu&s;t &s;oon appear, I repeat to you, at the peril of my &s;oul, were I capable of de|ceit, that Henry is your &s;on and mine."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I am &s;atisfied,"</Q> cried Delapoer; and, dropping on his knees, broke forth into prayers and

prai&s;es to the Supreme Di&s;po&s;er of all events. She then imparted to him the purport of her will, and briefly related what had pa&s;&s;ed be|tween her uncle and her&s;elf &s;ince her departure from Man&s;tock. When he found &s;he had confided the &s;ecret to no one but I&s;abella, ex|cept Henry him&s;elf and Zachary, who was profe&s;&s;ionally made privy to it, he pau&s;ed for &s;ome time, and then demanded, why he alone might not &s;tand forth to the world as the father of Henry, without committing her name in any future time. <Q REND="inline">"Let it remain a my&s;tery,"</Q> he &s;aid; <Q REND="inline">"or, at mo&s;t, a &s;urmi&s;e. Why &s;hou'd we give that triumph to the malice of Lord Crowbery? why &s;hou'd we put to &s;hame the family pride of Sir Roger Man&s;tock? I have fortune enough to be&s;tow upon my &s;on; and the fir&s;t lawyer that is capable of drawing a deed of gift &s;hall &s;ecure the rever&s;ion of my whole property to him. As for your paternal e&s;tate, bequeath it in it's natural cour&s;e, &s;o that no &s;u&s;picion re&s;t upon your memory."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Your &s;ugge&s;tion,"</Q> &s;aid the lady, <Q REND="inline">"is truly generous; but it is far too important to be adopted without due reflection: my uncle Man&s;tock has but one child, and &s;he a daugh|ter; &s;he is already &s;uperabundantly endow'd;
<PB N="265" REF="273">
and to accumulate e&s;tates upon the heire&s;s of that wealthy hou&s;e, is mere &s;upererogation; unle&s;s our Henry, who is ma&s;ter of her affec|tions, was as much in favour with the fa|ther."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Cannot it be left conditionally, upon her marrying Henry?"</Q> &s;aid Delapoer.&mdash;Lady Crowbery &s;hook her head, and remarked, that this would little differ, in appearance to the world, from an ab&s;olute beque&s;t to him. <Q REND="inline">"Yet if I cou'd depend,"</Q> added &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"upon her at|tachment to Henry, or, rather, I &s;hou'd &s;ay, upon her father's con&s;ent, all might be well; and my &s;on, thro' her medium, wou'd &s;till be my heir: but there is little reliance on my uncle, whil&s;t he is under influence ho&s;tile to my wi&s;hes."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Did you not &s;ay,"</Q> he rejoined, <Q REND="inline">"that Mi&s;s Man&s;tock was privy to the &s;ecret of our Henry's birth? If &s;o, it is to be pre&s;um'd, you have perfect confidence in her honour; you al&s;o believe &s;he is attach'd to him, el&s;e you wou'd not have tru&s;ted her with an un|nece&s;&s;ary &s;ecret: how then can this young lady, knowing Henry to be your &s;on, act otherwi&s;e by your e&s;tate than either &s;hare it

<P><Q REND="inline">"There is much argument,"</Q> &s;he replied, <Q REND="inline">"in what you &s;ay; and, I believe, more true honour does not exi&s;t in a human heart, than in my cou&s;in I&s;abella's; but, after all, we mu&s;t talk with Henry."</Q> This was the mo&s;t im|mediate wi&s;h of Delapoer's heart, who was longing to embrace a &s;on ju&s;tly &s;o dear to him;&mdash;and now he recited to Lady Crowbery the whole narrative of the action, dwelling with rapture upon the bravery and humanity of our hero: the &s;en&s;ations it produced in a mother's heart need not be de&s;cribed, and it is well they need not, for I &s;hould doubt if they can.</P>

<P>OUR readers need not be reminded, that the hero of this hi&s;tory knew Delapoer to be his father before he was called to a con|ference upon the propo&s;al &s;tated in the pre|ceding chapter. The meeting took place in Lady Crowbery's pre&s;ence; and the namele&s;s foundling, whom adver&s;ity had &s;o lately cru&s;h|ed, now heard him&s;elf acknowledged, and felt the animating pre&s;&s;ure of a parental embrace, by turns be&s;towed upon him, with prai&s;es, prayers and ble&s;&s;ings, &s;uperadded in abun|dance.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Son,"</Q> cried Lady Crowbery, <Q REND="inline">"it has now pleas'd Heaven to let me &s;ee this hour, which clo&s;es every wi&s;h that my fond heart conceiv'd, and ble&s;&s;es me beyond what I have ever merited, or can compute. I have lived
<PB N="268" REF="276">
to place you in the protection of a father, I have &s;urviv'd to behold you cla&s;p'd in his em|brace; and what can I &s;ay&mdash;but that the tran&s;|port is unutterable? A term of life beyond what may &s;uffice to execute the few mater|nal ties that are yet unfini&s;hed, is what I dare not, what I do not pray for, Let us not therefore loiter, for the time is &s;hort; let us work while it is day, for darkne&s;s and death are at hand. There is a bu&s;ine&s;s to be done, upon which I mu&s;t con&s;ult you. My paternal e&s;tate is, as you know, in my di&s;po&s;al; it is your's: on whom but on my &s;on can I be&s;tow it?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Not &s;o,"</Q> replied Henry; <Q REND="inline">"be&s;towing it on me, you avow me as your &s;on, and be|queath your name to detraction and di&s;grace. Suppo&s;e (which Heaven forbid!) Lord Crow|bery &s;urvives you, what will he &s;ay? outra|geous in&s;ult to your memory will en&s;ue: this may be repell'd, you'll &s;ay; but what can be oppos'd to Sir Roger Man&s;tock's di&s;con|tent? If he will not &s;uffer you to leave a paper in his hands, upon the &s;u&s;picion only of my name being found in it, how will he re|&s;ent a will, that is to make me the heir of your e&s;tate, to the exclu&s;ion of his family?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"And if I&s;abella inherits it,"</Q> &s;aid the mo|ther,
<PB N="269" REF="277">
<Q REND="inline">"what then?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Then &s;he who be&s;t de&s;erves it, has it,"</Q> replied Henry; <Q REND="inline">"and as no earthly ble&s;&s;ing can accrue to me, but what originates with her, you put my fate into her hands, who is the mi&s;tre&s;s of it, whether you &s;o con&s;ider her, or not. To her I am known; by her alone I can be made happy; if I have any intere&s;t dear to me upon earth, it is to recommend my&s;elf to her thoughts; and, therefore, what can be&s;t do that, is be&s;t for my intere&s;t: let the lovely I&s;abella then po&s;|&s;e&s;s what &s;he is entitled to, of which, if any &s;hare devolves to me, let her be&s;tow it with her&s;elf: I cannot be too rich in fortune's gifts, with I&s;abella to partake of them; without her I &s;hall be beyond the reach of fortune, no|thing can le&s;&s;en or augment my wretched|ne&s;s."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh, my dear &s;on,"</Q> cried Delapoer, <Q REND="inline">"how perfectly you &s;peak my &s;entiments! I adopt your rea&s;oning, nay, rather, I anticipate it, for it is exactly what I recommended to your beloved mother. I have enough, and all I have is your's."</Q></P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s was no further pre&s;&s;ed, for the conference had been long, and Lady Crow|bery &s;eemed exhau&s;ted: &s;he was &s;ilent, but it
<PB N="270" REF="278">
was a &s;ilence that betokened acquie&s;cence. As the bu&s;ine&s;s could not be done to her &s;ati&s;|faction without the pre&s;ence of her confiden|tial lawyer Mr. G&mdash;, who was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of papers, which, according to this plan, it behoved her to cancel, &s;he determined to write to him by expre&s;s, and reque&s;t him to come down to her, if his bu&s;ine&s;s admitted of it, in per&s;on, el&s;e to di&s;patch &s;ome tru&s;ty and &s;uffi|cient proxy, who might act in his place: the intermediate time was not longer than &s;eemed requi&s;ite for her ca&s;e, which now became more and more doubtful; for Zachary, who began to a&s;&s;ume a very pen&s;ive a&s;pect, had taken a medical a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or into council, and both joined in pronouncing that unle&s;s &s;ome favourable and &s;peedy change took place, the project of em|barking her for Li&s;bon mu&s;t be abandoned. Delapoer and Henry &s;aw the&s;e inau&s;picious &s;ymptoms in the &s;ame melancholy light, and drew the mo&s;t de&s;ponding conclu&s;ions from them. One evening, when they were in anxi|ous expectation of Mr. G&mdash;, Henry, per|ceiving that his mother would be glad to di&s;|pen&s;e with Zachary's attendance, drew him a&s;ide, and, walking down to the beach, began to que&s;tion him about his patient, expre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="271" REF="279">
him&s;elf as without hope of her recovery, and under momentary terrors of her immediate di&s;&s;olution. To this Zachary replied, that although be &s;aw that &s;ad event in approach, and, in his own judgment, regarded it as in|evitable, yet he conjectured that &s;he would have a gradual and lingering di&s;mi&s;&s;ion out of life, without pain or lo&s;s of &s;en&s;es; and that no rapid, or immediate, di&s;&s;olution was to be ap|prehended. <Q REND="inline">"I hope therefore,"</Q> added he, <Q REND="inline">"our dear lady will yet find time and capacity to &s;ettle her affairs to your &s;atisfaction and ad|vantage, and put you in a &s;ituation to propo&s;e for the lovelie&s;t girl in England, to whom, I perceive, you are very &s;eriou&s;ly attach'd."</Q> No an&s;wer being returned to this, he proceed|ed&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"For my own part, I am per&s;uaded there is no love lo&s;t between you, as the &s;aying is; and if you have left your heart with Mi&s;s Man&s;tock in pledge, you have taken her's away with you in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; for I am no in|different phy&s;iognomi&s;t, and not apt to be out in my conjectures as to the human heart. I had a little private talk with the young lady during our halt at Man&s;tock Hou&s;e; and, I believe, my friend, I did your cau&s;e no harm by what I &s;aid on that occa&s;ion."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"The le&s;s
<PB N="272" REF="280">
you &s;aid, the better,"</Q> Henry coldly replied.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Come, come, young gentleman,"</Q> re|&s;umed Zachary, <Q REND="inline">"you are too mode&s;t, too diffident; it is not the fir&s;t time you have &s;tood in your own light with the ladies: And that puts me in mind of my poor boozy dame, who has now, I &s;uppo&s;e, drank up her drink, and &s;leeps in peace. Alexander Kinloch writes me word, and I have this morning receiv'd his letter, that &s;he is ab&s;olutely at death's door. Well! God's will be done; I mu&s;t bear it with chri&s;tian patience; <HI>Mors omnibus commu|nis.</HI>"</Q>&mdash;Here the Doctor took out his hand|kerchief, and, in conformity to cu&s;tom upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, applied it to his eyes; where, if there had been a tear, no doubt the afore|&s;aid handkerchief would have done its duty, and di&s;po&s;ed of it. <Q REND="inline">"But I mu&s;t prepare my&s;elf to expect the wor&s;t,"</Q> added he; <Q REND="inline">"for if death be at the door, and none but Sawney Kinloch to keep him out, why 'tis natural to conclude, that all is over with my poor dame. To be &s;ure &s;he had her failings, as who has not? but cu&s;tom familiariz'd me to them. She certainly made &s;ome trips in point of fidelity to my bed, but then &s;he was over-partial to the brandy-bottle, and that accounts for her
<PB N="273" REF="281">
incontinence, you know, very naturally. She was a little over-righteous, it mu&s;t be own'd, and &s;addled me with the &s;aints rather more than was agreeable; but then her religion was mere hypocri&s;y, &s;o that I cou'd not quarrel with her on that account. She was &s;ome|thing of a termagant, I cannot deny; told a pretty many untruths, and bred a pretty many di&s;turbances in my family; but then &s;he did the &s;ame by all her neighbours as by me, &s;o that I had no cau&s;e in particular to complain of her; and, upon the whole, have as much rea&s;on to regret the lo&s;s of my wife, as mo&s;t hu&s;bands have to lament for their's."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, my good ma&s;ter,"</Q> &s;aid Henry &s;mil|ing, <Q REND="inline">"notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e good qualities which you have counted up, I am in hopes you'll hear your lo&s;s with tolerable compo&s;ure, and that your days to come will not pa&s;s the le&s;s to your content becau&s;e you have no longer a wife in exi&s;tence, who an&s;wers to the de&s;crip|tion you have been giving: At lea&s;t I hope life may be tolerable, tho' you have neither &s;ot, &s;lut, nor &s;hrew in your hou&s;e, to enter|tain you: and as the time, I fear, is not far off, when you will have a real friend to la|ment, I fore&s;ee that your profe&s;&s;ional cares
<PB N="274" REF="282">
will not long &s;urvive your dome&s;tic ones, and in that ca&s;e you will have to look out for a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or in your bu&s;ine&s;s. Shou'd that be the ca&s;e, and &s;hou'd Alexander Kinloch not be the man that an&s;wers to your wi&s;hes, I beg you will let me recommend to you a friend of mine, for who&s;e &s;ufficiency, in all re&s;pects, I will make my&s;elf re&s;pon&s;ible: the per&s;on I &s;peak of is your quondam a&s;&s;i&s;tant, Mr. William Williams, at pre&s;ent Surgeon of Captain Carey's frigate, a man very highly to be e&s;teem'd for his private character, and of who&s;e abilities, in every branch of his profe&s;&s;ion, I am bold to promi&s;e, you may be furni&s;h'd with the &s;tronge&s;t te&s;timonials."</Q>&mdash;To this Zachary re|plied, that he had a very high opinion of Wil|liams, and without he&s;itation &s;hould prefer him to every other proponent, not only in re&s;pect to Henry's good wi&s;hes for him, but on the &s;core of his own merit: as for the old Scotch|man, he prote&s;ted again&s;t him in any other capacity than as a cheap drudge at the mortar, if Williams cho&s;e to continue him there, which however he &s;hould not be very forward to ad|vi&s;e.</P>
<P>This matter being adju&s;ted to Henry's &s;a|tisfaction, he now perceived a chai&s;e and four
<PB N="275" REF="283">
&s;top at Lady Crowbery's door; and running to it, had the gratification of finding that Mr. G&mdash; him&s;elf had complied with that Lady's reque&s;t, and come down in per&s;on. A &s;hort conver&s;ation with that excellent man &s;oon opened to him a character, in which integrity is &s;o prominent, that nature, in the formation of it, &s;eemed determined &s;o to place her work as that no one &s;hould overlook or mi&s;take it. It will &s;uffice therefore to &s;ay, that every thing was done, acording to the will of the te&s;tatrix, which method in bu&s;ine&s;s and correctne&s;s in form could effect: the &s;ame opportunity al&s;o &s;erved for Mr. Delapoer to make his promi&s;ed &s;ettlement on his &s;on our hero; and this being done, our hone&s;t lawyer (and as &s;uch we ven|ture to pronounce him one of the worthie&s;t members of the community) returned to his &s;tation in life; where we hope he will long abide, to protect the property of his clients, and enliven the &s;ociety of his friends.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VIII. A gentle Being drops into the Grave.</HEAD>
<P>A Few days had pa&s;&s;ed after the departure of Mr. G&mdash;, when the Lady Crow|bery, perceiving her &s;mall remains of &s;trength hourly on the decline, communicated to her friends her total abandonment of all hope of &s;tirring from the &s;pot &s;he was in; at the &s;ame time expre&s;&s;ing her acquie&s;cence in the call of Providence, and the thankfulne&s;s with which &s;he &s;hould obey the &s;ummons, in the pre&s;ence of tho&s;e who were deare&s;t to her in this world. She &s;till found &s;trength, by intervals, to write a farewell letter to her unworthy Lord, al&s;o one of a very affectionate ca&s;t to her uncle Man&s;tock, both which &s;he committed to the po&s;t: to I&s;abella &s;he likewi&s;e wrote, on a &s;ub|ject more important to her than that of taking leave for life, as it re&s;pected the future happi|ne&s;s of her beloved &s;on, and explained (in terms, however, the mo&s;t delicate) her im|plied hopes and views in the di&s;po&s;ition &s;he had made of her e&s;tate; and this letter &s;he put
<PB N="277" REF="285">
into Henry's hands, referring it to his di&s;cre|tion in what manner, and at what period, to make u&s;e of it.</P>
<P>To Zachary Cawdle &s;he bequeathed an an|nuity of three hundred pounds a year, charge|able upon her e&s;tate, to be paid quarterly and punctually. In &s;mall legacies to &s;ervants, and charitable donations, a further &s;um was in|volved, for which due provi&s;ion was made, and direction given. Of Henry no mention was to be found in her will; but both to him and his father &s;he gave, with her own hands, &s;everal little articles, valuable only as tokens of affection and pledges of remembrance. Every thing that per&s;onally belonged to her in Crowbery Ca&s;tle, of which &s;he had many particulars, were left to the Lord of that man|&s;ion; the re&s;idue was bequeathed in tru&s;t to Sir Roger Man&s;tock, for the u&s;e and benefit of I&s;abella, without entail, and at her free di&s;|po&s;al, when &s;he &s;hould attain the age of eigh|teen years, of which there yet remained &s;ome months only before her non-age &s;hould ex|pire.</P>
<P>Neither her &s;en&s;es nor &s;pirits &s;eemed to yield at the approach of death; every morn|ing &s;he was conveyed from her bed to a couch
<PB N="278" REF="286">
in her &s;itting-room, which had a plea&s;ant view of the &s;ea and &s;hore. Here &s;he was con&s;tantly attended by one or both of her beloved friends, who&s;e tender a&s;&s;iduities cheared her to her late&s;t moments; &s;he took particular delight in li&s;tening to Delapoer's narrative of his adven|tures in India, which he contrived to render both intere&s;ting and entertaining to her, in|troducing it at &s;uch times only as &s;he &s;eemed to call for it, and in &s;uch proportions as might not weary her attention, or too forcibly agi|tate her feelings.&mdash;She al&s;o, in her turn, had a &s;tory to relate, which, though told with great mitigation towards Lord Crowbery, and with the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of many cruel circum|&s;tances in his conduct, and &s;ufferings on her part, was not always heard with the temper and patience that &s;he wi&s;hed to in&s;pire. De|lapoer, in &s;pite of all his caution, would &s;ome|times give way to the warmth of his natural character, and once or twice, to her &s;en&s;ible regret, broke forth into menaces and denun|ciations. The&s;e &s;he would, with anxious &s;o|licitude, &s;trive to qualify and repre&s;s. <Q REND="inline">"If you love me, Delapoer,"</Q> &s;he would &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"you will remember my words after death, and not di&s;grace my memory, or di&s;turb my &s;pirit in
<PB N="279" REF="287">
the grave, by a revengeful and violent pro|ceeding towards Lord Crowbery. Had he been indulgent and kind to me, how &s;everely would my con&s;cience have reproach'd me; and if, on the contrary, he has been &s;ome|what har&s;h and ungentle, cannot you recollect enough, both committed and omitted on my part, to extenuate, if not to warrant, his un|kindne&s;s? You'll &s;ay my marriage was a compul&s;ory one&mdash;'tis true it was &s;o; but &s;till I was a party, tho' a mo&s;t unwilling one, in the impo&s;ition that was put upon him: in my heart he never cou'd obtain a place; I paid him obedience&mdash;I had no more to be&s;tow."</Q></P>
<P>The la&s;t conver&s;ation of this &s;ort &s;he had with Delapoer was on the evening preceding the day on which &s;he died: &s;he was fervent in prayer that her errors might be pardoned, and, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, conjured him to con&s;pire with her in atonement, by giving double diligence to the performance of tho&s;e duties which their joint offence had entailed upon them in the per&s;on of their &s;on. Whil&s;t &s;he was thus addre&s;&s;ing him, Delapoer, who was &s;upporting her as &s;he &s;ate erect on the couch, perceived a convul&s;ive &s;ymptom in the mu&s;cles about her mouth, which gave him in|&s;tant alarm: and the eager look with which
<PB N="280" REF="288">
he pur&s;ued his ob&s;ervation, convinced her that &s;ome change had happened in her features to occa&s;ion it.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Ah! my dear friend,"</Q> &s;he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I under&s;tand your looks, I am dying; per|haps I am disfigur'd; if &s;o, leave me, I im|plore you; do not let the la&s;t impre&s;&s;ion of this face, which you once beheld with plea&s;ure, remain upon your memory with di&s;gu&s;t and horror. If I am fit to be &s;een, let me thus expire, &s;upported in your arms; if not, fare|well for ever; let my &s;ervants be call'd, and let me not &s;hock either you or my &s;on with an object &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ing."</Q> As &s;he faintly ut|tered the&s;e words, &s;he put her hands before her face, which Delapoer gently cla&s;ped in his, a&s;&s;uring her, that her &s;u&s;picion was unfound|ed, and that her features indicated no &s;uch &s;ymptoms as &s;he apprehended. He &s;oon after rung the bell, when Henry entered ha&s;tily, fol|lowed by Zachary and two female attendants: Henry threw him&s;elf on his knees by the &s;ide of her couch, and continued for &s;ome minutes enfolded in her arms, in &s;peechle&s;s agony; for he al&s;o perceived the change, and &s;aw the hand of death was upon her. A convul&s;ive tremor now &s;eized her whole frame, and &s;he &s;unk down on her couch in&s;en&s;ible, while the Doc|tor
<PB N="281" REF="289">
exhorted them to leave her to the care of him&s;elf and the women. Through the re|mainder of the night &s;he do&s;ed with &s;hort in|tervals, in which &s;he appeared to have &s;ome degree of recollection, but never uttered a word or &s;eemed to experience a pain; at an early hour of the morning, &s;he drew her la&s;t &s;igh and expired. The father and the &s;on were &s;tanding by the &s;ide of the bed at that awful moment, and the &s;mile, which love impre&s;&s;ed upon her features, as her eyes caught a part|ing &s;ight of them, before they clo&s;ed for ever, remained after death, as if to tell the be|holders that her &s;oul, unwilling to derange the beautiful frame in which it had been en|ca&s;ed, had left its peace behind it, whil&s;t it conveyed it&s;elf away to the man&s;ions of im|mortality and bli&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IX. Our Hi&s;tory pre&s;ents a Scene, not very flattering to Human Nature.</HEAD>
<P>WE have now clo&s;ed the hi&s;tory of the amiable but unhappy Lady Crowbery, and we would fain hope that &s;uch of our rea|ders
<PB N="282" REF="290">
as are parents, will think the moral of her fate not unworthy of their con&s;ideration and reflection.</P>
<P>One of the fir&s;t duties that devolved upon her afflicted friends, was to give information of the mournful event to her ab&s;ent connec|tions. This bu&s;ine&s;s was undertaken by Doc|tor Zachary, who immediately penned a re|&s;pectful epi&s;tle to Sir Roger Man&s;tock; and al&s;o one in like terms to the Lord Vi&s;count Crowbery, which were &s;ent off by expre&s;s.</P>
<P>Delapoer and his &s;on determined upon &s;tay|ing by the remains of their lamented friend, till orders &s;hould be received from Lord Crow|bery re&s;pecting the funeral; and Henry took an early opportunity of making his friend Cap|tain Carey acquainted with the &s;ad event, that had now occa&s;ioned him to decline all thoughts of rejoining the victorious frigate. The re|turn of the po&s;t brought him the following an&s;wer from that gallant officer:&mdash;

<P>I loved and re&s;pected my relation Lady Crowbery, as much as I de&s;pi&s;e and abhor the wretch, who not only &s;hortened but em|bittered her days; and I lament her &s;ad fate

</LETTER>
The me&s;&s;enger in the mean time, who was charged with the mournful tidings of his lady's death, proceeded on his way with all po&s;&s;ible expedition; and according to his in&s;tructions, fir&s;t pre&s;ented him&s;elf at the ca&s;tle of his Lord, and delivered his di&s;patch. It was received and read in the company of the Reverend Mr. Claypole and Mi&s;s Fanny; the former of whom had deported him&s;elf with all po&s;&s;ible addre&s;s, and enjoyed the &s;atisfaction of con|templating the flattering pro&s;pect, that every hour brought nearer to his view, from the encrea&s;ing attachment of that noble per&s;onage to his amiable niece. An uncle, more &s;en|&s;itive to appearances, or le&s;s per&s;uaded of the purity of the female character, might have proved a trouble&s;ome gue&s;t to a nobleman of his Lord&s;hip's irritable feelings at certain
<PB N="284" REF="292">
moments, when the vehemence of his pa&s;&s;ion carried him beyond the bounds, which &s;ome people of more rigid notions would have thought a little on the out&s;ide of di&s;cretion; but Mr. Claypole was not one of the&s;e for|mal di&s;ciplinarians, and accommodated him|&s;elf to times and &s;ea&s;ons with admirable faci|lity. With a &s;oul &s;uperior to &s;u&s;picion, he heeded not tho&s;e innocent dalliances that pa&s;&s;ed between the lovers, whil&s;t he had the re&s;ource of a book, or a walk, and &s;ometimes of a nap in his chair, to fill up an hour when conver&s;ation was &s;u&s;pended, and dumb-&s;hew took place of dialogue.</P>
<P>Captain Crowbery was upon a vi&s;it to a friend in a di&s;tant country, &s;o that the &s;ociety of the ca&s;tle was very much confined, and their harmony &s;eldom if ever interrupted by the intru&s;ion of unwelcome vi&s;itors. Mi&s;s Fanny po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the apartment of the ab&s;ent lady, and had already made &s;ome arrange|ments in the di&s;po&s;ition and furniture of it, which &s;he a&s;&s;erted, and my Lord acknow|ledged, to be very &s;triking improvements. Two or three old dome&s;tics, who had con&s;i|dered them&s;elves as appertaining to the lady of the hou&s;e, were now very naturally regarded
<PB N="285" REF="293">
as &s;upernumeraries; and upon a principle of oeconomy, which the Reverend Mr. Claypole took all proper occa&s;ions to inculcate, were paid off and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. One or two of the&s;e, who had belonged to Lady Crowbery's family from their youth, and were pa&s;t the age of &s;ervice, were entertained by Sir Roger Man|&s;tock, and charitably enrolled among&s;t his band of pen&s;ioners; the others &s;ought their livelihood where they could find it. By an arrangement with the par&s;on of Crowbery, the Reverend Mr. Claypole took the duty of that pari&s;h upon him&s;elf, and transferred to him the &s;ervice of the church at Man&s;tock; to which Sir Roger very willingly accorded, from motives, that in candour we mu&s;t ac|knowledge to have had &s;ome re&s;pect to his own ea&s;e and convenience, as well as to the afore&s;aid Mr. Claypole's. No intercour&s;e whatever had in the mean time pa&s;&s;ed be|tween the allied hou&s;es of Crowbery and Man|&s;tock; few &s;ouls were le&s;s akin than tho&s;e of their owners and their re&s;pective a&s;&s;ociates.</P>
<P>No charge could be laid again&s;t Mother Nature, for having mi&s;applied her workman|&s;hip upon the mould in which &s;he had ca&s;t the per&s;on of Lord Crowbery; nay, on the
<PB N="286" REF="294">
contrary, it &s;hould &s;eem &s;he had both tem|pered and modelled it with the mo&s;t accurate attention, and harmonized it to the &s;oul which it enveloped with the nice&s;t art. No man of common ob&s;ervation could receive a fal&s;e im|pre&s;&s;ion of his Lord&s;hip's character from the fir&s;t glance of his exterior. Nature had not given to him the outward &s;emblance of any one virtue, dignity or endowment, which he did not mentally po&s;&s;e&s;s; neither was there one moral failing or defect to be found in the journal of his life, which might not figurative|ly be &s;aid to &s;tand recorded in the title-page of that hi&s;tory: In &s;hort, if he had had hy|pocri&s;y enough to affect the manners of a gentleman, nobody but a fool would have been capable of being duped by him.</P>
<P>This accompli&s;hed Peer, though not quite fitted in all particulars to fill up the vacancy which Henry had left in the &s;oft heart of Mi&s;s Fanny, neverthele&s;s was encouraged by that young lady to believe that he was in ab&s;olute po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. To develope her motives for deceiving him into this opinion might be an unplea&s;ant inve&s;tigation; but when we have &s;aid that ambition and revenge were of the party, it is not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;earch for others
<PB N="287" REF="295">
to make up the number. This young lady and his Lord&s;hip were ju&s;t then engaged in conver&s;ation on a very intere&s;ting topic, whil&s;t the Reverend Mr. Claypole had dropt a&s;leep on a &s;opha that filled up a rece&s;s in the room; when the &s;ervant arrived from Falmouth with the letter, which announced the death of Lady Crowbery. His Lord&s;hip read it with a coun|tenance, that did not indicate any of tho&s;e weakne&s;&s;es, which human nature &s;ometimes is betrayed into upon a &s;udden &s;urprize. He peru&s;ed it with a &s;teady eye, folded it up again with a firm hand, and putting it into his pocket, in a tone of voice which abated nothing of its u&s;ual energy, coolly ob&s;erved, that the expected event was come to pa&s;s&mdash;Lady Crow|bery was dead.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Fanny &s;tarted from her &s;eat, with an exclamation very frequently applied by ladies of her fa&s;hion, to expre&s;s either joy, &s;orrow, &s;urprize or any other pa&s;&s;ion, that attacks their gentle &s;pirits unawares. At the &s;ame in&s;tant the reverend &s;leeper &s;prung from his couch, ready prepared to &s;econd any emotion that his noble friend might be plea&s;ed to expre&s;s, either of joy or &s;orrow: his noble friend did not as yet di&s;cover to which party he was di&s;|po&s;ed
<PB N="288" REF="296">
to incline, therefore Mr. Claypole ju|diciou&s;ly kept &s;ilence, and held his faculties &s;u&s;pended in a neutral &s;tate, till circum&s;tances &s;hould determine them. <Q REND="inline">"I gue&s;s'd how this &s;cheme to Li&s;bon wou'd end,"</Q> cried the Peer.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Yes,"</Q> replied the Par&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;u&s;pected it wou'd terminate as it has done, when that booby of an apothecary took upon him the charge of her lady&s;hip's con&s;titution."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"A pretty fellow truly,"</Q> re&s;umed my Lord, <Q REND="inline">"to be travelling phy&s;ician to a woman of quality! but I can under&s;tand nothing from his letter, but that his patient has &s;lipp'd through his hands; therefore, with your leave, I &s;hall &s;tep into my library, and try what information may be gather'd from the me&s;&s;enger."</Q>&mdash;This &s;aid, he ro&s;e from his chair, and calmly &s;talked out of the room.</P>
<P>The uncle and niece were now &s;et free from all re&s;traint, and &s;oon began to let loo&s;e their &s;entiments upon this intere&s;ting event, with|out re&s;erve:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I judg'd her ca&s;e to be de&s;pe|rate,"</Q> cried the uncle; <Q REND="inline">"&s;he was a lo&s;t wo|man when I &s;aw her at Man&s;tock. I cannot &s;ay &s;he gave me any great rea&s;on to lament her lo&s;s: if I ever had any obligations to her, &s;he cancel'd them all by her la&s;t haughty
<PB N="289" REF="297">
treatment of me, when I mode&s;tly made &s;uit for the poor favour of &s;ucceeding Par&s;on Rat|cliffe."</Q> To this the niece made no an&s;wer, nor indeed had &s;he paid any attention, as her mind was ju&s;t then engaged in computing the period of a widower's fir&s;t mourning; and as this meditation involved her in &s;ome di|lemma, &s;he abruptly appealed to her uncle, whether it was totally out of form for his Lord&s;hip to be married, before he was out of weepers and black gloves: <Q REND="inline">"That is as it may be,"</Q> replied the uncle, <Q REND="inline">"&s;ome people judge in tho&s;e matters with more liberality and latitude than others; I am no great critic in forms, but this I know, that the &s;ooner you bring his Lord&s;hip to the point, my dear Fanny, the better;"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Why that is done al|ready,"</Q> cried the Lady elect, <Q REND="inline">"the point is carried, and I have his honour in pledge; el&s;e can you &s;uppo&s;e I wou'd admit?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Cer|tainly not,"</Q> cried Claypole, interrupting her; <Q REND="inline">"I cannot doubt but you know the ground you are upon, and therefore it is that I have never interpos'd my advice; but now that there is no longer any ob&s;tacle, I &s;hou'd re|commend you to hold back, till he fulfils his engagements: a &s;ea&s;onable re&s;erve may

quicken de&s;ire, too much kindne&s;s may chance to quell it."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I believe,"</Q> cried the niece, <Q REND="inline">"I am fully capable of conducting my&s;elf in this affair, without re&s;orting to an advi&s;er; where there is no pa&s;&s;ion at the heart, it is not likely there &s;hou'd be any error in the judg|ment, and I flatter my&s;elf you do me ju&s;tice to believe, I am not in love with the per&s;on of Lord Crowbery: he is not a Henry to catch the eye or engage the heart, but he is a Peer of England, has a good e&s;tate and a noble ca&s;tle, which, when I am the mi&s;tre&s;s of, I confe&s;s the triumph it will give me over that provoking chit I&s;abella, whom I hate and de|te&s;t at my heart, will not be among&s;t the lea&s;t of my enjoyments."</Q></P>
<P>Lord Crowbery, in the meantime, having a&s;ked a few trifling que&s;tions of the bearer of the letter, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him, and &s;ent for his agent lawyer Ferret, to whom he dictated the fol|lowing lines, by way of an&s;wer to the que&s;|tions referred to him in Zachary's di&s;patch:</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER X. The Scene is &s;hifted to Man&s;tock Hou&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the me&s;&s;enger arrived at Man|&s;tock Hou&s;e, Sir Roger was ju&s;t re|turned home from the county town, where he had been unanimou&s;ly elected repre&s;entative in parliament. The mournful news cau&s;ed deep affliction both to him and the &s;en&s;itive I&s;abella; the &s;ame &s;ervant was charged with a verbal me&s;&s;age from Lord Crowbery, &s;ig|nifying
<PB N="292" REF="300">
that he declined interfering with any wi&s;hes Sir Roger might have, re&s;pecting the place of burial and the di&s;po&s;al of the remains; he added, that when the will was opened he pre&s;umed he &s;hould have notice. Sir Roger well under&s;tood the &s;pirit of this me&s;&s;age, and properly felt both the in&s;ult and the meanne&s;s it implied. The in&s;tant he could compo&s;e his thoughts &s;ufficiently for the pur|po&s;e, he wrote to Zachary Cawdle, requiring him to tran&s;mit the body with all proper de|corum and attendance, fitting the quality of the decea&s;ed, by ea&s;y &s;tages to the family vault of her ance&s;tors, at her paternal &s;eat of Hagley Hall, where him&s;elf and his daughter purpo&s;ed to be in waiting to receive it, and to pay the la&s;t honours to the corp&s;e of his mo&s;t dear and lamented niece. The bu&s;ine&s;s this involved him in, had probably the effect of occupying &s;o much of his time and thoughts, that grief had the le&s;s opportunity of fixing upon him; but the tender I&s;abella, who had not &s;o full a &s;hare of tho&s;e avocations, &s;urren|dered her&s;elf to melancholy and de&s;ponding meditations. In her brea&s;t al&s;o there was lodged a &s;ecret of mo&s;t &s;erious import; and in the mean time &s;he had no in&s;tructions how
<PB N="293" REF="301">
to di&s;po&s;e of it; the&s;e &s;he expected to receive by &s;ome hand or other, but what to wi&s;h &s;he knew not; whether they &s;hould be to impart it to her father, or &s;till to conceal it from him, was an alternative that offered nothing to her reflection, but difficulties and di&s;tre&s;&s;es on both &s;ides: that Henry &s;hould be left heir to his mother's e&s;tate, was naturally to be expected, but how he could be named or de&s;cribed in her will, without a di&s;covery of his birth, was what &s;he could not comprehend: the papers that had been written for her father's in&s;pec|tion after her cou&s;in's death, &s;he knew had been de&s;troyed, and that purpo&s;e revoked: &s;he apprehended, therefore, that &s;ome order would come to her for divulging it to Sir Roger; and this was a ta&s;k which of all earthly undertakings was mo&s;t dreadful to her: In the meantime the preparations were put forward for the journey, and &s;ervants were di&s;patched beforehand to get the hou&s;e in order to receive them, and to &s;et on foot all the preliminary ceremonials for a re&s;pectable and &s;plendid funeral.</P>
<P>In this interval arrived Mr. G&mdash; with the will, and his coming was mo&s;t &s;ea&s;onable, for it was on the very eve of Sir Roger's &s;et|ting
<PB N="294" REF="302">
out on his journey. This event was im|mediately communicated to Lord Crowbery, and with the me&s;&s;enger, who carried Sir Roger's note to his Lord&s;hip, returned not the principal him&s;elf, but his repre&s;entative Mr. John Jeffery Ferret, attorney at law and agent to the noble Peer afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>The arrival of this augu&s;t per&s;onage being announced, the Baronet with his fair daughter, and the re&s;pectable holder and maker of the will, a&s;&s;embled in the book-room, and were &s;oon honoured with the pre&s;ence of Mr. Ferret, before whom the &s;eals, after being &s;ubmitted to his in&s;pection, were &s;olemnly broken open, and the will di&s;tinctly and audi|bly read by Mr. G&mdash;. The &s;ignatures, &s;eals, dates, and every other particular, were minutely examined by the &s;aid Mr. Ferret, who was a&s;ked by Mr. G&mdash; if he was &s;atis|fied as to what he had &s;een and heard; to which, after due time for recollection, he gravely replied, <Q REND="inline">"In point of form I &s;ee no|thing at pre&s;ent to object to, in point of e&s;&s;ence I &s;hall decline giving any an&s;wer till I have advi&s;ed with coun&s;el.

her decea&s;e, it will be requi&s;ite to a&s;certain, that the te&s;tatrix was actually and bon&acirc; fide of &s;ound mind and judgment at the time of her &s;igning the &s;aid will; under&s;tand me not, I pray you, as in&s;inuating any thing to the con|trary, but being a profe&s;&s;ional man your&s;elf, you will admit the rea&s;onablene&s;s of what I &s;ay, which is no more than my duty to my principal requires of me;"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I believe your principal,"</Q> replied Mr. G&mdash;, <Q REND="inline">"received a letter from the te&s;tatrix, written throughout with her own hand, &s;ince the date of this will, which if he is not di&s;po&s;ed to refer to, Sir Roger Man&s;tock, I am per&s;uaded, has one of as late a date to produce, which will te&s;tify to her capacity, together with other proofs, which will be forth-coming whenever you are in|&s;tructed to call for them: in &s;hort, Sir, we &s;hall be ready to meet you in any way you &s;hall think fit to require of us."</Q></P>
<P>During this conver&s;ation Sir Roger &s;ate in &s;ilent a&s;toni&s;hment to find the purport of the will &s;o contrary to his expectations, ina&s;much as the name or de&s;cription of Henry was no where mentioned, nor any beque&s;t whatever &s;pecified, that could by any implication refer to him, whil&s;t the agitation it occa&s;ioned in
<PB N="296" REF="304">
the bo&s;om of I&s;abella was &s;uch, that unable to keep her &s;eat, &s;he ro&s;e and demanded of Mr. G&mdash; if &s;he might not be permitted to leave the room, which being an&s;wered in the affirmative, &s;he lo&s;t no time to avail her&s;elf of, and ha&s;tened away. <Q REND="inline">"I perceive,"</Q> &s;aid lawyer Ferret, <Q REND="inline">"that my Lord Crowbery has no further intere&s;t in this will, than what re|&s;pects a few per&s;onals appertaining to the de|ceas'd, left behind her in the ca&s;tle, of which perhaps a query might be made as to her Lady&s;hip's right of di&s;po&s;al:"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"That's a query,"</Q> cried M. G&mdash;, <Q REND="inline">"we have no con|cern with; it can only affect your&s;elves, there|fore you'll manage it in your own way."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I perceive al&s;o,"</Q> re&s;umed Ferret with &s;ome &s;urprize, <Q REND="inline">"here is no mention made of a cer|tain young man, whom we in the&s;e parts ex|pected to find remembered by her Lady&s;hip at her death, having &s;een him &s;o much fa|vour'd by her in her life time."</Q> Upon this Sir Roger ro&s;e from his &s;eat, and addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Mr. G&mdash; &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I humbly con|ceive, Sir, if this gentleman has no legal ob|&s;ervations to &s;tate, we are not bound to li&s;ten to any others, and may break up the meet|ing."</Q> Mr. G&mdash; having made &s;ign of a&s;|&s;ent,
<PB N="297" REF="305">
the Baronet departed without further ce|remony, and lawyer Ferret having put in his claim for a copy of the will, called for his hor&s;e and &s;et forward on the &s;pur, to report his proceedings at the place from whence he came.</P>
<P>This bu&s;ine&s;s being ended, Mr. G&mdash; joined the Baronet and the heire&s;s, who were expecting him in the adjoining room. Sir Roger began the conver&s;ation, by expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf very greatly &s;urprized at the purport of his niece's beque&s;t of her entire e&s;tate to his daughter: <Q REND="inline">"Nay, I mu&s;t fairly declare to you,"</Q> added he, <Q REND="inline">"that I am at a lo&s;s how to reconcile my&s;elf to the ju&s;tice of it. The re|mark which that impertinent attorney made, upon the total &s;ilence ob&s;erved towards a cer|tain young man, who to my knowledge was encourag'd to expect a provi&s;ion, was a very natural one in it&s;elf, though out of place in his mouth: and to &s;ay the truth, Sir, I can|not for the life of me comprehend how &s;uch an omi&s;&s;ion cou'd take place, after the promi&s;es and a&s;&s;urances I my&s;elf have been a witne&s;s to. May I a&s;k you to explain this, and how it came to pa&s;s that either he forfeited her fa|vour, or that &s;he forgot to make good her
<PB N="298" REF="306">
promi&s;e?"</Q> To this Mr. G&mdash; replied, that he could only an&s;wer that enquiry in part, by a&s;&s;uring him that the young gentleman in que&s;tion, had in no degree forfeited the favour and good opinion of the lady decea&s;ed.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Then I am more than ever puzzled to find a cau&s;e of her neglect of him,"</Q> &s;aid the Baro|net: <Q REND="inline">"Permit me to a&s;k you if he &s;aw my niece before her death:</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"He was with her Lady&s;hip, as I believe, to the very hour of her death."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"And was he privy to the will;"</Q> demanded Sir Roger? <Q REND="inline">"I doubt,"</Q> &s;aid the worthy re&s;pondent, <Q REND="inline">"if I ought in &s;trictne&s;s to an&s;wer that que&s;tion, but in con|fidence I will venture to di&s;clo&s;e to you and this lady pre&s;ent, that he was not only per|fectly made acquainted with the di&s;po&s;ition of Lady Crowbery's property, but al&s;o a very active party in the promotion of that mea|&s;ure:"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Then upon my life,"</Q> exclaimed Sir Roger, <Q REND="inline">"that &s;ame my&s;terious unknown is without exception the mo&s;t extraordinary and unaccountable young man now living: this is the &s;econd time he has put fortune from him, and voluntarily preferred poverty to af|fluence."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I prote&s;t I do not &s;ee any my&s;|tery
<PB N="299" REF="307">
in that,"</Q> &s;aid the other, <Q REND="inline">"I clearly un|der&s;tand there are certain &s;en&s;ations he prefers to others, and certain things in this world which he loves better than his intere&s;t."</Q></P>
<P>At this moment Mr. G&mdash;, in taking his &s;nuff-box from his pocket, dropped his glove upon the floor without perceiving it, which the lovely I&s;abella immediately picked up and pre&s;ented to him with a grace peculiar to her&s;elf. An attention &s;o flattering, naturally drew a return of excu&s;es and apologies from Mr. G&mdash; for his inattention in &s;uffering her to conde&s;cend to &s;uch an office; to which &s;he replied, whil&s;t blu&s;hes over&s;pread her cheeks, and gratitude gli&s;tened in her eyes;&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Any thing I can do to &s;hew my re&s;pect for Mr. G&mdash;, will be an office I &s;hall be proud of."</Q> This was pointed in &s;o marked a man|ner, and introduced with a look &s;o expre&s;&s;ive, that it would have been impo&s;&s;ible for any common ob&s;erver, much le&s;s for that intelli|gent per&s;on him&s;elf, not to comprehend the motive of it; and though Sir Roger gave no &s;ign of his having regarded it other|wi&s;e than as an ordinary act of politene&s;s, yet we may ri&s;que a conjecture, that he argued from it in his own thoughts pretty much in
<PB N="300" REF="308">
the &s;ame way with the gentleman to whom it was addre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>This little incident did not, however, alto|gether turn their di&s;cour&s;e from the topic they were upon: I&s;abella ventured to enquire of Mr. G&mdash; if Henry was recovered from his wound, which que&s;tion, he conceiving it to allude to the action on board the frigate, drew him into a de&s;cription of that fight, as he had heard it from Mr. Delapoer. This was in it&s;elf an intere&s;ting narrative, though not altogether new to the hearers of it, for Cary had written to his uncle &s;ince he came into port, and done ju&s;tice to his brave volunteer; but the warmth of his heart, who had it now in narration, and the affection he had con|ceived for our amiable hero through the na|tural &s;ympathy of congenial &s;ouls, gave a brighter hue to the de&s;cription, and animated one at lea&s;t of his audience in &s;o peculiar a manner, that, at the conclu&s;ion of it, &s;he was impelled to venture upon an inference, which in a more collected moment &s;he would hardly have ri&s;qued, viz. <Q REND="inline">"That where &s;o much courage and benevolence were united, it was no wonder if every action of &s;uch a character,
<PB N="301" REF="309">
produced &s;omething uncommonly noble and &s;uperior to views of worldly minds."</Q></P>
<P>An apo&s;trophe, &s;o much above the pitch of I&s;abella's natural diffidence, would hardly have pa&s;&s;ed without a comment from Sir Roger, had not Mr. G&mdash; been pre&s;ent, or, let us rather &s;ay, had it not been ju&s;tly due to the merits of our hero.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"WHAT imprudence have I given way to,"</Q> &s;aid I&s;abella within her&s;elf, when &s;he retired to her &s;olitary meditations in her own apartment; <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall certainly receive the rebuke which I have merited from my father: but Oh! that I might be &s;uffer'd to give vent to my re&s;pect and gratitude for that charming man who &s;poke &s;o warmly of my Henry; yes, yes, he is all that's good and generous, all that is brave and benevolent, all that is engaging, amiable, and excellent in human nature: and now I can interpret his proceeding, I can &s;olve his motives for the &s;acrifice he has made of his inheritance, to pre&s;erve the memory of his mo|ther

from di&s;grace and &s;hame: glorious, une|qualled genero&s;ity, which throws him on my honour for re&s;titution; and, thank Heaven, that honour glows within my brea&s;t as warmly as within his own.

Have I not heard him tenderly expre&s;s his feelings, his affections, and what an&s;wer did I make?

My &s;ighs were vows, my parting tears were &s;eals of love, more &s;acred, more &s;incere, than all the bonds that law or language can devi&s;e; and I will keep them faithfully in remembrance; yes, Henry, whil&s;t I have life my heart can never change; I may be wretched, fal&s;e I will not be."</Q></P>
<P>Here Sir Roger entered the room; his plea was to enquire if &s;he was preparing for her journey on the next morning; but he &s;ate down, and entered into a di&s;cour&s;e that cer|tainly
<PB N="303" REF="311">
was not calculated to forward tho&s;e pre|parations: he began by ob&s;erving to her how much he had been &s;urpri&s;ed at the reading of his niece's will; and a&s;ked her, with a &s;mile, how &s;he felt her&s;elf affected by the &s;udden ac|ce&s;&s;ion of &s;o great a fortune; <Q REND="inline">"I fancy,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"you did not expect, when we propo&s;ed this mournful journey, that you was going to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your own e&s;tate; I can a&s;|&s;ure you, I&s;abella, it is a very fine place, and, I am told, has been well kept up, tho' our poor friend never vi&s;ited it: I hope however it will not put you out of conceit with Man|&s;tock Hou&s;e."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"So long as you inhabit it,"</Q> &s;he replied, <Q REND="inline">"no place can rival Man&s;tock in my thoughts."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"But when you marry you may entertain other thoughts."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I will ne|ver marry any man capable of an attempt to detach me from a preference &s;o natural, &s;o un|alterable."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Then you mu&s;t not marry any man,"</Q> &s;aid Sir Roger, <Q REND="inline">who has a predilection for his own family &s;eat."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Having already one more than I want,"</Q> replied I&s;abella, &s;mil|ing, <Q REND="inline">"I hope you think there is no occa&s;ion for me to add to it."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I under&s;tand you,"</Q> &s;aid the father, in a tone of good-humour, <Q REND="inline">"the man to your mind mu&s;t have no encumbrances of

hou&s;e or home: he mu&s;t be without fortune."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"I confe&s;s,"</Q> an&s;wering quickly, &s;aid I&s;abella, <Q REND="inline">"I cou'd readily wave that, if he had virtue, courage, genero&s;ity, good &s;en&s;e, and di&s;cern|ment to re&s;pect and honour you; without the&s;e qualities I &s;hou'd de&s;pi&s;e him, had he the wealth of worlds."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"But you know no &s;uch per&s;on, not you,"</Q> &s;aid the Baronet, looking archly at her as he &s;poke; <Q REND="inline">"you have never met with any lover of this de&s;cription, and whil&s;t you per&s;i&s;t in &s;o many unrea&s;onable de|mands upon his character, probably you ne|ver will."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Not above once in my life, I dare &s;ay,"</Q> an&s;wered I&s;abella.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"And once is enough,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"if you are &s;ure of your man: look ye, daughter, I love fair dealing and confe&s;&s;ion; I fancy our friend G&mdash; and you are pretty much of the &s;ame opinion in this ca&s;e, for I ob&s;erve you &s;econded his en|comiums on a certain per&s;on with uncommon ardour; now I conceive, when a young lady is &s;o warm in the prai&s;es of a young man, and both parties are unmarried, it is a &s;trong pre|&s;umption that there is a liking in the ca&s;e; if &s;o, why not confe&s;s it? Seeing I have no other power over your mind, except by correcting your judgment where I think it errs, or con|firming
<PB N="305" REF="313">
your choice where I think it is well plac'd."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh! my dear, dear Sir,"</Q> replied the grate|ful dam&s;el, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hou'd be indeed unworthy of &s;o much goodne&s;s, if I did not meet your can|dour with the &s;incere&s;t expo&s;ition of my heart and its affections. Yes, my ever-hononr'd father, I will confe&s;s to you, and I tru&s;t I need not blu&s;h at the confe&s;&s;ion, that I contemplate Henry's character with admiration and de|light: I do believe it is a combination of all human virtues; and I ground my faith, not upon pre&s;umptive partial conjecture, but upon proofs which will bear the &s;tricte&s;t examina|tion, which cannot be contraverted by malice it&s;elf, and to mo&s;t of which you your&s;elf can witne&s;s. Let his conduct be &s;crutiniz'd from the fir&s;t moment that fortune threw him upon our mercy to the pre&s;ent in&s;tant; where can be found an example of &s;uch patience, resig|nation, fortitude; of &s;uch benevolence, bravery, genero&s;ity? What has he not endur'd, what has he not forgiven? Who ever made &s;uch di&s;intere&s;ted &s;acrifices to a principle of ju&s;tice and honour, in the mo&s;t refin'd, the mo&s;t ex|alted &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e virtues? Neither is he le&s;s to be admir'd for the purity of his morals
<PB N="306" REF="314">
than for the delicacy of his principles."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Well, well,"</Q> cried the Baronet, <Q REND="inline">"&s;o far, &s;o good; you have gone on bri&s;kly with his men|tal qualities, and I don't know that you have &s;aid a word too much; but what is it all, if that one thing &s;hou'd be wanting, without which no young lady ever yielded more than her approbation to the bed of men? If the per&s;on in which all the&s;e virtues center is not agreeable to you, if the form is not ele|gant, the manners not engaging, the addre&s;s not captivating, why then, you know, there can be no love in the heart, and prai&s;e is all that poor Henry is ever to expect from your lips."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Ah! my beloved Sir,"</Q> cried I&s;abella, blu&s;hing, yet with eyes that &s;hewed it was the blu&s;h of joy: <Q REND="inline">"now you are rallying me be|cau&s;e I have forborne to &s;peak of what I dare &s;ay you &s;u&s;pect was foremo&s;t in my thoughts; but in points of truth and fact there can be but one opinion, in matters of ta&s;te there may be many: it appears to me that nature has been as partial to Henry in per&s;on as in mind; you may not &s;ee him with the &s;ame eyes."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Not exactly, perhaps,"</Q> he replied, &s;miling; <Q REND="inline">but yet I can &s;ee enough to comprehend why Fanny Claypole fell in love with him, why Su|&s;an
<PB N="307" REF="315">
May was di&s;tracted for him, and why you, my dear I&s;abella, do not ab&s;olutely di&s;like him."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Di&s;like him,"</Q> echoed the fond dam|&s;el; <Q REND="inline">"Oh Heavens! I &s;hou'd be a wretch in|&s;en&s;ible to the fine&s;t work of the Creator, if I cou'd di&s;like him: &s;urely, Sir, nothing in the human form can be more perfect than Henry."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Come, come!"</Q> re&s;umed Sir Roger, <Q REND="inline">"you have made up for all deficiencies at la&s;t; more need not be attempted, for more, I think, can|not be &s;aid; and now, I&s;abella, having heard your confe&s;&s;ion, it is my turn to call upon your attention whil&s;t I make mine. In every thing your have &s;aid of Henry I perfectly concur; greater proof I cannot give you of my very high opinion of his merit and accompli&s;h|ments, than by a&s;&s;uring you, that the rea&s;ons I have hitherto had for oppo&s;ing your attach|ment to him, are, by recent circum&s;tances, in a great degree removed; and as want of for|tune alone wou'd in no in&s;tance have been my ab&s;olute objection, I &s;hall the le&s;s in&s;i&s;t upon it in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, fora&s;much as your means are now &s;o great as to make any further aug|mentation of them by marriage an object not worth attending to. In the place therefore of &s;everal impediments, I now &s;ee but one re|maining,
<PB N="308" REF="316">
and that is my ignorance of his birth and condition; I cannot di&s;pen&s;e with ob&s;cu|rity or meanne&s;s. Now altho' the my&s;tery is not clear'd up by the melancholy event of your cou&s;in's decea&s;e, yet the terror of it is remov'd from my mind by the circm&s;tances of her will; for I &s;hall now di&s;clo&s;e to you what I &s;hou'd never have mention'd whil&s;t Lady Crowbery was living, that there was &s;ome|thing in her deportment towards your friend Henry that gave me great unea&s;ine&s;s and alarm: not that I entertain'd &s;u&s;picions of the &s;ort which her imperious hu&s;band had, or af|fected to have, of their connection; no, that was not the nature of my terror; the thought was out of reach of probability; the character of the lady gave no countenance to it; on the contrary, there was &s;uch an air of ma|ternal tenderne&s;s in her regards, that I prote&s;t to you, I&s;abella, I found my&s;elf haunted by an idea, that the idle rumour which was &s;pread about the neighbourhood after my niece had elop'd with Mr. Delapoer might have been true, and that this &s;ame youth had been the unlawful i&s;&s;ue of that connection: under the impre&s;&s;ion of &s;uch an idea, you can't wonder at the vehemence with which I interdicted
<PB N="309" REF="317">
your corre&s;pondence with him; but now that I &s;ee him totally overlook'd in her will, I can no longer entertain any &s;u&s;picion of his &s;tand|ing in &s;o near a relation to her, and with that &s;u&s;picion of his being her &s;on, I now di&s;mi&s;s my oppo&s;ition to his preten&s;ions as your ad|mirer."</Q></P>
<P>Had Sir Roger Man&s;tock waited for an an&s;wer to this &s;peech, it would have been im|po&s;&s;ible for I&s;abella to have di&s;gui&s;ed the &s;en&s;a|tions it produced, &s;en&s;ations as oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e it was meant to convey as chilling di&s;ap|pointment is to thankful joy! But he was gone as &s;oon as he had uttered the concluding words, and gone in the per&s;ua&s;ion that he had made a being happy, who was infinitely dear to him, whil&s;t &s;he was left to reflect upon a &s;i|tuation now rendered far more hopele&s;s and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing than it had been in the wor&s;t of mo|ments, when his oppo&s;ition was more open and declared. Whil&s;t &s;he pondered upon this, her bo&s;om heaved with &s;ighs, and her eyes &s;treamed with tears. All tho&s;e fa&s;cinating ideas which her fond father's encouraging di&s;|cour&s;e had rai&s;ed in her mind were at once di&s;per&s;ed, and &s;ucceeded by a pre&s;s of thoughts that pre&s;ented nothing but de&s;pair and di&s;ap|pointment
<PB N="310" REF="318">
to her imagination. What to do &s;he knew not, and how to &s;hape her conduct in a dilemma &s;o full of difficulties, &s;he was incapable of deciding; for if &s;he availed her|&s;elf of her father's permi&s;&s;ion for re-admitting him into the family, what con&s;equence could en&s;ue from &s;uch a fruitle&s;s indulgence but an aggravation of regret, which every hour of increa&s;ing love and approbation would accu|mulate upon her? On the other hand, what would her father think, after the confe&s;&s;ion &s;he had made, if &s;he was now to hold back, when &s;he had his leave to advance? What, but that &s;he was the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate and capri|cious coquette in nature, who was no longer plea&s;ed than whil&s;t &s;he was oppo&s;ed, and had no wi&s;hes of her own when they were found to coincide with his? It was now, for the fir&s;t time, &s;he lamented the confidence that had been repo&s;ed in her by her decea&s;ed friend and benefactre&s;s; for being entru&s;ted with the &s;ecret, &s;he could in no ca&s;e violate her honour by betraying it; and being now made ac|quainted with her father's motives for pro&s;crib|ing Henry whil&s;t he &s;u&s;pected him to be the &s;on of his niece, no temptation upon earth could overcome her abhorrence of duplicity
<PB N="311" REF="319">
or deceit, whil&s;t he &s;hould retain a &s;entiment &s;o adver&s;e to that connection; and in this &s;he fore&s;aw no probability of change.</P>
<P>With heavy heart, therefore, we mu&s;t leave the unhappy I&s;abella to &s;truggle with the&s;e conflicting thoughts, and turn to other &s;cenes, that are prepared to open the &s;ucceeding book.</P>
