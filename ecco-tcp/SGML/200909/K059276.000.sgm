<HEAD>THE CASE OF THOMAS SPENCE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE annals of pro&s;ecutions do not pre&s;ent to the world a more extraordinary ca&s;e than that of the unfortunate man who is the &s;ubject of the following pages. It is not, however, for us, in the pre&s;ent &s;tage of this bu&s;ine&s;s, to declaim either again&s;t the laws of the Briti&s;h empire, or the per&s;ons to whom tho&s;e laws are entru&s;ted. An innocent man has nothing to fear from the &s;courge of truth&mdash;'tis the guilty only that need tremble at inve&s;tigation. The notorious character, of whatever &s;pecies, plea&s;ingly exults in the ob&s;curity of his depraved actions&mdash;but when the keen eye of di&s;covery penetrates his horrid man&s;ion, he would chearfully give a thou&s;and worlds to e&s;cape enquiry: It may be well for individuals, both of high and low degree, to mark the&s;e ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>Not to detain the reader with a long introduction, we &s;hall take the liberty of prefacing this narrative with a fictitious one, where the &s;cenes might have occurred in another country, and leave Engli&s;hmen to make what comments they plea&s;e. Suppo&s;e then the following oc|currences in Sweden or any other country, under what|ever governments your own minds may conceive.</P>
<P>It is pre&s;umed the laws of every government is very explicit, particularly with re&s;pect to tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions and puni&s;hments; this has been the boa&s;t of Britons, and we &s;hall think but little of France, till &s;he has, by intrin&s;ic
<PB N="4" REF="3">
merit, acquired that degree of eminence. In Sweden, however, we &s;uppo&s;e that a certain publication of exclamation and declamation were &s;ent into the world (&s;uch as Mr. Burke's for in&s;tance) violently condemning the principles of the Briti&s;h Revolution in 1688, and con&s;igning the abettors of that Revolution to de&s;truc|tion; that another per&s;on, of oppo&s;ite political principles, were hardy enough to attack the bold declaimer; and while ju&s;tifying &s;uch a Revolution, was to make &s;ome very &s;evere and pointed &s;trictures on the government of Sweden. Suppo&s;e then the legi&s;lature of Sweden finding the la&s;t writer had expo&s;ed &s;ome of their mal|pactices, and were to be fearful the contagion would &s;pread, whereby they might be deprived of their noble fea&s;ting, &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;in con&s;equence of which they deter|mined to in&s;titute an action again&s;t their bold competi|tor, in order to try the merits of the work, and, if po&s;|&s;ible, to condemn it by due cour&s;e of law;&mdash;&s;uppo&s;e they were to take advantage, by proclamations, &amp;c. and pro|&s;ecute <HI>poor</HI> individuals who might be found &s;elling the intended pro&s;cribed work, before it was actually pro|&s;cribed by a fair and regular trial&mdash;would not the in|dignation of every Engli&s;h &s;pectator be rai&s;ed at the littlene&s;s, the meanne&s;s, the wretchedne&s;s, of the Swedi&s;h legi&s;lators, who dared to violate the rights of man in &s;o fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">grant a manner? Oh Albion, how great are thy &s;u|perior privileges!</P>
<P>Immediately on the in&s;titution of a celebrated Society at the Crown and Anchor, for pre&s;erving places and pen&s;ions, Mr. Spence, being a poor man, and le&s;s likely to oppo&s;e the lordly menaces of violent Ari&s;tocracy, was repeatedly &s;urrounded, in&s;ulted, and even threatened with his life, and the de&s;truction of his little all, if he did not give up p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t of his bread, and decline &s;elling the Rights of Man, and other political tracts. The eager|ne&s;s of the public mind for political inve&s;tigation, almo&s;t rendered it u&s;ele&s;s for him to keep any other ar|ticles: and therefore, to a poor man, it was indeed a very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> us &s;acrifice, unle&s;s they had <HI>threatened</HI> him
<PB N="5" REF="4">
likewi&s;e with an amp&s;e compen&s;ation. Indeed their con|duct was contemptible, for no one of the oppo&s;ite party ever offered him the mo&s;t mode&s;t reproach for &s;elling even <HI>Mr. Burke's</HI> pamphets! It may be ob|&s;erved, that Mr. Spence, being &s;o expo&s;ed, with only a &s;tall in the open &s;treet, the&s;e petty beings, thought they might pre&s;ume on his unprotected &s;ituation. Even a pious Rector had the audacity to attack the defencele&s;s man, and endeavoured to avail him&s;elf of the natural in|fluence of his profe&s;&s;ion over the landlord, by urging him to turn Mr. Spence out of the &s;tall. Oh, Depra|vity, where is thy blu&s;h!</P>
<P>On Thur&s;day morning, Dec. 6, 1792, two runners, at the in&s;tance of a Mr. Reeves <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One of the runners has &s;ince called on Mr. Spence and in|formed him that it was by the de&s;ire of Mr. Chairman R&mdash;'s, that he took him up, and confe&s;&s;ed that he was heartily tired of &s;uch bu&s;ine&s;s;&mdash;that Mr. R. had never the genero&s;ity to pay him for the book which he ordered him to purcha&s;e for the official in|formation. We leave the chief political inqui&s;itor of England to the&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erene enjoyments which his newly a&s;&s;umed character &s;o ad|mirably in&s;pires.</NOTE>, came to T. Spence's &s;tall, and bought, by mi&s;take, Spence's Rights of Man, in&s;tead of Paine's Rights of Man. Immediately on which they took him, with their u&s;ual ceremony, before the civil magi&s;trate at the police office in Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ton Gar|den, and laid their information again&s;t him. To the honour of the magi&s;trate, however, he declined com|mitting Mr. Spence, as he could find no &s;tatute to ju&s;tify him in it. Mr. Spence told him in his defence, that he might as well commit every one who &s;old Gulliver's Travels, More's Eutropi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, Lock on Government, Puf|fendorf on the Law of Nature, &amp;c. &amp;c. all of which treated the &s;ubject of Government in a manner va&s;tly oppo&s;ite to the Briti&s;h &s;y&s;tem. Here, however, we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that no compen&s;ation was m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">de to Mr. Spence for tearing him, like a criminal, from his bu|&s;ine&s;s, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Monday, the 10th of December, between two and three o'clock, two of the Bow-&s;treet runners came to Mr. Spence, and purcha&s;ed Paine's Rights of Man; after which
<PB N="6" REF="5">
in the mo&s;t unprecedented manner, without even &s;hew|ing the lea&s;t authority, they obliged him to put up the &s;hutters of his &s;tall, and hu&s;tled him into an hackney-coach, which they ordered to be driven to Bow-&s;treet. During the bu&s;tle and the journey, Mr. Spence, feeling, very properly, the indignity offered both to law and ju&s;tice by the&s;e proceedings, remon&s;trated with the pro&s;tituted ruffians, and mode&s;tly a&s;ked them whether he was to con&s;ider him&s;elf in Spain, Turkey, Algiers, or England? It appeared to him as though he were en|chanted to one of the mo&s;t de&s;potic &s;pots in the univer&s;e. Never perhaps were the rights of citizens &s;o &s;hamefully invaded as in this in&s;tance; nor &s;hall we wonder if the complaints of individuals in this re&s;pect &s;hould drive them to acts of de&s;peration&mdash;may the great God however avert &s;uch a cata&s;trophe!</P>
<P>When the unfortunate pri&s;oner arrived at Bow-&s;treet, the magi&s;trate was at dinner; of cour&s;e the victim of de|&s;poti&s;m was carried to a public hou&s;e near the office, where he was &s;afely guarded, at lea&s;t three hours, till his wor&s;hip had fini&s;hed his repa&s;t. In this ble&s;&s;ed man&s;ion the runners, by what authority can hardly be gue&s;&s;ed, (un|le&s;s their honourable profe&s;&s;ion warranted it,) &s;earched Mr. Spence's pockets, and even took from him his pocket book, papers and memorandums relating to his bu&s;ine&s;s, &amp;c. which they have never yet returned. The pocket|book contained extracts from Locke, Puffendorf, Swift, Pope, and even the 25th chapter of the book of Leviti|cus, all of which related to government, and may, ac|cording to the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of proceedings, be equally termed libellous. Perhaps &s;ince the days of bloody Queen Mary have no pri&s;oner, under the &s;ame circum&s;tances, been treated in &s;o violent a manner as Mr. Spence was during his &s;tay in the public hou&s;e. Will it be credited that a man, a&s;&s;uming the air of a gentleman, could wan|touly in&s;ult even the mo&s;t guilty felon; and yet it is a fact, that a per&s;on of &s;uch a de&s;cription &s;eized Mr. Spence by the throat, and had not fear prevented, would willingly have &s;trangled him&mdash;uttering the mo&s;t horrid imprecations that he was not warranted in carrying his
<PB N="7" REF="6">
inveterate malice to &s;uch an extreme. Well, indeed' might Mr. Spence exclaim, What country am I in! Na|ture &s;hudders at the relation of in&s;tances of &s;uch depra|vity in the human race; and tho&s;e de&s;picable characters &s;carcely de&s;erve the epithet of <HI>human,</HI> much le&s;s the ani|mating title of Britons! It &s;urely will hardly be credited hereafter that the&s;e are the actions of the eighteenth cen|tury! Better for Engli&s;hmen openly to reque&s;t a Ba&s;tile&mdash; they would then at lea&s;t be on their guard. In the pre&s;ent in&s;tance they have been gro&s;sly mi&s;led into the violation of laws which they have under&s;tood were never promul|gated, and are treated as traitors for crimes they never dreamt of. The book had not been condemned by a legal proce&s;s, and they had always been taught that no crime attached it&s;elf to &s;elling any publication till it was thus legally pro&s;cribed. Is not this the language of al|mo&s;t every per&s;on both in the Hou&s;e of Commons and out of it?</P>
<P>It is folly&mdash;it is madne&s;s for men in the&s;e days idly to chatter about their darling hobby hor&s;e&mdash;<HI>Liberty.</HI> A great part of them in the mid&s;t of &s;uch childi&s;h excla|mations are po&s;itively endeavouring to <HI>outrun</HI> each other; and by <HI>nick-named</HI> loyalty <HI>eagerly</HI> &s;triving which &s;hall &s;acri|fice his <HI>deare&s;t</HI> intere&s;t, and the intere&s;t of his po&s;terity to the <HI>mo&s;t inflexible de&s;poti&s;m</HI> that <HI>ever</HI> di&s;graced the world. (The&s;e ob&s;ervations cannot apply to Engli&s;hmen.)</P>
<P>We mu&s;t now direct the reader's attention to the tran&s;|actions in the Public Office. After the u&s;ual technical formula Mr. Spence reque&s;ted his wor&s;hip to inform him by what authority his journeymen were ju&s;tified in their proceedings? With all the &s;agacity which the nature of the ca&s;e in&s;pired, his wor&s;hip adverted to the Royal Pro|clamations, and even to the opinion of the Grand Jury. Mr. Spence was naturally led to doubt either the validity of indifinite Proclamations, or the legality of the opi|nion of the Grand Jury, in ju&s;tification of arbitrary pro|ceedings, previous to a public trial. However, agree|able to the natural order of things, the pri&s;oner being the weake&s;t party, was obliged to &s;ubmit.&mdash;To the ho|nor, or rather to the di&s;grace, of the mercenary attend|ants
<PB N="8" REF="7">
of Public Offices, Mr. Spence was a&s;&s;ailed by a con|&s;iderable party with threats and violent pu&s;hes, that even the American Indians would have thought a di&s;grace to their &s;avage manners. With all the deliberation and coolne&s;s &s;o characteri&s;tic of a blood-thir&s;ty crew, the in&s;truments of this extraordinary bu&s;ine&s;s delivered an exaggerated evidence, fearing perhaps, they &s;hould be deprived of their emoluments by the pri&s;oner's e&s;cape. When will man reflect and con&s;ider the true dignity of the human &s;pecies, by acting conformable to his judg|ment, and de&s;pi&s;ing every thing that may impeach his integrity! This will apply from the highe&s;t character in &s;tates through every gradation, civil and official, down to the common hangman. With a very ill grace then does it become the implements of abu&s;es to &s;train every nerve both of violence and inju&s;tice, for &s;ecuring to them&s;elves the wretched enjoyment of places, which in their own con&s;ciences they hold contemptible.</P>
<P>The runners (will it be credited?) had the con&s;um|mate impudence to threaten this unfortunate man with leading him through the &s;treets heavy ironed, if he would not &s;ubmit to pay the hire of a coach to Clerkenwell Pri&s;on; nay, they had the audacity to bring forth irons for the purpo&s;e. Mr. Spence, however, with that dignity, which con&s;cious innocence naturally in&s;pires, &s;purned the mon&s;ters and their threats, and told them he would rather &s;ubmit to be led like a felon, than &s;uf|fer &s;uch an impo&s;ition. At length they con&s;ented to conduct him to goal without tho&s;e unnece&s;&s;ary imple|ments, where he arrived about eleven o'clock at night. Here Mr. Spence was u&s;hered in with the u&s;ual &s;aluta|tions of the collegia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">c officers, which con&s;i&s;ted of the mo&s;t abu&s;ive menaces and illiberal treatment that their ingenu|ity could po&s;&s;ibly invent. He was a&s;ked whether he cho&s;e to have a bed; and upon an&s;wering in the affirma|tive, an immediate demand of one &s;hilling was made by one of the turnkeys for that indulgence&mdash;he had likewi&s;e one penny to pay for the u&s;e of a candle, which the turnkey held in his hand; nor did the wretch allow him time to take off his cloaths before he locked him up in a &s;o|litary
<PB N="9" REF="8">
cell.&mdash;The bed was &s;o immoderately damp as to oblige him to lay down in his cloaths, and in the morning he found him&s;elf &s;o poorly as led him to fear the con&s;e|quences.</P>
<P>In the morning Mr. Spence was taken from his for|lorn dungeon, and &s;ent down into the yard among the mo&s;t common felons, where he was acco&s;ted by the mi&s;erable collegians in their u&s;ual &s;tile.</P>
<P>The poor wretches always rejoice to &s;ee &s;trangers introduced, as it is cu&s;tomary for them to apply to every New Pri&s;oner for <HI>garni&s;h,</HI> either that they may allay the cravings of hunger, or drown the recollec|tion of their unhappy &s;ituations in liquor. To add to his misfortunes, Mr. Spence was obliged to comply with all their demands, or be denied the privilege of citizen&s;hip even among them; and it co&s;t him in goal fees, garni&s;h, &amp;c. in the cour&s;e of thirty hours, previous to being libe|rated by bail, one pound four &s;hillings, which to a poor man is a great &s;um.</P>
<P>During the ab&s;ence of Mr. Spence from his &s;tall, &s;ome mi&s;chievous per&s;on or per&s;ons (perhaps delegated from the <HI>u&s;ual &s;ource</HI>) had the impudence to write three &s;epa|rate papers and &s;tick them on his &s;hutters, purporting, "That the owner was confined in gaol for &s;elling &s;editious books; and they hoped it would be a warning to others."</P>
<P>The Public need only be informed that the Grand-Jury, afterwards found a true Bill of Indictment again&s;t Mr. Spence, and it remains for him now to await a judicial deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>To enumerate the numerous per&s;ecutions which Mr. Spence has endured previous to the foregoing Pro|ce&s;s; and &s;ince, would take more time than the Editor could well &s;pare.</P>
<P>One in&s;tance, however, it would be almo&s;t unpardon|able to pa&s;s over unnoticed. On Thur&s;day the 13th of December, the day his Maje&s;ty opened the pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, a gentleman, or one who aimed to be thought &s;o, came to Mr. Spence's &s;tall, and, &s;eeing a young man with the fir&s;t part of Paine's Rights of Man in his
<PB N="10" REF="9">
hand (which by the bye has never been even di&s;puted by the Attorney-General), &s;eized the book, and in a curious (alias Grub-&s;treet) dialect, abu&s;ed Mr. Spence, hu&s;tled him about, tore his &s;hirt, and dragged him to an adjoining &s;hop, where, joined by more of his <HI>brutal fraternity,</HI> he robbed the poor man of two other books. One of the villains ha&s;tened to the Police Office to fetch &s;ome run|ners, while the others guarded the per&s;ecuted man, uttering violent threats, &s;avage menaces, &amp;c. &amp;c. The &s;pectators, however, to their honour be it mentioned, ob&s;erving the lengths the ruffians would carry their infamous conduct, calmly interfered and re&s;cued the pri&s;oner from the hands of the mo&s;t <HI>diabolical</HI> and <HI>lawle&s;s banditti</HI> that ever threatened the peace of the metropolis. Perhaps the&s;e were &s;ome of the <HI>immaculate</HI> members of a certain <HI>inqui&s;itorial Society;</HI> at lea&s;t they mu&s;t be &s;anc|tioned by a dark and my&s;terious group, not le&s;s diabolical than them&s;elves.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>REFLECTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>The pre&s;ent aerea &s;eems as a dream, one can &s;carcely credit the tran&s;actions of every preceding day. <HI>Truth</HI> is a libel, and <HI>fal&s;hood</HI> is a libel&mdash;how then to &s;teer between the two extremes, requires the &s;agacity of a knave, or the duplicity of a hypocrite. To what a &s;ituation is the intellects of man reduced! Were it po&s;&s;ible to deprive the numerous hoards of mankind (with very few ex|ceptions) of their rational faculties&mdash;to dive&s;t them of thinking&mdash;to re&s;train them from &s;peaking&mdash;to draw a veil over their occult powers&mdash;and cancel their &s;en&s;ibi|lity; it would be perfectly conformable with prevailing politics to attempt the experiment. Infatuation and ig|norance&mdash;depravity and corruption&mdash;violence and in|trigue, &s;eem united again&s;t the progre&s;s of knowledge, and the intere&s;t of &s;ociety. The world, however, has ever been governed by fluctuations, and what one age or one de&s;cription of beings have e&s;timated as ble&s;&s;ings, &s;ucceeding ages or a different de&s;cription of beings have e&s;timated as cur&s;es. Perhaps &s;ome degree of propriety
<PB N="11" REF="10">
has attached it&s;elf to each party, and rational minds have only been able to contemplate the con&s;equences, without the power of affording any alleviation to the victims of contention. But may we not anticipate a better age, and a &s;uperior degree of civilization; when &s;ociety will be united under one intere&s;t, and man be no more the dupe of faction&mdash;when peace will &s;pread her genial wings and leave the human mind to the en|joyment of tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings which nature has &s;o bounte|fully be&s;towed, when indu&s;try will be relieved from the almo&s;t in&s;urmountable fetters of the pre&s;ent hour, and the only barrier to civil enjoyments will be tho&s;e of vicious inclinations.</P>
<P>A review of the numerous characters of Europe, who, with minds that would do honour to the higher ranks, but from the largne&s;s of their families, and political cir|cum&s;tances are bowed down with poverty and oppre&s;&s;ion, will fully ju&s;tify the feeling mind in ardently panting for &s;o glorious an aera.</P>
<P>On Monday the 24th of December, Mr. Spence re|ceived the following notice from his landlord by the hands of the landlord's daughter.</P>
<LETTER>

<P>The young woman remarked to Mr. Spence, on deli|vering the above, that &s;everal of her father's cu&s;tomers had threatened to withdraw their favours and intere&s;t, if he &s;uffered Mr. S. to contiue on the premi&s;es.&mdash; What con&s;olation they can derive from being the means of depriving an hone&s;t man of his livelihood, would exceedingly puzzle a generous mind to di&s;cover. We may, however, fairly hope that the party who &s;o &s;trongly have &s;upported the efforts of de&s;poti&s;m, will impartially recon&s;ider their conduct; and we doubt not but they will find occa&s;ion &s;ufficient to blu&s;h, and be &s;orry at the con&s;equences that mu&s;t inevitably follow their exer|tions.</P>

<P>I take the grievance of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of election to be its <HI>gro&s;s inequality.</HI> All the electors in Great-Bri|tain do not amount to <HI>one-&s;ixth</HI> part of the whole people and a &s;till greater inequality &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in elections made by that &s;ixth part; for <HI>one-&s;eventh part of them</HI> elect a ma|jority, &s;o that <HI>one-forty-&s;econd</HI> part of the nation di&s;po&s;e of the <HI>prpeerty of the whole,</HI> and have their <HI>lives and li|berties at command.</HI> And this forty-&s;econd part, far from con&s;i&s;ting of the mo&s;t opulent part of the kingdom, is compo&s;ed of the &s;mall boroughs, mo&s;t of which are be|come either the private property of individuals, or are
<PB N="13" REF="12">
notoriou&s;ly &s;old to the be&s;t bidder: &s;o that counties and great cities are, in fact, as well as the great ma&s;s of the people &s;wallowed up by this <HI>&s;y&s;tem of corruption.</HI></P>
<P>My ideas of reform undoubtedly go to one that &s;hall be <HI>complete and general throughout the kingdom.</HI> I &s;ee &s;uch fatal con&s;equences ari&s;e from the pre&s;ent partial and accidental &s;tate of election, that I cannot take upon me to propo&s;e any new mode that partakes of the &s;ame de|fects. If we do not differ from the <HI>abettors of corruption</HI> upon the broad principle of inequality in election, and the <HI>univer&s;al right of the people to be repre&s;ented,</HI> and are contending only for a degree of partiality, more or le&s;s, I fear our ground is not &s;ound: if we mean only to &s;ub|&s;titute partiality for partiality, and are &s;truggling but for its extent, one man's whim may be as good as another's conceit, and we have nothing certain to direct us; and if inequality is &s;till to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, the advocates of the pre|&s;ent &s;y&s;tem will have the &s;anction of time and the ri&s;k of changes, to oppo&s;e to us, which will have their weight, when it is but for a change of partiality that we contend.</P>
<P>I have thought that a <HI>Parliamentary Reform</HI> had much more &s;imple and unerring guides to lead us to our end; I mean the <HI>true principles of the Con&s;titution,</HI> and the <HI>Rights of the People.</HI> If the&s;e exi&s;t, I do not con|&s;ider my&s;elf at liberty to &s;peculate upon &s;y&s;tem. I have no choice, but to give to every man his own.</P>
<P>How far it is wi&s;e for tho&s;e who entirely agree in principle upon the <HI>Rights of Men,</HI> to endeavour to per|&s;uade them, that the <HI>recovery of their birth-rights, and mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential intere&s;ts,</HI> "are not reducible to practice, nor attainable by any regular or con&s;titutional efforts of theirs," is what I mu&s;t leave others to determine. But the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion is what I can never &s;ub&s;cribe to. I cannot but think that this nation ever has it in its own power, by <HI>peaceful and con&s;titutional efforts, to do it&s;elf ju&s;tice;</HI> and that nothing can render attempts for this purpo&s;e impracticable, but either a <HI>general indolence</HI> and <HI>indifference to all that requires exertion</HI> though for the <HI>noble&s;t purpo&s;es,</HI> or prejudice to favourite &s;y&s;tems, as &s;hall divide the people.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="13">To guard again&s;t &s;uch an imputation falling on me, I mo&s;t readily agree to an addre&s;s in the mo&s;t gene|ral terms, not pointing to any &s;pecific mode of reform in the petition, or by in&s;tructions to our members, or by re&s;olutions, but &s;ubmitting the remedy, as in my opinion it ought to be, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, to Parlia|ment it&s;elf; which I conceive to be as equal to &s;uch a con&s;ideration as any Provincial Committee.</P>
<P>Should Mr. WYVIL'S fir&s;t or &s;econd plan be pro|po&s;ed in Parliament, or any thing like it, although I &s;hall lament that we, for a moment, quit our advantageous ground of the <HI>Con&s;titution,</HI> and the <HI>Rights of Men,</HI> yet I &s;hall certainly give every &s;upport in my power to this or any other amendment, and it certainly will be a con&s;i|derable improvement, that in&s;tead of a forty-&s;econd, it &s;hould be a thirty-&s;ixth or thirtieth part that &s;hall de|cide the concerns of the whole people. It will be &s;ome|thing material they will have gained, and may become a &s;tep to the more ea&s;y attainment of their privileges.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t &s;incerely hope that that plan may be found attainable; but I never can con&s;ent to tell the people, and I hope to God they never will believe, that the re|covery of any right, which Nature and the Con&s;titution have given them, is impracticable. On the contrary, convinced my&s;elf, I wi&s;h them ever to believe, that whenever they plea&s;e to claim, they <HI>will</HI> and <HI>mu&s;t</HI> have the <HI>full extent of their Rights.</HI></P>
<P>I have thought nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay thus much on an impre&s;&s;ion I cannot think indifferent the public &s;hould entertain.</P>
<P>The mea&s;ure, for which you are a&s;&s;embled, meets with my hearty concurrence, and I &s;hall be happy if the&s;e my &s;entiments, which I beg you would communi|cate to the meeting of the county of Su&s;&s;ex, &s;hould meet with their approbation.</P>

<HEAD>ANECDOTE of JOHN, THE GREAT DUKE OF ARGYLE.</HEAD>
<P>Captain Hull, of the hor&s;e-grenadiers, waiting one morning on the Duke, about bu&s;ine&s;s, was &s;hewn into a large room, where he found his Grace walking about, pen&s;ively, and &s;o lo&s;t in thought, that at fir&s;t he took no notice of Hull; but &s;oon after, turning his eyes that way, apologized for not &s;eeing him &s;ooner; on which Captain Hull an&s;wered, "He feared he had interrupted his Grace's thoughts about &s;omething of more con&s;e|quence than his bu&s;ine&s;s." (for the Duke was a real pa|triot, virtuous, wi&s;e, and valiant) "Not to you and me, Hull," &s;ays the Duke, "however, I'll tell you what I was thinking of; I was con&s;idering what will be the con&s;equence, fifty years <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, of the bad education of &s;ix parts out of &s;even of our young nobility. They are brought up with a little &s;uperficial learning, introduced early into company, plea&s;ure, and di&s;&s;ipation of all &s;orts; then &s;ent to travel before they know any thing of their own country, or mankind, and the part they ought to act as men; abroad they are flattered, duped, and laugh|ed at, and return home corrupted both in head and heart. While they are thus employed, all the u&s;eful &s;en&s;e, learn|ing, and knowledge, will be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the middling cla&s;s of people, who mu&s;t of cour&s;e de&s;pi&s;e a luxurious, idle, gaming nobility. And as time and accidents will widen the breach between them (unle&s;s Providence gra|ciou&s;ly interferes) confu&s;ion in the end mu&s;t follow: for the idlers will be for arbitrary power, that they may act the tyrant over their inferiors; not con&s;idering, by this &s;tep they are &s;laves them&s;elves, and have given up the great|e&s;t ble&s;&s;ings in life. But the men of learning and Science will li&s;t under Liberty, knowing men are by Nature equal, and that all power is delegated from the people for their protection and &s;ecurity; and from hence con|vul&s;ions may ari&s;e, which &s;carce you or I will live to &s;ee." &mdash;<HI>Vide</HI> The Weekly Mi&s;cellany for Feb. 8, 1779.</P>
