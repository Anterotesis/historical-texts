THE CITY OF CARLISLE.</HEAD>
<P>THE traveller approaching from the &s;outh, has the be&s;t view of the city, &s;eat|ed on a fine eminence, gradually emerging from an exten&s;ive plain of rich cultivated land. The waters of the Frith are &s;een on the one hand, with the ad|jacent levells; the back ground of the land&s;cape is beautifully variegated by the irregular &s;wells of the whole Scotch promontory, extending towards the Iri&s;h &s;ea. The walls &s;trengthened with an arrangement of buttre&s;&s;es at irregular di&s;tances, lies upon one angle to the view; in part, concealing the hou&s;es of the city, and boldly overtoped by the &s;quare tower of the ca&s;tle, and the augu&s;t and &s;olemn &s;tructure of the cathedral. This view of Carli&s;le is the more &s;triking, as there is no adjacent eminence; from which cau&s;e the city looks more maje&s;tic, as it crowns &s;o beautiful a plain.</P>
<P>The city is walled round, the fortifications towards Scotland appearing the mo&s;t modern; they are formed of better &s;quared &s;tones than &s;everal other parts of the works. The ea&s;t and &s;outh &s;ides are &s;upported by a multitude of buttre&s;&s;es, which, we pre&s;ume, have been built up occa&s;ionally, to &s;trengthen the decaying parts of the wall. It is watered by three fine rivers, the Eden on the north, the Peterill on the ea&s;t, and Caude on the we&s;t. There are three gates to the city, which, from their different a&s;pects, are called the Engli&s;h, Iri&s;h, and Scotch Gates. On
<PB N="4" REF="6">the approach from Penrith, on the &s;outh, you enter the Engli&s;h Gates; on the ap|proach from Wigton, on the &s;outh-we&s;t, is the Iri&s;h Gate; and the Scotch Gate, to the north, opens upon the bridges. The walls are embrazured, but without any earth-work. The Engli&s;h Gate is guarded by a very &s;trong machicolated gate, flanked by circular towers of great &s;trength; the guns mounted therein in &s;everal tiers, would effectually &s;weep every approach. This gateway, with its towers and other works, is commonly called the Citadel,
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">"An oblong with three round ba&s;tions."&mdash;PENNANT.&mdash;The ancient entrance into the city was through the citadel.</NOTE> and was erected by the order of King Henry VIII. The ca&s;tle con&s;i&s;ts of various works, but being kept up as a garri&s;oned place, we conceive it imprudent to de&s;cribe them minutely.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>There were &s;everal officers appointed to this fortre&s;s, viz. a governor, deputy governor, town-major, engineer, barrack-ma&s;ter, &s;tore-keeper, head gunner, three quarter gunners, and a per&s;on to buy in and deliver out coals and candles to the garri&s;on. For many years, prior to 1761, the governor of this city was cho&s;en from one of the repre&s;entatives in parliament; and mo&s;t of the &s;ubordinate places in the gar|ri&s;on were given to the freemen of the city, and generally members of the corporation, &s;o that frequently the chief magi&s;trate was a quarter gunner.&mdash;L. [For a li&s;t of the governors &s;ee page 595.</P></NOTE> The donjon, or great tower, more properly de&s;erves the title of the citadel, being &s;urrounded by the other works; it is &s;quare and very lofty, and the walls of va&s;t &s;trength and thickne&s;s, being con&s;tructed agreeably to the old modes of defence, before the u&s;e of cannon: it was &s;trengthened by a draw bridge over a wide ditch, and defended by modern works; a half-moon battery mounted with cannon, and a very large platform al&s;o mounted with cannon, under cover of the outward wall. The top of the tower being embrazured and lined with turf, and mounted with large cannon, this part of the fortre&s;s could make a good defence, and &s;u&s;tain a formidable attack. By a well of va&s;t depth con&s;tructed within the great tower, and &s;aid to be of Roman work, the &s;upply of water for the garri&s;on could not be cut off by an enemy. This well is not unlike that in Bambrough Ca&s;tle in Nor|thumberland, and has been con&s;tructed at the &s;ame time the great tower was built.
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>In the gates of the ca&s;tle, is &s;till remaining the old Portcullis: and here are &s;hewn the apartments of Mary, Queen of Scots, where &s;he was lodged &s;ome time after her landing at Workington; and after being, for a little &s;pace, entertained with flattering re&s;pect, found her&s;elf pri&s;oner to her jealous rival.</P></NOTE> In the outer ca&s;tle is a fine gra&s;s plot, a garden and governor's hou&s;e.</P>
<P>But it will be expected by our readers, that we give a more particular de&s;crip|tion of this city, and collect the hi&s;torical facts relative to it.</P>
<P>The name of Carli&s;le has been deduced by &s;everal authors, from different ety|mologies. The Briti&s;h chronicle informs us, this city was built by a Briti&s;h potentate, called Luel. Leland &s;ays, <Q>the Iri&s;hmen call <HI>bale</HI> a town, and &s;o peradventure did the old Scottes: thus might be &s;aid that <HI>lugabalia</HI> &s;oundeth <HI>Luel's-town.</HI></Q>
<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><P>Lel. Itin. v. vii. p. 48.&mdash;In Leland's Collectaniae, vol. ii. p. 19. Extract from the 14th chapter, of the 1&s;t book of Galfridus, <Q>Qui ut properitate regni u&s;us e&s;t, in Aquilonari parte Britanniae civitatem aedificavit, quam de nomine ejus Caer-leil vocant.</Q> Leil alias Luel, filius Bruti. cog. viridis &s;cuti, condidit Caerliel.</P></NOTE> The Romans called it <HI>Lugovallium,</HI> or <HI>Luguballum,</HI> from its &s;i|tuation on Severus' wall, and from the troops and people garri&s;oned there. <HI>Ptolemy</HI> calls it <HI>Leucopibi, Nennius Caer Lualid.</HI> The Saxons retained the old name <HI>Luel;</HI> the Wel&s;h writers give it the name of the city of <HI>Duballus.</HI> Some derive the name
<PB N="5" REF="7">from the ancient Briti&s;h <HI>Llu-gyda-gwal,</HI> which implies <HI>an army by the wall;</HI> from whence it is a&s;&s;erted the Romans framed their appellation of <HI>Lugovallium;</HI> others from <HI>Lagus,</HI> or <HI>Lucus,</HI> which, in the language of the <HI>Celtae</HI> and Britains, &s;ignified a tower; and which, with the Roman compound, expre&s;&s;ed <HI>a tower or fort upon the wall or vallum:</HI> to the Saxon name was added, the word <HI>caer,</HI> or city; and from the&s;e, <HI>Caer Leuel,</HI> the pre&s;ent name of <HI>Car-li&s;le,</HI> &s;eems to come by an ea&s;y corrup|tion. It is rea&s;onable to apprehend, that in &s;o fine a &s;ituation, on the confluence of three rivers, and the grand e&s;tuarie of the Frith, this place was of &s;ome &s;trength and di&s;tinction before the coming of the Romans: it will naturally follow, that the name was given antecedent to the building of Severus' wall, or the vallum of Hadrian; and we conceive that Leland points out the mo&s;t probable etymology. <HI>Camden</HI> and his editors have taken great pains on this &s;ubject, <Q>The Romans and Britains called it <HI>Luguvallum</HI> and <HI>Luguballium,</HI> or <HI>Luguballia;</HI> the Saxons, as <HI>Bede</HI> writeth, <HI>Luel; Ptolemy,</HI> as &s;ome think, <HI>Lucopibia,</HI> (which &s;eems rather to be a corruption of <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>i. e.</HI> white hou&s;es, and to be <HI>Candida Ca&s;a,</HI> or <HI>Whithorn</HI> in <HI>Galloway</HI>) <HI>Nemicus Caer Lualid;</HI> the ridiculous Wel&s;h prophecies, <HI>the city of Duballus;</HI> we <HI>Carli&s;le;</HI> and the Latins, from the more modern name, <HI>Carleolum.</HI> For that <HI>Luguballia</HI> and Carli&s;le are the &s;ame, is univer&s;ally agreed by our hi&s;torians. But as to the etymology, what pains has our countryman, <HI>Leland,</HI> taken about it, and at la&s;t he is driven upon this &s;hift, that <HI>Ituna</HI> might be called <HI>Lugas,</HI> and that <HI>Ballum</HI> came from <HI>Vallis,</HI> a valley, and &s;o make <HI>Lugu|vallum,</HI> as much as a <HI>valley</HI> upon the <HI>Luge.</HI> But to give my conjectures al&s;o, I dare affirm, that the <HI>vallum</HI> and <HI>valia</HI> were derived from that famous military <HI>vallum</HI> of the <HI>Romans,</HI> which runs hard by the city. For <HI>Antoninus</HI> calls <HI>Lugu|vallum ad vallum;</HI> and the Picts wall, which was afterwards built on the wall of <HI>Severus,</HI> is to be &s;een at Stanwicks, a &s;mall village a little beyond the Eden. It pa&s;&s;ed the river over again&s;t the ca&s;tle; where, in the very channel, the remains of it, namely, great &s;tones appear to this day. Al&s;o, <HI>Pomponius Mela</HI> has told us, that <HI>lugus</HI> or <HI>lucus</HI> &s;ignified a <HI>tower</HI> among the old <HI>Celtae,</HI> who &s;poke the &s;ame language with the Britains; for what <HI>Antoninus</HI> calls <HI>lugo augu&s;ti,</HI> is in him <HI>turris augu&s;ti;</HI> &s;o that <HI>luguvallum,</HI> both really is, and &s;ignifies <HI>a tower or fort upon the wall or vallum.</HI> Upon this foundation, if the French had made their <HI>lugdunum</HI> &s;ignify a tower upon a hill, and their <HI>lucotetia</HI> (&s;o the ancients called what we call <HI>lutetia</HI>) a beautiful tower; for the words import &s;o much in the Briti&s;h, they might po&s;&s;ibly have been more in the right, than by deriving the latter from <HI>lutum,</HI> dirt; and the former from one <HI>Lugdus,</HI> a fabulous king. As to the pre&s;ent name, <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> the original of this is plain enough, from the Briti&s;h, <HI>caer,</HI> a city; and <HI>Lual, Luel, Lugubal, Leil,</HI> or <HI>Luil,</HI> according to the &s;everal appella|tions, antient or modern, importing as much as <HI>the town or city of Luul,</HI> &amp;c.</Q>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr. Gough's additions are, "Dr. Gale derives it from <HI>lle,</HI> an army; and <HI>gual,</HI> the wall; as <HI>lugdu|num</HI> from <HI>llu;</HI> and <HI>dun,</HI> a hill; for Tacitus &s;ays, the Lyonnois called them&s;elves a Roman colony, and part of the army.

<P>In Dr. Todd's MS. we have &s;everal quotations, relative to the etymology of the name, from Itin. Antiron. Ptolemy's Geog, Bede, &amp;c. which are compri&s;ed in what is &s;et forth in the text.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="8">It has been the opinion of &s;everal judicious vi&s;itants, that the river Eden has &s;hifted its cour&s;e and channel &s;ince the time of the Romans, and that formerly it pa&s;&s;ed nearer to the ca&s;tle; for it &s;hould &s;eem an incon&s;i&s;tent ta&s;k for that wi&s;e people, to make their work traver&s;e a rapid and broad river, otherwi&s;e than in a direct line. Both Mr. Hor&s;ley, and Mr. Warburton join in this opinion.</P>
<P>It may &s;afely be determined, that the Romans found this a place of &s;ome im|portance; but that it was, in their time, rather a place of rece&s;s after the toils of warfare were over, than a place of chief &s;trength, appears from the vicinity of Stanwix, the &s;tation in cour&s;e upon the wall. It is not to be doubted, but Caer-Luel was fortified, as it lay too near the borders not to be &s;ubject to perils and alarms; but we have no Roman authorities, to denominate it a regular Roman city or &s;tation; as we find tho&s;e neare&s;t to the wall, on the &s;outh, were Olenacum, now called Old Carlifle, near Wigton; and Bremetenracum, called old Perith. The words of Camden and his editors are, <Q>That this city flouri&s;hed in the time of the Romans, appears plainly enough from the &s;everal evidences of antiquity, which they now and then dig up; and from the frequent mention made of it, by the writers of tho&s;e times. And even after the ravages of the Picts and Scots, it retained &s;omething of its ancient &s;plendor, and was accounted a city.</Q>
<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>That it was a place of &s;trength in the time of the Romans, is evident; not only from the men|tion of it, in the accounts they took of Britain, when they had made it a province of the empire but al&s;o from Roman mounments, and in&s;criptions that have been &s;ome time dug up here; one whereof is mentioned by Malm&s;bury, p. 258. to have been di&s;covered in the time of William Rufus.</Q></P>

<P>We have no authority to determine what was the &s;ize or form of this place in di&s;tant antiquity. Leland &s;ays in his Itinerary, vol. VII. p. 48. <Q>The hole &s;ite of the towne, is &s;ore chaungid.q For whereas the &s;tretes were, and great edifices, now be vacant and garden plottes.

<P><PB N="7" REF="9">After the retreat of the Romans, we may naturally conceive, this city would &s;oon be evacuated by the Britons, and de&s;troyed and laid wa&s;te by the northern nations, who made con&s;tant irruptions, and at length extended their rapine and deva&s;tation into the &s;outhern, and interior parts of Britain, till repre&s;&s;ed by the coming in of the Saxon allies. It would even be a con&s;iderable time after their introduction, before they could extend their arms to the&s;e we&s;tern parts. During this period, and in the darkne&s;s in which the hi&s;tory of tho&s;e ages is involved, we are left to conjecture, that this now flouri&s;hing city lay in a&s;hes and ruin, till ******* Egfrid po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the diadem of Northumbria, carried his conque&s;t to the we&s;tern ocean. The Britons in this mountainous country, long retained their natural ferocity, and &s;upported their uncivilized liberty and independance. Egfrid had Cumberland as a tributary province of his kingdom; and from that period we gain &s;ome degree of certainty in the hi&s;tory of this place.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Bede &s;ays, that Northumberland and the Picts, Scotts, and Britons, in the northern parts, were in perfect peace, one with another, in the year of God 731; and that there was &s;uch re&s;pect and re|verence given to religion, that per&s;ons of the be&s;t quality de&s;ired to be admitted to the offices of the church: but not long after this, the Britons or Cumbees, who had been &s;cattered in the&s;e parts ever &s;ince the rece&s;s of the Roman legions, began to unite them&s;elves under a government of their own, cal|ling their province or kingdom, <HI>Cumberland,</HI> or the land of the Cumbri.<BIBL>&mdash;Dr. TODD'S MS.</BIBL></Q></NOTE></P>
<P>The fir&s;t certain account we have of Carli&s;le, is in the &s;eventh century of the Chri&s;tian aera. It appears, that in Egfrid's reign, it became a place of con&s;ider|able &s;trength and con&s;equence; he having cau&s;ed it to be rebuilt, and fortified with a wall.

MAG. 1745, p. 674.</NOTE> Camden &s;ays, <Q>in 619, Egfrid, King of Northumberland, gave it to the famous St. Cuthbert, in the&s;e words: <HI>I have likewi&s;e be&s;towed upon him the city called Luguballia, with the lands fifteen miles about it,</HI></Q> and quotes Symeon Dunelm. This is a palpable error, for Cuthbert's con&s;ecration was in 685. The words of Symeon are, <Q>Et quia illa terra minus &s;ufficiens erat, Lugubaliam que Luel vocatur, in circuita xv. miliaria habentum in augmentum &s;u&s;cepit; ubi etiam &s;anctimonialium congregatione &s;tabilita.

D. 686, a convent of monks, a &s;chool, and an abbey of nuns; but from Bede's Life of St. Cuthbert, cap. 27. it &s;eems as if the mona&s;tery here, to which Queen Emenburga retired, was in be|ing before St. Cuthbert's coming to Carli&s;le.</Q></P>
<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><P>"In the north-we&s;t corner of the Fore&s;t of Englewood, &s;tands the ancient city of Carli&s;le.

After the Danes had wa&s;ted the country with &s;ire and &s;word, William Rufus returning that way from Alnwick, when he had made peace with the King of Scotland, &s;eeing the place to be of &s;trength, convenient to entertain his forces at any time, again&s;t Scotland, commanded the &s;ame to be rectified, and to be fortified with walls and with a ca&s;tle. This was about the latter end of his reign, but he was prevented by an untimely death, before he could perform all that which he intended, for the good of the city: yet he placed there a colony of Dutchmen, which were &s;hortly thence tran&s;|lated into the I&s;le of Angle&s;ey, by him or his next &s;ucce&s;&s;or, Henry Beauclerk, his brother; and in&s;tead of them, a new regiment of &s;outhern men, of E&s;&s;ex, Kent, Middle&s;ex, and other parts of the realm, were brought to &s;upply their place, and to inhabit the counties of Northumberland and We&s;tmorland, under the leading of Ranulph de Me&s;chines, &s;i&s;ter's &s;on to Hugh Lupus, or Loup, fir&s;t Earl of Che&s;ter."</P>

<P><PB N="8" REF="10">After Egfrid's having re&s;tored the city, and fortified it with a wall, it became an appendage to the &s;ee of Lindisfarn, by the royal gift thereof to St. Cuthbert; and &s;o continued till the year 1130, when King Henry I. con&s;tituted it a &s;eparate bi&s;hoprick. By Dugdales Mona&s;ticon, it appears, that in 1082, in the acts of William Carilepho, bi&s;hop of Durham, it was &s;tiled part of the dioce&s;e of the bi&s;hop of Durham. It is a&s;&s;erted, that in 1066, William the Conqueror i&s;&s;ued his mandate to the inhabitants of Cumberland at large, and of Carli&s;le in particular, that they &s;hould continue &s;ubject to the bi&s;hop of Durham as their dioce&s;ian, from who&s;e predece&s;&s;ors they had received Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>So far we are allowed to &s;peak of this city from the loo&s;e records of antiquity; from the time of the Conque&s;t we have more certainty, and evidence of undenia|ble authenticity to guide us. Camden's de&s;cription of the &s;ite of Carli&s;le is to this purport, <Q>Between the confluence of the&s;e rivers (Peteril and Cauda) the ancient city of Carli&s;le has a delightful, plea&s;ant &s;ituation; bounded on the north with Eden, on the ea&s;t with Peteril, and on the we&s;t with Caude; and, be&s;ides the&s;e natural fences, it is fortified with a &s;trong &s;tone wall, a ca&s;tle, and citadel.

<PB N="11" REF="14"></NOTE> The cita|del,
<PB N="12" REF="15">as it is &s;aid, was erected in the reign of King Henry VIII.; and it is &s;urpri&s;|ing that the whole ca&s;tle and fortifications &s;hould &s;o &s;oon fall into &s;uch decay, as to be in the &s;tate repre&s;ented by that report, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth.

<PB N="13" REF="16">in thickne&s;s, an inward and outward ward; the walls of the outward ward, nine feet in thickne&s;s, and eighteen feet in height; and the walls of the inner ward, twelve feet, having a half-moon ba&s;tion. A tower, called the Captain's Tower. Two gates, one to each ward. In the ca&s;tle a great chamber and a hall, but no

But be&s;ides tho&s;e mentioned in the report, the walls were garni&s;hed with &s;everal &s;quare towers, particularly a tower at the we&s;tern &s;ally port, and a tower called the Tile Tower, of particular &s;trength.</P>
<P>Before we quit the &s;ubject of the ca&s;tle, we mu&s;t remark the beautiful and ex|ten&s;ive pro&s;pect which you command from the great tower. The foreground is formed of level meads, wa&s;hed by Eden; in one part, in&s;ulated by a &s;eparation of the river. This plot is ornamented by two fine &s;tone bridges, one of four, the other of nine arches, the great pa&s;&s;age towards Scotland. The hanging banks are crowded with the village and church of Stanwix, and the di&s;tant ground filled with the mountains of Bewca&s;tle. To the &s;outh, you command the plains to|wards Penrith, &s;hut in on either hand by a va&s;t chain of mountains; over which Cro&s;s-fell and Skiddaw are di&s;tinctly &s;een, greatly eminent. To the ea&s;t, a varied tract of cultivated country, &s;cattered over with villages and hamlets, mingling beautifully with woodlands on the exten&s;ive land&s;cape: the di&s;tant horizon form|ed by the heights of Northumberland.

The pre&s;ent edifice con&s;i&s;ts of the ea&s;t limb of the cro&s;s, being the chancel, and the cro&s;s aile or tran|&s;ept, with the tower: the greate&s;t part of the we&s;t limb of the cro&s;s, having been pulled down in the civil wars, 1641: with the materials they erected a guard|hou&s;e at every gate of the city, and one in the market-place; and two batteries in the ca&s;tle. The circular arches and ma&s;&s;ive round columns, <Q>who&s;e &s;hafts are only fourteen feet two inches high, and circumference full &s;even and a half,</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pennant.</NOTE> which remain of the we&s;t limb and tran&s;ept, are of the heavie&s;t order of the Saxon architecture; and at the fir&s;t &s;ight, te&s;tify the different ages in which this part and the chancel were erected: indeed the architecture denotes an earlier aera than the time of William Rufus, and probably here is a part of the work of the age of St. Cuthbert: but there is no corroborating evidence to attend the mode of building, which might prove &s;o ancient a date. The we&s;t end is &s;aid to have been, in length, 135 feet from the cro&s;s aile, of which 43 feet remains, it being di&s;membered of 92 feet. It is not in our power to determine how often this church was re&s;tored; it is evident that the Danes laid this city in a&s;hes, and that King William Rufus, under his tru&s;ty nominee Walter,
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Magna Bait. has it, that D. King of Scotland, built a great part of this cathedral.</NOTE> re&s;tored the city and the public buildings: but &s;o early as the reign of King Henry H. the city was laid wa&s;te by the Scots, and the public records were burnt, which mo&s;t probably, a|greeable to the cu&s;tom of tho&s;e days, were depo&s;ited in the archieves of the eccle|&s;ia&s;tics: conceiving this to be the fact, then we mu&s;t admit of &s;ome con&s;iderable change in this &s;acred edifice; for in 1292, we are told, an accidental fire con&s;um|ed the church, with half of the city, to the number of 1300 hou&s;es, as far as the north gate. In the reign of King Edward III. it was rebuilt by contributions. The editor of Camden's words are, <Q>Almo&s;t in the middle of the city, &s;tands the cathedral church; <HI>the upper part,</HI> whereof (being newer) is a curious piece of workman&s;hip, <HI>built by King Henry VIII.</HI> but the lower is much more ancient.&mdash; The lower we&s;t part is the parochial church, and as old as St. Cuthbert; or as Walter, who came in with the Conqueror, was a commander in his army, rebuilt the city, founded a priory, and turning religious, became, him&s;elf, the fir&s;t prior of it. The chancel was built by contributions, about the year 1350, and the belfrey was rai&s;ed, and the bells placed in it, at the charge of William de Strick|land, bi&s;hop in the year 1401.</Q> The expre&s;&s;ion u&s;ed by this learned editor, is &s;o indefinite, that we own we are not able to determine, whether he meant to imply that King Henry VIII, built the pre&s;ent chancel. By a writer in the

The&s;e contradictions and ambiguities, we are at pre&s;ent obliged to leave un&s;olved.</P>
<P>The choir is 137 feet in length, and, with the &s;ide ailes, 71 feet broad: the cro&s;s aile or tran&s;ept is 28 feet broad, &s;o that the length of the church, when entire, was exactly 300 feet within. The choir is of fine Gothic architecture, with light columns, remarkably beautiful. The &s;talls are garni&s;hed with taber|nacle work; (the organ is placed at the cro&s;s &s;creen, which contains but a narrow and low entrance, and is a great injury to this fine edifice.) By late repairs it is greatly embelli&s;hed, being wain&s;cotted with oak, from the &s;talls round the whole ea&s;t end of the choir, in a &s;imple &s;tile, after the old order. The open gates leading into the &s;ide ailes, are old and much broken, but &s;hew excellent light Tracery work, finely ornamented. The bi&s;hop's throne is not magnificent, but yet elegant and &s;tately. The breadth of the choir and ailes being 71 feet, corre&s;ponds well with the height, which to the center of the ceiling is 75 feet. The roof was originally lined or vaulted with wood, painted and orna|mented with arms and devices of the &s;everal patrons and contributors to the work; with the arms of France and England, were tho&s;e of the Piercys, Lucys, Warrens, and Mowbrays. The old wood lining remains in the cro&s;s aile, and &s;hews what was the former figure, and the ornaments of the choir: but the outward roof and wood ceiling of the choir having gone greatly to decay, when repairs were made, in 1764 the ceiling was &s;tuccoed, in the form of a groined vault, which is a great advantage to its appearance.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The whole expence amounted to 1300l. towards which, Dean Bolton contributed 50l.; Bi&s;hop Lyttleton 100l. and the Counte&s;s Dowager Gower, 200l.; the re&s;t was made up by the Dean and Chapter.</NOTE> The ea&s;t window is large, being 48 feet in height, and 30 in breadth, ornamented with fine pila&s;ters: but it has no ca&s;t of &s;olemnity, by means of a border of coloured gla&s;s thrown round it, of yellow, red, and green, which looks gaudy.
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>The official duties of marriages, chri&s;tenings, churchings, and funerals, are performed in the pari&s;h church, the ordinary duties of the Sabbath, and prayers twice a-day through the year in the choir. On the burial of any of the members of the choir, the corps is carried into that part of the church. The cathedral and pari&s;h church are both under one roof. It has a &s;tately &s;teeple with a ring of eight bells, which are rung on all public occa&s;ions. The con&s;i&s;tory or &s;piritual court is kept in part of the church. In the abbey, contiguous to the church, and in which properly the church &s;tands, are &s;everal venerable buildings, &s;uch as the deanry, &s;ratery, head &s;chool, cloi&s;ters, porter's lodge, &amp;c.&mdash;L.</P></NOTE></P>

<P>The door with its ornaments, on the &s;outh &s;ide of the choir, near the bi&s;hop's throne; and al&s;o the throne was the work of Prior Haythwaite, about the year 1480, his name having been on the back&s;ide of it: and the oppo&s;ite door with its ornaments, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been erected by Prior Senhou&s;e, about the year 1500, by the &s;entence in&s;cribed thereon, <HI>"Vulnera quinque dei &s;int medicina mei,"</HI> which was that prior's common adage. The tabernacle work in the quire was done at the expence of Bi&s;hop Strickland, who came to the &s;ee, A. D. 1400.</P>
<P>There were two chapels, and two chantries, founded within this church; the chapel of St. Catharine was founded by John de Capella, a citizen of Carli&s;le, which he endowed with certain burgage hou&s;es, &s;ome lands and rents. In 1366, there being an unju&s;t detention of the rights of this chapel, Bi&s;hop Appleby gave notice for re&s;titution in ten days, under pain of excommunication by bell, book, and candle. This chapel was on the &s;outh &s;ide of the church.</P>
<P>The chapel of St. Alban in 1356, was on inquiry, found not to have been con|&s;ecrated, and thenceforth divine offices and &s;epulture were prohibited to be longer performed therein: this appears by an entry in Bi&s;hop Welton's regi&s;ter. On the di&s;&s;olution, King Edward VI. granted the lands and tenements appertaining to this chantry, unto Thomas Dal&s;ton and William Denton.</P>
<P>Bi&s;hop Whelpdale founded a chantry, and endowed it with 200l. for holy offices, for the &s;ouls of Sir Thomas Skelton, Knt. and Mr. John Gla&s;ton.</P>
<P>There was a chantry of the holy cro&s;s, but who was the founder, and when it was endowed, is not known; King Edward VI. granted the lands and tenements thereto belonging, in Carli&s;le and Kirklinton, to Hen. Tanner and Tho. Bucher.

<PB N="23" REF="29">founded another at Ain&s;taplighe, endowing the &s;ame with other revenues there. King Henry I. founded a college of &s;ecular prie&s;ts in the &s;econd year of his reign, and made Athwald his confe&s;&s;or or chaplain, (prior of St. Botophs) fir&s;t prior of Carli&s;le, dedicating the church to the honour of the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin Mary, and endowed them with the tithes of the churches then founded in the Fore&s;t of Englewood; but being hindred by the tumults and troubles of his time, he could not perfect all things before the 33d year of his reign, and then &s;trucken with grief for the lo&s;s of his children, that were drowned coming from Normandy, by the coun&s;el of the Prior Athelwold; and to appea&s;e God for his &s;ins, as he thought, he erected a bi&s;hop's &s;ee at Carli&s;le, and made the &s;aid Athelwald, fir&s;t bi&s;hop thereof, whom the Archbi&s;hop of York named Thur&s;tan, did con&s;ecrate in the year 1133: and in his &s;tead, another chaplain of the &s;aid King Henry, named Walter, was made the &s;econd prior of that hou&s;e, who, a little before his election, had taken upon him, by the king's licen&s;e, a religious habit, viz. of a regular canon there, which order of canons the king and bi&s;hop Athelwold had placed in that hou&s;e, bani&s;hing the &s;ecular prie&s;ts immediately upon his con&s;ecration. The &s;aid Walter gave to the church of Carli&s;le for ever in pure alms, his lands in Lyn&s;tock, Richardby, Cro&s;by, Little Cro&s;by, Walby, Brun&s;keugh, Carleton, Little Carleton, and the wood; and the churches or rectories of St. Cuthbert in Carli&s;le and Staynwings, which the king had given him; and the &s;ame gift was confirmed unto them both by the king and bi&s;hop Athelwold.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The rectory of St. Cuthbert's in Carli&s;le, was founded by the former inhabi|tants of Carli&s;le before the Danes overthrew the city, and by them dedicated to the honour of St. Cuthbert of Dure&s;m, who of antient times was lord of the &s;ame for fifteen miles about Carli&s;le. At the fir&s;t foundation of the church every citi|zen offered a piece of money, which was a coin of bra&s;s then current, which they buried under the foundation of the church &s;teeple there as was found to be true at the late re-edifying of St. Cuthbert's &s;teeple, A. D. ****, for when they took up the foundation of the old &s;teeple, they found well near a bu&s;hel of that money.</Q></P>
<P><Q>After the &s;aid priors, Athelwold and Walter, &s;ucceeded John, who gave Water|croft in Flimby, to the Lord of Workington, &s;on of Go&s;patrick; and after John, Bartholomew, who, in the time of Bi&s;hop Hugh, confirmed Orton in We&s;tmor|land to the prior of Coney&s;head.

<PB N="25" REF="31">probable it was a concealed trea&s;ure, intended to be &s;ecured again&s;t the Danes, or &s;ome other ravagers: for when the foundations were making for the pre&s;ent new edifice, and the workmen had gone below the foundations of the old church, they di&s;covered the remains of a &s;till more ancient erection, and took up &s;everal pieces of broken &s;culpture; among the re&s;t the figure of a nun with her veil or hood, well cut and in good pre&s;ervation, which we &s;aw in the garden of George Moun&s;ey, E&s;q. of Carli&s;le; &s;o that it &s;hould &s;eem the old nunnery &s;tood there.
<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><P>This &s;culpture is now lo&s;t.&mdash;In Mr. Moun&s;ey's, and other gardens adjoining, many foundations of hou&s;es, fragments of pottery, quantities of oak-wood, human bones, &amp;c. have been dug up at various times. This ground is upon the ea&s;t &s;ide of Engli&s;h &s;treet, and called the Grey-Friars; and up the we&s;t &s;ide, adjoining the walls, from St. Cuthbert's church to the jail, is called the Black-Friars; and &s;imilar things have been dug up here al&s;o: a few years ago, in making a drain from a hou&s;e here towards the walls, the top of an arch was di&s;cerned; &s;ome of the &s;tones being removed, we di&s;covered a &s;pacious arched room, one &s;ide of which re&s;ted upon the walls, in height 15 feet, in breadth 12 feet, and in length about 30 feet; the end was narrower and lower, and &s;uppo&s;ed to have been connected with other &s;imilar rooms, but the partitions built up. There were four funnels went upright to the foot-path of the walls, but covered at the top with &s;lags, and iron grates in the funnels. On the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, between two of the arches, a horizontal funnel, about two feet wide and three feet high, went towards the city: this was &s;earched a con&s;iderable way, till the per&s;on was entangled with rubbi&s;h which choaked it up: beneath this pa&s;&s;age, the floor was flagged and walled in about 18 inches high on each &s;ide, and a conduit went through the city walls on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the vault; this was opened by removing the earth on the out &s;ide, about four feet deep, and let out a great quantity of water which was lodged in the vault. Proceeding to remove the wet rubbi&s;h which was collected, the workmen were interrupted by the gunner of the ca&s;tle, who a&s;&s;umed a higher power than Mr. Mead, the &s;tore keeper, at who&s;e in&s;tance the &s;earch was making; and the place was immediately &s;hut up and never &s;ince opened.

<P>Walter, the Norman, laid the foundation of the priory, which he dedicated to the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin: it is &s;aid he became the head of the &s;ociety which he had in|&s;tituted; but authors of great authenticity, &s;peak of his work as being incomplete at the time of his death; and that King Henry I. in the &s;econd year of his reign, took it under his patronage, fini&s;hed it, and endowed it, A. D. 1101, and therein placed regular canons of the order of St. Augu&s;tine, appointing Athelwald his confe&s;&s;or and chaplain the fir&s;t prior. Notwith&s;tanding Denton's account, we are convinced there was a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of thirty priors after Athelwald, before the time of the di&s;&s;olution. Athelwald afterwards being made bi&s;hop of this dioce&s;e, was &s;ucceeded in the priory by Walter, another chaplain of the kings', who had taken upon him the regular habit; and being a rigorous di&s;ciplinarian, he bani&s;hed all

<P>was in&s;tituted and founded by King Henry I. in the year 1133, two and thirty years after the foundation of the priory. By the gift of Egfrid, Carli&s;le became
<PB N="30" REF="36">a member of the &s;ee of Lindisfarne, and followed the tran&s;lation of that bi&s;hoprick to Che&s;ter, and finally to Durham. The cau&s;e alledged for di&s;membering Carli&s;le, and con&s;tituting there a &s;eparate &s;ee, was on account of the di&s;tance from Durham,
<PB N="31" REF="37">then the &s;eat of the epi&s;copacy, and the con&s;equential delays of epi&s;copal duties there. According to Camden, the monks of Durham looked upon this act of the
<PB N="32" REF="38">&s;overeign, as a grievous infringement of their ancient rights and privileges; but from the abject di&s;po&s;ition of mind, peculiar to that age, they avoided pointing
<PB N="33" REF="39">the accu&s;ation where it was due, and alledged that <Q>when Ralph, bi&s;hop of Dur|ham was bani&s;hed, and the church had none to protect it, certain bi&s;hops joined

<P><PB N="35" REF="41">King Henry con&s;tituted Ethelwald, or as he is &s;ome times called, Adeluph, then prior there, the fir&s;t bi&s;hop of this new &s;ee: and the church of St. Mary then became a cathedral church.</P>

<P>IN the di&s;tant age in which the fir&s;t Bi&s;hop of Carli&s;le aro&s;e, little can be gathered of the virtues of memorable actions of men, though even thus eminent: this ob&s;curity is greate&s;t in a country which was almo&s;t a con&s;tant &s;cene of military exploits, depredations, and blood&s;hed. Carli&s;le, though a chief barrier again&s;t the Scots, &s;uffered many changes of fortune, and the life of its bi&s;hop was frequently di&s;turbed and full of trouble. From &s;uch cau&s;es, there is but little hi&s;toric matter handed down to us, per&s;onally rela|tive
<PB N="37" REF="43">to this prelate, and &s;everal of his immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. We find him indeed bu&s;y in one eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal matter, in which he was immediately adver&s;ary to the will of his &s;overeign. He was one of the electors of Henry Murdac, abbot of Fountanis to be archbi&s;hop of York. The king's di&s;plea&s;ure was &s;uch at this tran&s;action, that he denounced vengeance again&s;t all tho&s;e who were concerned in it: but &s;uch was this prelate's contempt of the &s;overeign's menaces and &s;elf-confidence, that he received Murdac as his metropolitan, when he came to vi&s;it David King of Scotland, then re&s;ident in this city.

<HEAD>EPISCOPUS II.</HEAD>
<P>BERNARD, of whom we know little but his epi&s;copal acts.&mdash;In 1169, he dedicated the church of St. Mary Magdalene of Lanerco&s;t. He remained bi&s;hop of Carli&s;le to the time of his death, which hap|pened, A. D. 1186. From the long continued vacancy of the &s;ee, it appears evidently, that it was in a &s;ad un&s;ettled &s;tate, and full of di&s;cord and troubles, as well as meanly revenued; for, by the regi&s;ter of Wetheral, it is &s;hewn that King Henry II. being pre&s;ent at Carli&s;le, tendered the bi&s;hoprick to Paulinus de Leedes, and (as &s;uch was even an early influence in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs) offered to augment the income with 300 marks out of the churches of Bambrough and Scarbrough, with the chapel of Tick|hill, and two manors adjacent to Carli&s;le: but even with &s;uch augmentations Paulinus refu&s;ed it.
<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><P>In 1188, the temporalties continuing in the king's hand, the following particulars, among&s;t others, were brought into account at the trea&s;ury: for oil for the &s;acrament at Ea&s;ter two terms, and carrying the &s;ame from London to Car|li&s;le, 14l. In work of the greater altarand avement in the church of St. Mary, Carli&s;le, 27s. 9d. In work of dormi|tory of the canons, 22l. 19s. 2d.</P></NOTE> It continued vacant to the beginning of the 13th century, and King John gave the revenues of the bi&s;hop|rick to &s;upport the archbi&s;hop of Sclavonia. In 1203, the Pope intermeddled with the income of the &s;ee, granting it to the archbi&s;hop of Regula, who was obliged to abandon his own, and was de&s;titute of &s;upport. This act of the papal authority was confirmed by the king. The continued vacancy let in a flood of enormities among the religious here. The canons publickly announced their contempt of the papal authority, and the cen&s;ures of his legate: in defiance of all the interdicts and &s;entences denounced to the contrary, they per&s;i&s;ted in celebrating divine &s;ervices, and all holy offices of the &s;acraments: but their arrogance and impropieties did not cea&s;e there; they &s;wore fealty to the king of Scots, an avowed enemy to the crown of England, and one in open oppo&s;ition to the authority of the holy &s;ee. In con&s;e|quence of the&s;e licentious acts, they &s;et up an interdicted and excommunicated clerk for their bi&s;hop, con|trary to the will of their lawful &s;overeign, and the pope's legate; and &s;eizing the revenues of the bi&s;hoprick, applied them according to their own will. Enormities like the&s;e were to be corrected with the &s;evere&s;t mea&s;ures. The council of King Henry III. applied to Pope Honorius III. totally to remove the&s;e offen&s;ive canons, and place prebends in their room; to augment the revenues of the &s;ee, which were &s;o &s;mall that no able and loyal per&s;on would accept of the bi&s;hoprick, and to di&s;place the per&s;on who had

<P>"The Cornu Eburneum they have yet in the cathedral of Carli&s;le, a &s;ymbol, very probably, of &s;ome of King Henry I's grants to the priory; but in none of tho&s;e grants, of which any copy is now extant, do tho&s;e tythes appear. The cere|mony of inve&s;titure with a horn, or other like &s;ymbol, is very ancient, and was in u&s;e before there were any written charters. We read of Ulf a Dani&s;h prince, who gave all his lands to the church of York, and the form of the endow|ment was this; he brought the horn out of which he u&s;ually drank, and before the high altar, kneeling devoutly, drank the wine, and by that ceremony enfeo&s;&s;ed the church with all his lands and revenues.</P>
<P>King Canute, another Dane, gave lands at Pu&s;ey in Berk&s;hire, to the family of that name there, with a horn &s;olemnly delivered as a confirmation of the grant; which horn, it is &s;aid, is &s;till there to be &s;een.</P>
<P>So King Edward the confe&s;&s;or, granted to Nigel the hunt&s;man, an hide of land, called Derehide; and a wood, called Halewood, with the cu&s;tody of the fore&s;t of Bernewood, to hold of the king, to him and his heirs, by one horn, which is the charter of the &s;aid fore&s;t.</P>
<P>So that, not the Danes only, but the Engli&s;h Saxons al&s;o, were acquainted with this ancient cu&s;tom. Thus Ingulphus, abbot of Crowland, who lived in the time of William the Conqueror, acquaints us that it continued down to his time. He tells us that many e&s;tates were granted by word only, without writing, as by delivery of a &s;word, an helmet, a horn or cup, or &s;uch like; but this mode, he &s;ays, in after times was changed.</P>
<P>Ulf's horn at York, when the reformation began in King Edward the VI's. time, was &s;wept away among&s;t other co&s;tly ornaments, and &s;old to a gold&s;mith, who took away from it the tippings of gold wherewith it was adorned, and the gold chain which was affixed to it. fAfter which time the horn it&s;elf, out in ivory, of an Octagon form, came into the hands of General Fairfax; who being a lover of antiquities, pre&s;erved it during the confu&s;ions of the civil wars; who&s;e memory is de&s;ervedly honoured for other generous actions of this nature; &s;uch as allowing Mr. Dod&s;worth, the antiquarian, a yearly &s;alary to pre&s;erve the in&s;criptions in churches, the giving his valuable manu&s;cripts to the univer&s;ity of Oxford, and his pre&s;erving the public library there, as he did the cathedral at York from being &s;poiled and defaced after the &s;urrender of the city. And he dying in 1671, this horn came into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his next kin&s;man, Lord Fairfax, who ornamented it anew, and re&s;tored it to its ancient repo&s;itory, where it now remains a noble monument of modern as well as ancient piety.&mdash;ARCUAEOLOGIA, 168.</P></NOTE> but the grants given in evidence not extending to &s;uch tythes, either expre&s;sly or by im|plication, the right was adjudged to the king, and he afterwards granted the &s;ame to the prior and convent, as before-mentioned.</P>

<P>ROBERT ALDRIDGE &s;ucceeded to the &s;ee, A. D. 1537. As he lived in a bu&s;y age, and was pre&s;ent to many great changes in church and &s;tate, one &s;hould expect from a man of &s;o great a character, as to his learning, one whom Era&s;mus called in his early years, "blanda eloquentiae Juvenis," a poet and ora|tor of more than ordinary note, that he would have been a &s;hining figure in the multiform bu&s;ine&s;s of this part of Henry's reign: but we may judge from his con&s;tantly holding the appointments he had, that he temporized with the vereing mea&s;ures of the prince; and like the notorious, though perhaps, imagi|nary character of the vicar of Bray, &s;till keeping the &s;addle, let the object of the pur&s;uit be what it might. The &s;ervility that &s;trikes the idea, when one conceives &s;uch a character, in the time of this monarch, in|in&s;pires aver&s;ion. It may be a har&s;h &s;entence, but it proceeds from a fact, that produces large and na|tural inferences. Let us attend to his progre&s;s in life. Buckingham&s;hire was the place of his birth, and
<PB N="47" REF="53">he received his education at Eaton, till the year 1507, when he was appointed a &s;cholar of King's col|lege, Cambridge. He was once proctor of that univer&s;ity; and from thence he became ma&s;ter, fellow, and provo&s;t of Eaton. About the year 1529, he was made bachelor of divinity at Oxford, and the fol|lowing year took up his doctor's degree. Soon after, he was appointed archdeacon of Colche&s;ter; and in the year 1537, was in&s;talled a canon at Wind&s;or, and made regi&s;ter of the order of the garter. He was an oppo&s;er of Cranmer, and adhered to the Romi&s;h profe&s;&s;ion of faith; indeed, in the work called the Bi&s;hop's Book, containing the godly and pious in&s;titution of a chri&s;tian, it is &s;aid he joined with that archbi&s;hop; but touching the doctrine of the &s;even &s;acraments, his opinion was immediately oppo&s;ite: and he promoted the act of 31&s;t King Henry VIII. touching the &s;ix articles, contrary to every effort of Cranmer.&mdash;He departed this life, 1555, and was &s;ucceeded by</P>

<P>OWEN OGLETHORP; who, by the incon&s;i&s;tencies in his public actions, &s;eems to have been a very weak man. He received the temporalties of this bi&s;hoprick in the month of October, in the year 1556; but the pope's confirmatory bull did not arrive till the month of January following. He was born at a &s;mall village, near Tadca&s;ter, in the county of York, of inferior parents, and had his education in Magdalene College, Oxford. In the year 1531, he was proctor of the univer&s;ity, and &s;oon after was entered bache|lor of divinity. In the year 1535, he was cho&s;en pre&s;ident of the college; and in 1551, had the di&s;tin|gui&s;hed office of vice chancellor. He was made a canon, and &s;oon after dean, of the royal chapel at Wind&s;or; and in the fir&s;t year of Queen Mary's reign, he was appointed &s;ecretary to the order of the garter: this was a year of great honour to him, for in it he held the pre&s;idency of Magdalene College, the rectories of Newington and Ha&s;&s;ely, in Oxford&s;hire; together with the deanry of Wind&s;or. In 1554, he was one of the appointed di&s;putants in the controver&s;y with Cranmer, Latimer, and Rydley; and &s;hewed him&s;elf a mo&s;t inveterate adver&s;ary to the principles of reformation, and even to that humane rule, toleration. In 1558, we &s;ee him acting in the incon&s;i&s;tent character I intimated; for, during the vacancy of the &s;ee of Canterbury, when all the bi&s;hops had refu&s;ed to officiate in the coronation of Queen Elizabeth: he only, the lowe&s;t of the tribe, the bittere&s;t in the mea&s;ures again&s;t reformi&s;ts, and the inte|re&s;ts of the prote&s;tant church; he only could be found to place the crown on the head of that illu&s;trious prince&s;s: the lords of the council, willing that the ceremony &s;hould have every outward dignity, &s;ent for all the pontifical robes, and en&s;igns of high office, u&s;ed by the archbi&s;hop on that &s;olemn occa&s;ion, that our prelate might be duely habited for the occa&s;ion. It is not to be reconciled, how Oglethorpe could be influenced to this office; the character of the prince&s;s, and her &s;entiments in religious matter, were no &s;ecrets; and the bi&s;hop's faith and &s;entiments were publicly avouched: the incon&s;i&s;tency is not to be reconciled, but by the di&s;covery of tho&s;e influences and private &s;prings of the &s;tate, which are long &s;ince locked up in the impenetrable regions of oblivion. How mu&s;t he have been &s;hocked and confounded, whil&s;t the ceremony was performing, by the command of the queen not to elevate the con&s;ecrated ho&s;t, in the celebration of ma&s;s, u&s;ual in this &s;olemnity, "<HI>becau&s;e &s;he liked it not.</HI> Wood, with a voice of commi&s;eration, would palliate the error with his pity: <Q>For the fact, when he &s;aw the i&s;&s;ue of the mat|ter, and both him&s;elf and the whole tribe of his &s;ecret order deprived, the churches holy laws, and faith again&s;t the conditions of her con&s;ecration, and acception into that royal office violated, he fore repented him all the days of his life, which were, for that &s;pecial cau&s;e, both &s;hort and weari&s;ome.</Q></P>
<P>In the fir&s;t parliament he gave his vote again&s;t the bills for re&s;titution of fir&s;t fruits, for re&s;toring the &s;upremacy, exchange of bi&s;hops lands, and uniformity of the common prayer. He would willingly, by his adherence to his old partizans, have recovered a reputation he had lo&s;t, by being a tool to the pre|vailing party; and, by his un&s;teadine&s;s, he dropt to the ground between the two. The council fined him 250l. for non-attendance at Sewel's challenge in di&s;putation, A. D. 1559, as her maje&s;ty had commanded; and &s;hortly after he was deprived of his bi&s;hoprick, worth 268l.</P>
<P>His death was &s;udden, but the cau&s;e uncertain; the popular report was, that it happened in an apo|plexy. He was privately buried at St. Dun&s;tan's in the we&s;t. By his will, he ordered the foundation of a &s;chool and ho&s;pital, at Tadca&s;ter, with an ample endowment.</P>

The un&s;ettled and turbu|lent e&s;tate of the north was &s;uch, that he was obliged to have a commi&s;&s;ion to arm him&s;elf and depen|dants within his bi&s;hoprick, again&s;t the tumultuous and enraged populace.

<P>RICHARD BARNES was his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. From this period of time, the bu&s;ine&s;s and importance of bi&s;hops in &s;ecular affairs declined: in their &s;piritual powers they were &s;o reduced, that only within their re&s;pec|tive bi&s;hopricks, they held the authorities con&s;i&s;tent with the ancient rules of the common law, without the &s;uperlative aid of the &s;ee of Rome; &s;o that, from this aera the hi&s;tory of our prelates becomes little more than per&s;onal. Bi&s;hop Barnes was born in the county of Lanca&s;ter, and educated in Brazen No&s;e College, Oxford, where he took a degree of ma&s;ter of arts, and was elected a fellow.

He was, by birth, an Iri&s;hman, and had his education in the univer&s;ity of Dublin. He was promoted to the bi&s;hop|rick of Meath in 1620, and four years afterwards was advanced to the archbi&s;hoprick. With difficulty, and a par&s;imonious hand, he &s;ub&s;i&s;ted on the revenues of our &s;ee, dimini&s;hed and exhau&s;ted as they were by the armies of England and Scotland, alternately quartering in this county; at length the &s;eizure which was made by parliament on all the lands of bi&s;hops, brought him to great di&s;tre&s;s. In con&s;ideration of his eminent character, his learning and virtuous zeal, he had a pen&s;ion of 400l. a-year granted to him, by parliamentary order, but it was paid very ill, in&s;omuch that he never received it above once or twice.</P>

<P>EDWARD RAINBOW came to the &s;ee in 1664. He was born at Bilton in the county of Lincoln, 1608, being the &s;on of the pari&s;h prie&s;t there. He was educated at We&s;tmin&s;ter &s;chool, and was a &s;tudent in Corpus Chri&s;ti College Oxford. He obtained a fellow&s;hip in Magdalen College Cambridge, where he was tutor to &s;everal eminent pupils, among whom were the &s;ons of lords, Suffolk and Dain|court. In the year 1642, he was elected ma&s;ter of Magdalen, and took his degree of doctor of divinity: but he was &s;oon after deprived of his ma&s;ter&s;hip for refu&s;ing to &s;ign a prote&s;tation again&s;t the king. In 1652, he obtained the living of Che&s;terfield in E&s;&s;ex; and in 1659, the Earl of Warwick pre&s;ented him to the valuable living of Benefield, in the county of Northampton. He was re&s;tored to his ma&s;ter|&s;hip and made dean of Peterborough &s;oon after K. Charles's re&s;toration, and in the year 1662, he was made vice-chancellor of the univer&s;ity of Cambridge.

<P>THOMAS SMITH born at Whitewall, in We&s;tmorland. He had his education at Appleby free &s;chool, and was a &s;tudent in Queen's College Oxford. He was a man, though deeply read in the learning of his age, of con&s;ummate mode&s;ty, and humble expectations. In the early part of life, in the univer&s;ity he had the degree of ma&s;ter of arts and held a fellow&s;hip. He was a well reputed tutor, and had many eminent pupils. Whil&s;t the king was re&s;ident at Oxford, he was appointed preacher at Chri&s;t-church; and at St. Mary's, he preached before the Parliament. In the &s;ucceeding confu&s;ions in church and &s;tate, he retired to the north and lived in great privacy. On the re&s;toration he was created bachelor of divinity, and &s;oon after, by diploma, had a doctor's degree given him by the univer&s;ity of Oxford.</P>
<P>He was one of tho&s;e who were fortunate enough to be in the &s;overeign's remembrance, for (multitudes were neglected) and was made one of his chaplains in ordinary: in November, 1660, he was nominated to a prebend in this church. A prebend in the cathedral of Durham, in a few months, was offered to him by bi&s;hop Co&s;ins, and there he had conceived his preferments in the church were to re&s;t; for at a con&s;iderable expence he repaired the hou&s;e in the college at Durham, in a manner con&s;i&s;tent with an idea that it would be the place of his re&s;idence for life.</P>
<P>In 1671, he was appointed dean of Carli&s;le, and in 1684, on the recommendation of K. Charles, he was elected to this &s;ee. He died at Ro&s;e-Ca&s;tle, on the 12th of April, 1702, and was buried in this cathedral.
<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><P>The dean's hou&s;e was left by his predece&s;&s;or in the &s;ame ruinous condition the rebellious times had brought it into; but was now mo&s;tly, from the ground, built at his own expence.</P>

<P>WILLIAM NICHOLSON, his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, was born at Orton near Carli&s;le, being the &s;on of the rector of that pari&s;h. He was a &s;tudent in Queen's college Oxford, where in 1678, having taken the degree of ma&s;ter of arts, he was elected to a fellow&s;hip. In 1681, he was made a prebendary of this church by bi&s;hop Rainbow, and had the vicarage of Torpenhow: and in the year following he was made arch|deacon of Carli&s;le. In the year 1702, he was con&s;ecrated, at Lambeth, bi&s;hop of this &s;ee; a promotion &s;aid to be obtained by the intere&s;t of the Mu&s;graves of Edenhall: an a&s;&s;ertion injurious to his great learning, his high merit, and connections in life, from whence his promotion was derived.</P>
<P>He found &s;ome difficulties from the imperfection of the in&s;truments, in granting in&s;titution to doctor Francis Atterbury, to the deanry of Carli&s;le; which by the queen's &s;pecial command were obviated: but it is probable this imbittered their minds again&s;t each other, for on the bi&s;hop's interpo&s;ition as vi&s;itor under the &s;tatute of K. Henry VIII, for appea&s;ing certain conte&s;ts which had ari&s;en between the dean and the chapter; at the dean's in&s;tigation, doctor Todd prote&s;ted again&s;t his right of vi&s;itation, in&s;i&s;ting on the invalidity of that &s;tatute, and that in the crown only was ve&s;ted that privilege:
<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">There was an early grudge between them; for Dr. Attorbury had written again&s;t our bi&s;hop's Engli&s;h Hi&s;torical Library, touching convocations.</NOTE> things run &s;o high that Todd was &s;u&s;pended and excommunicated, and the di&s;pute produced &s;uch &s;erious con&s;equences, as to promote a law for confirming the &s;tatute of K. Henry VIII. In the year 1715, he was made Lord Almoner; in 1718, was tran&s;lated to Londonderry, in Ireland, and died &s;uddenly, 1726, before his removal to the archbi&s;hoprick of Ca&s;hell, for which tran&s;lation the in&s;truments were made out.</P>
<P>He was a celebrated writer, in his works di&s;covering an excellent and almo&s;t univer&s;al genius. In the year 1678, the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, Sir Jo&s;eph William&s;on, &s;ent him to Leip&s;ic to acquire a know|ledge of the Dutch and other continental languages. At the in&s;tance of the profe&s;&s;or there, he tran&s;lated out of the Engli&s;h into Latin, Hook's E&s;&s;ay on the Motion of the Earth from the Sun's Parallax. In the year 1680, he publi&s;hed the three fir&s;t volumes of the Engli&s;h Atlas, comprehending an account of Poland, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, and Germany. In the year 1685, he wrote two &s;hort accounts of the in&s;criptions on the Bewca&s;tle monument, and font at Bridekirk in this county; publi&s;hed in the philo&s;ophical tran&s;actions. In 1696 he publi&s;hed the fir&s;t part of his Engli&s;h hi&s;torical library, the &s;econd part appearing the next year; and in 1699 it was completed in the third part. In 1702 he
<PB N="53" REF="59">publi&s;hed one for Scotland, and in 1724 one al&s;o for Ireland. In 1705 he publi&s;hed the Border Laws. In 1713 he wrote a preface to doctor Chamberlain's book on the Lord's prayer. In 1717 were pub|li&s;hed in octavo, a collection of papers which had appeared in the Daily Courant, and other periodical prints. In 1719 he wrote a preface to the third edition of doctor Wilkin's Leges Anglo-Saxonicae.

<P>EDMUND LAW, D. D. &s;ucceeded to the &s;ee in 1768.&mdash;He was born in the pari&s;h of Cartmel in Lanca|&s;hire, in the year 1703. His father, who was a clergyman, held a &s;mall chapel in that neighbourhood; but the family had been &s;ituated at A&s;kham, in the county of We&s;tmorland. He was educated for &s;ome time at Cartmel &s;chool, afterwards at the free grammar-&s;chool at Kendal; from which he went, very well in|&s;tructed in the learning of grammar &s;chools, to St. John's College in Cambridge.</P>
<P>Soon after taking his fir&s;t degree, he was elected fellow of Chri&s;t's College in that univer&s;ity. During his re&s;idence in which college, he became known to the public by a tran&s;lation of Archbi&s;hop King's E&s;&s;ay upon the Origin of Evil, with copious notes; in which many metaphy&s;ical &s;ubjects, curious and intere&s;ting in their own nature, are treated of with great ingenuity, learning, and novelty. To this work was prefixed, under the name of a Preliminary Di&s;&s;ertation, a very valuable piece, written by the Rev. Mr. Gay of Sidney College. Our bi&s;hop always &s;poke of this gentleman in terms of the greate&s;t re&s;pect. In the Bible, and in the writings of Mr. Locke, no man, he u&s;ed to &s;ay, was &s;o well ver&s;ed.</P>
<P>He al&s;o, whil&s;t at Chri&s;t-College, undertook and went through a very laborious part, in preparing for the pre&s;s, an edition of Stephen's The&s;aurus. His acquaintance, during his fir&s;t re&s;idence in the univer|&s;ity, was principally with Dr. Waterland, the learned ma&s;ter of Magdalen College; Dr. Jortin, a name known to every &s;cholar; and Dr. Taylor, the editor of Demo&s;thenes.</P>
<P>In the year 1737, he was pre&s;ented by the univer&s;ity to the living of Gray&s;tock, in the county of Cumberland, a rectory of about 300l. a year. The advow&s;on of this benefice belonged to the family of Howards of Gray&s;tock, but devolved to the univer&s;ity for this turn, by virtue of an act of parliament, which transfers to the&s;e two bodies the nomination to &s;uch benefices as appertain, at the time of the vacancy, to the patronage of a Roman Catholic. The right, however, of the univer&s;ity was conte&s;ted; and it was not till after a law-&s;uit of two years continuance, that Mr. Law was &s;ettled in his living. Soon after this, he married Mary, the daughter of John Chri&s;tian, E&s;q. of Unerigg, in the county of Cumberland; a lady, who&s;e character is remembered with tenderne&s;s and e&s;teem by all who knew her.</P>
<P>In 1743, he was promoted by Sir George Fleming, bi&s;hop of Carli&s;le, to the archdeaconry of that dioce&s;e; and in 1746, went from Gray&s;tock to re&s;ide at Salkeld, a plea&s;ant village upon the banks of the river Eden, the rectory of which is annexed to the archdeaconry. Mr. Law was not one of tho&s;e who lo&s;e and forget them&s;elves in the country. During his re&s;idence at Salkeld, he publi&s;hed Con&s;iderations on the Theory of Religion: to which were &s;ubjoined, Reflections on the Life and Character of Chri&s;t; and an appendix concerning the u&s;e of the words Soul and Spirit in holy Scripture, and the &s;tate of the dead there de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Dr. Keene held at this time, with the bi&s;hoprick of Che&s;ter, the ma&s;ter&s;hip of Peterhou&s;e in Cambridge. De&s;iring to leave the univer&s;ity, he procured Dr. Law to be elected to &s;ucceed him in that &s;tation. This took place in the year 1756; in which year Dr. Law re&s;igned his archdeaconry in favour of Mr. Eyre, a brother-in-law of Dr. Keene. Two years before this, he had proceeded to his degree of doctor in divinity; in his public exerci&s;e for which, he defended the doctrine of what is u&s;ually called the "&s;leep of the &s;oul."</P>
<P>About the year 1760, he was appointed head librarian of the univer&s;ity; a &s;ituation which, as it pro|cured an ea&s;y and quick acce&s;s to books, was peculiarly agreeable to his ta&s;te and habits. Some time
<PB N="55" REF="61">after this, he was al&s;o appointed ca&s;ui&s;tical profe&s;&s;or. In the year 1762, he &s;uffered an irreparable lo&s;s by the death of his wife; a lo&s;s in it&s;elf every way afflicting, and rendered more &s;o by the &s;ituation of his family, which then con&s;i&s;ted of eleven children, many of them very young. Some years afterwards, he received &s;everal preferments, which were rather honourable expre&s;&s;ions of regard from his friends, than of much advantage to his fortune.</P>
<P>By Dr. Cornwallis, then bi&s;hop of Litchfield, afterwards archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, who had been his pupil at Chri&s;t College, he was appointed to the archdeaconry of Stafford&s;hire, and to a prebend in the church of Litchfield. By his old acquaintance, Dr. Green, bi&s;hop of Lincoln, he was made a prebendary of that church. But in the year 1767, by the intervention of the duke of Newca&s;tle, to who&s;e intere&s;t, in the memorable conte&s;t for the high &s;teward&s;hip of the univer&s;ity, he had adhered in oppo&s;ition to &s;ome temptations, he obtained a &s;tall in the church of Durham. The year after this, the duke of Grafton, who had a &s;hort time before been elected chancellor of the univer&s;ity, recommended the ma&s;ter of Peter|hou&s;e to his maje&s;ty for the bi&s;hoprick of Carli&s;le. This recommendation was made, not only without &s;olicitation on his part or that of his friends, but without his knowledge, until the duke's intention in his favour was &s;ignified to him by the archbi&s;hop.</P>
<P>In or about the year 1777, our bi&s;hop gave to the public a hand&s;ome edition, in three volumes quarto, of the Works of Mr. Locke, with a Life of the Author, and a preface. Mr. Locke's writings and cha|racter he held in the highe&s;t e&s;teem, and &s;eems to have drawn from them many of his own principles: he was a di&s;ciple of that &s;chool. About the &s;ame time he publi&s;hed a tract, which engaged &s;ome atten|tion in the controver&s;y concerning &s;ub&s;cription; and he publi&s;hed new editions of his two principal works, with con&s;iderable additions, and &s;ome alterations. Be&s;ides the works already mentioned, he publi&s;hed, in 1734, or 1735, a very ingenious <HI>Inquiry into the Ideas of Space, Time,</HI> &amp;c. in which he combats the opinions of Dr. Clarke and his adherents on the&s;e &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>Dr. Law held the &s;ee of Carli&s;le almo&s;t nineteen years; during which time he twice, only, omitted &s;pending the &s;ummer months in his dioce&s;e at the bi&s;hop's re&s;idence at Ro&s;e Ca&s;tle; a &s;ituation with which he was much plea&s;ed, not only on account of the natural beauty of the place, but becau&s;e it re&s;tored him to the country, in which he had &s;pent the be&s;t part of his life. In the year 1787, he paid this vi&s;it in a &s;tate of great weakne&s;s and exhau&s;tion; and died at Ro&s;e about a month after his arrival there, on the 14th day of Augu&s;t, and in the 84th year of his age.</P>
<P>The life of Dr. Law was a life of ince&s;&s;ant reading, and thought, almo&s;t entirely directed to meta|phy&s;ical and religious inquires; but the tenet by which his name and writings are principally di&s;tin|gui&s;hed, is "that Je&s;us Chri&s;t, at his &s;econd coming, will, by an act of his power, re&s;tore to life and con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s the dead of the human &s;pecies, who, by their own nature, and without this interpo&s;ition, would remain in the &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility, to which the death brought upon mankind by the &s;in of Adam had reduced them." He interpreted literally that &s;aying of St. Paul, 1 Cor. XV. 21. <Q>As by man came death, by man came al&s;o the re&s;urrection of the dead.</Q> This opinion had no other effect upon his own mind than to increa&s;e his reverence for Chri&s;tianity, and for its divine Founder. He retained it, as he did his other &s;peculative opinions, without laying, as many are wont to do, an extravagant &s;tre&s;s upon their importance, and without pretending to more certainty than the &s;ubject allowed of. No man formed his own conclu&s;ions with more freedom, or treated tho&s;e of others with greater candour and equity. He never quarrelled with any per&s;on for differing from him, or con&s;idered that difference as a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for que&s;tioning any man's &s;incerity, or judging meanly of his under&s;tanding. He was zealou&s;ly attached to religious liberty, becau&s;e he thought that it leads to truth; yet from his heart he loved peace. But he did not perceive any repugnancy in the&s;e two things. There was nothing in his elevation to his bi&s;hoprick which he &s;poke of with more plea&s;ure, than its being a proof that decent freedom of inquiry was not di&s;couraged.</P>
<P>He was a man of great &s;oftne&s;s of manners, and of the milde&s;t and mo&s;t tranquil di&s;po&s;ition. His voice was never rai&s;ed above its ordinary pitch. His countenance &s;eemed never to have been ruffled; it pre&s;erved the &s;ame kind and compo&s;ed a&s;pect, truly indicating the calmne&s;s and benignity of his temper. He had an utter di&s;like of large and mixed companies. Next to his books his chief &s;atisfaction was in the &s;erious conver&s;ation of a literary companion, or in the company of a few friends. In this &s;ort of &s;ociety he would open his mind with great unre&s;ervedne&s;s, and with a peculiar turn and &s;prightline&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion. His per&s;on was low, but well formed; his complexion fair and delicate. Except occa&s;ional interruptions by the gout, he had for the greate&s;t part of his life enjoyed good health; and when not confined by that di&s;temper, was full of motion and activity. About nine years before his death, he was
<PB N="56" REF="62">greatly enfeebled by a &s;evere attack of the gout in his &s;tomach; and a &s;hort time after that, lo&s;t the u&s;e of one of his legs. Notwith&s;tanding his fondne&s;s for exerci&s;e, he re&s;igned him&s;elf to this change, not only without complaint, but without any &s;en&s;ible diminution of his chearfulne&s;s and good humour. His fault (for we are not writing a panegyric) was the general fault of retired and &s;tudious characters, too great a degree of inaction and facility in his public &s;tation. The mode&s;ty, or rather ba&s;hfulne&s;s of his nature, together with an extreme unwillingne&s;s to give pain, rendered him &s;ometimes le&s;s firm and efficient in the admini&s;tration of authority than was requi&s;ite. But it is the condition of human mortality. There is an oppo&s;ition between &s;ome virtues which &s;eldom permits them to &s;ub&s;i&s;t together in perfection

He was a gentleman of the brighte&s;t parts, and had made great advances in all the branches of polite and &s;olid learning that could well be expected at his years. He was ble&s;t with &s;o &s;weet and humane a di&s;po&s;ition, that the common accidents of life gave him no la&s;ting di&s;quiet, nor interrupted that univer&s;al benevolence, which, with him, diffu&s;ed it&s;elf in a proportionable &s;cale of duty from the whole body of mankind to the meane&s;t &s;tranger.

<P><Q>Blackhall or Blackhill, commonly called Blackhell, is the name of the town and manor, &s;o called of old, before it was inhabited; being a black heathy ground, part of the ancient fore&s;t of Englewood, and given by Henry I. to Odard de Logis, baron of Wigton, and citizen of Carli&s;le, after the Flemings were thence tran&s;lated: Odard fir&s;t builded there and planted habitations, holding part in deme&s;ne, and the re&s;idue in &s;ervice; &s;ome free, which he granted forth to be holden freely; others in bondage and villanage, &s;ome both per&s;ons and land, &s;ome land only let to free men, per&s;ons, in that age, called Drenges; and the tenure, in law, is called, "Drengagium notandum e&s;t eos omnes eorum antece&s;&s;ores, qui Drengorum cla&s;&s;e erant, vel per Drengagium tenure, &s;ua in|colui&s;&s;e patrimonia ante adventum Normanorum.</Q>&mdash;SPELMAN.</P>

<P><HI>Extract of a Letter from Mr.</HI> RICHARD GOODMAN, <HI>Keeper of Carli&s;le Goal, dated</HI> 22d <HI>of July,</HI> 1728.</P>
<P><Q>The figure of a cre&s;cent I here &s;end you, is &s;ufficient to let you &s;ee what it is. It is of copper, found in digging a cellar oppo&s;ite to the Bu&s;h-Inn here. It lay about nine feet deep: as I looked upon it to be a choice piece of antiquity, I have procured the original for you: I take it to be a &s;ymbol of I&s;is, and al&s;o wore by other gods. The &s;hank or &s;tem, by which it was &s;tuck into the figure or &s;tandard is very &s;trong, and has a hole for a pin to fa&s;ten it; from which &s;hank, ari&s;es a ring on the back&s;ide, which is al&s;o very &s;trong, and will take in a man's finger. I pre&s;ume it might be to fa&s;ten &s;ome parts of the garb or for what other u&s;e, I beg your thoughts.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Extract from Mr.</HI> GALE's <HI>An&s;wer.</HI></P>
<P><Q>As for the bra&s;s plate you &s;ent me, it &s;eems to be nothing but an ornament belonging to the trappings of a hor&s;e, and might have hung before his brea&s;t, by the ring on the back&s;ide of it. The hole through the &s;hank has been for fa&s;tening a drop or pendant to it, as a further ornament.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In opening a gravel pitt lately, on the &s;ide of a hill, in the pari&s;h of Stanwix, ju&s;t without the &s;uburbs of Carli&s;le, a &s;tratum of bones were di&s;covered, at about a yard below the &s;urface, lying about a foot thick in mo&s;t parts, and &s;tretching the whole length of the pit, which I apprehend to be near twenty feet. I exa|mined the &s;pot, and found divers fragments of Roman pottery ware,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Elegant &s;pecimens, and &s;ome of the bones were exhibited.</NOTE> intermixed with the bones. They are, I think, the bones of hor&s;es, and might, perhaps,
<PB N="70" REF="76">have been buried after an engagement between the Romans and Picts; but it is not &s;o ea&s;y to account for the fragments of pottery, &amp;c. which were found in great numbers intermixed with them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>N. B. The Picts Wall ran within le&s;s than half a mile of the &s;pot where the&s;e bones were found.</Q>&mdash;Dated Dec. 18th, 1765, (&s;igned) C. LYTTLETON.</P>

<P>If we may pre&s;ume to offer our &s;entiments on the&s;e &s;ubjects, after the learned antiquaries have &s;o elaborately expatiated thereon, without the appearance of arrogance and pre&s;umption, we would &s;ugge&s;t, that the bones mentioned by the bi&s;hop, mixed with the fragments of the patarae, were the remains of &s;acrifice: when the ordinary receptacle was cleaned out, this has been the general repo&s;itory. If the&s;e were the remains of animals &s;lain in battle, the mixture is not to be reconciled; and it was more than &s;uch occa&s;ion would have required to clear them from the bones of men &s;lain at the &s;ame time. The learned inquirer did not di&s;|cover any remains of broken trapping, &s;tudings, or ornaments of hor&s;es, or men accoutrements. The hammers, or &s;tone hatchets, &s;eem very unfit for weapons of warfare, unweildy, and uncouth: if they had been in u&s;e in battle, &s;ome te&s;timony would have been given of them; and they would not have been totally di&s;u&s;ed, one might pre&s;ume, at the coming of the Romans, but would have been exhibited as trophies, or otherwi&s;e as te&s;timonies of the valour of Briti&s;h heroes, the anc&s;tors of tho&s;e who appeared armed again&s;t the invaders, in the mo&s;t &s;acred cau&s;e of war, the defence of liberty, and their country; and the maintenance of the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion. We have received no account of &s;uch weapons then in u&s;e. As dome&s;tic uten&s;ils, it is not probable they would have been &s;ecreted with &s;uch care, or de|po&s;ited with &s;uch &s;olemnity, as even to &s;upport the head of the decea&s;ed owner in the &s;epulchre. Could we imagine the friends of any per&s;onage, who was to be interred with the funeral pomp of a tumulus, would bu&s;y them&s;elves with giving the decea&s;ed labourer his beetle with him, for the regions of death We humbly conceive this was a &s;acred implement in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heathen prie&s;t, with which he prepared the &s;acrifice: we have innumerable relations, of the abhorrence the ancients had, of their &s;acred things and places being polluted by &s;trangers; and thence we trace the cau&s;e of the&s;e flints being concealed. All degrees of reli|gious, in remote ages, took great precaution to bury, with the con&s;ecrated mini&s;ter, the in&s;truments of his office, and that was followed in the practice of the ancient Romi&s;h church. The &s;acred <HI>&s;ecuris</HI> of the Briti&s;h prie&s;t, was the fir&s;t emblem of his function, and the propere&s;t ornament to be placed with his remains in the tomb. The remnants of Briti&s;h prie&s;ts were driven into Scotland by the arms of Rome; there they longe&s;t retained their ancient rites and religion, and there tho&s;e in&s;truments of the ancient prie&s;thood have been mo&s;t frequently found.

The watch-word being given, the parties formed into bodies, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the gates and avenues, and the earl, with the whole garri&s;on, &s;urrendered without further blood&s;hed.

The acce&s;&s;ion of the Stuart family to the crown of England &s;omewhat abated national animo&s;ities and mi&s;eries; and the union, by conferring reciprocal privileges, and opening a free intercour&s;e between the two countries, has obliterated invidious di&s;tinctions, and con|vinced the people on both &s;ides the Tweed, that their vicinity to each other &s;hould have induced their ance&s;tors, always to cultivate habits of amity and friend&s;hip with their neighbours.</P>
<P>From the wall, which may be a&s;cended in different parts by flights of &s;teps, the eye is entertained with a beautiful and exten&s;ive land&s;cape, and imperceptibly led into &s;everal di&s;tant counties, whil&s;t Scotland and Solway-Frith
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">And the adjacent mountains, &s;ome of who&s;e &s;ummits touch the clouds.</NOTE> do not a little contribute to enliven the enchanting &s;cene. The city is &s;urrounded with three rivers, Petteril on the &s;outh, Eden on the ea&s;t and north, and Caude on the we&s;t, who&s;e meandering &s;treams are &s;een in many places at a great di&s;tance.&mdash;A garri&s;on was formerly kept here; but there has been none for the la&s;t thirty years. The military who may be &s;tationed in the town for a time, are quartered upon the public hou&s;es in the city and &s;uburbs. Carli&s;le has &s;till a go|vernor and deputy governor, who&s;e places are only <HI>&s;ine cures.</HI> A town major, engineer, barrack ma&s;ter, &s;tore-keeper, head-gunner, three quarter-gunners, &amp;c. When the governor of this city happened to be one of its repre&s;entatives in parliament, the &s;ubordinate places in the garri&s;on were given to freemen, (but generally to &s;uch as were in the corporation) &s;o that frequently the <HI>chief magi&s;trate</HI> was a quarter-gunner at the &s;ame time. Thus was the invalid, worn out in the &s;ervice of his king and country, too frequently overlooked in the di&s;po&s;ition of this appointment.</P>
<P>Carli&s;le being a bi&s;hop's &s;ee, has a cathedral, in which are performed the cathedral &s;ervice; in the &s;ame edifice is performed the parochial &s;ervice of St. Mary's: and in a part of it the chancellor of the dioce&s;e holds the con&s;i&s;tory court. As this religious edifice is the chief ornament of the city, a &s;hort de&s;cription of it may, perhaps, not be deemed improper.</P>
<P>The choir of this venerable pile is the mo&s;t magnificent part of the building. It has a &s;tately &s;teeple, with a ring of eight bells, the roof is covered with lead, and being con&s;iderably higher than the other buildings in the city, has a very &s;ine effect when viewed as a di&s;tant object. This noble edi|fice being partly of Gothic and partly of Saxon architecture, offers what is worthy the in&s;pection of the architect and antiquarian. Contiguous to the cathedral is an exten&s;ive church-yard, (the principal bury|ing ground) &s;urrounded with a wall &s;even feet high, in the in&s;ide of which is a row of lofty plane trees, who&s;e branches overhang a part of the adjacent &s;treet and form a &s;hade, under which is a fine paved walk much re&s;orted to. Within the precincts of the abbey, be&s;ides the cathedral, there are &s;everal ve|nerable buildings, which (except the prebends' hou&s;es) &s;hew marks of antiquity.</P>
<P>St. Cuthbert's, the other pari&s;h church in Carli&s;le, is a modern edifice, rebuilt in the year 1778, upon the &s;ite of the old church, but without any kind of external or internal ornament. It has a &s;quare &s;teeple or tower, but &s;o confined as not to admit of a ring of bells; &s;o that the pari&s;hioners are called together to their devotion by the weak tinklings of the old bell, which was not exchanged for one of a louder tone.

The &s;ubordinate officers are three &s;erjeants at mace, five bedals, or town &s;ca|vengers. The &s;erjeants and bedals wear the corporation livery, and their places are generally for life. The &s;erjeants act as bailiffs in proce&s;&s;es before the mayor's court, and to them is committed the execution of &s;ummons and writs of arre&s;t for debt i&s;&s;ued by it.

<P>Carli&s;le, about the beginning of the pre&s;ent century, exhibited no marks of modern convenience and elegance. The buildings, mo&s;tly of wood, clay, and laths, be&s;poke the poverty and bad ta&s;te of the in|habitants. The gabels fronted the &s;treets, the doors were generally in the centre, and many of the hou&s;es had porches which projected two or three yards into the &s;treet, <HI>doubtle&s;s for warmne&s;s.</HI> The front door was arched, or Gothic, formed to corre&s;pond with the gabel; and the diminutive windows, which gave light to the inner apartments, were very improperly placed, but of the &s;ame order.
<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">The mo&s;t of the hou&s;es did not exceed the height of one &s;tory, and were chiefly covered with thatch. Tho&s;e of two &s;tories had the upper rooms inlaid with &s;trong oak, and unceiled below. The lanes and avenues, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ven the church road, were not paved: and in many places entirely covered with weeds and underwood. The &s;treets, not often trode upon, were, in many parts of them, green with gra&s;s.</NOTE> The doors were of oak, very &s;trong and clum&s;y, put together with large wood pins, a part of which projected an inch or two from the door. The&s;e pins were many in number, and &s;ometimes placed in figures romanticly irregular. Hou&s;es were not then painted either within or without; this being only a modern improve|ment. The &s;treets, though &s;pacious, were paved with large &s;tones, and the centre part or cau&s;eway, ro&s;e to a con&s;iderable height. The fronts from the hou&s;es were paved in the &s;ame manner, the con&s;equence of which was, that the kennels or gutters were deep trenches, and &s;tone bridges were placed in many different parts, for the convenience of pa&s;&s;ing from one &s;ide of the &s;treet to the other. The&s;e gutters were the re&s;ervoirs of all kinds of filth, which when a &s;udden heavy rain happened, by &s;topping the conduit of the bridges, inundated the &s;treets &s;o, as to render them impa&s;&s;able on foot.</P>
<P>The &s;hambles, which &s;tood in the market place, were private property, and being built entirely of wood and covered with different kinds of &s;late, gave them a very grote&s;que and antique appearance. At the north end of the &s;hambles was a well, over which was a building placed upon pillars, called Carnaby's
<PB N="78" REF="85">Folly. On the front of each &s;ide of this building was the fi&s;h market: the Folly and the &s;hambles have been lately taken down, the latter having been purcha&s;ed, at a great price, by the corporation. The former was their own property. For this the corporation de&s;erve the thanks of the inhabitants of Carli&s;le, as the &s;hambles, by occupying a great part of one of the principal &s;treets of the city, were a public nui&s;ance.</P>
<P>Little more than half a century ago, the inhabitants of Carli&s;le carried on no foreign commerce.&mdash; Their trade con&s;i&s;ted in that of a good weekly market, two annual fairs, and two extraordinary well at|tended &s;tatutes, for hiring &s;ervants. The annual fairs in this city, formerly drew together numbers of people from many parts of England and Scotland. The bu&s;ine&s;s for the whole year was &s;ettled at the&s;e meetings; as in many places the intercour&s;e between town and town, or man and man, was not yet car|ried on by way of port carriers, and other public conveyances. The a&s;&s;ize and public diver&s;ions con|tributed greatly to draw together the neighbouring gentry. Though there was very little trade and commerce in this city, yet the inhabitants did not &s;eem to know the want of it. The nece&s;&s;aries of life were uncommonly cheap, and the chief part of their wearing apparel was of their own &s;pinning.&mdash; Pride and luxury in eating, drinking, furniture and dre&s;s, had not yet made their entrance within the city walls; indu&s;try and ho&s;pitality were the prominent features of the people. The victuallers brewed their own ale, of a good quality, and &s;old it for threepence a quart, full mea&s;ure. And (&s;uch was the cu&s;tom of the place) &s;eldom did a company call for the &s;econd pot, without the landlord or landlady pre&s;enting them with the fare of the hou&s;e to reli&s;h their liquor. Spirituous liquors were very &s;eldom made u&s;e of: though the inhabitants were not opulent, yet many of them had con&s;iderable property, and for the mo&s;t part under a good tenure.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The principal part of the hou&s;es in Carli&s;le are freehold; a few are lea&s;ehold under the dean and chapter, and the corporation; and a &s;ew under the king.</NOTE></P>
<P>The town, at the time we are &s;peaking of, was not very populous, and therefore the office of mayor, or chief magi&s;trate, was con&s;idered to be of great con&s;equence. He &s;eldom appeared in public without the rod of ju&s;tice, and had always one of the &s;erjeants to attend him. The baleful &s;eeds of party were not then &s;own among the inhabitants, a friendly and neighbourly intercour&s;e pervaded the whole city. All the ancient cu&s;toms were kept up with harmony and fe&s;tivity, and man united to man by love and good fellow&s;hip, circum&s;tanced as the inhabitants were, living in the centre of a rich and well cultivated country, it is no wonder if their minds were free. In ages prior to this aera, they had been expo&s;ed to one continued &s;cene of warfare. Under this hazardous &s;ituation, it may rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed that, their contentions could not lead them to dive much into the my&s;teries and fluctuations attendant upon a trading intercour&s;e. And &s;uppo&s;e they had been in affluent circum&s;tances, it cannot be imagined they would have expended their money in building.

<P>This city continued in the &s;ituation above-mentioned, without any material alteration either in re&s;pect to trade or improvement in building, till the rebellion in 1745. Soon after this period, a company of Hamburgh merchants fixed upon Carli&s;le as a proper place to carry on an exten&s;ive woolen manufactory.
<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">This manufactory was carried on to a very great extent in broad and plain cloths. All the di&s;&s;erent branches of the bu&s;ine&s;s, from the &s;heep &s;hearing to the fini&s;hing the pieces, were performed. And as mo&s;t of the work was done in various parts of the country, the pari&s;hes were little affected by an increa&s;e of paupers; the purvey then &s;eldom ex|ceeding twenty or thirty in a year. This was the mode of collecting the poor rate at that time, and for long after.</NOTE> The di&s;tance from Lincoln&s;hire, York&s;hire, Scotland, and tho&s;e parts of the two kingdoms enriched with the &s;taple commodity, was a very incon&s;iderable object to this company of adventurers. To faci|litate this undertaking, two gentlemen (brothers) of the name of Dewlicher, were &s;ent over from the continent to &s;uperintend the work. This manufactory was of great importance to the inhabitants of Carli&s;le and the country around. It brought from various parts of the three kingdoms many workmen in the different branches of the woolen trade. People, to the di&s;tance of twenty miles from the city were employed, and every loom that could be got was engaged. The mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes were enter|tained, that the undertaking would an&s;wer the end propo&s;ed: and never were two men engaged in any bu&s;ine&s;s more carre&s;&s;ed by all ranks of people, than the Dewlichers were. A few years after this manu|factory was e&s;tabli&s;hed, the elder brother died, who had taken the mo&s;t active part of the bu&s;ine&s;s upon him&s;elf; and who, from its flouri&s;hing &s;tate during his life, &s;eemed to be every way competent to &s;o great a tru&s;t.

All the goods which came to this place from Newca&s;tle, were conveyed chiefly upon pack-hor&s;es; the roads were impa&s;&s;able the greate&s;t part of the &s;ea&s;on for any other conveyance. No public works were carried on, except a &s;mall manufactory for linen by an Alderman Cook, and a whip manufactory, under the firm of Brown and company, which employed a few paupers.

<P>Little increa&s;e in population had hitherto taken place. A few foot &s;oldiers and artillery men kept garri&s;on, and the&s;e were quartered chiefly upon the public.

<P><PB N="80" REF="87">About the year 1750, the trade of Carli&s;le began to have a different appearance. A manufactory of coar&s;e linen cloth, called O&s;naburghs was e&s;tabli&s;hed:
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The late aldermen, Richard and William Hodg&s;on, were the proprietors of this O&s;naburgh manufactory.</NOTE> this kind of work can be wrought by women and boys at the loom.

Blamire's manufactory was of &s;hort duration; and after his time, except what was done by the Machrells, and by one Thorpe, and this to no great amount, the bu&s;ine&s;s was no more pur&s;ued by any other adventurer.</P>
<P>At the period we are &s;peaking of, the military road between Carli&s;le and Newca&s;tle was begun. Prior to this date, this road from the city was by the Engli&s;h gate, and Warwick bridge; but now the route was changed, and travellers go by the Scotch-gate. The new road was planned near four miles more to the north than the old one. The badne&s;s of the road had hitherto been a great hindrance to the conveyance of merchant goods from Newca&s;tle to this place and Whitehaven: and Dumfries, from this circum&s;tance only, had greatly the advantage: but when this turnpike was completed, then the ca&s;e was much altered for the better. Large carts and waggons were &s;oon introduced, and nothing was now wanting but a &s;ufficient loading from Carli&s;le: this want was in &s;ome &s;ort &s;upplied by people buying up|on commi&s;&s;ion, and others upon their own account, and &s;ending off large quantities of butter and bacon for the London market.

Butter, before this time, was generally 20 or 22 ounces to the pound.</NOTE> was a gentleman of a per&s;evering &s;pirit, in making trial of the &s;everal modes of agriculture: no part of hu&s;bandry was lo&s;t in him for the &s;ake of expence, or procuring men u&s;ed to agricultural improvements. Mr. Holmes' laudable &s;pirit opened the eyes of the country in general, and every &s;ucceeding year added &s;omething to the former, to the advantage of the indu&s;trious hu&s;bandman. It has already been ob&s;erved, that manure was of little value; that what the &s;treets of Carli&s;le a&s;&s;orded was conveyed away by a per&s;on who had an annual &s;alary: it now became an article of value, and the produce of the &s;treets was generally put up to lett along with the corporation lands.
<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">This article now con&s;titutes a part of the corporation revenue, being let, <HI>communibus annis,</HI> for upwards of 50l.</NOTE></P>
<P>The county and city tolls were a part of the corporation revenue. The number of black cattle which came into England from Ireland and Scotland, by the way of Cumberland, and mo&s;tly by Carli&s;le, greatly increa&s;ed the value of the toll; but as the collecting of it was attended with trouble and danger, the drovers endeavouring to evade this toll as an impo&s;ition, it al&s;o underwent a trial at law, in which the drovers were defeated, on the grounds that the barrier fortre&s;s was &s;till maintained: but as the collecting of this toll from the&s;e refractory people, is &s;till attended with difficulty; the per&s;on who undertakes the whole farm from the corporation, generally lets it out in parcells to different people, who live mo&s;t con|tiguous to the places where the droves take their departure out of the county.</P>
<P>At this period, manufactories of linen and cotton began rapidly to encrea&s;e in Carli&s;le; and this increa&s;e in the branches of &s;pinning and weaving brought many Scotch and Iri&s;h weavers, with their families, to re&s;ide in the city and its environs. The population of the city had encrea&s;ed very little for forty or fifty years prior to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the&s;e manufactories. The bleaching of yarn was a con|&s;equent of the&s;e manufactories, and it went on very pro&s;perou&s;ly. Carli&s;le is a place very well adapted for carrying on the linen and cotton manufactories to a very great extent. The progre&s;s of improve|ment advanced with rapid &s;teps. Every year hou&s;es were rebuilt upon a more elegant plan, and al&s;o many new ones. The gra&s;s which disfigured the &s;treets, lanes, and avenues, began daily to di&s;appear.</P>
<P>In the year 1756, a brewery commenced in the &s;uburbs of the city, without the Iri&s;h Gates, under the firm of Atkin&s;on and Co. But the inhabitants of Carli&s;le and the neighbourhood, having been long accu&s;tomed to home brewed ale, did not reli&s;h this factory drink, &s;o that it was &s;ometime before this public brewery met with much encouragement: though after a few years' trial the prejudice was entirely removed, and the &s;ucce&s;s of the undertaking has &s;ufficiently proved its utility, and fully an&s;wer|ed the end the company had in view. The many new manufactories now begun, and the increa&s;e of population attendant on them rai&s;ed the purvey. But as this did not then &s;eem grievous to the ancient
<PB N="81" REF="88">inhabitants, I only mention it as a prelude to what afterwards became a &s;evere burthen. Not long after, the &s;treets of the city, and that part of the liberties without the walls, were paved upon a new plan. This alteration for the better (to the great credit of the corporation) removed many intolerable nui&s;an|ces. And the inhabitants of the &s;uburbs, and that part of the &s;uburbs which came under the direction of the &s;urveyor of the highways, were al&s;o put under a proper regulation. Richardgate felt the good effects of this alteration; being expo&s;ed to inundations from the overflowing of the river Eden, it now felt only in part what formerly was almo&s;t general.</P>
<P>In the year 1758, were brought here a number of French pri&s;oners from Edinburgh ca&s;tle. The&s;e were &s;oon followed by the regular troops of Thurot's &s;quadron, captured by the brave captain Elliot; and about three or four hundred more were &s;ent to Carli&s;le, from Launce&s;ton in Cornwall. All the&s;e pri&s;oners, except Thurot's regulars, were upon their parole of honour. As each of the&s;e pri&s;oners had &s;even &s;hillings a week regularly paid them, this cau&s;ed a deal of money to be expended. The French pri&s;oners were &s;oon after followed by the We&s;tmorland militia; and as the inhabitants of that county were much prejudiced again&s;t a military life, they entered into a voluntary &s;ub&s;cription to allow their balloted men, or &s;ub&s;titutes, an additional &s;um to the king's pay, &s;o that many of the privates had from one to three &s;hillings per day. Two companies of invalids kept garri&s;on in the ca&s;tle;
<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">The militia kept an officer's guard at Cromwell's Green-hou&s;e.</NOTE> and did al&s;o duty as centinels at the &s;everal gates. Such a number of men in the city, and &s;o well circum&s;tanced as to money, greatly benefited the place. The con&s;equence of this influx of wealth was, the introduction of more expen&s;ive modes of living. Now four wheeled carriages began to run from the different inns.
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dr. Waugh, Dean of Worce&s;ter, a coach and four hor&s;es; Major Farrer kept a &s;ingle hor&s;e chai&s;e; Mr. Dobin&s;on a &s;ingle hor&s;e chai&s;e; General Stanwix, a coach and &s;our hor&s;es, when the family was in town, which was but &s;eldom. The&s;e were all the private carriages kept in the city at this time.</NOTE> To this period, 1759, there had not been any public conveyance for travellers in po&s;t chai&s;e from this city. Hitherto balls and a&s;&s;emblies had been kept in a room at the ca&s;tle; and when any gave a ball it was chiefly at the Bu&s;h Inn: but now an a&s;&s;embly room is built, and fini&s;hed for that purpo&s;e, in a plain and neat manner.</P>
<P>The year 1761 &s;aw new works e&s;tabli&s;hed. A company from Newca&s;tle begun the calico printing bu&s;ine&s;s, which has been progre&s;&s;ively carried on ever &s;ince, and affords employment to many hundreds of men, women, and children. This was followed by an exten&s;ive manufactory, carried on by the in|genious Bernard Barton, who&s;e premature death deprived the public of the abilities of an able and enterpri&s;ing trade&s;man. The&s;e public works employed a great deal of good land about the city, &s;o that the value of ground, either in the &s;elling price or in letting, ro&s;e con&s;iderably: and the increa&s;e of population, owing to the&s;e cau&s;es, may rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed to occa&s;ion an equal ri&s;e in every other article bought and &s;old.</P>
<P>As the year 1761 was an aera of real advantage to Carli&s;le, both with re&s;pect to the pro&s;pect of an increa&s;ing commerce and the further progre&s;s of politics; the reader, we hope, will not deem it impro|per, that we are a little more particular. The printing or &s;tamping of Calico was introduced here about this period. Gentlemen from Newca&s;tle and its vicinity, under the firm of Scot, Lamb, and Co. were the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hers of this branch of trade, in the environs of Carli&s;le. And as the Calico bu&s;ine&s;s has been the principal means of increa&s;ing the population of the city, it is &s;ufficient to remark that the flouri&s;hing advances of this manufactory induced others to form them&s;elves into companies to begin and carry on the &s;ame bu&s;ine&s;s. Some of them were men unacquainted with commerce; for in former times a country E&s;q. would have thought it a degradation of his rank, to have his name entered with any company in a manufacturing or mercantile line. Time has removed this prejudice, and men are convinced that trade enriches, in particular, tho&s;e engaged in it, and the public in general. Common day labour for men not bred to any mechanic trade, and lint or two &s;pinning for women in indigent circum&s;tances, was all the employment that could be obtained. Eight pence or ten pence a day, without victuals, was as much as a labourer could earn, and a woman mu&s;t have worked very hard at her wheel to make a &s;hilling a week, The employment for children was winding pirns for weavers or twi&s;ting whips, for which they had only about eight pence per week, and generally worked &s;ixteen hours out of the twenty|four.</P>
<P>The e&s;tabli&s;hment of the calico manufactory greatly altered the ca&s;e. The work in the green or bleach|yard found employment for men and &s;tout boys. Apprentices were taken to the &s;everal branches of the work, viz. Drawers, Cutters, and Calico printers, at a genteel weekly allowance, and their wages in|crea&s;ed as they advanced in their &s;ervitude. Little boys were employed as tearing boys to the printers.
<PB N="82" REF="89">Women had tables &s;et out for them to pencil the colours into the pieces. Every table employed three or four female children; and even the younge&s;t boys and girls could make near two &s;hillings per week. Such encouragement brought numbers of families out of the country into the city and &s;uburbs, and &s;o great was the change, that a common labourer, who probably, with his wife's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, did not make above eight &s;hillings weekly, could, by having his family fixed in the manner repre&s;ented, ea&s;ily earn twenty or thirty &s;hillings a week. Nay, &s;uch was the infatuation of the young men, or de&s;ire of great wages, that many who had &s;erved an apprentice&s;hip to a mechanic trade, bound them&s;elves a new to the &s;tampery; and even tho&s;e that were married followed the &s;ame &s;teps, per&s;uaded that this manufactory would give the whole family bread. People of property reaped their advantage from this increa&s;e of population, as land and hou&s;es increa&s;ed in value.</P>
<P>The &s;everal manufactories began to thrive much beyond the mo&s;t &s;anguine expectation. People in trade, with little to begin with, acquired fortunes which enabled them to live in a much more &s;plendid &s;tyle than formerly. The town rapidly improved, and the land around increa&s;ed in value, far beyond what could have been fore&s;een. The advantages, however, were balanced by &s;ome inconveniences: people of pro|perty, who ta&s;ted not the &s;weets of a thriving trade, began to feel the di&s;advantages which aro&s;e from the increa&s;e of population. Before the year 1761, the poor rates were not felt by tho&s;e who paid them: forty purveys in a year was the annual collection. This was the mode pur&s;ued, and the inhabitants acted in the office of collecting by rotation. But the increa&s;e of manufactories invited numbers of &s;trangers here for bread. The town was &s;oon filled with Scotch and Iri&s;h families; and as the&s;e people had no place to return to, in ca&s;e of indigence and &s;ickne&s;s, they became a great burthen upon the ancient inha|bitants. This was not the only grievance; the mode of collection was very irregular, being &s;till by the old rate. New improvements did not pay any kind of proportion, nor did the manufacturers, though tho&s;e were the only people that throve by this increa&s;e of trade, and the cau&s;e which brought the&s;e &s;tran|gers to the city, pay any kind of rate for their valuable &s;tocks in trade. This cau&s;ed a general murmur among&s;t the ancient inhabitants, and a redre&s;s was loudly called for. A pound rate was thought to be the mo&s;t equitable mode, and after many ve&s;try meetings it was finally agreed to. All this time, neither the pari&s;h of St. Mary, or St. Cuthbert, had a common workhou&s;e: the poor were either let out, or paid out, in their own hou&s;es. The pari&s;h of St. Mary &s;eeing the di&s;advantage which aro&s;e from this mode of providing for the poor, entered into a &s;ub&s;cription to build a workhou&s;e; the good effects of which have been felt by the inhabitants, as well as by the poor that receive the benefit.</P>
<P>The chief part of the manufactoring bu&s;ine&s;s before the year 1761, con&s;i&s;ted of a few check and O&s;na|burg looms, and about a dozen of looms employed in weaving very fine linen. But after the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the manufactory of printed or &s;tamped calicoes, cotton looms were &s;et up. The &s;tamperies had before this, been &s;upplied with cottons from Lanca&s;hire, at an extraordinary expence in carriage; but now machinery for carding, roving, and &s;pinning of cotton, is erected in different places in the neigh|bourhood of the city, and they purcha&s;e their cottons at a cheaper rate. This machinery employs a great number of men and women, of old and young. Buildings, particularly in the environs, have a|mazingly increa&s;ed, and &s;o has every trade in proportion.&mdash;We &s;hall now only paticularize the different employments:&mdash;</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent there are four printfields which employ about one thou&s;and people, and pay above 20,000l. annually to the revenue. Their firms are Me&s;&s;rs. Lamb, Scot, For&s;ter, and Co.&mdash;Me&s;&s;rs. Lo&s;h and Co. Me&s;&s;rs. Mitchell, Ellwood, and Co &mdash;Me&s;&s;rs. Donald, Carrick, Shaw, and Co.&mdash;Me&s;&s;rs. Wood and Co. who employs above two hundred people in &s;pinning of cotton.&mdash;Me&s;&s;rs. For&s;ters have the mo&s;t exten&s;ive manufactory in the north of England, in all the branches from the raw materials to the fini&s;hing of checks, calicoes, mu&s;lins, and all kinds of fancy work.&mdash;Me&s;&s;rs. Fergu&s;ons are next in extent in &s;imilar articles.&mdash;Me&s;&s;rs. Langcake, M^cWilliam, and Co. manufacturers in &s;imilar articles.&mdash;Me&s;&s;rs. Stoddards, ditto&mdash;Mr. Thomas Pear&s;on, ditto.&mdash;Mr. Nixon, ditto.&mdash;Me&s;&s;rs. Wil&s;on and Co. mu&s;lins. &mdash;Be&s;ides the brewery previou&s;ly mentioned, a few years after another was e&s;tabli&s;hed near it, now under the firm of Me&s;&s;rs. Pattrick&s;on and Co. and lately Mr. Daniel Pattin&s;on erected another; the&s;e three breweries pay above 6000l. duty annually; and ju&s;t now there is another erected by Mr. Haugh.&mdash; There is a &s;oapry under the firm of Me&s;&s;rs. Barker and Langcake, which pays about 1500l. duty annually; when thereto is added the duties upon candles, leather, licences, and other things under the exci&s;e, Car|li&s;le pays above 100,000l. annual revenue.&mdash;Be&s;ides the&s;e public works, there are many others on a &s;maller &s;cale; and all the common trades are carried on to great perfection.</P>
<P>The late Mr. For&s;ter and &s;ons e&s;tabli&s;hed a bank here, and Mr. Wil&s;on another, which is of great &s;ervice to trade.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="90">WAGES, within the&s;e twelve months, have ro&s;e, much owing to the advance in all the nece&s;&s;aries of life.&mdash;Calico printers make from one and a half, to two guineas per week; carpenters, joiners, ma&s;ons, and bricklayers here 2s. 6d. per day; labourers, from 1s. to 1s. 8d.; weavers earn from 10s. to 1l. 1s. per week, according to their abilities; and the &s;ame with all the other trades.&mdash;For the former rate of wages, provi&s;ions, &amp;c. &s;ee our account of Brampton, being nearly the &s;ame, vol.

<P>FRIENDLY SOCIETIES were e&s;tabli&s;hed here about twenty years ago, and are now &s;even for men and three for women; con&s;i&s;ting of about twelve hundred members. A number of gentlemen are joined to the&s;e &s;ocieties, which add much to their re&s;pectability, and &s;trengthens their funds: their allowance to &s;ick and old members is in proportion to their funds; and members or their relatives are genteely buried at the &s;ociety's expence.&mdash;There are two ma&s;onic &s;ocieties con&s;i&s;ting of a number of re&s;pectable people.</P>

<HEAD>Further Particulars re&s;pecting Carli&s;le Market.</HEAD>
<P>LAMB, in the early part of the &s;ea&s;on, &s;ells for 1s. 3d. per lb. but continues lowering in value as it becomes le&s;s rare, till it may be bought for 3d halpenny, and 3d. per lb. From Chri&s;tmas till a|bout Lady-Day, ten to twelve carca&s;es of beef are weekly di&s;po&s;ed of in the market: from that time till Martinmas, &s;ixteen to eighteen may be &s;old per week; and from Martinmas to Chri&s;tmas, thirty-five to forty per week. The rea|&s;on why the number increa&s;es &s;o much in the latter period, is a prevalent cu&s;tom among the people in the neighbouring country, of buying a quantity of beef at that &s;ea&s;on to &s;alt and dry for the winter's u&s;e.&mdash;Salmon is caught in large quantities in the Eden, near Carli&s;le: it becomes in &s;ea&s;on the beginning of December, but as it brings a high price in London, Manche&s;ter, &amp;c. few purcha&s;ers are found here while it continues at about 2s. per lb. but as the &s;ea&s;on advances, the prices drop; becau&s;e, in warm weather, it can|not be &s;ent to a di&s;tance, and is there|fore &s;old in the neighbourhood at about 3d. per pound. In the autumn &s;almon is generally cheape&s;t, when &s;everal of the middling and lower cla&s;&s;es of people &s;alt and dry it: in that &s;tate, we pre&s;ume, it affords a very unwhol&s;ome food, tending to occa&s;ion &s;curvies and other impurities of the blood.</P>
<P>FUEL, is coal from Blenkin&s;op,
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Blenkin&s;op is the property of a Mr. Coul&s;on.</NOTE> Talkin, and Tindale-Fells, di&s;tant twenty, twelve, and fifteen miles to the ea&s;t, and are the property of the Earl of Carli&s;le. Coal from the fir&s;t mentioned place has the preference. That article is brought from the pits to market in &s;ingle hor&s;e carts,
<PB N="84" REF="91">and di&s;po&s;ed of, neither by weight or mea&s;ure, but by the cart load; con&s;equently a very di&s;criminating eye is nece&s;&s;ary to prevent being impo&s;ed on.&mdash;Coals that are &s;old by dealers, are commonly 5d. the Carli&s;le peck &mdash;Peats from Scaleby and Roweliff mo&s;&s;es, di&s;tant five miles, ten for a penny.</P>
<P>PUBLIC INNS here have good accommodation, both in rooms and &s;tabling.&mdash;The Bu&s;h-Inn, Engli&s;h|&s;treet, and Crown and Mitre, Ca&s;tle &s;treet, are the hou&s;es the mail-coaches put up at: the King's Arms, Grapes, Blue Bell, and Duke's Head, are al&s;o much re&s;orted to by travellers: there are &s;everal other good inns, both in the city and &s;uburbs.</P>
<P><HI>The Mail-Coaches and other public Carriages are numerous here.</HI>&mdash;Two mail-coaches &s;et out every morning for London, one by Manche&s;ter and the other by Borrowbridge: a heavy coach is al&s;o for|warded to the metropolis every Monday, Wedne&s;day, and Friday.&mdash;A mail-coach every afternoon to Gla&s;gow, and a mail diligence at the &s;ame time to Dumfries.&mdash;A diligence goes from this to Edinburgh every Monday, Wedne&s;day, and Friday; and to Newca&s;tle on Sundays, Tue&s;days, Wedne&s;days, and Fridays; and one to Whitchaven on Saturdays&mdash;The arrivals are in proportion to their &s;everal di&s;tances.</P>
<P>WAGGONS AND CARTS for the conveyance of goods are exceeding numerous here, being the great thorough-fair between England and Scotland: in this branch of commerce there are above two hundred hor&s;es employed: and as mo&s;t of the goods&s;tood in the public &s;treets during the market, great inconvenience was felt; now each are getting private warehou&s;es; and it is much to be wi&s;hed that a proper market|place was provided for the butchers, as their &s;hambles greatly incommode the &s;treets.</P>
<P>LITERATURE.] In this department, Carli&s;le can boa&s;t of many literary productions; and, perhaps, there are few towns in this kingdom where literature has flouri&s;hed more than it has done here of late years.&mdash;We &s;hall mention only the names of the authors and their works.</P>
<P>The Rev. W. Paley, D. D. Archdeacon of this dioce&s;e, publi&s;hed, while he re&s;ided in this city, Moral and Political Philo&s;ophy; Horae Paulinae; Rea&s;ons for Contentment; a View of the Evidence of Chri&s;tianity, and Occa&s;ional Sermons; all which works, as they po&s;&s;e&s;s a high degree of celebrity, &s;o have been well received by a di&s;cerning public.&mdash;The Rev B. Gri&s;dale, D. D. two occa&s;ional &s;ermons. &mdash;The Rev. J. D. Carlyle, B. D. Chancellor of this dioce&s;e, Pro&s;e and Poetical Tran&s;lations from the Arabic.&mdash;The Rev. R. Miln, A. M. di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ter, Lectures upon the Antedeluvian World, and Occa&s;ional Sermons.&mdash;The Rev. G. Thom&s;on, ditto, the Spirit of Modern Hi&s;tory, and Occa&s;ional Sermons.&mdash;R. Harrington, M. D. &s;everal Treati&s;es upon Air, Phlogi&s;ton, &amp;c.&mdash;J. Hey&s;ham, M. D. a Treati&s;e upon the Jail Fever, Bills of Mortality, &amp;c.&mdash;Mark Lon&s;dale, poems, and pieces adapted for the theatre.</P>
<P>ARTS, SCIENCES, &amp;c.] The&s;e have kept pace with the other improvements of this city.&mdash;Guy Head, an ingenious arti&s;t; who, from the years of infancy, manife&s;ted a &s;trong genius in painting and drawing; and to a fancy bold and vigorous, joined a&s;&s;iduity, rarely concentrated in one per&s;on. The talents of this gentleman are now likely to reflect honour on his native city, as he has been for &s;ome years re&s;ident in Italy, for the purpo&s;e of &s;tudying the excellent remains of the Italian ma&s;ters.&mdash;Robert Smirke, E&s;q. R. A. hi&s;torical painter, is a native of this county, and pa&s;&s;ed many of his juvenile years at Carli&s;le, where his father then re&s;ided, he gave &s;ome proofs of that genius which has &s;ince placed him at the head of one of the mo&s;t exalted departments of his profe&s;&s;ion&mdash;Robert Carlyle excells in drawing antiquities and copying: his drawing of the cathedral of Carli&s;le, and other antiquities, are &s;pecimens of his abilities this way, and do him credit, as they gained him the &s;ilver medal from the &s;ociety for the encourage|ment of the arts, &amp;c.&mdash;James Lowes, a &s;elf-taught draughts-man and engraver, who&s;e fir&s;t attempts as an arti&s;t, are coeval with the commencement of this hi&s;tory, and his improvement is to be traced in the work: we can always vouch for the accuracy, if not the elegance, of all his works.&mdash;John Howard, a native of this city, at pre&s;ent a teacher of Mathematics in Newca&s;tle, is well known to all the lovers of that &s;cience. He has the mo&s;t exten&s;ive knowledge of all the parts of mathematical learning, and is a &s;elf-taught genius. Robert Bowman, a pupil of his, (blind from his infancy) is al&s;o a rare in&s;tance of genius: he is a perfect ma&s;ter of the higher branches of the mathematics.&mdash;Jo&s;eph Strong, blind from his infancy, is a mu&s;ician and an arti&s;t: in the latter capacity he con&s;tructed a tolerable well toned organ, and is a great proficient in fancy-weaving. So true it is, that with a &s;ound judgment, a ready apprehen|&s;ion, and &s;trong imagination, great progre&s;s may be made without &s;ight in the arts and &s;ciences.&mdash;Edward Fo&s;ter, clock-maker, has con&s;tructed a clock and planetarium, upon an exten&s;ive and variegated &s;cale. It is the production of twenty years' &s;tudy and labour: its dimen&s;ions are nine feet high, five feet broad, three feet deep; and con&s;i&s;ts of four principal parts: 1&s;t, It &s;hews the &s;econds, minutes, and hours of the day; the fa&s;ts and fe&s;tivals; the equation of time; the perpetual day of the month; the place of the moon's nodes, or the part of the ecliptic inter&s;ected by her orbit. 2d, The Copernic, or true &s;olar &s;y&s;tem

<P>1779. THE advantages which may be derived from accurate regi&s;ters of mortality, are thus illu&s;trated by an ingenious philo&s;opher and phy&s;ician. <Q>The e&s;tabli&s;hment of a judicious and accurate regi&s;ter of the births and burials, in every town and pari&s;h, would be attended with the mo&s;t important advantages, medical, political, and moral. By &s;uch an in&s;titution, the increa&s;e or decrea&s;e of certain di&s;ea&s;es; the comparative healthine&s;s of different &s;ituations, climates, and &s;ea&s;ons; the influence of particular trades and manufactures on longevity; with many other curious circum&s;tances, not more intere&s;ting to phy&s;icians than beneficial to mankind, would be a&s;certained with tolerable preci&s;ion. In a political view, exact regi&s;ters of human mortality are of &s;till greater con&s;equence, as the number of people, and progre&s;s of population in the kingdom, may, in the mo&s;t ea&s;y and unexceptionable manner, be deduced from them. They are the foundation, likewi&s;e, of all calculations concerning the values of a&s;&s;urances on lives, rever&s;ionary payments, and of every &s;cheme for providing annuities for widows, and per&s;ons in old age. In a moral light al&s;o, &s;uch <HI>Tables</HI> are of evident utility, as the increa&s;e of vice or virtue may be determined, by ob&s;erving the proportion which the di&s;ea&s;es ari&s;ing from luxury, in|temperance, and other &s;imilar cau&s;es bear to the re&s;t; and in what particular places di&s;tempers of this cla&s;s are found to be mo&s;t fatal.</Q>&mdash;<HI>Percival's E&s;&s;ays, vol. II.</HI></P>
<P>CARLISLE is &s;ituated in latitude 54, 55 north, and is &s;urrounded by a wall about a mile and a quarter in circumference. The &s;ituation is rendered exceedingly plea&s;ant by its vicinity to three beautiful rivers, with which it is almo&s;t &s;urrounded, viz. the Eden on the north ea&s;t &s;ide, Petteral on the &s;outh ea&s;t, and Caldew on the north-we&s;t. The air about Carli&s;le is pure and dry, the &s;oil chiefly &s;and and clay. No mar&s;hes or &s;tagnant waters corrupt the atmo&s;phere; its neighbourhood to a branch of the &s;ea, and its due di&s;tance from the mountains on all &s;ides, render the air temperate and moderate.</P>
<P>In July 1763, at the reque&s;t of Dr. Littleton. Lord Bi&s;hop of Carli&s;le, the inhabitants were numbered with great care and attention by the Rev. Mr. Richard&s;on, the Rev. Mr. Simp&s;on, and Mr. Alderman Hodg&s;on. There were at that time in the city and &s;uburbs, 1059 families, and 4158 inhabitants.</P>
<P>In January 1780, a very careful and accurate &s;urvey was made by Mr. Stanger and Mr. Howard, under my own in&s;pection. When there were in the di&s;trict, before &s;urveyed, 891 hou&s;es, 1605 families, and 6299 inhabitants&mdash;For a more particular account of the &s;urvey.&mdash;See Tables I. II. III.</P>
<P>This a&s;toni&s;hing increa&s;e of 2141 inhabitants, which is above half of the original number, in the &s;mall &s;pace of &s;eventeen years, may, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, be attributed to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of manufactories.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="97">This increa&s;e of population too has taken place, during that very period in which Dr. Price a&s;&s;erts the depopulation of Great Britain to have been rapid and progre&s;&s;ive: and what makes this increa&s;e more remarkable, Carli&s;le has, during the whole period alluded to, been con&s;tantly &s;upplying the army, the navy, the metropolis, and even the di&s;tant regions of India, with her hardy, active, and enterprizing &s;ons.</P>
<P>From tables, number IV. V. and VI. we can with plea&s;ure demon&s;trate the extreme &s;alubrity of Carli&s;le, even in a very unhealthy year; a year in which no le&s;s than 129 per&s;ons were cut off by two epidemic di&s;orders, viz. the &s;mall pox and &s;carlet fever. By the bills of mortality publi&s;hed in different towns in England, as well as the continent, it appears on an average, that in Vienna about 1 in 19 and a half of the inhabitants die annually; in London, 1 in 20 and three quarters; in Edinburgh, 1 in 20 and four fifths; in Leeds, 1 in 21 and three fi&s;ths; in Dublin, 1 in 22; in Rome, 1 in 23; in Am&s;terdam, 1 in 24; in Bre&s;law, 1 in 25; in Berlin, 1 in 26 and a half, in Northampton and Shrew&s;bury, 1 in 26 and a half; in Liverpool, 1 in 27 and a half; in Manche&s;ter, 1 in 28; in Che&s;ter, 1 in 40; but in the year 1774, when the &s;mall pox were very general and fatal, 1 in 27; and in the pari&s;h of Sedburgh, in the county of York, 1 in 37 and a half; and in Blandford Forum in Dor&s;et, 1 in 39; in Carli&s;le, this year, 1 in 30 and three ninths&mdash;See Table VII.</P>
<P>Tables, number III. V. and VI. are of the utmo&s;t importance to the phy&s;ician, the politician, and the calculator of annuities, and to every one who has the health and happine&s;s of him&s;elf and family at heart. They clearly demon&s;trate, as far as one year's ob&s;ervation can have weight, what periods of life are the mo&s;t healthy, what are the mo&s;t obnoxious to di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>As no particular epidemic di&s;ea&s;e occurred la&s;t year, which had any con&s;iderable effect on the lives of adult per&s;ons, it is apprehended the&s;e calculations for the periods above ten years old, will not be attend|ed with much variation in other years.</P>
<P>That women in general live longer than men, is almo&s;t univer&s;ally agreed, and the following ob&s;erva|tions tend much to confirm the truth of this opinion. During the la&s;t year twelve per&s;ons died between eighty and ninety years old, eight of the&s;e were females, and between ninety and a hundred, two died, both females.&mdash;See table VI. In table III. we &s;ee two people are above 100 years old, and the&s;e like|wi&s;e are females.</P>
<P>Table II. which contains the number of hu&s;bands, wives, &amp;c. &s;hews how inferior in number widowers are to widows. There are above four widows to one widower: an a&s;toni&s;hing di&s;proportion; in what manner is it to be accounted for? The following cau&s;es are conceived to operate con&s;iderably:</P>
<P>1&s;t, Men are, in general, more intemperate than women. 2d, They are expo&s;ed to greater hard&s;hips and dangers. 3d, Widowers, perhaps, in general, have greater opportunities of getting wives, than wi|dows have of getting hu&s;bands. 4th, Widows have a greater propen&s;ity to live in towns than widowers.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Women, in general, and more e&s;pecially among the middle ranks of life, marry earlier than men.</NOTE> 5th and la&s;tly, The con&s;titutions of males, as fitted for more violent and laborious exertions, are firmer and more robu&s;t than tho&s;e of females: their mu&s;cular and nervous fibres, may therefore be &s;uppo&s;ed to become &s;tiff, rigid, and incapable of performing the functions nece&s;&s;ary to health and life &s;ooner than tho&s;e of females, both on account of their original texture, and the friction which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily occur from laborious exerci&s;e. But from whatever cau&s;es the difference of longevity betwixt males and females may ari&s;e, the fact it&s;elf is &s;ufficiently a&s;certained by table VI. where we find, that between the ages of &s;ixty and &s;eventy, although there are a greater number of wives than hu&s;bands, yet eleven hu&s;bands and only four wives have died, and of all different ages twenty-nine hu&s;bands and &s;ixteen wives.</P>
<P>During this year two epidemics raged with uncommon violence, and &s;wept off a great number of chil|dren, viz. the &s;mall pox, and a &s;pecies of the &s;carlet fever.</P>
<P>As the per&s;ons affected with the &s;mall pox were chiefly of the lower cla&s;s, who &s;eldom called in medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance, it is impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain the preci&s;e number: from the information, however, which I have had, it appears, that about 300 were, during the la&s;t &s;ix months of the year, &s;eized with the &s;mall pox in the natural way: of the&s;e no le&s;s than ninety fell victims to its virulence. Hence, near one in three died of all that were affected with the natural &s;mall pox; which, while at the &s;ame time, it &s;erves as a melan|choly proof of its fatal effects, points out the great and &s;alutary advantages which are derived from ino|culation. During the &s;ame period &s;everal hundreds were inoculated in the neighbourhood of Carli&s;le, and it is a plea&s;ing truth, that not one of them died. Had tho&s;e 300 been inoculated, it is more than probable, that of the ninety not above &s;ix would have died; and even the&s;e not of inoculation, but of other di&s;orders. Hence we &s;ee eighty-four per&s;ons might have been &s;aved to their parents and the public. Yet &s;o great is the prejudice again&s;t the &s;alutary practice of inoculation among&s;t the vulgar, that
<PB N="87" REF="98">few, very few, can be prevailed upon, either by promi&s;es, rewards, or intreaties, to &s;ubmit to the opera|tion. No wonder, that in rude, ignorant, and barbarous times, &s;uper&s;tition hurried men into the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ab&s;urdities; when in a poli&s;hed and enlightened age, in an age too, when the experience of full twenty years has clearly demon&s;trated the utility of inoculation, we &s;ee the bulk of mankind ready to &s;acrifice their children, and all that is dear to them, to a fooli&s;h prejudice.</P>
<P>FOR THE YEAR 1780.] The population of Great Britain mu&s;t ever be a &s;ubject de&s;erving the atten|tion of every lover of his country, and e&s;pecially &s;ince the commencement of the pre&s;ent war, it has be|come highly intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>Within the&s;e few years, &s;ome very able writers have publi&s;hed their thoughts and calculations on this &s;ubject. Tho&s;e who are willing to depreciate the re&s;ources of this country, and to magnify tho&s;e of our enemies, have endeavoured to per&s;uade us, that our &s;ituation is truly lamentable, and that population has rapidly and progre&s;&s;ively decrea&s;ed for this twenty or thirty years pa&s;t.</P>
<P>The data from which the&s;e calculations and inferences have been made, are principally the returns of the window &s;urveyors, and the books of the cu&s;toms and exci&s;e.</P>
<P>Others, who from different &s;ources of information, have attempted to confute &s;uch &s;entiments, have pre&s;ented us with a more favourable picture; they, with much appearance of truth, have endeavoured to prove, that the number of inhabitants in Great Britain, in&s;tead of decrea&s;ing, has con&s;iderably increa&s;ed, during the period above alluded to. In &s;upport of the latter hypothe&s;is, I think it may not be improper to mention the following facts:&mdash;</P>
<P>In the beginning of the year 1780, I made an actual, and I believe an accurate, &s;urvey of the two pa|ri&s;hes, St. Mary's and St. Cuthbert's, and found they contained 1148 hou&s;es, 1872 families, and 7677 inhabitants
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See la&s;t year's ob&s;ervations on the bills of mortality for Carli&s;le.</NOTE> A few months afterwards, another actual &s;urvey was made of the two pari&s;hes, by Mr. Coul&s;on, general &s;urveyor of the four northern counties for the window-tax, and Mr. William Monkhou&s;e, &s;urveyor of Cumberland, Leith, and E&s;kdale wards; and though I have every rea&s;on to apprehend, that their &s;urvey was much more accurate, than &s;urveys for the window-tax heretofore have been, yet they only returned 815 hou&s;es; the difference therefore between the real number of hou&s;es, and the number returned to the window-tax is 333. Now, to &s;hew how fallacious all calculations are, with re&s;pect to the number of inhabitants in any particular place, founded on the returns of the &s;urveyors of the window-tax, even when they make the mo&s;t accurate &s;urvey. Let us &s;uppo&s;e I had wanted to a&s;certain the number of inhabitants in Carli&s;le and the adjoining villages, and had been ignorant of the real number of hou&s;es which they contained, I &s;hould have multiplied 815 by 6 and two thirds, which is nearly the number of people in each hou&s;e, the product will be 5433 nearly, which is 2244 le&s;s than the real number or two &s;evenths nearly of the whole. And if I had been ignorant of the number of inhabitants in each hou&s;e, I &s;hould mo&s;t probably have multiplied 815 by 6, which would have made the difference &s;till more con&s;i|derable.</P>
<P>The &s;alubrity of Carli&s;le was proved by the bills of mortality publi&s;hed la&s;t year; and it appears &s;till more evident from the pre&s;ent, for only 1 in 34 and a half nearly, of all the inhabitants have died this year, in con&s;equence of di&s;ea&s;es&mdash;See Table VII.</P>
<P>Table VI. coroborates the ob&s;ervations made in the la&s;t year's bills, viz. that women live longer than men; for between 100 and 103 years old, two per&s;ons died, who were both females; 26 hu&s;bands, and only 15 wives have died, although there are a greater number of wives than hu&s;bands in Carli&s;le.</P>
<P>FOR THE YEAR 1781.] People of all ranks, ages, and conditions of life, enjoyed an uncommon de|gree of health during the fir&s;t three months of this year; for, within that period, no more than twenty-three per&s;ons died; and of the&s;e, fifteen were either very young children, or old and infirm. But about the beginning of April, a very epidemic fever, evidently the <HI>Typhus Carcerum,</HI> began to make its appearance. It broke out in a hou&s;e in Rickergate, which contains about half a dozen very poor families; the rooms are exceeding &s;mall, and in order to dimini&s;h the window-tax, every window, that even poverty could di&s;pen&s;e with, was &s;hut up: hence &s;tagnation of air, which was rendered &s;till more noxious by the filth and uncleanline&s;s of the people. The &s;urgeon who attended &s;ome of tho&s;e poor wretches, told me, the &s;mell was &s;o offen&s;ive and di&s;agreeable, that it was with difficulty he could &s;tay in the hou&s;e, while he inquired into the &s;ituation of his patient. One of the per&s;ons affected with the fever in this hou&s;e was a weaver, who, on his recovary, went to his u&s;ual employment at a large work-&s;hop, where he communi|cated the di&s;order to his fellow-weavers, and from thence the fever &s;pread all over the town. It, however, chiefly. I may almo&s;t &s;ay entirely, raged among&s;t the common and lower ranks of people, and more e&s;pe|cially among&s;t tho&s;e who lived in narrow, clo&s;e, confined lanes, and in &s;mall, crowded apartments. It
<PB N="88" REF="99">affected adults more frequently than children; the infirm, than the robu&s;t; women than men; and the married were more &s;ubject to it than the &s;ingle. Three or four per&s;ons in a family were frequently &s;eized with it, one after another. It was almo&s;t altogether confined to this place, none being &s;eized with it ever in the neighbouring villages, except in a very few in&s;tances, where the feeds of it were evidently carried by &s;ome per&s;ons who had laboured under the di&s;ea&s;e. In the &s;hort &s;pace of about eight months, near five hun|dred per&s;ons were affected with this fever, forty-eight of whom died; of the&s;e, one was under five years o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> age; two between five and ten; one between ten and fifteen; two between fifteen and twenty; one be|tween twenty and thirty; eight between thirty and forty; thirteen between forty and fitty; twelve between fifty and &s;ixty; &s;ix between &s;ixty and &s;eventy; two between &s;eventy and eighty years.</P>
<P>The &s;mall pox were con&s;tantly in town all this year, but made little or no progre&s;s till towards th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> latter end of October, when they became rather more general, but they could &s;carce ever be &s;aid to rag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> as an epidemic: nineteen only died. No other epidemic appeared, and indeed, excepting the jail fever this year was by no means unhealthy. Great numbers were inoculated both in the town and country villages.</P>
<P>During the pre&s;ent year, 1 in 38 and 3 fifths of all the inhabitants have died in con&s;equence of di&s;|ea&s;es&mdash;See Table VII.</P>
<P>The difference of the number of deaths of hu&s;bands and wives, is not near &s;o great as it was in the years 1779 and 1780; yet &s;till the deaths of the former exceed tho&s;e of the latter by two; for thirty three hu&s;bands and only thirty-one wives have died, which difference is not the le&s;s extraordinary than i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the two preceding years, when we con&s;ider, in the fir&s;t place, that the con&s;titutions of women are more predi&s;po&s;ed to be acted upon by the contagion of the Jail Fever than tho&s;e of men; and in the &s;econd that they are, from their habits and &s;ituations in life, infinitely more expo&s;ed to that contagion. Between eighty and ninety years of age, five males and four females, and between ninety and an hundred, three females have died.&mdash;See Table VI.</P>
<P>FOR THE YEAR 1782.] Upon the whole, this year, notwith&s;tanding it was &s;o extremely cold and wet cannot be con&s;idered as an unhealthy one. The <HI>Typhus Carcerum,</HI> or <HI>Jail Fever,</HI> which raged with &s;o much violence la&s;t year, gradually declined, and was &s;carcely to be met with after May. Sixteen per&s;ons died of it.</P>
<P>And although the &s;mall pox were con&s;tantly in town, yet they were neither general nor very fatal&punc; Thirty per&s;ons only died of that di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>In the beginning of June, the <HI>Catarrhus Contagio&s;us</HI> or <HI>Influenza</HI> became general; very few families either in the town or country, e&s;caping its influence. It is, perhaps, the mo&s;t contagious of all di&s;orders to which the human body is &s;ubject; and were it as fatal as it is infectious, it would &s;oon depopulate the world. When it once breaks out, it does not, like the &s;mall pox, the plague, or the jail fever, confine it&s;elf to a city, a province, or a kingdom; but traver&s;es whole continents, and is &s;ometimes wafted acro&s;s the Atlantic Ocean. It has raged no le&s;s than eleven or twelve times as an epidemic in Europe, within the pre&s;ent century, and pretty generally exhibits the &s;ame phoenomena; yet no barrier has hitherto been di&s;covered to arre&s;t its progre&s;s; nor have the cau&s;es which fir&s;t produced it at each period, been yet a&s;certained. Fortunately, however, it is a very mild di&s;ea&s;e, differing little from the common catarrh or cold, except that the febrile &s;ymptoms are more con&s;tant and rather more &s;evere. The Influenza attacked every age, &s;ex, and apparently people of every habit; yet it is evident, a predi&s;po&s;ition was required, as &s;everal, and among the re&s;t my&s;elf, who were frequently expo&s;ed to the contagion, e&s;caped the di&s;ea&s;e. In what that predi&s;po&s;ition con&s;i&s;ts, remains yet to be di&s;covered. It fini&s;hed its cour&s;e in the neighbour|hood of Carli&s;le, in about the &s;pace of three weeks or a month; and its &s;ymptoms were here &s;o mild, that medical advice was &s;eldom &s;ought for. One per&s;on only is &s;uppo&s;ed to have died of it in Carli&s;le, viz. a woman &s;ixty-five years of age. During this year 1 in 38 of all the inhabitants have died in con|&s;equence of di&s;ea&s;es.&mdash;See Table VII.</P>
<P>Hitherto the number of deaths of hu&s;bands, has con&s;iderably exceeded tho&s;e of wives, each year: but during the pre&s;ent year, the deaths of wives &s;omewhat exceed; for twenty-two wives, and only twenty hu&s;bands have died.&mdash;See Table VI.</P>
<P>Between eighty and ninety years of age, five males and nine females; and between ninety and a hun|dred, one male and two females have died; between a hundred and one, and a hundred and two years of age, one female, viz a widow, died during the pre&s;ent year.&mdash;See Table VI.</P>
<P>In the month of Augu&s;t not one per&s;on died in the pari&s;h of St. Cuthbert, a circum&s;tance which has not occurred the&s;e twenty years.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="100">FOR THE YEAR 1783.] The pre&s;ent year has been much more healthy, than any of the preceding years; on which, ob&s;ervations on the bills of mortality in Carli&s;le have been made: for, notwith&s;tanding the number of inhabitants has con&s;iderably increa&s;ed, yet the number of deaths is by no means &s;o great, one hundred and eighty one per&s;ons only have died.</P>
<P>No dangerous or fatal epidemic, except the &s;mall pox, raged with any degree of violence.&mdash;The wea|ther, during the latter end of June, the whole of July, and part of Augu&s;t, was extremely hot and &s;ultry; the atmo&s;phere was replete with the electric fluid; and there was more thunder and lightening than ever was remembered, even by the olde&s;t per&s;on. This &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere was by no means peculiar to the neighbourhood of Carli&s;le, but was pretty univer&s;al throughout Europe.</P>
<P>In September and October, the &s;mall pox became &s;o general, and were of &s;o fatal a kind, that the monthly committee of the di&s;pen&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ry were of opinion, that a general inoculation of the poor and indi|gent inhabitants, would be attended with very beneficial effects. Early in the month of November, a ge|neral inoculation accordingly took place. Great numbers were inoculated, not only by the &s;urgeon to the di&s;pen&s;ary, but al&s;o by mo&s;t of the other &s;urgeons in the town. By this &s;alutary mea&s;ure the city of Carli&s;le was, in the &s;pace of two months, totally freed from a mo&s;t dangerous and fatal di&s;order which has been raging in different parts of the county with the utmo&s;t violence. The number of per&s;ons affected with the natural &s;mall pox in Whitehaven, within the la&s;t &s;ix months, have been almo&s;t incredible, and it is a melancholy truth, that &s;carcely one in three &s;urvived. In Wigton and its neighbourhood they have been al&s;o extremely general and fatal.</P>
<P>Twenty nine hu&s;bands and twenty three wives have died this year.&mdash;See Table VI.</P>
<P>Between eighty and ninety years of age, four males and &s;even females, &s;ix of whom were widows; and between ninety and an hundred, one male and one female have died.&mdash;See Table VI.</P>
<P>Nineteen only fell victims to the &s;mall pox, and &s;eventeen of the&s;e were children under five years of age.</P>
<P>A poplexies were remarkably frequent this year; no le&s;s than nine per&s;ons having died of that di&s;|temper.&mdash;The number of deaths were remarkably equal during all the &s;ea&s;ons; forty-&s;even died in winter, forty-two in the &s;pring, forty five in the &s;ummer, and forty-&s;even in autumn.&mdash;See Table IV.</P>
<P>During the pre&s;ent year, 1 in 43 and 1-7th of all the inhabitants have died in con&s;equence of di&s;ea&s;es. &mdash;See Table VII.</P>
<P>FOR THE YEAR 1784.] In the ob&s;ervations on the bills of mortality for la&s;t year, I took notice of the extreme healthine&s;s of that &s;ea&s;on; it is, however, with peculiar &s;atisfaction I am able to inform the public, that it has been far exceeded in &s;alubrity by the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>One hundred and fifty-four per&s;ons only have died, which are fewer by twenty-&s;even than died la&s;t year; and in the year 1779, the number &s;wept off by two di&s;ea&s;es only, viz. the &s;mall pox and &s;carlet fever was nearly equal to the whole number of deaths this year, whether occa&s;ioned by di&s;ea&s;es or acci|dents.</P>
<P>This remarkable degree of healthine&s;s may be accounted for, from the ab&s;ence of almo&s;t all epidemical di&s;orders; for not one made its appearance except the &s;mall pox, which were of a very mild kind, and proved fatal to no more than ten per&s;ons, nine of whom were under five years of age. How to account for the ab&s;ence of all other epidemic and contagious di&s;ea&s;es, is not &s;o ea&s;y.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the weather, I &s;hall only remark that the pre&s;ent year commenced and ended with the &s;evere&s;t and longe&s;t continued fro&s;ts ever remembered &s;ince the year 1740. The &s;ummer too was uncom|monly cold and wet, and yet was the healthie&s;t &s;ea&s;on, as may be &s;een by examining table IV.</P>
<P>Whether the &s;everity of the fro&s;t had any effect in purifying the air, and hence rendering it unfavour|able to the propagation, &amp;c. &amp;c. of epidemical di&s;orders, perhaps, may be doubted; but it certainly ope|rated mo&s;t powerfully in the production of an ob&s;tinate cutaneous di&s;ea&s;e, by phy&s;icians denominated, Herpes; but by the common people and empiries, called Scurvy, though it is e&s;&s;entially different from that di&s;order.</P>
<P>This cutaneous complaint, viz. Herpes, has been extremely prevalent, and remarkably ob&s;tinate the&s;e two la&s;t winters, and has appeared under a variety of forms.</P>
<P>The number of deaths of hu&s;bands &s;till continues to exceed that of wives, and this year in a very great proportion, for twenty nine hu&s;bands have died, but only twenty wives.&mdash;See Table VI.</P>
<P>Four widowers, and twenty-four widows have died.</P>
<P>Between eighty and ninety years of age, four males and nine females, eight of whom were widows; and between ninety and an hundred, one male and three females have died.&mdash;See Table VI.</P>
<P>Hitherto the number of males born has exceeded the number of females; but this year it is the rever&s;e, for 121 males and 153 females have been chri&s;tened.&mdash;See Table VIII.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="101">During this year, 1 in 50 and 1-6th nearly, of all the inhabitants have died in con&s;equence of di&s;ea&s;es. &mdash;See Table VII.</P>
<P>FOR THE YEAR 1785.] The pre&s;ent year, like the la&s;t, was u&s;hered in by a very &s;evere and long con|tinued fro&s;t. There was al&s;o a con&s;iderable fall of &s;now; and a complete thaw, which was &s;low, gradual, and without rain, did not take place till near the middle of April. The thaw was &s;ucceeded by cold ea&s;terly winds, which continued a long time; and a greater degree of drought was &s;carcely ever remem|bered. The fields were parched, the &s;prings and rivers were almo&s;t dried up, circum&s;tances not to be wondered at, when we con&s;ider that there was no rain, a very few &s;light &s;howers excepted, from the month of October, 1784, till the 29th of July. On that day we had, in the neighbourhood of Carli&s;le, a great deal of thunder and lightning, accompanied by a mo&s;t violent and heavy rain; and from that time, till near the end of the year, the weather became moi&s;t and warm.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this long continued drought, the weather was never exceedingly hot or &s;ultry; which may probably be the rea&s;on why dangerous di&s;orders were not more prevalent. For this year was far from being unhealthy, no epidemic di&s;ea&s;es occurring, but &s;uch as had ari&s;en before the dry and warm &s;ea&s;on came on; which, therefore, could have no effect in producing them.</P>
<P>Very early in the month of January, the jail fever, which I believe fir&s;t originated among the felons confined in the jail, began to make its appearance in the city, and continued to rage almo&s;t the whole of the year. As the poore&s;t cla&s;s of inhabitants chiefly &s;uffered from it: its progre&s;s, &amp;c. will be be&s;t a&s;|certained by examining the books of the di&s;pen&s;ary, where I find four patients, labouring under the di&s;|order, were admitted in the month of January; four in February; four in March; three in April; eight in May; eight in June; ten in July: fifteen in Augu&s;t; nineteen in September; eleven in Octo|ber; and eleven in November. In December it &s;eems to have almo&s;t entirely cea&s;ed, for not one was admitted during that month. Ninety-&s;even patients, affected with this fever, were therefore admitted into the di&s;pen&s;ary in the &s;pace of eleven months.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent epidemic was of the &s;ame nature as that which appeared at Carli&s;le in the year 1781, and of which I publi&s;hed an account. It, however, differed in &s;ome few particulars, which difference I &s;hall briefly relate. 1. It did not rage &s;o univer&s;ally, the contagion, probably, not being &s;o virulent. 2. The &s;ymptoms, in general, were more mild. 3. Petechiae and haemorrhages were &s;eldom ob&s;erved. 4. A greater proportion of children were affected. 5. Relap&s;es were much more frequent. In the fever of 1781, I did not &s;ee one in&s;tance of a relap&s;e; whereas in the pre&s;ent, it was a very common circum|&s;tance; &s;everal patients having even two relap&s;es.</P>
<P>Of the ninety-&s;even patients labouring under this fever, and which were admitted into the di&s;pen&s;ary, only four have died, who were all in extreme danger at the time of their admi&s;&s;ion, and two of them &s;o much exhau&s;ted, as not to be able almo&s;t to take any medicine: viz. Margaret Storey, of Rickergate, a married woman, aged forty-two years, who died on the third day after admi&s;&s;ion; and Mary Wil&s;on, of Nan&s;on's lane, a child, aged three years, who died two days after admi&s;&s;ion. If we, therefore, omit the&s;e two, as ca&s;es already de&s;perate, ninety-five will remain, of which only two died, which is exactly one in forty-&s;even and one half. A circum&s;tance which &s;trongly marks the efficacy of the practice, and more e&s;pecially when it is con&s;idered, that almo&s;t the whole of the&s;e patients were confined, during their illne&s;s, in &s;mall, clo&s;e, dirty rooms, where, in &s;ome ca&s;es, &s;ix per&s;ons were ill at the &s;ame time; and &s;ome|times even three of them in one bed.</P>
<P>In the whole city nine per&s;ons died of this fever.</P>
<P>Before I conclude this part of my &s;ubject, I cannot omit ob&s;erving that the di&s;pen&s;ary has expended upwards of thirty pounds for wine, all of which was con&s;umed by per&s;ons affected with this di&s;ou&s;e.</P>
<P>Early in the month of December, 1784, the &s;mall pox were introduced by &s;ome vagrants, into the Dam&s;ide, Iri&s;h Gates, to the neighbourhood of which they were confined &s;ome time, but afterwards be|came general, and continued till the latter end of July, or beginning of Augu&s;t, when they entirely cea&s;ed. Eight patients affected with the natural &s;mall pox were admitted into the di&s;pen&s;ary in the month of January; eight in February; two in March; twenty-one in April; nine in May; and four in July; in all fifty-two; twelve of whom died. Total of deaths of this di&s;ea&s;e, thirty-nine, who were all under five years of age.</P>
<P>As one in four and one third died of all tho&s;e who were admitted into the di&s;pen&s;ary, it is highly pro|bable that of the whole number who laboured under the natural &s;mall pox, many of whom had not the lea&s;t advice or a&s;&s;i&s;tance, one in four would die, which makes the number affected, one hundred and fifty-&s;ix. As &s;oon as the di&s;ea&s;e made its appearance within the walls of the city, the monthly committee of the di&s;pen&s;ary re&s;olved, that a general inoculation of the poor inhabitants, agreeable to the plan which
<PB N="91" REF="102">I had propo&s;ed in the year 1783,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The &s;mall pox, both natural and from inoculation, being now pretty general in Carli&s;le, and likely to &s;pread &s;till further, the monthly committee of the Carli&s;le Di&s;pen&s;ary are of opinion, that a general inoculation of the poor and in|digent inhabitants will be attended with very beneficial effects.</P>
<P N="1">R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">SOLVED 1&s;t, That all &s;uch per&s;ons as come recommended by a &s;ub&s;criber, &s;hall be inoculated gratis at the di&s;pen|&s;ary.</P>
<P N="2">2d, That the &s;um of 2s. 6d. be given to the parents who are mo&s;t indigent, and who have three or more children inoculated, as a reward for nur&s;ing them properly during inoculation.</P>

<P N="4">4th, That the privilege of being inoculated at the di&s;pen&s;ary be continued for the &s;pace of two months, and no longer.</P></NOTE> &s;hould take place at the di&s;pen&s;ary, and it was with great plea&s;ure I ob&s;erved the prejudices of the vulgar again&s;t that mo&s;t &s;alutary invention, were greatly dimini&s;hed. For as &s;oon as the re&s;olution of the committee was made public by the common crier, great numbers from all quarters of the town flocked to the di&s;pen&s;ary, to reap the benefits which it held out to them. No le&s;s than ninety one were inoculated at the expence of the charity, and rather more than that number by the different practitioners. So that upon a moderate calculation, the whole number inoculated this year, amounted to two hundred; every one of whom not only recovered, but had the di&s;ea&s;e in a very favour|able manner. As we have &s;tated it as probable, that one in four died of the natural &s;mall pox, it is there|fore probable that fifty lives were &s;aved by this general inoculation; and if all tho&s;e affected in the natural way had been al&s;o inoculated, no le&s;s than eighty-nine lives would have been pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>During this year, 1 in 37 and 1-7th nearly, of all the inhabitants have died&mdash;See Table VII.</P>
<P>Apoplexies and paralytic &s;trokes were very frequent: no le&s;s than eight &s;uffered from the apoplexy.</P>
<P>As u&s;ual the number of deaths of hu&s;bands continues to exceed that of wives; twenty-nine hu&s;bands have died, and only twenty-five wives.&mdash;See Table VI.</P>
<P>Nine widowers, and twenty-one widows have died this year.&mdash;See Table VI.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons between the ages of ten and fifteen, and fifteen and twenty years, have been a&s;toni&s;hingly healthy, When I made the &s;urvey of Carli&s;le in the beginning of the year 1780, there were between ten and fifteen, &s;even hundred and fifteen; and between fifteen and twenty years of age, &s;ix hundred and &s;eventy-five per|&s;ons: in all, one thou&s;and three hundred and ninety. Since that period the inhabitants have unque&s;tion|ably increa&s;ed much: it is therefore very probable, that at pre&s;ent there are not le&s;s than one thou&s;and four hundred and fifty per&s;ons between the age of ten and twenty years, and yet of this number only two have died.&mdash;See Table V.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent year, however, &s;eems to have been fatal to old people, between eighty and ninety years of age, eight males and &s;ix females, five of whom were widows; and between ninety and an hundred, two males and four females have died.&mdash;See Table VI.</P>
<P>The number of males born greatly exceed the number of females; for, 148 males, and 119 females have been chri&s;tened.&mdash;See Table VIII.</P>
<P>FOR THE YEAR 1786.] Although we had not nearly &s;o much fro&s;t this year as the la&s;t, yet in other re&s;pects, the weather, during the pre&s;ent &s;pring and &s;ummer, greatly re&s;embled that of the year 1785. The winds, which were dry and cold, came chiefly from the ea&s;t during the whole of the months of March, April, and a part of May, which made the &s;pring late: and although the drought which &s;ucceeded was not of equal duration, yet it was much more inten&s;e, and con&s;equently the fields exhibited the &s;ame parched and arid appearance they had done the la&s;t &s;ummer. Refre&s;hing rains fell towards the middle of July: the autumn was fine; and a more mild and open winter was &s;eldom or ever remembered.</P>
<P>There was &s;carcely any difference in the &s;alubrity of the two years, two hundred and four per&s;ons dying the la&s;t, and two hundred and five in the pre&s;ent year. June, July, and Augu&s;t, which were the hotte&s;t months, were by far the mo&s;t healthy, for only twenty-four per&s;ons died during that period.&mdash;See Table IV.</P>
<P>On the contrary, October, November, and December, were the mo&s;t unhealthy, during which eighty-three deaths occurred: See Table IV.&mdash;This difference, however, did not &s;eem to proceed from any alteration of the atmo&s;phere, but from the mea&s;les, which were introduced into the town &s;ome time in Augu&s;t, and raged, during the&s;e three months, with the greate&s;t violence.</P>
<P>About two o'clock on Friday morning, Augu&s;t 11th, a &s;light &s;hock of an earthquake was very &s;en&s;ibly felt by many per&s;ons in Carli&s;le and the neighbourhood. Tho&s;e who were perfectly awake, or who hap|pened to be out of doors, report that the concu&s;&s;ion continued about four or five &s;econds; and that it was immediately preceded by a hollow tremulous &s;ound. Many were awakened out of their &s;leep, by the
<PB N="92" REF="103">&s;haking of their hou&s;es, beds, doors, and window &s;hutters. Birds in cages were likewi&s;e &s;en&s;ible of its influence, and fluttered as if greatly agitated and alarmed. Very providentially, however, little or no damage was &s;u&s;tained; a few chimneys and old walls were here and there thrown down, and three people in Whitehaven were thrown off their feet. But in other re&s;pects, a momentary fright and alarm were the only inconveniences which were &s;uffered from it. The concu&s;&s;ion &s;eemed to take its direction from the ea&s;t to the we&s;t, and extended quite acro&s;s the i&s;land, being felt both at Newea&s;tle and Whitehaven. And from the north towards the &s;outh, it extended from Gla&s;gow to the northern parts of Lanca&s;hire. The atmo&s;phere on Wedne&s;day and Thur&s;day preceding, was moi&s;t, gloomy, and &s;ultry; and &s;o much &s;o, on Thur&s;day night, that a lady, who was on a vi&s;it at Dal&s;ton, actually foretold when &s;he went to bed, that an earthquake would take place before morning. Friday was a very clear, hot, calm, &s;ultry, day.</P>
<P>Early in the &s;pring, the mea&s;les made their appearance in the &s;outh-we&s;t parts of Northumberland, where, I am informed, they proved very fatal. From thence they gradually advanced farther &s;outh, and the infection began to operate in Carli&s;le about the beginning of Augu&s;t: and as this epidemic had not vi&s;ited us &s;ince the year 1780, there mu&s;t con&s;equently have been a great number of children who were liable to be affected by the contagious matter generated by this di&s;order. Hence the infection &s;pread rapidly, and the di&s;ea&s;e &s;oon became general, and continued to rage till the latter end of December, or beginning of January, 1787, when it altogether di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding, however, the di&s;order was &s;o very general, yet its &s;ymptoms were extremely mild and favourable: for, of the great number who were affected, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e not le&s;s than &s;ix or &s;even hun|dred, only twenty-eight died, and the greater part of the&s;e were the children of the very poore&s;t and lowe&s;t cla&s;s of inhabitants, who were either too ignorant, or too ob&s;tinate to call in medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Of the twenty-eight who died, twenty-&s;ix were under five years of age, and two were between five and ten years old.</P>
<P>Another epidemic, viz. the chincough, occurred pretty early in the year, but this di&s;ea&s;e made little progre&s;s, until October, and even then did not become very general. Only nine children, who were all under five years of age, died of it, and &s;ome of tho&s;e were affected with the chincough and mea&s;les at the &s;ame time, and therefore probably &s;uffered from the joint effects of both.</P>
<P>During the pre&s;ent year, 1 in 37 and 5-6ths nearly, of all the inhabitants died in con&s;equence of di&s;ea&s;es.&mdash;See Table VII.</P>
<P>The number of deaths of hu&s;bands &s;till continues to exceed that of wives; twenty-four hu&s;bands have died, and only twenty-one wives.&mdash;See Table VI.</P>
<P>Between eighty and ninety years of age, one male and five females, who were all widows; and between ninety and an hundred, two widows have died.</P>
<P>A man who had long been a &s;oldier, and who mu&s;t con&s;equently have been &s;ubject to many varieties and vici&s;&s;itudes of life, died at the advanced age of 105.</P>
<P>FOR THE YEAR 1787.] In the beginning of January, 1780, the inhabitants of the two pari&s;hes of St. Mary's and St. Cuthbert's, Carli&s;le, were very accurately numbered by Mr. Stanger, Mr. Howard, and my&s;elf. At that period the&s;e pari&s;hes contained 3491 males, and 4186 females, in all 7677.</P>
<P>Sometime in the year 1787, an order was i&s;&s;ued from the court of Quarter Se&s;&s;ions, to the different con&s;tables in the county of Cumberland, to make an actual &s;urvey of all the inhabitants of the county. The &s;urvey was accordingly made at Carli&s;le in the latter end of December; but, as the motives which induced the magi&s;trates to i&s;&s;ue this order were not generally known, many gentlemen refu&s;ed to give an account of their families. The abbey, as being extraparochial, and the town&s;hip of Wreay, through &s;ome mi&s;take, were altogether omitted in this &s;urvey: hence it is evident, the li&s;ts delivered in to the Quarter Se&s;&s;ions are very erroneous.</P>
<P>I, however, had an opportunity of examining all the returns of the above pari&s;hes very minutely, and as the con&s;tables marked down the names of all tho&s;e per&s;ons who refu&s;ed to give them information, I was enabled to make up the deficiency, by procuring the numbers in each of their families, and I am per&s;uaded the enumeration is now pretty exact; but if there be any error, it will be on the &s;ide of defici|ency, rather than of exce&s;s.</P>
<P>From this &s;urvey, thus corrected, it appears that the two pari&s;hes of St. Mary's and St. Cutbbert's&punc; contain at pre&s;ent 3864 males, 4813 females, and con&s;equently 8677 inhabitants.&mdash;For a more particular account &s;ee Table III.</P>
<P>There has therefore been an increa&s;e, in the &s;pace of eight years, of a thou&s;and inhabitants; which is a circum&s;tance, that mu&s;t give great plea&s;ure to all tho&s;e who are well-wi&s;hers to the pro&s;perity of the city of Carli&s;le.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="104">From what cau&s;es, it may be a&s;ked, has this rapid increa&s;e ari&s;en? It affords me con&s;iderable &s;atis|faction to be able to inform the public, that it has principally been owing to two general cau&s;es, viz. <HI>The &s;alubrity of the place, and the increa&s;e of trade and manufactures.</HI> The former is clearly proved by the great exce&s;s of births above deaths; for, during the la&s;t eight years, the period in que&s;tion, 2071 children have been baptized, and only 1582 per&s;ons have been buried. The births, therefore, exceed the deaths 489. The latter, viz. <HI>the increa&s;e of trade and manufactures,</HI> is proved by an ingre&s;s of inhabitants into Carli&s;le, exceeding the emigration out of it, during the &s;ame period, 511; which numbers together make up the increa&s;e of 1000.</P>
<P>Inoculation, I am per&s;uaded, has al&s;o greatly contributed to the increa&s;e of population, not only in Carli&s;le, but likewi&s;e in the whole county of Cumberland. In the year 1779, when the lower cla&s;s of inhabitants were extremely aver&s;e to this &s;alutary di&s;covery, no fewer than ninety per&s;ons died of the na|tural &s;mall pox; whereas only 151 have died during the eight &s;ucceeding years; which is, upon an ave|rage, not quite nineteen in each year; and yet that di&s;order prevailed in every one of the&s;e years. (See all the bills of mortality which have been publi&s;hed.) Since that period, viz. 1779, the prejudices of the vulgar again&s;t inoculation, have greatly dimini&s;hed, and will &s;oon, I doubt not, be totally eradicated. And &s;ince the in&s;titution of the di&s;pen&s;ary, the poor have enjoyed the privilege of having their children inoculated gratis; an advantage which they have, in general, with great readine&s;s embraced.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t four months of the pre&s;ent year, greatly re&s;embled the beginning of the year 1779. The weather in both was remarkably mild and temperate, for there was &s;carce any fro&s;t in either. The com|mon dai&s;y was in full flower on new-year's-day, and continued in blo&s;&s;om almo&s;t the whole year: the Primro&s;e began to blow on the 1&s;t of February: and the Colt's-foot and Barren Strawberry very early in the &s;ame month: in &s;hort, all the early flowering plants were in full blow five or &s;ix weeks before their u&s;ual time. The &s;tate of the weather, however, throughout the year, was the rever&s;e of 1785 and 1786; the&s;e years were remarkably hot and dry; this was cold, gloomy, and uncommonly wet, in&s;omuch that there never was a year in which, probably, more rain fell than in the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The late Dr. Carlyle kept an accurate account of the quantity of rain which fell at Carli&s;le during a period of twenty years, viz. from the year 1757 to 1776 inclu&s;ive, which his &s;on, the Rev. Mr. Chancellor Carlyle, has been kind enough to communicate to me. During this period, the greate&s;t quantity which fell in any one year, was thirty-one inches and a few lines; and the medium depth of the&s;e years was only twenty four inches, eight lines and a half. Unfortunately, &s;ince 1776, no regular mea&s;ure has been taken at Carli&s;le; but Dr. Campbell, a very ingenious phy&s;ician at Lanca&s;ter, has &s;ent me a table of the quantity which fell at that place during the pre&s;ent year; and from which it appears, that it amounted to the almo&s;t incredible quantity of fifty-one inches and one line. The rain, therefore, which fell this year, is con&s;iderably above double the quantity which has fallen in any one year, on an average of twenty year's calculation, and exceeds, in quantity, twenty inches what fell in the wete&s;t of the above years. It mu&s;t, however, be ob&s;erved, that Lanca&s;ter is &s;ituated &s;omewhat nearer the we&s;tern ocean than Carli&s;le; and that the hills to the ea&s;t and north-ea&s;t of that place, are nearer it than the hills about Carli&s;le, which, in all probability, will make &s;ome difference in the quantity of rain which falls at each place.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the very great moi&s;ture of the atmo&s;phere, above related, yet the pre&s;ent year was a healthy one, and the la&s;t &s;ix months were remarkably &s;o; &s;eventy-three per&s;ons only died during that period.&mdash;See Table IV.</P>
<P>The &s;mall pox made their appearance in January, and were in Carli&s;le the greate&s;t part of the year; but inoculation &s;oon became general, which prevented the di&s;order from raging with any great degree of violence Thirty only died, twenty-eight of whom were under five years of age, and two between five and ten years. Eighty-four were inoculated at the di&s;pen&s;ary, all of whom not only &s;urvived, but had the di&s;order very favourably; and con&s;iderable numbers were likewi&s;e inoculated by &s;everal &s;urgeons in the town.</P>
<P>The putrid or jail fever al&s;o prevailed almo&s;t the whole year; but as it neither became general, nor malignant, till the beginning of 1788, I &s;hall at pre&s;ent only ob&s;erve, that fourteen per&s;ons fell victims to it.</P>
<P>The difference in the number of deaths of hu&s;bands and wives is this year very con&s;iderable; for thirty-four hu&s;bands have died, and only twenty two wives.&mdash;See Table VI.</P>
<P>Between eighty and ninety years of age, five males and five females, (the latter were widows;) and between ninety and one hundred, one male and two females have died.&mdash;See Table VI.</P>
<P>During the pre&s;ent year, only 1 in 44 nearly, of all the inhabitants have died in con&s;equence of di&s;ea&s;es;
<PB N="94" REF="105">and upon an average of the la&s;t nine years 1 in 39 and 1-4th has died.&mdash;See Table VII. It mu&s;t be re|marked in the fir&s;t place, that every infectious and epidemic di&s;ea&s;e, to which the human body is &s;ubject, (the plague excepted) prevailed during this period at Carli&s;le; and in the &s;econd place, that the calcula|tions were made for the fir&s;t eight years: from the number of inhabitants which exi&s;ted in the beginning of the year 1780, the great increa&s;e (of one thou&s;and) not being a&s;certained till the pre&s;ent year 1787. Therefore, although the deaths from accidents were not taken into the account for &s;everal of the fir&s;t years; yet, upon the whole, the mortality is &s;tated to be greater than it actually is.&mdash;See Table VII.</P>
<P>The deaths which occurred from accidents, were, in 1779, four; in 1780, three; in 1781, five; in 1782, four; in 1783, three; in 1784, five; in 1785, four; in 1786, two; and in 1787, two.</P>
<P>From table VII. it appears that the mo&s;t healthy period of human life is from ten to fifteen years of age, and that health declines in the following order, viz. between 20 and 30,&mdash;15 and 20,&mdash; 5 and 10,&mdash;30 and 40,&mdash;40 and 50,&mdash;50 and 60,&mdash;60 and 70,&mdash;under 5,&mdash;70 and 80,&mdash;80 and 90,&mdash;90 and 100. &mdash;See Table VII.</P>
<P>Table VIII. gives a connected view of all the chri&s;tenings and burials from 1779 to 1796, inclu&s;ive.</P>
<P>Dr. Hey&s;ham's tables of deaths and di&s;ea&s;es of per&s;ons of different ages are omitted, as wholly apper|taining to medical &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude the ob&s;ervations on the bills of mortality, with an account of a very curious and important circum&s;tance in phy&s;iology, which occurred at Carli&s;le during the pre&s;ent year. A child was born, apparent|ly at the full time, not only alive, but which lived and took nouri&s;hment &s;everal days, without the &s;malle&s;t ve&s;tige of a brain. In all my reading I do not recollect to have met with &s;o extraordinary a phenomenon; nor does it appear that Profe&s;&s;or Monro, who has &s;pent the greate&s;t part of his time in anatomical and phy&s;iological pur&s;uits, has either &s;een or read of any thing exactly &s;imilar. He has indeed, in his inge|nious ob&s;ervations on the &s;tructure and functions of the nervous &s;y&s;tem, publi&s;hed in 1783, favoured the world with &s;ome plates, which repre&s;ent the heads of two children, born at the full time, in which the bones which generally form the top of the cranium are wanting, and in which the brain, which is ex|tremely &s;mall, projects like an excre&s;cence. In the&s;e two in&s;tances, however, there was a &s;mall portion of brain in each, and though both the children are &s;tated to have been born at the full time, yet it does not appear that they were even born alive, much le&s;s that they lived any time after birth; for, if either had been the ca&s;e, we cannot &s;uppo&s;e that a gentleman of Dr. Monro's great accuracy, would have omitted circum&s;tances &s;o remarkable; but I think we may, on the contrary, infer from his &s;ilence, and from the following conclu&s;ions, which he him&s;elf draws from the above-mentioned mon&s;trous productions, and which I &s;hall take the liberty of quoting, as the work is not in every per&s;on's hands, that they were really born dead:&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>Nay we may, perhaps, go a &s;tep farther, and doubt whether, in&s;tead of con&s;idering the brain as the origin of the nerves, we ought not to con&s;ider it merely as connected with the nerves: or whether there are better rea&s;ons for &s;uppo&s;ing the brain to produce the nerves, than for &s;uppo&s;ing the nerves to pro|duce the brain. Some facts, at lea&s;t, may be here ob&s;erved, which &s;eem to &s;hew that the nerves may exi&s;t, independent of the brain.</Q></P>
<P N="1"><Q>I. In children delivered at the full time, plump and well formed in their trunk and limbs, I have ob&s;erved the &s;ub&s;tance which &s;upplied the place of the brain, not more bulky than a &s;mall nut; and, in&s;tead of containing a white medullary &s;ub&s;tance, it was of a red colour, re&s;embling a clot of blood: and &s;mall cords, occupying the place of the optic nerves, were likewi&s;e of a red colour. Yet the &s;pinal marrow, and all the nerves from it, had the ordinary &s;ize and appearance.</Q></P>
<P N="2"><Q>II In a mon&s;trous kitten, with two bodies and the appearance of one head, I found the &s;pinal mar|row of one of the bodies connected with a brain and cerebellum of the common &s;hape and &s;ize. But the &s;pinal marrow of the other body, though equally large, had only a &s;mall button of medullary &s;ub&s;tance at its upper end, without a &s;uitable brain or cerebellum.</Q>

The colour of this &s;ub&s;tance was a dark reddi&s;h brown, and upon examining it more particularly, I thought I could perceive the divi&s;ion of the two hemi&s;pheres of the brain, and likewi&s;e the divi&s;ion of the cerebrum from the cerebellum. I gently rai&s;ed with my fingers, a part of it which projected over the integuments, which made the child cry, and produced a con&s;iderable &s;tarting, &s;imilar to what is occa&s;ioned by an electric &s;hock. The child was full grown, and &s;eemed in perfect health, her limbs were plump, firm, and well proportioned, and &s;he moved them with apparent agility. The external organs of &s;en&s;e were al&s;o perfect. She &s;wallowed well, and took a &s;ufficient quantity of nouri&s;hment for &s;everal days, but &s;ometimes during the action of &s;wallowing &s;tarted a little. She lived till five o'clock on Sunday morning, June the 1&s;t, when &s;he expired Some time before her death &s;he was affected with flight convul&s;ions. During the three or four days preceding her death, there was a con&s;tant di&s;charge of a thin watery fluid, &s;omewhat tinged with blood, from the excre&s;cence, which greatly dimini&s;hed its bulk; for at her death, it was only about half the &s;ize of what it had been when &s;he was born, and the &s;urface was, in &s;ome places, beginning to put on an appearance of mortification.</P>
<P>A few hours after her death, Dr. Blamire, and Mr. Charles Fari&s;h, accompanied me to the hou&s;e, where Dr. Blamire very cautiou&s;ly di&s;&s;ected, away from the bones, the whole of the &s;ub&s;tance; when we found the greate&s;t part of the frontal, the temporal, the occipital, and the whole of the parietal bones wanting. The &s;ub&s;tance removed was then carefully examined, and what was our a&s;toni&s;hment to find it entirely to con&s;i&s;t of membranes, blood-ve&s;&s;els, but principally of &s;everal bags; one of which was as large as a nut-meg, the re&s;t of different &s;izes, but much &s;maller. They were all filled with a browni&s;h coloured fluid; which, when the cy&s;ts were punctured, gu&s;hed out with &s;ome violence.</P>
<P>There was not the lea&s;t appearance of cerebrum, cerebellum, or any medullary &s;ub&s;tance whatever. The &s;pinal marrow had a natural appearance, but did not &s;eem to have been connected with the parts above de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Having accurately related the facts as they appeared to Dr. Blamire and my&s;elf, which for their &s;ingularity de&s;erve to be recorded; I think the few following obvious inferences may be drawn from them 1. That the fluid di&s;charged from the excre&s;cence during the life of the infant, and which produced the great dimi|nution of its bulk, was occa&s;ioned by the rupture, or ero&s;ion of cy&s;ts, &s;imilar to tho&s;e which remained &s;ound and full of water after death. 2d, That the living principle, the nerves of the trunk, and extremities, &s;en&s;ation and motion, may exi&s;t independent of, and that the natural, vital, and animal functions, may be performed without the brain. And as the external organs of &s;en&s;e, viz. the eyes, the no&s;e, the tongue, and the ears, all &s;eemed perfect; may we not, therefore, &s;uppo&s;e, that the optic, the olfactory, the gu&s;ta|tory, and the auditory nerves, may exi&s;t independent of, and unconnected with either the brain or &s;pinal marrow?</P>
<P>I content my&s;elf with little more than de&s;cribing this extraordinary ca&s;e, and leave to others to deduce from it, &s;uch conclu&s;ions as the appearances ob&s;erved may be thought to warrant.</P>
<P>FOR THE YEAR 1796.] In the month of April, this year, a &s;urvey, under the direction of the editors, was made by Mr. John&s;ton, a per&s;on of accuracy and attention, who found that the two pari&s;hes of St. Mary and St. Cuthbert contained 1587 hou&s;es, 2616 families, and 10,289 inhabitants. It therefore appears that the increa&s;e &s;ince 1780 has been 2612; and &s;ince 1787, 1612.&mdash;For a more particular ac|count of the different &s;urveys which have been made, &s;ee Tables I. and III.</P>

<HEAD>The State of Agriculture in the two Pari&s;hes of St. Mary and St. Cuthbert.</HEAD>
<P>EXTBNT.] North and &s;outh about five miles and a half; ea&s;t and we&s;t about three miles.</P>
<P>SOIL AND PRODUCE.] The &s;oil is very different in quality and fertility: a &s;andy or gravelly loam prevails in the vicinage of Carli&s;le and Carleton: a loam, in which clay predominates, is found in mo&s;t other parts of the&s;e pari&s;hes, particularly about Botchardby Harraby, Uprightby, Blackhall, and mo&s;t parts of the chapel of Wreay. About Cumer&s;dale, a greyi&s;h &s;oil covers a &s;tratum of clay. Towards the &s;outhern and we&s;tern extremities, are con&s;iderable tracts of moori&s;h &s;oils, which, not many years ago, were very barren commons; but which, by inclo&s;ure and proper management, are now generally in a pro|gre&s;&s;ive &s;tate of improvement.</P>
<P>Land near Carli&s;le is chiefly applied to the purpo&s;es of dairying, breeding and feeding &s;heep, growing hay for hor&s;es, &amp;c. Wheat is the principal grain cultivated upon the be&s;t &s;trong &s;oils; a fallow gene|rally precedes. On &s;oils having a con&s;iderable portion of land, turnips, barley, and clover, or other artificial gra&s;&s;es, are beginning to be much &s;own, which is found to be a very profitable &s;y&s;tem. Pota|toes form a con&s;iderable article of cultivation in the&s;e pari&s;hes. On the late inclo&s;ed commons, oats is the mo&s;t prevailing crop: that grain al&s;o has its turn in the cour&s;e of hu&s;bandry in more fertile di&s;tricts, as have pea&s;e and beans. I am &s;orry to add, that the barbarous and unprofitable &s;y&s;tem of taking two or more white crops in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, though yearly lo&s;ing ground, has yet its advocates here The great quantity of manure made at Carli&s;le, fertilizes the &s;oil in the neighbourhood; and the crops are generally abundant. Gra&s;s ground increa&s;e, while that in tillage dimini&s;hes.</P>
<P>RENT.] Within half a mile of Carli&s;le, is from 3l. to 5l. 10s. per acre. In old inclo&s;ures, and pretty good &s;oils at a greater di&s;tance, from 1l. to about 2l. 10s. There are, however, &s;ome farms, where the &s;oil is unfertile, that do not fetch above 10s. per acre.</P>
<P>So great is the improvement of land in the&s;e pari&s;hes that, I was told, ground which did not bring more than 8s. per acre, forty years ago, is now let from 2l. to 3l. 10s. per acre. It was at that period in common field.</P>
<P>SHEEP AND CATTLE.] About five hundred or &s;ix hundred &s;heep may be kept here, which are mo&s;tly of the &s;hort legged, long wooled breed. The &s;tanding &s;tocks are improving in finene&s;s of bone and wool, and inclination to feed, by tups of the improved breed from the &s;tocks of Mr. Culley, and other eminent &s;heep-breeders in Northumberland.</P>
<P>Mr. Porter of Carli&s;le ranks among the fir&s;t who introduced that profitable breed into Cumberland, and is now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a valuable &s;tock, which depa&s;ture upon the Swifts. Cattle are generally of the be&s;t Cumberland breeds; but the cow keepers about Carli&s;le &s;eem to prefer the &s;hort horned, or Dutch &s;ort; &s;ome of which, when properly fed, afford a very great quantity of milk. There are in&s;tances of &s;ome giving forty quarts per day (wine mea&s;ure) for a few weeks after calving; thirty quarts is not very uncommon, and twenty-four frequent. She is, however, e&s;teemed a good cow, that affords from &s;ixteen to twenty quarts of milk per day for great part of the &s;ummer. The&s;e cows are fed with the mo&s;t luxu|riant gra&s;s in &s;ummer, hay in winter, and generally grains or potatoes every day in the year. The expence
<PB N="97" REF="108">of feeding is heavy: but the mo&s;t experienced cow keepers have found that the great &s;ecret of profit|ing by cows, is to &s;elect the be&s;t milkers, either of the Dutch, Lanca&s;hire, or Galloway breeds, and to feed them with &s;ufficient quantities of the be&s;t food. That however, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, is a practice not much followed in mo&s;t other parts of this county.</P>
<P>RIVERS AND FISH.] The Eden, Caldew, and Petterel, water the&s;e pari&s;hes. The&s;e rivers abound with trout, eel, and other &s;orts of &s;mall fi&s;h, common in the country. In the Eden large quantities of &s;almon are caught. The waters of Caldew and Petterel, and particularly the former, are remarkable for the quality of bleaching white. It is rather an unplea&s;ant reflection, that the&s;e rapid &s;treams, &s;o peculiarly adapted to the purpo&s;e of turning machinery for miles above Carli&s;le, more particularly the Caldew: and by a proper application of which, that city might be rendered almo&s;t the Birmingham of the north, &s;hould only be employed in giving motion to three or four &s;olitary corn mills, and a few cotton works.</P>
<P>THE KING-GARTH FISHERY.] A little below Cargo, is the King-Garth fi&s;hery, which the corpora|tion of Carli&s;le, held under the charter of Edward III. and having given ri&s;e to a &s;ubject of &s;ome notoriety in this part of the county, a few years ago, it may not be ami&s;s here to give a &s;hort account of it.</P>
<P>An eye draught of the <HI>Stell Fi&s;heries</HI> at King-garth.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>A. The main river of Eden, formerly a &s;mall &s;tream, called the <HI>Gut</HI> or <HI>Goat.</HI></P>
<P>B. Where the &s;tells cro&s;&s;ed the river.</P>
<P>C. The ancient main cour&s;e of the river, where the &s;tells were formerly placed, now dried up, called King-Garth.</P>
<P>D. King-Garth fi&s;hhou&s;e.</P>
<P>E. Carbed.</P>
<P>F. Cargo-Holm.</P>
<P>This fi&s;hery of the corporation (being a <HI>&s;everal fi&s;hery</HI>) extended only acro&s;s the &s;tream, between Cargo-holm and Carbed, and &s;o hath been lo&s;t, by the river altering its cour&s;e many years ago. The fi&s;hery in that part of the river where the &s;tell was lately placed, belonged to Lord Lon&s;dale; and was, till lately, under lea&s;e to the corporation. The device for catching fi&s;h, called a <HI>Stell,</HI> u&s;ed by the le&s;&s;ees of the corporation, was a net acro&s;s the water, tied to &s;takes drove in for that purpo&s;e, which caught or &s;topped mo&s;t of the &s;almon; it being only in high floods that any could get pa&s;t it: by tho&s;e means the other fi&s;heries higher up the river, were become of trifling value.</P>
<P>For remedy whereof, an action was commenced, in the year 1783, by the owners of tho&s;e other fi&s;heries, again&s;t the le&s;&s;ees of the corporation upon the &s;tatute 2d. Hen. VI. chap. 15th. (which &s;tatute expre&s;sly prohibits the &s;tanding of nets fa&s;tened to po&s;ts, continually day and night, overthwart the river Thames, and other rivers of the realm: under the penalty of 100 &s;hillings for every offence).&mdash;This action came to a hearing at the a&s;&s;izes at Carli&s;le, the &s;ame year, before judge Buller; when a verdict was given for the plaintiff: and which, on a new trial the year following, was confirmed. Since which, that fi&s;hery hath been occupied by Lord Lon&s;dale's agents, in the u&s;ual way of nets drawn by hands.</P>
<P>It may be ob&s;erved, that, this matter was about being brought to a legal deci&s;ion, about fifty years ago, when the double pa&s;&s;age in the river occa&s;ioned the difficulty of obtaining redre&s;s, in regard the nets not being entirely <HI>overthwart</HI> the &s;ame, within the de&s;cription and meaning of the act.</P>
<P>The corporation are al&s;o entitled to a <HI>free fi&s;hery</HI> (generally called a <HI>boat fi&s;hery</HI>) in this river, which was granted by the charter of Edward IV.</P>
<P>There are from this part of the river up to Carli&s;le, about &s;eventeen other boat fi&s;hings, belonging to at lea&s;t, as many different proprietors; the annual value of which are various, between 6l. and 40l. each, and upwards.</P>
<P>ROADS.] Are tolerably good. Two old fa&s;hioned narrow &s;tone bridges, over two branches of the Eden connect Carli&s;le with Stanwix. Caldewgate is al&s;o connected with Carli&s;le by two &s;tone bridges over as many branches of the Caldew. Two roads, the one from the &s;outh and the other from the ea&s;t, cro&s;s the Petterel; and at each place there is a &s;tone bridge. The road from London to Edinburgh, and that from Whitehaven to Newca&s;tle, inter&s;ect the&s;e pari&s;hes in different directions.</P>
<P>FUEL.] Is chiefly coal from Tindale-fell.</P>
<NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>* Since the la&s;t page was printed off, we were credibly informed the number of &s;heep kept in the&s;e two pari&s;hes, is about</HI> 1600.</NOTE>
<P><PB N="98" REF="109">GAME.] Are hares and partridges.</P>
<P>QUARRIES AND BUILDINGS.] In the&s;e pari&s;hes are excellent free&s;tone quarries in different places. Tho&s;e of mo&s;t note are on the Petterel near Newbiggin, and tho&s;e near Durdare and Burnthwaite.&mdash;No lime&s;tone. Near Quarrygate is a vein or quarry of alaba&s;ter, or gyp&s;um. Buildings are generally pretty good, and covered with blue or red &s;tate: a few hou&s;es are yet thatched, and &s;ome are even built with clay walls.</P>
<P>TITHES.] A con&s;iderable part of the&s;e pari&s;hes pay tithes in kind; and a portion pay a modus in lieu thereof.</P>
<P>SCHOOL.] At Blackhall, a donation amounting annually to 5l. 8s. was left by the late Thomas Lowry, E&s;q. of Blackhall, for the education of &s;even poor children.</P>
<P>WOODS AND PLANTATIONS.] The banks of Caldew are cloathed with wood, principally oak; &s;ome &s;mall plots of woodland appear in other parts, and a few trees grow on hedge-rows. Several hundred acres of the mo&s;t barren parts of the common, when they were inclo&s;ed, were planted with fore&s;t trees, and chiefly Scotch fir: they have &s;ucceeded beyond the expectation of every one, and now not only beautify the country, and &s;helter the farms in the neighbourhood, but will ultimately prove very profitable to the proprietors. Rearing of wood is the mo&s;t profitable way of applying mo&s;t barren &s;oils.</P>
<P>ASPECT AND GENERAL APPEARANCE.] Though this di&s;trict contains many irregular, but gentle &s;wells; it is as level, and perhaps more &s;o, than mo&s;t parts of the county: the general inclination is to|wards the north, but &s;mall.</P>
<P>The exten&s;ive vales, formed by the Eden, the Caldew and Petterel, are level, fertile, and beautiful; they incircle Carli&s;le, which ri&s;es on a gentle eminence in the centre, and commands a plea&s;ant pro&s;pect of the adjacent country. Among other delightful views which appear from that city, the neat hou&s;e, gardens, &amp;c. of William Richard&s;on, E&s;q. at Rickerby, are &s;een beyond the verdant fields through which the Eden winds its way, and forms an excellent object.</P>
<P>Mr. Lo&s;h of Wood&s;ide is making every thing &s;mile round him: his hou&s;e, his garden, his farms, are almo&s;t daily under his improving hands: land too barren for tillage he plants with wood. Between Wood&s;ide and Durdare is a tract of very poor ground, divided, but not inclo&s;ed, nor cultivated: Mr. Lo&s;h has lately purcha&s;ed a &s;mall part thereof for 2l. 10s. per acre, inclo&s;ed and planted it with fore&s;t trees: the other proprietors, it appears, have not yet di&s;covered how much it would be to their advantage, either to di&s;po&s;e of their &s;hares to Mr. Lo&s;h; or follow his example in turning them to profit.</P>
<P>COUNTY GAOL AT CARLISLE.] Is old, much out of repair, and without the regular means of &s;up|plying the different rooms with fre&s;h air, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary in the&s;e wretched receptacles of guilt and misfor|tune. The celebrated Mr. Howard de&s;cribes it as follows:&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>The court &s;pacious, 85 yards by 36: it was common to all pri&s;oners; but now a part is appropri|ated to the felons, and &s;eparated by iron pali&s;ades. In the court is a chapel, built as appears by the date, in 1734. Five rooms for ma&s;ter &s;ide debtors: and as many on the common &s;ide. Mo&s;t of the latter are large, but have windows to the &s;treet. Where there are &s;o many rooms, not to &s;eparate the men and women is certainly inexcu&s;able.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The wards for felons are two rooms, down a &s;tep or two; dark and dirty. One of them, the day room, had a window to the &s;treet; through which &s;pirituous liquors, and tools for mi&s;chief, might be ea&s;ily conveyed: but it is now bricked up: the night room is only 11 feet by 9. At my la&s;t vi&s;it, <HI>men</HI> and <HI>women</HI> were lodged together in it.
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The men and women felons are now confined in &s;eparate apartments.</NOTE> Two rooms over the felons' wards, which have been u&s;ed as tap rooms, &s;eem to be intended for the <HI>women</HI> only,
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">They are now appropriated to that purpo&s;e.</NOTE> but in <HI>one</HI> of the&s;e I al&s;o found <HI>three men,</HI> and four <HI>women,</HI> lodged together. No infirmary. Tran&s;ports had not the allowance of two &s;hillings and &s;ixpence a week. Clau&s;es again&s;t &s;pirituous liquors, and act for pre&s;erving the health of pri&s;oners, not hung up. Gaol delivery <HI>once</HI> a year. Few gaols have &s;o many convenient rooms for common &s;ide debtors. It is the more remarkable here, becau&s;e there is <HI>no table</HI> &s;igned by the magi&s;|trates, to particularize the free wards. Some gaolers avail them&s;elves of &s;uch a circum&s;tance, and demand rent for rooms which were undoubtedly de&s;igned for common &s;ide pri&s;oners.</Q></P>
<P>The furniture is provided by the pri&s;oners, and is generally wretched in the extreme. Mr. Mullinder, the pre&s;ent gaoler, &s;eems, however, to keep the different apartments as clean and comfortable as circum|&s;tances will admit. The rooms and pa&s;&s;ages are whitewa&s;hed once a year; and the felons' rooms (wholly compo&s;ed of &s;tone) cleaned of all noxious matter, by burning a large quantity of &s;traw upon the floor, &s;o that di&s;orders rarely prevail there. We would, however, recommend a more frequent u&s;e of lime as a wa&s;h: being convinced, that, nothing is more conducive to the prevention, or eradication of infections.&mdash;The pri&s;oners have an opportunity of purcha&s;ing milk and vegetables, every day, in
<PB N="99" REF="110">great plenty. No ale nor &s;pirits are now &s;old in the gaol: and it is much to be wi&s;hed that intoxica|ting liquors were very &s;paringly allowed to be brought therein.</P>
<P>The magi&s;trates for the county have had it in contemplation, the&s;e &s;everal years, to build a new goal, in the ca&s;tle-green: and have prepared a large quantity of &s;tones for the purpo&s;e: a &s;ituation we can|not too much recommend: but from what rea&s;on the de&s;ign is not forwarded, we are not informed.</P>
