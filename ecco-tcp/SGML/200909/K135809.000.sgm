<HEAD>TO THE MEMBERS OF THE PRESBYTE|RIAN CHURCH, RESIDING AT ALEX|ANDRIA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Friends and Brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>DISCOURSES, immediately for your u&s;e, naturally claim your protection. Any publication in the form of <HI>Sermons</HI> may be laid a&s;ide by many with|out examination. With the name &s;omething forbidding is connected. My &s;entiments on this intere&s;ting &s;ubject might have been conveyed under another form. This is the mo&s;t familiar. It al&s;o admits great variety. Sober minds do not reject a dre&s;s which is decent, and fit for the &s;ea&s;on, becau&s;e it is not altogether fa&s;hi|onable.</P>
<P>The propriety of di&s;cu&s;&s;ing a &s;ubject which has al|ready been fully repeatedly, and in the mo&s;t ma&s;terly manner di&s;cu&s;&s;ed may be doubted. The &s;ea&s;on &s;eemed to require it. If infidelity triumph, the triumph mu&s;t be &s;topped. I offer nothing entirely new: neither do I offer a compilation. I have examined the &s;ub|ject carefully. You have my own reflections on it nor have I refu&s;ed the reflections of others. A&s;|&s;i&s;tance from any quarter was cheerfully received.</P>
<P><HI>"The Age of Rea&s;on"</HI> di&s;covers great igno|rance of the &s;ubject which it pretends to illu&s;trate, and an utter contempt for revelation, and for all its advocates. It would be very ea&s;y to take the book,
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
page by page, and to e&s;tabli&s;h fully all the&s;e charges. A di&s;putatious &s;pirit had led to &s;uch a tract. For di&s;putation I have no ta&s;te; my only wi&s;h is to pro|mote the truth. To oppo&s;e &s;corn to &s;corn, appears to me very improper on &s;o &s;erious a &s;ubject. I lay down certain principles, and &s;hew how the&s;e may be applied. Either this vain book is full of groundle&s;s a&s;&s;ertions and bla&s;phemous boa&s;ting, or the principles which I have attempted to e&s;tabli&s;h are entirely fal&s;e. I can, for my own part, as &s;oon doubt my own exi&s;tence as the&s;e princeples. I am not &s;ingular in this; many to whom I addre&s;s my&s;elf have the &s;ame conviction, and few can bring them&s;elves to believe that, that con|viction is illu&s;ive. If the faith of the one be confirmed, and the doubts of the other removed, I &s;hall not think my labour has been lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Inelegancies might have been avoided by omitting ob&s;ervations &s;ugge&s;ted by the &s;tate of my immediate charge, and the occurrences of the moment; but as my aim is u&s;efulne&s;s rather than elegance, I have ventured the following di&s;cour&s;es abroad in their na|tive dre&s;s, without any attempt to modernize them.</P>
<P>I offer them to my pa&s;toral charge as an evidence of my concern for their welfare.</P>
<P>Should &s;ome copies of the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es find their way among tho&s;e, in the i&s;land of Burmuda, for whom I once laboured, let my old friends know the tender de|&s;ire which I &s;till entertain for their welfare, and the &s;atisfaction which I &s;hould feel in being &s;till able to promote that in any way.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="4">I think my&s;elf entitled to the prayers of my people, that this work, thro' the divine ble&s;&s;ing, may be ac|cepted by the public, and u&s;eful to the chri&s;tian cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tianity proceeding from God mu&s;t &s;tand. No weapon formed for its de&s;truction &s;hall pro&s;per. Boldly therefore I leave my own charge, and the chri&s;tian church in general, on the guardian care and the enriching ble&s;&s;ing of our Divine Redeemer.</P>

<P>Wi&s;dom crieth without; &s;he uttereth her voice in the &s;treets. She crieth in the chief place of con|cour&s;e, in the openings of the gates: in the city &s;he uttereth her words, &s;aying, How long, ye &s;imple ones, will ye love &s;implicity? and the &s;corners de|light in their &s;corning? and fools hate knowledge?

<P>SOLOMON expo&s;tulates in the&s;e words with irreligious per&s;ons on their conduct. Their conduct is &s;poken of as <HI>&s;imple, &s;cornful</HI> and <HI>fooli&s;h:</HI> It is oppo&s;ed to the dictates of wi&s;dom deliver|ed in the mo&s;t articulate, the mo&s;t public, the mo&s;t commanding manner. It has nothing to recommend it, no rea&s;on therefore can ju&s;tify per&s;i&s;ting therein: renouncing it, has immediate and great advantages. I &s;hall, thro' divine a&s;|&s;i&s;tance,
<PB N="8" REF="6">
attempt the illu&s;tration of each of the&s;e particulars.</P>
<P>Expo&s;tulating with the irreligious on their con|duct, Solomon &s;peaks of it&mdash;1&s;t. As <HI>&s;imple, &s;corn|ful</HI> and <HI>fooli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>The conduct of irreligious per&s;ons is declared to be <HI>&s;imple.</HI> "Ye &s;imple ones." Sadly they impo&s;e upon them&s;elves. Others fear God, and are directed and re&s;trained by his law: They ca&s;t off this fear, and will &s;ubmit neither to its direction nor re&s;traint. Let vulgar minds act under &s;uch influence. They are more di&s;cerning. Their own rea&s;on is a &s;ufficient guide. The world has hitherto been mi&s;led, di&s;covering the error; they are for the future to think and act for them&s;elves. No doubt the&s;e are the people, and wi&s;dom &s;hall die with them. They <HI>deny</HI> what others firmly <HI>believe;</HI> deride what others vene|rate; throw off the yoke which others know has been impo&s;ed by the Creator. In this there is a boldne&s;s of a &s;ingular kind. It is the bold|ne&s;s of the child who handles unwarily the keen-edged-in&s;trument, who &s;eizes, undaunted the en|venomed viper; or who walks heedle&s;s on the dangerous precipice. That religion has been mi&s;ta|ken, and abu&s;ed, is not to be denied. Impute not this to religion, but to human weakne&s;s and degeneracy: u&s;e it as an inducement to be more deligent in inve&s;tigating the &s;ubject; but let it not drop neglected and contemned. There is
<PB N="9" REF="7" MS="y">
in the heart, &s;uch enmity to God, that men avail them&s;elves of whatever appears able to ju&s;tify them in ca&s;ting off his fear and &s;ervice. Such conduct is &s;poken of in my text as very contemp|tible. Men act not in &s;o &s;imple a manner in the affairs of this world; they weigh worldly matters well, and decide prudently; but in religion a &s;u|perficial attention only is given, and conclu&s;ions of a mo&s;t erroneous kind are drawn. Scornful is the conduct of the irreligious, as well as the <HI>&s;imple.</HI> There is a gradual progre&s;s in a &s;inful cour&s;e. Men proceed not at once to extremes. From walking in the coun&s;el of the ungodly, from &s;tand|ing in the way of &s;inners, they venture to &s;it in the chair of the &s;cornful. Religion is turned into ri|dicule. It is attacked by &s;coffs and jeers; at hours the mo&s;t unguarded it is called for, as Samp&s;on was, to encrea&s;e men's mirth; making a mock at &s;in, as nothing new. Sinners have often treat|ed God's threatnings and judgments with con|tempt. Look back O &s;corners, to him who intro|duced this practice, and boa&s;t of it, if you think well; the Devil heads the wretched band, he fir&s;t turned God's word into ridicule. Darkning very plain words, by arguments of a more &s;ubtle kind, he effectually deceived our fir&s;t parents, and betrayed them into a conduct the mo&s;t fatal to them&s;elves, and to their decendants. To this &s;ource the &s;op|hi&s;try in &s;ucceeding ages, which has proved &s;o prejudicial to religion, may be traced. The mo&s;t degenerate natures are the mo&s;t given to u&s;e this vile artifice, in order to di&s;credit, and, if po&s;&s;ible,
<PB N="10" REF="8">
to undermine religion. The narrations, the doc|trines, the characters, found in &s;cripture, are viewed with a jaundiced eye; and fal&s;hood being &s;ub&s;tituted for truth, ignorance for knowledge, a &s;uperficial glance for an accurate examination, what is mo&s;t &s;acred, mo&s;t venenerable, and mo&s;t u&s;eful is expo&s;ed in a fool's coat, to the deri&s;ion of the incon&s;iderate; I cannot conceive what &s;atisfaction can be derived from &s;uch a practice; yet, alas! it is too common, and its baneful in|fluence &s;everely felt.</P>
<P>Fooli&s;h is the conduct of irreligious per&s;ons, as well as <HI>&s;imple</HI> and &s;cornful. The fool hates knowledge. The ear of the wi&s;e is open to in&s;truc|tion. Its voice, from any quarter is attended unto. Confirmed, indeed, mu&s;t he be in wickedne&s;s, who will not li&s;ten to the dictates of wi&s;dom. To this men proceed by the &s;teps already pointed out. It is the &s;ummit of degeneracy. There is hope as long as men are teachable. Hating knowledge; the &s;ymptoms are of the very wor&s;t kind. Rich were the Laodiceans in their own conceit, in a re|ligious view, and increa&s;ed with goods, and hav|ing need of nothing: whil&s;t Infinite Wi&s;dom knew them to be "wretched, and mi&s;erable, and poor, and blind, and naked." Rich is the infidel, if we take his word for it, and increa&s;ed with goods, and having need of nothing. He is &s;ettled in his opinion, and believes the foundation on which he re&s;ts firm as the everla&s;ting hills; but God knows that he is wretched, and mi&s;erable, and poor, and blind, and naked. He is &s;porting on a precipice.
<PB N="11" REF="9">
He is the pri&s;oner of ju&s;tice. The &s;entence is in|curred; it &s;hall pa&s;s, it &s;hall be executed to his &s;ur|pri&s;e, and ruin. Such act under a judicial blindne&s;s. Nothing can be more infatuated. Per&s;uade the madman, fettered down in his cell, of his &s;ituation &mdash;it cannot be done: he believes him&s;elf a prince, inve&s;ted with the in&s;ignia of royalty; having at his command all the plea&s;ures of a court: &s;uch the infidel. He is &s;unk into a fatal &s;ecurity, from which he cannot be rou&s;ed.</P>
<P>As the conduct of irreligious per&s;ons is re|pre&s;ented by Solomon, in his expo&s;tulations with them, as <HI>&s;imple, &s;cornful,</HI> and <HI>fooli&s;h,</HI> it is al&s;o repre&s;ented,</P>
<P N="2">II. As oppo&s;ed to the dictates of wi&s;dom, de|livered in the mo&s;t articulate, the mo&s;t public, the mo&s;t commanding manner: <HI>Wi&s;dom crieth without; &s;he uttereth her voice in the &s;treets; &s;he crieth in the chief place of concour&s;e; in the openings of the gates: in the city &s;he uttereth her words.</HI></P>
<P>Wi&s;dom here is expre&s;&s;ive of the&s;e prudent coun&s;els which men repeatedly have from con|&s;cience, from providence, and from &s;cripture. Their language is di&s;tinct and faithful. It is heard amid&s;t the noi&s;e of bu&s;ine&s;s, and the croud of company; it &s;ounds in our ears, in the &s;treets, or at the gate, at home, or abroad. The cry of wi&s;dom cannot be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. Folly &s;eeks the &s;hade and lurks in darkne&s;s; it whi&s;pers in the
<PB N="12" REF="10">
ear its impiety, and communicates, &s;ecretly, its poi&s;on to the heart. Wi&s;dom is open and impor|tunate; no noi&s;e can drown its voice, no bu&s;ine&s;s, private or public, re&s;train its reproof. Let the &s;in|ner fly, it follows him: let him &s;tep to the right hand, or to the left, the voice behind him cannot be &s;ilenced. It proclaims di&s;tinctly, <HI>This is the way, walk ye in it.</HI> It teaches and reproves; it gives correction and in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s. A|larming was it to Adam, when he had di&s;obeyed God. It di&s;turbed him in his un&s;afe retreat, and brought him to judgment. Judas could not bear its terrors: It made Felix tremble on the bench: It filled Bell&s;hazzar and his nobles with con&s;ter|nation, when rioting at an impious fe&s;tival; and rendered even Herod pen&s;ive and unea&s;y, in the exerci&s;e of arbitrary and unju&s;t authority. When a &s;ecret intimation awakes a dread that the unbe|liever may be wrong, or the unholy be &s;ubjected to puni&s;hment; when overwhelmed with di&s;tre&s;s, they are unhappy, having no anchor by which they may weather out the &s;torm, no hope to buoy them up. When the word of truth pierces their hearts, and leaves this impre&s;&s;ion, that being out of the way, they are greatly expo&s;ed. In either, in all of the&s;e ca&s;es, we have a &s;pecimen of the exertions of wi&s;dom to draw mankind from er|ror, and thereby to prevent their ruin.</P>
<P>The conduct of irreligious per&s;ons being &s;im|ple, &s;cornful, and fooli&s;h;&mdash;being oppo&s;ed to the dictates of wi&s;dom, delivered in the mo&s;t articu|late,
<PB N="13" REF="11" MS="y">
public and commanding manner, having nothing to recommend it. There is,</P>
<P N="3">III. No rea&s;on which can ju&s;tify the per&s;i&s;ting therein. "How long, ye &s;imple ones, will ye love &s;implicity? and the &s;corners delight in their &s;corning? and fools hate knowledge?" By interro|gations we may a&s;&s;ert in the &s;tronge&s;t manner. They leave the matter on the con&s;cience. The an|&s;wer is implied, and being &s;uppo&s;ed to come from the guilty per&s;on, is the more conclu&s;ive. The language of my text is thus forcible. It repre&s;ents the unaccountable folly and &s;tupidity of &s;inners, of which a moment's reflection mu&s;t convince them. Is it not abundantly verified that &s;uch men deceive them&s;elves?&mdash;And will you continue the cheat? Have you not acted long enough again&s;t rea&s;on and con&s;cience?&mdash;Why play the fool any longer? What plea&s;ure is there in &s;coffing at reli|gion? What wi&s;dom in turning from a prudent monitor? What prai&s;e in continuing in igno|rance?</P>
<P>Deceitful as the heart is, and de&s;perately wick|ed, few, I believe, are able altogether, to throw off religion. Even tho&s;e who have it in deri&s;ion, have it &s;o, becau&s;e it makes them unea&s;y, repro|bating their wicked practices; &s;eek relief in mak|ing as light of it as po&s;&s;ible, as the afflicted &s;ome|times &s;eek relief in intoxication. Thought may hereby be ab&s;orbed for the moment, but it recurs
<PB N="14" REF="12" MS="y">
with more &s;everity. Such the relief which infi|dels experience in their unwarrantable practices. They impo&s;e &s;ilence upon con&s;cience, but it will &s;peak, and thunder terrors into their ears. Religi|on is adapted to make us happy, and is congenial to the &s;oul; rejecting it, men determine that it &s;hall be the &s;ubject of their thoughts, and the rule of their lives at &s;ome future period. The young will think of it when they are old; the bu&s;y, when it may be convenient; the robu&s;t, when re|duced by &s;ickne&s;s: no determination can be more unwi&s;e. To act upon it is to act in a manner highly infatuated. Let us rea&s;on the &s;ame way in other ca&s;es. I am &s;ick, but refu&s;e medicine, or advice; I &s;hall per&s;i&s;t in the cour&s;e which ag|gravates the di&s;ea&s;e, and roots it in my con&s;tituti|on: here the di&s;ea&s;e becomes de&s;perate, and I mu&s;t die; I &s;hall ha&s;ten to the phy&s;ician and ex|hau&s;t the drugs in the apothecary's &s;hop. I have &s;tepped a&s;ide from the way; I will not yet turn back, but go on, and &s;till go on, entering one winding after another, until there be no hope of recovering the path which I had left. My hou&s;e is in flames&mdash;I will not &s;tir&mdash;the flames ri&s;e more forcibly, and &s;pread around, I am &s;till immovable. The po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;cape is at la&s;t excluded; now I will ari&s;e&mdash;I will fly&mdash;I will e&s;cape&mdash;but I cannot; the flames are on all &s;ides. I am undone; could any conduct be more infatuated? Yes, it is more infatuated to put off the thoughts of reli|gion. "How long, ye &s;imple ones, will ye love
<PB N="15" REF="13">
&s;implicity? and the &s;corners delight in their &s;corn|ing? and fools hate knowledge?"</P>
<P>You are to lay it to heart at &s;ome future period. This was the determination of Felix. It was not then convenient for him to repent, and to reform; and the convenient &s;ea&s;on never arrived. Speak of a future moment to become religious; you &s;peak again&s;t your own &s;ouls. The &s;cripture &s;ays <Q><HI>To day,</HI> if you will hear his voice; behold <HI>now</HI> is the accepted time, behold <HI>now</HI> is the day of &s;al|vation. Remember <HI>now</HI> thy Creator in the days of thy youth; &s;eek the Lord while he <HI>may be found.</HI></Q> Do you know, certainly, that you &s;hall be alive to-morrow? Has not death &s;eized many as young, as healthy, as promi&s;&s;ing as any hearing me? Has not the grave opened to receive them? Are you more &s;ecure than they were? Why boa&s;t of life? It is a vapour. If any thing be done, it mu&s;t be done now, or the opportunity of doing it may never occur. Delay not. "How long, ye &s;imple ones, will ye love &s;implicity? and the &s;corners delight in their &s;corning? and fools hate knowledge?" Let your hearts this moment ri&s;e to God; retire to your clo&s;ets, anxiou&s;ly enquiring, <Q>Lord what would&s;t thou have me to do? What &s;hall I do to be &s;aved?</Q></P>
<P>The uncertainty of life is not the only danger attending delay. In a penitent, believing, and holy conduct, is all your hope. If this be nece&s;&s;a|ry
<PB N="16" REF="14" MS="y">
to-day, it will al&s;o to-morrow, or at any fu|ture period; God will not alter his demand, but complying, will, by delay, become more difficult. There is a progre&s;s in &s;in. Habits are found to be inveterate. Can the Ethiopean change his &s;kin, or the leopard his &s;pots? Then may they do good who have been accu&s;tomed to do evil. As God will always in&s;i&s;t on repentence, faith, and new obedience in order to &s;alvation; and as the conti|nuance in an evil cour&s;e occa&s;ions a growing inca|pacity for the&s;e exerci&s;es, and even di&s;ta&s;te, no|thing can exceed the madne&s;s of venturing our eternal welfare on &s;uch a hazard. "How long, ye &s;imple ones, will ye love &s;implicity? and the &s;corners delight in their &s;cornings? and fools hate knowledge?"</P>
<P>Let not men deceive them&s;elves; God will not be mocked. If they forget him, if they di&s;obey him, he may command, <Q>Cut down the&s;e cum|berers of the ground. They &s;et at nought all my coun&s;el, they would none of my reproof. I al&s;o will laugh at their calamity, and mock when their fear cometh. Let them fall into de&s;olation, let them be con&s;umed with terrors, let their names be written in the du&s;t, and their image be de&s;pi&s;ed.</Q> Could any command my brethren, be more terrible? Yes, it would be &s;till more terrible, were the command, <Q>Let the&s;e continue on earth, let them enjoy a faithful mini&s;try, let them have line upon line, and precept upon
<PB N="17" REF="15">
precept, let them have every degree of worldly pro&s;perity, let them proceed in profaning my name, abu&s;ing my ordinances, deriding my word; let them be proof again&s;t the voice of con&s;cience, and providence, let them re&s;i&s;t my &s;pirit, and harden them&s;elves in wickedne&s;s. That at a future day, ripe for de&s;truction, they may fall, drawing down ten-fold vengeance on their devoted heads.</Q> What an intolerable &s;i|tuation! Yet, perhaps, it is not &s;ingular; tho&s;e who abu&s;e great advantages, are puni&s;hed; being left to them&s;elves, to believe a lie, and to grow wor&s;e and wor&s;e, that, in their fall, providence may warn others, and rou&s;e them to con&s;iderate and religious lives.</P>
<P>Renouncing an irreligious life, has</P>
<P N="4">IV. Immediate, and great advantages. "Turn ye at my reproof; behold, I will pour out my &s;pirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you." No doctrine more convincingly e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, both from &s;cripture and experience, than the utter inability of man to will, or to do of God's good plea&s;ure; at the &s;ame time it mu&s;t be evident that none who u&s;e their natural powers to the utmo&s;t in returning to God, have ever yet been, or, for the future, ever &s;hall be, di&s;appoint|ed. On this principle proceeds the exhortations addre&s;&s;ed in &s;cripture to tho&s;e who are wicked; and the judgments denounced when they hold
<PB N="18" REF="16">
out again&s;t the&s;e exhortations. Of all characters, Simon Majus appears to be the mo&s;t abandon|ed. Yet even he was commanded, <Q>repent, and pray God, if, perhaps, the thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee.</Q> Steps for this purpo&s;e are required of every &s;inner, which, when taken, are attended with an influence every way efficaci|ous. If at any time the heart of &s;inners relent; if now &s;ome relentne&s;s be experienced, cheri&s;h the opportunity, it is highly favourable: or &s;hould a &s;ad hardne&s;s and unrelenting di&s;po&s;ition be di&s;|criptive of your pre&s;ent &s;tate, reflect on the un|rea&s;onablene&s;s of this, of its pre&s;ent and fu|ture danger. Break off open vice, for&s;ake that company, lay a&s;ide tho&s;e books, which confirm you in infidelity; look up for mercy, per&s;i&s;t, knowing that life and death are &s;u&s;pended on the i&s;&s;ue. You are a&s;&s;ured of &s;ucce&s;s on the word of him who cannot lie. Light &s;hall break in upon your mind; you &s;hall feel new vigor; what be|fore was doubtful, &s;hall be plain. Difficulties in your way, like impa&s;&s;able mountains, &s;hall be re|moved; you &s;hall run in the ways of God's com|mandments. Men at la&s;t &s;hall undoubtedly be condemned, if de&s;titute of faith, of repentance, and of new obedience. There is as little doubt of our obtaining faith, repentance, and new obedience, if we take &s;uch &s;teps to obtain the&s;e as God re|quires us to take. "If you peri&s;h, O &s;inner, your blood &s;hall be on your own head; for you may now return to God, and he will pour out his &s;pirit upon you, and make known his words unto you."</P>

<P>OF the old Te&s;tament the Apo&s;tle here &s;peaks, for the new, when Timothy was a child, did not yet exi&s;t. That volume was in high veneration among the Jews. They in|culcated upon their children the &s;ame venera|tion. From the fir&s;t dawn of rea&s;on they made them acquainted with the &s;cripture. Had the example been univer&s;ally followed, many roots of bitterne&s;s, which &s;prang up to the ruin of the church, had long before now been extir|pated. The example is prai&s;e-worthy. Better for our children that they be ignorant of eve|ry thing be&s;ide, than ignorant of the &s;cripture. "All &s;cripture is given by in&s;piration of God."</P>
<P>Di&s;cour&s;ing from the&s;e words, the <HI>po&s;&s;ibility</HI> of &s;uch in&s;piration, the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> and the <HI>na|ture,</HI>

<P N="1">I. To illu&s;trate the <HI>po&s;&s;ibility</HI> of &s;uch in&s;pira|tion.</P>
<P>The mind is a &s;piritual &s;ub&s;tance, perfectly di&s;tinct from what is gro&s;s and material. Its capacity is great. It is a flame of fire; nothing &s;o active nor penetrating. Kindled in Heaven, it cannot be extingui&s;hed. In this con&s;i&s;ts our &s;uperiority over the bea&s;t of the field, and the fowls of Heaven; on this was impre&s;&s;ed, the image of God, in which we were originally created.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent the &s;oul is united to matter. The body was organized for its &s;ervice. This is not a &s;tate in which its native powers can be fully unfolded. Its exertions howe|ver, even now, are a&s;toni&s;hing. I confine my&s;elf to the impre&s;&s;ion which we make up|on one another. Some &s;ouls are congenial. Whenever they meet they act upon one ano|ther; they unite, and friend&s;hips, of an indi&s;|&s;olvable nature, are formed. The pure and gentle, more naturally unite with tho&s;e who are pure and gentle; the depraved and rough, with tho&s;e who are depraved and rough. How &s;ouls in&s;inuate them&s;elves into each other, and unite, is inexplicable. The fact we know, and it may be of u&s;e in the pre&s;ent di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="19" MS="y">The &s;oul is not the only &s;piritual nature in the univer&s;e. <HI>God</HI> is a &s;pirit, cele&s;tials are &s;pirits, and infernals. Are human &s;pirits alone capable of acting upon each other; or may this action and re-action be mutual to &s;pirits in general? It may certainly be mutu|al. Sugge&s;tions often ari&s;e,&mdash;we know not how. They proceed from a &s;ecret quarter. To the&s;e many a&s;cribe great part of their knowledge; by the&s;e they have been induced to undertake the mo&s;t brilliant actions. Im|pre&s;&s;ions al&s;o are often acknowledged, which forewarn men of danger, or pre&s;age happine&s;s; &s;o far our experience carries us. The Jews were of opinion that we had intimate com|munion with the world of &s;pirits, and might receive from thence either good or bad impre&s;|&s;ions. The opinion was certainly ju&s;t. This world cannot be detached. It is connected with the other. If the connection at all &s;ub&s;i&s;t, it mu&s;t with the father of our &s;pirits. This cannot rea&s;onably be denied. He who formed the mind, mu&s;t know well all its qualities, and be able to affect it in any manner and to any de|gree.</P>
<P>The po&s;&s;ibility of God's communicating the knowledge of his will to men, being allowed, it is of importance to enquire.</P>

that moment when Adam fir&s;t came into ex|i&s;tence. Suppo&s;e him placed in Eden. I &s;ee him ca&s;t his eye above, and below, on the right hand and the left; on him&s;elf and on all around. He would immediately conclude the exi&s;tence of a fir&s;t cau&s;e, infinitely wi&s;e, powerful, and good. But he would not have found out for what purpo&s;e he was made, nor what &s;ervice he mu&s;t do. He could not have known whether he could continue in exi&s;t|ence, or again fall into the &s;tate from whence he had ju&s;t awaked. He mu&s;t have lo&s;t him|&s;elf, even in the labyrinth of delights, and langui&s;hed in vain conjecture: was his hap|pine&s;s incomplete without the intercour&s;e with a fellow-creature? How much more &s;o without intercour&s;e with his maker? The book of nature, indeed, in&s;tructed him with re&s;pect to the exi&s;tence of God, and &s;ome &s;triking perfections. There it re&s;ted. He found him&s;elf a creature among myriads of creatures. His di&s;tance from God, and igno|rance of his origin, his duty, or de&s;tinati|on, mu&s;t have involved an uncertainty incon|&s;i&s;tent with happine&s;s. The Mo&s;aic account, therefore, of man's formation, is what we would have expected. The Creator revealed him&s;elf to his new made creature; introduced him to Eden; gave him it in gift; in&s;tructed him in his duty, and left his ble&s;&s;ing with him. All this is &s;o natural, and even nece&s;&s;ary,
<PB N="23" REF="21" MS="y">
that I cannot conceive how it could have been otherwi&s;e. If the knowledge of God's will was nece&s;&s;ary for men from the fir&s;t, it was more &s;o afterwards: If in the right way, he could not go on with certainty, and &s;atisfac|tion, without divine communications, much le&s;s could he have recovered it, after he had &s;tep|ped a&s;ide, degraded and fallen; the book of nature could give him no advice; not the lea&s;t hint whether he might be forgiven, or in what manner. In thunder it proclaimed the ter|rors of that power which he had provoked. It left him in awful &s;u&s;pence. In what a &s;i|tuation then, are we left, if we lay a&s;ide our bibles.</P>
<P>The po&s;&s;ibility of God's communicating his will to mankind being e&s;tabli&s;hed, and its ne|ce&s;&s;ity, we may &s;afely conclude that he has done &s;o, and in the &s;cripture, which my text &s;ays has been given by in&s;piration of God.</P>

mu&s;t be in con&s;equence of &s;omething &s;uperna|tural. Were I <HI>immediately</HI> furni&s;hed with a full acquaintance with the languages u&s;ed by the Indian tribes, &s;o as to &s;peak them fluently, this mu&s;t be by in&s;piration, although I might arrive at the &s;ame attainment in a natural way, through time and attention; or could I di&s;|cern, and circum&s;tantially relate what is doing at this moment, in France, or Britain, it mu&s;t be by in&s;piration, although without in&s;pi|ration, the per&s;on on the &s;pot may di&s;cern the&s;e things with equal clearne&s;s, and relate them as circum&s;tantially.</P>
<P>Supernatural influence may be di&s;tingui&s;hed both in <HI>kind</HI> and <HI>degree.</HI></P>
<P>Were a per&s;on di&s;cour&s;ing or writing, more &s;ecured through a &s;upernatural influence up|on his mind, from any error in what he &s;aid or wrote, than he could otherwi&s;e be; I &s;hould pronounce him in&s;pired, &s;hould there even be no marks of genius in his production; or &s;hould another, without this advantage, di&s;|cour&s;e, or write with equal preci&s;ion: or were there a book, compiled under &s;uch &s;uperna|tural influence, that what is related, and taught could not po&s;&s;ibly have any mixture of error; no doubt this is an in&s;pired book, &s;hould the writers relate many things which they &s;aw and heard, as well as what was miraculou&s;ly com|municated. Con&s;i&s;tent with this idea of in|&s;piration,
<PB N="25" REF="23" MS="y">
as a great variety of phra&s;eology, I &s;hall even allow that more elegant expre&s;&s;ions might have been u&s;ed. This is no objection. Were the &s;cripture indeed declared to be a &s;tan|dard of oratory, every defect of this kind might be urged with rea&s;on. But it is a &s;tandard of truth, if all be true. Then the phra&s;eology is not &s;o important. A &s;uperintending influence, over the minds of all the writers, &s;ecuring them ab&s;olutely from any degree of error in relating even what fell within their own knowledge, is included in that in&s;piration with which the &s;criptures were given. Had this been con&s;i|dered, it might have prevented a great torrent of abu&s;e, as if revelation had nothing to do with facts which the writer might relate, as any of us can, what we &s;ee and hear.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide, this &s;uperintending influence, which &s;ecured the writers of &s;cripture from any de|gree of error in what they wrote, a higher in|fluence was &s;ometimes enjoyed, rai&s;ing the mind to a degree of noble ardour, and &s;ublimi|ty at which it would not have arrived in a na|tural way. This appears in the &s;ong of Mo|&s;es in many p&s;alms, and in different pa&s;&s;ages in the epi&s;tles of Paul. I &s;ee no evidence, however, of its being the de&s;ign of Providence to mark out tho&s;e who &s;peak in God's name, by &s;uch elevation of &s;entiment and &s;tile &s;ince &s;uch frequently deliver their me&s;&s;age in the plaine&s;t and &s;imple&s;t manner.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="24" MS="y">The mo&s;t extraordinary degree of in&s;pirati|on, is where the natural faculties of the pro|phet were &s;u&s;pended, and he became merely an organ, through whom God communicated his will to men, dictating both the matter and the language by immediate &s;ugge&s;tion. This happened in foretelling future events, of which they otherwi&s;e could have no idea; but even here, a &s;uperintending influence was nece&s;&s;ary, that the prophecy might be delivered to others exactly as it was received from God.</P>
<P>What therefore is a&s;&s;erted in my text, and what I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t upon, is this, that all the writers of &s;cripture, uniformly in the&s;e wri|tings, were under &s;uch a &s;upernatural influence, that they delivered the whole truth of God, without any degree of mixture or error.</P>
<P>It appears, evidently, that Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles believed the Old Te&s;tament to have been written in this manner.</P>
<P>It is mentioned as a high honour conferred upon the Jews that, "unto them were com|mitted the <HI>oracles</HI> of God." God had dictat|ed and given authenticity to the&s;e &s;criptures of which the Jews were the guardians. <HI>We have</HI> (&s;ays Peter, &s;peaking of the &s;crip|tures) <HI>a more &s;ure word of prophecy: whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that
<PB N="27" REF="25" MS="y">
&s;hineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day &s;tar ari&s;e in your hearts. Knowing this fir&s;t, that no prophecy of the &s;cripture is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God &s;pake as they were moved by the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e words intimate that the prophets did not work them&s;elves up into &s;uch agitations as led them to utter the predictions and ora|cles which are recorded, but were borne on by the Holy Gho&s;t declaring, as his organ, what he di&s;po&s;ed them to declare, or what he &s;ug|ge&s;ted for the benefit of mankind. In a con|ver&s;ation with the Jews, our Saviour in&s;i&s;ted, <HI>Is it not written in your law, I &s;aid, Ye are Gods? If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came: and the &s;cripture cannot be broken: &s;ay ye of him, whom the father hath &s;anctioned, and &s;ent into the world, Thou bla&s;pheme&s;t; be|cau&s;e I &s;aid, I am the Son of God?</HI></P>
<P>Here, not the truth only of the Old Te&s;tament is a&s;&s;erted; but what is more, it is a&s;&s;erted that the&s;e writings cannot be charged with any im|propriety of expre&s;&s;ion. Their direction in every in&s;tance is &s;afe, and their deci&s;ion infallible. The declaration of my text is po&s;itive and uni|ver&s;al. All &s;cripture is given by in&s;piration of God.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="26" MS="y">The writers of the New Te&s;tament believed them&s;elves under a divine influence, and deli|vered their me&s;&s;age as the amba&s;&s;adors of God. Writing to the The&s;&s;alonians, the apo&s;|tle is expre&s;s, <Q>He that de&s;pi&s;eth, de&s;pi&s;eth not man, but God, who hath al&s;o given unto us his holy &s;pirit.</Q> Speaking of the ordi|nance of the &s;upper, he &s;ays, <Q>I received of the Lord that which al&s;o I delivered unto you:</Q>&mdash;His a&s;&s;ertions to the Ephe&s;ians in|clude his fellow apo&s;tles, and brethren, as well as him&s;elf. <HI>Ye have heard of the di&s;pen&s;ation of the grace of God, which is given me to you-ward; How that by revelation he made known unto me the mi&s;tery; as I wrote afore in few words. Where|by, when ye read, ye may under&s;tand my knowledge in the my&s;tery of Chri&s;t. Which in other ages was not made known unto the &s;ons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apo&s;tles and prophets.</HI></P>
<P>Peter allows the commandment of the apo&s;|tles equal weight with the words &s;poken be|fore by the holy prophets, and particularly gives the epi&s;tles of Paul the &s;ame authen|ticity with other &s;criptures. This was per|fectly agreeable to their Saviour's a&s;&s;urance, that the &s;pirit &s;hould abide with them to guide them into all truth and to bring his in&s;tructions to their remembrance.</P>
<P>To this doctrine, which I have been in&s;i&s;ting
<PB N="29" REF="27" MS="y">
upon, &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages have heen objected, par|ticularly when the apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>Unto the mar|ried I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her hu&s;band. But to the re&s;t &s;peak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and &s;he be plea&s;ed to dwell with him, let him not put her away. Now, concerning virgins, I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgement, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful. I &s;uppo&s;e, there|fore, that this is good for the pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s: I &s;ay, that it is good for a man &s;o to be. The wife is bound by the law as long as her hu&s;band liveth: but if her hu&s;band be dead, &s;he is at liberty to be married to whom &s;he will; only in the Lord. But &s;he is happier if &s;he &s;o abide, after my judg|ment: and I think al&s;o that I have the Spirit of God.</HI></P>
<P>In&s;pired writers, &s;ay objectors, would not have &s;poken thus. The objection here as ge|nerally ari&s;eth from inattention to the pa&s;&s;age. The laws of chri&s;tianity, with re&s;pect to per&s;ons in a &s;ingle or married life, are here &s;tated. Some ca&s;es had been taken notice of by our Savi|our, during his per&s;onal mini&s;try, and decided upon: he had &s;aid nothing of other ca&s;es. The&s;e were re&s;erved for his &s;ervant &s;peaking in his name. The apo&s;tle points out the ca&s;es which had been decided upon by our Saviour in per&s;on; and the ca&s;es al&s;o which not yet decided upon, received now the deci&s;ion of the
<PB N="30" REF="28" MS="y">
apo&s;tle. The apo&s;tle was writing to tho&s;e who que&s;tioned his apo&s;tle&s;hip. His expre&s;&s;ions, in this view, appear very &s;uitable: <HI>I think, I have the &s;pirit of God&mdash;I give my judgment as one who hath obtained mercy.</HI> Which expre&s;&s;ions, in this connection, a&s;&s;ert in very intelligible and proper language, his being, in the&s;e d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ci&s;ions, divinely in&s;pired. Other objections of a &s;imilar kind appear, on examination, to be equally futile.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t extraordinary objection again&s;t revelation, which I recollect to have &s;een urg|ed, is; admit that a thing is revealed to me, the moment I communicate it to others, it cannot with them have the weight of revelati|on, but becomes hear-&s;ay, which they may treat as they plea&s;e. This &s;trikes at the root of all human te&s;timony, nay, it declares it im|po&s;&s;ible for God to make known his will thro' any medium&mdash;it mu&s;t be immediately or not at all. The objection goes farther than tho&s;e by whom it is made, intend; it &s;trikes at eve|ry medium of communication, even the hea|vens and the earth as in&s;tructors, the&s;e are opaque bodies, introduced between, the crea|ture and the Creator, and mu&s;t not be admitted.</P>
<P>It is ab&s;urd to &s;ay that God may commu|nicate the knowledge of him&s;elf to mankind through the imperfect medium of the inani|mate creation, and yet the more perfect me|dium of the rational creation be rejected. I
<PB N="31" REF="29" MS="y">
know not that I ever met a weaker, or more irrational a&s;&s;ertion. Indeed I would not take it merely on the word of any man that God had &s;poken to him, I mu&s;t have &s;ome evi|dence thereof; this I would require in any te&s;ti|mony in which I am nearly concerned, but &s;atisfied of this evidence, I could no more di&s;|believe the te&s;timony in the one ca&s;e than in the other.</P>
<P>In the darkne&s;s with which we are inve&s;ted in this world, is it not de&s;irable to have a light for our direction, on which we can de|pend? Is it not rea&s;onable to follow that light even when it lays open a view which, in ma|ny re&s;pects, a&s;toni&s;hes our finite capacities? Becau&s;e &s;omethings are more difficult, &s;hall I refu&s;e to avail my&s;elf of what is u&s;eful and ea&s;y? No rea&s;on can ju&s;tify &s;uch conduct. The &s;cripture is our only guide. Improve it as &s;uch. Let it be the light to your feet, and the lamp to your way. Meditate on it day and night; let it dwell in you; let it be your delight, and your coun&s;ellor; you &s;hall find it perfect, converting the &s;oul; &s;ure, making wi&s;e the &s;imple; right, rejoicing the heart; pure, enlightening the eyes. It will warn you again&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; it will reward your obedience.</P>
<P>Having God's commandments in your heart you will, no doubt, find it your duty, and you
<PB N="32" REF="30">
will think it your plea&s;ure to <HI>teach them dili|gently unto thy children, and &s;halt talk of them when thou &s;itte&s;t in thine hou&s;e, and when thou walke&s;t by the way, and when thou lie&s;t down, and when thou ri&s;e&s;t up.</HI></P>
<P>When men neither read their bibles, nor follow their direction; when children are brought up like heathens, having no know|ledge of the &s;criptures, nor reverence for them, it is no wonder if the&s;e be de&s;pi&s;ed and every trifler, however ignorant of the &s;cripture, and palpably wrong in the mo&s;t known facts, who choo&s;es, notwith&s;tanding, to laugh at them, be li&s;tened to as an oracle, and be circulated through many nations, I &s;ee nothing rea&s;onable in this. If we be in an error, make it appear. Sub&s;tantiate a&s;&s;ertions with proper evidence. But &s;corn is no argument. It may amu&s;e the incon&s;iderate. It can never have any weight with tho&s;e who think for them&s;elves. Such attempts again&s;t chri&s;tianity are to me an evi|dence of its truth. Men never u&s;e &s;uch wea|pons when better ones are in their power.</P>
<P>Thus circum&s;tanced, it is for the credit, as well as the comfort of chri&s;tians, not only to be|lieve, but al&s;o to be able to give a rea&s;on for their faith; to know that they do not follow a cunningly divi&s;ed fable, and al&s;o to convince others of this.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="31">For this purpo&s;e I have entered on the pre|&s;ent &s;eries of di&s;cour&s;es. The times appeared to demand it. Your comfort demands it, and your e&s;tabli&s;hment. It has been demanded by duty. In &s;ea&s;on we are to preach: to make full proof of the mini&s;try: to be zealous for the truth: particularly &s;ince tho&s;e perilous times have commenced, when men will not endure &s;ound doctrine, but, renouncing the truth, are turned unto fables.</P>
<P>Having at pre&s;ent &s;tated the po&s;&s;ibility, the nece&s;&s;ity and nature of in&s;piration, I &s;hall, God willing, look into the &s;criptures them|&s;elves, and &s;ee what evidence they give of be|ing in&s;pired writings.

<P>THIS p&s;alm was written by David. It has &s;omething curious in the texture. It contains as many parts as there are letters in the Hebrew alphabet. Each part con&s;i&s;ts of eight ver&s;es, and begins with the latter, where|with it is particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed. The de&s;ign of the whole, is to di&s;cover the great advantages which may be derived from &s;tudy|ing the &s;criptures, e&s;pecially when divine illu|mination attends that &s;tudy.</P>
<P>I have already illu&s;trated the apo&s;tle's a&s;&s;er|tion that "all &s;cripture is given by in&s;piration of God;" in&s;i&s;ting upon the <HI>po&s;&s;ibility,</HI> the <HI>nece&s;|&s;ity</HI> and <HI>nature</HI> of &s;uch in&s;piration. The &s;ame influence under which the &s;cripture was writ|ten,
<PB N="35" REF="33" MS="y">
is in its mea&s;ure, nece&s;&s;ary that we may read with judgment and advantage. Under this influence wondrous di&s;coveries may be expected from God's law. Let us, depend|ing thereon, attend to the&s;e di&s;coveries.</P>
<P>What is it a rea&s;onable per&s;on would expect from revelation? No doubt &s;ome account of the world and of that power by which it has been produced; the origin of mankind, their character, their duties, their pro&s;pects, all this is found in the &s;cripture. I &s;hall enquire fir&s;t what the old te&s;tament &s;ays of the&s;e things, and then, what the new.</P>
<P>The Old Te&s;tament opens with an account of creation. Nothing can be conceived more a&s;toni&s;hing. A pompous de&s;cription is, no doubt expected, which unfolds the powers of nature, and leaves nothing doubtful in the &s;y&s;tem of a&s;tronomy. Such the compo&s;ition, had it been human; but its ca&s;e and &s;implici|ty argues it divine. Room is left for philo&s;o|phic re&s;earches. The laws of nature, which common minds cannot penetrate, may be &s;ought after: with &s;uch re&s;earches religion has no immediate concern. It is accommodated to all. The in&s;truction is not above the dull|e&s;t capacity, nor unworthy of the mo&s;t brilli|ant. Things are &s;poken of as they appear to every one; nor is any thing &s;aid contradictory
<PB N="36" REF="34" MS="y">
to the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing di&s;coveries. The &s;im|ple truth intelligible to all, and of chief im|portance, is clearly &s;tated at the very opening of &s;cripture. <Q>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth;</Q> and afterwards, "God created man in his own image." This is the foundation of all religion. The &s;ubject unfolds as our acquaintance with the &s;cripture increa&s;es, leaving the mind impre&s;&s;ed with the nece&s;&s;ity of loving the Lord our God with all our heart, and all our &s;oul, and all our minds, as a fir&s;t and indi&s;pen&s;able duty. The foundation al&s;o for the other branch of duties, is thus early laid, when we &s;ee all nations &s;pringing from the &s;ame root, and from this circum&s;tance having rea&s;on to love their neigh|bours as they love them&s;elves. The fir&s;t chapter of Gene&s;is therefore, not only di&s;covers the origin of this world, but al&s;o lays the foun|dation for all the duties of a religious or moral kind, which we owe either to God or to each other. Here we have the ground work of the whole &s;cripture. A light breaks upon us which becomes more evident, obligations are felt which every page enforces. The lan|guage is as admirable as the &s;ubject. To this the be&s;t and mo&s;t unexceptionable judges bear witne&s;s. Longinus, who&s;e good ta&s;te has been the admiration of ages, who al&s;o was a Hea|then, from mere conviction gives the highe&s;t character of the writings of Mo&s;es. <Q>The
<PB N="37" REF="35" MS="y">
Jewi&s;h legi&s;lator,</Q> &s;ays he, in his treati&s;e on the &s;ublime, <Q>no ordinary per&s;on, having conceived a ju&s;t idea of the power of God, has nobly expre&s;&s;ed it in the beginning of his law.</Q> "and God &s;aid,"&mdash;what?&mdash;<Q>Let there be light, and there was light, let the earth be, and the earth was.</Q></P>
<P>I have been the more particular in this &s;tatement, to &s;hew the propriety of revelation's opening as it does. That Mo&s;es did write this account, and it was communicated to him, will be examined afterwards; in the mean time it mu&s;t &s;trike every one, that a better in|troduction to the knowledge of God, and of our duty cannot be conceived. It has been urged that the Mo&s;aic account of the creation contradicts the truth, and di&s;courages all phi|lo&s;ophical inve&s;tigations; I mu&s;t contend that no &s;uch contradiction is found therein, and that it di&s;courages no &s;uch inve&s;tigations. Per&s;ons indeed of influence in the church may have taken unwarrantable &s;teps, which have had &s;uch a tendency, carefully di&s;tingui&s;h the actions of men from the principles which ought to regulate the&s;e actions. Revert to the &s;crip|tures them&s;elves. They contain no &s;uch contradictions; they bring forth none of the di&s;couragements mentioned. An objection of this kind, from the man too who has made it his bu&s;ine&s;s to fix our attention to principles, is the more invidious; it &s;hews &s;omething wor&s;e
<PB N="38" REF="36">
than ignorance. He takes things for granted which cannot be proved; and then builds an airy fabrick, &s;pacious indeed, but un&s;ub&s;tanti|al. Is &s;uch an inve&s;tigation worthy of no|tice? Is it rational? or even ju&s;t? Nothing can be more unfair, nor contradictory to his own principles in other in&s;tances.</P>
<P>As the &s;cripture gives us an account of the origin of the world, it al&s;o expo&s;es the cha|racter of mankind; which is not <HI>now</HI> what it was <HI>once.</HI> Man was made innocent; but fell from his innocency. The Mo&s;aic account of this has employed the wit of dei&s;tical writers time immemorial, upon this they have ex|hau&s;ted their obliquy; irony fla&s;hes from every page of their writings. The be&s;t way of dealing with &s;uch oppo&s;ers, is &s;imply to &s;tate the truth. Let light enter, darkne&s;s of it&s;elf will go away.</P>
<P>If Adam was indebted to God for exi&s;tence, for Paradi&s;e, for enjoyments of an intellectual, as well as animal nature, had not &s;uch a bene|factor every right to command, and di&s;po&s;e of him? If his authority was ab&s;olute, could not his wi&s;dom decide on that command which was the proper te&s;t of obedience? An indif|ferent action is fixed upon; this tree I retain, the re&s;t are yours; neither look upon what I withhold, nor touch it, nor eat of its fruit:&mdash;
<PB N="39" REF="37" MS="y">
Was not this a rea&s;onable command? If all belonged to God, might he not give any part, or retain any part? And if he was plea&s;ed to in|terpo&s;e his command, &s;hall a di&s;puting thought ari&s;e? A murmuring word be heard? Obedi|ence was acknowledging God's right in all, and honouring his authority. Di&s;obedience was to di&s;pute his right, to throw off his au|thority: It included every crime, highly ag|gravated, Adam therefore was guarded again&s;t it, by &s;evere penalties. Creatures, even the highe&s;t and mo&s;t pure have been made change|able. It was in their power to &s;tand or to fall. Some &s;tood, &s;ome fell; Adam was put on an equal footing with others. There was no nece&s;&s;ity upon him to be di&s;obedient; nay, every thing encouraged his obedience. Still his will was free.</P>
<P>Think for a moment of his temptations. Eve was fir&s;t deceived; but how? In inno|cency. Angels were, probably, very familiar with our fir&s;t parents. Their conver&s;ation was welcome; as it was in&s;tructive. They became vi&s;ible in different &s;hapes. The hu|man, no doubt, was the mo&s;t common; but not exclu&s;ive of others. Sometimes it was a cherub, or beautiful flying ox; at other times a &s;eraph, or winged &s;hining &s;erpent. In this la&s;t &s;hape the fallen &s;pirit might have intro|duced him&s;elf to Eve, referring, probably, to
<PB N="40" REF="38" MS="y">
which, the apo&s;tles &s;ays, <Q>Satan him&s;elf is transformed into an angel of light.</Q> Eve, believing her&s;elf talking with an angel, might ea&s;ily be per&s;uaded that &s;he had mi&s;under&s;tood the divine command, or that it had been al|tered, under &s;uch deceit &s;he eat, and had influ|ence enough with her hu&s;band to involve him in the &s;ame tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. I need not expati|ate on the attrocity of the crime. This mu&s;t &s;trike every rea&s;onable per&s;on. It incurred &s;e|vere puni&s;hment. All this appears natural. It might have been expected that God would exact of men, &s;ome te&s;t of obedience. A po&s;|&s;ibility of their falling was in&s;eparable from the condition of creatures. The whole tran&s;acti|on is &s;olemn and &s;uitable. If obedience would have tran&s;mitted benefits of the mo&s;t impor|tant nature to di&s;tant ages, why &s;hould not di&s;obedience extend the calamity as far as obe|dience would the benefit. That &s;uch cala|mity is endured, is matter of fact, felt by men in all ages, and the account of it herein given, is as &s;atisfactory as any which has ever been given. It is ea&s;y to <HI>laugh,</HI> and by blending truth and fable in one &s;tory, as a late writer has done, to produce a ridiculous &s;cene. Such attempts in a matter of &s;o much moment is highly cen&s;urable. Let &s;uch writers, reject|ing the Mo&s;aic account, give us a better one, which none of them pretend to do, whereby they may re&s;olve our enquiries with re&s;pect to
<PB N="41" REF="39" MS="y">
the general depravity of mankind, and the ills which every where prevail; or keeping exactly to the Mo&s;aic account without any foreign mixture. Let them &s;hew its ab&s;urdity: nei|ther have they done this. I mu&s;t then in&s;i&s;t, that &s;uch per&s;ons trifle with mankind, and de|&s;erve rather their pity as madmen, than their ear as prudent coun&s;ellors.</P>
<P>After man's defection from his duty is un|folded, the Old Te&s;tament proceeds to di&s;co|ver the con&s;equence. It drew depravity and ruin, not on Adam and Eve only, but on all their de&s;cendants. But how can this be prov|ed? By the mo&s;t unan&s;werable of all argu|ments, plain, univer&s;al, and well-authenticated facts. Individuals, families, and nations are brought in view. Cain grew a mon&s;ter for his impiety, and murderous de&s;igns. His de|&s;cendants trod too exactly in his foot&s;teps; Lamach was particularly notorious; nay, im|piety, cruelty, and blood&s;hed became &s;o com|mon, that it was nece&s;&s;ary that the divine di&s;|plea&s;ure be di&s;covered bringing upon &s;uch a race, a general deluge. It is not probable that wickedne&s;s &s;ince the flood, has ever ri&s;en &s;o univer&s;ally to &s;uch an height, yet the general tendency to wickedne&s;s is too evident. Noah, although eminent for his piety was overtaken with intoxication. Ham, one of his children, di&s;covered, by di&s;graceful conduct, the utter depravity of his di&s;po&s;ition. The building of
<PB N="42" REF="40" MS="y">
Babel proceeded from an ill view. It &s;eems to have been Noah's de&s;ign to divide the earth among his &s;ons, and to di&s;mi&s;s each to his re&s;|pective allotment. They were not compliant. Babel probably was built to enable them, effec|tually to thwart Noah's de&s;ign. It however only ha&s;tened the di&s;per&s;ion. Removed from the eye of Noah, they paid little attention to religion, which &s;oon lo&s;t its original &s;implicity. Abraham and his family are brought in view, that God in his dealings with them might awaken men to a &s;en&s;e of their duty. Although per&s;ons of di&s;tingui&s;hed piety aro&s;e from this family, in all we ob&s;erve great blemi&s;hes. Ja|cob by no means acted the fair part with E&s;au, Simeon and Levi were guilty of wanton cru|elty; ever under oppre&s;&s;ion in Egypt, the treat|ment of the I&s;raelites to each other cannot be ju&s;tified; a &s;tronger picture of an irreligious, incon&s;iderate, &s;tuff-necked di&s;po&s;ion cannot be drawn than what we have of the wanderers in the wilderne&s;s. Samp&s;on, who&s;e &s;trength of body could repre&s;s the force of armies, fell a victim to his own pa&s;&s;ions. David's mind, tender under affliction, enfeebled through re|po&s;e, was hardened to commit a complicated and attrocious crime. Solomon's wi&s;dom to|wards the conclu&s;ion of his reign was di&s;graced with an egregious act of folly. Abra|ham's faith; by unbelief. The &s;cripture re|lates fathfully the&s;e facts. The inference is
<PB N="43" REF="41" MS="y">
left for the reader. Human nature has been the &s;ame from the beginning that it is now. It is de&s;perately wicked. No &s;pecies of folly, of debauchery, of crimes of which it is not ca|pable. The &s;cripture here is a faithful witne&s;s. If a different account been given; it had been fal&s;e. This circum&s;tance, which &s;peaks mo&s;t di&s;tinctly, the authenticity of &s;cripture, has been u&s;ed as a weapon for its overthrow. No perver&s;ion is &s;o in&s;ufferable. What can a late writer mean by &s;aying, <Q>When we read the ob&s;cene &s;tories, the voluptuous debaucheris, the cruel and torturous executions, the unre|lenting vindictivene&s;s; with which more than half the bible is filled, it would be more con&s;i&s;tent that we called it the word of a De|mon, than the word of God.</Q> This is a &s;trange pa&s;&s;age. Were I to relate the death of the king of France, and in&s;i&s;t on &s;ome preceeding &s;everities, am I, becau&s;e I relate the&s;e things, any ways accountable for that death or the&s;e &s;everities? If I paint any crime in its native deformity, in order to deter all from the com|mi&s;&s;ion thereof. Is this the work of a Dea|mon? Does it not rather de&s;erve prai&s;e than blame? The &s;cripture draws a di&s;torted cha|racter. The character indeed de&s;erves the highe&s;t dete&s;tation. It transforms men into brutes, or devils&mdash;but the &s;cripture has no blame. It acts the office of a friend. It would convince men of their wickedne&s;s, that
<PB N="44" REF="42" MS="y">
it might turn them from it, and lead them in the right way. Were this con&s;idered, unbe|lievers would not allow them&s;elves to &s;narle and carp as they do, at the &s;cripture repre&s;en|tations. When the&s;e di&s;covered the folly, in|con&s;i&s;tency, and wickedne&s;s of human nature, every thought would be ab&s;orbed in this one. <Q>Ah, that is my picture, were it not for re|&s;training grace;&mdash;&s;hall I dete&s;t the book that perpetuates this picture and places it before me? Rather let me dete&s;t the heart capable of &s;uch depravity; I mu&s;t, as a &s;inner, be as odious to God as I am hateful to my&s;elf. O wretched man that I am, who &s;hall deli|ver me from this body of death!</Q></P>
<P>But does the Old Te&s;tament pre&s;ent us with the gloomy view only? No. It al&s;o introduces light. Pro&s;pects open to awaken to comfort, and direct the &s;ons of men.</P>
<P>The exclu&s;ion after the fall from the tree of life, whatever deri&s;ion this circum&s;tance has occa&s;ioned, was in pity to mankind. The fruit of that tree contained a juice which tend|ed to immortalize the body. A life of mi&s;ery, and change protracted during endle&s;s ages had been a dreadful cur&s;e. Although death be a &s;tate of degradation and puni&s;hment, &s;till it is de&s;irable in our pre&s;ent circum&s;tances. Adam &s;oon found that all was not lo&s;t. A victory is promi&s;ed over the &s;erpent. The mi&s;chief
<PB N="45" REF="43" MS="y">
which his wiles had occa&s;ioned to mankind, &s;hould be removed. Man might yet be hap|py: the honour of the divine law &s;ecured, and his nature renovated. It &s;hould &s;till be po&s;&s;ible for him to walk with God on earth, and dwell with him in heaven. He mu&s;t be indebted to ano|ther. Sacrifics in u&s;e from the fir&s;t, and the Jew|i&s;h ritual e&s;tabli&s;hed afterwards at Sinai were appointed of God to impre&s;s this upon the mind. Rea&s;on could not have dictated &s;uch a prac|tice. Its origin and univer&s;al adoption mu&s;t have proceeded from revelation only.</P>
<P>Ob&s;tacles in the way of man's acceptance with God, being removed, the renovation of his nature was al&s;o provided for. The agent here is the Holy Spirit. Often is he mentioned in the Old Te&s;tament. The &s;aints a&s;cribe their holine&s;s to his influence. Taking from &s;inners the &s;tony heart, he cau&s;es them to walk in God's &s;tatutes, to keep his judgments, and to do them. Be&s;ides this influence, pro|per motives are placed before them, in the judgements which fall on the wicked, and the mercies with which the righteous were vi&s;ited. The book of Eccle&s;ia&s;tes di&s;&s;uades men from earthly and &s;en&s;ual conduct; the book of P&s;alms encourages a devout and heavenly &s;pirit. The Proverbs afford a variety of maxims of a mo|ral and religious kind for our conduct in life; and all the prophets in their in&s;truction ad|dre&s;s
<PB N="46" REF="44" MS="y">
equally the hopes and fears of man|kind.</P>
<P>There is no doubt but the belief of a future &s;tate was cheri&s;hed by the Old Te&s;tament. This doctrine was known to Adam. He of|ten conver&s;ed with the inhabitants of the &s;pi|ritual world; and was certain that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an immortal principle. Enoch was removed before the flood from earth to heaven, in a vi|&s;ible manner; Elijah after the flood. Abraham had his eye fixed upon a heavenly country. The martyrs in the days of Maccabeus, be|lieved in a better re&s;urrection. All the &s;aints po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed this faith, and received therefrom great encouragement</P>
<P>The Old Te&s;tament was written at differ|ent times, by per&s;ons of various capacities, and in places exceedingly remote, yet they harmonize in a wonderful degree. Every where we find the &s;ame doctrines, and pre|cepts. All is uni&s;on.</P>
<P>Their credibility is further e&s;tabli&s;hed, when &s;acred, is viewed in connection with profane hi&s;tory. The tradition of the golden age, is derived from the &s;tate of innocency. The nectar and ambro&s;ia, which the heathens &s;up|po&s;ed pre&s;erved their Gods in immortality, from the tree of life: hence al&s;o the idea of the great Panacea, or univer&s;al medicine &s;o much
<PB N="47" REF="45">
celebrated by the poets. What the poets &s;ay of the giants, evidently alludes to the &s;tate of things before the de&s;truction of the old world. Deucalions's &s;tory, as related by Ovid, is the tradition concerning the flood. I only menti|on the&s;e things now, they will again occur and be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in their proper place.</P>
<P>If we really wi&s;h to be &s;atisfied whether the &s;criptures be indeed the word of God, in peru&s;ing them, be &s;erious and unbia&s;&s;ed; de|pend al&s;o in doing &s;o, on that &s;pirit by which they have been dictated, to give us a con&s;iderate di&s;cerning mind. It &s;hall not be in vain. Multitudes have found this volume an ine&s;ti|mable trea&s;ure. It has made them acquainted with God, and with them&s;elves; with their duty of a moral, and religious kind; with their bu&s;ine&s;s on earth; and their way to heaven. The direction which this book has given; the comfort which it has in&s;pired, the re|&s;traints which it has laid, and the encourage|ments which it has afforded, have obliged men to confe&s;s that it is more to be de&s;ired than gold, yea than much fine gold; &s;weeter al&s;o than honey, and the honey comb.</P>
<P>My ob&s;ervations on the New Te&s;tament, &s;hall be very &s;hort. If even in the Old Te&s;ta|ment, we have &s;uch traces of a divine revelation, they are more evident in the <HI>new.</HI> In both we &s;ee the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem. The fir&s;t elements
<PB N="48" REF="46" MS="y">
of religion are given us in the one; in the other religion is brought to perfection.</P>
<P>The four Evangili&s;ts and the Acts of the Apo&s;tles give us the hi&s;tory of our Saviour, and of his apo&s;tles. What, in our Saviour's birth was &s;upernatural, might have been expected. "A <HI>virgin,</HI>" &s;ays the prophet, <Q>&s;hall bring forth a &s;on.</Q> Was there in this any thing above creative power, or was that power ever exerted on a more noble occa&s;ion, than in pro|ducing the holy thing denominated the Son of God? In the ordinary cour&s;e of things, hu|man nature would have had an original taint. It, in this in&s;tance, mu&s;t be perfectly pure: To effect which, God &s;teps out of his ordina|ry way. And &s;hall we object? If his way be in the &s;ea, and his path in the deep waters. If his coun&s;els be un&s;earchable. This might have been expected. With the &s;implicity of children, with the tractability of &s;cholars, let us li&s;ten, let us believe. The matter of fact indeed fell under the cognizance of few wit|ne&s;&s;es; but the&s;e were very credible. The cha|racter both of Mary and Jo&s;eph, was reputable. Their &s;tory was thoroughly weighed by Zacha|rias and Elizabeth. It was credible from for|mer prophecy. The future events in the life of Je&s;us added to its credibility. The man &s;o rea|dy to &s;ay with Thomas, unle&s;s I &s;ee, I will not believe, ought with equal readine&s;s, to yield to tho&s;e convictions which overcame, in
<PB N="49" REF="47" MS="y">
Jo&s;eph, the &s;tronge&s;t &s;u&s;picions, of which the human mind is capable.</P>
<P>The di&s;ciples, who were Jews in ordinary life, without the advantages of learning, and of general conver&s;e with the world, were not attached to the &s;y&s;tems of other nations; nay, were probably unacquainted with them, and &s;o far as the&s;e were known, had in&s;uperable ob|jections again&s;t them; be&s;ides, they neither po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed inclination, nor capacity to form any &s;y&s;tem which could command general attenti|on. They were merely agents. Je&s;us in|&s;tructed them and &s;ent them forth in his name; of their divine commi&s;&s;ion, they produced full evidence. It was not material whether our Saviour was plea&s;ed him&s;elf to write what was for the in&s;truction of the church in future ages, or furni&s;hed his di&s;ciples to do &s;o, and placed them under &s;uch a &s;uperintending in|fluence, that they could commit no mi&s;take. It is far from being true, that employing the&s;e as agents, was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. Our Sa|viour might him&s;elf have written the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem, and left it as his la&s;t legacy to the church. We find him writing on a memorable occa&s;ion. It is not for us to dictate. Infiinte wi&s;dom has regulated this matter &s;o as is mo&s;t conducive to promote the de&s;igns of the go&s;pel. Meek and humble minds have perfect &s;atisfac|tion. It was, perhaps, fit that infidels have
<PB N="50" REF="48" MS="y">
&s;omething on which to vent the rancor of their perverted be&s;otted minds.</P>
<P>The doctrines of the New Te&s;tament are &s;piritual and &s;ublime. Their lu&s;tre blends the prejudiced, who, not perceiving their nature, &s;peak of them with contempt. The incarna|tion and death of the Son of God, as an atonement for mankind, give particular of|fence. It is ob&s;ervable that this has been the uniform doctrine of &s;cripture, It was taught our fir&s;t parents in Eden. It was believed by Abel. It was illu&s;trated by all the in&s;titutions of the Jewi&s;h church. It produced in the pa|triarches and prophets, confidence and joy. It breeds admiration in Angels. The redeemed above cea&s;e not to celebrate his prai&s;e, who loved them and wa&s;hed them from their &s;ins in his blood. The&s;e con&s;iderations may well, outweigh the in&s;ulting &s;urmi&s;es of a pre&s;ump|tuous man. The di&s;pen&s;ation it&s;elf is a&s;to|ni&s;hing. We &s;ee the plan only in an imper|fect &s;tate. It may be founded in rea&s;ons which we cannot now penetrate. We may di&s;pute to our ruin; but it is mo&s;t prudent as well as &s;afe to believe.</P>
<P>The Deity is repre&s;ented in the mo&s;t amia|ble and worthy light. He is propo&s;ed as our pattern. The precepts deduced from the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem, are &s;o &s;uitable, that practi&s;ed, they would change this wilderne&s;s into paradi&s;e,
<PB N="51" REF="49" MS="y">
earth into heaven, the tumult of war and con|tention into a de&s;irable and la&s;ting calm. What&s;oever things are true, what&s;oever things are hone&s;t, what&s;oever things are ju&s;t, what&s;o|ever things are pure, what&s;oever things are lovely, what&s;oever things are of good report: If there be any virtue, if their be any prai&s;e, they are propo&s;ed to our attentive con&s;iderati|on, and enforced by &s;triking examples.</P>
<P>If you read the word prejudiced again&s;t it, and determined to turn it into ridicule, you cannot expect that God will open your eyes and di&s;cover to you the wondrous things found in his law, he will rather leave you to believe a lie, and allow your hearts to be hardened by that fire which &s;oftens others, to your utter ruin.</P>
<P>You will ea&s;ily perceive, and I hope you will keep in mind, the method which I have propo&s;ed to my&s;elf, in the defence, which, de|pending on divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I have under|taken, of our holy religion, again&s;t the levels of infidels and the &s;neer of fools.</P>
<P>I have &s;tated the po&s;&s;ibility, the nece&s;&s;ity, and nature of in&s;piration, and have &s;hewn that the writers of &s;cripture, claim our attention as writing under &s;uch in&s;piration. I have now adduced my fir&s;t proof. Looking into the &s;criptures, we find every thing there we would expect from a revelation. It was nece&s;&s;ary to
<PB N="52" REF="50" MS="y">
begin with this, for if, as the enemies of revelati|on &s;ay, &s;cripture contains any thing unworthy of God, or ruinous to man, no further proof is nece&s;&s;ary. The bible ought to be rejected as a &s;purious production. Nothing, however, of this kind, has appeared, but the very re|ver&s;e, every thing is worthy of God, and bene|ficial to men.</P>
<P>After &s;peaking of the Old and the New Te&s;taments, I &s;hall next &s;hew the confirmati|on which revelation receives from prophecy and miracle, &s;hall &s;peak of the u&s;e of rea&s;on in religion, and then prove the antiquity of &s;crip|ture, taking notice of its writers, of its publica|tion, and the credibility which it receives from the te&s;timony of other hi&s;tory. The plan is exten&s;ive. I &s;hall endeavour to keep every di&s;cu&s;&s;ion di&s;tinct, and to be as full and &s;atis|factory in each di&s;cu&s;&s;ion as my abilities, and opportunities admit.</P>

<HEAD>DISCOURSE IV. INSPIRATION ARGUED FROM PROPHECY.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>PSALMS, c,xlvii. 5.</HI></BIBL>
<P>His under&s;tanding is infinite.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is a general opinion that this p&s;alm in which the devout Jews celebrated the per|fections of God, manife&s;ted in a great delive|rance, was written after the captivity. Hav|ing &s;poken of God's goodne&s;s and power The p&s;alme&s;t adds, <Q>His under&s;tanding is infinite.</Q> To this attribute I am now, through divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to call your attenti|on. Infinite under&s;tanding is di&s;covered in the exact knowledge which God has of all his works. He &s;ees what is pa&s;t, or what is to come with equal preci&s;ion as what is pre&s;ent, of nothing can he be ignorant, whether the actions of angels or of men: things done in the vi&s;ible or invi&s;ible world, what takes place in time or in eternity. A knowledge &s;o ex|ten&s;ive, &s;o minute, exceeds our comprehen&s;i|on.
<PB N="54" REF="52" MS="y">
It can belong to God only. If writings can be found which contain &s;uch knowledge, to &s;uch writings is affixed the &s;eal of heaven. I am now to contend that this &s;acred volume, whence originates all our hopes, is thus de|clared to be the word of God. Di&s;coveries of a wonderful nature are made by the prophets in the&s;e &s;criptures, as a &s;tanding proof of their authenticity.</P>
<P>I &s;hall endeavour <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> to fix preci&s;e ideas to the term <HI>prophet,</HI> and <HI>prophecying,</HI> and &s;hall then produce, as a &s;pecimen, &s;ome prophecies that from the&s;e I may illu&s;trate the atte&s;tati|on given to our holy religion from prophecy in general.</P>
<P>The term <HI>prophet,</HI> is of Greek origin, &s;igni|fying to predict, or foretell. The corre&s;pond, ing terms in the Hebrew language expre&s;s the one, the man who &s;ees; the other the man who divines. Through that &s;upernatural impul&s;e, under which the prophets acted, they were en|abled to in&s;truct the people in their duty with preci&s;ion and authority. A hymn was &s;ome|times &s;ugge&s;ted to the mind &s;uitable for cele|brating the prai&s;e of the Almighty, which they could immediately clothe with words, and &s;et off with proper melodious tunes. When a number were together, the &s;ame thoughts ari&s;ing in their minds, and the &s;ame expre&s;&s;ions occurring, they, at one in&s;tant, in
<PB N="55" REF="53" MS="y">
the &s;ame words, poured forth the &s;ame prayer. Under this influence al&s;o, the prophet foretold future events. "Every one of you," &s;ays the apo&s;tle, of a chri&s;tian church under a divine in|&s;piration, <Q>hath a p&s;alm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an in|terpretation.</Q> Let it al&s;o be ob&s;erved, that when this extraordinary influence fell on every one, it frequently threw him into an ec&s;tacy, agitating and convul&s;ing the whole frame in an a&s;toni&s;hing manner. When any were thrown into a violent agitation, which gave them an unnatural frantic appearance, they were &s;aid to prophecy whatever was the cau&s;e of that agita|tion. As the heathen poets in&s;tructed their countrymen in religion, the apo&s;tles calls them prophets. When the minds of Saul and his &s;ervants were under &s;uch a &s;upernatural com|manding influence, that their ill de&s;igns again&s;t David were &s;u&s;pended, and every thought was ab&s;orbed in celebrating the prai&s;e of God, they are &s;aid to prophecy.</P>
<P>I have thus introduced my ob&s;ervations on prophecies, to remove the unea&s;ine&s;s which the ignorant and pre&s;umptuous a&s;&s;ertions of a late writer may have occa&s;ioned, who &s;ays that the bible, by a prophet, means a poet, and by pro|phecying, making ver&s;es. I &s;hould not even mention a&s;&s;ertions which might well di&s;grace any man of common &s;en&s;e, were it not that they receive currency, without examination,
<PB N="56" REF="54" MS="y">
becau&s;e the man by whom they are made, has, by his writings, in other in&s;tances, acquired among many, &s;ome reputation.</P>
<P>I now proceed to produce, as a &s;pecimen, &s;ome prophecies, that from the&s;e I may illu&s;|trate the atte&s;tation given to our holy religion from prophecy in general.</P>
<P>I begin with &s;peaking of the flood. Enoch's prophecy was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the antideluvian world for near a thou&s;and years; he foretold a great calamity, threatening the wicked, in which their wickedne&s;s &s;hould receive a &s;evere and examplary puni&s;hment. Noah illu&s;trated this prophecy, explaining its nature, and fixing preci&s;ely, the period when the puni&s;hment &s;hould be inflicted, one hundred and twenty years before that period arrived. No mind could penetrate &s;o far into futurity, far le&s;s could an event be conceived of, hitherto unexamplified, and altogether improbable. It was not a for|tunate conjecture in this venerable Antidelu|vian. He was certain that God had &s;poken to him, and was &s;o impre&s;&s;ed with the a&s;&s;ur|ance of the impending ruin, that he &s;et in ear|ne&s;t about providing for his own &s;afety. The Chaldean hi&s;torian, Bero&s;us, gives an account very corre&s;ponding to the Mo&s;aic. He &s;peaks of ten kings of Chaldea before the flood. Ten generations intervened between Adam and Noah. The la&s;t of the ten kings, &s;ays
<PB N="57" REF="55" MS="y">
Bero&s;us, was warned by a dream of a flood, and provided a ve&s;&s;el for his &s;afety.</P>
<P>Abraham had a di&s;tinct view of what &s;hould befall his de&s;cendants for a long &s;eries of years, <HI>Know,</HI> &s;ays the divine oracle, <HI>of a &s;urety, that thy &s;eed &s;hall be a &s;tranger in a land that is not theirs, and &s;hall &s;erve them; and they &s;hall afflict them four hundred years; and al&s;o that nation, whom they &s;hall &s;erve, will I judge: and afterward &s;hall they come out with great &s;ub|&s;tance. And thou &s;halt go to thy fathers in peace; thou &s;halt be buried in a good old age. But in the fourth generation they &s;hall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.</HI></P>
<P>Abraham's pro&s;pects were good. His cha|racter was re&s;pectable, and his circum&s;tances wealthy. An eye le&s;s penetrating than the divine, could not have fore&s;een the&s;e chang|es through which his po&s;terity &s;hould pa&s;s.</P>
<P>Mo&s;es re&s;ts the whole credit of his law on two circum&s;tances, in them&s;elves more than doubtful, which no prudent per&s;on, much le&s;s an experienced legi&s;lator, would have done, had he not acted under divine authority. Every male was required to repair thrice a year, to Jeru&s;alem; every &s;eventh year the lands mu&s;t lie uncultivated. In the ordinary cour&s;e of things, the enemies with whom they were environed would take that opportunity
<PB N="58" REF="56">
of laying wa&s;te their lands. Famine would be introduced by &s;o unprecedented a practice, but God a&s;&s;ured them, from the exact knowledge he had of all hearts, whether then in exi&s;tence, or to come into exi&s;tence at the appointed pe|riod, that when obeying his command, no man &s;hould de&s;ire their land, and that the earth, by an abundance on the &s;ixth year, un|known in the other five, &s;hould afford a full &s;upply for the &s;ucceeding, &s;o as to enable them with great &s;afety, to &s;ubmit to the divine re|qui&s;ition. What a minute acquaintance with the hearts of men, and with natural cau&s;es; and what a controuling power over them, in the coming, as well as the exi&s;ting generation, to re&s;t the whole weight of the Mo&s;aic oeco|nomy, on &s;uch a circum&s;tance. An under|&s;tanding which was not infinite, could never have penetrated the &s;ecrets of the heart, as well as tho&s;e of nature: nor would common prudence have allowed Mo&s;es to ri&s;k his reputation on what, had it been a cheat, might &s;o frequently have been expo&s;ed. I have fixed your atten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|on to what appears to me a &s;tanding miracle, as well as a &s;tanding prophecy, in atte&s;tation of the divine authority of the Mo&s;aic law.</P>
<P>The captivity of the Jews in Babylon, and the preci&s;e period of its duration had been foretold long before it took place, nay, the very name and victories of the deliverer had
<PB N="59" REF="57" MS="y">
one hundred and fifty years previous to his birth, been mentioned in the prophecy of I&s;ai|ah. <HI>Seventy</HI> years were fixed upon for the captivity, and Cyrus was named as the in&s;tru|ment in the hand of providence for the re&s;tora|tion of the Jews; nothing was left uncertain in this prophecy. It was read to Cyrus after he became head of the Babylonian empire, for he mentions it in the decree which gave the Jews their liberty, and no doubt it had its weight in determining him to &s;uch an act. This cir|cum&s;tance &s;hews the exi&s;tance of the prophe|cy among the Jews, a long time previou&s;ly to the events to which it refers. Now was the period according to that prophecy, when God &s;hould deliver his people; and Cyrus was the in&s;trument which he &s;hould employ. The devout Jews could never have dreamed of &s;uch a deliverance had it not been foretold, nor would any have had the boldne&s;s to im|po&s;e a forgery upon Cyrus; or if they had, his known wi&s;dom had rendered &s;uch an impo&s;i|tion very vain. If hi&s;tory, in any in&s;tance, de&s;erves credibility, it does in this, that &s;uch a prophecy did exi&s;t, and has in the minute&s;t circum&s;tances, been exactly accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>The prophecies of Daniel are plain, and deci&s;ive. I cannot be particular on this &s;ub|ject. I &s;hall mention one circum&s;tance. Alexander, deliberating on his expedition again&s;t Per&s;ia, was encouraged in a dream, by
<PB N="60" REF="58" MS="y">
a man, in a dre&s;s which was new to him, who a&s;&s;ured him of &s;ucce&s;s. He had entered on the expedition when he found it nece&s;&s;ary to puni&s;h the Jews who adhered to Per&s;ia. On his march again&s;t Jeru&s;alem, he was met by the high prie&s;t in his robes; the very per&s;on, and in the very robes &s;een in his dream. The appearance diverted him from the vengeance which he had determined to take. He did reverence to the high prie&s;t, and offered &s;acri|fices in the temple. The prophecies of Da|niel were &s;hewn him, which predict, in the mo&s;t circum&s;tantial manner, the overthrow of the Per&s;ian empire. They in&s;pired him with confidence in his undertaking. The Jews who were entru&s;ted with the&s;e prophecies he honored, and granted them every indulgence which they could wi&s;h&mdash;nay, Porphery, a learned and ingenius philo&s;opher, in the third century, and the mo&s;t formidable and embit|tered enemy, with whom chri&s;tianity ever &s;truggled, was &s;o convinced of the exact ful|filment of the prophecies of Daniel, that he could no otherwi&s;e evade the argument thence in favour of our holy religion, than by ab&s;urd|ly &s;uppo&s;ing, in the face of the mo&s;t inconte&s;t|able evidence, that the&s;e were written, under the name of Daniel by &s;ome per&s;on, at a late period, after the events, &s;aid to be foretold, had come to pa&s;s. Prophecies &s;o unequivocal, &s;o circum&s;tantial, &s;o plain, to which even ene|mies give their atte&s;tation, are a proof of the
<PB N="61" REF="59" MS="y">
divine authority of &s;criptures which cannot be invalidated.</P>
<P>Our Saviour's prediction concerning Jeru|&s;alem, de&s;erves great attention. Its overthrow is foretold;&mdash;it &s;hould be an entire overthrow, and take place whil&s;t the pre&s;ent generation yet exi&s;ted. Pre&s;ages of its approach are &s;pe|cified. Directions are given to tho&s;e who, when the&s;e appeared, would &s;ecure their per&s;o|nal &s;afety. Let any con&s;iderate per&s;on read our Saviour's prophecy in the twenty-fourth chap|ter of Matthew, and at the &s;ame time look at Jo&s;ephus's account of the de&s;truction of Jeru&s;a|lem, and he will certainly be convinced, that our Saviour had the mo&s;t exact knowledge of what afterwards took place, and gave a mi|nute and intelligible prediction.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t appear to every one who con&s;iders how circum&s;tantially all the&s;e prophecies have been given, that an opponent of revelation, who has lately come into view, di&s;covers a ra&s;hne&s;s and ignorance, which is truly pitiable, when he &s;peaks of prophecies as delivered in &s;uch equivocal language, as to fit almo&s;t any circum&s;tance that might happen afterwards, and deridingly adds, "that &s;hooting with a long bow of a thou&s;and years, to &s;trike within a thou&s;and miles of a mark, the ingenuity of po&s;terity could make it point blank." Nei|ther groundle&s;s a&s;&s;ertions, nor loud laughs,
<PB N="62" REF="60" MS="y">
can command any authority with tho&s;e who &s;eriou&s;ly enquire after the truth.</P>
<P>I &s;hall call your attention to one prophe|cy more, but which, from its great impor|tance, and the illu&s;trations which it repeatedly receives, may be con&s;idered as the leading pro|phecy of &s;cripture, it re&s;pects the Me&s;&s;iah, in who&s;e appearance and character all; whither Jews or Gentiles, are nearly concerned. He is &s;poken of as the de&s;ire of all nations, who, de&s;troying the works of the devil, &s;hould in|troduce univer&s;al righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace. Adam knew him as the &s;eed of the woman; I&s;aiah as the &s;on of a virgin. David as a king, who&s;e thrown would be e&s;tabli&s;hed forever; Daniel as cut off, for the benefit of others; Micah as putting an end to inju&s;tice and war; Malachi as purifying the &s;ons of Levi, that they might offer unto the Lord an offering in righteou&s;ne&s;s. The former di&s;pen&s;ation, and the various changes in the &s;tate of empires, all tended to make way for the Me&s;&s;iah, and to introduce his government. The moment when he &s;hould appear, and enter on the exe|cution of his office, was preci&s;ely fixed. Four hundred years from Cyrus's decree, in favour of the Jews, brought forward the happy mo|ment, to which the eyes of all were directed. The prophecy was &s;o plain, and circum&s;tanti|al, that all the world were about this time looking out for &s;ome illu&s;trious per&s;onage, from whom they expected great advantages.
<PB N="63" REF="61" MS="y">
The Jews were enquiring after him who was to come: the gentiles were expecting the return of the golden age. Virgil's fourth epi|logue &s;trongly expre&s;&s;es this expectation. How the expectation was rai&s;ed, cannot &s;o ea&s;ily be a&s;certained. It might from the &s;criptures them&s;elves, which were in &s;uch cir|culation, that the inqui&s;itive had it in their power to peru&s;e them, or from the Sibylline oracles over which evil demons pre&s;ided; but which, occa&s;ionally were con&s;trained to give an unwilling atte&s;tation to the truth. Virgil was not &s;ingular in his expectation. Both Suetonius, and Tacitus mention a prevailing opinion, derived from their &s;acred writings that about this time, &s;ome from Judea &s;hould obtain the government. Virgil took the ad|vantage of this &s;tate of men's minds to com|pliment his patron, the con&s;ul A&s;inius Polico, at the birth of his &s;on Saloninus, as if this were the per&s;on promi&s;ed to ble&s;s the nations. That in both Jews and Gentiles, an unu&s;ual expectation was excited, is certain. It is equally certain that their views were too gro&s;s, and earthly. The per&s;on expected came, but &s;o different from what their imagi|nations painted, that to the Jews he was a &s;tumbling-block, and to the Greeks fooli&s;h|ne&s;s. But he did not live and die in vain. He has e&s;tabli&s;hed a kingdom on earth. Op|po&s;ition it has met with, and &s;hall meet with, but it &s;hall &s;tand, it &s;hall increa&s;e, it &s;hall be|come
<PB N="64" REF="62" MS="y">
univer&s;al. Of this the book of revelati|on makes us certain: per&s;ons ver&s;ed in the&s;e kinds of &s;tudies, know well that many things therein foretold, have been accompli&s;hed; ma|ny things are now accompli&s;hing, even that infidelity, which now &s;o generally prevails, is con&s;onant to what has been fore&s;een, and confirms the prediction, but when the whole &s;hall be accompli&s;hed, Chri&s;t indeed &s;hall reign on earth, and re&s;tore to mankind the innocen|cy and happine&s;s of the paradi&s;ical &s;tate.</P>
<P>The prophecies of &s;cripture are not deliver|ed in the &s;ame language, as facts. Lifting too high the awful veil which conceals futuri|ty, mu&s;t, in many in&s;tances, have been impro|per, neither are the&s;e prophecies couched in terms which might be accommodated to what|ever &s;hould happen. There are certain prin|ciples by which the prophetic language may be determined. The language of the prophe|cies which have been accompli&s;hed, with the events which were in view, mu&s;t be contra&s;t|ed with the language of the prophecies yet to be accompli&s;hed, whence &s;ome idea may be formed of what is to be expected. An attentive examination of &s;cripture language, with an ac|curate acquaintance with hi&s;tory, is nece&s;&s;ary, in order to pur&s;ue profitably inquiries of this na|ture. Thus Daniel found out that the deliverance of his people was at hand. The Jews thus could a&s;certain when the Me&s;&s;iah &s;hould make his
<PB N="65" REF="63" MS="y">
appearance. Mr. Fleming who &s;earched af|ter prophetic knowledge, writing about an hundred years ago, was certain from the reve|lation of John, that a revolution would take place in France, previou&s;ly to the year 1794. Different writers have lately treated the &s;ub|ject of prophecies with great &s;agacity. No knowledge of any kind, can be acquired with|out pains. It argues great ra&s;hne&s;s to pro|nounce on &s;ubjects with which we have no acquaintance. It is ea&s;y for an ignorant per|&s;on to &s;ay that none can acquire information with re&s;pect to the planets and their motions. Such a&s;&s;ertions, however, no ways affect the&s;e &s;tudies. It is the &s;ame with prophecy. If a a man has never turned his thoughts that way, he may pronounce them <HI>enigmatical,</HI> and <HI>trifling:</HI> but it is not a proof of a con&s;iderate per&s;on, to make &s;uch a&s;&s;ertions until he exa|mines into the matter, le&s;t he expo&s;e, at once, his folly and rancour at revelation.</P>
<P>What a glorious atte&s;tation do prophecies afford our holy religion. A mind le&s;s com|prehen&s;ive than divine, could never view events &s;o various, &s;o contingent, &s;o di&s;tant in time and place, with &s;uch exactne&s;s, and mark them out as circum&s;tantially as if they were pre&s;ent. Di&s;coveries of this nature are made in &s;cripture. As the events which are foretold come for|ward, they afford new and irre&s;i&s;tible evidences of the truth of revelations. That &s;cripture has this &s;eal of heaven, is not the belief of
<PB N="66" REF="64" MS="y">
weak and credulous minds only, but al&s;o of the mo&s;t di&s;cerning. Sir I&s;aac Newton, to whom we are indebted for our acquaintance with the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem, was &s;o well a&s;&s;ured of the truth of prophecies, that he has illu&s;trated them by a judicious and u&s;eful commentary. Our holy religion po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es atte&s;tations of the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory nature, but man will not take the trouble to examine the&s;e, it is not their wi&s;h that revelation be true, and they &s;peak according to their wi&s;hes. Such conduct is common in our age. It is a crime of an aggra|vated nature. It cries for vengeance. The time has been, when the enemies of our religion were una&s;hamed of their oppo&s;ition, and could ven|ture to carry it on in the dark only, and in an underhanded manner; now they a&s;&s;ert their un|founded &s;y&s;tems, and daring bla&s;phemies, open|ly, in the mo&s;t frequented companies, and even in public prints. It is very &s;trange that the friends of revelation cannot amu&s;e them&s;elves with the tran&s;actions of the day, without al&s;o being &s;hocked with &s;illy ideas at what they ac|count mo&s;t &s;acred, and of higher moment than even life, or any of its enjoyments. It will be nece&s;&s;ary for them, if &s;uch practices continue, to unite in denying them&s;elves an in|nocent and proper amu&s;ement, rather than be repeatedly wounded by attacks upon religion of the mo&s;t in&s;olent and offen&s;ive kind. Were the &s;ubject ea&s;ily and rationally di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, the friends of religion are always ready to meet
<PB N="67" REF="65" MS="y">
any on this ground, and to give an account of the faith which is in them; but running into un&s;upported a&s;&s;ertions, virulent reproaches, and in&s;olent &s;corn, neither their inclination, their honor, nor their religion, allow them to meet any on &s;uch ground.</P>
<P>I am per&s;uaded every &s;erious enquirer will be impre&s;&s;ed with the atte&s;tations given to our holy religion, others, as they do not de&s;ire to know the truth, mu&s;t &s;tand to all the con&s;e|quences of remaining in ignorance.</P>
<P>Having now illu&s;trated the glorious atte&s;ta|tion afforded our holy religion from prophecy, I ought next to &s;hew the atte&s;tation given it from miracles.</P>

<P>Then Simon him&s;elf believed al&s;o: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and &s;igns which were done.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT has univer&s;ally been expected that men, acting under divine authority, &s;hould confirm their preten&s;ions by &s;ome miracles. The nature of miracles may be better under|&s;tood by bringing &s;ome in view, than by any definition. They commanded from Philip, preaching the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, among the Sa|maritans, attention and belief; nay, not from the Samaritans only, but from Simon him&s;elf, who was profoundly ver&s;ed in every &s;pecies of deceit which could impo&s;e upon mankind, but of &s;uch powers as Philip po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, he had no idea. <Q>Simon him&s;elf believed al&s;o, and
<PB N="69" REF="67" MS="y">
when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and &s;igns which were done.</Q></P>
<P>It is evidently deducible from the&s;e words, that miracles are a proper atte&s;tation to the &s;cripture, and that tho&s;e which are true, have an intrin&s;ic value, of which others are de&s;titute. I &s;hall, at pre&s;ent attempt, through divine a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, the illu&s;tration of both the&s;e particulars. I &s;hall offer no definitions, nor lay down nice di&s;tinctions. I &s;hall &s;imply &s;tate, a few facts, and then draw &s;ome conclu&s;ions.</P>
<P>Before the days of Mo&s;es, miracles are no where mentioned. They were not previou&s;ly known, nor was it nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould. The nearer we approach the beginning of the world, the more &s;implicity appears. Of God's revealing him&s;elf to mankind no doubt was entertained. In &s;ucceeding ages the original tradition became more ob&s;cure and men's imaginations vain. They could not confine them&s;elves to the &s;imple truth, fir&s;t it was <HI>di&s;gui&s;ed,</HI> then <HI>que&s;tioned,</HI> and at la&s;t <HI>denied.</HI> This was the &s;tate of things in Egypt. Mo|&s;es could not gain credit, on his own te&s;timo|ny, that God had &s;poken to him in the bu&s;h. Pharaoh demanded &s;ome proof of his acting un|der divine authority, which might exceed whatever could be effected by the deepe&s;t re|&s;earches into nature: with this Mo&s;es compli|ed.
<PB N="70" REF="68">
He wrought miracles of various kinds; a controuling power was di&s;covered over all the elements. The air was turned into dark|ne&s;s, of &s;o uncommon a nature, that they could neither kindle any fire, nor keep any flame alive. It di&s;tracted the timorous, and agitated the mo&s;t undaunted. The hail was dreadful; and the fire withered every thing green; an odious &s;warm was produced; and the mo&s;t pernicious in&s;ects invaded the land; di&s;ea&s;es fell upon the body; the river turned into blood, could not be drunk; the fir&s;t-born of men and bea&s;t died; and a rod thrown on the ground was changed into a hi&s;&s;ing en|venomed &s;erpent. In all this there could be no trick nor collu&s;ion. No power but the di|vine could put out the &s;un, or awake the thun|der; could arm in&s;ects with mi&s;chief, and the lightning with death; could afflict men, in their per&s;ons, and in all their comforts, could change the helpful &s;taff into the envenomed &s;erpent; or removing the&s;e calmities at his plea&s;ure, render men ea&s;y in their minds, and &s;afe in their circum&s;tances. Realize Egypt at this awful cri&s;is; think of the judgements which came upon them, in a gradual &s;ucce&s;&s;i|on, and each more formidable than the other, let it be particularly marked, that Go&s;hen, where the I&s;raelites re&s;ided, was perfectly ex|empted from every plague. Dark in Egypt, it was light in Go&s;hen. The Egyptians were &s;ick and dying; not one &s;ickly among the I&s;ra|elites,
<PB N="71" REF="69" MS="y">
nor in any danger: when fire and hail, when in&s;ects of various kinds were de&s;tructive to the ma&s;ter, the &s;lave, free from de&s;truction, dwelt in &s;afety. Having &s;uch a view, could you have he&s;itated one moment? Was not the hand of God evidently di&s;tingui&s;hable? Was not Mo&s;es the &s;ervant of the mo&s;t high? Did he not act under a divine commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The&s;e operations were new, and Pharaoh was willing to a&s;certain their nature; he called in his magicians to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Their character and preten&s;ions are not well known. Jannes and Jambres are named by the apo&s;tle, as with&s;tanding Mo&s;es. Pliny, the natural hi&s;torian, mentions the former of the&s;e in con|junction with Mo&s;es; and Numenius, the philo&s;opher, mentions both of them, in the &s;ame conjunction, as celebrated magicians. In &s;everal miracles they were &s;ucce&s;sful. They produced frogs; turned the water into blood, and their rods into &s;erpents. It is evi|dent from the &s;cripture, that the wor&s;hippers of idols were the wor&s;hippers of devils. The power of the&s;e fallen &s;pirits, is certainly great, It was now exerted to the utmo&s;t. The ma|gicians knew not whether their attempt would &s;ucceed. Whatever their enchantments were, the effect was doubtful. They made the at|tempt where they failed, as well as where they &s;ucceeded. The conte&s;t was between the power of fallen &s;pirits and the divine pow|er. The i&s;&s;ue might have been expected.
<PB N="72" REF="70">
The divine power was gloriou&s;ly triumphant, The other's under controul, was checked in the beginning of its &s;ucce&s;s, and could prevail for mi&s;chief only. The magicians could avert none of the judgments introduced by Mo&s;es; and as &s;oon as they were un&s;ucce&s;sful, they dropped any further attempt, acknowledging the finger of God; after this Pharaoh no more &s;ought their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; the point was decided. The miracles of Mo&s;es were done by the Al|mighty, and bore the &s;eal of heaven to the commi&s;&s;ion of his &s;ervant. If per&s;ons on the &s;pot, who knew the whole mi&s;tery of deceit, and had at &s;take intere&s;t and reputation, could Mo&s;es have been made out an impo&s;tor, were con&s;trained to declare that God did by him works which exceeded the reach of human power, in league with fellow &s;pirits, I cannot &s;ee how a different opinion can be entertained by even infidelity it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Could we fix our attention entirely to what the &s;criptures relate, and impre&s;s our minds with their credibility, we mu&s;t often be a&s;to|ni&s;hed. Suppo&s;e a va&s;t multitude on the banks of the Potowmack, their enemies pre&s;s upon them with an armed force, which cannot be re&s;i&s;ted. In this di&s;tre&s;s, imagine that the &s;tream divides, the waters ri&s;e on each &s;ide, forming a wall, a path being left dry between, through which the multitude may pa&s;s. Pa&s;|&s;ed over, they look back upon the enemy in
<PB N="73" REF="71" MS="y">
eager ha&s;te, pur&s;uing through this unu&s;ual tract.&mdash;I &s;ee the waters on either hand break in, and drown the embattled ho&s;ts. Could you avoid a&s;cribing all to the Almighty, and acknowledging that he di&s;tingui&s;hes between the oppre&s;&s;or, and the oppre&s;&s;ed? This is no imaginary &s;cene. It was experienced &s;oon after the I&s;raelites left Eygpt, to admit them to the wilderne&s;s, and again forty years having elap&s;ed, that they might enter the land pro|mi&s;ed their fathers. The fir&s;t in&s;tance has been greatly di&s;gui&s;ed both by Jo&s;ephus the Jew, and writers from among the Gentiles, but the miracle is undoubted, and was well adapted to confirm the I&s;raelites in their obe|dience to God. And to warn the &s;urviving Egyptians that there was no contending with the mo&s;t high. In this al&s;o they could not be deceived. The I&s;raelites pa&s;&s;ed through the channel, they &s;aw with their eyes, the waters on either hand. The &s;pray fell upon them like a thick mi&s;t, which &s;ugge&s;ted to the apo&s;|tle the idea of their being baptized unto Mo|&s;es in the &s;ea, on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, when looking back, they found the enemy buried in the deep: impo&s;ition in this in&s;tance was im|po&s;&s;ible. It was evident to the &s;en&s;es of thou|&s;ands. If their &s;eeing, hearing, or feeling, could be credited, all was real; God had indeed appeared in their behalf, and manife&s;ted evi|dently his power and glory.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="72" MS="y">A mixed multitude, con&s;i&s;ting of many thou&s;ands were not likely to &s;ub&s;i&s;t long in a wilderne&s;s, unimproved with food, with rai|ment or any nece&s;&s;ary. Yet in this &s;ame wil|derne&s;s, the va&s;t multitude &s;ub&s;i&s;ted for forty years, without cultivating the ground, without commerce, without manufactories. In the or|dinary cour&s;e of things, it could not have been. It was one continued miracle. Their cloth|ing and food were miraculou&s;ly provided. They wanted nothing, and yet nothing came in the ordinary way. They were under an immediate divine conduct. The command of God denounced by Mo&s;es, and di&s;covered in the motions of the wonderful cloud directed their journeyings, or encampments. He fed them from heaven, pre&s;erved them in vigor, and prevented their clothes from wearing out. The&s;e facts are as well atte&s;ted, as any hi&s;tori|cal facts can be, and they gave an a&s;toni&s;hing di&s;covery of the power and goodne&s;s of God.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not in&s;i&s;t on many others of a like nature, it is enough to ob&s;erve that the&s;e were mo&s;t common in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Jew|i&s;h oeconomy, although never altogether want|ing. In Babylon a few miracles are on re|cord, whereby the Jews were vindicated in the belief, and wor&s;hip of the living and the true God. The pre&s;ervation of the three children in the fiery furnace, and of Daniel in the li|on's
<PB N="75" REF="73">
den; the puni&s;hment of Nebuchadnezzar, and his remarkable recovery, greatly tended to advance the honour of Jehovah's name, among the idolatrous nations. The&s;e facts were all well a&s;certained, done in the pre&s;ence of a pro|digious concour&s;e of all ranks and characters, and had a great effect, procuring different de|crees from the mo&s;t haughty and idolatrous monarchs on earth, enjoining wor&s;hip and obe|dience to the Mo&s;t High.</P>
<P>As the Jewi&s;h di&s;pen&s;ation was e&s;tabli&s;hed by miracles, &s;o was the Chri&s;tian. The ex|pected Me&s;&s;iah appearing, was plea&s;ed for three years, to take upon him&s;elf a public cha|racter. Every day he employed for the benefit of mankind. He relieved all who applied to him. He gave to the blind their fight, and to the deaf their hearing. His creative power re&s;tored to the high prie&s;t's &s;ervant the ear which Peter had &s;mitten off; and to many their deficient members; he rai&s;ed from the dead a widow's &s;on at Naen, and his friend Lazarus at Bethany. The mo&s;t inveterate lunacy and afflictive po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion yielded to his command. He calmed the raging of the &s;ea, and multiplied a few loaves, and fi&s;hes to &s;a|tisfy an hungry concour&s;e. He e&s;caped from the enraged Nazarenes, they knew not how; and by a word, perhaps a commanding look, laid his enemies pro&s;trate at his feet. The&s;e things were not done in private, nor were they
<PB N="76" REF="74">
&s;eldom repeated. They were done in the mo&s;t frequented places, and multiplied daily. His enemies did not, could not deny what was done, whatever con&s;truction their perver&s;e minds put upon them, and his attendants in a&s;toni&s;hment in&s;i&s;ted, <Q>when Chri&s;t cometh will he do more miracles than the&s;e, which this man hath done.</Q> Nicodemus acknow|ledged, <Q>that no man can do the&s;e miracles which thou doe&s;t, except God be with him.</Q> And a man who had been born blind, but re|covered his &s;ight, declared before the Jewi&s;h Sanhedrim with great &s;implicity of heart, <HI>Why, herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes. Now, we know that God heareth not &s;in|ners: but if any man be a wor&s;hipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth. Since the world began was it not heard, that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind. If this man were not of God, he could do nothing. They an|&s;wered and &s;aid unto him, thou wa&s;t altogether born in &s;ins, and do&s;t thou teach us? And they ca&s;t him out.</HI></P>
<P>Nay, my brethren, not only were the&s;e things done by our Lord him&s;elf, but his de&s;ciples were empowered by him to do the &s;ame things in his name, and this power continued with them for more than two hundred years. Among other extraordinary endowments, they were enabled in&s;tantaneou&s;ly to &s;peak the lan|guage
<PB N="77" REF="75" MS="y">
of any nation, as fluently as if they had been natives, and if I mi&s;take not, a &s;pecimen of this power remains in the church, the New Te&s;tament having been written originally in Greek, by tho&s;e who were native Jews, and had no opportunity of acquiring in the ordina|ry cour&s;e of things, any acquaintance with a foreign language. I find a circum&s;tance much in&s;i&s;ted on by Mr. Addi&s;on, and which he con&s;iders, and very ju&s;tly, as a &s;triking miracle. I mean the fortitude, and per&s;everance with which the young, and the old; the feeble and the robu&s;t; the high and the low &s;ubmitted to lingering, and &s;evere tortures, when a renunci|ation of chri&s;tianity, or, in &s;ome in&s;tances, &s;i|lence only, would have prevented the&s;e &s;everi|ties, or immediately have interrupted them. Human nature could not have held out without uncommon a&s;&s;i&s;tance from above. This was frequently acknowledged; Stephen beheld his Saviour ready to receive his departing &s;pirit, others have been &s;trengthened by an angel. The&s;e facts were of &s;uch notoriety, that even enemies have not ventured to call them in que&s;tion. They are a glorious atte&s;tation to our holy religion. The more they are exa|mined, the more they mu&s;t impre&s;s the mind.</P>
<P>Enemies have in different ways attempted to le&s;&s;on their weight. They mention a mi|racle wrought by Ve&s;pa&s;ian, the emperor, who
<PB N="78" REF="76" MS="y">
touching the eyes of a blind man, re&s;tored him to &s;ight; allowing this, which is not fully a&s;|certained, God might hereby put honour on a man who, in conjunction with his &s;on Titus, was appointed his in&s;trument to puni&s;h the Jews. The philo&s;opher Apollonius is of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en mentioned by the enemies of our holy religi|on, as a rival in doing miracles, to our Saviour. Producing &s;uch a rival&s;hip, is a tacit acknow|ment that our Saviour did miracles, with re&s;|pect to Apollonius: many things &s;aid to be done by him, are very ridiculous, and whatever he did, they are vouched by a weak and credu|lous per&s;on only, his &s;ervant Damis. But what are the&s;e, when compared to the mira|cles of our Saviour who, publicly, &s;ubjected to every degree of examination, did more mira|cles in three years, than Mo&s;es and all the prophets put together, and continued this pow|er &s;ome ages with the church.</P>
<P>That &s;ome things may be impo&s;ed upon men as miracles which are not, is generally granted in &s;cripture. Simon Magus, &s;poken of in my text, before Philip's arrival in Sama|ria, u&s;ed &s;orcery, <HI>But there was a certain man called Simon, which beforetime in the &s;ame city u&s;ed &s;orcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that him&s;elf was &s;ome great one, to whom they all gave heed, from the lea&s;t to the greate&s;t, &s;aying, This man is the great power of God. And to him they had regard, becau&s;e that of long time he had bewitched them with &s;orceries.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="77" MS="y">In Philippi, as the apo&s;tles went to pray, <HI>as we went to prayer, a certain dam&s;el po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed with a &s;pirit of divination met us, which brought her ma&s;ters much gain by &s;ooth&s;aying: The &s;ame followed Paul and us, and cried, &s;aying, The&s;e men are the &s;ervants of the mo&s;t high God, which &s;hew unto us the way of &s;alvation. And this did &s;he many days. But Paul being grieved, turned, and &s;aid to the &s;pirit, I command thee, in the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to come out of her. And he came out the &s;ame hour. And when her ma&s;ters &s;ow that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the market-place unto the rulers.</HI></P>
<P>It is evident that this girl was under an evil influence, and thereby enabled by her di&s;cove|ries and actions, to a&s;toni&s;h the people, but the power under which &s;he acted, could not re&s;i&s;t the command of the apo&s;tle, &s;peaking in his ma&s;ter's name. The &s;cripture expre&s;sly fore|tels, that, <HI>That wicked &s;hall be revealed, whom the Lord &s;hall con&s;ume with the &s;pirit of his mouth, and &s;hall de&s;troy with the brightne&s;s of his coming: even him, who&s;e coming is after the working of Satan, with all power and &s;igns, and lying won|ders. And with all deceivablene&s;s of unrighteou&s;|ne&s;s in them that peri&s;h; becau&s;e they received not the love of the truth, that they might be &s;aved. And for this cau&s;e God &s;hall &s;end them &s;trong de|lu&s;ion, that they &s;hould believe a lie; that they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had plea&s;ure in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s. But we are bound
<PB N="80" REF="78" MS="y">
to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren, belov|ed of the Lord, becau&s;e he hath from the beginning cho&s;en you to &s;alvation through &s;anctification of the &s;pirit, and belief of the truth.</HI></P>
<P>Wonderful things may, according to the&s;e pa&s;|&s;ages be done, and of a nature too that, were it po&s;&s;ible they could deceive even the elect. The &s;cripture a&s;cribes the&s;e to evil &s;pirits. They &s;eek the &s;hade, and confirm men in their for|getfulne&s;s of God, or in a depraved or cor|rupted conduct; they have always yielded to true miracles, which di&s;pel the&s;e mi&s;ts, and encourages regard for God, and purity in heart and life. In this world impo&s;itions of differ|ent kinds are practiced. The&s;e render no per|&s;on of con&s;ideration &s;ceptics, neither ought coun|terfeits in religion, to render them infidels. True miracles are done openly, in the face of the &s;un, to the conviction of our &s;en&s;es, and are wrought by per&s;ons of character and piety, to confirm men in the pure&s;t doctrines, and the mo&s;t glorious hopes. Fal&s;e miracles are few and concealed; they avoid in&s;pection, and reconcile men to their evil habits and practices. The&s;e are plain di&s;tingui&s;hing rules; applied to the miracles of &s;cripture, they di&s;cover their veracity. They are the atte&s;tati|on of heaven to our holy religion. Mo&s;es's miracles became the more con&s;picuous and uncontroverted, in con&s;equence of oppo&s;ition from Pharaoh's magicians; Philip's confirma|tion to the go&s;pel, in con&s;equence of Simon's

&s;orceries; the excellency and &s;tability of the truth, in con&s;equence of the errors and fal&s;e|hoods which ari&s;e.</P>
<P>Our Saviour appeals to his miracles, in at|te&s;tation of his character, and urges upon the Jews the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of their unbelief, having &s;uch an evidence of his coming from God <Q>If I had not done among them the works which none other did, they had not had &s;in, but now have they both &s;een, and hat|ed both me and my father.</Q> What God had done before the I&s;raelites, is recapitulated as a new motive to obedience. <HI>Know you that day,</HI> &s;ays Mo&s;es, <HI>for I &s;peak not with your children which have not known, and which have not &s;een the cha&s;ti&s;ement of the Lord your God, his greatne&s;s, his mighty hand, and his &s;tretched out arm, and his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the mid&s;t of Egypt, unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto his land; and what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their hor&s;es, and to their chariots: how he made the waters of the Red Sea to overflow them as they pur&s;ued after you, and how the Lord hath de&s;troyed them unto this day.</HI></P>
<P>It is not nece&s;&s;ary that &s;uch miracles be continued; well authenticated, they have the &s;ame weight with remote ages, as with the pre&s;ent, a&s;&s;uring them that the di&s;pen&s;ation which they atte&s;t, is from God.

<P>THE alarming events which are re|lated in this chapter, or which may be collect|ed from the other evangeli&s;ts, who &s;peak of our Saviour's crucifixion and death, made deep impre&s;&s;ion on the mind of the Roman of|ficer commanding the guard at his execution.

<P>Explaining the nature of the events to which our text has an immediate re&s;pect, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to view them in order, that each may receive proper attention.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing of which I take notice, is the darkne&s;s which over&s;pread the land for <HI>three</HI> hours. This darkne&s;s was very remarkable: It happened at full moon, when that body could not be interpo&s;ed between our earth and the &s;un, which is fully a&s;certained to be the cau&s;e of eclip&s;es, and con&s;equently the appear|ance cannot be accounted for on any known principle, but mu&s;t be con&s;idered as &s;upernatu|ral and miraculous.</P>
<P>No eclip&s;e can be total for &s;o long a &s;pace as three hours; nor can it, at the &s;ame in&s;tant, embrace the whole hemi&s;phere in its &s;hade, as the account we have in the evangeli&s;ts, and
<PB N="85" REF="83" MS="y">
the te&s;timony of &s;ome profane authors lead us to &s;uppo&s;e happened in the ca&s;e before us: all which con&s;iderations make the pre&s;ent appear|ance the more amazing, and oblige us in ac|counting for it, to have recour&s;e to the imme|diate interpo&s;ition and power of God. He who kindled the &s;un at fir&s;t, and appointed him to rule the day, can ea&s;ily extingui&s;h his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ires at plea&s;ure, or withhold his cheering influ|ence. The exertion of &s;uch power then was every way &s;uitable to the tran&s;action of that important day. It was a &s;ign from heaven, after which the Jews had always been &s;o anxi|ous in proof of our Saviour's mi&s;&s;ion. It was a token of di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t the Jews for &s;hutting their eyes to other evidences of this, which were fully convincing, and for allowing their blindne&s;s and malice to hurry them on to &s;uch dangerous lengths. It was al&s;o a lively emblem of the &s;truggle which the Lord of na|ture now underwent with the powers of dark|ne&s;s, and of the bitterne&s;s of di&s;tre&s;s which overwhelmed his &s;pirit.</P>
<P>The &s;econd thing of which I take notice, is "the earthquake." Of this my text makes particular mention, and the rending of the rocks, which was po&s;&s;ibly a con&s;equence of the earthquake; according to &s;ome, this &s;hock was generally felt through the world: Ac|cording to others, it was perceivable in Judea only, or in the places near where our Saviour
<PB N="86" REF="84" MS="y">
was put to death. Be this as it may, it was certainly attended with very terrible circum|&s;tances, agitating the ground to the very &s;pot on which the temple &s;tood, tearing the neigh|bouring rocks a&s;under in an alarming manner, and leaving in that opening a monument of this event to &s;ucceeding ages. An earthquake is one of the mo&s;t dreadful <HI>phenomena</HI> of na|ture. Sometimes it indicates that God is at hand. <HI>The &s;ea &s;aw it, and fled; Jordan was driven back. The mountains &s;kipped like rams and the little hills like lambs. What ailed thee, O thou &s;ea, that thou flede&s;t? Thou Jordan, that thou wa&s;t driven back? Ye mountains, that ye &s;kip|ped like rams; and ye little hills like lambs? Trem|ble, thou earth, at the pre&s;ence of the Lord, at the pre&s;ence of the God of Jacob.</HI> At other times, it indicates the divine wrath, coming to relieve his &s;ervant from the oppre&s;&s;ion of his enemies; at God's appearance, <HI>The earth &s;hook and trembled; the foundations al&s;o of the hills moved and were &s;haken, becau&s;e he was wroth. There went up a &s;moke out of his no&s;trils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.</HI> Of both the divine pre&s;ence, and di&s;plea&s;ure was this earthquake expre&s;&s;ive. It pointed out the eminence of the &s;ufferer, he was the &s;on of God, and Saviour of the world. Much indignity had been done him.

<P>The third thing of which I take notice, is that <Q>the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.</Q> This veil was a hanging of the riche&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t tape&s;try, which &s;eperated the holy from the mo&s;t holy place: Being now the time of the evening &s;a|crifice, and upon a &s;olemn occa&s;ion, when the high prie&s;t, probably Caiaphas him&s;elf, was mi|ni&s;tring at the golden altar, and burning in|cen&s;e, this veil was, by an invi&s;ible power, rent in two in the mid&s;t, from the top to the very bottom, whereby the &s;acred oracle was laid open to full view. This was an awful and &s;ignificant &s;ign, particularly &s;uited to rou&s;e the con&s;ciences of the Jews, and convince them that their per&s;ecution of Je&s;us unto death, was offen&s;ive unto God, who would now aboli&s;h Mo&s;aic rites, and &s;ervices, and open a pa&s;&s;age for the Jew and the Gentile; for the Greek and Barbarian, who believe in him through the new and living way of obedience unto death, unto the holie&s;t of all.</P>
<P>The fourth thing which de&s;erves our attenti|on, is that "having cried with a loud voice, he yielded up the gho&s;t." The voice is among the fir&s;t things in a dying per&s;on that fails him, faltering &s;o much, that the few broken &s;entences attempted to be uttered, are &s;carcely
<PB N="88" REF="86" MS="y">
intelligible; but our Saviour, &s;peaking as a man in full vigour and &s;trength, di&s;covered that he was not yet exhau&s;ted, but could have &s;urvived for a much longer time, the tortures of the cro&s;s. Yielding up the gho&s;t while &s;o much life remained, explains what he had formerly declared to his di&s;ciples, <Q>No man taketh away my life from me; I lay it down of my&s;elf.</Q> He withdrew from the body, and died by an act of his own, according to the power which he had received of his father; he could have done &s;o, the moment he was nailed to the cro&s;s, leaving an in&s;en&s;ible corp&s;e to the in&s;ults and cruelty of his enemies, but he en|dured his &s;uffering as long as was nece&s;&s;ary, with patience and re&s;olution; then he left the body in &s;uch a manner, and with &s;o much dig|nity, as had not, in any former in&s;tance, nor can in any &s;ucceeding, be equalled. This circum&s;tance, in a particular manner, affected the centurion, who, as another evangeli&s;t expre&s;sly informs us, when <Q>he &s;aw that he &s;o cried out, and gave up the gho&s;t,</Q> glorified God by the confe&s;&s;ion in our text. The loud voice which he uttered is very &s;ignificant. It may be con&s;idered as the &s;hout of a con|queror, now &s;poiling principalities and powers, and making a &s;how of them openly on his cro&s;s, or the proclamation of a herald, point|ing out to all the world, 'the prince of life, mighty to &s;ave.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="87" MS="y">The la&s;t thing I take notice of is, that <Q>the graves were opened, and many bodies of &s;aints which &s;lept aro&s;e.</Q> It is likely that the tombs were opened by the earthquake, and whil&s;t they continued unclo&s;ed, the dead bo|dies which were depo&s;ited, recovered life and came forth, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of all tho&s;e who &s;aw, or were informed of this fact. It was an expre&s;&s;ive event, particularly &s;o at this time, di&s;covering at once the re&s;urrection of the body, and the connection which this has with the death and re&s;urrection of our Saviour from the dead. The &s;un's withholding his light at mid-day, the earth's trembling; the rocks' rending; the veil of the temple torn by an invi&s;ible hand from the top to the bottom; our Saviour's evidently yielding up his life by an act of his own; the dead's coming out of their graves, are events well &s;uited to com|mand the attention and reach the heart: which brings us to the</P>
<P N="2">II. General head, in which I propo&s;ed to &s;hew how the <Q>centurion, and tho&s;e that were with him watching Je&s;us,</Q> were effect|ed by the&s;e alarming events. It is &s;aid,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> That "they feared greatly," were thrown into a panic, le&s;t they &s;hould be lo&s;t in the darkne&s;s, or burried in the earthquake; le&s;t that God, to whom vengeance belonged, &s;hould, in &s;ome very terrible manner, avenge
<PB N="90" REF="88">
the quarrel of the Saviour, both again&s;t them, and the body of the Jewi&s;h nation in general. A guilty mind is con&s;cious of amazement and di&s;tre&s;s, even when there is no apparent dan|ger; but this becomes oppre&s;&s;ive and over|whelming, when God appears in &s;uch dreadful maje&s;ty as he now di&s;covered. The&s;e tor|menting apprehen&s;ions were not peculiar to the &s;oldiers who were on guard, but another evangeli&s;t maks it known that <HI>all the people that came together to that &s;ight, beholding the things which were done, &s;mote their brea&s;ts, and returned.</HI></P>
<P>We may ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e that the crowd which was now together, was uncommonly great, con&s;idering how much the fame of Je&s;us was &s;pread through Judea, and what va&s;t multitudes were drawn to Jeru&s;alem to celebrate the fea&s;t. That multitude, many of whom, in all likelihood, had lately joined in the tumul|tuous outcry, 'Crucify him, crucify him,' were now confounded with remor&s;e, and laid deeply to heart what had happened; to which convictions we may rea&s;onably a&s;cribe a pre|di&s;po&s;ition for the &s;ucce&s;s which afterwards attended the apo&s;tles' mini&s;trations. The terror into which they were now thrown, led them</P>
<P><HI>Second,</HI> To confe&s;s 'Truly this was the &s;on of God.' We find a like confe&s;&s;ion once, and again, made by tho&s;e, who, during our Sa|viour's

per&s;onal mini&s;try, were witne&s;ses of the miraculous power which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Its meaning, con&s;idering the per&s;ons by whom it was made, cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed always to have been preci&s;e and determined. It however, evidently includes thus much, that the per&s;on &s;poken of was a dignified per&s;on, and of un|blemi&s;hed &s;anctity; was dear unto God, and had particular intere&s;t with him; was more than is found in human nature, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed di&s;tingui&s;hed excellencies. The&s;e, or &s;ome &s;uch ideas, are expre&s;&s;ed in the confe&s;&s;ion before us.</P>
<P>The Sanhedrim condemn him for bla&s;phe|my, in a&s;&s;erting that he was the &s;on of God: the multitude a&s;&s;ent to the condemnation as ju&s;t; but the tide is turned. They believe his preten&s;ions to be well founded. Hereafter they expect to &s;ee him on the right hand of power, coming in the clouds of heaven.</P>
<P>The centurion and his &s;oldiers, the di&s;tant &s;pectator, and he who was near, Jew or Gen|tile, &s;tartled at the darkne&s;s, and the earth|quake; at the extraordinary manner in which he died, and the other prodigies which follow|ed; were nece&s;&s;itated to declare in &s;pite of meanne&s;s and contempt, of calumny and re|proach, of the &s;hame of the cro&s;s, and the ig|nominy of death, that he was "a righteous per&s;on," whom the Jews had maliciou&s;ly

accu&s;ed, whom Pilate had wrongfully con|demned, whom they, with wicked mouths and cruel hands, had in&s;ulted and put to death. Heaven and earth, the living and the dead, declare his dignity, and put it out of doubt that he 'was the &s;on of God, this confe&s;&s;ion was made in the</P>

<P>It was a captain and his company; &s;oldiers and Romans, warlike heroes and experienced veterans, who&s;e intrepidity and courage armed their hearts again&s;t fear; who&s;e familiarity with &s;cenes of cruelty and death, hardened them again&s;t pity. They lately in&s;ulted a condemned pri&s;oner, and increa&s;ed, by cruel mockings, the agony of the cro&s;s: But their hearts now relent; their con&s;ciences &s;everely &s;mite them, and they yield to a conviction which was &s;o well founded, that the per&s;on whom they had crucified was "The &s;on of God."</P>
<P>But the conviction reaches further than among the&s;e &s;oldiers: The whole multitude of &s;pectators felt its force, and di&s;covered the &s;adne&s;s of their hearts in their countenances, and by expre&s;&s;ive actions. A conviction thus general, and &s;o well founded, mu&s;t have its weight with every thinking per&s;on; and in|deed
<PB N="93" REF="91" MS="y">
it was to be expected from &s;uch events as have already been explained, and it gives pro|bability to what the Evangeli&s;ts record. It may rai&s;e a moment's doubt, that we hear no|thing of the relenting of the high prie&s;t, and of tho&s;e who were the immediate per&s;ecutors of our Saviour, but this doubt will di&s;appear when we remember that they had all along re|&s;i&s;ted the fulle&s;t conviction, and mo&s;t undoubt|ed evidence. It was therefore allowed in ju&s;t judgment, that their hearts, like the heart of Pharoah, &s;hould remain hardened and unre|lenting: But this does not weaken evidence otherwi&s;e univer&s;al and unexceptionable.</P>
<P>We have now fini&s;hed the ob&s;ervations by which we meant to illu&s;trate this pa&s;&s;age, and may learn from what has been &s;aid, how far the facts which have now been explained, and the impre&s;&s;ion which they made on &s;pectators, ought to affect us.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the &s;eal of heaven to the character of Je&s;us. They rmove the reproach of the cro&s;s; they put honour upon his per&s;on; they enhance the value of his &s;ufferings.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t we follow our Saviour to Calvary, and contemplate the &s;hame and ignominy; the pain and di&s;tre&s;s; the in&s;ult and cruelty with which he was overwhelmed; let us immedi|ately recollect the darkne&s;s which prevailed at

mid-day, the quaking of the earth, the rend|ing of the rocks, the veil of the temple torn by an invi&s;ible hand, the uncommon manner in which our Saviour died, and the dead ari&s;ing from their graves, and appearing unto many; and let the recollection of the&s;e things &s;ink into our hearts, for they te&s;tify that the Father approved of the Saviour, and excepts of his &s;ufferings as the attonement for our guilt. Let this, therefore, be the language of our faith, <Q>We believe, heavenly father, in him whom thou approve&s;t, and receive him as our Saviour!

<HEAD>DISCOURSE VII. THE SCRIPTURE, AN ANCIENT AND GE|NUINE PRODUCTION.</HEAD>

<P>Mo&s;es, of old time, hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the Synagogues every Sabbath day.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the&s;e words, the apo&s;tle James, in a council a&s;&s;embled at Jeru&s;alem, to decide on &s;ome difficulties which had ari&s;en in the church at Antioch, and were now under con|&s;ideration, a&s;&s;erts that the Old Te&s;tament was generally known, the book it&s;elf having for a long time been in circulation, and the doc|trines which it contained, &s;trenuou&s;ly incul|cated, <HI>Mo&s;es of old time, hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the Synagogue every &s;abbath day.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="94" MS="y">The antiquity of the &s;criptures is evidently taught in the&s;e words, and the great pains which had been taken to tran&s;mit them uncor|rupted through &s;ucceeding ages. The illu&s;|tration of the&s;e things is what I am at this time, through Divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to attempt.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering the &s;cripture as the olde&s;t book in the world, it demands in this view, the examination of the inqui&s;itive, exclu&s;ively of its higher demands, as a divine revelation.&mdash; The Jewi&s;h religion has been of long &s;tanding and the Jews &s;o confirmed in the belief of its divine origin, that no reproach nor &s;uffering could root out this belief from their minds. Blended with other nations, when it was for their intere&s;t to forget their own cu&s;toms and religion, they have adhered &s;trictly to both. This is the more remarkable &s;ince, except chri&s;tians, and chri&s;tianity, it has happened to no other people nor religion. The &s;upport of the &s;ecular arm withdrawn, fal&s;e religions have di&s;appeared; but Judai&s;m, and chri&s;tia|nity, where Judai&s;m is refined and perfected, have been introduced with &s;uch atte&s;tations of their proceeding from God, that neither change nor affliction have been able to &s;hake this pillar on which they re&s;t.</P>
<P>The Jews were a very ob&s;tinate, and incre|dulous people, without the &s;tronge&s;t evidence of the divine authority of their law, they
<PB N="97" REF="95" MS="y">
would never have &s;ubmitted to &s;uch a number of burden&s;ome and painful rites, which &s;e|parated them from all other people, and placed them in &s;ome in&s;tances, in a very rediculous point of light. There was a &s;ettled opinion among them, and a con&s;tant tradition, that God had &s;poken to Mo&s;es, and had done by him in Egypt, and in the wilderne&s;s, what no man, unle&s;s authori&s;ed by God, could have done. This opinion and tradition gives the greate&s;t credibility of which it is capable to the Mo&s;aic hi&s;tory. The Greeks, from whom all nations derive their learning, allow that they had their letters from foreigners, which letters are the &s;ame as the Syriac or Hebrew. The ancient Attic laws al&s;o, whence the Ro|man were afterwards taken, owe their origin to the laws of Mo&s;es. Than the&s;e circum|&s;tances which are well authenticated by Gro|tius, nothing can more convincingly e&s;tabli&s;h the great antiquity of the writings of Mo&s;es. The authorities from which Mo&s;es drew his hi&s;tory before his own time were good; and character, as a hi&s;torian, &s;ince he neither conceals his own faults, nor attempts any thing which could tend to aggrandize his fa|mily, &s;tands very high. The tradition from Adam to Mo&s;es concerning the creation, and the &s;ub&s;equent events, pa&s;&s;ed through few, and the&s;e judicious, credible per&s;ons. Methu&s;e|lah conver&s;ed a long time, both with Adam and Noah; Shem with Noah and Abraham; I&s;aac
<PB N="98" REF="96" MS="y">
with Abraham and Jo&s;eph; Abraham with Jo&s;eph and Mo&s;es. The information then from Adam to Mo&s;es pa&s;&s;ed through four per&s;ons only, who were pious and intelligent, who could not mi&s;take the account, and were every way di&s;po&s;ed to pre&s;erve it full, and un|adulterated. Be&s;ides, as &s;cience of every kind originated from Egypt, and the ea&s;tern coun|tries, and as Mo&s;es was deeply ver&s;ed in all their knowledge, in this re&s;pect, were his in|&s;piration out of view, he was well qualified for the ta&s;k which he had undertaken. A little before his death Mo&s;es wrote his law, <HI>And it came to pa&s;s, when Mo&s;es had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were fini&s;hed, then Mo&s;es commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord, &s;aying, Take this book of the law, and put it in the &s;ide of the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God, that it may be there for a witne&s;s again&s;t thee.</HI> By this law their ritual was re|gulated, and civil cau&s;es tried: It was the directory for their wor&s;hip, and the guardian of all their priviliges. It was nece&s;&s;ary that a copy of it &s;hould be in the hands of their prie&s;ts, and rulers, be&s;ides the one lodged in the ark. Their chief magi&s;trate was obliged to have one copy written with his own hand to regulate him in the execution of his high office. Under the corrupt princes the divine law was much neglected. This had been the ca&s;e previou&s;ly to Jeho&s;aphat's reign.
<PB N="99" REF="97" MS="y">
Yet the law was not lo&s;t. Numbers appoint|ed by this good king, had the book of the law of the Lord with them, and went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught the people. The wor&s;hip in Hezekiah's reign, was hereby conducted. His &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, Mana&s;&s;eh and Amon, were enemies to this law; but it was &s;ought after by Jo&s;iah, and &s;trictly obeyed. It was not lo&s;t during the captivity, for Ezra regulated the wor&s;hip of the returning Jews according to this law. It included the whole books of Mo&s;es: reca|pitulating its contents, Nehemiah takes no|tice of the Creation, of Abraham's hi&s;tory, and of the departure of the I&s;raelites from Egypt. Antiochus de&s;igned to de&s;troy the law, but the exertions of Judas Maccabaeus fru&s;trated that de&s;ign; copies of it has been multiplied. The Jews had it with them in Judea, and in their di&s;per&s;ions through every country, nor was it long after Antiochus's day, when the Greek ver&s;ion of it was procured to enrich the library of one of the Ptolemyes of Egypt.</P>
<P>The writings of Mo&s;es have been in the hands of the Jews, &s;ince the fir&s;t; many inte|re&s;ts were involved in pre&s;erving the&s;e una|dulterated; particularly as they contained their title to a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in Canaan. Men are very anxious to have titles of this kind un|doubted. All this anxiety was excited to prevent, in the books of which I &s;peak, any
<PB N="100" REF="98" MS="y">
alteration, or curruption; circumci&s;ion, in u&s;e from the earlie&s;t ages, and &s;acrifices of vari|ous kinds; the ob&s;ervance of the Sabbath and of different fe&s;tivals; the law of inheri|tances, and the criminal law, owed either their origin or e&s;tabli&s;hment to Mo&s;es. Is it po&s;&s;ible that &s;uch things could have been impo&s;ed upon a people, had they been fic|titious? Were the&s;e not &s;tanding proofs, that Mo&s;es did <HI>once</HI> live and legi&s;late? And living and legi&s;lating, mu&s;t not the evidence of his acting under divine authority have been very &s;trong, which could overcome the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate incredulity, and bend the neck of the mo&s;t inflexible to a grievous yoke? This is a weighty con&s;ideration. It is forcibly urged again&s;t the Dei&s;ts by Mr. Charles Le&s;lie, in a little, but u&s;eful treati&s;e, called his &s;hort and ea&s;y method with them. And, indeed, it is a con|&s;ideration which an attentive per&s;on cannot get over. By great peculiarities have the Jews been di&s;tingui&s;hed ever &s;ince Mo&s;es's day, both in their own land, and when &s;trangers in other countries. A reverence for Mo&s;es was tran&s;mitted from father to &s;on. Co|temporaries knew that he was commi&s;&s;ioned from God, and the impre&s;&s;ion could never be worn out, even when it reflected mo&s;t on their conduct and preten&s;ions.</P>
<P>In the writings of Homer we have a good account of Heathen theology. The&s;e wri|tings
<PB N="101" REF="99" MS="y">
are <HI>confe&s;&s;edly</HI> the work of him who&s;e name they hear, and allowed to be genuine and ancient writings. But is the authenticity of Homer any ways equal to the authenticity of Mo&s;es? Homer's writings were found by Lycurgus the Lacedemonian legi&s;lator, when he &s;ailed into A&s;ia, in detached pieces, handed down by tradition only fifty years at lea&s;t after Homer's death. The&s;e pieces were pre|&s;erved in this detached &s;tate under &s;everal titles, for the religious and political knowledge which they contained, until at la&s;t they were divided by Pi&s;i&s;tratus at Athens into two po|ems the Iliad, and the Ody&s;&s;ey. This edition was corrected under Alexander the Great, and afterwards further under one of the Ptolemyes, which la&s;t edition is now in the hands of the learned. Homer thus found, collected, and improved, is received as genuine. He would be thought a madman by whom this was que&s;tioned. Yet it has not any of the marks of authenticity which belong to the writings of Mo&s;es; he wrote the&s;e with his own hand, depo&s;ited them in the &s;anctuary, and left mo|numents of their truth, which are pre&s;erved through every age and &s;een among all nations. To refu&s;e &s;uch evidence, is to be ob&s;tinately ignorant. That the Pentateuch was written by Mo&s;es is confirmed by the highe&s;t atte&s;tation of which the thing can admit.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="100" MS="y">The authenticity of Mo&s;es's writings being e&s;tabli&s;hed, the authenticity of the re&s;t will follow. The Jews were then in pe&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of methods to determine what came from God, and what was merely human. Jo&s;hua wrote the hi&s;tory of his own times, and probably the la&s;t chapter of Deuteronomy. The P&s;alms, prophecies, and hi&s;tories of a private or public nature, were written occa&s;ionally, and being found genuine, were gradually received into the Canon. Ezra, after the captivity, began to collect them together, giving a correct edi|tion of the &s;cripture. He made great pro|gre&s;s in this work, which was compleated, &s;ome years after, probably by Malachi. The whole was divided into &s;ections, and from this period read regularly in the Synagogues, un|til our Saviour's appearance, who allowed their authenticity.</P>
<P>The hints now thrown out, mu&s;t go far in e&s;tabli&s;hing any by whom they are con&s;i|dered in the belief that the Old Te&s;tament is a genuine, and an ancient book; I proceed to &s;peak of the New.</P>
<P>It is the concurrent te&s;timony of Jews and Gentiles, of friends and enemies; that Je&s;us Chri&s;t lived in Judea, in the reign of Tiberius Cae&s;ar, and &s;uffered under Pontius Pilate. The account of his &s;ufferings and death was tran&s;mitted to the emperor by the governor
<PB N="103" REF="101" MS="y">
of Judea, and was extant when Ju&s;tin Mar|tyr wrote, who appeals to it, in his apology for chri&s;tianity, addre&s;&s;ed to the Roman &s;enate. Equally evident is it that this &s;ame Je&s;us af|ter his death, was reverenced, was wor&s;hip|ped, was obeyed by multitudes who bore his name Their hi&s;tory is interwoven with the hi&s;tory of the empire. Chri&s;tians were found in the palace, and in the army, among the polite and the rude, the ignorant, and the well informed. Edicts were repeatedly i&s;&s;ued again&s;t them, and &s;trictly executed; yet they multiplied and handed down their religion, through every &s;ucceeding generation, until the time in which we live. The doctrines which Je&s;us taught, and which chri&s;tians be|lieved are contained in the New Te&s;tament. It is not certain at what time the books of the New Te&s;tament were collected into one volume. This we know that before the mid|dle of the &s;econd century, the&s;e books were generally read in every chri&s;tian &s;ociety throughout the world, and were accounted a divine rule of faith and manners. Eu&s;ebius expre&s;sly affirms, in his Eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory, that John gave his approbation to the go&s;|pels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, which di&s;countenances the &s;en&s;ele&s;s jeer that Luke was received into the church by one vote on|ly. The go&s;pel had been in general circulati|on, and receiving the apo&s;tle John's approbati|on, he added his own as a &s;upplement to the
<PB N="104" REF="102" MS="y">
re&s;t. The other books of this volume were probably collected at the &s;ame time, and &s;ancti|oned by the &s;ame authority. Spurious pro|ductions early appeared. The&s;e are ea&s;ily de|tected. The churches to whom the epi&s;tles were written pre&s;erved them with care, and communicated them to others: any difficulty ari&s;ing, the truth was ea&s;ily traced up to the &s;ource, when either the apo&s;tles's own wri|tings, or evidence equally weighty, put the matter out of doubt: &s;ome of the epi&s;tles being que&s;tioned, after a minute inve&s;tigation, their authenticity was a&s;certained, and they were uni|ver&s;ally received into the &s;acred Canon. The early ages of chri&s;tianity had great opportu|nities of a&s;certaining whether the books of the New Te&s;tament were written by tho&s;e who bear their names, and it was the opinion of tho&s;e in the&s;e early ages, whether friends or enemies, that they were. Chri&s;tians them|&s;elves acknowledged them as &s;uch. Neither Jews nor Gentiles rai&s;ed any controver&s;y on this &s;ubject, Julian who had apo&s;tatized from chri&s;tianity, and became its embittered enemy, frankly confe&s;&s;es that Peter and Paul, Mat|thew, Mark, and Luke wrote the books read in chri&s;tian a&s;&s;emblies under their name. Dr. Whitby has many quotations in proof of this, particularly Dr. Lardner. Tho&s;e who are in|qui&s;itive after &s;uch information may con&s;ult the&s;e authors.</P>

Upon his martyrdom Origin ap|peared and advocated chri&s;tianity very &s;ucce&s;s|fully for fifty-two years. Paul, the famous her|mit, retired a little before Origin's death, from the Decian per&s;ecution, and lived until the year 343, about which period the empire embraced the chri&s;tian revelation. This is one channel through which our Saviour's hi&s;tory might be pre&s;erved unadulterated, and whence inqui&s;itive per&s;ons might acquire the fulle&s;t &s;atisfaction. Upon this, Mr. Addi&s;on lays great &s;tre&s;s. It de&s;erves an attentive regard, upon the fathers of the church, who&s;e infor|mation was &s;o good, we may, certainly for hi&s;torical facts, entirely depend. It is their unanimous voice, that the &s;criptures of the New Te&s;tament as now received, were writ|ten by the per&s;ons who bear their names, and were appealed to, as divinely in&s;pired wri|tings.</P>
<P>Some in&s;titutions al&s;o, originating from our Saviour's time, and &s;till pre&s;erved in the church; &s;uch as the ob&s;ervance of the Lord's

<P>The only remaining enquiry is, have the&s;e writings, and in&s;titutions, been handed down unadulterated? Are they no ways corrupted nor changed? Can we receive them as genu|ine, and pure?</P>
<P>Some circum&s;tances ought to have great weight in attending to the&s;e enquiries. The writings of Mo&s;es, when once received, could, in no material point be altered, &s;ince the ori|ginal copy was &s;acredly pre&s;erved in the ark, to which an appeal might always be made, &s;ince many copies were in the hands of their magi&s;trates and prie&s;ts; &s;ince it was the tenure on which they held their lands, and the di|rectory for their wor&s;hip; &s;ince the Samari|tans, the bitter enemies of the Jews, had among them copies of the&s;e writings, which they con&s;idered as &s;acred. The remembrance of a whole nation mu&s;t have been fir&s;t entirely obliterated, attachment to ancient practices removed; an indifference become univer&s;al to the&s;e titles, which &s;ecured them in their po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions, and connivance be found among in|veterate enemies, before &s;uch corruptions could take place. Such things were impo&s;&s;i|ble. The Jews in copying the &s;acred volume,
<PB N="107" REF="105" MS="y">
numbered the words and letters, as well as &s;entences. Reproving the Jews for many crimes, our Saviour never once blamed them for; corrupting the &s;acred text. They had made it void by their traditions, but the text remained in its original &s;tate, and was approv|ed of on all occa&s;ions, by our Saviour, and by his apo&s;tles. As it was not corrupted <HI>then</HI> it could not <HI>afterwards,</HI> when copies thereof were multiplied, and in all hands, whether Chri&s;ti|ans, Heathens or Jews.</P>
<P>The writings of the New Te&s;tament have been guarded with equal care. They could never originally have been admitted, had not the facts which they relate, the doctrines which they inculcate, and the precepts which they pre&s;cribe, been con&s;onant with the facts, the doctrines, and the precepts, related, incul|cated and pre&s;cribed, by tho&s;e who fir&s;t &s;pread the go&s;pel; and when admitted, without an agreement of all the world; for the &s;criptures had &s;oon a general circulation, the&s;e could not have been fal&s;ified. That Copyje&s;ts have committed blunders, that errors have crept in through the pre&s;s, is not, and cannot be denied. It could not have been otherwi&s;e, without a con&s;tant miracle. This was not nece&s;&s;ary. The&s;e writings are as correct and pure, as any of equal &s;tanding, nay, much more &s;o; mankind having every thing at &s;take, in the&s;e writings, have tran&s;mitted them from father

to &s;on, with the utmo&s;t care. It would be accounted a petulance, very unworthy of an hone&s;t enquirer, to reject as &s;purious, the Ilead or the Aeneid, becau&s;e &s;ome errors have crept into the copies which are in our hands; the petulance is the more inexcu&s;able, when the &s;criptures are in que&s;tion, which are more ex|empt from &s;uch errors than the&s;e other wri|tings, and come down to us with marks of the highe&s;t authenticity.</P>
<P>Had not the &s;ubject been of &s;uch impor|tance, I &s;hould not have treated of it at &s;uch length, and indeed it might be illu&s;trated in other ways, con&s;idering the u&s;e of rea&s;on in religion, and &s;hewing how much a good life prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a man in favour of the go&s;pel, whil&s;t a bad life inclines him to di&s;believe it; but enough has been &s;aid to direct the &s;erious enquirer, and we might &s;peak for ever before others will be per&s;uaded to open their eyes to the light which falls from every quarter on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I therefore di&s;mi&s;s the &s;ubject at pre&s;ent, te&s;tifying, from the fulle&s;t conviction, that the&s;e writings are indeed, the word of God, that they are the only &s;afe guide through the darkne&s;s experienced in this world, that by them, afterwards we &s;hall a&s;&s;uredly be judged, and according to their deci&s;ion, &s;hall either &s;tand or fall.</P>

many eminent qualities. In infancy the&s;e lie dormant; there is no trace of rea&s;on. The future philo&s;opher, or the future idiot is not at this pe|riod to be known. They are &s;uperior in no|thing, to the lower orders of creation. In &s;ome re&s;pects they are their inferiors. The perfect u&s;e of any &s;en&s;e, or of any member is acquired in a very gradual manner. The im|provement of the mind, is &s;till more gradual. It is a long time before we attain any u&s;eful knowledge. Some, even after a long life, know very little. The mo&s;t knowing, find that they know in part only. The pre&s;ent &s;tate, in reference to the future, ri&s;es little, even when eminently improved, above the &s;tate of infancy in reference to manhood. This has readily been confe&s;&s;ed by all who have given the matter any degree of attention, whether they have enjoyed the direction of a divine revelation, or have been directed by natural religion only. Paul's &s;entiments on this &s;ubject are well known. Speaking of endowments which rendered the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or in his day, celebrated and u&s;eful, he &s;peaks of them as adapted to an infant &s;tate only, and ready &s;oon to be laid a&s;ide, and forgotten. <HI>Whether,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>there be prophecies, they &s;hall fail, whether there be tongues, they &s;hall cea&s;e; whether there be knowledge, it &s;hall vani&s;h away.

When I was a child, I &s;pake as a child, I under|&s;tood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childi&s;h things.

<P>Mankind thus helple&s;s and ignorant in the infant &s;tate, and acquiring, even when mo&s;t improved by religious and philo&s;ophical know|ledge, comparatively very incon&s;iderable at|tainments, are too head-&s;trong. It is but little they know, nor are they anxious after know|ledge. Much time and pains have been thrown away on numbers. The darkne&s;s of their minds has been too gro&s;s to penetrate; and their di&s;po&s;itions too obdurate to receive any poli&s;h. When families or tribes, have long &s;eparated from the re&s;t of mankind, they have generally &s;unk into a &s;avage &s;tate, in which the man has been degraded into the animal, and the highly boa&s;ted gift of rea&s;on been hardly di&s;cernable. A general intercour&s;e
<PB N="112" REF="110" MS="y">
with different nations pre&s;erves appearances. But even this is not &s;ufficient. The united effort of the rea&s;on of nations celebrated as polite, has left men under the influence of the mo&s;t ab&s;urd opinions and corrupt practices.</P>
<P>Bewildered as mankind are in their opinions, and degenerated in their practices, their pre|ten&s;ions are high and arrogant. "Vain man would be wi&s;e"&mdash;he ventures upon the mo&s;t ab&s;tru&s;e &s;ubjects&mdash;no guide is &s;uppo&s;ed nece&s;|&s;ary&mdash;he can guide his own &s;teps&mdash;providence has put the matter to an i&s;&s;ue. The Gentile world had originally a &s;imple and di&s;tinct tra|dition, concerning the creation of the world, and the object of wor&s;hip; what they &s;aw of God's works; what they experienced of his providence, confirming that tradition ought to have rendered them devout, thankful, and obedient. Such the tendency of their advan|tages. And nothing prevented their operating thus, but man's vanity. He would not keep to the &s;imple truth, but mu&s;t blend it with his own inventions. One invention was intro|duced after another, until the truth was &s;o en|tirely di&s;gui&s;ed that it could not be known. <HI>Syphis,</HI> a <HI>king</HI> of Egypt, near Abraham's time, fir&s;t ventured on &s;uch bold practices <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>philo&s;ophers,</HI> in after ages, trod too exactly in his foot-&s;teps, forming a mon&s;trous fabrick, of which we have a &s;ad picture in the Epi&s;tle to the Romans. The apo&s;tle &s;peaks of the

Heathen world. <HI>Profe&s;&s;ing them&s;elves to be wi&s;e, they became fools; And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed bea&s;ts, and creeping things. And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do tho&s;e things which are not convenient: Being filled with all unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, fornication, wickedne&s;s, covetou&s;ne&s;s, maliciou&s;ne&s;s: full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity, whi&s;perers, backbiters, haters of God, de&s;piteful, proud, boa&s;ters, inven|ters of evil things, di&s;obedient to parents, without under&s;tanding, covenant-breakers, without natural aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ction, implacable, unmerciful: Who knowing the judgment of God, (that they which commit &s;uch things are worthy of death,) not only do the &s;ame, but have plea&s;ure in them that do them.</HI></P>
<P>Whether mankind's advantages have been greater or le&s;s, the improvement of them through a vain imagination, has been neglect|ed. The apo&s;tle Paul, beheld the working of this di&s;po&s;ition in his own day. Folly was dignified with high &s;ounding titles; &s;till it was folly. Revelation no where di&s;courages u&s;eful knowledge, whatever is for the conveni|ence and happine&s;s of man, either in this world or in the next, has its countenance, and approbation. But &s;peculations which inflame men's pride, and corrupt their conduct are uni|formly

di&s;countenanced as unfit for them, and of pernicious con&s;equence. "Beware," &s;ays the apo&s;tle, <Q>le&s;t any man &s;poil you through philo&s;ophy, and vain deceit.</Q> Again, <Q>Avoid profane, and vain babblings, and oppo|&s;itions of <HI>&s;cience, fal&s;ely</HI> &s;o called.</Q> And again, <Q>Neither give heed to fables, and end|le&s;s genealogies, which mini&s;ter que&s;tions, rather than Godly edifying.</Q> In &s;uch ad|monitions the &s;criptures by no means di&s;cou|rage any u&s;eful knowledge, more than phy&s;i|cians do, who guard again&s;t dangerous pre|tenders to their art. A philo&s;ophy which di&s;gui&s;es the truth, and depraves the practice, but which has always been in too much re|pute, is certainly pernicious, incurring ju&s;tly, that cen&s;ure thrown upon it in the &s;cripture.</P>
<P>Having &s;tated the&s;e few facts which give a mortifying view of human nature; it will be nece&s;&s;ary to find out, if po&s;&s;ible, what is meant by "rea&s;on," which is &s;o much &s;poken of, and oppo&s;ed, by numbers, very improperly, to revelation. Rea&s;on is that intellectual princi|ple which rai&s;es us above mere animal nature. It capacitates us for receiving valuable know|ledge. It is our di&s;tingui&s;hing charactere&s;tic. It advances us in the &s;cale of being. We do not depreciate this principle, for it is our glory. Let its operations be natural, without any force or improper bia&s;s, and it will operate for our advantage.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="113">I have con&s;idered rea&s;on as that capacity of the &s;oul, whereby we receive knowledge. It has its particular &s;phere. The &s;un diffu&s;es its heat and light to a certain length in &s;pace. At a certain point its influence cea&s;es. The eye takes in a limited view: Beyond this vi&s;i|on cannot reach The vibrations which pro|duce &s;ound, affect the air to a preci&s;e extent.

It belongs to the di|vine mind only to be infinite in its capacities, and perfection.</P>
<P>This is &s;o evident, that I need not attempt any illu&s;tration. The &s;ub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ect had not at all been introduced, were there not generally a very improper way of expre&s;&s;ing our&s;elves, man conceiving &s;o extravagantly of rea&s;on, as to place it on the throne of God, and to wor|&s;hip this deity of their own creation. It was a humour of the &s;ame kind in our fir&s;t parents, who expected to deify them&s;elves by di&s;obedi|ence. Let me here propo&s;e a few plain en|quiries. There is no doubt but men have been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of rea&s;on from the fir&s;t. Were ancient legi&s;lators, and philo&s;ophers in|debted for their knowledge, whereby they be|came

very u&s;eful and celebrated, to their own rea&s;oning? By no means. They travelled from one country to another, collecting care|fully, &s;uch tradition as had e&s;caped the hand of time, and trea&s;uring the&s;e in their minds, formed from that &s;ource, their &s;y&s;tems of le|gi&s;lation, and of wi&s;dom. What kind of re|ligion originated from the &s;peculations of men, who laying a&s;ide tradition, and every fo|reign a&s;&s;i&s;tance, depended wholly upon them|&s;elves? It was the mo&s;t mon&s;trous which can be imagined; the creature was mi&s;taken for the Creator; a four footed bea&s;t for the object of wor&s;hip; a creeping in&s;ect for the eternal mind. Has this principle an energy in our day which it had not in former days? I am not &s;en&s;ible that it has. Dignified with a proud title, it is not more "The Age of Rea|&s;on" than other ages. "The Age of Revo|lutions," would have been a more characteri&s;ti|cal title. Is the book which compliments &s;o highly the age in which we live, a &s;pecimen of enlightened rea&s;on? It is &s;uch a &s;pecimen as effrontery, and ignorance of the &s;ubject can give. Whether this ignorance be pretended, or real, I &s;hall not determine, but it is gro&s;s and lamentable. Having &s;poken of the Old Te&s;tament, the author introduces a new &s;ub|ject. "So much," &s;ays he, "for <HI>the Bible.</HI>" I now proceed to the New Te&s;tament. A&s;to|ni&s;hing! Does he not know even the title of the book with which he contends. "The
<PB N="117" REF="115" MS="y">
Bible" is the general name, including both the Old and the New Te&s;tament, and puts a mark of di&s;tinction on the&s;e writings. The au|thor quibbles at the titles <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>New</HI> Te&s;ta|ment; <HI>greater</HI> and <HI>le&s;&s;er</HI> prophets. This quib|ble ari&s;es from want of information. The&s;e title are not in the text, but mark out certain books: doing this, they an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of names, and no more; but the writings them|&s;elves are no more accountable for the&s;e names, than the writings of Homer for the names Odi&s;&s;ey, and Iliad, given them long after the author's death. The nineteenth p&s;alm is celebrated as an original piece of dei&s;tical com|po&s;ition, although that p&s;alm be written expre&s;s|ly to &s;hew the excellency of revelation. The author ridicules the &s;y&s;tem of revelation by placing, perhaps, in a proper light, the inventi|ons of men, who enjoy this revelation. This is neither candid nor ju&s;t. We have nothing to do with the &s;y&s;tems of men. Let us con|fine our&s;elves to our bibles. Doing this, a great part of his ridicule is lo&s;t. I would call no man ma&s;ter on earth; not even Calvin him&s;elf. To the law and to the prophets, I appeal. Had this been done, the book dig|nified with a proud title, had never appeared. It is contended that our Saviour did not mean to die, for his enemies could not have di&s;covered the lurking places, to which he had retired, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a treacherous di&s;ciple. This is intolerable. Is it not known that our

Saviour on every day of that week, on which he &s;uffered, entered publickly the city of Jeru|&s;alem, with his di&s;ciples; walked through the &s;treets, not in di&s;gui&s;e, but attended with the &s;houts of multitudes, repaired to the temple, and taught with intrepidity, and freedom from morn|ing to night? The book it&s;elf, which this pre&s;umptuous writer has &s;ent forth, affords the be&s;t analogy for &s;uch ignorance, of which the nature of the thing can admit; declaring, that the author had for &s;ome time declined having a bible in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and could not, where he was, procure a copy Is it rea&s;onable to condemn, <HI>unheard?</HI> To decide, <HI>without exa|mining?</HI> To take things for <HI>granted,</HI> which are ab&s;olutely <HI>fal&s;e,</HI> and to found on them a &s;y&s;tem derogatory to the honour of our holy religion? If this be rea&s;on, I renounce it as unworthy of notice. Let the author I &s;peak of, be its &s;ole po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, it can neither do him nor any body el&s;e, any material benefit.</P>
<P>Whatever revolutions have lately taken place, proceed not, I apprehend, merely from the principle of "rea&s;on." If they did, we &s;hould &s;ee an uniform &s;y&s;tem, wi&s;ely contrived, &s;teadily pro&s;ecuted, and beautifully completed. Nothing of all this appears. The&s;e events have ari&s;en from the impul&s;e of the moment. The fir&s;t cau&s;es of the&s;e, had not in view what afterwards took place, and the i&s;&s;ue may be va&s;tly different from what the pre&s;ent agents in

<P>It appears from the&s;e ob&s;ervations, that <HI>rea&s;on</HI> has not that ab&s;olute controul over ei|ther religious, or civil matters, which &s;ome men would a&s;&s;ert. Secret &s;prings, generally unob&s;erved, produce effects which a&s;toni&s;h the world. Although mankind be agents in what is going on, and nearly concerned, neither is the plan theirs, nor the completion of that plan. It is arrogant to a&s;&s;ume to human ef|fort, <HI>that</HI> in which they are merely in&s;tru|ments, and however brilliant, and even u&s;eful, would &s;oon come to nought, were it not part of the divine plan, in governing the world.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t recur them to our fir&s;t ob&s;ervati|on, that rea&s;on is that principle, which capa|citates mankind for receiving knowledge.

It is gratifying
<PB N="120" REF="118" MS="y">
to the pride of mankind, to form &s;plendid &s;y&s;|tems out of their vain &s;peculations. Thus they thicken the darkne&s;s which already over-clouds their minds. They ought to acquaint them&s;elves with &s;imple facts, and let the&s;e lead them to the truth. I have in the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent examination, mentioned a number of topics, whence a divine revelation may be ar|gued. It is the bu&s;ine&s;s of rea&s;on to &s;ift the matter thoroughly, and to &s;ee how far a divine revelation may be argued from the&s;e topics. Convinced that the claim is not vain, but that there are writings which proceed from God, then, rea&s;on will &s;ugge&s;t the nece&s;&s;ity and wi&s;dom of yielding our&s;elves up to the directi|on which the&s;e afford, without a murmuring thought, or contentious word. The writings, who&s;e divine authority I have attempted to vindicate, are introduced with a few plain facts, from the&s;e a &s;y&s;tem of religious and mo|ral duties is deduced. The&s;e facts are fir&s;t principles. Let their nature be well a&s;cer|tained. They open the way for further di&s;|coveries.

we reject every thing which exceeds our un|der&s;tanding, we mu&s;t reject the exi&s;tence of God, for we cannot conceive how any being could have exi&s;ted from eternity, without any cau&s;e of its exi&s;tence; we mu&s;t reject the whole &s;y&s;tem of the univer&s;e, for we have no idea of the manner in which &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem was pro|duced, was organized, or is pre&s;erved in its pre&s;ent &s;tate, the union of &s;oul, of body, can|not be admitted, for we can neither apprehend the nature thereof, nor give an account of it.

<P>My text di&s;covers the great cau&s;e why men reject the &s;cripture. "They would be wi&s;e, although they be born as the wild a&s;&s;es's colt."

This op|po&s;ition is here a&s;cribed to their lives. Wick|ed them&s;elves, they could not endure the holi|ne&s;s required in the doctrine, and exemplified in the character of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.

<P>Di&s;cour&s;ing from the&s;e words, I &s;hall endea|vour, through divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to illu&s;trate the import of doing the will of God, and to di&s;|cover how far &s;uch conduct di&s;po&s;eth us for receiving the doctrine of Chri&s;t, as divine.</P>
<P>The way of holine&s;s is &s;o plain, that the wayfaring man, though a fool, cannot err therein. Few are the rules of conduct, and ea&s;y; level to every capacity; intelligible by every under&s;tanding; he may run that readeth them. To one principle, to one word may the whole be reduced&mdash;<HI>"Love."</HI> He that <HI>loveth</HI> hath fulfilled the law. It is equally effectual whether God or Chri&s;t, our&s;elves or others be in que&s;tion. Per&s;ons of the be&s;t capacity, and of the greate&s;t refinement, know well, that there is not a more difficult thing than to arre&s;t the operations of their own minds, and to determine accurately concern|ing them. Should I enquire of any now hear|ing me, Do you love God? or Chri&s;t? your|&s;elves, or others? You would probably he&s;i|tate; the an&s;wer is connected with a number of conclu&s;ions which ought previou&s;ly to be drawn. Let me &s;implify the que&s;tion, and enquire. Have you any rea&s;on for the exerci&s;e of this affection? And is your conduct corre&s;|pondent?
<PB N="126" REF="124">
Your reply brings us directly to the point. You know there is rea&s;on for the exerci&s;e of this affection. By the mind, you rank higher than the bea&s;ts of the field, or the fowls of heaven; you are thus a-kin to angels. This is the choice&s;t gift of God; it has been &s;tamped with his own image. The body is adapted to our circum&s;tances on earth, and furni&s;hed with &s;uch members, &s;uch &s;en&s;es, &s;uch capacities, as promote our convenience, and comfort. The peace of the mind, the welfare of the body, are the care of God. Both are con&s;idered in the con&s;titution of this lower world; and there is a better world where the ills incident to this are fully remedied. When the&s;e circum&s;tances are known, can any thing be imagined more natural than wor&s;hip and &s;ervice? Let men only be per|&s;uaded of their relation to God, and of the obligations under which, as individuals, as fa|milies, as larger &s;ocieties, he has laid them; and that the&s;e obligations are multiplied every day, every hour, every in&s;tant, they mu&s;t im|mediately perceive, that prayer and prai&s;e, reverence and obedience, love and confidence, in the clo&s;et, in the family, in the church, in the more private or public walks of life, are equal|ly rational, plea&s;ant, and indi&s;pen&s;ible. Were not men very incon&s;iderate, they would ne|ver forget God. Precepts for the perform|ance of &s;uch duties as I have been &s;tating, would hardly be requi&s;ite. To the&s;e you would naturally be impelled. If you be hun|gry,
<PB N="127" REF="125" MS="y">
need you be commanded to eat, or thir&s;ty, to drink? If languid and weary, is it nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;s you, by per&s;ua&s;ions, and entreaties, by promi&s;es, and threatnings, to receive cor|dials, or to take re&s;t? No. In &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances, &s;uch conduct is as nece&s;&s;ary and natural, as it is to breathe; equally &s;o, are all the duties of religion to the per&s;on who con|&s;iders his obligations to God, both for exi&s;t|ence, and for whatever renders exi&s;tence a ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>Our relation to God, and the obligations under which he has laid us, are ea&s;ily under|&s;tood. They do not exceed the reach of the meane&s;t capacity. Are we equally related, equally obligated to Je&s;us Chri&s;t? An an|&s;wer to this cannot be given, without recol|lecting an aera in the hi&s;tory of mankind, morti|fying in the highe&s;t degree, and pernicious. We <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re to&s;&s;ed about by furious pa&s;&s;ions, be|trayed by violent appetites; we are &s;ubjected to vanity. From the mind, and from the body; from our&s;elves, and from others; from the &s;tate of things here, from what are appre|hended &s;hall be the &s;tate of things hereafter, originate, trouble&s;ome, con&s;tant, and various evils. It was not &s;o from the fir&s;t. Man was made upright; he was placed in the mid&s;t of delights. All within, all without, what he then enjoyed, what he knew he &s;hould afterwards enjoy, con&s;pired to complete his happine&s;s. Being in honour,
<PB N="128" REF="126" MS="y">
he abode not. He rebelled again&s;t the Crea|tor; with a daring ra&s;hne&s;s he touched, he ta&s;ted the fruit which, on the &s;evere&s;t penalties, was prohibited. Since that moment, man &s;ides with fallen angels. Painful is the repre|&s;entation given of human nature by the apo&s;|tle, but it is drawn from real life. He repre|&s;ents it to be "<HI>earthly, &s;en&s;ual,</HI> and <HI>devili&s;h.</HI>" The mi&s;ery in which we were &s;unk, the ruin in which we were overwhelmed, excited the pity of Je&s;us; he undertook our deliverance. I think I hear him addre&s;s his father, <Q>Let the condemnatory &s;entence, which they have incurred, fall upon me; let thy &s;word awake again&s;t thy fellow; let it &s;mite the &s;hepherd; let my life be taken for their life, my blood for their blood; accept of my interce&s;&s;ions in their behalf; let them be renewed, let them be &s;anc|tified, let them be ju&s;tified through the merit of my death, and the operations of my &s;pirit, and be thou glorified in me, and I in them.</Q> The Father accepted of the Son's interpo&s;iti|on. He inve&s;ted him with the mediatorial office. Through his death, through his in|terce&s;&s;ion, through his prevailing influence, men are re&s;cued from ruin; are received into favour, are prepared for heaven. Let a man once be &s;en&s;ible of his guilty, mi&s;erable &s;itua|tion. Let him behold the Saviour's interpo|&s;ition, as warding off eternal de&s;truction, and re&s;toring the privileges which he had forfeited, he mu&s;t, with the utmo&s;t ardour, recognize his
<PB N="129" REF="127" MS="y">
deliverer, and entru&s;t with him his recovery. Believing in Chri&s;t, is particularly &s;poken of as the work, by which God is more immedi|ately honoured. The &s;tupidity, and ingrati|tude of hearing with indifference, of &s;uch a &s;alvation, and &s;uch a Saviour, excites the apo&s;tles's indignation, who pronounces the doom, which a moment's reflection mu&s;t di&s;|cover to be unavoidable. <Q>If any man love not the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, let him be Anathema Maunatha.</Q> Let him remain under the cur&s;e, and in his own per&s;on, feel what his di&s;obe|dience incurs.</P>
<P>The love of God, and of Chri&s;t, in&s;tantly &s;ugge&s;ts the obligation under which we are laid to both, and the duties by which this ob|ligation is be&s;t fulfilled. Self love is a prin|ciple di&s;tinct from either of the two I have mentioned. It has a preci&s;e object. The peace and welfare of the body and of the mind, are intended; of the&s;e &s;elf love is the guardi|an; it is aware of danger, and avoids it; it examines in what cour&s;e &s;afety may be expected, and determines to <HI>that</HI> cour&s;e rather than any other. The vindictive, and intem|perate act again&s;t its dictates. Both do vio|lence to them&s;elves; both feel that they are wretched. Than the principle I &s;peak of, there is not a &s;tronger in human nature. You have felt its influence. It has rendered you ac|tive, vigorous, and per&s;evering. Placing in the
<PB N="130" REF="128" MS="y">
mind it&s;elf, &s;uch a guardian of our welfare, is an in&s;tance of the goodne&s;s of God. Sur|pri&s;ing is it to me, that &s;ome &s;hould reduce all the principles of action to this one. The love of God, the love of Chri&s;t, the love of others, are all di&s;tinct principles from the love of our&s;elves. They are by no means di&s;cord|dant. The one &s;ecures our duty to God, the other our duty to Chri&s;t, the third, our duty to our&s;elves, the fourth, our duty one to ano|ther. Deficient in any of the&s;e principles, there is a defect in the character. When each is in exerci&s;e, the glory of God, and the hap|pine&s;s of our own nature, are fully e&s;tabli&s;hed. The &s;elfi&s;h &s;eem to be the lea&s;t honourable of all the principles of human action. Their operations, not interfering with the operations of higher principles, cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed di&s;|plea&s;ing to God; nay, he takes plea&s;ure in our happine&s;s, and in every thing whereby it is promoted. Prudent &s;teps for this purpo&s;e, cannot be neglected without tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing his po&s;itive command.</P>
<P>Our relation to our fellow men, may ea&s;ily be under&s;tood. We &s;pring from the &s;ame parent, and travel the &s;ame road; we are nece&s;&s;ary to each other. All orders are u&s;eful in their place. The rich or poor, the &s;trong or weak, the man of eminent or moderate abilities, may advance the common welfare. Let us once be e&s;tabli&s;hed in this truth, and we will be in|clined
<PB N="131" REF="129" MS="y">
not only to re&s;pect even the meane&s;t of our brethren, but al&s;o be rou&s;ed to perform our part, in directing, relieving, and &s;atisfying all with whom we have any connection. If we look into the &s;cripture, we find that the friend|ly regard which mankind ought to &s;hew to each other, and the friendly conduct in which they ought to abound, are enjoined by the au|thority of God, and obedience &s;ecured by pro&s;pects the mo&s;t plea&s;ant, or terrifying, as the injunction is ob&s;erved, or neglected. The will of God cannot be performed, whil&s;t any of the relative duties are overlooked; an exact attention to them is agreeable to God, and in the &s;atisfaction it gives, carries its own re|ward.</P>
<P>Having now illu&s;trated the import of doing the will of God, in as far as our duty to God, and Chri&s;t, our&s;elves and others, are in que&s;|tion, let us next endeavour to di&s;cover how &s;uch conduct di&s;po&s;es us to receive the doctrine of Chri&s;t, as divine.</P>
<P>Under one or the other of the following part|culars, may the leading doctrines of Chri&s;t be arranged.

<PB N="132" REF="130" MS="y">
doctrines I have mentioned, will appear very evident; he will no more be able to doubt of them than he can doubt of what he &s;ees, hears, and feels.</P>
<P>The depravity of human nature is &s;trongly a&s;&s;erted; its origin is traced; its progre&s;s marked. This truth is interwoven with all the in&s;titutions of the Old Te&s;tament, and the doctrines of the New. On this truth, revelati|on re&s;ts. Shake this, you &s;hake the chief pillar, and bring the whole &s;uper&s;tructure to the ground. The character which Chri&s;t &s;u&s;tains as the prophet, prie&s;t, and king of his church, &s;uppo&s;e that we are &s;adly de|praved: if we be not depraved, what the &s;cripture &s;ays of the new birth, is ab&s;olutely unintelligible. Of this as a fundamental doc|trine, you ought to be fully per&s;uaded. Know the plagues of your own hearts; &s;ee if they be not deceitful, and de&s;perately wicked. But how are you mo&s;t likely to gain &s;atisfac|tion on this particular; attempt doing the will of God, in the extent I have &s;hewn to be ne|ce&s;&s;ary. The att<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mpt will unfold the lament|able truth. God, you will find, has the be&s;t claim upon your affection; Chri&s;t upon your tru&s;t. It is matter of expediency and intere&s;t, as well as duty, that the body be kept under, and the welfare of others be promoted&punc; convinced of this, and determined to act upon the conviction, you will find it no ea&s;y matter
<PB N="133" REF="131" MS="y">
to put your determination in practice. Run|ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g well, hindrances occur. All that is commanded you are re&s;olved to do; but <HI>here</HI> you fail, <HI>there</HI> you tran&s;gre&s;s; after the greate&s;t progre&s;s in religion, there is rea&s;on to blu&s;h, and to be confounded. How is this to be accounted for otherwi&s;e than by that innate depravity &s;poken of in &s;cripture? We are not what God originally made us; greatly are we corrupted; the ca&s;e is not &s;ingular. What we experience is the experience of all who know them&s;elves. It a&s;toni&s;hes the con&s;ide|rate to hear others &s;peaking the very language of their own hearts. The experience co-incides, face an&s;wers not more exactly to face in a gla&s;s. Than this, a &s;tronger internal proof of the truth of chri&s;tianity, cannot be received. Let a man know the plagues of his own heart; let him be &s;en&s;ible of his perver&s;|ne&s;s; then let the &s;criptures introduce the chri&s;tian &s;ighing, groaning, &s;truggling; "<HI>I am carnal, &s;old under &s;in. For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I. If then I do that which I would not, I con&s;ent unto the law that it is good. Now then, it is no more I that do it, but &s;in that dwelleth in me. For I know that in me (that is, in my fle&s;h) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is pre&s;ent with me, but how to perform that which is good I find not. For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not that I do. Now, if I do that I would not, it is no
<PB N="134" REF="132">
more I that do it, but &s;in that dwelleth in me. I find then a law, that when I would do good, evil is pre&s;ent with me. For I delight in the law of God after the inward man. But I &s;ee another law in my members waring again&s;t the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of &s;in which is in my members. O wretched man that I am! who &s;hall deliver me from the body of this death?</HI> Can any hear this language with|out &s;urpri&s;e? Is it not the very language of your own hearts? Is it not a proof that the book where &s;uch language is found, proceeds from him who is well acquainted with the hearts and lives of the &s;ons of men?</P>
<P>The efficacy of the go&s;pel, meeting, op|po&s;ing, overcoming the depravity of our nature, is a doctrine of great importance. It is plainly taught; it has fully been experi|enced. This efficacy the go&s;pel exerts in three ways. It convinces us of our ruined, and peri&s;hing circum&s;tancs; it &s;hews us the extent of our danger. Providing for our &s;afety, it &s;trengthens us to improve this provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>In the conviction I &s;peak of, there is a &s;ecret, though a powerful impul&s;e; new views open; were a blind man on the brink of a precipice to receive his &s;ight, he could not be more alarmed. The mind &s;eems to exert her own powers; the deductions are all natural, ea&s;y, and plain. It is &s;urpri&s;ing that our ruined cir|cum&s;tances,
<PB N="135" REF="133">
&s;hould for the fir&s;t time, &s;trike us &s;o &s;en&s;ibly. Explicable is this on the doctrine only of &s;cripture. The divine &s;pirit is operat|ing in this natural manner, convincing us of &s;in, di&s;&s;olving the heart of &s;tone, and laying us in the du&s;t. At this moment all nature &s;eems to avenge the Creator's quarrel again&s;t the guilty. The di&s;obedient Adam is no more regaled with the verdure of Paradi&s;e. Thorns and thi&s;tles are the &s;pontaneous growth; they are extirpated with labour. Water de&s;troys a p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ofane world; fire con&s;umed the profligate Sodomites. The earth &s;wallowed up the re|bellious Cora, Dathan, Abiram, and their companions; with pe&s;tilence and the &s;word; the idolatrous and perver&s;e Jews are cut off. Particularly in the life and death of the Son of God, is it not very evident that the guilty cannot e&s;cape; but there is an atonement for guilt; there is a regenerating influence to create a new the &s;oul. In the name of the Lord Je&s;us, and by the &s;pirit of our God, may the mo&s;t irreligious, and immoral be wa&s;hed, be &s;anctified and ju&s;tified. But how may we expect to experience this efficacy of the go&s;|pel? By doing the will of God, as my text directs. Attempt this, per&s;i&s;t in the attempt; God requires &s;uch an expre&s;&s;ion of your faith and obedience. The views I &s;peak of &s;hall open upon you; the energy I &s;peak of &s;hall be felt; the grace of the go&s;pel &s;hall refre&s;h your &s;ouls. The women of Samaria, I acknow|ledge

when living in di&s;&s;ipation, Saul of Tar|&s;us, when per&s;ecuting the church, the jailor as Philippi, when oppre&s;&s;ing the &s;aints, &s;uddenly interrupted in their dangerous cour&s;es, became acquainted with the power and grace of the go&s;pel, and are &s;tanding monuments of the di|vine mercy. But this is unu&s;ual, and it would be pre&s;umptuous to depend upon a &s;imilar in|terpo&s;ition. In the road of duty, God u&s;ually meets with men. Inquire after this road, enter upon it, per&s;evere therein; you &s;hall not &s;eek God in vain, you &s;hall never find him a wilderne&s;s, nor a land of darkne&s;s. What a confirmation mu&s;t this be to the go&s;pel, when you not only hear of its efficacy, but al&s;o have experience thereof, when it has became the wi&s;dom of God, and the power of God for your own &s;alvation. Your own experience will &s;weetly accord with the experience of the apo&s;tle. <HI>There is, therefore, now no condemna|tion to them which are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who walk not after the fle&s;h, but after the &s;pirit. For the law of the &s;pirit of life in Chri&s;t Je&s;us hath made me free from the law of &s;in and death. For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the fle&s;h, God &s;ending his own Son in the likene&s;s of &s;inful fle&s;h, and for &s;in condemned &s;in in the fle&s;h: That the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the fle&s;h, but after the &s;pirit.</HI></P>
<P>The go&s;pel is particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed for bringing life and immortallity to light. This

is its peculiar honour. Were infidels to dic|tate in what manner this doctrine &s;hould be taught, they would probably fix upon the very method which the go&s;pel has taken. A glori|ous per&s;onage was plea&s;ed to de&s;cend from the world of &s;pirits; <HI>he</HI> was vi&s;ible on earth; <HI>he</HI> appeared in human nature; <HI>he</HI> was mortifi|ed to this world; <HI>he</HI> kept the other world al|ways in view, certain of future re&s;t and glory; <HI>he</HI> laboured, <HI>he</HI> agonized, <HI>he</HI> died. In the &s;eparate &s;tate <HI>he</HI> became vi&s;ible to his de&s;ciples; <HI>he</HI> conver&s;ed frequently, and in the mo&s;t familiar manner with them; <HI>five hundred</HI> at once were favoured with his pre&s;ence and conver&s;ation. In the view of numbers, after having given them the mo&s;t abundant proof of his being alive, <HI>he</HI> a&s;cended up to heaven, to receive the reigns of univer&s;al government. His followers were &s;o impre&s;&s;ed with what they knew and felt, that nothing could prevent them from &s;erving their divine redeemer, con|fident of being happy in his pre&s;ence, and ble&s;|&s;ed, through eternity. I cannot give you more certain directions for attaining to the &s;ame conviction which animated the di&s;ciples, than the direction in my text, "Do the will of God." Thus the film will fall from your eyes. Conver&s;ing with the father of your &s;pirits, you will become con&s;cious of his exi&s;tence. Your &s;oul's enlarging, and di&s;covering a noble ambi|tion, which no created thing can &s;atisfy, you will find that immortality co-incides with

your own feelings, as well as with the a&s;&s;ur|ances, and proofs which chri&s;tianity affords. Of nothing, &s;hall you be more certain. The apo&s;tle Paul &s;peaks with great confidence. He expre&s;&s;es the feelings of all chri&s;tians. <HI>If in this life only we have hope in Chri&s;t, we are of all men mo&s;t mi&s;erable. But now is Chri&s;t ri&s;en from the dead, and become the fir&s;t fruits of them that &s;lept.

<P>Infidelity is very prevalent among&s;t us. This can ea&s;ily be accounted for on the princi|ples I have been attempting to e&s;tabli&s;h. Ini|quity greatly abounds; unwilling to for&s;ake their evil ways, and dreading the denunciati|ons of the go&s;pel, le&s;t there be more truth in them than they could wi&s;h, for the ea&s;e of their own minds, men cavil at this character in &s;cripture, and at that in&s;titution: this expre&s;&s;ion

gives them offence, and that doctrine: one freedom is u&s;ed with &s;acred things after ano|ther, until they &s;uppo&s;e that they have per|&s;uaded them&s;elves, and attempt to per&s;uade others, that all is a cheat, a cunningly devi&s;ed fable. The fact is, the&s;e cavils are founded either in ignorance, or mi&s;repre&s;entation. When examined, they are un&s;ub&s;tantial; they evaporate like &s;moke in the air. Surly dogs &s;ome times bark at the luminaries of heaven, and they may bark for ever, for their barking can neither tarni&s;h the&s;e luminaries, nor effect their exi&s;tence. Your attempts, O infidel, are equally ineffectual. Chri&s;tianity is found|ed on a rock; nay, the rock of ages. If any be hearing me who incline to infidelity; were <HI>the author</HI> of the "Age of Rea&s;on" him&s;elf pre&s;ent, who not very mode&s;tly indeed, nor very delicately, has ventured, publickly, to ca&s;t abroad his poi&s;onous arrows, for the de|&s;truction, if po&s;&s;ible, of the&s;e principles, which have been the con&s;olation of thou&s;ands of thou&s;ands, and ten thou&s;and times ten thou|&s;ands. I would &s;peak a word to this author; I &s;hall not upbraid you with the hard names you give the martyrs who have obtained gene|ral re&s;pect. I &s;hall not &s;ay a &s;entence of the undi&s;tingui&s;hed cen&s;ure you pa&s;s upon the mi|ni&s;ters of religion. I a&s;k you, have you con&s;i|dered the proofs in favour of chri&s;tianity from <HI>prophecy,</HI> and <HI>miracles,</HI> from the <HI>purity</HI> of its doctrines, and the <HI>efficacy</HI> of its publication;
<PB N="140" REF="138">
from the agreement between our own expe|rience, and the di&s;coveries which it makes. If the&s;e &s;ubjects be new to you, and they ap|pear to be &s;o, you &s;peak of what you know nothing of, and &s;hew a &s;trange di&s;po&s;ition to render others as unhappy as your&s;elf, depriving them of what is their &s;taff, and con&s;olation. You quarrel my friend, with chri&s;tianity. The quarrel I &s;u&s;pect ought to be with your&s;elf. Your heart, perhaps and life, is not right with God. You tremble at the thought of a future world, and would laugh it out of exi&s;tence. Enter upon a new life; &s;eek a new nature. The ground of your quarrel with chri&s;tianity being now ended, you would &s;ee with new eyes, and confe&s;s that indeed it proceeds from God.</P>
<P>I &s;hall next addre&s;s my&s;elf to tho&s;e who are not yet fully e&s;tabli&s;hed in the faith. "Like a wave of the &s;ea you are driven with the wind, and to&s;&s;ed.

I would not have you fond of di&s;puting upon the pe|culiarities of this or the other church. You may di&s;pute for ever, and gain no advantage. The&s;e di&s;putes &s;upply the infidel with arms. To the church to which choice, or education, or providence has attached you, be &s;teady, but avoid ferments of all kinds. The&s;e open the mouths of infidels, and &s;hake the &s;teadfa&s;t|ne&s;s of the weak. Leaving others to their own ma&s;ter, let it principally be your endea|vour to have a con&s;cience void of offence, toward God and toward man. Be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed for your piety, for your purity, for your moderation. Whil&s;t &s;ome u&s;e the &s;crip|ture as a club to injure their neighbours, do you u&s;e it as a &s;taff for your own &s;tay and con|&s;olation. Whil&s;t many are zealous without knowledge, be you zealous to excel all the world in love, both to God, and to man. Thus may the weak be e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the &s;trong advanced. Were men to give more attention to their hearts and lives, than to forms and words, it would be both to their own comfort, and to their honour of religion. <HI>I be&s;eech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye pre&s;ent your bodies a living &s;acrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your rea&s;onable

<P>What incurs the judgments of God, is very evident. Certain characters are regi&s;tered to condemnation. What has befallen other &s;in|ners of equal notoriety, may be con&s;idered as hanging over us. The crimes expo&s;ed to the judgments &s;poken of in my text, may be cla&s;&s;ed under three heads. The <HI>irreligious,</HI> the <HI>di&s;&s;i|pated,</HI> the <HI>oppre&s;&s;ive,</HI> are ever in the utmo&s;t danger.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="143" MS="y">Irreligion is the root of all crimes, it con|&s;i&s;ts in unworthy thoughts of God, and un|worthy behaviour towards him. Adam did not believe that death would attend his di&s;obe|dience. If God threatens, certainly he will not execute. Incon&s;iderate was his mind, and ungrateful, &s;elf-willed and perver&s;e. Too exactly is the &s;ame image received by his &s;ons, and tran&s;mitted through &s;ucceeding generati|ons. Different circum&s;tances may place it in different &s;hades, but the likene&s;s is &s;triking. The Heathens were &s;o be&s;otted and fooli&s;h, as to change the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and to four-footed bea&s;ts, and creeping things. Purity in heart and life, was not &s;o much thought of, as exactne&s;s in &s;ome external rites and ceremonies. The Jews had advantages which were denied the Heathen. Their di&s;po&s;itions however, were often the &s;ame. Their prophets, at times, indeed, had no rea&s;on to blame any neglect in the ritual pro&s;cribed by Mo&s;es. In this they were &s;crupolou&s;ly preci&s;e. It was however all parade. They did not &s;anctify God in their hearts, nor did they honour him in their lives. There were times al&s;o when the ritual pre|&s;cribed by Mo&s;es was overlooked. The ho|mage due to the God of I&s;rael only, was payed to idols. The name, the day, the ordinances of God were prophaned, and di&s;pi&s;ed. It were well had this root of bitterne&s;s been extirpated after the introduction of chri&s;|tianity.
<PB N="146" REF="144" MS="y">
Alas it has often &s;prung up to the detriment of mankind. I need not give you a detail of irreligion, as the di&s;grace of chri&s;tian countries, and chri&s;tian &s;ocieties in every age. To the intelligent this is too well known. Let late years, and this country bare witne&s;s of the &s;ad truth. The revolution which gave America her independence, affected her religi|ous principles. The prejudices of former years were rejected; what her ance&s;tors ac|counted &s;acred, &s;he threw off as trifling, per|haps pernicious. Reformation is commenda|ble, but men &s;eldom keep the medium. Di&s;|covering errors on one &s;ide, they hurry into errors on the other. If the fathers have handed down human inventions as religion, the children rejecting the&s;e inventions, have rejected religion it&s;elf. Infidelity has deep root in this country; it is of luxuriant growth. The ignorance in which the youth are brought up, with whom no pains is taken to form them to manly, &s;piritual, &s;olid principles, affords a di&s;mal pro&s;pect. By &s;ome religion is con|temned, by others &s;omething is &s;ub&s;tituted for religion, which cannot bear the te&s;t. The deriders of religion are very numerous; they are countenanced by multitudes of pro|phane &s;wearers, daring &s;abbath-breakers, of tho&s;e who con&s;tantly neglect religious ordi|nances, of a public or private nature. And when &s;ome attention is paid to religion, promoting a party, quieting an unea&s;y mind, the im|pul&s;e of the moment, &s;uddenly felt, &s;uddenly

removed, is the foundation on which their re|ligion re&s;ts. It is a foundation of &s;and, which the floods &s;hall &s;weep away. Few experience the refined, the heavenly, the divine principles which chri&s;tianity in&s;pires, founded on love to God and man, on obedience to Chri&s;t, and conformity to his example Irreligion a&s;|&s;umes di&s;gui&s;es &s;uitable to the age, and to the &s;tate of &s;ociety. It appears in this country with a bold countenance. Like a flood, it has deluged the land. Men either keep God alto|gether out of view, or believe him to be &s;uch a one as them&s;elves, but he will reprove them, and &s;et their &s;ins in order before their eyes.</P>
<P>The di&s;&s;ipated are a &s;econd cla&s;s of people, who draw down divine judgments upon a na|tion, the Antedeluvian world was &s;unk in di&s;&s;ipation, and &s;ecurity, nothing was thought of but plea&s;ing the eye, gratifying the ta&s;te, and making a &s;how in life. <HI>They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark; and the flood came and de&s;troyed them all.</HI> The lives men led in Lot's day, were the &s;ame. <HI>Likewi&s;e al&s;o, was it in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they &s;old, they planted, they builded.

in their place. The pre&s;ent life could not otherwi&s;e be maintained, nor could we otherwi&s;e enjoy &s;uch comfort as this world is calculated to afford. Exce&s;s in things of them&s;elves good, may convert them into evil. This is particularly true of the things now mentioned. Let them engro&s;s the whole at|tention; let them be con&s;idered as our chief good; let them be &s;ought after with un&s;atiable de&s;ire; let them &s;o entirely intoxicate the &s;oul, as &s;hall incapacitate us from attending to any other intere&s;t. <HI>But they that will be rich, fall into temptation, and a &s;nare, and into many fool|i&s;h and hurtful lu&s;ts, which drown men in de&s;truc|tion and perdition.</HI> In Sodom were found pride, fullne&s;s of bread, and abundance of idlene&s;s, neither did they &s;trengthen the hands of the poor, and the needy. Men thus pro&s;|titute to the world what God had re&s;erved for him&s;elf. They act in oppo&s;ition to his will; they are declared to be in a &s;tate of enmity. From this crime America, I am afraid, can|not be vindicated. Since the revolution &s;he has enjoyed uncommon pro&s;perity. The in|du&s;trous find it ea&s;y to live in independent, if not affluent circum&s;tances. What are the con|&s;equences? Are Americans grateful to Pro|vidence? Are they frugal? Are they charitable? Let an an&s;wer be given from a neighbouring city. The &s;eat of government, the centre of trade, the receptacle of wealth, once celebrated

for the purity of her manners, and &s;ymplicity in her &s;tyle of living, what extravagance, what luxury, what folly, what vice, the di&s;grace of European countries, has not gained a footing there, and been &s;uffered to tyrannize over arbi|trary &s;way? How is the gold become dim? The mo&s;t fine gold changed? Degeneracy of a pe&s;tilential nature, has &s;pread through the land. Americans &s;corning to lead frugal, in|du&s;trious, temperate lives, which at once would promote their honour and happine&s;s, have been infatuated by a &s;peculating, unbound|ed &s;pirit, ruinous to the &s;oul, and fatal to &s;ocie|ty. <HI>Shall I not vi&s;it for the&s;e things? &s;aith the Lord: and &s;hall not my &s;oul be avenged on &s;uch a nation as this?</HI></P>
<P>The oppre&s;&s;ive, as well as the irreligious, and di&s;&s;ipated, are in the utmo&s;t danger. Among other crimes fatal to man in Noah's day, it is expre&s;sly &s;aid that the earth was fil|led with violence. Before the ruin, in which Jeru&s;alem was involved by the Roman army, much oppre&s;&s;ion and violence were found in her. Take, as an example of this, an intere&s;t|ing incident in our Saviour's life: to intimi|date him from pro&s;ecuting his work, the Pha|ri&s;ees took an opportunity of addre&s;&s;ing him. <HI>The &s;ame day there came certain of the Phari&s;ees, &s;aying unto him, get thee out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill thee. And he &s;aid unto them, Go ye and tell that fox, behold I ca&s;t out devils,

It is however, to be lament|ed, that oppre&s;&s;ive conduct is not altogether unknown. In &s;ome &s;tates it is not ea&s;y to recover a ju&s;t debt, in others, &s;laves are treated with a rigor unbecoming in the treatment of the children of the &s;ame parent, the purcha&s;e of the &s;ame blood, the candidates for the &s;ame immortality. Government, no doubt, have good rea&s;ons for pro&s;ecuting the war on the frontiers. Would to God the&s;e rea&s;ons no long|er exi&s;ted. War commonly includes blame on both &s;ides. The apo&s;tle James was &s;en&s;i|ble of this. <HI>From whence come wars, and fight|ing among you? Come they not hence, even of your lu&s;ts that war in your members?

nation is increa&s;ed, thus national judgments are incurred. I am naturally led,</P>
<P N="2">II. To examine the nature of the&s;e judgments &s;pecified in my text. The &s;word is mentioned the fir&s;t of the four judgments with which God corrects the nations. God challenges it as his peculiar prerogative. <HI>I make peace and cre|ate evil. If I,</HI> &s;ays God, in the &s;ame chapter, <HI>bring a &s;word upon that land, and &s;ay, &s;word go through the land, &s;o that I cut off man and bea&s;t from it. The Heathen raged,</HI> &s;ays the p&s;almi&s;t, &s;peaking of wars. <HI>The kingdoms were moved, he uttered his voice, the earth melted.</HI> The I&s;|raelites were environed by ho&s;tile nations, rea|dy, on all occa&s;ions, to break in upon them, to do them mi&s;chief; it was enjoined by their religion, that their men repair thrice a-year to Jeru&s;alem. Was not this leaving their lands expo&s;ed? Was it not inviting the incur&s;ions of their enemies? God him&s;elf removes this objection. <HI>Thrice in the year &s;hall all your men-children appear before the Lord God, the God of I&s;rael; for I will ca&s;t out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither &s;hall any man de|&s;ire thy land, when thou &s;hall go up to appear be|fore the Lord thy God, thrice in the year.</HI> God governs by a re&s;training and a directing pow|er. He &s;ays to the &s;ea, "Thus far &s;halt thou come, and no farther. Even the wrath of man prai&s;es him, and the remainder of wrath he re&s;trains." This interference is of &s;o won|derful a nature, that it is the &s;ubject of faith,
<PB N="151" REF="150">
rather than of &s;en&s;e. God may act through the in&s;trumentality of good or evil angels, of pious or wicked men. When the Sabeans, and Chaldeans, excited by the evil one, break|ing in, plundered Job of all his &s;ub&s;tance, did he cur&s;e their free-booters, and give vent to his vexation in oaths, and execrations? No, Job was more devout. He ob&s;erved the hand of a father in this &s;troke. "The Lord gave," &s;ays he, "and the Lord hath taken away." When Shimei in&s;ulted David, in his adver&s;ity, and cur&s;ed him, David re&s;trained his &s;ervants from taking his life, &s;aying. "So let him cur&s;e, becau&s;e the Lord hath &s;aid unto him, cur&s;e David." Politicians a&s;&s;ign very plau&s;able rea|&s;ons for wars, and their different progre&s;s. Infidels acquie&s;ce in the&s;e, and reject the in|terference of a divine government, but devout per&s;ons con&s;ider wars as the rod with which God corrects the nations, and brings about his own purpo&s;es. By this rod our country is &s;courged. Americans are too apt to think de&s;picably of the Indians. I know not what they are in them&s;elves; as in&s;truments in the hand of providence, there is no calamity which they may not bring upon this country. I cannot help conceiving their power to be terri|ble. They have &s;tained in different battles, the American arms. One who had faced them in the field, &s;peaks of being expo&s;ed to the cruelties of a &s;avage foe, the mo&s;t &s;ubtle, and I will take upon me to &s;ay, the mo&s;t for|midable of any people upon the face of G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d's

earth. We are not yet much affected by the wars in Europe; let us be thankful on this ac|count.

<P>Egypt, in the days of Jo&s;eph, a land le&s;s &s;ubject to this calamity, being more fertile than mo&s;t others, was vi&s;ited with famine for &s;even years. The &s;ame calamity fell up|on Judea, and for the &s;ame &s;pace, during Ahab's reign. Famines are foretold, as a pre&s;age of the de&s;truction which of Jeru&s;alem. Ameri|cans may believe them&s;elves &s;afe from this calamity; let them not boa&s;t; it is in the &s;tore of the divine judgements; he can call for it
<PB N="153" REF="152" MS="y">
when he plea&s;eth to execute his vengeance. The He&s;&s;ian fly, which did &s;uch mi&s;chief &s;ome years pa&s;t, the bla&s;ting and milldew, of which farmers complain la&s;t year, may warn Americans, that their &s;taff of bread is with God, who may break it whenever their crimes provoke this calamity. The prophet menti|ons the noi&s;ome bea&s;t as a third judgement, with which God corrects the nations. God promi&s;es I&s;rael, <HI>I will &s;end hornets before thee which &s;hall drive out the Hivite, the Cannanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.</HI> The hornet is bigger than the wa&s;p, and of the &s;ame &s;pe|cies. It is exceedingly fierce; its &s;ting oc|ca&s;ions fevers. It aims particularly again&s;t the eye. Jo&s;hua a&s;cribes his victory over the Amorites to the&s;e in&s;ects, who darting again&s;t the enemy, made them &s;o blind, that they could not &s;ee to fight. <HI>And I &s;ent the hornet before you, which drove them out before you, even the two kings of the Amorites, but not with thy &s;word, nor with thy bow.</HI> God &s;ent among the Egyptians, divers &s;orts of flies, which de|voured them, and frogs which de&s;troyed them. If the mo&s;t contemptible creatures may be u&s;ed for the puni&s;hment of a nation, may not al&s;o the more formidable. When the prophet cur&s;ed the profane children in the name of the Lord, as they went to Bethel, there came forth two &s;he-bears out of the wood, and tore forty and two of them. This happened by divine direction, and was
<PB N="154" REF="153" MS="y">
an immediate judgment from God. It is expre&s;sly &s;aid in this chapter by God him&s;elf. <HI>I cau&s;e noi&s;ome bea&s;ts to pa&s;s through the land, and &s;poil it, &s;o that it be de&s;olate, that no man may pa&s;s through for &s;ake of the bea&s;ts.</HI> Incon|&s;iderate people, when incommoded by in|&s;ects, or otherwi&s;e, think nothing of God. The devout ob&s;erve the hand of God, in all that befalls them.</P>
<P>The la&s;t judgment mentioned by the pro|phet, whereby God puni&s;hes a guilty nation, is the pe&s;tilence. It is much ea&s;ier to give a hi&s;tory of the pe&s;tilence, than to inve&s;tigate whence it proceeds, and how it is communi|cated. It is highly epidemical; it may pa&s;s from land to land in goods, or clothes. This we may know with &s;ufficient certainty, that when God is plea&s;ed with a nation, he takes &s;ickne&s;s away from the mid&s;t of it, when di&s;plea&s;ed he &s;ends the pe&s;tilence to cut off from it man and bea&s;t. A pe&s;tilence de&s;troy|ed Sennacherib's army, wa&s;ted Judea towards the conclu&s;ion of David's reign, carried off the fir&s;t born of Egypt. In all the&s;e ca&s;es the in&s;trumentality of an angel, is mentioned. The p&s;almi&s;t &s;peaks of <HI>the pe&s;tilence which walketh in darkne&s;s,</HI> evidently meaning that the cau&s;es of this di&s;order cannot be a&s;certain|ed. They elude the mo&s;t diligent &s;earch: in the &s;ame p&s;alm the pe&s;tilence is compared to a fowler's &s;nare. Its venom catches men
<PB N="155" REF="154" MS="y">
as in&s;en&s;ibly, and &s;uddenly, as the &s;nare doth the bird when it is laid with much cunning. During the Peloponne&s;ian war, a dreadful plague carried off, in one year, an infinite num|ber of the Athenians. The year in which it began was of all others, the mo&s;t healthy, and free from di&s;ea&s;es. The Athenians believed them&s;elves puni&s;hed for &s;ome acts of &s;acrilege, of which they had been guilty. Thucydides acknowledges that he could not account for its introduction.</P>
<P>One of Ca&s;&s;ius's &s;oldiers having found at Babylon, under ground, a &s;mall golden coffer; opening it, &s;uch pe&s;tilential vapours aro&s;e, as infected all who were pre&s;ent, &s;pread through the army, de&s;olated the provinces wherever they marched, and was attended with great mortality, to the remote&s;t parts of the empire. A plague raged in Con&s;tantine's reign, with fury for three years, in Sicily, Greece, the i&s;lands of the Aegoean &s;ea, and Con&s;tantino|ple, that the living could &s;carcely bury the dead. In the reign of Micip&s;a of Numidia, a great part of Africa was covered with locu&s;ts which de&s;troyed the produce of the earth, and even wood, driven away by a &s;trong wind into the African &s;ea, out of which being in va&s;t heaps, a plague aro&s;e which did un&s;peakable mi&s;chief. It raged in the city of Ittica, in &s;uch a degree, that 1500 dead bodies were carried out of one gate in a year. Of the
<PB N="156" REF="155" MS="y">
plauge which raged in London in the year 1665, we have very circum&s;tantial accounts. It had been imported through Holland, from the Levant; it de&s;olated the family in which it broke out; it &s;pread through the neigh|bourhood. Appearances alarmed the city. The bills of mortality in a week, were be|tween 240 and 300, though they increa&s;ed in a &s;hort time to 474. A &s;evere fro&s;t in Janu|ary, continuing &s;everal weeks, the di&s;order abated, and the apprehen&s;ions of the citizens cea&s;ed. In May it broke out anew with increa&s;ing violence; all who could, left the city. Fer|ments ari&s;ing from religious differences &s;ub|&s;ided; the inns of court were &s;hut up; no contention about worldly intere&s;ts; all were at peace. The people crowded the churches with uncommon ardor. By the month of Augu&s;t, a thou&s;and died in a day. In Septem|ber, 1600 were dying one day with another. People were almo&s;t driven to de&s;pair. The contagion de&s;pi&s;ed all medicine. At this moment, when hope was gone, and the city nearly depopulated, the di&s;ea&s;e in&s;tantly &s;top|ped. The phy&s;icians were a&s;toni&s;hed. All their patients were well. The contagion no more appeared. The mo&s;t irreligious could not help acknowledging that this was the hand of God.</P>
<P>Our country has not been &s;ubject to this de&s;olating calamity. It has, however, fallen
<PB N="157" REF="156" MS="y">
upon us. The de&s;troying angel has received the commi&s;&s;ion; he has un&s;heathed his &s;word; he &s;preads de&s;truction. Our brethren in Phi|ladelphia de&s;erve our &s;ympathy. Multitudes have been cut off; multitudes are in danger; multitudes are alarmed. Their minds are much affected. Take for example, a letter I lately received from my friend Doctor Ru&s;h. I had informed him of our intentions this day. "Many thanks," &s;ays he, <Q>to you, for your propo&s;ed fa&s;t day for our di&s;tre&s;&s;ed city. The di&s;ea&s;e, who&s;e ravages you mean to deprecate, &s;till prevails. Never before did I witne&s;s &s;uch deep, and univer&s;al di&s;|tre&s;s. Continue fervently to pray for our citi|zens, and for none oftener than your &s;incere friend.</Q> Such are the judgments with which God vi&s;its a guilty nation. Some times one is &s;ent; &s;ome times another; &s;ome times the whole appear in dreadful array. I come now,</P>
<P N="3">III. To &s;how how certainly the&s;e judgments fall on a people, when incurred. There is a remarkable pa&s;&s;age in the book of Gene&s;is. God promi&s;ed to Abraham the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of Canaan, and mentioned as a rea&s;on that the promi&s;e was not immediately per|formed. <Q>The iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.</Q> There were many pious people; Melchizedec for in&s;tance, Mamre, E&s;hcol, and others, who, as &s;alt pre&s;erved the
<PB N="158" REF="157" MS="y">
land from degeneracy. The land was not ripe for de&s;truction There is a certain height in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, at which, when a nation ar|rives, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y can no longer be forborne. Then no inte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce&s;&s;ions on their b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">half can be of any av<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">. The decree is pa&s;&s;ed. In the puni&s;h|ment there can be no delay, no abatement. The old world was &s;o entirely abandoned, that in Noah's family alone could any good|ne&s;s be found. Frequently, no doubt, did this pious patriarch bewail the &s;tate of mankind, and pray for their reformation. But the fatal moment arrived; the de&s;truction of mankind was inevitable. Abraham interceeds for the cities of the plain, and his interce&s;&s;ions had pre|vailed for their deliverance, had ten righteous per&s;ons been found among&s;t them. The de|generacy was &s;o deep, &s;o univer&s;al, that even this number of that character could not be found among all the multitudes, with which the&s;e cities abounded.</P>
<P>When Canaan was puni&s;hed by the &s;word of Jo&s;hua, Rahab was the only pious per&s;on in the whole country. Jeru&s;alem was daring|ly wicked when the Roman armies executed upon it the divine judgments. A little before the day of judgment, wickedne&s;s, we have rea|&s;on to think, &s;hall attain an atrocity un|known on earth before. Let the wickedne&s;s of a city, a country, an empire, become uni|ver&s;al and atrocious, were the per&s;ons who&s;e
<PB N="159" REF="158" MS="y">
prayers availed much for their cotemporaries pre&s;ent, interceeding for a people thus circum|&s;tanced, it could not be effectual. <HI>Though No|ah, Daniel, and Job, were there, as I live, &s;aith the Lord God, they &s;hall deliver neither &s;on nor daughter; they &s;hall but deliver their own &s;ouls by their righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Nay, let them not pray then; the accepted time is e&s;caped, and the day of &s;alvation. With him they mu&s;t be left, who has &s;aid "vengeance is mine, I will re|pay."</P>
<P>After examining <HI>what incurs</HI> the divine judgments; the <HI>nature</HI> of tho&s;e judgments &s;pecified in my text, and the <HI>certainty</HI> of their falling upon a people when incured, I am prepared in the</P>
<P N="4">IV Place, to mention the be&s;t &s;ecurity of individuals again&s;t the&s;e judgments. What crimes incur the divine judgments? Are the irreligious, the di&s;&s;ipated, the oppre&s;&s;ive, the troublers of the land? Do they provoke the Lord to anger? Do they draw down ven|geance on a people? If you be of a different character; if you &s;anctify the Lord God in your hearts; if you be mortified to the world; if you do to others as you would that they &s;hould do to you; in &s;o far you di&s;countenance the crimes for which God pleads again&s;t a na|tion, and may expect either exemption from the judgments which are incurred, or &s;ome advantage, &s;hould the&s;e reach you. The
<PB N="160" REF="159" MS="y">
Lord knoweth how to deliver the Godly out of temptation. The righteous &s;hall &s;ave their &s;ouls alive. A thou&s;and may fall at their &s;ide, ten thou&s;and at their right hand, but the de&s;truction &s;hall not come near unto them. Noah e&s;capes from the de&s;truction of the old world; Lot from the de&s;truction of Sodom; Rahab is not lo&s;t in Jericho, nor the chri&s;tians in Jeru&s;alem. God di&s;tingui&s;hes between the righteous and the wicked. I &s;ay not, that the righteous are always &s;afe in national ca|lamities: No&mdash;one event is common to them with the wicked. But particular care is taken of them. The fire which con|&s;umes the wicked, refines the righteous. If it be for their advantage, they &s;hall live; if bet|ter things be intended them, they &s;hall be re|moved to regions of peace. A father cha&s;tens the one, a judge puni&s;hes the other. We &s;ee a little way, therefore cannot decide po&s;itively, on what is doing in our world; but we have rea&s;on to believe it &s;hall be well with the righ|teous. To them godline&s;s is great gain. If they be long continued on earth, men &s;hall be benefited by their example and prayers; if they be taken to heaven, they &s;hall experience fullne&s;s of joy, and plea&s;ures for evermore.</P>
<P>Having fini&s;hed the ob&s;ervations I intended for the illu&s;tration of this pa&s;&s;age, I &s;hall con|clude with an addre&s;s to per&s;ons of different characters.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="160" MS="y">It is very evident that national guilt draws down national calamities. This guilt may ari&s;e, not only from &s;uch public acts as are oppre&s;&s;ive, and &s;uch laws as are unju&s;t; but when the manners and lives of individuals are notoriou&s;ly corrupted, hereby national guilt is contracted and accumulated. The idle and the di&s;&s;ipated, the profane &s;wearer, and daring &s;abbath-breaker; he who neglects religion, and he who makes it the &s;ubject of his de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;i|on, trouble &s;ociety, and expo&s;e it to divine vengeance. Upon you, in &s;ome mea&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e, may be charged the blood which drenches the frontier &s;ettlements; the pe&s;tilence which lays wa&s;te a neighbouring city; the mi&s;chief done during &s;ome years by the He&s;&s;ian fly; during the la&s;t year by bla&s;ting and mildew. Societies, &s;maller and larger, are made up of individuals. Let each individual reform, and reformation in the &s;ociety, be it ever &s;o exten&s;ive, will &s;oon be apparent. It may be objected, had we any concern in the guilt we &s;hould feel the puni&s;hment, we al&s;o &s;hould langui&s;h, and bleed, and die. Tho&s;e who&s;e blood Pilate mingled with their &s;acrifices, or tho&s;e who were cru&s;hed under the tower of Siloam were not, as our Saviour a&s;&s;ures, more atroci|ous &s;inners than their brethren. Examples are nece&s;&s;ary for the warning of others. We may not be innocent, although at pre&s;ent we
<PB N="162" REF="161" MS="y">
may be &s;afe. If our guilt individually accu|mulates the national guilt, ju&s;tice to the &s;uffer|ers as well as &s;ympathy, requires that each ex|amine his own heart and life; that he confe&s;s and for&s;ake his &s;ins; that he fear God and keep his commandments. Public judgments are intended to bring men to the acknowledg|ment of a Divine Providence, to the reverence and practice of a devout, and religious life. Unle&s;s you do this, you fail in a material in|&s;tance in your duty to &s;ociety, and like Achan in the camp of I&s;rael, bring &s;hame, di&s;appoint|ment, and ruin upon the nation. Society re|&s;embles the human body. If one member &s;uffers the whole &s;uffers with it. Should we be &s;o inattentive and perver&s;e, as to learn no wi&s;dom from the di&s;tre&s;s in which our bre|thren, at a di&s;tance, are involved, di&s;tre&s;s may approach near and fall upon our neighbours, our families, our own per&s;ons. For God's &s;ake my brethren, for the &s;ake of &s;ociety, for your own &s;akes, let all &s;incerely and re&s;olutely con|fe&s;s and for&s;ake their &s;ins, that the pro&s;perity of this country may not be bla&s;ted in the bud. This is a favorite country: It has enjoyed the &s;miles of heaven: It is an a&s;ylum to the af|flicted, through the earth. In proportion to our happine&s;s is our ingratitude, if we act un|worthily of that happine&s;s. Shall the ox know his owner, and the a&s;s his ma&s;ter's crib, and Americans not know God? Americans not acknowledge his providence! Waxing fat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="163" REF="162">
&s;hall they kick, forgetting the God that made them, and lightly e&s;teeming the work of their &s;alvation! To us indeed, belong &s;hame and confu&s;ion of face. Let the remembrance lay us in the du&s;t, and fill us with humliity and contrition of &s;pirit.</P>
<P>However far we may have gone a&s;tray, there is every thing to encourage our peni|tence and reformation. Ezekiel beheld a mark &s;et upon tho&s;e who bewailed the guilt which drew down upon Judea heavy judgments. Regard was paid to their per&s;ons, and to their prayers. Had there been ten righteous per|&s;ons in the cities of the plain, they had not been de&s;troyed. For the elect's &s;ake, the judgments which fell upon Jeru&s;alem, were much mitigated. In this re&s;pect, the righte|ous are better than their neighbours. They are the &s;alt which pre&s;erves &s;ociety from ruin. Let each &s;eek God by fa&s;ting and prayer. It may avail much, both for effecting the refor|mation of America, and &s;u&s;pending the judg|ments which hang over it. Some kinds of calamities, as our Saviour a&s;&s;ures us, can be removed by prayer and fa&s;ting only. E&s;ther found this very effectual for di&s;&s;ipating a dark cloud which threatened her nation. The Ninivites hereby prevented the de&s;truction of their city. When Daniel be&s;ought God for the captives at Babylon, by fa&s;ting and prayer, whil&s;t he was yet &s;peaking, the command for
<PB N="164" REF="163" MS="y">
their deliverance went forth from Cyrus. There is hope wherever a &s;pirit of grace and &s;upplication is found. I am per&s;uaded there are many in this land who fear God. Let them with one heart, and one voice, bewail the national guilt, under which this country groans Let them deprecate the judgments which are now among&s;t us. Let them di&s;|cover a greater love for one another, a greater attention to God as a Spirit, wor&s;hipping him in &s;pirit and in truth. Let them herewith prove him whether he will not pour out upon them a ble&s;&s;ing that there &s;hall not be room enough to receive it; whether he will not re|buke the devourer for their &s;akes. <Q>All nations &s;hall call America ble&s;&s;ed; for ye &s;hall be a delight&s;ome land, &s;aith the Lord of ho&s;ts.</Q></P>
