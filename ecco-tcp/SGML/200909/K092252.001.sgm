<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a cu&s;tom with &s;ome authors to intro|duce their works by a prefatory appeal to the candour of the Reader, and circum&s;tances may undoubtedly combine to ju&s;tify the mea|&s;ure; but when a man acts from his own free motives in re&s;orting to the pre&s;s, how can he be warranted for intruding on the Public without a proper confidence in his powers for entertaining them? True re&s;pect to the Reader refers it&s;elf to his judgment, and makes no attempts upon his pity. The purcha&s;er of the&s;e volumes would have ju&s;t rea&s;on to com|plain of his bargain, if he were to find nothing in them but a &s;ample of my mode&s;ty in the Preface, and a long dull &s;tory at the end of it; and I &s;hould only prove that I thought more meanly of his ta&s;te than of my own talents, were I to pre&s;ume that he could be well
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
plea&s;ed with a production, of which my own opinion was &s;o very humble, as to &s;tand in need of an apology for pre&s;enting it to him: I therefore hold it as fair dealing to premi&s;e, thar, if the&s;e volumes do not merit his appro|bation, they have &s;mall claim upon his can|dour, fora&s;much as they have been carefully and deliberately written, &s;ome years having pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince the fir&s;t hand was put to them; during which no diligence has been &s;pared to make them worthy, both in &s;tile and matter, of that generous Public, who are &s;o ju&s;tly in|titled to every grateful exertion on my part, and to who&s;e future favours it is my be&s;t am|bition to a&s;pire.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER I. The high Dignity, Powers, and Prerogatives of the Novel Writer.</HEAD>
<P>ALL the world will acknowledge the &s;upe|riority of works of invention over tho&s;e of compilation. The writer of novels, there|fore, will take rank before the writer of mat|ter of fact, and re&s;t his title to precedence upon his proofs of originality. Po&s;&s;ibly this may be ill reli&s;hed by the hi&s;torian, who holds him&s;elf as an author of a high cla&s;s; and, indeed, it &s;eems to bear a little hard upon his prero|gatives, who, generally &s;peaking, can boa&s;t as good a &s;hare of invention as tho&s;e who more immediately profe&s;s it.</P>
<P>The accounts which hi&s;torians favour us with of the early ages and origin of nations would be novels, if fiction alone could make them &s;uch; but having only the improbabili|ties, without the amu&s;ing properties, of Fairy
<PB N="2" REF="8">
Tales and Arabian Nights, they cannot rank even with the lowe&s;t works of fancy.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tories of the heroic ages are better entitled to be con&s;idered as romances: the ad|ventures of a Hercules, a The&s;eus and a Ja|&s;on, afford &s;ome little entertainment to the reader, but it is a compliment to call them the <HI>Quixotes</HI> of antiquity.</P>
<P>The writers of the lives of illu&s;trious per|&s;ons, like the noveli&s;ts, generally make their own hero; but not often with the &s;ame atten|tion to nature: the lying legends of Pythago|ras, Abaris and Apollonius would not pa&s;s upon the world in any fiction, that did not avowedly bid defiance to credibility.</P>
<P>The liberty &s;ome writers take of embelli&s;h|ing their hi&s;tories with florid &s;peeches and de|clamations, put into the mouths of people who, probably, never uttered a &s;ingle &s;en|tence as it is &s;et down in their parts, is a palpable intru&s;ion on the province of the dra|mati&s;t or noveli&s;t, who, building fables upon old foundations, with the help of a few hi&s;toric characters and facts, give an air of truth to fiction. Here I might in&s;tance tho&s;e amu&s;ing fabrications in our own times, entitled Par|liamentary Debates, where truth and &s;hort|hand
<PB N="3" REF="9">
have no &s;hare with invention, and the &s;enator's be&s;t hi&s;torian is he that is lea&s;t faithful to his words.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, there have been, and &s;till are, many more noveli&s;ts in the world of letters, than have taken credit to them&s;elves for it, or perhaps ever &s;u&s;pected they were entitled &s;o to do.</P>
<P>After all, it is only in the profe&s;&s;ed depart|ment of the novel that true and ab&s;olute li|berty is enjoyed. If I was now writing the hi&s;tory of Alexander the Great, who, as every body believes, died of a drunken fit, let me do what I will with him in the career of his victories, drunk he mu&s;t be at la&s;t, and drunk he mu&s;t die. With the hero of my novel it is otherwi&s;e: over him I have de&s;potic power; his fate and fortune, life or death, depend on my will; and whether I &s;hall crown him with length of days and pro&s;perity, or cut &s;hort his thread by an untimely &s;troke, is a que&s;tion within my own choice to determine; and though I mu&s;t account to nature and probabi|lity for the regularity of my proceedings, no appeal lies to truth and matter of fact again&s;t my po&s;itive deci&s;ion in the ca&s;e. I have tho&s;e powers in my hand which the hi&s;torian, pro|perly
<PB N="4" REF="10">
&s;o called, hath not; I am not tied down to any incidents and events which I cannot over-rule; I may deal puni&s;hment to the evil, and reward to the good, which he who&s;e pen mu&s;t record the di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence rarely hath in his power to do: for the moral of my &s;tory, therefore, I am fairly re&s;pon&s;ible, and no le&s;s for the purity of the narrative; for though the real &s;cenes of life can hardly fail to contaminate the page that records them, the writer who invents impurities is without ex|cu&s;e.</P>
<P>I know that the privileges of the noveli&s;t are more than can well be defined, and his range wider than that portion of created nature which is known to us; yet I do not meditate to &s;tretch my rights &s;o far, nor &s;hall put my pri|vileges to their full exertion: it is not my ambition to run truth out of &s;ight, or put credulity out of breath by following me; I do not propo&s;e to make any demands upon my hero that he cannot rea&s;onably fulfil, or pre&s;s him into &s;treights from which virtue, by its native energy, cannot extricate her&s;elf with ea&s;e; I &s;hall require of him no &s;acrifices for the &s;ake of public fame, no pedantic, o&s;tenta|tious apathy, for his lot is humble, and his
<PB N="5" REF="11">
feelings natural; I &s;hall let him &s;wim with the current, and not &s;trive to tow him again&s;t the &s;tream of probability.</P>
<P>I know that I could play my puppets after my own fancy, for the wires are in my hand; that I could make them declaim like heroes in a tragedy, or gabble like a gang of gyp&s;ies under a hedge; that I could weave my fable, as the Turks do carpets, without counterfeit|ing the likene&s;s of any one thing in earth, &s;ea, or air; produce beings out of nature, that no &s;ober author ever dreamt of, and force be|ings into nature, that no well-bred reader ever met with: but I have lived long enough to &s;ee wonderful revolutions effected by an intem|perate abu&s;e of power, and &s;hall be cautious how I ri&s;que privileges &s;o precious upon expe|riments &s;o trivial.</P>
<P>I am not &s;ure that I &s;hall make my leading characters happy enough to &s;atisfy the &s;an|guine, &s;erious enough to &s;uit the &s;entimental, or beautiful enough to warm the imagination of the animated reader. Some may think I have not been &s;ufficiently liberal to them in point of fortune, others may wi&s;h I had fa|voured them with a few more ca&s;ualties and mi&s;adventures. I am aware that, in a novel,
<PB N="6" REF="12">
travelling the road is very hazardous, that even taking the air does not &s;ecure the company from a &s;udden overturn in their carriage, and that few adventurers ever &s;et foot in a boat without a &s;oaking in the water; but I have not yet found out the wit of being mi&s;|chievous. I perceive that broken bones are con&s;idered as becoming appendages to young gentlemen when in love; that faintings and hy&s;terics are expected of young ladies upon all tender occa&s;ions; and that a burning hot fever, with a high delirium, is one of the warme&s;t topics we can &s;trike upon, and heightens the charms of a heroine beyond any other expedient that can be &s;tarted for the purpo&s;e. All the&s;e weapons I know are within my reach, and the u&s;e of them I know; but it is a cut-finger bu&s;ine&s;s at be&s;t, and I think them &s;afe&s;t in the &s;heath.</P>
<P>One thing, however, there is for me to do, that cannot be di&s;pen&s;ed with, though I &s;hall, probably, hold it off as long as I can&mdash;I mu&s;t make love, and I am far from &s;ure I &s;hall make it in a &s;tyle to plea&s;e my readers. I wi&s;h to my heart I knew what &s;ort of love they be&s;t like; for there are to many patterns, I am puzzled how to choo&s;e what &s;hall plea&s;e them.
<PB N="7" REF="13">
I have been &s;ometimes told, that the author of <HI>Arundel</HI> was not far from the butt; if &s;o, I hope I am as good a mark&s;man as he is. This, if I rightly remember, was rather point-blank firing; now I am inclined to think I &s;hall give my piece a certain elevation that will &s;end the &s;hot upon a range: but it is no matter how I manage it, &s;o it does but reach the heart at la&s;t.</P>
<P>Precedents in plenty are before me; heroes and heroines of all tempers, characters, and de&s;criptions, love-&s;uits as long as Chancery-&s;uits; hearts conquered at a glance, &s;urprized by treachery, or &s;tormed by impudence&mdash;yet where to fix I know not.</P>
<P>I will a&s;k advice of Nature, and rule my&s;elf by her report.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II. The Hi&s;tory commences.</HEAD>
<P>IT was in a &s;ummer-evening, whil&s;t the &s;un was yet above the horizon, when Doctor Zachary Cawdle, practitioner in phy&s;ic, &s;ur|gery, and man-midwifry, gently ambled acro&s;s the market-place of a certain town, upon the
<PB N="8" REF="14">
ea&s;tern coa&s;t of this happy i&s;land called Eng|land. He was on his road homewards from a patient, whom he had left in that &s;ituation which every good wife will naturally covet, and every prudent &s;pin&s;ter would do well to avoid: he was in high good-humour with his day's work, for his ta&s;k had been ea&s;y and his reward liberal: He had touched a hand|&s;ome fee in ready ca&s;h from the hu&s;band of his patient, for which he had only given him a draft upon time, in the per&s;on of an infant heir; and how many chances and cro&s;&s;es a venture, dependant on the contingency of twenty-one years credit, mu&s;t be liable to, let tho&s;e, who have &s;taked their happine&s;s upon &s;uch expectations, declare.</P>
<P>Zachary, who was indebted to the courte&s;y of his neighbours for putting Doctor before his name, which by their favour was a title not without profit, as well as honour, no &s;ooner made his entry into this place of public re&s;ort, than he was recognized by &s;o many of his friends and cu&s;tomers, that, having no pre&s;ent call upon his time, and being withal a man of a &s;ocial quality, he was induced to make a halt, and to enter into parley on the &s;addle. The annual cu&s;tom of hiring &s;ervants upon
<PB N="9" REF="15">
this day had brought the farmers together in con&s;iderable numbers, and, bu&s;ine&s;s being over, the market-place was clear of the human cattle, with which it had lately been &s;tocked; &s;o that had Zachary been in &s;earch of a &s;tout hind to do the drudgery of his hou&s;e, there was none &s;uch in his eye.</P>
<P>One &s;olitary youth, the refu&s;e as it &s;hould &s;eem, and outca&s;t of the market, was &s;tand|ing in a corner of the &s;quare, where the con|&s;ervators of the public peace had erected a whipping-po&s;t, embelli&s;hed with figures in bas-relief, more to be admired for the moral of the de&s;ign than for the gracefulne&s;s of it's execution. Upon this in&s;trument of correc|tion the afore&s;aid youth was leaning in a mo&s;t di&s;con&s;olate po&s;ture, in the li&s;tle&s;s act of twirl|ing the point of a hazle &s;witch between the crevices of the pavement, and &s;o intent was he upon the melancholy ta&s;k, that Doctor Zachary Cawdle, the treading of who&s;e pal|frey was none of the nimble&s;t or lea&s;t noi&s;y, had brought the head of old Betty nearly in contact with his brea&s;t, before he either rai&s;ed his eyes from the ground, or &s;topt the cir|cumrotatory operation of his hand.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="16">Zachary, who might well be credited for his &s;kill in judging of the human form, having handed &s;o many of his fellow-creatures into the world, and doubtle&s;s di&s;patched not a few out of it, had now, with the eye of a connoi&s;|&s;eur, taken mea&s;ure of the object who &s;eemed &s;o in&s;en&s;ible to his &s;crutiny; and if the hone&s;t farmers had this day &s;taid at home, and &s;ent their dames on the errand, it is more than probable this unlucky candidate, now rejected on all hands, would not have been the la&s;t on the li&s;t; but different &s;ervices require dif|ferent qualifications, and he &s;tands but a poor chance for his election into the offices of carter or ploughman, who has nothing to recom|mend him but the graces of his per&s;on and the harmony of his features.</P>
<P>His apparel, though neither &s;umptuous nor &s;uperfluous, being nothing more than a &s;hort clo&s;e wai&s;tcoat or doublet of blue cloth and breeches of white ticking, was &s;uch however as gave a fair di&s;play to the perfect &s;ymmetry of his form: an arti&s;t would have taken him in his pre&s;ent habit, in preference to the robes of the garter.</P>
<P>Zachary, now rai&s;ing him&s;elf on his &s;tirrups,
<PB N="11" REF="17">
and leaning forward upon the neck of his palfrey, roared out with the voice of authority, <Q REND="inline">"Hark-ye, fellow, can you chu&s;e no better place to re&s;t your back again&s;t than the whip|ping-po&s;t? Gramercy, lad, you'll find him but a treacherous companion, if you tru&s;t your carca&s;e to his keeping; he has made many a lazy back &s;mart before parting, for hugging him &s;o clo&s;ely as you do."</Q></P>
<P>The youth, thus acco&s;ted, rai&s;ed his eyes from the ground, and fixing them on the countenance of the &s;peaker, &s;eemed as if he would have &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"What is your plea&s;ure, &s;ir? I do not under&s;tand your raillery,"</Q>&mdash;at the &s;ame time he lifted from his head the &s;canty remnant of a hat, and pre&s;ented to the eyes of Zachary a countenance, upon which Nature had engro&s;&s;ed in her faire&s;t and mo&s;t legible characters&mdash;<HI>Your je&s;t is mi&s;applied: let the bearer pa&s;s un&s;u&s;pected!</HI></P>
<P>It can hardly be &s;uppo&s;ed, that a per&s;on of Zachary's &s;agacity, and one withal who pro|fe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf a phy&s;iognomi&s;t, could over|look or mi&s;take what was &s;o plain to be &s;een and under&s;tood. The many &s;pecimens he had met with of nature's hand-writing, before hy|pocri&s;y
<PB N="12" REF="18">
had marred the characters, could not but qualify him to read without error a text &s;o fair as was now laid open to his view; and certain it is, he proceeded to que&s;tion the youth in a milder tone, <Q REND="inline">"Why he &s;tood there idle, when the market-place was empty, and all bu&s;ine&s;s over?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e no man had hired him, and he had no where to go,"</Q> was the an&s;wer to this que&s;tion. <Q REND="inline">"Had he no pa|rents?"</Q> the poor lad &s;hook his head and was &s;ilent. The que&s;tion was repeated: it pro|duced nothing but the &s;ame &s;ilence, and the &s;ame melancholy action; he had again rivetted his eyes upon the ground, and was beginning to renew the operation of the hazel twig, work|ing it into the joints of the pavement; when Zachary, who&s;e curio&s;ity was now rou&s;ed, muttered to him&s;elf, <Q REND="inline">"There is a my&s;tery in all this;"</Q> and then, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the lad, added, <Q REND="inline">"Well, well! if you do not chu&s;e to an&s;wer my que&s;tion about your parents, I &s;up|po&s;e you will not &s;cruple to tell me whether you have been in &s;ervice before, who was your la&s;t ma&s;ter, and what employment you are fit for?"</Q> To this the youth replied, <Q REND="inline">"That he had been for a very &s;hort time in the fa|mily of a grazier, in a di&s;tant county; but as
<PB N="13" REF="19">
it was his fir&s;t place, and his &s;ervice in it &s;o &s;hort, he could not &s;ay that he was expert in any menial employment, but he hoped upon a trial he &s;hould be found willing to learn."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That is &s;incere at lea&s;t,"</Q> cried the Doctor; <Q REND="inline">"but as you &s;ay your late ma&s;ter dwells at a di&s;tance, and do not tell me his name, I &s;hall hope you can produce a good te&s;timony under his hand to your character."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I am &s;orry to &s;ay I cannot,"</Q> he replied. <Q REND="inline">"How &s;o, how &s;o?"</Q> quoth Zachary; <Q REND="inline">"ha&s;t left it behind thee, child? or would not he give thee any character?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Not &s;o,"</Q> an&s;wered the youth, <Q REND="inline">"he is free enough to give me a character; but it is &s;uch an one as will never recommend me to another ma&s;ter."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"And do you con|fe&s;s it?"</Q> rejoined the other, &s;omewhat petu|lantly; <Q REND="inline">"if &s;uch be your character, no wonder you are out of place; nay, I &s;hould rather &s;ay you are in the only place proper for you; you are in the right to make friends with the whipping-po&s;t, for I perceive you are in fair train to find employment there, and no where el&s;e."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I am in a likely train to be &s;tarv'd,"</Q> cried the poor lad, with a &s;igh, <Q REND="inline">"if my ma&s;|ter's word is to be taken for truth; but I hope I &s;hall not be corrected for what I never com|mitted:
<PB N="14" REF="20">
'tis puni&s;hment enough to be depriv|ed of the means of earning my bread; 'twill be hard if I am to be flead into the bargain; but God's will be done! I am a helple&s;s crea|ture, and mu&s;t &s;ubmit to my hard fortune. I was born in mi&s;ery, and in mi&s;ery I mu&s;t die."</Q></P>
<P>There is a voice, a look, a tone in truth and innocence, which holds a &s;ympathy with the hearts of tho&s;e, on whom their evidences light, irre&s;i&s;tibly impre&s;&s;ive: what hone&s;t Zachary wore in his bo&s;om, under his left ribs, was fairly made by Nature of real fle&s;h and blood, and not of flint or adamant, or any &s;uch im|penetrable &s;ub&s;tance as &s;he &s;ometimes puts in the place of better workman&s;hip and &s;ofter materials, whereby the owners become as it were ca&s;emated and bomb-proof again&s;t all be&s;iegers, of which number pity and com|pa&s;&s;ion, though in appearance the mo&s;t gentle, are in fact among&s;t the mo&s;t importunate and per&s;evering; in&s;omuch that the &s;aid Zachary had no &s;ooner heard the&s;e words, and reconnoitred the &s;igns and &s;ymbols of truth and innocence, which accompanied them, than he felt &s;omething like a &s;tring or chord vibrating and tingling in the afore&s;aid re|gion

<HEAD>CHAPTER III. A Duck di&s;turbs the Tranquillity of a Doctor.</HEAD>
<P>IF Nature, when &s;he moulded the per&s;on of Doctor Zachary Cawdle, had been aware of the profe&s;&s;ion to which Fortune was in fu|ture to devote her bantling, it may be pre|&s;umed, &s;he would not have forgotten that ex|pedition is one main requi&s;ite in the bu&s;ine&s;s of an accoucheur: but unle&s;s rotundity be a mark of &s;peed, even the per&s;on of Jeffery Gambado of immortal memory had not le&s;s re&s;emblance to a light hor&s;eman, than what hone&s;t Zachary now exhibited on the back of old Betty, upon which he &s;ate a&s;tride with two legs, in &s;hape not unlike the balu&s;trades of a bridge, &s;trutting out from the ribs of his mare, wide as the fork of a pair of compa&s;&s;es, when &s;tretcht upon a globe.</P>
<P>He wore a full &s;uit of cinnamon-coloured
<PB N="19" REF="25">
cloth, with boot cuffs and buckram &s;kirts; a va&s;t bu&s;hy perriwig, clo&s;e dipt and frizzled, like a yew-tree hedge; with an enormous three-cornered hat, mounted peak upwards from the back of his head, which, like the gnomon of the dial, might have &s;erved to mark the hour of noon upon his forehead, had the &s;un been in his meridian. The animal that carried him was of a piece with her rider, a thick un|wieldy clod, of cart-hor&s;e pedigree, &s;low-paced, &s;hort-winded and a huge feeder. No wonder, therefore, if Henry on his feet was more than a match for his ma&s;ter in the &s;addle.</P>
<P>A little brook, that bounded the pari&s;h in which Zachary lived, pretty equally divided their whole line of march, which we have be|fore ob&s;erved did not exceed two miles. Over this &s;tream there was a foot-plank, that af|forded a pa&s;&s;age for Henry, whil&s;t the Doctor proceeded through the ford, where, according to cu&s;tom, he halted to indulge the old mare with a draught of the limpid element, which her un&s;ophi&s;ticated palate preferred to all the fabricated compounds in her owner's &s;hop, or even in his cellar it&s;elf.</P>
<P>At a &s;hort di&s;tance down the &s;tream, was a
<PB N="20" REF="26">
mill, which this water turned. Now it &s;o chanced, as old Betty was moving up the brook in&s;tinctively, in &s;earch of a clearer run, her flouncing in the ford di&s;turbed a duck, who was hovering her young under the bank, and now flew up from her ne&s;t, quacking and flapping her wings in a mo&s;t clamorous man|ner. The din &s;he made, and the &s;uddenne&s;s of the alarm, were too much for the philo&s;ophy even of old Betty to put up with, though few bea&s;ts could boa&s;t of nerves le&s;s irritable than her's; but truth mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, the &s;urprize &s;o totally overpowered her natural phlegm, that having given a vehement plunge in the water, by way of warning to her rider, and following this up rather too precipitately with a &s;udden to&s;s of her head, whil&s;t he was &s;toop|ing forwards to give her the rein, the re&s;pec|tive &s;culls met each other with &s;o much good will, and &s;uch a hearty welcome, that Za|chary's hat and wig, not being fixtures, re|bounded from the concu&s;&s;ion, and proceeded to float down the &s;tream very lovingly toge|ther, as friends &s;hould, towards the mill wheel, till they were arre&s;ted in their progre&s;s by Henry, from the foot-bridge, who fi&s;hed them up with his hazel &s;witch, as they were fairly on
<PB N="21" REF="27">
their way towards their la&s;t home, calling out at the &s;ame time to his ma&s;ter&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Have a care, Sir! hold fa&s;t, or you'll get a &s;ow&s;ing"</Q>&mdash;a caution, which was by no means un&s;ea&s;onable, as the attitude Zachary was then in, upon the crupper of his &s;tartled bea&s;t, was exactly &s;uch as exhibited <HI>&s;ymptoms of falling</HI> in their mo&s;t prominent character.</P>
<P>The duck, who had a friend at home, took her flight towards the mill, vociferating mo&s;t incontinently by the way, till &s;he had called out the miller's dog, who &s;allied forth in her defence with all po&s;&s;ible alacrity, bri&s;tling every hair with ardour for revenge, and ru&s;hing to the ford, where the flouncing and da&s;hing of the water directed him to the &s;cene of action. Without a moment's he&s;itation, this amphibious animal plunged into the &s;tream, at the very moment when Zachary's fate hung upon the balance, and the nymph of the brook was preparing to receive him in her arms. His head, according to the principles of ac|tion and reaction of ela&s;tic bodies, had taken a tour through the &s;egment of a parabola, and was now in its declination towards the crupper of old Betty, when the avenger of the duck &s;eized the &s;kirt of his coat, and &s;pite of all
<PB N="22" REF="28">
impediments, which &s;taytape and buckram could oppo&s;e to his gripe, took &s;o fa&s;t a hold, and gave the luckle&s;s Accoucheur &s;o hearty a tug in the cri&s;is of vacillation, that he came backwards into the pool&mdash;and terrible was the fall thereof.</P>
<P>The dog kept his hold, and Zachary, who was bodily immer&s;ed in the pool, had &s;wal|lowed more of that beverage at a draught than had &s;erved him for a twelve-month be|fore; &s;o that had he kept his pre&s;ent quarters but a few moments longer, he might have &s;et the Humane Society and all its experiments at defiance; and <HI>the child that is unborn</HI> might have <HI>rued</HI> the woeful event of this day: when Fortune, or more probably the tutelary godde&s;s <HI>Lucina,</HI> &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger to his re&s;cue, in the per&s;on of Henry, who had no &s;ooner redeem|ed hat and wig, tho&s;e ornaments of his per|&s;on, from the cogs of the mill-wheel, than he flew to &s;natch their principal from the teeth of the ma&s;tiff. Having &s;et his ma&s;ter on his legs, the valorous youth in&s;tantly &s;eized the furious animal by the throat, and griped him with &s;o &s;trong a hand, that at length he threw him, with lolling tongue and eyes rolling in death, breathle&s;s on the bank; he then re|turned
<PB N="23" REF="29">
to tender his further &s;ervices to poor Zachary, who pre&s;ented a mo&s;t piteous &s;pec|tacle, in his cinnamon-coloured &s;uit, alas! how changed, with every pocket full of water, his bald pate covered with duck weed, drip|ping down his &s;houlders, being in caricature the very model of a Dutch river-god: upon the &s;hore lay his flaxen perriwig, a melancholy wreck, and be&s;ide it old Betty, the origin of all evil, brow&s;ing in&s;en&s;ibly on the bank, as if nothing had happened, and regardle&s;s of all other concerns than what affected her&s;elf.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IV. Strength is overthrown by Skill.</HEAD>
<P>IT was happy for the Doctor, in his pre&s;ent plight, that he had a hou&s;e of refuge to near at hand: the miller, Thomas Weevil by name, no &s;ooner heard of his misfortune, than both he and his dame &s;allied forth, to tender him all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance needful in his di&s;tre&s;s. Dry cloaths and fre&s;h linen were in&s;tantly pro|vided, and all the rights of ho&s;pitality duly performed by the ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s of the family, who neglected nothing that could &s;hew
<PB N="24" REF="30">
their good will and gratitude for pa&s;t &s;ervices, Zachary having been the happy in&s;trument of u&s;hering eight &s;turdy bantlings into the world, in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, without a &s;ingle &s;lip or mi&s;carriage by the way.</P>
<P>The elde&s;t of this groupe, a &s;turdy youth about the age of Henry, had left his father to do the honours of the hou&s;e to the Doctor, whil&s;t he was applying him&s;elf to the recovering of his favourite dog. When all the efforts which his art could &s;ugge&s;t proved fruitle&s;s, with rage and di&s;appointment equally inflamed, he turned furiou&s;ly upon the author of his cala|mity, and &s;eizing him by the collar, &s;wore vehemently to be revenged: a &s;truggle en|&s;ued, the young miller &s;triving to drag Henry towards the water, with an intent, no doubt, to make atonement to the manes of his canine friend, in the very &s;pot where he met his death.</P>
<P>Henry, who had command over his temper, and only &s;ought to pacify the anger of his a&s;|&s;ailant, oppo&s;ed him&s;elf with calmne&s;s to the attack, expo&s;tulating meanwhile on the inju&s;|tice of a&s;&s;aulting him, for what it was his duty to do in defence of a fellow-creature; and very properly demanding, if the life of a Chri&s;tian
<PB N="25" REF="31">
was not of more value than the life of a dog? Young Weevil, who was not at lei&s;ure to lend a patient ear to arguments of this &s;ort, and who probably a&s;cribed the coolne&s;s of the dog|&s;layer to the wrong motive, &s;eemed only to gather fre&s;h re&s;entment by what ought to have appea&s;ed it, and now redoubled his attack with &s;uch fury, that our hero found it high time to re&s;ort to other defences than words; and having, by a &s;udden jerk, extricated him|&s;elf from the gra&s;p of the enraged aggre&s;&s;or, &s;eized him in return, and having the advantage in &s;kill as well as agility, kicked up his heels, and, pitching him flat upon his back, com|mitted him with &s;o good a will to his mother earth, that if the emblem of man's life is but du&s;t and a&s;hes, it was never more &s;trikingly exemplified, than in the cloud which now a&s;cended from the mealy frock of the pro&s;trate miller. Stunned by his fall, and extended at his length, the champion and his dog lay &s;ide by &s;ide, till Henry, who did not wi&s;h to have more lives than one to an&s;wer for, began to fear they meant to keep company together to the &s;hades of death: a few moments how|ever relieved him from that anxiety, when the fallen combatant, getting upon his legs

and giving him&s;elf a &s;hake, by way of enquiry if all was right and in its place, &s;urveying the per&s;on of his conqueror from heel to head, as if he had been taking mea&s;ure of a meal|&s;ack, and &s;pying there no bones or &s;inews, which he was not con&s;cious of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing in greater outward proportion him&s;elf, vocife|rated in a furious tone, that he was a cowardly ra&s;cal, and no fair fighter; adding, with a hearty oath, <Q REND="inline">"Bar tripping, and I'll box you for a crown."</Q></P>
<P>Henry calmly replied, <Q REND="inline">"That what he had done was in &s;elf-defence, and not with an in|tent to hurt him, which he was glad to &s;ee was not the ca&s;e; therefore"</Q> added he, <Q REND="inline">"be &s;a|tisfied with what you have got, and don't pro|voke a wor&s;e mi&s;chance, by compelling me to handle you after another fa&s;hion."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"You are a &s;neaking puppy,"</Q> cried the miller, <Q REND="inline">"and no man; all your play lies in your heels: but I'll make you take to them in another gue&s;s manner, before I quit you; if I had you in a ring, &s;irrah, I'd <HI>make a frog of you</HI> in half a dozen rounds, &s;o I wou'd; I'd maul you like a raggamuffin as you are."</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"You lie!"</Q> retorted the clown, who had again mi&s;con&s;trued the calmne&s;s of his antago|ni&s;t, <Q REND="inline">"there is no end of it, and I'll &s;hake hands with no &s;uch &s;hirker as you are. I tell you once again, bar tripping, and I'll box it fairly out with you to-morrow noon, upon the Town Green, foot to foot; and becau&s;e I know you for a &s;hy cock, and a trick&s;ter at the game, I'll have no tumbler's play; neither party &s;hall drop without a knock-down blow; &s;o here's my crown upon the battle, if you are worth &s;o much, if not I'll fight you for love, and give you a belly-full for nothing: there's an end of the matter, I am your man&mdash;&s;trike hands with me if you dare."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If I dare!"</Q> replied Henry; <Q REND="inline">"don't mi&s;take me for a coward, becau&s;e I am not a bully. I am not afraid of my own ri&s;que, but I have no quarrel with you, and be&s;ides that have no money to &s;take again&s;t your's. As for the Town Green, I know not where it is, for I

never was in the place I am going to: I am a perfect &s;tranger in the&s;e parts, and had ra|ther live in peace with you as a neighbour, than turn out again&s;t you for a trifling object, that is not worth wrangling about.

out of the citadel. A gracious nod, which he be&s;towed on Henry, gave him to under|&s;tand that his &s;ervices were well received; but when old Betty pre&s;ented her&s;elf at the door, led thither by one of the younger fry of the mill, darting a reproachful glance upon her, he exclaimed&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Oh! thou bitch of Ba|bylon! is it thus thou &s;erve&s;t me after all my kindne&s;s? Could'&s;t thou not be content to &s;will that paunch of thine in peace, but thou mu&s;t fri&s;k and frolic in thy cups, till thou had'&s;t tumbled me into the &s;tream, at the peril of my life?

<P>This denunciation ended, and no other an|&s;wer returned but a grunt from old Betty as her ponderous jockey &s;eated him&s;elf in the &s;addle, Zachary &s;hook hands with the ho&s;pi|table miller, and putting him&s;elf under an ea&s;y &s;ail, &s;teered for the harbour of his own man&s;ion in the neighbouring village.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he got out of ear-&s;hot of the miller, he began to vent his bile again&s;t the whole race of dogs and ducks, heartily con|&s;igning
<PB N="30" REF="36">
them to the devil and his dam. He next proceeded to vindicate his own talent for hor&s;eman&s;hip, in which he roundly a&s;&s;erted no man ever exceeded him; and then turning to Henry, who was clo&s;e at his &s;tirrup, he re|&s;umed his natural good-humour, and, with many commendations of his courage and ad|dre&s;s, drew forth a guinea, and, forcing it into his hand, bade him take it as a &s;mall gratuity for a great &s;ervice, and as an earne&s;t of future favours; <Q REND="inline">"Which,"</Q> added he, <Q REND="inline">"if you go on as you have begun, you will richly merit. Some difficulties, however, you will have to encounter in my family, and it be|hoves me to caution you again&s;t them: there is a lady at home, whom I have not found it very ea&s;y to live with, neither will you; Mrs. Caw|dle has a few con&s;titutional failings, that are rather trouble&s;ome to deal with; a great am|bition to be thought a &s;aint, and a &s;trong pro|pen&s;ity to make her&s;elf a bea&s;t; in other words, &s;he will cant and tipple from noon till night. Now there is another pa&s;&s;ion, con|comitant of enthu&s;ia&s;m and inebriety, which I forbear to mention, though it is exactly that, Henry, which I think you are mo&s;t likely to be hampered with: I &s;hall only hint to you
<PB N="31" REF="37">
that the &s;aints are very loving in their cups; and rea&s;on enough why they &s;hould, as in that ca&s;e they are quickened by a double do&s;e of the &s;pirit. You are a comely lad, have a care, therefore, that your fle&s;h don't catch fire when her &s;pirit begins to flame. Among&s;t the many accompli&s;hments you enumerated to me, p&s;alm-&s;inging, if I well remember, was one: you may &s;afely confide that talent to my &s;ecrecy, for I never wi&s;h to hear a &s;ingle &s;tave of Sternhold or Hopkins while I live; but if you breathe a word of it to my Jemima, farewell to your lungs, depend on it &s;he will make you tune your pipe to &s;ome purpo&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>More would have en&s;ued, for Zachary was now in the communicative vein, when old Betty came to a full &s;top; and Henry, look|ing up, perceived a neat brick hou&s;e within a court, the gate of which was flanked by two &s;tone piers, emblematically crowned with gally|pots, or, as a virtuo&s;o would have &s;tiled them, cineral urns, &s;upporting a &s;croll, carried in an arch from one to the other, on which was di&s;|played, in letters of gold, upon a bright blue ground, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Zachary Cawdle, Surgeon, Apothe|cary, and Man Midwife.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>An old woman pre&s;ented her&s;elf at the gate,
<PB N="32" REF="38">
and led the mare to the &s;table, followed by Henry, who mode&s;tly conte&s;ted with her the prerogative of the bridle, but to no purpo&s;e. Zachary entered the hou&s;e; and having peeped into the parlour, where he de&s;cried his beloved in her ea&s;y chair fa&s;t a&s;leep, drew his conclu|&s;ions, and quietly retired to his chamber.</P>
<P>Mrs. Jemima Cawdle, the &s;pou&s;e of Za|chary, was a comely, corpulent lady, of about forty years of age, and had pa&s;s'd the be&s;t part of her youth in the capacity of hou&s;e-keeper to a wealthy baronet, who died a bachelor, and from who&s;e bounty &s;he enjoyed an annuity of two hundred pounds, bequeathed to her in recompence for her long and faithful &s;ervices.

<P>It cannot be di&s;gui&s;ed that Public Fame, who is too apt to bu&s;y her&s;elf about other peo|ple's affairs, circulated an idle in&s;inuation that Doctor Zachary had been &s;erviceable to this lady on a former occa&s;ion, in relieving her from an indi&s;po&s;ition, with which &s;he had been annoyed for the &s;pace of eight or nine months, and for which his art found a cure in the very cri&s;is of her di&s;temper; but not to dwell any longer on the&s;e &s;illy rumours, which are below the dig|nity of this hi&s;tory, &s;uffice it to ob&s;erve, that Mrs. Jemima did not come empty handed to the Doctor, and that, fully con&s;cious of this, &s;he had too much &s;en&s;e of her own dignity to give up her right and title for indulging her|&s;elf in tho&s;e innocent habits and recreations
<PB N="34" REF="40">
which &s;he had been accu&s;tomed to in her &s;tate of celibacy, particularly that of applying to a certain &s;pecific again&s;t qualms and tremors, which &s;he kept at hand, within the precincts of her own clo&s;et; and though the &s;aid &s;peci|fic was not a medicine to be found upon Za|chary's file, nor what perhaps he would have taken on him&s;elf to recommend, yet long practice had &s;o reconciled her to the u&s;e of it, that her con&s;titution &s;eemed now to call for it, and I cannot doubt but &s;he had &s;trong rea&s;ons for preferring it to every thing the <HI>Materia Me|dica</HI> could offer in its &s;tead.</P>
<P>Now it &s;o chanced that Mrs. Cawdle, in her &s;pou&s;e's ab&s;ence, had cheared her heart with a comforting portion of this &s;pecific, and in the moment of her good man's arrival was, by the operation of the afore&s;aid do&s;e, fa&s;t locked in the arms of <HI>Somnus.</HI> All this was perfectly intelligible to Zachary at the fir&s;t glance, who thereupon contentedly betook him&s;elf to his cabin, like a Dutchman when he &s;mells a &s;torm, and quietly turned into his &s;olitary crib, a re&s;ource which he kept in petto for the&s;e and other occa&s;ions incidental to his pro|fe&s;&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VI. A Saint not &s;ober.</HEAD>
<P>THE dome&s;tics of the family, into which Henry had now entered, con&s;i&s;ted of an antient matron, Bridget by name, who offi|ciated in the kitchen, and Su&s;an May, daughter of a widow woman, an inhabitant of the vil|lage, who waited upon the per&s;on of Mrs. Cawdle. Doctor Zachary had recommended Henry &s;o &s;trongly to the care and good graces of the&s;e kind creatures, that they received him very courteou&s;ly, and did the honours of the kitchen with much ho&s;pitality. Bridget had recollected a cold gammon of bacon, that was &s;tanding idle in the cupboard, and Su&s;an had put a fre&s;h faggot on the fire, where &s;he was boiling the water for her mi&s;tre&s;s's tea. By the light of a chearful blaze &s;he had now an opportunity of reconnoitring the young &s;tranger with more accuracy than hitherto &s;he had been able to do; when, having &s;canned him over with an eye that betokened &s;ome|thing more than pity, gently &s;troking her hand
<PB N="36" REF="42">
over his head, &s;he gave a &s;igh, and &s;aid&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Alas! poor fellow, thou art cold and hun|gry, I'll engage for thee;"</Q>&mdash;and then pro|ceeded to other que&s;tions, which Henry ei|ther an&s;wered or evaded, as he thought fit. She now filled out a ba&s;on of tea, and repaired with it to her mi&s;tre&s;s in the parlour.</P>
<P>Su&s;an, who was not bred in the &s;chool of Harpocrates, waked her mi&s;tre&s;s from her &s;lumbers, by the noi&s;e &s;he made upon enter|ing the room; whereupon Jemima acco&s;ted her as follows,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Why, what the devil, wench, will you never be taught to open a door &s;oftly? Do you con&s;ider, mawkin, the wretched &s;tate of my poor tortur'd nerves, trembling, quivering, tingling all over me, at every &s;hock you give them? Do you &s;ee the quandary you have thrown me into? Then you tread as heavy as a cart-hor&s;e, and bawl &s;o loud, that my brain &s;plits with every word you &s;peak."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"But I have not &s;poken a word yet,"</Q> cried Su&s;an; <Q REND="inline">"and here's your tea, &s;o pray drink it, and compo&s;e your&s;elf."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Com|po&s;e my&s;elf, child!"</Q> replied the mi&s;tre&s;s in a &s;ofter tone; <Q REND="inline">"I don't expect I &s;hall compo&s;e my&s;elf &s;ufficiently this night to be able to reach my bed-room without help; I perceive
<PB N="37" REF="43">
I am relap&s;ing into my old tremors. Mercy upon me, how my hand &s;hakes! Indeed and indeed, my good girl, you mu&s;t be cautious not to flutter me when I am in this way."</Q></P>
<P>She now took the tea, and whil&s;t &s;he was &s;ipping it, her waiting-woman began to tell her about the Doctor's accident, and how he was re&s;cued from the teeth of the miller's dog, which in Su&s;an's narrative made as tre|mendous a figure as an Aby&s;&s;inian hyaena: that good-natured girl having coloured her de|&s;cription of her ma&s;ter's danger to the height, that &s;he might &s;et off the heroi&s;m of Henry to the greater advantage.</P>
<P>The &s;edative beverage having in &s;ome de|gree allayed the trembling of Jemima's nerves, &s;he made many pious apo&s;trophes upon the Doctor's e&s;cape, which &s;he hoped would be a warning call upon him to repentance, and a better life: &s;he bewailed the reprobate &s;tate he was in; and candidly ob&s;erved, that as he led the life of a heathen, &s;he &s;hould not have been &s;urprized, had he peri&s;hed by the teeth of a dog. In the mean time, &s;he hinted her a&s;toni&s;hment in pretty &s;trong terms, that he could have the a&s;&s;urance to bring a &s;trange fellow into her family, picked up at random,
<PB N="38" REF="44">
without con&s;ulting her opinion and approba|tion in the fir&s;t place. To this Su&s;an replied, <Q REND="inline">"A &s;trange fellow, do you call him, Madam! You would not &s;ay &s;o, if you &s;aw him; not|with&s;tanding his poor apparel, I'll be further if he is not a gentleman born; aye, and the hand&s;ome&s;t in my opinion that ever I &s;et eyes on."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"What tell you me of hand&s;ome,"</Q> ex|claimed the mi&s;tre&s;s; <Q REND="inline">"is he holy, humble, devout?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"He was wet and hungry,"</Q> re|plied Su&s;an, <Q REND="inline">"&s;o we warmed him and fed him, that's all I know of the matter; as for the re&s;t, its no concern of mine: I only did by him as I would be done by in the like ca&s;e."</Q> This &s;aid, Su&s;an left the room without waiting for an an&s;wer.</P>
<P>This good lady, who properly put &s;o high a value upon the piety of a &s;ervant, and &s;o &s;light an one upon his per&s;on, had in times pa&s;t led a cour&s;e of life not perfectly recon|cileable to the rules and doctrines of that re|ligion, which is preached by the mini&s;ters of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church; and being naturally indi&s;po&s;ed to hear of failings, which it was in|convenient to her to di&s;mi&s;s and repent of, &s;he determined no longer to be annoyed with their &s;ermons and exhortations, and, &s;triking out of
<PB N="39" REF="45">
the regular road, took a &s;horter cour&s;e for quieting her con&s;cience, without di&s;turbing her enjoyments. By this new method of com|pounding for defaults in practice, through the help of a &s;trong imagination and a glowing enthu&s;ia&s;m, Jemima had fairly brought all pa&s;t reckonings to a balance, and at the &s;ame time kept a mental &s;alvo in re&s;erve again&s;t future ones. She was correct in all &s;mall matters of form, regular at her love-fea&s;ts, dealt the ki&s;s of peace with a &s;ervency mo&s;t edifying, wa&s;hed the dirty feet of the brethren, had a pious reverence for &s;alt, and as zealous a dete&s;|tation for blood-puddings as any &s;aint in the &s;ect, of which &s;he &s;tood forth a bright and &s;hining example, profe&s;&s;ing to believe every my&s;tery of the Chri&s;tian faith, and fulfilling no one moral duty, which the Scriptures teach.</P>
<P>She was now exactly in that &s;tate of fermen|tation, when the &s;pirit was mo&s;t apt to boil over; and having under&s;tood ju&s;t &s;o much from Su&s;an's report of Henry's youth and &s;implicity, as &s;ugge&s;ted to her an occa&s;ion for making a di&s;play of her zeal, &s;he began to arrange her thoughts in the be&s;t order &s;he could for the undertaking. Having thrown her&s;elf back in her chair, and &s;hut her eyes to
<PB N="40" REF="46">
a&s;&s;i&s;t meditation, &s;he had nearly fallen into another doze from the &s;oporific effects of in|ten&s;e thinking, when having rai&s;ed her&s;elf up|right in her &s;eat, and being &s;eized at the mo|ment with a &s;wimming in her head by the &s;ud|denne&s;s of the motion a huge pyramid of gauze, which by her late recumbent po&s;ture was thru&s;t forward out of its place, came in contact with the candle, and immediately caught fire. Her &s;creams in one in&s;tant brought Henry to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, who &s;o nimbly re&s;cued her from her danger, that her cap was off and extingui&s;hed before one hair of her head had been &s;inged by the flame.</P>
<P>When her terror had &s;ub&s;ided, Mrs. Cawdle ca&s;t her eyes upon the per&s;on of her deliverer. The alarm had perfectly di&s;&s;ipated her &s;omno|lency, and in great part even the cau&s;e of it. The ideas, that had floated in her brain, and on which &s;he had been pondering, lo&s;t hold of her imagination, and enthu&s;ia&s;m began to give way to impre&s;&s;ions of a different &s;ort: &s;he had no longer any wi&s;h to make a &s;aint of one, who &s;eemed to her already to be an angel. As the traveller, who&s;e eye has been jaded with long dwelling on the loath&s;ome fens of E&s;&s;ex, feels un&s;peakable recreation when, having cro&s;&s;ed

the Thames, he mounts the beautiful hills of Kent, and thence contemplates nature in her faire&s;t &s;hape&mdash;&s;uch was the delightful &s;en&s;ation Jemima now experienced, whil&s;t &s;he gazed upon Henry, and compared his animated and graceful form with the li&s;tle&s;s and mi&s;hapen lump, that the fat partner of her heart pre|&s;ented daily and hourly to her weary &s;ight. He had his hand upon the door, &s;o that no time was to be lo&s;t, when, with an eager accent, &s;he called out to him to &s;top; then bidding him &s;hut the door, &s;he began as follows:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are the young per&s;on, I pre&s;ume, whom the Doctor has taken into his family, and your name is Henry: you give a good &s;ample of your &s;ervices, Henry, not only in the care you had of your wetched ma&s;ter in his fall, but no le&s;s &s;o in the attention you have now &s;hewn to me in my alarm; in &s;hort, between fire and water, you have been fully em|ployed this day in the re&s;cue of us both in our turns, and you well de&s;erve to be rewarded for your performances."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am amply rewarded,"</Q> replied Henry, <Q REND="inline">"by your kind acceptance of my duty in the fir&s;t place, and next by my ma&s;ter's liberality, who gave me as much as I have occa&s;ion
<PB N="42" REF="48">
for, and more than I had any right to ex|pect."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Your ma&s;ter, indeed!"</Q> cried Jemima; <Q REND="inline">"your ma&s;ter knows neither how to rate your &s;ervices, nor to reward you for them; I'll en|gage he has hir'd you for no other purpo&s;e bur to beat the filthy mortar, and do the dirty work in his dirty &s;hop: but you &s;hall do no &s;uch thing; you &s;hall wait upon me; I will take you to my&s;elf. With me your work will be ea&s;y and your life happy, with him you will be a drudge and the lacquey of a drudge; for his very &s;hopman, the old Highlander, will make you fetch and carry on his &s;crubby er|rands: from me you will hear none but pious and edifying conver&s;ation; from them nothing but balderda&s;h and bla&s;phemy in an outlandi&s;h dialect: of me you will gain good in&s;truction; they will lead you to your ruin, and render you in the end, what they are them&s;elves, lo&s;t &s;ouls in a &s;tate of reprobation, and totally ca&s;t out from the lot of the righteous."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Heaven forbid!"</Q> quoth Henry.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Don't &s;ay &s;o, don't &s;ay &s;o,"</Q> re&s;umed the &s;aint; <Q REND="inline">"don't &s;hock my ears with a &s;ingle word in their fa|vour: true zeal feels no pity for the wicked."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not pity them!"</Q> exclaim'd the youth
<PB N="43" REF="49">
with eagerne&s;s; <Q REND="inline">"I could almo&s;t find in my heart to pity the devil him&s;elf."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"The devil you cou'd!"</Q> cried the &s;aint, with horror in her countenance; <Q REND="inline">"from what part of the world are you come? who are your unhappy parents? and in what anti-chri&s;tian principles have you been educated? Pity them, indeed! No, no, that were a &s;in as heinous as what they com|mit; but the elect cannot &s;in, and con&s;equently have no pity for &s;inners."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I beg pardon for my boldne&s;s, Madam,"</Q> replied Henry, <Q REND="inline">"but if this be &s;o, I mu&s;t take leave to di&s;&s;ent from the elect."</Q>&mdash;This &s;aid, he quitted the room, and left the inebriated zealot to dige&s;t his doc|trine as &s;he could.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VII. A timely Re&s;cue.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning Henry aro&s;e with the lark, and finding nobody &s;tirring within doors, went in to the garden, and there began to employ him&s;elf in reforming the borders, that were in a very neglected condition. Whil&s;t he was thus occupied, he ob&s;erved a tall &s;tout man, who&s;e &s;waggering gait and important air
<PB N="44" REF="50">
be&s;poke him a per&s;on of &s;ome authority, com|ing acro&s;s the adjoining field, and making directly for a little wicket in the garden hedge, that communicated with the &s;aid field. Here he was no &s;ooner arrived than, di&s;covering Henry, he &s;topt &s;hort, and in an angry tone demanded&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Who are you, Sir, and why are you at work in this garden?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e I am &s;ervant to the owner of it,"</Q> Henry replied, <Q REND="inline">"and have nothing el&s;e ju&s;t now to employ my&s;elf about."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"If you are &s;ervant to the owner,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"betake your&s;elf to his &s;hop, and tell Kinloch to &s;end the medicines to my hou&s;e, that are ordered to be made up."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"And to who&s;e direction mu&s;t they be ad|dre&s;&s;ed?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"My name is Blachford; you mu&s;t be new in the&s;e parts, not to know me."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I am a &s;tranger, it is true, in this place,"</Q> rejoined Henry, <Q REND="inline">"and have not the honour of knowing you, but I &s;hall obey your com|mands."</Q></P>
<P>After a few minutes Henry, finding nobody up in the hou&s;e, and the &s;hop-door locked, re|turned to make report to his &s;ender, who was now &s;tanding clo&s;e under the eaves, in earne&s;t conver&s;ation, as it &s;eemed, with &s;omebody at a window: the ca&s;ement was quickly &s;hut upon
<PB N="45" REF="51">
his appearance, but not &s;o nimbly as to pre|vent his di&s;covering to a certainty that Su&s;an was the party to whom Blachford's conver&s;a|tion was addre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The look, that gentleman now be&s;towed upon Henry, gave him &s;ufficiently to under|&s;tand how unwelcome his company was; and before he could well explain the rea&s;on of his &s;udden return, Blachford's rage had bur&s;t forth both in words and actions, &s;o far at lea&s;t as his courage &s;uffered him to proceed, by brandi&s;h|ing his cane in a threatening manner, and tell|ing him to be gone from his &s;ight, for he per|ceived he was a very impertinent prying fel|low, and would have nothing to &s;ay to him, <Q REND="inline">"And depend upon it,"</Q> added he, <Q REND="inline">"I will have my eye upon you; if I catch you tripping, and once lay my hands upon you, you &s;han't ea&s;ily get out of them."</Q></P>
<P>With the&s;e words, which Henry an&s;wered only with a look of firm undaunted innocence, Blachford &s;trode away, and was &s;oon out of &s;ight: the ca&s;ement was then opened, and Su&s;an in a low voice de&s;ired him to come into the hou&s;e, for &s;he wanted to &s;peak to him: as &s;oon as they met, &s;he began with &s;ome degree of embarra&s;&s;ment to apologize for appearances.
<PB N="46" REF="52">
She told him Mr. Blachford was a very rich gentleman, lived in a hand&s;ome hou&s;e near at hand, and was very kind to her mother, an aged widow, who inhabited a &s;mall cottage clo&s;e to his gate; that the occa&s;ion of her &s;peaking to him from the window, was &s;imply to thank him for &s;ome favours he had be&s;towed upon her mother; &s;he hoped that Henry had &s;aid nothing to give him offence, for that he was a proud man, and would not put up with an affront from any body, much le&s;s from his inferiors: moreover he was a ju&s;tice of peace, and dealt &s;o rigidly with tho&s;e that came under his hands, that all the pari&s;h and neighbour|hood round about &s;tood in fear and terror of him.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He may be a ju&s;tice,"</Q> replied Henry, <Q REND="inline">"but I'll take upon me to &s;ay he is not a gentleman. As to his bu&s;ine&s;s with you, Su&s;an, or your's with him, tru&s;t me I am not curious to be informed of it: it was mere chance and accident threw me in the way to interrupt it, which if I have done to your detriment or regret, I am heartily &s;orry for it. As for his blu&s;tering and threatening, I fear him not, neither did I provoke him by any language improper for me to make u&s;e of to a per&s;on
<PB N="47" REF="53">
of his &s;ort; I was as humble towards him, as becomes any one human creature to be to another in the like circum&s;tances. I re&s;pect him, however, for being kind to your mother; I only hope it is pure kindne&s;s, and that he does not look for it to be repaid by any &s;acrifices from you: whil&s;t you make no other acknow|ledgments than you can convey to him from a window, all will be well."</Q></P>
<P>This was pointed with a certain expre&s;&s;ion of look and accent, that brought the blu&s;hes into Su&s;an's cheeks. She hoped &s;he could not be &s;u&s;pected of favouring &s;uch a great, black, ugly thing as his wor&s;hip, and an old fellow into the bargain; &s;he tru&s;ted &s;he under|&s;tood her&s;elf better, than to give her company where &s;he could not be&s;tow her liking; in &s;aying which, &s;he conveyed a glance to Henry's eyes, which &s;implicity it&s;elf could not fail to decypher, and nothing le&s;s than predetermined virtue could be able to encounter; for, with|out attempting de&s;criptions, which we do not wi&s;h to engage in, we de&s;ire the reader to take it on our word, that the afore&s;aid Su&s;an May, in form and feature, was po&s;itively one of the mo&s;t dangerous objects, that &s;trong pa&s;|&s;ion and weak re&s;olution could po&s;&s;ibly come
<PB N="48" REF="54">
in contact with; &s;he had health, youth and beauty to allure de&s;ire, and tell-tale eyes, that threw out &s;ignals of encouragement to hope.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Upon my word, Henry,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"you are very con&s;iderate of my reputation, which is more than I &s;hould have expected from a hand&s;ome young fellow like you, who I dare &s;ay have &s;ly &s;ins enough of your own to an|&s;wer for; but, to tell you the truth in one word, there is not a being upon earth I &s;o abominate as that &s;urly brute Ju&s;tice Blach|ford: I believe he is as ba&s;e in heart as he is black in per&s;on; therefore, with your leave, we will put him a&s;ide, and talk of &s;omething that is more to the purpo&s;e. What have you done to my drunken dame, I would fain know, that has &s;et her in &s;uch a tantarum? There was &s;he, foaming and fretting after you had been with her, like a mad thing: &s;urely you did not put on that preaching face to her, as you did ju&s;t now to me: you'll never have a moment's quiet in this hou&s;e, if you don't keep well with the tip&s;ey &s;hrew that rules it: &s;he'll ferret you out in a twink|ling, take my word for it, if you thwart her, and it is not the Doctor that can &s;ave you; but if you'll coax and humour her, you may
<PB N="49" REF="55">
pa&s;s your time to your heart's content; and for my &s;hare, &s;hort as our acquaintance has been, &s;o much am I prejudiced in your fa|vour, that as far as I can contribute to your happine&s;s, be a&s;&s;ured nothing in my power &s;hall be wanting to make your life plea&s;ant whil&s;t we are together."</Q></P>
<P>It was a look, a &s;mile, a gentle pre&s;&s;ure of his hand in her's, whil&s;t &s;he uttered the&s;e words, that gave them a grace and energy, which but for the&s;e accompaniments had not belonged to them; Su&s;an, though not elo|quent, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the orator's be&s;t attribute in an eminent degree; in her action &s;he was ir|re&s;i&s;tible. I know not whether I am to call it Henry's good or evil genius, that now ap|peared in the per&s;on of old Bridget, to draw him off to his ma&s;ter in his bed-chamber. He had begun a &s;tammering kind of acknow|ledgment to Su&s;an, that meant to convey &s;omething between courte&s;y and caution, but expre&s;&s;ed neither one nor the other di&s;tinctly, when the plea of duty helped him out of the dilemma for this turn, but left a memento be|hind it, plainly intimating that flight was his be&s;t defence again&s;t &s;uch weapons as nature had be&s;towed on Su&s;an: &s;he in the mean time
<PB N="50" REF="56">
was not &s;low to di&s;cover, both where his weak|ne&s;s lay, and in what her own &s;trength con|&s;i&s;ted; what he could not term a victory on his part, &s;he had no right to con&s;ider as a defeat on her's: chance had broken up the conference; opportunity could not be want|ing to renew it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VIII. A &s;udden Attack upon an unguarded Con&s;cience.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Henry entered the Doctor's chamber, he found him &s;till between the blankets, where he had provoked &s;o copi|ous a per&s;piration, that there is little doubt but he had paid intere&s;t through his pores for every drop of water he had borrowed by his throat in his rencounter with the duck. In&s;tead of giving a &s;trait an&s;wer to Henry's enquiries, he began to hold forth a learned lecture, upon the u&s;e and efficacy of &s;udori|fics, reprobating in the &s;tronge&s;t terms the vulgar error of pouring in hot liquors upon cold &s;tomachs, which he pronounced to be a diabolical practice, and little better than &s;low poi&s;on, ju&s;t then forgetting the gla&s;s of

In the cour&s;e of this harangue, he in&s;tanced the bad habit of Mi&s;|tre&s;s Cawdle as a ca&s;e in point, who he roundly a&s;&s;erted was dramming her&s;elf out of the world; adding, with an oath, that if Jemima was a &s;aint, he would be bold to &s;ay &s;he was the mo&s;t drunken &s;aint in the calendar.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erving that Henry made no reply to this, except by a &s;ignificant &s;hake of his head, he added&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Well, well, you are a di&s;creet lad, I perceive, and know how to hold your tongue upon occa&s;ion, but I'll bett a good wager &s;he has been preaching to you over her cups: it is always the ca&s;e when the &s;pirit flies up into her head; but don't let her make a fool of you; one &s;aint in a family is one too many: mind your bu&s;ine&s;s, ply the mortar, and leave religion to tho&s;e who get their living by it: you and I, my lad, have &s;omething el&s;e to think of."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I hope,"</Q> replied Henry, <Q REND="inline">"I can mind my bu&s;ine&s;s without neglecting my religion."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Hark-ye, child,"</Q> cried Zachary, <Q REND="inline">"you talk like an ignoramus, if you &s;uppo&s;e that we of the faculty can have any other religion than to take care of the health and con&s;titu|tions of our patients. Every man in his own

<P><Q REND="inline">"Far be it from me,"</Q> replied Henry, <Q REND="inline">"to offer at any compari&s;on between profe&s;&s;ions, which I cannot pretend to judge of; but as I pre&s;ume a good Chri&s;tian is the greate&s;t cha|racter a man can have, I humbly conceive a good and faithful mini&s;ter of God's word to be no man's inferior."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Be that as it may,"</Q> rejoined Zachary, <Q REND="inline">"I have had the handling of their carca&s;es in my time, and have found &s;ome rotten wethers among&s;t the flock, that would hardly bear the touch: but I perceive, young man, you have got a twang of the conventicle about you, and will

<P>I believe I have already hinted that Zachary was &s;omewhat inclined to the ira&s;cible, and as he had now &s;tarted a topic that was apt to give certain twitches to his con&s;cience, which were not over plea&s;ant in their operation, he had flounced and floundered about at &s;uch a rate in his bed, whil&s;t this bu&s;y intermeddler was at work, that he had by this time effectu|ally repelled the per&s;piration, and began to be &s;en&s;ible of certain &s;ymptomatic innuendoes, that argued an intention in Nature to make a &s;ud|den turn from hot to cold, and in one of her freaks and fits of variety treat him with a ta&s;te of the other extreme. His teeth now began to make mu&s;ic, his &s;pirits &s;unk, and he huddled up his head in the bed-cloaths, &s;ighing from the bottom of his heart, as well knowing by the

tuning of the in&s;truments before-hand what the full concert would be when it &s;truck up in earne&s;t.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The Lord have mercy upon me!"</Q> ex|claimed poor Zachary, <Q REND="inline">"what is going for|ward now?

I know my own con&s;titution to a tittle; I'm a plethoric man, the wor&s;t &s;ubject in nature for an ague and fever: <HI>Doctor Doublechin</HI> went out of the world in the &s;ame way, he took a &s;hort leave and was off; 'tis a lo&s;t ca&s;e, Henry, 'tis all up with your poor ma&s;ter, if I can't drive the foe out of one door or the other before he gets footing in the hou&s;e. For the love of Heaven, put your hand in my wai&s;tcoat pocket, and give me a &s;mall paper in a blue wrapper, which you'll find there; it contains a medicine which I never admini&s;ter to my patients, be|cau&s;e I &s;corn to go out of the regular practice with my friends, but when a man's own life is at &s;take, there is no joke in dallying: <HI>Doctor James</HI> mu&s;t do the jobb, or I mu&s;t beat a ha&s;ty march out of this world, and be gone."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="62">Henry gave him the paper and &s;ome warm liquid, in which he mixed the life-re&s;toring do&s;e and &s;wallowed it, giving order for &s;ome barley-water to be made, and other fit prepa|rations for its operation.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had his attendant left the cham|ber than Zachary, now alone and at lei&s;ure for meditation, began to entertain &s;erious ap|prehen&s;ions for the con&s;equences of this &s;ud|den attack. The rapid progre&s;s of a &s;ever in better con&s;titutions than his own he had fre|quently been a witne&s;s to: it was an enemy who&s;e &s;trength he had fully experienced, hav|ing baffled him over and over; death was a con&s;ummation, which in his own ca&s;e was de|voutly to be dreaded, though he could con|template it with all due &s;erenity in the ca&s;e of others; the flippant and contemptuous &s;tile, in which he had ju&s;t then been talking of the du|ties of religion, recoiled upon his thoughts &s;o &s;trongly, that his pre&s;ent &s;udden and unex|pected attack &s;truck his con&s;cience as a judg|ment, and mo&s;t heartily did he wi&s;h he could recall what he had been &s;aying to Henry: in the mean time the cold fit &s;hook him wor&s;e and wor&s;e, whil&s;t the active medicine ran through his veins with awful omens of a cri&s;is

coming on: he knew too well that the battle between Death and him mu&s;t be a clo&s;e one and a &s;hort one, for, alas! he was too fat for flight, and too fair a butt for &s;uch a mark&s;man not to hit. Vanity might have held him up in the pre&s;ence of a &s;econd per&s;on, but he could not impo&s;e upon him&s;elf; and after a deep &s;igh he broke forth into the following me|lancholy &s;oliloquy:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"What poor mi&s;erable mortals are we, who cannot fore&s;ee what may befall us for a moment to come! Here am I &s;hivering and &s;haking, and perhaps upon the bed of death, whereas but a few minutes ago I thought no more of death than I did of the pope of Rome. But, to be &s;ure, when a man is in perfect health, it is natural for him to keep &s;uch dull thoughts out of his head: it cannot be expected that one &s;hould be mu&s;ing and pondering upon the other world, when one &s;ees no pre&s;ent chance of going thither; whil&s;t things are at a di&s;tance, it is not nece&s;|&s;ary to think about them. Ah! poor Za|chary, thou ha&s;t enjoyed a brave &s;tate of health and kept a merry heart till this &s;ad moment; but art thou not an a&s;s and a blockhead, not to recollect that all fle&s;h is mortal?

aware of his &s;lippery tricks? How many hun|dred times has he made a fool and a fal&s;e pro|phet of thee, by &s;napping up thy patients in a twinkling, when thou, &s;illy Doctor, wa&s;t hug|ging thy&s;elf in the credit of a cure, and had&s;t pronounc'd them out of danger? And why, above all things, &s;hou'd I be vapouring with this poor lad, and &s;hewing off my courage at the expence of religion, which is about as wi&s;e a thing to do, as it wou'd be to pluck a &s;leeping bear by the beard. I know my wife to be a &s;lut and a &s;ot, and no more of a &s;aint than Judas I&s;cariot, but what then? Becau&s;e &s;he profe&s;&s;es more faith than &s;he has, why &s;hould I make a boa&s;t of believing le&s;s than I do?

If it would plea&s;e God to take my wife fir&s;t, it would be &s;ome comfort: I might then lead a quiet life, leave off practice, and begin to think &s;eriou&s;ly of my latter end; but, alas-a-day!

Aye, aye, I feel it at work; the powder begins to &s;tir; 'tis all for the be&s;t: the enemy is &s;hifting his quarters.

<P>He now applied him&s;elf lu&s;tily to the bell at his bed's head, for rea&s;ons that argued the nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;patch.

<HEAD>CHAPTER IX. Doctors differ.</HEAD>
<P>THERE was an old Scotchman, Alex|ander Kinloch by name, who officiated in the like capacity under Doctor Cawdle as <HI>Whackum</HI> did under <HI>Sidrophel.</HI> The care of the poorer patients in general devolved upon this deputy doctor, who, being an old limb of the faculty, was become &s;o &s;tubborn withal, that it &s;eemed a point with him in practice con&s;tantly to take any road but that which he conceived his principal would pur&s;ue. No &s;ooner had he been informed by Henry of his ma&s;ter's &s;ituation, and the medicine he had ad|mini&s;tered to him&s;elf, than, having taken two or three ha&s;ty &s;trides about the &s;hop, as if to give vent to his choler, he &s;natched down an old plaid night-gown, which hung upon a peg, and having girt it round his loins with a green wor&s;ted &s;a&s;h over a black cloth wai&s;tcoat, to
<PB N="61" REF="67">
which he had &s;tript him&s;elf for his work, he bade Henry look to the &s;hop, and imme|diately a&s;cended the &s;tairs to the chamber of the invalid.</P>
<P>If Death had been di&s;po&s;ed to have com|plimented Zachary with a vi&s;it, I que&s;tion if he could have taken a better figure for his pur|po&s;e than what Alexander now pre&s;ented to the &s;ick man's view, &s;tanding at the feet of his truckle bed, arrayed in his ru&s;ty plaid, tall, &s;qualid, begrimed with the du&s;t of the mor|tar, a perfect &s;keleton with the &s;kin on, and &s;taring upon him with two lack-lu&s;tre eyes, that &s;eemed buried in their boney lockets. A &s;tronger contra&s;t could hardly be found in hu|man nature than might here be &s;een between ma&s;ter and man; Zachary pre&s;enting to the eye of the &s;pectator a rotundity of figure, which, though in the horizontal po&s;ture, as now di&s;played, lo&s;t little, if any thing at all, of its perpendicular elevation from a given plane; Alexander, when erect upon his feet, being in the proportion of a foot to an inch in point of altitude, when compared with the afore&s;aid Alexander extended on his back; in few words, the one &s;tood in like relation to the other as the &s;piggot does to the tun.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="68">Zachary had no &s;ooner caught a glimp&s;e of Alexander's vi&s;age over the hillock of human fle&s;h, which intercepted nearly all the re&s;t of his figure, and being now under the impre&s;&s;ion of a terrified imagination, than he &s;hook in every joint, and though he recognized his old acquaintance &s;ufficiently to be &s;atisfied that Death was not actually pre&s;ent in per&s;on, yet he was far from certain that he had not vi&s;ited him by proxy; and in ju&s;tice to Zachary it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that a better proxy than Alexander, Death could no where have found, nor one to whom, upon long experience of pa&s;t &s;ervices, he could more &s;afely have con|fided a commi&s;&s;ion, either general or &s;pecial.</P>
<P>The deliberation with which Alexander had proceeded in his &s;urvey, (for it was a cu&s;tom with him to let the &s;ick man make his own complaints, by which he &s;pared him&s;elf the trouble of finding them out) gave the Doctor time to rally his &s;pirits &s;o far as to a&s;&s;ume an air of &s;ome compo&s;ure, whil&s;t he addre&s;&s;ed his vi&s;itor as follows:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Ah! Sawney, you find me here in a &s;orry pickle."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Aye, aye,"</Q> quoth the Scotchman, <Q REND="inline">"I can well enough &s;cent the pickle you are in; you have been &s;crubbing your inte&s;tines with that damn'd

What you &s;ay is very right, only you &s;ay it to the wrong per&s;on: every profe&s;&s;ional man, like you and me, will hold for the regular practice, and cry down quaok|cry; 'tis his duty &s;o to do, and as for the&s;e powders, I believe neither you nor any man living can &s;ay I ever admini&s;ter'd them to pa|tient of mine &s;ince I was ma&s;ter of a mortar; living or dying, my cu&s;tomers have been al|ways handled by me <HI>&s;ecundum artem:</HI> but the cook is not bound to eat his own porridge; neither am I, Zachary Cawdle, compell'd to take my own phy&s;ic; 'tis a fooli&s;h landlord that thinks to drive a trade by drinking out his own barrel."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, Doctor,"</Q> replied Death's image, <Q REND="inline">"&s;ince you are not to be advis'd, I &s;hall only remind you of the old &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">'Phy&s;ician, cure thy&s;elf."</Q></Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"And I've good hope I &s;hall cure my&s;elf,"</Q> returned the Doctor, <Q REND="inline">"and &s;peedily too, for I find I am wonderfully lighter &s;ince the

<P>The deputy doctor now departed in a huff, and left Zachary to &s;olicit, with the help of Doctor James, a kind turn from the only bet|ter friend in &s;ickne&s;s, &s;leep; but alas! though the&s;e two friendly <HI>re&s;torers of tir'd Nature,</HI> have been &s;eldom found at di&s;tance from each other, yet in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e Zachary's temples could take no re&s;t; he was tormented with a racking head-ach and a throbbing heart: all his terrors now returned, and he again applied him&s;elf to the bell at his bed's-head, ringing it with might and main.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"I never had the head-ach in my life,"</Q> re|plied Su&s;an.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I wi&s;h from my &s;oul you had it now for the fir&s;t time, and I was quit of it,"</Q> quoth Zachary. <Q REND="inline">"If it plagues you &s;o,"</Q> cried Su&s;an, <Q REND="inline">"why don't you lay your head down on the pillow and go to &s;leep; that's the way I get rid of all my troubles."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Get you gone for a goo&s;e,"</Q> cried the Doctor in a rage, <Q REND="inline">"and &s;end old Bridget to &s;et the room to rights."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Foh!"</Q> quoth Su&s;an as &s;he went down &s;tairs, <Q REND="inline">"your head may well ach o' my con&s;cience."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If one of my patients,"</Q> &s;aid Zachary to him&s;elf, <Q REND="inline">"con&s;ulted me upon a head-ach like this, I &s;hould make nothing of it: my bu&s;ine&s;s would be to give nature a fair field, and let her fight her own battles: cooling drinks, with endive, &s;uccory, pur&s;lain, lettuce, or barley-water

with a little cinnamon, is the mo&s;t I &s;hould admini&s;ter; but for my own part, I wi&s;h to be well at once; for I have no time to &s;pare, and I hate pain.</Q></P>
<P>During this meditation, Bridget had been em|ployed in removing nui&s;ances; when the Doc|tor, recollecting nothing in his own practice, that would &s;erve the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, and that old women frequently had no&s;trums that make quick work of what they undertake, repeated the &s;ame que&s;tion to Bridget, that he had put with &s;o little &s;ucce&s;s to Su&s;an. Proud to be con&s;ulted by &s;o great a man as her ma&s;ter, the old wench immediately demanded on which, &s;ide of his head the pain laid. <Q REND="inline">"On every &s;ide,"</Q> quoth Zachary, <Q REND="inline">"and all over it."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Then I can do you no good,"</Q> replied Bridget: <Q REND="inline">"had the pain laid on the right &s;ide, I could have cured it with a comb made of the right horn of a ram; if on the left, with one made of the left horn of a ram."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Begone for an old fool,"</Q> cried the Doctor; <Q REND="inline">"if ram's horns could have cured me, I &s;hould have been well long enough ago."</Q></P>
<P>Alexander Kinloch now re-entered the chamber, and with a &s;olemn countenance in|formed the Doctor that he had been &s;ent for to Mrs. Cawdle, whom he had found in her
<PB N="70" REF="76">
bed, grievou&s;ly afflicted with the head-ach ac|companied by a high pul&s;e, dry tongue, and other febrile &s;ymptoms. <Q REND="inline">"I am glad of it with all my heart,"</Q> exclaimed Zachary; <Q REND="inline">"and what have you admini&s;tered to her?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"No|thing,"</Q> replied Alexander, <Q REND="inline">"till I con&s;ulted you; but upon in&s;pection of the patient, I &s;hould humbly conceive there is nothing &s;o effectual to remove her complaint as evacua|tion and refrigeration."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Then &s;et about it thy&s;elf, friend Sawney,"</Q> quoth the Doctor, <Q REND="inline">"for I am in no condition to do either one or the other."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I have noted with &s;ome concern,"</Q> re&s;umed Alexander, <Q REND="inline">"that the ce|phalaea, or head-ach, of which Madam com|plaineth, lieth not in the pericranium, or out|ward &s;kin of the &s;cull, but in the pia mater, or in other words in that membrane, which knitteth the &s;en&s;es together, and lieth round the brain within the dura mater: now it is a point agreed both by ancients and mo|derns, that there are various &s;orts and de&s;crip|tions of head-achs; &s;ome po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the whole head, others only half of it; &s;ome coming of heat, others of cold; &s;ome of dryne&s;s, others of moi&s;ture; &s;ome ari&s;ing from plethory or plenitude of blood, others from choler."</Q>&mdash;
<PB N="71" REF="77">
<Q REND="inline">"Which will certainly be my ca&s;e,"</Q> cried the Doctor, interrupting him, <Q REND="inline">"unle&s;s you bring your di&s;cu&s;&s;ion to a point."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I am ha&s;tening thereunto,"</Q> replied Sawney: <Q REND="inline">"there are al&s;o head-achs, which proceed from windine&s;s; there are others cau&s;ed of the &s;tomach; there are head-achs &s;ymptomatic of fevers; and la&s;tly, there are head-achs originating from drunken|ne&s;s, to which denomination I pronounce this of Madam Cawdle's indi&s;putably to belong."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Who doubts it?"</Q> cried Zachary: <Q REND="inline">"then why the devil didn't you come to it at once?"</Q></P>
<P>Alexander gave no attention to the Doctor's impatience, but proceeded after his own man|ner&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Now the cau&s;es of this kind of head-ach are evident enough; for hot wines, &s;trong waters, and inflaming potations, fill the brain with vapours, and the brain of Madam Je|mima &s;o much the more, ina&s;much as I con|ceive it to be hot and adu&s;t by nature, having noted upon examination that her os triquetrum is clo&s;e &s;hut, and her &s;utoriums not remark|ably open; the beating or pul&s;ation therefore is the greater in a &s;cull &s;o con&s;tructed, and of cour&s;e the pain: the cure therefore con&s;i&s;teth, as I before &s;aid, in the&s;e two things, evacua|tion and refrigeration."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Humph!"</Q> echoed
<PB N="72" REF="78">
Zachary, with a grunt. Alexander proceeded: <Q REND="inline">"Now of the former there are various modes whereby to admini&s;ter relief, the choice of which I refer to you, as pre&s;uming you be&s;t know which proce&s;s of evacuation is mo&s;t con&s;entaneous to the habits and con&s;titution of Madam your &s;pou&s;e."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I beg to be excu&s;ed from giving any opinion at all in the ca&s;e,"</Q> &s;aid the Doctor. <Q REND="inline">"As for the latter,"</Q> continued the no&s;trum-monger, <Q REND="inline">"namely refrigeration, the u&s;e of which is to drive back the vapours as they a&s;cend to the head, I would recommend oil wherein ivy-leaves have been boiled; with which to anoint the head, the temples, and the forehead."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"With all my &s;oul,"</Q> repeated Zachary, <Q REND="inline">"I approve much of your ivy-leaves; they will be in their proper place upon her temples, for by my faith, Sawney, Jemima is as true a Bacchante as ever brandi&s;hed a thyr&s;us."</Q></P>
<P>Alexander had not yet run out his whole tap, and re&s;umed his di&s;cour&s;e once more:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Now to prevent drunkenne&s;s in tho&s;e, who are addicted to drink, is a grand de&s;ideratum in phy&s;ic; yet there are many medicines be|queathed to po&s;terity by the ancient &s;ages for this purpo&s;e."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"But I hope you are not

going to enumerate them,"</Q> quoth the Doctor, <Q REND="inline">"for I am out of all patience already."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Be it &s;o!"</Q> an&s;wered he; <Q REND="inline">"then I will con|fine my&s;elf to one alone, which is &s;imply this: <Q REND="inline">'Let the per&s;on &s;o addicted eat &s;ix or &s;even bitter almonds every morning fa&s;ting, drink a draught of wormwood-beer before any other potation; and let there be infu&s;ed therein a &s;mall portion of the a&s;hes of &s;wallows burnt in a crucible feathers and all."</Q></Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Wormwood and burnt &s;wallows!"</Q> cried Zachary, elevating his voice; <Q REND="inline">"what devil of a doctor put that do&s;e into your head?

<HEAD>CHAPTER X. One more Do&s;e than is to be found in the Di&s;pen&s;ary.</HEAD>
<P>THE medical under&s;trapper, who was in|debted to Doctor Nicholas Culpepper's <HI>La&s;t Legacy</HI> for every one of the&s;e no&s;trums, upon which he plumed him&s;elf &s;o highly in &s;pite of his ma&s;ter's irony, immediately &s;et to work upon his embrocation of ivy-leaves and oil, a bu&s;ine&s;s of no great difficulty, as there was a certain man&s;ion in the garden over-grown with that &s;imple, and no &s;carcity of good Lucca oil in the cupboard near at hand: but when he came to meditate upon a &s;ucce|daneum for the burnt &s;wallows, even Zachary's propo&s;al of the owl as a locum-tenens was a &s;taggering con&s;ideration, as being a bird of night, whereas it was now unfortunately broad day. In this dilemma &s;eeing Henry in the &s;hop, he abruptly demanded of him if he was a good hand at catching an owl: the youth, &s;uppo&s;ing he was bantering him, &s;tared him in the face, and, without giving any an&s;wer, went about his bu&s;ine&s;s. The compounder of me|dicines in the mean time ca&s;t his eyes round
<PB N="75" REF="81">
the &s;hop, as in de&s;pair of finding any &s;ub&s;ti|tute for his purpo&s;e, when in a lucky moment fortune threw within his ken a dried lizard hanging from the beam, which for time im|memorial had been the humble companion of a &s;tuft aligator and the egg of an o&s;trich.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Aha! my little crony,"</Q> cried Alexander as he ey'd the lizard with tran&s;port, <Q REND="inline">"you and I mu&s;t have a word together: come down, for I have &s;pied thee in the very nick of time."</Q> This &s;aid, he unhook'd the little ani|mal, and examined him from head to tail: he was as dry as the mummy of a patriarch; no crucible could have done the jobb more ef|fectually; he was a perfect deodand in the hands of an experimentali&s;t. <Q REND="inline">"Thou wilt pul|verize mo&s;t featly,"</Q> quoth Sawney, <Q REND="inline">"when I have thee under the pe&s;tle; but before I con|&s;ign thee to the mortar and reduce thee to du&s;t, let me ponder upon thy properties, and do nothing without foreca&s;t and circum&s;pec|tion. Poi&s;onous thou can'&s;t not be, for though I have never eaten of thy &s;pecies my&s;elf, I know that others have; I have read that thou art a delicacy, a tit-bit as I may &s;ay, at the tables of the Chine&s;e, and if thy fle&s;h be de|licate, thy du&s;t cannot fail to be whole&s;ome;
<PB N="76" REF="82">
nay, I doubt not but it is medicinal, a drug to my very purpo&s;e, an ab&s;orbent, a repeller, an antidote to drunkenne&s;s, for the Chine&s;e are the &s;obere&s;t nation upon earth. I'll begin upon thee incontinently. But hold, hold! whi|ther am I running? Thou ha&s;t other virtues, if I could but recollect them; there is &s;ome|thing more about thee; &s;omething I have read in learned authors of the back-bone of a lizard; and thine, Heaven be prais'd, I per|ceive is perfect and entire; but whether it is recorded as a provocative to incontinency, or as a preventive, I cannot for the blood of me to a certainty recollect: upon &s;econd thoughts, I &s;u&s;pect thou art a &s;timulative; as I'm a &s;inner, I &s;u&s;pect thou art of a &s;tirring quality, for thy tail betokeneth it. Be it as it may, I will venture upon thee, for thou art a loving little creature, and fam'd above all the reptile race for being the friend of man: therein thou wilt a&s;&s;imilate in property with thy patient, for truly Madam Jemima is of an amorous and mo&s;t incontinent propen&s;ity."</Q></P>
<P>This &s;aid, he took the animal by the tail, and with an air of triumph hurl'd it into the mortar, covering it up, as well to conceal his trea&s;ure from di&s;covery, as to pre&s;erve it again&s;t
<PB N="77" REF="83">
injury. He now turn'd his hand to the re|frigerating embrocation of oil and ivy-leaves, which having put into a phial, and properly labell'd, he con&s;ign'd to Su&s;an, directing her how to apply it to the temples and forehead of her mi&s;tre&s;s: his next bu&s;ine&s;s was to take &s;ix bitter almonds out of the drawer, and in|clo&s;e them in a writing paper labelled accord|ing to form, and the&s;e he depo&s;ited upon the counter, re&s;erving them as an introductory kind of preamble to his grand arcanum now in actual projection, for old Bridget had in charge to prepare the wormwood-beer, &s;o that all hands were now bu&s;y and the work was in forward|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t Alexander was belabouring the lizard, for it was a tough mor&s;el, Su&s;an had performed her part, and &s;o plentifully had &s;he be&s;towed the unction on the temples of the rubicund Bacchante, that Jemima's face, thus varni&s;hed, pre&s;ented to the beholder an intire ma&s;k of crim&s;on foyle, with the contra&s;t of a pair of ferocious dark eyes, &s;parkling under the &s;hag|gy canopy of two enormous brows of the &s;ame &s;ubfu&s;can hue with the eyes they over-arched.</P>
<P>Her malady, it is true, was con&s;iderably abated, but whether it was owing to the re|frigerating
<PB N="78" REF="84">
mixture, or to a cordial do&s;e of ani|&s;eed, which &s;he had ju&s;t taken, is not for my purpo&s;e to enquire. Alexander now called lu&s;tily for Su&s;an to admini&s;ter the bitter al|monds, but Su&s;an was not to be found; &s;he had walked into the village: Bridget was bu&s;y with the wormwood-beer, and as for him&s;elf, he was &s;till in warm action with the lizard, who &s;hewed great antipathy to being pulve|rized, and made a notable defence again&s;t the ince&s;&s;ant battery of mortar and pe&s;tle.</P>
<P>What was to be done? Henry was the only per&s;on unemployed, but Henry had &s;trong ob|jections to any errand that was to carry him into Jemima's bed-chamber. <Q REND="inline">"If &s;uch be your &s;cruples at &s;tarting,"</Q> &s;aid Kinloch, <Q REND="inline">"I pronounce at once you will never do for us in our way of bu&s;ine&s;s: we mu&s;t go to all pa|tients, and the &s;ex of a &s;ick per&s;on is the la&s;t thing in our thoughts: are you afraid of ri&s;qu|ing that &s;mooth face of your's in your mi&s;|tre&s;s's room, and have you the conceit to think &s;he will play the part of Potiphar's wife?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Stop your raillery,"</Q> cried Henry, <Q REND="inline">"and &s;pare your&s;elf the pains of a very clum&s;y at|tempt at being witty, till I know what my duty is, and then I &s;hall obey it."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="85">He &s;tept &s;oftly up to Zachary's chamber, but finding him a&s;leep, &s;hut the door with great caution, and returned. Unwilling to re|new an altercation with Kinloch, and finding that Bridget made altogether as light of his &s;cruples, he took the pacquet of almonds, and having gently given notice at Jemima's door, was no le&s;s gently invited to enter it.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am ordered to bring you this medicine,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"which Mr. Kinloch has prepar'd, and recommends you to take."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Give it me into my hand,"</Q> &s;aid the dame, and at the &s;ame time taking it with one hand, and cla&s;ping his wri&s;t with the other, &s;he ca&s;t a look of kind|ne&s;s upon him, and &s;aid &s;he did not doubt it would do her good, when tender'd to her by him, though &s;he had no faith in any thing of Sawney's pre&s;cribing.</P>
<P>So &s;aying &s;he unfolded the paper, and to her utter &s;urprize found that it enveloped only half a dozen almonds. <Q REND="inline">"What does the fool mean by this?"</Q> cried &s;he; <Q REND="inline">"what good are the&s;e paltry things to do me? Let the old ape eat them him&s;elf,"</Q> and with that &s;he flung them away; <Q REND="inline">"But you, Henry, you do me all the good in life; your pre&s;ence is a cordial, that revives my drooping &s;pirits, and whether

<P>Henry, who &s;aw her eyes fla&s;hing, and her face red and &s;hining like a ball of fire, &s;up|po&s;ed that &s;he was in a high fever fit, and de|lirious: he gently entreated her to be more compos'd, whil&s;t he ran down and call'd up tho&s;e, who were better able to a&s;&s;i&s;t her. <Q REND="inline">"Stop, I conjure you,"</Q> &s;he exclaim'd; <Q REND="inline">"if you fancy me in &s;uch a &s;tate of danger, can you have the heart to leave me?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I will only leave you for a moment,"</Q> he replied, <Q REND="inline">"till I fetch Mr. Kinloch."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Are you in your &s;en&s;es,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"to &s;uppo&s;e that I can be comforted by the &s;ight of &s;ueh a &s;care-crow as old Kinloch? I want neither him nor his ma&s;ter, nor any of their potions, which I loath and dete&s;t, and hold to be the vile&s;t tra&s;h upon earth. Had I any body about me with half a grain of &s;en&s;e or feeling, I &s;hould want none of their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. You, Henry, have a heart, or I am mi&s;taken; you can under&s;tand what I mu&s;t endure in a family like this, and can pity

me: Cou'd I bind you to me by confidence, by favours, by affection, there is nothing I would not do to recompen&s;e and reward your attachment."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Madam,"</Q> replied Henry, <Q REND="inline">"&s;o long as I receive the wages of Doctor Cawdle, you are intitled to every &s;ervice I can render you, con&s;i&s;tent with honour and my duty to him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What honour and what duty do you owe to him, which you are not in an equal de|gree bound to fulfil towards me? Nay, if you are not lo&s;t to every manly feeling, you will own that as a woman I have a &s;uperior claim to your attentions: if you are &s;way'd by in|tere&s;t, can you he&s;itate between me and him? If you are capable of being touch'd by a more generous pa&s;&s;ion, where can you more worthily be&s;tow it, than on one who has no &s;cruple to confe&s;s the impre&s;&s;ion you have made upon her heart?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"On your heart!"</Q> cried Henry, <Q REND="inline">"is it po&s;|&s;ible you can be &s;erious in this declaration? or am I only to regard it as the wandering of a feveri&s;h delirium?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Regard it in no other &s;en&s;e,"</Q> &s;he replied, <Q REND="inline">"than as the frank confe&s;&s;ion of a woman, who is above the mean practice of di&s;gui&s;ing what &s;he feels, and

who&s;e mind is made up to the conviction, that what nature dictates mu&s;t be right."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"If that be your rule, Madam,"</Q> quoth Henry, <Q REND="inline">"you cannot be offended with me for adopt|ing it; therefore, as my nature dictates to me the impropriety of holding any further con|ver&s;ation with you upon this &s;ubject, you will pardon me if I cut it &s;hort and take my leave."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Perver&s;e, provoking, ob&s;tinate, hard fate!"</Q> exclaim'd the di&s;appointed fair, as &s;oon as he had departed; <Q REND="inline">"thus is the patience of the &s;aints for ever exercis'd by trials and temptations.

<P>WHEN Jemima was left to reflect &s;eri|ou&s;ly upon the rebuff &s;he had met from Henry, and found it no longer po&s;&s;ible to turn it to her credit by any &s;ophi&s;try or &s;elf-delu&s;ion that her vanity could &s;ugge&s;t, nothing remained but to &s;oothe her&s;elf with &s;chemes and projects of revenge; and in the cour&s;e of the&s;e meditations it naturally occurred to her, that whil&s;t &s;he kept &s;o fine a girl in her &s;er|vice as Su&s;an May, &s;he would never be with|out a rival in her own family; and as this was not the fir&s;t mortification of the &s;ort &s;he had encountered &s;ince that girl had been about her per&s;on, &s;he began to think that in good po|licy &s;he could not be too quick in getting rid of her.

<P>Although few gentlewomen in Mrs. Caw|dle's circum&s;tances would have had the conde|&s;cen&s;ion to be &s;o explicit with a &s;ervant ju&s;t hired into their family, yet that gracious per|&s;onage, mindful, no doubt, of the time when &s;he her&s;elf took po&s;t in that low order of &s;o|ciety, had neither that pride of virtue nor that delicacy of &s;entiment about her to be wounded by reflections of this &s;ort; faithful to her an|tient habits, &s;he was in the practice of plain deal|ing on tho&s;e occa&s;ions where other ladies u&s;e fine&s;&s;e, and by making her wi&s;hes well under|&s;tood was &s;ure of bringing them to a &s;peedy i&s;&s;ue at all events, and avoiding that mo&s;t painful of all &s;ituations, a &s;tate of expectation and &s;u&s;pen&s;e. At the &s;ame time when tho&s;e wi&s;hes were cro&s;&s;ed and thwarted, the good lady had a due &s;en&s;e of her own dignity, and re&s;ented a di&s;appointment with as much &s;pirit as her warme&s;t admirers could wi&s;h her to have; and never was this &s;pirit more tho|roughly called forth than at the pre&s;ent mo|ment by Henry's unaccountable neglect of her mo&s;t gracious advances; a circum&s;tance that

&s;eemed to run counter to all calculation; for who &s;o unlikely to with&s;tand temptation as a creature de&s;titute of every thing, and without a friend upon earth?

<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e re&s;olutions were forming in the bo&s;om of the indignant dame, Henry's thoughts were employed upon mea&s;ures for anticipating their execution by a voluntary &s;e|ce&s;&s;ion, for it &s;eemed to him incon&s;i&s;tent with propriety to remain any longer in his pre&s;ent &s;ervice: his mind, trained in the principles of honour, and uncontaminated by impure con|nections, revolted from the idea of taking wages from the hu&s;band and bribes from the wife: his experience of adver&s;ity, though &s;hort,

<P>In the pur&s;uit of the&s;e meditations he had already pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;olitary minutes, whil&s;t old Bridget was occupied el&s;ewhere; when Su&s;an May came in from her walk to the village, and took her &s;eat be&s;ide him.

She felt too &s;trongly in her own heart the emotions which a per&s;on like Henry's was capable of in&s;pir|ing, not to credit her mi&s;tre&s;s for the like &s;en|&s;ations; &s;he &s;poke of her without re&s;erve, and pronounced upon his motives with &s;uch confi|dence, as &s;oon as &s;he under&s;tood he had at|tended upon her with her medicines, that though &s;he could not bring him to confe&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="89" REF="95">
&s;he took his &s;ilence for a&s;&s;ent, and proceeded without interruption till &s;he had exhau&s;ted her eloquence on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>When he told her of his intention to enli&s;t, &s;he &s;ighed, and &s;aid &s;he knew too well what hard|&s;hips a &s;oldier &s;uffered, for &s;he had had a bro|ther in the army, as fine a young man as ever was &s;een, but he was now no more; he was killed at the &s;iege of Gibraltar, in a &s;ally upon the Spani&s;h lines; &s;he hoped that Henry would not run &s;uch a de&s;perate cour&s;e; for her part &s;he did not &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity there was for his leaving the Doctor's &s;ervice merely becau&s;e her mi&s;tre&s;s had whims in her head, which, when &s;he was more calm, would pro|bably &s;ub&s;ide; &s;he mu&s;t own it was extremely natural that &s;o hand&s;ome a young man &s;hould be admired by the women; it was what he mu&s;t expect, go where he would, but then it was always in his power to return it or not, as his inclination prompted him; and though it was again&s;t nature to &s;uppo&s;e he could ever throw away his regards upon &s;uch an object as her mi&s;tre&s;s, yet had it been a ca&s;e where ages were &s;uitable, and love was on both &s;ides, &s;he took for granted the &s;ame &s;cruples would not have operated; for an attachment of that &s;ort

<P>As &s;he &s;aid this &s;he leant her hand carele&s;sly on his &s;houlder; it was one of tho&s;e move|ments that intend a great deal and profe&s;s to mean nothing; but whil&s;t &s;he was &s;itting in this attitude, enveloped in the contemplation of one of the fine&s;t countenances in nature, behold! on a &s;udden one very little re&s;em|bling it, the property of Alexander Kinloch, pre&s;ented it&s;elf to her view, that learned per|&s;on having &s;ilently crept into the kitchen and &s;urprized them in their conference.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Aha! my young &s;park!"</Q> quoth the in|terloper, <Q REND="inline">"is it thus you pa&s;s your time, whil&s;t I am toiling like a galley-&s;lave at an oar till my fingers cling to the pe&s;tle? I have

<P>Su&s;an turned her eyes upon the &s;peaker, and with a &s;mile that would have &s;oftened the heart of Herod, apologized for Henry by taking all the blame to her&s;elf:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I was telling him,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"what a kind &s;oul you are, and what a world of knowledge he may gain from your in&s;tructions, if he will but &s;tay among&s;t us; but indeed and indeed, my good Mr. Kinloch, I am afraid there will be no living in this hou&s;e for any of us long, if my mi&s;tre&s;s is to go on at this rate."</Q></P>
<P>This was touching the very ma&s;ter-&s;tring of Kinloch's mental machinery, who hated Je|mima as cordially as he loved to hear his own prai&s;es. Su&s;an had ingeniou&s;ly contrived in a &s;hort compa&s;s to give him a &s;mall remem|brance of both; the con&s;equence was an in|&s;tant truce between him and Henry, who was neverthele&s;s con&s;trained to be a patient hearer of a long and furious philippic from the jour|neyman

doctor, in which he belaboured poor Jemima without mercy, and not the le&s;s vi|rulently for the affront &s;he had &s;o lately put upon him, when &s;he returned the potion upon his hands, which he had compounded with &s;uch care and &s;kill. Not that his oration con&s;i&s;ted, like &s;ome that might be named, of one continued &s;train of invective, for on the contrary it was relieved every now and then with a &s;trong da&s;h of the panegyric, of which he was him&s;elf the &s;ole hero, on all which occa&s;ions he took e&s;pecial care to contra&s;t the brilliancy of his own charac|ter by throwing that of his ma&s;ter Zachary into &s;hade; and in truth there was no other way of bringing the weight of their re&s;pective abilities to any thing like a balance but this which Alexander adopted for making his own &s;cale equiponderate, by borrowing from that which el&s;e would have cau&s;ed him to kick the beam.</P>
<P>When he had pretty well exhau&s;ted the ca|talogue of Jemima's failings, and added a few more items to the account of his own per|fections, than a le&s;s partial calculator would have di&s;covered, the tempe&s;t of his wrath &s;ub&s;ided into &s;o perfect a calm, that he began
<PB N="93" REF="99">
to rally the young people in a &s;train which he mi&s;took for humour; and when he under&s;tood from Su&s;an that Henry meditated a ha&s;ty re|treat, he heartily joined her in per&s;uading him not to quit the po&s;t he had taken, where &s;uch mighty advantages might be reaped by a diligent attention to the in&s;tructions he &s;hould give him, and by the opportunities he would have of &s;eeing the art practi&s;ed in its greate&s;t perfection:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I own to you,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"that there is &s;omething to get over before you can &s;ubmit to &s;erve a woman like your mi&s;tre&s;s; for whether it is your lot to fall into her good graces or her ill ones, &s;he is equally intolerable. As for the Doctor, poor man, he is a mere cypher in the hou&s;e, and pretty nearly &s;o in his profe&s;&s;ion; the weight of that re&s;ts upon me; &s;o that with him you will have little to do and le&s;s to learn; with me you will have enough of both: but you well know there is no learning without labour, as Ari|&s;totle wi&s;ely ob&s;erves; therefore courage, my good lad, think no more of the trouble&s;ome woman above &s;tairs, who has thrown away the only chance &s;he had for a longer &s;tay in this world by rejecting a medicine that might have wrought wonders in her con&s;titution;

<P>Alexander now produced a phial containing the a&s;hes of the lizard &s;teeped in wormwood-beer, and delivered it with many charges to Henry, directing him the &s;trait road to the George and Dragon ale-hou&s;e, where he was to give it into the hands of Dame Dunckley, the ho&s;te&s;s, who&s;e &s;tomach, after all the hard &s;ervices it had gone through in the cour&s;e of her profe&s;&s;ion, was now de&s;tined to en|counter a do&s;e that might have di&s;compo&s;ed the nerves of a &s;tone-eater.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER I. Rea&s;ons for writing as fa&s;t as we can.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE rules which a well-bred man lays down for him&s;elf, when he engages in the difficult ta&s;k of telling a long &s;tory about per|&s;ons unknown to the circle he is in, may with equal propriety be adopted by an author in the conduct of a novel: both pur&s;ue the &s;ame ob|ject, and both incur the &s;ame ri&s;que of failing in the pur&s;uit, which certainly requires a con|&s;iderable &s;hare of management and addre&s;s to &s;ucceed in.</P>
<P>A &s;tory will infallibly di&s;gu&s;t if it is told in vulgar and ill-cho&s;en language; if interlarded with affected phra&s;es, or florid de&s;criptions, that advance no intere&s;t; if it is delivered in a pedantic laboured &s;tile, un&s;uitable to charac|ters in familiar life, if it &s;ub&s;titutes dull jokes and ribaldry in the place of wit and plea&s;antry; if the teller either digre&s;&s;es too often from the main &s;ubject, or dwells too long and circum|&s;tantially
<PB N="96" REF="102">
upon matters not &s;ufficiently impor|tant or amu&s;ing; in &s;hort, if it fails in any of tho&s;e requi&s;ites that &s;hould keep the attention wakeful and alert, it is a bad &s;tory, and the teller has wilfully brought him&s;elf into di&s;|grace with his hearers by cheating them of their expectations and abu&s;ing their indul|gence.</P>
<P>So is it with the novel-writer; the &s;ame faults will be puni&s;hed with the &s;ame con|tempt.</P>
<P>Be the matter ever &s;o intere&s;ting, which falls to the ta&s;k of any one man to relate in public company, he will naturally be a&s;hamed of keeping their attention too long upon the &s;tretch; and if he cannot prevail upon other tongues to move, yet in good manners and common delicacy, he will contrive to make &s;ome breaks and pau&s;es in his narrative, which may give relief to the ear, and &s;ome degree of relaxation to the mind. This &s;eems generally under&s;tood by the novel-writer, who, by the di&s;tribution of his matter into books and chap|ters, tenders to the reader in his &s;everal &s;tages &s;o many inns or baiting-places by the way, where he hangs out a &s;ign that there is re&s;t at lea&s;t to be had for the weary traveller.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="103">An eminent author, who&s;e talent for novel-writing was unequalled, and who&s;e authority ought greatly to weigh with all, who &s;ucceed him in the &s;ame line, furni&s;hed his baiting-places with &s;uch ingenious ho&s;pitality, as not only to &s;upply his gue&s;ts with the nece&s;&s;ary remi&s;&s;ions from fatigue, but al&s;o to recruit them with viands of a very nutritive as well as palatable quality. According to this figure of &s;peech, (which cannot be mi&s;taken, as alluding to his prefatory chapters) he was not only a plea&s;ant facetious companion by the way, but acted the part of an admirable ho&s;t at every one of the inns. Alas! it was famous tra|velling in his days: I remember him full well, and de&s;pair of ever meeting his like again, upon that road at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>Others there have been, and one there was of the &s;ame day, who was a well-meaning civil &s;oul, and had a &s;oft &s;impering kind of addre&s;s, that took mightily with the ladies, whom he contrived to u&s;her through a long, long journey, with their handkerchiefs at their eyes, weep|ing and wailing by the way, till he conducted them, at the clo&s;e of it, either to a ravi&s;hment or a funeral, or perhaps to a madhou&s;e, where he
<PB N="98" REF="104">
left them to get off as they could. He was a charming man, and had a deal of cu&s;tom, but the other's was the hou&s;e that I frequented.</P>
<P>There was a third, &s;omewhat po&s;terior in time, not in talents, who was indeed a rough driver, and rather too &s;evere to his cattle; but, in faith, he carried us on at a merry pace over land or &s;ea; nothing came ami&s;s to him, for he was up to both elements, and a match for na|ture in every &s;hape, character, and degree: he was not very courteous, it mu&s;t be owned, for he had a capacity for higher things, and was above his bu&s;ine&s;s: he only wanted a little more &s;uavity and di&s;cretion to have figured with the be&s;t.</P>
<P>With the&s;e I &s;hall &s;top; for another &s;tep would bring me into company with the living, and of my partiality for my contemporaries I am too con&s;cious to put my judgment to the ri&s;que of critici&s;m, which may not be over-indulgent to mi&s;takes of the heart. Them and my&s;elf I implicitly re&s;ign to the favour and protection of tho&s;e public &s;pirited in&s;pec|tors of literature, who undertake the laborious ta&s;k of reviewing every thing we write, and who under&s;tand &s;o well the policy of the wi&s;e Lacedaemonians, that no &s;ooner do they light
<PB N="99" REF="105">
upon a deformed or ricketty bantling, but they charitably &s;trangle it outright, and don't let it &s;urvive to di&s;grace us with po&s;terity. This is mercy to the age at large, though any one of us, upon whom it falls, is apt to call it cruelty, when we are &s;ent to the trunk-maker and the pa&s;try-cook to drive the be&s;t bargain we can for our property, before it is turned over to the worms, who then only take us into reading when nobody el&s;e will: but &s;uch is our ob&s;tinacy notwith&s;tanding, that it &s;eems as if we &s;pitefully wrote the more in contradic|tion to our real friends, who fairly tell us we cannot write at all.</P>
<P>However, at the very wor&s;t, we can always draw this con&s;olation from our faults, that our kind correctors have had infinite plea&s;ure in finding them out; for &s;urely if the di&s;covery gave pain, no man would voluntary engage in the &s;earch.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o another cheering reflection we have to feed upon, which is, that tho&s;e authors, who &s;hall follow us in point of time, will fall &s;hort of us in point of merit. Homer him&s;elf tells us this, who, as an Epic poet, was &s;urely intere&s;ted to hold up his heroes as high as he could, and yet is compelled to confe&s;s
<PB N="100" REF="106">
that the pelting they be&s;towed upon each other was but children's play compared to what their fathers could do at that &s;port. Now it is clear, that from Homer's day to the pre|&s;ent hour there has been a gradual falling off in the human powers, mental and bodily; from which I infer that the novel la&s;t written may always be pre&s;umed the wor&s;t that ever was written; and therefore that it behoves every writer, and my&s;elf among&s;t the re&s;t, to write as fa&s;t as ever we can, for the longer we are about it the wor&s;e it will be. And this re|minds me that I ought to bring this chapter to a conclu&s;ion, and attend to the hi&s;tory, which, in the mean time, has been &s;tanding &s;till, and cannot profit by a pau&s;e.</P>

<P>Among&s;t the people, who were drinking, there was one in a &s;ailor's jacket, who went by the nickname of Bow&s;ey, a bold and re&s;olute fellow, who occa&s;ionally u&s;ed the &s;ea, and at intervals returned to his pari&s;h to make wa&s;te of his earnings, and rai&s;e what contributions he could upon the neighbourhood, by &s;naring game, or any other pilfering and illegal de|predations, which he could turn his hand to. This Bow&s;ey was the terror of all his indu&s;|trious neighbours, and the favourite of all the idle ones.

<P>This ingenious per&s;on, who&s;e attachment to Ju&s;tice Blachford was pretty much of the &s;ort with what the devil is vulgarly &s;aid to have to holy-water, had no &s;ooner heard the landlord out, than turning to him with an angry look and &s;urly voice, he reprimanded him for his contemptuous treatment of a &s;tranger, who had given him no offence, de|manding of the company round, if any man had a right to be called a rogue, till he was found out to be one.&mdash;A nod of a&s;&s;ent from the tiplers pre&s;ent encouraged him to proceed.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"And who but a &s;candalous fellow would go about to bla&s;t a poor lad's character for nothing but becau&s;e he would not plead to your damn'd impertinent que&s;tions?

<P>The&s;e words were &s;carce out of his mouth, when a company of young men entered the alehou&s;e kitchen in a riotous manner, among&s;t whom was Tom Weevil, the miller's &s;on, whom Henry had the &s;cuffle with at the ford. The death of his dog, and the di&s;grace he fell into on that occa&s;ion, &s;till rankled in his mind, and he had now &s;et out with a full re&s;olution to wreak his vengeance upon his antagoni&s;t, for which purpo&s;e he had brought a parcel of his cronies to back him: with the&s;e fellows he had been taking a cup to give a &s;pur to his
<PB N="106" REF="112">
courage, and put &s;pirits in him for the en|counter. No &s;ooner, therefore, had he &s;et eyes upon the object of his re&s;entment, than he be|gan to a&s;&s;ail him in the mo&s;t opprobrious terms, be&s;towing many hard names upon him, and challenging him to fight it out fairly on the green before the door.</P>
<P>The meekne&s;s of Henry's expo&s;tulation had no other effect, than to provoke a torrent of oaths and defiances, repeated in language the mo&s;t in&s;ulting, and echoed by his colleagues, who played the part of chorus to the leading &s;train. Nathaniel Dunckley, the ho&s;t, who had been an approving hearer of all the foul words, which the miller had &s;o liberally be|&s;towed upon the unoffending &s;tranger, and who was well di&s;po&s;ed to put the wor&s;t interpreta|tion upon his patience, now began to triumph in his turn, and to plume him&s;elf on his &s;a|gacity in having &s;pied out the traces of a rogue in the mo&s;t innocent countenance in nature. In the mean time Bow&s;ey, who had not the &s;malle&s;t objection to a battle, e&s;pecially where he was not to be principal, began to exalt his voice amid&s;t the uproar, and to blu&s;ter in behalf of the weaker party, whom he now declared to be his friend, and one that
<PB N="107" REF="113">
he would &s;econd, if he wou'd turn out again&s;t Weevil, whom he retorted upon with the more acrimony, as owing him an old grudge on pa&s;t accounts.</P>
<P>The young miller, who found him&s;elf in a &s;trong majority, and well backed by every body about him, an&s;wered Bow&s;ey in his own &s;train, telling him, that he knew well enough why he was &s;o &s;piteful again&s;t him, becau&s;e he had caught him at his pilfering tricks, and de&s;troyed the trimmers and thief-nets he had &s;et in the river; <Q REND="inline">"but I give you fair warn|ing, my ma&s;ter,"</Q> added he with an oath, <Q REND="inline">"that the very next time I trap you at that &s;port, you &s;hall &s;wing for it like a rogue as you are."</Q></P>
<P>Bow&s;ey, not the le&s;s galled by this charge for knowing it was true, grew furious with rage, and &s;haking his fi&s;t at him in a threat|ening attitude, bade him take heed what he &s;aid, for though he was now in the mid&s;t of his myrmidons, the time would come when he &s;hould find an opportunity to make him repent of his vapouring, which, he might de|pend upon it, &s;hould not go unrevenged. <Q REND="inline">"Shame upon you!"</Q> cried dame Dunckley, from the chimney corner, <Q REND="inline">"would you go to
<PB N="108" REF="114">
murder the young man for &s;peaking the truth? Take notice, neighbours, and remember what he &s;ays: 'tis a pity but the ju&s;tice heard it."</Q> The ju&s;tice did not hear it, but there were &s;ome who did, and as his hou&s;e was no further off than acro&s;s the green, the hint, if well under&s;tood, had not far to travel, and there is rea&s;on to think it found the road thither very &s;peedily, and without any lo&s;s by the way.</P>
<P>Henry, who found him&s;elf unintentionally a witne&s;s to conver&s;ation, for which he had no reli&s;h, was in the very act of retiring out of company, when his challenger caught him by the arm, and in a bullying tone peremptorily demanded if he would turn out like a man, and &s;et to upon the green, or &s;culk like a coward from a fair propo&s;al, and be kick'd about the hou&s;e. This was &s;econded by a loud &s;hout from the party, and even Bow&s;ey &s;eemed aba&s;hed, being awed into &s;ilence by the pro&s;pect of half a &s;core &s;tout cudgels, brandi&s;hed in the air, and ready to execute any kind of vengeance, that might be required of them by the champion of the gang.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You may quit your hold of me,"</Q> &s;aid Henry to the miller, <Q REND="inline">"for I &s;hall not run
<PB N="109" REF="115">
away from any man, who threatens me with a kicking. If you really mean to put it into execution, I hope the&s;e gentlemen at your back will leave you to your&s;elf, and not a&s;&s;i&s;t in the doing it: they may &s;hout on your &s;ide, and brandi&s;h their &s;ticks as much as they plea&s;e, but even that is not very manly, con|&s;idering I am here a &s;tranger, and without a friend, except this &s;ingle man, who &s;eems to have drawn him&s;elf into danger and ill will, by taking part with the weaker &s;ide, and &s;tand|ing forth in my defence. Whether I de&s;erve this treatment for what pa&s;s'd between us at the mill, you may a&s;k your own con&s;cience; I &s;hall make no appeal to a company like this, who &s;eem determin'd to bear me down, right or wrong, by noi&s;e and numbers. Take notice, Mr. Weevil, that if I was one of tho&s;e, who make boxing a &s;cience, I &s;hou'd be war|ranted in declining your challenge, for you are in all re&s;pects above my match, heavier, and &s;tronger, and taller than me; but, never|thele&s;s, if you are determined to have me out, don't be at the trouble of kicking me, for that may be fatal to one of us in a room like this, and probably not very plea&s;ant to the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e: go forth into the green,

chu&s;e your ground, and I'll take my chance for a beating, rather than be kick'd into cou|rage, which is a di&s;cipline I am not u&s;ed to, and have no &s;tomach for."</Q></P>
<P>A murmur ran through the crowd, that would have been applau&s;e, if there had not been &s;omething nearer to their hearts, than ju&s;tice or genero&s;ity. The young miller &s;tept forward, and drawing a canva&s;s pur&s;e out of his pocket, emptied it's contents upon the table, in gold and &s;ilver, to no trifling amount, and vauntingly called upon Henry to &s;take all, or any part, of the amount upon the battle. When this was altogether declined on the part of Henry, he gathered up his ca&s;h again, while dame Dunckley from her wicker chair, like the Pythia from her tripod, prophetically exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"What &s;hou'd you fight for, ye fooli&s;h boys? mind, if you don't draw the ju&s;tice out of his den upon you both."</Q> The voice of divination was not heard; the die was ca&s;t for battle, and forth ru&s;hed the whole company upon the green.</P>
<P>Now Bow&s;ey was in his element: provided with a bottle of water in one hand, a coloured handkerchief and a lemon in the other, he fallied forth upon the field of battle, taking his
<PB N="111" REF="117">
champion under the arm, and as they walked apart from the crowd, whi&s;pering many &s;age in&s;tructions in his ear, where to place his blows with be&s;t effect, and pointing out cer|tain vital parts, where a well-directed &s;troke might effectually di&s;able his antagoni&s;t, and en&s;ure the victory. In this however the pro|fe&s;&s;or and the pupil did by no means agree: vengeance rankled in Bow&s;ey's brea&s;t; courage and humanity held divided empire in the heart of Henry. <Q REND="inline">"Be content,"</Q> he replied, <Q REND="inline">"I'll foil him without maiming him; he is more than half tip&s;ey, and will be out of breath in a few minutes; t'wou'd be a &s;in to hurt him: boxing has been a kind of boyi&s;h exerci&s;e with me, and I never yet practis'd it in wrath, much le&s;s with mi&s;chief and ran|cour in my mind: my aim will be to avoid his blows, and let him beat him&s;elf."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Don't make too &s;ure of that,"</Q> replied Bow&s;ey; <Q REND="inline">"I know his way of fighting, for I have taken a round or two with him my&s;elf; he &s;trikes as hard as the kick of a hor&s;e."</Q>&mdash;Henry now took off his jacket, and recollecting a large cla&s;p-knife, which he wore in the &s;ide pocket of his breeches, delivered it to Bow&s;ey, ob|&s;erving that it might hurt him in his falls:
<PB N="112" REF="118">
and being now dive&s;ted of all weapons but what nature had given him, he advanced cheerfully to the ring, where his brawny op|ponent, like another Goliath, &s;tood encircled by his Phili&s;tines, and whom he now ap|proached with a complacent &s;mile, tendering him his hand, and &s;aying,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Come, miller, let us be friends before we &s;et to; I hope you bear no malice, and will &s;hew your&s;elf a brave fellow by giving me fair play."</Q> In&s;en&s;ible to the humanity and mildne&s;s of this addre&s;s, the other, with a &s;avage ferocity, bade him take his ground, for he &s;hould give his hand to no &s;uch vagabond as he was.</P>
<P>The temper of our hero, milky as it was, could ill brook this aggravating in&s;ult: the colour mounted to his cheeks, his &s;pirit &s;parkled in his eyes, and darting a contemp|tuous look at his antagoni&s;t, he &s;ilently &s;tept back to his ground, and po&s;ting him&s;elf in the centre of the ring, with clenched fi&s;ts, braced mu&s;cles, and frowning brow, the juve|nile athletic, terrible in his beauty, pre&s;ented to the &s;ight of the &s;urrounding ru&s;tics a figure and attitude, which the &s;tatuaries of Greece, in the brighte&s;t aera of the art, might have been emulous to &s;tudy.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="119">The on&s;et now began, which was to bring the conte&s;t between brutal &s;trength and &s;kill|ful agility to an i&s;&s;ue. The &s;turdy blows of the miller, which &s;eemed to menace his op|ponent with extinction, were &s;o artfully warded that they &s;erved no other purpo&s;e, but to wa&s;te his &s;trength and exhau&s;t his breath. Furious and implacable in his rage, he &s;till continued to advance, and pre&s;s upon his more wary antagoni&s;t; till Henry, who kept a &s;teady eye upon every movement of his foe, no &s;ooner &s;pied an opening, than he &s;prung within his guard, and with a blow, which &s;eemed to have the force, as well as &s;wiftne&s;s, of lightning, laid him pro&s;trate on the turf. Bow&s;ey leapt upright and &s;mote his hands for joy: the ho&s;tile phalanx gave a groan, whil&s;t their fallen champion was &s;lowly rai&s;ed from the ground by his &s;econds. Had not Henry's patience been urged by the in&s;ult above related, it may well be doubted if he would have plied his advantage either &s;o forcibly, or in a part &s;o &s;en&s;ible to injury as the throat; but repeated provocations had rou&s;ed a &s;pirit, which could hardly be &s;aid to have a tincture of gall, and he now contemplated his fallen foe with pity and regret.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="120">The miller, however, did not keep him long in painful &s;u&s;pence; the blood, which flowed freely from his no&s;trils, by the violence of the &s;hock upon the ground, relieved him from the &s;tupor that at fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his &s;en&s;es, and by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his &s;econds he was again upon his legs, and in a po&s;ture to renew the battle; but &s;o mi&s;erably cre&s;t-fallen was this vaunting braggart, and &s;o confu&s;ed and off his guard, that the generous victor, though re|peatedly urged by Bow&s;ey to follow up his ad|vantage, would not avail him&s;elf of it to the utmo&s;t; &s;o thoroughly was his re&s;entment allayed, that he warned him more than once to keep a better guard, or give over fighting: and now not only Weevil's &s;econds, but his whole party, grew outrageous, and kept no order in the ring, thronging round the com|batants, and &s;houldering Henry in a mo&s;t un|fair and riotous manner. It therefore became nece&s;&s;ary for him, in &s;elf pre&s;ervation, to make a &s;hort battle of it, and a &s;econd blow, placed centrically between the eyes, laid his adver&s;ary a &s;econd time at his length upon the ground, totally di&s;qualified for another on&s;et.</P>
<P>An uproar of voices now en&s;ued, &s;ome run|ning to the beaten party, whil&s;t others were
<PB N="115" REF="121">
laying about them with their &s;ticks, and would probably have demoli&s;hed both the conqueror and his &s;econd, had not peace been pro|claimed by the authority of the wor&s;hipful Ju&s;tice Blachford, attended by his &s;econd, the con&s;table, who in&s;tantly proceeded to fulfil his orders, by arre&s;ting the only innocent per&s;on in the affray, dragging Henry to the &s;tocks, who, being &s;prinkled with a pretty large portion of the miller's blood, and &s;urpri&s;ed in the very act of knocking him down, might have bia&s;&s;ed the judgment of a more equitable magi&s;trate than he had now to deal with.</P>
<P>Bow&s;ey, being an old offender and a bold talker again&s;t Blachford, was &s;entenced al&s;o to the &s;ame place of durance with his principal, though he made many efforts to a&s;&s;ert his in|nocence, which his wor&s;hip lent no ear to, delivering him over to his &s;entence with the voice of authority, whil&s;t he went growling, like a bear to a &s;take, amid&s;t the hi&s;&s;es and hootings of the whole village mob, who were there a&s;&s;embled.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER III. A Story gains by telling.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is not a mini&s;ter of &s;tate, gene|ral, or potentate upon earth, who keeps &s;o many couriers, or employs them &s;o much, as a certain bu&s;y body called <HI>Fame:</HI> to all quarters of the compa&s;s her emi&s;&s;aries fly at one and the &s;ame in&s;tant; there is no &s;top with them for the penning of di&s;patches; they want no written evidence of the news they carry, but away they po&s;t with word-of-mouth intelligence, which gathers as it goes, every tongue that repeats it adding, &s;omething to the tale, till &s;uch a clu&s;ter of fal&s;hoods are wound and woven round one &s;mall atom of original truth, that you may as &s;oon find a grain of wheat in a bu&s;hel of chaff, as &s;earch for fact among&s;t the fictions that envelope it. It was however &s;o &s;hort a &s;tage from the village-green to the hou&s;e of Zachary, that the cou|rier, who came po&s;t with the tidings of Henry's fight, had &s;o little time for his invention to work in, that he had done little or nothing to the improvement of the truth, except killing
<PB N="117" REF="123">
the miller, and &s;ending Henry to pri&s;on in fet|ters for the murder.</P>
<P>With the&s;e &s;light advantages in point of effect the &s;tory found its way to the ears of Alexander Kinloch, ju&s;t as he was in the act of puni&s;hing the &s;ins and offences of a rotten grinder in the jaw-bone of a patient, by lug|ging out its guiltle&s;s neighbour, which being &s;ound and &s;trong, and an u&s;eful &s;ervant withal, came &s;o unwillingly out of his &s;ocket, that he brought part of it away with him as a proof of his attachment to his duty.</P>
<P>Alexander had a gift of fore&s;eeing things after they had come to pa&s;s, which I take to be a true definition of the <HI>&s;econd &s;ight</HI>; he there|fore heard the tidings of Henry's fate with no other remark, than that he thought how it would be; but as the operation he was en|gaged in was a work of charity, and the pa|tient of cour&s;e not entitled to a grievance, he left him to reconcile him&s;elf to the mi&s;take as he could, and retired into the kitchen, where old Bridget was occupied in her culi|nary concerns.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Here's a pretty kettle of fi&s;h, o' my con&s;cience,"</Q> cried Alexander, as he entered the kitchen.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"What's the matter with the

<P>This was one more &s;ecret in Su&s;an's bag than Jemima was aware of: for a &s;hort &s;pace her confu&s;ion robbed her of words; &s;he even debated within her&s;elf whether &s;he would not

<P>As &s;he approached the town-green, where the tale-bearer had painted the horrid &s;pecta|cle of the murdered man &s;tretched on the earth, and &s;urrounded by his weeping friends, her knees trembled under her, her heart palpi|tated, and her breath was lo&s;t: with difficulty &s;he reached the dreaded &s;pot, and eagerly ca&s;t her eyes around; but all was &s;olitude and &s;i|lence; the crowd had di&s;per&s;ed, the &s;tocks were not within view, and nobody was &s;tirring on the green: the pro&s;pect was au&s;picious to her hopes; the improbability of Bridget's re|port became more glaring, and her &s;pirits gathered &s;trength to &s;upport her on her way to the hou&s;e of the Ju&s;tice, where &s;he a&s;&s;ured

<P>WE now return to Henry, whom we left in a &s;ituation of &s;ecurity again&s;t e&s;cape, be|ing fa&s;t locked by the leg, and &s;ide by &s;ide with his partner in affliction, Bow&s;ey; companions as ill matched as ever fortune brought together in the &s;ame predicament. Henry, all patience, unmoved by the mockeries and gibings of the mob, calm and collected; Bow&s;ey, full of ran|cour and revenge, in &s;ullen &s;ilence brooding on the horrid thoughts of robbery and murder, in&s;pired into his mind not only by the menaces of Weevil, but by the &s;ight of the money, which he o&s;tentatiou&s;ly di&s;played upon the challenge; at length, after a long meditation, turning a look, in which every evil pa&s;&s;ion was expre&s;&s;ed, upon his partner in di&s;grace, he be|gan

to vent him&s;elf in the following manner:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"A pretty &s;on of a b&mdash;ch of a ju&s;tice, to lay us by the heels in this fa&s;hion for nothing at all!

If you will put up with &s;uch things, I will not; I know him for a pitiful peaching ra&s;cal; that fellow has the &s;pite of the devil in him; if he could, he would hang a man for only taking a gudgeon out of the water; a knave that goes prowling and lurching about all night to pick up informations for the ju&s;|tice, and that makes him &s;uch a favourite, for|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, with his wor&s;hip; but I'll favourite him if I catch him; I &s;hould think no more &s;in and &s;hame of knocking him on the head, than I &s;hould in &s;hooting a mad dog; for why? every body will allow that an informer is the vile&s;t of wretches, and that it is as good a deed as to drink, to put &s;uch a villain out of the world.</Q></P>

If the fi&s;h of the &s;tream are private property, (which is more than I know) you perhaps knew better, and had no right to take them; in that ca&s;e it was a robbery, and you &s;ubjected your&s;elf to being puni&s;hed as a pilferer and a thief.

<P><Q REND="inline">"Damn you for a puritanical preaching &s;on of a b&mdash;ch,"</Q> cried Bow&s;ey, in a rage; <Q REND="inline">"is this your way of treating the only friend that &s;tood by you, when no &s;oul was on your &s;ide?

Who drew me into this premunire but your&s;elf, and your cur&s;t, &s;neaking, half-begotten quarrel, when I &s;tood forth on your &s;ide, and made you fight it out like a gentleman? Who provok'd that thief of a miller to vent his &s;pite upon me, and to threaten me with informations, but your&s;elf? Didn't the blu&s;tering ra&s;cal draw out his pur&s;e in my very face, and throw it full of gold and &s;ilver on the table, purpo&s;ely to vapour over me with his riches, and to &s;hew me and every body el&s;e what he got by his pitiful trade of informing?

<P>This dialogue would probably have been kept up &s;ome time longer, had it not been cut &s;hort by the intervention of a re&s;cue in the per&s;on of the con&s;table, accompanied by Su&s;an, who came running out of breath to Henry, with the joyful tidings of his in&s;tant liberation. That generous youth had no &s;ooner heard &s;entence of emancipation pronounced in his favour, and under&s;tood that it was not to extend to his fellow pri&s;oner, than he ab&s;olutely prote&s;ted again&s;t availing him&s;elf of it upon &s;uch partial terms. The con&s;table &s;tared with a&s;toni&s;h|ment, and declared it to be a new ca&s;e; that his powers extended no further than to the per&s;on of Henry; and that there mu&s;t be a fre&s;h ap|plication made to the ju&s;tice, if he per&s;i&s;ted in &s;o unnatural a re&s;olution.</P>

<P>Su&s;an turned a&s;ide to wipe away a tear, and at the &s;ame time Ju&s;tice Blachford appeared in view on the other &s;ide of the green; for the &s;tocks were &s;o &s;ituated as to have the green in view, though not di&s;coverable by Su&s;an in her way to the Ju&s;tice's hou&s;e.

it, &s;o that &s;he in&s;tantly &s;et forth in pur|&s;uit of Blachford, to make a &s;econd effort on his heart, and fini&s;h the good work &s;he had as yet but half accompli&s;hed. Whether &s;he was indebt|ed to his wor&s;hip's humanity, or to her own ad|dre&s;s, for the ea&s;e with which &s;he now obtained her &s;uit for the relea&s;e of both parties, we &s;hall not at pre&s;ent divulge, but certain it is, that Henry's point of honour in &s;tickling for his companion's relea&s;e was, by circum&s;tances which thereafter happened, employed as one among&s;t many rea&s;ons for involving him in the &s;evere&s;t trial innocence could be expo&s;ed to.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Bow&s;ey was &s;et free, he reached his hand to Henry, gave him a hearty &s;hake, and prote&s;ted aloud with an oath, that he was a brave fellow, and &s;taunch to his friend; add|ing, that he would &s;tand by him to the la&s;t drop of his blood, and if he had &s;aid any thing to the contrary in his pa&s;&s;ion, he was now con|vinced of his error, and was &s;orry for it; then tucking his cudgel under his arm, without a word to any other per&s;on pre&s;ent, &s;ilently marched away; the con&s;table, with a &s;igni|ficant &s;hake of his head, muttering &s;omething to him&s;elf about evil company and the gallows, which &s;eemed pointed equally at the party ab&s;ent and the party pre&s;ent.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="138">There was a di&s;order in Su&s;an's per&s;on and deportment that could not e&s;cape the notice of Henry; her dre&s;s di&s;hevelled, her cheek flu&s;h|ed, her eyes red and &s;woln, every thing be|&s;poke the trepidation of her mind. Impatient to be informed of Henry's real &s;ituation, &s;he found occa&s;ion to put &s;ome que&s;tions to him in a whi&s;per (for the crowd was now collecting about them) relative to his treatment of young Weevil; but what was her a&s;toni&s;hment when &s;he heard the truth expounded to her in a few words, and under&s;tood how gro&s;sly the affair had been exaggerated, not only by Kinloch and Bridget, but no le&s;s &s;o by Blachford him|&s;elf, who had &s;et it forth to her in mo&s;t dark and di&s;mal colours: <Q REND="inline">"Oh! the villain! the ba&s;e treacherous villain!"</Q> &s;he exclaimed with up|lifted hands and eyes. But now the villagers had got round them in con&s;iderable numbers, and kept a watchful eye upon every motion of Su&s;an, who&s;e anxiety for Henry's liberation had rou&s;ed both their curio&s;ity and &s;u&s;picion; for as this girl was a poor woman's daugh|ter of the &s;ame pari&s;h, and had been rai&s;ed from a very lowly &s;tation to &s;uch an one, as enabled her to &s;et off a very pretty form in &s;mart and elegant apparel, &s;he had many
<PB N="133" REF="139">
enviers among&s;t her own &s;ex, who were ready prepared to let loo&s;e the venom of their tongues upon her. This was well under&s;tood by Henry, who re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to di&s;|appoint their malice, and therefore kept &s;uch a guard over his behaviour towards his bene|factre&s;s, as &s;hould afford no grounds for their cen&s;ure. He therefore declined her invitation to her mother's cottage, and would not enter into any private conver&s;ation, notwith&s;tanding all her hints and contrivances for drawing him a&s;ide, contenting him&s;elf with general expre&s;|&s;ions of thankfulne&s;s, which he took care &s;hould be heard by all about him; and though the prudence of this re&s;erve did not meet the warmth of Su&s;an's heart, yet it was well cal|culated to &s;ave her from the taunts of her neighbours: awed as &s;he was by the di&s;tance of his behaviour, knowing withal the firmne&s;s of his re&s;olutions, &s;he &s;uffered him to leave her without any other effort to detain him than what was expre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ilent &s;orrows of the eyes.</P>
<P>He was now once more ca&s;t upon the world a helple&s;s &s;olitary wanderer, not know|ing whither to direct his &s;teps, nor where to re&s;ort for a livelihood by the labour of his
<PB N="134" REF="140">
hands. A &s;tranger to the country, he knew no road, but that he had pa&s;&s;ed over to and from the town where Doctor Cawdle had hired him. Re&s;olute to remain no longer in the hou&s;e with Jemima, he was no le&s;s deter|mined not to expo&s;e the rea&s;ons he had for quitting it. To the neighbouring market-town he therefore propo&s;ed to bend his cour&s;e; from thence he could write a few lines to his ma&s;ter, by way of farewel, and in thankful|ne&s;s for his favours; there al&s;o he had hopes of falling in with &s;ome recruiting party in which he might enli&s;t. The pittance he had in his pocket did not promi&s;e him any long &s;upport, yet it &s;ufficed to keep immediate di&s;|tre&s;s out of &s;ight.</P>
<P>As Zachary's hou&s;e was by the road &s;ide, he took a circuit through the fields, at the back of it, and as he was on his way, chance (whether good or ill, time may reveal) threw him upon the very &s;pot, where Su&s;an was &s;itting at the root of a tree, in a mo&s;t &s;olitary place and di&s;con&s;olate attitude, giving vent to her tears, and meditating upon the very ob|ject who now &s;tood before her.</P>
<P>Henry well knew the intere&s;t he had in her thoughts; and tho&s;e rea&s;ons that would have
<PB N="135" REF="141">
led a man of le&s;s delicate principles to throw him&s;elf in her way, operated upon him for avoiding her. In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, this was impo&s;&s;ible; &s;urpri&s;ed into an interview, and in a place where their conference &s;eemed &s;e|cure from ob&s;ervation, he neither attempted, nor probably had at that moment a wi&s;h to e&s;cape from her.</P>

My education has not train'd me to any art or handicraft: I have &s;trength indeed for daily labour, but I am a &s;tranger to the practice of it: I can neither weild a flail, nor hold the plough. I have pa&s;s'd my days in &s;uch tranquillity and retirement from the world, that every &s;cene of active life, much more every trial of adver&s;ity, is new to me, and &s;trange.

<HEAD>CHAPTER VI. He that won't take Caution, mu&s;t take Con&s;equences.</HEAD>
<P>WHILST Henry was following a foot-path acro&s;s the enclo&s;ures that led him the way which the miller and his comrades had taken, he &s;aw a man at &s;ome di&s;tance, whom he perceived to be his friend Bow&s;ey, loitering about the &s;ide of a coppice; the &s;ight of him in &s;uch a place, and certain &s;ymptoms that be|trayed no good de&s;ign, brought to Henry's recollection the menaces he had reproved him for venting again&s;t Weevil, when they were fellow-pri&s;oners in the &s;tocks. He kept his eye upon him till he &s;aw him creep into the wood, and he then bethought him&s;elf that it might not be an unnece&s;&s;ary precaution to fur|ni&s;h him&s;elf with &s;ome weapon of defence, in ca&s;e he &s;hould fall in either with Bow&s;ey
<PB N="146" REF="152">
or the ho&s;tile party, for his &s;u&s;picions of his former friend were now become not le&s;s un|favourable than what he entertained of his avowed enemies. With this intent he had &s;ingled a &s;tout &s;tem of a crab-tree in the hedge; but upon applying to his pocket for his knife to cut it off, he recollected with much regret that he had entru&s;ted it to Bow&s;ey's keeping, and had forgotten to demand it of him after the fight was over. This knife had been the gift of a friend; a plate of &s;ilver was inlaid upon the heft, and the word <HI>Henry</HI> at full length engraved upon it. It was furni&s;hed with a long and pointed blade, and was as formidable a weapon in the hand of a villain as a villain could de&s;ire. He had every rea&s;on to wi&s;h it back again in his own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and therefore took the &s;traite&s;t cour&s;e towards the gap in the coppice, where he had ob&s;erved Bow&s;ey to enter.</P>
<P>In the way thither, and when he had ap|proached near the place, where a narrow path led to a &s;tile at the entrance of the coppice, he chanced upon young Weevil, the miller, who had parted from his comrades and was on his way to the mill, which laid not many furlongs on the other &s;ide of the coppice in que&s;tion.
<PB N="147" REF="153">
Henry, ob&s;erving that his head was bound about with a handkerchief, very civilly en|quired after his hurt, expre&s;&s;ing his regret for the &s;evere blow he had dealt him, prote&s;t|ing that he had not &s;truck in malice or with an intent to maim him. A &s;hort and &s;urly an&s;wer was all that Henry gained by this friendly addre&s;s; yet he proceeded to caution Weevil again&s;t Bow&s;ey, and to give him &s;ome intimations of what had e&s;caped from that re|vengeful fellow, whil&s;t he was &s;itting by him in the &s;tocks: he told him that he verily be|lieved he harboured mi&s;chief in his heart again&s;t him, that he had &s;een him prowling about the &s;kirts of the wood, that he had entered it a few minutes before over the &s;tile which Weevil had to pa&s;s; and as he knew him to be armed with a dangerous weapon, he recommended to him either to go home by another way, or to accept of him as a companion through the coppice.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Accept of you!"</Q> cried the miller, <Q REND="inline">"no, truly I want no &s;uch &s;curvy companion to go with me: keep your di&s;tance, and let me have none of your cant, for I don't believe there is the value of a rope's end to choo&s;e

between your friend and you; therefore march off, if you plea&s;e, take your own cour&s;e, and leave me to follow mine: one at a time, and I fear neither of you; but before I pa&s;s this &s;tile, let me &s;ee you out of reach, and I'll &s;tand to con&s;equences for what may follow."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Go your way, then,"</Q> replied Henry, <Q REND="inline">"for I &s;ee you are incorrigible; only remember I have given you warning, and am clear in con|&s;cience."</Q> This &s;aid, he turned a&s;ide, and was out of &s;ight in a minute.</P>
<P>Weevil pau&s;ed a while, then, gra&s;ping his cudgel, nimbly vaulted over the &s;tile and en|tered the coppice. A narrow winding path led through the underwood, which was thick and over-grown, &s;o as to make his pa&s;&s;age &s;omewhat difficult; when, as he was putting a&s;ide the hazel-boughs with his hand, a vio|lent &s;troke on the head brought him in&s;tantly to the ground: it was from the hand of the vil|lain Bow&s;ey, who in the &s;ame moment &s;pring|ing upon him, and making a thru&s;t at him with his knife, began to rifle him of the can|vas bag, which he had &s;o idly di&s;played in the ale-hou&s;e, and which was probably the chief in|centive to the murderous a&s;&s;ault, though it mu&s;t
<PB N="149" REF="155">
be owned the rancour of the wretch's heart was black enough, without a provocative, to under|take any infamous act of malice and revenge.</P>
<P>Henry, in the mean time, whom the &s;ul|lenne&s;s of Weevil's manners could not dive&s;t of anxiety for his life, heard the &s;troke as he was &s;till hovering near the &s;pot, for his mind au|gured mi&s;chief. Without a moment's he&s;ita|tion he ru&s;hed into the coppice, and forcing his way through it with a rapidity no ob&s;tacles could impede, unarmed as he was, leapt &s;ud|denly upon the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, &s;eizing him by the throat with one hand, whil&s;t with the other he wrenched the bloody knife out of his gra&s;p, which, together with the canvas bag, and the money it contained, fell upon the ground. Apprehen&s;ive that the robber might recover the knife, he took occa&s;ion in the &s;truggle to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of it again; but whil&s;t he was &s;tooping for this purpo&s;e, one hand only being employed in holding Bow&s;ey, the &s;turdy vil|lain &s;eized the moment for e&s;cape, and with a &s;udden jerk extricated him&s;elf from his hold, and fled for life. The exertion Bow&s;ey had made in getting loo&s;e was &s;o violent as to cau&s;e Henry to &s;tep back &s;ome paces, who, in his &s;truggle to keep his legs, received &s;o
<PB N="150" REF="156">
&s;evere a &s;prain in his ancle, that he became incapable of pur&s;uing him. Sick and pale as a&s;hes with the acutene&s;s of the pain, he &s;tood &s;till to recover him&s;elf; a faint cold &s;weat bur&s;t out all over him; at his feet lay the body of Weevil, apparently without life, and bleed|ing from the &s;ide, where the &s;tab had been given him; in the hand of Henry was the bloody knife, and upon the ground the can|vas bag; the pockets of the plundered man were rifled, and turned in&s;ide out.</P>
<P>In this &s;u&s;picious po&s;ture, and at this very moment, almo&s;t fainting with what he &s;uffered, and horror-&s;truck with what he looked upon, our ill-&s;tarr'd hero found him&s;elf on the &s;ud|den violently &s;eized by the whole party whom he had fir&s;t de&s;cried in Weevil's company, and who now, with one voice, pronounced him guilty of the horrid act. The vehemence with which they &s;prung upon him brought him to the ground, and in his fall gave him &s;uch intolerable angui&s;h, that had they been di&s;po&s;ed to li&s;ten to his defence, which they were not, he was in no capacity of making it. At length, however, he &s;ummoned &s;trength and re&s;olution enough to tell them in few words that his hurt was got in the defence,
<PB N="151" REF="157">
and not in the a&s;&s;ault of the wounded man; that Bow&s;ey was the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, and, pointing to the way by which he had run off, earne&s;tly recommended them to &s;et out in pur&s;uit of him.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"You are in the right of that,"</Q> quoth one of them, <Q REND="inline">"for then you will be off, and &s;o we &s;hall lo&s;e you both; as for your &s;prain'd ancle, I take it to be a mere &s;ham, &s;o get up, and come along with us to the Ju&s;tice's."</Q> This &s;aid, they rai&s;ed him on his feet; and now it mu&s;t be confe&s;t the figure he exhibited, &s;prinkled with the blood of the wounded man, the fatal knife in his hand, and his looks gha&s;tly and full of horror, was &s;uch as might fairly have &s;taggered minds more equitably di&s;po&s;ed than their's. They had &s;een him fighting with Weevil, and it was on all hands concluded that malice and revenge had &s;purred him on, jointly with Bow&s;ey, to perpetrate the bloody deed. Nobody, however, thought of &s;tirring a &s;tep in pur&s;uit of Bow&s;ey; con|tented with their capture, they held him fa&s;t, whil&s;t one ran to the mill with the di&s;mal tidings, and all &s;eemed to forget that any at|tention was to be given to poor Weevil, who to all appearance &s;eemed to be in a &s;tate that needed little other &s;ervice than that of burial.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VII. A Man may be led to act mercifully upon evil Motives.</HEAD>
<P>ROBERT Blachford, E&s;quire, who has al|ready been &s;lightly introduced to our readers, was proprietor of a &s;mall e&s;tate in the village where he re&s;ided, which he had lately purcha&s;ed of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;urvivor of a family, very antient in the county, and once very re&s;pectable. He was rich in money, clo&s;e in his oeconomy, and unencumbered with wife or relations: in his genealogy he was not to be traced any otherwi&s;e than by conjec|ture,
<PB N="153" REF="159">
it being natural to &s;uppo&s;e that he had a father, grandfather, and &s;o upwards, through as many generations as his neighbours, who had kept a better account of them: All that the world in general knew of him was, that he had made a fortune in the i&s;land of Jamaica from a very abject &s;tation in &s;ociety, and that his familiars in that quarter of the globe pretty generally complimented him with the &s;tile and title of <HI>Bloody Bob Blachford.</HI></P>
<P>He was now perhaps fifty years of age or more, of a &s;tout athletic make, with a &s;warthy atrabilious complexion, &s;trongly leaning to|wards the ca&s;t of the mulatto, with all his pa&s;&s;ions hot and fiery as indulgence could make them, cunning and &s;elf-intere&s;ted, fawn|ing to his &s;uperiors, arbitrary over tho&s;e he could oppre&s;s, unforgiving and unfeeling. As neither his manners nor morals &s;poke much in his favour, he had been little noticed by any of the neighbouring gentry, till in a recent conte&s;t for the county he became &s;o active an agent for the candidate he e&s;pous'd, and there|by recommended him&s;elf &s;o effectually to the leading friends of the party, that he ob|tained the honour of having the name of Robert Blachford, E&s;quire, in&s;erted in the com|mi&s;&s;ion

<P>Before we pre&s;ent our hero at the tribunal of this wor&s;hipful di&s;tributor of ju&s;tice, among&s;t who&s;e failings certainly weak pity had no place, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to account for a &s;eeming contradiction to this remark, exemplified in his late treatment of our afore|&s;aid hero, who had e&s;caped out of his hands with a much &s;lighter cha&s;ti&s;ement, than could be expected from &s;o rigorous a magi&s;trate: but though mercy was not predominant in the heart of Blachford, there was a certain pa&s;&s;ion in that region, which we cannot dig|nify by the name of love, and will not &s;tain our page by affixing to it the real title which it merits. Now this pa&s;&s;ion had a great deal to &s;ay in the cabinet councils of Blachford's bo&s;om; it could very ea&s;ily make him re&s;ort to every &s;pecies of treachery to compa&s;s it's indulgence; it could even untie his pur&s;e-&s;trings in &s;ome ca&s;es, where nothing el&s;e would ferve the turn, and now and then (as in the in&s;tance alluded to) has been known to put a violence on his nature, by forcing him into
<PB N="155" REF="161">
mea&s;ures that had an outward re&s;emblance to charity and forgivene&s;s.</P>
<P>Su&s;an May, as we have before hinted, was eminently endowed with tho&s;e powers and ca|pacities, that are requi&s;ite to put the afore&s;aid namele&s;s pa&s;&s;ion of Blachford's into a &s;tate of high activity and efferve&s;cence; &s;he had al&s;o, as our readers mu&s;t have di&s;covered, a large portion of benevolence, and though this was a pleader, &s;ingly con&s;idered, that he would have turned a deaf ear to from the bench, yet when &s;econded by beauty like her's, it could convert a de&s;perate cau&s;e into a good one. Blachford had &s;een Henry, as our hi&s;|tory has related, and neither from the &s;urvey of his per&s;on, nor from the circum&s;tances of the interview, had he received any &s;uch im|pre&s;&s;ions as were likely to favour a &s;uit un|dertaken in his behalf; when Su&s;an, therefore, betrayed &s;uch anxiety and &s;olicitude for his &s;ake, and earne&s;tly demanded a relea&s;e from the ignominious confinement he was in, the Ju&s;tice held the balance between two op|po&s;ing pa&s;&s;ions with &s;o even a hand, that it was for a long while doubtful whether her charms or his jealou&s;y would turn the &s;cale. Nothing could &s;o gall his pride, as her zealous impor|tunity
<PB N="156" REF="162">
for a rival whom he dreaded and ab|horred, but the terror &s;he was in for his &s;afety added &s;uch expre&s;&s;ion to her features, that though they hurt her argument they advanced her &s;uit. Blachford painted the ca&s;e in &s;uch aggravated colours, as alarmed her to the height; and as he took care to in&s;inuate that no hand but his could &s;natch her favourite object from his danger, the in&s;idious villain &s;ecured to him&s;elf an intere&s;t from her fears, that his whole fortune perhaps could not have purcha&s;ed from her favours. The bribe of re&s;cuing her beloved Henry, was the only bribe &s;he could not re&s;olutely with&s;tand. Blachford &s;tated that the life of Weevil was in danger, that it was his duty as a magi&s;trate to keep the a&s;&s;ailant in &s;afe hold, and he mu&s;t ab&s;olutely commit him to pri&s;on, there to abide the i&s;&s;ue; that to gratify her partiality for a worthle&s;s fellow, by letting him loo&s;e upon &s;ociety, would be a &s;tretch of power on his part, that would put his reputation to ri&s;que, and perhaps be attended with very &s;erious con&s;equences; neverthele&s;s, he was ready to run all hazards for her &s;ake, could he but find her di&s;po&s;ed to make any return on her part for &s;uch &s;ervices. To this &s;he
<PB N="157" REF="163">
replied, that all the return in her power to make was gratitude; and of this he might be a&s;&s;ured, &s;he would never fail to bear his favour in remembrance.</P>
<P>Gratitude, he ob&s;erved to her, was &s;o mere a burden to a generous mind, that &s;he would do well to avail her&s;elf of the power &s;he had to balance the account at once by favours, which he had long &s;olicited in vain, though he had &s;trove to merit them by con&s;tant at|tention to her, and frequent gratuities to her indigent mother. To this &s;he replied, with proper &s;pirit, that &s;he was per&s;uaded, if her mother, poor as &s;he was, could &s;u&s;pect his kindne&s;s to her was only a cover for de&s;igns upon her daughter, &s;he would &s;purn &s;uch favours, and de&s;pi&s;e him for his ba&s;ene&s;s; add|ing, that &s;he was no le&s;s &s;ure, that &s;uch wou'd be the &s;entiments of the unhappy youth now in his power, did he &s;u&s;pect that his &s;afety was to be purcha&s;ed by the &s;acrifice of her per&s;on.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Then keep your per&s;on,"</Q> cried Blach|ford &s;ullenly, <Q REND="inline">"and let him keep his pri&s;on: let him rot, &s;tarve, and peri&s;h in his &s;traw!"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Oh horrible!"</Q> &s;he exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"what ter|rors do you give me! mu&s;t he &s;uffer this,

<P>Here he began to make certain familiar overtures, which &s;he put a&s;ide, &s;aying in a per|emptory tone, <Q REND="inline">"Set your pri&s;oner free in the fir&s;t place; give immediate orders for his relea&s;e, and let me &s;ee him &s;afe and at liberty; 'tis the only favour you can grant me."</Q>&mdash;With this &s;he turned from him as if to leave the room, when Blachford nimbly interpo&s;ed, and bolting the door, caught her with a ferocious kind of extacy in his arms; the manner of it more re|&s;embled the a&s;&s;ault of a ruffian than the care&s;&s;es of a lover; his age, his per&s;on, his black and mercile&s;s vi&s;age were calculated to in&s;pire terror and di&s;gu&s;t: &s;uch was the effect they had upon the pre&s;ent object of his de&s;ires, who in&s;tantly &s;et up a &s;cream &s;o loud and &s;hrill, that it echoed
<PB N="159" REF="165">
through the hou&s;e. Had the &s;cene of this rencontre been a &s;olitude, Blachford's courage would mo&s;t probably have been proof again&s;t the outcry; but &s;ituated as he now was, in the mid&s;t of habitations, with the cottage of Su&s;an's mother near adjoining, the alarm became &s;e|rious, and to per&s;i&s;t was to expo&s;e him&s;elf to public di&s;grace. Frighted for his reputation, though in principle unreformed, he in&s;tantly let loo&s;e his victim, and fell to entreaties and apologies, begging her to be &s;ilent, and pro|mi&s;ing to comply with her reque&s;t on the &s;pot, if &s;he would only a&s;&s;ure him of keeping &s;ecret what had pa&s;&s;ed. There was enough in Su&s;an's keeping, of which the reader &s;hall hereafter be informed, be&s;ides this affair, to have put his re|putation, if not his life, at her mercy; we need not wonder therefore if he was glad to &s;eal a peace, and &s;end the con&s;table to relea&s;e his pri&s;oner in the manner already related.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VIII. Innocence may, by Circum&s;tances, a&s;&s;ume the Appearance of Guilt.</HEAD>
<P>TO the wor&s;hipful per&s;onage, whom we have been de&s;cribing, our hero was now carried, and arraigned by the joint evidence of all who had been pre&s;ent at his &s;eizure. The knife was produced, which, upon interrogation, he acknowledged to be his property, &s;tamped with his name. The canvas pur&s;e was ex|hibited, which the witne&s;&s;es te&s;tified to have been taken by Weevil out of his pocket in the ale-hou&s;e kitchen in pre&s;ence of the pri&s;oner, and its contents di&s;played upon the table. The quarrel he had had with the wounded man was notorious to the whole village, and the language Bow&s;ey had addre&s;&s;ed to him upon their being freed from the &s;tocks, was perfect|ly well remembered: the very attitude, in which he was di&s;covered, &s;tanding over the body, &s;prinkled with blood, pale and gha&s;tly, and confu&s;ed, with every other circum&s;tance that could corroborate &s;u&s;picion, were &s;tated and de&s;cribed. It was not denied but that
<PB N="161" REF="167">
Bow&s;ey's di&s;appearance made it highly pro|bable he was an accomplice in the act, which was the rather credited from the conver&s;ation above alluded to; and orders were in con&s;e|quence given for a pur&s;uit, which however were better heard than obeyed, &s;everal per&s;ons undertaking it, but none &s;etting out upon the errand.</P>
<P>Hitherto the pri&s;oner had not oppo&s;ed a word to the cea&s;ele&s;s torrent of accu&s;ation, that had been poured upon him. The clerk had been bu&s;ied in minuting down the depo&s;i|tions, and the Ju&s;tice was preparing to make out his commitment; when, taking up the knife, and &s;hewing it to the pri&s;oner, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"You acknowledge this knife to be your pro|perty?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I do,"</Q> replied Henry&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"And with this knife the &s;tab was given to the unhappy man, who&s;e life has probably been &s;acrificed thereby&mdash;With that very knife the deed was done, but not by my hand."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I under&s;tand you,"</Q> &s;aid the Ju&s;tice, <Q REND="inline">"but for that we &s;hall not take your word; he that does not &s;cruple to commit a murder, will not he&s;itate to ad|vance a fal&s;ehood in his defence."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"True,"</Q> replied Henry; <Q REND="inline">"but if the wounded man is alive and in his &s;en&s;es, I refer my&s;elf to him;
<PB N="162" REF="168">
let him be my witne&s;s, I have none other, ex|cept my con&s;cience and my God."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Mighty well,</Q> cried the Ju&s;tice; <Q REND="inline">"that we &s;hall enquire into hereafter."</Q>&mdash;Here &s;everal voices cried out that the man was dead, others &s;aid he was in|&s;en&s;ible, but nobody was di&s;patched to make enquiry.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Your chri&s;tian name, I perceive,"</Q> quoth the Ju&s;tice, <Q REND="inline">"is engraved upon the knife-handle; and what other name do you an&s;wer to?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I beg leave to decline an&s;wering that que&s;tion,"</Q> replied the pri&s;oner. <Q REND="inline">"How!"</Q> ex|claimed Blachford with a voice of authority, <Q REND="inline">"not tell your name, fellow! I wou'd have you to know the law will force you to declare it; the thumb-&s;crew will wring it from you. Hark'ye, clerk, turn to the book, and tell this contumacious fellow what the &s;tatute enacts in the ca&s;e of not declaring his name."</Q> The clerk now whi&s;pered his wor&s;hip, and probably in|formed him that there was no provi&s;ion to en|force an ab&s;olute declaration of his name. The Ju&s;tice next demanded the condition of his parents, where he was born, and to what place he belonged?&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Tho&s;e que&s;tions,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t in like manner decline, for no torture can force me to di&s;clo&s;e what I do not know."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Heyday!"</Q> cried the Ju&s;tice, <Q REND="inline">"you
<PB N="163" REF="169">
do not know who were your parents, nor where you was born, nor what place you belong to?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I told your wor&s;hip,"</Q> &s;aid one who was the chief &s;poke&s;man of the party who apprehended him, <Q REND="inline">"that he was a vagabond and a no-nation ra&s;cal, when I informed again&s;t him for his a&s;&s;ault upon poor Tom Weevil on the Town-Green; he wou'd then have murder'd him, had not your wor&s;hip &s;tept in as you did: I wi&s;h to Heaven, when you had him in the &s;tocks, you had kept him there, and not have let that wench Sukey May, who is no better than &s;he &s;hou'd be, have prevailed upon you to relea&s;e him."</Q></P>
<P>The magi&s;trate reddened at this retort, and was evidently di&s;concerted. Henry took the opportunity to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"that he de&s;ir'd that young woman, whom the witne&s;s was pleas'd to de|&s;cribe as no better than &s;he &s;hou'd be, might be &s;ummon'd, as he believ'd &s;he wou'd have &s;omething to depo&s;e in his exculpation, which might tend to &s;olve the appearances that were again&s;t him, and corroborate the defence he was prepar'd to make."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Aye, aye!"</Q> rejoined the afore&s;aid &s;poke&s;|man, <Q REND="inline">"there is no doubt but that hu&s;&s;ey will &s;peak to your character, if &s;he is call'd upon;
<PB N="164" REF="170">
for, plea&s;e your wor&s;hip, I my&s;elf, and the&s;e men with me, &s;aw that very wench and this fellow in clo&s;e quarters together under a hedge, hugging and ki&s;&s;ing after a fine fa&s;hion; &s;o that there is no que&s;tion but what one &s;ays, t'other will &s;wear to; be&s;ides,"</Q> added he, <Q REND="inline">"Sukey May has run away from her &s;ervice and fled the pari&s;h, which, I believe, you will find to be the ca&s;e, if your wor&s;hip thinks fit to en|quire of her late mi&s;tre&s;s, Madam Cawdle."</Q></P>
<P>The Ju&s;tice did not wi&s;h to make any en|quiries of or about Su&s;an May, who probably was the very la&s;t per&s;on living he at this mo|ment wi&s;hed to &s;ee, or even to be named in his hearing; he therefore briefly ob&s;erved to the &s;poke&s;man, that what he had been &s;aying was irrelevant; and turning to the pri&s;oner, demand|ed if he could call any other witne&s;s in his de|fence. <Q REND="inline">"If Thomas Weevil be yet living,"</Q> &s;aid Henry, <Q REND="inline">"I appeal to him; his te&s;timony alone can clear the fact; if he is no more, or incapable of giving evidence, and if Bow&s;ey, the &s;ole perpetrator of the deed, has e&s;caped, I mu&s;t re&s;t my defence upon my own &s;ingle account of the tran&s;action, corroborated, how|ever, by the evidence that Su&s;an May can give of certain circum&s;tances antecedent to it."</Q>&mdash;
<PB N="165" REF="171">
<Q REND="inline">"We have heard enough of tho&s;e certain cir|cum&s;tances,"</Q> quoth the Ju&s;tice&mdash;whereupon, ri&s;ing from his chair with much &s;olemnity, and fixing a &s;tern look upon the pri&s;oner, he de|manded of him what el&s;e he had to offer, before he proceeded to fulfil the duties of his office, by committing him to pri&s;on. <Q REND="inline">"I again de|&s;ire,"</Q> replied Henry, <Q REND="inline">"that re&s;ort may be im|mediately had to the wounded man; providen|tially it may &s;o happen, that neither the blow he received on the head by the bludgeon of the robber, nor the &s;tab in his &s;ide, are mortal, or, if mortal, not &s;o immediate as to di&s;qualify him from performing one act of ju&s;tice before he leaves the world, that of &s;aving the reputation, and perhaps the life, of an innocent man, who has fallen into this peril by &s;tanding forth in his re&s;cue and defence. If I am to be deprived of this appeal, which I hold to be my right, I am &s;till prepared to account for every circum&s;tance that appears to make again&s;t me; and if that fails me, ultimately I am provided again&s;t the wor&s;t that can befall me, for God and my own con&s;cience will acquit me; they are my wit|ne&s;&s;es, and will te&s;tify that I am guiltle&s;s."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"How dare you, impious wretch as you are,"</Q> cried the Ju&s;tice, <Q REND="inline">"to u&s;e the name of

God in my hearing, before whom you &s;tand accu&s;ed of murder, and apprehended in the very act, as I may &s;ay, by the&s;e men, who are credible witne&s;&s;es and depo&s;e again&s;t you? And you truly to talk of con&s;cience! who, if you had &s;uch a thing belonging to you, or any remor&s;e at heart for the heinous crime you have committed, wou'd ere now have made confe&s;&s;ion of your guilt, and invok'd the pu|ni&s;hment it merits, &s;eeing you have no one word to offer in your defence, nor any creature to appeal to but a wretch, who is your ac|complice, and an unhappy girl, whom there is too much rea&s;on to fear you have ruin'd and &s;educ'd, which, though it falls not within the pre&s;ent charge again&s;t you, is a crime that can|not be &s;poken of without horror. And now, having examin'd you touching the felony in que&s;tion, and taken in writing the information of tho&s;e who apprehended you, I &s;hall pro|ceed to commit you to pri&s;on for &s;afe cu&s;tody, the offence of which you are charg'd being of a capital nature, and in which bail is ou&s;ted by &s;tatute: your &s;ureties, therefore, mu&s;t be the four walls of the pri&s;on and none el&s;e: there you mu&s;t lie till the next county a&s;&s;izes, when you &s;hall be arraign'd before the court upon

the inqui&s;ition of the coroner. It now remains that I &s;ay &s;omething to you upon the &s;trong evidence of the circum&s;tances, in which you was apprehended, and of the heinous nature of the act, of which you &s;tand charg'd; and this I &s;hall do the rather, becau&s;e there &s;eems a har|den'd in&s;en&s;ibility and impenitence about you, which are &s;hocking to all here pre&s;ent. The crime of deliberate and wilful murder, whereof you are accus'd, is a crime, from which the heart of man &s;tarts with horror, and revolts, and which throughout the world is puni&s;hed with death. The unhappy object, whom you have &s;ent unprepar'd to his account, was found by the&s;e people pre&s;ent, mortally &s;tabb'd to the heart; the fatal weapon, bathed in his blood, was in your hand; a knife of a dangerous and unlawful con&s;truction, which you admit to be your property, and bearing your chri&s;tian name upon the handle, though of any other name that belongs to you, you contumaciou&s;ly refu&s;e to make di&s;covery, a circum&s;tance, let me ob&s;erve to you, of a very &s;u&s;picious a&s;pect. The pockets of the decea&s;ed had been rifled, and his pur&s;e, containing money to no &s;mall amount, was found, not indeed in your hands, but within your reach and under your eye; certain
<PB N="168" REF="174">
it is, it had been ravi&s;h'd from him by violence, and the pre&s;umption is, that it was your purpo&s;e to rob as well as murder, but that being &s;urpriz'd unawares, you had not yet actually po&s;&s;e&s;s'd your&s;elf of the &s;poils which had tempted you to that horrid act. It has been objected to me by one now pre&s;ent, that I was too lenient in relea&s;ing you &s;o ea&s;ily from the temporary confinement I inflicted upon you, when you broke the peace by an unprovok'd and violent a&s;&s;ault upon the unhappy party, now no more: to this I reply, that I rather wi&s;h I had ab|&s;tain'd from puni&s;hing at all in the fir&s;t in|&s;tance, apprehending, as I do, that your vin|dictive and cruel rage again&s;t the afore&s;aid party was probably inflam'd and aggravated to the height of murder by that very puni&s;hment you had on his account incurr'd, &s;light as it was. You have, or affect to have, receiv'd an injury by a &s;train; if &s;o, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve that it is but one among&s;t a cloud of circum&s;tances, that bear again&s;t you; for what &s;o natural as that a &s;trong and vigorous youth, like Thomas Weevil, &s;hould make a &s;truggle for his life, and that you in the a&s;&s;ault &s;hould not e&s;cape un|hurt, though fatally too &s;ucce&s;sful in the per|petration
<PB N="169" REF="175">
of your inhuman purpo&s;es? The youth, who fell under your deadly &s;troke, liv'd among&s;t us, his neighbours, in good repute, an hone&s;t, unoffending, peaceable lad, the &s;on of an indu&s;trious father, who&s;e tears are now watering his breathle&s;s corp&s;e, and who&s;e cries are &s;ent up to the throne of ju&s;tice again&s;t you his murderer."</Q></P>
<P>Whil&s;t the Ju&s;tice was uttering the&s;e words, the countenance of Henry turned deadly pale, and giving a &s;igh, he ca&s;t up his eyes and fell backwards in a &s;woon. Though he was &s;ur|rounded by the men who had apprehended him, there was not one who moved a hand to &s;ave him, &s;o that he came with his whole weight upon the floor, where he laid, &s;tretcht at his length, in&s;en&s;ible, and to appearance dead. The Ju&s;tice &s;tarted from his &s;eat, and exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Behold, conviction upon the face of it! My words have reach'd his heart! con&s;cience has &s;mitten him at la&s;t, obdurate as he was!"</Q></P>
<P>The triumph of eloquence was painted in his countenance, and he looked around him, as if to demand the tribute of applau&s;e from all who had heard him.</P>

<P>THE guiltle&s;s pri&s;oner, who had fainted with the agony of his &s;prain, encrea&s;ed by &s;tanding &s;o long in pre&s;ence of the Ju&s;tice, &s;oon recovered, and with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the by-&s;tanders was rai&s;ed from the floor; he was now indulged with a &s;eat, being unable to keep his legs, and in this po&s;ture reque&s;ted leave to &s;ay a few words for him&s;elf before he was di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed to pri&s;on.</P>
<P>He began by accounting for his &s;woon from the natural cau&s;e, a&s;&s;erting that it was in his &s;truggle with the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, whom he knew only by the name of Bow&s;ey, that he got his hurt; that it was then he wrenched from him the bloody knife found in his hand, which he ac|knowledged to be his own, explaining how it came to be in Bow&s;ey's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, when he emptied his pockets before he &s;et to with Wee|vil on the green: to this fact he feared he had no witne&s;s, as no one el&s;e would a&s;&s;i&s;t or come near him on that occa&s;ion. <Q REND="inline">"Hard indeed is my ca&s;e,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"in this particular, who

<P>Here Blachford appealed to the by-&s;tanders, if there was any one pre&s;ent who could bear witne&s;s to the pri&s;oner's delivery of the knife to Bow&s;ey. The an&s;wer was loud and gene|ral in the negative. <Q REND="inline">"Then let us have no more arguing on that point,"</Q> added he, <Q REND="inline">"we &s;hall not take the fact on your &s;ingle a&s;&s;ertion."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I have done,"</Q> replied the pri&s;oner; <Q REND="inline">"God knows I &s;peak the truth."</Q></P>
<P>There was a per&s;on among&s;t the crowd, who had been a &s;ilent ob&s;erver of all that pa&s;&s;ed, and now &s;tept forward with much gra|vity, crying out in an authoritative tone, <Q REND="inline">"I conjure you, Wor&s;hipful Sir, for the love of God, and by your duty as a magi&s;trate, &s;itting here to admini&s;ter impartial ju&s;tice to the ac|cu&s;ed no le&s;s than to the accu&s;ers, that you &s;uffer the pri&s;oner to proceed in his defence, nay, verily, that you encourage and provoke him thereunto."</Q></P>
<P>This per&s;on, by name Ezekiel Daw, was one of tho&s;e itinerant apo&s;tles called Me|thodi&s;ts, who preach <HI>&s;ub dio</HI> to the country

folks out of trees, and being a man &s;trong in zeal and loud of lungs, was followed with great avidity: his appeal was not unattended to, and the pri&s;oner was ordered to proceed in his defence.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t ever lament,"</Q> re&s;umed Henry, <Q REND="inline">"my neglect in forgetting to demand of Bow|&s;ey the fatal in&s;trument I had entru&s;ted to his keeping; but when the&s;e facts &s;hall be inve&s;ti|gated at a &s;uperior tribunal, and I am brought to the bar to plead for my life, I &s;hall call upon the&s;e men who now depo&s;e again&s;t me, to declare upon their oaths, whether they di&s;cover'd any other weapon in my hand, &s;ave only the knife I had recover'd from the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in."</Q></P>
<P>The Ju&s;tice here put the que&s;tion to the parties, who jointly an&s;wered, that they did not ob&s;erve any other weapon which the pri|&s;oner had. <Q REND="inline">"And what need is there of any other,"</Q> replied the Ju&s;tice, <Q REND="inline">"&s;eeing that the mortal &s;tab was given with this very knife."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Let the body be in&s;pected,"</Q> &s;aid the pri|&s;oner, <Q REND="inline">"and you &s;hall find a violent contu&s;ion on the head by the blow of a bludgeon; this was the fir&s;t &s;troke which the unhappy man receiv'd, and this, it is to be pre&s;um'd, brought

<P>AS &s;oon as the pri&s;oner had concluded his defence, the Ju&s;tice and his clerk re|tired into another room to con&s;ult together upon his commitment. The impre&s;&s;ion which the foregoing defence made upon the hearers was not in all ca&s;es unfavourable to the plead|er; &s;ome were inclined to believe him inno|cent, many were &s;taggered by his relation, and not a few of the &s;ofter &s;ex were melted into tears by his language and addre&s;s, though they knew not how to decide upon his argu|ment.</P>
<P>Ezekiel Daw betrayed great agitation, deep|ly groaning in the &s;pirit, yet refrained from words. In the interim, a poor widow, the mother of Su&s;an May, who picked up a &s;canty livelihood by compounding a few &s;imple me|dicines for the poor villagers, had &s;tept home, and now returned with &s;ome &s;tuff in a bottle, which &s;he gave to Henry for his &s;prain, &s;ay|ing, as &s;he pre&s;ented it to him, <Q REND="inline">"God knows the truth; thou may'&s;t or thou may'&s;t not be
<PB N="177" REF="183">
guilty, yet I give it thee in charity, for truly thy hurt is great, and thou art in grievous tor|ture."</Q></P>
<P>This unexpected in&s;tance, that there was one humane brea&s;t to be found, which harboured pity for his haple&s;s condition, &s;truck him with &s;uch tender yet joyful &s;urprize, that with a heart too full for utterance, and eyes over|flowing with tears, he took the gift in &s;ilence, fixing a look upon the donor, which &s;pake all that tongue-tied gratitude could convey.</P>
<P>The poor widow, whom awe and re&s;pect had kept &s;ilent before the Ju&s;tice, now ad|dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to the per&s;on who had &s;poke &s;o &s;lightingly of her daughter, and demanded if it was not a ba&s;e and cruel thing to bla&s;t the character of a poor girl as he had done, in the hearing of all her neighbours. <Q REND="inline">"As for this &s;tranger lad,"</Q> added &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"I know him not, God only knows what he may be in heart; but though he were all or more than you de&s;cribe him to be, he has done ju&s;tice to my child, and I thank him for it: if he has murder'd a man, to be &s;ure it is a heinous and a horrid crime, but it is no le&s;s a ba&s;e and cowardly action in you to &s;lander an innocent
<PB N="178" REF="184">
poor girl, who has neither father nor brother to &s;tand up for her."</Q></P>
<P>Before the defamer could collect his thoughts for a reply to this appeal, Ezekiel Daw, the preacher, had once more put him&s;elf forward in an attitude to &s;peak, and all eyes being upon him, expectation held the a&s;&s;embly mute, when he delivered him&s;elf as follows:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Verily, brethren, the charity of this poor widow to an afflicted &s;tranger, and the word which &s;he hath utter'd in reproof of &s;lander, have been a comfort unto my heart, and a refre&s;hment, as it were, of my bowels in the Lord: and thou, John Jenkins, who art here|by rebuked for an evil tongue, humble thy|&s;elf, I exhort thee, John Jenkins, before this the mother of the dam&s;el, whom thou ha&s;t made evil report of, and be humbled in thy pride of &s;peech, keeping a better watch in time to come upon the door of thy lips. Slander, my good neighbours, is a wicked thing; be|ware of &s;lander, for it is filthy, it is abomi|nable; it biteth &s;harper than the tooth of the cockatrice; it is more deadly than the tongue of the a&s;p: away with it therefore, away with it from among&s;t you! O John, John, knowe&s;t
<PB N="179" REF="185">
thou not the calling whereunto thou art called in this place of trial, where thou art &s;ummoned in the &s;ight of God to render up the truth in fair and hone&s;t te&s;timony, be it unto the life, or be it unto the death of this thy fellow crea|ture arraigned before the magi&s;trate? What had'&s;t thou to do, John Jenkins, to impeach the te&s;timony of that poor dam&s;el, to whom the pri&s;oner was di&s;po&s;ed to appeal, becau&s;e thou did&s;t &s;urpri&s;e her in the tender moment of parting from this her fellow-&s;ervant, con|cede unto him the ki&s;s of peace? or what if I &s;hould grant it were the ki&s;s of love? Be|hold, the youth is of a comely vi&s;age, and &s;aving this &s;u&s;picion under which he &s;orrow|eth, verily I pronounce him to be of an inge|nuous a&s;pect; &s;o art not thou, John Jenkins, for the countenance of the &s;landerer is not open and erect; he ca&s;teth his eyes down to the ground; he lurketh about in &s;ecret places, &s;eeking whom he may devour, and of a truth he doth devour them, when he getteth them privily into his net. Brethren, I would fain &s;peak more copiou&s;ly to you on the heinou&s;|ne&s;s of &s;lander, but neither the time nor place will admit of it; but, on the Lord's day next, God willing, I purpo&s;e more at large to de|&s;cant
<PB N="180" REF="186">
upon the topic: in the mean time, let the example of this poor widow be unto you a le&s;&s;on of charity and good works; for &s;he &s;crupled not to pour oil upon the wounds of the way-faring man and &s;tranger, not examin|ing whether he had fallen among&s;t thieves, or was him&s;elf the thief, but doing it in the very bowels of mercy and chri&s;tian commi&s;eration, kindly compa&s;&s;ionating his angui&s;h, as one fel|low creature to another not pronouncing upon his guilt, as you &s;eem forward to do, but leaving it to God and his country to acquit him, or condemn.&mdash;And now, I warn thee, John Jenkins, again&s;t a certain thing to which thou art no le&s;s addicted than to back-biting; I mean mockery, and an idle faculty of turn|ing &s;erious things, and even &s;acred, into ridi|cule, gibing and jeering at thy more pious brethren, who are patient of thy taunts; and why? verily, becau&s;e they de&s;pi&s;e thee, and hold thee as a very &s;illy fellow: make not thine idle companions merry at my co&s;t; &s;coff not at me, John Jenkins, nor put thy &s;en&s;ual fancies to my account, as if I had given war|rant to familiarities between young people of different &s;exes: though the ki&s;s of peace, of friend&s;hip, nay of love it&s;elf, may be innocent

<P>Ezekiel Daw had &s;carce concluded this ha|rangue, when the Ju&s;tice and his clerk, having broken up their council, entered the room. The warrant under the hand and &s;eal of Blach|ford was now completed, and the con&s;table di|rected to take his pri&s;oner into &s;afe cu&s;tody, and deliver him into the hands of the keeper of the county gaol. And now his wor&s;hip was about to break up the a&s;&s;embly, when Eze|kiel once more &s;tood forward, and begged leave to &s;ay a few words on the &s;core of hu|manity, touching the condition of the pri&s;oner. <Q REND="inline">"Say on, Ezekiel,"</Q> quoth the Ju&s;tice, <Q REND="inline">"but be not long-winded, for we have already de|voted much time and pains to the examination of this bu&s;ine&s;s."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"May it plea&s;e your Wor&s;hip,"</Q> &s;aid Eze|kiel, <Q REND="inline">"to be reminded that the day is now far &s;pent, and the county gaol lieth at a con&s;ider|able di&s;tance, wherefore I do humbly con|ceive,

&s;eeing the unhappy youth, whom you have thought fit to commit thereunto, is forely maimed and aggrieved, that you will not find it needful to &s;end him forth upon his way this evening; furthermore, I do with all &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion take leave to &s;ugge&s;t unto your Wor&s;hip, that this his wounded and painful condition may move your humanity to recom|mend unto the keeper of the gaol, not to load his limbs with fetters, one of which is already, by the vi&s;itation of Providence, &s;ufficiently di&s;|abled to an&s;wer all the purpo&s;es of confine|ment, and &s;ecure him from e&s;cape, which I under&s;tand to be the only &s;alvo that the law of the land acknowledges as any ju&s;tification for that barbarous and el&s;e unwarrantable practice. Now, if it plea&s;e your Wor&s;hip to empower your poor &s;ervant in Chri&s;t to &s;ig|nify this your de&s;ire unto the gaoler (who, permit me to ob&s;erve to you, is but of a mer|cile&s;s fraternity) I do purpo&s;e, God permitting me, to accompany this poor creature unto the pri&s;on, yea, even into the dungeon thereof, unle&s;s I am otherwi&s;e let and with&s;tood in &s;uch my purpo&s;ed vi&s;itation; which being permit|ted, I will then and there impart unto him &s;uch your wor&s;hip's charitable admonition,
<PB N="183" REF="189">
and al&s;o do my utmo&s;t to move his bowels of mercy till he &s;hall thereunto accord."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Ezekiel,"</Q> cried the Ju&s;tice, <Q REND="inline">"I have heard you with great patience; but I &s;hall not think fit to make more wa&s;te of my time in li&s;tening to a methodi&s;t's &s;ermon, which has nothing to do with the bu&s;ine&s;s in que&s;tion, now di&s;mi&s;&s;ed and done with: the fellow mu&s;t go to gaol, and it mu&s;t be left to the di&s;cre|tion of the gaoler how to deal with him when he is there."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am unlearned, Wor&s;hipful Sir,"</Q> replied Ezekiel, <Q REND="inline">"and ea&s;ily per&s;uaded of my own deficiencies, yet I had hope you would have been di&s;pos'd to pardon my poor manner of &s;peaking, &s;eeing that I &s;poke humbly as I ought, and in chri&s;tian charity for a fellow creature, whom, if guilty, we have no right to torture, if innocent, every call to protect and &s;pare; but if the&s;e words are offen&s;ive to your Wor&s;hip's ears, and the motives &s;uch as your Wor&s;hip does not approve, I will be no longer tedious unto you: I &s;tand corrected, and am &s;ilent."</Q></P>
<P>At this moment Henry ca&s;t a look upon his humble advocate, which guilt never coun|terfeited, and &s;en&s;ibility could not exceed; it
<PB N="184" REF="190">
was as much as heart could &s;ay to heart; the words which accompanied it were few and &s;imple.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"God reward you for your good|ne&s;s!"</Q>&mdash;was all that he could utter; and let my reader a&s;k his heart if there was need of more.</P>
<P>The Ju&s;tice now retired, the con&s;table and his a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors laid their hands upon the pri&s;oner, and a cord being provided for &s;ecuring his arms, they were proceeding in a very rough manner to apply it, when Ezekiel, who kept a watchful eye upon their proceedings, cried out in a loud tone of voice&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I take God to witne&s;s again&s;t you, if you treat him with any wanton cruelty: he is your pri&s;oner, it is true, but the law holds no man guilty till conviction. The truth will come to light! the truth will come to light!"</Q></P>
<P>In the very in&s;tant, whil&s;t the&s;e prophetic words were on his lips, behold Alexander Kinloch ha&s;tily entered the room, and calling out to the people, who were handcuffing the pri&s;oner, bade them to de&s;i&s;t from meddling with that guiltle&s;s per&s;on.</P>
<P>A&s;toni&s;hment &s;eized the whole company. Ezekiel Daw could not contain his joy.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Beautiful are the feet of tho&s;e who bring
<PB N="185" REF="191">
glad tidings of peace,"</Q> he exclaimed in a tran&s;port.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"What talk you of the feet!"</Q> cried Alexander, <Q REND="inline">"beautiful indeed is the hand of the &s;urgeon, beautiful is his art; aye, and you may think your&s;elves happy that I am here living among&s;t you to dre&s;s your wounds, and heal your hurts, and &s;natch you as it were out of the very jaws of death, as I have done by Thomas Weevil. A beautiful figure any one of you wou'd make with a deep ga&s;h in the &s;kull, and another in the ribs, if there was nobody but Mother May to dre&s;s your &s;ores; fore gad, &s;he wou'd cook a dinner for the worms before the par&s;on cou'd &s;ay grace to it; but <HI>ars medendi artium ars e&s;t:</HI> now there is none of you knows what that means, and yet they are Hippocrates's own words, and he that finds them out, finds out more than any here will have the wit to di&s;|cover. A pretty &s;et of heads truly are your's, my wi&s;e neighbours, to let the villain go loo&s;e, and tie up the innocent man. Why, Bow&s;ey is the rogue that did the job for Tom Weevil; this poor lad was his re&s;cuer and de|fender; aye, and wou'd have &s;av'd him from all manner of hurt or harm, if he wou'd have li&s;ten'd to his warning; but then, indeed, I &s;hould not
<PB N="186" REF="192">
have had the credit of bringing him to life again, nor he the plea&s;ure of being cur'd by my hands. And now, ma&s;ter con&s;table, you will do well to betake your&s;elf to his wor&s;hip, and move him to revoke his mittimus, for here comes old Thomas Weevil him&s;elf, and he will verify every word that I have been telling you."</Q></P>
<P>The miller now made his appearance, and entering the ju&s;tice's private chamber with Kin|loch, there gave &s;uch an account of the affair, from the authority of his &s;on, who&s;e head, though roughly treated, had not been deprived of recollection, as made it nece&s;&s;ary for Blach|ford to give orders for &s;etting Henry at large.</P>
<P>Great was the joy and exultation of Eze|kiel Daw upon this occa&s;ion, and not the le&s;s for the credit he took to him&s;elf in having given proof of his &s;uperior &s;agacity in di&s;co|vering the innocence of the &s;u&s;pected per|&s;on, in &s;pite of all the circum&s;tances urged again&s;t him. It is, however, to be lamented, that the &s;tir and bu&s;tle of the crowd was now too great to admit of Ezekiel's being heard, who had &s;o fair an occa&s;ion of di&s;playing his eloquence; but though he frequently called
<PB N="187" REF="193">
for attention, crying out,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Hear me, neigh|bours, hear me I be&s;eech you; I am a man of few words,"</Q> yet all was in vain, they neither gave ear to his words, nor is it quite &s;o certain that they would have been only a few, had they given ear to them; &s;o the mat|ter dropt, and his eloquence was &s;trangled in the birth.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XI. When the Heart is right, the Man will be re|&s;pectable, though his Humours are ridiculous.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN old Weevil returned from Blach|ford's chamber with the order of re|lea&s;e, he came up to Henry, and taking him cordially by the hand, declared before all pre|&s;ent, that it was to his courage and humanity he ow'd the pre&s;ervation of his &s;on's life; he lamented the hurt he had got in his defence, offered him his hou&s;e, pur&s;e, and every a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance in his power; confe&s;&s;ed that the whole blame of the fray on the green re&s;ted with his &s;on, and added with an oath, that he had been cruelly dealt by, both then and in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, and that he had told Ju&s;tice
<PB N="188" REF="194">
Blachford as much to his face,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"For why?"</Q> cried he; <Q REND="inline">"'tis a &s;in and a &s;hame, to give evil for good to this poor lad, who in the &s;hort time he has been a &s;tranger among&s;t us, has &s;av'd his ma&s;ter from drowning, and my boy from being murder'd; and what has he got for it?&mdash;why truly, he has been &s;tock'd, maim'd, and impri&s;on'd.&mdash;Shame upon &s;uch treatment! &s;ay I; nay, I'm not afraid to &s;ay, and I care not who hears me; &s;hame upon &s;uch ju&s;tices! and now they tell me,"</Q> added he, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Henry, <Q REND="inline">"your ma&s;ter has turn'd you away: if &s;o, my lad, come to the mill, and &s;o long as there's a wheel that turns, you &s;hall never want a day's work, and a day's pay."</Q></P>
<P>Henry thank'd him for all his offers, but de&s;ired to &s;et him right about his ma&s;ter, from whom he had received the kinde&s;t treat|ment; and as for leaving his &s;ervice, that, he a&s;&s;ured the miller, was entirely his own act and deed, for which he had certain rea&s;ons, that by no means applied to the per&s;on of Doctor Cawdle.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"No, no,"</Q> &s;aid Kinloch, <Q REND="inline">"we know well enough which way tho&s;e rea&s;ons look, and that per&s;on, I can tell you, is in a terrible taking at your leaving us: as
<PB N="189" REF="195">
for the Doctor, he will give you a hearty wel|come; and for my part, my good lad, I have &s;uch a &s;oft &s;ide towards you, that if you will buckle to the bu&s;ine&s;s, and ob&s;erve what I &s;hall teach you, I will make a man of you, and perhaps enable you in time to perform as great a cure as I hope to perfect on the body of neighbour Weevil's &s;on, who, by the Doctor's indi&s;po&s;ition, is happily fallen under my hands."</Q></P>
<P>The crowd now di&s;per&s;ed, and evening be|ing advanced, Henry's ankle withal in no condition for journeying, he was con&s;trained to forego his engagement to Su&s;an, and ac|cepted the friendly invitation of Ezekiel Daw, to pa&s;s the night at the cottage of Mother May, where that good creature took up his abode.</P>
<P>When Ezekiel had refre&s;hed his gue&s;t with &s;uch humble viands as his &s;tore contained, and Goody May had again fomented his ankle, Henry, having now appea&s;ed two impor|tunate &s;olicitors, pain and hunger, began to make tho&s;e grateful acknowledgments which his heart &s;ugge&s;ted, till he was &s;topped &s;hort by both parties at once, who &s;ilenced him by prote&s;ting they would not be thanked for do|ing
<PB N="190" REF="196">
nothing more than common humanity re|quired of them to do.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"As for me,</Q> &s;aid Ezekiel, <Q REND="inline">"I declare unto you in verity, that this hath been unto me an occa&s;ion of triumph and ovation, and if thou, Henry, had'&s;t turned out other than a true man and an hone&s;t, I would hardly have been per&s;uaded to put faith in the index of the human heart any more; but thou ha&s;t verified the hand-writing of nature in thy features, and my bowels did not yearn towards thee without rea&s;on. Truly, young man, my heart rejoiceth in thy de|liverance, and great is my joy that thou art found innocent in the &s;ight of thine enemies; therefore will I &s;ing and give prai&s;e with the be&s;t member that I have; and thou, Goody May, although thy pipe is but feeble, &s;halt bear thy part in the melody."</Q></P>
<P>This &s;aid, the good man uttered a dolorous hum, by way of pitch-note, which was echoed by dame May in a &s;hrill octave, and then, delivering out the fir&s;t line of John Hopkins's 108th p&s;alm, he &s;et up his note with &s;o loud and na&s;al a twang, as made Henry almo&s;t jump from his &s;eat, and with more fervency than melody, chanted forth the afore&s;aid p&s;alm, accompanied after a fa&s;hion
<PB N="191" REF="197">
by the dame, till having travelled together through <HI>Sichem</HI> and the <HI>vale of Succoth,</HI> they found them&s;elves deeply engaged in the fol|lowing &s;tanza, viz.
<Q><L>Moab my wa&s;h-pot is, my &s;hoe</L>
<L>O'er Edom I will throw,</L>
<L>Upon the land of Pale&s;tine</L>
<L>In triumph I will go.&mdash;</L></Q>
When behold, Alexander Kinloch, without any ceremony, bolted into the room, ju&s;t in time to hear Ezekiel roar forth his intended tri|umphs over the land of Pale&s;tine, upon which, in a har&s;h north-briti&s;h key, &s;o totally at di&s;|cord with the p&s;almody as to bring it to a &s;udden &s;top, he in&s;tantly cried out,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"What the plague po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es you now, brother doctor, to be triumphing over Pale&s;tine at &s;uch a rate? if you &s;et up your howl there, let me tell you, the Turks will &s;oon &s;top your pipes with a tight cord round your gullet, and a &s;hort dance at the end of your &s;ong. Why, man, I know the ground every inch of it: when I was &s;urgeon's mate of the old Dread|nought, I was in the thick of the infidels at Scanderoon, and Saint John D'Acre, and Alexandria, and where not. Zooks and blood!
<PB N="192" REF="198">
if you was as bold as Pre&s;ter John, being a Frank as you are, they would &s;et you on the back of a &s;curvy a&s;s, and buffet you through the &s;treets for their &s;port.

<P>Ezekiel Daw, in his early years, had been trained to the art of handling the pe&s;tle, and pounding drugs in the rural laboratory of a petty retailer of medical wares; he had there acquired as much knowledge in pharmacy and &s;urgery, as &s;erved him to &s;et up Goody May in the humble art of curing broken &s;hins and bloody no&s;es, by which &s;he picked up a pittance among&s;t her poor neighbours, and &s;ometimes entrenched &s;o far upon Doctor Cawdle's practice, as to admini&s;ter a do&s;e of buckthorn or jalap, for &s;couring the bowels of the pea&s;antry, after a drunken bout or &s;ur|feit at a Chri&s;tmas fea&s;t. This was not alto|gether overlooked by Kinloch, though he
<PB N="193" REF="199">
held her art in too much contempt to make public his complaint of it; &s;till he took all occa&s;ions that fell in his way of giving her a dab of his ridicule, as we have already in|&s;tanced, and this was not confined to her only, but extended to her friend and teacher, Eze|kiel, whom in his gayer moments (and this now pre&s;ent was pre-eminently of that &s;ort) he dignified, in the way of irony, with the title of Brother Doctor; and indeed that wor|thy per&s;on was very generally &s;tiled by his poorer neighbours, particularly tho&s;e of his his own flock, not ludicrou&s;ly, but reveren|tially, Doctor Daw.</P>
<P>He was a thin &s;pare man, of a pale and fallow complexion, about the age of fifty, up|right in his per&s;on, and &s;tiff as a hedge-&s;take, with yellow perpendicular hair; he was by nature ira&s;cible, and of a bilious habit, but, by long temperance and religious &s;elf-correc|tion, had humbled and &s;ubdued his &s;pirit &s;o as to be patient under in&s;ults; in &s;hort, he was a creature compounded of mo&s;t benevolent and excellent qualities, with a &s;trong tincture of enthu&s;ia&s;m over all; in the mean while it mu&s;t be owned that Ezekiel had no objection to a little amicable controver&s;y; and there is rea|&s;on
<PB N="194" REF="200">
to believe, that if he had any leaning to one &s;ide more than the other in the handling of a que&s;tion, it was to that &s;ide where his own opinion took po&s;t.</P>
<P>It was therefore no &s;mall proof of his con|troul over him&s;elf, that though he was thus cut &s;hort in his pious melody by the North Briton, yet he was content to pa&s;s it off with a &s;imple remark to his vi&s;itor, that he was under a mi&s;take in &s;uppo&s;ing he had any de|&s;ign of undertaking a voyage to the Holy Land, (properly &s;o called) his humble endea|vours a&s;piring no higher than to keep him&s;elf holy in the land where he lived; with this in|tent he had been giving God thanks in an hymn for the deliverance of the guiltle&s;s youth there pre&s;ent; <Q REND="inline">"and I tru&s;t,"</Q> added he, <Q REND="inline">"thou did&s;t not jeer at the matter of the hymn it&s;elf, but &s;imply at the unworthine&s;s of the performer."</Q> Then, turning to Kinloch, with a complacent &s;mile, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"And thou too, brother Alex|ander, art entitled to a ble&s;&s;ing, not only as being the bearer of glad tidings, but the in|&s;trument, as I hope, under Providence, of &s;aving the life of our wounded neighbour."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, truly,"</Q> cried Kinloch, with a &s;igni|ficant nod, <Q REND="inline">"the man may thank Providence

<P>The&s;e words put an end to the controver&s;y; and hone&s;t Ezekiel, lifting a &s;tone pitcher by the ear, which he had placed upon the ta|ble, filled out a can of ale to each of his gue&s;ts, and after for him&s;elf; then &s;haking Alexander by the hand, with a &s;mile of perfect reconciliation and benignity, cried, <Q REND="inline">"Come, brother Doctor, here's a cup of thanks to you, and a &s;peedy recovery to your patient."</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER I. A Di&s;&s;ertation, which our Readers will either &s;leep over, or pa&s;s over, as be&s;t &s;uits them.</HEAD>
<P>AN author will naturally ca&s;t his compo|&s;ition in that kind of &s;tyle and character, where he thinks him&s;elf mo&s;t likely to &s;ucceed; and in this he will be directed by con&s;idering, in the fir&s;t place, what is the natural turn of his own mind, where his &s;trength lies, and to what his talents point; and &s;econdly, by the public ta&s;te, which, however much it is his in|tere&s;t to con&s;ult, &s;hould not be &s;uffered to be|tray him into undertakings he is not fitted for.</P>
<P>Novels, like dramas, may certainly be com|po&s;ed either in the tragic or comic ca&s;t, ac|cording to the writer's choice and fancy. Tales of fiction, with mournful cata&s;trophes, have been wrought up with very con&s;iderable effect; I could name &s;ome of the pathetic &s;ort, which are uncommonly beautiful and
<PB N="202" REF="208">
deeply intere&s;ting; their &s;ucce&s;s might well en|courage any author, who has powers and pro|pen&s;ities &s;uitable, to copy the attempt; on the other hand, examples mu&s;ter &s;tronge&s;t for the &s;tory with a happy ending: middle mea&s;ures have al&s;o been &s;truck upon by &s;ome, and novels of the tragi-comic character aptly and ingeniou&s;ly devi&s;ed, which, after agitating the pa&s;&s;ions of terror and pity, allay them with the unexpected relief of happine&s;s and good for|tune in the concluding &s;cenes.</P>
<P>By all or any of the&s;e channels, the author may &s;hape his cour&s;e to fame, if he has &s;kill to &s;hun the &s;hoals of in&s;ipidity on the one hand, and the rocks of improbability on the other; in one word, if he will keep the happy mean of nature. Exqui&s;itely fine are tho&s;e &s;en&s;ations, which the well-wrought tale of pity excites; but double care is required to guide them to the right point, becau&s;e they are &s;o penetrating: whoever &s;tirs tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions in a guilty cau&s;e may do infinite mi&s;chief, for they &s;ink into young and tender hearts, and where they &s;ink, they leave a deep and permanent im|pre&s;&s;ion; they are curious in&s;truments in the hand of the arti&s;t, but murderous weapons in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="209">Cheerful fictions, with happy endings, are written with more ea&s;e, and have le&s;s ri&s;k as to the moral; they play about the fancy in a more harmle&s;s manner; the author is &s;eldom &s;o carele&s;s of his characters as not to deal out what is termed poetical ju&s;tice among&s;t them, rewarding the good and puni&s;hing the un|worthy; pride and oppre&s;&s;ion are rarely made to triumph ultimately; engaging libertini&s;m &s;eldom fails to reform; and true love; after all its trials, is finally crowned with po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The mixt or compo&s;ite &s;ort, which &s;teer between grave and gay, yet are tinctured with each, deal out terror and &s;u&s;pen&s;e in their pro|gre&s;s; artfully interwoven into the &s;ub&s;tance of the fable, for the purpo&s;e of introducing &s;ome new and unfore&s;een rever&s;e of fortune at the &s;tory's clo&s;e, which is to put the tortured mind at re&s;t. This demands a conduct of &s;ome &s;kill; for if the writer's zeal for the intro|duction of new and &s;triking incidents, wherein con&s;i&s;ts the merit of this &s;pecies of compo&s;i|tion, be not tempered by a due attention to nature, character and probability, the whole web is broken, and the work falls to the ground: in good hands it becomes a very plea&s;ing production, for the curio&s;ity is kept
<PB N="204" REF="210">
alive through the whole progre&s;s of the nar|rative, and the mind that has been &s;u&s;pended between hope and fear, at la&s;t &s;ub&s;ides in perfect &s;atisfaction with the ju&s;t and equitable event of things.</P>
<P>A novel may be carried on in a &s;eries of letters or in regular detail; both methods have their parti&s;ans, and in numbers they &s;eem pretty equally divided; which of the two is the more popular, I cannot take upon my&s;elf to &s;ay; but I &s;hould gue&s;s that letters give the writer mo&s;t amu&s;ement and relief, not only from their greater diver&s;ity of &s;tyle, but from the re&s;pite which their intermi&s;&s;ions afford him. The&s;e advantages however have a counterpoi&s;e, for his cour&s;e becomes more circuitous and &s;ubject to embarra&s;&s;ment, than when he takes the nar|rative wholly into his own hands; without great management and addre&s;s in keeping his dates progre&s;&s;ive, and di&s;tinctly methodized, his reader is expo&s;ed to be called back and puzzled; and as the characters who conduct the corre&s;pondence mu&s;t be kept a&s;under, the &s;cene is oftentimes di&s;tracted, where we wi&s;h it to be entire, or el&s;e the intercour&s;e of letters is made glaringly unnatural and pedantic by compre&s;&s;ing the di&s;tances from which they are
<PB N="205" REF="211">
dated, and putting two people to the ridicu|lous nece&s;&s;ity of writing long narratives to each other, when conver&s;ation was within their reach.</P>
<P>For my&s;elf, having now made experiment of both methods, I can only &s;ay, that were I to con&s;ult my own amu&s;ement &s;olely, I &s;hould prefer the vehicle of letters: this however mu&s;t be acknowledged, that all conver&s;ations, where the &s;peakers are brought upon the &s;cene, are far more natural when delivered at fir&s;t hand, than when retailed by a corre&s;pon|dent; for we know that &s;uch &s;ort of narratives do not commonly pa&s;s by the po&s;t, and the letter, both in &s;tyle and &s;ub&s;tance, appears ex|tremely &s;tiff, tedious, and pedantic. Upon the whole, I &s;hould conjecture that the writer is be&s;t accommodated by the one, and the reader mo&s;t gratified by the other: I hope I am right in my conjecture as to the reader's preference of the method I am now pur&s;uing, el&s;e I have cho&s;en ill for my&s;elf, and gained no credit by the &s;acrifice.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II. A Morning Vi&s;it, which produces a &s;u&s;picious Situation.</HEAD>
<P>WITH the fir&s;t dawn of the morning, the di&s;con&s;olate Su&s;an May &s;et out in &s;earch of her beloved Henry, whom &s;he had eagerly expected the evening before, and who&s;e breach of promi&s;e &s;he was at a lo&s;s to account for. A thou&s;and anxious thoughts occupied her mind, and the &s;u&s;picion that he had now totally renounced her was not the lea&s;t of her alarms. She went directly to her mother's cottage, and, having met no one by the way, was ignorant of the events which had cau&s;ed her di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>Ezekiel Daw was an early ri&s;er, and had already &s;allied out; but Henry, to whom Goody May had ho&s;pitably re&s;igned her bed, was &s;till buried in profound repo&s;e, and &s;leep|ing off the fatigues of the preceding day. The cottage door being open, and no &s;urly porter to guard it, the dam&s;el, without let or hindrance, made &s;trait way to the little cham|ber
<PB N="207" REF="213">
where her mother &s;lept, and entering it without noi&s;e, to her great &s;urpri&s;e di&s;covered not the good old dame within the &s;heets, but the youthful object of her pa&s;&s;ion, fa&s;t in the arms of Morpheus, and glowing with the ro&s;y tints of health and beauty. It was a &s;cene for eyes le&s;s intere&s;ted than tho&s;e of Su&s;an to con|template with admiration; &s;he gazed upon him with rapture and delight. A con&s;ider|able time &s;he &s;tood fixt and motionle&s;s, ba|lancing in her mind betwixt the propriety of retiring out of the chamber and the plea&s;ure of remaining in it. The longer &s;he indulged her &s;en&s;es in the contemplation of his per&s;on, the le&s;s inclined &s;he was to &s;acrifice the enjoy|ment of them: love and de&s;ire &s;ugge&s;ted to her a variety of expedients, which timidity and di&s;cretion would not yet permit her to accord to. Curio&s;ity was urgent with her to be re&s;olved how it came to pa&s;s that Henry &s;hould be &s;leeping in her mother's bed. This &s;ame curio&s;ity prompted her to wake him, and love was forward to in&s;truct her in the mode; a gentle pre&s;&s;ure of his hand effected the wi&s;hed-for purpo&s;e. He &s;tarted, waked, and ha&s;tily cried out&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Ah, Su&s;an, is it you? How came you hither?"</Q>&mdash;This was enough
<PB N="208" REF="214">
to introduce an explanation, which in few words told all that either party was intere&s;ted to be informed of. Events &s;o full of terror to the feelings of a heart &s;en&s;itive as Su&s;an's, though related &s;imply and without exaggera|tion by the object of her affection, had &s;o agi|tated her, that either feigning or really feeling inability to keep her feet, &s;he had &s;uddenly &s;unk down upon the &s;ide of the bed, and by an action &s;eemingly involuntary, cla&s;ped one of his hands in both her's, whil&s;t lamenting over his &s;ufferings with &s;ighs and tears of &s;ympathy and condolence.</P>
<P>When the tale was at an end, and his deli|verance announced, the fond girl rai&s;ed her eyes to heaven in &s;ilent thankfulne&s;s, and then glancing them upon the youth with an ex|pre&s;&s;ion that left nothing in her heart untold, dropt lifele&s;s as it were upon his neck, and laid without motion in his arms.</P>
<P>In this moment truth compels me to ac|knowledge that the forbearance even of Henry was &s;ore be&s;et and &s;taggered under the attack. Nature (&s;hame upon her!) played a treach|erous part to undermine his re&s;olution; &s;he hurried through his veins like a &s;pell, rai&s;ed a tumult in his heart, and made every nerve in
<PB N="209" REF="215">
his frame tremble with her touch. Rea&s;on, indeed, the governor of the citadel, and con|&s;cience, the centinel of the &s;oul within it, were upon their po&s;t, but uncollected and &s;urpri&s;ed, and &s;carce half-armed for a defence, when, in the moment of danger, their guardian &s;pirit &s;ent a re&s;cue in the per&s;on of the rural apo&s;tle, Ezekiel Daw him&s;elf, who no &s;ooner darted his vi&s;itatorial eye upon the bodies of the two per&s;ons pro&s;trate on the bed, and folded in each other's arms, than having di&s;covered that one of the &s;aid bodies belonged to the male and the other to the female &s;ex, he &s;hrieked out in a key of horror and &s;urpri&s;e&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Child|ren of the &s;erpent! impure ve&s;&s;els of perdition! what in the name of Beelzebub are you about?

<P><PB N="211" REF="217"><Q REND="inline">"Pardon me, &s;ir,"</Q> cried Su&s;an, <Q REND="inline">"I am not fallen in the manner you &s;uppo&s;e; I was &s;orrow-&s;truck with the account of what Henry has &s;uffer'd &s;ince I &s;aw him, and my affliction overpower'd me. I believe I fell into a kind of fit, and &s;o he caught me in his arms. I hope it is neither &s;in nor &s;hame to &s;ympathize with the unfortunate and innocent. If to love him be a crime, I am guilty indeed."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"What telle&s;t thou me of love?"</Q> re&s;umed the preacher; <Q REND="inline">"thou art too young and un|learn'd to know what love means: thou &s;hou'd'&s;t be taught that by them who are older and wi&s;er than thy&s;elf; I have &s;tudied it, child, and revolv'd it in my mind, and I do pronounce upon experience and reflection, that the true and only love is the fulfilling of the law; therefore, tell me not that thou love&s;t this youth, for thou ha&s;t no &s;uch thing about thee; I do aver that thou ha&s;t a war in thy members, and where war is, how can love exi&s;t?"</Q></P>
<P>Henry now interpo&s;ed, and in an humble tone gently reque&s;ted Ezekiel not to chide the dam&s;el, who was not in the offence, having entered his chamber in the pre&s;umption of finding her mother there; and he furthermore

<P><Q REND="inline">"Child,"</Q> replied Ezekiel, <Q REND="inline">"I believe thee; I cannot help believing thee; there is &s;ome|thing in thy countenance that extorts from me my good opinion, and I give perfect credit to thy words from the impre&s;&s;ion I receive by thy looks; but now that the dam&s;el no longer needeth thy &s;upport, prudence warneth thee to de&s;i&s;t from a conference, which may pro|duce

<P>Ezekiel now took his unwilling di&s;ciple by the hand, and led her into the cottage kitchen, where, having &s;eated her on one &s;ide of the chimney, and him&s;elf in a huge wicker chair on the other, he began the following exhorta|tory di&s;cour&s;e:</P>

Thou did&s;t &s;ay, that if to love thy friend Henry were a crime, thou wa&s;t guilty indeed: now to love him as a brother is thy duty; if thou do&s;t that, there is no crime in thy love: &s;earch thine heart therefore, and if thou do&s;t there di&s;cover any

<P><Q REND="inline">"But what method &s;hall I take to bani&s;h them,"</Q> &s;aid Su&s;an?&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"By mortifying the fle&s;h with fa&s;ting,"</Q> replied Ezekiel, <Q REND="inline">"and giving thy&s;elf up to holy exerci&s;es."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Indeed, &s;ir,"</Q> cried the poor girl, <Q REND="inline">"I never neglect my prayers; but then I always pray for Henry; and as to fa&s;ting, if I was to &s;tarve my&s;elf to death, I &s;hou'd never get him out of my thoughts."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Go to,"</Q> exclaimed Ezekiel, <Q REND="inline">"thou art a non&s;en&s;e girl to prate to me in this fa&s;hion. Wilt thou, who art no better than an unfledg'd go&s;ling, barely out of the &s;hell, pretend to argue with me, who have weigh'd, and con&s;ider'd, and perpended all the&s;e mat|ters? aye, let me tell thee, and experienc'd them al&s;o, for I will now relate to thee what occur'd unto my&s;elf: When I was &s;tripling, and work'd as hireling to my ma&s;ter the apo|thecary, his niece, a &s;ightly dam&s;el like thy|&s;elf, came one evening into the &s;hop, whil&s;t I was at the mortar, and being not a little taken
<PB N="215" REF="221">
with my aptitude in handling the pe&s;tle, me|thought &s;he ca&s;t the eyes of affection upon me; &s;he approached near unto me, and with the mo&s;t conde&s;cending familiarity, graciou&s;ly leant her arm upon my &s;houlder; in that in|&s;tant I began to feel the &s;tirrings of the &s;er|pent tempting to unlawful de&s;ires.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'Eze|kiel,'</Q> quoth &s;he, <Q REND="inline">'thou art an indu&s;trious lad; but do&s;t thou not think thou cou'd&s;t find more plea&s;ing amu&s;ement than that of pound|ing the&s;e &s;tinking drugs?'</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'Mi&s;s,'</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline">'the drugs may be un&s;avoury, but hone&s;t in|du&s;try is &s;weet, and tendeth to obtain the grate|ful odour of a good name.'</Q> With that &s;he &s;eis'd the pe&s;tle in her gra&s;p, and wou'd have wrench'd it from my hand.

<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh! yes, &s;ir,"</Q> replied Su&s;an, <Q REND="inline">"I do; but what an&s;wer did the young lady make to you?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Not a word,"</Q> quoth Ezekiel; <Q REND="inline">"not a &s;yllable; but with a to&s;s of her head and a &s;neer, that gave me to under&s;tand &s;he was of|fended at my plainne&s;s, turn'd out of the &s;hop, and never &s;aid a civil thing to me again.

<P>At this in&s;tant Henry entered the room; Su&s;an's eyes gli&s;tened with joy; Ezekiel's ex|po&s;tulation vani&s;hed from her thoughts; even his pe&s;tle and mortar no longer &s;ounded in her ears; &s;he had no &s;en&s;es but for the object in her &s;ight.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="223">Dame May entered the cottage; &s;he ran to her daughter, took her in her arms, and wel|comed her home; &s;he was the darling of her mother: Henry's hone&s;t nature could not al|low him to &s;uppre&s;s any thing that had pa&s;&s;ed between him&s;elf and Su&s;an in her mother's ab|&s;ence. When he had related this to the good dame with all that air of &s;incerity that was natural to him, &s;he, like Ezekiel, immediately a&s;&s;ured him of her entire belief in every thing he had &s;aid, and without qualifying it after Doctor Daw's manner, with any admonitory inferences, &s;he candidly ob&s;erved, that nothing was more natural than for young folks that liked each other, to &s;teal a ki&s;s when it came in their way, and no harm done: <Q REND="inline">"For why?"</Q> added &s;he, turning to Ezekiel, <Q REND="inline">"we mu&s;t not forget that we have been young in our day as well as they."</Q></P>
<P>This was &s;uch point-blank here&s;y again&s;t the doctrines of the good man, ju&s;t now incul|cated, that he &s;tared with amazement upon Dame May; &s;he, who had only nature and not one ray of philo&s;ophy to guide her, was not aware of the reproof &s;he was open to, and before Ezekiel could pump the words up out of his throat, exclaimed&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Lord love
<PB N="218" REF="224">
your &s;weet heart, Mr. Daw, you are &s;urely the be&s;t &s;oul living, but you don't con&s;ider what it is to be young; why love in them is as it were a &s;econd nature, and for us to argue again&s;t it is all one as though we were to preach again&s;t the light of the &s;un."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Hold your tongue, woman,"</Q> cried Eze|kiel; <Q REND="inline">"it is not for an ignoramus like you to talk about preaching. Have I &s;pent my breath for nought? am I become like &s;ound|ing bra&s;s and a tinkling cymbal? are you a preacher, or am I? have you the gift, have you the calling, have you the election? Si|lence, vain woman! and be in &s;ubjection to the higher powers. I have told thy daughter that &s;he is in nowi&s;e to think of love, it becometh not young people &s;o much as to meditate thereupon; and wilt thou now tell her that it is as it were a &s;econd nature? Wilt thou provoke the cravings of thy child, till, like the hor&s;e-leach's daughter, &s;he crieth out, Give, give?"</Q></P>
<P>Dame May perceived that &s;he had nettled the good man without intending it, and there|fore began to &s;often his anger, by a&s;&s;uring him that &s;he never meant to ca&s;t a reflection upon his preaching, to the contrary of which, &s;he
<PB N="219" REF="225">
had always affirmed that there was nobody to compare with him in the neighbourhood, nay, &s;he might &s;ay not in all the county, for a &s;ermon; but &s;he hoped there was no offence in &s;uppo&s;ing he had not turned his thoughts to love-matters.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"There lies your mi&s;take,"</Q> quoth Ezekiel, <Q REND="inline">"for of all the human infirmities it is that which I have &s;tudied with the mo&s;t calm and deliberate attention, having never in any in|&s;tant of my life given way to it my&s;elf, and of con&s;equence am the fitte&s;t per&s;on on that ac|count to give good coun&s;el to others, who are betray'd into that unpardonable weakne&s;s."</Q></P>
<P>Here Henry &s;miled; but what pa&s;&s;ed in his thoughts to provoke that &s;mile, as he did not di&s;cu&s;s, we &s;hall not pre&s;ume to conjecture. Goody May proceeded after her placid manner to prepare for breakfa&s;t: Su&s;an be&s;towed &s;ome &s;tolen glances upon Henry, which did not altogether promi&s;e an implicit obedience to the injunctions of her &s;piritual pa&s;tor, and might fairly rai&s;e a doubt whether &s;he had made even the &s;malle&s;t progre&s;s in a reform, by di&s;mi&s;&s;ing him from her thoughts. Eze|kiel was not the quicke&s;t ob&s;erver of the&s;e tokens, that ever lived, and had moreover at

this moment fixed his attention upon a &s;moak|ing ba&s;on of fre&s;h milk-porridge.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER III. Fortune begins to &s;mile upon our Hero.</HEAD>
<P>ALEXANDER Kinloch having vi&s;ited his patient at the mill, called at the cottage, and made &s;o favourable a report of his own wonderful performances, and the good night's re&s;t that he had procured for the wounded man, that little doubt was now entertained of his &s;peedy recovery. In fact, good fortune, and the critical interpo&s;ition of Henry, had done more for him than all the art of Alex|ander, for the knife had &s;imply glanced upon his ribs, and made a fle&s;h wound, neither deep nor dangerous, and the blood which it drew, though formidable in appearance, was eventu|ally no more than the young miller in his &s;tate of inflammation could well &s;pare, with profit to his habit and con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Kinloch delivered a me&s;&s;age from Doctor Cawdle, de&s;iring Henry to come to him, as he
<PB N="221" REF="227">
was yet confined to his chamber; he al&s;o re|peated his progno&s;tication that Madam Jemima was in a ha&s;ty decline.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Say you &s;o,"</Q> quoth Ezekiel, <Q REND="inline">"why then &s;he is in the propere&s;t place to meet with good advice: her &s;pou&s;e no doubt will exert all his &s;kill in her behalf."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Her &s;pou&s;e indeed!"</Q> cried Kinlcch, <Q REND="inline">"poor creature! what can he do? I had prepar'd a medicine for her, compounded of &s;pecifics &s;overeign in her ca&s;e, which is neither more nor le&s;s than an inordinate u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors acting on an atrabilious habit."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Then what can &s;ave her but the muzzle?"</Q> re&s;umed Daw.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"What can &s;ave her!"</Q> echoed the medical under&s;trapper, <Q REND="inline">"my re|medy cou'd have &s;av'd her; a compound of all antidotes again&s;t hard drinking; a butt to &s;heath the &s;picula of intoxicating potations.

auxiliary to my grand attack, but the&s;e al&s;o &s;he rejected, and now &s;he is con&s;uming away by inte&s;tine fires, for I have done with her."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I am &s;orry for it,"</Q> quoth Henry, <Q REND="inline">"for I fear &s;he is in no fit condition for dy|ing."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Truly I believe not,"</Q> an&s;wered Kin|loch, <Q REND="inline">"yet I pronounce her a dead woman; and I never yet knew any one of my patients, when I have &s;aid that, fail to make my words good.

<P>Here the conver&s;ation was cut &s;hort by the arrival of a po&s;tchai&s;e at the cottage-door, be|longing to the Lady Vi&s;counte&s;s Crowbery. Dame May in&s;tantly di&s;covered the per&s;on of her noble vi&s;itor, and ran out of the hou&s;e to pay her accu&s;tomed devoirs. Kinloch in the meanwhile, with his u&s;ual plea of bu&s;ine&s;s, ha&s;tened away; Su&s;an prevented Henry from the like e&s;cape, by telling him Lady Crowbery called frequently on her mother, but that &s;he did not expect &s;he would come in: Ezekiel
<PB N="223" REF="229">
&s;aid the &s;ame, &s;imply ob&s;erving that it was &s;ome charitable errand, for that worthy lady did a world of good.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Oh! &s;he is the be&s;t lady breathing,"</Q> repeated Su&s;an; <Q REND="inline">"&s;he has a heart for every body that &s;uffers wrongfully, and I will lay my life &s;he has been told of Henry's hard treatment, and is come for &s;ome good purpo&s;e to enquire about him: as &s;ure as can be I have gue&s;s'd it, for &s;he is this moment getting out of her po&s;tchai&s;e, and coming into the hou&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>Henry had his leg upon a &s;tool, but before Lady Crowbery made her appearance, he had rai&s;ed him&s;elf upon his feet, and bowed re|&s;pectfully on her entering: the noble vi&s;itor immediately fixed her eyes upon him; and then turning to Dame May; who followed her, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"This is the young man we have been &s;peaking of: &s;it down, if you plea&s;e; you have &s;trained your ankle, and I will not allow you to &s;tand upon it on my account&mdash;&s;it down, or you will oblige me to go."</Q> She then made a gracious acknowledgement to Su&s;an, and &s;eated her&s;elf oppo&s;ite to Henry. After a &s;hort &s;ilence, &s;he began, apparently with &s;ome de|gree of agitation, to que&s;tion him about the events of the preceding day: he briefly and
<PB N="224" REF="230">
mode&s;tly related them as he was bidden.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I think,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"had I been in Mr. Blach|ford's place, and you had told this &s;tory in your defence, as you have now repeated it to me, I cou'd not have he&s;itated to acquit you; but after all,"</Q> added &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"we &s;hou'd not complain of him for wanting eyes, for ju&s;tice you know ought to be blind."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"But not deaf,"</Q> &s;aid Ezekiel&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Right,"</Q> replied Lady Crowbery; <Q REND="inline">"I am apt to think there is a tone in truth, that no impartial ear can well mi&s;take. But you, Henry (that, I under&s;tand, is your name) ought not only to be acquitted as guiltle&s;s of the crime charged upon you, you &s;hou'd be honour'd and rewarded, for an action that be&s;peaks your heroi&s;m and hu|manity. I hope you have too much gallantry, to refu&s;e a lady's favours. I de&s;ire you will accept this pur&s;e from me; you well de&s;erve it, brave young man, and what is more I &s;u&s;pect you want it, and I have it to &s;pare."</Q></P>
<P>If the grace of giving in any degree con|&s;titutes the value of a gift (which doubtle&s;s it does) this gift came recommended by a manner, that might well apologize for our hero's receiving it with tears of &s;en&s;ibility, and blu&s;hes that be&s;poke a mode&s;t nature over|powered
<PB N="225" REF="231">
by gratitude. He did not &s;peak, but he pre&s;&s;ed his lips upon the pur&s;e, as he took it from her hand; perhaps his aim was at the hand it&s;elf, but re&s;pect &s;topped him &s;hort, and he was awed from the attempt. He turned his eyes upon the countenance of his bene|factre&s;s, and beheld beauty in its wane, be|nevolence in it's meridian. It &s;hould &s;eem that forty years had not yet pa&s;&s;ed over her head, but of tho&s;e it was too plain that a por|tion had been unhappy: her form was &s;till elegant in the extreme; what it had lo&s;t in &s;ub&s;tance, it had gained in delicacy, and the inroads of &s;ickline&s;s and &s;orrow upon the fre&s;h|ne&s;s of her charms were atoned for by &s;o in|tere&s;ting a character of pale and tender &s;en&s;i|bility, that none but a man of gro&s;s ta&s;te would have thought that youth and health were wanting to render the per&s;on of Lady Crow|bery more attractive.</P>

<P>Ezekiel &s;hook his head, and was &s;ilent.

eyes te&s;tified the joy &s;he took in Henry's good fortune, and &s;he ventured to predict he wou'd hear of further kind purpo&s;es in his favour, when he call'd upon Doctor Cawdle: <Q REND="inline">"For I know,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"that my Lady pa&s;&s;es many of her good deeds through his hands, and comes frequently to his hou&s;e, where &s;he has long private conferences, which my mi&s;tre&s;s us'd to be very curious about, and wou'd fain have &s;et me upon li&s;tening, if I wou'd have been concern'd in &s;uch &s;habby dealings: Very likely,"</Q> added &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"my Lady may in|tend to take you into her own &s;ervice, for I have been told that her footman is about to leave her, and &s;ettle in a public-hou&s;e."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Poh!"</Q> cried Ezekiel, <Q REND="inline">"her footman in|deed!

<P>Henry declared he found his ankle &s;o much &s;trengthened, that with the help of Ezekiel's arm he would undertake the walk. Dame May furni&s;hed him al&s;o with a &s;tout crutch-&s;tick, and thus &s;upported on each hand, he confidently &s;allied forth.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IV. There are Secrets in all Families.</HEAD>
<P>WHILST we leave our lame hero on his &s;low march to Zachary's ca&s;tle, we will inform our readers of a few particulars, re|lative to the lady we have lately introduced into our hi&s;tory, which may probably account for that air of melancholy, which Henry con|ceived he had di&s;covered in her looks.</P>
<P>Cecilia Vi&s;counte&s;s Crowbery was the daughter of Sir Andrew Adamant, a wealthy baronet of ancient de&s;cent. He became a widower &s;oon after her birth, and had no other child: &s;he was beautiful, accompli&s;hed, and with Sir Andrew's leave might be one of the riche&s;t heire&s;&s;es in all England. Sir Andrew was a lofty man, circum&s;pect in his oecono|my, and of a &s;eque&s;tered turn, living immured in his hereditary ca&s;tle, far di&s;tant from the capital, in the central parts of England.</P>
<P>At the county races the fair Cecilia, then turned of &s;ixteen, was permitted to make her fir&s;t appearance in a public a&s;&s;embly. A young cornet of dragoons, by name Delapoer, the
<PB N="230" REF="236">
cadet of a noble family, well known to Sir Andrew, had the honour of dancing with her. The graces of a fine per&s;on, engaging addre&s;s, and the flattering attentions he paid her in the dance, made a conque&s;t of her young and yielding heart. Sir Andrew could not alto|gether decline the honour of his vi&s;its, but that of his alliance he was in no humour to accept; nay, &s;o little di&s;po&s;ed was he to adopt the younger &s;on of a needy baron, that he peremptorily commanded his daughter never to name him in his hearing, nor even to think of him any more. The fir&s;t part of this command &s;he &s;trictly obeyed; the latter &s;he was &s;o far from complying with, that when all hope vani&s;hed of conquering his objec|tions, &s;he re&s;olutely overcame her own, and &s;et off with him on a tour to Gretna Green.</P>
<P>The &s;ame impetuo&s;ity of youthful pa&s;&s;ion, that drove them upon this de&s;perate project, hurried them into imprudencies in the cour&s;e of it: they were overtaken by Sir Andrew on the way, and Cecilia was torn from her lover's arms, in the la&s;t &s;tage of her journey, too &s;oon for the completion of the ceremony, too late for the re&s;cue of her innocence. The burthen of her woe encrea&s;ed daily, till it
<PB N="231" REF="237">
&s;welled to a &s;ize too big for concealment: Zachary Cawdle, then practi&s;ing in the neigh|bourhood of Sir Andrew, was &s;ecretly em|ployed in confidential &s;ervices, and a male in|fant, the hero of this hi&s;tory, was u&s;hered into the world.</P>
<P>Sir Andrew's di&s;cretion did not de&s;ert him on this trying occa&s;ion: provident in his mea|&s;ures, he took every means of attaching Za|chary to his intere&s;t, and binding him to &s;e|crecy. Cecilia travelled for her health, attended upon by him as family phy&s;ician. A tour upon the continent re&s;tored her to all the fre&s;hne&s;s of her maiden bloom, and Zachary had all the credit of a cure which nature ju&s;tly might have claimed &s;ome &s;hare in.</P>
<P>In the neighbourhood of Sir Andrew Ada|mant re&s;ided a very worthy clergyman, of the name of Ratcliffe, on a benefice which had been given him by the Baronet: to him al&s;o the &s;ecret was confided, and the infant left at his door as a foundling: he chri&s;tened it by the name of Henry, and brought it up with great care and tenderne&s;s in his own family. Had Sir Andrew been di&s;po&s;ed to have given his daughter to the Honourable Mr. Delapoer when her &s;ituation was made known to him,
<PB N="232" REF="238">
it was then too late, for that young officer had quitted his cornetcy of dragoons and betaken him&s;elf to India, where the intere&s;t of his fa|mily had procured him an e&s;tabli&s;hment, and all corre&s;pondence cea&s;ed between him and Cecilia. In about two years after the birth of Henry, Lord Crowbery paid his addre&s;&s;es to Cecilia, and was accepted by Sir Andrew, who gave him a con&s;iderable &s;um with her on the marriage, and at his death bequeathed his whole landed e&s;tate in tru&s;t to Cecilia and her heirs, in default of which it was to be at her di&s;po&s;al. It was now about twelve years that Sir Andrew had been dead, and from that pe|riod Lady Crowbery had privately remitted to Mr. Ratcliffe a liberal &s;tipend year by year for the education of young Henry; but in all this time, though &s;he had meditated on a variety of &s;chemes for gaining a &s;ight of her &s;on, &s;he had not yet found courage to put one of them into execution &s;ince the very year of her fa|ther's death, when Ratcliffe made her a vi&s;it at the family man&s;ion, on the pretence of bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and brought Henry with him, then a child of &s;ix years of age. On this occa&s;ion her maternal feelings were &s;uch as to expo&s;e her to very imminent danger, and effectually
<PB N="233" REF="239">
prevented her from hazarding another inter|view under the jealous eye of her Lord, who&s;e temper, after the death of her father, &s;oured by his di&s;appointment of an heir, and di&s;con|tented with the provi&s;ions of the will in her fa|vour, was &s;o totally changed, that from this time her life was made wretched by his treat|ment of her: the circum&s;tance of her elope|ment, which during Sir Andrew's life never once e&s;caped his lips, was now frequently ca&s;t in her teeth, and &s;ometimes with dark and di&s;|tant in&s;inuations attached to it, which &s;eemed to intimate that he was not without &s;u&s;picion of the con&s;equences that followed that event; and certain it is, that, in &s;pite of all Sir An|drew's precautions, whi&s;pers had been circu|lated about the neighbourhood at the time, un|favourable to Cecilia, which probably &s;ome &s;piteful tatler might have breathed into his ears, when it was under&s;tood among&s;t his hangers-on that any &s;tory they could pick up to the di&s;paragement of his unhappy lady, would be an office flattering to his ill-humour, and a &s;tep to his favour.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e terrors, &s;urrounded by &s;pies, and continually watched by a jealous tyrant, who never &s;uffered her to pa&s;s a day out of
<PB N="234" REF="240">
his &s;ight, it cannot be wondered at if Lady Crowbery had never ventured upon any pro|ject for indulging her&s;elf with a &s;ight of her &s;on, nor ri&s;qued the danger of di&s;clo&s;ing to a young man, of who&s;e di&s;cretion &s;he could have no po&s;itive a&s;&s;urance, the important &s;ecret of his birth.</P>
<P>When &s;he under&s;tood, from the &s;tory of what had pa&s;&s;ed in the village, that a young man had been carried before Ju&s;tice Blach|ford upon a fal&s;e charge, who pleaded to the name of Henry and none other, an anxious curio&s;ity tempted her to &s;ee him. Though &s;he had no rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect her &s;on had either left his faithful guardian, Mr. Ratcliffe, or been abandoned by him, yet the name he gave in with &s;uch an air of my&s;tery to the Ju&s;tice, (which had been reported to her) dwelt &s;trongly on her imagination, and the very fir&s;t glance of her eyes upon him in the cottage-kitchen revived in her memory the traces of tho&s;e features &s;he had once, and only once, fondly contemplated. Trembling with agita|tion, and fearful to provoke a di&s;covery &s;he had not &s;pirits to encounter, &s;he did not dare to a&s;k him any que&s;tions, more e&s;pecially be|fore witne&s;&s;es, but gave him her pur&s;e, &s;carce
<PB N="235" REF="241">
knowing what &s;he did or &s;aid upon be&s;towing it, till, upon better recollection, &s;he perceived there was nothing left for her but to e&s;cape as quickly as &s;he could, and refer him for what el&s;e might follow to her confidential friend, Doctor Zachary Cawdle.</P>
<P>Henry in the mean while was not totally without &s;ome faint &s;hadows of a recollection that he had &s;omewhere, and on &s;ome occa&s;ion, at a time long di&s;tant, &s;een her before. Of a Lady Crowbery he was pretty certain he had heard mention, though Ratcliffe him&s;elf pro|bably never named her in his hearing, for in matters of honourable &s;ecrecy no man living was more guarded. This idea however only floated in his brain, and he made no di&s;covery either to Ezekiel or Goody May of what was pa&s;&s;ing in his thoughts, though openings enough were given him by the talkative dame for enquiries on his part, had he been di&s;po&s;ed to make them.</P>
<P>Lady Crowbery ha&s;tened from the cottage-door to Zachary's, impatient to communicate to him her &s;u&s;picions that in the per&s;on of his &s;ervant Henry &s;he had di&s;covered her &s;on. <Q REND="inline">"It cannot be, Madam,"</Q> replied Zachary, <Q REND="inline">"the name deceives you: it catches your ear,

<P>Zachary unfolded the letter, put on his &s;pectacles, and read as follows:&mdash;</P>
<LETTER>
<P>Don't tell me of the army for my dear unknown; I cannot &s;pare him even to his country: Henry is the darling of my heart; a perfect deodand; and if his undi&s;covered parents now &s;hould claim him of me, I would defend my property in him with life and law, unle&s;s &s;ome tender weeping mo|ther was to pro&s;trate her&s;elf at my feet, as a certain petitioner did at Solomon's, and humbly pray for re&s;titution. As I am not quite &s;o wi&s;e a king as he was, I &s;hould not
<PB N="238" REF="244">
be quite &s;o cunning in my cruelty, for I would &s;ooner &s;ever my own heart than wound the &s;malle&s;t fibre in his beloved frame.</P>
<P>I'll tell you, my &s;age Doctor, what &s;ome|times occurs to me, in the pride of my heart: if I was not &s;uch an ugly fellow, as you know, and &s;uch a profe&s;t woman-hater, as you have &s;ometimes had the face to tell me, when I've call'd you over the coals for your wicked doings, methinks I &s;hould be tempt|ed to throw out a tub to the tatlers, and put my&s;elf upon the world for the father of this amiable foundling; but, alas! it is the only tub they won't &s;wallow, for they &s;wear I am &s;o frightful that no woman will come near me, and if any wou'd, they pretend to &s;ay I am too pious to let them. Out upon 'em! they know little of my per&s;on, and le&s;s of my piety; for I will maintain I am a great deal hand&s;omer than Socrates was, and not half &s;o virtuous. Now I dare &s;ay you ne|ver took me for wor&s;e than a heathen, and, to &s;ay the truth, I have often thought you very little better than one.</P>
<P>Henry has been eighteen years under my eye; if I was to &s;ay he has no fault, I &s;hou'd
<PB N="239" REF="245">
be told I made a mon&s;ter of him; you may &s;uppo&s;e therefore that he has faults, but I promi&s;e you I have never found them out. He is not indeed &s;o fat as you are, but that is his misfortune; in form and feature he is a perfect Apollo, but then he does not, like you, rival him in phy&s;ic; neither does he come near him in wit, for his talents are ra|ther &s;olid than brilliant, and he does not know how to rai&s;e a laugh at any man's co&s;t, for he has no powers of ridicule; in mu&s;ic he is &s;till further off, he touches the pipe a little, but it is not the pipe of Hermes, nei|ther is he fit to accompany the harp of Apollo. He has no memory; offend him, and he forgets to revenge it: he has no ta&s;te for intrigue, and tho' our rural Daphnes, peradventure, would not fly, he has no pa&s;|&s;ion for pur&s;uits of this &s;ort. He can't drink, or he won't, &s;o that he will never earn the character of an hone&s;t fellow, like you and me. He is the be&s;t hand in all the&s;e parts at &s;parring, but his art is of no u&s;e to him, for he won't quarrel. He knows Greek moderately well, Latin bet|ter, his religion be&s;t of all. I can recollect nothing that he does in your way, Doctor,
<PB N="240" REF="246">
except culling of &s;imples, for the very weeds of creation furni&s;h him with meditations on the wonders of the Creator: you deal with them in another way; electuaries, di&s;tilla|tions, and diet-drinks, are their de&s;tinies when they fall into your hands.</P>
<P>Such is my Henry. Is he fit to go forth into the world, who takes every man's word for his hone&s;ty? No, let him abide with me and ob&s;curity, till Providence opens a path in which he may walk with innocence and &s;e|renity.</P>
<P>I gave him his bapti&s;mal name, and call'd him Henry: I think he &s;hould have as many as his neighbours; what think you? If &s;o, let him be henceforth Henry Fitz-Henry!</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER V. Our Hero relates his Adventures. A religious Controver&s;y concludes with a Battle.</HEAD>
<P>OUR hero and his friend arrived at the Doctor's gate as Lady Crowbery's car|riage drove from it. Ezekiel &s;ate down in the &s;hop with Alexander Kinloch, whil&s;t Henry attended Zachary's &s;ummons up &s;tairs. He found the fat &s;on of Apollo &s;itting in his night|gown and cap, and was welcomed with many hearty congratulations for his e&s;cape out of the talons of the ju&s;tice, on whom Zachary be|&s;towed many opprobrious terms, which we have neither lei&s;ure nor inclination to repeat. He touched briefly upon Henry's leaving his &s;er|vice, but &s;o as to convince him he under&s;tood his motives, ob&s;erving by the way, that Mrs. Cawdle was now &s;o ill, that he apprehended her to be in danger; <Q REND="inline">"but &s;he will take no|thing,"</Q> added he, <Q REND="inline">"that Sawney Kinloch pre|&s;cribes
<PB N="243" REF="249">
to her, &s;o that &s;he has that chance for life &s;till; for my part, I'm in no condition to attend upon her."</Q></P>
<P>Zachary had made Henry &s;it down to re&s;t his leg: he now began his &s;tring of interro|gatories. Had he got any &s;ervice or &s;ituation in view? None. Would he come back to his old quarters? Henry &s;hook his head, bowed, and was &s;ilent. Ob&s;erving this token of di&s;|&s;ent, Zachary &s;miled, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;u&s;pect, young man, you have more hone&s;ty than good policy; I doubt you did not take proper pains to recommend your&s;elf to your mi&s;tre&s;s: the &s;aints pay well when they are pleas'd, and I gue&s;s you do not abound: Have you any money in your pocket?"</Q> Henry exhibited the pur&s;e, and named the donor. <Q REND="inline">"So, &s;o!"</Q> cried the Doctor, <Q REND="inline">"that's a great &s;um for a poor fellow; I &s;uppo&s;e you never &s;aw &s;o much money together before."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I have not always been in want,"</Q> replied Henry. <Q REND="inline">"Then I &s;uppo&s;e your parents may have fail'd, or come into trouble, or &s;tept a&s;ide, perhaps, and that may be the rea&s;on you don't chu&s;e to publi&s;h your name; but you need not fear me, for I am no tell-tale."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Nor I neither,"</Q> replied Henry. <Q REND="inline">"Humph!"</Q> quoth Zachary, <Q REND="inline">"I believe that

mo&s;t readily; but methinks it &s;hould be no rea|&s;on with you for refu&s;ing to confide in me, by which you might make a friend, and &s;uch an one perhaps as cou'd render you more &s;ervices than you may be aware of."</Q> He then proceed|ed to a&s;k, <Q REND="inline">"Had he a father living?"</Q> He had lo&s;t the only father he ever knew. <Q REND="inline">"I don't comprehend you,"</Q> &s;aid Zachary; <Q REND="inline">"was he not your real father? Have you no other name than Henry? Was you never called Henry Fitz-Henry?"</Q> The young man &s;tarted at the que&s;tion, and looked him earne&s;tly in the face. Zachary proceeded&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Did he know a clergy|man in the we&s;t of England, of the name of Ratcliffe?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Did I know him!"</Q> exclaimed Henry; <Q REND="inline">"his memory will be ever dear to me: whil&s;t he liv'd I never knew &s;orrow."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Good Heaven!"</Q> cried Zachary, <Q REND="inline">"is my friend Ratcliffe dead?

Oh, that I had been with him in his &s;ickne&s;s!"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Alas!"</Q> replied Henry, <Q REND="inline">"you cou'd have been of no u&s;e to him; his ca&s;e defied all art; his death was in&s;tantaneous, a fall from his hor&s;e; an unmanageable, accur&s;ed animal threw him from his back, di&s;located his neck, and in a moment extingui&s;h'd a life mo&s;t dear, mo&s;t precious, mo&s;t divine, if man can merit that

Ratcliffe I lov'd; he was the be&s;t of men; I know how dear you was to him; therefore you are dear to me; though he had more experience of your worth than I have, his obligations to you cou'd not be greater than mine are; for my life you have &s;av'd, and alas! alas! it was not in your power to &s;ave his.

As &s;oon as I had &s;een his corp&s;e committed to the earth, I found my&s;elf a &s;olitary being in the world,
<PB N="246" REF="252">
without a friend, without a name, without a parent that wou'd own me, or at who&s;e door I cou'd apply for &s;uccour and relief. The hou&s;e of my benefactor I neither cou'd nor wou'd abide in: I pack'd up a few clothes, and with what little money I had about me, &s;et out upon my adventures with a &s;ervant of my decea&s;ed friend, who was going to London. The army was the re&s;ource I had in medita|tion. Daily labour I was not u&s;ed to, private &s;ervice my &s;pirit revolted from, and a &s;oldier's mu&s;ket was at lea&s;t an honourable, though a &s;lender maintenance. On the road, it was my hard fortune to be attack'd by footpads: whil&s;t my comrade ran off, I &s;tood my ground, and made re&s;i&s;tance to the robbers; being &s;ingle, I was overpower'd by numbers, and left for dead, &s;tun'd with the blow of a bludgeon on my head. A pa&s;&s;enger had the huma|nity to take care of me, and brought me to his hou&s;e; he was a grazier, and held a farm on the &s;kirts of Houn&s;low-heath. I &s;oon re|covered from the blow, but I had lo&s;t my all; for the villains had &s;trip'd me even of the clothes I had on: with this man I pa&s;s'd a few days, did what work I cou'd in the hou&s;e as well as field, but there was certain work
<PB N="247" REF="253">
within doors which I wou'd not do, and falling under the re&s;entment of his wife, a woman of an outrageous temper, I was &s;o repre&s;ented to him, that he di&s;mi&s;s'd me with ignominy from his doors, pennyle&s;s and friendle&s;s. In this ex|tremity I call'd to mind a certain good old wo|man, who had been a &s;ervant of Mr. Ratcliffe's, and nurs'd me in my infancy, living, as I under&s;tood, at this very town hard by, where happily I fir&s;t met with you: thither I bent my cour&s;e, and the rather as I had a di&s;tant hope that &s;he could tell me &s;omething that might guide me to my parents, for I cou'd well remember being often told by her, when I was of an age to take notice of &s;uch things, that I was a gentleman born; that I had as good blood in my veins as the be&s;t man in the county, and &s;uch &s;ort of vague prattle as nur&s;es talk to children, and perhaps might mean nothing; yet it was a twig to catch at, and I had no better help within my reach. When you acco&s;ted me in the market-place, I had ju&s;t then enquired her out, and found my only hope was lo&s;t; &s;he had been dead &s;ome years. This with other &s;orrows will account for the de&s;pair you found me in; it was a &s;tate little &s;hort of ab&s;olute in&s;en&s;ibility; your voice
<PB N="248" REF="254">
recall'd me to &s;ome recollection; you re&s;cued me from total deprivation of my rea&s;on. What has befallen me &s;ince, I need not repeat; you know it all; and thus you have the faithful ab|&s;tract of my &s;hort but &s;ad hi&s;tory."</Q></P>
<P>The di&s;covery being now compleat, and Lady Crowbery's conjecture fully verified, Zachary took &s;ome time to reconnoitre the ground he was to go upon, before he ventured to advance a &s;tep. Having thrown him&s;elf back in his ea&s;y chair, and held a &s;hort council with his wits, he at length broke &s;ilence, and, with a gracious &s;mile, began by rea&s;&s;uring Henry of his favour and &s;upport. <Q REND="inline">"Heaven forbid,"</Q> he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"that one &s;o beloved and protected by his friend &s;hould be reduc'd to labour for his livelihood; he bade him think no more of that, he wou'd take his fortunes on him&s;elf; and as he was determin'd not to let him &s;ink from his former &s;ituation, the fir&s;t thing he recommended him to do was, to equip him&s;elf with &s;uch nece&s;&s;aries as he had occa&s;ion for, ready made up from the warehou&s;e at the neighbouring market town. Take &s;omebody with you,"</Q> &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline">"(either Ezekiel or the old woman) to &s;hew you the proper &s;hop, and rig your&s;elf out in gentleman's apparel; then let

<P>Scarce were the&s;e words out of his mouth, when a violent noi&s;e from the chamber of Jemima put a &s;top to all further conver&s;ation. The &s;ound was like the cra&s;h of gla&s;s, and it was followed by a loud and &s;hrill &s;cream, which conveyed to Zachary's ears the well known accent of his beloved's voice in its highe&s;t and mo&s;t di&s;cordant key. <Q REND="inline">"Ble&s;s us!"</Q> cried he; and &s;tarting from his chair, made his way as nimbly as he could to his con&s;ort's apart|ment, followed by Henry: upon opening the door the fragments of a gla&s;s bottle lay &s;cat|tered on the floor, &s;prinkled with a liquor which &s;aluted his no&s;trils with the veritable odour of Nantz: in another quarter of the chamber, Ezekiel Daw was di&s;covered with a wa&s;h-hand ba&s;on in his hand, the former con|tents
<PB N="250" REF="256">
of which he had &s;ent back to their proper owner, who, though drench'd with the polluted &s;tream, was foaming with rage, and preparing her&s;elf for another on&s;et.</P>
<P>As both parties were high in wrath and &s;trong in vociferation, it was not ea&s;y to collect any thing more of the fracas, than that the gla&s;s bottle had been vollied by the fair hand of Jemima at the &s;cull of the apo&s;tle, and he, with happier aim, had be&s;towed upon her the mi&s;cellaneous contents of the ba&s;on. There was little doubt that the controver&s;y had been of the religious &s;ort, though not conducted with all the temper di&s;putants on &s;uch a &s;ub|ject &s;hould pre&s;erve. The lady was evidently full of the &s;pirit, and Ezekiel's zeal, though not quickened by the &s;ame flames, was certainly not of the lukewarm &s;ort. He had been of|ficious in preparing her for the other world, and &s;he had done her be&s;t to &s;end him thither before her. Jemima contended for election and grace, which &s;he backed with the argu|ment of the brandy bottle launched at his head; Ezekiel preached regeneration, repentance, and a new life, which he illu&s;trated with the in|ference of the wa&s;h-hand ba&s;on. Had Jemima's &s;yllogi&s;m not mi&s;&s;ed its con&s;equence, it would
<PB N="251" REF="257">
undoubtedly have been of that cla&s;s, which cer|tain logicians denominate the knock-down ar|gument. Ezekiel's was applied <HI>ad verecundiam</HI>; rhetoric of a milder &s;pecies, yet not le&s;s effi|cacious, having reduced his opponent to a &s;ituation, in which any rea&s;onable per&s;on would have blu&s;hed at being &s;een.</P>
<P>The only way to make peace was to part the combatants, and this was done by Henry, who took his friend Ezekiel under the arm, and by force, rather than per&s;ua&s;ion, conducted him off the field of battle. The eyes of Jemima caught a glimp&s;e of him, whil&s;t en|gaged in this office, and that one glimp&s;e tended more to allay her rage, than all the &s;edatives, which Zachary's art could have ad|mini&s;tered; but this it effected by a revolu|tion rather than a reform; for whil&s;t it calmed one &s;torm, it rai&s;ed another: &s;he now grew mawdlin, and began to whine and whimper in a piteous &s;ort; the old woman was &s;ummoned to provide a change of clothes, and Zachary, glad to devolve his attentions upon Bridget, made a courteous exit, and retired to his chamber.</P>
<P>Jemima in the mean time proceeded in the ta&s;k of repairing the damages, which her per&s;on
<PB N="252" REF="258">
and apparel had incurred in her conte&s;t with the preacher, muttering revenge between whiles, and meditating projects for another in|terview with the youth, who&s;e appearance had encouraged her with hopes that he might yet be won to continue in her &s;ervice; and as no means &s;eemed &s;o likely to decoy him as a re|conciliation with Su&s;an, &s;he determined with|in her&s;elf in&s;tantly to &s;tart a negotiation for that purpo&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VI. Is any Merry? Let him &s;ing P&s;alms.</HEAD>
<P>WHILST Henry walked &s;lowly home|wards with his friend Ezekiel, he was fain to lend a patient ear to an entire recapi|tulation of the learned controver&s;y, which had, like mo&s;t other controver&s;ies of the &s;ort, ex|a&s;perated both parties, and convinced neither. The good man had now the whole argument to him&s;elf, and managed it after his own liking, without interruption, branching it out into &s;o many digre&s;&s;ions, and commenting upon it as he went on &s;o diffu&s;ively, that it may well be

doubted if his companion was one whit the wi&s;er, e&s;pecially as his thoughts were pre-en|gaged by the events that had pa&s;&s;ed in his con|ference with the Doctor. Ezekiel's new-birth, though &s;trongly in&s;i&s;ted on by him as the one thing needful in Jemima's de&s;perate &s;tate of health and morals, did not at that moment intere&s;t Henry quite &s;o much as the new &s;cene of things, which now &s;eemed opening upon him with more au&s;picious hopes than he had hitherto ventured to indulge. Nothing &s;truck Ezekiel with &s;uch &s;urprize, (as he frequent|ly remarked to Henry) nothing &s;eemed to him &s;o unnatural in the behaviour of Je|mima, as that &s;he &s;hould be offended with him for an act of kindne&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"to which,"</Q> added he, <Q REND="inline">"I prote&s;t unto you, I was mov'd by no other con&s;ideration than that of rendering her all the &s;ervice in my power; for, having heard that Mr. Kinloch had pronounc'd upon her ca&s;e, I came in pure charity and good will to ap|pri&s;e her that &s;he had not many days to live, and for this my friendly office the ungrateful hu&s;&s;ey treated me as you &s;aw; but &s;ome na|tures are not &s;en&s;ible of any kindne&s;s you can &s;hew them."</Q></P>
<P>When they arrived at the cottage, Dame
<PB N="254" REF="260">
May and Su&s;an had &s;pread the board with clean linen, and a homely, but comfortable, meal, and welcomed them with a &s;mile, that would have recommended wor&s;e fare. Ezekiel, who had the ho&s;pitality, though not the pur&s;e, of a bi&s;hop, gave a nod of approbation to the wo|men, and a hearty greeting to his companion. He then drew him&s;elf up to an erect po&s;ture, and, with much &s;olemnity, began a grace, that would have &s;erved for the dinner of a cardinal, and which held his me&s;&s;mates by the ears long enough to cool the meat and tantalize their hunger: a polite preacher might have di&s;|patched a modern &s;ermon in the time Ezekiel took to warn his hearers how they indulged their fle&s;hly appetites; which exhortation he had no &s;ooner fini&s;hed, than he cried out, <Q REND="inline">"Fall to, my good friends, with a hearty &s;tomach, and much good may it do you!"</Q>&mdash;an inference not exactly corre&s;ponding with the doctrine of the text, but probably better &s;tomached by the hearers than any part of it, and more readily obeyed.</P>
<P>When hunger was appea&s;ed, and the frag|ments &s;et by, Ezekiel, turning to his gue&s;t, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Methinks, friend Henry, thy coun|tenance be&s;peaketh a cheerful heart; and verily

it gladdens me to behold it; for the face of an hone&s;t man is the index of his thoughts. The maiden al&s;o, who &s;itteth be&s;ide thee, &s;eemeth to participate in thy good &s;pirits, which is to me a &s;ure token that I have not be&s;towed la|bour in vain upon her; for whereas the eye of the lover is &s;ullen and &s;ad, her's on the con|trary is bright and joyous: our good dame al&s;o is merry, and in &s;ooth &s;o am I; for I ex|perience &s;omething at my heart, which augurs better days: not that I complain of time pa&s;t in my own particular; Heaven forbid! I am thankful for my lot, and contented therewith. It is not the rich man's gold that is to be envied; it is his opportunity of doing good therewith that I covet; to cheer the widow's heart, to cheri&s;h the helple&s;s orphan, to em|ploy the labouring poor, &s;uccour them in &s;ickne&s;s, and wipe away the tear from the cheek of the mourner, the&s;e are the voluptu|ous enjoyments, the&s;e the real luxuries of life, which the great may revel in; this is their bed of down, their fea&s;t of dainties, and their flow of plea&s;ure. But do they not too often let the&s;e joys e&s;cape them? Alas, I fear they do! They give, indeed, but do they ble&s;s withal? They &s;catter to the importunate and unde&s;erv|ing

bounties that would give life to the in|du&s;trious, and people a whole neighbourhood. Oh, Henry! if ever thou art favour'd with the gifts of fortune, forget not, I conjure thee, that thou wa&s;t once the poore&s;t of the poor."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Behold, I am the favourite of fortune,"</Q> cried the youth, putting his pur&s;e on the table, <Q REND="inline">"and no longer poore&s;t of the poor, therefore hear me at this moment declare, that never in any future period of my life, whil&s;t I am po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd of memory, will I fail to bear in mind the &s;ad degree of helple&s;s penury in which this un&s;olicited bounty found me, and lea&s;t of all will I forget your goodne&s;s to me, my ge|nerous friends, your charitable protection in the hour of trial; and &s;ee! here are the means to add &s;ome comforts to this beloved circle, and yet provide me with all I am in want of."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What!"</Q> exclaim'd Ezekiel, <Q REND="inline">"&s;hall we do good to our fellow creatures and be paid for it by filthy lucre? Shall we &s;erve two ma&s;ters at a time, prai&s;e God with our lips, and wor|&s;hip Mammon in our hearts? Peri&s;h all &s;uch double-minded hypocri&s;y! be far from me &s;uch phari&s;aical eye-&s;ervice!

<P><PB N="257" REF="263">He now began to tune his voice to thank&s;|giving, and gave out Mr. Addi&s;on's beautiful hymn:&mdash;
<Q><L>When all thy mercies, O my God,</L>
<L>My ri&s;ing &s;oul &s;urveys.&mdash;</L></Q>
The chorus was now full, for both Henry and Su&s;an here could bear a part, as the words were familiar to them; and had not hone&s;t Daw and the Dame, in their zeal, effectually drown|ed the more melodious voices of the younger chori&s;ters, the concert would have been more tuneable than it was; but Ezekiel roared with might and main, and the old woman blew the trumpet through her no&s;e with &s;uch a twang, that the cottage echoed with the din, and to add to the cra&s;h, the cow-boy, who was then in the act of driving the pari&s;h herd from their common, hearing the chorus, put the horn to his mouth, and &s;topping directly before the cottage window, &s;ent forth &s;uch a determined bla&s;t, in malicious uni&s;on with Goody May's no&s;e, as had well nigh overthrown the gravity of Henry and Su&s;an, in &s;pite of all their re|&s;pect for Ezekiel, and the pious ta&s;k they were employed upon: very different was the ef|fect it took with him, for no &s;ooner had he
<PB N="258" REF="264">
wound off his cadence with the accompani|ment of the &s;aid cow-horn, than he &s;allied from his ca&s;tle, and angrily demanded of the lad what he meant by winding his horn in &s;uch a manner under his window, purpo&s;ely to di&s;|turb and ridicule him in his devotions.</P>
<P>The lad, who was brother to that John Jenkins, whom Ezekiel had taken to ta&s;k at the Ju&s;tice's, &s;tared at him with a contemp|tuous grin, and gave no an&s;wer. <Q REND="inline">"Do&s;t thou laugh in my face,"</Q> cried Ezekiel, <Q REND="inline">"thou un|&s;anctified cub? I know thee, Joe Jenkins, I know thee well, and all thy kin, for a genera|tion of &s;corners: fie on thee, reprobate! fie on thee!"</Q>&mdash;he was proceeding, when the &s;aucy rogue, without any apology, &s;lily put the horn again to his mouth, and turning it towards the orator, gave him &s;uch another dolorous bla&s;t in his ear, as drove him back into the cottage, almo&s;t deafened with the twang. What was to be done? The preacher was too much a man of peace to cha&s;ti&s;e him with his fi&s;t, and as for his tongue, loud though it was, it made no battle again&s;t the horn and the horn-ma&s;ter, who by long practice had acquired the art of giving &s;uch a tone to it,
<PB N="259" REF="265">
as nothing but the patient ears of a cow could &s;ubmit to be tortured with.</P>
<P>Here &s;ome of my readers may remark, that Henry ought to have turned out in &s;up|port of his friend; but they will be plea&s;ed to recollect, in extenuation of his omi&s;&s;ion, that he had &s;ufficiently &s;marted for his fray with the miller; that the &s;tocks were in his &s;ight, as well as his remembrance; and that he was at this very time &s;o di&s;abled with a &s;prained ankle, that he could as &s;oon have caught the birds of the air, as the nimble-heeled mu&s;ician: if none of the&s;e rea&s;ons will &s;uffice to exculpate him, I have none el&s;e to offer, except that he was ju&s;t now engaged in a conver&s;ation with Su&s;an, which though conveyed by the eyes, in a language not altogether &s;o &s;onorous as the horn, was not le&s;s intelligible, and pro|bably more intere&s;ting to both parties, than what was pa&s;&s;ing without doors: in &s;hort, there was an interchange of looks, which Goody May either did not under&s;tand, or under&s;tand|ing did not &s;ee occa&s;ion to interrupt.</P>
<P>It cannot be di&s;gui&s;ed, that Su&s;an May had thoughts in her head that did not entirely &s;quare with tho&s;e &s;elf-denying maxims, which Ezekiel Daw had piou&s;ly laboured to impre&s;s
<PB N="260" REF="266">
upon her: &s;he had the advantage both of years and experience over the youth, upon who&s;e heart &s;he &s;eemed to level her attack: three years of her life &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;chool of Mrs. Cawdle, who was her&s;elf no mean proficient in the arts of intrigue; and though &s;he had now renounced that &s;ervice, it may well be doubted, if there were not other motives for her making this &s;acrifice, than purely the moral merit of the act it&s;elf. Of her pa&s;&s;ion for Henry &s;he had given un|equivocal proofs, not only in her interview with him, which Weevil and his party broke up, but in that al&s;o, which Ezekiel interrupted. With a per&s;on uncommonly attractive, &s;he had a heart peculiarly &s;u&s;ceptible; and when &s;he repul&s;ed the attack of Ju&s;tice Blachford, it was probably more the re&s;ult of an utter di&s;|like of his per&s;on, than of any fixt and con&s;ti|tutional abhorrence of his propo&s;als. Such was her &s;uperiority over every girl of the vil|lage in point of charms, that not one among&s;t them could retain her &s;weetheart, if Su&s;an's eye once glanced encouragement upon him; but this &s;he &s;eldom conde&s;cended to, and then only in the way of a little &s;ly revenge for their &s;pite and malice again&s;t her; real liking &s;he
<PB N="261" REF="267">
be&s;towed on none; their clowni&s;hne&s;s, and her ambition, rendered her inexorable to all &s;uch &s;uitors; but to the graces of Henry's per&s;on &s;he had nothing to oppo&s;e; there was a traitor in the fortre&s;s of honour, that had he been di&s;po&s;ed to have &s;ummoned it, would have been found a very bu&s;y agent for a &s;urrender.</P>
<P>Hence it came to pa&s;s, that Ezekiel Daw had no &s;ooner bolted from his ca&s;tle to repri|mand the ob&s;treporous mu&s;ician, who&s;e ac|companiment had &s;o annoyed him in his p&s;al|mody, than Su&s;an May availed her&s;elf of the lucky interval to glance a look at her beloved Henry, that plainly &s;poke the di&s;po&s;ition &s;he was in to profit by &s;uch an opportunity, and the good will &s;he bore to the cow-boy for &s;upplying her with the pre&s;ent one, however &s;hort: it fairly told him, that if Ezekiel had not &s;o critically interpo&s;ed to re&s;cue her from his arms on a late occa&s;ion, &s;he could have found in her heart to have forgiven him, and would have met the con&s;equences without ac|cu&s;ing her ill fortune. Mirth and good cheer had warmed the heart of Henry; the chilling bla&s;ts of poverty were for the pre&s;ent di&s;|per&s;ed; Su&s;an's eyes were too plain-&s;poken for him to mi&s;s their meaning, and his &s;pirits
<PB N="262" REF="268">
too much exhilarated to be totally in&s;en&s;ible to the purport of it. Ezekiel, however, &s;oon returned, and the &s;cene was changed.</P>
<P>When the affair of the cow-boy and his horn had had its proper &s;hare of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, the party began to talk over the bu&s;ine&s;s of providing Henry with the nece&s;&s;aries he was to purcha&s;e; and it was determined to go the next morning to the neighbouring market town, which being upon the coa&s;t, and a port for &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, was furni&s;hed with all &s;uch articles as he was in want of, ready made: the di&s;tance did not exceed two miles, and Henry was of opinion he could walk thither in the pre&s;ent condition of his ankle, by the help of a &s;tout &s;tick, which &s;tood in the corner of the room, and was in fact the pa&s;toral &s;taff of the itinerant apo&s;tle Ezekiel, who al&s;o of|fered to accompany him, and render him his farther help by the way. Su&s;an, it may be &s;uppo&s;ed, was not backward in her tenders, and having been in the practice of making fre|quent purcha&s;es for Mrs. Cawdle at a certain &s;hop of all &s;orts in the afore&s;aid place, was a party by no means to be left out of the ex|pedition. The order of march was therefore finally &s;o arranged, that Su&s;an, under guard
<PB N="263" REF="269">
of Ezekiel and Henry, &s;hould &s;et out with the fir&s;t of the morning, leaving Dame May in charge of the cottage, and al&s;o to provide the meal that was to cheer them on their return.</P>
<P>A council was next held for lodging the company, male and female; and whereas their barracks were not quite &s;o roomy as might be wi&s;hed, it was not without &s;ome arguing pro and con, that it was at la&s;t &s;ettled, that the mother and daughter &s;hould occupy the bed in which Henry had repo&s;ed him&s;elf the night before; that Ezekiel &s;hould keep his own quar|ters in the cockloft to him&s;elf alone; and that a certain couch, which pre&s;ented it&s;elf as a &s;uc|cedaneum ready for &s;ervice, in Dame May's chamber, &s;hould be brought into the common room, and, with the help of a mattra&s;s, con|verted into a crib bed, for the &s;ole u&s;e and be|hoof of Henry their gue&s;t.</P>
<P>The&s;e regulations made and agreed to, the parties drew them&s;elves together in a circle round the hearth, where a few embers &s;erved to light Ezekiel's pipe, whil&s;t the Dame took her knitting and Su&s;an her needle, when a conver&s;ation en&s;ued, which &s;hall be recorded in the next chapter.</P>

Ezekiel, good man, had &s;trayed away from the topic they were upon in the true &s;pirit of digre&s;&s;ion, but having at length come back to the track, after a few whiffs for the benefit of recollection, he demanded of Henry, if he had rightly under&s;tood him, that the per&s;on who had taken charge of him, was a clergyman of the church of England?&mdash;Henry informed him that he was a clergyman
<PB N="269" REF="275">
of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, and one that was an ornament to his profe&s;&s;ion; an admirable preacher, a deep &s;cholar and a &s;ound divine.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Humph!"</Q> quoth Ezekiel.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"A man,"</Q> continued Henry, <Q REND="inline">"of exemplary morals, unblemi&s;h'd honour and a heart as gentle as the dew of heaven."</Q>&mdash;Ezekiel applied to his pipe with double diligence, and was enve|lop'd with a cloud of &s;moke.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Whil&s;t he liv'd I knew no &s;orrow; I had no other teacher; he was at once my preceptor, friend, and father."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I believe it,"</Q> &s;aid Ezekiel.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"He was &s;uch a friend as perhaps no father now di&s;|cover'd cou'd replace."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"None &s;uch, I dare &s;ay, will be di&s;cover'd,"</Q> replied Ezekiel: <Q REND="inline">"Are thine eyes darken'd? Do&s;t thou not at once di&s;cern that thou art I&s;hmael, the &s;on of the bond-woman, and like him ca&s;t out into the wilderne&s;s, to &s;eek thy fortune, without por|tion or inheritance?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"You &s;peak by allu|&s;ion,"</Q> &s;aid Henry, <Q REND="inline">"and I may not rightly interpret your meaning; but if you &s;uppo&s;e that I am the natural &s;on of that exemplary divine, you do me too much honour, and him great inju&s;tice; therefore bani&s;h all tho&s;e &s;u&s;|picions from your mind at once, and though I cannot expect you to reverence his charac|ter
<PB N="270" REF="276">
as I do who knew it, I do expect that you will not wound my feelings by &s;ugge&s;tions &s;o unworthy of it. Don't let me appear gap|tious by what I now &s;ay, but the re&s;pect which my experience of his virtues has engrafted on my heart, will not &s;uffer any &s;tain to be ca&s;t upon his memory; to him I owe the &s;en&s;e and conviction, of this and every other prin|ciple of rectitude and ju&s;tice; and if I deviate from it, the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion will lie at my own door: but I tru&s;t I &s;hall not &s;o offend again&s;t his in&s;tructions, as to grieve his departed &s;pirit; and as I have endur'd adver&s;ity with tolerable re&s;ignation and compo&s;ure, I hope, if it &s;hall plea&s;e Heaven to rever&s;e my lot, I &s;hall not be found wholly unde&s;erving of pro&s;perity."</Q></P>
<P>Ezekiel knocked the a&s;hes out of his pipe, and &s;ate &s;ilent in profound meditation&mdash;Su&s;an &s;ighed and kept her eyes fixt upon her work,&mdash;Goody May went on with her knitting, ob|&s;erving however by the way, that a mother who neglected her own offspring was wor&s;e than an infidel. At length Ezekiel, awaking from his reverie, remarked, that he had &s;ome|where read, or el&s;e been told, of a certain &s;on in the like my&s;terious circum&s;tances, who had either married his own mother, or had a child
<PB N="271" REF="277">
by her, he could not exactly &s;ay which, but he remember'd it was a very &s;hocking &s;tory.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Whichever it was,"</Q> Henry replied, <Q REND="inline">"it wou'd not be his ca&s;e; there was one &s;ure way to e&s;cape &s;hipwreck, by never going to &s;ea."</Q> Here Su&s;an glanced a look at him, which &s;eemed to &s;ay, Make no ra&s;h re&s;olutions.&mdash;Goody May in her natural manner &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Well, well! I can vouch for it you are not my &s;on."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Nor any body's relation in this company, I dare &s;ay,"</Q> added Su&s;an.&mdash;Ezekiel next, with much gravity, put in his prote&s;t again&s;t the po&s;&s;ibility of any claim being made upon him, for rea&s;ons which he &s;hould keep to him&s;elf; and concluded by &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"He did not doubt but the &s;in laid at the door of &s;ome high-born hu&s;&s;ey, for he believ'd from his heart there were many dark doings among&s;t them; few of them he fear'd were like good Lady Crow|bery; &s;he was a non-&s;uch, a pattern of pu|rity."</Q>&mdash;This led him into another digre&s;&s;ion, in which he took a circuit round the neigh|bourhood, which &s;et him down at the next door with Ju&s;tice Blachford, who, he ob&s;erved, was keen in &s;pying out &s;mall tre&s;pa&s;&s;es in others, and overlooking great ones in him|&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="278"><Q REND="inline">"Aye, &s;o the people &s;ay,"</Q> cried Goody May; <Q REND="inline">"but who believes them? Did not they &s;candalize my poor dear child, no longer ago than ye&s;terday, when Henry was before his wor&s;hip? I am &s;ure, if I thought any harm of Mr. Blachford in that way, I &s;hou'd not have li&s;ten'd to the offer he made me this very morning for my Su&s;an; yet &s;uch a place as Mrs. Locket's, the hou&s;ekeeper, for a young woman out of &s;ervice as &s;he is, does not fall to every body's lot: I am certain the late gentle|woman made a pretty penny by it, aye! and went as hand&s;omely the whil&s;t as the be&s;t &s;he in the county."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Went as hand&s;omely!"</Q> repeated Eze|kiel; <Q REND="inline">"what do&s;t thou infer from that, good dame, but that &s;ervants dre&s;s out of character, and &s;hew the world they either &s;pend more than they earn, or earn more than their wages?"</Q></P>
<P>A conver&s;ation was now &s;tarted between the Doctor and the Dame, which branched out into many di&s;cu&s;&s;ions not very edifying, were I to attempt the relation of them, in all which the hero of our hi&s;tory had little inte|re&s;t, and took no part: Su&s;an indeed could have told a tale of Ju&s;tice Blachford, that
<PB N="273" REF="279">
might have ended the debate at once, but &s;he was in the fir&s;t place under promi&s;e of &s;ecrecy, and in the next not in the humour to unfold it before the company pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Upon the whole it was plain, that although Ezekiel mingled much good rea&s;on with many oddities, yet the worldly advantages of a gainful place, and the &s;oothing mea&s;ures Blachford had taken to in&s;ure an intere&s;t with the mother of Su&s;an, had their due influence with her, notwith&s;tanding all that the hazard of the &s;ituation, or the &s;incerity of hone&s;t Daw, could object to deter her.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VIII. Love and Ambition are no Friends to Sleep.</HEAD>
<P>THE day was now clo&s;ing, and twilight faintly &s;erved to u&s;her the &s;everal parties to their repo&s;e; the couch was &s;pread in the kitchen for Henry, in which ta&s;k the fair hands of Su&s;an had the principal &s;hare; and Ezekiel a&s;cended to his loft.</P>
<P>All, who have experienced the effects of love
<PB N="274" REF="280">
or ambition, will acknowledge that neither of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions are endued with any &s;opo|rific qualities: whil&s;t Su&s;an's thoughts were kept awake by one, her mother's imagination was haunted by the other: the image of Henry &s;tretcht upon his pallet in all the cap|tivating bloom of youthful beauty formed a glowing vi&s;ion in the bu&s;y fancy of that fond dam&s;el, which bani&s;hed &s;leep: whil&s;t the warm imagination of the fond mother pictured her beloved daughter in the &s;tate and dignity of hou&s;ekeeper to Squire Blachford, with all the in&s;ignia of her office about her; the keys at her &s;ide, pickles and pre&s;erves, pre&s;&s;es filled with linen, and &s;tores of all &s;orts in her charge, with humble hou&s;emaids waiting to obey her nod&mdash;and re&s;t was no le&s;s bani&s;hed from her eyes. Each party being thus po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by her ruling pa&s;&s;ion, they proceeded to vent their meditations in a kind of dialogue, or rather of alternate &s;oliloquy, in which both exclu|&s;ively indulged their own favourite ideas, yet neither perceived that &s;he was talking to her|&s;elf.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, to be &s;ure,"</Q> cried Su&s;an, <Q REND="inline">"&s;ome people in the world mu&s;t be ab&s;olutely void of feeling; they mu&s;t be mon&s;ters in nature, who

<P><Q REND="inline">"Very true,"</Q> quoth the mother; <Q REND="inline">"and the more I think of it the more I am con|vinc'd, notwith&s;tanding all that Mr. Daw can &s;ay to the contrary, that it will be the wi&s;e&s;t thing you can do to clo&s;e with the Squire's propo&s;al. Why, lack-a-day! &s;uch offers don't come every day."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Search the kingdom through,"</Q> continued Su&s;an, <Q REND="inline">"you &s;hall not &s;ee a finer, &s;hapelier, lovelier figure in ten thou&s;and, nor one that, in &s;pite of his poor apparel, has more the air of a gentleman."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I dare &s;ay,"</Q> re&s;umed the Dame, <Q REND="inline">"that what with perqui&s;ites and pre&s;ents, and &s;uch like fair comings-in, you will make it worth you a good twenty pounds a year, aye belike, and more than twenty; why, 'tis a fortune, girl; and he &s;aid he would not haggle with you about wages."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I'll bet a wager, when he is dre&s;s'd in his new cloathes to-morrow, there will not be &s;o charming a fellow in this county, nor the next to it. Oh! mother, let preacher Daw talk till

<P><Q REND="inline">"No, to be &s;ure, girl, you are of an age to carve for your&s;elf; be&s;ides, what can he know of the&s;e matters?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nothing,"</Q> replied Su&s;an, <Q REND="inline">"nothing in nature; you heard him &s;ay he had rea&s;ons of his own why Henry cou'd not be his &s;on: O' my con&s;cience! I believe him, poor man; tho&s;e rea&s;ons of his are &s;oon gue&s;s'd at: he knows no more about it than this bed-po&s;t; nay, not &s;o much, for how &s;hou'd he come at it?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lack-a-day!"</Q> re&s;umed the dame, <Q REND="inline">"he is a goodly pious creature; but he forgets that young women have their fortunes to make."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Aye, and their plea&s;ures to pur&s;ue,"</Q> ad|ded Su&s;an, <Q REND="inline">"though, with his good-will, they &s;hou'd do nothing but &s;ing p&s;alms and hear &s;ermons; if he had his way, he wou'd be for locking us all up like nuns in a cloi&s;ter."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, well then, follow your own fancy, and don't heed what he &s;ays to prevent it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That's my good mother,"</Q> quoth the hap|py girl, nimbly turning her&s;elf about; <Q REND="inline">"i'faith I'll follow your advice, and not regard what
<PB N="277" REF="283">
he &s;ays to the contrary. A fine piece of work he made for&s;ooth about nothing, only becau&s;e the dear lad gave me a civil ki&s;s, and ho harm done!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I told him there was no harm,"</Q> rejoined the Dame, <Q REND="inline">"I told him he was too &s;trait-lac'd in tho&s;e matters; and I dare &s;ay, if the Squire offers at any &s;uch liberties, your own di&s;cretion will take care no harm &s;hall follow it; one wou'd not lo&s;e a friend for &s;uch little freedoms, &s;o long as they are inno|cent ones."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The Squire, indeed!"</Q> cried Su&s;an; <Q REND="inline">"name him not, filthy creature, I abhor and dete&s;t him, and had rather a toad &s;hou'd touch me than he; but Henry&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What has got in your head now?"</Q> replied the mother, &s;omewhat peevi&s;hly; <Q REND="inline">"I am talk|ing to you of Squire Blachford, and you are rambling about Henry: I am recommending a good place to you, and your thoughts run a gadding after the lad in the next room. Ah! Su&s;an, Su&s;an! thou wilt always be a gill-flirt, hankering and hankering for everla&s;ting after the young fellows, but don't forget the main chance, my girl; remember &s;ervice is no in|heritance; make hay, as the &s;aying is, while
<PB N="278" REF="284">
the &s;un &s;hines, and don't let a good thing go by you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It may be a good thing in one &s;en&s;e,"</Q> &s;aid Su&s;an, <Q REND="inline">"but there is a very bad thing be|longing to it. I know the Squire full well, and for what ba&s;e purpo&s;es he makes this offer: he wou'd have me be to him as Mrs. Locket was, whom he's tir'd of, but I &s;corn it; I wou'd &s;ooner beg my bread round the world with Henry than ride in my coach with &s;uch a na&s;ty, black, old, heartle&s;s wretch as the Squire. Ah! mother, mother, all his kindne&s;s to you is but coaxing and cajoling to make a fool of you, and &s;omething el&s;e of me. If you had but &s;een what he did ye&s;terday."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Why, what did he do?"</Q> eagerly exclaim'd the mo|ther, <Q REND="inline">"you frighten me out of my wits."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"'Twas well I frighten'd him out of his,"</Q> re|plied Su&s;an, <Q REND="inline">"by &s;creaming and &s;truggling, and forcing him to let me loo&s;e, or I know not what wou'd have happen'd; but I got out of his clutches, and made him let Henry out of the &s;tocks, or I wou'd have expos'd him to the whole neighbourhood. But now, mother, don't &s;ay a word of what I've told you, for I gave him my promi&s;e I wou'd not tell of it; nor wou'd I have open'd my lips, if you had not
<PB N="279" REF="285">
pre&s;s'd me about his offer, which I am &s;ure you wou'd not now wi&s;h me to accept."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not for the wealth of the world, my child,"</Q> replied the good Dame, <Q REND="inline">"wou'd I have you take a &s;ervice on &s;uch terms. Well, of a certain that man mu&s;t have the cunning of the devil in him, for he talk'd to me in &s;uch a &s;tile, that I no longer believ'd any one of the bad &s;tories that are told of him, but took them all to be mere &s;pite and malice; and when Mr. Daw talk'd again&s;t him a while ago, I took his part, and was angry with the good man for li&s;tening to &s;uch fables: Alack-a-day! what a world is this we live in!"</Q></P>
<P>Dame May had now got into the moralizing vein, the lulling quality of which &s;oon began to take effect; her words died away in drow&s;y murmurs, the vi&s;ions of ambition faded from her &s;ight, and the gentle god of &s;leep no longer needed &s;olicitation to befriend his aged votary after the accu&s;tomed &s;ort.</P>
<P>Half of his ta&s;k was &s;till unfini&s;hed; the bright eyes of Su&s;an were not &s;o willing to be clo&s;ed, nor could he &s;till the throbbing of a young high-pa&s;&s;ioned heart, which panted for other con&s;olation than his &s;oft quiet could be|&s;tow.
<PB N="280" REF="286">
The wanderings of fancy were not &s;o ea&s;ily allayed, and projects upon projects ro&s;e in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to puzzle and perplex her brain: but even meditation and the thoughts of love will yield at la&s;t to <HI>Nature's kind re&s;torer, balmy &s;leep</HI>; and though, perhaps, there were other arms in which &s;he would more gladly have re|po&s;ed her&s;elf, the love-&s;ick dam&s;el fell at length into the embrace of that delu&s;ive power, which has nothing to be&s;tow but dreams and vi&s;ions and unreal &s;hades.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IX. A dome&s;tic Scene in upper Life.</HEAD>
<P>LET us now &s;teal away with &s;ilent tread on tiptoe from the pallet of the &s;leeping dam&s;el, to vi&s;it the more &s;plendid but le&s;s peaceful chamber of the Lady Crowbery.</P>
<P>Upon her return from Zachary's, &s;he crept up to her room, hoping there to pa&s;s a few undi&s;turbed moments of private meditation, for her heart was full, and her thoughts un&s;ettled; in &s;pite of the letter &s;he had lately heard read
<PB N="281" REF="287">
to her, &s;he could not dive&s;t her&s;elf of the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion which the &s;ight of Henry had made upon her heart. In his features &s;he per&s;i&s;ted to believe that &s;he had recognized the picture, which memory had pre&s;erved of her child, matured but not obliterated by time; and the longer her mind pondered upon it, the &s;tronger her per&s;ua&s;ion grew, though again&s;t probabi|lity, that &s;he had di&s;covered her &s;on in the per|&s;on of this my&s;terious &s;tranger. His name, age, form, nay his very voice, &s;truck her ear as conveying the &s;ame tones, only deepened by manhood; in &s;hort &s;he &s;urrendered her&s;elf to this idea, which, like a &s;pell, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her &s;en&s;es, and di&s;&s;olved her into tears.</P>
<P>At this moment a me&s;&s;age from her Lord &s;ummoned her to his pre&s;ence: un&s;ea&s;onable though it was, &s;he well knew no excu&s;es for delay would be allowed, and &s;he in&s;tantly obey|ed. She found him with Blachford and two other per&s;ons, the one an attorney who ma|naged his e&s;tate, and the other a captain of marines, who bore his name, and was acknow|ledged as a near relation. Bloated by the flattery of the&s;e his con&s;tant &s;attelites, and &s;e|cluded from the re&s;t of the world, his pride, &s;elf-con&s;equence and ill-humour were without
<PB N="282" REF="288">
controul; and as nothing met his eye of which he was not the lord and ma&s;ter, he was be|come the de&s;potic tyrant of the &s;phere in which he moved. Blachford found it convenient to court his favour, for his property extended far and wide over the neighbourhood; and &s;uch intere&s;t as is attached to property he could not fail to po&s;&s;e&s;s, and did not &s;cruple to exert. Blachford's &s;mall e&s;tate was &s;urrounded by his lands and manors; the countenance of Lord Crowbery was al&s;o the more to be coveted, becau&s;e he lived upon very di&s;tant terms with every other gentleman in the neighbourhood. He had been giving the Peer an account of Henry, and the &s;everal circum&s;tances that had come out at his examination. In telling a &s;tory he had an art of &s;haping it to his purpo&s;es, and on the&s;e occa&s;ions any one might have &s;uppo&s;ed him to be upon the be&s;t terms with truth, &s;o free did he make with it. He &s;poke of his pri&s;oner's behaviour as highly in&s;olent and contumacious, and though of nece&s;&s;ity he had relea&s;ed him upon Weevil's evidence, yet he &s;till con&s;idered him as a &s;u&s;picious charac|ter; he ob&s;erved, that it was not impo&s;&s;ible but the whole might have been an artful collu&s;ion between him and Bow&s;ey; and though the
<PB N="283" REF="289">
law would not bear him out in committing him to pri&s;on, it was no rule to him in matters of opinion, and as far as that went, he for one could not bring his mind to acquit him of the guilt.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t Henry and Ezekiel were upon their vi&s;it to Zachary, Blachford had been with Goody May upon the &s;ubject of the hou&s;e|keeper's place, and by her he was told of Lady Crowbery's coming to her hou&s;e, and of the bounty &s;he had be&s;towed upon Henry. This he now good-naturedly imparted to my Lord, not willing that any of her good deeds &s;hould be lo&s;t, extolling her charity, but doubting as to the worthine&s;s of the object it was employed upon. Appearances, he confe&s;&s;ed, were apt to mi&s;lead, and in no ca&s;e more likely &s;o to do than in that of the young man in que&s;tion, who, he mu&s;t &s;ay, was one of the hand&s;ome&s;t fellows he ever &s;et his eyes on, and it was very natural on that account to feel a prejudice in his favour; he owned that he him&s;elf had ex|perienced it whil&s;t he had him under examina|tion; and if he, being a man, was &s;en&s;ible of it towards one of his own &s;ex, it was not to be wondered at if the &s;ofter heart of a woman was affected by it in the &s;ame, or even a greater degree.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="290">This was enough for all the &s;piteful purpo&s;es of Blachford; it was putting the match to the train of combu&s;tibles in the jealous bo&s;om of the Peer; who muttering to him&s;elf &s;omething not quite di&s;tinct enough to be clearly over-heard by his company, rung the bell and di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed a &s;ervant to his lady with the me&s;&s;age already reported.</P>
<P>Upon her entering the room he received her with a kind of ironical civility, expre&s;&s;ing his hope that &s;he had had an agreeable airing: he next enquired where &s;he had been? To the apothecary's&mdash;And to no other place? She re|collected having &s;topped at the cottage of Goody May. And didn't &s;he recollect any thing more than &s;imply &s;topping at her door? Cou'dn't &s;he recollect entering the cottage? Cou'dn't &s;he call to mind her own good deeds there perform'd, and the very generous method &s;he took of chearing the widow's heart, by let|ting her &s;ee how bountiful &s;he could be to a &s;tranger and a vagabond at the very fir&s;t &s;ight? The fame of her charity, he &s;aid, had circulated through the whole village, and their demands upon her in future could not fail to be very high; for what was there which the re&s;ident and indu&s;trious poor might not rea&s;onably expect
<PB N="285" REF="291">
from one, who had &s;o much to throw away upon the idle and unde&s;erving?&mdash;Her an&s;wer was very &s;hort. She was always &s;orry when her little charities were made matter of report; but &s;he perceived &s;he had &s;ome friend, (and here &s;he pointed a look at Blachford) who was not di&s;po&s;ed to let her &s;lighte&s;t actions pa&s;s un|noticed. She had indeed given a &s;mall matter to the young man, who had been apprehended upon a fal&s;e charge; and from the circum|&s;tances, which then appeared, &s;he thought her|&s;elf warranted to con&s;ider him as an object de&s;erving of her charity. <Q REND="inline">"Nobody can doubt of your lady&s;hip's motives,"</Q> replied my Lord with a &s;neer; <Q REND="inline">"and no object, if I am rightly inform'd, can be better qualified to &s;tir up the &s;oft &s;en&s;ations of charity in a female heart than the fellow in que&s;tion. I find he has been pretty &s;ucce&s;sful already in his &s;etting out; but now that your lady&s;hip has lent your hand to the good work, we may expect him to per|form great matters; whil&s;t you furni&s;h him with money and encouragement, he'll &s;upply him&s;elf with amu&s;ements among&s;t the wives and daughters of our pea&s;antry, to the great improvement of the breed, being, I am told, as perfect an Adonis as was ever carted to the

One of our young pari&s;hioners, it &s;eems, has been very charitable to him already, and left her &s;ervice for his &s;ake; I mean the daughter of that very woman, whom your lady&s;hip honours with your vi&s;its, and who at pre&s;ent conde&s;cends to inhabit a cottage of Mr. Blachford's, in which however I am in|clined to think her re&s;idence will not be of any very long duration, if my intere&s;t can obtain her removal; for my charity will not, like your lady&s;hip's, be addre&s;s'd to one worthle&s;s indi|vidual, but have re&s;pect to the community at large, by clearing it of this fellow and his clan, who are in a fair way, with your kind a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to corrupt the morals of the whole hamlet, if not &s;peedily driven out of it."</Q></P>
<P>To this no an&s;wer was attempted on the part of the lady; &s;he well knew the quarter from which the &s;piteful information &s;prung, and &s;he doubted not but this charge again&s;t Henry was equally groundle&s;s with all the re&s;t: &s;he was &s;ecretly re&s;olved, however, to a&s;certain the truth, as far as it could be di&s;|covered in Su&s;an May's particular; and now Blachford too late began to repent of his folly in &s;tirring any que&s;tion about that young wo|man's

conduct, who had &s;o much in her power to retaliate upon him: he gnawed his lips with vexation for having been &s;o flippant on a ten|der &s;ubject; but cunning fellows are very capable of outwitting them&s;elves. The cap|tain and the lawyer kept clo&s;e; and whil&s;t my Lord was meditating a fre&s;h attack upon the patience of his lady, a &s;ervant announced the arrival of vi&s;itors, in the per&s;ons of Sir Roger Man&s;tock and his daughter.</P>
<P>As our readers will have frequent oppor|tunities of making their own ob&s;ervations on the character of this gentleman, and al&s;o of his fair companion, we &s;hall in this place di&s;clo&s;e no more of either, than that Sir Roger was a per&s;on of con&s;iderable weight and influence in the county, living ho&s;pitably, and cultivating the good e&s;teem of his neighbours rich and poor. He had married a younger &s;i&s;ter of Lady Crowbery's mother, and by her was left a widower with an only daughter, I&s;abella by name, who now accompanied him on his vi&s;it.</P>
<P>We have &s;aid that Lady Crowbery's father left his e&s;tate in tru&s;t for her u&s;e, and this tru&s;t he devolved upon Sir Roger Man&s;tock, than whom he probably could no where have found a

fitter per&s;on, he being not only &s;trictly faithful to her intere&s;t, but as tenderly regardful of her happine&s;s as if &s;he had been a child of his own. Nothing but this love and regard for her could probably have brought him to the hou&s;e of the Lord Crowbery, who&s;e &s;ociety he di&s;|liked and who&s;e tyranny he dete&s;ted. He was now called over upon a matter of bu&s;ine&s;s; the news of Mr. Ratcliffe's death had reached him, and the bearer of that melancholy intel|ligence was him&s;elf a &s;uitor to &s;ucceed him in the living. As Sir Roger well knew the great e&s;teem Lady Crowbery had for the decea&s;ed, he did not think fit to broach his bu&s;ine&s;s in the hearing of my Lord or any of his com|panions; but having prefaced his reque&s;t with a proper apology to that noble per&s;onage, he retired with his niece and daughter to another apartment, and there di&s;clo&s;ed to her, with all the precaution in his power, the fatal accident that had befallen her friend, an event which, under any circum&s;tances, would have been highly affecting, but in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of her &s;pirits was peculiarly &s;o, combined as it now was with her &s;en&s;ations in regard to Henry, her mind being in&s;tantly &s;mitten with the con|viction that he was her &s;on. This incident,
<PB N="289" REF="295">
though unknown to Sir Roger Man&s;tock, pro|duced effects that could not be di&s;gui&s;ed, and he perceived her agitated to &s;uch a degree, that he no longer thought of leaving her, as he at fir&s;t intended, but very earne&s;tly de&s;ired &s;he would permit either him&s;elf or his daughter to &s;tay by her for the evening, if Lord Crow|bery would con&s;ent to give them hou&s;e-room.</P>
<P>To this kind offer &s;he thankfully acceded, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"You are always good to me, and con&s;iderate of my unhappy &s;pirits; knowing how unplea&s;ant a ta&s;k I impo&s;e upon you, I ought not to be &s;o &s;elfi&s;h as to accept your kindne&s;s; but I do confe&s;s the &s;ociety of my dear I&s;abella, if you can &s;pare her to me one day, will be a comfort above every thing in life; but if you grant me this, you mu&s;t add the further favour to it, and &s;peak to my Lord, for I dare not undertake it."</Q> She then a&s;ked &s;ome &s;light que&s;tions re&s;pecting the per&s;on who brought the intelligence, and this &s;he did for the purpo&s;e of introducing an enquiry more intere&s;ting&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Did he know what had become of the young man, whom Mr. Ratcliffe had adopted?"</Q> The Baronet replied, "That this had been one of the fir&s;t things in his thoughts,

knowing as he did the affection which the de|cea&s;ed entertained for that young man, but that he could learn nothing more from his enquiries concerning him, except that he had &s;uddenly di&s;appeared after the decea&s;e of his friend, and had not &s;ince been heard of.</P>
<P>This was a circum&s;tance that &s;eemed to her to carry conviction with it, and &s;he no longer doubted having di&s;covered her &s;on in the per|&s;on of Henry. It was now in her power to &s;ecure to him the protection of Sir Roger Man&s;tock, without revealing the more im|portant &s;ecret of his birth, to which no one was privy but Doctor Zachary; &s;he determined therefore to communicate to him the &s;everal occurrences that had been pa&s;&s;ing in the vil|lage relative to Henry, and concluded by &s;ay|ing, <Q REND="inline">"It will be a very &s;ingular turn of for|tune, or I &s;hould rather &s;ay of Providence, if it proves that I have di&s;cover'd this very foundling by the mere&s;t accident in nature, and that he is now in this pari&s;h, at the hou&s;e of a poor widow, where I chanc'd upon, him this morning, in a &s;tate of ab&s;olute di&s;tre&s;s and indigence: &s;hou'd he prove to be the relict of my lamented friend, I will take his future for|tunes upon my&s;elf, and in this undertaking I

<HEAD>CHAPTER X. Our Hero is &s;een in a very dangerous Situation.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;un had now rear'd his glittering orb above the ea&s;tern waves, gilding their curled heads with orient gold, when Su&s;an, eager to prepare for the appointed ex|pedition, broke from the bands of &s;leep, and unfolding to the god of day two brilliant eyes, who&s;e lu&s;tre &s;eemed almo&s;t to vie with his, &s;ilently detached her&s;elf from the &s;ide of her &s;till &s;noring mother&mdash;for &s;he, &s;weet nymph, di&s;dained the &s;elfi&s;h practice of tho&s;e unfeeling and ob&s;treperous beings, who &s;eem to think, when they have done with &s;leep, that all the world &s;hould wake: on the contrary with &s;teps as light as go&s;&s;amour, &s;he trode &s;lipper|le&s;s over the clay-bound floor, and throwing a loo&s;e bed-gown over her, fa&s;tening it at the &s;ame time with a &s;light knot round her wai&s;t, pre&s;ented to the &s;ylphs, if any were there at|tending, an object for which they would doubt|le&s;s have been content to have taken human forms, though they had forfeited immortality by the exchange.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="299">Thus half attired, &s;he rai&s;ed the wooden latch, that was the only barrier betwixt her and the beloved youth, who occupied the &s;olitary couch in the adjoining room, not entering like the nightly thief, with a malicious intent to &s;teal upon his defencele&s;s &s;lumbers, and plun|der him undi&s;covered, but for the harmle&s;s purpo&s;e of redeeming her own property, there depo&s;ited and left at his mercy, of which &s;he recollected various articles, that had e&s;caped her memory over-night, and which of cour&s;e it now behoved her to reclaim. She drew the chamber-door after her with duteous attention, &s;till cautious how &s;he di&s;turbed her aged pa|rent in the enjoyment of her repo&s;e, and for a time, as if fa&s;cinated by the charms of the &s;lumbering youth, &s;tood in fixt contemplation of his per&s;on, &s;eeming to have lo&s;t all me|mory of tho&s;e very objects, which &s;he came in &s;earch of. Two or three loo&s;e articles, not very e&s;&s;ential to her dre&s;s, &s;he had already collected, when ca&s;ting her eyes upon the couch, &s;he di&s;covered the &s;kirt of a &s;now-white quilted petticoat, which &s;he had im|providently &s;pread upon the very pallet, on which his limbs were &s;tretched, and which certainly could not be recovered, without
<PB N="294" REF="300">
wakening the &s;leeping youth, then bodily ex|tended upon it.</P>
<P>In this ca&s;e what alternative remained? It was clear to the dulle&s;t apprehen&s;ion, that a young woman without a petticoat could not decently pre&s;ent her&s;elf to the eyes of a whole market-town, where &s;he was &s;oon to appear: yet it could not be taken from under him by the mo&s;t delicate addre&s;s without wakening him, and at the &s;ame time he could not be awakened and made to open his eyes, with|out di&s;covering how much undre&s;t &s;he was, and how very thin the veil, that &s;carcely in|tercepted the entire di&s;play of tho&s;e natural charms, that &s;eemed to &s;et at nought the &s;light defences, which in her pre&s;ent dilemma &s;he had been nece&s;&s;itated to entru&s;t them to.</P>
<P>Native mode&s;ty and a ready wit &s;ugge&s;ted to Su&s;an the only middle way &s;he could pur&s;ue, in the &s;traits, to which &s;he was reduced: Henry him&s;elf was cloathed, if the jacket and trow&s;ers heretofore de&s;cribed, may be termed a cloathing; there was no need, therefore, for any guard upon her eyes, and &s;he no &s;ooner wakened him by tugging at the petticoat un|derneath him, than apologizing in a gentle whi&s;per for the nece&s;&s;ity &s;he was under of
<PB N="295" REF="301">
di&s;turbing him, &s;he concluded by mode&s;tly reque&s;ting him to &s;hut his eyes, for that po&s;i|tively &s;he was naked, having nothing to throw over her but her gown.</P>
<P>Whether it is in nature for a young man to &s;hut his eyes, when a lovely girl appri&s;es him of the con&s;equences of holding them open, I leave as a problem for the philo&s;ophers to re&s;olve; and as I &s;u&s;pect they mu&s;t, in the &s;pirit of their &s;chool, decree for &s;hutting out all pro&s;pect of an object, &s;o calculated to di&s;turb their &s;y&s;tems, as Su&s;an now pre&s;ented, it is with &s;orrow I am reduced to confe&s;s, that our hero did the very contrary to what they would have done, &s;etting open his eyes upon the dam&s;el, and fixing them with the broade&s;t &s;tare, betwixt &s;leeping and waking, that their lids would admit of. Whether he was then dreaming with his eyes open, and thought it the vi&s;ion of &s;ome nymph or godde&s;s, &s;uch as young and fertile imaginations are apt to feign, where no &s;ub&s;tance is, I cannot decide; but this I know, that had he been a painter, &s;uch as I could name, he had made the form immortal, and us who beheld it heathens and idolaters.</P>
<P>Su&s;an was too generous to repeat the cruel
<PB N="296" REF="302">
injunction &s;he had before laid him under, but on the contrary, having once told him what he ought to do, left him to take the con|&s;equences of not doing as &s;he advi&s;ed. Sa|gacious and deeply intuitive men often tell us, that there are certain things, ob&s;cure indeed to common beholders, which they can &s;ee with half an eye: this I pre&s;ume is a figurative way of &s;peaking, peculiar to the&s;e human lynxes; but without a figure I &s;hould be temp|ed to &s;ay, that any man who had even le&s;s than half an eye, would have &s;trained hard for a glimp&s;e of tho&s;e charms, which bur&s;t upon Henry's &s;ight in full di&s;play. The wrapping-gown was either &s;o &s;cantily provided, or &s;o ill di&s;po&s;ed to do it's office of concealment, that if form &s;o beautiful could be indebted to any covering, Su&s;an's form had very little obliga|tion to the afore&s;aid reluctant wrapper. Some readers may naturally &s;uppo&s;e, that either the &s;everity of Su&s;an's countenance over-awed the curio&s;ity of the youth, or that the mode&s;t con|fu&s;ion it expre&s;&s;ed, pleaded for his forbearance &s;o irre&s;i&s;tibly, as not to be with&s;tood by any but a brutal nature: had it been &s;o, Henry's ta&s;k had been ea&s;y and his temptation light; but, truth to tell, both were aggravated by
<PB N="297" REF="303">
every alluring action, every winning &s;mile that love and beauty could a&s;&s;ume. Here the philo&s;opher, who&s;e &s;toic apathy had turned a&s;ide from the &s;ight, may affect to triumph in his wi&s;dom, but it is now time to let him know, and learn by the example of this heroic youth, that true virtue, indignant of &s;uch mean re&s;ources, boldly dares to look upon the danger, which temptation plants before it; that, &s;corning to &s;helter it&s;elf like a coward in the dark, and &s;hut it's eyes or even wink upon the foe, it prays for light like Ajax, that it may &s;ee to conquer, and enjoy the glory of a combat fairly won: &s;o fared it with our hero; he boldly eyed the Syren coa&s;t, which he had re&s;olution to avoid. Perhaps &s;ome natural wi&s;hes &s;tole upon his heart, his pul&s;e perhaps no longer temperately beat, and rebel pa&s;&s;ion mutinied within him; but he was ma&s;ter of his &s;oul, and mildly addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the alluring dam&s;el, conjured her to return to her apartment, nor con&s;pire with opportunity and &s;trong de&s;ire to degrade him into a villain, and make him loath&s;ome to him&s;elf for ever.</P>
<P>The commanding tone of determined vir|tue is not to be re&s;i&s;ted. The fair one blu&s;hed, looked wi&s;hfully upon him; &s;he &s;aw no change
<PB N="298" REF="304">
or &s;hifting in his countenance; &s;he hung her head, &s;ighed, de&s;paired, and obeyed: yet be|fore &s;he took the parting &s;tep, &s;he pau&s;ed, looked back, and turning a countenance upon him, beautiful though in anger, firmly pro|nounced,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"We meet no more."</Q></P>
<P>The tone in which the&s;e words were ut|tered, the look that accompanied them, the cutting recollection of his obligations to her for the generous pity &s;he had &s;hewn him in his pa&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;es, the&s;e and a flood of tender pa&s;&s;ions bur&s;t &s;o &s;uddenly upon him, that &s;pringing from his couch (which at the &s;ame time broke under him with a horrid cra&s;h) he cried out to her to &s;top, and ran to take her in his arms. She had the door in her hand, and immediately the voice of Goody May was heard, crying out&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Villain, wou'd you violate my daughter?"</Q>&mdash;The&s;e dreadful words &s;truct the ever-open ear of Ezekiel, now de|&s;cending the &s;tairs, who in&s;tantly annexing conviction to the charge of the mother, added another &s;pectre to the groupe, &s;tanding &s;peech|le&s;s and agha&s;t, with a huge woollen night-cap on his head, and his breeches in his hand.</P>
<P>The tears, the terror, the di&s;hevelled habit of Su&s;an, &s;eemed to warrant the &s;u&s;picion of
<PB N="299" REF="305">
no wor&s;e a deed, than the mother had an|nounced. Ezekiel's lips quivered with rage, whil&s;t he demanded, in a voice almo&s;t inarti|culate, an account of what had pa&s;&s;ed; vowing that the violator of innocence &s;hould an&s;wer with his life. Henry now &s;tept forward, and directing a &s;tern look fir&s;t on the mother of Su&s;an, and next on the preacher, delivered him&s;elf as follows;"&mdash;</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Are you mad, to treat me in this man|ner, to accu&s;e me of the&s;e crimes, to &s;u&s;pect me for a hypocrite, a defiler and a villain? Is it ever to be my fate to be arraigned of actions, which my &s;oul abhors? Was it not enough to be apprehended for the murder of a man, in who&s;e defence I ri&s;qued my life? Mu&s;t I al&s;o be thought guilty of violating that cha&s;tity, which I would die in the protection of? If you conclude me &s;ubject to be tempted by beauty, can you not &s;uppo&s;e that I am capa|ble of being awed by innocence? Look at this form, he mu&s;t be a mon&s;ter that defiled it; &s;urvey the&s;e charms, they wou'd wither, they wou'd be bla&s;ted, and no longer have the power to engage and plea&s;e, were they &s;tain'd with di&s;honour and dive&s;ted of mode&s;ty.

their pure and virgin &s;tate, &s;o much the more revolting they wou'd become, if they had lo&s;t the grace of virtue, and degenerated from that cha&s;tity, to which they owe their &s;weetne&s;s and attraction. I am a &s;tranger to you both, it is true; I am a &s;tranger to my&s;elf; and all the little that I know of this unhappy &s;elf, I have imparted to you: what then? I am a man, I am your fellow-creature, I have like you a heart, that feels and has a &s;en&s;e of honour, ju&s;tice and gratitude. You have been kind and bountiful and ho&s;pitable to me; this amiable, this generous girl was my fir&s;t, my be&s;t, my warme&s;t friend: the indignity that I &s;uffer'd &s;he deliver'd me from; the &s;ervice that I quitted, &s;he voluntarily renounc'd; in my poverty and de&s;pair &s;he tender'd me her all, the earnings of her labour &s;he wou'd have &s;har'd with me&mdash;with me, an unknown, outca&s;t, mi&s;erable being: Are the&s;e bounties to be repaid by &s;eduction? Are they not rather charities, affections, pledges to be trea&s;ur'd in my heart? They are; I cheri&s;h them with equal love, with equal ardour and affection; and I declare to truth, that were I now a man, that had a name and &s;tation in &s;ociety&mdash;but as I am, I only can conjure her, for her own re|po&s;e,

to bani&s;h me and my &s;ad &s;tory from her thoughts for ever.

<P>This &s;peech wrought an immediate and entire conver&s;ion in the minds of tho&s;e, whom appearances had &s;taggered, and &s;hame for her ha&s;ty exclamation &s;mote the heart of the good dame &s;o forcibly, that &s;he &s;eemed to think &s;he could never do enough to atone for her injurious &s;u&s;picion. She declared &s;he &s;hould henceforward ever repo&s;e &s;uch perfect confi|dence in Henry's honour, as nothing &s;hould induce to harbour a thought to the contrary; that, &s;o far from being afraid to tru&s;t her daughter in his company, &s;he &s;hould, on the contrary, be happy that her girl had &s;uch a friend to protect and advi&s;e her; and &s;he &s;in|cerely hoped what he had now been &s;aying (which in her opinion, and &s;he dare &s;ay in Mr. Daw's al&s;o, was very proper and very fine) would have it's due weight with Su&s;an, and make her more guarded in her conduct for the future.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="308">Ezekiel, during this harangue, had &s;tept a&s;ide to equip him&s;elf with certain appendages to the per&s;on, which to man in a civilized &s;tate have by cu&s;tom long e&s;tabli&s;hed been held as indi&s;pen&s;able.

<P><PB N="305" REF="311">Few that make dre&s;s a &s;cience could have hit that happy &s;tile of nymph-like character which her un&s;tudied ta&s;te had &s;truck upon, in|&s;tinctively contriving to give every natural grace its faire&s;t form and fa&s;hion: in &s;hort, when perfectly accoutred, &s;he was a champion in the li&s;ts of love to make the firme&s;t heart tremble at the &s;ight of her; and though, in deference to Ezekiel's judgment, I mu&s;t ex|cept Potiphar's wife, yet, &s;etting her apart, I &s;hould doubt if Su&s;an had any other &s;uperior upon record for a <HI>coup-de-main.</HI> Malicious fortune was all the while laying other traps and pit-falls for the per&s;ecuted virtue of our youth|ful hero, and the pious preacher him&s;elf was unintentionally drawn in to be an acce&s;&s;ary in the plot; for having avowed his de&s;ign of edi|fying his hearers with a dehortatory di&s;cour&s;e again&s;t love and the indulgence of the pa&s;&s;ions on the next Lord's Day, he had accidentally recollected that Saturday had &s;tolen a march upon his memory, and that he was now upon the very eve of that important undertaking: in the mean time the more he ruminated upon the wide field of matter into which his &s;ubject would carry him, the more work he found cut
<PB N="306" REF="312">
out for his hands, and the more preparation on his part nece&s;&s;ary. He was aware he &s;hould have an audience to deal with not over-well di&s;po&s;ed towards edification on this particular topic, and rather hard of hearing at the be&s;t: he had kept a &s;ort of flying camp about the enemy's quarters, and frequently beat them up in &s;mall &s;kirmi&s;hes without much &s;ucce&s;s to boa&s;t of; they &s;till lay entrenched in their fa&s;t|ne&s;&s;es, lurking about in ambu&s;h behind walls and hedges, where they made battle, in &s;pite of all he could do to di&s;lodge them; he deter|mined therefore to draw out all his &s;trength for this one deci&s;ive &s;troke, and finally rout them out of their hiding-places.</P>
<P>Now this &s;tate of mental preparation ap|peared to him, upon reflection, &s;o totally in|compatible with his expedition to the &s;lop-&s;hop, and the inferences of coats, wai&s;tcoats, &s;hirts and breeches thereunto appertaining &s;eemed &s;o ill to cla&s;s and coincide with the ho&s;tile mea&s;ures he was actually concerting again&s;t the afore&s;aid coats, wai&s;tcoats, &s;hirts and breeches, that he plainly &s;aw both things could not be done at once, and which to aban|don gave him little he&s;itation to decide: he
<PB N="307" REF="313">
therefore came down to Henry, peremptorily prote&s;ting again&s;t the &s;lop-&s;hop and all which it contained. Goody May had the province of the kitchen purveyance under her care, and the pot to plead for her excu&s;e: Su&s;an had neither tho&s;e culinary concerns in charge as her mo|ther had, nor, like Ezekiel, any ho&s;tilities in meditation again&s;t love and the pa&s;&s;ions, with whom, on the contrary, &s;he was in perfect league and combination; &s;he was therefore no natural ally for Daw's purpo&s;e, and not wanted by her mother.</P>
<P>The alternative therefore was &s;imply this, either Henry mu&s;t go alone, or <HI>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</HI> with Su&s;an. Now what could Henry do by him&s;elf in a &s;lop-&s;hop? As far as coat, wai&s;t|coat and breeches went he might, peradven|ture, fit them on better without Su&s;an's help|ing hand than with it; that part of his bu&s;ine&s;s he might get through pa&s;&s;ably well, but in the linen-trade he was an arrant ignoramus, and the dam&s;el a con&s;ummate adept; &s;he knew to the breadth of a nail what was mea&s;ure for a &s;hirt, and the quality &s;he was no le&s;s perfect in;&mdash;he knew as much of the matter and no more, than the king of Pelew, (Heaven ble&s;s
<PB N="308" REF="314">
him!) who&s;e wardrobe will not fill a nut|&s;hell. Of cour&s;e, therefore, Su&s;an mu&s;t go, or nothing can be done; there is no choice in the ca&s;e; and where is the mighty objection all the while? The walk is not long; the day is fine and fair, and Su&s;an is ready dre&s;&s;ed for the expedition: Henry, alas! was but a &s;habby '&s;quire in point of apparel, but that was a fault which would be remedied before he came back, and nature had given him per|fections which poverty could not di&s;gui&s;e.&mdash;So forth they went together.</P>
<P>I hope my readers will not urge with any critical a&s;perity an objection to this jaunt of Henry's on the &s;core of his &s;prained ankle; if we are to &s;uppo&s;e him recovered from it, cures no le&s;s extraordinary have been as rapidly per|formed in hi&s;tories of this &s;ort, and I lay claim to all the privileges which my fraternity enjoy; but I had rather have it under&s;tood that his good-will to the walk with Su&s;an was &s;o great, that, notwith&s;tanding his cure was incomplete, he was determined, in the vulgar way of &s;peak|ing, to put his be&s;t foot foremo&s;t, and tru&s;t to fortune for the con&s;equences.</P>
<P>There were two roads to the town, one
<PB N="309" REF="315">
public and familiar to Henry, having travelled it with his ma&s;ter Zachary, when he got the drenching at the mill; the other private, &s;hady and &s;eque&s;tered, though &s;omewhat circuitous: which of the&s;e to take was now the que&s;tion. Love and Su&s;an &s;eemed to point to the crooked path; prudence and di&s;patch pre&s;cribed the &s;trait one. The candid dam&s;el fairly owned that her way would be the farthe&s;t about, but then it would be plea&s;anter whil&s;t they were upon it: &s;he put him in mind of his &s;prained ankle, yet &s;he hoped he felt no pain in it at pre&s;ent, her mother's recipe never failed of a cure: &s;he ob&s;erved that the &s;un threatened to be hot, and &s;he did not di&s;gui&s;e that &s;he was &s;hy of over-heating her&s;elf. Now how &s;hould pru|dence in the &s;un&s;hine &s;tand any chance again&s;t Su&s;an in the &s;hade? A penny-po&s;t-man, nay even pede&s;trian <HI>Powell</HI> him&s;elf, though in the la&s;t mile of his foot-match, would have taken the very path that Henry did, and readily have preferred the farthe&s;t way about to the &s;horte&s;t way home.</P>
<P>They &s;oon found them&s;elves entangled in a narrow defile between two hazel-hedges; when Su&s;an, pau&s;ing on her &s;teps, and glancing an arch look on her companion, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I can|not
<PB N="310" REF="316">
not for the life of me conceive, Henry, what you was thinking of this morning, when you was &s;o eager to get me out of your room: o' my con&s;cience, you was in &s;uch a twitter to be rid of me, that I began to think I &s;hould have been obliged to have left my petticoat behind me."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Had you &s;o done,"</Q> cried Henry, &s;miling, <Q REND="inline">"I can only &s;ay you wou'd have been more formidable to all beholders without a petticoat than with one."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Not to &s;uch beholders as you are, I &s;hould gue&s;s,"</Q> replied Su&s;an, <Q REND="inline">"in any ca&s;e."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, then,"</Q> re&s;umed he, <Q REND="inline">"to be more &s;incere with you, I did think my&s;elf bound in prudence not to hold you any longer in di&s;|cour&s;e till you had got that &s;ame petticoat on, and every thing el&s;e about you that cou'd keep us both out of danger."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh! now I under&s;tand you,"</Q> &s;he replied; <Q REND="inline">"you was afraid my mother wou'd come in, and that I &s;hou'd be in trouble on your ac|count. Lord love you! there was nothing to fear."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Pardon me,"</Q> an&s;wered Henry, <Q REND="inline">"there were your temptations and my weak|ne&s;s to fear."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I don't rightly comprehend what danger you was in from either,"</Q> re&s;umed Su&s;an, <Q REND="inline">"unle&s;s
<PB N="311" REF="317">
you hold with Ezekiel's opinion, that it is a &s;in to love."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I am not quite convinc'd,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"that there is any &s;in in love, but I am very &s;ure that love may lead to &s;in."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Yes, yes,"</Q> cried &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"I agree with you that it is very &s;inful and treacherous in any man to pretend love to a young woman, and after he has made a fool of her to expo&s;e and betray her; that's very &s;candalous behaviour, without a doubt. So is it an abominable thing for any man, like that na&s;ty Blachford, to &s;et his wits to work and lay traps for poor girls to bribe them to his wicked purpo&s;es, when he knows they mu&s;t hate &s;uch a black, old, ugly fright as he is, and only do it for the lucre of gain. I know enough of his wicked ways; &s;uch a man as he is does not de&s;erve to live: but where two free hearts meet together in mutual fondne&s;s, and where there is no bri|bery or fal&s;e dealing in the ca&s;e, but all is fair and open, and good faith kept on both &s;ides, I &s;hould be &s;urpriz'd indeed if you or any man cou'd per&s;uade me to think that there was ei|ther &s;in or &s;hame in &s;uch young people's lov|ing each other; and if they do love truly and &s;incerely, I de&s;ire to know in that ca&s;e what they are to do?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Marry,"</Q> &s;aid Henry;
<PB N="312" REF="318">
<Q REND="inline">"that is what they ought in honour to do, or do nothing."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Well to be &s;ure,"</Q> rejoined Su&s;an, <Q REND="inline">"that is one way; but &s;uppo&s;e it does not &s;uit them to marry, &s;uppo&s;e it's impo&s;&s;i|ble; what's to be done then?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Nothing,"</Q> replied Henry with a &s;mile; <Q REND="inline">"I've an&s;wer'd that already."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Heyday!"</Q> cried the gallant dam&s;el, <Q REND="inline">"that's a curious doctrine indeed, a fine way truly of returning evil for good. I &s;hou'd hate and de&s;pi&s;e the man that treated me in that manner; I &s;hou'd regard him as the poore&s;t wretch that walks the earth."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Why then we'll talk no more upon the &s;ubject,"</Q> cried Henry, <Q REND="inline">"but, like friendly di&s;putants, ki&s;s and make it up."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"'Tis more than you de|&s;erve,"</Q> an&s;wered me; <Q REND="inline">"for though I mu&s;t confe&s;s you are a dear good &s;oul, yet you have the odde&s;t notions of any mortal breathing; and as for love, you know no more about it than Ezekiel Daw."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"In&s;truct me then,"</Q> quoth Henry, <Q REND="inline">"for love, like dancing, is an art that grown gentlemen may be taught by an apt profe&s;&s;or, by a very expeditious proce&s;s."</Q></P>
<P>Plea&s;ant companions make journies appear &s;hort, and probably the&s;e young travellers found them&s;elves at the end of their's, before
<PB N="313" REF="319">
they were tired of each other, or of the way. In the &s;hop, which was a magazine of all &s;orts, Henry fitted him&s;elf with a mourning &s;uit of the be&s;t materials, not forgetting that mark of re&s;pect, to the memory of his decea&s;ed friend Mr. Ratcliffe: It &s;ate &s;o neatly upon his per|&s;on, that it &s;eemed as if &s;ome lucky taylor, in a moment of in&s;piration, had projected it for an ideal model of the mo&s;t perfect &s;ymme|try and proportion. Su&s;an was not idle in her department meanwhile, and as the la&s;t hand of the arti&s;t had been put to every thing, the whole man was equipt from heel to head in a few minutes, as completely as if he had &s;tarted ready capari&s;oned out of the earth, like the troops of Cadmus.</P>
<P>Our hero now felt him&s;elf once more re|&s;tored to that appearance in &s;ociety, which he had ever been accu&s;tomed to, till misfortune, and the villainy of mankind, had reduced him to the weeds of poverty: he was therefore moving in his proper &s;phere and character, and not &s;trutting like a lacquey in his ma&s;ter's cloathes. This did not e&s;cape the notice of Su&s;an, and her &s;agacity immediately di&s;cerned that natural and ea&s;y air, which no up&s;tart can counterfeit, the unalienable inheritance of a
<PB N="314" REF="320">
gentleman: &s;he now paraded over the market|place, not a little proud of her companion, and would not be put by from carrying him to her uncle the ton&s;or, who entertained them in his hou&s;e with much ho&s;pitality, no lack of good cheer, and plentiful &s;tore of chatter.</P>
<P>When all accounts were &s;ettled with the vender of &s;lops, and the packages put into &s;afe hands for conveyance to the village, Henry and his fair charge having refre&s;hed them|&s;elves with a beverage, which the ton&s;or had him&s;elf manufactured from the produce of his bee-hives, they took leave of their ho&s;t and turned their faces homewards, by the &s;ame way they had come, the &s;un being now ri&s;ing apace towards his meridian.</P>
<P>A form like Henry's cou'd not be quite concealed by the frock of a pea&s;ant, yet it was doubtle&s;s &s;et off to much greater advantage in the dre&s;s of a gentleman, and Su&s;an's eyes witne&s;&s;ed the plea&s;ure &s;he took in contempla|ting the change now made in his appearance. It al&s;o gave a flow to his &s;pirits and a freedom to his air, which gratified the gaiety of her nature, and made him more companionable and plea&s;ant by the way. Their di&s;cour&s;e was
<PB N="315" REF="321">
lively; her railleries were not gravely an|&s;wered as before, nor her playful coqueteries &s;o coldly overlooked: a thou&s;and little dal|liances took place, a thou&s;and harmle&s;s knaveries interchangeably pa&s;&s;ed, as they &s;aun|tered through the &s;hade; and ki&s;&s;es were &s;ome|times &s;natched, &s;ometimes evaded with a'coy|ne&s;s &s;o arch and &s;o alluring, as was better calculated to heighten her attractions, than to check his advances. She had plucked a wreath of blo&s;&s;oms from the hedges, which &s;he wove about her hat; he decked her bo&s;om with violets and wild flowers fancifully di&s;po&s;ed, which he was now permitted to arrange, now prohibited, as the whim prevailed. Sometimes &s;he would &s;top, expo&s;tulate, turn back, or run a&s;ide into the allies of the wood, and pretend to hide her&s;elf among&s;t the branches; this was a challenge for a pur&s;uit, and that never failed to be rewarded by &s;ome endearing favour, won with &s;truggles that enhanced it's value.</P>
<P>Their walk concluded, Su&s;an parted to the cottage, and Henry turned his &s;teps to the hou&s;e of Zachary, who&s;e portico, embelli&s;hed with a rich &s;ky-blue &s;croll &s;upported by two
<PB N="316" REF="322">
gilded gallipots, informed the way-faring man and the world at large, that there the mi&s;|chances of human life might be relieved&mdash;for there dwelt <Q REND="inline">"Zachary Cawdle, Surgeon, Apothecary, and Man-Midwife."</Q></P>
