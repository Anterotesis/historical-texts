<HEAD>A DESCRIPTION OF THE ROAD FROM LONDON TO BATH AND BRISTOL.</HEAD>
<P>THE Bath road is mea&s;ured from Hyde Park corner. On the right as we leave London, is Hyde Park, a park belonging to the crown; it is much frequented by tho&s;e who wi&s;h to take the air, either on foot, on hor&s;eback, or in carriages. In fine weather, it is generally crowded from two o'clock in the afternoon till five.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t village that occurs, as &s;oon as we are through the turnpike-gate, is Knight&s;bridge. On entering this place, oppo&s;ite the Park wall, &s;tands St. George's Ho&s;pital, an endowment for &s;ick and lame. A little beyond this, the road falls off on the left to Chel&s;ea and Fulham-bridge.</P>
<P>About half a mile from the gate, on the right, going out of Knight&s;bridge, is a new building, &s;tand|ing within the Park wall, built as barracks for the &s;oldiery.<MILESTONE N="1"></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">About two miles from town, is the village of Ken&s;ington; on the right as you enter it, is one of the King's palaces; the gardens to which are laid out in lawn and &s;hrubbery, and kept in good order, and are open certain hours of the day for people to walk in.</P>
<P>This &s;pot was formerly the &s;eat of the Veres, an|ce&s;tors of the Earls of Oxford, to whom it was given by William the Conqueror: it afterwards fell into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Lord Chancellor Finch, Earl of Nottingham; and was from him purcha&s;ed by William III. who built the palace. It has been the temporary re&s;idence of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Kings and Queens of England, from William III. to George II. who died there.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="2"> Going out of Ken&s;ington on the right, on an eminence &s;tands Camden Hou&s;e, once a noble re|treat, now a boarding &s;chool for young ladies.</P>
<P>The next hou&s;e on the right, who&s;e grounds ad|join Camden Hou&s;e; and near the turnpike, is a &s;tately Gothic &s;tructure, on the &s;ummit of a &s;pa|cious lawn, called Holland Hou&s;e; belonging to the Earl of Holland, and built by an ance&s;tor, in the reign of Elizabeth.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="3"> Near the three mile &s;tone we enter Hammer|&s;mith, a long and &s;traggling village, in which lives, a little to the left, near the church, the Margrave of An&s;pach.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4"><MILESTONE N="4"> A little beyond the four mile &s;tone is Turnham green; on the entrance to this place the road turns off on the left to Chi&s;wick; a plea&s;ant village, within a mile, on the banks of the Thames: near which is a &s;mall hou&s;e, built in the &s;tile of an Ita|lian villa, by the late Lord Burlington, now the property of the Duke of Devon&s;hire.<MILESTONE N="6"></P>
<P>On the right, at about half a mile di&s;tant, but in view, is a hou&s;e, called Gunner&s;bury Hou&s;e, built by Mr. Webb, &s;on-in-law to Inigo Jones; it was the property and re&s;idence of the late Prince&s;s Amelia, aunt to the pre&s;ent King.</P>
<P>A little beyond this, on the left, &s;tands Kew|bridge, cro&s;&s;ing the Thames, and leading to Kew, Richmond, &amp;c. in the county of Surrey. The road from London here, as far Colnbrooke, is in the county of Middle&s;ex.</P>
<P>We now enter the old town of Brentford, which, with the new town in continuance, is more than a mile in length. This town is poor, dirty, and &s;traggling; it &s;tands on the banks of the Thames; on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore of which, are the beautiful and royal gardens of Kew and Richmond, The &s;even mile &s;tone &s;tands at the corner of a &s;treet, <MILESTONE N="7"> leading into the road to Ealing and Uxbridge.</P>
<P>Brentford is a market town, and the county town, where the members for the county are cho&s;en, on a building erected for the purpo&s;e, behind the mar|ket hou&s;e. De&s;picable as this town appears, it
<PB N="6" REF="5">carries on a good trade with the metropolis, by means of the river, in corn, malt, and other com|modities.</P>
<P>In 1612, Charles I. beat his enemies at this place; and the Earl of Forth, commander of the Kings forces, was created Earl of Brentford, which title became extinct at his death, in 1651.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing the bridge, as we leave the town on the right, is the navigable canal from Uxbridge, &amp;c. that enters the Thames hard by.</P>
<P>A little beyond Brentford on the left, is the co|lonnade or gates entering the &s;eat of the Duke of Northumberland, called Sion Hou&s;e, from a mo|na&s;tery founded here, in 1414, by Henry V. Ed|ward VI. gave it to his uncle, the Protector, in 1547, who began to build this magnificent &s;truc|ture, the walls of which now remain. After the attainder and execution of this nobleman, it was confi&s;cated, and afterwards given to the Duke of Northumberland, and on his execution, in 1553, it reverted to the Crown: James II. gave it to the Earl of Northumberland and his heirs for ever. The hou&s;e is a quadrangle, of white &s;tone, &s;eated on the banks of the Thames.</P>
<P>Scarce do we pa&s;s this place, but we reach the grounds of an elegant villa, on the right, called Sion Hill, belonging to the Duke of Marlborough.</P>
<P>The road on the left, through a turnpike-gate, leads to I&s;leworth, Twickenham, and Hampton Court, di&s;tance about four or five miles.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6">Pa&s;&s;ing the eight mile &s;tone we come to Small|borough <MILESTONE N="8"> Green turnpike; on the left of which, before we reach it, bounded by a brick-wall, &s;tands, or &s;tood, Kendal Hou&s;e, once the re&s;idence of the Dutche&s;s of Kendal, a favourite of George II. and afterwards converted into a public hou&s;e.</P>
<P>From Smallborough Green we enter Houn&s;low; <MILESTONE N="9"> at the further end of which village, the two great we&s;tern roads fork off; that on the right, to Bath; that on the left, to Exeter and Cornwall. There is a very good road to Bath through Andover, or the Exe|ter road, not more than one or two miles out of the way, which is fully compen&s;ated by avoiding the hills, between Marlborough and Devizes, and the high charges at the different inns, on what is called the Bath road, which is the road mo&s;t fre|quented.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t beyond the 10 mile &s;tone, on the left, are <MILESTONE N="10"> the new barracks for the &s;oldiers. Houn&s;low Heath is a dead flat, of great extent, and, having no va|riety, we have as little to &s;ay re&s;pecting it.</P>
<P>Twelve miles and a half from London, a rivulet, <MILESTONE N="11, 12."> called the Crane, cro&s;&s;es the road, and north of it lies the village of Cranford, where there is a park at a little di&s;tance, abounding with wood and water, the &s;eat of the Earl of Berkeley.</P>
<P>The road beyond Cranford-bridge, is &s;till a level; <MILESTONE N="13"> on the right lies the Pari&s;h of Harlington, and near
<PB N="8" REF="7">it, Dawley; formerly in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Lords Bolingbroke and Tankerville, now the property of Edmond Stephen&s;on, E&s;q.</P>
<P>Arlington or Harlington, with Dawley, formerly the &s;eat of the Bennets, or Tankerville family, gave them the title of Baron, in 1663, which title be|longs now to the Duke of Grafton, de&s;cended by the female line, from the only daughter of John Bennet, Baron Arlington.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="14"> Sip&s;on on the right.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="15"> Harmond&s;worth on the right.</P>
<P>We now pa&s;s the pretty village of Longford, and the road becomes more plea&s;ant.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="16"> As we approach Colnbrooke, we catch occa&s;ional glances of Wind&s;or Ca&s;tle, on the left; about four miles di&s;tant.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t before we reach Colnbrooke, we pa&s;s the road on the left, leading to Staines, a merket town, about &s;ix miles di&s;tant on the Exeter road.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="17"> Colnbrook &s;tands on the river Coln, over which there is a &s;mall bridge. Part of this town is in Middle&s;ex, but the greater part in Buckingham|&s;hire. It has a market, a charity-&s;chool, and a chapel, founded by Edward III. and &s;ome good inns. This place is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the ancient Pontes. On the right of Colnbrook, is a &s;mall villa, called Percy Lodge, the &s;eat of the Earl of Tankerville, and was once the re&s;idence of Frances, Dutche&s;s of Somer&s;et.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="8"><MILESTONE N="18"> Langley on the right, where is a hand&s;ome &s;eat and park, called Langley, belonging to Sir Robert Bate&s;on Hervey, worth going to &s;ee, the adjoining land bearing the character of the &s;cenery about the Alps. It was &s;old to the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or by the Duke of Marlborough.</P>
<P>About two miles on the left, is the village of <MILESTONE N="19"> Datchet, in which was a bridge over the Thames, leading to Wind&s;or Little Park. It has now fallen to decay, and is impa&s;&s;able; and, being a Govern|ment bridge, it is uncertain when it will be re|paired.</P>
<P>After pa&s;&s;ing Colnbrook, in our way to Slough, the country on the left is more liverly, and Wind&s;or Ca&s;tle is frequently in view; al&s;o the town and col|lege of Eton, in the valley below it.</P>
<P>Upton about a mile on the left.<MILESTONE N="20"></P>
<P>Slough is a large village in the road, about a mile and a half from Wind&s;or. It con&s;i&s;ts of one &s;treet, and contains &s;ome good inns. Near this, on the left of the Wind&s;or road, leading from this place, lives the celebrated Doctor Her&s;chell. The apparatus which gives motion to his grand tele|&s;cope, is &s;een from the high road; his e&s;tabli&s;h|ment is at the expence of the King.</P>
<P>Wind&s;or Ca&s;tle has been a royal re&s;idence, with &s;ome interruptions, from the conque&s;t to the pre&s;ent time. William I. was the fir&s;t who built a palace here; Henry I. fortified it, and Edward III. en|larged
<PB N="10" REF="9">it. Eton College was founded by Henry VI. the chapel is a &s;tately Gothic &s;tructure, and may be &s;een from the road.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="21"> A little beyond Slough, on the right, near the road, is the temporary re&s;idence of the Earl of Che&s;terfield. Hence a road leads to Stoke, a vil|lage formerly called Stoke-Pogies, from its being the inheritance of the Lords of Pogies, from whom it pa&s;&s;ed to the family of Ha&s;tings. From this family it became the property of Lady Cobham, and was purcha&s;ed from her by Mr. Penn, of Penn|&s;ylvania, and is now in the hands of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. In Stoke church-yard is interred, the celebrated Poet, Gray.</P>
<P>Salt Hill has little more to be noticed than one or two good inns. To this place the Eton &s;cholars parade once in two years, to di&s;tribute &s;alt, and collect money of travellers, according to an ancient cu&s;tom.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="22"> On the right is the village of Farnham Royal, held by its pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or on condition of pre|&s;enting the King, on his coronation-day, with a right hand glove, and &s;upporting his right arm whil&s;t he holds the &s;ceptre. When the ance&s;tors of the pre&s;ent Earl of Shrew&s;bury exchanged this place with Henry VIII. they re&s;erved this privilege.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="23"> Huntercomb on the left. On the right Burnham, a village noted for an Augu&s;tine mona&s;tery, founded in 1265 by Richard, King of the Romans; clo&s;e to
<PB N="11" REF="10">this, in view of the Bath road, is a hou&s;e of Lady Raven&s;worth.</P>
<P>A hou&s;e on the left belonging to Mr. Ayres.</P>
<P>Hitcham on the right.<MILESTONE N="24"></P>
<P>As we approach Maidenhead-bridge the country <MILESTONE N="25"> becomes more picture&s;que, and we &s;ee, on the right, the woody hills of Taploe, belonging to the Earl of Inchiquin, where many genteel people re&s;ide.</P>
<P>On the &s;ummit of the hill, between the village of Taploe and the Thames, is the &s;eat of the Earl of Inchiquin, called Cliefden Hou&s;e. It was built by Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, in Charles I'&s;t reign, purcha&s;ed by the fir&s;t Earl of Orkney, and, by marriage, is now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Earl of In|chiquin. Frederic Prince of Wales, father of the pre&s;ent King, re&s;ided here in the &s;ummer.</P>
<P>Adjoining Cliefden is Hed&s;or Lodge, the &s;eat of Lord Bo&s;ton, &s;tanding on an eminence; below which, in the valley, is the &s;eat of Sir George Yonge, a hou&s;e lately built.</P>
<P>At Maidenhead-bridge, we enter Berk&s;hire, from <MILESTONE N="26"> Bucks. At the foot of the bridge, on each &s;ide, is a noted inn, and &s;ome gentlemens' hou&s;es on the Berk|&s;hire &s;ide, one lately built by Sir William Herne. The bridge is a hand&s;ome &s;tone &s;tructure, (about 15 years old,) built from a de&s;ign of Sir R. Taylor. From hence the beautiful &s;cenery of Cliefden, on the
<PB N="12" REF="11">right, and Wind&s;or Ca&s;tle and the fore&s;ts on the left, pre&s;ent picture&s;que land&s;capes.</P>
<P>Maidenhead is a town of &s;ome con&s;equence, its borough was founded by Edward III. and incorpo|rated by James II. The town &s;tands in the pari&s;h of Bray, to the left; and that of Cookham, to the right.</P>
<P>Adjoining Maidenhead, on the &s;outh, is the &s;eat of P. Pouney, E&s;q. an old hou&s;e, with a new park.</P>
<P>From Maidenhead, a hollow way leads to the &s;ummit of a hill; from whence to the north, the three villas of Cliefden, Taploe, and Hed&s;or Lodge, appear embo&s;omed in wood.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="27"> At a hou&s;e on the road, called the Folly, the road to Henley and Oxford branches off; to Henley 12 miles, to Oxford 30.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="28"> At the 28 mile &s;tone we enter the race ground, adjoining Maidenhead Thicket. On the right, near the edge of the common, is a hou&s;e, the re&s;idence of the late Charles Ambler, E&s;q. Solicitor General to the Queen. Towards the &s;outh are two hand|&s;ome hou&s;es, one belonging to Mi&s;s Lowndes, and the &s;maller to a Mr. Lee.</P>
<P>Here a road branches to the we&s;t, leading to Hall Place, the &s;eat of Sir William E&s;te, Baronet, about a mile di&s;tant. It has a beautiful park, but &s;mall. The eye ranging over the race-ground, to|wards the ea&s;t, may di&s;cover the &s;eats of John Grant, E&s;q. and Mr. Sayer.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="12">From a ri&s;ing ground, on the further &s;ide of the <MILESTONE N="29"> heath, we behold a fine wooded country, inter|&s;per&s;ed with farms, cottages, and here and there an elegant hou&s;e, the road running along hills and dales for &s;everal miles. On the left, between the 29th and 30th mile &s;tone, is the village of Shotte&s;|brook, where are the remains of a mona&s;tery of Be|nedictines, now converted into a farm-hou&s;e. In the church-yard here, lies the learned Henry Dod|well, who lived in this pari&s;h. At Lawrence Wal|tham, near this place is a field called Weycork, where &s;tood a con&s;iderable Roman fort.</P>
<P>Near Shotte&s;brook is a &s;tately man&s;ion, in a plea|&s;ant <MILESTONE N="30"> park, belonging to Arthur Van&s;ittart, E&s;q.</P>
<P>Beyond this &s;tone is the hou&s;e of Mrs. Phillips, <MILESTONE N="31"> commanding exten&s;ive views; and nearly adjoining, a hou&s;e with wings, belonging to Mr. Ximenes. Oppo&s;ite to this, near the road, on a &s;loping lawn, is the &s;eat of John Lee Parrot, E&s;q. on the ea&s;t and &s;outh of this, is a woody valley.</P>
<P>Hare Hatch is ju&s;t beyond the 32 mile &s;tone, a <MILESTONE N="32"> &s;mall &s;traggling village, with &s;ome good hou&s;es; particularly that of Mr. Young on the right, and Mr. Girdler towards the left. Here we leave the wood-land, and dip into an open cultivated country. About a mile hence, on a ri&s;ing country, <MILESTONE N="33"> on the left, &s;tands the village of Ru&s;combe; clo&s;e to which is an elegant hou&s;e, the &s;eat of Lord Chief
<PB N="14" REF="13"><MILESTONE N="34"> Baron Eyre; and a little beyond this we reach Twyford.</P>
<P>From Twyford there is a road a mile and a half to Wargrave, a plea&s;ant town, &s;ituated on the banks of the Thames, where the late Earl of Barrymore re&s;ided, and had an elegant theatre for his own amu&s;ement. Twyford was formerly a market town. Queen Emma gave it to the Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter; it was annexed to this &s;ee, till Bi&s;hop Poynet gave it to Edward VI. who granted it to Henry Neville. Queen Mary took it from him, and gave it to Bi|&s;hop White, Poynet's &s;ucce&s;&s;or; but Queen Eliza|beth re&s;tored it to Neville, and with his po&s;terity it has continued.</P>
<P>Twyford is a &s;mall town, about five miles ea&s;t of Reading, &s;ituated near the conflux of the Thames and the Loddon.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="35"> Beyond Twyford the road runs through a num|ber of rich meadows, watered by numerous &s;treams from the Loddon, which empties it&s;elf into the Thames, a little below the town, on the north. Further on, the road continues on a level for &s;ome di&s;tance; then a&s;cending, runs on an unequal ridge, through an enclo&s;ed, woody country, to the 37th mile &s;tone: it then de&s;cends towards Reading, which we &s;ee before us in the we&s;t, and Cave&s;ham Park on the right, beyond the Thames.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="36"> Sunning one mile on the right, and the hou&s;e of Mr. Rich.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="14"><MILESTONE N="37"> On the left is the road to London, through the <MILESTONE N="38"> fore&s;t and Egham.</P>
<P>Caver&s;ham Park two miles north of Reading, <MILESTONE N="39"> near the road from Thame to Henley, is the &s;eat of Mr. Mar&s;ac. The hou&s;e was built by the Earl of Cadogan, in the reign of George I. Lord Cadogan was created Baron Reading, in 1715; and after|wards Vi&s;count Caver&s;ham, for &s;ignalizing him&s;elf under the Duke of Marlborough, in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the Rebellion of 1715.</P>
<P>About two miles on his &s;ide Reading, a road, on the left, leads to White Knights, lately the &s;eat of Sir Henry Inglefield, now Mr. Neville's. It is a &s;tately building, in a plea&s;ant park. This place was one of the fir&s;t examples of the <HI>Ferme Orn&eacute;e.</HI></P>
<P>On the left, a little beyond this, one mile from Reading, is Early Court, the re&s;idence of J. Bag|nal, E&s;q..</P>
<P>A new road through Crambourne Chace, Wind&s;or fore&s;t, 18 miles in length, has not long &s;ince been made, by permi&s;&s;ion, through the plea&s;ant villages of Wingfield, Warfield, and Binfield, and from the number of elegant &s;eats on this road, and the beau|tiful &s;cenery about it, it is one of the mo&s;t delight|ful roads in the kingdom.</P>
<P>Reading, 39 miles from London, is &s;eated on an ea&s;y declivity, on the &s;outh-&s;hore of the Thames. The &s;treets are &s;pacious, and well-paved, and con|tain &s;ome good hou&s;es. The river Kennet runs
<PB N="16" REF="15">through the town in two &s;eparate &s;treams, and falls into the Thames, a mile below it; barges come up to the town by the river. It is the county town, is governed by a Mayor, 12 Aldermen, and 12 Bur|ge&s;&s;es, and &s;ends two members to Parliament. It has three pari&s;h churches, and is &s;aid to have been a borough &s;oon after the Conque&s;t. It was anciently in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Danes, who &s;urrendered it to the Saxons in 827.</P>
<P>A magnificent abbey was founded here by Hen|ry I. about 1124: Henry I. and his Queen were buried here. The abbey is de&s;troyed, but the Gate|hou&s;e is &s;till &s;tanding, and a venerable ruin it is. Here are two or three &s;tage coaches that pa&s;s and repa&s;s daily between this town and London, and one that goes the fore&s;t road. There is al&s;o a coach that goes three times a week from this to Oxford, 40 miles, and returns the alternate days.</P>
<P>Reading &s;tood a &s;iege in the civil-war, and made a gallant defence in favour of the King. It had once a woollen manufactory, but its trade con&s;i&s;ts now chiefly of malt, meal, corn, timber, and &s;ail|cloth. Manufactories of &s;ilk and lawn have lately been here e&s;tabli&s;hed, and meet with encourage|ment. Very little of the town is &s;een in travelling to Bath, the road pa&s;&s;ing only through one end of it.</P>
<P>In the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions we are told, that a &s;tratum, or bed of oy&s;ter-&s;hells, of 5 or 6 acres in
<PB N="17" REF="16">extent, was di&s;covered on Cat&s;grove Hill, near this town, a circum&s;tance worthy the attention of the natural hi&s;torian.</P>
<P>A little beyond the 40 mile &s;tone, on the left, is <MILESTONE N="40"> a neat hou&s;e of Mi&s;s Thomp&s;on's.</P>
<P>From a ri&s;ing ground at the we&s;t end of Reading, <MILESTONE N="41, 42."> the road runs along a ridge for two miles, yielding exten&s;ive pro&s;pects to the &s;outh. Here, on a hill to the north, is a hou&s;e embo&s;&s;omed in wood, the &s;eat of Edward Bower, E&s;q. and on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the road, on the right, near the 42 mile &s;tone, is the re&s;idence of J. Belgrave, E&s;q. It is a hand&s;ome building, with wings, &s;eated in a plea&s;ant park. The road on the north, is bounded with wood, and the river Kennet glides along the vale <MILESTONE N="43"> on the &s;outh. From this ridge, pa&s;&s;ing Calcot Green, we de&s;cend and approach Theal, which is a neat village, &s;kirted by the fertile meadows, and watered by the Kennet; beyond which a chain of woody hills terminates the pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>About a mile on the right, as we leave Theal, is <MILESTONE N="44"> Englefield Hou&s;e, the &s;eat of Richard Benyon, E&s;q. It originally gave name to a very ancient family, <HI>viz.</HI> Sir Henry Englefield. It was built by one of the Paulets, Marquis of Winche&s;ter; but re|duced and modernized by its late owner, Paulet <MILESTONE N="45"> Wright, E&s;q. a lineal de&s;cendant of that noble family.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="17">In the meadows, north of the Kennet, is a &s;quare entrenchment, &s;aid to have been thrown up when Earl Ethelwolf routed the Danes here, in 871.</P>

<P>Alderma&s;on on the left; near which is the &s;eat of the repre&s;entative of the third Lord Stawell.</P>
<P>Three miles ea&s;t of this place, once &s;tood Sil|che&s;ter, a Roman city of great note, called Vindo|mium, which covered 80 acres of ground. It was built by Con&s;tantine, in 337: there are now no ve&s;|tiges left but the walls and gates of the town, which may be con&s;idered as the mo&s;t perfect remains of Roman greatne&s;s in this i&s;land. On the north-ea&s;t &s;ide are the traces of an amphitheatre, now con|verted into a &s;traw-yard. Many Roman ways cen|tered near this place, which &s;tands in the county of Hants.</P>
<P>As we leave Woolhampton, the road ri&s;es to the &s;eat of Mrs. Crewe, &s;tanding on a ri&s;ing ground, about half a mile on the right.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="18">Midgham on the right; near which is a hou&s;e <MILESTONE N="50"> belonging to Mr. Poyntz. Before we reach the 51 mile &s;tone, there is a road to the right and left; the left leads to Brampton, the right to Midgham.</P>
<P>Beyond Woolhampton, a large tract of beautiful <MILESTONE N="51"> meadows &s;preads the valley on the left; and a chain of woody hills bounds the pro&s;pect on the right. As we get on, the road ri&s;es, and the grounds are more inclo&s;ed as we approach Thatcham.</P>
<P>Coldthorp on the left.</P>
<P>Thatcham, a &s;mall, neat town, of one &s;treet, Sir <MILESTONE N="52"> Arthur Crofts is Lord of the manor; who&s;e &s;eat is <MILESTONE N="53"> Dun&s;ted Park, which we &s;ee on the right, before we enter the town; it is a very &s;tately man&s;ion.</P>
<P>On the left, on the &s;outh &s;ide of the valley, the the &s;eat of Mr. Mount &s;tands con&s;picuou&s;ly.</P>
<P>From Thatcham the road runs along, up and down hill, till within a mile of Newbury; here it is more level and enclo&s;ed, and the country on both right and left, con&s;i&s;ts of woody hills, inter&s;per&s;ed with farm-hou&s;es; the river Kennet on the left.</P>
<P>Near Newbury on the right, is Shaw, the &s;eat of <MILESTONE N="54, 55."> Sir Jo&s;eph Andrews. It is a very ancient man&s;ion, <MILESTONE N="56"> much enveloped in wood. Here Sir George Li&s;le was po&s;ted at the &s;econd of battle of Newbury, in 1644. It was formerly the property of the Dole|mans.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="19">Newbury is a large populous town, 56 miles di&s;|tant from London, &s;ituated in a plain, watered by the Kennet. It ro&s;e out of the ruins of Speen, an old town, called Spine, or Speen; the remains of which now join Newbury. Hence the new town was called New Borough, or Newbury. Part of this place is called Spinham Land.</P>
<P>The &s;treets are &s;pacious, and well paved; and the market-hou&s;e is a hand&s;ome building: like Reading, this cannot be &s;een as we pa&s;s it, for the road touches it only at one end. It is a vicarage, in the gift of the Crown; and governed by a Mayor, High Steward, and 8 Burge&s;&s;es; but &s;ends no members to Parliament. There are &s;tage coaches from this place to London, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Newbury was once an ancient clothing town, but this bu&s;ine&s;s is now lo&s;t, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, by the Kennet having been made navigable here, and carrying on a trade more to the ea&s;tward. Here lived the famous Jack of Newbury, the greate&s;t clothier that ever exi&s;ted, having employed 100 looms, in his own hou&s;e, in the reign of Henry VIII. He marched to the battle of Flodden Field, at the head of 100 of his own men, cloathed and maintained by him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Newbury is remarkable for two battles in the Civil War, between the King and his Parliament, his Maje&s;ty commanding both in per&s;on: the fir&s;t was fought at the barrows, on the wa&s;h, two miles
<PB N="21" REF="20">&s;outh-ea&s;t of the town. In this battle, Sept. 18, 1643, fell, of the King's party, the Earls of Sunder|land and Carnarvon, and Lord Vi&s;count Falkland. The &s;econd battle was fought the year following, Sunday morning, October 27, 1644, by day-break, at Shaw.</P>
<P>Lord Portche&s;ter has an elegant and noble &s;eat at High Clere Park, in Hamp&s;hire, five miles &s;outh from Newbury. The hou&s;e &s;tands by the &s;ide of a very high hill, a di&s;tingui&s;hed object, and con&s;pi|cuous landmark.</P>
<P>From Newbury we proceed to Speenham Land, <MILESTONE N="57"> where are one or two very good inns. Speen was the ancient Spinae of the Romans, mentioned by Antoninus. It is &s;ituated on the Kennet, a little more than a mile we&s;t of Newbury, on the north road.</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ite Speen, in a valley on the right, is Don|nington Grove, the &s;eat of Wm. Brummell, E&s;q. It is a hand&s;ome building, partly Gothic, though lately built by J. Petit Andrews; by whom it was &s;old to Mr. Brummel, and may be &s;een from the road. On the hill to the north of it, are the vene|rable, ruined towers of Donnington Ca&s;tle, rearing its head above a wood of oaks. The Ca&s;tle was a po&s;t of great con&s;equence in the Civil War, and &s;tood a &s;iege of three weeks again&s;t the rebel army. This Ca&s;tle was al&s;o the re&s;idence of the poet Sir Geoffery Chaucer. Alice, daughter of Sir Thomas
<PB N="22" REF="21">Chaucer, &s;on to the Poet, married William de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk. On his attainder it came to the Crown; and was afterwards, by grant of Henry VII. given to Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk.

<P><MILESTONE N="62"> Ju&s;t before we reach the 62 mile &s;tone, on the left, &s;tands Barton Court, the &s;eat of Charles Dun|das, E&s;q. by which we pa&s;s to the village of Kint|bury, built on the &s;ide of a hill. At this &s;tone the road on the right, leads to Chilton Lodge, the &s;eat of Wm. Moreland, E&s;q. about a mile and a half from the Bath road. It may be &s;een before we reach Hungerford. This e&s;tate lies partly in Berk|&s;hire, and partly in Wilts; and the boundary of the&s;e counties divides the park.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="63, 64."> Between the&s;e two mile &s;tones, on the left, is Hungerford Park, the &s;eat of Mr. Dolbiac.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="22">Sixty-four miles and half from London we ap|proach Hungerford, by a &s;mall bridge over the river Kennet. It is a market town, con&s;i&s;ting of two parallel &s;treets. In the church lies interred Robert de Hungerford, the fir&s;t of that family in this county; who&s;e nephew, Sir Thomas, was the fir&s;t member of the Hou&s;e of Commons, 51&s;t of Edward III.</P>
<P>The Con&s;table, who is Lord of the Manor, is an|nually cho&s;en, and holds it of the Crown; they &s;hew a horn here, holding about 2 quarts, which, by an in&s;cription on it, appears to have been given by John of Gaunt; who procured a grant for the royal fi&s;hery in the Kennet, remarkable for its trout, its eels, and its cray-fi&s;h.</P>
<P>A little beyond Hungerford we enter Wilt&s;hire. <MILESTONE N="65"> Before we reach the 66 mile &s;tone, there is a road, on the right, to Chilton Foliat, and a little beyond the next &s;tone,</P>
<P>A road on the right leads through a noble avenue, <MILESTONE N="66"> near two miles in length, to Littlecot Park, the &s;eat of Mrs. Popham, about three miles from the Bath road; where a curious, large pavement was di&s;co|vered in 1730, two feet under ground, which &s;eemed to have been the floor of a temple, being 41 feet by 33.</P>
<P>Littlecot Park is in the vicarage of Ram&s;bury, where they pride them&s;elves in fine &s;trong-beer.
<PB N="24" REF="23">It is now a &s;mall village, but was once the &s;ee of the Bi&s;hops, who&s;e dioce&s;e was this county; but by the union of this &s;ee with Sherborne, by Herman, the eighth Bi&s;hop, it was removed to Sali&s;bury.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="67"> Froxfield, a long, &s;cattered village, on the road, about 2 miles from Hungerford. Here is a noble alms-hou&s;e, endowed by Sarah, Dutche&s;s of Somer|&s;et, in 1694, for 40 poor widows. It is a qua|drangle, with a chapel in the centre; they have each about &pound; 16 a year, with cloaths and fire.<MILESTONE N="68"></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="69"> Ram&s;bury, and Ram&s;bury Manor, the &s;eat of Lady Jones, is but a little di&s;tant from the road here, on the right; as is Great Bedwin on the left.<MILESTONE N="70"></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="71"> A road leads from near this &s;tone, on the left, to Tottenham Park, and Severnake Fore&s;t, which joins. Between the mile-&s;tones 71 and 72, the road enters this fore&s;t; and continues till we <MILESTONE N="73"> pa&s;s the 73 mile &s;tone; a delightful ride, we have then a mile to Margaret Street, and a mile more carries us through Marlborough, down a very &s;teep chalk hill, from the top of which we have a fine view of the town.</P>
<P>Tottenham Park and the Fore&s;t, is the property and &s;eat of the Earl of Ayle&s;bury. It belonged, formerly, to the Seymour family; but fell to Lord Bruce, by the marriage of Elizabeth Seymour, grand-daughter of William, Duke of Somer&s;et, with
<PB N="25" REF="24">the Earl of Ayle&s;bury, his grand-uncle. The fore&s;t with the park, is 12 miles round; and abundantly &s;tocked with deer.</P>
<P>At his di&s;tance from the capital, &s;tands the town <MILESTONE N="74, 75."> of Marlborough, on the &s;pot where antiquarians place the Cunetio of Antoninus. John, afterwards King of England, had here a ca&s;tle, which, on his revolt from his brother Richard, was taken by &s;torm; and in this ca&s;tle, a Parliament was held in the reign of Henry III.</P>
<P>Marlborough was a Roman &s;tation; and the &s;cite of the old Ca&s;trum was, by the Earl of Hertford, converted into a hou&s;e, and now into an elegant inn, at the we&s;t end of the town: the Keep is u&s;ed as a mount, for a &s;ummer hou&s;e. The town con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of one broad &s;treet. The &s;hops, on both &s;ides, are &s;upported in front by pillars, forming piazzas. It has two pari&s;h churches; and is governed by a Mayor, two Bailiffs, and 24 Burge&s;&s;es; but has no trade. It originally gave title to James Ley, Lord High Trea&s;urer, under Charles I. but becoming ex|tinct in that family, King William, in 1689, made Lord John Churchill, Earl of Marlborough; and Queen Anne afterwards, created him Marquis of Blandford, and Duke of Marlborough.</P>
<P>Proceeding from Marlborough, and de&s;cending <MILESTONE N="76"> a hill, a &s;hort di&s;tance from the town, a great num|ber of large, grey, &s;cattered &s;tones, are &s;een upon the down, on the right; the&s;e are vulgarly called
<PB N="26" REF="25"><HI>the grey wethers;</HI> they are a &s;pecies of granite; and lie on the &s;urface of the ground in great num|bers, and of all dimen&s;ions. They are loo&s;e, de|tached from any rock, and, as Dr. Stukeley thinks, have lain there ever &s;ince the creation; being &s;olid parts thrown out to the &s;urface of the fluid globe, when its rotation was fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="77"> Clatford Mill on the road &s;ide, and Fyfield on the left; and Lockeridge, where the Duke of Marl|borough has a hou&s;e.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="78"> We&s;t Overton on the left, on the river Kennet, which runs along the valley, on the road &s;ide. Be|fore we reach the 79th mile-&s;tone, the road ri&s;es, and enters the Downs.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="79"> Ea&s;t Kennet on the left.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="80"> We&s;t Kennet the road pa&s;&s;es through; a &s;mall village: not far above, the river Kennet has its &s;ource, which, as we have noticed, is made navigable, and running to Hungerford and Newbury, becomes a large &s;tream; and, pa&s;&s;ing by Reading, empties it&s;elf into the Thames, ju&s;t below the town. This river is famous for cray-fi&s;h.</P>
<P>Proceeding on to the 81 mile-&s;tone, we pa&s;s a &s;mall hill, or high tumulus, a barrow higher than general, called Silbury Hill, the large&s;t of this kind in England. It is of a conical form, 170 feet high, 105 feet diameter at the top, and more than 500 feet at its ba&s;e; having a trench round it, from
<PB N="27" REF="26">which this tumulus was thrown up. This hill has been dug into, and a human &s;keleton was found, bedded in chalk, which crumbled to pieces on touching; near it lay an old hor&s;e-bit, deer's horns, and an iron knife, with a bone handle.</P>
<P>At Abury, about a mile from this hill, on the right of the road, is the remains of a magnificent Druidical temple. A village has been built within its circle, and out of its &s;tones; the gardens and or|chards, &amp;c. have rather disfigured and concealed the great original de&s;ign.</P>
<P>The whole is &s;urrounded with an immen&s;e cir|cular rampart, or terrace, 60 feet broad; and a ditch within of the &s;ame breadth; the diameter is 1400 feet; the circumference 4,800 feet; and the area inclo&s;ed 22 acres; through the centre of which runs the high road from Marlborough to Bath.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t circle of &s;tones within this area, is 13,000 feet diameter, and con&s;i&s;ts of 100 &s;tones from 15 to 17 feet &s;quare; reduced, in 1722, to 40; of which, only 17 were &s;tanding, and about 43 feet a&s;under. There were other circles of &s;tones, like tho&s;e of Stonehenge, at pre&s;ent there are only a few &s;tones &s;tanding.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing the 81 mile-&s;tone we reach Beckhampton, <MILESTONE N="81"> a &s;cattered village, where the two Bath roads meet; that on the left through Devizes; that on the right through Calne and Chippenham. We will pur&s;ue this la&s;t road, and return to the other afterwards.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="27">Sandy Lane Road, which is the way to Chippen|ham, was the old Bath road, and turned off at She|pherd's Shore, beyond the 84 mile &s;tone; but a new road is now made through Calne to Chippen|ham, and this turns off at Beckhampton. There is an inn in the angle.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who wi&s;h to &s;ee Bowood, the noble &s;eat of the Marquis of Land&s;down, and Spy Park, the &s;eat of Sir Edward Bayntun, &s;hould travel this road.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="82, 83, 84."> Pa&s;&s;ing the ridge, on which the road winds, we de&s;cend into a flat, cultivated country, leaving White Hor&s;e Hill on the left.</P>
<P>White Hor&s;e Hill takes its name from the figure of a hor&s;e hollowed out in the chalk, on that &s;ide next the road. It is &s;o large as to be &s;een at a great di&s;tance; and was cut in memory of the victory, obtained by Alfred, over the Danes, near Edding|ton, in the year 878. The figure is 54 feet from the toe to the che&s;t, 100 feet from the toe to the point of the ear, and 100 feet from ear to tail. This battle was fought near the village of Edding|ton, where the Dani&s;h army was encamped.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="85"> Pa&s;&s;ing Cherhill, which lies clo&s;e on the right &s;ide of the road, and where we quit the Downs, at the 85 mile &s;tone, a road leads to Compton Hou&s;e, the &s;eat of J. W. Henneage, E&s;q. about a mile and a half north-ea&s;t of Calne.</P>
<P>From the village of Cherhill, we pa&s;s over Cum|merford <MILESTONE N="86"> Common; and, at the 86 mile-&s;tone, on
<PB N="29" REF="28">the left, &s;tands Blacklands, the &s;eat of Mr. Maun|drell; and, before we reach the 87 mile-&s;tone, we cro&s;s a &s;tream at the village of Cummerford, on which there are &s;everal cloth and corn mills.</P>
<P>Another half mile brings us to Calne, a &s;mall <MILESTONE N="87"> neat town, &s;ituated on a &s;tony hill; with a hand|&s;ome church, built of free&s;tone. This town is well &s;upplied with water from Cherhill, and al&s;o from a &s;tream at Cal&s;ton, on the left, where &s;everal &s;treams may be &s;een, beautifully gu&s;hing from the &s;ide of the hill, and forming one &s;tream, &s;ufficient to work a corn-mill below.</P>
<P>At the entrance of Calne, (by order of the Mar|quis of Lan&s;down,) the old hou&s;es have been pulled down, and &s;mall neat hou&s;es, for the poor, erected in their &s;tead. It is a town of great antiquity, and has &s;ent members to parliament &s;ince the 26th of Edward I.</P>
<P>Here &s;tood a palace of the Saxon Kings; and, in the controver&s;y between the Monks and the Prie&s;ts, re&s;pecting the celibacy of the clergy, a grand coun|cil was held here, in 977; and, during the debate, the floor of the chamber gave way, and many were killed; Dun&s;tan, who pre&s;ided, and who favoured the Monks, e&s;caped unhurt, which they conceived as a miracle that confirmed the Monki&s;h Law.</P>
<P>Calne is a market town, and contains near 3000 inhabitants, and con&s;iderable manufactories of cloth, &s;erges, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="29">About a quarter of a mile from Calne, on the right, is &s;een the principal entrance to Bowood, from the London &s;ide. Bowood Park was once a royal one, and part of the jointure of Catherine Parr, widow of Henry VIII. James I. if &s;aid to have hunted here; at which time all the country, on the left of the road, from Calne to Chippenham, was a continued fore&s;t; afterwards divided, by grant, between the ance&s;tors of Lord Audley and Mr. Carey, an ancient Roman Catholic family, in Devon&s;hire; which la&s;t has lately been purcha&s;ed by Mr. Montague, of Lackham; about 4 miles di&s;tant.</P>
<P>Bowood was di&s;parked in the time of Oliver Cromwell, and granted, for ever, to Sir Orlando Bridgman, a favourite of Charles II. Sir Orlando dying in&s;olvent, the late Earl of Shelburne bought it of his creditors. To a hou&s;e of 80 feet in front, the late Lord added offices of 300 feet in front, and fronted and enclo&s;ed the&s;e offices with a colonnade, taken from a part of Diocle&s;ians palace, at Spalatro, in Dalmatia; the &s;eats in the garden were chiefly taken from the Herculaneum. Within the park is a fine menagerie of wild bea&s;ts.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="88"> On the left of the road is Pin Hills, formerly a gentleman's &s;eat, now a farm, belonging to Bowood; and Bromhill, a plantation of Lord Lan&s;down, on the right.</P>

<P>One mile from this place &s;tands Spy Park, the &s;eat of Sir Edward Bayntun; &s;eparated from the enclo&s;ures of Bowood by the old Bath road, through Sandy Lane, 90 miles from London. Adjoining Spy Park is Rowden Hou&s;e, the &s;eat of E. Dicken|&s;on, E&s;q.</P>
<P>Continuing the Bath road, between Pin hills and Bromhill, we de&s;cend into a valley.</P>

<P>Chippenham, &s;ituated on the river Avon, is a <MILESTONE N="93"> large market town, 93 miles from London. It was the &s;eat of &s;everal of the Saxon Kings, and be|queathed by Alfred to one of his daughters. The Danes fled twice here from Alfred, but gave it up

<P>Leaving Chippenham, we travel through a plea|&s;ant country; but, before we reach the 95 mile|&s;tone, we a&s;cend a hill, and the road winds along its northern &s;ide; beyond this we ri&s;e again, and reach Cor&s;ham.</P>

<P>Cor&s;ham is a &s;mall near town, &s;tanding on a flat. Ethelred, the Saxon King, had a palace here; and it was the &s;eat of &s;everal of the Earls of Cornwall.

<P><PB N="34" REF="35"><MILESTONE N="103"> Bathmill, and Bathford Village, on the left: the &s;ides of the hills here, on both &s;ides, are richly de|corated with wood, and beautiful meadows. The road now &s;unk into the bottom, we cro&s;s the &s;tream, which, a little farther, falls into the Avon, at Bath|ford. From this we travel along the bank, with the river on our left, till we reach</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="104"> Bath Ea&s;ton, which, with Walcot, may be con|&s;idered as the &s;uburbs of Bath. At Bath Ea&s;ton, on the right, is a hand&s;ome hou&s;e, the country re|&s;idence of Sir John Miller; the entrance to it is embelli&s;hed with noble cedars, of extraordinary growth and beauty.</P>
<P>As we approach Bath, delightful pro&s;pects meet the eye; to the we&s;t, the city; on the left, the High Ground, le&s;s &s;ecured with wood on the ea&s;t, a rich valley, with a lofty ridge, protecting it from the north.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="105"> Bath Hampton, on the left, beyond the river.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="106"> Bath Wick, beyond the river.</P>
<P>Before we proceed further, we will turn back, and de&s;cribe the road to Bath through Devizes, from Beckhampton, where it branched off on Marl|borough Downs to Calne; a little beyond the 81 mile &s;tone.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="82, 83, 84."> From Beckhampton Inn, the road winds along the ea&s;tern verge of this Down, which divides it from the road to Calne.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="36">A little beyond the 84 mile-&s;tone, at a place called Shepherd's Shard, or Shore, the Devizes road turns off on the left.</P>
<P>At Shepherd's Shore we cro&s;s Wan&s;dike, which is another &s;tupendous monument of antiquity, a fo&s;s made in the time of the Romans, as one of the boundaries of the Belgic Kingdom. It pa&s;&s;es 2 miles &s;outh of Marlborough, on the northern verge of the great ridge of hills, dividing, north and &s;outh, Wilt&s;hire, till it de&s;cends St. Anne's Hill, on the left of Shepherd's Shore, making &s;everal right angles along the edges of the other hills, then mounts to the &s;ummit of Roundway Hill; on the north &s;ide the Roman road from Marlborough, unites with the Wan&s;dike. Hence the Dike pa&s;&s;es through Spy Park to the &s;hire &s;tones, at the divi&s;ion between Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, Wilt&s;hire, and Somer&s;et-&s;hire.</P>
<P>The Down continues.<MILESTONE N="85"></P>
<P>Bi&s;hop Cannings on the left; Bagdon Hill on <MILESTONE N="86"> the right; and beyond it, Roundway Hill and Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>Roundway Hill is famous for a battle fought here, July 13, 1648, between the King's army, and that of the Parliament, under Sir Wm. Waller. Sir William &s;ummoned it to &s;urrender on certain con|ditions, which the be&s;ieged took advantage of, when the King's army was victorious, killed 600, and took 900 pri&s;oners.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="37"><MILESTONE N="87, 88."> The road now de&s;cends.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="89"> Devizes, an ancient town, 89 miles from Lon|don, and 19 from Bath, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Romans; a &s;trong ca&s;tle &s;tood on high ground, &s;outh-we&s;t of the town, but no re|mains of it are &s;tanding. The Keep, or Dungeon, &s;tood on a hill ca&s;t up by hand, which now may be &s;een in a garden, behind the chief inn, in the market-place.</P>
<P>The town has two churches; was chartered by Charles I. &s;ends two members to Parliament, and is governed by a Mayor, Recorder, eleven Aldermen, and 36 Common Council: its manufactories are ker&s;eymere, druggets, and other woollen cloths.</P>
<P>About half a mile from the town, is New Park, the &s;eat of James Sutton, E&s;q. at the foot of Round|way Down, an elegant &s;tone man&s;ion, built by James Wyatt.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="90, 91."> On de&s;cending a hill, not far from Devizes, we have exten&s;ive views over a rich country, bounded by the Somer&s;et and Glouce&s;ter&s;hire hills.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="92"> Before we reach Seend, the road divides; one branch goes through Seend, the other along the low ground, towards Melk&s;ham; but unite again, a little beyond the 96 mile-&s;tone.</P>
<P>Near the village of Seend, 3 miles &s;outh of the Bath road, is Stoke Park, the &s;eat of the late Peter Delme, E&s;q. now of Jo&s;hua Smith, E&s;q. member for Devizes. Mr. Smith has pulled the old hou&s;e down,
<PB N="37" REF="38">and built a new one, on a more elevated &s;ituation, and of Grecian architecture: its &s;tructure, from ea&s;t to we&s;t, is 355 feet in front; it is ju&s;t fini&s;hed, and unites convenience and elegance.</P>

<P>Ju&s;t beyond this &s;tone, on the left, is Shaw Hou&s;e, <MILESTONE N="97"> the &s;eat of Mr. Arnold.</P>
<P>Shaw Hill; hence the road pa&s;&s;es over Atford <MILESTONE N="98, 99."> Common to Atford, a village, but a principal &s;tage on this road. Here we pa&s;s a turnpike. Before we reach the 98 mile &s;tone, the road on the left leads to Cor&s;ham.</P>
<P>Wormwood.<MILESTONE N="100"></P>
<P>Near this &s;tone, a road cro&s;&s;es the turnpike; that <MILESTONE N="101"> on the left goes to Bradford; that on the right to Cor&s;ham.</P>
<P>Cutts Corner.</P>
<P>Here we begin to a&s;cend King&s;down Hill, from <MILESTONE N="102"> the top of which are exten&s;ive pro&s;pect. On the

<P><MILESTONE N="103"> Half a mile beyond the 103d &s;tone, we enter So|mer&s;et&s;hire, and de&s;cend to Bathford, where the two roads meet. Farley Hou&s;e on the left, the &s;eat of Lord Webb Seymour.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="107"> We have now reached Bath, 107 miles from London, through Chippenham; 108 thro' Devizes.</P>
<P>Bath is a very ancient city of Somer&s;et&s;hire; its hot &s;prings are &s;aid to have been di&s;covered 863 years before Chri&s;t, by Bladud, from Brute. It is allowed to have been, formerly, a very exten&s;ive city, and to have been fir&s;t reduced by the Romans, about the year 81.</P>
<P>Bath is &s;eated in a very fertile vale, on the banks of the river Avon, and &s;urrounded by hills, &s;o as to be a very clo&s;e, warm place, particularly in &s;um|mer. From the bowels of the&s;e hills, is dug that beautiful free&s;tone made u&s;e in building the city. Its increa&s;e, within the la&s;t 60 years, has been great and quick; from a &s;mall contracted town, it has extended it&s;elf into open &s;treets and &s;quares, with other elegant buildings in various forms; the whole making a city of con&s;iderable magnitude, &s;o as to a&s;cend almo&s;t to the &s;ummit of the hills about it, and new works are &s;till going on.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="40">The heat of the waters in the different baths, are as follow, according to Farenheit's Thermometer: The water in the King's bath, rai&s;es the mercury in its colde&s;t place to 100 degrees; in its hotte&s;t, to 103 degrees. The hot bath exceeds this by &s;ome degrees; the degrees of heat in the Cro&s;s bath, is 94; and in the Queen's bath, 99.</P>
<P>Ladies and Gentlemen a&s;&s;emble every morning from 7 till 10, to drink the waters.</P>
<P>The amu&s;ements are various, rational, and well-conducted. There are two &s;ets of a&s;&s;embly rooms, where the amu&s;ements are alternately held, and a theatre. Here are two ho&s;pitals, and four churches, including the abbey church. The abbey was founded by O&s;ric, in 676; but the pre&s;ent building was begun in 1495, but not compleated, as it now is, till 1666. It has &s;even doors, and 52 windows, an&s;wering to the weeks in a year, and the days in a week: the tower is 162 feet high, and has a peel of 10 bells. Here are 12 other places of wor&s;hip, and a public grammar &s;chool, endowed by Ed|ward VI.</P>
<P>Bath is governed by a Mayor, Recorder, Alder|men, and 20 Common Council; &s;ends two members to Parliament, and is the &s;ee of a Bi&s;hop, in con|junction with Wells. Here is a court of Record, that takes cognizance of debts above 40<HI>s,</HI> and a Court of Con&s;cience, that determines matters under that &s;um.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="41">It has two markets weekly, Wedne&s;days and Fridays; and well &s;upplied, particularly with fi&s;h.</P>
<P>Bath being &s;urrounded with very high hills, which are unplea&s;ant to climb, very few people like to keep carriages. It is a remarkably clean place, and, lying on &s;uch a declivity, it is &s;oon wa&s;hed clean by a &s;hower of rain, and is &s;oon dry enough to walk upon, without &s;oiling the &s;hoes; and, for the accommodation of going to the rooms dre&s;&s;ed, &s;edan-chairs are always at hand, for 6<HI>d.</HI> or 1<HI>s.</HI></P>
<P>The country round the city, is embelli&s;hed with gentlemens &s;eats; the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed is Prior Park, the &s;eat of the late Ralph Allen.</P>
<P>Lan&s;down over-hangs the city, and is renowned for a battle in the Civil Wars, on July 5, 1643, when the King's forces beat tho&s;e of the Parliament. A monument is erected on it, in commendation of the above-mentioned victory, by George Lord Lan&s;down, in 1720.</P>
<P>The river Avon has been made navigable from Bath to Bri&s;tol, and makes the intercour&s;e between them great. There are two roads to Bri&s;tol; the di&s;tance, 13 miles: one called the Upper Road; and the other, the Lower. The Upper runs from the we&s;t end of the city, along the northern &s;ide of the river, and through a part of Glouce&s;ter&s;hire; the Lower, and the mo&s;t frequented, winds along the &s;outhern bank of the river, from the old bridge;
<PB N="41" REF="42">and a communication between the&s;e two roads, is formed by a hand&s;ome &s;tone bridge, of one arch, over the &s;ame river, about two miles and a half be|low the town.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing then over the bridge, the Lower Road, <MILESTONE N="2"> we &s;oon reach Twiverton, two miles from Bath; and a little beyond the 3d mile-&s;tone, Newton, a &s;mall town, &s;cattered along the &s;ide of a hill; near <MILESTONE N="3"> which, on the &s;outh or left, &s;tands Newton Park, the &s;eat of George Langton, E&s;q.. On the other &s;ide of the river, on a high ridge, &s;tands a hand|&s;ome hou&s;e, the re&s;idence of &s;ome of the family of the late Sir Cae&s;ar Hawkins, who lived occa&s;ion|ally here.</P>
<P>The Vale of Bath, through which the Avon runs, is beautiful in all its parts, and worth the travellers' notice.</P>
<P>Proceeding on from Newton, we leave the village <MILESTONE N="4"> of Cor&s;tan on the left, and pa&s;s through Saltford; on the right of which, on the Avon &s;ide, are &s;everal <MILESTONE N="5, 6."> copper and bra&s;s mills. Hence the road ri&s;es, and we pa&s;s through a rich country towards Keyn&s;ham, eight miles and a half from Bath.<MILESTONE N="7, 8."></P>
<P>Before we reach Keyn&s;ham, we &s;ee a hand&s;ome hou&s;e on the north; this belongs to Edward Lyne, E&s;q.</P>
<P>Keyn&s;ham is a &s;mall market town, &s;tanding on two hills, on the &s;outh bank of the Avon, with a &s;mall bridge over the river Chew, which runs by
<PB N="42" REF="43">it. The counties of Gloce&s;ter and Somer&s;et are joined by a larger bridge over the Avon, below the town.</P>
<P>Keyn&s;ham Church is of Gothic &s;tructure, and the high grounds beyond the town, have a beautiful effect.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing Keyn&s;ham, the hou&s;e on the right is Mr. Butcher's.</P>
<P>At Stanton Drew, a few miles from Keyn&s;ham, are the remains of a Druid Temple, known by the name of <HI>the Wedding,</HI> from a vulgar opinion, that a bride and her attendants were changed into the&s;e &s;tones. This temple, &s;ays Mr. Wood, con&s;i&s;ted of three circles of &s;tones, and formed a model of the Pythagorean Sy&s;tem of the planetary world.</P>
<P>From Keyn&s;ham we de&s;cend into an enclo&s;ed wood-land country, leaving Keyn&s;ham Park on the <MILESTONE N="9"> right; beyond which we ri&s;e another hill, and from the top, about three miles from Bri&s;tol, we have exten|&s;ive pro&s;pects: here we pa&s;s a colliery.</P>
<P>Between the nine and ten mile-&s;tones, the hou&s;e on the right is Mr. Weirs; that on the left Mr. Ire|land's.</P>
<P>From the above-mentioned hill, we de&s;cend to</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10"> Bri&s;lington; and, on our approach to Bri&s;tol, a great number of hand&s;ome hou&s;es and villas, lie &s;cattered on both &s;ides the road.</P>
<P>Beyond Bri&s;lington we go down an avenue of <MILESTONE N="11"> &s;tately trees, pa&s;&s;ing a fine &s;loping valley of rich
<PB N="43" REF="44">verdure, on the left; and a more cultivated country on the right: and again pa&s;&s;ing many hand&s;ome <MILESTONE N="12"> villas, winding round a hill, we get a full view of Bri&s;tol. Beyond this the road ri&s;es to the city.</P>
<P>A little beyond the 12 mile-&s;tone, on the left, is the high road to Wells.</P>
<P>Bri&s;tol is 120 miles from London through Bath, but 6 miles nearer through Chippenham and Mar&s;hfield: it &s;tands part in Somer&s;et&s;hire, and part in Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, the two counties being divided by the river Avon.</P>
<P>This city is a county within it&s;elf, made &s;o by Edward III. and Henry VIII. made it a bi&s;hop's &s;ee. It has 3 hand&s;ome &s;quares, and 18 churches, be&s;ides the cathedral, which &s;tands in Glouce&s;ter|&s;hire. The church of St. Mary Redcliff, is worthy attention, being the mo&s;t beautiful &s;tructure of the kind in the kingdom: its roof is a &s;olid arch of free&s;tone.</P>
<P>Bri&s;tol &s;ends two members to Parliament; and is governed by a Mayor, Recorder, 12 Aldermen, two Sheriffs, and 42 Common Council.</P>
<P>About a mile we&s;t of Bri&s;tol, in Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, is the village of Clifton, &s;eated on the &s;ide of a high hill, extending to the river Avon, the re&s;i|dence of many per&s;ons of fortune. It has a parade, a &s;quare, and other hand&s;ome buildings, fitted up for the accommodation of tho&s;e who re&s;ort here for plea&s;ure, or for health. There are two a&s;&s;embly-rooms,
<PB N="44" REF="45">for the amu&s;ement of the company, on the plan of tho&s;e at Bath.</P>
<P>At the we&s;tern extremity of Clifton, near the lofty rock of St. Vincent's ri&s;es the Bri&s;tol hot|&s;prings; the heat of which, by Fahrenheit's Ther|mometer, is 76 degrees.</P>
<P>THIS De&s;cription of the Road from London to Bath, will &s;erve to conduct the traveller from Bath to London, if he reads it from the end to the be|ginning, and remembers that tho&s;e places which in his way down to Bath were repre&s;ented to be on the right of the road; in his way back, mu&s;t be on the left, and <HI>vic&eacute; ver&s;a.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is a &s;econd road to Bath from London, as I have ob&s;erved, to which I whould give the pre|ference, for many rea&s;ons. In the fir&s;t place, it avoids the hills between Marlborough and Devizes, and, of cour&s;e, &s;aves time upon the journey: &s;e|condly, being le&s;s frequented, is not &s;o du&s;ty in &s;ummer, or &s;o much worn in winter: thirdly, a traveller is not &s;o likely to be &s;topped by a run of po&s;t-chai&s;es, or be obliged to go on with tired hor&s;es: and, la&s;tly, inns are not &s;o expen&s;ive. This road is through Staines, Hart|ford-bridge, Ba&s;ing&s;toke, Andover, Lugger&s;hal,
<PB N="45" REF="46">Everley, and Devizes. To Bath, this way, is one mile more, but the advantages more than com|pen&s;ate it; the country is equally beaut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l. If we travel it in autumn, we pa&s;s throu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h Weyhill Fair, the greate&s;t in the kingdom; and if we would di&s;|pen&s;e with a mile or two more on our journey, and go through Ambre&s;bury, in&s;tead of Everley and Devizes, the road is good, and we pa&s;s clo&s;e by that &s;uperb piece of antiquity, the Druidical Tem|ple of Stonehenge, which every per&s;on of ta&s;te and curio&s;ity goes to &s;ee; and the road this way is not above two or three miles round.</P>
<P>I know the Bath road through Reading, has been admired for the good accommodations met with at the different inns, but all inns are now improved; and there are none that excel <HI>Deme&s;ay's</HI> at Hart|ford-bridge, and &s;ome others on the way: indeed, the accommodations at <HI>Deme&s;ay's</HI> are &s;o excellent, that the Royal Family, &s;en&s;ible of it, make a point always of dining or &s;upping there, in their journey to and from Weymouth.</P>
<P>If the traveller, (let him be of what ca&s;t he will) wi&s;hes to be amu&s;ed on his journey, or at Bath, <HI>Dr. Tru&s;ler</HI> ventures to recommend to his peru&s;al, the two following books; they will afford him a fund of entertainment, being full of laughable anecdote, and make him acquainted with the arts, fine&s;&s;e, and deceptions of the age, in all profe&s;&s;ions
<PB N="46" REF="47">of life. They are a true and very pointed &s;atire on men and manners, and mo&s;t of the characters are now living: though written in the form of Novels, they are good <HI>library books,</HI> and will bear reading again and again.</P>
