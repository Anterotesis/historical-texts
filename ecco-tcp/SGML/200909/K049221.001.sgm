<HEAD>TO HIS GRACE THE Duke of BUCCLEUGH.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is with much plea&s;ure I embrace this opportunity of te&s;tifying my &s;incere re&s;pect for YOUR GRACE's exalted character, as the friend and as the ornament of your coun|try, by addre&s;&s;ing the&s;e volumes to a name &s;o much revered and beloved by the nation
<PB N="viii" REF="5">who&s;e poetry they are intended to pre&s;erve and to illu&s;trate.</P>
<P>The chief compo&s;itions in this volume, MY LORD, will be found to breathe the living &s;pirit of the Scoti&s;h people, a race of men who have left monuments of their martial glory in every country. YOUR GRACE, it is hoped, will with plea&s;ure here recogni&s;e the noble ardour your example lately tended to revive, by rai&s;ing and commanding in per&s;on a military force in defence of your country, at a period when her natives had not di&s;cernment to perceive, nor &s;pirit to a&s;&s;ume, the privileges of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>The &s;econd volume, MY LORD, contains chiefly pieces de&s;criptive of rural merriment, and of love and dome&s;tic happine&s;s. Even the&s;e, it is humbly believed, YOUR GRACE will not di&s;dain; for it is well known that the felicity of the poor in general, and of your numerous tenants and dependants in
<PB N="ix" REF="6">particular, is regarded by YOUR GRACE as e&s;&s;ential to your own. In reward, YOUR GRACE enjoys a dome&s;tic felicity now &s;el|dom or never known to the great who are generally obliged to exchange the free en|joyment of true plea&s;ure for the gaudy &s;la|very of o&s;tentation.</P>
<P>At a period when many of the Briti&s;h nobility are wa&s;ting their patrimonial e&s;tates in profligate di&s;&s;ipation; men trained to arms in defence of their rights and liberties, vil|lages beautified and rendered &s;alubrious, and their inhabitants rendered happy, have been the monuments of expence of the DUKE OF BUCCLEUGH.</P>
<P>The &s;ilent gratitude of the poor will ever &s;peak YOUR GRACE's prai&s;es with an ex|pre&s;&s;ion unknown to the mo&s;t exalted elocu|tion; and it were &s;urely ab&s;urd for any wri|ter to enlarge on what is the common &s;ubject
<PB N="x" REF="7">of conver&s;ation, and known to all; I &s;hall not therefore any longer intrude on YOUR GRACE's patience.</P>
<P>That SCOTLAND may long con&s;ider YOUR GRACE as one of the be&s;t guardians of her liberty, and the living a&s;&s;ertor of her an|cient &s;pirit, is the earne&s;t wi&s;h of,</P>

<HEAD>DISSERTATION I. ON THE ORAL TRADITION OF POETRY.</HEAD>
<P>IT has long been a &s;ubject of regret, that the inven|tors of the fine Arts have by oblivion been deprived of the reputation due to their memory. Of the many realms which lay claim to their birth, Egypt &s;eems to po&s;&s;e&s;s the preference. Yet, like the Nile, which ani|mates that country, while they have diffu&s;ed plea&s;ure and utility over kingdoms, their origin remains hid in the mo&s;t profound ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>That poetry holds a di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;uperiority over all the&s;e &s;ciences is allowed; yet the fir&s;t practi&s;er of this enchanting art has lo&s;t the renown it was de&s;igned to confer. We mu&s;t either allow the conte&s;ted claim of the O&s;iris of the Egyptians, and Apollo of the Greeks, or be content to withhold from any, the fame which indeed &s;eems due to as many inventors as there are di&s;|tinct nations in the world. For poetry appears not to
<PB N="xvi" REF="12">require the labour of di&s;qui&s;ition, or aid of chance, to invent; but is rather the original language of men in an infant &s;tate of &s;ociety in all countries. It is the effu&s;ion of fancy actuated by the pa&s;&s;ions: and that the&s;e are always &s;tronge&s;t when uncontrouled by cu&s;tom, and the manners which in an advanced community are termed polite, is evident. But the peculiar advantages, which a certain &s;ituation of extrin&s;ic objects confers on this art, have already been &s;o well illu&s;trated by emi|nent critics
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Particularly Dr. Blackwell, in his Enquiry into the Life and Writings of Homer; and Dr. Blair, in his elegant Di&s;&s;ertation on the Poems of O&s;&s;ian.</NOTE>, that it is unnece&s;&s;ary here to remember them. I have be&s;ides noted a few &s;uch as immediately concern the compo&s;itions now under view in the &s;ub|&s;equent Di&s;&s;ertation; and only propo&s;e here to give a brief account of the utility of the Oral Tradition of Poetry, in that barbarous &s;tate of &s;ociety which nece&s;|&s;arily precedes the invention of letters; and of the cir|cum&s;tances that con&s;pired to render it ea&s;y and &s;afe.</P>
<P>Among the Egyptians, probably the mo&s;t ancient authors of the elegant, as well as u&s;eful &s;ciences, we find that ver&s;es were originally u&s;ed &s;olely to pre&s;erve the laws of their princes, and &s;ayings of their wi&s;e men from oblivion
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Herodot. Diodor. Sicul. &amp;c.</NOTE>. The&s;e were &s;ometimes in&s;cribed in their temples in their hieroglyphic character, but more
<PB N="xvii" REF="13">frequently only committed to the memory of the ex|pounders of their Law, or di&s;ciples of their &s;ages. Pythagoras, who was initiated in their &s;ecret &s;cience, conveyed in like manner his dictates to his di&s;ciples, as appears from the moral ver&s;es which pa&s;s under his name at this day. And though the authenticity of the&s;e may be que&s;tioned, yet that he followed this mode of bequeathing his knowledge to his followers, is proved from the con&s;ent of all antiquity
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jamblichus de vita Pythag. <HI>pa&s;&s;im;</HI> and particularly <HI>lib.</HI> I. <HI>cap.</HI> 15. and 25.</NOTE>. Nay, before him, Thales compo&s;ed in like manner his Sy&s;tem of Natural Philo&s;ophy. And even &s;o late as the time of Ari&s;totle, the Laws of the Agathyr&s;i, a nation in Sarmatia, were all delivered in ver&s;e. Not to mention the known laws of the Twelve Tables, which, from the fragments &s;till remaining of them, appear to have con&s;i&s;ted of &s;hort rythmic &s;entences.</P>
<P>From laws and religion poetry made an ea&s;y progre&s;s to the celebration of the Gods and Heroes, who were their founders. Ver&s;es in their prai&s;e were &s;ung on &s;olemn occa&s;ions by the compo&s;ers, or bards them&s;elves. We meet with many before Homer, who di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by &s;uch productions. Fabricius
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In Bibliotheca Graeca, <HI>tom.</HI> I.</NOTE> has enu|merated near &s;eventy who&s;e names have reached our times. That immortal author had the advantage of
<PB N="xviii" REF="14">hearing their poems repeated; and was certainly in|debted to his predece&s;&s;ors for many beauties which we admire as original. That he was him&s;elf an &Agr;&Ogr;&Igr;&Dgr;&Ogr;&Sgr;, or Min&s;trel, and &s;ung his own ver&s;es to the lyre, is &s;hown by the admirable author of the Enquiry into his Life and Writings
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sect. VIII.</NOTE>. Nor were his poems re&s;cued from the uncertain fame of tradition, and committed to wri|ting till &s;ome time after his death
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Aelian. Var. Hi&s;t. lib. xiii. c. 14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Such was the utility of the poetic tradition among the more poli&s;hed nations of antiquity: and with tho&s;e they denominated Barbarians we find it no le&s;s practi&s;ed
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The reader, who would de&s;ire more intelligence on this head, may con&s;ult a curious <HI>Di&s;&s;ertation on the Monuments which &s;upplied the Defect of Writing among the fir&s;t Hi&s;torians,</HI> by the Abb&eacute; An&s;e&s;m, in Les Memoires de l'Academie des In&s;criptions, &amp;c.</NOTE>. The Per&s;ians had their Magi, who pre&s;erved, as would &s;eem in this way, the remarkable events of former times, and in war went before the army &s;inging the prai&s;es of their illu&s;trious men, whom the extraordinary gratitude and admiration of their countrymen had exalted into Deities. If they gained the victory, the Song of Triumph recorded the deeds of tho&s;e who had fallen, and by their prai&s;es animated the ambition of tho&s;e who enjoyed the conque&s;t to farther acts of valour. The latter cu&s;tom
<PB N="xix" REF="15">was in u&s;e &s;till more anciently among the Jews, as appears from the &s;ongs of Mo&s;es
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exod XV.</NOTE> and Deborah

<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Macpher&s;on, in his Di&s;&s;ertation on the Era of O&s;&s;ian, p. 228. ed. 1773.</NOTE> acquaints us, <Q>Every chief in proce&s;s of time had a bard in his family, and the office be|came hereditary. By the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the&s;e bards the poems concerning the ance&s;tors of the family were handed down from generation to generation; they were repeated to the whole clan on &s;olemn occa|&s;ions, and always alluded to in the new compo&s;i|tions of the bards.</Q> The &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of O&s;&s;ian were at length employed chiefly in the mean office of pre&s;erving fabulous genealogies, and flattering the pride of their chieftains at the expence of truth, without
<PB N="xxiii" REF="19">even fancy &s;ufficient to render their inventions either plea&s;ing or plau&s;ible. That order of men, I believe, is now altogether extinct; yet they have left a &s;pirit of poetry in the country where they flouri&s;hed
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Martin's, and other De&s;criptions of the We&s;tern I&s;les, pa&s;&s;im.</NOTE>; and O&s;&s;ian's harp &s;till yields a dying &s;ound among the wilds of Morven.</P>
<P>Having thus given a faint view of the progre&s;s of the Oral Tradition of Poetry to the&s;e times
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">For an account of the more modern min&s;trels &s;ee Dr. Percy's Di&s;&s;ertation, which is &s;o complete that it leaves nothing to add:</NOTE>, I proceed to &s;hew what arts the ancient bards employed to make their ver&s;es take &s;uch hold of the memory of their countrymen, as to be tran&s;mitted &s;afe and entire without the aid of writing for many ages. The&s;e may be con&s;idered as affecting the pa&s;&s;ions and the ear. Their mode of expre&s;&s;ion was &s;imple and genuine. They of con&s;equence touched the pa&s;&s;ions truly and effectively. And when the pa&s;&s;ions are engaged, we li&s;ten with avidity to the tale that &s;o agreeably affects them; and remember it again with the mo&s;t prompt facility. This may be ob&s;erved in children, who will forget no circum&s;tance of an intere&s;ting &s;tory, more e&s;pecially if &s;triking or dreadful to the fancy; when they cannot remember a &s;hort maxim which only oc|cupies the judgement. The pa&s;&s;ions of men have been and will be the &s;ame through all ages. Poetry is the &s;overeign of the pa&s;&s;ions, and will reign while they
<PB N="xxiv" REF="20">exi&s;t. We may laugh at Sir I&s;aac Newton, as we have at De&s;cartes; but we &s;hall always admire a Homer, an O&s;&s;ian, or a Shak&s;pere.</P>
<P>As the &s;ubjects of the&s;e genuine painters of nature deeply intere&s;ted the heart, and by that means were &s;o agreeable and affecting, that every hearer wi&s;hed to remember them; &s;o their mode of con&s;tructing their ver&s;e was &s;uch, that the remembrance was ea&s;y and expeditious. A few of their many arts to aid the me|mory I &s;hall here enumerate.</P>
<P N="1">I. Mo&s;t of the&s;e Oral poems were &s;et to mu&s;ic, as would appear, by the original authors them&s;elves. That this was the cu&s;tom &s;o early as the days of Homer, may be &s;een in the excellent author formerly adduced
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Enquiry, &amp;c. Sect. VIII.</NOTE>. How &s;hould we have been affected by hearing a compo&s;ition of Homer or O&s;&s;ian <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ung and played by the&s;e immortal ma&s;ters them&s;elves! With the poem the air &s;eems to have pa&s;&s;ed from one age to another; but as no mu&s;ical compo&s;itions of the Greeks exi&s;t, we are quite in the dark as to the nature of the&s;e. I &s;uppo&s;e that O&s;&s;ian's poetry is &s;till recited to its ori|ginal cadence and to appropriated tunes. We find, in an excellent modern writer
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Warton, in his Hi&s;tory of Engli&s;h Poetry.</NOTE>, that this mode of &s;inging poetry to the harp was reckoned an accompli&s;hment &s;o late as among the Saxon Eccle&s;ia&s;tics. The ancient

As for in&s;tance, the delivery of me&s;&s;ages, the de&s;cription of battles, &amp;c. of which we meet with infinite examples in Homer, and &s;ome, if I mi&s;take not, in O&s;&s;ian. Good ones may be found in Hardyknute, Part I. v. 123, &amp;c. compared with part II. v. 107, &amp;c. and in Child Maurice, v. 31, with v. 67; and innumerable &s;uch in the ancient Traditional Poetry of all nations. The&s;e &s;erved as land marks, in the view of which the memory travelled &s;ecure over the intervening &s;paces. On this head falls likewi&s;e to be mentioned what we call The Burden, that is, the unvaried repetition of one or more lines fixing the tone of the poem throughout the whole. That this is very ancient among the barbaric nations, may be gathered from the known Song of Regner

<P N="2">2. Alliteration was before the invention of rime greatly u&s;ed, chiefly by the nations of Northern origi|nal, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the remembrance of their traditional poe|try. Mo&s;t of the Runic methods of ver&s;ification con|&s;i&s;ted in this practice. It was the only one among the Saxon poets, from whom it pa&s;&s;ed to the Engli&s;h and Scoti&s;h

This poem was written about 1350. There is a remarkable &s;imilarity in its &s;tyle and manner with tho&s;e very curious pieces of ancient Scoti&s;h poetry, &s;tyled The Prophecies of Thomas Rymer, Marvellous Merling, Beid, Berlington, Waldhave, Eltraine, Ba|ni&s;ter, and Sybilla, printed at Edinburgh in 1615, and reprinted from that edition, 1742, 8vo.

His rea&s;ons are only founded on the modern appearance of &s;ome particular pa&s;&s;ages. That they have been modernized and corrupted, I will readily allow; but that they are on the main nearly as ancient as Rymer's time, who died about the beginning of the 14th Century, I believe the learned mu&s;t confe&s;s from intrin&s;ic evidence, in &s;uch ca&s;es the &s;ure&s;t of all. Not to mention that Sir David Lind&s;ay, who wrote in the reign of James V. is an undoubted witne&s;s that they mu&s;t be more ancient than this eminent Antiquary would infer. For in enumerating the methods he took to divert that prince while under his care in his infancy, after conde&s;cending on &s;ome ri&s;ible cir|cum&s;tances, as

<P N="3"><PB N="xxxi" REF="27">III. But the greate&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance that could be found to the tradition of poetry was derived from the invention of rime; which is far more ancient than is commonly believed. One of the mo&s;t learned men this age has produced

And though the &s;pirit of the Greek and Latin languages did not always admit of them in poetry, yet they were u&s;ed as occa&s;ional beauties by their mo&s;t celebrated writers. Homer, He&s;iod, and Virgil, have a few, though ap|parently more from chance than de&s;ign. The ancient Saturnine ver&s;es were all rimes, as an old commentator
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Servius ad Georg. II. ver. 386.</NOTE> informs us. And it is more than probable they were &s;o con&s;tructed merely that the memory might the more ea&s;ily pre&s;erve them, their licence forbidding their being committed to writing.

The Spani&s;h romanzes bear a great re&s;emblance in this, as in other re&s;pects, to the Scoti&s;h Ballads. In both, every alternate line ends with &s;imilar vowels, though the con&s;onants are not &s;o &s;trictly at|tended to. As for in&s;tance, in the former we have <HI>bana, e&s;pada; mala, palabra; vega, cueva; rompan, vol|canos;</HI> for rimes: and in the later, <HI>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dale, girdle; keep, bleed; Buleighan, tak him;</HI> &amp;c.

<P>As the &s;implicity of this &s;tanza rendered it ea&s;y to the compo&s;er, and likewi&s;e more natural to expre&s;s the pa&s;&s;ions, &s;o it added to the facility of recollection. It's tone is &s;edate and &s;low. The rimes occur &s;eldom, and at equal di&s;tances: though when a more violent pa&s;&s;ion is to be painted, by doubling the rimes, they at once expre&s;&s;ed the mind better, and diver&s;ified the harmony. Of this the reader will ob&s;erve many in&s;tances in this collection, as, <HI>Here maun I lie, here maun I die: Like beacon bricht at deid of nicht: Na river heir, my dame, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> deir:</HI> &amp;c. and, to give a very &s;olemn movement to the cadence, they &s;ometimes tripled the rime, an in&s;tance of which may be ob&s;erved in the fir&s;t &s;tanza of Child Maurice.</P>
<P>When all the circum&s;tances here hinted at are con&s;i|dered, we &s;hall be le&s;s apt to wonder, that, by the concurrence of mu&s;ical air, retentive arts in the com|po&s;ition, and chiefly of rime, the mo&s;t noble produc|tions of former periods have been pre&s;erved in the me|mory of a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of admirers, and have had the good fortune to arrive at our times pure and uncor|rupted.</P>

<HEAD>DISSERTATION II. ON THE TRAGIC BALLAD.</HEAD>
<P>THAT &s;pecies of poetry which we denominate Ballad, is peculiar to a barbarous period. In an advanced &s;tate of arts, the Comic Ballad a&s;&s;umes the form of the Song or Sonnet, and the Tragic or Heroic Ballad that of the higher Ode.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e of our plea&s;ure in &s;eeing a mournful event repre&s;ented, or hearing it de&s;cribed, has been attempted to be explained by many critics
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ari&s;totle, Scaliger, Dubos, Trapp in his Praelections, Hume, E&s;&s;ay on Tragedy; but, above all, Mr. Burke in his Enquiry into the Sublime and Beautiful.</NOTE>. It &s;eems to ari&s;e from the mingled pa&s;&s;ions of Admiration of the art of the author, Curio&s;ity to attend the termination, De|light ari&s;ing from a reflection on our own &s;ecurity, and the Sympathetic Spirit.</P>
<P><PB N="xxxv" REF="31">In giving this plea&s;ure, perhaps the Tragic Ballad yields to no effort of human genius. When we peru&s;e a poli&s;hed Tragedy or Ode, we admire the art of the author, and are led to prai&s;e the invention; but when we read an unartful de&s;cription of a melancholy event, our pa&s;&s;ions are more inten&s;ely moved. The laboured productions of the informed compo&s;er re&s;emble a Greek or Roman temple; when we enter it, we admire the art of the builder. The rude effu&s;ions of the Gothic Mu&s;e are like the monuments of their Architecture. We are filled with a religious reverence, and, forgetting our prai&s;e of the contriver, adore the pre&s;ent deity.</P>
<P>I believe no Tragic Ballad of renowned Antiquity has reached our times, if we deny the beautiful and pathetic CARMEN DE ATY in Catullus a title to this cla&s;s; which, as a modern critic of note has ob&s;erved
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ay on the writings and genius of Pope, <HI>p.</HI> 324. 3d <HI>ed.</HI></NOTE>, &s;eems a tran&s;lation from &s;ome Greek <HI>Dithyrambic</HI>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Dithyrambics</HI> were Heroic Songs, written with the highe&s;t glow of poetic fancy in honour of the ancient deities. Ari&s;totle informs us, that the Greek Tragedy originated from them; as their Comedy did from their Pa&s;toral Love Songs.</NOTE>, far more ancient than the times of that poet. His tran&s;lation of Sappho's Ode might &s;hew that he took a delight in the ancient Greek compo&s;itions, from which indeed he &s;eems to have derived in a great mea&s;ure his peculiarly delicate vein.</P>
<P><PB N="xxxvi" REF="32">But it was with the nations in a &s;tate of barbarity that this effu&s;ion of the heart flouri&s;hed as in it's pro|per &s;oil; their &s;ocieties, rude and irregular, were full of vici&s;&s;itudes, and every hour &s;ubject to the mo&s;t dreadful accidents. The Mini&s;trels, who only knew, and were in&s;pired by the pre&s;ent manners, caught the tale of mortality, and recorded it for the in&s;truction and en|tertainment of others. It plea&s;ed by moving the pa&s;|&s;ions, and, at the &s;ame time, afforded caution to their auditors to guard again&s;t &s;imilar mi&s;-adventures.</P>
<P>It is amu&s;ing to ob&s;erve how expre&s;&s;ive the poetry of every country is of its real manners. That of the Northern nations is ferocious to the highe&s;t degree. Nor need we wonder that tho&s;e, who&s;e laws obliged them to decide the mo&s;t trifling debate with the &s;word

The ballad poetry of the Spaniards is tinged with the romantic gallantry of the nation. The hero is all complai&s;ance; and takes off his helmet in the heat of combat, when he thinks on his mi&s;tre&s;s. That of the Engli&s;h is generous and brave. In their mo&s;t noble ballad, Percy laments over the death of his
<PB N="xxxvii" REF="33">mortal foe. That of the Scots is perhaps, like the face of their country, more various than the re&s;t. We find in it the bravery of the Engli&s;h, the gallantry of the Spani&s;h, and I am afraid in &s;ome in&s;tances the ferocity of the Northern.</P>

<L>I trembled fa&s;t, my fear grew more and more.</L>

<L>With many vows never to tire again.</L></Q>
<P>And the whole concludes with an exhortation to a pious life.</P>
<P>But what has the Chri&s;tian religion to do with poetry? In the true poetic terrible, I believe, &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in Hardyknute yield to no attempt of a &s;trong and dark fancy. The Ballad &s;tyled Edward may, I fear, be ra|ther adduced as an evidence that this di&s;plea&s;es, when it ri&s;es to a degree of the horrible, which that &s;ingular piece certainly partakes of.</P>
<P>The Pathetic is the other principal walk of the Tragic Mu&s;e: and in this the Scoti&s;h Ballads yield to no compo&s;itions whatever. What can be imagined more moving than the cata&s;trophes of O&s;&s;ian's Dar|thula, the mo&s;t pathetic of all poems? or of Hardyk|nute,
<PB N="xli" REF="37">Child Maurice, and indeed mo&s;t of the pieces now collected? Were ever the feelings of a fond mother expre&s;&s;ed in a language equal in &s;implicity and pathos to that of lady Bothwell?&mdash;This leads me to remark, that the dialect in which the Scoti&s;h Ballads are written gives them a great advantage in point of touching the pa&s;&s;ions. Their language is rough and unpoli&s;hed, and &s;eems to flow immediately from the heart

<P>Mo&s;t of the compo&s;itions now offered to the public, have already received approbation. The mutilated Fragment of Hardyknute formerly in print, was ad|mired and celebrated by the be&s;t critics. As it is now, I am inclined to think, given in it's original perfection, it is certainly the mo&s;t noble production in this &s;tyle that ever appeared in the world. The manners and characters are &s;trongly marked, and well pre&s;erved; the incidents deeply intere&s;ting; and the cata&s;trophe new and affecting.

<P>HAVING in the Fir&s;t of the foregoing Di&s;&s;ertations mentioned with applau&s;e the Spani&s;h Ballads, or Romanzes, contained in the HISTORIA DE LAS GUERRAS CIVILES DE GRANADA, and that book being &s;eldom to be met with, and written in a language of no wide &s;tudy, the Editor has been induced to give a few tran&s;lations from that work; the two which Dr. Percy has publi&s;hed having rather excited than gra|tified curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>Before producing the&s;e tran&s;lations, it may be pro|per to give &s;ome &s;hort account of the work whence they are taken. The Hi&s;tory of the Civil Wars of Granada is a well-written narration of tho&s;e di&s;&s;entions which tore that kingdom in pieces, for &s;ome years be|fore the period that Ferdinand and I&s;abella, king and queen of Chri&s;tian Spain, conquered it, down to the time of conque&s;t. The chief &s;ources of tho&s;e di&s;&s;en|tions were the two great <HI>Vandos,</HI> or factions, of the Zegris and the Abencerrages; who&s;e exploits and ad|ventures, with tho&s;e of their adherents, are here di&s;|played with a minute detail that &s;avours very &s;trongly of romance, though the great outlines of the work are evidently founded on hi&s;torical truth; which, if the
<PB N="xlvi" REF="41">reader plea&s;es, is indeed only another name for a cer|tain &s;pecies of romance.</P>
<P>This Hi&s;tory, as we learn from the work it&s;elf to|wards the clo&s;e, is a tran&s;lation from the Arabic of an anonymous Moor, who fled to Africa with many of his countrymen, when Granada was yielded to the arms of Ferdinand. His grand&s;on, by name Argutaafa, found this work among his grandfather's papers, and pre&s;ented it to a Jew, called Rabbi Santo, who tran&s;lated it into He|brew; and gave the Arabic Original to Don Rodrigo Ponce de Leon, Conde de Baylen. That lord being intere&s;ted by it, as his ance&s;tors had been concerned in the wars there related, ordered the Jew to tran&s;late it into Ca&s;tillan Spani&s;h; and afterwards gave the tran&s;lation to the Spani&s;h editor, who&s;e name from the fir&s;t edition, Barcelona printed by Seb. Matevad, 1610, appears to be Ginez Perez.</P>
<P>On almo&s;t every occa&s;ion the author produces &s;ome romanze, as the voucher of his incidents, tran&s;lations of a few of which &s;hall now be produced. It mu&s;t, however, be premi&s;ed, that the fir&s;t tran&s;lation is merely meant to convey to the reader an idea of the ver&s;e in which mo&s;t of the originals are written; for which purpo&s;e one of the feeble&s;t was cho&s;en, as, had &s;trength of thought or incident been attempted in this way, the &s;pirit would have totally evaporated in the mid&s;t of attention to the double rimes, of which the Engli&s;h language is remarkably penurious.</P>

<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<P>HARDYKNUTE.] This name is of <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> extract, and &s;ignifies <HI>Canute the &s;trong. Hardy</HI> in the original implies <HI>&s;trong,</HI> not <HI>valiant;</HI> and though u&s;ed in the latter &s;en&s;e by the Engli&s;h, yet the Scots &s;till take it in its fir&s;t acceptation. <Q>The names in Cunningham,</Q> &s;ays Sir David Dalrymple, <Q>are all Saxon, as is the name of the country it&s;elf.</Q> An|nals of Scotland, <HI>an.</HI> 1160, <HI>note.</HI> The <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> and <HI>Saxon</HI> are both derived from the old <HI>Gothic,</HI> and were &s;o &s;imilar, that a per&s;on of the one nation might under&s;tand one of the other &s;peaking in his proper tongue. From the names and whole tenor of
<PB N="116" REF="179">this poem, I am inclined to think the chief &s;cene is laid in Cunningham&s;hire; where likewi&s;e the <HI>battle of Largs,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed to be that &s;o nobly de&s;cribed in the fir&s;t part, was fought.</P>
<P>Ver. 5. <HI>Britons.</HI>] This was the common name which the Scots gave the Engli&s;h anciently, as may be ob&s;erved in their old poets; and particularly <HI>Blind Harry,</HI> who&s;e te&s;timony indeed can only be relied on, as to the common language and manners of his time; his Life of Wallace being a ti&s;&s;ue of the mo&s;t ab&s;urd fa|bles ever mingled.</P>
<P>V. 9. <HI>Hie on a bill,</HI> &amp;c.] This nece&s;&s;ary caution in tho&s;e times, when &s;trength was the only protection from violence, is well painted by a contemporary French bard:
<Q><L>Un cha&s;teau &s;cay &s;ur roche e&s;pouvantable,</L>
<L>En lieu venteux, la rive perilleu&s;e,</L>
<L>La vy tyrant &s;eant &agrave; haute table,</L>
<L>En grand palais, en &s;al plantureu&s;e, &amp;c.</L>
<BIBL><HI>D' Alliac, Eveque de Cambray.</HI></BIBL></Q></P>
<P>V. 12. <HI>Knicht.</HI>] The&s;e knights were only military officers attending the earls, barons, &amp;c. as appears from the hi&s;tories of the middle ages. See Selden, <HI>Tit. Hon. P.</HI> II. <HI>c.</HI> 5. The name is of Saxon origin, and of remote antiquity, as is proved by the following fragment of a poem on the Spani&s;h expedition of Charles the Great, written at that period:
<PB N="117" REF="180">

<P>The oath which the ancient knights of Scotland gave at their inve&s;titure is pre&s;erved in a letter of Drummond of Hawthornden to Ben Jon&s;on, and is as follows:</P>
<Q><P><HI>I &s;hall fortifie and defend the true holy Catholique and Chri&s;tian Religion, pre&s;ently profe&s;&s;ed, at all my power.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I &s;hall be loyal and true to my Sovereign Lord the King his Maje&s;ty; and do honour and reverence to all orders of che|valrie, and to the uoble office of arms.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I &s;hall fortifie and defend ju&s;tice to the uttermo&s;t of my power, but feid or favour.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I &s;hall never flie from the King's Maje&s;ty my Lord and Ma&s;ter, or his lieutenant, in time of battel or medly with di&s;honour.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="181"><HI>I &s;hall defend my native country from all aliens and &s;trangers at all my power.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I &s;hall maintain and defend the hone&s;t adoes and quarrels of all ladies of honour, widows, orphans, and maids of good fame.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I &s;hall do diligence, wherever I hear tell there are any traitors, murtherers, rievers, and ma&s;terful theeves and out|laws, that &s;uppre&s;s the poor, to bring them to the law at all my power.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I &s;hall maintain aed defend the noble and gallant &s;tate of chevalrie with hor&s;es, harne&s;es, and other knichtly apparel to my power.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I &s;hall be diligent to enquire, and &s;eek to have the know|ledge of all points and articles, touching or concerning my duty, contained in the book of chevalry.</HI></P>
<P><HI>All and &s;undry the premi&s;es I oblige me to keep and fulfill. So help me God by my own hand, and by God him&s;elf.</HI></P></Q>
<P>A curious account of the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of knight|hood, and its influence on &s;ociety, may be found in a learned and ingenious work lately publi&s;hed by Dr. Stuart, intitled, <HI>A view of Society in Europe, or Enquiries concerning the Hi&s;tory of Law, Government, and Manners.</HI></P>
<P>V. 16. <HI>Emergard.</HI>] In the common copies it is Elenor, and indeed in all the recitals I have heard; but in a late edition publi&s;hed with other Scoti&s;h &s;ongs at Edinburgh, 1776, it is rightly read as here. <HI>Emergard,</HI> or <HI>Ermengarde,</HI> was daughter of the Vi&s;count of Beau|mont,
<PB N="119" REF="182">and wife of William the Lyon. She died in 1233 As the name was uncommon, and of difficult pronun|ciation, the rehear&s;ers &s;eem to have altered it to <HI>Elenor,</HI> which has none of the&s;e defects.</P>
<P>The battle of Largs, &s;uppo&s;ed to be that meant in this poem, was fought on the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t 1263, &s;o that queen Emergard was dead thirty years before; yet this can amount to no error in chronology, as the ver&s;es evidently imply that the lady of Hardyknute <HI>had</HI> no equal in the kingdom for beauty &s;ave the queen in the prime of the youth and beauty of both, which might well be forty years, or more, before the period of action in the poem.</P>
<P>V. 25. <HI>Fairly.</HI>] This name &s;eems likewi&s;e of Saxon origin. There is a &s;mall i&s;land and a rivulet in Cun|ningham &s;till called <HI>Fairly i&s;le</HI> and <HI>Fairly Burn.</HI></P>
<P>V. 43. <HI>Twenty thou&s;and glittering &s;peirs,</HI> &amp;c.] This agrees with Buchanan's account, <HI>Acho&mdash;viginti millia militum expo&s;uit.</HI> lib. 7. Torfaeus a&s;&s;erts this number of the Norwegians was left dead on the field; but upon what authority I know not, as the ancient relations of the battle of Largs &s;upport not his te&s;timony. See <HI>John&s;tone's Tran&s;lation of Haco's Expedition to Scotland in the year</HI> 1263, <HI>from the Plateyan and Fri&s;ian MSS.</HI> printed at Copenhagen 1782.</P>
<P>V. 49. <HI>Page</HI>] The Pages in the periods of chi|valry were of honourable account. The young war|riers
<PB N="120" REF="183">were fir&s;t denominated <HI>pages,</HI> then <HI>valets,</HI> or <HI>damei|&s;eaux,</HI> from which degree they reached that of <HI>ecuyer,</HI> or <HI>&s;quire,</HI> and from this that of <HI>knight.</HI> See <HI>Du Cange,</HI> voc. <HI>Valeti,</HI> &amp; <HI>Domicellus. St. Palaye,</HI> Mem. &s;ur l'anc. Cheval. <HI>P.</HI> I.</P>
<P>V. 61. <HI>He has tane a horn;</HI> &amp;c.] The <HI>horn,</HI> or <HI>bugil,</HI> was anciently u&s;ed by the Scots in&s;tead of the trumpet. They were &s;ometimes richly ornamented, as appears from Lind&s;ay's de&s;cription of that of Sir Robert Coch|ran. <Q>The horn he wore was adorned with jewels and precious &s;tones, and tipped with fine gold at both ends. <BIBL><HI>Hi&s;t. of Scotland,</HI> J. III.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>V. 88. We&s;tmoreland's <HI>ferce heir.</HI>] <HI>Heir,</HI> in the old Scoti&s;h acceptation, &s;eems derived from the Latin <HI>he|rus,</HI> and &s;ignifies not <HI>apparent &s;ucce&s;&s;or,</HI> but <HI>pre&s;ent lord.</HI> As in the following lines of <HI>Blind Harry:</HI>
<Q><L>Of Southampton he hecht baith heir and lord.</L>
<BIBL>B. 7. c. 1.</BIBL></Q>
<Q><L>Of Gloce&s;ter the huge lord and heir.</L>
<BIBL>B. 12. c. 1.</BIBL></Q> And in this of <HI>Dunbar,</HI>
<Q>Befoir <HI>Mahoun</HI> the heir of hell.</Q></P>
<P>V. 107&mdash;112.] This minute de&s;cription might lead us to &s;u&s;pect, that a female hand had &s;ome part in this compo&s;ition. But, before our min&s;trel, Homer has &s;hewn
<PB N="121" REF="184">him&s;elf an adept in the lady's dre&s;s. To the curious remarks on the variation of the Briti&s;h habit, given us by Mr. Walpole, in his <HI>Anecdotes of Painting,</HI> and Mr. Granger, in his <HI>Biographical Hi&s;tory,</HI> might be added the follow|ing notice from a reverend mini&s;ter of the church of Scotland. <Q>About 1698 the women got a cu&s;tome of wearing few garments: I my&s;elfe have &s;een the young bri&s;k ladies walking on the &s;treets with ma&s;ks on their faces, and with one onlie thin petticoat and their &s;moak; &s;o thin that one would make a con&s;cience of &s;weiring they were not naked.</Q> <HI>Mi&s;cellanies, by Mr. John Bell, mini&s;ter at Glad&s;muir,</HI> MS. pen. Edit. <HI>title</HI> Apparel.</P>
<P>V. 112. <HI>Save that of Fairly fair.</HI>] Working at the needle, &amp;c. was reckoned an honourable employment by the greate&s;t ladies of tho&s;e times. Margaret, the queen of Malcolm III. as we learn from her life written by <HI>Turgot</HI> her confe&s;&s;or, employed the lei&s;ure hours of her ladies in this manner. See Lord Hales' <HI>Annals of Scotland,</HI> an. 1093.</P>
<P>V. 121. <HI>Sir Knicht.</HI>] <Q>The addition <HI>Sir</HI> to the names of knights was in u&s;e before the age of Ed|ward I. and is from <HI>Sire,</HI> which in old French &s;ignifies <HI>Seignieur</HI> or Lord. Though applicable to all knights it &s;erved properly to di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e of the order who were not barons. <BIBL>Dr. Stuart, <HI>View of Society,</HI> &amp;c. Notes <HI>on</HI> &s;ect. 4. chap. ii. p. 269.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="185">V. 123&mdash;128. The cu&s;tom of the ladies tending the wounded knights was common in tho&s;e romantic ages. <HI>Lydgate,</HI> who&s;e &s;tory is ancient, but who&s;e man|ners are tho&s;e of his own times, has an in&s;tance in <HI>The Story of Thebes,</HI> part ii. Speaking of the daughter of Ly|curgus and Tideus;
<Q><L>To a chamber &s;he led him up aloft.</L>
<L>Full well be&s;eine, there in a bed right &s;oft,</L>
<L>Richly abouten apparrailed</L>
<L>With clothe of gold, all the floure irailed</L>
<L>Of the &s;ame both in length and brede:</L>
<L>And fir&s;t this lady, of her womanhede,</L>
<L>Her women did bid, as goodly as they can,</L>
<L>To be attendant unto this wounded man:</L>
<L>And when he was unarmed to his &s;hert,</L>
<L>She made fir&s;t wa&s;h his woundis &s;mert,</L>
<L>And &s;erch hem well with divers in&s;truments,</L>
<L>And made fet &s;undrie ointments, &amp;c.</L></Q> And in an excellent piece of old Engli&s;h poetry, &s;tyled Sir Cauline, publi&s;hed by Dr. Percy in the fir&s;t volume of his <HI>Reliques,</HI> when the king is informed that knight is &s;ick, he &s;ays,
<Q><L>Fetche me down my daughter deere,</L>
<L>She is a leeche fulle fine.</L>
<BIBL>v. 29, 30.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="186">V. 145&mdash;152.] This &s;tanza is now fir&s;t printed. It is &s;urpri&s;ing it's omi&s;&s;ion was not marked in the frag|ment formerly publi&s;hed, as without it the circum|&s;tance of the knight's complaint is altogether foreign and vague. The lo&s;s was attempted to be glo&s;&s;ed over by many variations of the preceding four lines, but the defect was palpable to the mo&s;t inattentive peru&s;er.</P>
<P>V. 154. <HI>Lord Chattan.</HI>] This is a very ancient and honourable Scotti&s;h &s;urname. Some genealogi&s;ts derive them from the <HI>Chatti,</HI> an ancient German tribe; but others, with more probability, from the <HI>Gilchattan</HI> of Ireland. St. <HI>Chattan</HI> was one of the fir&s;t Scoti&s;h confe&s;&s;ors, to whom was dedicated the priory of <HI>Ard|chattan</HI> in Lorn, founded in 1230, and &s;ome others through the kingdom. The chief of the clan <HI>Chattan</HI> dying in the reign of David I. without male i&s;&s;ue, the clan a&s;&s;umed the ance&s;tor of the <HI>M'Pher&s;ons</HI> for &s;u|perior, by which means the name appears to have been lo&s;t in that of <HI>M'Pher&s;on.</HI> See <HI>Buchanan's Brief Enquiry into the Genealogy and Pre&s;ent State of Ancient Scotti&s;h Surnames.</HI> Gla&s;gow, 1723, 4 to, <HI>p.</HI> 67.</P>
<P>We however find the Clan Chattan mentioned as late as 1590 in <HI>The Hi&s;tory of the Feuds and Conflicts of the Clans, publi&s;hed from a MS. of the reign of James VI.</HI> Gla&s;gow, 1764; where a Macinto&s;h is called their chief.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="187">V. 159.] Though we learn from <HI>Buchanan's Equiry,</HI> &amp;c. that the clan <HI>Chattan</HI> are &s;aid to have come into Scotland long before the expul&s;ion of the Picts, yet I do not find this pretty anecdote, which is much in the &s;pirit of Homer, has any foundation in hi&s;tory. The empire of the Picts was demoli&s;hed by Kenneth about four centuries before the apparent date of the events narrated in this poem.</P>
<P>V. 169. <HI>Mak ori&s;ons,</HI> &amp;c.] This is perfectly in the &s;tyle of knighthood. Before they entered into com|bat they &s;olemly invoked the aid of God, their Saviour, or their mi&s;tre&s;s: religion and gallantry being the prime motives of all their adventures. <HI>Les premieres le&ccedil;ons qu'on leur donnoit regardoient principalement l'amour de Dieu et des dames, c'e&s;t &agrave; dire la religion et la galanterie.</HI> St. Palaye, tome i. p. 7. The poets of the&s;e times be|gan, in like manner, the de&s;cription of a &s;avage con|flict, or of their lady's graces, with religious invocation. Many examples of which appear in the <HI>Hi&s;toire des Trou|badours</HI> of L'Abb&eacute; Milot, and the <HI>Specimens of Wel&s;h Poetry</HI> publi&s;hed by Mr. Evans. So blind is the untu|tored mind to the proper di&s;crimination of it's ideas!</P>
<P>V. 179. <HI>Playand Pibrochs.</HI>] Of the <HI>pibroch</HI> I can|not give a better account than in the words of an ex|cellent author. <Q>A pibroch is a &s;pecies of tune pe|culiar, I think, to the Highlands and We&s;tern I&s;les of Scotland. It is performed on a bagpipe, and differs totally from all other mu&s;ic. Its rythm is &s;o irregu|lar,
<PB N="125" REF="188">and its notes, e&s;pecially in the quick movement, &s;o mixed and huddled together, that a &s;tranger finds it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to reconcile his ear to it, &s;o as to perceive its modulation. Some of the&s;e <HI>pibrochs,</HI> being intended to repre&s;ent a battle, begin with a grave mo|tion re&s;embling a march, then gradually quicken into the on&s;et; run off with noi&s;y confu&s;ion, and turbu|lent rapidity, to imitate the conflict and pur&s;uit; then &s;well into a few flouri&s;hes of triumphant joy; and perhaps clo&s;e with the wild and &s;low wailings of a funeral proce&s;&s;ion. <BIBL><HI>E&s;&s;ays by Dr. Beattie,</HI> 8vo. ed. p. 422. <HI>note.</HI></BIBL></Q></P>
<P>V. 188. <HI>Eir faes their dint mote drie.</HI>] This is &s;ub&s;ti|tuted in place of a line of con&s;ummate non&s;en&s;e, which has &s;tained all the former editions. Many &s;uch are cor|rected in this impre&s;&s;ion from comparing different re|hear&s;als, and &s;till more from conjecture. When an ig|norant per&s;on is de&s;ired to repeat a ballad, and is at a lo&s;s for the original expre&s;&s;ion, he naturally &s;upplies it with whatever ab&s;urdity fir&s;t occurs to him, that will form a rime. The&s;e the Editor made not the &s;malle&s;t &s;cruple to correct, as he always imagined that common &s;en&s;e might have its u&s;e even in emendatory critici&s;m.</P>
<P>V. 203. <HI>But on his forehead,</HI> &amp;c.] The circum&s;tances in this de&s;cription &s;eem borrowed from tho&s;e of different battles betwixt the Kings of Scotland and Norway. I find in no hi&s;torian that Alexander was wounded in the battle of Largs; on the contrary, it is even doubted
<PB N="126" REF="189">whether he was pre&s;ent; but in that near <HI>Nairn</HI> Mal|colm II. was wounded on the head. <HI>Rex, accepto in capite vulnere, vix a &s;uis in propinquum nemus ablatus, ac ibi equo pofitus, mortem eva&s;it.</HI> Buchan. lib. VI.</P>
<P>V. 223. <HI>Hire dames to wail your darling's fall.</HI>] This cu&s;tom of employing women to mourn for the warriors who fell in battle, may be traced to the mo&s;t di&s;tant antiquity. Lucilius, one of the earlie&s;t Roman poets, in a couplet pre&s;erved by Nonius, mentions this prac|tice;
<Q><L><HI>Mercede quae conductae flent alieno in fanere praeficae</HI></L>
<L><HI>Multae &amp; capillos &s;cindunt, &amp; clamant magis.</HI></L></Q> Among the Northern nations it partook of their bar|barity. <Q>Inter eas autem ceremonias a barbara gente acceptas fui&s;&s;e et has, ut genas roderunt mulierculae, hoc e&s;t unguibus faciem dilaniarent et <HI>le&s;&s;um</HI> facerent, id e&s;t &s;anguinem e venis mitterent, doloris te&s;tandi ergo; id quod Germani patria voce dicunt, <HI>Ein la&s;&s;u thun oder baben.</HI> <BIBL>Elias Schedius <HI>de Diis Germ.</HI> Syng. II. c. 51.</BIBL></Q> A &s;imilar mode of te&s;tifying their grief for the death of their chiefs, &s;till obtains in the Highlands, as we are informed by Mr. Pennant in his amu&s;ing <HI>Tour in Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>V. 225. <HI>Co&s;tly Jupe.</HI>] This was the <HI>Sagum,</HI> or mili|tary ve&s;t of the Gauls and Germans. Dr. Stuart has with curious ingenuity derived the &s;cience of Blazonry from the ornaments which were in time added to them. <HI>Ubi &s;upra,</HI> p. 286, 287.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="190">Virgil has a pa&s;&s;age remarkably &s;imilar to this, in de&s;cribing the habit of the Gauls, I think in Aeneid VIII.
<Q><L>Aurea cae&s;aries illis, atque aurea ve&s;tis</L>
<L>Virgatis lucet &s;agulis.</L></Q></P>
<P>V. 229. <HI>Beir Nor&s;e that gift,</HI> &amp;c.] This has been generally mi&s;under&s;tood: the meaning is, <HI>Bear that gift to the King of Norway, and bid,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>V. 239. 245.] The&s;e vaunts are much in Homer's manner, and are finely characteri&s;tic. The ob&s;cure metaphor which conveys them illu&s;trates a beautiful re|mark of an ancient critic, That allegory has a &s;ublime effect when applied to threatning. <GAP DESC="foreign">. Demet. Phal. de Eloc. c. 99.</P>
<P>V. 265. <HI>Whar lyke a fyre to hether &s;et.</HI>] This appo&s;ite &s;imile alludes to an ancient practice of the Scots, termed <HI>Mure burning.</HI> The progre&s;s of the flame was &s;o quick, that many laws appear in their Acts of Parliament, pro|hibiting its being u&s;ed when any corn was &s;tanding on ground adjacent to the heath intended to be burnt, though at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the &s;pot where the flame was kindled.</P>
<P>V. 285. <HI>Sore taken he was, fey!</HI>] <HI>Fey</HI> here &s;ignifies only indeed, <HI>in fay,</HI> or, in faith: it is commonly u&s;ed by the old Scoti&s;h poets in a &s;arca&s;tic or ironical &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="191">V. 305. <HI>On Norway's coa&s;t,</HI> &amp;c.] The&s;e ver&s;es are in the fine&s;t &s;tyle of Ballad poetry. They have been well imitated by a modern writer, who &s;eems indebted, for the be&s;t &s;trokes of his fir&s;t production, to a ta&s;te for &s;uch compo&s;itions:
<Q><L>Ye dames of Denmark! even for you I feel,</L>
<L>Who, &s;adly &s;itting on the &s;ea-beat &s;hore,</L>
<L>Long look for Lords that never &s;hall return,</L>
<BIBL><HI>Douglas,</HI> Act III.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>I cannot conclude my ob&s;ervations upon the de&s;crip|tion here given of the battle, without adding, that though perhaps not the mo&s;t &s;ublime, it is the mo&s;t animated and intere&s;ting to be found in any poet. It yields not to any in O&s;&s;ian for lively painting, nor to any in Homer for tho&s;e little anecdotes and &s;trokes of nature, which are &s;o de&s;ervedly admired in that ma&s;|ter. 'Poetry and Rhetoric,' &s;ays the author of an En|quiry into the origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful, <Q>do not &s;ucceed in exact de&s;cription &s;o well as Painting does; their bu&s;ine&s;s is to affect rather by &s;ympathy than imitation; to di&s;play rather the effect of things on the mind of the &s;peaker, or of others, than to pre&s;ent a clear idea of the things them&s;elves. This is their mo&s;t exten&s;ive province, and that in which they &s;ucceed the be&s;t.</Q> Will he forgive me if I offer this rude Scoti&s;h Poem as an example &s;ufficiently illu&s;trative of this fine remark?</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="192">V. 321. <HI>Loud and chill blew the We&s;tlin wind,</HI> &amp;c.] This &s;torm is artfully rai&s;ed by the magic of Poetry to heighten the terrible, which is &s;oon carried to a degree not &s;urpa&s;&s;ed in any production ancient or modern. It will recall to the reader the like artifice employed in the mo&s;t &s;ublime pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Ta&s;&s;o's Gieru&s;alemme,</HI> end of Canto 7.; and of <HI>Homer's Iliad,</HI> VIII. ver. 161. of Mr. Pope's Tran&s;lation.</P>
<P>V. 327. <HI>Seimd now as black as moruning weid.</HI>] It was anciently the cu&s;tom on any mournful event to hang the ca&s;tle gates with black cloth. This is alluded to here, and more particularly mentioned in an excellent modern Ballad, entitled <HI>The Birth of St. George,</HI> which di&s;plays no mean knowledge of the manners of chivalry:
<Q><L>But when he reached his ca&s;tle gate</L>
<L>His gate was hung with black.</L>

<P>V. 362.] It was the priviledge of the knights to hide their faces with armour, &s;o that it was impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;tingui&s;h any one from another, except by his <HI>blazon,</HI> which &s;eems at fir&s;t to have been di&s;played over them, but came at length to be painted on their &s;hields, whence <HI>Coats of Arms.</HI> A <HI>villein</HI> was obliged to have his countenance uncovered in battle.

<P>V. 389. <HI>Cheir ye my</HI> mirrie men, &amp;c.] It &s;hould have been remarked on the fir&s;t appearance of this word, P.

<P>V. 413. <HI>Oh King of Hevin!</HI>] This is a common ap|pellation of the Deity with the more ancient Scotti&s;h Poets. <HI>By Hevins King,</HI> is the familiar oath of <HI>Blind Harrie's</HI> heroes.</P>
<P>V. 419. <HI>By my Forbere's &s;aul.</HI>] Swearing by the &s;ouls of their ance&s;tors was another u&s;ed mode in tho&s;e times. The greate&s;t thought this oath mo&s;t &s;trong and honour|able; probably becau&s;e it implied the &s;ouls of their forefathers were in heaven, and, as was then believed, might lend them a &s;upernatural aid, if the intention of their oath was ju&s;t and unblameable.</P>
<P>V. 421. '<HI>Now mind your aith,</HI>' &amp;c.] This pa&s;&s;age is ob&s;cure: the meaning I apprehend is, that Draffan
<PB N="135" REF="198">had, before the combat, exacted an oath of Allan his baneret, that he would &s;lay him, &s;hould the nece&s;&s;ity of his affairs demand this &s;acrifice. More willing to lo&s;e his own life than po&s;&s;ibly to take that of his great anta|goni&s;t, he commands Allan to fulfil his engagement, which, with all the heroic faith of tho&s;e times, he does without a pau&s;e. The particular expre&s;&s;ion <Q><HI>The</HI> &s;hynand blade</Q> might lead us to imagine, that it was thought impo&s;&s;ible to pierce the &s;uppo&s;ed enchanted armour, but with one particular weapon, likeways perhaps <HI>charmed.</HI></P>
<P>V. 437. <HI>Icolm.</HI>] The Nunnery at Icolm, or Icolm|kill, was one of the mo&s;t noted in Scotland. The Nuns were of the order of <HI>Augu&s;tine,</HI> and wore a white gown, and above it a rocket of fine linen. <HI>Spoti&s;wood's Account of the Religious Hou&s;es in Scotland,</HI> p. 509. The ruins of this nunnery are &s;till to be &s;een, with many tombs of the Prince&s;&s;es; one of which bears the year 1000. <HI>Martin's We&s;tern I&s;lands,</HI> p. 262.</P>
<P>I cannot conclude my remarks on this Poem without wa&s;ting one on the &s;tory of Mrs. Wardlaw. That this lady may have indeed received a MS. of it as mentioned in Dr. Percy's introductory note, is highly probable. Many valuable MSS. prepared for the pre&s;s, have had a wor&s;e fate. But that &s;he was the author of this capital compo&s;ition, &s;o fraught with &s;cience of ancient manners as the above notes te&s;tify, I will no more credit, than that the common people in Lanark&s;hire,
<PB N="136" REF="199">who can repeat &s;craps of both the parts, are the authors of the pa&s;&s;ages they rehear&s;e. That &s;he did not refu&s;e the name of being the original compo&s;er is a &s;trange argument: would not the fir&s;t poet in Europe think it added to his reputation? If conjecture may be allowed where proof mu&s;t ever be wanting, I &s;u&s;pect, if we a&s;&s;ign the end of the fifteenth century as the date of the antique parts of this noble production, we &s;hall not greatly err; though at the &s;ame time the language mu&s;t convince us that many &s;trokes have been be&s;towed by modern hands.</P>
<P>Since the fir&s;t publication of this volume, Sir David Dalrymple, Lord Hales, who&s;e abilities have been &s;o often, and &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully, exerted in illu&s;trating the antiquities of his country, to the law and the literature of which he is &s;o great an ornament, has communi|cated to the Editor &s;ome notices with regard to this poem of Hardyknute, which &s;hall here be laid before the reader, almo&s;t in his own words.</P>
<P>The following are extracts of a letter written by Sir John Bruce of Kinro&s;s, to Lord Binning, about the year 1719.</P>
<P><Q>To perform my promi&s;e, I &s;end you a true copy of the manu&s;cript I found, &s;ome weeks ago, in a vault at Dumferline. It is written on vellum in a fair Gothic character; but &s;o much defaced by time, as you'll find that the tenth part is not legible.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="200">Sir John tran&s;cribes &s;ome &s;tanzas, which he calls <HI>ver&s;es.</HI> After l. 112, P. I. he &s;ays, <Q>here are four ver&s;es defaced,</Q> and then he tran&s;cribes l. 113.</P>
<P>At l. 128 he adds, <HI>hiatus in MS.</HI> and then he tran|&s;cribes l. 153. At l. 320 he &s;ays, <Q>Here are ten ver&s;es (&s;tanzas) &s;o &s;poilt that I can only gue&s;s by the many proper names, that they contain the order of battle of the Scots army, as they &s;tood ranged under their different chieftains.</Q></P>
<P>In conclu&s;ion Sir John &s;ays, <Q>there's a va&s;t deal more of it, but all defaced.</Q></P>
<P>The reader is left to judge whether this &s;tory of the manu&s;cript on vellum, &amp;c. has mo&s;t the appearance of a true narrative, or of a <HI>jeu d' e&s;prit</HI> addre&s;&s;ed to a fami|liar friend.</P>
<P>Lord Hales has a copy of the original edition of Har|dyknute, with MS. alterations, in the hand writing of Dr. John Clerk, Phy&s;ician in Edinburgh. At l. 85, it has '<HI>brade</HI> Thomas;' Sir John Bruce has <Q><HI>bred</HI> Mal|colm.</Q> At l. 98, Sir John Bruce's MS. has 'Walter' in&s;tead of 'Malcolm.' At l. 103, 'brazen' for '&s;ilver;' and at l. 104, 'iron doors,' for <Q>painted bowers.</Q></P>
<P>In Dr. Clerk's MS. lines, 176&mdash;180 run thus;
<Q><L>To join his king adown the hill,</L>
<L>In ha&s;t his &s;trides he bent;</L>

<P>THIS is undoubtedly the true title of this incom|parable Ballad, though corrupted into Gil Mor|rice by the nur&s;es and old women, from who&s;e mouths it was originally publi&s;hed. <HI>Child</HI> &s;eems to have been of equal importance with <HI>Damoi&s;eau</HI> (See note on P.

<P>THE &s;tanzas here given form a complete copy of this exqui&s;ite Dirge. The inimitable beauty of the original induced a variety of ver&s;ifiers to mingle &s;tanzas of their own compo&s;ure. But it is the painful, though mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary duty of an Editor, by the touch|&s;tone of truth, to di&s;criminate &s;uch dro&s;s from the gold of antiquity.</P>
<P>SIR PATRICK SPENCE is given from Dr. Percy's Edition, which indeed agrees with the &s;tall copies, and the common recitals. I have, however, lent it a few corrections, where palpable ab|&s;urdity &s;eemed to require them. The phra&s;e in v. 25. of &s;eeing the old moon <HI>in the arms</HI> of the new is &s;till fa|miliar in Scotland. It means that the opaque part of the moon's di&s;k ca&s;ts a glimmering light, while the illumi|nated part is waxing; and is to this hour e&s;teemed to progno&s;ticate a &s;torm.</P>

<P>In the &s;ame Manu&s;cript <HI>(p.</HI> 17. and 116) are to be found the two following Poems, which I believe have never been in print. They are here added, with a few corrections. They were both written by Sir Robert Aytoun, who bore &s;ome office under government in the reign of James VI. if I mi&s;take not. His Latin poems are in the Delitiae Poetarum Scotorum.</P>
