<P>_AS I have a&s;&s;umed the character of CENSOR GENERAL, I
&s;hall follow the example of the old Roman Cen&s;or; the fir&s;t part of
who&s;e duty was to review the people, and di&s;tribute them into their
&s;everal Divi|&s;ions: I &s;hall therefore enter upon my office, by taking a
cur&s;ory &s;urvey of what is u&s;ually called <HI>The</HI> TOWN. In this I
&s;hall not confine my&s;elf to the exact method of a Geographer, but carry the
reader from one quarter to another, as it may &s;uit my convenience, or be&s;t
contri|bute to his entertainment.</P>
<P>WHEN a Comedian, celebrated for his excellence in the part of
Shylock, fir&s;t undertook that character, he made daily vi&s;its to the center
of bu&s;ine&s;s, the 'Change, and the adjacent Coffee-hou&s;es; that by a
frequent intercour&s;e and conver&s;ation with 
<Q REND="inline">"the unfore&s;kinn'd race,"</Q> he might
ha|bituate him&s;elf to their air and deportment. A like de&s;ire 
<PB N="2" REF="3"> of penetrating into the mo&s;t &s;ecret &s;prings of action
in the&s;e people, has often led Me there; but I was never more diverted than
at <HI>Garraway</HI>'s a few days before the draw|ing of the lottery. I not
only could read Hope, Fear, and all the various pa&s;&s;ions excited by a love
of gain, &s;trongly pictured in the faces of tho&s;e who came to buy; but I
re|marked with no le&s;s delight, the many little artifices made u&s;e of to
allure adventurers, as well as the vi&s;ible altera|tions in the looks of the
&s;ellers, according as the demand for tickets gave occa&s;ion to rai&s;e or
lower their price. So deeply were the countenances of the&s;e Bubble-Brokers
im|pre&s;&s;ed with an attention to the main chance, and their minds &s;eemed
&s;o dead to all other &s;en&s;ations, that one might almo&s;t doubt, where
money is out of the ca&s;e, whether a Jew 
<Q REND="inline">"has eyes, hands, organs, dimen&s;ions,
&s;en&s;es, af|fections, pa&s;&s;ions."</Q></P>
<P>FROM <HI>Garraway</HI>'s it is but a &s;hort &s;tep to a gloomy
cla&s;s of mortals, not le&s;s intent on gain than the Stock|jobber: I mean the
di&s;pen&s;ers of life and death, who flock together, like birds of prey
watching for carca&s;es, at <HI>Bat|&s;on</HI>'s. I never enter this place, but
it &s;erves as a <HI>memento mori</HI> to me. What a formal a&s;&s;emblage of
&s;able &s;uits, and tremen|dous perukes! I have often met here a mo&s;t
intimate ac|quaintance, whom I have &s;carce known again; a &s;prightly young
fellow, with whom I have &s;pent many a jolly hour; but being ju&s;t dubb'd a
Graduate in Phy&s;ick, he has gain'd &s;uch an entire conque&s;t over the
ri&s;ible mu&s;cles, that he hardly vouch&s;afes at any time to &s;mile. I have
heard him harangue, with all the oracular importance of a veteran, on the
po&s;&s;ibility of CANNING's &s;ub&s;i&s;ting for a whole month on a few bits
of bread; and he is now preparing a treati&s;e, in which will be &s;et forth a
new and infallible method to prevent the &s;preading of the plague from
<HI>France</HI> into <HI>England. Bat&s;on</HI>'s has been reckon'd the &s;eat
of &s;olemn &s;tupidity: yet is it not totally devoid of ta&s;te and common
&s;en&s;e. They have among them Phy&s;icians who can cope with the mo&s;t
eminent Lawyers or Divines; and Critics, who can reli&s;h the <HI>&s;al
volatile</HI> of a witty compo&s;ition, or <PB N="3" REF="4"> determine how
much <HI>fire</HI> is requi&s;ite to <HI>&s;ublimate</HI> a tragedy
<HI>&s;ecund&ugrave;m artem.</HI></P>
<P>EMERGING from the&s;e di&s;mal regions, I am glad to breath the
pure air in St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Coffee-hou&s;e: where (as I profe&s;s the
highe&s;t veneration for our Clergy) I can|not contemplate the magnificence of
the cathedral without reflecting on the abject condition of tho&s;e 
<Q REND="inline">"tatter'd crapes,"</Q> who are &s;aid to ply
here for an occa&s;ional Burial or Sermon, with the &s;ame regularity as the
happier drudges, who &s;alute us with the cry of 
<Q REND="inline">"coach &s;ir,"</Q> or 
<Q REND="inline">"chair your honour."</Q></P>
<P>And here my Publi&s;her would not forgive me, was I to leave the
neighbourhood without taking notice of the <HI>Chapter</HI> Coffee-hou&s;e,
which is frequented by tho&s;e en|couragers of literature, and (as they are
&s;tiled by an emi|nent Critic) 
<Q REND="inline">"not the wor&s;t judges of merit,"</Q> the
Book|&s;ellers. The conver&s;ation here naturally turns upon the newe&s;t
publications, but their critici&s;ms are &s;omething &s;in|gular. When they
&s;ay a <HI>good</HI> book, they do not mean to prai&s;e the &s;tyle or
&s;entiment, but the quick and exten&s;ive &s;ale of it. That book in the
phra&s;e of the CONGER is be&s;t, which &s;ells mo&s;t; and if the demand for
QUARLES &s;hould be greater than for POPE, he would have the highe&s;t place on
the rubric po&s;t. There are al&s;o many parts of every work liable to their
remarks, which fall not within the notice of le&s;s accurate ob&s;ervers. A few
nights ago I &s;aw one of the&s;e gentlemen take up a Sermon, and after
&s;eeming to peru&s;e it for &s;ome time with great attention, he declared 
<Q REND="inline">"it was very good <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI>"</Q> The
reader will judge whether I was mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ed or diverted, when I
di&s;covered, that he was not commending the purity and elegance of the
diction, but the beauty of the <HI>type,</HI> which, it &s;eems, is known
a|mong the printers by that appellation. We mu&s;t not however think the
members of the CONGER &s;trangers to the deeper parts of literature; for as
Carpenters, Smiths, Ma&s;ons, and all Handicraft&s;men &s;mell of the trade
they labour at, Book|&s;ellers take a peculiar turn from their connexions with
books and authors. The character of the Book&s;eller is commonly 
<PB N="4" REF="5"> formed on the writers in his &s;ervice. Thus one is a
poli|tician or a dei&s;t; another affects humour, or aims at turns of wit and
repartee; while a third perhaps is grave, moral, and &s;ententious.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Temple</HI> is the barrier that divides the City and
Suburbs, and the gentlemen who re&s;ide there &s;eem influ|enced by the
&s;ituation of the place they inhabit. Tem|plers are, in general, a kind of
citizen-courtiers. They aim at the air and mien of the drawing-room, but the
holiday &s;martne&s;s of a prentice, heightened with &s;ome additional touches
of the rake or coxcomb, betrays it&s;elf in every thing they do. The
<HI>Temple</HI> however is &s;tock'd with it's peculiar beaus, wits, poets,
critics, and every character in the gay world. And it is a thou&s;and pities,
that &s;o pretty a &s;ociety &s;hould be di&s;graced with a few dull fellows,
who can &s;ubmit to puzzle them&s;elves with Ca&s;es and Reports, and have not
ta&s;te enough to follow the genteel method of &s;tudying the law.</P>
<P>I SHALL now, like a true Student of the <HI>Temple,</HI> hurry
from thence to <HI>Covent-Garden,</HI> the acknowledg'd region of gallan|try,
wit, and critici&s;m; and hope to be excu&s;ed for not &s;top|ping at
<HI>George</HI>'s in my way, as the <HI>Bedford</HI> affords a greater variety
of nearly the &s;ame characters. This Coffee-hou&s;e is every night crowded
with men of parts. Almo&s;t every one you meet is a polite &s;cholar and a wit.
Jokes and <HI>bon mots</HI> are echo'd from box to box; every branch of
literature is critically exa|mined, and the merit of every production of the
pre&s;s, or performance at the theatres, weighed and determined. This &s;chool
(to which I am my&s;elf indebted for a great part of my education, and in
which, though unworthy, I am now ar|rived at the honour of being a public
lecturer) has bred up many authors, to the amazing entertainment and
in&s;truction of their readers. <HI>Button</HI>'s, the grand archetype of the
<HI>Bed|ford,</HI> was frequented by <HI>Addi&s;on, Steele, Pope,</HI> and the
re&s;t of that celebrated &s;et, who flouri&s;hed at the beginning of this
century, and was regarded with ju&s;t deference on ac|count of the real
geniu&s;&s;es who frequented it. But we can now boa&s;t men of &s;uperior
abilities; men, who without any one <PB N="5" REF="6"> acquired excellence, by
the mere dint of an happy a&s;&s;urance, can exact the &s;ame tribute of
veneration, and receive it as due to the illu&s;trious characters, the
Scribblers, Players, Fidlers, Gamblers, that make &s;o large a part of the
com|pany at the <HI>Bedford.</HI></P>
<P>NOW, &s;ince Mr. MACKLIN is not yet prepared to receive us, I
&s;hall take leave of <HI>Covent-Garden,</HI> and de&s;ire the Reader's company
to <HI>White</HI>'s. Here (as <HI>Vanbrugh</HI> &s;ays of <HI>Locket</HI>'s) 
<Q REND="inline">"He may have a di&s;h no bigger than a &s;aucer,
that &s;hall co&s;t him fifty &s;hillings."</Q> The great people, who frequent
this place, do not interrupt their politer amu&s;ements, like the wretches at
<HI>Garraway</HI>'s, with bu&s;ine&s;s, any farther than to go down to
We&s;tmin&s;ter one Se&s;&s;ions to vote for a Bill, and the next to repeal it.
Nor do they trouble them&s;elves with literary debates, as at the
<HI>Bedford.</HI> Learn|ing is beneath the notice of a Man of Quality. They
employ them&s;elves more fa&s;hionably at whi&s;t for the trifle of a
thou&s;and pounds the rubber, or by making bets on the lye of the day.</P>
<P>FROM this very genteel place the Reader mu&s;t not be
&s;urpri&s;ed, if I &s;hould convey him to a Cellar, or a common
Porter-hou&s;e. For as it is my province to delineate, and re|mark on mankind
in general, whoever becomes my di&s;ciple mu&s;t not refu&s;e to follow me from
the <HI>King's-Arms</HI> to the <HI>Goo&s;e and Gridiron,</HI> and be content
to climb after me up to an Author's garret, or give me leave to introduce him
to a Route. In my pre&s;ent cur&s;ory view of the TOWN I have indeed confined
my&s;elf principally to Coffee-hou&s;es, tho' I con&s;tantly vi&s;it all places
that afford any matter for &s;pecula|tion. I am a Scotchman at
<HI>Forre&s;ter</HI>'s, a Frenchman at <HI>Slaughter</HI>'s, and at the
<HI>Cocoa-Tree</HI> I am &mdash; an ENGLISHMAN. At the <HI>Robin Hood</HI> I am
a Politician, a Logician, a Geo|metrician, a Phy&s;ician, a Metaphy&s;ician, a
Ca&s;ui&s;t, a Mo|rali&s;t, a Theologi&s;t, a Mythologi&s;t, or any
thing&mdash;but an Athei&s;t. Wherever the WORLD is, I am. You will therefore
hear of me &s;ometimes at the Theatres, &s;ometimes perhaps at the Opera; nor
&s;hall I think the exhibitions of <PB N="4" REF="7"> <HI>Sadler's Wells,</HI>
or the Little Theatre in the <HI>Haymarket,</HI> be|neath my notice; but may
one day or other give a di&s;&s;ertation upon <HI>Tumbling,</HI> or (if they
&s;hould again become popular) a critique on <HI>Dogs</HI> and
<HI>Monkeys.</HI></P>
<P>THOUGH the Town is the walk I &s;hall general|ly appear in, let
it not be imagined that Vice and Folly will &s;hoot up unnoticed in the
Country. My cou|&s;in VILLAGE has undertaken that province, and will &s;end me
the fre&s;he&s;t advices of every fault or foible that takes root there. But as
it is my chief ambition to plea&s;e and in&s;truct the Ladies, I &s;hall
embrace every opportunity of devoting my labours to their &s;ervice: and I may
with ju&s;tice congratulate my&s;elf upon the happine&s;s of living in an age,
when the female part of the world are &s;o &s;tudious to find employment for a
CENSOR.</P>
<P>THE character of Mr. TOWN is, I flatter my&s;elf, too well known
to need an explanation. How far, and in what &s;en&s;e, I propo&s;e to be a
CONNOISSEUR, the learned reader will gather from my general Motto: 
<Q> 
<L>&mdash;Non de villis domibu&s;ve alienis,</L>

<BIBL>HOR.</BIBL></Q> As CRITIC and CENSOR GENERAL, I &s;hall
take the liberty to animadvert on every thing that appears to me vicious or
ridiculous; always endeavouring 
<Q REND="inline">"to hold, as 'twere, the mirrour up to Nature,
to &s;hew Virtue her own feature, Scorn her own image, and the very age and
body of the Time his form and pre&s;&s;ure."</Q></P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. **** ******.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE hurry in which I left <HI>England</HI> mu&s;t have
con|vinced you how much I was in earne&s;t, when I talked of making a valuable
collection of Pictures. By my fre|quent attendance on &s;ales, I already know
almo&s;t as much of Painting as I do of the Funds; and can talk as learnedly of
Light and Shade, Figure, Proportion, Drapery, &amp;c. as of the ri&s;e and fall
of Stocks. I have however been very much embarra&s;&s;ed in getting together a
collection &s;uitable to the religion I profe&s;s. The famous Painters were
mo&s;t of them &s;uch bigots to their own way of thinking, that they have
&s;carce left any thing behind them but <HI>Holy Families, dead Chri&s;ts,</HI>
and <HI>Madonas</HI>; &s;ubjects which to <PB N="10" REF="11"> Me and my Tribe
are odious and abominable. A Pic|ture, &s;ince it has the property of being the
language of all mankind, &s;hould never be particular in it's &s;ubject; but we
&s;hould paint, as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are taught to pray, 
<Q REND="inline">"for all Jews, Turks, Infidels and
Hereticks."</Q></P>
<P>WHEN I have made the tour of <HI>Italy,</HI> I will &s;end you
a complete li&s;t of all my purcha&s;es: in the mean time, the following
&s;hort &s;pecimen will enable you to judge of my precautions in &s;electing
Pieces &s;uitable to my character, and not offen&s;ive to my principles.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t that I bought was "the Elevation of the GOLDEN
CALF." This I &s;hall &s;et up in the <HI>Royal Ex|change,</HI> as a typical
repre&s;entation of my&s;elf, to be wor|&s;hipp'd by all Brokers, In&s;urers,
Scriveners, and the whole fraternity of Stock-jobbers.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd is "the Triumph of GIDEON." This I intended, if a
late project in favour of our brethren had not mi&s;carried, to have been hung
up in St. <HI>Stephen</HI>'s Chapel, as a memorial of our victory over the
Uncir|cumci&s;ed.</P>
<P>THE third and fourth are "PETER denying his Ma|&s;ter," and
"JUDAS betraying him for thirty pieces of &s;ilver;" both which I de&s;ign as
pre&s;ents to our two worthy friends the B&mdash;s of &mdash; and &mdash;.</P>
<P>THE next which I &s;hall mention to you, de&s;erves
parti|cular notice; and this is "the Prophet of <HI>Nazareth</HI> him&s;elf,
conjuring the Devil into an Herd of Swine." From this piece, when I return to
<HI>England,</HI> I intend to have a Print engraved; being very proper to be
had in all <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> fami|lies, as a nece&s;&s;ary pre&s;ervative
again&s;t Pork, and Chri|&s;tianity.</P>

<P>I Suppo&s;e CONNOISSEUR is only another word for a KNOWING

you for, you will be wi&s;e, and do this directly; and then the Odds are for
you. If not, I'll hold you a hundred Pounds to a China Orange, that your paper
is neglected as low and vulgar, and your&s;elf condemn'd as an unfa&s;hion|able

<P>_WE Writers of E&s;&s;ays, or (as they are termed) Periodical
Papers, ju&s;tly claim to our&s;elves a place among the modern improvers of
li|terature. Neither <HI>Bentley</HI> nor <HI>Burman,</HI> nor any equally
&s;agacious Commentator, has been able to di&s;cover the lea&s;t traces of any
&s;imilar produc|tions among the Ancients: except we can &s;uppo&s;e, that the
Hi&s;tory of <HI>Thucydides</HI> was retailed weekly in &s;ix-penny numbers;
that <HI>Seneca</HI> dealt out his Morality every Saturday; or that
<HI>Tully</HI> wrote Speeches and Philo&s;ophical Di&s;qui&s;itions, whil&s;t
<HI>Virgil</HI> and <HI>Horace</HI> clubb'd together to furni&s;h the Poetry
for a <HI>Roman</HI> Magazine.</P>
<P>THERE is a word indeed, by which we are fond of
di&s;tingui&s;hing our works, and for which we mu&s;t confe&s;s 
<PB N="14" REF="19"> our&s;elves indebted to the <HI>Latin.</HI> My&s;elf, and
every petty Journali&s;t, affect to dignify our ha&s;ty performances by
&s;tiling them LUCUBRATIONS: by which we mean, if we mean any thing, that as
the day is too &s;hort for our labours, we are obliged to call in the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the night: not to mention the mode&s;t in&s;inuation, that
our compo&s;itions are &s;o correct, that, like the Orations of
<HI>Demo&s;thenes,</HI> they may be &s;aid to <HI>&s;mell of the lamp.</HI> We
would be under&s;tood to follow the directions of the <HI>Roman</HI>
Satiri&s;t, 
<Q REND="inline">"to grow pale by the midnight candle;"</Q>
though perhaps, as our own Satiri&s;t expre&s;&s;es it, we may be thought 
<Q> 
<L>"Sleeple&s;s our&s;elves to give our readers
&s;leep."</L></Q> But, as a relief from the fatigue of &s;o many re&s;tle&s;s
hours, we have frequently <HI>gone to &s;leep</HI> for the benefit of the
public: and &s;urely we, who&s;e labours are confined to a &s;heet and half,
may be indulged in taking a nap now and then, &s;ince a modern DREAMER has
outdone even BUNYAN in &s;tile and &s;entiment, and pompou&s;ly dozed through
an whole Octavo.</P>
<P>AFTER this preface, the reader will not be &s;urprized if I take
the liberty to relate a Dream of my own. It is u&s;ual on the&s;e occa&s;ions
to be lulled to &s;leep by &s;ome book; and mo&s;t of my brethren pay that
compliment to <HI>Virgil</HI> or <HI>Shake&s;peare:</HI> but as I could never
di&s;cover any opiate quali|ties in tho&s;e authors, I cho&s;e to &s;lumber
over &s;ome modern performance. I mu&s;t beg to be excu&s;ed from mentioning
particulars, as I would not provoke the re&s;entment of my cotemporaries:
Nobody will imagine, that I dipt into any of our modern Novels, or took up any
of our late Trage|dies.&mdash;Let it &s;uffice, that I pre&s;ently fell fa&s;t
a&s;leep.</P>
<P>I FOUND my&s;elf tran&s;ported in an in&s;tant to the &s;hore of
an immen&s;e &s;ea, covered with innumerable ve&s;&s;els and tho' 
<PB N="15" REF="20"> many of them &s;uddenly di&s;appeared every minute, I
&s;aw others continually launching forth, and pur&s;uing the &s;ame cour&s;e.
The Seers of Vi&s;ions, and Dreamers of Dreams, have their organs of &s;ight
&s;o con&s;iderably improved, that they can take in any object, however
di&s;tant or minute. It is not therefore to be wonder'd at, that I could
di&s;cern every|thing di&s;tinctly, though the waters before me were of the
deepe&s;t black.</P>
<P>WHILE I &s;tood contemplating this amazing &s;cene, one of
tho&s;e good-natured <HI>Genii,</HI> who never fail making their appearance to
extricate Dreamers from their difficulties, ro&s;e from the &s;able &s;tream,
and planted him&s;elf at my elbow. His complexion was of the darke&s;t hue, not
unlike the <HI>Daemons</HI> of a printing-hou&s;e; his jetty beard &s;hone like
the bri&s;tles of a blacking-bru&s;h; on his head he wore a Turbant of Imperial
Paper; and 
<Q> 
<L>"There hung a Calf-&s;kin on his rev'rend limbs,"</L></Q>
which was gilt on the back, and faced with robings of <HI>Morocco,</HI>
letter'd (like a Rubric-po&s;t) with the names of the mo&s;t eminent authors.
In his right hand he bore a printed &s;croll, which from the marginal
corrections I ima|gin'd to be a Proof-&s;heet; and in his left he waved the
Quill of a Goo&s;e.</P>
<P>HE immediately acco&s;ted me.&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">"TOWN, &s;aid he, I am the <HI>Genius</HI> who
is de&s;tined to conduct you thro' the&s;e turbulent waves. The &s;ea that you
now behold is <HI>The</HI> OCEAN <HI>of</HI> INK. Tho&s;e towers, at a great
di&s;tance, who&s;e ba&s;es are founded upon rocks, and who&s;e tops &s;eem
lo&s;t in the clouds, are &s;ituated in <HI>The</HI> ISLES <HI>of</HI> FAME.
Contiguous to the&s;e, you may di&s;cern by the glittering of its golden
&s;ands <HI>The</HI> COAST <HI>of</HI> GAIN, which leads to a fertile and rich
country. All the ve&s;&s;els, which <PB N="16" REF="21"> are yonder &s;ailing
with a fair wind on the main &s;ea, are making towards one or other of the&s;e:
but you will ob|&s;erve, that on their fir&s;t &s;etting-out they were
irre&s;i&s;tibly drawn into <HI>The</HI> EDDIES <HI>of</HI> CRITICISM, where
they were obliged to encounter the mo&s;t dreadful tempe&s;ts and hurricanes.
In the&s;e dangerous &s;treights you &s;ee with what violence every bark is
to&s;t up and down; &s;ome go to the bottom at once; others, after a faint
&s;truggle, are beat to pieces; many are much damaged; while a few by &s;ound
planks and tight rigging are enabled to weather the &s;torm."</Q></P>
<P>AT this &s;ight I &s;tarted back with horror; and the
re|membrance &s;till dwells &s;o &s;trong upon my fancy, that I even now
imagine the Torrent of Critici&s;m bur&s;ting in upon me, and ready to
overwhelm me in an in&s;tant.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"Ca&s;t a look, re&s;umed my In&s;tructor, on
that va&s;t Lake divided into two parts, which lead to yonder magnificent
&s;tructures, erected by the <HI>Tragic</HI> and <HI>Comic Mu&s;e.</HI> There
you may ob&s;erve many trying to force a pa&s;&s;age without chart or
compa&s;s. Some have been over&s;et by crowding too much &s;ail, and others
have founder'd by carrying too much balla&s;t. An <HI>Arcadian</HI> ve&s;&s;el
(the ma&s;ter an <HI>Iri&s;h|man)</HI> was, thro' contrary &s;qualls, &s;carce
able to live nine days: but you &s;ee that light <HI>Italian</HI> Gondola,
<HI>Gli Amanti Gelo&s;i,</HI> &s;kims along plea&s;antly before the wind, and
out|&s;trips the painted Frigates of her country, <HI>Didone</HI> and
<HI>Arta&s;er&s;e.</HI> Ob&s;erve that triumphant Squadron, to who&s;e flag all
the others pay homage. Mo&s;t of them are &s;hips of the fir&s;t rate, and were
fitted out many years ago. Tho' &s;omewhat irregular in their make, and but
little conform|able to the exact rules of art, they will ever continue the
pride and glory of the&s;e &s;eas: for, as it is remarked by 
<PB N="17" REF="22"> the pre&s;ent Laureat in his Prologue to <HI>Papal
Tyranny,</HI></Q> 
<Q> 
<L>"<HI>Shake&s;peare,</HI> who&s;e art no play-wright cou'd
excell;</L> 
<L>"Has launch'd us fleets of plays, and built them
well."</L></Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Genius</HI> then bad me turn my eye, where the water
&s;eemed to foam with perpetual agitation. 
<Q REND="inline">"That, &s;aid he, is the &s;trong CURRENT
<HI>of</HI> POLITICS, often fatal to tho&s;e who venture on it."</Q> I could
not but take notice of a poor wretch on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, fa&s;ten'd by
the ears to a terrible machine. This the <HI>Genius</HI> informed me was the
memorable DEFOE, &s;et up there as a Land-mark, to prevent future mariners from
&s;plitting on the &s;ame rock.</P>
<P>TO this turbulent pro&s;pect &s;ucceeded objects of a more
placid nature. In a little creek winding thro' flow'ry meads and &s;hady
groves, I de&s;cried &s;everal gilded Yachts and Plea|&s;ure-Boats, all of them
keeping due time with their &s;ilver oars, and gliding along the &s;mooth,
even, calm, regularly-flowing RIVULETS <HI>of</HI> RHYME. Shepherds and
Shepherde&s;&s;es play'd on the banks; the &s;ails were gently &s;welled with
the &s;oft breezes of amorous Sighs, and little Loves &s;ported in the &s;ilken
cordage.</P>
<P>MY attention was now called off from the&s;e pacific &s;cenes to
an ob&s;tinate engagement between &s;everal &s;hips di&s;tingui&s;h'd from all
others by bearing the <HI>Holy Cro&s;s</HI> for their Colours. The&s;e, the
<HI>Genius</HI> told me, were employed in the <HI>Holy War</HI> of
<HI>Religious Controver&s;y</HI>; and he pointed out to me a few
<HI>Cor&s;airs</HI> in the &s;ervice of the <HI>Infidels,</HI> &s;ome|times
aiding one party, &s;ometimes &s;iding with the other, as might be&s;t
contribute to the general confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>IT were needle&s;s to enumerate many other particulars that
engaged my notice. Among the re&s;t was a large Fleet of Annotators,
<HI>Dutch</HI>-built, which &s;ailed very heavy, were <PB N="18" REF="23">
often a-ground, and continually ran foul on each other. The whole Ocean, I
al&s;o found, was infe&s;ted by Pyrates, who ran&s;acked every rich ve&s;&s;el
that came in their way. Mo&s;t of the&s;e were endeavouring to make the
<HI>Coa&s;t of Gain</HI> by hanging out Fal&s;e Colours, or by forging their
Pa&s;s-ports, and pretending to be freighted by the mo&s;t reputable
Traders.</P>
<P>MY eyes were at la&s;t fix'd, I know not how, on a &s;pa|cious
Channel running thro' the mid&s;t of a great City. I felt &s;uch a &s;ecret
impul&s;e at this &s;ight, that I could not help enquiring particularly about
it. 
<Q REND="inline">"The di&s;covery of that Pa&s;&s;age, &s;aid the
<HI>Genius,</HI> was fir&s;t made by one <HI>Bicker|&s;taff,</HI> in the good
&s;hip call'd <HI>The</HI> TATLER, and who af|terwards embarked in the
SPECTATOR and GUARDIAN. The&s;e have been followed &s;ince by a numerous
&s;hoal of little Sloops, Skiffs, Hoys, and Cock-boats, which have been mo&s;t
of them wreck'd in the attempt; and thither al&s;o mu&s;t your cour&s;e be
directed."</Q> At this in&s;tant the <HI>Genius</HI> &s;uddenly &s;natch'd me
up in his arms, and plunged me headlong into the inky flood. While I lay
ga&s;ping and &s;truggling beneath the waves, methought I heard a familiar
voice calling me by my name; which awaking me, I with plea&s;ure recollected
the features of the <HI>Genius</HI> in tho&s;e of my Publi&s;her, who was
&s;tanding by my bed &s;ide, and had called upon me for Copy.</P>

<P>I MAY perhaps take a future opportunity of enlarging on this
very important &s;ubject, the MARRIAGE-BILL; but &s;hall at pre&s;ent oblige
the ladies by celebrating an Order of Females lately &s;prung up among&s;t us,
u&s;ually di&s;tingui&s;h'd by the denomination of DEMI-REPS;&mdash;a word not
to be found in any of our Dictionaries.</P>
<P>THIS Order, which &s;eems daily encrea&s;ing upon us, was
fir&s;t in&s;tituted by &s;ome ladies eminent for their public &s;pirit, with a
view of rai&s;ing their half of the &s;pecies to a level with the other in the
unbounded licence of their enjoy|ments. By this artifice the mo&s;t open
violation of mode&s;ty takes the name of innocent freedom and gaiety; and as
long as the la&s;t failing remains a &s;ecret, the lady's honour is
&s;potle&s;s and untainted. In a word, a DEMI-REP is a lady whom every body
thinks what no body chu&s;es to call her.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="26">IT is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that every
lady of this Order &s;hould be married. Cu&s;tom has given a certain charm to
wedlock, which changes the colour of our actions, and renders that behaviour
not improper, which in a &s;tate of celibacy would be accounted indecent and
&s;candalous. As to the Promi&s;es made in marriage 
<Q REND="inline">"to love, honour and obey,"</Q> cu&s;tom has
made Them al&s;o merely ceremonial, and in fact as little binding as the
wedding-ring, which may be put on or pulled off at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>RELIGIOUS and political writers have both for different
rea&s;ons endeavoured to encourage frequent marriages: but this Order, if it
maintains it's ground, will more certainly promote them. How inviting mu&s;t
&s;uch a &s;tate appear to a woman of &s;pirit! An <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> wife with
all the indi&s;cre|tions of a girl may a&s;&s;ume more than the privileges of a
woman, may trifle publicly with the beaux and &s;marts, introduce them to her
toilette, and fix it as a certain rule in all her conver&s;ation and behaviour,
that when once mar|riage has (in <HI>Lucy</HI>'s phra&s;e) 
<Q REND="inline">"made an hone&s;t woman of her,"</Q> &s;he is
intitled to all the licence of a courtezan.</P>
<P>I HAVE lately &s;een, with a good deal of compa&s;&s;ion, a few
forward maiden ladies inve&s;ting them&s;elves with the dignities, and
incroaching on the privileges of this Order. It may not be improper to caution
them to recede in time. As their claim to the&s;e liberties is unwarranted by
cu&s;tom, they will not retain that ambiguous reputation enjoyed by the
DEMI-REPS, who&s;e whole &s;y&s;tem of conduct is founded on the ba&s;is of
matrimony. Every lady therefore, inclined to indulge her&s;elf in all tho&s;e
little innocent freedoms, &s;hould confine her&s;elf within the pale of
matrimony, to elude cen&s;ure, as in&s;olvent debtors avoid a jail, by lodging
within the verge of the court.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="27">A DEMI-REP then mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be
married: nor is it ea&s;y for a lady to maintain &s;o critical a character
unle&s;s &s;he is a woman of fa&s;hion. Titles and e&s;tate bear down all weak
cen&s;ures, and &s;ilence &s;candal and detraction. That good-breeding too,
&s;o inviolably pre&s;erved among per&s;ons of condition, is of infinite
&s;ervice. This produces that de|lightful in&s;ipidity &s;o remarkable in
per&s;ons of quality, who&s;e conver&s;ation flows with one even tenor,
undi&s;turb'd by &s;en|timent, and unruffled by pa&s;&s;ion: in&s;omuch that
hu&s;bands and wives, brothers, &s;i&s;ters, cou&s;ins, and in &s;hort the
whole circle of kindred and acquaintance, can entertain the mo&s;t thorough
contempt and even hatred for each other, without tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ing the
minute&s;t article of good-breeding and civility. But tho&s;e females who want
the advantages of birth and fortune, mu&s;t be content to wrap them&s;elves up
in their in|tegrity; for the lower &s;ort are &s;o notoriou&s;ly deficient in
the requi&s;ites of politene&s;s, that they would not fail to throw out the
mo&s;t cruel and bitter invectives again&s;t the pretty delinquents.</P>
<P>THE Great World will, I doubt not, return me thanks for thus
keeping the <HI>canaille</HI> at a di&s;tance, and &s;ecuring to them a quiet
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their enjoyments. And here I cannot but ob&s;erve how
re&s;pectable an Order the DEMI-REPS compo&s;e, of which the lovely
&s;i&s;terhood mu&s;t all be married, and almo&s;t all Right Honourable.</P>
<P>FOR this Order, among many other embelli&s;hments of modern
life, we are indebted to the <HI>French:</HI> &s;uch flippant gaiety is more
agreeable to the genius of that nation. There is a native ba&s;hfulne&s;s
inherent in my countrywomen, which it is not ea&s;y to &s;urmount: but our
modern fine ladies, who take as much pains to poli&s;h their minds, as to adorn
their per&s;ons, have got over this ob&s;tacle with incredible fa|cility. 
<PB N="23" REF="28"> They have &s;o &s;killfully grafted the <HI>French</HI>
genius for intrigue upon <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> beauty and liberty, that their
conduct appears perfectly original. Though we mu&s;t do the <HI>French</HI> the
ju&s;tice to allow, that when a lady of this airy di&s;po&s;i|tion vi&s;its
<HI>Paris,</HI> &s;he returns mo&s;t wonderfully improved. Upon the whole,
<HI>France</HI> appears the propere&s;t &s;chool to in|&s;truct the ladies in
the theory of their conduct, but <HI>England,</HI> and more e&s;pecially
<HI>London,</HI> the mo&s;t commodious place to put it in practice. In this
town, indeed, a lady &s;tudious of improvement may, in a very &s;hort time,
make a con&s;ider|able proficiency by frequenting the &s;everal academies kept
con&s;tantly open for her profit and in&s;truction. The Card-tables and
Ma&s;querades in particular have trained up &s;ome ladies to a &s;urprizing
eminence without the lea&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance from a foreign education.</P>
<P>IT is ob&s;erved, that the difference between the &s;everal
&s;pecies in the &s;cale of beings is but ju&s;t &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve
their di&s;tinction; the highe&s;t of one Order approaching &s;o near to the
lowe&s;t of the other, that the gradation is hard to be determined; as the
colours of the rainbow, thro' an infinite variety of &s;hades, die away into
each other imper|ceptibly. The DEMI-REPS hold this intermediate &s;tation in
the characters of females between the mode&s;t women and the women of
plea&s;ure; to both which they are in &s;ome mea&s;ure connected, as they
&s;tand upon the utmo&s;t verge of reputation, and totter on the brink of
infamy. It were therefore to be wi&s;hed, that the Ladies wore &s;ome &s;ymbol
of their Order, or were di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;ome peculiar mode of dre&s;s.
The <HI>Romans</HI> a&s;&s;igned different habits to per&s;ons of different
ages and &s;tations; and I hope, that when the bu&s;tle of the en&s;uing
Election is over, the new Parliament will take this matter into
con&s;ideration, and oblige the &s;e|veral <PB N="24" REF="29"> cla&s;&s;es of
females to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves by &s;ome external marks and badges of
their principles.</P>
<P>'TILL &s;ome Act of this nature &s;hall take place, I &s;hall
propo&s;e a method, by which every lady may exactly learn in what cla&s;s &s;he
may be reckoned. The world mu&s;t know then, that my very good friend Mr.
AYSCOUGH has at length, with infinite pains and &s;tudy, con&s;tructed a
Ther|mometer, upon which he has delineated, after the manner that the degrees
of heat and cold are marked on the com|mon &s;ort, the whole &s;cale of female
characters, from the mo&s;t inviolable mode&s;ty to the mo&s;t abandoned
impudence. It is of a commodious &s;ize to wear at a watch: the liquor within
the tube is a chymical mixture, which being acted on by the circulation of the
blood and animal &s;pirits, will ri&s;e and fall according to the de&s;ires and
affections of the wearer. He will very &s;hortly publi&s;h a large

and I flatter my&s;elf there are many women in <HI>England,</HI> who will be
glad to purcha&s;e &s;uch an effectual regulator of their pa&s;&s;ions. Every
lady therefore may avail her&s;elf of the in&s;tructions of tills
pocket-monitor; a monitor who will give her the mo&s;t profitable le&s;&s;ons
without the u&s;ual impertinence of advice. It will be of equal efficacy if
worn by the men: but I ex|pect my friend will have but little of their
cu&s;tom; for as the reputation of cha&s;tity is the utmo&s;t aim of a fine
lady, to pre&s;erve even that in a fine gentleman is accounted mean and
unmanly.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Bat&s;on's Coffee-Hou&s;e,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>Feb.</HI> 26, 1754.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I MUST beg leave to trouble you on a mo&s;t &s;erious and
melancholy &s;ubject; a &s;ubject which I fear will be attended with the mo&s;t
dreadful con&s;equences to the whole nation. Notwith&s;tanding the la&s;t mail
brought the College po&s;itive a&s;&s;urances from the <HI>French</HI> King's
phy|&s;icians, that the late PLAGUE at <HI>Rouen</HI> was entirely cea&s;ed, I
have the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;ons to apprehend that the contagion is already
&s;pread to this city. My own practice daily fur|ni&s;hes me with lamentable
in&s;tances, that manife&s;tly indicate a pe&s;tilential di&s;order in the
blood and humours.</P>
<P>I WAS fir&s;t induced to &s;u&s;pect that &s;ome Epidemical
Di&s;temper was taking root among us, from my being called <PB N="26" REF="31">
in to a noble patient, who (as the public prints have in|form'd you) has lately
been afflicted with a violent boil on his back. From this patient there have
i&s;&s;ued continu|ally great quantities of corruption of a yellow hue. His
complaint &s;eems to be in &s;ome &s;ort con&s;titutional, as it com|monly
breaks out with extraordinary virulence every &s;even year; and as this is the
cri&s;is, we cannot pronounce our noble patient out of danger, 'till he has got
over the en&s;uing &s;pring. It is moreover to be feared, that the contagion
has likewi&s;e reached <HI>Ireland</HI>; where we hear that the be&s;t
phy|&s;icians are u&s;ing the mo&s;t forcing medicines, and are of opinion that
nothing can relieve the unhappy people, 'till they have <HI>voided a</HI>
STONE. A great man there labours al&s;o under the abovementioned complaint of
having a <HI>violent</HI> BOYLE <HI>on his back.</HI></P>
<P>I SHALL now proceed to give you the hi&s;tory of &s;ome other
ca&s;es, which have fallen under my notice, and are to me an indi&s;putable
proof that the PLAGUE has got footing among us. It's malignancy &s;hews
it&s;elf particularly about the Court; and we are a&s;&s;ured that &s;ome parts
of the Country are al&s;o tainted with it. I have had the honour to attend
&s;everal Members of Parliament, who&s;e ca&s;es are very de&s;|perate. Some I
found in a declining way, given over by all their friends; others are &s;o
weak, that they can't &s;tand alone; and many are &s;o re&s;tle&s;s, that they
are continually turning from &s;ide to &s;ide. As I found they had great need
of &s;upport, I have advi&s;ed them to drink plentifully of &s;trong liquors,
and guard again&s;t the ill con&s;equences of a <HI>Return.</HI></P>
<P>I VISITED the other day a young gentleman, who has lately been
promoted to a command in the &s;quadron de&s;igned for the <HI>Ea&s;t
Indies.</HI> I found him in a mo&s;t langui&s;hing con|dition, his &s;pirits
were quite depre&s;s'd, he had a violent palpitation of the heart, and the
whole nervous &s;y&s;tem was relax'd. I would have pre&s;cribed the well-known
diet-drink brought into practice by the late Bi&s;hop of <HI>Cloyne</HI>; but
he told me every thing went again&s;t his <PB N="27" REF="32"> &s;tomach that
favoured of <HI>Tar.</HI> However, I at length pre|vailed on him to &s;ubmit to
a long cour&s;e of Sea Water. I have ob&s;erv'd the &s;ame progno&s;tics in
&s;ome of our land officers; to whom I have recommended the frequent u&s;e of
Exerci&s;e, together with a cour&s;e of Steel, and a Powder compo&s;ed of Nitre
and Brim&s;tone.</P>
<P>A FRIEND of mine, one of the common-council men of this city,
is infected to a &s;trong degree with the pre&s;ent pe&s;tilence. His chief
complaint is a <HI>canine</HI> appetite, and his wife a&s;&s;ures me &s;he has
often felt the wolf in his belly. The cau&s;e of this di&s;temper is originally
in the palate, and di&s;covers it&s;elf by a watering of the mouth from the
&s;alival glands, and a grinding of the teeth as in the action of
ma&s;tication. This di&s;order being very common in the city, and likely to
&s;pread among the Livery, I have directed him to <HI>perform Quarentine</HI>
by ab&s;taining from fle&s;h during the pre&s;ent Lent.</P>
<P>I KNOW another, a very worthy alderman, who now lies in a
mo&s;t deplorable condition. He is &s;welled to a mo&s;t enormous &s;ize; his
whole face, and particularly his no&s;e, is cru&s;ted over with fiery
pu&s;tules of the confluent kind. He is afflicted with an in&s;atiable
thir&s;t, and is very &s;ubject to <HI>epileptic</HI> fits. I was &s;ent for
la&s;t night, when one of the&s;e fits was very &s;trong upon him. He lay, to
all appearance, dead on the floor, wallowing in the mid&s;t of a fetid ma&s;s,
partly &s;olid, partly fluid, which had i&s;&s;ued from his mouth and
no&s;trils with repeated eructations. I would immediately have admini&s;tred to
him a proper do&s;e of <HI>aq. font. tepefact.</HI> but on offering him the
draught he &s;hew'd the &s;tronge&s;t &s;ymptoms of a confirmed
<HI>Hydrophobia.</HI></P>
<P>I WENT out of charity to &s;ee a poor tragic author (no
reflection upon any of the profe&s;&s;ion, Mr. TOWN) who has been obliged to
keep his room all the winter, and is dying by inches of an inveterate
<HI>Atrophy.</HI> By his extravagant ra|vings, &s;udden &s;tarts, incoherent
expre&s;&s;ions, and pa&s;&s;ionate <PB N="28" REF="33"> exclamations, I judged
his di&s;order to be &s;eated in the brain, and therefore directed his head to
be bli&s;ter'd all over. I cured another, a comic author, of a lethargy, by
making a revul&s;ion of the bad humour from the part affected with
&s;timulating cathartics. A &s;hort &s;quabby gentleman of a gro&s;s and
corpulent make was &s;eiz'd with a kind of St. <HI>Vitus</HI>'s Dance, as he
was practi&s;ing Harlequin for the ma&s;querade: his whole body was convul&s;ed
with the mo&s;t violent writh|ings, and irregular twitches; but I pre&s;ently
removed his complaint by bleeding him in the foot.</P>
<P>THE PLAGUE, as I ob&s;erved before, puts on different
appearances in different &s;ubjects. A per&s;on of quality, one of the club at
<HI>White</HI>'s, was &s;eiz'd with the epidemical phrenzy raging there, which
propagates it&s;elf by certain black and red &s;pots. He had &s;uffered &s;o
much lo&s;s by con|tinual evacuations, that his whole &s;ub&s;tance was
wa&s;ted; and when I &s;aw him he was &s;o reduc'd, that there were no hopes of
a recovery. Another nobleman caught the infec|tion at <HI>Newmarket,</HI> which
brought upon him &s;uch a <HI>running,</HI> that he is now in the la&s;t
&s;tage of a <HI>galloping</HI> con&s;umption. A reverend divine, lately made a
dignitary of the church, has unhappily lo&s;t his memory, and is &s;o blind
withal, that he hardly knows any of his old acquaintance: the mu&s;cles of his
face are all contracted into an au&s;tere frown, his knees are &s;tiff and
inflexible, and he is unable, poor gentleman! to bend his body, or move his
hand to his head. I have ob&s;erv'd others &s;eiz'd at times with a &s;trange
kind of deaf|ne&s;s; and at certain intervals I have found them &s;o
prodigiou&s;ly hard of hearing, that tho' a trade&s;man has bawled ever &s;o
loudly in their ears, it has had no effect upon them.</P>
<P>BY what means this PLAGUE has been introduc'd among us, cannot
ea&s;ily be a&s;certained;&mdash;whether it was imported in the &s;ame band-box
with the la&s;t new head, or was &s;ecretly convey'd in the plaits of an
embroider'd &s;uit:&mdash;but that it came over hither from <HI>France,</HI>
plainly appears from the manner in which it affects our people of fa&s;hion,
(e&s;pecially <PB N="29" REF="34"> the ladies) who bear about them the mo&s;t
evident marks of the <HI>French Di&s;ea&s;e.</HI> This is known to affect the
whole <HI>habit of body,</HI> and extends it's influence from head to foot. But
it's &s;tronge&s;t attacks are levell'd at the face; and it has &s;uch an
effect upon the complexion, that it entirely changes the natural colour of the
&s;kin. At <HI>Paris</HI> the face of every lady you meet is be&s;mear'd with
unguent, ceru&s;s, and plai&s;ter; and I have lately remarked with infinite
con|cern the native charms of my pretty countrywomen de|&s;troyed by the &s;ame
cau&s;e. In this ca&s;e I have always pro|po&s;ed calling in the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a &s;urgeon to pare off this un|natural <HI>Epidermis</HI>
or Scarf-&s;kin, occa&s;ion'd by the ignorance of Empirics in the immoderate
application of <HI>Alteratives.</HI></P>
<P>FROM what I have been able to collect from ob&s;ervations on
my female patients, I have found little variation in the ef|fects of the PLAGUE
on that &s;ex. Mo&s;t of them complain of a la&s;&s;itude, a
li&s;tle&s;sne&s;s, an unea&s;ine&s;s, pains they don't know where, vapours,
hy&s;terics, want of re&s;t, want of &s;pi|rits, and lo&s;s of appetite:
con&s;equently the &s;ame regimen may &s;erve for all. I advi&s;e them to u&s;e
a great deal of exerci&s;e in driving about the town, to dilute properly with
tea, to per&s;pire freely at public places, and in their &s;ea&s;ons to go to
<HI>Bath, Tunbridge, Cheltenham,</HI> or <HI>Scarborough.</HI></P>
<P>I WAS indeed &s;urpriz'd with an extraordinary new ca&s;e the
other night, when I was called out of bed to attend a Maid of Honour, who is
frequently afflicted with fits of the mother. Her abdomen I found, upon
examination, to be preternaturally di&s;tended: the tumour has been gradually
increa&s;ing; but I would not attempt to di&s;cu&s;s it, as it was not yet
arrived at maturity. I intend &s;oon to remove her into the country for a
month, in order to deliver her from the complaint &s;he labours under.</P>
<P>I HAVE been induced, &s;ir, to write to you on this
oc|ca&s;ion, as you are pleas'd to take this city under your im|mediate care.
So alarming an evil calls upon us all to <PB N="30" REF="35"> oppo&s;e it's
progre&s;s; for my own part, nothing &s;hall deter me from a diligent
di&s;charge of the duty of my profe&s;&s;ion, tho' it has already expo&s;ed me
to the greate&s;t dangers in the execution of it. An old captain of a man of
war, who is grievou&s;ly troubled with the <HI>cholera morbus,</HI> and
overflowing of the gall, on my only hinting a Cly&s;ter &s;wore vehemently that
I &s;hould take one my&s;elf, and applying his foot di|rectly to my fundament,
kick'd me down &s;tairs. This very morning I e&s;caped almo&s;t by miracle from
the contagion, which raged in the mo&s;t violent degree through a whole family.
The ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s are both of them in a very high fever, and quite
frantic and delirious: their tongues were prodigiou&s;ly inflamed, the tip very
&s;harp, and perpe|tually vibrating without the lea&s;t intermi&s;&s;ion. I
would have pre&s;cribed &s;ome cooling and lenitive medicines, but the
hu&s;|band in the height of his frenzy flung my wig into the fire, and his wife
&s;luiced me with extrava&s;ated urine. As I retired with precipitation, I
heard the &s;ame wild ravings from the nur&s;ery, the kitchen, and every other
quarter, which convin|ced me that the pe&s;tilence had &s;eiz'd the whole
hou&s;e. I ran out of doors as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, reflecting with Terence,

<Q> 
<L>&mdash;Ip&s;a &s;i cupiat Salus,</L> 
<L>Servar&eacute; prors&ugrave;s non pote&s;t hanc
familiam.</L></Q></P>
<P>UPON the whole, I may conclude with the Aphori&s;m of
<HI>Hippocrates</HI>; that 
<Q REND="inline">"no people can po&s;&s;ibly be afflicted with
&s;o many and &s;o terrible di&s;orders, unle&s;s the PLAGUE is among
them."</Q></P>

<P>_I REMEMBER to have &s;een in &s;ome old <HI>Italian</HI> Poet a
fable call'd "The Education of the Mu&s;es." <HI>Apollo</HI> is there &s;aid to
have taken them at their birth under his immediate care, and as they grew up to
have in&s;tructed them according to their different capacities in the &s;everal
branches of playing and &s;inging. <HI>Thalia,</HI> we are told, was of a
lively turn, and took delight in the mo&s;t comic airs; but was at fir&s;t with
difficulty re&s;trained from falling into ridiculous drolleries, and what our
author calls <HI>extravaganzas</HI> in her manner. <HI>Melpomene,</HI> who was
of a &s;erious and grave di&s;po&s;ition, indulged her&s;elf in &s;trains of
melancholy; but when &s;he aimed at the mo&s;t pathetic &s;trokes, was often
har&s;h, or run into wild divi&s;ions. <HI>Clio,</HI> and the re&s;t of the
Nine, had not yet learnt to temper their voices with &s;weet|ne&s;s 
<PB N="32" REF="37"> and variety; nor could they tell how to regulate the
&s;tops of their flutes, or touch the &s;trings of their lyres, with judgment
and grace. However, by much practice, they improved gradually under the
in&s;tructions of <HI>Apollo,</HI> 'till at la&s;t they were able to exert all
the powers of mu&s;ic: and they now form a compleat concert, which fills all
<HI>Parna&s;&s;us</HI> with the mo&s;t enchanting harmony.</P>
<P>THE moral to be drawn from this little fable is naturally
ap|plied to tho&s;e &s;ervants of the Mu&s;es, Authors, who mu&s;t
ne|ce&s;&s;arily ri&s;e by the &s;ame &s;low degrees from their fir&s;t lame
attempts in cultivating the arts of <HI>Apollo.</HI> The be&s;t of them,
without doubt, went through many more &s;tages of writing than appears from the
palpable gradations &s;till remaining in their works. But as it is
impo&s;&s;ible to trace them from their fir&s;t &s;etting out, I &s;hall here
pre&s;ent the reader with the &s;um of my own experience, and illu&s;trate in
the life of Mr. TOWN, the Progre&s;s of an Author.</P>
<P>RIGHT or wrong, I have ever been addicted to &s;cribbling. I was
famous at &s;chool for my readine&s;s at Crambo and capping ver&s;es: I often
made themes for other boys, and &s;old my copy for a tart or a cu&s;tard: at
nine years old I was taken notice of for an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Di&s;tich, and
afterwards immor|talized my&s;elf by an Holyday's Ta&s;k in the &s;ame
language, which my ma&s;ter, who was him&s;elf a poet, pronounc'd to be
&s;carce inferior to his favourite <HI>Blackmore.</HI> The&s;e were fol|lowed
by a multitude of little pieces, that, like other fruits which come before
their proper &s;ea&s;on, had nothing to re|commend them but their early
appearance.</P>
<P>FILLED however with great conceptions of my genius and
importance, I could not but lament that &s;uch extraor|dinary parts &s;hould be
confined within the narrow circle of <PB N="33" REF="38"> my relations and
acquaintance. Therefore, in order to oblige and amaze the public, I &s;oon
became a very large contributor to the Monthly Magazines. But I had the
un|&s;peakable mortification to &s;ee my favours &s;ometimes not in&s;erted,
often po&s;tponed, often much altered, and you may be &s;ure for the wor&s;e.
On all the&s;e occa&s;ions I never failed to condemn the arrogance and folly of
the compilers of the&s;e mi&s;cellanies, wondering how they could &s;o
gro&s;sly mi|&s;take their own intere&s;t, and neglect the entertainment of
their readers.</P>
<P>IN the mean time a maiden aunt with whom I lived, a very pious
old lady, turned Methodi&s;t, and often took me with her to the Tabernacle, the
Foundery, and many private meetings. This made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon my
mind, that I devoted my&s;elf entirely to &s;acred &s;ubjects, and wrote
&s;everal Hymns, which were received with infinite applau&s;e by all the good
women who vi&s;ited my aunt; and (the &s;er|vants being al&s;o Methodi&s;ts)
they were often &s;ung by the whole family in the kitchen. I might perhaps in
time have rivalled <HI>We&s;ley</HI> in the&s;e divine compo&s;itions, and had
even be|gun an entire new ver&s;ion of the P&s;alms, when my aunt, changing her
religion a &s;econd time, became a Moravian. But the Hymns u&s;ually &s;ung by
the United Brethren contain &s;entiments &s;o &s;ublime and &s;o
incomprehen&s;ible, that not|with&s;tanding my late &s;ucce&s;s in that kind of
poetry, and the great opinion I entertained of my own talents, I dur&s;t not
venture on their &s;tile and manner.</P>
<P>AS Love and Poetry mutually produce each other, it is no wonder
that before I was &s;eventeen I had &s;ingled out my particular
<HI>Sachari&s;&s;a.</HI> This, you may &s;uppo&s;e, gave birth to innumerable
Songs, Elegies, and Acro&s;tics. In the &s;pace of two years I had written more
love-ver&s;es than <PB N="34" REF="39"> <HI>Waller</HI> or any other poet;
when, ju&s;t as I imagined I had ryhmed my&s;elf into her good graces, I had
the mortification to find that my mi&s;tre&s;s was married to a Cornet of
Hor&s;e, a fellow who, I am &s;ure, never wrote a line in his life. This threw
me into &s;uch a violent rage again&s;t the whole &s;ex, that I immediately
burnt every &s;yllable I had written in her prai&s;e, and in bitterne&s;s of
&s;oul tran&s;lated the &s;ixth Satire of <HI>Juvenal.</HI></P>
<P>SOON after this the &s;on and heir of Lord <HI>Townly,</HI> (to
whom I have the honour of being a di&s;tant relation) was in a treaty of
marriage with a rich heire&s;s. I &s;at down im|mediately with great
compo&s;ure to write an Epithalamium on this occa&s;ion. I trimm'd
<HI>Hymen</HI>'s torch, and invited the <HI>Loves</HI> and <HI>Graces</HI> to
the wedding: <HI>Concord</HI> was prepared to join their hands, and
<HI>Juno</HI> to ble&s;s them with a numerous race of children. After all
the&s;e pains, when every thing was ready for the wedding, and the la&s;t hand
put to the Epithalamium, the match was &s;uddenly broke off, and my poem of
cour&s;e rendered u&s;ele&s;s. I was more unea&s;y under this di&s;appointment
than any of the parties could po&s;&s;ibly be; 'till I was informed of the
&s;udden marriage of a noble lord with a celebrated beauty. On this popular
occa&s;ion, promi&s;ing my&s;elf univer&s;al applau&s;e, I immediately
publi&s;hed my Epi|thalamium; which, like <HI>Bayes</HI>'s Prologue, was
artfully contrived to &s;erve one purpo&s;e as well as another.</P>
<P>AS my notions had been hitherto confined within a narrow
&s;phere of life, my literary pur&s;uits were con&s;equently le&s;s important,
'till I had the opportunity of enlarging my ideas by going abroad. My travels,
of which I have before hinted &s;omething to the reader, opened to me a new and
exten&s;ive field for ob&s;ervation. I will not pre&s;ume to boa&s;t, that I
received any part of my education at <HI>Geneva,</HI> or any of tho&s;e 
<PB N="35" REF="40"> celebrated foreign Univer&s;ities, in which alone an
ENGLISH|MAN can be grounded in the principles of religion and
liberty:&mdash;but I may &s;ay without vanity that I gleaned &s;ome u&s;eful
knowledge from every place I vi&s;ited. My propen&s;ity to writing followed me
wherever I went; and were I to meet with encouragement by a large
&s;ub&s;cription, I could publi&s;h &s;everal volumes of curious remarks which
I made in my tour. I had indeed like to have got into &s;ome unlucky &s;crapes,
by turning author in places where the liberty of the pre&s;s was never &s;o
much as heard of. At <HI>Paris</HI> I narrowly e&s;caped being put into the
<HI>Ba&s;tile</HI> for a little <HI>Chan&s;on &agrave; boire</HI> reflecting on
the Mi&s;tre&s;s of the <HI>Grand Monarque</HI>; and I was obliged to quit
<HI>Rome</HI> a week &s;ooner than I intended, for fixing on <HI>Pa&s;quin</HI>
a Prayer for the Pope's Toe, which was then laid up with the gout.</P>
<P>IT was not 'till my return from abroad, that I formally
commenc'd a profe&s;&s;ed Critic, for which I now thought my&s;elf thoroughly
qualified. I could draw parallels between <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> and
<HI>Denoyer,</HI> compare the behaviour of the <HI>French</HI> Parterre with
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pit, and have lately made a figure by affecting an
indifference about the pre&s;ent Burlettas, as I took care to let every body
know that I had often &s;een them in <HI>Flanders.</HI> My knowledge in
theatrical affairs naturally led me to write a great number of occa&s;ional
pamphlets on tho&s;e topics, &s;uch as "Examens of New Plays, Letters to the
Managers," &amp;c. Not content with this, I had a &s;trong inclination to
&s;hine in the Drama. I often plea&s;ed my&s;elf with computing&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">"three benefit nights&mdash;let me
&s;ee&mdash;&s;ix hundred pounds at lea&s;t&mdash;an hundred more for the
copy&mdash;be&s;ides a perpetual freedom of the Hou&s;e."</Q>&mdash;The&s;e
were temptations not to be re&s;i&s;ted. I &s;at down therefore to a Tragedy;
but before I got through the fir&s;t act, de|&s;pairing to make it
&s;ufficiently <HI>pathetic</HI> for the modern ta&s;te, <PB N="36" REF="41"> I
chang'd my &s;cheme, and began a Comedy: then again reflecting that mo&s;t of
our Comedies were in reality nothing but overgrown Farces, contented my&s;elf
with writing what authors are now plea&s;ed to call a Comedy of two Acts. This
I fini&s;hed with a great deal of pains, and very much to my own
&s;atisfaction: but not being able to get it on the &s;tage, as one hou&s;e was
entirely taken up with Pantomimes, and the Manager of the other had &s;o many
Farces of his own, I generou&s;ly made a pre&s;ent of it to an actor for his
benefit;&mdash;when to my great &s;urprize it was damn'd.</P>
<P>I HAVE at la&s;t re&s;olv'd to bend all my attention, and
em|ploy all my powers, in the carrying on this my pre&s;ent ela|borate
undertaking. I am &s;orry to own that the &s;ucce&s;s has not at all an&s;wer'd
my expectations: I flatter'd my&s;elf with being univer&s;ally known, read, and
admir'd; but I find quite the contrary. I went into a coffee-hou&s;e the other
day by White-chapel Mount, where on a&s;king for the CONNOISSEUR the woman
&s;tared at me, and &s;aid &s;he did not know what I meant. I dined la&s;t week
at a foreign amba&s;&s;ador's, and not a word about me or my works pa&s;&s;ed
at table. I wrote to a relation at <HI>Caermarthen,</HI> de&s;iring to know
what reputation my paper has in Wales; but he tells me that nothing in the
li|terary way comes down there but the <HI>King's Speech</HI> and the
<HI>London Evening Po&s;t.</HI> I have enquired into the &s;ale of my fir&s;t
number, my &s;econd, my third, my fourth, and the la&s;t; yet I cannot
a&s;&s;ure my readers that I have &s;old three thou&s;and of any one of them.
In &s;hort, I give this public notice once for all, that if I don't find
my&s;elf taken in all over <HI>England</HI> by the time I have publi&s;hed two
or three hundred papers,&mdash;let them look to it&mdash;let them look to
it&mdash;I'll bid adieu to my ungrateful country, go directly to
<HI>Berlin,</HI> and (as <HI>Voltaire</HI> is di&s;carded) employ my pen in the

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I SHALL make no apology for recommending to your notice as
CENSOR GENERAL, a fault which is too common among married people. Love is
indeed a very rare ingredient in modern wedlock, nor can the 
<PB N="38" REF="43"> parties entertain too much affection for each other; but
an open di&s;play of it on all occa&s;ions renders them ri|diculous.</P>
<P>A FEW days ago I was introduced to a young couple, who were
but lately married, and are reckoned by all their acquaintance to be exceeding
happy in each other. I had &s;carce &s;aluted the bride, when the hu&s;band
caught her eagerly in his arms, and almo&s;t devoured her with ki&s;&s;es. When
we were &s;eated, they took care to place them&s;elves clo&s;e to each other,
and during our conver|&s;ation he was piddling with her fingers, tapping her
cheek, or playing with her hair. At dinner they were mutually employed in
pre&s;&s;ing each other to ta&s;te of every di&s;h, and the fond appellations
of 
<Q REND="inline">"my dear, my love, &amp;c."</Q> were
continually bandied acro&s;s the table. Soon after the cloth was removed, the
lady made a motion to re|tire, but the hu&s;band prevented the compliments of
the re&s;t of the company by &s;aying, 
<Q REND="inline">"We &s;hould be unhappy without her."</Q> As
the bottle went round he join'd her health to every toa&s;t, and could not help
now and then ri&s;ing from his chair to pre&s;s her hand, and mani|fe&s;t the
warmth of his pa&s;&s;ion by the ardour of his ca|re&s;&s;es. This precious
fooling, though it highly enter|tained them, gave me great di&s;gu&s;t,
therefore, as my com|pany might very well be &s;pared, I took my leave as
&s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>THIS behaviour, though at all times improper, may in &s;ome
&s;ort be excu&s;ed, where perhaps the match has been huddled up by the
parents, and the young people are &s;uch new acquaintance, that they &s;carce
ever &s;aw each other 'till their marriage. A pair of loving turtles may be
indulged in a little amorous billing at their fir&s;t coming 
<PB N="39" REF="44"> together, but this licence &s;hould expire with the
Honey-moon, and even in that period be u&s;ed but &s;paringly.</P>
<P>NOTHING is more common than to &s;ee a new-married couple
&s;etting out with a &s;plendor in their equipage, fur|niture, and manner of
living, which they have been after|wards obliged to retrench: thus it happens
when they have made them&s;elves remarkable by a &s;how of exce&s;&s;ive love.
They begin with great <HI>eclat,</HI> are lavi&s;h of their fondne&s;s at
fir&s;t, but their whole &s;tock is &s;oon wa&s;ted, and their poverty is the
more in&s;upportable, as their former profu&s;ion has made it more
con&s;picuous. I have remark|ed the ill con&s;equence of this indi&s;cretion in
both ca&s;es: one couple has at la&s;t had &s;eparate beds, while the other
have been carried to the Opera in hackney chairs.</P>
<P>TWO people, who are to pa&s;s their whole lives toge|ther, may
&s;urely find time enough for dalliance without playing over their pretty
tricks in public. How ridicu|lous would it appear, if in a large a&s;&s;embly
every one &s;hould &s;elect his mate, and the whole company &s;hould fall into
couples, like the birds on St. <HI>Valentine's Day!</HI> It is equally ab&s;urd
to &s;ee a man and his wife eternally tri|fling and toying together, 
<Q> 
<L>Still amorous, and fond, and billing,</L> 
<L>Like <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>Mary</HI> on a
&s;hilling.</L> 
<BIBL>HUDIB.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>I HAVE often been reduced to a kind of aukward di&s;tre&s;s on
the&s;e occa&s;ions, not knowing which way to look, or what to &s;ay. I
con&s;ider them as playing a game in which the &s;tander-by is not at all
intere&s;ted, and would there|fore <PB N="40" REF="45"> recommend it to every
third per&s;on in the&s;e circum|&s;tances to take it as a hint that the
parties have a mind to be alone, and leave the room without further
ceremony.</P>
<P>A FRIEND of mine happened to be engaged in a vi&s;it to one of
the&s;e loving couples. He &s;at &s;till for &s;ome time with|out interrupting
the little endearments that pa&s;&s;ed between them. Finding them at length
quite lo&s;t in Nods, Whi&s;|pers, Ogles, and in &s;hort wholly taken up with
each other, he rang the bell, and de&s;ired the &s;ervant to &s;end in my
lady's woman. When &s;he came, he led her very gravely to the &s;ettee, and
began to indulge him&s;elf in certain free|doms, which provoked the dam&s;el to
complain loudly of his rudene&s;s. The lady flew into a violent pa&s;&s;ion,
and rated him &s;everely for his mon&s;trous behaviour. My friend beg|ged her
pardon with great politene&s;s, hoped &s;he was not offended, for that he
thought there had been no harm in amu&s;ing him&s;elf a little while with Mrs.
<HI>Betty,</HI> in the &s;ame manner as Her Lady&s;hip and Sir <HI>John</HI>
had been amu&s;ing them&s;elves the&s;e two hours.</P>
<P>BUT if this conduct is blameable in young people, how very
ab&s;urd is it in tho&s;e advanced in years! Who can help laughing when he
&s;ees a worn-out Beau and Belle practi&s;ing at three&s;core the very follies
that are ridiculous at &s;ixteen? I could wi&s;h that &s;uch a pair of
antiquated lovers were de|lineated by the pencil of a Hogarth. How
humourou&s;ly would he repre&s;ent two emaciated wrinkled figures, with eyes
&s;unk into their heads, lank cheeks, and toothle&s;s gums, affecting to leer,
&s;mile, and langui&s;h at each other! But this affectation is &s;till more
remarkable, when a liquori&s;h old fool is continually fondling a young wife:
though perhaps the &s;ight is not &s;o di&s;gu&s;ting to a &s;tranger, who may
rea&s;onably <PB N="41" REF="46"> &s;uppo&s;e it to be the overflowings of a
father's tenderne&s;s for his daughter.</P>
<P>IT &s;ometimes happens that one of them perceives the folly of
this behaviour. I have &s;een a &s;en&s;ible man quite unea&s;y at the
indi&s;creet marks of kindne&s;s &s;hewn by his lady. I know a clergyman in the
country, who is often put to the blu&s;h by the &s;trange familiarities, which
his wife's love induces her to take with him. As &s;he has had but an
indifferent education, you would often be at a lo&s;s to know whether &s;he is
very kind, or very rude. If he dines abroad, &s;he always &s;ees him get on
hor&s;eback, and before he has got twenty yards from the door, hollows after
him, 
<Q REND="inline">"be at home in time, my dear dog, do."</Q> I
have known her almo&s;t quarrel with him for not buttoning his coat in the
middle of Summer, and &s;he once had the good nature to burn a very valuable
collection of <HI>Greek</HI> Manu&s;cripts, le&s;t the poring over tho&s;e
horrid crooked letters &s;hould put her dear <HI>Jack</HI>'s eyes out. Thus
does &s;he tor|ment the poor par&s;on with her violent affection for him, and
according to the common phra&s;e, kills him with kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>I WOULD recommend it to all married people, but e&s;peci|ally
to the ladies, not to be &s;o &s;weet upon their dears before company. But I
would not be under&s;tood to countenance that coldne&s;s and indifference,
which is &s;o fa&s;hionable in the polite world. Nothing is accounted more
ungenteel than for a hu&s;band and wife to be &s;een together in public places;
and if they &s;hould ever accidentally meet, they take no more notice of each
other, than if they were ab&s;olute &s;trangers. The gentleman may lavi&s;h as
much gallantry as he plea&s;es on other women, and the lady give encouragement
to twenty pretty fellows without cen&s;ure; <PB N="42" REF="47"> but they would
either of them blu&s;h at being &s;urprized in &s;hewing the lea&s;t marks of a
regard for each other.</P>
<P>BEFORE I conclude I cannot but take notice of tho&s;e
lu&s;cious love-&s;cenes, that have &s;o great a &s;hare in our mo|dern plays;
which are rendered &s;till more ful&s;om by the officiou&s;ne&s;s of the
player, who takes every opportunity of heightening the expre&s;&s;ion by
ki&s;&s;es and embraces. In a Comedy, nothing is more reli&s;hed by the
audience than a loud &s;mack which echoes through the whole hou&s;e, and in the
mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate &s;cenes of a Tragedy, the Hero and Heroine are
continually flying into each others arms. For my part I am never pre&s;ent at a
&s;cene of this kind, which produces a con&s;cious &s;imper from the Boxes, and
a hearty chuckle of applau&s;e from the Pit and Galleries, but I am ready to
exclaim with old <HI>Renault</HI>&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">"I like not the&s;e huggers."</Q></P>

<DIV2 TYPE="body of issue">
<P>_I MUST acknowledge the receipt of many letters containing very
lavi&s;h encomiums on my works. Among the re&s;t a corre&s;pon|dent, whom I
take to be a Book&s;eller, is plea&s;ed to compliment me on the goodne&s;s of
my print and paper, but tells me that he is very &s;orry not to &s;ee
&s;omething expre&s;&s;ive of my undertaking in the little cut that I carry in
front. It is true, indeed, that my printer and publi&s;her held &s;everal
con&s;ultations on this &s;ubject; and I am a&s;hamed to confe&s;s that they
had once prevailed on me to &s;uffer a profile of my face to be prefixed to
each number. But when it was fini&s;hed, I was quite mortified to &s;ee what a
&s;curvy figure I made in wood: nor could I &s;ubmit to be hung out, like
<HI>Broughton,</HI> at my own <PB N="44" REF="49"> door, or let my face
&s;erve, like the canva&s;s before a booth, to call people in to the
&s;how.</P>
<P>I HOPE it will not be imputed to envy or malevolence, that I
here remark on this part of the productions of Mr. <HI>Fitz-Adam.</HI> When he
gave his paper the title of <HI>The</HI> WORLD, I &s;uppo&s;e he meant to
intimate his de|&s;ign of de&s;cribing that part of it, who are known to
ac|count all other per&s;ons No Body, and are therefore empha|tically call'd
<HI>The</HI> WORLD. if this was to be pictured out in the head-piece, a lady at
her toilette, a party at whi&s;t, or the jovial member of the
<HI>Dilettanti</HI> tapping the world for champagne, had been the mo&s;t
natural and obvious hieroglyphics. But when we &s;ee the portrait of a
philo&s;o|pher poring on the globe, in&s;tead of ob&s;ervations on modern life
we might more naturally expect a &s;y&s;tem of geography, or an attempt towards
a di&s;covery of the longitude.</P>
<P>THE reader will &s;mile perhaps at a critici&s;m of this kind;
yet certainly even here propriety &s;hould be ob&s;erved, or at lea&s;t all
ab&s;urdities avoided: but this matter being u&s;ually left to the printer or
book&s;eller, it is often attended with &s;trange blunders and
mi&s;-applications. I have &s;een a Sermon u&s;hered in with the
repre&s;entation of a &s;hepherd and &s;hep|herde&s;s &s;porting on a bank of
flowers, with two little Cupids &s;miling over head; while perhaps an
Epithalamium or an Ode for a Birth-day has been introduced with death's heads
and cro&s;s-marrow-bones.</P>
<P>THE inhabitants of <HI>Grub&s;treet</HI> are generally very
&s;tudious of propriety in this point. Before the half-penny account of an
hor&s;e-race, we &s;ee the jockeys whipping, &s;purring, jo&s;tling, and the
hor&s;es &s;training within &s;ight of the po&s;t. The la&s;t dying &s;peech,
character, and behaviour of the <PB N="45" REF="50"> malefactors pre&s;ents us
with a pro&s;pect of the place of execution; and the hi&s;tory of the London
Prentice exhibits the figure of a lad &s;tanding between two lions, and
ram|ming his hands down their throats. A due regard has been paid to this
article in the &s;everal elegies from that quarter on the death of Mr.
<HI>Pelham.</HI> They are encom|pa&s;&s;ed with di&s;mal black lines, and all
the &s;able emblems of death; nor can we doubt but that an author, who takes
&s;uch care to expre&s;s a decent &s;orrow on the out&s;ide of his work, has
infu&s;ed a great deal of the pathetic into the piece it&s;elf.</P>
<P>THESE little embelli&s;hments were originally de&s;igned to
plea&s;e the eye of the reader, as we tempt children to learn their letters by
di&s;po&s;ing the alphabet into pictures. But in our modern compo&s;itions,
they are not only ornamental but u&s;eful. An angel or a flowerpot, at the
beginning and end of every chapter or &s;ection, enables the book&s;eller to
&s;pin out a novel, without plot or incident, to a great number of volumes; and
by the help of the&s;e decorations properly di&s;po&s;ed I have known a little
piece &s;well into a duodecimo, which had &s;carce matter enough for a
&s;ix-penny pamphlet.</P>
<P>IN this place I might al&s;o take notice of the &s;everal new
improvements in the bu&s;ine&s;s of Typography. Though it is reckoned ungenteel
to write a good hand, yet every one is proud of appearing in a beautiful print;
and the pro|ductions of a man of quality come from the pre&s;s in a very neat
letter, though perhaps the Manu&s;cript is hardly legible. Indeed, our modern
writers &s;eem to be more &s;ollicitous a|bout outward elegance than the
intrin&s;ic merit of their compo&s;itions; and on this account it is thought no
mean recommendation of their works, to adverti&s;e that they are neatly printed
on an entire new letter. Nor are they only <PB N="46" REF="51"> indebted to the
pre&s;s for the beauty of the type, but often call in it's a&s;&s;i&s;tance to
explain and enforce the &s;entiment. When an author is in doubt whether the
reader will be able to comprehend his meaning, or indeed whether he has any
meaning at all, he takes care to &s;prinkle the &s;en|tence with
<HI>Italicks:</HI> but when he would &s;urprize us with any thing more
&s;triking than ordinary, he di&s;tingui&s;hes the emphatical words by large
&s;taring CAPITALS, which overtop the re&s;t of their fellows, and are
intended, like the grenadiers caps, to give us an idea of &s;omething grand and
uncommon. The&s;e are de&s;igned as &s;o many hints to let the reader know
where he is to be particularly affected, and an&s;wer the &s;ame purpo&s;e with
the marginal direc|tions in plays, which inform the actor when he is to laugh
or cry.</P>
<P>THIS practice is mo&s;t remarkable in pieces of modern wit and
humour; and it may be ob&s;erved that where there is the lea&s;t of the&s;e
lively qualities, the author is mo&s;t de|&s;irous of &s;ub&s;tituting the&s;e
arts in their room; imagining that by a judicious di&s;tribution of the&s;e
enlivening &s;trokes in different parts of it, his work, however dull in
it&s;elf, will become &s;mart and brilliant. But it mu&s;t not be
di&s;&s;embled that the hint was originally taken from the Theatres. The writer
of the play-bills deals out his capitals in &s;o ju&s;t a proportion, that you
may tell the &s;alary of each actor by the &s;ize of the letter in which his
name is printed. When the pre&s;ent manager of <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> fir&s;t came
upon the &s;tage, a new &s;et of types two inches long were ca&s;t on purpo&s;e
to do ju&s;tice to his extraordinary merit. This is &s;o proper that the
&s;evere&s;t critics on the Drama cannot be offended at this piece of
theatrical ju&s;tice.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="52">THERE is lately &s;prung up among us a new
&s;pecies of writers, who are mo&s;t of them per&s;ons of the fir&s;t rank and
fa&s;hion. At this period the whole Hou&s;e of Commons are turned authors; and
we cannot &s;ufficiently admire the pro|priety of &s;tile and &s;entiment in
tho&s;e elegant addre&s;&s;es, by which they humbly offer them&s;elves as
candidates, and beg the favour of your votes and intere&s;t. The&s;e gentlemen
avail them&s;elves greatly of the arts of printing abovemen|tioned; whether
they would rai&s;e the merits of their own cau&s;e, or throw out invectives on
the oppo&s;ite party. The Courtier &s;ets before your eyes his &s;teady
attachment to King GEORGE, while his opponent di&s;plays in the &s;ame manner
his zeal for LIBERTY and the CONSTI|TUTION. This mu&s;t undoubtedly have a
wonderful effect on the electors; and I could a&s;&s;ure any patriot the mo&s;t
certain &s;ucce&s;s, who &s;hould manife&s;t his regard for Old England by
printing his addre&s;&s;es in the Old Engli&s;h character.</P>
<P>BUT in the whole republic of letters there are none perhaps who
are more obliged to the printer than the writers of periodical e&s;&s;ays. The
SPECTATORS indeed came into the world without any of the advantages we are
po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of. They were originally publi&s;hed in a very bad print and
paper, and were &s;o entirely de&s;titute of all outward ornaments, that (like
<HI>Terence</HI>'s virgin) 
<Q REND="inline">"unle&s;s the &s;oul of beauty had breath'd
through the compo&s;itions them&s;elves, the&s;e di&s;advantages would have
&s;uppre&s;s'd the lea&s;t appearances of it."</Q> 
<Q> 
<L>&mdash;n&icirc; vis boni</L> 
<L>In ip&s;&acirc; ine&s;&s;et form&acirc;, haec formam
extinguerent.</L></Q> </P>
<P>AS it requires no genius to &s;upply a defect of this na|ture,
our modern e&s;&s;ays as much excell the SPECTATORS <PB N="48" REF="53"> in
elegance of form, as perhaps they may be thought to fall &s;hort of them in
every other re&s;pect. But they have this additional advantage, that by the
finene&s;s of their paper they are re&s;cued from &s;erving many mean and
ignoble pur|po&s;es to which they might otherwi&s;e be applied. They al&s;o
form them&s;elves more commodiou&s;ly into volumes, and become genteeler
appendages of the tea-table. The candid reader will undoubtedly impute this
extraordinary care about externals to the mode&s;ty of us pre&s;ent
e&s;&s;ayi&s;ts, who are willing to compen&s;ate for our poverty of genius by
be&s;towing the&s;e outward graces and embelli&s;hments on our works. For my
own part I never reflect on the fir&s;t unadorned publication of the SPECTATOR,
and at the &s;ame time take up one of my own papers &s;et off with every
ornament of the pre&s;s, but I am afraid that the critics will apply what a
facetious peer is &s;aid to have remarked on a different occa&s;ion, that 
<Q REND="inline">"The fir&s;t is a &s;oul without a body, and the
la&s;t a body without a &s;oul."</Q></P>
<P>AS in this fa&s;hionable age there are many of Lord
<HI>Pop|pington</HI>'s opinion, that a book &s;hould be recommended by it's
out&s;ide to a man of quality and breeding, it is incum|bent on all authors to
appear as well dre&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, if they expect to be admitted into
polite company: yet we &s;hould not lay too much &s;tre&s;s on the decorations
of our works, but rather remember <HI>Tully</HI>'s precept to all who build,
that 
<Q REND="inline">"the owner &s;hould be an ornament to the
hou&s;e, and nor the hou&s;e to the owner."</Q></P>

<P>_THE publication of Lord <HI>Bolinbroke</HI>'s po&s;t|humous
works has given new life and &s;pirit to Freethinking. We &s;eem at pre&s;ent
to be endeavouring to unlearn our Catechi&s;m, with all that we have been

than plundering their country: but if the&s;e opinions &s;pread among the
vulgar, we &s;hall be knocked down at noonday in our &s;treets, and nothing
will go forward but robberies and murders.</P>
<P>THE in&s;tances I have lately &s;een of Freethinking in the
lower part of the world make me fear they are going to be as fa&s;hionable and
as wicked as their betters. I went the other night to the <HI>Robin Hood,</HI>
where it is u&s;ual for the advocates again&s;t religion to a&s;&s;emble, and
openly avow their infidelity. One of the que&s;tions for the night was, 
<Q REND="inline">"Whether Lord <HI>Bolinbroke</HI> had not done
greater &s;ervice to mankind by his writings than the Apo&s;tles or
Evangeli&s;ts?"</Q> As this &s;ociety is chiefly compo&s;ed of lawyers clerks,
petty trade&s;men, and the lowe&s;t mechanics, I was at fir&s;t &s;ur|prized to
find &s;uch amazing erudition among them. <HI>Toland, Tindal, Collins,
Chubb,</HI> and <HI>Mandeville,</HI> they &s;eemed to have got by heart. A
&s;hoemaker harangued his five minutes upon the excellence of the tenets
maintained by Lord <HI>Bolin|broke</HI>; but I &s;oon found that his reading
had not been ex|tended beyond the <HI>Idea of a Patriot King,</HI> which he had
mi&s;taken for a glorious &s;y&s;tem of Freethinking. I could not help
&s;miling at another of the company, who took pains to &s;hew his di&s;belief
of the Go&s;pel by un&s;ainting the Apo&s;tles, and calling them by no other
title than plain <HI>Paul,</HI> or plain <HI>Peter.</HI> The proceedings of
this &s;ociety have, in|deed, almo&s;t induced me to wi&s;h, that like the
Roman Ca|tholics, they were not permitted to read the Bible, rather than they
&s;hould read it, only to abu&s;e it.</P>
<P>I HAVE frequently heard many wi&s;e trade&s;men &s;ettling the
mo&s;t important articles of our faith over a pint of beer. A baker took
occa&s;ion from <HI>Canning</HI>'s affair to maintain, in <PB N="51" REF="56">
oppo&s;ition to the Scriptures, that man might live by bread alone, at lea&s;t
that woman might; for el&s;e, &s;aid he, how could the girl have been
&s;upported for a whole month by a few hard cru&s;ts? In an&s;wer to this, a
barber-&s;urgeon &s;et forth the improbability of that &s;tory, and thence
inferred, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for our Saviour to have fa&s;ted forty
days in the wilderne&s;s. I lately heard a mid&s;hipman &s;wear that the Bible
was all a lie: for he had &s;ailed round the world with Lord <HI>An&s;on,</HI>
and if there had been any Red Sea, he mu&s;t have met with it. I know a
bricklayer, who, while he was working by line and rule, and carefully laying
one brick upon another, would argue with a fellow-labourer, that the world was
made by chance; and a cook, who thought more of his trade than his bible, in a
di&s;pute about the miracles, made a plea&s;ant mi&s;take about the nature of
the fir&s;t, and gravely a&s;ked his antagoni&s;t what he thought of the SUPPER
at <HI>Cana.</HI></P>
<P>THIS affectation of Freethinking, among the lower cla&s;s of
people, is at pre&s;ent happily confined to the men. On Sundays, while the
hu&s;bands are toping at the alehou&s;e, the good women their wives think it
their duty to go to church, &s;ay their prayers, bring home the text, and read
the le&s;&s;ons with their families. But our polite ladies are, I fear, in
their lives and conver&s;ations little better than Freethinkers. Going to
church, &s;ince it is now no longer the fa&s;hion to carry on intrigues there,
is almo&s;t wholly laid a&s;ide; and I verily believe, that nothing but another
earthquake can ever fill the churches with people of quality. The fair &s;ex in
general are too thoughtle&s;s to concern them|&s;elves in deep enquiries into
matters of religion. It is &s;uf|ficient that they are taught to believe
them&s;elves angels: it would therefore be an ill compliment, while we talk of
the heaven they be&s;tow, to per&s;uade them into the <HI>Mahometan</HI> 
<PB N="52" REF="57"> notion, that they have no &s;ouls: tho' perhaps our fine
gentle|men may imagine, that by convincing a lady &s;he has no &s;oul, &s;he
will be le&s;s &s;crupulous about the di&s;po&s;al of her body.</P>
<P>THE ridiculous notions maintained by Freethinkers in their
writings &s;carce de&s;erve a &s;erious refutation; and per|haps the be&s;t
method of an&s;wering them would be to &s;elect from their works all the
ab&s;urd and impo&s;&s;ible notions, which they &s;o &s;tiffly maintain in
order to evade the belief of the Chri&s;tian Religion. I &s;hall here throw
together a few of their principal tenets under the contradictory title of</P>

<SALUTE>My Lords and Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>EVER &s;ince we have thought fit to take the&s;e
Kingdoms into our immediate Care, We have made it Our earn|e&s;t Endeavour to
go Hand in Hand with Your Wi&s;doms in <PB N="53" REF="58"> promoting the
Welfare and Pro&s;perity of the People. The important Bu&s;ine&s;s of Taxes,
Marriages, Jews and Lot|teries, We have left to Your weighty Con&s;ideration,
while Our&s;elves have been employed in the Regulation of Fa&s;hions, the
E&s;tabli&s;hment of Ta&s;te, and Amendment of the Morals. We have the
Satisfaction to find that both Our Mea&s;ures have hitherto met with Succe&s;s:
And the Public Affairs are at pre&s;ent in &s;o pro&s;perous a Condition, that
the National Vices &s;eem as likely to decrea&s;e as the National Debt.</P>
<P>THE Di&s;&s;olution of Your A&s;&s;embly is now at hand;
and as Your whole Attention will naturally be engaged in &s;e|curing to
Your&s;elves and Friends a Seat in the next Parlia|ment, it is needle&s;s to
recommend to You, that Heads &s;hould be broken, Drunkenne&s;s encouraged, and
Abu&s;e propagated; which has been found by Experience to be the be&s;t Method
of &s;upporting the Freedom of Elections. In the mean Time, as the Care of the
Nation mu&s;t be left to Us, it is nece&s;&s;ary that during this Interval Our
Preroga|tive, as CENSOR GENERAL, &s;hould be con&s;iderably ex|tended, and that
We &s;hould be inverted with the united Power of Lords and Commons.</P>
<P>WHEN We are entru&s;ted with this important Charge, We
&s;hall expect that every different Faction fhall concur in Our Mea&s;ures for
the Public Utility; that Whig and Tory, High Church and Low Church, Court and
Country, &s;hall all unite in this Common Cau&s;e; and that oppo&s;ite Parties
in the Body Politic, like the Arms and Legs in the Body Natural, &s;hall move
in Concert, though they are on different Sides. In Our Papers, which We &s;hall
continue to publi&s;h every <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> under the Title of <HI>The</HI>
CONNOISSEUR, every Mi&s;demeanor &s;hall be examined, and Offenders called to
the Bar of the Hou&s;e. Be it therefore enacted, that the&s;e 
<PB N="54" REF="59"> Our Orders and Re&s;olutions have an equal Authority with
Acts of Parliament, as We doubt not They will be of equal Advantage to the
Community.</P>
<P>THE extraordinary Supplies requi&s;ite for the Service
of the current Weeks, and for the Support of Our Own Privy Pur&s;e, oblige Us
to demand of You, that a Sum, not exceeding Two-pence, be levied Weekly on each
Per&s;on, to be collected by Our tru&s;ty and well-beloved the Book&s;ellers.
We mu&s;t al&s;o particularly reque&s;t of You, that the &s;ame Privilege and
Pro|tection be extended to Us which is enjoyed by Your&s;elves, and is &s;o
very convenient to many of your honourable Members. It is no le&s;s expedient
that We &s;hould be &s;ecured from Let or Mole&s;tation: Be it therefore
provided, that no one pre&s;ume to arre&s;t or cau&s;e to be arre&s;ted Our

<P>WE have only to add, that You may rely on Our Care and
Diligence in di&s;charging the high Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in Us, in &s;uch Manner
as &s;hall merit the Thanks of the next Parliament. We &s;hall then recommend
it to Their Con&s;ideration, whether it would not be for the Intere&s;t of
the&s;e Kingdoms, that We &s;hould have a Woolpack allotted Us with the
Bi&s;hops, or be allowed a Seat among the Commons, as the Repre&s;entative of
the whole People: But if this &s;hould be deemed too great an Honour, it will
at lea&s;t be thought nece&s;&s;ary that We &s;hould be occa&s;ionally called
in, like the Judges, to give Our Opinion on Ca&s;es of Importance.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="body of issue">
<P>_I AM obliged for to-day's paper to the &s;ame hand that
favoured me with the &s;eventh number.</P>
<P>LEARNING, as it poli&s;hes the mind enlarges our ideas, and
gives an ingenuous turn to all our conver|&s;ation and behaviour, has ever been
e&s;teemed a liberal ac|compli&s;hment; and is indeed the principal
characteri&s;tic that di&s;tingui&s;hes the gentleman from the mechanic.</P>
<P>THIS axiom being univer&s;ally allowed and approved of, I have
often ob&s;erved with wonder the neglect of learning that prevails among the
gentlemen of the army; who, not|with&s;tanding <PB N="56" REF="61"> their
&s;hameful deficiency in this main requi&s;ite, are generally propo&s;ed as the
mo&s;t exact models of good behaviour, and &s;tandards of politene&s;s.</P>
<P>THE art of war is no ea&s;y &s;tudy: it requires much labour and
application to go through what <HI>Milton</HI> calls 
<Q REND="inline">"the rudi|ments of &s;oldier&s;hip in all the
&s;kill of embattling, march|ing, encamping, fortifying, be&s;ieging and
battering, with all the helps of ancient and modern &s;tratagems, Tactics, and
warlike maxims."</Q> With all the&s;e every officer &s;hould undoubtedly be
acquainted; for mere regimentals no more create a &s;oldier, than the cowl a
monk. But, I fear, the generality of our army have made little proficiency in
the art they profe&s;s, have learnt little more than ju&s;t to acquit
them&s;elves with &s;ome decency at a review, have not &s;tudied and examined
as they ought the ancient and modern principles of war, 
<Q> 
<L>"Nor the divi&s;ion of a battle know,</L> 
<L>"More than a &s;pin&s;ter."</L> 
<BIBL>SHAKESPEARE.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>BESIDES the &s;tudy of the art of war it&s;elf, there are many
collateral branches of literature, of which, as gen|tlemen and as &s;oldiers,
they &s;hould not be ignorant. Who|ever bears a commi&s;&s;ion in the army
&s;hould be well read in hi&s;tory. The examples of <HI>Alexander,
Cae&s;ar,</HI> or <HI>Marl|borough,</HI> however illu&s;trious, are of little
concern to the generality of readers, but are &s;et up as &s;o many beacons, to
direct tho&s;e who are pur&s;uing the &s;ame cour&s;e to glory. A thorough
knowledge of hi&s;tory would furni&s;h a commander with true courage, in&s;pire
him with an hone&s;t emulation of his ance&s;tors, and teach him to gain a
victory without &s;hedding blood.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="62">POETRY too, more e&s;pecially that of the
ancients, &s;eems particularly calculated for the peru&s;al of tho&s;e
concerned in war. The &s;ubject of the <HI>Iliad</HI> is intirely martial, and
the principal characters are di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other chiefly by their
different exertion of the &s;ingle quality of courage. It was, I &s;uppo&s;e,
on account of this martial &s;pirit that breathes throughout the
<HI>Iliad,</HI> that <HI>Alexander</HI> was &s;o captivated with it that he is
&s;aid to have laid it every night under his pillow. The principal character in
the <HI>Aeneid</HI> is a general of remarkable piety and courage, and great
part of the poem is made up of war. The&s;e &s;tudies cannot &s;urely fail of
animating a modern brea&s;t, which often kindled &s;uch a noble ardour in the
antients.</P>
<P>IF we look into the lives of the greate&s;t generals of
anti|quity, we &s;hall find them no mean proficients in &s;cience. They led
their armies to victory by their courage, and &s;up|ported the &s;tate by their
coun&s;els. They revered the &s;ame <HI>Pallas</HI> as the godde&s;s of war and
of wi&s;dom; and the <HI>Spartans</HI> in particular, before they entered on an
engagement, always &s;acrificed to the <HI>Mu&s;es.</HI> The exhortations given
by commanders before the on&s;et are &s;ome of the mo&s;t animated pieces of
oratory in all antiquity, and frequently produced a&s;toni&s;hing effects,
rou&s;ing the &s;oldiers from de&s;pair, and hurrying them on to victory. An
illiterate commander would have been the contempt of <HI>Greece</HI> and
<HI>Rome. Tully</HI> indeed was called <HI>the learned Con&s;ul</HI> in
deri&s;ion, but then, as <HI>Dryden</HI> ob&s;erves, 
<Q REND="inline">"His head was turned another way; when he read
the <HI>Tactics,</HI> he was thinking on the bar, which was his field of
battle."</Q> I am particularly plea&s;ed with the cha|racter of <HI>Scipio
Aemilianus</HI> as drawn by <HI>Velleius Paterculus,</HI> and would recommend
it to the &s;erious imitation of our mo|dern officers. He was &s;o great an
admirer of liberal &s;tudies, that he always retained the mo&s;t eminent wits
in his camp: <PB N="58" REF="63"> nor did any one fill up the intervals of
bu&s;ine&s;s with more elegance, retiring from war only to cultivate the arts
of peace; always employed in arms or &s;tudy, always exerci&s;ing his body with
perils, or di&s;ciplining his mind with &s;cience. The author contra&s;ts this
amiable portrait with a de&s;cription of <HI>Mummius,</HI> a general &s;o
little ver&s;ed in the polite arts, that hav|ing taken at <HI>Corinth</HI>
&s;everal pictures and &s;tatues of the greate&s;t arti&s;ts, he threatened the
per&s;ons who were intru&s;ted with the carriage of them to <HI>Italy,</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"that if they lo&s;t tho&s;e they &s;hould give
new ones."</Q></P>
<P>I WOULD fain have a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> officer looked upon with
as much re&s;pect as tho&s;e of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome:</HI> but while
they neglect the acqui&s;ition of the &s;ame accompli&s;hments, this can never
be the ca&s;e. In&s;tead of cultivating their minds, they are wholly taken up
in adorning their bodies, and look upon gallantry and intrigue as e&s;&s;ential
parts of their character. To glitter in the boxes or at an a&s;&s;embly, is the
full di&s;play of their politene&s;s, and to be the life and &s;oul of a lewd
brawl almo&s;t the only exertion of their courage; in&s;omuch that there is a
good deal of ju&s;tice in <HI>Macheath's</HI> raillery, when he &s;ays, 
<Q REND="inline">"if it was not for us, and the other gentlemen
of the &s;word, <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> would be uninhabited."</Q></P>
<P>IT is &s;omething &s;trange that Officers &s;hould want any
in|ducement to acquire &s;o gentleman-like an accompli&s;hment as learning. If
they imagine it would derogate from their good-breeding, or call off their
attention from military bu&s;i|ne&s;s, they are mi&s;taken. Pedantry is no more
connected with learning, than ra&s;hne&s;s with courage. <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> who
was the fine&s;t gentleman and the greate&s;t general, was al&s;o the be&s;t
&s;cholar of his age.</P>
<P>TO &s;ay the truth, learning wears a more amiable a&s;pect and
winning air in courts and camps, whenever it appears <PB N="59" REF="64">
there, than amid the gloom of colleges and cloi&s;ters. Mixing in genteel life
files off the ru&s;t that may have been contracted by &s;tudy, and wears out
any little oddne&s;s or peculiarity that may be acquired in the clo&s;et. For
this rea&s;on the officer is more inexcu&s;able who neglects an
accompli&s;hment that would &s;it &s;o gracefully upon him: for this rea&s;on
too, we pay &s;o great deference to tho&s;e few, who have enriched their minds
with the trea&s;ures of antiquity. An illiterate officer either hardens into a
bravo, or refines into a fop: the in&s;ipi|dity of the fop is utterly
contemptible, and a rough brutal courage, unpoli&s;hed by &s;cience, and
una&s;&s;i&s;ted by rea&s;on, has no more claim to heroi&s;m than the
ca&s;e-harden'd valour of a brui&s;er or prize-fighter. Agreably to this notion
<HI>Homer</HI> in the fifth <HI>Iliad</HI> repre&s;ents the godde&s;s
<HI>Minerva</HI> as wounding <HI>Mars,</HI> and driving the heavy deity off the
field of battle; implying allegorically, that wi&s;dom is capable of &s;ubduing
courage.</P>
<P>I WOULD flatter my&s;elf that <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> minds are
&s;till as no|ble, and <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> genius as exuberant, as that of any
other nation or age whatever; but that &s;ome are deba&s;ed by luxury, and
others run wild for want of proper cultivation. If <HI>Athens</HI> can boa&s;t
her <HI>Miltiades, Themi&s;tocles,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Rome</HI> her <HI>Camillus,
Fabius, Cae&s;ar,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>England</HI> has had her <HI>Edwards,
Henrys,</HI> and <HI>Marlboroughs.</HI> It is to be hoped the time will come,
when learning will be reckoned as nece&s;&s;ary to qualify a man for the army,
as for the bar or pulpit. Then we may expect to &s;ee the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI>
&s;oldiery enter on the field of battle, as on a theatre, for which they are
prepared in the parts they are to act. 
<Q REND="inline">"They will not then (as <HI>Milton</HI>
expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf with his u&s;ual &s;trength in his <HI>Treati&s;e on
Education)</HI> if intru&s;ted with fair and hopeful armies, &s;uffer them, for
want of ju&s;t and wi&s;e di&s;cipline, to &s;hed away from about 
<PB N="60" REF="65"> them like &s;ick feathers, tho' they be never &s;o oft
&s;upplied: They would not &s;uffer their empty and unrecruitible co|lonels of
twenty men in a company, to quaff out, or con|vey into &s;ecret hoards, the
wages of a delu&s;ive li&s;t and a mi&s;erable remnant; yet in the mean while
to be over|ma&s;ter'd with a &s;core or two of drunkards, the only &s;oldiery
left about them, or el&s;e to comply with all ra|pines and violences. No
certainly, <HI>if they knew ought of that knowledge that belongs to good men
and good governors,</HI> they would not &s;uffer the&s;e thing."</Q></P>

<P>_THE principal character in <HI>Steel</HI>'s comedy of the
<HI>Lying Lover</HI> is young <HI>Bookwit</HI>; an Oxonian, who at once throws
off the habit and manners of an academic, and a&s;&s;umes the dre&s;s, air, and
conver&s;ation of a man of the town. He is, like other fine Gentlemen, a
coxcomb, but a coxcomb of learning and parts. His erudition he renders
&s;ub&s;ervient to his plea&s;ures: his knowledge in Poe|try qualifies him for
a &s;onneteer, his Rhetoric to &s;ay fine things to the ladies, and his
Philo&s;ophy to regulate his equi|page; for he talks of having
<HI>peripatetic</HI> footmen, a <HI>follower of Ari&s;tippus</HI> for a
<HI>Valet de Chambre,</HI> an <HI>epicurean</HI> cook, with an <HI>hermetical
chymi&s;t</HI> (who are good only at making fires) <PB N="62" REF="67"> for a
&s;cullion. Thus he is in every particular a fop of let|ters, a compleat
cla&s;&s;ical beau.</P>
<P>BY a review I have lately made of the people in this great
metropolis, as CENSOR, I find that the town &s;warms with <HI>Bookwits.</HI>
The play-hou&s;es, park, taverns and coffee-hou&s;es are thronged with them.
Their manner, which has &s;omething in it very characteri&s;tic, and different
from the town-bred coxcombs, di&s;covers them to the &s;lighte&s;t ob&s;ervers.
It is indeed no ea&s;y matter for one who&s;e chief employment is to &s;tore
his mind with new ideas, to throw that happy vacancy, that total ab&s;ence of
thought and re|flection into his countenance, &s;o remarkable in our modern
fine gentlemen. The &s;ame lownging air too that pa&s;&s;es for genteel in an
univer&s;ity coffee-hou&s;e is &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;h'd from the genuine
carele&s;s loll, and ea&s;y &s;aunter, and brings us over to the notion of Sir
<HI>Willfull</HI> in <HI>The Way of the World,</HI> that a man &s;hould be
bound 'prentice to a maker of fops, before he ventures to &s;et up for
him&s;elf.</P>
<P>YET, in &s;pite of all the&s;e di&s;advantages, the love of
plea&s;ure and a few &s;upernumerary guineas draws the &s;tudent from his
literary employment, and entices him to this theatre of noi&s;e and hurry, this
grand mart of plea&s;ure, where, as long as his pur&s;e can &s;upply him, he
may be as idle as he plea&s;es. I could not help &s;miling at a dialogue
between two of the&s;e gentlemen which I overheard a few nights ago at the
Bedford coffee-hou&s;e. 
<Q REND="inline">"Ha! Jack! (&s;ays one acco&s;ting the other) is
it you? How long have you been in town?"&mdash;</Q>

<P>I LEFT the coffee-hou&s;e pretty late, and as I came into the
piazza the fire in the <HI>Bedford's Arms</HI> kitchen blazed &s;o chearfully
and invitingly before me, that I was ea&s;ily per|&s;uaded by a friend that was
with me, to pa&s;s the evening at that hou&s;e. Our good fortune led us into
the next room to this knot of academical rakes. Their merriment being pretty
boi&s;terous gave us a good pretext to enquire what company were in the next
room. The waiter told us, with a &s;martne&s;s which tho&s;e fellows frequently
contract from at|tending on beaux and wits, 
<Q REND="inline">"Some gentlemen from <HI>Ox|ford</HI> with
&s;ome ladies, &s;ir. My ma&s;ter is always very glad to &s;ee them, for while
they &s;tay in town, they never dine or &s;up out of his hou&s;e, and eat and
drink, and pay better than any nobleman in town.</Q></P>
<P>AS it grew later, they grew louder: 'till at length an unhappy
di&s;pute aro&s;e between two of the company con|cerning the pre&s;ent grand
conte&s;t between the Old and New Intere&s;t, which has lately inflamed
<HI>Oxford&s;hire.</HI> This accident might have been attended with ugly
con&s;equences: but as the ladies are great enemies to quarrelling, unle&s;s
them&s;elves are the occa&s;ion, a good-natured female of the company
interpo&s;ed, and quelled their animo&s;ity. By the mediation of this fair one,
the di&s;pute ended very fa&s;hion|ably, in a bet of a dozen of claret to be
drank there by the company then pre&s;ent, whenever the wager &s;hould be
de|cided. There was &s;omething &s;o extraordinary in their whole evening's
conver&s;ation, &s;uch an odd mixture of the town and univer&s;ity, that I am
per&s;uaded, if Sir <HI>Richard</HI> had been witne&s;s to it, he could have
wrought it into a &s;cene as lively and entertaining as any he has left us.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="69">THE whole time the&s;e lettered beaux remain
in <HI>London</HI> is &s;pent in a continual round of diver&s;ion. Their
&s;phere in|deed is &s;omewhat confined, for they generally eat, drink, and
&s;leep within the precincts of <HI>Covent-Garden</HI>; where after having
pa&s;&s;ed a day or two in the highe&s;t &s;cenes of luxury and debauch, they
return (as <HI>Bookwit</HI> has it) to &s;mall beer and three-half-penny
commons.</P>
<P>I SHALL enlarge no further on this &s;ubject at pre&s;ent, but
conclude the&s;e reflexions with an ode which I have received from an unknown
corre&s;pondent, who tells me it was lately &s;ent to one of the&s;e gentlemen,
(who had re|&s;igned him&s;elf wholly to the&s;e polite enjoyments, and
&s;eemed to have forgot all his connexions with the univer&s;ity) from an
academical friend. All who peru&s;e this elegant little piece will, I doubt
not, thank me for in&s;erting it, and the learned reader will have the
additional plea&s;ure of admiring it as a plea&s;ant and humourous imitation of

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BESIDES the common objections made to the late Marriage-Bill,
my own family furni&s;hes me with a peculiar in&s;tance of the inconveniences
ari&s;ing from it, which (though I dare &s;ay many others have experienc'd) has
not yet been taken notice of. You mu&s;t know, Sir, that I have two daughters,
and it has ever been my greate&s;t con|cern <PB N="66" REF="71"> to &s;ee them
well &s;ettled. They have had &s;everal very advantageous offers, which I
&s;hould have been very well plea&s;ed with, and would have come down very
hand&s;omely; but they always put me off with &s;aying, that indeed they could
not think of leaving their dear papa, that they &s;hould never be &s;o happy
with hu&s;bands, as with each other,&mdash;and twenty excu&s;es of the like
nature. But the ca&s;e is now quite altered: and &s;ince the clamour about the
above|mentioned Act they are frighted out of their wits, le&s;t they &s;hould
get no hu&s;bands at all. My elde&s;t girl has ju&s;t taken it into her head to
be in love; and &s;he is very unea&s;y that I am again&s;t her having an idle
young fellow, who is not worth a penny, and whom till lately &s;he u&s;ed to
look upon with contempt. As to poor <HI>Bet&s;y,</HI> my younge&s;t girl, &s;he
has taken to the trick of eating chalk, oatmeal, and the like kind of tra&s;h,
which young girls are apt to grow fond of, when their thoughts are turned upon
an hu&s;band. I don't chu&s;e to &s;peak to them my&s;elf on this head; but as
the girls read your paper, I take this method of informing them that the
Marriage-Bill does not at all affect them, as they may depend on my not making
an ill u&s;e of my authority.</P>

<P>_TURNING over the la&s;t volume of Lord <HI>Bolinbroke</HI>'s
works a few days ago, I could not help &s;miling at his extraordinary man|ner
of commenting on &s;ome parts of the Scriptures. Among the re&s;t he
repre&s;ents <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> as making bea&s;ts accountable to the community
for crimes as well as men: whence his lord&s;hip infers, that the Jewi&s;h
Legi&s;lator &s;uppo&s;ed them capable of di&s;tin|gui&s;hing between right and
wrong, and acting as moral agents. The oddity of this remark led me to reflect,
that if &s;uch an opinion &s;hould prevail in any country, what whim&s;ical
laws would be enacted, and how ridi|culous they would appear when put in
execution: as if <PB N="68" REF="73"> the hor&s;e that carried the highwayman
&s;hould be ar|raigned for taking a pur&s;e, or a dog indicted for
feloni|ou&s;ly &s;tealing a &s;houlder of mutton. Such a country would &s;eem
to go upon the &s;ame principles, and to entertain the &s;ame notions of
ju&s;tice, as the puritannical old woman that hanged her cat for killing mice
on the &s;abbath-day.</P>
<P>THESE reflections were continued afterwards in my &s;leep; when
methought that &s;uch proceedings were com|mon in our own courts of judicature.
I imagined my|&s;elf in a &s;pacious hall like the <HI>Old Bailey,</HI> where
they were preparing to try &s;everal animals, who had been guilty of offences
again&s;t the laws of the land. The walls I ob&s;erved were hung all round with
bulls-hides, &s;heep|&s;kins, foxes tails, and the &s;poils of other brute
malefac|tors; and over the ju&s;tice-&s;eat, where the <HI>King's-Arms</HI> are
commonly placed, there was fixed a large &s;tag's head, which over&s;hadowed
the magi&s;trate with it's branching horns. I took particular notice that the
galleries were very much crouded with ladies; which I could not tell how to
account for, 'till I found it was expected that a Goat would be that day tried
for a rape.</P>
<P>THE &s;e&s;&s;ions &s;oon opened; and the fir&s;t pri&s;oner
that was brought to the bar was a Hog, who was pro&s;ecuted at the &s;uit of
the Jews on an indictment for burglary, in break|ing into their &s;ynagogue. As
it was apprehended that re|ligion might be affected by this cau&s;e, and as the
pro&s;ecu|tion appeared to be malicious, though the fact was plainly proved
again&s;t him, the Hog, to the great joy of all true chri&s;tians was allowed
<HI>benefit of clergy.</HI></P>
<P>AN indictment was next brought again&s;t a Cat for killing a
favourite Canary-bird. This offender belonged to an old <PB N="69" REF="74">
woman, who was believed by the neighbourhood to be a witch. The jury therefore
were unanimous in their opi|nion, that &s;he was the devil in that &s;hape, and
brought her in guilty. Upon which the judge formally pronounced &s;entence upon
her, which I remember concluded with the&s;e words: 
<Q REND="inline">"you mu&s;t be carried to the place of
exe|cution, where you are to be hanged by the neck nine times, 'till you are
dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead; and the fidlers have
mercy upon your guts."</Q></P>
<P>A PARROT was next tried for <HI>Scandalum Magnatum.</HI> He was
accu&s;ed by the Chief magi&s;trate of the city, and the whole court of
Aldermen, for defaming them as they pa&s;&s;ed along the &s;treet on a public
fe&s;tival, by &s;inging 
<Q REND="inline">"Room for cuckolds, here comes a great company;
room for cuck|olds here comes my Lord Mayor."</Q> This PARROT was a very old
offender, much addicted to &s;currility, and had been &s;everal times convicted
of prophane cur&s;ing and &s;wearing. He had even the impudence to abu&s;e the
whole court by calling the Jury rogues and ra&s;cals, and frequently
interrupted my Lord Judge in &s;umming up the evidence by crying out, Old
Bitch. The court however were plea&s;ed to &s;hew mercy to him upon the
petition of his mi&s;tre&s;s, a &s;trict methodi&s;t, who gave bail for his
good behaviour, and delivered him to Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> who undertook to
make a thorough convert of him.</P>
<P>AFTER this a Fox was indicted for robbing an hen-roo&s;t. Many
farmers appeared again&s;t him, who depo&s;ed that he was a very notorious
thief, and had long been the terror of ducks, gee&s;e, turkies and all other
poultry. He had infe&s;ted the country long time and had often been pur&s;ued,
but they could never take him before. As the Evidence was very 
<PB N="70" REF="75"> full again&s;t him, the jury readily brought him in
guilty; and the judge was proceeding to condemn him, when the &s;ly villain
watering his bru&s;h flirted it in the Face of the jai|lor, and made off. Upon
this a country '&s;quire who was pre&s;ent, hollowed out <HI>&s;tole away,</HI>
and a hue and cry was im|mediately &s;ent after him.</P>
<P>WHEN the uproar which this occa&s;ioned was over, a MILCH-ASS
was brought to the bar, and tried for contume|liou&s;ly braying, as &s;he
&s;tood at the door of a &s;ick lady of quality. It appeared that this lady was
terribly afflicted with the vapours, and could not bear the lea&s;t noi&s;e;
had the knocker always tyed up, and &s;traw laid in the &s;treet.
Not|with&s;tanding which this audacious creature u&s;ed every morning to give
her foul language, which broke her re&s;t, and flung her into hy&s;terics. For
this repeated abu&s;e the criminal was &s;entenced to the pillory, and ordered
to lo&s;e her ears.</P>
<P>AN information was next laid again&s;t a Shepherd's DOG upon the
GAME-ACT for poaching. He was accu&s;ed of killing an hare without being
properly qualified. But the plaintiff thought it advi&s;eable to qua&s;h the
indictment, as the owner of the dog had a vote to &s;ell at the next
election.</P>
<P>THERE now came on a very important cau&s;e, in which &s;ix of
the mo&s;t eminent council learned in the law were retained on each &s;ide. A
MONKEY, belonging to a lady of the fir&s;t rank and fa&s;hion, was indicted,
for that he with malice prepen&s;e did commit wilful murder on the body of a
lap-dog. The council for the pro&s;ecutor &s;et forth, that the unfortunate
decea&s;ed came on a vi&s;it with another lady; when the Pri&s;oner at the bar,
without the lea&s;t provocation, and contrary to the laws of ho&s;pitality,
perpetrated this in|human <PB N="71" REF="76"> fact. The council for the
pri&s;oner being called upon to make the MONKEY's defence, pleaded his
privilege, and in&s;i&s;ted on his being tried by his peers. This plea was
ad|mitted without demurr, and a jury of beaux was immediately impannelled, who
without going out of court honourably acquitted him.</P>
<P>THE proceedings were here interrupted by a HOUND, who came
jumping into the Hall, and running to the Ju&s;|tice-Seat lifted up his leg
again&s;t the Judge's robe. For this contemptuous behaviour he was directly
ordered into cu&s;tody, when to our great &s;urprize he ca&s;t his &s;kin, and
became an OSTRICH; and pre&s;ently after &s;hed his feathers, and terri|fied us
in the figure of a BEAR. Then he was a LION, then an HORSE, then again a
BABOON; and after many o|other amazing transformations leaped out an HARLEQUIN,
and before they could take hold of him &s;kipped away to
<HI>Co|vent-Garden</HI> theatre.</P>
<P>IT would be tedious to recount the particulars of &s;everal
other trials. A &s;port&s;man brought an action again&s;t a RACE-HORSE for
running on the wrong &s;ide of the po&s;t, by which he lo&s;t the
<HI>Plate</HI> and many con&s;iderable betts. For this the criminal was
&s;entenced to be burnt in the forehand, and to be whipt at the Cart's tail. A
Mare would have undergone the &s;ame puni&s;hment for throwing her rider in a
Stag-hunt, but e&s;caped by pleading her belly; upon which a jury of grooms was
impannelled, who brought her in quick. The company of DOGS and MONKEYS together
with the DAN|CING BEARS, who were taken up on the LICENSE-ACT, and indicted for
Strollers, were tran&s;ported for life.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t trial was for high trea&s;on. A LION, who had been
long confined as a State-pri&s;oner in the TOWER, having <PB N="72" REF="77">
broke goal, had appeared in open rebellion, and commit|ted &s;everal acts of
violence on his MAJESTY's liege-&s;ubjects. As this was a noble animal, and a
prince of the blood in his own native country, he was condemned to be beheaded.
It came into my thoughts, that this LION's HEAD might vie with that famous one
formerly erected at <HI>Button</HI>'s for the &s;ervice of the GUARDIAN: I was
accordingly going to peti|tion for leave to &s;et it up in <HI>Macklin</HI>'s
new Coffee-hou&s;e; when methought the Lion, &s;etting up a mo&s;t horrible
roar, broke his chains and put the whole court to flight; and I awaked in the
utmo&s;t con&s;ternation, ju&s;t as I imagined he had got me in his gripe.</P>

<P>_I SHALL this day pre&s;ent my readers with a letter which I
have received from my cou&s;in VILLAGE; who, as I informed them in my fir&s;t
paper, has undertaken to &s;end me an account of every thing remarkable that
pa&s;&s;es in the country.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>DEAR COUSIN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE not been unmindful of the province which you was
plea&s;ed to allot me; but the whole country has been lately &s;o much taken up
with the bu&s;ine&s;s of Elec|tions, that nothing has fallen under my notice,
but debates, &s;quabbles, and drunken rencounters. The &s;pirit of party 
<PB N="74" REF="79"> prevails &s;o univer&s;ally, that the very children are
in&s;tructed to li&s;p out the names of the favourite chiefs of each fac|tion;
and I have more than once been in danger of being knocked off my hor&s;e, as I
rode peaceably on, becau&s;e I did not declare with which party I &s;ided,
though I knew nothing at all of either. Every petty village abounds with the
mo&s;t profound &s;tate&s;men: it is common to &s;ee our ru&s;tic politicians
a&s;&s;embling after &s;ermon, and &s;ettling the good of their country
acro&s;s a tomb-&s;tone, like &s;o many <HI>Dictators from the plough</HI>; and
every cottage can boa&s;t its patriot, who, like the old <HI>Roman,</HI> would
not exchange his turnip for a bribe.</P>
<P>I AM at pre&s;ent in &mdash;, where the election is ju&s;t
coming on, and the whole town con&s;equently in an uproar. They have for
&s;everal parliaments returned two members, who recommended them&s;elves by
con&s;tantly oppo&s;ing the court: but there came down a few days ago a banker
from <HI>London,</HI> who has offered him&s;elf a candidate, and is backed with
the mo&s;t powerful of all intere&s;ts, money. Nothing has been &s;ince thought
of but fea&s;ting and revell|ing; and both parties &s;trive to outdo each other
in the frequency and expence of their entertainments. This indeed is the
general method made u&s;e of to gain the favour of electors, and manife&s;t a
zeal for the con&s;titution. I have known a candidate depend more upon the
&s;trength of his liquor than his arguments; and the merits of a treat has
often recommended a member, who has had no merits of his own; for it is
certain, that people, however they may differ in other points, are unanimous in
promoting the grand bu&s;ine&s;s of eating and drinking.</P>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible to give a particular account of the
various di&s;orders occa&s;ioned by the conte&s;t in this town. The 
<PB N="75" REF="80"> &s;treets ring with the different cry of each party, and
every hour produces a ballad, a &s;et of queries, or a &s;erious ad|dre&s;s to
the worthy electors. I have &s;een the Mayor with half the Corporation roaring,
hollowing, and reeling along the &s;treets, and yet threatening to clap a poor
fellow in the &s;tocks for making the &s;ame noi&s;e, only becau&s;e he would
not vote as they do. It is no wonder that the &s;tronge&s;t connexions &s;hould
be broken, and the mo&s;t inti|mate friends &s;et at variance, through their
difference of opinion. Not only the men, but their wives al&s;o are engaged in
the &s;ame quarrel. Mr. <HI>Staunch</HI> the haberda&s;her u&s;ed to &s;moke
his pipe con&s;tantly in the &s;ame kitchen-corner every evening at the &s;ame
alehou&s;e with his neighbour Mr. <HI>Veer</HI> the chandler, while their
ladies chatted together at the &s;treet-door: but now the hu&s;bands never
&s;peak to each other; and con&s;equently Mrs. <HI>Veer</HI> goes a quarter of
a mile for her inkle and tape, rather than deal at Mr. <HI>Staunch</HI>'s
&s;hop; and Mrs. <HI>Staunch</HI> declares, &s;he would go without her tea,
though &s;he has always been u&s;ed to it twice a day, rather than fetch her
half quartern from that turn-coat <HI>Veer</HI>'s.</P>
<P>WHEREVER Politics are introduc'd, Religion is always drawn
into the quarrel. The town I have been &s;peaking of is divided into two
parties, who are di&s;tingui&s;h'd by the appellation of <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI>
and <HI>Jews.</HI> The <HI>Jews,</HI> it &s;eems, are tho&s;e, who are in the
intere&s;t of a nobleman who gave his vote for pa&s;&s;ing the
<HI>Jew</HI>-bill, and are held in abomi|nation by the <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI>
The zeal of the latter is &s;till further inflamed by the vicar, who every
&s;unday thunders out his anathemas, and preaches up the pious doctrine of
per&s;ecution. In this he is &s;econded by the clerk, who is careful to enforce
the arguments from the pulpit by &s;e|lecting &s;taves proper for the
occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="81">THIS truly <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> &s;pirit
is no where more manife&s;t than at their public fea&s;ts. I was at one of
their dinners, where I found great variety of pig-meat was provided. The table
was covered from one end to the other with hams, legs of pork, &s;pare-ribs,
gri&s;kins, ha&s;lets, feet and ears, brawn, and the like: in the middle there
&s;moaked a large barbicued hog, which was &s;oon devour'd to the bone; &s;o
de&s;irous was every one to prove his <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> by the quantity
he could &s;wallow of that <HI>Anti-Judaic</HI> food. After dinner there was
brought in, by way of de&s;ert, a di&s;h of hogs puddings; but as I have a
di&s;like to that kind of diet, (though not from any &s;cruple of
con&s;cience,) I was regarded as little better than a <HI>Jew</HI> for
declining to eat of them.</P>
<P>THE great &s;upport of this party is an old neighbouring
knight; who, ever &s;ince the late naturalization-act, has conceived a violent
antipathy to the <HI>Jews,</HI> and takes every opportunity of railing at the
above-mentioned nobleman. Sir <HI>Rowland</HI> &s;wears that his lord&s;hip is
wor&s;e than <HI>Judas,</HI> that he is actually circumci&s;ed, and that the
chapel in this nobleman's hou&s;e is turned into a &s;ynagogue. The knight had
never been &s;een in a church, 'till the late clamour about the
<HI>Jew</HI>-bill; but he now attends it regularly every &s;unday, where he
devoutly takes his nap all the &s;ervice; and he lately be&s;towed the be&s;t
living in his gift, which he had before promi&s;ed to his chaplain, on one whom
he had never &s;een, but had read his name in the title-page to a &s;ermon
again&s;t the <HI>Jews.</HI> He turned off his butler, who had lived with him
many years, and who&s;e only crime was a &s;warthy complexion, becau&s;e the
dog looked like a <HI>Jew.</HI> He feeds hogs in his park and the court-yard,
and has Guinea-pigs in his parlour. Every &s;aturday he has an hunt, becau&s;e
it is the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> &s;ubbath; and in the evening he 
<PB N="77" REF="82"> is &s;ure to get drunk with the vicar in defence of
religion. As he is in the commi&s;&s;ion, he ordered a poor <HI>Jew</HI>
pedlar, who came to hawk goods at his hou&s;e, to <HI>Bridewell</HI>; and he
was once going to &s;end a little pari&s;h-boy to the &s;ame place, for
pre&s;uming to play in his wor&s;hip's hearing on that unchri&s;tian-like
in&s;trument the <HI>Jews-Harp.</HI></P>
<P>THE fair &s;ex here are no le&s;s ambitious of di&s;playing
their affection for the &s;ame cau&s;e, and they manife&s;t their &s;entiments
by the colour and fa&s;hion of their dre&s;s. Their zeal more particularly
&s;hews it&s;elf in a variety of po&s;ies for rings, buckles, knots, and
garters. I ob&s;erved the other night at the a&s;&s;embly, that the ladies
&s;eemed to vie with each other in hanging out the en&s;igns of their faith in
orthodox ribbands, bearing the in&s;cription of NO JEWS, CHRISTIANITY FOR EVER.
They likewi&s;e wore little cro&s;&s;es at their brea&s;ts; their
<HI>pompons</HI> were formed into crucifixes, their knots di&s;po&s;ed in the
&s;ame angles, and &s;o many parts of their habits moulded into that &s;hape,
that the whole a&s;&s;embly looked like the court on St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s day.
It was remarkable that the vicar's lady, who is a thorough-paced
High-Churchwoman, was more religious in the decorations of her dre&s;s than any
of the company: in a word, &s;he was &s;o &s;tuck over from head to foot with
cro&s;&s;es, that a wag ju&s;tly compared her to an old <HI>Popi&s;h</HI>
tomb-&s;tone in a <HI>Gothic</HI> cathedral.</P>
<P>I SHALL now conclude my letter with the relation of an
adventure, that happened to my&s;elf at my fir&s;t coming into this town. I
intended to put up at the <HI>Catherine-Wheel,</HI> as I had often u&s;ed the
hou&s;e before, and knew the landlord to be a good civil kind of fellow. I
accordingly turned my hor&s;e into the yard, when to my great &s;urprize the
landlord, as &s;oon as he &s;aw me, gave me an hearty <PB N="78" REF="83">
cur&s;e, and told me I might go about my bu&s;ine&s;s, 
<Q REND="inline">"for in|deed he would not entertain any &s;uch
ra&s;cals."</Q> Upon this he &s;aid &s;omething to two or three &s;trapping
country-fellows, who immediately came towards me, and if I had not rode away
directly, I &s;hould have met with a very rough &s;alutation from their
hor&s;e-whips. I could not ima|gine what offence I had commited, that could
give occa|&s;ion for &s;uch ill u&s;age, 'till I heard the ma&s;ter of the inn
hollowing after me 
<Q REND="inline">"that's the &s;coundrel that came here &s;ome

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_AS the ladies are naturally become the im|mediate objects of
your care, will you permit a complaint to be in&s;erted in your paper, which is
founded upon a matter of fact? They will pardon me, if by laying before you a
particular in&s;tance I was lately witne&s;s to of their im|proper behaviour, I
endeavour to expo&s;e a reigning evil which &s;ubjects them to many &s;hameful
imputations.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="85">I RECEIVED la&s;t week a dinner-card from
a friend, with an intimation that I &s;hould meet &s;ome very agreeable ladies.
At my arrival I found that the company con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of females, who
indeed did me the honour to ri&s;e, but quite di&s;concerted me in paying my
re&s;pects by their whi&s;pering each other and appearing to &s;tifle a laugh.
When I was &s;eated, the ladies grouped them&s;elves up in a corner, and
entered into a private cabal, &s;eemingly to di&s;cour&s;e upon points of great
&s;ecre&s;y and importance, but of equal merriment and diver&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame conduct of keeping clo&s;e to their ranks was
ob&s;erved at table, where the ladies &s;eated them&s;elves together. Their
conver&s;ation was here al&s;o confined wholly to them|&s;elves, and &s;eemed
like the my&s;teries of the <HI>Bona Dea,</HI> in which men were forbidden to
have any &s;hare. It was a continued laugh and a whi&s;per from the beginning
to the end of dinner. A whole &s;entence was &s;carce ever &s;poken aloud.
Single words indeed now and then broke forth; &s;uch as <HI>odious, horrible,
dete&s;table, &s;hocking,</HI> HUMBUG. This la&s;t new-coined expre&s;&s;ion,
which is only to be found in the non&s;en&s;ical vocabulary, &s;ounds ab&s;urd
and di&s;agreeable when|ever it is pronounced; but from the mouth of a lady it
is 
<Q REND="inline">"&s;hocking, dete&s;table, horrible, and
odious."</Q></P>
<P>MY friend &s;eemed to be but in an unea&s;y &s;ituation at his
own table: but I was far more mi&s;erable. I was mute, and &s;eldom dared to
lift up my eyes from my plate, or turn my head to call for &s;mall beer, le&s;t
by &s;ome aukward po&s;ture I might draw upon me a whi&s;per or a laugh.
<HI>Sancho,</HI> when he was forbid to eat of a delicious banquet &s;et before
him, could &s;carce appear more melancholy. The rueful length of my face might
po&s;&s;ibly encrea&s;e the mirth of my tormen|tors: at lea&s;t their joy
&s;eemed to ri&s;e in exact proportion with <PB N="81" REF="86"> my mi&s;ery.
At length, however, the time of my delivery approached. Dinner ended, the
ladies made their exits in pairs, and went off hand in hand, whi&s;pering like
the two Kings of <HI>Brentford.</HI></P>
<P>MODEST men, Mr. TOWN, are deeply wounded, when they imagine
them&s;elves the objects of ridicule or contempt; and the pain is the greater,
when it is given by tho&s;e whom they admire, and from whom they are ambitious
of receiving any marks of countenance and favour. Yet we mu&s;t allow that
affronts are pardonable from ladies, as they are often progno&s;tics of future
kindne&s;s. If a lady &s;trikes our cheek, we can very willingly follow the
precept of the Go&s;pel, and turn the other cheek to be &s;mitten. Even a blow
from a fair hand conveys plea&s;ure:&mdash;but this battery of whi&s;pers is
again&s;t all legal rights of war;&mdash;poi&s;oned arrows, and &s;tabs in the
dark, are not more repugnant to the general laws of humanity.</P>
<P>MODERN writers of comedy often introduce a pert wit|ling into
their pieces, who is very &s;evere upon the re&s;t of the company; but all his
waggery is &s;poken <HI>a&s;ide.</HI> The&s;e giglers and whi&s;perers &s;eem
to be acting the &s;ame part in company, that this arch rogue does in the play.
Every word or motion produces a train of whi&s;pers; the dropping of a
&s;nuff-box, or &s;pilling the tea, is &s;ure to be accompanied with a titter;
and upon the entrance of any one with &s;omething particular in his per&s;on or
manner, I have &s;een a whole room in a buzz like a bee-hive.</P>
<P>THIS practi&s;e of whi&s;pering, if it is any where allowable,
may perhaps be indulged the fair &s;ex at church, where the conver&s;ation can
only be carried on by the &s;ecret &s;ymbols of a curt&s;y, an ogle, or a nod.
A whi&s;per in this place is very <PB N="82" REF="87"> often of great u&s;e, as
it &s;erves to convey the mo&s;t &s;ecret intel|ligence, which a lady would be
ready to bur&s;t with, if &s;he could not find vent for it by this kind of
auricular confe&s;&s;ion. A piece of &s;canda1 tran&s;pires in this manner from
one pew to another, then pre&s;ently whizzes along the chancel, from whence it
crawls up to the galleries, till at la&s;t the whole church hums with it.</P>
<P>IT were al&s;o to be wi&s;hed, that the ladies would be
plea&s;ed to confine them&s;elves to whi&s;pering in their <HI>t&ecirc;te
&agrave; t&ecirc;te</HI> conferences at an opera or the play-hou&s;e; which
would be a proper deference to the re&s;t of the audience. In <HI>France,</HI>
we are told, it is common for the <HI>Parterre</HI> to join with the performers
in any favourite air; but we &s;eem to have carried this cu&s;tom &s;till
further, as our boxes, without concerning them&s;elves in the lea&s;t with the
play, are even louder than the players. The wit and humour of a
<HI>Vanbrugh</HI> is frequently interrupted by a brilliant dialogue between two
per&s;ons of fa&s;hion; and a love-&s;cene in the &s;ide-box has often been
more attended to than that on the &s;tage. As to their loud bur&s;ts of
laughter at the theatre, they may very well be excu&s;ed, when they are excited
by any lively &s;trokes in a comedy: but I have &s;een our ladies titter at the
mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;sful &s;cenes in <HI>Romeo</HI> and <HI>Juliet,</HI> grin
over the angui&s;h of a <HI>Monimia</HI> or <HI>Belvidera,</HI> and fairly
laugh King <HI>Lear</HI> off the &s;tage.</P>
<P>THUS the whole behaviour of the&s;e ladies is in direct
con|tradiction to good manners. They laugh when they &s;hould cry, are loud
when they &s;hould be &s;ilent, and are &s;ilent when their conver&s;ation is
de&s;irable. If a man in a &s;elect company was thus to laugh or whi&s;per me
out of countenance, I &s;hould be apt to con&s;true it as an affront, and
demand an explanation. As to the ladies, I would de&s;ire them to reflect how
much <PB N="83" REF="88"> they would &s;uffer, if their own weapons were turned
again&s;t them, and the gentlemen &s;hould attack them with the &s;ame arts of
laughing and whi&s;pering. But, however free they may be from our re&s;entment,
they are &s;till open to ill-natured &s;u&s;picions. They do not con&s;ider,
what &s;trange con&s;tructions may be put on the&s;e laughs and whi&s;pers. It
were, indeed, of little con&s;equence, if we only imagined that they were
taking the reputations of their acquaintance to pieces, or abu&s;ing the
company round; but when they indulge them|&s;elves in this behaviour, &s;ome
perhaps may be led to conclude, that they are di&s;cour&s;ing upon topics,
which they are afraid or a&s;hamed to &s;peak of in a le&s;s private
manner.</P>
<P>IF the mi&s;conduct which I have de&s;cribed had been only to
be found, Mr. TOWN, at my friend's table, I &s;hould not have troubled you with
this letter: but the &s;ame kind of ill-breeding prevails too often and in too
many places. The giglers and the whi&s;perers are innumerable; they be&s;et us
wherever we go; and it is ob&s;ervable, that after a &s;hort murmur of
whi&s;pers out comes the bur&s;t of laughter:&mdash;like a gun-powder
&s;erpent, which, after hi&s;&s;ing about for &s;ome time, goes off in a
bounce.</P>
<P>SOME excu&s;e may perhaps be framed for this ill-timed
merriment in the fair &s;ex. <HI>Venus,</HI> the godde&s;s of beauty, is
frequently called the <HI>laughter-loving dame</HI>; and by laughing our modern
ladies may po&s;&s;ibly imagine, that they render them&s;elves like
<HI>Venus.</HI> I have indeed remarked, that the ladies commonly adju&s;t their
laugh to their per&s;ons, and are merry in proportion as it &s;ets off their
particular charms. One lady is never further moved than to a &s;mile or a
&s;imper, be|cau&s;e nothing el&s;e &s;hows her dimples to &s;o much advantage;
another, who has a very fine &s;et of teeth, runs into the broad grin; while a
third, who is admired for a well-turned <PB N="84" REF="89"> neck and graceful
che&s;t, calls up all her beauties to view by breaking out in violent and
repeated peals of laughter.</P>
<P>I WOULD not be under&s;tood to impo&s;e gravity or too great a
re&s;erve on the fair &s;ex. Let them laugh at a feather, but let them declare
openly that it is a feather which occa&s;ions their mirth. I mu&s;t confe&s;s,
that laughter becomes the young, the gay, and the hand&s;ome: but a whi&s;per
is unbe|coming at all ages and in both &s;exes; nor ought it ever to be
practi&s;ed, except in the round gallery at St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s, or in the
famous whi&s;pering place in <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI> cathedral, where two
whi&s;perers hear each other at the di&s;tance of five and twenty yards.</P>

<P>_A FRIEND of mine who belongs to the Stamp-Office acquaints me,
that the revenue ari&s;ing from the duty on cards and dice continues to
increa&s;e every year, and that it now brings in near &s;ix times more than it
did at fir&s;t. This will not appear very wonderful, when we con&s;ider that
gaming is now become rather the bu&s;ine&s;s than amu&s;e|ment of our per&s;ons
of quality; that their whole attention is employed in this important article,
and that they are more concerned about the tran&s;actions of the two clubs at
<HI>White</HI>'s than the proceedings of both Hou&s;es of Parliament. Thus it
happens that e&s;tates are now almo&s;t as frequently made over by whi&s;t and
hazard as by deeds and &s;ettlements; and <PB N="86" REF="91"> the chariots of
many of our nobility may be &s;aid (like Count <HI>Ba&s;&s;et</HI>'s in the
play) 
<Q REND="inline">"to roll upon the four aces."</Q></P>
<P>THIS love of gaming has taken &s;uch entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of their ideas, that it infects their common conver&s;ation. The management of
a di&s;pute was formerly attempted by rea&s;on and argument; but the new way of
adju&s;ting all difference in opinion is by the &s;word or a wager: &s;o that
the only gen|teel method of di&s;&s;ent is to ri&s;k a thou&s;and pounds, or
take your chance of being run through the body. The &s;trange cu&s;tom of
deciding every thing by a wager is &s;o univer&s;al, that if (in imitation of
<HI>Swift)</HI> any body was to publi&s;h a &s;pecimen of <HI>Polite
Conver&s;ation,</HI> in&s;tead of old &s;ayings and trite repar|tees he would
in all probability fill his dialogues with little more than bet after bet, or
now and then a calculation of the odds.</P>
<P>WHITE's, the pre&s;ent grand &s;cene of the&s;e tran&s;actions
was formerly di&s;tingui&s;hed by gallantry and intrigue. During the
publication of the <HI>Tatler,</HI> Sir <HI>Richard Steel</HI> thought pro|per
to date all his love-news from that quarter: but it would now be as ab&s;urd to
pretend to gather any &s;uch intelligence from <HI>White</HI>'s; as to &s;end
to <HI>Bat&s;on</HI>'s for a lawyer, or to the <HI>Roll</HI>'s Coffee-hou&s;e
for a man-midwife.</P>
<P>THE gentlemen who now frequent this place profe&s;s a kind of
univer&s;al Sceptici&s;m; and as they look upon every thing as dubious, put the
i&s;&s;ue upon a wager. There is no|thing however trivial or ridiculous, which
is not capable of producing a bet. Many pounds have been lo&s;t upon the colour
of a coach-hor&s;e, an article in the news, or the change of the weather. The
birth of a child has brought great ad|vantages to per&s;ons not in the lea&s;t
related to the family it was born in; and the breaking off a match has affected
many in their fortunes, be&s;ides the parties immediately concerned.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="92">BUT the mo&s;t extraordinary part of this
fa&s;hionable practice is what in the gaming dialect is called, <HI>pitting one
man again&s;t another</HI>; that is, in plain Engli&s;h, wagering which of the
two will live longe&s;t. In this manner people of the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite
characters make up the &s;ubject of a bet. A player perhaps is pitted again&s;t
a duke, an alderman again&s;t a bi&s;hop, or a pimp with a privy-coun&s;ellor.
There is &s;carce one remarkable per&s;on, upon who&s;e life there are not many
thou&s;and pounds depending, or one per&s;on of quality who&s;e death will not
leave &s;everal of the&s;e kinds of mortgages upon his e&s;tate. The various
changes in the health of one, who is the &s;ubject of many bets, occa&s;ions
very &s;e|rious reflections in tho&s;e who have ventured large &s;ums on his
life and death. Tho&s;e who would be gainers by his decea&s;e, upon every
flight indi&s;po&s;ition, watch all the &s;tages of his illne&s;s, and are as
impatient for his death, as the undertaker who expects to have the care of his
funeral; while the other &s;ide are very &s;ollicitous about his recovery,
&s;end every hour to know how he does, and take as much care of him, as a
clergyman's wife does of her hu&s;band who has no other fortune than his
living. I remember a man with the con&s;titution of a porter, upon who&s;e life
very great odds were laid; but when the per&s;on he was pitted again&s;t was
expected to dye every week, this man unexpectedly &s;hot him&s;elf through the
head, and the know|ing ones were taken in.</P>
<P>THOUGH mo&s;t of our follies are imported from <HI>France,</HI>
this has had its ri&s;e and progre&s;s entirely in <HI>England.</HI> In the
la&s;t illne&s;s of <HI>Louis</HI> the fourteenth Lord <HI>Stair</HI> laid a
wager on his death; and we may gue&s;s what the <HI>French</HI> thought of it,
from the manner in which <HI>Voltaire</HI> mentions it in his <HI>Si&eacute;cle
de Louis</HI> xiv. 
<Q REND="inline">"Le Roi fut attaqu&egrave; vers le milieu 
<PB N="88" REF="93"> mois d'Ao&ucirc;t. Le Comte de Stair Amba&s;&s;adeur
d'Angle|terre PARIA, <HI>&s;elon le genie de &s;a nation,</HI> que le Roi ne
pa&s;&s;eroit pas le mois de Septembre."</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"The King, &s;ays he, was taken ill about the
middle of Augu&s;t; when Lord <HI>Stair,</HI> the amba&s;&s;ador from
<HI>England</HI> BETTED, <HI>according to the genius of his nation,</HI> that
the King would not live beyond September.</Q></P>
<P>I AM in &s;ome pain le&s;t this cu&s;tom &s;hould get among the
ladies. They are at pre&s;ent very deep in cards and dice; and while my lord is
gaming abroad, her lady&s;hip has her rout at home. I am inclined to
&s;u&s;pect that our women of fa&s;hion will al&s;o learn to divert
them&s;elves with this polite practice of laying wagers. A birthday &s;uit, the
age of a beauty, who invented a particular fa&s;hion, or who were &s;uppos'd to
be together at the la&s;t ma&s;querade, would frequently give occa&s;ion for
bets. This would al&s;o afford them a new method for the ready propagation of
&s;candal, as the truth of &s;everal &s;tories which are continually flying
about the town would naturally be brought to the &s;ame te&s;t. Should they
proceed further to &s;take the lives of their acquaintance again&s;t each
other, they would doubtle&s;s bet with the &s;ame fearle&s;s &s;pirit as they
are known to do at brag: one hu&s;band perhaps would be pitted again&s;t
another, or a woman of the town again&s;t a maid of honour. In a word, if this
once becomes fa&s;hionable among the ladies, we &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee the time,
when an allowance for <HI>bet-money</HI> will be &s;tipulated in the Marriage
Articles.</P>
<P>AS the vices and follies of per&s;ons of di&s;tinction are very
apt to &s;pread, I am much afraid le&s;t this branch of gaming &s;hould
de&s;cend to the common people. Indeed it &s;eems already to have got among
them. We have frequent <PB N="89" REF="94"> accounts in the daily papers of
trade&s;men riding, walking, eating and drinking for a wager. The conte&s;ted
election in the city has occa&s;ioned &s;everal extraordinary bets: I know a
butcher in <HI>Leadenball</HI> market, who laid an ox to a &s;hin of beef on
the &s;ucce&s;s of Sir <HI>John Barnard</HI> again&s;t the field; and have been
told of a Publican in <HI>Thames</HI> &s;treet, who ventured an hog&s;head of
intire butt on the candi|date who &s;erves him with beer.</P>
<P>WE may ob&s;erve that the &s;pirit of gaming di&s;plays it&s;elf
with as much variety among the lowe&s;t as the highe&s;t order of people. It is
the &s;ame thing, whether the dice rattle in an orange barrow or at the Hazard
table. A couple of chairmen in a night-cellar are as eager at put or all-fours,
as a party at St. <HI>James</HI>'s at a rubber of whi&s;t; and the E. O. table
is but an higher &s;ort of <HI>Merry-go-round,</HI> where you may get &s;ix
halfpence for one, &s;ix pence for one, and &s;ix twopences for one. If the
practi&s;e of pitting &s;hould be al&s;o propagated among the vulgar, it will
be common for prize|fighters to &s;take their lives again&s;t each other, and
two pickpockets may lay which of them &s;hall fir&s;t go to the gallows.</P>
<P>TO give the reader a full idea of one wholly employed in this
manner, I &s;hall conclude my paper with the character <HI>Montano.
Montano</HI> was born heir to a nobleman remark|able for deep play, from whom
he very early imbibed the principles of gaming. When he was at &s;chool, he was
the mo&s;t expert of any of his playfellows at taw, and would often &s;trip
them of their whole week's allowance at chuck. He was afterwards at the head of
every match at football or cricket; and when he was captain he made a lottery,
but went away without drawing the prizes. He is &s;till <PB N="90" REF="95">
talked of at the &s;chool for a famous di&s;pute he had with another of his own
ca&s;t about their &s;uperiority in learning; which they decided by to&s;&s;ing
up heads or tails who was the be&s;t &s;cholar. Being too great a genius for
our univer&s;i|ties at home, he was &s;ent abroad on his travels, but never got
further than <HI>Paris</HI>; where having lo&s;t a con&s;iderable bet of four
to one concerning the taking a town in <HI>Flanders,</HI> he was obliged to

became univer|&s;ally known by frequenting every gaming-table and attend|ing
every hor&s;e-race in the kingdom. He fir&s;t reduced betting into an art, and
made <HI>White</HI>'s the grand market for wagers. He is at length &s;uch an
adept in this art, that whatever turn things take, he can never lo&s;e: this he
has effected by what he has taught the world to call <HI>hedging a bet.</HI>
There is &s;carce an election in the kingdom which will not end to his
advantage; and he has lately &s;ent over commi&s;&s;ions to <HI>Paris</HI> to
take up bets on the recall of the parliament. He was the fir&s;t that &s;truck
out the above|mentioned practice of pitting, in which he is &s;o thoroughly
ver&s;ed, that the death of every per&s;on of quality may be &s;aid to bring
him a legacy; and he has &s;o contrived the bets on his own life, that, live or
die, the odds are in his favour.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_YOUR la&s;t week's paper on the &s;ubject of Bets put me in
mind of an extract I lately met with in &s;ome news papers, from the "Life of
Pope <HI>Sixtus</HI> the Fifth, written by Mr. <HI>Farnworth.</HI>" The
pa&s;&s;age is as follows.</P>
<Q>IT was reported in <HI>Rome,</HI> that <HI>Drake</HI> had
taken and plundered St. <HI>Domingo</HI> in <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> and carried
off an immen&s;e booty. This account came in a private letter to <HI>Paul
Secchi,</HI> a very con&s;iderable merchant in the city, who had large concerns
in tho&s;e parts, which he had in&s;ured. Upon receiving this news, he &s;ent
for the in&s;urer <HI>Sam&s;on</HI> <PB N="92" REF="97"> <HI>Ceneda,</HI> a
Jew, and acquainted him with it. The Jew, who&s;e intere&s;t it was to have
&s;uch a report thought fal&s;e, gave many rea&s;ons why it could not
po&s;&s;ibly be true; and at la&s;t worked him&s;elf up into &s;uch a
pa&s;&s;ion, that he &s;aid I'll lay you a pound of my fle&s;h it is a lye.
<HI>Secchi,</HI> who was of a fiery hot temper, replied, I'll lay you a
thou&s;and crowns again&s;t a pound of your fle&s;h, that it is true. The Jew
accepted the wager, and articles were immediately ex|ecuted betwixt them, That
if <HI>Secchi</HI> won, he &s;hould him|&s;elf cut the fle&s;h with a &s;harp
knife from whatever part of the Jew's body he plea&s;ed. The truth of the
account was &s;oon confirmed; and the Jew was almo&s;t di&s;tracted when he was
informed that <HI>Secchi</HI> had &s;olemnly &s;worn he would compel him to the
exact literal performance of his contract. A report of this tran&s;action was
brought to the Pope, who &s;ent for the parties, and being informed of the
whole affair, &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">"When contracts are made, it is ju&s;t they
&s;hould be fulfilled, as this &s;hall. Take a knife therefore,
<HI>Secchi,</HI> and cut a pound of fle&s;h from any part you plea&s;e of the
Jew's body. We advi&s;e you however to be very careful; for if you cut but a
&s;cruple more or le&s;s than your due, you &s;hall certainly be
hanged."</Q></Q>
<P>WHAT induced me to trouble you with this is a remark made by
the editor, 
<Q REND="inline">"that the &s;cene between <HI>Shylock</HI> and
<HI>Antonio</HI> in the <HI>Merchant of Venice</HI> is borrowed from this
&s;tory."</Q> I &s;hould perhaps have acquie&s;ced in this notion, if I had not
&s;een a note in the "Ob&s;ervations on <HI>Spen&s;er's Faerie Queene</HI>"
ju&s;t publi&s;hed by Mr. <HI>T. Warton of Trinity College,</HI> where He has
plainly di&s;covered the real &s;ource from which <HI>Shake&s;pere</HI> drew
his fable, which He informs us is founded upon an ancient ballad. The admirers
of <HI>Shake&s;pere</HI> are obliged to him for this curious di&s;covery; but
as Mr. <HI>Warton</HI> has only given &s;ome extracts, they would undoubtedly
be glad to &s;ee the whole. This Ballad is mo&s;t probably no where to be met
with, but in the <HI>A&s;hmolean Mu&s;aeum</HI> in this Univer&s;ity, where it
is pre&s;erved by that famous Antiquary <HI>Anthony &agrave; Wood:</HI> I have
therefore &s;ent you a faithful tran|&s;cript <PB N="93" REF="98"> of it; and
you will agree with me that it will do you more credit, as a CONNOISSEUR, to
draw this hidden trea|&s;ure into light, than if you had di&s;covered an
<HI>Otho</HI> or a <HI>Niger.</HI></P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Shewing the crueltie of GERNUTUS a JEWE, who
lending to a marchant an hundred crownes, would have a pound of his fle&s;he,
becau&s;e he could not pay him at the time appointed.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<LG>
<L>IN <HI>Venice</HI> town not long agoe</L>
<L>A cruel Jew did dwell,</L>
<L>Which lived all on u&s;urie,</L>
<L>As Italian writers tell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Gernutus</HI> called was the Jew,</L>
<L>Which never thought to die,</L>
<L>Nor never yet did any good</L>
<L>To them in &s;treets that lye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His life was like a barrow hogge,</L>
<L>That liveth many a day,</L>
<L>Yet never once doth any good,</L>
<L>Untill men will him &s;lay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Or like a filthy heap of dung,</L>
<L>That lyeth in a hoord;</L>
<L>Which never can doe any good,</L>
<L>Till it be &s;pread abroad.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So fares it with this U&s;urer,</L>
<L>He cannot &s;leep in re&s;t,</L>
<L>For fear the theefe doth him pur&s;ue,</L>
<L>To pluck him from his ne&s;t.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His heart doth thinke on many a wile,</L>
<L>How to deceive the poore;</L>
<L>His mouth is almo&s;t full of mucke,</L>
<L>Yet &s;till he gapes for more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His wife mu&s;t lend a &s;hilling,</L>
<L>For every weeke a penny,</L>
<L>Yet bring a pledge that's double worth,</L>
<L>If that you will have any.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And &s;ee (likewi&s;e) you keepe your day,</L>
<L>Or el&s;e you loo&s;e it all:</L>
<L>This was the living of his wife,</L>
<L>Her cow &s;he doth it call.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Within that citie dwelt that time</L>
<L>A merchant of great fame,</L>
<L>Which being di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in his need,</L>
<L>Unto <HI>Gernutus</HI> came:</L>
</LG>

<L>De&s;iring him to &s;tand his friend,</L>

<L>And pledges he &s;hould have:</L>
<L>No (qd. the Jew with fleering lookers)</L>
<L>Sir a&s;ke what you will have.</L>
</LG>

<L>No penny for the loane of it</L>
<L>For one yeere you &s;hall pay;</L>

<L>You &s;hall make me a bond (quoth he)</L>

<P>IT will be proper to &s;ubjoin what the ingenious Mr.
<HI>Warton</HI> has ob&s;erved upon this &s;ubject.&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">'It may be objected, &s;ays he, that this
ballad might have been <PB N="95" REF="100"> written after, and copied from,
<HI>Shake&s;pere</HI>'s play. But if that had been the ca&s;e, it is mo&s;t
likely, that the author would have pre&s;erved <HI>Shake&s;pere</HI>'s name of
<HI>Shylock</HI> for the Jew; and nothing is more likely, than that
<HI>Shake&s;pere</HI> in copying from this ballad, &s;hould alter the name from
<HI>Gernu|tus</HI> to one more Jewi&s;h. Another argument is, that our ballad
has the air of a narrative written before <HI>Shake&s;pere</HI>'s play; I mean,
that, if it had been written after the play, it would have been much more full
and circum&s;tantial: At pre&s;ent, it has too much the nakedne&s;s of an
original.'</Q></P>
<P>IT would indeed be ab&s;urd to think that this ballad was
taken from <HI>Shake&s;pere</HI>'s play, as they differ in the mo&s;t
e&s;&s;en|tial circum&s;tances. The &s;um borrowed is in the former three
thou&s;and ducats, in the latter an hundred crowns: the time limited for
payment in the one is only three months, in the other a year and a day: In the
play the merchant's motive for borrowing, (which is finely imagined by
<HI>Shake&s;pere,</HI> and is conducive to the general plot,) is not on account
of his own nece&s;&s;ities, but for the &s;ervice of his friend. To th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> we may add, that the clo&s;e of the &s;tory is finely
height|ened by <HI>Shake&s;pere.</HI> A mere copyi&s;t, &s;uch as we may
&s;uppo&s;e a balladmonger, would not have given him&s;elf the trouble to alter
circum&s;tances: at lea&s;t he would not have changed them &s;o much for the
wor&s;e. But this matter &s;eems to be placed out of all doubt by the fir&s;t
&s;tanza of the ballad, which in|forms us that the &s;tory was taken from
&s;ome Italian novel. 
<Q REND="inline">'Thus much therefore is certain, (as Mr.
<HI>Warton</HI> ob&s;erves) that <HI>Shake&s;pere</HI> either copied from that
Italian novel, or from this ballad: Now we have no tran&s;lation, I pre&s;ume,
of &s;uch a novel into Engli&s;h; if then it be granted that
<HI>Shake&s;pere</HI> generally took his Italian &s;tories from their
En|gli&s;h tran&s;lations, and that the arguments above, concerning the prior
antiquity of this ballad are true, it will follow that <HI>Shake&s;pere</HI>
copied from this ballad.'</Q></P>
<P>UPON the whole it is very likely that the <HI>Italian</HI>
novel, upon which this ballad &s;eems founded, took its ri&s;e (with an 
<PB N="96" REF="101"> inver&s;ion of the circum&s;tances) from the
abovementioned &s;tory in "The Life of Pope <HI>Sixtus</HI> the Fifth," the
memory of which mu&s;t have been then recent. I &s;hould be glad if any of your
readers can give any further light into this affair, and, if po&s;&s;ible,
acquaint the Public, from whence <HI>Shake&s;pere</HI> borrowed the other part
of his fable concerning <HI>Portia and the Ca&s;kets</HI>; which it is more
than probable is drawn from &s;ome other novel well known in his time.</P>
<P>I CANNOT conclude without remarking with what art and judgment
<HI>Shake&s;pere</HI> have wove together the&s;e different &s;tories of the
<HI>Jew,</HI> and the <HI>Ca&s;kets</HI>; from both which he has form|ed one
general fable, without having recour&s;e to the &s;tale artifice of eking out a
barren &s;ubject with impertinent un|derplots.</P>

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THOUGH many hi&s;torians have de&s;cribed the City of
<HI>London</HI> (in which we may in|clude <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI>) with great
accuracy, yet they have not &s;et it out in the full light, which at pre&s;ent
it de&s;erves. They have not di&s;tingui&s;hed it as an Univer&s;ity.
<HI>Paris</HI> is an Univer&s;ity, <HI>Dublin</HI> is an Univer&s;ity, even
<HI>Mo&s;cow</HI> is an Univer&s;ity. But <HI>London</HI> has not yet been
honoured with that Title. I will allow our Metropolis to have been intended
originally, only as a City of Trade, and I will farther own that &s;carce any
Sciences, except &s;uch as were purely mercantile, were cultivated in it 'till
within the&s;e la&s;t thirty years; but from <PB N="98" REF="103"> period of
time, I may &s;ay an whole army, as it were, of Arts and Sciences have marched
amicably in upon us, and have fixed them&s;elves as auxiliaries to our
Capitol.</P>
<P>THE four greater faculties, I mean Theology, Law, Me|dicine,
and Philo&s;ophy, which are taught in other Univer|&s;ities, are in their
highe&s;t perfection here. The pro&s;perity of the fir&s;t may be &s;een by the
crouded churches every Sun|day, and the di&s;cipline of the &s;econd by the
numberle&s;s young Students who con&s;tantly dine in their re&s;pective halls
at the &s;everal inns of court. The&s;e two faculties have of late received
con&s;iderable improvements, but particularly that of Theology, as is
manife&s;t from &s;everal new and a&s;to|ni&s;hing opinions which have been
&s;tarted among us. There have ri&s;en, within the&s;e few years, very numerous
tribes of Methodi&s;ts, Moravians, Middletonians, Hutchin&s;onians, &amp;c. in
a word our &s;ects are multiplied to &s;uch an infinite de|gree, that (as
<HI>Voltaire</HI> has before ob&s;erved) every Man may now go to heaven his own
way. Can the Divinity Schools boa&s;t &s;uch &s;ound doctrine as the Foundery
in <HI>Moorfields?</HI> or were ever fellows of colleges &s;uch adepts in
Matri|mony as the reverend doctors of the <HI>Fleet,</HI> or the primate of
<HI>May-Fair?</HI></P>
<P>THE theory of Medicine may undoubtedly be taught at
<HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Cambridge</HI> in a tolerable manner, but the art
it&s;elf can only be learnt, where it flouri&s;hes, at <HI>London.</HI> Do not
our daily papers give us a longer li&s;t of medicines than are contained in any
of the Di&s;pen&s;atories? And are we not con&s;tantly told of &s;urprizing
antidotes, certain cures, and never failing remedies for every complaint, and
are not each of the&s;e &s;pecifies equally efficacious in one di&s;temper as
another, from the grand re&s;torative elixir of life down to the in&s;allible
corn &s;alve? With what plea&s;ure and admiration <PB N="99" REF="104"> have I
beheld the <HI>Machaon</HI> of our times Dr. <HI>Richard Rock</HI>
di&s;pen&s;ing from his one-hor&s;e-chai&s;e his cathartic antivene|real
electuary, his itch powder, and his quinte&s;&s;ence of vi|pers! It may be
a&s;ked, is he a graduate? Is he a regular phy&s;ician? no, he is &s;uperior to
regularity. He de&s;pi&s;es the formality of academical degrees. He &s;tiles
him&s;elf M. L. He is a London Phy&s;ician, or as <HI>Moliere</HI> would
expre&s;s it, <HI>C' e&s;t un Medecin de Londres.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER Medicine let us con&s;ider Logic. How is that mo&s;t
u&s;eful art taught in the two Univer&s;ities? Is it not clogged with &s;uch
barbarous terms, as tend to puzzle and confound, rather than enlighten or
direct the under&s;tanding? Is it not taught in a dead, I had almo&s;t &s;aid
in a popi&s;h Tongue? Is it not overrun with dry di&s;tinctions, and
u&s;ele&s;s &s;ubtleties? Where then is it to be learnt in all the purity of
rea&s;on, and the dignity of language? Neither at <HI>Oxford</HI> nor at
<HI>Cambridge,</HI> but at the Robin Hood Alehou&s;e in Butcher Row, near
Temple Bar.</P>
<P>FROM Logic let us proceed to Eloquence: And let us
ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;s that neither of our Univer&s;ities can boa&s;t an
orator equal to the renown'd <HI>Henley.</HI> Has he not all the qualifications
required by <HI>Tully</HI> in a complete Orator? Has he not been followed by
the greate&s;t men of the nation? Yet has this mode&s;t divine never derived
any title to him&s;elf from his own rhetoric, except &s;uch an one as his
extraordi|nary elocution naturally be&s;towed upon him. Might he not have
called him&s;elf <HI>Pre&s;ident</HI> of the Butchers? <HI>Dean</HI> of
Marrowbones and Cleavers? or <HI>Warden</HI> of <HI>Clare Market?</HI>
certainly he might. Therefore if it were for his &s;ake only, in my humble
opinion, London ought immediately to a&s;&s;ume the title of an Univer&s;ity;
and the Butchers of Clare Market, who have &s;o con&s;tantly attended Mr.
<HI>Henley</HI>'s Lectures, ought to be pre&s;ented with honorary degrees.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="105">I KNOW not what preten&s;ions the
Univer&s;ities may have had originally to adopt <HI>Mu&s;ic</HI> among the
re&s;t of their Sciences: perhaps they have a&s;&s;umed a right of be&s;towing
Degrees in <HI>Mu&s;ic,</HI> from their being called the &s;eats of the
Mu&s;es; as it is well known that <HI>Apollo</HI> was a fidler as well as a
poet and phy&s;ician; and the Mu&s;es are &s;aid to have delighted in fidling
and piping. The young &s;tudents, I am told, of either Univer&s;ity are more
ambitious to excel in this &s;cience than any other, and &s;pend mo&s;t of
their time in the &s;tudy of the <HI>Gamut:</HI> but their knowledge in
<HI>Har|monics</HI> is &s;eldom carried farther than <HI>I love Sue,</HI> or
<HI>Ally Croker.</HI> In this point <HI>London</HI> has undoubtedly a better
title to be called an Univer&s;ity. Did <HI>Oxford</HI> or <HI>Cambridge</HI>
ever produce an Opera, though they have the advantage of languages &s;o very
little known as the <HI>Greek</HI> and even <HI>Hebrew</HI> to compo&s;e in?
Had ever any of their profe&s;&s;ors the lea&s;t idea of a Burletta? or are any
of their mo&s;t &s;ublime anthems half &s;o ravi&s;hing as <HI>Foote's
Minuet</HI> from the hand-organ of the little <HI>Savoyard Dutche&s;s?</HI> Are
tho&s;e cla&s;&s;ical in&s;truments the <HI>Doric Lute,</HI> the
<HI>Syrinx,</HI> or the <HI>Fi&s;tula,</HI> to be compared to the melody of the
<HI>Wooden Spoons,</HI> the <HI>Jews Harp</HI> and <HI>Salt-Box</HI> at Mrs.
<HI>Midnight</HI>'s?</P>
<P>BUT there is no doctrines more forcibly inculcated among us
than tho&s;e of <HI>Ethics,</HI> or moral Philo&s;ophy. What are the precepts
of <HI>Plato, Epictetus,</HI> or <HI>Tully</HI> in compari&s;on to the moral
le&s;&s;ons delivered by our periodical writers? And are not you, Mr. TOWN, a
wi&s;er man than <HI>Socrates?</HI> But the age is more particularly indebted,
for it's pre&s;ent uni|ver&s;al purity of manners, to tho&s;e excellent rules
for the conduct of life contained in our modern novels. From the&s;e moral
works might be compiled an entire new &s;y&s;tem of Ethics, far &s;uperior to
the exploded notions of mu&s;ty <HI>Aca|demics,</HI> and adapted to the
practi&s;e of the pre&s;ent times. <PB N="101" REF="106"> <HI>Cato,</HI> we are
told, commended a young man who he &s;aw coming out of the publick &s;tews,
becau&s;e he imagined it might pre&s;erve him from the crime of adultery; and
the <HI>Spartans</HI> u&s;ed to make their &s;laves drunk in the pre&s;ence of
their youth, that they might be deterred from the like debaucheries. For the
&s;ame rea&s;ons we may &s;uppo&s;e that our taverns and bagnios are &s;o much
frequented by our young people, and in this light we may fairly con&s;ider them
as &s;o many <HI>&s;chools of Moral Philo&s;ophy.</HI></P>
<P>IF we are willing to turn our thoughts towards Expe|rimental
Philo&s;ophy, can the &s;everal Univer&s;ities of the whole world produce
&s;uch a variety of in&s;truments, &s;o ju|diciou&s;ly collected, for
a&s;tronomical, geographical, and all other &s;cientific ob&s;ervations, as are
to be &s;een in the two amazing repo&s;itories of Mr. Profe&s;&s;or
<HI>Deard</HI> in the <HI>Strand,</HI> and of Mr. Profe&s;&s;or Ru&s;&s;el at
<HI>Charing Cro&s;s?</HI> It were endle&s;s to enumerate particulars; but I
cannot help ta|king notice of tho&s;e elegant little portable tele&s;copes,
that are made u&s;e of in all public places; by which it is evident that even
our fine ladies and gentlemen are become pro|ficients in <HI>Optics.</HI></P>
<P>THE Univer&s;ities &s;eem to pride them&s;elves greatly on
their choice collections of curious and invaluable trifles, which are there
pre&s;erved, only becau&s;e they were not thought worth pre&s;erving any where
el&s;e. But is the <HI>A&s;h|molean</HI> collection of rarities comparable to
the nicknackatory of Mr. <HI>Pinchbeck?</HI> or are any of their Mu&s;aeums
&s;tored with &s;uch precious curio&s;ities, as are frequently &s;een in Mr.
<HI>Langford</HI>'s Auction-Room? Strangers, who think it worth while to go
&s;o far as <HI>Oxford</HI> or <HI>Cambridge</HI> to &s;ee &s;ights, may
&s;urely meet with as much &s;atisfaction at <HI>London.</HI> Are the two
little Pigmies &s;triking a clock at <HI>Car&s;ax</HI> within 
<PB N="102" REF="107"> any degree of compari&s;on with the two noble Giants at
St. <HI>Dun&s;tan's</HI> church in <HI>Fleet Street</HI>; to &s;ay nothing of
their enormous brethren at <HI>Guildhall?</HI> Are any of the College Halls in
either of the Univer&s;ities &s;o magnificent as tho&s;e belonging to our
wor&s;hipful companies? or can the Theatre at <HI>Oxford,</HI> or the
Senate-hou&s;e at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> vie with that &s;tupendous piece of
architecture the Man&s;ion Hou&s;e, &s;et apart for our Chancellor the Lord
Mayor? It may be al|ledged perhaps that the&s;e are trifling examples of
&s;uperiority, which the younger &s;i&s;ter bears over her two elder; but at
the &s;ame time it cannot be denied, that &s;he excells them both even in the
minutiae of learning and antiquity.</P>
<P>I MUST confe&s;s that Hydraulics, or the motion of Fluids,
&s;eem to be taught exactly in the &s;ame manner, and with the &s;ame degree of
knowledge, in <HI>London</HI> as in <HI>Oxford</HI> or <HI>Cambridge.</HI> The
gla&s;s Tubes, and the Syphons, are formed very much in the &s;ame &s;hape and
fa&s;hion. The great hydro&s;tatical law, 
<Q REND="inline">"That all fluids gravitate in <HI>proprio
loco,</HI>"</Q> is proved by the &s;ame kind of experiments. The &s;everal
&s;tudents, of whatever age or &s;tation, vie with each other in an unwearied
application, and a con&s;tant attendance to this branch of mixed Mathematics.
The Profe&s;&s;ors in each of the three Univer&s;ities, are confe&s;&s;edly
very great men: but I hope I may be forgiven if I wi&s;h to &s;ee my friend Mr.
<HI>Ryan,</HI> Pre&s;ident of the <HI>King's Arms</HI> in <HI>Pall Mall,</HI>

<P>_AN information was the other day laid before a magi&s;trate by
a Fellow of the Society of Antiquarians again&s;t one of his brethren for a
robbery. The pro&s;ecutor depo&s;ed upon oath, that the other called upon him
to &s;ee his collection of medals, and took an opportunity of &s;tealing a
leather pur&s;e formerly belonging to the cele|brated <HI>Tom Hearne,</HI> in
which were contained, (be&s;ides an antique piece of copper-money, place, date,
name, figure, and value unknown) a pair of breeches of <HI>Oliver
Cromwell,</HI> a <HI>Denarius</HI> of <HI>Trajan</HI> worth fifty &s;hillings,
and a Queen <HI>Anne</HI>'s farthing value five pounds. He was with much ado
di&s;&s;uaded from carrying on his &s;uit, as the magi&s;trate 
<PB N="104" REF="109"> convinced him, that however highly he might rate his own
trea&s;ures, a jury, who were no <HI>Virtuo&s;i,</HI> would con|&s;ider a
farthing merely as a farthing, and look upon a copper coin of a <HI>Roman
Emperor</HI> as no better than a King <HI>George</HI>'s half-penny.</P>
<P>I CANNOT indeed, without great concern, as a CON|NOISSEUR,
reflect on the known di&s;hone&s;ty of my learned brethren. Their &s;candalous
practi&s;es, wherever their darling pa&s;&s;ion is intere&s;ted, are too
notorious to be denied. The moment they conceive a love for rarities and
antiques, their &s;trict notions of honour di&s;appear; and Ta&s;te, the more
it e&s;tabli&s;hes their veneration for <HI>Virt&ugrave;,</HI> the more
certainly de&s;troys their integrity; as ru&s;t enhances the value of an old
coin by eating up the figure and in&s;cription.</P>
<P>MOST people are ma&s;ters of a kind of Logic, by which they
argue their con&s;ciences to &s;leep, and acquit them&s;elves of doing what is
wrong. The country '&s;quire, of confirmed hone&s;ty in all other re&s;pects,
thinks it very fair to over|reach you in the &s;ale of a hor&s;e; the man of
plea&s;ure, who would &s;corn to pick your pocket, or &s;top you on the road,
regards it rather as gallantry than ba&s;ene&s;s to intrigue with your wife or
daughter; while the pick-pocket and highwayman value them&s;elves on their
honour in being true to the gang. In the &s;ame manner the <HI>Virtuo&s;o</HI>
does not look on his thefts as real acts of felony, but while he owns that he
would take any pains to &s;teal an old ru&s;ty piece of bra&s;s, boa&s;ts that
you may &s;afely tru&s;t him with untold gold: though he would break open your
cabinet for a &s;hell or a butterfly, he would not attempt to force your
e&s;critoire or your &s;trong box; nor would he offer the lea&s;t violence to
your wife or daughter, though perhaps he would run away with the little finger
of the <HI>Venus de Medicis.</HI> <PB N="105" REF="110"> Upon the&s;e
principles he proceeds, and lays hold of all opportunities to increa&s;e his
collection of rarities: and as <HI>Mahomet</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed his religion by
the &s;word, the <HI>Connoi&s;&s;eur</HI> enlarges his Mu&s;aeum, and adds to
his &s;tore of knowledge, by fraud and petty larceny.</P>
<P>IF the libraries and cabinets of the curious were, like the
peacock in the fable, to be &s;tripped of their borrowed ornaments, we &s;hould
in many &s;ee nothing but bare &s;helves and empty drawers. I know a medali&s;t
who at fir&s;t &s;et up with little more than a paltry &s;eries of Engli&s;h
coins &s;ince the Reformation, which he had the good luck to pick up at their
intrin&s;ic value. By a pliant u&s;e of his fingers he &s;oon became
po&s;&s;e&s;t of mo&s;t of the <HI>Traders,</HI> and by the &s;ame &s;light of
hand he in a &s;hort time after made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of great part of the
<HI>Cae&s;ars.</HI> He was once taken up for coining; a forge, a crucible, and
&s;everal dies being found in his cellar: but he was acquitted, as there was no
law which made it high-trea&s;on to counterfeit the image of a
<HI>Tiberius</HI> or a <HI>Nero</HI>; and the coin which he imitated was
current only among <HI>Virtuo&s;os.</HI></P>
<P>I REMEMBER another, who picqued him&s;elf on his collection of
&s;carce editions and original manu&s;cripts, mo&s;t of which he had purloined
from the libraries of others. He was continually borrowing books of his
acquaintance, with a re&s;olution never to return them. He would &s;end in a
great hurry for a particular edition, which he wanted to con&s;ult only for a
moment; but when it was a&s;ked for again, he was not at home, or he had lent
it to another, or he had lo&s;t it, or he could not find it; and &s;ometimes he
would not &s;cruple to &s;wear, that he had him&s;elf delivered it into the
owner's hands. He would frequently &s;poil a &s;et by &s;tealing a volume, and
then purcha&s;e the re&s;t for <PB N="106" REF="111"> a trifle. After his death
his library was &s;old by auction; and many of his friends bought up their own
books at an exorbitant price.</P>
<P>A THOROUGHBRED <HI>Virtuo&s;o</HI> will &s;urmount all
&s;cruples of con&s;cience, or encounter any danger to &s;erve his pur|po&s;e.
Mo&s;t of them are chiefly attached to &s;ome particular branch of knowledge,
but I remember one who was pa&s;&s;ionately fond of every part of
<HI>Virt&ugrave;.</HI> At one time, when he could find no other way of carrying
off a medal, he run the ri&s;k of being choaked by &s;wallowing it, and at
another broke his leg in &s;caling a garden wall for a tulip|root. But nothing
gave him &s;o much trouble and diffi|culty as the taking away pictures and
antient marbles; which being heavy and unwieldy, he often endangered his life
to gratify his curio&s;ity. He was once locked up all night in the Duke of
<HI>Tu&s;cany</HI>'s gallery, where he took out an original painting of
<HI>Raphael,</HI> and dextrou&s;ly placed a copy of it in the frame. At
<HI>Venice</HI> he turned Roman Catholic, and became a Je&s;uit, in order to
get admittance into a convent, from whence he &s;tole a fine head of
<HI>Ignatius Loyola</HI>; and at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> he had almo&s;t
formed a re|&s;olution of qualifying him&s;elf for the Seraglio, that he might
find means to carry off a picture of the Grand Signior's chief
mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>THE general di&s;hone&s;ty of <HI>Connoi&s;&s;eurs</HI> is
indeed &s;o well known, that the &s;tricte&s;t precaution is taken to guard
a|gain&s;t it. Medals are &s;ecured under lock and key, pictures &s;crewed to
the walls, and books chained to the &s;helves; yet cabinets, galleries, and
libraries are continually plundered. Many of the maimed &s;tatues at
<HI>Rome</HI> perhaps owe their pre&s;ent ruinous condition to the depredations
made on them by <HI>Virtuo&s;os:</HI> the head of <HI>Henry</HI> the Fifth 
<PB N="107" REF="112"> in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter Abby</HI> was in all probability
&s;tolen by a <HI>Connoi&s;&s;eur</HI>; and I know one who has at different
times pilfered a great part of Queen <HI>Catherine</HI>'s bones, and hopes in a
little while to be ma&s;ter of the whole &s;keleton. This gentleman has been
detected in &s;o many little thefts, that he has for &s;everal years pa&s;t
been refu&s;ed admittance into the Mu&s;aeums of the curious; and he is lately
gone abroad with a de&s;ign upon the ancient <HI>Greek</HI> manu&s;cripts
lately di&s;covered at <HI>Herculaneum.</HI></P>
<P>IT may &s;eem &s;urprizing that the&s;e gentlemen &s;hould have
hitherto been &s;uffered to e&s;cape unpuni&s;hed for their repeated thefts,
and that a <HI>Virtuo&s;o</HI> who robs you of an <HI>Unic</HI> of
ine&s;timable value &s;hould even glory in the action, while a poor dog who
picks your pocket of &s;ixpence &s;hall be hanged for it. What a &s;hocking
di&s;grace would be brought upon Ta&s;te, &s;hould we ever &s;ee the dying
&s;peech, confe&s;&s;ion, and behaviour of a <HI>Connoi&s;&s;eur</HI> related
in the Account of Malefactors by the Ordinary of <HI>Newgate!</HI> Such an
accident would doubtle&s;s bring the &s;tudy of <HI>Virt&ugrave;</HI> into
&s;till more contempt among the ignorant, when they found that it only brought
a man to the gallows; as the country fellow, when he &s;aw an attorney &s;tand
in the pillory for forgery, &s;hook his head, and cried, 
<Q REND="inline">"Ay, this comes of your writing and
reading."</Q> It were perhaps worthy the con&s;ideration of the legi&s;lature
to devi&s;e &s;ome puni&s;h|ment for the&s;e offenders, which &s;hould bear
&s;ome analogy with their crimes; and as common malefactors are delivered to
the &s;urgeons to be anatomized, I would propo&s;e that a
<HI>Connoi&s;&s;eur</HI> &s;hould be made into a Mummy, and pre&s;erved in the
Hall of the Royal Society, for the terror and admiration of his brethren.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="113">I SHALL conclude this paper with the
relation of a circum&s;tance which fell within my own knowledge when I was
abroad, and in which I declined a glorious opportu|nity of &s;ignalizing
my&s;elf as a <HI>Connoi&s;&s;eur.</HI> While I was at <HI>Rome</HI> a young
phy&s;ician of our party, who was eaten up with <HI>Virt&ugrave;,</HI> made a
&s;erious propo&s;al to us of breaking into St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s by night, and
taking away the famous painting over the altar-piece. As I had not quite
Ta&s;te enough to come at once into his &s;cheme, I could not help objecting to
him that it was a robbery. <HI>Poh,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>it is a mo&s;t
exqui&s;ite picture!</HI>&mdash;Ay, but it is not only a robbery, but
&s;acrilege.&mdash;<HI>Oh it is a mo&s;t charming piece!</HI>&mdash;Zouns,

<P>_I HAVE &s;elected the following letters from a great number
which I have lately been favoured with from unknown corre&s;pon|dents; and as
they both relate nearly to the &s;ame &s;ubject, I &s;hall without further
preface &s;ubmit them to the public.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN you was got into <HI>White</HI>'s, I was in hopes that
you would not have confin'd your&s;elf merely to the gaming-table, but have
given us an account of the entertainment at their ordinaries. A bill of fare
from thence would have been full as diverting to your readers 
<PB N="110" REF="115"> as the laws of the game, or a li&s;t of their bets.
The&s;e gen|tlemen, we are told, are no le&s;s adepts in the &s;cience of
Eating than of Gaming; and as <HI>Hoyle</HI> has reduc'd the latter into a new
and complete &s;y&s;tem, I could wi&s;h that their cook (who to be &s;ure is a
<HI>Frenchman</HI>) would al&s;o oblige the world by a treati&s;e on the Art
and My&s;tery of Sauces.</P>
<P>INDEED, Mr. TOWN, it &s;urprizes me that you have &s;o long
neglected to make &s;ome reflections on the Diet of this great city. Dr.
<HI>Martin Li&s;ter,</HI> who was univer&s;ally allowed to be a great
<HI>Connoi&s;&s;eur,</HI> and publi&s;hed &s;everal learned trea|ti&s;es upon
cockle-&s;hells, did not think it beneath him to comment on the works of
<HI>Apicius Caelius,</HI> who had collected together many valuable receipts in
cookery, as practi&s;ed by the <HI>Romans.</HI> If you would pre&s;erve your
papers from the indignity of covering brea&s;ts of veal, or wrapping up outlets
<HI>&agrave; la Maintenon,</HI> I would advi&s;e you to lard them now and then
with the ragouts of <HI>Heliogabalus,</HI> or a parallel between our modern
&s;oups and the <HI>Lacedaemonian</HI> black broth. Your works might then be
univer&s;ally read, from the mi&s;tre&s;s in the parlour down to the cookmaid
and &s;cullion.</P>
<P>IT is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for people of all tempers,
com|plexions, per&s;ua&s;ions, habits and &s;tations of life, however they may
differ in other particulars, to concur in the grand article of Eating; and as
the humours of the body ari&s;e from the food we take in, the di&s;po&s;itions
of the mind &s;eem to bear an equal re&s;emblance to our places of
refre&s;hment. You have already taken a review of our &s;everal
coffee-hou&s;es; and I wi&s;h you would proceed to delineate the different
cha|racters that are to be found in our taverns and chop-hou&s;es. A friend of
mine always judges of a man of ta&s;te and fa&s;hion, by a&s;king who is his
peruke-maker, or his taylor? Upon the &s;ame principles, when I would form a
ju&s;t opinion <PB N="111" REF="116"> any man's temper and inclinations, I
always enquire, where does he dine?</P>
<P>THE difference between the taverns near St. <HI>James</HI>'s
and tho&s;e about the <HI>'Change</HI> con&s;i&s;ts not &s;o much in the
co&s;tli|ne&s;s as the &s;ub&s;tance of their viands. The round-bellied
alderman, who breathes the foggy air of the city, requires a more &s;olid diet
than the high kick&s;haws of our meagre per&s;ons of quality. My Lord, or Sir
<HI>John,</HI> after having whiled away an hour or two at the
Parliament-hou&s;e, drive to the <HI>Star and Garter</HI> to regale on
Macaroni, or pid|dle with an Ortolan; while the merchant, who has plodded all
the morning in the Alley, &s;its down to a Turtle-Fea&s;t at the <HI>Crown</HI>
or the <HI>King's Arms,</HI> and crams him&s;elf with Calipa&s;h and Calipee.
As the city taverns are appropriated to men of bu&s;ine&s;s, who drive bargains
for thou&s;ands over their morning's gill, the taverns about the court are
gene|rally filled with an in&s;ipid race of mortals who have nothing to do.
Among the&s;e you may &s;ee mo&s;t of our young men of fa&s;hion and young
officers of the guards, who meet at the&s;e places to &s;hew the elegance of
their ta&s;te by the expen&s;ivene&s;s of their dinner; and I know an En&s;ign
with &s;carce any income but his commi&s;&s;ion, who prides him|&s;elf on
keeping the be&s;t company, and throws down more than a week's pay for his
reckoning.</P>
<P>THE taverns about the purlieus of <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> are
de|dicated to <HI>Venus</HI> as well as <HI>Ceres</HI> and <HI>Liber</HI>; and
you may frequently &s;ee the jolly me&s;&s;mates of both &s;exes go in and come
out in couples, like the clean and unclean bea&s;ts in <HI>Noah</HI>'s ark.
The&s;e hou&s;es are equally indebted for their &s;upport to the Cook and that
worthy per&s;onage whom they have dignified with the title of Pimp. The&s;e
gentlemen contrive to play into each other's hands: The fir&s;t by his 
<PB N="112" REF="117"> high &s;oups and rich &s;auces prepares the way for the
occu|pation of the other, who having reduced the patient by a proper exerci&s;e
of his art, returns him back again to go through the &s;ame regimen as before.
We may therefore &s;uppo&s;e that the culinary arts are no le&s;s &s;tudied
here than at <HI>White</HI>'s or <HI>Pontac</HI>'s. True geniu&s;es in Eating
will con|tinually &s;trike out new improvements; but I dare &s;ay neither
<HI>Braund</HI> nor <HI>Lebeck</HI> ever made up a more extraordinary di&s;h
than I once remember at the <HI>Ca&s;tle.</HI> Some bloods being in company
with a celebrated <HI>fille de joye,</HI> one of them pulled off her &s;hoe,
and in exce&s;s of gallantry filled it with Champagne, and drank it off to her
health: in this de|licious draught he was immediately pledged by the re&s;t;
and then, to carry the compliment &s;till further, he ordered it to be dre&s;t,
and &s;erved up for &s;upper. The cook &s;et him|&s;elf &s;eriou&s;ly to work
upon it: He pulled the upper part (which was of dama&s;k) into fine &s;hreds,
and to&s;&s;ed it up in a ragout; minced the &s;ole; cut the wooden heel into
very thin &s;lices, fried them in butter, and placed them round the di&s;h for
garni&s;h. The company, you may be &s;ure, te&s;ti|fied their affection for the
lady by eating very heartily of this exqui&s;ite <HI>impromptu</HI>; and as
this tran&s;action happened ju&s;t after the <HI>French</HI> King had taken a
cobler's daughter for his mi&s;tre&s;s, <HI>Tom Pierce</HI> (who has the
&s;tile as well as art of a <HI>French</HI> cook) in his bill politely called
it, in honour of her name, <HI>De &s;oulier &aacute; la Murphy.</HI></P>
<P>TAVERNS, Mr. TOWN, &s;eem contrived for the pro|moting of
luxury; while the humbler Chop-hou&s;es are de|&s;igned only to &s;atisfy the
ordinary cravings of nature. Yet at the&s;e you may meet with a variety of
characters: at <HI>Dolly</HI>'s and <HI>Hor&s;eman</HI>'s you commonly &s;ee
the hearty lovers of a beef-&s;teak and gill ale; and at <HI>Betty</HI>'s and
the chop|hou&s;es about the Inns of Court, a pretty maid is as inviting 
<PB N="113" REF="118"> as the provi&s;ions. In the&s;e common refectories you
may always find the jemmy attorney's clerk, the prim curate, the walking
phy&s;ician, the &s;habby valet de chambre upon board wages, and the foreign
count or marquis in di&s;habille, who has refu&s;ed to dine with a duke or an
amba&s;&s;ador. At a little eating-hou&s;e in a dark alley behind the
<HI>'Change</HI> I once &s;aw a grave citizen, worth a plumb, order a two-penny
me&s;s of broth with a boiled chop in it: when it was brought him, he &s;cooped
the crumb out of a half-penny roll, and &s;oaked it in the porridge for his
pre&s;ent meal; then carefully placing the chop between the upper and under
cru&s;t, he wrapped it up in a checked handkerchief, and carried it off for the
morrow's repa&s;t.</P>
<P>I SHALL leave it to you, &s;ir, to make further reflections on
this &s;ubject, and &s;hould be glad to dine with you at any tavern, dive with
you into any cellar, take a beef-&s;teak in <HI>Ivy lane,</HI> a mutton-chop
behind St. <HI>Clement</HI>'s, or, if you chu&s;e it, an extempore &s;au&s;age
or black-pudding over the farthing fries at <HI>Moor-Fields</HI> or the

<P>BY <HI>Jove</HI> it is a &s;hame, a burning &s;hame, to &s;ee
the honour of <HI>England,</HI> the glory of our nation, the greate&s;t pillar
of life, ROAST BEEF, utterly bani&s;hed from our tables. This evil, like many
others, has been growing upon us by degrees: it was begun by wickedly placing
the Beef upon a &s;ide table, and &s;creening it by a parcel of queue-tailed
fel|lows in laced wai&s;tcoats. However, the odorous effluvia generally
affected the &s;mell of every true <HI>Briton</HI> in the room. The butler was
fatigued with carving: the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e grew pale, and &s;ickened at
the &s;ight of tho&s;e juicy collops of fat and lean that came &s;wimming in
gravy <PB N="114" REF="119"> and &s;moaking mo&s;t deliciou&s;ly under our
no&s;trils. Other methods therefore were to be pur&s;ued. The Beef was &s;till
&s;erved up, but it was brought up cold. It was put upon a table in the
darke&s;t part of the room, and immured between four walls formed artificially
by the &s;ervants with the hats of the company. When the jellies and the
&s;lip-&s;lops were coming in, the Beef was carried off in as &s;ecret a manner
as if it had gone through the ceremonies of concoction. But &s;till, &s;ir,
under all the&s;e di&s;advantages we had a chance of getting a &s;lice as it
pa&s;&s;ed by. Now alas! it is not &s;uffered to come up &s;tairs. I dare &s;ay
it is generally bani&s;hed from the &s;teward's table; nor do I &s;uppo&s;e
that the powdered footmen will touch it, for fear of dawbing their ruffles. So
that the di&s;h that was &s;erved up to the royal tables, the di&s;h that was
the breakfa&s;t of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> and her maids of honour, the di&s;h
that received the dignity of knighthood from King <HI>James</HI> the Fir&s;t,
is now become the food only of &s;cullions and &s;table-boys. In what words can
I vent my re&s;entment upon this occa&s;ion? e&s;pecially when I reflect that
innovations &s;eldom come alone. Toa&s;ted chee&s;e is already buried in
rammekins: plumb-porridge has been long ba|ni&s;hed: I tremble for
plumb-pudding. May we not live to &s;ee a leg of pork dete&s;ted as carrion?
and a &s;houlder of mutton avoided as if it were hor&s;e-fle&s;h? Our only
hopes are in the Clergy, and in the Beef-&s;teak Club. The former &s;till
pre&s;erve, and probably will pre&s;erve, the rectitude of their appetites; and
will do ju&s;tice to Beef, wherever they find it. The latter (who are
compo&s;ed of the mo&s;t ingenious arti&s;ts in the kingdom) meet every
Saturday in a noble room at the top of <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> theatre, and
never &s;uffer any di&s;h except Beef-&s;teaks to appear. The&s;e indeed are
mo&s;t glorious examples: but what alas! are the weak endeavours of a few to
oppo&s;e the daily inroads of frica&s;&s;ees and &s;oup-maigres? This, Mr.
TOWN, is a national concern, as it may prove more de&s;tructive to Beef than
the di&s;temper among the horned cattle: and &s;hould the modi&s;h aver&s;ion
again&s;t rumps and &s;irloins continue, it will be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary
to enforce the love of Beef by act of parliament.</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Lady CHARLOTTE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been plagued, pe&s;tered, teized to death, and hurried
out of my wits, ever &s;ince I have been in this odious country. O my dear, how
I long to be in town again! <HI>Pope</HI> and the poets may talk what they will
of their purling &s;treams, &s;hady groves, and flowery meads: but I had rather
live all my days among the chee&s;emongers &s;hops in <HI>Thames Street,</HI>
than pa&s;s &s;uch another &s;pring in this filthy country. Would you believe
it? I have &s;carce touched a card &s;ince I have been here; and then there has
been &s;uch ado with us about election matters, that I am ready to die with the
vapours: &s;uch a rout with their hi&s;&s;ing and hollow|ing, my head is ready
to &s;plit into a thou&s;and pieces! If my Sir <HI>John</HI> mu&s;t be in
parliament, why cannot he do as your lord does, and be content with a borough,
where he might come in without all this trouble; and take his &s;eat in the
hou&s;e, though he has never been within a hundred miles of the place.</P>
<P>OUR hou&s;e, my dear, has been a perfect inn, ever &s;ince we
came down; and I have been obliged to trudge about as much as a fat landlady.
Our doors are open to every dirty fellow in the county that is worth forty
&s;hillings; all my be&s;t floors are &s;poiled by the hobnails of farmers
&s;tumping about them; every room is a pig&s;tye, and the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI>
paper <PB N="117" REF="122"> in the drawing-room &s;tinks &s;o abominably of
punch and tobacco, that it would &s;trike you down to come into it. If you knew
what I have &s;uffered, you would think I had the con&s;titution of a chairman
to go through it. We never &s;it down to table without a dozen or more of
boi&s;terous two-legged creatures as rude as bears; and I have nothing to do
but to heap up their plates, and drink to each of their healths: what is
wor&s;e than all, one of the bea&s;ts got tip&s;y, and nothing would &s;erve
him but he mu&s;t ki&s;s me, which I was obliged to &s;ubmit to for fear of
lo&s;ing his vote and intere&s;t. Would you think it, dear
<HI>Charlotte?</HI>&mdash;do not laugh at me&mdash;I &s;tood godmother in
per&s;on to a huge lubberly boy at a country farmer's, and they almo&s;t
poi&s;oned me with their hodgepodge they called caudle, made of &s;our ale and
brown &s;ugar. All this and more I have been obliged to comply with, that the
country fellows might not &s;ay my lady is proud and above them.</P>
<P>BESIDES, there is not a woman creature within twenty miles of
the place that is fit company for my hou&s;ekeeper, and yet I mu&s;t be
intimate with them all. Lady <HI>B&mdash;</HI> indeed is very near us; but
though we are very well acquainted in town, we mu&s;t not be &s;een to &s;peak
to each other here, becau&s;e her lord is in the oppo&s;ition. Poor
<HI>Thomas</HI> got a &s;ad drubbing at her hou&s;e, when I innocently &s;ent
him at my fir&s;t coming into the country with a how d'ye to her lady|&s;hip.
The greate&s;t female acquaintance I have here are Mrs. Mayore&s;s, a taylor's
wife, and Mrs. Alderman <HI>Ga&s;coyne</HI> who &s;ells pins and needles on one
&s;ide of the &s;hop, while her hu&s;band works at his pe&s;tle and mortar on
the other. The&s;e ordinary wretches are con&s;tant attendants on my tea-table;
I am obliged to take them and their brats out an airing in my coach every
evening; and am afterwards often doomed to &s;it down to whi&s;t and
&s;wabbers, or one and thirty bone-ace <PB N="118" REF="123"> for farthings.
Mrs. Mayore&s;s is a very violent party woman; and &s;he has two pug-dogs, one
of which &s;he calls Sir <HI>John</HI> and the other Colonel, in compliment you
mu&s;t know to my hu&s;band and his brother candidate.</P>
<P>WE had a ball the other day; and I opened it with Sir
<HI>Humphrey Cha&s;e,</HI> who danced in his boots, and hobbled along for all
the world like the dancing bears which I have &s;een in the &s;treets at
<HI>London.</HI> A terrible mi&s;take happened about precedence, which I fear
will lo&s;e Sir <HI>John</HI> a good many votes: an attorney's wife was very
angry that her daughter, who is a little pert chit ju&s;t come from the
board|ing-&s;chool, was not called out to dance before Mi&s;s <HI>Norton</HI>
the brewer's daughter, when every body knew, &s;he &s;aid, that her girl was a
gentlewoman bred and born.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h, my dear, you were to &s;ee my dre&s;&s;ing-room; you
would think it was a ribband-&s;hop. <HI>Lettice</HI> and I have been bu&s;y
all this week in making up knots and favours, and ye&s;terday no milliner's
prentice could work harder than I did in tying them on to the &s;weaty hats of
country bumpkins. And is not it very hard upon me? I mu&s;t not even dre&s;s as
I plea&s;e; but am obliged to wear blue, though you know it does not &s;uit my
complexion, and makes me look as horrid as the witches in <HI>Macbeth.</HI></P>
<P>BUT what is wor&s;e than all, Sir <HI>John</HI> tells me the
election expences have run &s;o high that he mu&s;t &s;horten my allowance of
pin-money. He talks of turning off half his &s;ervants; nay, he has even hinted
to me that I &s;hall not come to town all the winter. Barbarous creature! but
if he dares &s;erve me &s;o, he &s;hall po&s;itively lo&s;e his election next
time; I will rai&s;e &s;uch a &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition in all the wives and
daughters in the county again&s;t him.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="124">YOU &s;ee, my dear, what a mi&s;erable
life I have led ever &s;ince I have been bani&s;hed into this odious country. I
wi&s;h I had married an earl or a duke, and then I &s;hould not have been

<P>THIS lady's ca&s;e, as related above, is indeed a very
di&s;tre&s;sful one; but as Sir <HI>John</HI> has had the good luck to gain his
point after a &s;trong oppo&s;ition, he will doubtle&s;s be &s;en&s;ible of the
great &s;hare his lady had in his &s;ucce&s;s. For my own part, when I
con&s;ider the va&s;t influence which the fair &s;ex mu&s;t naturally have over
my fellow countrymen, I cannot help looking on their intere&s;ting them&s;elves
in the&s;e matters as a very &s;erious affair. What &s;ucce&s;s mu&s;t a fine
lady meet with on her canva&s;s! No gentleman to be &s;ure could be &s;o rude
or &s;o cruel as to refu&s;e &s;uch a pretty beggar any thing &s;he could
a&s;k; and an hone&s;t country farmer, who could with&s;tand any other
arguments, might be coaxed and wheedled, or bribed with a &s;mile, into voting
again&s;t his con&s;cience. Many in&s;tances have been found during the late
election, of hu&s;bands who have been forced to poll as their wives would have
them; and I know a young fellow that was brought over to give a vote again&s;t
his inclination <PB N="120" REF="125"> by his &s;weetheart, who refu&s;ed to
receive his addre&s;&s;es if he did not change his party.</P>
<P>IT may not perhaps be too bold an a&s;&s;ertion, that half the
members in the pre&s;ent parliament owe their &s;eats to the direct or indirect
influence of the other &s;ex: It would there|fore be highly proper for the
legi&s;lature to provide again&s;t this evil for the future, and I hope

<P>_TQUASSOUW, the &s;on of KQVUSSOMO, was <HI>Konquer</HI> or
Chief Captain over the Sixteen Nations of <HI>Caffraria.</HI> He was
de&s;cended from <HI>N'oh</HI> and <HI>Hingn'oh,</HI> who dropt from the Moon;
and his power extended over all the <HI>Kraals</HI> of the
<HI>Hottentots.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Prince was remarkable for his prowe&s;s and activity: his
&s;peed was like the torrent that ru&s;hes down the preci|pice, and he would
overtake the Wild A&s;s in her flight: his Arrows brought down the Eagle from
the clouds, the Lion fell before him, and his Launce drank the blood of the
Rhinoceros. He fathomed the waters of the deep, and buffeted the billows in the
tempe&s;t: he drew the Rock-Pi&s;h from their lurking-holes, and rifled the
beds of Coral. <PB N="122" REF="127"> Trained from his infancy in the
exerci&s;e of war, to wield the Ha&s;&s;agaye with dexterity, and break the
Wild Bulls to battle, he was a &s;tranger to the &s;oft dalliance of love; and
beheld with indifference the thicklipped dam&s;els of <HI>Gongeman,</HI> and
the flatno&s;ed beauties of <HI>Hauteniqua.</HI></P>
<P>AS TQUASSOUW was one day giving in&s;tructions for &s;pread|ing
toils for the Elk, and digging pitfalls for the Elephant, he received
information, that a Tyger prowling for prey was committing ravages on the
<HI>Kraals</HI> of the <HI>Chamtouers.</HI> He &s;natched up his Bow of
Olive-wood, and bounded, like the Roe-Buck on the mountains, to their
a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He ar|rived ju&s;t at the in&s;tant, when the enraged animal
was about to fa&s;ten on a Virgin, and aiming a poi&s;oned arrow at his heart
laid him dead at her feet. The Virgin threw her&s;elf on the ground, and
covered her head with du&s;t, to thank her deliverer; but when &s;he ro&s;e,
the Prince was dazzled with her charms. He was &s;truck with the glo&s;&s;y hue
of her com|plexion, which &s;hone like the jetty down of the Black Hog of
<HI>He&s;&s;aqua</HI>: he was ravi&s;hed with the pre&s;t gri&s;tle of her
no&s;e; and his eyes dwelt with admiration on the flaccid beauties of her
brea&s;ts, which de&s;cended to her navel.</P>
<P>KNONMQUAIHA, (for that was the Virgin's name,) was daughter to
the <HI>Kouqucqua</HI> or Leader of the <HI>Kraal</HI>; who bred her up with
all the delicacy of her &s;ex. She was fed with the entrails of Goats, &s;he
&s;ucked the eggs of the O&s;trich, and her drink was the milk of Ewes. After
gazing for &s;ome time upon her charms, the Prince in great tran&s;port
embraced the &s;oles of her feet: then ripping up the bea&s;t he had ju&s;t
killed, took out the Caul, and hung it about her neck, in token of his
affection. He afterwards &s;tripped the Tyger of his &s;kin, and &s;ending it
to the <HI>Kouqucqua</HI> her father demanded the dam&s;el in marriage.</P>
<P>THE eve of the full moon was appointed for the celebra|tion of
the nuptials of TQUASSOUW and KNONMQUAIHA. When the day arrived, the
magnificence in which the Bridegroom was arrayed amazed all <HI>Caffraria.</HI>
Over his <PB N="123" REF="128"> &s;houlders was ca&s;t a <HI>Kro&s;&s;e</HI> or
Mantle of Wild Cat-&s;kins: he cut Sandals for his feet from the raw hide of an
Elephant; he hunted down a Leopard, and of the &s;potted fur formed a &s;uperb
Cap for his head; he girded his loins with the Inte&s;tines, and the Bladder of
the bea&s;t he blew up and fa&s;tened to his hair.</P>
<P>NOR was KNONMQUAIHA le&s;s employed in adorning her per&s;on.
She made a varni&s;h of the fat of Goats mixed with &s;oot, with which &s;he
anointed her whole body as &s;he &s;tood beneath the rays of the &s;un: her
locks were clotted with melted grea&s;e, and powdered with the yellow du&s;t of
<HI>Buchu:</HI> her face, which &s;hone like the poli&s;hed Ebony, was
beauti|fully varied with &s;pots of Red Earth, and appeared like the &s;able
curtain of the night be&s;pangled with &s;tars: &s;he &s;prinkled her limbs
with wood-a&s;hes, and perfumed them with, the dung of the
<HI>Stinkbing&s;em.</HI> Her arms and legs were entwined with the &s;hining
entrails of a Heifer: from her neck there hung a pouch compo&s;ed of the
&s;tomach of a Kid: the wings of an O&s;trich over&s;hadowed the fle&s;hy
promontories behind; and before &s;he wore an apron formed of the &s;haggy ears
of a Lion.</P>
<P>THE Chiefs of the &s;everal <HI>Kraals,</HI> who were &s;ummoned
to a&s;&s;i&s;t at their nuptials, formed a circle on the ground, &s;itting
upon their heels, and bowed their heads between their knees in token of
reverence. In the centre the illu&s;trious Prince with his &s;able Bride
repo&s;ed upon &s;oft cu&s;hions of Cow-dung. Then the <HI>Surri</HI> or Chief
Prie&s;t approached them, and in a deep voice chaunted the nuptial rites to the
melodious grumbling of the <HI>Gom-Gom</HI>; and at the &s;ame time (according
to the manner of <HI>Caffraria</HI>) bedewed them plentifully with the urinary
benediction. The Bride and Bridegroom rubbed in the precious &s;tream with
exta&s;y; while the briny drops trickled from their bodies, like the oozy
&s;urge from the Rocks of <HI>Chirigriqua.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Hottentots</HI> had &s;een the increa&s;e and wane of
two moons &s;ince the happy union of TQUASSOUW and KNONM|QUAIHA, 
<PB N="124" REF="129"> when the <HI>Kraals</HI> were &s;urpri&s;ed with the
appear|ance of a mo&s;t extraordinary per&s;onage, that came from the &s;avage
people who ro&s;e from the &s;ea, and had lately fixed them&s;elves on the
borders of <HI>Caffraria.</HI> His body was en|wrapped with &s;trange
coverings, which concealed every part from &s;ight except his face and hands.
Upon his &s;kin the &s;un darted his &s;corching rays in vain, and the colour
of it was pale and wan as the watry beams of the moon. His hair, which he could
put on and take off at plea&s;ure, was white as the blo&s;&s;oms of the Almond
Tree, and bu&s;hy as the fleece of the Ram. His lips and cheeks re&s;embled the
Red Oker, and his no&s;e was &s;harpened like the beak of an Eagle. His
language, which was rough and inarticulate, was as the language of bea&s;ts;
nor could TQUASSOUW di&s;|cover his meaning, till a <HI>Hottentot</HI> (who at
the fir&s;t coming of the&s;e people had been taken pri&s;oner, and had
afterwards made his e&s;cape) interpreted between them. This interpre|ter
informed the Prince, that the &s;tranger was &s;ent from his fellow countrymen
to treat about the enlargement of their territories, and that he was called
among them MYNHEER VAN SNICKERSNEE.</P>
<P>TQUASSOUW, who was remarkable for his humanity, treated the
&s;avage with extraordinary benevolence. He &s;pread a mantle of Sheep-&s;kins
anointed with fat for his bed, and for his food he boiled in their own blood
the tripes of the fatte&s;t herds, that grazed in the rich pa&s;tures of the
<HI>Heykoms.</HI> The &s;tranger in return in&s;tructed the Prince in the
manners of the &s;avages, and often amu&s;ed him with &s;ending fire from a
hollow engine, which rent the air with thunder. Nor was he le&s;s &s;tudious to
plea&s;e the gentle KNONMQUAIHA. He bound bracelets of poli&s;hed metal about
her arms, and encircled her neck with beads of gla&s;s: he filled the
Cocoa-&s;hell with a delicious liquor, and gave it her to drink, which
exhilarated her heart, and made her eyes &s;parkle with joy: he al&s;o taught
her to kindle fire through a tube of clay with the dried leaves of
<HI>Dacha,</HI> and to &s;end forth rolls of odorous &s;moke from her mouth.
After having <PB N="125" REF="130"> &s;ojourned in the <HI>Kraals</HI> for the
&s;pace of half a moon, the &s;tranger was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with magnificent
pre&s;ents of the teeth of Elephants; and a grant was made to his countrymen of
the fertile meadows of <HI>Kochoqua,</HI> and the fore&s;ts of
<HI>Stink|wood</HI> bounded by the <HI>Palamite</HI> River.</P>
<P>TQUASSOUW and KNONMQUAIHA continued to live to|gether in the
mo&s;t cordial affection; and the <HI>Surris</HI> every night invoked the great
<HI>Gounja Ticquoa,</HI> who illuminates the Moon, that he would give an heir
to the race of <HI>N'oh</HI> and <HI>Hingn'oh.</HI> The Prince&s;s at length
manife&s;ted the happy tokens of pregnancy; her wai&s;t encrea&s;ed daily in
circum|ference, and &s;welled like the Gourd. When the time of her delivery
approached, &s;he was committed to the care of the Wi&s;e Women, who placed her
on a couch of the reeking entrails of a Cow newly &s;lain, and to facilitate
the birth gave her a potion of the milk of Wild A&s;&s;es, and fomented her
loins with the warm dung of Elephants. When the throes of child-birth came on,
a terrible hurricane howled along the coa&s;t, the air bellowed with thunder,
and the face of the Moon was ob&s;cured as with a veil. The <HI>Kraal</HI>
echoed with &s;hrieks and lamentations, and the Wi&s;e Women cried out, that
the Prince&s;s was delivered of a MONSTER.</P>
<P>THE product of her womb was WHITE.&mdash;They took the child,
and wa&s;hed him with the juice of Aloes:&mdash;they expo&s;ed his limbs to the
&s;un, anointed them with the fat, and rubbed them with the excrement of Black
Bulls:&mdash;but his &s;kin &s;till retained it's dete&s;ted hue, and the child
was &s;till WHITE. The venerable <HI>Surris</HI> were a&s;&s;embled to
deliberate on the cau&s;e of this prodigy; and they unanimou&s;ly pro|nounced,
that it was owing to the evil machinations of the Daemon <HI>Cham-ouna,</HI>
who had practi&s;ed on the virtue of the Prince&s;s under the appearance of
MYNHEER VAN SNICKERSNEE.</P>
<P>THE ince&s;tuous parent with her unnatural offspring were judged
unworthy to live. They bowed a branch of an Olive Tree in the Fore&s;t of
Lions, on which the white mon&s;ter was &s;u&s;pended by the heels; and
ravenous bea&s;ts fea&s;ted on <PB N="126" REF="131"> the i&s;&s;ue of
KNONMQUAIHA. The Prince&s;s her&s;elf was &s;entenced to the &s;evere
puni&s;hment allotted to the heinous crime of Adultery. The
<HI>Kouquequas,</HI> who &s;carce twelve moons before had met to celebrate her
nuptials, were now &s;ummoned to a&s;&s;i&s;t at her unhappy death. They were
collected in a circle, each of them wielding a huge club of Cripplewood. The
beauteous criminal &s;tood weeping in the mid&s;t of them, prepared to receive
the fir&s;t blow from the hand of her injured Hu&s;band. TQUASSOUW in vain
a&s;&s;ayed to perform the &s;ad office: thrice he uplifted his ponderous mace
of iron, and thrice dropt it ineffectual on the ground. At length from his
reluctant arm de&s;cended the fell &s;troke, which lighted on that no&s;e,
who&s;e flatne&s;s and expan&s;ion at fir&s;t captivated his heart. The
<HI>Kouquequas</HI> then ru&s;hing in, with their clubs redoubled their blows
on her body, 'till the pounded KNONMQUAIHA lay as an heap of mud, which the
retiring flood leaves on the &s;trand.</P>
<P>HER battered limbs, now without form and di&s;tinction, were
enclo&s;ed in the paunch of a Rhinoceros, which was fa&s;tened to the point of
a bearded arrow, and &s;hot into the Ocean. TQUASSOUW remained incon&s;olable
for her lo&s;s: he frequently climbed the lofty Cliffs of <HI>Chirigriqua,</HI>
and ca&s;t his eyes on the watry expan&s;e. One night, as he &s;tood howling
with the Wolves to the Moon, he de&s;cried the paunch that contained the
precious relicks of KNONMQUAIHA, dancing on a wave, and floating towards him.
Thrice he cried out with a lamentable voice, <HI>Bo, Bo, Bo:</HI> then
&s;pring|ing from the cliff, he darted like the Eagle &s;ou&s;ing on his prey.
The paunch bur&s;t in &s;under beneath his weight; the green wave was
di&s;coloured with the gore; and TQUAS|SOUW was inveloped in the ma&s;s. He was
heard of no more; and it was believed, that he was &s;natched up into the
Moon.</P>
<P>THEIR unhappy fate is recorded among the Nations of the
<HI>Hottentots</HI> to this day; and their Marriage-rites have ever &s;ince
concluded with a wi&s;h, 
<Q REND="inline">"That the Hu&s;band may be happier than
TQUASSOUW, and the Wife more cha&s;te than KNONMQUAIHA."</Q></P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I REMEMBER, in a match between two per|&s;ons of different
religions, it was &s;tipulated in the marriage articles, that the boys &s;hould
be bred up in the per&s;uation of the father, and the girls in that of the
mother. The con&s;equence of this was, that one part of the family was taught
to look upon the other with a mo&s;t pious comtempt; and in the end it produced
a &s;epara&s;ion. The &s;ons followed the example of their father, and in order
to avoid the lea&s;t appearance of &s;uper&s;tition and bigotry, turned out
free|thinkers: the lady of the hou&s;e retired with her daughters 
<PB N="128" REF="133"> to <HI>France,</HI> and to pre&s;erve them from a
communication with heretics confined them in a nunnery.</P>
<P>THE like method &s;eems to be ob&s;erved in the general
education of children; who as &s;oon as they leave the nur&s;ery, are
re&s;igned over to the care and direction of their re&s;pective parents
according to their &s;ex: whence it often happens, that families are as much
di&s;tingui&s;hed by their peculiar manners, as by a certain ca&s;t of features
or com|plexion. My young '&s;quire is put upon a little hor&s;e before he can
well walk, and becomes (as his father was before him) the pupil and companion
of the groom and the game|keeper: And if mi&s;s's mamma &s;hould chance to be
the daughter of a poor man of quality, and the wife of a &s;ub|&s;tantial
trade&s;man, the little lady is early in&s;tructed to va|lue her&s;elf on her
blood, and to de&s;pi&s;e her father's dirty connections with bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>TO this method of education it is owing, that the &s;ame vices
and follies are delivered down from one generation to another. The modi&s;h
exce&s;&s;es of the&s;e times are in their nature the &s;ame with tho&s;e which
were formerly in vogue, though they differ &s;omewhat in their &s;hape and
appearance. The pre&s;ent race of bucks, bloods, and freethinkers, are but the
&s;pawn of the <HI>Mohocks</HI> and the <HI>Hell-Fire Club:</HI> and if our
modern fine ladies have had their Ma&s;querades, their <HI>Vauxhalls,</HI>
their Sunday Tea Drinkings at <HI>Ranelagh,</HI> and their Morning Chocolate in
the <HI>Hay-Market,</HI> they have only improved upon the <HI>Ring,</HI> the
<HI>Spring-Gardens,</HI> the <HI>New-Exchange</HI> A&s;&s;ignations, and the
Morning Puppet-&s;hew, which employed the attention of their grandmothers: and
as it is not apparent that our people of fa&s;hion are more wicked, &s;o
neither are they wi&s;er than their predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="134">WHEN I contemplate the manner in which
the younger part of the polite world is brought up, I am apt to carry my
reflections farther than what merely concerns their own per&s;ons. Let our
young men of fa&s;hion expo&s;e their igno|rance abroad, rather than improve at
our Univer&s;ities at home;&mdash;let them trifle away their Time in in&s;ipid
amu&s;e|ments, and run loo&s;e about the town in one continued round of
extravagance and debauchery;&mdash;let our young ladies be taught nothing but
gallantry and whi&s;t, and be &s;een only at routes and a&s;&s;emblies, if the
con&s;equence extend not beyond them&s;elves. But as the&s;e are to be the
fathers and mothers, the guardians and tutors, on whom the morals of our next
race mu&s;t depend; it becomes a public concern, le&s;t the reign of vice and
ignorance &s;hould be &s;upported, as it were, by hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion,
and pro|pagated to di&s;tant generations.</P>
<P>THE modern method of education is indeed &s;o little
cal|culated to promote virtue and learning, that it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible
the children &s;hould be wi&s;er or better than their parents. The country
'&s;quire &s;eldom fails of &s;eeing his &s;on as dull and aukward a looby as
him&s;elf; while the debauch|ed or foppi&s;h man of quality breeds up a rake or
an empty coxcomb, who brings new di&s;ea&s;es into the family, and fre&s;h
mortgages on the e&s;tate. If you would therefore favour us, Mr. TOWN, with a
few remarks on this &s;ubject, you would do &s;ervice to po&s;terity: for the
pre&s;ent, give me leave to illu&s;trate what I have &s;aid by the example of a
very fa&s;hionable family.</P>
<P>LADY BELLE MODELY was one of the fine&s;t women in the la&s;t
reign, as the Colonel her hu&s;band was one of the &s;marte&s;t fellows. After
they had a&s;toni&s;hed the world &s;in|gly with the <HI>eclat</HI> of their
actions, they came together: her <PB N="130" REF="135"> lady&s;hip was proud of
fixing a man who was thought to have intrigued with half the women of
fa&s;hion; while the Colonel fell a &s;acrifice to her beauty, only becau&s;e
&s;he was admired by every body el&s;e. They lived together for &s;ome time in
great &s;plendor; but as matrimony was a con&s;traint upon their freedom, they
at length parted by a private agreement. Lady BELLE keeps the be&s;t company,
is at the head of every party of plea&s;ure, never mi&s;&s;es a ma&s;que|rade,
and has card-tables con&s;tantly at her own hou&s;e on Sundays. The Colonel is
one of the olde&s;t members of the Club at <HI>White</HI>'s, runs hor&s;es at
<HI>Newmarket,</HI> has an act|re&s;s in keeping, and is protected from the
impertinence of duns, by having purcha&s;ed a &s;eat in parliament at almo&s;t
as great an expence as would have &s;atisfied the demands of his creditors.</P>
<P>THEY have two children: the one has been educated by the
direction of his father, the other has been bred up under the eye of her mamma.
The boy was indeed put to a grammar-&s;chool for a while; but <HI>Latin</HI>
and <HI>Greek</HI> or indeed any language except <HI>French,</HI> are of no
&s;ervice to a gentleman: and as the lad had di&s;covered early marks of
&s;pirit, (&s;uch as kicking down wheel-barrows and &s;etting old women on
their heads,) the Colonel &s;wore <HI>Jack</HI> &s;hould be a &s;oldier, and
accordingly begged a pair of colours for him, be|fore he was fifteen. The
Colonel who had &s;erved only in the peaceful campaigns of <HI>Covent
Garden,</HI> took great pains to in&s;til into <HI>Jack</HI> all that prowe&s;s
&s;o remarkable in the modern heroes of the army. He enumerated his victories
over bullies, his encounters with &s;harpers, his midnight &s;kirmi&s;hes with
con&s;tables, his &s;torming of bagnio's, his impri&s;onment in round-hou&s;es,
and his honourable wounds in the &s;ervice of pro&s;titutes. The Captain could
not fail of improving under &s;o excellent a tutor, and &s;oon became as 
<PB N="131" REF="136"> eminent as his father. He is a Blood of the fir&s;t
rate; <HI>Sherlock</HI> has in&s;tructed him in the u&s;e of the broad &s;word,
and <HI>Broughton</HI> has taught him to box. He is a fine Gentle|man at
a&s;&s;emblies, a &s;harper at the gaming-table, and a bully at the bagnios. He
has not yet killed his man in the <HI>honourable</HI> way; but he has gallantly
crippled &s;everal watch|men, and mo&s;t couragiou&s;ly run a drawer through
the body. His &s;canty pay will not allow him to keep a mi&s;tre&s;s; but it is
&s;aid that he is privately married to a woman of the town.</P>
<P>SUCH is the con&s;equence of the &s;on's education; and by
this our people of di&s;tinction may learn, how much better it is to let a lad
&s;ee the world (as the phra&s;e is) than to la&s;h him through a
grammar-&s;chool like a pari&s;h-boy, and con|fine him with dull pedants in a
college cloi&s;ter. Lady BELLE has not been le&s;s careful of her daughter
Mi&s;s HARRIOT. Tho&s;e who undertake the bu&s;ine&s;s of educating polite
females have laid it down as a rule to con&s;ider women merely as Dolls; and
therefore never attempt the cultivation of their principles, but employ their
whole attention on adorning their per&s;ons. The romantic notions of honour and
virtue are only fit for poor aukward creatures, who are to marry a &s;hopkeeper
or a par&s;on, but they can be of no u&s;e to a fine girl who is de&s;ign'd to
make a figure. Accordingly Mi&s;s HARRIOT was com|mitted to the care of
<HI>Madame Governante</HI> who never &s;uffered her to &s;peak a word of
<HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and a <HI>French</HI> dancing-ma&s;ter who taught her to
hold up her head, and come into the room like a little lady. As &s;he grew up,
her mamma in|&s;tructed her in the nice&s;t points of ceremony and good
breed|ing: &s;he explained to her the laws and regulations of dre&s;s; directed
her in the choice of her brocades, told her what fa&s;hions be&s;t became her,
and what colours be&s;t &s;uited her complexion. The&s;e excellent rules were
con&s;tantly enforced <PB N="132" REF="137"> by examples drawn from her
lady&s;hip's own practice: above all, &s;he unravelled the various arts of
gallantry and intrigue; recounted the &s;tratagems &s;he had her&s;elf employed
in gain|ing new conque&s;ts, taught her when to advance and when to retreat,
and how far &s;he might venture to indulge her&s;elf in certain freedoms
without endangering her reputation.</P>
<P>MISS HARRIOT &s;oon became the public admiration of all the
pretty fellows, and was allowed to be a lady of the mo&s;t elegant
accompli&s;hments. She was reckoned to play a better game at Whi&s;t than Mrs.
<HI>Sharply,</HI> and bets with more &s;pirit at Brag than the bold Lady
<HI>Atall.</HI> She was carried about to <HI>Tunbridge, Bath, Cheltenham,</HI>
and every other place of diver&s;ion by the mother; where &s;he was expo&s;ed
as at a public mart for beauty, and put up to the be&s;t bidder. But as Mi&s;s
had &s;ome fortune in her own di&s;po&s;al, &s;he had not the patience to wait
the formal delays of marriage articles, jointures, &s;ettlements, and
pin-money; and (ju&s;t before the late Act took place) eloped with a gentleman,
who had long been very intimate with her mamma, and recommended him&s;elf to
MISS HARRIOT by a &s;tature of &s;ix foot and a &s;houlder-knot.</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR COUSIN!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEREVER the Town goes, tho&s;e who live by the Town naturally
follow: the facetious and enter|taining gentry, who during the winter amu&s;ed
the world within the bills of mortality, are now di&s;per&s;ed into differ|ent
parts of the country. We have had mo&s;t of them here already. The
<HI>Colo&s;&s;us,</HI> the <HI>Dwarf,</HI> the <HI>Female Sam|&s;on,</HI> made
&s;ome &s;tay with us. We went for a week toge|ther to &s;ee Mr.
<HI>Powell</HI> eat red hot tobacco pipes, and &s;wallow fire and brim&s;tone:
the <HI>Hermaphrodite</HI> was obliged to leave the town on a &s;candalous
report, that a lady u&s;ed fre|quently to vi&s;it him in private. Mr.
<HI>Church</HI> for &s;ome time charmed us with concertos and &s;onatas on the
Jew's-Harp; and at our la&s;t ball we footed it to our u&s;ual melody of the
Tabor and Pipe, accompanied with the Cymbal and Wooden Spoons.</P>
<P>I WILL not tire you with a particular detail of all our
Entertainments, but confine my&s;elf at pre&s;ent to tho&s;e of the Stage.
About the middle of la&s;t month, there came <PB N="135" REF="140"> among us
one of tho&s;e gentlemen, who are famous for the cure of every di&s;temper, and
e&s;pecially tho&s;e pronounced incurable by the Faculty. The vulgar call him a
<HI>Mounte|bank</HI>;&mdash;and when I con&s;idered his impa&s;&s;ioned
&s;peeches, and the extempore &s;tage from which he uttered them, I was apt to
compare them to <HI>The&s;pis</HI> and his Cart. Again, when I beheld the
Doctor dealing out his drugs, and at the &s;ame time &s;aw his <HI>Merry
Andrew</HI> play over his tricks it put me in mind of a Tragi-Comedy, where the
pathetic and the ludicrous are &s;o intimately connected, and the whole piece
is &s;o merry and &s;o &s;ad, that the audience is at a lo&s;s whether they
&s;hall laugh or cry.</P>
<P>AFTER the Doctor had been here &s;ome time, there came down
two or three emi&s;&s;aries from a Strolling Company, in order (according to
the Player's phra&s;e) to <HI>take the Town</HI>; but the Mayor being a
&s;trict Pre&s;byterian, ab&s;olutely refu|&s;ed to licence their exhibitions.
The Players you mu&s;t know finding this a good town, had taken a lea&s;e
la&s;t Sum|mer of an old Synagogue de&s;erted by the <HI>Jews,</HI> and were
therefore much alarmed at this di&s;appointment: but when they were in the
utmo&s;t de&s;pair, the ladies of the place joined in a petition to Mrs.
Mayore&s;s, who prevailed on her hu&s;band to wink at their performances. The
Company immediately opened their Synagogue-Theatre with the <HI>Merchant of
Venice</HI>; and finding the Doctor's <HI>Zany</HI> a droll fellow, they
decoyed him into their &s;ervice; and he has &s;ince performed the part of the
<HI>Mock Doctor</HI> with univer&s;al applau&s;e. Upon his revolt the Doctor
him&s;elf found it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to enter of the Company, and
having a talent for Tragedy has performed with great &s;ucce&s;s the Apothecary
in <HI>Romeo and Juliet.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="141">THE Performers at our Ru&s;tic Theatre
are far beyond tho&s;e paltry Strollers, who run about the country, and exhibit
in a barn or a cowhou&s;e: for (as their bills declare) they are a Company of
Comedians from the Theatres Royal; and I a&s;&s;ure you, they are as much
applauded by our country critics, as any of your capital actors. The &s;hops of
our trade&s;men have been almo&s;t de&s;erted, and a croud of weavers and
hardware-men have elbowed each other two hours before the opening of the doors,
when the bills have informed us in enormous red letters that the part of
<HI>George Barnwell</HI> was to be performed by Mr. &mdash;, at the parti|cular
de&s;ire of &s;everal ladies of di&s;tinction. It is true in|deed that our
principal actors have mo&s;t of them had their education in <HI>Covent
Garden</HI> or <HI>Drury Lane</HI>; but they have been employed in the
bu&s;ine&s;s of the Drama in a degree but ju&s;t above a Scene-&s;hifter. An
heroine, to whom your managers in town (in envy to her ri&s;ing merit) &s;carce
allotted the humble part of a Confidante, now blubbers out <HI>Andromache</HI>
or <HI>Belvidera:</HI> the attendants on a monarch now &s;trut monarchs
them&s;elves, mutes find their voices, and me&s;&s;age-bearers ri&s;e into
heroes. The humour of our be&s;t Commedian con&s;i&s;ts in &s;hrugs and
grimaces; he jokes in a wry mouth, and repartees in a grin: in &s;hort he
practi&s;es on <HI>Congreve</HI> and <HI>Vanbrugh</HI> all tho&s;e
di&s;tortions, which gained him &s;o much applau&s;e from the galleries in the
drubs which he was condemned to undergo in Pantomimes. I was va&s;tly diverted
at &s;eeing a fellow in the character of Sir <HI>Harry Wildair,</HI> who&s;e
chief action was a continual pre&s;&s;ing together of the thumb and
fore-finger, which, had he lifted them to his no&s;e, I &s;hould have thought
he de&s;igned as an imitation of taking &s;nuff: but I could ea&s;ily account
for the cau&s;e of this &s;ingular ge&s;ture, when I di&s;covered 
<PB N="137" REF="142"> that Sir <HI>Harry</HI> was no le&s;s a per&s;on than
the dextrous Mr. <HI>Clippit</HI> the Candle-&s;nuffer.</P>
<P>YOU would laugh to &s;ee how &s;trangely the parts of a play
are ca&s;t. They played <HI>Cato</HI>; and their <HI>Marcia</HI> was &s;uch an
old woman, that when <HI>Juba</HI> came on with his&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">"Hail! charming maid!"</Q>&mdash;the fellow
could not help laughing. Another night I was &s;urprized to hear an eager lover
talk of ru&s;hing into his mi&s;tre&s;s's arms, rioting on the nectar of her
lips, and de&s;iring (in the tragedy rapture) to hug her thus and thus for
ever; though he always took care to &s;tand at a mo&s;t ceremonious di&s;tance.
But I was afterwards very much diverted at the cau&s;e of this extra|ordinary
re&s;pect, when I was told that the lady laboured under the misfortune of an
ulcer in her leg, which occa|&s;ioned &s;uch a di&s;agreable &s;tench that the
performers were obliged to keep her at arm's length. The entertainment was
<HI>Lethe:</HI> and the part of the <HI>Frenchman</HI> was performed by a
<HI>South-Briton,</HI> who, as he could not pronounce a word of the
<HI>French</HI> language, &s;upplied its place by gabbling in his native
<HI>Welch.</HI></P>
<P>THE Decorations, or (in the Theatrical dialect) the
<HI>Pro|perty</HI> of our Company is as extraordinary as the Performers.
<HI>Othello</HI> raves about a checked handkerchief, the Gho&s;t in
<HI>Hamlet</HI> &s;talks in a po&s;tilion's leather jacket for a coat of mail,
and <HI>Cupid</HI> enters with a fiddle-ca&s;e &s;lung over his &s;houlders for
a quiver. The apothecary of the town is free of the hou&s;e for lending them a
pe&s;tle and mortar to &s;erve as the bell in <HI>Venice Pre&s;erved</HI>; and
a barber-&s;urgeon has the &s;ame privilege for furni&s;hing them ba&s;ons of
blood to be&s;mear the daggers in <HI>Macheth. Macheth</HI> him&s;elf carries a
rolling-pin in his hand for a truncheon, and as the <PB N="138" REF="143">
breaking of gla&s;&s;es would be very expen&s;ive, he da&s;hes down a pewter
pint pot at the &s;ight of <HI>Banquo</HI>'s gho&s;t.</P>
<P>A FRAY happened here the other night, which was no &s;mall
diver&s;ion to the company. It &s;eems there had been a great conte&s;t between
two of the&s;e mimic heroes, which was the fitte&s;t to play <HI>Richard the
Third.</HI> One of them was reckoned to have the better per&s;on, as he was
very round &s;houlder'd, and one of his legs was &s;horter than the other; but
his antagoni&s;t carried the part, becau&s;e he &s;tarted be&s;t in the
Tent-Scene. However, when the curtain drew up, they both ru&s;hed in upon the
&s;cene at once, and bawling out together 
<Q REND="inline">"Now are our brows bound with victo|rious
wreaths,"</Q> they both went through the whole &s;peech without &s;topping.</P>

<P>_WHEN I con&s;ider the ab&s;urd ta&s;te for lite|rature that
once prevailed among our per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, I cannot but applaud the
reformation which has been &s;ince brought about in this article by the polite
world. A Duke of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> made him&s;elf remarkable by a
Trea|ti&s;e on Hor&s;eman&s;hip; a <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> &s;upplied the place of
<HI>Ovid</HI> in the clo&s;ets of men of plea&s;ure; and even the ladies of
former ages &s;acrificed to love in Novels and Romances.&mdash;I will not
mention a <HI>Shaft&s;bury,</HI> as our pre&s;ent age has pro|duced a
<HI>Bolinbroke.</HI>&mdash;We of this generation are wi&s;er than to &s;uffer
our youth of quality to lo&s;e their precious time in &s;tudying the <HI>belles
lettres,</HI> while our only care is to intro|duce <PB N="140" REF="145"> them
into the <HI>beau monde.</HI> A modern peer, in&s;tead of laying down the
theory of hor&s;eman&s;hip, is perfect in the practice, and commences jockey
him&s;elf; and our rakes of fa&s;hion are content with acting the &s;cenes
which <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> de&s;cribed. Our ladies are, indeed, very well
qualified to publi&s;h a recital of amours; and one in particular has al|ready
entertained the world with memoirs of her own intrigues, cuckoldoms and
elopements.</P>
<P>I AM very glad to find the pre&s;ent age &s;o entirely free from
pedantry: &s;ome part of the polite world read indeed, but they are &s;o wi&s;e
as to read only for amu&s;ement; or at lea&s;t only to improve them&s;elves in
the more modern and fa&s;hionable &s;ciences. A Treati&s;e on Whi&s;t has more
ad|mirers than a Sy&s;tem of Logic, and a New Atalantis would be more
univer&s;ally read than a Practice of Piety. A fine gentleman or lady would no
more chu&s;e the mind of a pedant, than the per&s;on of a cook-maid or a
porter. I can|not therefore but approve of the plan laid down by the writer of
the following letter, and would recommend it to all per&s;ons of fa&s;hion to
&s;ub&s;cribe to his propo&s;als.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE long ob&s;erved with infinite regret the little care
that is taken to &s;upply per&s;ons of di&s;tinction with pro|per books for
their in&s;truction and amu&s;ement. It is no wonder that they &s;hould be &s;o
aver&s;e to &s;tudy, when learn|ing is rendered &s;o di&s;agreeable. Common
creatures indeed, as &s;oon as they can &s;pell, may be made to read a dull
chap|ter in the Te&s;tament; after which the Whole Duty of Man, or &s;ome other
u&s;ele&s;s good book, may be put into their hands: <PB N="141" REF="146"> but
the&s;e can never in&s;truct a man of the world to &s;ay fine things to a lady,
or to &s;wear with a good grace. Among a few dirty pedants the knowledge of
<HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> may be cultivated; but among fine gentlemen
the&s;e are ju&s;tly di&s;carded for <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Italian.</HI> Why
&s;hould per&s;ons of quality trouble them&s;elves about Mathematics and
Philo|&s;ophy, or throw away their time in &s;cratching circles and triangles
on a &s;late, and then rubbing them out again? All the Algebra requi&s;ite for
them to know, is the combi|nation of figures on the dice; nor could
<HI>Euclid</HI> be of any u&s;e to them, except he had repre&s;ented the mo&s;t
graceful attitudes in fencing, or drawn out the lines of a minuet.</P>
<P>IN order to remedy the&s;e inconveniences, and that the
erudition of per&s;ons of fa&s;hion may be as different from the vulgar
knowledge of the re&s;t of mankind as their dre&s;s, I have formed a project
for regulating their &s;tudies. An old crabbed Philo&s;opher once told a
monarch, that there was no Royal way of learning the Mathematics:&mdash;Fir&s;t
then, as to the mu&s;ty volumes which contain <HI>Greek, Latin,</HI> and the
Sciences, (&s;ince there is no genteel method of coming at the knowledge of
them,) I would bani&s;h them intirely from the polite world, and have them
chained down in univer&s;ity libraries, the only places where they can be
u&s;eful or enter|taining. Having thus cleared the &s;helves of this learned
lumber, we &s;hall have room to fill them more elegantly. To this end I have
collected all &s;uch books as are proper to be peru&s;ed by people of quality,
and &s;hall &s;hortly make my Scheme public by opening a hand&s;ome room under
the title of the <HI>Polite Circulating Library.</HI> Many of my books are
entirely new and original: all the modern novels, and mo&s;t of the periodical
papers fall &s;o directly in with my plan, that they will be &s;ure to find a
place in my library; and <PB N="142" REF="147"> if Mr. TOWN &s;hews him&s;elf
an encourager of my &s;cheme, I &s;hall expect to &s;ee peers and peere&s;&s;es
take up the pen, and &s;hine in the CONNOISSEUR.</P>
<P>I INTEND in the beginning of the winter to publi&s;h my
propo&s;als at large, and in the mean time beg you to &s;ubmit the following
&s;pecimen of my books to the public.</P>

<P>_A LITTLE <HI>Frenchman,</HI> commonly known in town by the name
of <HI>Count,</HI> and who&s;e figure has been long &s;tuck up in the win|dows
of print&s;hops, was always remarkable for the meanne&s;s and at the &s;ame
time the foppery of his appearance. His &s;hoes, though perhaps capped at the
toe, had red heels to them; and his &s;tock|ings, though often full of holes,
were con&s;tantly rolled up over his knees. By good luck he was once ma&s;ter
of half a guinea; and having a great longing for a feather to his hat, and a
very pre&s;&s;ing nece&s;&s;ity for a pair of breeches, he de|bated with
him&s;elf about the di&s;po&s;al of his money. How|ever his vanity got the
better of his nece&s;&s;ity; and the next <PB N="146" REF="151"> time the
<HI>Count</HI> appeared in the Mall, by the ornaments of his head you would
have imagined him a Beau, and by the nether part of his dre&s;s you would have
taken him for a Heathen Philo&s;opher.</P>
<P>THE conduct of this <HI>Frenchman,</HI> however ridiculous, is
copied by a multitude of people in this town. To the &s;ame little pride of
de&s;iring to appear finer than they can afford, are owing the many ru&s;ty
&s;uits of black, the tyes that &s;eem taken from the ba&s;ket of a &s;hoeboy,
and the &s;mart wai&s;tcoats edged with a narrow cord, which &s;erves as an
apology for lace. I know a man of this ca&s;t who has but one coat; but by now
and then turning the cuffs, and chang|ing the cape, it pa&s;&s;es for two. He
u&s;es the &s;ame artifice with his peruke, which is naturally a kind of
flowing Bob; but by the occa&s;ional addition of two tails to it, it
&s;ometimes appears as a Major. Of this &s;ort of men are compo&s;ed the
numerous fraternity of the &s;habby-genteel, who are the chief &s;upport of the
clothiers in <HI>Monmouth-&s;treet,</HI> and the barbers in <HI>Middle
Row.</HI></P>
<P>WOMEN are naturally &s;o fond of ornament, that it is no wonder
we &s;hould meet with &s;o many &s;econd-hand gentry in that &s;ex. Hence
ari&s;e the red-armed Belles that appear in the Park every Sunday; hence it is
that Sacks and Peten|lairs may be &s;een at <HI>Moor-Fields</HI> and
<HI>Whitechapel</HI>; and that tho&s;e, who are ambitious to &s;hine in
diamonds, glitter in pa&s;te and Scotch pebbles. When I &s;ee the wives and
daugh|ters of trade&s;men and mechanics make &s;uch attempts at finery, I
cannot help pitying their poor fathers and hu&s;bands, and at the &s;ame time
am apt to con&s;ider their dre&s;s as a robbery on the &s;hop. Thus when I
ob&s;erve the tawdry gentility of a tallow-chandler's daughter, I look upon her
as hung round with long &s;ixes, &s;hort eights, and ru&s;h-lights; and If I
con|template <PB N="147" REF="152"> the aukward pride of dre&s;s in a butcher's
wife, I &s;uppo&s;e her carrying about her &s;irloins of beef, fillets of veal,
and &s;houlders of mutton. I was va&s;tly diverted with a di&s;|covery I made a
few days &s;ince. Going upon &s;ame bu&s;ine&s;s to a trade&s;man's hou&s;e, I
&s;urprized in a very extraordinary di&s;habille two females, whom I had been
frequently u&s;ed to &s;ee &s;trangely dizened out in the Mall. The&s;e fine
Ladies, it &s;eems, were no other than my hone&s;t friend's daughters; and one,
who always dre&s;&s;es the family-dinner, was gen|teelly employed in winding up
the jack, while the other was up to the elbows in &s;oap-&s;uds.</P>
<P>A DESIRE of grandeur and magnificence is often ab&s;urd in
tho&s;e who can &s;upport it; but when it takes hold of tho&s;e who can
&s;carce furni&s;h them&s;elves with nece&s;&s;aries, their poverty, in&s;tead
of demanding our pity, becomes an object of ridicule. Many families among
tho&s;e who are called middling people, are not content without living
elegantly as well as comfortably, and often involve them&s;elves in very
comical di&s;tre&s;&s;es. When they aim at appearing grand in the eye of the
world, they grow proportionably mean and &s;ordid in private. I went the other
day to dine with an old friend; and as he u&s;ed to keep a remarkable good
table, I was &s;urprized that I could &s;carce make a meal with him. After
dinner he rung the bell, and ordered the chariot to be got ready at &s;ix; and
then turning to me with an air of &s;upe|riority, a&s;ked if he &s;hould &s;et
me down. Here the riddle was out; and I found that his equipage had eat up his
table, and that he was obliged to &s;tarve his family to feed his hor&s;es.</P>
<P>I AM acquainted with another family, where the ma&s;ter keeps an
account again&s;t him&s;elf. This account is exactly &s;tated in a large
ledger-book. What he &s;aves from his ordi|nary expences he places under the
title of DEBTOR, and what <PB N="148" REF="153"> he runs out is ranged under
CREDITOR. I had lately an op|portunity of turning over this curious account,
and could not help &s;miling at many of the articles. Among the re&s;t I
re|member the following, with which I &s;hall pre&s;ent the reader.</P>

<P><PB N="149" REF="154">TRUE oeconomy does not merely con&s;i&s;t
in not exceeding our income, but in &s;uch a judicious management of it as
renders our whole appearance equal and con&s;i&s;tent. We &s;hould laugh at a
nobleman, who to &s;upport the expence of running hor&s;es &s;hould abridge his
&s;et to a pair, and that his jockey's might come in fir&s;t for the plate be
content to have his family dragged to his country-&s;eat, like &s;ervant-maids
in the Caravan. There are many well-meaning peo|ple, who have the pride of
living in a polite quarter of the town, though they are di&s;tre&s;&s;ed to pay
the taxes: and what is more common than to &s;ee one particular room in an
hou&s;e furni&s;hed like a palace, while the re&s;t have &s;carce the
nece&s;|&s;ary accommodations of an inn? &s;uch a conduct appears to me equally
ridiculous with that of the <HI>Frenchman,</HI> who (ac|cording to the je&s;t)
for the &s;ake of wearing ruffles is con|tented to go without a &s;hirt.</P>
<P>THIS endeavour to appear grander than our circum&s;tances will
allow, is no where &s;o contemptible as among tho&s;e men of plea&s;ure about
town, who have not fortunes in any pro|portion to their &s;pirit. Men of
quality have wi&s;ely contrived that their &s;ins &s;hould be expen&s;ive: for
which rea&s;on tho&s;e, who with equal ta&s;te have le&s;s money, are obliged
to be oeconomi&s;ts in their &s;ins, and are put to many little &s;hifts to
appear tolerably profligate and debauched. They get a knowledge of the names
and faces of the mo&s;t noted women upon town, and pretend an intimate
acquaintance with them, though they know none of that order of ladies above the
draggle-tailed pro&s;titutes who walk the <HI>Strand.</HI> They talk very
familiarly of the <HI>King's Arms,</HI> and are in raptures with Mrs.
<HI>Allen</HI>'s Claret; though they always dine &s;nugly at a Chop-hou&s;e,
and &s;pend their evening at an Ale-hou&s;e or Cyder-cellar. The mo&s;t
ridiculous character I know of <PB N="150" REF="155"> this &s;ort is a young
fellow, the &s;on of a rich tobacconi&s;t in the city, who (becau&s;e it is the
fa&s;hion) has taken a girl into keeping. He knows the world better than to
&s;et her up a chariot, or let her have money at her own di&s;po&s;al. He
regulates her expences with the nice&s;t oeconomy, and em|ploys every morning
in &s;etting down what is laid out upon her. He very &s;eriou&s;ly takes an
account of Rolls and Butter, two-pence.&mdash;For Ribband, one &s;hilling and
four pence.&mdash;Pins, a half-penny, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> Thus does he
reconcile his extravagance and frugality to each other, and is as penurious and
exact as an u&s;urer, that he may be as genteel and as wicked as a lord.</P>

<P>_A GENTLEMAN of my acquaintance lately laid before me an
e&s;timate of the con&s;umption of bread and chee&s;e, cakes, ale, &amp;c. in
all the little towns near <HI>London</HI> every Sunday. It is incredible how
many thou&s;and buns are devoured in that one day at <HI>Chel&s;ea</HI> and
<HI>Paddington</HI>; and how much beer is &s;wallowed at <HI>Pancras</HI> and
<HI>Mile End.</HI> Upon the whole I was va&s;tly entertained with a review of
this e&s;timate, and could not help approving the ob&s;ervation of <HI>Tom
Brown,</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"that the Sabbath is a very fine in&s;titution,
&s;ince the very breaking it is the &s;upport of half the vil|lages about our
metropolis."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="157">OUR common people are very ob&s;ervant of
that part of the commandment, which enjoins them to do no manner of work on
that day, which they al&s;o &s;eem to under&s;tand as a licence to devote it to
plea&s;ure. They take this opportunity of thru&s;ting their heads into the
pillory at <HI>Georgia,</HI> being &s;worn at <HI>Highgate,</HI> and rolling
down <HI>Flam&s;tead Hill</HI> in the Park at <HI>Greenwich.</HI> As they all
aim at going into the country, nothing can be a greater misfortune to the
meaner part of the inhabitants of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI>
than a rainy Sunday; and how many hone&s;t people would be baulked of a ride
once a week, if the legi&s;lature was to limit the hired one-hor&s;e-chai&s;es
working on that day to a certain number as well as the hackney coaches.</P>
<P>THE &s;ub&s;tantial trade&s;man is carried to his &s;nug-box,
which has nothing rural about it except the ivy that over|runs the front, and
is placed as near to the road &s;ide as po&s;|&s;ible, where the plea&s;ure of
&s;eeing carriages pa&s;s under his window amply compen&s;ates for his being
almo&s;t &s;mothered with du&s;t. The few &s;mart 'prentices, who are able to
&s;it a hor&s;e, may be &s;een &s;purring their broken-winded hacks up the
hills; and the good-natured hu&s;band together with his mate is dragged along
the road to the envy and admi|ration of the foot-pa&s;&s;enger, who (to
compleat the Sun|day picture) trudges patiently with a child in one arm, while
his beloved doxy leans on the other and waddles at his &s;ide &s;weltering
beneath the unu&s;ual weight of an hoop-petticoat.</P>
<P>IT is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the country has in it&s;elf
any peculiar attractive charms to tho&s;e who think them|&s;elves out of the
world, if they are not within the &s;ound of <HI>Bow Bell.</HI> To mo&s;t of
our Cockneys it &s;erves only as an excu&s;e for eating and drinking; and they
get out of town, <PB N="153" REF="158"> merely becau&s;e they have nothing to
do at home; a brick|kiln &s;mells as &s;weet to them as a farm-yard: they would
pa&s;s by a barn or a hay-&s;tack without notice; but they re|joice at the
&s;ight of every hedge ale-hou&s;e, that promi&s;es good home-brew'd. As the
re&s;t of a cit's life is regular and uniform, his Sunday diver&s;ions have as
little variety; and if he was to take a journal of them, we might &s;uppo&s;e
that it would run much in the following manner.</P>

</LIST></Q>
<P>AS to per&s;ons of quality, like Lady <HI>Loverule</HI> in the
farce, they can not &s;ee why one day &s;hould be more holy than ano|ther:
therefore Sunday wears the &s;ame face with them as the re&s;t of the week.
Accordingly, for &s;ome part of this &s;ummer <HI>Ranelagh</HI> was opened on
Sunday evenings; and I cannot help wondering that the cu&s;tom did not
continue. It mu&s;t have been very convenient to pa&s;s away the time there;
till the hour of meeting at the card-table; and it was certainly more decent to
fix a&s;&s;ignations, there, than at church.</P>
<P>GOING to Church may indeed be reckoned among our Sunday
amu&s;ements, as it is made a mere matter of diver|&s;ion among many
well-meaning people, who are induced to appear in a place of wor&s;hip from the
&s;ame motives that they frequent other public places. To &s;ome it an&s;wers
all the pur|po&s;es of a route or a&s;&s;embly,&mdash;to &s;ee and be &s;een by
their acquaintance; and from their bows, nods, curt'&s;ies, and loud
conver&s;ations one might conclude that they imagined them|&s;elves in a
drawing-room. To others it affords the cheap op|portunity of &s;hewing their
ta&s;te for dre&s;s: not a few, I be|lieve, are drawn together in our
cathedrals and larger churches by the influence of the mu&s;ic more than the
prayers, and are kept awake by a jig from the organ-loft, tho they lulled to
&s;leep by the harangue from the pulpit. A well di&s;po&s;ed Chri&s;tian will
go a mile from his own hou&s;e to the Temple-Church, <PB N="155" REF="160">
Church, not becau&s;e a <HI>Sherlock</HI> is to preach, but to hear a Solo from
<HI>Stanley.</HI></P>
<P>BUT though going to church may be deemed a kind of amu&s;ement,
yet upon modern principles it appears &s;uch a very odd one, that I am at at a
lo&s;s to account for the rea&s;ons which induced our ance&s;tors to give into
that method of pa&s;&s;ing their Sunday. At lea&s;t it is &s;o wholly
incompatible with the polite &s;y&s;tem of life, that a per&s;on of fa&s;hion
(as affairs are now managed) finds it ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to comply
with this practice. Then again the &s;ervice always begins at &s;uch
unfa&s;hionable hours, that in the morning a man mu&s;t huddle on his cloaths
like a boy to run to &s;chool, and in an afternoon mu&s;t inevitably go without
his dinner. In order to remove all the&s;e objections, and that &s;ome Ritual
may be e&s;tabli&s;hed in this kingdom agreeable to our inclina|tions and
con&s;i&s;tent with our practice, the following SCHEME has been lately &s;ent
me in order to &s;ubmit it to the &s;erious con&s;ideration of the public.</P>
<Q> 
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Imprimis,</HI> IT is humbly propo&s;ed, that
Chri&s;tianity be entirely aboli&s;hed by Act of Parliament, and that no other
religion be impo&s;ed on us in it's &s;tead; but as the age grows daily more
and more enlightened, we may at la&s;t be quite delivered from the influence of
&s;uper&s;tition and bigotry.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Secondly,</HI> THAT in order to prevent our ever
relap&s;ing into pious errors, that the common people may not lo&s;e their
holiday, every Sunday be &s;et apart to commemorate our victory over all
religion; that the Churches be turned into Free-thinking Meeting-Hou&s;es, and
di&s;cour&s;es read in them to confute the Doctrine of a future &s;tate, the
im|mortality of the &s;oul, and other ab&s;urd notions which &s;ome people now
regard as objects of belief.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="156" REF="161"><HI>Thirdly,</HI> THAT a Ritual be
compiled exactly oppo&s;ite to our pre&s;ent Liturgy; and that in&s;tead of
reading portions of Scripture, the fir&s;t and &s;econd le&s;&s;ons &s;hall
con&s;i&s;t of a Section of the Po&s;thumous Works of Lord <HI>Bolinbroke,</HI>
or of a few pages from the writings of <HI>Spinoza, Chubb, Maundeville, Hobbes,
Collins, Tindal, &amp;c.</HI> from which writers the preach|ers &s;hall al&s;o
take their text.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Fourthly,</HI> THAT the u&s;ual Fea&s;ts and Fa&s;ts,
viz. Chri&s;t|mas Day, Ea&s;ter Sunday, Trinity Sunday, &amp;c. be &s;till
pre&s;erved; but that on tho&s;e days di&s;cour&s;es be delivered &s;uit|able
to the occa&s;ion, containing a refutation of the Nativity, the Re&s;urrection,
the Trinity, &amp;c.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Fifthly,</HI> THAT in&s;tead of the vile melody of a
Clerk bawling out two Staves of <HI>Sternhold</HI> and <HI>Hopkins,</HI> or a
Cathedral Choir &s;inging Anthems from the P&s;alter, &s;ome of the mo&s;t
fa&s;hionable Cantatas, Opera Airs, Songs, or Catches, be performed by the
be&s;t voices for the enter|tainment of the company.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> THAT the whole Service be conducted
with &s;uch ta&s;te and elegance as may render the&s;e Free-thinking
Meeting-Hou&s;es as agreeable as the Theatres; and that they may be even more
judiciou&s;ly calculated for the propagation of Athei&s;m and Infidelity than
the <HI>Robin Hood</HI> Society or the Oratory in <HI>Clare Market.</HI></ITEM>

<P>_IT is a heavy tax upon authors that they &s;hould always be
expected to write &s;en&s;e. Some few indeed, who are rich in &s;enti|ment, pay
this tax very chearfully, but the generality endeavour one way or another to
elude it. For this purpo&s;e &s;ome have moulded their pieces into the form of
wings, axes, eggs, and altars; while others have laced down the &s;ide of a
copy of ver&s;es with the letters of their mi&s;tre&s;s's name, and called it
an acro&s;tic: not to mention the curious inventions of rebu&s;&s;es and
anagrams. For the &s;ame rea&s;ons, the modern &s;ong-writers for our public
gardens, who are our principal love-poets at pre&s;ent, entertain us with
&s;onnets and madigrals in <PB N="158" REF="163"> Crambo. Authors who promi&s;e
wit, pay us off with puns and quibbles; and with our writers of comedy, long
&s;words, &s;hort jerkins, and tables with carpets over them pa&s;s for
incident and humour.</P>
<P>BUT no artifice of this &s;ort has been &s;o often and &s;o
&s;uc|ce&s;sfully practiced as the immoderate u&s;e of uncouth terms and
expre&s;&s;ions. Words that mean nothing, provided they &s;ound big, and fill
the ear, are the be&s;t &s;uccedanium for &s;en&s;e. Nothing &s;o effectually
an&s;wers Mr. <HI>Bayes</HI>'s endea|vour to <HI>elevate and &s;urprize</HI>;
and the reader, tho' he &s;ees nothing but &s;traws float on the &s;urface,
candidly &s;uppo&s;es that there are pearls and diamonds at the bottom. Several
dull authors by availing them&s;elves of this &s;ecret have pa&s;&s;ed for very
deep writers, and arrant Non&s;en&s;e has as often laid &s;nugly beneath hard
words, as a &s;hallow pate beneath the &s;olemn appearance of a full-bottomed
periwig.</P>
<P>THOSE who are employed in what they call ab&s;tract
&s;pe|culations mo&s;t commonly have recour&s;e to this method. Their
di&s;&s;ertations are naturally expected to illu&s;trate and explain, but this
is &s;ometimes a ta&s;k above their abilities; and when they have led the
reader into a maze, from which they cannot deliver him, they very wi&s;ely
bewilder him the more. This is the ca&s;e with tho&s;e profound writers who
have treated concerning the e&s;&s;ence of matter, who talk very gravely of
cuppeity, tableity, tallow-chandleity, and twenty other things with as much
&s;ound and as little &s;ignification. Of the&s;e we may very well &s;ay with
the poet, 
<Q> 
<L>Such labour'd nothings in &s;o &s;trange a &s;tile,</L> 
<L>Amaze th'unlearn'd, and make the learned &s;mile.</L> 
<BIBL>POPE.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="164">NO mode of expre&s;&s;ion throws &s;uch an
impenetrable mi&s;t over a work as an unnece&s;&s;ary profu&s;ion of Technical
Terms. This will appear very plainly to tho&s;e who will turn over a few pages
of a modern Collection of Voyages. De&s;criptions of a &s;torm make &s;ome of
the fine&s;t and mo&s;t &s;triking pa&s;&s;ages in the be&s;t poets, and it is
for the&s;e in particular that <HI>Lon|ginus</HI> admires the
<HI>Ody&s;&s;ey.</HI> The real circum&s;tances of a &s;torm are in them&s;elves
without the aid of poetical ornaments very affecting, yet whoever reads an
account of them in any of our writers of Voyages, will be &s;o puzzled and
perplexed with <HI>Starboard</HI> and <HI>Larboard,</HI> the
<HI>Main-ma&s;t</HI> and <HI>Mizen-ma&s;t,</HI> and a multitude of Sea-terms,
that he will not be the lea&s;t moved at the di&s;tre&s;s of the &s;hip's crew.
The ab&s;urdity of this did not e&s;cape <HI>Swift,</HI> who has ridiculed it
by a mock de&s;cription of the &s;ame kind in his <HI>Gulliver.</HI> Tho&s;e
who treat military &s;ubjects are equally ridiculous: they over|whelm you with
<HI>Counter&s;carps, Pali&s;ades, Ba&s;tions,</HI> &amp;c. and &s;o fortify
their no-meaning with hard words, that it is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to
beat them out of their intrenchments. Such writers, who abound in Technical
Terms, always put me in mind of <HI>Ignoramus</HI> in the play, who courts his
mi&s;tre&s;s out of the law-dictionary, runs over a long catalogue of the
me&s;&s;uages, lands, tenements, barns, outhou&s;es, &amp;c. of which he will
put her in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, if &s;he will <HI>join i&s;&s;ue</HI> with him,
and manife&s;ts his pa&s;&s;ion in the &s;ame manner that he would draw up a
lea&s;e.</P>
<P>THIS affectation is never more offen&s;ive than when it gets
into the Pulpit. The greater part of almo&s;t every audience that &s;its under
our preachers are ignorant and illiterate, and &s;hould therefore have every
thing delivered to them in as plain, &s;imple, and intelligible a manner as
po&s;&s;ible. Hard words, if they have any meaning, can only 
<PB N="160" REF="165"> &s;erve to make them &s;tare, and they can never be
edified by what they do not under&s;tand. Young clergymen ju&s;t come from the
Univer&s;ity, are proud of &s;hewing the world that they have been reading the
Fathers, and are fond of entering on the mo&s;t ab&s;tru&s;e points of
Divinity. But they would employ their time more to their own credit as well as
the improvement of their hearers, if they would rather endea|vour to explain
and inforce the precepts of the Apo&s;tles and Evangeli&s;ts, than retail the
confu&s;ed hypothe&s;es of crab|bed metaphy&s;icians.</P>
<P>AS to e&s;&s;ays, and all other pieces that come under the
denomination of familiar writings, one would ima|gine that they mu&s;t
nece&s;&s;arily be written in the ea&s;y language of Nature and Common-Sen&s;e.
No writer can flatter him&s;elf that his productions will be an agree|able part
of the equipage of the tea-table, who writes almo&s;t too ab&s;tru&s;ely for
the &s;tudy, and involves his thoughts in hard words and affected latini&s;ms.
Yet this has been reckoned by many the &s;tandard &s;tile for the&s;e loo&s;e
de|tatched pieces. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> was proud that he could boa&s;t of having
drawn learning out of &s;chools and colleges into clubs and coffee-hou&s;es, as
<HI>Socrates</HI> was &s;aid to draw morality from the clouds to dwell among
men: but the&s;e people (as Lord <HI>Bolinbroke</HI> pretends to &s;ay of the
&s;ame <HI>Socrates</HI>) mount the Clouds them&s;elves. This new-fangled
manner of delivering our &s;entiments is cal|led writing &s;ound &s;en&s;e: if
I find this mode &s;eems likely to prevail, I &s;hall certainly think it
expedient to give into it, and very &s;uddenly oblige the world with a
CONNOISSEUR &s;o <HI>&s;en&s;ible</HI> that it will be impo&s;&s;ible to
under&s;tand it.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="166">BUT hard words and uncouth ways of
expre&s;&s;ing our&s;elves never appear with &s;o ill a grace as in our common
conver&s;ation: in writings we expect &s;ome degree of exactne&s;s and
preci&s;ion, but if even there they &s;eem har&s;h and di&s;agreeable, when
they ob&s;truct the freedom of our familiar chat, they either make us laugh or
put us out of patience. However &s;ome gentlemen, who would be accounted
fine-&s;poken per&s;ons, make u&s;e of them upon all occa&s;ions, and &s;carce
enquire how you do, or bid you good-morrow in any phra&s;e that is
intelligible. It always puts me in pain to find a lady give into this practice:
if &s;he makes no blunder, it &s;ets very ungracefully upon her; but it is ten
to one that the rough uncouth &s;yllables that form the&s;e words are too
har&s;h and big for the pretty creature's mouth, and then &s;he maims them and
breaks them to her u&s;e &s;o whim&s;ically, that one can &s;carce tell whether
&s;he is talking <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI>&mdash;I &s;hall make no
more reflections on this &s;ubject at pre&s;ent, but conclude my paper with a
&s;hort &s;tory.</P>
<P>A MERRY fellow, who was formerly of the univer|&s;ity, going
through <HI>Cambridge</HI> on a journey, took it into his head to call on his
old tutor. As it is no great wonder that pedantry &s;hould be found in a
college, the tutor u&s;ed to lard his conver&s;ation with numberle&s;s hard
words and forced derivations from the <HI>Latin.</HI> His pupil, who had a mind
to banter the old gentleman on his darling foible, when he vi&s;ited him
entered his cham|bers with his hat in one hand, and a dictionary in the other.
The fir&s;t compliments were &s;carce over before the tutor bolted out a word
big enough for the mouth of <HI>Garagantua.</HI> Here the pupil begged that he
would &s;top a little, and after turning over his dictionary de&s;ired him 
<PB N="162" REF="167"> to proceed. The learned gentleman went on, and the pupil
&s;eem'd to li&s;ten with great attention, till another word came out as hard
as the former, at which he again interrupted him, and again had recour&s;e to
his dictionary. This put the Old Don &s;o much out of patience, that he ro&s;e
in a rage, and bid him get out of the room for an ig|norant impudent
coxcomb.</P>

<P>_TOM DARE-DEVIL, who was &s;o much &s;uperior to the re&s;t of
our BUCKS that he gained the appellation of STAG, fini&s;hed a cour&s;e of
continual debaucheries, and was carried off la&s;t week by a phrene|tic fever.
I happened to be pre&s;ent at his la&s;t moments, and the remembrance of him
&s;till dwells &s;o &s;trongly on my mind, that I &s;ee him, I hear him, in all
the agonies of de&s;pair, &s;tarting, trembling, and uttering the mo&s;t horrid
execrations. His con&s;cience at the approach of death had conjured up before
him 
<Q REND="inline">"ten thou&s;and devils with their red-hot
&s;pits"</Q> who a&s;&s;umed the &s;hapes of all tho&s;e whom he had injured,
and 
<Q REND="inline">"came hi&s;&s;ing on him"</Q> to retaliate 
<PB N="164" REF="169"> their wrongs. 
<Q REND="inline">"Save me, &s;ave me,"</Q> he would cry, 
<Q REND="inline">"from that bleeding form.&mdash;He was my
friend&mdash;but I run him through the heart in a quarrel about a
whore."&mdash;</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Take away that old fellow&mdash;He would have
carried us to the Round-Hou&s;e&mdash;I knocked him down with his own &s;taff,
but I did not think the poor dog would have died by it."</Q> When the nur&s;e
offered him a draught to take, 
<Q REND="inline">"Why, &s;aid he, will you ply me with
Champagne?&mdash;'tis a dam|nable liquor, and I'll drink no more of it."</Q> In
one of his lucid intervals he gra&s;ped my hand vehemently, and bur&s;t|ing
into tears, 
<Q REND="inline">"Would to God, &s;aid he, I had died twenty
years ago."</Q> At length his unwilling &s;oul parted from the body, and the
la&s;t words we heard from him were a faint ejaculation to his Maker, whom he
had bla&s;phemed all his life. His &s;hocking exit made me reflect on that fine
pa&s;&s;age in the &s;criptures, 
<Q REND="inline">"Let me die the death of the righteous, and let
my la&s;t end be like his."</Q></P>
<P>THE behaviour of this unhappy wretch afforded a dread|ful

<Q REND="inline">"There needs indeed no gho&s;t to tell us

create a new fury to haunt him for his crimes?</P>
<P>LET us, for in&s;tance take a view of the mo&s;t glaring

phantoms that di&s;tracted him on his death-bed. Fir&s;t then, let us
contemplate him as a Parracide; for &s;o he may be called, who by repeated
di&s;|obedience broke the heart of a mo&s;t affectionate father. Could filial
ingratitude receive a &s;harper puni&s;hment, than in the mid&s;t of his
debaucheries to have this father continually before his eyes, expo&s;tulating
with him on his unnatural behaviour? O my &s;on, (might he hear him &s;ay) was
it for 
<Q REND="inline">"this that thy mother, who died in giving thee
life, begged me with her la&s;t breath to be kind to the boy? Was it for this,
that the country rung with joy for my being ble&s;&s;ed with an heir?&mdash;O
my child, who can I now call my heir? That e&s;tate which I was &s;o
&s;ollicitous to improve for thy &s;ake, is di&s;&s;ipated among jockeys,
gamblers, pimps, and pro&s;titutes.&mdash;If you ever &s;hould have a &s;on,
may His ingratitude never make you think of Me."</Q></P>
<P>TOM indeed took care never to have any vexation from children:
He had too great a &s;pirit to bear the &s;hackles of matrimony, and lived in a
&s;tate of celibacy among bagnios. Sometimes he made inroads on private life,
and di&s;turbed the peace of families by debauching the wives and daughters of
his acquaintance. Among other gallant exploits he decoyed up to town the
daughter of a country gentleman, where he ruined her, and then left her to
linger under an infamous di&s;ea&s;e. At length the fruits of his amour
appeared in a child, which &s;oon peri&s;hed with it's unhappy parent in a
public ho&s;pital. By the &s;ame magic of the fancy let us rai&s;e up this poor
girl with the infant in her arms, while he is wantoning among his doxies, and
lording it like a Ba&s;haw over the va&s;&s;als of his lu&s;t. What remor&s;e
mu&s;t this villain have felt, could he have imagined her to have addre&s;&s;ed
him in the following terms! 
<Q REND="inline">"Behold in the loath&s;ome carca&s;e of this
babe the image of thy|&s;elf; <PB N="166" REF="171"> foul, rotten, and
corrupt.&mdash;How could I &s;uffer &s;o contemptible a creature to draw me
from the comfort|able protection of my parents?&mdash;It was ju&s;t that I
&s;hould fall a victim to my folly: but was this di&s;ea&s;ed infant quickened
only to proclaim my di&s;honour and thy in|famy?&mdash;Why had&s;t thou yet the
power left to propagate mi&s;ery even to the innocent?"</Q></P>
<P>TOM had often &s;ignalized him&s;elf as a duelli&s;t: his
con&s;cience, as we have already mentioned, upbraided him at his dying moments
with the murder of a particular friend. He had once ill luck at cards; and
being irritated with his lo&s;&s;es, and &s;u&s;pecting foul play on the part
of his antagoni&s;t, he took him by the no&s;e, which con&s;equently produced a
challenge. He is ha&s;tening to the field of battle:&mdash;but he fancies
him&s;elf followed by the Manes of his friend, whom on the &s;ame unhallowed
ground he had lately &s;acrificed to that Idol HONOUR. He hears him call&mdash;

<Q REND="inline">"Turn, mad|man, turn, and look on Me.&mdash;You
may remember with what reluctance I met you&mdash;You forced me to the
com|bat&mdash;and I was even plea&s;ed that the victory was yours. You deprived
me of life in an idle quarrel about a crea|ture, whom at your return from the
murder of your friend you detected in the arms of another.&mdash;It was Honour
that induced you to wound the bo&s;om of one you loved:&mdash;The &s;ame Honour
now calls you to give a fellow whom you de&s;pi&s;e, an opportunity to
retaliate the injury done to me.&mdash;What folly is it to put your life into
the hands of a &s;coundrel, who you &s;u&s;pect has al|ready robbed you of your
fortune?&mdash;But go on, and let your death rid the world of a mon&s;ter, who
is de&s;perate enough to put his own life on the hazard, and wicked enough to
attempt that of another."</Q>&mdash;It happened, how|ever, that TOM had no
occa&s;ion for &s;uch a monitor, as the <PB N="167" REF="172"> per&s;on whom he
went to meet proved as great a coward as he was a cheat; and our hero, after
waiting a full hour in his pumps, and parrying with the air, had no other
revenge for the lo&s;s of his money than the &s;atisfaction of po&s;ting him
for a &s;coundrel.</P>
<P>THOUGH the hero of our &s;tory was cut off in the prime of his
life, yet he may be &s;aid, like <HI>Ne&s;tor,</HI> to have outlived three
generations. All the young fellows of &s;pirit were proud to be enrolled in the
li&s;t of his companions; but as their con&s;titutions were more puny than his,
three &s;ets of them had dropt into the grave, and left him at the head of the
fourth. He would often boa&s;t of the many promi&s;ing ge|niu&s;&s;es, who had
fallen in the vain attempt of keeping pace with him in the various &s;cenes of
debauchery. In this light we may con&s;ider him as an acce&s;&s;ary to &s;o
many wanton murders. By the operation of his con&s;cience, at every tavern door
he might have met with an acquaintance to bar his pa&s;&s;age; and in the
mid&s;t of his jollity, like <HI>Macbeth,</HI> he would have da&s;hed down his
gla&s;s, and imagined that he &s;aw a departed friend filling the vacant
chair.</P>
<P>FROM the nature of the facts which have already been recorded of
TOM DARE-DEVIL, the reader will ea&s;ily con|clude that he mu&s;t have been an
Athei&s;t. No creature, who believed in a SUPREME BEING, could have acted &s;o
vilely towards his fellow-creatures. TOM was pre&s;ident of an abominable club,
who met together every Sunday night to utter the mo&s;t horrid bla&s;phemies.
The members of this mo&s;t &s;candalous &s;ociety mu&s;t have heard of the
manner of their great tutor's death:&mdash;let us imagine therefore, that they
could figure to them&s;elves his gho&s;t appearing to them, warning them of
their errors, and exhorting them to re|pent. They might conceive him &s;etting
forth, in the mo&s;t pathetic manner, the con&s;equences of their folly, and
declar|ing <PB N="168" REF="173"> to them how convinced he was of the certainty
of tho&s;e doctrines which they daily ridiculed. Such an ap|parition would
indeed have an effect upon common &s;inners; but in all probability a
thorough-paced infidel would not be reclaimed, even 
<Q REND="inline">"though One ro&s;e from the dead."</Q></P>
<P>WHAT I have here &s;uppo&s;ed might have been the ca&s;e of one
particular reprobate, is in the power of every per|&s;on to put in practice for
him&s;elf. Nothing is a &s;tronger in&s;tance of the goodne&s;s of the CREATOR,
than that deli|cate inward feeling, &s;o &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed on every
rea&s;on|able creature. This internal &s;en&s;e, if duly attended to, and
diligently cheri&s;hed and kept alive, would check the &s;inner in his career,
and make him look back with horror on his crimes. An Antient is commended for
wi&s;hing, 
<Q REND="inline">"that he had a window in his brea&s;t, that
every one might &s;ee into it:"</Q> but it is certainly of more con&s;equence
to keep our&s;elves free from the reproach of our own hearts, than from the
evil opinions of others. We &s;hould therefore con&s;ider Con&s;cience as a
Mirror, in which every one may &s;ee him&s;elf reflected, and in which every
action is repre|&s;ented in its proper colours.</P>

<P>_THAT there is a vanity inherent in every author mu&s;t be
confe&s;&s;ed, whatever pains they may take to conceal it from the re&s;t of
mankind. For my own part, I readily acknowledge, that I am always wonder|fully
delighted with my own productions. I &s;natch up the favourite &s;heets wet
from the pre&s;s, and devour every &s;yllable: not the lea&s;t particle
e&s;capes my notice, and I dwell with admiration on the beauties of an
expre&s;&s;ive <HI>and</HI> or emphatical <HI>the.</HI> If every reader was to
pay the &s;ame at|tention <PB N="170" REF="175"> to my works, or peru&s;e them
with half the &s;atis|faction, Mr. TOWN might be fairly pronounced the
greate&s;t author of the age. But I am afraid I &s;hall &s;carce find another
who will &s;o heartily join in the good opinion I have conceived of my&s;elf;
and many a choice &s;enti|ment, many a culled expre&s;&s;ion, which I have
repeated to my&s;elf over and over again with extacy, has by others perhaps
been as ha&s;tily hurried over as any common ar|ticle in a news-paper.</P>
<P>AN Author, who is ever big with the idea of his own importance,
will gather matter for &s;elf-flattery from the mo&s;t trivial circum&s;tances.
On the mornings of publication I have &s;ometimes made it my bu&s;ine&s;s to go
round the coffee hou&s;es, in order to receive whatever increa&s;e of prai&s;e
I could collect from the approbation of my readers. My heart you may imagine
has bounded with joy, when I have heard the room echo with calling for the
CONNOISSEUR: but how has it &s;unk again, when I have found the &s;ame tokens
of e&s;teem &s;hewn to a brother writer! I could have hugged any hone&s;t
fellow, that has chuckled over my performan|ces, and pointed out my good
things:&mdash;but I have been no le&s;s chagrined, when I have &s;een a coxcomb
coolly take up my paper, &s;quint over the fir&s;t page, and throw it down
again with all the indifference imaginable: though indeed I have never failed
within my&s;elf to pronounce on &s;uch a per&s;on, that he is dull, ignorant
and illiterate. I once happened to be &s;eated in the next box to two noted
critics, who were looking over the file of my papers, and &s;eemed particularly
plea&s;ed with &s;everal parts of them. I im|mediately conceived a very high
opinion of their ta&s;te and judgment: I remarked with &s;ingular
&s;atisfaction the effect which my wit and humour had on their countenan|ces; 
<PB N="171" REF="176"> and as they turned over the pages, I imagined I could
point out the very pa&s;&s;ages, which provoked them frequently to &s;mile, and
&s;ometimes to bur&s;t into a loud laugh. As &s;oon as they were gone, I
&s;eized the file; when lo! to my great mortification I found they had been
reading, not my own admirable works, but the lucubrations of a brother
e&s;&s;ayi&s;t.</P>
<P>MY vanity has often prompted me to wi&s;h, that I could
accompany my papers where&s;oever they are circu|lated. I flatter my&s;elf I
&s;hould then be introduced to the polite&s;t men of quality, and admitted into
the clo&s;ets of our fine&s;t ladies. This con&s;ideration would doubtle&s;s
make me vain of my&s;elf: but my pride would be &s;oon checked by reflecting
further, that were I obliged to fol|low my papers afterwards through all their
travels and mutations, I &s;hould certainly undergo the &s;hame of &s;eeing
&s;ome of them pro&s;tituted to the vile&s;t purpo&s;es. If in one place I
might be plea&s;ed to find them the entertainment of the tea-table, in another
I &s;hould be no le&s;s vexed to &s;ee them degraded to the ba&s;e office of
&s;ticking up candles. Such is the fatality attending the&s;e loo&s;e &s;heets,
that though at their fir&s;t publication they may be thought as precious as the
<HI>Sibyl</HI>'s leaves, the next moment they may be thrown a&s;ide as no
better than a la&s;t year's almanack.</P>
<P>EVER &s;ince my fir&s;t appearance in a &s;heet and a half I
have felt great unea&s;ine&s;s on account of the rude treat|ment, which my
works have been &s;ubject to in their pre&s;ent form. I turned off my printer
for a very hei|nous affront offered to my delicacy, having detected &s;ome foul
proofs of my fir&s;t numbers lodged in a very un|&s;eemly <PB N="172" REF="177"> place; and I almo&s;t came to an open rupture with my publi&s;her,
becau&s;e his wife had converted a &s;upernumerary half-&s;heet into a
thread-paper. A lady, who&s;e &s;en&s;e and beauty I had always admired,
forfeited my e&s;teem at once by cutting out a pattern for a cap from one of my
papers; and a young fellow, who had &s;poken very hand&s;omely of one of my
e&s;&s;ays, made no &s;cruple to defile the blank margin with a filthy li&s;t
of foul &s;hirts and dirty &s;tockings. The repeated abu&s;es of illiterate
bakers, pa&s;try-cooks, and chandlers I know I am condemned to &s;uffer in
common with other mor|tal writers. It was ever their priviledge to prey
indi&s;|criminately on all authors good or bad: and as poli|ticians, wits,
freethinkers, and divines, may have their du&s;t mingled in the &s;ame piece of
ground, &s;o may their works be jumbled together in the lining of the &s;ame
trunk or band-box.</P>
<P>ONE in&s;tance may indeed be brought, in which I am u&s;ed to
hail as a lucky omen the damages that my papers appear to have &s;u&s;tained in
their outward form and complexion. With what raptures have I traced the
progre&s;s of my fame, while I have contemplated my numbers in the public
coffee-hou&s;es &s;trung upon a file, and &s;welling gradually into a little
volume! By the appearance which they make, when thus collected, I have often
judged of the reception they have &s;ingly met with from their readers: I have
con&s;idered every &s;peck of dirt as a mark of reputation, and have
a&s;&s;u|med to my&s;elf applau&s;e from the &s;pilling of coffee or the print
of a grea&s;y thumb. In a word, I look upon each paper, when torn and &s;ullied
by frequent hand|ling, as an old &s;oldier battered in the &s;ervice, and
co|vered with honourable &s;cars.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="178">I WAS led into this train of thought by an
accident which happened to me the other evening, as I was walking in &s;ome
fields near the town. As I went along my curio&s;ity tempted me to examine the
materials of which &s;everal paper kites were made up, from whence I had
&s;ufficient room to moralize on the ill fate of authors. On one I di&s;covered
&s;everal pages of a &s;er|mon expanded over the &s;urface; on another the
wings fluttered with love &s;ongs; and a &s;atire on the mini&s;try furni&s;hed
another with balla&s;t for the tail. I at length happened to ca&s;t my eye on
one taller than the re&s;t, and beheld &s;everal of my own darling productions
pa&s;ted over it. My indignation was pre&s;ently rai&s;ed, that I &s;hould
become the plaything of children; and I was even a&s;hamed that the great name
of TOWN, which &s;tared me full in the front, &s;hould be expo&s;ed, like the
compo&s;itions of Dr. <HI>Rock</HI> on the wall, to every idle gazer. However,
by a curious turn of thought I con|verted what at fir&s;t &s;eemed a di&s;grace
into a compliment to my vanity. As the kite ro&s;e into the air, I drew a
flattering parallel between the height of it's flight, and the &s;oaring of my
own reputation: I imagined my&s;elf lifted up on the wings of fame, and like
<HI>Horace</HI>'s Swan towering above mortality: I fancied my|&s;elf borne like
a blazing &s;tar among the clouds, to the admiration of the gazing multitude
below.

<P>_AT a time when Peace &s;preads her downy wings over contending

only to be reviewed, all <HI>Europe</HI> mu&s;t undoubtedly be alarmed to hear
of the bloody battle, which has been lately fought in <HI>England.</HI> It is a

tittle from the ex|pre&s;&s;ive terms in which this extraordinary combat is
related.</P>
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Harl&s;ton in Norfolk, July</HI> 30.
Ye&s;terday in the afternoon <HI>Slack</HI> and <HI>Pettit</HI> met and fought.
At the fir&s;t <HI>Set-to, Pettit</HI> &s;eized <HI>Slack</HI> by the throat,
and held him up again&s;t the rails, and <HI>grain'd</HI> him &s;o much as to
make him turn extremely black: this continued for half a minute before
<HI>Slack</HI> could break <HI>Pettit</HI>'s hold; after which for near ten
minutes <PB N="176" REF="181"> <HI>Pettit</HI> kept fighting and driving hard
at <HI>Slack,</HI> when at length <HI>Slack</HI> clos'd with his antagoni&s;t
and gave him a very &s;evere fall, after that a &s;econd and third; but between
the&s;e falls <HI>Pettit</HI> threw <HI>Slack</HI> twice off the Stage, and
indeed <HI>Pettit</HI> &s;o much dreaded <HI>Slack</HI>'s falls, that he ran
directly at his hams and tumbled him down, and by that means gave
<HI>Slack</HI> an opportu|nity of making the falls very ea&s;y: when they had
been fighting eighteen minutes, the odds ran again&s;t <HI>Slack</HI> a guinea
to a &s;hilling; whereas on fir&s;t &s;etting out, it was three or four to one
on his head; but after this time <HI>Slack &s;hortened Pettit</HI> &s;o, as to
di&s;able him from running and throwing him down in the manner he had done
before, but obliged him to &s;tand to clo&s;e fighting. <HI>Slack</HI> then
clos'd one of his eyes, and beat him very much about the face. At twenty
minutes <HI>Pettit</HI> grew weak|er, <HI>Slack</HI> &s;tronger; this was
occa&s;ion'd by <HI>Slack's &s;trait</HI> way of fighting. At twenty-two
minutes the be&s;t judges allow'd <HI>Slack</HI> to have the advan|tage over
<HI>Pettit</HI> very considerably, as he was then recovering his <HI>Wind,</HI>
which was owing to <HI>Game:</HI> when they had box'd twenty-four mi|nutes,
<HI>Pettit</HI> threw <HI>Slack</HI> again over the rails. This indeed
<HI>Slack</HI> &s;uffered him to do, as by that means he fixed a blow under
<HI>Pettit</HI>'s ribs, that hurt him much. Whil&s;t <HI>Slack</HI> was again
getting upon the &s;tage (it was not half a minute before he was remounted)
<HI>Pettit</HI> had &s;o much the fear of his antagoni&s;t before his eyes,
that he walked off without &s;o much as civilly taking leave of the
&s;pectators, or &s;aying any thing to any per&s;on. This the Cockers call
<HI>roguing of it</HI>; for it is generally thought that <HI>Pettit</HI> ran
away full &s;trong. The whole time of their fighting was twenty-five minutes;
and this morning the BATTLE was given to <HI>Slack,</HI> who drew the fir&s;t
ten guineas out of the box. Thus ended this dreadful combat.</Q>
<P>EVERY man, who has the honour of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> fi&s;t
at heart, mu&s;t look with admiration on the <HI>Bottom,</HI> the
<HI>Wind,</HI> the <HI>Game,</HI> of this invincible champion SLACK. How mu&s;t
they applaud his addre&s;s in <HI>fighting &s;trait</HI>; and with what
dete&s;tation mu&s;t they look upon his da&s;tard antagoni&s;t, who could &s;o
&s;hamefully <HI>rogue it!</HI> Captain <HI>Godfrey,</HI> the &s;ub|lime
Hi&s;torian of the&s;e hardy heroes, would have exclaimed on this
occasion;&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">"Hail, mighty SLACK, thou pride of the Butchers!
Let the &s;hambles echo with thy prai&s;e, and let marrow-bones and cleavers

who is celebrated by the ancients for knocking down an ox, to cut out the hide
into thongs for his <HI>Ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">us?</HI>
every petty &s;laughterman of <HI>Clare-market</HI> can perform greater 
<PB N="177" REF="182"> feats: but thou with re&s;i&s;tle&s;s arm ha&s;t not
only knocked down oxen but made the puny race of barbers, coblers, and watermen
fall before thee."</Q></P>
<P>I CANNOT but lament the cruelty of that law, which has &s;hut up
our Amphitheatres: and I look upon the profe&s;&s;ors of the noble art of
Boxing as a kind of di&s;|banded army, for whom we have made no provi&s;ion.
The mechanics, who at the call of glory left their mean occu|pations, are now
obliged to have recour&s;e to them again; and coachmen and barbers re&s;ume the
whip and the razor, in&s;tead of giving black eyes and cro&s;s-buttocks. I know
a veteran that has often <HI>won the whole hou&s;e,</HI> who is reduced, like
<HI>Beli&s;arius,</HI> to &s;pread his palm in begging for a half|penny. Some
have been forced to exerci&s;e their art in knocking down pa&s;&s;engers in
dark alleys and corners; while others have learned to open their fi&s;ts and
ply their fingers in picking pockets. <HI>Buckhor&s;e,</HI> who&s;e knuckles
had been u&s;ed to indent many a brui&s;e, now clenches them only to gra&s;p a
link; and <HI>Broughton</HI> employs the mu&s;cles of his brawny arm in
&s;queezing a lemon or drawing a cork. His Amphitheatre it&s;elf is converted
into a Methodi&s;t Meeting|hou&s;e! and perhaps (as laymen are there admitted
into the pulpit) tho&s;e very fi&s;ts, which &s;o lately dealt &s;uch hearty
bangs upon the &s;tage, are now with equal vehemence thumping the
cu&s;hion.</P>
<P>THE dextrous u&s;e of the fi&s;t is a truly <HI>Briti&s;h</HI>
exerci&s;e: and the &s;turdy <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have been as much renowned for
their Boxing as their Beef; both which are by no means &s;uited to the watry
&s;tomachs and weak &s;inews of their enemies the <HI>French.</HI> To this
nutriment and this art is owing that long-e&s;tabli&s;hed maxim, that one
<HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> can beat three <HI>Frenchmen.</HI> A <HI>Frenchman,</HI>
who piddles on <PB N="178" REF="183"> a frica&s;&s;ee of frogs, can no more
encounter with an <HI>En|gli&s;hman,</HI> who feeds upon beef, than the frog in
the fable could &s;well her little body to the &s;ize of an ox; and from hence
we may conclude, on the principles of philo&s;ophy, that the ela&s;tic
&s;pring, which darts from the knuckles of an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> falls into
the heels of a <HI>Frenchman.</HI> One of my corre&s;pondents has already
remon&s;trated again&s;t the degeneracy of the pre&s;ent times in our
&s;hameful neglect of that &s;upport of our national &s;trength, Old
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Roa&s;t Beef. Indeed we can never hope, that any of our
modern heroes would attempt to <HI>fix a blow under the ribs,</HI> when they
are afraid of plunging a knife into a Surloin: and I will venture to &s;ay,
that when the times come, that Sur|loins are no more brought upon the table, we
&s;hall not be able to produce one <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> who can knock down an
ox.</P>
<P>OUR pre&s;ent race of &s;pindle-&s;hanked beaux had rather
clo&s;e with an orange wench at the playhou&s;e, than engage in a bye battle at
<HI>Tottenham Court.</HI> It is therefore no wonder, that they &s;hould object
to this manly practice, for which they are &s;o ill fitted. How can we imagine,
that they could &s;tand again&s;t the buffets of a brui&s;er, when they might
almo&s;t be patted down with the fan of a lady? An attempt was once made by
<HI>Broughton</HI> to bring this &s;tudy into vogue, by e&s;tabli&s;hing a
School for Boxing, in which he him&s;elf was to be the Lecturer. He invited the
young gen|tlemen of the army, and all other men of &s;pirit, to engage under
his directions; and promi&s;ed to arm their feeble wri&s;ts with mufflers, &s;o
that nothing might be apprehended by the &s;ofte&s;t head or tendere&s;t
&s;kin. A few indeed were hardy enough to try a fall with him: but mo&s;t of
our young fellows gave up the gauntlet for &s;cented gloves; and loathing the
mutton fi&s;ts of vulgar carmen and porters, they rather cho&s;e to hang their
hands in a &s;ling, to make them <PB N="179" REF="184"> white and delicate as a
lady's. I cannot but regret, that this de&s;ign was not generally encouraged,
as it might per|haps have aboli&s;hed almo&s;t the only u&s;e, that is at
pre&s;ent made of the &s;word; and men of honour, in&s;tead of tilting at each
other, might have had &s;atisfacion in a tight <HI>Set-to</HI> behind
<HI>Mountague Hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>THE amu&s;ement of Boxing I mu&s;t confe&s;s is more immediately
calculated for the vulgar, who can have no reli&s;h for the more refined
plea&s;ures of whi&s;t and the hazard table. Men of fa&s;hion have found out a
more genteel employment for their hands in &s;huffling a pack of cards and
&s;haking the dice: and indeed it will appear upon a &s;trict review, that
mo&s;t of our fa&s;hionable diver&s;ions are nothing el&s;e but different
branches of gaming. What lady would be able to boa&s;t a route at her hou&s;e
con&s;i&s;ting of three or four hundred per&s;ons, if they were not to be drawn
together by the charms of playing a rubber? and the prohibition of our jubilee
ma&s;querades is hardly to be regretted, as they wanted the mo&s;t
e&s;&s;ential part of their entertainments, the E. O. table. To this polite
&s;pirit of gaming, which has diffu&s;ed it&s;elf through all the fashion|able
world, is owing the va&s;t encouragement that is given to the Turf; and
hor&s;e-races are e&s;teemed only as they afford occa&s;ion for making a bet.
The &s;ame &s;pirit like|wi&s;e draws the knowing ones together in a Cock-pit;
and cocks are re&s;cued from the dunghill, and armed with gaffles, to furni&s;h
a new &s;pecies of gaming. For this rea&s;on among others I cannot but regret
the lo&s;s of our ele|gant amu&s;ements in <HI>Oxford Road</HI> and
<HI>Tottenham Court.</HI> A great part of the &s;pectators u&s;ed to be deeply
inte|re&s;ted in what was doing on the &s;tage, and were as earne&s;t to make
an advantage of the i&s;&s;ue of the battle, <PB N="180" REF="185"> as the
champions them&s;elves to draw the large&s;t &s;um from the box. The
Amphitheatre was at once a &s;chool for boxing and gaming. Many thou&s;ands
have depended upon a match; the odds have often ri&s;en at a black eye; a large
bet has been occa&s;ioned by a cro&s;s-buttock: and while the hou&s;e has
re&s;ounded with the lu&s;ty bangs of the combatants, it has at the &s;ame time
echoed with the cries of <HI>five to one, &s;ix to one, ten to one.</HI></P>
<P>THE lo&s;s of this branch of gaming is a public cala|mity; and I
doubt not but the gentlemen at <HI>White</HI>'s, and all others whom it
concerns, will u&s;e their endeavours to have it re&s;tored. The many plates
given all over the kingdom have undoubtedly improved our breed of hor&s;es; and
if the diver&s;ion of Boxing was to meet with equal encouragement, we &s;hould
certainly have a more &s;tout and hardy race of brui&s;ers. It might perhaps
become a fa&s;hion for gentlemen, who were fond of the &s;port, to keep
cham|pions in training, put them in &s;weats, diet them, and breed up the human
&s;pecies with the &s;ame care as they do cocks and hor&s;es. In cour&s;e of
time this branch of gaming, like all others, would doubtle&s;s be reduced to a
&s;cience; and <HI>Broughton,</HI> in imitation of that great genius
<HI>Hoyle,</HI> might oblige the public with a Treati&s;e on the Fi&s;t, and
Calculations for laying the Odds at any Match of Boxing.</P>

<P>_LOOKING over the letters, with which I have been lately
favoured by my corres|pondents, I was a good deal plea&s;ed with the following.
I &s;hall therefore pre&s;ent it to the reader this day.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU mu&s;t have ob&s;erved a paragraph in the news|papers
dated from <HI>Dublin,</HI> which informs us, that 
<Q REND="inline">"the &s;pirit of Duelling is now become &s;o
common, that &s;carce a day pa&s;&s;es without one or more being fought in or
near that Metropolis."</Q> I am very much alarmed le&s;t this madne&s;s
&s;hould cro&s;s the &s;eas: to &s;ay the truth, I al|mo&s;t begin to think it
nece&s;&s;ary, that the frequent impor|tation <PB N="182" REF="187"> of
<HI>Iri&s;hmen</HI> into this kingdom &s;hould, for &s;ome time, be prohibited;
and an embargo laid on tho&s;e &s;hips that are freighted with contraband
Duelli&s;ts. The ladies perhaps may object to this propo&s;al, but it is your
duty, Mr. TOWN, at lea&s;t to do all in your power to prevent the influence
which the conduct of the&s;e heroic gentlemen, who cannot &s;uffer their
&s;words to &s;leep quietly in their &s;cabbards, may have on our young
fellows: I mu&s;t therefore beg of you to put together a few thoughts on this
occa&s;ion, and though the &s;ubject has been often treated before, I cannot
but ima|gine that there is &s;ufficient room left for You to expatiate on it.
It is u&s;ual among the Bi&s;hops, when they find any particular vice prevail,
to &s;end orders to the Clergy of their re&s;pective dioce&s;es to preach
again&s;t it. In like manner it is your duty, as CENSOR GENERAL, to attack the
reigning follies: and it is &s;urely as ea&s;y for You to throw them into a new
light, as it is for the Clergy to preach different &s;ermons on the &s;ame
text.</P>
<P>YOU will undoubtedly agree with me that Gaming is one of the
principal cau&s;es of Duels, and that many a young fellow has owed his death to
cards and dice. As the gaming-hou&s;es are often filled with rogues in lace and
&s;harpers in embroidery, an hone&s;t but ra&s;h adventurer often lo&s;es his
temper with his money, and begins to &s;u&s;pect that the cards are packed, or
the dice loaded: and then very wi&s;ely ri&s;ks his life becau&s;e he finds it
impo&s;&s;ible to re|cover his ca&s;h. Upon this account I am never witne&s;s
to deep play, but it rai&s;es very &s;erious reflections in me. When I have
&s;een a young nobleman offer a large &s;take, I have con&s;idered him as
&s;etting his life upon a card, or (like King <HI>Richard)</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"laying it upon a ca&s;t, and &s;tanding the
hazard of the die."</Q> I have even imagined that I heard bullets rattle in the
dice-box, and that I &s;aw challenges written upon every card on the table.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="188">THE ladies al&s;o are frequently the
cau&s;e of Duels; though it mu&s;t be owned, in ju&s;tice to the better part of
the &s;ex, that where one is fought on account of a mode&s;t woman, ten are
occa&s;ioned by pro&s;titutes. The &s;tout knights-errant, who entertain a
pa&s;&s;ion for the faith|le&s;s <HI>Dulcineas</HI> of <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> and
<HI>Covent-Garden,</HI> find frequent opportunities of manife&s;ting their
prowe&s;s. They not only encounter with bullies and bravoes, but &s;ome|times
meet with other enamoratoes as fond and as mad as them&s;elves. I am
per&s;onally acquainted with two gen|tlemen of this turn, who held out
pi&s;tols at each other acro&s;s a bed at one of the&s;e ladies lodgings, and
to&s;&s;ed up which &s;hould fire fir&s;t. The pi&s;tol however luckily mi&s;t
fire, and gave them time to think better of it: &s;o they very amicably &s;hook
hands, laid down their pi&s;tols, and went to bed to the lady together. The&s;e
females are not content, it &s;eems, with the conque&s;ts commonly made by the
fair, but often pa&s;s a more cruel &s;entence on their captives. Their lovers
not only &s;uffer tho&s;e meta|phorical deaths which all their tribe mu&s;t
endure, but are often really killed in &s;erious truth and &s;ober &s;adne&s;s.
They are not only &s;hot through the heart by an accidental glance of the eyes,
but often have a brace of balls lodged in their heads; and are not only 
<Q REND="inline">"&s;tabbed through the liver (as
<HI>Mercutio</HI> has it) by the blind bow-boy's butt-&s;haft,"</Q> but they
may perhaps be engaged in a duel with a rival, in which they are run through
the body.</P>
<P>A FOREIGN Count was once challenged by one of the&s;e
hot-headed gentlemen, and I &s;hall conclude my letter by recommending his
method to our modern Dueli&s;ts. The place of battle appointed was the Count's
hou&s;e, and when the furious challenger came in, breathing nothing but
re|venge, he was &s;urprized to find the Count &s;itting very 
<PB N="184" REF="189"> compo&s;edly with a candle and a barrel at his &s;ide. 
<Q REND="inline">"This, Sir, &s;aid the Count, is a barrel of
gunpowder, and if you plea&s;e we will take our chance who &s;hall &s;et fire
to it, you or I."</Q> The gentleman amazed at this expe|dient made no an&s;wer;
upon which the Count lighted a match, and waving it over the mouth of the
barrel, cried out, 
<Q REND="inline">"Get out of the room, Sir, or I will &s;et
fire to the powder this in&s;tant."</Q> This abated our challeger's wrath &s;o
con&s;iderably, that the Count was rid of him in a moment, and he was glad to
leave the room without any &s;atisfac|tion.&mdash;I &s;hall expect &s;omething
from you on this &s;ubject and am,</P>
<CLOSER>
<SALUTE>Sir!</SALUTE> 
<SIGNED>your humble &s;ervant, EPHRAIM
MAKEPEACE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>I SHALL not refu&s;e my corre&s;pondent my animadver&s;ions on
this &s;ubject, but as I am not inclined to mea&s;ure &s;words on this
occa&s;ion with any of my predece&s;&s;ors or cotempo|raries, I &s;hall
expatiate in an entire new field, and appear in the cau&s;e as an advocate for
Duelling. The vices and follies of the fa&s;hionable world are &s;o connected
with each other, that they almo&s;t form a regular &s;y&s;tem, and the
prac|tice of them all is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to complete the cha|racter
of a Fine Gentleman. A Fine Gentleman (in the modern &s;en&s;e of the word) is
one that whores, games, and wears a &s;word. Running after loo&s;e women is
indeed in &s;ome mea&s;ure common to this exhalted part of mankind with the
vulgar: but to live in bagnios, to be kept in repair by <HI>Rock</HI> or
<HI>Ward</HI> by the quarter, to be in a continual cour&s;e of pill and
electuary, and to make a bu&s;ine&s;s of fornication is the peculiar privilege
of a Fine Gentleman. Gaming is al&s;o an e&s;&s;ential requi&s;ite to this
character, and is indeed capable of it&s;elf to create a per&s;on a Gentleman
who has no other preten&s;ions to that title. The greate&s;t &s;coundrels
pro|vided <PB N="185" REF="190"> they were game&s;ters, have always been
permitted to a&s;&s;ociate with people of fa&s;hion; and perhaps they hold
their title to the be&s;t company by the &s;ame tenure that the Knaves keep
their rank among the honours in a pack of cards. But the grand
di&s;tingui&s;hing mark of a Fine Gen|tleman is the wearing a &s;word.
Gentility di&s;plays it&s;elf in a well-fancied &s;word-knot, and honour lies
&s;heathed in the &s;cabbard. All who bear arms have a claim to this
charac|ter: even our common &s;oldiers (like the knights of old) are dubbed
Gentlemen on the &s;houlder with this only difference, that in&s;tead of the
&s;word, the ceremony is performed by a brown mu&s;ket.</P>
<P>UPON the&s;e and many other weighty con&s;iderations I have
re&s;olved not to di&s;turb the tranquility of the polite world by railing at
their darling vices. A CENSOR may endeavour to new-cock a hat, to rai&s;e the
&s;tays, or write down the &s;hort petticoat, at his plea&s;ure. Per&s;ons of
quality will vary fa&s;hions of them&s;elves, but will always adhere &s;teadily
to their vices. I have lately received &s;everal letters from &s;ur|geons and
younger brothers de&s;iring me to promote as far as lays in my power the modern
way of life, and e&s;pecially the practice of Duelling. The former open their
ca&s;e in the mo&s;t pathetic terms, and a&s;&s;ure me that if it was not for
Duels, and the amorous rencontres of Fine Gentlemen with the other &s;ex, their
profe&s;&s;ion would &s;carce &s;upport them. As to the young gentlemen they
inveigh bitterly again&s;t the une|qual distribution of property by the laws of
<HI>England,</HI> and offer me very con&s;iderable bribes if I will e&s;pou&s;e
the cau&s;e of Duels and Debauchey; without which they &s;carce have any
tolerable chance of coming in for the family e&s;tate.</P>
<P>SWIFT &s;omewhere ob&s;erves that tho&s;e differences very
rarely happen among men of &s;en&s;e, and he does not &s;ee any great harm, if
two worthle&s;s fellows &s;end each other out of the world. I &s;hall therefore
humbly propo&s;e, the more ef|fectually to keep up this &s;pirit, that Duels
may be included in the Licence-Act among our other public diver&s;ions, with 
<PB N="186" REF="191"> a re&s;training clau&s;e taking away all power from the
Ju&s;tices to prohibit the&s;e entertainments. I would al&s;o propo&s;e, for
the better accommodation of the public, that &s;caffolds be erected behind
<HI>Montague Hou&s;e,</HI> or in any other convenient place, as there are now
at <HI>Tyburn</HI>; and that whenever any two Gentlemen quarrel, they &s;hall
in&s;ert their challenges in the Daily Papers after the following manner in
imitation of the late champions at <HI>Broughton</HI>'s.</P>

<P>_THE following letter will, I fear, di&s;oblige a great many of

inoffen&s;ive; though like all others it may &s;ometimes be indulged to an

corre&s;pondent to &s;peak for him&s;elf.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I KNOW not whether you your&s;elf are addicted to a filthy
practice, which is frequent among all ranks of people, though dete&s;table even
among the lowe&s;t. The practice I mean is that of &s;nuff-taking; which I
cannot help regarding as a national plague, that like another epidemical
di&s;temper <PB N="188" REF="193"> has taken hold of our no&s;es. You authors
may perhaps claim it as a priviledge, &s;ince &s;nuff is &s;uppo&s;ed by you to
whet the invention, and every one is not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of BAYES's admirable
receipt, the "Spirit of Brains:"&mdash;but give me leave to tell you, that
&s;nuff &s;hould no more be admini&s;tered in public, than that of
<HI>Major</HI>'s medicinal compo&s;ition at fourpence a pinch, or any other
do&s;e of phy&s;ick. I know not why people &s;hould be allowed to annoy their
friends and acquaintance by &s;mearing their no&s;es with a dirty pow|der, any
more than in u&s;ing an eye-water, or rubbing their teeth with a
dentifrice.</P>
<P>IF a &s;tranger to this na&s;ty cu&s;tom was to ob&s;erve
almo&s;t every one 
<Q REND="inline">"drawing out his pouncet-box, and ever and
anon giving it to his no&s;e,"</Q> he would be led to conclude, that we were no
better than a nation of <HI>Hottentots</HI>; and that every one was obliged to
cram his no&s;trils with a quantity of &s;cented dirt, to fence them from the
di&s;agree|able effluvias of the re&s;t of the company. Indeed it might not be
ab&s;urd in &s;uch a &s;tranger to imagine, that the per&s;on he conver&s;ed
with took &s;nuff, for the &s;ame rea&s;on that another might pre&s;s his
no&s;trils together between his finger and thumb, to exclude an ill
&s;mell.</P>
<P>IT is cu&s;tomary among tho&s;e polite people the
<HI>Dutch,</HI> to carry with them every where their &s;hort dingy pipes, and
&s;moak and &s;pit about a room even in the pre&s;ence of ladies. This piece of
good-breeding, however ridiculous it may &s;eem, is not &s;urely more
offen&s;ive to good manners than the practice of &s;nuff-taking: a very
<HI>Dutchman</HI> would think it odd, that a people who pretend to politene&s;s
&s;hould be continually &s;nuffing up a parcel of tobacco du&s;t; nor can I
help laughing, when I &s;ee a man every minute &s;tealing out a dirty
muckender, then &s;neaking it in again, as much <PB N="189" REF="194">
a&s;hamed of his pocket companion, as he would be to carry a di&s;hclout about
him.</P>
<P>IT is indeed impo&s;&s;ible to go into any large company
without being di&s;turbed by this abominable practice. The church and the
playhou&s;e continually echoe with this mu|&s;ick of the no&s;e, and in every
corner you may hear them in concert &s;nuffling, &s;neezing, hawking, and
grunting like a drove of hogs. The mo&s;t pathetic &s;peech in a tragedy has
been interrupted by the blowing of no&s;es in the front and &s;ide boxes; and I
have known a whole congregation &s;uddenly rai&s;ed from their knees in the
middle of a prayer by the violent coughing of an old lady, who has been
almo&s;t choaked by a pinch of &s;nuff in giving vent to an ejacula|tion. A
celebrated actor has &s;poiled his voice by this ab&s;urd treatment of his
no&s;e, which has made his articulation like the hum of a bag-pipe; and the
par&s;on of our pari&s;h is often forced to break off in the middle of a period
to &s;nort behind his white handkerchief.</P>
<P>IS it not a wonder, Mr. TOWN, that &s;nuff, which is
cer|tainly an enemy to dre&s;s, &s;hould yet gain admittance among tho&s;e who
have no other merit than their cloaths? I am not to be told, that your men of
fa&s;hion take &s;nuff only to di&s;play a white hand perhaps, or the
brilliancy of a dia|mond ring: and I am confident that numbers would never have
defiled them&s;elves with the u&s;e of &s;nuff, had they not been &s;educed by
the charms of a fa&s;hionable box. The man of ta&s;te takes his
<HI>Stra&s;burgh veritable tabac</HI> from a right <HI>Paris</HI> paper-box,
and the pretty fellow u&s;es a box of po|li&s;hed metal, that by often opening
it he may have the op|portunity of &s;tealing a glance at his own &s;weet
per&s;on reflected in the lid of it.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="195">THOUGH I abhor &s;nuff-taking my&s;elf,
and would as &s;oon be &s;mothered in a cloud rai&s;ed by &s;moking tobacco as
I would willingly &s;uffer the lea&s;t atom of it to tickle my no&s;e, yet am I
expo&s;ed to many di&s;gu&s;ting inconveniences from the u&s;e of it by others.
Sometimes I am choaked by drawing in with my breath &s;ome of the fine&s;t
particles together with the air; and I am frequently &s;et a &s;neezing by the
odo|rous effluvias ari&s;ing from the boxes that &s;urround me. But it is not
only my olfactory &s;en&s;e that is offended: you will &s;tare when I tell you,
that I am forced to ta&s;te, and even to eat and drink this abominable &s;nuff.
If I drink tea with a certain lady, I generally perceive what e&s;capes from
her fingers &s;wimming at the top of my cup; but it is always attributed to the
foulne&s;s of the milk or dro&s;s of the &s;ugar: I never dine at a particular
friend's hou&s;e, but I am &s;ure to have as much rappee as pepper with my
turnips; nor can I drink my table-beer out of the &s;ame mug with him, for fear
of coughing from his &s;nuff, if not the liquor, going the wrong way. Such
eternal &s;nuff-takers as my friend &s;hould, I think, at meal-times have a
&s;creen flapping down over the no&s;e and mouth, under which they might convey
their food, as you may have &s;een at the Ma&s;querade: at lea&s;t they
&s;hould be &s;eparated from the re&s;t of the company, and placed by
them&s;elves at the &s;ide-table like the children.</P>
<P>THIS practice of &s;nuff-taking, however inexcu&s;able in the
men, is &s;till more abominable in the other &s;ex. Neat|ne&s;s and
cleanline&s;s ought to be always cultivated among the women; but nothing is
more oppo&s;ite to clean linnen than this trick of bedawbing them&s;elves with
&s;nuff. I have with pain ob&s;erved the &s;now-white &s;urface of an
handkerchief or apron &s;ullied with the &s;catterings from the &s;nuff-box;
and whenever I &s;ee a lady be&s;meared thus with <HI>Scotch</HI> or
<HI>Havan|nah,</HI> I con&s;ider her as no cleanlier than the kitchen wench 
<PB N="191" REF="196"> &s;couring her bra&s;&s;es, and begrimed with
brickdu&s;t and ful|ler's earth. Hou&s;ewifely accompli&s;hments are at
pre&s;ent &s;eldom required in a well-bred woman: or el&s;e I &s;hould little
expect to find notablene&s;s in a wife who keeps up &s;uch a con&s;tant
corre&s;pondence between her fingers and no&s;e; nor indeed would any one think
her hands at all fit to be employed in making a pudding.</P>
<P>IT &s;hould be remembered by the younger part of your fair
readers, Mr. TOWN, that &s;nuff is an implacable enemy to the complexion, which
in time is &s;ure to take a tinge from it: they &s;hould therefore be as
cautious of acquiring a &s;allow hue from this bane of a fair &s;kin, as of
being tanned or freckled by expo&s;ing their delicate faces to the &s;corching
rays of the &s;un. Be&s;ides, as the no&s;e has been always reck|oned a
principal if not the chief ornament of the face, they &s;hould be as careful to
pre&s;erve the beauty of it as of any other feature, and not &s;uffer it to be
undermined or bloated by &s;o pernicious an application as &s;nuff-taking. For
my own part, I &s;hould as &s;oon admire a celebrated toa&s;t with no no&s;e at
all, as to &s;ee it pro&s;tituted to &s;o vile a purpo&s;e. They &s;hould
al&s;o con&s;ider, that the no&s;e is &s;ituated very near the lips: and what
reli&s;h can a lover find in the honey of the latter, if at the &s;ame time he
is obliged to come into clo&s;e contact with the former. Rather than
&s;nuff-taking &s;hould prevail among the ladies, I could wi&s;h it were the
fa&s;hion for them to wear rings in their no&s;es like the &s;avage nations:
nay, I would even carry it &s;till farther, and oblige tho&s;e pretty females,
who could be &s;till &s;laves to &s;nuff, to have their no&s;trils bored
through as well their ears, and in|&s;tead of jewels to bear rolls of pigtail
bobbing over their upper lips.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="197">WE cannot otherwi&s;e account for this
fa&s;hion among the women &s;o unnatural to their &s;ex, than that they want
em|ployment for their hands. It was formerly no reflection for a young lady to
be &s;een in the be&s;t company bu&s;ied with her work: but a girl now a days
would as &s;oon be &s;urprized in twirling a &s;pinning wheel as in handling a
thread-paper. The fan or the &s;nuff-box are now the only implements they dare
to u&s;e in publick: yet &s;urely it would be much more becoming to have the
fore-finger pricked and &s;carified with the point of a needle, than to &s;ee
it embrowned with &s;queezing together a filthy pinch of &s;nuff.</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;aid enough, I dare &s;ay, already to make many of
your readers turn up their no&s;es at me in di&s;dain; but however let them
<HI>take &s;nuff</HI> as much as they will, you may depend on the good word of
one at lea&s;t, and that is</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I REMEMBER to have &s;een a little <HI>French</HI> Novel
giving an account of a citizen of <HI>Paris</HI> making an excur&s;ion into the
country. He imagines him&s;elf about to undertake a long voyage to &s;ome
&s;trange region, where the natives were as different from the inhabitants of
his own city as the mo&s;t di&s;tant nations. He accordingly takes boat, and is
landed at a villiage about a league from the capital. When he is &s;et on
&s;hore, he is amazed to find the people <PB N="194" REF="199"> talk the &s;ame
language, wear the &s;ame dre&s;s, and u&s;e the &s;ame cu&s;toms with
him&s;elf. He who had &s;pent all his life within the &s;ight of <HI>Pont
Neuf,</HI> looked upon every one who lived out of <HI>Paris</HI> as a
foreigner; and though the utmo&s;t extent of his travels was not three miles,
he was as much &s;urprized, as he would have been to meet with a colony of
<HI>Frenchmen</HI> on the <HI>Terra Incognita.</HI></P>
<P>MOST of our late novels are, with &s;ome little variation of
circum&s;tances, borrowed from the <HI>French:</HI> but if we &s;hould
endeavour to adapt the novel I have been &s;peaking of to a citizen of
<HI>London,</HI> the humour of the whole piece would evaporate, and the fiction
become unnatural and improbable. A <HI>London</HI> trade&s;man is as well
acquainted with <HI>Turnham-Green</HI> or <HI>Kenti&s;h-Town</HI> as
<HI>Fleet-&s;treet</HI> or <HI>Cheap&s;ide,</HI> and talks as familiarly of
<HI>Richmond</HI> or <HI>Hampton-Court</HI> as of the <HI>Change</HI> or the
<HI>Cu&s;tom Hou&s;e.</HI> In your late paper On the Amu&s;ements of Sunday you
have &s;et forth in what manner our citizens pa&s;s that day, which mo&s;t of
them devote to the country: but I wi&s;h you had been more particular in your
de&s;crip|tions of tho&s;e elegant rural man&s;ions, which at once &s;hew the
opulence and the ta&s;te of our principal merchants, me|chanics, and
artificers.</P>
<P>IN the&s;e du&s;ty retreats, where the want of <HI>London</HI>
&s;moke is &s;upplied by the &s;moke of <HI>Virginia</HI> tobacco, our chief
citi|zens are accu&s;tomed to pa&s;s the end and the beginning of every week.
Their Boxes (as they are mode&s;tly called) are generally built in a row, to
re&s;emble as much as po&s;&s;ible the &s;treets in <HI>London.</HI> Tho&s;e
edifices which &s;tand &s;ingle, and at a di&s;tance from the road, have always
a &s;ummer-hou&s;e at the end of a &s;mall garden; which being erected upon a
wall adjoining to the highway commands a view of every carriage, and gives the
owner an opportunity of di&s;playing <PB N="195" REF="200"> his be&s;t wig to
every pa&s;&s;enger. A little artificial fountain, &s;pouting water &s;ometimes
to the amazing height of four feet and in which frogs &s;upply the want of
fi&s;hes, is one of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite ornaments in the&s;e gardens. There
are be|&s;ides (if the &s;pot of ground allows &s;ufficient &s;pace for them)
very curious &s;tatues of <HI>Harlequin, Scaramouch, Pierrot,</HI> and
<HI>Columbine,</HI> which &s;erve to remind their wives and daughters of what
they have &s;een at the play-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I WENT la&s;t Sunday, in compliance with a mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing
invitation from a friend, to &s;pend the whole day with him at one of the&s;e
little &s;eats, which he had fitted up for his retirement once a week from
bu&s;ine&s;s. It is plea&s;antly &s;itua|ted about three miles from
<HI>London,</HI> on the &s;ide of a public road, from which it is &s;eparated
by a dry ditch, over which is a little bridge confirming of two narrow planks,
leading to the hou&s;e. The hedge on the other &s;ide the road cuts off all
pro&s;pect what&s;oever, except from the garrets, from whence indeed you have a
beautiful vi&s;ta of two men hang|ing in chains on <HI>Kennington</HI> Common,
with a di&s;tant view of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Cupola enveloped in a cloud of
&s;moke. I &s;et out on my vi&s;it betimes in the morning, accompanied with my
friend's book-keeper, who was my guide, and carried over with him the
<HI>London Evening Po&s;t,</HI> his mi&s;tre&s;s's hoop, and a dozen of pipes,
which they were afraid to tru&s;t in the chair. When I came to the end of my
walk, I found my friend &s;itting at the door in a black velvet cap, &s;moking
his morning pipe. He welcomed me into the country, and after having made me
ob&s;erve the turnpike on my left and the <HI>Golden Wheat&s;heaf</HI> on my
right, he conducted me into his hou&s;e, where I was received by his lady, who
made a thou|&s;and apologies for being catched in &s;uch a di&s;habille.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="201">THE hall (for &s;o I was taught to call
it) had its white wall almo&s;t hid by a curious collection of prints and
paintings. On one &s;ide was a large map of <HI>London,</HI> a plan and
elevation of the Man&s;ion-Hou&s;e, with &s;everal le&s;&s;er views of the
pub|lic buildings and halls; on the other was the Death of the Stag by the
happy pencil of Mr. <HI>Henry Overton,</HI> finely coloured: clo&s;e by the
parlour door there hung a pair of &s;tag's horns, over which there was laid
acro&s;s a red Roccelo and an amber-headed cane. When I had declared all this
to be mighty pretty, I was &s;hewn into the parlour, and was pre&s;ently
a&s;ked, who that was over the chimney-piece. I pronounced it to be a very
&s;triking likene&s;s of my friend, who was drawn bolt upright in a
full-bottomed perriwig, a laced cravat with the fringed ends appearing thro' a
button|hole, a black livery gown, a &s;nuff-coloured velvet coat with gold
buttons, a red velvet wai&s;tcoat trimmed with gold, one hand &s;tuck in the
bo&s;om of his &s;hirt, and the other holding out a letter with the
&s;uper&s;cription&mdash;<HI>To Mr. &mdash; Common-Council-Man of Faringdon
Ward Without.</HI> My eyes were then directed to another figure in a &s;carlet
gown, who I was informed was my friend's wife's great great uncle, and had been
&s;heriff and knighted in the reign of King <HI>James</HI> the fir&s;t. Madam
her&s;elf filled up a pannel on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, in the habit of a
&s;hepherde&s;s, &s;melling to a no&s;egay, and &s;troking a ram with gilt
horns.</P>
<P>I WAS then invited by my friend to &s;ee what he was plea&s;ed
to call his garden, which was nothing more than a yard about twenty feet in
length, and contained about a dozen little pots ranged on each &s;ide with
lillies and coxcombs, &s;upported by &s;ome old laths painted green, with bowls
of tobacco-pipes on their tops. At the end of this garden he bade me take
notice of a little &s;quare building &s;urrounded <PB N="197" REF="202"> with
filleroy, which he told me an Alderman of great ta&s;te had turned into a
Temple, by erecting &s;ome battlements and &s;pires of painted wood on the
front of it; but concluded with an hint, that I might retire to it upon
occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>AFTER dinner, when my friend had fini&s;hed his pipe, he
propo&s;ed taking a walk, that we might enjoy a little of the country: &s;o I
was obliged to trudge along the foot path by the road-&s;ide, while my friend
went puffing and blowing, with his hat in his hand, and his wig half off his
head. At la&s;t I told him it was time for me to return home, when he
in&s;i&s;ted on going with me as far as the half-way hou&s;e, to drink a
decanter of Stingo before we parted. We here fell into company with a brother
liveryman of the &s;ame ward, and I left them both together in an high
di&s;pute about <HI>Can|ning</HI>; but not before my friend had made me
promi&s;e to repeat my vi&s;it to his country-hou&s;e the next Sunday.</P>
<P>AS the riches of a country are vi&s;ible in the number of its
inhabitants, and the elegance of their dwellings, we may venture to &s;ay that
the pre&s;ent &s;tate of <HI>England</HI> is very flou|ri&s;hing and
pro&s;perous: and if the ta&s;te for building encrea&s;es with our opulence for
the next century, we &s;hall be able to boa&s;t of finer country &s;eats
belonging to our &s;hop-keepers, artificers, and other plebeians, than the
mo&s;t pompous de|&s;criptions of <HI>Italy</HI> or <HI>Greece</HI> have ever
recorded. We read it is true of country-&s;eats, belonging to <HI>Pliny,
Horten&s;ius, Lucullus,</HI> and other <HI>Romans.</HI> They were patricians of
great rank and fortune: there can therefore be no doubt of the excellence of
their <HI>Villas.</HI> But who has ever read of a <HI>Chine&s;e</HI>-bridge
belonging to a <HI>roman</HI> pa&s;try-cook? or could any of their Shoemakers
or taylors boa&s;t a <HI>Villa</HI> with his tin ca&s;cades, paper &s;tatutes,
and <HI>Gothic</HI> root-hou&s;es? Upon <PB N="198" REF="203"> the above
principles we may expect, that po&s;terity will perhaps &s;ee a chee&s;monger's
<HI>Apiarium</HI> at <HI>Brentford,</HI> a poul|terer's <HI>Theriotrophium</HI>
at <HI>Chi&s;wick,</HI> and an <HI>Ornithon</HI> in a fi&s;hmonger's garden at
<HI>Putney.</HI></P>
<P>AS a patriot and an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> I cannot but wi&s;h,
that each &s;ucce&s;&s;ive century &s;hould encrea&s;e the opulence of
<HI>Great Britain:</HI> but I &s;hould be &s;orry, that this abundance of
wealth &s;hould induce our good citizens to turn their thoughts too much upon
the country. At pre&s;ent we are deprived of our mo&s;t eminent trade&s;men two
days out of &s;ix. It is true the &s;hopkeeper and the travelling part of his
family, con&s;i&s;t|ing generally of him&s;elf, his wife, and his two elde&s;t
daugh|ters, are &s;eldom &s;ufficiently equipped to take leave of
<HI>London,</HI> till about three o'clock on Saturday in the afternoon; but the
whole morning of that day is con&s;umed in papering up cold chickens, bottling
brandy-punch, &s;orting clean &s;hifts, and night-caps for the children,
pinning ba&s;kets, and cord|ing trunks; as again is the whole afternoon of the
Monday following, in unpinning, uncording, locking up foul linnen, and
replacing empty bottles in the cellar. I am afraid there|fore, if the
<HI>Villas</HI> of our future trade&s;men &s;hould become &s;o very elegant,
that the &s;hop-keepers will &s;carce ever be vi&s;ible behind their counters
above once in a month.</P>

<P>_THE <HI>French</HI> have di&s;tingui&s;hed the artifices made
u&s;e of on the &s;tage to deceive the audience, by the expre&s;&s;ion of
<HI>Jeu de The&acirc;tre,</HI> which we may tran&s;late "the Juggle of the
Theatre." When the&s;e little arts are exerci&s;ed merely to a&s;&s;i&s;t
nature and &s;et her off to the be&s;t advantage, none can be &s;o critically
nice as to object to them; but when tragedy by the&s;e means is lifted into
rant, and comedy di&s;torted into buffoonery, though the deceit may &s;ucceed
with the multitude, men of &s;en&s;e will always be offended at it. This
conduct, whether of the poet or the player, re&s;embles in &s;ome &s;ort the
poor contrivance of the ancients, who mounted their heroes upon &s;tilts, and
expre&s;&s;ed the manners of their characters by the grote&s;que figures of
their ma&s;ks.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="205">AS the playhou&s;es are now opened, I
cannot better intro|duce the remarks which I may &s;ometimes take occa&s;ion to
make on the theatrical world, than by throwing together a few reflections on
this "Juggle of the Theatre;" which at pre&s;ent I &s;hall con&s;ider, only as
it relates to the actors. And I hope to merit the thanks of the&s;e gentlemen,
who while they are &s;ollicitous to acquire new beauties, &s;hould at the
&s;ame time endeavour to unlearn their faults and imperfections.</P>
<P>WE are indebted to the pre&s;ent times for a judicious
re|formation of the &s;tage in point of acting: and (by the bye) I could
wi&s;h, that the &s;ame good con&s;equences had been produced with re&s;pect to
our poets. If a perfect tragedy may be con&s;idered as the mo&s;t difficult
production of human wit, the &s;ame thing mu&s;t hold in proportion with
re&s;pect to an exact repre&s;entation of it: for if it is nece&s;&s;ary for
the writer to work up his imagination to &s;uch a pitch as to fancy him&s;elf
in the circum&s;tances of the character he draws; what le&s;s mu&s;t the actor
do, who mu&s;t look as the per&s;on repre&s;ented would look, &s;peak as he
would &s;peak, and be in every point the very man? The generation of players,
that immediately preceded the pre&s;ent, prided them&s;elves on what they
called <HI>fine &s;peaking:</HI> the emotions of the &s;oul were di&s;regarded
for a di&s;tinct delivery; and with them, as Mr. <HI>John&s;on</HI> has
ob&s;erved of &s;ome tragic writers, 
<Q> 
<L>"Declamations roar'd, while pa&s;&s;ion &s;lept."</L></Q>
And, indeed, to this &s;uperficial ta&s;te for acting we may partly attribute
that enervate way of writing &s;o much in vogue among the frenchified
play-wrights of tho&s;e times; &s;ince nothing could be &s;o well &s;uited to
the mouths of tho&s;e actors, as golden lines, round periods, florid
de&s;criptions, and a di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate amplification of &s;entiment. 
<Q><PB N="201" REF="206"> 
<L>&mdash;dedit <HI>ore rotundo</HI></L> 
<L>Mu&s;a loqui.&mdash;</L> 
<BIBL>HOR.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>THE fal&s;e maje&s;ty, with which our mimic heroes of the
&s;tage had been u&s;ed to expre&s;s them&s;elves, was for a long time as
di&s;tingui&s;hing a mark of tragedy, as the plumed hat and full-bottomed
perriwig; and we may remember for ex|ample, when every line in Othello, (a
character remarkable for variety of pa&s;&s;ions,) was drawn out in the &s;ame
pompous manner. But as I mean to promote the art, rather than reprove the
arti&s;ts, I &s;hall dwell on this no longer: for me|thinks I hear a veteran
performer calling out to me in the voice of hone&s;t <HI>Jack Fal&s;taff,</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"no more of that, if thou love&s;t me,
<HI>Hal.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>IT is &s;ufficient to remark that, as the dignity of the
bu&s;kin would be degraded by talking in a &s;train too low and fami|liar, the
manner of elocution in a tragedy &s;hould not on either hand be more remote
from our natural way of ex|pre&s;&s;ing our&s;elves, than blank ver&s;e (which
is the only proper mea&s;ure for tragedy) is from pro&s;e. Our pre&s;ent &s;et
of actors have in general di&s;carded the dead in&s;ipid pomp applauded in
their predece&s;&s;ors, and have wi&s;ely endeavoured to join with the poet in
exciting pity and terror. But as many writers have mi&s;taken rant for
pa&s;&s;ion, and fu&s;tian for &s;ublime, &s;o our players have perhaps too
much given into unnatural &s;tartings, roarings, and whinings. For this
rea&s;on our late writers (to accommodate their pieces to the pre&s;ent
ta&s;te) have placed their chief <HI>pathos</HI> in exclamations and broken
&s;entences, have endeavoured to alarm us with <HI>Ahs</HI> and <HI>Ohs,</HI>
and pierce our &s;ouls with interjections. Upon the whole, it mu&s;t be
acknowled, that the &s;tage is con&s;iderably improved in the Art of Speaking.
Every pa&s;&s;ion is now di&s;tingui&s;hed by it's proper tone of voice: I
&s;hall therefore <PB N="202" REF="207"> only add, that when I hear a player
laboriou&s;ly placing an unnatural &s;tre&s;s upon particular words, and
panting with empha&s;is, I cannot help comparing him to the paviour, who at
every thump of his rammer cries <HI>hem.</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE ob&s;erved, that the tragedians of the la&s;t age
&s;tudied <HI>fine &s;peaking</HI>; in con&s;equence of which, all their Action
con&s;i&s;ted in little more than &s;trutting with one leg before the other,
and waving one or both arms in a con|tinual &s;ee-&s;aw. Our pre&s;ent actors
have perhaps run into a contrary extreme: their ge&s;tures &s;ometimes
re&s;emble tho&s;e afflicted with <HI>St. Vitus</HI>'s Dance; their whole frame
appears to be convul&s;ed; and I have &s;een a player in the la&s;t act &s;o
mi&s;erably di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, that a deaf &s;pectator would be apt to imagine
he was complaining of the cholic and the tooth|ach. This has al&s;o given
ri&s;e to that unnatural cu&s;tom of throwing the body into various &s;trange
ATTITUDES. There is not a pa&s;&s;ion nece&s;&s;ary to be expre&s;&s;ed, but
has produced di&s;po&s;itions of the limbs not to be found in any of the
paintings or &s;culptures of the be&s;t ma&s;ters. A graceful ge&s;ture and
ea&s;y deportment is indeed worthy the care of every performer: but when I
ob&s;erve him writhing his body into more unnatural contortions than a tumbler
at <HI>Sadler's Wells,</HI> I cannot help being di&s;gu&s;ted to &s;ee him 
<Q REND="inline">"imitate humanity &s;o abominably."</Q> Our
Pantomime authors have already begun to reduce our comedies into grote&s;que
&s;cenes; and if this ta&s;te for <HI>attitude</HI> &s;hould continue to be
popular, I would recommend it to tho&s;e ingenious gentlemen to adapt our
be&s;t tragedies to the &s;ame u&s;e, and entertain us with the jealou&s;y of
<HI>Othello</HI> in dumb &s;hew, or the tricks of <HI>Harlequin
Hamlet.</HI></P>
<P>BEFORE I di&s;mi&s;s this article, it may be expected that I
&s;hould &s;ay &s;omething concerning the behaviour proper for 
<PB N="203" REF="208"> our ladies. We mu&s;t allow them on all occa&s;ions to
roll the eye, &s;tretch up the neck, heave the che&s;t, and with a thou&s;and
little tricks &s;et off their per&s;on, if not their part, to the mo&s;t
advantage. The pomp of the old &s;tage has not yet been altogether reformed,
either with re&s;pect to our heroines or our heroes. A weeping prince&s;s
(though per|haps &s;he is hurried on the &s;tage with grief and de&s;pair)
cannot decently make her entrance without being led in between two mourning
dam&s;els in black; and an heroine mu&s;t always be accompanied by one or more
pages, to &s;mooth her train when ruffled by pa&s;&s;ion. The heroe now
&s;eldom &s;weats beneath the weight of a nodding plume of &s;wan feathers, or
has his face half hid within an enormous bu&s;h of white hor&s;e hair: I could
al&s;o wi&s;h (if po&s;&s;ible) that the manager was &s;aved the
unnece&s;&s;ary expence of three yards of velvet for the trains of his Amazons,
and that the chambermaids (as well as the militia of the theatres) were
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and the pages, together with the dirty lords in waiting,
blotted out of the mute <HI>Dramatis Per&s;onae.</HI></P>
<P>THE mention of the&s;e particulars naturally reminds me to
con&s;ider how far "the Juggle of the Theatre" is concerned in the affair of
Dre&s;s. Many will agree with me, that al|mo&s;t the only di&s;tre&s;s of the
la&s;t act in the <HI>Fair Penitent</HI> ari&s;es from the pitiful appearance
of <HI>Cali&s;ta</HI> in weeds, with every thing hung in black bays about her;
and they are afraid we &s;hould lo&s;e &s;ight of <HI>Hamlet</HI>'s pretended
madne&s;s, if the black &s;tocking, di&s;covering a white one underneath, was
not rolled half-way down the leg. A propriety in dre&s;s is ab&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary to keep up the general decep|tion; and a performer properly
habited, who by his whole deportment enters deeply into the circum&s;tances of
the cha|racter he repre&s;ents, makes us for a while fancy every thing before
us real; but when, by &s;ome ill-judged piece of art, <PB N="204" REF="209"> he
departs from the &s;implicity of imitation, and 
<Q REND="inline">"over&s;teps the mode&s;ty of nature,"</Q> he
calls us back to the theatre, and excites pa&s;&s;ions very different from
tho&s;e he aims at.</P>
<P>I CANNOT better illu&s;trate what has been &s;aid on this la&s;t
&s;ubject, than by giving in&s;tances of two artifices of this kind; one of
which is employed (as I conceive) to rai&s;e pity and the other terror. When
the <HI>Romeo</HI> of <HI>Drury Lane</HI> comes to die at <HI>Juliet</HI>'s
monument we are &s;urprized to &s;ee him enter in a &s;uit of black. This I
&s;uppo&s;e is entended as a &s;troke of the pathetic: but not to dwell on the
poverty of the artifice, it is in this place a manife&s;t violation of the
poet's meaning. <HI>Romeo</HI> is &s;uppo&s;ed to come po&s;t from
Mantua&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">"get me po&s;t-hor&s;es, I will hence to
night"</Q>&mdash;&s;o that if our <HI>Ro&s;cius</HI> mu&s;t be &s;o very exact
in dre&s;&s;ing the character, he &s;hould appear at the tomb in a riding frock
and boots. But a mourning coat will excite <HI>pity,</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"and let the devil wear black, (&s;ays our
<HI>Hamlet-Romeo</HI>) for I'll have a &s;uit of &s;ables."</Q>&mdash;The
&s;ame player, after having acted that noble &s;cene in the &s;econd act of
<HI>Macbeth</HI> in &s;o fine a manner, that one would almo&s;t imagine both
the poet and player mu&s;t have murderers to repre&s;ent one &s;o well, goes
out to execute the &s;uppo&s;ed murder. After a &s;hort &s;pace he returns as
from the fact: but though the expre&s;&s;ion in his face is &s;till remarkably
excellent, one cannot but &s;mile to ob&s;erve that he has been employing
him&s;elf behind the &s;cenes in putting his wig awry, and untying one of the
tyes to it. This doubtle&s;s is de&s;igned to rai&s;e <HI>terror</HI>; but to
every di&s;cerning &s;pectator it mu&s;t appear mo&s;t ab&s;urdly ridiculous;
for who can forbear laughing, when he finds that the player would have us
imagine, that the &s;ame deed, which has thrown all that horror and confu&s;ion
into his countenance, has al&s;o un|twi&s;ted one of the tails of his
perriwig?</P>

<P>_AS I am willing to do every thing in my power to celebrate &s;o
illu&s;trious a body as the <HI>Robin Hood</HI> Society, I have taken the
fir&s;t opportunity of laying the following letter before the public.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THAT part of your la&s;t paper, in which you con|&s;idered the
Art of Speaking as far as it regards the|atrical performances, gives me
rea&s;on to hope that you will not overlook the merits of the <HI>Robin
Hood</HI> Society, where that Art is practi&s;ed in it's greate&s;t perfection.
You would do well to recommend it to the gentlemen of the theatre to attend
tho&s;e weekly meetings for their improve|ment <PB N="206" REF="211"> as often
as po&s;&s;ible; and I dare &s;ay you will join with me in giving the &s;ame
advice to the younger part of our clergy and our lawyers, as well as our
members of par|liament. The &s;tage, the pulpit, the bar, and the
&s;enate-hou&s;e cannot furni&s;h us with &s;uch glorious examples of the power
of Oratory, as are to be met with in this &s;ociety; where the mo&s;t important
que&s;tions in every branch of knowledge are di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and where the
di&s;putants are all of them equally ver&s;ed in religion, law, politics, and
the drama.</P>
<P>THE in&s;titution of this School of Eloquence far exceeds any
thing that the ancients could boa&s;t. Every &s;ect, that was known among the
<HI>Grecians</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> has it's votaries here al&s;o. I have
&s;een a taylor a <HI>Stoic,</HI> a &s;hoemaker a <HI>Pla|toni&s;t,</HI> and a
cook an <HI>Epicurean.</HI> They affect to entertain a profound veneration for
<HI>Socrates,</HI> often preferring him to any of the Apo&s;tles: but in&s;tead
of declaring with that wi&s;e philo&s;opher that they know nothing, the members
of the <HI>Robin Hood</HI> Society profe&s;s to know every thing.</P>
<P>FOR my own part, I confe&s;s my&s;elf &s;o charmed with their
proceedings, that I con&s;tantly attend them: and when I &s;ee all their
members a&s;&s;embled with each his pewter mug before him, I cannot help
preferring this &s;ocial meet|ing to any ancient <HI>Sympo&s;ium</HI> whatever;
and when I further ob&s;erve them fir&s;t take a &s;wig, and then &s;peak with
&s;uch amazing force of argument, I am apt to conclude that truth, in&s;tead of
being hid in a well (as was &s;aid by an old philo&s;opher) mu&s;t lay at the
bottom of a tankard of porter.</P>
<P>THERE is no grace or excellence in Oratory; but is
di&s;|played in the <HI>Robin Hood</HI> Society to the greate&s;t advantage.
<HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> being a&s;ked what was the fir&s;t quality in an orator,
replied&mdash;action; what the &s;econd,&mdash;action; what 
<PB N="207" REF="212"> the third,&mdash;action. Upon this principle one of the
mem|bers, for whom I have a va&s;t re&s;pect, is the greate&s;t orator that
ever lived. He never troubles him&s;elf about the order or &s;ub&s;tance of
what he delivers, but waves his hand, to&s;&s;es his head, abounds in &s;everal
new and beautiful ge&s;tures, and from the beginning of his &s;peech to the end
of it takes no care but to &s;et it off with action. <HI>Tully</HI> tells us,
that it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of an orator 
<Q REND="inline">"to prove, delight, and convince."</Q> Proof
and conviction our Society is always &s;ure to give us; for el&s;e how could it
ever come to pa&s;s, that &s;o many young men &s;hould have learned from
the&s;e di&s;qui&s;itions, that there is no God, that the &s;oul is mortal,
that religion is a je&s;t, and many other truths, which they would otherwi&s;e
never have di&s;covered. The nature of their que&s;tions is al&s;o for the
mo&s;t part &s;o entertaining, that the di&s;putes about them cannot fail of
giving delight: and there is a peculiarity in the oratory of the place, which
greatly conduces to that end. The &s;peakers do not always think them&s;elves
obliged to drive in the dull direct road to the point, but indulge them&s;elves
in a larger &s;cope that allows room for novelty and entertainment. When the
que&s;tion has been concerning the veracity of the bible, I have known a
gentleman get up, and beginning with <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror give the
audience an ab&s;tract of as many reigns, as his five minutes would allow him
to di&s;patch. I lately remember the que&s;tion to have been 
<Q REND="inline">"Whether a bridge from <HI>Black Fryars</HI>
to <HI>South|wark</HI> would be of public benefit;"</Q> when a facetious
gentleman employed him&s;elf in demon&s;trating the great utility of the bridge
of the no&s;e, and the bridge of a fid|dle. In a word, our orators are at once
&s;erious and comi|cal; and they make gravity and mirth almo&s;t con&s;tantly
at|tend each other, like their own <HI>Robin Hood</HI> and <HI>Little
John.</HI> The &s;olidity, and at the &s;ame time the &s;martne&s;s of 
<PB N="208" REF="213"> their &s;peeches, are equally remarkable. They pun with
a grave face, and make quibbles and conundrums with the air of a philo&s;opher.
The writings of different authors have been compared to wines: but the orations
delivered here can be re&s;embled to nothing &s;o properly as the liquors of
the Society; for while they are at once &s;o weighty and &s;o &s;harp, they
&s;eem to be an equal mixture of porter and lemonade.</P>
<P>IT would be endle&s;s to enumerate the advantages re&s;ulting
from this Society: The wonderful improvement it has al|ready made in our
mechanics is very evident: It calls off our trade&s;men from the
<HI>practice</HI> of hone&s;ty in their com|mon dealings, and &s;ets them upon
<HI>enquiries</HI> concerning right and wrong, and the moral fitne&s;s of
things. The SPECTATOR has told us of the rhetoric of a toyman: but you, Mr.
TOWN, might acquaint po&s;terity of the eloquence of bakers, barbers,
carpenters, and black&s;miths: you may every day hear di&s;cour&s;es on
religion from the &s;hopboard, and re&s;earches into philo&s;ophy from behind
the counter. When you took notice of the want of learning in our peo|ple of
quality, you ought in ju&s;tice to have acknowledged the amazing erudition of
our trade&s;men. The Plebeians of <HI>Rome</HI> were mere brutes to our common
people; and I am of opinion that the public room under that in which this
weekly meeting is held, in&s;tead of being furni&s;hed with the bu&s;ts of our
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> poets, &s;hould be adorned with the heads of the learned
&s;hoemakers, tallow-chandlers, ba|kers, &amp;c. that con&s;titute this
excellent Society.</P>
<P>WE may venture to &s;ay that the Royal Society and the
<HI>Robin Hood</HI> Society are the two greate&s;t ornaments of this nation:
and as the former now and then give us an account of their tran&s;actions, it
were to be wi&s;hed that the fellows <PB N="209" REF="214"> of the latter would
al&s;o from time to time oblige us with an hi&s;tory of their proceedings. We
&s;hould then &s;ee by what means &s;o many pro&s;elytes have been made from
bigotry and &s;uper&s;tition; by what degrees a young di&s;putant from a raw
Chri&s;tian ripens into a dei&s;t, from a dei&s;t into a freethinker, and from
a freethinker (by a very &s;hort &s;tep) into an athei&s;t. We &s;hould al&s;o
know the effect, that the di&s;putations at this weekly meeting has upon our
lives and conver&s;ations; and from thence judge how much a de&s;ign of this
nature de&s;erves public encouragement. I have here flung together a &s;hort
account of &s;ome of the former members, and upon a review of it cannot but
lament that it &s;eems to be the peculiar fate of great orators, &s;uch as
<HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> and <HI>Tully</HI> for example, to come to an unhappy
end.</P>

<P>_I HAVE &s;omewhere &s;een a print repre&s;enting a man and
woman of every nation in the world dre&s;t according to the mode of their
re&s;pective countries. I could not help re|flecting at the time, that the
fa&s;hions, which prevail in <HI>England</HI> in the &s;pace of a century,
would enable any of our painters to fill a picture with as great a variety of
habits; and that an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> or <HI>Engli&s;hwoman</HI> in one
part of the piece would no more re&s;emble an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> or
<HI>Engli&s;hwoman</HI> in the other, than a <HI>Frenchman</HI> does a
<HI>Chine&s;e.</HI> Very extraordinary revolutions have already hap|pened in
the habits of this kingdom; and as dre&s;s is &s;ub|ject to unaccountable
changes, po&s;terity may perhaps &s;ee without &s;urprize our ladies &s;trut
about in breeches, while our men waddle in hoop-petticoats.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="217">IN the days of queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> it
was the fa&s;hion for the ladies to conceal and wrap up as much of their bodies
as they could: their necks were encompa&s;&s;ed with a broad ruff, which
likewi&s;e &s;pread it&s;elf over their bo&s;oms; and their &s;leeves were
continued down and fa&s;tened clo&s;e to their wri&s;ts, while only their feet
were allowed ju&s;t to peep from beneath the mode&s;t fardingale; &s;o that
nothing was expo&s;ed to the impertinent eye of man but their faces. Our
mo|dern ladies have run into the direct contrary extreme, and appear like &s;o
many rope-dancers: they have di&s;carded as much of their cloaths as with any
tolerable decency can be thrown off, and may be &s;aid (like the
<HI>Indian)</HI> to be all face: the neck and bo&s;om are laid bare, and
di&s;entangled from the invidious vail of an handkerchief; the &s;tays are
&s;unk half way down the wai&s;t, and the petticoat has ri&s;en in the &s;ame
proportion from the ancle. Nor is the lover only captivated by the naked charms
which meet his &s;ight before; but our ladies, like the <HI>Parthians,</HI>
have al&s;o learned the art of wounding from behind, and attract our attention
no le&s;s by laying their &s;houlders open to the view, which (as a young
phy&s;ician of my acquaintance once ob&s;erved) makes them look as if they were
prepared to receive a bli&s;ter. A Naked Lady is no longer the admiration only
of a ma&s;que|rade: every public a&s;&s;embly will furni&s;h us with
<HI>Iphigenias</HI> undre&s;t for the &s;acrifice; and if the next &s;ummer
&s;hould prove an hot one, our ladies will perhaps improve on the thin
ve&s;ture of the <HI>Spartan</HI> virgins, and appear abroad in nothing but a
lawn &s;hade and gau&s;e petticoat. If the men &s;hould take the hint from the
other &s;ex, and begin to &s;trip in their turn, I tremble to think what may be
the con&s;e|quence: for if they go on in proportion with the women, we may
&s;oon expect to &s;ee our fine gentlemen, like the Highlanders, without
breeches.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="218">IT would be endle&s;s to trace the
&s;trange revolutions that have happened in every part of the female dre&s;s
within the&s;e few years. The hoop has been known to expand and contract
it&s;elf from the &s;ize of a butter churn to the cir|cumference of three
hog&s;heads; at one time it was &s;loped from the wai&s;t in a pyramidical
form; at another it was bent upwards like an inverted bow, by which the two
angles, when &s;queezed up on each &s;ide, came in contact with the ears. At
pre&s;ent it is nearly of an oval form, and &s;carce mea&s;ures from end to end
above twice the length of the wearer. The hoop has at pre&s;ent lo&s;t much of
its credit in the female world, and has &s;uffered much from the innova|tion of
&s;hort &s;acks and neglig&eacute;es, which it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed are
equally becoming to the lady of plea&s;ure and the lady of quality: for as the
men will agree, that next to no cloaths at all nothing is more ravi&s;hing than
an ea&s;y di&s;ha|bille, our ladies for that rea&s;on perhaps come into public
places, as if they were ju&s;t got out of bed, or as if they were ready to go
into it. This, while it is the fa&s;hion, mu&s;t be agreeable; but I mu&s;t own
that I could &s;ooner approve of their encirling them&s;elves in &s;o many ells
of whalebone, than to &s;ee them affect to appear with their cloaths huddled on
&s;o loo&s;ely and indecently. This manner of dre&s;&s;ing, or rather not
dre&s;&s;ing, was brought from <HI>Paris:</HI> but I would have my fair readers
con&s;ider, that as this loo&s;e method of dre&s;s is calculated to hide any
defects in the body, it is very impolitic to &s;uffer all that &s;ymmetry and
elegant turn of &s;hape they are mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of, to be &s;mothered under
it; &s;ince the&s;e habits can be of no more &s;ervice to their per&s;ons, than
paint (that other <HI>Paris</HI> commodity) can add to the natural red and
white of their complexion, though perhaps it may heighten the &s;allow
vi&s;ages of the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="219">BUT of all the branches of female dre&s;s
none has un|dergone more alterations than that of the head. The long lappets,
the hor&s;e-&s;hoe cap, the <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> head, and the pru|di&s;h mob
pinned under the chin, have all of them had their day. The pre&s;ent mode has
rooted out all the&s;e &s;uperfluous excre&s;cences, and in the room of a
&s;lip of cambrick or lace has planted a whim&s;ical &s;prig of &s;pangles or
artificial flow|rets. We may remember, when for a while the hair was tortured
into ringlets behind: at pre&s;ent it is braided into a <HI>que&uuml;e,</HI>
(like tho&s;e formerly worn by the men, and &s;till re|taining the original
name of <HI>Ramillies,)</HI> which, if it were not reverted upwards, would make
us imagine that our fine ladies were afflicted with the <HI>Plica
Polonica.</HI></P>
<P>IF the caps have pa&s;&s;ed through many metamorpho&s;es, no
le&s;s a change has been brought about in the other cover|ings contrived for
the head. The diminitive high-crowned hat, the bonnet, the hive, and the
milkmaid's chip hat, were re&s;cued for a time from old women and &s;ervant
girls, to adorn heads of the fir&s;t fa&s;hion: nor was the method of cocking;
hats le&s;s fluctuating, till they were at length &s;ettled to the pre&s;ent
mode; by which it is ordered that every hat, whether of &s;traw or &s;ilk,
whether of the chambermaid or the mi&s;tre&s;s, mu&s;t have their flaps turned
up perpendicu|larly both before and behind. If the end of a fine lady's dre&s;s
was not rather ornamental than u&s;eful, we &s;hould think it a little odd that
hats, which &s;eem naturally intended to &s;creen their faces from the heat or
&s;everity of the weather, &s;hould be moulded into a &s;hape that prevents
their an&s;wer|ing either of the&s;e purpo&s;es: but we mu&s;t indeed allow it
to be highly ornamental, as the pre&s;ent hats worn by the women are more bold
and impudent than the broad-brimmed &s;taring <HI>Kavenhullers</HI> worn a few
years ago by <PB N="215" REF="220"> the men. The&s;e hats are al&s;o decorated
with two waving pendants of ribband, hanging down from the brim on the left
&s;ide. I am not &s;o much offended at the flaming air which the&s;e
&s;treamers carry with them, as I am afraid le&s;t it &s;hould &s;poil the
charming eyes of my pretty country|women, which are con&s;tantly provoked to
ca&s;t a glance at them; and I have my&s;elf often ob&s;erved, an obliging ogle
or ravi&s;hing leer intercepted by the&s;e mediums, &s;o that when a lady has
intended to charm her lover, &s;he has &s;hocked him with an hideous
&s;quint.</P>
<P>THE ladies have long been &s;everely rallied on their too great
attention to finery: but to own the truth dre&s;s &s;eems at pre&s;ent to be as
much the &s;tudy of the male part of the world as the female. We have
gentlemen, who 
<Q REND="inline">"will lay a whole night (as <HI>Benedick</HI>
&s;ays) carving the fa&s;hion of a new doublet:"</Q> they have their toilettes
too, as well as the ladies, &s;et out with wa&s;hes, perfumes and co&s;metics,
and will &s;pend the whole morning in dre&s;&s;ing their hair, &s;centing their
linnen, and arching their eyebrows. Their heads (as well as the ladies) have
undergone various muta|tions, and have worn as many different kinds of wigs, as
the block at their barbers. About fifty years ago they buried their heads in a
bu&s;h of hair; and the beaux (as <HI>Swift</HI> &s;ays) lay hid beneath the
penthou&s;e of a full-bottomed perriwig. But as they then &s;hewed nothing but
the no&s;e, mouth and eyes, the fine gentlemen of our time not only oblige us
with their full faces, but have drawn back the &s;ide curls quite to the tip of
the ear.</P>
<P>AS <HI>France</HI> appears to be the wardrobe of the world, I
&s;hall conclude my paper with a piece of &s;ecret hi&s;tory, which gives us
&s;ome in&s;ight into the origin of deriving all our fa&s;hions from
thence.&mdash;The celebrated Lord <HI>Foppington</HI> among his other amours
had once an intrigue with a milliner <PB N="216" REF="221"> of
<HI>Covent-Garden,</HI> who after &s;ome time brought a lovely girl into the
world, and called her after his lord&s;hip's &s;ir|name, FASHION. The milliner
brought up the child in her own hou&s;e till the age of fifteen, at which time
&s;he grew very pre&s;&s;ing with Lord <HI>Foppington</HI> to make &s;ome
provi&s;ion for his daughter. My lord, who was never much plea&s;ed with this
con&s;equence of his amours, that he might be rid of the girl for ever, put her
into the hands of a friend, who was going abroad, to place her in a nunnery:
but the girl, who had very little of the ve&s;tal in her di&s;po&s;ition,
contrived to e&s;cape from her conductor, and fly to <HI>Paris.</HI> There her
beauty and &s;prightline&s;s &s;oon &s;ecured her many friends; and &s;he
opened a genteel &s;hop in her mother's bu&s;ine&s;s. She &s;oon made her&s;elf
remarkable for contriving the mo&s;t ele|gant head-dre&s;&s;es, and cutting out
ruffles with the mo&s;t ra|vi&s;hing &s;lope: her fancy was be&s;ides &s;o
inexhau&s;tible, that &s;he almo&s;t every day produced a great variety of new
and beautiful patterns. She had many adorers, and at la&s;t mar|ried his Mo&s;t
Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty's taylor. This alliance brought the dre&s;s of all
<HI>Paris</HI> under their juri&s;diction; and the young lady, out of a natural
love to her native country, propo&s;ed the extending their care to the fine

<P>_A CORRESPONDENT writes to me, that after having con&s;idered
the Art of Speaking in the Theatre, as al&s;o celebrated the practice of it in
the <HI>Robin Hood</HI> Society, my remarks will not be compleat, except I take
notice of the extraordinary eloquence of the <HI>Clare-Market</HI> Orator. He
de&s;ires me to remember, that this Univer&s;al Genius has from time to time
declared from his Ro&s;trum with a thundering elocution,&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">"that there is but one Orator in the world, and
He is the man&mdash;that Sir <HI>Robert Wal|pole</HI> and all the great men in
the kingdom, have been His &s;cholars&mdash;and that Bi&s;hops have come to His
Oratory to learn to preach."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="223">I HAVE indeed ob&s;erved with a good deal
of concern, that the Orator has of late di&s;continued to oblige the public
with his &s;unday evening lectures as u&s;ual. In&s;tead of &s;eeing his
Oratory-Chapel &s;hut up, I was in hopes that every pari&s;h church in the
kingdom would be opened on the &s;ame prin|ciples. How much more &s;alutary
were His tenets, &s;etting forth the &s;ufficiency of Rea&s;on, than the cold
doctrine of our clergy preaching up the nece&s;&s;ity of Faith! how &s;uperior
was his form of prayer to our whole liturgy, and how much better adapted to
particular occa&s;ions!&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">"A prayer for a &s;inking bridge!&mdash;prayer
for the White Ro&s;e!&mdash; prayer for <HI>Jack&s;on</HI>'s
Journal!&mdash;prayer for the heads on <HI>Temple-Bar!</HI>"</Q>&mdash;In
the&s;e pious addre&s;&s;es he would fir&s;t invoke the Supreme Being in the
mo&s;t &s;olemn manner; then &s;uddenly &s;lide into the familiar, and
pray,&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">"that we might not hear the croaking of
<HI>Dutch Nightingales</HI> in the king's chambers;"</Q>&mdash;or on another
occa&s;ion, 
<Q REND="inline">"that our clergy might not &s;tudy
<HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> more than the Go&s;pel, and that they might be rather
employed on the Evange|li&s;ts, than <HI>As you like it,</HI> or <HI>Much ado
about nothing.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>I CANNOT but likewi&s;e lament the lo&s;s of the entertain|ment,
which his Adverti&s;ements u&s;ed to give us every Sa|turday in the
news-papers. The terms in which they were commonly expre&s;&s;ed were clear and
elegant, and furni&s;hed the reader with an admirable idea of the Doctor's
manner from the pulpit. For in&s;tance, when he told you his text was from
<HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> and quoted the&s;e words&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Strt!</HI> 10 <HI>Jun! No Hnvr! Down with
the Rmp!</HI>"</Q>&mdash;we might form a tolerable judgement of the great
reverence he paid the Bible; and when he called his A&s;&s;embly&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>The</HI> ORATORY&mdash;P. <HI>Charles's
Chapel</HI>"</Q>&mdash;we might gue&s;s at his loyalty and patrioti&s;m.
The&s;e were the advantages, which we derived <PB N="219" REF="224"> from his
Chapel; and if the Oratory remains &s;hut, I &s;hall begin to fear that things
will continue in their pre&s;ent &s;hocking &s;tate; and that the Scheme lately
propo&s;ed in one of my papers <HI>for aboli&s;hing Chri&s;tianity</HI> will
not take effect; at which I am more particularly concerned, as it will hinder
the advancement of this great man. For if &s;uch a revolution &s;hould happen
in the church, the Ora|tor's principles would be found &s;o entirely
fundamental, that he would probably then hold &s;ome honourable &s;tation equal
to our pre&s;ent Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury.</HI></P>
<P>THE public for the&s;e rea&s;ons will doubtle&s;s join with me
in a petition, that this illu&s;trious Divine would again re&s;ume his
&s;tation in the pulpit: at lea&s;t I could wi&s;h, that &s;ome able
Theologi&s;t, who has been long practi&s;ed in de|ciding on the mo&s;t
ab&s;tru&s;e points of religion in the <HI>Robin Hood</HI> Society, may be
deputed in the ab&s;ence of the Orator to officiate as his curate. I would
al&s;o re|commend it to the above-mentioned Society to attend the&s;e lectures
regularly; from, whence they may gather &s;tronger arguments for their
di&s;putations, than from reading <HI>Collins, Chubb, Tindal, Bolingbroke,</HI>
or any other orthodox free|thinker whatever. Upon the whole I cannot conclude
without ob&s;erving, that &s;uch is the ingratitude of the age, that the
&s;ingular merits of our Orator are not &s;ufficiently regarded. He is indeed
de&s;ervedly care&s;&s;ed by the Butchers of <HI>Clare-Market:</HI> but had our
Orator been born at <HI>Athens</HI> or <HI>Rome,</HI> he would certainly have
been deified as the God of Butchers, have been wor&s;hipped like
<HI>I&s;is</HI> under the figure of a Calf, or have had a &s;tatue erected to
him in the <HI>Fo|rum</HI> or <HI>Market</HI>-place among the Shambles.</P>
<P>THUS much I thought my&s;elf bound to &s;ay in prai&s;e of the
Orator and Oratory; as he has &s;ome time ago done <PB N="220" REF="225"> me
the honour of a letter, which I am very glad of this opportunity to communicate
to my readers. The private epi&s;tles of <HI>Tully</HI> are very unequal to his
Orations: but the following letter is in the very &s;tile and &s;pirit of our
Ora|tor's animated di&s;cour&s;es from the pulpit. I &s;hall there|fore
pre&s;ent it to the public exactly as I received it, with|out pre&s;uming to
alter or &s;uppre&s;s the lea&s;t &s;yllable: and for the further

<P>I WOULD have you to know, that the per&s;on as &s;ent you the
account of our Club did not do right. He repre|&s;ents us all as a pack of
trade&s;men and mechanics, and would have you to think as how there are no
gentlemen among us. But that is not the ca&s;e: I am a gentleman, and we have a
great many topping people be&s;ides. Though Mr. Pre&s;ident is but a baker, and
we have a &s;hoemaker, and &s;ome other handicraft&s;men, that come to talk;
yet I can a&s;&s;ure you they know as much of religion and the good of their
country, (and other &s;uch matters,) as any of we gentle|men. But as I &s;aid
we have a good many topping folks be&s;ides my&s;elf: for there is not a night
but we have &s;everal young lawyers and councellors, and doctors, and
&s;urgeons, and captains, and poets, and players, and a great many Iri&s;h|men
and Scotchmen (very fine &s;peakers) who follow no bu&s;i|ne&s;s; be&s;ides
&s;everal foreigners, who are all of them great men in their own country. And
we have one &s;quire, who lives at t'other end of the town, and always comes in
his chariot.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="227">AND &s;o as I &s;aid we have a good many
tip-top people, as can talk as well as any of your play-folks or par&s;ons: and
as for my part every body knows that I am a lord's gentleman, and never was the
man that wore a livery in my life. I have been of the Club more or le&s;s off
and on for the&s;e &s;ix years, and never let a que&s;tion pa&s;s me, Mr.
Pre&s;ident knows it: and though I &s;ay it that &s;hould not &s;ay it, I can
talk (and &s;o can any of our Club) as well as the be&s;t of you poets can

<P>_AT a certain coffee-hou&s;e near the <HI>Temple</HI> the bar is
kept by a pretty coquet, a piece of furniture almo&s;t as nece&s;&s;ary for a
coffee-room in that &s;ituation as the news papers. This lady, you may be
&s;ure, has many admirers, who are now and then glad of an opportunity to
relieve them&s;elves from the &s;evere &s;tudy of the law by a &s;oft
conver&s;ation with this fair one, and repeating on the occa&s;ion all the
tender things they can remember from plays, or whatever el&s;e <HI>Orgeat</HI>
or <HI>Cappillaire</HI> can in&s;pire. Among the many pretenders to her favour
there is one faithful &s;wain, who has long entertained a &s;erious pa&s;&s;ion
for her. This tender-hearted gentleman, who is grown &s;o lean with living upon
love, that one would imagine 
<Q REND="inline">"the bla&s;ts of <HI>January</HI> 
<PB N="224" REF="229"> would blow him through and through,"</Q> comes every
evening, and &s;its whole hours by the bar, gazing at his mi&s;tre&s;s, and
taking in large draughts of love and Hy&s;on tea. Never was &s;wain in &s;uch
cruel circum&s;tances. He is forced to bear with patience all the haughty
in&s;olence of this godde&s;s of bread and butter; who, as &s;he knows him in
her power, keeps him at a di&s;tance, though &s;he behaves with the perte&s;t
familiarity to the other coxcombs, who are continually buzzing about her. At
eleven he &s;neaks off pale and di&s;contented; but cannot forbear coming again
the next evening, though he knows how vilely he &s;hall be u&s;ed by his
mi&s;tre&s;s, and that he is laughed at even by the waiters.</P>
<P>IF all true lovers were obliged, like this unhappy gen|tleman,
to carry on their court&s;hips in public, we &s;hould be witne&s;s to many
&s;cenes equally ridiculous. Their aukward de&s;ire of plea&s;ing influences
every trivial ge&s;ture, and when once love has got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a
man's heart, it &s;hews it&s;elf down to the tips of his fingers. The
conver&s;ation of a lan|gui&s;hing <HI>inamorato</HI> is made up chiefly of
dumb &s;igns, &s;uch as &s;ighs, ogles, or glances: but if he offers to break
his pa&s;&s;ion to his mi&s;tre&s;s, there is &s;uch a &s;tammering, faultering
and half-wording the matter, that the language of love, &s;o much talked of by
poets, is in truth no language at all. Whoever &s;hould break in upon a
gentleman and lady, while &s;o critical a conver&s;ation is going forward,
would not forbear laughing at &s;uch an extraordinary <HI>t&eacute;te &aacute;
t&eacute;te,</HI> and would perhaps cry out with <HI>Ranger,</HI> that 
<Q REND="inline">"nothing looks &s;o &s;illy as a pair of your
true lovers."</Q></P>
<P>SINCE true and &s;incere love is &s;ure to make it's votaries
thus ridiculous, we cannot &s;ufficiently commend our pre|&s;ent people of
quality, who have made &s;uch laudable at|tempts to deliver them&s;elves and
po&s;terity from its bondage. <PB N="225" REF="230"> In a fa&s;hionable wedding
the man or woman are neither of them con&s;idered as rea&s;onable creatures,
who come together in order to 
<Q REND="inline">"comfort, love, cheri&s;h, honour or obey,"</Q>
according to their re&s;pective duties, but are regarded merely as
in&s;truments of joining one e&s;tate to another. Acre marries acre; and to
increa&s;e and multiply their fortunes is in genteel matches the chief
con&s;ideration of man and wife. The court&s;hip is carried on by the council
of each party, and they pay their addre&s;&s;es by billet-deux upon parchment.
The great convenience of expelling love from matrimony is very evident: Married
per&s;ons of quality are never troubled with each others company abroad, or
fatigued with dull matrimonial di&s;cour&s;es at home: My lord keeps his girl,
my lady has her gallant; and they both enjoy all the fa&s;hionable privileges
of wed|lock without the inconveniences. This would never be the ca&s;e, if
there was the lea&s;t &s;park of love &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between them, but they
mu&s;t be reduced to the &s;ame &s;ituation with tho&s;e wretches, who (as they
have nothing to &s;ettle on each other but them&s;elves) are obliged to make up
the deficiencies of fortune by affection. But while the&s;e mi&s;erable, fond,
doating, unfa&s;hionable cou|ples are obliged to content them&s;elves with love
and a cottage, people of quality enjoy the comforts of indiffe|rence and a
coach and &s;ix.</P>
<P>THE late Marriage Act is excellently adapted to pro|mote this
prudential proceeding with re&s;pect to wedlock. It will in time inevitably
aboli&s;h the old &s;y&s;tem of found|ing matrimony on affection; and marrying
for love will be given up for the &s;ake of marrying according to Act of
Parliament. There is now no danger of an hand&s;ome worthy young fellow of
&s;mall fortune running away with an heire&s;s; for it is not &s;ufficient to
in&s;inuate him&s;elf into <PB N="226" REF="231"> the lady's favour by a
voluble tongue and a good per|&s;on, unle&s;s he can al&s;o &s;ubdue the
con&s;iderate parents or guardians by the merits of his rent-roll. As this Act
promotes the method of di&s;po&s;ing of children by way of bargain and &s;ale,
it con&s;equently puts an end to that ridiculous court&s;hip, ari&s;ing from
&s;imple love. In order therefore to confirm (as far as po&s;&s;ible) the happy
con|&s;equences of this act, I have been long endeavouring to hit on &s;ome
expedient, by which all the circum&s;tances preparatory to wedlock may be
carried on in a proper manner. A <HI>Smithfield</HI> bargain being &s;o common
in me|taphor, I had once &s;ome thoughts of propo&s;ing to realize it, and had
almo&s;t completed a plan, by which all the young per&s;ons (like &s;ervant
girls at a &s;tatute-fair in the country) were to be brought to market, and
di&s;po&s;ed of in one part of <HI>Smithfield,</HI> while the &s;heep and
hor&s;es were on &s;ale in another.</P>
<P>IN the mid&s;t of the&s;e &s;erious con&s;iderations I received
a &s;cheme of this nature from my good friend Mr. KEITH, who&s;e chapel the
late Marriage Act has rendered u&s;ele&s;s on its original principles. This
reverend gentleman, &s;ee|ing that all hu&s;bands and wives are henceforward to
be put up to &s;ale, propo&s;es &s;hortly to open his chapel on a more new and
fa&s;hionable plan. As the ingenious Me&s;&s;ieurs <HI>Hen&s;on</HI> and
<HI>Bever</HI> have lately opened in different quarters of the town
Repo&s;itories for all hor&s;es to be &s;old by auction; Mr. KEITH intends
&s;etting up a Repo&s;itory for all young males and females to be di&s;po&s;ed
of in marriage. From the&s;e &s;tuds (as the Doctor him&s;elf expre&s;&s;es it)
a lady of beauty may be coupled to a man of fortune, and an old gentleman, who
has a colt's tooth remaining, may match him&s;elf with a tight young filly.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="232">THE Doctor makes no doubt but his Chapel
will turn out even more to his advantage on this new plan than on it's fir&s;t
in&s;titution, provided he can &s;ecure his &s;cheme to him|&s;elf, and reap
the benefits of it without interlopers from the <HI>Fleet.</HI> To prevent his
de&s;ign being pirated, he intends peti|tioning the Parliament, that as he has
been &s;o great a &s;ufferer by the Marriage Act, the &s;ole right of opening a
Repo&s;itory of this &s;ort may be ve&s;ted in him, and that his place of
re&s;i|dence in May Fair may &s;till continue the grand mart for marriages. Of
the fir&s;t day of &s;ale proper notice will be given in the public papers, and
in the mean time I am de&s;ired to communicate the following &s;pecimen to my
readers.</P>

<P>_AS I was pa&s;&s;ing the other night through a narrow little
lane in the &s;kirts of the city, I was &s;topped by a grand proce&s;&s;ion of
a hear&s;e and three mourning-coaches drawn by &s;ix hor&s;es, accompanied with
a great number of flambeaus and attendants in black. I naturally concluded,
that all this parade was em|ployed to pay the la&s;t honours to &s;ome eminent
per&s;on, who&s;e con&s;equence in life required that his a&s;hes &s;hould
re|ceive all the re&s;pect which his friends and relations could pay to them:
but I could not help &s;miling, when upon en|quiry I was told, that the
corp&s;e (on whom all this expence had been lavi&s;hed) was no other than
<HI>Tom Ta&s;ter</HI> the chee&s;emonger, who had lain in &s;tate all the week
at his <PB N="230" REF="235"> hou&s;e in <HI>Thames-&s;treet,</HI> and was
going to be depo&s;ited with his ance&s;tors in <HI>White-chapel</HI>
burying-ground. This illu&s;trious per&s;onage was, I believe, the fir&s;t of
his family, that ever thought of riding in a coach, living or dead: he was the
&s;on of a butcher in <HI>White-chapel,</HI> and died indeed but in
in|different circum&s;tances: his widow however, for the ho|nour of
<HI>her</HI> family, was re&s;olved at all events to <HI>bury him
hand&s;omely.</HI></P>
<P>YOU have already, Mr. <HI>TOWN,</HI> taken notice of that
ridiculous affectation among the middling &s;ort of people, which induces them
to make a figure beyond their circum|&s;tances: I could wi&s;h that you would
al&s;o expo&s;e this equally ab&s;urd vanity, which extends to the du&s;t, and
by which the dead are made acce&s;&s;ory in robbing the living. I have
fre|quently known a greater &s;um expended at the funeral of a trade&s;man,
than would have kept his whole family for a twelvemonth; and it has more than
once happened, that the next heir has been flung into gaol for not being able
to pay the undertaker's bill.</P>
<P>THIS ab&s;urd notion of being <HI>hand&s;omely buried</HI> has
given ri&s;e to the mo&s;t contradictory cu&s;toms, that could po&s;&s;ibly be
contrived for the advantage of death-hunters. As funerals are at pre&s;ent
conducted, all di&s;tinction is lo&s;t among us; and there is no more
difference between the duke and the dancing-ma&s;ter in the manner of their
burial, than is to be found between their du&s;t in the grave. It is ea&s;y to
account for the introduction of the hear&s;e and mourning-coach in our funeral
ceremonies, though their propriety is entirely de&s;troyed by the promi&s;cuous
u&s;e of them. Our ancient and noble families may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have
particular family-vaults near their man&s;ion-hou&s;es in the country, and in
which their progenitors have been depo&s;ited for ages. It is therefore very
natural that per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, who had been u&s;ed to be conveyed to
their country-&s;eats by a &s;et of hor&s;es, &s;hould be al&s;o tran&s;ported
to their graves by the &s;ame number; and be attended with the &s;ame
magnificence at their deaths, which they had been accu&s;tomed to in their
lives. The &s;pirit of affecting the manners of the great has 
<PB N="231" REF="236"> from hence made others vie (as far as they can) with
people of quality in the pomp of their burials: a trade&s;man, who has trudged
on foot all his life, &s;hall be carried after death, &s;carce an hundred yards
from his hou&s;e, with the equipage and retinue of a lord; and the plodding
cit, who&s;e ambition never &s;oared beyond the occa&s;ional one-hor&s;e-chair,
mu&s;t be dragged to his long home by &s;ix hor&s;es. Such an ill-timed
o&s;tentation of grandeur appears to me no le&s;s ridiculous than the vanity of
the highwayman, who &s;old his body to the &s;urgeons, that he might hire a
mourning-coach, and go to the gallows like a gentleman.</P>
<P>THERE is another cu&s;tom, which was doubtle&s;s fir&s;t
in|troduced by the great, but has been &s;ince adopted by others, who have not
the lea&s;t title to it. The herald's office was originally in&s;tituted for
the di&s;tinction and pre&s;ervation of gentility; and nobody is allowed to
bear a coat of arms, but what belongs to the family, and who is intitled to
that honourable badge. From this con&s;ideration we may account for the
practice of hanging the hear&s;e round with e&s;cutcheons, on which the arms of
the decea&s;ed were blazoned, and which &s;erved to denote who&s;e a&s;hes it
conveyed. For the &s;ame purpo&s;e an atchievement was afterwards fixed over
the door of the late habitation of the decea&s;ed. This en&s;ign of death may
fairly be indulged, where the per&s;ons are enno|bled by their birth or
&s;tation, and where it &s;erves to remind the pa&s;&s;er-by of any great or
good actions performed by the decea&s;ed, or to in&s;pire the living with an
emulation of their virtues. But why, for&s;ooth, cannot an ob&s;cure or
in&s;igni|ficant creature go out of the world, without adverti&s;ing it by the
atchievement? For my part, I generally con&s;ider it as a bill on an empty
hou&s;e, which &s;erves the widow to in|form you, that the former tenant is
gone, and that another occupier is wanted in his room. Many families have
indeed been very much perplexed in making out their right to this mark of
gentility, and great profit has ari&s;en to the herald's office by the
purcha&s;e of arms for this purpo&s;e. Many a worthy trade&s;man of
<HI>plebeian</HI> extraction has been made a gentleman after his decea&s;e by
the courte&s;y of his under|taker; and I once knew a keeper of a tavern, who
not <PB N="232" REF="237"> being able to give any account of his wife's
genealogy, put up his &s;ign, the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Arms,</HI> for an
atchievement at her death.</P>
<P>IT was the cu&s;tom, in the time of the plague, to fix a mark
on tho&s;e hou&s;es, in which any one had died. This probably may have given
ri&s;e to the general fa&s;hion of hang|ing up an atchievement. However this
be, it is now de|&s;igned as a polite token, that a death has happened in the
family, and might rea&s;onably be under&s;tood as a warning to keep people from
intruding on their grief. No &s;uch thing is, indeed, intended by it: I am
therefore of opinion, that it ought every-where to be taken down after the
fir&s;t week. Whatever outward &s;igns of mourning may be pre&s;erved, no
regard is ever paid to them within: the &s;ame vi&s;itings, the &s;ame
card-playings, are carried on as before; and &s;o little re&s;pect is &s;hewn
to the atchievement, that if it happens (as it often does) to inter&s;ect one
of the windows in the grand apartment, it is occa&s;ionally re|moved, whenever
the lady dowager has a route or drum-major.</P>
<P>THIS naturally leads me to con&s;ider how much 
<Q REND="inline">"the cu&s;tomary &s;uits of &s;olemn
black,"</Q> and the other 
<Q REND="inline">"trap|pings and &s;igns of woe,"</Q> are
become a mere farce and matter of form only. When a per&s;on of di&s;tinction
goes out of the world, not only the relations, but the whole hou&s;ehold,
mu&s;t be cloathed in &s;able. The kitchen-wench &s;cours her di&s;hes in
crape, and the helper in the &s;tables rubs down his hor&s;es in black-leather
breeches. Every thing mu&s;t put on a di&s;mal appearance: even the coach
mu&s;t be covered and lined with black. This la&s;t particular, it is
rea&s;onable to imagine, is intended (like a death's head on the toilet) to put
the owner con&s;tantly in mind, that the pomp of the world and all gay
pur&s;uits are but vain and peri&s;hable. Yet what is more common than for
the&s;e di&s;mal vehicles to wait at the doors of the theatres, the
opera-hou&s;e, and other public places of diver&s;ion? Tho&s;e who are carried
in them are as little affected by their di&s;mal appearance as the hor&s;es
that draw them; and I once &s;aw <PB N="233" REF="238"> with great &s;urprize
an harlequin, a &s;caramouch, a &s;hep|herde&s;s, and a black &s;attin devil,
get into a mourning coach to go to a jubilee ma&s;querade.</P>
<P>IF I &s;hould not be thought to lay too much &s;tre&s;s on the
le&s;&s;er formalities ob&s;erved in mourning, I might mention the admirable
method of qualifying the melancholy hue of the mourning ring, by enlivening it
with the brilliancy of a diamond. I knew a young lady, who wore on the &s;ame
finger a ring &s;et round with death's heads and cro&s;s marrow bones for the
lo&s;s of her father, and another prettily em|belli&s;hed with burning hearts
pierced through with darts, in re&s;pect to her lover. But what I mo&s;t of all
admire is the odd contrivance, by which per&s;ons &s;pread the tidings of the
death of their relations to the mo&s;t di&s;tant parts, by the means of
black-edged paper and black &s;ealing wax. If it were po&s;&s;ible to in&s;pect
the &s;everal letters that bear about them the&s;e external tokens of grief, I
believe we &s;hould hardly ever find the contents of the &s;ame gloomy
complexion: a lu&s;cious &s;onnet, or an amorous <HI>billet-doux,</HI> would be
much oftener found to be conveyed under the&s;e di&s;mal pa&s;sports, than
doleful ditties or reflections on mor|tality: and indeed the&s;e mock &s;igns
of woe are &s;o little attended to, that a per&s;on opens one of the&s;e
letters with no more concern than is felt by the po&s;tman who brings it. Here
I mu&s;t not forget mentioning the excellent fancy of a friend of mine, who has
greatly improved this ar|ticle: ever &s;ince the death of his wife he has made
u&s;e of black &s;and, and writes with nothing but a crow-quill pen.</P>
<P>WE cannot &s;uppo&s;e that black-edged paper was ever intended
to be defiled by vulgar hands, but contrived (like gilt paper) for the u&s;e of
the polite world only. But alas! we mu&s;t always be aping the manners of our
betters! My agent &s;ends me letters about bu&s;ine&s;s upon gilt paper; and a
&s;tationer near the <HI>'Change</HI> tells me, that he not only &s;ells a
great quantity of mourning paper to the citizens, but that he has lately
blacked the edges of <PB N="234" REF="239"> the &s;hop-books for &s;everal
trade&s;men. You mu&s;t have &s;een, Mr. <HI>TOWN,</HI> an elegant kind of
paper, imported from <HI>France</HI> for the u&s;e of our fine ladies and
gentlemen. An acquaintance of mine has contrived a new &s;ort of mourning paper
on the &s;ame plan: and as the margin of the other is prettily adorned with
flowers, true lovers knots, little cupids, and amorous po&s;ies, in red ink; he
intends that the margin of his paper &s;hall be di&s;mally &s;tamped in black
ink with the figures of tomb-&s;tones, hour-gla&s;&s;es, bones, &s;kulls, and
other emblems of death, to be u&s;ed by per&s;ons of quality, when in
mourning.</P>

<P>_THERE needs no apology to my readers for making the following
letter the enter|tainment of to-day: I &s;hall therefore only a&s;&s;ure the
ingenious corre&s;pondent that fa|voured me with it, that if it had not been
accidentally mi&s;laid, it would not have remained &s;o long unnoticed.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR frequent ridicule of the &s;everal branches of Gaming has
given me great plea&s;ure: I could only wi&s;h that you had completed the
de&s;ign by drawing at large the portrait of a Game&s;ter. This, &s;ince you
omitted it, I have ventured to undertake; and while your papers on this 
<PB N="236" REF="241"> &s;ubject &s;erve as a counter-treati&s;e to that of
<HI>Hoyle</HI> on Whi&s;t, Back-gammon, &amp;c. my rough draught of the
profe&s;&s;ors of the&s;e arts may tend to illu&s;trate the work, and &s;tand
as pro|perly in the fronti&s;piece as the Knave of Clubs at the door of a
cardmaker.</P>
<P>THE whole tribe of Game&s;ters may be ranked under two
divi&s;ions: every man who makes carding, dicing, and bet|ting his daily
practice is either a Dupe or a Sharper, two characters equally the objects of
envy and admiration. The Dupe is generally a per&s;on of great fortune and weak
intellects, 
<Q> 
<L>"Who will as tenderly be led by th' no&s;e</L> 
<L>"As a&s;&s;es are."</L> 
<BIBL>SHAKESPEAR.</BIBL></Q> He plays, not that he has any
delight in cards or dice, but becau&s;e it is the fa&s;hion; and if whi&s;t or
hazard are propo&s;ed, he will no more refu&s;e to make one at the table, than
among a &s;et of hard drinkers he would object drinking his gla&s;s in turn,
becau&s;e he is not dry.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;ome few in&s;tances of men of &s;en&s;e, as well
as family and fortune, who have been dupes and bubbles. Such an unaccountable
itch of play has &s;eized them that they have &s;acrificed every thing to it,
and have &s;eemed wed|ded to &s;even's the main, and the odd trick. There is
not a more melancholy object than a gentleman of &s;en&s;e thus infatuated. He
makes him&s;elf and family a prey to a gang of villains more infamous than
highwaymen; and perhaps when his ruin is completed, he is glad to join with the
very &s;coundrels that de&s;troyed him, and live upon the &s;poils of others,
whom he can draw into the &s;ame follies that proved &s;o fatal to
him&s;elf.</P>
<P>HERE we may take a &s;urvey of the character of a Shar|per,
and that he may have no room to complain of foul <PB N="237" REF="242"> play,
let us begin with his excellencies. You will perhaps be &s;tartled, Mr. TOWN,
when I mention the excellencies of a Sharper; but a Game&s;ter who makes a
decent figure in the world, mu&s;t be endued with many amiable qualities, which
would undoubtedly appear with great lu&s;tre, were they not eclip&s;ed by the
odious character affixed to his trade. In order to carry on the common
bu&s;ine&s;s of his profe&s;&s;ion, he mu&s;t be a man of quick and lively
parts, at|tended with a Stoical calmne&s;s of temper, and a con&s;tant
pre&s;ence of mind. He mu&s;t &s;mile at the lo&s;s of thou&s;ands, and is not
to be di&s;compo&s;ed, though ruin &s;tares him in the face. As he is to live
among the great, he mu&s;t not want politene&s;s and affability; he mu&s;t be
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, but not &s;ervile; he mu&s;t be ma&s;ter of an ingenuous
liberal air, and have a &s;eeming openne&s;s of behaviour.</P>
<P>THESE mu&s;t be the chief accompli&s;hments of our Hero: but
le&s;t I &s;hould be accu&s;ed of giving too favourable a like|ne&s;s of him,
now we have &s;een his out&s;ide, let us take a view of his heart. There we
&s;hall find avarice the main &s;pring that moves the whole machine. Every
Game&s;ter is eaten up with avarice, and when this pa&s;&s;ion is in full
force, it is more &s;trongly predominant than any other. It conquers even
lu&s;t; and conquers it more effectually than age. At &s;ixty we look at a fine
woman with plea&s;ure: but when cards and dice have engro&s;&s;ed our
attention, women and all their charms are &s;lighted at five and twenty. A
thorough Game&s;ter renounces <HI>Venus</HI> and <HI>Cupid</HI> for
<HI>Plutus</HI> and Ams|ace, and owns no mi&s;tre&s;s of his heart except the
Queen of Trumps. His in&s;atiable avarice can only be gratified by hypocri&s;y;
&s;o that all tho&s;e &s;pecious virtues already men|tioned, and which, if
real, might be turned to the benefit of mankind, mu&s;t be directed in a
Game&s;ter towards the de&s;truction of his fellow-creatures. His quick and
lively <PB N="238" REF="243"> parts are only to in&s;truct and a&s;&s;i&s;t him
in the mo&s;t dextrous method of packing the cards and cogging the dice: his
for|titude, which enables him to lo&s;e thou&s;ands without emotion, mu&s;t
often be practi&s;ed again&s;t the &s;tings and reproaches of his own
con&s;cience; and his liberal deportment and affected openne&s;s is only to
recommend and conceal the blacke&s;t villainy.</P>
<P>IT is now nece&s;&s;ary to take a &s;econd &s;urvey of his
heart, and as we have &s;een it's vices let us con&s;ider it's mi&s;eries. The
covetous man who has not &s;ufficient cou|rage or inclination to encrea&s;e his
fortune by bets, cards, or dice, but is contented to hoard up his thou&s;ands
by thefts le&s;s public, or by cheats le&s;s liable to uncertainty, lives in a
&s;tate of perpetual &s;u&s;picion and terror; but the avaritious fears of the
Game&s;ter, are infinitely greater. He is con&s;tantly to wear a ma&s;k, and
like <HI>Mon&s;ieur St. Croix,</HI> coadjutor to that famous
<HI>empoi&s;onneu&s;e Madame Brinvillier,</HI> if his ma&s;k falls off, he runs
the hazard of being &s;uffocated by the &s;tench of his own poi&s;ons. I have
&s;een &s;ome ex|amples of this &s;ort, not many years ago at <HI>White</HI>'s.
I am uncertain whether the wretches are &s;till alive, but if they are, they
breath like toads under ground, crawling amid&s;t old walls, and paths long
&s;ince unfrequented.</P>
<P>BUT &s;uppo&s;ing that the Sharper's hypocri&s;y remains
undetected, in what a &s;tate of mind mu&s;t that man be who&s;e fortune
depends upon the in&s;incerity of his heart, the di&s;ingenuity of his
behaviour, and the fal&s;e bia&s;s of his dice? What &s;en&s;ations mu&s;t he
&s;uppre&s;s when he is obliged to &s;mile, although he is provoked: when he
mu&s;t look &s;erene in the height of de&s;pair, and when he mu&s;t act the
Stoic, without the con&s;olation of one virtuous &s;entiment, or one moral
principle? How unhappy mu&s;t he be even in <PB N="239" REF="244"> that
&s;ituation, from which he hopes to reap mo&s;t benefit? I mean, amid&s;t
&s;tars, garters, and the various herds of no|bility? Their lord&s;hips are not
always in an humour for play: they chu&s;e to laugh; they chu&s;e to joke; in
the mean while our hero mu&s;t patiently await the good hour, and mu&s;t not
only join in the laugh, and applaud the jokes, but mu&s;t humour every turn and
caprice, to which that &s;et of &s;poiled children called bucks of quality are
liable. Surely his brother <HI>Thicket</HI>'s employment of &s;auntring on
hor&s;eback in the wind and rain till the <HI>Reading</HI> coach pa&s;&s;es
through <HI>Smallberry-Green,</HI> is the more eligible, and no le&s;s
hone&s;t, occupation.</P>
<P>THE Sharper has al&s;o frequently the mortification of being
thwarted in his de&s;igns. Opportunities of fraud will not for ever pre&s;ent
them&s;elves. The fal&s;e die cannot be con&s;tantly produced, nor the packed
cards perpetually be placed upon the table. It is then our game&s;ter is in the
greate&s;t danger. But even then when he is in the power of fortune, and has
nothing but meer luck and fair play on his &s;ide, he mu&s;t &s;tand the brunt,
and perhaps give away his la&s;t guinea, as coolly as he would lend a nobleman
a &s;hilling.</P>
<P>OUR hero is now going off the &s;tage, and his cata&s;|trophe
is very tragical: the next news we hear of him is his death, atchieved by his
own hand, and with his own pi&s;tol. An inque&s;t is bribed, he is buried at
midnight, and forgotten before &s;un-ri&s;e.</P>
<P>THESE two portraits of a Sharper, wherein I have en|deavoured
to &s;hew different likene&s;&s;es in the &s;ame man, puts me in mind of an old
print, which I remember at <PB N="240" REF="245"> <HI>Oxford,</HI> of Count
<HI>Gui&s;card.</HI> At fir&s;t &s;ight he was ex|hibited in a full-bottom wig,
a hat and feather, embroi|dered cloaths, diamond buttons, and the full
court-dre&s;s of tho&s;e days: but by pulling a &s;tring, the folds of the
paper were &s;hifted, the face only remained, a new body came forward, and
Count <HI>Gui&s;card</HI> appeared to be a DEVIL.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear <HI>Jack!</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P> I WAS in hopes I &s;hould have met you at
<HI>Newmarket</HI> races, but to &s;ay the truth, if your luck had turned out
&s;o bad as mine, you did better to &s;tay away. <HI>Dick Riot, Tom
Lowngeit,</HI> and I went together to <HI>Newmarket</HI> the fir&s;t day of the
meeting. I was mounted on my little bay-mare that co&s;t me thirty guineas in
the North. I never cro&s;&s;ed a better tit in my life, and if her eyes
&s;tand, as I dare &s;ay they will, &s;he will turn out as tight a little Thing
as any in <HI>England.</HI> Then &s;he is as fleet as the wind. Why, I raced
with <HI>Dick</HI> and <HI>Tom</HI> all the way from <HI>Cambridge</HI> to
<HI>Newmarket: Dick</HI> rode his roan gelding, and <HI>Tom</HI> his che&s;nut
mare (which, you know, have both &s;peed) but I beat them <HI>hollow.</HI> I
cannot help telling you that I was dre&s;&s;ed in my blue riding-frock with
plate-buttons, with a leather belt round my wa&s;te, my jemmy turn-down boots
made by <HI>Tull,</HI> my brown &s;cratch bob, and my hat with the
narrow-&s;ilver lace cocked in the true &s;porting ta&s;te: &s;o that
altogether I don't believe there was a more <HI>knowing</HI> figure upon the
Cour&s;e. I was very flu&s;h too, <HI>Jack</HI>; for <HI>Michaelmas-day</HI>
happening damned luckily ju&s;t about the time of the races, I had ju&s;t
received fifty guineas for my quarteridge. As &s;oon as I came upon the
Cour&s;e, I met with &s;ome jolly bucks from <HI>London.</HI> I never &s;aw
them before; however we were &s;oon acquainted, and I took up the Odds: but I
was damnably let in, for I lo&s;t thirty pieces &s;lap the fir&s;t day. The day

</LETTER>
<P>I HAVE often lamented the narrow plan of our Univer|&s;ity
Education, and always ob&s;erve with plea&s;ure any at|tempts to enlarge and
improve it. In this light I cannot help looking on <HI>Newmarket</HI> as a
judicious &s;upplement to the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and would
recommend it to the young &s;tudents to repair duly thither twice a year. By
the&s;e means they may connect the knowledge of polite life with &s;tudy, and
come from college as deeply ver&s;ed in the genteel my&s;teries of Gaming, as
in <HI>Greek, Latin,</HI> and the Mathematicks. Attending the&s;e &s;olemnities
mu&s;t indeed be of great &s;ervice to every rank of &s;tudents. Tho&s;e who
are <PB N="244" REF="249"> intended for the Church have an opportunity of
tempering the &s;everity of their character by a happy mixture of the jockey
and clergyman. I have known &s;everal who by uni|ting the&s;e oppo&s;ite
qualifications, and meeting with a patron of their own di&s;po&s;ition, have
rode them&s;elves into a living in a good &s;porting country; and I doubt not,
if the excur&s;ions of gown&s;men to <HI>Newmarket</HI> meet with the
encouragement they de&s;erve, but we &s;hall &s;hortly &s;ee the Beacon
Cour&s;e crouded with ordained &s;port&s;men in &s;hort ca&s;&s;ocks. As to the
Fellow-Commoners, I do not &s;ee how they can pa&s;s their time more
profitably. The &s;ole intention of their re&s;idence at the Univer&s;ity is,
with mo&s;t of them, to while away a couple of years, which they cannot
conveniently di&s;po&s;e of otherwi&s;e. Their rank exempts them from the
common drudgery of lectures and exerci&s;es, and the Golden Tuft that adorns
their velvet caps is at once a badge of ho|nour and an apology for ignorance.
But as &s;ome of the&s;e gentlemen, though they never will be &s;cholars, may
turn out excellent jockeys, it is but ju&s;tice to let them carry &s;ome kind
of knowledge away with them; and as they can never &s;hine as adepts in Sir
<HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI>'s Philo&s;ophy, or critics on <HI>Homer</HI> and
<HI>Virgil,</HI> &s;uffer them to make a figure as arbiters of the Cour&s;e,
and followers of <HI>Aaron</HI> and <HI>Driver.</HI></P>
<P>I AM the more earne&s;t on this occa&s;ion, becau&s;e I look
upon Races as a diver&s;ion, peculiarly adapted to an Univer|&s;ity, and
founded upon cla&s;&s;ical principles. Every author who has mentioned the
Antient Games, includes the Race, and de&s;cribes it with great dignity. This
Game was always celebrated with great pomp, and all the <HI>people of
fa&s;hion</HI> of tho&s;e days were pre&s;ent at it. In the twenty third
<HI>Iliad</HI> in particular there is not only a di&s;pute at the Race, but a
bet propo&s;ed in as expre&s;s terms as at <HI>Newmarket.</HI> The wager 
<PB N="245" REF="250"> offered indeed is a goblet, which is not entirely in the
man|ner of our modern &s;port&s;men, who rather chu&s;e to melt down their
plate into the current &s;pecie, and bring their &s;ide|boards to the cour&s;e
in their pur&s;es. I am aware al&s;o that the Races celebrated by the ancients
were Chariot-Races: but even in the&s;e our young &s;tudents of the
Univer&s;ity have great emulation to excell: There are among them many very
good coachmen who often make excur&s;ions in tho&s;e noble vehicles with great
propriety called <HI>Phaetons,</HI> and drive with as much fury along the road,
as the charioteers in the An|tient Game flew towards the goal. In a word, if we
have not &s;uch noble Odes on this occa&s;ion as were produced of old, it is
not for want of a <HI>Theron</HI> but a <HI>Pindar.</HI></P>
<P>THE Advices which I have at &s;everal times received of the
influence of the Races at <HI>Newmarket</HI> on the Univer&s;ity give me great
plea&s;ure. It has not only improved the beha|viour of the &s;tudents but
enlarged their plan of &s;tudy. They are now very deeply read in
<HI>Bracken</HI>'s <HI>Farriery</HI> and the <HI>Compleat Jockey,</HI> know
exactly how many &s;tone they weigh, and are pretty competent judges of the
Odds. I went &s;ome time ago to vi&s;it a fellow-commoner, and when I arrived
at his chambers, found the door open, but my friend was not at home. The room
was adorned with <HI>Seymour</HI>'s prints of hor&s;es neatly framed and
glazed, a hat and whip hung on one hook, a pair of boots on another, and on the
table lay a formidable Quarto with the <HI>Sport&s;man</HI>'s <HI>Calendar</HI>
by <HI>Reginald Heber,</HI> E&s;q^r. I had the curio&s;ity to examine the book,
and as the college is remarkable for the &s;tudy of philo&s;ophy, I expected to
&s;ee <HI>Newton</HI>'s <HI>Principia,</HI> or perhaps <HI>Sander&s;on</HI>'s
<HI>Algebra:</HI> but on opening it, this huge volume proved to be a pompous
edition of <HI>Gib&s;on</HI>'s <HI>Treati&s;e on the Di&s;ea&s;es of
Hor&s;es.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="251">THESE indeed are noble &s;tudies, will
pre&s;erve our youth from pedantry, and make them men of the world. Men of
genius who are plea&s;ed with the theory of any art, will not be contented
'till they arrive at the practice. I am told that the young gentlemen often try
the &s;peed of the <HI>Cam|bridge</HI> Nags on the Beacon Cour&s;e, and that
&s;everal hacks are at pre&s;ent in training. I have often wondered that the
gentlemen who form the club at <HI>Newmarket</HI> never reflected on their
neighbourhood to <HI>Cambridge,</HI> nor e&s;tabli&s;hed (in honour of it) an
Univer&s;ity Plate, to be run for by <HI>Cam&s;brige</HI> hacks, rode by young
gentlemen of the Univer&s;ity. A hint of this kind will certainly be
&s;ufficient to have this laudable de&s;ign put in practice the very next

<P>_A FRIEND of mine lately gave me an account of a &s;et of
gentlemen, who meet together once a week under the name of <HI>The</HI> ENGLISH
CLUB. The title with which they dignify their Society ari&s;es from the chief
end of their meeting, which is to cultivate their Mother Tongue. They employ
half the time of their a&s;&s;embling in hearing &s;ome of our be&s;t
Cla&s;&s;ics read to them, which generally furni&s;hes them with conver&s;ation
for the re&s;t of the even|ing. They have in&s;tituted annual fe&s;tivals in
honour of <HI>Spen&s;er, Shake&s;pear, Milton,</HI> &amp;c. on each of which an
oration, inter&s;per&s;ed with encomiums on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> lan|guage,
is &s;poken in prai&s;e of the author, who, in the phra&s;e 
<PB N="248" REF="253"> of the almanack, gives the red letter to the day. They
have al&s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed a fund, from which hand&s;ome rewards are allotted
to tho&s;e who &s;hall &s;upply the place of any exotic terms that have been
&s;muggled into our language by home&s;pun <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> words equally
&s;ignificant and expre&s;|&s;ive. An order is al&s;o made again&s;t importing
any contra|band phra&s;es into the Club, by which heavy fines are laid on
tho&s;e who &s;hall have any modi&s;h barbari&s;ms found upon them: whether
they be foreign words, antient or modern, or any cant terms coined by <HI>The
Town</HI> for the &s;ervice of the current year.</P>
<P>THE whole account which I received from my friend gave me great
&s;atisfaction: and I never remember any &s;ociety that met together on &s;uch
commendable principles. Their proceedings it mu&s;t however be confe&s;&s;ed
are &s;omewhat unfa&s;hionable; for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue is become as
little the general care as <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Beef, or <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Hone&s;ty. Young gentlemen are obliged to drudge at &s;chool for nine or ten
years in order to &s;crape together as much <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI>
as they can forget during their tour abroad, and have com|monly at the &s;ame
time a private ma&s;ter to give them <HI>French</HI> enough to land them with
&s;ome reputation at <HI>Calais.</HI> This is to be &s;ure very prudent as well
as genteel. Yet &s;ome people are perver&s;e enough to imagine that to teach
boys a foreign language, living or dead, without at the &s;ame time grounding
them in their Mother Tongue is a very prepo&s;|terous plan of education. The
<HI>Romans,</HI> though they &s;tudied at <HI>Athens,</HI> directed their
&s;tudies to the benefit of their own country, and though they read
<HI>Greek,</HI> wrote in <HI>Latin.</HI> There are at this day in
<HI>France</HI> Academies e&s;ta|bli&s;hed for the &s;upport and pre&s;ervation
of the <HI>French</HI> lan|guage: and perhaps, if to the pre&s;ent
Profe&s;&s;or&s;hips of <HI>He|brew</HI> and <HI>Greek,</HI> there &s;hould be
added a Profe&s;&s;or&s;hip of the <PB N="249" REF="254"> <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
language, it would be no di&s;grace to our learned Univer&s;ities.</P>
<P>WHEN we con&s;ider that our language is preferable to mo&s;t if
not all others now in being, it &s;eems &s;omething extraordinary that any
attention &s;hould be paid to a foreign Tongue that is refu&s;ed to our own,
when we are likely to get &s;o little by the exchange. But when we reflect
further on the remarkable purity to which &s;ome late authors have brought it,
we are &s;till more concerned at the pre&s;ent neglect of it. This &s;hameful
neglect I take to be owing chiefly to the&s;e two rea&s;ons, the fal&s;e pride
of tho&s;e who are e&s;teemed men of learning, and the ridiculous affectation
of our fine gentlemen, and pretenders to wit.</P>
<P>IN complai&s;ance to our fine gentlemen, who are them|&s;elves
the allowed &s;tandards of politene&s;s, I &s;hall begin with them fir&s;t.
Their conver&s;ation exactly an&s;wers the de&s;crip|tion which
<HI>Benedick</HI> gives of <HI>Claudio</HI>'s: 
<Q REND="inline">"their words are a very fanta&s;tical banquet,
ju&s;t &s;o many &s;trange di&s;hes."</Q> The&s;e di&s;hes too are all
<HI>French</HI>; and I do not know whether their conver&s;ation does not a good
deal depend on their bill of fare, and whether the thin meagre diet, on which
our &s;ine gentlemen &s;ub&s;i&s;t, does not in &s;ome mea&s;ure take away the
power of that bold articulation nece&s;&s;ary to give utterance to manly
<HI>Briti&s;h</HI> accents: whence their conver&s;a|tion becomes &s;o 
<Q REND="inline">"fanta&s;tical a banquet,"</Q> and every
&s;entence they deliver almo&s;t as heterogeneous a mixture as a &s;alma|gundy.
A fa&s;hionable coxcomb now never complains of the vapours, but tells you that
he is very much <HI>ennuy&egrave;e.</HI>&mdash;He does not affect to be genteel
but <HI>degag&egrave;e</HI>&mdash;nor is he taken with an elegant &s;implicity
in a beautiful countenance, but breaks out in raptures on a <HI>je
ne-&s;cay-quoi,</HI> and a certain <HI>naivet&egrave;.</HI> In a word, his head
as well as his heels is en|tirely <PB N="250" REF="255"> <HI>French,</HI> and
he is a thorough <HI>petit maitre</HI> in his lan|guage as well as behaviour.
But notwith&s;tanding ail this, I do not know whether the conver&s;ation of our
pretenders to wit is not &s;till more barbarous. When they talk of
<HI>Humbug,</HI> &amp;c. they &s;eem to be jabbering in the uncouth dialect of
the <HI>Huns,</HI> or the rude gabble of the <HI>Hottentots:</HI> or if their
words are at all allied to the language of this country, it probably comes
neare&s;t to the &s;trange cant &s;aid to be in u&s;e among hou&s;ebreakers and
highwaymen; and if their jargon will bear any explanation, the curious are
mo&s;t likely to meet with it in a polite vocabulary lately pub|li&s;hed under
the title of the <HI>Scoundrel's Dictionary.</HI></P>
<P>MANY who are accounted men of learning, if they do not join with
fops and coxcombs to corrupt our language, at lea&s;t do very little to promote
it, and are &s;ometimes very indifferently acquainted with it. There are many
per&s;ons of both our Univer&s;ities who can decypher an old <HI>Greek</HI>
manu&s;cript, and con&s;true <HI>Lycophron extempore,</HI> who &s;carce know
the idiom of their own language, and are at a lo&s;s how to di&s;patch a
familiar letter with tolerable facility. The&s;e gentlemen &s;eem to think that
learning con&s;i&s;ts merely in being ver&s;ed in languages not generally
under&s;tood. But it &s;hould be con&s;idered, that the &s;ame Genius which
animated the Ancients has di&s;pen&s;ed at lea&s;t &s;ome portion of it's heat
to later ages, and particularly to the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> Tho&s;e who are
really charmed with <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Sophocles</HI> will hardly read
<HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> and <HI>Milton</HI> without emotion, and if I was
in|clined to carry on the parallel, I could perhaps mention as many great names
as <HI>Athens</HI> ever produced. 
<Q> 
<L>Multa poetarum veniet manus, auxilio quae</L> 
<L>Sit mihi.&mdash;</L> 
<BIBL>HOR.</BIBL></Q> The knowledge of <HI>Greek, Latin,</HI>
&amp;c. is certainly very <PB N="251" REF="256"> valuable, but this may be
attained without the lo&s;s of their Mother Tongue: for the&s;e reverend
gentlemen &s;hould know that languages are not like preferments in the Church,
too many of which cannot be held together.</P>
<P>THIS great neglect of our own Tongue is one of the principal
rea&s;ons that we are &s;o &s;eldom favoured with any publications from either
of our Univer&s;ities, which we might expect very often in con&s;ideration of
the great number of learned men who re&s;ide there. The pre&s;s being thus
de&s;ert|ed by tho&s;e who might naturally be expected to &s;upport it, falls
to the care of a &s;et of illiterate hirelings, in who&s;e hands it is no
wonder if the language is every day mangled, and &s;hould at la&s;t be utterly
de&s;troyed. Writing is well known to be at pre&s;ent as much a trade as any
handicraft whatever, and every man who can vamp up any thing for pre&s;ent
&s;ale, though void of &s;en&s;e or Syntax, is li&s;ted by the book&s;ellers as
an author. But allowing all our pre&s;ent writers to be men of parts and
learning (as there are doubtle&s;s &s;ome who may be reckoned &s;o) is it
probable that they &s;hould exert their abilities to the utmo&s;t, when they do
not write for fame, like the Ancients, but as a means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tance. If
<HI>Herodotus</HI> and <HI>Livy</HI> had &s;old their hi&s;tories at &s;o much
a &s;heet, and all the other <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Cla&s;&s;ics had
written in the &s;ame circum&s;tances with many modern authors, they would
hardly have merited all that applau&s;e they &s;o ju&s;tly receive at
pre&s;ent. The plays of <HI>Sophocles</HI> and <HI>Euripides</HI> might perhaps
not have been much better than modern Tragedies; <HI>Virgil</HI> might have got
a dinner by half a dozen <HI>Town Eclogues</HI>; and <HI>Horace</HI> have wrote
Birth-day Odes, or now and then a lampoon on the company at the
<HI>Baiae.</HI></P>
<P>A FALSE mode&s;ty is another great cau&s;e of the few
publications by men of eminence and learning. However <PB N="252" REF="257">
equal to the ta&s;k, they have not &s;ufficient confidence to venture to the
pre&s;s, but are rather guilty of wilful inju&s;tice to them&s;elves and to the
public. They are al&s;o a&s;hamed of appearing among the common herd of
authors. But the pre&s;s, though it is often abu&s;ed, &s;hould by no means be
accounted &s;candalous or di&s;honourable. Though a learned and ingenious
writer might not chu&s;e to be mu&s;tered in the &s;ame roll with &mdash;
&mdash; &mdash; or Mr. TOWN, yet we have a HOOKE, a BROWNE, an AKINSIDE, and
many others in who&s;e company it will be an honour to appear. I would not
willingly &s;uppo&s;e that they are afraid to hazard the cha|racters they now
maintain of being men of learning and abilities; for while we only take the&s;e
things for granted, their reputations are but weakly e&s;tabli&s;hed. To
re&s;cue our Native Language from the hands of ignorants and mercenaries is a
ta&s;k worthy tho&s;e who are accounted orna|ments of our Seats of Learning;
and it is &s;urely more than common ingratitude in tho&s;e who eat the bread of
lite|rature to refu&s;e their utmo&s;t endeavours to &s;upport it.</P>

<P>_A FEW years ago an ingenious player gave notice in the bills
for his Benefit Night, that the Prologue &s;hould be &s;poken by the Pit, which
he contrived to have repre&s;ented on the &s;tage. Another time he drew in the
whole hou&s;e to act as Chorus to a new farce, and I re|member that in the
la&s;t rebellion the loyal acclamations of 
<Q REND="inline">"God &s;ave the King"</Q> might have been heard
from <HI>Drury Lane</HI> to <HI>Charing Cro&s;s.</HI> Upon the&s;e and many
other oc|ca&s;ions the audience has been known to enter into the im|mediate
bu&s;ine&s;s of the Drama; and, to &s;ay the truth, I never go into the theatre
without looking on the &s;pectators as playing a part almo&s;t as much as the
actors them|&s;elves. <PB N="254" REF="259"> All the company from the
&s;tage-box to the upper gallery know their cues very well, and perform their
parts with great &s;pirit. I begun the &s;ea&s;on with a few ani|madver&s;ions
on the chief faults to which our performers are liable. To-day I &s;hall beg
leave to &s;ay a word or two to the Audience, as my reflections on the theatre
would otherwi&s;e be incomplete. On this occa&s;ion I expect the thanks of the
managers, and would recommend it to them to put my thirty fourth number into a
frame and gla&s;s, and hang it up in the Green Room for the benefit of the
play|ers; and to di&s;po&s;e three or four thou&s;and of the pre&s;ent number
into the &s;everal parts of the hou&s;e, as <HI>Bayes</HI> di&s;per&s;ed papers
to in&s;inuate the plot of his piece into the boxes.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t part of the audience that demands our atten|tion is
&s;o nearly allied to the actors that they always appear on the &s;ame level
with them: but while the performer endea|vours to carry on the bu&s;ine&s;s of
the play, the&s;e gentlemen be|hind the &s;cenes &s;erve only to hinder and
di&s;turb it. There is no part of the hou&s;e from which a play can be &s;een
to &s;o little advantage as from the &s;tage; yet this &s;ituation is very
convenient on many other con&s;iderations, of more con&s;e|quence to a fine
gentleman. It looks particular; it is the be&s;t place to &s;hew a hand&s;ome
per&s;on, or an elegant &s;uit of cloaths: a bow from the &s;tage to a beauty
in the box is mo&s;t likely to attract our notice; and a pretty fellow may
perhaps with tolerable management get the credit of an intrigue with &s;ome of
the actre&s;&s;es. But notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e advantages accruing to our
fine gentlemen, I could heartily wi&s;h they would leave a clear &s;tage to the
per|formers; or at lea&s;t that none &s;hould be admitted behind the &s;cenes,
but &s;uch as would &s;ubmit to be of &s;ome u&s;e there. As the&s;e gentlemen
are ready dre&s;t, they might help to &s;well the retinue of a monarch, join
the engagement in <PB N="255" REF="260"> a Tragedy-battle, or do any other
little office that might occur in the play, which requires but little &s;en&s;e
and no memory. But if they have not any genius for acting, and are &s;till
de&s;irous of retaining their po&s;ts by the &s;ide-&s;cenes, they &s;hould be
obliged to take a mu&s;ket, bayonet, pouch, and the re&s;t of the
accoutrements, and &s;tand on guard quietly and decently with the
&s;oldiers.</P>
<P>THE boxes are often filled with per&s;ons who do not come to the
theatre out of any regard to <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> or <HI>Garrick,</HI> but
like the fine lady in <HI>Lethe,</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"becau&s;e every body is there."</Q> As the&s;e
people cannot be expected to mind the play them|&s;elves, we can only de&s;ire
them not to call off the atten|tion of others; nor interrupt the dialogue on
the &s;tage by a louder conver&s;ation of their own. The &s;ilent court&s;hip
of the eyes, ogles, nods, glances, and curt&s;ies from one box to another may
be allowed them the &s;ame as at church, but nothing more, except at
Coronations, Funeral Proce&s;&s;ions and Pantomimes. Here I cannot help
recommending it to the gentlemen, who draw the pen from under their right ears
about &s;even o'clock, clap on a bag-wig and &s;word, and drop into the boxes
at the end of the third act, to take their halfcrown's worth with as much
decency as po&s;&s;ible; as well as the Bloods who reel from the taverns about
<HI>Covent Garden</HI> near that time, and tumble drunk into the boxes. Before
I quit this part of the hou&s;e I mu&s;t take notice of that di|vi&s;ion of the
upper-boxes, properly di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of the Fle&s;h Market.
There is frequently as much art u&s;ed to make the fle&s;h exhibited here look
whol&s;ome, and (as <HI>Tim</HI> &s;ays in the farce) 
<Q REND="inline">"all over red and white like the in&s;ide of a
&s;houlder of mutton,"</Q> as there is by the butchers to make their veal look
white; and it is as often rank carrion and flyblown. If the&s;e ladies would
appear <PB N="256" REF="261"> in any other quarter of the hou&s;e, I would only
beg of Them and tho&s;e who come to market, to drive their bargains with as
little noi&s;e as po&s;&s;ible: but I have lately ob&s;erved with &s;ome
concern that the&s;e women begin to ap|pear in the lower boxes to the
de&s;truction of all order, and great confu&s;ion of all mode&s;t ladies. It is
to be hoped that &s;ome of their friends will advi&s;e them not to pretend to
appear there any more than at court: for it is as ab&s;urd to endeavour the
removal of their market into the front and &s;ide boxes, as it would be in the
butchers of St. <HI>James's Mar|ket</HI> to attempt fixing the &s;hambles in
St. <HI>James's Square.</HI></P>
<P>I MUST now de&s;ire the reader to de&s;cend with me among laced
hats and capuchines into the Pit. The Pit is the grand Court of Critici&s;m,
and in the center of it is collected that awful body, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the
title of <HI>the Town.</HI> Hence are i&s;&s;ued the irrevocable decrees, and
here final &s;entence is pronounced on plays and players. This Court has often
been very &s;evere in its deci&s;ions, and has been known to declare many old
plays barbarou&s;ly murdered, and mo&s;t of our modern ones <HI>Felo de
&s;e;</HI> but it mu&s;t not be di&s;&s;embled that many a cau&s;e of great
con&s;e|quence has been denied a fair hearing. Parties and private cabals have
often been formed to thwart the progre&s;s of merit, or to e&s;pou&s;e
ignorance and dullne&s;s; for it is not wonderfull that the Parliament of
Critici&s;m, like all others, &s;hould be liable to corruption. In this
a&s;&s;embly Mr. TOWN was fir&s;t nominated CRITIC and CENSOR-GENERAL; but
con&s;idering the notorious bribery now prevailing, I think proper to declare,
(in imitation of <HI>Tom</HI> in the <HI>Con&s;cious Lovers)</HI> that I never
took a &s;ingle Order for my vote in all my life.</P>
<P>THOSE who pay their two &s;hillings at the door of the 
<PB N="257" REF="262"> Middle Gallery &s;eem to frequent the theatre purely for
the &s;ake of &s;eeing the play. Though the&s;e peaceful regions are
&s;ometimes di&s;turbed by the incur&s;ions of rattling ladies of plea&s;ure;
&s;ometimes contain per&s;ons of fa&s;hion in di&s;|gui&s;e, and &s;ometimes
critics in ambu&s;h. The greate&s;t fault I have to object to tho&s;e who fill
this quarter of the thea|tre, is their frequent and injudicious interruption of
the bu|&s;ine&s;s of the play by their applau&s;e. I have &s;een a bad actor
clapt two minutes together for ranting, or perhaps &s;hrugging his &s;houlders,
and making wry faces: and I have &s;een the natural cour&s;e of the
pa&s;&s;ions checked in a good one, by the&s;e ill-judged te&s;timonies of
their approbation. It is recorded of <HI>Betterton</HI> to his honour, that he
thought a deep &s;ilence through the whole hou&s;e, and a &s;trict attention to
his playing, the &s;tronge&s;t and &s;ure&s;t &s;igns of his being well
received.</P>
<P>THE inhabitants of the Upper-Gallery demand our no|tice as well
as the re&s;t of the theatre. The Trunk Maker of immortal memory was the mo&s;t
celebrated hero of the&s;e regions; but &s;ince he is departed, and no
able-bodied critic appointed in his room, I cannot help giving the &s;ame
caution to the Upper-Gallery as to the gentry a pair of &s;tairs lower. Some of
the under-comedians will perhaps be di&s;|plea&s;ed at this order, who are
proud of the&s;e applau&s;es, and rejoice to hear the lu&s;ty bangs from the
oaken towels of their friends again&s;t the wain&s;coat of the Upper-Gallery;
but I think they &s;hould not be allowed to &s;hatter the pannels without
amending our ta&s;te; &s;ince their thwacks, however vehement, are &s;eldom
laid on with &s;ufficient judgment to ratify our applau&s;e. It were better
therefore if all the pre|&s;ent twelvepenny critics of this town, who pre&s;ide
over our diver&s;ions in the Upper-Gallery, would content them&s;elves with the
inferior duties of their office; <HI>viz.</HI> to take care 
<PB N="258" REF="263"> that the play begins at the proper time, that the
mu&s;ic be|tween the acts is of a due length, and that the candles are
&s;nuffed in tune.</P>
<P>AFTER the&s;e brief admonitions concerning our behaviour at the
play, which are intended as a kind of <HI>vade mecum</HI> for the frequenters
of the theatre, I cannot conclude my paper more properly than with an extract
from the <HI>Tale of a Tub</HI> &s;hewing the judicious di&s;tribution of our
playhou&s;es into Boxes, Pit, and Galleries.</P>
<Q>I CONFESS, that there is &s;omething very refined in the
contrivance and &s;tructure of our modern theatres. For, fir&s;t; the pit is
&s;unk below the &s;tage that whatever <HI>weighty</HI> matter &s;hall be
delivered thence (whether it be <HI>lead</HI> or <HI>gold)</HI> may fall plum
into the jaws of certain <HI>critics</HI> (as I think they are called) which
&s;tand ready opened to devour them. Then, the boxes are built round, and
rai&s;ed to a level with the &s;cene, in deference to the ladies; becau&s;e,
that large portion of wit, laid out in rai&s;ing pruriences and protuberances,
is ob&s;erved to run much upon a line, and ever in a circle. The whi|ning
pa&s;&s;ions, and little &s;tarved conceits, are gently wafted up by their own
extreme levity, to the middle region, and there fix and are frozen by the
frigid under|&s;tandings of the inhabitants. Bomba&s;try and buffoonry, by
nature lofty and light, &s;oar highe&s;t of all, and would be lo&s;t in the
roof, if the prudent architect had not with much fore&s;ight contrived for them
a fourth place, called <HI>the Twelve-Penny-Gallery,</HI> and there planted a
&s;uitable co|lony, who greedily intercept them in their pa&s;&s;age.</Q>

<P>_I LATELY took a &s;urvey of the Female World, as CENSOR
GENERAL; and upon a &s;trict review was very much &s;urprized to find that
there is &s;carce any Woman to be met with, except among the lowe&s;t of the
vulgar. The &s;ex con&s;i&s;ts almo&s;t entirely of LADIES. Every <HI>Joan</HI>
is lifted into a Lady; and the maid and the mi&s;tre&s;s are equally dignified
with this polite title. The &s;tage|coaches are con&s;tantly filled with
Ladies&mdash;At <HI>Bartholomew Fair</HI> there is always a hop for the
Ladies&mdash;And if the Ladies in the drawing-room are employed at Whi&s;t,

kitchen.&mdash;In a word, whenever there is occa&s;ion to &s;peak of the Female
World, honourable mention is always made of them by the re&s;pectful
appellation of <HI>The</HI> LADIES: as the young and the old, the black and the
brown, the homely and the hand&s;ome, are all complai&s;antly included under
the general title of <HI>The</HI> FAIR.</P>
<P>SINCE therefore the Ladies of <HI>Great Britain</HI> make up
&s;o numerous a body, I &s;hould be loth to di&s;oblige &s;o con&s;ide|rable a
&s;i&s;ter-hood, and &s;hall devote this paper entirely to their &s;ervice. I
propo&s;e at pre&s;ent to mar&s;hal them into their re&s;pective ranks, and
upon a review I find that they may be ju&s;tly di&s;tributed under the&s;e five
divi&s;ions; <HI>viz.</HI> Married Ladies, Maiden or Young Ladies, Ladies of
Qua|lity, Fine Ladies, and la&s;tly (without affront to the good company)
Ladies of Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>I SHALL begin with the Married Ladies, as this order will be
found to be far the mo&s;t numerous, and includes all the married women in town
or country above the degree of a chair-woman or the trundler of a wheel-barrow.
The plain old <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> word Wife has long been di&s;carded in our
conver&s;ation, as being only fit for the broad mouths of the vulgar. A
well-bred ear is &s;tartled at the very &s;ound of Wife, as at a coar&s;e and
indelicate expre&s;&s;ion; and I ap|peal to any fa&s;hionable couple, whether
they would not be as much a&s;hamed to be mentioned together as man and wife,
as they would to appear together at court in a farthingale and trunk-breeches.
From <HI>Hyde Park Corner</HI> to <HI>Temple-Bar</HI> this mon&s;ter of a Wife
has not been heard of &s;ince the antiquated times of Dame and Your Wor|&s;hip;
and in the city every good hou&s;e-wife is at lea&s;t <HI>a Lady of the other
end of the town.</HI> In the country you might as well di&s;pute the
preten&s;ions of every foxhunter to <PB N="261" REF="268"> the title of
E&s;quire, as of his help-mate to that of Lady; and in every corporation town
whoever matches with a burge&s;s becomes a Lady by right of charter. My
cou&s;in VILLAGE, (from whom I have all my rural intelligence,) informs me,
that upon the &s;trictre&s;t enquiry there is but one Wife in the town where he
now lives, and that is the Par|&s;on's Wife, who is never mentioned by the
country Ladies but as a dowdy, and an old-fa&s;hioned creature. Such is the
great privilege of matrimony, that every female is enno|bled by changing her
&s;urname: for as every unmarried woman is a Mi&s;s, every married one by the
&s;ame courte&s;y is a Lady.</P>
<P>THE next order of dignified females is compo&s;ed of Maiden or
Young Ladies; which terms are &s;ynonymous, and are indifferently applied to
females of the age of fourteen or three&s;core. We mu&s;t not therefore be
&s;urprized to hear of Maiden Ladies, who are known to have had &s;everal
chil|dren, or to meet with Young Ladies that look like old dowagers. At the
hou&s;e of an acquaintance where I lately vi&s;ited, I was told that we were to
expect Mrs. <HI>Jack&s;on</HI> and the two Mi&s;s <HI>Wrinkles.</HI> But what
was my &s;urprize! when I &s;aw on their arrival a blooming female of
twenty-five acco&s;ted under the fir&s;t denomination, and the two nymphs, as I
expected, come tottering into the room, the younge&s;t of them to all
appearance on the verge of three|&s;core. I could not help wi&s;hing on this
occa&s;ion that &s;ome middle term was invented between <HI>Mi&s;s</HI> and
<HI>Mrs.</HI> to be adopted, at a certain age, by all females not inclined to
matrimony. For &s;urely nothing can be more ridiculous, than to hear a
greyhaired Lady pa&s;t her Grand Climacteric mentioned in terms, that convey
the idea of youth and beauty, or perhaps of a bib and hanging-&s;leeves. This
indi&s;criminate appellation al&s;o unavoidably creates much 
<PB N="262" REF="269"> confu&s;ion: I know an eminent trade&s;man who lo&s;t a
very good cu&s;tomer for innocently writing <HI>Mrs.</HI> &mdash; at the head
of her bill: and I was lately at a ball, where, tru&s;ting to a friend for a
partner, I was obliged to do penance with an old withered beldam, who hobbled
through &s;everal country dances with me, though &s;he was ancient enough to
have been my grandmother. Excluding the&s;e Young Ladies of fifty and &s;ixty,
this order of females is very numerous; for there is &s;carce a girl in town or
country, &s;uperior to a milk|maid or cinderwench, but is comprehended in it.
The daughters are indi&s;putably Young Ladies, though their Papas may be
trade&s;men or mechanics. For the pre&s;ent race of &s;hopkeepers &amp;c. have
wi&s;ely provided, that their gentility &s;hall be pre&s;erved in the female
part of the family. Thus, although the &s;on is called plain <HI>Jack,</HI> and
perhaps bound apprentice to his father, the daughter is taught to hold up her
head, make tea in the little parlour behind the &s;hop, and inherits the title
of Lady from her Mama. To make the&s;e claims to dignity more &s;ure tho&s;e
excellent &s;eminaries of genteel education, called Boarding-Schools, have been
contrived; where in&s;tead of teazing a &s;ampler, or conning a chapter of the
bible, the Young Ladies are in&s;tructed to hold up their heads, make a
curt&s;ey, and to behave them&s;elves in every re&s;pect like pretty little
Ladies. Hence it happens, that we may often ob&s;erve &s;everal of the&s;e
polite dam&s;els in the &s;kirts of <HI>White-Chapel,</HI> and in every petty
country town; nay, it is common to meet with Young Ladies <HI>born and
bred,</HI> who have &s;ubmitted to keep a chandler's &s;hop, or had humility
enough even to go to &s;ervice.</P>
<P>I PROCEED next to take into con&s;ideration what is gene|rally
under&s;tood by Ladies of Quality. The&s;e in other words may be more properly
called Ladies of Fa&s;hion; for in the modi&s;h acceptation of the phra&s;e not
&s;o much re|gard <PB N="263" REF="270"> is had to their birth or &s;tation, or
even to their co|ronet, as to their way of life. The dutche&s;s, who has not
ta&s;te enough to act up to the character of a Per&s;on of Quality, is no more
re&s;pected in the polite world than a city knight's Lady; nor does &s;he
derive any greater honour from her title, than the hump-backed woman receives
from the vulgar. But what is immediately expected from a Lady of Quality, will
be &s;een under the next article: for to their prai&s;e be it &s;poken, mo&s;t
of our modern Ladies of Quality affect to be Fine Ladies.</P>
<P>TO de&s;cribe the life of a Fine Lady would be only to &s;et
down a perpetual round of vi&s;iting, gaming, dre&s;&s;ing, and intriguing. She
has been bred up in the notion of making a figure, and of recommending
her&s;elf as a woman of &s;pirit: for which end &s;he is always foremo&s;t in
the fa&s;hion, and never fails gracing with her appearance every public
a&s;&s;embly, and every party of plea&s;ure. Though &s;in|gle, &s;he may coquet
with every fine gentleman; or if mar|ried, &s;he may admit of gallantries
without reproach, and even receive vi&s;its from the men in her bed-chamber. To
complete the character, and to make her a Very Fine Lady, &s;he &s;hould be
celebrated for her wit and beauty, and be parted from her hu&s;band: for as
matrimony it&s;elf is not meant as a re&s;traint upon a plea&s;ure, a
&s;eparate maintenance is under&s;tood as a licence to throw off even the
appearance of virtue.</P>
<P>FROM the Fine Ladies it is a very natural tran&s;ition to the
Ladies of Plea&s;ure; and indeed from what has already been &s;aid concerning
Fine Ladies one might imagine that, as they make plea&s;ure their &s;ole
pur&s;uit, they might pro|perly be entitled Ladies of Plea&s;ure. But this gay
appella|tion is re&s;erved for the higher rank of Pro&s;titutes, who&s;e 
<PB N="264" REF="271"> principal difference from the Fine Ladies con&s;i&s;ts
in their profe&s;&s;ing a trade, which the others carry on by &s;mug|gling. A
Lady of Fa&s;hion, who refu&s;es no favours but the la&s;t, or even grants that
without being paid for it, is not to be accounted a Lady of Plea&s;ure, but
ranks in an order formerly celebrated under the title of DEMI-REPS. It is
whim&s;ical enough to &s;ee the different complexions a&s;&s;umed by the &s;ame
vice, according to the difference of &s;tations. The married Lady of Quality
may intrigue with as many as &s;he plea&s;es, and &s;till remain <HI>Right
Honourable:</HI> The draggle-tailed Street-Walker is a <HI>Common Woman,</HI>
and li|able to be &s;ent to <HI>Bridewell</HI>; but the Whore of High Life is a
<HI>Lady of Plea&s;ure,</HI> and rolls in a gilt chariot.</P>

<P>_WHEN I fir&s;t re&s;olved on appearing in my pre&s;ent
character, I had &s;ome thoughts of making my public entry in the front of one
or other of our News-papers; as I con|&s;idered that the dome&s;tic
occurrences, which compo&s;e a part of their equipage, would make no bad figure
in my own retinue. Some reflections on the modi&s;h methods of gaming, would
receive an additional confir|mation from a paragraph in the News, that 
<Q REND="inline">"la&s;t Tue&s;day a game at Whi&s;t was played
at <HI>White</HI>'s for 1000<HI>l.</HI> a corner,"</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"or that the match between his Grace the Duke of
&mdash; and Lord &mdash; was decided at <HI>Newmarket:</HI>"</Q> and a
di&s;&s;erta|tion on the luxury of the pre&s;ent age would be very aptly 
<PB N="266" REF="273"> illu&s;trated by an exact account of the weight of the
Turtle dre&s;&s;ed a few days before for the gentlemen of the above|mentioned
Chocolate-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>INDEED I have always looked upon the works of Mr.
<HI>Jenour</HI> in the <HI>Daily Adverti&s;er</HI> as a kind of &s;upplement to
the intelligence of Mr. TOWN; as containing a more minute account of the
important tran&s;actions of that cla&s;s of man|kind, which has been
figuratively &s;tiled <HI>The World.</HI> From the&s;e daily regi&s;ters, you
may not only learn when any body is married or hanged, but you have immediate
notice, whenever his Grace goes to <HI>Newmarket,</HI> or her Lady&s;hip &s;ets
out for <HI>Bath:</HI> and but la&s;t week, at the &s;ame time that the
gentlemen of the law were told that the Lord Chan|cellor could not &s;it in the
Court of Chancery, people of fa&s;hion had the melancholy news that Signor
<HI>Ricciarelli</HI> was not able to &s;ing.</P>
<P>NOR is that part of Mr. <HI>Jenour</HI>'s lucubrations, which is
allotted to Adverti&s;ements, le&s;s amu&s;ing and entertaining: and many of
the&s;e articles might very properly come under my cognizance. It is here
debated, whether the prize of eloquence &s;hould be given to Orator
<HI>Macklin</HI> or Orator <HI>Henley</HI>; and whether Mr. <HI>Stephen
Pitts</HI> is not the be&s;t qualified to furni&s;h gentlemen and ladies
libraries with tea|che&s;ts in <HI>Octavo,</HI> and clo&s;e-&s;tools in
<HI>Folio.</HI> And be&s;ides the public notices to per&s;ons of ta&s;te, of
very rare and old Japan, and mo&s;t curious and inimitable <HI>Epagnes</HI> for
de&s;erts, as al&s;o the mo&s;t rich and elegant fancied &s;ilks to be &s;old
by auction; many other advices not le&s;s intere&s;ting to the Town, are here
given. We are daily put in mind, that Mrs. <HI>Phillips</HI> at the Green
Cani&s;ter &s;till hopes for the favours of her former good cu&s;tomers as
u&s;ual: that next door to <HI>Had|docks</HI>'s <PB N="267" REF="274"> is
&s;old an antidote again&s;t the poi&s;on imbibed at that bagnio: that Dr.
<HI>Rock</HI> infallibly cures a certain epidemical di&s;temper by virtue of
the King's Patent: that a learned phy&s;ician and &s;urgeon will privately
accommodate any gentleman (as the Doctor mode&s;tly expre&s;&s;es it in his own
<HI>Latin) Pro Morbus Vaneria curandus:</HI> and that Y. Z. a regu|lar-bred
&s;urgeon and man-midwife, together with fifty others, will accommodate
gentlewomen, that are under a nece&s;&s;ity of lying in privately.</P>
<P>BUT not only the public tran&s;actions of Auctioneers, Brokers,
and Hor&s;e-dealers, but the mo&s;t private concerns of plea&s;ure and
gallantry may be al&s;o carried on by means of this paper. A&s;&s;ignations are
here made, and the mo&s;t &s;ecret intrigues formed at the expence of two
&s;hillings. If a genteel young body, who can do all kinds of work, wants a
place, &s;he will be &s;ure to hear of a ma&s;ter by adverti&s;ing: Any
gentleman and lady of <HI>unexceptionable character</HI> may meet with lodgings
to be let, and no que&s;tions a&s;ked: How often has <HI>Romeo</HI> declared in
print his un&s;peakable pa&s;&s;ion for the charming <HI>Peachy!</HI> How many
gentlemen have made open profe&s;&s;ions of the &s;tricte&s;t honour and
&s;e|cre&s;y! And how many ladies, dre&s;t in &s;uch a manner, and &s;een at
&s;uch a place, have been de&s;ired to leave a line for <HI>A.B.</HI> Before
the late Marriage Act it was very u&s;ual for young gentlemen and ladies
(po&s;&s;e&s;t of every qualification requi&s;ite to make the marriage &s;tate
happy) to offer them&s;elves as a good bargain to each other; and men took the
&s;ame mea|&s;ures of adverti&s;ing to get an agreeable companion for life, as
they do for an agreeable companion in a po&s;t-chai&s;e. As this traffick in
matrimony is now prohibited, it has given occa&s;ion to the opening a new
branch of trade; and &s;ince hu&s;bands and wives are hardly to be got for love
or money, &s;everal good-natured females have &s;et them&s;elves up to &s;ale 
<PB N="268" REF="275"> to the be&s;t bidder. The <HI>Daily Adverti&s;er</HI> is
therefore be|come the univer&s;al regi&s;ter for new faces; and every day's
adverti&s;ements are crouded with offers of young ladies, who would be glad of
the company of any elderly gentleman, to pa&s;s his lei&s;ure hours with them,
and <HI>play at cards.</HI></P>
<P>I LOOK upon the common intelligence in our public papers, with
the long train of adverti&s;ements annexed to it, as the be&s;t account of the
pre&s;ent dome&s;tic &s;tate of <HI>England,</HI> that can po&s;&s;ibly be
compiled: nor do I know any thing which would give po&s;terity &s;o clear an
idea of the ta&s;te and morals of the pre&s;ent age, as a bundle of our daily
papers. They would here &s;ee what books are mo&s;t read, what are our chief
amu&s;ements and diver&s;ions: and when they &s;hould ob&s;erve the daily
inquiries after eloped wives and apprentices, and the frequent accounts of
trials in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall</HI> for Perjury, Adultery, &amp;c. they
might form a tolerable notion even of our private life. Among many other
rea&s;ons for lamenting that the Art of Printing was not more early
di&s;covered, I cannot but regret that we have perhaps lo&s;t many accounts of
this nature, which might o|therwi&s;e have been handed down to us. With what
plea|&s;ure &s;hould we have peru&s;ed an <HI>Athenian</HI> Adverti&s;er, or a
<HI>Roman</HI> Gazetteer! A curious critic or antiquarian would place them on
the &s;ame &s;helf with the Cla&s;&s;ics, and would be highly plea&s;ed at
di&s;covering what days <HI>Tully</HI> went to his <HI>Tu&s;culum,</HI> or
<HI>Pliny</HI> to his magnificent <HI>Villa</HI>; who was the capital &s;inger
at the <HI>Graecian</HI> Opera, and in what characters <HI>Ro&s;cius</HI>
appeared with mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;s. The&s;e pieces of intel|ligence would
undoubtedly give great &s;atisfaction; and I am my&s;elf acquainted with a very

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IT is whim&s;ical to ob&s;erve the mi&s;takes that we country
gentlemen are led into at our fir&s;t coming to town. We are induced to think,
and indeed truly, that your fine ladies are compo&s;ed of different materials
from our rural ones; &s;ince, though they &s;leep all day and rake all night,
they &s;till remain as fre&s;h and ruddy as a par&s;on's daughter or a farmer's
wife. At other times we are apt to wonder, that &s;uch delicate creatures as
they ap|pear &s;hould yet be &s;o much proof again&s;t cold, as to look as
ro&s;y in <HI>January</HI> as in <HI>June,</HI> and even in the &s;harpe&s;t
weather <PB N="272" REF="279"> to be very unwilling to approach the fire. I was
at a lo&s;s to account for this unalterable hue of their complexions: but I
&s;oon found that beauty was not more peculiar to the air of St.
<HI>James</HI>'s than of <HI>York</HI>; and that this perpetual bloom was not
native, but imported from abroad. Not content with that red and white which
nature gave, your belles are reduced (as they pretend) to the nece&s;&s;ity of
&s;upplying the flu&s;h of health with the <HI>rouge</HI> of vermilion, and
giving us <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> wool for <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> beauty.</P>
<P>THE very rea&s;on alledged for this fa&s;hionable practice is
&s;uch, as (if they &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idered it) the ladies would be
a&s;hamed to mention. 
<Q REND="inline">"The late hours they are <HI>obliged</HI> to
keep, render them &s;uch <HI>perfect frights,</HI> that they would be as loth
to appear abroad without paint as without cloaths."</Q> This, it mu&s;t be
acknowledged, is too true: But would they &s;uffer their fathers or their
hu&s;bands to wheel them down for one month to the old man&s;ion-hou&s;e, they
would &s;oon be &s;en&s;ible of the change, and &s;oon per|ceive how much the
early walk exceeds the late a&s;&s;embly. The vigils of the card-table have
&s;poiled many a good face; and I have known a beauty &s;tick to the midnight
rubbers, till &s;he has grown as homely as the Queen of Spades. There is
nothing more certain in all <HI>Hoyle</HI>'s ca&s;es, than that Whi&s;t and
late hours will ruin the fine&s;t &s;et of features: but if the ladies would
give up their routes for the healthy amu&s;e|ments of the country, I will
venture to &s;ay their carmine would be then as u&s;ele&s;s as their artificial
no&s;egays.</P>
<P>A MORALIST might talk to them of the heinou&s;ne&s;s of this
practice; &s;ince all deceit is criminal, and painting is no better than
looking a lye. And &s;hould they urge that nobody is deceived by it, he might
add, that the plea for admitting it is then at an end; &s;ince few are yet
arrived at <PB N="273" REF="280"> that height of <HI>French</HI> politene&s;s,
as to dre&s;s their cheeks in public, and to profe&s;s wearing vermilion as
openly as powder. But I &s;hall content my&s;elf with u&s;ing an argu|ment more
likely to prevail: and &s;uch I tru&s;t will be the a&s;&s;urance, that this
practice is highly di&s;agreeable to the men. What mu&s;t be the mortification,
and what the di&s;gu&s;t of the lover, who goes to bed to a bride as blooming
as an angel, and finds her in the morning as wan and yellow as a corp&s;e? For
marriage &s;oon takes off the ma&s;k; and all the re&s;ources of art, all the
my|&s;teries of the toilet are then at an end. He that is thus wedded to a
cloud in&s;tead of a <HI>Juno,</HI> may well be al|lowed to complain, but
without relief: for this is a cu&s;tom, which once admitted &s;o tarni&s;hes
the &s;kin, that it is next to impo&s;&s;ible ever to retrieve it. Let me
therefore caution tho&s;e young beginners, who are not yet di&s;coloured pa&s;t
redemption, to leave it off in time, and endeavour to procure and pre&s;erve by
early hours that unaffected bloom, which art cannot give, and which only age or
&s;ickne&s;s can take away.</P>
<P>OUR beauties were formerly above making u&s;e of &s;o poor an
artifice: They tru&s;ted to the lively colouring of nature, which was
heightened by temperance and exerci&s;e; but our modern belles are obliged to
retouch their cheeks every day, to keep them in repair. We were then as
&s;uperior to the <HI>French</HI> in the a&s;&s;embly as in the field: but
&s;ince a trip to <HI>France</HI> has been thought a requi&s;ite in the
education of our ladies as well as gentlemen, our polite females have thought
fit to dre&s;s their faces as well as their heads <HI>a l&agrave; mode de
Paris.</HI> I am told, that when an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> lady is at
<HI>Paris,</HI> &s;he is &s;o &s;urrounded with fal&s;e faces, that &s;he is
her&s;elf obliged (if &s;he would not appear &s;ingular) to put on 
<PB N="274" REF="281"> the ma&s;k. But who would exchange the brilliancy of the
diamond for the faint lu&s;tre of <HI>French</HI> pa&s;te? And for my part I
would as &s;oon expect, that an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> beauty at <HI>Morocco</HI>
would japan her face with lamb-black, in complai&s;ance to the &s;able beauties
of that country. Let the <HI>French</HI> ladies white|wa&s;h and plai&s;ter
their fronts, and lay on their colours with a trowel: but the&s;e dawbings of
art are no more to be com|pared to the genuine glow of a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI>
cheek, than the coar&s;e &s;treaks of the painter's bru&s;h can re&s;emble the
native veins of the marble. This contra&s;t is placed in a proper light in Mr.
<HI>Addi&s;on</HI>'s fine epigram on Lady <HI>Manche&s;ter</HI>; which will
&s;erve to convince us of the force of undi&s;&s;embled beauty. 
<Q> 
<L>When haughty <HI>Gallia</HI>'s dames, that &s;pread</L> 
<L>O'er their pale checks a lifele&s;s red,</L> 
<L>Beheld this beauteous &s;tranger there,</L> 
<L>In native charms divinely fair,</L> 
<L>Confu&s;ion in their looks they &s;how'd,</L> 
<L>And with unborrow'd blu&s;hes glow'd.</L></Q> I think, Mr.
TOWN, you might ea&s;ily prevail on your fair readers to leave off this
unnatural practice, if you could once thoroughly convince them, that it impairs
their beauty in&s;tead of improving it. A lady's face, like the coats in the
<HI>Tale of a Tub,</HI> if left to it&s;elf, will wear well; but if you offer
to load it with foreign orna|ments, you de&s;troy the original ground.</P>
<P>AMONG other matter of wonder on my fir&s;t coming to town, I
was much &s;urpri&s;ed at the general appearance of youth among the ladies. At
pre&s;ent there is no di&s;tinction in their complexions between a beauty in
her teens and a lady in her grand climacteric: yet at the &s;ame time I 
<PB N="275" REF="282"> could not but take notice of the wonderful variety in
the face of the &s;ame lady. I have known an olive beauty on a Monday grow very
ruddy and blooming on Tue&s;day; turn pale on Wedne&s;day; come round to the
olive hue again on Thur&s;day; and in a word, change her complexion as often as
her gown. I was amazed to find no old aunts in this town, except a few
unfa&s;hionable people, whom no body knows; the re&s;t &s;till continuing in
the zenith of their youth and health, and falling off, like timely fruit,
without any previous decay. All this was a my&s;tery that I could not unriddle,
'till on being introduced to &s;ome ladies, I unluckily improved the hue of my
lips at the expence of a fair one, who unthinkingly had turned her cheek; and
found that my ki&s;&s;es were given, (as is ob&s;erved in the epi|gram) like
tho&s;e of <HI>Pyramus,</HI> through a wall. I then found, that this
&s;urpri&s;ing youth and beauty was all counterfeit; and that (as
<HI>Hamlet</HI> &s;ays) 
<Q REND="inline">"God had given them one face, and they had
made them&s;elves another."</Q></P>
<P>I HAVE mentioned the accident of my carrying off half a lady's
face by a &s;alute, that your courtly dames may learn to put on their faces a
little tighter; but as for my own daughters, while &s;uch fa&s;hions prevail,
they &s;hall &s;till re|main in <HI>York&s;hire.</HI> There, I think, they are
pretty &s;afe; for this unnatural fa&s;hion will hardly make its way into the
country, as this vamped complexion would not &s;tand again&s;t the rays of the
&s;un, and would inevitably melt away in a country dance. The ladies have,
indeed, been always the greate&s;t enemies to their own beauty, and &s;eem to
have a de&s;ign again&s;t their own faces. At one time the whole countenance
was eclip&s;ed in a black velvet ma&s;k; at another it was blotted with
patches; and at pre&s;ent it is cru&s;ted over with plai&s;ter of
<HI>Paris.</HI> In tho&s;e battered belles, who &s;till <PB N="276" REF="283">
aim at conque&s;t, this practice is in &s;ome &s;ort excu&s;able; but it is
&s;urely as ridiculous in a young lady to give up beauty for paint, as it would
be to draw a good &s;et of teeth merely to fill their places with a row of
ivory.</P>
<P>INDEED, &s;o common is this fa&s;hion among the young as well
as the old, that when I am in a groupe of beau|ties, I con&s;ider them as &s;o
many pretty pictures; looking about me with as little emotion, as I do at
<HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s: And if any thing fills me with admiration, it is the
judi|cious arrangement of the tints, and the delicate touches of the painter.
Art very often &s;eems almo&s;t to vye with nature: but my attention is too
frequently diverted by con&s;idering the texture and hue of the &s;kin beneath;
and the picture fails to charm, while my thoughts are engro&s;&s;ed by the wood
and canva&s;s.</P>

<P>_IT has hitherto been imagined, that though we have equalled, if
not &s;urpa&s;&s;ed, the ancients in other liberal arts, we have not yet been
able to arrive at that height of eloquence, which was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in &s;o
amaz|ing a manner by the <HI>Grecian</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Orators. Whether
this has been owing to any peculiar organization of our tongues, or whether it
has proceeded from our national love of taciturnity, I &s;hall not take upon me
to determine: but I will now venture to affirm, that the pre&s;ent times might
furni&s;h us with a more &s;urpri&s;ing number of Fine Speakers, than have been
&s;et down by <HI>Tully</HI> in his treati&s;e <HI>De Claris Oratoribus.</HI>
Foreigners can no longer object to us, that the northern coldne&s;s of our
climate has (as it were) <PB N="278" REF="285"> pur&s;ed up our lips, and that
we are afraid to open our mouths: The charm is at length di&s;&s;olved; and our
people, who before affected the gravity and &s;ilence of the <HI>Spaniard,</HI>
have adopted and naturalized the volubility of &s;peech, as well as the gay
manners, of the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>THIS change has been brought about by the public-&s;pirited
attempts of tho&s;e elevated geniu&s;&s;es, who have in&s;ti|tuted certain
&s;chools for the cultivation of eloquence in all its branches. Hence it is,
that in&s;tead of languid di&s;cour&s;es from the pulpit, &s;everal tabernacles
and meeting-hou&s;es have been &s;et up, where lay-preachers may di&s;play all
the powers of oratory in &s;ighs and groans, and emulate a <HI>White|field</HI>
or a <HI>We&s;ley</HI> in all the figures of rhetoric.&mdash;And not only the
enthu&s;ia&s;t has his conventicles, but even the free-thinker boa&s;ts his
Societies, where he may hold forth again&s;t reli|gion in tropes, metaphors,
and &s;imilies. The declamations weekly thundered out at <HI>Clare-Market,</HI>
and the &s;ubtle argu|mentations at the <HI>Robin Hood,</HI> I have formerly
celebrated: It now remains to pay my re&s;pects to the <HI>Martin Luther</HI>
of the age, (as he frequently calls him&s;elf,) the great <HI>Orator</HI>
MACKLIN; who by declaiming him&s;elf, and opening a &s;chool for the
di&s;putations of others, has joined both the above plans together, and formed
the BRITISH INQUISITION. Here, whatever concerns the world of ta&s;te and
literature, is debated: Our rakes and bloods, who had been u&s;ed to fre|quent
<HI>Covent-Garden</HI> merely for the &s;ake of whoring and drinking, now
re&s;ort thither for rea&s;on and argument; and the <HI>Piazza</HI> begins to
vie with the ancient <HI>Portico,</HI> where <HI>Socrates</HI> di&s;puted.</P>
<P>BUT what plea&s;es me mo&s;t in Mr. MACKLIN's In&s;ti|tution is,
that he has allowed the tongues of my fair country-women their full play. Their
natural talents for <PB N="279" REF="286"> Oratory are &s;o excellent and
numerous, that it &s;eems more owing to the envy than prudence of the other
&s;ex, that they &s;hould be denied the opportunity of exerting them. The
remarkable tendency in our polite&s;t ladies 
<Q REND="inline">"to talk, though they have nothing to
&s;ay;"</Q> and the torrent of eloquence that pours (on the mo&s;t trivial
occa&s;ions) from the lips of tho&s;e females, called Scolds; give abundant
proofs of that command of words, and flow of eloquence, which &s;o few men have
been able to attain. Again, if action is the life and &s;oul of an oration, how
many advantages have the ladies in this particular? The waving of a &s;nowy
arm, art|fully &s;haded with the enchanting &s;lope of a double ruffle, would
have twenty times the force of the &s;tiff &s;ee-&s;aw of a male orator: and
when they come to the mo&s;t ani|mated parts of the oration, which demand
uncommon warmth and agitation, we &s;hould be vanqui&s;hed by the heaving
brea&s;t, and all tho&s;e other charms, which the modern dre&s;s is &s;o well
calculated to di&s;play.</P>
<P>SINCE the ladies are thus undeniably endued with the&s;e and
many other accompli&s;hments for Oratory, that no place &s;hould hitherto have
been opened for their exerting them, is almo&s;t unaccountable. The lower order
of fe|males have, indeed, long ago in&s;tituted an academy of this kind at the
other end of the town, where oy&s;ters and eloquence are in equal perfection:
but the politer part of the female world have hitherto had no further
opportunity of exerci&s;ing their abilities, than the common occa&s;ions which
a new cap or petenlair, the tea or the card table, have afforded them. I am
therefore heartily glad, that a plan is at length put in execution, which will
encourage their propen&s;ity to talking, and enlarge their topics of
conver&s;ation: but I would more particularly recommend <PB N="280" REF="287">
it to all ladies of a clamorous di&s;po&s;ition, to attend at MACK|LIN's; that
the impetuous &s;tream of eloquence, which, for want of another vent, has long
been poured on their &s;ervants or hu&s;bands, may now be carried off by
another more agreeable channel.</P>
<P>I COULD not have thought it po&s;&s;ible, that this under|taking
would have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted two nights without &s;etting all the female tongues
from <HI>St. James's</HI> to <HI>Temple-Bar</HI> in motion. But the ladies have
hitherto been dumb; and Female Eloquence &s;eems as unlikely to di&s;play
it&s;elf in pub|lick as ever. Whether their mode&s;ty will not permit them to
open their mouths in the unhallowed air of <HI>Covent-Gar|den,</HI> I know not:
but I am rather inclined to think, that the Que&s;tions propo&s;ed have not
been &s;ufficiently calcu|lated for the female part of the a&s;&s;embly. They
might perhaps be tempted to debate, 
<Q REND="inline">"whether <HI>Fanny Murray</HI> or Lady &mdash;
were the propere&s;t to lead the fa&s;hion;"&mdash;</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"to what lengths a lady might proceed without
the lo&s;s of her reputation;"&mdash;</Q>or 
<Q REND="inline">"whether the Beautifying Lotion or the Royal
Wa&s;hball were the mo&s;t excellent Co&s;metics."</Q> It might al&s;o be
expected, in complai&s;ance to the fair &s;ex, that the INQUISITOR &s;hould now
and then read a di&s;&s;er|tation on Natural and Artificial Beauty; in which he
might (with that &s;oftne&s;s and delicacy peculiar to him&s;elf) analy&s;e a
lady's face, and give examples of the ogle, the &s;imper, the &s;mile, the
langui&s;h, the dimple, &amp;c. with a word or two on the u&s;e and benefit of
paint.</P>
<P>BUT the&s;e points I &s;hall leave to Mr. MACKLIN's
con|&s;ideration: In the mean time, as it is not in my power to oblige the
public with a Lady's Speech, I &s;hall fill up the remainder of my paper with
an Oration, which my corre&s;|pondent is de&s;irous &s;hould appear in print,
though he had not &s;ufficient confidence to deliver it at the INQUISITION.</P>

<HEAD>QUESTION. Whether the Stage might not be made more
conducive to Virtue?</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>Mr. INQUISITOR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE ancient drama had, we know, a religious as well as
political view; and was de&s;igned to in&s;pire the audience with a reverence
to the Gods and a love of their country. Our own Stage, upon particular
occa&s;ions, has been made to an&s;wer the &s;ame ends: Thus we may remember
during the la&s;t rebellion, be&s;ides the loyalty of the fiddles in the
Orche&s;tra, we were in&s;pired with a dete&s;ta|tion of the pope and pretender
by the <HI>Nonjuror,</HI> the <HI>Je&s;uit Caught,</HI> and &s;uch other
politico-religious dramas; among which I mu&s;t not forget to
mention&mdash;(what's the name on't, Mr. INQUISITOR?&mdash;what's the name
on't?&mdash;oh)&mdash;<HI>Perkin Warbeck, Or the Popi&s;h Impo&s;tor.</HI></P>
<P>BUT there is a &s;pecies of the drama, which has not yet
been mentioned by any of the gentlemen who have &s;poke to the que&s;tion, and
which is very deficient in point of moral: I mean, Pantomimes. Mr.
<HI>Laws</HI> has been very &s;evere on the impiety of repre&s;enting heathen
gods and godde&s;&s;es before a truly Chri&s;tian audience: and to this we may
add, that Harlequin is but a wicked &s;ort of fellow, and is always running
after the girls. For my part I have often blu&s;hed to &s;ee this impudent rake
endeavouring to creep under Columbine's petticoats, and at other times patting
her neck, and laying his legs upon her lap. Nobody will &s;ay indeed, that
there is much virtue or morality in the&s;e entertainments: though it mu&s;t be
confe&s;&s;ed to the honour of our neighbour|ing hou&s;e here, that the
<HI>Necromancer</HI> and the <HI>Sorcerer,</HI> after having played many
unchri&s;tian pranks upon the &s;tage, are at la&s;t fairly &s;ent to the
devil. I would therefore recom|mend it to our Pantomime-writers, that in&s;tead
of the <PB N="282" REF="289"> <HI>Pantheon,</HI> or lewd comedies, they would
take their &s;ubjects from &s;ome Old Garland, Moral Ballad, or Penny Hi&s;tory
Book. Suppo&s;e, for example, they were to give us the &s;tory of <HI>Patient
Grizzle</HI> in dumb &s;hew; &s;etting forth, as how a noble lord fell in love
with her, as he was hunting;&mdash;and there you might have the &s;cene of the
Spinning Wheel, and the &s;ong of the <HI>Early Horn</HI>;&mdash;and as how,
after many tryals of her patience, which they might repre&s;ent by machi|nery,
this lord at la&s;t married her;&mdash;and then you may have a Grand Temple and
a Dance. The other hou&s;e have already revived the good old &s;tory of
<HI>Fortunatus</HI>'s Wi&s;hing-cap; and as they are fond of introducing little
children in their entertainments, &s;uppo&s;e they were to exhibit a Panto|mime
of the <HI>Three Children in the Wood:</HI>&mdash;'twould be va&s;tly pretty to
&s;ee the pa&s;te-board robin-red-brea&s;ts let down by wires upon the &s;tage,
to cover the poor innocent babes with paper leaves. But if they mu&s;t have
<HI>Fairies,</HI> and <HI>Genii,</HI> I would advi&s;e them to take their
&s;tories out of that pretty little book, called the <HI>Fairy Tales.</HI> I am
&s;ure, in&s;tead of o&s;triches, dogs, hor&s;es, lions, monkeys, &amp;c. we
&s;hould be full as well plea&s;ed to &s;ee the <HI>Wolf and little red
Riding-Hood</HI>; and we &s;hould laugh va&s;tly at the adventures of
<HI>Pu&s;s in Boots.</HI> I need not point out the excellent moral, which would
be inculcated by repre&s;entations of this kind; and I am confident they would
meet with the de&s;erved applau&s;e of all the old women and children in both
galleries.</P>

<P>_AT this &s;ea&s;on of the year it has always been cu&s;tomary
for the lower part of the world to expre&s;s their gratitude to their
benefactors; while &s;ome of a more elevated genius among them cloath their
thoughts in a kind of holiday dre&s;s, and once in the year ri&s;e into poets.
Thus the bellman bids good night to all his ma&s;ters and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es in
couplets; the news-carrier hawks his own ver&s;es; and the very lamp-lighter
addre&s;&s;es his worthy cu&s;tomers in rhyme. As a &s;ervant to the public, I
&s;hould be wanting in the due re&s;pect to my readers, if I al&s;o did not
take this earlie&s;t opportunity of paying them the compliments of the
&s;ea&s;on, and (in the phra&s;e of their barbers, taylors, &s;hoemakers, and
other trade&s;men) wi&s;h them a merry <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> and a happy New
Year.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="291">THOSE old-fa&s;hioned mortals who have
been accu&s;tomed to look upon this &s;ea&s;on with extraordinary devotion, I
leave to con over the explanation of it in <HI>Nel&s;on:</HI> It &s;hall at
pre&s;ent be my bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;hew the different methods of celebrating it
in the&s;e kingdoms. With the generality, <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> is looked upon
as a fe&s;tival in the mo&s;t literal &s;en&s;e, and held &s;acred by good
eating and drinking. The&s;e, in|deed, are the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing marks
of <HI>Chri&s;tmas:</HI> The revenue from the malt-tax and the duty upon wines,
&amp;c. on account of the&s;e twelve days, has always been found to encrea&s;e
con&s;iderably: And it is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive the &s;laughter that is
made among the poultry and the hogs in dif|ferent parts of the country, to
furni&s;h the prodigious numbers of turkeys and chines, and collars of brawn,
that travel up, as pre&s;ents, to the metropolis on this occa&s;ion. The jolly
cit looks upon this joyous time of fea&s;ting, with as much plea|&s;ure as on
the treat of a new-elected alderman, or a lord-mayor's day. Nor can the country
farmer rail more again&s;t the Game-Act, than many worthy citizens, who have
ever &s;ince been debarred of their annual hare; while their ladies can never
enough regret their lo&s;s of the opportunity of di&s;|playing their &s;kill,
in making a mo&s;t excellent pudding in the belly. But the&s;e notable
hou&s;e-wives have &s;till the con&s;olation of hearing their gue&s;ts commend
the mince-pies without meat, which we are a&s;&s;ured were made at home, and
not like the ordinary heavy things from the pa&s;try-cooks. The&s;e good people
would look upon the ab&s;ence of mince-pies as the highe&s;t violation of
<HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI>; and have remarked with concern the di&s;regard that has
been &s;hewn of late years to that Old <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> repa&s;t: For this
excellent <HI>Briti&s;h Ollio</HI> is as e&s;&s;ential to <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI>
as pancake to Shrove Tue&s;day, tan&s;y to Ea&s;ter, furmity to Midlent-Sunday,
or goo&s;e to Michaelmas Day. And they think it no wonder, 
<PB N="285" REF="292"> that our finical gentry &s;hould be &s;o loo&s;e in
their principles, as well as weak in their bodies, when the &s;olid,
&s;ub&s;tantial, Prote&s;tant mince-pie has given place among them to the Roman
Catholic <HI>Aumlets,</HI> and the light, puffy, heterodox <HI>Pets de
Religieu&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>AS this &s;ea&s;on u&s;ed formerly to be welcomed in with more
than u&s;ual jollity in the country, it is probable that the
<HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> remembrances, with which the waggons and &s;tage-coaches
are at this time loaded, fir&s;t took their ri&s;e from the laudable cu&s;tom
of di&s;tributing provi&s;ions at this &s;e|vere quarter of the year to the
poor. But the&s;e pre&s;ents are now &s;eldom &s;ent to tho&s;e who are really
in want of them, but are de&s;igned as compliments to the great from their
inferiors, and come chiefly from the tenant to his rich land-lord, or from the
rector of a fat living, as a kind of tythe, to his patron. Nor is the old
ho&s;pitable <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> cu&s;tom, of keeping open hou&s;e for the poor
neighbourhood, any longer regarded. We might as &s;oon expect to &s;ee
plumb-porridge fill a terrene at the ordinary at <HI>White</HI>'s, as that the
lord of the manour &s;hould a&s;&s;emble his poor tenants to make merry at the
great hou&s;e. The &s;ervants &s;will the <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> ale by
them&s;elves in the hall, while the &s;quire gets drunk with his brother
foxhunters in the &s;moking-room.</P>
<P>THERE is no rank of people &s;o heartily rejoiced at the arrival
of this joyful &s;ea&s;on, as the order of &s;ervants, journey|men, and
apprentices, and the lower &s;ort of people in gene|ral. No ma&s;ter or
mi&s;tre&s;s is &s;o rigid, as to refu&s;e them an holiday; and by remarkable
good luck the &s;ame circum|&s;tance, which gives them an opportunity of
diverting them|&s;elves, procures then money to &s;upport it, by the tax which
cu&s;tom has impo&s;ed upon us in the article of <HI>Chri&s;tmas-Boxes.</HI> 
<PB N="286" REF="293"> The butcher and the baker &s;end their journey-men and
apprentices to levy contributions on their cu&s;tomers, which are paid back
again in the u&s;ual fees to Mr. <HI>John</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Mary.</HI> This
&s;erves the trade&s;man as a pretence to lengthen out his bill, and the
ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s to lower the wages on account of the vails. The
<HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> Box was formerly the bounty of well-di&s;po&s;ed people,
who were willing to contribute &s;omething towards rewarding the
indu&s;|trious, and &s;upplying them with nece&s;&s;aries. But the gift is now
almo&s;t demanded as a right; and our journeymen, apprentices &amp;c. are grown
&s;o polite, that in&s;tead of re&s;erving their <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> Box for
its original u&s;e, their ready ca&s;h &s;erves them only for pre&s;ent
pocket-money; and in&s;tead of vi&s;iting their friends and relations, they
commence the fine gentlemen of the week. The &s;ixpenny hop is crouded with
ladies and gentlemen from the kitchen; the Syrens of <HI>Cathe|rine Street</HI>
charm many an holiday gallant into their &s;nares; and the play-hou&s;es are
filled with beaux, wits and critics, from <HI>Cheap&s;ide</HI> and
<HI>White-Chapel.</HI> The barrows are &s;ur|rounded with raw lads &s;etting
their halfpence again&s;t oranges; and the grea&s;y cards and dirty
cribbage-board employ the genteeler game&s;ters in every ale-hou&s;e. A merry
<HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> has ruined many a promi&s;ing young fellow, who has been
flu&s;h of money at the beginning of the week, but before the end of it has
committed a robbery on the till for more.</P>
<P>BUT in the mid&s;t of this general fe&s;tivity there are &s;ome
&s;o far from giving into any extraordinary merriment, that they &s;eem more
gloomy than u&s;ual, and appear with faces as di&s;mal as the month in which
<HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> is celebrated. I have heard a plodding citizen mo&s;t
grievou&s;ly complain of the great expence of hou&s;e-keeping at this
&s;ea&s;on, when his own and his wife's relations claim the privilege of
kin|dred <PB N="287" REF="294"> to eat him out of hou&s;e and home: Then again,
con&s;idering the pre&s;ent total decay of trade, and the great load of taxes,
it is a &s;hame that poor &s;hopkeepers &s;hould be &s;o fleeced and plundered,
under the pretence of <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> Boxes. But if trade&s;men have any
rea&s;on to murmur at <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> many of their cu&s;tomers, on the
other hand, tremble at its approach; as it is made a &s;anction to every petty
mechanic, to break in upon their joy, and di&s;turb a gentleman's repo&s;e at
this time, by bringing in his bill.</P>
<P>OTHERS, who u&s;ed to be very merry at this &s;ea&s;on, have
within this year or two been quite di&s;concerted. To put them out of their old
way, is to put them out of humour: they have therefore quarrelled with the
almanack, and re|fu&s;e to keep their <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> according to Act of
Parliament. My Cou&s;in VILLAGE informs me, that this ob&s;tinacy is very
common in the country; and that many &s;till per&s;i&s;t in waiting eleven days
for their mirth, and defer their <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> till the blowing of the
<HI>Gla&s;tonbury Thorn.</HI> In &s;ome, indeed, this cavilling with the
calendar has been only the re&s;ult of clo&s;e oeconomy; who by evading the
expence of keeping <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> with the re&s;t of the world, find
means to ne|glect it, when the general time of celebrating it is over. Many
have availed them&s;elves of this expedient: and I am acquainted with a couple,
who are enraged at the New Style on another account; becau&s;e it puts them to
double expences, by robbing them of the opportunity of keeping
<HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> Day and their Wedding Day at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>AS to per&s;ons of fa&s;hion, this annual Carnival is wor&s;e to
them than Lent, or the empty town in the middle of &s;um|mer. The boi&s;terous
merriment, and aukward affectation of politene&s;s among the vulgar, interrupts
the cour&s;e of their refined plea&s;ures, and drives them out of town for the
Holi|days. <PB N="288" REF="295"> The few who remain are very much at a lo&s;s
how to di&s;po&s;e of their time; for the theatres at this &s;ea&s;on are
opened only for the reception of &s;chool-boys and appren|tices, and there is
no public place where a per&s;on of fa&s;hion can appear, without being
&s;urrounded with the dirty inha|bitants of <HI>St. Giles</HI>'s, and the
brutes from the <HI>Wapping</HI> &s;ide of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter.</HI> The&s;e
unhappy &s;ufferers are really to be pitied; and &s;ince <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI>
day has to per&s;ons of di&s;tinc|tion a great deal of in&s;ipidity about it, I
cannot enough ap|plaud an ingenious lady, who &s;ent cards round to all her
acquaintance, inviting them to a route; which they de|clared was the happie&s;t
thought in the world, becau&s;e <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> Day is &s;o like
Sunday.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_CONTESTED Elections and Double Returns being at pre&s;ent the
general topic of di&s;|cour&s;e, a &s;ubject in which the ladies me|thinks are
but little concerned, I have a Scheme to propo&s;e to you in their behalf,
which I doubt not but you, as their profe&s;&s;ed patron, will u&s;e your
eloquence to recommend, and your authority to enforce. It has long been a
matter of real concern to <PB N="290" REF="297"> every well-wi&s;her to the
fair &s;ex, that the men &s;hould be allowed the free choice of
repre&s;entatives, to whom they can make every real or pretended grievance
known, while the women are deprived of the &s;ame privilege; when in reality
they have many grievances utterly unknown and unthought of by the men, and
which cannot be redre&s;&s;ed but by a FEMALE PARLIAMENT.</P>
<P>I DO not, indeed, pretend to the honour of fir&s;t pro|jecting
this Scheme, &s;ince an A&s;&s;embly of this nature has been propo&s;ed before:
but as it appears to me &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, I would advi&s;e that writs be
immediately i&s;&s;ued out for calling a Parliament of Women, which for the
future &s;hould a&s;&s;em|ble every winter, and be di&s;&s;olved every
<HI>third</HI> year. My rea|&s;on for &s;hortening the time of their &s;itting
proceeds from the reflection, that full as much bu&s;ine&s;s will be done, at
lea&s;t as many &s;peeches will be made, by women in three years, as by men in
&s;even. To this A&s;&s;embly every county and city in <HI>England</HI> &s;hall
&s;end two members; but from this privilege I would utterly exclude every
borough, as we &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;ee that they can have no bu&s;ine&s;s to
tran&s;act there. But as I would have their number at lea&s;t equal to that of
the other Parliament, the deficiency &s;hould be &s;up|plied by the &s;quares
and great &s;treets at the court end of the town, each of which &s;hould be
repre&s;ented by one of their own inhabitants. In humble imitation of the
Hou&s;es of Lords and Commons, the ladies of peers (whether &s;piri|tual or
temporal) &s;hould &s;it here in their own right, the others by election only;
any woman to be qualified, who&s;e hu&s;band, or even who&s;e father (for I
would by no means exclude the unmarried ladies) are qualified to be cho&s;en
into the other. In the &s;ame manner, whatever entitles the hu&s;|band or
father to vote at that election, &s;hould entitle his wife or daughter to vote
at this.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="298">HAVING &s;ettled this point, it now
remains to adju&s;t the &s;ubjects which they are to treat of; and the&s;e we
&s;hall find to be indeed of the la&s;t importance. What think you, Sir, of the
ri&s;e and fall of fa&s;hions, of as much con|&s;equence to them as the ri&s;e
and fall of kingdoms is to us? of the commencing a new acquaintance, equivalent
to our making a new alliance? and the ceremonial of a route or a ball, as
intere&s;ting as the preliminaries of a treaty or a congre&s;s? The&s;e
&s;ubjects, and the&s;e alone, will &s;ufficiently employ them every
&s;e&s;&s;ions; and as their judgment mu&s;t be final, how delightful will it
be to have bills brought in to determine how many inches of the leg or neck may
law|fully be expos'd, how many curte&s;ies at a public place amount to an
acquaintance, and what are the preci&s;e privileges of birth or fortune, that
entitle the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors to give routs or drums, on week-days or on
&s;undays. Whoever &s;hould pre|&s;ume to tran&s;gre&s;s again&s;t the&s;e
laws, might be puni&s;hed &s;uitably to their offences: and be bani&s;hed from
public places, or be condemned to do penance in lin&s;ey-wool&s;ey: or if any
female &s;hould be convicted of immode&s;ty, &s;he might be outlawed, and then
(as the&s;e laws would not bind the nymphs of <HI>Drury)</HI> we &s;hould
ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h a <HI>mode&s;t woman</HI> as the phra&s;e is, if not
by her looks, at lea&s;t by her dre&s;s and appearance, and the victorious
<HI>Fanny</HI> might then be &s;uffer'd to &s;trike bold &s;trokes without
rivalry or imitation. If any man too &s;hould be found &s;o gro&s;ly of|fending
again&s;t the laws of fa&s;hion as to refu&s;e a member a bow at a play or a
&s;alute at a wedding, how &s;uitably would he be puni&s;hed by being
reprimanded on his knees in &s;uch an a&s;&s;embly, and by &s;o fine a woman as
we may &s;uppo&s;e the &s;peaker would be? Then doubtle&s;s would a grand
committee &s;it on the affair of hoops; and were they e&s;tabli&s;hed in their
pre&s;ent form by proper authority, doors <PB N="292" REF="299"> and boxes
might be alter'd and enlarg'd accordingly. Then &s;hould we talk as familiarly
of the vi&s;it bill as of the mar|riage bill, and with what plea&s;ure &s;hould
we peru&s;e the regulations of the committee of dre&s;s? Every lover of
de|corum would be plea&s;ed to hear that refractory females were taken into
cu&s;tody by the u&s;her of the black fan: The double return of a vi&s;it would
occa&s;ion as many debates as the dou|ble return for a certain county, and at
the eve of an election how pretty would it be to &s;ee the ladies of the
&s;hire going about mounted on their white palfreys and canva&s;&s;ing for
votes.</P>
<P>TILL this great purpo&s;e is attain'd, I &s;ee not how the
vi&s;ible enormities in point of dre&s;s, and failures in point of ceremony can
effectually be prevented. But then, and not before, I &s;hall hope to &s;ee
politene&s;s and good breeding di|&s;tingui&s;hed from formality and
affectation, and dre&s;&s;es in|vented that will improve, not dimini&s;h the
charms of the fair, and rather become than di&s;gui&s;e the wearers.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, Sir, Yours, &amp;c. TIMOTHY
CANVAS.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>I AM much obliged to my corre&s;pondent for his letter, and
heartily wi&s;h that this Scheme was carried into execu|tion. The liberties
daily taken in point of dre&s;s demand proper re&s;trictions. The ancients
&s;ettled the national habit by law: but the dre&s;s of our own country is &s;o
very fluctua|ting, that if the great grandmothers of the pre&s;ent generation
were to ari&s;e, they would not be able to gue&s;s at their po&s;terity from
their dre&s;s, but would fancy them&s;elves in a &s;trange country. As the&s;e
affairs fall more immediately under the cognizance of the ladies, the female
world in general would &s;oon be &s;en&s;ible of the advantages accruing from a
female parliament: and tho' ladies of fa&s;hion might <PB N="293" REF="300">
probably claim &s;ome peculiar liberties in dre&s;s by their privilege, it
might naturally be expected that this wi&s;e a&s;&s;embly would at lea&s;t keep
the re&s;t of the &s;ex in order; nor &s;uffer enormous hoops to &s;pread
them&s;elves acro&s;s the whole pavement, to the detriment of all hone&s;t men
going upon bu&s;ine&s;s along the &s;treet; nor permit the chandler's wife to
retail half-quarterns from behind the counter, in a &s;hort &s;tomacher and
without an hankerchief.</P>
<P>I AM aware that a con&s;iderable objection may be brought
again&s;t this Scheme: to wit, that a Female Parliament (like tho&s;e of the
men) may be &s;ubject to corruption, and be made dependant on a court. The
enormous <HI>Eliza|beth</HI> Ruff, and the aukward Queen of <HI>Scots</HI> Mob,
are fatal in&s;tances of the evil influence which courts have upon fa&s;hions:
and as no one can tell the power which a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Queen might have
over the councils of a Female Parliament, future ages might perhaps &s;ee the
&s;tays bol&s;tered out into hump-backs, or the petticoats let down to conceal
a bandy leg, from the &s;ame &s;ervile complai&s;ance which warped the necks of
<HI>Alexander</HI>'s courtiers.</P>
<P>BUT though a Parliament on the foregoing &s;cheme has not yet
taken place, an in&s;titution of the like nature has been contrived among the
order of females, who (as I mentioned in a former paper) adverti&s;e for
gentlemen to <HI>play at cards</HI> with them. The reader may remember, that
&s;ome time ago an adverti&s;ement appeared in the public papers, from the
<HI>Covent-Garden</HI> Society; in which it was &s;et forth, that one of their
members was voted <HI>common.</HI> This very &s;ociety is compo&s;ed of the&s;e
Agreeable Young Ladies, whole bu&s;ine&s;s it is to <HI>play at cards</HI> with
tho&s;e gen|tlemen, who have good-nature and fortune &s;ufficient to &s;it down
contented with being lo&s;ers. It is divided, like the <PB N="294" REF="301">
upper and lower Hou&s;es of Parliament, into <HI>Ladies</HI> and
<HI>Commons.</HI> The upper order of <HI>Card-players</HI> take their &s;eats
according to the rank of tho&s;e who game at high &s;takes with them; while the
<HI>Commons</HI> are made up of the lower &s;ort of gamblers within the
hundreds of <HI>Drury</HI> and <HI>Covent-Garden.</HI> Every one is obliged to
pay a certain tax out of her <HI>Card-money</HI>; and the revenue ari&s;ing
from it is applied to the levying of hoop-petticoats, &s;acks, petenlairs,
caps, handkerchiefs, aprons, &amp;c. to be i&s;&s;ued out nightly according to
the exigence and degree of the members. Many revo|lutions have happened in this
&s;ociety &s;ince its in&s;titution: A <HI>Commoner</HI> in the &s;pace of a
few weeks has been called up to the Hou&s;e of Ladies; and another, who at
fir&s;t &s;at as Peere&s;s, has been &s;uddenly degraded, and voted
<HI>common.</HI></P>
<P>MORE particulars of this Society have not come to my knowledge:
but their de&s;ign &s;eems to be, to erect a Com|mon Wealth of them&s;elves,
and to re&s;cue their liberties from being invaded by tho&s;e who have
pre&s;umed to tyrannize over them. If this practice of playing their own cards,
and &s;huff|ling for them&s;elves, &s;hould generally prevail among all the
Agreeable Young Game&s;ters of <HI>Covent-Garden,</HI> I am con|cerned to think
what will become of the venerable &s;i&s;terhood of <HI>Dougla&s;s,
Haddocks,</HI> and <HI>Noble,</HI> as well as the fraternity of <HI>Harris,
Derry,</HI> and the re&s;t of tho&s;e gentlemen, who have hitherto acted as
Groom-Porters, and had the principal di|rection of the game. From &s;uch a
combination it may greatly be feared, that the honourable profe&s;&s;ion of
Pimp will in a &s;hort time become as u&s;ele&s;s as that of a
Fleet-Par&s;on.</P>

<P>_THE la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ions deprived us of the only &s;urviving
member of a Society, which (dur|ing its &s;hort exi&s;tence) was equal both in
principles and practice to the <HI>Mohocks</HI> and <HI>Hell Fire Club</HI> of
tremendous memory. This Society was compo&s;ed of a few broken game&s;ters and
de&s;|perate young rakes, who threw the &s;mall remains of their bankrupt
fortunes into one common &s;tock, and thence a&s;|&s;umed the name of the
La&s;t Guinea Club. A &s;hort life and a merry one was their favourite maxim;
and they de|termined, when their finances &s;hould be quite exhau&s;ted, to die
as they had lived, like gentlemen. Some of their <PB N="296" REF="303"> members
had the good luck to get a reprieve by a good run at cards, and others by
&s;napping up a rich heire&s;s or a dowager; while the re&s;t, who were not cut
off in the natural way by duels or the gallows, very re&s;olutely made their
<HI>quietus</HI> with laudanum or the pi&s;tol. The la&s;t that remained of
this Society had very calmly prepared for his own execution: he had cocked his
pi&s;tol, deliberately placed the muzzle of it to his temple, and was ju&s;t
going to pull the trigger, when he bethought him&s;elf that he could employ it
to better purpo&s;e upon <HI>Houn&s;low Heath.</HI> This brave man, however,
had but a very &s;hort re&s;pite, and was obliged to &s;uffer the ignominy of
going out of the world in the vulgar way by a halter.</P>
<P>THE enemies of play will perhaps con&s;ider tho&s;e gentle|men,
who boldly &s;take their whole fortunes at the gaming-table, in the &s;ame view
with the&s;e de&s;peradoes; and they may even go &s;o far as to regard the
polite and honourable a&s;&s;embly at <HI>White</HI>'s as a kind of La&s;t
Guinea Club. No|thing, they will &s;ay, is &s;o fluctuating as the property of
a game&s;ter, who (when luck runs again&s;t him) throws away whole acres at
every ca&s;t of the dice, and who&s;e hou&s;es are as un&s;ure a
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, as if they were built with cards. Many, indeed, have been
reduced to their la&s;t guinea at this gen|teel gaming-hou&s;e: but the mo&s;t
inveterate enemies to <HI>White</HI>'s mu&s;t allow, that it is but now and
then, that a game&s;ter of quality, who looks upon it as a to&s;s-up whether
there is another world, takes his chance, and di&s;patches him|&s;elf, when the
odds are again&s;t him in this.</P>
<P>BUT however free the gentlemen of <HI>White</HI>'s may be from
any imputation of this kind, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that Suicide begins to
prevail &s;o generally, that it is the mo&s;t gallant exploit, by which our
modern heroes chu&s;e to &s;ignalize them&s;elves; and in this, indeed, they
behave with uncommon prowe&s;s. From the days of <HI>Plato</HI> down to 
<PB N="297" REF="304"> the&s;e a Suicide has always been compared to a
&s;oldier on guard de&s;erting his po&s;t; but I &s;hould rather con&s;ider a
&s;et of the&s;e de&s;perate men, who ru&s;h on certain death, as a body of
troops &s;ent out on the Forlorn Hope. They meet every face of death, however
horrible, with the utmo&s;t re&s;olution: &s;ome blow their brains out with a
pi&s;tol; &s;ome expire like <HI>Socrates,</HI> by poi&s;ons; &s;ome fall, like
<HI>Cato,</HI> on the point of their own &s;words; and others, who have lived
like <HI>Nero,</HI> affect to die like <HI>Seneca,</HI> and bleed to death. The
mo&s;t exalted geniu&s;&s;es I ever remember to have heard of, were a party of
reduced game&s;ters, who bravely re&s;olved to pledge each other in a bowl of
laudanum. I was al&s;o lately informed of a gentleman, who went among his
u&s;ual companions at the gaming-table the day before he made away with
him&s;elf, and coolly que&s;tioned them, which they thought the ea&s;ie&s;t and
genteele&s;t method of going out of the world: for there is as much difference
between a mean per&s;on and a man of quality in their manner of de|&s;troying
them&s;elves, as in their manner of living. The poor &s;neaking wretch,
&s;tarving in a garret, tucks him&s;elf up in his li&s;t garters; a &s;econd,
cro&s;t in love, drowns him&s;elf, like a blind puppy, in <HI>Ro&s;amond's
Pond;</HI> and a third cuts his throat with his own razor. But the man of
fa&s;hion al|mo&s;t always dies by a pi&s;tol; and even the cobler of any
&s;pirit goes off by a do&s;e or two extraordinary of gin.</P>
<P>BUT this fal&s;e &s;pirit of courage, however noble it may
appear to the de&s;perate and abandoned, in reality amounts to no more than the
re&s;olution of the highwayman, who &s;hoots him&s;elf with his own pi&s;tol,
when he finds it impo&s;&s;ible to avoid being taken. All po&s;&s;ible means
therefore &s;hould be devi&s;ed to extirpate &s;uch ab&s;urd bravery, and to
make it appear every way horrible, odious, contemptible, and ridi|culous. From
reading the public prints a foreigner might be naturally led to imagine, that
we are the mo&s;t lunatic <PB N="298" REF="305"> people in the whole world.
Almo&s;t every day informs us, that the coroner's inque&s;t has &s;at on the
body of &s;ome mi&s;e|rable Suicide, and brought in their verdict
<HI>Lunacy</HI>; but it is very well known that the inquiry has not been made
into the &s;tate of mind of the decea&s;ed, but into his fortune and family.
The law has indeed provided, that the deliberate Self-Murderer &s;hould be
treated like a brute, and denied the rites of burial: but among hundreds of
<HI>lunatics by purcha&s;e,</HI> I never knew this &s;entence executed but on
one poor cobler who hanged him&s;elf in his own &s;tall. A pennyle&s;s poor dog
who has not left enough to defray the funeral charges, may perhaps be excluded
the church-yard; but Self-murder by a pi&s;tol genteely mounted, or the
<HI>Paris</HI>-hilted &s;word qualifies the polite owner for a <HI>&s;udden
death,</HI> and entitles him to a pom|pous burial, and a monument &s;etting
forth his virtues in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey.</HI> Every man in his &s;ober
&s;en&s;es mu&s;t wi&s;h that the mo&s;t &s;evere laws that could po&s;&s;ibly
be contrived were enacted again&s;t Suicides. This &s;hocking bravado never did
(and I am confident never will) prevail among the more deli|cate and tender
&s;ex in our own nation: tho' hi&s;tory informs us that the <HI>Roman</HI>
Ladies were once &s;o infatuated as to throw off the &s;oftne&s;s of their
nature, and commit violence on them|&s;elves, 'till the madne&s;s was curbed by
expo&s;ing their naked bodies in the public &s;treets. This, I think, would
afford a hint for fixing the like marks of ignominy on our Male-Suicides, and I
would have every lower wretch of this &s;ort dragged at the cart's tail, and
afterwards be hung in chains at his own door, or have his quarters put up
<HI>in terrorem</HI> in the mo&s;t public places as a rebel to his Maker. But
that the Suicide of quality might be treated with more re&s;pect, he &s;hould
be indulged in having his wounded corp&s;e and &s;hat|tered brains lay (as it
were) in &s;tate for &s;ome days, of which dreadful &s;pectacle we may conceive
the horror from the fol|lowing picture drawn by <HI>Dryden.</HI> 
<Q> 
<L>The SLAYER OF HIMSELF too &s;aw I there:</L> 
<L>The gore congealed was clotted in his hair:</L> 
<L>With eyes half-clo&s;ed, and mouth wide ope he lay,</L> 
<L>And grim as when he breathed his &s;ullen &s;oul away.</L> 
<BIBL>DRYDEN's FABLES.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="306">THE common murderer has his &s;keleton
pre&s;erved at <HI>Surgeon's Hall</HI> in order to deter others from being
guilty of his crimes; and I think it would not be improper to have a
charnel-hou&s;e &s;et apart to receive the bones of the&s;e more unnatural
Self-Murderers, in which monuments &s;hould be erected giving an account of
their deaths, and adorned with the glorious en&s;igns of their ra&s;hne&s;s,
the rope, the knife, the &s;word, or the pi&s;tol.</P>
<P>THE cau&s;e of the&s;e frequent &s;elf-murders among us has been
generally imputed to the peculiar temperature of our climate. Thus a dull day
is looked upon as a natural order of execution, and <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI>
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;hoot, hang, and drown them&s;elves in
<HI>November.</HI> That our &s;pirits are in &s;ome mea&s;ure influenced by the
air cannot be denied, but we are not &s;uch meer Barometers as to be driven to
de&s;|pair and death by the &s;mall degree of gloom that our winter brings with
it. If we have not &s;o much &s;un&s;hine as &s;ome countries in the world, we
have infinitely more than many others, and I do not hear that men di&s;patch
them&s;elves by dozens in <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> or <HI>Sweden,</HI> or that they
are unable to keep up their &s;pirits even in the total darkne&s;s of
<HI>Greenland.</HI> Our climate exempts us from many di&s;ea&s;es to which
other more &s;outhern nations are naturally &s;ubject, and I can never be
per&s;uaded that being born near the North-pole is a phy&s;ical cau&s;e for
Self-Murder.</P>
<P>DESPAIR indeed is the natural cau&s;e of the&s;e &s;hocking
actions; but this is commonly de&s;pair brought on by wilful extravagance and
debauchery. The&s;e fir&s;t involve men in difficulties, and then death at once
delivers them of their lives and their cares. For my part, when I &s;ee a young
profligate wantonly &s;quandering his fortune in bagnios or at the
gaming-table, I cannot help looking on him as ha&s;tening his own death, and in
a manner digging his own grave. As he is at la&s;t induced to kill him&s;elf by
motives ari&s;ing from his vices, I con&s;ider him as dying of &s;ome
di&s;ea&s;e, which tho&s;e vices naturally produce. If his extravagance has
been chiefly in luxurious eating and drinking, I imagine him poi&s;oned by his
wines, or &s;urfeited by a favourite di&s;h; and if he has thrown away his
e&s;tate in bawdy-hou&s;es, I conclude him de&s;troyed by rottenne&s;s and
filthy di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="307">ANOTHER principal cau&s;e of the frequency
of Suicide is the noble &s;pirit of Freethinking which has diffu&s;ed it&s;elf
among all ranks of people. The libertine of fa&s;hion has too refined a ta&s;te
to trouble him&s;elf at all about a &s;oul or an hereafter: but the vulgar
infidel is at wonderful pains to get rid of his bible, and labours to
per&s;uade him&s;elf out of his religion. For this purpo&s;e he attends
con&s;tantly at the di&s;|putant &s;ocieties, where he hears a great deal about
free will, free agency, and prede&s;tination, 'till at length he is convinced
that man is at liberty to do as he plea&s;es, lays his misfortunes to the
charge of providence, and comforts him&s;elf that he was inevitably de&s;tined
to be tyed up in his own garters. The courage of the&s;e heroes proceeds from
the &s;ame principles whether they fall by their own hands, or tho&s;e of
<HI>Jack Ketch:</HI> The Suicide of whatever rank looks death in the face
with|out &s;hrinking; as the gallant rogue affects an ea&s;y unconcern under
<HI>Tyburn,</HI> throws away the p&s;alm-book, bids the cart drive off with an
oath, and &s;wings like a gentleman.</P>
<P>IF this madne&s;s &s;hould continue to grow more and more
epidemical, it will be expedient to have a Bill of Suicide, di&s;tinct from the
common bill of mortality, brought in yearly, in which &s;hould be &s;et down
the number of Suicides, their methods of de&s;troying them&s;elves, and the
likely cau&s;es of their doing &s;o. In this, I believe, we &s;hould find but
few martyrs to the weather, but their deaths would commonly be imputed to
de&s;pair, produced by &s;ome cau&s;es &s;imilar to the following. In the
little &s;ketch of a Bill of Suicide under|neath, I have left blanks for the
date of the year, as well as for the number of Self-Murderers, their manner of
dying, &amp;c. which would naturally be filled up by the proper per&s;ons if
ever this &s;cheme &s;hould be put in execution.</P>

<P>_SINCE plea&s;ure is almo&s;t the only pur&s;uit of a fine
gentleman, it is very nece&s;&s;ary, for the maintaining his con&s;equence and
cha|racter, that he &s;hould have a girl in keep|ing. Intriguing with women of
fa&s;hion, and debauching trade&s;men's daughters, naturally happen in the
common cour&s;e of gallantry; but this convenient fe|male, to fill up the
intervals of bu&s;ine&s;s, is the principal mark of his &s;uperior ta&s;te and
quality. Every priggi&s;h clerk to an attorney, or pert apprentice can throw
away his occa|&s;ional guinea in <HI>Covent-Garden</HI>; but the &s;hortne&s;s
of their <PB N="302" REF="309"> finances will not permit them to per&s;evere in
debauchery with the air and &s;pirit of a man of quality. The Kept
Mi|&s;tre&s;s (which tho&s;e half-reprobates dare not think of) is a con&s;tant
part of the retinue of a complete fine gentleman, and is, indeed, as
indi&s;pen&s;ible a part of his equipage, as a <HI>French valet de chambre</HI>
or a four-wheeled po&s;t-chai&s;e.</P>
<P>IT was formerly the fa&s;hion among the ladies to keep a monkey:
At that time every woman of quality thought her&s;elf obliged to follow the
mode; and even the merchants wives in the city had their fa&s;hionable pugs to
play tricks and break china. A Girl in Keeping is as di&s;agreeable to &s;ome
of our men of plea&s;ure, as pug was to &s;ome ladies; but they mu&s;t have one
to &s;pend money and do mi&s;chief, that they may be reckoned young fellows of
&s;pirit. Hence it happens, that many gentlemen maintain girls, who in fact are
little more than their nominal mi&s;tre&s;&s;es; for they &s;ee them as
&s;eldom, and behave to them with as much indif|ference as if they were their
wives: however, as the woman in a manner bears their name, and is maintained by
them, they may appear in the world with the genteel character of a Keeper. I
have known &s;everal gentlemen take great pains to heighten their reputation in
this way; and turn off a fir&s;t mi&s;tre&s;s, merely becau&s;e &s;he was not
&s;ufficiently known, for the &s;ake of a celebrated woman of the town, a
dancer, or an actre&s;s: and it is always the fir&s;t &s;tep of an
<HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> of fa&s;hion after his arrival at <HI>Paris,</HI> to take
one of the <HI>Filles d' Opera</HI> under his protection. It was but the other
day, that <HI>Florio</HI> went abroad, and left his girl to roll about the town
in a chariot, with an unlimited order on his banker; and almo&s;t as &s;oon as
he got to <HI>France,</HI> took a &s;mart girl off the &s;tage, to make as
genteel a figure at <HI>Paris.</HI> In &s;hort, as a gentleman keeps running
hor&s;es, goes to <HI>White</HI>'s, and gets into parliament, for the name of
the <PB N="303" REF="310"> thing; &s;o mu&s;t he likewi&s;e have his Kept
Mi&s;tre&s;s, becau&s;e it is the fa&s;hion: and I was mightily plea&s;ed with
hearing a gentleman once boa&s;t, that he lived like a man of
quality&mdash;For, &s;ays he, I have a po&s;t-chai&s;e and never ride in it, I
have a wife and never &s;ee her, and I keep a mi&s;tre&s;s and never lie with
her.</P>
<P>BUT if the&s;e &s;ort of Keepers, who never care a farthing for
their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, are to be laughed at, tho&s;e who are really fond of
their <HI>Dulcineas</HI> are to be pitied. The mo&s;t hen-pecked hu&s;band,
that ever bore the grievous yoke of a &s;hrew, is not half &s;o mi&s;erable, as
a man who is &s;ubject to the humours and unaccountable caprice of a cunning
&s;lut, who finds him in her power. Her behaviour will continu|ally give him
new occa&s;ion of jealou&s;y; and perhaps &s;he will really di&s;pen&s;e her
favours to every rake in town, that will bid up to her price. She will &s;mile
when &s;he wants money, be in&s;olent when &s;he does not, and in &s;hort leave
no artifice untried, to plague his heart, and drain his pocket. A friend of
mine u&s;ed con&s;tantly to rail at the &s;lavi&s;h condi|tion of married men,
and the tyranny of petticoat-government: he therefore prudently re&s;olved to
live an uncontrouled batchelor, and for this rea&s;on pitched upon a country
girl, who &s;hould &s;erve him as an handmaid. Determining to keep her in a
very &s;nug and retired manner, he had even calcu|lated how much &s;he would
&s;ave him in curtailing his ordinary expences at taverns and bagnios: but this
&s;cheme of oeconomy did not la&s;t long; for the artful jade &s;oon contrived 
<Q REND="inline">"to wind her clo&s;e into his ea&s;y heart,"</Q>
and inveigled him to maintain her in all the &s;plendor and <HI>eclat</HI> of a
fir&s;t rate lady of plea&s;ure. He at fir&s;t treated her with all the
indifference of a fa&s;hionable hu&s;band; but as &s;oon as &s;he found
her&s;elf to be entire mi&s;tre&s;s of his affections, it is &s;urpri&s;ing to
think what pains &s;he took, to bring him to the mo&s;t abject compliance 
<PB N="304" REF="311"> with all her whim&s;ies, and to tame him to the patient
thing he now is. A frown on his part would frequently co&s;t him a brocade, and
a tear from her was &s;ure to extort a new hand|kerchief or an apron. Upon any
&s;light quarrel&mdash;O &s;he would leave him that moment;&mdash;and though
the baggage had more cunning than to hazard an intrigue with any one el&s;e,
&s;he would work upon his jealou&s;y by continually twit|ting him
with&mdash;She knew a gentleman, who would &s;corn to u&s;e her &s;o
barbarou&s;ly,&mdash;and &s;he would go to him, if &s;he could be &s;ure &s;he
was not with child.&mdash;This la&s;t circum|&s;tance was a <HI>coup de
re&s;erve,</HI> which never failed to bring about a reconciliation: nay, I have
known her make great u&s;e of breeding qualms upon occa&s;ion; and things were
once come to &s;uch an extremity, that &s;he was even forced to have recour&s;e
to a &s;ham mi&s;carriage to prevent their &s;eparation. He has been often
heard to declare, that if he ever had a child by her, it &s;hould take its
chance at the <HI>Foundling Ho&s;|pital.</HI> He had lately an opportunity of
putting this to a trial: but the bare hinting of &s;uch a barbarous de&s;ign
threw the lady into hy&s;terics. However, he was determined, that the babe, as
&s;oon as it was born, &s;hould be put out to nur&s;e,&mdash;he hated the
&s;quall of children. Well! madam was brought to bed: &s;he could not bear the
dear infant out of her &s;ight; and it would kill her not to &s;uckle it
her&s;elf. The father was therefore obliged to comply; and an acquaintance
caught him the other morning, &s;tirring the pap, holding the clouts before the
fire, (and in a word) dwindled into a mere nur&s;e. Such is the transformation
of this <HI>Kind Keeper,</HI> who&s;e character is &s;till more ridiculous than
that of a <HI>Fondle-wife</HI> among hu&s;bands. The amours, indeed, of the&s;e
fond &s;ouls commonly end one of the&s;e two ways: they either find
them&s;elves de&s;erted by their mi&s;tre&s;s, when &s;he has effectu|ally
ruined their con&s;titution and e&s;tate; or after as many years cohabitation,
as would have tired them of a wife, they <PB N="305" REF="312"> grow &s;o
doatingly fond of their whore, that by marriage they make her an hone&s;t
woman, and perhaps a lady of quality.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t unpardonable &s;ort of Keepers are Married Men, and
Old Men. I will give the reader a &s;hort &s;ketch of each of the&s;e
characters, and leave him to judge for him|&s;elf. <HI>Cynthio</HI> about two
years ago was married to <HI>Clarinda,</HI> one of the fine&s;t women in the
world. Her temper and di&s;|po&s;ition was as agreeable as her per&s;on, and
her chief endea|vour was to plea&s;e her hu&s;band. But <HI>Cynthio</HI>'s
folly and va|nity &s;oon got the better of his con&s;tancy and gratitude, and
it was not &s;ix months after his marriage, before he took a girl he was
formerly acquainted with into keeping. His dear <HI>Polly</HI> u&s;es him like
a dog, and he is cruel enough to revenge the ill-treatment he receives from her
upon his wife. He &s;eldom vi&s;its her, but when his wench has put him out of
humour, and once, though indeed unknowingly, communi|cated to her a filthy
di&s;ea&s;e, for which he was obliged to his mi&s;tre&s;s. Yet is he &s;till
&s;o infatuated as to doat on this vile hu&s;&s;y, and wi&s;hes it in his power
to annul his marriage, and legitimate his ba&s;tards by <HI>Polly.</HI> Yet is
it palpable to every one but <HI>Cynthio,</HI> that <HI>Polly</HI> has no
attraction but the name of Mi&s;tre&s;s, and <HI>Clarinda</HI> no fault but
being his wife.&mdash;Sir <HI>Thrifty Gripe</HI> is arrived at his Grand
Climac|teric, and has ju&s;t taken a girl into keeping. Till very lately the
multiplication-table was his rule of life, and 
<Q REND="inline">"a penny &s;aved is a penny got"</Q> was his
favourite maxim. But he has &s;uddenly de&s;erted <HI>Wingate</HI> for
<HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> and the <HI>Change</HI> for <HI>Covent-Garden.</HI> Here
he met with the buxom <HI>Charlotte,</HI> who at once opened his heart and his
pur&s;e, and &s;oon begun to &s;catter his guineas in paying her debts, and
&s;upply|ing her fre&s;h expences. Her equipage is as genteel and ele|gant as
that of a dutche&s;s, and the wi&s;e men in the alley &s;hake their heads at
Sir <HI>Thrifty</HI> as the greate&s;t &s;pendthrift in town. Sir
<HI>Thrifty</HI> was formerly married to a merchant's daughter who brought him
a fortune of 20,000 l. but after &s;he had two &s;ons by him, he &s;ent her
into the North of <HI>Wales</HI> to live cheap, and prevent the probable
expence of more children. His &s;ons were obliged to an uncle for education, 
<PB N="306" REF="313"> and Sir <HI>Thrifty</HI> now &s;carce allows them enough
to &s;upport them. His mi&s;tre&s;s and he almo&s;t always appear together at
public places, where &s;he con&s;tantly makes a je&s;t of him, while the old
dotard dangles at her elbow, like <HI>January</HI> by the &s;ide of
<HI>May.</HI> Thus Sir <HI>Thrifty</HI> lives, cur&s;ed by his own &s;ons,
jilted by his mi&s;tre&s;s, and laughed at by the re&s;t of the world.</P>
<P>IT is very diverting to ob&s;erve the &s;hifts to which
per&s;ons in middling or low life are reduced, in order to bear this new
incumbrance with which they &s;ometimes chu&s;e to load them|&s;elves. The
extravagances of a girl has put many a clerk on defrauding his ma&s;ter, &s;ent
many a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed gentleman's watch to the pawnbroker's, and his cloaths
to <HI>Monmouth Street,</HI> as well as the poor gentleman him&s;elf to the
gaming-table, or perhaps to <HI>Houn&s;low Heath.</HI> I know a templar who
always keeps a girl for the fir&s;t month after he receives his allowance, when
his poverty obliges him to di&s;card her, and live on mutton-chops and porter
for the re&s;t of the quarter: and it was but lately that my mercer
di&s;covered his appren|tice to be concerned with two others in an
a&s;&s;ociation for maintaining one trull common to the whole three.</P>
<P>THIS review of one of the chief &s;ources of extravagance in the
higher and middling walks of life will help us in ac|counting for the frequent
mortgages and di&s;tre&s;&s;es in families of fa&s;hion, and the numerous
bankruptcies in trade. Here al&s;o I cannot help ob&s;erving that in this
ca&s;e the mi&s;behaviour of the women is in great mea&s;ure to be charged to
the men; for how can it be expected that a lady &s;hould take any plea|&s;ure
in di&s;charging the dome&s;tic duties of a wife, when &s;he &s;ees her
hu&s;band's affections placed abroad. Nothing indeed can be advanced in
vindication of loo&s;e conduct in the fair &s;ex, but, con&s;idering our modern
morals, it is &s;urely not much to be wondered at, when the hu&s;band openly
affronts his family by keeping a wench, if the wife al&s;o takes care to
provide her&s;elf a gallant.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ROCKS, de&s;arts, wilds, wa&s;tes, &s;avages, and barba|rians
make up the &s;um total of the odious country: I am ju&s;t returned from a
vi&s;it there, and would not <PB N="308" REF="315"> pa&s;s another three weeks
in the &s;ame way to be lord of the manor.</P>
<P>HAVING received frequent invitations from Sir <HI>Samp&s;on
Fivebars,</HI> and having heard much of the beauty of his three &s;i&s;ters, in
an evil hour I took a re&s;olution to &s;acrifice this <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> to
him at his &s;eat in <HI>Wilt&s;hire.</HI> I flattered my&s;elf with the hopes
that the novelty and oddne&s;s of the &s;cene would &s;erve me at lea&s;t to
laugh at, and that if the ru&s;tics were not mere &s;tocks and &s;tones, my
cloaths and di&s;cour&s;e would have taught them to talk and dre&s;s like human
crea|tures. Need I tell you that I was di&s;appointed? Sir <HI>Samp&s;on</HI>
is what the country people call a hearty man. He has the &s;hape and
con&s;titution of a porter, and is &s;turdy enough to encounter
<HI>Broughton</HI> without mufflers; 
<Q REND="inline">"when he &s;peaks, thunder breaks;"</Q> he
hunts almo&s;t every morning, and takes a toa&s;t and tankard for his
breakfa&s;t. You may ea&s;ily imagine, that what was plea&s;ure to him mu&s;t
be torture to me; and indeed I would as &s;oon draw in a mill, or carry a chair
for my diver&s;ion, as follow any of their horrid country amu&s;ements. But Sir
<HI>Samp&s;on</HI> out of his abundant good-nature in&s;i&s;ted on lending me a
gun, and &s;howing me a day's &s;port of &s;hooting. For this purpo&s;e he
loaded me with a huge gun, threw a bag and pouch acro&s;s my &s;houlders, and
made me look for all the world like <HI>Robin&s;on Cru&s;oe.</HI> After I had
followed him over three or four ploughed fields, a &s;ervant, who was with us,
hollowed out, <HI>Mark!</HI> when the Baronet's gun went off &s;o &s;uddenly
that it threw me into a &s;woon, and at la&s;t I could hardly be convinced that
Sir <HI>Samp&s;on</HI> had &s;hot nothing but a partridge.</P>
<P>AFTER this you will conclude that I was not to be pre|vailed
on to hunt. Once indeed Mi&s;s <HI>Fanny</HI> did tempt me to accompany her on
a morning-ride, but even of this I <PB N="309" REF="316"> heartily repented.
Mi&s;s <HI>Fanny,</HI> I found, valued neither hedge nor ditch, has the
&s;trength of a chair-woman, and in &s;hort is more like <HI>Trulla</HI> in
<HI>Hudibras,</HI> or <HI>Boadicia</HI> in the play, than a woman of fa&s;hion.
Unluckily too the hor&s;e I rode was &s;kitti&s;h and unruly; &s;o that while I
was &s;campering after Mi&s;s <HI>Fanny</HI> a &s;udden &s;tart brought me to
the ground. I received no hurt, but the fall &s;o fluttered my &s;pirits, that
Mi&s;s <HI>Fanny</HI> was obliged to take me up behind her. When we arrived at
the hou&s;e I was in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion, for the booby &s;ervants &s;tood
gaping and grinning at my di&s;tre&s;s, and Sir <HI>Samp&s;on</HI> him&s;elf
told me, with a laugh as horrible as <HI>Caliban</HI>'s, that he would lend me
one of his maids to carry me out airing every morning.</P>
<P>BESIDES the&s;e and fifty other mortifications I could
&s;carce get any re&s;t during the whole time I remained there: every other
morning I was con&s;tantly waked by the hungry knight, ju&s;t returned from the
chace and bawling for dinner. My breakfa&s;t was what they called their
afternoon tea, at which I always a&s;&s;i&s;ted the ladies, for I &s;hould
infallibly have peri&s;hed had I &s;tayed in the hall amid&s;t the jargon of
toa&s;ts and the fumes of tobacco. I thought indeed my time might be much more
agreeably employed in the parlour; but even here my di&s;appointment was
grievous pa&s;t expre&s;|&s;ion. The&s;e fair ones, for &s;uch they were, were
hale indeed and ruddy, and having been always cooped up, like turkeys in a pen,
were really no better than <HI>belles &s;auvages,</HI> being totally ignorant
of the fa&s;hionable arts and langui&s;hing <HI>deli|cate&s;&s;e</HI> of women
of fa&s;hion. Their cloaths were huddled on merely with a view to cover their
nakedne&s;s, and they had no notion that their eyes were given them for any
other purpo&s;e than to &s;ee, and what is more &s;trange, to read, for&s;ooth!
For my part, Mr. TOWN, unle&s;s a woman can u&s;e her eyes to more advantage, I
&s;hould as &s;oon fall in <PB N="310" REF="317"> love with my lap dog or my
monkey; and what con&s;titutes the difference between a lady and her cookmaid
but her ta&s;te in dre&s;s? Mobs and handkerchiefs an&s;wer the end of
covering, but the main purpo&s;e of dre&s;s is to reveal. I really almo&s;t
begin to think that the&s;e awkard creatures were &s;o &s;tupid and
unaccountable as to have no de&s;ign upon me. To complete the oddity of their
characters, the&s;e girls are con&s;tant at church, but never dreamt of
promoting an intrigue there; employ their whole time there in praying, never
heard of &s;uch things as cut fans, and are &s;o attentive to the queer old put
of a preacher that they &s;carce look or li&s;ten to any one el&s;e. After
&s;ervice too the doctor is always taken home to dinner, and is as con&s;tant
at table on Sunday as a roa&s;t &s;irloin and a plumb pudding.</P>
<P>BUT even with the&s;e unaccountable females, I thought I could
have pa&s;&s;ed my evenings tolerably if I could have got them to cards, which
have the charming faculty of rendering all women equally agreeable. But
the&s;e, I found, they were almo&s;t wholly unaccu&s;tomed to. I once indeed
heard the dear cards mentioned, and was in hopes of &s;ome|thing like an
a&s;&s;embly. But what was my mortification! when in&s;tead of &s;eeing half a
dozen card-tables &amp;c. &s;et out, and Whi&s;t, Brag, or Lan&s;quenet going
forward, I &s;aw the&s;e &s;trange women place them&s;elves at a huge round
table with country girls and cherry-cheeked bumkins to play, according to
annual <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> cu&s;tom, at Pope Joan and
Snip-&s;nap-&s;norum.</P>
<P>IT would be endle&s;s to recount the mi&s;eries I &s;uffered
in tho&s;e three weeks. Even the nece&s;&s;aries of life were denied me, and I
could &s;carce have been more at a lo&s;s among the <HI>Hottentots.</HI> Would
you think it, Sir? tho' this hou&s;e had a family in it, and a family of
females too, not a drop of <PB N="311" REF="318"> <HI>Benjamin</HI>-wa&s;h, nor
a du&s;t of almond powder could be pro|cured there, nor indeed in all the
pari&s;h; and I was forced to &s;crub my hands with filthy wa&s;h-ball, which
&s;o ruined their complexion that laying in gloves will not recover them this
fortnight. Add to this that I never could dre&s;s for want of pomatum, &s;o
that my hair was always in di&s;hevelle, and I am &s;ure I &s;hould not have
been known at the <HI>Dilettant&igrave;.</HI> At length, Sir! my &s;nuff and
&s;alts were pretty nigh ex|hau&s;ted; and to add to my di&s;tre&s;s, I lo&s;t
my &s;nuff-box. The&s;e lo&s;&s;es, were irreparable there; not all the country
afforded &s;uch &s;nuff and &s;alts as mine, I could as &s;oon live without
food as without either, and not a box could I touch but one of
<HI>Deard</HI>'s, and of my own chu&s;ing. So I hurried up to town, and being
ju&s;t recovered from the fatigue of my journey I &s;end you this, in hopes
that my woeful experience will deter all my friends from following a cha&s;e as
mad and hare-brained as any of Sir <HI>Samp&s;on</HI>'s; &s;ince it is
impo&s;&s;ible to exi&s;t a day there with tolerable ea&s;e, and neither wit
nor beauty are worth one pinch unle&s;s they are improved by a <HI>Town
Education.</HI></P>

<P>DID I know your chri&s;tian name I would call you by it, to
&s;how you at fir&s;t &s;etting out that I know the world, and was born and
bred in high life.</P>
<P>THE de&s;ign of this epi&s;tle is to expre&s;s to you the
unea&s;i|ne&s;s that &s;ome of us women of &s;pirit feel at being incum|bered
with petticoats, and to convince you by our way of life that had we been men we
&s;hould have been Bucks of the Fir&s;t Head. Be a&s;&s;ured however that
&s;uch of us as are <PB N="312" REF="319"> unmarried are &s;trictly virtuous.
We have indeed been accu|&s;ed of copying the dre&s;s of the nymphs of
<HI>Drury.</HI> And can any thing be invented more becoming? <HI>Fanny,</HI> it
mu&s;t be owned has Ta&s;te. What &s;o &s;mart as a cocked hat? and who but
&s;ee's the advantages of &s;hort petticoats, unle&s;s it be &s;ome &s;quire's
aukward daughter, who never yet heard of a <HI>Poloneze</HI> and never
accidentally &s;hews her leg without blu&s;hing?</P>
<P>IT is true this &s;imilitude in dre&s;s now and then
occa&s;ions &s;ome droll mi&s;takes. In the park the joke has been &s;ome|times
carried &s;o far I have been obliged to call the centry: and how did a young
templar &s;tart and &s;tare when, having ju&s;t made an appointment with him,
he &s;aw me &s;tep into a chair adorned with coronets!</P>
<P>IF you frequent <HI>Ranelagh</HI> you mu&s;t undoubtedly have
&s;een or heard me there. I am always &s;urrounded with a croud of fellows, and
my voice and laugh is &s;ure to be the loude&s;t, e&s;pecially while
<HI>Beard</HI> is &s;inging. One is my <HI>dear</HI> lord, another my
<HI>&s;weet</HI> colonel, and the re&s;t I call <HI>Tom,</HI> or <HI>Dick,</HI>
or <HI>Harry,</HI> as I would their footmen. At the play I always enter in the
fir&s;t act. All the eyes of the hou&s;e are turned upon me. I am quite
compo&s;ed. Before I am &s;ettled the act is over, and to &s;ome I nod or
curt&s;y, with others I talk and laugh till the curtain falls.</P>
<P>WHAT would I give to change my &s;ex! <HI>Entre nous,</HI> I
have a &s;trong inclination to &s;ee the world in ma&s;querade. If you love me,
keep it &s;ecret, and &s;hould you hear of any prank more wild and bucki&s;h

<P>_NOTHING is more natural than for the quacks of all
profe&s;&s;ions to recommend their wares to tho&s;e per&s;ons who are mo&s;t
likely to &s;tand in need of them. Thus Mrs. <HI>Giles</HI> very properly
acquaints the fair &s;ex, that &s;he fells her fine compound for taking off
&s;uperfluous hairs at a guinea an ounce: and ladies of quality are
con&s;tantly informed, where they may be furni&s;hed with the newe&s;t
brocades, or the choice&s;t variety of <HI>Chel&s;ea</HI> China figures for
de&s;erts. It is very nece&s;&s;ary that the <HI>Beau Monde</HI> &s;hould be
acquainted that <HI>Eau de Luce</HI> is prepared here in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> the
&s;ame as at <HI>Paris:</HI> but I mu&s;t own I was very much &s;urpri&s;ed at
&s;eeing repeated adverti&s;ements in the papers <PB N="314" REF="321"> from
the Rich Cordial Warehou&s;e, introduced by an addre&s;s "TO THE PEOPLE OF
FASHION." I cannot but look upon this as a libel on our per&s;ons of
di&s;tinction, and I know not whether it may not be con&s;trued into
<HI>&s;candalum magnatum</HI>; as it tacitly in&s;inuates, that our Right
Honour|ables are no better than Dram-drinkers.</P>
<P>THERE is a well-known &s;tory of the famous <HI>Rabelais,</HI>
that having a mind to impo&s;e on the curio&s;ity of his landlord, he filled
&s;everal vials with an innocent liquor, and directed them with&mdash;Poi&s;on
for the King,&mdash;Poi&s;on for the Dauphin,&mdash;Poi&s;on for the Prime
Mini&s;ter,&mdash;and for all the principal courtiers. The &s;ame might be
&s;aid of the&s;e Rich Cordial Liquors, which however they may recommend
them&s;elves to the People of Fa&s;hion by their foreign titles and extraction,
are to be con&s;idered as poi&s;ons in ma&s;querade: and in&s;tead of the
pompous names of <HI>Eau d'Or, Eau Divine,</HI> and the like, I would have
labels fixed on the bottles (in imitation of <HI>Rabelais)</HI>
with&mdash;Poi&s;on for my Lord Duke,&mdash;Poi&s;on for the
Vi&s;count,&mdash;Poi&s;on for the Counte&s;s.</P>
<P>WE live, indeed, in &s;o polite an age, that nothing goes down
with us, but what is either imported from <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI>
or dignified with a foreign appellation. Our dre&s;s mu&s;t be entirely
<HI>&aacute; la mode de Paris</HI>; and I will ven|ture to en&s;ure great
&s;ucce&s;s to the <HI>Mon&s;ieur</HI> taylor, who tells us in the public
papers, that he has ju&s;t been to <HI>France</HI> to &s;ee the newe&s;t
fa&s;hions. A dinner is not worth eating, if not &s;erved up by a
<HI>French</HI> cook; our wines are of the &s;ame country; and the
Dram-drinkers of Fa&s;hion comfort their &s;pirits with Rich Cordials from
<HI>Chamberry, Neuilly,</HI> and <HI>l'I&s;le de Rh&egrave;.</HI> A plain man
mu&s;t undoubtedly &s;mile at the alluring names which are given to many of
them; nor is it <PB N="315" REF="322"> po&s;&s;ible to gue&s;s at their
compo&s;ition from their title. The virtues, as well as the intent, of Viper
Water may be well known: but who would imagine, that <HI>Flora Granata,</HI> or
<HI>Belle de Nuit</HI> &s;hould be intended only to &s;ignify a dram? For my
own part I &s;hould rather have taken <HI>Mara&s;quino</HI> for an
<HI>Italian</HI> fidler, and have concluded that <HI>Jacomonodi</HI> was no
other than an Opera-Singer.</P>
<P>BUT Dram-drinking, however different in the phra&s;e, is the
&s;ame in the practice, in every &s;tation of life; and &s;ipping Rich Cordials
is no le&s;s dete&s;table, than in the vulgar idiom Bunging your Eye. What
&s;ignifies it, whether we meddle with <HI>Eau de Millefleurs</HI> or plain
ani&s;eed? or whether we fetch our drams from the Rich Cordial Warehou&s;e, or
the Blackamoor and Golden Still? The lady of St. <HI>James</HI>'s, who paints
her face with frequent applications of coffee or chocolate water, looks as
hideous as the trollop of St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s, who has laid on the &s;ame
colours by repeated half-quarterns of Gin Royal. There are many cu&s;toms among
the Great, which are al&s;o practi&s;ed by the lower &s;ort of people: and if
per&s;ons of fa&s;hion mu&s;t wrap up their drams in the di&s;gui&s;e of a
variety of &s;pecious titles, in this too they are rivalled by the vulgar.
Madam Gin has been chri&s;tened by as many names as a <HI>German</HI>
prince&s;s: every petty chandler's &s;hop will &s;ell you Sky-blue, and every
night-cellar furni&s;h you with <HI>Holland</HI> Tape, three yards a penny. Nor
can I &s;ee the difference between <HI>Oil of Venus,</HI> Spirit of
<HI>Adonis,</HI> and <HI>Parfait Amour,</HI> for the u&s;e of our Quality, and
what among the vulgar is called <HI>Cupid's</HI> Eye-water, <HI>Strip me
naked,</HI> and <HI>Lay me down &s;oftly.</HI></P>
<P>TO the&s;e elegant and genteel appellations it is, indeed,
chiefly owing, that Drams are not confined merely to the vulgar, but are in
e&s;teem among all ranks of people, and <PB N="316" REF="323"> e&s;pecially
among the ladies. Many a good woman, who would &s;tart at the mention of Strong
Waters, cannot conceive there can be any harm in a Cordial. And as the fair
&s;ex are more particularly &s;ubject to a depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits, it is
no wonder that they &s;hould convert their apothecaries &s;hops into Rich
Cordial Warehou&s;es, and take Drams by way of phy&s;ick; as the common people
make Gin &s;erve for meat, drink, and cloaths. The ladies perhaps may not be
aware that every time they have recour&s;e to their Hart&s;horn or Lavender
Drops, to drive away the vapours, they in effect take a Dram; and they may be
a&s;&s;ured, that their Cholic, Surfeit, and Plague Waters are to be ranked
among &s;piri|tuous liquors, as well as the common &s;tuff at the Gin-&s;hop.
The College of Phy&s;icians, in their la&s;t review of the <HI>London</HI>
Di&s;pen&s;atory, for this very rea&s;on expelled the Strong Water generally
known by the &s;oothing name of Hy&s;teric Water; becau&s;e it was a lure to
the female &s;ex to dram it by autho|rity, and to get tip&s;y <HI>&s;ecundum
artem.</HI></P>
<P>IF any of my fair readers have at all given into this
per|nicious practice of Dram-drinking, I mu&s;t intreat them to leave it off
betimes, before it has taken &s;uch hold of them, as they can never &s;hake
off. For the de&s;ire of Drams &s;teals upon them, and grows to be habitual, by
imperceptible degrees: as tho&s;e, who are accu&s;tomed to take Opiates, are
obliged to encrea&s;e the do&s;e gradually, and at la&s;t cannot &s;leep
without it. The following letter may &s;erve to convince them of the deplorable
&s;ituation of a lady, who covers her drinking under the pretence of mending
her con&s;titution.</P>

<P>I HAVE the misfortune to be married to a poor &s;ickly

hold a gla&s;s of Rum in her mouth, to numb the pain: at other times &s;he is
&s;eized with a racking fit of the cholic, and nothing will &s;o &s;oon give
her ea&s;e as &s;ome Right <HI>Holland</HI>'s Gin. She has the gout in her
con&s;titution, and whenever &s;he feels a twitch of it, the only thing is
&s;heer Brandy to keep it from her head: but this is &s;ometimes too
<HI>cold</HI> for her, and &s;he is forced to drive it out of her &s;tomach
with true <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> U&s;quebaugh. She is never free from the vapours,
notwith&s;tanding &s;he is conti|nually drinking Hart&s;horn and water: and
ever &s;ince &s;he mi&s;carried, &s;he is &s;o hy&s;terical in the night time,
that &s;he never lies without a Cordial-Water bottle by her bed&s;ide. I have
paid the apothecary about fifty pounds for her in one year, and his bill is
laced down with nothing but Drops, Pepper Mint Water, and the Cordial Draught
repeated.</P>
<P>HER very diet mu&s;t always be made <HI>heartening,</HI>
other|wi&s;e it will do her no good. Tea would make her low-&s;pirited, except
&s;he was to qualify every di&s;h with a large &s;poonful of Rum. She has a
gla&s;s of Mountain with Bitters an hour before dinner to create an appetite:
and her &s;tomach is &s;o poor, that when &s;he is at table, &s;he mu&s;t force
every bit down with a gla&s;s of Madeira. We u&s;ually have a tiff of punch
together in the evening: but the acid would gripe her, and the water keep her
awake all the night, if it was not made <HI>comfortable</HI> with more than an
equal portion of Spirit.</P>
<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding the grievous complaints &s;he hourly
labours under, &s;he is very hale, and her complexion is, to 
<PB N="318" REF="325"> all appearance, as healthy and florid, as a milk-maid's:
except indeed that her no&s;e and forehead are &s;ubject to red pimples,
blotches, and breakings out, which the apothecary tells me are owing to a kind
of an acrimonious humour in her blood. For my part, con&s;idering the quantity
of combu&s;tibles &s;he continually pours down, I &s;hould imagine the fire in
her &s;tomach would kindle a flame in her countenance; and I &s;hould not
wonder if her face looked as horrible, as tho&s;e who hang over a bowl of burnt
Brandy at Snap-Dragon.</P>

<P>_THE noble&s;t exploit of a Man of the Town, the highe&s;t proof
and utmo&s;t effort of his genius and plea&s;antry is <HI>The</HI> FROLICK.
This piece of humour con&s;i&s;ts in playing the mo&s;t wild and extravagant
pranks that wantonne&s;s and debauchery can &s;ugge&s;t; and is the
di&s;|tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tic of the Buck and Blood. The&s;e facetious
gentlemen, whenever Champagne has put them in &s;pirits, &s;ally out 
<Q REND="inline">"flown with in&s;olence and wine"</Q> in que&s;t
of adventures. At &s;uch a time the more harm they do the more they &s;hew
their wit; and their Fro|licks, like the mirth of a monkey, are made up of
mi&s;chief.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="327">THE Frolick formerly &s;ignified nothing
more than a piece of innocent mirth and gaiety; but the modern &s;en&s;e of the
word is much more lively and &s;pirited. The Mohocks and Hell Fire Club, the
heroes of the la&s;t generation, were the fir&s;t who introduced the&s;e
elevated Frolicks, and &s;truck out mighty good jokes from all kinds of
violence and bla&s;phemy. The pre&s;ent race of Bucks commonly begin their
Frolick in a tavern, and end it in the round-hou&s;e, and during the cour&s;e
of it practi&s;e &s;everal mighty pretty plea&s;antries. There is a great deal
of humour in what is called <HI>beating the rounds,</HI> that is in plain
<HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> taking a tour of the principal bawdy-hou&s;es: breaking of
lamps and &s;kirmi&s;hes with watchmen are very good je&s;ts; and the
in&s;ulting any dull &s;ober fools that are quietly trudging about their
bu&s;ine&s;s, or a rape on a mode&s;t woman are particularly facetious.
Whatever is in violation of all decency and order is an exqui&s;ite piece of
wit, and in &s;hort a Frolick and <HI>playing the devil</HI> bear the &s;ame
explanation in a modern glo&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>IT is &s;urprizing how much invention there is in the&s;e
exploits, and how wine in&s;pires the&s;e gentlemen with thoughts more
extraordinary and &s;ublime than any &s;ober man could ever have devi&s;ed. I
have known a whole com|pany &s;tart from their chairs, and begin tilting at
each other merely for their diver&s;ion. Another time the&s;e exalted
geni|u&s;&s;es have ca&s;t lots which &s;hould be thrown out of the win|dow;
and at another make a bonfire of their cloaths and run naked into the
&s;treets. I remember a little gentleman not above five feet high, who was
re&s;olved, merely for the &s;ake of the Frolick, to lie with the Tall Woman,
but the joke ended in his receiving a &s;ound cudgelling from the hands of his
<HI>Thale&s;tris.</HI> It was no longer ago than la&s;t winter that a party of
jovial Templars &s;et out an hour or two after mid|night <PB N="321" REF="328">
on a voyage to <HI>Li&s;bon</HI> in order to get good Port. They took boat at
the Temple-&s;tairs, and prudently laid in by way of provi&s;ions a cold
veni&s;on pa&s;ty and two bottles of ra&s;berry brandy: but when they imagined
them&s;elves ju&s;t arrived at <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> they found them&s;elves
&s;uddenly over|&s;et in <HI>Chel&s;ea</HI>-Reach, and very narrowly e&s;caped
being drowned. The mo&s;t innocent Frolicks of the&s;e men of humour are
carried on in a literary way by adverti&s;ements in the new&s;papers, with
which they often amu&s;e the town; and alarm us with bottle-conjurors, and
per&s;ons who will jump down their own throats. Sometimes they divert
them|&s;elves by impo&s;ing on their acquaintance with fictitious in|trigues,
and putting mode&s;t women to the blu&s;h by de|&s;cribing them in the publick
papers. Once, I remember, it was the Frolick to call together all the wet
nur&s;es that want|ed a place; at another time to &s;ummon &s;everal old women
to bring their male tabby cats, for which they were to expect a con&s;iderable
price; and not long ago, by the proffer of a curacy, they drew all the poor
par&s;ons to St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Coffee-hou&s;e, where the Bucks them&s;elves
&s;at in another box to &s;moke their ru&s;ty wigs and brown ca&s;&s;ocks.</P>
<P>BUT the highe&s;t Frolick that can po&s;&s;ibly be put in
execution is a genteel murder; &s;uch as running a waiter through the body,
knocking an old feeble watchman's brains out with his own &s;taff, or taking
away the life of &s;ome re|gular &s;coundrel, who has not &s;pirit enough to
whore and drink like a gentleman. The noble&s;t Frolick of this kind I ever
remember happened a few years ago at a country town. While a party of Bucks
were making a riot at an inn, and to&s;&s;ing the chairs and tables, and
looking-gla&s;&s;es into the &s;treet, the landlady was indi&s;creet enough to
come up &s;tairs, and interrupt their merriment with her imperti|nent
remon&s;trances; upon which they immediately threw <PB N="322" REF="329"> her
out of the window after her own furniture. News was &s;oon brought of the poor
woman's death, and the whole company looked upon it as a very droll accident,
and gave orders that &s;he &s;hould be charged in the bill.</P>
<P>THESE wild pranks are in&s;tances of great &s;pirit and
invention, but, alas! the generality of mankind have no ta&s;te for humour. Few
people care to have a &s;word in their ribs for the &s;ake of the joke, or to
be beat to mummy or &s;hot through the head for the diver&s;ion of the good
company. They &s;ometimes imagine the je&s;t is carried too far, and are apt to
apply the words of the old fable, 
<Q REND="inline">"It may be &s;port to you, but it is death to
us."</Q> For the&s;e rea&s;ons a &s;et of the&s;e merry gentlemen are as
terrible to the ordinary part of the world as a troop of banditti; and an
affair which has been thought very high fun in. <HI>Pall Mall</HI> or
<HI>Covent Garden,</HI> has been treated in a very &s;erious manner at
<HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall</HI> or the <HI>Old Baily.</HI> Our legi&s;lature has
been ab&s;urd enough to be very careful of the lives of the lowe&s;t among the
people, and the council for a highwayman would &s;ooner plead di&s;tre&s;s as
an excu&s;e for di&s;charging his pi&s;tol than mere wantonne&s;s and Frolick
Nor do the governments abroad entertain a better opinion of this &s;ort of
humour; for it is but a few years, &s;ince a gentleman on his travels who was
compleating a Town Education by the polite tour, &s;hot a waiter through the
head: but the joke was &s;o ill received, that the gentleman was hanged within
four and twenty hours. It would be advi&s;eable therefore for the&s;e
gentlemen, &s;ince the ta&s;te of the age is &s;o incorrigible, to lay a&s;ide
this high-&s;ea&s;oned humour. For their pi&s;tol, as it were, recoils upon
them|&s;elves, and &s;ince it may produce their own deaths, it would be more
prudent not to draw their wit out of their &s;cabbards.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="330">OUR Ladies of quality, who have at length
adopted <HI>French</HI> manners with <HI>French</HI> fa&s;hions, and thrown off
all &s;tarchne&s;s and re&s;erve with the ruff and the farthingale, are very
fond of a Frolick. I have indeed lately ob&s;erved with great plea&s;ure the
commendable attempts of the other &s;ex to &s;hake of the &s;hackles of
cu&s;tom, and I make no doubt but a libertine lady will &s;oon become a very
common character. If their pa&s;&s;ion for Gaming continues to encrea&s;e in
the &s;ame proportion that it has for &s;ome time pa&s;t, we &s;hall very
&s;oon meet with abundance of &s;harpers in petticoats; and it will be
mentioned as a very familiar incident that a party of female gamblers were
&s;iezed by the con&s;tables at the gaming-table. I am al&s;o informed that it
is grown very common among the ladies to toa&s;t pretty fellows; and that they
often amu&s;e them&s;elves with concerting &s;chemes for an excellent Frolick.
A Frolick is indeed the mo&s;t conve|nient name in the world to veil an
intrigue, and it is a great pity that hu&s;bands and fathers &s;hould ever
object to it. I can &s;ee no harm in a lady's going di&s;gui&s;ed to mob it in
the gallery at the play-hou&s;e; and could not but &s;mile at the pretty
innocent wanton who carried the joke &s;o far as to ac|company a &s;trange
gentleman to a bagnio; but when &s;he came there, was &s;urprized to find that
he was fond of a Frolick as well as her&s;elf, and offered her violence. But I
particularly admire the &s;pirit of that lady, who had &s;uch true reli&s;h for
a Frolick, as to go with her gallant to the Ma&s;querade, though &s;he knew he
had no breeches under his Domino.</P>
<P>I MOST heartily congratulate the fine ladies and gentlemen of
the age on the &s;pirit with which they per&s;ue their diver&s;ions; and I look
upon a bold Frolick as the peculiar privilege of a per&s;on of fa&s;hion. The
ladies undoubtedly &s;ee a great deal of plea&s;antry in an intrigue, and 
<PB N="324" REF="331"> mimick the dre&s;s and manners of the courtezans very
hap|pily and facetiou&s;ly: while the gentlemen, among many other new fancies,
have made the old blunder of the Merry Andrew, appear no longer ridiculous, and
are mightily plea&s;ed with the <HI>comical humours of a murder.</HI> The
Fro|licks now in vogue will probably continue to be the amu&s;e|ments of the
polite world for a long time; but whenever the fa&s;hion is about to vary, I
beg leave to propo&s;e the Frolick recommended, if I remember right, to the
Duke of <HI>Wharton</HI> by Dr. <HI>Swift.</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"When you are tired of your other Frolicks, I
would have you take up the Frolick of BEING GOOD; and take my word for it, you
will find it the mo&s;t agreeable Frolick you ever practi&s;ed in your
life.</Q></P>

<DIV2 TYPE="body of issue">
<P>_THERE once prevailed among us a &s;ect called <HI>The</HI>
ADAMITES, who&s;e doctrine, like that of our pre&s;ent <HI>Moravians,</HI> was
calcula|ted to comfort the fle&s;h as well as the &s;pirit, and many things
generally accounted inde|cent and immode&s;t, were with them regarded as
principles of religion. The chief article maintained by this &s;ect was, that
it was proper, like our great forefather <HI>Adam,</HI> to go naked; and the
pro&s;elytes to this faith came abroad in the public &s;treets and open
daylight without any cloathing. But this primitive &s;implicity did not agree
with the notions of tho&s;e degenerate days, and the ADAMITES were looked 
<PB N="326" REF="333"> upon as an intolerable nu&s;ance. Their religion, like
all o|thers, was &s;oon attended with per&s;ecution; and &s;ome of the converts
were dragged naked to the cart's tail, &s;ome &s;et in the &s;tocks, and others
&s;ent to <HI>Bridewell.</HI></P>
<P>SINCE that remarkable period the male part of our &s;pecies have
been decently covered; but the female world has made &s;everal bold attempts to
throw off the incum|brance of cloaths. Caps, handkerchiefs, tuckers, and
mo|de&s;ty-pieces have been long di&s;carded; and the ladies have continued
every year to &s;hed &s;ome other part of their dre&s;s as u&s;ele&s;s and
unornamental. But the&s;e are only half a&s;&s;er|tions of the female rights
and natural liberty, in com|pari&s;on to the project, which, it is thought,
will be ripe for execution by &s;ummer. A &s;et of ladies of the fir&s;t
fa&s;hion have agreed to found a &s;ect of <LB>EVITES, <LB>who are to appear in
public with no other covering than the original Fig-leaf. The primitive
&s;implicity of appear|ance will be re&s;tored: and, though &s;ome may be
cen&s;orious enough to imagine that their confidence ari&s;es from very
different principles, it may very ju&s;tly be &s;aid of our ladies of quality,
as of our fir&s;t parents before the fall, 
<Q REND="inline">"They are naked, and <HI>are not
a&s;hamed.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>MY country readers, and all tho&s;e who live at a di&s;tance
from the polite world, may perhaps look upon this &s;cheme as merely
fanta&s;tical and imaginary; but nothing is more true. The milliners are at
this time all very bu&s;y in making up artificial Fig-leaves, and adorning them
according to the different fancies of the wearers. There is more ta&s;te
di&s;|played in contriving an elegant Fig-leaf, than has hitherto been exerted
in forming a genteel &s;word-knot. Some have <PB N="327" REF="334"> bunches of
the gaye&s;t coloured ribbons dangling loo&s;ely from the &s;talk, others
to&s;&s;els of gold and &s;ilver lace, and a few de&s;igned for ladies of the
highe&s;t di&s;tinction bunches of diamonds. This and the <HI>Pompon,</HI>
which it is &s;aid has been lately worn merely as a type of the Fig-leaf, will
make up the common dre&s;s of the whole female world: but if ever the weather
&s;hould be too &s;evere for the ladies to appear (as <HI>Bayes</HI>
expre&s;&s;es it) <HI>in puris naturalibus,</HI> they are to wear
fle&s;h-coloured &s;ilks with <HI>Pompons</HI> and Fig-leaves as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>THERE are perhaps per&s;ons who as they &s;till retain &s;ome of
the leaven of decency in their compo&s;ition, will be &s;tartled at this
project. I mu&s;t own however that it does not appear to me to be in the
lea&s;t extraordinary or &s;urpri|zing: for con&s;idering the pre&s;ent dre&s;s
of our women of fa&s;hion, there remains no further &s;tep to be taken except
ab&s;olute nakedne&s;s. The &s;tays and petticoat have been &s;o unmercifully
pruned and cut away in order to di&s;cover latent beauties, that if tho&s;e of
the pre&s;ent mode were to fall into the hands of our di&s;tant po&s;terity
they would conclude that the pre&s;ent race of women mu&s;t have been a
generation of pigmies; for they could never po&s;&s;ibly conceive that they
were of common &s;ize, and wore by way of dre&s;s any garments &s;o little
calculated either for u&s;e or ornament. If one might judge by appearances, the
little mode&s;ty that is left in the polite world &s;eems to be among the men;
and one is almo&s;t tempted to look for the rakes, and per&s;ons of intrigue in
the other &s;ex. I was pre&s;ent a few nights ago at the repre|&s;entation of
<HI>The Chances</HI>; and when I looked round the boxes and ob&s;erved the
loo&s;e dre&s;s of all the ladies, and the great reli&s;h with which they
received the high-&s;ea&s;oned je&s;ts in that Comedy, I was almo&s;t
apprehen&s;ive that the old &s;tory of the outrage of the <HI>Romans</HI> on
the <HI>Sabine</HI> women would be inverted, and that the ladies would ri&s;e
up, and commit a rape on the men.</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="335">BUT notwith&s;tanding all that may be
&s;aid again&s;t this project for e&s;tabli&s;hing nakedne&s;s, it is not
without example. Among the <HI>Hottentots,</HI> a very wi&s;e and polite
nation, the ladies at this day go quite naked, except a loo&s;e mantle thrown
over their &s;houlders, and a &s;hort apron before in&s;tead of a fig leaf. It
is al&s;o well known that the <HI>Spartans</HI> al|lowed their unmarried women
to wear a &s;ort of a loo&s;e robe, which at every motion di&s;covered their
charms through &s;e|veral openings contrived for that purpo&s;e. There would
certainly be no harm in extending this liberty to the whole &s;ex, and I am not
in the lea&s;t inclined to li&s;ten to the malignant in&s;inuations that when a
married woman endea|vours to look particularly tempting, it is not merely to
plea&s;e her hu&s;band, but to captivate a gallant. It may per|haps be further
objected that our Northern climate is too cold to &s;trip in: but this little
inconvenience is amply com|pen&s;ated by the &s;ecurity the ladies will create
to them&s;elves by taking &s;uch extraordinary liberties, and carrying matters
&s;o very far that it will be indecent even to reprehend them.</P>
<P>THERE is however a very large part of the &s;ex, for whom I am
greatly concerned on this occa&s;ion. I mean the Old and the Ugly. Whatever the
Belles may get by this fa&s;hion, the&s;e poor ladies will be great
&s;ufferers. Their faces are already more than is agreeable to be &s;hewn; but
if they expo&s;e &s;ickly &s;kins furrowed and pur&s;ed up like
wa&s;her|women's fingers, the &s;ight will become too di&s;gu&s;ting. During
the pre&s;ent mode I have ob&s;erved that the di&s;play of a yellow neck or
clum&s;y leg has created but few admirers: and it is rea&s;onable to conclude
that when the new fa&s;hion begins to prevail univer&s;ally, although our men
of plea&s;ure will be glad to &s;ee the young and beautiful ladies, whom they
would de&s;ire to take into their arms, &s;tripping as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible,
yet they are not &s;o fond of primitive and original <PB N="329" REF="336">
&s;implicity as to be captivated by a lady who has none of the charms of
<HI>EVE,</HI> except her nakedne&s;s.</P>
<P>SOME per&s;ons of more than ordinary penetration are apt to look
on this project in a political light, and con&s;ider it as a &s;cheme to
counter-work the Marriage-Act. But as the chief ladies who concerted it are
already provided with hu&s;|bands, and are known to be very well affected to
the Government, this does not appear probable. It is more likely to be an
artifice of the Beauties to make their &s;uperi|ority inconte&s;tible, by
drawing in the dowdies of the &s;ex to &s;uffer by &s;uch an injurious
contra&s;t. However this may be, it is very certain that the mo&s;t lovely of
the &s;ex are about to employ the whole artillery of their charms again&s;t us,
and indeed &s;eem re&s;olved to &s;hoot us flying. On this occa&s;ion it is to
be hoped that the practice of painting, which is now &s;o very fa&s;hionable,
will be entirely laid a|&s;ide: for whoever incru&s;ts her&s;elf in paint can
never be al|lowed to be naked; and it is &s;urely more elegant for a lady to be
covered even with &s;ilk and linen, than to be daubed, like an old wall, with
plai&s;ter and rough-ca&s;t.</P>
<P>AFTER this account of the &s;chemes of our modi&s;h fe|males now
in agitation, which the reader may depend upon as genuine, it only remains to
let him know how I came by my intelligence. <HI>The</HI> PARLIAMENT OF WOMEN
lately propo&s;ed is now actually &s;itting. Upon their fir&s;t meeting after
the preliminaries were adju&s;ted, the whole hou&s;e na|turally re&s;olved
it&s;elf into a Committee on the affairs of Dre&s;s. The Fig-leaf Bill, the
purport of which is contained in this paper, was brought in a by noble
Counte&s;s, and oc|ca&s;ioned &s;ome very warm debates. Two ladies in
particular made &s;everal remarkable &s;peeches on this occa&s;ion: but 
<PB N="330" REF="337"> they were both imagined to &s;peak, like our male
patriots, more for their own private intere&s;t than for the good of the
Public. For one of the&s;e ladies, who in&s;i&s;ted very earne&s;tly on the
decency of &s;ome &s;ort of covering, and has a very beautiful face, is
&s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pected not to be &s;o much above all rivalry in the turn and
proportion of her limbs: and the other, who was impatient to be undre&s;&s;ed
with all expedition, was thought to be too much influenced by her known
partiality to a favourite mole, which now lays out of &s;ight. The Bill however
was pa&s;&s;ed by a very con&s;iderable majority, and is intended to be put in
force by Mid&s;ummer Day next en&s;uing.</P>

con&s;picuous as in the affairs of love. When a raw girl's brain is once turned
with a &s;weetheart, &s;he converts every trifling accident of her life into a
good or bad omen, and makes every thing con&s;pire to &s;trengthen her in &s;o
plea&s;ing a delu&s;ion. <HI>Virgil</HI> repre&s;ents <HI>Dido,</HI> as &s;oon
as &s;he has contracted her fatal pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Aeneas,</HI> as going to
the prie&s;ts to have her fortune told. In like manner the love&s;ick girl runs
to the cunning-man, or cro&s;&s;es the gip&s;y's <PB N="332" REF="339"> hand
with her la&s;t &s;ixpence, to know when &s;he &s;hall be married, how many
children &s;he &s;hall have, and whether &s;he &s;hall be happy with her
hu&s;band. She al&s;o con&s;ults the cards, and finds out her lover in the
Knave of Hearts. She learns how to interpret dreams, and every night
furni&s;hes her with meditations for the next day. If &s;he happens to bring
out any thing in conver&s;ation which another per&s;on was about to &s;ay,
&s;he comforts her&s;elf that &s;he &s;hall be married before them; and if
&s;he tumbles as &s;he is running up &s;tairs, imagines &s;he &s;hall go to
church with her &s;weet|heart before the week is at an end. But if in the
cour&s;e of their amour &s;he gives the dear man her hair wove in a
True-lover's Knot, or breaks a crooked nine pence with him, &s;he thinks
her&s;elf a&s;&s;ured of his inviolable fidelity.</P>
<P>IT would puzzle the mo&s;t profound antiquary to di&s;co|ver
what could give birth to the many &s;trange notions che|ri&s;hed by fond nymphs
and &s;wains. The God of Love has more &s;uper&s;titious votaries, and is
wor&s;hipped with more un|accountable rites than any fabulous deity whatever.
Nothing indeed is &s;o whim&s;ical as the imagination of a per&s;on in love.
The dying &s;hepherd carves the name of his mi&s;tre&s;s on the trees, while
the fond maid knits him a pair of garters with an amorous po&s;ey; and both
look on what they do as a kind of charm to &s;ecure the affection of the other.
A lover will rejoice to give his mi&s;tre&s;s a bracelet or a top|knot, and
&s;he perhaps will take plea&s;ure in working him a pair of ruffles. The&s;e
they will regard as the &s;oft bonds of love, but neither would on any account
run the ri&s;k of <HI>cutting love,</HI> by giving or receiving &s;uch a
pre&s;ent as a knife or a pair of &s;ci&s;&s;ars. But to wear the picture of
the beloved object con&s;tantly near the heart is univer&s;ally accounted a
mo&s;t excellent and never-failing pre&s;ervative of affection.</P>
<P><PB N="333" REF="340">SOME few years ago there was publickly
adverti&s;ed, a|mong the other extraordinary medicines who&s;e wonderful
qualities are daily related in the la&s;t page of our news|papers, a mo&s;t
efficacious love-powder; by which a de&s;pair|ing lover might create affection
in the bo&s;om of the mo&s;t cruel mi&s;tre&s;s. Lovers have indeed always been
fond of enchantment. <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> has repre&s;ented <HI>Othello</HI>
as ac|cu&s;ed of winning his <HI>De&s;demona</HI> by 
<Q REND="inline">"conjuration and mighty magic;"</Q> and
<HI>Theocritus</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> have both in|troduced women into their

&s;weethearts. In a word, Tali&s;mans, Genii, Witches, Fairies, and all the
in&s;truments of magic and enchantment were fir&s;t di&s;covered by lovers, and
employed in the bu&s;ine&s;s of love.</P>
<P>BUT I never had a thorough in&s;ight into all this amorous
&s;orcery till I received the following letter, which was &s;ent me from the

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU mu&s;t know I am in love with a very clever man, a
Londoner; and as I want to know whether it is my fortune to have him, I have
tried all the tricks I can hear of for that purpo&s;e. I have &s;een him
&s;everal times in Coffee-grounds with a &s;word by his &s;ide; and he was once
at the bottom of a Tea-cup in a coach and &s;ix with two footmen behind it. I
got up la&s;t May morning, and went into the fields to hear the cuckow; and
when I pulled off my left &s;hoe, I found an hair in it exactly the 
<PB N="334" REF="341"> &s;ame colour with his. But I &s;hall never forget what
I did la&s;t Mid&s;ummer Eve. I and my two &s;i&s;ters tried the Dumb Cake
together: you mu&s;t know, two mu&s;t make it, two bake it, two break it, and
the third put it under each of their pillows, (but you mu&s;t not &s;peak a
word all the time) and then you will dream of the man you are to have. This we
did; and to be &s;ure I did nothing all night, but dream of Mr.
<HI>Blo&s;&s;om.</HI> The &s;ame night, exactly at twelve o'clock, I &s;owed
Hemp&s;eed in our back yard, and &s;aid to my&s;elf, 
<Q REND="inline">"Hemp&s;eed I &s;ow, Hemp&s;eed I hoe, and he
that is my true-love, come after me and mow."</Q> Will you be|lieve me? I
looked back, and &s;aw him behind me, as plain as eyes could &s;ee him. After
that, I took a clean &s;hift, and turned it, and hung upon the back of a chair;
and very likely my &s;weetheart would have come and turned it right again, (for
I heard his &s;tep) but I was frightened, and could not help &s;peaking, which
broke the charm. I likewi&s;e &s;tuck up two Mid&s;ummer Men, one for my&s;elf,
and one for him. Now if his had died away, we &s;hould never have come
together: but I a&s;&s;ure you he blowed and turned to me. Our maid
<HI>Betty</HI> tells me, that if I go backwards with|out &s;peaking a word into
the garden upon Mid&s;ummer Eve, and gather a Ro&s;e, and keep it in a clean
&s;heet of paper, without looking at it, till <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> day, it will
be as fre&s;h as in June; and if I then &s;tick it in my bo&s;om, he that is to
be my hu&s;band will come and take it out. If I am not married before the time
comes about again, I will certainly do it; and only mind if Mr.
<HI>Blo&s;&s;om</HI> is not the man.</P>
<P>I HAVE tried a great many other fancies, and they have all
turned out right. Whenever I go to lye in a &s;trange bed, I always tye my
garter nine times round the bed-po&s;t, and <PB N="335" REF="342"> knit nine
knots in it, and &s;ay to my&s;elf, <HI>This knot I knit, this knot I tye, To
&s;ee my love as he goes by, In his apparel and array, As he walks in every
day.</HI> I did &s;o la&s;t holidays at my uncle's; and to be &s;ure I &s;aw
Mr. <HI>Blo&s;&s;om</HI> draw my cur|tains and tuck up the cloaths at my bed's
feet. Cou&s;in <HI>Debby</HI> was married a little while ago, and &s;he &s;ent
me a piece of Bride-Cake to put under my pillow; and I had the &s;weete&s;t
dream&mdash;I thought we were going to be married together. I have, many is the
time, taken great pains to pare an Apple Whole, and afterwards flung the Peel
over my head; and it always falls in the &s;hape of the fir&s;t letter of his
Sirname or Chri&s;tian name. I am &s;ure Mr. <HI>Blo&s;&s;om</HI> loves me,
becau&s;e I &s;tuck two of the Kernels upon my forehead, while I thought upon
him and the lubberly &s;quire my pappa wants me to have: Mr.
<HI>Blo&s;&s;om</HI>'s Kernel &s;tuck on, but the other dropt off directly.</P>
<P>LAST Friday, Mr. TOWN, was <HI>Valentine</HI>'s Day; and I'll
tell you what I did the night before. I got five bay-leaves, and pinned four of
them to the four corners of my pillow, and the fifth to the middle; and then if
I dreamt of my &s;weet|heart, <HI>Betty</HI> &s;aid we &s;hould be married
before the year was out. But to make it more &s;ure, I boiled an egg hard, and
took out the yolk, and filled it up with &s;alt; and when I went to bed, eat it
&s;hell and all, without &s;peaking or drink|ing after it: and this was to have
the &s;ame effect with the bay-leaves. We al&s;o wrote our lovers names upon
bits of paper, and rolled them up in clay, and put them into wa|ter; and the
fir&s;t that ro&s;e up, was to be our Valentine. Would you think it? Mr.
<HI>Blo&s;&s;om</HI> was my man: and I lay a-bed and &s;hut my eyes all the
morning, till he came to our hou&s;e; for I would not have &s;een another man
before him for all the world.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="343">DEAR Mr. TOWN, if you know any other
ways to try our fortune by, do put them in your paper. My Mamma laughs at us,
and &s;ays there is nothing in them; but I am &s;ure there is, for &s;everal
Mi&s;&s;es at our boarding &s;chool have tried them, and they have all happened
true: and I am &s;ure my own &s;i&s;ter <HI>Hetty,</HI> who died ju&s;t before
<HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> &s;tood in the Church Porch la&s;t Mid&s;ummer Eve to
&s;ee all that were to die that year in our pari&s;h; and &s;he &s;aw her

<P>_THERE is no phra&s;e in the whole voca|bulary of modern
conver&s;ation, which has a more vague &s;ignification than the words 
<Q REND="inline">"Good Company."</Q> People of fa&s;hion
mode&s;tly explain it to mean only them|&s;elves; and, like the old
<HI>Romans,</HI> look on all others as Barbarians. Thus a &s;tar or a ribband,
a title or a place denotes Good Company; and a man ri&s;es in the e&s;teem of
the polite circle according to his rank or his rent-roll. This way of
rea&s;oning is &s;o well known and &s;o generally adopt|ed, that we are not
&s;urprized to hear polite per&s;ons com|plain at their return from the play,
that the hou&s;e was very much crouded, but that there was no Company: though
indeed I could not help &s;miling at a lady's &s;aying &s;he preferred St.
<HI>James</HI>'s church to St. <HI>George</HI>'s, becau&s;e the pews were
commonly filled with better Company.</P>
<P><PB N="338" REF="345">I PROPOSE at pre&s;ent to con&s;ider this
comprehen&s;ive term only as it re&s;pects a &s;ociety of friends, who meet in
order to pa&s;s their time in an agreeable manner. To do this the more
effectually I &s;hall take a cur&s;ory view of the &s;everal methods now in
vogue, by which a &s;et of acquaintance endeavour to amu&s;e each other. The
reader will here meet with &s;ome very extraordinary inventions for this
purpo&s;e; and when he has fixed his choice, may try to introduce him&s;elf
into that company he likes be&s;t.</P>
<P>THERE is a great demand for wit and humour in &s;ome parts of
this metropolis. Among many he is reckoned the Be&s;t Company who can enliven
his conver&s;ation with &s;trokes of facetiou&s;ne&s;s, and in
<HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s words 
<Q REND="inline">"&s;et the table on a roar."</Q> But as wit and
humour do not always fall to the &s;hare of tho&s;e who aim at &s;hining in
conver&s;ation, our jokers and witlings have wi&s;ely devi&s;ed &s;everal
mecha|nical ways of gaining that end. I know one who is thought a very
facetious fellow by the club, of which he is a mem|ber, becau&s;e every night,
as &s;oon as the clock &s;trikes twelve, he begins to crow like a cock. Another
is accounted a man of <HI>immen&s;e humour</HI> for entertaining his friends
with a bur|le&s;que hornpipe: and a third has the reputation of being excellent
Company by &s;inging a &s;ong, and at the &s;ame time playing the tune upon the
table with his knuckles and elbows. Mimickry is in the&s;e &s;ocieties an
indi&s;pen&s;ible re|qui&s;ite in a good companion. Imitations of the actors
and other well-known characters are very much admired. But the mimic is by no
means limited to an imitation of the human &s;pecies; for an exact
repre&s;entation of the brute creation will procure him infinite applau&s;e.
Very many of the&s;e wits may be met with in different quarters of the town;
and it is but a week ago &s;ince I was invited to pa&s;s the evening with a
&s;ociety, which, after a di&s;play of their <PB N="339" REF="346"> &s;everal
talents, I found to con&s;i&s;t of a Dog, a Cat, a Mon|key, an A&s;s, and a
couple of Dancing Bears.</P>
<P>I CANNOT help looking with &s;ome veneration on the wit exerted
in &s;ocieties of this &s;ort, &s;ince it has the extra|ordinary quality of
never creating either di&s;gu&s;t or &s;atiety. They a&s;&s;emble every night,
tell the &s;ame &s;tories, repeat the &s;ame jokes, &s;ing the &s;ame &s;ongs;
and they are every night attended with the &s;ame applau&s;e and merriment.
Con&s;idering how much their wit is u&s;ed, it is &s;urpri&s;ing that it
&s;hould not be worn out. Sometimes however one of the &s;ociety makes a new
acqui&s;ition, which is immedi|ately thrown into the common &s;tock of humour,
and con|&s;tantly di&s;played as part of the entertainment of the even|ing. A
gentleman of this ca&s;t lately &s;hewed me with great joy the po&s;t&s;cript
of a letter, in which his corre&s;pondent promi&s;ed him <HI>huge fun</HI> the
next time he &s;hould &s;ee him, for he had got two new &s;tories and three or
four excellent &s;ongs from one of the actors.</P>
<P>THESE are certainly very agreeable methods of pa&s;&s;ing the
evening, and mu&s;t plea&s;e all per&s;ons who have any reli&s;h for wit and
humour. But the&s;e powers of entertaining are not every where the &s;tandard
of Good Company. There are places in which he is the Be&s;t Company who drinks
mo&s;t. A Boon Companion lays it down as a rule that 
<Q REND="inline">"talking &s;poils conver&s;ation."</Q> A bumper
is his argument, and his fir&s;t care is to promote a bri&s;k circulation of
the bottle. He &s;hews his e&s;teem for an ab&s;ent friend by toa&s;ting him in
a bumper extraordinary, and is frequently &s;o good and loyal a &s;ubject as to
drink His Maje&s;ty's health in half-pints. If he is de&s;ired to &s;ing a
catch, he &s;till keeps the main point in view, and gives a &s;ong wrote in
&s;o ingenious a &s;tile, that it obliges the company to to&s;s off a gla&s;s
at the <PB N="340" REF="347"> end of every &s;tanza. If he talks, it is of 
<Q REND="inline">"healths five fathom deep,"</Q> or a late
<HI>hard bout</HI> with another &s;et of jolly fellows; and he takes care by a
quick round of Toa&s;ts to &s;upply the want of other conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>I HAVE ever thought the invention of Toa&s;ts very u&s;eful and
ingenious. They at once promote hard drinking, and &s;erve as a kind of
memorials of every gla&s;s that has been drank: They al&s;o furni&s;h tho&s;e
with conver&s;ation who have nothing to &s;ay, or at lea&s;t, by bani&s;hing
all other topics, put the whole company on a level. Be&s;ides all this three or
four rounds of Toa&s;ts, where a good many are met toge|ther, mu&s;t
unavoidably lift them all into Good Company. The&s;e are no &s;mall advantages
to &s;ociety; not to mention the wit and morality contained in many
Toa&s;ts.</P>
<P>TOASTS are doubtle&s;s very u&s;eful and entertaining; but the
wi&s;e&s;t in&s;titution ever made in drinking &s;ocieties is the cu&s;tom of
appointing what is called an Ab&s;olute Toa&s;t|ma&s;ter. The gentleman
inve&s;ted with this dignity is created king of the company, and, like other
ab&s;olute monarchs, he commonly makes great u&s;e of his power. It is
particularly his office to name the Toa&s;t, to ob&s;erve that every man duly
to&s;&s;es off his bumper, and is in every re&s;pect Good Company. He is al&s;o
to correct all mi&s;demeanors, and com|monly puni&s;hes an offender by
&s;concing him a bumper: that is, in the language of hard drinkers, not
unmercifully denying him his due gla&s;s, but obliging him to add another to it
of perhaps double the quantity. For offences of a very heinous nature, the
tran&s;gre&s;&s;or is ordered a decanter of water, or a tankard of &s;mall
beer. The privilege of in|flicting a bumper is exerted almo&s;t every moment,
for there is hardly any &s;ort of behaviour which does not produce this
puni&s;hment. I have known a man &s;conced for drinking, <PB N="341" REF="348">
for not drinking, for &s;inging, for talking, for being &s;ilent, and at length
&s;conced dead drunk, and made very Good Company.</P>
<P>BUT none of the&s;e qualifications abovementioned con&s;ti|tute
Good Company in the genteel part of the world. Polite a&s;&s;emblies neither
aim at wit and humour, nor make the lea&s;t pretence to cultivate &s;ociety.
Their whole evenings are con&s;umed at the card-table, without the lea&s;t
attempt at any other conver&s;ation, but the u&s;ual altercations of part|ners
between the deals. Whi&s;t has de&s;troyed conver&s;ation, &s;poilt &s;ociety,
and murdered &s;leep. This kind of Good Company is as ridiculous, and more
in&s;ipid than either the &s;ociety of witlings or hard drinkers. To&s;&s;ing
off bumpers is as rational, and an employment infinitely more joyous than
&s;huffling a pack of cards a whole night: and puns, jokes, and mimickry
however &s;tale and repeated, furni&s;h the company with conver&s;ation of as
much u&s;e and variety as the odd trick, and four by Honours.</P>
<P>SUCH are the agreeable evenings pa&s;&s;ed at <HI>White</HI>'s
and the other coffee-hou&s;es about St. <HI>James</HI>'s. Such is the
happine&s;s of Routes, Drums, and Hurricanes; and without Gaming and intrigues
what in&s;ipid things are even Ma&s;querades and Ridottos! At &s;uch meetings,
the man who is Good Com|pany plays the game very well, knows more ca&s;es than
are in <HI>Hoyle,</HI> and often po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;ome particular
qualifications, which would be no great recommendation to him any where el&s;e.
In&s;tead of meeting together, like other companies, with a de&s;ire of mutual
delight, they &s;it down with a de|&s;ign upon the pockets of each other:
though indeed it is no wonder, when one has &s;tripped another of two or three
thou&s;and pounds, if the &s;uccesful game&s;ter thinks the per&s;on he has
fleeced very Good Company.</P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="349">BY what has been &s;aid it appears that
the notion of Good Company excludes all u&s;eful conver&s;ation: which in
either of the above-mentioned &s;ocieties would undoubtedly be de&s;pi|&s;ed as
&s;tupid and pedantic. The witlings have too lively a genius, and too warm an
imagination to admit it. The Boon Companions can join nothing but love to a
bottle: and among Game&s;ters it would, like &s;leep, be mere lo&s;s of time,
and hinderance of bu&s;ine&s;s. Yet an accompli&s;hed member of either of
the&s;e &s;ocieties is called Good Company; which is ju&s;t as proper an
expre&s;&s;ion, as, according to Serjeant <HI>Kite, Carolus</HI> is good
<HI>Latin</HI> for Queen <HI>Ann,</HI> or a &s;tout beating. But a &s;et of
people who a&s;&s;emble for no other purpo&s;e than to game, have, in
particular, &s;o very bad a title to the denomination of Good Company, that
they ap|pear to me to be the very wor&s;t.</P>

<P>_A MISFORTUNE, which happened to me the other day,
&s;ufficiently convinced me of the inconveniences ari&s;ing from the
indi&s;crimi|nate power lodged in our Pre&s;s Gangs. I would not have the
reader think, that I was pre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf:&mdash;but my Devil (that is, the
me&s;&s;enger of the printing-hou&s;e) was carried off, as he was going with
the copy of a Connoi&s;&s;eur to pre&s;s. Learning appears to me of &s;o much
importance, that (in my opinion) the per|&s;ons of the lowe&s;t retainers to it
&s;hould be &s;acred from <PB N="344" REF="351"> mole&s;tation; and it gives me
concern, (though a very loyal &s;ubject), that even a ballad-&s;inger, or the
hawker of Bloody News &s;hould be interupted in their literary vocations. I
have in vain endeavoured to recover my M.S. again: for, though I cannot but
think any one of my papers of almo&s;t as much con&s;equence to the nation as
the fitting out a fleet, the ignorant &s;ailors were &s;o regardle&s;s of its
ine&s;timable contents, that after much enquiry I detected them (with my Devil
in conjunction) lighting their pipes with it, at a low alehou&s;e by <HI>Puddle
Dock.</HI></P>
<P>THIS irretrievable lo&s;s to the public, as well as my&s;elf,
led me to con&s;ider, whether &s;ome other method might not be thought of, to
rai&s;e &s;ufficient forces for the fleet and army, without di&s;turbing poor
labourers and hone&s;t mecha|nics in their peaceful occupations. I have at
length, with great pains and expence of thought, hit upon a Scheme which will
effectually an&s;wer that end; and without further preface &s;hall lay it
before the world.</P>
<P>I WOULD propo&s;e, that every u&s;ele&s;s member of the
com|munity &s;hould be made of &s;ervice to his country, by being obliged to
climb the ropes, or carry a mu&s;quet; and every detrimental one &s;hould be
prevented from injuring his coun|trymen, and &s;ent to annoy the common enemy.
To begin with the country. There is no occa&s;ion to rob the fields of their
hu&s;bandmen, or to fetch our &s;oldiers, as the <HI>Romans</HI> took their
Dictator, from the plough. It is well known, that every county can &s;upply us
with numerous recruits, if we were to rai&s;e them out of that idle body called
Country Squires; many of whom are born only for the de&s;truction of game, and
di&s;turbance of their neighbours, They are mere vegetables, which grow up and
rot on the &s;ame &s;pot of ground; except a few which are tran&s;planted 
<PB N="345" REF="352"> into the Parliament Hou&s;e. Their whole life is hurried
away in &s;campering after foxes, leaping five-bar gates, trampling upon the
farmers corn, and &s;willing October. As they are by their profe&s;&s;ion
excellent mark&s;men, and have been u&s;ed to carry a gun, they might employ
their powder to more purpo&s;e in fetching down a Frenchman than a phea&s;ant:
and mo&s;t of them might be incorporated among Cavalry, or formed into
light-bodied troops, and mounted on their own Hunters. They might al&s;o be of
great u&s;e in maroding or getting in forage; and if they would follow an enemy
with the &s;ame alacrity and defiance of danger, as a fox, they might do great
execution in a pur&s;uit. The greate&s;t danger would be, that if a fox
&s;hould perchance cro&s;s them in their march, they would be tempted to run
from their colours for the &s;ake of a chace; and we &s;hould have them all
de&s;ert, or (in the language of fox-hunters) <HI>gone away.</HI></P>
<P>IF the country is infe&s;ted with the&s;e u&s;ele&s;s and
obnoxious animals, called Squires, this metropolis is no le&s;s over-run with a
&s;et of idle and mi&s;chievous creatures, which we may call Town Squires. We
might &s;oon levy a very numerous army, were we to enli&s;t into it every
vagrant about town, who, not having any lawful calling, from thence takes upon
him&s;elf the title of gentleman, and adds an <HI>E&s;quire</HI> to his name. A
very large <HI>corps</HI> too might be formed from the Students at the Inns of
Court, who under the pretence of following the law, receive, as it were, a
&s;anction for doing nothing at all. With the&s;e the &s;everal tribes of
play-hou&s;e and coffee-hou&s;e Critics, and that collective body of them,
called the TOWN, may be allowed to rank: And though no great exploits can be
expected from the&s;e <HI>Invalids,</HI> yet (as they are of no other u&s;e
whatever) they may at lea&s;t &s;erve in the army, like <HI>Fal&s;taff</HI>'s
men, as 
<Q REND="inline">"food for powder."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="346" REF="353">BUT a very formidable troop might be
compo&s;ed of that part of them, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Bloods. The
fury of their a&s;&s;aults on drawers and watchmen, and the &s;pirit
di&s;played in &s;torming a bagnio, would be of infinite &s;ervice in the field
of battle. But I would recommend it to the General, to have them &s;trictly
di&s;ciplined; le&s;t they &s;hould &s;hoot &s;ome of their own comrades, or
perhaps run away, merely for the &s;ake of the joke. Under proper regu|lations
&s;uch valiant gentlemen would certainly be of u&s;e. I had lately &s;ome
thoughts of recommending to the Ju&s;tices, to li&s;t the Bloods among tho&s;e
brave, re&s;olute fellows em|ployed as Thief-takers. But they may now &s;erve
nobler purpo&s;es in the army: And what may we not expect from &s;uch intrepid
heroes, who for want of opportunity to exert their prowe&s;s in warlike
&s;kirmi&s;hes abroad, have been obli|ged to vent their courage by breaking the
peace at home?</P>
<P>EVERY one will agree with me, that tho&s;e Men of Ho|nour, who
make fighting their bu&s;ine&s;s, and cannot let their &s;words re&s;t quietly
in their &s;cabbards, &s;hould be obli|ged to draw them in the &s;ervice of His
Maje&s;ty. What might we not expect from the&s;e furious
<HI>Drawcan&s;irs,</HI> if, in&s;tead of cutting one another's throats, their
&s;kill in arms was properly turned again&s;t the enemy. A very little
di&s;ci|pline would make them admirable &s;oldiers: for (as <HI>Mercutio</HI>
&s;ays) they are already 
<Q REND="inline">"the very butchers of a &s;ilk button."</Q> I
have known one of the&s;e Duelli&s;ts, to keep his hand in, employ him&s;elf
every morning in thru&s;ting at a bit of pa|per &s;tuck again&s;t the
wain&s;coat; and I have heard another boa&s;t, that he could &s;nuff a candle
with his pi&s;tol. The&s;e gentlemen are, therefore, very fit to be employed in
clo&s;e engagements: But it will be nece&s;&s;ary to keep them in continual
action; for otherwi&s;e they would breed a kind of <PB N="347" REF="354"> civil
war among&s;t them&s;elves, and, rather than not fight at all, turn their
weapons upon one another.</P>
<P>SEVERAL <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Brigades, not inferior to tho&s;e of
the &s;ame country in the Service of the <HI>French</HI> King, may be formed
out of tho&s;e able bodied men, which are called Fortune-Hunters. The attacks
of the&s;e dauntle&s;s heroes have, in|deed, been chiefly levelled at the other
&s;ex: but employ|ment may be found for the&s;e amourous knight-errants,
&s;uit|able to their known firmne&s;s and intrepidity; particularly in taking
places by &s;torm, where there is a nece&s;&s;ity for ravi&s;h|ing virgins, and
committing outrages upon the women.</P>
<P>But among the many u&s;ele&s;s members of &s;ociety, there are
none &s;o unprofitable as the fraternity of Game&s;ters. I therefore, think
that their time would be much better em|ployed in handling a mu&s;quet, than in
&s;huffling a pack of cards or &s;haking the dice-box. As to the Sharpers, it
is a pity that the &s;ame dexterity, which enables them to palm an ace or cog a
die, is not u&s;ed by them in going through the manual exerci&s;e in the
military way. The&s;e latter might, indeed, be employed as marines, and
&s;tationed in the <HI>We&s;t Indies</HI>; as many of them have already cro&s;t
the &s;eas, and are perfectly well acquainted with the Plantations.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t propo&s;al which I have to make on this &s;ubject, is
to take the whole body of Feeethinkers into the &s;ervice. For this purpo&s;e I
would impre&s;s all the members of the <HI>Robin-Hood</HI> Society; and in
con&s;ideration of his great merit, I would advi&s;e, that the
<HI>Clare-Market</HI> Orator &s;hould be made chaplain to the regiment. One of
the favourite tenets of a Freethinker is, that all men are in a natural &s;tate
of warfare with each other: nothing therefore is &s;o proper 
<PB N="348" REF="355"> for him, as to be actually engaged in war. As he has no
&s;queami&s;h notions about what will become of him hereafter, he can have no
fears about death: I would, therefore, always have the Freethinkers put upon
the mo&s;t dangerous exploits, expo&s;ed to the greate&s;t heat of battle, and
&s;ent upon the Forlorn Hope. For, &s;ince they confe&s;s that they are born
into the world for no end whatever, and that they will be nothing after death,
it is but ju&s;tice that they &s;hould be <HI>annihilated</HI> for the good of
their country.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>March</HI> 3,

<SALUTE>DEAR COUSIN!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I WAS greatly entertained with your late reflec|tions on the
&s;everal branches of magic made u&s;e of in the affairs of love. I have
my|&s;elf been very lately among the Seeers of Vi&s;ions and Dreamers of
Dreams: and hope you will not be di&s;plea&s;ed at an account of portents and
progno&s;tics full as extravagant, though they are not all owing to the &s;ame
cau&s;e, as tho&s;e of your corre&s;pondent Mi&s;s <HI>Arabella Whim&s;ey.</HI>
You mu&s;t know, Cou&s;in, that I am ju&s;t returned from a vi&s;it of a
fortnight to an old aunt <PB N="350" REF="357"> in the North; where I was
mightily diverted with the tra|ditional &s;uper&s;titions, which are mo&s;t
religiou&s;ly pre&s;erved in the family, as they have been delivered down, time
out of mind, from their &s;agacious grandmothers.</P>
<P>WHEN I arrived, I found the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e very
bu&s;ily employed with her two daughters in nailing an hor&s;e|&s;hoe to the
thre&s;hold of the door. This they told me, was to guard again&s;t the
&s;piteful de&s;igns of an old woman, who was a witch, and had threatened to do
the family a mi&s;|chief, becau&s;e one of my young cou&s;ins laid two &s;traws
acro&s;s, to &s;ee if the old hag could walk over them. The young lady
her&s;elf a&s;&s;ured me, that &s;he had &s;everal times heard Goody
<HI>Cripple</HI> muttering to her&s;elf; and to be &s;ure &s;he was &s;aying
the Lord's Prayer backwards. Be&s;ides, the old woman had very often a&s;ked
them for a pin: but they took care never to give her any thing that was
&s;harp, becau&s;e &s;he &s;hould not bewitch them. They afterwards told me
many other particulars of this kind, the &s;ame as are men|tioned, with
infinite humour by the SPECTATOR: and to confirm them, they a&s;&s;ured me,
that the elde&s;t Mi&s;s, when &s;he was little, u&s;ed to have fits, till the
mother flung a knife at another old witch, (whom the devil had carried off in a
high wind) and fetched blood from her.</P>
<P>WHEN I was to go to bed, my aunt made a thou&s;and apologies
for not putting me in the be&s;t room in the hou&s;e, which &s;he &s;aid had
never been lain in, &s;ince the death of an old wa&s;her-woman, who walked
every night, and haunted that room in particular. They fancied that the old
woman had hid money &s;omewhere, and could not re&s;t till &s;he had told
&s;omebody; and my cou&s;in a&s;&s;ured me, that &s;he might have had it all to
her&s;elf, for the &s;pirit came one night to her bed-&s;ide, and wanted to
tell her, but &s;he had not cou|rage <PB N="351" REF="358"> to &s;peak to it. I
learned al&s;o that they had a footman once, who hanged him&s;elf for love; and
he walked for a great while, till they got the par&s;on to lay him in the Red
Sea.</P>
<P>I HAD not been here long, when an accident happened, which
very much alarmed the whole family. <HI>Towzer</HI> one night howled mo&s;t
terribly; which was a &s;ure &s;ign, that &s;omebody belonging to them would
die. The younge&s;t Mi&s;s declared that &s;he had heard the hen crow that
morn|ing; which was another fatal progno&s;tic. They told me, that ju&s;t
before uncle died, <HI>Towzer</HI> howled &s;o for &s;everal nights together,
that they could not quiet him; and my aunt heard the death-watch tick as
plainly as if there had been a clock in the room: the maid too, who &s;at up
with him, heard a bell toll at the top of the &s;tairs, the very moment the
breath went out of his body. During this di&s;cour&s;e, I overheard one of my
cou&s;ins whi&s;per the other, that &s;he was afraid their mamma would not live
long; for &s;he &s;melt an ugly &s;mell, like a dead body. They had a
dairy-maid, who died the very week after an hear&s;e had &s;topt at their door
in its way to church; and the elde&s;t mi&s;s, when &s;he was but thirteen,
&s;aw her own brother's gho&s;t, (who was gone the <HI>We&s;t-Indies)</HI>
walking in the garden; and to be &s;ure nine months after, they had an account,
that he died on board the &s;hip, the very &s;ame day, and hour of the day,
that Mi&s;s &s;aw his apparition.</P>
<P>I NEED not mention to you the common incidents, which were
accounted by them no le&s;s prophetic. If a cinder popped from the fire, they
were in ha&s;te to examine whether it was a pur&s;e or a coffin. They were
aware of my arrival long before I came, becau&s;e they had &s;een a &s;tranger
on the grate. The younge&s;t Mi&s;s will let nobody <PB N="352" REF="359">
u&s;e the poker but her&s;elf; becau&s;e, when &s;he &s;tirs it, it always
burns bright, which is a &s;ign &s;he will have a bright hu&s;band: and &s;he
is no le&s;s &s;ure of a good one, becau&s;e &s;he generally has ill luck at
cards. Nor is the candle le&s;s ora|cular than the fire: for the &s;quire of
the pari&s;h came one night to pay them a vi&s;it, when the tallow
winding-&s;heet pointed towards him, and he broke his neck &s;oon after in a
fox-cha&s;e. My aunt one night ob&s;erved with great plea&s;ure a letter in the
candle; and &s;he hoped it would be from her &s;on in <HI>London.</HI> We knew,
when a &s;pirit was in the room, by the candle burning blue: but poor cou&s;in
<HI>Nancy</HI> was ready to cry one time, when &s;he &s;nuffed it out and could
not blow it in again, though her &s;i&s;ter did it at a whiff.</P>
<P>WE had no occa&s;ion for an almanack or the weather|gla&s;s,
to let us know whether it would rain or &s;hine. One evening I propo&s;ed to
ride out with my cou&s;ins the next day to &s;ee a gentleman's hou&s;e in the
neigbourhood; but my aunt a&s;&s;ured us it would be wet, &s;he knew very well
from the &s;hooting of her corn. Be&s;ides, there was a great &s;pider crawling
up the chimney, and the blackbird in the kitchen began to &s;ing: which were
both of them as certain forerunners of rain. But the mo&s;t to be depended on
in the&s;e ca&s;es is a tabby cat, which is u&s;ually ba&s;king on the parlour
hearth. If the cat turned her tail to the fire, we were to have a hard fro&s;t:
if &s;he licked her tail, rain would certainly en&s;ue. They wondered what
&s;tranger they &s;hould &s;ee; becau&s;e Pu&s;s wa&s;hed her foot over her
left ear. The old lady complained of a cold, and her daughter remarked, it
would go through the family; for &s;he ob&s;erved that poor <HI>Tab</HI> had
&s;neezed &s;everal times. Poor <HI>Tab</HI> however once flew at one of my
cou&s;ins; for which &s;he had like to have been de&s;troyed, as the whole
family began to think &s;he was no other than a witch.</P>
<P><PB N="353" REF="360">IT is impo&s;&s;ible to tell you the
&s;everal tokens, by which they know whether good or ill luck will happen to
them. Spilling of &s;alt, or laying knives acro&s;s, are every where ac|counted
ill omens; but a pin with the head turned towards you, or to be followed by a
&s;trange dog, I found were very lucky. I heard one of my cou&s;ins tell the
cookmaid, that &s;he boiled away all her &s;weethearts, becau&s;e &s;he had let
her di&s;hwater boil over. The &s;ame young lady one morn|ing came down to
breakfa&s;t with her cap the wrong &s;ide out; which the mother ob&s;erving,
charged her not to alter it all the day, for fear &s;he &s;hould turn luck.</P>
<P>BUT, above all, I could not help remarking the various
progno&s;tics, which the old lady and her daughters u&s;ed to collect from
almo&s;t every part of the body. A white &s;peck upon the nails made them as
&s;ure of a gift, as if they had it already in their pockets. The elde&s;t
&s;i&s;ter is to have one hu&s;band more than the younge&s;t, becau&s;e &s;he
has one wrin|kle more in her forehead; but the other will have the ad|vantage
of her in the number of children, as was plainly proved by &s;napping their
finger-joints. It would take up too much room, to &s;et down every
circum&s;tance which I ob&s;er|ved of this &s;ort during my &s;tay with them: I
&s;hall therefore conclude my letter with the &s;everal remarks on the re&s;t
of the body, as far as I could learn them from this prophetic family: for as I
was a relation, you know, they had le&s;s re&s;erve.</P>
<P>IF the head itches, it is a &s;ign of rain. If the head aches,
it is a profitable pain. If you have the tooth-ach, you don't love true. If
your eye-brow itches, you will &s;ee a &s;tranger. If your right eye itches,
you will cry; if your left you will laugh. If your no&s;e itches, you will
&s;hake hands, ki&s;s a fool, drink a gla&s;s of wine, run again&s;t a 
<PB N="354" REF="361"> cuckold's door, or mi&s;s them all four. If your right
ear or cheek burns, your left friends are talking of you; if your left, your
right friends are talking of you. If your elbow itches, you will change your
bedfellow. If your right hand itches, you will pay away money; if your left,
you will receive. If your &s;tomach itches, you will eat pudding. If your
gar|tering-place itches, you will go to a &s;trange place. If your back itches,
butter will be cheap when gra&s;s grows there. If your &s;ide itches,
&s;omebody is wi&s;hing for you. If your knee itches, you will kneel in a
&s;trange church: If your foot, you will tread upon &s;trange ground. La&s;tly,
if you &s;hiver, &s;ome body is walking over your grave.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>TEA-TABLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>_SO, Madam&mdash;the&s;e are fine hours, I mu&s;t
confe&s;s! It is now pa&s;t four o'clock; and you and your companions have been
making &s;uch a racket here, all &s;ober people mu&s;t cry out &s;hame upon
you. I wonder what plea&s;ure it can be for fifty or an hundred per&s;ons to
meet together and employ the whole night at Cribbage, Brag, and Whi&s;t. For my
part, I am &s;ure I had rather live in an <PB N="356" REF="363"> herb-cellar,
and entertain wa&s;herwomen over their half-quarterns of bohea with a gla&s;s
of gin between every cup, than lead &s;uch an irregular life as you do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARD-TABLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I, Madam, had rather live in a filthy ale-hou&s;e,
and be poi&s;oned with the grea&s;y cards of porters and car|men, than lead
&s;uch an in&s;ipid life as you do. You are, indeed, the delight of city-wives
and maid &s;ervants: but I ble&s;s my &s;tars, I am care&s;&s;ed by per&s;ons
of the fir&s;t rank and fa&s;hion, and am known to keep the be&s;t company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TEA-TABLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, if the truth was known, you have no rea&s;on to
boa&s;t much of your company. Is it not notorious that you entertain the very
wor&s;t of people? People that want common hone&s;ty, cheats of Quality, and
Right Honour|able &s;harpers. Who had you this night with you?&mdash;There was
my Lord &mdash;, and Lady &mdash;, and Sir <HI>John &mdash;.</HI> The&s;e,
Indeed, are your per&s;ons of the fir&s;t rank and fa&s;hion: but, to &s;peak
the truth, they are no better than pick-pockets.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARD-TABLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't wonder you &s;hould grow &s;o abu&s;ive, as
your ta|lent for &s;candal has always been remarkable. But pray, Madam, &s;ince
you talk of company, what &s;ort of people are your particular cronies? You are
plea&s;ed to upbraid me with conniving at &s;harpers: and I am &s;ure you
a&s;&s;ociate with vile pimps and go-betweens. Who are they that u&s;ually
compo&s;e your morning-levee? A milliner perhaps, or a mantua-maker, or a
<HI>French</HI> hair-cutter: and the&s;e &s;ort of gentry, you mu&s;t own, are
very commode in carrying on other bu&s;ine&s;s be&s;ides what they profe&s;s.
Nay did not <PB N="357" REF="364"> you admit Captain &mdash; the other morning
to a private <HI>t&ecirc;te &agrave; t&eacute;te</HI> conver&s;ation with the
lady of this hou&s;e, and in her very bed-chamber?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TEA-TABLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>For that la&s;t vi&s;iter I mu&s;t own my&s;elf
obliged to you, Madam. The <HI>Debt of Honour,</HI> as you call it, in which
you had involved her lady&s;hip over night, they thought fit to cancel the next
morning. And give me leave to tell you, Madam, that &s;ince the ladies have
&s;o much frequented your company, many of them have been fir&s;t cheated of
their money, and afterwards cajoled out of their virtue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CARD-TABLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is always your way&mdash;your whole delight is in
abu&s;ing other people, propagating malicious tales, and &s;lan|dering
reputations. But remember what the Poet &s;ays, 
<Q> 
<L>Who &s;teals my <HI>pur&s;e</HI> &s;teals
tra&s;h&mdash;</L> 
<L>But he who filches from me my <HI>good name,</HI>
&amp;c.</L></Q> The lines are very common, I need not repeat them to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TEA-TABLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>If they had not been very common, and taken out of a
play be&s;ides, I &s;hould have wondered to hear you quote them. For who can be
more illiterate than your friends and acquaintance? <HI>Hoyle</HI>'s Treati&s;e
on Whi&s;t is almo&s;t the only book they have ever read: and as the mind of
man, before it has received any ideas, has been compared to a white &s;heet of
paper, we may &s;ay that a game&s;ter's mind is. a mere pack of cards, and has
no impre&s;&s;ions beyond the pips and the Four Honours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="358" REF="365">
<SPEAKER>CARD-TABLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be &s;ure, Madam, I mu&s;t acknowledge your
&s;uperior under&s;tanding; you have &s;uch prodigious opportunities of
improving your&s;elf! Can any thing, for in&s;tance, be &s;o plea|&s;ant and
in&s;tructive as your chit-chats and go&s;&s;ipings with the good city-wives
over their <HI>di&s;turbed</HI> tea and a huge plate of bread and butter!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TEA-TABLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But can any thing be &s;o in&s;ipid (to &s;ay no
wor&s;e of it) as the polite jargon, which makes up the whole of your
conver&s;ation over a pack of cards! In this, indeed, you put tho&s;e of the
highe&s;t rank and &s;en&s;e upon a level with the lowe&s;t and mo&s;t ignorant
of the vulgar; for game&s;ters have the &s;ame language whether in an
alehou&s;e or a draw|ing-room: and I would as &s;oon li&s;ten to a &s;et of
draymen &s;quabbling about their half-pence at All-Fours and One-and-Thirty, as
to the club at <HI>White</HI>'s wrangling for thou|&s;ands. The talk of either
party is altogether confined to their different games; and if the genteel
game&s;ter, upon every turn of the cards again&s;t him, damns him&s;elf with a
good grace, the drayman bluntly pours out a volley of the &s;ame oaths. But I
&s;hould not &s;o much quarrel with you for having &s;educed the men, if you
had not &s;o &s;trangely in|fatuated the ladies, who &s;eem more particularly
de&s;igned for my company. I am now looked upon as a mere in|cumbrance; and
they think every moment that is lo&s;t upon me, very tedious, while it detains
them from your refined plea&s;ures. The women of this country u&s;ed to be
admired for their virtues as well as their beauty: but &s;ince you have
engro&s;&s;ed &s;o much of their time and thoughts, at the &s;ame time that you
have &s;poiled their faces, you have corrupted their morals.</P>

<SPEAKER>CARD-TABLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Their morals, Madam!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TEA-TABLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know you make a je&s;t of morality; and every other
con&s;ideration gives way, when once the love of play is predominant. For
example;&mdash;What an alteration have you made in the lady of this hou&s;e? I

<P>_IT is ob&s;erved by the <HI>French</HI> that a Cat, a Prie&s;t,
and an Old Woman are &s;ufficient to con&s;titute a religious Sect in
<HI>England.</HI> So univer&s;ally it &s;eems, are learning and genius
diffu&s;ed through this i&s;land, that the lowe&s;t plebeians are deep
ca&s;ui&s;ts in matters of faith as well as po|litics: and &s;o many and
wonderful are the new lights con|tinually breaking in upon us, that we daily
make fre&s;h di&s;coveries, and &s;trike out unbeaten paths to future
hap|pine&s;s. The above ob&s;ervation of our neighbours is in truth rather too
full: for a prie&s;t is &s;o far from nece&s;&s;ary, that a new &s;pecies of
doctrine would be better received by our old women, and other well di&s;po&s;ed
good people, from a layman. The mo&s;t extraordinary tenets of religion are
very &s;uccesfully propagated under the &s;anction of the lea|thern apron
in&s;tead of the ca&s;&s;ock: Every corner of the town has a barber, ma&s;on,
bricklayer, or &s;ome other handi|craft <PB N="362" REF="369"> teacher: and
there are almo&s;t as many &s;ects in this metropolis as there are pari&s;h
churches.</P>
<P>AS to the Old Women, &s;ince the pa&s;&s;ions of females are
&s;tronger in youth, and their minds weaker in age, than tho&s;e of the other
&s;ex, their readine&s;s in embracing any principles of religion pre&s;&s;ed on
them with particular earne&s;t|ne&s;s and vehemence, is not very wonderful.
They hope, by the mo&s;t rigid demeanor in the decline of life, to make amends
for that unbounded loo&s;e given to their pa&s;&s;ions in their younger years.
The &s;ame violence however, com|monly accompanies them in religion, as
formerly actuated them in their plea&s;ures; and their zeal entirely eats up
their charity. They look with a malevolent kind of pity on all who are &s;till
employed in <HI>worldly</HI> undertakings, 
<Q REND="inline">"carry prayer books in their pockets,"</Q> and
piou&s;ly damn all their relations and acquaintance with texts of &s;cripture.
I know an old gentlewoman of this ca&s;t who has formed her&s;elf as a pattern
of &s;taid behaviour, and values her&s;elf for having given up at three&s;core
the vanities of &s;ixteen. She denounces heavy judgments on all frequenters of
public diver&s;ions, and forebodes the wor&s;t con&s;equences from every party
of plea&s;ure. I have known her foretell the ruin of her niece from a country
dance: nay, &s;he can perceive irregular de&s;ires flaming from a gay coloured
topknot, and has even de&s;cried adultery it&s;elf lurking beneath the thin
veil of a worked apron, or beaming from a diamond girdle-buckle.</P>
<P>BUT we might perhaps &s;uffer a few good Old Ladies to go to
heaven their own way, if the&s;e Sects were not per|nicious on many other
accounts. Such &s;trange doctrines are wonderfully apt to un&s;ettle the minds
of the common people, who often make an odd tran&s;ition from infidelity to
enthu&s;ia&s;m, and become bigots from arrant freethinkers: Their faith
however, it may be well imagined, is not a &s;aving faith; as they are worked
up to an adoration of the CREATOR, from the &s;ame &s;lavi&s;h principle that
induces <PB N="363" REF="370"> the <HI>Indians</HI> to wor&s;hip the Devil. It
is amazing how &s;trongly fear operates on the&s;e weak creatures, and how
ea&s;ily a canting, whining ra&s;cal can mould them to his purpo&s;e. I have
known many a rich trade&s;man wheedled and threatned out of his
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and him&s;elf and unhappy family at la&s;t lectured into the
work-hou&s;e. Thus do the&s;e vile hypocrites turn a poor convert's head to
&s;ave his &s;oul; and deprive him of all happine&s;s in this world, under
pre|tence of &s;ecuring it to him eternally in the next.</P>
<P>NOTHING can do religion more injury than the&s;e &s;olemn
mockeries of it. Many of the&s;e Sects con&s;i&s;t almo&s;t entirely of
battered pro&s;titutes, and per&s;ons of the mo&s;t infamous character.
Reformation is their chief pretence; wherefore the more abandoned tho&s;e are
of whom they make pro&s;elytes, the more they pride them&s;elves on their
conver&s;ion. I remember a debauched young fellow, who pretended a &s;udden
amendment of his principles, in order to repair his &s;hattered fortune. He
turned Methodi&s;t, and &s;oon began to manife&s;t a kind of &s;piritual
fondne&s;s for a pious &s;i&s;ter. He wooed her according to the directions of
the rubric, &s;ent her &s;ermons in&s;tead of billet-doux, 
<Q REND="inline">"greeted her with a holy ki&s;s,"</Q> and
obtained his mi&s;tre&s;s by appearing in every re&s;pect a thorough devotee.
But alas! the good gen|tleman could never be prevailed on to comply with
religious ordinances, or appear any more at church or meeting, after the
performance of the marriage-ceremony. The lowe&s;t of the vulgar al&s;o, for
their peculiar ends, frequently be|come &s;ectaries. They avail them&s;elves of
a mock conver|&s;ion to redeem their lo&s;t characters, and, like criminals at
<HI>Rome,</HI> make the church a &s;anctuary for villainy. By this artifice
they recommend them&s;elves to the charity of weak but well-meaning
Chri&s;tians, and often in&s;inuate them&s;elves as &s;ervants into Methodi&s;t
families.</P>
<P>LE SAGE, with his u&s;ual humour, repre&s;ents <HI>Gil Blas</HI>
as wonderfully charmed with the &s;eeming &s;anctity of <HI>Am|bro&s;e de
Lamela,</HI> when he took him into his &s;ervice: and <PB N="364" REF="371">
<HI>Gil Blas</HI> is even not offended at his remi&s;&s;ne&s;s the very fir&s;t
night, when his new &s;ervant tells him that it was owing to his attending his
devotions. But it &s;oon appears that this &s;ly valet had been employed in
concerting the robbery of his ma&s;ter. A due attention to religion is &s;o
rare a quality in all ranks of people, that I am far from blaming it in
&s;ervants; but when I &s;ee their religion &s;hewing it&s;elf in lazine&s;s,
and ob&s;erve them neglecting their common bu|&s;ine&s;s under the pretext of
performing acts of &s;upererogation, I am apt to que&s;tion their &s;incerity,
and to take every &s;er|vant of that kind for a mere Saint <HI>Ambro&s;e.</HI>
An old <HI>Mora|vian</HI> aunt of mine, of whom I have formerly made worthy
mention, would never have any &s;ervants, who did not be|long to the &s;ociety
of the United Brethren. But &s;o little did the good lady's endeavours to
pre&s;erve good order and a &s;pirit of devotion in her hou&s;e &s;ucceed; that
the generality of the men fell into evil cour&s;es, and mo&s;t of the pious
&s;i&s;terhood left the family with big bellies.</P>
<P>I WOULD not be thought to deny my fellow-&s;ubjects full liberty
of con&s;cience, and all the benefits of the Toleration-Act; yet I cannot help
regarding the&s;e weak, if not ill-meant divi&s;ions from the e&s;tabli&s;hed
church as a dangerous kind of Freethinking: not &s;o &s;hocking indeed as the
impious avowal of athei&s;m and infidelity, but often attended with the &s;ame
bad con&s;equences. A religion founded on mad|ne&s;s and enthu&s;ia&s;m, is
almo&s;t as bad as no religion at all; and what is wor&s;t, the unhappy errors
of particular &s;ects expo&s;e the pure&s;t religion in the world to the
&s;coffs of un|believers. Shallow witlings exerci&s;e their little talents for
ridicule on matters of religion, and fall into athei&s;m and bla&s;phemy in
order to avoid bigotry and enthu&s;ia&s;m. The weakne&s;s of the &s;ectaries
&s;trengthen them in their ridiculous notions, and produce many other evils, as
will appear from the following &s;hort hi&s;tory.</P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="372">IN the glorious reign of Queen
<HI>Elizabeth</HI> there re&s;ided in the&s;e kingdoms a worthy lady called
RELIGION. She was remarkable for the &s;weetne&s;s of her temper; which was
chearful without levity, and grave without moro&s;ene&s;s. She was al&s;o
particularly decent in her dre&s;s as well as behaviour, and pre&s;erved with
uncommon mildne&s;s the &s;tricte&s;t regularity in her family. Though &s;he
had a noble genius, and led a very &s;ober life, yet in tho&s;e days &s;he kept
the be&s;t company, was greatly admired by the Queen, and was even intimate
with mo&s;t of the maids of honour. What became of her and her family is not
known, but it is very certain that they have at pre|&s;ent no connection with
the polite world. Some affirm that the line is extinct; though I have indeed
been told that the late Bi&s;hop <HI>Berkley</HI> and the pre&s;ent Bi&s;hops
of &mdash; and &mdash; de|&s;cended from principal branches of it, and that
&s;ome few of the &s;ame family are re&s;ident on &s;mall livings in the
country.</P>
<P>WE are told by a certain fa&s;hionable author, that there were
formerly two men in a madhou&s;e at <HI>Paris,</HI> one of whom imagined
him&s;elf <HI>The</HI> FATHER, and the other <HI>The</HI> SON. In like manner,
no &s;ooner did the good lady RELIGION di&s;appear, but &s;he was per&s;onated
by a crazy old beldam called SUPER|STITION. But the cheat was in&s;tantly
di&s;covered; for in&s;tead of the mild di&s;cipline with which her
predece&s;&s;or ruled her family, &s;he governed entirely by &s;everity, racks,
wheels, gib|bets, &s;word, fire and faggot. In&s;tead of chearfulne&s;s &s;he
introduced gloom, was perpetually cro&s;&s;ing her&s;elf with holy water, and,
to avert the terrible judgments of which &s;he was hourly in fear, &s;he
compiled a new almanack, in which &s;he wonderfully multiplied the number of
red letters. After a mi&s;erable life &s;he died melancholy-mad, but left a
will be|hind her, in which &s;he left a very con&s;iderable &s;um to build an
ho&s;pital for religious lunatics; which I am informed, will &s;peedily be
built on the &s;ame ground, where the Foundery, the celebrated Methodi&s;t
meeting-hou&s;e, now &s;tands.</P>
<P>SUPERSTITION left behind her a &s;on called ATHEISM, begot on
her by a <HI>Moravian</HI> teacher at one of their Love-Fea&s;ts. ATHEISM
&s;oon &s;hewed him&s;elf to be a mo&s;t profli|gate <PB N="366" REF="373">
abandoned fellow. He came very early upon town, and was a remarkable Blood.
Among his other frolicks he turned author, and is &s;aid to have written in
concert with Lord <HI>Bolingbroke.</HI> After having &s;quandered a large
fortune, he turned game&s;ter, then pimp, and then highwayman; in which la&s;t
occupation he was &s;oon detected, taken, and thrown into <HI>Newgate.</HI> He
behaved very impudently in the Condemned Hole, abu&s;ed the Ordinary whenever
that gen|tleman attended him, and encouraged all his fellow pri&s;oners, in the
<HI>Newgate</HI> phra&s;e, to die hard. When he came to the gallows, in&s;tead
of the p&s;alm he &s;ung a bawdy catch, threw away the book, and bid <HI>Jack
Ketch</HI> tuck him up like a gen|tleman. Many of his relations were pre&s;ent
at the execution, and &s;hook their heads repeating the words of <HI>Mat</HI>
in the <HI>Beggar's Opera,</HI>

<Q><TEXT LANG="eng">
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="speech">
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is with no le&s;s &s;urpri&s;e than concern, that I reflect
on the danger to which the greater part of my &s;ex, either through ignorance
or choice, are now expo&s;ed; and <PB N="368" REF="375"> I have the
&s;tronge&s;t rea&s;ons to believe, that nothing but the vigorous and timely
Re&s;olutions of this wi&s;e A&s;&s;embly can prevent them from changing their
religion, and becoming ROMAN CATHOLICS. What &s;ubject can be more
intere&s;t|ing and important to Us, whether we con&s;ider our&s;elves as a
Committee of Religion, a Parliament of Women, or an A&s;&s;embly of
Prote&s;tants? Was &s;uch a de&s;ign to be carried into execution, the free
u&s;e of our tongues would be taken away; we &s;hould never be &s;uffered
perhaps to &s;peak to the other &s;ex but through grates and bars, and this
place of our A&s;&s;embly would be probably the abode of Nuns and Fryars. But
lea&s;t you &s;hould think me thus alarmed without rea&s;on, I &s;hall now lay
before you the grounds of my complaint; that, if it is not too late we may
correct the evil, or if it is we may guard again&s;t it.</P>
<P>MY fears are grounded on tho&s;e remarks, that have long been
made on the Dre&s;s of the &s;ex. Con&s;tant as the men have &s;tiled us to the
love of change, little have they ima|gined, that Popery was invariably the
object to which every innovation was de&s;igned to lead. So long ago as when,
to the honour of our &s;ex, a Queen was upon the throne, it was the fa&s;hion,
as we may learn from <HI>Pope,</HI> for the ladies to wear upon their brea&s;ts
a flaming CROSS. The &s;ame fa&s;hion has been tran&s;mitted to the pre&s;ent
times. What, Madam, is this but downright Popery? In the Catholic countries
they are contented with erecting Crucifixes in their roads and churches; but
alas! in this Prote&s;tant kingdom Cro&s;&s;es are alike to be &s;een in places
&s;acred and profane, the court, the playhou&s;e, and (pardon me ladies!) this
venera|ble A&s;&s;embly it&s;elf is not without them. I am apt to &s;u&s;pect,
that this heterodox introduction of the Cro&s;s into the female dre&s;s had an
higher original, than the days of Queen <HI>Ann,</HI> <PB N="369" REF="376">
who&s;e affection for the Church, was very well known. It &s;eems rather to
have been imported among us, together with the <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> by the
Popi&s;h Con&s;orts of the fir&s;t or &s;econd <HI>Charles</HI>: or perhaps the
ladies fir&s;t wore it in com|plai&s;ance to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pope
<HI>Joan,</HI> Queen <HI>Mary.</HI> This much is certain, that at the &s;ame
time our pious Reformer Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> expelled the Cro&s;s from our
altars, &s;he effectually &s;ecured the necks of our ladies from this
&s;uper|&s;tition by the introduction of the Ruff.</P>
<P>THE next part of our dre&s;s that I &s;hall mention, which
favours of Popery, is the CAPUCHIN. This garment in truth has a near
re&s;emblance to that of the Fryar, who&s;e name it bears. Our grandmothers had
already adopted the HOOD, their daughters by a gradual advance introduced the
re&s;t, but far greater improvements were &s;till in &s;tore for Us. We all of
us remember, for it is not above two years ago, how all colours were neglected
for that of PURPLE. In Purple we glowed from the hat to the &s;hoe, and in
&s;uch reque&s;t were the ribbons and &s;ilks of that favourite colour, that
neither the milliner, mercer, nor dyer him&s;elf could an&s;wer the demand. Who
but mu&s;t think that this aro&s;e from Popi&s;h principles? and though it may
be urged that the admired <HI>Fanny,</HI> who fir&s;t introduced it, is no Nun,
yet you may all remember that the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> her&s;elf has been
&s;tyled, The SCARLET, or as &s;ome render it, The PURPLE WHORE.</P>
<P>BUT to prove indi&s;putably our manife&s;t approaches to
Popery, let me now refer you to that fa&s;hionable cloak, which, &s;orry I am
to &s;ee it, is wore by the far greater part even of this A&s;&s;embly, and
which indeed is with great pro|priety &s;tyled, <HI>The</HI> CARDINAL. For were
his Holine&s;s the Pope to be introduced among us, he would almo&s;t fancy 
<PB N="370" REF="377"> him&s;elf in his own Conclave: and were I not too well
ac|quainted with my &s;i&s;ters principles, I my&s;elf &s;hould be in|duced to
think, that to tho&s;e in &s;uch grave attire nothing but a cloy&s;ter and a
grate was wanting. As to tho&s;e of gayer colours, you need not be told, that
there are White and Grey Fryars abroad as well as Black: and as the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are &s;o remarkable for improving on their originals, we
&s;hall not be then &s;urprized at the variety of colours that appears among
us.</P>
<P>IT has been whi&s;pered too, that &s;ome of my &s;i&s;ters
have been &s;o fond of the Monki&s;h au&s;terities, as to have their heads
&s;haved. This I do not aver of my own knowledge; but, if it is &s;o, they
&s;till conde&s;cend to wear artificial locks, though it would not be at all
&s;trange, if they al&s;o &s;hould &s;oon be laid a&s;ide, as they are already
prepared for it by leaving off their caps. I &s;hall only de&s;ire you &s;till
farther to reflect, how fa&s;hionable it is for the ladies to &s;hine with
borrowed faces; and then I believe you will readily allow, that their votaries,
the men, are in great danger al&s;o of being &s;educed to Popery; &s;ince do
they not already, by the compliments they pay to a painted face, addre&s;s an
<HI>Image</HI> and adore a <HI>Picture?</HI></P>
<P>WHAT has now been &s;aid will induce you, I hope, to pay a
proper regard to the following Re&s;olutions, which, I humbly move, may be
agreed to by this Committee, and re|pre&s;ented to the Hou&s;e.</P>

<P>THIS Motion was &s;trongly &s;econded by Lady <HI>Mend'em,</HI>
who urged in its &s;upport, that to her certain knowledge many of the &s;ex
very frequently a&s;&s;embled at one anothers hou&s;es (and particularly on the
Sabbath) where Ma&s;s Books were actually laid before them, and the warme&s;t
adoration paid to &s;oome &s;mall Pictures or painted Images, which &s;he was
told, re&s;embled &s;ome Kings and Queens that had been long canonized. And the
Offerings that were con&s;tantly made at their Shrines would (&s;he &s;aid) be
found on a moderate computation, to exceed tho&s;e that were formerly made at
the tomb of <HI>Thomas &agrave; Becket.</HI> She added, that after the Catholic
cu&s;tom they always fa&s;ted on tho&s;e nights, or if they &s;upt at all it
was only on FISH.</P>
<P>THE chief &s;peaker on the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion was
Lady <HI>Smart,</HI> one of the repre&s;entatives for
<HI>Gro&s;venor-Square,</HI> who by the way was &s;trongly &s;u&s;pected of
being a preju|diced per&s;on, her enemies not denying that &s;he had charms,
which could almo&s;t &s;anctify error it&s;elf. Nobody, &s;he &s;aid, could
&s;u&s;pect the &s;ex of inclining to Popery, who ob&s;erved the aver&s;ion
they all di&s;covered to a &s;ingle life. The <PB N="372" REF="379"> u&s;es of
the obnoxious garments were allowed to be many; the names at lea&s;t were
innocent; and the cry again&s;t them, &s;he was &s;ure, could only be rai&s;ed
by the old and the ugly; &s;ince nothing could be &s;o fanta&s;tic, as not to
become a pretty woman.</P>
<P>HER lady&s;hip was joined by the Beauties pre&s;ent; but they
being few, their objections were over-ruled, and the Motion was carried. The
next day the Hou&s;e, on receiv|ing the report, after &s;ome debate agreed to
the Re&s;olu|tions, and a Bill was ordered to be prepared and brought in
accordingly. Though at the &s;ame time they were of opinion, <HI>Nem. Con.</HI>
that if the FIG-LEAF BILL took place, the&s;e re&s;trictions would be quite
needle&s;s.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IF you are a true &s;port&s;man, and have the honour of the
Turf at heart, you mu&s;t have ob&s;erved with the utmo&s;t concern a late
account in the news-papers, that WHITE-NOSE died at <HI>Donca&s;ter</HI> of a
mortification in his foot. An article of this nature, and at &s;uch a time,
mu&s;t &s;trike a damp on all gentlemen breeders; and for my part I cannot help
looking on the pre&s;ent races at <HI>New-Market,</HI> as funeral games in
honour of the memory of WHITE-NOSE. The death of a &s;tallion of &s;uch
con&s;e|quence is a public calamity to all knowing ones in the king|dom: nor
does &s;uch an accident bring with it the lea&s;t con|&s;olation; 
<PB N="374" REF="381"> e&s;pecially &s;ince it is not the fa&s;hion to
<HI>pit</HI> the lives of hor&s;es, as well as men, again&s;t each other.</P>
<P>ITALIAN grey-hounds, Dutch lap-dogs, monkeys, and maccaws,
have been honoured with monuments and epi|taphs: But a race-hor&s;e as much
&s;urpa&s;&s;es the&s;e in&s;ignificant animals, as WHITE-NOSE was &s;uperior
to a pack-hor&s;e: and I cannot but think, that an obeli&s;k (with a proper
in&s;crip|tion drawn up by Me&s;&s;ieurs <HI>Heber</HI> and <HI>Pond)</HI>
&s;hould be erected near the <HI>Devil's Ditch,</HI> or <HI>Choak-Jade,</HI> on
<HI>New|market Heath,</HI> in honour of his memory. With what rapture might we
then read of his <HI>powerful deep rate,</HI> by which all the hor&s;es that
ran again&s;t him were <HI>no-where</HI>; of his rapid victories in the field,
(more &s;urprizing than tho&s;e of the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,)</HI> by which
he WON <HI>Tewk&s;bury,</HI> WON <HI>Chipping-Norton,</HI> WON
<HI>Lincoln,</HI> WON <HI>York,</HI> &amp;c. But, above all, we &s;hould admire
the noble BLOOD which flowed in his veins, and with reverence contemplate the
illu&s;trious names of his great, great, great, great, great grand&s;ires and
grandams. There is not the lea&s;t <HI>flaw</HI> in the BLOOD of WHITE-NOSE's
family: and his epitaph might conclude, in imitation of that famous one on the
Duke of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI>'s monument, 
<Q REND="inline">"that all the Sons were remarkable Stallions,
and all the Daughters excel|lent Breeders."</Q></P>
<P>THE pedigrees of our race-hor&s;es have been always
pre&s;erved with as much care and exactne&s;s, as the Tree of De&s;cent among
the family of a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> grandee or <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> nobleman: nor
does the <HI>Welchman</HI> derive greater honour from proving him&s;elf the
fiftieth cou&s;in to <HI>Cadwallader</HI> or <HI>Caractacus,</HI> through a
long line of <HI>David Ap Shenkins, Ap Morgans, Ap Powells, Ap Prices,</HI>
than the hor&s;e by being <PB N="375" REF="382"> half brother to the
<HI>Godolphin Barb,</HI> or full cou&s;in by the dam's &s;ide to the <HI>Bloody
Shoulder'd Arabian.</HI> The <HI>Romans</HI> were no le&s;s curious in the
breed of their hor&s;es, and paid the greate&s;t honours to tho&s;e that beat
the whole <HI>Circus hollow.</HI> They even erectred monuments to their memory,
of which <HI>Lip&s;uis</HI> gives us the following remarkable in&s;tance.
<HI>Clari&s;&s;im&egrave; lapis vetus, quem Romae olim vidi et ex&s;crip&s;i.
In medio vir e&s;t, qui dextr&acirc; baculum, &s;ini&s;tr&acirc; pabulum tenet:
extrin&s;ecus duo &s;unt a&s;&s;ilientes equi cum gemin&acirc;
in&s;criptione</HI>;&mdash;AQUILO, <HI>Nepos Aquilonis vicit</HI> cxxx.

itaque ip&s;um h&igrave;c</HI> HIRPINUM, <HI>atque adeo ejus avum</HI>
AQUILONEM. I could wi&s;h that the &s;ame honours were paid to our hor&s;es: I
would at lea&s;t propo&s;e, that the the names, pedi|grees, and a li&s;t of the
plates won by victorious hor&s;es &s;hould be in&s;cribed on the po&s;ts of all
cour&s;es, where they have made them&s;elves famous. The&s;e memorials might
&s;erve to perpetuate the renown of our racers, and would furni&s;h po&s;terity
with a more complete hi&s;tory of the Turf than the <HI>Sport&s;man</HI>'s
<HI>Calendar.</HI></P>
<P>YOU will undoubtedly ob&s;erve, Mr. TOWN, that in the extract
concerning hor&s;es, with which I have ju&s;t pre|&s;ented you from
<HI>Lip&s;ius,</HI> a man is al&s;o mentioned; the account of whom would, if
modernized, run in the follow|ing terms. 
<Q REND="inline">"In the middle of the monument &s;tood a man,
with a whip in his right hand, and a feed of corn in his left."</Q> Hence it
appears, that the <HI>Romans</HI> intended to do honour to the charioteer as
well as the hor&s;es; and it is a pity, that we do not al&s;o imitate them in
this particular, and pay equal re&s;pect to our Jockeys. <PB N="376" REF="383">
The chariot-race was not more celebrated among the Ancients, than the
hor&s;e-race is at pre&s;ent; and the <HI>Circus</HI> at <HI>Rome</HI> never
drew together &s;o noble an a&s;&s;embly as the modern cour&s;e. Nor do I &s;ee
any rea&s;on, why <HI>Theron</HI> &s;hould be more applauded for carrying off
the prize at <HI>Elis</HI> or <HI>Pi&s;a,</HI> than <HI>Tom Mar&s;hal</HI> for
winning the plate at <HI>York</HI> or <HI>Newmarket.</HI> The charioteers of
old were, in|deed, compo&s;ed of the greate&s;t princes, and per&s;ons of the
fir&s;t rank, who prided them&s;elves on their dexterity in managing the reins,
and driving their own chariots. In this they have been imitated by &s;everal of
our mo|dern gentry, who value them&s;elves in being excellent coachmen. And it
is with infinite plea&s;ure, that I have lately ob&s;erved per&s;ons of
fa&s;hion at all races affect the dre&s;s and manner of grooms. And as
gentlemen, like the ancient charioteers, begin to enter the race them&s;elves,
and ride their own hor&s;es, it is probable that we &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee the
be&s;t jockeys among the fir&s;t of our nobility.</P>
<P>THAT the encomiums of the hor&s;e &s;hould &s;o frequently be
enlarged on, without entering into the prai&s;es of the Jockey, is indeed
&s;omething wonderful; when we con&s;ider how much the bea&s;t is under his
direction, and that the &s;trength and fleetne&s;s of <HI>Victorious</HI> or
<HI>Driver</HI> would be of no u&s;e without the &s;kill and hone&s;ty of the
rider. Large &s;ums have been lo&s;t by a hor&s;e running, accidentally without
doubt, on the wrong &s;ide of the po&s;t; and We Knowing Ones, Mr. TOWN, have
frequently &s;een great dexterity and management exerted, in contriving that
one of the be&s;t hor&s;es in the field &s;hould be di&s;tanced. The Joc|key
has indeed &s;o great a &s;hare in the &s;ucce&s;s of the race, 
<PB N="377" REF="384"> that every man, who has ever betted five pounds, is
ac|quainted with his con&s;equence, and does not want to be told, that the
victory depends at lea&s;t as often on the rider as the hor&s;e.</P>
<P>I CANNOT help agreeing with Lady <HI>Pentweazle</HI> in the
farce, that 
<Q REND="inline">"if there was as much care taken in the breed
of the human &s;pecies, as there is in that of dogs and of hor&s;es, we
&s;hould not have &s;o many puny half-formed animals as we daily &s;ee among
us:"</Q> and indeed every thorough &s;port&s;man very well knows, that as much
art is required in bringing up a Jockey, as the bea&s;t he is to ride. In every
re&s;pect the &s;ame care mu&s;t be had to keep him in wind; and he mu&s;t be
in like manner dieted, put in &s;weats, and exerci&s;ed to bring him down to a
proper weight. Much depends upon the &s;ize of the man as well as hor&s;e: for
a rider of the &s;ame dimen&s;ions with a grenadier would no more be fit to
come upon the Turf as a Jockey, than an awkward thing taken out of the &s;hafts
of a dray could ever appear at the &s;tarting-po&s;t as a race-hor&s;e. This is
obvious to every one; and I could not help &s;miling at what my landlord at the
<HI>White Bear</HI> &s;aid the other day to a fellow-commoner of <HI>St.
John</HI>'s, (who would fain be thought a Knowing One) by way of compliment: 
<Q REND="inline">"My worthy ma&s;ter, &s;aid the landlord, it
is a thou&s;and pities you &s;hould be a gown&s;man, when you would have made
&s;uch a &s;pecial po&s;tboy or jockey."</Q></P>
<P>MY chief inducement to write to you at pre&s;ent, Mr. TOWN,
was to de&s;ire you to u&s;e your endeavours to bring the Jockey into equal
e&s;teem with the animal he be&s;trides; and to beg that you would promote the
&s;ettling an e&s;ta|bli&s;hed <PB N="378" REF="385"> &s;cheme for the
pre&s;ervation of his breed. In order to this I would humbly propo&s;e, that a
&s;tud for the Jockeys &s;hould be immediately built near the &s;tables at
<HI>Newmarket,</HI> and that their genealogies &s;hould be duly regi&s;tered;
that the breed &s;hould be cro&s;&s;ed, as occa&s;ion might require; and that
the be&s;t hor&s;emen and of the lighte&s;t weights &s;hould intermarry with
the full &s;i&s;ters of tho&s;e who had won mo&s;t plates; and in a word the
&s;ame methods u&s;ed for the improve|ment of the Jockeys as their hor&s;es. I
have here &s;ent you the exact pedigree of a famous Jockey, taken with all that
care ju&s;t now pre&s;cribed; and I doubt not if my &s;cheme was univer|&s;ally
put in execution, but we &s;hould excel all other nations in our hor&s;emen, as
we already do in our hor&s;es.</P>

<P>_RETURNING the other night from the coffee|hou&s;e, where I had
ju&s;t been reading the Votes, I found my&s;elf on a &s;udden op|pre&s;&s;ed
with a drow&s;ine&s;s, that &s;eemed to promi&s;e me as &s;ound a repo&s;e in
my great chair, as my dog already enjoyed by the fire-&s;ide. I willingly
indulged it, and had hardly clo&s;ed my eyes before I fell into the following
dream.</P>
<P>METHOUGHT the door of my room on a &s;udden flew open, and
admitted a great variety of Dogs of all &s;orts and &s;izes, from the ma&s;tiff
to the lapdog. I was &s;ur|prized at this appearance, but my amazement was much
<PB N="380" REF="387"> encrea&s;ed, when I &s;aw a large Grey-hound advancing
towards me, and heard him thus addre&s;s me in a hu|man voice.</P>
<Q> 
<P> YOU cannot, Sir, be ignorant of the panic that pre|vails among
all our &s;pecies, on account of a &s;cheme now on foot for our de&s;truction.
That &s;laughter, which was formerly made among the wolves of this land, and in
which our ance&s;tors bore &s;o large a &s;hare, is now going to be revived
among us. I, for my own part, have no hopes of e&s;caping, as you will ea&s;ily
judge when you hear my ca&s;e. My ma&s;ter owes his &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence to his
labour, and with his wages can ju&s;t main|tain me and his three children. In
return, I now and then afford him a comfortable meal, by killing him a rabbit
in the &s;quire's warren, or picking him up a hare on a <HI>Sunday</HI>
morning. The other &s;ervices I render him are of equal importance to him and
plea&s;ure to my&s;elf. I am his con&s;tant companion to the field in the
morning, and back again at night: he knows that his cloaths and his wallet are
&s;afe in my keeping; and he is &s;ure to be rouzed on any midnight alarm, when
I am in the hou&s;e.</P> 
<P> IT is with horror I reflect on the numbers of my relations, who
will &s;wing their la&s;t, and again&s;t whom this law &s;eems indeed to be
levelled. Is it not enough that our merits are neglected, and thought inferior
to tho&s;e of a &s;low-footed race, who inhabit a &s;pacious ken|nel in the
&s;quire's yard, and who are as many hours in killing a hare, as we are
minutes? Yet they are kept by the great, attended by the noble, and every day
treat|ed <PB N="381" REF="388"> with hor&s;e-fle&s;h: while I live among the
poor, am threatned by the rich, and now probably &s;hall be de|&s;troyed by
public authority.</P> 
<P> I CANNOT deny, but that the favour of the ladies is frequently
extended to a &s;mall and degenerate race; who, tho' they bear our name, may
very properly be &s;tiled the <HI>Fribbles</HI> of our Species. 'Tis true, they
are of foreign extraction, which alone is &s;ufficient merit, and &s;eem indeed
to be as much preferred by the <HI>Beau Monde</HI> to our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
greyhounds, as their countrymen in the <HI>Haymarket</HI> are to our
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ingers. But tho' this breed is &s;o diminutive, that I
my&s;elf have cour&s;ed one of them for a hare, yet I will venture to
pronounce, that be the tax what it will, not a <HI>Fido</HI> in the land will
be &s;acrificed to the laws.</P> 
<P> OUR reque&s;t to you is to di&s;play our merits to the world
and convince mankind of the innocence of our intentions, and the hard&s;hips
that we already labour un|der. Though I have enlarged on my own ca&s;e; I have
the honour to addre&s;s you in the name of all my brethren; &s;uch of them, I
mean, as think them&s;elves endangered by this &s;cheme for our de&s;truction.
At the &s;ame time we de&s;ire you to apprize the Public of the hazard they may
run by coming to an open rupture; &s;ince, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, the Ma&s;tiffs
and the Bull Dogs are determined to join their forces, and will &s;ell their
lives at the deare&s;t rate.</P> </Q>
<P>THIS la&s;t re&s;olution was confirmed by a general growl. After
which I was thus acco&s;ted by another of the company, of the
Pointing-breed.</P>
<Q><PB N="382" REF="389"> 
<P> LITTLE did I think, that the pains I have taken, and the
blows I have &s;uffered, to perfect me in the art I profe&s;s, would have been
thus requited. Having lo&s;t the be&s;t of ma&s;ters by an accident from his
gun, which I can &s;carce ever think of without a howl, I have now, like my
friend <HI>Smoker,</HI> the misfortune to live with a poor man. A misfortune I
now call it, &s;ince alas! he will not be able to &s;ave me from the halter, by
paying my ran&s;om. He too, I am afraid, will be reduced to beggary; &s;ince at
pre&s;ent, I and his gun are his chief &s;upport. If he is deprived of me, and
thereby pre|vented from what the rich maliciou&s;ly term <HI>poaching,</HI> his
be&s;t re&s;ource will be to di&s;patch him&s;elf with his gun before he
&s;urrenders it, or to hang him&s;elf with the &s;ame rope that ties up me.
When I was a puppy, I was every day fed in the kitchen, and care&s;&s;ed in the
parlour; and I have now a brother, that always points for the be&s;t of
company. What though our race has been frequently reproached? What though we,
together with the Spaniels, have been accu&s;ed, I do not &s;ay wrongfully, of
crouching to our enemies, and licking the hand that beats us? Is not this every
day practi&s;ed among your &s;pecies, and is it not countenanced by the
greate&s;t examples? In fawning and flattering we are by no means &s;ingular,
and crouching and cringing are not confined to the brute &s;pecies.</P> 
<P> I VERY heartily &s;econd the reque&s;t of my friend, and
doubt not but the arguments you will u&s;e in our behalf will be able to divert
the &s;torm that threatens us. This, you may be a&s;&s;ured of, that if my life
is &s;pared through your means, it &s;hall be devoted to your &s;ervice; 
<PB N="383" REF="390"> and you &s;hall &s;up, as often as you plea&s;e, oh a
brace of birds.</P></Q>
<P>THIS &s;peech was attended with a bark of applau&s;e; and I was
next acco&s;ted by a Lap-Dog, who, after dolefully &s;haking his ears, began
the following harangue.&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">"Though I am aware that many of my &s;pecies
will re|main unhurt by this &s;cheme devi&s;ed for our de&s;truction, yet I
have on my own account great rea&s;on to be alarmed. I was born indeed in a
noble family in <HI>St. James</HI>'s &s;quare, but unfortunately was within
the&s;e three months re&s;igned over to my pre&s;ent mi&s;tre&s;s, an old maid,
who had been through her whole life as frugal of her money as her favours. She
is indeed &s;o very &s;aving, that I have more than once been beat for lapping
up her breakfa&s;t cream, and it was but la&s;t week that I was &s;everely
corrected for devouring a &s;heep's heart, for which &s;he had been to market
her&s;elf. Such a mi&s;tre&s;s will undoubtedly &s;acrifice me to this cruel
tax; and though you may perhaps imagine the lo&s;s of life in the&s;e
circum&s;tances is not much to be regretted, yet death is a terrible remedy,
and a living dog is better than a dead lion. But if &s;ome of our &s;pecies
mu&s;t peri&s;h, &s;urely a regard &s;hould be had to national merit; and the
&s;torm &s;hould fir&s;t fall on tho&s;e foreign intruders, who by the
flatne&s;s of their no&s;es are &s;uppo&s;ed to be of <HI>Dutch</HI>
extraction. If the ladies al&s;o have any regard to the honour of their
country, or any love remaining for Us, it becomes them to take our ca&s;e into
con&s;ideration. And I make no doubt, &s;ince <HI>The</HI> FEMALE PARLIAMENT is
now &s;itting, but if you, Sir, would draw up a petition in our favour; as the
other &s;ex have taken necce&s;&s;ary <PB N="384" REF="391"> precautions for
the pre&s;ervation of the Game, the ladies would in their turn bring in a bill
for the pre&s;ervation of Lap-Dogs."</Q></P>
<P>VARIOUS were the arguments that many others u&s;ed in their own
behalf. The Ma&s;tiff in&s;i&s;ted on the Protec|tion he afforded us, and the
terror he &s;truck into thieves and hou&s;e-breakers. King <HI>Charles</HI>'s
black favourites came fawn|ing upon me, and hoped that their breed might be
pre|&s;erved in deference to the ta&s;te of &s;o witty a monarch. I could not
help &s;miling at the argument made u&s;e of by a Bull-Dog from
<HI>Norfolk:</HI> who declared that he was &s;o in&s;tru|mental to the mirth of
the county, that he firmly believed, they would never part with him; but begged
at the &s;ame time that, if &s;entence <HI>mu&s;t</HI> pa&s;s, it might be
changed into bani&s;hment, and that <HI>Spain</HI> might be the place of his
tran&s;portation.</P>
<P>THE eloquence and ge&s;ture of my four-footed vi&s;iters had
&s;uch an influence over me, that I was ju&s;t going to an&s;wer them in the
manner they could wi&s;h; when my own Dog on a &s;udden jumped into my lap, and
rouzed me from my dream.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_AS no one has a greater re&s;pect for the fair &s;ex than
my&s;elf, I was highly plea&s;ed with a letter in&s;erted &s;ome time ago in
your pa|per, ridiculing the dete&s;table u&s;e of paint among the ladies. This
practice is indeed too general; and for my part, when I meet with a bloom|ing
fre&s;h-coloured face in town, I no more take it for the real face belonging to
the lady, than I imagine Queen <HI>Anne</HI>'s portrait delineated on a
&s;ign-po&s;t to be Her Ma|jedy's fle&s;h and blood.</P>
<P><PB N="386" REF="393">BUT this fa&s;hion is not confined to
the ladies. I am a&s;hamed to tell you that we are indebted to <HI>Spani&s;h
Wool</HI> for many of our ma&s;culine ruddy complexions. A pretty fellow
lackers his pale face with as many varni&s;hes as a fine lady; and it is well
known that late hours at the card-table, amu&s;ements at <HI>Haddock</HI>'s,
immoderate draughts of Champagne, and &s;leeping all night upon a bulk, will
&s;trip the mo&s;t healthy complexion of its ro&s;es. Therefore to repair the
lo&s;s, they are obliged to &s;ub&s;titute the unwhole&s;ome di&s;gui&s;e of
art, for the native hue of a vigorous con&s;titution.</P>
<P>I MUST leave it to you, Mr. TOWN, or your inge|nious
corre&s;pondent to enlarge upon this &s;ubject; and will only ju&s;t appeal to
the ladies, whether a &s;mooth fair face is a proper recommendation of a man to
their favour, and whether they do not look on tho&s;e of the other &s;ex as a
contemptible &s;ort of rivals, who a&s;pire to be thought charming and pretty?
As many females are al&s;o con&s;cious that they them&s;elves endeavour to
conceal by art the defects of nature, they are apt to &s;u&s;pect tho&s;e of
our &s;ex, who are &s;o very &s;ollicitous to &s;et off their per&s;ons: and
indeed I fear it will be found upon examination that our pretty fellows, who
lay on Carmine, are painting a rotten po&s;t.</P>

<P>MANY of my readers will, I dare &s;ay, be hard|ly per&s;uaded
that this cu&s;tom could have ever pre|vailed as a branch of male foppery: but
it is too <PB N="387" REF="394"> notorious that our fine gentlemen, in many
other instances be&s;ides the article of paint, affect the &s;oftne&s;s and
deli|cacy of the fair &s;ex. The male beauty has his wa&s;hes, perfumes, and
co&s;metics; and takes as much pains to &s;et a glo&s;s on his complexion, as
the footman in japan|ning his &s;hoes. He has his dre&s;&s;ing-room and (which
is &s;till more ridiculous) his Toilette too; at which he &s;its as many hours
repairing his battered countenance, as a decayed toa&s;t dre&s;&s;ing for a
birth-night. I had once an opportunity of taking a &s;urvey of one of the&s;e
Male-Toilettes; and as &s;uch a curio&s;ity may perhaps prove entertaining to
many of my readers, I &s;hall here give a de&s;cription of it.</P>
<P>HAVING occa&s;ion one morning to wait on a very pretty fellow, I
was de&s;ired by the <HI>Valet de Cham|bre</HI> to walk into the dre&s;&s;ing
room, till his ma&s;ter was &s;tirring. I was accordingly &s;hewn into a neat
little cham|ber, hung round with <HI>India</HI> paper, and adorned with
&s;everal little images of pagods and bramins, and ve&s;&s;els of <HI>Chel&s;ea
China,</HI> in which were &s;et various-coloured &s;prigs of artificial
flowers. But the Toilette mo&s;t excited my admiration; where I found every
thing was intended to be agreeable to the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> ta&s;te. A
looking-gla&s;s en|clo&s;ed in a whim&s;ical frame of <HI>Chine&s;e</HI>
paling, &s;tood upon a <HI>Japan</HI> table, over which was &s;pread a coverlid
of the fine&s;t chints. I could not but ob&s;erve a number of boxes of
different &s;izes, which were all of them <HI>Japan,</HI> and were regularly
di&s;po&s;ed on the table. I had the curio&s;ity to examine the contents of
&s;everal, and in one I found lip-&s;alve; in another a roll of pigtail; and in
another the ladies black &s;ticking plai&s;ter: but the la&s;t which I opened 
<PB N="388" REF="395"> very much &s;urpri&s;ed me, as I found nothing in it but
a number of little pills. I likewi&s;e remarked in one part of the table a
tooth-bru&s;h and &s;punge with a pot of <HI>Dela&s;cot</HI>'s opiate, and on
the other &s;ide water for the eyes: in the mid|dle &s;tood a bottle of <HI>Eau
de Luce,</HI> and a roll of perfumed pomatum: almond pa&s;tes, powder-puffs,
hair combs, bru&s;hes, nippers, and the like, made up the re&s;t of this
fanta&s;tic equi|page: but among many other wim&s;ies, I could not conceive for
what u&s;e a very &s;mall ivory comb could be de&s;igned, till the valet
informed me, that it was a comb for the eye-brows.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that there are &s;ome men of &s;uch
a delicate make and &s;ilky con&s;titution, that it is no wonder if gentlemen
of &s;uch a lady-like generation have a natu|ral tendency to the refinements
and &s;oftne&s;&s;es of fe|males. The&s;e tender dear creatures are generally
bred up immediately under the wing of their mamas, and &s;carce fed with any
thing le&s;s innocent than her milk. They are never permitted to &s;tudy,
lea&s;t it &s;hould hurt their eyes, and make their heads ache; nor &s;uffered
to u&s;e any exerci&s;es, like other boys, lea&s;t a fine hand &s;hould be
&s;poiled by being u&s;ed too roughly. While other lads are flogged into the
five declen&s;ions, and at length la&s;hed through a whole &s;chool, the&s;e
pretty ma&s;ters are kept at home to improve in whip-&s;illabubs, pa&s;try, and
<HI>face-painting.</HI> In con&s;equence of which, when other young fellows
begin to appear like men, the&s;e dainty creatures come into the world, with
all the accompli&s;hments of a lady's woman.</P>
<P>BUT if the&s;e common foibles of the female world are ridiculous
even in the&s;e equivocal half-men, the&s;e neuter <PB N="389" REF="396">
&s;omethings between male and female, how awkardly mu&s;t they &s;it upon the
more robu&s;t and ma&s;culine part of mankind? What indeed can be more
ab&s;urd, than to &s;ee a huge fellow with the make of a porter, and fit to
mount the &s;tage as a champion at <HI>Broughton</HI>'s Amphitheatre, &s;itting
to varni&s;h his broad face with paint and <HI>Benjamin</HI>-wa&s;h? For my
part I never &s;ee a great looby aiming at <HI>delicate&s;&s;e,</HI> but it
&s;eems as &s;trange and uncouth a figure as <HI>Achilles</HI> in petticoats.
This folly is al&s;o to be particularly condemned, when it appears in the more
&s;olemn characters of life, to which a gravity of ap|pearance is
e&s;&s;ential; and in which the lea&s;t marks of fop|pery &s;eem as improper,
as a phy&s;ician would &s;eem ridiculous pre&s;cribing in a bag-wig, or a
&s;erjeant pleading at the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Bench</HI> in his own hair
in&s;tead of a night-cap periwig. As I think an in&s;tance or two of this kind
would &s;hew this folly in the mo&s;t &s;triking light, I &s;hall here
&s;ubjoin two characters, in whom as it is mo&s;t improper, it will
con&s;equently appear mo&s;t ridiculous.</P>
<P>JOHN HARDMAN is upwards of &s;ix feet high, and &s;tout enough
to beat two of the &s;turdie&s;t chairmen that ever came out of
<HI>Ireland.</HI> Nature indeed &s;eems to have intended <HI>John</HI>
him&s;elf to carry a chair, but fortune has enabled him to appear in whatever
character he likes be&s;t, and he has wi&s;ely di&s;cover|ed, that none will
&s;it &s;o ea&s;y on him as that of a pretty fellow. It is therefore his
&s;tudy to new-mould his face, and per&s;on: He throws his goggle eyes into
leers, langui&s;hes and ogles; and endeavours to draw up his hideous mouth,
that extends from one ear to the other, into a &s;imper. His voice, which is
naturally of a deeper ba&s;e than an hurdy-gurdy, is in a manner &s;et to a new
tune: and his &s;peech, which is very much tinctured with the broad dialect of
a particular county, <PB N="390" REF="397"> is delivered with &s;o much nicety
and gentlene&s;s, that every word is minced and clipt in order to appear &s;oft
and delicate. When he walks, he endeavours to move his unwieldy figure along in
the pert trip, or ea&s;y &s;hambling pace of our pretty fellows; and commonly
carries a thin jemmy &s;tick in his hand, which naturally reminds us of
<HI>Hercules</HI> with a di&s;taff.</P>
<P>THE Reverend Mr. JESSAMY, (who took orders only becau&s;e there
was a good living in the family,) is known among the ladies by the name of the
Beau-Par&s;on. He is in|deed the mo&s;t delicate creature imaginable; and
differs &s;o much from the generality of the clergy, that I believe the very
&s;ight of a plumb-pudding would make him &s;woon. Out of his Canonicals, his
con&s;tant dre&s;s is what they call Par&s;on's-Blue, lined with white; a black
&s;attin wai&s;tcoat, velvet breeches, and &s;ilk &s;tockings: his pumps are of
dog-&s;kin made by <HI>Tull</HI>; and it is &s;aid that he had a joint of one
of his toes cut off, who&s;e length being out of all proportion, prevented his
having a hand&s;ome foot. His very grizzle is &s;carce ortho|dox: for, though
it would be open &s;chi&s;m to wear a bag, yet his wig has always a bag-front,
and is properly cropped behind, that it may not eclip&s;e the lu&s;tre of his
diamond &s;tock-buckle. He cannot bear the thoughts of being &s;ea-&s;ick; or
el&s;e he declares he would certainly go abroad, where he might again re&s;ume
his laced cloaths, and appear like a gentleman in a bag-wig, and &s;word.</P>

<P>_AMONG the many exotic diver&s;ions, that have been
tran&s;planted into this country, there is no one more cultivated, or which
&s;eems to have taken deeper root among us, than that mode&s;t and rational
entertain|ment, the Ma&s;querade. This, as well as the Opera, is originally of
<HI>Italian</HI> growth; and was brought over hither by the celebrated
<HI>Heidegger,</HI> who thence ju&s;tly acquired among his own countrymen the
honourable title of <HI>Sur|intendant des plai&s;irs d' Angleterre.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="392" REF="399">I HAVE called the Ma&s;querade a mode&s;t
and rational entertainment. As to the fir&s;t, no one can have the lea&s;t
&s;cruple about its innocence, if he con&s;iders, that it is al|ways made a
part of the education of our polite females; and that the mo&s;t virtuous woman
is not a&s;hamed to ap|pear there. If it be objected, that a lady is expo&s;ed
to hear many indecencies from the men, (as the ma&s;k gives them a privilege to
&s;ay any thing, though ever &s;o rude) it may be an&s;wered, that no lady is
obliged to take the affront to her&s;elf; becau&s;e, as &s;he goes
di&s;gui&s;ed, the indignity is not offered to her in her own proper per&s;on.
Be&s;ides, ac|cording to Dryden, 
<Q> 
<L>She cannot blu&s;h, becau&s;e they cannot &s;ee.</L></Q></P>
<P>AS to the rationality of this entertainment, every one will
agree with me, that the&s;e midnight orgies are full as rational as &s;itting
up all night at the card-table. Nor is it more &s;trange, that five or &s;ix
hundred people &s;hould meet together in di&s;gui&s;es purpo&s;ely to conceal
them&s;elves, than that the &s;ame number &s;hould a&s;&s;emble at a route,
where mo&s;t of the company are wholly unacquainted with each other.</P>
<P>BUT we can never enough admire the wit and hu|mour of the&s;e
meetings; which greatly con&s;i&s;ts in exhi|biting the mo&s;t fanta&s;tic
appearances, that the mo&s;t whim|&s;ical imagination can po&s;&s;ibly
devi&s;e. A common per&s;on may be content with appearing as a Chine&s;e, a
Turk, or a Fryar; but the true genius will ran&s;ack earth, air, and &s;eas,
reconcile contradictions, and call in things inanimate, as well as animate, to
his a&s;&s;i&s;tance: and the more extra|vagant and out of nature his dre&s;s
can be contrived, the <PB N="393" REF="400"> higher is the joke. I remember one
gentleman above &s;ix foot high, who came to the ma&s;querade dre&s;t, like a
child, in a white frock and leading &s;trings, attended by another gentleman of
exceeding low &s;tature, who offici|ated as his nur&s;e. The &s;ame witty
&s;park took it into his head at another time to per&s;onate Fame, and was
&s;tuck all over with peacock-feathers by way of eyes: but when he came to
fa&s;ten on his wings, they were &s;pread to &s;o enormous a length, that no
coach or chair was &s;pacious enough to admit him; &s;o that he was forced to
be conveyed along the &s;treets on a chair|man's hor&s;e, covered with a
blanket. Another gen|tleman of no le&s;s humour very much &s;urpri&s;ed the
com|pany by carrying a thatched hou&s;e about him; which was &s;o contrived,
that no part of him could be &s;een, except his face, which was looking out of
the ca&s;ement: but this joke had like to have co&s;t him dear, as another wag
was going to &s;et fire to the building, becau&s;e he found, by the leaden
policy affixed to the front, that the tenement was in&s;ured. In a word, dogs,
monkeys, o&s;triches, and all kinds of monitors, are as frequently to be met
with at the ma&s;querade, as in the <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> pantomimes: and I
once &s;aw with great delight a gentleman (who per&s;onated one of
<HI>Bayes</HI>'s recruits) prance a minuet on his hobby-hor&s;e, with a dancing
bear for his partner.</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;aid before, that the Ma&s;querade is of foreign
extraction, and imported to us from abroad. But as the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI>
though &s;low at invention, are remarkable for im|proving on what has already
been invented, it is no wonder that we &s;hould attempt to heighten the gu&s;to
of this enter|tainment, and even carry it beyond the licence of a foreign 
<PB N="394" REF="401"> Carnival. There is &s;omething too in&s;ipid in our fine
gentle|men &s;talking about in dominos; and it is rather cruel to eclip&s;e the
pretty faces of our fine ladies with hideous ma&s;ks: for which rea&s;ons it
has been judged requi&s;ite to contrive a ma&s;querade upon a new plan, and in
an entire new ta&s;te. We may all remember, when (a few years ago) a celebrated
lady endeavoured to introduce a new &s;pecies of Ma&s;querade among us, by
lopping off the exuberance of dre&s;s: and &s;he her&s;elf fir&s;t &s;et the
example, by &s;tripping to the character of <HI>Iphigenia</HI> undre&s;t for
the &s;acrifice. I mu&s;t own, it is a matter of &s;ome &s;urprize to me
(con&s;idering the propen&s;ity of our modern ladies to get rid of their
cloaths,) that other <HI>Iphigenias</HI> did not immediately &s;tart up, or
that nuns and ve&s;tals &s;hould be &s;uffered ever after to be &s;een among
the ma&s;ks. But this project, it &s;eems, was not then &s;ufficiently ripe for
execution, as a certain aukward thing, called Ba&s;hfulne&s;s, had not yet been
bani&s;hed from the female world: and to the pre&s;ent enlightened times was
re&s;erved the honour of introducing (however contradictory the term may
&s;eem) a NAKED MASQUERADE.</P>
<P>WHAT the above-mentioned lady had the hardine&s;s to attempt
alone, will (I am a&s;&s;ured) be &s;et on foot by our per&s;ons of fa&s;hion,
as &s;oon as the hot days come in. <HI>Ra|nelagh.</HI> is the place pitched
upon for their meeting; where it is propo&s;ed to have a Ma&s;querade <HI>Al
Fre&s;co,</HI> and the whole company is to di&s;play all their charms <HI>in
puris natura|libus.</HI> The <HI>Pantheon of the Heathen Gods, Ovid's
Metamor|pho&s;es,</HI> and <HI>Titian's Prints</HI> will &s;upply them with a
&s;ufficient variety of undre&s;t characters. One &s;et of ladies, I am told,
intend to per&s;onate <HI>Water-Nymphs</HI> bathing in the canal: 
<PB N="395" REF="402"> three &s;i&s;ters, celebrated for their charms, de&s;ign
to appear together as the <HI>Three Graces</HI>; and a certain lady of quality,
who mo&s;t re&s;embles the Godde&s;s of Beauty, is now practi&s;ing from a
model of the noted &s;tatue of <HI>Venus de Medicis,</HI> the mo&s;t &s;triking
attitudes for that character. As to the gentlemen, they may mo&s;t of them
repre&s;ent very &s;uitably the half-brutal forms of <HI>Satyrs, Pans,
Fauns,</HI> and <HI>Centaurs:</HI> our beaux may a&s;&s;ume the &s;emblance of
the beardle&s;s <HI>Apollo,</HI> or (which would be more natural) may admire
them&s;elves in the per&s;on of <HI>Narci&s;&s;us:</HI> and our bucks might act
quite in character, by running about &s;tark-naked with their
mi&s;|tre&s;&s;es, and committing the madde&s;t freaks, like the Prie&s;ts and
Prie&s;te&s;&s;es of <HI>Bacchus,</HI> celebrating the <HI>Bacchanalian</HI>
my&s;teries.</P>
<P>IF this &s;cheme for a Naked Ma&s;querade &s;hould meet with
encouragement, (as there is no doubt but it mu&s;t,) it is propo&s;ed to
improve it &s;till further. Per&s;ons of fa&s;hion cannot but lament, that
there are no diver&s;ions allotted to Sunday, except the card-table; and they
can never enough regret, that the Sunday evening tea-drinkings at
<HI>Ranelagh</HI> were laid a&s;ide, from a &s;uper&s;titious regard to
religion. They therefore intend to have a particular &s;ort of Ma&s;que|rade on
that day, in which they may &s;hew their ta&s;te by ridiculing all the old
womens tales contained in that idle book of fables, the Bible; while the vulgar
are devoutly attending to them at church. This, indeed, is not with|out a
parallel: we have had an in&s;tance already of an <HI>Eve</HI>; and by
borrowing the &s;erpent in <HI>Orpheus</HI> and <HI>Eurydice,</HI> we might
have the whole &s;tory of the Fall of Man exhi|bited in a Ma&s;querade.</P>
<P><PB N="396" REF="403">IT mu&s;t, indeed, be acknowledged, that
this project has already taken place among the lowe&s;t of the people, who
&s;eem to have been the fir&s;t contrivers of a Naked Ma&s;querade: and la&s;t
&s;ummer I remember an article in the news-papers, that 
<Q REND="inline">"&s;everal per&s;ons of both &s;exes were
a&s;&s;embled naked at <HI>Pimlico,</HI> and being carried before a
magi&s;trate were &s;ent to Bridewell."</Q> This, indeed, is too refined a
plea&s;ure to be allowed the vulgar: and every body will agree with me, that
the &s;ame act, which at the <HI>Green Lamps,</HI> or <HI>Pimlico</HI> appears
low and criminal, may be polite, and extremely commendable at the
<HI>Haymarket</HI> or at <HI>Ranelagh.</HI></P>

<P>_THE following letter has given me &s;o much plea&s;ure, that I

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. TOWN.</HEAD>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BAYES in the <HI>Rehear&s;al</HI> frequently boa&s;ts it as
his chief excellence that he treads on no man's heels, that he &s;corns to
follow the &s;teps of others; and when he is a&s;ked the rea&s;on of
in&s;erting any ab&s;urdity in his play, he an&s;wers, <HI>becau&s;e it is
new.</HI> The poets of the pre&s;ent time run into the contrary error: they are
&s;o far from endea|vouring to elevate and &s;urprize by any thing original,
that <PB N="398" REF="405"> their whole bu&s;ine&s;s is imitation; and they
jingle their bells in the &s;ame road with tho&s;e that went before them, with
all the dull exactne&s;s of a packhor&s;e.</P>
<P>THE generality of our writers wait till a new walk is pointed
out to them by &s;ome leading genius, when it im|mediately becomes &s;o
hackney'd and beaten, that an author of credit is almo&s;t a&s;hamed to appear
in it among &s;uch bad company. No &s;ooner does one man of parts &s;ucceed in
any particular mode of writing, but he is followed by a thou&s;and dunces. A
good elegy makes the little &s;cribblers direct their whole bent to &s;ubjects
of grief, and, for a whole winter, the pre&s;s groans with melancholy. One
novel of reputation fills all the garrets of <HI>Grub Street</HI> with whole
reams of hi&s;tories and adventures, where volume is &s;pun out after volume,
without the lea&s;t wit, humour, or incident. In a word, as <HI>Bayes</HI>
obviated all objections to his non&s;en&s;e by &s;aying <HI>it was new,</HI> if
a modern writer was a&s;ked why he cho&s;e any particular manner of writing, he
might reply, <HI>becau&s;e it is the fa&s;hion.</HI></P>
<P>TRUE genius will not give into &s;uch idle extravagant flights
of imagination as <HI>Bayes,</HI> it will not turn funerals into banquets, or
introduce armies in di&s;gui&s;e: but &s;till it will not confine it&s;elf to
the narrow track of imitation. I cannot help thinking that it is more owing to
this &s;ervile &s;pirit in the authors of the pre&s;ent time, than to their
want of abili|ties, that we cannot now boa&s;t a &s;et of eminent writers: And
it is worthy ob&s;ervation that whenever any age has been di&s;tingui&s;hed by
a great number of excellent authors, they have mo&s;t of them cultivated
<HI>different</HI> branches of poe|try from each other. This was the ca&s;e in
the age of <HI>Au|gu&s;tus,</HI> <PB N="399" REF="406"> as appears from the
works of <HI>Virgil, Horace, Ovid,</HI> &amp;c. And to come down as late as
po&s;&s;ible, this is evident from our la&s;t famous &s;et of authors, who
flouri&s;hed in the beginning of this century. We admire <HI>Swift, Pope, Gay,
Bolinbroke, Addi&s;on,</HI> &amp;c. but we admire each for his particular
beauties, &s;eparate and di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t.</P>
<P>I FEAR Mr. TOWN, that my letter will appear too vague and
unconnected; but the&s;e loo&s;e thoughts were thrown to|gether merely to
introduce the following little poem, which I think de&s;erves the attention of
the Public. It was writ|ten by a very ingenious gentleman, as a letter to a
friend, who was about to publi&s;h a volume of mi&s;cellanies; and contains all
that original &s;pirit, which it &s;o elegantly re|commends.</P>

<P>_THE various &s;ea&s;ons of the year produce not a greater
alteration in the face of nature, than in the polite manner of pa&s;&s;ing our
time. The diver&s;ions of winter and &s;ummer are as diffe|rent as the dog-days
and tho&s;e at <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI>; nor do I know any genteel amu&s;ement,
ex|cept Gaming, that prevails during the whole year. As the long days are now
coming on, the theatrical gentry, who contribute to di&s;&s;ipate the gloom of
our winter evenings, begin to divide them&s;elves into &s;trolling companies;
and are packing up their tragedy wardrobes, together with a &s;ufficient
quantity of thun|der and lightning, for the delight and amazement of the
coun|try. In the mean time the &s;everal public Gardens near this me|tropolis
are trimming their trees, levelling their walks, and bur|ni&s;hing their lamps,
for our reception. At <HI>Vaux-hall</HI> (which is already opened) the
artificial ruins are repaired; the ca&s;cade is made to &s;pout with &s;everal
additional &s;treams of block-tin; <PB N="404" REF="411"> and they have touched
up all the pictures, which were da|maged la&s;t &s;ea&s;on by the fingering of
tho&s;e curious Con|noi&s;&s;eurs, who could not be &s;atisfied without
<HI>feeling</HI> whether the figures were alive. The magazine at
<HI>Cuper</HI>'s, I am told, is furni&s;hed with an extraordinary &s;upply of
gunpowder, to be &s;hot off in &s;quibs and &s;ky-rockets, or whirled away in
blaz|ing &s;uns and <HI>Catherine</HI> wheels. And it is not to be doubted, in
ca&s;e of a war, but that <HI>Neptune</HI> and all his <HI>Tritons</HI> will
a&s;|&s;i&s;t the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> navy; and as we before took
<HI>Porto-Bello</HI> and <HI>Cape Breton,</HI> we &s;hall gain new victories
over the <HI>French</HI> fleet every night upon that canal.</P>
<P>HAPPY are they, who can mu&s;ter up &s;ufficient, at lea&s;t to
hire tickets at the door, once or twice in a &s;ea&s;on! Not that the&s;e
plea&s;ures are confined to the rich and the great only; for the lower &s;ort
of people have their <HI>Ranelaghs</HI> and their <HI>Vaux|halls</HI> as well
as the quality. <HI>Perrot</HI>'s inimitable Grotto may be &s;een for only
calling for a pot of beer; and the royal di|ver&s;ion of duck-hunting, may be
had into the bargain, toge|ther with a decanter of <HI>Dorche&s;ter,</HI> for
your &s;ix-pence at <HI>Jenny</HI>'s <HI>Whim.</HI> Every &s;kettle-alley half
a mile out of town is embelli&s;hed with green arbours and &s;hady retreats;
where the company is generally entertained with the melodious &s;craping of a
blind fiddler. And who can re&s;i&s;t the lu&s;cious temptation of a fine juicy
ham, or a delicious buttock of beef &s;tuffed with par&s;ley, accompanied with
a foaming decanter of &s;parkling home-brew'd, which is &s;o invitingly painted
at the entrance of almo&s;t every village ale-hou&s;e?</P>
<P>OUR Northern climate will not, indeed, allow us to in|dulge
our&s;elves in all tho&s;e plea&s;ures of a garden, which are &s;o feelingly
de&s;cribed by our poets. We dare not lay our|&s;elves on the damp ground in
&s;hady groves, or by the purl|ing &s;tream, but are obliged to fortify our
in&s;ides again&s;t the cold by good &s;ub&s;tantial eating and drinking. For
this rea&s;on the extreme co&s;tline&s;s of the provi&s;ions at our public
Gardens has been grievou&s;ly complained of by tho&s;e gentry, to whom a
&s;upper at the&s;e places is as nece&s;&s;ary a part of the entertain|ment as
the &s;inging or the fireworks. Poor Mr. <HI>John</HI> &s;ees with an heavy
heart the profits of a whole week's card-money de|voured in tarts and
chee&s;e-cakes by Mrs. Hou&s;e-keeper or Mrs. Lady's own Woman: and the
&s;ub&s;tantial cit, who comes from behind the counter two or three evenings in
the &s;um|mer, can never enough regret the thin wafer-like &s;lices of beef and
ham, that ta&s;te of nothing but the knife.</P>
<P><PB N="405" REF="412">I WAS greatly diverted la&s;t Saturday
evening at <HI>Vaux-hall</HI> with the &s;hrewd remarks made on this very head
by an hone&s;t citizen; who&s;e wife and two daughters had, I found, pre|vailed
on him to carry them to the Garden. As I thought there was &s;omething curious
in their behaviour, I went into the next box to them, where I had an
opportunity of &s;eeing and over-hearing every thing that pa&s;t.</P>
<P>AFTER &s;ome talk,&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">"Come, come, (&s;aid the old don) it is high
time, I think, to go to &s;upper."</Q> To this the ladies readily a&s;&s;ented;
and one of the mi&s;&s;es &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">"do let us have a chick, papa."</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Zounds (&s;aid the father) they are half a
crown a-piece, and no bigger than a &s;parrow."</Q> Here the old lady took him
up&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">"You are &s;o &s;tingy, Mr. <HI>Ro&s;e,</HI>
there is no bearing you. When one is out upon plea&s;ure, I love to appear like
&s;omebody: and what &s;ignifies a few &s;hillings once and away, when a body
is about it?"</Q> This reproof &s;o effectually &s;ilenced the old gentleman,
that the younge&s;t mi&s;s had the courage to put in a word for &s;ome ham
likewi&s;e: Accordingly the waiter was called, and di&s;patched by the old lady
with an order for a chicken and a plate of ham. When it was brought, our
hone&s;t cit twirled the di&s;h about three or four times, and &s;urveyed it
with a very &s;ettled counte|nance; then taking up the &s;lice of ham, and
dangling it to and fro on the end of his fork, a&s;ked the waiter, 
<Q REND="inline">"how much there was of it."</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"A &s;hilling's worth, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid the
fellow. 
<Q REND="inline">"&mdash;Prithee, &s;aid the don, how much do&s;t
think it weighs?&mdash;An ounce?&mdash;A &s;hilling an ounce! that is &s;ixteen
&s;hil|lings <HI>per</HI> pound!&mdash;A rea&s;onable profit truly!&mdash;Let
me &s;ee&mdash;&s;uppo&s;e now the whole ham weighs thirty pounds:&mdash;at a
&s;hilling <HI>per</HI> ounce, that is, &s;ixteen &s;hillings <HI>per</HI>
pound, why your ma&s;ter makes exactly twenty-four pounds of every ham; and if
he buys them at the be&s;t hand, and &s;alts them and cures them him&s;elf,
they don't &s;tand him in ten &s;hil|lings a-piece."</Q> The old lady bade him
hold his non&s;en&s;e, declared her&s;elf a&s;hamed for him, and a&s;ked him if
people mu&s;t not live: then taking a coloured handkerchief from her own neck,
&s;he tucked it into his &s;hirt-collar, whence it hung like a bib, and helped
him to a leg of the chicken. The old gentleman, at every bit he put in his
mouth, amu&s;ed him&s;elf with &s;aying, &mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">"there goes two-pence&mdash;there goes
three-pence&mdash;there goes a groat.&mdash;Zounds a man at the&s;e places
&s;hould not have a &s;wallow &s;o wide as a tom-tit."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="406" REF="413">THIS &s;canty repa&s;t, we may imagine,
was &s;oon di&s;patched; and it was with much difficulty our citizen was
prevailed on to &s;uffer a plate of beef to be ordered. This too was no le&s;s
admired, and underwent the &s;ame comments with the ham: at length, when only a
very &s;mall bit was left, as they &s;ay, for manners in the di&s;h, our don
took a piece of an old news|paper out of his pocket, and gravely wrapping up
the meat in it placed it carefully in his letter ca&s;e. 
<Q REND="inline">"I'll keep thee as a curio&s;ity to my dying
day; and I'll &s;how thee to my neighbour <HI>Hor&s;eman,</HI> and a&s;k him if
he can make as much of his &s;takes."</Q> Then rubbing his hands, and
&s;hrug|ging up his &s;houlders, 
<Q REND="inline">"Why now, &s;ays he, to-morrow night I may eat
as much cold beef as I can &s;tuff in any tavern in <HI>London,</HI> and pay
nothing for it"</Q> A di&s;h of tarts, chee&s;e|cakes and cu&s;tards next made
their appearance at the reque&s;t of the young ladies, who paid no &s;ort of
regard to the fa|ther's remon&s;trance, 
<Q REND="inline">"that they were four times as dear as at the
pa&s;try-cook's."</Q></P>
<P>SUPPER being ended, madam put her &s;pou&s;e in mind to call for
wine.&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">"We <HI>mu&s;t</HI> have &s;ome wine, my dear,
or we &s;hall not be looked upon, you know."</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Well, well, &s;ays the don, that's right
enough. But do they &s;ell their liquor too by the ounce?&mdash;</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Here, drawer, what wine have you got?"</Q> The
fellow, who by this time began to &s;moke his gue&s;ts, an&s;wered&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">"We have exceeding good <HI>French</HI> wine of
all &s;orts, and plea&s;e your honour. Would your honour have a bottle of
Champagne, or Burgundy, or Claret, or"&mdash;</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"No, no, none of your wi&s;hy-wa&s;hy
outlandi&s;h rot-gut for me:"</Q> interrupted the citizen.&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">"A tankard of the Alderman beats all the red
Claret wine in the <HI>French</HI> king's cellar.&mdash;But come, bring us a
bottle of &s;ound old Port; and d'ye hear? let it be good."</Q></P>
<P>WHILE the waiter was gone, the good man mo&s;t &s;adly
la|mented, that he could not have his pipe; which the wife would by no means
allow, 
<Q REND="inline">"becau&s;e (&s;he &s;aid) it was ungenteel to
&s;moke, where there were any ladies in company."</Q> When the wine came, our
citizen gravely took up the bottle, and holding it above his head, 
<Q REND="inline">"Aye, aye, &s;aid he, the bottom has had a good
kick&mdash;And mind how confoundedly it is warped on the &s;ides.&mdash;Not
above five gills, I warrant.&mdash;An old &s;oldier at the <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI>
would beat two of them.&mdash;But let us &s;ee how it is brew'd."</Q> He then
poured out a gla&s;s; and after holding it up before the candle, &s;melling to 
<PB N="407" REF="414"> it, &s;ipping it twice or thrice, and &s;macking with
his lips; drank it off: but declaring that &s;econd thoughts were be&s;t, he
filled another bumper; and to&s;&s;ing that off, after &s;ome pau&s;e, with a
very important air, ventured to pronounce it drinkable. The ladies, having
al&s;o drank a gla&s;s round, af|firmed it was very good, and felt warm in the
&s;tomach: and even the old gentleman relaxed into &s;uch good humour by the
time the bottle was emptied, that out of his own free will and motion he mo&s;t
generou&s;ly called for another pint, but charged the waiter 
<Q REND="inline">"to pick out an hone&s;t one."</Q></P>
<P>WHILE the gla&s;s was thus circulating, the family amu&s;ed
them&s;elves by making ob&s;ervations on the Garden. The ci|tizen expre&s;&s;ed
his wonder at the number of lamps; and &s;aid it mu&s;t co&s;t a great deal of
money every night to light them all: the elde&s;t mi&s;s declared, that for her
part &s;he liked the Dark Walk be&s;t of all, becau&s;e it was
<HI>&s;olentary:</HI> little mi&s;s thought the la&s;t &s;ong mighty pretty,
and &s;aid &s;he would buy it, if &s;he could but remember the tune: and the
old lady ob|&s;erved, that there was a great deal of good company indeed; but
the gentlemen were &s;o rude, that they perfectly put her out of countenance by
&s;taring at her through their &s;py-gla&s;&s;es. In a word, the tarts, the
chee&s;ecakes, the beef, the chicken, the ounce of ham, and every thing,
&s;eemed to have been quite forgot, till the di&s;mal moment approached, that
the reckoning was called for. As this &s;olemn bu&s;ine&s;s concerns only the
gentlemen, the ladies kept a profound &s;ilence; and when the terrible account
was brought, they left the pay|ma&s;ter undi&s;turbed to enjoy the mi&s;ery by
him&s;elf: only the old lady had the hardine&s;s to &s;quint at the &s;um
total, and de|clared 
<Q REND="inline">"it was pretty rea&s;onable
<HI>con&s;idering.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>OUR citizen bore his misfortunes with a tolerable degree of
patience: he &s;hook his head as he run over every article, and &s;wore he
would never buy meat by the ounce again. At length, when he had carefully
&s;ummed up every figure, he bade the drawer bring change for &s;ix-pence: then
pulling out a leathern pur&s;e from a &s;nug pocket in the in&s;ide of his
wai&s;tcoat, he drew out &s;lowly, piece by piece, thirteen &s;hil|lings; which
he regularly placed in two rows upon the ta|ble. When the change was brought,
after counting it very carefully, he laid down four half-pence in the &s;ame
exact or|der; then calling the waiter,&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">"there, &s;ays he, there's your
damage&mdash;thirteen and two-pence&mdash;And hearkye, there's three-pence over
for your&s;elf."</Q> The remaining penny he <PB N="408" REF="415"> put into his
coat-pocket; and chinking it&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">"this, &s;ays he, will &s;erve me to-morrow to
buy a paper of tobacco."</Q></P>
<P>THE family now prepared them&s;elves for going; and as there
were &s;ome &s;light drops of rain, madam buttoned up the old gentleman's coat,
that he might not &s;poil his laced wai&s;t|coat, and made him flap his hat,
over which &s;he tyed his pocket handkerchief, to &s;ave his wig: and as the
coat it&s;elf, (&s;he &s;aid) had never been worn but three Sundays, &s;he even
parted with her own Cardinal, and &s;pread it the wrong &s;ide out over his
&s;houlders. In the&s;e accoutrements he &s;allied forth, accompanied by his
wife with her upper petticoat thrown over her head, and his daughters with the
&s;kirts of their gowns turned up, and their heads muffled up in co|loured
handkerchiefs. I followed them quite out of the Gar|den; and as they were
waiting for their hack to draw up, the younge&s;t mi&s;s a&s;ked, 
<Q REND="inline">"When &s;hall we come again, papa?&mdash;</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Come again? (&s;aid he) what a pox would you
ruin me? Once in one's life is enough; and I think I have done very hand&s;ome.
Why it would not have co&s;t me above four-pence half-penny to have &s;pent my
evening at <HI>Sots Hole:</HI> and what with the cur&s;ed coach hire, and all
together, here's almo&s;t a pound gone, and nothing to &s;how for it."</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Fye, Mr. <HI>Ro&s;e,</HI> I am quite a&s;hamed
for you,"</Q> replies the old lady. 
<Q REND="inline">"You are always grudging me and your girls the
lea&s;t bit of plea&s;ure: and you cannot help grumbling, if we do but go to
<HI>Little Horn&s;ey</HI> to drink tea. I am &s;ure, now they are women grown
up, they ought to &s;ee a little of the world;&mdash;and they SHALL."</Q> The
old don was not willing to pur&s;ue the argument any further; and the coach
coming up, he was glad to put an end to the di&s;pute by &s;ay|ing,&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">"Come, come, let us make ha&s;te, wife; or we
&s;hall not get home time enough to have my be&s;t wig combed out
again;&mdash;and to-morrow, you know, is Sunday."</Q></P>

<P>_IN a vi&s;it which I paid the other day to a lady of great
&s;en&s;e and ta&s;te, I was agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed by having two little
volumes put into my hands, which have been lately pub|li&s;hed under the title
of "POEMS by <HI>EMINENT LADIES.</HI>" The&s;e volumes are, indeed, (as the
author of the preface has remarked) 
<Q REND="inline">"the mo&s;t &s;olid compliment, that can
po&s;&s;ibly be paid to the fair &s;ex."</Q> I never imagined, that our nation
could boa&s;t &s;o many excellent Poete&s;&s;es, (who&s;e works are an honour
to their country) as I found are here collected together: And it is with the
highe&s;t &s;atisfaction I can a&s;&s;ure my female readers in particular, that
I have found a great number of very ele|gant pieces among the writings of
the&s;e ladies, which cannot be &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by the mo&s;t celebrated of our
male-writers.</P>
<P><PB N="410" REF="417">THE plea&s;ure, which I received from
reading the&s;e poems, made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion on my mind, that at night,
as &s;oon as I fell a&s;leep, my fancy pre&s;ented to me the fol|lowing Dream.
I was tran&s;ported, I know not how, to the regions of <HI>Parna&s;&s;us</HI>;
and found my&s;elf in the Court of <HI>Apollo,</HI> &s;urrounded by a great
number of our mo&s;t eminent poets. A cau&s;e of the utmo&s;t importance was
then depend|ing; and the debate was, whether the ladies, who had
di&s;|tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in poetry, &s;hould be allowed to hold the
&s;ame rank, and have the &s;ame honours paid them, with the men. As the
moderns were not allowed to plead in their own &s;uit, <HI>Juvenal</HI> was
retained on the &s;ide of the male poets, and <HI>Sappho</HI> pleaded in
defence of the other &s;ex. The <HI>Roman</HI> &s;atiri&s;t in his &s;peech at
the bar inveighed bitterly again&s;t women in general, and particularly
exclaimed again&s;t their dabbling in literature: but when <HI>Sappho</HI> came
to &s;et forth the preten&s;ions, which the ladies ju&s;tly had to poetry, and
e&s;pecially in love affairs, <HI>Apollo</HI> could no longer re&s;i&s;t the
importunity of the <HI>Mu&s;es</HI> in favour of their own &s;ex. He therefore
decreed, that all tho&s;e females, who thought them&s;elves able to manage
<HI>Pega&s;us,</HI> &s;hould immediately &s;hew their &s;kill and dexterity in
riding him.</P>
<P>PEGASUS was accordingly brought out of the &s;table, and the
<HI>Mu&s;es</HI> furni&s;hed him with a &s;ide-&s;addle. All the ladies, who
had courage enough to venture on his back, were pre|pared to mount: but as a
great di&s;pute aro&s;e among &s;ome of the competitors about precedency, (each
of them claim|ing a right to ride fir&s;t,) it was at length agreed, that they
&s;hould get into the &s;addle according to &s;eniority.</P>
<P>UPON this a lady advanced; who, though &s;he had &s;ome|thing
rather extravagant in her air and deportment, yet &s;he <PB N="411" REF="418">
had a noble pre&s;ence, that commanded at once our awe and admiration. She was
dre&s;&s;ed in an old-fa&s;hioned habit, very fanta&s;tic, and trimmed with
bugles and points; &s;uch as was worn in the times of King <HI>Charles</HI> the
fir&s;t. This lady, I was informed, was the Dutche&s;s of NEWCASTLE. When &s;he
came to mount, &s;he &s;prung into the &s;addle with &s;ur|pri&s;ing agility;
and giving an entire loo&s;e to the reins, <HI>Pe|ga&s;us</HI> directly &s;et
up a gallop, and run away with her quite out of our &s;ight. However, it was
acknowledged, that &s;he kept a firm &s;eat, even when the hor&s;e went at his
deep|e&s;t rate; and that &s;he wanted nothing but to ride with a curb-bridle.
When &s;he came to di&s;mount, <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> and <HI>Milton</HI> very
kindly offered their hand to help her down, which &s;he accepted. Then
<HI>Euterpe</HI> came up to her with a &s;mile, and begged her to repeat
tho&s;e beautiful lines again&s;t Melancholy, which (&s;he &s;aid) were &s;o
extremely pictu|re&s;que. The Dutche&s;s, with a mo&s;t plea&s;ing air,
imme|diately began&mdash;

<P>THE Celebrated ORINDA, Mrs. KATHERINE PHILIPS, was next placed
in the &s;addle, amid the &s;houts and applau&s;es of the lords
<HI>Ro&s;common</HI> and <HI>Orrery, Cowley,</HI> and other fa|mous wits of her
time. Her dre&s;s was &s;imple, though of a very elegant make: it had no
profu&s;e ornaments, and approached very nearly to the cut and fa&s;hion of the
pre&s;ent age. Though &s;he never ventured beyond a canter or an hand-gallop,
&s;he made <HI>Pega&s;us</HI> do his paces with &s;o much ea&s;e and
exactne&s;s, that <HI>Waller</HI> owned he could never bring him under &s;o
much command. After her Mrs. KILLI|GREW, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by <HI>Dryden,</HI> and
&s;everal other ladies of that age took their turns to ride: and every one
agreed, that (making &s;ome allowances for their &s;ex) they could not be

&s;he ap|peared to be half undre&s;t. When &s;he came up to <HI>Pega&s;us,</HI>
&s;he clapped her hand upon the &s;ide-&s;addle, and with a &s;pring leaped
acro&s;s it, &s;aying that &s;he would never ride him but a&s;tride. She made
the poor bea&s;t fri&s;k, and caper, and curvet, and play a thou&s;and tricks;
while &s;he her&s;elf was quite unconcerned, though &s;he &s;hewed her legs at
every motion of the hor&s;e, and many of the <HI>Mu&s;es</HI> turned their
heads a&s;ide blu&s;hing. <HI>Thalia,</HI> indeed, was a good deal plea&s;ed
with her frolicks; and <HI>Erato</HI> declared, that next to her favourite
<HI>Sappho</HI> &s;he &s;hould always prefer this lady. Upon enquiring her name
I found her to be the free-&s;pirited Mrs. BEHN. When &s;he was to di&s;mount,
Lord <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> came up, and caught her in his arms; and repeating

<P>I HAD now the plea&s;ure to &s;ee many ladies of our own times,
who&s;e names I was very well acquainted with, ad|vance towards
<HI>Pega&s;us.</HI> Among the re&s;t I could not but wonder at the
a&s;toni&s;hing dexterity, with which the admired Mrs LEAPOR of
<HI>Brackley</HI> guided the hor&s;e, though &s;he had not the lea&s;t
direction or a&s;&s;i&s;tance from any body. Mrs. BARBER of <HI>Ireland</HI>
was a&s;&s;i&s;ted in getting upon the &s;addle by <HI>Swift</HI> him&s;elf,
who even conde&s;cended to hold the &s;tirrup while &s;he mounted. Under the
Dean's direction &s;he made the hor&s;e to pace and amble very prettily:
notwith&s;tanding <PB N="414" REF="421"> which &s;ome declared, that &s;he was
not equal to her friend and country-woman Mrs. GRIERSON.</P>
<P>ANOTHER lady, a native of the &s;ame kingdom, then bri&s;kly
&s;tepped up to <HI>Pega&s;us</HI>; and de&s;pi&s;ing the weak efforts of her
hu&s;band to prevent her, &s;he boldly jumped into the &s;addle, and whipping
and cutting rode away furiou&s;ly helter &s;kelter over hedge and ditch, and
trampled on every body who came in her road. She took particular delight in
driving the poor hor&s;e, who kicked and winced all the while, into the mo&s;t
filthy places; where &s;he made him fling about the dirt and mire, with which
&s;he be&s;pattered almo&s;t every one that came near her. Sometimes, however,
&s;he would put a &s;top to this mad career; and then &s;he plainly convinced
us, that &s;he knew as well how to manage <HI>Pega&s;us</HI> as any of the
females, who had tried before her. Being told that this lady was no other than
the celebrated biographer of her own actions Mrs. PILKINGTON, I had the
curio&s;ity to take a nearer view of her; when &s;tepping up towards her, and
offering my a&s;&s;i&s;tance to help her down, methought &s;he returned my
civility with &s;uch an uncourteous &s;lap on the face, that (though I awaked
at the in&s;tant) I could not help fancying for &s;ome time, that I felt my
cheek tingle with the blow.</P>

<P>THE contents of the po&s;t&s;cript I naturally referred to the
con&s;ideration of my publi&s;her, who con&s;equently had a right to determine
on the goodne&s;s of my friend's e&s;&s;ay: but, whatever was the rea&s;on, I
heard no more of it. The com|merce between book&s;eller and author is, indeed,
of very great &s;ervice, e&s;pecially to the latter: for though I my&s;elf
mu&s;t undoubtedly be excepted out of the number, yet it mu&s;t be
confe&s;&s;ed, that the mo&s;t famous wits have owed their &s;upport to this
pecuniary intercour&s;e. Meat and drink, and the other conveniences of life,
are as nece&s;&s;ary to an author, as pen, ink and paper: and I remember to
have &s;een in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mr. <HI>Ton&s;on</HI> a curious

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. TOWN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been happy all this winter in having the run of a
nobleman's table, who was plea&s;ed to patronize a work of mine, and to which
he allowed me the honour of pre|fixing his name in a dedication. We
geniu&s;&s;es have a &s;pirit, you know, far beyond our pockets: and (be&s;ides
the extra|ordinary expence of new cloaths to appear decent) I a&s;&s;ure you I
have laid out every farthing, that I ever received from his lord&s;hip, in tips
to his &s;ervants. After every dinner I was forced to run the gauntlet through
a long line of powdered pick-pockets; and I could not but look upon it as a
very ridiculous circum&s;tance, that I &s;hould be obliged to give money to a
fellow, who was dre&s;&s;ed much finer than my|&s;elf. In &s;uch a ca&s;e, I am
apt to con&s;ider the &s;howy wai&s;t|coat of a foppi&s;h footman or butler out
of livery, as laced down with the &s;hillings and half-crowns of the gue&s;ts.
I would therefore beg of you, Mr. TOWN, to recommend the poor author's ca&s;e
to the con&s;ideration of the gentlemen of the cloth; humbly praying, that they
would be plea&s;ed to let us go &s;cot-free as well as the clergy: for though a
good meal is in truth a very comfortable thing to us, it is enough to blunt the
edge of our appetites, to con&s;ider that, we mu&s;t afterwards pay &s;o dear

<P>BY &s;ome of my papers I find I have drawn upon me the
cen&s;ure, not only of the Free-thinkers, but of the Moravians, Methodi&s;ts,
and other numerous &s;ectaries, which have lately &s;tarted up in oppo&s;ition
to our e&s;tabli&s;hed religion. The following letter bears about it &s;o many
marks of an original, that it certainly comes from one of their teachers, who
(as his &s;tile &s;mells &s;o much of the craft) is undoubtedly &s;ome

<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE taken the pains as u&s;ual to read your paper, and as
you receive letters, I thought proper among the re&s;t to &s;end one al&s;o, to
let you know that I did not know that a cat was capable of con&s;tituting a
religious &s;ociety before. A prie&s;t may, tis true; and &s;o may another
rational creature, and perhaps an old woman al&s;o. But, &s;ir, you argue, that
what a <HI>French</HI> fool or lunatic &s;ays on this head, is true; but you
make more out, I ob&s;erve, from the old woman and the leathern apron, than you
do of the cat. For, if old women will, or does con&s;titute a religious
&s;ociety, I under|&s;tand from the foundation you &s;eem to argue, that you
are as much an old woman as they. For to argue or rea&s;on from an old woman's
&s;tory, and for all your learning, and policy, and cunningne&s;s, and judgment
you &s;eem to have, you have but little of your&s;elf: and as you &s;eem to
ridicule religion, and compare it to athei&s;m or lunacy, I would beg the
favour to know, &s;ir, what religion You are of: but by your talk I fear you
are of none at all. This New Doctrine, &s;ir, that you revile, is the real
go&s;pel, which you will find &s;o, if you hear it, and compare it with the
&s;criptures, if you believe any &s;cripture at all. For you &s;ay, &s;ir, that
the mo&s;t extraordinary tenets of religion are very &s;ucce&s;sfully
propa|gated under the &s;anction of leathern aprons in&s;tead of ca&s;&s;ocks.
Well, and &s;uppo&s;e it is: you acknowledge it is received by well
di&s;po&s;ed people; and if it is, then it is plain, us you ridicule it, you
are not one of the&s;e well di&s;po&s;ed. But, &s;ir, this New Doctrine, as you
call it, is not only propagated <PB N="419" REF="426"> under the &s;anction of
leathern aprons, by barbers, brick|layers, and the like, but by many of the
clergy now in the e&s;tabli&s;hed church: and if you often went to hear them,
but not as a critic to carp at what is there &s;poken, you would under&s;tand
more what this New Doctrine meant, and whe|ther it drives men to
enthu&s;ia&s;m, and the like, or no. Sir, what you touch on the Moravians, I
will not &s;ay any thing about or again&s;t; for perhaps it is too true. But,
&s;ir, I would advi&s;e you to know a little more of religion experimentally
for your&s;elf, before you pretend to condemn others. And, &s;ir, if you are
informed, that there will be a mad-hou&s;e built on the ground where the
Foundery &s;tands, or the Me|thodi&s;ts meeting-hou&s;e, as you call it,
perhaps there may be as many critici&s;ing lunatics in it, as religious ones;
and very likely more. Sir, I beg you would take care, you don't bother your
brains too much about other peoples affairs; le&s;t I &s;hould have the pain,
not the plea&s;ure, of &s;eeing you there. I have ju&s;t given you a &s;ketch
of the ridiculing the New Doctrine, and wi&s;h you could find &s;ome better
employ, if &s;o be it was with a leathern apron before you; for I think it
would become you better than this point does. Sir, I hope you will excu&s;e my
freedom with you, as others mu&s;t yours with them.</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SOME time ago you archly remarked that there was not one
<HI>Woman</HI> left, but that the whole &s;ex was elevated into
<HI>Ladies.</HI> You might at the &s;ame time have taken notice 
<PB N="420" REF="427"> of the wonderful increa&s;e among the other &s;ex in the
order of GENTLEMEN. Be&s;ides tho&s;e, who are univer&s;ally acknow|ledged of
this rank from their birth and &s;ituation in life, the courte&s;y of
<HI>England</HI> al&s;o entitles all per&s;ons who carry arms to that dignity:
&s;o that his Maje&s;ty's three regiments of guards are compo&s;ed entirely of
Gentlemen; and every prig|gi&s;h fellow, who can clap a que&uuml;e to his
peruke, and hang a &s;word aukwardly dangling by his &s;ide, from thence
a&s;&s;umes the importance as well as name of a Gentleman. Idlene&s;s and
ignorance being too often the di&s;grace of tho&s;e, who are Gentlemen born and
bred, many inve&s;t them&s;elves with that dignity, though with no other
qualifications. If the pride, poverty, or neglect of parents, has prevented
their &s;on from being bound 'prentice, or if the idle ra&s;cal has &s;hewn his
indentures a light pair of heels, in either ca&s;e <HI>Tom</HI> is of no trade,
and con&s;equently a Gentleman. I know at this time a man, who came from
<HI>Ireland</HI> la&s;t &s;ummer with a hayfork, but before winter rai&s;ed
him&s;elf to the rank of a Gentleman: and every day I go to
<HI>Windmill-&s;treet,</HI> I &s;ee a very honour|able Gentleman betting large
&s;ums of money, whom I for|merly remember Marker of the Tennis Court. Add to
this, that all attorneys clerks, prentices, and the like, are Gen|tlemen every
evening; and the citizen, who drudges all the re&s;t of the week behind the
counter, every &s;unday, together with his laced wai&s;tcoat and ruffles, puts
on the Gentleman. Every author, Mr. TOWN, is a Gentleman, if not an E&s;quire,
by his profe&s;&s;ion; and all the players, from King <HI>Richard</HI> to the
<HI>Lieutenant of the Tower,</HI> are Gentlemen. The body of Gentlemen is
&s;till more numerous; but I have not lei&s;ure at pre&s;ent to climb up to
garrets, or dive into cellars after them: I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that many
of the above-mentioned members of this order die with the &s;ame reputation
that they lived, and go out of the world like 'Squire <HI>Maclean,</HI> or
Gentleman <HI>Harry.</HI></P>
