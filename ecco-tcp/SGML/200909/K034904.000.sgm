<HEAD>EXPLANATION OF THE ANNEXED PLAN.</HEAD>
<P>THE town (di&s;tingui&s;hed by being coloured red) is contained in a &s;quare, each &s;ide of which is 4 furlongs, or half a mile; having a &s;quare furlong, or 10 acres, in the centre, appropriated to public offices (<HI>viz.</HI> a church, town-hall, guard-hou&s;e, &s;eparate penitentiary lots (or pri&s;ons) for males and females; al&s;o &s;chools for each &s;ex, and a public caravan&s;era for &s;trangers and travellers, under the control of the con&s;table on guard by rotation). The Breadth of the &s;treets and highways is propo&s;ed to be the 8th part of a furlong, or 82 feet 6 inches; which will allow room for aquaducts wherever &s;treams of water can be in|troduced from &s;uperior levels, and al&s;o room for planting ranges of &s;preading trees to &s;helter the foot|paths. And as the bounds of each &s;quare furlong meet in the centre of the &s;treets, mea&s;ured from the 4 external edges or &s;ides of the town (coloured red), which are di&s;tant, each from its oppo&s;ite &s;ide, 4 com|plete furlongs, or half a mile (4 inches by the &s;cale), the&s;e external edges or lines of the town and the &s;treets mu&s;t be fir&s;t laid out, that the remaining &s;pace, in each &s;quare furlong of the town, may be divided into <HI>town-lots</HI> in equal proportions, <HI>viz.</HI> 2 oppo&s;ite &s;ides of the town are appropriated to large town-lots of nearly one acre each for PLANTERS or FARMERS;
<PB N="4" REF="4">and as the&s;e <HI>large town-lots</HI> commence from the ex|ternal edge of the town (and not from the centre of the &s;treets, like the <HI>&s;mall town-lots</HI>), their length will be a complete half furlong, or 330 feet: In their breadth there will be &s;ome variation: The uppermo&s;t and undermo&s;t divi&s;ions of &s;quare furlongs, being mea&s;ured from the external edges, or red lines, at the top and bottom of the town (as repre&s;ented in this Plan), have a deduction of 41 feet 3 inches for half the width of the &s;treet on one &s;ide only; which, &s;ubtracted from 660 feet, the breadth of the furlong, leaves a &s;pace of 618 feet 9 inches for the breadth of 5 lots: Which &s;pace divided by 5 allows the breadth of each PLANTER'S TOWN-LOT, in the uppermo&s;t and lowermo&s;t divi&s;ions to be 123 feet 9 inches includ|ing the fences; and the PLANTERS <HI>town-lots,</HI> in the 4 central divi&s;ions (as the central divi&s;ions have a &s;treet on 2 &s;ides), mu&s;t lo&s;e 82 feet 6 inches from the width of each furlong, which being fir&s;t deducted from the 660 feet leave a breadth of only 577 feet 6 inches to be divided into 5 equal parts, whereby the width of the PLANTERS <HI>lots</HI> in the 4 central divi&s;ions, is reduced to 115 feet 6 inches each, including the fences.</P>
<P>The &s;ize of the &s;mall town-lots will al&s;o unavoid|ably vary, and be of two different dimen&s;ions as to their <HI>breadth,</HI> though all are of equal <HI>length:</HI> For as they are mea&s;ured from the centre of each &s;quare furlong to the centre of the &s;treets, a deduction of 41 feet 3 inches (half the width of the &s;treets) mu&s;t be made from the <HI>length</HI> of half a furlong, or 330 feet, which reduces the length of each lot to 288 feet 9 inches. And 41 feet 3 inches being al&s;o deducted
<PB N="5" REF="5">from the <HI>breadth</HI> of the uppermo&s;t and lowe&s;t ranges of &s;quare furlongs, for half the width of the &s;treet, on one &s;ide of each furlong, the &s;pace for the width of 6 lots is thereby reduced to 618 feet 9 inches, which divided by 6 gives 103 feet 1 inch and half, for the width of each lot, including the fences: And 82 feet 6 inches being deducted from the central divi&s;ions, for half the width of the &s;treets on 2 &s;ides of each divi&s;ion, or &s;quare furlong, reduce the &s;pace for 6 lots to 577 feet 6 inches, which divided by 6 gives only 96 feet 3 inches for the width of the <HI>&s;mall town|lots</HI> in the <HI>central</HI> divi&s;ions, including their re&s;pective fences.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> In old &s;ettled countries, where land is al|ready of con&s;iderable value, it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that the proprietors of land can be induced to <HI>give gratis</HI> more than the <HI>&s;mall town-lots</HI> of half an acre and a few poles each, which with the roads and &s;treets will amount to about 120 acres to be given <HI>gratis</HI> out of 2560 acres, or le&s;s than 4 &frac34; per cent.; and the improved value of the remaining e&s;tate, mo&s;t cer|tainly, will amply repay the donation; as the value of land is generally doubled by the proximity of a town.</P>
<P>And as even this la&s;t propo&s;ed donation of 120 acres will be much too large a venture for land|holders in general to ri&s;que in &s;uch an experiment; it is nece&s;&s;ary to remark, that they may proceed on the half of this plan, quite as effectually, by dividing the town and town&s;hip in the centre, whereby the land to be <HI>given gratis,</HI> or granted in <HI>freehold</HI> to the &s;ettlers, will not exceed 60 acres: And even with this
<PB N="6" REF="6">large reduction of the plan, &s;pace will be re&s;erved for the families of 20 farmers or planters and of 68 ar|tificers or labourers; and as the line of divi&s;ion in this latter mode will pa&s;s through the centre &s;quare of the pre&s;ent plan, 6 additional &s;mall town-lots may be formed in the &s;pace of half the &s;quare, and half of the public lots around it, which will enable the town, upon the whole, to contain 94 hou&s;eholds. And if 6 cottages for labourers be added at the outer gates or avenues of the e&s;tate, the community will form a complete <HI>hundred</HI> of hou&s;eholders, which is a very re&s;pectable body of people for maintaining peace and good order according to the common law of England.</P>
<P>Whenever only <HI>one half</HI> of the plan is adopted, the &s;ide where the central line of divi&s;ion is made mu&s;t be placed next to the water (whether the &s;ea or river, creek or canal), and care mu&s;t be taken that a &s;uf|ficient <HI>&s;trand,</HI> or &s;pace of <HI>common land,</HI> be re&s;erved be|tween the town and the water, that all the inhabit|ants may have equal acce&s;s to the water-&s;ide.</P>

<HEAD>EXTRACT OF A <HI>LETTER FROM THE AUTHOR,</HI> TO A GENTLEMAN IN THE EAST INDIES.</HEAD>
<P>FROM &s;ome late determinations in the courts of Bengal again&s;t Slave Dealers, and oppre&s;&s;ors of the poor labouring natives (accounts of which have been publi&s;hed in our Engli&s;h new&s;papers), the Public here, in general, are well &s;atisfied that the poor natives in India are <HI>free,</HI> and receive <HI>wages for their labour:</HI> And, con&s;equently, all the mo&s;t &s;teady friends to the mea&s;ure of <HI>aboli&s;hing the Slave Trade</HI> are &s;olicitous to promote the u&s;e and &s;ale of <HI>Ea&s;t India Sugar,</HI> in preference to that which is cultivated <HI>by Slaves</HI> el&s;ewhere: So that you may be a&s;&s;ured that the <HI>Sugar Trade from India</HI> may be immen&s;ely increa&s;ed, and the value of the new-acquired lands in India may be amply advanced for the benefit of the Hon. Ea&s;t India Company (or of the proprietors of Ea&s;t Indian lands in general), if due care be taken by the Company's agents and &s;ervants to &s;atisfy Europeans that the Ea&s;t India Sugar continues to be really the produce of <HI>free labour:</HI> And care mu&s;t al&s;o be taken to prevent <HI>We&s;t Indian</HI> adventurers, or others, from forming plantations in any of the new-acquired
<PB N="18" REF="17">Indian lands (now become Briti&s;h territory) on any other plan, than that of <HI>free labour;</HI> that the baneful and iniquitous practice of <Q><HI>exacting la|bour without wages</HI></Q> may be effectually prevented, and be duly deemed as dete&s;table among men, as it is, certainly, abominable in the &s;ight of God! All impo&s;ing contracts for labour &s;hould al&s;o be vigilantly guarded again&s;t by the admini&s;trators of government in the &s;everal Indian departments; for, next after the <HI>abolition of the Slave Trade</HI> and <HI>Slavery,</HI> the mo&s;t important con&s;ideration certainly is, how to place the poor labouring natives of India in &s;uch a happy &s;tate of permanent e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, as may in&s;ure to them a general &s;ub&s;i&s;tence independent of the caprice and inju&s;tice of mono|polizers, and the gra&s;ping &s;peculations of merce|nary adventures; and yet, with &s;uch moderation in this little elevation of their condition, that they may &s;till feel &s;ufficient inducement to prompt their <HI>indu&s;try</HI> for the public good. To this point I have lately turned my thoughts, and have rea&s;on to think, that it may ea&s;ily be effected, not only to the advantage and &s;ecurity of the indu&s;trious poor, and to the general promotion of trade in the numerous articles which the labourers, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> little elevation of their condition, will be enabled to purcha&s;e; but al&s;o, at the &s;ame time, to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>very great advantage and profit of the rich.</HI> I mean tho&s;e that have much <HI>landed property,</HI> and have thereby the power of carrying &s;uch a plan into execution. For by granting a very &s;mall propor|tion
<PB N="19" REF="18">of their lands to indu&s;trious labourers, upon the conditions I have propo&s;ed in the inclo&s;ed paper, they will be enabled <HI>to rai&s;e the value of all the re&s;t of their lands:</HI> For by this means they will never be at a lo&s;s, either for <HI>free labourers</HI> to cultivate whatever parts of their e&s;tates they &s;hall chu&s;e to continue in their own hands, or for a &s;ufficient number of well-known people among them, of approved indu&s;try, that may be <HI>tru&s;ted to contract, as renters,</HI> for the cultivation of the remainder of their e&s;tates in &s;mall portions, or farms, &s;uited to their re&s;pective abilities, and at their own ri&s;que. And, by the &s;ame means (I am per&s;uaded), the value of the new-acquired lands in India may be exceedingly enhanced, as well for the advantage of the natives as for the Hon. Ea&s;t India Company, and of all their agents and &s;ervants, in ca&s;e the latter &s;hould be per|mitted to realize their fortunes (acquired in India) by inve&s;tments of <HI>landed property,</HI> purcha&s;ed either of the Company, or of the native proprietors; e&s;pecially as the increa&s;ing demand for <HI>Ea&s;t Indian Sugar</HI> affords great encouragement for cultivating lands in India; and there are many other branches of hu&s;bandry, hitherto neglected in India, as the planting of <HI>&s;ago trees,</HI> and a variety of other va|luable <HI>productive vegetables,</HI> which would enrich the occupiers of land; and amply a&s;&s;ord a due compence to the indu&s;trious labourers.</P>
<P>I am aware, however, that my propo&s;al, in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nclo&s;ed paper, of e&s;tabli&s;hing <HI>Frankpledge</HI> among
<PB N="20" REF="19">the <HI>Indian nations,</HI> will be charged with objections too commonly deemed <HI>in&s;uperable</HI> by Europeans that have dwelt among them, and who, therefore, ought to be be&s;t acquainted with their di&s;po&s;itions. The inveterate prejudices of the Gentoos, con|cerning the (imaginary) in&s;crutable antiquity of the Braminical traditions, and their (&s;uppo&s;ed) <HI>unalienable</HI> attachment to their religion, will be alleged. But how &s;hall we venture to rely on the experience and con&s;equent opinions of mo&s;t of the Europeans that have lived among them, in a point, which they are &s;o far from having attempt|ed to inve&s;tigate with candour, that many of them, through a lamentable neglect or ignorance of chri&s;tianity and ancient hi&s;tory, have rather been inclined blindly to adopt, than to confute, the ab|&s;urdities of Gentooi&s;m?</P>
<P>One Engli&s;h gentleman, though he is neither de|ficient in under&s;tanding nor in experience and knowledge of the manners and di&s;po&s;itions of the Gentoos, has very gravely informed us of a great &s;imilarity between the <HI>Mo&s;aical Laws</HI> and tho&s;e of the <HI>Gentoos.</HI> But this gentleman (who&s;e be+nevolent intentions I do not at all que&s;tion, or even &s;u&s;pect) has not been &s;ufficiently aware o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> "the <HI>my&s;tery of iniquity,</HI> and the <HI>working of Satan," the great <HI>"deceiver of the nations!"</HI> For all <HI>tru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> religion is uniform in <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and in <HI>ju&s;tice&punc;</HI> Whereas the code of laws, which he has commend+ed, abounds with <HI>inju&s;tice, fal&s;ehood,</HI> and <HI>cruel oppr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;|&s;ion of the poor,</HI> though &s;ome faint traces of <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="21" REF="20">morality</HI> may &s;eem to be di&s;per&s;ed among the&s;e laws for the more ea&s;y &s;eduction of indi&s;criminate people, as <Q><HI>Satan will always endeavour to appear as an Angel of Light,</HI></Q> and all his votaries wear a ma&s;k of very oppo&s;ite features from tho&s;e that are hid by it! But &s;ome even of the very laws which are included in this gentleman's publica|tion, and which are, thereby, expo&s;ed to the light of truth and common &s;en&s;e, afford ample confu|tation of his own remark; for by the&s;e it appears, that <HI>the Gentoo laws</HI> proceed by a <HI>&s;even-fold</HI> pro|portion of IN-EQUITY (i. e. a <HI>numerical perfection</HI> of IN-IQUITY), extorting from the poor <HI>Sooders</HI> fines of <HI>&s;even times</HI> the value that are required of the Bramins for <HI>the very &s;ame offences;</HI> though the <HI>Laws of God,</HI> declared by Mo&s;es (to which they have been very injudiciou&s;ly compared), ab&s;olutely prohibit <HI>any re&s;pect of per&s;ons in judgment.</HI> And notwith&s;tanding the pretended <HI>mildne&s;s</HI> of the&s;e laws, yet the cloven foot is apparent; for the Sooder is doomed to be <HI>burned alive</HI> for <HI>fornication</HI> with a Bramin woman, even though &s;he &s;hould have been proved the fir&s;t &s;educer; whereas the Bramin, for the abominable and irreparable injury to a female Sooder, even of a <HI>violent rape,</HI> is let off for a <HI>&s;mall fine!</HI> And this dete&s;table and enormous iniquity is even e&s;tabli&s;hed by an ac|knowledged law! Nay there is an expre&s;s law to in&s;ure to the <HI>Bramins</HI> the gro&s;s privilege (which they claim for the indulgence of their lu&s;t) that <Q><HI>it is lawful for a Bramin to tell a lie to deceive a
<PB N="22" REF="21">woman.</HI></Q> And yet with all the&s;e <HI>abominable</HI> pri|vileges, bad as they are, their iniquity is &s;till aggravated by the <HI>bla&s;phemous</HI> fal&s;ehood, that their deceitful ca&s;t <Q><HI>proceeded from the mouth of the Creator, other ca&s;ts from inferior parts of his body, and the Sooders from the &s;oles of his fect.</HI></Q> Satan could not &s;ugge&s;t a more malicious calumny again&s;t, the <HI>divine ju&s;tice!</HI> It is &s;o evident a token of <HI>"the my&s;tery of iniquity</HI>
and <HI>"working of Satan,"</HI> that we need not &s;earch farther in the <HI>Gentoo Laws</HI> for the declared <HI>"Doctrines of De|mons,"</HI> the two revealed marks of <HI>"the my&s;tery of iniquity"</HI> by which Chri&s;tians are warned to know <HI>"the man of &s;in,"</HI> or <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>the lawle&s;s one,</HI> that was to prevail in the Roman Empire in the <HI>latter times,</HI> viz. <HI>"forbidding to marry,"</HI> and <Q><HI>com|manding to ab&s;tain from meats,</HI> &amp;c.</Q>&mdash;though the poor Gentoos are al&s;o grievou&s;ly injured and de|luded by the <HI>la&s;t</HI> of the&s;e marks. For as the inter|po&s;ition of <HI>"deluding &s;pirits"</HI> is manife&s;ted, in the apo&s;tate church of the Roman Empire, by the open a&s;&s;umption of a <HI>pagan title of prie&s;thood,</HI> PONTIFEX, and, &s;till more e&s;pecially, by that mo&s;t pre&s;umptuous title of pretended <HI>infallibility,</HI> and <HI>univer&s;al dominion,</HI> PONTIFEX MAXIMUS, through which this dangerous u&s;urper of unli|mited power (under the ma&s;que of religion) be|came the <HI>true "image of the bea&s;t,"</HI> the former IMPERIAL PONTIFICES, or <HI>Heathen Emperors,</HI> who did not more haughtily &s;uppre&s;s the natural rights of mankind than did their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors the PAPAL
<PB N="23" REF="22">PONTIFICES, in proclaiming <HI>Cru&s;ades,</HI> and in ex|citing lawle&s;s Princes to wage <HI>bloody</HI> and <HI>de&s;truc|tive</HI> wars again&s;t all per&s;ons that oppo&s;ed their <HI>image</HI> wor&s;hip, and other <HI>antichri&s;tian</HI> corruptions; and in e&s;tabli&s;hing bloody <HI>inqui&s;itions</HI> to maintain this horrible tyranny! So the &s;ame unnatural <HI>in|terpo&s;ition</HI> may as evidently be traced to its <HI>&s;piritual</HI> &s;ource by the baneful fruits and bloody track of <HI>inqui&s;itorial</HI> cruelty and tyranny manife&s;ted in the Laws of the Bramins lately publi&s;hed; as the <HI>cutting off the</HI> <Q><HI>buttock of a Sooder,</HI> for <HI>&s;itting on the carpet of a Bramin!</HI> the <HI>cramming a red-hot iron</HI> into their mouths for repeating any words of the Beads or Sha&s;ter!</Q> and the <HI>pouring hot wax into their ears</HI> for &s;itting to hear them read! If the Beads contained any good, it would be con|&s;ummate <HI>Popery,</HI> thus to prohibit the communi|cation of what is <HI>good from the vulgar,</HI> like the univer&s;al prohibition of the Scriptures in the ver|nacular tongues wherever <HI>the bea&s;t</HI> prevails! But there can be no doubt, if the Sooders were duly protected by government from the fear of &s;uch <HI>frightful penalties,</HI> that they would not be back|ward to acknowledge their <HI>ju&s;t and equal claims</HI> to <HI>all the rights of mankind.</HI> And I need only men|tion <HI>the&s;e &s;evere laws</HI> as ample and &s;ufficient proofs to confute the prejudices of gentlemen infallibly experienced (as they &s;uppo&s;e) by their re&s;idence in India, re&s;pecting the imaginary <HI>unalienable</HI> attach|ment of the Hindoos to their fal&s;e religion; for unle&s;s the Bramins them&s;elves had known that the
