<P>_I AM ruined, undone, blown-up, de&s;troyed, and wor&s;e than annihilated, that's certain! &mdash;But was not the news &s;hocking enough, do&s;t thou think, without thy throwing into the too weighty &s;cale, reproaches, which thou coulde&s;t have had no opportunity to make, but for my own voluntary communications? At a time too, when, as it falls out, I have another very &s;en&s;ible di&s;appointment to &s;truggle with?</P>
<P>I imagine, if there be &s;uch a thing as future pu|ni&s;hment, it mu&s;t be none of the &s;malle&s;t mortifica|tions, that a <HI>new</HI> devil &s;hall be puni&s;hed by a wor&s;e <HI>old one.</HI> And, <HI>Take that!</HI> And, <HI>Take that!</HI> to have the old &s;atyr cry to the &s;creaming &s;ufferer, lay|ing on with a cat-o'-nine-tails, with a &s;tar of burn|ing
<PB N="2" REF="3">
bra&s;s at the end of each: And, <HI>For what! For what!</HI>&mdash;Why, if the truth might be fairly told, for not being &s;o bad a devil as my&s;elf!</P>
<P>Thou art, &s;urely, ca&s;ui&s;t good enough to know (what I have in&s;i&s;ted upon <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> iii. <HI>p.</HI> 351, 352.</NOTE> heretofore), that the &s;in of &s;educing a credulous and ea&s;y girl, is as great as that of bringing to your lure an incredulous and watchful one.</P>
<P>However ungenerous an appearance what I am going to &s;ay may have from <HI>my</HI> pen, let me tell thee, That if &s;uch a lady as Mi&s;s Harlowe cho&s;e to enter into the matrimonial &s;tate <HI>(I am re&s;olved to di&s;ap|point thee in thy meditated triumph over my rage and de&s;pair!),</HI> and, according to the old patriarchal &s;y&s;tem, to go on contributing to get &s;ons and daughters, with no other view, than to bring them up piou&s;ly, and to be good and u&s;eful members of the commonwealth, what a devil had &s;he to do, to let her fancy run a gadding after a Rake? One whom &s;he <HI>knew</HI> to be a Rake?</P>
<P>O but truly, &s;he hoped to have the merit of re|claiming him. She had formed pretty notions, how charmingly it would look to have a penitent of her own making, dangling at her &s;ide, to church, thro' an applauding neighbourhood: And, as their family in|crea&s;ed, marching with her thither, at the head of their boys and girls, proce&s;&s;ionally, as it were, boa&s;ting of the fruits of their <HI>hone&s;t de&s;ires,</HI> as my good Lord Bi&s;hop has it in his Licence. And then, what a comely fight, all kneeling down together in one pew, according to elder&s;hip, as we have &s;een in effigie, a whole family upon &s;ome old monument, where the hone&s;t chevalier, in armour, is pre&s;ented kneeling, with uplift hands, and half a dozen jolter-headed crop-eared boys behind him, ranged <HI>gradatim,</HI> or &s;tep-fa&s;hion, according to age and &s;ize, all in the &s;ame po&s;ture&mdash;Facing his pious dame, with a ruff about her neck, and as many whey-faced girls, all
<PB N="3" REF="4">
kneeling behind <HI>her:</HI> An altar between them, and an opened book upon it: Over their heads &s;emilu|nary rays darting from gilded clouds, &s;urrounding an atchievement-motto, IN COELO SALUS&mdash; or QUIES&mdash;perhaps, if they have happened to live the u&s;ual married life of brawl and contradiction.</P>
<P>It is certainly as much my misfortune to have fallen in with Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe, were I to have valued my reputation or ea&s;e, as it is that of Mi&s;s Harlowe to have been acquainted with me. And, after all, what have I done more than pro&s;ecute the ma|xims, by which thou and I, and every Rake are go|verned, and which, before I knew this lady, we have pur&s;ued from pretty girl to pretty girl, as fa&s;t as we had &s;et one down, taking another up;&mdash;ju&s;t as the fellows do, with their flying-coaches and flying-hor&s;es at a country-fair&mdash;With a <HI>Who rides next! Who rides next!</HI></P>
<P>But here, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, to carry on the volant metaphor (for I mu&s;t either be merry, or mad), is a pretty little Mi&s;s, ju&s;t come out of her hanging-&s;leeve coat, brought to buy a pretty little fairing; for the world, Jack, is but a great fair, thou knowe&s;t; and, to give thee &s;erious reflection for &s;erious, all its toys but tin&s;elled hobby-hor&s;es, gilt gingerbread, &s;queaking trumpets, painted drums, and &s;o forth.&mdash;</P>
<P>Now, behold, this pretty little Mi&s;s &s;kimming from booth to booth, in a very pretty manner. One pretty little fellow called Wyerly, perhaps; another jiggeting ra&s;cal called Biron, a third &s;impering var|let of the name of Symmes, and a more hideous villain than any of the re&s;t with a long bag under his arm, and parchment &s;ettlements tagg'd to his heels, y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">leped Solmes; pur&s;ue her from raree-&s;how to raree-&s;how, &s;houldering upon one another at every turning, &s;topping when &s;he &s;tops, and &s;et a &s;pinning again when &s;he moves.&mdash;And thus dangled after, but
<PB N="4" REF="5">
&s;till in the eye of her watchful guardians, traver&s;es the pretty little Mi&s;s thro' the whole fair, equally delighted and delighting: Till at la&s;t, taken with the invitation of the <HI>lac'd-hat orator,</HI> and &s;eeing &s;everal pretty little bib-wearers &s;tuck together in the flying-coaches, cutting &s;afely the yielding air, in the One-go-up, the Other-go-down picture of-the-world ve|hicle, and all with as little fear as wit, is tempted to ride next.</P>
<P>In then &s;uppo&s;e &s;he &s;lily pops, when <HI>none of her friends are near her:</HI> And if, after two or three ups and downs, her pretty head turns giddy, and &s;he throws her&s;elf out of the coach, when at its eleva|tion, and &s;o da&s;hes out her pretty little brains, who can help it!&mdash;And would you hang the poor fellow, who&s;e <HI>profe&s;&s;ed trade</HI> it was to &s;et the pretty little creatures a flying?</P>
<P>'Tis true, this pretty little Mi&s;s, being a <HI>very</HI> pretty little Mi&s;s, being a <HI>very much-admired</HI> little Mi&s;s, being a very <HI>good</HI> little Mi&s;s, who always minded her book, and had pa&s;&s;ed thro' her &s;amplar-doctrine with high applau&s;e; had even &s;titched out in gaudy propriety of colours, an Abraham offering up I&s;aac, a Sam&s;on and the Phili&s;tines, and flowers, and knots, and trees, and the &s;un and the moon, and the &s;even &s;tars, all hung up in frames with gla&s;&s;es before them, for the admiration of her future grand|children: Who likewi&s;e was intitled to a very pretty little e&s;tate: Who was de&s;cended from a pretty little family upwards of one hundred years gentility; which lived in a very pretty little manner, re&s;pected a very little on their own accounts, a great deal on hers:&mdash;</P>
<P>For &s;uch a pretty little Mi&s;s as this to come to &s;o very great a misfortune, mu&s;t be a very &s;ad thing: But, tell me, would not the lo&s;ing of any ordinary child, of any other le&s;s con&s;iderable family, of le&s;s &s;hining or amiable qualities, have been as great and as
<PB N="5" REF="6">
heavy a lo&s;s to that family, as the lo&s;ing this pretty little Mi&s;s to hers?</P>
<P>To de&s;cend to a very low in&s;tance, and that only as to <HI>per&s;onality;</HI> ha&s;t thou any doubt, that thy &s;trong-mu&s;cled bony face was as much admired by thy mother, as if it had been the face of a Lovelace, or any other hand&s;ome fellow; and had thy picture been drawn, would &s;he have forgiven the painter, had he not expre&s;&s;ed &s;o exactly thy lineaments, as that every one &s;hould have di&s;cerned the likene&s;s? The <HI>hand&s;ome</HI> likene&s;s is all that is wi&s;hed for. Ugli|ne&s;s made familiar to us, with the partiality natural to fond parents, will be beauty all the world over.&mdash; Do thou apply.</P>
<P>BUT, alas, Jack, all this is but a copy of my countenance, drawn to evade thy malice!&mdash;Tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t an&s;wer thy unfriendly purpo&s;e to own it, I cannot forbear to own it, that I am &s;tung to the very &s;oul with this unhappy&mdash; <HI>Accident,</HI> mu&s;t I call it?&mdash;Have I nobody, who&s;e throat, either for carele&s;&s;ne&s;s or treachery, I ought to cut, in order to pacify my vengeance!&mdash;</P>
<P>When I reflect upon my <HI>la&s;t</HI> iniquitous intention, the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> outrage &s;o nobly re&s;ented, as well as, &s;o far as &s;he was able, &s;o nobly <HI>re&s;i&s;ted,</HI> I cannot but con|clude, that I was under the power of fa&s;cination from the&s;e accur&s;ed Circes; who, pretending to know their own &s;ex, would have it, that there is in every woman a yielding, or a weak-re&s;i&s;ting moment to be met with: And that <HI>yet,</HI> and <HI>yet,</HI> and <HI>yet,</HI> I had not tried enough:&mdash;But that, if neither love nor terror &s;hould enable me to hit that lucky moment, when, by help of their cur&s;ed arts, &s;he was <HI>once overcome,</HI> &s;he would be for <HI>ever overcome:</HI>&mdash;Appealing to all my experience, to all my knowlege of the &s;ex, for a ju&s;tification of their a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>My appealed to experience, I own, was but too
<PB N="6" REF="7">
favourable to their argument: For do&s;t thou think, I could have held my purpo&s;e again&s;t &s;uch an angel as this, had I ever before met with one &s;o much in earne&s;t to defend her honour again&s;t the unwearied artifices and per&s;everance of the man &s;he loved? Why then were there not more examples of a virtue &s;o immoveable? Or, why was this &s;ingular one to fall to my lot? Except indeed to <HI>double my guilt;</HI> and at the &s;ame time to convince all that &s;hould hear of her &s;tory, <HI>that there are angels as well as devils in the fle&s;h?</HI></P>
<P>So much for confe&s;&s;ion; and for the &s;ake of hu|mouring my con&s;cience; with a view likewi&s;e to di&s;arm thy malice by acknowlegement: Since no one &s;hall &s;ay wor&s;e of me, than I will of my&s;elf on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>One thing I will neverthele&s;s add, to &s;hew the &s;incerity of my contrition:&mdash;'Tis this, that if thou can&s;t by any means find her out within the&s;e three days, or any time before &s;he has di&s;covered the &s;tories relating to Captain Tomlin&s;on and her Uncle to be what they are; and if thou can&s;t prevail upon her to con&s;ent; I will actually, in thy pre&s;ence, and his (he to repre&s;ent her uncle), marry her.</P>
<P>I am &s;till in hopes it may be &s;o&mdash;She cannot be long concealed&mdash;I have already &s;et all engines at work to find her out; and if I do, what <HI>indifferent</HI> per&s;ons (and no one of her <HI>friends,</HI> as thou ob&s;erve&s;t, will look upon her) will care to imbroil them&s;elves with a man of my figure, fortune, and re&s;olution?&mdash;Shew her this part then, or any other part of this letter, at thy own di&s;cretion, if thou <HI>can&s;t</HI> find her: For, after all, methinks I would be glad, that this affair, which is bad enough in it&s;elf, &s;hould go off without wor&s;e per&s;onal con&s;equences to any-body el&s;e; and yet it runs in my mind, I know not why, that &s;ooner or later, it will draw a few drops of blood after it; except &s;he and I can make it up between
<PB N="7" REF="8">
our&s;elves. And this may be another rea&s;on why &s;he &s;hould not carry her re&s;entment too far &mdash; Not that &s;uch an affair would give me much concern neither, were I to choo&s;e my man or men; for I heartily hate all her family but her&s;elf; and ever &s;hall.</P>
<P>LET me add, that the lady's plot to e&s;cape ap|pears to me no extraordinary one. There was much more luck than probability, that it &s;hould do: Since, to make it &s;ucceed, it was nece&s;&s;ary, that Dorcas and Will. and Sinclair and her nymphs, &s;hould be all deceived, or off their guard. It belongs to me, when I &s;ee them, to give them my hearty thanks that they were; and that their &s;elfi&s;h care to provide for their own future &s;ecurity, &s;hould induce them to leave their outward door upon their bolt-latch, and be curs'd to them!&mdash;</P>
<P>Mabell de&s;erves a pitch-&s;uit and a bonfire, rather than the lu&s;tring; and as her cloaths are returned, let the lady's be put to her others, to be &s;ent to her, when it can be told whither.&mdash;But not till I give the word, neither; for we mu&s;t get the dear fugitive back again, if po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e that my &s;tupid villain, who knew not &s;uch a godde&s;s-&s;haped lady with a mien &s;o noble, from the aukward and bent-&s;houldered Mabell, has been at Ham&s;tead to &s;ee after her: And yet I hardly think &s;he would go thither. He ought to go thro' every &s;treet where bills for lodgings are up, to in|quire after a new-comer. The hou&s;es of &s;uch as deal in womens matters, and tea, coffee, and &s;uch-like, are tho&s;e to be inquired at for her. If &s;ome tidings be not quickly heard of her, I would not have either Dorcas, Will. or Mabell, appear in my &s;ight, whatever their &s;uperiors think fit to do.</P>
<P>This, tho' written in character, is a very long letter, con&s;idering it is not a narrative one, or a journal of proceedings, like &s;ome of my former;
<PB N="8" REF="9">
for &s;uch will unavoidably and naturally, as I may &s;ay, run into length. But I have &s;o u&s;ed my&s;elf to write a great deal of late, that I know not how to help it. Yet I mu&s;t add to its length, in order to explain my&s;elf on a hint I gave at the beginning of it, which was, that I have another di&s;appointment, be&s;ides this of Mi&s;s Harlowe's e&s;cape, to bemoan.</P>
<P>And what do&s;t think it is? Why, the old peer <HI>pox</HI> of his tough con&s;titution! (for that would have helped him on) has made &s;hift by fire and brim|&s;tone, and the devil knows what, to force the gout to quit the counter&s;carp of his &s;tomach, ju&s;t as it had collected all its &s;trength, in order to &s;torm the citadel of his heart: In &s;hort they have, by the mere force of &s;tink-pots, hand-granades, and pop-guns, drove the &s;low-working pioneer quite out of the trunk into the extremities; and there it lies nibbling, and gnawing, upon his great toe; when I had hoped a fair end both of the di&s;temper, and the di&s;tem|pered.</P>
<P>But I, who could write to <HI>thee</HI> of laudanum, and the wet cloth formerly, yet let 8000 <HI>l.</HI> a year &s;lip thro' my fingers, when I had entered upon it, more than in imagination (for I had begun to a&s;k the &s;tewards que&s;tions, and to hear them talk of fines and renewals, and &s;uch &s;ort of &s;tuff), <HI>de&s;erve</HI> to be mortified.</P>
<P>Thou can&s;t not imagine, how differently the &s;er|vants, and even my cou&s;ins, look upon me &s;ince ye&s;terday, to what they did before. Neither the one nor the other bow and courte&s;y half &s;o low.&mdash;Nor am I a quarter &s;o often <HI>his honour,</HI> and <HI>your honour,</HI> as I was within the&s;e few hours, with the former: And as to the latter &mdash; It is <HI>cou&s;in Bobby</HI> again, with the u&s;ual familiarity, in&s;tead of <HI>Sir,</HI> and <HI>Sir,</HI> and, <HI>If you plea&s;e, Mr. Lovelace.</HI> And now they have the in&s;olence to congratulate me on the recovery of the <HI>be&s;t of uncles,</HI> while I am forced to &s;eem as much
<PB N="9" REF="10">
delighted as they, when, would it do me good, I could &s;it down and cry my eyes out.</P>
<P>I had be&s;poken my mourning in imagination, after the example of a certain foreign mini&s;ter, who, be|fore the death, or even la&s;t illne&s;s of Charles II. as hone&s;t White Kennet tells us, had half exhau&s;ted Blackwell-hall of its fables: An indication, as the hi&s;torian would in&s;inuate, that the monarch was to be poi&s;oned, and the amba&s;&s;ador in the &s;ecret&mdash;And yet, fool that I was, I could not take the hint!&mdash; What a devil does a man read hi&s;tory for, if he cannot profit by the examples he finds in it?</P>
<P>But thus, Jack, is an ob&s;ervation of the old peer's verified, <HI>That one misfortune &s;eldom comes alone:</HI> And &s;o concludes</P>

<P>YOU will wonder to receive a letter from me. I am &s;orry for the great di&s;tre&s;s you &s;eem to be in. Such a hopeful young lady as you were!&mdash;But &s;ee what comes of di&s;obedience to parents!</P>
<P>For my part; altho' I pity you; yet I much more pity your poor father and mother. Such education as they gave you! &s;uch improvements as you made! and &s;uch delight as they took in you!&mdash;And all come to this!&mdash;</P>
<P>But pray, Mi&s;s, don't make my Nancy guilty of your fault; which is that of di&s;obedience. I have charged her over and over not to corre&s;pond with one, who has made &s;uch a giddy &s;tep. It is not to her reputation, I am &s;ure. You <HI>knew</HI> that I &s;o charged her; yet you go on corre&s;ponding together, to my very great vexation; for &s;he has been very perver&s;e upon it, more than once. <HI>Evil communication,</HI> Mi&s;s&mdash; You know the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Here, people cannot be unhappy by them&s;elves, but they mu&s;t involve their friends and acquaintance, who&s;e di&s;cretion has kept them clear of their errors, into near as much unhappine&s;s, as if they had run into the like of their own heads.

<P>PERMIT me, Madam, to trouble you with a few lines, were it only to thank you for your reproofs; which have neverthele&s;s drawn fre&s;h &s;treams of blood from a bleeding heart.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="14">My &s;tory is a di&s;mal &s;tory. It has circum&s;tances in it, that would engage pity, and po&s;&s;ibly a judg|ment not altogether unfavourable, where tho&s;e cir|cum&s;tances known. But it is my bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;hall be <HI>all</HI> my bu&s;ine&s;s, to repent of my failings, and not endeavour to extenuate them.</P>
<P>But I will not &s;eek to di&s;tre&s;s your worthy mind. If <HI>I cannot &s;uffer alone,</HI> I will make as few parties as I can in my &s;ufferings. And, indeed, I took up my pen with this re&s;olution, when I wrote the letter which has fallen into your hands: It was only to know, and that for a very particular rea&s;on, as well as for affection unbounded, if my dear Mi&s;s Howe, from whom I had not heard of a long time, were ill; as I had been told &s;he was; and if &s;o, how &s;he now does. But my injuries being recent, and my di&s;tre&s;&s;es having been exceeding great, <HI>Self</HI> would croud into my letter. When di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, the human mind is apt to turn it&s;elf to every one in whom it imagined or wi&s;hed an intere&s;t, for pity and con&s;o|lation&mdash;Or, to expre&s;s my&s;elf better and more con|ci&s;ely, in your own words, <HI>Misfortune makes people plaintive:</HI> And to whom, if not to a friend, can the afflicted complain?</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Howe being abroad, when my letter came, I flatter my&s;elf that &s;he is recovered. But it would be &s;ome &s;atisfaction to me to be informed, if &s;he <HI>has been ill.</HI> Another line from <HI>your</HI> hand would be too great a favour. But, if you will be plea&s;ed to direct any &s;ervant to an&s;wer <HI>yes,</HI> or <HI>no,</HI> to that que&s;tion, I will not be farther trouble&s;ome.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, I mu&s;t declare, that my Mi&s;s Howe's friend&s;hip was all the comfort I had, or expected to have, in this world; and a line from her would have been a cordial to my fainting heart. Judge then, deare&s;t Madam, how reluctantly I mu&s;t obey your prohibition&mdash;But yet, I will endeavour to obey it; altho' I &s;hould have hoped, as well from the tenor
<PB N="14" REF="15">
of all that has pa&s;&s;ed between Mi&s;s Howe and me, as from <HI>her</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed virtue, that &s;he could not be tainted by <HI>Evil communication,</HI> had one or two letters been permitted. This, however, I a&s;k not for, &s;ince I think I have nothing to do, but to beg of God (who, I hope, has not yet withdrawn his grace from me, altho' he is plea&s;ed to let loo&s;e his ju&s;tice upon my faults) to give me a truly broken &s;pirit, if it be not already broken enough, and then to take to his mercy</P>

<SALUTE><HI>My dear Mrs.</HI> NORTON,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Addre&s;s my&s;elf to you after a very long &s;ilence (which, however, was not owing either to want of love or duty) principally to de&s;ire you to &s;atisfy me in two or three points, which it behoves me to know.</P>
<P>My father, and all the family, I am informed, are to be at my uncle Harlowe's this day, as u&s;ual. Pray acquaint me, if they have been there? And if they were chearful on the anniver&s;ary occa&s;ion? And al&s;o, if you have heard of any journey, or intended journey, of my brother, in company with Captain Singleton and Mr. Solmes.</P>
<P>Strange things have happened to me, my dear worthy and maternal friend!&mdash;Very &s;trange things! &mdash;Mr. Lovelace has proved a very barbarous and in|grateful man to me. But, God be prai&s;ed, I have e&s;caped from him!&mdash; Being among ab&s;olute &s;trangers (tho' I think worthy folks), I have written to Hannah Burton to come and be with me. If the good crea|ture fall in your way, pray encourage her to come to me. I always intended to have her, &s;he knows: &mdash;But hoped to be in happier circum&s;tances.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="18">Say nothing to any of my friends, that you have heard from me.</P>
<P>Pray, do you think my father would be prevailed upon, if I were to &s;upplicate him by letter, to take off the heavy cur&s;e he laid upon me, at my going from Harlowe-Place?&mdash;I can expect no other favour from him: But that being literally fulfilled, as to my pro&s;pects in this life, I hope it will be thought to have operated far enough.</P>
<P>I am afraid <HI>my Poor,</HI> as I u&s;ed to call the good creatures to who&s;e nece&s;&s;ities I was wont to admi|ni&s;ter, by your faithful hands, have mi&s;&s;ed me of late. But now, alas!

It is a &s;ad thing, my deare&s;t Mrs. Norton, to render our|&s;elves unworthy of the talents Providence has in|tru&s;ted to us!</P>
<P>But the&s;e reflections are now too late; and perhaps I ought to have kept them to my&s;elf. Let me, however, hope, that you love me &s;till. Pray let me hope that you do: And then, notwith&s;tanding my misfortunes, which have made me &s;eem ingrateful to the kind and truly maternal pains you have taken with me from my cradle, I &s;hall have the happine&s;s to think that there is <HI>One</HI> worthy per&s;on, who hates not</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Saturday, July</HI> 1.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR letter, my deare&s;t young lady, cuts me to the heart! Why will you not let me know all your di&s;tre&s;&s;es!&mdash;Yet you have &s;aid enough!</P>
<P>My &s;on is very good to me. A few hours ago he was taken with a feveri&s;h di&s;order. But I hope it will go off happily, if his ardour for bu&s;ine&s;s will give him the rece&s;s from it, which his good ma&s;ter is willing to allow him. He pre&s;ents his duty to you, and &s;hed tears at hearing you &s;ad letter read.</P>
<P>You have been mi&s;informed as to your family's being at your uncle Harlowe's. They did not in|tend to be there. Nor was the day kept at all. Indeed, they have not &s;tirred out, but to church (and that but there times), ever &s;ince the day you went away. &mdash; Unhappy day for them, and for-all who know you!&mdash;To me, I am &s;ure, mo&s;t parti|cularly &s;o!&mdash;My heart now bleeds more and more for you.</P>
<P>I have not heard a &s;yllable of &s;uch a journey as you mention, of your brother, Captain Singleton, and Mr. Solmes. There has been &s;ome talk, indeed, of your brother's &s;etting out for his northern e&s;tates: But I have not heard of it lately.</P>
<P>I am afraid no letter will be received from you. It grieves me to tell you &s;o, my deare&s;t young lady. No evil can have happened to you, which they do not <HI>expect</HI> to hear of; &s;o great is their antipathy to the wicked man, and &s;o bad is his character.</P>
<P>I cannot but think hardly of their unforgivingne&s;s: But there is no judging for others by one's &s;elf. Ne|verthele&s;s I will add, that, if you had had as gentle &s;pirits to deal with as your own, or, I will be bold to &s;ay, as mine, the&s;e evils had never happened either
<PB N="19" REF="20">
to them, or to you. I knew your virtue, and your love of virtue, from your very cradle; and I doubted not but <HI>that,</HI> with God's grace, would always be your guard: &mdash; But you could never be driven; nor was there occa&s;ion to drive you&mdash;So generous, &s;o noble, &s;o di&s;creet&mdash;But how does my love of your amiable qualities increa&s;e my affliction; as the&s;e re|collections mu&s;t do yours!</P>
<P>You are e&s;caped, my deare&s;t Mi&s;s&mdash;Happily, I hope&mdash;That is to &s;ay, with your honour&mdash; El&s;e, how great mu&s;t be your di&s;tre&s;s!&mdash;Yet from your letter I dread the wor&s;t.</P>
<P>I am very &s;eldom at Harlowe Place. The hou&s;e is not the hou&s;e it u&s;ed to be, &s;ince you went from it. Then they are <HI>&s;o</HI> relentle&s;s! And, as I cannot &s;ay har&s;h things of the beloved child of my <HI>heart,</HI> as well as <HI>bo&s;om,</HI> they do not take it <HI>ami&s;s,</HI> that I &s;tay away.</P>
<P>Your Hannah left her place ill &s;ome time ago; and, as &s;he is &s;till at her mother's at St. Alban's, I am afraid &s;he continues ill. If &s;o, as you are among &s;trangers, and I cannot encourage you at pre&s;ent to come into <HI>the&s;e</HI> parts, I &s;hall think it my duty to attend you (let it be taken as it will) as &s;oon as my Tommy's indi&s;po&s;ition will permit; which I hope will be &s;oon.</P>
<P>I have a little money by me. You &s;ay you <HI>are poor your&s;elf</HI>&mdash;How grievous are tho&s;e words from one intitled and accu&s;tomed to affluence! &mdash; Will you be &s;o good to command it, my beloved young lady?&mdash;It is mo&s;t of it your own bounty to me. And I &s;hould take a pride to re&s;tore it to its original owner.</P>
<P>Your Poor ble&s;s you, and pray for you continually. I have &s;o managed your la&s;t benevolence, and they have been &s;o healthy, and have had &s;uch con&s;tant employ, that it has held out; and will &s;till hold out,
<PB N="20" REF="21">
till happier times, I hope, betide their excellent bene|factre&s;s.</P>
<P>Let me beg of you, my deare&s;t young lady, to take to your&s;elf all tho&s;e aids, which good per&s;ons, like you, draw from RELIGION, in &s;upport of their calamities. Let your &s;ufferings be what they will, I am &s;ure you have been innocent in your intention. So do not de&s;pond. None are made to &s;uffer above what they <HI>can,</HI> and therefore <HI>ought</HI> to bear.</P>
<P>We know not the methods of Providence, and what wi&s;e ends it may have to &s;erve in its di&s;pen&s;a|tions to its poor creatures.</P>
<P>Few per&s;ons have greater rea&s;on to &s;ay this than my&s;elf. And &s;ince we are apt in calamities to draw more comfort from example than precept, you will permit me to remind you of my own lot: For who has had a greater &s;hare of afflictions than my&s;elf?</P>
<P>To &s;ay nothing of the lo&s;s of an excellent mother, at a time of life when motherly care is mo&s;t wanted; the death of a dear father, who was an ornament to his cloth (and who had qualified me to be his &s;cribe and amanuen&s;is), ju&s;t as he came within view of a preferment which would have made his family ea&s;y, threw me friendle&s;s into the wide world; threw me upon a very carele&s;s, and, which was much wor&s;e, a very unkind hu&s;band. Poor man!&mdash;But he was &s;pared long enough, thank God, in a tedious illne&s;s, to re|pent of his neglected opportunities, and his light principles; which I have always thought of with plea&s;ure, altho' I was left the more de&s;titute for his chargeable illne&s;s, and ready to be brought to bed, when he died, of my Tommy.</P>
<P>But this very circum&s;tance, which I thought the un|happie&s;t that I could have been le&s;t in (&s;o &s;hort-&s;ighted is human prudence), became the happy means of re|commending me to your mother, who, in regard to my character, and in compa&s;&s;ion to my very de&s;titute circum&s;tances, permitted me, as I made a con&s;cience
<PB N="21" REF="22">
of not parting with my poor boy, to nur&s;e both you and him, born within a few days of each other. And I have never &s;ince wanted any of the humble ble&s;&s;ings which God has made me contented with.</P>
<P>Nor have I known what a very great grief was, from the day of my poor hu&s;band's death, till the day that your parents told me how much they were de|termined that you &s;hould have Mr. Solmes; when I was appri&s;ed not only of your aver&s;ion to him, but how unworthy he was of you: For then I began to dread the con&s;equences of forcing &s;o generous a &s;pirit; and, till then, I never feared Mr. Lovelace, attracting as was his per&s;on, and &s;pecious his manners and addre&s;s. For I was &s;ure you would never have him, if he gave you not good rea&s;on to be convinced of his reforma|tion; nor till your friends were as well &s;atisfied in it as your&s;elf. But that unhappy mi&s;under&s;tanding be|tween your brother and Mr. Lovelace, and their joining &s;o violently to force you upon Mr. Solmes, did all that mi&s;chief, which has co&s;t you and them &s;o dear, and poor me all my peace! O what has not this ingrateful, this doubly-guilty man to an&s;wer for!</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, you know not what God has in &s;tore for you yet!&mdash;But if you are to be puni&s;hed all your days here, for example-&s;ake, in a ca&s;e of &s;uch im|portance, for your one fal&s;e &s;tep, be plea&s;ed to con|&s;ider, That this life is but a &s;tate of probation; and if you have your purification in it, you will have you reward hereafter in a greater degree, for &s;ub|mitting to the di&s;pen&s;ation with patience and re&s;igna|tion.</P>
<P>You &s;ee, my deare&s;t Mi&s;s Clary, that I make no &s;cruple to call the &s;tep you took a fal&s;e one. In <HI>you</HI> it was le&s;s excu&s;eable than it would have been in any other young lady; not only becau&s;e of your &s;uperior talents, but becau&s;e of the oppo&s;ition between <HI>your</HI> character and <HI>his:</HI> So that if you had been provoked to quit your father's hou&s;e, it needed not to have been

<P>After this, it will have an unkind, and, perhaps, at this time, an un&s;ea&s;onable appearance, to expre&s;s my concern, that you have not before favour'd me with a line.&mdash;Yet, if you can account to your&s;elf for your &s;ilence, I dare &s;ay I ought to be &s;atisfied; for I am &s;ure you love me: As I both love and honour you, and ever will, and the more for your misfor|tunes.</P>
<P>One con&s;olation, methinks, I have, even when I am &s;orrowing for your calamities; and that is, that I know not any young per&s;on &s;o qualified to &s;hine the brighter for the trials &s;he may be exerci&s;ed with: And yet it is a con&s;olation that ends in adding to my regrets for your afflictions, becau&s;e you are ble&s;&s;ed with a mind &s;o well able to bear pro&s;perity, and to make every-body round you the better for it.&mdash;<HI>Woe unto him!</HI>&mdash;O this wretched, wretched man!&mdash;But I will forbear till I know more.</P>

<P>Your Lady&s;hip will probably gue&s;s, that the&s;e que&s;tions are not a&s;ked for rea&s;ons favourable to your nephew Lovelace.

<SALUTE>Dear Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Find, that all is not as it &s;hould be between you and my nephew Lovelace. It will very much afflict me, and all his friends, if he has been guilty of any de&s;igned ba&s;ene&s;s to a lady of your character and merit.</P>
<P>We have been long in expectation of an opportu|nity to congratulate you and our&s;elves, upon an event mo&s;t earne&s;tly wi&s;hed for by us all; &s;ince all our hopes of <HI>him</HI> are built upon the power <HI>you</HI> have over him: For if ever man adored a woman, he is that man, and you, Madam, are that woman.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Montague, in her la&s;t letter to me, in an&s;wer to one of mine, inquiring if &s;he knew, from him, whether he could call you his, or was likely &s;oon to
<PB N="25" REF="26">
have that honour; has the&s;e words:
<Q>I know not what to make of my cou&s;in Lovelace, as to the point your Lady&s;hip is &s;o earne&s;t about. He &s;ome|times &s;ays, He is actually married to Mi&s;s Cl. Har|lowe: At other times, that it is her own fault if he be not:&mdash;He &s;peaks of her not only with love, but with reverence: Yet owns, that there is a mi&s;under&s;tanding between them; but confe&s;&s;es, that &s;he is wholly faultle&s;s. An angel, and not a woman, he &s;ays &s;he is: And that no man living can be worthy of her.</Q>&mdash; This is what my niece Montague writes.</P>
<P>God grant, my deare&s;t young lady, that he may not have &s;o heinou&s;ly offended you, that you <HI>cannot</HI> forgive him! If you are not already married, and refu&s;e to be his, I &s;hall lo&s;e all hopes that he ever will marry, or be the man I wi&s;h him to be. So will Lord M. So will Lady Sarah Sadleir.</P>
<P>I will now an&s;wer your que&s;tions: But indeed I hardly know what to write, for fear of widening &s;till more the unhappy difference between you. But yet &s;uch a young lady mu&s;t command every thing from me. This then is my an&s;wer.</P>
<Q><P>I wrote not any letter to him on or about the 7th of June.</P>
<P>Neither I nor my &s;teward know &s;uch a man as Capt. Tomlin&s;on.</P>
<P>I wrote not to my niece to meet me at Reading, nor to accompany me to my cou&s;in Lee&s;on's in town.</P>
<P>My Chancery-affair, tho', like mo&s;t Chancery-affairs, it be of long &s;tanding, is neverthele&s;s now in &s;o good a way, that it cannot give me occa&s;ion to go to town.</P>
<P>Nor have I been in town the&s;e &s;ix months: Nor at Ham&s;tead for &s;everal years.</P>
<P>Neither &s;hall I have any temptation to go to town, except to pay my congratulatory compliments to
<PB N="26" REF="27">
Mrs. Lovelace. On which occa&s;ion I &s;hould go with the greate&s;t plea&s;ure; and &s;hould hope for the favour of your accompanying me to Glen|ham-Hall, for a month at lea&s;t.</P></Q>
<P>Be what will the rea&s;on of your inquiry, let me intreat you, my dear young lady, for Lord M.'s &s;ake; for my &s;ake; for this giddy man's &s;ake, &s;oul as well as body; and for all our family's &s;akes; not to &s;uffer this an&s;wer to widen differences &s;o far as to make you re|fu&s;e him, if already he has not the honour of calling you his; as I am apprehen&s;ive he has not, by your &s;igning by your family-name.</P>
<P>And here let me offer to you my mediation to compo&s;e the difference between you, be it what it will. Your cau&s;e, my dear young lady, cannot be put into the hands of any-body living more devoted to your &s;ervice, than into tho&s;e of</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Monday, July</HI> 3.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Cannot excu&s;e my&s;elf from giving your Lady&s;hip this one trouble more; to thank you, as I mo&s;t heartily do, for your kind letter.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t own to you, Madam, that the honour of being related to Ladies, as eminent for their virtue as for their de&s;cent, was at fir&s;t no &s;mall inducement with me, to lend an ear to Mr. Lovelace's addre&s;s. And the rat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er, as I was determined, had it come to effect, to do every thing in my power to de&s;erve your favourable opinion.</P>
<P>I had another motive, which I knew would of it|&s;elf give me merit with you your whole family; a pre|&s;umptuous
<PB N="29" REF="30">
one (a puni&s;hably pre&s;umptuous one, as it has proved), in the hope that I might be an hum|ble means, in the hand of Providence, to reclaim a man, who had, as I thought, good &s;en&s;e enough at bottom to be reclaimed; or, at lea&s;t, gratitude enough to acknowlege the intended obligation, whe|ther the generous hope were to &s;ucceed, or not.</P>
<P>But I have been mo&s;t egregiou&s;ly mi&s;taken in Mr. Lovelace; the only man, I per&s;uade my&s;elf, pre|tending to be a gentleman, in whom I could have been &s;o <HI>much</HI> mi&s;taken: For while I was endeavour|ing to &s;ave a drowning wretch, I have been, not accidentally, but premeditatedly, and of &s;et purpo&s;e, drawn in after him. And he has had the glory to add to the li&s;t of tho&s;e he has ruined, a name, that, I will be bold to &s;ay, would not have di&s;paraged his own. And this, Madam, by means that would &s;hock humanity to be made acquainted with.</P>
<P>My whole end is &s;erved by your Lady&s;hip's an|&s;wer to the que&s;tions I took the liberty to put to you in writing. Nor have I a wi&s;h to make the unhappy man more odious to you, than is nece&s;&s;ary to excu&s;e my&s;elf for ab&s;olutely declining your offered media|tion.</P>
<P>When your Lady&s;hip &s;hall be informed of the fol|lowing particulars;</P>
<P>That after he had compul&s;atorily, as I may &s;ay, tricked me into the act of going off with him, he could carry me to one of the vile&s;t hou&s;es, as it proved, in London:</P>
<P>That he could be guilty of a wicked attempt, in re&s;entment of which, I found means to e&s;cape from him to Ham&s;tead:</P>
<P>That, after he had found me out there (I know not how), he could procure two women, dre&s;&s;ed out richly, to per&s;onate your Lady&s;hip and Mi&s;s Monta|gue; who, under pretence of engaging me to make a vi&s;it in town to your cou&s;in Lee&s;on (promi&s;ing to
<PB N="30" REF="31">
return with me that evening to Ham&s;tead), betrayed me back again to the vile hou&s;e: Where, again made a pri&s;oner, I was fir&s;t robbed of my &s;en&s;es; and then (why &s;hould I &s;eek to conceal that di&s;grace from others, which I cannot hide from my&s;elf?) of my honour:</P>
<P>When your Lady&s;hip &s;hall know, That, in the &s;hocking progre&s;s to this ruin, wilful fal&s;hoods, re|peated forgeries (particularly of one letter from your Lady&s;hip, another from Mi&s;s Montague, and a third from Lord M.), and numberle&s;s perjuries, were not the lea&s;t of his crimes:</P>
<P>You will judge, That I can have no principles that will make me worthy of an alliance with Ladies of yours and your noble &s;i&s;ter's character, if I could not from my &s;oul declare, that &s;uch an alliance can never <HI>now</HI> take place.</P>
<P>I will not offer to clear my&s;elf intirely of blame: But, as to <HI>him,</HI> I have no fault to accu&s;e my&s;elf of: My crime was, The corre&s;ponding with him at fir&s;t, when prohibited &s;o to do, by tho&s;e who had a right to my obedience; made &s;till more inexcu&s;able, by giving him a clande&s;tine meeting, which put me into the power of his arts. And for this, I am content to be puni&s;hed: Thankful, that at la&s;t I have e&s;caped from him; and have it in my power to reject &s;o wicked a man for my hu&s;band: And glad, if I may be a warning, &s;ince I cannot be an example: Which once (very vain, and very conceited as I was!) I pro|po&s;ed to my&s;elf to be!</P>
<P>All the ill I wi&s;h him is, That he may reform; and that I may be the la&s;t victim to his ba&s;ene&s;s. Perhaps this de&s;irable wi&s;h may be obtained, when he &s;hall &s;ee how his wickedne&s;s, his unmerited wic|kedne&s;s, to a poor creature, made friendle&s;s by his cruel arts, will end.</P>
<P>I conclude with my humble thanks to your Lady|&s;hip,

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Sunday Evening, July</HI> 2.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>HOW kindly, my beloved Mrs. Norton, do you &s;oothe the angui&s;h of a bleeding heart! Surely you are my own mamma; and, by &s;ome unaccount|able mi&s;take, I mu&s;t have been laid to a family, that, having newly found out, or at lea&s;t &s;u&s;pected, the impo&s;ture, ca&s;t me from their hearts, with the in|dignation that &s;uch a di&s;covery will warrant.</P>
<P>O that I had indeed been your own child, born to partake of your humble fortunes, an heire&s;s only to that content in which you are &s;o happy! Then &s;hould I have had a <HI>truly</HI> gentle &s;pirit to have guided my ductile heart, which force and ungenerous u&s;age &s;it &s;o ill upon; and nothing of what has happened would have been.</P>
<P>But let me take heed, that I inlarge not, by im|patience, the breach already made in my duty, by my ra&s;hne&s;s; &s;ince, had I not erred, my <HI>mother,</HI> at lea&s;t, could never have been thought hard-hearted and unforgiving: &mdash; Am I not then an&s;werable, not only for my own faults, but for the con&s;equences of them; which tend to depreciate and bring di&s;grace upon a maternal character never before called in que&s;tion?</P>
<P>It is kind however in you, to endeavour to exte|nuate the fault of one &s;o greatly &s;en&s;ible of it:&mdash;And could it be wiped off intirely, it would render me more worthy of the pains you have taken in my edu|cation: For it mu&s;t add to your grief, as it does to my confu&s;ion, that, after &s;uch promi&s;ing beginnings,
<PB N="32" REF="33">
I &s;hould have &s;o behaved, as to be a di&s;grace in&s;tead of a credit to you, and my other friends.</P>
<P>But that I may not make you think me more guilty than I am, give me leave briefly to a&s;&s;ure you, that when my &s;tory is known, I &s;hall be intitled to more compa&s;&s;ion than blame, even on the &s;core of going away with Mr. Lovelace.</P>
<P>As to all that happened afterwards, let me only &s;ay, that, altho' I mu&s;t call my&s;elf a lo&s;t creature, as to this world, yet have I this con&s;olation left me, that I have not &s;uffered either for want of circum|&s;pection, or thro' credulity, or weakne&s;s. Not one moment was I off my guard, or unmindful of your early precepts. But (having been enabled to baffle many ba&s;e contrivances) I was at la&s;t ruined by arts the mo&s;t inhuman. But had I not been rejected by every friend, this low-hearted man had not dared, nor would have had opportunity, to treat me as he has treated me.</P>
<P>More I cannot, at this time, nor need I, &s;ay: And this I de&s;ire you to keep to your&s;elf, le&s;t re&s;nt|ments &s;hould be taken up, when I am gone, that may &s;pread the evil, which I hope will end with me.</P>
<P>I have been mi&s;informed, you &s;ay, as to my prin|cipal relations being at my uncle Harlowe's. The day, you &s;ay, was not kept. Nor have my brother and Mr. Solmes &mdash; A&s;toni&s;hing&mdash;What complicated wickedne&s;s has his wretched man to an&s;wer for!&mdash; Were I to tell you, you would hardly believe there could have been &s;uch a heart in man&mdash;</P>
<P>But one day you may know my whole &s;tory!&mdash; At pre&s;ent I have neither inclination nor words&mdash;O my bur&s;ting heart!&mdash;Yet a happy, a wi&s;hed relief!&mdash; Were you pre&s;ent, my tears would &s;upply the re&s;t!</P>
<P>I RESUME my pen!</P>
<P>And &s;o you fear no letter will be received from me. But DON'T <HI>grieve to tell me &s;o!</HI> I expect every|thing
<PB N="33" REF="34">
bad!&mdash;And &s;uch is my di&s;tre&s;s, that had you not bid me hope for mercy from the Throne of Mercy, I &s;hould have been afraid, that my father's dreadful cur&s;e would be completed, with regard to both worlds.</P>
<P>For, here, an additional misfortune!&mdash;In a fit of phren&s;ical heedle&s;ne&s;s, I &s;ent a letter to my beloved Mi&s;s Howe, without recollecting her private addre&s;s; and it is fallen into her angry mother's hands: And &s;o that dear friend perhaps has anew incurred di&s;plea|&s;ure on my account. And here too, your worthy &s;on is ill; and my poor Hannah, you think, cannot come to me.&mdash; O my dear Mrs. Norton, <HI>will</HI> you, <HI>can</HI> you, cen&s;ure <HI>tho&s;e</HI> who&s;e re&s;entments again&s;t me Heaven &s;eems to approve of? and will you acquit <HI>her</HI> whom <HI>that</HI> condemns?</P>
<P>Yet you bid me not de&s;pond.&mdash;I will not, if I can help it.&mdash; And, indeed, mo&s;t &s;ea&s;onable con&s;o|lation has your kind letter afforded me.&mdash; Yet to God Almighty do I appeal, to avenge my wrongs, and vindicate my inno&mdash;</P>
<P>But hu&s;hed be my &s;tormy pa&s;&s;ions!&mdash;Have I not but this moment &s;aid, that your letter gave me con|&s;olation? &mdash; May <HI>tho&s;e</HI> be forgiven, who hinder my father from forgiving <HI>me!</HI>&mdash;And this, as to <HI>them,</HI> &s;hall be the har&s;he&s;t thing that &s;hall drop from my pen.</P>
<P>But altho' your &s;on &s;hould recover, I charge you, my dear Mrs. Norton, that you do not think of coming to me. I don't know &s;till, but your media|tion with my mother (altho' at pre&s;ent your interpo|&s;ition would be &s;o little attended to) may be of u&s;e to procure me the revocation of that mo&s;t dreadful part of my father's cur&s;e, which only remains to be ful|filled. The voice of nature mu&s;t at la&s;t be heard in my favour, &s;urely. It will only plead at fir&s;t to my friends in the &s;till, con&s;cious plaintivene&s;s of a young and unhardened beggar! &mdash; But it will grow more
<PB N="34" REF="35">
clamorous when <HI>I</HI> have the courage to be &s;o, and &s;hall demand, perhaps, the paternal protection from further ruin; and that forgivene&s;s, which tho&s;e will be little intitled to expect, for their own faults, who &s;hall interpo&s;e to have it refu&s;ed to me, for a <HI>acci|dental,</HI> not a <HI>premeditated,</HI> error: And which, but for them, I had never fallen into.</P>
<P>But again impatiency, founded, perhaps, on &s;elf-partiality, that &s;trange mi&s;leader! prevails.</P>
<P>Let me briefly &s;ay, that it is nece&s;&s;ary to my pre|&s;ent and future hopes, that you keep well with my family. And, moreover, &s;hould you come, I may be traced out, by your means, by the mo&s;t aban|doned of men. Say not then, that you think you ought to come up to me, <HI>let it be taken as it will:</HI>&mdash; For <HI>my &s;ake,</HI> let me repeat (were my fo&s;ter-brother recovered, as I hope he is), you mu&s;t <HI>not</HI> come. Nor can I want your advice, while <HI>I</HI> can write, and <HI>you</HI> can an&s;wer me. And write I will, as often as I &s;tand in need of your coun&s;el.</P>
<P>Then the people I am now with &s;eem to be both hone&s;t and humane: And there is in the &s;ame hou&s;e a widow-lodger, of low fortunes, but of great merit&mdash; Almo&s;t &s;uch another &s;erious and good woman, as the dear one, to whom I am now writing; who has, as &s;he &s;ays, given over all other thoughts of the world, but &s;uch as &s;hall a&s;&s;i&s;t her to leave it happily.&mdash;How &s;uitable to my own views!&mdash;There &s;eems to be a comfortable providence in <HI>this,</HI> at lea&s;t!&mdash;So that at pre&s;ent there is nothing of exigence; nothing that can <HI>require,</HI> or even <HI>excu&s;e,</HI> your coming, when &s;o many better ends may be an&s;wered by your &s;taying where you are. A time <HI>may</HI> come, when I &s;hall want your la&s;t and be&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance: And <HI>then,</HI> my dear Mrs. Norton &mdash; And <HI>then,</HI> I will be&s;peak it, and em|brace it with my whole heart &mdash; And <HI>then,</HI> will it not be denied me by any-body.</P>
<P>You are very obliging in your offer of money. But
<PB N="35" REF="36">
altho' I was forced to leave my cloaths behind me, yet I took &s;everal things of value with me, which will keep me from pre&s;ent want. You'll &s;ay, I have made a mi&s;erable hand of it &mdash; So indeed I have!&mdash; and, to look backward, in a very little while too.</P>
<P>But what &s;hall I do, if my father cannot be pre|vailed upon to recal his grievous malediction?&mdash;Of all the very heavy evils wherewith I have been af|flicted, this is <HI>now</HI> the heavie&s;t; for I can neither live nor die under it.</P>
<P>O my dear Mrs. Norton, what a weight mu&s;t a father's cur&s;e have upon a mind &s;o apprehen&s;ive of it, as mine is!&mdash;Did I think I &s;hould ever have <HI>this</HI> to deprecate?</P>
<P>But you mu&s;t not be angry with me, that I wrote not to you before. You are very right, and very kind, to &s;ay, You are &s;ure I love you. Indeed I do. And what a genero&s;ity is there (&s;o like your&s;elf) in your prai&s;e, to attribute to me more than I merit, in order to rai&s;e an emulation in me to <HI>de&s;erve</HI> your prai&s;es! &mdash; You tell me, what you expect from me in the calamities I am called upon to bear. May I but behave an&s;werably!</P>
<P>I <HI>can</HI> a little account <HI>to my&s;elf</HI> for my &s;ilence to you, my kind, my dear maternal friend [how equally &s;weetly and politely do you expre&s;s your&s;elf on this occa&s;ion!] &mdash; I was very de&s;irous, for your &s;ake, as well as for my own, that you &s;hould have it to &s;ay, that we did not corre&s;pond: Had they thought we did, every word you could have dropt in my favour, would have been rejected; and my mother would have been forbid to &s;ee you, or to pay any regard to what you &s;hould &s;ay.</P>
<P>They I had &s;ometimes better and &s;ometimes wor&s;e pro&s;pects before me. My wor&s;t would only have troubled you to know: My better made me fre|quently hope, that, by the next po&s;t, or the next, and &s;o on for weeks, I &s;hould have the be&s;t news to
<PB N="36" REF="37">
impart to you, that <HI>then</HI> could happen; cold as the wretch had made my heart to <HI>that Be&s;t.</HI>&mdash;For how could I think to write to you, with a confe&s;&s;ion, that I was not married, yet lived in the hou&s;e (nor could I help it) with &s;uch a man?&mdash;Who likewi&s;e had given it out to &s;everal, that we were actually mar|ried, altho' with re&s;trictions that depended on the reconciliation with my friends? And to di&s;gui&s;e the truth, or be guilty of a fal&s;hood either direct or equi|vocal, that was what you had never learnt me.</P>
<P>But I might have written to you for advice, in my precarious &s;ituation, perhaps you will think. But, indeed, my dear Mrs. Norton, I was not lo&s;t for want of advice. And this will appear clear to you, from what I have already hinted, were I to explain my&s;elf no further:&mdash; For what need had the cruel &s;poiler to have had recour&s;e to unprecedented arts&mdash;I will &s;peak out plainer &s;till (but you mu&s;t not at pre|&s;ent report it); to &s;tupefying potions, and to the mo&s;t brutal and outrageous force; had I been want|ing in my duty?</P>
<P>A few words more upon this grievous &s;ubject&mdash;</P>
<P>When I reflect upon all that has happened to me, it is apparent, that this generally-&s;uppo&s;ed <HI>thought|le&s;s</HI> &s;educer, has acted by me upon a regular and preconcerted plan of villainy.</P>
<P>In order to &s;et all his vile plots in motion, nothing was wanting from the fir&s;t, but to prevail upon me, either by force or fraud, to throw my&s;elf into his power: And when this was effected, nothing le&s;s than the intervention of the paternal authority (which I had not de&s;erved to be exerted in my behalf) could have &s;aved me from the effect of his deep machina|tions. Oppo&s;ition from any other quarter would but too probably have precipitated his barbarous and in|grateful violence: And had <HI>you your&s;elf</HI> been with me, I have rea&s;on <HI>now</HI> to think, that &s;ome-how or other you would have &s;uffered in endeavouring to &s;ave me:
<PB N="37" REF="38">
For never was there, as now I &s;ee, a plan of wicked|ne&s;s more &s;teadily and uniformly pur&s;ued, than <HI>his</HI> has been, again&s;t an unhappy creature, who merited better of <HI>him:</HI> But the Almighty has thought fit, ac|cording to the general cour&s;e of his providence, to make the fault bring on its own puni&s;hment: And that, perhaps, in con&s;equence of my father's dread|ful imprecation, "That I might be puni&s;hed <HI>here</HI>" [O my mamma Norton, pray with me, that <HI>here</HI> it &s;top!] <Q>by the very wretch in whom I had placed my wicked confidence!</Q></P>
<P>I am &s;orry, for your &s;ake, to leave off &s;o heavily. Yet the re&s;t mu&s;t be brief.</P>
<P>Let me de&s;ire you to be &s;ecret in what I have com|municated to you; at lea&s;t, till you have my con|&s;ent to divulge it.</P>
<P>God pre&s;erve to you your more faultle&s;s child!</P>
<P>I will hope for His mercy, altho' I &s;hould not ob|tain that of any other per&s;on.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Monday Night, July</HI> 3.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>O The barbarous villainly of this dete&s;table man!</P>
<P>And is there a man in the world, who could offer violence to &s;o &s;weet a creature!</P>
<P>And are you &s;ure you are now out of his reach?</P>
<P>You command me to keep &s;ecret the particulars of the vile treatment you have met with; or el&s;e, upon an unexpected vi&s;it which Mi&s;s Harlowe fa|voured
<PB N="38" REF="39">
me with, &s;oon after I had received your me|lancholy letter, I &s;hould have been tempted to own I had heard from you, and to have communicated to her &s;uch parts of your two letters as would have de|mon&s;trated your penitence, and your earne&s;tne&s;s to obtain the revocation of your father's malediction, as well as his protection from outrages, that may &s;till be offered to you. But then your &s;i&s;ter would pro|bably have expected a &s;ight of the letters, and even to been have permitted to take them with her to the family.</P>
<P>Yet they <HI>mu&s;t</HI> one day be acquainted with the &s;ad &s;tory:&mdash;And it is impo&s;&s;ible but they mu&s;t pity you, and forgive you, when they know your early peni|tence, and your unprecedented &s;ufferings; and that you have fallen by the brutal force of a barbarous ravi&s;her, and not by the vile arts of a &s;educing lover.</P>
<P>The wicked man gives it out, at Lord M.'s, as Mi&s;s Harlowe tells me, that he is actually married to you:&mdash;Yet &s;he believes it not; nor had I the heart to let her know the truth.</P>
<P>She put it clo&s;e to me, Whether I had not cor|re&s;ponded with you from the time of your going away? I could &s;afely tell her (as I did), that I had not: But I &s;aid, that I was well informed, that you took extremely to heart your father's imprecation; and that, if &s;he would excu&s;e me, I would &s;ay, it would be a kind and &s;i&s;terly part, if &s;he would u&s;e her intere&s;t to get you di&s;charged from it.</P>
<P>Among other &s;evere things, &s;he told me, that my partial fondne&s;s for you made me very little con&s;ider the honour of the re&s;t of the family: But, if I had not heard this from you, &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed I was &s;et on by Mi&s;s Howe.</P>
<P>She expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf with a good deal of bitterne&s;s again&s;t that young lady: Who, it &s;eems, every-where, and to every-body (for you mu&s;t think, that your &s;tory is the &s;ubject of all conver&s;ations), rails
<PB N="39" REF="40">
again&s;t your family; treating them, as your &s;i&s;ter &s;ays, with contempt, and even with ridicule.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry &s;uch angry freedoms are taken, for two rea&s;ons; fir&s;t, Becau&s;e &s;uch liberties never do any good. I have heard you own, that Mi&s;s Howe has a &s;atiri|cal vein; but I &s;hould hope, that a young lady of her &s;en&s;e, and right ca&s;t of mind, mu&s;t know, that the end of &s;atire is not to exa&s;perate, but amend; and &s;hould never be per&s;onal. If it be, as my good father u&s;ed to &s;ay, it may make an impartial per&s;on &s;u&s;pect, that the &s;atiri&s;t has a natural &s;pleen to gra|tify; which may be as great a fault in <HI>him,</HI> as any of tho&s;e which he pretends to cen&s;ure and expo&s;e in <HI>others.</HI></P>
<P>Perhaps a hint of this from you, will not be thrown away.</P>
<P>My &s;econd rea&s;on is, That the&s;e freedoms, from &s;o warm a friend to you as Mi&s;s Howe is known to be, are mo&s;t likely to be charged to your account.</P>
<P>My re&s;entments are &s;o &s;trong again&s;t this vile&s;t of men, that I dare not touch upon the &s;hocking par|ticulars which you mention, of his ba&s;ene&s;s. What defence, indeed, could there be again&s;t &s;o determined a wretch, after you were in his power? I will only repeat my earne&s;t &s;upplication to you, that, black as appearances are, you will not de&s;pair. You cala|mities are exceeding great, but then you have ta|lents proportioned to your trials. This every-body allows.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e the wor&s;t, and that your family will not be moved in your favour, your cou&s;in Morden will &s;oon arrive, as Mi&s;s Harlowe told me. If he &s;hould even be got over to their &s;ide, he will however &s;ee ju&s;tice done you; and then may you live an exem|plary life, making hundreds happy, and teaching young ladies to &s;hun the &s;nares in which you have been &s;o dreadfully intangled.</P>
<P>As to the man you have lo&s;t, Is an union with
<PB N="40" REF="41">
&s;uch a perjured heart as his with &s;uch an admirable one as yours, to be wi&s;hed for? A ba&s;e, <HI>low-hearted</HI> wretch, as you ju&s;tly call him, with all his pride of ance&s;try; and more an enemy to him&s;elf, with re|gard to his pre&s;ent and future happine&s;s, than to you, in the barbarous and ingrateful wrongs he has done you; I need not, I am &s;ure, exhort you to de&s;pi&s;e &s;uch a man as this; &s;ince not to be able to do &s;o, would be a reflection upon a &s;ex to which you have always been an honour.</P>
<P>Your moral character is untainted: The very na|ture of your &s;ufferings, as you well ob&s;erve, demon|&s;trates <HI>that.</HI> Chear up, therefore, your dear heart, and do not de&s;pair: For is it not GOD who governs the world, and permits &s;ome things, and directs others, as He plea&s;es? And will he not reward <HI>tem|porary &s;ufferings,</HI> innocently incurred, and piou&s;ly &s;upported, with <HI>eternal felicity?</HI> &mdash; And what, my dear, is this poor needle's point of NOW to a <HI>bound|le&s;s</HI> ETERNITY?</P>
<P>My heart, however, labours under a double af|fliction: For my poor boy is very, very bad!&mdash;A violent fever!&mdash;Nor can it be brought to intermit! &mdash; Pray for <HI>him,</HI> my deare&s;t Mi&s;s; &mdash; for his recovery, if God &s;ee fit. &mdash; I hope God <HI>will</HI> &s;ee fit?&mdash;If not (how can I bear to &s;uppo&s;e That!)&mdash; pray for <HI>me,</HI> that he will give me that patience and re&s;ignation, which I have been wi&s;hing to you.

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Thur&s;day, July</HI> 6.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Ought not, e&s;pecially at this time, to add to your afflictions&mdash;But yet I cannot help communicating
<PB N="41" REF="42">
to you (who now are my <HI>only</HI> &s;oothing friend) a new trouble that has befallen me.</P>
<P>I had but one friend in the world, be&s;ides you; and &s;he is utterly di&s;plea&s;ed with me <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See the next Letter.</NOTE>: It is griev|ous, but for one moment, to lie under a beloved per&s;on's cen&s;ure; and this through imputations that affect one's honour and prudence. There are points &s;o delicate, you know, my dear Mrs. Norton, that it is a degree of di&s;honour to have a vindication of one's &s;elf from them appear to be <HI>nece&s;&s;ary.</HI> In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, my misfortune is, that I know not how to account, but by gue&s;s (&s;o &s;ubtle have been the workings of the dark &s;pirit I have been unhap|pily intangled by), for &s;ome of the facts that I am called upon to explain.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Howe, in &s;hort, &s;uppo&s;es &s;he has found a flaw in my character. I have ju&s;t now received her &s;evere letter: But I &s;hall an&s;wer it, perhaps, in bet|ter temper, if I fir&s;t con&s;ider yours. For indeed my patience is almo&s;t at an end. And yet I ought to con&s;ider, <HI>That faithful are the wounds of a friend.</HI> But &s;o <HI>many</HI> things at once! &mdash; O, my dear Mrs. Norton, how &s;hall &s;o young a &s;cholar in the &s;chool of affliction be able to bear &s;uch heavy and &s;uch va|rious evils!</P>
<P>But to leave this &s;ubject for a while, and turn to your letter.</P>
<P>I am very &s;orry Mi&s;s Howe is &s;o lively in her re|&s;entments on my account. I have always blamed her very freely for her liberties of this &s;ort, with my friends. I once had a good deal of influence over her kind heart, and &s;he made all I &s;aid a law to her. But people in calamity have but little weight in any-thing, or with any-body. Pro&s;perity and independ|ence are charming things on this account, that they give force to the coun&s;els of a friendly heart; while
<PB N="42" REF="43">
it is thought in&s;olence in the mi&s;erable to advi&s;e, or &s;o much as remon&s;trate.</P>
<P>Yet is Mi&s;s Howe an invaluable per&s;on: And is it to be expected, that &s;he &s;hould pre&s;erve the &s;ame regard for my judgment, that &s;he had before I for|feited all title to di&s;cretion? With what face can I take upon me to reproach a want of prudence in <HI>her?</HI> But if I can be &s;o happy as to re-e&s;tabli&s;h my&s;elf in her ever-valued opinion, I &s;hall endeavour to inforce upon her your ju&s;t ob&s;ervations on this head.</P>
<P>You need not, you &s;ay, exhort me to de&s;pi&s;e &s;uch a man as him, by whom I have &s;uffered:&mdash;Indeed&punc; you need not: For I would choo&s;e the cruelle&s;t death, rather than to be his. And yet, my dear Mrs. Norton, I will own to you, that once I could have loved him&mdash; Ingrateful man! &mdash; had he permitted me, I <HI>once</HI> could have loved him. Yet he never de&s;erved my love. And was not this a fault? But now, if I can but keep out of his hands, and procure the revocation of my father's malediction, it is all I wi&s;h for.</P>
<P>Reconciliation with my friends I do not expect; nor pardon from them; at lea&s;t, till in extremity, and as a <HI>viaticum.</HI></P>
<P>O, my beloved Mrs. Norton, you cannot imagine what I have &s;uffered!&mdash;But indeed my heart is bro|ken! I am &s;ure I &s;hall not live to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that independence, which you think would enable me to atone in &s;ome mea&s;ure for my pa&s;t conduct.</P>
<P>While this is my opinion, you may believe, I &s;hall not be ea&s;y, till I can procure the revocation of that dreadful cur&s;e; and, if po&s;&s;ible, a la&s;t forgivene&s;s.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h to be left to take my own cour&s;e, in en|deavouring to procure this grace. Yet know I not, at pre&s;ent, what that cour&s;e &s;hall be.</P>
<P>I will write. But to <HI>whom</HI> is my doubt. Cala|mity has not yet given me the a&s;&s;urance to addre&s;s my&s;elf to my FATHER. My UNCLES (well as they
<PB N="43" REF="44">
once loved me) are hard-hearted. They never had their ma&s;culine pa&s;&s;ions humanized by the tender name of FATHER. Of my BROTHER I have no hope. I have then but my MOTHER, and my SIS|TER, to whom I can apply.&mdash;<Q>And may I not, my deare&s;t Mamma, be permitted to lift up my trembling eye, to your all-chearing, and your once <HI>more</HI> than indulgent, your <HI>fond</HI> eye, in hopes of &s;ea&s;onable mercy, to the poor &s;ick heart, that yet beats with life drawn from your own dearer heart? &mdash; E&s;pecially when pardon only, and not re&s;toration, is implored?</Q></P>
<P>Yet were I able to engage my mother's pity, would it not be a means to make <HI>her</HI> &s;till more unhappy, than I have already made her, by the oppo&s;ition &s;he would meet with, were &s;he to try to give force to that pity?</P>
<P>To my SISTER, then, I think, I will apply &mdash; Yet how hard hearted has my &s;i&s;ter been!&mdash;But I will not a&s;k for protection; and yet I am in hourly dread, that I &s;hall want protection. &mdash; All I will a&s;k for, &s;hall be only to be freed from the heavy cur&s;e, that has operated as far as it <HI>can</HI> operate, as to <HI>this</HI> life. &mdash;And &s;urely, it was pa&s;&s;ion, and not intention, that carried it &s;o very far, as to the <HI>other!</HI></P>
<P>But why do I thus add to your di&s;tre&s;&s;es? &mdash; It is not, my dear Mrs. Norton, that I have &s;o <HI>much</HI> feeling for my <HI>own</HI> calamity, that I have <HI>none</HI> for <HI>yours:</HI> Since yours is indeed an addition to my own. But you have one con&s;olation (a very great one) which I have not:&mdash;That <HI>your</HI> afflictions, whether re&s;pect|ing your <HI>more</HI> or your <HI>le&s;s</HI> de&s;erving child, ri&s;e not from any fault of your own.</P>
<P>But what can I do for you more than pray?&mdash;A&s;|&s;ure your&s;elf, that in every &s;upplication I put up for my&s;elf, I will, with equal fervor, remember both you and your &s;on. For I am, and ever will be,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Wedne&s;day, July</HI> 5.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE><HI>My dear</HI> CLARISSA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have at la&s;t heard from you from a quarter I little expected.</P>
<P>From my mamma.</P>
<P>She had for &s;ome time &s;een me unea&s;y and grieving; and ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;ed it was about you. And this morn|ing dropt a hint, which made me conjecture that &s;he mu&s;t have heard &s;omething of you, more than I knew. And when &s;he found that this added to my unea&s;ine&s;s, &s;he owned &s;he had a letter in her hands of yours, dated the 29th of June, directed for me.</P>
<P>You may gue&s;s, that this occa&s;ion'd a little warmth, that could not be wi&s;hed for by either.</P>
<P>[It is &s;urpri&s;ing, my dear, <HI>mighty</HI> &s;urpri&s;ing! that, knowing the prohibition I lay under of corre&s;ponding with you, you could &s;end a letter for me to our own hou&s;e: Since it mu&s;t be fifty to one that it would fall into my mother's hands, as you find it did.]</P>
<P>In &s;hort, <HI>&s;he</HI> re&s;ented that I &s;hould di&s;obey her: <HI>I</HI> was as much concerned that &s;he &s;hould open and with-hold from me <HI>my</HI> letters: And at la&s;t &s;he was plea&s;ed to compromi&s;e the matter with me, by giving up the letter, and permitting me to write to you <HI>once</HI> or <HI>twice;</HI> &s;he to &s;ee the contents of what I wrote. For, be&s;ides the value &s;he has for you, &s;he could not but have a great curio&s;ity to know the oc|ca&s;ion of &s;o &s;ad a &s;ituation, as your melancholy let|ter &s;hews you to be in.</P>
<P>[But I &s;hall get her to be &s;atisfied with hearing me read what I write; putting in between hooks, thus [], what I intend not to read to her.]</P>
<P>Need I to remind you, Mi&s;s Cl. Harlowe, of <HI>three</HI> letters I wrote to you, to none of which I had any
<PB N="45" REF="46">
an&s;wer; except to the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> and that a few lines only, promi&s;ing a letter at large; tho' you were well enough, the day after you received my <HI>&s;econd,</HI> to go joyfully back again with him to the vile hou&s;e? But more of the&s;e by-and-by. I mu&s;t ha&s;ten to take notice of your letter of Wedne&s;day la&s;t week; which you could <HI>contrive</HI> &s;hould fall into my mother's hands.</P>
<P>Let me tell you, that that letter has almo&s;t broken my heart. Good God! what have you brought your&s;elf to, Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe?&mdash;Could I have believed, that after you had e&s;caped from the mi&s;|creant (with &s;uch mighty pains and earne&s;tne&s;s e&s;caped), and after &s;uch an attempt as he had made, you would have been prevailed upon, not only to forgive him, but (without being married too) to re|turn with him to that horrid hou&s;e!&mdash;A hou&s;e I had given you &s;uch an account of!&mdash;Surpri&s;ing!&mdash;What an intoxicating thing is <HI>this Love?</HI>&mdash;I <HI>always</HI> feared, that You, even You, were not proof again&s;t it.</P>
<P>You your <HI>be&s;t &s;elf</HI> have not e&s;caped! &mdash; Indeed I &s;ee not how you could expect to e&s;cape.</P>
<P><HI>What a tale have you to unfold!</HI> &mdash; You need not un|fold it, my dear: I would have engaged to progno&s;ti|cate all that has happen'd, had you but told me, that you would once more have put your&s;elf into his power, after you had taken &s;uch pains to get out of it.</P>
<P><HI>Your peace is de&s;troyed!</HI>&mdash;I wonder not at it: Since now you mu&s;t reproach your&s;elf for a credulity &s;o ill-placed.</P>
<P><HI>Your intellect is touch'd!</HI>&mdash;I am &s;ure my heart bleeds for you: But, excu&s;e me, my dear, I doubt your intellect was touch'd before you left Ham&s;tead; or you would never have let him find you out there; or, when he did, &s;uffer him to prevail upon you to return to the horrid brothel.</P>
<P><HI>I tell you,</HI> I &s;ent you <HI>three letters:</HI> The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of which, dated the 7th and 8th of June <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. <HI>iv.</HI> p. <HI>328.</HI></NOTE> (for it was

<P>She indeed &s;u&s;pected it before: And &s;o &s;he very well might; know|ing Me, and knowing my love of You.</P>
<P>She has &s;o much real concern for your misfortunes, that, thinking it will be a con&s;olation to <HI>you,</HI> and that it will oblige <HI>me,</HI> &s;he con|&s;ents that you &s;hall write to me the <HI>particulars at large of your &s;ad &s;tory:</HI> But it is on condition, that I &s;hew her all that has pa&s;&s;ed between us, relating to your&s;elf and the vile&s;t of men: I have the more chearfully complied, as the communication cannot be to your di&s;advantage.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVIII. <HI>Mi&s;s</HI> CLARISSA HARLOWE, <HI>To Mi&s;s</HI> HOWE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Thur&s;day, July</HI> 6.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>FEW young per&s;ons have been able to give more convincing proofs than my&s;elf, how little true happine&s;s lies in the enjoyment of our own wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>To produce one in&s;tance only of the truth of this ob|&s;ervation; What would I have given for weeks pa&s;t, for the favour of a letter from my dear Mi&s;s Howe, in who&s;e friend&s;hip I placed all my remaining comfort? Little did I think, that the next letter &s;he would honour me with, &s;hould be in &s;uch a &s;tile, as &s;hould make me look more than once at the &s;ub&s;cription, that I might be &s;ure (the name not being written at length) that it was not &s;igned by another A. H. For &s;urely, thought I, this is my &s;i&s;ter Arabella's &s;tyle: Surely Mi&s;s Howe (blame me as &s;he plea&s;es in other points) could never repeat &s;o <HI>&s;harply</HI> upon her friend, words written in the bitterne&s;s of &s;pirit, and in the di&s;order of head; nor remind her, with a&s;perity, and with mingled &s;trokes of wit, of an argument held in the gaiety of an heart elated with pro&s;perous fortunes (as
<PB N="49" REF="50">
mine then was), and very little apprehen&s;ive of the &s;evere turn that argument would one day take again&s;t her&s;elf.</P>
<P>But what have <HI>I,</HI> &s;unk in my fortunes; my cha|racter forfeited; my honour lo&s;t [While <HI>I</HI> know it, I care not <HI>who</HI> knows it]; de&s;titute of friends, and even of hope; What have <HI>I</HI> to do to &s;hew a &s;pirit of repining and expo&s;tulation to a dear friend, becau&s;e &s;he is not <HI>more</HI> kind than a &s;i&s;ter?&mdash;</P>
<P>I find, by the ri&s;ing bitterne&s;s which will mingle with the gall in my ink, that I am not yet &s;ubdued enough to my condition: And &s;o, begging your par|don, that I &s;hould rather have formed my expecta|tions of favour from the indulgence you <HI>u&s;ed</HI> to &s;hew me, than from what I <HI>now de&s;erve</HI> to have &s;hewn me, I will endeavour to give a particualr an&s;wer to your letter; altho' it will take me up too much time to think of &s;ending it by your me&s;&s;enger to-morrow: He can put off his journey, he &s;ays, till Saturday. I will endeavour to have the whole narrative ready for you by Saturday.</P>
<P>But how to defend my&s;elf in every thing that has happened, I cannot tell: Since in &s;ome part of the time, in which my conduct appears to have been cen|&s;urable, I was not my&s;elf; and to this hour know not all the methods taken to deceive and ruin me.</P>
<P>You tell me, that in your fir&s;t letter you gave me &s;uch an account of the vile hou&s;e I was in, and &s;uch cautions about that Tomlin&s;on, as make you won|der how I could think of going back.</P>
<P>Alas, my dear! I was trick'd, mo&s;t vilely trick'd back, as you &s;hall hear in its place.</P>
<P>Without <HI>knowing</HI> the hou&s;e was &s;o very <HI>vile</HI> a hou&s;e from your <HI>intended</HI> information, I di&s;liked the people too much, ever <HI>voluntarily</HI> to have returned to it. But had you really written &s;uch cautions about Tomlin&s;on, and the hou&s;e, as you &s;eem to have <HI>pur|po&s;ed</HI> to do, they mu&s;t, had they come in time, have
<PB N="50" REF="51">
been of infinite &s;ervice to me. But not one word of either, whatever was your <HI>intention,</HI> did you men|tion to me, in that <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of the <HI>three</HI> letters you &s;o warmly TELL ME you <HI>did</HI> &s;end me. <HI>I will inclo&s;e it to convince you</HI> <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">The letter &s;he inclo&s;es was Mr. Lovelace's forged one. See Vol. <HI>v.</HI> p. <HI>94,</HI> &amp; &s;eq.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But your account of your me&s;&s;enger's delivering to me your &s;econd letter, and the de&s;cription he gives of me, as <HI>lying upon a couch, in a &s;trange way, bloated and flu&s;h-coloured, you don't know how,</HI> ab&s;olutely puzzles and confounds me.</P>
<P>Lord have mercy upon the poor Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe! What can this mean!&mdash;<HI>Who</HI> was the me&s;&s;enger you &s;ent? Was <HI>he</HI> one of Lovelace's creatures too! &mdash; Could no-body come near me but that man's con|federates, either <HI>&s;etting out &s;o,</HI> or <HI>made &s;o?</HI>&mdash;I know not what to make of any one &s;yllable of this!&mdash;In|deed I don't!</P>
<P>Let me &s;ee. You &s;ay, this was <HI>before</HI> I went from Ham&s;tead!&mdash;My intellects had not then been touch'd!&mdash;Nor had I ever been &s;urpri&s;ed by wine (&s;trange if I had!): How then could I be found in &s;uch a <HI>&s;trange way, bloated, and flu&s;h-coloured; you don't know how!</HI> &mdash; Yet what a vile, what a hateful figure has your me&s;&s;enger repre&s;ented me to have made!</P>
<P>But indeed, I know nothing of ANY me&s;&s;enger from you.</P>
<P>Believing my&s;elf &s;ecure at Ham&s;tead, I &s;taid longer there than I would have done, in hopes of the letter promi&s;ed me in your &s;hort one of the 9th, brought me by my own me&s;&s;enger, in which you undertake to &s;end for and engage Mrs. Town&s;end in my fa|vour <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. <HI>v.</HI> p. <HI>88.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>I wonder'd I heard not from you: And was told you were &s;ick; and, at another time, that your
<PB N="51" REF="52">
mother and you had had words on my account, and that you had refu&s;ed to admit Mr. Hickman's vi&s;its upon it: So that I &s;uppo&s;ed at one time, that you was not <HI>able</HI> to write; at another, that your mo|ther's prohibition had its <HI>due</HI> force with you. But now I have no doubt, that the wicked man mu&s;t have intercepted your letter; and I wi&s;h he found not means to <HI>corrupt your me&s;&s;enger</HI> to tell you &s;o &s;trange a &s;tory.</P>
<P>It was on Sunday June 11. you &s;ay, that the man gave it me. I was at church twice that day with Mrs. Moore. Mr. Lovelace was at her hou&s;e the while, where he boarded, and wanted to have lodged; but I would not permit that, tho' I could not help the other. In one of the&s;e &s;paces <HI>it mu&s;t be</HI> that he had time to work upon the man. You'll ea&s;ily, my dear, find that out, by inquiring the time of his arrival at Mrs. Moore's, and other circum&s;tances of the <HI>&s;trange way</HI> he pretended to &s;ee me in, <HI>on a couch,</HI> and the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Had any-body &s;een me afterwards, when I was betray'd back to the vile hou&s;e, &s;truggling under the operation of wicked potions, and robb'd <HI>indeed</HI> of my intellects (for this, as you &s;hall hear, was my dreadful ca&s;e!), I might then, perhaps, have ap|peared <HI>bloated,</HI> and <HI>flu&s;h-coloured,</HI> and <HI>I know not how my&s;elf.</HI> But were you to &s;ee your poor Clari&s;&s;a <HI>now</HI> (or even to have &s;een her at Ham&s;tead, <HI>before</HI> &s;he &s;uffered the vile&s;t of all outrages), you would not think her <HI>bloated,</HI> or <HI>flu&s;h-coloured:</HI> Indeed you would not.</P>
<P>In a word, it could not be <HI>me</HI> your me&s;&s;enger &s;aw; nor (if any-body) who it was can I divine.</P>
<P>I will now, as <HI>briefly</HI> as the &s;ubject will permit, enter into the darker part of my &s;ad &s;tory: And yet I mu&s;t be &s;omewhat circum&s;tantial, that you may not think me capable of <HI>re&s;erve</HI> or <HI>palliation.</HI> The <HI>latter</HI> I am not con&s;cious that I need.

inexcu&s;eable, were I guilty of the <HI>former</HI> to you. And yet, if you knew how my heart &s;inks under the thoughts of a recollection &s;o painful, you would pity me.</P>
<P>As I &s;hall not be able, perhaps, to conclude what I have to write in even two or three letters, I will be|gin a new one, with my &s;tory; and &s;end the whole of it together, altho' written at different periods, as I am able.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIX. Mi&s;s <HI>CLARISSA HARLOWE,</HI> To Mi&s;s <HI>HOWE.</HI> [Referred to in Vol. V. p. 222.]</HEAD>

<P>HE had found me out at Ham&s;tead: Strangely found me out; for I am &s;till at a lo&s;s to know by what means.</P>
<P>I was loth, in my billet of the 9th <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. <HI>V.</HI> p. <HI>98, 99.</HI></NOTE>, to tell you &s;o, for fear of giving you apprehen&s;ions for me; and be|&s;ides, I hoped then to have a &s;horter and happier i&s;&s;ue account to you for, thro' your a&s;&s;i&s;tance, than I met with.</P>
<Q>She then gives a narrative of all that pa&s;&s;ed at Ham|&s;tead between her&s;elf, Mr. Lovelace, Capt. Tomlin|&s;on and the women there, to the &s;ame effect with that &s;o amply given by Mr. Lovelace.</Q>
<P>Mr. Lovelace, finding all he could &s;ay, and all Capt. Tomlin&s;on could urge, ineffectual, to prevail upon me to forgive an outrage &s;o flagrantly premeditated; re&s;ted all his hopes on a vi&s;it which was to be paid me by Lady Betty Lawrance and Mi&s;s Montague.</P>
<P>In my uncertain &s;ituation, my pro&s;pects all &s;o dark, I knew not to whom I might be obliged to have recour&s;e in the la&s;t re&s;ort: And as tho&s;e ladies had the be&s;t of cha|racters, in&s;omuch that I had rea&s;on to regret, that I had not from the fir&s;t thrown my &s;elf upon their protection (when I had forfeited <HI>that</HI> of my own friends), I thought
<PB N="53" REF="54">
I would not <HI>&s;hun</HI> an interview with them, though I was too indifferent to their kin&s;man, to <HI>&s;eek</HI> it, as I doubted not, that one end of their vi&s;it would be to reconcile me to him.</P>
<P>On Monday the 12th of June, the&s;e pretended ladies came to Ham&s;tead, and I was pre&s;ented to them, and they to me, by their kin&s;man.</P>
<P>They were richly dre&s;&s;ed, and &s;tuck out with jewels; the pretended Lady Betty's were particularly very fine.</P>
<P>They came in a coach and four, hired, as was con|fe&s;&s;ed, while their own was repairing in town: A pre|tence made, I now perceive, that I &s;hould not gue&s;s at the impo&s;ture by the want of the real Lady's arms upon it. Lady Betty was attended by her woman, whom &s;he called Morri&s;on; a mode&s;t country-looking per&s;on.</P>
<P>I had heard, that Lady Betty was a fine woman, and that Mi&s;s Montague was a beautiful young lady, genteel, and graceful, and full of vivacity: Such were the&s;e im|po&s;tors; and having never &s;een either of them, I had not the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion, that they were not the ladies they per&s;onated; and being put a little out of countenance by the richne&s;s of their dre&s;&s;es, I could not help, fool that I was! to apologize for my own.</P>
<P>The pretended Lady Betty then told me, that her ne|phew had acquainted them with the &s;ituation of affairs between us. And altho' &s;he could not but &s;ay, that &s;he was very glad, that he had not put &s;uch a &s;light upon his Lord&s;hip and them, as report had given them cau&s;e to ap|prehend (the rea&s;ons for which report, however, &s;he much approved of); yet it had been matter of great concern to her, and to her niece Montague, and would to the whole family, to find &s;o great a mi&s;under&s;tanding &s;ub&s;i&s;ting be|tween us, as, if not made up, might di&s;tance all their hopes.</P>
<P>She could ea&s;ily tell who was in fault, &s;he &s;aid.&mdash; And gave him a look both of anger and di&s;dain; a&s;king him, How it was po&s;&s;ible for him to give an offence of <HI>&s;uch</HI> a nature to &s;o charming a lady (&s;o &s;he called me), as &s;hould occa&s;ion a re&s;entment &s;o &s;trong?</P>
<P>He pretended to be awed into &s;hame and &s;ilence.</P>
<P>My deare&s;t niece, &s;aid &s;he, and took my hand (I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> call you niece, as well from love, as to humour your un|cle's
<PB N="54" REF="55">
laudable expedient), permit me to be, not an advo|cate, but a mediatrix for him; and not for his &s;ake, &s;o much as for my own, my Charlotte's, and all our family's. The indignity he has offered to you, may be of too ten|der a nature to be inquired into. But as he declares, that it was not a premeditated offence; whether, my dear (for I was going to ri&s;e upon it in my temper), it were or not; and as he declares his &s;orrow for it (and never did creature expre&s;s a deeper &s;orrow for any offence than he!); and as it is a reparable one; let <HI>Us,</HI> for this one time, forgive him; and thereby lay an obligation upon this man of errors&mdash;Let US, I &s;ay, my dear: For, Sir (turn|ing to him), an offence again&s;t &s;uch a peerle&s;s lady as This, mu&s;t be an offence again&s;t <HI>me,</HI> again&s;t your <HI>cou&s;in,</HI> here; and again&s;t <HI>all the virtuous</HI> of our Sex.</P>
<P>See, my dear, what a creature he had picked out! Could you have thought there was a woman in the world who could thus expre&s;s her&s;elf, and yet be vile? But &s;he had her principal in&s;tructions from him, and tho&s;e written down too, as I have rea&s;on to think: For I have recollected &s;ince, that I once &s;aw this Lady Betty (who often ro&s;e from her &s;eat, and took a turn to the other end of the room with &s;uch emotion as if the joy of her heart would not let her &s;it &s;till) take out a paper from her &s;tays, and look into it, and put it there again. She might oftener, and I not ob&s;erve it; for I little thought, that there could be &s;uch impo&s;tors in the world.</P>
<P>I could not forbear paying great attention to what &s;he &s;aid. I found tears ready to &s;tart; I drew out my hand|kerchief, and was &s;ilent. I had not been &s;o indulgently treated a great while by a per&s;on of character and di&s;tin|ction (&s;uch I thought her), and dur&s;t not tru&s;t to the accent of my voice.</P>
<P>The pretended Mi&s;s Montague joined in, on this occa|&s;ion; and, drawing her chair clo&s;e to me, took my other hand, and be&s;ought me to forgive her cou&s;in; and con&s;ent to rank my&s;elf as one of the principals of a family, that had long, very long, coveted the honour of my alliance.</P>
<P>I am a&s;hamed to repeat to you, my dear, now I know what wretches they are, the tender, the obliging, and the re&s;pectful things I &s;aid to them.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="56">The wretch him&s;elf then came forward. He threw him&s;elf at my feet. How was I be&s;et!&mdash;The women gra&s;ping one my right hand, the other my left: The pre|tended Mi&s;s Montague pre&s;&s;ing to her lips more than once the hand &s;he held: The wicked man on his knees, imploring my forgivene&s;s; and &s;etting before me my happy and my unhappy pro&s;pects, as I &s;hould forgive or not forgive him. All that he thought would affect me in his former pleas, and tho&s;e of Capt. Tomlin&s;on, he repeated. He vowed, he promi&s;ed, he be&s;poke the pre|tended ladies to an&s;wer for him; and they engaged their honours in his behalf.</P>
<P>Indeed, my dear, I was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, perfectly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. I was &s;orry that I had given way to this vi&s;it. For I knew not how, in tenderne&s;s to relations (as I thought them) &s;o worthy, to treat &s;o freely as he de&s;erved, a man nearly allied to them:&mdash;So that my arguments, and my re&s;olutions, were deprived of their greate&s;t force.</P>
<P>I pleaded, however, my application to you. I expected every hour, I told them, an an&s;wer from you to a letter I had written, which would decide my future de&s;tiny.</P>
<P>They offered to apply to you them&s;elves in per&s;on, in <HI>their own behalf,</HI> as they politely termed it. They be|&s;ought me to write to you to ha&s;ten your an&s;wer.</P>
<P>I &s;aid, I was &s;ure, that you would write the moment that the event of an application to be made to a third per&s;on enabled you to write.&mdash;But as to the &s;ucce&s;s of their re|que&s;ts in behalf of their kin&s;man, That depended not upon the expected an&s;wer; for <HI>that,</HI> I begged their pardon, was out of the que&s;tion. I wi&s;hed him well. I wi&s;hed him happy. But I was convinced, that I neither could make <HI>him</HI> &s;o, nor he <HI>me.</HI></P>
<P>Then, again, how the wretch promi&s;ed!&mdash;How he vow|ed!&mdash;How he intreated!&mdash;And how the women pleaded! And they engaged them&s;elves, and the honour of their whole family, for his ju&s;t, his kind, his tender behaviour to me.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, my dear, I was &s;o hard &s;et, that I was obliged to come to a more favourable compromi&s;e with them, than I had intended. I would wait for your an&s;wer to my letter, I &s;aid: And if it made doubtful or difficult

<HEAD>LETTER XX. Mi&s;s <HI>CLARISSA HARLOWE;</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS very ill, and obliged to lay down my pen. I thought I &s;hould have fainted. But am better now&mdash;So will proceed.</P>
<P>The pretended Ladies, the more we talked, &s;eemed to be the fonder of me. And <HI>The</HI> Lady Betty had Mrs. Moore called up; and a&s;ked her, If &s;he had accommodations for her niece and &s;elf, her woman, and two men-&s;ervants, for three or four days?</P>
<P>Mr. Lovelace an&s;wered for her, that &s;he had.</P>
<P>She would not a&s;k her dear niece Lovelace [<HI>Permit me, my dear,</HI> whi&s;pered &s;he, <HI>this charming &s;tyle before &s;trangers! &mdash;I will keep your uncle's &s;ecret</HI>] whether &s;he &s;hould be welcome or not to be &s;o near her. But for the time &s;he &s;hould &s;tay in the&s;e parts, &s;he would come up every night&mdash;What &s;ay <HI>you,</HI> niece Charlotte?</P>
<P>The pretended Charlotte an&s;wered, &s;he &s;hould like to do &s;o, of all things.</P>
<P><HI>The</HI> Lady Betty called her an obliging girl. She liked the placed, &s;he &s;aid. Her cou&s;in Lee&s;on would excu&s;e her. The air, and my company, would do her good. She ne|ver cho&s;e to lie in the &s;moaky town, if &s;he could help it. In &s;hort, my dear, &s;aid &s;he to me, I will &s;tay till you hear from Mi&s;s Howe; and till I have your con&s;ent to go with me to Glenham-Hall. Not one moment will I be out of your company, when I can have it. Stedman my &s;olicitor, as the di&s;tance from town is &s;o &s;mall, may attend me here for in&s;tructions. Niece Charlotte, one word with you, child.</P>
<P>They retired to the farther end of the room, and talked about their night-dre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P><HI>The</HI> Mi&s;s Charlotte &s;aid, Morri&s;on might be di&s;patched for them.</P>
<P>True, the other &s;aid:&mdash;But &s;he had &s;ome letters in
<PB N="58" REF="59">
her private box, which &s;he mu&s;t have up. And you know, Charlotte, that I tru&s;t nobody with the keys of that.</P>
<P>Could not Morri&s;on bring up that box?</P>
<P>No. She thought it &s;afe&s;t where it was. She had heard of a robbery committed but two days ago, at the foot of Ham&s;tead-hill; and &s;he &s;hould be ruined, if &s;he lo&s;t her box.</P>
<P>Well then, it was but going to town to undre&s;s, and &s;he would leave her jewels behind her, and return; and &s;hould be the ea&s;ier a great deal on all accounts.</P>
<P>For my part, I wondered they came up with them. But that was to be taken as a re&s;pect paid to me. And then they hinted at another vi&s;it of ceremony which they had thought to make, had they not found me &s;o inex|pre&s;&s;ibly engaging.</P>
<P>They talked loud enough for me to hear them; on purpo&s;e, no doubt, tho' in affected whi&s;pers; and con|cluded with high prai&s;es of me.</P>
<P>I was not fool enough to believe, or to be puffed up with their encomiums; yet not &s;u&s;pecting them, I was not di&s;plea&s;ed at &s;o favourable a beginning of acquaint|ance with ladies (whether I were to be related to them or not) of whom I had always heard honourable men|tion. And yet at the time, I thought, highly as they exalted <HI>me,</HI> that in &s;ome re&s;pects (tho' I hardly knew in what) they fell &s;hort of what I expected <HI>them</HI> to be.</P>
<P>The grand deluder was at the farther end of the room, another way; probably to give me an opportunity to hear the&s;e preconcerted prai&s;es&mdash;looking into a book, which, had there not been a preconcert, would not have taken his attention for one moment. It was <HI>Taylor's Holy Living and Dying.</HI></P>
<P>When the pretended ladies joined me, he approached me, with it in his hand&mdash;A &s;mart book, This, my dear! &mdash;This old divine affects, I &s;ee, a mighty flowery &s;tile upon a very &s;olemn &s;ubject. But it puts me in mind of an ordinary country funeral, where the young women, in honour of a defunct companion, e&s;pecially if &s;he were a virgin, or <HI>pa&s;&s;ed for &s;uch,</HI> make a flower-bed of her coffin.</P>
<P>And then, laying down the book, turning upon his
<PB N="59" REF="60">
heel, with one of his u&s;ual airs of gaiety, And are you determined, Ladies, to take up your lodgings with my charming creature?</P>
<P>Indeed they were.</P>
<P>Never were there more cunning, more artful impo&s;tors, than the&s;e women. Practi&s;ed creatures, to be &s;ure: Yet genteel; and they mu&s;t have been well-educated&mdash;Once, perhaps, as much the delight of their parents, as I was of mine: And who knows by what arts ruined, body and mind!&mdash;O my dear! how pregnant is this reflection!</P>
<P>But the <HI>man!</HI>&mdash;Never was there a man &s;o deep! Never &s;o con&s;ummate a deceiver! except that dete&s;ted Tomlin|&s;on; who&s;e years, and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, joined with a &s;olidity of &s;en&s;e and judgment, that &s;eemed uncommon, gave him, one would have thought, advantages in villainy, the other had not time for. Hard, very hard, that I &s;hould fall into the knowlege of two &s;uch wretches; when two more &s;uch I hope are not to be met with in the world:&mdash;Both &s;o determined to carry on the mo&s;t bar|barous and perfidious projects again&s;t a poor young crea|ture, who never did or wi&s;hed harm to either!</P>
<P>Take the following &s;light account of the&s;e womens and of this man's behaviour to each other before me.</P>
<P>Mr. Lovelace carried him&s;elf to his pretended aunt with high re&s;pect, and paid a great deference to all &s;he &s;aid. He permitted her to have all the advantage over him in the repartees and retorts that pa&s;&s;ed between them. I could, indeed, ea&s;ily &s;ee, that it <HI>was</HI> permitted; and that he forbore that <HI>acumen,</HI> that quickne&s;s, which he never &s;pared &s;hewing to the pretended Mi&s;s Montague; and which a man of wit &s;eldom knows how to &s;pare &s;hewing, when an opportunity offers to di&s;play his wit.</P>
<P>The pretended Mi&s;s Montague was &s;till more reverent in her behaviour to her aunt. While the aunt kept up the dignity of the character &s;he had a&s;&s;umed, raillying both of them with the air of a per&s;on who depends upon the &s;uperiority which years and fortune give over younger per&s;ons; who might have a view to be obliged to her, either in her life, or at her death.</P>
<P>The &s;everity of her raillery, however, was turned upon Mr. Lovelace, on occa&s;ion of the character of the
<PB N="60" REF="61">
people who kept the lodgings, which, &s;he &s;aid, I had thought my &s;elf &s;o well warranted to leave privately.</P>
<P>This &s;tartled me. For having then no &s;u&s;picion of the vile Tomlin&s;on, I concluded (and your letter of the 7th <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">His forged letter. See Vol. <HI>V.</HI> p. <HI>94.</HI></NOTE> favoured my conclu&s;ions), that if the hou&s;e were notorious, either he, or Mr. Mennell, would have given me or him &s;ome hints of it&mdash;Nor, altho' I liked not the people, did I ob&s;erve any thing in them very culpable, till the Wedne&s;day night before, that they offered not to come to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, altho' within hearing of my di|&s;tre&s;s (as I am &s;ure they were), and having as much rea&s;on to be frighted as I, at the fire, had it been real.</P>
<P>I looked with indignation upon Mr. Lovelace, at this hint.</P>
<P>He &s;eemed aba&s;hed. I have not patience, but to re|collect the &s;pecious looks of this vile deceiver. But how was it po&s;&s;ible, that even this florid countenance of his &s;hould enable him to command a blu&s;h at his plea&s;ure? For blu&s;h he did, more than once: And the blu&s;h, on this occa&s;ion, was a deep-dyed crim&s;on, un&s;trained for, and natural, as I thought&mdash;But he is &s;o much of the actor, that he &s;eems able to enter into any character; and his mu&s;cles and features appear intirely under obe|dience to his wicked will <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">It is proper to ob&s;erve, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t there was a more natural rea&s;on than this that the lady gives, for Mr. Lovelace's blu&s;hing. It was a blu&s;h of indign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tion, as he owned afterwards to his friend Belford, in conver&s;ation; for his pretended aunt had mi&s;taken her cue, in con|demning the hou&s;e; and he had much ado to recover the blunder; being obliged to follow her lead, and vary from his fir&s;t de&s;ign; which was, To have the people of the hou&s;e &s;poken well of, in order to induce her to return to it, were it but on pretence to direct her cloaths to be carr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed to Ham&s;tead.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The pretended Lady went on, &s;aying, She had taken upon her&s;elf to inquire after the people, on hearing that I had left the hou&s;e in di&s;gu&s;t; and tho' &s;he heard not any thing much ami&s;s, yet &s;he heard enough to make her wonder, that he would carry his &s;pou&s;e, a per&s;on of &s;o much delicacy, to a hou&s;e, that, if it had not a <HI>bad</HI> fame, had not a <HI>good</HI> one.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t think, my dear, that I liked the pretended Lady Betty the better for this. I &s;uppo&s;e it was de&s;igned I &s;hould.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="62">He was &s;urpri&s;ed, he &s;aid, that her Lady&s;hip &s;hould hear a bad character of the people. It was what he had never before heard that they de&s;erved. It was ea&s;y, indeed, to &s;ee, that they had not very great delicacy, tho' they were not indelicate. The nature of their livelihood, letting lodgings, and taking people to board (and yet he had under&s;tood that they were nice in the&s;e particulars), led them to aim at being free and obliging: And it was difficult, he &s;aid, for per&s;ons of chearful di&s;po&s;i|tions, &s;o to behave, as to avoid cen&s;ure: Openne&s;s of heart and countenance in the Sex (more was the pity!) too often &s;ubjected good people, who&s;e fortunes did not &s;et them above the world, to uncharitable cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>He wi&s;hed, however, that her Lady&s;hip would tell <HI>what</HI> &s;he had heard: Altho' now it &s;ignified but little, becau&s;e he would never a&s;k me to &s;et foot within their doors again: And he begged &s;he would not mince the matter.</P>
<P>Nay, no great matter, &s;he &s;aid. But &s;he had been informed, that there were more women lodgers in the hou&s;e than men: Yet that their vi&s;itors were more men than women. And this had been hinted to her (perhaps by ill-willers, &s;he could not an&s;wer for that) in &s;uch a way, as if &s;omewhat further were meant by it, than was &s;poken.</P>
<P>This, he &s;aid, was the true innuendo way of characteri|zing, u&s;ed by detractors. Every-body and every-thing had a black and a white &s;ide, as ill-willers and well-willers were plea&s;ed to report. He had ob&s;erved, that the front hou&s;e was well lett, and he believed, more to the one &s;ex, than to the other; for he had &s;een, occa&s;ionally pa&s;&s;ing to and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">o, &s;everal genteel mode&s;t-looking women; and who, it was very probable, were not &s;o ill-beloved, but they might have vi&s;itors and relations of both &s;exes: But they were none of them any-thing to us, or we to them: We were not once in any of their companies: But in the genteele&s;t and mo&s;t retired hou&s;e of the two, which we had in a manner to our&s;elves, with the u&s;e of a parlour to the &s;treet, to &s;erve us for a &s;ervants hall, or to receive common vi&s;itors, or our traders only, whom we admitted not up-&s;tairs.</P>
<P>He always loved to &s;peak as he found. No man in
<PB N="62" REF="63">
the world had &s;uffered more from calumny than he him|&s;elf had done.</P>
<P>Women, he owned, ought to be more &s;crupulous than men needed to be where they lodged. Neverthele&s;s, he wi&s;hed, that fact, rather than &s;urmi&s;e, were to be the foundation of their judgments, e&s;pecially when they &s;poke of one another.</P>
<P>He meant no reflection upon her Lady&s;hip's informants, or rather <HI>&s;urmi&s;ants</HI> (as he might call them), be they who they would: Nor did he think him&s;elf obliged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> defend characters impeached, or not thought well of, by women of virtue and honour. Neither were the&s;e peo|ple of importance enough to have &s;o much &s;aid abou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> them.</P>
<P>The pretended Lady Betty &s;aid, All who knew he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> would clear her of cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s: That it gave <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ome opinion, &s;he mu&s;t needs &s;ay, of the people, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he had continued there &s;o long with me; that I had r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+ther <HI>negative</HI> than <HI>po&s;itive</HI> rea&s;ons of di&s;like to them and that &s;o &s;hrewd a man, as &s;he heard Capt. Tomli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+&s;on was, had not objected to them.</P>
<P>I think, niece Charlotte, proceeded &s;he, as my n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+phew has not parted with the&s;e lodgings, you and I (fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> as my dear Mi&s;s Harlowe <HI>di&s;likes</HI> the people, I would n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a&s;k <HI>her</HI> for her company) will take a di&s;h of tea with m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> nephew there, before we go out of town, and then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hall &s;ee what &s;ort of people they are.

<P>What &s;ay <HI>you,</HI> cou&s;in Lovelace? Lady Sarah, tho' melancholy woman, is very inqui&s;itive about all yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> affairs. I mu&s;t acquaint her with every particular <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|cum&s;tance when I go down.</P>
<P>With all his heart. He would attend her whene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;he plea&s;ed. She would &s;ee very hand&s;ome apartmen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and very civil people.</P>
<P>The duce is in them, &s;aid <HI>The</HI> Mi&s;s Montague, if th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> appear other to us.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="64">They then fell into family-talk: Family-happine&s;s on my hope-for acce&s;&s;ion into it. They mentioned Lord M.'s and Lady Sarah's great de&s;ire to &s;ee me. How many friends and admirers, with up-lift hands, I &s;hould have! [<HI>O my dear, what a triumph mu&s;t the&s;e creatures, and he, have over the poor Devoted all the time!</HI>]&mdash;What a happy man he would be&mdash;They would not, <HI>The</HI> Lady Betty &s;aid, give them&s;elves the mortification but to &s;uppo&s;e, that I &s;hould not be one of Them!</P>
<P>Pre&s;ents were hinted at. She re&s;olved that I &s;hould go with her to Glenham-Hall. She would not be refu&s;ed, altho' &s;he were to &s;tay a week beyond her time for me.</P>
<P>She long'd for the expected letter from you. I mu&s;t write to ha&s;ten it, and to let Mi&s;s Howe know how every thing &s;tood &s;ince I wrote la&s;t. That might di&s;po&s;e me ab&s;olutely in <HI>their</HI> favour, and in her nephew's; and then &s;he hoped there would be no occa&s;ion for me to think of entering upon any new mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>Indeed, my dear, I did at the time intend, if I heard not from you by morning, to di&s;patch a man and hor&s;e to you, with the particulars of <HI>all,</HI> that you might (if you thought proper), at lea&s;t, put off Mrs. Town&s;end's coming up to another day.&mdash;But I was mi&s;erably pre|vented.</P>
<P>She made me promi&s;e, that I would write to you upon this &s;ubject, whether I heard from you, or not. One of her &s;ervants &s;hould ride po&s;t with my letter, and wait for Mi&s;s Howe's an&s;wer.</P>
<P>She then launched out in de&s;erved prai&s;es of you, my dear. How fond &s;hould &s;he be of the honour of your acquaintance!</P>
<P>The pretended Mi&s;s Montague joined in with her, as well for her&s;elf as for her &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Abominably well-in&s;tructed were they both.</P>
<P>O my dear! What ri&s;ques may poor giddy girls run, when they throw them&s;elves out of the protection of their natural friends, and into the wide world?</P>
<P>They then talked again of reconciliation and intimacy with every one of my friends; with my mother particu|larly; and gave the dear good lady the prai&s;es that every one gives her, who has the happine&s;s to know her.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="65">Ah, my dear Mi&s;s Howe! I had almo&s;t forgot my re|&s;entments again&s;t the pretended nephew!&mdash;So many agreeable things &s;aid, made me think, that, if you &s;hould advi&s;e it, and if I could bring my mind to forgive the wretch for an outrage &s;o <HI>premeditatedly</HI> vile, and could forbear de&s;pi&s;ing him for that and his other ingrate|ful and wicked ways, I might not be unhappy in an al|liance with &s;uch a family.

<P>But amid&s;t all the&s;e delightful pro&s;pects, I mu&s;t not, &s;aid <HI>The</HI> Lady Betty, forget that I am to go to town.</P>
<P>She then ordered her coach to be got to the door&mdash; We will all go to town together, &s;aid &s;he, and return together.

<P>Nothing but the height to affectionate complai&s;ance pa&s;&s;ed all the way: Over and over, What a joy would this unexpected vi&s;it give her cou&s;in Lee&s;on! What a plea&s;ure mu&s;t it be to &s;uch a mind as mine, to be able to give &s;o much joy to every-body I came near!</P>
<P>The cruel, the &s;avage &s;educer (as I have &s;ince recol|lected) was in rapture all the way; but yet &s;uch a &s;ort of rapture, as he took vi&s;ible pains to check.</P>
<P>Hateful villain!&mdash;How I abhor him! &mdash; What mi&s;chief mu&s;t be then in his plotting heart!&mdash;What a devoted victim mu&s;t I be in all their eyes!</P>
<P>Though not plea&s;ed, I was neverthele&s;s ju&s;t then thoughtle&s;s of danger; they endeavouring thus to lift me up above all apprehen&s;ion of that, and above my&s;elf too.</P>
<P>But think, my dear, what a dreadful turn all had upon me, when, through &s;everal &s;treets and ways I knew no|thing of, the coach, &s;lackening its pace, came within &s;ight of the dreadful hou&s;e of the dreadfulle&s;t woman in the world; as &s;he proved to me.</P>
<P>Lord be good unto me! cry'd the poor fool, looking out of the coach&mdash;Mr. Lovelace!&mdash;Madam! turning to the pretended aunt&mdash;Madam! turning to the niece, my eyes and hands lifted up &mdash; Lord be good unto me!</P>
<P>What! What! What, my dear!</P>

<P>I was afraid I &s;hould have fallen into fits: But &s;till re|fu&s;ed to go out&mdash;Man!&mdash;Man!&mdash;Man! cry'd I, ga&s;ping|ly, my head out of the coach and in, by turns, half a dozen times running, drive on!&mdash;Let us go!</P>

accounting for it; for &s;till I did not &s;u&s;pect the&s;e wo|men. But the antipathy I had taken to the vile hou&s;e, and to find my&s;elf &s;o near it, when I expected no &s;uch matter, with the &s;ight of the old creature, all together, made me behave like a di&s;tracted per&s;on.</P>
<P>The hart&s;horn and water was brought. The pretended lady Betty made me drink it. Heaven knows if there were any thing el&s;e in it!</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, &s;aid &s;he, whi&s;peringly, I mu&s;t &s;ee what &s;ort of creatures the <HI>nieces</HI> are. Want of delicacy cannot be hid from me. You could not &s;urely, my dear, have this aver&s;ion to re-enter a hou&s;e, for a few minutes, in our company, in which you lodged and boarded &s;everal weeks, unle&s;s the&s;e women could be &s;o pre&s;umptuou&s;ly vile, as my nephew ought not to know.</P>
<P>Out &s;tept the pretended lady; the &s;ervant, at her command, having opened the door.</P>
<P>Deare&s;t Madam, &s;aid the other, let me follow you (for I was next the door.) Fear nothing: I will not &s;tir from your pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>Come, my dear, &s;aid the pretended Lady: Give me your hand; holding out hers. Oblige me this once!</P>
<P>I will ble&s;s your foot&s;teps, &s;aid the old creature, if once more you honour my hou&s;e with your pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>A croud by this time was gathered about us; but I was too much affected to mind that.</P>
<P>Again the pretended Mi&s;s Montague urged me (&s;tand|ing up as ready to go out if I would give her room). Lord, my dear, &s;aid &s;he, who can bear this croud?&mdash; What will people think?</P>
<P>The pretended Lady again pre&s;&s;ed me, with both her hands held out&mdash;Only, my dear, to give orders about your things.</P>
<P>And thus pre&s;&s;ed, and gazed at (for then I looked about me), the women &s;o richly dre&s;&s;ed, people whi&s;per|ing; in an evil moment, out &s;tepp'd I, trembling, forced to lean with both my hands (frighted too much for ce|remony) on the pretended Lady Betty's arm&mdash;O that I had dropped down dead upon the guilty thre&s;hold!</P>
<P>We &s;hall &s;tay but a few minutes, my dear!&mdash;but a few minutes! &s;aid the &s;ame &s;pecious jilt&mdash;out of breath with
<PB N="69" REF="70">
her joy, as I have &s;ince thought, that they had thus triumphed over the unhappy victim!</P>
<P>Come, Mrs. Sinclair, I think your name is, &s;hew us the way&mdash;following her, and leading me. I am very thir&s;ty. You have frighted me, my dear, with your &s;trange fears. I mu&s;t have tea made, if it can be done, in a moment. We have further to go, Mrs. Sinclair, and mu&s;t return to Ham&s;tead this night.</P>
<P>It &s;hall be ready in a moment, cry'd the wretch. We have water boiling.</P>
<P>Ha&s;ten, then&mdash;Come, my dear, to me, as &s;he led me through the pa&s;&s;age to the fatal inner hou&s;e&mdash;Lean upon me&mdash;How you tremble!&mdash;how you faulter in your &s;teps! &mdash;Deare&s;t niece Lovelace (the old wretch being in hear|ing), why the&s;e hurries upon your &s;pirits?&mdash;We'll begone in a minute.</P>
<P>And thus &s;he led the poor &s;acrifice into the old wretch's too well-known parlour.</P>
<P>Never was any-body &s;o gentle, &s;o meek, &s;o low-voiced, as the odious woman; drawing out, in a puling accent, all the obliging things &s;he could &s;ay: Awed, I then thought, by the con&s;cious dignity of a woman of quality; glittering with jewels.</P>
<P>The called for tea was ready pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>There was no Mr. Belton, I believe: For the wretch went not to any-body, unle&s;s it were while we were parlying in the coach. No &s;uch per&s;on, however, ap|peared at the tea-table.</P>
<P>I was made to drink two di&s;hes, with milk, complai|&s;antly urged by the pretended Ladies helping me each to one. I was &s;tupid to their hands; and, when I took the tea, almo&s;t choaked with vapours; and could hardly &s;wallow.</P>
<P>I thought, <HI>tran&s;iently</HI> thought, that the tea, the la&s;t di&s;h particularly, had an odd ta&s;te. They, on my pa|lating it, ob&s;erved, that the milk was <HI>London milk;</HI> far &s;hort in goodne&s;s of what they were accu&s;tomed to from their own dairies.</P>
<P>I have no doubt, that my two di&s;hes, and perhaps my hart&s;horn, were prepared for me; in which ca&s;e it was more proper for their purpo&s;e, that <HI>they</HI> &s;hould help me,
<PB N="70" REF="71">
than that I &s;hould help <HI>my&s;elf.</HI> Ill before, I found my|&s;elf &s;till more and more di&s;ordered in my head; a heavy torpid pain increa&s;ing fa&s;t upon me. But I imputed it to my terror.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, at the pretended Ladies motion, I went up &s;tairs, attended by Dorcas; who affected to weep for joy, that once more &s;he &s;aw my <HI>ble&s;&s;ed</HI> face, that was the vile creature's word; and immediately I &s;et about taking out &s;ome of my cloaths, ordering what &s;hould be put up, and what &s;ent after me.</P>
<P>While I was thus employed, up came the pretended Lady Betty, in a hurrying way&mdash;My dear, you won't be long before you are ready. My nephew is very bu&s;y in writing an&s;wers to his letters: So, I'll ju&s;t whip away, and change my dre&s;s, and call upon you in an in&s;tant.</P>
<P>O Madam!&mdash;I <HI>am</HI> ready! I am <HI>now</HI> ready!&mdash;You mu&s;t not leave me here: And down I &s;unk, affrighted, into a chair.</P>
<P>This in&s;tant, this in&s;tant, I will return&mdash;Before you can be ready&mdash;Before you can have packed up your things&mdash;We would not be late&mdash;The robbers we have heard of may be out&mdash;Don't let us be late.</P>
<P>And away &s;he hurried before I could &s;ay another word&punc; Her pretended niece went with her, without taking no|tice to me of her going.</P>
<P>I had no &s;u&s;picion yet, that the&s;e women were no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> indeed the Ladies they per&s;onated; and I blamed my&s;elf for my weak fears.&mdash;It cannot <HI>be,</HI> thought I, that <HI>&s;uch</HI> Ladies will abet treachery again&s;t a poor creature they are &s;o fond of. They mu&s;t undoubtedly <HI>be</HI> the per&s;ons they <HI>appear</HI> to be&mdash;What folly to doubt it! The air, the dre&s;s, the dignity, of women of quality.&mdash;How un|worthy of them, and of my charity, concluded I, is this ungenerous &s;hadow of &s;u&s;picion!</P>
<P>So, recovering my &s;tupified &s;pirits, as well as they could be recovered (for I was heavier and heavier; and wondered to Dorcas, what ailed me; rubbing my eyes, and taking &s;ome of her &s;nuff, pinch after pinch, to very little purpo&s;e), I pur&s;ued my employment: But whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that was over, all packed up that I de&s;igned to be packed up; and I had nothing to do but to <HI>think;</HI> and found

them tarry &s;o long; I thought I &s;hould have gone di&s;|tracted. I &s;hut my&s;elf into the chamber that had been mine; I kneeled, I prayed; yet knew not what I prayed for: Then ran out again: It was almo&s;t dark night, I &s;aid: Where, where, was Mr. Lovelace?</P>
<P>He came to me, taking no notice at fir&s;t of my con|&s;ternation and wildne&s;s (What they had given me made me incoherent and wild): All goes well, &s;aid he, my dear!&mdash;A line from Captain Tomlin&s;on!</P>
<P>All indeed did go well for the villainous project of the mo&s;t cruel and mo&s;t villainous of men!</P>
<P>I <HI>demanded</HI> his aunt!&mdash;I <HI>demanded</HI> his cou&s;in!&mdash;The evening, I &s;aid, was clo&s;ing!&mdash;My head was very, <HI>very</HI> bad, I remember, I &s;aid.&mdash;And it grew wor&s;e and wor&s;e.</P>
<P>Terror, however, as yet kept up my &s;pirits; and I in&s;i&s;ted upon his going him&s;elf to ha&s;ten them.</P>
<P>He called his &s;ervant. He raved at the <HI>&s;ex</HI> for <HI>their</HI> delay: 'Twas well that bu&s;ine&s;s of con&s;equence &s;eldom depended upon &s;uch parading, unpunctual triflers!</P>
<P>His &s;ervant came.</P>
<P>He ordered him to fly to his cou&s;in Lee&s;on's; and to let his aunt and cou&s;ins know how unea&s;y we both were at their delay: Adding, of his own accord, De&s;ire them, if they don't come in&s;tantly, to &s;end their coach, and we will go without them. Tell them I wonder they'll &s;erve me &s;o!</P>
<P>I thought this was con&s;iderately and fairly put. But now, indifferent as my head was, I had a little time to con&s;ider the man, and his behaviour. He terrified me with his looks, and with his violent emotions, as he gazed upon me. Evident <HI>joy-&s;uppre&s;&s;ed</HI> emotions, as I have &s;ince recollected. His &s;entences &s;hort, and pro|nounced as if his breath were touched. Never &s;aw I his abominable eyes look, as then they looked&mdash;Tri|umph in them!&mdash;Fierce and wild; and more di&s;agree|able than the womens at the vile hou&s;e appeared to me, when I fir&s;t &s;aw them: And at times, &s;uch a leering, mi&s;chief-boding ca&s;t!&mdash;I would have given the world to have been an hundred miles from him. Yet his behaviour was de|cent&mdash;A decency, however, that I might have &s;een to be &s;truggled for&mdash;For he &s;natched my hand two or three
<PB N="72" REF="73">
times, with a vehemence in his gra&s;p that hurt me; &s;peaking words of tenderne&s;s through his &s;hut teeth, as it &s;eemed; and let it go, with a beggar-voic'd humble accent, like the vile woman's ju&s;t before; half-inward; yet his words and manner carrying the appearance of &s;trong and almo&s;t convul&s;ed pa&s;&s;ion!&mdash;O my dear! What mi&s;chiefs was he not then meditating!</P>
<P>I complained once or twice of thir&s;t. My mouth &s;eemed parched. At the time, I &s;uppo&s;ed, that it was my terror (ga&s;ping often as I did for breath) that parched up the roof of my mouth. I called for water: Some table-beer was brought me: Beer, I &s;uppo&s;e, was a better ve|hicle (if I were not do&s;ed enough before) for their po|tions. I told the maid, That &s;he knew I &s;eldom ta&s;ted malt-liquor: Yet, &s;u&s;pecting nothing of this nature, being extremely thir&s;ty, I drank it, as what came next: And in|&s;tantly, as it were, found my&s;elf much wor&s;e than before; as if inebriated, I &s;hould fancy: I know not how.</P>
<P>His &s;ervant was gone twice as long as he needed: And, ju&s;t before his return, came one of the pretended Lady Betty's, with a letter for Mr. Lovelace.</P>
<P>He &s;ent it up to me. I read it: And then it was that I thought my&s;elf a lo&s;t creature; it being to put off her going to Ham&s;tead that night, on account of violent fits which Mi&s;s Montague was pretended to be &s;eized with: For then immediately came into my head his vile at|tempt upon me in this hou&s;e; the revenge that my flight might too probably in&s;pire him with on that occa&s;ion, and becau&s;e of the difficulty I made to forgive him, and to be reconciled to him; his very looks wild, and dread|ful to me; and the women of the hou&s;e &s;uch as I had more rea&s;on than ever, even from the pretended Lady Betty's hints, to be afraid of: All the&s;e crouding together in my apprehen&s;ive mind, I fell into a kind of phren&s;y.</P>
<P>I have not remembrance how I was, for the time it la&s;ted: But I know, that, in my fir&s;t agitations, I pulled off my head-dre&s;s, and tore my ruffles in twenty tatters and ran to find him out.</P>
<P>When a little recovered, I in&s;i&s;ted upon the hint he had given of their coach. But the me&s;&s;enger, he &s;aid, had told him, that it was &s;ent to fetch a phy&s;ician, le&s;t hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> chariot &s;hould be put up, or not ready.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="74">I then in&s;i&s;ted upon going directly to Lady Betty's lodgings.</P>
<P>Mrs. Lee&s;on's was now a crouded hou&s;e, he &s;aid: And as my earne&s;tne&s;s could be owing to nothing but ground|le&s;s apprehen&s;ion [And O what vows, what prote&s;tations of his honour did he then make!], he hoped I would not add to their pre&s;ent concern. Charlotte, indeed, was u&s;ed to fits, he &s;aid, upon any great &s;urprizes, whether of joy or grief; and they would told her for a week to|gether, if not got off in a few hours.</P>
<P>You are an <HI>ob&s;erver of eyes,</HI> my dear, &s;aid the villain; perhaps in &s;ecret in&s;ult: Saw you not in Mi&s;s Montague's now-and-then, at Ham&s;tead, &s;omething wildi&s;h?&mdash;I was afraid for her then&mdash;Silence and quiet only do her good: Your concern for <HI>her,</HI> and her love for <HI>you,</HI> will but augment the poor girl's di&s;order, if you &s;hould go.</P>
<P>All impatient with grief and apprehen&s;ion, I &s;till de|clared my&s;elf re&s;olved not to &s;tay in that hou&s;e till morn|ing. All I had in the world, my rings, my watch, my little money, for a coach! or, if one were not to be got. I would go on foot to Ham&s;tead that night, tho' I walked it by my&s;elf.</P>
<P>A coach was hereupon &s;ent for, or pretended to be &s;ent for. Any price, he &s;aid, he would give to oblige me, late as it was; and he would attend me with all his &s;oul.&mdash;Buy no coach was to be got.</P>
<P>Let me cut &s;hort the re&s;t. I grew wor&s;e and wor&s;e in my head; now &s;tupid, now raving, now &s;en&s;ele&s;s. The vile&s;t of vile women was brought to frighten me. Never was there &s;o horrible a creature as &s;he appeared to me at the time.</P>
<P>I remember, I pleaded for mercy&mdash;I remember that I &s;aid <HI>I would be his&mdash;Indeed I would be his</HI>&mdash;to obtain his mercy&mdash;But no mercy found I!&mdash;My &s;trength, my in|tellects, failed me!&mdash;And then &s;uch &s;cenes followed&mdash;O my dear, &s;uch dreadful &s;cenes!&mdash;Fits upon fits (faintly indeed, and imperfectly remembered) procuring me no compa&s;&s;ion&mdash;But death was with-held from me. That would have been too great a mercy!</P>
<P>THUS was I tricked and deluded back by blacker hearts of my own &s;ex, than I thought there were in the world;
<PB N="74" REF="75">
who appeared to me to be per&s;ons of honour: And, when in his power, thus barbarou&s;ly was I treated by this vil|lainous man!</P>
<P>I was &s;o &s;en&s;ele&s;s, that I dare not averr, that the hor|rid creatures of the hou&s;e were per&s;onally aiding and abetting: But &s;ome vi&s;ionary remembrances I have of fe|male figures, flitting, as I may &s;ay, before my &s;ight; the wretched woman's particularly. But as the&s;e con|fu&s;ed ideas might be owing to the terror I had conceived of the wor&s;e than ma&s;culine violence &s;he had been per|mitted to a&s;&s;ume to me, for expre&s;&s;ing my abhorrence of her hou&s;e; and as what I &s;uffered from his barbarity wants not that aggravation; I will &s;ay no more on a &s;ub|ject &s;o &s;hocking as this mu&s;t ever be to my remembrance.</P>
<P>I never &s;aw the per&s;onating wretches afterwards. He per&s;i&s;ted to the la&s;t (dreadfully invoking heaven as a wit|ne&s;s to the truth of his a&s;&s;ertion), that they were really and truly the Ladies they pretended to be; declaring, that they could not take leave of me, when they left the town, becau&s;e of the &s;tate of &s;en&s;ele&s;ne&s;s and phren&s;y I was in. For their intoxicating, or rather &s;tupefying, potions, had almo&s;t deleterious effects upon my intel|lects, as I have hinted; in&s;omuch that, for &s;everal days together, I was under a &s;trange delirium; now moping, now dozing, now weeping, now raving, now &s;cribbling, tearing what I &s;cribbled, as fa&s;t as I wrote it: <HI>Mo&s;t</HI> mi|&s;erable when now-and-then a ray of rea&s;on brought con|fu&s;edly to my remembrance what I had &s;uffered.</P>

<P>The very hour that I found my&s;elf in a place of &s;afety, I took pen to write to you. When I began, I de&s;igned only to write &s;ix or eight lines, to inquire after your health: For, having heard nothing from you, I feared <HI>indeed,</HI> that you <HI>had been,</HI> and <HI>&s;till were,</HI> too ill to write. But no &s;ooner did my pen begin to blot the paper, but my &s;ad heart hurried it into length. The apprehen&s;ions I had lain under, that I &s;hould not be able to get away; the fa|tigue I had in effecting my e&s;cape; the difficulty of pro|curing a lodging for my&s;elf; having di&s;liked the people of two hou&s;es, and tho&s;e of a third di&s;liking me; for you mu&s;t think I made a frighted appearance&mdash;The&s;e, together with the recollection of what I had &s;uffered from him, and my farther apprehen&s;ions of my in&s;ecurity, and my de&s;olate circum&s;tances, had &s;o di&s;ordered me, that I remember I rambled &s;trangely in that letter.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I thought it, on re-peru&s;al, a half-di&s;tracted one: But I then de&s;paired (were I to begin again) of write|ing better: So I let it go: And can have no excu&s;e for directing it as I did, if the cau&s;e of the incoherence in it will not furni&s;h me with a very pitiable one.</P>
<P>The letter I received from your mother was a dread|ful blow to me. But neverthele&s;s, it had the good effect upon me (labouring, as I was ju&s;t then, under a violent
<PB N="76" REF="77">
&s;it of vapouri&s;h de&s;pondency, and almo&s;t yielding to it) which profu&s;e bleeding and bli&s;terings have in paraly|tical or apoplectical &s;trokes; reviving my attention, and re&s;toring me to &s;pirits to combat the evils I was &s;urround|ed by&mdash;Sluicing off, and diverting into a new chanel (if I may be allowed another metaphor), the overcharging woes, which threatened once more to overwhelm my in|tellects.</P>
<P>But yet, I mo&s;t &s;incerely lamented (and &s;till lament), in your mamma's words, <HI>That I cannot be unhappy by my&s;elf:</HI> And was grieved, not only for the trouble I had given you before; but for the new one I had brought upon you by my inattention.</P>
<Q>She then gives the contents of the letters &s;he wrote to Mrs. Norton, to Lady Betty Lawrence, and to Mrs. Hodges; as al&s;o of their an&s;wers; whereby &s;he detected all Mr. Lovelace's impo&s;tures.</Q>
<P>I cannot, however, &s;ays &s;he, forbear to wonder how the vile Tomlin&s;on could come at the knowlege of &s;eve|ral of the things he told me of, and which contributed to give me confidence in him <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">The attentive reader need not be referred back for what th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> lady neverthele&s;s could not account for, as &s;he knew not that Mr. Love|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ace had come at Mi&s;s Howe's letters; particularly that in vol. iv. p. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> which he comments upon p. 131.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I doubt not, continues &s;he, that the &s;tories of Mrs. Fretch|ville, and her hou&s;e, would be found as vile impo&s;tures as any of the re&s;t, were I to inquire; and had I not enough, and too much, already again&s;t the perjured man.</P>
<P>How have I been led on! &s;ays &s;he&mdash;What will be the end of &s;uch a fal&s;e and perjured creature; Heaven not le&s;s profaned and defied by him, than my&s;elf deceived and abu&s;ed! This, however, again&s;t my&s;elf I mu&s;t &s;ay, That if what I have &s;uffered is the natural con&s;equence of my fir&s;t error, I never can forgive <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> although you are &s;o partial in my favour, as to &s;ay, that I was not cen&s;urable for what pa&s;&s;ed before my fir&s;t e&s;cape.</P>
<P>And now, honoured Madam, and my deare&s;t Mi&s;s Howe, who are to &s;it in judgment upon my ca&s;e, permit me to lay down my pen, with one reque&s;t, which, with the greate&s;t earne&s;tne&s;s, I make to you both: And that

<P>MAY heaven &s;ignalize its vengeance, in the face of all the world, upon the mo&s;t abandoned and profligate of men!&mdash;And in its own time, I doubt not but it will.&mdash;And we mu&s;t look to a WORLD BEYOND THIS, for the reward of your &s;ufferings!&mdash;</P>
<P>Another &s;hocking detection, my dear!&mdash;How have you been deluded!&mdash;Very watchful I have thought you; very &s;agacious:&mdash;But, alas! not watchful, not &s;agacious enough, for the horrid villain you have had to deal with!&mdash;</P>
<P>The letter you &s;ent me inclo&s;ed as mine, of the 7th of June, is a villainous forgery <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Vol. <HI>V.</HI> p. <HI>94,</HI> &amp; &s;eq.</NOTE>. The hand, indeed, is a&s;toni&s;hingly like mine; and the cover, I &s;ee, is actually my cover: But yet the letter is not &s;o exactly imitated, but that (had you had any &s;u&s;picions about his vilene&s;s at the time) you, who &s;o well know my hand, might have detected it.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="79">In &s;hort, this vile forged letter, tho' a long one, con|tains but a few extracts from mine. Mine was a <HI>very</HI> long one. He has omitted every thing, I &s;ee, in it, that could have &s;hewn you what a dete&s;table hou&s;e the hou&s;e is; and given you &s;u&s;picions of the vile Tomlin&s;on.&mdash;You will &s;ee this, and how he has turned Mi&s;s Lardner's informa|tion, and my advices to you [execrable villain!] to his own horrid ends, by the rought draught of the genuine letter, which I &s;hall inclo&s;e <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. <HI>IV.</HI> p. <HI>328.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Apprehen&s;ive for <HI>both</HI> our &s;afeties, from &s;uch a daring and profligate contriver, I mu&s;t call upon you, my dear, to re&s;olve upon taking legal vengeance of the infernal wretch. And this not only for our own &s;akes, but for the &s;akes of innocents, who otherwi&s;e may yet be de|luded and outraged by him.</P>
<Q>She then gives the particulars of the report made by the young fellow whom &s;he &s;ent to Ham&s;tead with her letter; and who &s;uppo&s;ed he had delivered it into her own hand <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Vol. <HI>V.</HI> p. <HI>178.</HI></NOTE>; and then proceeds:</Q>
<P>I am a&s;toni&s;hed, that the vile wretch, who could know nothing of the time my me&s;&s;enger (who&s;e hone&s;ty I can vouch for) would come, could have a creature ready to per&s;onate you! Strange, that the man &s;hould happen to arrive ju&s;t as you were gone to church, as I find was the fact, on comparing what he &s;ays, with your hint that you were at church twice that day; when he might have got to Mrs. Moore's two hours before! &mdash; But had you told me, my dear, that the villain had found you out, and was about you!&mdash;You &s;hould have done that&mdash;Yet I blame you upon a judgment founded on the <HI>event</HI> only!</P>
<P>I never had any faith in the &s;tories that go current among country girls, of &s;pectres, familiars, and demons; yet I &s;ee not any other way to account for this wretch's &s;ucce&s;sful villainy, and for his means of working-up his &s;pecious delu&s;ions, but by &s;uppo&s;ing (if he be not the devil him&s;elf), that he has a familiar con&s;tantly at his elbow. Sometimes it &s;eems to me, that this familiar a&s;&s;umes the &s;hape of that &s;olemn villain Tomlin&s;on:
<PB N="79" REF="80">
Sometimes that of the execrable Sinclair, as he calls her: Sometimes it is permitted to take that of Lady Betty Lawrence&mdash;But, when it would a&s;&s;ume the angelic &s;hape and mien of my beloved friend, &s;ee what a bloated figure it made!</P>
<P>'Tis my opinion, my dear, that you will be no longer &s;afe where you are, than while the V. is in the country. Words are poor!&mdash;or how could I execrate him! I have hardly any doubt, that he has &s;old him&s;elf for a time. O may the time be &s;hort!&mdash;Or may his infernal prompter no more keep covenant with him, than he does with others!</P>
<P>I inclo&s;e not only the rough draught of my long letter mentioned above; but the heads of that which the young fellow thought he delivered into your own hands at Ham|&s;tead. And, when you have peru&s;ed them, I will leave you to judge, how much rea&s;on I had to be &s;urpri&s;ed, that you wrote me not an an&s;wer to either of tho&s;e lettes; one of which you owned you had received (tho' it proved to be is forged one); the other delivered into your own hands, as I was a&s;&s;ured; and both of them of &s;o much concern to your honour; and &s;till how much more &s;ur|pri&s;ed I mu&s;t be, when I received a letter from Mrs. Town&s;end, dated June 15. from Ham&s;tead, importing,
<Q>That Mr. Lovelace, who had been with you &s;everal days, had, on the Monday before, brought his aunt and cou&s;in, richly dre&s;&s;ed, and in a coach and four, to vi&s;it you: Who, with your own con&s;ent, had carried you to town with them&mdash;to your former lodgings; where you &s;till were: That the Ham&s;tead women be|lieved you to be married; and reflected upon me as a fomenter of differences between man and wife: That he him&s;elf was at Ham&s;tead the day before; viz. Wedn. the 14th; and boa&s;ted of his happine&s;s with you; in|viting Mrs. Moore, Mrs. Bevis, and Mi&s;s Rawlins, to go to town, to vi&s;it his &s;pou&s;e; which they promi&s;ed to do: That he declared, that you were intirely recon|ciled to your former lodgings:&mdash;And that, finally, the women at Ham&s;tead told Mrs. Town&s;end, that he had very hand&s;omely di&s;charged theirs.</Q></P>
<P>I own to you, my dear, that I was &s;o much &s;urpri&s;ed
<PB N="80" REF="81">
and di&s;gu&s;ted at the&s;e appearances, again&s;t a conduct till then unexceptionable, that I was re&s;olved to make my&s;elf as ea&s;y as I could, and wait till you &s;hould think fit to write to me. But I could rein-in my impatience but for a few days; and on the 20th of June I wrote a &s;harp letter to you; which I find you did not receive.</P>
<P>What a fatality, my dear, has appeared in your ca&s;e, from the very beginning till this hour! Had my mother permitted&mdash;</P>
<P>But can I blame <HI>her;</HI> when you have a <HI>father</HI> and <HI>mother</HI> living, who have &s;o much to an&s;wer for?&mdash;So much!&mdash; as no father and mother, con&s;idering the child they have driven, per&s;ecuted, expo&s;ed, renounced&mdash;ever had to an|&s;wer for!&mdash;</P>
<P>But again I mu&s;t execrate the abandoned villain&mdash;Yet, as I &s;aid before, <HI>all</HI> words are poor, and beneath the oc|ca&s;ion!</P>
<P>But &s;ee we not, in the horrid perjuries and treachery of this man, what rakes and libertines will do, when they get a young creature into their power? It is pro|bable, that he might have the intolerable pre&s;umption to hope an ea&s;ier conque&s;t: But, when your unexampled vigilance and exalted virtue made potions, and rapes, and the utmo&s;t violences, nece&s;&s;ary to the attainment of his dete&s;table end, we &s;ee that he never boggled at them. I have no doubt, that the &s;ame or equal wickedne&s;s would be <HI>oftener</HI> committed by men of this villainous ca&s;t, if the folly and credulity of the poor incon&s;iderates who throw them&s;elves into their hands, did not give them an ea&s;ier triumph.</P>
<P>With what comfort mu&s;t tho&s;e parents reflect upon the&s;e things, who have happily di&s;po&s;ed of their daugh|ters in marriage to a virtuous man! And how happy the young women, who find them&s;elves &s;afe in a worthy protection!&mdash;If &s;uch a per&s;on, as Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe could not e&s;cape, who can be &s;ecure?&mdash;Since, tho' every rake is not a LOVELACE, neither is every woman a CLARISSA: And his attempts were but proportioned to your re&s;i&s;tance and vigilance.</P>
<P>My mother has commanded me to let you know her thoughts upon the whole of your &s;ad &s;tory. I will do
<PB N="81" REF="82">
it in another letter; and &s;end it to you with this, by a &s;pecial me&s;&s;enger.</P>
<P>But, for the future, if you approve of it, I will &s;end my letters by the u&s;ual hand (Collins's) to be left at the Saracen's head on Snow-hill: Whither you may &s;end yours (as we both u&s;ed to do, to Wil&s;on's), except &s;uch as we &s;hall think fit to tran&s;mit by the po&s;t: Which I am afraid, after my next, mu&s;t be directed to Mr. Hickman, as before: Since my mother is for fixing a condition to our corre&s;pondence, which, I doubt, you will not com|ply with, tho' I wi&s;h you would. This condition I &s;hall acquaint you with by-and-by.</P>

<P>I NOW, my deare&s;t friend, re&s;ume my pen, to obey my mother, in giving you her opinion upon your unhappy &s;tory.</P>
<P>She &s;till harps upon the old &s;tring, and will have it, that all your calamities are owing to your fir&s;t fatal &s;tep; for &s;he believes (what I cannot), that your relations had intended, after one general trial more, to comply with your aver&s;ion, if they had found it as rivetted a one, as, let me &s;ay, it was a folly to &s;uppo&s;e it would not be found to be, after &s;o many <HI>ridiculou&s;ly</HI> repeated experiments.</P>
<P>As to your latter &s;ufferings from that vile&s;t of mi&s;|creants, &s;he is unalterably of opinion, that if all be as you have related (which &s;he doubts not), with regard to the potions, and to the violences you have &s;u&s;tained, you ought, by all means, to &s;et on foot a pro&s;ecution again&s;t him, and his devili&s;h accomplices.</P>
<P>She a&s;ks, What murderers, what ravi&s;hers, would be
<PB N="82" REF="83">
brought to ju&s;tice, if <HI>mode&s;ty</HI> were to be a general plea, and allowable, again&s;t appearing in a court to pro&s;ecute?</P>
<P>She &s;ays, that the good of &s;ociety requires, that &s;uch a bea&s;t of prey &s;hould be hunted out of it: And, if you do not pro&s;ecute him, &s;he thinks you will be an&s;werable for all the mi&s;chiefs he may do in the cour&s;e of his future villainous life.</P>
<P>Will it be thought, Nancy, &s;aid &s;he, that Mi&s;s Harlowe can be in earne&s;t, when &s;he &s;ays, &s;he is not &s;olicitous to have her di&s;graces concealed from the world, if &s;he is afraid or a&s;hamed to appear in court, to do ju&s;tice to her&s;elf and her &s;ex again&s;t him? Will it not be rather &s;urmi&s;ed, that &s;he may be apprehen&s;ive, that &s;ome weak|ne&s;s, or lurking love, will appear upon the trial of the &s;trange cau&s;e? If, inferred &s;he, &s;uch complicated villainy as this (where perjury, potions, forgery, &s;ubornation, are all combined to effect the ruin of an innocent crea|ture, and to di&s;honour a family of eminence, and where tho&s;e very crimes, as may be &s;uppo&s;ed, are proofs of her innocence) is to go off impunely, what ca&s;e will de&s;erve to be brought into judgment; or what malefactor ought to be hanged?</P>
<P>Then &s;he thinks, and &s;o do I, that the vile creatures, his accomplices, ought by all means to be brought to condign puni&s;hment, as they mu&s;t and will be, upon bring|ing him to his tryal: And this may be a means to blow up and root out a whole ne&s;t of vipers, and &s;ave many innocent creatures.</P>
<P>She added, That, if Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe could be &s;o indifferent about having this public ju&s;tice done upon &s;uch a wretch, for her <HI>own</HI> &s;ake, &s;he ought to overcome her &s;cruples out of regard to her family, her acquaintance, and her &s;ex, which are all highly injured and &s;candalized by his villainy to her.</P>
<P>For her own part, &s;he declares, That were <HI>&s;he</HI> your mother, &s;he would forgive you upon no other terms: And, upon your compliance with the&s;e, &s;he her&s;elf will undertake to reconcile all your family to you.</P>
<P>The&s;e, my dear, are my mother's &s;entiments upon your &s;ad &s;tory.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="84">I cannot &s;ay, but there are rea&s;on and ju&s;tice in them: And it is my opinion, that it would be very right for the Law to <HI>oblige</HI> an injured woman to pro&s;ecute, and to make &s;eduction on the man's part capital, where his &s;tudied ba&s;ene&s;s, and no fault in her will, appeared.</P>
<P>To this purpo&s;e, the cu&s;tom in the I&s;le of Man is a very good one&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>If a &s;ingle woman there pro&s;ecutes a &s;ingle man for a rape, the eccle&s;ia&s;tical judges impanel a jury; and, if this jury finds him guilty, he is returned <HI>guilty</HI> to the temporal courts: Where, if he be convicted, the deem&s;ter, or judge, delivers to the woman a Rope, a Sword, and a Ring; and &s;he has it in her choice to have him hanged, beheaded, or to marry him.</Q></P>
<P>One of the two former, I think, &s;hould always be her option.</P>
<P>I long for the full particulars of your &s;tory. You mu&s;t have but too much time upon your hands, for a mind &s;o active as yours, if tolerable health and &s;pirits be afforded you</P>
<P>The villainy of the wor&s;t of men, and the virtue of the mo&s;t excellent of women, I expect will be exemplified in it, were it to be written in the &s;ame connected and particular manner, that you u&s;ed to write to me in.</P>
<P>Try for it, my deare&s;t friend; and &s;ince you cannot give the <HI>example</HI> without the <HI>warning,</HI> give <HI>both,</HI> for the &s;akes of all tho&s;e who &s;hall hear of your unhappy fate; beginning from yours of June 5. your pro&s;pects then not di&s;agreeable. I pity you for the ta&s;k; tho' I cannot willingly exempt you from it.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<P>MY mother will have me add, That &s;he mu&s;t <HI>in&s;i&s;t</HI> upon your pro&s;ecuting.

<P><PB N="84" REF="85">Once more your thoughts of it, &s;uppo&s;ing it were to meet with the approbation of your relations.</P>
<P>But whatever be your determination on this head, it &s;hall be my con&s;tant prayer, That God will give you patience to bear your heavy afflictions, as a per&s;on ought to do, who&s;e faulty will has not brought them upon her&s;elf; that He will &s;peak peace and comfort to your wounded mind; and give you many happy years.</P>

Whither can I fly?&mdash;Perhaps my bad &s;tate of health (which mu&s;t grow wor&s;e, as recollection of the pa&s;t evils, and re|flections upon them, grow heavier and heavier upon me) may be my protection. Once, indeed, I thought of going abroad; and had I the pro&s;pect of many years before me, I would go.&mdash;But, my dear, the blow is given.&mdash; Nor have you rea&s;on, now, circum&s;tanced as I am, to be concerned, that it is. What a heart mu&s;t I have, if it be not broken!&mdash;And, indeed, my <HI>dear,</HI> my <HI>be&s;t,</HI> I had almo&s;t &s;aid my <HI>only</HI> friend, I do &s;o earne&s;tly wi&s;h for the la&s;t clo&s;ing &s;cene, and with &s;o much comfort find my&s;elf in a declining way, that I even &s;ometimes ingratefully regret that naturally healthy con&s;titution, which u&s;ed to double upon me all my enjoyments.</P>
<P>As to the earne&s;tly recommended pro&s;ecution, I may po&s;&s;ibly touch upon it more largely hereafter, if ever I &s;hall have better &s;pirits; for they are at pre&s;ent extremely &s;unk and low.&mdash;But, ju&s;t now, will only &s;ay, that I would &s;ooner &s;uffer every evil (the repetition of the capital one excepted), than appear publicly in a court to do my&s;elf ju&s;tice <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Dr. Lewin, as will be &s;een hereafter, pre&s;&s;es her to this public pro&s;ecution, by arguments worthy of his character: Which &s;he an&s;wers in a manner worthy of hers.</NOTE>. And I am heartily grieved, that your mother pre&s;cribes &s;uch a mea&s;ure, as the condition of our future corre&s;pondence.&mdash;For, the continuance of your friend|&s;hip, my dear, and the de&s;ire I had to corre&s;pond with you to my life's end, were all my remaining hopes and

con&s;olation. Neverthele&s;s, as that friend&s;hip is in the power of the <HI>heart,</HI> not of the <HI>hand</HI> only, I hope I &s;hall not forfeit that.</P>
<P>O my dear! what weight has a parent's cur&s;e&mdash;You cannot imagine&mdash;But I will not touch this &s;tring to you, who never loved them!&mdash;A reconciliation with them is not be hoped for!</P>
<P>I have written a letter to Mi&s;s Rawlins of Ham&s;tead; the an&s;wer to which, ju&s;t now received, has helped me to the knowledge of the vile contrivance, by which this wicked man got your letter of June the 10th. I will give you the contents of both.</P>
<P>In mine to her, I briefly acquaint her <Q>with what had befallen me, thro' the vilene&s;s of the women who had been pa&s;&s;ed upon me, as the aunt and cou&s;in of the wickede&s;t of men; and own, that I never was married to him. I de&s;ire her to make particular in|quiry, and to let me know, who it was at Mrs. Moore's, that on Sunday afternoon, June 11. while I was at church, received a letter from Mi&s;s Howe, pretending to be me, and lying on a couch:&mdash;Which letter, had it come to my hands, would have &s;aved me from ruin. I excu&s;e my&s;elf (from the delirium, which the bar|barous u&s;age I had received, threw me into, and from a confinement as barbarous and illegal), that I had not before applied to Mrs. Moore, for an account of what I was indebted to her: Which I now de&s;ired. And for &s;ear of being traced by Mr. Lovelace, I directed her to &s;uper&s;cribe her an&s;wer, To Mrs. Mary Atkins&punc; to be left till called for, at the Bell-Savage Inn, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Ludgate-Hill.</Q></P>

<P>I WRITE, my deare&s;t creature, I cannot <HI>but</HI> write, to expre&s;s my concern on your dejection. Let me be&s;eech you, my charming excellence, let me be&s;eech you, not to give way to it.</P>
<P>Comfort your&s;elf, on the contrary, in the triumphs of a virtue un&s;ullied; a will wholly faultle&s;s. Who could have with&s;tood the trials that you have &s;urmounted?&mdash;Your cou&s;in Morden will &s;oon come.

On this over-&s;olicitude, it is now plain to me, that the vile&s;t of men, built all his &s;chemes. He &s;aw you had a thir&s;t after it, beyond all rea&s;on for hope.

<P>I AM extremely concerned, my dear Mi&s;s Howe, for being primarily the occa&s;ion of the apprehen&s;ions you have of this wicked man's vindictive attempts. What a wide &s;preading error is mine!&mdash;</P>
<P>If I find, that he &s;ets on foot any machination again&s;t you, or Mr. Hickman, I do a&s;&s;ure you I will con&s;ent to pro&s;ecute him, altho' I were &s;ure I &s;hould not &s;urvive my fir&s;t appearance at the Bar he &s;hould be arraigned at.</P>
<P>I own the ju&s;tice of your mother's arguments on that &s;ubject; but mu&s;t &s;ay, that I think there are circum&s;tances in my particular ca&s;e, which will excu&s;e me, altho' (on a &s;lighter occa&s;ion than <HI>that</HI> above apprehended) I &s;hould decline to appear again&s;t him. I have &s;aid, that I may one day enter more particularly into this &s;ubject.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="91">Your me&s;&s;enger has now indeed &s;een me. I talked with him on the impo&s;ture put upon him at Ham&s;tead: And am &s;orry to have rea&s;on to &s;ay, that had not the poor young man been very <HI>&s;imple,</HI> and very <HI>&s;elf-&s;ufficient,</HI> he had not been &s;o gro&s;ly deluded. Mrs. Bevis has the &s;ame plea to make for her&s;elf. A good-natured, thought|le&s;s woman; not u&s;ed to conver&s;e with &s;o vile and &s;o &s;pecious a deceiver, as him, who made his advantage of both the&s;e &s;hallow creatures.</P>
<P>I think I cannot be more private, than where I am. I hope I am &s;afe. All the ri&s;que I run, is in going out, and returning from morning prayers; which I have two or three times ventured to do; once at Lincolns-Inn chapel, at eleven; once at St. Dun&s;tan's Fleet-&s;treet, at &s;even in the morning, in a chair both times; and twice at &s;ix in the morning, at the neighbouring church in Covent-garden. The wicked wretches I have e&s;caped from, will not, I hope, come to church to look for me; e&s;pecially at &s;o early prayers; and I have fixed upon the private&s;t pew in the latter church to hide my&s;elf in; and perhaps I may lay out a little matter in an ordinary gown, by way of di&s;gui&s;e; my face half hid by my mob.&mdash;I am very carele&s;s, my dear, of my appearance now. Neat and clean, takes up the whole of my at|tention.</P>
<P>The man's name, at who&s;e hou&s;e I lodge, is Smith&mdash; A glove-<HI>maker,</HI> as well as <HI>&s;eller.</HI> His wife is the &s;hop-keeper. A dealer al&s;o in &s;tockens, ribbands, &s;nuff, and perfumes. A matron-like woman, plain-hearted, and prudent. The hu&s;band an hone&s;t, indu&s;trious man. And they live in good under&s;tanding with each other. A proof with me, that their hearts are right; for where a married couple live together upon ill terms, it is a &s;ign, I think, that each knows &s;omething ami&s;s of the other, either with regard to temper or morals, which if the world knew as well as them&s;elves, it would as little like them, as &s;uch people like each other. Happy the marriage, where neither man nor wife has any wilful or premedi|tated evil in their general conduct to reproach the other with!&mdash;For even per&s;ons who have bad hearts, will have a veneration for tho&s;e who have good ones.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="92">Two neat rooms, with plain but clean furniture, on the fir&s;t floor, are mine; one they call the dining-room.</P>
<P>There is, up another pair of &s;tairs, a very worthy widow-lodger, Mrs. Lovick by name; who, altho' of low fortunes, is much re&s;pected, as Mrs. Smith a&s;&s;ures me, by people of condition of her acquaintance for her piety, prudence, and under&s;tanding. With her I propo&s;e to be well acquainted.</P>
<P>I thank you, my dear, for your kind, you &s;ea&s;onable advice and con&s;olation. I hope I &s;hall have more grace given me, than to de&s;pond, in the <HI>religious</HI> &s;en&s;e of the word: E&s;pecially, as I can apply to my&s;elf the comfort you give me, that neither my will, nor my incon&s;ider|atene&s;s, has contributed to my calamity. But never|thele&s;s, the irreconcileablene&s;s of my relations, whom I love with an unabated reverence; my apprehen&s;ions of fre&s;h violences (This wicked man, I doubt, will not yet let me re&s;t); my de&s;titutene&s;s of protection; my youth, my &s;ex, my unacquaintedne&s;s with the world, &s;ubjecting me to in&s;ults; my reflections on the &s;candal I have given, added to the &s;en&s;e of the indignities I have received from a man, of whom I de&s;erved not ill; all together will undoubtedly bring on the effect, that cannot be un|de&s;irable to me:&mdash;The &s;lower, however, perhaps from my natural good ocn&s;titution; and, as I pre&s;ume to ima|gine, from principles which I hope will, in due time, and by due reflection, &s;et me <HI>above the &s;en&s;e of all worldly di&s;appointments.</HI></P>
<P>At pre&s;ent, my head is much di&s;ordered. I have not indeed enjoyed it with any degree of clearne&s;s, &s;ince the violence done to that, and to my heart too, by the wicked arts of the abandoned creatures I was ca&s;t among.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t have more conflicts. At times I find my &s;elf not &s;ubdued enough to my condition. I will welcome tho&s;e conflicts as they come, as <HI>probationary</HI> ones&mdash;But yet my father's malediction&mdash;Yet I hope even that may be made of &s;o much u&s;e to me, as to cau&s;e me to <HI>double my attention to render it ineffectual.</HI></P>
<P>All I will at pre&s;ent add, are my thanks to your mo|ther for her indulgence to us. Due compliments to Mr. Hickman; and my reque&s;t, that you will believe me to

<P>I HAVE three of thy letters at once before me to an&s;wer; in each of which thou complaine&s;t of my &s;ilence; and in one of them telle&s;t me, that thou can&s;t not live unle&s;s I &s;cribble to thee every day, or every other day at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>Why, then, die, Jack, if thou wilt. &mdash; What heart, thinke&s;t thou, can I have to write, when I have lo&s;t the only &s;ubject worth writing upon?</P>
<P>Help me again to my Angel, to my CLARISSA; and thou &s;halt have a letter from me, or writing at lea&s;t, part of a letter, every hour. All that the charmer of my heart &s;hall &s;ay, that will I put down: Every motion, every air of her beloved per&s;on, every look, will I try to de|&s;cribe; and when &s;he is &s;ilent, I will endeavour to tell thee her thoughts, either what they are, or what I'd have them to be&mdash;So that, having <HI>her,</HI> I &s;hall never want a &s;ubject. Having lo&s;t her, my whole &s;oul is a blank: The whole creation round me, the elements above, beneath, and every thing I <HI>behold</HI> (for nothing can I <HI>enjoy</HI>) is a blank without her!</P>
<P>O Return, Return, thou dear charmer of my &s;oul! Return to thy adoring Lovelace! What is the light, what the air, what the town, what the country, what's any-thing, without thee? Light, air, joy, harmony, in my notion, are but parts of thee; and could they be all ex|pre&s;&s;ed in one word, that word would be CLARISSA.</P>
<P>O my beloved CLARISSA, Return thou then; once more Return to ble&s;s thy LOVELACE, who now, by the lo&s;s of thee, knows the value of the jewel he has &s;lighted;

and ri&s;es every morning but to cur&s;e the &s;un, that &s;hines upon every-body but him!</P>
<P>WELL but, Jack, 'tis a &s;urpri&s;ing thing to me, that the dear fugitive cannot be met with; cannot be heard of. She is &s;o poor a plotter (for plotting is not her talent), that I am confident, had I been at liberty, I &s;hould have found her out before now; altho' the different emi&s;&s;aries I have employed about town, round the adjacent villages, and in Mi&s;s Howe's vicinage, have hitherto failed of &s;ucce&s;s. But my Lord continues &s;o weak and low-&s;pirited, that there is no getting from him. I would not di&s;oblige a man whom I think in danger &s;till: For would his gout, now it has got him down, but give him, like a fair boxer, the ri&s;ing-blow, all would be over with him. And here (pox of his fondne&s;s for me! it happens at a very bad time) he makes me &s;it hours together entertaining him with my rog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eries (a pretty amu&s;ement for a &s;ick man!): And yet, whenever he has the gout, he prays night and morning with his chaplain. But what mu&s;t <HI>his</HI> notions of religion be, who, after he has no&s;ed and mumbled over his re&s;pon&s;es, can give a &s;igh or groan of &s;atisfaction, as if he thought he had made up with heaven; and return with a new appetite to my &s;tories?&mdash;Encouraging them, by &s;haking his &s;ides with laughing at them, and calling me a &s;ad fellow in &s;uch an accent, as &s;hews he takes no &s;mall delight in his kin&s;man.</P>
<P>The old Peer has been a &s;inner in his day, and &s;uffers for it now: A &s;neaking &s;inner, <HI>&s;liding,</HI> rather than <HI>ru&s;h|ing,</HI> into vices, for fear of his reputation: Or, rather, for fear of detection, and po&s;itive proof; for the&s;e &s;ort of fellows, Jack, have no real regard for reputation.&mdash; Paying for what he never had, and never daring to ri&s;e to the joy of an enterprize at fir&s;t hand, which could bring him within view of a tilting, or of the honour of being con&s;idered as the principal man in a court of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>To &s;ee &s;uch an old Trojan as this, ju&s;t dropping into the grave, which I hoped ere this would have been dug, and filled up with him; crying out with pain, and grunt|ing with weakne&s;s; yet in the &s;ame moment crack his
<PB N="94" REF="95">
leathern face into an horrible laugh, and call a young &s;inner charming varlet, encoreing him, as formerly he u&s;ed to do the Italian eunuchs; what a prepo&s;terous, what an unnatural adherence to old habits!</P>
<P>My two cou&s;ins are generally pre&s;ent when I <HI>entertain,</HI> as the old peer calls it. Tho&s;e &s;tories mu&s;t drag horribly, that have not more hearers and applauders, than relaters.</P>
<P><HI>Applauders!&mdash;</HI></P>
<P>Ay, Belford, <HI>Applauders,</HI> repeat I; for altho' the&s;e girls pretend to blame me &s;ometimes for the <HI>facts,</HI> they prai&s;e my manner, my invention, my intrepidity.&mdash;Be|&s;ides, what other people call <HI>blame,</HI> that call I <HI>prai&s;e:</HI> I ever did; and &s;o I very early di&s;charged <HI>&s;hame,</HI> that cold|water damper to an enterpri&s;ing &s;pirit.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;mart girls; they have life and wit; and ye&s;terday, upon Charlotte's raving again&s;t me upon a related enterprize, I told her, that I had had it in debate &s;everal times, whether &s;he were or were not too near of kin to me: And that it was once a moot point with me, whether I could not love her dearly for a month&punc; or &s;o: And perhaps it was well for her, that another pretty little pu&s;s &s;tarted up, and diverted me, ju&s;t as I was entering upon the cour&s;e.</P>
<P>They all three held up their hands and eyes at once. But I ob&s;erved, that tho' the girls exclaimed again&s;t me, they were not &s;o angry at this plain &s;peaking, as I have found my beloved upon hints &s;o dark, that I have won|dered at her quick apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>I told Charlotte, That, grave as &s;he pretended to be in her <HI>&s;miling</HI> re&s;entments on this declaration, I was &s;ure I &s;hould not have been put to the expence of above two or three &s;tratagems (for nobody admired a good inven|tion more than &s;he), could I but have di&s;entangled her con&s;cience from the embara&s;&s;es of con&s;anguinity.</P>
<P>She pretended to be highly di&s;plea&s;ed: So did her &s;i&s;ter for her: I told her, that &s;he &s;eemed as much in earne&s;t, as if &s;he had thought <HI>me</HI> &s;o; and <HI>dared</HI> the trial. Plain words, I &s;aid, in the&s;e ca&s;es, were more &s;hocking to their &s;ex than gradatim actions. And I bid Patty not be di&s;plea&s;ed at my di&s;tingui&s;hing her &s;i&s;ter; &s;ince I had a great re&s;pect for <HI>her</HI> likewi&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIX. <HI>Mr.</HI> LOVELACE, <HI>To</HI> JOHN BELFORD, <ABBR><HI>E&s;q</HI></ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Six Sat. morning, July</HI> 8.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>HAVE I nothing new, nothing diverting, in my whim&s;ical way, thou a&s;ke&s;t, in one of thy three letters before me, to entertain thee with?&mdash;And thou telle&s;t me, that, when I have lea&s;t to <HI>narrate,</HI> to &s;peak in the Scoti&s;h phra&s;e, I am mo&s;t diverting. A pretty compli|ment, either to thy&s;elf, or to me. To both indeed!&mdash;A &s;ign that thou ha&s;t as frothy a heart as I a head. But can&s;t thou &s;uppo&s;e, that this admirable woman is not All, is not Every-thing, with me? Yet I dread to think of her too; for detection of all my contrivances, I doubt, mu&s;t come next.</P>
<P>The old Peer is al&s;o full of Mi&s;s Harlowe; and &s;o are my cou&s;ins. He hopes I will not be &s;uch a dog [There's a &s;pecimen of his peer-like dialect], as to think of doing di&s;honourably by a woman of &s;o much merit, beauty, and fortune; and, he &s;ays, of &s;o good a family. But I tell him, that this is a &s;tring he mu&s;t not touch: That it is a very tender point: In &s;hort, is my &s;ore place; and that I am afraid he would handle it too roughly, were I to put my&s;elf into the power of &s;o ungentle an operator.</P>
<P>He &s;hakes his crazy head. He thinks all is not as it &s;hould be between us; longs to have me pre&s;ent her to him, as my wife; and often tells me what great things he will do, additional to his former propo&s;als; and what pre&s;ents he will make on the birth of the fir&s;t child.
<PB N="96" REF="97">
But I hope the whole will be in my hands before &s;uch an event take place. No harm in <HI>hoping,</HI> Jack! My uncle &s;ays, <HI>Were it not for hope, the heart would break.</HI></P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<P>EIGHT o'clock at Mid-&s;ummer, and the&s;e lazy varlete&s;&s;es (in full health) not come down yet to breakfa&s;t!&mdash;What a confounded indecency in young Ladies, to let a Rake know that they love their beds &s;o dearly, and, at the &s;ame time, <HI>where to have them!</HI> But I'll puni&s;h them: They &s;hall breakfa&s;t with their old uncle, and yawn at one an|other, as if for a wager: While I drive my Phaeton to Col. Ambro&s;e's, who ye&s;terday gave me invitation both to breakfa&s;t and dine, on account of two York&s;hire nieces, celebrated toa&s;ts, who have been with him this fortnight pa&s;t; and who, he &s;ays, want to &s;ee <HI>me.</HI> So, Jack, all women do not run away from me, thank Hea|ven! &mdash;I wi&s;h I could have leave of my heart, &s;ince the dear fugitive is &s;o ingrateful, to drive her out of it with another Beauty. But who can &s;upplant her? Who can be admitted to a place in it, after Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe?</P>
<P>At my return, if I can find a &s;ubject, I will &s;cribble on, to oblige thee.</P>
<P>My Phaeton's ready: My cou&s;ins &s;end me word they are ju&s;t coming down: So in &s;pite I'll be gone.&mdash;</P>

<P>I DID &s;tay to dine with the Colonel, and his Lady and Nieces: But I could not pa&s;s the afternoon with them, for the heart of me. There was enough in the per&s;ons and faces of the two young ladies to &s;et me upon compari&s;ons. Particular features held my attention for a few moments: But tho&s;e &s;erved but to whet my impatience to find the charmer of my &s;oul; who, for per&s;on, for air, for mind, had never any equal. My heart recoil'd and &s;icken'd upon comparing minds and conver&s;ation. Pert wit, a too &s;tudied-for de&s;ire to plea&s;e; each in high good hu|mour with her&s;elf; an open-mouth affectation in both, to &s;hew white teeth, as if the principal excellence; and to invite amorous familiarity, by the promi&s;e of a &s;weet breath; at the &s;ame time reflecting tacitly upon breaths arrogantly implied to be le&s;s pure.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="98">Once I could have borne them.</P>
<P>They &s;eemed to be di&s;appointed, that I was &s;o &s;oon able to leave them. Yet have I not at pre&s;ent &s;o much vanity (My Clari&s;&s;a has cured me of my vanity!), as to at|tribute their di&s;appointment &s;o much to particular liking of me, as to their own &s;elf-admiration. They looked upon me, as a connoi&s;&s;eur in beauty. They would have been proud of engaging my attention, as &s;uch: But &s;o affected, &s;o flim&s;y-witted, mere &s;kin-deep beauties!&mdash; They had looked no further into them&s;elves than what their gla&s;&s;es had enabled them to &s;ee: And their gla&s;&s;es were flattering-gla&s;&s;es too; for I thought them pa&s;&s;ive-faced, and &s;piritle&s;s; with eyes, however, upon the hunt for conque&s;ts, and be&s;peaking the attention of others, in order to countenance their own.&mdash;I believe I could, with a little pains, have given them life and &s;oul, and to every feature of their faces &s;parkling information &mdash; But my Clari&s;&s;a!&mdash;O Belford, my Clari&s;&s;a has made me eyele&s;s and &s;en&s;ele&s;s to every other Beauty! &mdash; Do thou find her for me, as a &s;ubject worthy of my pen, or This &s;hall be the la&s;t from</P>

<P>NOW, Jack, have I a &s;ubject with a vengeance. I am in the very height of my tryal for all my &s;ins to my beloved fugitive. For here, ye&s;terday, at about five o'clock, arrived Lady Sarah Sadleir and Lady Betty Law|rance, each in her chariot and &s;ix. Dowagers love equi|page; and the&s;e cannot travel ten miles without a &s;et, and half a dozen hor&s;emen.</P>
<P>My time had hung heavy upon my hands; and &s;o I went to church after dinner. Why may not hand&s;ome fellows, thought I, like to be look'd at, as well as hand|&s;ome wenches?&mdash;I fell in, when Service was over, with Major Warneton; and &s;o came not home till after &s;ix; and was &s;urpri&s;ed, at entering the court-yard here, to find it litter'd with equipages and &s;ervants. I was &s;ure the owners of them came for no good to me.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="99">Lady Sarah, I &s;oon found, was rai&s;ed to this vi&s;it by Lady Betty; who has health enough to allow her to look out of her&s;elf, and out of her own affairs, for bu&s;ine&s;s. Yet congratulation to my uncle on his amendment (Spite|ful devils on both accounts!) was the avowed errand. But coming in my ab&s;ence, I was their principal &s;ubject: and they had opportunity to &s;et each other's heart again&s;t me.</P>
<P>Simon Par&s;ons hinted this to me, as I pa&s;&s;ed by the Steward's office; for it &s;eems they talked loud; and he was making up &s;ome accounts with old Pritchard.</P>
<P>However, I ha&s;ten'd to pay my duty to them. Other people not performing theirs, is not excu&s;e for the neglect of our own, you know.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>And now I enter upon my TRYAL.</HEAD>
<P>WITH horrible grave faces was I received. The two antiques only bowed their tabby heads; making longer faces than ordinary; and all the old lines appear|ing &s;trong in their furrow'd foreheads and fallen cheeks, How do you, cou&s;in? and, How do you, Mr. Lovelace? looking all round at one another, as who &s;hould &s;ay, Do you &s;peak fir&s;t; and, Do you: For they &s;eemed re&s;olved to lo&s;e no time.</P>
<P>I had nothing for it, but an air as manly, as theirs was womanly. Your &s;ervant, Madam, to Lady Betty; and Your &s;ervant, Madam&mdash;I am glad to &s;ee you abroad, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Lady Sarah.</P>
<P>I took my &s;eat. Lord M. look'd horribly glum, hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> fingers cla&s;ped, and turning round and round, under and over, his but ju&s;t di&s;gouted thumbs; his &s;allow face, and goggling eyes, ca&s;t upon the floor, on the fire-place, on hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> two &s;i&s;ters, on his two kin&s;women, by turns; but no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> once deigning to look upon me.</P>
<P>Then I began to think of the Laudanum and wet cloth I had told thee of long ago; and to call my&s;elf in que&s;tio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for a tenderne&s;s of heart that will never do me good.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, Mr. Lovelace;&mdash;Cou&s;in Lovelace!&mdash;Hem!&mdash; Hem!&mdash;I am &s;orry, very &s;orry, he&s;itated Lady Sara<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that thee is no hope of your ever taking up&mdash;</P>
<P>What's the matter <HI>now,</HI> Madam?</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="100">The matter now!&mdash;Why, Lady Betty has two letters from Mi&s;s Harlowe, which have <HI>told</HI> us what's the matter &mdash; Are all women alike with you?</P>
<P>Yes; I could have an&s;wered; 'bating the difference which pride makes.</P>
<P>Then they all chorus'd upon me&mdash;Such a character as Mi&s;s Harlowe's! cry'd one&mdash;A lady of &s;o much genero&s;ity and good &s;en&s;e! another&mdash;How charmingly &s;he writes! the two maiden monkies, looking at her fine hand-writing: Her perfections my crimes. What can you expect will be the end of the&s;e things? cried Lady Sarah &mdash; Damn'd, damn'd doings! vociferated the Peer, &s;haking his loo&s;e-fle&s;h'd wabbling chaps, which hung on his &s;houlders like an old cow's dew-lap.</P>
<P>For my part, I hardly knew whether to &s;ing or &s;ay, what I had to reply to the&s;e all-at-once attacks upon me! &mdash; Fair and &s;oftly, Ladies &mdash; One at a time, I be&s;eech you. I am not to be hunted down without being heard, I hope. Pray let me &s;ee the&s;e letters. I beg you will let me &s;ee them.</P>
<P>There they are:&mdash;That's the fir&s;t&mdash;Read it out, if you can.</P>
<P>I open'd a letter from my charmer, date <HI>Thur&s;day, June</HI> 29. our wedding-day, that was to be, and written to Lady Betty Lawrance.&mdash;By the contents, to my great joy, I find the dear creature is alive and well, and in charming &s;pirits. But the direction where to &s;end an an&s;wer was &s;o &s;cratched out, that I could not read it; which afflicted me much.</P>
<P>She puts three que&s;tions in it to Lady Betty.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t, About a letter of hers, date <HI>June</HI> 7. congratulating our nuptials, and which I was &s;o good as to &s;ave my aunt the trouble of writing: A very civil thing of me, I think.</P>
<P>Again&mdash;
<Q>Whether &s;he and one of her nieces Mon|tague were to go to town, on an old Chancery-&s;uit?</Q>
And,
<Q>Whether they actually did go to town accord|ingly, and to Ham&s;tead afterwards?</Q> and
<Q>Whether they brought to town from thence the young creature whom they vi&s;ited;</Q>
was the &s;ubject of the &s;econd and third que&s;tions.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="101">A little inqui&s;itive dear rogue! And what did &s;he ex|pect to be the better for the&s;e que&s;tions?&mdash;But curio&s;ity, damn'd curio&s;ity, is the itch of the Sex&mdash;Yet when did&s;t thou know it turn'd to their benefit?&mdash;For they &s;eldom in|quire, but when they fear&mdash;And the proverb, as my Lord has it, &s;ays <HI>It comes with a fear.</HI> That is, I &s;uppo&s;e, what they fear, generally happens, becau&s;e there is generally occa&s;ion for the fear.</P>
<P>Curio&s;ity indeed &s;he avows to be her only motive for the&s;e interrogatories: For tho' &s;he &s;ays, her Lady&s;hip may &s;uppo&s;e the que&s;tions are not a&s;ked for good to <HI>me,</HI> yet the an&s;wer can do me no harm, nor her good, only to give her to under&s;tand, whether I have told her&mdash;a parcel of damn'd lyes; that's the plain Engli&s;h of her inquiry.</P>
<P>Well, Madam, &s;aid I, with as much philo&s;ophy as I could a&s;&s;ume; and may I a&s;k, pray, What was your Lady&s;hip's an&s;wer?</P>
<P>There's a copy of it, to&s;&s;ing it to me, very di&s;re&s;pect|fully.</P>
<P>This an&s;wer was dated <HI>July</HI> 1. A very kind and complai&s;ant one to the lady, but very &s;o-&s;o to her poor kin&s;man. &mdash;That people can give up their own fle&s;h and blood with &s;o much ea&s;e!&mdash;She tells her
<Q>how proud all our family would be of an alliance with &s;uch an ex|cellence.</Q>
She does me ju&s;tice in &s;aying how much I adore her, as an angel of a lady; and begs of her for I know not how many &s;akes, be&s;ides my &s;oul's &s;ake
<Q>that &s;he will be &s;o good as to have me for an hu&s;band: And an&s;wers,&mdash;thou wilt gue&s;s how&mdash;to the lady's que|&s;tions.</Q></P>
<P>Well, Madam; and, pray, may I be favour'd with the lady's other letter? I pre&s;ume it is in reply to yours.</P>
<P>It is, &s;aid the Peer: But, Sir, let me a&s;k you a few que&s;tions, before you read it&mdash;Give <HI>me</HI> the letter, Lady Betty.</P>
<P>There it is, my Lord.</P>
<P>Then on went the &s;pectacles, and his head moved to the lines&mdash;A charming pretty hand!&mdash;I have often heard, that this lady is a <HI>genus.</HI></P>

&s;hall know, that in the progre&s;s to her ruin, wilful fal&s;hoods, repeated forgeries, and number|le&s;s perjuries, were not the lea&s;t of my crimes, you will judge that &s;he can have no principles that will make her worthy of an alliance with ladies of yours, and your noble &s;i&s;ters character, if &s;he could not, from her &s;oul, declare, that &s;uch an alliance can never now take place.</Q></P>
<P>Surely, Ladies, this is pa&s;&s;ion! This is not rea&s;on. If our family would not think them&s;elves di&s;honoured by my marrying a per&s;on whom I had &s;o treated; but, on the contrary, would rejoice that I did this ju&s;tice; and if &s;he has come out pure gold from the a&s;&s;ay; and has nothing to reproach her&s;elf with; why &s;hould it be an impeachment of her principles, to con&s;ent, that &s;uch an alliance &s;hould take place?</P>
<P>She cannot think her&s;elf the wor&s;e, <HI>ju&s;tly</HI> &s;he cannot, for what was done again&s;t her will.</P>
<P>Their countenances menaced a general uproar&mdash;But I proceeded.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip read to us, That &s;he had an <HI>hope,</HI> a <HI>pre|&s;umptuous</HI> one; nay, a <HI>puni&s;hably pre&s;umptuous</HI> one, &s;he calls it;
<Q>that &s;he might be a means in the hands of Providence, to reclaim me; and that this, &s;he knew, if effected, would give her a merit with you all.</Q>
But
<PB N="105" REF="106">
from <HI>what</HI> would &s;he reclaim me?&mdash;She had <HI>heard,</HI> you'll &s;ay (but &s;he had <HI>only</HI> heard, at the time &s;he held <HI>That Hope</HI>), that, to expre&s;s my&s;elf in the womens dialect, I was <HI>a very wicked fellow:</HI> &mdash;Well, and what then?&mdash; Why, truly, the very moment &s;he was <HI>convinced,</HI> by her own experience, that the charge again&s;t me was <HI>more</HI> than <HI>hear&s;ay;</HI> and that, of con&s;equence, I was a fit &s;ubject for her <HI>generous endeavours</HI> to work upon; &s;he would needs give me up. Accordingly, &s;he flies out, and declares, that the ceremony which would repair all, &s;hall never take place!&mdash; Can this be from any other motive, than <HI>female re&s;entment?</HI></P>
<P>This brought them all upon me, as I intended it &s;hould: It was as a tub to the whale; and after I had let them play with it awhile, I claimed their attention, and know|ing that they always loved to hear me prate, went on.</P>
<P>The lady, it is plain, thought, that the reclaiming of a man from bad habits, was a much <HI>ea&s;ier ta&s;k,</HI> than, in the <HI>nature of things,</HI> it <HI>can</HI> be.</P>
<P>She writes, as your Lord&s;hip has read,
<Q>That in endea|vouring to &s;ave a drowning wretch, &s;he had been, not ac|cidentally, but premeditatedly, and of &s;et purpo&s;e, drawn in after him</Q>
But how is this, Ladies?&mdash;You &s;ee by her own words, that I am &s;till far from being out of danger my&s;elf. Had &s;he found me, in a quagmire &s;uppo&s;e, and I had got out of it by her means, and left her to peri&s;h in it; that would have been a crime indeed. &mdash;But is not the fact quite otherwi&s;e? Has &s;he not, if her allegory proves what &s;he would have it prove, got out her&s;elf, and left me floundering &s;till deeper and deeper in?&mdash;What &s;he &s;hould have done, had &s;he been in earne&s;t to &s;ave me, was, to join her hand with mine, that &s;o we might by our united &s;trength help one another out.&mdash;I held out my hand to her, and be&s;ought her to give me hers:&mdash;But, no, truly! &s;he was determin'd to get out her&s;elf as fa&s;t as &s;he could, let me <HI>&s;ink or &s;wim:</HI> Refu&s;ing her a&s;&s;itance (again&s;t her own principles), becau&s;e &s;he &s;aw I wanted it.&mdash; You &s;ee, Ladies, you &s;ee, my Lord, how pretty tinkling words run away with ears inclined to be mu&s;ical!&mdash;</P>

Why now, cou&s;in Charlotte, chucking her under the chin, would you have me tell you all that has pa&s;&s;ed between the lady and me? Would Yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> care, had you a bold and enterpri&s;ing lover, that procla|mation &s;hould be made of every little piece of amorous roguery, that he offer'd to you?</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="108">Charlotte redden'd. They all began to exclaim. But I proceeded.</P>
<P>The lady &s;ays,
<Q>She has been di&s;honour'd (devil take me, if I &s;pare my&s;elf!) by means, that would &s;hock humanity to be made acquainted with them.</Q>
She is a very innocent lady, and may not be a <HI>judge</HI> of the means &s;he hints at. <HI>Over-nicene&s;s may be under-nicene&s;s:</HI> Have you not &s;uch a proverb, my Lord?&mdash;tantamount to, <HI>One extreme produces another!</HI>&mdash;Such a lady as This, may po&s;&s;ibly think her ca&s;e more extraordinary than it is. This I will take upon me to &s;ay, That if &s;he has met with the only man in the world, who would have treated her, as &s;he &s;ays I have treated her, I have met in her, with the <HI>only woman in the world,</HI> who would have made &s;uch a rout about a ca&s;e that is uncommon only from the cir|cum&s;tances that attend it.</P>
<P>This brought them all upon me, hands, eyes, voices, all lifted up at once. But my Lord M. who has in his <HI>head</HI> (the la&s;t &s;eat of retreating lewdne&s;s) as much wicked|ne&s;s as I have in my <HI>heart,</HI> was forced (upon the air I &s;poke this with, and Charlotte's and all the re&s;t reddening) to make a mouth that was big enough to &s;wallow up the other half of his face; crying out, to avoid laughing, Oh! Oh!&mdash;as if under the power of a gouty twinge.</P>
<P>Had&s;t thou &s;een how the two tabbies, and the young grimalkins, looked at one another, at my Lord, and at me, by turns, thou too would&s;t have been ready to &s;plit thy ugly face ju&s;t in the middle. Thy mouth has already done half the work. And, after all, I found not &s;eldom in this conver&s;ation, that my humorous undaunted way forced a &s;mile into my &s;ervice from the prim mouths of the <HI>younger</HI> ladies e&s;pecially: For the ca&s;e not being likely to be theirs, they could not be &s;o much affected by it, as the elders; who, having had Ro&s;es of their own, would have been very loth to have had them nipt in the bud, without &s;aying, By your leave, Mrs. Ro&s;e bu&s;h, to the mother of it.</P>
<P>The next article of my indictment was for forgery; and for per&s;onating of Lady Betty and my cou&s;in Charlotte. Two &s;hocking charges! thou'lt &s;ay: And &s;o they were!&mdash; The Peer was outrageous upon the <HI>forgery</HI>-charge.
<PB N="108" REF="109">
The Ladies vow'd never to forgive the <HI>per&s;onating</HI> part. Not a peace-maker among them. So we all turn'd wo|men, and &s;colded.</P>
<P>My Lord told me, That he believed in his con&s;cience there was not a viler fellow upon <HI>God's earth,</HI> than me.&mdash; What &s;ignifies mincing the matter, &s;aid he?&mdash;And that it was not the fir&s;t time I had forged his hand.</P>
<P>To this I an&s;wer'd, that I &s;uppo&s;ed, When the &s;tatute of <HI>&s;candalum magnatum</HI> was framed, there were a good many in the peerage, who knew they de&s;erved hard names; and that that Law therefore was rather made to privilege their qualities, than to whiten their characters.</P>
<P>He called upon me to explain my&s;elf, with a <HI>Sir-r,</HI> &s;o pronounced, as to &s;hew, that one of the mo&s;t ignominious words in our language was in his head.</P>
<P>People, I &s;aid, that were fenced in by their quality, and by their years, &s;hould not take freedoms, that a man of &s;pirit could not put up with, unle&s;s he were able heartily to de&s;pi&s;e the in&s;ulter.</P>
<P>This &s;et him in a violent pa&s;&s;ion. He would &s;end for Pritchard in&s;tantly. Let Pritchard be called. He would alter his will; and all he <HI>could</HI> leave from me, he <HI>would.</HI></P>
<P>Do, do, my Lord, &s;aid I: I always valued my own plea&s;ure above your e&s;tate. But I'll let Pritchard know, that if he draws, he &s;hall &s;ign and &s;eal.</P>
<P>Why, what would I do to Pritchard? &mdash;Shaking his crazy head at me.</P>
<P>Only, what he, or any man el&s;e, writes with his pen, to de&s;poil me of what I think my right, he &s;hall &s;eal with his ears; that's all, my Lord.</P>
<P>Then the two Ladies interpo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Lady Sarah told me, That I carried things a great way; and that neither Lord M. nor any of them, de&s;erved the treatment I gave them.</P>
<P>I &s;aid, I could not bear to be u&s;ed ill by my Lord, for two rea&s;ons; fir&s;t, Becau&s;e I re&s;pected his Lord&s;hip above any man living; and next, Becau&s;e it look'd as if I were induced by &s;elfi&s;h con&s;iderations, to take that from Him, which nobody el&s;e would offer to me.</P>
<P>And what, return'd he, &s;hall be my inducement to take what I do at your hands?&mdash;Hay, Sir?</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="110">Indeed, cou&s;in Lovelace, &s;aid Lady Betty, with great gravity, we do not any of us, as Lady Sarah &s;ays, de&s;erve at your hands the treatment you give us: And let me tell you, that I don't think my character, and your cou&s;in Charlotte's, ought to be pro&s;tituted, in order to ruin an innocent lady. She mu&s;t have known early the good opinion we all have of her, and how much we wi&s;hed her to be your wife. This good opinion of ours has been an inducement to her

<P>Why this is talking &s;omewhat like. I would have you all di&s;claim my actions. I own I have done very vilely by this lady. One &s;tep led to another. I am cur&s;t with an enterpri&s;ing &s;pirit. I hate to be foiled.</P>

<P>interrupted Lady Sarah. What a &s;hame to talk at this rate!&mdash;Did the lady &s;et up a contention with you?

She de|&s;erved a better fate from the man for whom &s;he took the &s;tep which &s;he &s;o freely blames!</P>
</SP>
<P>This above half affected me &mdash; Had this di&s;pute been &s;o handled by every one, I had been a&s;hamed to look up. I began to be ba&s;hful.&mdash;</P>
<P>Charlotte a&s;k'd, If I did not &s;till &s;eem inclinable to do the lady ju&s;tice, if &s;he would have <HI>me?</HI> It would be, &s;he dared to &s;ay, the greate&s;t felicity the family could know (She would an&s;wer for one), that this fine lady were of it.</P>
<P>They all declared to the &s;ame effect; and Lady Sarah put the matter home to me.</P>
<P>But my Lord <HI>Marplot</HI> would have it, that I could not be &s;erious for &s;ix minutes together.</P>
<P>I told his Lord&s;hip, that he was mi&s;taken; light as he thought I made of this &s;ubject, I never knew any that went &s;o near my heart.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="111">Mi&s;s Patty &s;aid, She was glad to hear <HI>that:</HI> Indeed &s;he was glad to hear <HI>that:</HI> And her &s;oft eyes gli&s;tened with plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Lord M. called her Sweet &s;oul, and was ready to cry.</P>
<P>Not from humanity neither, Jack. This Peer has no bowels; as thou may'&s;t ob&s;erve by his treatment of <HI>me.</HI> But when peoples minds are weaken'd by a &s;en&s;e of their own infirmities, and when they are drawing on to their latter ends, they will be moved on the &s;lighte&s;t occa&s;ions, whether tho&s;e offer from <HI>within,</HI> or <HI>without</HI> them. And this, frequently, the unpenetrating world calls <HI>humanity,</HI> when all the time, in compa&s;&s;ionating the mi&s;eries of human nature, they are but pitying them&s;elves; and were they in &s;trong health and &s;pirits, would care as little for any-body el&s;e as thou or I do.</P>
<P>Here broke they off my tryal for this Sitting. Lady Sarah was much fatigued. It was agreed to pur&s;ue the &s;ub|ject in the morning They all, however, retired together, and went into private conference.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXI. <HI>Mr.</HI> LOVELACE. <HI>In Continuation.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Ladies, in&s;tead of taking up the &s;ubject where we had laid it down, mu&s;t needs touch upon pa&s;|&s;ages in my fair accu&s;er's letter, which I was in hopes they would have let re&s;t, as we were in a tolerable way. But, truly, they mu&s;t hear all they could hear, of our &s;tory, and what I had to &s;ay to tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, that they might be better enabled to mediate between us, if I were really and indeed inclined to do her the hoped-for ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The&s;e pa&s;&s;ages were, 1&s;t,
<Q>That after I had trick'd her, again&s;t her will, into the act of going off with me, I carried her to one of the wor&s;t hou&s;es in London.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. "That I had made a wicked attempt upon her; in "re&s;entment of which, &s;he fled to Ham&s;tead, privately.</P>

<P><PB N="111" REF="112">For that, 4thly, was,
<Q>That having trick'd her back to the vile hou&s;e, I had fir&s;t robbed her of her &s;en&s;es, and then of her honour; detaining her afterwards a pri&s;oner there.</Q></P>
<P>Were I to tell thee the glo&s;&s;es I put upon the&s;e heavy charges, what would it be, but to repeat many of the extenuating arguments I have u&s;ed in my letters to thee? &mdash;Suffice it, therefore, to &s;ay, that I in&s;i&s;ted much, by way of palliation, on the lady's extreme nicene&s;s: On her diffidence in my honour: On Mi&s;s Howe's contriving &s;pirit; plots on their parts, begetting plots on mine: On the high pa&s;&s;ions of the &s;ex: I a&s;&s;erted, that my whole view, in gently re&s;training her, was to oblige her to for|give me, and to marry me; and this, for the honour of both families. I boa&s;ted of my own good qualities; &s;ome of which none that know me, deny; and which few libertines can lay claim to.</P>
<P>They then fell into warm admirations and prai&s;es of the lady; all of them preparatory, as I knew, to the grand que&s;tion: And thus it was introduced by Lady Sarah.</P>
<P>We have &s;aid as much as I think we can &s;ay, upon the&s;e letters of the poor lady.

But you &s;eem, Sir, &s;till to have a ju&s;t opinion of her, as well as affection for her. Her virtue is not in the lea&s;t que&s;tionable. She could not re&s;ent as &s;he does, had &s;he any thing to reproach her&s;elf with. She is, by every-body's account, a fine woman; has a good e&s;tate in her own right; is of no contemptible family; tho' I think with regard to her, they have acted as imprudently as unworthily. For the excellency of her mind, for good oeconomy, the common &s;peech of her, as the worthy Dr. Lewin once told me, is, <HI>That her prudence would enrich a poor man, and her piety reclaim a licentious one.</HI> I, who have not been abroad twice this twelvemonth, came hither purpo&s;ely, &s;o did Lady Betty, to &s;ee if ju&s;tice may not be done her; and al&s;o whether we, and my Lord M.

<Q><P>I am very &s;en&s;ible, that the performance of the ta&s;k you have put me upon, will leave me without excu&s;e: But I will not have recour&s;e either to eva&s;ion, or pal|liation.</P>
<P>As my cou&s;in Charlotte has &s;everely ob&s;erv'd, I am not <HI>a&s;ham'd</HI> to do ju&s;tice to Mi&s;s Harlowe's merit in words, altho' I will confe&s;s, that I ought to blu&s;h that I have done it &s;o little in deeds.</P>
<P>I own to <HI>you</HI> all, and, what is more, with high regret (if not with <HI>&s;hame,</HI> cou&s;in Charlotte), that I have a
<PB N="114" REF="115">
great deal to an&s;wer for in my u&s;age of this lady. The Sex has not a nobler mind, nor a lovelier per&s;on of it. And, for <HI>virtue,</HI> I could not have believed (excu&s;e me, Ladies) that there ever was a woman who <HI>gave,</HI> or <HI>could</HI> have given, &s;uch illu&s;trious, &s;uch uniform proofs of it: For, in her whole conduct, &s;he has &s;hewn her&s;elf to be equally above temptation and art; and, I had almo&s;t &s;aid, human frailty.</P>
<P>The &s;tep &s;he &s;o freely blames her&s;elf for taking, was truly what &s;he calls <HI>compul&s;atory:</HI> For tho' &s;he was pro|voked to <HI>think</HI> of going off with me, &s;he intended it not, nor was provided to do &s;o: Neither would &s;he ever have had the <HI>thought</HI> of it, had her relations left her free, upon her offer'd compo&s;ition, to renounce the man &s;he did <HI>not</HI> hate, in order to avoid the man &s;he <HI>did.</HI></P>
<P>It piqu'd my pride, I own, that I could &s;o little de|pend upon the force of tho&s;e impre&s;&s;ions, which I had the vanity to hope I had made in a heart &s;o delicate; and in my wor&s;t devices again&s;t her, I encouraged my|&s;elf, that I abu&s;ed no confidence; for none had &s;he in my honour.</P>
<P>The evils &s;he has &s;uffer'd, it would have been more than a miracle had &s;he avoided. [<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er watchfulne&s;s render'd more plots abortive, than tho&s;e which con|tributed to her fall; and they were many and various. And all her greater trials and hard&s;hips were owing to her oble re&s;i&s;tance and ju&s;t re&s;entment.</P>
<P>I know, proceeded I, how much I condemn my&s;elf in the ju&s;tice I am doing to this excellent creature. But yet I <HI>will</HI> do her ju&s;tice, and cannot help it if I would. And I hope this &s;hews, that I am not &s;o to|tally abandon'd, as I have been thought to be.</P>
<P>Indeed with me, &s;he has done more honour to hte Sex in her fall, if it be to be called a fall (In truth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ought not), than ever any other could do in her &s;tand|ing.</P>
<P>When, at length, I had given her watchful virt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> cau&s;e of &s;u&s;picion, I was then indeed obliged to mak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> u&s;e of power and art to hinder her from e&s;caping fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> me.

More than once, ju&s;tly did &s;he tell me, fired by con&s;cious worthine&s;s, that her &s;oul was my &s;oul's &s;uperior!&mdash;Forgive me, Ladies, for &s;aying, that till I knew <HI>her,</HI> I que&s;tion'd a Soul in a Sex, created, as I was willing to &s;uppo&s;e, only for temporary purpo&s;es.&mdash;It is not to be imagin'd into what ab&s;urdities men of free principles run, in order to ju&s;tify to them&s;elves their free practices; and to make a religion to their minds: And yet, in this re&s;pect, I have not been &s;o faulty as &s;ome others.</P>
<P>No wonder that &s;uch a noble creature as this looked upon every &s;tudied artifice, as a degree of ba&s;ene&s;s, not to be forgiven: No wonder that &s;he could &s;o ea&s;ily become aver&s;e to the man (tho' once &s;he beheld him with an eye not wholly indifferent) whom &s;he thought capable of premeditated guilt.&mdash;Nor, give me leave, on the other hand, to &s;ay, is it to be wonder'd at, that the man who found it &s;o difficult to be forgiven, for the <HI>&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ghter</HI> offences, and who had not the grace to recede or repent (made de&s;perate), &s;hould be hurried on to the commi&s;&s;ion of the <HI>greater.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;hort, Ladies, in a word, my Lord, Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe is an angel; if ever there was or could be one in human nature: And is, and ever was, as pure as an angel in her will: And this ju&s;tice I mu&s;t do her, altho' the que&s;tion, I &s;ee by every gli&s;tening eye, is ready to be a&s;ked, What, then, Lovelace, are you?&mdash;</P></Q>

<P>They all joined in this demand.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXII. <HI>Mr.</HI> LOVELACE. <HI>In Continuation.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is much better, Jack, to tell your own &s;tory, when it <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be know, than to have an adver&s;ary tell it for you. Con&s;cious of this, I gave them a particular ac|count, how urgent I had been with her to fix upon the Thur&s;day after I left her (it being her uncle Harlowe's anniver&s;ary birth-day, and named to oblige her) for the private celebration; having &s;ome days before actually procured a Licence, which &s;till remained with her.</P>
<P>That, not being able to prevail upon her to promi&s;e any thing, while under a &s;uppo&s;ed re&s;traint; I offered to leave her at full liberty, if &s;he would give me the lea&s;t hope for that day. But neither did this offer avail me.</P>
<P>That this inflexiblene&s;s making me de&s;perate, I re|&s;olved to add to my former fault, by giving directions, that &s;he &s;hould not either go, or corre&s;pond, out of the hou&s;e, till I returned from M. Hall; well knowing, that, if &s;he were at full liberty, I mu&s;t for ever lo&s;e her.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="118">That this con&s;traint had &s;o much incen&s;ed her, that altho' I wrote no le&s;s than four different letters, I could not procure a &s;ingle word in an&s;wer; tho' I pre&s;&s;ed her but for four words to &s;ignify the day and the church.</P>
<P>I referred to my two cou&s;ins to vouch for me the extra|ordinary methods I took to &s;end me&s;&s;engers to town, tho' they knew not the occa&s;ion: Which now I told them, was <HI>this.</HI></P>
<P>I acquainted them, that I even had wrote to you, Jack, and to another gentleman, of whom I thought &s;he had a good opinion, to attend her, in order to pre&s;s for her compliance; holding my&s;elf in readine&s;s the la&s;t day, at Salt-hill, to meet the me&s;&s;enger they &s;hould &s;end, and proceed to London, if his me&s;&s;age were favourable: But that, before they could attend her, &s;he had found means to fly away once more: And is now, &s;aid I, perch'd per|haps, &s;omewhere under Lady Betty's window at Glenham Hall; and there, like the &s;weet Philomela, a thorn in her brea&s;t, warbles forth her melancholy complaints again&s;t her barbarous Tereus.</P>
<P>Lady Betty declared, That &s;he was not with <HI>her;</HI> nor did &s;he know where &s;he was. She &s;hould be, &s;he added, the mo&s;t welcome gue&s;t to her, that &s;he ever received.</P>
<P>In truth, I had a &s;u&s;picion, that &s;he was already in their knowlege, and taken into their protection; for Lady Sarah I imagin'd incapable of being rou&s;ed to this &s;pirit by a letter only from Mi&s;s Harlowe, and that not directed to her&s;elf; &s;he being a very indolent and melancholy wo|man. But her &s;i&s;ter, I find, had wrought her up to it: For Lady Betty is as officious and managing a woman as Mrs. Howe; but of a much more generous and noble di&s;po&s;ition.&mdash;She is <HI>my aunt,</HI> Jack.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;ed, I &s;aid, that her Lady&s;hip might have a pri|vate direction where to &s;end to her. I &s;poke, as I wi&s;h'd: I would have given the world, to have heard, that &s;he was inclined to cultivate the intere&s;t of any of my family.</P>
<P>Lady Betty an&s;wer'd, that &s;he had no direction but what was in the letter; which &s;he had &s;cratched out, and which, it was probable, was only a temporary one, in order to avoid me: Otherwi&s;e &s;he would hardly have directed an an&s;wer to be left at an inn. And &s;he was of opinion, that
<PB N="118" REF="119">
to apply to Mi&s;s Howe would be the only certain way to &s;ucceed in any application for forgivene&s;s, would I enable that young lady to intere&s;t her&s;elf in procuring it.</P>

<P>Permit me to make a propo&s;al.&mdash;Since we are all of one mind in relation to the ju&s;tice due to Mi&s;s Harlowe, if Mr. Lovelace will oblige him&s;elf to marry her, I will make Mi&s;s Howe a vi&s;it, little as I am acquainted with her; and endeavour to engage her intere&s;t to forward the de&s;ired reconciliation. And if this can be done, I make no que&s;tion but all may be happily accom|modated; for every-body knows the love there is between Mi&s;s Harlowe and Mi&s;s Howe.</P>

<P>Then was the per&s;onal character of the lady, as well as her more extraordinary talents and endowments, again expatiated upon: And Mi&s;s Patty, who had once &s;een her, launched out more than all the re&s;t in her prai&s;e. The&s;e were followed by <HI>Family-cogencies;</HI> what never are forgotten to be inquired after in marriage-treaties, the <HI>principal inducements</HI> to the <HI>Sages</HI> of a family, and the <HI>lea&s;t to be mentioned</HI> by the <HI>Parties</HI> them&s;elves, altho' even by <HI>them,</HI> perhaps, the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> thought of: That is to &s;ay, inqui|&s;ition into the lady's fortune; into the particulars of the grandfather's e&s;tate; and what her father, and her &s;ingle-&s;oul'd uncles, will probably do for her, if a reconciliation be effected; as, by <HI>their</HI> means, they make no doubt but it will, between both families, if it be not my fault. The two Venerables [No longer Tabbies with me now] hinted at rich pre&s;ents on their own parts; and my Lord declared, that he would make &s;uch overtures in my behalf, as &s;hould render my marriage with Mi&s;s Harlowe the be&s;t day's work I ever made; and what, he doubted not, but would be as agreeable to that family, as to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Thus, at pre&s;ent, by a &s;ingle hair, hangs over my head the matrimonial &s;word. And thus ended my tryal. And thus are we all friends; and Cou&s;in and Cou&s;in, and Nephew and Nephew, at every word.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Wedn. July</HI> 12.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>SO, Jack, they think they have gain'd a mighty point. But, <HI>were</HI> I to change my mind, were I to repent, I fancy I am &s;afe.&mdash;And yet this very moment it ri&s;es to my mind, that 'tis hard tru&s;ting too; for &s;urely there mu&s;t be &s;ome embers, where there was fire &s;o lately, that may be &s;tirr'd up to give a blaze to combu&s;tibles &s;trew'd lightly upon them. Love (like &s;ome &s;elf-propagating plants or
<PB N="120" REF="121">
roots, which have taken &s;trong hold in the earth), when once got deep into the heart, is hardly ever <HI>totally</HI> extir|pated, except by Matrimony indeed, which is the Grave of Love, becau&s;e it allows of the End of Love. Then the&s;e ladies, all advocates <HI>for</HI> her&s;elf, <HI>with</HI> her&s;elf, Mi&s;s Howe at their head, perhaps &mdash; Not in favour to me &mdash; I don't expect That from Mi&s;s Howe. &mdash;But perhaps in favour to <HI>her&s;elf:</HI> For Mi&s;s Howe has rea&s;on to apprehend vengeance from me, I ween. Her Hickman will be &s;afe too, as &s;he may think, if I marry her beloved friend: For he has been a bu&s;y fellow, and I have long wi&s;h'd to have a &s;lap at him! &mdash;The lady's ca&s;e de&s;perate with her friends too; and likely to be &s;o, while &s;ingle, and her character expo&s;ed to cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>A hu&s;band is a charming cloak; a fig-leaf'd apron for a wife: And for a lady to be protected in liberties, in di|ver&s;ions, which her hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> pants after&mdash;and all her faults, even the mo&s;t criminal, were &s;he to be detected, to be thrown upon the hu&s;band, and the ridicule too; a charm|ing eligible for a wife!</P>
<P>But I &s;hall have one comfort, if I marry, which plea&s;es me not a little. If a man's wife has a dear friend of her &s;ex, a hundred liberties may be taken with that friend, which could <HI>not</HI> be taken, if the <HI>&s;ingle lady</HI> (knowing what a title to freedoms marriage has given him with her <HI>friend</HI>) was not le&s;s &s;crupulous with him than &s;he ought to be, as to <HI>her&s;elf.</HI> Then there are <HI>broad</HI> freedoms (&s;hall I call them?) that may be taken by the hu&s;band with his wife, that may not be <HI>quite</HI> &s;hocking, which if the wife <HI>bears before her friend,</HI> will &s;erve for a le&s;&s;on to <HI>that friend;</HI> and if that friend <HI>bears</HI> to be pre&s;ent at them without check or ba&s;h|fulne&s;s, will &s;hew a &s;agacious fellow, that &s;he can bear as much her&s;elf, at <HI>proper time</HI> and <HI>place. Cha&s;tity,</HI> Jack, like <HI>Piety,</HI> is an uniform thing. If in <HI>look,</HI> if in <HI>&s;peech,</HI> a girl gives way to undue levity, depent upon it, the de|vil has got one of his cloven feet in her heart already&mdash; So, Hickman, take care of thy&s;elf, I advi&s;e thee, whether I marry or not.</P>
<P>Thus, Jack, have I at once reconciled my&s;elf to all my relations&mdash;And, if the lady refu&s;es me, thrown the fault upon her. This, I knew, would be in my power
<PB N="121" REF="122">
to do at any time: And I was the more arrogant to them, in order to heighten the merit of my compliance.</P>
<P>But after all, It would be very whim&s;ical, would it not, if all my plots and contrivances &s;hould end in wedlock? What a puni&s;hment would this come out to be, upon my|&s;elf too, that all this while I have been plundering my own trea&s;ury?</P>
<P>But, Jack, two things I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t upon with thee, if this is to be the ca&s;e.&mdash;Having put &s;ecrets of &s;o high a nature between me and my &s;pou&s;e into thy power, I mu&s;t, for my own honour and the honour of my wife and my illu&s;trious progeny, fir&s;t oblige thee to give up the letters I have &s;o profu&s;ely &s;cribbled to thee; and, in the next place, do by thee, as I have heard whi&s;per'd in France was done by the <HI>true</HI> father of a certain monarque; that is to &s;ay, cut thy throat, to prevent thy telling of tales.</P>
<P>I have found means to heighten the kind opinion my friends here have begun to have of me, by communicating to them the contents of the four la&s;t letters which I wrote to pre&s;s my elected &s;pou&s;e to &s;olemnize. My Lord has repeated one of his phra&s;es in my favour, that he hopes it will come out, <HI>That the devil is not quite &s;o black as he is painted.</HI></P>
<P>Now pr'ythee, dear Jack, &s;ince &s;o many good con&s;e|quences are to flow from the&s;e our nuptials (one of which to <HI>thy&s;elf;</HI> &s;ince the &s;ooner thou die&s;t, the le&s;s thou wilt have to an&s;wer for); and that I now-and-then am apt to believe there may be &s;omething in the old fellow's notion, who once told us, that he who kills a man, has all that man's &s;ins to an&s;wer for, as well as his own, becau&s;e he gave him not the time to repent of them, that Heaven de&s;ign'd to allow him (A fine thing for thee, if thou con|&s;ente&s;t to be knock'd of the head; but a cur&s;ed one for the man&s;layer!); and &s;ince there may be room to fear, that Mi&s;s Howe will not give us her help; I pr'ythee now exert thy&s;elf to find out my Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe, that I may make a LOVELACE of her. Set all the city bellmen, and the country criers, for ten miles round the metropolis, at work, with their

of Lord M. and his two Si&s;ters, to de&s;ire my intere&s;t to engage you to put your&s;elf into the protection of Lady Betty Lawrance; who will not part with you, till &s;he &s;ees all the ju&s;tice done you, that now can be done.</P>
<P>Lady Sarah Sadleir had not &s;tirr'd out for a twelve|month before, never &s;ince &s;he lo&s;t her agreeable daughter, whom you and I &s;aw at Mrs. Ben&s;on's: But was induced to take this journey by her &s;i&s;ter, purely to procure you reparation, if po&s;&s;ible. And their joint &s;trength, united with Lord M.'s, has &s;o far &s;ucceeded, that the wretch has bound him&s;elf to them, and to the&s;e young ladies, in the &s;olemne&s;t manner, to wed you in their pre&s;ence, if they can prevail upon you to give him your hand.</P>
<P>This con&s;olation you may take to your&s;elf, that all this honourable family have a <HI>duc,</HI> that is, the <HI>highe&s;t</HI> &s;en&s;e of your merit, and greatly admire you. The horrid creature has not &s;pared him&s;elf in doing ju&s;tice to you virtue; and the young ladies gave us &s;uch an account of his confe&s;&s;ions, and &s;elf-condemnation, that my mother was quite charmed with you; and we all four &s;hed tears of joy, that there is one of our &s;ex (I, that that one is my deare&s;t friend), who has done &s;o much honour to it, as to de&s;erve the &s;elf-convicted prai&s;es he gave you; tho' pity for the excellent creature mixed with the &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>He promi&s;es by them to make the be&s;t of husbands; and my Lord, and his two &s;i&s;ters, are both to be guaran|tees that he will be &s;o. Noble &s;ettlements, noble pre&s;ents, they talked of: They &s;ay, they left Lord M. and his two &s;i&s;ters talking of nothing el&s;e but of tho&s;e pre&s;ents and &s;ettlements, how mo&s;t to do you honour, the greater in proportion for the indignities you have &s;uffered; and of changing of names by act of parliament, preparative to the intere&s;t they will all join to make, to get the titles to go where the bulk of the e&s;tate mu&s;t go, at my Lord's death, which they apprehend to be nearer than they wi&s;h. Nor doubt they of a thorough reformation in his morals, from your example, and influence over him.</P>
<P>I made a great many objections for you&mdash;All, I believe, that you could have made your&s;elf, had you been pre&s;ent. But I have no doubt to advi&s;e you, my dear (and &s;o does my mother), in&s;tantly to put your&s;elf into Lady Betty's
<PB N="124" REF="125">
protection, with a re&s;olution to take the wretch for your husband: All his future grandeur (he wants not pride) depends upon his &s;incerity to you; and the young ladies vouch for the depth of his concern for the wrongs he has done you.</P>
<P>All his apprehen&s;ion is, in your readine&s;s to communi|cate to every one, as he fears, the evils you have &s;uffer'd; which he thinks will expo&s;e you both. But had you not revealed them to Lady Betty, you had not had &s;o warm a friend; &s;ince it is owing to two letters you wrote to her, that all this good, as I hope it will prove, was brought about. But I advi&s;e you to be more &s;paring in expo&s;ing what is pa&s;t, whether you have thoughts of accepting him, or not: For what, my dear, can that avail now, but to give a handle to vile wretches to triumph over your friends; &s;ince every one will not know how much to your honour your very &s;ufferings have been?</P>
<P>Your melancholy letter brought by Rogers <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Letter <HI>xxvii.</HI> p. <HI>89.</HI> preceding.</NOTE> with his account of your indifferent health, confirmed to Ro|gers by the woman of the hou&s;e, as well as by your looks, and by your faintne&s;s while you talk'd with him, would have given me inexpre&s;&s;ible affliction, had I not been chear'd by this agreeable vi&s;it from the young ladies. I hope you will be equally &s;o, on my imparting the &s;ubject of it to you.</P>
<P>Indeed, my dear, you mu&s;t not he&s;itate: You <HI>mu&s;t</HI> oblige them: The alliance is &s;plendid and honourable. Very few will know any thing of his brutal ba&s;ene&s;s to you. All mu&s;t end, in a little while, in a general recon|ciliation; and you will be able to re&s;ume your cour&s;e of doing the good to every de&s;erving object, which procured you ble&s;&s;ings where-ever you &s;et your foot.</P>
<P>I am concern'd to find, that your father's ra&s;h wi&s;h af|fects you &s;o much as it does. Upon my word, my dear, your mind is weaken'd grievou&s;ly. You mu&s;t not, indeed you mu&s;t not, de&s;ert your&s;elf. The penitence you talk of&mdash; It is for <HI>them</HI> to be penitent who hurried you into evils you could not well avoid. You judge by the un|happy event, rather than upon the true merits of your ca&s;e. Upon my honour, I think you faultle&s;s in almo&s;t every
<PB N="125" REF="126">
&s;tep you have taken. What has not that vilely in&s;olent and ambitious, yet &s;tupid, brother of yours to an&s;wer for?&mdash;That &s;piteful thing your &s;i&s;ter too!&mdash;</P>
<P>But come, &s;ince what is pa&s;t cannot be help'd, let us look forward. You have now happy pro&s;pects opening to you: A family, <HI>already nobl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> ready to receive and embrace you with open arms and joyful hearts; and who, by their love to you, will teach another family (who know not what an excellence they have confederated to per&s;ecute) how to value you. Your prudence, your piety, will crown all: It will reclaim a wretch, that for an hundred &s;akes more than for his own, one would wi&s;h to be reclaimed.</P>
<P>Like a traveller, who has been put out of his way by the overflowing of &s;ome rapid &s;tream, you have only had the fore-right path you were in overwhelmed. A few miles about, a day or two only lo&s;t, as I may &s;ay, and you are in a way to recover it; and, by quickening your &s;peed, will get up the lo&s;t time. The hurry upon your &s;pirits, mean time, will be all your inconvenience; for it was not your fault you were &s;topt in your progre&s;s.</P>
<P>Think of this, my dear; and improve upon the alle|gory, as you know how. If you can, without impeding your progre&s;s, be the means of a&s;&s;uaging the inundation; of bounding the waters within their natural channel, and thereby of recovering the overwhelmed path for the &s;ake of future pa&s;&s;engers who travel the &s;ame way, what a merit will yours be!&mdash;</P>
<P>I &s;hall impatiently expect your next letter. The young ladies propo&s;ed, that you &s;hould put your&s;elf, if in town, or near it, into the Reading &s;tage-coach, which inns &s;omewhere in Fleet-&s;treet: And if you give notice of the day, you will be met on the road, and that pretty early in your journey, by &s;ome of both &s;exes; one of whom you won't be &s;orry to &s;ee.</P>
<P>Mr. Hickman &s;hall attend you at Slough; and Lady Betty her&s;elf, and one of the Mi&s;&s;es Montague, with proper equipages, will be at Reading to receive you; and carry you directly to the &s;eat of the former: For I have ex|pre&s;ly &s;tipulated, that the wretch him&s;elf &s;hall not come

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Tue&s;day Morning, July</HI> 18.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Take the liberty to write to you, by this &s;pecial me&s;|&s;enger: In the phren&s;y of my &s;oul I write to you, to demand of you, and of any of your family who can tell, news of my beloved friend; who, I doubt, has been &s;pi|rited away by the ba&s;e arts of one of the blacke&s;t&mdash;O help me to a name bad enough to call him by!&mdash;Her piety is proof again&s;t &s;elf-attempts: It mu&s;t, it mu&s;t be Him, the only Him, who would injure &s;uch an innocent; and now&mdash; who knows what he was done with her!</P>
<P>If I have patience, I will give you the occa&s;ion of this di&s;tracted vehemence.</P>
<P>I wrote to her the very moment you and your &s;i&s;ter left me. But being unable to procure a &s;pecial me&s;&s;enger, as I intended, was forced to &s;end by the po&s;t. I urged her (you know, I promi&s;ed, that I would), I urged her with earne&s;tne&s;s, to comply with the de&s;ires of all your family. Having no an&s;wer, I wrote again on Sunday night; and &s;ent it by a particular hand, who travelled all night; chide|ing her for keeping a heart &s;o impatient as mine in &s;uch cruel &s;u&s;pen&s;e, upon a matter of &s;o much importance to
<PB N="128" REF="129">
her; and therefore to me. And very angry I was with her in my mind.</P>
<P>But, judge my a&s;toni&s;hment, my di&s;traction, when la&s;t night, the me&s;&s;enger, returning po&s;t-ha&s;te, brought me word, that &s;he had not been heard of &s;ince Friday morn|ing! And that a letter lay for her at her lodgings, which came by the po&s;t; and mu&s;t be mine.</P>
<P>She went out about &s;ix that morning; only intending, as they believe, to go to morning prayers at Covent-gar|den church, ju&s;t by her lodgings, as &s;he had done divers times before: Went on foot!&mdash;Left word &s;he &s;hould be back in an hour&mdash;Very poorly in health!</P>
<P>Lord, have mercy upon me! What &s;hall I do!&mdash;I was a di&s;tracted creature all la&s;t night!</P>
<P>O Madam! You know not how I love her!&mdash;She was my earthly &s;aviour, as I may &s;ay!&mdash;My own &s;oul is not dearer to me, than my Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe!&mdash;Nay, &s;he <HI>is</HI> my &s;oul!&mdash;For I now have none! &mdash; Only a mi&s;erable one, however!&mdash;For &s;he was the joy, the &s;tay, the prop of my life! Never woman loved woman as we love one another! It is impo&s;&s;ible to tell you half her excellencies. It was my glory and my pride, that I was capable of &s;o fervent a love of &s;o pure and matchle&s;s a creature!&mdash;But now!&mdash; Who knows, whether the dear injured has not all her woes, her unde&s;erved woes! completed in death; or is not re&s;erved for a wor&s;e fate!&mdash;This I leave to your in|quiry&mdash;For&mdash;your&mdash;(&s;hall I call the man&mdash;your) relation, I under&s;tand, is &s;till with you.</P>
<P>Surely, my good Ladies, you were well authorized in the propo&s;als you made me in pre&s;ence of my mother! Surely he dare not abu&s;e your confidence, and the confi|dence of your noble relations.

<P>ALL undone, undone, by Jupiter!&mdash;Zounds, Jack, what &s;hall I do now! A cur&s;e upon all my plots and contrivances!&mdash;But I have it!&mdash;In the very heart and &s;oul of me, I have it!</P>
<P>Thou tolde&s;t me, that my puni&s;hments were but begin|ning! &mdash;Can&s;t thou, O fatal progno&s;ticator! can&s;t thou tell me, where they will end?</P>
<P>Thy a&s;&s;i&s;tance I be&s;peak: The moment thou receive&s;t this, I be&s;peak thy a&s;&s;i&s;tance. This me&s;&s;enger rides for life and death!&mdash;And I hope he'll find you at your town-lodgings; if he meet not with you at Edgware; where, being Sunday, he will call fir&s;t.</P>
<P>This cur&s;ed, cur&s;ed woman, on Friday di&s;patched man and hor&s;e with the joyful news, as &s;he thought it would be to me, in an exulting letter from Sally Martin, that &s;he had found out my angel as on Wedne&s;day la&s;t; and on Friday morning, after &s;he had been at prayers at Covent-garden church&mdash;praying for my reformation, perhaps!&mdash; got her arre&s;ted by two &s;heriffs officers, as &s;he was return|ing to her lodgings, who put her into a chair they had in readine&s;s, and carried her to one of the cur&s;ed fellows hou&s;es.</P>
<P>She has arre&s;ted her for 150 <HI>l.</HI> pretendedly due for board and lodgings: A &s;um, be&s;ides the low villainy of the pro|ceeding, which the dear &s;oul could not po&s;&s;ibly rai&s;e; all her cloaths and effects, except what &s;he had on, and with her, when &s;he went away, being at the old devil's!</P>
<P>And here, for an aggravation, has the dear creature lain already two days; for I mu&s;t be gallanting my two aunts and my two cou&s;ins, and giving Lord M. an airing after his lying-in: Pox upon the whole family of us!&mdash; And returned not till within this hour: And now returned to my di&s;traction, on receiving the cur&s;ed tidings, and the exulting letter.</P>

de&s;erved not This!&mdash;I dare not &s;tir!&mdash; It will be thought done by my contrivance:&mdash;And if I am ab&s;ent from this place, that will confirm the &s;u&s;picion.</P>

<P>Ha&s;ten to her!&mdash;Clear me of this cur&s;ed job. Mo&s;t &s;incerely, by all that's &s;acred, I &s;wear you may!&mdash;Yet have I been &s;uch a villainous plotter, that the charming &s;ufferer will hardly believe it; altho' the proceeding be &s;o dirtily low!</P>
<P>Set her free, the moment you &s;ee her: Without condi|tioning, free!&mdash;On your knees, for me, beg her pardon: And a&s;&s;ure her, that, where-ever &s;he goes, I will not mo|le&s;t her: No, nor come near her, without her leave: And be &s;ure allow not any of the damned crew to go near her&mdash; Only, let her permit <HI>you</HI> to receive her commands from time to time: You have always been her friend and ad|vocate. What would I now give, had I permitted you to have been a &s;ucce&s;sful one!</P>
<P>Let her have all her cloaths and effects &s;ent her in&s;tant|ly, as a &s;mall proof of my &s;incerity. And force upon the dear creature, who mu&s;t be moneyle&s;s, what &s;ums you can get her to take. Let me know, how &s;he has been treated: If roughly, woe be to the guilty!</P>
<P>Take thy watch in thy hand, after thou ha&s;t freed her, and damn the whole brood, dragon and &s;erpents, by the hour, till thou'rt tired; and tell them, I bid thee do &s;o, for their cur&s;ed officiou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>They had nothing to do, when they had found her, but to wait my orders how to proceed.</P>
<P>The great devil fly away with them all, one by one, thro' the roof of their own cur&s;ed hou&s;e, and da&s;h them to pieces again&s;t the tops of chimneys, as he flies; and let the le&s;&s;er devils collect their &s;cattered &s;craps, and bag them up, in order to put them together again in their al|lotted place, in the element of fire, with cements of mol|ten lead.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN pur&s;uance of my promi&s;e, I will minutely inform you of every-thing we know, relating to this &s;chock|ing tran&s;action.</P>
<P>When we returned from you on Thur&s;day night, and made our report of the kind reception both we and our me&s;&s;age met with, in that you had been &s;o good as to pro|mi&s;e to u&s;e your intere&s;t with your dear friend; it put us all into &s;uch good humour with one another, and with my cou&s;in Lovelace, that we re&s;olved upon a little tour of two days, the Friday and Saturday, in order to give an airing to my Lord, and Lady S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rah; both having been long confined, one by illne&s;s, the other by melancholy. My Lord, his two &s;i&s;ters, and my&s;elf, were in the coach; and all our talk was of dear Mi&s;s Harlowe, and of our future happine&s;s with her. Mr. Lovelace, and my &s;i&s;ter, who is his favourite, as he is hers, were in his Phaeton: And whenever we joined company, that was &s;till the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>As to him, never man prai&s;ed a lady, as he did her: Never man gave greater hopes, and made better re&s;olu|tions. He is none of tho&s;e that are governed by intere&s;t. He is too proud for that. But mo&s;t &s;incerely delighted was he in talking of her; and of his hopes of her return|ing favour. He &s;aid, however, more than once, that he feared &s;he would not forgive him; for, from his heart, he mu&s;t &s;ay, he de&s;erved not her forgivene&s;s: And often, and often, that there was not &s;uch a woman in the world.</P>
<P>This I mention to &s;hew you, Madam, that he could not at this very time be privy to &s;uch a barbarous and di&s;graceful treatment.</P>
<P>We returned not till Saturday night, all in as good hu|mour with one another, as went out. We never had &s;uch plea&s;ure in his company before: If he would be good, and as he ought to be, no man would be better be|loved by relations than he. But never was there a greater alteration in man when he came home, and received a
<PB N="133" REF="134">
letter from a me&s;&s;enger, who, it &s;eems, had been flatter|ing him&s;elf in hopes of a reward, and had been waiting for his return from the night before. In <HI>&s;uch</HI> a fury!&mdash; The man fared but badly. He in&s;tantly &s;hut him&s;elf up to write, and ordered man and hor&s;e to be ready to &s;et out before day-light the next morning, to carry the letter to a friend in London.</P>
<P>He would not &s;ee us all that night; neither breakfa&s;t nor dine with us next day. He ought, he &s;aid, never to &s;ee the light; and bid my &s;i&s;ter, whom he called an <HI>Innocent</HI> (and &s;he being very de&s;irous to know the occa|&s;ion of all this), &s;hun him; &s;aying, He was a wretch, and made &s;o by his own inventions, and the con&s;equences of them.</P>
<P>None of us could get out of him what &s;o di&s;turbed him. We &s;hould too &s;oon hear, he &s;aid, to the utter di&s;&s;ipation of all <HI>his</HI> hopes, and all <HI>ours.</HI></P>
<P>We could ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e, that all was not right with regard to the worthy young lady.</P>
<P>He was out each day; and &s;aid, he wanted to run away from him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Late on Monday night he received a letter from Mr. Belford, his mo&s;t favoured friend, by his own me&s;&s;enger; who came back in a foam, man and hor&s;e. Whatever were the contents, he was not ea&s;ier, but like a madman rather: But &s;till would not let us know the occa&s;ion. But to my &s;i&s;ter, he &s;aid, Nobody, my dear Pat&s;ey, who can think but of half the plagues that pur&s;ue an intriguing &s;pirit, would ever quit the right path.</P>
<P>He was out, when your me&s;&s;enger came: But &s;oon came in; and bad enough was his reception from us all. And he &s;aid, that his own torments were greater than ours, than Mi&s;s Harlowe's, or yours, Madam, all put to|gether. He would &s;ee your letter. He always carries every-thing before him: And &s;aid, when he had read it, that He thanked God, he was not &s;uch a villain, as you, with too much rea&s;on, thought him.</P>
<P>Thus then he owned the matter to be:</P>
<P>He had left general directions to the people of the lodgings the dear lady went from, to find out where &s;he was gone to, if po&s;&s;ible, that he might have an opportu|nity
<PB N="134" REF="135">
to importune her to be his, before their difference was public. The wicked people, <HI>officious</HI> at lea&s;t, if not wicked, di&s;covered where &s;he was on Wedne&s;day; and, for fear &s;he &s;hould remove before they could have his or|ders, they put her under a <HI>gentle re&s;traint,</HI> as they call it; and di&s;patched away a me&s;&s;enger to acquaint him with it; and to take his orders.</P>
<P>This me&s;&s;enger arrived here on Friday afternoon; and tarried till we returned on Saturday night:&mdash;And when he read the letter he brought&mdash;I have told you, Madam, what a fury he was in.</P>
<P>The letter he retired to write, and which he di&s;patched away &s;o early on Sunday morning, was to conjure his friend Mr. Belford, on receipt of it, to fly to the lady, and &s;et her free; and to order all her things to be &s;ent her; and to clear him of &s;o black and villainous a fact, as he ju&s;tly called it.</P>
<P>And by this time, he doubts not that all is happily over; and the Beloved of his &s;oul (as he calls her at every word) in an ea&s;ier and happier way than &s;he was before the horrid fact. And now he owns, that the rea&s;on why Mr. Belford's letter &s;et him into &s;tronger ravings, was, becau&s;e of his keeping him wilfully, and on purpo&s;e to torment him, in &s;u&s;pen&s;e; and reflecting very heavily upon him (for Mr. Belford, he &s;ays, was ever the lady's friend and advocate), and only mentioning, that he had waited upon her; referring to his next for further particu|lars; which he could have told him at the time.</P>
<P>He declares, and we can vouch for him, that he ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> been, ever &s;ince la&s;t Saturday night, the mi&s;erable&s;t of men.</P>
<P>He forbore going up him&s;elf, that it might not be ima|gined he was guilty of &s;o black a contrivance; and went up to complete any ba&s;e views in con&s;equence of it.</P>
<P>Believe us all, dear Mi&s;s Howe, under the deepe&s;t con|cern at this unhappy accident; which will, we fear, ex|a&s;perate the charming &s;ufferer; not too much for the oc|ca&s;ion, but too much for our hopes.</P>
<P>O what wretches are the&s;e free-living men, who love to tread in intricate paths; and, when once they e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> know not how far out of the way their head&s;trong cour&s;e may lead them!</P>

<P>WHAT a cur&s;ed piece of work ha&s;t thou made of it, with the mo&s;t excellent of women! Thou
<PB N="136" REF="137">
maye&s;t be in earne&s;t, or in je&s;t, as thou wilt; but the poor lady will not be long either thy &s;port, or the &s;port of fortune!</P>
<P>I will give thee an account of a &s;cene that wants but her affecting pen to repre&s;ent it ju&s;tly; and it would wring all the black blood out of thy callous heart.</P>
<P>Thou only, who art the author of her calamities, &s;hould&s;t have attended her in her pri&s;on. I am unequal to &s;uch a ta&s;k: Nor know I any other man but would.</P>
<P>This la&s;t act, however unintended by thee, yet a con|&s;equence of thy general orders, and too likely to be thought agreeable to thee, by tho&s;e who know thy other villainies by her, has fini&s;hed thy barbarous work. And I advi&s;e thee to trumpet forth every-where, how much in earne&s;t thou art to marry her, whether thou art or not.</P>
<P>Thou maye&s;t <HI>&s;afely</HI> do it. She will not live to put thee to the trial; and it will a little palliate for thy enormous u&s;age of her, and be a means to make mankind, who know not what I know of the matter, herd a little longer with thee, and forbear to hunt thee to thy fellow-&s;avages in the Libyan wilds and de&s;erts.</P>
<P>Your me&s;&s;enger found me at Edgware, expecting to dinner with me &s;everal friends, whom I had invited three days before. I &s;ent apologies to them, as in a ca&s;e of life and death; and &s;peeded to town to the wicked wo|man's: For how knew I but &s;hocking attempts might be made upon her by the cur&s;ed wretches; perhaps by thy contrivance, in order to mortify her into thy mea&s;ures?</P>
<P>Little knows the public what villainies are committed in the&s;e abominable hou&s;es, upon innocent creatures drawn into their &s;nares!</P>
<P>Finding the lady not there, I po&s;ted away to the offi|cer's, altho' Sally told me, that &s;he had been but ju&s;t come from thence; and that &s;he had refu&s;ed to &s;ee her, or, as &s;he &s;ent down word, any-body el&s;e; being re&s;olved to have the remainder of that Sunday to her&s;elf, as it might, perhaps, be the la&s;t &s;he &s;hould ever &s;ee.</P>
<P>I had the &s;ame thing told me, when I got thither.</P>
<P>I &s;ent up to let her know, that I came with a commi&s;|&s;ion to &s;et her at liberty. I was afraid of &s;ending up the name of a man known to be thy friend. She ab&s;olutely
<PB N="137" REF="138">
refu&s;ed to &s;ee <HI>any man,</HI> however, for that day, or to an|&s;wer further to any thing &s;aid from me.</P>
<P>Having therefore informed my&s;elf of all that the officer, and his wife, and &s;ervant, could acquaint me with, as well in relation to the horrid arre&s;t, as to her behaviour, and the womens to her; and her ill &s;tate of health; I went back to Sinclair's, as I will &s;till call her, and heard the three womens &s;tory: From all which, I am enabled to give thee the following &s;hocking particulars: Which may &s;erve, till I can &s;ee the unhappy lady her&s;elf to-morrow, if then I can gain admittance to her. Thou wilt find, that I have been very minute in my inquiries.</P>
<P>Thy villain it was, that &s;et the poor lady, and had the impudence to appear, and abet the &s;heriff's officers in the cur&s;ed tran&s;action. He thought, no doubt, that he was doing the mo&s;t acceptable &s;ervice to his ble&s;&s;ed ma|&s;ter. They had got a chair; the head ready up, as &s;oon as Service was over. And as &s;he came out of the church, at the door fronting Bedford-&s;treet, the officers, &s;tepping to her, whi&s;pered, that they had an action again&s;t her.</P>
<P>She was terrified, trembled, and turned pale.</P>
<P><HI>Action!</HI> &s;aid &s;he. What is that?&mdash;I have committed <HI>no bad action!</HI>&mdash;Lord ble&s;s me! Men, what mean you?</P>
<P>That you are our pri&s;oner, Madam?</P>
<P><HI>Pri&s;oner,</HI> Sirs! &mdash; What&mdash;How&mdash;Why&mdash;What have I done?</P>
<P>You mu&s;t go with us. Be plea&s;ed, Madam, to &s;tep into this chair.</P>
<P>With <HI>you!</HI>&mdash;With <HI>men!</HI>&mdash;Mu&s;t go with <HI>men!</HI>&mdash;I am not u&s;ed to go with <HI>&s;trange men!</HI>&mdash;Indeed you mu&s;t ex|cu&s;e me!</P>
<P>We can't excu&s;e you: We are &s;heriff's-officers. &mdash; We have a Writ again&s;t you. You <HI>mu&s;t</HI> go with us, and you &s;hall know at who&s;e Suit.</P>
<P><HI>Suit!</HI> &s;aid the charming innocent; I don't know what you mean. Pray, men, don't lay hands upon me!&mdash;They offering to put her into the chair. I am not u&s;ed to be thus treated!&mdash;I have done nothing to de&s;erve it.</P>
<P>She then &s;pied by villain&mdash;O thou wretch, &s;aid &s;he, where is thy vile ma&s;ter?&mdash;Am I again to be <HI>his pri&s;oner?</HI> Help, good people!</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="139">A croud had before begun to gather.</P>
<P>My ma&s;ter is in the country, Madam, many miles off: If you plea&s;e to go with the&s;e men, they will treat you civilly.</P>
<P>The people were mo&s;t of them &s;truck with compa&s;&s;ion. A fine young creature! &mdash; A thou&s;and pities! &s;ome.&mdash; While &s;ome few threw out vile and &s;hocking reflections: But a gentleman interpo&s;ed, and demanded to &s;ee the fel|lows authority.</P>
<P>They &s;hewed it. Is your name Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe, Ma|dam? &s;aid he.</P>
<P>Yes, yes, indeed, ready to &s;ink, my name <HI>was</HI> Cla|ri&s;&s;a Harlowe:&mdash;But it is now <HI>Wretchedne&s;s!</HI>&mdash;Lord be merciful to me! what is to come next?</P>
<P>You <HI>mu&s;t</HI> go with the&s;e men, Madam, &s;aid the gentle|man: They have authority for what they do. He pitied her, and retired.</P>
<P>Indeed you mu&s;t, &s;aid one chairman.</P>
<P>Indeed you mu&s;t, &s;aid the other.</P>
<P>Can no-body, joined in another gentleman, be applied to, who will &s;ee that &s;o fine a creature is not ill u&s;ed?</P>
<P>Thy villain an&s;wered, Orders were given particularly for that. She had rich relations. She need but a&s;k and have. She would only be carried to the officer's hou&s;e, till matters could be made up. The people &s;he had lodged with, loved her: But &s;he had left her lodgings privately.</P>
<P>O! had &s;he tho&s;e tricks already? cried one or two.</P>
<P>She heard not this&mdash;But &s;aid, Well, if I mu&s;t go, I mu&s;t!&mdash;I cannot re&s;i&s;t&mdash;But I will not be carried to the woman's!&mdash;I will rather die at your feet, than be car|ried to the woman's!</P>
<P>You won't be carried there, Madam, cried thy fellow.</P>
<P>Only to <HI>my</HI> hou&s;e, Madam, &s;aid one of the officers.</P>
<P>Where is That?</P>
<P>In High-Holborn, Madam.</P>
<P>I know not where High-Holborn is: But any-where, except to the woman's.&mdash;But am I to go with <HI>men</HI> only?</P>
<P>Looking about her, and &s;eeing the three pa&s;&s;ages, to wit, that leading to Henrietta-&s;treet, that to King-&s;treet, and the fore-right one, to Bedford-&s;treet, crouded, &s;he &s;tarted&mdash;Any-where&mdash;Any-where, &s;aid &s;he, but to the wo|man's!
<PB N="139" REF="140">
And &s;tepping into the chair, threw her&s;elf on the &s;eat, in the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s and confu&s;ion &mdash; Carry me, carry me out of &s;ight &mdash; Cover me &mdash; Cover me up &mdash;for ever! &mdash; were her words.</P>
<P>Thy villain drew the curtains: She had not power; and they went away with her, thro' a va&s;t croud of people.</P>
<P>Here I mu&s;t re&s;t. I can write no more at pre&s;ent. Only, Lovelace, remember, <HI>All this was to a Clari&s;&s;a!!!</HI></P>
<P>THE unhappy lady fainted away when, &s;he was taken out of the chair at the officer's hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Several people followed the chair to the very hou&s;e, which is in a wretched court. Sally was there; and &s;atisfied &s;ome of the inquirers, that the young gentlewo|man would be exceedingly well u&s;ed: And they &s;oon di|&s;per&s;ed.</P>
<P>Dorcas was al&s;o there; but came not in her &s;ight. Sally, as a favour, offered to carry her to her former lodgings: But &s;he declared, they &s;hould carry her thither a corp&s;e, if they did.</P>
<P>Very gentle u&s;age the women boa&s;t of: So would a vultur, could it &s;peak, with the entrails of its prey upon its rapacious talons. Of this thou'lt judge, from what I have to recite.</P>
<P>She a&s;ked, What was meant by this u&s;age of her?&mdash; People told me, &s;aid &s;he, that I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> go with the men!&mdash; That they had authority to take me: So I &s;ubmitted. But now, what is to be the end of this di&s;graceful violence?</P>
<P>The end, &s;aid the vile Sally Martin, is, for hone&s;t peo|ple to come at their own.</P>
<P>Ble&s;s me! Have I taken away any thing that belongs to tho&s;e who have obtained this power over me?&mdash;I have left very valuable things behind me; but have taken no|thing away, that is not my own.</P>
<P>And who do you think, <HI>Mi&s;s Harlowe,</HI> for I under|&s;tand, &s;aid the cur&s;ed creature, you are not married; who do you think is to pay for your board and your lodgings; &s;uch hand&s;ome lodgings! for &s;o long a time as you were at Mrs. Sinclair's?</P>
<P>Lord have mercy upon me! Mi&s;s Martin (I think you
<PB N="140" REF="141">
are Mi&s;s Martin)!&mdash;And is this the cau&s;e of &s;uch a di&s;|graceful in&s;ult upon me in the open &s;treets?</P>
<P>And cau&s;e enough, <HI>Mi&s;s Harlowe</HI> (fond of gratifying her jealous revenge, by calling her <HI>Mi&s;s</HI>)&mdash;One hundred and fifty guineas, or pounds, is no &s;mall &s;um to lo&s;e&mdash; And by a young creature, who would have bilked her lodgings!</P>
<P>You amaze me, Mi&s;s Martin!&mdash;What language do you talk in?&mdash;<HI>Bilk my lodgings!</HI>&mdash;What is that?</P>
<P>She &s;tood a&s;toni&s;hed, and &s;ilent for a few moments.</P>
<P>But recovering her&s;elf, and turning from her to the window, &s;he wrung her hands [The cur&s;ed Sally &s;hewed me how!]; and lifting them up&mdash;<HI>Now,</HI> Lovelace! Now indeed do I think I <HI>ought</HI> to forgive thee!&mdash;But who &s;hall forgive Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe!&mdash;O my &s;i&s;ter! O my brother! Tender mercies were your cruelties to <HI>this!</HI></P>
<P>After a pau&s;e, her handkerchief drying up her falling tears, &s;he turned to Sally! <HI>Now,</HI> have I nothing to do but acquie&s;ce &mdash; Only let me &s;ay, That if this aunt of yours, This Mrs. Sinclair; or This man, This Mr. Love|lace; come near me; or if I am carried to the horrid hou&s;e (for that I &s;uppo&s;e is to be the end of this new out|rage); God be merciful to the poor Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe!&mdash; Look to the con&s;equence!&mdash;Look, I charge you, to the con&s;equence!</P>
<P>The vile wretch told her, It was not de&s;igned to carry her any-whither again&s;t her will: But, if it were, they &s;hould take care not to be frighted again by a <HI>penknife.</HI></P>
<P>She ca&s;t up her eyes to heaven, and was &s;ilent&mdash;And went to the farthe&s;t corner of the room, and, &s;itting down, threw her handkerchief over her face.</P>
<P>Sally a&s;ked her &s;everal que&s;tions: But not an&s;wering her, &s;he told her, She would wait upon her by-and-by, when &s;he had found her &s;peech.</P>
<P>She ordered the people to pre&s;s her to eat and drink. She mu&s;t be fa&s;ting: Nothing but her prayers and tears, poor thing! were the mercile&s;s devil's words, as &s;he own|ed to me.&mdash;Do&s;t think I did not cur&s;e her?</P>
<P>She went away; and, after her own dinner, returned.</P>
<P>The unhappy lady, by this devil's account of her, then &s;eemed either mortified into meekne&s;s, or to have made a
<PB N="141" REF="142">
re&s;olution not to be provoked by the in&s;ults of this cur&s;ed creature.</P>
<P>Sally inquired, in her pre&s;ence, whether &s;he had eat or drank any-thing; and being told by the woman, that &s;he could not prevail upon her to ta&s;te a mor&s;el, or drink a drop, &s;he &s;aid, This is wrong, <HI>Mi&s;s Harlowe!</HI> Very wrong!&mdash;Your religion, I think, &s;hould teach you, that &s;tarving your&s;elf is &s;elf-murder.</P>
<P>She an&s;wered not.</P>
<P>The wretch owned, &s;he was re&s;olved to make her &s;peak.</P>
<P>She a&s;ked, If Mabell &s;hould attend her, till it were &s;een what her friends would do for her, in di&s;charge of the debt? Mabell, &s;aid &s;he, has not <HI>yet</HI> earned the cloaths you were &s;o good as to give her.</P>
<P>Am I not worth an an&s;wer, <HI>Mi&s;s Harlowe?</HI></P>
<P>I would an&s;wer you (&s;aid the &s;weet &s;ufferer, without any emotion), if I knew how.</P>
<P>I have ordered pen, ink, and paper, to be brought you, <HI>Mi&s;s Harlowe.</HI> There they are. I know you love write|ing. You may write to whom you plea&s;e. Your friend Mi&s;s Howe will expect to hear from you.</P>
<P>I have no friend, &s;aid &s;he. I de&s;erve none.</P>
<P>Rowland, for that is the officer's name, told her, She had friends enow to pay the debt, if &s;he would write.</P>
<P>She would trouble no-body; &s;he had no friends; was all they could get from her, while Sally &s;taid: But yet &s;poken with a patience of &s;pirit, as if &s;he enjoyed her griefs.</P>
<P>The in&s;olent creature went away, ordering them in her hearing to be very civil to her, and to let her want for nothing Now had &s;he, &s;he owned, the triumph of her heart over this haughty beauty, who kept them all at &s;uch a di&s;tance in their own hou&s;e!</P>
<P><HI>What thinke&s;t thou, Lovelace, of this!&mdash;This wretch's triumph was over a Clari&s;&s;a!</HI></P>
<P>About &s;ix in the evening, Rowland's wife pre&s;&s;ed her to drink tea. She &s;aid, She had rather have a gla&s;s of water; for her tongue was ready to cleave to the roof of her mouth.</P>
<P>The woman brought her a gla&s;s, and &s;ome bread and butter. She tried to ta&s;te the latter; but could not &s;wal|low
<PB N="142" REF="143">
it: But eagerly drank the water; lifting up her eyes in thankfulne&s;s for that!!!</P>
<P><HI>The divine Clari&s;&s;a, Lovelace &mdash; reduced to rejoice for a cup of cold water!&mdash;By</HI> whom <HI>reduced!</HI></P>
<P>About nine o'clock &s;he a&s;ked, If any-body were to be her bedfellow?</P>
<P>Their maid, if &s;he plea&s;ed; or, as &s;he was &s;o weak and ill, the girl &s;hould &s;it up with her, if &s;he cho&s;e &s;he &s;hould.</P>
<P>She cho&s;e to be alone, both night and day, &s;he &s;aid. But might &s;he not be tru&s;ted with the keys of the room where &s;he was to lie down; for &s;he &s;hould not put off her cloaths?</P>
<P>That, they told her, could not be.</P>
<P>She was afraid not, &s;he &s;aid.&mdash;But indeed &s;he would not get away, if &s;he could.</P>
<P>They told me, that they had but one bed, be&s;ides that they lay in them&s;elves; which they would fain have had her accept of; and be&s;ides <HI>that</HI> their maid lay in, in a garret, which they called, a hole of a garret: And that <HI>that</HI> one bed was the pri&s;oner's bed; which they made &s;everal apologies to me about. I &s;uppo&s;e it is &s;hocking enough.</P>
<P>But the lady would not lie in theirs. Was &s;he not a pri&s;oner, &s;he &s;aid?&mdash;Let her have the pri&s;oners room.</P>
<P>Yet they owned that &s;he &s;tarted, when &s;he was con|ducted thither. But recovering her&s;elf, Very well, &s;aid &s;he&mdash;Why &s;hould not all be of a piece?&mdash;Why &s;hould not my wretchedne&s;s be complete?</P>
<P>She found fault, that all the fa&s;tenings were on the out|&s;ide, and none within; and &s;aid, She could not tru&s;t her|&s;elf in a room, where others could come in at their plea|&s;ure, and &s;he not go out. She had not <HI>been u&s;ed</HI> to it!!!</P>
<P><HI>Dear, dear &s;oul!&mdash;My tears flow as I write. &mdash; Indeed, Lovelace, &s;he had not been u&s;ed to &s;uch treatment!</HI></P>
<P>They a&s;&s;ured her, that it was as much their duty to pro|tect her from other per&s;ons in&s;ults, as from e&s;caping her|&s;elf.</P>
<P>Then they were people of more honour, &s;he &s;aid, than &s;he had of late been u&s;ed to!</P>
<P>She a&s;ked, If they knew Mr. Lovelace?</P>
<P>No, was their an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Have you heard of him?</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="144">No.</P>
<P>Well then, you may be good &s;ort of folks in your way.</P>
<P><HI>Pau&s;e here a moment, Lovelace!&mdash;and reflect&mdash;I mu&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>AGAIN they a&s;ked her, If they &s;hould &s;end any word to her lodgings?</P>
<P>The&s;e are my lodgings now, are they not?&mdash;was all her an&s;wer.</P>
<P>She &s;at up in a chair all night, the back again&s;t the door; having, it &s;eems, thru&s;t a broken piece of a poker thro' the &s;taples where a bolt had been on the in&s;ide.</P>
<P>NEXT morning Sally and Polly both went to vi&s;it her.</P>
<P>She had begged of Sally the day before, that &s;he might not &s;ee Mrs. Sinclair, nor Dorcas, nor the broken-toothed &s;ervant, called William.</P>
<P>Polly would have ingratiated her&s;elf with her; and pretended to be concerned for her misfortunes. But &s;he took no more notice of her than of the other.</P>
<P>They a&s;ked, If &s;he had any commands?&mdash;If &s;he <HI>had,</HI> &s;he only need to mention what they were, and &s;he &s;hould be obeyed.</P>
<P>None at all, &s;he &s;aid.</P>
<P>How did &s;he like the people of the hou&s;e? Were they civil to her?</P>
<P>Pretty well, con&s;idering &s;he had no money to give them.</P>
<P>Would &s;he accept of any money? They could put it to her account.</P>
<P>She would contract no debts.</P>
<P>Had &s;he any money about her?</P>
<P>She meekly put her hand in her pocket, and pulled out half a guinea, and a little &s;ilver. Yes, I have a little.&mdash; But here &s;hould be fees paid, I believe. Should there not? I have heard of entrance-money to compound for not being &s;tript. But the&s;e people are very civil people, I fancy; for they have not offered to take away my cloaths.</P>
<P>They have <HI>orders</HI> to be civil to you.</P>
<P>It is very kind.</P>
<P>But we two will bail you, <HI>Mi&s;s,</HI> if you will go back with us to Mrs. Sinclair's.</P>
<P>Not for the world!</P>
<P>Hers are very hand&s;ome apartments.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="145">The fitter for tho&s;e who own them!</P>
<P>The&s;e are very &s;ad ones.</P>
<P>The fitter for <HI>me!</HI></P>
<P>You may be very happy yet, <HI>Mi&s;s,</HI> if you will.</P>
<P>I hope I &s;hall.</P>
<P>If you refu&s;e to eat or drink, we will give bail, and take you with us.</P>
<P>Then I will <HI>try</HI> to eat and drink. Any-thing but go with you.</P>
<P>Will you not &s;end to your new lodgings? The people will be frighted.</P>
<P>So they will, if I &s;end. So they will, if they know where I am.</P>
<P>But have you no things to &s;end for from thence?</P>
<P>There is what will pay for their lodgings and trouble: I &s;hall not le&s;&s;en their &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>But perhaps letters or me&s;&s;ages may be left for you there.</P>
<P>I have very few friends; and to tho&s;e I <HI>have,</HI> I will &s;pare the mortification of knowing what has befallen me.</P>
<P>We are &s;urpri&s;ed at your indifference, <HI>Mi&s;s</HI> Harlowe. Will you not write to any of your friends?</P>
<P>No.</P>
<P>Why, you don't think of tarrying <HI>here</HI> always?</P>
<P>I &s;hall not <HI>live</HI> always.</P>
<P>Do you think you are to &s;tay here, as long as you live?</P>
<P>That's as it &s;hall plea&s;e God, and tho&s;e who have brought me hither.</P>
<P>Should you like to be at liberty?</P>
<P>I am mi&s;erable!&mdash;What is liberty to the mi&s;erable, but to be <HI>more</HI> mi&s;erable!</P>
<P><HI>How,</HI> mi&s;erable, <HI>Mi&s;s?</HI> &mdash; You may make your&s;elf as happy as you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>I hope <HI>you</HI> are both happy.</P>
<P>We are.</P>
<P>May you be more and more happy!</P>
<P>But we wi&s;h <HI>you</HI> to be &s;o too.</P>
<P>I never &s;hall be of your opinion, I believe, as to what happine&s;s is.</P>
<P>What do you take our opinion of happine&s;s to be?</P>
<P>To live at Mrs. Sinclair's.</P>
<P>Perhaps, &s;aid Sally, we were once as &s;queami&s;h and narrow-minded as you.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="146">How came it over with you?</P>
<P>Becau&s;e we &s;aw the ridiculou&s;ne&s;s of prudery.</P>
<P>Do you come hither to per&s;uade me to hate prudery, as you call it, as much as you do?</P>
<P>We came to offer our &s;ervice to you.</P>
<P>It is out of your power to &s;erve me.</P>
<P>Perhaps not.</P>
<P>It is not in my inclination to trouble you.</P>
<P>You may be wor&s;e offered.</P>
<P>Perhaps I may.</P>
<P>You are mighty &s;hort, <HI>Mi&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>As I wi&s;h your vi&s;it to be, ladies.</P>
<P>They owned to me, that they cracked their fans, and laughed.</P>
<P>Adieu, perver&s;e Beauty!</P>
<P>Your &s;ervant, Ladies.</P>
<P>Adieu, Haughty-airs!</P>
<P>You &s;ee me humbled&mdash;</P>
<P>As you de&s;erve, <HI>Mi&s;s</HI> Harlowe. Pride will have a fall.</P>
<P>Better fall with what <HI>you</HI> call pride, than &s;tand with meanne&s;s.</P>
<P>Who does?</P>
<P>I had once a <HI>better</HI> opinion of <HI>you,</HI> Mi&s;s Horton!&mdash; Indeed you &s;hould not in&s;ult the mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>Neither &s;hould the <HI>mi&s;erable,</HI> &s;aid Sally, in&s;ult people for their civility.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be &s;orry if I did.</P>
<P>Mrs. Sinclair &s;hall attend you by-and-by, to know if you have any commands for <HI>her.</HI></P>
<P>I have no wi&s;h for any liberty, but that of refu&s;ing to &s;ee her, and <HI>one</HI> more per&s;on.</P>
<P>What we came for, was, to know if you had any pro|po&s;als to make for your inlargement?</P>
<P>Then, it &s;eems, the officer put in. You have very good friends, Madam, I under&s;tand. Is it not better that you make it up? Charges will run high. A hundred and fifty guineas are ea&s;ier paid than two hundred. Let the&s;e ladies bail you, and go along with them; or write to your friends to make it up.</P>
<P>Sally &s;aid, There is a gentleman who &s;aw you taken, and was &s;o much moved for you, <HI>Mi&s;s Harlowe,</HI> that he
<PB N="146" REF="147">
would gladly advance the money for you, and leave you to pay it when you can.</P>
<P>See, Lovelace, what cur&s;ed devils the&s;e are! This is the way, we know, that many an innocent heart is thrown upon keeping, and then upon the town. But for the&s;e wretches thus to go to work with &s;uch an angel as this!&mdash; How glad would have been the devili&s;h Sally, to have had the lea&s;t handle to report to thee a li&s;tening ear, or patient &s;pirit, upon this hint!</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid &s;he, with high indignation, to the officer, did not you &s;ay la&s;t night, that it was as much your bu&s;ine&s;s to protect me from the in&s;ults of others, as from e&s;caping?&mdash; Cannot I be permitted to &s;ee whom I plea&s;e; and to refu&s;e admittance to tho&s;e I like not?</P>
<P>Your creditors, Madam, will expect to &s;ee you.</P>
<P>Not, if I declare I will not treat with them.</P>
<P>Then, Madam, you will be &s;ent to pri&s;on.</P>
<P>Pri&s;on, friend!&mdash;What do&s;t thou call thy hou&s;e?</P>
<P>Not a pri&s;on, Madam.</P>
<P>Why the&s;e iron-barred windows then? Why the&s;e double locks, and bolts all on the out&s;ide, none on the In?</P>
<P>And down &s;he dropt into her chair, and they could not get another word from her. She threw her handkerchief over her face, as once before, which was &s;oon wet with tears; and grievou&s;ly, they own, &s;he &s;obbed.</P>
<P><HI>Gentle treatment, Lovelace! &mdash; Perhaps thou, as well as the&s;e wretches, wilt think it &s;o!</HI></P>
<P>Sally then ordered a dinner, and &s;aid, They would &s;oon be back again, and &s;ee that &s;he eat and drank, as a good Chri&s;tian &s;hould, comporting her&s;elf to her condition, and making the be&s;t of it.</P>
<P>What has not this charming creature &s;uffered; what has &s;he not gone thro' in the&s;e la&s;t three months, that I know of! &mdash; Who would think &s;uch a delicately-framed per&s;on could have &s;u&s;tained what &s;he has &s;u&s;tained? We &s;ome|times talk of bravery, of courage, of fortitude!&mdash;Here they are in perfection!&mdash;Such bravoes as Thou and I &s;hould never have been able to &s;upport our&s;elves under half the per&s;ecutions, the di&s;appointments, and contume|lies, that <HI>&s;he</HI> has met with; but, like cowards, &s;hould have &s;lid out of the world, ba&s;ely, by &s;ome back-door; that is
<PB N="147" REF="148">
to &s;ay, by a &s;word, by a pi&s;tol, by a halter, or knife!&mdash; But here is a fine-principled lady, who, by dint of this noble con&s;ideration, as I imagine (what el&s;e can &s;upport her?)&mdash;That &s;he has <HI>not de&s;erved the evils &s;he contends with;</HI> and that <HI>this world is de&s;igned but as a tran&s;itory &s;tate of probation;</HI> and that &s;he is <HI>traveling to another, and better;</HI> puts up with all the hard&s;hips of the <HI>journey;</HI> and is not to be diverted from her cour&s;e by the attacks of <HI>thieves</HI> and <HI>robbers,</HI> or any other terrors and difficul|ties; <HI>being a&s;&s;ured of an ample reward at the end of it!</HI></P>
<P>If thou thinke&s;t this reflection uncharacteri&s;tic, from a companion and friend of thine, imagine&s;t thou, that I pro&s;ited nothing by my attendance on my uncle for &s;o long a time, in his dying &s;tate; and from the pious re|flections of the good clergyman, who, day by day, at the poor man's own reque&s;t, vi&s;ited and prayed by him?&mdash; And could I have another &s;uch in&s;tance <HI>as this,</HI> to bring all the&s;e reflections home to me?</P>
<P>Then who can write of good per&s;ons, and of good &s;ub|jects, and be capable of <HI>admiring them,</HI> and not be made &s;erious for the <HI>time,</HI> if he write in character?&mdash;And hence may we gather, what a benefit to the morals of men the keeping of <HI>good</HI> company mu&s;t be; while tho&s;e who keep only <HI>bad,</HI> mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily more and more harden, and be hardened.</P>
<P>'TIS twelve of the clock, Sunday night &mdash; I can think of nothing but of this excellent creature. Her di&s;tre&s;&s;es fill my head and my heart. I was drow&s;y for a quarter of an hour; but the fit is gone off. And I will continue the melancholy &s;ubject from the information of the&s;e wretches. Enough, I dare &s;ay, will ari&s;e in the vi&s;it I &s;hall make, if admitted to-morrow, to &s;end by thy &s;ervant, as to the way I am likely to find her in.</P>
<P>After the women had left her, &s;he complained of her head and her heart; and &s;eemed terrified witth apprehen|&s;ions of being carried once more to Sinclair's.</P>
<P>Refu&s;ing any-thing for breakfa&s;t, Mrs. Rowland came up to her, and told her (as the&s;e wretches owned they had ordered her, for fear &s;he &s;hould &s;tarve her&s;elf), That &s;he <HI>mu&s;t</HI> and <HI>&s;hould</HI> have tea, and bread and butter&punc;
<PB N="148" REF="149">
And that, as &s;he had friends who could &s;upport her, if &s;he wrote to them, it was a wrong thing, both for her|&s;elf and <HI>them,</HI> to &s;tarve her&s;elf thus.</P>
<P>If it be for <HI>your own &s;akes,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, that is another thing: Let coffee, or tea, or chocolate, or what you will, be got: And put down a chicken to my account every day, if you plea&s;e, and eat it your&s;elves. I will ta&s;te it, if I can. I would do nothing to hinder you: I have friends will pay you liberally, when they know I am gone.</P>
<P>They wonder'd at her &s;trange compo&s;ure, in &s;uch di|&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>They were nothing, &s;he &s;aid, to what &s;he had &s;uffer'd already, from the vile&s;t of all men. The di&s;grace of &s;eizing her in the &s;treet; multitudes of people about her; &s;hocking imputations wounding her ears; had indeed been very affecting to her. But that was over.&mdash; Every thing &s;oon would! &mdash; And &s;he &s;hould be &s;till <HI>more</HI> com|po&s;ed, were it not for the apprehen&s;ions of &s;eeing one man, and one woman; and being tricked or forced back to the vile&s;t hou&s;e in the world.</P>
<P>Then were it not better to give way to the two gentle|womens offer to bail her?&mdash;They could tell her, it was a very kind proffer; and what was not be met with every day.</P>
<P>She believ'd &s;o.</P>
<P>The ladies might, po&s;&s;ibly, di&s;pen&s;e with her going back to the hou&s;e &s;he had &s;uch an antipathy to. Then the compa&s;&s;ionate gentleman, who was inclined to make it up with her creditors on her own bond, it was &s;trange to them &s;he hearkened not to &s;o generous a propo&s;al.</P>
<P>Did the two ladies tell you who the gentleman was?&mdash; Or, Did they &s;ay any more on that &s;ubject?</P>
<P>Yes, they did; and hinted to me, &s;aid the woman, that you had nothing to do, but to receive a vi&s;it from the gentleman, and the money, they believed, would be laid down on your own bond or note.</P>
<P>She was &s;tartled.</P>
<P>I charge you, &s;aid &s;he, as you will an&s;wer it one day to my friends, that you bring no gentleman into my com|pany. I charge you don't. If you do, you know not what may be the con&s;equence.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="150">They apprehended no bad con&s;equence, they &s;aid, in doing their duty: And if &s;he knew not her own good, her friends would thank them for taking any innocent &s;teps to &s;erve her, tho' again&s;t her will.</P>
<P>Don't pu&s;h me upon extremities, man! &mdash; Don't make me de&s;perate, woman!&mdash;I have no &s;mall difficulty, not|with&s;tanding the &s;eeming compo&s;ure you ju&s;t now took notice of, to bear, as I ought to bear, the evils I &s;uffer. But if you bring a man or men to me, be the pretence <HI>what</HI> it will &mdash;</P>
<P>She &s;topt there, and look'd &s;o earne&s;tly, and &s;o wildly, they &s;aid, that they did not know but &s;he would do &s;ome harm to her&s;elf, if they di&s;obeyed her; and that would be a &s;ad thing in <HI>their</HI> hou&s;e, and might be their ruin. So they promi&s;ed, that no man &s;hould be brought to her, but by her own con&s;ent.</P>
<P>Mrs. Rowland prevailed on her to drink a di&s;h of tea, and ta&s;te &s;ome bread and butter, about eleven on Saturday morning: Which &s;he probably did, to have an excu&s;e not to dine with the women, when they returned.</P>
<P>But &s;he would not quit her <HI>pri&s;on-room,</HI> as &s;he called it, to go into their parlour.</P>
<P><Q>Unbarred windows, and a light&s;omer apartment, &s;he &s;aid, had too chearful an appearance for her mind.</Q></P>
<P>At another time, <Q>The light of the &s;un was irk&s;ome to her. The &s;un &s;eemed to &s;hine in to mock her woes.</Q></P>
<P>And when, &s;oon after, a &s;hower fell, &s;he looked at it thro' the bars: <Q>How kindly, &s;aid &s;he, do the elements weep, to keep me company!</Q></P>
<P><Q>Methought, added &s;he, the &s;un darting in, a while ago, and gilding tho&s;e iron bars, played upon me, like the two women, who came to in&s;ult my haggard looks, by the word <HI>Beauty;</HI> and my dejected heart, with the word <HI>Haughty-airs!</HI></Q></P>
<P>Sally came again at dinner-time, <HI>to &s;ee how &s;he fared,</HI> as &s;he told her; and that &s;he did not &s;tarve her&s;elf: And, as &s;he wanted to have &s;ome talk with her, if &s;he gave her leave, &s;he would dine with her.</P>
<P>I cannot eat.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t try, <HI>Mi&s;s Harlowe.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="151">And, dinner being ready ju&s;t then, &s;he offered her hand, and de&s;ired her to walk down.</P>
<P>No; &s;he would not &s;tir out of her <HI>pri&s;on-room.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ullen airs won't do, <HI>Mi&s;s Harlowe:</HI> Indeed they won't.</P>
<P>She was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>You will have harder u&s;age than any you have ever yet known, I can tell you, if you come not into &s;ome hu|mour to make matters up.</P>
<P>She was &s;till &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Come, <HI>Mi&s;s,</HI> walk down to dinner. Let me intreat you, do. Mi&s;s Horton is below: She was once your favourite.</P>
<P>She waited for an an&s;wer: But received none.</P>
<P>We came to make &s;ome propo&s;als to you, for your good; tho' you affronted us &s;o lately. And we would not let Mrs. Sinclair come in per&s;on, becau&s;e we thought to oblige you.</P>
<P>That is indeed obliging.</P>
<P>Come, give me your hand, <HI>Mi&s;s Harlowe:</HI> You <HI>are</HI> obliged to me, I can tell you That: And let us go down to Mi&s;s Horton.</P>
<P>Excu&s;e me: I will not &s;tir out of this room.</P>
<P>Would you have me and Mi&s;s Horton dine in this filthy bed-room?</P>
<P>It is not a bed-room to me. I have not been in bed; nor will, while I am here.</P>
<P>And yet you care not, as I &s;ee, to leave the hou&s;e.&mdash; And &s;o you won't go down, <HI>Mi&s;s Harlowe?</HI></P>
<P>I won't, except I am forced to it.</P>
<P>Well, well, let it alone. I &s;ha'n't a&s;k Mi&s;s Horton to dine in this room, I a&s;&s;ure you. I will &s;end up a plate.</P>
<P><HI>And away the little &s;aucy toad fluttered down.</HI></P>
<P>And when they had dined, up they came together.</P>
<P>Well, Mi&s;s, you would not eat any thing, it &s;eems!&mdash; Very pretty &s;ullen airs the&s;e!&mdash;No wonder <HI>the hone&s;t gen|tleman had &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h a hand with you.</HI></P>
<P>She only held up her hands and eyes; the tears trick|ling down her cheeks.</P>
<P><HI>In&s;olent devils!&mdash;How much more cruel and in&s;ulting are bad women, even than bad men!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="152">Methinks, <HI>Mi&s;s,</HI> &s;aid Sally, you are a little <HI>&s;oily,</HI> to what we have &s;een you. Pity &s;uch a nice lady &s;hould not have changes of apparel. Why won't you &s;end to your lodgings for linen, at lea&s;t?</P>
<P>I am not nice now.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s looks well and clean in any thing, &s;aid Polly. But, dear Madam, why won't you &s;end to your lodgings? It is but kind to the <HI>people.</HI> They mu&s;t have a concern about you. And your Mi&s;s Howe will wonder what's be|come of you; for, no doubt, you corre&s;pond.</P>
<P>She turned from them, and, to her&s;elf, &s;aid, <HI>Too much! Too much!</HI>&mdash;She to&s;&s;ed her handkerchief, wet before with her tears, from her, and held her apron to her eyes.</P>
<P>Don't weep, Mi&s;s! &s;aid the vile Polly.</P>
<P>Yet <HI>do,</HI> cry'd the viler Sally, if it be a relief. Nothing, as Mr. Lovelace once told <HI>me,</HI> dries &s;ooner than tears. For once I too wept mightily.</P>
<P>I could not bear the recital of this with patience. Yet I cur&s;ed them not &s;o much as I &s;hould have done, had I not had a mind to get from them all the particulars of their <HI>gentle</HI> treatment; and this for two rea&s;ons; the one, that I might &s;tab thee to the heart with the repetition; the other, that I might know upon what terms I am likely to &s;ee the unhappy lady to-morrow.</P>
<P>Well, but, <HI>Mi&s;s Harlowe,</HI> cry'd Sally, do you think the&s;e <HI>forlorn airs</HI> pretty? You are a good Chri&s;tian, child. Mrs. Rowland tells me, &s;he has got you a Bible-book&mdash; O there it lies!&mdash;I make no doubt, but you have doubled down the <HI>u&s;eful places,</HI> as hone&s;t Matt. Prior &s;ays.</P>
<P>Then ri&s;ing, and taking it up&mdash;Ay, &s;o you have&mdash;The <HI>Book of Job!</HI> One opens naturally here, I &s;ee&mdash;<HI>My</HI> mam|ma made me a fine bible-&s;cholar.&mdash;<HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;ticus</HI> too!&mdash; That's Apocrypha, as they call it&mdash;You &s;ee, Mi&s;s Hor|ton, I know &s;omething of the book.</P>
<P>They propo&s;ed once more to bail her, and to go home with them. A motion which &s;he received with the &s;ame indignation as before.</P>
<P>Sally told her, That &s;he had written in a very favour|able manner, in her behalf, to you; and that &s;he every hour expected an an&s;wer; and made no doubt, that you
<PB N="152" REF="153">
would come up with the me&s;&s;enger, and generou&s;ly pay the whole debt, and a&s;k her pardon for neglecting it.</P>
<P>This di&s;turbed her &s;o much, that they feared &s;he would have fallen into fits. She could not bear your name, &s;he &s;aid. She hoped, &s;he &s;hould never &s;ee you more: And were you to intrude your&s;elf, dreadful con&s;equences might follow.</P>
<P>Surely, they &s;aid, &s;he would be glad to be relea&s;ed from her confinement.</P>
<P>Indeed &s;he <HI>&s;hould,</HI> now they had begun to alarm her with <HI>his</HI> name, who was the author of all her woes: And who, &s;he now &s;aw plainly, gave way to this new outrage, in order to bring her to his own infamous terms.</P>
<P>Why then, they a&s;ked, would &s;he not write to her friends, to pay Mrs. Sinclair's demand?</P>
<P>Becau&s;e &s;he hoped &s;he &s;hould not long trouble any|body; and becau&s;e &s;he knew, that the payment of the money, if &s;he were able to pay it, was not what was aim|ed at.</P>
<P>Sally owned, that &s;he told her, That, truly, &s;he had thought her&s;elf as well de&s;cended and as well educated as her&s;elf, tho' not intitled to &s;uch con&s;iderable fortunes. And had the impudence to in&s;i&s;t upon it to me to be truth.</P>
<P>She had the in&s;olence to add, to the lady, That &s;he had as much rea&s;on as <HI>&s;he,</HI> to expect Mr. Lovelace would mar|ry her; he having contracted to do &s;o <HI>before</HI> he knew Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe: And that &s;he had it under his hand and &s;eal too&mdash;or el&s;e he had not obtained his end: Therefore, it was not likely &s;he &s;hould be &s;o officious as to do his work again&s;t her&s;elf, if &s;he thought Mr. Lovelace had de|&s;igns upon her, like what &s;he <HI>pre&s;umed</HI> to hint at: That, for her part, her only view was, to procure liberty to a young gentlewoman, who made tho&s;e things grievous to her, which would not be made &s;uch a rout about by any|body el&s;e &mdash; and to procure the payment of a ju&s;t debt to her friend Mrs. Sinclair.</P>
<P>She be&s;ought them to leave her. She wanted not the&s;e in&s;tances, &s;he &s;aid, to convince her of the company &s;he was in: And told them, that, to get rid of &s;uch vi&s;itors, and of &s;till wor&s;e that &s;he apprehended, &s;he would write
<PB N="153" REF="154">
to one friend to rai&s;e the money for her; tho' it would be death for her to do &s;o; becau&s;e that friend could not do it without her mother, in who&s;e eye it would give a &s;elfi&s;h appearance to a friend&s;hip, that was above all &s;ordid alloys.</P>
<P>They advi&s;ed her to write out of hand.</P>
<P>But how much mu&s;t I write for? What is the &s;um? Should I not have had a bill delivered me?&mdash;God knows, I took not your lodgings. But he that could treat me, as he has done, could do this!</P>
<P>Don't &s;peak again&s;t Mr. Lovelace, <HI>Mi&s;s Harlowe.</HI> He is a man I greatly e&s;teem [Cur&s;ed toad!]. And, 'bating that he will take his advantage, where he can, of <HI>Us</HI> &s;illy credulous girls, he is a man of honour.</P>
<P>She lifted up her hands and eyes, in&s;tead of &s;peaking&punc; And well &s;he might! For any words &s;he could have u&s;ed, could not have expre&s;&s;ed the angui&s;h &s;he mu&s;t feel, on be|ing comprehended in the US.</P>
<P>She mu&s;t write for one hundred and fifty guineas, at lea&s;t: Two hundred, if &s;he were &s;hort of money, might as well be written for.</P>
<P>Mrs. Sinclair, &s;he &s;aid, had all her cloaths. Let them be &s;old, <HI>fairly</HI> &s;old, and the money go as far as it would go. She had al&s;o a few other valuables; but no money (none at all), but the poor half-guinea, and the little &s;il|ver they had &s;een. She would give bond to pay all that her apparel, and the other matters &s;he had, would fall &s;hort of. She had great effects belonging to her of right. Her bond would, and mu&s;t, be paid, were it for a thou|&s;and pounds. But her cloaths &s;he &s;hould never want. She believed, if not too much undervalued, tho&s;e, and her few valuables, would an&s;wer every-thing. She wi&s;hed for no &s;urplus, but to di&s;charge the la&s;t expences; and forty &s;hillings would do as well for tho&s;e, as forty pounds. Let my ruin, &s;aid &s;he, lifting up her eyes, be LARGE, be COMPLETE, <HI>in this life!</HI>&mdash;For a <HI>compo&s;ition,</HI> let it be COM|PLETE &mdash; And there &s;he &s;topped. No doubt alluding to her father's futurely-extended cur&s;e!</P>
<P>The wretches could not help wi&s;hing to me for the op|portunity of making &s;uch a purchace for their own wear. How I cur&s;ed <HI>them!</HI> and, in my heart, <HI>thee!</HI>&mdash;But too probable, thought I, that this vile Sally Martin may hope
<PB N="154" REF="155">
[Tho' thou art incapable of it], that <HI>her</HI> Lovelace, as &s;he has the a&s;&s;urance, behind thy back, to call thee, may pre|&s;ent her with &s;ome of the poor lady's &s;poils!</P>
<P>Will not Mrs. Sinclair, proceeded &s;he, think my cloaths a &s;ecurity, till they can be &s;old? They are very good cloaths. A &s;uit or two but ju&s;t put on, as it were; never worn. They co&s;t much more than is demanded of me. <HI>My father loved to &s;ee me fine.</HI>&mdash;All &s;hall go. But let me have the particulars of her demand. I &s;uppo&s;e I mu&s;t pay for my <HI>de&s;troyer</HI> (that was her well-adapted word!), and his &s;ervants, as well as for my&s;elf.&mdash;I am content to do &s;o &mdash; Indeed I am content to do &s;o &mdash; I am above wi&s;hing, that any-body, who could <HI>thus</HI> act, &s;hould be &s;o much as expo&s;tulated with, as to the ju&s;tice and equity of it. If I have but enough to pay the demand, I &s;hall be &s;atisfied; and will leave the ba&s;ene&s;s of &s;uch an action as this, as an aggravation of a guilt, which I thought could <HI>not</HI> be aggravated.</P>
<P>I own, Lovelace, I have malice in this particularity, in order to &s;ting thee to the heart. And, let me a&s;k thee, What now thou can&s;t think of thy barbarity, thy unprece|dented barbarity, in having reduced a per&s;on of her rank, fortune, talents, and virtue, &s;o low?</P>
<P>The wretched women, it mu&s;t be owned, act but in their profe&s;&s;ion; a profe&s;&s;ion thou ha&s;t been the principal means of reducing the&s;e two to act in. And they know what thy de&s;igns have been, and how far pro&s;ecuted. It is, in their opinions, u&s;ing her <HI>gently,</HI> that they have for|born to bring to her the woman &s;o ju&s;tly odious to her; and that they have not threatened her with the introducing to her &s;trange men: Nor yet brought into her company their <HI>&s;pirit-breakers,</HI> and <HI>humbling-drones</HI> (fellows not allowed to carry &s;tings), to trace and force her back to their dete&s;ted hou&s;e; and, when there, into all their mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>Till I came, they thought thou would&s;t not be di&s;|plea&s;ed at any-thing &s;he &s;uffered, that could help to mor|tify her into a &s;tate of &s;hame and di&s;grace; and bring her to comply with thy views, when thou &s;hould&s;t come to relea&s;e her from the&s;e wretches, as from a greater evil than cohabiting with thee.</P>
<P>When thou con&s;idere&s;t the&s;e things, thou wilt make no

difficulty of believing, that this their own account of their behaviour to this admirable lady, has been far &s;hort of their in&s;ults: And the le&s;s, when I tell thee, that, all to|gether, their u&s;age had &s;uch effects upon her, that they left her in violent hy&s;terics; ordering an apothecary to be &s;ent for, if &s;he &s;hould continue in them, and be wor&s;e; and particularly (as they had done from the fir&s;t) that they kept out of her way any edged or pointed in&s;trument; e&s;pecially a penknife; which, pretending to mend a pen, they &s;aid, &s;he might a&s;k for.</P>
<P>At twelve Saturday night, Rowland &s;ent to tell them, that &s;he was &s;o ill, that he knew not what might be the i&s;&s;ue; and wi&s;hed her out of his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>And this made them as heartily wi&s;h to hear from you. For their me&s;&s;enger, to their great &s;urprize, was not then returned from M. Hall. And they were &s;ure he mu&s;t have reached that place by Friday night.</P>
<P>Early on Sunday morning, both devils went to &s;ee how &s;he did. They had &s;uch an account of her weakne&s;s, lowne&s;s, and angui&s;h, that they forbore, out of compa&s;|&s;ion, they &s;aid, finding their vi&s;its &s;o di&s;agreeable to her, to &s;ee her. But their apprehen&s;ion of what might be the i&s;&s;ue was, no doubt, their principal con&s;ideration: No|thing el&s;e could have &s;oftened &s;uch flinty bo&s;oms.</P>
<P>They &s;ent for the apothecary Rowland had had to her, and gave him, and Roland, and his wife, and maid, paradeful injunctions for the utmo&s;t care to be taken of her: No doubt, with an Old-Bailey foreca&s;t. And they &s;ent up to let her know what orders they had given: But that, under&s;tanding &s;he had taken &s;omething to compo&s;e her&s;elf, they would not di&s;turb her.</P>
<P>She had &s;crupled, it &s;eems, to admit the apothecary's vi&s;it over-night, becau&s;e he was a MAN:&mdash;And could not be prevailed upon, till they pleaded <HI>their own &s;afety</HI> to her.</P>
<P>They went again, from church &mdash; Lord, Bob, the&s;e creatures go to church! &mdash; But &s;he &s;ent them down word, that &s;he mu&s;t have all the remainder of the day to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>When I fir&s;t came, and told them of thy execrations for what they had done, and joined my own to them, they were a&s;toni&s;hed. The mother &s;aid, &s;he had thought &s;he had known Mr. Lovelace better; and expected thanks, and not cur&s;es.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Monday, July</HI> 17.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>ABOUT &s;ix this morning I went to Rowland's. Mrs. Sinclair was to follow me, in order to di&s;mi&s;s the action; but not to come in &s;ight.</P>
<P>Rowland, upon inquiry, told me, that the lady was extremely ill; and that &s;he had de&s;ired, not to let any|body but his wife or maid come near her.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="158">I &s;aid, I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> &s;ee her. I had told him my bu&s;ine&s;s over-night; and I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> &s;ee her.</P>
<P>His wife went up: But returned pre&s;ently, &s;aying, She could not get her to &s;peak to her; yet that her eye-lids moved; tho' &s;he either would not, or could not, open them, to look up at her.</P>
<P>Oons, woman, &s;aid I, the lady may be in a fit: The lady may be dying.&mdash;Let me go up. Shew me the way.</P>
<P>A horrid hole of a hou&s;e, in a alley they call a court; &s;tairs wretchedly narrow, even to the fir&s;t-floor rooms: And into a den they led me, with broken walls, which had been papered, as I &s;aw by a multitude of tacks, and &s;ome torn bits held on by the ru&s;ty heads.</P>
<P>The floor indeed was clean, but the ceiling was &s;moked with variety of figures, and initials of names, that had been the woful employment of wretches, who had no other way to amu&s;e them&s;elves.</P>
<P>A bed at one corner, with coar&s;e curtains tacked up at the feet to the ceiling; becau&s;e the curtain rings were broken off; but a coverlid upon it with a cleani&s;h look, tho' plaguily in tatters, and the corners tied up in ta&s;&s;els, that the rents in it might go no farther.</P>
<P>The windows dark and double-barred, the tops boarded up to &s;ave mending; and only a little four-paned eylet-hole of a ca&s;ement to let in air; more, however, coming in at broken panes, than could come in at That.</P>
<P>Four old turkey-worked chairs, bur&s;ten-bottomed, the &s;tuffing &s;taring out.</P>
<P>An old, tottering, worm-eaten table, that had more nails be&s;towed in mending it to make it &s;tand, than the table co&s;t fifty years ago, when new.</P>
<P>On the mantle-piece was an iron &s;hove-up candle&s;tick, with a lighted candle in it, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, four of them, I &s;uppo&s;e, for a peny.</P>
<P>Near that, on the &s;ame &s;helf, was an old looking-gla&s;s, cracked thro' the middle, breaking out into a thou&s;and points; the crack given it, perhaps, in a rage, by &s;ome poor creature, to whom it gave the repre&s;entation of his heart's woes in his face.</P>
<P>The chimney had two half-tiles in it on one &s;ide, and one whole one on the other; which &s;hewed it had been in
<PB N="158" REF="159">
better plight; but now the very morter had followed the re&s;t of the tiles, in every other place, and left the bricks bare.</P>
<P>An old half-barred &s;tove-grate was in the chimney; and in that a large &s;tone-bottle without a neck, filled with baleful eugh, as an ever-green, withered &s;outhern-wood, and &s;weet-briar, and &s;prigs of rue in flower.</P>
<P>To fini&s;h the &s;hocking de&s;cription, in a dark nook &s;tood an old, broken-bottomed cane couch, without a &s;quab, or coverlid, &s;unk at one corner, and unmorti&s;ed, by the failing of one of its worm-eaten legs, which lay in two pieces under the wretched piece of furniture it could no longer &s;upport.</P>
<P><HI>And This, thou horrid Lovelace, was the bedchamber of the divine Clari&s;&s;a!!!</HI></P>
<P>I had lei&s;ure to ca&s;t my eye on the&s;e things: For, going up &s;oftly, the poor lady turned not about at our entrance; nor, till I &s;poke, moved her head.</P>
<P>She was kneeling in a corner of the room, near the di&s;mal window, again&s;t the table, on an old bol&s;ter, as it &s;eemed to be, of the cane couch, half-covered with her handkerchief; her back to the door; which was only &s;hut to (No need of fa&s;tenings!); her arms cro&s;&s;ed upon the table, the fore-finger of her right-hand in her bible. She had perhaps been reading in it, and could read no longer. Paper, pens, ink, lay by her book, on the table. Her dre&s;s was white dama&s;k, exceeding neat; but her &s;tays &s;eemed not tight-laced. I was told afterwards, that her laces had been cut, when &s;he fainted away at her entrance into this cur&s;ed place; and &s;he had not been &s;olicitous enough about her dre&s;s, to &s;end for others. Her head|dre&s;s was a little di&s;compo&s;ed; her charming hair, in na|tural ringlets, as you have heretofore de&s;cribed it, but a little tangled, as if not lately kembed, irregularly &s;hading one &s;ide of the lovelie&s;t neck in the world; as her di&s;or|dered, rumpled handkerchief did the other. Her face [O how altered from what I had &s;een it! Yet lovely in &s;pite of all her griefs and &s;ufferings!] was reclined, when we entered, upon her cro&s;&s;ed arms; but &s;o, as not more than one &s;ide of it to be hid.</P>
<P>When I &s;urveyed the room around, and the kneeling
<PB N="159" REF="160">
lady, &s;unk with maje&s;ty too in her-white, flowing robes [for &s;he had not on a hoop], &s;preading the dark, tho' not dirty, floor, and illuminating that horrid corner; her linen beyond imagination white, con&s;idering that &s;he had not been undre&s;&s;ed ever &s;ince &s;he had been here; I thought my concern would have choaked me. Something ro&s;e in my throat, I know not what, which made me, for a moment, guggle, as it were, for &s;peech: Which, at la&s;t, forcing its way, Con&mdash;Con&mdash;Confound you both, &s;aid I to the man and woman, is this an apartment for &s;uch a lady? And could the cur&s;ed devils of her own &s;ex, who vi&s;ited this &s;uffering angel, &s;ee her, and leave her, in &s;o damned a nook?</P>
<P>Sir, we would have had the lady to accept of our own bedchamber; but &s;he refu&s;ed it. We are poor people&mdash; And we expect no-body will &s;tay with us longer than they can help it.</P>
<P>You are people cho&s;en purpo&s;ely, I doubt not, by the damned woman who has employed you: And if your u&s;age of this lady has been but half as bad as your hou&s;e, you had better never to have &s;een the light.</P>
<P>Up then rai&s;ed the charming &s;ufferer her lovely face; but with &s;uch a &s;ignificance of woe over&s;preading it, that I could not, for the &s;oul of me, help being vi&s;ibly affected.</P>
<P>She waved her hand two or three times towards the door, as if commanding me to withdraw; and di&s;plea&s;ed at my intru&s;ion; but did not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">peak.</P>
<P>Permit me, Madam&mdash;I will not approach one &s;tep farther without your leave &mdash; Permit me, for one moment, the favour of your ear!</P>
<P>No&mdash;No&mdash;Go, go; MAN, with an empha&s;is&mdash;And would have &s;aid more; but, as if &s;truggling in vain for words, &s;he &s;eemed to give up &s;peech for lo&s;t, and dropp'd her head down once more, with a deep &s;igh, upon her left arm; her right, as if &s;he had not the u&s;e of it (numb|ed, I &s;uppo&s;e), &s;elf-moved, dropping down on her &s;ide.</P>
<P>O that thou had&s;t been there! and in my place!&mdash;But by what I then felt, in my&s;elf, I am convinced, that a capacity of being moved by the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of our fellow-creatures, is far from being di&s;graceful to a manly heart. With what plea&s;ure, at that moment, could I have given up my own life, could I but fir&s;t have avenged this charm|ing

creature, and cut the throat of her <HI>de&s;troyer,</HI> as &s;he emphatically calls thee, tho' the friend that I be&s;t love! And yet, at the &s;ame time, my heart and my eyes gave way to a &s;oftne&s;s, of which (tho' not &s;o hardened a wretch as thou) it was never before &s;o &s;u&s;ceptible.</P>
<P>I dare not approach you, deare&s;t Lady, without your leave: But on my knees I be&s;eech you to permit me to relea&s;e you from this damned hou&s;e, and out of the power of the accur&s;ed woman, who was the occa&s;ion of your being here!</P>
<P>She lifted up her &s;weet face once more, and beheld me on my knees. Never knew I before what it was to pray &s;o heartily.</P>
<P>Are you not&mdash;Are you not Mr. Belford, Sir? I think your name is Belford?</P>
<P>It is, Madam, and I ever was a wor&s;hiper of your virtues, and an advocate for you; and I come to relea&s;e you from the hands you are in.</P>
<P>And in who&s;e to place me? O leave me, leave me! Let me never ri&s;e from this &s;pot! Let me never, never more believe in man!</P>
<P>This moment, deare&s;t Lady, this very moment, if you plea&s;e, you may depart whither&s;oever you think fit. You are ab&s;olutely free, and your own mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>I had now as lieve die here in this place, as any-where. I will owe no obligation to any friend of <HI>him</HI> in who&s;e company you have &s;een me. So, pray, Sir, withdraw.</P>
<P>Then turning to the officer, Mr. Rowland I think your name is? I am better reconciled to your hou&s;e than I was at fir&s;t. If you can but engage, that I &s;hall have no-body come near me but your wife; no <HI>Man!</HI> and neither of tho&s;e women, who have &s;ported with my calamities; I will die with you, and in this very corner. And you &s;hall be well &s;atisfied for the trouble you have had with me.&mdash; I have value enough for that&mdash;for, &s;ee, I have a diamond ring; taking it out of her bo&s;om; and I have friends will redeem it at a high price, when I am gone.</P>
<P>But for <HI>you,</HI> Sir, looking at me, I beg you to with|draw. If you mean me well, God, I hope, will reward you for your good meaning; but to the friend of my <HI>de|&s;troyer</HI> will I not owe an obligation.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="162">You will owe no obligation to me, nor to any-body. You have been detained for a debt you do not owe.

And I will either leave you at the coach-door, or attend you whither&s;oever you plea&s;e, till I &s;ee you &s;afe where you would wi&s;h to be.</P>
<P>Will you then, Sir, <HI>compel</HI> me to be beholden to you?</P>
<P>You will inexpre&s;&s;ibly oblige me, Madam, to com|mand me to do you either &s;ervice or plea&s;ure.</P>

If I want to &s;ay any-thing more to you (you &s;eem to be an humane man), I will let you know:&mdash;And &s;o, Sir, God ble&s;s you.</P>
<P>I approached her, and was going to &s;peak&mdash;</P>

<P>Why, Lovelace, wa&s;t thou not pre&s;ent thy&s;elf?&mdash;Why do&s;t thou commit &s;uch villainies, as even thou thy&s;elf art afraid to appear in; and yet putte&s;t a weaker heart and head upon encountering with?</P>
<P>The maid coming in ju&s;t then, the woman and &s;he lifted her up, on the decrepit couch; and I withdrew with this Rowland; who wept like a child, and &s;aid, he never in his life was &s;o moved.</P>
<P><HI>Yet &s;o hardened a wretch art thou, that I que&s;tion whe|ther thou wilt &s;hed a tear at my relation.</HI></P>
<P>They recovered her by harts-horn and water: I went down mean while; for the dete&s;table woman had been below &s;ome time. O how did I cur&s;e her! I never before was &s;o fluent in cur&s;es.</P>
<P>She tried to wheedle me; but I renounced her; and, after &s;he had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the action, &s;ent her away crying, or pretending to cry, becau&s;e of my behaviour to her.</P>
<P>You will ob&s;erve, that I did not mention one word to the lady about <HI>you.</HI> I was afraid to do it. For 'twas plain, that &s;he could not bear your name: Your <HI>friend,</HI> and the <HI>company</HI> you have &s;een me in, were the words neare&s;t to naming you, &s;he could &s;peak: And yet I wanted to clear your intention of this brutal, this &s;ordid-looking, villainy.</P>
<P>I &s;ent up again, by Rowland's wife, when I heard that the lady was recovered, be&s;eeching her to quit that devili&s;h place; and the woman a&s;&s;ured her, that &s;he was at full liberty to do &s;o; for that the action was di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>But &s;he cared not to an&s;wer her: And was &s;o weak and low, that it was almo&s;t as much out of her power as incli|nation, the woman told me, to &s;peak.</P>
<P>I would have ha&s;tened away for my friend doctor H. but the hou&s;e is &s;uch a den, and the room &s;he was in &s;uch a hole, that I was a&s;hamed to be &s;een in it by a man of his reputation, e&s;pecially with a woman of &s;uch an appear|ance, and in &s;uch uncommon di&s;tre&s;s; and I found there
<PB N="163" REF="164">
was no prevailing on her to quit it for the peoples bed|room, which was neat and light&s;ome.</P>
<P>The &s;trong room, &s;he was in, the wretches told me, &s;hould have been in better order, but that it was but the very morning that &s;he was brought in, that an unhappy man had quitted it; for a more eligible pri&s;on, no doubt; &s;ince there could hardly be a wor&s;e.</P>
<P>Being told, that &s;he de&s;ired not to be di&s;turbed, and &s;eemed inclined to do&s;e, I took this opportunity to go to her lodgings in Covent-garden; to which Dorcas (who fir&s;t di&s;covered her there, as Will. was the &s;etter from church) had before given me a direction.</P>
<P>The man's name is Smith, a dealer in gloves, &s;nuff, and &s;uch petty merchandize: His wife the &s;hopkeeper: He a maker of the gloves they &s;ell. Hone&s;t people, it &s;eems.</P>
<P>I thought to have got the woman with me to the lady; but &s;he was not within.</P>
<P>I talked with the man, and told him what had befallen the lady; owing, as I &s;aid, to a mi&s;take of orders; and gave her the character &s;he de&s;erved; and de&s;ired him to &s;end his wife, the moment &s;he came in, to the lady; di|recting him whither; not doubting, that her attendance would be very welcome to her: Which he promi&s;ed.</P>
<P>He told me, that a letter was left for her there on Sa|turday; and, about half an hour before I came, another, &s;uper&s;cribed by the &s;ame hand; the fir&s;t, by the po&s;t; the other, by a countryman; who, having been informed of her ab&s;ence, and of all the circum&s;tances they could tell him of it, po&s;ted away, full of concern, &s;aying, that the lady he was &s;ent from would be ready to break her heart at the tidings.</P>
<P>I thought it right to take the two letters back with me; and, di&s;mi&s;&s;ing my coach, took a chair, as a more proper vehicle for the lady, if I (the friend of her <HI>de&s;troyer</HI>) could prevail upon her to leave Rowland's.</P>
<P>And here being obliged to give way to an indi&s;pen&s;able avocation, I will make thee ta&s;te a little in thy turn, of the plague of &s;u&s;pen&s;e; and break off, without giving thee the lea&s;t hint of the i&s;&s;ue of my further proceedings.

<HEAD>LETTER XLIII. <HI>Mr.</HI> BELFORD, <HI>To</HI> ROBERT LOVELACE, <ABBR><HI>E&s;q</HI></ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Monday-night, July</HI> 17.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON my return to Rowland's, I found that the apo|thecary was ju&s;t gone up. Mrs. Rowland being above with him, I made the le&s;s &s;cruple to go up too, as it was probable, that to a&s;k for leave would be to a&s;k to be denied; hoping al&s;o, that the letters I had with me would be a good excu&s;e.</P>
<P>She was &s;itting on the &s;ide of the broken couch, ex|tremely weak and low; and, I ob&s;erved, cared not to &s;peak to the man; and no wonder; for I never &s;aw a more &s;hocking fellow, of a profe&s;&s;ion tolerably genteel, nor heard a more illiterate one prate&mdash;Phy&s;ician in ordinary to this hou&s;e, and others like it, I &s;uppo&s;e! He put me in mind of Otway's apothecary in his Caius Marius:
<Q><L>Meagre and very rueful were his looks:</L>
<L>Sharp mi&s;ery had worn him to the bones.</L>
<L>&mdash; Famine in his cheeks:</L>
<L>Need and oppre&s;&s;ion &s;taring in his eyes:</L>
<L>Contempt and beggary hanging on his back:</L>
<L>The world no friend of his, nor the world's law.</L></Q></P>
<P>As I am in black, he took me at my entrance, I believe, to be a doctor, and &s;lunk behind me with his hat upon his two thumbs, and looked as if he expected the oracle to open, and give him orders.</P>
<P>The lady looked di&s;plea&s;ed, as well at me as at Row|land, who followed me, and at the apothecary. It was not, &s;he &s;aid, the lea&s;t of her pre&s;ent misfortunes, that &s;he could not be left to her own &s;ex; and to her option to &s;ee whom &s;he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>I be&s;ought her excu&s;e; and, winking for the apothe|cary to withdraw (which he did), told her, that I had been at her new lodgings, to order every-thing to be got
<PB N="166" REF="167">
ready for her reception; pre&s;uming &s;he would choo&s;e to go thither: That I had a chair at the door: That Mr. Smith, and his wife [I named their names, that &s;he &s;hould not have room for the lea&s;t fear of Sinclair's], had been full of apprehen&s;ions for her &s;afety: That I had brought two letters, which were left there for her; one by the po&s;t, the other that very morning.</P>
<P>This took her attention. She held out her charming hand for them; took them, and, pre&s;&s;ing them to her lips&mdash;From the only friend I have in the world! &s;aid &s;he, ki&s;&s;ing them again; and looking at the &s;eals, as if to &s;ee whether they had been opened. I can't read them, &s;aid &s;he, my eyes are too dim; and put them in her bo&s;om.</P>
<P>I be&s;ought her to think of quitting that wretched hole.</P>
<P>Where could &s;he go, &s;he a&s;ked, to be &s;afe and uninter|rupted for the &s;hort remainder of her life; and to avoid being again vi&s;ited by the creatures who had in&s;ulted her before?</P>
<P>I gave her the &s;olemne&s;t a&s;&s;urances, that &s;he &s;hould not be invaded in her new lodgings by any-body; and &s;aid, that I would particularly engage my honour, that <HI>the per&s;on who had mo&s;t offended her &s;hould not come near her, without her own con&s;ent.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Your</HI> honour, Sir! Are you not that man's friend?</P>
<P>I am not a friend, Madam, to his vile actions to the <HI>mo&s;t excellent of women.</HI></P>
<P>Do you flatter me, Sir? Then are you a MAN.&mdash;But Oh, Sir, your friend, holding her face forward with great earne&s;tne&s;s, your <HI>barbarous</HI> friend, what has he not to an&s;wer for!</P>
<P>There &s;he &s;topt: Her heart full; and putting her hand over her eyes and forehead, the tears trickled thro' her fingers: Re&s;enting thy barbarity, it &s;eemed, as Cae&s;ar did the &s;tab from his di&s;tingui&s;hed Brutus!</P>
<P>Tho' &s;he was &s;o very much di&s;ordered, I thought I would not lo&s;e this opportunity to a&s;&s;ert your innocence of this villainous arre&s;t.</P>
<P>There is no defending the unhappy man, in any of his vile actions by you, Madam; but of this la&s;t outrage, by all that's good and &s;acred, he is innocent!</P>
<P>O wretches! what a Sex is yours!&mdash;Have you all one
<PB N="167" REF="168">
dialect? <HI>Good and &s;acred!</HI>&mdash;If, Sir, you can find an oath, or a vow, or an adjuration, that my ears have not been twenty times a day wounded with, then &s;peak it, and I may again believe a MAN.</P>
<P>I was exce&s;&s;ively touched at the&s;e words, knowing thy ba&s;ene&s;s, and the rea&s;on &s;he had for them.</P>
<P>But &s;ay you, Sir; for I would not, methinks, have the wretch capable of this &s;ordid ba&s;ene&s;s!&mdash;Say you, that he is innocent of this <HI>la&s;t</HI> wickedne&s;s? Can you <HI>truly</HI> &s;ay that he is?</P>
<P>By the great God of Heaven!&mdash;</P>
<P>Nay, Sir, if you &s;wear, I mu&s;t doubt you!&mdash;If you your&s;elf think your WORD in&s;ufficient, what reliance can I have on your OATH!&mdash; O that this my experience had not co&s;t me &s;o dear! But, were I to live a <HI>thou&s;and</HI> years, I would always &s;u&s;pect the veracity of a &s;wearer. Ex|cu&s;e me, Sir; but is it likely, that <HI>he</HI> who makes &s;o free with his GOD, will &s;cruple any-thing that may &s;erve his turn with his <HI>fellow-creature?</HI></P>
<P>This was a mo&s;t affecting reprimand!</P>
<P>Madam, &s;aid I, I have a regard, a regard a gentleman <HI>ought</HI> to have, to my word; and whenever I forfeit it to you&mdash;</P>
<P>Nay, Sir, don't be angry with me. It is grievous to me to que&s;tion a gentleman's veracity. But your friend calls him&s;elf a <HI>gentleman</HI> &mdash; You know not what I have &s;uffered by a <HI>gentleman!</HI>&mdash;And then again &s;he wept.</P>
<P>I would give you, Madam, demon&s;tration, if your griefs and your weakne&s;s would permit it, that he has no hand in this barbarous ba&s;ene&s;s: And that he re&s;ents it as it ought to be re&s;ented.</P>
<P>Well, well, Sir [with quickne&s;s], he will have his ac|count to make up &s;omewhere el&s;e; not to me. I &s;hould not be &s;orry to find him able to acquit his intention on this occa&s;ion. Let him know, Sir, only one thing, that, when you heard me, in the bitterne&s;s of my &s;pirit, mo&s;t vehemently exclaim again&s;t the unde&s;erved u&s;age I have met with from him, that even <HI>then,</HI> in <HI>that</HI> pa&s;&s;ionate mo|ment, I was able to &s;ay [and never did I &s;ee &s;uch an ear|ne&s;t and affecting exaltation of hands and eyes], Give him, good God! repentance and amendment; that I
<PB N="168" REF="169">
may be the la&s;t poor creature, who &s;hall be ruined by him!&mdash;And, in thy own good time, receive to <HI>thy</HI> mercy, the poor wretch who had <HI>none</HI> on me!</P>
<P>By my &s;oul, I could not &s;peak. &mdash; She had not her Bible before her for nothing.</P>
<P>I was forced to turn my head away, and to take out my handkerchief.</P>
<P>What an angel is this!&mdash; Even the gaoler, and his wife and maid, wept.</P>
<P>Again, I wi&s;h thou had&s;t been there, that thou might&s;t have &s;unk down at her feet, and begun that moment to reap the effect of her generous wi&s;hes for thee; unde|&s;erving, as thou art, of any-thing but perdition!</P>
<P>I repre&s;ented to her, that &s;he would be le&s;s free where &s;he was, from vi&s;its &s;he liked not, than at her own lodg|ing. I told her, that it would probably bring her, in particular, <HI>one vi&s;itor,</HI> who, otherwi&s;e, I would engage (but I dur&s;t not &s;wear again, after the &s;evere reprimand &s;he had ju&s;t given me), &s;hould not come near her, with|out her con&s;ent. And I expre&s;&s;ed my &s;urprize, that &s;he &s;hould be unwilling to quit &s;uch a place as this; when it was more than probable, that &s;ome of her friends, when it was known how bad &s;he was, would vi&s;it her.</P>
<P>She &s;aid, the place, when &s;he was fir&s;t brought into it, was indeed very &s;hocking to her: But that &s;he had found her&s;elf &s;o weak and ill, and her griefs had &s;o &s;unk her, that &s;he did not expect to have lived till now: That there|fore all places had been alike to her; for to die in a pri|&s;on, <HI>was</HI> to die; and equally eligible as to die in a pa|lace (palaces, &s;he &s;aid, could have no attractions for a dying per&s;on): But that, &s;ince &s;he feared &s;he was not &s;o &s;oon to be relea&s;ed, as &s;he had hoped; &s;ince &s;he was &s;o little mi&s;tre&s;s of her&s;elf <HI>here;</HI> and &s;ince &s;he might, by re|moval, be in the way of her dear friend's letters; &s;he would hope, that &s;he might depend upon the a&s;&s;urances I gave her, of being at liberty to return to her la&s;t lodg|ings (otherwi&s;e &s;he would provide her&s;elf with new ones, out of my knowlege, as well as out of yours); and that I was too much of a gentleman, to be concerned in car|rying her back to the hou&s;e &s;he had &s;o much rea&s;on to abhor; and to which &s;he had been once before mo&s;t vilely betrayed, to her ruin.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="170">I a&s;&s;ured her, in the &s;tronge&s;t terms <HI>(but &s;wore not),</HI> that you were re&s;olved not to mole&s;t her: And, as a proof of the &s;incerity of my profe&s;&s;ions, be&s;ought her to give me directions (in pur&s;uance of my friend's expre&s;s de&s;ire) about &s;ending all her apparel, and whatever belonged to her, to her new lodgings.</P>
<P>She &s;eemed plea&s;ed; and gave me in&s;tantly out of her pocket her keys; a&s;king me, If Mrs. Smith, whom I had named, might not attend me; and &s;he would give <HI>her</HI> further directions? To which I chearfully a&s;&s;ented; and then &s;he told me, that &s;he would accept of the chair I had offered her.</P>
<P>I withdrew; and took the opportunity to be civil to Rowland and his maid; for &s;he found no fault with their behaviour, for what they <HI>were;</HI> and the fellow &s;eems to be mi&s;erably poor. I &s;ent al&s;o for the apothecary, who is as poor as the gaoler (and &s;till poorer, I dare &s;ay, as to the &s;kill required in his bu&s;ine&s;s), and &s;atisfied him be|yond his hopes.</P>
<P>The lady, after I had withdrawn, attempted to read the letters I brought her. But &s;he could read but a little way in one of them, and had great emotions upon it.</P>
<P>She told the woman &s;he would take a &s;peedy oppor|tunity to acknowlege their civiliti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, and to &s;atisfy the apothecary; who might &s;end her his bill to her lodgings.</P>
<P>She gave the maid &s;omething; probably, the only half-guinea &s;he had: And then, with difficulty, her limbs trem|bling under her, and &s;upported by Mrs. Rowland, got down &s;tairs.</P>
<P>I offered my arm: She was plea&s;ed to lean upon it. I doubt, Sir, &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d &s;he, as &s;he moved, I have behaved rudely to you: But, if you knew all, you would forgive me.</P>
<P>I know enough, Madam, to convince me, that there is not &s;uch purity and honour in any woman upon earth; nor any one that has been &s;o barbarou&s;ly treated.</P>
<P>She looked at me very earne&s;tly. What &s;he thought I cannot &s;ay; but, in general, I never &s;aw &s;o much &s;oul in a lady's eyes, as in hers.</P>
<P>I ordered my &s;ervant (who&s;e mourning made him le&s;s ob&s;ervable as &s;uch, and who had not been in the lady's eye) to keep the chair in view; and to bring me word,
<PB N="170" REF="171">
how &s;he did, when &s;et down. The fellow had the thought to &s;tep into the &s;hop ju&s;t before the chair entered it, under pretence of buying &s;nuff; and &s;o enabled him&s;elf to give me an account, that &s;he was received with great joy by the good woman of the hou&s;e; who told her, &s;he was but ju&s;t come in; and was preparing to attend her in High-Holborn.&mdash; O Mrs. Smith, &s;aid &s;he, as &s;oon at &s;he &s;aw her, did you not think I was run away?&mdash;You don't know what I have &s;uffered &s;ince I &s;aw you. I have been in a pri|&s;on!&mdash;Arre&s;ted for debts I owe not!&mdash;But, thank God, I am here!&mdash;Will you permit your maid&mdash;I have forgot her name already&mdash;</P>
<P>Katharine, Madam&mdash;</P>
<P>Will you let Katharine a&s;&s;i&s;t me to bed?&mdash; I have not had my cloaths off &s;ince Thur&s;day night.</P>
<P>What &s;he further &s;aid the fellow heard not, &s;he leaning upon the maid, and going up-&s;tairs.</P>
<P>But do&s;t thou not ob&s;erve, what a &s;trange, what an uncommon, openne&s;s of heart reigns in this lady: <HI>She had been in a pri&s;on,</HI> &s;he &s;aid, before a &s;tranger in the &s;hop, and before the maid-&s;ervant: And &s;o, probably, &s;he would have &s;aid, had there been twenty people in the &s;hop.</P>
<P>The di&s;grace &s;he cannot hide from <HI>her&s;elf,</HI> as &s;he &s;ays in her letter to Lady Betty, &s;he is not &s;olicitous to con|ceal from the <HI>world!</HI></P>
<P>But this makes it evident to me, that &s;he is re&s;olved to keep no terms with thee. And yet to be able to put up &s;uch a prayer for thee, as &s;he did in her pri&s;on [I will often mention the <HI>pri&s;on-room,</HI> to teaze thee!]; Does not this &s;hew, that revenge has very little &s;way in her mind; tho' &s;he can retain &s;o much proper re&s;entment?</P>
<P>And this is another excellence in this admirable wo|man's character: For whom, before her, have we met with in the whole &s;ex, or in ours either, that know how, in <HI>practice,</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h between REVENGE and RESENT|MENT, for ba&s;e and ingrateful treatment?</P>
<P>'Tis a cur&s;ed thing, after all, that &s;uch a woman as this &s;hould be treated as &s;he has been treated. Had&s;t thou been a king, and done as thou <HI>ha&s;t</HI> done by &s;uch a meritorious in|nocent, I believe in my heart, it would have been adjudged to be a national &s;in, and the &s;word, the pe&s;tilence, or fa|mine,
<PB N="171" REF="172">
mu&s;t have atoned for it!&mdash;But, as thou art a private man, thou wilt certainly meet with thy puni&s;hment (be&s;ides what thou maye&s;t expect from the ju&s;tice of thy country, and the vengeance of her friends), as &s;he will her reward, HEREAFTER.</P>
<P>It <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be &s;o, if there be really &s;uch a thing as <HI>future Remuneration;</HI> as now I am more and more convinced there mu&s;t:&mdash;El&s;e, what a hard fate is hers, who&s;e pu|ni&s;hment, to all appearance, has &s;o much exceeded her fault? And, as to thine, how can <HI>temporary</HI> burnings, wert thou by &s;ome accident to be con&s;umed in thy bed, expiate for thy abominable vilene&s;s to her, in breach of all obligations moral and divine?</P>
<P>I was re&s;olved to lo&s;e no time in having every-thing which belonged to the lady, at the cur&s;ed woman's, &s;ent her. Accordingly, I took coach to Smith's, and procured the lady (to whom I &s;ent up my compliments, and inqui|ries how &s;he bore her removal), ill as &s;he &s;ent me down word &s;he was, to give proper directions to Mrs. Smith&punc; Whom I took with me to Sinclair's; and who &s;aw every|thing looked out, and put into the trunks and boxes they were fir&s;t brought in, and carried away in two coaches.</P>
<P>Had I not been there, Sally and Polly would each of them have taken to her&s;elf &s;omething of the poor lady's &s;poils. This they declared: And I had &s;omething to do to get from Sally a fine Bru&s;&s;els-lace head, which &s;he had the confidence to &s;ay &s;he would wear for <HI>Mi&s;s Harlowe</HI>'s &s;ake. Nor &s;hould either I or Mrs. Smith have known &s;he had got it, had &s;he not been in &s;earch after the ruffles be|longing to it.</P>
<P>My re&s;entment on this occa&s;ion, and the conver&s;ation which Mrs. Smith and I had (in which I not only expa|tiated upon the merits of the lady, but expre&s;&s;ed my con|cern for her &s;ufferings; tho' I left her room to &s;uppo&s;e her married, yet without averring it), gave me high credit with the good woman: So that we are perfectly well-acquainted already: By which means I &s;hall be enabled to give you accounts, from time to time, of all that pa&s;&s;es; and which I will be very indu&s;trious to do, provided I may depend upon the &s;olemn promi&s;es I have given the lady, in your name, as well as my own, that &s;he &s;hall be free from all per&s;onal mole&s;tation from you.

<P>HAving &s;at up late to fini&s;h and &s;eal up in readine&s;s my letter to the above period, I am di&s;turbed before I wi&s;hed to have ri&s;en, by the arrival of thy &s;econd fellow; man and hor&s;e in a foam.</P>
<P>While he baits, I will write a few lines, mo&s;t heartily to congratulate thee on thy <HI>expected</HI> rage and impatience; and on thy recovery of mental feeling.</P>
<P>How much does the idea thou give&s;t me of thy de&s;erved torments, by thy upright awls, bodkins, pins, and pack|ing-needles, by thy rolling hog&s;head with iron &s;pikes, and by thy macerated &s;ides, delight me!</P>

<P>I Renewed my inquiries after the lady's health, in the morning, by my &s;ervant: And, as &s;oon as I had dined, I went my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I had but a poor account of it: Yet &s;ent up my com|pliments. She returned me thanks for all my good of|fices; and her excu&s;es, that they could not be <HI>per&s;onal</HI> ju&s;t then, being very low and faint: But if I gave my&s;elf the trouble of coming about &s;ix this evening, &s;he &s;hould be able, &s;he hoped, to drink a di&s;h of tea with me, and would then thank me her&s;elf.</P>
<P>I am very proud of this conde&s;cen&s;ion; and think it looks not ami&s;s for you, as I am your <HI>avowed</HI> friend. Methinks I want fully to remove from her mind all doubts of you in this la&s;t villainous action: And who knows then, what your noble relations may be able to do for you with her, if you hold your mind? For your &s;er|vant acquainted me with their having actually engaged Mi&s;s Howe in their and your favour, before this cur&s;ed affair happened. And I de&s;ire the particulars of all from your&s;elf, that I may the better know how to &s;erve you.</P>
<P>She has two hand&s;ome apartments, a bedchamber and dining-room, with light clo&s;ets in each. She has already a nur&s;e (the people of the hou&s;e having but one maid); a woman who&s;e care, diligence, and hone&s;ty, Mrs. Smith highly commends. She has likewi&s;e the benefit of the voluntary attendance, and <HI>love,</HI> as it &s;eems, of a widow gentlewoman, Mrs. Lovick her name, who lodges over her apartment, and of whom &s;he &s;eems very fond, having found &s;omething in her, &s;he thinks, re&s;embling the qua|lities of her worthy Mrs. Norton.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="175">About &s;even o' clock this morning, it &s;eems, the lady was &s;o ill, that &s;he yielded to their de&s;ires to have an apo|thecary &s;ent for&mdash;Not the fellow, thou may&s;t believe, &s;he had had before at Rowland's; but one Mr. Goddard, a man of &s;kill and eminence; and of con&s;cience too; de|mon&s;trated as well by general character, as by his pre|&s;criptions to this lady: For, pronouncing her ca&s;e to be grief, he ordered, for the pre&s;ent, only innocent julaps, by way of cordial; and, as &s;oon as her &s;tomach &s;hould be able to bear it, light kitchen-diet; telling Mrs. Lovick, that That, with air, moderate exerci&s;e, and chearful com|pany, would do her more good, than all the medicines in his &s;hop.</P>
<P>This has given me, as, it &s;eems, it has the lady (who al&s;o prai&s;es his mode&s;t behaviour, paternal looks, and genteel addre&s;s), a very good opinion of the man; and I de&s;ign to make my&s;elf acquainted with him; and, if he advi&s;es to call in a doctor, to wi&s;h him, for the fair patient's &s;ake, more than the phy&s;ician's (who wants not practice), my worthy friend Dr. H.&mdash;who&s;e character is above all ex|ception, as his humanity, I am &s;ure, will di&s;tingui&s;h him to the lady.</P>
<P>Mrs. Lovick gratified me with an account of a letter &s;he had written from the lady's mouth to Mi&s;s Howe; &s;he be|ing unable to write her&s;elf with &s;teadine&s;s. It was to this effect; in an&s;wer, it &s;eems, to her two letters, whatever were the contents of them:</P>
<P><Q>That &s;he had been involved in a dreadful calamity, which &s;he was &s;ure, when known, would exempt her from the effects of her friendly di&s;plea&s;ure, for not an|&s;wering her fir&s;t; having been put under an arre&s;t:&mdash; Could &s;he have believed it? &mdash; That &s;he was relea&s;ed but the day before: And was now &s;o weak, and &s;o low, that &s;he was obliged to get a widow gentlewoman in the &s;ame hou&s;e to account thus for her &s;ilence to her two letters of the 13th and 16th: That &s;he would, as &s;oon as able, an&s;wer them: Begged of her, mean time, not to be unea&s;y for her; &s;ince (only that this was a calamity which came upon her when &s;he was far from being well; a load laid upon the &s;houlders of a poor wretch, ready before to &s;ink under too heavy a burden)
<PB N="175" REF="176">
it was nothing to the evil &s;he had before &s;uffered: And one felicity &s;eemed likely to i&s;&s;ue from it; which was, that &s;he &s;hould be at re&s;t, in an hone&s;t hou&s;e, with con&s;iderate and kind-hearted people; having a&s;&s;urance given her, that &s;he &s;hould not be mole&s;ted by the wretch, whom it would be death for her to &s;ee: So that now &s;he (Mi&s;s Howe) needed not to &s;end to her by private and ex|pen&s;ive conveyances: Nor need Collins to take precau|tions for fear of being dogged to her lodgings; nor &s;he to write by a fictitious name to her, but by her own.</Q></P>
<P>You &s;ee I am in a way to oblige you: You &s;ee how much &s;he depends upon my engaging for your forbearing to intrude your&s;elf into her company: Let not your flaming impatience de&s;troy all; and make me look like a villain to a lady who has rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect <HI>every man &s;he &s;ees</HI> to be &s;o. &mdash; Upon this condition, you may ex|pect all the &s;ervices that can flow from true friend&s;hip, and from</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Tue&s;day night, July</HI> 18.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I AM ju&s;t come from the lady. I was admitted into the dining-room, where &s;he was &s;itting in an elbow-chair, in a very weak and low way. She made an effort to &s;tand up, when I entered; but was forced to keep her &s;eat. You'll excu&s;e me, Mr. Belford: I ought to ri&s;e, to thank you for all your kindne&s;s to me. I was to blame to be &s;o loth to leave that &s;ad place; for I am in Heaven here, to what I was there: And good people about me too!&mdash;I have not had good people about me for a long, long time before; &s;o that (with a half-&s;mile) I had begun to wonder whither they were all gone.</P>
<P>Her nur&s;e and Mrs. Smith, who were pre&s;ent, took oc|ca&s;ion to retire: And, when we were alone, You &s;eem to be a per&s;on of humanity, Sir, &s;aid &s;he: You hinted, as I was leaving <HI>my pri&s;on,</HI> that you were not a &s;tranger to my &s;ad &s;tory. If you know it <HI>truly,</HI> you mu&s;t know, that I have
<PB N="176" REF="177">
been mo&s;t barbarou&s;ly treated; and have not de&s;erved it at the man's hands by whom I have &s;uffered.</P>
<P>I told her, I knew enough to be convinced, that &s;he had the merit of a &s;aint, and the purity of an angel: And was proceeding, when &s;he &s;aid, No flighty compliments! No undue attributes, Sir! I offered to plead for my &s;in|cerity; and mentioned the word <HI>Politene&s;s,</HI> and would have di&s;tingui&s;hed between That and <HI>Flattery.</HI> Nothing can be polite, &s;aid &s;he, that is not ju&s;t: Whatever I <HI>may</HI> have had, I have <HI>now</HI> no vanity to gratify.</P>
<P>I di&s;claimed all intention of compliment: All I <HI>had</HI> &s;aid, and what I <HI>&s;hould</HI> &s;ay, was, and &s;hould be, the effect of &s;incere veneration. My unhappy friend's account of her had intitled her to That.</P>
<P>I then mentioned your grief, your penitence, your re|&s;olutions of making her all the amends that were po&s;&s;ible now to be made her: And, in the mo&s;t earne&s;t manner, I a&s;&s;erted your innocence as to the la&s;t villainous outrage.</P>
<P>Her an&s;wer was to this effect: It is painful to me to think of him. The amends you talk of, cannot be made. This la&s;t violence you &s;peak of, is nothing to what pre|ceded it. That cannot be atoned for; nor palliated: This may: And I &s;hall not be &s;orry to be convinced, that he cannot be guilty of &s;o very low a wickedne&s;s.&mdash;Yet, after his vile forgeries of hands&mdash;after his per&s;onating ba&s;e|ne&s;&s;es&mdash;what are the iniquities he is not capable of?</P>
<P>I would then have given her an account of the tryal you &s;tood with your friends: Your own previous re&s;olu|tions of marriage, had &s;he honoured you with the re|que&s;ted <HI>four words:</HI> All your family's earne&s;tne&s;s to have the honour of her alliance: And the application of your two cou&s;ins to Mi&s;s Howe, by general con&s;ent, for that young lady's intere&s;t with her: But, having ju&s;t touched upon the&s;e topics, &s;he cut me &s;hort, &s;aying, That was a cau&s;e before another tribunal: Mi&s;s Howe's letters to her were upon that &s;ubject; and &s;he &s;hould write her thoughts to <HI>her,</HI> as&s;oon as &s;he was able.</P>
<P>I then attempted more particularly to clear you of having any hand in the vile Sinclair's officious arre&s;t; a point &s;he had the genero&s;ity to <HI>wi&s;h</HI> you cleared of: And, hav|ing mentioned the outrageous letter you had written to
<PB N="177" REF="178">
me on this occa&s;ion, &s;he a&s;ked, If I had that letter about me?</P>
<P>I owned I had.</P>
<P>She wi&s;hed to &s;ee it.</P>
<P>This puzzled me horribly: For you mu&s;t needs think, that mo&s;t of the free things, which, among us Rakes, pa&s;s for wit and &s;pirit, mu&s;t be &s;hocking &s;tuff to the ears or eyes of per&s;ons of delicacy of that &s;ex: And then &s;uch an air of levity runs thro' thy mo&s;t &s;erious letters; &s;uch a fal&s;e bravery, endeavouring to carry off ludicrou&s;ly the &s;ubjects that mo&s;t affect thee; that tho&s;e letters are generally the lea&s;t fit to be &s;een, which ought to be mo&s;t to thy credit.</P>
<P>Something like this I ob&s;erved to her; and would fain have excu&s;ed my&s;elf from &s;hewing it: But &s;he was &s;o ear|ne&s;t, that I undertook to read &s;ome parts of it, re&s;olving to omit the mo&s;t exceptionable.</P>
<P>I know thou'lt cur&s;e me for that; but I thought it bet|ter to oblige her, than to be &s;u&s;pected my&s;elf; and &s;o not have it in my power to &s;erve thee with her, when &s;o good a foundation was laid for it; and when &s;he knows as bad of thee as I can tell her.</P>
<P>Thou remembre&s;t the contents, I &s;uppo&s;e, of thy furi|ous letter <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>See p.</HI> 129, 130.</NOTE>. Her remarks upon the different parts of it which I read to her, were to the following effect:</P>
<P>Upon thy two fir&s;t lines, <HI>All undone! undone, by Jupi|ter! &mdash; Zounds, Jack, what &s;hall I do now! A cur&s;e upon all my plots and contrivances!</HI> thus &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf:</P>
<P><Q>O how light, how unaffected with the &s;en&s;e of its own crimes, is the heart that could dictate to the pen this libertine froth!</Q></P>
<P>The paragraph, which mentions the vile arre&s;t, affected her a good deal.</P>
<P>In the next, I omitted thy cur&s;e upon thy relations, whom thou wert gallanting: And read on the &s;even &s;ub|&s;equent paragraphs, down to thy execrable wi&s;h; which was too &s;hocking to read to her. What I read produced the following reflections from her:</P>
<P><Q>The plots and contrivances which he cur&s;es, and the exultings of the wicked wretches on finding me out, &s;hew me, that all his guilt was premeditated: Nor doubt
<PB N="178" REF="179">
I, that his dreadful perjuries, and inhuman arts, as he went along, were to pa&s;s for fine &s;tratagems; for witty &s;port; and to demon&s;trate a &s;uperiority of inventive ta|lents!&mdash;O my cruel, cruel brother! had it not been for thee, I had not been thrown upon &s;o pernicious and &s;o de&s;picable a plotter.!&mdash;But proceed, Sir; pray proceed.</Q></P>
<P>At that part, <HI>Can&s;t thou, O fatal progno&s;ticator! tell me where my puni&s;hments will end?</HI> &mdash; &s;he &s;ighed: And when I came to that &s;entence, <HI>Praying for my reformation, perhaps</HI>&mdash;Is that there? &s;aid &s;he, &s;ighing again.&mdash;Wretch|ed man!&mdash;And &s;hed a tear for thee.&mdash;By my faith, Love|lace, I believe &s;he hates thee not! &mdash; She has at lea&s;t a concern, a generous concern, for thy future happine&s;s!&mdash; What a noble creature ha&s;t thou injured!</P>
<P>She made a very &s;evere reflection upon me, on read|ing the&s;e words&mdash; <HI>On your knees, for me, beg her pardon</HI>&mdash;
<Q>You had all your le&s;&s;ons, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, when you came to redeem me &mdash; You was &s;o conde&s;cending as to kneel: I thought it was the effect of your own humanity, and good-natured earne&s;tne&s;s to &s;erve me: Excu&s;e me, Sir, I knew not, that it was in con&s;equence of a pre&s;cribed le&s;&s;on.</Q></P>
<P>This concerned me not a little: I could not bear to be thought &s;uch a wretched puppet, &s;uch a Jo&s;eph Leman, &s;uch a Tomlin&s;on &mdash; I endeavoured therefore, with &s;ome warmth, to clear my&s;elf of this reflection; and &s;he again a&s;ked my excu&s;e: <Q>I was avowedly, &s;he &s;aid, the friend of a man, who&s;e friend&s;hip, &s;he had rea&s;on to be &s;orry to &s;ay, was no credit to any-body.</Q>
&mdash; And de&s;ired me to proceed. &mdash; I did; but fared not much better after|wards: For,</P>
<P>On that pa&s;&s;age, where you &s;ay, <HI>I had always been her friend and advocate,</HI> This was her unan&s;werable remark: <Q>I find, Sir, by this expre&s;&s;ion, that he had always de|&s;igns again&s;t me; and that you all along knew that he had: Would to Heaven, you had had the goodne&s;s to have contrived &s;ome way, that might not have endan|gered your own &s;afety, to give me notice of his ba&s;e|ne&s;s, &s;ince you approved not of it! But you gentlemen, I &s;uppo&s;e, had rather &s;ee an innocent fellow-creature ruined, than be thought capable of an action, which,
<PB N="179" REF="180">
however generous, might be likely to loo&s;en the bands of a wicked friend&s;hip!</Q></P>
<P>After this &s;evere but ju&s;t reflection, I would have avoided reading the following, altho' I had unawares begun the &s;entence (but &s;he held me to it): <HI>What would I now give, had I permitted you to have been a &s;ucce&s;sful advocate!</HI> And this was her remark upon it&mdash;<Q>So, Sir, you &s;ee, if you had been the happy means of preventing the evils de|&s;igned me, you would have had your friend's thanks for it, when he came to his con&s;ideration. This &s;ati&s;|faction, I am per&s;uaded every-one, in the long run, will enjoy, who has the virtue to with&s;tand, or prevent, a wicked purpo&s;e. I was obliged, <HI>I &s;ee,</HI> to your kind wi&s;hes&mdash;But it was a point of honour with you to keep his &s;ecret; the greater honour, perhaps, the viler the &s;ecret. Yet permit me to wi&s;h, Mr. Belford, that you were ca|pable of reli&s;hing the plea&s;ures that ari&s;e to a benevolent mind from VIRTUOUS friend&s;hip!&mdash;None <HI>other</HI> is wor|thy of the &s;acred name. You &s;eem an humane man: I hope, for your own &s;ake, you will one day experience the difference: And, when you do, think of Mi&s;s Howe and Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe (I find you know much of my &s;ad &s;tory), who were the happie&s;t creatures on earth in each other's friend&s;hip, till this friend of yours</Q>&mdash;And there &s;he &s;topt, and turned from me.</P>
<P>Where thou calle&s;t thy&s;elf <HI>A villainous plotter;</HI> <Q>To take crime to him&s;elf, &s;aid &s;he, without &s;hame, O what a hardened wretch is this man!</Q></P>
<P>On that pa&s;&s;age, where thou &s;aye&s;t, <HI>Let me know how &s;he has been treated: If roughly, woe be to the guilty!</HI> this was her remark, with an air of indignation: <Q>What a man is your friend, Sir!&mdash;Is &s;uch a one as <HI>he</HI> to &s;et him|&s;elf up to puni&s;h the guilty? &mdash; All the <HI>rough</HI> u&s;age I could receive from them, was infinitely <HI>le&s;s</HI></Q>&mdash;And there &s;he &s;topt, a moment or two: Then proceeding&mdash;<Q>And who &s;hall puni&s;h <HI>him?</HI> What an a&s;&s;uming wretch!&mdash; No-body but <HI>him&s;elf</HI> is intitled to injure the innocent?&mdash; He is, I &s;uppo&s;e, on earth, to act the part, which the malignant fiend is &s;uppo&s;ed to act below: Dealing out puni&s;hments, at his plea&s;ure, to every inferior in&s;tru|ment of mi&s;chief!</Q></P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="181">What, thought I, have I been doing! I &s;hall have this &s;avage fellow think I have been playing him booty, in reading part of his letter to this &s;agacious lady!&mdash; Yet, if thou art angry, it can only, in rea&s;on, be at thy&s;elf; for who would think I might not communicate to her &s;ome of the lea&s;t exceptionable parts of a letter (as a proof of thy &s;incerity in exculpating thy&s;elf from a criminal charge), which thou wrote&s;t to thy friend, to convince <HI>him</HI> of thy innocence? But a bad heart, and a bad cau&s;e, are confound|ing things: And &s;o let us put it to its proper account.</P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed over thy charge to me, to cur&s;e them by the hour; and thy names of <HI>Dragon</HI> and <HI>Serpents,</HI> tho' &s;o ap|plicable; &s;ince, had I read them, thou mu&s;t have been &s;uppo&s;ed to know from the fir&s;t, what creatures they were; vile fellow as thou wert, for bringing &s;o much purity among them! And I clo&s;ed with thy own concluding pa|ragraph, <HI>A line! A line! A kingdom for a line!</HI> &amp;c. How|ever telling her, &s;ince &s;he &s;aw, that I omitted &s;ome &s;en|tences, that there were further vehemences in it; but as they were better fitted to &s;hew to me the &s;incerity of the writer, than for &s;o delicate an ear as hers to hear, I cho&s;e to pa&s;s them over.</P>
<P>You have read enough, &s;aid &s;he &mdash; He is a wicked, wicked man!&mdash;I &s;ee he intended to have me in his power at any rate; and I have no doubt of what his purpo&s;es were, by what his actions have been.

What has he not invented! And all for what?&mdash;Only, to ruin a poor young creature, whom he ought to have protected; and whom he had fir&s;t de|prived of all other protection?</P>
<P>She aro&s;e, and turned from me, her handkerchief at her eyes: And, after a pau&s;e, came towards me again&mdash;
<Q>I hope, &s;aid &s;he, I talk to a man, who has a better heart: And I thank you, Sir, for all your kind, tho' ineffectual, pleas in my favour formerly, whether the motives for them were compa&s;&s;ion, or principle, or both. That they <HI>were</HI> ineffectual, might very probably be owing to your want of earne&s;tne&s;s; and <HI>that,</HI> as <HI>you</HI>

<P>I was afraid, for thy &s;ake, to let her know how <HI>very</HI> earne&s;t I had been: But a&s;&s;ured her, that I had been her zealous friend; and that my motives were founded upon a merit, that, I believed, was never equalled: That, however indefen&s;ible Mr. Lovelace was, he had always done ju&s;tice to her virtue: That to a full conviction of her untainted honour it was owing, that he &s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ired to call &s;o ine&s;timable a jewel his &mdash;And was pro|ceeding, when &s;he again cut me &s;hort&mdash;</P>
<P>Enough, and too much, of this &s;ubject, Sir!&mdash;If he will never more let me behold his face, that is all I have now to a&s;k of him.&mdash;Indeed, indeed, cla&s;ping her hands, <HI>I never will,</HI> if I can, by any means not criminally de|&s;perate, avoid it.</P>
<P>What could I &s;ay for thee?&mdash;There was no room, how|ever, <HI>at that time,</HI> to touch this &s;tring again, for fear of bringing upon my&s;elf a prohibition, not only of the &s;ub|ject, but of ever attending her again.</P>
<P>I gave &s;ome di&s;tant intimations of money-matters. I &s;hould have told thee, that, when I read to her that pa&s;&s;|age, where thou bidde&s;t me force what &s;ums upon her I can get her to take&mdash;&s;he repeated, No, no, no, no! &s;eve|ral times with great quickne&s;s; and I dur&s;t no more than ju&s;t intimate it again&mdash;and that &s;o darkly, as left her room to &s;eem not to under&s;tand me.</P>
<P>Indeed I know not the per&s;on, man or woman, I &s;hould be &s;o much afraid of di&s;obliging, or incurring a cen&s;ure from, as from her. She has &s;o much true dignity in her manner, without pride or arrogance; which, in tho&s;e who have either, one is tempted to mortify; &s;uch a piercing eye, yet &s;oftened &s;o &s;weetly with rays of benignity, that &s;he commands all one's reverence.</P>
<P>Methinks I have a kind of holy love for this angel of a woman; and it is matter of a&s;toni&s;hment to me, that thou could&s;t conver&s;e with her a quarter of an hour together, and hold thy devili&s;h purpo&s;es.</P>

I was with-held by notions of fal&s;e honour, as &s;he ju&s;tly reproached me, becau&s;e of thy own <HI>voluntary</HI> communi|cations to me of thy purpo&s;es: And then, as &s;he was brought into &s;uch a cur&s;ed hou&s;e, and was &s;o watched by thy&s;elf, as well as by thy infernal agents, I thought (knowing my man!), that I &s;hould only accelerate the in|tended mi&s;chiefs.&mdash;Moreover, finding thee &s;o much over|awed by her virtue, that thou had&s;t not, at thy <HI>fir&s;t</HI> carry|ing her thither, the courage to attempt her; and that &s;he had, more than once, without knowing thy ba&s;e views, obliged thee to abandon them, and to re&s;olve to do her ju&s;tice, and thy&s;elf honour; I hardly doubted, that her merit would be triumphant at la&s;t.</P>
<P>It is my opinion (if thou holde&s;t thy purpo&s;es to marry), that thou can&s;t not do better, than to procure thy real aunts, and thy real cou&s;ins, to pay her a vi&s;it, and to be thy advocates: But, if they decline per&s;onal vi&s;its, letters from them, and from my Lord M. &s;upported by Mi&s;s Howe's intere&s;t, may, perhaps, effect &s;omething in thy favour.</P>
<P>But the&s;e are only my hopes, founded on what I <HI>wi&s;h</HI> for thy &s;ake. The lady, I really think, would choo&s;e death rather than thee: And the two women are of opi|nion, tho' they know not half of what &s;he has &s;uffered, that her heart is actually broken.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLVII. <HI>Mr.</HI> BELFORD, <HI>To</HI> ROBERT LOVELACE, <ABBR><HI>E&s;q</HI></ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Wedne&s;day, July</HI> 19.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THIS morning I took chair to Smith's; and, being told, that the lady had a very bad night, but was up, I &s;ent for her worthy apothecary; who, on his com|ing to me, approving of my propo&s;al of calling in Dr. H. I bid the women acquaint her with the de&s;igned vi&s;it.</P>
<P>It &s;eems, &s;he was at fir&s;t di&s;plea&s;ed; yet withdrew her objection: But, after a pau&s;e, a&s;ked them, What &s;he &s;hould do? She had effects of value, &s;ome of which &s;he intended, as &s;oon as &s;he <HI>could,</HI> to turn into money; but, till then, had not a &s;ingle guinea to give the Doctor for his fee.</P>
<P>Mrs. Lovick &s;aid, &s;he had five guineas by her: They were at her &s;ervice.</P>
<P>She would accept of three, &s;he &s;aid, if &s;he would take <HI>that</HI> (pulling a diamond ring from her finger), till &s;he re|paid her; but on no other terms.</P>
<P>Having been told, I was below with Mr. Goddard, &s;he de&s;ired to &s;peak one word with me, before &s;he &s;aw the Doctor.</P>
<P>She was &s;itting in an elbow-chair, leaning her head on a pillow; Mrs. Smith and the widow on each &s;ide her chair; her nur&s;e, with a phial of hart&s;horn, behind her; in her own hand, her &s;alts.</P>
<P>Rai&s;ing her head at my entrance, &s;he inquired, If the Doctor knew Mr. Lovelace?</P>
<P>I told her, No; and that I believed you never &s;aw him in your life.</P>
<P>Was the Doctor my friend?</P>
<P>He was; and a very worthy and &s;kilful man. I named him for his eminence in his profe&s;&s;ion: And Mr. Goddard &s;aid, he knew not a better phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>I have but one condition to make before I &s;ee the gentleman; that he refu&s;e not his fees from me. If I am poor, Sir, I am proud. I will not be under obli|gation. You may <HI>believe,</HI> Sir, I will not. I &s;uffer this vi&s;it, becau&s;e I would not appear ingrateful to the few friends I have left, nor ob&s;tinate to &s;uch of my relations,
<PB N="184" REF="185">
as may &s;ome time hence, for their private &s;atisfaction, inquire after my behaviour in my &s;ick hours. So, Sir, you know the condition. And don't let me be vexed: I am very ill; and cannot debate the matter.</P>
<P>Seeing her &s;o determined, I told her, If it mu&s;t be &s;o, it &s;hould.</P>
<P>Then, Sir, the gentleman may come. But I &s;hall not be able to an&s;wer many que&s;tions. Nur&s;e, you can tell him, at the window there, what a night I have had, and how I have been for two days pa&s;t. And Mr. Goddard, if he be here, can let him know what I have taken. Pray let me be as little que&s;tioned, as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The Doctor paid his re&s;pects to her, with the gentle|manly addre&s;s for which he is noted: And &s;he ca&s;t up her &s;weet eyes to him, with that benignity which accom|panies her every graceful look.</P>
<P>I would have retired; but &s;he forbid it.</P>
<P>He took her hand, the lily not of &s;o beautiful a white; Indeed, Madam, you are very low, &s;aid he: But, give me leave to &s;ay, That you can do more for your&s;elf, than all the faculty can do for you.</P>
<P>He then withdrew to the window. And, after a &s;hort conference with the women, he turned to me, and to Mr. Goddard, at the other window: We can do nothing here, &s;peaking low, but by cordials, and nouri&s;hment. What friends has the lady? She &s;eems to be a per&s;on of condi|tion; and, ill as &s;he is, a very fine woman.&mdash;A &s;ingle lady, I pre&s;ume?</P>
<P>I whi&s;peringly told him &s;he was. That there were ex|traordinary circum&s;tances in her ca&s;e; as I would have ap|pri&s;ed him, had I met with him ye&s;terday. That her friends were very cruel to her; but that &s;he could not hear them named, without reproaching her&s;elf; tho' they were much more to blame, than &s;he.</P>
<P>I knew I was right, &s;aid the Doctor. A love-ca&s;e, Mr. Goddard! A love-ca&s;e, Mr. Belford! There is one per|&s;on in the world, who can do her more &s;ervice, than all the faculty.</P>
<P>Mr. Goddard &s;aid, he had apprehended her di&s;order was in her mind; and had treated her accordingly: And then told the Doctor what he had done: Which he approving
<PB N="185" REF="186">
of, again taking her charming hand, &s;aid, My good young Lady, you will require very little of our a&s;&s;i&s;tance. You mu&s;t, in a great mea&s;ure, be your own doctre&s;s. Come, <HI>dear</HI> Madam (Forgive me the familiar tenderne&s;s; your a&s;pect commands love, as well as reverence; and a father of children, &s;ome of them older than your&s;elf, may be excu&s;ed for them), chear up your &s;pirits. Re&s;olve to do all in your power to be well; and you'll &s;oon grow better.</P>
<P>You are very kind, Sir, &s;aid &s;he. I will take whatever you direct. My &s;pirits have been hurried. I &s;hall be better, I believe, before I am wor&s;e. The care of my good friends here, looking at the women, &s;hall not meet with an ingrateful return.</P>
<P>The Doctor wrote. He would fain have declined his fee. As her malady, he &s;aid, was rather to be relieved by the &s;oothings of a friend, than by the pre&s;criptions of a phy&s;ician, he &s;hould think him&s;elf greatly honoured to be admitted rather to <HI>advi&s;e</HI> her in the <HI>one</HI> character, than to <HI>pre&s;cribe</HI> to her in the <HI>other.</HI></P>
<P>She an&s;wered, That &s;he &s;hould be always glad to &s;ee &s;o humane a gentleman: That his vi&s;its would <HI>keep her in charity with his &s;ex:</HI> But that, were &s;he to <HI>forget</HI> that he was her <HI>phy&s;ician,</HI> &s;he might be apt to abate of the con|fidence in his &s;kill, which might be nece&s;&s;ary to effect the amendment that was the end of his vi&s;its.</P>
<P>And when he urged her &s;till further, which he did in a very polite manner, and as pa&s;&s;ing by the door two or three times a day, &s;he &s;aid, &s;he &s;hould always have plea&s;ure in con&s;idering him in the kind light he <HI>offered him&s;elf to her:</HI> That <HI>that</HI> might be very generous in one per&s;on to offer, which would be as ungenerous in another to accept: That indeed &s;he was not at pre&s;ent high in circum&s;tance; and he &s;aw by the tender (which he <HI>mu&s;t</HI> accept of), that &s;he had greater re&s;pect to <HI>her own convenience,</HI> than to <HI>his merit,</HI> or than to the <HI>plea&s;ure</HI> &s;he &s;hould take in his vi&s;its.</P>
<P>We all withdrew together; and the Doctor and Mr. Goddard having a great curio&s;ity to know &s;omething more of her &s;tory, at the motion of the latter we went into a neighbouring coffee-hou&s;e, and I gave them, in confi|dence, a brief relation of it; making all as light for you as I could; and yet you'll &s;uppo&s;e, that, in order to do but

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Three o' clock, afternoon.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I JUST now called again at Smith's; and am told &s;he is &s;omewhat better; which &s;he attributed to the &s;oothings of her Doctor. She expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf highly plea&s;ed with both gentlemen; and &s;aid, that their behaviour to her was perfectly <HI>paternal.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Paternal,</HI> poor lady! &mdash; Never having been, till very lately, from under her parents wings, and now abandon'd by all her friends, &s;he is for finding out &s;omething <HI>pater|nal</HI> and <HI>maternal</HI> in every one (the latter qualities in Mrs. Lovick and Mrs. Smith), to &s;upply to her&s;elf the father and mother her dutiful heart pants after!</P>
<P>Mrs. Smith told me, that, after we were gone, &s;he gave the keys of her trunks and drawers to her and the widow Lovick, and de&s;ired them to take an inventory of them; which they did, in her pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>They al&s;o informed me, That &s;he had reque&s;ted them to find her a purcha&s;er for two rich dre&s;s'd &s;uits; one never worn, the other not above once or twice.</P>
<P>This &s;hock'd me exceedingly: <HI>Perhaps it may thee a little!!!</HI>&mdash;Her rea&s;on for &s;o doing, &s;he told them, was, That &s;he &s;hould never live to wear them: That her &s;i&s;ter, and other relations, were above wearing them: That her mother would not endure in her &s;ight any-thing that was hers: That &s;he wanted the money: That &s;he would not be obliged to any-body, when &s;he had effects by her, which &s;he had no occa&s;ion for: And yet, &s;aid &s;he, I expect not, that they will fetch a price an&s;werable to their value.</P>
<P>They were both very much concerned, as they own'd; and a&s;ked my advice upon it: And the richne&s;s of her ap|parel having given them a &s;till higher notion of her rank, than they had before, they &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he mu&s;t be of quality; and again wanted to know her &s;tory.</P>
<P>I told them, That &s;he was indeed a lady of family and fortune: I &s;till gave them room to &s;uppo&s;e her married: But left it to her to tell them all in her own time and manner: All I would &s;ay, was, That &s;he had been very vilely treated; de&s;erved it not; and was all innocence and purity.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="188">You may &s;uppo&s;e, that they both expre&s;&s;ed their a&s;to|ni&s;hment, that there could be a man in the world, who could ill-treat &s;o fine a creature.</P>
<P>As to di&s;po&s;ing of the two &s;uits of apparel, I told Mrs. Smith, That &s;he &s;hould pretend, that, upon inquiry, &s;he had found a friend, who would purcha&s;e the riche&s;t of them; but <HI>(that &s;he might not mi&s;tru&s;t)</HI> would &s;tand upon a good bargain. And having twenty guineas about me, I left them with her, in part of payment; and bid her <HI>pretend</HI> to get her to part with it for as little more as &s;he could induce her to take.</P>
<P>I am &s;etting out for Edgware with poor Belton&mdash;More of whom in my next. I &s;hall return to-morrow; and leave This in readine&s;s for your me&s;&s;enger, if he &s;hall call in my ab&s;ence. Adieu!</P>

<P>THOU might&s;t well apprehend, that I &s;hould think thou wert playing me booty, in communicating my letter to the lady.</P>
<P>Thou a&s;ke&s;t, Who would think thou might&s;t not read to her the lea&s;t exceptionable parts of a letter written in my own defence to thee?&mdash;<HI>I'll tell thee who</HI>&mdash; The man, who, in the &s;ame letter that he a&s;ks this que&s;tion, tells the friend whom he expo&s;es to her re&s;entment,
<Q>That there is &s;uch an air of levity runs thro' his mo&s;t &s;erious letters, that tho&s;e of his are <HI>lea&s;t fit to be &s;een,</HI> which ought to be <HI>mo&s;t to his credit:</HI></Q>
And now, what thinke&s;t thou of thy &s;elf-condemned folly? Be, however, I charge thee, more circum&s;pect for the future, that &s;o this clum&s;y error may &s;tand &s;ingly by it&s;elf.</P>
<P><Q>It is painful to her to think of me!</Q> <Q>Libertine froth!</Q> <Q>So pernicious and &s;o de&s;picable a plotter!</Q> <Q>A man who&s;e friend&s;hip is no credit to any-body!</Q> <Q>Harden'd wretch!</Q> <Q>The devil's counterpart!</Q> <Q>A wicked, wicked man!</Q> &mdash; But <HI>did</HI> &s;he, <HI>could</HI> &s;he, <HI>dared</HI> &s;he, to &s;ay or <HI>imply</HI> all this?&mdash;And &s;ay it to a man whom &s;he

<P>The prai&s;e thou give&s;t to her <HI>ingenuou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> is another of thy peculiars. I think not as <HI>thou</HI> do&s;t, of her tell-tale recapitulations and exclamations:&mdash;What end can they an&s;wer? &mdash; Only that thou ha&s;t an <HI>holy</HI> love [The devil fetch thee for thy oddity!], or it is extremely provoking to &s;uppo&s;e one &s;ees &s;uch a charming creature &s;tand up|right before a libertine, and talk of the &s;in again&s;t her, that cannot be forgiven!&mdash;I wi&s;h at my heart, that the&s;e cha&s;te ladies would have a little mode&s;ty in their anger!&mdash; It would &s;ound very &s;trange, if I Robert Lovelace &s;hould pretend to have more true delicacy, in a point that re|quires the utmo&s;t, than Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe.</P>
<P>I think I will put it into the head of her Nur&s;e Norton, and her Mi&s;s Howe, by &s;ome one of my agents, to chide the dear novice for her proclamations.</P>
<P>But to be &s;erious; Let me tell thee, that &s;evere as &s;he is, and &s;aucy, in a&s;king &s;o contemptuou&s;ly, <Q>What a man is your friend, Sir, to &s;et him&s;elf to puni&s;h guilty people!</Q> I will never forgive the cur&s;ed woman, who could commit this la&s;t horrid violence on &s;o excellent a creature.</P>
<P>The barbarous in&s;ults of the two nymphs, in their vi&s;its to her; the choice of the mo&s;t execrable den that could be found out, in order, no doubt, to induce her to go back to theirs; and the &s;till more execrable attempt, to propo&s;e to her a man who would pay the debt; a &s;nare, I make no que&s;tion, laid for her de&s;pairing and re|&s;enting heart by that devili&s;h Sally (thinking her, no doubt, a <HI>woman</HI>), in order to ruin her with me; and to provoke me, in a fury, to give her up to their remor&s;ele&s;s cruelty; are outrages, that, to expre&s;s my&s;elf in her &s;tyle, I never <HI>can,</HI> never <HI>will,</HI> forgive.</P>
<P>But as to thy opinion, and the two womens at Smith's, that her heart is broken; that is the true womens lan|guage:
<PB N="189" REF="190">
I wonder how <HI>thou</HI> came&s;t into it: Thou who ha&s;t &s;een and heard of &s;o many <HI>female deaths</HI> and <HI>revivals.</HI></P>
<P>I'll tell thee what makes <HI>again&s;t</HI> this notion of theirs.</P>
<P>Her time of life, and charming con&s;titution: The good &s;he ever delighted to do, and fancied &s;he was born to do: And which &s;he may &s;till continue to do, to as high a degree as ever; nay, higher; &s;ince I am no &s;ordid varlet, thou knowe&s;t: Her religious turn; a turn that will always teach her to bear <HI>inevitable</HI> evils with patience: The contemplation upon her la&s;t noble triumph over me, and over the whole crew; and upon her &s;ucceeding e&s;cape from us all: Her will unviolated: And the inward pride of having not de&s;erved the treatment &s;he has met with.</P>
<P>How is it po&s;&s;ible to imagine, that a woman, who has all the&s;e <HI>con&s;olatories</HI> to reflect upon, will die of a broken heart?</P>
<P>On the contrary, I make no doubt, but that, as &s;he recovers from the dejection into which this la&s;t &s;curvy villainy (which none but wretches of her own &s;ex <HI>could</HI> have been guilty of), has thrown her, returning Love will re-enter her time-pacified mind: Her thoughts will then turn once more on the conjugal pivot: Of cour&s;e &s;he will have livelier notions in her head; and the&s;e will make her perform all her circumvolutions with ea&s;e and plea&s;ure; tho' not with &s;o high a degree of either, as if the dear proud rogue could have exalted her&s;elf above the re&s;t of her &s;ex, as &s;he turned round.</P>
<P>Thou a&s;ke&s;t, on reciting the bitter invectives that the lady made again&s;t thy poor friend (&s;tanding before her, I &s;uppo&s;e, with thy fingers in thy mouth), <HI>What could&s;t thou &s;ay</HI> FOR <HI>me?</HI></P>
<P>Have I not, in my former letters, &s;ugge&s;ted an hun|dred things, which a friend, <HI>in earne&s;t</HI> to vindicate or ex|cu&s;e a friend, might &s;ay, on &s;uch an occa&s;ion?</P>
<P>But now to current topics, and the pre&s;ent &s;tate of matters here &mdash; It is true, as my &s;ervant told thee, that Mi&s;s Howe had engaged, before this cur&s;ed woman's of|ficiou&s;ne&s;s, to u&s;e her intere&s;t with her friend in my be|half: And yet &s;he told my cou&s;ins, in the vi&s;it they made her, that it was her opinion, that &s;he would never for|give me.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="191">I long to know what Mi&s;s Howe wrote to her friend, in order to induce her to marry the <HI>de&s;picable plotter;</HI> the <HI>man who&s;e friend&s;hip is no credit to any-body;</HI> the <HI>wicked, wicked man.</HI> Thou had&s;t the two letters in thy hand. Had they been in mine, the &s;eal would have yielded to the touch of my warm finger [Perhaps without the help of the po&s;t-office bullet], and the folds, as other plications have done, open'd of them&s;elves, to oblige my curio&s;ity.

<P>My two aunts, finding the treaty, upon the &s;ucce&s;s of which they have &s;et their fooli&s;h hearts, likely to run into length, are about departing to their own &s;eats; having taken from me the be&s;t &s;ecurity the nature of the ca&s;e will admit of, that is to &s;ay, <HI>my word,</HI> to marry the lady, if &s;he will have me.</P>
<P>All I have to do, in my pre&s;ent uncertainty, is, to brighten up my faculties, by filing off the ru&s;t they have contracted by the town &s;moke, a long impri&s;onment in my clo&s;e attendance to &s;o little purpo&s;e on my fair per|ver&s;e; and to brace up, if I can, the relaxed fibres of my mind, which have been twitch'd and convuls'd like the nerves of &s;ome tottering paralytic, by means of the tumults &s;he has excited in it; that &s;o I may be able to pre&s;ent to her a hu&s;band as worthy as I can be of her ac|ceptance; or, if &s;he reject me, be in a capacity to re|&s;ume my u&s;ual gaiety of heart, and &s;hew others of the mi&s;leading &s;ex, that I am not di&s;couraged by the diffi|culties I have met with from this &s;weet individual of it, from endeavouring to make my&s;elf as acceptable to them as before.</P>
<P>In this latter ca&s;e, one tour to France and Italy, I dare &s;ay, will do the bu&s;ine&s;s. Mi&s;s Harlowe will by that time have forgotten all &s;he has &s;uffered from the ingrate|ful Lovelace: Tho' it will be impo&s;&s;ible that her Lovelace &s;hould ever forget a woman, who&s;e equal he de&s;pairs to meet with, were he to travel from one end of the world to the other.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="192">If thou continue&s;t paying off the heavy debts my long letters, for &s;o many weeks together, have made thee groan under, I will endeavour to re&s;train my&s;elf in the de&s;ires I have (importunate as they are) of going to town, to throw my&s;elf at the feet of my &s;oul's beloved. <HI>Policy,</HI> and <HI>hone&s;ty,</HI> both join to &s;trengthen the re&s;traint my <HI>own promi&s;e</HI> and <HI>thy engagement</HI> have laid me under on this head. I would not afre&s;h provoke: On the contrary, would give time for her re&s;entments to &s;ub&s;ide, that &s;o all that follows may be her own act and deed.</P>
<P>HICKMAN [I have a mortal aver&s;ion to that fellow!] has, by a line which I have ju&s;t now received, reque&s;ted an interview with me on Friday at Mr. Dormer's, as at a <HI>common friend</HI>'s. Does the bu&s;ine&s;s he wants to meet me upon, require that it &s;hould be at a <HI>common friend</HI>'s?&mdash; A challenge implied; i'n't it, Belford? &mdash; I &s;hall not be civil to him, I doubt. He has been an intermeddler!&mdash; Then I envy him on Mi&s;s Howe's account: For if I have a right notion of this Hickman, it is impo&s;&s;ible that that virago can ever love him.</P>
<P>A charming encouragement for a man of intrigue, when he has rea&s;on to believe, that the woman he has a view upon has no love for her husband! What good prin|ciples mu&s;t that wife have, who is kept in again&s;t tempta|tion by a &s;en&s;e of her duty, and plighted faith, where affe|ction has no hold of her!</P>
<P>Pr'ythee let's know, very particularly, how it fares with poor Belton.&mdash;'Tis an hone&s;t fellow.&mdash;Something more than his Thoma&s;ine &s;eems to &s;tick with him.</P>
<P>Tourville, Mowbray, and my&s;elf, pa&s;s away our time as plea&s;antly as po&s;&s;ibly we can without thee. I wi&s;h we don't add to Lord M.'s gouty days by the joy we give him.</P>
<P>This is one advantage, as I believe I have el&s;ewhere ob&s;erved, that we male-delinquents in love-matters have of the other &s;ex:&mdash;For while they, poor things! &s;it &s;igh|ing in holes and corners, or run to woods and groves to bemoan them&s;elves for their baffled hopes, we can rant and roar, hunt and hawk; and, by new loves, bani&s;h from our hearts all remembrance of the old ones.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="193">Merrily, however, as we pa&s;s our time, my reflections upon the injuries done to this noble creature bring a qualm upon my heart very often. But I know &s;he will permit me to make her amends, after &s;he has plagued me hearti|ly; and that's my con&s;olation.</P>
<P>An hone&s;t fellow &s;till! &mdash; Clap thy wings, and crow, Jack! &mdash;</P>

<P>WHAT, my deare&s;t creature, have been your &s;uffer|ings!&mdash;What mu&s;t have been your angui&s;h on &s;o di&s;graceful an in&s;ult, committed in the open &s;treets, and in the open day!</P>
<P>No end, I think, of the unde&s;erved calamities of a dear &s;oul, who has been &s;o unhappily driven and betrayed into the hands of a vile libertine! &mdash; How was I &s;hocked at the receiving of your letter written by another hand, and only dictated by you!&mdash;You mu&s;t be very ill. Nor is it to be wondered at. But I hope it is rather from hurry, and &s;urprize, and lowne&s;s, which <HI>may</HI> be over|come, than from a grief given way to, which may be at|tended with effects I cannot bear to think of.</P>
<P>But whatever you do, my dear, you mu&s;t not de&s;pond! Indeed you mu&s;t not de&s;pond! Hitherto you have been in no fault: But de&s;pair would be all your own; and the wor&s;t fault you can be guilty of.</P>
<P>I cannot bear to look upon another hand in&s;tead of yours. My dear creature, &s;end me a few lines, tho' <HI>ever &s;o few,</HI> in your own hand, if po&s;&s;ible.&mdash;For they will revive my heart; e&s;pecially if they can acquaint me of your amended health.</P>
<P>I expect your an&s;wer to my letter of the 13th. We <HI>all</HI> expect it with impatience.</P>
<P>His relations are per&s;ons of <HI>&s;o much</HI> honour&mdash;They are &s;o <HI>very</HI> earne&s;t to rank you among them&mdash;The wretch is &s;o <HI>very</HI> penitent: <HI>Every one</HI> of <HI>his</HI> family &s;ays he is &mdash; <HI>Your own</HI> are &s;o implacable&mdash;Your la&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, tho' the con&s;e|quence of his former villainy, yet neither brought on by

<P>I will inclo&s;e the copy of the letter I wrote to Mi&s;s Montague la&s;t Tue&s;day, on hearing that no-body knew what was become of you; and the an&s;wer to it, under|written and &s;igned by Lord M. and Lady Sarah Sadleir, and Lady Betty Lawrance, as well as by the young ladies &mdash;And al&s;o by the wretch him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I own, that I like not the turn of what he has written to me; and before I will further intere&s;t my&s;elf in his favour, I have determined to inform my&s;elf, by a friend, from his own mouth, of his &s;incerity, and whether his <HI>whole inclination</HI> be in his reque&s;t to me, exclu&s;ive of the <HI>wi&s;hes of his relations.</HI> Yet my heart ri&s;es again&s;t him, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that there is the &s;hadow of a rea&s;on for &s;uch a que&s;tion, the lady Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe. &mdash; But, I think, with my mother, that marriage is now the only means left to make your future life tolerably ea&s;y&mdash;<HI>happy</HI> there is no &s;aying.&mdash;In the eye of the world it&s;elf, his di&s;|graces, in <HI>that</HI> ca&s;e, will be more than yours.&mdash;And to tho&s;e who know you, glorious will be your triumph.</P>
<P>I am obliged to accompany my mother &s;oon to the I&s;le of Wight. My aunt Harman is in a declining way, and in&s;i&s;ts upon &s;eeing us both; and Mr. Hickman too, I think.</P>
<P>His &s;i&s;ter, of whom we had heard &s;o much, with her Lord, were brought t'other day to vi&s;it us. She strangely likes me, or &s;ays &s;he does.</P>
<P>I can't &s;ay, but that I think &s;he an&s;wers the excellent character we have heard of her.</P>
<P>It would be death to me to &s;et out for the little i&s;land, and not &s;ee you fir&s;t: And yet my mother (fond of exert|ing an authority, that &s;he her&s;elf, by that exertion, often brings into que&s;tion) in&s;i&s;ts, that my next vi&s;it to you <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be a congratulatory one, as Mrs. Lovelace.</P>
<P>When I know what will be the re&s;ult of the que&s;tions to be put in my name to that wretch, and what is your mind on my letter of the 13th, I &s;hall tell you more of mine.</P>

<P>YOU oppre&s;s me, my deare&s;t Mi&s;s Howe, by your flaming, yet &s;teady love. I will be very brief, be|cau&s;e I am not well; yet a good deal better than I was; and becau&s;e I am preparing an an&s;wer to yours of the 13th. But, beforehand, I mu&s;t tell you, my dear, I will <HI>not</HI> have that man &mdash; Don't be angry with me. &mdash; But in|deed I won't. So let him be a&s;ked no que&s;tions about me, I be&s;eech you.</P>
<P>I do <HI>not</HI> de&s;pond, my dear. I hope I may &s;ay, <HI>I will</HI> not de&s;pond. Is not my condition greatly mended? I thank Heaven it is!</P>
<P>I am no pri&s;oner now in a vile hou&s;e. I am not now in the power of that man's devices. I am not now obliged to hide my&s;elf in corners for fear of him. One of his intimate companions is become my warm friend, and engages to keep him from me, and that by his own con&s;ent. I am among hone&s;t people. I have all my cloaths and effects re&s;tored me. The wretch him&s;elf bears te&s;timony to my honour.</P>
<P>Indeed I am very weak and ill&punc; But I have an excel|lent phy&s;ician, Dr. H. and as worthy an apothecary, Mr. Goddard.&mdash;Their treatment of me, my dear, is perfectly <HI>paternal!</HI>&mdash;My mind too, I can find, begins to &s;trengthen: And methinks, at times, I find my&s;elf &s;uperior to my calamities.</P>
<P>I &s;hall have &s;inkings &s;ometimes. I mu&s;t expect &s;uch. And my father's maledict&mdash; But you will chide me for introducing that, now I am enumerating my comforts.</P>
<P>But I charge you, my dear, that you do not &s;uffer my calamities to &s;it too heavy upon your own mind: If you do, that will be to new-point &s;ome of tho&s;e arrows, that have been blunted, and lo&s;t their &s;harpne&s;s.</P>

<P>You will think very meanly of your Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe, if you do not believe, that the greate&s;t plea&s;ure &s;he can re|ceive in this life, is in your pro&s;perity and welfare. Think not of me, my only friend, but as we were in times pa&s;t&punc; And &s;uppo&s;e me gone a great, great way off!&mdash;A long journey!&mdash;How often are the deare&s;t of friends, at their country's call, thus parted,&mdash;with a <HI>certainty</HI> for years&mdash; with a <HI>probability</HI> for ever!</P>
<P>Love me &s;till, however. But let it be with a weaning love.

<HEAD>LETTER LI. <HI>Mr.</HI> BELFORD, <HI>To</HI> ROBERT LOVELACE, <ABBR><HI>E&s;q</HI></ABBR> [<HI>In An&s;wer to Letter</HI> xlviii.]</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Thur&s;day, July</HI> 20.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Read that part of your conclu&s;ion to poor Belton&punc; where you inquire after him, and mention how mer|rily you, and the re&s;t, pa&s;s your time at M. Hall. He fetched a deep &s;igh; <HI>You are all very happy!</HI> were his words: &mdash; I am &s;orry they <HI>were</HI> his words; for, poor fellow, he is going very fa&s;t. Change of air, <HI>he</HI> hopes, will mend him, joined to the chearful company I have left him in. But nothing, I dare &s;ay, will.</P>
<P>A con&s;uming malady, and a con&s;uming mi&s;tre&s;s, to an indulgent keeper, are dreadful things to &s;truggle with both together: Violence mu&s;t be u&s;ed to get rid of the latter: and yet he has not &s;pirit left him, to exert him&s;elf. His hou&s;e is Thoma&s;ine's hou&s;e; not his. He has not been within his doors for a fortnight pa&s;t. Vagabonding about from inn to inn; entering each for a bait only; and &s;taying two or three days without power to remove; and hardly knowing which to go to next. His malady is within him; and he cannot run away from it.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="197">Her boys (once he thought them his) are &s;turdy enough to &s;houlder him in his own hou&s;e as they pa&s;s by him. Siding with the mother, they in a manner expel him; and, in his ab&s;ence, riot away on the remnant of his broken fortunes. As to their mother, who was once &s;o tender, &s;o &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, &s;o &s;tudious to oblige, that we all pronounced him happy, and his cour&s;e of life the eligible, &s;he is now &s;o termagant, &s;o in&s;olent, that he cannot con|tend with her, without doing infinite prejudice to his health. A broken-&s;pirited defen&s;ive, <HI>hardly a defen&s;ive,</HI> therefore reduced to: And this to a heart, for &s;o many years waging <HI>offen&s;ive</HI> war (nor valuing whom the oppo|nent), what a reduction!&mdash;Now comparing him&s;elf to the &s;uperannuated lion in the fable, kick'd in the jaws, and laid &s;prawling, by the &s;purning heel of an ignoble a&s;s!</P>
<P>I have undertaken his cau&s;e. He has given me leave, yet not without reluctance, to put him into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his own hou&s;e; and to place in it for him his unhappy &s;i&s;ter, whom he has hitherto &s;lighted, <HI>becau&s;e</HI> unhappy. It is hard, he told me (and wept, poor fellow, when he &s;aid it), that he cannot be permitted to die quietly in his own hou&s;e!&mdash;The fruits of ble&s;&s;ed keeping the&s;e! &mdash;</P>
<P>Tho' but lately appri&s;ed of her infidelity, it now comes out to have been of &s;o long continuance, that he has no room to believe the boys to be his: Yet how fond did he u&s;e to be of them!</P>
<P>If I have occa&s;ion for your a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and that of our compeers, in rein&s;tating the poor fellow, I will give you notice. Mean time, I have ju&s;t now been told, that Thoma&s;ine declares &s;he will not &s;tir: For, it &s;eems, &s;he &s;u&s;pects that mea&s;ures will be fallen upon to make her quit. She is Mrs. Belton, &s;he &s;ays, and will prove her marriage.</P>
<P>If &s;he give her&s;elf the&s;e airs in his life-time, what would &s;he attempt to do after his death?</P>
<P>Her boys threaten any-body, who &s;hall pre&s;ume to in|&s;ult their <HI>mother.</HI> Their <HI>father</HI> (as they <HI>call</HI> poor Belton) they &s;peak of as an unnatural one. And their probably <HI>true father</HI> is for ever there, <HI>ho&s;tilely</HI> there, pa&s;&s;ing for her cou&s;in, as u&s;ual: Now her <HI>protecting cou&s;in.</HI></P>
<P>Hardly ever, I dare &s;ay, was there a keeper, that did not make a keepere&s;s; who lavi&s;h'd away on her kept-fellow,
<PB N="197" REF="198">
what &s;he obtained from the extravagant folly of him who kept her.</P>
<P>I will do without you, if I can. The ca&s;e will be only, as I conceive, like that of the antient Sarmatians, returning, after many years ab&s;ence, to their homes, their wives then in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their &s;laves: So that they had to contend not only with tho&s;e <HI>wives,</HI> con&s;cious of their infidelity, and with their <HI>&s;laves,</HI> but with the <HI>children</HI> of tho&s;e &s;laves, grown up to manhood, re&s;olute to defend their mothers, and their long manumitted fathers. But the noble Sarmatians, &s;corning to attack their &s;laves with equal weapons, only provided them&s;elves with the &s;ame &s;ort of whips, with which they u&s;ed formerly to cha&s;ti&s;e them. And, attacking them with them, the mi&s;creants fled before them.&mdash;In memory of which, to this day, the device on the coin in Novogrod in Ru&s;&s;ia, a city of the antient Sarmatia, is a man on hor&s;eback, with a whip in his hand.</P>
<P>The poor fellow takes it ill, that you did not pre&s;s him more than you did, to be of your party at M. Hall. It is owing to Mowbray, he is &s;ure, that he had &s;o very &s;light an invitation, from one who&s;e invitations u&s;ed to be &s;o warm.</P>
<P>Mowbray's &s;peech to him, he &s;ays, he never will for|give: "Why, Tom," &s;aid the brutal fellow, with a cur&s;e, <Q>thou droope&s;t like a pip or roup-cloaking chicken. Thou &s;hould&s;t grow perter, or &s;ubmit to a &s;olitary qua|rantine, if thou would&s;t not infect the whole brood.</Q></P>
<P>For my own part, only that this poor fellow is in di|&s;tre&s;s, as well in his affairs, as in his mind, or I &s;hould be &s;ick of you all. Such is the reli&s;h I have of the con|ver&s;ation, and &s;uch my admiration of the deportment and &s;entiments of this divine lady, that I would forego a month, even of thy company, to be admitted into hers but for one hour: And I am highly in conceit with my|&s;elf, greatly as I u&s;ed to value <HI>thine,</HI> for being able, &s;pon|taneou&s;ly, as I may &s;ay, to make this preference.</P>
<P>It is, after all, a devili&s;h life we have lived. And to con&s;ider how it all ends in a very few years: To &s;ee what a &s;tate of ill health this poor fellow is &s;o &s;oon reduced to: And then to ob&s;erve how every one of ye run away from
<PB N="198" REF="199">
the unhappy being, as rats from a falling hou&s;e&punc; is fine comfort to help a man to look back upon companions ill-cho&s;en, and a life mi&s;-&s;pent!</P>
<P>For my own part, if I can get &s;ome good family to credit me with a &s;i&s;ter or a daughter, as I have now an increa&s;ed fortune, which will enable me to propo&s;e hand&s;ome &s;ettle|ments, I will de&s;ert ye all; marry, and live a life of rea|&s;on, rather than a life of brute, for the time to come.</P>

<P>I Was forced to take back my twenty guineas. How the women managed it, I can't tell (I &s;uppo&s;e too readily found a purcha&s;er for the rich &s;uit); but &s;he mi&s;|tru&s;ted, that I was the advancer of the money; and would not let the cloaths go. But Mrs. Lovick has actually &s;old, for fifteen guineas, &s;ome rich lace, worth three times the &s;um: Out of which &s;he repaid her the money &s;he bor|rowed for fees to the doctor, in an illne&s;s occa&s;ioned by the barbarity of the mo&s;t &s;avage of men. <HI>Thou kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">we&s;t his name!</HI></P>
<P>The Doctor called on her in the morning, it &s;eems, and had a &s;hort debate with her about fees. She in&s;i&s;ted, that he &s;hould take one every time he came, write or not write; mi&s;tru&s;ting, that he only gave verbal directions to Mrs. Lovick, or the nur&s;e, to avoid taking any.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, That it would have been impo&s;&s;ible for him, had he <HI>not</HI> been a phy&s;ician, to forbear inquiries after the health and welfare of &s;o excellent a per&s;on. He had not the thought of paying her a compliment in declining the offer'd fee: But he knew her ca&s;e could not &s;o &s;uddenly vary, as to demand his daily vi&s;its. She mu&s;t permit him, therefore, to inquire after her health of the women be|low; and he mu&s;t not think of coming up, if he were to be <HI>pecuniarily</HI> rewarded for the &s;atisfaction he was &s;o de&s;irous to give him&s;elf.</P>
<P>It ended in a compromi&s;e for a fee each other time: Which &s;he unwillingly &s;ubmitted to; telling him, that tho' &s;he was at pre&s;ent de&s;olate and in di&s;grace, yet her cir|cum&s;tances
<PB N="199" REF="200">
were, of right, high; and no expences could ri&s;e &s;o, as to be &s;crupled, whether &s;he lived or died.

<P>I hope thou wilt make thy&s;elf acquainted with this worthy doctor, when thou come&s;t to town; and give him thy thanks, for putting her into conceit with the Sex that thou ha&s;t given her &s;o much rea&s;on to execrate.</P>

<P>This was pretty rough, thou'lt &s;ay: But there's nothing like balking the&s;e formali&s;ts at fir&s;t. When they're put out of their road, they are filled with doubts of them|&s;elves, and can never get into it again: So that an

hone&s;t fellow, impertinently attacked, as I was, has all the game in his own hand, quite thro' the conference.</P>
<P>He &s;troak'd his chin, and hardly knew what to &s;ay. At la&s;t, after parenthe&s;is within parenthe&s;is, apologizing for apologies, in imitation, I &s;uppo&s;e, of Swift's Digre&s;|&s;ions in Prai&s;e of Digre&s;&s;ions,&mdash;I pre&s;ume, I pre&s;ume, Sir, you were privy to the vi&s;it made to Mi&s;s Howe by the young ladies your cou&s;ins, in the name of Lord M. and Lady Sarah Sadleir, and Lady Betty Lawrance?</P>
<P>I <HI>was,</HI> Sir: And Mi&s;s Howe had a letter afterwards, &s;igned by his Lord&s;hip and tho&s;e Ladies, and underwrit|ten by my&s;elf. Have you &s;een it, Sir?</P>
<P>I can't &s;ay but I have. It is the principal cau&s;e of this vi&s;it: For Mi&s;s Howe thinks your part of it is written with &s;uch an air of levity&mdash;Pardon me, Sir,&mdash;that &s;he knows not whether you are in earne&s;t, or not, in your addre&s;s to <HI>her</HI> for her intere&s;t to her <HI>friend</HI> <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See p. <HI>135&punc;</HI> of this Volume.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Will Mi&s;s Howe permit me to explain my&s;elf in per&s;on to her, Mr. Hickman?</P>
<P>O Sir, by no means: Mi&s;s Howe, I am &s;ure, would not give you that trouble.</P>
<P>I &s;hould not think it a trouble. I will mo&s;t readily at|tend you, Sir, to Mi&s;s Howe, and &s;atisfy her in all her &s;cruples. Come, Sir, I will wait upon you now. You have a chariot. Are alone. We can talk as we ride.</P>
<P>He he&s;itated, wriggled, winced, &s;troaked his ruffles, &s;et his wig, and pulled his neckcloth, which was long enough for a bib&mdash;I am not going directly back to Mi&s;s Howe, Sir. It will be as well, if you will be &s;o good as to &s;atisfy Mi&s;s Howe by me.</P>
<P>What is it &s;he &s;cruples, Mr. Hickman?</P>
<P>Why, Sir, Mi&s;s Howe ob&s;erves, that in your part of the letter, you &s;ay&mdash;But let me &s;ee, Sir: I have a copy of what you wrote&mdash;Pulling it out&mdash;Will you give me leave, Sir?&mdash;Thus you begin&mdash;<HI>Dear Mi&s;s Howe</HI> &mdash;</P>
<P>No offence, I hope, Mr. Hickman?</P>
<P>None in the lea&s;t, Sir!&mdash;None at all, Sir!&mdash;Taking aim, as it were to read.</P>
<P>Do you u&s;e &s;pectacles, Mr. Hickman?</P>
<P><HI>Spectacles,</HI> Sir! His whole broad face lifted up at me:
<PB N="201" REF="202">
Spectacles!&mdash;What makes you a&s;k me &s;uch a que&s;tion? Such a young man as I u&s;e &s;pectacles, Sir!&mdash;</P>
<P>They do in Spain, Mr. Hickman; young as well as old; to &s;ave their eyes. &mdash; Have you ever read Prior's <HI>Alma,</HI> Mr. Hickman?</P>
<P>I have, Sir:&mdash;<HI>Cu&s;tom</HI> is every-thing in nations, as well as with individuals: I know the meaning of your que|&s;tion.&mdash;But 'tis not the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> cu&s;tom.&mdash;</P>
<P>Was you ever in Spain, Mr. Hickman?</P>
<P>No, Sir: I have been in Holland.</P>
<P>In Holland, Sir!&mdash;Never in France or Italy?&mdash;I was re&s;olved to travel with him into the land of <HI>Puzzledom.</HI></P>
<P>No, Sir, I cannot &s;ay I have, as yet.</P>
<P>That's a wonder, Sir, when on the continent!</P>
<P>I went on a particular affair: I was obliged to return &s;oon.</P>
<P>Well, Sir; you was going to read&mdash;Pray be plea&s;ed to proceed.</P>
<P>Again he took aim, as if his eyes were older than the re&s;t of him; and read, <HI>After what is written above, and &s;igned by names and characters of &s;uch unque&s;tionable honour</HI>&mdash;To be &s;ure, taking off his eye, no-body que&s;tions the honour of Lord M. nor that of the good ladies, who &s;igned the letter.</P>
<P>I hope, Mr. Hickman, no-body que&s;tions mine neither?</P>
<P>If you plea&s;e, Sir, I will read on:&mdash;<HI>I might have been excu&s;ed &s;igning a name, almo&s;t as hateful to my&s;elf</HI> [You are plea&s;ed to &s;ay], <HI>as I KNOW it is to</HI> YOU &mdash;</P>
<P>Well, Mr. Hickman, I mu&s;t interrupt you at this place. In what I wrote to Mi&s;s Howe, I di&s;tingui&s;h'd the word KNOW. I had a rea&s;on for it. Mi&s;s Howe has been very free with my character. I have never done her any harm. I take it very ill of her. And I hope, Sir, you come in her name to make excu&s;es for it.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Howe, Sir, is a very polite young lady. She is not accu&s;tomed to treat any gentleman's character unbe|comingly.</P>
<P>Then <HI>I</HI> have the more rea&s;on to take it ami&s;s, Mr. Hickman.</P>
<P>Why, Sir, you know the friend&s;hip &mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="203">No friend&s;hip &s;hould warrant &s;uch freedoms as Mi&s;s Howe has taken with my character.</P>
<P>I believe he began to wi&s;h he had not come near me. He &s;eemed quite di&s;concerted.</P>
<P>Have you not heard Mi&s;s Howe treat my name with great &mdash;</P>
<P>Sir, I come not to offend or affront you: But you know what a love there is between Mi&s;s Howe and Mi&s;s Harlowe.&mdash;I doubt, Sir, you have not treated Mi&s;s Har|lowe, as &s;o fine a young lady de&s;erved to be treated: And if love for her friend has made Mi&s;s Howe take freedoms, as you call them, a generous mind, on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, will rather be &s;orry for having given the <HI>cau&s;e,</HI> than&mdash;</P>
<P>I know your con&s;equence, Sir!&mdash;But I'd rather have this reproof from a lady, than from a gentleman. I have a great de&s;ire to wait upon Mi&s;s Howe. I am per&s;uaded we &s;hould &s;oon come to a good under&s;tanding. Generous minds are always of kin. I know we &s;hould agree in every-thing. Pray, Mr. Hickman, be &s;o kind as to in|troduce me to Mi&s;s Howe.</P>
<P>Sir&mdash;I can &s;ignify your de&s;ire, if you plea&s;e, to Mi&s;s Howe.</P>
<P>Do &s;o. Be plea&s;ed to read on, Mr. Hickman.</P>
<P>He did very formally, as if I remembered not what I had written; and when he came to the pa&s;&s;age about the halter, the par&s;on, and the hangman, reading it, Why, Sir, &s;ays he, does not this look like a je&s;t?&mdash;Mi&s;s Howe thinks it does. It is not in the lady's <HI>power,</HI> you know, Sir, to doom you to the gallows.</P>
<P>Then, if it were, Mr. Hickman, you think &s;he would?</P>
<P>You &s;ay here to Mi&s;s Howe, proceeded he, that Mi&s;s Harlowe is the <HI>mo&s;t injured of her &s;ex.</HI> I know from Mi&s;s Howe&punc; that &s;he highly re&s;ents the injuries you own: In|&s;omuch that Mi&s;s Howe doubts that &s;he &s;hall ever prevail upon her to overlook them: And as your family are all de&s;irous you &s;hould repair her wrongs, and likewi&s;e de&s;ire Mi&s;s Howe's interpo&s;ition with her friend; Mi&s;s Howe fears, from this part of your letter, that you are too much in je&s;t; and that your offer to do her ju&s;tice, is rather in compliment to your friends intreaties, than proceeding from your own inclinations: And &s;he de&s;ires to know
<PB N="203" REF="204">
your true &s;entiments on this occa&s;ion, before &s;he interpo&s;es further.</P>
<P>Do you think, Mr. Hickman, that, if I am capable of deceiving my own relations, I have &s;o much obligation to Mi&s;s Howe, who has always treated me with great free|dom, as to acknowlege to <HI>her,</HI> what I don't to <HI>them?</HI></P>
<P>Sir, I beg pardon: &mdash; But Mi&s;s Howe thinks, that, as you have written to her, &s;he may a&s;k you, by me, for an explanation of what you have written.</P>
<P>You &s;ee, Mr. Hickman, &s;omething of me. &mdash; Do <HI>you</HI> think I am in je&s;t, or in earne&s;t?</P>
<P>I &s;ee, Sir, you are a gay gentleman, of fine &s;pirits, and all That &mdash; All I beg in Mi&s;s Howe's name, is, to know, if you really, and <HI>bona fide,</HI> join with your friends, in de&s;iring her to u&s;e her intere&s;t to reconcile you to Mi&s;s Harlowe?</P>
<P>I &s;hould be extremely glad to be reconciled to Mi&s;s Harlowe; and &s;hould owe great obligations to Mi&s;s Howe, if &s;he could bring about &s;o happy an event.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, and you have no objections to marriage, I pre&s;ume, as the terms of that reconciliation?</P>
<P>I never liked matrimony in my life. I mu&s;t be plain with you, Mr. Hickman.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry for it: I think it a very happy &s;tate:</P>
<P>I hope you will find it &s;o, Mr. Hickman.</P>
<P>I doubt not but I &s;hall, Sir. And I dare &s;ay, &s;o would you, if you were to have Mi&s;s Harlowe.</P>
<P>If I could be happy in it with any-body, it would be with Mi&s;s Harlowe.</P>
<P>I am &s;urpri&s;ed, Sir!&mdash;Then, after all, you don't think of marrying Mi&s;s Harlowe!&mdash;After the hard u&s;age&mdash;</P>
<P>What hard u&s;age, Mr. Hickman? I don't doubt but a lady of her nicene&s;s has repre&s;ented what would appear trifles to any other, in a very &s;trong light.</P>
<P>If what I have had hinted to me, Sir&mdash;Excu&s;e me&mdash; has been offered to the lady, &s;he has more than trifles to complain of.</P>
<P>Let me know what you have heard, Mr. Hickman? I will very truly an&s;wer to the accu&s;ations.</P>
<P>Sir, you know be&s;t what you have done: You own the lady is the <HI>mo&s;t injured, as well as the mo&s;t de&s;erving, of her &s;ex.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="205">I do, Sir; and yet, I would be glad to know what you have <HI>heard;</HI> for on that, perhaps, depends my an&s;wer to the que&s;tions Mi&s;s Howe puts to me by you.</P>
<P>Why then, Sir, &s;ince you a&s;k it, you cannot be di&s;|plea&s;ed if I an&s;wer you:&mdash;In the fir&s;t place, Sir, you will acknowlege, I &s;uppo&s;e, that you promi&s;ed Mi&s;s Harlowe Marriage, and all That?</P>
<P>Well, Sir, and I &s;uppo&s;e what you have to charge me with, is, That I was de&s;irous to have <HI>all That,</HI> without marriage.</P>
<P>Cot-&s;o, Sir, I know you are deemed to be a man of wit: But may I not a&s;k, if the&s;e things &s;it not too light upon you?</P>
<P>When a thing is done, and cannot be helped, 'tis right to make the be&s;t of it. I wi&s;h the lady would think &s;o too.</P>
<P>I think, Sir, ladies &s;hould not be deceived. I think a promi&s;e to a lady &s;hould be as binding as to any other per&s;on, at the lea&s;t.</P>
<P>I <HI>believe</HI> you think &s;o, Mr. Hickman: And I believe you are a very hone&s;t good &s;ort of a man.</P>
<P>I would always keep my word, Sir, whether to man or woman.</P>
<P>You &s;ay well. And far be it from me to per&s;uade you to do otherwi&s;e. But what have you farther heard?</P>
<P>Thou wilt think, Jack, I mu&s;t be very de&s;irous to know in what light my elected &s;pou&s;e had repre&s;ented things to Mi&s;s Howe; and how far Mi&s;s Howe had communicated them to Mr. Hickman.</P>
<P>Sir, this is no part of my pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>But, Mr. Hickman, 'tis part of mine. I hope you would not expect, that I &s;hould an&s;wer <HI>your</HI> que&s;tions, at the &s;ame time that you refu&s;e to an&s;wer <HI>mine.</HI> What, pray, have you farther heard?</P>
<P>Why then, Sir, if I mu&s;t &s;ay, I am told, that Mi&s;s Harlowe was carried to a very bad hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Why, indeed, the people did not prove &s;o good as they &s;hould be&punc;&mdash;What farther have you heard?</P>
<P>I have heard, Sir, that the lady had &s;trange advantages taken of her, very <HI>unfair</HI> ones; but what I cannot &s;ay.</P>
<P>And <HI>cannot</HI> you &s;ay? Cannot you <HI>gue&s;s?</HI> Then I'll tell you, Sir. Perhaps &s;ome liberty was taken with her,
<PB N="205" REF="206">
when &s;he was a&s;leep. Do you think no lady ever was taken at &s;uch an advantage?&mdash;You know, Mr. Hickman, that ladies are very &s;hy of tru&s;ting them&s;elves with the mode&s;te&s;t of our &s;ex, when they are di&s;po&s;ed to &s;leep; and why &s;o, if they did not <HI>expect,</HI> that advantages would be taken of them at &s;uch times?</P>
<P>But, Sir, had not the lady &s;omething given her to make her &s;leep?</P>
<P>Ay, Mr. Hickman, that's the que&s;tion: I want to know if the lady &s;ays &s;he had?</P>
<P>I have not &s;een all &s;he has written; but by what I have heard, it is a very black affair&mdash;Excu&s;e me, Sir.</P>
<P>I do excu&s;e you, Mr. Hickman: But, &s;uppo&s;ing it were &s;o, do you think a lady was never impo&s;ed upon by wine, or &s;o? &mdash; Do you think the mo&s;t cautious woman in the world might not be cheated by a &s;tronger liquor, for a &s;maller, when &s;he was thir&s;ty, after a fatigue in this very warm weather? And do you think, if &s;he was thus thrown into a profound &s;leep, that &s;he is the only lady that was ever taken at &s;uch advantage?</P>
<P>Even as you make it, Mr. Lovelace, this matter is not a light one. But I fear it is a great deal heavier than as you put it.</P>
<P>What rea&s;ons have you to fear this, Sir? What has the lady &s;aid? Pray, let me know. I have <HI>rea&s;on</HI> to be &s;o earne&s;t.</P>
<P>Why, Sir, Mi&s;s Howe her&s;elf knows not the whole. The lady promi&s;es to give her all the particulars, at a proper time, if &s;he lives; but has &s;aid enough to make it out to be a very bad affair.</P>
<P>I am glad Mi&s;s Harlowe has not yet given all the par|ticulars. And, &s;ince &s;he has not, you may tell Mi&s;s Howe from me, That neither &s;he, nor any lady in the world, can be more virtuous than Mi&s;s Harlowe is to this hour, as to her own mind. Tell her, that I hope &s;he never <HI>will</HI> know the particulars; but that &s;he has been unworthily u&s;ed: Tell her, that tho' I know not what &s;he has &s;aid, yet I have &s;uch an opinion of her veracity, that I would blindly &s;ub&s;cribe to the truth of every tittle of it, tho' it make me ever &s;o black. Tell her, that I have but <HI>three</HI> things to blame her for: <HI>One,</HI> That &s;he won't give me an
<PB N="206" REF="207">
opportunity of repairing her wrongs: The <HI>Second,</HI> That &s;he is &s;o ready to acquaint every-body with what &s;he has &s;uffered, that it will put it out of my power to redre&s;s tho&s;e wrongs, with any tolerable reputation to either of us. Will this, Mr. Hickman, an&s;wer any part of the in|tention of this vi&s;it?</P>
<P>Why, Sir, this is talking like a man of honour, I own. But you &s;ay there is a <HI>Third</HI> thing you blame the lady for; may I a&s;k what That is?</P>
<P>I don't know, Sir, whether I ought to tell it you, or not. Perhaps you won't believe it, if I do. But tho' the lady will tell the <HI>truth,</HI> and nothing <HI>but</HI> the truth, yet, perhaps, &s;he will not tell the <HI>whole</HI> truth.</P>
<P>Pray, Sir&mdash;But it mayn't be proper: &mdash; Yet you give me great curio&s;ity: Sure there is no mi&s;conduct in the lady. I hope there is not. I am &s;ure, if Mi&s;s Howe did not believe her to be faultle&s;s in every particular, &s;he would not intere&s;t her&s;elf &s;o much in her favour as &s;he does, dearly as &s;he loves her.</P>
<P>I love the lady too well, Mr. Hickman, to wi&s;h to le&s;&s;en her in Mi&s;s Howe's opinion; e&s;pecially as &s;he is abandoned of every other friend. But, perhaps, it would hardly be credited, if I &s;hould tell you.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be very &s;orry, Sir, and &s;o would Mi&s;s Howe, if this poor lady's conduct had laid her under obligation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to you for this re&s;erve. &mdash; You have &s;o much the appear|ance of a gentleman, as well as are &s;o much di&s;tingui&s;hed in your family and fortunes, that I hope you are incapa|ble of loading &s;uch a young lady as this, in order to lighten your&s;elf.&mdash;Excu&s;e me, Sir.</P>
<P>I do, I do, Mr. Hickman. You &s;ay, you came not with any intention to affront me. I take freedom, and I give it.&mdash;I &s;hould be very loth, I repeat, to &s;ay any-thing, that may weaken Mi&s;s Harlowe in the good opinion of the only friend &s;he thinks &s;he has left.</P>
<P>It may not be proper, &s;aid he, for me to know your <HI>third</HI> article again&s;t this unhappy lady: But I never heard of any body, out of her own implacable family, that had the lea&s;t doubt of her honour. Mrs. Howe, indeed, once &s;aid, after a conference with one of her uncles, that &s;he feared all was not right of her &s;ide.&mdash;But el&s;e, I never heard&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="208">Oons, Sir, in a fierce tone, and with an erect mien, &s;topping &s;hort upon him, which made him &s;tart back&mdash; 'Tis next to bla&s;phemy to que&s;tion the lady's honour. She is more pure than a ve&s;tal; for ve&s;tals have been often warmed by their own fires. No age, from the fir&s;t to the pre&s;ent, ever produced, nor will the future, to the end of the world, I dare averr, ever produce, a young bloom|ing lady, tried as &s;he has been tried, who has &s;tood all tri|als, as &s;he has done.&mdash; Let me tell you, Sir, That you never &s;aw, never knew, never heard of, &s;uch another lady, as Mi&s;s Harlowe.</P>
<P>Sir, Sir, I beg your pardon. Far be it from me to que&s;tion the lady. You have not heard me &s;ay a word, that could be &s;o con&s;trued. I have the utmo&s;t honour for her. Mi&s;s Howe loves her, as &s;he loves her own &s;oul; and that &s;he would not do, if &s;he were not &s;ure &s;he were as virtuous as her&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>As her&s;elf,</HI> Sir!&mdash;I have a high opinion of Mi&s;s Howe, Sir&mdash;But, I dare &s;ay&mdash;</P>
<P>What, Sir, dare you &s;ay of Mi&s;s Howe?&mdash;I hope, Sir, you will not pre&s;ume to &s;ay any-thing to the di&s;parage|ment of Mi&s;s Howe!</P>
<P><HI>Pre&s;ume,</HI> Mr. Hickman!&mdash;That is <HI>pre&s;uming</HI> language, let me tell you, Mr. Hickman!</P>
<P>The <HI>occa&s;ion</HI> for it, Mr. Lovelace, if de&s;igned, is <HI>pre|&s;uming,</HI> if you plea&s;e.&mdash;I am not a man ready to take of|fence, Sir&mdash;E&s;pecially where I am employed as a medi|ator. But no man breathing &s;hall &s;ay di&s;paraging things of Mi&s;s Howe, in my hearing, without ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Well &s;aid, Mr. Hickman. I di&s;like not your &s;pirit, on &s;uch a <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> occa&s;ion. But what I was going to &s;ay is this, That there is not, in my opinion, a woman in the world, who ought to compare her&s;elf with Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe, till &s;he has &s;tood <HI>her</HI> trials, and has behaved <HI>under</HI> them, and <HI>after</HI> them, as &s;he has done. You &s;ee, Sir, I &s;peak again&s;t my&s;elf. You &s;ee&punc; I do. For, liber|tine as I am thought to be, I never will attempt to bring down the mea&s;ures of right and wrong to the &s;tandard of my actions.</P>
<P>Why, Sir, this is very right. It is very <HI>noble,</HI> I will &s;ay. But 'tis pity&mdash;Excu&s;e me, Sir&mdash;'tis pity, that the
<PB N="208" REF="209">
man who can pronounce &s;o fine a &s;entence, will not &s;quare his actions accordingly.</P>
<P>That, Mr. Hickman, is another point. We all err in &s;ome things. I wi&s;h not that Mi&s;s Howe &s;hould have Mi&s;s Harlowe's trials: And I rejoice, that &s;he is in no danger of any &s;uch from &s;o good a man.</P>
<P>Poor Hickman!&mdash; He looked as if he knew not whe|ther I meant a compliment or a reflection!</P>
<P>But, proceeded I, &s;ince I find that I have excited your curio&s;ity, that you may not go away with a doubt that may be injurious to the mo&s;t admirable of women, I am inclined to hint to you, what I have in the <HI>third</HI> place to blame her for.</P>
<P>Sir, as you plea&s;e&mdash;It may not be proper &mdash;</P>
<P>It cannot be very <HI>improper,</HI> Mr. Hickman&mdash;So let me a&s;k you, What would Mi&s;s Howe think, if her friend is the <HI>more</HI> determined again&s;t me, becau&s;e &s;he thinks (in re|venge to me, I verily believe that!) of encouraging an|other lover?</P>
<P>How, Sir!&mdash; Sure this cannot be the ca&s;e!&mdash; I can tell you, Sir, if Mi&s;s Howe thought this, &s;he would not ap|prove of it at all: For, little as you think Mi&s;s Howe likes you, Sir, and little as &s;he approves of your actions by her friend, I know &s;he is of opinion, that &s;he ought to have no-body living, but you: And &s;hould continue &s;ingle all her life, if &s;he be not yours.</P>
<P>Revenge and ob&s;tinacy, Mr. Hickman, will make wo|men, the be&s;t of them, do very unaccountable things.&mdash; Rather than not put out both eyes of the man they are offended with, they will give up one of their own.</P>
<P>I don't know what to &s;ay to this, Sir: But, &s;ure, &s;he cannot encourage any other per&s;on's addre&s;s! &mdash; So &s;oon too&mdash;Why, Sir, &s;he is, as we are told, &s;o ill, and &s;o <HI>weak</HI> &mdash;</P>
<P>Not in re&s;entment weak, I'll a&s;&s;ure you. I am well acquainted with all her movements&mdash;And I tell you, be|lieve it, or not, that &s;he refu&s;es <HI>me</HI> in view of <HI>another</HI> lover.</P>
<P>Can it be?</P>
<P>'Tis true, by my &s;oul!&mdash;Has &s;he not hinted This to Mi&s;s Howe, do you think?</P>
<P>No indeed, Sir. If &s;he had, I &s;hould not have trou|bled you, at this time, from Mi&s;s Howe.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="210">Well then, you &s;ee I am right: That tho' &s;he cannot be guilty of a fal&s;hood, yet &s;he has not told her friend the whole truth.</P>
<P>What &s;hall a man &s;ay to the&s;e things! looking mo&s;t &s;tupidly perplexed.</P>
<P><HI>Say! &s;ay,</HI> Mr. Hickman!&mdash; Who can account for the workings and ways of a pa&s;&s;ionate and offended lady? Endle&s;s would be the hi&s;tories I could give you, within my own knowlege, of the dreadful effects of womens pa&s;|&s;ionate re&s;entments, and what that Sex will do; when di&s;|appointed. But can there be a &s;tronger in&s;tance than this, of &s;uch a per&s;on as Mi&s;s Harlowe, who, at this very in|&s;tant, and ill as &s;he is, not only encourages, but, in a manner, makes court to, one of the mo&s;t odious dogs that ever was &s;een? I think Mi&s;s Howe &s;hould not be told this. And yet &s;he ought too, in order to di&s;&s;uade her from &s;uch a prepo&s;terous ra&s;hne&s;s.</P>
<P>O fie! O &s;trange! Mi&s;s Howe knows nothing of this! To be &s;ure &s;he won't look upon her, if this be true!</P>
<P>'Tis true, very true, Mr. Hickman! True as I am here to tell you &s;o! &mdash; And he is an ugly fellow too; ug|lier to look at than me.</P>
<P>Than <HI>you,</HI> Sir! Why, to be &s;ure, you are one of the hand&s;ome&s;t men in England.</P>
<P>Well, but the wretch &s;he &s;o &s;pitefully prefers to me is a mi&s;hapen, meager varlet; more like a &s;keleton than a man! Then he dre&s;&s;es&mdash;you never &s;aw a devil &s;o bedi|zened! Hardly a coat to his back, nor a &s;hoe to his foot: A bald-pated villain, yet grudges to buy a peruke to hide his baldne&s;s: For he is as covetous as hell, never &s;atisfied, yet plaguy rich.</P>
<P>Why, Sir, there is &s;ome joke in this, &s;urely. A man of common parts knows not how to take &s;uch gentlemen as you. But, Sir, if there be any truth in the &s;tory, what is he? Some Jew, or mi&s;erly citizen, I &s;uppo&s;e, that may have pre&s;umed on the lady's di&s;tre&s;sful circum&s;tances; and your lively wit points him out as it plea&s;es.</P>
<P>Why the ra&s;cal has e&s;tates in every county <HI>in</HI> England, and <HI>out of</HI> England too.</P>
<P>Some Ea&s;t-India governor, I &s;uppo&s;e, if there be any-thing in it. The lady once had thoughts of going abroad.
<PB N="210" REF="211">
But, I fancy, all this time you are in je&s;t, Sir. If not, we mu&s;t &s;urely have heard of him&mdash;</P>
<P>Heard of him! Ay, Sir, we have all heard of him&mdash; But none of us care to be intimate with him&mdash;except this lady&mdash;and that, as I told you, in &s;pite to me&mdash;His name, in &s;hort, is DEATH!&mdash;DEATH, Sir, &s;tamping, and &s;peaking loud, and full in his ear; which made him jump half a yard high.</P>
<P>Thou never behelde&s;t any man &s;o di&s;concerted. He looked as if the frightful &s;keleton was before him, and he had not his accounts ready. When a little recovered, he fribbled with his wai&s;tcoat buttons, as if he had been tell|ing his beads.</P>
<P>This, Sir, proceeded I, is her wooer!&mdash;Nay, &s;he is &s;o forward a girl, that &s;he <HI>wooes him:</HI> But I hope it never will be a match.</P>
<P>He had before behaved, and now looked, with more &s;pirit than I expected from him.</P>
<P>I came, Sir, &s;aid he, as a mediator of differences. It behoves me to keep my temper. But, Sir, and turned &s;hort upon me, as much as I love peace, and to promote it, I will not be ill-u&s;ed.</P>
<P>As I had played &s;o much upon him, it would have been wrong to take him at his <HI>more</HI> than half-menace: Yet, I think, I owe him a grudge, for his pre&s;uming to addre&s;s Mi&s;s Howe.</P>
<P>You mean no defiance, I pre&s;ume, Mr. Hickman, any more than I do offence. On that pre&s;umption, I a&s;k your excu&s;e. But This is my way. I mean no harm. I can|not let &s;orrow touch my heart. I cannot be grave &s;ix minutes together, for the blood of me. I am a de&s;cend|ent of old Chancellor More, I believe; and &s;hould not forbear to cut a joke, were I upon the &s;caffold. But you may gather, from what I have <HI>&s;aid,</HI> that I prefer Mi&s;s Harlowe, and that upon the ju&s;te&s;t grounds, to all the wo|men in the world: And I wonder, that there &s;hould be any difficulty to believe, from what I have &s;igned, and from what I have promi&s;ed to my relations, and enabled them to promi&s;e for me, that I &s;hould be glad to marry that excellent lady, upon her own terms. I acknowlege to you, Mr. Hickman, that I have ba&s;ely injured her. If
<PB N="211" REF="212">
&s;he will honour me with her hand, I declare, that it is my intention to make her the be&s;t of hu&s;bands. But, never|thele&s;s, I mu&s;t &s;ay, that, if &s;he goes on appealing her ca&s;e, and expo&s;ing us both, as &s;he does, it is impo&s;&s;ible to think the knot can be knit, with reputation to either. And al|tho', Mr. Hickman, I have delivered my apprehen&s;ions under &s;o ludicrous a figure, I am afraid, that &s;he will ruin her con&s;titution; and, by &s;eeking death when &s;he may &s;hun him, will not be able to avoid him when &s;he would be glad to do &s;o.</P>
<P>This cool and hone&s;t &s;peech let down his &s;tiffened mu&s;|cles into complacency. He was my very obedient and faithful humble &s;ervant &s;everal times over, as I waited on him to his chariot: And I was his almo&s;t as often.</P>
<P>And &s;o <HI>Exit</HI> Hickman.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Friday night, July</HI> 21.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I WILL throw away a few paragraphs upon the con|tents of thy la&s;t &s;hocking letters, ju&s;t brought me; and &s;end what I &s;hall write by the fellow who carries mine on the interview with Hickman.</P>
<P>Reformation, I &s;ee, is coming fa&s;t upon thee. Thy uncle's &s;low death, and thy attendance upon him, thro' every &s;tage towards it, prepared thee for it. But go thou on in thy own way, as I will in mine. Happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in being plea&s;ed with what we do: And if thou can&s;t find delight in being <HI>&s;ad,</HI> it will be as well for thee, as if thou wert <HI>merry,</HI> tho' no other per&s;on &s;hould join to keep thee in countenance.</P>
<P>I am, neverthele&s;s, exceedingly di&s;turbed at the lady's ill health. It is intirely owing to the cur&s;ed arre&s;t. She was ab&s;olutely triumphant over me, and the whole crew, before. Thou believe&s;t me guiltle&s;s of That: So, I hope, does &s;he. &mdash; The re&s;t, as I have often &s;aid, is a common ca&s;e; only a little uncommonly circum&s;tanced; that's all: Why, then, all the&s;e &s;evere things from her and thee?</P>
<P>As to &s;elling her cloaths, and her laces, and &s;o forth,
<PB N="212" REF="213">
it has, I own, a &s;hocking &s;ound with it. What an im|placable, as well as unju&s;t, &s;et of wretches are tho&s;e of her unkindredly kin; who have money of hers in their hands, as well as large arrears of her own e&s;tate; yet with|hold both, <HI>avowedly</HI> to di&s;tre&s;s her! But may &s;he not have money of that proud and &s;aucy friend of hers, Mi&s;s Howe, more than &s;he wants? &mdash; And &s;hould I not be overjoyed, think&s;t thou, to &s;erve her?&mdash;What then is there in the parting with her apparel, but female perver&s;ene&s;s?&mdash;And I am not &s;ure, whether I ought not to be glad, if &s;he does this out of <HI>&s;pite to me.</HI>&mdash;Some di&s;appointed fair-ones would have hanged, &s;ome drowned, them&s;elves. My beloved only revenges her&s;elf upon her cloaths. Different ways of working has pa&s;&s;ion in different bo&s;oms, as humour and complexion induce.&mdash;Be&s;ides, do&s;t think I &s;hall grudge to replace, to three times the value, what &s;he di&s;po&s;es of? So, Jack, there is no great matter in this.</P>
<P>Thou &s;ee&s;t how &s;en&s;ible &s;he is of the &s;oothings of the polite Doctor: This will enable thee to judge how dread|fully the horrid arre&s;t, and her gloomy father's cur&s;e, mu&s;t have hurt her. I have great hope, if &s;he will but &s;ee me, that my behaviour, my contrition, my &s;oothings, may have &s;ome happy effects upon her.</P>
<P>But thou art too ready to give me up. Let me &s;eriou&s;ly tell thee, that, all excellence as &s;he is, I think the earne&s;t interpo&s;ition of my relations; the implored mediation of that little fury Mi&s;s Howe; and the commi&s;&s;ions thou act|e&s;t under from my&s;elf; are &s;uch in&s;tances of conde&s;cen|&s;ion and high value in <HI>them,</HI> and &s;uch contrition in <HI>me,</HI> that nothing farther can be done.&mdash;So here let the matter re&s;t for the pre&s;ent, till &s;he con&s;iders better of it.</P>
<P>But now a few words upon poor Belton's ca&s;e. I own I was, at fir&s;t, a little &s;tartled at the infidelity of his Tho|ma&s;ine: Her hypocri&s;y to be for &s;o many years undetect|ed!&mdash;I have very lately had &s;ome intimations given me of her vilene&s;s; and had intended to mention it to thee; when I &s;aw thee. To &s;ay the truth, I always &s;u&s;pected her <HI>eye:</HI> The <HI>eye,</HI> thou knowe&s;t, is the <HI>ca&s;ement,</HI> at which the <HI>heart</HI> generally looks out. Many a woman, who will not &s;hew her&s;elf at the <HI>door,</HI> has tipt the &s;ly, the intelligible <HI>win<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> from the <HI>windows.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="214">But Tom had no management at all. A very carele&s;s fellow. Would never look into his own affairs. The e&s;tate his uncle left him was his ruin: Wife, or mi&s;tre&s;s, whoever was, mu&s;t have had his fortune to &s;port with.</P>
<P>I have often hinted his weakne&s;&s;es of this &s;ort to him; and the danger he was in of becoming the property of de|&s;igning people. But he hated to take pains. He would ever run away from his accounts; as now, poor fellow! he would be glad to do from him&s;elf. Had he not had a <HI>woman</HI> to fleece him, his <HI>coachman,</HI> or <HI>valet,</HI> would have been his <HI>prime mini&s;ter,</HI> and done it as effectually.</P>
<P>But yet, for many years I thought &s;he was true to his bed. At lea&s;t, I thought the boys were his own. For tho' they are mu&s;cular, and big-boned, yet I &s;uppo&s;ed the healthy mother might have furni&s;hed them with legs and &s;houlders: For &s;he is not of a delicate frame; and then Tom, &s;ome years ago, looked up, and &s;poke more like a man, than he has done of late; &s;queaking inwardly, poor fellow! for &s;ome time pa&s;t, from contracted quail-pipes, and whee&s;ing from lungs half &s;pit away.</P>
<P>He complains, thou &s;aye&s;t, that we all run away from him. Why, after all, Belford, it is no plea&s;ant thing to &s;ee a poor fellow one loves, dying by inches, yet unable to do him good. There are friend&s;hips which are only <HI>bottle-deep:</HI> I &s;hould be loth to have it thought, that mine for any of my va&s;&s;als is &s;uch a one. Yet, to gay hearts, which <HI>became intimate becau&s;e they were gay,</HI> the rea&s;on for their fir&s;t intimacy cea&s;ing, the friend&s;hip will fade; that &s;ort of friend&s;hip, I mean, which may be di&s;tingui&s;hed, more properly, by the word <HI>companion&s;hip.</HI></P>
<P>But mine, as I &s;aid, is deeper than this: I would &s;till be as ready as ever I was in my life, to the utmo&s;t of my power, to do him &s;ervice.</P>
<P>As one in&s;tance of this my readine&s;s to extricate him from all his difficulties as to Thoma&s;ine, do&s;t thou care to propo&s;e to him an expedient, that is ju&s;t come into my head?</P>
<P>It is this: I would engage Thoma&s;ine, and her cubs, if Belton be convinced they are neither of them his, in a party of plea&s;ure: She was always complai&s;ant to me: It
<PB N="214" REF="215">
&s;hould be in a boat hired for the purpo&s;e, to &s;ail to Tilbury, to the i&s;le of Sheepy, or a plea&s;uring up the Medway; and 'tis but contriving to turn the boat bottom-upward: I can &s;wim like a fi&s;h: Another boat &s;hould be ready to take up whom I &s;hould direct, for fear of the wor&s;t: And then, if Tom has a mind to be decent, one &s;uit of mourning will &s;erve for all three: Nay, the ho&s;tler-cou&s;in may take his plunge from the &s;teerage: And who knows but they may be thrown up on the beach, Thoma&s;ine and he, hand in hand?</P>
<P>This, thou'lt &s;ay, is no <HI>common</HI> in&s;tance of friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Mean time, do thou prevail upon him to come down to us: He never was more welcome in his life, than he &s;hall be now: If he will not, let him find me &s;ome other &s;ervice; and I will clap a pair of wings to my &s;houlders, and he &s;hall &s;ee me come flying in at his windows at the word of command.</P>
<P>As for thy re&s;olution of repenting and marrying; I would have thee con&s;ider which thou wilt &s;et about fir&s;t. If thou wilt follow my advice, thou &s;halt make &s;hort work of it: Let Matrimony take place of the other; for the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> thou wilt, very po&s;&s;ibly, have Repentance come tumbling in fa&s;t upon thee, as a con&s;equence, and &s;o have both i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> one.</P>

<P>THIS morning I was admitted, as &s;oon as I &s;ent up my name, into the pre&s;ence of the divine lady. Such I may call her; as what I have to relate will fully prove.</P>
<P>She had had a tolerable night, and was much better in &s;pirits; though weak in per&s;on; and vi&s;ibly declining in looks.</P>
<P>Mrs. Lovick and Mrs. Smith were with her; and ac|cu&s;ed her, in a gentle manner, of having applied her&s;elf too a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly to her pen for her &s;trength, having been up ever &s;ince five. She &s;aid, &s;he had re&s;ted better th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;he had done for many nights: She had found her &s;pirit
<PB N="215" REF="216">
free, and her mind tolerably ea&s;y: And having, as &s;he had rea&s;on to think, but a &s;hort time, and much to do in it; &s;he mu&s;t be a good hou&s;ewife of her hours.</P>
<P>She had been writing, &s;he &s;aid, a letter to her &s;i&s;ter: But had not plea&s;ed her&s;elf in it; tho' &s;he had made two or three e&s;&s;ays: But that the la&s;t mu&s;t go.</P>
<P>By hints I had dropt, from time to time, &s;he had rea|&s;on, &s;he &s;aid, to think that I knew every-thing that concern|ed her and her family; and, if &s;o, mu&s;t be acquainted with the heavy cur&s;e her father had laid upon her; which had been dreadfully fulfilled in one part, as to her tem|porary pro&s;pects, and that in a very &s;hort time; which gave her great apprehen&s;ions for the other. She had been applying her&s;elf to her &s;i&s;ter, to obtain a revocation of it. I hope my father will revoke it, &s;aid &s;he, or I &s;hall be very mi&s;erable.&mdash; Yet (and &s;he ga&s;ped as &s;he &s;poke, with apprehen&s;ion)&mdash;I am ready to tremble at what the an&s;wer may be; for my &s;i&s;ter is hard-hearted.</P>
<P>I &s;aid &s;omething reflecting upon her friends; as to what they would de&s;erve to be thought of, if the unmerited im|precation were not withdrawn.&mdash;Upon which &s;he took me up, and talked in &s;uch a dutiful manner of her parents, as mu&s;t doubly condemn them (if they remain implacable), for their inhuman treatment of &s;uch a daughter.</P>
<P>She &s;aid, I mu&s;t not blame her parents: It was her dear Mi&s;s Howe's fault. But what an enormity was there in her crime, which could &s;et the be&s;t of parents (as they had been to her, till &s;he di&s;obliged them) in a bad light, for re&s;enting the ra&s;hne&s;s of a child, from who&s;e educa|tion they had rea&s;on to expect better fruits! There were &s;ome hard circum&s;tances in her ca&s;e, it was true: But my <HI>friend</HI> could tell me, that no <HI>one</HI> body, throughout the whole fatal tran&s;action, had acted out of character, but <HI>her&s;elf.</HI> She &s;ubmitted therefore to the penalty &s;he had incurred. If they had any fault, it was only, that they would not inform them&s;elves of &s;ome circum&s;tances, which would alleviate a little her mi&s;deed; and that, &s;uppo&s;ing her a guiltier creature than &s;he was, they puni&s;hed her without a hearing.</P>
<P>Lord!&mdash;<HI>I was going to cur&s;e thee, Lovelace! How every in&s;tance of excellence, in this all-excelling creature, condemns
<PB N="216" REF="217">
thee!&mdash;Thou wilt have rea&s;on to think thy&s;elf of all men mo&s;t accur&s;ed, if &s;he die!</HI></P>
<P>I then be&s;ought her, while &s;he was capable of &s;uch glo|rious in&s;tances of genero&s;ity and forgivene&s;s, to extend her goodne&s;s to a man, who&s;e heart bled in every vein of it, for the injuries he had done her; and who would make it the &s;tudy of his whole life to repair them.</P>
<P>The women would have withdrawn, when the &s;ubject became &s;o particular. But &s;he would not permit them to go. She told me, that if, after this time, I was for en|tering, with &s;o much earne&s;tne&s;s, into a &s;ubject &s;o very di&s;agreeable to <HI>her,</HI> my vi&s;its mu&s;t not be repeated. Nor was there occa&s;ion, &s;he &s;aid, for my friendly offices in your favour; &s;ince &s;he had begun to write her whole mind upon that &s;ubject to Mi&s;s Howe, in an&s;wer to letters from her, in which Mi&s;s Howe urged the &s;ame arguments, in compliment to the wi&s;hes of your noble and worthy relations.</P>
<P>Mean time, you may let him know, &s;aid &s;he, That I reject him with my whole heart:&mdash;Yet that, altho' I &s;ay this with &s;uch a determination as &s;hall leave no room for doubt, however I &s;ay it not with pa&s;&s;ion. On the con|trary, tell him, that I am trying to bring my mind into &s;uch a frame, as to be able to <HI>pity</HI> him (Poor perjured wretch! what has he not to an&s;wer for!); and that I &s;hall not think my&s;elf qualified for the &s;tate I am a&s;piring to, if, after a few &s;truggles more, I cannot <HI>forgive</HI> him too: And I hope, cla&s;ping her hands together, uplifted, as were her eyes, my dear <HI>earthly</HI> father will &s;et me the example my <HI>heavenly</HI> one has already &s;et us all; and, by forgiving his fallen daughter, teach her to forgive the man, who then, I hope, will not have de&s;troyed my eternal pro|&s;pects, as he has my temporal!</P>

<P>Here I &s;topt. She was &s;ilent. I proceeded &mdash; Have you no commi&s;&s;ion to employ me in; de&s;erted as you are by all your friends; among &s;trangers, though, I doubt not, worthy people? Cannot I be &s;erviceable by me&s;&s;age, by letter-writing, by attending per&s;onally, with either me&s;&s;age or letter, your father, your uncles, your brother, your &s;i&s;ter, Mi&s;s Howe, Lord M. or the ladies his &s;i&s;ters? Any office to be employed in to &s;erve you, ab&s;olutely <HI>independ|ent</HI> of my <HI>friend</HI>'s wi&s;hes, or of my own wi&s;hes to oblige him. Think, Madam, if I cannot?</P>
<P>I thank you, Sir: Very heartily I thank you: But in nothing that I can at pre&s;ent think of, or at lea&s;t re&s;olve upon, can you do me &s;ervice. I will &s;ee what return the letter I have written will bring me. &mdash; Till then &mdash;</P>
<P>My life and my fortune, interrupted I, are devoted to your &s;ervice. Permit me to ob&s;erve, that here you are, without one natural friend; and (&s;o much do I know of your unhappy ca&s;e) that you mu&s;t be in a manner de&s;ti|tute of the means to <HI>make</HI> friends&mdash;</P>
<P>She was going to interrupt me, with a prohibitory kind of earne&s;tne&s;s in her manner&mdash;</P>
<P>I beg leave to proceed, Madam: I have ca&s;t about twenty ways how to mention this before&punc; but never dared till now. Suffer me, now that I have broke the ice, to tender my&s;elf &mdash; as your <HI>banker</HI> only.&mdash; I know you will

<P>And down behind her chair I dropt a Bank note of 100 l. which I had brought with me, intending &s;ome how or other to leave it behind me: Nor &s;hould&s;t thou ever have known it, had &s;he favoured me with the acceptance of it; and &s;o I told her.</P>

I have no need of your kindne&s;s. I have effects enough, which I never can want, to &s;upply my pre&s;ent occa&s;ions; and, if needful, can have recour&s;e to Mi&s;s Howe.

<P>Not one, Sir, till you have taken back what you have let fall. I doubt not either the <HI>honour,</HI> or the <HI>kindne&s;s,</HI> of your offer; but you mu&s;t not &s;ay one word more on this &s;ubject. I cannot bear it.</P>
<P>She was &s;tooping, but with pain. I therefore prevented her; and be&s;ought her to forgive me for a tender, which, I &s;aw, had been more di&s;compo&s;ing to her than I had hoped (from the purity of my intentions), it would be. But I could not bear to think, that &s;uch a mind as hers &s;hould be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed: Since the want of the conveniencies &s;he was u&s;ed to abound in might affect and di&s;turb her in the divine cour&s;e &s;he was in.</P>
<P>You are very kind to me, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, and very fa|vourable in your opinion of me. But I hope, that I can|not now be ea&s;ily put out of my pre&s;ent cour&s;e. My de|clining health will more and more confirm me in it. Tho&s;e
<PB N="219" REF="220">
who arre&s;ted and con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ined me, no doubt, thought they had fallen upon the ready method to di&s;tre&s;s me &s;o, as to bring me into all their mea&s;ures. But I pre&s;ume to hope, that I have a mind that cannot be deba&s;ed, in <HI>e&s;&s;ential in&s;tances,</HI> by <HI>temporary calamities:</HI> Little do tho&s;e poor wretches know of the force of innate principles, forgive my own <HI>implied</HI> vanity, was her word, who imagine, that a pri&s;on, or penury, or want, can bring a right-turned mind to be guilty of a wilful ba&s;ene&s;s, in order to avoid &s;uch <HI>&s;hort-lived evils.</HI></P>
<P>She then turned from me towards the window, with a dignity &s;uitable to her words; and &s;uch as &s;hewed her to be more of &s;oul than of body, at that in&s;tant.</P>
<P>What magnanimity! &mdash; No wonder a virtue &s;o &s;olidly ba&s;ed could baffle all thy arts: &mdash; And that it forced thee (in order to carry thy accur&s;ed point) to have recour&s;e to tho&s;e un-natural ones, which robbed her of her charming &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>The women were extremely affected, Mrs. Lovick e&s;pe|cially;&mdash;who &s;aid whi&s;peringly to Mrs. Smith; We have an angel, not a woman, with us, Mrs. Smith!</P>
<P>I repeated my offers to write to any of her friends; and told her, that, having taken the liberty to acquaint Dr. H. with the cruel di&s;plea&s;ure of her relations, as what I pre|&s;umed lay neare&s;t her heart, he had propo&s;ed to write him|&s;elf, to acquaint her friends how ill &s;he was, if &s;he would not take it ami&s;s.</P>
<P>It was kind in the <HI>Doctor,</HI> &s;he &s;aid: But begged, that no &s;tep of that &s;ort might be taken without her knowlege and con&s;ent. She would wait to &s;ee what effects her let|ter to her &s;i&s;ter would have. All &s;he had to hope for, was, that her father would revoke his malediction: For the re&s;t, her friends would think &s;he could not &s;uffer too much; and &s;he was content to &s;uffer: For, now, nothing could happen, that could make her wi&s;h to live.</P>
<P>Mrs. Smith went down; and, &s;oon returning, a&s;ked, If the lady and I would not dine with her that day: For it yes her wedding-day. She had engaged Mrs. Lovick, &s;ee &s;aid; and &s;hould have no-body el&s;e, if we would do her that favour.</P>
<P>The charming creature &s;ighed, and &s;hook her head&mdash;
<PB N="220" REF="221">
<HI>Wedding-day,</HI> repeated &s;he! &mdash; I wi&s;h you, Mrs. Smith, many happy wedding-days!&mdash;But you will excu&s;e <HI>me.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Smith came up with the &s;ame reque&s;t. They both applied to me.</P>
<P>On condition the <HI>lady</HI> would, I &s;hould make no &s;cruple; and would &s;u&s;pend an engagement: Which I actually had.</P>
<P>She then de&s;ired they would all &s;it down. You have &s;everal times, Mrs. Lovick and Mrs. Smith, hinted your wi&s;hes, that I would give you &s;ome little hi&s;tory of my|&s;elf: Now, if you are at lei&s;ure, that this gentleman, who, I have rea&s;on to believe, knows it all, is pre&s;ent, and can tell you if I give it ju&s;tly, or not; I will oblige your curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>They all eagerly, the man Smith too, &s;at down; and &s;he began an account of her&s;elf, which I will endeavour to repeat, as nearly in her own words, as I po&s;&s;ibly can: For I know you will think it of importance to be ap|pri&s;ed of her manner of relating your barbarity to her, as well as what her &s;entiments are of it; and what room there is for the hopes your friends have in your favour, from her.</P>
<Q><P>At fir&s;t when I took the&s;e lodgings, &s;aid &s;he, I thought of &s;taying but a &s;hort time in them; and &s;o, Mrs. Smith, I told you: I therefore avoided giving any other ac|count of my&s;elf, than that I was a very unhappy young creature, &s;educed from good friends, and e&s;caped from very vile wretches.</P>
<P>This account I thought my&s;elf obliged to give, that you might the le&s;s wonder at &s;eeing a young body ru&s;h|ing thro' your &s;hop, into your back apartment, all trembling, and out of breath; an ordinary garb over my own; craving lodging and protection; only giving my bare word, that you &s;hould be hand&s;omely paid: All my effects contained in a pocket-handkerchief.</P>
<P>My &s;udden ab&s;ence, for three days and nights toge|ther, when arre&s;ted, mu&s;t &s;till further &s;urpri&s;e you: And altho' this gentleman, who, perhaps, knows more of the darker part of my &s;tory, than I do my&s;elf, has informed you (as you, Mrs. Lovick, tell me), that I am only an <HI>unhappy,</HI> not a <HI>guilty</HI> creature; yet I think it incumbent upon me not to &s;uffer hone&s;t minds to be in doubt about my character.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="222">You mu&s;t know, then, that I have been, in one in|&s;tance (I had like to have &s;aid <HI>but</HI> in one in&s;tance; but that was a capital one), an undutiful child, to the mo&s;t indulgent of parents: For what &s;ome people call cruelty in them, is owing but to the exce&s;s of their love, and to their di&s;appointment; having had rea&s;on to ex|pect better from me.</P>
<P>I was vi&s;ited (at fir&s;t, with my friends connivance) by a man of birth and fortune, but of wor&s;e principles, as it proved, than I believed any man could have. My brother, a very head&s;trong young man, was ab&s;ent at that time; and, when he returned (from an old grudge, and knowing the gentleman, it is plain, better than I knew him), intirely di&s;approved of his vi&s;its: And, having a great &s;way in our family, brought other gentlemen to addre&s;s me: And at la&s;t (&s;everal having been rejected) he introduced one extremely di&s;agreeable: In every <HI>indif|ferent</HI> body's eyes di&s;agreeable. I could not love him. They all joined to compel me to have him; a rencounter between the gentleman my friends were &s;et again&s;t, and my brother, having confirmed them all his enemies.</P>
<P>To be &s;hort: I was con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ined, and treated &s;o very hardly, that, in a ra&s;h &s;it, I appointed to go off with the man they hated. A wicked intention, you'll &s;ay: But I was greatly provoked. Neverthele&s;s, I repented; and re&s;olved not to go off with him; yet I did not mi&s;tru&s;t his honour to me neither; nor his love; becau&s;e no|body thought me unworthy of the latter, and my for|tune was not to be de&s;pi&s;ed. But fooli&s;hly (wickedly, as my friends &s;till think, and contrivingly, with a de&s;ign, as they imagine, to abandon them) giving him a private meeting, I was trick'd away; poorly enough trick'd away, I mu&s;t needs &s;ay; tho' others, who had been fir&s;t guilty of &s;o ra&s;h a &s;tep, as the meeting of him was, might have been &s;o deceived and &s;urpri&s;ed, as well as I.</P>
<P>After remaining &s;ome time at a farm-hou&s;e in the country, behaving to me all the time with honour, he brought me to hand&s;ome lodgings in town, till &s;till better provi&s;ion could be made for me. But they proved to be, as he indeed knew and de&s;igned, at a vile, a very vile creature's; tho' it was long before I found
<PB N="222" REF="223">
her out to be &s;o; for I knew nothing of the town, or its ways.</P>
<P>There is no repeating what followed: Such unpre|cedented vile arts!&mdash;for I gave him no opportunity to take me at any di&s;reputable advantage.&mdash;</P></Q>
<P>And here (half covering her &s;weet face, with her hand|kerchief put to her tearful eyes) &s;he &s;topt.</P>
<P>Ha&s;tily, as if &s;he would fly from the hateful remem|brance, &s;he re&s;umed: &mdash; <Q>I made my e&s;cape afterwards from the abominable hou&s;e in his ab&s;ence, and came to yours: And this gentleman has almo&s;t prevailed on me to think, that the ingrateful man did not connive at the vile arre&s;t: Which was made, no doubt, in order to get me once more to tho&s;e wicked lodgings: For no|thing do I owe them, except I were to pay them</Q>&mdash; (She &s;ighed, and again wiped her charming eyes&mdash;adding in a &s;ofter, lower voice)&mdash;<HI>"for being ruined!"</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>Indeed, Madam, &s;aid I, guilty, abominably guilty, as he is in all the re&s;t, he is innocent of this la&s;t wicked outrage.</P>
<Q><P>Well, and &s;o I wi&s;h him to be. That evil, heavy as it was, is one of the &s;lighte&s;t evils I have &s;uffered. But hence you'll ob&s;erve, Mrs. Lovick (for you &s;eemed this morning curious to know if I were not a wife), that I <HI>never was married.</HI>&mdash;You, Mr. Belford, no doubt, knew before, that I am no wife: And now I never will be one. Yet, I ble&s;s God, that I am not a guilty creature!</P>
<P>As to my parentage, I am of no mean family: I have in my own right, by the intended favour of my grandfather, a fortune not contemptible: Independent of my <HI>father,</HI> if I had plea&s;ed; but I never will plea&s;e.</P>
<P>My father is very rich. I went by another name when I came to you fir&s;t: But that was to avoid being di&s;covered to the perfidious man; who now engages, by this gentleman, not to mole&s;t me.</P>
<P>My real name you now know to be Harlowe: <HI>Clari&s;&s;a</HI> Harlowe. I am not yet twenty years of age.</P>
<P>I have an excellent mother, as well as father; a woman of family, and fine &s;en&s;e&mdash;Worthy of a better child!&mdash;They both doated upon me.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="224">
I have two good uncles: Men of great fortune; jealous of the honour of their family; which I have wounded.</P>
<P>I was the joy of their hearts; and, with theirs and my father's, I had three hou&s;es to call my own; for they u&s;ed to have me with them by turns, and almo&s;t kindly to quarrel for me: So that I was two months in the year at one's hou&s;e; two months at the other's: Six months at my father's; and two at the hou&s;es of others of my dear friends, who thought them&s;elves happy in me: And whenever I was at any one's, I was crouded upon with letters by all the re&s;t, who longed for my return to them.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I was beloved by every-body. The Poor &mdash; I u&s;ed to make glad <HI>their</HI> hearts: I never &s;hut my hand to any di&s;tre&s;s, where-ever I was &mdash; But now I am poor my&s;elf!</P>
<P>So, Mrs. Smith, &s;o, Mrs. Lovick, I am <HI>not</HI> married. It is but ju&s;t to tell you &s;o. And I am now, as I ought to be, in a &s;tate of humiliation and penitence for the ra&s;h &s;tep which has been followed by &s;o much evil. God, I hope, will forgive me, as I am endeavouring to bring my mind to forgive all the world, even the man who has ingratefully, and by dreadful perjuries (Poor wretch! he thought all his wickedne&s;s to be <HI>wit!</HI>) reduced to this, a young creature, who had <HI>his</HI> happine&s;s in her <HI>view,</HI> and in her <HI>wi&s;h,</HI> even beyond this life; and who was believed to be of rank, and fortune, and expectations, con&s;iderable enough to make it the <HI>intere&s;t</HI> of any gentleman in England to be faithful to his vows to her. But I cannot expect that my parents will for|give me: My refuge mu&s;t be death; the mo&s;t painful kind of which I would &s;uffer, rather than be the wife of one who could act by me, as the man has acted, upon who&s;e birth, education, and honour, I had &s;o much rea&s;on to found better expectations.</P></Q>
<P><Q>I &s;ee, continued &s;he, that I, who once was every|one's delight, am now the cau&s;e of grief to every-one&mdash; You, that are &s;trangers to me, are moved for me! 'Tis kind! &mdash; But 'tis time to &s;top. Your compa&s;&s;ionate hearts, Mrs. Smith, and Mrs. Lovick, are too much
<PB N="224" REF="225">
touched (For the women &s;obb'd again, and the man was al&s;o affected). It is barbarous in me, with my woes, thus to &s;adden your wedding-day.</Q>
Then turning to Mr. and Mrs. Smith&mdash;
<Q>May you &s;ee many happy ones, hone&s;t, good couple!&mdash;How agreeable is it to &s;ee you both join &s;o kindly to celebrate it, after many years are gone over you!&mdash;I once&mdash;But no more!&mdash;All my pro|&s;pects of felicity, as to this life, are at an end. My hopes, like opening buds or blo&s;&s;oms in an over-forward &s;pring, have been nipt by a &s;evere fro&s;t!&mdash;Blighted by an ea&s;tern wind! &mdash; But I can but <HI>once die;</HI> and if life be &s;pared me, but till I am di&s;charged from a heavy malediction, which my father in his wrath laid upon me, and which is fulfilled literally in every article re|lating to this world, it is all I have to wi&s;h for; and death will be welcomer to me, than re&s;t to the mo&s;t wearied traveller, that ever reached his journey's-end.</Q></P>
<P>And then &s;he &s;unk her head again&s;t the back of her chair, and, hiding her face with her handkerchief, en|deavoured to conceal her tears from us.</P>
<P>Not a &s;oul of us could &s;peak a word. Thy pre&s;ence, perhaps, thou harden'd wretch, might have made us a&s;hamed of a weakne&s;s, which, perhaps, thou wilt deride <HI>me</HI> in particular for, when thou reade&s;t this!&mdash;</P>
<P>She retired to her chamber &s;oon after, and was forced, it &s;eems, to lie down. We all went down together; and, for an hour and half, dwelt upon her prai&s;es; Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Lovick repeatedly expre&s;&s;ing their a&s;toni&s;hment, that there could be a man in the world capable of offend|ing, much more of wilfully injuring, &s;uch a lady; and repeating, that they had an angel in their hou&s;e. &mdash; I thought they had; and that as a&s;&s;uredly as there was a devil under the roof of good Lord M.</P>

<P>WHAT do&s;t hate me for, Belford? &mdash; And why more and more?&mdash;Have I been guilty of any of|fence thou knewe&s;t not before? &mdash; If <HI>pathos</HI> can move &s;uch a heart as thine, can it alter facts?&mdash;Did I not al|ways do this incomparable creature as much ju&s;tice as thou can&s;t do her for the heart of thee, or as &s;he can do her&s;elf?&mdash;What non&s;en&s;e then thy hatred, thy <HI>augmented</HI> hatred, when I &s;till per&s;i&s;t to marry her, pur&s;uant to word given to thee, and to faith plighted to all my relations? But hate, if thou wilt, &s;o thou do&s;t but write: Thou can&s;t not hate me &s;o much as I do my&s;elf: And yet I know, if thou really hated&s;t me, thou would&s;t not venture to tell me &s;o.</P>
<P>Well, but after all, what need of her hi&s;tory to the&s;e women? She will certainly repent, &s;ome time hence, that &s;he has thus needle&s;ly expo&s;ed us both.</P>
<P>Sickne&s;s palls every appetite, and makes us hate what we loved: But renewed health changes the &s;cene; di&s;|po&s;es us to be plea&s;ed with our&s;elves; and then we are in a way to be plea&s;ed with every-one el&s;e. Every hope, then, ri&s;es upon us: Every hour pre&s;ents it&s;elf to us on dancing feet: And what Mr. Addi&s;on &s;ays of Liberty, may, with &s;till greater propriety, be &s;aid of <HI>Health (For what is Liberty it&s;elf without Health?):</HI>

And I rejoice that &s;he is already &s;o much better, as to hold, with &s;trangers, &s;uch a long and intere&s;ting con|ver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Strange, confoundedly &s;trange, and as perver&s;e (that is to &s;ay, as <HI>womanly</HI>) as &s;trange, that &s;he &s;hould refu&s;e, and &s;ooner choo&s;e to die&mdash;[O the ob&s;cene word! and yet how free does thy pen make with it to me!], than be mine, who offended her by acting <HI>in</HI> character, while her pa|rents acted &s;hamefully <HI>out of theirs,</HI> and when I am now
<PB N="226" REF="227">
willing to act <HI>out of my own</HI> to oblige her: Yet I not to be forgiven! They to be faultle&s;s with her!&mdash;And mar|riage the only medium to repair all breaches, and to &s;alve her own honour!&mdash;Surely thou mu&s;t &s;ee the incon&s;i&s;tence of her <HI>forgiving</HI> unforgivingne&s;s, as I may call it!&mdash;Yet, heavy varlet as thou art, thou wante&s;t to be drawn up af|ter her! And what a figure do&s;t thou make with thy &s;peeches, &s;tiff as Hickman's ruffles, with thy a&s;pirations and pro&s;trations!&mdash;Unu&s;ed, thy weak head, to bear the &s;ublimities that fall, even in common conver&s;ation, from the lips of this ever-charming creature!</P>
<P>But the prettie&s;t whim of all, was to drop the bank note behind her chair, in&s;tead of pre&s;enting it on thy knees to her hand! &mdash; To make &s;uch a lady as this <HI>doubly</HI> &s;toop&mdash;By the acceptance, and to take it from the ground! &mdash;What an ungraceful <HI>benefit-conferrer</HI> art thou! How aukward, to take it into thy head, that the be&s;t way of making a pre&s;ent to a lady, was to throw the pre&s;ent be|hind her chair!</P>
<P>I am very de&s;irous to &s;ee what &s;he has written to her &s;i&s;ter; what &s;he is about to write to Mi&s;s Howe; and what return &s;he will have from the Harlowe-Arabella. Can&s;t thou not form &s;ome &s;cheme to come at the copies of the&s;e letters, or at the &s;ub&s;tance of them at lea&s;t, and of that of her other corre&s;pondencies? Mrs. Lovick, thou &s;eeme&s;t to &s;ay, is a pious woman: The lady, having gi|ven &s;uch a particular hi&s;tory of her&s;elf, will acquaint her with every-thing. And art thou not about to reform?&mdash; Won't this con&s;ent of minds between thee and the widow [What age is &s;he, Jack? The devil never trumpt up a friend&s;hip between a man and a woman, of any-thing like years, which did not end in matrimony, or the di&s;&s;ipa|tion of both their morals! won't it] &s;trike out an inti|macy between ye, that may enable thee to gratify me in this particular? A pro&s;elyte, I can tell thee, has great influence upon your good people: Such a one is a &s;aint of their own creation; and they will water, and cultivate, and cheri&s;h him, as a plant of their own rai&s;ing; and this from a pride truly &s;piritual!</P>
<P>But one con&s;olation ari&s;es to me, from the pretty re|grets this admirable creature &s;eems to have, in indulging
<PB N="227" REF="228">
reflections on the peoples wedding-day: &mdash;<HI>I</HI> ONCE!&mdash;thou make&s;t her break off with &s;aying.</P>
<P><HI>She once!</HI> What? &mdash; O Belford! why did&s;t thou not urge her to explain what &s;he <HI>once</HI> hoped?</P>
<P>What once a lady hopes, in love-matters, &s;he always hopes, while there is room for hope: And are we not both &s;ingle? Can &s;he be any man's but mine? Will I be any woman's but hers?</P>
<P>I never will! I never can!&mdash;And I tell thee, that I am every day, every hour, more and more in love with her: And, at this in&s;tant, have a more vehement pa&s;&s;ion for her than ever I had in my life!&mdash;And that with views ab|&s;olutely honourable, in <HI>her own &s;en&s;e</HI> of the word: Nor have I varied, &s;o much as in <HI>wi&s;h,</HI> for this week pa&s;t; firmly fixed, and wrought into my very nature, as the <HI>life of honour,</HI> or of generous confidence in me, was, in preference to the life of <HI>doubt</HI> and <HI>di&s;tru&s;t:</HI> That mu&s;t be a <HI>life of doubt</HI> and <HI>di&s;tru&s;t,</HI> &s;urely, where the woman con|fides nothing, and ties up a man for his good behaviour for life, taking church and &s;tate &s;anctions in aid of the obligation &s;he impo&s;es upon him.</P>
<P>I &s;hall go on Monday morning to a kind of Ball, to which Colonel Ambro&s;e has invited me. It is given on a family account. I care not on what: For all that de|lights me in the thing, is, that Mrs. and Mi&s;s Howe are to be there; Hickman, of cour&s;e; for the old lady will not &s;tir abroad without him. The Colonel is in hopes, that Mi&s;s Arabella Harlowe will be there likewi&s;e; for all the fellows and women of fa&s;hion round him are in|vited.</P>
<P>I fell in by accident with the Colonel, who, I believe, hardly thought I would accept of the invitation. But he knows me not, if he thinks I am a&s;hamed to appear at any place, where ladies dare &s;hew their faces. Yet he hinted to me, that my name <HI>was up,</HI> on Mi&s;s Harlowe's account. But, to allude to one of my uncle's phra&s;es, if it be, I will not <HI>lie abed</HI> when any-thing joyous is going forward.</P>
<P>As I &s;hall go in my Lord's chariot, I would have had one of my cou&s;ins Montague to go with me: But they both refu&s;ed: And I &s;ha'n't choo&s;e to take either of thy
<PB N="228" REF="229">
brethren. It would look as if I thought I wanted a body|guard: Be&s;ides, one of them is too rough, the other too &s;mooth, and too great a fop for &s;ome of the &s;taid company that will be there; and for <HI>me</HI> in particular. Men are known by their companions; and a fop (as Tourville, for example) takes great pains to hang out a &s;ign, by his dre&s;s, of what he has in his &s;hop. Thou, indeed, art an exception; dre&s;&s;ing like a coxcomb, yet a very clever fellow. Neverthele&s;s &s;o clum&s;y a beau, that thou &s;eeme&s;t to me, to owe thy&s;elf a double &s;pite, making thy un|gracefulne&s;s appear the <HI>more</HI> ungraceful, by thy remark|able tawdrine&s;s when thou art out of mourning.</P>
<P>I remember, when I fir&s;t &s;aw thee, my mind laboured with a &s;trong puzzle, whether I &s;hould put thee down for a great fool, or a &s;matterer in wit: Something I &s;aw was wrong in thee, by thy <HI>dre&s;s.</HI> If this fellow, thought I, delights not &s;o much in <HI>ridicule,</HI> that he will not &s;pare <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> he mu&s;t be plaguy &s;illy to take &s;o much pains to make his ugline&s;s more con&s;picuous than it would other|wi&s;e be.</P>
<P>Plain dre&s;s, for an ordinary man or woman, implies at lea&s;t <HI>mode&s;ty,</HI> and always procures kind quarter from the cen&s;orious.

<P>But, altho' I put on the&s;e lively airs, I am &s;ick at my &s;oul!&mdash;My whole heart is with my charmer! With what indifference &s;hall I look upon all the a&s;&s;embl&eacute;e at the Co|lonel's, my Beloved in my ideal eye, and engro&s;&s;ing my whole heart?</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am highly offended with my daughter's letters to Mi&s;s Harlowe. I knew nothing at all of her having taken &s;uch a liberty. The&s;e young creatures have &s;uch romantic notions, &s;ome of <HI>love,</HI> &s;ome of <HI>friend&s;hip,</HI> that there is no governing them in either. Nothing but time, and dear experience, will convince them of their ab&s;urdities in both. I have chidden Mi&s;s Howe very &s;everely. I had before &s;o ju&s;t a notion of what your whole family's di&s;tre&s;s mu&s;t be, that, as I told your brother, Mr. Antony Harlowe, I had often forbid her corre&s;ponding with the poor fallen angel&mdash;For &s;urely never did young lady more re&s;emble what we imagine of angels, both in per&s;on and mind. But, tired out with her head&s;trong ways (I am &s;orry to &s;ay this of my own child), I was forced to give way to it again: And, indeed, &s;o &s;turdy was &s;he in her will, that I was afraid it would end in a fit of &s;ickne&s;s, as too often it did in fits of &s;ullens.</P>
<P>None but parents know the trouble that children give:
<PB N="233" REF="234">
They are happie&s;t, I have often thought, who have none. And the&s;e women-grown girls, ble&s;s my heart! how un|governable!&mdash;</P>
<P>I believe, however, you will have no more &s;uch letters from my Nancy. I have been forced to u&s;e compul&s;ion with her, upon Mi&s;s Clary's illne&s;s (and it &s;eems &s;he is very bad); or &s;he would have run away to London, to attend upon her: And this &s;he calls doing the duty of a friend; forgetting, that &s;he &s;acrifices to her romantic friend&s;hip her duty to a fond indulgent mother.</P>
<P>There are a thou&s;and excellencies in the poor &s;ufferer, notwith&s;tanding her fault: And, if the hints &s;he has given to my daughter be true, &s;he has been mo&s;t grievou&s;ly ab|u&s;ed. But I think your forgivene&s;s and her father's for|givene&s;s of her ought to be all at your own choice; and no-body &s;hould intermeddle in that, for the &s;ake of due authority in parents: And be&s;ides, as Mi&s;s Harlowe writes it was what every-body expected, tho' Mi&s;s Clary would not believe it, till &s;he &s;marted for her credulity. And, for the&s;e rea&s;ons, I offer not to plead any-thing in alle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iation of her fault, which is aggravated by her ad|mirable &s;en&s;e, and a judgment above her years.</P>

<SALUTE>My deare&s;t Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE are bu&s;y in preparing for our little journey and voyage: But I will be ill, I will be very ill, if I cannot hear you are better before I go.</P>
<P>Rogers greatly afflicted me, by telling me the bad way you are in. But now you have been able to hold a pen,
<PB N="234" REF="235">
and as your &s;en&s;e is &s;trong and clear, I hope that the amu&s;ement you will receive from writing will make you better.</P>
<P>I di&s;patch this by an extraordinary way, that it may reach you time enough to move you to <HI>con&s;ider well</HI> before you ab&s;olutely decide upon the contents of mine of the 13th, on the &s;ubject of the two Mi&s;&s;es Montague's vi&s;it to me; &s;ince, according to what you write, mu&s;t I an&s;wer them.</P>
<P>In your la&s;t, you conclude very po&s;itively, that you will not be his. To be &s;ure, he rather de&s;erves an infa|mous death, than &s;uch a wife. But, as I really believe him innocent of the arre&s;t, and as all his family are &s;uch earne&s;t pleaders, and will be guarantees, for him, I think the compliance with <HI>their</HI> intreaties, and <HI>his own,</HI> will be now the be&s;t &s;tep you can take; your own family remain|ing implacable, as I <HI>can a&s;&s;ure you they do.</HI> He is a man of &s;en&s;e; and it is not impo&s;&s;ible but he may make you a good hu&s;band, and in time may become no bad man.</P>
<P>My mother is intirely of my opinion: And on Friday, pur&s;uant to a hint I gave you in my la&s;t, Mr. Hickma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> had a conference with the &s;trange wretch: And tho' he liked not, by any means, his behaviour to him&s;elf; no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, indeed, had rea&s;on to do &s;o; yet he is of opinion, that he is &s;incerely determined to marry you, if you will conde&s;cend to have him.</P>
<P>Perhaps Mr. Hickman may make you a private vi&s;it before we &s;et out. If I may not attend you my&s;elf, I &s;hall not be ea&s;y, except he does. And he will then give you an account of the admirable character the &s;urpri&s;ing wretch gave of you, and of the ju&s;tice he does to your virtue.</P>
<P>He was as acknowleging to his relations, tho' to his own condemnation, as his two cou&s;ins told me. All that he apprehends, as he &s;aid to Mr. Hickman, is, that if you go on appealing your ca&s;e, and expo&s;ing <HI>him,</HI> wed|lock it&s;elf will not wipe off the di&s;honour to both: And moreover,
<Q>that you would ruin your con&s;titution by your immoderate &s;orrow; and, by &s;eeking death when you might avoid it, would not be able to e&s;cape it when you would wi&s;h to do &s;o.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="236">So, my deare&s;t friend, I charge you, if you <HI>can,</HI> to get over your aver&s;ion to this vile man. You may yet live to &s;ee many happy days, and be once more the delight of all your friends, neighbours, and acquaintance, as well as a &s;tay, a comfort, and a ble&s;&s;ing, to your Anna Howe.</P>
<P>I long to have your an&s;wer to mine of the 13th. Pray keep the me&s;&s;enger till it be ready. If he return on Monday night, it will be time enough for his affairs, and to find me come back from Colonel Ambro&s;e's; who gives a Ball on the anniver&s;ary of Mrs. Ambro&s;e's birth and marriage, both in one. The gentry all round the neigh|bourhood are invited this time, on &s;ome good news they have received from Mrs. Ambro&s;e's brother the governor.</P>
<P>My mother promi&s;ed the Colonel for me and her&s;elf, in my ab&s;ence. I would fain have excu&s;ed my&s;elf to her; and the rather, as I had exceptions on account of the day <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">The 24th of July, Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe's anniver&s;ary birth-day.</NOTE>: But &s;he is almo&s;t as young as her daughter; and thinking it not &s;o well to go without me, &s;he told me, She could propo&s;e <HI>nothing</HI> that was agreeable to me.

<P>I am, moreover, willing to believe, not only from your own opinion, but from the a&s;&s;urances of one of Mr. Lovelace's friends, Mr. Belford, a good-natured and hu|mane man, who &s;pares not to cen&s;ure the author of my calamities (<HI>I think,</HI> with undi&s;&s;embled and unde&s;igning &s;in|cerity), that that man is innocent of the di&s;graceful arre&s;t:</P>
<P>And even, if you plea&s;e, in &s;incere compliment to your opinion, and to that of Mr. Hickman, that (over-per|&s;uaded by his friends, and a&s;hamed of his unmerited ba&s;e|ne&s;s to me) he, in earne&s;t, would marry <HI>me,</HI> if I would have <HI>him.</HI></P>
<Q><P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tho&s;e parts of this letter which are marked with inverted comma's (thus "), were tran&s;cribed afterwards by Mi&s;s Howe, in a letter to the ladies of Mr. Lovelace's family, dated July 29. and are thus di&s;tin|gui&s;hed to avoid the nece&s;&s;ity of repeating them, when that letter comes to be in&s;erted.</NOTE> Well, and now, what is the re&s;ult of all?&mdash;It is this:&mdash;That I mu&s;t abide by what I have already de|clared&mdash;And that is (Don't be angry at me, my be&s;t friend) That I have much more plea&s;ure in thinking of death, than of &s;uch a hu&s;band. In &s;hort, as I declared in my la&s;t, that I cannot&mdash;Forgive me, if I &s;ay, I <HI>will</HI> not&mdash;Ever be his.</P>
<P>But you will expect my rea&s;ons: I know you will:
<PB N="238" REF="239">
And if I give them not, will conclude me either ob&s;ti|nate, or implacable, or both: And tho&s;e would be &s;ad imputations, if ju&s;t, to be laid to the charge of a per|&s;on who thinks and talks of <HI>dying.</HI> And yet, to &s;ay, that re&s;entment and di&s;appointment have no part in my determination, would be &s;aying a thing hardly to be credited. For, I own, I <HI>have</HI> re&s;entments, &s;trong re|&s;entments, but not unrea&s;onable ones, as you will be convinced, if already you are not &s;o, when you know all my &s;tory&mdash;If ever you do know it&mdash; For I begin to fear (&s;o many things more nece&s;&s;ary to be thought of, than either this man, or my own vindication, have I to do) that I &s;hall not have time to compa&s;s what I have intended, and, in a manner, promi&s;ed you <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Letter <HI>xxv.</HI> p. <HI>85.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>I have one rea&s;on to give in &s;upport of my re&s;olu|tion, that, I believe, your&s;elf will allow of: But having owned, that I have re&s;entments, I will begin with tho&s;e con&s;iderations, in which anger and di&s;appointment have too great a &s;hare; in hopes, that having once di&s;bur|den'd my mind upon paper, and to my Anna Howe, of tho&s;e corroding unea&s;y pa&s;&s;ions, I &s;hall prevent them for ever from returning to my heart, and to have their place &s;upplied by better, milder, and more agreeable ones.</P>
<P>My pride, then, my deare&s;t friend, altho' a great deal mortified, is not <HI>&s;ufficiently</HI> mortified, if it be ne|ce&s;&s;ary for me to &s;ubmit to make that man my choice, who&s;e actions are, and ought to be, my abhorrence! &mdash;What!&mdash;&s;hall I, who have been treated with &s;uch premeditated and perfidious barbarity, as is painful to be thought of, and cannot with mode&s;ty be de&s;cribed, think of taking the violator to my heart? Can I vow duty to one &s;o wicked, and hazard my &s;alvation by joining my&s;elf to &s;o great a profligate, now I <HI>know</HI> him to be &s;o? Do you think your Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe &s;o lo&s;t, &s;o <HI>&s;unk,</HI> at lea&s;t, as that &s;he could, for the &s;ake of patching up, in the world's eye, a broken reputation, meanly appear indebted to the genero&s;ity, or <HI>compa&s;&s;ion</HI> perhaps, of a man, who has, by means &s;o inhuman, robbed her of it? Indeed, my dear, I &s;hould not think
<PB N="239" REF="240">
my penitence for the ra&s;h &s;tep I took, any thing better than a &s;pecious delu&s;ion, if I had not got above the lea&s;t wi&s;h to have Mr. Lovelace for my hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Yes, I warrant, I mu&s;t <HI>creep</HI> to the violator, and be thankful to him for doing me poor ju&s;tice!</P>
<P>Do you not already &s;ee me (pur&s;uing the advice you give), with a downca&s;t eye, appear before his friends, and before <HI>my own</HI> (&s;uppo&s;ing the latter would at la&s;t conde&s;cend to own me), dive&s;ted of that <HI>noble confidence,</HI> which ari&s;es from a mind uncon&s;cious of having de|&s;erved reproach?</P>
<P>Do you not &s;ee me creep about my own hou&s;e, pre|ferring all my hone&s;t maidens to my&s;elf &mdash;as if afraid, too, to open my lips, either by way of reproof or ad|monition, le&s;t their bolder eyes &s;hould bid me look in|ward, and not expect perfection from <HI>them?</HI></P>
<P>And &s;hall I intitle the wretch to upbraid me with his genero&s;ity, and his pity; and, perhaps to reproach me, for having been <HI>capable</HI> of forgiving crimes of <HI>&s;uch</HI> a nature?</P>
<P>I once indeed hoped, little thinking him &s;o <HI>premedi|tatedly</HI> vile a man, that I might have the happine&s;s to reclaim him: I vainly believed, that he loved me well enough to &s;uffer my advice for his good, and the ex|ample I humbly pre&s;umed I &s;hould be enabled to &s;et him, to have weight with him; and the rather, as he had no mean opinion of my morals and under&s;tanding: But now, what hope is there left for this my <HI>prime</HI> hope? <HI>Were</HI> I to marry him, what a figure &s;hould I make, preaching virtue and morality to a man whom I had tru&s;ted with opportunities to &s;educe me from all my own duties? &mdash; And then, &s;uppo&s;ing I were to have children by &s;uch a hu&s;band, mu&s;t it not, think you, cut a thoughtful per&s;on to the heart, to look round upon her little family, and think &s;he had given them a fa|ther de&s;tin'd, without a miracle, to perdition; and who&s;e immoralities, propagated among them by his vile example, might, too probably, bring down a cur&s;e upon them? And, after all, who knows but that my own &s;inful compliances with a man, who would think him&s;elf intitled to my obedience, might taint my own
<PB N="240" REF="241">
morals, and make me, in&s;tead of a reformer, an imi|tator of him?&mdash;For who <HI>can touch pitch, and not be defiled?</HI></P>
<P>Let me then repeat, that I truly de&s;pi&s;e this man! If I know my own heart, indeed I do!&mdash;I pity him!&mdash; <HI>Beneath</HI> my very pity, as he is, I neverthele&s;s pity him! &mdash;But this I could not do, if I &s;till loved him: For, my dear, one mu&s;t be greatly &s;en&s;ible of the ba&s;ene&s;s and ingratitude of tho&s;e we love. I love him not, there|fore! My &s;oul di&s;dains communion with him.</P>
<P>But altho' thus much is due to re&s;entment, yet have I not been &s;o far carried away by its angry effects, as to be rendered incapable of ca&s;ting about what I <HI>ought</HI> to do, and what <HI>could be done,</HI> if the Almighty, in order to lengthen the time of my penitence, were to bid me to live.</P>
<P>The &s;ingle life, at &s;uch times, has offer'd to me, as the life, the <HI>only</HI> life, to be cho&s;en. But in <HI>that,</HI> mu&s;t I not <HI>now</HI> &s;it brooding over my pa&s;t afflictions, and mourning my faults till the hour of my relea&s;e? And would not every-one be able to a&s;&s;ign the rea&s;on, why Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe cho&s;e &s;olitude, and to &s;eque&s;ter her&s;elf from the world? Would not the look of every creature, who beheld me, appear as a reproach to me? And would not my con&s;cious eye confe&s;s my fault, whether the eyes of others accu&s;ed me, or not? One of my delights was, to enter the cots of my poor neighbours, to leave le&s;&s;ons to the boys, and cautions to the elder girls: And how &s;hould I be able, uncon&s;cious, and without pain, to &s;ay to the latter, Fly the delu&s;ions of men, who had been &s;uppo&s;ed to have run away with one?</P>
<P>What then, my dear and only friend, can I wi&s;h for but death?&mdash;And what, after all, <HI>is</HI> death? 'Tis but a ce&s;&s;ation from mortal life: 'Tis but the fini&s;hing of an appointed cour&s;e: The refre&s;hing inn after a fatiguing journey: The end of a life of cares and troubles; and, if happy, the beginning of a life of immortal happine&s;s.</P>
<P>If I die not now, it may po&s;&s;ibly happen, that I may be taken when I am le&s;s prepared. Had I e&s;caped the evils I labour under, it might have been in the
<PB N="241" REF="242">
mid&s;t of &s;ome gay promi&s;ing hope; when my heart had beat high with the de&s;ire of life; and when the vanity of this earth had taken hold of me.</P>
<P>But now, my dear, for <HI>your</HI> &s;atisfaction let me &s;ay, that altho' I wi&s;h not for life, yet would I not, like a poor coward, de&s;ert my po&s;t, when I <HI>can</HI> maintain it, and when it is my <HI>duty</HI> to maintain it.</P>
<P>More than once, indeed, was I urged by thoughts &s;o &s;inful: But then it was in the height of my di&s;tre&s;s: And once, particularly, I have rea&s;on to believe, I &s;aved my&s;elf by my de&s;peration from the mo&s;t &s;hocking per|&s;onal in&s;ults: from a repetition, as far as I know&punc; of his vilene&s;s; the ba&s;e women (with &s;o much rea&s;on dreaded by me) pre&s;ent, to intimidate <HI>me,</HI> if not to a&s;&s;i&s;t <HI>him!</HI> &mdash; O my dear, you know not what I &s;uffered on that oc|ca&s;ion! &mdash; Nor do I what I <HI>e&s;caped</HI> at the time, if the wicked man had approached me to execute the horrid purpo&s;es of his vile heart. High re&s;olution, a cou|rage I never knew before; a &s;ettled, not a ra&s;h cou|rage; and &s;uch a command of my pa&s;&s;ions&mdash;I can only &s;ay, I know not how I came by &s;uch an uncommon elevation of mind, if it were not given me in an&s;wer to my earne&s;t prayers to Heaven for &s;uch a com|mand of my&s;elf, before I entered into the horrid com|pany.</P></Q>
<P>As I am of opinion, that it would have manife&s;ted more of revenge and de&s;pair, than of principle, had I committed a violence upon my&s;elf, when the villainy was <HI>perpetrated;</HI> &s;o I &s;hould think it equally criminal, were I now <HI>wilfully</HI> to neglect my&s;elf; were I <HI>purpo&s;ely</HI> to run into the arms of death (as that man &s;uppo&s;es I &s;hall do) when I might avoid it.</P>
<P>Nor, my dear, whatever are the &s;uppo&s;itions of &s;uch a &s;hort-&s;ighted, &s;uch a low-&s;ouled man, mu&s;t you im|pute to gloom, to melancholy, to de&s;pondency, nor yet to a &s;pirit of faulty pride, or &s;till <HI>more</HI> faulty revenge, the re&s;olution I have taken never to marry <HI>this;</HI> and if not <HI>this, any</HI> man. So far from de&s;erving this imputation, I do a&s;&s;ure you (my dear and <HI>only</HI> love) that I will do every-thing I can to prolong my life, till God, in mercy to me, &s;hall be plea&s;ed to call for it. I have rea&s;on to
<PB N="242" REF="243">
think my puni&s;hment is but the due con&s;equence of my fault, and I will not run away from it; but beg of Hea|ven to &s;anctify it to me. When appetite &s;erves, I will eat and drink what is &s;ufficient to &s;upport nature. A very little, you know, will do for that. And whatever my phy&s;icians &s;hall think fit to pre&s;cribe, I will take, though ever &s;o di&s;agreeable. In &s;hort, I will do every-thing I can do, to convince all my friends, who hereafter may think it worth their while to inquire after my la&s;t beha|viour, that I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed my &s;oul with tolerable patience; and endeavoured to bear with a lot of my own drawing: For thus, in humble imitation of the &s;ublime&s;t exemplar, I often &s;ay:&mdash;Lord, it is thy will; and it &s;hall be mine. Thou art ju&s;t in all thy dealings with the children of men; and I know thou wilt not afflict me beyond what I can bear: And, if I <HI>can</HI> bear it, I <HI>ought</HI> to bear it; and (thy grace a&s;&s;i&s;ting me) I <HI>will</HI> bear it.</P>
<P><Q>But here, my dear, is another rea&s;on; a rea&s;on that will convince you your&s;elf, that I ought not to think of wedlock; but of a quite different preparation: I am per&s;uaded, as much as that I am now alive, that I &s;hall not long live. The &s;trong &s;en&s;e I have ever had of my fault, the lo&s;s of my reputation, my di&s;appointments, the determined re&s;entment of my friends, <HI>aiding</HI> the barbarous u&s;age I have met with where I lea&s;t de&s;erved it, have &s;eized upon my heart: Seized upon it, before it was &s;o well fortified by <HI>religious con&s;iderations,</HI> as I hope it now is. Don't be concerned, my dear&mdash;But I am &s;ure, if I may &s;ay it with as little pre&s;umption as grief, in the words of Job, That God will &s;oon <HI>di&s;&s;olve my &s;ub&s;tance;</HI> and <HI>bring me to death, and to the hou&s;e ap|pointed for all living.</HI></Q></P>
<P>And now, my deare&s;t friend, you know all my mind. And you will be plea&s;ed to write to the ladies of Mr. Love|lace's family, That I think my&s;elf infinitely obliged to them, for their good opinion of me; and that it has given me greater plea&s;ure than I thought I had to come in this life, that, upon the little knowlege they have of me, and that not per&s;onal, I was thought worthy (after the ill u&s;age I have received) of an alliance with their honourable fa|mily: But that I can by no means think of their kin&s;man

<P>THE letter accompanying This, being upon a very pe|culiar &s;ubject, I would not embara&s;s it, as I may &s;ay, with any other. And yet having &s;ome further matters upon my mind, which will want your excu&s;e for directing them to you, I hope the following lines will <HI>have</HI> that excu&s;e.</P>
<P>My good Mrs. Norton, &s;o long ago as in a letter dated the 3d of this month, <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See p. <HI>38, 39.</HI> of this Volume.</NOTE> hinted to me, that my relations took ami&s;s &s;ome &s;evere things you was plea&s;ed, in love to me, to &s;ay of them. Mrs. Norton mentioned it with that re&s;pectful love which &s;he bears to my deare&s;t friend: But wi&s;hed, for <HI>my</HI> &s;ake, that you would rein<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in a vivacity, which, on mo&s;t other occa&s;ions, &s;o charmingly becomes you. This was her &s;en&s;e. You know that <HI>I</HI> am war|ranted to &s;peak and write freer to my Anna Howe, than Mrs. Norton would do.</P>
<P>I dur&s;t not mention it to you at that time, becau&s;e ap|pearances were <HI>&s;o</HI> &s;trong again&s;t me, on Mr. Lovelace's getting me again into his power, (after my e&s;cape to Ham&s;tead) as made you very angry with me when you an&s;wered mine on my &s;econd e&s;cape. And, &s;oon after|wards, I was put under that barbarous arre&s;t; &s;o that I could not well touch upon that &s;ubject till now.</P>
<P>Now, therefore, my deare&s;t Mi&s;s Howe, let me <HI>repeat</HI> my earne&s;t reque&s;t (for This is not the fir&s;t time by &s;eve|ral that I have been obliged to chide you on this occa&s;ion),
<PB N="244" REF="245">
That you will &s;pare my parents, and other relations, in all your conver&s;ations about me.&mdash;Indeed, I wi&s;h they had thought fit to take other mea&s;ures with me: But who &s;hall judge for them?&mdash;The event has ju&s;tified them, and con|demned me. They expected nothing good of this vile man; <HI>he</HI> has not, therefore, deceived <HI>them:</HI> But they expected other things from <HI>me;</HI> and <HI>I</HI> have. And they have the more rea&s;on to be &s;et again&s;t me, if (as my aunt Hervey wrote formerly <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. <HI>III.</HI> Letter <HI>L.</HI> p. <HI>248.</HI></NOTE>) they intended not to force my inclina|tions, in favour of Mr. Solmes; and if they believe, that my going off was the effect of choice and premeditation.</P>
<P>I have no de&s;ire to be received to favour by them: For why &s;hould I &s;it down to wi&s;h for what I have no rea&s;on to expect? &mdash; Be&s;ides, I could not look them in the face, if they <HI>would</HI> receive me. Indeed I could not. All I have to hope for, is, fir&s;t, that my father will ab&s;olve me from his heavy malediction: And next, for a la&s;t ble&s;&s;ing. The obtaining of the&s;e favours are needful to my peace of mind.</P>
<P>I have written to my &s;i&s;ter; but have only mentioned the ab&s;olution.</P>
<P>I am afraid, I &s;hall receive a very har&s;h an&s;wer from her: My fault, in the eyes of my family, is of &s;o enor|mous a nature, that my <HI>fir&s;t</HI> application will hardly be encouraged. Then they know not (nor perhaps will believe), that I am &s;o very ill as I am. So that, were I actually to die before they could have time to take the ne|ce&s;&s;ary informations, you mu&s;t not blame them too &s;evere|ly. You mu&s;t call it a Fatality. I know not what you mu&s;t call it: For, alas! I have made them as mi&s;erable as I am my&s;elf. And yet &s;ometimes I think, that, were they chearfully to pronounce me forgiven, I know not whe|ther my concern for having offended them would not be augmented: Since I imagine, that nothing can be more wounding to a &s;pirit not ungenerous, than a <HI>generous for|givene&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>I hope your mamma will permit our corre&s;pondence for <HI>one</HI> month more, altho' I do not take her advice as to having this man. Only for <HI>one</HI> month. I will not de&s;ire it longer. When cata&s;trophes are con&s;ummating, what
<PB N="245" REF="246">
changes (changes that make one's heart &s;hudder to think of) may <HI>one</HI> &s;hort month produce!&mdash;But if &s;he will not&mdash; why then, my dear, it becomes us both to acquie&s;ce.</P>
<P>You can't think what my apprehen&s;ions would have been, had I known Mr. Hickman was to have had a meet|ing (on &s;uch a que&s;tioning occa&s;ion as mu&s;t have been his errand from you) with that haughty and uncontroulable man.</P>
<P>You give me hope of a vi&s;it from him: Let him <HI>expect</HI> to &s;ee me greatly altered. I know he loves me: For he loves every-one whom you love. A painful interview, I doubt! But I &s;hall be glad to &s;ee a man, whom <HI>you</HI> will one day, and an <HI>early</HI> day, I hope, make happy; and who&s;e gentle manners, and unbounded love for you, will make <HI>you</HI> &s;o, if it be not your own fault.</P>
<P>I am, my deare&s;t, kinde&s;t friend, the &s;weet companion of my happy hours, the friend ever deare&s;t and neare&s;t to my fond heart,</P>

<P>EXcu&s;e, my deare&s;t young Lady, my long &s;ilence. I have been extremely ill. My poor boy has al&s;o been at death's door; and, when I hoped that he was better, he has relap&s;ed. Alas! my dear, he is very dangerou&s;ly ill. Let us both have your prayers!</P>
<P>Very angry letters have pa&s;&s;ed between your &s;i&s;ter and Mi&s;s Howe. Every-one of your family is incen&s;ed again&s;t that young lady. I wi&s;h you would remon&s;trate again&s;t her warmth; &s;ince it can do no good; for they will not believe, but that her interpo&s;ition has your con|nivance; nor that you are &s;o ill as Mi&s;s Howe a&s;&s;ures them you are.</P>
<P>Before &s;he wrote, they were going to &s;end up young Mr. Brand the clergyman, to make private inquiries of your health, and way of life&mdash;But now they are &s;o exa&s;|perated, that they have laid a&s;ide their intention.</P>
<P>We have flying reports here, and at Harlowe-Place, of
<PB N="246" REF="247">
&s;ome fre&s;h in&s;ults which you have undergone: And that you are about to put your&s;elf into Lady Betty Lawrance's protection. I believe they would now be glad (as I &s;hould be), that you would do &s;o; and this, perhaps, will make them &s;u&s;pend for the pre&s;ent any determination in your favour.</P>
<P>How unhappy am I, that the dangerous way my &s;on is in prevents my attendance on you! Let me beg of you to write me word how you are, both as to per&s;on and mind. A &s;ervant of Sir Robert Beachcroft, who rides po&s;t on his ma&s;ter's bu&s;ine&s;s to town, will pre&s;ent you with this; and, perhaps, will bring me the favour of a few lines in return. He will be obliged to &s;tay in town &s;everal hours, for an an&s;wer to his di&s;patches.</P>
<P>This is the anniver&s;ary, that u&s;ed to give joy to as many as had the plea&s;ure and honour of knowing you. May the Almighty ble&s;s you, and grant, that it may be the only unhappy one that may be ever known by you, my deare&s;t young Lady; and by</P>

<SALUTE><HI>My dear Mrs.</HI> NORTON,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAD I not fallen into fre&s;h troubles, which di&s;abled me for &s;everal days from holding a pen, I &s;hould not have forborn inquiring after your health, and that of your &s;on; for I &s;hould have been but too ready to impute your own &s;ilence to the cau&s;e, to which, to my very great concern, I find it was owing. I pray to Heaven, my dear good friend, to give you comfort in the way mo&s;t de&s;ire|able to your&s;elf.</P>
<P>I am exceedingly concerned at Mi&s;s Howe's writing about me to my friends. I do a&s;&s;ure you, that I was as ignorant of her intention &s;o to do, as of the contents of her letter. Nor has &s;he yet let me know (di&s;couraged, I &s;uppo&s;e, by her ill &s;ucce&s;s), that &s;he <HI>did</HI> write. Impo&s;&s;i|ble to &s;hare the delight which &s;uch charming &s;pirits give,

without the inconvenience that will attend their volatility. &mdash;So mixed are our be&s;t enjoyments!</P>
<P>It was but ye&s;terday that I wrote to chide the dear crea|ture for freedoms of that nature, which her un&s;ea&s;onable love for me had made her take, as you wrote me word in your former. I was afraid, that all &s;uch freedoms would be attributed to <HI>me.</HI> And I am &s;ure, that nothing but my own application to my friends, and a full conviction of my contrition, will procure me favour. Lea&s;t of all can I expect, that either your mediation or hers (both of who&s;e fond and partial love of me is &s;o well known) will avail me.</P>
<Q>She then gives a brief account of the arre&s;t: Of her dejection under it: Of her apprehen&s;ions of being carried to her former lodgings: Of Mr. Lovelace's avowed innocence, as to that in&s;ult: Of her relea&s;e, by Mr. Belford: Of Mr. Lovelace's promi&s;e not to mole&s;t her: Of her cloaths being &s;ent her: Of the earne&s;t de&s;ire of all his friends, and of him&s;elf, to marry her: Of Mi&s;s Howe's advice to comply with their reque&s;ts: And, of her declared re&s;olution rather to die, than be his, &s;ent to Mi&s;s Howe, to be given to his relations, but as ye&s;terday. After which, &s;he thus proceeds:</Q>
<P>Now, my dear Mrs. Norton, you will be &s;urpri&s;ed, perhaps, that I &s;hould have returned &s;uch an an&s;wer: But, when you have every-thing before you, you, who know me &s;o well, will not think me wrong. And, be&s;ides, I am upon a better preparation, than for an earthly hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Nor let it be imagined, my dear and ever-venerable friend, that my pre&s;ent turn of mind proceeds from gloomi|ne&s;s or melancholy; for altho' it was <HI>brought on</HI> by di&s;ap|pointment (the world &s;hewing me early, even at my fir&s;t <HI>ru&s;hing</HI> into it, its true and ugly face); yet, I hope, that it has obtained a better root, and will every day more and more, by its fruits, demon&s;trate to me, and to all my friends, that it has.</P>
<P>I have written to my &s;i&s;ter. La&s;t Friday I wrote. So the dye is thrown. I hope for a gentle an&s;wer. But, per|haps, they will not vouch&s;afe me <HI>any.</HI> It is my <HI>fir&s;t</HI> di|rect application, you know. I wi&s;h Mi&s;s Howe had left me to my own workings, in this tender point.</P>
<P>It will be a great &s;atisfaction to me, to hear of your perfect recovery; and that my fo&s;ter-brother is out of danger. But why &s;aid I, <HI>out of danger?</HI>&mdash;When can <HI>this</HI> be ju&s;tly &s;aid of creatures, who hold by &s;o uncertain a te|nure?
<PB N="248" REF="249">
This is one of tho&s;e forms of common &s;peech, that proves the <HI>frailty</HI> and the <HI>pre&s;umption</HI> of poor mortals, at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>Don't be unea&s;y you cannot an&s;wer your wi&s;hes to be with me. I am happier than I could have expected to be among mere &s;trangers. It was grievous at fir&s;t; but u&s;e reconciles every-thing to us. The people of the hou&s;e where I am, are courteous and hone&s;t. There is a widow who lodges in it (have I not &s;aid &s;o formerly?), a good woman; who is the better for having been a proficient in the &s;chool of affliction.</P>
<P>An excellent &s;chool! my dear Mrs. Norton, in which we are taught to know our&s;elves, to be able to compa&s;|onate and bear with one another, and to look up to a better hope.</P>
<P>I have as humane a phy&s;ician (who&s;e fees are his lea&s;t regard), and as worthy an apothecary, as ever patient was vi&s;ited by. My nur&s;e is diligent, obliging, &s;ilent, and &s;ober. So I am not unhappy <HI>without:</HI> And <HI>within</HI>&mdash; I hope, my dear Mrs. Norton, that I &s;hall be every day more and more happy <HI>within.</HI></P>
<P>No doubt, it would be one of the greate&s;t comforts I could know, to have you with me: You, who love me &s;o dearly: Who have been the watchful &s;u&s;tainer of my helple&s;s infancy: You, by who&s;e precepts I have been &s;o much benefited!&mdash; In your dear bo&s;om could I repo&s;e all my griefs: And by your piety, and experience in the ways of Heaven, &s;hould I be &s;trengthened in what I am &s;till to go through.</P>
<P>But, as it mu&s;t not be, I will acquie&s;ce; and &s;o, I hope, will you: For you &s;ee in what re&s;pects I am <HI>not</HI> unhappy; and in tho&s;e that I <HI>am,</HI> they lie not in your power to remedy.</P>
<P>Then, as I have told you, I have all my cloaths in my own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. So I am rich enough, as to this world&punc; and in common conveniencies.</P>
<P>So you &s;ee, my venerable and dear friend, that I am not always turning the dark &s;ide of my pro&s;pects, in order to move compa&s;&s;ion; a trick imputed to me, too often, by my hard-hearted &s;i&s;ter; when, if I know my own heart, it is above all trick or artifice. Yet I hope at la&s;t I &s;hall be &s;o happy, as to receive <HI>benefit</HI> rather than <HI>reproach</HI>
<PB N="249" REF="250">
from this talent, if it <HI>be</HI> my talent. At <HI>la&s;t,</HI> I &s;ay; for who&s;e heart have I <HI>hitherto</HI> moved? &mdash; Not one, I am &s;ure, that was not <HI>predetermined</HI> in my favour!</P>

<P>WHAT pains thou take&s;t to per&s;uade thy&s;elf, that the lady's ill health is owing to the vile arre&s;t, and to her friends implacablene&s;s! Both, primarily (if they were), to be laid at thy door. What poor excu&s;es will good heads make for the evils they are put upon by bad hearts! &mdash; But 'tis no wonder, that he who can &s;it down premeditatedly to do a bad action, will content him&s;elf with a bad excu&s;e: And yet, what fools mu&s;t he &s;uppo&s;e the re&s;t of the world to be, if he imagines them as ea&s;ily to be impo&s;ed upon, as he can impo&s;e upon him&s;elf?</P>
<P>In vain do&s;t thou impute to pride or wilfulne&s;s the ne|ce&s;&s;ity to which thou ha&s;t reduced this lady of parting with her cloaths: For can &s;he do otherwi&s;e, and be the noble-minded creature &s;he is?</P>
<P>Her implacable friends have refu&s;ed her the current ca&s;h &s;he left behind her; and wi&s;hed, as her &s;i&s;ter wrote to her, to &s;ee her reduced to want: Probably therefore they will not be &s;orry that &s;he is reduced to &s;uch &s;treights; and will take it for a ju&s;tification from Heaven of their wicked hard-heartedne&s;s. Thou can&s;t not &s;uppo&s;e &s;he would take &s;up|plies from thee: To take them from me would, in her opinion, be taking them from thee. Mi&s;s Howe's mother is an avaritious woman; and, perhaps, the daughter could do nothing of that &s;ort unknown to her; and, if &s;he <HI>could,</HI> is too noble a girl to deny it, if charged. And then Mi&s;s Harlowe is firmly of opinion, that &s;he &s;hall never want nor wear the things &s;he di&s;po&s;es of.</P>
<P>Having heard nothing from town that obliges me to go thither, I &s;hall gratify poor Belton with my company till
<PB N="251" REF="252">
to-morrow, or perhaps till Wedne&s;day: For the unhappy man is more and more loth to part with me. I &s;hall &s;oon &s;et out for Ep&s;om, to endeavour to &s;erve him there, and re|in&s;tate him in his own hou&s;e. Poor fellow! he is mo&s;t horribly low-&s;pirited; mopes about; and nothing diverts him. I pity him at my heart; but can do him no good.&mdash; What con&s;olation can I give him, either from his pa&s;t life, or from his future pro&s;pects?</P>
<P>Our friend&s;hips and intimacies, Lovelace, are only cal|culated for &s;trong life and health. When &s;ickne&s;s comes, we look round us, and upon one another, like frighted birds, at the &s;ight of a kite ready to &s;ou&s;e upon them. Then, with all our bravery, what mi&s;erable wretches are we!</P>
<P>Thou telle&s;t me, that thou &s;ee&s;t reformation is coming &s;wiftly upon me. I hope it is. I &s;ee &s;o much difference in the behaviour of this admirable woman in <HI>her</HI> illne&s;s, and that of poor Belton in <HI>his,</HI> that it is plain to me, the &s;in|ner is the real coward, and the &s;aint the true hero; and, &s;ooner or later, we &s;hall all find it to be &s;o, if we are not cut off &s;uddenly.</P>
<P>The lady &s;hut her&s;elf up at &s;ix o'clock ye&s;terday after|noon; and intends not to &s;ee company till &s;even or eight this; not even her nur&s;e; impo&s;ing upon her&s;elf a &s;evere fa&s;t. And why? It is her birth-day! &mdash; Blooming, yet declining in her blo&s;&s;om! &mdash; Every birth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">day till this, no doubt, happy! &mdash; What mu&s;t be her reflections! &mdash; What ought to be thine!</P>
<P>What &s;port do&s;t thou make with my a&s;pirations, and my pro&s;trations, as thou calle&s;t them; and with my drop|ping of the bank note behind her chair. I had too much awe of her at the time, and too much apprehended her di&s;plea&s;ure at the offer, to make it with the grace that would better have become my intention. But the action, if aukward, was mode&s;t. Indeed, the fitter &s;ubject for ridicule with thee; who can&s;t no more ta&s;te the beauty and delicacy of mode&s;t obligingne&s;s, than of mode&s;t love. For the &s;ame may be &s;aid of inviolable re&s;pect, that the poet &s;ays of unfeigned affection.</P>
<Q><L>I <HI>&s;peak,</HI> I know not what!&mdash;</L>
<L>Speak ever &s;o; and if I <HI>an&s;wer</HI> you</L>
<L>I know not what, it &s;hews the more of love.</L>
<L>Love is a child that talks in broken language&punc;</L>
<L>Yet then it &s;peaks mo&s;t plain&punc;</L></Q>
<P><PB N="252" REF="253">The like may be pleaded in behalf of that mode&s;t re|&s;pect, which made the humble offerer afraid to invade the awful eye, or the revered hand; but aukwardly to drop its incen&s;e be&s;ide the altar it &s;hould have been laid upon. But how &s;hould that &s;oul, which could treat delicacy it|&s;elf brutally, know any-thing of this?</P>
<P>But I am &s;till more amazed at thy courage, to think of throwing thy&s;elf in the way of Mi&s;s Howe, and Mi&s;s Ara|bella Harlowe! &mdash; Thou wilt not dare, &s;urely, to carry this thought into execution!</P>
<P>As to <HI>my</HI> dre&s;s, and <HI>thy</HI> dre&s;s, I have only to &s;ay, That the &s;um total of thy ob&s;ervation is this: That <HI>my</HI> out&s;ide is the <HI>wor&s;t</HI> of me; and <HI>thine</HI> the <HI>be&s;t</HI> of thee: And what gette&s;t thou by the compari&s;on? Do thou reform the one, and I'll try to mend the other. I challenge thee to begin.</P>
<P>Mrs. Lovick gave me, at my reque&s;t, the copy of a me|ditation &s;he &s;hewed me, which was extracted by the lady from the Scriptures, while under arre&s;t at Rowland's, as appears by the date. She is not to know, that &s;he has taken &s;uch a liberty.</P>
<P>You and I always admired the noble &s;implicity, and natural ea&s;e and dignity of &s;tyle, which are the di&s;tingui&s;h|ing characteri&s;tics of the&s;e books, whenever any pa&s;&s;ages from them, by way of quotation in the works of other authors, popt upon us. And once I remember you, even <HI>you,</HI> ob&s;erved, that tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages always appeared to you like a rich vein of golden ore, which runs thro' ba&s;er me|tals; embelli&s;hing the work they were brought to authen|ticate.</P>
<P>Try, Lovelace, if thou can&s;t reli&s;h a divine beauty. I think it mu&s;t &s;trike tran&s;ient (if not permanent) remor&s;e into thy heart. Thou boa&s;te&s;t of thy ingenuity; let this be the te&s;t of it; and whether thou can&s;t be &s;erious on a &s;ubject &s;o deep, the occa&s;ion of it re&s;ulting from thy&s;elf.</P>

</BODY>
</TEXT></Q>
<P>I have a little lei&s;ure, and am in a &s;cribbling vein: In|dulge me, Lovelace, a few reflections on the&s;e &s;acred books.</P>
<P>We are taught to read the Bible, when children, and as a rudiment only; and, as far as I know, this may be the rea&s;on, why we think our&s;elves above it, when at a ma|turer age. For, you know, that our parents, as well as we, wi&s;ely rate our proficiency by the books we are advanced to, and not by our under&s;tanding what we have pa&s;&s;ed through. But, in my uncle's illne&s;s, I had the curio|&s;ity, in &s;ome of my dull hours (lighting upon one in his clo&s;et), to dip into it: And then I found, where ever I turned, that there were <HI>admirable things in it.</HI> I have borrowed one, on receiving from Mrs. Lovick the above meditations; for I had a mind to compare them by the book, hardly believing they could be &s;o exceedingly ap|po&s;ite as I find they are. And one time or other, it is very likely, that I &s;hall make a re&s;olution to give it a thorough peru&s;al, by way of <HI>cour&s;e,</HI> as I may &s;ay.</P>
<P>This, mean time, I will venture to repeat, is certain, that the &s;tyle is that truly ea&s;y, &s;imple, and natural one, which we &s;hould admire in other authors exce&s;&s;ively. Then all the world join in an opinion of its antiquity, and au|thenticity
<PB N="254" REF="255">
too; and the learned are fond of &s;trengthening their different arguments by its &s;anctions. Indeed, I was &s;o much taken with it at my uncle's, that I was half a&s;hamed that it appeared &s;o <HI>new</HI> to me. And yet, I cannot but &s;ay, that I have &s;ome of the Old Te&s;tament hi&s;tory, as it is cal|led, in my head: But, perhaps, am more obliged for it to Jo&s;ephus, than to the Bible it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Odd enough, with all our pride of learning, that we choo&s;e to derive the little we know from the under-cur|rents, perhaps muddy ones too, when the clear, the pel|lucid fountain-head is much nearer at hand, and ea&s;ier to be come at &mdash; Slighted the more, po&s;&s;ibly, for that very rea&s;on!</P>
<P>But man is a pragmatical fooli&s;h creature; and the more we look into him, the more we mu&s;t de&s;pi&s;e him.&mdash;Lords of the creation!&mdash;Who can forbear indignant laughter! When we &s;ee not one of the individuals of that creation, except his perpetually excentric &s;elf, but acts within its own natural and original appointments: And all the time, proud and vain as the conceited wretch is of fancied and &s;elf-dependent excellence, he is obliged not only for the or|naments, but for the nece&s;&s;aries of life, (that is to &s;ay, for food as well as raiment) to all the other creatures; &s;trutting with their blood and &s;pirits in his veins, and with their plumage on his back: For what has he of his own, but a very mi&s;|chievous, monkey-like, bad nature? Yet thinks him&s;elf at liberty to kick, and cuff, and elbow out every worthier creature: And when he has none of the animal creation to hunt down and abu&s;e, will make u&s;e of his power, his &s;trength, or his wealth, to oppre&s;s the le&s;s powerful and weaker of his own &s;pecies!</P>
<P>When you and I meet next, let us enter more largely into this &s;ubject: And, I dare &s;ay, we &s;hall take it by turns, in imitation of the two &s;ages of antiquity, to laugh and to weep at the thoughts of what mi&s;erable, yet con|ceited beings men in general, but we libertines in particu|lar, are.</P>
<P>I fell upon a piece at Dorrell's this very evening, inti|tled, <HI>The &s;acred Cla&s;&s;ics,</HI> written by one Blackwall.</P>
<P>I took it home with me; and had not read a dozen pages, when I was convinced, that I ought to be a&s;hamed of my|&s;elf to think, how greatly I have admired le&s;s noble and
<PB N="255" REF="256">
le&s;s natural beauties in pagan authors; while I have known nothing of this all-excelling collection of beauties, the Bible! By my faith, Lovelace, I &s;hall for the future have a better opinion of the good &s;en&s;e and ta&s;te of half a &s;core par&s;ons, whom I have fallen in with in my time, and de&s;pi&s;ed for <HI>magnifying,</HI> as I thought they did, the language and the &s;entiments to be found in it, in preference to all the antient poets and philo&s;ophers. And this is now a convincing proof to me, and &s;hames as much an infidel's pre&s;umption a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his ignorance, that tho&s;e who know lea&s;t, are the great|e&s;t &s;coffers. A pretty pack of would-be-wits of us, who cen&s;ure without knowlege, laugh without rea&s;on, and are mo&s;t noi&s;y and loud again&s;t things we know lea&s;t of!</P>

<P>I Came not to town till this morning early; poor Belton clinging to me, as a man de&s;titute of all other hold.</P>
<P>I ha&s;tened to Smith's; and had but a very indifferent account of the lady's health. I &s;ent up my compliments; and &s;he de&s;ired to &s;ee me in the afternoon.</P>
<P>Mrs. Lovick told me, that, after I went away on Satur|day, &s;he actually parted with one of her be&s;t &s;uits of cloaths, to a gentlewoman who is her (Mrs. Lovick's) benefactre&s;s, and who bought them for a niece who is very &s;peedily to be married, and whom &s;he fits out and portions as her in|tended heire&s;s. The lady was &s;o jealous that the money might come from you or me, that &s;he would &s;ee the pur|cha&s;er: Who owned to Mrs. Lovick, that &s;he bought them for half their worth: But yet, tho' her con&s;cience permit|ted her to take them at &s;uch an under-rate, the widow &s;ays, her friend admired the lady, as one of the lovelie&s;t of her &s;ex: And having been let into a little of her &s;tory, could not help tears at taking away her purcha&s;e.</P>
<P>She may be a good &s;ort of woman: Mrs. Lovick &s;ays, &s;he <HI>is:</HI> But SELF is an odious devil, that reconciles to &s;ome people the mo&s;t cruel and di&s;hone&s;t actions. But, neverthele&s;s, it is my opinion, that tho&s;e who can &s;uf|fer them&s;elves to take advantage of the nece&s;&s;ities of their
<PB N="256" REF="257">
fellow-creatures, in order to buy any thing at a le&s;s rate than would allow them the legal intere&s;t of their purcha&s;e-money (&s;uppo&s;ing they purcha&s;e <HI>before they want</HI>), are no better than robbers for the difference. &mdash; To plunder a wreck, and to rob at a fire, are indeed higher degrees of wickedne&s;s: But do not the&s;e as well as the others heighten the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and heap more mi&s;ery on the mi&s;erable, whom it is the duty of every one to relieve?</P>
<P>About three o'clock I went again to Smith's. The lady was writing when I &s;ent up my name; but admitted of my vi&s;it. I &s;aw a vi&s;ible alteration in her countenance for the wor&s;e; and Mrs. Lovick re&s;pectfully accu&s;ing her of too great a&s;&s;iduity to her pen, early and late, and of her ab&s;tinence the day before, I took notice of the alteration; and told her, that her phy&s;ician had greater hopes of her, than &s;he had of her&s;elf; and I would take the liberty to &s;ay, that de&s;pair of recovery allowed not room for cure.</P>
<P>She &s;aid, She neither de&s;paired nor hoped. Then &s;tep|ping to the gla&s;s; with great compo&s;ure, My countenance, &s;ays &s;he, is indeed an hone&s;t picture of my heart. But the mind will run away with the body at any time.</P>
<P>Writing is all my diver&s;ion, continued &s;he; and I have &s;ubjects that cannot be di&s;pen&s;ed with. As to my hours, I have always been an early ri&s;er: But now Re&s;t is le&s;s in my power than ever: Sleep has a long time ago quarrelled with me, and will not be friends, altho' I have made the fir&s;t advances. What <HI>will</HI> be, <HI>mu&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>She then &s;tept to her clo&s;et, and brought to me a parcel &s;ealed up with three &s;eals: Be &s;o kind, &s;aid &s;he, as to give This to your friend. A very grateful pre&s;ent it ought to be to him: For, Sir, this packet contains all his letters to me. Such letters they are, as, compared with his actions, would reflect di&s;honour upon all his Sex, were they to fall into other hands.</P>
<P>As to my letters to him, they are not many. He may either keep or de&s;troy them, as he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>I thought I ought not to forego this opportunity to plead for you: I therefore, with the packet in my hand, urged all the arguments I could think of in your favour.</P>
<P>She heard me out with more attention than I could have promi&s;ed my&s;elf, con&s;idering her determin'd re&s;olution.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="258">I would not interrupt you, Mr. Belford, &s;aid &s;he, tho' I am far from being plea&s;ed with the &s;ubject of your di&s;cour&s;e. The motives for your pleas in his favour, are generous. I love to &s;ee in&s;tances of generous friend&s;hip in either Sex. But I have written my full mind on this, &s;ubject to Mi&s;s Howe, who will communicate it to the ladies of his fa|mily. No more, therefore, I pray you, upon a topic that may lead to di&s;agreeable recriminations.</P>
<P>Her apothecary came in. He advi&s;ed her to the air, and blamed her for &s;o great an application, as he was told &s;he made, to her pen; and he gave it as the Doctor's opi|nion, as well as his own, that &s;he would recover, if &s;he her&s;elf de&s;ired to recover, and would u&s;e the means.</P>
<P>The lady may indeed write too much for her health, perhaps: But I have ob&s;erved on &s;everal occa&s;ions, that when the phy&s;ical men are at a lo&s;s what to pre&s;cribe, they forbid their patients what they be&s;t like, and are mo&s;t di|verted with.</P>
<P>But, noble-minded as they &s;ee this lady is, they know not half her noblene&s;s of mind, nor how deeply &s;he is wounded; and depend too much upon her <HI>youth,</HI> which I doubt will not do in this ca&s;e, and upon <HI>time,</HI> which will not alleviate the woes of &s;uch a mind: For, having been bent upon doing good, and upon reclaiming a libertine whom &s;he loved, &s;he is di&s;appointed in all her darling views, and will never be able, I fear, to look up with &s;atisfaction enough in her&s;elf to make life de&s;irable to her. For this lady had <HI>other</HI> views in living, than the common ones of eating, &s;leeping, dre&s;&s;ing, vi&s;iting, and tho&s;e other fa|&s;hionable amu&s;ements, which fill up the time of mo&s;t of her Sex, e&s;pecially of tho&s;e of it, who think them&s;elves fitted to &s;hine in and adorn polite a&s;&s;emblies. Her grief, in &s;hort, &s;eems to me to be of &s;uch a nature, that <HI>time,</HI> which alleviates mo&s;t other per&s;ons afflictions, will, as the poet &s;ays, <HI>give increa&s;e to hers.</HI></P>
<P>Thou, Lovelace, mighte&s;t have &s;een all this &s;uperior ex|cellence, as thou wente&s;t along. In every word, in every &s;entiment, in every action, is it vi&s;ible. &mdash;But thy cur&s;ed inventions and intriguing &s;pirit ran away with thee. 'Tis fit that the &s;ubject of thy wicked boa&s;t, and of talents &s;o egre|giou&s;ly mi&s;applied, &s;hould be <HI>thy</HI> puni&s;hment and thy cur&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="259">Mr. Goddard took his leave; and I was going to do &s;o too, when the maid came up, and told her, a gentleman was below, who very earne&s;tly inquired after her health, and de&s;ired to &s;ee her: His name Hickman.</P>
<P>She was overjoyed; and bid the maid de&s;ire the gentle|man to walk up.</P>
<P>I would have withdrawn; but, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;he thought it was likely I &s;hould have met him upon the &s;tairs, and &s;o &s;he forbid it.</P>
<P>She &s;hot to the &s;tairs-head to receive him, and, taking his hand, a&s;ked half a dozen que&s;tions (without waiting for any an&s;wer) in relation to Mi&s;s Howe's health; ac|knowleging, in high terms, her goodne&s;s in &s;ending him to &s;ee her, before &s;he &s;et out upon her little journey.</P>
<P>He gave her a letter from that young lady; which &s;he put into her bo&s;om, &s;aying, She would read it by-and-by.</P>
<P>He was vi&s;ibly &s;hocked to &s;ee how ill &s;he looked.</P>
<P>You look at me with concern, Mr. Hickman, &s;aid &s;he-Oh!

And beloved by every-body!&mdash;But I will not pain you!</P>
<P>Indeed, Madam, &s;aid he, I am grieved for you at my &s;oul.</P>
<P>He turned away his face with vi&s;ible grief in it.</P>
<P>Her own eyes gli&s;ten'd: But &s;he turned to each of us, pre&s;enting one to the other: Him to me, as a gentleman <HI>truly</HI> de&s;erving to be <HI>called &s;o;</HI> Me to him, as <HI>your</HI> friend, indeed [How was I, at that in&s;tant, a&s;hamed of my&s;elf!]; but, neverthele&s;s, as a man of humanity; dete&s;ting my friend's ba&s;ene&s;s; and de&s;irous of doing her all manner of good offices.</P>
<P>Mr. Hickman received my civilities with a coldne&s;s, which, however, was rather to be expected on your ac|count, than that it de&s;erved exception on mine. And the lady invited us both to breakfa&s;t with her in the morning; he being obliged to return next day.</P>
<P>I left them together, and called upon Mr. Dorrell, my attorney, to con&s;ult him upon poor Belton's affairs; and then went home, and wrote thus far, preparative to what may occur in my breakfa&s;ting-vi&s;it in the morning.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXXIII. <HI>Mr.</HI> BELFORD, <HI>To</HI> ROBERT LOVELACE, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Thur&s;day, July</HI> 27.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Went this morning, according to the lady's invitation, to breakfa&s;t, and found Mr. Hickman with her.</P>
<P>A good deal of heavine&s;s and concern hung upon his countenance; but he received me with more re&s;pect than he did ye&s;terday; which, I pre&s;ume, was owing to the lady's favourable character of me.</P>
<P>He &s;poke very little; for I &s;uppo&s;e they had all their talk out ye&s;terday and before I came this morning.</P>
<P>By the hints that dropped, I perceived that Mi&s;s Howe's letter gave an account of your interview with her at Col. Ambro&s;e's&mdash;of your profe&s;&s;ions to Mi&s;s Howe; and Mi&s;s Howe's opinion, that marrying you was the only way now left to repair her wrongs.</P>
<P>Mr. Hickman, as I al&s;o gathered, had pre&s;s'd her, in Mi&s;s Howe's name, to let her find her, on her return from the I&s;le of Wight, at a neighbouring farm-hou&s;e, where neat apartments would be made ready to receive her. She a&s;ked, How long it would be before they returned? And he told her, It was propo&s;ed to be no more than a fort|night out and in. Upon which, &s;he &s;aid, She &s;hould then perhaps have time to con&s;ider of that kind propo&s;al.</P>
<P>He had tender'd her money from Mi&s;s Howe; but could not induce her to take any. No wonder I was re|fu&s;ed! She only &s;aid, That, if &s;he had occa&s;ion, &s;he would be obliged to no-body but Mi&s;s Howe.</P>
<P>Mr. Goddard, her apothecary, came in before break|fa&s;t was over. At her de&s;ire he &s;at down with us. Mr. Hickman a&s;ked him, If he could give him any con&s;olation in relation to Mi&s;s Harlowe's recovery, to carry down to a lady, who loved her as &s;he loved her own life?</P>
<P>The lady, &s;aid he, will do very well, if &s;he will re|&s;olve upon it her&s;elf. Indeed you <HI>will,</HI> Madam. The Doctor is intirely of this opinion; and has ordered no|thing for you, but weak jellies, and innocent cordials, le&s;t you &s;hould &s;tarve your&s;elf. And, let me tell you, Madam, that &s;o much watching, &s;o little nouri&s;hment, and &s;o much
<PB N="260" REF="261">
grief, as you &s;eem to indulge, is enough to impair the mo&s;t vigorous health, and to wear out the &s;tronge&s;t con&s;titution.</P>
<P>What, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, can I do? I have no appetite. Nothing you call nouri&s;hing will &s;tay on my &s;tomach. I do what I can: And have &s;uch kind directors in Dr. H. and you, that I &s;hould be inexcu&s;able if I did not.</P>
<P>I'll give you a regimen, Madam, replied he; which, I am &s;ure, the Doctor will approve of, and will make phy|&s;ic unnece&s;&s;ary in your ca&s;e. And that is,
<Q>Go to re&s;t at ten at night. Ri&s;e not till &s;even in the morning. Let your breakfa&s;t be water-gruel, or milk-pottage, or weak broths: Your dinner any-thing you like, &s;o you will <HI>but</HI> eat: A di&s;h of tea, with milk, in the afternoon; and &s;agoe for your &s;upper: And, my life for yours, this diet, and a month's country-air, will &s;et you up.</Q></P>
<P>We were much plea&s;ed with the worthy gentleman's di&s;intere&s;ted regimen: And &s;he &s;aid, referring to her nur&s;e (who vouched for her), Pray, Mr. Hickman, let Mi&s;s Howe know the good hands I am in: And as to the kind charge of the gentleman, a&s;&s;ure her, that all I pro|mi&s;ed to her, in the longe&s;t of my two la&s;t letters, on the &s;ubject of my health, I do and will, to the utmo&s;t of my power, ob&s;erve. I have engaged, Sir (to Mr. Goddard), I have engaged, Sir (to me), to Mi&s;s Howe, to avoid all wilful neglects. It would be an unpardonable fault, and very ill become the character I would be glad to de&s;erve, or the temper of mind I wi&s;h my friends hereafter to think me mi&s;tre&s;s of, if I did not.</P>
<P>Mr. Hickman and I went afterwards to a neighbour|ing coffee-hou&s;e; and he gave me &s;ome account of your behaviour at the Ball on Monday night, and of your treatment of him in the conference he had with you be|fore that; which he repre&s;ented in a more favourable light than you had done your&s;elf: And yet he gave his &s;entiments of you with great freedom, but with the politene&s;s of a gentleman.</P>
<P>He told me how very determined the lady was again&s;t marrying you; that &s;he had, early this morning, &s;et her|&s;elf to write a letter to Mi&s;s Howe, in an&s;wer to one he brought her, which he was to call for at twelve, it being
<PB N="261" REF="262">
almo&s;t fini&s;hed before he &s;aw her at breakfa&s;t; and that at three he propo&s;ed to &s;et out on his return.</P>
<P>He told me, that Mi&s;s Howe, and her mother, and him&s;elf, were to begin their little journey for the I&s;le of Wight on Monday next: But that he mu&s;t make the mo&s;t favourable repre&s;entation of Mi&s;s Harlowe's bad health, or they &s;hould have a very unea&s;y ab&s;ence. He expre&s;&s;ed the plea&s;ure he had in finding the lady in &s;uch good hands: Propo&s;ed to call on Dr. H. to take his opinion, whether it was likely &s;he would recover; and hoped he &s;hould find it favourable.</P>
<P>As he was re&s;olved to make the be&s;t of the matter, and as the lady had refu&s;ed to accept of money offered by Mr. Hickman, I &s;aid nothing of her parting with her cloaths. I thought it would &s;erve no other end to men|tion it, but to &s;hock Mi&s;s Howe: For it has &s;uch a &s;ound with it, that a lady of her rank and fortune &s;hould be &s;o reduced, that I cannot my&s;elf think of it with patience; nor know I but <HI>one</HI> man in the world who can.</P>
<P>This gentleman is a little finical and formal; but I think him an agreeable &s;en&s;ible man, and not at all de|&s;erving of the treatment, or the character, you give him.</P>
<P>But you are really a &s;trange mortal: Becau&s;e you have advantages in your per&s;on, in your air, and intellect, above all the men I know, and a face that would deceive the devil, you can't think any man el&s;e tolerable.</P>
<P>It is upon this mode&s;t principle that thou deride&s;t &s;ome of us, who, not having thy confidence in their out&s;ide appearance, &s;eek to hide their defects by the taylor's and peruke-maker's a&s;&s;i&s;tance [Mi&s;takenly enough, if it be really done &s;o ab&s;urdly as to expo&s;e them more]; and &s;ay&s;t, That we do but hang out a &s;ign, in our dre&s;s, of what we have in the &s;hop of our minds. This, no doubt, thou thinke&s;t, is &s;martly ob&s;erved: But pr'ythee, Love|lace, tell me, if thou can&s;t, What &s;ort of a &s;ign mu&s;t thou hang out, wert thou obliged to give us a clear idea, by it, of the furniture of <HI>thy</HI> mind?</P>
<P>Mr. Hickman tells me, He &s;hould have been happy with Mi&s;s Howe &s;ome weeks ago (for all the &s;ettlements have been &s;ome time engro&s;&s;ed); but that &s;he will not marry, &s;he declares, while her dear friend is &s;o unhappy.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="263">This is truly a charming in&s;tance of the force of <HI>female friend&s;hip;</HI> which you and I, and our brother rakes, have con&s;tantly ridiculed as a chimerical and impo&s;&s;ible thing, in ladies of equal age, rank, and perfections.</P>
<P>But really, Lovelace, I &s;ee more and more, that there are not in the world, with all our conceited pride, nar|rower-&s;oul'd wretches than we Rakes and Libertines are. And I'll tell thee how it comes about.</P>
<P>Our early love of roguery makes us generally run away from in&s;truction; and &s;o we become mere &s;matterers in the &s;ciences we are put to learn; and, becau&s;e we <HI>will</HI> know no more, think there is no more to be <HI>known.</HI></P>
<P>With an infinite deal of vanity, un-reined imaginations, and no judgments at all, we next commence <HI>half-wits;</HI> and then think we have the whole field of knowlege in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and de&s;pi&s;e every one who takes more pains, and is more &s;erious, than our&s;elves, as phlegmatic &s;tupid fellows, who have no ta&s;te for the mo&s;t poignant plea&s;ures of life.</P>
<P>This makes us in&s;ufferable to men of mode&s;ty and merit, and obliges us to herd with tho&s;e of our own ca&s;t; and by this means we have no <HI>opportunities</HI> of &s;eeing or conver&s;ing with any-body who could or would &s;hew us what we are; and &s;o we conclude, that we are the clevere&s;t fellows in the world, and the only men of &s;pirit in it; and, looking down with &s;upercilious eyes on all who give not them&s;elves the liberties we take, imagine the world made for us, and for us only.</P>
<P>Thus, as to u&s;eful knowlege, while others go to the bottom, we only &s;kim the &s;urface; are de&s;pi&s;ed by people of &s;olid &s;en&s;e, of true honour, and &s;uperior talents; and, &s;hutting our eyes, move round and round (like &s;o many blind mill hor&s;es) in one narrow circle, while we ima|gine we have all the world to range in.</P>
<P>I THREW my&s;elf in Mr. Hickman's way, on his return from the lady; and we took a &s;mall repa&s;t, at the Le|beck's Head in Chandos-&s;treet.</P>
<P>He was exce&s;&s;ively moved at taking leave of her; being afraid, as he &s;aid to me, tho' he would not tell her &s;o) that he &s;hould never &s;ee her again. She charged him
<PB N="263" REF="264">
to repre&s;ent every-thing to Mi&s;s Howe in the mo&s;t favour|able light that the truth would bear.</P>
<P>He told me of a tender pa&s;&s;age at parting; which was, that having &s;aluted her at her clo&s;et-door, he could not help once more taking the &s;ame liberty, in a more fervent man|ner, at the &s;tairs-head, whither &s;he accompanied him; and this in the thought, that it was the la&s;t time he &s;hould ever have that honour; and offering to apologize for his free|dom (for he had pre&s;s'd her to his heart with a vehemence, that he could neither account for or re&s;i&s;t)&mdash;Excu&s;e you, Mr. Hickman! that I will: You are my brother, and my friend: And to &s;hew you, that the good man, who is to be happy with my beloved Mi&s;s Howe, is very dear to me, you &s;hall carry to her this token of my love (offering her &s;weet face to his &s;alute, and pre&s;&s;ing his hand between hers); and perhaps her love of <HI>me</HI> will make it more agreeable to her, than her punctilio would otherwi&s;e allow it to be: And tell her, &s;aid &s;he, dropping on one knee, with cla&s;ped hands, and uplifted eyes, that in this po&s;ture you &s;ee me, in the la&s;t moment of our parting, begging a ble&s;&s;ing upon you both, and that you may be the delight and comfort of each other, for many, very many, happy years!</P>
<P>Tears, &s;aid he, fell from my eyes: I even &s;obb'd with mingled joy and &s;orrow; and &s;he retreating as &s;oon as I rai&s;ed her, I went down &s;tairs, highly di&s;&s;atisfied with my|&s;elf for going; yet unable to &s;tay, my eyes fixed the con|trary way to my feet, as long as I could behold the &s;kirts of her raiment.</P>
<P>I went into the back-&s;hop, continued the worthy man, and recommended the angelic lady to the be&s;t care of Mrs. Smith; and, when I was in the &s;treet, ca&s;t my eye up at her window: There, for the la&s;t time, I doubt, &s;aid he, that I &s;hall ever behold her, I &s;aw her; and &s;he waved her charming hand to me, and with &s;uch a look of &s;miling goodne&s;s, and mingled concern, as I cannot de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>Pr'ythee tell me, thou vile Lovelace, if thou ha&s;t not a notion, even from the&s;e jejune de&s;criptions of mine (as I have from reflecting upon the occa&s;ion), that there mu&s;t be a more exalted plea&s;ure in intellectual friend&s;hip, than ever thou could&s;t ta&s;te in the gro&s;&s;er fumes of &s;en&s;&s;uality? And whether it may not be po&s;&s;ible for thee, in time, to
<PB N="264" REF="265">
give that preference to the <HI>infinitely</HI> preferable, which I hope, now, that I &s;hall always give?</P>

<P>YOUR two affecting letters were brought to me (as I had directed any letter from you &s;hould be), to the Colonel's, about an hour before we broke up. I could not forbear dipping into them there; and &s;hedding more tears over them than I will tell you of; altho' I dried my eyes, as well as I could, that the company I was obliged to return to, and my mamma, &s;hould &s;ee as little of my concern as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>I am yet (and was then &s;till more) exce&s;&s;ively flutter'd. The occa&s;ion I will communicate to you by-and-by: For nothing but the flutters given by the &s;troke of death could divert my <HI>fir&s;t</HI> attention from the &s;ad and &s;olemn contents of your la&s;t favour. The&s;e therefore I mu&s;t begin with.</P>
<P>How can I bear the thoughts of lo&s;ing &s;o dear a friend! I will not &s;o much as &s;uppo&s;e it. Indeed I <HI>cannot!</HI> Such a mind as yours was not ve&s;ted in humanity, to be &s;natch'd away from us &s;o &s;oon. There mu&s;t be &s;till a great deal for you to do, for the good of all who have the happine&s;s to know you.</P>
<P>You enumerate, in your letter of Thur&s;day la&s;t <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Letter</HI> L. <HI>p.</HI> 194.</NOTE>, the particulars in which your &s;ituation is already mended: Let me &s;ee, by effects, that you are in earne&s;t in that enu|meration; and that you really have the courage to re&s;olve to get above the &s;en&s;e of injuries you could not avoid; and then will I tru&s;t to Providence, and my humble prayers, for your perfect recovery: And glad at my heart &s;hall I be, on my return from the little I&s;land, to find you well enough to be near us, according to the propo&s;al Mr. Hickman has to make you.</P>
<P>You chide me, in yours of Sunday, on the freedom I take with your friends <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">See p. <HI>242.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="266">I <HI>may</HI> be warm. I know I <HI>am.</HI> &mdash; Too warm. &mdash;Yet warmth in friend&s;hip, &s;urely, cannot be a crime; e&s;peci|ally when our friend has great merit, labours under op|pre&s;&s;ion, and is &s;truggling with unde&s;erved calamity.</P>
<P>I have no notion of coldne&s;s in friend&s;hip, be it dignified or di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>prudence,</HI> or what it will.</P>
<P><HI>You</HI> may excu&s;e your relations. It was ever your way to do &s;o. But, my dear, other people mu&s;t be allowed to judge as they plea&s;e. I am not their daughter, nor the &s;i&s;ter of your brother and &s;i&s;ter&mdash;I thank Heaven, I am not.</P>
<P>But if you are di&s;plea&s;ed with me, for the freedoms I took &s;o long ago, as you mention, I am afraid, if you knew what pa&s;&s;ed upon an application I made to your &s;i&s;ter, very lately, to procure you the ab&s;olution your heart is &s;o much &s;et upon, that you would be &s;till <HI>more</HI> concerned.

<P>Once more, forgive me. I owned I was too warm&punc; But I have no example to the contrary, but from You: And the treatment you meet with, is very little encourage|ment to me, to endeavour to imitate you in your dutiful meekne&s;s.</P>
<P>You leave it to me, to give a negative to the hopes of the noble family, who&s;e only di&s;grace is, that &s;o very vile a man is &s;o nearly related to them. But yet&mdash;Alas! my dear, I am &s;o fearful of con&s;equences, (of <HI>&s;elfi&s;hly</HI> fearful, if this negative <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be given&mdash;I don't know what I &s;hould &s;ay&mdash; But give me leave to &s;u&s;pend, however, this negative, till I hear from you again.</P>
<P>Their earne&s;t court&s;hip of you into their &s;plendid fa|mily is &s;o <HI>very</HI> honourable to you&mdash;They <HI>&s;o ju&s;tly</HI> admire you&mdash;You mu&s;t have had &s;uch a <HI>noble triumph</HI> over the ba&s;e man &mdash; He is &s;o <HI>much</HI> in earne&s;t&mdash;The world knows &s;o <HI>much</HI> of the unhappy affair&mdash;You may do <HI>&s;till</HI> &s;o <HI>much</HI> good&mdash;Your will is <HI>&s;o</HI> inviolate &mdash; Your relations are <HI>&s;o</HI> implacable&mdash;Think, my dear, and <HI>re</HI>-think.</P>
<P>And let me leave you to do &s;o, while I give you the oc|ca&s;ion of the flutter I mentioned at the beginning of this letter; in the conclu&s;ion of which, you will find the ob|ligation
<PB N="266" REF="267">
I have con&s;ented to lay my&s;elf under, to refer this important point once more to your di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, before I give, in your name, the negative that cannot, when given, be with honour to your&s;elf repented of or recalled.</P>
<P>KNOW then, my dear, that I accompanied my mother to Colonel Ambro&s;e's, on the occa&s;ion I mentioned to you in my former. Many ladies and gentlemen were there, whom you know; particularly Mi&s;s Kitty D'Oily, Mi&s;s Lloyd, Mi&s;s Biddy D'Ollyffe, Mi&s;s Biddulph, and their re&s;pective admirers, with the Colonel's two nieces, fine women both; be&s;ides many whom you know not; for they were &s;trangers to me, but by name. A &s;plendid company, and all plea&s;ed with one another, till Colonel Ambro&s;e introduced one, who, the moment he was brought into the great hall, &s;et the whole a&s;&s;embl&eacute;e into a kind of agitation.</P>
<P>It was your villain.</P>
<P>I thought I &s;hould have &s;unk, as &s;oon as I &s;et my eyes upon him. My mother was al&s;o affected; and, coming to me, Nancy, whi&s;per'd &s;he, can you bear the &s;ight of that wretch without too much emotion? &mdash; If not, with|draw into the next apartment.</P>
<P>I could not remove. Every-body's eyes were glanced from him to me. I &s;at down, and fann'd my&s;elf, and was forced to order a gla&s;s of water. O that I had the eye the ba&s;ili&s;k is reported to have, thought I, and that his life were within the power of it&mdash;directly would I kill him!</P>
<P>He entered with an air &s;o hateful to me, but &s;o agree|able to every other eye, that I could have look'd him dead for that too.</P>
<P>After the general &s;alutations, he &s;ingled out Mr. Hick|man, and told him, He had recollected &s;ome parts of his behaviour to him when he &s;aw him la&s;t, which had made him think him&s;elf under obligation to his patience and politene&s;s.</P>
<P>And &s;o, indeed, he was.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s D'Oily, upon his complimenting her, among a knot of ladies, a&s;ked him, in their hearing, How Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe did?</P>
<P>He heard, he &s;aid, you were not &s;o well as he wi&s;hed you to be, and as you de&s;erved to be.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="268">O Mr. Lovelace, &s;aid &s;he, what have you to an&s;wer for, on that young lady's account, if all be true that I have heard?</P>
<P>I have a great deal to an&s;wer for, &s;aid the unblu&s;hing villain: But that dear lady has &s;o many excellencies, and &s;o much delica<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, that little &s;ins are great ones in her eye.</P>
<P><HI>Little &s;ins!</HI> reply'd the lady: Mr. Lovelace's character is &s;o well known, that no-body believes he can commit <HI>little</HI> &s;ins.</P>
<P>You are very good to me, Mi&s;s D'Oily.</P>
<P>Indeed I am not.</P>
<P>Then I am the only per&s;on to whom you are <HI>not</HI> very good: And &s;o I am the le&s;s obliged to you.</P>
<P>He turned, with an unconcerned air, to Mi&s;s Playford, and made her &s;ome genteel compliments. I believe you know her not. She vi&s;its his cou&s;ins Montague. Indeed, he had &s;omething in his &s;pecious manner to &s;ay to every-body: And this too &s;oon quieted the di&s;gu&s;t each per&s;on had at his entrance.</P>
<P>I &s;till kept my &s;eat, and he either &s;aw me not, or would not yet &s;ee me; and addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to my mother, taking her unwilling hand, with an air of high a&s;&s;urance, I am glad to &s;ee you here, Madam: I hope Mi&s;s Howe is well. I have rea&s;on to complain greatly of her: But hope to owe to her the highe&s;t obligations that can be laid on man.</P>
<P>My daughter, Sir, is accu&s;tomed to be too warm and too zealous in her friend&s;hips for either my tranquillity, or her own.</P>
<P>There had indeed been &s;ome late occa&s;ion given for mu|tual di&s;plea&s;ure between my mother and me: But I think &s;he might have &s;pared this to <HI>him;</HI> tho' no-body heard it, I believe, but the per&s;on to whom it was &s;poken and the lady who told it to me; for my mother &s;poke it low.</P>
<P>We are not wholly, Madam, to live for our&s;elves, &s;aid the vile hypocrite. It is not every-one who has a &s;oul capable of friend&s;hip: And what a heart mu&s;t that be, which can be in&s;en&s;ible to the intere&s;ts of a &s;uffering friend?</P>
<P>This &s;entiment from Mr. Lovelace's mouth, &s;aid my mother! &mdash; Forgive me, Sir; But you can have no end, &s;urely, in endeavouring to make <HI>me</HI> think as well of you,
<PB N="268" REF="269">
as &s;ome innocent creatures have thought of you, to their co&s;t.</P>
<P>She would have flung from him. But, detaining her hand&mdash;Le&s;s &s;evere, dear Madam, &s;aid he, be le&s;s &s;evere, in <HI>this</HI> place, I be&s;eech you. You will allow, that a very faulty per&s;on may &s;ee his errors; and when he does, and owns them, and repents, &s;hould he not be treated merci|fully?</P>
<P>Your air, Sir, &s;eems not to be that of a penitent. But the place may as properly excu&s;e this &s;ubject, as what you call my &s;everity.</P>
<P>But, deare&s;t Madam, permit me to &s;ay, that I hope for your intere&s;t with your <HI>charming</HI> daughter (was his &s;yco|phant world) to have it put into my power to convince all the world, that there never was a truer penitent. And why, why this anger, dear Madam (for &s;he &s;truggled to get her hand out of his); the&s;e violent airs, &s;o <HI>maidenly!</HI>&mdash;Im|pudent fellow!&mdash;May I not a&s;k, if Mi&s;s Howe be here?</P>
<P>She would not have been here, replied my mother, had &s;he known whom &s;he had been to &s;ee.</P>
<P>And is &s;he here, then?&mdash;Thank Heaven!&mdash; He di&s;en|gaged her hand, and &s;tept forward into company.</P>
<P>Dear Mi&s;s Lloyd, &s;aid he, with an air, (taking her hand, as he quitted my mother's) tell me, tell me, is Mi&s;s Arabella Harlowe here? Or will &s;he be here? I was informed &s;he would: And this, and the opportunity of paying my compliments to your friend Mi&s;s Howe, were great inducements with me to attend the Colonel.</P>
<P>Superlative a&s;&s;urance! Was it not, my dear?</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Arabella Harlowe, excu&s;e me, Sir, &s;aid Mi&s;s Lloyd, would be very little inclined to meet you here, or any-where el&s;e.</P>
<P>Perhaps &s;o, my dear Mi&s;s Lloyd: But, perhaps, for that very rea&s;on, I am more de&s;irous to &s;ee <HI>her.</HI></P>
<P>Mi&s;s Harlowe, Sir, &s;aid Mi&s;s Biddulph, with a threat|ening air, will hardly be here without her <HI>brother.</HI> I ima|gine, if one come, both will come.</P>
<P>Heaven grant they both may! &s;aid the wretch. No|thing, Mi&s;s Biddulph, &s;hall <HI>begin</HI> from me to di&s;turb this a&s;&s;embl&eacute;e, I a&s;&s;ure you, if they do. One calm half-hour's conver&s;ation with that brother and &s;i&s;ter, would be a mo&s;t
<PB N="269" REF="270">
fortunate opportunity to me, in pre&s;ence of the Colonel and his Lady, or whom el&s;e they &s;hould choo&s;e.</P>
<P>Then turning round, as if de&s;irous to find out the one or the other, or both, he '&s;pied me, and, with a very low bow, approached me.</P>
<P>I was all in a flutter, you may &s;uppo&s;e. He would have taken my hand. I refu&s;ed it, all glowing with indigna|tion: Every-body's eyes upon us.</P>
<P>I went from him to the other end of the room, and &s;at down, as I thought out of his hated &s;ight: But pre&s;ently I heard his odious voice, whi&s;pering, behind my chair (he leaning upon the back of it, with impudent unconcern) <HI>Charming Mi&s;s Howe!</HI> looking over my &s;houlder: <HI>One reque&s;t</HI>&mdash;I &s;tarted up from my &s;eat, but could hardly &s;tand neither, for very indignation&mdash;O this &s;weet, but becoming, di&s;dain, whi&s;per'd on the in&s;ufferable creature! &mdash; I am &s;orry to give you all this emotion: But either here, or at your own hou&s;e, let me intreat from you one quarter of an hour's audience. &mdash; I be&s;eech you, Madam, but one quarter of an hour, in any of the adjoining apartments.</P>
<P>Not for a kingdom, fluttering my fan. &mdash; I knew not what I did. &mdash;But I could have killed him.</P>
<P>We are &s;o much ob&s;erved&mdash;El&s;e on my knees, my dear Mi&s;s Howe, would I beg your intere&s;t with your charm|ing friend.</P>
<P>She'll have nothing to &s;ay to you.</P>
<P>I had not then your letters, my dear.</P>
<P>Killing words!&mdash;But indeed I have de&s;erved them, and a dagger in my heart be&s;ides. &mdash;I am &s;o con&s;cious of my demerits, that I have no hope, but in <HI>your</HI> interpo&s;ition&mdash; Could I owe that favour to Mi&s;s Howe's mediation, which I cannot hope for on any other account&mdash;</P>
<P>My mediation, vile&s;t of men!&mdash;My mediation!&mdash;I ab|hor you!&mdash;From my &s;oul, I abhor you, vile&s;t of men! &mdash;Three or four times I repeated the&s;e words, &s;tammering too. &mdash; I was exce&s;&s;ively flutter'd.</P>
<P>You can call me nothing, Madam, &s;o bad as I will call my&s;elf. &mdash;I <HI>have</HI> been, indeed, the vile&s;t of men. &mdash; But now I am not &s;o.&mdash;Permit me (Every-body's eyes upon us) but one moment's audience&mdash; To exchange but ten words with you, deare&s;t Mi&s;s Howe&mdash;in who&s;e pre&s;ence
<PB N="270" REF="271">
you plea&s;e&mdash;for your dear friend's &s;ake&mdash;but ten words with you in the next apartment.</P>
<P>It is an in&s;ult upon me, to pre&s;ume, that I would ex|change <HI>one</HI> with you, if I could help it!&mdash;Out of my way, and my &s;ight, fellow!</P>
<P>And away I would have flung: But he took my hand. I was exce&s;&s;ively di&s;ordered. &mdash; Every-body's eyes more and more intent upon us.</P>
<P>Mr. Hickman, whom my mother had drawn on one &s;ide, to injoin him a patience, which, perhaps, need not to have been inforced, came up ju&s;t then, with my mother, who had him by his leading-&s;trings&mdash; By his &s;leeve, I &s;hould &s;ay.</P>
<P>Mr. Hickman, &s;aid the bold wretch, be my advocate but for ten words in the next apartment with Mi&s;s Howe, in your pre&s;ence, and in yours, Madam, to my mother.</P>
<P>Hear, Nancy, what he has to &s;ay to you. To get rid of him, hear his <HI>ten words.</HI></P>
<P>Excu&s;e me, Madam. His very breath&mdash; Unhand me, Sir!</P>
<P>He &s;igh'd, and look'd &mdash; O how the practi&s;ed villain &s;igh'd and look'd! He then let go my hand, with &s;uch a reverence in his manner, as brought blame upon me from &s;ome, that I would not hear him. &mdash;And this incen&s;ed me the more. O my dear, this man is a devil!&mdash;This man is indeed a devil!&mdash;So much patience, when he plea&s;es! So much gentlene&s;s!&mdash;Yet &s;o re&s;olute, &s;o per&s;i&s;ting, &s;o audacious!</P>
<P>I was going out of the a&s;&s;embl&eacute;e in great di&s;order. He was at the door as &s;oon as I.</P>
<P>How kind this is! &s;aid the wretch; and, ready to follow me, open'd the door for me.</P>
<P>I turned back, upon this, and, not knowing what I did, &s;napp'd my fan ju&s;t in his face, as he turned &s;hort upon me; and the powder flew from his wig.</P>
<P>Every-body &s;eemed as much plea&s;ed, as I was vexed.</P>
<P>He turned to Mr. Hickman, nettled at the powder fly|ing, and at the &s;miles of the company upon him; Mr. Hickman, you will be one of the happie&s;t men in the world, becau&s;e you are a <HI>good</HI> man, and will do nothing to provoke this pa&s;&s;ionate lady; and becau&s;e &s;he has too much good &s;en&s;e to be provoked without rea&s;on: But el&s;e, the Lord have mercy upon you!</P>
<P>This man, this Mr. Hickman, my dear, is too meek for
<PB N="271" REF="272">
a man. Indeed he is. &mdash;But my patient mother twits me, that her pa&s;&s;ionate daughter ought to like him <HI>the better</HI> for that. But meek men abroad are not always meek men at home. I have ob&s;erved that, in more in&s;tances than one: And if they <HI>were,</HI> I &s;hould not, I verily think, like them the better for being &s;o.</P>
<P>He then turned to my mother, re&s;olved to be even with <HI>her</HI> too: Where, good Madam, could Mi&s;s get all this &s;pirit?</P>
<P>The company round &s;miled; for I need not tell you, that my mother's high-&s;piritedne&s;s is pretty well known; and &s;he, &s;adly vexed, &s;aid, Sir, you treat me, as you do the re&s;t of the world&mdash;But&mdash;</P>
<P>I beg pardon, Madam, interrupted he: I might have &s;pared my que&s;tion&mdash;And in&s;tantly (I retiring to the other end of the hall) he turned to Mi&s;s Playford: What would I give, Mi&s;s, to hear you &s;ing that &s;ong you obliged us with at Lord M.'s?</P>
<P>He then, as if nothing had happened, fell into a con|ver&s;ation with her, and Mi&s;s D'Ollyffe, upon mu&s;ic; and whi&s;peringly &s;ung to Mi&s;s Playford, holding her two hands, with &s;uch airs of genteel unconcern, that it vexed me not a little, to look round, and &s;ee how plea&s;ed half the giddy fools of our Sex were with him, notwith&s;tanding his no|torious wicked character. &mdash; To this it is, that &s;uch vile fellows owe much of their vilene&s;s; whereas, if they found them&s;elves &s;hunned, and de&s;pi&s;ed, and treated as bea&s;ts of prey, as they are, they would run to their caverns, there howl by them&s;elves; and none but &s;uch as &s;ad accident, or unpitiable pre&s;umption, threw in their way, would &s;uffer by them.</P>
<P>He afterwards talked very &s;eriou&s;ly, at times, to Mr. Hickman: At <HI>times,</HI> I &s;ay; for it was with &s;uch breaks and &s;tarts of gaiety, turning to this lady, and to that, and then to Mr. Hickman again, re&s;uming a &s;erious or a gay air at plea&s;ure, that he took every-body's eye, the womens e&s;pecially; who were full of their whi&s;pering admirations of him, qualified with <HI>If's,</HI> and <HI>But's,</HI> and <HI>What pity's,</HI> and &s;uch &s;ort of &s;tuff, that &s;hewed, in their very di&s;prai&s;es, too much liking.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="273">Well may our Sex be the &s;port and ridicule of &s;uch liber|tines! Unthinking eye-governed creatures!&mdash;Would not a little reflection teach us, that a man of merit mu&s;t be a man of mode&s;ty, becau&s;e a diffident one? And that &s;uch a wretch as this mu&s;t have taken his degrees in wickedne&s;s, and gone thro' a cour&s;e of vilene&s;s, before he could arrive at this impenetrable effrontery? An effrontery which can proceed only from the light opinion he has of us and the high one of him&s;elf.</P>
<P>But our Sex are generally mode&s;t and ba&s;hful them&s;elves, and are too apt to con&s;ider that, which, in the main, is their principal grace, as a defect: And <HI>finely</HI> do they judge, when they think of &s;upplying that defect, by choo&s;ing a man, who cannot be a&s;hamed.</P>
<P>His di&s;cour&s;e to Mr. Hickman turned upon you, and his acknowleged injuries of you, tho' he could &s;o lightly &s;tart from the &s;ubject, and return to it.</P>
<P>I have no patience with &s;uch a devil &mdash; <HI>Man</HI> he cannot be called. To be &s;ure he would behave in the &s;ame man|ner any-where, or in any pre&s;ence, even at the altar it&s;elf, if a lady were with him there.</P>
<P>It &s;hall ever be a rule with me, that he who does not regard a woman with &s;ome degree of reverence, will look upon her, and occa&s;ionally <HI>treat</HI> her, with contempt.</P>
<P>He had the confidence to offer to take me out; but I ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed him, and &s;hunned him all I could, put|ting on the mo&s;t contemptuous airs: But nothing could mortify him.</P>
<P>I wi&s;hed twenty times I had not been there.</P>
<P>The gentlemen were as ready as I to wi&s;h he had broken his neck, rather than been pre&s;ent, I believe: For nobody was regarded but him. So little of the fop, yet &s;o elegant and rich in his dre&s;s: His per&s;on &s;o &s;pecious: His manner &s;o intrepid: So much meaning and penetration in his face: So much gaiety, yet &s;o little of the monkey: Tho' a tra|vell'd gentleman, yet no affectation; no mere toupet|man; but all manly; and his courage and wit, the one &s;o known, the other &s;o dreaded, you mu&s;t think the petits-ma&icirc;tres (of which there were four or five pre&s;ent) were mo&s;t deplorably off in his company: And one grave gentleman ob&s;erved to me (plea&s;ed to &s;ee me &s;hun him as I did)
<PB N="273" REF="274">
that the poet's ob&s;ervation was too true, That the genera|lity of ladies were <HI>Rakes in their hearts,</HI> or they could not be &s;o much taken with a man who had &s;o notorious a character.</P>
<P>I told him, The reflection both of the poet and applier was much too general, and made with more ill-nature than good manners.</P>
<P>When the wretch &s;aw how indu&s;triou&s;ly I avoided him (&s;hifting from one part of the hall to another), he at la&s;t boldly &s;tept up to me, as my mother and Mr. Hick|man were talking to me; and thus, before them, acco&s;ted me:</P>
<P>I beg your pardon, Madam; but, by your mother's leave, I mu&s;t have a few moments conver&s;ation with you, either here, or at your own hou&s;e; and I beg you will give me the opportunity.</P>
<P>Nancy, &s;aid my mother, hear what he has to &s;ay to you. In my pre&s;ence you may: And better in the ad|joining apartment, if it mu&s;t be, than to come to you at our own hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I retired to one corner of the hall, my mother following me, and he, taking Mr. Hickman under the arm, follow|ing her&mdash;Well, Sir, &s;aid I, what have you to &s;ay?&mdash;Tell me <HI>here.</HI></P>
<P>I have been telling Mr. Hickman, &s;aid he, how much I am concerned for the injuries I have done to the mo&s;t ex|cellent woman in the world: And yet, that &s;he obtained &s;uch a glorious triumph over me the la&s;t time I had the honour to &s;ee her, as, with my penitence, ought to have qualified her former re&s;entments: But that I will, with all my &s;oul, enter into any mea&s;ures to obtain her forgivene&s;s of me. My cou&s;ins Montague have told you this. Lady Betty, and Lady Sarah, and my Lord M. are engaged for my honour. I know your power with the dear creature. My cou&s;ins told me, you gave them hopes you would u&s;e it in my behalf. My Lord M. and his two &s;i&s;ters are im|patiently expecting the fruits of it. You mu&s;t have heard from her before now: I hope you have. And will you be &s;o good, as to tell me, if I may have any hopes?</P>
<P>If I mu&s;t &s;peak on this &s;ubject&punc; Let me tell you, that you have broken her heart. You know not the value of
<PB N="274" REF="275">
the lady you have injured. You de&s;erve her not. And &s;he de&s;pi&s;es you, as &s;he ought.</P>
<P>Dear Mi&s;s Howe, mingle not pa&s;&s;ion with denunciations &s;o &s;evere. I mu&s;t know my fate. I will go abroad once more, if I find her ab&s;olutely irreconcileable. But I hope &s;he will give me leave to attend upon her, to know my doom from her own mouth.</P>
<P>It would be death immediate for her to &s;ee you. And what mu&s;t <HI>You</HI> be, to be able to look her in the face?</P>
<P>I then reproached him (with vehemence enough, you may believe) on his ba&s;ene&s;s, and the evils he had made you &s;uffer: The di&s;tre&s;s he had reduced you to: All your friends made your enemies: The vile hou&s;e he had carried you to: Hinted at his villainous arts; the dreadful arre&s;t: And told him of your pre&s;ent deplorable illne&s;s, and re|&s;olution to die rather than have him.</P>
<P>He vindicated not any part of his conduct, but that of the arre&s;t; and &s;o &s;olemnly prote&s;ted his &s;orrow for his u&s;age of you, accu&s;ing him&s;elf in the free&s;t manner, and by <HI>de&s;erved</HI> appellations, that I promi&s;ed to lay before you this part of our conver&s;ation. And now you have it.</P>
<P>My mother, as well as Mr. Hickman, believes, from what pa&s;&s;ed on this occa&s;ion, that he is touched in con|&s;cience for the wrongs he has done you: But, by his whole behaviour, I mu&s;t own, it &s;eems to me, that nothing can touch him for half an hour together. Yet I have no doubt, that he would willingly marry you; and it piques his pride, I could &s;ee, that he &s;hould be denied: As it did mine, that &s;uch a wretch had dared to think it in his power to have &s;uch a woman whenever he plea&s;ed; and that it mu&s;t be accounted a conde&s;cen&s;ion, and matter of obliga|tion (by all his own family at lea&s;t), that he would vouch|&s;afe to think of marriage.</P>
<P>Now, my dear, you have the rea&s;on before you, why I &s;u&s;pend the deci&s;ive Negative to the ladies of his family: My mother, Mi&s;s Lloyd, and Mi&s;s Biddulph, who were inqui&s;itive after the &s;ubject of our retired conver&s;ation, and who&s;e curio&s;ity I thought it was right, in &s;ome degree, to gratify (e&s;pecially as tho&s;e young ladies are of our &s;elect acquaintance), are all of opinion, that you &s;hould be his.</P>
<P>You will let Mr. Hickman know your whole mind;
<PB N="275" REF="276">
and when he acquaints me with it, I will tell you all my own.</P>
<P>Mean time, may the news he will bring me of the &s;tate of your health, be favourable! prays, with the utmo&s;t fervency,</P>

<P>AFTER I have thankfully acknowleged your favour in &s;ending Mr. Hickman to vi&s;it me before you &s;et out upon your intended journey, I mu&s;t chide you (in the &s;incerity of that faithful love, which could not be the love it is, if it would not admit of that <HI>cementing</HI> freedom) for &s;u&s;pending the deci&s;ive Negative, which, upon &s;uch full deliberation, I had intreated you to give to Mr. Lovelace's relations.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry, that I am obliged to <HI>repeat</HI> to you, my dear, who know me &s;o well, that, were I &s;ure I &s;hould live <HI>many years,</HI> I would not have Mr. Lovelace: Much le&s;s can I think of him, as it is probable I may not live <HI>one.</HI></P>
<P>As to the <HI>world,</HI> and its <HI>cen&s;ures,</HI> you know, my dear, that, however de&s;irous I always was of a fair fame, yet I never thought it right to give more than a <HI>&s;econd place</HI> to the world's opinion. The challenges made to Mr. Lovelace by Mi&s;s D'Oily, in public company, are a fre&s;h proof, that I have lo&s;t my reputation: And what advantage would it be to me, were it retrievable, and were I to live long, if I could not acquit my&s;elf to <HI>my&s;elf?</HI></P>
<P>Having, in my former, &s;aid &s;o much on the freedoms you have taken with my friends, I &s;hall &s;ay the le&s;s now: But <HI>your</HI> hint, that &s;omething el&s;e has newly pa&s;&s;ed be|tween &s;ome of them and you, gives me great concern, and that as well for <HI>my own</HI> &s;ake, as for <HI>theirs;</HI> &s;ince it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily incen&s;e them again&s;t me. I wi&s;h, my dear, that I had been left to my own cour&s;e on an occa&s;ion &s;o <HI>v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ry</HI> intere&s;ting to my&s;elf. But &s;ince what is done cannot be helped, I mu&s;t abide the con&s;equences: Yet I dread,
<PB N="276" REF="277">
<HI>more than before,</HI> what may be my &s;i&s;ter's an&s;wer, if an an&s;wer be at all vouch&s;afed.</P>
<P>Will you give me leave, my dear, to clo&s;e this &s;ubject with one remark?&mdash;It is this: That my beloved friend, in points where her own laudable <HI>zeal</HI> is concerned, has ever &s;eemed more ready to fly from the <HI>rebuke,</HI> than the <HI>fault.</HI> If you will excu&s;e this freedom, I will acknowlege thus far in favour of your way of thinking, as to the con|duct of &s;ome parents in the&s;e nice ca&s;es, That <HI>indi&s;creet</HI> op|po&s;ition does frequently as much mi&s;chief as <HI>giddy</HI> love.</P>
<P>As to the invitation you are &s;o kind as to give me, to remove privately into your neighbourhood, I have told Mr. Hickman, that I will con&s;ider of it: But believe, if you will be &s;o good as to excu&s;e me, that I &s;hall not ac|cept of it, even &s;hould I be <HI>able</HI> to remove. I will give you my rea&s;ons for declining it; and &s;o I ought, when both my love, and my gratitude, would make a vi&s;it now-and-then, from my dear Mi&s;s Howe, the mo&s;t con&s;olatory thing in the world to me.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know then, that this great town, wicked as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is, wants not opportunities of being better; having daily prayers at &s;everal churches in it; and I am de&s;irous, as my &s;trength will admit, to embrace tho&s;e opportunities. The method I have propo&s;ed to my&s;elf (and was beginning to practi&s;e, when that cruel arre&s;t deprived me both of free|dom and &s;trength), is this: When I was di&s;po&s;ed to gentle exerci&s;e, I took a chair to St. Dun&s;tan's church in Fleet-&s;treet, where are prayers at &s;even in the morning: I pro|po&s;ed, if the weather favoured, to walk (if not, to take chair) to Lincoln's-Inn chapel; where, at eleven in the morning, and at five in the afternoon, are the &s;ame de&s;irable opportunities; and at other times to go no farther that Covent-Garden church, where are early morning prayers likewi&s;e.</P>
<P>This method, pur&s;ued, I doubt not, will greatly help as it has already done, to calm my di&s;turbed thoughts, and to bring me to that perfect re&s;ignation, which I a&s;pire af|ter: For I mu&s;t own, my dear, that &s;ometimes &s;till my griefs, and my reflections, are too heavy for me; and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the aid I can draw from <HI>religious duties</HI> is hardly &s;ufficien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to &s;upport my &s;taggering rea&s;on. I am a very young
<PB N="277" REF="278">
creature, you know, my dear, to be left to my own con|duct, in &s;uch circum&s;tances as I am in.</P>
<P>Another rea&s;on why I choo&s;e not to go down into your neighbourhood, is, The di&s;plea&s;ure that might ari&s;e on my account between your mother and you.</P>
<P>If, indeed, you were actually married, and the worthy man (who would then have a title to all your regard) were earne&s;tly de&s;irous of my near neighbourhood, I know not what I might do: For altho' I might not perhaps intend to give up my other important rea&s;ons at the <HI>time</HI> I &s;hould make you a congratulatory vi&s;it, yet I might not know how to de|ny my&s;elf the plea&s;ure of continuing near you, when there.</P>
<P>I &s;end you inclo&s;ed the copy of my letter to my &s;i&s;ter. I hope it will be thought to be written with a true penitent &s;pirit; for indeed it is. I de&s;ire that you will not think I &s;toop too low in it; &s;ince there can be no &s;uch thing as that, in a child, to parents whom &s;he has unhappily offended.</P>
<P>But if &s;till (perhaps more di&s;gu&s;ted than before at your freedom with them) they &s;hould pa&s;s it by with the con|tempt of &s;ilence (for I have not yet been favoured with an an&s;wer), I mu&s;t learn to think it right in them &s;o to do; e&s;pecially as it is my fir&s;t direct application: For I have often cen&s;ured the boldne&s;s of tho&s;e, who, applying for a favour, which it is in a per&s;on's option to grant, or to re|fu&s;e, take the liberty of being offended, if they are not gratified; as if the <HI>petitioned-to</HI> had not as good a right to reject, as the <HI>petitioner</HI> to a&s;k.</P>
<P>But if my letter &s;hould be an&s;wered, and that in &s;uch terms as will make me loth to communicate it to &s;o warm a friend&mdash;you mu&s;t not, my dear, take upon you to cen|&s;ure my relations; but allow for them, as they know not what I have &s;uffered; as being filled with <HI>ju&s;t</HI> re&s;entments again&s;t me (<HI>ju&s;t</HI> to them, if they <HI>think</HI> them ju&s;t); and as not being able to judge of the reality of my penitence.</P>
<P>And after all, what can they do for me?&mdash;They can only pity me: And what will that do, but augment their own <HI>grief;</HI> to which, at pre&s;ent, their <HI>re&s;entment</HI> is an allevia|tion? For can they, by their pity, re&s;tore to me my lo&s;t re|putation? Can they, by it, purcha&s;e a &s;ponge, that will wipe out from the year the pa&s;t fatal five months of my life <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">She takes in the time that &s;he appointed to meet Mr. Lovelace.</NOTE>?</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="279">Your account of the gay, unconcerned behaviour of Mr. Lovelace, at the Colonel's, does not &s;urpri&s;e me at all, af|ter I am told, that he had the intrepidity to go thither, knowing who were <HI>invited</HI> and <HI>expected.</HI>&mdash;Only this, my dear, I really wonder at, that Mi&s;s Howe could imagine, that I could have a thought of &s;uch a man for a hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Poor wretch! I pity him, to &s;ee him fluttering about; abu&s;ing talents that were given him for excellent pur|po&s;es; taking courage for wit; and dancing, fearle&s;s of danger, on the edge of a precipice!</P>
<P>But, indeed, his threatening to &s;ee me, mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly alarms and &s;hocks me. I cannot but hope, that I never, never more &s;hall &s;ee him in this world.</P>
<P>Since you are &s;o loth, my dear, to &s;end the de&s;ired Ne|gative to the ladies of his family, I will only trouble you to tran&s;mit the letter I &s;hall inclo&s;e for that purpo&s;e; di|rected indeed to your&s;elf, becau&s;e it was to you that tho&s;e ladies applied them&s;elves on this occa&s;ion; but to be &s;ent by you to any one of the ladies, at your own choice.</P>
<P>I commend my&s;elf, my deare&s;t Mi&s;s Howe, to your prayers; and conclude with repeated thanks for &s;ending Mr. Hickman to me; and with wi&s;hes for your health and happine&s;s, and for the &s;peedy celebration of your nuptials,</P>

<P>SINCE you &s;eem loth to acquie&s;ce in my determined re&s;olution, &s;ignified to you as &s;oon as I was able to hold a pen, I beg the favour of you, by this, or by any other way you think mo&s;t proper, to acquaint the worthy Ladies who have applied to you in behalf of their rela|tion, that, altho' I am infinitely obliged to their generous opinion of me, yet I cannot con&s;ent to <HI>&s;anctify,</HI> as I may &s;ay, Mr. Lovelace's repeated breaches of all moral &s;anctions, and hazard my <HI>future</HI> happine&s;s by an union with a man,

<P>Be plea&s;ed to acquaint them, that I deceive my&s;elf, if my re&s;olution on this head (however ingratefully, and even inhumanly, he has treated me) be not owing more to <HI>principle</HI> than <HI>pa&s;&s;ion.</HI> Nor can I give a &s;tronger proof of the truth of this a&s;&s;urance, than by declaring, that I <HI>can</HI> and <HI>will</HI> forgive him, on this one ea&s;y condition, <HI>That he will never mole&s;t me more.</HI></P>
<P>In whatever way you choo&s;e to make this declaration, be plea&s;ed to let my mo&s;t re&s;pectful compliments to the Ladies of the noble family, and to my Lord M. accom|pany it. And do you, my dear, believe, that I &s;hall be, to the la&s;t moment of my life,</P>

<P>I Have three letters of thine to take notice of <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Letters lxxi.lxxii.lxxiii.</NOTE>: But am divided in my mind, whether to quarrel with thee, on thy unmerciful reflections; or to thank thee, for thy acceptable particularity and diligence. But &s;everal of my &s;weet dears have I, indeed, in my time made to cry and laugh in a breath; nay, one &s;ide of their pretty faces laugh, before the cry could go off of the other: Why may I not, therefore, cur&s;e and applaud thee in the &s;ame moment? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o take both in one: And what follows, as it &s;hall ri&s;e from my pen.</P>
<P>How often have I ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;&s;ed my &s;ins again&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is excellent creature?&mdash;Yet thou never &s;pare&s;t me, altho' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> bad a man as my&s;elf. Since then, I get &s;o little by my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">fe&s;&s;ions, I had a good mind to try to defend my&s;elf; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd that not only from antient and modern &s;tory, but from
<PB N="280" REF="281">
common practice; and yet avoid repeating any-thing I have &s;ugge&s;ted before in my own behalf.</P>
<P>I am in a humour to play the fool with my pen: Briefly then, from antient &s;tory fir&s;t:&mdash;Do&s;t thou not think, that I am as much intitled to forgivene&s;s on Mi&s;s Harlowe's account, as Virgil's hero was on Queen Dido's? For what an ingrateful varlet was that vagabond to the <HI>ho&s;pitable</HI> prince&s;s, who had <HI>willingly</HI> conferred upon him the la&s;t favour?&mdash;Stealing away (whence, I &s;uppo&s;e, the ironical phra&s;e of <HI>Tru&s;ty Trojan</HI> to this day) like a thief; pretend|edly indeed at the command of the gods; but could that be, when the errand he went upon was to rob other princes, not only of their dominions, but of their lives?&mdash;Yet this fellow is, at every word, the <HI>pius</HI> Aeneas, with the im|mortal bard who celebrates him.</P>
<P>Should Mi&s;s Harlowe even break her heart (which Hea|ven forbid!) for the u&s;age &s;he has received (to &s;ay nothing of her di&s;appointed pride, to which her death would be attributable, more than to rea&s;on) what compari&s;on will <HI>her</HI> fate hold to Queen Dido's? And have I half the obli|gation to her, that Aeneas had to the Queen of Carthage? The latter placing a confidence, the former none, in he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> man? &mdash; Then, whom <HI>el&s;e</HI> have I robbed? Whom <HI>el&s;e</HI> have I injured? Her brother's worthle&s;s life I gave him, in&s;tead of taking any man's, as the Trojan vagabond did the lives of thou&s;ands. Why then &s;hould it not be the <HI>pius</HI> Lovelace, as well as the <HI>pius</HI> Aeneas? For, do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> thou think, had a conflagration happened, and had it bee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in my power, that I would not have &s;aved my old Anchi|&s;es (as he did his from the Ilion bonfire) even at the ex|pence of my Cre&uuml;&s;a, had I had a wife of that name?</P>
<P>But for a more modern in&s;tance in my favour&mdash;Have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> u&s;ed Mi&s;s Harlowe, as our famous Maiden-Queen, as &s;he was called, u&s;ed one of her own blood, a Si&s;ter-Queen&punc; who threw her&s;elf into her protection from her rebel-&s;ub|jects; and whom &s;he detained pri&s;oner eighteen years, and at la&s;t cut off her head? Yet (credited by wor&s;e and weake<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> reigns, a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion four deep) do not hone&s;t Prote&s;tant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> pronounce <HI>her</HI> pious too?&mdash;And call her particularly <HI>th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> Queen?</P>
<P>As to <HI>common practice</HI>&mdash;Who, let me a&s;k, that has it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="281" REF="282">
his power to gratify a predominant pa&s;&s;ion, be it what it will, denies him&s;elf the gratification?&mdash;Leaving it to cooler deliberation; and, if he be a great man, to his flatterers; to find a rea&s;on for it afterwards?</P>
<P>Then, as to the wor&s;t part of my treatment of this lady &mdash; How many men are there, who, as well as I, have &s;ought, by intoxicating liquors, fir&s;t to inebriate, then to &s;ubdue? What &s;ignifies what the <HI>potations</HI> were, when the &s;ame end was in view?</P>
<P>Let me tell thee, upon the whole, that neither the Queen of Carthage, nor the Queen of Scots, would have thought they had any rea&s;on to complain of cruelty, had they been u&s;ed no wor&s;e than I have u&s;ed the Queen of my heart: And then do I not a&s;pire with my whole &s;oul to repair by marriage? Would the <HI>pius</HI> Aeneas, thinke&s;t thou, have done &s;uch a piece of ju&s;tice by Dido, had &s;he lived?</P>
<P>Come, come, Belford, let people run away with no|tions as they will, I am <HI>comparatively</HI> a very innocent man. And if by the&s;e, and other like rea&s;onings, I have quieted my own con&s;cience, a great end is an&s;wered. What have I to do with the world?</P>
<P>And now I &s;it me peaceably down to con&s;ider thy letters.</P>
<P>I hope thy pleas in my favour <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See p. 256, 257.</NOTE>, when &s;he gave thee (&s;o generou&s;ly gave thee), for me, my letters, were urged with an hone&s;t energy. But I &s;u&s;pect thee much for be|ing too ready to give up thy client. Then thou ha&s;t &s;uch a mi&s;giving a&s;pect; an a&s;pect, rather inviting rejection, than carrying per&s;ua&s;ion with it; and art &s;uch an he&s;itate|ing, &s;uch an humming and hawing caitiff; that I &s;hall at|tribute my failure, if I do fail, rather to the inability and ill looks of my advocate, than to my cau&s;e. Again, Thou art deprived of the force men of our ca&s;t give to argu|ments; for &s;he won't let thee <HI>&s;wear!</HI> &mdash; Art moreover a very heavy, thoughtle&s;s fellow; tolerable only at a &s;econd rebound; a horrid dunce at the <HI>impromptu.</HI> The&s;e, en|countering with &s;uch a lady, are great di&s;advantages.&mdash; And &s;till a greater is thy balancing (as thou do&s;t at pre&s;ent) between old Rakery and new Reformation: Since this puts thee into the &s;ame &s;ituation with her, as they told me at Leip&s;ick Martin Luther was in, at the fir&s;t public di&s;pute
<PB N="282" REF="283">
which he held, in defence of his &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>new</HI> doctrines, with Eckius. For Martin was then but a lin&s;ey-wol&s;ey reformer. He retained &s;ome dogma, which, by natural con&s;equence, made others that he held untenable. So that Eckius, in &s;ome points, had the better of him. But, from that time, he made clear work, renouncing all that &s;tood in his way: And then his doctrines ran upon all fours. He was never puzzled afterwards; and could boldly declare, that he would defend them in the face of angels and men; and to his friends, who would have di&s;&s;uaded him from venturing to appear before the emperor Charles the Fifth at Spires, <HI>That, were there as many devils at Spires, as tiles upon the hou&s;es, he would go.</HI> An an&s;wer that is admired by every Prote&s;tant Saxon to this day.</P>
<P>Since then thy unhappy aukwardne&s;s de&s;troys the force of thy arguments, I think thou had&s;t better (for the pre|&s;ent, however) forbear to urge her on the &s;ubject of ac|cepting the reparation I offer; le&s;t the continual teazing of her to forgive me &s;hould but &s;trengthen her in her denials of forgivene&s;s; till, for <HI>con&s;i&s;tency</HI> &s;ake, &s;he'll be forced to adhere to a re&s;olution &s;o often avowed: Whereas, if left to her&s;elf, a little time, and better health, which will bring on better &s;pirits, will give her quicker re&s;entments; tho&s;e quicker re&s;entments will lead her into vehemence; that vehemence will &s;ub&s;ide, and turn into expo&s;tulation and parley: My friends will then interpo&s;e, and guaranty for me: And all our trouble on both &s;ides will be over.&mdash; Such is the natural cour&s;e of things.</P>
<P>I cannot endure thee for thy hopele&s;ne&s;s in the lady's recovery <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See p. 257.</NOTE>; and that in contradiction to the Doctor and Apothecary.</P>
<P><HI>Time,</HI> in the words of Congreve, thou &s;ay&s;t, <HI>will give increa&s;e to her afflictions.</HI> But why &s;o? Knowe&s;t thou not, that tho&s;e words (&s;o contrary to common experience) were applied to the ca&s;e of a per&s;on, while pa&s;&s;ion was in its full vigour?&mdash;At &s;uch a time, every-one in a heavy grief thinks the &s;ame: But as Enthu&s;ia&s;ts do by Scripture, &s;o do&s;t thou by the poets thou ha&s;t read: Any-thing that carries the mo&s;t di&s;tant allu&s;ion from <HI>either,</HI> to the ca&s;e in hand, is put down by both for go&s;pel, however incongruous to
<PB N="283" REF="284">
the general &s;cope of either, and to <HI>that ca&s;e.</HI> So once, in a pulpit, I heard one of the former very vehemently de|clare him&s;elf to be a <HI>dead dog;</HI> when every man, woman, and child, were convinced to the contrary by his howling.</P>
<P>I can tell thee, that, if nothing el&s;e will do, I am deter|mined, in &s;pite of thy bu&s;kin-airs, and of thy engagements for me to the contrary, to &s;ee her my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Face to face have I known many a quarrel made up, which di&s;tance would have kept alive, and widened. Thou wilt be a madder Jack than him in the Tale of a Tub, if thou give&s;t an active oppo&s;ition to this interview.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I cannot bear the thought, that a lady, whom once I had bound to me in the &s;ilken cords of love, &s;hould &s;lip through my fingers, and be able, while <HI>my</HI> heart flames out with a violent pa&s;&s;ion for her, to de&s;pi&s;e me, and to &s;et both love and me at defiance. Thou can&s;t not imagine how much I envy <HI>thee,</HI> and her <HI>Doctor,</HI> and her <HI>Apothe|cary,</HI> and every-one whom I hear of being admitted to her pre&s;ence and conver&s;ation; and wi&s;h to be the <HI>one</HI> or the <HI>other</HI> in turn.</P>
<P>Wherefore, if nothing el&s;e will do, I <HI>will</HI> &s;ee her. I'll tell thee of an admirable expedient, ju&s;t come cro&s;s me, to &s;ave <HI>thy</HI> promi&s;e, and <HI>my own.</HI></P>
<P>Mrs. Lovick, you &s;ay, is a good woman: If the lady be wor&s;e, &s;he &s;hall advi&s;e her to &s;end for a par&s;on to pray by her: Unknown to her, unknown to the lady, unknown to <HI>thee</HI> (for &s;o it may pa&s;s), I will contrive to be the man, petticoated out, and ve&s;ted in a gown and ca&s;&s;ock. I once, for a certain purpo&s;e, did a&s;&s;ume the canonicals; and I was thought to make a fine &s;leek appearance, my broad ro&s;e-bound beaver became me <HI>mightily,</HI> and I was much admired upon the whole, by all who &s;aw me.</P>
<P>Methinks it mu&s;t be charmingly apropos to &s;ee me kneel|ing down by her bed-&s;ide (I am &s;ure I &s;hall pray heartily), beginning out of the Common-prayer book the Sick Office for the re&s;toration of the langui&s;hing lady, and concluding with an exhortation to charity and forgivene&s;s for my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I will con&s;ider of this matter. But, in whatever &s;hape I &s;hall choo&s;e to appear, of this thou may&s;t a&s;&s;ure thy|&s;elf, I will appri&s;e thee before-hand of my determined-upon vi&s;it, that thou maye&s;t contrive to be out of the way,
<PB N="284" REF="285">
and to know nothing of the matter. This will &s;ave <HI>thy</HI> word; and, as to <HI>mine,</HI> can &s;he think wor&s;e of me than &s;he does at pre&s;ent?</P>
<P>An indi&s;pen&s;able of true love and profound re&s;pect, in thy wi&s;e opinion <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See p. 251.</NOTE>, is ab&s;urdity or aukwardne&s;s, &mdash;'Tis &s;urpri&s;ing, that <HI>thou</HI> &s;hould&s;t be one of tho&s;e partial mor|tals, who take their mea&s;ures of right and wrong from what they find <HI>them&s;elves to be,</HI> and cannot <HI>help being!</HI>&mdash; So aukwardne&s;s is a perfection in the aukward!&mdash;At this rate, no man ever can be in the wrong. But I in&s;i&s;t upon it, that an aukward fellow will do every-thing aukwardly: And if he be like thee, will rack his unmeaning brain for excu&s;es as aukward as his fir&s;t fault. Re&s;pectful Love is an in&s;pirer of actions worthy of it&s;elf; and he who can|not &s;hew it, where he mo&s;t means it, manife&s;ts, that he is an unpolite rough creature, a perfect Belford, and has it not in him.</P>
<P>But here thou'lt throw out that notable wittici&s;m, that my out&s;ide is the be&s;t of <HI>me,</HI> thine the wor&s;t of <HI>thee;</HI> and that, if I &s;et about mending my mind, thou wilt mend thy appearance.</P>
<P>But, pr'ythee, Jack, don't &s;tay for <HI>that;</HI> but &s;et about thy amendment in dre&s;s, when thou leave&s;t off thy mourn|ing; for why &s;hould&s;t thou prepo&s;&s;e&s;s in thy disfavour all tho&s;e who never &s;aw thee before? &mdash; It is hard to remove early-taken prejudices, whether of liking or di&s;ta&s;te: Peo|ple will <HI>hunt,</HI> as I may &s;ay, for rea&s;ons to confirm fir&s;t im|pre&s;&s;ions, in compliment to their own &s;agacity: Nor is it every mind that has the ingenuity to confe&s;s it&s;elf mi&s;|taken, when it finds it&s;elf to be wrong. Thou thy&s;elf art an adept in the pretended &s;cience of reading of men; and, whenever thou art out, wilt &s;tudy to find &s;ome rea&s;ons why it was more probable that thou &s;hould&s;t have been right; and wilt watch every motion and action, and every word and &s;entiment, in the per&s;on thou ha&s;t once cen&s;ured, for proofs, in order to help thee to revive and maintain thy fir&s;t opinion. And, indeed, as thou &s;eldom erre&s;t on the <HI>favourable &s;ide,</HI> human nature is &s;o vile a thing, that thou art likely to be right five times in &s;ix, on the <HI>other:</HI> And perhaps it is but gue&s;&s;ing of others, by what thou
<PB N="285" REF="286">
finde&s;t in thy own heart, to have rea&s;on to compliment thy&s;elf on thy penetration.</P>
<P>Here is preachment for thy preachment: And, I hope, if thou like&s;t thy own, thou wilt thank me for mine; the rather, as thou may'&s;t be the better for it, if thou wilt: Since it is calculated for thy own meridian.</P>
<P>Well, but the lady refers my de&s;tiny to the letter &s;he has written, actually written, to Mi&s;s Howe; to whom, it &s;eems, &s;he has given her rea&s;ons, why &s;he will not have me. I long to know the contents of this letter: But am in great hopes, that &s;he has &s;o expre&s;&s;ed her denials, as &s;hall give room to think, &s;he only wants to be per&s;uaded to the con|trary, in order to reconcile her&s;elf to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>I could make &s;ome pretty ob&s;ervations upon one or two places of the lady's meditation: But, wicked as I am thought to be, I never was &s;o abandoned, as to turn into ridicule, or even to treat with levity, things &s;acred. I think it the highe&s;t degree of ill manners, to je&s;t upon tho&s;e &s;ubjects, which the world in general look upon with veneration, and call divine. I would not even treat the mythology of the Heathen, to a Heathen, with the ridicule that perhaps would fairly lie from &s;ome of the ab&s;urdities that &s;trike every common ob&s;erver. Nor, when at Rome, and in other popi&s;h countries, did I ever behave &s;hockingly at tho&s;e ceremonies which I thought very extraordinary: For I &s;aw &s;ome people affected, and &s;eemingly edified, by them; and I contented my&s;elf to think, tho' they were be|yond my comprehen&s;ion, that, if they an&s;wered any good end to the <HI>many,</HI> there was religion enough in them, or civil policy at lea&s;t, to exempt them from the ridicule of even a <HI>bad</HI> man, who had common &s;en&s;e, and good manners.</P>
<P>For the like rea&s;on, I have never given noi&s;y or tumul|tuous in&s;tances of di&s;like to a new Play, if I thought it ever &s;o indifferent: For, I concluded fir&s;t, that every one was intitled to &s;ee quietly what he paid for: And, next, as the Theatre (the epitome of the world) con&s;i&s;ted of Pit, Boxes, and Gallery, it was hard, I thought, if there could be &s;uch a performance exhibited, as would not plea&s;e &s;ome|body in that mixed multitude: And, if it did, tho&s;e &s;ome|bodies
<PB N="286" REF="287">
had as much right to enjoy their own judgments un|di&s;turbedly, as I had to enjoy mine.</P>
<P>This was <HI>my</HI> way of &s;hewing my di&s;approbation; I ne|ver went again. And as a man is at his option, whether he will go to a Play, or not, he has not the &s;ame excu&s;e for expre&s;&s;ing his di&s;like clamorou&s;ly, as if he were <HI>compelled</HI> to &s;ee it.</P>
<P>I have ever, thou knowe&s;t, declared again&s;t tho&s;e &s;hal|low libertines, who could not make out their preten&s;ions to wit, but on two &s;ubjects, to which every man of <HI>tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> wit will &s;corn to be beholden: PROFANENESS and OBSCE|NITY, I mean; which mu&s;t &s;hock the ears of every man or woman of &s;en&s;e, without an&s;wering any end, but of &s;hewing a very low and abandoned nature. And, till I came acquainted with the brutal Mowbray (no great prai&s;e to my&s;elf from &s;uch a tutor), I was far from making &s;o free, as I now do, with oaths and cur&s;es; for then I was forced to out&s;wear him &s;ometimes, to keep him in his al|legiance to me his general: Nay, I often check my&s;elf to my&s;elf, for this empty, unprofitable liberty of &s;peech; in which we are outdone by the &s;ons of the common &s;ewer&punc;</P>
<P>All my vice is women, and the love of plots and in|trigues; and I cannot but wonder, how I fell into tho&s;e &s;hocking freedoms of &s;peech; &s;ince, generally-&s;peaking, they are far from helping forward my main end: Only, now-and-then, indeed, a little novice ri&s;es to one's notice, who &s;eems to think dre&s;s, and oaths, and cur&s;es, the diagno|&s;tics of the raki&s;h &s;pirit &s;he is inclined to favour: And, in|deed, they are the only qualifications, that &s;ome, who are called Rakes, and Pretty fellows, have to boa&s;t of. But what mu&s;t the women be, who can be attracted by &s;uch <HI>empty-&s;oul'd</HI> profligates? &mdash; Since wickedne&s;s <HI>with</HI> wit is hardly excu&s;able; but, <HI>without</HI> it, is equally &s;hocking and contemptible.</P>
<P>There again is preachment for thy preachment; and thou wilt be apt to think, that I am reforming too: But no &s;uch matter. If this were <HI>new light</HI> darting in upon me, as thy morality &s;eems to be to thee, &s;omething of this kind might be apprehended: But this was <HI>always</HI> my way of thinking; and I defy thee, or any of thy brethren, to name a time, when I have either ridiculed Religion, or
<PB N="287" REF="288">
talked ob&s;cenely. On the contrary, thou knowe&s;t how often I have checked that Bear in love-matters, Mowbray, and the finical Tourville, and thy&s;elf too, for what ye have called the double-entendre. In <HI>love,</HI> as in points that required a <HI>manly re&s;entment,</HI> it has always been my maxim, to <HI>act,</HI> rather than <HI>talk;</HI> and I do a&s;&s;ure thee, as to the fir&s;t, the ladies them&s;elves will excu&s;e the one &s;ooner than the other.</P>
<P>As to the admiration thou expre&s;&s;e&s;t for the books of Scripture, thou art certainly right in it. But 'tis &s;trange to me, that thou wert ignorant of their beauty, and noble &s;implicity, till now. Their antiquity always made me reverence them: And how was it po&s;&s;ible that thou could&s;t not, for that rea&s;on, if for no other, give them a peru&s;al?</P>
<P>I'll tell thee a &s;hort &s;tory, which I had from my tutor, admoni&s;hing me again&s;t expo&s;ing my&s;elf by <HI>ignorant won|der,</HI> when I &s;hould quit college, go to town, or travel.</P>
<Q><P>The fir&s;t time Dryden's Alexander's Fea&s;t fell into his hands, he told me, he was prodigiou&s;ly charmed with it: And, having never heard any-body &s;peak of it before, thought, as thou do&s;t of the Bible, that he had made a new di&s;covery.</P>
<P>He ha&s;tened to an appointment which he had with &s;e|veral wits (for he was then in town), one of whom was a noted Critic, who, according to him, had more merit than good fortune; for all the little nibblers in wit, who&s;e writings would not &s;tand the te&s;t of critici&s;m, made it, he &s;aid, a common cau&s;e to run him down, as men would a mad dog.</P>
<P>The young gentleman (for young he then was) &s;et forth magnificently in the prai&s;es of that inimitable per|formance; and gave him&s;elf airs of &s;econd-hand merit, for finding out its beauties.</P>
<P>The old Bard heard him out with a &s;mile, which the collegian took for approbation, till he &s;poke; and then it was in the&s;e mortifying words: 'Sdeath, Sir, where have you lived till now, or with what &s;ort of company have you conver&s;ed, young as you are, that you have never before heard of the fine&s;t piece in the Engli&s;h lan|guage?</P></Q>
<P>This &s;tory had &s;uch an effect upon <HI>me,</HI> who had ever a
<PB N="288" REF="289">
proud heart, and wanted to be thought a clever fellow, that, in order to avoid the like di&s;grace, I laid down two rules to my&s;elf. The fir&s;t, whenever I went into company where there were &s;trangers, to hear every-one of them &s;peak, before I gave my&s;elf liberty to prate: The other, if I found any of them above my match, to give up all title to new di&s;coveries, contenting my&s;elf to prai&s;e what they prai&s;ed, as beauties familiar to me, tho' I had never heard of them before. And &s;o, by degrees, I got the reputa|tion of a wit my&s;elf: And when I threw off all re&s;traint, and books, and learned conver&s;ation, and fell in with &s;ome of our brethren who are now wandering in Erebus, and with &s;uch others as Belton, Mowbray, Tourville, and thy|&s;elf, I &s;et up on my own &s;tock; and, like what we have been told of Sir Richard, in his latter days, valued my&s;elf on being the emperor of the company; for, having fa|thomed the depth of them all, and afraid of no rival but thee, whom al&s;o I had got a little under (by my gaiety and promptitude at lea&s;t), I proudly, like Addi&s;on's Cato, delighted to give laws to my little &s;enate.</P>
<P>Proceed with thee by-and-by.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXXVIII. <HI>Mr.</HI> LOVELACE, <HI>To</HI> JOHN BELFORD, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>BUT now I have cleared my&s;elf of any intentional le|vity on occa&s;ion of my beloved's meditation; which, as thou ob&s;erve&s;t, is finely &s;uited to her ca&s;e (that is to &s;ay, as &s;he and you have drawn her ca&s;e); I cannot, help ex|pre&s;&s;ing my plea&s;ure, that by one or two ver&s;es of it (the <HI>arrow,</HI> Jack, and <HI>what &s;he feared being come upon her!</HI>) I am encouraged to hope, what it will be very &s;urpri&s;ing to me if it do not happen: That is, in plain Engli&s;h, that the dear creature is in the way to be a mamma.</P>
<P>This cur&s;ed arre&s;t, becau&s;e of the ill effects the terror might have had upon her, in that hoped-for circum&s;tance, has concerned me more than on any other account. It would be the pride of my life to prove, in this charming fro&s;t-piece, the triumph of nature over principle, and to have a young Love<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ace by &s;uch an angel: And then, for its &s;ake, I am confident &s;he will live, and will legitimate it. And what
<PB N="289" REF="290">
a meritorious little cherub would it be, that &s;hould lay an obligation upon both parents before it was born, which nei|ther of them would be able to repay!&mdash;Could I be &s;ure it is &s;o, I &s;hould be out of all pain for her recovery: <HI>Pain,</HI> I &s;ay; &s;ince, were &s;he to <HI>die&mdash;(Die!</HI> abominable word! how I hate it!) I verily think I &s;hould be the mo&s;t mi&s;er|able man in the world.</P>
<P>As for the earne&s;tne&s;s &s;he expre&s;&s;es for death, &s;he has found the words ready to her hand in hone&s;t Job; el&s;e &s;he would not have delivered her&s;elf with &s;uch &s;trength and vehemence.</P>
<P>Her innate piety (as I have more than once ob&s;erved) will not permit her to &s;horten her own life, either by violence or neglect. She has a mind too noble for that; and would have done it before now, had &s;he de&s;igned any &s;uch thing: For, to do it, like the Roman matron, when the mi&s;chief is over, and it can &s;erve no end; and when the man, how|ever a Tarquin, as &s;ome may think him, in this action, is not a Tarquin in power, &s;o that no national point can be made of it; is what &s;he has too much good &s;en&s;e to think of.</P>
<P>Then, as I ob&s;erved in a like ca&s;e, a little while ago, the di&s;tre&s;s, when this was written, was &s;trong upon her; and &s;he &s;aw no end of it: But all was darkne&s;s and apprehen&s;ion before her. Moreover, has &s;he it not in her power to <HI>di&s;appoint,</HI> as much as &s;he has been <HI>di&s;ap|pointed?</HI> Revenge, Jack, has induced many a woman to cheri&s;h a life, which grief and de&s;pair would otherwi&s;e have put an end to.</P>
<P>And, after all, death is no &s;uch eligible thing, as Job in his <HI>calamities,</HI> makes it. And a death de&s;ired merely from worldly di&s;appointment &s;hews not a right mind, let me tell this lady, whatever &s;he may think of it <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Mr. Lovelace could not know, that the lady was <HI>&s;o</HI> thoroughly &s;en&s;ible of the &s;olidity of this doctrine, as &s;he really was: For, in letter lxix. to Mrs. Norton, (p. 247. of this volume) &s;he &s;ays,&mdash;

and I, Jack, altho' not afraid in the height of pa&s;&s;ion or re&s;entment to ru&s;h into tho&s;e dangers which might be followed by a &s;udden and violent death, whenever a point of honour calls upon us, would &s;hudder at his cool and deliberate approach in a lingering &s;ickne&s;s, which had de|bilitated the &s;pirits.</P>
<P>So we read of a French general, in the reign of Harry the IVth (I forget his name, if it were not Mare&s;chal Bi|ron) who, having faced with intrepidity the gha&s;tly varlet on an hundred occa&s;ions in the field, was the mo&s;t dejected of wretches, when, having forfeited his life for trea&s;on, he was led with all the cruel parade of preparation, and &s;urrounding guards, to the &s;caffold.</P>
<P>The poet &s;ays well:
<Q><L>'Tis not the Stoic le&s;&s;on, got by rote,</L>
<L>The pomp of words, and pedant di&s;&s;ertation,</L>
<L>That can &s;upport us in the hour of terror.</L>
<L>Books have taught cowards to talk nobly of it:</L>

<P>Very true: For then it is the old man in the fable, with his bundle of &s;ticks.</P>

<P>I Will now, my deare&s;t friend, write to you all my mind, without re&s;erve, on your re&s;olution not to have this vile&s;t of men. You gave me, in yours of Sunday the 23d, rea&s;ons &s;o worthy of the pure mind of my Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe, in &s;upport of this your re&s;olution, that nothing but &s;elf-love, le&s;t I &s;hould lo&s;e my ever-amiable friend, could have prevailed upon me to wi&s;h you to alter it.</P>
<P>Indeed, I thought it was impo&s;&s;ible there could be (how|ever de&s;irable) &s;o noble an in&s;tance given by any of our Sex, of a pa&s;&s;ion conquered, when there were &s;o many in|ducements to give way to it.

<P>But now, my dear, that I &s;ee you fixed in your noble re&s;olution; and that it is impo&s;&s;ible for your pure mind to

<P>For Heaven's &s;ake, then, for the world's &s;ake, for the honour of our &s;ex, and for <HI>my</HI> &s;ake, once more I be&s;eech you, try to overcome this &s;hock: And, if you <HI>can</HI> over|come it, I &s;hall then be as happy as I wi&s;h to be; for I cannot, indeed I cannot, think of parting with you, for many, many years to come.</P>
<P>The rea&s;ons you give for di&s;couraging my wi&s;hes to have you near us, are &s;o convincing, that I ought at pre|&s;ent to acquie&s;ce in them: But, my dear, when your mind is fully &s;ettled, as (now you are &s;o ab&s;olutely determined in it, with regard to this wretch) I hope it will &s;oon be, I &s;hall expect you with us, or near us: And then you &s;hall chalk out every path that I will &s;et my foot in; nor will I turn a&s;ide either to the right hand or to the left.</P>
<P>You wi&s;h I had not mediated for you to your friends. I wi&s;h &s;o too; becau&s;e it was ineffectual; becau&s;e it may give new ground for the malice of &s;ome of them to work upon; and becau&s;e you are angry with me for doing &s;o. But how, as I &s;aid in my former, could I &s;it down quietly, knowing how unea&s;y their implacablene&s;s mu&s;t make you? But I will tear my&s;elf from the &s;ubject&mdash;for I &s;ee I &s;hall
<PB N="294" REF="295">
be warm again&mdash;and di&s;plea&s;e you&mdash;And there is not one thing in the world, that I would do, however agreeable to my&s;elf, if I thought it would di&s;oblige you; nor any one that I would omit to do, if I knew it would give you plea&s;ure. And, indeed, my dear, half-&s;evere friend, I will try, if I cannot avoid the <HI>fault,</HI> as willingly as I would the <HI>rebuke.</HI></P>
<P>For this rea&s;on, I forbear &s;aying any-thing on &s;o nice a &s;ubject as your letter to your &s;i&s;ter. It <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be right, be|cau&s;e you think it &s;o&mdash;and, if it be taken as it ought, that will &s;hew you, that it <HI>is.</HI> But if it beget in&s;ults and re|vilings, as it is but too likely&mdash; I find you don't intend to let me know it.</P>
<P>You were always &s;o ready to accu&s;e your&s;elf for other peoples faults, and to &s;u&s;pect your own conduct, rather than the judgment of your relations, that I have often told you, I cannot imitate you in this. It is not a nece&s;&s;ary point of belief with me, that all people in <HI>years</HI> are <HI>there|fore</HI> wi&s;e; or that all <HI>young people</HI> are <HI>therefore</HI> ra&s;h and head&s;trong: It may be <HI>generally</HI> the ca&s;e, as far as I know: And po&s;&s;ibly it may be &s;o in the ca&s;e of <HI>my</HI> mother and <HI>her</HI> girl: But I will venture to &s;ay, that it has not yet ap|peared to be &s;o between the principals of Harlowe-Place, and their &s;econd daughter.</P>
<P>You are for excu&s;ing them before-hand for their expect|ed cruelty, as not knowing what you have &s;uffered, nor how ill you are: They have <HI>heard</HI> of the former, and are not &s;orry for it: Of the latter, they have been <HI>told,</HI> and <HI>I</HI> have mo&s;t rea&s;on to know how they have taken it&mdash;But I &s;hall be far from avoiding the <HI>fault,</HI> and as &s;urely &s;hall incur the <HI>rebuke,</HI> if I &s;ay any more upon this &s;ubject. I will therefore only add at pre&s;ent, That your rea&s;onings in their behalf &s;hew <HI>you</HI> to be all excellence; their returns to you, that <HI>they</HI> are all&mdash;Do, my dear, let me end with a little bit of &s;piteful ju&s;tice&mdash;But you won't, I know&mdash;So I have done, quite done, however reluctantly: Yet, if you think of the word I would have &s;aid, don't doubt the ju&s;tice of it, and fill up the blank with it.</P>
<P>You put me in hope, that, were I actually married, and Mr. Hickman to <HI>de&s;ire</HI> it, you would think of obliging me with a vi&s;it on the occa&s;ion; and that, perhaps, when
<PB N="295" REF="296">
with me, it would be difficult for you to remove far from me.</P>
<P>Lord, my dear, what a &s;tre&s;s do you &s;eem to lay upon Mr. Hickman's <HI>de&s;iring</HI> it! To be &s;ure he does, and would, of all things, de&s;ire to have you <HI>near</HI> us, and <HI>with</HI> us, if we might be &s;o favoured. Policy, as well as veneration for <HI>you,</HI> would undoubtedly make the man, if not a fool, <HI>de&s;ire</HI> this. But let me tell you, that if Mr. Hickman, after marriage, &s;hould pretend to di&s;pute with me my friend&s;hips, as I hope I am not quite a fool, I &s;hould let him know how far his own quiet was concerned in &s;uch an impertinence; e&s;pecially if they were &s;uch friend&s;hips as were contracted before I knew him.</P>
<P>I know I always differed from you on this &s;ubject; for you think more highly of a <HI>hu&s;band</HI>'s prerogative, than mo&s;t people do of the <HI>royal</HI> one.&mdash;The&s;e notions, my dear, from a per&s;on of your &s;en&s;e and judgment, are no-way advantageous to us; ina&s;much as they ju&s;tify that in&s;olent Sex in their a&s;&s;umptions; when hardly one out of ten of them, their opportunities con&s;idered, de&s;erve any prero|gative at all. Look thro' all the families we know; and we &s;hall not find one-third of them have half the &s;en&s;e of their wives.&mdash; And yet the&s;e are to be ve&s;ted with prero|gatives!&mdash;And a woman of twice their &s;en&s;e has nothing to do but hear, tremble, and obey&mdash;And for <HI>con&s;cience</HI>-&s;ake too, I warrant!</P>
<P>But Mr. Hickman and I may perhaps have a little di&s;|cour&s;e upon the&s;e &s;ort of &s;ubjects, before I &s;uffer him to talk of the day: And then I &s;hall let him know what he has to tru&s;t to; as he will me, if he be a &s;incere man, what he pretends to expect from me. But let me tell you, my dear, that it is more in <HI>your</HI> power, than perhaps you think it, to ha&s;ten the day &s;o much pre&s;&s;ed-for by my mother, as well as wi&s;h'd-for by you&mdash;For the very day that you can a&s;&s;ure me, that you are in a tolerable &s;tate of health, and have di&s;charged your Doctor and Apothecary, at their own motions, on that account&mdash;Some day in a month from that de&s;irable news, &s;hall be it&mdash;So, my dear, make ha&s;te and be well; and then this matter will be brought to ef|fect in a manner more agreeable to your Anne Howe, than it otherwi&s;e ever can.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="297">I &s;end this day, by a particular hand, to the Mi&s;&s;es Montague, your letter of ju&s;t reprobation of the greate&s;t profligate in the kingdom; and hope I &s;hall not have done ami&s;s, that I tran&s;cribe &s;ome of the paragraphs of your letter of the 23d, and &s;end them with it, as you at fir&s;t intended &s;hould be done.</P>
<P>You are, it &s;eems (and that too much for your health), employed in writing. I hope it is in penning down the particulars of your tragical &s;tory. And my mother has put me in mind to pre&s;s you to it, with a view, that one day, if it might be publi&s;hed under feigned names, it would be of as much u&s;e as honour to the Sex. My mo|ther &s;ays, &s;he cannot help admiring you for the propriety of your re&s;entment in your refu&s;al of the wretch; and &s;he would be extremely glad to have her advice of pen|ning your &s;ad &s;tory complied with. And then, &s;he &s;ays, your noble conduct throughout your trials and calamities will afford not only a &s;hining Example to your Sex; but, at the &s;ame time (tho&s;e calamities befalling SUCH a per&s;on) a fearful Warning to the incon&s;iderate young creatures of it.</P>
<P>On Monday we &s;hall &s;et out on our journey; and I hope to be back in a fortnight, and on my return will have one pull more with my mother for a London journey: And, if the <HI>pretence mu&s;t</HI> be the buying of cloaths, the <HI>principal motive</HI> will be that of &s;eeing once more my dear friend, <HI>while</HI> I can &s;ay, I have not finally given con&s;ent to the change of a vi&s;itor into a relation; and &s;o can call my&s;elf MY OWN, as well as</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Ladies,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have not been wanting to u&s;e all my intere&s;t with my beloved friend, to induce her to forgive and be recon|ciled to your kin&s;man (tho' he has &s;o ill de&s;erved it); and have even <HI>repeated</HI> my earne&s;t advice to her on this head. This repetition, and the waiting for her an&s;wer, having taken up time, have been the cau&s;e, that I could

<P>You will &s;ee, by the inclo&s;ed, her immoveable re&s;olu|tion, grounded on noble and high-&s;oul'd motives, which I cannot but <HI>regret</HI> and <HI>applaud</HI> at the &s;ame time: <HI>Applaud,</HI> for the ju&s;tice of her determination, which will confirm all your worthy hou&s;e in the opinion you had conceived of her unequalled merit; and <HI>regret,</HI> becau&s;e I have but too much rea&s;on to apprehend, as well by that, as by the report of a gentleman ju&s;t come from her, that &s;he is in &s;uch a declining way, as to her health, that her thoughts are very differently employed than on a continuance here.</P>
<P>The inclo&s;ed letter &s;he thought fit to &s;end to me un&s;ealed, that, after I had peru&s;ed it, I might forward it to you: And this is the rea&s;on it is &s;uper&s;cribed by my&s;elf, and &s;ealed with my &s;eal.

<SALUTE>My deare&s;t young Lady,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have the con&s;olation to tell you, that my &s;on is once again in an hopeful way, as to his health. He de&s;ires his duty to you. He is very low and weak. And &s;o am I. But this is the fir&s;t time that I have been able, for &s;e|veral days pa&s;t, to &s;it up to write, or I would not have been &s;o long &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Your letter to your &s;i&s;ter is received and an&s;wered. You have the an&s;wer by this time, I &s;uppo&s;e. I wi&s;h it may be to your &s;atisfaction: But am afraid it will not: For, by Betty Barnes, I find they were in a great ferment on receiving yours, and much divided whether it &s;hould be an&s;wered or not. They will not yet believe that you are &s;o ill, as, to my infinite concern, I find you are. What pa&s;&s;ed be|tween
<PB N="299" REF="300">
Mi&s;s Harlowe and Mi&s;s Howe, as I feared, has been an aggravation.</P>
<P>I &s;hewed Betty two or three pa&s;&s;ages in your letter to me; and &s;he &s;eemed moved, and &s;aid, She would report them favourably, and would procure me a vi&s;it from Mi&s;s Harlowe, if I would promi&s;e to &s;hew the &s;ame to <HI>her.</HI> But I have heard no more of that.</P>
<P>Methinks, I am &s;orry you refu&s;e the wicked man: But doubt not, neverthele&s;s, that your motives for doing &s;o, are righter, than my wi&s;hes that you would not. But as you would be re&s;olved, as I may &s;ay, on life, if you gave way to &s;uch a thought; and as I have &s;o much intere&s;t in it; I cannot forbear &s;hewing this regard to my&s;elf, as to a&s;k you, Cannot you, my dear young lady, get over your ju&s;t re&s;entments? &mdash; But I dare &s;ay no more on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>What a dreadful thing indeed was it for my deare&s;t tender young lady to be arre&s;ted in the &s;treets of London! &mdash;How does my heart go over again for you, what yours mu&s;t have &s;uffered at that time!&mdash;Yet this, to &s;uch a mind as yours, mu&s;t be light, compared to what you had &s;uf|fered before.</P>
<P>O my deare&s;t Mi&s;s Clary, how &s;hall we know what to pray for, when we pray for any thing, but that <HI>God's wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> may be done,</HI> and that we may be <HI>re&s;igned to it!</HI> &mdash; When at nine years old, and afterwards at eleven, you had a dan|gerous fever, how ince&s;&s;antly did we all grieve, and pray, and put up our vows to the throne of grace, for your re|covery! For all our lives were bound up in your life&mdash; Yet <HI>now,</HI> my dear, as it has proved (e&s;pecially if we are <HI>&s;oon</HI> to lo&s;e you) what a much more de&s;irable event, both for you, and for us, had we <HI>then</HI> lo&s;t you!</P>
<P>A &s;ad thing to &s;ay! But as it is in pure love to you that I &s;ay it, and in full conviction, that we are not always fit to be our own choo&s;ers, I hope it may be excu&s;eable; and the rather, as the &s;ame reflection will naturally lead both you and me to acquie&s;ce under the pre&s;ent di&s;pen&s;ation; &s;ince we are a&s;&s;ured, that nothing happens by chance; and that the greate&s;t good may, for aught we know, be produced from the heavie&s;t evils.</P>
<P>I am glad you are with &s;uch hone&s;t people; and that

you have all your effects re&s;tored&mdash;How dreadfully have you been u&s;ed, that one &s;hould be glad of &s;uch a poor piece of ju&s;tice as that?</P>
<P>Your talent at moving the pa&s;&s;ions is always hinted at; and this Betty of your &s;i&s;ter's never comes near me, that &s;he is not full of it. But, as you &s;ay, whom has it moved, that you <HI>wi&s;hed</HI> to move? Yet, were it not for this un|happy notion, I am &s;ure your mamma would relent.

<SALUTE>Honoured Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BEING forbidden, without leave, to &s;end you any-thing I might happen to receive from my beloved Mi&s;s Clary, and &s;o ill, that I cannot attend to <HI>ask</HI> your leave, I give you this trouble, to let you know, that I have received a letter from her; which, I think, I &s;hould hereafter be held inexcu&s;eable, as things may happen, if I did not de&s;ire permi&s;&s;ion to communicate it to you, and that as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Applications have been made to the dear young lady from Lord M. from the two ladi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his &s;i&s;ters, and from both his nieces, and from the wicked man him&s;elf, to for|give and marry him. This, in noble indignation for the u&s;age &s;he has received from him, &s;he has ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed. And perhaps, Madam, if you and the honoured family &s;hould be of opinion, that to comply with their wi&s;hes is <HI>now</HI> the propere&s;t mea&s;ure that <HI>can</HI> be taken, the circum|&s;tances of things may require your authority or advice, either to induce her to change her mind, or to confirm her in it.</P>
<P>I have rea&s;on to believe, that one motive for her refu&s;al, is her full conviction, that &s;he &s;hall not long be a trouble to
<PB N="301" REF="302">
any-body; and &s;o &s;he would not give a hu&s;band a right to interfere with her family, in relation to the e&s;tate her grand|father bequeathed to her. But of this, however, I have not the lea&s;t intimation from her. Nor would &s;he, I dare &s;ay, mention it, <HI>as</HI> a rea&s;on, having &s;till &s;tronger to refu&s;e him, from his vile treatment of her.</P>
<P>The letter I have received will &s;hew how truly penitent the dear creature is; and if I have your permi&s;&s;ion, I will &s;end it &s;ealed up, with a copy of mine, to which it is an an&s;wer. But as I re&s;olve upon this &s;tep without her know|lege (and indeed I do), I will not acquaint her with it, unle&s;s it be attended with de&s;irable effects: Becau&s;e, other|wi&s;e, be&s;ides making me incur her di&s;plea&s;ure, it might quite break her already half-broken heart.</P>

<P>WE all know your virtuous prudence, worthy woman; we all do. But your partiality to this your ra&s;h favourite is likewi&s;e known. And we are no le&s;s ac|quainted with the unhappy body's power of painting her di&s;tre&s;&s;es &s;o as to pierce a &s;tone.</P>
<P>Every-one is of opinion, that the dear naughty crea|ture is working about to be forgiven and received; and for this rea&s;on it is, that Betty has been forbidden (Not by me, you may be &s;ure!) to mention any more of her letters; for &s;he did &s;peak to my Bella of &s;ome moving pa&s;&s;ages you read to her.</P>
<P>This will convince you, that nothing will be heard in her favour: To what purpo&s;e then, &s;hould I mention any thing about her?&mdash;But you may be &s;ure that I <HI>will,</HI> if I can have but one &s;econd. However, that is not at all likely, until we &s;ee what the <HI>con&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">quences</HI> of her crime will be: And who can tell that?&mdash;She may&mdash;How can I &s;peak it, and my once darling daughter unmarried!&mdash;She may be with child!&mdash;This would perpetuate her &s;tain. Her bro|ther
<PB N="302" REF="303">
may come to &s;ome harm; which God forbid!&mdash;One child's ruin, I hope, will not be followed by another's murder!</P>
<P>As to her grief, and her pre&s;ent mi&s;ery, whatever it be, &s;he mu&s;t bear with it; and it mu&s;t be &s;hort of what I hourly bear for her! Indeed I am afraid nothing but her being at the la&s;t extremity of all will make her father, and her uncles, and her other friends, forgive her.</P>
<P>The ea&s;y pardon perver&s;e children meet with, when they have done the ra&s;he&s;t and mo&s;t rebellious thing they can do, is the rea&s;on <HI>(as is pleaded to us every day),</HI> that &s;o <HI>many</HI> follow their example. They depend upon the in|dulgent weakne&s;s of their parents tempers, and, in <HI>that</HI> dependence, harden their own hearts: And a little humi|liation, when they have brought them&s;elves into the fore|told mi&s;ery, is to be a &s;ufficient atonement for the greate&s;t perver&s;ene&s;s.</P>
<P>But for &s;uch a child as this <HI>(I mention what others hourly &s;ay, but what I mu&s;t &s;orrowfully &s;ub&s;cribe to)</HI> to lay plots and &s;tratagems to deceive her parents, as well as her&s;elf; and to run away with a libertine; Can there be any atone|ment for her crime? And is &s;he not an&s;werable to God, to us, to you, and to all the world who knew her, for the abu&s;e of &s;uch talents as <HI>&s;he</HI> has abu&s;ed?</P>
<P>You &s;ay her heart is half-broken: Is it to be wondered at? Was not her &s;in committed equally again&s;t warning, and the light of her own knowlege?</P>
<P>That <HI>he</HI> would now marry her, or that <HI>&s;he</HI> would refu&s;e him, if &s;he believed him in earne&s;t, as &s;he has circum&s;tanced her&s;elf, is not at all probable; and were <HI>I</HI> inclined to be|lieve it, <HI>no-body el&s;e</HI> here would. He values not his rela|tions; and would deceive them as &s;oon as any others: His aver&s;ion to marriage he has always openly declared; and &s;till occa&s;ionally declares it. But if he be now in earne&s;t, which every one who knows him mu&s;t doubt; Which do you think (hating us too, as he profe&s;&s;es to hate and de&s;pi&s;e us all) would be &s;oone&s;t to be cho&s;en here, To hear of her death, or of her marriage with &s;uch a vile man?</P>
<P>To all of us, yet, I cannot &s;ay! For Oh! my good Mrs. Norton, you know what a mother's tenderne&s;s for the
<PB N="303" REF="304">
child of her heart would make her choo&s;e, notwith&s;tand|ing all that child's faults, rather than lo&s;e her for ever!</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t &s;ail with the tide; my own judgment al&s;o joining with it, or I &s;hould make the unhappine&s;s of the more worthy &s;till greater (my dear Mr. Harlowe's parti|cularly); which is already more than enough to make them unhappy for the remainder of their days. This I know; If I were to oppo&s;e the re&s;t, our &s;on would fly out to find this libertine; and who could tell what would be the i&s;&s;ue of that, with &s;uch a man of violence and blood, as that Lovelace is known to be?</P>
<P>All I can expect to prevail for her, is, that in a week, or &s;o, Mr. Brand may be &s;ent up to inquire privately about her pre&s;ent &s;tate, and way of life, and to &s;ee &s;he is not altogether de&s;titute: For nothing &s;he writes her&s;elf will be regarded.</P>
<P>Her father indeed has, at her earne&s;t reque&s;t, withdrawn the cur&s;e, which, in a pa&s;&s;ion, he laid upon her, at her fir&s;t wicked flight from us. But Mi&s;s Howe [It is a &s;ad thing, Mrs. Norton, to &s;uffer &s;o many ways at once!] had made matters &s;o difficult by her undue liberties with us all, as well by &s;peech in all companies, as by letters written to my Bella, that we could hardly prevail upon him to hear her letter read.</P>
<P>The&s;e liberties of Mi&s;s Howe with us; the general cry again&s;t us abroad, where-ever we are &s;poken of; and the <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> and not &s;eldom, <HI>audible</HI> di&s;re&s;pectfulne&s;s, which high and low treat us with to our faces, as we go to and from church, and even <HI>at</HI> church (for no-where el&s;e have we the heart to go), as if none of us had been regarded but upon her account; and as if &s;he were innocent, we all in fault; are con&s;tant aggravations, you mu&s;t needs think, to the whole family.</P>
<P>She has made my lot heavy, I am &s;ure, that was far from being light before!&mdash;I am injoined (to tell you truth) not to receive any thing of hers, from any hand, without leave. Should I therefore gratify my yearnings after her, &s;o far as to receive privately the letter you mention, what would the ca&s;e be, but to torment my&s;elf, without being able to do her good?&mdash;And were it to be known&mdash;Mr. Harlowe is <HI>&s;o</HI> pa&s;&s;ionate&mdash;And &s;hould it throw his gout
<PB N="304" REF="305">
into his &s;tomach, as her ra&s;h flight did&mdash;Indeed, indeed, I am very unhappy!&mdash;For Oh, my good woman, &s;he is my child still!&mdash;But unle&s;s it were more in my power&mdash; Yet do I long to &s;ee the letter&mdash;You &s;ay it tells of her pre|&s;ent way and circum&s;tances.&mdash;The poor child, who ought to be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of thou&s;ands!&mdash;And <HI>will!</HI>&mdash;For her father will be a faithful &s;teward for her.&mdash;But it mu&s;t be in his own way, and at his own time.</P>
<P>And is &s;he <HI>really</HI> ill?&mdash;&s;o <HI>very</HI> ill? &mdash; But &s;he <HI>ought</HI> to &s;orrow.&mdash;She has given a double mea&s;ure of it.</P>
<P>But does &s;he <HI>really</HI> believe &s;he &s;hall not <HI>long</HI> trouble us? &mdash;But Oh, my Norton!&mdash;She mu&s;t, &s;he <HI>will</HI> long trouble us&mdash;For can &s;he think her death, if we &s;hould be deprived of her, will put an end to our afflictions? &mdash; Can it be thought, that the fall of &s;uch a child will not be regretted by us to the la&s;t hour of our lives?</P>
<P>But, in the letter you have, does &s;he, without <HI>re&s;erve,</HI> expre&s;s her contrition? Has &s;he in it no reflecting hints? Does &s;he not aim at extenuations?&mdash;If I <HI>were</HI> to &s;ee it, will it not &s;hock me &s;o much, that my <HI>apparent</HI> grief may expo&s;e me to har&s;hne&s;&s;es?&mdash;Can it be contrived&mdash;</P>
<P>But to what purpo&s;e?&mdash;Don't &s;end it&mdash;I charge you don't&mdash;I dare not &s;ee it &mdash;</P>
<P>Yet&mdash;</P>
<P>But, alas!&mdash;</P>
<P>O forgive the di&s;tracted-thoughted mother! You <HI>can.</HI> &mdash;You know how to allow for all this. &mdash; So I will let it go.&mdash;I will not write over again this part of my letter.</P>
<P>But I choo&s;e not to know more of her, than is commu|nicated to us all&mdash;No more than I dare <HI>own</HI> I have &s;een&mdash; And what &s;ome of them may rather communicate <HI>to</HI> me, than receive <HI>from</HI> me: And this for the &s;ake of my out|ward quiet: Altho' my inward peace &s;uffers more and more by the compelled re&s;erve.</P>
<P>I was forced to break off. But I will now try to con|clude my long letter.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry you are ill. But if you were well, I could not, for your own &s;ake, wi&s;h you to go up, as Betty tells us you long to do. If you <HI>went,</HI> nothing would be minded that came from you. As they already think you too par|tial

in her favour, your going up would confirm it, and do your&s;elf prejudice, and her no good. And as every-body values you here, I advi&s;e you not to intere&s;t your&s;elf too warmly in her favour, e&s;pecially before my Bella's Betty, till I can let you know a <HI>proper</HI> time. Yet to forbid you to love the dear naughty creature, who can? O my Norton! you <HI>mu&s;t</HI> love her!&mdash;And &s;o mu&s;t I!</P>
<P>I &s;end you five guineas, to help you in your pre&s;ent ill|ne&s;s, and your &s;on's; for it mu&s;t have lain heavy upon you. What a &s;ad, &s;ad thing, my dear good woman, that all <HI>your</HI> pains, and all <HI>my</HI> pains, for eighteen or nineteen years together, have, in &s;o few months, been rendered thus deplorably vain! Yet I mu&s;t be always your friend, and pity you, for the very rea&s;on that I my&s;elf de&s;erve every one's pity.</P>
<P>Perhaps I may find an opportunity to pay you a vi&s;it, as in your illne&s;s, and then may weep over the letter you mention, with you. But, for the future, write nothing to me about the poor girl, that you think may not be com|municated to us all.</P>
<P>And I charge you, as you value my friend&s;hip, as you wi&s;h my peace, not to &s;ay any-thing of a letter you have from me, either to the naughty-one, or to any-body el&s;e. I was &s;ome little relief (the occa&s;ion given) to write to you, who mu&s;t, in &s;o particular a manner, &s;hare my af|fliction.

<P>I Congratulate you, my dear Mrs. Norton, with all my heart, on your &s;on's recovery; which I pray to God, with your own health, to perfect.</P>
<P>I write in &s;ome hurry, being apprehen&s;ive of the con|&s;equence of the hints you give of &s;ome method you pro|po&s;e
<PB N="306" REF="307">
to try in my favour (With my relations, I pre&s;ume you mean): But you will not tell me what, you &s;ay, if it prove un&s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>Now I mu&s;t beg of you, that you will not take any &s;tep in my favour, with which you do not fir&s;t acquaint me.</P>
<P>I have but one reque&s;t to make to them, be&s;ides what is contained in my letter to my &s;i&s;ter; and I would not, me|thinks, for their own future peace of mind's &s;ake, that they &s;hould be teazed &s;o, by your well-meant kindne&s;s, and Mi&s;s Howe's, as to be put upon denying me that. And why &s;hould more be a&s;ked for me than I can partake of? More than is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for my own peace?</P>
<P>You &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hould have my &s;i&s;ter's an&s;wer to my letter, by the time yours reached my hand. I have it; and a &s;evere one, a very &s;evere one, it is. Yet, con&s;idering my fault in their eyes, and the provocations I am to &s;uppo&s;e they &s;o newly had from my dear Mi&s;s Howe, I am to look upon it as a favour, that it was an&s;wered at all. I will &s;end you a copy of it &s;oon; as al&s;o of mine, to which it is an an&s;wer.</P>
<P>I have rea&s;on to be very thankful, that my father has withdrawn that heavy malediction, which affected me &s;o much&mdash;A parent's cur&s;e, my dear Mrs. Norton, what child could die in peace under a parent's cur&s;e; &s;o literally fulfilled too, as this has been, in what relates to this life!</P>
<P>My heart is too full to touch upon the particulars of my &s;i&s;ter's letter. &mdash; I can make but <HI>one</HI> atonement for my fault. May <HI>that</HI> be accepted! And may it &s;oon be for|gotten, by <HI>every</HI> dear relation, that there was &s;uch an un|happy daughter, &s;i&s;ter, or niece, as Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe!</P>
<P>My cou&s;in Morden was one of tho&s;e, who was &s;o earned in prayers for my recovery, at nine and eleven years of age, as you mention. My &s;i&s;ter thinks he will be one of tho&s;e, who will wi&s;h I never had a being. But pray, when he does come, let me hear of it with the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>You think, that were it not for that unhappy notion of my moving talent, my mamma would relent. What would I give to &s;ee her once more, and, altho' unknown to her, to ki&s;s but the hem of her garment!</P>
<P>Could I have thought, that the la&s;t time I &s;aw her would <HI>have been the la&s;t,</HI> with what difficulty &s;hould I have been

<P>But I can write nothing, but what mu&s;t give you trouble. I will therefore, after repeating my de&s;ire, that you will not intercede for me, but with my previous con&s;ent, con|clude with the a&s;&s;urance, that I am, and ever will be,</P>

<SALUTE>O my unhappy lo&s;t Sister!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHAT a mi&s;erable hand have you made of your romantic and giddy expedition! I pity you at my heart!</P>
<P>You may <HI>well</HI> grieve and repent!&mdash;Lovelace has left you!&mdash;In what way or circum&s;tances, you know be&s;t.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h your conduct had made your ca&s;e more pitiable. But 'tis your own &s;eeking!</P>
<P>God help you! &mdash; For you have not a friend will look upon you!&mdash;Poor, wicked, undone creature!&mdash;Fallen, as you are, again&s;t warning, again&s;t expo&s;tulation, again&s;t duty!</P>
<P>But it &s;ignifies nothing to reproach you. I weep over you!</P>
<P>My poor mamma!&mdash;Your ra&s;hne&s;s and folly have made <HI>her</HI> more mi&s;erable than <HI>you</HI> can be! Yet &s;he has be&s;ought my papa to grant your reque&s;t.</P>
<P>My uncles joined with her; for they thought there was a little more mode&s;ty in your letter, than in tho&s;e of your pert advocate: And he is plea&s;ed to give me leave to write; but only the&s;e words for <HI>him,</HI> and no more:
<Q>That he withdraws the cur&s;e he laid upon you, at the fir&s;t hearing of your wicked flight, &s;o far as it is in his

power to do it; and hopes that your pre&s;ent puni&s;hment may be all you will meet with. For the re&s;t, He will never own you, nor forgive you; and grieves he has &s;uch a daughter in the world.</Q></P>
<P>All this, and more, you have de&s;erved from him, and from all of <HI>Us:</HI> But what have you done to this aban|doned libertine, to de&s;erve what you have met with at <HI>his</HI> hands?&mdash;I fear, I fear, &s;i&s;ter!&mdash;But no more!&mdash;A ble&s;&s;ed four months work have you made of it!</P>
<P>My brother is now at Edinburgh, &s;ent thither by my father (tho' he knows not this to be the motive), that he may not meet this triumphant deluder.</P>
<P>We are told he would be glad to marry you: But why, then, did he abandon you? He had kept you, till he was tired of you, no que&s;tion; and it is not likely he would wi&s;h to have you, but upon the terms you have already without all doubt been <HI>his.</HI></P>
<P>You ought to advi&s;e your friend Mi&s;s Howe to concern her&s;elf le&s;s in your matters, than &s;he does, except &s;he could do it with more decency. She has written three letters to me: Very in&s;olent ones. Your favourer, poor Mrs. Nor|ton, thinks you know nothing of the pert creature's write|ing. I hope you don't. But then the more impertinent the writer. But, believing the fond woman, I &s;at down the more readily to an&s;wer your letter, and write with le&s;s &s;everity, than otherwi&s;e I &s;hould have done, if I had an|&s;wered it at all.</P>
<P>Monday la&s;t was your Birth-day. Think, poor ingrate|ful wretch, as you are! how we all u&s;ed to keep it; and you will not wonder to be told, that we ran away from one another that day.

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Sunday, July</HI> 30.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have given me great plea&s;ure, my deare&s;t friend, by your approbation of my rea&s;onings, and of my re&s;olution founded upon them, never to have Mr. Love|lace. This approbation is &s;o <HI>right</HI> a thing, give me leave to &s;ay, from the nature of the ca&s;e, and from the &s;trict honour and true dignity of mind, which I always admired in my Anna Howe, that I could hardly tell to what, but to my evil de&s;tiny, that of late would not let me plea&s;e any|body, to attribute the advice you gave me to the contrary.</P>
<P>But let not the ill &s;tate of my health, and what that may naturally tend to, &s;adden you. I have told you, that I will not run away from life, nor avoid the means that may con|tinue it, if God &s;ee fit: And if he do <HI>not,</HI> who &s;hall repine at his will?</P>
<P>If it &s;hall be found, that I have not acted unworthy of your love, and of my own character, in my greater trials, that will be a happine&s;s to both on reflection.</P>
<P>The &s;hock which you &s;o earne&s;tly advi&s;e me to try to get over, was a &s;hock, the greate&s;t that I could receive. But, my dear, as it was not incurred by my <HI>fault,</HI> I hope I am already got above it. I hope I am!</P>
<P>I am more grieved (at times however) for <HI>others,</HI> than for <HI>my&s;elf.</HI> And &s;o I <HI>ought.</HI> For as to <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> I cannot but reflect, that I have had an e&s;cape, rather than a lo&s;s, in mi&s;&s;ing Mr. Lovelace for a hu&s;band: Even had he <HI>not</HI> committed the vile&s;t of all outrages.</P>
<P>Let any one, who knows my &s;tory, collect his character from his behaviour to <HI>me, before</HI> that outrage; and then judge, whether it was in the lea&s;t probable for &s;uch a man to make me happy. But to collect his character from his principles, with regard to the <HI>Sex in general,</HI> and from his enterprizes upon many of them, and to con&s;ider the cru|elty of his nature, and the &s;portivene&s;s of his invention, together with the high opinion he has of him&s;elf, it will not be doubted, that a wife of his mu&s;t have been mi&s;era|ble; and more mi&s;erable if &s;he loved him, than if &s;he could have been indifferent to him.</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="311">A <HI>twelvemonth</HI> might, very probably, have put a pe|riod to my life; &s;ituated as I was with my friends; per&s;e|cuted and hara&s;&s;ed as I had been by my brother and &s;i&s;ter; and my very heart torn in pieces by the <HI>wilful,</HI> and, as it is now apparent, <HI>premeditated</HI> &s;u&s;pen&s;es of the man, who&s;e gratitude I wi&s;hed to engage, and who&s;e protection I was the more intitled to expect, as he had robbed me of every other, and, hating my own family, had reduced me to an ab&s;olute dependence upon him&s;elf. This once, as I thought, all his view; and uncomfortable enough for me, if it had been all.</P>
<P>Can it be thought, my dear, that my heart was not af|fected, happy as I was before I knew Mr. Lovelace, by &s;uch an unhappy change in my circum&s;tances?&mdash;Nor, perhaps, was the wicked violence <HI>wanting</HI> to have cut &s;hort, tho' not &s;o <HI>very</HI> &s;hort perhaps, a life that he has &s;ported with.</P>
<P>Had I been his but a <HI>month,</HI> he mu&s;t have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the e&s;tate on which my relations had &s;et their hearts; the more to their regret, as they hated <HI>him,</HI> as much as he hated <HI>them.</HI></P>
<P>Have I not rea&s;on, the&s;e things con&s;idered, to think my&s;elf happier without Mr. Lovelace, than with him?&mdash; My will too unviolated; and very little, nay, not any-thing, as to him, to reproach my&s;elf with?</P>
<P>But with my <HI>relations</HI> it is <HI>otherwi&s;e.</HI> They indeed de|&s;erve to be pitied. They are, and no doubt will long be, unhappy.</P>
<P>To judge of their re&s;entments, and of their conduct, we mu&s;t put our&s;elves in their &s;ituation:&mdash;And while <HI>they</HI> think me more in fault than them&s;elves (whether my favourers are of their opinion, or not) and have a right to judge for them&s;elves, they ought to have great allowances made for them; my parents e&s;pecially. They &s;tand at lea&s;t <HI>&s;elf</HI>-acquitted (that cannot I); and the rather, as they can re|collect, to their pain, their pa&s;t indulgencies to me, and their unque&s;tionable love.</P>
<P>Your partiality for the friend you &s;o much value, will not ea&s;ily let you come into this way of thinking. But only, my dear, be plea&s;ed to con&s;ider the matter in the following light.</P>
<P>Here was my MOTHER, one of the mo&s;t prudent per|&s;ons
<PB N="311" REF="312">
of her Sex, married into a family, not perhaps &s;o happily tempered as her&s;elf; but every one of which &s;he had the addre&s;s, for a great while, ab&s;olutely to govern as &s;he plea&s;ed by her directing wi&s;dom, at the &s;ame time that they knew not but her pre&s;criptions were the dictates of their own hearts; &s;uch a &s;weet art had &s;he of conquering by &s;eeming to yield. Think, my dear, what mu&s;t be the pride and the plea&s;ure of &s;uch a mother, that in my bro|ther &s;he could give a <HI>&s;on</HI> to the family &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed with her preferable love, not unworthy of their wi&s;hes; a <HI>daughter,</HI> in my <HI>&s;i&s;ter,</HI> of whom &s;he had no rea&s;on to be a&s;hamed; and in <HI>me,</HI> a <HI>&s;econd</HI> daughter, whom every-body complimented (&s;uch was their partial favour to me) as being the &s;till more immediate likene&s;s of her&s;elf? How, &s;elf-plea&s;ed, could &s;he &s;mile round upon a family &s;he had &s;o ble&s;&s;ed! What compliments were paid her upon the example &s;he had given us, which were followed with &s;uch hopeful effects! With what a noble confidence could &s;he look upon her dear Mr. Harlowe, as a per&s;on made happy by her; and be delighted to think, that nothing but purity &s;treamed from a fountain &s;o pure!</P>
<P>Now, my dear, rever&s;e, as I daily do, this charming pro&s;pect. See my dear <HI>mamma,</HI> &s;orrowing in her clo&s;et; endeavouring to &s;uppre&s;s her &s;orrow at her table, and in tho&s;e retirements where &s;orrow was before a &s;tranger: Hanging down her pen&s;ive head: Smiles no more beaming over her benign a&s;pect: Her virtue made to &s;uffer for faults &s;he could not be guilty of: Her patience continually tried (becau&s;e &s;he has more of it than any other) with repeti|tions of faults &s;he is as much wounded by, as tho&s;e can be from whom &s;he &s;o often hears of them: Taking to her&s;elf, as the fountain-head, a taint which only had in|fected one of the under-currents: Afraid to open her lips (were &s;he willing) in my favour, le&s;t it &s;hould be thought &s;he has any byas in her own mind to failings that never otherwi&s;e could have been &s;u&s;pected in her: Robbed of that con&s;cious merit, which the mother of hopeful chil|dren may glory in: Every one who vi&s;its her, or is vi&s;ited by her, by dumb &s;hew, and looks that mean more than words can expre&s;s, condoling where they u&s;ed to con|gratulate: The affected &s;ilence wounding: The com|pa&s;&s;ionating

look reminding: The half-&s;uppre&s;&s;ed &s;igh in <HI>them,</HI> calling up deeper &s;ighs from <HI>her;</HI> and their averted eyes, endeavouring to re&s;train the ri&s;ing tear, provoking tears from <HI>her,</HI> that will not be re&s;trained.</P>
<P>When I con&s;ider the&s;e things, and, added to the&s;e, the pangs that tear in pieces my FATHER's &s;tronger heart, be|cau&s;e it cannot relieve it&s;elf by tho&s;e tears which carry the torturing grief to the eyes of &s;ofter &s;pirits: The overboil|ing tumults of my impatient and uncontroulable BROTHER, piqued to the heart of his honour, in the fall of a &s;i&s;ter, in whom he once gloried: The pride of an ELDER SISTER, who had given unwilling way to the honours paid over her head to one born after her: And, la&s;tly, the di&s;honour I have brought upon TWO UNCLES, who each contended which &s;hould mo&s;t favour their then happy niece: When, I &s;ay, I reflect upon my fault in the&s;e &s;trong, yet ju&s;t lights, what room can there be to cen&s;ure any-body but my unhappy &s;elf? And how much rea&s;on have I to &s;ay, <HI>If I ju&s;tify my&s;elf, mine own heart &s;hall condemn me: If I &s;ay, I am per|fect, it &s;hall al&s;o prove me perver&s;e?</HI></P>
<P>Here permit me to lay down my pen for a few moments.</P>
<P>You are very obliging to me, <HI>intentionally,</HI> I know, when you tell me, It is in my power to ha&s;ten the day of Mr. Hickman's happine&s;s. But yet, give me leave to &s;ay, that I admire this kind a&s;&s;urance le&s;s than any other para|graph of your letter.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, you know it is <HI>not</HI> in my power to &s;ay <HI>when</HI> I can di&s;mi&s;s my phy&s;ician; and you &s;hould not put the celebration of a marriage <HI>intended</HI> by <HI>your&s;elf,</HI> and &s;o <HI>de&s;irable</HI> to your <HI>mother,</HI> upon &s;o precarious an i&s;&s;ue. Nor will I accept of a compliment, which mu&s;t mean a &s;light to <HI>her.</HI></P>
<P>If any-thing could give me a reli&s;h for life, after what I have &s;uffered, it would be the hopes of the continuance of the more than &s;i&s;terly love, which has, for years, unin|terruptedly bound us together as one mind.&mdash;And why, my dear, &s;hould you defer giving (by a tie &s;till &s;tronger) a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">her friend to one, who has &s;o few?</P>
<P>I am glad you have &s;ent my letter to Mi&s;s Montague. I hope I &s;hall hear no more of this unhappy man.</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="314">I had begun the particulars of my tragical &s;tory: But it is &s;o painful a ta&s;k, and I have &s;o many more important things to do, and, as I apprehend, &s;o little time to do them in, that, could I avoid it, I would go no farther in it.</P>
<P>Then, to this hour, I know not by what means &s;everal of his machinations to ruin me were brought about; &s;o that &s;ome material parts of my &s;ad &s;tory mu&s;t be defective, if I were to &s;it down to write it. But I have been think|ing of a way that will an&s;wer the end wi&s;hed for by your mother and you full as well; perhaps better.</P>
<P>Mr. Lovelace, it &s;eems, has communicated to his friend Mr. Belford all that has pa&s;&s;ed between him&s;elf and me, as he went on. Mr. Belford has not been able to deny it. So that (as we may ob&s;erve by the way) a poor young creature, who&s;e indi&s;cretion has given a libertine power over her, has a rea&s;on, <HI>&s;he little thinks of,</HI> to regret her folly; &s;ince the&s;e wretches, who have no more honour in one point than in another, &s;cruple not to make her weak|ne&s;s a part of their triumph to their brother libertines.</P>
<P>I have nothing to apprehend of this &s;ort, if I have the ju&s;tice done me in his letters, which Mr. Belford a&s;&s;ures me that I have: And therefore the particulars of my &s;tory, and the ba&s;e arts of this vile man, will, I think, be be&s;t collected from tho&s;e very letters of his (if Mr. Belford can be prevailed upon to communicate them); to which I dare appeal with the &s;ame truth and fervor as he did, who &s;ays, &mdash;<HI>O that one would hear me! and that mine adver&s;ary had written a book!&mdash;Surely, I would take it upon my &s;houlders, and bind it to me as a crown! For I covered not my tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bo&s;om.</HI></P>
<P>There is one way, which may be fallen upon to induce Mr. Belford to communicate the&s;e letters; &s;ince he &s;eems to have (and declares he always had) a &s;incere abhorrence of his friend's ba&s;ene&s;s to me: But that, you'll &s;ay, when you hear it, is a &s;trange one. Neverthele&s;s, I am very earne&s;t upon it, at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>It is no other than this:</P>
<P>I think to make Mr. Belford the Executor of my la&s;t will (Don't be &s;urpri&s;ed!): And with this view I permit his vi&s;its with the le&s;s &s;cruple: And every time I &s;ee him, from his concern for me, am more and more inclined to
<PB N="314" REF="315">
do &s;o. If I hold in the &s;ame mind, and if he accept the tru&s;t, and will communicate the materials in his power, tho&s;e, joined with what you can furni&s;h, will an&s;wer the whole end.</P>
<P>I know you will &s;tart at my notion of &s;uch an Executor: But pray, my dear, con&s;ider, in my pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, what I can do better, as I am impowered to make a will, and have con&s;iderable matters in my own di&s;po&s;al.</P>
<P>Your mother, I am &s;ure, would not con&s;ent that <HI>you</HI> &s;hould take this office upon you. It might &s;ubject <HI>Mr. Hickman</HI> to the in&s;ults of that violent man. <HI>Mrs. Norton</HI> cannot, for &s;everal rea&s;ons re&s;pecting her&s;elf. My <HI>Brother</HI> looks upon what I ought to have, as his right: My <HI>uncle Harlowe</HI> is already my tru&s;tee, with my cou&s;in Morden, for the e&s;tate my grandfather left me: But you &s;ee I could not get from my own family the few pieces I left behind me at Harlowe-Place; and my <HI>uncle Antony</HI> once threat|ened to have my grandfather's will controverted. My <HI>Father!</HI>&mdash;To be &s;ure, my dear, I could not expect that my <HI>Father</HI> would do all I wi&s;h &s;hould be done: And a <HI>will</HI> to be executed by a father for a daughter (parts of it, perhaps, ab&s;olutely again&s;t his own judgment) carries &s;omewhat daring and pre&s;criptive in the very <HI>word.</HI></P>
<P>If, indeed, my <HI>cou&s;in Morden</HI> were to come in time, and would undertake this tru&s;t&mdash;But even <HI>him</HI> it might &s;ubject to hazards; and the more, as he is a man of great &s;pirit; and as the other man (of <HI>as</HI> great) looks upon me (unpro|tected as I have long been) as his property.</P>
<P>Now Mr. Belford knows, as I have already mentioned, every-thing that has pa&s;&s;ed. He is a man of &s;pirit, and, it &s;eems, as fearle&s;s as the other, with more humane qualities. You don't know, my dear, what in&s;tances of &s;incere hu|manity this Mr. Belford has &s;hewn, not only on occa&s;ion of the cruel arre&s;t, but on &s;everal occa&s;ions &s;ince. And Mrs. Lovick has taken pains to inquire after his general character; and hears a very good one of him, for ju&s;tice and genero&s;ity in all his concerns of <HI>Meum</HI> and <HI>Tuum,</HI> as they are called: He has a knowlege of law-matters; and has two executor&s;hips upon him at this time, in the di&s;|charge of which his honour is unque&s;tioned.</P>
<P>All the&s;e rea&s;ons have already in a manner determined
<PB N="315" REF="316">
me to a&s;k this favour of him; altho' it will have an odd &s;ound with it, to make an intimate friend of Mr. Love|lace my Executor.</P>
<P>This is certain: My brother will be more acquie&s;cent a great deal in &s;uch a ca&s;e with the articles of my will, as he will &s;ee that it will be to no purpo&s;e to controvert &s;ome of them, which el&s;e, I dare &s;ay, he would contro|vert, or per&s;uade my other friends to do &s;o. And who would involve an Executor in a Law-&s;uit, if they could help it? Which would be the ca&s;e, if any-body were left, whom my brother could hope to awe or controul; &s;ince my father (who is governed by him) has po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all: Nor would I wi&s;h, you may believe, to have effects torn out of my father's hands: While Mr. Belford, who is a man of fortune (and a good oeconomi&s;t in his own affairs), would have no intere&s;t but to do ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Then he exceedingly pre&s;&s;es for &s;ome occa&s;ion to &s;hew his readine&s;s to &s;erve me: And he would be able to manage his violent friend, over whom he has more influence than any other per&s;on.</P>
<P>But, after all, I know not, if it were not more eligible by far, that my &s;tory &s;hould be forgotten as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; and my&s;elf too. And of this I &s;hall have the le&s;s doubt, if the character of my parents cannot be guarded (You will forgive me, my dear) from the unqualified bitterne&s;s, which, from your affectionate zeal for me, has &s;ometimes mingled with your ink. A point that ought, and (I in&s;i&s;t upon it) mu&s;t be well con&s;idered of, if any-thing be done which your mother and you are de&s;irous &s;hould be done.</P>
<P>My father has been &s;o good as to take off from me the heavy malediction he laid me under. I mu&s;t be now &s;oli|citous for a la&s;t ble&s;&s;ing; and that is all I &s;hall pre&s;ume to a&s;k. My &s;i&s;ter's letter, communicating this grace, is a &s;e|vere one. But as &s;he writes to me as <HI>from every-body,</HI> how could I expect it to be otherwi&s;e?</P>
<P>If you &s;et out to-morrow, this letter cannot reach you till you get to your aunt Harman's. I &s;hall therefore di|rect it thither, as Mr. Hickman in&s;tructed me.</P>
<P>I hope you will have met with no inconveniencies in your little journey and voyage; and that you will have found in good health all whom you wi&s;h to &s;ee well.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="317">Let me recommend to you, my dear, that, if your friends and relations in the little I&s;land join their &s;olicitations with your mother's commands, to have your nuptials celebrated before you leave them, you do not refu&s;e to oblige them.

<P>I Repine not, my dear &s;i&s;ter, at the &s;everity you have been plea&s;ed to expre&s;s in the letter you favoured me with; becau&s;e that &s;everity was accompanied with the grace I had petitioned for: And becau&s;e the reproaches of my own heart are &s;tronger than any other per&s;on's re|proaches can be; altho' I am not half &s;o culpable as I am imagined to be; as would be allowed, if all the circum|&s;tances of my unhappy &s;tory were known; and which I &s;hall be ready to communicate to Mrs. Norton, if &s;he be commi&s;&s;ioned to inquire into them; or to you, my &s;i&s;ter, if you can have patience to hear them.</P>
<P>I remembred with a bleeding heart what day the 24th of July was. I began with the eve of it; and I pa&s;&s;ed the day it&s;elf&mdash;as it was fit I &s;hould pa&s;s it. Nor have I any comfort to give to my dear and ever-honoured father and mother, and to you, my Bella, but This&mdash;That, as it was the fir&s;t <HI>unhappy</HI> anniver&s;ary of my birth, in all pro|bability, it will be the <HI>la&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Believe me, my dear &s;i&s;ter, I &s;ay not this, merely to move compa&s;&s;ion; but from the <HI>be&s;t</HI> grounds: And as I think it of the highe&s;t importance to my peace of mind, to obtain one further favour, I would choo&s;e to owe to your interce&s;&s;ion, as my &s;i&s;ter, the leave I beg, to addre&s;s half a dozen lines, with the hope of having them an&s;wered as I wi&s;h, to either or to both my honoured parents, to beg their <HI>la&s;t ble&s;&s;ing.</HI></P>

<SALUTE>My deare&s;t young Lady,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Mu&s;t indeed own, that I took the liberty to write to your mamma, offering to inclo&s;e to her, if &s;he gave me leave, yours of the 24th: By which I thought &s;he would &s;ee what was the &s;tate of your mind; what the na|ture of your la&s;t troubles was, from the wicked arre&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> what the people are where you lodge; what propo&s;als were made you from Lord M.'s family; al&s;o your &s;incere peni|tence; and how much Mi&s;s Howe's writing to them, in the terms &s;he wrote in, di&s;turbed you&mdash; But, as you have taken the matter into your own hands, and forbid me, in your la&s;t, to act in this nice affair unknown to you, I am glad the letter was <HI>not required of me:</HI> And indeed it may be better that the matter lie wholly between you and them; &s;ince my affection for you is thought to proceed from par|tiality.</P>
<P>They would choo&s;e, no doubt, that you &s;hould owe to them&s;elves, and not to my humble mediation, the favour you &s;o earne&s;tly &s;ue for, and which I would not have you de&s;pair of: For I will venture to a&s;&s;ure you, that your mother is ready to take the fir&s;t opportunity to &s;hew her maternal tenderne&s;s for you: And this I gather from &s;eve|ral hints I am not at liberty to explain my&s;elf upon.</P>
<P>I long to be with you, now I am better, and now my &s;on is in a fine way of recovery. But is it not hard, to have it &s;ignified to me, that at pre&s;ent it will not be taken well, if I go?&mdash;I &s;uppo&s;e, while the reconciliation, which I hope will take place, is negotiating by means of the cor|re&s;pondence

&s;o newly opened between you and your &s;i&s;ter. But if you would have me come, I will rely on my good intentions, and ri&s;que every-one's di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Mr. Brand has bu&s;ine&s;s in town, to &s;olicit for a bene|fice which it is expected the incumbent will be obliged to quit for a better preferment: And when there, he is to inquire privately after your way of life, and of your health.</P>
<P>He is a very officious young man; and, but that your uncle Harlowe (who has cho&s;en him for this errand) re|gards him as an oracle, your mother had rather any-body el&s;e had been &s;ent.</P>
<P>He is one of tho&s;e puzzling, over-doing gentlemen, who think they &s;ee farther into matters than any-body el&s;e, and are fond of di&s;co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ering my&s;teries where there are none, in order to be thought a &s;hrewd man.</P>
<P>I can't &s;ay I like him, either in the pulpit, or out of it: I who had a father one of the &s;ounde&s;t divines, and fine&s;t &s;cholars, in the kingdom; who never made an o&s;tentation of what he knew; but loved and venerated the go&s;pel he taught, preferring it to all other learning; to be obliged to hear a young man depart from his text as &s;oon as he has named it (&s;o contrary, too, to the example &s;et him by his learned and worthy principal <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dr.</HI> Lewin.</NOTE>, when his health permits him to preach), and throwing about, to a Chri&s;tian and Country audience, &s;craps of Latin and Greek from the pa|gan cla&s;&s;ics; and not always brought in with great pro|priety neither (if I am to judge, by the only way given me to judge of them, by the Engli&s;h he puts them into); is an indication of &s;omething wrong, either in his head, or his heart, or both; for, otherwi&s;e, his education at the Univer&s;ity mu&s;t have taught him better. You know, my dear Mi&s;s Clary, the honour I have for the Cloth: It is owing to <HI>that,</HI> that I &s;ay what I do.</P>
<P>I know not the day he is to &s;et out; and as his inqui|ries are to be private, be plea&s;ed to take no notice of this intelligence. I have no doubt, that your life and conver|&s;ation are &s;uch, as may defy the &s;crutinies of the mo&s;t offi|cious inquirer.</P>
<P>I am ju&s;t now told, that you have written a &s;econd let|ter
<PB N="319" REF="320">
to your &s;i&s;ter: But am afraid they will wait for Mr. Brand's report, before further favour will be obtained from them; for they will not yet believe you are &s;o ill, as I fear you are.</P>
<P>But you would &s;oon find, that you have an indulgent mother, were &s;he at liberty to act according to her own inclination. And this gives me great hopes, that all will end well at la&s;t: For I verily think you are in the right way to a reconciliation: God give a ble&s;&s;ing to it, and re|&s;tore your health, and you to all your friends, prays</P>

<P>Your good mamma has privately &s;ent me five guineas: She is plea&s;ed to &s;ay, to help us in the illne&s;s we have been afflicted with; but, more likely, that I might &s;end them to you, as from my&s;elf. I hope, therefore, I may &s;end them up, with ten more I have &s;till left.</P>
<P>I will &s;end you word of Mr. Morden's arrival, the mo|ment I know it.</P>

<P>YOU give me, my dear Mrs. Norton, great plea&s;ure in hearing of yours and your &s;on's recovery. May you continue, for many, many years, a ble&s;&s;ing to each other!</P>
<P>You tell me, that you did actually write to my mamma, <HI>offering</HI> to inclo&s;e mine of the 24th pa&s;t: And you &s;ay, It was not <HI>required</HI> of you. That is to &s;ay, altho' you cover it over as gently as you could, that your offer was reject|ed; which makes it evident, that no plea will be heard for me. Yet, you bid me hope, that the grace I &s;ued for would, <HI>in time,</HI> be granted.</P>
<P>The grace I then &s;ued for was indeed granted: But you are afraid, you &s;ay, that they will wait for Mr. Brand's report, before favour will be obtained in return to the &s;e|cond letter, which I wrote to my &s;i&s;ter: And you add,
<PB N="320" REF="321">
That I have an indulgent mamma, were &s;he at liberty to act according to her own inclination; and that all will end well at la&s;t.</P>
<P>But what, my dear Mrs. Norton, what is the grace I &s;ue for in my &s;econd letter? &mdash; It is not that they will re|ceive me into favour&mdash; If they think it is, they are mi&s;taken. I do not, I cannot expect that: Nor, as I have often &s;aid, &s;hould I, if they <HI>would</HI> receive me, bear to live in the eye of tho&s;e dear friends whom I have &s;o grievou&s;ly of|fended. 'Tis only, &s;imply, a ble&s;&s;ing I a&s;k: A ble&s;&s;ing to <HI>die</HI> with; not to <HI>live</HI> with.&mdash;Do they know that? And do they know, that their unkindne&s;s will perhaps &s;horten my date? So that their favour, if ever they intend to grant it, may come too late?</P>
<P>Once more, I de&s;ire you not to think of coming to me. I have no unea&s;ine&s;s now, but what proceeds from the apprehen&s;ion of &s;eeing a man I would not &s;ee for the world, if I could help it; and from the &s;everity of my neare&s;t and deare&s;t relations: A &s;everity intirely their own, I doubt; for you tell me, that my brother is at Edinburgh! You would therefore heighten their &s;everity, and make your&s;elf enemies be&s;ides, if you were to come to me&mdash; Don't you &s;ee that you would?</P>
<P>Mr. Brand may come, if he will. He is a Clergyman, and mu&s;t mean well; or I mu&s;t think &s;o, let him &s;ay of me what he will. All my fear is, that, as he knows I am in di&s;grace with a family who&s;e e&s;teem he is de&s;irous to cultivate; and as he has obligations to my uncle Harlowe, and to my father; he will be but a languid acquitter. Not that I am afraid of what he, or any-body in the world, can hear as to my conduct. You may, my beloved and dear friend, indeed you may, re&s;t &s;atisfied, that That is &s;uch as may warrant me to challenge the inquiries of the mo&s;t officious.</P>
<P>I will &s;end you copies of what pa&s;&s;es, as you de&s;ire, when I have an an&s;wer to my &s;econd letter. I now begin to wi&s;h, that I had taken the heart to write to my father him&s;elf; or to my mother, at lea&s;t; in&s;tead of to my &s;i&s;ter; and yet I doubt my poor mother can do nothing for me of <HI>herself.</HI> A &s;trong confederacy, my dear Mrs. Norton, (a &s;trong confederacy indeed!) again&s;t a poor girl, their daugh|ter,

<P>Don't afflict your&s;elf about money-matters on my ac|count. I have no occa&s;ion for money. I am glad my mother was &s;o con&s;iderate to you. I was in pain for you, on the &s;ame &s;ubject.

<P>I AM mo&s;t confoundedly chagrined and di&s;appointed: For here, on Saturday, arrived a me&s;&s;enger from Mi&s;s Howe, with a letter to my cou&s;ins <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Letter <HI>lxxx.</HI> p. <HI>296.</HI></NOTE>; which I knew nothing of till ye&s;terday; when my two aunts were pro|cured to be here, to &s;it in judgment upon it with the old Peer, and my two kin&s;women. And never was Bear &s;o mi&s;erably baited as thy poor friend!&mdash;And for what?&mdash; Why, for the cruelty of Mi&s;s Harlowe: For have I com|mitted any <HI>new</HI> offence? And would I not have &s;ucceeded in her favour, upon her own terms, if I could? And is it fair to puni&s;h me for what is my misfortune, and not my fault? Such event-judging fools as I have for my relations! I am a&s;hamed of them all.</P>
<P>In that of Mi&s;s Howe was inclo&s;ed one to <HI>her</HI> from Mi&s;s Harlowe <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">See Letter <HI>lxxvi.</HI> p. <HI>278.</HI></NOTE>, to be &s;ent to my cou&s;ins, containing a final rejec|tion of me; and that in very vehement and po&s;itive terms;
<PB N="322" REF="323">
yet pretends, that in this rejection &s;he is governed more by <HI>principle</HI> than <HI>pa&s;&s;ion</HI>&mdash;(Damn'd lye, as ever was told!) And, as a proof that &s;he is, &s;ays, that &s;he <HI>can</HI> forgive me, and <HI>does,</HI> on this one condition, That I will never mole&s;t her more: The whole letter &s;o written, as to make <HI>her&s;elf</HI> more admired, <HI>me</HI> more dete&s;ted.</P>
<P>What we have been told of the agitations and work|ings, and &s;ighings and &s;obbings, of the French prophets among us formerly, were nothing at all to the &s;cene ex|hibited by the&s;e maudlin &s;ouls, at the reading of the&s;e let|ters; and of &s;ome affecting pa&s;&s;ages extracted from an|other of my fair Implacable's to Mi&s;s Howe&mdash;Such lamenta|tions for the lo&s;s of &s;o charming a relation! Such applaud|ings of her virtue, of her exaltedne&s;s of &s;oul and &s;entiment! Such menaces of di&s;inheri&s;ons! I, not needing <HI>their</HI> re|proaches to be &s;tung to the heart with my own reflec|tions, and with the rage of di&s;appointment; and as &s;in|cerely as any of them admiring her&mdash; What the devil, cried I&punc; is all this for? &mdash; Is it not enough to be de&s;pi&s;ed and rejected? Can I help her implacable &s;pirit?&mdash;Would I not repair the evils I have made her &s;uffer?&mdash;Then was I ready to cur&s;e them all, her&s;elf and Mi&s;s Howe, for com|pany&mdash;And heartily I &s;wore, that &s;he &s;hould yet be mine.</P>
<P>I now &s;wear it over-again to thee&mdash;Were her death to follow in a week after the knot is ty'd, by the Lord of Heaven, it <HI>&s;hall</HI> be ty'd, and &s;he &s;hall die a Lovelace.&mdash; Tell her &s;o, if thou wilt: But, at the &s;ame time, tell her, that I have no <HI>view to her fortune;</HI> and that I will &s;olemnly re&s;ign that, and all preten&s;ions to it, in who&s;e favour &s;he plea&s;es, if &s;he re&s;ign life i&s;&s;uele&s;s.&mdash; I am not &s;o low-minded a wretch, as to be <HI>guilty</HI> of any &s;ordid views to her fortune: Let her judge for her&s;elf then, whether it be not for her honour rather to leave this world a Lovelace than a Harlowe.</P>
<P>But do not think I will intirely re&s;t a cau&s;e &s;o near my heart, upon an advocate, who &s;o much more admires his client's adver&s;ary, than his client. I will go to town in a few days, in order to throw my&s;elf at her feet: Bringing with me, or having at hand, a <HI>re&s;olute, well-prepared</HI> par|&s;on; and the ceremony &s;hall be performed, let what will be the con&s;equence.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="324">But if &s;he will permit me to attend her for this purpo&s;e, at either of the churches mentioned in the licence (which &s;he has by her, and, thank Heaven! has not returned me with my letters); then will I not di&s;turb her; but meet her at the altar in either church, and will engage to bring my two cou&s;ins to attend her, and even Lady Sarah and Lady Betty, and my Lord M. in per&s;on, to give her to me.</P>
<P>Or, if it will be &s;till more agreeable to her; I will un|dertake, that either or both my aunts &s;hall go to town, and attend her down; and the marriage &s;hall be celebrated in theirs and Lord M.'s pre&s;ence, here, or el&s;ewhere, at her own choice.</P>
<P>Do not play me booty, Belford; but &s;incerely and warmly u&s;e all the eloquence thou art ma&s;ter of, to pre|vail upon her to choo&s;e one of the&s;e three methods. One of them &s;he <HI>mu&s;t</HI> choo&s;e &mdash; By my &s;oul, &s;he mu&s;t.</P>
<P>Here is Charlotte tapping at my clo&s;et-door for admit|tance. What a devil wants Charlotte?&mdash; I will bear no more reproaches!&mdash;Come in, girl!</P>
<P>MY cou&s;in Charlotte, finding me writing on with too much earne&s;tne&s;s to have any regard for politene&s;s to her, and gue&s;&s;ing at my &s;ubject, be&s;ought me to let her &s;ee what I had written.</P>
<P>I obliged her. And &s;he was &s;o highly plea&s;ed on &s;eeing me &s;o much in earne&s;t, that <HI>&s;he</HI> offered, and I accepted her offer, to write her&s;elf to Mi&s;s Harlowe; with permi&s;|&s;ion to treat me in it as &s;he thought fit.</P>
<P>I &s;hall inclo&s;e a copy of her letter.</P>
<P>When &s;he <HI>had</HI> written it, &s;he brought it to me, with apologies for the freedom taken with me in it: But I ex|cu&s;ed it; and &s;he was ready to give me a ki&s;s for joy of my approbation: And I gave her two for writing it; tell|ing her, I had hopes of &s;ucce&s;s from it; and that I thought &s;he had luckily hit it off.</P>
<P>Every-one approves of it, as well as I, and is plea&s;ed with me, for &s;o patiently &s;ubmitting to be abu&s;ed, and undertaken for.&mdash; If it do not &s;ucceed, all the blame will be thrown upon the dear creature's perver&s;ene&s;s: Her cha|ritable or forgiving di&s;po&s;ition, about which &s;he makes &s;uch a parade, will be ju&s;tly que&s;tioned; and the pity of
<PB N="324" REF="325">
which &s;he is now in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, will be transferred to me.</P>
<P>Putting therefore my whole confidence in this letter, I po&s;tpone all my other alternatives, as al&s;o my going to town, till my empre&s;s &s;end an an&s;wer to my cou&s;in Mon|tague.</P>
<P>But if &s;he per&s;i&s;t, and will not promi&s;e to take time to <HI>con&s;ider</HI> of the matter, thou maye&s;t communicate to her what I had written, as above, before my cou&s;in entered; and, if &s;he be &s;till perver&s;e, a&s;&s;ure her, that I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> and <HI>will</HI> &s;ee her&mdash; But this with all honour, all humility: And, if I cannot move her in my favour, I will then go abroad, and perhaps never more return to England.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry thou art, at <HI>this critical time,</HI> &s;o bu&s;ily employed, as thou informe&s;t me thou art, in thy Watford affairs, and in preparing to do Belton ju&s;tice. If thou wante&s;t my a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the latter, command me. Tho' ingro&s;&s;ed and plagued as I am, with this perver&s;e beauty, I will obey thy fir&s;t &s;ummons.</P>
<P>I have great dependence upon thy zeal and thy friend|&s;hip: Ha&s;ten back to her, therefore, and re&s;ume a ta&s;k <HI>&s;o</HI> intere&s;ting to me, that it is equally the &s;ubject of my dreams, as of my waking hours.</P>

<P>I Have been &s;o much employed in my own and Belton's affairs, that I could not come to town till la&s;t night; having contented my&s;elf with &s;ending to Mrs. Lovick, to know, from time to time, the &s;tate of the lady's health; of which I received but very indifferent accounts, owing, in a great mea&s;ure, to letters or advices brought her from her implacable family.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM infinitely obliged to you for your kind and con|de&s;cending letter. A letter, however, which height|ens my regrets, as it gives me a new in&s;tance of what a happy creature I might have been in an alliance &s;o much approved of by &s;uch worthy Ladies; and which, on their accounts, and on that of Lord M. would have been &s;o re|putable to my&s;elf, and once &s;o de&s;irable.</P>
<P>But indeed, indeed, Madam, my heart &s;incerely re|pul&s;es the man, who, de&s;cended from &s;uch a family, could be guilty, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> of &s;uch premeditated violence as he has been guilty of; and, as <HI>he</HI> knows, <HI>further</HI> intended me, on the night previous to the day he &s;et out for Berk&s;hire; and, <HI>next,</HI> pretending to &s;pirit, be &s;o mean, as to wi&s;h to lift into that family a per&s;on he was capable of aba&s;ing into a companion&s;hip with the mo&s;t abandoned of her Sex.</P>
<P>Allow me then, dear Madam, to declare with fervour, that I think I never could de&s;erve to be ranked with the
<PB N="327" REF="328">
Ladies of a family &s;o &s;plendid and &s;o noble, if, by vowing love and honour at the altar to &s;uch a violator, I could <HI>&s;anctify,</HI> as I may &s;ay, his unprecedented and elaborate wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>Permit me, however, to make one reque&s;t to my good Lord M. and to the two Ladies his Lord&s;hip's &s;i&s;ters, and to your kind &s;elf, and your &s;i&s;ter&mdash; It is, That you will all be plea&s;ed to join your authority and intere&s;ts to prevail upon Mr. Lovelace not to mole&s;t me further.</P>
<P>Be plea&s;ed to tell him, That, if I am de&s;igned for <HI>life,</HI> it will be very cruel in him to attempt to hunt me out of it; for I am determined never to &s;ee him more, if I can help it.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have frequently offered to oblige me in any-thing that &s;hall be within your power: And I have &s;uch an opinion of you, as to be willing to hope you meant me, at the times, more than mere compliment.</P>
<P>I have therefore two reque&s;ts to make to you; the fir&s;t I will now mention; the other, if this &s;hall be comply'd with, otherwi&s;e not.</P>
<P>It behoves me to leave behind me &s;uch an account as may clear up my conduct to &s;everal of my friends who will not at pre&s;ent concern them&s;elves about me: And Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s Howe, and her mother, are very &s;olicitous that I will do &s;o.</P>
<P>I am apprehen&s;ive, that I &s;hall not have time to do this; and you will not wonder, that I have le&s;s and le&s;s in|clination to &s;et about &s;uch a painful ta&s;k; e&s;pecially as I find my&s;elf unable to look back with patience on what I have &s;uffered; and &s;hall be too much di&s;compo&s;ed by it, to proceed with the requi&s;ite temper in a ta&s;k of <HI>&s;till greater</HI> importance, which I have before me.</P>
<P>It is very evident to me, that your wicked friend has given you, from time to time, a circum&s;tantial account of all his behaviour <HI>to</HI> me, and devices <HI>again&s;t</HI> me; and you have more than once a&s;&s;ured me, that, both by writing and &s;peech, he has done my character all the ju&s;tice I could wi&s;h for.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, if I may have a fair, a faithful &s;pecimen from his letters or accounts to you, upon &s;ome of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting occa&s;ions, I &s;hall be able to judge, whether there will or will not be a nece&s;&s;ity for me, for my honour's &s;ake, to enter upon the &s;olicited ta&s;k.</P>
<P>You may be a&s;&s;ured, from my inclo&s;ed an&s;wer to the letter which Mi&s;s Montague has honoured me with (and which you'll be plea&s;ed to return me as &s;oon as read), that it is impo&s;&s;ible for me ever to think of your friend, in the way I am importuned to think of him: He cannot there|fore receive any detriment from the reque&s;ted &s;pecimen: And I give you my honour, that no u&s;e &s;hall be made of it to his prejudice, in Law, or otherwi&s;e. And that it
<PB N="329" REF="330">
may <HI>not,</HI> after I am no more, I a&s;&s;ure you, that it is a <HI>main part of my view,</HI> that the pa&s;&s;ages you &s;hall oblige me with &s;hall be always in your own power, and not in that of any other per&s;on.</P>
<P>If, Sir, you think fit to comply with my reque&s;t, the pa&s;&s;ages I would wi&s;h to be tran&s;cribed (making neither better nor wor&s;e of the matter), are tho&s;e which he has written to you, on or about the 7th and 8th of June, when I was alarmed by the wicked pretence of a fire; and what he has written from Sunday June 11. to the 19th. And in doing this you will much oblige</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Now, Lovelace, &s;ince there are no hopes for thee of her returning favour; Since &s;ome prai&s;e may lie for thy in|genuity, having never offered (as more diminutive-minded libertines would have done) to palliate thy crimes, by a&s;per&s;ing the lady, or her &s;ex; Since &s;he may be made ea&s;ier by it; Since thou mu&s;t fare better from thy own pen, than from hers; and, finally, Since thy actions have mani|fe&s;ted, that thy letters are not the mo&s;t guilty part of what &s;he <HI>knows</HI> of thee; I &s;ee not why I may not oblige her, upon her honour, and under the re&s;trictions, and for the rea&s;ons &s;he has given; and this without breach of the confidence due to friendly communications; e&s;pecially, as I might have added, <HI>Since thou glorie&s;t in thy pen, and in thy wicked|ne&s;s, and can&s;t not be a&s;hamed.</HI></P>
<P>But, be this as it may, &s;he <HI>will</HI> be obliged before thy remon&s;trances or clamours again&s;t it can come; &s;o, pr'ythee now, make the be&s;t of it, and rave not; except for the &s;ake of a pretence again&s;t me, and to exerci&s;e thy talent of execration!&mdash;And, if thou like&s;t to do &s;o for the&s;e rea|&s;ons, rave and welcome.</P>
<P>I long to know what the &s;econd reque&s;t is: But this I know, that if it be any-thing le&s;s than cutting <HI>thy</HI> throat, or endangering <HI>my own</HI> neck, I will certainly comply; and be proud of having it in my power to oblige her.</P>

<P>YOU have engaged me to communicate to you, upon honour (making neither better nor wor&s;e of the matter), what Mr. Lovelace has written to me, in relation to your&s;elf, in the period preceding your going to Ham|&s;tead, and in that between the 11th and 19th of June: And you a&s;&s;ure me, you have no view in this reque&s;t, but to &s;ee if it be nece&s;&s;ary for you, from the account he gives, to touch the painful &s;ubjects your&s;elf, for the &s;ake of your own character.</P>
<P>Your commands, Madam, are of a very delicate na|ture, as they may &s;eem to affect the &s;ecrets of private friend|&s;hip: But as I know you are not capable of a view, the motives to which you will not own; and as I think the communication may do &s;ome credit to my unhappy friend's character, as an <HI>ingenuous</HI> man; tho' his actions by the mo&s;t excellent woman in the world have lo&s;t him all title to that of an <HI>honourable</HI> one; I obey you with the greater chearfulne&s;s.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Friday, Aug.</HI> 4.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Hold my&s;elf extremely obliged to you for your com|munications. I will make no u&s;e of them, that you &s;hall have rea&s;on to reproach either your&s;elf or me with. I wanted no new lights to make the unhappy man's pre|meditated ba&s;ene&s;s to me unque&s;tionable, as my an&s;wer to Mi&s;s Montague's letter might convince you <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Letter <HI>xciii.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t own in his favour, that he has ob&s;erved &s;ome decency in his accounts to you of the mo&s;t indecent and &s;hocking actions. And if all his &s;trangely-communicative narrations are equally decent, nothing will be rendered criminally odious by them, but the vile heart that could meditate &s;uch contrivances as were much &s;tronger evidences of his inhumanity, than of his wit: Since men of very
<PB N="332" REF="333">
contemptible parts and under&s;tanding may &s;ucceed in the vile&s;t attempts, if they can get above regarding the moral &s;anctions which bind man to man; and &s;ooner upon an innocent heart, than upon any other; becau&s;e, knowing its own integrity, it is the le&s;s apt to &s;u&s;pect that of others.</P>
<P>I find I have had great rea&s;on to think my&s;elf obliged to your intention in the whole progre&s;s of my &s;ufferings. It is, however, impo&s;&s;ible, Sir, to mi&s;s the natural infer|ence on this occa&s;ion, that lies again&s;t his predetermined ba&s;ene&s;s. But I &s;ay the le&s;s, becau&s;e you &s;hall not think I borrow from your communications aggravations that are not needed.</P>
<P>And now, Sir, that I may &s;pare you the trouble of offer|ing any future arguments in his favour, let me tell you, that I have weighed every-thing thoroughly: All that hu|man vanity could &s;ugge&s;t; All that a de&s;irable reconcilia|tion with my friends, and the kind re&s;pects of his own, could bid me hope for: The enjoyment of Mi&s;s Howe's friend&s;hip, the deare&s;t con&s;ideration to me now, of all worldly ones: All the&s;e I have weighed: And the re&s;ult is, and <HI>was</HI> before you favoured me with the&s;e communi|cations, that I have more &s;atisfaction in the hope, that, in one month, there will be an end of All with me, than in the mo&s;t agreeable things that could happen from an alli|ance with Mr. Lovelace, altho' I were to be a&s;&s;ured he would make the be&s;t and tendere&s;t of hu&s;bands. But as to the re&s;t; If, &s;atisfied with the evils he has brought up|on me, he will forbear all further per&s;ecutions of me, I will, to my la&s;t hour, wi&s;h him good: Altho' <HI>he hath over|whelmed the fatherle&s;s, and digged a pit for his friend:</HI> Fa|therle&s;s may <HI>&s;he</HI> well be called, and motherle&s;s too, who has been denied all paternal protection, and motherly for|givene&s;s.</P>
<P>AND now, Sir, acknowleging gratefully your favour in the Extracts, I come to the &s;econd part of my reque&s;t: Which requires a great deal of courage to mention to you: And which courage nothing but a great deal of di&s;tre&s;s, and a very de&s;titute condition, can give. But, if impro|per, I can but be denied; and dare to &s;ay, I &s;hall be at lea&s;t excu&s;ed. Thus, then, I preface it:</P>
<P><PB N="333" REF="334">You &s;ee, Sir, that I am thrown ab&s;olutely into the hands of &s;trangers, who, altho' as kind and compa&s;&s;ionate as &s;trangers can be wi&s;hed to be, are neverthele&s;s per&s;ons from whom I cannot expect any-thing more than pity and good wi&s;hes; nor can my memory receive from them any more protection than my per&s;on, if either &s;hould need it.</P>
<P>If then I reque&s;t it, of the <HI>only</HI> gentleman po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of materials that will enable him, to do my character ju&s;tice;</P>
<P>And who has courage, independence, and ability to ob|lige me;</P>
<P>To be the protector of my memory, as I may &s;ay;</P>
<P>And to be my <HI>Executor;</HI> and to &s;ee &s;ome of my dying reque&s;ts performed;</P>
<P>(And if I leave it to him to do the whole in his own way, manner, and time; con&s;ulting, however, in requi|&s;ite ca&s;es, my dear Mi&s;s Howe);</P>
<P>I pre&s;ume to hope, that this part of my reque&s;t may be granted.</P>
<P>And if it may, The&s;e &s;atisfactions will accrue to me from the favour done me, and the office undertaken:</P>
<P>It will be an honour to my memory, with all tho&s;e who &s;hall know, that I was &s;o well &s;atisfied of my innocence, that, having not time to write my own &s;tory, I could in|tru&s;t it to the relation which the de&s;troyer of my fame and fortunes has given of it.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not be apprehen&s;ive of involving any one in trou|bles or hazards by this ta&s;k, either with my own relations, or with your friend; having di&s;po&s;itions to make, which perhaps my own friends will not be &s;o well plea&s;ed with as it were to be wi&s;hed they would be; for I intend not unrea&s;onable ones: But you know, Sir, where <HI>Self</HI> is judge, matters, even with <HI>good people,</HI> will not always be rightly judged of.</P>
<P>I &s;hall al&s;o be freed from the pain of recollecting things, that my &s;oul is vexed at; and this at a time when its tu|mults &s;hould be allay'd, in order to make way for the mo&s;t important preparation.</P>
<P>And who knows, but that the man, who already, from a principle of humanity, is touched at my misfortunes, when he comes to revolve the whole &s;tory, placed before

him in one &s;trong light, and when he &s;hall have the cata|&s;trophe likewi&s;e before him; and &s;hall become in a man|ner, intere&s;ted in it: Who knows, but that, from a &s;till higher principle, he may &s;o regulate his future actions, as to find his own reward, in the everla&s;ting welfare which is wi&s;hed him by his</P>

<P>I AM &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the honour done me in yours of this day, that I would not delay for one moment the an|&s;wering of it.

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Friday night, Aug.</HI> 4.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Have actually delivered to the lady the extracts &s;he re|que&s;ted me to give her from thy letters. I do a&s;&s;ure thee, that I have made the very be&s;t of the matter for thee, <HI>not</HI> that con&s;cience, but that friend&s;hip, could oblige me to make. I have changed or omitted &s;ome free words. The warm de&s;cription of her per&s;on in the <HI>fire-&s;cene,</HI> as I may call it, I have omitted. I have told her, that I have done ju&s;tice to you, in the ju&s;tice you have done to her unexampled virtue. But take the very words which I wrote to her immediately following the extracts:</P>
<P>'And now, Madam,'&mdash;<HI>See the paragraph marked with inverted commas</HI> ['thus] p. 330.</P>
<P>The lady is extremely unea&s;y at the thoughts of your attempting to vi&s;it her. For Heaven's &s;ake (your word being given), and for Pity's &s;ake (for &s;he is really in a very weak and langui&s;hing way), let me beg of you not to think of it.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday afternoon &s;he received a cruel letter, as Mrs. Lovick &s;uppo&s;es it to be, by the effect it had upon her, from her &s;i&s;ter, in an&s;wer to one written la&s;t Saturday, intreating a ble&s;&s;ing and forgivene&s;s from her parents.</P>
<P>She acknowleges, that, if all thy letters are written with equal decency and ju&s;tice, as I have a&s;&s;ured her they are, &s;he &s;hall think her&s;elf freed from the nece&s;&s;ity of write|ing her own &s;tory: And this is an advantage to the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ac|cruing from the extracts I have obliged her with; tho' thou, perhaps, wilt not thank me for &s;o doing.</P>
<P>But what thinke&s;t thou is the &s;econd reque&s;t &s;he had to make to me? No other than that I would be her <HI>Execu|tor!</HI> &mdash; Her motives will appear before thee in proper time; and then, I dare an&s;wer for them, will be &s;atisfac|tory.</P>
<P>You cannot imagine how proud I am of this tru&s;t. I am afraid I &s;hall too &s;oon come into the execution of it. As &s;he is always writing, what a melancholy plea&s;ure
<PB N="336" REF="337">
will the peru&s;al and di&s;po&s;ition of her papers afford me! Such a &s;weetne&s;s of temper, &s;o much patience and re&s;igna|tion, as &s;he &s;eems to be mi&s;tre&s;s of; yet writing of and in the mid&s;t of <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> di&s;tre&s;&s;es! How much more lively and affecting, for that rea&s;on, mu&s;t her &s;tile be, than all that can be read in the dry, narrative, unanimated &s;tile of per&s;ons relating difficulties and dangers &s;urmounted! The minds of &s;uch not labouring in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, not tortured by the pangs of uncertainty, about events &s;till hidden in the womb of fate; but, on the contrary, perfectly at ea&s;e; the relater unmoved by his own &s;tory, how then able to move the hearer or reader?</P>

<P>I AM ju&s;t returned from vi&s;iting the lady, and thank|ing her in per&s;on for the honour &s;he has done me; and a&s;&s;uring her, if called to the &s;acred tru&s;t, of the utmo&s;t fidelity and exactne&s;s. I found her very ill. I took notice of it. She &s;aid, She had received a &s;econd hard-hearted letter from her &s;i&s;ter; and &s;he had been writing a letter (and that on her knees) directly to her mother; which be|fore &s;he had not the courage to do. It was for a la&s;t ble&s;&s;|ing, and forgivene&s;s. No wonder, &s;he &s;aid, that I &s;aw her affected. Now that I had accepted of the la&s;t charitable office for her (for which, as well as for complying with her other reque&s;t, &s;he thanked me) I &s;hould one day have all the&s;e letters before me: And could &s;he have a kind one, in return to that &s;he had been now writing, to coun|terbalance the unkind one &s;he had from her &s;i&s;ter, &s;he might be induced to &s;hew me both together.</P>
<P>I knew &s;he would be di&s;plea&s;ed, if I had cen&s;ured the cruelty of her relations; I therefore only &s;aid, That &s;urely &s;he mu&s;t have enemies, who hoped to find their account in keeping up the re&s;entments of her friends again&s;t her.</P>
<P>It may be &s;o, Mr. Belford, &s;aid &s;he: The unhappy never want enemies. One fault, wilfully committed, au|thorizes the imputation of many more. Where the ear is opened to accu&s;ations, accu&s;ers will not be wanting; and every-one will officiou&s;ly come with &s;tories again&s;t a di&s;graced child, where nothing dare be &s;aid in her fa|vour. I &s;hould have been wi&s;e in time, and not have needed to be convinced, by my own misfortunes, of the
<PB N="337" REF="338">
truth of what common experience daily demon&s;trates. Mr. Lovelace's ba&s;ene&s;s, my father's inflexibility, my &s;i&s;ter's reproaches, are the natural con&s;equences of my own ra&s;h|ne&s;s; &s;o I mu&s;t make the be&s;t of my hard lot. Only, as the&s;e con&s;equences follow one another &s;o clo&s;ely, while they are <HI>new,</HI> how can I help being anew affected?</P>
<P>I a&s;ked, If a letter written by my&s;elf, by her doctor or apothecary, to any of her friends, repre&s;enting her low &s;tate of health, and great humility, would be acceptable? Or if a journey to any of them would be of &s;ervice, I would gladly undertake it in per&s;on, and &s;trictly conform to her orders, to whom&s;oever &s;he would direct me to apply.</P>
<P>She earne&s;tly de&s;ired, that nothing of this &s;ort might be attempted, e&s;pecially without her knowlege and con&s;ent. Mi&s;s Howe, &s;he &s;aid, had done harm by her kindly-in|tended zeal; and if there were room to expect favour by mediation, &s;he had ready at hand a kind friend, Mrs. Norton, who for piety and prudence had few equals; and who would let &s;lip no opportunity to do her &s;ervice.</P>
<P>I let her know, that I was going out of town till Mon|day: She wi&s;h'd me plea&s;ure; and &s;aid, &s;he &s;hould be glad to &s;ee me on my return.</P>

<P>Wherefore, on my knees, my ever-honoured mamma, (for on my knees I write this letter) I do mo&s;t humbly beg your Ble&s;&s;ing: Say but, in &s;o many words (I a&s;k you not to call me your daughter) &mdash; <HI>Lo&s;t, unhappy wretch, I forgive you! and may God ble&s;s you!</HI>&mdash;This is all!

<P>I am, however, commanded to write in all the &s;ub|&s;cribing names, to let you know, how greatly your &s;uf|ferings have affected us: To tell you, that my Lord M. has forbid him ever more to darken the doors of the apart|ments where he &s;hall be: And as you labour under the unhappy effects of your friends di&s;plea&s;ure, which may &s;ubject you to inconveniencies, his Lord&s;hip, and Lady Sarah, and Lady Betty, beg of you to accept, for your life, or, at lea&s;t, till you are admitted to enjoy your own e&s;tate, of one hundred guineas <HI>per</HI> quarter, which will be regu|larly brought you by an e&s;pecial hand, and of the inclo&s;ed Bank bill for a beginning. And do not, deare&s;t Madam, we all be&s;eech you, do not think you are beholden for this token of Lord M.'s and Lady Sarah's and Lady Betty's love to you, to the <HI>friends of this vile man;</HI> for he has not one friend left among us.</P>
<P>We each of us de&s;ire to be favoured with a place in your e&s;teem; and to be con&s;idered upon the &s;ame foot of relation&s;hip, as if what once was &s;o much our plea&s;ure to

hope <HI>would</HI> be, <HI>had</HI> been. And it &s;hall be our united prayer, that you may recover health and &s;pirits, and live to &s;ee many happy years: And, &s;ince this wretch can no more be pleaded for, that, when he is gone abroad, as he now is preparing to do, we may be permitted the honour of a per&s;onal acquaintance with a lady who has no equal.

<P>You will break the hearts of the three fir&s;t-named more particularly, if you refu&s;e them your acceptance. Deare&s;t Mi&s;s Harlowe, puni&s;h not <HI>them</HI> for <HI>his</HI> crimes. We &s;end by a particular hand, which will bring us, we hope, your accepting favour.</P>
<P>Mr. Lovelace writes by the &s;ame hand; but he knows nothing of ours, nor we of his: For we &s;hun each other; and one part of the hou&s;e holds <HI>us,</HI> another <HI>him,</HI> the remote&s;t from each other.</P>

<P>I Am &s;o exce&s;&s;ively di&s;turbed at the contents of Mi&s;s Harlowe's an&s;wer to my cou&s;in Charlotte's letter of Tue&s;day la&s;t (which was given her by the &s;ame fellow that gave me yours), that I have hardly patience or con&s;idera|tion enough to weigh what you write.</P>
<P>She had need, indeed, to cry out for mercy her&s;elf from <HI>her</HI> friends, who knows not how to &s;hew any! She is a true daughter of the Harlowes&mdash;By my &s;oul, Jack, &s;he is a true daughter of the Harlowes! Yet has &s;he &s;o many excellencies, that I mu&s;t love her; and, fool that I am, love her the more for her de&s;pi&s;ing me.</P>
<P>Thou runne&s;t on with thy cur&s;ed non&s;en&s;ical <HI>reformado</HI>-rote,
<PB N="342" REF="343">
of dying, dying, dying! and, having once got the word by the end, can&s;t not help foi&s;ting it in at every pe|riod! The devil take me, if I don't think thou would&s;t give her poi&s;on with thy own hands, rather than &s;he &s;hould re|cover, and rob thee of the merit of being a conjurer!</P>
<P>But no more of thy cur&s;ed knell; thy changes upon death's candle&s;tick turned bottom-upwards: She'll live to bury me; I &s;ee that: For, by my &s;oul, I can neither eat, drink, nor &s;leep; nor, what's &s;till wor&s;e, love any woman in the world but her. Nor care I to look upon a woman now; on the contrary, I turn my head from every one I meet; except by chance an eye, an air, a feature, &s;trikes me re&s;embling hers in &s;ome glancing-by face; and then I cannot forbear looking again; tho' the &s;econd look recovers me; for there can be no-body like her.</P>
<P>But &s;urely, Belford, the devil's in this lady! The more I think of her non&s;en&s;e and ob&s;tinacy, the le&s;s patience I have with her. Is it po&s;&s;ible &s;he can do her&s;elf, her fa|mily, her friends, &s;o much ju&s;tice any <HI>other</HI> way, as by marrying me? Were &s;he &s;ure &s;he &s;hould live but a day, &s;he ought to die a wife. If her <HI>Chri&s;tian revenge</HI> will not let her wi&s;h to do &s;o for her <HI>own</HI> &s;ake, ought &s;he not for the &s;ake of her family, and of her Sex, which &s;he pretends &s;ometimes to have &s;o much concern for? And if no <HI>&s;ake</HI> is dear enough to move her Harlowe-&s;pirit in my favour, has &s;he any title to the pity thou &s;o pitifully art always be|&s;peaking for her?</P>
<P>As to the difference which her letter has made between me and the &s;tupid family here (and I mu&s;t tell thee we are all broke in pieces) I value not that of a button. They are fools to anathematize and cur&s;e me, who can give them ten cur&s;es for one, were they to hold it for a day together.</P>
<P>I have one half of the hou&s;e to my&s;elf; and that the be&s;t; for the Great enjoy that lea&s;t, which co&s;ts them mo&s;t: <HI>Grandeur</HI> and <HI>U&s;e</HI> are two things: The common part is theirs; the &s;tate part is mine: And here I lord it, and <HI>will</HI> lord it, as long as I plea&s;e; while the two pur&s;y &s;i&s;ters, the old gouty brother, and the two mu&s;ty nieces, are &s;tived up in the other half, and dare not &s;tir for fear of meeting me: Whom (that's the je&s;t of it) they have forbidden coming into their apartments, as I have them into mine. And &s;o
<PB N="343" REF="344">
I have them all pri&s;oners, while I range about as I plea&s;e. Pretty dogs and dogge&s;&s;es, to quarrel and bark at me, and yet, whenever I appear, afraid to pop out of their kennels; or if out before they &s;ee me, at the &s;ight of me run growling in again, with their flapt ears, their &s;weeping dewlaps, and their quivering tails curling inwards.</P>
<P>And here, while I am thus worthily waging war with beetles, drones, wa&s;ps, and hornets, and am all on fire with the rage of &s;lighted love, thou art regaling thy&s;elf with phlegm and rock-water, and art going on with thy re|formation-&s;cheme, and thy exultations in my misfortunes!</P>
<P>The devil take thee for an in&s;en&s;ible dough-bak'd varlet: I have no more patience with thee, than with the lady; for thou knowe&s;t nothing either of love or friend&s;hip, but art as incapable of the one, as unworthy of the other; el&s;e would&s;t thou not rejoice, as thou do&s;t under the <HI>grimace of pity,</HI> in my di&s;appointments.</P>
<P>And thou art a pretty fellow, art thou not? to engage to tran&s;cribe for her &s;ome parts of my letters written to thee in confidence? Letters that thou &s;houlde&s;t &s;ooner have parted with thy cur&s;ed tongue, than have owned thou ever had&s;t received &s;uch: Yet the&s;e are now to be communi|cated to <HI>her!</HI> But I charge thee, and woe be to thee if it be too late! that thou do not oblige her with a line of mine.</P>
<P>If thou <HI>ha&s;t</HI> done it, the lea&s;t vengeance I will take, is to break thro' <HI>my</HI> honour given to thee not to vi&s;it her, as thou wilt have broken thro' <HI>thine</HI> to me, in communicating letters written under the &s;eal of friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>I am now convinced, too &s;adly for my hopes, by her letter to my cou&s;in Charlotte, that &s;he is determined never to have me.</P>
<P><HI>Unprecedented wickedne&s;s,</HI> &s;he calls mine to her. But how does <HI>&s;he</HI> know what the ardor of flaming love will &s;timu|late? How does <HI>&s;he</HI> know the requi&s;ite di&s;tinctions of the words &s;he u&s;es in this ca&s;e?&mdash;To think the <HI>wor&s;t,</HI> and to be able to <HI>make compari&s;ons</HI> in the&s;e <HI>very</HI> delicate &s;ituations, mu&s;t &s;he not be le&s;s delicate than I had imagined her to be? &mdash;But &s;he has heard, that the devil is black; and having a mind to make one of me, brays together, in the mortar of her wild fancy, twenty chimney-&s;weepers, in order to make one &s;ootier than ordinary ri&s;e out of the dirty ma&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="345">But what a whirlwind does &s;he rai&s;e in my &s;oul, by her proud contempts of me! Never, never, was mortal man's pride &s;o mortified. How does &s;he &s;ink me, even in my own eyes! &mdash; Her heart &s;incerely repul&s;es me, &s;he &s;ays, for my MEANNESS&mdash;Yet &s;he intends to reap the benefit of what &s;he calls &s;o! &mdash; Cur&s;e upon her <HI>haughtine&s;s,</HI> and her <HI>meanne&s;s,</HI> at the &s;ame time!&mdash;Her haughtine&s;s to <HI>me,</HI> and her meanne&s;s to <HI>her own relations;</HI> more unworthy of kindred with her, than I can be, or I am <HI>mean</HI> indeed.</P>
<P>Yet who but mu&s;t admire, who but mu&s;t adore her?&mdash; O that cur&s;ed, cur&s;ed hou&s;e! But for the women of that! &mdash;Then their damn'd potions! But for <HI>tho&s;e,</HI> had her <HI>un|impaired</HI> intellects, and the <HI>maje&s;ty of her virtue,</HI> &s;aved her, as once it did by her humble eloquence <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">In the fire-&s;cene, Vol. <HI>iv.</HI> p. <HI>296.</HI></NOTE>, another time by her terrifying menaces again&s;t her own life <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Vol. <HI>v.</HI> Letter <HI>L.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Yet in both the&s;e to find her power over me, and my love for her, and to hate, to de&s;pi&s;e, and to refu&s;e me!&mdash;She might have done this with &s;ome &s;hew of ju&s;tice, had the la&s;t-intended violation been perpetrated:&mdash;But to go away conquere&s;s and triumphant in every light!&mdash;Well may &s;he de&s;pi&s;e me for &s;uffering her to do &s;o.</P>
<P>She left me <HI>low</HI> and <HI>mean</HI> indeed!&mdash;And the impre&s;&s;ion holds with her.&mdash; I could tear my fle&s;h, that I gave her not cau&s;e&mdash;that I humbled her not <HI>indeed</HI>&mdash;or that I &s;taid not in town till I could have exalted my&s;elf, by giving my&s;elf a wife &s;uperior to all trial, to all temptation.</P>
<P>I will venture one more letter to her, however; and if that don't do, or procure me an an&s;wer, then will I en|deavour to &s;ee her, let what <HI>will</HI> be the con&s;equence. If &s;he get out of my way, I will do &s;ome noble mi&s;chief to the vixen girl whom &s;he mo&s;t loves, and then quit the kingdom for ever.</P>

<P>AND &s;o you have actually delivered to the fair Implacable extracts of letters written in the confidence of friend|&s;hip! Take care&mdash;Take care, Belford&mdash;I do indeed love you better than I love any man in the world: But this is a very delicate point. The matter is grown very &s;erious to me. My heart is bent upon having her. And have her I will, tho' I marry her in the agonies of death.</P>
<P>She is very earne&s;t, you &s;ay, that I will not offer to mo|le&s;t her. <HI>That,</HI> let me tell her, will ab&s;olutely depend upon her&s;elf, and the an&s;wer &s;he returns, whether by pen and ink, or the contemptuous one of &s;ilence, which &s;he be|&s;towed upon my la&s;t four to her: And I will write it in &s;uch humble, and in &s;uch rea&s;onable terms, that, if &s;he is not a true Harlowe, &s;he <HI>&s;hall</HI> forgive me. But as to the <HI>executor&s;hip</HI> &s;he is for conferring upon thee&mdash;Thou &s;halt not be her <HI>executor:</HI> Let me peri&s;h if thou &s;halt.&mdash; Nor &s;hall &s;he die. No-body &s;hall be any-thing, no-body &s;hall <HI>dare</HI> to be any-thing, to her, but me &mdash;Thy happine&s;s is already too great, to be admitted daily to her pre&s;ence; to look upon her, to talk to her, to hear her talk, while I am forbid to come within view of her window.&mdash;What a reprobation is this, of the man who was once more dear to her than all the men in the world! &mdash; And now to be able to look down upon me, while her exalted head is hid from me among the &s;tars, &s;ometimes with low &s;corn, at other times with abject pity, I cannot bear it.</P>
<P>This I tell thee, that if I have not &s;ucce&s;s in my effort by letter, I will overcome the creeping folly that has found its way to my heart, or I will tear it out in her pre&s;ence, and throw it at hers, that &s;he may &s;ee how much more tender than her own that organ is, which &s;he, and you, and every-one el&s;e, have taken the liberty to call callous.</P>
<P>Give notice to the people who live back and edge, and on either hand, of the cur&s;ed mother, to remove their be&s;t effects, if I am rejected: For the fir&s;t vengeance I
<PB N="346" REF="347">
&s;hall take, will be to &s;et fire to that den of &s;erpents. Nor will there be any fear of taking them when they are in any act that has <HI>the reli&s;h of &s;alvation in it,</HI> as Shake&s;peare &s;ays.&mdash; So that my revenge, if they peri&s;h in the flames I &s;hall light up, will be complete, as to them.</P>

<P>LIttle as I have rea&s;on to expect either your patient ear, or forgiving heart, yet cannot I forbear to write to you once more (as a more pardonable intru&s;ion, per|haps, than a vi&s;it would be), to beg of you to put it in my power to atone, as far as it is po&s;&s;ible to atone, for the injuries I have done you.</P>
<P>Your angelic purity, and my awaken'd con&s;cience, are &s;tanding records of your exalted merit, and of my dete&s;t|able ba&s;ene&s;s: But your forgivene&s;s will lay me under an eternal obligation to you&mdash;Forgive me then, my deare&s;t life, my earthly good, the vi&s;ible anchor of my future hope! As you (who believe you have &s;omething to be for|given for) hope for pardon your&s;elf, forgive me, and con|&s;ent to meet me, upon your own conditions, and in who&s;e company you plea&s;e, at the holy altar, and to give your|&s;elf a title to the mo&s;t repentant and affectionate heart, that ever beat in a human bo&s;om.</P>
<P>But, perhaps, a time of probation may be required. It may be impo&s;&s;ible for you, as well from indi&s;po&s;ition as doubt, &s;o &s;oon to receive me to ab&s;olute favour as my heart wi&s;hes to be received. In this ca&s;e, I will &s;ubmit to your plea&s;ure; and there &s;hall be no penance which you can impo&s;e, that I will not chearfully undergo, if you will be plea&s;ed to give me hope, that, after an expiation, &s;up|po&s;e of months, wherein the regularity of my future life and actions &s;hall convince you of my reformation, you will at la&s;t be mine.</P>
<P>Let me beg the favour then of a few lines, encouraging me in this <HI>conditional</HI> hope, if it mu&s;t not be a &s;till <HI>nearer</HI> hope, and a more generous encouragement.</P>
<P>If you refu&s;e me This, you will make me de&s;perate.
<PB N="347" REF="348">
But even then I mu&s;t, at all events, throw my&s;elf at your feet, that I may not charge my&s;elf with the omi&s;&s;ion of any earne&s;t, any humble effort, to move you in my favour: For in YOU, Madam, in YOUR <HI>forgivene&s;s,</HI> are centred my hopes as to <HI>both worlds:</HI> Since to be reprobated finally by <HI>You,</HI> will leave me without expectation of mercy from <HI>Above!</HI>&mdash;For I am now awaken'd enough to think, that to be forgiven by injured innocents is <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> to the Di|vine pardon; the Almighty putting into the power of &s;uch, (as is rea&s;onable to believe) the wretch who cau&s;ele&s;ly and capitally offends them. And <HI>who</HI> can be intitled to this power, if YOU are not?</P>
<P>Your cau&s;e, Madam, in a word, I look upon to be the <HI>cau&s;e of virtue,</HI> and, as &s;uch, the <HI>cau&s;e of God.</HI> And may I not expect, that He will a&s;&s;ert it in the perdition of a man, who has acted by a per&s;on of the mo&s;t &s;potle&s;s purity, as I have done, if <HI>you,</HI> by rejecting me, &s;hew that I have offended beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of forgivene&s;s?</P>
<P>I do mo&s;t &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ure you, that no temporal or worldly views induce me to this earne&s;t addre&s;s. I de&s;erve not forgivene&s;s from <HI>you.</HI> Nor do my Lord M. and his &s;i&s;ters from <HI>me.</HI> I de&s;pi&s;e them from my heart, for pre|&s;uming to imagine, that I will be controuled by the pro|&s;pect of any benefits in their power to confer. There is not a per&s;on breathing, but your&s;elf, who &s;hall pre&s;cribe to me. Your whole conduct, Madam, has been &s;o nobly principled, and your re&s;entments are &s;o admirably ju&s;t, that you appear to me even in a divine light; and in an infinitely more amiable one at the &s;ame time, than you could have appeared in, had you not &s;uffered the barbarous wrongs, that now fill my mind with angui&s;h and horror at my own recollected villainy to the mo&s;t excellent of women.</P>
<P>I <HI>repeat,</HI> that all I beg for the pre&s;ent, is a few lines, to guide my doubtful &s;teps; and (if po&s;&s;ible for you &s;o far to conde&s;cend) to encourage me to hope, that, if I can ju&s;tify my pre&s;ent vows by my future conduct, I may be per|mitted the honour to &s;tyle my&s;elf</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Thur&s;day night, Aug.</HI> 10.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have been informed by Tourville, how much Belton's illne&s;s and affairs have engaged <HI>me,</HI> as well as Mowbray and him, &s;ince my former. I called at Smith's on Monday, in my way to Ep&s;om.</P>
<P>The lady was gone to chapel: But I had the &s;atisfaction to hear &s;he was not wor&s;e; and left my compliments, and an intimation that I &s;hould be out of town for three or four days.</P>
<P>I refer my&s;elf to Tourville, who will let you know the difficulty we had to drive out this <HI>meek</HI> mi&s;tre&s;s, and <HI>frugal</HI> manager, with her cubs, and to give the poor fellow's &s;i&s;ter po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for him of his own hou&s;e; he &s;kulking mean while at an inn at Croydon, too di&s;pirited to appear in his own cau&s;e.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that we were probably but ju&s;t in time to &s;ave the &s;hatter'd remains of his fortune from this rapacious woman, and her accomplices: For, as he cannot live long, and &s;he thinks &s;o, we found &s;he had certainly taken mea&s;ures to &s;et up a marriage, and keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all for her&s;elf and her &s;ons.</P>
<P>Tourville will tell you how I was forced to cha&s;ti&s;e the quondam ho&s;tler in her &s;ight, before I could drive him out of the hou&s;e. He had the in&s;olence to lay hands on me: And I made him take but one &s;tep from the top to the bottom of a pair of &s;tairs. I thought his neck and all his bones had been broken.

<P><PB N="350" REF="351">She &s;hould &s;oon have him, &s;he told a confident, in the &s;pace of &s;ix foot by five; meaning his bed: And then &s;he would let no-body come near him but whom &s;he plea&s;ed. The ho&s;tler-fellow, I &s;uppo&s;e, would then have been his phy&s;ician; his will ready made for him; &mdash; and widows-weeds, probably, ready provided; who knows, but to ap|pear in them in his own-&s;ight; as once I knew an in&s;tance in a wicked wife, in&s;ulting a hu&s;band &s;he hated, when &s;he thought him pa&s;t recovery: Tho' it gave the man &s;uch &s;pirits, and &s;uch a turn, that he got over it, and lived to &s;ee her in her coffin, dre&s;s'd out in the very weeds &s;he had in&s;ulted him in.</P>
<P>So much, for the pre&s;ent, for Belton, and his Thoma&s;ine.</P>
<P>I BEGIN to pity thee heartily, now I &s;ee thee in earne&s;t, in the fruitle&s;s love thou expre&s;&s;e&s;t to this angel of a lady; and the rather, as, &s;ay what thou wilt, it is impo&s;&s;ible &s;he &s;hould get over her illne&s;s, and her friends implacablene&s;s, of which &s;he has had fre&s;h in&s;tances.</P>
<P>I hope thou art not indeed di&s;plea&s;ed with the extracts I have made from thy letters for her. The letting her know the ju&s;tice thou ha&s;t done to her virtue in them, is &s;o much in favour of thy ingenuity, that I think in my heart I was right; tho' to any other woman, and to one who had not known the wor&s;t of thee that &s;he could know, it might have been wrong.</P>
<P>If the end will ju&s;tify the means, it is plain, that I have done well with regard to you both; &s;ince I have made <HI>her</HI> ea&s;ier, and <HI>you</HI> appear in a better light to her, than other|wi&s;e you would have done.</P>
<P>But if, neverthele&s;s, you are di&s;&s;atisfied with my having obliged her in a point, which I acknowlege to be delicate, let us canvas this matter at our fir&s;t meeting: And then I will &s;hew you what the extracts <HI>were,</HI> and what connexions I gave them in your favour.</P>
<P>But &s;urely thou do&s;t not pretend to &s;ay what I &s;hall, or &s;hall not do, as to the executor&s;hip.</P>
<P>I am my own man, I hope. I think thou &s;hould&s;t be glad to have the ju&s;tification of her memory left to one, who, at the &s;ame time, thou may&s;t be a&s;&s;ured, will treat thee, and thy actions, with all the lenity the ca&s;e will admit.</P>
<P><PB N="351" REF="352">I cannot help expre&s;&s;ing my &s;urprize at one in&s;tance of thy &s;elf-partiality; and that is, where thou &s;ay&s;t, She had need, indeed, to cry out for mercy her&s;elf from her friends, who knows not how to &s;hew any!</P>
<P>Surely thou can&s;t not think the ca&s;es alike!&mdash;For &s;he, as I under&s;tand, de&s;ires but a la&s;t ble&s;&s;ing, and a la&s;t for|givene&s;s, for a fault in a manner <HI>involuntary,</HI> if a fault at all; and <HI>hopes</HI> not to be <HI>received:</HI> Thou, to be forgiven <HI>premeditated</HI> wrongs (which, neverthele&s;s, &s;he forgives, on condition to be no more mole&s;ted by thee); and hope&s;t to be <HI>received into favour,</HI> and to make the fine&s;t jewel in the world thy ab&s;olute property, in con&s;equence of that for|givene&s;s.</P>
<P>I will now briefly proceed to relate what has pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince my la&s;t, as to the poor lady; by which thou wilt &s;ee, &s;he has troubles enough upon her, all &s;pringing originally from thee, without thy needing to add more to them by new vexations. And as long as thou can&s;t exert thy&s;elf &s;o very cavalierly at M. Hall, where every-one is thy pri|&s;oner, I &s;ee not but the bravery of thy &s;pirit may be as well gratified in domineering there over half a dozen per|&s;ons of rank and di&s;tinction, as it could be over a helple&s;s orphan, as I may call this lady, &s;ince &s;he has not a &s;ingle friend to &s;tand by her, if I do not; and who will think her&s;elf happy, if &s;he can refuge her&s;elf from thee, and from all the world, in the arms of death.</P>
<P>My la&s;t was dated on Saturday.</P>
<P>On Sunday, in compliance with her doctor's advice, &s;he took a little airing. Mrs. Lovick, and Mr. Smith and his wife, were with her. After being at Highgate chapel at divine &s;ervice, &s;he treated them with a little repa&s;t; and in the afternoon was at I&s;lington church, in her way home; returning tolerably chearful.</P>
<P>She had received &s;everal letters in my ab&s;ence, as Mrs. Lovick acquainted me, be&s;ides yours. Yours, it &s;eems, much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed her; but &s;he ordered the me&s;&s;enger, who pre&s;&s;ed for an an&s;wer, to be told, that it did not require an immediate one.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day &s;he received a letter from her uncle Harlowe <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Letter <HI>cix.</HI> p. <HI>337.</HI></NOTE>, in an&s;wer to one &s;he had written to her
<PB N="352" REF="353">
mother on Saturday on her knees. It mu&s;t be a very cruel one, Mrs. Lovick &s;ays, by the effects it had upon her: For, when &s;he received it, &s;he was intending to take an afternoon airing in a coach; but was thrown into &s;o vio|lent a fit of hy&s;terics upon it, that &s;he was forced to lie down; and (being not recovered thereby) to go to bed about eight o'clock.</P>
<P>On Thur&s;day morning &s;he was up very early; and had recour&s;e to the Scriptures to calm her mind, as &s;he told Mrs. Lovick: And, weak as &s;he was, would go in a chair to Lincoln's-inn chapel, about eleven. She was brought home a little better; and then &s;at down to write to her uncle. But was obliged to leave off &s;everal times&mdash;To &s;truggle, as &s;he told Mrs. Lovick, for an humble temper. <Q>My heart, &s;aid &s;he to the good woman, is a proud heart, and not yet, I find, enough mortified to my condition; but, do what I can, will be for pre&s;cribing re&s;enting things to my pen.</Q></P>
<P>I arrived in town from Belton's this Thur&s;day evening; and went directly to Smith's. She was too ill to receive my vi&s;it. But on &s;ending up my compliments, &s;he &s;ent me down word, that &s;he &s;hould be glad to &s;ee me in the morning.</P>
<P>Mrs. Lovick obliged me with the copy of a meditation collected by the lady from the Scriptures. She has intitled it, <HI>Poor mortals the cau&s;e of their own mi&s;ery;</HI> &s;o intitled, I pre&s;ume, with intention to take off the edge of her repine|ings at hard&s;hips &s;o di&s;proportioned to her fault, were her fault even as great as &s;he is inclined to think it. We may &s;ee by this, the method &s;he takes to fortify her mind, and to which &s;he owes, in a great mea&s;ure, the magnanimity with which &s;he bears her unde&s;erved per&s;ecutions.</P>

<P>MRS. Smith gave me the following particulars of a conver&s;ation that pa&s;&s;ed between her&s;elf and a young clergyman, on Tue&s;day afternoon, who, as it appears, was employed to make inquiries about the lady by her friends.</P>
<P>He came into the &s;hop in a riding-habit, and a&s;ked for &s;ome Spani&s;h &s;nuff; and finding only her&s;elf there, he de|&s;ired to have a little talk with her in the back-&s;hop.</P>
<P>He beat about the bu&s;h in &s;everal di&s;tant que&s;tions, and at la&s;t began to talk more directly about Mi&s;s Harlowe.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, He knew her before her <HI>fall</HI> (That was his im|pudent word); and gave the &s;ub&s;tance of the following account of her, as I collected it from Mrs. Smith.</P>
<P><Q>She was then, he &s;aid, the admiration and delight of every-body: He lamented, with great &s;olemnity, her <HI>back&s;liding;</HI> another of his phra&s;es. Mrs. Smith &s;aid, He was a fine &s;cholar; for he &s;poke &s;everal things &s;he under&s;tood not; and either in Latin or Greek, &s;he could not tell which; but was &s;o good as to give her the Eng|li&s;h of them without a&s;king. A fine thing, &s;he &s;aid, for a &s;cholar to be &s;o conde&s;cending!</Q></P>
<P>He &s;aid, <Q>Her going off with &s;o vile a rake had given great &s;candal and offence to all the neighbouring ladies, as well as to her friends.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="354" REF="355">He told Mrs. Smith <Q>how much &s;he u&s;ed to be followed by every-one's eye, whenever &s;he went abroad, or to church, and prai&s;ed and ble&s;&s;ed by every tongue, as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed; e&s;pecially by the poor: That &s;he gave the fa&s;hion to the fa&s;hionable, without &s;eeming her&s;elf to intend it, or to know &s;he did: That, however, it was plea&s;ant to &s;ee ladies imitate her in dre&s;s and behaviour, who, being un|able to come up to her in grace and ea&s;e, expo&s;ed but their own affectation and aukwardne&s;s, at the time that they thought them&s;elves &s;ecure of a general approbation, be|cau&s;e they wore the &s;ame things, and put them on in the &s;ame manner, that <HI>&s;he</HI> did, who had every-body's ad|miration; little con&s;idering, that were <HI>her</HI> per&s;on like <HI>theirs,</HI> or if &s;he had had <HI>their</HI> defects, &s;he would have brought up a very different fa&s;hion; for that <HI>nature</HI> was her guide in every-thing, and <HI>ea&s;e</HI> her &s;tudy; which, joined with a mingled dignity and conde&s;cen&s;ion in her air and manner, whether &s;he received or paid a compli|ment, di&s;tingui&s;hed her above all her Sex.</Q></P>
<P><Q>He &s;poke not, he &s;aid, his own &s;entiments only on this occa&s;ion, but tho&s;e of every-body: For that the prai&s;es of Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe were &s;uch a favourite topic, that a per&s;on who could not &s;peak well upon any other &s;ubject, was &s;ure to &s;peak well upon That; be|cau&s;e he could &s;ay nothing but what he had heard re|peated and applauded twenty times over.</Q></P>
<P>Hence it was, perhaps, that this gentleman accounted for the be&s;t things that he &s;aid him&s;elf; tho' I mu&s;t own that the per&s;onal knowlege of the lady which I am favoured with, made it ea&s;y to me to lick into &s;hape what the good woman reported to me, as the character given her by the young Levite: For who, even now, in her decline of health, &s;ees not that all the&s;e attributes belong to her?</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e he has not been long come from college, and now thinks he has nothing to do, but to blaze away for a &s;cholar among the <HI>ignorant;</HI> as &s;uch young fellows are apt to think tho&s;e who cannot cap ver&s;es with them, and tell us how an antient author expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in Latin on a point which, however, they may know how, as well as that author, to expre&s;s in Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>Mrs. Smith was &s;o taken with him, that &s;he would fain
<PB N="355" REF="356">
have introduced him to the lady, not que&s;tioning but it would be very acceptable to her, to &s;ee one who knew her and her friends &s;o well. But this he declined for &s;everal rea&s;ons, which he gave. One was, that per&s;ons of his cloth &s;hould be very cautious of the <HI>company they were in,</HI> e&s;pecially where <HI>Sex</HI> was concerned, and where a lady had <HI>&s;lurred her reputation</HI>&mdash;[I wi&s;h I had been there, when he gave him&s;elf the&s;e airs] Another, that he was de&s;ired to inform him&s;elf of her pre&s;ent way of life, and who her vi&s;iters were; for, as to the prai&s;es Mrs. Smith gave the lady, he hinted, that <HI>&s;he</HI> &s;eemed to be a good-natured wo|man, and might (tho' for the lady's &s;ake he hoped not) be too partial and &s;hort-&s;ighted to be tru&s;ted to, ab&s;olutely, in a concern of &s;o high a nature as he intimated the ta&s;k was which he had undertaken; nodding out words of doubtful import, and a&s;&s;uming airs of great &s;ignificance, (as I could gather) throughout the whole conver&s;ation. And when Mrs. Smith told him, that the lady was in a very bad &s;tate of health, he gave a carele&s;s &s;hrug&mdash;She may be very ill, &s;ays he: Her di&s;appointments mu&s;t have touch'd her to the quick: But &s;he is not bad enough, I dare &s;ay, yet, to atone for her very great lap&s;e, and to expect to be for|given by tho&s;e whom &s;he has &s;o much di&s;graced.</P>
<P>A &s;tarch'd conceited novice! What would I give he had fallen in my way?</P>
<P>He went away highly &s;atisfied with him&s;elf, no doubt, and a&s;&s;ured of Mrs. Smith's great opinion of his &s;agacity and learning: But bid her not &s;ay any-thing to the lady about him, or his inquiries. And I, for very different rea&s;ons, injoined the &s;ame thing.</P>
<P>I am glad, however, for her peace of mind's &s;ake, that they begin to think it behoves them to inquire about her.</P>

<P>I could not look forward to my la&s;t &s;cene with comfort, without &s;eeking, at lea&s;t, to obtain the ble&s;&s;ing I petitioned for; and that with a contrition &s;o deep, that I de&s;erved not, were it known, to be turned over from the tender nature of a mother, to the upbraiding pen of an uncle; and to be wounded by a cruel que&s;tion, put by him in a &s;hocking manner; and which a little, a very little time, will better an&s;wer than I can: For I am not either a harden'd or &s;hame|le&s;s creature: If I were, I &s;hould not have been &s;o &s;olici|tous to obtain the favour I &s;ued for.</P>

<P>I &s;hould &s;till be glad to have theirs, and yours, Sir, and all your ble&s;&s;ings, and your prayers: But, denied in &s;uch a manner, I will not pre&s;ume again to a&s;k it: Relying intirely on the Almighty's; which is never denied, when &s;upplicated for with &s;uch true penitence, as I hope mine is.</P>

<P>AS your uncle Harlowe choo&s;es not to an&s;wer your pert letter to him; and as mine written to you be|fore
<PB N="362" REF="363"><NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> I. <HI>p.</HI> 214.</NOTE> was written as if it were in the &s;pirit of prophecy, as you have found to your &s;orrow; and as you are now making your&s;elf wor&s;e than you are in your health, and better than you are in your penitence, <HI>as we are very well a&s;&s;ured,</HI> in order to move compa&s;&s;ion; which you do not de&s;erve, having had &s;o much warning: For all the&s;e rea|&s;ons, I take up my pen once more; tho' I had told your <HI>brother, at his going to Edinburgh,</HI> that I would not write to you, even were you to write to me, without letting him know. So indeed <HI>had we all;</HI> for he progno&s;ticated what would happen, as to your applying to us, when you knew not how to help it.</P>
<P>Brother John has hurt your nicene&s;s, it &s;eems, by a&s;k|ing you a plain que&s;tion, which your mother's heart is too full of grief to let her a&s;k; and mode&s;ty will not let your &s;i&s;ter a&s;k, tho' but the con&s;equence of your actions&mdash;And yet it <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be an&s;wered, before you'll obtain from your father and mother, and us, the notice you hope for, I can tell you that.</P>
<P>You lived &s;everal guilty weeks with one of the vile&s;t fellows that ever drew breath, at bed as well as board, no doubt (for is not his character known?); and pray don't be a&s;hamed to be a&s;ked after what may naturally come of &s;uch free living. This mode&s;ty, indeed, would have be|come you for eighteen years of your life&mdash;You'll be plea|&s;ed to mark that &mdash; but makes no good figure compared with your behaviour &s;ince the beginning of April la&s;t. So pray don't take it up, and wipe your mouth upon it, as if nothing had happened.</P>
<P>But, may be, I likewi&s;e am too &s;hocking to your nice|ne&s;s!&mdash;Oh, girl, girl! your mode&s;ty had better been &s;hewn at the right time and place! &mdash; Every-body, but you, be|lieved what the Rake was: But you would believe nothing bad of him&mdash;What think you now?</P>
<P>Your folly has ruined all our peace. And who knows where it may yet end? &mdash; Your poor father but ye&s;terday &s;hewed me this text: With bitter grief he &s;hewed it me, poor man! And do you lay it to your heart:</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Sunday, Aug.</HI> 13.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Honoured Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM very &s;orry for my pert letter to my uncle Har|lowe. Yet I did not intend it to be pert. People <HI>new</HI> to misfortune may be too ea&s;ily moved to impatience.</P>
<P>The fall of a regular per&s;on, no doubt, is dreadful and inexcu&s;able. It is like the &s;in of apo&s;ta&s;y. Would to Hea|ven,
<PB N="364" REF="365">
however, that I had had the circum&s;tances of mine inquired into!</P>
<P>If, Sir, I make my&s;elf wor&s;e than I am in my health, and better than I am in my penitence, it is fit I &s;hould be puni&s;hed for my double di&s;&s;imulation: And <HI>you</HI> have the plea&s;ure of being one of my puni&s;hers. My &s;incerity in both re&s;pects will, however, be be&s;t ju&s;tified by the event. To <HI>that</HI> I refer.&mdash;May Heaven give you always as much comfort in reflecting upon the reprobation I have met with, as you &s;eem to have plea&s;ure in mortifying a poor creature, <HI>extremely</HI> mortified; and that from a <HI>right</HI> &s;en&s;e, as &s;he pre&s;umes to hope, of her own fault!</P>
<P>What you have <HI>heard of me</HI> I cannot tell. When the neare&s;t and deare&s;t relations give up an unhappy wretch, it is not to be wondered at, that tho&s;e who are <HI>not</HI> related to her are ready to take up and propagate &s;landers again&s;t her. Yet I think I may defy calumny it&s;elf, and (ex|cepting the fatal, tho' involuntary &s;tep of <HI>April</HI> 10.) wrap my&s;elf in my own innocence, and be ea&s;y. I thank you, Sir, neverthele&s;s, for your <HI>caution,</HI> mean it what it will.</P>
<P>As to the que&s;tion required of me to an&s;wer, and which is allowed to be too &s;hocking either for a mother to put to a daughter, or a &s;i&s;ter to a &s;i&s;ter; and which, however, <HI>you</HI> &s;ay, I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> an&s;wer.&mdash;O Sir!&mdash;And <HI>mu&s;t</HI> I an&s;wer?&mdash;This then be my an&s;wer:&mdash;<Q>A <HI>little</HI> time, a much <HI>le&s;s</HI> time than is imagined, will afford a more &s;atisfactory an&s;wer to my whole family, and even to my <HI>brother</HI> and <HI>&s;i&s;ter,</HI> than I can give in words.</Q></P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, be plea&s;ed to let it be remembred, that I did not petition for a re&s;toration to favour. I could not hope for that. Nor yet to be put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any part of my own e&s;tate. Nor even for means of nece&s;&s;ary &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence from the produce of that e&s;tate&mdash;But only for a ble&s;&s;|ing; for a <HI>la&s;t</HI> ble&s;&s;ing!</P>
<P>And this I will further add, becau&s;e it is <HI>true,</HI> that I have no wilful crime to charge again&s;t my&s;elf: No free living at bed and at board, as you phra&s;e it!</P>
<P>Why, why, Sir, were not other inquiries made of me, as well as this &s;hocking one?&mdash;Inquiries that mode&s;ty <HI>would</HI> have permitted a mother or a &s;i&s;ter to make; and which, if I
<PB N="365" REF="366">
may be excu&s;ed to &s;ay &s;o, would have been &s;till <HI>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s</HI> impro|per, and <HI>more</HI> charitable, to have been made by <HI>uncles</HI> (were the mother <HI>forbid,</HI> or the &s;i&s;ter <HI>not inclined,</HI> to make them), than tho&s;e they have made.</P>
<P>Altho' my humble application has brought upon me &s;o much &s;evere reproach, I repent not that I have written to my mamma (altho' I cannot but wi&s;h that I had not written to my &s;i&s;ter); becau&s;e I have &s;atisfied a dutiful con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s by it, however unan&s;wered by the wi&s;hed-for &s;ucce&s;s. Ne|verthele&s;s, I cannot help &s;aying, that mine is indeed a hard fate, that I cannot beg pardon for my capital error, without doing it in &s;uch terms, as &s;hall be an aggravation of the offence.</P>
<P>But I had be&s;t leave off, le&s;t, as my full mind, I find, is ri&s;ing to my pen, I have other pardons to beg, as I mul|tiply lines, where none at all will be given.</P>
<P>God Almighty ble&s;s, pre&s;erve, and comfort my dear &s;orrowing and grievou&s;ly offended father and mother!&mdash;And continue in honour, favour, and merit, my happy &s;i&s;ter! &mdash; May God forgive my brother, and protect him from the violence of his own temper, as well as from the de&s;troyer of his &s;i&s;ter's honour!&mdash;And may you, my dear uncle, and your no le&s;s now than ever dear brother, my &s;econd papa, as he u&s;ed to bid me call him, be ble&s;&s;ed and happy in them all, and in each other!&mdash;And, in order to this, may you all &s;peedily bani&s;h from your remembrance for ever,</P>

<P>ALL your friends here, my dear young Lady, now &s;eem &s;et upon propo&s;ing to you to go to one of the Plantations. This, I believe, is owing to &s;ome mi&s;repre|&s;entations of Mr. Brand; from whom they have received a letter.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h with all my heart, that you could, con&s;i&s;tently with your own notions of honour, yield to the pre&s;&s;ing reque&s;ts of all Mr. Lovelace's family in his behalf. This,
<PB N="366" REF="367">
I think, would &s;top every mouth; and, in time, recon|cile every-body to you. For your own friends will not believe that he is in earne&s;t to marry you; and the hatred between the families is &s;uch, that they will not conde&s;cend to inform them&s;elves better; nor would believe <HI>him,</HI> if he were ever &s;o &s;olemnly to avow that he is.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be very glad to have in readine&s;s, upon occa|&s;ion, &s;ome brief particulars of your &s;ad &s;tory under your own hand. But, let me tell you, at the &s;ame time, that no mi&s;repre&s;entations, nor even your own confe&s;&s;ion, &s;hall le&s;&s;en my opinion, either of your piety, or of your pru|dence in e&s;&s;ential points; becau&s;e I know it was always your humble way to make light faults heavy again&s;t your|&s;elf: And well might you, my deare&s;t young Lady, ag|gravate your own failings, who have ever had &s;o few; and tho&s;e few &s;o &s;light, that your ingenuity has turned mo&s;t of them into excellencies.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, let me advi&s;e you, my dear Mi&s;s Clary, to di&s;countenance any vi&s;its, that may, with the cen&s;o|rious, affect your character. As <HI>that</HI> has not hitherto &s;uf|fered by your <HI>wilful</HI> default, I hope you will not, in a de&s;ponding negligence (&s;atisfying your&s;elf with a con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s of your own innocence), permit it to &s;uffer. Dif|ficult &s;ituations, you know, my dear young Lady, are the te&s;ts not only of prudence, but of virtue.</P>
<P>I think, I mu&s;t own to you, that, &s;ince Mr. Brand's letter has been received, I have a renewed prohibition to attend you. However, if you will give me leave, that &s;hall not detain me from you. Nor would I &s;tay for that leave, if I were not in hopes, that, in this critical &s;itua|tion, I may be able to do you &s;ervice here.</P>
<P>I have often had me&s;&s;ages and inquiries after your health, from the truly reverend Dr. Lewen, who has always ex|pre&s;&s;ed, and &s;till expre&s;&s;es, infinite concern for you. He intirely di&s;approves of the mea&s;ures of the family, with regard to you. He is too much indi&s;po&s;ed to go abroad. But, were he in good health, he would not, as I under|&s;tand, vi&s;it at Harlowe-Place; having been unhand&s;omely treated, &s;ome time ago, by your brother, on his offering to mediate between your family and you.</P>
<P><PB N="367" REF="368">I AM ju&s;t now informed, that your cou&s;in Morden is arrived in England. He is at Canterbury, it &s;eems, look|ing after &s;ome concerns he has there; and is &s;oon expected in the&s;e parts. Who knows what may ari&s;e from his ar|rival?&mdash;God be with you, my deare&s;t Mi&s;s Clary, and be your Comforter and Su&s;tainer. And never fear but he will; for I am &s;ure, I am very &s;ure, that you put your whole tru&s;t in Him.</P>
<P>And what, after all, is this world, on which we &s;o much depend for durable good, poor creatures that we are!&mdash;When all the joys of it, and (what is a balancing com|fort) all the <HI>troubles</HI> of it, are but momentary, and vani&s;h like a morning dream?</P>
<P>And be this remembred, my deare&s;t young Lady, that worldly joy claims no kindred with the joys we are bid to a&s;pire after. The&s;e latter we mu&s;t be fitted for by afflic|tion and di&s;appointment. You are therefore in the direct road to glory, however thorny the path you are in. And I had almo&s;t &s;aid, that it depends upon your&s;elf, by your patience, and by your re&s;ignedne&s;s to the di&s;pen&s;ation (God enabling you, who never fails the true penitent, and &s;incere invoker), to be an heir of a ble&s;&s;ed immortality.</P>
<P>But this glory, I humbly pray, that you may not be permitted to enter into, ripe as you are &s;o &s;oon likely to be for it, till with your gentle hand (a plea&s;ure I have &s;o often, as you know, promi&s;ed to my&s;elf) you have clo&s;ed the eyes of</P>

From the&s;e you will be able to collect a great deal of my &s;tory. But for what is previous to the&s;e papers, and which more particularly relates to what I have &s;uffered from Mr. Lovelace, you mu&s;t have patience; for at pre&s;ent I have neither head nor heart for &s;uch &s;ubjects. The papers I &s;end you with this will be tho&s;e mentioned in the margin <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><LIST>

<P>The&s;e communications you mu&s;t not, my good Mrs.
<PB N="369" REF="370">
Norton, look upon as appeals again&s;t my relations. On the contrary, I am heartily &s;orry, that they have incurred the di&s;plea&s;ure of &s;o excellent a divine as Dr. Lewen. But you de&s;ire to have every-thing before you; and I think you <HI>ought;</HI> for who knows, as you &s;ay, but you may be applied to at la&s;t, to admini&s;ter comfort from their con|ceding hearts, to one that wants it; and who &s;ometimes, judging by what &s;he knows of her own heart, thinks her|&s;elf intitled to it?</P>
<P>I know, that I have a mo&s;t indulgent and &s;weet-tem|pered mother; but, having to deal with violent &s;pirits, &s;he has too often forfeited that peace of mind, which &s;he &s;o much prefers, by her over-concern to pre&s;erve it.</P>
<P>I am &s;ure &s;he would not have turned me over for an an|&s;wer to a letter written with &s;o contrite and fervent a &s;pirit, as was mine to her, to a <HI>manly</HI> &s;pirit, had &s;he been left to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>But, my dear Mrs. Norton, might not, think you, the revered lady have favoured me with one <HI>private</HI> line?&mdash;If not, might not &s;he have permitted <HI>you</HI> to have written by her order, or connivance, one &s;oftening, one <HI>motherly</HI> line, when &s;he &s;aw her poor girl borne &s;o hard upon?</P>
<P>O no, &s;he might not!&mdash;Becau&s;e her heart, to be &s;ure, is in their mea&s;ures!&mdash;And if <HI>&s;he</HI> think them right, perhaps they <HI>mu&s;t be right!</HI> &mdash; At lea&s;t knowing only what <HI>they</HI> know!&mdash;And yet they <HI>might</HI> know all, if they would! &mdash; And po&s;&s;ibly, in their own good time, they think to make proper inquiry. &mdash; My application was made to them but <HI>lately</HI> &mdash; Yet how grievous will it be to their hearts, if <HI>their</HI> time &s;hould be <HI>out of time!</HI></P>
<P>By the letters I have &s;ent to Mi&s;s Howe, you will &s;ee, when you have them before you, that Lord M. and the Ladies of his family, jealous as they are of the honour of <HI>their hou&s;e</HI> (to expre&s;s my&s;elf in their language), think bet|ter of me than my own relations do. You will &s;ee an in|&s;tance of their genero&s;ity to me, which has extremely af|fected me.</P>
<P>Some of the letters in the &s;ame pacquet will al&s;o let you into the knowlege of a &s;trange &s;tep which I have taken (&s;trange you will think it); and, at the &s;ame time, give you my rea&s;ons for it <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">She means that of making Mr. Belford her Executor.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="370" REF="371">It mu&s;t be expected, that &s;ituations uncommonly difficult will make nece&s;&s;ary &s;ome extraordinary &s;teps, which but for tho&s;e &s;ituations would be hardly excu&s;eable. It will be very happy indeed, and &s;omewhat wonderful, if all the mea&s;ures I have been driven to take &s;hould be right. A pure intention, void of all undutiful re&s;entment, is what mu&s;t be my con&s;olation, whatever others may think of tho&s;e mea&s;ures, when they come to know them: Which, however, will hardly be till it is out of my power to ju&s;tify them, or to an&s;wer for my&s;elf.</P>

<P>But when I am no more, get over, I charge you, as &s;oon as you can, the &s;marting pangs of grief that will attend a recent lo&s;s; and let all be early turned into that &s;weetly-melancholy Regard to MEMORY, which, engaging us to forget all faults, and to remember nothing but what was thought amiable, gives more plea&s;ure than pain to &s;urvi|vors &mdash; E&s;pecially if they can comfort them&s;elves with the humble hope, that the Divine mercy has taken the dear de|parted to it&s;elf.</P>

<P>I Don't know what a devil ails me; but I never was &s;o much indi&s;po&s;ed in my life. At fir&s;t, I thought &s;ome of my ble&s;&s;ed relations here had got a do&s;e admini&s;tred to me, in order to get the whole hou&s;e to them&s;elves. But as I am the hopes of the family, I believe they would not be &s;o wicked.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t lay down my pen. I cannot write with any &s;pirit at all. What a plague can be the matter with me!</P>
<P>LORD M. paid me ju&s;t now a cur&s;ed gloomy vi&s;it, to a&s;k how I do after bleeding. His &s;i&s;ters both drove away ye&s;terday, God be thanked. But they a&s;ked not my leave; and hardly bid me good-bye. My Lord was more tender, and more dutiful than I expected. Men are le&s;s unforgiving than women. I have rea&s;on to &s;ay &s;o, I am &s;ure. For, be&s;ides implacable Mi&s;s Harlowe, and the old Ladies, the two Montague Apes han't been near me yet.</P>
<P>NEITHER eat, drink, nor &s;leep!&mdash;A piteous ca&s;e, Jack! If I &s;hould die like a fool now, people would &s;ay Mi&s;s Harlowe had broke my heart.&mdash;That &s;he <HI>vexes</HI> me to the heart, is certain.</P>
<P>Confounded &s;queami&s;h! I would fain write it off. But mu&s;t lay down my pen again. It won't do. Poor Love|lace!&mdash;What a devil ails thee?</P>
<P>WELL, but now let's try for't&mdash;Hoy&mdash;Hoy&mdash;Hoy! Con|found me for a gaping puppy, how I yawn!&mdash;Where &s;hall
<PB N="372" REF="373">
I begin? At thy Executor&s;hip?&mdash;Thou &s;halt have a double office of it: For I really think thou may&s;t &s;end me a coffin and a &s;hroud. I &s;hall be ready for them by the time they can come down.</P>
<P>What a little fool is this Mi&s;s Harlowe! I warrant &s;he'll now repent that &s;he refu&s;ed me. Such a lovely young widow&mdash;What a charming widow would &s;he have made! How would &s;he have adorned the weeds! To be a widow in the fir&s;t twelvemonth is one of the greate&s;t felicities that can befall a fine lady. Such pretty employment in <HI>new di&s;mals,</HI> when &s;he had hardly worn round her <HI>blazing joy|fuls!</HI> Such lights, and &s;uch &s;hades! how would they &s;et off one another, and be adorned by the wearer!&mdash;</P>
<P>Go to the devil!&mdash;I <HI>will</HI> write!&mdash;Can I do any-thing el&s;e?</P>
<P>They would not have me write, Belford.&mdash;I mu&s;t be ill indeed, when I can't write.&mdash;</P>
<P>BUT thou &s;eeme&s;t nettled, Jack! Is it becau&s;e I was &s;tung? It is not for two friends, any more than for man and wife, to be out of patience at one time. &mdash; What mu&s;t be the con&s;equence, if they are?&mdash;I am in no fighting mood ju&s;t now: But as patient and pa&s;&s;ive as the chickens that are brought me in broth&mdash;For I am come to that already.</P>
<P>But I can tell thee, for all this, be <HI>thy own man,</HI> if thou wilt, as to the Executor&s;hip, I will never &s;uffer thee to ex|po&s;e my letters. They are too ingenuous by half to be &s;een. And I ab&s;olutely in&s;i&s;t upon it, that, on receipt of this, thou burn them all.</P>
<P>I will never forgive thee that impudent and unfriendly reflection, of my <HI>cavaliering</HI> it here over half a dozen per|&s;ons of di&s;tinction: Remember, too, thy poor <HI>helple&s;s or|phan</HI>&mdash;The&s;e reflections are too &s;erious; and thou art al&s;o too &s;erious, for me to let the&s;e things go off as je&s;ting; not|with&s;tanding the Roman &s;tile is pre&s;erved; and, indeed, but ju&s;t pre&s;erved. By my &s;oul, Jack, if I had not been taken thus egregiou&s;ly crop&s;ick, I would have been up with thee, and the lady too, before now.</P>
<P>But write on, however: And &s;end me copies, if thou can&s;t, of all that pa&s;&s;es between our Charlotte and Mi&s;s Harlowe. I'll take no notice of what thou communicate&s;t of that &s;ort. I like not the people here the wor&s;e for their
<PB N="373" REF="374">
generous offer to the lady. But you &s;ee &s;he is as proud as implacable. There's no obliging her. She'd rather &s;ell her cloaths, than be beholden to any-body, altho' &s;he would oblige by permitting the obligation.</P>
<P>Oh Lord! Oh Lord!&mdash;Mortal ill&mdash;Adieu, Jack!</P>
<P>I WAS forced to leave off, I was &s;o ill, at this place. And what do&s;t think? My uncle brought the par&s;on of the pari&s;h to pray by me; for his chaplain is at Oxford. I was lain down in my night-gown over my wai&s;tcoat, and in a doze: And, when I open'd my eyes, who &s;hould I &s;ee, but the par&s;on kneeling on one &s;ide the bed; Lord M. on the other; Mrs. Greme, who had been &s;ent for to <HI>tend me,</HI> as they call it, at the feet: God be thanked, my Lord, &s;aid I, in an ec&s;ta&s;y!&mdash;Where's Mi&s;s? &mdash; For I thought they were going to marry me.</P>
<P>They thought me delirious, at fir&s;t, and pray'd louder and louder.</P>
<P>This rou&s;ed me: Off the bed I &s;tarted; &s;lid my feet into my &s;lippers; put my hand in my wai&s;tcoat pocket, and pulled out thy letter with my Beloved's meditations in it: My Lord, Dr. Wright, Mrs. Greme, you have thought me a very wicked fellow: But, &s;ee! I can read you as good as you can read me.</P>
<P>They &s;tared at one another. I gaped, and read, Poor mo&mdash;or&mdash;tals the cau&mdash;o&mdash;au&s;e of their own &mdash; their own mi&s;&mdash;&s;er&mdash;ry.</P>
<P>It is as &s;uitable to my ca&s;e, as to the lady's, as thou'lt ob|&s;erve, if thou reade&s;t it again <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See p. <HI>352.</HI></NOTE>. At the pa&s;&s;age where it is &s;aid, That when a man is cha&s;tened for &s;in, his beauty con&s;umes away, I &s;tept to the gla&s;s: A poor figure, by Jupiter, cried I!&mdash;And they all prai&s;ed and admired me; lifted up their hands and their eyes; and the Doctor &s;aid, He always thought it impo&s;&s;ible, that a man of my &s;en&s;e could be &s;o wild as the world &s;aid I was. My Lord chuckled for joy; congratulated me; and, thank my dear Mi&s;s Harlowe, I got high reputation among good, bad, and indifferent. In &s;hort, I have e&s;tabli&s;hed my&s;elf for ever with all here.&mdash;But, O Belford, even this will not do!&mdash;I mu&s;t leave off again.</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="375">A VISIT from the Montague &s;i&s;ters, led in by my hob|ling uncle, to congratulate my amendment and reforma|tion both in one. What a lucky event this illne&s;s, with this meditation in my pocket; for we were all to pieces before! Thus, when a boy, have I joined with a croud coming out of church, and have been thought to have been there my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I am incen&s;ed at the in&s;olence of the young Levite. Thou wilt highly oblige me, if thou'lt find him out, and &s;end me his ears in the next letter.</P>
<P>My charmer mi&s;takes me, if &s;he thinks I propo&s;ed her writing to me, as an alternative that &s;hould di&s;pen&s;e with my attendance upon her. That it &s;hall <HI>not</HI> do, nor did I intend it &s;hould, unle&s;s &s;he had plea&s;ed me better in the contents of it than &s;he has done. Bid her read again. I gave no &s;uch hopes. I would have been with her in &s;pite of you both, by to-morrow, at farthe&s;t, had I not been laid by the heels thus, like a helple&s;s mi&s;creant.</P>
<P>But I grow better and better every hour, <HI>I</HI> &s;ay: The <HI>Doctor</HI> &s;ays not: But I am &s;ure I know be&s;t: And I will &s;oon be in London, depend on't. But &s;ay nothing of this to my dear, cruel, and implacable Mi&s;s Harlowe.</P>

<P>I Am &s;incerely rejoiced to hear that thou art already &s;o much amended, as thy &s;ervant tells me thou art. Thy letter looks as if thy morals were mending with thy health. This was a letter I <HI>could</HI> &s;hew, as I <HI>did,</HI> to the lady.</P>

<P><PB N="377" REF="378">No goodne&s;s in it! &s;he &s;aid&mdash;It was a frame of mind &s;he had endeavoured after for her own &s;ake.

<P>She was &s;o ill, that this was all that pa&s;&s;ed on the occa|&s;ion.</P>
<P>What a fine &s;ubject for Tragedy would the injuries of this lady, and her behaviour under them, both with regard to her implacable friends, and to her per&s;ecutor, make! With a grand objection as to the moral, neverthele&s;s <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Mr. Belford's objection&punc; That virtue ought not to &s;uffer in a Tragedy, is not well con&s;idered: Monimia in the Orphan, Belvidera in Venice Pre&s;erv'd, Athenais in Theodo&s;ius, Cordelia in Shake&s;peare's King Lear, De&s;demona in Othello, Hamlet, to name no more, are in&s;tances, that a Tragedy could hardly be ju&s;tly called a Tragedy, if virtue did not tempo|rarily &s;uffer, and vice for a while triumph. But he recovers him&s;elf in the &s;ame paragraph; and leads us to look up to the FUTURE for the Reward of Virtue, and for the Puni&s;hment of Guilt: And ob&s;erves not ami&s;s, when he &s;ays, He knows not but that the virtue of &s;uch a wo|man as Clari&s;&s;a is rewarded in mi&s;&s;ing &s;uch a man as Lovelace.</NOTE>; for here virtue is puni&s;hed!

Yet, after all, I know not, &s;o &s;ad a fellow art thou, and &s;o vile an hu&s;band mighte&s;t thou have made, whether her virtue is not rewarded in mi&s;&s;ing thee: For things the mo&s;t grievous to human na|ture, when they happen, as this charming creature once ob&s;erved, are often the happie&s;t for us in the event.</P>
<P>I have frequently thought, in my attendance on this lady, That if Belton's admired author, Nic. Rowe, had had &s;uch a character before him, he would have drawn another &s;ort of a penitent than he <HI>has</HI> done, or given his Play, which he calls <HI>The Fair Penitent,</HI> a fitter title. Mi&s;s Harlowe is a penitent indeed! I think, if I am not guilty of a contradiction in terms, a penitent without a fault; her parents conduct towards her from the fir&s;t con&s;idered.</P>
<P>The whole &s;tory of the other is a pack of damn'd &s;tuff. Lothario, 'tis true, &s;eems &s;uch another wicked ungenerous varlet as thou know'&s;t who: The author knew how to draw a Rake; but not to paint a Penitent. Cali&s;ta is a de|&s;iring lu&s;cious wench, and her penitence is nothing el&s;e
<PB N="378" REF="379">
but rage, in&s;olence, and &s;corn. Her pa&s;&s;ions are all &s;torm and tumult; nothing of the finer pa&s;&s;ions of the Sex, which, if naturally drawn, will di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves from the ma&s;culine pa&s;&s;ions, by a &s;oftne&s;s that will even mine thro' rage and de&s;pair. Her character is made up of deceit and di&s;gui&s;e. She has no virtue; is all pride; and her devil is as much <HI>within</HI> her, as <HI>without</HI> her.</P>
<P>How then can the fall of &s;uch a one create a proper di&s;tre&s;s, when all the circum&s;tances of it are con&s;idered? For does &s;he not brazen out her crime, even after detection? Knowing her own guilt, &s;he calls for Altamont's vengeance on his be&s;t friend, as if he had traduced her; yields to marry Altamont, tho' criminal with another; and actually beds that whining puppy, when &s;he had given up her&s;elf body and &s;oul to Lothario; who, neverthele&s;s, refu&s;ed to marry her.</P>
<P>Her penitence, when begun, &s;he ju&s;tly &s;tiles <HI>The phren&s;y of her &s;oul;</HI> and, as I &s;aid, after having, as long as &s;he could, mo&s;t audaciou&s;ly brazened out her crime, and done all the mi&s;chief &s;he could do (occa&s;ioning the death of Lo|thario, of her father, and others), &s;he &s;tabs her&s;elf.</P>
<P>And can this be an act of penitence?</P>
<P>But, indeed, our poets hardly know how to create a di|&s;tre&s;s without horror and murder; and mu&s;t &s;hock your &s;oul, to bring tears from your eyes.</P>
<P>Altamont indeed, who is an amorous blockhead, a cre|dulous cuckold, and (tho' painted as a brave fellow, and a &s;oldier)&mdash;a whining Tom E&s;&s;ence, and a quarreller with his be&s;t friend, dies like a fool, without &s;word or pop-gun, of mere grief and non&s;en&s;e, for one of the vile&s;t of her &s;ex: But the <HI>Fair Penitent,</HI> as &s;he is called, dies by her own hand; and, having no title by her pa&s;t crimes to <HI>laud|able</HI> pity, forfeits all claim to <HI>true</HI> penitence, and, in all probability, to future mercy.</P>
<P>But here is MISS HARLOWE, virtuous, noble, wi&s;e, pious, unhappily in&s;nared by the vows and oaths of a vile Rake, whom &s;he believes to be a man of honour: And, being ill u&s;ed by her friends for <HI>his &s;ake,</HI> is in a manner <HI>forced</HI> to throw her&s;elf upon his protection; who, in order to obtain her confidence, never &s;cruples the deepe&s;t and mo&s;t &s;olemn prote&s;tations of honour. After a &s;eries of plots
<PB N="379" REF="380">
and contrivances, all baffled by her virtue and vigilance, he ba&s;ely has recour&s;e to the vile&s;t of arts, and, to rob her of her honour, is forced fir&s;t to rob her of her &s;en&s;es. Un|able to bring her, notwith&s;tanding, to his ungenerous views of cohabitation, &s;he awes him in the very entrance of a fre&s;h act of premeditated guilt, in pre&s;ence of the mo&s;t abandoned of women, a&s;&s;embled to a&s;&s;i&s;t his cur&s;ed pur|po&s;e; triumphs over them all, by virtue only of her inno|cence; and e&s;capes from the vile hands he had put her into: Nobly, not franticly, re&s;ents: Refu&s;es to &s;ee, or to marry the wretch; who, repenting his u&s;age of &s;o divine a crea|ture, would fain move her to forgive his ba&s;ene&s;s, and make him her hu&s;band: And, tho' per&s;ecuted by all her friends, and abandoned to the deepe&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, obliged, from ample fortunes, to make away with her apparel for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, &s;urrounded by &s;trangers, and forced (in want of others) to make a friend of the friend of her &s;educer. Tho' longing for death, and making all the proper pre|paratives for it, convinced that grief and ill u&s;age have broken her noble heart, &s;he abhors the impious thought of &s;hortening her allotted period; and, as much a &s;tranger to revenge as de&s;pair, is able to forgive the author of her ruin; wi&s;hes his repentance, and that &s;he may be the la&s;t victim to his barbarous perfidy: And is &s;olicitous for no|thing &s;o much in this life, as to prevent vindictive mi&s;chief <HI>to</HI> and <HI>from</HI> the man, who has u&s;ed her &s;o ba&s;ely.</P>
<P>This is penitence! This is piety! And hence a di&s;tre&s;s naturally ari&s;es, that mu&s;t <HI>worthily</HI> affect every heart.</P>
<P>Whatever the ill-u&s;age of this excellent lady is from her relations, it breaks not out into exce&s;&s;es: She &s;trives, on the contrary, to find rea&s;on to ju&s;tify them at her own ex|pence; and &s;eems more concerned for their cruelty to her for their &s;akes hereafter, when &s;he &s;hall be no more, than for her own: For, as to her&s;elf, &s;he is &s;ure, &s;he &s;ays, God will forgive her, tho' no-body el&s;e will.</P>
<P>On every extraordinary provocation &s;he has recour&s;e to the Scriptures, and endeavours to regulate her vehemence by &s;acred precedents. Better people, &s;he &s;ays, have been more afflicted than &s;he, grievous as &s;he &s;ometimes thinks her afflictions: And &s;hall &s;he not bear what le&s;s faulty per&s;ons have born?

<SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Think my&s;elf obliged in honour to acquaint you, that I am afraid Mr. Lovelace will try his fate by an inter|view with you.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h to Heaven you could prevail upon your&s;elf to re|ceive his vi&s;it. All that is re&s;pectful, even to veneration, and all that is penitent, will you &s;ee in his behaviour, if you can admit of it. But as I am obliged to &s;et out di|rectly for Ep&s;om (to perform, as I apprehend, the la&s;t friendly offices for poor Mr. Belton, whom once you &s;aw) and as I think it more likely, that Mr. Lovelace will <HI>not</HI> be prevailed upon, than that he <HI>will,</HI> I thought fit to give you this intimation, le&s;t otherwi&s;e, if he &s;hould come, you &s;hould be too much &s;urpri&s;ed.</P>
<P>He flatters him&s;elf, that you are not &s;o ill as I repre&s;ent you to be. When he &s;ees you, he will be convinced, that the mo&s;t obliging things he can do, will be as proper to be done for the &s;ake of his own future peace of mind, as for your health-&s;ake; and, I dare &s;ay, in fear of hurt|ing the latter, he will forbear the thoughts of any further intru&s;ion; at lea&s;t while you are &s;o much indi&s;po&s;ed: So that <HI>one half-hour's &s;hock,</HI> if it <HI>will</HI> be a &s;hock to &s;ee the unhappy man (but ju&s;t got up him&s;elf from a dangerous fever), will be all you will have occa&s;ion to &s;tand.</P>

<P>WHAT an unmerciful fellow art thou! A man has no need of a con&s;cience, who has &s;uch an imper|tinent monitor. But if Nic. Rowe wrote a Play that an&s;wers not his title, am I to be reflected upon for that?&mdash;I have &s;inned! I repent! I would repair!&mdash;She for|gives my &s;in! She accepts my repentance! But &s;he won't let me repair!&mdash;What would&s;t have me do?</P>
<P>But get thee gone to Belton, as &s;oon as thou can&s;t. Yet whether thou goe&s;t or not, up I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> go, and &s;ee what I can do with the &s;weet oddity my&s;elf. The moment the&s;e <HI>pre&s;cribing</HI> varlets will let me, depend upon it, I go. Nay, Lord M. thinks &s;he ought to permit me one interview. His opinion has great authority with me&mdash;when it &s;quares with my own: And I have a&s;&s;ured him, and my two cou|&s;ins, that I will behave with all the decency and re&s;pect, that man can behave with to the per&s;on whom he <HI>mo&s;t</HI> re|&s;pects. And &s;o I will. Of this, if thou choo&s;e&s;t not to go to Belton mean time, thou &s;halt be witne&s;s.</P>
<P>Colonel Morden, thou ha&s;t heard me &s;ay, is a man of honour and bravery:&mdash;But Colonel Morden has had his girls, as well as you and I. And indeed, either openly or &s;ecretly, who has not? The devil always baits with a pretty wench, when he angles for a man, be his age, rank, or de|gree, what it will.</P>
<P>I have often heard my Beloved &s;peak of the Colonel with great di&s;tinction and e&s;teem. I wi&s;h he could make matters a little ea&s;ier, for her mind's &s;ake, between the re&s;t of the implacables and her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Methinks I am &s;orry for hone&s;t Belton. But a man
<PB N="383" REF="384">
cannot be ill, or vapouri&s;h, but thou lifte&s;t up thy &s;hriek-owl note, and kille&s;t him immediately. None but a fel|low, who is fit for a drummer in death's forlorn-hope, could take &s;o much delight, as thou do&s;t, in beating a dead-march with thy goo&s;e-quills.</P>
<P>I &s;hall call thee &s;eriou&s;ly to account, when I &s;ee thee, for the extracts thou ha&s;t given the lady from my letters, not|with&s;tanding what I &s;aid in my la&s;t; e&s;pecially if &s;he con|tinue to refu&s;e me. An hundred times have I known a woman deny, yet comply at la&s;t: But, by the&s;e extracts, thou ha&s;t, I doubt, made her bar up the door of her heart, as &s;he u&s;ed to do her chamber-door, again&s;t me. &mdash; This therefore is a di&s;loyalty that friend&s;hip cannot bear, nor honour allow me to forgive.</P>

<P>I Believe I am bound to cur&s;e thee, Jack. Neverthele&s;s I won't anticipate, but proceed to write thee a longer letter, than thou ha&s;t had from me for &s;ome time pa&s;t. So here goes.</P>
<P>That thou mighte&s;t have as little notice as po&s;&s;ible of the time I was re&s;olved to be in town, I &s;et out in my Lord's chariot and &s;ix ye&s;terday, as &s;oon as I had di&s;patched my letter to thee, and arrived in town la&s;t night: For I knew I could have no dependance on thy friend&s;hip, where Mi&s;s Harlowe's humour was concerned.</P>
<P>I had no other place &s;o ready, and &s;o was forced to go to my old lodgings, where al&s;o my wardrobe is; and there I poured out millions of cur&s;es upon the whole crew, and refu&s;ed to &s;ee either Sally or Polly; and this not only for &s;uffering the lady to e&s;cape; but for the villainous ar|re&s;t, and for their in&s;olence to her at the officer's hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I dre&s;s'd my&s;elf in a never-worn &s;uit, which I had in|tended for one of my wedding-&s;uits:&mdash;And liked my&s;elf &s;o well, that I began to think with thee, that my out&s;ide was the be&s;t of me.</P>
<P>I took a chair to Smith's, my heart bounding in almo&s;t audible thumps to my throat, with the a&s;&s;ured expectation
<PB N="384" REF="385">
of &s;eeing my Beloved. I cla&s;ped my fingers, as I was danced along: I charged my eyes to langui&s;h and &s;parkle by turns: I talked to my knees, telling them how they mu&s;t bend; and, in the language of a charming de&s;criber, acted my part in fancy, as well as &s;poke it to my&s;elf:
<Q><L>Tenderly kneeling, <HI>thus</HI> will I complain:</L>
<L><HI>Thus</HI> court her pity; and <HI>thus</HI> plead my pain:</L>
<L><HI>Thus</HI> &s;igh for fancied frowns, if frowns &s;hould ri&s;e;</L>
<L>And <HI>thus</HI> meet favour in her &s;oftning eyes.</L></Q></P>
<P>In this manner entertained I my&s;elf, till I arrived at Smith's; and there the fellows &s;et down their gay burden. Off went their hats; Will. ready at hand in a new livery; up went the head; out ru&s;h'd my Honour; the woman behind the compter all in flutters;&mdash;re&s;pect and fear giving due &s;olemnity to her features; and her knees, I doubt not, knocking again&s;t the in&s;ide of her wain&s;cot fence.</P>
<P>Your &s;ervant, Madam&mdash;Will. let the fellows move to &s;ome di&s;tance, and wait.</P>
<P>You have a young lady lodges here; Mi&s;s Harlowe, Madam: Is &s;he above?</P>
<P>Sir, Sir, and plea&s;e your Honour [The woman is &s;truck with my figure, thinks I]: Mi&s;s Harlowe, Sir! There is, indeed, &s;uch a young lady lodges here&mdash;But, but&mdash;</P>
<P>But what, Madam? &mdash; I mu&s;t &s;ee her. &mdash; One pair of &s;tairs; is it not?&mdash;Don't trouble your&s;elf&mdash;I &s;hall find her apartment. And was making towards the &s;tairs.</P>
<P>Sir, Sir, the lady, the lady is not at home&mdash;She is abroad&mdash;She is in the country&mdash;</P>
<P>In the country! Not at home!&mdash;Impo&s;&s;ible! You will not pa&s;s this &s;tory upon me, good woman. I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> &s;ee her. I have bu&s;ine&s;s of life and death with her.</P>
<P>Indeed, Sir, the lady is not at home! Indeed, Sir, &s;he is abroad!&mdash;</P>
<P>She then rung a bell: John, cried &s;he, pray &s;tep down!&mdash;Indeed, Sir, the lady is not at home.</P>
<P>Down came John, the good man of the hou&s;e, when I expected one of his journeymen, by her &s;awcy familiarity.</P>
<P>My dear, &s;aid &s;he, the gentleman will not believe Mi&s;s Harlowe is abroad.</P>
<P>John bow'd to my fine cloaths, Your &s;ervant, Sir&mdash;In|deed
<PB N="385" REF="386">
the lady is abroad. She went out of town this morn|ing by &s;ix o'clock&mdash;into the country&mdash;by the Doctor's ad|vice.</P>
<P>Still I would not believe either John or his wife. I am &s;ure, &s;aid I, &s;he cannot be abroad. I heard &s;he was very ill&mdash;She is not able to go out in a coach. Do you know Mr. Belford, friend?</P>
<P>Yes, Sir; I have the honour to know 'Squire Belford. He is gone into the country to vi&s;it a &s;ick friend. He went on Saturday, Sir.</P>
<P>This had al&s;o been told from thy lodgings to Will. whom I &s;ent to de&s;ire to &s;ee thee, on my fir&s;t coming to town.</P>
<P>Well, and Mr. Belford wrote me word that &s;he was ex|ceeding ill. How then can &s;he be gone out?</P>
<P>O Sir, &s;he is very ill; very ill, indeed&mdash;Could hardly walk to the coach.</P>
<P>Belford, thought I, <HI>him&s;elf</HI> knew nothing of the time of my coming; neither can he have received my letter of ye&s;terday: And &s;o ill, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible &s;he would go out.</P>
<P>Where is her &s;ervant? Call her &s;ervant to me.</P>
<P>Her &s;ervant, Sir, is her nur&s;e: She has no other. And <HI>&s;he</HI> is gone with her.</P>
<P>Well, friend, I mu&s;t not believe you. You'll excu&s;e me; but I mu&s;t go up &s;tairs my&s;elf. And was &s;tepping up.</P>
<P>John hereupon put on a &s;erious, and a le&s;s re&s;pectful face&mdash;Sir, this hou&s;e is mine; and&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>And</HI> what, friend? not doubting then but &s;he was above.&mdash;I mu&s;t and will &s;ee her. I have authority for it. I am a ju&s;tice of peace. I have a &s;earch warrant.</P>
<P>And up I went; they following me, muttering, and in a plaguy flutter.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t door I came to was lock'd. I tapp'd at it.</P>
<P>The lady, Sir, has the key of her own apartment.</P>
<P>On the in&s;ide, I que&s;tion not, my hone&s;t friend; tapping again. And being a&s;&s;ured, if &s;he heard my voice, that her timorous and &s;oft temper would make her betray her|&s;elf, by &s;ome flutters, to my li&s;tening ear, I &s;aid aloud, I am confident Mi&s;s Harlowe is here: Deare&s;t Madam, open the door: Admit me but for one moment to your pre&s;ence.</P>
<P><PB N="386" REF="387">But neither an&s;wer nor fluttering &s;aluted my ear; and, the people being very quiet, I led on to the next apartment; and, the key being on the out&s;ide, I opened it, and looked all round it, and into the clo&s;et.</P>
<P>The man &s;aid, He never &s;aw &s;o uncivil a gentleman in his life.</P>
<P>Hark thee, friend, &s;aid I; Let me advi&s;e thee to be a little decent; or I &s;hall teach thee a le&s;&s;on thou never learned&s;t in all thy life.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid he, 'tis not like a gentleman, to affront a man in his own hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Then pr'ythee, man, replied I, don't crow upon thine own dunghill.</P>
<P>I &s;tepped back to the locked door: My dear Mi&s;s Har|lowe, I beg of you to open the door, or I'll break it open;&mdash;pu&s;hing hard again&s;t it, that it crack'd again.</P>
<P>The man looked pale; and, trembling and with his fright, made a plaguy long face; and called to one of his bodice-makers above, <HI>Jo&s;eph, come down quickly.</HI></P>
<P>Jo&s;eph came down: A lion's-face grinning fellow; thick, and &s;hort, and bu&s;hy-headed, like an old oak-pol|lard. Then did ma&s;ter John put on a &s;turdier look. But I only humm'd a tune, travers'd all the other apartments, &s;ounded the pa&s;&s;ages with my knuckles, to find whether there were private doors, and walked up the next pair of &s;tairs, &s;inging all the way; John, and Jo&s;eph, and Mrs. Smith, following me trembling.</P>
<P>I looked round me there, and went into two open-door bed-chambers; &s;earched the clo&s;ets, the pa&s;&s;ages, and peeped thro' the key-hole of another: No Mi&s;s Harlowe, by Jupiter! What &s;hall I do!&mdash;What &s;hall I do!&mdash;Now will &s;he be grieved that &s;he is out of the way.</P>
<P>I &s;aid this on purpo&s;e to find out whether the&s;e people knew the lady's &s;tory; and had the an&s;wer I expected from Mrs. Smith&mdash;I believe not, Sir, &s;aid &s;he.</P>
<P>Why &s;o, Mrs. Smith? Do you know who I am?</P>
<P>I can gue&s;s, Sir.</P>
<P>Whom do you gue&s;s me to be?</P>
<P>Your name is Mr. Lovelace, Sir, I make no doubt.</P>
<P>The very &s;ame. But how came you to gue&s;s &s;o well, dame Smith? You never &s;aw me before&mdash;Did you?</P>
<P><PB N="387" REF="388">Here, Jack, I laid out for a compliment, and mi&s;&s;ed it.</P>
<P>'Tis ea&s;y to gue&s;s, Sir; for there cannot be two &s;uch gentlemen as you.</P>
<P>Well &s;aid, dame Smith&mdash;But mean you <HI>good</HI> or <HI>bad?&mdash;Hand&s;ome</HI> was the lea&s;t I thought &s;he would have &s;aid.</P>
<P>I leave you to gue&s;s, Sir.</P>
<P>Condemned, thinks I, by my&s;elf, on this appeal.</P>
<P>Why, father Smith, thy wife is a wit, man!&mdash;Did&s;t thou ever find that out before?&mdash;But where is widow Lo|vick, dame Smith? My cou&s;in John Belford &s;ays &s;he is a very good woman. Is &s;he within? Or is <HI>&s;he</HI> gone with Mi&s;s Harlowe too?</P>
<P>She will be within by-and-by, Sir. She is not with the lady.</P>
<P>Well, but my good dear Mrs. Smith, where is the lady gone? And when will &s;he return?</P>
<P>I can't tell, Sir.</P>
<P>Don't tell fibs, dame Smith; don't tell fibs; chucking her under the chin: Which made John's upper-lip, with chin &s;hortened, ri&s;e to his no&s;e&mdash;I am &s;ure you know!&mdash;But here's another pair of &s;tairs: Let us &s;ee; Who lives up there? &mdash; But hold, here's another room lock'd up, tapping at the door&mdash;Who's at home, cry'd I?</P>
<P>That's Mrs. Lovick's apartment. She is gone out, and has the key with her.</P>
<P>Widow Lovick! rapping again, I believe you are at home: Pray open the door.</P>
<P>John and Jo&s;eph muttered and whi&s;pered together.</P>
<P>No whi&s;pering, hone&s;t friends: 'Tis not manners to whi&s;per. Jo&s;eph, what &s;aid John to thee?</P>
<P>JOHN, Sir! di&s;dainfully repeated the good woman.</P>
<P>I beg pardon, Mrs. Smith: But you &s;ee the force of ex|ample. Had <HI>you</HI> &s;hewed your hone&s;t man more re&s;pect, <HI>I</HI> &s;hould. Let me give you a piece of advice:&mdash;Women who treat their hu&s;bands irreverently, teach &s;trangers to u&s;e them with contempt. There, hone&s;t ma&s;ter John; why do&s;t not pull off thy hat to me?&mdash;O, &s;o thou would&s;t, if thou had&s;t it on: But thou never weare&s;t thy hat in thy wife's pre&s;ence, I believe; do&s;t thou?</P>
<P>None of your fleers and your jeers, Sir, cry'd John. I wi&s;h every married pair lived as happily as we do.</P>
<P><PB N="388" REF="389">I wi&s;h &s;o too, hone&s;t friend. But I'll be hang'd if thou ha&s;t any children.</P>
<P>Why &s;o, Sir?</P>
<P>Ha&s;t thou?&mdash;An&s;wer me, man: Ha&s;t thou, or not?</P>
<P>Perhaps not, Sir. But what of that?</P>
<P>What of that?&mdash;Why I'll tell thee. The man who has no children by his wife mu&s;t put up with plain John. Had&s;t thou a child or two, thou'd&s;t be called Mr. Smith, with a courte&s;y, or a &s;mile at lea&s;t, at every word.</P>
<P>You are very plea&s;ant, Sir, replied my dame. I fancy, if either my hu&s;band or I had as much to an&s;wer for as I know whom, we &s;hould not be &s;o merry.</P>
<P>Why then, dame Smith, &s;o much the wor&s;e for tho&s;e who were obliged to keep you company. But I am not merry&mdash;I am &s;ad!&mdash;Hey-ho!&mdash;Where &s;hall I find my dear Mi&s;s Harlowe?</P>
<P>My beloved Mi&s;s Harlowe! (calling at the foot of the third pair of &s;tairs) if you are above, for God's &s;ake an|&s;wer me. I am coming up.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid the good man, I wi&s;h you'd walk down. The &s;ervants rooms, and the working rooms, are up tho&s;e &s;tairs, and another pair; and no-body's there that you want.</P>
<P>Shall I go up, and &s;ee if Mi&s;s Harlowe be there, Mrs. Smith?</P>
<P>You may, Sir, if you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Then I won't; for, if &s;he was, you would not be &s;o obliging.</P>
<P>I am a&s;hamed to give you all this attendance: You are the polite&s;t traders I ever knew. Hone&s;t Jo&s;eph, &s;lapping him upon the &s;houlders on a &s;udden, which made him jump, did&s;t ever grin for a wager, man?&mdash;For the ra&s;cal &s;eemed not di&s;plea&s;ed with me; and, cracking his flat face from ear to ear, with a di&s;tended mouth, &s;hew'd his teeth, as broad and as black as his thumb-nails. But don't I hinder thee? What can&s;t earn a-day, man?</P>
<P>Half a crown, I can earn a-day; with an air of pride and petulance, at being &s;tartled.</P>
<P>There then is a day's wages for thee. But thou neede&s;t not attend me further.</P>
<P>Come, Mrs. Smith, come, John, ma&s;ter Smith I &s;hould
<PB N="389" REF="390">
&s;ay; let's walk down, and give me an account where the lady is gone, and when &s;he will return.</P>
<P>So down &s;tairs led I. John and Jo&s;eph (tho' I had di&s;|charged the latter), and my dame, following me, to &s;hew their complai&s;ance to a &s;tranger.</P>
<P>I re-entered one of the fir&s;t-floor rooms. I have a great mind to be your lodger: For I never &s;aw &s;uch obliging folks in my life. What rooms have you to lett?</P>
<P>None at all, Sir.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry for that. But who&s;e is this?</P>
<P>Mine, Sir, chuffily &s;aid John.</P>
<P>Thine, man! Why then I will take it of thee. This, and a bed-chamber, and a garret for my &s;ervant, will con|tent me. I will give thee thy own price, and half a guinea a day over, for tho&s;e conveniencies.</P>
<P>For ten guineas a day, Sir&mdash;</P>
<P>Hold, John! Ma&s;ter Smith, I &s;hould &s;ay&mdash;Before thou &s;peake&s;t, con&s;ider&mdash;I won't be affronted, man.</P>
<P>Sir, I wi&s;h you'd walk down, &s;aid the good woman. Really, Sir, you take&mdash;</P>
<P>Great liberties I hope you would not &s;ay, Mrs. Smith?</P>
<P>Indeed, Sir, I was going to &s;ay &s;omething like it.</P>
<P>Well, then, I am glad I prevented you; for the words better become my mouth than yours. But I mu&s;t lodge with you till the lady returns. I <HI>believe</HI> I mu&s;t. How|ever, you may be wanted in the &s;hop; &s;o we'll talk that over there.</P>
<P>Down I went, they paying diligent attendance on my &s;teps.</P>
<P>When I came into the &s;hop, &s;eeing no chair or &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ool. I went behind the compter, and &s;at down under an arched kind of canopy of carved-work, which the&s;e proud traders, emulating the royal nich-fillers, often give them|&s;elves, while a joint-&s;tool, perhaps, &s;erves tho&s;e by whom they get their bread: Such is the dignity of trade in this mercantile nation!</P>
<P>I looked about me, and above me, and told them I was very proud of my &s;eat; a&s;king, If John were ever per|mitted to fill this &s;uperb nich?</P>
<P>Perhaps he was, he &s;aid, very &s;urlily.</P>
<P>That is it, cry'd I, that makes thee look &s;o like a &s;ta|tue, man.</P>
<P><PB N="390" REF="391">John looked plaguy glum upon me. But his man Jo|&s;eph and my man Will. turned round with their backs to us, to hide their grinning, with each his fi&s;t in his mouth.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked, What it was they &s;old?</P>
<P>Powder, and wa&s;h-balls, and &s;nuff, they &s;aid; and gloves and &s;tockens.</P>
<P>O come, I'll be your cu&s;tomer. Will. do I want wa&s;h-balls?</P>
<P>Yes, and plea&s;e your Honour, you can di&s;pen&s;e with one or two.</P>
<P>Give him half a dozen, dame Smith.</P>
<P>She told me &s;he mu&s;t come where I was, to &s;erve them. Pray, Sir, walk from behind the compter.</P>
<P>Indeed but I won't. The &s;hop &s;hall be mine. Where are they, if a cu&s;tomer &s;hould come in?</P>
<P>She pointed over my head, with a pur&s;e-mouth, as if &s;he would not have &s;imper'd, could &s;he have help'd it. I reached down the gla&s;s, and gave Will. &s;ix. There&mdash;put 'em up, &s;irrah.</P>
<P>He did, grinning with his teeth out before; which touching my con&s;cience, as the lo&s;s of them was owing to me, Jo&s;eph, &s;aid I, come hither. Come hither, man, when I bid thee.</P>
<P>He &s;talked towards me, his hands behind him, half willing, and half unwilling.</P>
<P>I &s;uddenly wrapt my arm round his neck. Will. thy penknife, this moment. D&mdash;n the fellow, where's thy penknife?</P>
<P>O Lord! &s;aid the pollard-headed dog, &s;truggling to get his head loo&s;e from under my arm, while my other hand was muzzling about his cur&s;ed chaps, as if I would take his teeth out.</P>
<P>I will pay thee a good price, man: Don't &s;truggle thus! The penknife, Will!</P>
<P>O Lord! cry'd Jo&s;eph, &s;truggling &s;till more and more: And out comes Will's pruning-knife; for the ra&s;cal is a gardener in the country. I have only this, Sir.</P>
<P>The be&s;t in the world to launch a gum. D&mdash;n the fel|low, why do&s;t &s;truggle thus?</P>
<P>Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;tre&s;s Smith being afraid, I &s;uppo&s;e, that I had a de&s;ign upon Jo&s;eph's throat, becau&s;e he was their
<PB N="391" REF="392">
champion (and this, indeed, made me take the more no|tice of him), coming towards me with countenances tragi|comical, I let him go.</P>
<P>I only wanted, &s;aid I, to take out two or three of this ra&s;cal's broad teeth, to put them into my &s;ervant's jaws&mdash;And I would have paid him his price for them.&mdash;I would, by my &s;oul, Jo&s;eph.</P>
<P>Jo&s;eph &s;hook his ears; and with both hands &s;troaked down, &s;mooth as it would lie, his bu&s;hy hair; and looked at me, as if he knew not whether he &s;hould laugh or be angry: But, after a &s;tupid &s;tare or two, &s;talked off to the other end of the &s;hop, nodding his head at me as he went, &s;till &s;troaking down his hair, and took his &s;tand by his ma&s;ter, facing about, and muttering, that I was plaguy &s;trong in the arms, and he thought would have throttled him. Then folding his arms, and &s;haking his bri&s;tled head, added, 'Twas well I was a gentleman, or he would not have taken &s;uch an affront.</P>
<P>I demanded where their rappee was? The good woman pointed to the place; and I took up a &s;collop-&s;hell of it, refu&s;ing to let her weigh it, and filled my box. And now, Mrs. Smith, &s;aid I, where are your gloves?</P>
<P>She &s;hewed me; and I cho&s;e four pair of them, and &s;et Jo&s;eph, who looked as if he wanted to be taken notice of again, to open the fingers.</P>
<P>A female cu&s;tomer, who had been gaping at the door, came in for &s;ome Scots &s;nuff; and I would &s;erve her. The wench was plaguy homely; and I told her &s;o; or el&s;e, I &s;aid, I would have treated her. She in anger (No woman is homely in her own opinion) threw down her peny; and I put it in my pocket.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t then, turning my eye to the door, I &s;aw a pretty genteel lady, with a footman after her, peeping in with a What's the matter, good folks? to the &s;tarers; and I ran to her from behind the compter, and, as &s;he was making off, took her hand, and drew her into the &s;hop, begging that &s;he would be my cu&s;tomer; for that I had but ju&s;t be|gun trade.</P>
<P>What do you &s;ell, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, &s;miling; but a little &s;urpri&s;ed?</P>
<P>Tapes, ribbands, &s;ilk-laces, pins, and needles; for I am
<PB N="392" REF="393">
a pedlar: Powder, patches, wa&s;h-balls, &s;tockens, garters, &s;nuffs, and pin-cu&s;hions&mdash;Don't we, goody Smith?</P>
<P>So in I gently drew her to the compter, running behind it my&s;elf, with an air of great diligence and obligingne&s;s. I have excellent gloves and wa&s;h-balls, Madam; Rappee, Scots, Portugal, and all &s;orts of &s;nuff.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid &s;he, in very good humour, I'll encourage a young beginner for once. Here, Andrew (to her footman) you want a pair of gloves, don't you?</P>
<P>I took down a parcel of gloves, which Mrs. Smith point|ed to, and came round to the fellow to fit them on my&s;elf.</P>
<P>No matter for opening them, &s;aid I: Thy fingers, friend, are as &s;tiff as drum&s;ticks. Pu&s;h&mdash;Thou'rt an aukward dog! I wonder &s;uch a pretty lady will be followed by &s;uch a clum&s;y varlet.</P>
<P>The fellow had no &s;trength for laughing: And Jo&s;eph was mightily plea&s;ed, in hopes, I &s;uppo&s;e, I would bor|row a few of Andrew's teeth, to keep him in countenance: And, like all the world, as the je&s;t was turned from them|&s;elves, father and mother Smith &s;eem'd diverted with the humour.</P>
<P>The fellow &s;aid, the gloves were too little.</P>
<P>Thru&s;t, and be d&mdash;n'd to thee, &s;aid I: Why, fellow, thou ha&s;t not the &s;trength of a cat.</P>
<P>Sir, Sir, &s;aid he, laughing, I &s;hall hurt your Honour's &s;ide.</P>
<P>D&mdash;n thee, thru&s;t, I &s;ay.</P>
<P>He did; and bur&s;t out the &s;ides of the glove.</P>
<P>Will. &s;aid I, where's thy pruning-knife? By my &s;oul, friend, I had a good mind to pare thy cur&s;ed paws. But come, here's a larger pair: Try them, when thou gette&s;t home; and let thy &s;weetheart, if thou ha&s;t one, mend the other; and &s;o take both.</P>
<P>The lady laughed at the humour; as did my fellow, and Mrs. Smith, and Jo&s;eph: Even John laughed, tho' he &s;eemed, by the force put upon his countenance, to be but half plea&s;ed with me neither.</P>
<P>Madam, &s;aid I, and &s;tept behind the compter, bowing over it, now I hope you will buy &s;omething for your&s;elf. No-body &s;hall u&s;e you better, nor &s;ell you cheaper.</P>
<P>Come, &s;aid &s;he, give me &s;ix peny-worth of Portugal &s;nuff.</P>
<P><PB N="393" REF="394">They &s;hewed me where it was, and I &s;erved her; and &s;aid, when &s;he would have paid me, I took nothing at my opening.</P>
<P>If I treated her footman, &s;he told me, I &s;hould not treat her.</P>
<P>Well, with all my heart, &s;aid I: 'Tis not for Us trade&s;|men to be &s;aucy&mdash;Is it, Mrs. Smith?</P>
<P>I put her &s;ixpence in my pocket; and, &s;eizing her hand, took notice to her of the croud that had gathered about the door, and be&s;ought her to walk into the back &s;hop with me.</P>
<P>She &s;truggled her hand out of mine, and would &s;tay no longer.</P>
<P>So I bow'd, and bid her kindly welcome, and thanked her, and hoped I &s;hould have her cu&s;tom another time.</P>
<P>She went away &s;miling; and Andrew after her; who made me a fine bow.</P>
<P>I began to be out of countenance at the crowd, which thicken'd apace; and bid Will. order the chair to the door.</P>
<P>Well, Mrs. Smith, with a grave air, I am heartily &s;orry Mi&s;s Harlowe is abroad. You don't tell me where &s;he is?</P>
<P>Indeed, Sir, I cannot.</P>
<P>You <HI>will</HI> not, you mean.&mdash;She could have no notion of my coming. I came to town but la&s;t night &mdash; Have been very ill. She has almo&s;t broke my heart, by her cru|elty. You know my &s;tory, I doubt not. Tell her, I mu&s;t go out of town to-morrow morning. But I will &s;end my &s;ervant, to know if &s;he will favour me with one half-hour's conver&s;ation; for, as &s;oon as I get down, I &s;hall &s;et out for Dover, in my way to France, if I have not a coun|termand from her who has the &s;ole di&s;po&s;al of my fate.</P>
<P>And &s;o, flinging down a Portugal Six-and-thirty, I took Mr. Smith by the hand, telling him, I was &s;orry we had not more time to be better acquainted; and bidding ho|ne&s;t Jo&s;eph farewell; who purs'd up his mouth as I pa&s;&s;ed by him, as if he thought his teeth &s;till in jeopardy; and bidding Mrs. Smith adieu, and to recommend me to her fair lodger, humm'd an air, and, the chair being come, whipt into it; the people about the door &s;eeming to be in good humour with me; one crying, A plea&s;ant gentle|man,
<PB N="394" REF="395">I warrant him! And away I was carried to White's, according to direction.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I came thither, I ordered Will. to go and change his cloaths, and to di&s;gui&s;e him&s;elf by putting on his black wig, and keeping his mouth &s;hut; and then to dodge about Smith's, to inform him&s;elf of the lady's motions.</P>
<P>I GIVE thee this impudent account of my&s;elf, that thou may&s;t rave at me, and call me harden'd, and what thou wilt. For, in the fir&s;t place, I, who had been &s;o lately ill, was glad I was alive; and then I was &s;o balked by my charmer's unexpected ab&s;ence, and &s;o ruffled by that, and by the bluff treatment of father John, that I had no other way to avoid being out of humour with all I met with. Moreover I was rejoiced to find, by the lady's ab&s;ence, and by her going out at &s;ix in the morning, that it was im|po&s;&s;ible &s;he &s;hould be &s;o ill as thou repre&s;ented&s;t her to be; and this gave me &s;till higher &s;pirits. Then I know the Sex always love chearful and humorous fellows. The dear creature her&s;elf u&s;ed to be plea&s;ed with my gay tem|per and lively manner; and had &s;he been told, that I was blubbering for her in the back &s;hop, &s;he would have de|&s;pi&s;ed me &s;till more than &s;he does.</P>
<P>Furthermore, I was &s;en&s;ible, that the people of the hou&s;e mu&s;t needs have a terrible notion of me, as a &s;avage, bloody-minded, obdurate fellow; a perfect woman-eater; and, no doubt, expected to &s;ee me with the claws of a lion, and the fangs of a tyger; and it was but policy to &s;hew them, what a harmle&s;s, plea&s;ant fellow I am, in or|der to familiarize the John's and the Jo&s;eph's to me. For it was evident to me, by the good woman's calling them down, that &s;he thought me a dangerous man. Whereas now, John and I having &s;haken hands together, and dame Smith having &s;een that I have the face, and hands, and looks of a man, and walk upright, and prate, and laugh, and joke, like other people; and Jo&s;eph, that I can talk of taking his teeth out of his head, without doing him the lea&s;t hurt; they will all, at my next vi&s;it, be much more ea&s;y and plea&s;ant with me than Andrew's gloves were to him; and we &s;hall be <HI>hail, fellow, well met,</HI> as the &s;ay|ing
<PB N="395" REF="396">
is, and as thoroughly acquainted, as if we had known one another a twelvemonth.</P>
<P>When I returned to our mother's, I again cur&s;ed her and all her nymphs together; and &s;till refu&s;ed to &s;ee ei|ther Sally or Polly. I raved at the horrid arre&s;t; and told the old dragon, that it was owing to her and hers, that the faire&s;t virtue in the world was ruined; my reputation for ever bla&s;ted; and that I was not married, and happy in the love of the mo&s;t excellent of her &s;ex.</P>
<P>She, to pacify me, &s;aid, &s;he would &s;hew me a new face that would plea&s;e me; &s;ince I would not &s;ee my Sally, who was dying for grief.</P>
<P>Where is this new face, cry'd I? Let me &s;ee her, tho' I &s;hall never &s;ee any face with plea&s;ure but Mi&s;s Harlowe's.</P>
<P>She won't come down, reply'd &s;he. She will not be at the word of command yet &mdash;Is but ju&s;t in the tramels; and mu&s;t be waited upon, I'll a&s;&s;ure you; and courted much be&s;ides.</P>
<P>Ay! &s;aid I, that looks well. Lead me to her this in&s;tant.</P>
<P>I followed her up: And who &s;hould &s;he be, but that little toad, Sally.</P>
<P>O cur&s;e you, &s;aid I, for a devil, is it you? Is yours the new face?</P>
<P>O my dear, dear Mr. Lovelace? cry'd &s;he, I am glad any-thing will bring you to me! And &s;o the little bea&s;t threw her&s;elf about my neck, and there clung like a cat. Come, &s;aid &s;he, what will you give me, and I'll be vir|tuous for a quarter of an hour, and mimic your Clari&s;&s;a to the life.</P>
<P>I was <HI>Belforded</HI> all over. I could not bear &s;uch an in|&s;ult upon the dear creature (for I have a &s;oft and gene|rous nature in the main, whatever you think); and cur&s;ed her mo&s;t devoutly, for taking her name in her mouth in &s;uch a way. But the little devil was not to be balked; but fell a crying, &s;obbing, praying, begging, exclaiming, fainting, &s;o that I never &s;aw my lovely girl &s;o well aped; and I was almo&s;t taken in; for I could have fancied I had her before me once more.</P>
<P>O this Sex! this artful Sex! There's no minding them. At fir&s;t, indeed, their grief and their concern may be real: But give way to the hurricane, and it will &s;oon die away
<PB N="396" REF="397">
in &s;oft murmurs, trilling upon your ears like the notes of a well-tuned viol. And, by Sally, one &s;ees, that Art will generally &s;o well &s;upply the place of Nature, that you &s;hall not ea&s;ily know the difference. Mi&s;s Harlowe, indeed, is the only woman in the world, I believe, that can &s;ay, in the words of her favourite Job (for I can quote a text as well as &s;he), <HI>But it is not &s;o with me.</HI></P>
<P>They were very inqui&s;itive about my fair one. They told me, that you &s;eldom came near them; that, when you did, you put on plaguy grave airs; would hardly &s;tay five minutes; and did nothing but prai&s;e Mi&s;s Harlowe, and lament her hard fate. In &s;hort, that you de&s;pi&s;ed them; was full of &s;entences; and they doubted not, in a little while, would be a lo&s;t man, and marry.</P>
<P>A pretty character for thee, is it not? Thou art in a ble&s;&s;ed way, yet ha&s;t nothing to do but to <HI>go on in it;</HI> and then what a work ha&s;t thou to go through! If thou turne&s;t back, the&s;e &s;orcere&s;&s;es will be like the Czar's Co&s;&s;acks (at Pultowa, I think it was), who were planted with ready primed and cocked pieces, behind the regulars, in order to &s;hoot them dead, if they did not pu&s;h on, and conquer; and then wilt thou be mo&s;t lamentably de&s;pi&s;ed by every harlot thou ha&s;t made &mdash; And, O Jack! how formidable, in that ca&s;e, will be the number of thy enemies!</P>
<P>I intend to regulate my motions by Will's intelligence; for &s;ee this dear creature I mu&s;t and will. Yet I have pro|mi&s;ed Lord M to be down in two or three days, at far|the&s;t; for he is grown plaguy fond of me &s;ince I was ill.</P>
<P>I am in hopes, that the word I left, that I am to go out of town to-morrow morning, will &s;oon bring the lady back again.</P>
<P>Mean time, I thought I would write to divert thee, while thou art of &s;uch importance about the dying; and as thy &s;ervant, it &s;eems, comes backward and forward every day, perhaps I may &s;end thee another to-morrow, with the particulars of the interview between the dear lady and me; after which my &s;oul thir&s;teth.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Tue&s;day, Aug.</HI> 22.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Mu&s;t write on, to divert my&s;elf: For I can get no re&s;t; no refre&s;hing re&s;t. I awaked ju&s;t now in a cur&s;ed fright. How a man may be affected by dreams!</P>
<Q><P>Methought I had an interview with my beloved. I found her all goodne&s;s, conde&s;cen&s;ion, and forgivene&s;s. She &s;uffer'd her&s;elf to be overcome in my favour by the joint interce&s;&s;ions of Lord M, Lady Sarah, Lady Betty, and my two cou&s;ins Montague, who waited upon her in deep mourning; the ladies in long trains &s;weeping after them; Lord M. in a long black mantle trailing after <HI>him.</HI> They told her, they came in the&s;e robes to ex|pre&s;s their &s;orrow for my &s;ins again&s;t her, and to im|plore her to forgive me.</P>
<P>I my&s;elf, I thought, was upon my knees, with a &s;word in my hand, offering either to put it up in the &s;cabbard, or to thru&s;t it into my heart, as &s;he &s;hould com|mand the one or the other.</P>
<P>At that moment her cou&s;in Morden, I thought, all of a &s;udden, fla&s;h'd in thro' a window, with his drawn &s;word&mdash;Die, Lovelace, &s;aid he! this in&s;tant die, and be damned, if in earne&s;t thou repaire&s;t not by marriage my cou&s;in's wrongs!</P>
<P>I was ri&s;ing to re&s;ent this in&s;ult, I thought, when Lord M. run between us with his great black mantle, and threw it over my face: And in&s;tantly, my charmer, with that &s;weet voice which has &s;o often played upon my ravi&s;hed ears, wrapped her arms round me, muffled as I was in my Lord M's mantle, O &s;pare, &s;pare my Lovelace! And &s;pare, O Lovelace, my beloved cou&s;in Morden! Let me not have my di&s;tre&s;&s;es augmented by the fall of either or both of tho&s;e who are &s;o dear to me.</P>
<P>At this, charmed with her &s;weet mediation, I thought I would have cla&s;ped her in my arms: When immedi|ately the mo&s;t angelic form I had ever beheld, ve&s;ted all in tran&s;parent white, de&s;cended from a ceiling, which, opening, di&s;covered a ceiling above that, &s;tuck
<PB N="398" REF="399">
round with golden cherubs and glittering &s;eraphs, all exulting, Welcome, welcome, welcome! and, encircling my charmer, a&s;cended with her to the region of &s;era|phims; and in&s;tantly, the opening ceiling clo&s;ing, I lo&s;t &s;ight of <HI>her,</HI> and of the <HI>bright form</HI> together, and found wrapt in my arms her azure robe (all &s;tuck thick with &s;tars of embo&s;&s;ed &s;ilver), which I had caught hold of in hopes of detaining her; but was all that was left me of my beloved Mi&s;s Harlowe. And then (horrid to relate!) the floor &s;inking under <HI>me,</HI> as the ceiling had opened for <HI>her,</HI> I dropt into a hole more frightful than that of El|den; and, tumbling over and over down it, without view of a bottom, I awaked in a panic; and was as effectu|ally di&s;ordered for half an hour, as if my dream had been a reality.</P></Q>
<P>Wilt thou forgive me troubling thee with &s;uch vi&s;ionary &s;tuff? Thou wilt &s;ee by it, only, that, &s;leeping or waking, my Clari&s;&s;a is always pre&s;ent with me.</P>
<P>But here this moment is Will. come running hither to tell me, that his lady actually returned to her lodgings la&s;t night between eleven and twelve, and is now there, tho' very ill.</P>
<P>I ha&s;ten to her. But, that I may not add to her indi&s;|po&s;ition, by any rough or boi&s;terous behaviour, I will be as &s;oft and gentle as the dove her&s;elf in my addre&s;&s;es to her.</P>
<Q><L>That I do love her, O all ye ho&s;t of heaven,</L>
<L>Be witne&s;s!&mdash;That &s;he is dear to me!</L>
<L>Dearer than day to one whom &s;ight mu&s;t leave;</L>
<L>Dearer than life, to one who fears to die;</L></Q>

<P>CURSE upon my &s;tars!&mdash;Di&s;appointed again!</P>
<P>It was about eight when I arrived at Smith's&mdash;The woman was in the &s;hop.</P>
<P>So, old acquaintance, how do you now? I know my Love is above. &mdash; Let her be acquainted that I am here,
<PB N="399" REF="400">
waiting for admi&s;&s;ion to her pre&s;ence, and can take no denial. Tell her, that I will approach her with the mo&s;t re&s;pectful duty, and in who&s;e company &s;he plea&s;es; and I will not touch the hem of her garment, without her leave.</P>
<P>Indeed, Sir, you're mi&s;taken. The lady is not in this hou&s;e, nor near it.</P>
<P>I'll &s;ee that.&mdash;Will! beckoning him to me, and whi&s;|pering, See if thou can&s;t any way find out (without lo&s;ing &s;ight of the door, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould be below-&s;tairs) if &s;he be in the neighbourhood, if not within.</P>
<P>Will. bowed and went off. Up went I, without further ceremony; attended now only by the good woman.</P>
<P>I went into each apartment, except that which was lock|ed before, and was now al&s;o locked: And I called to Mi&s;s Harlowe in the voice of Love; but by the &s;till &s;ilence was convinced &s;he was not there. Yet, on the &s;trength of my intelligence, I doubted not but &s;he was in the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I then went up two pair of &s;tairs, and looked round the fir&s;t room: But no Mi&s;s Harlowe.</P>
<P>And who, pray, is in this room? &s;topping at the door of another.</P>
<P>A widow gentlewoman, Sir.&mdash;Mrs. Lovick.</P>
<P>O my dear Mrs. Lovick! &s;aid I, I am intimately ac|quainted with her character, from my cou&s;in John Belford. I mu&s;t &s;ee Mrs. Lovick by all means. Good Mrs. Lovick, open the door.</P>
<P>She did.</P>
<P>Your &s;ervant, Madam. Be &s;o good as to excu&s;e me.&mdash; You have heard my &s;tory. You are an admirer of the mo&s;t excellent woman in the world. Dear Mrs. Lovick, tell me what is become of her?</P>
<P>The poor lady, Sir, went out ye&s;terday, on purpo&s;e to avoid you.</P>
<P>How &s;o? She knew not that I would be here.</P>
<P>She was afraid you would come, when &s;he heard you were recovered from your illne&s;s.&mdash;Ah! Sir, what pity it is that &s;o fine a gentleman &s;hould make &s;uch ill returns for God's goodne&s;s to him!</P>
<P>You are an excellent woman, Mrs. Lovick: I know that, by my cou&s;in John Belford's account of you; and Mi&s;s Harlowe is an angel.</P>
<P><PB N="400" REF="401">Mi&s;s Harlowe is indeed an angel, replied &s;he; and &s;oon will be company for angels.</P>
<P>No je&s;ting with &s;uch a woman as this, Jack.</P>
<P>Tell me of a truth, good Mrs. Lovick, where I may &s;ee this dear lady. Upon my &s;oul, I will neither fright nor offend her. I will only beg of her to hear me &s;peak for one half-quarter of an hour; and, if &s;he will have it &s;o, I will never trouble her more.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid the widow, it would be death for her to &s;ee you. She was at home la&s;t night; I'll tell you truth: But fitter to be in bed all day. She came home, &s;he &s;aid, to die; and, if &s;he could not avoid your vi&s;it, &s;he was unable to fly from you; and believed &s;he &s;hould die in your pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>And yet go out again this morning early? How can that be, Widow?</P>
<P>Why, Sir, &s;he re&s;ted not two hours, for fear of you. Her fear gave her &s;trength, which &s;he'll &s;uffer for, when that fear is over. And finding her&s;elf, the more &s;he thought of it, the le&s;s able to &s;tay to receive your vi&s;it, &s;he took chair, and is gone no-body knows whither. But, I be|lieve, &s;he intended to be carried to the water-&s;ide, in order to take boat; for &s;he cannot bear a coach. It extremely incommoded her ye&s;terday.</P>
<P>But before we talk any further, &s;aid I, if &s;he be gone abroad, you can have no objection to my looking into every apartment above and below; becau&s;e I am told &s;he is actu|ally in the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Indeed, Sir, &s;he is <HI>not.</HI> You may &s;atisfy your&s;elf, if you plea&s;e: But Mrs. Smith and I waited on her to her chair. We were forced to &s;upport her, &s;he was &s;o weak. She &s;aid, Where <HI>can</HI> I go, Mrs. Lovick? Whither <HI>can</HI> I go, Mrs. Smith? &mdash; Cruel, cruel man! Tell him I called him &s;o, if he come again! &mdash; God give him that peace which he denies me!</P>
<P>Sweet creature! cry'd I, and looked down, and took out my handkerchief.</P>
<P>The widow wept. I wi&s;h, &s;aid &s;he, I had never known &s;o excellent a lady, and &s;o great a &s;ufferer! I love her as my own child!</P>
<P>Mrs. Smith wept.</P>
<P><PB N="401" REF="402">I then gave over the hope of &s;eeing her for this time. I was extremely chagrined at my di&s;appointment, and at the account they gave of her ill health.</P>
<P>Would to Heaven, &s;aid I, &s;he would put it in my power to repair her wrongs! I have been an ungrateful wretch to her. I need not tell you, Mrs. Lovick, how much I have injured her, nor how much &s;he &s;uffers by her rela|tions implacablene&s;s. 'Tis the latter, Mrs. Lovick, 'tis That, Mrs. Smith, that cuts her to the heart. Her family is the mo&s;t implacable family on earth; and the dear creature, in refu&s;ing to &s;ee me, and to be reconciled to me, &s;hews her relation to them a little too plainly.</P>
<P>O Sir, &s;aid the widow, not one &s;yllable of what you &s;ay belongs to this lady. I never &s;aw &s;o &s;weet a creature! &s;o edifying a piety! and one of &s;o forgiving a temper! She is always accu&s;ing her&s;elf, and excu&s;ing her relations. And, as as to You, Sir, &s;he forgives you: She wi&s;hes you well; and happier than you will let her be. Why will you not, Sir, why will you not, let her die in peace? 'Tis all &s;he wi&s;hes for. You don't look like a hard-hearted gentle|man!&mdash;How can you thus hunt and per&s;ecute a poor lady, whom none of her relations will look upon? It makes my heart bleed for her.</P>
<P>And then &s;he wept again. Mrs. Smith wept al&s;o. My &s;eat grew unea&s;y to me. I &s;hifted to another &s;everal times; and what Mrs. Lovick farther &s;aid, and &s;hewed me, made me &s;till more unea&s;y.</P>
<P>Bad as the poor lady was la&s;t night, &s;aid &s;he, &s;he tran|&s;cribed into her book a meditation on your per&s;ecuting her thus. I have a copy of it. If I thought it would have any effect, I would read it to you.</P>
<P>Let me read it my&s;elf, Mrs. Lovick.</P>
<P>She gave it to me. It has a Harlowe-&s;pirited title. And from a forgiving &s;pirit, intolerable. I de&s;ired to take it with me. She con&s;ented, on condition that I &s;hewed it to 'Squire Belford. So here, Mr. 'Squire Belford, thou may'&s;t read it, if thou wilt.</P>

<HEAD>On being hunted after by the enemy of my &s;oul.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Monday, Aug. 21.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>DELIVER me, O Lord, from the evil man. Pre&s;erve me from the violent man.</P>
<P><HI>Who</HI> imagines mi&s;chief in <HI>his</HI> heart.</P>
<P><HI>He</HI> hath &s;harpened <HI>his</HI> tongue like a &s;erpent. Adders poi|&s;on is under <HI>his</HI> lips.</P>
<P>Keep me, O Lord, from the hands of the wicked. Pre|&s;erve me from the violent man; <HI>who hath</HI> purpo&s;ed to over|throw my goings.</P>
<P><HI>He hath</HI> hid a &s;nare for me. He hath &s;pread a net by the way-&s;ide. <HI>He hath</HI> &s;et gins for me in the way wherein I walked.</P>
<P>Keep me from the &s;nares which <HI>he hath</HI> laid for me, and the gins of <HI>this</HI> worker of iniquity.</P>
<P>The enemy hath per&s;ecuted my &s;oul. He hath &s;mitten my life down to the ground. He hath made me dwell in dark|ne&s;s, as tho&s;e that have been long dead.</P>
<P>Therefore is my &s;pirit overwhelmed within me. My heart within me is de&s;olate.</P>
<P>Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble.</P>
<P>For my days are con&s;umed like &s;moke: and my bones are burnt as the hearth.</P>
<P>My heart is &s;mitten and withered like gra&s;s: &s;o that I for|get to eat my bread.</P>
<P>By rea&s;on of the voice of my groaning, my bones cleave to my &s;kin.</P>
<P>I am like a pelican of the wilderne&s;s. I am like an owl of the de&s;art.</P>
<P>I watch; and am as a &s;parrow alone upon the hou&s;e-top.</P>
<P>I have eaten a&s;hes like bread; and mingled my drink with weeping:</P>
<P>Becau&s;e of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou ha&s;t lifted me up, and ca&s;t me down.</P>
<P>My days are like a &s;hadow that declineth, and I am wi|thered like gra&s;s.</P>
<P>Grant not, O Lord, the de&s;ires of the wicked: further not his devices, le&s;t he exalt him&s;elf.</P>

</TEXT></Q>
<P><PB N="403" REF="404">Why now, Mrs. Lovick, &s;aid I, when I had read this meditation, as &s;he called it, I think I am very &s;everely treated by the lady, if &s;he mean <HI>me</HI> in all this. For how is it that I am the <HI>enemy of her &s;oul,</HI> when I love her both &s;oul and body?</P>
<P>She &s;ays, that I am a <HI>violent</HI> man, and a <HI>wicked</HI> man.&mdash; That I have been &s;o, I own: But I repent, and only wi&s;h to have it in my power to repair the injuries I have done her.</P>
<P>The <HI>gin,</HI> the <HI>&s;nare,</HI> the <HI>net,</HI> mean matrimony, I &s;up|po&s;e&mdash; But is it a crime in me to wi&s;h to marry her? Would any other woman think it &s;o? and choo&s;e to become a <HI>pe|lican in the wilderne&s;s,</HI> or a <HI>lonely &s;parrow on the hou&s;e-top,</HI> rather than to have a mate that would chirp about her all day and all night?</P>
<P>She &s;ays, &s;he has <HI>eaten a&s;hes like bread</HI>&mdash;A &s;ad mi&s;take to be &s;ure!&mdash; and <HI>mingled her drink with weeping</HI>&mdash; Sweet maudlin &s;oul! &s;hould I &s;ay of any-body confe&s;&s;ing this, but Mi&s;s Harlowe.</P>
<P>She concludes with praying, that <HI>the de&s;ires of the wic|ked</HI> (meaning poor me, I doubt) <HI>may not be granted;</HI> that <HI>my devices may not be furthered, le&s;t I exalt my-&s;elf.</HI> &mdash; I &s;hould undoubtedly exalt my-&s;elf, and with rea&s;on, could I have the honour and the ble&s;&s;ing of &s;uch a wife. And if my <HI>de&s;ires</HI> have &s;o honourable an end, I know not why I &s;hould be called <HI>wicked,</HI> and why I &s;hould not be allowed to hope, that my hone&s;t <HI>devices</HI> may be <HI>furthered,</HI> that I MAY exalt my&s;elf.</P>
<P>But here, Mrs. Lovick, let me a&s;k, as &s;omething is un|doubtedly meant by the <HI>lonely &s;parrow on the hou&s;e-top,</HI> Is not the dear creature at this very in&s;tant (tell me truly) concealed in Mrs. Smith's cockloft?&mdash;What &s;ay you, Mrs. Lovick; What &s;ay you, Mrs. Smith, to this?</P>
<P>They a&s;&s;ured me to the contrary; and that &s;he was actu|ally abroad, and they knew not where.</P>
<P>Thou &s;ee&s;t, Jack, that I would fain have diverted the chagrin given me by the womens talk, and by this collec|tion of Scripture-texts drawn up in array again&s;t me. And &s;everal other whim&s;ical and light things I &s;aid (all I had for it!) for this purpo&s;e. But the widow would not let me come off &s;o. She &s;tuck to me; and gave me, as I told
<PB N="404" REF="405">
thee, a good deal of unea&s;ine&s;s, by her &s;en&s;ible and &s;erious expo&s;tulations. Mrs. Smith put in now and then; and the two Jack-pudden fellows, John and Jo&s;eph, not being pre&s;ent, I had no provocation to turn the conver&s;ation into a farce; and, at la&s;t, they both joined warmly to endeavour to prevail upon me to give up all thoughts of &s;eeing the lady. But I could not hear of that. On the contrary, I be&s;ought Mrs. Smith to let me have one of her rooms but till I could &s;ee her; and were it but for one, two, or three days, I would pay a year's rent for it; and quit it the moment the interview was over. But they de|&s;ired to be excu&s;ed; and were &s;ure the lady would not come to the hou&s;e till I was gone, were it for a <HI>month.</HI></P>
<P>This plea&s;ed me; for I found they did not think her &s;o very ill as they would have me believe her to be; but I took no notice of the &s;lip, becau&s;e I would not guard them again&s;t more of the like.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I told them, I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> and <HI>would</HI> &s;ee her: But that it &s;hould be with all the re&s;pect and veneration that heart could pay to excellence like hers. And that I would go round to all the Churches in London and We&s;tmin&s;ter, where there were Prayers or Service, from &s;un-ri&s;e to &s;un-&s;et, and haunt their hou&s;e like a gho&s;t, till I had the op|portunity my &s;oul panted after.</P>
<P>This I bid them tell her. And thus ended our &s;erious conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>I took leave of them, and went down; and, &s;tepping into my chair, cau&s;ed my&s;elf to be carried to Lincoln's-Inn; and walked in the gardens till Chapel was opened; and then I went in, and &s;taid prayers, in hopes of &s;eeing the dear creature enter: But to no purpo&s;e; and yet I prayed mo&s;t devoutly that &s;he might be conducted thither, either by my good angel, or her own. And indeed I burn more than ever with impatience to be once more permitted to kneel at the feet of this adorable woman. And had I met her, or &s;py'd her in the Chapel, it is my firm belief, that I &s;hould not have been able (tho' it had been in the mid&s;t of the Sacred Office, and in the pre&s;ence of thou&s;ands) to have forborne pro&s;tration to her, and even clamorous &s;upplication for her forgivene&s;s: A Chri&s;tian act; the ex|erci&s;e of it therefore worthy of the place.</P>
<P><PB N="405" REF="406">After Service was over, I &s;tept into my chair again, and once more was carried to Smith's, in hopes I might have &s;urprized her there: But no &s;uch happine&s;s for thy friend. I &s;taid in the back-&s;hop an hour and half, by my watch; and again underwent a good deal of preachment from the women. John was mainly civil to me now; won over a little by my &s;erious talk, and the honour I profe&s;&s;ed for the lady; and they all three wi&s;hed matters could be made up between us: But &s;till in&s;i&s;ted, that &s;he could never get over her illne&s;s; and that her heart was broken. A cue, I &s;uppo&s;e, they had from you.</P>
<P>While I was there, a letter was brought for her by a particular hand. They &s;eemed very &s;olicitous to hide it from me; which made me &s;u&s;pect it was for her. I de|&s;ired to be &s;uffered to ca&s;t an eye upon the &s;eal, and the &s;uper&s;cription; promi&s;ing to give it back to them un|opened.</P>
<P>Looking upon it, I told them, I knew the hand and &s;eal. It was from her &s;i&s;ter <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. <HI>V.I.</HI> p. <HI>52.</HI></NOTE>. And I hoped it would bring her news that &s;he would be plea&s;ed with.</P>
<P>They joined mo&s;t heartily in the &s;ame hope: And give|ing the letter to them again, I civilly took my leave, and went away.</P>
<P>But I will be there again pre&s;ently; for I fancy my courteous behaviour to the&s;e women, will, on their report of it, procure me the favour I &s;o earne&s;tly covet. And &s;o I will leave my letter un&s;ealed, to tell thee the event of my next vi&s;it at Smith's.</P>
<P>THY &s;ervant ju&s;t calling. I &s;end thee this. And will &s;oon follow it by another. Mean time, I long to hear how poor Belton is. To whom my be&s;t wi&s;hes.</P>
