<HEAD>A LETTER, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Burlington,</HI> <DATE><HI>Dec.</HI> 16, 1794.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>MY DEAR FRIEND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have not been able before this time to &s;end you a letter which would be &s;atisfactory to you; and I am very appre|hen&s;ive the hurry of removing to this place, and putting things in a little order, will render this very incomplete.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the Voyage, I mu&s;t ad|vi&s;e all my friends who de&s;ign to under|take it, to expect it will be attended with many uncomfortable circum&s;tances. Were I to cro&s;s the Atlantic again with a party
<PB N="2" REF="4">of my friends, I would mo&s;t certainly lay in my own &s;tock of provi&s;ions, and have, in a great degree, the &s;uperintendance of their cooking; as the enjoyment of the food de|pends fully as much on the mode of pre|paring it for the meals, as upon its good|ne&s;s. I do a&s;&s;ure you, that, although I was not &s;ea-&s;ick once during the voyage, my &s;tomach was rendered &s;o delicate by the &s;tate of the meat when put on the table, that I &s;carcely made one good meal. All &s;orts of fruit are mo&s;t highly grateful, particularly to the &s;ick. The very &s;mall variety which is found on board &s;hip, makes it of va&s;t con&s;equence to have a plea&s;ant company, and mo&s;t of all a cheer|ful, good-humoured captain, who will contribute more to moderate the tediou&s;|ne&s;s of the voyage, than all other circum|&s;tances put together; and this for many obvious rea&s;ons; but, particularly, becau&s;e he will &s;atisfy the minds of tho&s;e, who,
<PB N="3" REF="5">being unu&s;ed to the &s;ea, will be perpe|tually imagining danger where it does not exi&s;t. Books of the mo&s;t trifling kind are the mo&s;t u&s;eful: tho&s;e which require much attention cannot be read. I have &s;uch an idea of the &s;afene&s;s of the voyage, in a good &s;hip, managed by a captain of good &s;en&s;e, that I &s;hould have no apprehen&s;ion of danger in undertaking it. I &s;hould dread nothing but feelings which are al|ways excited by great tediou&s;ne&s;s and want of variety; the unplea&s;antne&s;s of which it is not in my power to de&s;cribe. The &s;ea|&s;ickne&s;s is by no means to be feared; in general it pa&s;&s;es off in a few days; and where it continues, it is rather u&s;eful than otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>On your arrival at Philadelphia you are not to expect accommodations at taverns as in England. The &s;itting rooms are public; and you are expected on the day of your arrival to procure your&s;elf lod|gings.
<PB N="4" REF="6">The lodgings are exceedingly ex|travagant, from &s;ix to ten dollars each per&s;on per week: the table but mode|rate; and the beverage, porter, or rum-and-water. Hou&s;e-rent in Philadelphia is much higher than in Bri&s;tol; hou&s;e-keep|ing much dearer; the wages of the mo&s;t ignorant &s;ervants not le&s;s than a dollar a week; and the&s;e very difficultly to be procured.</P>
<P>When I left England, you know, my in|clinations led me to the projecled &s;ettle|ment on the Loyal Sock Creek, in the north-we&s;t part of Penn&s;ylvania. How|ever, as I thought it po&s;&s;ible we had re|ceived our accounts of this land from per|&s;ons who were in &s;ome degree intere&s;ted, you recollect I was not very &s;anguine re|&s;pecting it; but had re&s;olved to examine for my&s;elf into the &s;tate of the land in this country. When we arrived at Philadel|phia, we were informed the &s;cheme was
<PB N="5" REF="7">given up; which di&s;appointed us all very much. The &s;tate of the ca&s;e was this:&mdash; Mr. C. when he was here before, and other gentlemen, were of opinion, that it would be very de&s;irable for Engli&s;h emi|grants to have an a&s;ylum in this country, where it might be in their power to &s;up|port them&s;elves and families, upon land which would be &s;old at &s;o cheap a rate as to be within the reach of per&s;ons of the &s;malle&s;t property. Mr. R. had made a purcha&s;e of a con&s;iderable tract of land near the Loyal Sock; Mr. P. had made a &s;imilar one; but, in order to render the plan complete, it was nece&s;&s;ary to add &s;o much more to what they had purcha&s;ed as would rai&s;e the whole amount to about 300,000 acres; le&s;s than which they thought would not be &s;ufficient for an Engli&s;h &s;et|tlement. Mr. C. and the other gentlemen applied to Me&s;&s;rs. Morris and Nichol&s;on, who are the principal proprietors of land
<PB N="6" REF="8">in that &s;tate, and who were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the land adjoining the purcha&s;ed tracts. A contract: was entered into for the quan|tity of land which was wanted, on con|dition it &s;hould prove, upon examination, to be, what they &s;aid it was, good land: This was the &s;tage of the bu&s;ine&s;s when Mr. C. returned to England; and upon this he acted; taking it for granted no|thing could occur to fru&s;trate the &s;cheme. However, after his departure, Me&s;&s;rs. P. and H. with &s;urveyors, &amp;c. went over the land, and found a great part of it &s;toney and bad. Me&s;&s;rs. H. returned to Phila|delphia exceedingly di&s;&s;atisfied, and gave up the &s;cheme. But as many thou&s;and acres were already in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Me&s;&s;rs. R. and P. which would accommo|date a great number of families, and could be had at prime co&s;t, which was one dollar per acre, &s;ome friends joined me in think|ing it de&s;irable to vi&s;it the&s;e tracts; as well
<PB N="7" REF="9">for the purpo&s;e of judging for our&s;elves re&s;pecting them, as of having an oppor|tunity of examining the mo&s;t eligible &s;itua|tions in Penn&s;ylvania, which we were in|formed would pre&s;ent them&s;elves to us in the cour&s;e of this journey.</P>
<P>Having &s;tayed a few days in Philadel|phia for the purpo&s;e of purcha&s;ing a hor&s;e each, we &s;et off on the 16th of October. We travelled near the Schuylkill, through Norris-Town, Reading, Hamburgh, and over the Blue Mountains to Sunbury; which was a journey of about 130 miles. We &s;aw a great deal of very excellent land, and much exceedingly bad. Near the towns the price is from &s;ix to fifteen pounds per acre,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When I mention money, I mean Engli&s;h money.</NOTE> with improvements, &s;uch as a wooden hou&s;e, barn, and a few acres cleared and fenced. At a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the Schuylkill and from the towns, it may
<PB N="8" REF="10">be had from nine &s;hillings to three or four pounds. The produce of the land is not readily taken to market; the greater part of it having no navigable river near it, and the Schuylkill it&s;elf being, as yet, imper|fectly &s;o.</P>
<P>The &s;er&s;ations which I every moment experienced from the view of &s;o beautiful a country, were infinitely more delightful than any Engli&s;h pro&s;pect ever produced in me. There was &s;omething &s;o peculiarly &s;triking and grand in the appearance of a country con&s;i&s;ting of &s;mall hills and pro|digious woods, with here and there a cul|tivated &s;pot, that I, who have never been very guilty of enthu&s;ia&s;m, felt what I &s;up|po&s;e people of ta&s;te commonly call rap|tures. But whether this be the proper term for my feelings mu&s;t be left to per|&s;ons of refinement to determine. I dare not be po&s;itive.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="11">For the two la&s;t days, except within a few miles of Sunbury, we &s;aw &s;carcely any thing but woods; and tho&s;e of little value, either for timber or &s;oil, being &s;o di&s;tant. from a market. Sunbury is a pretty, popu|lous town, on the banks of the Su&s;que|hanna: it has &s;everal good taverns. About a mile from Sunbury is the ferry by which we pa&s;&s;ed to Northumberland. This town is &s;ituated much more plea&s;antly than any town I ever &s;aw. It lies exactly in what. are called the Forks of the Su&s;quehanna; that is, where that river divides into the we&s;t and north-ea&s;t branches. The land gently ri&s;es from the river till it forms a &s;mall hill; the town on this account being a good deal elevated above the &s;urface of the water, gives a view of the two branches of the grand Su&s;quehanna below them, and of a divi&s;ion of the north-ea&s;t branch, pro|duced by a large I&s;;land which is &s;ituated near the Forks. It has al&s;o in view the
<PB N="10" REF="12">whole of the town of Sunbury, and of the hills on the other &s;ide of both branches of the river; the appearance of which, con|&s;i&s;ting of various kinds of trees, but parti|cularly of pine, is uncommonly romantic. The town is not a goad one; the hou&s;es are mo&s;tly built of wood. We vi&s;ited Dr. Prie&s;tley, who rents a wooden hou&s;e in this place. The Doctor was in very good &s;pirits: his appearance is con&s;iderably younger than when I &s;aw him before; which effect perhaps is produced by his being without a wig. He rejoices much &s;trong affection for it, on account of his friends there; and hinted to us a de&s;ire to vi&s;it it after the troubles in Europe are over. He was much di&s;appointed in find|ing P. had changed his coat, as he had provided an unitarian chapel for him at New-York : he is now at a lo&s;s for one who has zeal enough to undertake it. The
<PB N="11" REF="13">Doctor has made a purcha&s;e of land ad|joining the town, upon which he is build|ing a hou&s;e.</P>
<P>It being our wi&s;h as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible to vi&s;it the Loyal Sock woods, we furni&s;hed our&s;elves with additional blankets, provi|&s;ion, &amp;c. and &s;tarted after a delightful ride on the we&s;t branch, through the Chili&s;|quaque valley. We reached Muncy, from whence we intended to &s;ally forth into the woods; but heavy rain coming on, and continuing for many hours, rendered it un&s;afe to &s;leep on the ground. The land in that neighbourhood is good, and the average price of it nearly the &s;ame as of what we had before &s;een.</P>
<P>Being de&s;irous of &s;eeing a new &s;ettle|ment, to enable us to decide, on our return from the woods, whether we would ven|ture to commence one our&s;elves, we were informed that there was a French one on the north-ea&s;t branch of the Su&s;quehanna,
<PB N="12" REF="14">which had been begun exactly one year; the di&s;tance of which from Northumber|land was 150 miles. Upon this journey we immediately determined, and ordered a guide to meet us at the &s;ettlement, in order to conduct us through the Loyal Sock woods. We &s;et off on the north-ea&s;t branch, and in five days arrived at the &s;ettlement. In the cour&s;e of this journey we met with much wor&s;e and more dan|gerous roads than I ever &s;aw. The accom|modations al&s;o, with re&s;pect to &s;leeping, wretched indeed. Eating, as in every part of Penn&s;ylvania, pretty good: excellent veni&s;on often pre&s;enting it&s;elf three times a day. It was on this journey I fir&s;t &s;lept on the floor, on &s;traw, in the &s;ame room with all the family, in a log-hou&s;e, much expo&s;ed to air, after a complete wetting and great fatigue, and with no other cor|dial than a good fire at my feet, and a draught of milk and water. On this route
<PB N="13" REF="15">al&s;o we lo&s;t our way in the woods at night, in a violent &s;hower of rain; on which oc|ca&s;ion our terror was great, having no guide, and no pro&s;pect of any thing but wandering among&s;t wild bea&s;ts the whole of the night. The only re&s;ource we had, was for us all to join in a loud outcry, hoping it might be heard by per&s;ons who would lead us into the right road, which very happily &s;ucceeded. On the next morn|ing we reached the town of the &s;ettlement, called French-Town, upon the banks of the Su&s;quehanna. This &s;ettlement is &s;ituated (as you may &s;ee in Howel's map of Penn|&s;ylvania) in a bend of the river, a little below a place called Standing-Stone. It was e&s;tabli&s;hed by &s;everal wealthy French men, mo&s;t of whom had belonged to the con&s;tituent a&s;&s;embly of France; &s;uch as Noailles, Talon, Blacon, Tallerand, &amp;c. who have &s;pared no expence to accommo|date the &s;ettlers with all kinds of con|veniencies;
<PB N="14" REF="16">and have, by their prepara|tions, removed the principal difficulties in the way of &s;ettling in &s;uch a &s;ituation. The town has already two very good taverns, one kept by Captain (formerly Baron) Beaulieu; about forty hou&s;es, all of wood, &s;ome very well built; particularly one belonging to Talon, which has &s;ix|teen very good rooms, and one very large one, elegantly furni&s;hed. At this hou&s;e people find welcome on their arrival. Du|ring the three days we &s;pent in the town, we were often invited by Blacon to vi&s;it the party of French ladies and gentlemen who were there. We found them &s;en&s;ible and polite people, and full of mirth and gaiety. We were &s;o much plea&s;ed with them all, that we felt a degree of prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in favour of the &s;ettlement. The extent of the land is about a million of acres; the greate&s;t part of which is exceedingly rich and good. There are already between
<PB N="15" REF="17">three and four hundred families; and their progre&s;s in clearing lands and making roads is really a&s;toni&s;hing. The original price of the land was one dollar per acre; it is now bought at &s;ix &s;hillings. The &s;ettlers are called ari&s;tocrats by the French re|publicans in Philadelphia; but be that as it may, ari&s;tocracy in an American &s;ettle|ment cannot long &s;urvive: the&s;e people have already given up their titles.</P>
<P>From French-Town we &s;et off for the Loyal-Sock creek, near the waters of which we pitched our tents three nights. We built our tabernacles of boughs and leaves; and the weather being fine, we kept our|&s;elves &s;ufficiently warm by means of a pro|digious fire at our feet. We felt very few apprehen&s;ions on account of wild bea&s;ts, as they are very rarely to be met with, and are perfectly harmle&s;s, being terrified by the appearance even of a child.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="18">After encountering very important diffi|culties in this route, from the north-ea&s;t to the we&s;t branch of the Su&s;quehanna, where was nothing but trees and wild bea&s;ts, we again reached the tavern at Muncy, and at length arrived at that tract of land which it was our object to &s;ee. Here we reflected upon the di&s;tance from market, upon a &s;tate of &s;eclu&s;ion from the re&s;t of mankind, and upon &s;ome other circum|&s;tances which appeared to <HI>us</HI> in&s;uperable difficulties in the way of our <HI>commencing</HI> a &s;ettlement. The timber al&s;o, &s;o far from being an object, is &s;o much in the way on account of the prodigious bulk and num|ber of the trees, as to render de&s;truction by fire the only mode of getting rid of them. The trees, which con&s;i&s;t princi|pally of hemlock, a &s;pecies of pine, are from nine to twenty-&s;even feet in circum|ference, and one hundred to one hundred and twenty in height; the oak, the hic|cory,
<PB N="17" REF="19">and the che&s;nut, are not much le&s;s. Be&s;ides, at the commencement of a &s;ettle|ment, it would be nece&s;&s;ary for families to re&s;ide in &s;ome town during the clearing and cultivation of the land; unle&s;s, like the New-Englanders, they had been edu|cated in the&s;e difficulties; or, like the French, they had the greater part of them previ|ou&s;ly removed. But, I mu&s;t own, I &s;hould have been effectually prevented from &s;et|tling there, merely by the improbability of being joined by a &s;ufficient number of companions. Thus determined with re|&s;pect to the Loyal Sock, we returned once more to Northumberland.</P>
<P>As an Engli&s;h &s;ettlement was now out of the que&s;tion, it became nece&s;&s;ary to di|rect our attention to &s;ome other plan of &s;ettling; and it appeared the mo&s;t de&s;irable to look out for &s;ituations which were al|ready in &s;ome degree inhabited. It is pretty generally under&s;tood, that what are called
<PB N="18" REF="20">cultivated lands, (American agriculture being very bad) are exhau&s;ted lands. It was, therefore, our object to find out &s;uch as were partially cleared and cultivated. The neighbourhood of the Forks of the Su&s;quehanna appeared very eligible, on account of the healthfulne&s;s of its &s;itu|ation, and its proximity to &s;o large a river. We then employed our&s;elves in examining the tracts near the town of Northumberland. The land is in part cleared on both branches of the river, within the di&s;tance of eight or ten miles from the town. Within about two miles of the town it is not to be bought under four or five pounds per acre. At a greater di&s;tance, from three to two pounds. The whole of this land is exceedingly good, and fit both for corn and grazing, particularly the latter, on account of its being on the river. The land at the di&s;tance of about two miles from the town, and the &s;ame
<PB N="19" REF="21">from the river, in an uncleared &s;tate, may be bought for a guinea per acre. The ready market both for wood and pro|duce makes this a very de&s;irable &s;itua|tion. The mere article of wood, within three miles of the town, will more than pay all the expences of clearing. This is a very populous neighbourhood.</P>
<P>The expences of this &s;ituation would be nearly the&s;e: 100 acres (which it &s;eems are &s;ufficient) at 3l. per acre, 300l.&mdash;100l. or le&s;s to be advanced at fir&s;t, and the remainder in &s;mall &s;ums, paying legal intere&s;t: but to tho&s;e who can advance the whole, con&s;ider|able allowance is made. Labour is pro|cured at about two &s;hillings a day; but labourers are &s;carce. The hou&s;e and barn would co&s;t about 200l.; and the &s;tock, at fir&s;t, about 100l. Families, while the hou&s;e, &amp;c. are preparing, might be accommodated with hou&s;es, or lodgings, at Northumber|land, at a very moderate rate. Having
<PB N="20" REF="22">gained this information, we lo&s;t no time in &s;etting off again for Philadelphia, with a view to a&s;certain, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, the price of land in other &s;ituations. Having heard much of the land in Lanca&s;ter county, we returned that way; but we were &s;oon &s;atisfied re&s;pecting the land in that and the other counties through which we pa&s;&s;ed; as the price of it was from &s;ix to twenty pounds per acre, even at a con|&s;iderable di&s;tance from the Su&s;quehanna. We reached Philadelphia a fortnight &s;ince, undetermined where to &s;ettle; but, how|ever, highly delighted with our journey. It was a great &s;atisfaction to us to have a&s;certained the value of lands in tho&s;e parts of Penn&s;ylvania, which are mo&s;t eli|gible on account of climate and &s;oil.</P>
<P>Having given you a &s;ort of hi&s;tory of my tour, you will of cour&s;e expect my opinion re&s;pecting the country, &amp;c. and al&s;o an account of my own intentions.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="23">You perceive the <HI>Back Lands,</HI> as they are called, recommend them&s;elves by the cheapne&s;s of their purcha&s;e, and the great probability there is of their being, in the cour&s;e of time, of con&s;iderable value; as all the Penn&s;ylvania lands are now &s;o rapidly ri&s;ing in price, that within the la&s;t two years they have increa&s;ed almo&s;t one-third. The difficulties, however, in the way of &s;ettling in &s;o remote a &s;ituation, are &s;o great, as effectually to deter me from un|dertaking it. The next re&s;ource is to the land in peopled parts of the &s;tate, the price of which, very highly cultivated and well built upon, is &s;o much too high, as not to be at all an object of my attention: the price of 200 acres of &s;uch a de&s;cription is from 2 to 4,000l. It appears that the average price of good land, with little or no improvements, is about 3l. per acre. This is about the price which I think Europeans, unaccu&s;tomed to much labour,
<PB N="22" REF="24">fatigue, and &s;eclu&s;ion from the world, mu&s;t give for that land and that &s;ituation which will render them comfortable and happy: I advi&s;e none of my friends to think of any thing el&s;e. I am al&s;o decidedly of opinion, from what I have &s;een, and from the enquiries I have made, that Penn&s;yl|vania is the mo&s;t healthful &s;tate; and that Northumberland is by far to be preferred to all the other counties of Penn&s;ylvania; as it is more healthful, and better &s;ituated with re&s;pect to the whole of the United States. I have no doubt that the land near the town of Northumberland is in|ferior to none.</P>
<P>Having given you this &s;tatement, you will perceive whither my inclinations lead me. But I have not yet entirely made up my mind. I do &s;incerely a&s;&s;ure you, I have found America infinitely &s;uperior to my ex|pectations. The government, you know, is not &s;trictly republican; yet it is &s;o ad|mirably
<PB N="23" REF="25">admini&s;tered, as mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sfully to con&s;ult the happine&s;s of the people. There have been, it is true, of late, &s;ome &s;erious in&s;urrections in the we&s;tern coun|ties of Penn&s;ylvania, on account of an exci&s;e tax upon whi&s;key, the beverage of the country, which have been happily quelled; but which, I hope, will lead to the repeal and the prevention of all indirect taxes. The United States have al&s;o been lately at war with the Indians; with the circum&s;tances of which bu&s;ine&s;s, I believe, few in England are acquainted; and, therefore, the United States have generally been &s;uppo&s;ed to be the aggrieved party. But you will judge whether they were or not. At the time when the Briti&s;h go|verned this country, the line of &s;eparation between their property and that of the Indians was formed by the we&s;tern waters; that is, the Ohio and Allegany rivers. The Indians having, at that time, much more
<PB N="24" REF="26">land than it was probable they would ever want, a treaty was made between them and the Briti&s;h, in which a pre-emption right to that land was &s;ecured to the Briti&s;h; who, previous to the revolution, made no u&s;e of it. At the end of the American war, however, the Briti&s;h, in their treaty with the United States, guaranteed them the pre-emption right which the Indians had en&s;ured to the Briti&s;h by their treaty. In con&s;equence of this, many &s;ettlements have been formed on the&s;e waters under the protection of this government. But the Indians con&s;idered that the Briti&s;h could, upon no ju&s;t principle, transfer the right from them&s;elves to any others; and mole&s;ted the &s;ettlers to &s;uch a degree as to make it nece&s;&s;ary for them to call upon this government for redre&s;s and protection. The United States immediately went to war with the Indians: the con&s;equence was a treaty, by which they guaranteed the &s;ame
<PB N="25" REF="27">right to the Americans. It is, however, certain that the Briti&s;h did in&s;tigate the Indians to this bu&s;ine&s;s, and did encourage them, by means of &s;upplies of various kinds, to per&s;evere in the war.</P>
<P>Although civil liberty is very great in this country, political parties run pretty high. The Federali&s;t party have much the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition as the Court party in England: however, the Anti-federali&s;ts are too numerous and &s;trong to &s;uffer any en|croachments on the liberties of the people. Both, however, equally rejoice in the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es of the French.</P>
<P>The climate of this country is infinitely &s;uperior to that of England. We have had almo&s;t uniformly fine weather &s;ince we arrived, which was on the 10th of Octo|ber. Such clearne&s;s of the atmo&s;phere I never &s;aw before. And I have felt, what Dr. Prie&s;tley told me he had con&s;tantly ex|perienced, a peculiar &s;tate of the air, which
<PB N="26" REF="28">has invariably kept my &s;pirits higher and more comfortable than I can de&s;cribe. This effect we have all felt. Indeed <HI>I</HI> have good rea&s;on for thinking the air healthful, for I have not had the lea&s;t attack of my complaint &s;ince my arrival.</P>
<P>We know nothing here of religious per|&s;ecution, the mo&s;t dreadful of all evils; as religion, I mean &s;uper&s;tition, is not the favourite pur&s;uit of America; nor is it often the &s;ubject of conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>The American people are very civil, provided you lay a&s;ide European import|ance. So much equality and real inde|pendence I never expected to &s;ee. But the European, who thinks he &s;hall have more ea&s;e in this country than in Europe, will be mo&s;t dreadfully di&s;appointed; as &s;ubor|dination is &s;carcely known here. We are, con&s;equently, obliged to do much for our|&s;elves. I wi&s;h not to &s;ee any of my friends here who would not be plea&s;ed with this
<PB N="27" REF="29">&s;tate of things; as I think they are more happy where they are: for my own part, I like it.</P>
<P>The Americans, it mu&s;t be acknow|ledged, do not exhibit tho&s;e flights of genius which are found in England; but I am &s;ure, as a body, the people of England, in the &s;ame pur&s;uits, have not half their in|formation or good &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>In Philadelphia the expences are much greater than in Bri&s;tol. They are nearly the&s;e in the towns at the di&s;tance of twenty or thirty miles from Philadelphia:&mdash;hou&s;e|rent one-third dearer than in England: &s;ervants wages 3s. per week: beef, mutton, and poultry 4d. per pound: pork 5d.: ba|con and chee&s;e 5&frac12;d.: fre&s;h butter 13&frac12;d.: &s;alt butter 11d.: loaf-&s;ugar 14d.: be&s;t brown &s;ugar 7&frac14;d.: flour 3&frac12;d.: bread 2&frac12;d.: eggs 13&frac12;d. per doz.: wearing apparel of all kinds, one-third dearer than in England: mahogany and other wooden goods, about
<PB N="28" REF="30">the &s;ame price as there: earthen ware and gla&s;s at lea&s;t three times as high: tin ware as dear again: feathers 2s. 8&frac14;d. per pound: wood, which is the article u&s;ed, makes firing twice as dear as in Bri&s;tol: French-brandy from 5s. 6d. to 7s. per gall.: rum from 3s. to 5s.: and whi&s;key, which is a mo&s;t ex|cellent liquor, from 1s. 6d. to 3s.: apple|whi&s;key about the &s;ame price: potatoes 14d. per bu&s;hel: other vegetables much higher than in England: and all articles of luxury very con&s;iderably dearer. I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the articles which are the produce of this country are about one-third cheaper, about 100 or 130 miles from Philadelphia, than at the di&s;tance I have mentioned. At Northumberland families may board for between two and three dollars each per&s;on per week.</P>
<P>You &s;ee from this account, that people are much deceived who imagine the expen|ces of hou&s;e-keeping in America are low.
<PB N="29" REF="31">It is impo&s;&s;ible to be upon a footing with the people here, without being engaged in &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s; every bu&s;ine&s;s is valuable, and none de&s;pi&s;ed; on the contrary, the very appearance of idlene&s;s and want of employment is contemptible.</P>
<P>It follows from what I have &s;aid, that per&s;ons coming into this country with a view to &s;ettle, will be &s;ubject to con&s;iderable expences during the time they are &s;eeking for a &s;ituation; as well as before they re|ceive any produce from their farm, if agri|culture be their object. The&s;e two im|portant inconveniencies would be obviated by commi&s;&s;ioning any friend who may be on the &s;pot to act for them. By the&s;e means they would have a place immediately to re&s;ort to, and the land might be pro|ductive as &s;oon as they arrive. Upon this plan they would not be precluded from changing their &s;ituation whenever they thought proper; as, according to the pre|&s;ent
<PB N="30" REF="32">ri&s;e of lands in price, they would be &s;o far from &s;uffering any lo&s;s, &s;hould they be di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ell, that there is almo&s;t a cer|tainty they would put money into their pockets; at the &s;ame time that their land produces enough to defray the expences of looking about them. There would be an|other advantage, which to me is not tri|fling, they would have a much greater op|portunity of &s;ettling near their friends.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the fertility of Kentucky, we have been ju&s;tly informed in England; but I need not give you a &s;tronger proof of its ineligibility than that I lately &s;aw a letter from Mr. T. of Lexington, in which he &s;ays the heat is &s;o inten&s;e as to oblige him to leave it for Penn&s;ylvania, as &s;oon as his engagements will permit.</P>
<P>The Gene&s;ee has good land in many parts; in an uncleared &s;tate from two to three dollars per acre; but it is generally unhealthful, being much infe&s;ted with in|termittents,
<PB N="31" REF="33">and too di&s;tant from the large towns.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to our &s;afe arrival in Ame|rica, we have rea&s;on to rejoice, as our friends, whom we were to have accom|panied, have been taken into France, which mu&s;t be attended with much inconvenience. We have rea&s;on to expect them &s;oon in America; as a&s;&s;urances of their intentions to re&s;ide here have been &s;ent by the French amba&s;&s;ador to the French government, and al&s;o by Dr. P.</P>
