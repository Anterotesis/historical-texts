<P>GUATIMOZINO, the la&s;t emperour of MEXICO, having op|po&s;ed the SPANIARDS with great bravery, in various en|gagements, was at length defeated and taken pri&s;oner. In order to extort from him a di&s;covery of the principal mines, he was laid on burning coals: The &s;econd in command was al&s;o condemn'd to the &s;ame torture, and amid&s;t his &s;ufferings called upon his royal ma&s;ter to be relea&s;ed from the vow of &s;ecrecy, which drew from GUATIMOZINO the&s;e memo|rable words: <HI>Am I on a Bed of Ro&s;es?</HI></P>
<P>DRYDEN has put the&s;e words into the mouth of MONTEZU|MA contrary to the te&s;timony of the hi&s;torians.</P>
