<HEAD>AN HISTORY OF BIRDS.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of Birds in General.</HEAD>
<P>WE are now come to a beautiful and loqua|cious race of animals,
that embelli&s;h our fore&s;ts, amu&s;e our walks, and exclude &s;olitude from
our mo&s;t &s;hady retirements. From the&s;e man has nothing to fear; their
plea&s;ures, their de&s;ires, and even their animo&s;ities, only &s;erve to
enliven the general picture of Nature, and give har|mony to meditation.</P>
<P>No part of Nature appears de&s;titute of inha|bitants. The
woods, the waters, the depths of the earth, have their re&s;pective tenants;
while the yielding air, and tho&s;e tracts of &s;eeming &s;pace where man never
can a&s;cend, are al&s;o <PB N="2" REF="5"> pa&s;&s;ed through by multitudes of
the mo&s;t beau|tiful beings of the creation.</P>
<P>Every order and rank of animals &s;eems fitted for its
&s;ituation in life; but none more appa|rently than birds; they &s;hare in
common with the &s;tronger race of quadrupedes the vegetable &s;poils of the
earth, are &s;upplied with &s;wiftne&s;s to compen&s;ate for their want of
force; and have a faculty of a&s;cending into the air to avoid that power which
they cannot oppo&s;e.</P>
<P>The bird &s;eems formed entirely for a life of e&s;cape; and
every part of the anatomy of the animal &s;eems calculated for &s;wiftne&s;s.
As it is de&s;igned to ri&s;e upon air, all its parts are pro|portionably
light, and expand a large &s;urface without &s;olidity.</P>
<P>In a comparative view with man, their for|mation &s;eems much
ruder and more imperfect; and they are in general found incapable of the
docility even of quadrupedes. Indeed, what great degree of &s;agacity can be
expected in animals who&s;e eyes are almo&s;t as large as their brain? However,
though they fall below qua|drupedes in the &s;cale of Nature, and are le&s;s
imitative of human endowments; yet they hold the next rank, and far &s;urpa&s;s
fi&s;hes and in&s;ects, both in the &s;tructure of their bodies and in their
&s;agacity.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="6">As in mechanics the mo&s;t curious
in&s;truments are generally the mo&s;t complicated, &s;o it is in anatomy. The
body of man pre&s;ents the greate&s;t variety upon di&s;&s;ection; quadrupedes,
le&s;s per|fectly formed, di&s;cover their defects in the &s;im|plicity of
their conformation; the mechani&s;m of birds is &s;till le&s;s complex;
fi&s;hes are furni&s;hed with fewer organs &s;till; whil&s;t in&s;ects, more
im|perfect than all, &s;eem to fill up the cha&s;m that &s;eparates animal from
vegetable nature. Of man, the mo&s;t perfect animal, there are but three or
four &s;pecies; of quadrupedes, the kinds are more numerous; birds are more
various &s;till; fi&s;hes yet more; but in&s;ects afford &s;o very great a
variety, that they elude the &s;earch of the mo&s;t inqui&s;itive
pur&s;uer.</P>
<P>Quadrupedes, as was &s;aid, have &s;ome di&s;tant re&s;emblance
in their internal &s;tructure with man; but that of birds is entirely
di&s;&s;imilar. As they &s;eem chiefly formed to inhabit the empty re|gions of
air, all their parts are adapted to their de&s;tined &s;ituation. It will be
proper therefore, before I give a general hi&s;tory of birds, to enter into a
&s;light detail of their anatom and con|formation.</P>
<P>As to their external parts, they &s;eem &s;urpriz|ingly adapted
for &s;wiftne&s;s of motion. The &s;hape of their body is &s;harp before, to
pierce and make <PB N="4" REF="7"> way through the air; it then ri&s;es by a
gentle &s;welling to its bulk, and falls off in an expan&s;ive tail, that helps
to keep it buoyant, while the fore-parts are cleaving the air by their
&s;harp|ne&s;s. From this conformation, they have often been compared to a
&s;hip making its way through water; the trunk of the body an&s;wers to the
hold, the head to the prow, the tail to the rudder, and the wings to the oars;
from whence the poets have adopted the metaphor of <HI>remigium alarum,</HI>
when they de&s;cribe the wavy motion of a bird in flight.</P>
<P>What we are called upon next to admire in the external formation
of birds is, the neat po|&s;ition of the feathers, lying all one way,
an|&s;wering at once the purpo&s;es of warmth, &s;peed, and &s;ecurity. They
mo&s;tly tend backward, and are laid over one another in an exact and regular
order, armed with warm and &s;oft down next the body, and more &s;trongly
fortified and curiou&s;ly clo&s;ed externally, to fence off the injuries of the
weather. But, le&s;t the feathers &s;hould &s;poil by their violent attrition
again&s;t the air, or imbibe the moi&s;ture of the atmo&s;phere, the animal is
furni&s;hed with a gland behind, containing a proper quantity of oil, which can
be pre&s;&s;ed out by the bird's bill, and laid &s;moothly over every feather
that wants to be dre&s;&s;ed for the <PB N="5" REF="8"> occa&s;ion. This gland
is &s;ituated on the rump, and furni&s;hed with an opening or excretory duct;
about which grows a &s;mall tuft of feathers, &s;omewhat like a painter's
pencil. When, there|fore, the feathers are &s;hattered or rumpled, the bird,
turning its head backwards, with the bill catches hold of the gland, and,
pre&s;&s;ing it, forces out the oily &s;ub&s;tance, with which it anoints the
disjoined parts of the feathers; and, drawing them out with great
a&s;&s;iduity, recom|po&s;es and places them in due order; by which they unite
more clo&s;ely together. Such poultry, however, as live for the mo&s;t part
under cover, are not furni&s;hed with &s;o large a &s;tock of this fluid as
tho&s;e birds that re&s;ide in the open air. The feathers of an hen, for
in&s;tance, are pervious to every &s;hower; on the con|trary, &s;wans, gee&s;e,
ducks, and all &s;uch as Na|ture has directed to live upon the water, have
their feathers dre&s;&s;ed with oil from the very fir&s;t day of their leaving
the &s;hell. Thus their &s;tock of fluid is equal to the nece&s;&s;ity of its
con|&s;umption. Their very fle&s;h contracts a flavour from it, which renders
it in &s;ome &s;o very rancid, as to make it utterly unfit for food; however,
though it injures the fle&s;h, it improves the feathers for all the dome&s;tic
purpo&s;es to which they are u&s;ually converted.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="9">Nor are the feathers with which birds are
covered le&s;s an object of admiration. The &s;haft of every feather is made
proportionably &s;trong; but hollow below for &s;trength and lightne&s;s, and
above filled with a pith to feed the growth of vane or beard that &s;prings
from the &s;haft of the feather on either &s;ide. All the&s;e feathers are
placed generally according to their length and &s;trength, &s;o that the
large&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t feathers in flight have the greate&s;t &s;hare of
duty. The vane, or beard of the feather, is formed with equal contrivance and
care. It con&s;i&s;ts not of one continued membrane; becau&s;e, if this were
broken, it could not ea&s;ily be repaired; but it is compo&s;ed of many layers,
each &s;ome|what in it&s;elf re&s;embling a feather, and lying again&s;t each
other in clo&s;e conjunction. To|wards the &s;haft of the feather, the&s;e
layers are broad, and of a &s;emicircular form, to &s;erve for &s;trength, and
for the clo&s;er grafting them one again&s;t another when in action. Towards
the outer part of the vane, the&s;e layers grow &s;lender and taper to be more
light. On their under &s;ide they are thin and &s;mooth, but their upper outer
edge is parted into two hairy edges, each &s;ide having a different &s;ort of
hairs, broad at bottom, and &s;lender and bearded above. By this mechani&s;m,
the hooked beards of one layer <PB N="7" REF="10"> always lye next the
&s;traight beards of the next, and by that means lock and hold each other.</P>
<P>The next object that comes under con&s;idera|tion in
contemplating an animal that flies, is the wing, the in&s;trument by which this
wonderful progre&s;&s;ion is performed. In &s;uch birds as fly, they are
u&s;ually placed at that part of the body which &s;erves to poize the whole,
and &s;upport it in a fluid that at fir&s;t &s;eems &s;o much lighter than
it&s;elf. They an&s;wer to the fore-legs in quadrupedes, and at the extremity
of this they have a certain finger-like appendix, which is u&s;ually called the
<HI>ba&s;tard-wing.</HI> This in&s;trument of flight is furni&s;hed with
quills, which differ from the common feathers only in their &s;ize being
larger, and al&s;o from their &s;pringing from the deeper part of the &s;kin,
their &s;hafts lying al|mo&s;t clo&s;e to the bone. The beards of the&s;e
quills are broad on one &s;ide and more narrow on the other, both which
contribute to the pro|gre&s;&s;ive motion of the bird and the clo&s;ene&s;s of
the wing. The manner in which mo&s;t birds avail them&s;elves of the&s;e is
fir&s;t thus: they quit the earth with a bound, in order to have room for
flapping with the wing; when they have room for this, they &s;trike the body of
air beneath the wing with a violent motion, and with the whole under &s;urface
of the &s;ame; but <PB N="8" REF="11"> then, to avoid &s;triking the air with
equal vio|lence on the upper &s;ide as they ri&s;e, the wing is in&s;tantly
contracted; &s;o that the animal ri&s;es by the impul&s;e till it &s;preads the
wing for a &s;econd blow. For this rea&s;on, we always &s;ee birds chu&s;e to
ri&s;e again&s;t the wind, becau&s;e they have thus a greater body of air on
the under than the upper &s;ide of the wing. For the&s;e rea&s;ons al&s;o large
fowls do not ri&s;e ea&s;ily, both becau&s;e they have not &s;ufficient room at
fir&s;t for the motion of their wings, and becau&s;e the body of air does not
lie &s;o directly under the wing as they ri&s;e.</P>
<P>In order to move the wings, all birds are furni&s;hed with two
very &s;trong pectoral mu&s;cles, which lie on each &s;ide of the
brea&s;t-bone. The pectoral mu&s;cles of quadrupedes are trifling in
compari&s;on to tho&s;e of birds. In quadrupedes, as well as in man, the
mu&s;cles which move the thighs and hinder parts of the body are by far the
&s;tronge&s;t, while tho&s;e of the arms are feeble; but in birds, which make
u&s;e of their wings, the contrary obtains; the pectoral mu&s;cles that move
the wings or arms are of enormous &s;trength, while tho&s;e of the thighs are
weak and &s;lender. By means of the&s;e, a bird can move its wings with a
degree of &s;trength which, when compared to the animal's &s;ize, is 
<PB N="9" REF="12"> almo&s;t incredible. The flap of a &s;wan's wing would
break a man's leg; and a &s;imilar blow from an eagle has been known to lay a
man dead in an in&s;tant. Such, con&s;equently, is the force of the wing, and
&s;uch its lightne&s;s, as to be inimitable by art. No machines that human
&s;kill can contrive are capable of giving &s;uch force to &s;o light an
apparatus. The art of flying, therefore, that has &s;o often and &s;o
fruitle&s;sly been &s;ought after, mu&s;t, it is feared, for ever be
unattainable; &s;ince as man encrea&s;es the force of his flying machine, he
mu&s;t be obliged to encrea&s;e its weight al&s;o.</P>
<P>In all birds, except nocturnal ones, the head is &s;maller, and
bears le&s;s proportion to the body than in quadrupedes, that it may more
readily divide the air in flying, and make way for the body, &s;o as to render
its pa&s;&s;age more ea&s;y. Their eyes al&s;o are more flat and depre&s;&s;ed
than in quadrupedes; a circle of &s;mall plates of bone, placed &s;calewi&s;e,
under the outer coat of the organ, encompa&s;&s;es the pupil on each, to
&s;trengthen and defend it from injuries. Be&s;ide this, birds have a kind of
&s;kin, called the nictitating membrane, with which, like a veil, they can at
plea&s;ure cover their eyes, though their eyelids continue open. This membrane
takes its ri&s;e from the greater or <PB N="10" REF="13"> more obtu&s;e corner
of the eye, and &s;erves to wipe, clean&s;e, and probably to moi&s;ten its
&s;ur|face. The eyes, though they outwardly appear but &s;mall, yet
&s;eparately, each almo&s;t equals the brain; whereas in man the brain is more
than twenty times larger than the orbit of the eye. Nor is this organ in birds
le&s;s adapted for vi&s;ion by a particular expan&s;ion of the optic nerve,
which renders the impre&s;&s;ions of external objects more vivid and
di&s;tinct.</P>
<P>From this conformation of the eye it follows, that the &s;en&s;e
of &s;eeing in birds is infinitely &s;uperior to that of other animals. Indeed,
this piercing &s;ight &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to the crea|ture's &s;upport and
&s;afety. Were this organ blunter, from the rapidity of the bird's motion, it
would be apt to &s;trike again&s;t every object in its way; and it could
&s;carcely find &s;ub&s;i&s;tence unle&s;s po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a power to
di&s;cern its food from above with a&s;toni&s;hing &s;agacity. An hawk, for
in&s;tance, perceives a lark at a di|&s;tance which neither men nor dogs could
&s;py; a kite, from an almo&s;t imperceptible height in the clouds, darts down
on its prey with the mo&s;t unerring aim. The &s;ight of birds, therefore,
exceeds what we know in mo&s;t other animals, and excels them both in
&s;trength and pre|ci&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="14">All birds want the external ear &s;tanding
out from the head; they are only furni&s;hed with holes that convey &s;ounds to
the auditory ca|nal. It is true, indeed, that the horned owl, and one or two
more birds, &s;eem to have ex|ternal ears; but what bears that re&s;emblance
are only feathers &s;ticking out on each &s;ide of the head, but no way
nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;en&s;e of hearing. It is probable, however, that the
feathers encompa&s;&s;ing the ear-holes in birds &s;upply the defect of the
exterior ear, and collect &s;ounds to be tran&s;mitted to the internal
&s;en&s;ory. The extreme delicacy of this organ is ea&s;ily proved by the
readine&s;s with which birds learn tunes, or repeat words, and the great
exactne&s;s of their pronunciation.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;e of &s;melling &s;eems not le&s;s vivid in the
generality of birds. Many of them <HI>wind</HI> their prey at an immen&s;e
di&s;tance, while others are equally protected by this &s;en&s;e again&s;t
their in&s;idious pur&s;uers. In decoys, where ducks are caught, the men who
attend them univer|&s;ally keep a piece of turf burning near their mouths, upon
which they breathe, le&s;t the fowl &s;hould &s;mell them, and con&s;equently
fly away. The univer&s;ality of this practice puts the nece&s;|&s;ity of it
beyond a doubt, and proves the ex|treme delicacy of the &s;en&s;e of
&s;melling, at lea&s;t in this &s;pecies of the feathered creation.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="15">Next to the parts for flight, let us view
the legs and feet mini&s;tring to motion. They are both made light for the
ea&s;ier tran&s;portation through the air. The toes in &s;ome are webbed, to
fit them for the waters; in others they are &s;eparate, for the better holding
objects, or clinging to trees for &s;afety. Such as have long legs have al&s;o
long necks, as otherwi&s;e they would be incapable of gathering up their food,
either by land or water. But it does not hold, however, that tho&s;e who have
long necks &s;hould have long legs, &s;ince we &s;ee that &s;wans and gee&s;e,
who&s;e necks are extremely long, have very &s;hort legs, and the&s;e chiefly
employed in &s;wimming.</P>
<P>Thus every external part hitherto noticed ap|pears adapted to
the life and &s;ituation of the animal; nor are the inward parts, though le&s;s
immediately appropriated to flight, le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to &s;afety. The bones
of every part of the body are extremely light and thin; and all the mu&s;cles,
except that immediately moving the wings, extremely &s;light and feeble. The
tail, which is compo&s;ed of quill feathers, &s;erves to counterbalance the
head and neck, it guides the animal's flight like a rudder, and greatly
a&s;&s;i&s;ts it either in its a&s;cent or when de|&s;cending.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="16">If we go on to examine birds internally, we
&s;hall find the &s;ame wonderful conformation fit|ting them for a life in air,
and encrea&s;ing the &s;urface by dimini&s;hing the &s;olidity. In the fir&s;t
place, their lungs, which are commonly called the &s;ole, &s;tick fa&s;t to the
&s;ides of the ribs and back, and can be very little diluted or con|tracted.
But to make up for this, which might impede their breathing, the ends of the
branches of the wind-pipe open into them, while the&s;e have openings into the
cavity of the belly, and convey the air drawn in by breathing into certain
receptacles like bladders, running along the length of the whole body. Nor are
the&s;e openings ob&s;cure, or difficult to be di&s;cerned; for a probe
thru&s;t into the lungs of a fowl will ea&s;ily find a pa&s;&s;age into the
belly; and air blown into the wind-pipe will be &s;een to di&s;tend the
animal's body like a bladder. In quadru|pedes this pa&s;&s;age is &s;topped by
the midriff; but in fowls the communication is obvious; and con&s;equently they
have a much greater fa|cility of taking a long and large in&s;piration. It is
&s;ometimes al&s;o &s;een that the wind-pipe makes many convolutions within the
body of the bird, and it is then called the labyrinth; but of what u&s;e
the&s;e convolutions are, or why the wind-pipe &s;hould make &s;o many turnings
<PB N="14" REF="17"> within the body of &s;ome birds, is a difficulty for which
no naturali&s;t has been able to account.</P>
<P>This difference of the wind-pipe often ob|tains in animals that
to all appearance are of the &s;ame &s;pecies. Thus in the tame &s;wan, the
wind-pipe makes but a &s;traight pa&s;&s;age into the lungs; while in the wild
&s;wan, which to all ex|ternal appearance &s;eems the &s;ame animal, the
wind-pipe pierces through the brea&s;t-bone, and there has &s;everal turnings,
before it comes out again and goes to enter the lungs. It is not to form the
voice that the&s;e turnings are found, &s;ince the fowls that are without them
are vocal; and tho&s;e, particularly the bird ju&s;t now mentioned, that have
them, are &s;ilent. Whence therefore, &s;ome birds derive that loud and various
modulation in their warblings is not ea&s;ily to be accounted for; at lea&s;t,
the knife of the anatomi&s;t goes but a &s;hort way in the inve&s;tigation. All
we are cer|tain of, is, that birds have much louder voices, in re&s;pect to
their bulk, than animals of any other kind; for the bellowing of an ox is not
louder than the &s;cream of a peacock.</P>
<P>In the&s;e particulars, birds pretty much re|&s;emble each other
in their internal conforma|tion; but there are &s;ome varieties which we
&s;hould more attentively ob&s;erve. All birds have, properly &s;peaking, but
one &s;tomach; <PB N="15" REF="18"> but this is very different in different
kinds. In all the rapacious kinds that live upon animal food, as well as in
&s;ome of the fi&s;h-feeding tribe, the &s;tomach is peculiarly formed. The
oe&s;o|phagus, or gullet, in them is found replete with glandulous bodies,
which &s;erves to dilate and macerate the food as it pa&s;&s;es into the
&s;to|mach, which is always very large in proportion to the &s;ize of the bird,
and generally wrapped round with fat, in order to encrea&s;e its warmth and
powers of dige&s;tion.</P>
<P>Granivorous birds, or &s;uch as live upon fruits, corn, and
other vegetables, have their inte&s;tines differently formed from tho&s;e of
the rapacious kind. Their gullet dilates ju&s;t above the brea&s;t-bone, and
forms it&s;elf into a pouch or bag, called the crop. This is replete with
&s;alivary glands, which &s;erve to moi&s;ten and &s;often the grain and other
food which it contains. The&s;e glands are very numerous, with longitudinal
openings, which emit a whiti&s;h and a vi&s;cous &s;ub&s;tance. After the dry
food of the bird has been macerated for a convenient time, it then pa&s;&s;es
into the belly, where, in&s;tead of a &s;oft moi&s;t &s;tomach, as in the
rapacious kinds, it is ground between two pair of mu&s;cles, commonly called
the gizzard, covered on the in&s;ide with a &s;tony ridgy coat, and almo&s;t
cartilaginous. <PB N="16" REF="19"> The&s;e coats, rubbing again&s;t each
other, are capable of brui&s;ing and attenuating the harde&s;t &s;ub&s;tances,
their action being often compared to that of the grinding-teeth in man and
other animals. Thus the organs of dige&s;tion are in a manner rever&s;ed in
birds. Bea&s;ts grind their food with their teeth, and then it pa&s;&s;es into
the &s;tomach, where it is &s;oftened and di|ge&s;ted. On the contrary, birds
of this &s;ort fir&s;t macerate and &s;often it in the crop, and then it it is
ground and comminuted in the &s;tomach or gizzard. Birds are al&s;o careful to
pick up &s;and, gravel, and other hard &s;ub&s;tances, not to grind their food,
as has been &s;uppo&s;ed, but to prevent the too violent action of the coats of
the &s;tomach again&s;t each other.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t birds have two appendices or blind guts, which in
quadrupedes are always found &s;ingle. Among &s;uch birds as are thus
&s;upplied, all carnivorous fowl, and all birds of the &s;par|row kind, have
very &s;mall and &s;hort ones: water-fowl, and birds of the poultry kind, the
longe&s;t of all. There is &s;till another appendix ob&s;ervable in the
inte&s;tines of birds, re&s;embling a little worm, which is nothing more than
the remainder of that pa&s;&s;age by which the yolk was conveyed into the guts
of the young chicken, while yet in the egg and under incu|bation.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="20">The outlet of that duct which conveys the
bile into the inte&s;tines is, in mo&s;t birds, a great way di&s;tant from the
&s;tomach; which may ari&s;e from the danger there would be of the bile
re|gurgitating into the &s;tomach in their various rapid motions, as we &s;ee
in men at &s;ea; where|fore their biliary duct is &s;o contrived, that this
regurgitation cannot take place.</P>
<P>All birds, though they want a bladder for urine, have large
kidneys and ureters, by which this &s;ecretion is made, and carried away by one
common canal. 
<Q REND="inline">"Birds," &s;ays Harvey, "as well as &s;erpents,
which have &s;pongy lungs, make but little water, becau&s;e they drink but
little. They, therefore, have no need of a bladder; but their urine di&s;tils
down into the common canal, de&s;igned for receiving the other excrements of
the body. The urine of birds differs from that of other animals; for, as there
is u&s;ually in urine two parts, one more &s;erous and liquid, the other more
thick and gro&s;s, which &s;ub&s;ides to the bottom; in birds, this part is
mo&s;t abundant, and is di|&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t by its white or
&s;ilver colour. This part is found not only in the whole inte&s;tinal canal,
but is &s;een al&s;o in the whole channel of the ureters, which may be
di&s;tingui&s;hed from the coats of the kidneys <PB N="18" REF="21"> by their
whitene&s;s. This milky &s;ub&s;tance they have in greater plenty than the more
thin and &s;erous part; and it is of a middle con&s;i&s;tence, between limpid
urine and the gro&s;&s;er parts of the faeces. In pa&s;&s;ing through the
ureters, it re&s;embles milk curdled or lightly conden&s;ed; and, being ca&s;t
forth ea&s;ily, congeals into a chalky cru&s;t."</Q></P>
<P>From this &s;imple conformation of the animal, it &s;hould
&s;eem that birds are &s;ubject to few di&s;|ea&s;es; and, in fact, they have
but few. There is one, however, which they are &s;ubject to, from which
quadrupedes are in a great mea&s;ure exempt: this is the annual molting which
they &s;uffer; for all birds what&s;oever obtain a new covering of feathers
once a year, and ca&s;t the old. During the molting &s;ea&s;on, they ever
appear di&s;ordered; tho&s;e mo&s;t remarkable for their courage then lo&s;e
all their fiercene&s;s; and &s;uch as are of a weakly con&s;titution often
expire under this natural operation. No feeding can maintain their &s;trength;
they all cea&s;e to breed at this &s;ea&s;on; that nouri&s;hment which goes to
the production of the young is wholly ab&s;orbed by the demand required for
&s;upplying the na|&s;cent plumage.</P>
<P>This molting time, however, may be arti|ficially accelerated;
and tho&s;e who have the <PB N="19" REF="22"> management of &s;inging birds
frequently put their &s;ecret in practice. They enclo&s;e the bird in a dark
cage, where they keep it exce&s;&s;ively warm, and throw the poor little animal
into an artificial fever; this produces the molt; his old feathers fall before
their time, and a new &s;et take place, more brilliant and beautiful than the
former. They add, that it mends the bird's &s;inging, and encrea&s;es its
vivacity; but it mu&s;t not be concealed, that &s;carce one bird in three
&s;urvives the operation.</P>
<P>The manner in which Nature performs this operation of molting is
thus: the quill or fea|ther, when fir&s;t protruded from the &s;kin and come to
its full &s;ize, grows harder as it grows older, and receives a kind of
perio&s;teum or &s;kin round the &s;haft by which it &s;eems attached to the
animal. In proportion as the quill grows older, its &s;ides, or the bony pen
part, thicken; but its whole diameter &s;hrinks and decrea&s;es. Thus, by the
thickening of its &s;ides, all nou|ri&s;hment from the body becomes more
&s;paring; and, by the decrea&s;e of its diameter, it becomes more loo&s;ely
fixed in its &s;ocket, till at length it falls out. In the mean time, the
rudiments of an incipient quill are beginning below. The &s;kin forms it&s;elf
into a little bag, which is fed <PB N="20" REF="23"> from the body by a &s;mall
vein and artery, and which every day encrea&s;es in &s;ize till it is
pro|truded. While the one end vegetates into the beard or vane of the feather,
that part attached to the &s;kin is &s;till &s;oft, and receives a con&s;tant
&s;upply of nouri&s;hment, which is diffu&s;ed through the body of the quill by
that little light &s;ub&s;tance which we always find within when we make a pen.
This &s;ub&s;tance, which as yet has received no name that I know of, &s;erves
the growing quill as the umbilical artery does an infant in the womb, by
&s;upplying it with nouri&s;hment, and diffu&s;ing that nouri&s;hment over the
whole frame. When, however, the quill is come to its full growth, and requires
no further nou|ri&s;hment, the vein and artery become le&s;s and le&s;s, till
at la&s;t the little opening by which they communicated with the quill becomes
wholly obliterated; and the quill thus deprived con|tinues in its &s;ocket for
&s;ome months, till in the end it &s;hrinks, and leaves room for a repetition
of the &s;ame proce&s;s of nature as before.</P>
<P>The molting &s;ea&s;on commonly obtains from the end of &s;ummer
to the middle of autumn. The bird continues to &s;truggle with this malady
during the winter, and Nature has kindly pro|vided, that when there are the
fewe&s;t pro|vi&s;ions, <PB N="21" REF="24"> that then the animal's appetite
&s;hall be lea&s;t craving. At the beginning of &s;pring, when food begins
again to be plenty, the ani|mal's &s;trength and vigour return. It is then that
the abundance of provi&s;ions, aided by the mildne&s;s of the &s;ea&s;on,
incite it to love, and all Nature &s;eems teeming with life, and di&s;po&s;ed
to continue it.</P>

<PB N="22" REF="25">
<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the Generation, Ne&s;tling and Incubation of
Birds.</HEAD>
<P>THE return of &s;pring is the beginning of plea&s;ure. Tho&s;e
vital &s;pirits which &s;eemed locked up during the winter, then begin to
expand; vegetables and in&s;ects &s;upply abundance of food; and the bird
having more than a &s;ufficiency for its own &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, is impelled to
transfu&s;e life as well as to maintain it. Tho&s;e warblings which had been
hu&s;hed during the colder &s;ea&s;ons, now begin to animate the fields; every
grove and bu&s;h re&s;ounds with the challenge of anger, or the call of
allurement. This delightful concert of the grove, which is &s;o much admired by
man, is no way &s;tudied for his amu&s;ement: it is u&s;ually the call of the
male to the female; his efforts to &s;ooth her during the times of incu|bation:
or it is a challenge between two males, for the affections of &s;ome common
favourite.</P>
<P>It is by this call that birds begin to pair at the approach of
&s;pring, and provide for the &s;upport of a future progeny. The loude&s;t
notes are u&s;ually from the male; while the hen &s;eldom expre&s;&s;es her
con&s;ent, but in a &s;hort, interrupted <PB N="23" REF="26"> twittering. This
compact, at lea&s;t for the &s;ea&s;on, holds with unbroken faith: many birds
live with inviolable fidelity together for a con|&s;tancy; and when one dies,
the other is always &s;een to &s;hare the &s;ame fate &s;oon after. We mu&s;t
not take our idea of the conjugal fidelity of birds from ob&s;erving the
poultry in our yards, who&s;e freedom is abridged, and who&s;e manners are
totally corrupted by &s;lavery. We mu&s;t look for it in our fields and our
fore&s;ts, where nature continues in unadulterated &s;implicity; where the
number of males is generally equal to that of females; and where every little
animal &s;eems prouder of his progeny than plea&s;ed with his mate. Were it
po&s;&s;ible to compare &s;en&s;ations, the male of all wild birds &s;eems as
happy in the young brood as the female; and all his former care&s;&s;es, all
his &s;oothing melodies, &s;eem only aimed at that important occa&s;ion when
they are both to become parents, and to educate a pro|geny of their own
producing. The plea&s;ures of love appear dull in their effects, when com|pared
to the interval immediately after the ex|clu&s;ion of their young. They both
&s;eem, at that &s;ea&s;on, tran&s;ported with plea&s;ure; every action
te&s;tifies their pride, their importance, and tender &s;olicitude.</P>
<P>When the bu&s;ine&s;s of fecundation is per|formed, 
<PB N="24" REF="27"> the female then begins to lay. Such eggs as have been
impregnated by the cock are prolific; and &s;uch as have not (for &s;he lays
often without any congre&s;s what&s;oever) continue bar|ren, and are only
addled by incubation. Pre|vious, however, to laying, the work of ne&s;tling
becomes the common care; and this is per|formed with no &s;mall degree of
a&s;&s;iduity and apparent de&s;ign. It has been a&s;&s;erted, that birds of
one kind always make their ne&s;ts in the &s;ame manner, and of the &s;ame
materials; but the truth is, that they vary this as the materials, places, or
climates happen to differ. The red-brea&s;t, in &s;ome parts of England, makes
its ne&s;t with oak leaves, where they are in greate&s;t plenty; in other parts
with mo&s;s and hair. Some birds, that with us make a very warm ne&s;t, are
le&s;s &s;olicitous in the tropical climates, where the heat of the weather
promotes the bu&s;ine&s;s of incubation. In general, however, every &s;pecies
of birds has a peculiar archi|tecture of its own; and this adapted to the
number of eggs, the temperature of the cli|mate, or the re&s;pective heat of
the little animal's own body. Where the eggs are numerous, it is then incumbent
to make the ne&s;t warm, that the animal heat may be equally diffu&s;ed to them
all. Thus the wren, and all the &s;mall birds, <PB N="25" REF="28"> make the
ne&s;t very warm; for having many eggs, it is requi&s;ite to di&s;tribute
warmth to them in common: on the contrary, the plover, that has but two eggs,
the eagle, and the crow, are not &s;o &s;olicitous in this re&s;pect, as their
bodies are capable of being applied to the &s;mall number upon which they
&s;it. With regard to climate, water-fowl, that with us make but a very
&s;lovenly ne&s;t, are much more exact in this particular, in the colder
regions of the north. They there take every precaution to make it warm; and
&s;ome kinds &s;trip the down from their brea&s;ts, to line it with greater
&s;ecurity.</P>
<P>In general, however, every bird re&s;orts to hatch in tho&s;e
climates and places where its food is found in greate&s;t plenty; and always at
that &s;ea&s;on when provi&s;ions are in the greate&s;t abundance. The large
birds, and tho&s;e of the aquatic kinds, chu&s;e places as remote from man as
po&s;&s;ible, as their food is in general different from that which is
cultivated by human labour. Some birds, which have only the &s;erpent to fear,
build their ne&s;ts depending from the end of a &s;mall bough, and form the
entrance from below; being thus &s;ecured either from the &s;er|pent or the
monkey tribes. But all the little birds which live upon fruits and corn, and
that are too often unwelcome intruders upon the <PB N="26" REF="29"> fruits of
human indu&s;try, in making their ne&s;ts, u&s;e every precaution to conceal
them from man. On the other hand, the great birds, remote from human &s;ociety,
u&s;e every precaution to render theirs inacce&s;&s;ible to wild bea&s;ts or
vermin.</P>
<P>Nothing can exceed the patience of birds while hatching; neither
the calls of hunger, nor the near approach of danger, can drive them from the
ne&s;t. They are often fat upon be|ginning to &s;it, yet before incubation is
over, the female is u&s;ually wa&s;ted to &s;kin and bone. Ravens and crows,
while the females are &s;itting, take care to provide them with food; and this
in great abundance. But it is different with mo&s;t of the &s;maller kinds:
during the whole time the male &s;its near his mate upon &s;ome tree, and
&s;ooths her by his &s;inging; and often when &s;he is tired takes her place,
and patiently continues upon the ne&s;t till &s;he returns. Sometimes, however,
the eggs acquire a degree of heat too much for the purpo&s;es of hatching: in
&s;uch ca&s;es, the hen leaves them to cool a little; and then returns to
&s;it, with her u&s;ual per&s;everance and plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>So great is the power of in&s;tinct, in animals of this cla&s;s,
that they &s;eem driven from one ap|petite to another, and continue almo&s;t
pa&s;&s;ive under its influence. Rea&s;on we cannot call it, 
<PB N="27" REF="30"> &s;ince the fir&s;t dictates of that principle would be
&s;elf-pre&s;ervation: 
<Q REND="inline">"Take a brute," &s;ays Ad|di&s;on, "out of his
in&s;tinct, and you find him wholly deprived of under&s;tanding. With what
caution," continues he, "does the hen provide her&s;elf a ne&s;t in places
unfrequented, and free from noi&s;e and di&s;turbance! When &s;he has laid her
eggs in &s;uch a manner that &s;he can cover them, what care does &s;he take in
turning them frequently, that all parts may partake of the vital warmth! When
&s;he leaves them to provide for her nece&s;&s;ary &s;u&s;tenance, how
punctually does &s;he return before they have time to cool, and become
incapable of producing an animal! In the &s;ummer you &s;ee her giving
her&s;elf greater freedoms, and quit|ting her care for above two hours
together: but in winter, when the rigour of the &s;ea&s;on would chill the
principles of life, and de&s;troy the young one, &s;he grows more a&s;&s;iduous
in her attendance, and &s;tays away but half the time. When the birth
approaches, with how much nicety and attention does &s;he help the chick to
break the pri&s;on! not to take notice of her covering it from the injuries of
the weather, providing it with proper nouri&s;h|ment, and teaching it to help
it&s;elf; nor to mention her for&s;aking the ne&s;t, if, after the 
<PB N="28" REF="31"> u&s;ual time of reckoning, the young one does not make its
appearance. A chymical opera|tion could not be followed with greater art or
diligence than is &s;een in the hatching a chick, though there are many birds
that &s;hew an in|finitely greater &s;agacity: yet at the &s;ame time the hen,
that has all this &s;eeming ingenuity, (which is indeed ab&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary for the propagation of the &s;pecies) con&s;idered in other
re&s;pects, is without the lea&s;t glimmerings of thought or common &s;en&s;e:
&s;he mi&s;takes a piece of chalk for an egg, and &s;its upon it in the &s;ame
manner; &s;he is in&s;en&s;ible of any encrea&s;e or diminution in the number
of tho&s;e &s;he lays; &s;he does not di&s;tingui&s;h between her own, and
tho&s;e of another &s;pecies; and when the birth appears of never &s;o
different a bird, will cheri&s;h it for her own. An hen followed by a brood of
ducks, &s;hall &s;tand affrighted at the edge of the pond, trembling for the
fate of her young, which &s;he &s;ees venturing into &s;o dan|gerous an
element. As the different principle which acts in the&s;e different animals
cannot be termed rea&s;on, &s;o when we call it in&s;tinct, we mean &s;omething
we have no knowledge of. It appears to me the immediate direction of
Pro|vidence; and &s;uch an operation of the Supreme Being as that which
determines all the por|tions of matter to their proper centers."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="32">The production of the young, as was &s;aid,
&s;eems to be the great aera of a bird's happine&s;s. Nothing can at that time
exceed its &s;pirit and indu&s;try: the mo&s;t timid becomes courageous in the
defence of its young. Birds of the rapa|cious kind, at this &s;ea&s;on, become
more than u&s;ually fierce and active. They carry their prey, yet throbbing
with life, to the ne&s;t, and early accu&s;tom their young to habits of
&s;laughter and cruelty. Nor are tho&s;e of milder natures le&s;s bu&s;ily
employed; the little birds then di&s;con|tinue their &s;inging, taken up with
more import|ant pur&s;uits of common &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>While the young are yet unfledged, and continue in the ne&s;t,
the old ones take care to provide them with a regular &s;upply; and, le&s;t one
&s;hould take all nouri&s;hment from the re&s;t, they feed each of the young in
their turn. If they perceive that man has been bu&s;y with their ne&s;t, or has
handled the little ones, they abandon the place by night, and provide their
brood a more &s;ecure, though le&s;s commodious retreat. When the whole family
is fully plumed, and capable of avoiding danger by flight, they are then led
forth when the weather is fine, and taught the paternal art of providing for
their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. They are led to the places where their food lies; they
are &s;hewn the method of <PB N="30" REF="33"> di&s;covering or carrying it
away; and then led back to the ne&s;t, for a day or two longer. At length, when
they are completely qualified to &s;hift for them&s;elves, the old ones take
them abroad, and leading them to the accu&s;tomed places, for&s;ake them for
the la&s;t time; and all future connexion is ever at an end.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e birds which are hatched and &s;ent out earlie&s;t in the
&s;ea&s;on are the mo&s;t &s;trong and vigorous; tho&s;e, on the other hand,
that have been delayed till the mid&s;t of &s;ummer, are more feeble and
tender, and &s;ometimes incapable of &s;u&s;taining the rigours of the
en&s;uing winter. Birds them&s;elves &s;eem &s;en&s;ible of this difference,
and endeavour to produce early in the &s;pring. If, however, their efforts are
ob&s;tructed by having their ne&s;ts robbed, or &s;ome &s;imilar ac|cident,
they &s;till per&s;evere in their efforts for a progeny; and it often happens
that &s;ome are thus retarded till the mid&s;t of winter. What number of eggs
any bird can lay in the cour&s;e of a &s;ea&s;on is not a&s;certained; but this
is true, that &s;uch as would have laid but two or three at the mo&s;t, if
their ne&s;ts be robbed, or their eggs &s;tolen, will lay above ten or twelve.
A common hen, if moderately fed, will lay above an hundred from the beginning
of &s;pring to the latter end of autumn. In general, however, it 
<PB N="31" REF="34"> obtains, that the &s;malle&s;t and weake&s;t animals are
the mo&s;t prolific, while the &s;trong and ra|pacious are abridged by
&s;terility. Thus, &s;uch kinds as are ea&s;ily de&s;troyed, are as readily
re|paired; and Nature, where &s;he has denied the power of re&s;i&s;tance, has
compen&s;ated by the fer|tility attending procreation.</P>
<P>Birds in general, though they have &s;o much to fear from man
and each other, are &s;eldom &s;cared away from their u&s;ual haunts. Although
they be &s;o perfectly formed for a wandering life, and are &s;upplied with
powers to &s;atisfy all their appetites, though never &s;o remote from the
ob|ject, though they are &s;o well fitted for changing place with ea&s;e and
rapidity, yet the greate&s;t number remain contented in the di&s;tricts where
they have been bred, and by no means exert their de&s;ires in proportion to
their endowments. The rook, if undi&s;turbed, never de&s;ires to leave his
native grove; the black-bird &s;till frequents its accu&s;tomed hedge; and the
red-brea&s;t, though &s;eemingly mild, claims a certain di&s;trict, from whence
he &s;eldom moves, but drives out every one of the &s;ame &s;pecies from thence
with|out pity. They are excited to migration by no other motives but tho&s;e of
fear, climate, or hunger. It mu&s;t be from one of the&s;e powerful motives
that the birds, which are called birds of <PB N="32" REF="35"> pa&s;&s;age,
every year for&s;ake us for &s;ome time, and make their regular and expected
returns.</P>
<P>Nothing has more employed the curio&s;ity of mankind than
the&s;e annual emigrations; and yet few &s;ubjects continue &s;o much involved
in darkne&s;s. It is generally believed, that the cau&s;e of their retreat from
the&s;e parts of Europe is either a &s;carcity of food at certain &s;ea&s;ons,
or the want of a &s;ecure a&s;ylum from the per&s;e|cution of man during the
time of court&s;hip and bringing up their young. Thus the &s;tarling, in
Sweden, at the approach of winter, finding &s;ub&s;i&s;tence no longer in that
kingdom, de&s;cends every year into Germany; and the hen chaf|finches of the
&s;ame country are &s;een every year to fly through Holland in large flocks, to
pa&s;s their winter in a milder climate. Others, with a more daring &s;pirit,
prepare for journies that might intimidate even human per&s;everance. Thus the
quails in &s;pring for&s;ake the burning heats of Africa for the milder &s;un
of Europe; and, when they have pa&s;&s;ed the &s;ummer with us, &s;teer their
&s;light back to enjoy in Egypt the temperate air, which then begins to be
delightful. This with them &s;eems a preconcerted under|taking. They unite
together in &s;ome open place, for &s;ome days before their departure, and, by
an odd kind of chattering, &s;eem to de|bate <PB N="33" REF="36"> on the method
to proceed. When their plan is re&s;olved upon, they all take flight to|gether,
and often appear in &s;uch numbers, that, to mariners at &s;ea, they &s;eem
like a cloud that re&s;ts upon the horizon. The bolde&s;t, &s;tronge&s;t, and
by far the greate&s;t number, make good their intention; but many there are
who, not well apprized of their own force for the un|dertaking, grow weary in
the way and, quite &s;pent by the fatigues of their flight, drop down into the
&s;ea, and &s;ometimes upon deck, thus becoming an ea&s;y prey to the
mariner.</P>
<P>Of the va&s;t quantity of water-fowl that fre|quent our
&s;hores, it is amazing to reflect how few are known to breed here. The cau&s;e
that principally urges them to leave this country &s;eems to be not merely the
want of food, but the de&s;ire of a &s;ecure retreat. Our country is too
populous for birds &s;o &s;hy and timid as the greate&s;t number of the&s;e
are. When great part of our i&s;land was a mere wa&s;te, an uncultivated tract
of woods and mar&s;hes, many &s;pecies of birds which now migrate remained with
us throughout the year. The great heron and the crane, that have now for&s;aken
this country, in former times bred familiarly in our mar&s;hes, and &s;eemed to
animate our fens. Their ne&s;ts, like tho&s;e of mo&s;t cloven-footed
water-fowl, were <PB N="34" REF="37"> built on the ground, and expo&s;ed to
every in|vader. But as rural oeconomy encrea&s;ed, the&s;e animals were more
and more di&s;turbed. Before they had little to fear, as the &s;urrounding
mar&s;h defended them from all the carnivorous quadru|pedes, and their own
&s;trength from birds of prey; but upon the intru&s;ion of man, and by a long
&s;eries of alarms, they have at length been obliged to &s;eek, during the
&s;ummer, &s;ome lonely habi|tation, at a &s;afe di&s;tance from every
de&s;troyer.</P>
<P>Of the numerous tribes of the duck kind, we know of no more than
five that breed here; the tame &s;wan, the tame goo&s;e, the &s;heldrake, the
eider duck, and a few of the wild ducks. The re&s;t contribute to form that
amazing mul|titude of water-fowl which annually repair to the dreary lakes and
de&s;arts of Lapland from the more &s;outhern countries of Europe. In tho&s;e
exten&s;ive and &s;olitary retreats, they perform the duties of incubation and
nutrition in full &s;ecu|rity. There are few of this kind that may not be
traced to the northern de&s;erts, to countries of lakes, rivers, &s;wamps, and
mountains, covered with thick and gloomy fore&s;ts, that afford &s;helter
during &s;ummer to the timid animals, who live there in undi&s;turbed
&s;ecurity. In tho&s;e regions, from the thickne&s;s of the fore&s;ts, the
ground remains moi&s;t and penetrable during the &s;um|mer <PB N="35" REF="38">
&s;ea&s;on; the woodcock, the &s;nipe, and other &s;lender billed birds, can
there feed at ea&s;e; while the web-footed birds find more than &s;ufficient
plenty of food from the number of in&s;ects, which &s;warm there to an
incredible degree. The days there are long; and the beautiful meteorous nights
afford them every opportunity of col|lecting &s;o minute a food, which is
probably of all others the mo&s;t grateful. We are not to be a&s;toni&s;hed,
therefore, at the amazing numbers of fowl that de&s;cend from the&s;e regions
at the approach of winter; numbers to which the army of Xerxes was but trifling
in compari&s;on; and which Linnaeus has ob&s;erved for eight whole days and
nights to cover the &s;urface of the river Calix.</P>
<P>This migration from the north u&s;ually begins in September,
when they quit their retreats, and di&s;per&s;e them&s;elves over all the
&s;outhern parts of Europe. It is not unplea&s;ing to ob&s;erve the order of
their flight; they generally range them&s;elves in a long line, or they
&s;ometimes make their march angularly, two lines uniting in the center like
the letter V rever&s;ed. The bird which leads at the point &s;eems to cleave
the air, to facilitate the pa&s;&s;age for tho&s;e which are to fol|low. When
fatigued with this laborious &s;tation, it falls back into one of the wings of
the file, <PB N="36" REF="39"> while another takes its place. With us they make
their appearance about the beginning of Oc|tober, circulate fir&s;t round our
&s;hores, and, when compelled by &s;evere fro&s;t, betake them&s;elves to our
lakes and rivers. Some, indeed, of the web-footed fowl, of hardier
con&s;titutions than the re&s;t, abide the rigours of their northern climate
the whole winter; but when the cold reigns there with more than u&s;ual
&s;everity, they are obliged to &s;eek for more &s;outhern &s;kies. They then
repair with the re&s;t for &s;helter to the&s;e king|doms; &s;o that the diver,
the wild &s;wan, and the &s;wallow-tailed &s;heldrake, vi&s;it our coa&s;ts but
&s;el|dom, and that only when compelled by the &s;e|verity of their winters at
home.</P>
<P>It has been often a &s;ubject of a&s;toni&s;hment, how animals
to all appearance &s;o dull and irra|tional &s;hould perform &s;uch long
journeys, &s;hould know whither to &s;teer, and when to &s;et out upon &s;uch a
great undertaking. It is probable that the &s;ame in&s;tinct which governs all
their other actions operates al&s;o here. They rather follow the weather than
the country; they &s;teer only from colder or warmer climates into tho&s;e of
an oppo&s;ite nature; and, finding the variations of the air as they proceed in
their favour, go on till they find land to repo&s;e on. It cannot be
&s;up|po&s;ed that they have any memory of the country <PB N="37" REF="40">
where they might have &s;pent a former winter; it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that
they &s;ee the country to which they travel from their height in the air;
&s;ince, though they mounted for miles, the con|vexity of the globe would
intercept their view; it mu&s;t therefore only be, that they go on as they
continue to perceive the atmo&s;phere more &s;uitable to their pre&s;ent wants
and di&s;po&s;itions.</P>
<P>All this &s;eems to be pretty plain; but there is a
circum&s;tance attending the migration of &s;wal|lows which wraps this
&s;ubject in great ob&s;curity. It is agreed on all hands, that they are &s;een
mi|grating into warmer climates, and that in amazing numbers, at the approach
of the European win|ter. Their return into Europe is al&s;o as well at|te&s;ted
about the beginning of &s;ummer; but we have another account, which &s;erves to
prove that numbers of them continue torpid here during the winter; and, like
bats, make their retreat into old walls, the hollow of trees, or even &s;ink
into the deepe&s;t lakes, and find &s;ecurity for the winter &s;ea&s;on, by
remaining there in clu&s;ters at the bottom. However this latter circum&s;tance
may be, their retreat into old walls is too well authenticated to remain a
doubt at pre&s;ent. The difficulty, therefore, is to account for this
dif|ference in the&s;e animals thus variou&s;ly preparing to encounter the
winter. It was &s;uppo&s;ed that <PB N="38" REF="41"> in &s;ome of them the
blood might lo&s;e its motion by the cold, and that thus they were rendered
torpid by the &s;everity of the &s;ea&s;on; but Mr. Buffon having placed many
of this tribe in an ice-hou&s;e, found that the &s;ame cold by which their
blood was congealed was fatal to the ani|mal; it remains, therefore, a doubt to
this hour whether there may not be a &s;pecies of &s;wallows, to all external
appearance like the re&s;t, but differently formed within, &s;o as to fit them
for a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility during the winter here. It was
&s;ugge&s;ted, indeed, that the &s;wallows found thus torpid were &s;uch only
as were too weak to undertake the migration, or were hatched too late to join
the general convoy; but it was upon the&s;e that Mr. Buffon tried his
experiment; it was the&s;e that died under the operation.</P>
<P>Thus there are &s;ome birds which by migrating make an
habitation of every part of the earth; but in general every climate has birds
peculiar to it&s;elf. The feathered inhabitants of the temperate zone are but
little remarkable for the beauty of their plumage; but then the &s;maller kinds
make up for this defect by the melody of their voices. The birds of the torrid
zone are very bright and vivid in their colours; but they have &s;creaming
voices, or are totally &s;ilent. The frigid zone, on the other hand, where the 
<PB N="39" REF="42"> &s;eas abound with fi&s;h, are &s;tocked with birds of the
aquatic kind, in much greater plenty than in Europe; and the&s;e are generally
cloathed with a warmer coat of feathers; or they have large quantities of fat
lying underneath the &s;kin, which &s;erves to defend them from the rigours of
the climate.</P>
<P>In all countries, however, birds are a more long-lived cla&s;s
of animals than the quadrupedes or in&s;ects of the &s;ame climate. The life of
man him&s;elf is but &s;hort, when compared to what &s;ome of them enjoy. It is
&s;aid that &s;wans have been known to live three hundred years: gee&s;e are
often &s;een to live four&s;core; while linnets, and other little birds, though
impri&s;oned in cages, are often found to reach fourteen or fifteen. How birds,
who&s;e age of perfection is much more early than that of quadrupedes, &s;hould
yet live comparatively &s;o much longer, is not ea&s;ily to be accounted for:
perhaps, as their bones are lighter, and more porous than tho&s;e of
quadrupedes, there are fewer ob&s;tructions in the animal machine; and Nature,
thus finding more room for the operations of life, it is car|ried on to a
greater extent.</P>
<P>All birds in general are le&s;s than quadru|pedes; that is, the
greate&s;t of one cla&s;s far &s;urpa&s;s the greate&s;t of the other in
magnitude <PB N="40" REF="43"> The o&s;trich, which is the greate&s;t of birds,
bears no proportion to the elephant; and the &s;malle&s;t humming-bird, which
is the lea&s;t of the cla&s;s, is &s;till far more minute than the mou&s;e. In
the&s;e the extremities of Nature are plainly di|&s;cernible; and in forming
them &s;he appears to have been doubtful in her operations: the o&s;trich,
&s;eemingly covered with hair, and in|capable of flight, making near approaches
to the quadrupede cla&s;s; while the humming-bird, of the &s;ize of an
humble-bee, and with a flut|tering motion, &s;eems nearly allied to the
in&s;ect.</P>
<P>The&s;e extremities of this cla&s;s are rather ob|jects of human
curio&s;ity than utility: it is the middle order of birds which man has taken
care to propagate and maintain. Of tho&s;e which he has taken under his
protection, and which admini&s;ter to his plea&s;ures or nece&s;&s;ities, the
greate&s;t number &s;eem creatures of his for|mation. The variety of climate to
which he con&s;igns them, the food with which he &s;upplies them, and the
purpo&s;es for which he employs them, produce amazing varieties, both in their
colours, &s;hape, magnitude, and the ta&s;te of their fle&s;h. Wild birds are,
for the mo&s;t part, of the &s;ame magnitude and &s;hape; they &s;till keep the
prints of primaeval nature &s;trong upon them: except in a few they generally
maintain <PB N="41" REF="44"> their very colour: but it is otherwi&s;e with
do|me&s;tic animals; they change at the will of man&mdash;of the tame pigeon,
for in&s;tance, it is &s;aid that they can be bred to a feather.</P>
<P>As we are thus capable of influencing their form and colour,
&s;o al&s;o is it frequent to &s;ee equal in&s;tances of our influencing their
habitudes, appetites and pa&s;&s;ions. The cock, for in&s;tance, is
artificially formed into that courage and acti|vity which he is &s;een to
po&s;&s;e&s;s; and many birds te&s;tify a &s;trong attachment to the hand that
feeds them: how far they are capable of in&s;truction, is manife&s;t to tho&s;e
who have the care of hawks. But a &s;till more &s;urprizing in&s;tance of this,
was &s;een &s;ome time ago in London: a canary bird was taught to pick up the
letters of the alphabet, at the word of command, &s;o as to &s;pell any
per&s;on's name in company; and this the little animal did by motions from its
ma&s;ter, which were imperceptible to every other &s;pectator. Upon the whole,
however, they are inferior to quadrupedes in docility; and &s;eem more
me|chanically impelled by all the power of in&s;tinct.</P>

<PB N="42" REF="45">
<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of the Divi&s;ion of Birds.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH birds are fitted for &s;porting in air, yet as they find
their food upon the &s;urface of the earth, there &s;eems a variety equal to
the different aliments with which it tends to &s;upply them. The flat and
burning de&s;art, the rocky cliff, the exten&s;ive fen, the &s;tormy ocean, as
well as the plea&s;ing land&s;cape, have all their peculiar inhabitants. The
mo&s;t obvious di|&s;tinction therefore of birds, is into tho&s;e that live by
land, and tho&s;e that live by water; or, in other words, into <HI>land
birds,</HI> and <HI>water fowl.</HI></P>
<P>It is no difficult matter to di&s;tingui&s;h land from water
fowl, by the legs and toes. All land birds have their toes divided, without any
mem|brane or web between them; and their legs and feet &s;erve them for the
purpo&s;es of running, gra&s;ping, or climbing. On the other hand, water fowl
have their legs and feet formed for the purpo&s;es of wading in water, or
&s;wimming on its &s;urface. In tho&s;e that wade, the legs are u&s;ually long
and naked; in tho&s;e that &s;wim, the toes are webbed together, as we &s;ee in
the feet of a goo&s;e, which &s;erve, like oars, to drive <PB N="43" REF="46">
them forward with greater velocity. The for|mation, therefore, of land and
water fowl, is as di&s;tinct as their habits; and Nature her&s;elf &s;eems to
offer us this obvious di&s;tribution, in methodizing animals of the feathered
creation.</P>
<P>However, a di&s;tinction &s;o comprehen&s;ive goes but a &s;hort
way in illu&s;trating the different tribes of &s;o numerous a cla&s;s. The
number of birds already known, amounts to above eight hundred; and every
per&s;on who turns his mind to the&s;e kinds of pur&s;uits, is every day adding
to the catalogue. It is not enough, therefore, to be able to di&s;tingui&s;h a
land from a water fowl; much more is &s;till required: to be able to
di|&s;tingui&s;h the different kinds of birds from each other; and even the
varieties in the &s;ame kind, when they happen to offer. This certainly is a
work of great difficulty; and perhaps the at|tainment will not repay the
labour. The &s;en|&s;ible part of mankind will not withdraw all their attention
from more important pur&s;uits, to give it entirely up to what promi&s;es to
repay them only with a very confined &s;pecies of amu&s;ement. In my
di&s;tribution of birds, therefore, I will follow Linnaeus in the fir&s;t
&s;ketch of his &s;y&s;tem; and then leave him, to follow the mo&s;t natural
di&s;tinctions, in enumerating the different kinds that admit of an hi&s;tory,
or require a de&s;cription<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"></P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="47">Linnaeus divides all birds into &s;ix
cla&s;&s;es: namely, into birds of the <HI>rapacious kind,</HI> birds of the
<HI>pie kind,</HI> birds of the <HI>poultry kind,</HI> birds of the
<HI>&s;parrow kind,</HI> birds of the <HI>duck kind,</HI> and birds of the
<HI>crane kind.</HI> The four fir&s;t com|prehend the various kinds of land
birds; the two la&s;t, tho&s;e that belong to the water.</P>
<P>Birds of the <HI>rapacious kind</HI> con&s;titute that cla&s;s
of carnivorous fowl that live by rapine. He di&s;tingui&s;hes them by their
beak, which is hooked, &s;trong, and notched at the point; by their legs, which
are &s;hort and mu&s;cular, and made for the purpo&s;es of tearing; by their
toes, which are &s;trong and knobbed; and their talons, which are &s;harp and
crooked; by the make of their body, which is mu&s;cular; and their fle&s;h,
which is impure: nor are they le&s;s known by their food, which con&s;i&s;ts
entirely of fle&s;h; their &s;tomach, which is membranous; and their manners,
which are fierce and cruel.</P>
<P>Birds of the <HI>pie kind</HI> have the bill differing from the
former: as in tho&s;e it re&s;embled an hook, de&s;tined for tearing to pieces;
in the&s;e it re&s;embles a wedge, fitted for the purpo&s;e of cleaving. Their
legs are formed &s;hort and &s;trong for walking; their body is &s;lender and
impure, and their food mi&s;cellaneous. They ne&s;tle in trees; and the male
feeds the female during the time of incubation.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="48">Birds of the <HI>poultry kind</HI> have the
bill a little convex, for the purpo&s;es of gathering their food. The upper
chap hangs over the lower; their bodies are fat and mu&s;cular, and their
fle&s;h white and pure. They live upon grain, which is moi&s;tened in the crop.
They make their ne&s;t on the ground, without art; they lay many eggs, and
u&s;e promi&s;cuous venery.</P>
<P>Birds of the <HI>&s;parrow kind</HI> comprehend all that
beautiful and vocal cla&s;s that adorn our fields and groves, and gratify every
&s;en&s;e in its turn. Their bills may be compared to a forceps that catches
hold: their legs are formed for hopping along; their bodies are tender; pure in
&s;uch as feed upon grain, impure in &s;uch as live upon in&s;ects. They live
chiefly in trees; their ne&s;ts are artificially made, and their amours are
ob&s;erved with connubial fidelity.</P>
<P>Birds of the <HI>duck kind</HI> u&s;e their bill as a kind of
&s;trainer to their food; it is &s;mooth, covered with a &s;kin, and nervous at
the point. Their legs are &s;hort, and their feet formed for &s;wim|ming, the
toes being webbed together. Their body is fat, inclining to rancidity. They
live in waters, and chiefly build their ne&s;ts upon land.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the order of birds that belong to the waters,
tho&s;e of the <HI>crane kind</HI> have the <PB N="46" REF="49"> bill formed
for the purpo&s;es of &s;earching and examining the bottom of pools: their legs
are long, and formed for wading; their toes are not webbed; their thighs are
half naked; their body is &s;lender, and covered with a very thin &s;kin; their
tail is &s;hort, and their fle&s;h &s;avoury. They live in lakes upon animals,
and they chiefly build their ne&s;ts upon the ground.</P>
<P>Such is the divi&s;ion of Linnaeus, with re&s;pect to this
cla&s;s of animals; and at fir&s;t &s;ight it appears natural and
comprehen&s;ive. But we mu&s;t not be deceived by appearances: the &s;tudent,
who &s;hould imagine he was making a progre&s;s in the hi&s;tory of nature,
while he was only thus making arbitrary di&s;tributions, would be very much
mi&s;taken. Should he come to enter deeper into this naturali&s;t's plan, he
would find birds the mo&s;t unlike in nature thrown together into the &s;ame
cla&s;s; and find animals joined, that entirely differ in climate, in
ha|bitudes, in manners, in &s;hape, colouring and &s;ize. In &s;uch a
di&s;tribution, for in&s;tance, he would find the humming-bird and the raven,
the rail and the o&s;trich, joined in the &s;ame family. If when he a&s;ked
what &s;ort of a creature was the humming-bird, he were told that it was in the
&s;ame cla&s;s with the carrion crow, would he not think him&s;elf impo&s;ed 
<PB N="47" REF="50"> upon? In &s;uch a ca&s;e, the only way to form any idea of
the animal who&s;e hi&s;tory he de&s;ires to know, is to &s;ee it; and that
curio&s;ity very few have an opportunity of gratifying. The number of birds is
&s;o great, that it might exhau&s;t the patience not only of the writer, but
the reader, to examine them all: in the pre&s;ent confined undertaking it would
certainly be impo&s;&s;ible. I will therefore now attach my&s;elf to a more
natural method: and, &s;till keeping the general divi&s;ion of Linnaeus before
me, enter into &s;ome de&s;cription of the mo&s;t noted, or the mo&s;t worth
knowing.</P>
<P>Under one or other cla&s;s, as I &s;hall treat them, the reader
will probably find all the &s;pecies, and all the varieties that demand his
curio&s;ity. When the leader of any tribe is de&s;cribed, and its hi&s;tory
known, it will give a very tolerable idea of all the &s;pecies contained under
it. It is true, the reader will not thus have his knowledge ranged under &s;uch
preci&s;e di&s;tinctions; nor can he be able to &s;ay, with &s;uch fluency,
that the rail is of the o&s;trich cla&s;s: but what is much more material, he
will have a tolerable hi&s;tory of the bird he de&s;ires to know, or at lea&s;t
of that which mo&s;t re&s;embles it in nature.</P>
<P>However, it may be proper to apprize the <PB N="48" REF="51">
reader that he will not here find his curio&s;ity &s;atisfied, as in &s;ome of
the former volumes, where we often took Mr. Buffon for our guide. Tho&s;e who
have hitherto written the natural hi&s;tory of birds, have in general been
contented with telling their names, or de&s;cribing their toes or their
plumage. It mu&s;t often therefore happen, that in&s;tead of giving the
hi&s;tory of a bird, we mu&s;t be content to importune the reader with merely
its de&s;cription. I will there|fore divide the following hi&s;tory of birds,
with Linnaeus, into &s;ix parts: in the fir&s;t of which I will give &s;uch as
Bri&s;&s;on has ranged among the rapacious birds; next tho&s;e of the pie kind;
and thus go on through the &s;ucceeding cla&s;&s;es, till I fini&s;h with
tho&s;e of the duck kind. But before I enter upon a &s;y&s;tematic detail, I
will beg leave to give the hi&s;tory of three or four birds, that do not well
range in any &s;y&s;tem. The&s;e, from their great &s;ize, are &s;ufficiently
di&s;tingui&s;hable from the re&s;t; and from their incapacity of flying, lead
a life a good deal differing from the re&s;t of the feathered creation. The
birds I mean are the O&s;trich, the Ca&s;&s;owary, the Emu, the Dodo, and the
Solitaire.</P>

<P> <PB N="49" REF="53">IN beginning with the feathered tribe, the
fir&s;t animal that offers &s;eems to unite the cla&s;s of quadrupedes and of
birds in it&s;elf. While it has the general outline and properties of a bird,
yet it retains many of the marks of the quadrupede. In appearance the o&s;trich
re&s;embles the camel, and is almo&s;t as tall; it is covered with a plumage
that re&s;embles hair much more nearly than feathers, and its internal parts
bear as near a &s;imilitude to tho&s;e of the quadrupede as of the bird
creation. It may be con&s;idered, therefore, as an animal made to fill up that
cha&s;m in nature which &s;eparates one cla&s;s of beings from another.</P>
<P>The o&s;trich is the large&s;t of all birds. Tra|vellers affirm
that they are &s;een as tall as a man on hor&s;eback; and even &s;ome of
tho&s;e that have been brought into England were above &s;even feet high. The
head and bill &s;omewhat re&s;emble tho&s;e of a duck; and the neck may be
likened to that of a &s;wan, but that it is much longer; the legs and thighs
re&s;emble tho&s;e of an hen; though the whole appearance bears a &s;trong
re|&s;emblance to that of a camel. But to be more <PB REF="54">

particular; it is u&s;ually &s;even feet high from the top of the head to the
ground; but from the back it is only four; &s;o that the head and neck are
above three feet long. From the top of the head to the rump, when the neck is
&s;tretched out in a right line, it is &s;ix feet long, and the tail is about a
foot more. One of the wings, without the feathers, is a foot and an half; and
being &s;tretched out, with the feathers, is three feet.</P>
<P>The plumage is much alike in all; that is, generally black and
white; though &s;ome of them are &s;aid to be grey. The greate&s;t feathers are
at the extremities of the wings and tail, and the large&s;t are generally
white. The next row is black and white; and of the &s;mall feathers, on the
back and belly, &s;ome are white and others black. There are no feathers on the
&s;ides, nor yet on the thighs, nor under the wings. The lower part of the
neck, about half way, is covered with &s;till &s;maller feathers than tho&s;e
on the belly and back; and tho&s;e, like the former, al&s;o are of different
colours.</P>
<P>All the&s;e feathers are of the &s;ame kind, and peculiar to the
o&s;trich; for other birds have &s;everal &s;orts, &s;ome of which are-&s;oft
and downy, and others hard and &s;trong. O&s;trich feathers are almo&s;t all as
&s;oft as down, being utterly <PB N="51" REF="57"> unfit to &s;erve the animal
for flying, and &s;till le&s;s adapted to be a proper defence again&s;t
external in|jury. The feathers of other birds have the webs broader on one
&s;ide than the other, but tho&s;e of the o&s;trich have their &s;haft exactly
in the middle. The upper part of the head and neck are covered with a very fine
clear white hair, that &s;hines like the bri&s;tles of a hog; and in &s;ome
places there are &s;mall tufts of it, con&s;i&s;ting of about twelve hairs,
which grow from a &s;ingle &s;haft about the thickne&s;s of a pin.</P>
<P>At the end of each wing, there is a kind of &s;pur almo&s;t like
the quill of a porcupine. It is an inch long, being hollow and of an horny
&s;ub&s;tance. There are two of the&s;e on each wing; the large&s;t of which is
at the extremity of the bone of the wing, and the other a foot lower. The neck
&s;eems to be more &s;lender in propor|tion to that of other birds, from its
not being furni&s;hed with feathers. The &s;kin in this part is of a livid
fle&s;h colour, which &s;ome improperly would have to be blue. The bill is
&s;hort and pointed, and two inches and an half at the be|ginning. The external
form of the eye is like that of a man, the upper eye-lid being adorned with
eye-la&s;hes which are longer than tho&s;e on the lid below. The tongue is
&s;mall, very &s;hort, <PB N="52" REF="58"> and compo&s;ed of cartilages,
ligaments, and membranes, intermixed with fle&s;hy fibres. In &s;ome it is
about an inch long, and very thick at the bottom. In others it is but half an
inch, being a little forked at the end.</P>
<P>The thighs are very fle&s;hy and large, being covered with a
white &s;kin, inclining to redne&s;s, and wrinkled in the manner of a net,
who&s;e me&s;hes will admit the end of a finger. Some have very &s;mall
feathers here and there on the thighs; and others again have neither feathers
nor wrinkles. What are called the legs of birds in this are covered before with
large &s;cales. The end of the foot is cloven, and has two very large toes,
which, like the leg, are covered with &s;cales. The&s;e toes are of unequal
&s;izes. The large&s;t, which is on the in&s;ide, is &s;even inches long,
including the claw, which is near three fourths of an inch in length, and
almo&s;t as broad. The other toe is but four inches long, and is without a
claw.</P>
<P>The internal parts of this animal are formed with no le&s;s
&s;urprizing peculiarity. At the top of the brea&s;t, under the &s;kin, the fat
is two inches thick; and on the fore-part of the belly, it is as hard as
&s;uet, and about two inches and an half thick in &s;ome places. It has two
di&s;tinct &s;tomachs. The fir&s;t, which is lowermo&s;t, in 
<PB N="53" REF="59"> its natural &s;ituation &s;omewhat re&s;embles the crop in
other birds; but it is con&s;iderably larger than the other &s;tomach, and is
furni&s;hed with &s;trong mu&s;cular fibres, as well circular as lon|gitudinal.
The &s;econd &s;tomach, or gizzard, has outwardly the &s;hape of the &s;tomach
of a man; and upon opening is always found filled with a variety of
di&s;cordant &s;ub&s;tances; hay, gra&s;s, barley, beans, bones, and &s;tones,
&s;ome of which exceed in &s;ize a pullet's egg. The kidneys are eight inches
long and two broad, and differ from tho&s;e of other birds in not being divided
into lobes. The heart and lungs are &s;eparated by a midriff, as in
quadrupedes; and the parts of generation al&s;o bear a very &s;trong
re&s;emblance and analogy.</P>
<P>Such is the &s;tructure of this animal forming the &s;hade that
unites birds and quadrupedes; and from this &s;tructure its habits and manners
are entirely peculiar. It is a native only of the torrid regions of Africa, and
has long been celebrated by tho&s;e who have had occa&s;ion to mention the
animals of that region. Its fle&s;h is pro&s;cribed in Scripture as unfit to be
eaten; and mo&s;t of the ancient writers de&s;cribe it as well known in their
times. Like the race of the elephant, it is tran&s;mitted down without mixture;
and has never been known to breed <PB N="54" REF="60"> out of that country
which fir&s;t produced it. It &s;eems formed to live among the &s;andy and
burn|ing de&s;arts of the torrid zone; and, as in &s;ome mea&s;ure it owes its
birth to their genial in|fluence, &s;o it &s;eldom migrates into tracts more
mild or more fertile. As that is the peculiar country of the elephant, the
rhinoceros, and camel, &s;o it may readily be &s;uppo&s;ed capable of affording
a retreat to the o&s;trich. They inhabit from preference the mo&s;t &s;olitary
and horrid de|&s;erts, where there are few vegetables to cloath the &s;urface
of the earth, and where the rain never comes to refre&s;h it. The Arabians
a&s;&s;ert that the o&s;trich never drinks; and the place of its ha|bitation
&s;eems to confirm the a&s;&s;ertion. In the&s;e formidable regions,
o&s;triches are &s;een in large flocks, which to the di&s;tant &s;pectator
appear like a regiment of cavalry, and have often alarmed a whole caravan.
There is no de&s;ert, how barren &s;oever, but what is capable of &s;upplying
the&s;e animals with provi&s;ion; they eat almo&s;t every thing; and the&s;e
barren tracts are thus doubly grateful, as they afford both food and
&s;ecurity. The o&s;trich is of all other animals the mo&s;t voracious. It will
devour leather, gra&s;s, hair, iron, &s;tones, or any thing that is given. Nor
are its powers of dige&s;tion le&s;s in &s;uch things as are dige&s;tible.
Tho&s;e &s;ub&s;tances which the <PB N="55" REF="61"> coats of the &s;tomach
cannot &s;often, pa&s;s whole; &s;o that gla&s;s, &s;tones, or iron, are
excluded in the form in which they were devoured. All metals, indeed, which are
&s;wallowed by any animal, lo&s;e a part of their weight, and often the
extremities of their figure, from the action of the juices of the &s;tomach
upon their &s;urface. A quarter pi&s;tole, which was &s;wallowed by a duck,
lo&s;t &s;even grains of its weight in the gizzard before it was voided; and it
is pro|bable that a &s;till greater diminution of weight would happen in the
&s;tomach of an o&s;trich; con&s;idered in this light, therefore, this animal
may be &s;aid to dige&s;t iron; but &s;uch &s;ub&s;tances &s;eldom remain long
enough in the &s;tomach of any animal to undergo &s;o tedious a
di&s;&s;olution. However this be, the o&s;trich &s;wallows almo&s;t every thing
pre&s;ented to it. Whether this be from the nece&s;&s;ity which &s;maller birds
are under of picking up gravel to keep the coats of their &s;tomach a&s;under,
or whether it be from a want of di&s;tingui&s;hing by the ta&s;te what
&s;ub&s;tances are fit and what incapable of dige&s;tion; certain it is, that
in the o&s;trich di&s;&s;ected by Ranby there appeared &s;uch a quantity of
heterogeneous &s;ub|&s;tances, that it was wonderful how any animal could
dige&s;t &s;uch an overcharge of nouri&s;hment. Vali&s;nieri al&s;o found the
fir&s;t &s;tomach filled with <PB N="56" REF="62"> a quantity of incongruous
&s;ub&s;tances; gra&s;s, nuts, cords, &s;tones, gla&s;s, bra&s;s, copper, iron,
tin, lead, and wood; a piece of &s;tone was found among the re&s;t that weighed
more than a pound. He &s;aw one of the&s;e animals that was killed by devouring
a quantity of quick-lime. It would &s;eem that the o&s;trich is obliged to fill
up the great capacity of its &s;tomach in order to be at ea&s;e; but that
nutritious &s;ub&s;tances not oc|curring, it pours in whatever offers to
&s;upply the void.</P>
<P>In their native de&s;erts, however, it is probable they live
chiefly upon vegetables, where they lead an inoffen&s;ive and &s;ocial life;
the male, as Thevenot a&s;&s;ures us, a&s;&s;orting with the female with
connubial fidelity. They are &s;aid to be very much inclined to venery; and the
make of the parts in both &s;exes &s;eems to confirm the re|port. It is
probable al&s;o they copulate, like other birds, by compre&s;&s;ion; and they
lay very large eggs, &s;ome of them being above five inches in diameter, and
weighing above fifteen pounds. The&s;e eggs have a very hard &s;hell,
&s;omewhat re&s;embling tho&s;e of the crocodile, except that tho&s;e of the
latter are le&s;s and rounder.</P>
<P>The &s;ea&s;on for laying depends on the climate where the
animal is bred. In the northern parts <PB N="57" REF="63"> of Africa, this
&s;ea&s;on is about the beginning of July; in the &s;outh, it is about the
latter end of December. The&s;e birds are very prolific, and lay generally from
forty to fifty eggs at one clutch. It has been commonly reported that the
female depo&s;its them in the &s;and; and, covering them up, leaves them to be
hatched by the heat of the climate, and then permits the young to &s;hift for
them&s;elves. Very little of this however is true: no bird has a &s;tronger
affection for her young than the o&s;trich, nor none watches her eggs with
greater a&s;&s;iduity. It happens, indeed, in tho&s;e hot climates, that there
is le&s;s nece&s;&s;ity for the continual incuba|tion of the female; and &s;he
more frequently leaves her eggs, which are in no fear of being chilled by the
weather: but though &s;he &s;ome|times for&s;akes them by day, &s;he always
carefully broods over them by night; and Kolben, who has &s;een great numbers
of them at the Cape of Good Hope, affirms that they &s;it on their eggs like
other birds, and that the male and female take this office by turns, as he had
frequent opportunities of ob&s;erving. Nor is it more true what is &s;aid of
their for&s;aking their young after they are excluded the &s;hell. On the
contrary, the young ones are not even able to walk for &s;everal days after
they are hatched. During this <PB N="58" REF="64"> time, the old ones are very
a&s;&s;iduous in &s;upplying them with gra&s;s, and very careful to defend them
from danger: nay, they encounter every danger in their defence. It was a way of
take|ing them among the ancients, to plant a number of &s;harp &s;takes round
the o&s;trich's ne&s;t in her ab&s;ence, upon which &s;he pierced her&s;elf at
her return. The young, when brought forth, are of an a&s;h colour the fir&s;t
year, and are covered with feathers all over. But in time the&s;e fea|thers
drop; and tho&s;e parts which are covered a&s;&s;ume a different and more
becoming plumage.</P>
<P>The beauty of a part of this plumage, par|ticularly the long
feathers that compo&s;e the wings and tail, is the chief rea&s;on that man has
been &s;o active in pur&s;uing this harmle&s;s bird to its de&s;erts, and
hunting it with no &s;mall degree of expence and labour. The ancients u&s;ed
tho&s;e plumes in their helmets; the ladies of the ea&s;t make them an ornament
in their dre&s;s; and among us, our undertakers and our fine gentle|men &s;till
make u&s;e of them to decorate their hear&s;es and their hats. Tho&s;e feathers
which are plucked from the animal while alive are much more valued than tho&s;e
taken when dead, the latter being dry, light, and &s;ubject to be
worm-eaten.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide the value of their plumage, &s;ome of 
<PB N="59" REF="65"> the &s;avage nations of Africa, hunt them al&s;o for their
fle&s;h; which they con&s;ider as a dainty. They &s;ometimes al&s;o breed
the&s;e birds tame to eat the young ones, of which the female is &s;aid to be
the greate&s;t delicacy. Some nations have obtained the name of Struthophagi,
or O&s;trich|eaters, from their peculiar fondne&s;s for this food; and even the
Romans them&s;elves were not aver&s;e to it. Apicius gives us a receipt for
making &s;auce for the o&s;trich; and Heliogabalus is noted for having
dre&s;&s;ed the brains of &s;ix hundred o&s;triches in one di&s;h; for it was
his cu&s;tom never to eat but of one di&s;h in a day, but that was an
expen&s;ive one. Even among the Europeans now, the eggs of the o&s;trich are
&s;aid to be well ta&s;ted, and extremely nouri&s;hing; but they are too
&s;carce to be fed upon, al|though a &s;ingle egg be a &s;ufficient
entertainment for eight men.</P>
<P>As the &s;poils of the o&s;trich are thus valuable, it is not to
be wondered at that man has become their mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous pur&s;uer. For
this purpo&s;e, the Arabians train up their be&s;t and fleete&s;t hor&s;es, and
hunt the o&s;trich &s;till in view. Per|haps, of all other varieties of the
cha&s;e, this, though the mo&s;t laborious, is yet the mo&s;t en|tertaining. As
&s;oon as the hunter comes within <PB N="60" REF="66"> &s;ight of his prey, he
puts on his hor&s;e with a gentle gallop, &s;o as to keep the o&s;trich &s;till
in &s;ight; yet not &s;o as to terrify him from the plain into the mountains.
Of all known animals that make u&s;e of their legs in running, the o&s;trich is
by far the &s;wifte&s;t: upon ob&s;erving him&s;elf therefore pur&s;ued at a
di&s;tance, he begins to run at fir&s;t but gently; either in&s;en&s;ible of
his danger, or &s;ure of e&s;caping. In this &s;ituation he &s;omewhat
re&s;embles a man at full &s;peed; his wings, like two arms, keep working with
a motion corre&s;pondent to that of his legs; and his &s;peed would very &s;oon
&s;natch him from the view of his pur&s;uers, but, unfortunately for the
&s;illy creature, in&s;tead of going off in a direct line, he takes his
cour&s;e in circles; while the hunters &s;till make a &s;mall cour&s;e within,
relieve each other, meet him at unexpected turns, and keep him thus &s;till
employed, &s;till followed for two or three days together. At la&s;t, &s;pent
with fatigue and famine, and finding all power of e&s;cape impo&s;&s;ible, he
endeavours to hide him&s;elf from tho&s;e enemies he cannot avoid, and covers
his head in the &s;and, or the fir&s;t thicket he meets. Sometimes, however, he
attempts to face his pur&s;uers; and, though in general the mo&s;t gentle
animal in nature, when driven to de&s;peration, he defends him&s;elf with 
<PB N="61" REF="67"> his beak, his wings and his feet. Such is the force of his
motion, that a man would be ut|terly unable to with&s;tand him in the
&s;hock.</P>
<P>The Struthophagi have another method of taking this bird: they
cover them&s;elves with an o&s;trich's &s;kin, and pa&s;&s;ing up an arm
through the neck, thus counterfeit all the motions of this animal. By this
artifice they approach the o&s;trich, which becomes an ea&s;y prey. He is
&s;ometimes al&s;o taken by dogs and nets: but the mo&s;t u&s;ual way is that
mentioned above.</P>
<P>When the Arabians have thus taken an o&s;trich, they cut its
throat, and making a liga|ture below the opening, they &s;hake the bird, as one
would rin&s;e a barrel: then taking off the ligature, there runs out from the
wound in the throat, a con&s;iderable quantity of blood, mixed with the fat of
the animal; and this is con&s;idered as one of their greate&s;t dainties. They
next flea the bird; and of the &s;kin, which is &s;trong and thick, &s;ometimes
make a kind of ve&s;t, which an&s;wers the purpo&s;es of a cuira&s;s and a
buckler.</P>
<P>There are others who, more compa&s;&s;ionate or more provident,
do not kill their captive, but endeavour to tame it, for the purpo&s;es of
&s;up|plying tho&s;e feathers which are in &s;o great re|que&s;t. The
inhabitants of Dara and Lybia breed up whole flocks of them, and they are tamed
<PB N="62" REF="68"> with very little trouble. But it is not for their feathers
alone that they are prized in this do|me&s;tic &s;tate; they are often ridden
upon, and u&s;ed as hor&s;es. Moore a&s;&s;ures us, that at Joar he &s;aw a man
travelling upon an o&s;trich; and Adan&s;on a&s;&s;erts that, at the factory of
Podore, he had two o&s;triches, which were then young, the &s;tronge&s;t of
which ran &s;wifter than the be&s;t Engli&s;h racer, although he carried two
Negroes on his back. As &s;oon as the animal perceived that it was thus loaded,
it &s;et off running with all its force, and made &s;everal circuits round the
village; till at length the people were obliged to &s;top it, by barring up the
way. How far this &s;trength and &s;wiftne&s;s may be u&s;eful to mankind, even
in a poli&s;hed &s;tate, is a matter that perhaps de&s;erves enquiry.
Po&s;terity may avail them&s;elves of this creature's abilities; and riding
upon an o&s;trich may one day become the favourite, as it mo&s;t certainly is
the &s;wifte&s;t, mode of conveyance.</P>
<P>The parts of this animal are &s;aid to be con|vertible to many
&s;alutary purpo&s;es in medicine. The fat is &s;aid to be emollient and
relaxing; that while it relaxes the tendons, it fortifies the nervous
&s;y&s;tem; and being applied to the region of the loins, it abates the pains
of the &s;tone in the kidney. The &s;hell of the egg powdered, 
<PB N="63" REF="69"> and given in proper quantities, is &s;aid to be u&s;eful
in promoting urine, and di&s;&s;olving the &s;tone in the bladder. The
&s;ub&s;tance of the egg it&s;elf is thought to be peculiarly nouri&s;hing:
however, Galen, in mentioning this, a&s;&s;erts, that the eggs of hens and
phea&s;ants are good to be eaten; tho&s;e of gee&s;e and o&s;triches are the
wor&s;t of all.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. The Emu.</HEAD>
<P>OF this bird, which many call the American O&s;trich, but little
is certainly known. It is an inhabitant of the New Continent; and the
tra|vellers who have mentioned it, &s;eem to have been more &s;olicitous in
proving its affinity to the o&s;trich, than in de&s;cribing tho&s;e
peculiarities which di&s;tingui&s;h it from all others of the fea|thered
creation.</P>
<P>It is chiefly found in Guiana, along the banks of the Oroonoko,
in the inland provinces of Bra&s;il and Chili, and the va&s;t fore&s;ts that
border on the mouth of the river Plata. Many other parts of South America were
known to have them; but as men multiplied, the&s;e large and timorous birds
either fell beneath their &s;uperior power, or fled from their vicinity.</P>
<P>The Emu, though not &s;o large as the o&s;trich, is only
&s;econd to it in magnitude. It is by much the large&s;t bird in the New
Continent; and is generally found to be &s;ix feet high, mea|&s;uring from its
head to the ground. Its legs are three feet long; and its thigh is near as
thick as that of a man. The toes differ from tho&s;e <PB N="65" REF="71"> of
the o&s;trich; as there are three in the Ame|rican bird, and but two in the
former. Its neck is long, its head &s;mall, and the bill flat|ted, like that of
the o&s;trich; but, in all other re&s;pects, it more re&s;embles a
Ca&s;&s;owary, a large bird, to be de&s;cribed hereafter. The form of the body
appears round; the wings are &s;hort, and entirely unfitted for flying, and it
entirely wants a tail. It is covered from the back and rump with long feathers,
which fall backward, and cover the anus: the&s;e feathers are grey upon the
back, and white on the belly. It goes very &s;wiftly, and &s;eems
a&s;&s;i&s;ted in its motion by a kind of tubercle behind, like an heel, upon
which, on plain ground, it treads very &s;ecurely: in its cour&s;e it u&s;es a
very odd kind of action, lifting up one wing, which it keeps elevated for a
time; till letting it drop, it lifts up the other. What the bird's intention
may be in thus keeping only one wing up, is not ea&s;y to di&s;cover; whe|ther
it makes u&s;e of this as a &s;ail to catch the wind, or whether as a rudder to
turn its cour&s;e, in order to avoid the arrows of the Indians, yet remains to
be a&s;certained: however this be, the emu runs with &s;uch a &s;wiftne&s;s,
that the fleete&s;t dogs are thrown out in the pur&s;uit. One of them, finding
it&s;elf &s;urrounded by the hunters, darted among the dogs with &s;uch fury
that they <PB N="66" REF="72"> made way to avoid its rage; and it e&s;caped, by
its amazing velocity, in &s;afety to the mountains.</P>
<P>As this bird is but little known, &s;o travellers have given a
loo&s;e to their imaginations in de|&s;cribing &s;ome of its actions, which
they were con&s;cious could not be ea&s;ily contradicted. This animal, &s;ays
Nierenberg, is very peculiar in the hatching of its young. The male com|pels
twenty or thirty of the females to lay their eggs in one ne&s;t; he then, when
they have done laying, cha&s;es them away, and places him&s;elf upon the eggs;
however, he takes the &s;ingular precaution of laying two of the number
a&s;ide, which he does not &s;it upon. When the young ones come forth, the&s;e
two eggs are addled; which the male having fore&s;een, breaks one, and then
another, upon which multitudes of flies are found to &s;ettle; and the&s;e
&s;upply the young brood with a &s;ufficiency of provi&s;ion, till they are
able to &s;hift for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>On the other hand, Wafer a&s;&s;erts, that he has &s;een great
quantities of this animal's eggs on the de&s;ert &s;hores, north of the river
Plata; where they were buried in the &s;and, in order to be hatched by the heat
of the climate. Both this, as well as the preceding account, may be doubted:
and it is more probable that it was the crocodile's eggs which Wafer had
&s;een, which are undoubtedly hatched in that manner.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="73">When the young ones are hatched, they are
familiar, and follow the fir&s;t per&s;on they meet. I have been followed
my&s;elf, &s;ays Wafer, by many of the&s;e young o&s;triches; which, at
fir&s;t, are extremely harmle&s;s and &s;imple: but as they grow older, they
become more cunning and di&s;tru&s;tful; and run &s;o &s;wift, that a greyhound
can &s;carcely overtake them. Their fle&s;h, in general, is good to be eaten;
e&s;pecially if they be young. It would be no difficult matter to rear up
flocks of the&s;e animals tame, particularly as they are naturally &s;o
familiar: and they might be found to an&s;wer dome&s;tic purpo&s;es, like the
hen, or the turkey. Their maintenance could not be expen&s;ive, if, as
Narborough &s;ays, they live entirely upon gra&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. The Ca&s;&s;owary.</HEAD>
<P>THE Ca&s;&s;owary is a bird which was fir&s;t brought into
Europe by the Dutch, from Java, in the Ea&s;t-Indies, in which part of the
world it is only to be found. Next to the preceding, it is the large&s;t and
the heavie&s;t of the feathered &s;pecies.</P>
<P>The ca&s;&s;owary, though not &s;o large as the former, yet
appears more bulky to the eye; its body being nearly equal, and its neck and
legs much thicker and &s;tronger in proportion; this conformation gives it an
air of &s;trength and force, which the fiercene&s;s and &s;ingularity of its
countenance con&s;pire to render formidable. It is five feet and an half long,
from the point of the bill to the extremity of the claws. The legs are two feet
and an half high, from the belly to the end of the claws. The head and neck
to|gether are a foot and an half; and the large&s;t toe, including the claw, is
five inches long. The claw alone of the lea&s;t toe, is three inches and a half
in length. The wing is &s;o &s;mall, that it does not appear; it being hid
under the feathers of the back. In other birds, a part of <PB N="69" REF="77">
the feathers &s;erve for flight, and are different from tho&s;e that &s;erve
for merely covering; but in the ca&s;&s;owary, all the feathers are of the
&s;ame kind, and outwardly of the &s;ame colour. They are generally double;
having two long &s;hafts, which grow out of a &s;hort one, which is fixed in
the &s;kin. Tho&s;e that are double, are always of an unequal length; for
&s;ome are fourteen inches long, particularly on the rump; while others are not
above three. The beards that adorn the &s;tem or &s;haft, are from about half
way to the end, very long, and as thick as an hor&s;e hair, without being
&s;ubdivided into fibres. The &s;tem or &s;haft is flat, &s;hining, black, and
knotted below; and from each knot there pro|ceeds a beard: likewi&s;e, the
beards at the end of the large feathers are perfectly black; and towards the
root of a grey tawny colour; &s;horter, more &s;oft, and throwing out fine
fibres, like down; &s;o that nothing appears except the ends, which are hard
and black; becau&s;e the other part, compo&s;ed of down, is quite covered.
There are feathers on the head and neck; but they are &s;o &s;hort, and thinly
&s;own, that the bird's &s;kin appears naked, except towards the hinder part of
the head, where they are a little longer. The feathers which adorn the rump,
are extremely thick; but do not differ, in other <PB N="70" REF="78">
re&s;pects, from the re&s;t, excepting their being longer. The wings, when they
are deprived of their feathers, are but three inches long; and the feathers are
like tho&s;e on other parts of the body. The ends of the wings are adorned with
five prickles, of different lengths and thickne&s;s, which bend like a bow:
the&s;e are hollow from the roots to the very points, having only that &s;light
&s;ub&s;tance within which all quills are known to have. The longe&s;t of
the&s;e prickles is eleven inches; and it is a quarter of an inch in diameter
at the root, being thicker there than towards the extremity; the point &s;eems
broken off.</P>
<P>The part, however, which mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hes this animal is
the head; which, though &s;mall, like that of an o&s;trich, does not fail to
in&s;pire &s;ome degree of terror. It is bare of feathers, and is in a manner
armed with an helmet of horny &s;ub&s;tance, that covers it from the root of
the bill to near half the head backwards. This helmet is black before and
yellow behind. Its &s;ub&s;tance is very hard, being formed by the elevation of
the bone of the &s;kull; and it con&s;i&s;ts of &s;everal plates, one over
another, like the horn of an ox. Some have &s;uppo&s;ed that this was &s;hed
every year with the feathers; but the mo&s;t probable opinion is, that it only
ex|foliates <PB N="71" REF="79"> &s;lowly like the beak. To the peculiar oddity
of this natural armour may be added the colour of the eye in this animal, which
is a bright yellow, and the globe being above an inch and an half in diameter,
give it an air equally fierce and extraordinary. At the bot|tom of the upper
eye-lid, there is a row of &s;mall hairs, over which there is another row of
black hair, which look pretty much like an eye-brow. The lower eye-lid, which
is the large&s;t of the two, is furni&s;hed al&s;o with plenty of black hair.
The hole of the ear is very large and open, being only covered with &s;mall
black feathers. The &s;ides of the head, about the eye and ear, being
de&s;titute of any covering, are blue, except the middle of the lower eye-lid,
which is white. The part of the bill which an&s;wers to the upper jaw in other
animals, is very hard at the edges above, and the extremity of it like that of
a turkey-cock. The end of the lower mandible is &s;lightly notched, and the
whole is of a greyi&s;h brown, except a green &s;pot on each &s;ide. As the
beak admits a very wide opening, this con|tributes not a little to the bird's
menacing ap|pearance. The neck is of a violet colour, in|clining to that of
&s;late; and it is red behind in &s;everal places, but chiefly in the middle.
About the middle of the neck before, at the ri&s;e of the <PB N="72" REF="80">
large feathers, there are two proce&s;&s;es formed by the &s;kin, which
re&s;emble &s;omewhat the gills of a cock, but that they are blue as well as
red. The &s;kin which covers the fore-part of the brea&s;t, on which this bird
leans and re&s;ts, is hard, callous, and without feathers. The thighs and legs
are covered with feathers, and are ex|tremely thick, &s;trong, &s;traight, and
covered with &s;cales of &s;everal &s;hapes; but the legs are thicker a little
above the foot than in any other place. The toes are likewi&s;e covered with
&s;cales, and are but three in number; for that which &s;hould be behind is
wanting. The claws are of a hard &s;olid &s;ub&s;tance, black without and white
within.</P>
<P>The internal parts are equally remarkable. The ca&s;&s;owary
unites with the double &s;tomach of animals that live upon vegetables, the
&s;hort inte&s;tines of tho&s;e that live upon fle&s;h. The in|te&s;tines of
the ca&s;&s;owary are thirteen times &s;horter than tho&s;e of the o&s;trich.
The heart is very &s;mall, being but an inch and an half long, and an inch
broad at the ba&s;e. Upon the whole, it has the head of a warrior, the eye of a
lion, the defence of a porcupine, and the &s;wiftne&s;s of a cour&s;er.</P>
<P>Thus formed for a life of ho&s;tility, for ter|rifying others,
and for its own defence, it might be expected that the ca&s;&s;owary was one of
the <PB N="73" REF="81"> mo&s;t fierce and terrible animals of the creation.
But nothing is &s;o oppo&s;ite to its natural character, nothing &s;o different
from the life it is contented to lead. It never attacks others; and in&s;tead
of the bill, when attacked, it rather makes u&s;e of its legs, and kicks like
an hor&s;e, or runs again&s;t its pur&s;uer, beats him down, and treads him to
the ground.</P>
<P>The manner of going of this animal is not le&s;s extraordinary
than its appearance. In&s;tead of going directly forward, it &s;eems to kick up
behind with one leg, and then making a bound onward with the other, it goes
with &s;uch pro|digious velocity, that the &s;wifte&s;t racer would be left far
behind.</P>
<P>The &s;ame degree of voraciou&s;ne&s;s which we perceived in the
o&s;trich, obtains as &s;trongly here. The ca&s;&s;owary &s;wallows every thing
that comes within the capacity of its gullet. The Dutch a&s;&s;ert that it can
devour not only gla&s;s, iron, and &s;tones, but even live and burning coals,
without te&s;tifying the &s;malle&s;t fear, or feeling the lea&s;t injury. It
is &s;aid that the pa&s;&s;age of the food through its gullet is performed &s;o
&s;peedily, that even the very eggs which it has &s;wallowed whole pa&s;s
through it unbroken, in the &s;ame form they went down. In fact, the alimentary
canal of this animal, as was ob&s;erved <PB N="74" REF="82"> above, is
extremely &s;hort; and it may happen that many kinds of food are indige&s;tible
in its &s;tomach, as wheat or currants are to man, when &s;wallowed whole.</P>
<P>The ca&s;&s;owary's eggs are of a grey a&s;h colour, inclining
to green. They are not &s;o large nor &s;o round as tho&s;e of the o&s;trich.
They are marked with a number of little tubercles of a deep green, and the
&s;hell is not very thick. The large&s;t of the&s;e is found to be fifteen
inches round one way, and about twelve the other.</P>
<P>The &s;outhern parts of the mo&s;t ea&s;tern Indies &s;eems to
be the natural climate of the ca&s;&s;owary. His domain, if we may &s;o call
it, begins where that of the o&s;trich terminates. The latter has never been
found beyond the Ganges; while the ca&s;&s;owary is never &s;een nearer than
the i&s;lands of Banda, Sumatra, Java, the Molucca I&s;lands, and the
corre&s;ponding parts of the continent. Yet even here this animal &s;eems not
to have multiplied in any con&s;iderable degree, as we find one of the kings of
Java making a pre&s;ent of one of the&s;e birds to the captain of a Dutch
&s;hip, con&s;idering it as a very great rarity. The o&s;trich, that has kept
in the de&s;ert and unpeopled regions of Africa, is &s;till numerous, and the
unrivalled tenant of its own inho&s;pitable cli|mate. But the ca&s;&s;owary,
that is the inhabi|tant <PB REF="83">

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. The Dodo.</HEAD>
<P>MANKIND have generally made &s;wiftne&s;s the attribute of
birds; but the Dodo has no title to this di&s;tinction. In&s;tead of exciting
the idea of &s;wiftne&s;s by its appearance, it &s;eems to &s;trike the
imagination as a thing the mo&s;t un|wieldy and inactive of all nature. Its
body is ma&s;&s;ive, almo&s;t round, and covered with grey feathers; it is
ju&s;t barely &s;upported upon two &s;hort thick legs like pillars, while its
head and neck ri&s;e from it in a manner truly grote&s;que. The neck, thick and
pur&s;y, is joined to the head, which con&s;i&s;ts of two great chaps, that
open far behind the eyes, which are large, black and pro|minent; &s;o that the
animal when it gapes &s;eems to be all mouth. The bill therefore is of an
ex|traordinary length, not flat and broad, but thick, and of a blui&s;h white,
&s;harp at the end, and each chap crooked in oppo&s;ite directions. They
re|&s;emble two pointed &s;poons that are laid together by the backs. From all
this re&s;ults a &s;tupid and voracious phy&s;iognomy; which is &s;till more
en|crea&s;ed by a bordering of feathers round the root of the beak, and which

animals implies &s;trength, in this only contributes to inactivity. The
o&s;trich, or the ca&s;&s;owary, are no more able to fly than the animal before
us; but then they &s;upply that defect by their &s;peed in running. The dodo
&s;eems weighed down by its own hea|vine&s;s, and has &s;carce &s;trength to
urge it&s;elf forward. It &s;eems among birds what the &s;loth is among
quadrupedes, an unre&s;i&s;ting thing, equally incapable of flight or defence.
It is furni&s;hed with wings, covered with &s;oft a&s;h-coloured feathers, but
they are too &s;hort to a&s;&s;i&s;t it in flying. It is furni&s;hed with a
tail, with a few &s;mall curled feathers; but this tail is di&s;|proportioned
and di&s;placed. Its legs are too &s;hort for running, and its body too fat to
be &s;trong. One would take it for a tortoi&s;e that had &s;upplied it&s;elf
with the feathers of a bird; and that thus dre&s;&s;ed out with the
in&s;truments of flight, it was only &s;till the more unwieldy.</P>
<P>This bird is a native of the I&s;le of France; and the Dutch,
who fir&s;t di&s;covered it there, called it in their language the
<HI>nau&s;eous bird,</HI> as well from its di&s;gu&s;ting figure as from the
bad ta&s;te of its fle&s;h. However, &s;ucceeding ob&s;ervers contradict this
fir&s;t report, and a&s;&s;ert that its fle&s;h is good and whole&s;ome eating.
It is a &s;illy <PB N="78" REF="92"> &s;imple bird, as may very well be
&s;uppo&s;ed from its figure, and is very ea&s;ily taken. Three or four dodos
are enough to dine an hundred men.</P>
<P>Whether the dodo be the &s;ame bird with that which &s;ome
travellers have de&s;cribed under the bird of Nazareth, yet remains uncertain.
The country from whence they both come is the &s;ame; their incapacity of
flying is the &s;ame; the form of the wings and body in both are &s;imilar; but
the chief difference given is in the colour of the feathers, which in the
female of the bird of Nazareth are &s;aid to be extremely beautiful; and in the
length of their legs, which in the dodo are &s;hort; in the other, are
de&s;cribed as long. Time and future ob&s;ervation mu&s;t clear up the&s;e
doubts; and the te&s;timony of a &s;ingle witne&s;s, who &s;hall have &s;een

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. Of Rapacious Birds in General.</HEAD>
<P>THERE &s;eems to obtain a general re&s;em|blance in all the
cla&s;&s;es of nature. As among quadrupedes a part were &s;een to live upon the
vegetable productions of the earth, and another part upon the fle&s;h of each
other, &s;o among birds; &s;ome live upon vegetable food, and others by rapine,
de&s;troying all &s;uch as &s;uch as want force or &s;wiftne&s;s to procure
their &s;afety. By thus peopling the woods with animals of different
di&s;po&s;itions, Nature has wi&s;ely pro|vided for the multiplication of life;
&s;ince, could we &s;uppo&s;e that there were as many ani|mals produced as
there were vegetables &s;upplied to &s;u&s;tain them, yet there might &s;till
be another cla&s;s of animals formed, which could find a &s;ufficient
&s;u&s;tenance by feeding upon &s;uch of the vegetable feeders as happened to
fall by the cour&s;e of nature. By this contrivance, a greater number will be
&s;u&s;tained upon the whole; for the numbers would be but very thin were every
creature a candidate for the &s;ame food. Thus, by &s;upplying a variety of
appetites, Nature has al&s;o multiplied life in her productions.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="94">In thus varying their appetites, Nature has
al&s;o varied the form of the animal; and while &s;he has given &s;ome an
in&s;tinctive pa&s;&s;ion for animal food, &s;he has al&s;o furni&s;hed them
with powers to obtain it. All land-birds of the ra|pacious kinds are
furni&s;hed with a large head, and a &s;trong crooked beak, notched at the end,
for the purpo&s;e of tearing their prey. They have &s;trong &s;hort legs, and
&s;harp crooked talons for the purpo&s;e of &s;eizing it. Their bodies are
formed for war, being fibrous and mu&s;cular; and their wings for &s;wiftne&s;s
of flight, being well feathered and expan&s;ive. The &s;ight of &s;uch as prey
by day is a&s;toni&s;hingly quick; and &s;uch as ravage by night, have their
&s;ight &s;o fitted as to &s;ee objects in darkne&s;s with extreme
preci&s;ion.</P>
<P>Their internal parts are equally formed for the food they &s;eek
for. Their &s;tomach is &s;imple and membranous, and wrapped in fat to
encrea&s;e the powers of dige&s;tion; and their inte&s;tines are &s;hort and
glandular. As their food is &s;uc|culent and juicy, they want no length of
inte|&s;tinal tube to form it into proper nouri&s;hment. Their food is fle&s;h;
which does not require a &s;low dige&s;tion, to be converted into a
&s;imilitude of &s;ub&s;tance to their own.</P>
<P>Thus formed for war, they lead a life of &s;o|litude 
<PB N="81" REF="95"> and rapacity. They inhabit, by choice, the mo&s;t lonely
places and the mo&s;t de&s;ert mountains. They make their ne&s;ts in the clefts
of rocks, and on the highe&s;t and mo&s;t inacce&s;|&s;ible trees of the
fore&s;t. Whenever they appear in the cultivated plain, or the warbling grove,
it is only for the purpo&s;es of depredation; and are gloomy intruders on the
general joy of the land&s;cape. They &s;pread terror wherever they approach:
all that variety of mu&s;ic which but a moment before enlivened the grove, at
their appearing is in&s;tantly at an end: every order of le&s;&s;er birds
&s;eek for &s;afety, either by con|cealment or flight; and &s;ome are even
driven to take protection with man, to avoid their le&s;s merciful
pur&s;uers.</P>
<P>It would indeed be fatal to all the &s;maller race of birds, if,
as they are weaker than all, they were al&s;o pur&s;ued by all; but it is
con|trived wi&s;ely for their &s;afety, that every order of carnivorous birds
&s;eek only for &s;uch as are of the &s;ize mo&s;t approaching their own. The
ea|gle flies at the bu&s;tard or the phea&s;ant; the &s;parrow-hawk pur&s;ues
the thru&s;h and the lin|net. Nature has provided that each &s;pecies &s;hould
make war only on &s;uch as are furni&s;hed with adequate means of e&s;cape. The
&s;malle&s;t birds avoid their pur&s;uers by the extreme agi|lity, 
<PB N="82" REF="96"> rather than the &s;wiftne&s;s of their flight; for every
order would &s;oon be at an end, if the eagle, to its own &s;wiftne&s;s of
wing, added the ver&s;ality of the &s;parrow.</P>
<P>Another circum&s;tance which tends to render the tyranny of
the&s;e animals more &s;upportable is, that they are le&s;s fruitful than other
birds; breeding but few at a time. Tho&s;e of the larger kind &s;eldom produce
above four eggs, often but two; tho&s;e of the &s;maller kinds, never above
&s;ix or &s;even. The pigeon, it is true, that is their prey, never breeds
above two at a time; but then &s;he breeds every month in the year. The
carnivorous kinds only breed annually, and of con&s;equence their fecundity is
&s;mall in com|pari&s;on.</P>
<P>As they are fierce by nature, and are difficult to be tamed,
&s;o this fiercene&s;s extends even to their young, which they force from the
ne&s;t &s;ooner than birds of the gentler kind. Other birds &s;eldom for&s;ake
their young till able, com|pletely, to provide for them&s;elves; the rapacious
kinds expel them from the ne&s;t at a time when they &s;till &s;hould protect
and &s;upport them. This &s;everity to their young proceeds from the
nece&s;&s;ity of providing for them&s;elves. All animals that, by the
conformation of their &s;tomach and inte&s;tines, are obliged to live upon
fle&s;h, and <PB N="83" REF="97"> &s;upport them&s;elves by prey, though they
may be mild when young, &s;oon become fierce and mi&s;chievous, by the very
habit of u&s;ing tho&s;e arms with which they are &s;upplied by Nature. As it
is only by the de&s;truction of other animals that they can &s;ub&s;i&s;t, they
become more furious every day; and even the parental feelings are overpowered
in their general habits of cruelty. If the power of obtaining a &s;upply be
difficult, the old ones &s;oon drive their brood from the ne&s;t to &s;hift for
them&s;elves, and often de&s;troy them in a fit of fury cau&s;ed by hunger.</P>
<P>Another effect of this natural and acquired &s;everity is, that
almo&s;t all birds of prey are un&s;ociable. It has long been ob&s;erved, by
Ari&s;totle, that all birds, with crooked beaks and talons, are &s;olitary:
like quadrupedes of the cat kind, they lead a lonely wandering life, and are
united only in pairs, by that in&s;tinct which overpowers their rapacious
habits of enmity with all other animals. As the male and female are often
nece&s;&s;ary to each other in their pur&s;uits, &s;o they &s;ometimes live
together; but, except at certain &s;ea&s;ons, they mo&s;t u&s;ually prowl
alone; and, like robbers, enjoy in &s;o|litude the fruits of their plunder.</P>
<P>All birds of prey are remarkable for one <PB N="84" REF="98">
&s;ingularity, for which it is not ea&s;y to account. All the males of the&s;e
birds are about a third le&s;s, and weaker than the females; contrary to what
obtains among quadrupedes, among which the males are always the large&s;t and
bolde&s;t: from thence the male is called, by falconers, a <HI>tarcel</HI>;
that is, a tierce or third le&s;s than the other. The rea&s;on of this
difference cannot proceed from the nece&s;&s;ity of a larger body in the
fe|male for the purpo&s;es of breeding, and that her volume is thus encrea&s;ed
by the quantity of her eggs; for in other birds, that breed much fa&s;ter, and
that lay in much greater proportion, &s;uch as the hen, the duck, or the
phea&s;ant, the male is by much the large&s;t of the two. What|ever be the
cau&s;e, certain it is, that the females, as Willoughby expre&s;&s;es it, are
of greater &s;ize, more beautiful and lovely for &s;hape and colours,
&s;tronger, more fierce and generous, than the males; whether it may be that it
is nece&s;&s;ary for the female to be thus &s;uperior; as it is incumbent upon
her to provide, not only for her&s;elf, but her young ones al&s;o.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds, like quadrupedes of the car|nivorous kind, are
all lean and meagre. Their fle&s;h is &s;tringy and ill-ta&s;ted, &s;oon
corrupting, and tinctured with the flavour of that animal <PB N="85" REF="99">
food upon which they &s;ub&s;i&s;t. Neverthele&s;s, Belonius a&s;&s;erts, that
many people admire the fle&s;h of the vulture and falcon, and dre&s;s them for
eating, when they meet with any accident that unfits them for the chace. He
a&s;&s;erts, that the O&s;prey, a &s;pecies of the eagle, when young, is
excellent food; but he contents him&s;elf with advi&s;ing us, to breed the&s;e
birds up for our plea&s;ure rather in the field, than for the table.</P>
<P>Of land birds of a rapacious nature, there are five kinds. The
eagle kind, the hawk kind, the vulture kind, the horned, the &s;creech owl
kind. The di&s;tinctive marks of this cla&s;s, are taken from their claws and
beak: their toes are &s;eparated: their legs are feathered to the heel: their
toes are four in number; three before, one behind: their beak is &s;hort, thick
and crooked.</P>
<P>The eagle kind is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t by his beak,
which is &s;traight till towards the end, when it begins to hook downwards.</P>
<P>The vulture kind is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the head and neck: he
is without feathers.</P>
<P>The hawk kind by the beak; being hooked from the very root.</P>
<P>The horned owl by the feathers at the ba&s;e 
<PB N="86" REF="100"> of the bill &s;tanding forwards; and by &s;ome feathers
on the head, that &s;tand out, re&s;embling horns.</P>
<P>The &s;creech owl, by the feathers at the ba&s;e of the bill
&s;tanding forward, and being without horns.&mdash;A de&s;cription of one in

&s;hades in this fierce family; but have all the &s;ame rapacity, the &s;ame
general form, the &s;ame habits, and the &s;ame manner of bringing up their
young.</P>
<P>In general, the&s;e birds are found in moun|tainous and
ill-peopled countries, and breed among the loftie&s;t cliffs. They chu&s;e
tho&s;e places which are remote&s;t from man, upon who&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions
they but &s;eldom make their depredations, being contented rather to follow the
wild game in the fore&s;t than to ri&s;que their &s;afety to &s;atisfy their
hunger.</P>
<P>This fierce animal may be con&s;idered among birds as the lion
among quadrupedes; and in many re&s;pects they have a &s;trong &s;imilitude to
each other. They are both po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of force, and an empire over their
fellows of the fore&s;t. Equally magnanimous, they di&s;dain &s;maller plunder;
and only pur&s;ue animals worthy the conque&s;t. It is not till after having
been long <PB N="89" REF="106"> provoked, by the cries of the rook or the
magpie, that this generous bird thinks fit to puni&s;h them with death: the
eagle al&s;o di&s;dains to &s;hare the plunder of another bird; and will take
up with no other prey but that which he has acquired by his own pur&s;uits. How
hungry &s;oever he may be, he never &s;toops to carrion; and when &s;atiated,
he never returns to the &s;ame carca&s;s, but leaves it for other animals, more
rapacious and le&s;s delicate than he. Solitary, like the lion, he keeps the
de&s;art to him&s;elf alone; it is as extraordinary to &s;ee two pair of eagles
in the &s;ame mountain, as two lions in the &s;ame fore&s;t. They keep
&s;eparate, to find a more ample &s;upply; and con&s;ider the quantity of their
game as the be&s;t proof of their dominion. Nor does the &s;imilitude of
the&s;e animals &s;top here: they have both &s;park|ling eyes, and nearly of
the &s;ame colour; their claws are of the &s;ame form, their breath equally
&s;trong, and their cry equally loud and terrifying. Bred both for war, they
are enemies of all &s;ociety: alike fierce, proud, and incapable of being
ea&s;ily tamed. It requires great patience and much art to tame an eagle; and
even though taken young, and brought under by long a&s;&s;iduity, yet &s;till
it is a dangerous dome&s;tic, and often turns its force again&s;t its ma&s;ter.
When <PB N="90" REF="107"> brought into the field for the purpo&s;es of
fowling, the falconer is never &s;ure of its attachment: that innate pride, and
love of liberty, &s;till prompt it to regain its native &s;olitudes; and the
moment the falconer &s;ees it, when let loo&s;e, fir&s;t &s;toop towards the
ground, and then ri&s;e perpendi|cularly into the clouds, he gives up all his
for|mer labour for lo&s;t; quite &s;ure of never beholding his late pri&s;oner
more. Sometimes, however, they are brought to have an attachment for their
feeder: they are then highly &s;erviceable, and liberally provide for his
plea&s;ures and &s;upport. When the falconer lets them go from his hand, they
play about and hover round him till their game pre&s;ents, which they &s;ee at
an immen&s;e di&s;tance, and pur&s;ue with certain de|&s;truction.</P>
<P>Of all animals the eagle flies highe&s;t; and from thence the
ancients have given him the epithet of <HI>the bird of Heaven.</HI> Of all
others al&s;o, he has the quicke&s;t eye; but his &s;en&s;e of &s;melling is
far inferior to that of the vulture. He never pur&s;ues, therefore, but in
&s;ight; and when he has &s;eized his prey, he &s;toops from his height, as if
to examine its weight, always lay|ing it on the ground before he carries it
off. As his wing is very powerful, yet, as he has but little &s;upplene&s;s in
the joints of the leg, he <PB N="91" REF="108"> finds it difficult to ri&s;e
when down; however, if not in&s;tantly pur&s;ued, he finds no difficulty in
carrying off gee&s;e and cranes. He al&s;o car|ries away hares, lambs, and
kids; and often de&s;troys fawns and calves, to drink their blood, and carries
a part of their fle&s;h to his retreat. Infants them&s;elves, when left
unattended, have been de&s;troyed by the&s;e rapacious creatures; which
probably gave ri&s;e to the fable of Gany|mede's being &s;natched up by an
eagle to heaven.</P>
<P>An in&s;tance is recorded in Scotland of two children being
carried off by eagles; but fortu|nately they received no hurt by the way; and,
the eagles being pur&s;ued, the children were re|&s;tored unhurt out of the
ne&s;ts to the affrighted parents.</P>
<P>The eagle is thus at all times a formidable neighbour; but
peculiarly when bringing up its young. It is then that the female, as well as
the male, exert all their force and in|du&s;try to &s;upply their young. Smith,
in his Hi&s;tory of Kerry, relates, that a poor man in that country got a
comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for his family, during a &s;ummer of famine, out
of an eagle's ne&s;t, by robbing the eaglets of food, which was plentifully
&s;upplied by the old ones. He protracted their a&s;&s;iduity beyond the
u&s;ual <PB N="92" REF="109"> time, by clipping the wings, and retarding the
flight of the young; and very probably al&s;o, as I have known my&s;elf, by
&s;o tying them as to encrea&s;e their cries, which is always found to
encrea&s;e the parent's di&s;patch to procure them provi&s;ion. It was lucky,
however, that the old eagles did not &s;urprize the countryman as he was thus
employed, as their re&s;entment might have been dangerous.</P>
<P>It happened &s;ome time ago, in the &s;ame country, that a
pea&s;ant re&s;olved to rob the ne&s;t of an eagle, that had built in a &s;mall
i&s;land, in the beautiful lake of Killarney. He accord|ingly &s;tripped, and
&s;wam in upon the i&s;land while the old ones were away; and, robbing the
ne&s;t of its young, he was preparing to &s;wim back, with the eaglets tied in
a &s;tring; but, while he was yet up to his chin in the water, the old eagles
returned, and, mi&s;&s;ing their young, quickly fell upon the plunderer, and,
in &s;pite of all his re&s;i&s;tance, di&s;patched him with their beaks and
talons.</P>
<P>In order to extirpate the&s;e pernicious birds, there is a law
in the Orkney I&s;lands which en|titles any per&s;on that kills an eagle to a
hen out of every hou&s;e in the pari&s;h in which the plunderer is killed.</P>
<P>The ne&s;t of the eagle is u&s;ually built in the mo&s;t
inacce&s;&s;ible cliff of the rock, and often <PB N="93" REF="110"> &s;hielded
from the weather by &s;ome jutting crag that hangs over it. Sometimes, however,
it is wholly expo&s;ed to the winds, as well &s;ide|ways as above; for the
ne&s;t is flat, though built with great labour. It is &s;aid that the &s;ame
ne&s;t &s;erves the eagle during life; and indeed the pains be&s;towed in
forming it &s;eems to argue as much. One of the&s;e was found in the Peak of
Derby&s;hire; which Willoughby thus de&s;cribes. 
<Q REND="inline">"It was made of great &s;ticks, re&s;ting one
end on the edge of a rock, the other on two birch-trees. Upon the&s;e was a
layer of ru&s;hes, and over them a layer of heath, and upon the heath ru&s;hes
again; upon which lay one young one, and an addle egg; and by them a lamb, a
hare, and three heath-pouts. The ne&s;t was about two yards &s;quare, and had
no hollow in it. The young eagle was of the &s;hape of a go&s;hawk, of almo&s;t
the weight of a goo&s;e, rough footed, or feathered down to the foot, having a
white ring about the tail."</Q> Such is the place where the female eagle
de|po&s;its her eggs; which &s;eldom exceed two at a time in the larger
&s;pecies, and not above three in the &s;malle&s;t. It is &s;aid that &s;he
hatches them for thirty days: but frequently, even of this &s;mall number of
eggs, a part is addled; and it is extremely rare to find three eaglets in the 
<PB N="94" REF="111"> &s;ame ne&s;t. It is a&s;&s;erted, that as &s;oon as the
young ones are &s;omewhat grown, the mother kills the mo&s;t feeble or the
mo&s;t voracious. If this happens, it mu&s;t proceed only from the
nece&s;&s;ities of the parent, who is incapable of providing for their
&s;upport; and is content to &s;acrifice a part to the welfare of all.</P>
<P>The plumage of the eaglets is not &s;o &s;trongly marked as when
they come to be adult. They are at fir&s;t white; then inclining to yellow; and
at la&s;t of light brown. Age, hunger, long cap|tivity, and di&s;ea&s;es, make
them whiter. It is &s;aid, they live above an hundred years; and that they at
la&s;t die, not of old age, but from the beaks turning inward upon the under
man|dible, and thus preventing their taking any food. They are equally
remarkable, &s;ays Mr. Penant, for their longevity, and for their power of
&s;u&s;taining a long ab&s;ence from food. One of this &s;pecies, which has now
been nine years in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mr. Owen Holland, of Con|way,
lived thirty-two years with the gentleman who made him a pre&s;ent of it; but
what its age was when the latter received it from Ireland, is unknown. The
&s;ame bird al&s;o furni&s;hes a proof of the truth of the other remark; having
once, through the neglect of &s;ervants, endured hunger for twenty-one days,
without any &s;u&s;tenance whatever.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="112">Tho&s;e eagles which are kept tame, are fed
with every kind of fle&s;h, whether fre&s;h or cor|rupting; and when there is a
deficiency of that, bread, or any other provi&s;ion, will &s;uffice. It is very
dangerous approaching them if not quite tame; and they &s;ometimes &s;end forth
a loud piercing lamentable cry, which renders them &s;till more formidable. The
eagle drinks but &s;eldom; and perhaps, when at liberty, not at all, as the
blood of his prey &s;erves to quench his thir&s;t. His excrements are always
&s;oft and moi&s;t, and tinged with that whiti&s;h &s;ub&s;tance which, as was
&s;aid before, mixes in birds with the urine.</P>
<P>Such are the general characteri&s;tics and ha|bitudes of the
eagle; however, in &s;ome the&s;e habitudes differ, as the Sea Eagle and the
O&s;|prey live chiefly upon fi&s;h, and con&s;equently build their ne&s;ts on
the &s;ea-&s;hore, and by the &s;ides of rivers, on the ground among reeds; and
often lay three or four eggs, rather le&s;s than tho&s;e of a hen, of a white
eliptical form. They catch their prey, which is chiefly fi&s;h, by darting down
upon them from above. The Italians compare the violent de&s;cent of the&s;e
birds on their prey, to the fall of lead into water; and call them Aquilla
Piombina, or the Leaden Eagle.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="113">Nor is the Bald Eagle, which is an
inha|bitant of North Carolina, le&s;s remarkable for habits peculiar to
it&s;elf. The&s;e birds breed in that country all the year round. When the
eaglets are ju&s;t covered with down and a &s;ort of white wooly feathers, the
female eagle lays again. The&s;e eggs are left to be hatched by the warmth of
the young ones that continue in the ne&s;t; &s;o that the flight of one brood
makes room for the next, that are but ju&s;t hatched. The&s;e birds fly very
heavily; &s;o that they cannot overtake their prey, like others of the &s;ame
denomination. To remedy this, they often attend a &s;ort of fi&s;hing-hawk,
which they pur&s;ue, and &s;trip the plunderer of its prey. This is the more
remarkable, as this hawk flies &s;wifter than they. The&s;e eagles al&s;o
generally attend upon fowlers in the winter; and when any birds are wounded,
they are &s;ure to be &s;eized by the eagle, though they may fly from the
fowler. This bird will often al&s;o &s;teal young pigs, and carry them alive to
the ne&s;t, which is compo&s;ed of twigs, &s;ticks and rub|bi&s;h: it is large
enough to fill the body of a cart; and is commonly full of bones half eaten,
and putrid fle&s;h, the &s;tench of which is in|tolerable.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. The Condor of America.</HEAD>
<P>WE might now come to &s;peak of the vulture kind, as they hold
the next rank to the eagle; but we are interrupted in our method, by the
con&s;ideration of an enormous bird, who&s;e place is not yet a&s;certained; as
naturali&s;ts are in doubt whether to refer it to the eagle tribe, or to that
of the vulture. Its great &s;trength, force, and vivacity, might plead for its
place among the former; the baldne&s;s of its head and neck might be thought to
degrade it among the latter. In this uncertainty, it will be enough to
de&s;cribe the bird, by the lights we have, and leave fu|ture hi&s;torians to
&s;ettle its rank in the feathered creation. Indeed, if &s;ize and &s;trength,
com|bined with rapidity of flight and rapacity, de|&s;erve pre-eminence, no
bird can be put in com|petition with it.</P>
<P>The Condor po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, in an higher degree than the
eagle, all the qualities that render it formidable, not only to the feathered
kind, but to bea&s;ts, and even to man him&s;elf. Aco&s;ta, Garcila&s;&s;o, and
De&s;marchais, a&s;&s;ert, that it is eighteen feet acro&s;s, the wings
extended. <PB N="101" REF="121"> The beak is &s;o &s;trong as to pierce the
body of a cow; and two of them are able to devour it. They do not even
ab&s;tain from man him&s;elf: but fortunately there are but few of the
&s;pe|cies; for if they had been plenty, every order of animals mu&s;t have
carried on an un&s;uc|ce&s;sful war again&s;t them. The Indians a&s;&s;ert,
that they will carry off a deer, or a young calf, in their talons, as eagles
would an hare or a rabbit; that their &s;ight is piercing, and their air
terrible; that they &s;eldom frequent the fore&s;ts, as they require a large
&s;pace for the di&s;play of their wings; but that they are found on the
&s;ea-&s;hore, and the banks of rivers, whither they de&s;cend from their
heights of the mountains. By later accounts we learn, that they come down to
the &s;ea-&s;hore only at certain &s;ea&s;ons, when their prey happens to fail
them upon land; that they then feed upon dead fi&s;h, and &s;uch other
nutritious &s;ub&s;tances as the &s;ea throws up on the &s;hore. We are
a&s;&s;ured, however, that their countenance is not &s;o terrible as the old
writers have repre&s;ented it; but that they ap|pear of a milder nature than
either the eagle or the vulture.</P>
<P>Condamine has frequently &s;een them in &s;everal parts of the
mountains of Quito, and ob&s;erved them hovering over a flock of &s;heep; and
he <PB N="102" REF="122"> thinks they would, at a certain time, have at|tempted
to carry one off, had they not been &s;cared away by the &s;hepherds. Labat
acquaints us, that tho&s;e who have &s;een this animal, declare that the body
is as large as that of a &s;heep; and that the fle&s;h is tough, and as
di&s;agreeable as carrion. The Spaniards them&s;elves &s;eem to dread its
depredations; and there have been many in&s;tances of its carrying off their
children.</P>
<P>Mr. Strong, the ma&s;ter of a &s;hip, as he was &s;ailing along
the coa&s;ts of Chili, in the thirty-third degree of &s;outh latitude,
ob&s;erved a bird &s;itting upon a high cliff near the &s;hore, which &s;ome of
the &s;hip's company &s;hot with a leaden bullet and killed. They were greatly
&s;urprized when they beheld its magnitude; for when the wings were extended,
they mea&s;ured thirteen feet from one tip to the other. One of the quills was
two feet four inches long; and the barrel, or hollow part, was &s;ix inches and
three quarters, and an inch and an half in circum|ference.</P>
<P>We have a &s;till more circum&s;tantial account of this amazing
bird, by P. Feuill&eacute;e, the only traveller who has accurately de&s;cribed
it: 
<Q REND="inline">"In the valley of Ilo in Peru, I di&s;covered a
con|dor, perched on a high rock before me: I approached within gun-&s;hot and
fired; but, <PB N="103" REF="123"> as my piece was only charged with
&s;wan-&s;hot, the lead was not able &s;ufficiently to pierce the bird's
feathers. I perceived, however, by its manner of flying, that it was wounded;
and it was with a good deal of difficulty that it flew to another rock, about
five hundred yards di&s;tant on the &s;ea-&s;hore. I therefore charged again
with ball, and hit the bird under the throat, which made it mine. I accordingly
ran up to &s;eize it; but, even in death it was terrible, and defended it&s;elf
upon its back, with its claws extended again&s;t me, &s;o that I &s;carce knew
how to lay hold of it. Had it not been mortally wounded, I &s;hould have found
it no ea&s;y matter to take it; but I at la&s;t dragged it down from the rock,
and with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of one of the &s;eamen, I carried it to my tent,
to make a coloured drawing. 
<P> "The wings of this bird, which I mea&s;ured very exactly,
were twelve feet three inches (Engli&s;h) from tip to tip. The great fea|thers,
that were of a beautiful &s;hining black, were two feet four inches long. The
thick|ne&s;s of the beak was proportionable to the re&s;t of the body; the
length about four inches; the point hooked downwards, and white at its
extremity; and the other part <PB N="104" REF="124"> was of a jet black. A
&s;hort down, of a brown colour, covered the head; the eyes were black, and
&s;urrounded with a circle of red|di&s;h brown. The feathers, on the brea&s;t,
neck and wings, were of a light brown; tho&s;e on the back were rather darker.
Its thighs were covered with brown feathers to the knee. The thigh bone was ten
inches long; the leg five inches: the toes were three before, and one behind:
that behind was an inch and an half; and the claw with which it was armed, was
black, and three quarters of an inch. The other claws were in the &s;ame
proportion; and the leg was covered with black &s;cales, as al&s;o the toes;
but in the&s;e the &s;cales were larger.</P> 
<P> "The&s;e birds u&s;ually keep in the mountains, where they
find their prey: they never de&s;cend to the &s;ea-&s;hore, but in the rainy
&s;ea&s;on; for as they are very &s;en&s;ible of cold, they go there for
greater warmth. Though the&s;e moun|tains are &s;ituated in the torrid zone,
the cold is often very &s;evere; for a great part of the year they are covered
with &s;now, but parti|cularly in winter.</P> 
<P> "The little nouri&s;hment which the&s;e birds find on the
&s;ea-coa&s;t, except when the tempe&s;t drives in &s;ome great fi&s;h, obliges
the condor <PB N="105" REF="125"> to continue there but a &s;hort time. They
u&s;ually come to the coa&s;t at the approach of evening; &s;tay there all
night, and fly back in the morning."</P> </Q></P>
<P>It is doubted whether this animal be proper to America only, or
whether it may not have been de&s;cribed by the naturali&s;ts of other
coun|tries. It is &s;uppo&s;ed, that the great bird called the Rock,
de&s;cribed by Arabian writers, and &s;o much exaggerated by fable, is but a
&s;pecies of the condor. The great bird of Tarna&s;&s;ar, in the Ea&s;t Indies,
that is larger than the eagle, as well as the vulture of Senegal, that carries
off children, are probably no other than the bird we have been de&s;cribing.
Ru&s;&s;ia, Lapland, and even Switzerland and Germany, are &s;aid to have known
this animal. A bird of this kind was &s;hot in France, that weighed eighteen
pound, and was &s;aid to be eighteen feet acro&s;s the wings: however, one of
the quills was de|&s;cribed only as being larger than that of a &s;wan; &s;o
that probably the breadth of the wings may have been exaggerated, &s;ince a
bird &s;o large would have the quills more than twice as big as tho&s;e of a
&s;wan. However this be, we are not to regret that it is &s;carcely ever &s;een
in Europe, as it appears to be one of the mo&s;t formidable enemies of mankind.
In the de&s;erts of Pa|chomac, <PB N="106" REF="126"> where it is chiefly
&s;een, men &s;eldom venture to travel. Tho&s;e wild regions are very
&s;ufficient of them&s;elves to in&s;pire a &s;ecret horror: broken
precipices&mdash;prowling panthers&mdash;fore&s;ts only vocal with the
hi&s;&s;ing of &s;erpents&mdash;and mountains rendered &s;till more terrible by
the condor, the only bird that ventures to make its re&s;idence in tho&s;e
de&s;erted &s;ituations.</P>

<P><PB N="107" REF="128"> THE fir&s;t rank in the de&s;cription of
birds, has been given to the eagle; not becau&s;e it is &s;tronger or larger
than the vulture, but becau&s;e it is more generous and bold. The eagle,
unle&s;s pre&s;&s;ed by famine, will not &s;toop to carrion; and never devours
but what he has earned by his own pur&s;uit. The vulture, on the con|trary, is
indelicately voracious; and &s;eldom attacks living animals, when it can be
&s;up|plied with the dead. The eagle meets and &s;ingly oppo&s;es his enemy;
the vulture, if it expects re&s;i&s;tance, calls in the aid of its kind, and
ba&s;ely overpowers its prey by a cowardly combination. Putrefaction and
&s;tench, in&s;tead of deterring, only &s;erves to allure them. The vulture
&s;eems among birds, what the jackall and hyaena are among quadrupedes, who
prey upon carca&s;&s;es, and root up the dead.</P>
<P>Vultures may be ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed from all tho&s;e of
the eagle kind, by the nakedne&s;s of their heads and necks, which are without
fea|thers, and only covered with a very &s;light down, or a few &s;cattered
hairs. Their eyes are more <PB REF="129">

prominent; tho&s;e of the eagle being buried more in the &s;ocket. Their claws
are &s;horter, and le&s;s hooked. The in&s;ide of the wing is covered with a
thick down, which is different in them from all other birds of prey. Their
at|titude is not &s;o upright as that of the eagle; and their flight more
difficult and heavy.</P>
<P>In this tribe we may range the golden, the a&s;h-coloured, and
the brown vulture, which are inhabitants of Europe; the &s;potted, and the
black vulture of Egypt; the bearded vulture; the Bra&s;ilian vulture, and the
king of the vul|tures of South America. They all agree in their nature; being
equally indolent, yet rapacious and unclean.</P>
<P>The Golden Vulture &s;eems to be the fore|mo&s;t of the kind;
and is in many things like the golden eagle, but larger in every proportion.
From the end of the beak, to that of the tail, it is four feet and an half; and
to the claws end, forty-five inches. The length of the upper mandible is
almo&s;t &s;even inches; and the tail twenty-&s;even in length. The lower part
of the neck, brea&s;t and belly, are of a red colour; but on the tail it is
more faint, and deeper near the head. The feathers are black on the back; and
on the wings and tail, of a yellowi&s;h brown. Others of the kind differ from
this in colour and <PB N="109" REF="132"> dimen&s;ions; but they are all
&s;tronly marked by their naked heads, and beak &s;traight in the be|ginning,
but hooking at the point.</P>
<P>They are &s;till more &s;trongly marked by their nature, which,
as has been ob&s;erved, is cruel, unclean, and indolent. Their &s;en&s;e of
&s;melling, however, is amazingly great; and Nature, for this purpo&s;e, has
given them two large apertures or no&s;trils without, and an exten&s;ive
olfactory membrane within. Their inte&s;tines are formed differently from
tho&s;e of the eagle kind; for they partake more of the formation of &s;uch
birds as live upon grain. They have both a crop and a &s;tomach; which may be
regarded as a kind of gizzard, from the extreme thick|ne&s;s of the mu&s;cles
of which it is compo&s;ed. In fact, they &s;eem adapted inwardly, not only for
being carnivorous, but to eat corn, or what&s;oever of that kind comes in their
way.</P>
<P>This bird, which is common in many parts of Europe, and but too
well known on the we&s;tern continent, is totally unknown in Eng|land. In
Egypt, Arabia, and many other king|doms of Africa and A&s;ia, vultures are
found in great abundance. The in&s;ide down of their wing is converted into a
very warm and com|fortable kind of fur, and is commonly &s;old in the A&s;iatic
markets.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="133">Indeed, in Egypt, this bird &s;eems to be
of &s;ingular &s;ervice. There are great flocks of them in the neighbourhood of
Grand Cairo, which no per&s;on is permitted to de&s;troy. The &s;ervice they
render the inhabitants, is the de|vouring all the carrion and filth of that
great city; which might otherwi&s;e tend to corrupt and putrify the air. They
are commonly &s;een in company with the wild dogs of the country, tearing a
carca&s;s very deliberately together. This odd a&s;&s;ociation produces no
quarrels; the birds and quadrupedes &s;eem to live amicably, and nothing but
harmony &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between them. The wonder is &s;till the greater, as both
are extremely rapacious, and both lean and bony to a very great degree;
probably having no great plenty even of the wretched food on which they
&s;ub&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>In America, they lead a life &s;omewhat &s;imilar. Wherever the
hunters, who there only pur&s;ue bea&s;ts for the &s;kins, are found to go,
the&s;e birds are &s;een to pur&s;ue them. They &s;till keep hovering at a
little di&s;tance; and when they &s;ee the bea&s;t flead and abandoned, they
call out to each other, pour down upon the carca&s;s, and, in an in&s;tant,
pick its bones as bare and clean as if they had been &s;craped by a knife.</P>
<P>At the Cape of Good Hope, in Africa, they <PB N="111" REF="134">
&s;eem to di&s;cover a &s;till greater &s;hare of dexterity in their methods of
carving. 
<Q REND="inline">"I have," &s;ays Kolben, "been often a
&s;pectator of the man|ner in which they have anatomized a dead body: I &s;ay
anatomized, for no arti&s;t in the world could have done it more cleanly. They
have a wonderful method of &s;eparating the fle&s;h from the bones, and yet
leaving the &s;kin quite entire. Upon coming near the carca&s;s, one would not
&s;uppo&s;e it thus deprived of its internal &s;ub&s;tance, till he began to
examine it more clo&s;ely; he then finds it, literally &s;peaking, nothing but
&s;kin and bone. Their manner of performing the operation, is this: they
fir&s;t make an opening in the belly of the animal, from whence they pluck out
and greedily devour the entrails; then entering into the hollow which they have
made, they &s;eparate the fle&s;h from the bones, without ever touching the
&s;kin. It often happens that an ox returning home alone to its &s;tall from
the plow, lies down by the way: it is then, if the vultures perceive it, that
they fall with fury down, and inevitably devour the unfortunate animal. They
&s;ometimes attempt them grazing in the fields; and then, to the number of a
hundred, or more, make their attack all at once and together."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="135"> 
<Q REND="inline">"They are attracted by carrion," &s;ays
Cate&s;by, "from a very great di&s;tance. It is plea&s;ant to behold them, when
they are thus eating, and di&s;puting for their prey. An eagle generally
pre&s;ides at the&s;e enter|tainments, and makes them all keep their di&s;tance
till he has done. They then fall too with an excellent appetite: and their
&s;en&s;e of &s;melling is &s;o exqui&s;ite, that the in&s;tant a carca&s;s
drops, we may &s;ee the vultures floating in the air from all quarters, and
come &s;ou&s;ing on their prey."</Q> It is &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome, that they
eat nothing that has life; but this is only when they are not able: for when
they can come at lambs, they &s;hew no mercy; and &s;erpents are their ordinary
food. The manner of tho&s;e birds is to perch them|&s;elves, &s;everal
together, on the old pine and cypre&s;s-trees; where they continue all the
morning, for &s;everal hours, with their wings unfolded: nor are they fearful
of danger, but &s;uffer people to approach them very near, par|ticularly when
they are eating.</P>
<P>The &s;loth, the filth, and the voraciou&s;ne&s;s of the&s;e
birds, almo&s;t exceed credibility. In the Brazils, where they are found in
great abun|dance, when they light upon a carca&s;s, which they have liberty to
tear at their ea&s;e, they &s;o <PB N="113" REF="136"> gorge them&s;elves, that
they are unable to fly; but keep hopping along when they are pur&s;ued. At all
times, they are a bird of &s;low flight, and unable readily to rai&s;e
them&s;elves from the ground; but when they have over-fed, they are then
utterly helple&s;s: but they &s;oon get rid of their burthen; for they have a
me|thod of vomiting up what they have eaten, and then they fly off with greater
facility.</P>
<P>It is plea&s;ant, however, to be a &s;pectator of the
ho&s;tilities between animals that are thus hateful or noxious. Of all
creatures, the two mo&s;t at enmity, is the vulture of Brazil, and the
crocodile. The female of this terrible am|phibious creature, which in the
rivers of that part of the world grows to the &s;ize of twenty-&s;even feet,
lays it eggs, to the number of one or two hundred, in the &s;ands, on the
&s;ide of the river, where they are hatched by the heat of the climate. For
this purpo&s;e, &s;he takes every precaution to hide from all other animals the
place where &s;he depo&s;es her burthen: in the mean time, a number of
vultures, or galina&s;&s;os, as the Spaniards call them, &s;it, &s;ilent and
un|&s;een, in the branches of &s;ome neighbouring fore&s;t, and view the
crocodile's operations, with the plea&s;ing expectations of &s;ucceeding
plunder. They patiently wait till the crocodile <PB N="114" REF="137"> has laid
the whole number of her eggs, till &s;he has covered them carefully under the
&s;and, and until &s;he is retired from them to a convenient di&s;tance. Then,
all together, encouraging each other with cries, they pour down upon the
ne&s;t, hook up the &s;and in a moment, lay the eggs bare, and devour the whole
brood without remor&s;e. Wretched as is the fle&s;h of the&s;e animals, yet
men, perhaps when pre&s;&s;ed by hunger, have been tempted to ta&s;te it.
No|thing can be more lean, &s;tringy, nau&s;eous, and un&s;avory. It is in vain
that, when killed, the rump has been cut off; in vain the body has been
wa&s;hed, and &s;pices u&s;ed to overpower its prevailing odour; it &s;till
&s;mells and ta&s;tes of the carrion by which it was nouri&s;hed, and &s;ends
forth a &s;tench that is in&s;upportable.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds, at lea&s;t tho&s;e of Europe, u&s;ually lay two
eggs at a time, and produce but once a year. They make their ne&s;ts in
inacce&s;&s;ible cliffs, and in places &s;o remote that it is rare to find
them. Tho&s;e in our part of the world, chiefly re&s;ide in the places where
they breed, and &s;eldom come down into the plains, except when the &s;now and
ice, in their native retreats, has bani&s;hed all living animals but
them&s;elves: they then come from their heights, and brave the perils they
mu&s;t encounter in a more cultivated <PB N="115" REF="138"> region. As carrion
is not found, at tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons, in &s;ufficient quantity, or
&s;ufficiently remote from man to &s;u&s;tain them, they prey upon rabbits,
hares, &s;erpents, and whatever &s;mall game they can overtake or
overpower.</P>
<P>Such are the manners of this bird in general; but there is one
of the kind, called the King of the Vultures, which, from its extraordinary
figure, de&s;erves a &s;eparate de&s;cription. This bird is a native of
America, and not of the Ea&s;t Indies, as tho&s;e who make a trade of &s;hewing
birds would induce us to believe. This bird is larger than a turkey-cock; but
is cheifly remarkable for the odd formation of the &s;kin of the head and neck,
which is bare. This &s;kin ari&s;es from the ba&s;e of the bill, and is of an
orange colour; from whence it &s;tretches on each &s;ide to the head: from
thence it pro|ceeds, like an indented comb, and falls on either &s;ide,
according to the motion of the head. The eyes are &s;urrounded by a red &s;kin,
of a &s;carlet colour; and the iris has the colour and lu&s;tre of pearl. The
head and neck are without feathers, covered with a fle&s;h-coloured &s;kin on
the upper part, a fine &s;carlet behind the head, and a du&s;kier coloured
&s;kin before: farther down behind the head, ari&s;es a little tuft of black
down, from whence i&s;&s;ues and extends beneath <PB N="116" REF="139"> the
throat, on each &s;ide, a wrinkled &s;kin, of a browni&s;h colour, mixed with
blue, and red|di&s;h behind: below, upon the naked part of the neck, is a
collar, formed by &s;oft longi&s;h feathers, of a deep a&s;h colour, which
&s;urround the neck, and cover the brea&s;t before. Into this collar the bird
&s;ometimes withdraws its whole neck, and &s;ometimes a part of its head; &s;o
that it looks as if it had withdrawn the neck into the body. Tho&s;e marks are
&s;ufficient to di&s;tingui&s;h this bird from all others of the vulture kind;
and it cannot be doubted, but that it is the mo&s;t beautiful of all this
deformed family: however, neither its habits nor in&s;tincts vary from the
re&s;t of the tribe; being, like them, a &s;low cowardly bird, living chiefly
upon rats, lizards, and &s;erpents; and upon carrion or excrement, when it
happens in the way. The fle&s;h is &s;o bad, that even &s;avages them&s;elves
cannot abide it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. Of the Falcon Kind and its Affinities.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY creature becomes more important in the hi&s;tory of nature
in proportion as it is con|nected with man. In this view, the &s;malle&s;t
ve|getable, or the mo&s;t &s;eemingly contemptible in&s;ect, is a &s;ubject
more de&s;erving attention than the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing tree or the mo&s;t
beau|tiful of the feathered creation. In this view, the falcon is a more
important animal than the eagle or the vulture; and, though &s;o very
di|minutive in the compari&s;on, is notwith&s;tanding, from its connexion with
our plea&s;ures, a much more intere&s;ting object of curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>The amu&s;ement of hawking, indeed, is now pretty much given
over in this kingdom; for, as every country refines, as its enclo&s;ures become
higher and clo&s;er, tho&s;e rural &s;ports mu&s;t con&s;e|quently decline, in
which the game is to be pur&s;ued over a long extent of country, and where,
while every thing retards the pur&s;uer below, nothing can &s;top the object of
his pur|&s;uit above.</P>
<P>Falconry, that is now &s;o much di&s;u&s;ed among us, was the
principal amu&s;ement of our <PB N="118" REF="141"> ance&s;tors. A per&s;on of
rank &s;carce &s;tirred out without his hawk on his hand; which in old
paintings is the criterion of nobility. Harold, afterwards king of England,
when he went on a mo&s;t important emba&s;&s;y into Normandy, is drawn in an
old bas-relief, as embarking with a bird on his fi&s;t and a dog under his arm.
In tho&s;e days, it was thought &s;ufficient for noble|men's &s;ons to wind the
horn, and to carry their hawk fair, and leave &s;tudy and learning to the
children of meaner people. Indeed, this diver&s;ion was in &s;uch high e&s;teem
among the great all over Europe, that Frederic, one of the em|perors of
Germany, thought it not beneath him to write a treati&s;e upon hawking.</P>
<P>The expence which attended this &s;port was very great: among
the old Welch princes, the king's falconer was the fourth officer in the
&s;tate; but, notwith&s;tanding all his honours, he was forbid to take more
than three draughts of beer from his horn, le&s;t he &s;hould get drunk and
neglect his duty. In the reign of James the Fir&s;t, Sir Thomas Mon&s;on is
&s;aid to have given a thou&s;and pounds for a ca&s;t of hawks; and &s;uch was
their value in general, that it was made felony in the reign of Edward the
Third to &s;teal a hawk. To take its eggs, even in a per&s;on's own ground, was
puni&s;hable with im|pri&s;onment <PB N="119" REF="142"> for a year and a day,
together with a fine at the king's plea&s;ure. In the reign of Elizabeth, the
impri&s;onment was reduced to three months; but the offender was to lie in
pri&s;on till he got &s;ecurity for his good behaviour for &s;even years
farther. In the earlier times, the art of gunning was but little practi&s;ed,
and the hawk then was valuable, not only for its affording diver&s;ion, but for
its procuring de|licacies for the table that could &s;eldom be ob|tained any
other way.</P>
<P>Of many of the ancient falcons u&s;ed for this purpo&s;e, we at
this time know only the names, as the exact &s;pecies are &s;o ill de&s;cribed,
that one may be very ea&s;ily mi&s;taken for another. Of tho&s;e in u&s;e at
pre&s;ent, both here and in other countries, are the gyr-falcon, the falcon,
the lanner, the &s;acre, the hobby, the ke&s;tril, and the merlin. The&s;e are
called the long|winged hawks, to di&s;tingui&s;h them from the go&s;s-hawk, the
&s;parrow hawk, the kite, and the buzzard, that are of &s;horter wing, and
either too &s;low, too cowardly, too indolent, or too ob&s;tinate, to be
&s;erviceable in contributing to the plea&s;ures of the field.</P>
<P>The generous tribe of hawks, as was &s;aid, are
di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t by the peculiar length of their wings, which
reach nearly as low <PB N="120" REF="143"> as the tail. In the&s;e, the fir&s;t
quill of the wing is nearly as long as the &s;econd; it terminates in a point
which begins to dimini&s;h from about an inch of its extremity. This
&s;ufficiently di&s;tin|gui&s;hes the generous breed from that of the ba&s;er
race of kites, &s;parrow-hawks, and buz|zards, in whom the tail is longer than
the wings, and the fir&s;t feather of the wing is rounded at the extremity.
They differ al&s;o in the latter having the fourth feather of the wing the
longe&s;t; in the generous race it is al|ways the &s;econd.</P>
<P>This generous race, which have been taken into the &s;ervice of
man, are endowed with na|tural powers that the other kinds are not
po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of. From the length of their wings, they are &s;wifter to
pur&s;ue their game; from a confidence in this &s;wiftne&s;s, they are bolder
to attack it; and, from an innate genero&s;ity, they have an attachment to
their feeder, and con&s;e|quently a docility which the ba&s;er birds are
&s;trangers to.</P>
<P>The gyr-falcon leads in this bold train. He exceeds all other
falcons in the largene&s;s of his &s;ize, for he approaches nearly to the
mag|nitude of the eagle. The top of the head is flat and of an a&s;h colour,
with a &s;trong, thick, &s;hort, and blue beak. The feathers of the back 
<PB N="121" REF="144"> and wings are marked with black &s;pots, in the &s;hape
of an heart; he is a courageous and fierce bird, nor fears even the eagle
him&s;elf; but he chiefly flies at the &s;tork, the heron, and the crane. He is
mo&s;tly found in the colder re|gions of the north, but lo&s;es neither his
&s;trength nor his courage when brought into the milder climates.</P>
<P>The falcon, properly &s;o called, is the &s;econd in magnitude
and fame. There are &s;ome va|rieties in this bird; but there &s;eem to be only
two that claim di&s;tinction; the falcon gentil and the peregrine faulcon; both
are much le&s;s than the gyr, and &s;omewhat about the &s;ize of a raven. They
differ but &s;lightly, and perhaps only from the different &s;tates they were
in when brought into captivity. Tho&s;e differences are ea&s;ier known by
experience than taught by de|&s;cription. The falcon gentil moults in March,
and often &s;ooner; the peregrine falcon does not moult till the middle of
Augu&s;t. The pe|regrine is &s;tronger in the &s;houlder, has a larger eye, and
yet more &s;unk in the head; his beak is &s;tronger, his legs longer, and the
toes better divided.</P>
<P>Next in &s;ize to the&s;e is the lanner, a bird now very little
known in Europe; then follows the &s;acre, the legs of which are of a 
<PB N="122" REF="145"> blui&s;h colour, and &s;erve to di&s;tingui&s;h that
bird; to them &s;ucceeds the hobby, u&s;ed for &s;maller game, for daring
larks, and &s;tooping at quails. The ke&s;tril was trained for the &s;ame
purpo&s;es; and la&s;tly the merlin; which though the &s;malle&s;t of all the
hawk or falcon kind, and not much larger than a thru&s;h, yet di&s;plays a
degree of courage that renders him formidable even to birds ten times his
&s;ize. He has often been known to kill a partridge or a quail at a &s;ingle
pounce from above.</P>
<P>Some of the other &s;pecies of &s;luggi&s;h birds were now and
then trained to this &s;port, but it was when no better could be obtained; but
the&s;e ju&s;t de&s;cribed were only con&s;idered as birds of the nobler races.
Their courage in general was &s;uch, that no bird, not very much above their
own &s;ize, could terrify them; their &s;wiftne&s;s &s;o great, that &s;carce
any bird could e&s;cape them; and their docility &s;o remarkable, that they
obeyed not only the commands, but the &s;igns of their ma&s;ter. They remained
quietly perched upon his hand till their game was flu&s;hed, or el&s;e kept
hovering round his head, without ever leaving him but when he gave
permi&s;&s;ion. The common falcon is a bird of &s;uch &s;pirit, that, like a
conqueror in a country, he keeps all birds in awe and in &s;ub|jection 
<PB N="123" REF="146"> to his prow&s;e. Where he is &s;een flying wild, as I
often had an opportunity of ob&s;erv|ing, the birds of every kind, that
&s;eemed en|tirely to di&s;regard the kite or the &s;parrow-hawk, fly with
&s;creams at his mo&s;t di&s;tant appearance. Long before I could &s;ee the
falcon, I have &s;een them with the utmo&s;t &s;igns of terror en|deavouring to
avoid him; and, like the pea|&s;ants of a country before a victorious army,
every one of them attempting to &s;hift for him|&s;elf. Even the young falcons,
though their &s;pirit be depre&s;&s;ed by captivity, will, when brought out
into the field, venture to fly at barnacles and wild gee&s;e, till, being
&s;oundly bru&s;hed and beaten by tho&s;e &s;trong birds, they learn their
error, and de&s;i&s;t from meddling with &s;uch unwieldy game for the
future.</P>
<P>To train up the hawk to this kind of obe|dience, &s;o as to hunt
for his ma&s;ter, and bring him the game he &s;hall kill, requires no &s;mall
degree of &s;kill and a&s;&s;iduity. Numberle&s;s trea|ti&s;es have been
written upon this &s;ubject, which are now, with the &s;port it&s;elf, almo&s;t
utterly for|gotten: indeed, except to a few, they &s;eem utterly
unintelligible; for the falconers had a language peculiar to them&s;elves, in
which they conver&s;ed and wrote, and took a kind of profe&s;&s;ional pride in
u&s;ing no other. A modern reader, I &s;uppo&s;e, would be little edified by
one of the <PB N="124" REF="147"> in&s;tructions, for in&s;tance, which we find
in Willoughby, when he bids us 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>draw our falcon out of the mew twenty days
before we en&s;eam her. If &s;he tru&s;s and carry, the remedy is, to co&s;&s;e
her talons, her pow&s;e, and petty &s;ingle.</HI></Q></P>
<P>But, as it certainly makes a part of natural hi&s;tory to &s;hew
how much the nature of birds can be wrought upon by har&s;h or kind treat|ment,
I will ju&s;t take leave to give a &s;hort ac|count of the manner of training
an hawk, di|ve&s;ted of tho&s;e cant words with which men of art have thought
proper to ob&s;cure their pro|fe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In order to train up a falcon, the ma&s;ter begins by clapping
on &s;traps upon his legs, which are called je&s;&s;es, to which there is
fa&s;tened a ring with the owner's name, by which, in ca&s;e he &s;hould be
lo&s;t, the finder may know where to bring him back. To the&s;e al&s;o are
added little bells, which &s;erve to mark the place where he is, if lo&s;t in
the chace. He is always carried on the fi&s;t, and is obliged to keep without
&s;leeping. If he be &s;tubborn, and attempts to bite, his head is plunged into
water. Thus, by hunger, watch|ing, and fatigue, he is con&s;trained to &s;ubmit
to having his head covered by a hood or cowl, which covers his eyes. This
trouble&s;ome em|ployment continues often for three days and 
<PB N="125" REF="148"> nights without cea&s;ing. It rarely happens but at the
end of this his nece&s;&s;ities, and the pri|vation of light, make him lo&s;e
all idea of li|berty, and bring down his natural wildne&s;s. His ma&s;ter
judges of his being tamed when he permits his head to be covered without
re&s;i&s;t|ance, and when uncovered he &s;eizes the meat before him
contentedly. The repetition of the&s;e le&s;&s;ons by degrees en&s;ures
&s;ucce&s;s. His wants being the chief principle of his depend|ance, it is
endeavoured to encrea&s;e his appetite by giving him little balls of flannel,
which he greedily &s;wallows. Having thus excited the appetite, care is taken
to &s;atisfy it; and thus gratitude attaches the bird to the man who but ju&s;t
before had been his tormentor.</P>
<P>When the fir&s;t le&s;&s;ons have &s;ucceeded, and the bird
&s;hews &s;igns of docility, he is carried out upon &s;ome green, the head is
uncovered, and, by flattering him with food at different times, he is taught to
jump on the fi&s;t, and to continue there. When confirmed in this habit, it is
then thought time to make him acquainted with the lure. This lure is only a
thing &s;tuffed like the bird the falcon is de&s;igned to pur&s;ue, &s;uch as
an heron, a pidgeon, or a quail, and on this lure they always take care to give
him his food. It is quite nece&s;&s;ary that the bird &s;hould 
<PB N="126" REF="149"> not only be acquainted with this but fond of it, and
delicate in his food when &s;hewn it. When the falcon has flown upon this, and
ta&s;ted the fir&s;t mor&s;el, &s;ome falconers then take it away; but by this
there is a danger of daunting the bird; and the &s;ure&s;t method is, when he
flies to &s;eize it to let him feed at large, and this &s;erves as a recompence
for his docility. The u&s;e of this lure is to flatter him back when he has
flown in the air, which it &s;ometimes fails to do; and it is always
requi&s;ite to a&s;&s;i&s;t it by the voice and the &s;igns of the ma&s;ter.
When the&s;e le&s;&s;ons have been long repeated, it is then nece&s;&s;ary to
&s;tudy the character of the bird; to &s;peak fre|quently to him if he be
inattentive to the voice; to &s;tint in his food &s;uch as do not come kindly
or readily to the lure; to keep waking him if he be not &s;ufficiently
familiar; and to cover him frequently with the hood if he fears darkne&s;s.
When the familiarity and the docility of the bird are &s;ufficiently confirmed
on the green, he is then carried into the open fields, but &s;till kept fa&s;t
by a &s;tring which is about twenty yards long. He is then uncovered as before;
and the falconer, calling him at &s;ome paces di&s;tance, &s;hews him the lure.
When he flies upon it he is permitted to take a large mor&s;el of the food
which is tied to it. The next day the lure is &s;hewn him at 
<PB N="127" REF="150"> a greater di&s;tance, till he comes at la&s;t to fly to
it at the utmo&s;t length of his &s;tring. He is then to be &s;hewn the game
it&s;elf alive, but di&s;|abled or tame, which he is de&s;igned to pur&s;ue.
After having &s;eized this &s;everal times with his &s;tring, he is then left
entirely at liberty, and carried into the field for the purpo&s;es of
pur|&s;uing that which is wild. At that he flies with avidity; and when he has
&s;eized it, or killed it, he is brought back by the voice and the lure.</P>
<P>By this method of in&s;truction, an hawk may be taught to fly at
any game what&s;oever; but falconers have chiefly confined their pur&s;uit only
to &s;uch animals as yield them profit by the capture or plea&s;ure in the
pur&s;uit. The hare, the partridge, and the quail, repay the trouble of taking
them; but the mo&s;t delightful &s;port is the falcon's pur&s;uit of the heron,
the kite, or the wood-lark. In&s;tead of flying di|rectly forward, as &s;ome
other birds do, the&s;e, when they &s;ee them&s;elves threatened by the
ap|proach of the hawk, immediately take to the &s;kies. They fly almo&s;t
perpendicularly up|ward, while their ardent pur&s;uer keeps pace with their
flight, and tries to ri&s;e above them. Thus both dimini&s;h by degrees from
the gazing &s;pectator below, till they are quite lo&s;t in the clouds; but
they are &s;oon &s;een de&s;cending, <PB N="128" REF="151"> &s;truggling
together, and u&s;ing every effort on both &s;ides; the one of rapacious
in&s;ult, the other of de&s;perate defence. The unequal combat is &s;oon at an
end; the falcon comes off victorious, and the other, killed or di&s;abled, is
made a prey either to the bird or the &s;port&s;man.</P>
<P>As for other birds, they are not &s;o much pur|&s;ued, as they
generally fly &s;traight forward, by which the &s;port&s;man lo&s;es &s;ight of
the chace, and, what is &s;till wor&s;e, runs a chance of lo&s;ing his falcon
al&s;o. The pur&s;uit of the lark by a couple of merlins is con&s;idered, to
him only who regards the &s;agacity of the chace, as one of the mo&s;t
delightful &s;pectacles this exerci&s;e can afford. The amu&s;ement is, to
&s;ee one of the merlins climbing to get the a&s;cendant of the lark, while the
other, lying low for the be&s;t advantage, waits the &s;ucce&s;s of its
companion's efforts; thus while the one &s;toops to &s;trike its prey, the
other &s;eizes it at its coming down.</P>
<P>Such is the natural and acquired habits of the&s;e birds, which
of all others have the greate&s;t &s;trength and courage relative to their
&s;ize. While the kite or the go&s;s-hawk approach their prey &s;ide-ways,
the&s;e dart perpendicularly, in their wild &s;tate, upon their game, and
devour it on the &s;pot, or carry it off, if not too large for their power of
flying. They are &s;ometimes <PB N="129" REF="152"> &s;een de&s;cending
perpendicularly from the clouds, from an amazing height, and darting down on
their prey with inevitable &s;wiftne&s;s and de|&s;truction.</P>
<P>The more ignoble race of birds make up by cunning and
a&s;&s;iduity what the&s;e claim by force and celerity. Being le&s;s
courageous, they are more patient; and, having le&s;s &s;wiftne&s;s, they are
better &s;killed at taking their prey by &s;ur|prize. The kite, that may be
di&s;tingui&s;hed from all the re&s;t of this tribe by his forky tail and his
&s;low floating motion, &s;eems almo&s;t for|ever upon the wing. He appears to
re&s;t him|&s;elf upon the bo&s;om of the air, and not to make the &s;malle&s;t
effort in flying. He lives only upon accidental carnage, as almo&s;t every bird
in the air is able to make good its retreat again&s;t him. He may be therefore
con&s;idered as an in&s;iduous thief who only prowls about and, when he finds a
&s;mall bird wounded, or a young chicken &s;trayed too far from the mother,
in&s;tantly &s;eizes the hour of calamity, and, like a fami&s;hed glutton, is
&s;ure to &s;hew no mercy. His hunger, indeed, often urges him to acts of
&s;eeming de&s;peration. I have &s;een one of them fly round and round for a
while to mark a clutch of chickens, and then on a &s;udden dart like lightning
upon the unre&s;i&s;ting little <PB N="130" REF="153"> animal, and carry it
off, the hen in vain crying out, and the boys hooting and ca&s;ting &s;tones to
&s;care it from its plunder. For this rea&s;on, of all birds the kite is the
good hou&s;ewife's greate&s;t tormentor and aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>Of all ob&s;cene birds, the kite is the be&s;t known; but the
buzzard among us is the mo&s;t plenty. He is a &s;luggi&s;h inactive bird, and
often remains perched whole days together upon the &s;ame bough. He is rather
an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in than a pur&s;uer; and lives more upon frogs, mice, and
in&s;ects, which he can ea&s;ily &s;eize, than upon birds which he is obliged
to follow. He lives in &s;ummer by robbing the ne&s;ts of other birds, and
&s;ucking their eggs, and more re|&s;embles the owl kind in his countenance
than any other rapacious bird of day. His figure implies the &s;tupidity of his
di&s;po&s;ition; and &s;o little is he capable of in&s;truction from man, that
it is common to a proverb to call one who cannot be taught, or continues
ob&s;tinately ig|norant, a buzzard. The honey-buzzard, the moor-buzzard, and
the hen-harrier, are all of this &s;tupid tribe, and differ chiefly in their
&s;ize, growing le&s;s in the order I have named them. The go&s;s-hawk and
&s;parrow hawk are what Mr. Willoughby calls &s;hort winged birds, and
con|&s;equently unfit for training, however injurious <PB N="131" REF="154">
they may be to the pidgeon-hou&s;e or the &s;port&s;|man. They have been indeed
taught to fly at game; but little is to be obtained from their efforts, being
difficult of in&s;truction and capri|cious in their obedience. It has been
lately a&s;|&s;erted, however, by one who&s;e authority is re|&s;pectable, that
the &s;parrow-hawk is the bolde&s;t and the be&s;t of all others for the
plea&s;ure of the chace.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. The Butcher-Bird.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE I conclude this &s;hort hi&s;tory of ra|pacious birds
that prey by day, I mu&s;t take leave to de&s;cribe a tribe of &s;maller birds,
that &s;eem from their &s;ize rather to be cla&s;&s;ed with the harmle&s;s
order of the &s;parrow-kind; but that from their crooked beak, courage, and
appetites for &s;laughter, certainly de&s;erve a place here. The le&s;&s;er
butcher-bird is not much above the &s;ize of a lark; that of the &s;malle&s;t
&s;pecies is not &s;o big as a &s;parrow; yet, diminutive as the&s;e little
animals are, they make them&s;elves for|midable to birds of four times their
dimen&s;ions.</P>
<P>The greater butcher bird is about as large as a thru&s;h; its
bill is black, an inch long, and hooked at the end. This mark, together with
its carnivorous appetites, ranks it among the rapacious birds; at the &s;ame
time that its legs and feet, which are &s;lender, and its toes, formed
&s;omewhat differently from the former, would &s;eem to make it the &s;hade
between &s;uch birds as live wholly upon fle&s;h, and &s;uch as live chiefly
upon in&s;ects and grain.</P>
<P>Indeed, its habits &s;eem entirely to corre&s;pond 
<PB N="133" REF="156"> with its conformation, as it is found to live as well
upon fle&s;h as upon in&s;ects, and thus to partake in &s;ome mea&s;ure of a
double nature. However, its appetite for fle&s;h is the mo&s;t pre|valent; and
it never takes up with the former when it can obtain the latter. This bird,
there|fore, leads a life of continual combat and op|po&s;ition. As from its
&s;ize it does not much terrify the &s;maller birds of the fore&s;t, &s;o it
very frequently meets birds willing to try its &s;trength, and it never
declines the engagement.</P>
<P>It is wonderful to &s;ee with what intrepidity this little
creature goes to war with the pie, the crow, and the ke&s;tril, all above four
times bigger than it&s;elf, and that &s;ometimes prey upon fle&s;h in the
&s;ame manner. It not only fights upon the defen&s;ive, but often comes to the
attack, and always with advantage, particularly when the male and female unite
to protect their young, and to drive away the more powerful birds of rapine. At
that &s;ea&s;on, they do not wait the approach of their invader; it is
&s;uf|ficient that they &s;ee him preparing for the a&s;|&s;ault at a
di&s;tance. It is then that they &s;ally forth with loud cries, wound him on
every &s;ide, and drive him off with &s;uch fury, that he &s;eldom ventures to
return to the charge. In the&s;e kinds of di&s;putes, they generally come off
with <PB N="134" REF="157"> the victory; though it &s;ometimes happens that
they fall to the ground with the bird they have &s;o fiercely fixed upon, and
the combat ends with the de&s;truction of the a&s;&s;ailant as well as the
defender.</P>
<P>For this rea&s;on, the mo&s;t redoubtable birds of prey
re&s;pect them; while the kite, the buz|zard, and the crow, &s;eems rather to
fear than &s;eek the engagement. Nothing in nature better di&s;plays the
re&s;pect paid to the claims of cou|rage, than to &s;ee this little bird,
apparently &s;o contemptible, fly in company with the lanner, the falcon, and
all the tyrants of the air, with|out fearing their power, or avoiding their
re|&s;entment.</P>
<P>As for &s;mall birds, they are its u&s;ual food. It &s;eizes
them by the throat, and &s;trangles them in an in&s;tant. When it has thus
killed the bird or in&s;ect, it is a&s;&s;erted by the be&s;t authority, that
it fixes them upon &s;ome neighbouring thorn, and, when thus &s;pitted, pulls
them to pieces with its bill. It is &s;uppo&s;ed that as Na|ture has not given
this bird &s;trength &s;ufficient to tear its prey to pieces with its feet, as
the hawks do, it is obliged to have recour&s;e to this extraordinary
expedient.</P>
<P>During &s;ummer, &s;uch of them as con&s;tantly re&s;ide here,
for the &s;maller red butcher-bird migrates, remain among the mountainous parts
<PB N="135" REF="158"> of the country; but in winter they de&s;cend into the
plains and nearer human habitations. The larger kind make their ne&s;ts on the
highe&s;t trees, while the le&s;&s;er build in bu&s;hes in the fields and
hedge-rows. They both lay about &s;ix eggs, of a white colour, but encircled at
the bigger end with a ring of browni&s;h red. The ne&s;t on the out&s;ide is
compo&s;ed of white mo&s;s, interwoven with long gra&s;s; within, it is well
lined with wool, and is u&s;ually fixed among the forking branches of a tree.
The female feeds her young with caterpillars and other in&s;ects while very
young; but &s;oon after accu&s;toms them to fle&s;h, which the male procures
with &s;urprizing indu&s;try. Their nature al&s;o is very different from other
birds of prey in their parental care; for, &s;o far from driving out their
young from the ne&s;t to &s;hift for them&s;elves, they keep them with care;
and even when adult they do not for&s;ake them, but the whole brood live in one
family together. Each family lives apart, and is generally com|po&s;ed of the
male, female, and five or &s;ix young ones; the&s;e all maintain peace and
&s;ubordina|tion among each other, and hunt in concert. Upon the returning
&s;ea&s;on of court&s;hip this union is at an end, the family parts for ever,
each to e&s;tabli&s;h a little hou&s;ehold of its own. It is ea&s;y to
di&s;tingui&s;h the&s;e birds at a di&s;tance, <PB N="136" REF="159"> not only
from their going in companies, but al&s;o from their manner of flying, which is
always up and down, &s;eldom direct or &s;ide-ways.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e birds there are three or four different kinds; but
the greater a&s;h-coloured butcher-bird is the lea&s;t known among us. The red
backed butcher-bird migrates in autumn, and does not return till &s;pring. The
woodchat re|&s;embles the former except in the colour of the back, which is
brown and not red as in the other. There is &s;till another, le&s;s than either
of the former, found in the mar&s;hes near London. This too is a bird of prey,
although not much bigger than a tit-mou&s;e; an evident proof that an animal's
courage or rapacity does not depend upon its &s;ize. Of foreign birds of this
kind there are &s;everal; but as we know little of their manner of living, we
will not, in&s;tead of hi|&s;tory, &s;ub&s;titute mere de&s;cription. In fact,
the colours of a bird, which is all we know of them, would afford a reader but
&s;mall entertainment in the enumeration. Nothing can be more ea&s;y than to
fill volumes with the different &s;hades of a bird's plumage; but the&s;e
accounts are written with more plea&s;ure than they are read; and a &s;ingle
glance of a good plate or a picture imprints a ju&s;ter idea than a volume
could convey.</P>

<PB N="137" REF="160">
<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. Of Rapacious Birds of the Owl Kind that prey by
Night.</HEAD>
<P>HITHERTO we have been de&s;cribing a tribe of animals who,
though plunderers among their fellows of the air, yet wage war boldly in the
face of day. We now come to a race equally cruel and rapacious; but who add to
their &s;avage di&s;po&s;ition, the further reproach of treachery, and carry on
all their depredations by night.</P>
<P>All birds of the owl kind may be con&s;idered as nocturnal
robbers, who, unfitted for taking their prey while it is light, &s;urprize it
at tho&s;e hours of re&s;t when the tribes of Nature are in the lea&s;t
expectation of an enemy. Thus there &s;eems no link in Nature's chain broken;
no where a dead inactive repo&s;e; but every place, every &s;ea&s;on, every
hour of the day and night, is bu&s;tling with life, and furni&s;hing
in&s;tances of indu&s;try, &s;elf-defence, and inva&s;ion.</P>
<P>All birds of the owl kind have one common mark, by which they
are di&s;tingui&s;hed from others; their eyes are formed for &s;eeing better in
the du&s;k, than in the broad glare of &s;un-&s;hine. As in the eyes of tigers
and cats, that are formed <PB N="138" REF="161"> for a life of nocturnal
depredation, there is a quality in the retina that takes in the rays of light
&s;o copiou&s;ly as to permit their &s;eeing in places almo&s;t quite dark;
&s;o in the&s;e birds there is the &s;ame conformation of that organ, and
though, like us, they cannot &s;ee in a total ex|clu&s;ion of light, yet they
are &s;ufficiently quick-&s;ighted, at times when we remain in total
ob|&s;curity. In the eyes of all animals Nature hath made a complete
provi&s;ion, either to &s;hut out too much light, or to admit a &s;ufficiency,
by the contraction and dilatation of the pupil. In the&s;e birds the pupil is
capable of opening very wide, or &s;hutting very clo&s;e: by contracting the
pupil, the brighter light of the day, which would act too powerfully upon the
&s;en&s;ibility of the retina, is excluded; by dilating the pupil, the animal
takes in the more faint rays of the night, and thereby is enabled to &s;py its
prey, and catch it with greater facility in the dark. Be&s;ide this, there is
an irradiation on the back of the eye, and the very iris it&s;elf has a faculty
of reflecting the rays of light, &s;o as to a&s;&s;i&s;t vi&s;ion in the gloomy
places where the&s;e birds are found to frequent.</P>
<P>But though owls are dazzled by too bright a day-light, yet they
do not &s;ee be&s;t in the darke&s;t nights, as &s;ome have been apt to
imagine. It is in the du&s;k of the evening, or the grey of 
<PB N="139" REF="162"> the morning, that they are be&s;t fitted for &s;eeing;
at tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons when there is neither too much light, nor too little. It
is then that they i&s;&s;ue from their retreats, to hunt or to &s;urprize their
prey, which is u&s;ually attended with great &s;ucce&s;s: it is then that they
find all other birds a&s;leep, or preparing for repo&s;e, and they have only to
&s;eize the mo&s;t unguarded.</P>
<P>The nights when the moon &s;hines are the times of their mo&s;t
&s;ucce&s;sful plunder; for when it is wholly dark, they are le&s;s qualified
for &s;eeing and pur&s;uing their prey: except, there|fore, by moonlight, they
contract the hours of their chace; and if they come out at the ap|proach of
du&s;k in the evening, they return before it is totally dark, and then ri&s;e
by twi|light the next morning to pur&s;ue their game, and to return, in like
manner, before the broad day-light begins to dazzle them with its
&s;plendor.</P>
<P>Yet the faculty of &s;eeing in the night, or of being entirely
dazzled by day, is not alike in every &s;pecies of the&s;e nocturnal birds:
&s;ome &s;ee by night better than others; and &s;ome are &s;o little dazzled by
day-light, that they perceive their enemies and avoid them. The common White or
Barn Owl, for in&s;tance, &s;ees with &s;uch exqui&s;ite acutene&s;s in the
dark, that though the barn has been &s;hut at night, and the light 
<PB N="140" REF="163"> thus totally excluded, yet it perceives the &s;malle&s;t
mou&s;e that peeps from its hole: on the con|trary, the Brown Horn Owl is often
&s;een to prowl along the hedges by day, like the &s;parrow-hawk; and
&s;ometimes with good &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>All birds of the owl kind may be divided into two &s;orts;
tho&s;e that have horns, and tho&s;e without. The&s;e horns are nothing more
than two or three feathers that &s;tand up on each &s;ide of the head over the
ear, and give this animal a kind of horned appearance. Of the horned kind is,
the Great Horned Owl, which at fir&s;t view appears as large as an eagle. When
he comes to be ob&s;erved more clo&s;ely, however, he will be found much
le&s;s. His legs, body, wings and tail, are &s;horter; his head much larger and
thicker: his horns are compo&s;ed of feathers, that ri&s;e above two inches and
an half high, and which he can erect or depre&s;s at plea&s;ure: his eyes are
large and tran&s;parent, encircled with an orange-coloured iris: his ears are
large and deep, and it would appear that no animal was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a
more exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;e of hearing: his plumage is of a reddi&s;h brown,
marked on the back with black and yellow &s;pots, and yellow only upon the
belly.</P>
<P>Next to this is the Common Horned Owl, of a much &s;maller
&s;ize than the former, and with <PB N="141" REF="164"> horns much &s;horter.
As the great owl was five feet from the tip of one wing to the other, this is
but three. The horns are but about an inch long, and con&s;i&s;t of &s;ix
feathers, variegated with black and yellow.</P>
<P>There is &s;till a &s;maller kind of the horned owl, which is
not much larger than a black-bird; and who&s;e horns are remarkably &s;hort,
being compo&s;ed but of one feather, and that not above half an inch high.</P>
<P>To the&s;e &s;ucceeds the tribe without horns. The Howlet, which
is the large&s;t of this kind, with du&s;ky plumes, and black eyes; the Screech
Owl, of a &s;maller &s;ize, with blue eyes, and plumage of an iron grey; the
White Owl, about as large as the former, with yellow eyes and whiti&s;h
plumage; the Great Brown Owl, le&s;s than the former, with brown plumage and a
brown beak; and la&s;tly, the Little Brown Owl, with yellowi&s;h coloured eyes,
and an orange-coloured bill. To this catalogue might be added others of foreign
denominations, which differ but little from our own, if we except the Harfang,
or Great Hud&s;on's Bay Owl of Ed|wards, which is the large&s;t of all the
nocturnal tribe, and as white as the &s;nows of the country of which he is a
native.</P>
<P>All this tribe of animals, however they may differ in their
&s;ize and plumage, agree in their <PB N="142" REF="165"> general
characteri&s;tics of preying by night, and having their eyes formed for
nocturnal vi&s;ion. Their bodies are &s;trong and mu&s;cular; their feet and
claws made for tearing their prey; and their &s;tomachs for dige&s;ting it. It
mu&s;t be remarked, however, that the dige&s;tion of all birds that live upon
mice, lizards, or &s;uch like food, is not very perfect; for though they
&s;wallow them whole, yet they are always &s;een &s;ome time after to
di&s;gorge the &s;kin and bones, rolled up in a pellet, as being
in|dige&s;tible.</P>
<P>In proportion as each of the&s;e animals bears the day-light
be&s;t, he &s;ets forward earlier in the evening in pur&s;uit of his prey. The
great horned owl is the foremo&s;t in leaving his retreat; and ventures into
the woods and thickets very &s;oon in the evening. The horned, and the brown
owl, are later in their excur&s;ions: but the barn owl &s;eems to &s;ee be&s;t
in profound dark|ne&s;s; and &s;eldom leaves his hiding-place till
midnight.</P>
<P>As they are incapable of &s;upporting the light of the day, or
at lea&s;t of then &s;eeing and readily avoiding their danger, they keep all
this time concealed in &s;ome ob&s;cure retreat, &s;uited to their gloomy
appetites, and there continue in &s;olitude and &s;ilence. The cavern of a
rock, the darke&s;t part of an hollow tree, the battle|ments 
<PB N="143" REF="166"> of a ruined and unfrequented ca&s;tle, &s;ome ob&s;cure
hole in a farmer's out-hou&s;e, are the places where they are u&s;ually found:
if they be &s;een out of the&s;e retreats in the day-time, they may be
con&s;idered as having lo&s;t their way; as having by &s;ome accident been
thrown into the mid&s;t of their enemies, and &s;urrounded with danger.</P>
<P>Having &s;pent the day in their retreat, at the approach of
evening they &s;ally forth, and &s;kim rapidly up and down along the hedges.
The barn-owl indeed, who lives chiefly upon mice, is contented to be more
&s;tationary: he takes his re&s;idence upon &s;ome &s;hock of corn, or the
point of &s;ome old hou&s;e; and there watches in the dark, with the utmo&s;t
per&s;picacity and per|&s;everance.</P>
<P>Nor are the&s;e birds by any means &s;ilent; they all have an
hideous note; which, while pur&s;uing their prey, is &s;eldom heard; but may be
con&s;idered rather as a call to court&s;hip. There is &s;omething always
terrifying in this call, which is often heard in the &s;ilence of mid|night,
and breaks the general pau&s;e with an horrid variation. It is different in
all; but in each it is alarming and di&s;agreeable. Father Kircher, who has
&s;et the voices of birds to mu|&s;ic, has given all the tones of the owl note,
<PB N="144" REF="167"> which makes a mo&s;t tremendous melody. In|deed, the
prejudices of mankind are united with their &s;en&s;ations to make the cry of
the owl di&s;agreeable. The &s;creech-owl's voice was al|ways con&s;idered
among the people, as a pre&s;age of &s;ome &s;ad calamity that was &s;oon to
en&s;ue.</P>
<P>They &s;eldom, however, are heard while they are preying; that
important pur&s;uit is always attended with &s;ilence, as it is by no means
their intention to di&s;turb or forwarn tho&s;e little ani|mals they wi&s;h to
&s;urprize. When their pur&s;uit has been &s;ucce&s;sful, they &s;oon return to
their &s;o|litude, or to their young, if that be the &s;ea&s;on. If, however,
they find but little game, they con|tinue their que&s;t &s;till longer; and it
&s;ometimes happens that, obeying the dictates of appetite rather than of
prudence, they pur&s;ue &s;o long that broad day breaks in upon them, and
leaves them dazzled, bewildered, and at a di&s;tance from home.</P>
<P>In this di&s;tre&s;s they are obliged to take &s;helter in the
fir&s;t tree or hedge that offers, there to continue concealed all day, till
the returning darkne&s;s once more &s;upplies them with a better plan of the
country. But it too often happens that, with all their precaution to conceal
them&s;elves, they are &s;pied out by the other birds of the place, and are
&s;ure to receive <PB N="143" REF="168"> no mercy. The black-bird, the
thru&s;h, the jay, the bunting, and the red-brea&s;t, all come in file, and
employ their little arts of in&s;ult and abu&s;e. The &s;malle&s;t, the
feeble&s;t, and the mo&s;t contemptible of this unfortunate bird's enemies, are
then the foremo&s;t to injure and torment him. They encrea&s;e their cries and
turbulence round him, flap him with their wings, and are ready to &s;hew their
courage to be great, as they are &s;en&s;ible that their danger is but &s;mall.
The unfortunate owl, not knowing where to attack or where to fly, patiently
&s;its and &s;uffers all their in&s;ults. A&s;toni&s;hed and dizzy, he only
replies to their mockeries by aukward and ridiculous ge&s;tures, by turning his
head, and rolling his eyes with an air of &s;tupidity. It is enough that an owl
appears by day to &s;et the whole grove into a kind of uproar. Either the
aver&s;ion all the &s;mall birds have to this animal, or the
con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their own &s;ecurity, makes them pur&s;ue him without
cea&s;ing, while they encourage each other by their mutual cries to lend
a&s;&s;i&s;tance in this laudable undertaking.</P>
<P>It &s;ometimes happens, however, that the little birds pur&s;ue
their in&s;ults with the &s;ame impru|dent zeal with which the owl him&s;elf
had pur|&s;ued his depredations. They hunt him the whole day until evening
returns; which re|&s;toring <PB N="144" REF="169"> him his faculties of &s;ight
once more, he makes the foremo&s;t of his pur&s;uers pay dear for their former
&s;port: nor is man always an uncon|cerned &s;pectator here. The bird-catchers
have got an art of counterfeiting the cry of the owl exactly; and, having
before limed the branches of an hedge, they &s;it un&s;een and give the call.
At this, all the little birds flock to the place where they expect to find
their well-known ene|my; but in&s;tead of finding their &s;tupid anta|goni&s;t
they are &s;tuck fa&s;t to the hedge them|&s;elves. This &s;port mu&s;t be put
in practice an hour before night-fall in order to be &s;ucce&s;sful; for if it
is put off till later, tho&s;e birds which but a few minutes &s;ooner came to
provoke their enemy, will then fly from him with as much terror as they ju&s;t
before &s;hewed in&s;olence.</P>
<P>It is not unplea&s;ant to &s;ee one &s;tupid bird made in &s;ome
&s;ort a decoy to deceive another. The great horned owl is &s;ometimes made
u&s;e of for this purpo&s;e, to lure the kite when fal|coners de&s;ire to catch
him for the purpo&s;es of training the falcon. Upon this occa&s;ion they clap
the tail of a fox to the great owl to render his figure extraordinary; in which
trim he &s;ails &s;lowly along, flying low, which is his u&s;ual manner. The
kite, either curious to ob&s;erve this odd kind of animal, or perhaps
inqui&s;itive <PB N="145" REF="170"> to &s;ee whether it may not be proper for
food, flies after, and comes nearer and nearer. In this manner he continues to
hover, and &s;ome|times to de&s;cend, till the falconer &s;etting a
&s;trong-winged hawk again&s;t him, &s;eizes him for the purpo&s;e of training
his young ones at home.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual place where the great horned owl breeds is in the
cavern of a rock, the hollow of a tree, or the turret of &s;ome ruined
ca&s;tle. Its ne&s;t is near three feet in diameter, and com|po&s;ed of
&s;ticks, bound together by the fibrous roots of trees, and lined with leaves
on the in|&s;ide. It lays about three eggs, which are larger than tho&s;e of a
hen, and of a colour &s;omewhat re&s;embling the bird it&s;elf. The young ones
are very voracious, and the parents not le&s;s expert at &s;atisfying the call
of hunger. The le&s;&s;er owl of this kind never makes a ne&s;t for it&s;elf,
but always takes up with the old ne&s;t of &s;ome other bird, which it has
often been forced to abandon. It lays four or five eggs; and the young are all
white at fir&s;t, but change colour in about a fortnight. The other owls in
general build near the place where they chiefly prey; that which feeds upon
birds in &s;ome neighbour|ing grove, that which preys chiefly upon mice near
&s;ome farmer's yard, where the proprietor of the place takes care to give it
perfect &s;ecu|rity. <PB N="146" REF="171"> In fact, whatever mi&s;chief one
&s;pecies of owl may do in the woods, the barn-owl makes a &s;ufficient
recompen&s;e for, by being equally active in de&s;troying mice nearer home;
&s;o that a &s;ingle owl is &s;aid to be more &s;erviceable than half a dozen
cats, in ridding the barn of its dome&s;tic vermin. 
<Q REND="inline">"In the year 1580," &s;ays an old writer, "at
Hallontide, an army of mice &s;o over-run the mar&s;hes near Southmin&s;ter,
that they eat up the gra&s;s to the very roots. But at length a great number of
&s;trange painted owls came and devoured all the mice. The like happened again
in E&s;&s;ex about &s;ixty years after."</Q></P>
<P>To conclude our account of the&s;e birds, they are all very
&s;hy of man, and extremely indocile and difficult to be tamed. The white owl
in particular, as Mr. Buffon a&s;&s;erts, cannot be made to live in captivity;
I &s;uppo&s;e he means if it be taken when old. 
<Q REND="inline">"They live," &s;ays he, "ten or twelve days in
the aviary where they are &s;hut up; but they refu&s;e all kind of
nou|ri&s;hment, and at la&s;t die of hunger. By day they remain without moving
upon the floor of the aviary; in the evening, they mount on the highe&s;t
perch, where they continue to make a noi&s;e like a man &s;noring with his
mouth open. This &s;eems de&s;igned as a call <PB N="147" REF="172"> for their
old companions without; and, in fact, I have &s;een &s;everal others come to
the call, and perch upon the roof of the aviary, where they made the &s;ame
kind of hi&s;&s;ing, and &s;oon after permitted them&s;elves to be taken in a
net."</Q></P>

<HEAD>PART II. OF BIRDS OF THE POULTRY KIND.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="151" REF="174">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of Birds of the Poultry Kind.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the mo&s;t rapacious and noxious tribe of birds, we make a
tran&s;ition to tho&s;e which of all others are the mo&s;t harmle&s;s and the
mo&s;t &s;erviceable to man. He may force the rapacious tribes to a&s;&s;i&s;t
his plea&s;ures in the field, or induce the &s;maller warblers to delight him
with their &s;inging; but it is from the poultry kind that he derives the
mo&s;t &s;olid advantages, as they not only make a con&s;iderable addition to
the nece&s;&s;aries of life, but furni&s;h out the greate&s;t delicacies to
every entertainment.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t if not all the dome&s;tic birds of the poultry kind
that we maintain in our yards are of foreign extraction; but there are others
to be ranked in this cla&s;s that are as yet in a &s;tate of nature; and
perhaps only wait till they be|come &s;ufficiently &s;carce to be taken under
the care of man to multiply their propagation. It will appear remarkable
enough, if we con|&s;ider how much the tame poultry which we have imported from
di&s;tant climates has en|crea&s;ed, and how much tho&s;e wild birds of the
poultry kind that have never yet been taken <PB N="152" REF="175"> into keeping
have been dimini&s;hed and de|&s;troyed. They are all thinned; and many of the
&s;pecies, e&s;pecially in the more cultivated and populous parts of the
kingdom, are utterly un&s;een.</P>
<P>Under birds of the poultry kind I rank all tho&s;e that have
white fle&s;h, and, comparatively to their head and limbs, have bulky bodies.
They are furni&s;hed with &s;hort &s;trong bills for picking up grain, which is
their chief and often their only &s;u&s;tenance. Their wings are &s;hort and
concave; for which rea&s;on they are not able to fly far. They lay a great many
eggs; and, as they lead their young abroad the very day they are hatched, in
que&s;t of food, which they are &s;hewn by the mother, and which they pick up
for them&s;elves, they generally make their ne&s;ts on the ground. The toes of
all the&s;e are united by a membrane as far as the fir&s;t articulation, and
then are divided as in tho&s;e of the former cla&s;s.</P>
<P>Under this cla&s;s we may therefore rank the common cock, the
peacock, the turkey, the pintada or Guinea hen, the phea&s;ant, the bu|&s;tard,
the grous, the partridge, and the quail. The&s;e all bear a &s;trong
&s;imilitude to each other, being equally granivorous, fle&s;hy, and delicate 
<PB N="153" REF="176"> to the palate. The&s;e are among birds what bea&s;ts of
pa&s;ture are among quadrupedes, peaceable tenants of the field, and &s;hunning
the thicker parts of the fore&s;t, that abounds with numerous animals who carry
on uncea&s;ing ho|&s;tilities again&s;t them.</P>
<P>As Nature has formed the rapacious cla&s;s for war, &s;o &s;he
&s;eems equally to have fitted the&s;e for peace, re&s;t, and &s;ociety. Their
wings are but &s;hort, &s;o that they are ill formed for wan|dering from one
region to another; their bills are al&s;o &s;hort, and incapable of annoying
their oppo&s;ers; their legs are &s;trong indeed; but their toes are made for
&s;cratching up their food, and not for holding or tearing it. The&s;e are
&s;ufficient indications of their harmle&s;s na|ture; while their bodies, which
are fat and fle&s;hy, render them unwieldy travellers, and incapable of
&s;traying far from each other.</P>
<P>Accordingly we find them chiefly in &s;ociety; they live
together; and though they may have their di&s;putes, like all other animals,
upon &s;ome occa&s;ions; yet, when kept in the &s;ame di&s;trict, or fed in the
&s;ame yard, they learn the arts of &s;ubordination; and, in proportion as each
knows his &s;trength, he &s;eldom tries a &s;econd time the combat where he has
once been wor&s;ted.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="177">In this manner, all of this kind &s;eem to
lead an indolent voluptuous life: as they are fur|ni&s;hed internally with a
very &s;trong &s;tomach, commonly called a gizzard, &s;o their
voraciou&s;|ne&s;s &s;carce knows any bounds. If kept in clo&s;e captivity, and
&s;eparated from all their former companions, they &s;till have the plea&s;ure
of eat|ing left; and they &s;oon grow fat and unwieldy in their pri&s;on. To
&s;ay this more &s;imply, many of the wilder &s;pecies of birds, when cooped or
caged, pine away, grow gloomy, and &s;ome re|fu&s;e all &s;u&s;tenance
whatever; none except tho&s;e of the poultry kind grow fat, who &s;eem to
lo&s;e all remembrance of their former liberty, &s;atisfied with indolence and
plenty.</P>
<P>The poultry kind may be con&s;idered as &s;en&s;ual epicures,
&s;olely governed by their appetites. The indulgence of the&s;e &s;eems to
influence their other habits, and de&s;troys among them that con|nubial
fidelity for which mo&s;t other kinds are remarkable. The eagle and the falcon,
how fierce &s;oever to other animals, are yet gentle and true to each other;
their connexions when once formed continue till death; and the male and female
in every exigence and every duty lend faithful a&s;&s;i&s;tance to each other.
They a&s;&s;i&s;t each other in the production of their young, in 
<PB N="155" REF="178"> providing for them when produced; and even then, though
they drive them forth to fight their own battles, yet the old ones &s;till
retain their former affection to each other, and &s;eldom part far
a&s;under.</P>
<P>But it is very different with this luxurious cla&s;s I am now
de&s;cribing. Their court&s;hip is but &s;hort, and their congre&s;s
fortuitous. The male takes no heed of his offspring; and &s;a|tisfied with the
plea&s;ure of getting, leaves to the female all the care of providing for
po|&s;terity. Wild and irregular in his appetites, he ranges from one to
another; and claims every female which he is &s;trong enough to keep from his
fellows. Though timorous when oppo&s;ed to birds of prey, yet he is incredibly
bold among tho&s;e of his own kind; and but to &s;ee a male of his own
&s;pecies is &s;ufficient to pro|duce a combat. As his de&s;ires extend to all,
every creature becomes his enemy that pretends to be his rival.</P>
<P>The female, equally without fidelity or at|tachment, yields to
the mo&s;t powerful. She &s;tands by, a quiet meretricious &s;pectator of their
fury, ready to reward the conqueror with every compliance. She takes upon
her&s;elf all the labour of hatching and bringing up her <PB N="156" REF="179">
young, and chu&s;es a place for hatching as re|mote as po&s;&s;ible from the
cock. Indeed, &s;he gives her&s;elf very little trouble in making a ne&s;t, as
her young ones are to for&s;ake it the in&s;tant they part from the
&s;hell.</P>
<P>She is equally una&s;&s;i&s;ted in providing for her young, that
are not fed with meat put into their mouths, as in other cla&s;&s;es of the
feathered kind, but peck their food, and, for&s;aking their ne&s;ts, run here
and there, following the parent wherever it is to be found. She leads them
forward where they are likely to have the greate&s;t quan|tity of grain, and
takes care to &s;hew by pecking, the &s;ort proper for them to &s;eek for.
Though at other times voracious, &s;he is then ab&s;temious to an extreme
degree; and, intent only on pro|viding for and &s;hewing her young clutch their
food, &s;he &s;carce takes any nouri&s;hment her&s;elf. Her parental pride
&s;eems to overpower every other appetite; but that decrea&s;es in propor|tion
as her young ones are more able to provide for them&s;elves, and then all her
voracious habits return.</P>
<P>Among the other habits peculiar to this cla&s;s of birds is that
of du&s;ting them&s;elves. They lie flat in &s;ome du&s;ty place, and with
their wings and feet rai&s;e and &s;catter the du&s;t over 
<PB N="157" REF="180"> their whole body. What may be their rea&s;on for thus
doing it is not ea&s;y to explain. Per|haps the heat of their bodies is &s;uch,
that they require this powder to be interpo&s;ed between their feathers to keep
them from lying too clo&s;e together, and thus encrea&s;ing that heat with
which they are incommoded.</P>

<PB N="158" REF="181">
<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the Cock.</HEAD>
<P>ALL birds taken under the protection of man lo&s;e a part of
their natural figure, and are al|tered not only in their habits but their very
form. Climate, food, and captivity, are three very powerful agents in producing
the&s;e alte|rations; and tho&s;e birds that have longe&s;t felt their
influence under human direction, are the mo&s;t likely to have the greate&s;t
variety in their figures, their plumage, and their di&s;po&s;itions.</P>
<P>Of all other birds, the cock &s;eems to be the olde&s;t
companion of mankind, to have been fir&s;t reclaimed from the fore&s;t, and
taken to &s;upply the accidental failure of the luxuries or nece&s;&s;ities of
life. As he is thus longe&s;t under the care of man, &s;o of all others perhaps
he exhibits the greate&s;t number of varieties, there being &s;carce two birds
of this &s;pecies that ex|actly re&s;emble each other in plumage and form. The
tail, which makes &s;uch a beautiful figure in the generality of the&s;e birds,
is yet found en|tirely wanting in others; and not only the tail but the rump
al&s;o. The toes, which are u&s;ually four in all animals of the poultry kind,
yet in <PB N="161" REF="182"> a &s;pecies of the cock are found to amount to
five. The feathers, which lie &s;o &s;leek and in &s;uch beautiful order in
mo&s;t of tho&s;e we are ac|quainted with, are in a peculiar breed all
in|verted, and &s;tand &s;taring the wrong way. Nay, there is a &s;pecies that
comes from Japan, which in&s;tead of feathers &s;eems to be covered over with
hair. The&s;e and many other varieties are to be found in this animal, which
&s;eem to be the marks this early pri&s;oner bears of his long captivity.</P>
<P>It is not well a&s;certained when the cock was fir&s;t made
dome&s;tic in Europe; but it is ge|nerally agreed that we fir&s;t had him in
our we&s;tern world from the kingdom of Per&s;ia. Ari&s;tophanes calls the cock
the Per&s;ian bird, and tells us he enjoyed that kingdom before &s;ome of its
earlie&s;t monarchs. This animal was in fact known &s;o early even in the
mo&s;t &s;avage parts of Europe, that we are told the cock was one of the
forbidden foods among the ancient Britons. Indeed, the dome&s;tic fowl &s;eems
to have bani&s;hed the wild one. Per&s;ia it&s;elf, that fir&s;t introduced it
to our acquaintance, &s;eems no longer to know it in its natural form; and if
we did not find it wild in &s;ome of the woods of India, as well as tho&s;e of
the i&s;lands in the Indian Ocean, we might begin to doubt, as 
<PB N="158" REF="183"> <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"> 
<PB N="161" REF="184"> <GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"> 
<PB N="162" REF="185"> we do with regard to the &s;heep, in what form it
fir&s;t exi&s;ted in a &s;tate of nature.</P>
<P>But tho&s;e doubts no longer exi&s;t: the cock is found in the
i&s;lands of Tinian, in many others of the Indian Ocean, and in the woods on
the coa&s;ts of Malabar, in his ancient &s;tate of in|dependance. In his wild
condition, his plu|mage is black and yellow, and his comb and wattles yellow
and purple. There is ano|ther peculiarity al&s;o in tho&s;e of the Indian
woods; their bones which when boiled with us are white, as every body knows, in
tho&s;e are as black as ebony. Whether this tincture pro|ceeds from their food,
as the bones are tinc|tured red by feeding upon madder, I leave to the
di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of others: &s;atisfied with the fact, let us decline
&s;peculation.</P>
<P>In their fir&s;t propagation in Europe, there were
di&s;tinctions then that now &s;ub&s;i&s;t no longer. The ancients e&s;teemed
tho&s;e fowls who&s;e plu|mage was redi&s;h as invaluable; but as for the white
it was con&s;idered as utterly unfit for dome&s;tic purpo&s;es. The&s;e they
regarded as &s;ubject to become a prey to rapacious birds; and Ari&s;totle
thinks them le&s;s fruitful than the former. Indeed, his divi&s;ion of tho&s;e
birds &s;eems taken from their culinary u&s;es; the one &s;ort he calls
generous and noble, being remark|able for fecundity; the other &s;ort, ignoble
and <PB N="163" REF="186"> u&s;ele&s;s, from their &s;terility. The&s;e
di&s;tinctions differ widely from our modern notions of gene|ro&s;ity in this
animal; that which we call the game-cock being by no means &s;o fruitful as the
ungenerous dunghill-cock, which we treat with contempt. The Athenians had their
cock-matches as well as we; but it is probable they did not enter into our
refinement of chu&s;ing out the mo&s;t barren of the &s;pecies for the
pur|po&s;es of combat.</P>
<P>However this be, no animal in the world has greater courage than
the cock when oppo&s;ed to one of his own &s;pecies; and in every part of the
world where refinement and poli&s;hed man|ners have not entirely taken place,
cock-fighting is a principal diver&s;ion. In China, India, the Philipine
I&s;lands, and all over the ea&s;t, cock-fighting is the &s;port and
amu&s;ement even of kings and princes. With us it is declining every day; and
it is to be hoped it will in time become only the pa&s;time of the lowe&s;t
vulgar. It is the opinion of many that we have a bolder and more valiant breed
than is to be found el&s;ewhere; and &s;ome, indeed, have entered into a
&s;erious di&s;cu&s;&s;ion upon the cau&s;e of &s;o flattering a
&s;in|gularity. But the truth is, they have cocks in China as bold, if not
bolder, than ours; and, what would &s;till be con&s;idered as valuable 
<PB N="164" REF="187"> among cockers here, they have more &s;trength with
le&s;s weight. Indeed, I have often won|dered why men who lay two or three
hun|dred pounds upon the prowe&s;s of a &s;ingle cock, have not taken every
method to improve the breed. Nothing, it is probable, could do this more
effectually than by cro&s;&s;ing the &s;train, as it is called, by a foreign
mixture; and whe|ther having recour&s;e even to the wild cock in the fore&s;ts
of India would not be u&s;eful, I leave to their con&s;ideration. However, it
is a mean and ungenerous amu&s;ement, nor would I wi&s;h much to promote it.
The truth is, I could give &s;uch in&s;tructions with regard to cock-fighting,
and could &s;o arm one of the&s;e animals again&s;t the other, that it would be
almo&s;t im|po&s;&s;ible for the adver&s;ary's cock to &s;urvive the fir&s;t or
&s;econd blow; but, as Boerhave has &s;aid upon a former occa&s;ion, when he
was treating upon poi&s;ons, 
<Q REND="inline">"to teach the arts of cruelty is equivalent to
committing them."</Q></P>
<P>This extraordinary courage in the cock is thought to proceed
from his being the mo&s;t &s;alacious of all other birds what&s;oever. A
&s;ingle cock &s;uffices for ten or a dozen hens; and it is &s;aid of him that
he is the only animal who&s;e &s;pirits are not abated by indulgence. But then
he &s;oon grows old; the radical moi&s;ture is <PB N="165" REF="188">
exhau&s;ted; and in three or four years he be|comes utterly unfit for the
purpo&s;es of impreg|nation. 
<Q REND="inline">"Hens al&s;o," to u&s;e the words of
Wil|loughby, "as they for the greate&s;t part of the year daily lay eggs,
cannot &s;uffice for &s;o many births, but for the mo&s;t part after three
years become effete and barren: for when they have exhau&s;ted all their
&s;eed-eggs, of which they had but a certain quantity from the begin|ning, they
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily cea&s;e to lay, there being no new ones generated
within."</Q></P>
<P>The hen &s;eldom clutches a brood of chickens above once a
&s;ea&s;on, though in&s;tances have been known in which they produced two. The
number of eggs a dome&s;tic hen will lay in the year are above two hundred,
provided &s;he be well fed and &s;upplied with water and liberty. It matters
not much whether &s;he be trodden by the cock or no; &s;he will continue to
lay, al|though all the eggs of this kind can never by hatching be brought to
produce a living ani|mal. Her ne&s;t is made without any care, if left to
her&s;elf; a hole &s;cratched into the ground, among a few bu&s;hes, is the
only preparation &s;he makes for this &s;ea&s;on of patient expectation.
Nature, almo&s;t exhau&s;ted by its own fecundity, &s;eems to inform her of the
proper time for hatching, which &s;he her&s;elf te&s;tifies by a clucking 
<PB N="166" REF="189"> note, and by di&s;continuing to lay. The good
hou&s;ewives, who often get more by their hens laying than by their chickens,
often artifi|cially protract this clucking &s;ea&s;on, and &s;ome|times
entirely remove it. As &s;oon as their hen begins to cluck, they &s;tint her in
her provi&s;ions; which, if that fails, they plunge her into cold water; this,
for the time, effectually puts back her hatching; but then it often kills the
poor bird, who takes cold and dies under the operation.</P>
<P>If left entirely to her&s;elf, the hen would &s;el|dom lay above
twenty eggs in the &s;ame ne&s;t, without attempting to hatch them: but in
pro|portion as &s;he lays, her eggs are removed; and &s;he continues to lay,
vainly hoping to encrea&s;e the number. In the wild &s;tate, the hen &s;eldom
lays above fifteen eggs; but then her provi&s;ion is more difficultly obtained,
and &s;he is perhaps &s;en&s;ible of the difficulty of maintaining too numerous
a family.</P>
<P>When the hen begins to &s;it, nothing can exceed her
per&s;everance and patience; &s;he con|tinues for &s;ome days immoveable; and
when forced away by the importunities of hunger, &s;he quickly returns.
Sometimes al&s;o her eggs become too hot for her to bear, e&s;pecially if &s;he
be furni&s;hed with too warm a ne&s;t within doors, for then &s;he is obliged
to leave them to cool a little: thus the warmth of the ne&s;t only retards 
<PB N="167" REF="190"> incubation, and often puts the brood a day or two back
in the &s;hell. While the hen &s;its, &s;he carefully turns her eggs, and even
removes them to different &s;ituations; till at length, in about three weeks,
the young brood begin to give &s;igns of a de&s;ire to bur&s;t their
confinement. When by the repeated efforts of their bill, which &s;erves like a
pioneer on this occa&s;ion, they have broke them&s;elves a pa&s;&s;age through
the &s;hell, the hen &s;till continues to &s;it till all are excluded. The
&s;tronge&s;t and be&s;t chickens generally are the fir&s;t candidates for
liberty; the weake&s;t come behind, and &s;ome even die in the &s;hell. When
all are produced, &s;he then leads them forth to provide for them&s;elves. Her
affection and her pride &s;eem then to alter her very nature, and correct her
imperfections. No longer voracious or cowardly, &s;he ab&s;tains from all food
that her young can &s;wallow, and flies boldly at every creature that &s;he
thinks is likely to do them mi&s;chief. Whatever the invading animal be, &s;he
boldly attacks him; the hor&s;e, the hog, or the ma&s;tiff. When marching at
the head of her little troop, &s;he acts the commander, and has a variety of
notes to call her numerous train to their food, or to warn them of approaching
danger. Upon one of the&s;e occa&s;ions, I have &s;een the whole brood run for
&s;ecurity into the <PB N="168" REF="191"> thicke&s;t part of an hedge, while
the hen her&s;elf ventured boldly forth, and faced a fox that came for plunder.
With a good ma&s;tiff, how|ever, we &s;oon &s;ent the invader back to his
re|treat; but not before he had wounded the hen in &s;everal places.</P>
<P>Ten or twelve chickens are the greate&s;t num|ber that a good
hen can rear and clutch at a time; but as this bears no proportion to the
number of her eggs, &s;chemes have been ima|gined to clutch all the eggs of an
hen, and thus turn her produce to the greate&s;t advantage. By the&s;e
contrivances it has been obtained that a hen that ordinarily produces but
twelve chickens in the year, is found to produce as many chickens as eggs, and
con&s;equently often above two hundred. The contrivance I mean is the
ar|tificial method of hatching chickens in &s;toves, as is practi&s;ed at Grand
Cairo; or in a chy|mical elaboratory properly graduated, as has been effected
by Mr. Reaumur. At Grand Cairo, they thus produce &s;ix or &s;even thou&s;and
chickens at a time; where, as they are brought forth in their mild &s;pring,
which is warmer than our &s;ummer, the young ones thrive without clutching. But
it is otherwi&s;e in our colder and unequal climate; the little animal may,
without much difficulty, be hatched from the <PB N="169" REF="192"> &s;hell;
but they almo&s;t all peri&s;h when excluded. To remedy this, Reaumur has made
u&s;e of a woolen hen, as he calls it; which was nothing more than putting the
young ones in a warm ba&s;ket, and clapping over them a thick woolen canopy. I
&s;hould think a much better &s;ub&s;titute might be found; and this from among
the &s;pe|cies them&s;elves. Capons may very ea&s;ily be taught to clutch a
fre&s;h brood of chickens throughout the year; &s;o that when one little colony
is thus reared, another may be brought to &s;ucceed it. Nothing is more common
than to &s;ee capons thus employed; and the manner of teaching them is this:
fir&s;t the capon is made very tame, &s;o as to feed from one's hand; then,
about evening, they pluck the feathers off his brea&s;t, and rub the bare
&s;kin with nettles; they then put the chickens to him, which pre&s;ently run
under his brea&s;t and belly, and probably rubbing his bare &s;kin gently with
their heads, allay the &s;tinging pain which the nettles had ju&s;t produced.
This is repeated for two or three nights, till the animal takes an affection to
the chickens that have thus given him relief, and continues to give them the
protection they &s;eek for: perhaps al&s;o the querulous voice of the chickens
may be plea&s;ant to him in mi&s;ery, and invite him to &s;uccour the
di&s;tre&s;t. He from <PB N="170" REF="193"> that time brings up a brood of
chickens like a hen, clutching them, feeding them, clucking, and performing all
the functions of the tendere&s;t parent. A capon once accu&s;tomed to this
&s;er|vice, will not give over; but when one brood is grown up, he may have
another nearly hatched put under him, which he will treat with the &s;ame
tenderne&s;s he did the former.</P>
<P>The cock, from his &s;alaciou&s;ne&s;s, is allowed to be a
&s;hort lived animal; but how long the&s;e birds live, if left to them&s;elves,
is not yet well a&s;certained by any hi&s;torian. As they are kept only for
profit, and in a few years become unfit for generation, there are few that,
from mere motives of curio&s;ity, will make the tedious experiment of
maintaining a proper number till they die. Aldrovandus hints their age to be
ten years; and it is probable that this may be its extent. They are &s;ubject
to &s;ome di&s;orders, which it is not our bu&s;ine&s;s to de&s;cribe; and as
for poi&s;ons, be&s;ides nux vomica, which is fatal to mo&s;t animals except
man, they are injured, as Linnaeus a&s;&s;erts, by elder-berries; of which they
are not a little fond.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP III. Of the Peacock.</HEAD>
<P>THE Peacock, by the common people of Italy, is &s;aid to have
the plumage of an angel, the voice of a devil, and the guts of a thief. In
fact, each of the&s;e qualities mark pretty well the nature of this
extraordinary bird. When it appears with its tail expanded, there is none of
the feathered creation can vie with it for beauty; yet the horrid &s;cream of
its voice &s;erves to abate the plea&s;ure we find from viewing it; and &s;till
more, its in&s;atiable gluttony and &s;pirit of depredation make it one of the
mo&s;t noxious dome&s;tics that man has taken under his protection.</P>
<P>Our fir&s;t peacocks were brought from the Ea&s;t Indies; and we
are a&s;&s;ured, that they are &s;till found in va&s;t flocks, in a wild
&s;tate, in the i&s;lands of Java and Ceylone. So beautiful a bird, and one
e&s;teemed &s;uch a delicacy at the tables of the luxurious, could not be
permitted to con|tinue long at liberty in its di&s;tant retreats. So early as
the days of Solomon, we find in his navies, among the articles imported from
the Ea&s;t, apes and peacocks. Aelian relates, <PB N="172" REF="195"> that they
were brought into Greece from &s;ome barbarous country, and were held in &s;uch
high e&s;teem among them, that a male and female were valued at above thirty
pounds of our money. We are told al&s;o, that when Alexander was in India, he
found them flying wild, in va&s;t numbers, on the banks of the river Hya|rotis,
and was &s;o &s;truck with their beauty, that he laid a &s;evere fine and
puni&s;hment on all who &s;hould kill or di&s;turb them. Nor are we to be
&s;uprized at this, as the Greeks were &s;o much &s;truck with the beauty of
this bird, when fir&s;t brought among them, that every per&s;on paid a fixed
price for &s;eeing it; and &s;everal people came to Athens, from Lace|demon and
The&s;&s;aly, purely to &s;atisfy their cu|rio&s;ity.</P>
<P>It was probably fir&s;t introduced into the We&s;t, merely on
account of its beauty; but mankind, from contemplating its figure, &s;oon came
to think of &s;erving it up for a different en|tainment. Aufidius Hurco
&s;tands charged by Pliny with being the fir&s;t who fatted up the peacock for
the fea&s;ts of the luxurious. What|ever there may be of delicacy in the
fle&s;h of a young peacock, it is certain an old one is very indifferent
eating; neverthele&s;s, there is no mention made of chu&s;ing the younge&s;t:
it is <PB N="173" REF="196"> probable they were killed indi&s;criminately, the
beauty of the feathers in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;timu|lating the appetite.
Horten&s;ius the orator was the fir&s;t who &s;erved them up at an
entertainment at Rome; and from that time they were con|&s;idered as one of the
greate&s;t ornaments of every fea&s;t. Whether the Roman method of cookery,
which was much higher than ours, might not have rendered them more palatable
than we find them at pre&s;ent, I cannot tell: but certain it is, they talk of
the peacock as being the fir&s;t of viands.</P>
<P>Its fame for delicacy, however, did not con|tinue very long; for
we find, in the times of Francis the Fir&s;t, that it was a cu&s;tom to &s;erve
up peacocks to the tables of the great, with an intention not to be eaten, but
only to be &s;een. Their manner was to &s;trip off the &s;kin; and then
preparing the body with the warme&s;t &s;pices, they covered it up again in its
former &s;kin, with all its plumage in full di&s;play, and no way injured by
the preparation. The bird thus prepared, was often pre&s;erved for many years
without corrupting; and it is a&s;&s;erted of the peacock's fle&s;h, that it
keeps longer unputrefied than that of any other animal. To give a higher ze&s;t
to the&s;e entertainments, on weddings particularly, they filled the bird's
beak and throat with cotton <PB N="174" REF="197"> and camphire, which they
&s;et on fire, to amu&s;e and delight the company. I do not know that the
peacock is much u&s;ed at our entertainments at pre&s;ent, except now and then
at an alderman's dinner or a common-council fea&s;t, when our citizens
re&s;olve to be &s;plendid; and even then it is never &s;erved with its cotton
and camphire.</P>
<P>Like other birds of the poultry kind, the peacock feeds upon
corn; but its chief predi|lection is for barley. But as it is a very proud and
fickle bird, there is &s;carce any food that it will not at times covet and
pur&s;ue. In&s;ects and tender plants are often eagerly &s;ought at a time that
it has a &s;ufficiency of its natural food pro|vided more nearly. In the
indulgence of the&s;e capricious pur&s;uits, walls cannot ea&s;ily confine it;
it &s;trips the tops of hou&s;es of their tiles or thatch, it lays wa&s;te the
labours of the gardener, roots up his choice&s;t &s;eeds, and nips his
favourite flowers in the bud. Thus its beauty but ill re|compen&s;es for the
mi&s;chief it occa&s;ions; and many of the more homely looking fowls are very
de&s;ervedly preferred before it.</P>
<P>Nor is the peacock le&s;s a debauchee in its affections, than a
glutton in its appetites. He is &s;till more &s;alacious than even the cock;
and though not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;ame vigour, yet burns with more
immoderate de&s;ire. He re|quires <PB N="175" REF="198"> five females at
lea&s;t to attend him; and if there be not a &s;ufficient number, he will even
run upon and tread the &s;itting hen. For this rea&s;on, the pea-hen
endeavours, as much as &s;he can, to hide her ne&s;t from the male, as he would
otherwi&s;e di&s;turb her &s;itting, and break her eggs.</P>
<P>The pea-hen &s;eldom lays above five or &s;ix eggs in this
climate before &s;he &s;its. Ari&s;totle de&s;cribes her as laying twelve; and
it is pro|bable, in her native climate, &s;he may be thus prolific; for it is
certain, that in the fore&s;ts where they breed naturally, they are numerous
beyond expre&s;&s;ion. This bird lives about twenty years; and not till its
third year has it that beau|tiful variegated plumage that adorns its tail.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"In the kingdom of Cambaya," &s;ays Tave|ner,
"near the city of Baroch, whole flocks of them are &s;een in the fields. They
are very &s;hy, however, and it is impo&s;&s;ible to come near them. They run
off &s;wifter than the partridge; and hide them&s;elves in thickets, where it
is impo&s;&s;ible to find them. They perch, by night, upon trees; and the
fowler often approaches them at that &s;ea&s;on with a kind of banner, on which
a peacock is painted to the life, on either &s;ide. A lighted torch is fixed on
the top of this decoy; and the peacock, when di&s;turbed, flies to what it
takes <PB N="176" REF="199"> for another, and is thus caught in a nooze
prepared for that purpo&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>There are varieties of this bird, &s;ome of which are white,
others cre&s;ted: that which is called the Peacock of Thibet, is the mo&s;t
beautiful of the feathered creation, containing in its plumage all the mo&s;t
vivid colours, red, blue, yellow, and green, di&s;po&s;ed in an almo&s;t
artificial order, as if merely to plea&s;e the eye of the beholder.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. The Turkey.</HEAD>
<P>THE natal place of the cock and the peacock is pretty well
a&s;certained, but there are &s;tronger doubts concerning the Turkey; &s;ome
contend|ing that it has been brought into Europe from the Ea&s;t Indies many
centuries ago; while others a&s;&s;ert, that it is wholly unknown in that part
of the world, that it is a native of the New Continent, and that it was not
brought into Europe till the di&s;covery of that part of the world.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who contend for the latter opinion, very truly
ob&s;erve, that among all the de&s;crip|tions we have of Ea&s;tern birds, that
of the turkey is not to be found; while, on the contrary, it is very well known
in the New Continent, where it runs wild about the woods. It is &s;aid, by
them, to be fir&s;t &s;een in France, in the reign of Francis the Fir&s;t; and
in England, in that of Henry the Eighth; which is about the time when Mexico
was fir&s;t conquered by Spain. On the other hand, it is a&s;&s;erted, that the
turkey, &s;o far from being unknown in Eu|rope before that time, was known even
to the <PB N="178" REF="201"> antients; and that Aelian has given a pretty
ju&s;t de&s;cription of it. They alledge, that its very name implies its having
been brought from &s;ome part of the Ea&s;t; and that it is found, among other
dainties &s;erved up to the tables of the great, before that time among
our&s;elves. But what they pretend to be the &s;tronge&s;t proof is, that
though the wild turkey be &s;o very com|mon in America, yet the natives cannot
con|trive to tame it; and though hatched in the ordinary manner, nothing can
render it dome&s;tic. In this diver&s;ity of opinions, perhaps it is be&s;t to
&s;u&s;pend a&s;&s;ent, till more lights are thrown on the &s;ubject; however,
I am inclined to concur with the former opinion.</P>
<P>With us, when young, it is one of the ten|dere&s;t of all birds;
yet, in its wild &s;tate, it is found in great plenty in the fore&s;ts of
Canada, that are covered with &s;now above three parts of the year. In their
natural woods, they are found much larger than in their &s;tate of dome&s;tic
captivity. They are much more beautiful al&s;o, their feathers being of a dark
grey, bordered at the edges with a bright gold colour. The&s;e the &s;avages of
the country weave into cloaks to adorn their per&s;ons, and fa&s;hion into fans
and umbrellas, but never once think of taking into keeping animals that the
woods furni&s;h <PB N="179" REF="202"> them with in &s;ufficient abundance.
Savage man &s;eems to find a delight in precarious po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. A great
part of the plea&s;ure of the chace lies in the uncertainty of the pur&s;uit,
and he is un|willing to abridge him&s;elf in any accidental &s;ucce&s;s that
may attend his fatigues. The hunting the turkey therefore, makes one of his
principal diver&s;ions; as its fle&s;h contributes chiefly to the &s;upport of
his family. When he has di&s;covered the place of their retreat, which, in
general, is near fields of nettles, or where there is plenty of any kind of
grain, he takes his dog with him, which is trained to the &s;port, (a faithful
rough creature, &s;uppo&s;ed to be originally reclaimed from the wolf) and he
&s;ends him into the mid&s;t of the flock. The turkies no &s;ooner perceive
their enemy, than they &s;et off running at full &s;peed, and with &s;uch
&s;wiftne&s;s that they leave the dog far behind them: he follows
neverthele&s;s, and &s;en&s;ible they mu&s;t &s;oon be tired, as they cannot go
full &s;peed for any length of time, he, at la&s;t, forces them to take
&s;helter in a tree, where they &s;it quite &s;pent and fatigued, till the
hunter comes up, and, with a long pole, knocks them down one after the
other.</P>
<P>This manner of &s;uffering them&s;elves to be de&s;troyed,
argues no great in&s;tinct in the ani|mal; <PB N="180" REF="203"> and indeed,
in their captive &s;tate, they do not appear to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of much.
They &s;eem a &s;tupid, vain, querulous tribe, apt enough to quarrel among
them&s;elves, yet without any weapons to do each other an injury. Every body
knows the &s;trange antipathy the turkey-cock has to a red colour; how he
bri&s;tles, and, with his peculiar gobbling &s;ound, flies to at|tack it. But
there is another method of encrea&s;|ing the animo&s;ity of the&s;e birds
again&s;t each other, which is often practi&s;ed by boys, when they have a mind
for a battle. This is no more than to &s;mear over the head of one of the
turkies with dirt, and the re&s;t run to attack it with all the &s;peed of
impotent animo&s;ity: nay, two of them, thus di&s;gui&s;ed, will fight each
other till they are almo&s;t &s;uffocated with fatigue and anger.</P>
<P>But though &s;o furious among them&s;elves, they are weak and
cowardly again&s;t other animals, though far le&s;s powerful than they. The
cock often makes the turkey keep at a di&s;tance; and they &s;eldom venture to
attack him but with united force, when they rather oppre&s;s him by their
weight, than annoy him by their arms. There is no animal, how contemptible
&s;oever, that will venture boldly to face the turkey-cock, that he will not
fly from. On the contrary, with the in&s;olence of a bully, he pur&s;ues any 
<PB N="181" REF="204"> thing that &s;eems to fear him, particularly lap-dogs
and children, again&s;t both which he &s;eems to have a peculiar aver&s;ion. On
&s;uch occa&s;ions, after he has made them &s;camper, he returns to his female
train, di&s;plays his plumage around, &s;truts about the yard, and gobbles out
a note of &s;elf-approbation.</P>
<P>The female &s;eems of a milder, gentler di&s;|po&s;ition. Rather
querulous than bold, &s;he hunts about in que&s;t of grain, and pur&s;uit of
in&s;ects, being particularly delighted with the eggs of ants and caterpillars.
She lays eighteen or twenty eggs, larger than tho&s;e of a hen, whiti&s;h, but
marked with &s;pots re&s;embling the freckles of the face. Her young are
extremely tender at fir&s;t, and mu&s;t be carefully fed with curd chopped with
dock leaves; but as they grow older, they become more hardy, and fol|low the
mother to con&s;iderable di&s;tances, in pur&s;uit of in&s;ect food, which they
prefer to any other. On the&s;e occa&s;ions, however, the female, though &s;o
large and, as it would &s;eem, &s;o powerful a bird, gives them but very little
protection again&s;t the attacks of any rapacious animal that comes in her way.
She rather warns her young to &s;hift for them&s;elves, than prepares to defend
them. 
<Q REND="inline">"I have heard," <PB N="182" REF="205"> &s;ays
the Abbe la Pluche, "a turkey hen, when at the head of her brood, &s;end forth
the mo&s;t hideous &s;cream, without knowing as yet the cau&s;e: however, her
young, immediately when the warning was given, &s;kulked under the bu&s;hes,
the gra&s;s, or whatever el&s;e offered for &s;helter or protection. They even
&s;tretched them&s;elves at their full length upon the ground, and continued
lying as motionle&s;s as if they were dead. In the mean time, the mother, with
her eyes directed upwards, continued her cries and &s;creaming as before. Upon
looking up to where &s;he &s;eemed to gaze, I di&s;covered a black &s;pot
ju&s;t under the clouds, but was unable at fir&s;t to determine what it was;
however, it &s;oon appeared to be a bird of prey, though at fir&s;t at too
great a di&s;tance to be di&s;tingui&s;hed. I have &s;een one of the&s;e
animals continue in this violent agitated &s;tate, and her whole brood pinned
down as it were to the ground, for four hours together; whil&s;t their
formidable &s;oe has taken his circuits, has mounted, and hovered directly over
their heads: at la&s;t, upon di&s;appearing, the parent began to change her
note, and &s;ent forth another cry, which in an in&s;tant gave life to the
whole trembling tribe, and they all flocked round her with expre&s;&s;ions of 
<PB N="183" REF="206"> plea&s;ure, as if con&s;cious of their happy e&s;cape
from danger."</Q></P>
<P>When once grown up, turkies are very hardy birds, and feed
them&s;elves at very little expence to the farmer. Tho&s;e of Norfolk are
&s;aid to be the large&s;t of this kingdom, weighing from twenty to thirty
pounds. There are places, however, in the Ea&s;t Indies, where they are known
only in their dome&s;tic &s;tate, in which they grow to the weight of &s;ixty

told that when Crae&s;us, king of Lydia, was &s;eated on his throne, adorned
with royal magnificence, and all the barbarous pomp of ea&s;tern &s;plendour,
he a&s;ked Solon if he had ever beheld any thing &s;o fine! The Greek
phi|lo&s;opher, no way moved by the objects before him, or taking a pride in
his native &s;implicity, replied, that after having &s;een the beautiful 
<PB N="185" REF="208"> plumage of the phea&s;ant, he could be a&s;toni&s;hed at
no other finery.</P>
<P>In fact, nothing can &s;atisfy the eye with a greater variety
and richne&s;s of ornament than this beautiful creature. The iris of the eyes
is yellow; and the eyes them&s;elves are &s;urrounded with a &s;carlet colour,
&s;prinkled with &s;mall &s;pecks of black. On the fore-part of the head there
are blacki&s;h feathers mixed with a &s;hining purple. The top of the head and
the upper part of the neck are tinged with a darki&s;h green that &s;hines like
&s;ilk In &s;ome, the top of the head is of a &s;hining blue, and the head
it&s;elf, as well as the upper part of the neck, appears &s;ometimes blue and
&s;ometimes green, as it is differently placed to the eye of the &s;pectator.
The feathers of the brea&s;t, the &s;houlders, the middle of the back, and the
&s;ides under the wings, have a blacki&s;h ground, with edges tinged of an
exqui&s;ite colour, which appears &s;ometimes black and &s;ometimes purple,
accord|ing to the different lights it is placed in; under the purple there is a
tran&s;ver&s;e &s;treak of gold colour. The tail, from the middle feathers to
the root, is about eighteen inches long; the legs, the feet and the toes, are
of the colour of horn. There are black &s;purs on the legs, &s;horter than
tho&s;e of a cock; there is a mem|brane <PB N="186" REF="209"> that connects
two of the toes together; and the male is much more beautiful than the
female.</P>
<P>This bird, though &s;o beautiful to the eye, is not le&s;s
delicate when &s;erved up to the table. Its fle&s;h is con&s;idered as the
greate&s;t dainty; and when the old phy&s;icians &s;poke of the
whole|&s;omene&s;s of any viands, they made their com|pari&s;on with the
fle&s;h of the phea&s;ant. How|ever, notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e perfections
to tempt the curio&s;ity or the palate, the phea&s;ant has multiplied in its
wild &s;tate; and, as if di&s;daining the protection of man, has left him to
take &s;helter in the thicke&s;t woods and the remote&s;t fore&s;ts. All others
of the dome&s;tic kind, the cock, the turkey, or the pintada, when once
reclaimed, have &s;till continued in their dome&s;tic &s;tate, and per&s;evered
in the ha|bits and appetites of willing &s;lavery. But the phea&s;ant, though
taken from its native warm retreats, where the woods &s;upply variety of food,
and the warm &s;un &s;uits its tender con|&s;titution, has &s;till continued
its attachment to native freedom; and now wild among us, makes the mo&s;t
envied ornament of our parks and fo|re&s;ts, where he feeds upon acorns and
berries, and the &s;canty produce of our chilling cli|mate.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="210">This &s;pirit of independance &s;eems to
attend the phea&s;ant even in captivity. In the woods, the hen phea&s;ant lays
from eighteen to twenty eggs in a &s;ea&s;on; but in a dome&s;tic &s;tate &s;he
&s;eldom lays above ten. In the &s;ame manner, when wild, &s;he hatches and
leads up her brood with patience, vigilance and courage; but when kept tame,
&s;he never &s;its well; &s;o that a hen is generally her &s;ub&s;titute upon
&s;uch occa|&s;ions; and as for leading her young to their food, &s;he is
utterly ignorant of where it is to be found; and the young birds &s;tarve, if
left &s;olely to her protection. The phea&s;ant, there|fore, on every account,
&s;eems better left at large in the woods than reclaimed to pri&s;tine
captivity. Its fecundity when wild is &s;ufficient to &s;tock the fore&s;t; its
beautiful plumage adorns it; and its fle&s;h retains a higher flavour from its
unlimited freedom.</P>
<P>However, it has been the aim of late to take the&s;e birds once
more from the woods, and to keep them in places fitted for their reception.
Like all others of the poultry kind, they have no great &s;agacity, and
&s;uffer them&s;elves ea&s;ily to be taken. At night they roo&s;t upon the
highe&s;t trees of the wood; and by day they come down into the lower brakes
and bu&s;hes, where their food is chiefly found. They gene|rally 
<PB N="188" REF="211"> make a kind of flapping noi&s;e when they are with the
females; and this often apprizes the &s;port&s;man of their retreats. At other
times he tracks them in the &s;now, and frequently takes them in &s;prings. But
of all birds they are &s;hot mo&s;t ea&s;ily, as they always make a whirring
noi&s;e when they ri&s;e, by which they alarm the gunner, and being a large
mark, and flying very &s;low, there is &s;carce any mi&s;&s;ing them.</P>
<Q> 
<L>Ah! what avail his glo&s;&s;y, varying dyes,</L> 
<L>His purpled cre&s;t and &s;carlet-circled eyes,</L> 
<L>The vivid green his &s;hining plumes unfold,</L> 
<L>His painted wings, and brea&s;t that flames with gold?</L> 
<BIBL>POPE.</BIBL></Q>
<P>When the&s;e birds are taken young into keep|ing, they become as
familiar as chickens; and when they are de&s;igned for breeding, they are put
together in a yard, five hens to a cock; for this bird, like all of the poultry
kind, is very &s;alacious. In her natural &s;tate the female makes her ne&s;t
of dry gra&s;s and leaves; the &s;ame mu&s;t be laid for her in the
phea&s;andry, and &s;he her&s;elf will &s;ometimes properly di&s;po&s;e them.
If &s;he refu&s;es to hatch her eggs, then a common hen mu&s;t be got to
&s;upply her place, which ta&s;k &s;he will perform with per&s;everance and
&s;ucce&s;s. The young ones are very difficult to be reared; and they mu&s;t be
&s;upplied with <PB N="189" REF="212"> ants-eggs, which is the food the old one
leads them to gather when wild in the woods. To make the&s;e go the farther,
they are to be chop|ped up with curds or other meat; and the young ones are to
be fed with great exactne&s;s, both as to the quantity and the time of their
&s;upply. This food is &s;ometimes al&s;o to be varied, and wood-lice, ear
wigs, and other in&s;ects, are to make a variety. The place where they are
reared mu&s;t be kept extremely clean; their water mu&s;t be changed twice or
thrice a day; they mu&s;t not be expo&s;ed till the dew is off the ground in
the morning; and they &s;hould always be taken in before &s;un-&s;et. When they
be|come adult, they very well can &s;hift for them|&s;elves, but they are
particularly fond of oats and barley.</P>
<P>In order to encrea&s;e the breed, and make it &s;till more
valuable, Longolius teaches us a me|thod that appears very peculiar. The
phea&s;ant is a very bold bird when fir&s;t brought into the yard among other
poultry, not &s;paring the pea|cock, nor even &s;uch young cocks and hens as it
can ma&s;ter; but after a time it will live tamely among them, and will at
la&s;t be brought to couple with a common hen. The breed thus produced take
much &s;tronger after the phea&s;ant than the hen; and in a few
&s;ucce&s;&s;ions, if they <PB N="190" REF="213"> be let to breed with the
cock-phea&s;ant, for the mixture is not barren, there will be produced a
&s;pecies more tame, &s;tronger, and more prolific; &s;o that he adds, that it
is &s;trange why mo&s;t of our phea&s;andries are not &s;tocked with birds
produced in this manner.</P>
<P>The phea&s;ant, when full grown, &s;eems to feed indifferently
upon every thing that offers. It is &s;aid by a French writer, that one of the
king's &s;port&s;men &s;hooting at a parcel of crows, that were gathered round
a dead car|ca&s;e, to his great &s;urprize upon coming up, found that he had
killed as many phea&s;ants as crows. It is even a&s;&s;erted by &s;ome, that
&s;uch is the carnivorous di&s;po&s;ition of this bird, that when &s;everal of
them are put together in the &s;ame yard, if one of them happens to fall
&s;ick, or &s;eems to be pining, that all the re&s;t will fall upon, kill, and
devour it. Such is the lan|guage of books; tho&s;e who have frequent
op|portunities of examining the manners of the bird it&s;elf, know what credit
ought to be given to &s;uch an account.</P>
<P>Of the phea&s;ant, as of all other dome&s;tic fowl, there are
many varieties. There are white phea&s;ants, cre&s;ted phea&s;ants, &s;potted
phea&s;ants; but of all others, the golden phea&s;ant of China is the mo&s;t
beautiful. It is a doubt whether the <PB N="191" REF="214"> peacock it&s;elf
can bear the compari&s;on. However, the natives of China would not have us
con&s;ider it as their mo&s;t beautiful bird, though all co|vered over with
eyes, re&s;embling in miniature tho&s;e of a peacock. By their accounts, it is
far exceeded by the fongwhang, an imaginary bird, of which they give a mo&s;t
phanta&s;tic de|&s;cription. It is thus that the people of every country,
though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the greate&s;t ad|vantages, have &s;till others
that they would per&s;uade &s;trangers they enjoy, which have ex|i&s;tence only
in the imagination.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. The Pintada or Guinea-Hen.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is a very remarkable bird, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure unites
the characteri&s;tics of the phea|&s;ant and the turkey. It has the fine
delicate &s;hape of the one, and the bare head of the other. To be more
particular, it is about the &s;ize of a common hen; but as it is &s;upported on
longer legs it looks much larger. It has a round back, with a tail turned
downwards like a partridge. The head is covered with a kind of ca&s;que; and
the whole plumage is black or dark grey, &s;peckled with white &s;pots. It has
wattles under the bill, which do not proceed from the lower chap as in cocks,
but from the upper, which gives it a very peculiar air, while its re&s;tle&s;s
gait and odd chuckling &s;ound di&s;tingui&s;h it &s;ufficiently from all other
birds whatever.</P>
<P>It is well known all over Europe, and even better than with us,
as the nations that border on the Mediterranean probably had it before us from
tho&s;e parts of Africa which lay neare&s;t. Accordingly we find it in
different countries called by different names, from the place whence they had
it. They are by <PB N="193" REF="216"> &s;ome called the Barbary-hen; by
others, the Tamis bird; and by others, the bird of Nu|midia. We have given it
the name of that part of Africa from whence probably it was fir&s;t
brought.</P>
<P>In many parts of their native country, they are &s;een in va&s;t
flocks together, feeding their young, and leading them in que&s;t of food. All
their habits are like tho&s;e of the poultry-kind, and they agree in every
other re&s;pect, except that the male and female are &s;o much alike, that they
can hardly be di&s;tingui&s;hed a&s;un|der. The only difference lies in the
wattles de&s;cribed above, which in the cock are of a bluei&s;h ca&s;t; in the
hen, they are more inclining to a red. Their eggs, like their bodies, are
&s;peckled; in our climate, they lay but five or &s;ix in a &s;ea&s;on; but
they are far more prolific in their &s;ultry regions at home. They are kept
among us rather for &s;hew than u&s;e, as their fle&s;h is not much e&s;teemed,
and as they give a good deal of trouble in the rearing.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. The Bu&s;tard.</HEAD>
<P>THE Bu&s;tard is the large&s;t land-bird that is a native of
Britain. It was once much more nu|merous than it is at pre&s;ent; but the
encrea&s;ed cultivation of the country, and the extreme delicacy of its
fle&s;h, has greatly thinned the &s;pecies; &s;o that a time may come when it
may be doubted whether ever &s;o large a bird was bred among us. It is probable
that long before this the bu&s;tard would have been extirpated, but for its
peculiar manner of feeding. Had it continued to &s;eek &s;helter among our
woods, in proportion as they were cut down, it mu&s;t have been de&s;troyed. If
in the fore&s;t, the fowler might approach it without being &s;een; and the
bird, from its &s;ize, would be too great a mark to be ea&s;ily mi&s;&s;ed. But
it inhabits only the open and exten&s;ive plain, where its food lies in
abundance, and where every invader may be &s;een at a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>The bu&s;tard is much larger than the turkey, the male generally
weighing from twenty-five to twenty &s;even pounds. The neck is a foot long,
and the legs a foot and a half. The <PB N="195" REF="218"> wings are not
proportionable to the re&s;t of the body, being but four feet from the tip of
one to the other; for which rea&s;on the bird flies with great difficulty. The
head and neck of the male are a&s;h-coloured; the back is barred
tran&s;ver&s;ely with black, bright, and ru&s;t colour. The greater quill
feathers are black; the belly white; and the tail, which con&s;i&s;ts of twenty
feathers, is marked with broad black bars.</P>
<P>It would &s;eem odd, as was hinted before, how &s;o large a
land-bird as this could find &s;helter in &s;o cultivated a country as England;
but the wonder will cea&s;e when we find it only in the mo&s;t open countries,
where there is &s;carce any approaching without being di&s;|covered. They are
frequently &s;een in flocks of fifty or more, in the exten&s;ive downs of
Sa|li&s;bury Plain, in the heaths of Suffex and Cam|bridge&s;hire, the
Dor&s;et&s;hire uplands, and &s;o on as far as Ea&s;t Lothian in Scotland. In
tho&s;e exten&s;ive plains, where there are no woods to &s;creen the
&s;port&s;man, nor hedges to creep along, the bu&s;tards enjoy an indolent
&s;ecurity. Their food is compo&s;ed of the berries that grow among the heath,
and the large earth-worms that appear in great quantities on the downs before
&s;un-ri&s;ing in &s;ummer. It is in vain that the fowler creeps forward to
approach them, <PB N="196" REF="219"> they have always centinels placed at
proper eminences, which are ever on the watch, and warn the flock of the
&s;malle&s;t appearance of danger. All therefore that is left the
&s;port&s;|man, is the comfortle&s;s view of their di&s;tant &s;ecurity. He may
wi&s;h, but they are in &s;afety.</P>
<P>It &s;ometimes happens that the&s;e birds, though they are
&s;eldom &s;hot by the gun, are often run down by grey-hounds. As they are
voracious and greedy, they often &s;acrifice their &s;afety to their appetite,
and feed them&s;elves &s;o very fat, that they are unable to fly without great
preparation. When the grey-hound, therefore, comes within a certain di&s;tance,
the bu&s;tard runs off flapping its wings, and endeavouring to gather air
enough under them to ri&s;e; in the mean time, the enemy approaches nearer and
nearer, till it is too late for the bird even to think of obtaining &s;afety by
flight; for ju&s;t at the ri&s;e there is always time lo&s;t, and of this the
bird is &s;en&s;ible; it continues, therefore, on the foot until it has got a
&s;ufficient way before the dog for flight, or until it is taken.</P>
<P>As there are few places where they can at once find proper food
and &s;ecurity, &s;o they ge|nerally continue near their old haunts, &s;eldom
wandering above twenty or thirty miles from home. As their food is replete with
moi&s;ture, <PB N="197" REF="220"> it enables them to live upon the&s;e dry
plains, where there are &s;carcely any &s;prings of water, a long time without
drinking. Be&s;ides this, Nature has given the males an admirable ma|gazine for
their &s;ecurity again&s;t thir&s;t. This is a pouch, the entrance of which
lies im|mediately under the tongue, and capable of holding near &s;even quarts
of water. This is probably filled upon proper occa&s;ions, to &s;upply the hen
when &s;itting, or the young before they can fly.</P>
<P>Like all other birds of the poultry-kind, they change their
mates at the &s;ea&s;on of incubation, which is about the latter end of
&s;ummer. They &s;eparate in pairs if there be a &s;ufficiency of fe|males for
the males; but when this happens to be otherwi&s;e, the males fight until one
of them falls. In France, they often find &s;ome of tho&s;e victims to
gallantry dead in the fields, and no doubt are not di&s;plea&s;ed at the
occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>They make their ne&s;ts upon the ground, only ju&s;t &s;craping
a hole in the earth, and &s;ome|times lining it with a little long gra&s;s or
&s;traw. There they lay two eggs only, almo&s;t of the &s;ize of a goo&s;e egg,
of a pale olive brown, marked with &s;pots of a darker colour. They hatch for
about five weeks, and the young ones run about as &s;oon as they are out of the
&s;hell.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="221">The bu&s;tards a&s;&s;emble in flocks in
the month of October, and keep together till April. In winter, as their food
becomes more &s;carce, they &s;upport them&s;elves indi&s;criminately, by
feeding on moles, mice, and even little birds, when they can &s;eize them. For
want of other food, they are contented to live upon turnep leaves and &s;uch
like &s;ucculent vegetables. In &s;ome parts of Switzerland, they are found
frozen in the fields in &s;evere weather; but when taken to a warm place they
again recover. They u&s;ually live fifteen years, and are incapable of being
propagated in a dome&s;tic &s;tate, as they probably want that food which
be&s;t agrees with their appetite.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. The Grous and its Affinities.</HEAD>
<P>THE Cock of the Wood, the Black Cock, the Grous, and the
Ptarmigan&mdash;The&s;e are all birds of a &s;imilar nature, and chiefly found
in heathy mountains and piny fore&s;ts, at a di&s;tance from mankind. They
might once indeed have been common enough all over England, when a great part
of the country was covered with heath; but at pre&s;ent their numbers are
thinned: the two fir&s;t of this kind are utterly unknown in the &s;outh, and
have taken refuge in the northern parts of Scotland, where the exten&s;ive
heaths afford them &s;ecurity, and the fore&s;ts &s;helter.</P>
<P>The cock of the wood is &s;ometimes of the &s;ize of a turkey,
and often weighs near four|teen pounds; the black cock, of which the male is
all over black, though the female is of the colour of a partridge, is about the
&s;ize of a hen, and, like the former, is only found with us in the highlands
of Scotland; the grous is about half as large again as a partridge, and its
colour much like that of a wood-cock, but redder; the ptarmigan is &s;till
&s;omewhat le&s;s, <PB N="200" REF="223"> and is of a pale brown or
a&s;h-colour. They are all di&s;tingui&s;hable from other birds of the poultry
kind, by a naked &s;kin, of a &s;carlet colour, above the eyes, in the place
and of the figure of eye-brows.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to be &s;omething extraordinary, that all the larger
wild animals of every &s;pecies chu&s;e the darke&s;t and the inmo&s;t
rece&s;&s;es of the woods for their re&s;idence, while the &s;maller kinds come
more into the open and cultivated parts, where there is more food and more
danger. It is thus with the birds I am de&s;cribing: while the cock of the wood
is &s;eldom &s;een, except on the inacce&s;&s;ible parts of heathy mountains,
or in the mid&s;t of piny fore&s;ts, the grous is found, in great numbers, in
the neighbourhood of corn|fields, where there is heath to afford retreat and
&s;helter. Their food too &s;omewhat differs; while the &s;maller kind lives
upon heath blo&s;&s;oms, cranberries, and corn, the larger feeds upon the cones
of the pine-tree; and will &s;ometimes entirely &s;trip one tree, before it
offers to touch tho&s;e of another, though ju&s;t be&s;ide him. In other
re&s;pects, the manners of the&s;e birds are the &s;ame; being both equally
&s;imple in their diet, and licentious in their amours.</P>
<P>The Cock of the Wood, for it is from him we will take our
de&s;cription, is, as was &s;aid, <PB N="201" REF="224"> chiefly fond of a
mountainous and wooded &s;ituation. In winter he re&s;ides in the darke&s;t and
inmo&s;t part of the woods; in &s;ummer he ventures down from his retreats, to
make &s;hort depredations on the farmer's corn. The deli|cacy of his fle&s;h in
&s;ome mea&s;ure &s;ets a high price upon his head; and as he is greatly
&s;ought after, &s;o he continues, when he comes down from the hills, always on
his guard. Upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, he is &s;eldom &s;urprized; and tho&s;e
who would take him, mu&s;t venture up to find him in his native retreats.</P>
<P>The cock of the wood, when in the fore&s;t, attaches him&s;elf
principally to the oak and the pine-tree; the cones of the latter &s;erving for
his food, and the thick boughs for an habitation. He even makes a choice of
what cones he &s;hall feed upon; for he &s;ometimes will &s;trip one tree bare
before he will deign to touch the cones of another. He feeds al&s;o upon ant's
eggs, which &s;eem a high delicacy to all birds of the poultry kind:
cranberries are likewi&s;e often found in his crop; and his gizzard, like that
of dome&s;tic fowls, contains a quantity of gravel, for the purpo&s;es of
a&s;&s;i&s;ting his powers of dige&s;tion.</P>
<P>At the earlie&s;t return of &s;pring, this bird begins to feel
the genial influence of the &s;ea&s;on. During the month of March, the
approaches <PB N="202" REF="225"> of court&s;hip are continued, and do not
de&s;i&s;t till the trees have all their leaves, and the fore&s;t is in full
bloom. During this whole &s;ea&s;on, the cock of the wood is &s;een at
&s;un-ri&s;e, and &s;etting extremely active upon one of the large&s;t branches
of the pine-tree. With his tail rai&s;ed and expanded like a fan, and the wings
drooping, he is &s;een walking backward and forward, his neck &s;tretched out,
his head &s;wolen and red, and making a thou&s;and ridiculous po&s;tures: his
cry, upon that occa&s;ion, is a kind of loud explo&s;ion, which is in&s;tantly
followed by a noi&s;e like the whetting of a &s;cythe, which cea&s;es and
commences alternatively for about an hour, and is then terminated by the &s;ame
explo&s;ion.</P>
<P>During the time this &s;ingular cry continues, the bird &s;eems
entirely deaf, and in&s;en&s;ible of every danger: whatever noi&s;e may be made
near him, or even though fired at, he &s;till con|tinues his call; and this is
the time that &s;port&s;|men generally take to &s;hoot him. Upon all other
occa&s;ions, he is the mo&s;t timorous and watch|ful bird in nature: but now he
&s;eems entirely ab&s;orbed by his in&s;tincts; and &s;eldom leaves the place
where he fir&s;t begins to feel the acce&s;&s;es of de&s;ire. This
extraordinary cry, which is accompanied by a clapping of the wings, is no 
<PB N="203" REF="226"> &s;ooner fini&s;hed, than the female hearing it
re|plies, approaches, and places her&s;elf under the tree, from whence the cock
de&s;cends to im|pregnate her. The number of females that, on this occa&s;ion,
re&s;ort to his call, is uncertain; but one male generally &s;uffices for
all.</P>
<P>The female is much le&s;s than her mate, and entirely unlike him
in plumage, &s;o that &s;he might be mi&s;taken for a bird of another
&s;pecies: &s;he &s;eldom lays more than &s;ix or &s;even eggs, which are
white, and marked with yellow, of the &s;ize of a common hen's egg: &s;he
generally lays them in a dry place and a mo&s;&s;y ground, and hatches them
without the company of the cock. When &s;he is obliged, during the time of
incubation, to leave her eggs in que&s;t of food, &s;he covers them up &s;o
artfully, with mo&s;s or dry leaves, that it is extremely difficult to
di&s;cover them. On this occa&s;ion, &s;he is ex|tremely tame and tranquil,
however wild and timorous in ordinary. She often keeps to her ne&s;t, though
&s;trangers attempt to drag her away.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the young ones are hatched, they are &s;een running
with extreme agility after the mother, though &s;ometimes they are not entirely
di&s;engaged from the &s;hell. The hen leads them forward, for the fir&s;t
time, into the woods, <PB N="204" REF="227"> &s;hews them ant's eggs, and the
wild moun|tain-berries, which, while young, are their only food. As they grow
older, their appetites grow &s;tronger, and they then feed upon the tops of
hether and the cones of the pine-tree. In this manner they &s;oon come to
perfection: they are an hardy bird, their food lies every where before them,
and it would &s;eem that they &s;hould en|crea&s;e in great abundance. But this
is not the ca&s;e; their numbers are thinned by rapacious birds and bea&s;ts of
every kind; and &s;till more by their own &s;alacious conte&s;ts.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the clutching is over, which the female performs in
the manner of an hen, the whole brood follows the mother for about a month or
two; at the end of which the young males entirely for&s;ake her, and keep in
great harmony together till the beginning of &s;pring. At this &s;ea&s;on, they
begin, for the fir&s;t time, to feel the genial acce&s;s; and then adieu to all
their former friend&s;hips! They begin to con|&s;ider each other as rivals; and
the rage of con|cupi&s;cence quite extingui&s;hes the &s;pirit of &s;o|ciety.
They fight each other, like game cocks; and at that time are &s;o inattentive
to their own &s;afety, that it often happens that two or three of them are
killed at a &s;hot. It is probable, <PB N="205" REF="228"> that in the&s;e
conte&s;ts, the bird which comes off victorious takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
female &s;era|glio, as it is certain they have no faithful at|tachments<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This account of the Cock of the Wood is taken from the

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. Of the Partridge and its Varieties.</HEAD>
<P>THE Partridge may be particularly con&s;i|dered as belonging to
the &s;port&s;man. It is a bird which even our laws have taken under
protection; and, like a peacock or a hen, may be ranked as a private property.
The only difference now is, that we feed one in our farms, the other in our
yards; that the&s;e are contented captives; tho&s;e, &s;ervants that have it in
their power to change their ma&s;ter, by changing their habitation.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"The&s;e birds," &s;ays Willoughby, "hold the
principal place in the fea&s;ts and entertainments of princes; without which
their fea&s;ts are e&s;teemed ignoble, vulgar, and of no account. The Frenchmen
do &s;o highly value, and are &s;o fond of the partridge, that if they be
wanting, they utterly &s;light and de&s;pi&s;e the be&s;t &s;pread tables; as
if there could be no fea&s;t without them."</Q> But however this might be in
the times of our hi&s;torian, the partridge is now too common in France to be
con&s;idered as a delicacy; and this, as well as every other &s;imple di&s;h,
is exploded for luxuries of a more compound invention.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="230">In England, where the partridge is much
&s;carcer, and a great deal dearer, it is &s;till a favourite delicacy at the
tables of the rich; and the de&s;ire of keeping it to them&s;elves, has
in|duced them to make laws for its pre&s;ervation, no way harmonizing with the
general &s;pirit of Engli&s;h legi&s;lation. What can be more arbi|trary than
to talk of pre&s;erving the game; which, when defined, means no more than that
the poor &s;hall ab&s;tain from what the rich have taken a fancy to keep for
them&s;elves? If the&s;e birds could, like a cock or a hen, be made legal
property, could they be taught to keep within certain di&s;tricts, and only
feed on tho&s;e grounds that belong to the man who&s;e enter|tainments they
improve, it then might, with &s;ome &s;hew of ju&s;tice, be admitted, that as a
man fed them &s;o he might claim them. But this is not the ca&s;e; nor is it in
any man's power to lay a re&s;traint upon the liberty of the&s;e birds, that,
when let loo&s;e, put no limits to their excur&s;ions. They feed every where;
upon every man's ground; and no man can &s;ay, the&s;e birds are fed only by
me. Tho&s;e birds which are nou|ri&s;hed by all, belong to all; nor can any one
man, or any &s;et of men, lay claim to them, when &s;till continuing in a
&s;tate of nature.</P>
<P>I never walked out about the environs of <PB N="208" REF="231">
Paris, that I did not con&s;ider the immen&s;e quantity of game that was
running almo&s;t tame on every &s;ide of me, as a badge of the &s;lavery of the
people; and what they wi&s;hed me to ob&s;erve as an object of triumph, I
always re|garded with a kind of &s;ecret compa&s;&s;ion: yet this people have
no game-laws for the remoter parts of the kingdom; the game is only
pre|&s;erved in a few places for the king; and is free in mo&s;t places el&s;e.
In England, the prohi|bition is general; and the pea&s;ant has not a right to
what even &s;laves, as he is taught to call them, are found to
po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>Of partridges there are two kinds; the grey and the red. The red
partridge is the large&s;t of the two, and often perches upon trees; the grey,
with which we are be&s;t acquainted in England, is mo&s;t prolific, and always
keeps on the ground.</P>
<P>The partridge &s;eems to be a bird well known all over the
world, as it is found in every country, and in every climate; as well in the
frozen regions about the pole, as the torrid tracts under the equator. It even
&s;eems to adapt it&s;elf to the nature of the climate where it re&s;ides. In
Greenland, the partridge, which is brown in &s;ummer, as &s;oon as the icy
winter &s;ets in, begins to take a covering &s;uited to the 
<PB N="209" REF="232"> &s;ea&s;on: it is then cloathed with a warm down
beneath; and its outward plumage a&s;&s;umes the colour of the &s;nows
among&s;t which it &s;eeks its food. Thus it is doubly fitted for the place, by
the warmth and the colour of its plumage; the one to defend it from the cold,
the other to prevent its being noticed by the enemy. Tho&s;e of Barakonda, on
the other hand, are longer legged, much &s;wifter of foot, and chu&s;e the
highe&s;t rocks and precipices to re&s;ide in.</P>
<P>They all, however, agree in one character, of being immoderately
addicted to venery; and, as &s;ome writers affirm, often to an unnatural
degree. It is certain, the male will pur&s;ue the hen even to her ne&s;t; and
will break, her eggs, rather than not indulge his inclinations. Though the
young ones have kept together in flocks during the winter, when they begin to
pair in &s;pring, their &s;ociety di&s;per&s;es; and combats, very terrible
with re&s;pect to each other, en&s;ue. Their manners, in other circum&s;tances,
re|&s;emble all tho&s;e of poultry in general; but their cunning and
in&s;tincts &s;eem &s;uperior to tho&s;e of the larger kinds. Perhaps, as they
live in the very neighbourhood of their enemies, they have more frequent
occa&s;ion to put their little arts in practice; and learn, by habit, the means
of <PB N="210" REF="233"> eva&s;ion or &s;afety. Whenever, therefore, a dog or
other formidable animal approaches their ne&s;t, the female u&s;es every means
to draw him away. She keeps ju&s;t before him, pretends to be incapable of
flying, ju&s;t hops up and then falls down before him, but never goes off &s;o
far as to di&s;courage her pur&s;uer. At length, when &s;he has drawn him
entirely away from her &s;ecret trea&s;ure, &s;he at once takes wing, and
fairly leaves him to gaze after her in de&s;pair.</P>
<P>After the danger is over, and the dog with|drawn, &s;he then
calls her young, who a&s;&s;emble at once at her cry, and follow where &s;he
leads them. There are generally from ten to fifteen in a covey; and, if
unmole&s;ted, they live from fifteen to &s;eventeen years.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal methods of taking them, as is well known;
that by which they are taken in a net, with a &s;etting dog, is the mo&s;t
plea&s;ant, as well as the mo&s;t &s;ecure. The dog, as every body knows, is
trained to this exerci&s;e, by a long cour&s;e of education: by blows and
care&s;&s;es he is taught to lie down at the word of command; a partridge is
&s;hewn him, and he is then ordered to lie down; he is brought into the field,
and when the &s;port&s;man perceives where the covey lies, he orders his dog to
crouch: at length the <PB N="211" REF="234"> dog, from habit, crouches wherever
he ap|proaches a covey; and this is the &s;ignal which the &s;port&s;man
receives for unfolding and co|vering the birds with his net. A covey thus
caught, is &s;ometimes fed in a place proper for their reception; but they can
never be tho|roughly tamed, like the re&s;t of our dome&s;tic poultry.</P>

<PB N="212" REF="235">
<HEAD>CHAP. X. The Quail.</HEAD>
<P>THE la&s;t of the poultry kind that I &s;hall mention is the
Quail; a bird much &s;maller than any of the former, being not above half the
&s;ize of a partridge. The feathers of the head are black, edged with ru&s;ty
brown; the brea&s;t is of a pale yellowi&s;h red, &s;potted with black; the
feathers on the back are marked with lines of pale yellow, and the legs are of
a pale hue. Except in the colours thus de&s;cribed, and the &s;ize, it every
way re&s;embles a partridge in &s;hape; and, except that it is a bird of
pa&s;&s;age, all others of the poultry kind, in its habits and nature.</P>
<P>The quail is by all known to be a bird of pa&s;&s;age; and yet
if we con&s;ider its heavy man|ner of flying, and its dearth of plumage, with
re&s;pect to its corpulence, we &s;hall be &s;urprized how a bird &s;o
apparently ill qualified for mi|gration, &s;hould take &s;uch exten&s;ive
journeys. Nothing however is more certain: 
<Q REND="inline">"When we &s;ailed from Rhodes to Alexandria,"
&s;ays Bel|lonius, "about autumn, many quails, flying from the north to the
&s;outh, were taken in our &s;hip; and &s;ailing at &s;pring-time the contrary 
<PB N="213" REF="236"> way, from the &s;outh to the north, I ob&s;erved them on
their return, when many of them were taken in the &s;ame manner."</Q> This
ac|count is confirmed by many others; who aver, that they chu&s;e a north wind
for the&s;e adven|tures; the &s;outh wind being very unfavourable, as it
retards their flight, by moi&s;tening their plumage. They then fly two by two;
con|tinuing, when their way lies over land, to go fa&s;ter by night than by
day; and to fly very high, to avoid being &s;urprized or &s;et upon by birds of
prey. However, it &s;till remains a doubt whether quails take &s;uch long
journies as Bel|lonius has made them perform. It is now a&s;&s;erted by &s;ome,
that the quail only migrates from one province of a country to another. For
in&s;tance, in England, they fly from the inland counties, to tho&s;e bordering
on the &s;ea, and continue there all the winter. If fro&s;t or &s;now drive
them out of the &s;tubble fields or mar&s;hes, they then retreat to the &s;ea
&s;ide, &s;helter them&s;elves among the weeds, and live upon what is thrown up
from the &s;ea upon &s;hore. Particularly in E&s;&s;ex, the time of their
appearance upon the coa&s;ts of that country exactly coincides with their
di&s;appearance from the more internal parts of the kingdom; &s;o 
<PB N="214" REF="237"> that what has been &s;aid of their long flights, is
probably not &s;o well founded as is generally &s;uppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds are much le&s;s prolific than the partridge;
&s;eldom laying more than &s;ix or &s;even whiti&s;h eggs, marked with ragged,
ru&s;t coloured &s;pots. But their ardour in court&s;hip yields &s;carce to any
other bird, as they are fierce and cruel at that &s;ea&s;on to each other,
fighting mo&s;t de&s;perately, and (a puni&s;hment they richly de|&s;erve)
being at that time very ea&s;ily taken. Quail-fighting was a favourite
amu&s;ement among the Athenians: they ab&s;tained from the fle&s;h of this
bird, deeming it unwhole&s;ome, as &s;uppo&s;ing that it fed upon the white
hellebore; but they reared great numbers of them, for the plea&s;ure of
&s;eeing them fight; and &s;taked &s;ums of money, as we do with regard to
cocks, upon the &s;ucce&s;s of the combat. Fa&s;hion, however, has at pre&s;ent
changed with regard to this bird; we take no plea&s;ure in its courage, but its
fle&s;h is con&s;idered as a very great delicacy.</P>
<P>Quails are ea&s;ily caught by a call: the fowler, early in the
morning, having &s;pread his net, hides him&s;elf under it, among the corn; he
then imitates the voice of the female, with his quail-pipe, which the cock
hearing, approaches with the utmo&s;t a&s;&s;iduity; when he has got under 
<PB N="215" REF="238"> the net, the fowler then di&s;covers him&s;elf, and
terrifies the quail, who attempting to get away, entangles him&s;elf the more
in the net, and is taken. The quail may thus very well &s;erve to illu&s;trate
the old adage, that every pa&s;&s;ion, carried to an inordinate exce&s;s, will
at la&s;t lead to ruin.</P>

<HEAD>PART III. OF BIRDS OF THE PIE KIND.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<PB N="219" REF="240">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. Birds of the Pie Kind.</HEAD>
<P>IN mar&s;halling our army of the feathered creation, we have
placed in the van a race of birds long bred to war, and who&s;e pa&s;&s;ion is
&s;laughter; in the center we have placed the &s;low and heavy laden, that are
u&s;ually brought into the field to be de&s;troyed; we now come to a kind of
light infantry, that partake &s;ome|thing of the &s;pirit of the two former,
and yet belonging to neither. In this cla&s;s we mu&s;t be content to mar&s;hal
a numerous irregular tribe, va|riou&s;ly armed, with different pur&s;uits,
appetites, and manners; not formidably formed for war, and yet generally
delighting in mi&s;chief; not &s;lowly and u&s;efully obedient, and yet without
any profe&s;&s;ed enmity to the re&s;t of their fellow tenants of air.</P>
<P>To &s;peak without metaphor, under this cla&s;s of birds we may
arrange all that noi&s;y, re&s;tle&s;s, chattering, teizing tribe that lies
between the hen and the thru&s;h, that, from the &s;ize of the raven down to
that of the wood-pecker, flutter round our habitations and, rather with the
&s;pirit <PB N="220" REF="241"> of pilferers than of robbers, make free with
the fruits of human indu&s;try.</P>
<P>Of all the other cla&s;&s;es, this &s;eems to be that which the
lea&s;t contributes to furni&s;h out the plea&s;ures or &s;upply the
nece&s;&s;ities of man. The falcon hunts for him; the poultry tribe &s;upplies
him with luxurious food; and the little &s;parrow race delight him with the
melody of their warblings. The crane kind make a &s;tudied variety in his
entertainments; and the cla&s;s of ducks are not only many of them delicate in
their fle&s;h, but extremely u&s;eful for their feathers. But in the cla&s;s of
the pie kind there are few except the pidgeon that are any way u&s;eful. They
&s;erve rather to teize man than to a&s;&s;i&s;t or amu&s;e him. Like
faithle&s;s &s;ervants, they are fond of his neighbourhood, becau&s;e they
mo&s;tly live by his labour; but their chief &s;tudy is what they can plunder
in his ab&s;ence, while their deaths make him no atonement for their
depredation.</P>
<P>But though, with re&s;pect to man, this whole cla&s;s is rather
noxious than beneficial; though he may con&s;ider them in this light, as
fal&s;e, noi&s;y, trouble&s;ome neighbours, yet, with re|&s;pect to each other,
no cla&s;s of birds are &s;o in|genious, &s;o active, or &s;o well fitted for
&s;ociety. Could we &s;uppo&s;e a kind of morality among <PB N="221" REF="242">
birds, we &s;hould find that the&s;e are by far the mo&s;t indu&s;trious, the
mo&s;t faithful, the mo&s;t con&s;tant, and the mo&s;t connubial. The rapacious
kinds drive out their young before they are fit to &s;truggle with adver&s;ity;
but the pie kind cheri&s;h their young to the la&s;t. The poultry cla&s;s are
faithle&s;s and promi&s;cuous in their court&s;hip; but the&s;e live in pairs,
and their attachments are wholly confined to each other. The &s;parrow kind
frequently overleap the bounds of Nature and make illicit varieties; but
the&s;e never. They live in harmony with each other; every &s;pecies is true to
its kind, and tran&s;mits an unpolluted race to po&s;terity.</P>
<P>As other kinds build in rocks or upon the ground, the chief
place where the&s;e build is in trees or bu&s;hes; the male takes his &s;hare
in the labours of building the ne&s;t; and often relieves his mate in the
duties of incubation. Both take this office by turns; and when the young are
excluded, both are equally active in making them an ample provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>They &s;ometimes live in &s;ocieties; and in the&s;e there are
general laws ob&s;erved, and a kind of republican form of government
e&s;tabli&s;hed among them. They watch not only for the general &s;afety, but
for that of every other bird of the grove. How often have we &s;een a fowler, 
<PB N="222" REF="243"> &s;tealing in upon a flock of ducks or wild gee&s;e,
di&s;turbed by the alarming note of a crow or a magpie: its &s;ingle voice gave
the whole thought|le&s;s tribe warning, and taught them in good time to look to
their &s;afety.</P>
<P>Nor are the&s;e birds le&s;s remarkable for their in&s;tincts
than their capacity for in&s;truction. There is an apparent cunning or
archne&s;s in the look of the whole tribe; and I have &s;een crows and ravens
taught to fetch and carry with the docility of a &s;paniel. Indeed, it is often
an exerci&s;e that without teaching all this tribe are but too fond of. Every
body knows what a pa&s;&s;ion they have for &s;hining &s;ub&s;tances and &s;uch
toys as &s;ome of us put a value upon. A whole family has been alarmed at the
lo&s;s of a ring; every &s;ervant has been accu&s;ed, and every creature in the
hou&s;e, con&s;cious of their own in|nocence, &s;u&s;pected each other, when,
to the utter &s;urprize of all, it has been found in the ne&s;t of a tame
magpie or a jack-daw that no|body had ever thought of.</P>
<P>However, as this cla&s;s is very numerous, it is not to be
&s;uppo&s;ed that the manners are alike in all. Some, &s;uch as the pidgeon,
are gentle and &s;erviceable to man; others are noxious, capricious, and
noi&s;y. In a few ge|neral characters they all agree; namely, in 
<PB N="223" REF="244"> having hoar&s;e voices, &s;light active bodies, and a
facility of flight, that baffles even the bolde&s;t of the rapacious kinds in
the pur&s;uit. I will begin with tho&s;e birds which mo&s;t properly may be
&s;aid to belong to this cla&s;s, and go on till I fini&s;h with the pidgeon,
an harmle&s;s bird, that re&s;embles this tribe in little el&s;e except their
&s;ize, and that &s;eems to be the &s;hade uniting the pie and the &s;parrow
kind into one general picture.</P>
<P>It is not to be expected that in this &s;ketch of the great
magazine of Nature we can &s;top &s;ingly to contemplate every object. To
de&s;cribe the number that offers would be tedious, and the &s;imilitude that
one bears another would make the hi&s;tory di&s;gu&s;ting. As an hi&s;torian in
re|lating the actions of &s;ome noble people does not &s;top to give the
character of every private man in the army, but only of &s;uch as have been
di|&s;tingui&s;hed by their conduct, courage, or treachery; &s;o &s;hould the
hi&s;torian of Nature only &s;eize upon the mo&s;t &s;triking objects before
him; and, having given one common account of the mo&s;t remarkable, refer the
peculiarities of the re&s;t to their general de&s;cription.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="224" REF="245">
<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the Raven, the Crow, and their
Affinities.</HEAD>
<P>THE raven, the carrion-crow, and the rook, are birds &s;o well
known, that a long de&s;cription would but ob&s;cure our ideas of them. The
raven is the large&s;t of the three, and di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from the re&s;t not
only by his &s;ize, but by his bill being &s;omewhat more hooked than that of
the re&s;t. As for the carrion-crow and the rook, they &s;o &s;trongly
re&s;emble each other, both in make and &s;ize, that they are not ea&s;ily
di&s;tingui&s;hed a&s;under. The chief difference to be found between them lies
in the bill of the rook; which, by frequently being thru&s;t into the ground to
fetch out grubs and earth-worms, is bare of feathers as far as the eyes, and
appears of a whiti&s;h colour. It differs al&s;o in the purple &s;plendour or
glo&s;s of its feathers, which in the carrion-crow are of a more dirty black.
Nor is it ami&s;s to make the&s;e di&s;tinctions, as the rook has but too
frequently &s;uffered for its &s;imi|tude to the carrion-crow; and thus an
harmle&s;s bird, that feeds only upon in&s;ects and corn, has been de&s;troyed
for another that feeds upon car|rion, and is often de&s;tructive among young
poultry.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="246">The manners of the raven and the
carrion-crow are exactly &s;imilar; they both feed upon carrion; they fly only
in pairs; and will de&s;troy other birds if they can take them by &s;urprize.
But it is very different with the rook, the daw, and the Corni&s;h chough,
which may be all ranked in this order. They are &s;ociable and harmle&s;s; they
live only upon in&s;ects and grain; and wherever they are, in&s;tead of
injuring other birds, they &s;eem centinels for the whole feathered creation.
It will be proper, therefore, to de&s;cribe the&s;e two &s;orts according to
their re|&s;pective appetites, as they have nothing in com|mon but the very
&s;trong &s;imilitude they bear to each other in their colour and
formation.</P>
<P>The raven is a bird found in every region of the world: &s;trong
and hardy, he is uninfluenced by the changes of the weather; and when other
birds &s;eem numbed with cold, or pining with famine, the raven is active and
healthy, bu&s;ily employed in prowling for prey, or &s;porting in the colde&s;t
atmo&s;phere. As the heats at the line do not oppre&s;s him, &s;o he bears the
cold of the polar countries with equal indifference. He is &s;ometimes indeed
&s;een milk white; and this may probably be the effect of the rigorous
cli|mates of the north. It is mo&s;t likely that this change is wrought upon
him as upon mo&s;t other <PB N="226" REF="247"> animals in that part of the
world, where their robes, particularly in winter, a&s;&s;ume the colour of the
country they inhabit. As in old age, when the natural heat decays, the hair
grows grey, and at la&s;t white, &s;o among the&s;e animals the cold of the
climate may produce a &s;imilar langui&s;hment of colour, and may &s;hut up
tho&s;e pores that conveyed the tincturing fluids to the extreme&s;t parts of
the body.</P>
<P>However this may be, white ravens are often &s;hown among us,
which, I have heard &s;ome &s;ay, are rendered thus by art; and this we could
rea|dily &s;uppo&s;e if they were as ea&s;ily changed in their colour as they
are altered in their habits and di&s;po&s;itions. A raven may be reclaimed to
al|mo&s;t every purpo&s;e to which birds can be con|verted. He may be trained
up for fowling like an hawk; he may be taught to fetch and carry like a
&s;paniel; he may be taught to &s;peak like a parrot; but the mo&s;t
extraordinary of all is, that he can be taught to &s;ing like a man. I have
heard a raven &s;ing the Black Joke with great di&s;tinctne&s;s, truth, and
humour.</P>
<P>Indeed, when the raven is taken as a dome&s;tic, he has many
qualities that render him extremely amu&s;ing. Bu&s;y, inqui&s;itive, and
impudent, he goes every where, affronts and drives off the dogs, plays his
pranks on the poultry, and is <PB N="227" REF="248"> particularly a&s;&s;iduous
in cultivating the good will of the cook-maid, who &s;eems to be the fa|vourite
of the family. But then, with the amu&s;|ing qualities of a favourite, he often
al&s;o has the vices and defects. He is a glutton by nature, and a thief by
habit. He does not confine him|&s;elf to petty depredations on the pantry or
the larder; he &s;oars at more magnificent plunder; at &s;poils that he can
neither exhibit nor enjoy; but which, like a mi&s;er, he re&s;ts &s;atisfied
with having the &s;atisfaction of &s;ometimes vi&s;iting and contemplating in
&s;ecret. A piece of money, a tea-&s;poon, or a ring, are always tempting baits
to his avarice; the&s;e he will &s;lily &s;eize upon, and if not watched will
carry to his favourite hole.</P>
<P>In his wild &s;tate, the raven is an active and greedy
plunderer. Nothing comes ami&s;s to him; whether his prey be living or long
dead it is all the &s;ame, he falls to with a voracious appe|tite; and when he
has gorged him&s;elf, flies to acquaint his fellows that they may participate
of the &s;poil. If the carca&s;e be already in the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of
&s;ome more powerful animal, a wolf, a fox, or a dog, the raven &s;its at a
little di&s;tance, content to continue an humble &s;pectator till they have
done. If in his flights he perceives no hopes of carrion, and his &s;cent is
&s;o exqui&s;ite <PB N="228" REF="249"> that he can &s;mell it at a va&s;t
di&s;tance, he then contents him&s;elf with more un&s;avory food, fruits,
in&s;ects, and the accidental de&s;ert of a dunghill.</P>
<P>This bird chiefly builds its ne&s;t in trees, and lays five or
&s;ix eggs of a pale green colour, marked with &s;mall browni&s;h &s;pots. They
live &s;ometimes in pairs, and &s;ometimes they fre|quent in great numbers the
neighbourhood of populous cities, where they are u&s;eful in de|vouring tho&s;e
carca&s;es that would otherwi&s;e pu|trefy and infect the air. They build in
high trees or old towers, in the beginning of March with us in England, and
&s;ometimes &s;ooner, as the &s;pring is more or le&s;s advanced for the
&s;ea&s;on. But it is not always near towns that they fix their retreats: they
often build in un|frequented places, and drive all other birds from their
vicinity. They will not permit even their young to keep in the &s;ame
di&s;trict, but drive them off when they are &s;ufficiently able to &s;hift for
them&s;elves. Martin, in his de&s;cription of the We&s;tern I&s;les, avers,
that there are three little i&s;lands among the number which are oc|cupied by a
pair of ravens each, that drive off all other birds with great cries and
impetuo&s;ity.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the injury the&s;e birds do in picking out the
eyes of &s;heep and lambs, when <PB N="229" REF="250"> they find them &s;ick
and helple&s;s, a vulgar re|&s;pect is paid them as being the birds that fed
the prophet Elijah in the wilderne&s;s. This prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in favour of
the raven is of very ancient date, as the Romans them&s;elves, who thought the
bird ominous, paid it from motives of fear the mo&s;t profound veneration. One
of the&s;e that had been kept in the temple of Ca&s;tor, as Pliny informs us,
flew down into the &s;hop of a taylor, who took much delight in the vi&s;its of
his new acquaintance. He taught the bird &s;e|veral tricks; but particularly to
pronounce the names of the emperor Tiberius and the whole royal family. The
taylor was beginning to grow rich by tho&s;e who came to &s;ee this won|derful
raven, till an envious neighbour, di&s;|plea&s;ed at the taylor's &s;ucce&s;s,
killed the bird, and deprived the taylor of his future hopes of fortune. The
Romans, however, took the poor taylor's part; they puni&s;hed the man who
of|fered the injury, and gave the raven all the ho|nours of a magnificent
interment.</P>
<P>Birds in general live longer than quadru|pedes; and the raven is
&s;aid to be one of the mo&s;t long-lived of the number. He&s;iod a&s;&s;erts
that a raven will live nine times as long as a man; but though this is
fabulous, it is certain that &s;ome of them have been known to live near 
<PB N="230" REF="251"> an hundred years. This animal &s;eems po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of tho&s;e qualities that generally produce lon|gevity, a good appetite and
great exerci&s;e. In clear weather, the ravens fly in pairs to a great height,
making a deep loud noi&s;e, different from that of their u&s;ual croaking.</P>
<P>The carrion-crow re&s;embles the raven in its appetites, its
laying, and manner of bringing up its young. It only differs in being le&s;s
bold, le&s;s docile, and le&s;s favoured by mankind.</P>
<P>The rook leads the way in another, but a more harmle&s;s train,
that have no carnivorous appetites, but only feed upon in&s;ects and corn. The
roy&s;ton crow is about the &s;ize of the two former. The brea&s;t, belly,
back, and upper part of the neck, being of a pale a&s;h-colour; the head and
wings glo&s;&s;ed over with a fine blue. He is a bird of pa&s;&s;age,
vi&s;iting this kingdom in the beginning of winter and leaving it in the
&s;pring. He breeds, however, in different parts of the Briti&s;h dominions;
and his ne&s;t is com|mon enough in trees in Ireland. The jack-daw is black,
like all the former, but a&s;h-coloured on the brea&s;t and belly. He is not
above the &s;ize of a pigeon. He is docile and loquacious. His head being large
for the &s;ize of his body, which, as has been remarked, argues him in|genious
and crafty. He builds in &s;teeples, old <PB N="231" REF="252"> ca&s;tles, and
high rocks, laying five or &s;ix eggs in a &s;ea&s;on. The Corni&s;h chough is
like a jack-daw, but bigger, and almo&s;t the &s;ize of a crow. The feet and
legs are long like tho&s;e of a jack-daw, but of a red colour; and the plumage
is black all over. It frequents rocks, old ca&s;tles, and churches, by the
&s;ea-&s;ide, like the daw; and with the &s;ame noi&s;y a&s;&s;iduity. It is
only &s;een along the we&s;tern coa&s;ts of England. The&s;e are birds very
&s;imilar in their manners, feeding on grain and in&s;ects, living in
&s;ociety, and often &s;uffering general ca&s;tigation from the flock for the
good of the community.</P>
<P>The rook, as is well known, builds in woods and fore&s;ts in the
neighbourhood of man, and &s;ometimes makes choice of groves in the very
mid&s;t of cities for the place of its retreat and &s;e|curity. In the&s;e it
e&s;tabli&s;hes a kind of legal con&s;titution, by which all intruders are
excluded from coming to live among them, and none &s;uffered to build but
acknowledged natives of the place. I have often amu&s;ed my&s;elf with
ob|&s;erving their plan of policy from my window in the Temple, that looks upon
a grove where they have made a colony in the mid&s;t of the city. At the
commencement of &s;pring, the rookery, which during the continuance of winter
&s;eemed to have been de&s;erted, or only <PB N="232" REF="253"> guarded by
about five or &s;ix, like old &s;oldiers in a garri&s;on, now begins to be once
more fre|quented; and in a &s;hort time all the bu&s;tle and hurry of
bu&s;ine&s;s is fairly commenced. Where the&s;e numbers re&s;ided during the
winter is not ea&s;y to gue&s;s; perhaps in the trees of hedge-rows to be
nearer their food. In &s;pring, however, they cultivate their native trees;
and, in the places where they were them&s;elves hatched, they pre|pare to
propagate a future progeny.</P>
<P>They keep together in pairs; and when the offices of court&s;hip
are over, they prepare for making their ne&s;ts and laying. The old
inha|bitants of the place are all already provided; the ne&s;t which &s;erved
them for years before, with a little trimming and dre&s;&s;ing will &s;erve
very well again; the difficulty of ne&s;tling lies only upon the young ones who
have no ne&s;t, and mu&s;t therefore get up one as well as they can. But not
only the materials are wanting, but al&s;o the place in which to fix it. Every
part of a tree will not do for this purpo&s;e, as &s;ome branches may not be
&s;ufficiently forked; others may not be &s;ufficiently &s;trong; and &s;till
others may be too much expo&s;ed to the rockings of the wind. The male and
female upon this occa&s;ion are, for &s;ome days, &s;een examining all the
trees of the grove very attentively; and <PB N="233" REF="254"> when they have
fixed upon a branch that &s;eems fit for their purpo&s;e, they continue to fit
upon and ob&s;erve it very &s;edulou&s;ly for two or three days longer. The
place being thus deter|mined upon, they begin to gather the materials for their
ne&s;t; &s;uch as &s;ticks and fibrous roots, which they regularly di&s;po&s;e
in the mo&s;t &s;ub|&s;tantial manner. But here a new and unex|pected
ob&s;tacle ari&s;es. It often happens that the young couple have made choice of
a place too near the man&s;ion of an older pair, who do not chu&s;e to be
incommoded by &s;uch trouble|&s;ome neighbours. A quarrel therefore in&s;tantly
en&s;ues; in which the old ones are always vic|torious.</P>
<P>The young couple, thus expelled, are obliged again to go through
the fatigues of deliberating, examining, and chu&s;ing; and having taken care
to keep their due di&s;tance, the ne&s;t begins again, and their indu&s;try
de&s;erves commenda|tion. But their alacrity is often too great in the
beginning; they &s;oon grow weary of bringing the materials of their ne&s;t
from di&s;tant places; and they very ea&s;ily perceive that &s;ticks may be be
provided nearer home, with le&s;s hone&s;ty in|deed, but &s;ome degree of
addre&s;s. Away they go, therefore, to pilfer as fa&s;t as they can; and
wherever they &s;ee a ne&s;t unguarded, they take care to rob it of the very
choice&s;t &s;ticks of <PB N="234" REF="255"> which it is compo&s;ed. But
the&s;e thefts never go unpuni&s;hed; and probably upon complaint being made
there is a general puni&s;hment in|flicted. I have &s;een eight or ten rooks
come upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, and &s;etting upon the new ne&s;t of the young
couple all at once, tear it in pieces in a moment.</P>
<P>At length, therefore, the young pair find the nece&s;&s;ity of
going more regularly and hone&s;tly to work. While one flies to fetch the
materials, the other &s;its upon the tree to guard it; and thus in the &s;pace
of three or four days, with a &s;kirmi&s;h now and then between, the pair have
fitted up a commodious ne&s;t compo&s;ed of &s;ticks without, and of fibrous
roots and long gra&s;s within. From the in&s;tant the female begins to lay, all
ho&s;tilities are at an end; not one of the whole grove, that a little before
treated her &s;o rudely, will now venture to mole&s;t her; &s;o that &s;he
brings forth her brood with patient tranqui|lity. Such is the &s;everity with
which even na|tive rooks are treated by each other; but if a foreign rook
&s;hould attempt to make him&s;elf a denizen of their &s;ociety, he would meet
with no favour; the whole grove would at once be up in arms again&s;t him, and
expel him without mercy.</P>
<P>In &s;ome countries the&s;e birds are con&s;idered as a benefit,
in others as a nui&s;ance: their chief <PB N="235" REF="256"> food is the worm
of the dorbeetle and corn; thus they may be &s;aid to do as much &s;ervice by
de&s;troying that noxious in&s;ect, as they do injury by con&s;uming the
produce of the hu&s;|bandman's indu&s;try.</P>
<P>To this tribe of the crow-kind, &s;ome foreign &s;orts might be
added: I will take notice only of one, which from the extraordinary &s;ize and
fa&s;hion of its bill mu&s;t not be pa&s;&s;ed in &s;ilence. This is the Calao,
or horned Indian raven, which exceeds the common raven in &s;ize, and habits of
depre|dation. But what he differs in from all other birds is the beak, which,
by its length and cur|vature at the end, appears de&s;igned for rapine; but
then it has a kind of horn &s;tanding out from the top, which looks &s;omewhat
like a &s;econd bill, and gives this bird, otherwi&s;e fierce and ugly, a very
formidable appearance. The horn &s;prings out of the forehead, and grows to the
upper part of the bill, being of great bulk; &s;o that near the forehead it is
four inches broad, not unlike the horn of the rhinoceros, but more crooked at
the tip. Were the body of the bird an&s;werable in &s;ize to the head, the
calao would exceed in magnitude even the vulture or the eagle. But the head and
beak are out of all proportion, the body being not much larger than that of a
hen. Yet even here there are varieties; for in &s;uch of tho&s;e birds as come 
<PB N="236" REF="257"> from different parts of Africa, the body is
pro|portionable to the beak; in &s;uch as come from the Molucca I&s;lands, the
beak bears no pro|portion to the body. Of what u&s;e this extra|ordinary
excre&s;cence is to the bird is not ea&s;y to determine; it lives, like others
of its kind, upon carrion, and &s;eldom has a living enemy to cope with: Nature
&s;eems to &s;port in the pro|duction of many animals, as if &s;he were willing
to exhibit in&s;tances as well of variety as oeco|nomy in their formation.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="237" REF="258">
<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of the Magpie and its Affinities.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are &s;uch a variety of birds that may be di&s;tributed
under this head, that we mu&s;t not expect very preci&s;e ideas of any. To have
a &s;traight &s;trong bill, legs formed for hopping, a body of about the &s;ize
of a magpie, and party coloured plumage, are the only marks by which I mu&s;t
be contented to di&s;tingui&s;h this nume|rous phanta&s;tic tribe, that add to
the beauty, though not to the harmony of our land&s;capes. In fact, their
chattering every where di&s;turbs the melody of the le&s;&s;er warblers; and
their noi&s;y court&s;hip not a little damps the &s;ong of the linnet and the
nightingale.</P>
<P>However, we have very few of this kind in our woods compared to
tho&s;e in the neighbourhood of the line. There they not only paint the &s;cene
with the beauty and the variety of their plumage, but &s;tun the ear with their
vociferation. In tho&s;e luxurious fore&s;ts, the &s;inging birds are &s;carce
ever heard, but a hundred varieties of the pie, the jay, the roller, the
chatterer and the toucan, are continually in motion, and with their illu&s;ive
mockeries di&s;turb or divert the &s;pectator, as he happens to be
di&s;po&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="259">The magpie is the chief of this kind with
us, and is too well known to need a de&s;cription. Indeed, were its other
accompli&s;hments equal to its beauty, few birds could be put in com|petition.
Its black, its white, its green and purple, with the rich and gilded
combination of the glo&s;&s;es on its tail, are as fine as any that adorn the
mo&s;t beautiful of the fea|thered tribe. But it has too many of the qua|lities
of a beau, to depreciate the&s;e natural perfections: vain, re&s;tle&s;s, loud,
and quarrel|&s;ome, it is an unwelcome intruder every where; and never
mi&s;&s;es an opportunity, when it finds one, of doing mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>The magpie bears a great re&s;emblance to the butcher-bird in
its bill, which has a &s;harp pro|ce&s;s near the end of the upper chap, as
well as in the &s;hortne&s;s of its wings, and the form of the tail, each
feather &s;hortening from the two middlemo&s;t. But it agrees &s;till more in
its food, living not only upon worms and in&s;ects, but al&s;o upon &s;mall
birds when they can be &s;eized. A wounded lark, or a young chicken &s;eparated
from the hen, are &s;ure plunder; and the magpie will even &s;ometimes &s;et
upon and &s;trike a black-bird.</P>
<P>The &s;ame in&s;olence prompts it to teize the large&s;t animals
when its in&s;ults can be offered <PB N="239" REF="260"> with &s;ecurity. They
often are &s;een perched upon the back of an ox or a &s;heep, pecking up the
in&s;ects to be found there, chattering and tormenting the poor animal at the
&s;ame time, and &s;tretching out their necks for combat, if the bea&s;t turns
its head backward to reprehend them. They &s;eek out al&s;o the ne&s;ts of
birds; and, if the parent e&s;capes, the eggs make up for the deficiency: the
thru&s;h and the black-bird are but too frequently robbed by this
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, and this in &s;ome mea&s;ure cau&s;es their &s;carcity.</P>
<P>No food &s;eems to come ami&s;s to this bird; it &s;hares with
ravens in their carrion, with rooks in their grain, and with the cuckoo in
bird's eggs: but it &s;eems po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a providence &s;eldom u&s;ual
with gluttons; for when it is &s;atisfied for the pre&s;ent, it lays up the
remainder of the fea&s;t for another occa&s;ion. It will even in a tame &s;tate
hide its food when it has done eating, and after a time return to the &s;ecret
hoard with renewed appetite and vociferation.</P>
<P>In all its habits it di&s;covers a degree of in|&s;tinct
unu&s;ual to other birds. Its ne&s;t is not le&s;s remarkable for the manner in
which it is compo&s;ed than for the place the magpie takes to build it in. The
ne&s;t is u&s;ually placed con|&s;picuous enough, either in the middle of
&s;ome <PB N="240" REF="261"> hawthorn bu&s;h, or on the top of &s;ome high
tree. The place, however, is always found difficult of acce&s;s; for the tree
pitched upon u&s;ually grows in &s;ome thick hedge-row, fenced by brambles at
the root; or &s;ometimes one of the higher bu&s;hes is fixed upon for the
purpo&s;e. When the place is thus cho&s;en as inacce&s;&s;ible as po&s;&s;ible
to men, the next care is to fence the ne&s;t above &s;o as to defend it from
all the va|rious enemies of air. The kite, the crow, and the &s;parrow-hawk,
are to be guarded again&s;t; as their ne&s;ts have been &s;ometimes plundered
by the magpie, &s;o it is rea&s;onably feared that they will take the fir&s;t
opportunity to retaliate. To prevent this, the magpie's ne&s;t is built with
&s;urprizing labour and ingenuity.</P>
<P>The body of the ne&s;t is compo&s;ed of hawthorn branches; the
thorns &s;ticking outward, but well united together by their mutual
in&s;ertions. Within it is lined with fibrous roots, wool, and long gra&s;s,
and then nicely plai&s;tered all round with mud and clay. The body of the
ne&s;t being thus made firm and commodious, the next work is to make the canopy
which is to defend it above. This is compo&s;ed of the &s;harpe&s;t thorns,
wove together in &s;uch a manner as to deny all entrance except at the door,
which is ju&s;t large enough to permit egre&s;s and <PB N="241" REF="262">
regre&s;s to the owners. In this fortre&s;s the male and female hatch and bring
up their brood with &s;ecurity, &s;heltered from all attacks but tho&s;e of the
climbing &s;chool-boy, who often finds his torn and bloody hands too dear a
price for the eggs or the young ones. The magpie lays &s;ix or &s;even eggs, of
a pale green colour, &s;potted with brown.</P>
<P>This bird, in its dome&s;tic &s;tate, pre&s;erves its natural
character with &s;trict propriety. The &s;ame noi&s;y, mi&s;chievous habits
attend it to the cage that marked it in the woods; and being more cunning, &s;o
it is al&s;o a more docile bird than any other taken into keeping. Tho&s;e who
are de&s;irous of teaching it to &s;peak, have a fooli&s;h cu&s;tom of cutting
its tongue, which only puts the poor animal to pain, without improving its
&s;peech in the &s;malle&s;t degree. Its &s;peaking is &s;ometimes very
di&s;tinct; but its &s;ounds are too thin and &s;harp to be an exact imitation
of the human voice, which the hoar&s;e raven and parrot can counterfeit more
exactly.</P>
<P>To this tribe we may refer the Jay, which is one of the mo&s;t
beautiful of the Briti&s;h birds. The forehead is white, &s;treaked with black;
the head is covered with very long feathers, which it can erect into a cre&s;t
at plea&s;ure; the whole neck, back, brea&s;t and belly, are of a 
<PB N="242" REF="263"> faint purple, da&s;hed with grey; the wings are mo&s;t
beautifully barred with a lovely blue, black and white; the tail is black, and
the feet of a pale brown. Like the magpie, it feeds upon fruits, will kill
&s;mall birds, and is extremely docile.</P>
<P>The Chatterer al&s;o, which is a native of Germany, may be
placed in this rank; and is &s;omewhat le&s;s than the former. It is variegated
with a beautiful mixture of colours; red, a&s;h|colour, che&s;nut and yellow:
but what di&s;tin|gui&s;hes it from all other birds, are the horny appendages
from the tips of &s;even of the le&s;&s;er quill feathers, which &s;tand bare
of beards, and have the colour and glo&s;s of the be&s;t red &s;ealing|wax.</P>
<P>The Roller is not le&s;s beautiful than any of the former. The
brea&s;t and belly are blue; the head green; and the wings variegated with
blue, black and white. But it may be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from all others by a
&s;ort of naked tu|bercles or warts near the eyes, which &s;till far|ther
contribute to encrea&s;e its beauty.</P>
<P>To this cla&s;s may be added a numerous li&s;t from all the
tropical fore&s;ts of the ea&s;t and we&s;t; where the birds are remarkable for
di&s;cordant voices and brilliant plumage. I will fix only upon one, which is
the mo&s;t &s;ingular of all the <PB N="243" REF="264"> feathered creation.
This is the Toucan, a bird of the pie kind, who&s;e bill is nearly as large as
the re&s;t of its whole body.</P>
<P>Of this extraordinary bird there are four or five varieties. I
will only de&s;cribe the red beaked toucan; and as the figure of this bird
makes the principal part of its hi&s;tory, I will follow Edwards through all
the minutiae of its &s;ingular conformation. It is about the &s;ize of and
&s;haped like a jack-daw, with a large head to &s;upport its mon&s;trous bill:
this bill, from the angles of the mouth to its point, is &s;ix inches and an
half; and its breadth, in the thicke&s;t part, is a little more than two. Its
thickne&s;s near the head, is one inch and a quarter; and it is a little
rounded along the top of the upper chap, the under &s;ide being round al&s;o;
the whole of the bill extremely &s;light and a little thicker than parchment.
The upper chap is of a bright yellow, except on each &s;ide, which is of a fine
&s;carlet colour; as is al&s;o the lower chap, except at the ba&s;e, which is
purple. Between the head and the bill there is a black line of &s;eparation all
round the ba&s;e of the bill; in the upper part of which the no&s;trils are
placed, and are almo&s;t covered with feathers; which has occa&s;ioned &s;ome
writers to &s;ay, that <PB N="244" REF="265"> the toucan has no no&s;trils.
Round the eyes, on each &s;ide of the head, is a &s;pace of blui&s;h &s;kin,
void of feathers, above which the head is black, except a white &s;pot on each
&s;ide joining to the ba&s;e of the upper chap. The hinder part of the neck,
the back, wings, tail, belly and thighs, are black. The under &s;ide of the
head, throat, and the beginning of the brea&s;t, are white. Between the white
on the brea&s;t, and the black on the belly, is a &s;pace of red feathers, in
the form of a new moon, with its horns up|wards. The legs, feet and claws, are
of an a&s;h-colour; and the toes &s;tand like tho&s;e of parrots, two before,
and two behind.</P>
<P>It is reported, by travellers, that this bird, though
furni&s;hed with &s;o formidable a beak, is harmle&s;s and gentle, being &s;o
ea&s;ily made tame, as to &s;it and hatch its young in hou&s;es. It feeds
chiefly upon pepper, which it devours very greedily, gorging it&s;elf in &s;uch
a manner, that it voids it crude and unconcocted. This, however, is no
objection to the natives from u&s;ing it again; they even prefer it before that
pepper which is fre&s;h gathered from the tree: and &s;eem per&s;uaded that the
&s;trength and heat of the pepper is qualified by the bird, and that all its
noxious qualities are thus exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="266">Whatever be the truth of this report,
nothing is more certain than that the toucan lives only upon a vegetable diet;
and in a dome&s;tic &s;tate, to which it is frequently brought in the warm
countries where it is bred, it is &s;een to prefer &s;uch food to all other.
Pozzo, who bred one tame, a&s;&s;erts, that it leaped up and down, wagged the
tail, and cried with a voice re|&s;embling that of a magpie. It fed upon the
&s;ame things that parrots do; but was mo&s;t greedy of grapes, which, being
plucked off one by one, and thrown in the air, it would mo&s;t dexterou&s;ly
catch before they fell to the ground. Its bill, he adds, was hollow, and upon
that account very light, &s;o that it had but little &s;trength in &s;o
apparently formidable a weapon; nor could it peck or &s;trike &s;martly
therewith. But its tongue &s;eemed to a&s;&s;i&s;t the efforts of this unwieldy
machine: it was long, thin and flat, not unlike one of the feathers on the neck
of a dunghill cock; this it moved up and down, and often extended five or &s;ix
inches from the bill. It was of a fle&s;h colour, and very remarkably fringed
on each &s;ide with very &s;mall filaments, exactly re&s;embling a feather.</P>
<P>It is probable that this long tongue has greater &s;trength than
the thin hollow beak that <PB N="246" REF="267"> contains it. It is likely that
the beak is only a kind of &s;heath for this peculiar in&s;tru|ment, u&s;ed by
the toucan, not only in making it&s;elf a ne&s;t, but al&s;o in obtaining its
provi&s;ion. Nothing is more certain, than that this bird builds its ne&s;t in
holes of trees, which have been previou&s;ly &s;cooped out for this purpo&s;e;
and it is not very likely that &s;o feeble a bill could be very &s;erviceable
in working upon &s;uch hard materials.</P>
<P>Be this as it will, there is no bird &s;ecures its young better
from external injury than the toucan. It has not only birds, men, and
&s;er|pents to guard again&s;t, but a numerous tribe of monkies, &s;till more
prying, mi&s;chievous and hungry than all the re&s;t. The toucan, how|ever,
&s;coops out its ne&s;t into the hollow of &s;ome tree, leaving only a hole
large enough to go in and out at. There it &s;its, with its great beak,
guarding the entrance; and if the monkey ventures to offer a vi&s;it of
curio&s;ity, the toucan gives him &s;uch a welcome, that he pre&s;ently thinks
proper to pack off, and is glad to e&s;cape with &s;afety.</P>
<P>This bird is only found in the warm climates of South America,
where it is in great reque&s;t, both for the delicacy of its fle&s;h, which is
tender <PB N="247" REF="268"> and nouri&s;hing, and for the beauty of its
plu|mage, particularly the feathers of the brea&s;t. The &s;kin of this part
the Indians pluck off, and, when dry, glue to their cheeks; and this they
con&s;ider as an irre&s;i&s;tible addition to their beauty.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of the Wood-pecker and its Affinities.</HEAD>
<P>WE come now to the numerous tribe of Wood-peckers; a cla&s;s
ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hable from all others, both for their peculiar
forma|tion, their method of procuring food, and their manner of providing a
place of &s;afety for their young. Indeed, no other cla&s;s of birds &s;eems
more immediately formed for the method of life they pur&s;ue, being fitted by
nature, at all points, for the peculiarity of their con|dition. They live
chiefly upon the in&s;ects contained in the body of trees; and for this
purpo&s;e are furni&s;hed with a &s;traight, hard, &s;trong, angular and
&s;harp bill, made for pierc|ing and boring. They have a tongue of a very great
length; round, ending in a &s;harp, &s;tiff, bony thorn, dentated on each
&s;ide, to &s;trike ants and in&s;ects when di&s;lodged from their cells. Their
legs are &s;hort and &s;trong, for the pur|po&s;es of climbing. Their toes
&s;tand two forward, and two backward; which is parti|cularly &s;erviceable in
holding by branches of trees. They have hard &s;tiff tails, to lean upon when
climbing. They feed only upon in&s;ects, <PB N="249" REF="270"> and want that
inte&s;tine, which anatomi&s;ts call the caecum; a circum&s;tance peculiar to
this tribe only.</P>
<P>Of this bird there are many kinds, and many varieties in each
kind. They form large colo|nies in the fore&s;ts of every part of the world.
They differ in &s;ize, colour, and appearance; and agree only in the marks
above-mentioned, or in tho&s;e habits which re&s;ult from &s;o peculiar a
conformation. In&s;tead, therefore, of de|&s;cending into a minute
di&s;crimination of every &s;pecies, let us take one for a pattern, to which
all the re&s;t will be found to bear the &s;tronge&s;t affinity. Words can but
feebly de&s;cribe the plumage of a bird; but it is the province of hi&s;tory to
enter into a detail of every animal's pur&s;uits and occupations.</P>
<P>The Green Wood-&s;pite or Wood-pecker is called the Rain-Fowl in
&s;ome parts of the coun|try; becau&s;e, when it makes a greater noi&s;e than
ordinary, it is &s;uppo&s;ed to foretell rain. It is about the &s;ize of a jay;
the throat, brea&s;t and belly are of a pale greeni&s;h colour; and the back,
neck and covert feathers of the wings are green. But the tongue of this little
animal makes its mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed characteri&s;tic, as it &s;erves for
its &s;upport and defence. As was &s;aid above, the wood-pecker feeds upon
in&s;ects; and parti|cularly <PB N="250" REF="271"> on tho&s;e which are lodged
in the body of hollow or of rotting trees. The tongue is its in&s;trument for
killing and procuring this food; which cannot be found in great plenty. This is
round, ending in a &s;tiff, &s;harp, bony tip, dentated on both &s;ides, like
the beard of an arrow; and this it can dart out three or four inches from the
bill, and draw in again at plea&s;ure. Its prey is thus transfixed, and drawn
into the bill, which, when &s;wallowed, the dart is again launched at fre&s;h
game. Nothing has employed the attention of the curious in this part of
anatomy, more than the contrivance by which the tongue of this bird performs
its functions with &s;uch great celerity. The tongue is drawn back into the
bill by the help of two &s;mall round cartilages, fa&s;tened into the fore
mentioned bony tip, and running along the length of the tongue. The&s;e
cartilages, from the root of the tongue, take a circuit beyond the ears; and
being reflected backwards to the crown of the head, make a large bow. The
mu&s;cular, &s;pongy fle&s;h of the tongue, enclo&s;es the&s;e cartilages, like
a &s;heath; and is &s;o made, that it may be extended or contracted like a
worm. The cartilages indeed have mu&s;cles accompanying them along their whole
length backwards. But there is &s;till another con|trivance; 
<PB N="251" REF="272"> for there is a broad mu&s;cle, joining the cartilages to
the bones of the &s;kull, which, by contracting or dilating, forces the
cartilages forward through the tongue, and then forces the tongue and all
through the bill, to be employed for the animal's pre&s;ervation, in piercing
its prey.</P>
<P>Such is the in&s;trument with which this bird is provided; and
this is the manner in which this in&s;trument is employed. When a wood-pecker,
by its natural &s;agacity, finds out a rotten hollow tree, where there are
worms, ant's eggs, or in&s;ects, it immediately prepares for its operations.
Re&s;ting by its &s;trong claws, and leaning on the thick feathers of its tail,
it begins to bore with its &s;harp &s;trong beak, until it di&s;clo&s;es the
whole internal habitation. Upon this, either through plea&s;ure at the &s;ight
of its prey, or with a de&s;ire to alarm the in&s;ect colony, it &s;ends forth
a loud cry, which throws terror and confu&s;ion into the whole in&s;ect tribe.
They creep hither and thither, &s;eeking for &s;afety; while the bird
luxuriou&s;ly fea&s;ts upon them at lei&s;ure, darting its tongue with unerring
cer|tainty, and devouring the whole brood.</P>
<P>The wood-pecker, however, does not con|fine its depredations
&s;olely to trees, but &s;ome|times lights upon the ground, to try its for|tune
<PB N="252" REF="273"> tune at an ant-hill. It is not &s;o &s;ecure of prey
there as in the former ca&s;e, although the num|bers are much greater. They lie
generally too deep for the bird to come at them; and it is obliged to make up
by &s;tratagem the defect of power. The wood-pecker fir&s;t goes to their
hills, which it pecks, in order to call them abroad; it then thru&s;ts out its
long red tongue, which being like a worm, and re&s;embling their u&s;ual prey,
the ants come out to &s;ettle upon in great numbers; however, the bird watching
the propere&s;t opportunity, withdraws its tongue at a jerk, and devours the
devourers. This &s;tra|tagem it continues till it has alarmed their fears; or
till it is quite &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>As the wood pecker is obliged to make holes in trees to procure
food, &s;o is it al&s;o to make cavities &s;till larger to form its ne&s;t and
to lay in. This is performed, as u&s;ual, with the bill; although &s;ome have
affirmed that the animal u&s;es its tongue, as a gimblet, to bore with. But
this is a mi&s;take; and tho&s;e that are curious, may often hear the noi&s;e
of the bill making its way in large woods and fore&s;ts. The wood-pecker
chu&s;es, however, for this purpo&s;e, trees that are decayed, or wood that is
&s;oft, like beech, elm and poplar. In the&s;e, with very little trouble, it
can make holes as exactly round <PB REF="274">

compa&s;&s;es. One of the&s;e holes the bird generally chu&s;es for its own
u&s;e, to ne&s;tle, and bring up its young in: but as they are ea&s;ily made,
it is delicate in its choice, and often makes twenty before one is found fit to
give entire &s;atisfaction. Of tho&s;e which it has made and de&s;erted, other
birds, not &s;o good borers, and le&s;s delicate in their choice, take
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The jay and the &s;tarling lay their eggs in the&s;e holes;
and bats are now and then found in peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Boys
&s;ometimes have thru&s;t in their hands with certain hopes of plucking out a
bird's egg; but, to their great mortification have had their fingers bitten by
a bat at the bottom.</P>
<P>The wood-pecker takes no care to line its ne&s;t with feathers
or &s;traw; its eggs are depo|&s;ited in the hole, without any thing to keep
them warm, except the heat of the parent's body. Their number is generally five
or &s;ix; always white, oblong, and of a middle &s;ize. When the young are
excluded, and before they leave the ne&s;t, they are adorned with a &s;carlet
plu|mage under the throat, which adds to their beauty.</P>
<P>In our climate, this bird is contented with &s;uch a wain&s;cot
habitation as has been de&s;cribed for its young; but in the warmer regions of

<PB N="254" REF="278"> Guinea and Bra&s;il, they take a very different method
to protect and hatch their na&s;cent progeny. A traveller who walks into the
fore&s;ts of tho&s;e countries, among the fir&s;t &s;trange objects that excite
curio&s;ity, is &s;truck with the multitude of bird's-ne&s;ts hanging at the
extremity of almo&s;t every branch. Many other kind of birds build in this
manner; but the chief of them are of the wood-pecker kind: and indeed, there is
not, in the whole hi&s;tory of nature, a more &s;ingular in&s;tance of the
&s;agacity of tho&s;e little animals in protecting them&s;elves again&s;t
&s;uch enemies as they have mo&s;t occa&s;ion to fear. In cultivated countries,
a great part of the caution of the feathered tribe is to hide or defend their
ne&s;ts from the inva&s;ions of man, as he is their mo&s;t dreaded enemy. But
in the depth of tho&s;e remote and &s;olitary fore&s;ts, where man is but
&s;eldom &s;een, the little bird has nothing to apprehend from man. The parent
is carele&s;s how much the ne&s;t is expo&s;ed to general notice; &s;atisfied
if it be out of the reach of tho&s;e rapa|cious creatures that live by robbery
and &s;urprize. If the monkey or the &s;nake can be guarded again&s;t, the bird
has no other enemies to fear: for this purpo&s;e, its ne&s;t is built upon the
depend|ing points of the mo&s;t outward branches of a tall tree, &s;uch as the
banana or the plantane. On <PB N="255" REF="279"> one of tho&s;e immen&s;e
trees, is &s;een the mo&s;t various, and the mo&s;t inimical a&s;&s;emblage of
creatures that can be imagined. The top is in|habited by monkies of &s;ome
particular tribe, that drive off all others; lower down twine about the great
trunk numbers of the larger &s;nakes, patiently waiting till &s;ome unwary
ani|mal comes within the &s;phere of their activity; and at the edges of the
tree hang the&s;e artificial ne&s;ts, in great abundance, inhabited by birds of
the mo&s;t delightful plumage.</P>
<P>The ne&s;t is u&s;ually formed in this manner: When the time of
incubation approaches, they fly bu&s;ily about, in que&s;t of a kind of mo&s;s,
called, by the Engli&s;h inhabitants of tho&s;e countries, <HI>old man's
beard.</HI> It is a fibrous &s;ub|&s;tance, and not very unlike hair, which
bears being moulded into any form, and &s;uffers being glued together. This,
therefore, the little wood-pecker, called by the natives of Bra&s;il, the
Guiratemga, fir&s;t glues by &s;ome vi&s;cous &s;ub|&s;tance, gathered in the
fore&s;t, to the extreme&s;t branch of a tree; then building downward, and
&s;till adding fre&s;h materials to tho&s;e already procured, a ne&s;t is
formed, that depends, like a pouch, from the point of the branch: the hole to
enter at, is on the &s;ide; and all the interior parts are lined with the finer
fibres of the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance, which compo&s;e the whole.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="280">Such is the general contrivance of the&s;e
hang|ing ne&s;ts; which are made, by &s;ome other birds, with &s;till
&s;uperior art. A little bird of the Gro&s;|beak kind, in the Philippine
i&s;lands, makes its ne&s;t in &s;uch a manner that there is no opening but
from the bottom. At the bottom the bird enters, and goes up through a funnel,
like a chimney, till it comes to the real door of the ne&s;t, which lies on one
&s;ide, and only opens into this funnel.</P>
<P>Some birds glue their ne&s;t to the leaf of the banana-tree,
which makes two &s;ides of their little habitation; while the other two are
ar|tificially compo&s;ed by their own indu&s;try. But the&s;e, and all of the
kind, are built with the &s;ame precautions to guard the young again&s;t the
depredations of monkies and &s;erpents, which abound in every tree. The ne&s;t
hangs there, before the &s;poilers, a tempting object, which they can only gaze
upon, while the bird flies in and out, without danger or mole&s;tation, from
&s;o formidable a vicinity.</P>

The native &s;avages of the Molucca I&s;lands, of which it is an inhabitant,
were very little &s;tudious of natu|ral hi&s;tory; and, perceiving the
inclination the Europeans had for this beautiful bird, carefully cut off its
legs before they brought it to market; thus concealing its greate&s;t
deformity, they con&s;idered them&s;elves entitled to ri&s;e in their demands
when they offered it for &s;ale. One deceit led on to another; the buyer
finding the bird without legs, naturally enquired after them; and the &s;eller
as naturally began to a&s;&s;ert that it <PB REF="283">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"> <PB N="257" REF="284">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"> <PB N="258" REF="285"> had
none. Thus far the European was impo&s;ed upon by others; in all the re&s;t he
impo&s;ed upon him&s;elf. Seeing &s;o beautiful a bird without legs, he
concluded that it could live only in air, where legs were unnece&s;&s;ary. The
extraordi|nary &s;plendour of its plumage a&s;&s;i&s;ted this de|ception; and
as it had heavenly beauty, &s;o it was a&s;&s;erted to have an heavenly
re&s;idence. From thence its name, and all the fal&s;e reports that have been
propagated concerning it.</P>
<P>Error, however, is &s;hort-lived; and time has di&s;covered that
this bird not only has legs, but very large &s;trong ones for its &s;ize.
Credulity when undeceived runs into the oppo&s;ite ex|treme; and &s;oon after
this harmle&s;s bird was branded with the character of being rapacious, of
de&s;troying all tho&s;e of &s;maller &s;ize, and, from the amazing rapidity of
its flight, as qualified peculiarly for exten&s;ive rapine. The real hi&s;tory
of this pretty animal is at pre&s;ent tolerably well known; and it is found to
be as harmle&s;s as it is beautiful.</P>
<P>There are two kinds of the bird of Paradi&s;e; one about the
&s;ize of a pigeon, which is more common; the other not much larger than a
lark, which has been de&s;cribed more imper|fectly. They are both
&s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;hed from all other birds, not only by the
&s;uperior <PB N="259" REF="286"> vivacity of their tints, but by the feathers
of the tail, there being two long &s;lender filaments growing from the upper
part of the rump, the&s;e are longer than the bird's body, and bearded only at
the end. By this mark the bird of Paradi&s;e may be ea&s;ily known, but &s;till
more ea&s;ily by its gaudy livery, which being &s;o very brilliant, demands to
be minutely de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>This bird appears to the eye as large as a pigeon, though in
reality the body is not much greater than that of a thru&s;h. The tail, which
is about &s;ix inches, is as long as the body; the wings are large compared
with the bird's other dimen&s;ions. The head, the throat and the neck are of a
pale gold colour. The ba&s;e of the bill is &s;urrounded by black feathers, as
al&s;o the &s;ide of the head and throat, as &s;oft as velvet, and changeable
like tho&s;e on the neck of a mallard. The hinder part of the head is of a
&s;hining green, mixed with gold. The body and wings are chiefly covered with
beautiful brown, purple and gold feathers. The upper|mo&s;t part of the tail
feathers are of a pale yel|low, and tho&s;e under them white and longer than
the former; for which rea&s;on the hinder part of the tail appears to be all
white. But what chiefly excites curio&s;ity are, the two long naked feathers
above-mentioned, which &s;pring <PB N="260" REF="287"> from the upper part of
the rump above the tail, and which are u&s;ually about three feet long. The&s;e
are bearded only at the beginning and the end; the whole &s;haft for above two
feet nine inches being of a deep black, while the fea|thered extremity is of a
changeable colour, like the mallard's neck.</P>
<P>This bird, which for beauty exceeds all others of the pie kind,
is a native of the Molucca I&s;lands, but found in greate&s;t numbers in that
of Aro. There, in the delightful and &s;picy woods of the country, do the&s;e
beautiful crea|tures fly in large flocks; &s;o that the groves which produce
the riche&s;t &s;pices produce the fine&s;t birds al&s;o. The inhabitants
them&s;elves are not in&s;en&s;ible of the plea&s;ure the&s;e afford, and give
them the name of God's birds, as being &s;uperior to all others that he has
made. They live in large flocks, and at night generally perch upon the &s;ame
tree. They are called by &s;ome, the Swallows of Ternate, from their rapid
flight, and from their being continually on the wing in pur&s;uit of in&s;ects,
their u&s;ual prey.</P>
<P>As the country where they are bred has its tempe&s;tuous
&s;ea&s;on, when rains and thunders continually di&s;turb the atmo&s;phere,
the&s;e birds are then but &s;eldom &s;een. It is thought that 
<PB N="261" REF="288"> they then fly to other countries where their food
appears in greater abundance; for, like &s;wallows, they have their &s;tated
times of return. In the beginning of the month of Augu&s;t, they are &s;een in
great numbers flying together; and, as the inhabitants would have us believe,
follow|ing their king, who is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t by the lu&s;tre
of his plumage, and that re|&s;pect and veneration which is paid him. In the
evening they perch upon the highe&s;t trees of the fore&s;t, particularly one
which bears a red berry, upon which they &s;ometimes feed, when other food
fails them. In what manner they breed, or what may be the number of their
young, as yet remains for di&s;covery.</P>
<P>The natives, who make a trade of killing and &s;elling the&s;e
birds to the Europeans, gene|rally conceal them&s;elves in the trees where they
re&s;ort, and having covered them&s;elves up from &s;ight in a bower made of
the branches, they &s;hoot at the birds with reedy arrows; and, as they
a&s;&s;ert, if they happen to kill the king, they then have a good chance for
killing the greate&s;t part of the flock. The chief mark by which they know the
king is by the ends of the feathers in his tail, which have eyes like tho&s;e
of a peacock. When they have taken a number <PB N="262" REF="289"> of the&s;e
birds, their u&s;ual method is to gut them and cut off their legs; they then
run a hot iron into the body, which dries up the internal moi&s;ture; and
filling the cavity with &s;alts and &s;pices, they &s;ell them to the Europeans
for a per|fect trifle.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. The Cuckoo and its Varieties.</HEAD>
<P>FROM a bird of which many fables have been reported, we pa&s;s
to another that has not given le&s;s &s;cope to fabulous invention. The note of
the cuckoo is known to all the world; the hi&s;tory and nature of the bird
it&s;elf &s;till remains in great ob&s;curity. That it devours its parent, that
it changes its nature with the &s;ea&s;on, and becomes a &s;parrow-hawk, were
fables invented of this bird, and are now &s;uffi|ciently refuted. But where it
re&s;ides in winter, or how it provides for its &s;upply during that
&s;ea&s;on, &s;till continues undi&s;covered.</P>
<P>This &s;ingular bird, which is &s;omewhat le&s;s than a pigeon,
&s;haped like a magpie, and of a greyi&s;h colour, is di&s;tingui&s;hed from
all other birds, by its round prominent no&s;trils. Having di&s;appeared all
the winter, it di&s;covers it&s;elf in our country early in the &s;pring, by
its well known call. Its note is heard earlier or later as the &s;ea&s;on
&s;eems to be more or le&s;s forward, and the weather more or le&s;s inviting.
From the chearful voice of this bird the farmer may be in&s;tructed in the real
advancement of the year. <PB N="264" REF="291"> The fallibility of human

which, as the &s;ummer advances, improves both in its frequency and loudne&s;s.
This is an invitation to court&s;hip, and u&s;ed only by the male, who &s;its
generally perched upon &s;ome dead tree, or bare bough, and repeats his &s;ong,
which he lo&s;es as &s;oon as the genial &s;ea&s;on is over. His note is
plea&s;ant though uniform; and, from an a&s;&s;ociation of ideas, &s;eldom
occurs to the me|mory without reminding us of the &s;weets of &s;ummer.
Cu&s;tom too has affixed a more ludi|crous a&s;&s;ociation to this note; which,
however, we that are batchelors need be in no pain about. This reproach &s;eems
to ari&s;e from this bird's making u&s;e of the bed or ne&s;t of another to
depo&s;it its own brood in.</P>
<P>However this may be, nothing is more cer|tain than that the
female makes no ne&s;t of her own. She repairs for that purpo&s;e to the ne&s;t
<PB N="265" REF="292"> of &s;ome other bird, generally the water-wagtail or
hedge &s;parrow, and, having devoured the eggs of the owner, lays her own in
their place. She u&s;ually lays but one, which is &s;peckled, and of the &s;ize
of a blackbird's. This the fond fooli&s;h bird hatches with great
a&s;&s;iduity, and, when excluded, finds no difference in the great ill-looking
changeling from her own. To &s;upply this voracious creature, the credu|lous
nur&s;e toils with unu&s;ual labour, no way &s;en&s;ible that &s;he is feeding
up an enemy to her race, and one of the mo&s;t de&s;tructive robbers of her
future progeny.</P>
<P>It was once doubted whether the&s;e birds were carnivorous; but
Reaumur was at the pains of breeding up &s;everal, and found that they would
not feed upon bread or corn; but fle&s;h and in&s;ects were their favourite
nouri&s;hment. He found it a very difficult ta&s;k to teach them to peck; for
he was obliged to feed them for a full month, after they were grown as big as
the mother. In&s;ects, however, &s;eemed to be their peculiar food when young;
for they devoured fle&s;h by a kind of con&s;traint, as it was always put into
their mouths; but meal-worm in&s;ects they flew to, and &s;wallowed of their
own ac|cord mo&s;t greedily. Indeed, their gluttony is not to be wondered at,
when we con&s;ider the <PB N="266" REF="293"> capacity of their &s;tomach,
which is enormous, and reaches from the brea&s;t-bone to the vent. It is partly
membranous, partly mu&s;cular, and of a prodigious capacity; yet &s;till they
are not to be &s;uppo&s;ed as birds of prey, for they have neither the
&s;trength nor the courage. On the contrary, they are naturally weak and
fearful, as appears by their flying from &s;mall birds which every where
pur&s;ue them. The young birds are brown mixed with black; and in that &s;tate
they have been de&s;cribed by &s;ome authors as old ones.</P>
<P>The cuckoo, when fledged and fitted for flight, follows its
&s;uppo&s;ed parent but for a little time; its appetites for in&s;ect food
encrea&s;|ing, as it finds no great chance for a &s;upply in imitating its
little in&s;tructor, it parts good friends, the &s;tep-child &s;eldom offering
any violence to its nur&s;e. Neverthele&s;s, all the little birds of the grove
&s;eem to con&s;ider the young cuckoo as an enemy, and revenge the cau&s;e of
their kind by their repeated in&s;ults. They pur&s;ue it wherever it flies, and
oblige it to take &s;helter in the thicke&s;t branches of &s;ome neighbouring
tree. All the &s;maller birds form the train of its pur&s;uers; but the
wry-neck, in particular, is found the mo&s;t active in the cha&s;e; and from
thence it has been called by many <PB N="267" REF="294"> the cuckoo's attendant
and provider. But it is very far from following with a friendly inten|tion; it
only pur&s;ues as an in&s;ulter, or a &s;py, to warn all its little companions
of the cuckoo's depredations.</P>
<P>Such are the manners of this bird while it continues to
re&s;ide, or to be &s;een among&s;t us. But early, at the approach of winter,
it totally di&s;appears, and its pa&s;&s;age can be traced to no other counrty.
Some &s;uppo&s;e that it lies hid in hollow trees; and others that it
pa&s;&s;es into warmer climates. Which of the&s;e opinions is true is very
uncertain, as there are no facts related on either &s;ide that can be totally
relied on. To &s;upport the opinion that they remain torpid during the winter,
at home, Willoughby introduces the following &s;tory, which he delivers upon
the credit of another. 
<Q REND="inline">"The &s;ervants of a gentleman, in the country,
having &s;tocked up, in one of their meadows, &s;ome old dry rotten willows,
thought proper, on a certain occa&s;ion, to carry them home. In heating a
&s;tove, two logs of this timber were put into the furnace beneath, and fire
applied as u&s;ual. But &s;oon, to the great &s;urprize of the family, was
heard the voice of a cuckoo, &s;inging three times from under the &s;tove.
Won|dering at &s;o extraordinary a cry in winter <PB N="268" REF="295"> time,
the &s;ervants ran and drew the willow logs from the furnace, and in the
mid&s;t one of them &s;aw &s;omething move: wherefore, taking an ax, they
opened the hole, and thru&s;ting in their hands, fir&s;t they plucked out
nothing but feathers; afterwards they got hold of a living animal; and this was
the cuckoo that had waked &s;o very opportunely for its own &s;afety. It was,
indeed," conti|nues our hi&s;torian, "bri&s;k and lively, but wholly naked and
bare of feathers, and without any winter provi&s;ion in its hole. This cuckoo
the boys kept two years after|wards alive in the &s;tove; but whether it
re|paid them with a &s;econd &s;ong, the author of the tale has not thought fit
to inform us."</Q></P>
<P>The mo&s;t probable opinion on this &s;ubject is, that as quails
and wood-cocks &s;hift their habi|tations in winter, &s;o al&s;o does the
cuckoo; but to what country it retires, or whether it has been ever &s;een on
its journey, are que&s;tions that I am wholly incapable of re&s;olving.</P>
<P>Of this bird there are many kinds in various parts of the world,
not only differing in their colours but their &s;ize. Bri&s;&s;on makes not
le&s;s than twenty-eight &s;orts of them; but what ana|logy they bear to our
Engli&s;h cuckoo I will not take upon me to determine. He talks of one, 
<PB N="269" REF="296"> particularly of Bra&s;il, as making a mo&s;t horrible
noi&s;e in the fore&s;ts; which, as it &s;hould &s;eem, mu&s;t be a very
different note from that by which our bird is di&s;tingui&s;hed at home.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Of the Parrot and its Affinities.</HEAD>
<P>THE Parrot is the be&s;t known among us of all foreign birds, as
it unites the greate&s;t beauty with the greate&s;t docility. Its voice al&s;o
is more like a man's than that of any other; the raven is too hoar&s;e, and the
jay and magpie too &s;hrill, to re&s;emble the truth; the parrot's note is of
the true pitch, and capable of a number of modulations that even &s;ome of our
orators might wi&s;h in vain to imitate.</P>
<P>The ea&s;e with which this bird is taught to &s;peak, and the
great number of words which it is capable of repeating, are no le&s;s
&s;urprizing. We are a&s;&s;ured, by a grave writer, that one of the&s;e was
taught to repeat a whole &s;onnet from Petrarch; and that I may not be wanting
in my in&s;tance, I have &s;een a parrot, belonging to a di&s;tiller, who had
&s;uffered pretty largely in his circum&s;tances from an informer who lived
op|po&s;ite him, very ridiculou&s;ly employed. This bird was taught to
pronounce the ninth com|mandment,

neighbourhood with its per&s;evering exhortations.</P>
<P>Willoughby tells a &s;tory of a parrot, which is not &s;o dull
as tho&s;e u&s;ually brought up when this bird's facility of talking happens to
be the &s;ubject. 
<Q REND="inline">"A parrot belonging to king Henry the Seventh,
who then re&s;ided at We&s;tmin&s;ter, in his palace by the river Thames, had
learned to talk many words from the pa&s;&s;engers as they happened to take
water. One day, &s;porting on its perch, the poor bird fell into the water, at
the &s;ame time crying out, as loud as he could, <HI>A boat, twenty pound for a
boat.</HI> A waterman, who happened to be near, hearing the cry, made to the
place where the parrot was floating, and taking him up re&s;tored him to the
king. As it &s;eems the bird was a favourite, the man in&s;i&s;ted that he
ought to have a reward rather equal to his &s;ervices than his trouble; and, as
the parrot had cried twenty pounds, he &s;aid the king was bound in honour to
grant it. The king at la&s;t agreed to leave it to the parrot's own
determination, which the bird hearing, cried out, <HI>Give the knave a
groat.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>The parrot, which is &s;o common as a foreign bird with us, is
equally &s;o as an indignous bird in the climates where it is produced. The
fo|re&s;ts <PB N="272" REF="302"> &s;warm with them; and the rook is not better
known with us than the parrot in al|mo&s;t every part of the Ea&s;t and
We&s;tern Indies. It is in vain that our naturali&s;ts have attempted to
arrange the various &s;pecies of this bird; new varieties daily offer to puzzle
the &s;y&s;tem-maker, or to demon&s;trate the narrowne&s;s of his cata|logues.
Linnaeus makes the number of its varieties amount to forty-&s;even; while
Bri&s;&s;on doubles the number, and extends his catalogue to ninety-five.
Perhaps even this li&s;t might be encrea&s;ed, were every accidental change of
co|lour to be con&s;idered as con&s;tituting a new &s;pecies. But, in fact,
natural hi&s;tory gains little by the&s;e di&s;coveries; and as its dominions
are extended it becomes more barren. It is a&s;&s;erted, by &s;en&s;ible
travellers, that the natives of Bra&s;il can change the colour of a parrot's
plumage by art. If this be true, and I am apt to believe the information, they
can make new &s;pecies at plea&s;ure, and thus cut out endle&s;s work for our
nomenclators at home.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who u&s;ually bring the&s;e birds over are content to
make three or four di&s;tinctions, to which they give names; and with the&s;e
di&s;tinctions I will content my&s;elf al&s;o. The large kind, which are of the
&s;ize of a raven, are called Maccaws; the next &s;ize are &s;imply called
Parrots; tho&s;e which are entirely white are called Lories; and 
<PB N="273" REF="303"> the le&s;&s;er &s;ize of all are called Parakeets. The
difference between even the&s;e is rather in the &s;ize than in any other
peculiar conformation, as they are all formed alike, having toes two before and
two behind for climbing and holding; &s;trong hooked bills for breaking open
nuts, and other hard &s;ub&s;tances, on which they feed; and loud har&s;h
voices, by which they fill their na|tive woods with clamour.</P>
<P>But there are further peculiarities in the conformation: and
fir&s;t, their toes are contrived in a &s;ingular manner, which appears when
they walk or climb, and when they are eating. For the fir&s;t purpo&s;e they
&s;tretch two of their toes forward and two backward; but when they take their
meat, and bring it to their mouths with their foot, they dexterou&s;ly and
nimbly turn the greater hind toe forward, &s;o as to take a firmer gra&s;p of
the nut or the fruit they are going to feed on, &s;tanding all the while upon
the other leg. Nor even do they pre&s;ent their food in the u&s;ual manner; for
other animals turn their meat inwards to the mouth; but the&s;e, in a
&s;eemingly aukward po&s;ition, turn their meat outwards, and thus hold the
harde&s;t nuts, as if in one hand, till with their bills they break the
&s;hell, and extract the kernel.</P>
<P>The bill is fa&s;hioned with &s;till greater pecu|liarites; 
<PB N="274" REF="304"> for the upper chap, as well as the lower, are both
moveable. In mo&s;t other birds the upper chap is connected, and makes but one
piece with the &s;kull; but in the&s;e, and in one or two &s;pecies of the
feathered tribe more, the upper chap is connected to the bone of the head by a
&s;trong membrane, placed on each &s;ide, that lifts and depre&s;&s;es it at
plea&s;ure. By this contrivance they can open their bills the wider; which is
not a little u&s;eful, as the upper chap is &s;o hooked and &s;o over-hanging,
that, if the lower chap only had motion, they could &s;carce gape
&s;ufficiently to take any thing in for their nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P>Such are the u&s;es of the beak and the toes when u&s;ed
&s;eparately, but they are often em|ployed both together when the bird is
exerci&s;ed in climbing. As the&s;e birds cannot readily hop from bough to
bough, their legs not being adapted for that purpo&s;e, they u&s;e both the
beak and the feet; fir&s;t catching hold with the beak, as if with a hook, then
drawing up the legs and fa&s;tening them, then advancing the head and the beak
again, and &s;o putting for|ward the body and the feet alternately, till they
attain the height they a&s;pire to.</P>
<P>The tongue of this bird &s;omewhat re&s;embles that of a man;
for which rea&s;on, &s;ome pretend <PB N="275" REF="305"> that it is &s;o well
qualified to imitate the human &s;peech; but the organs by which the&s;e
&s;ounds are articulated lie farther down in the throat, being performed by the
great motion which the os hyoides has in the&s;e birds above others.</P>
<P>The parrot, though common enough in Europe, will not, however,
breed here. The climate is too cold for its warm con&s;titution; and though it
bears our winter when arrived at maturity, yet it always &s;eems &s;en&s;ible
of its rigour, and lo&s;es both its &s;pirit and appetite during the colder
part of the &s;ea&s;on. It then becomes torpid and inactive, and &s;eems quite
changed from that bu&s;tling loquacious animal which it appeared in its native
fore&s;ts, where it is almo&s;t ever upon the wing. Notwith&s;tanding, the
parrot lives even with us a con&s;iderable time, if it be properly attended to;
and, indeed, it mu&s;t be owned, that it employs but too great a part of &s;ome
people's attention.</P>
<P>The extreme &s;agacity and docility of the bird may plead as the
be&s;t excu&s;e for tho&s;e who &s;pend whole hours in teaching their parrots
to &s;peak; and, indeed, the bird, on tho&s;e occa|&s;ions, &s;eems the
wi&s;e&s;t animal of the two. It at fir&s;t ob&s;tinately re&s;i&s;ts all
in&s;truction; but &s;eems to be won by per&s;everance, makes a few attempts to
imitate the fir&s;t &s;ounds, and when <PB N="276" REF="306"> it has got one
word di&s;tinct, all the &s;ucceeding come with greater facility. The bird
gene|rally learns mo&s;t in tho&s;e families where the ma&s;ter or mi&s;tre&s;s
have the lea&s;t to do; and becomes more expert, in proportion as its
in|&s;tructors are idly a&s;&s;iduous. In going through the towns of France
&s;ometime &s;ince, I could not help ob&s;erving how much plainer their parrots
&s;poke than ours, and how very di&s;tinctly I under|&s;tood their parrots
&s;peak French, when I could not under&s;tand our own, though they &s;poke my
native language. I was at fir&s;t for a&s;crib|ing it to the different
qualities of the two lan|guages, and was for entering into an elaborate
di&s;cu&s;&s;ion on the vowels and con&s;onants; but a friend that was with me
&s;olved the difficulty at once, by a&s;&s;uring me that the French women
&s;carce did any thing el&s;e the whole day than &s;it and in&s;truct their
feathered pupils; and that the birds were thus di&s;tinct in their le&s;&s;ons
in con|&s;equence of continual &s;chooling.</P>
<P>The parrots of France are certainly very ex|pert, but nothing to
tho&s;e of the Bra&s;ils, where the education of a parrot is con&s;idered as a
very &s;erious affair. The Hi&s;tory of Prince Maurice's parrot, given us by
Mr. Locke, is too well known to be repeated here; but Clu&s;ius a&s;&s;ures us
that the parrots of that country are the mo&s;t <PB N="277" REF="307">
&s;en&s;ible and cunning of all animals not endued with rea&s;on. The great
parrot, called the Aicurous, the head of which is adorned with yellow, red and
violet, the body green, the ends of the wings red, the feathers of the tail
long and yellow; this bird, he a&s;&s;erts, which is &s;eldom brought into
Europe, is a prodigy of under&s;tanding. 
<Q REND="inline">"A certain Bra&s;ilian woman, that lived in a
village two miles di&s;tant from the i&s;land on which we re&s;ided, had a
parrot of this kind which was the wonder of the place. It &s;eemed endued with
&s;uch under&s;tanding, as to di&s;cern and comprehend whatever &s;he &s;aid to
it. As we &s;ometimes u&s;ed to pa&s;s by that woman's hou&s;e, &s;he u&s;ed to
call upon us to &s;top, promi&s;ing, if we gave her a comb, or a
looking-gla&s;s, that &s;he would make her parrot &s;ing and dance to entertain
us. If we agreed to her reque&s;t, as &s;oon as &s;he had pronounced &s;ome
words to the bird, it began not only to leap and &s;kip on the perch on which
it &s;tood, but al&s;o to talk and to whi&s;tle, and imitate the &s;houtings
and exclamations of the Bra&s;ilians when they prepare for battle. In brief,
when it came into the woman's head to bid it &s;ing, it &s;ang; to dance, it
danced. But if, contrary to our promi&s;e, we refu&s;ed to give the wo|man the
little pre&s;ent agreed on, the parrot <PB N="278" REF="308"> &s;eemed to
&s;ympathize in her re&s;entment, and was &s;ilent and immoveable; neither
could we, by any means, provoke it to move either foot or tongue."</Q></P>
<P>This &s;agacity, which parrots &s;hew in a do|me&s;tic &s;tate,
&s;eems al&s;o natural to them in their native re&s;idence among the woods.
They live together in flocks, and mutually a&s;&s;i&s;t each other again&s;t
other animals, either by their courage or their notes of warning. They
generally breed in hollow trees, where they make a round hole, and do not line
their ne&s;t within. If they find any part of a tree be|ginning to rot from the
breaking off a branch, or any &s;uch accident, this they take care to &s;coop,
and to make the hole &s;ufficiently wide and convenient; but it &s;ometimes
happens that they are content with the hole which a wood-pecker has wrought out
with greater ea&s;e before them; and in this they prepare to hatch and bring up
their young.</P>
<P>They lay two or three eggs; and probably the &s;maller kind may
lay more; for it is a rule that univer&s;ally holds through nature, that the
&s;malle&s;t animals are always the mo&s;t prolific; for being, from their
natural weakne&s;s, more &s;ubject to deva&s;tation, Nature finds it
nece&s;&s;ary to repleni&s;h the &s;pecies by &s;uperior fecundity. In general,
however, the number of their eggs <PB N="279" REF="309"> is &s;tinted to two,
like tho&s;e of the pigeon, and they are about the &s;ame &s;ize. They are
always marked with little &s;pecks, like tho&s;e of a par|tridge; and &s;ome
travellers a&s;&s;ure us, that they are always found in the trunks of the
talle&s;t, &s;traighte&s;t, and the large&s;t trees. The natives of the&s;e
countries, who have little el&s;e to do, are very a&s;&s;iduous in &s;pying out
the places where the parrot is &s;een to ne&s;tle, and generally come with
great joy to inform the Europeans, if there be any, of the di&s;covery. As
tho&s;e birds have always the greate&s;t docility that are taken young, &s;uch
a ne&s;t is often con&s;idered as worth taking &s;ome trouble to be
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of; and, for this purpo&s;e, the u&s;ual method of coming at
the young is, by cutting down the tree. In the fall of the tree it often
happens that the young parrots are killed; but if one of them &s;urvives the
&s;hock, it is con&s;idered as a &s;ufficient recompence.</P>
<P>Such is the avidity with which the&s;e birds are &s;ought when
young; for it is known they always &s;peak be&s;t when their ear has not been
anticipated by the har&s;h notes of the wild ones. But as the natives are not
able upon all occa&s;ions to &s;upply the demand for young ones, they are
contented to take the old; and for that purpo&s;e &s;hoot them in the woods
with heavy arrows, headed <PB N="280" REF="310"> with cotton, which knocks down
the bird with|out killing it. The parrots thus &s;tunned are car|ried home:
&s;ome die, but others recover, and, by kind u&s;age and plentiful food, become
talka|tive and noi&s;y.</P>
<P>But it is not for the &s;ake of their conver&s;ation alone that
the parrot is &s;ought after among the &s;avages; for, though &s;ome of them
are but tough and ill-ta&s;ted, yet there are other &s;orts, particularly of
the &s;mall parakeet tribe, that are very delicate food. In general it obtains,
that whatever fruit or grain the&s;e birds mo&s;tly feed upon, their fle&s;h
partakes of the flavour, and becomes good or ill ta&s;ted, according to the
quality of their particular diet. When the guava is ripe, they are at that
&s;ea&s;on fat and tender; if they feed upon the &s;eed of the acajou, their
fle&s;h contracts an agreeable flavour of garlick; if they feed upon the &s;eed
of the &s;picy trees, their fle&s;h then ta&s;tes of cloves and cinnamon;
while, on the contrary, it is in&s;upportably bitter if the berries they feed
on are of that quality. The &s;eed of the cotton-tree intoxicates them in the
&s;ame manner as wine does man; and even wine it&s;elf is drunk by parrots, as
Ari&s;totle a&s;&s;ures us, by which they are thus rendered more talkative and
amu&s;ing. But of all food, they are fonde&s;t of the carthamus, or ba&s;tard 
<PB N="281" REF="311"> &s;affron; which, though &s;trongly purgative to man,
agrees perfectly with their con&s;titution, and fattens them in a very &s;hort
time.</P>
<P>Of the parakeet kind in Bra&s;il, Labat a&s;&s;ures us, that
they are the mo&s;t beautiful in their plumage, and the mo&s;t talkative birds
in na|ture. They are very tame, and appear fond of mankind; they &s;eem
plea&s;ed with holding parley with him; they never have done; but while he
continues to talk, an&s;wer him, and appear re&s;olved to have the la&s;t word:
but they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of another quality which is &s;uffi|cient to put
an end to this a&s;&s;ociation: their fle&s;h is the mo&s;t delicate
imaginable, and highly e&s;teemed by tho&s;e who are fonder of indulging their
appetites than their ears. The fowler walks into the woods, where they keep in
abun|dance; but as they are green, and exactly the colour of the leaves among
which they &s;it, he only hears their prattle, without being able to &s;ee a
&s;ingle bird; he looks round him, &s;en&s;ible that his game is within
gun-&s;hot in abundance, but is mortified to the la&s;t degree that it is
im|po&s;&s;ible to &s;ee them. Unfortunately for the&s;e little animals, they
are re&s;tle&s;s and ever on the wing, &s;o that in flying from one tree to
another he has but too frequent opportunities of de|&s;troying them; for as
&s;oon as they have &s;tripped <PB N="282" REF="312"> the tree on which they
&s;ate of all its berries, &s;ome one of them flies off to another; and, if
that be found fit for the purpo&s;e, it gives a loud call, which all the re&s;t
re&s;ort to. That is the opportunity the fowler has long been waiting for; he
fires in among the flock while they are yet on the wing; and he &s;eldom fails
of bring|ing down a part of them. But it is &s;ingular enough to &s;ee them
when they find their com|panions fallen. They &s;et up a loud outcry, as if
they were chiding their de&s;troyer, and do not cea&s;e till they &s;ee him
preparing for a &s;econd charge.</P>
<P>But, though there are &s;o many motives for de&s;troying the&s;e
beautiful birds, they are in very great plenty; and in &s;ome countries on the
coa&s;t of Guinea, they are con&s;idered by the Negroes as their greate&s;t
tormentors. The flocks of parrots per&s;ecute them with their uncea&s;ing
&s;creaming; and devour whatever fruits they attempt to pro|duce by art in
their little gardens. In other places they are not &s;o de&s;tructive, but
&s;ufficiently common; and, indeed, there is &s;carce a country of the tropical
climates that has not many of the common kinds as well as &s;ame peculiarly its
own. Travellers have counted more than an hundred different kinds on the
continent of Africa only; there is one country in particular, 
<PB N="283" REF="313"> north of the Cape of Good Hope, which takes its name
from the multitude of parrots which are &s;een in its woods. There are white
parrots &s;een in the burning regions of Ethiopia; in the Ea&s;t-Indies, they
are of the large&s;t &s;ize; in South-America, they are docile and talkative;
in all the i&s;lands of the Pacific Sea and the Indian Ocean, they &s;warm in
great variety and abundance, and add to the &s;plendour of tho&s;e woods which
Nature has dre&s;&s;ed in eternal green.</P>
<P>So generally are the&s;e birds known at pre&s;ent, and &s;o
great is their variety, that nothing &s;eems more extraordinary than that there
was but one &s;ort of them known among the ancients, and that at a time when
they pretended to be ma&s;ters of the world. If nothing el&s;e could &s;erve to
&s;hew the vanity of a Roman's boa&s;t, the parrot-tribe might be an
in&s;tance, of which there are an hundred kinds now known, not one of which
naturally breeds in the countries that acknowledged the Roman power. The green
parakeet, with a red neck, was the fir&s;t of this kind that was brought into
Europe, and the only one that was known to the ancients from the time of
Alexander the Great to the age of Nero. This was brought from India; and when
afterwards the Romans began to &s;eek and <PB N="284" REF="314"> and rummage
through all their dominions, for new and unheard of luxuries, they at la&s;t
found out others in Gaganda, an i&s;land of Ethiopia, which they con&s;idered
as an extraordinary di&s;|covery.</P>
<P>Parrots have u&s;ually the &s;ame di&s;orders with other birds;
and they have one or two peculiar to their kind. They are &s;ometimes &s;truck
by a kind of apoplectic blow, by which they fall from their perches, and for a
while &s;eem ready to expire. The other is the growing of the beak, which
becomes &s;o very much hooked as to deprive them of the power of eating.
The&s;e infirmities, however, do not hinder them from being long-lived; for a
parrot well kept will live five or &s;ix and twenty years.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. The Pigeon and its Varieties.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is one of the birds which, from its great fecundity, we
have, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, reclaimed from a &s;tate of nature, and taught to
live in habits of dependance. Indeed, its fe|cundity &s;eems to be encrea&s;ed
by human culti|vation, &s;ince tho&s;e pigeons that live in a wild &s;tate, in
the woods, are by no means &s;o fruitful as tho&s;e in our pigeon-hou&s;es
nearer home. The power of encrea&s;e in mo&s;t birds depends upon the quantity
of their food; and it is &s;een, in more than one in&s;tance, that man, by
&s;up|plying food in plenty, and allowing the animal at the &s;ame time a
proper &s;hare of freedom, has brought &s;ome of tho&s;e kinds which are known
to lay but once a year, to become much more prolific.</P>
<P>The tame pigeon, and all its beautiful va|rieties, derive their
origin from one &s;pecies, the Stock Dove only, the Engli&s;h name, implying
its being the &s;tock or &s;tem from whence the other dome&s;tic kinds have
been propagated. This bird, in its natural &s;tate, is of a deep bluei&s;h
a&s;h colour; the brea&s;t da&s;hed with a fine change|able 
<PB N="286" REF="316"> green and purple; its wings marked with two black bars;
the back white, and the tail barred near the end with black. The&s;e are the
colours of the pigeon in a &s;tate of nature; and from the&s;e &s;imple tints
has man by art propa|gated a variety that words cannot de&s;cribe, nor even
fancy &s;ugge&s;t. However, Nature &s;till per&s;everes in her great out-line;
and though the form, colour, and even the fecundity of the&s;e birds may be
altered by art, yet their na|tural manners and inclinations continue &s;till
the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The &s;tock-dove, in its native woods, differs from the
ring-dove, a bird that has never been reclaimed, by its breeding in the holes
of rocks and the hollows of trees. All other birds of the pigeon-kind build
like rooks, in the topmo&s;t branches of the fore&s;t, and chu&s;e their
habitation as remote as po&s;&s;ible from man. But this &s;pe|cies &s;oon takes
to build in artificial cavities; and, from the temptation of a ready
provi&s;ion and numerous &s;ociety, ea&s;ily &s;ubmits to the ty|ranny of man.
Still, however, it pre&s;erves its native colour for &s;everal generations, and
becomes more variegated only in proportion as it removes from the original
&s;implicity of its co|louring in the woods.</P>
<P>The dove-hou&s;e pigeon, as is well known, <PB N="287" REF="317"> breeds every month; but then it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upply it with
food when the weather is &s;evere, or the fields are covered with &s;now. Upon
other occa&s;ions, it may be left to provide for it&s;elf; and it generally
repays the owner for his protection. The pigeon lays two white eggs, which
mo&s;t u&s;ually produce young ones of differ|ent &s;exes. For the laying of
each egg, it is nece&s;&s;ary to have a particular congre&s;s with the male;
and the egg is u&s;ually depo&s;ited in the afternoon. When the eggs are thus
laid, the female in the &s;pace of fifteen days, not including the three days
during which &s;he is employed in laying, continues to hatch, relieved at
intervals by the male. The turns are u&s;ually regulated with great
exactne&s;s. From three or four o'clock in the evening till nine the next day,
the female continues to &s;it; &s;he is then relieved by the male, who takes
his place from ten till three, while his mate is feeding abroad. In this manner
they &s;it alternately till the young are excluded. If, during this term, the
female de|lays to return at the expected time, the male follows, and drives her
to the ne&s;t; and, &s;hould he in his turn be dilatory, &s;he retaliates with
equal &s;everity.</P>
<P>The young ones when hatched require no food for the three
fir&s;t days, only wanting to <PB N="288" REF="318"> be kept warm, which is an
employment the female takes entirely upon her&s;elf. During this period, &s;he
never &s;tirs out, except for a few minutes to take a little food. From this
they are fed for eight or ten days, with corn or grain of different kinds,
which the old ones gather in the fields, and keep trea&s;ured up in their
crops, from whence they throw it up again into the mouths of their young ones
who very greedily demand it.</P>
<P>As this method of feeding the young from the crop is different
in birds of the pigeon-kind from all others, it demands a more detailed
explanation. Of all birds, for its &s;ize, the pigeon has the large&s;t crop,
which is al&s;o made in a manner quite peculiar to the kind. In two of the&s;e
that were di&s;&s;ected by a member of the Royal Academy of Sciences, it was
found that if the anatomi&s;t blew air into the wind-pipe, it di&s;tended the
crop or gullet to a pro|digious &s;ize. This was the more extraordinary as
there &s;eemed to be no communication what|&s;oever between the&s;e two
receptacles, as the conduit by which we breathe, as every one knows, leads to a
very different receptacle from that where we put our food. By what apertures
the air blown into the lungs of the pigeon makes its way into the crop, is
unknown; but <PB N="289" REF="319"> nothing is more certain than that the&s;e
birds have a power of filling the crop with air; and &s;ome of them, which are
called croppers, di&s;tend it in &s;uch a manner, that the bird's brea&s;t
&s;eems bigger than its body. The pe|culiar mechani&s;m of this part is not
well known; but the nece&s;&s;ity for it in the&s;e animals is pretty obvious.
The pigeon, as we all know, lives entirely upon grain and water: the&s;e are
mixed together in the crop; and in the ordinary way are dige&s;ted in
proportion as the bird lays in its provi&s;ion. But to feed its young, which
are very voracious, it is nece&s;&s;ary to lay in a &s;tore greater than
ordinary, and to give the food a kind of half maceration to &s;uit their tender
appetites. The heat of the bird's body, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by air and numerous
glands &s;e|parating a milky fluid, are the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary in&s;truments
for this operation; but, in propor|tion as the food macerates it begins to
&s;well al&s;o; and the crop mu&s;t of con&s;equence be con&s;iderably dilated.
Still, however, the air which is contained in it gives the bird a power of
contracting it at plea&s;ure; for if it were filled with more &s;olid
&s;ub&s;tances, the bird could have no power to compre&s;s it. But this is not
the ca&s;e, the bird can compre&s;s its crop at plea|&s;ure; and driving out
the air, can thus drive <PB N="290" REF="320"> out the food al&s;o, which is
forced up the gullet like a pellet from a pop-gun. The young ones open-mouthed
receive this tribute of affec|tion, and are thus fed three times a day. In
feeding, the male u&s;ually &s;upplies the young female; while the old female
&s;upplies the young of the oppo&s;ite &s;ex. The food with which they are
&s;upplied is more macerated in the beginning; but as they grow older, the
parents give it le&s;s preparation, and at la&s;t drive them out to &s;hift for
them&s;elves. When well fed, however, the old ones do not wait for the total
di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of their young; but, in the &s;ame ne&s;t, are to be found
young ones almo&s;t fit for flight, and eggs hatching, at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>The fidelity of the turtle-dove is proverbial, and makes the
u&s;ual compari&s;on of &s;uch poets as are content to repeat what others have
&s;aid before them; but the pigeon of the dove-hou&s;e is not &s;o faithful;
and, having been &s;ubjected to man, it puts on licentiou&s;ne&s;s among its
other dome&s;tic habits. Two males are often &s;een quarreling for the &s;ame
mi&s;tre&s;s; and when the female admits the addre&s;&s;es of a new gal|lant,
her old companion &s;eems to bear the con|tempt with &s;ome marks of
di&s;plea&s;ure, ab&s;tains from her company, or if he approaches, it is only
to cha&s;ti&s;e her. There have been in&s;tances when two males, being
di&s;plea&s;ed with their <PB N="291" REF="321"> re&s;pective mates, have
thought proper to make an exchange, and have lived in great harmony with their
new companions.</P>
<P>So great is the produce of this bird in its dome&s;tic &s;tate,
that near fifteen thou&s;and may in the &s;pace of four years be produced from
a &s;ingle pair. But the &s;tock-dove &s;eldom breeds above twice a year; for,
when the winter months come, the whole employment of the fond cou|ple is rather
for &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, than tran&s;|mitting a po&s;terity. They &s;eem,
however, to have a &s;tronger attachment to their young than tho&s;e who are
found to breed &s;o often; whe|ther it be that in&s;tinct acts more powerfully
upon them in their &s;tate of nature, or that their affections are le&s;s
divided by the multiplicity of claims.</P>
<P>It is from a &s;pecies of the&s;e, therefore, that tho&s;e
pigeons which are called Carriers, and are u&s;ed to convey letters, are
produced. The&s;e are ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed from all others by their eyes,
which are compa&s;&s;ed about with a broad circle of naked white &s;kin, and by
being of a dark blue or blacki&s;h colour. It is from their at|tachment to
their native place, and particularly where they have brought up their young,
that the&s;e birds are employed in &s;everal countries as the mo&s;t
expeditious carriers. They are fir&s;t <PB N="292" REF="322"> brought from the
place where they were bred, and whither it is intended to &s;end them back with
information. The letter is tied under the bird's wing, and it is then let
loo&s;e to return. The little animal no &s;ooner finds it&s;elf at liberty,
than its pa&s;&s;ion for its native &s;pot directs all its motions. It is
&s;een, upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, flying directly into the clouds to an amazing
height; and then, with the greate&s;t certainty and exactne&s;s, directing
it&s;elf by &s;ome &s;urpriz|ing in&s;tinct towards home, which lies
&s;ometimes at many miles di&s;tance, bringing its me&s;&s;age to tho&s;e to
whom it is directed. By what marks they di&s;cover the place, by what chart
they are guided in the right way, is to us utterly un|known; certain it is,
that in the &s;pace of an hour and an half they perform a journey of forty
miles; which is a degree of di&s;patch three times greater than the fleete&s;t
quadrupede can per|form. The&s;e birds are not brought up at pre|&s;ent with as
much care as formerly, when they were &s;ent from governors in a be&s;ieged
city to generals that were coming to relieve it without; when they were &s;ent
from princes to their &s;ubjects with the tidings of &s;ome fortunate event, or
from lovers to their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es with ex|pre&s;&s;ions of their
pa&s;&s;ion. The only u&s;e we now &s;ee made of them, is to be let fly at
Tyburn, when the cart is drawn away; pretty much as <PB N="293" REF="323"> when
&s;ome antient heroe was to be interred, an eagle was let off from the funeral
pile, to com|plete his apotheo&s;is.</P>
<P>The varieties of the tame pigeon are &s;o nu|merous, that it
would be a vain attempt to mention them: &s;o much is the figure and the colour
of this bird under human controul, that pigeon-fanciers, by coupling a male and
fe|male of different &s;orts, can breed them, as they expre&s;s it, to a
feather. From hence we have the various names of Croppers, Carriers,
Ja|cobines, Powters, Runts, and Turbits: all birds that at fir&s;t might have
accidentally va|ried from the &s;tock-dove; and then, by having the&s;e
varieties &s;till heightened by food, cli|mate and paring, different &s;pecies
have been produced. But there are many &s;pecies of the wild pigeon which,
though bearing a &s;trong affinity to the &s;tock-dove, are, neverthele&s;s,
&s;ufficiently different from it to de&s;erve a di&s;tinct de&s;cription. The
Ring-dove is of this num|ber; a good deal larger than the former, and building
its ne&s;t, with a few dry &s;ticks, in the boughs of trees. This &s;eems a
bird much fonder of its native freedom than the former; and attempts have been
frequently made to render it dome&s;tic: but they have hitherto proved
fruitle&s;s; for, though their eggs have <PB N="294" REF="324"> been hatched by
the tame pigeon in a dove-hou&s;e, yet, as &s;oon as they could fly, they
al|ways betook them&s;elves to the woods where they were fir&s;t produced. In
the beginning of winter, the&s;e a&s;&s;emble in great flocks in the woods, and
leave off cooing; nor do they re|&s;ume this note of court&s;hip till the
beginning of March, when the genial &s;ea&s;on, by &s;upply|ing them with food,
renews their de&s;ires.</P>
<P>The turtle-dove is a &s;maller, but a much &s;hyer, bird than
any of the former. It may ea&s;ily be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t by the
iris of the eye, which is of a fine yellow, and by a beautiful crim&s;on circle
that encompa&s;&s;es the eye-lids. The fidelity of the&s;e birds is noted; and
a pair being put in a cage, if one dies, the other will not &s;urvive it. The
turtle-dove is a bird of pa&s;&s;age, and few or none remain in our northern
climates in winter. They fly in flocks when they come to breed here in
&s;ummer, and delight in open, mountainous, &s;andy countries. But they build
their ne&s;ts in the mid&s;t of woods, and chu&s;e the mo&s;t retired
&s;ituations for incu|bation. They feed upon all &s;orts of grain, but are
fonde&s;t of millet-&s;eed.</P>
<P>To this &s;hort li&s;t might be added a long ca|talogue of
foreign pigeons, of which we know little more than the plumage and the names: 
<PB N="295" REF="325"> indeed, the variety of their plumage is as beau|tiful as
the names by which they are known are har&s;h and di&s;&s;onant. The
Ocotzimtzcan, for in&s;tance, is one of the mo&s;t &s;plendid tenants of the
Mexican fore&s;ts; but few, I believe, would de&s;ire to learn the name, only
to be in|formed that it is covered with purple, green, and yellow plumage. To
de&s;cribe &s;uch birds, the hi&s;torian's pen is not half &s;uch an u&s;eful
implement as the painter's pencil.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="299" REF="327">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of Birds of the Sparrow Kind in General.</HEAD>
<P>STILL de&s;cending from the larger to the &s;maller, we come to
birds of the &s;parrow kind; or that cla&s;s of beautiful little animals that,
being le&s;s than the pigeon, go on dimini&s;hing till we arrive at the
humming-bird, the &s;malle&s;t of the feathered creation.</P>
<P>The birds which compo&s;e this cla&s;s, chiefly live in the
neighbourhood of man, and are his greate&s;t favourites. The falcon may be more
e&s;teemed, and the turkey more u&s;eful; but the&s;e he con&s;iders as
&s;ervants, not as friends; as animals reclaimed merely to &s;upply him with
&s;ome of the conveniences of life: but the&s;e little painted &s;ong&s;ters
have his affections, as well from their beauty as their melody; it is this
delightful cla&s;s that fill his groves with harmony, and lift his heart to
&s;ympathize with their rap|tures. All the other cla&s;&s;es are either mute or
&s;creaming; it is this diminutive tribe only that have voices equal to the
beauty of their figures; equally adapted to rejoice man, and delight each
other.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="328">As they are the favourites of man, &s;o
they are chiefly &s;een near him. All the great birds dread his vicinity, and
keep to the thicke&s;t darkne&s;s of the fore&s;t, or the brow of the mo&s;t
craggy precipice: but the&s;e &s;eldom re&s;ort to the thicker parts of the
wood; they keep near its edges, in the neighbourhood of cultivated fields; in
the hedge-rows of farm-grounds; and even in the yard, mixing with the
poultry.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be owned, indeed, that their living near man is not a
&s;ociety of affection on their part, as they approach inhabited grounds merely
becau&s;e their chief provi&s;ion is to be found there. In the depth of the
de&s;art, or the gloom of the fore&s;t, there is no grain to be picked up; none
of the&s;e tender buds that are &s;o grateful to their appetites; in&s;ects,
them|&s;elves, that make &s;o great a part of their food, are not found there
in abundance; their natures being un&s;uited to the moi&s;ture of the place. As
we enter, therefore, deeper into uncultivated woods, the &s;ilence becomes more
profound; every thing carries the look of awful &s;tillne&s;s; there are none
of tho&s;e warblings, none of tho&s;e murmurs that awaken attention, as near
the habitations of men; there is nothing of that confu&s;ed buzz, formed by the
united though <PB N="301" REF="329"> di&s;tant voices of quadrupedes and birds;
but all is profoundly dead and &s;olemn. Now and then, indeed, the traveller
may be rouzed from this lethargy of life, by the voice of an heron, or the
&s;cream of an eagle; but his &s;weet little friends and warblers have totally
for&s;aken him.</P>
<P>There is &s;till another rea&s;on for the&s;e little birds
avoiding the depths of the fore&s;t; which is, that their mo&s;t formidable
enemies u&s;ually re&s;ide there. The greater birds, like robbers, chu&s;e the
mo&s;t dreary &s;olitudes for their re|treats; and, if they do not find they
make a de&s;art all around them. The &s;mall-birds fly from their tyranny, and
take protection in the vicinity of man, where they know their more unmerciful
foes will not venture to pur&s;ue them.</P>
<P>All birds, even tho&s;e of pa&s;&s;age, &s;eem con|tent with a
certain di&s;trict to provide food and center in. The red-brea&s;t or the wren
&s;eldom leaves the field where it has been brought up, or where its young have
been excluded; even though hunted it flies along the hedge, and &s;eems fond of
the place with an imprudent per|&s;everance. The fact is, all the&s;e &s;mall
birds mark out a territory to them&s;elves, which they will permit none of
their own &s;pecies to remain in; they guard their dominions with the mo&s;t 
<PB N="302" REF="330"> watchful re&s;entment; and we &s;eldom find two male
tenants in the &s;ame hedge together.</P>
<P>Thus, though fitted by nature for the mo&s;t wandering life,
the&s;e little animals do not make &s;uch di&s;tant excur&s;ions, during the
&s;ea&s;on of their &s;tay, as the &s;tag or the leveret. Food &s;eems to be
the only object that puts them in motion, and when that is provided for them in
&s;ufficient plenty they never wander. But as that is &s;eldom permanent
through the year, almo&s;t every bird is then obliged to change its abode. Some
are called birds of pa&s;&s;age, be|cau&s;e they are obliged to take long
journeys for this purpo&s;e; but, &s;trictly &s;peaking, almo&s;t every other
kind are birds of pa&s;&s;age, though their migration may not be to places &s;o
re|mote. At &s;ome particular &s;ea&s;on of the year, all &s;mall birds migrate
either from one county to another, or from the more inland provinces towards
the &s;hore.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal per&s;ons who get a livelihood by watching
the &s;ea&s;ons when our &s;mall birds begin to migrate from one county to
another, and by taking them with nets in their pa&s;&s;age. The birds are found
to fly, as the bird-catchers term it, chiefly during the month of October, and
part of September and November. There is al&s;o another flight in March, which
is much le&s;s con&s;iderable than that in autumn. <PB N="303" REF="331"> Nor
is it le&s;s remarkable, that &s;everal of the&s;e &s;pecies of flight-birds
make their appearance in regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The pippit, for in&s;tance,
begins its flight every year about Michaelmas, when they are caught in
greate&s;t number. To this the wood-lark &s;ucceeds, and continues its flight
till towards the middle of October; other birds follow, but are not &s;o
punctually perio|dical; the green-finch does not begin till the fro&s;t obliges
it to &s;eek for a change. The&s;e birds, during tho&s;e months, fly from
day-break till twelve at noon; and there is afterwards a &s;mall flight from
two till night. Such are the &s;ea&s;ons of the migration of the birds, which
have been u&s;ually con&s;idered as &s;tationary, and on the&s;e occa&s;ions
they are caught in great abun|dance, as they are on their journey. But the
&s;ame arts u&s;ed to allure them upon other occa|&s;ions would be utterly
fruitle&s;s, as they avoid the nets with the mo&s;t prudent circum&s;pection.
The autumnal flight probably con&s;i&s;ts of the parents conducting their
new-fledged young to tho&s;e places where there is &s;ufficient provi&s;ion,
and a proper temperament of the air during the winter &s;ea&s;on; and their
return in &s;pring is ob|viou&s;ly from an attachment to the place which was
found &s;o convenient before for the purpo&s;es of ne&s;tling and
incubation.</P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="332">Autumn is the principal &s;ea&s;on when
the bird-catcher employs his art to catch the&s;e wan|derers. His nets are a
mo&s;t ingenious piece of mechani&s;m, being generally twelve yards and a half
long, and two yards and a half wide, and &s;o contrived as from a flat
po&s;ition to ri&s;e on each &s;ide, and clap over the birds that are de|coyed
to come between them. The birds in their pa&s;&s;age are always ob&s;erved to
fly again&s;t the wind; hence there is a great contention among the
bird-catchers which &s;hall gain the wind; for example, if it is we&s;terly,
the bird-catcher who lays his nets mo&s;t to the ea&s;t, is &s;ure of the
mo&s;t plentiful &s;port if his call-birds are good. For this purpo&s;e, he
generally car|ries five or &s;ix linnets, two gold-finches, two green-finches,
one wood-lark, one red-poll, and perhaps a bull-finch, a yellow-hammer, a
tit-lark, and an aberdavine: the&s;e are placed at &s;mall di&s;tances from the
nets in little cages. He has be&s;ides what he calls his flur-birds, which are
placed upon a moveable perch, which the bird-catcher can rai&s;e at plea&s;ure
by means of a &s;tring; and the&s;e he always lifts gently up and down as the
wild bird approaches. But this is not enough to allure the wild bird down; it
mu&s;t be called by one of the call-birds in the cages; and the&s;e, by being
made to moult pre|maturely <PB N="305" REF="333"> in a warm cage, call louder
and better than tho&s;e that are wild and at freedom. There even appears a
malicious joy in the&s;e call-birds to bring the wild ones into the &s;ame
&s;tate of captivity, while at the &s;ame time their call is louder and their
plumage brighter than in a &s;tate of nature. Nor is their &s;ight or hearing
le&s;s exqui&s;ite, far exceeding that of the bird-catcher; for the in&s;tant
the wild birds are per|ceived, notice is given by one to the re&s;t of the
call-birds, who all unite in the &s;ame tumultuous ec&s;tacy of plea&s;ure. The
call-birds do not &s;ing upon the&s;e occa&s;ions as a bird does in a chamber,
but incite the wild ones by &s;hort jerks, which, when the birds are good, may
be heard at a great di&s;tance. The allurement of this call is &s;o great, that
the wild bird hearing it is &s;topped in its mo&s;t rapid flight; and, if not
already ac|quainted with the nets, lights boldly within twenty yards perhaps of
the bird-catcher, and on a &s;pot which it would otherwi&s;e have quite
di&s;regarded. This is the opportunity wi&s;hed for, and the bird-catcher
pulling a &s;tring, the nets on each &s;ide ri&s;e in an in&s;tant, and clap
di|rectly down on the poor little un&s;u&s;pecting vi|&s;itant. Nay, it
frequently happens that if half a flock only are caught, the remaining half
will immediately afterwards light between the nets, <PB N="306" REF="334"> and
&s;hare the fate of their companions. Should only one bird e&s;cape, this
unhappy &s;urvivor will al&s;o venture into danger till it is caught; &s;uch a
fa&s;cinating power have the call-birds.</P>
<P>Indeed, it is not ea&s;y to account for the nature of this call,
whether it be a challenge to combat, an invitation to food, or a prelude to
court&s;hip. As the call-birds are all males, and as the wild birds that attend
to their voice are mo&s;t frequently males al&s;o, it does not &s;eem that love
can have any influence in their a&s;&s;iduity. Perhaps the wild females, in
the&s;e flights, attend to and obey the call below, and their male companions
of the flight come down to bear them company. If this be the ca&s;e, and that
the females have unfaithfully led their mates into the nets, they are the
fir&s;t that are puni&s;hed for their infidelity; the males are only made
captives for &s;inging; while the females are indi&s;criminately killed, and
&s;old to be &s;erved up to the tables of the delicate.</P>
<P>Whatever be the motives that thus arre&s;t a flock of birds in
their flight, whether they be of gallantry or of war, it is certain that the
&s;mall birds are equally remarkable for both. It is, perhaps, the genial
de&s;ire that in|&s;pires the courage of mo&s;t animals; and that being
greate&s;t in the males, gives them a <PB N="307" REF="335"> greater degree of
valour than the females. Small birds, being extremely amorous, are re|markably
brave. However contemptible the&s;e little warriors are to larger creatures,
they are often but too formidable to each other; and &s;ometimes fight till one
of them yields up his life with the vlctory. But their contentions are
&s;ometimes of a gentler nature. Two male birds &s;hall &s;trive in &s;ong
till, after a long &s;truggle, the loude&s;t &s;hall entirely &s;ilence the
other. During the&s;e contentions, the female &s;its an attentive &s;ilent
auditor, and often re|wards the loude&s;t &s;ong&s;ter with her company during
the &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>Singing among birds is almo&s;t univer&s;ally the prerogative of
the male. With them it is the rever&s;e of what occurs in the human kind. Among
the feathered tribe, the heavie&s;t cares of life fall to the lot of the
female. Hers is the fatigue of incubation, and to her devolves the principal
fatigue of nur&s;ing the helple&s;s brood. To alleviate the&s;e fatigues, and
to &s;upport her under them, Nature has given the &s;ong to the male. This
&s;erves as a note of blandi&s;hment at fir&s;t to attract her affections; it
&s;erves as a note to delight her during the time of her incubation; but it
&s;erves &s;till farther as a note of &s;ecurity, to a&s;&s;ure her that no
danger threatens <PB N="308" REF="336"> to mole&s;t her. The male, while his
mate is hatching, &s;its upon &s;ome neighbouring tree, continuing at once to
watch and to &s;ing. While his voice is heard, the female re&s;ts in confident
&s;ecurity; and, as the poet expre&s;&s;es it, appears 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed when mo&s;t
un&s;een:</HI></Q> But if any appearance of danger offers to intrude, the male,
that a moment before was &s;o loud and &s;portive, &s;tops all of a &s;udden;
and this is a mo&s;t certain &s;ignal to his mate to provide for her own
&s;ecurity.</P>
<P>The ne&s;t of little birds &s;eems to be of a more delicate
contrivance than that of the larger kinds. As the volume of their bodies is
&s;maller, the materials of which their ne&s;ts are compo&s;ed are generally
warmer. It is ea&s;y to conceive that &s;mall things keep heat a &s;horter time
than tho&s;e that are large. The eggs, therefore, of &s;mall birds require a
place of more con&s;tant warmth than tho&s;e of great ones, as being liable to
cool more quickly; and accordingly their ne&s;ts are built warmer and deeper,
lined on the in&s;ide with &s;ofter &s;ub&s;tances, and guarded above with a
better covering. But it &s;ometimes happens that the little archi|tects are
di&s;turbed in their operations, and then they are obliged to make a ne&s;t;
not &s;uch as they wi&s;h, but &s;uch as they can. The bird, 
<PB N="309" REF="337"> who&s;e ne&s;t has been robbed &s;everal times, builds
up her la&s;t in a very &s;lovenly manner, con&s;cious that, from the near
approach of winter, &s;he mu&s;t not take time to give her habitation every
po&s;&s;ible advantage it is capable of receiving. When the ne&s;t is
fini&s;hed, nothing can exceed the cunning which the male and female em|ploy to
conceal it. If it is built in bu&s;hes, the pliant branches are &s;o
di&s;po&s;ed as to hide it entirely from the view; if it be built among mo&s;s,
nothing outwardly appears to &s;hew that there is an habitation within. It is
always built near tho&s;e places where food is found in greate&s;t abundance;
and they take care never to go in or out while there is any one in &s;ight. The
greater birds continue from their ne&s;t for &s;ome time, as their eggs take no
damage in their ab&s;ence; but the little birds are a&s;&s;iduous while they
&s;it, and the ne&s;t is always occupied by the male when the female is obliged
to &s;eek for &s;u&s;tenance.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t food of all birds of the &s;parrow kind is worms and
in&s;ects. Even the &s;parrow and the gold-finch, that when adult feed only
upon grain, have both been fed upon in&s;ects while in the ne&s;t. The young
ones, for &s;ome time after their exclu&s;ion from the &s;hell, require no
food; but the parent &s;oon finds by their chirping <PB N="310" REF="338"> and
gaping that they begin to feel the ap|proaches of hunger, and flies to provide
them a plentiful &s;upply. In her ab&s;ence, they con|tinue to lie clo&s;e
together, and cheri&s;h each other by their mutual warmth. During this interval
al&s;o, they pre&s;erve a perfect &s;ilence, uttering not the &s;lighte&s;t
note till the parent returns. Her arrival is always announced by a chirrup,
which they perfectly under&s;tand, and which they an&s;wer all together, each
petitioning for its portion. The parent di&s;tributes a &s;upply to each by
turns, cautiou&s;ly avoiding to gorge them, but to give them often though
little at a time. The wren will in this manner feed &s;eventeen or eighteen
young ones, without pa&s;|&s;ing over one of them.</P>
<P>Such is the manner in which the&s;e birds bring forth and hatch
their young; but it yet remains to u&s;her them from the ne&s;t into life, and
this they very a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly perform. When they are fully fledged, and
fitted for &s;hort flights, the old ones, if the weather be fair, lead them a
few yards from the ne&s;t, and then compel them to return. For two or three
&s;ucceeding days they are led out in the &s;ame manner, but each day to &s;eek
more di&s;tant adventures. When it is per|ceived that they can fly, and &s;hift
for them&s;elves, then the parents for&s;ake them for ever, and 
<PB N="311" REF="339"> pay them no more attention than they do to other birds
in the &s;ame flock. Indeed, it would &s;eem among the&s;e little animals that,
from the moment their young are &s;et out, all future con|nexion cea&s;es
between the male and female; they go &s;eparate ways, each to provide for
it&s;elf, during the rigours of winter; and, at the approach of &s;pring, each
&s;eeks for a new a&s;&s;o|ciate.</P>
<P>In general, birds, when they come to pair in &s;pring,
a&s;&s;ociate with tho&s;e of their own age and place of abode. Their
&s;trength or courage is generally in proportion to their age; the olde&s;t
females fir&s;t feel the acce&s;&s;es of de&s;ire, and the olde&s;t males are
the bolde&s;t to drive off all younger pretenders. Tho&s;e next in courage and
de&s;ire, become pretenders, till they are al|mo&s;t all provided in turn. The
younge&s;t come la&s;t; as, in fact, they are the late&s;t in their
inclinations. But &s;till there are &s;everal, both males and females, that
remain unprovided for; either not happening to meet with each other, or at
lea&s;t not during the genial interval. Whether the&s;e mix with &s;mall birds
of a dif|ferent &s;pecies, is a doubt which naturali&s;ts have not been able
thoroughly to re&s;olve. Addi&s;on, in &s;ome beautiful Latin lines, in&s;erted
in the Spectator, is entirely of opinion that birds <PB N="312" REF="340">
ob&s;erve a &s;trict cha&s;tity of manners, and never admit the care&s;&s;es of
a different tribe.</P>
<Q> 
<L>Cha&s;te are their in&s;tincts, faithful is their fire,</L> 
<L>No foreign beauty tempts to fal&s;e de&s;ire:</L> 
<L>The &s;now-white ve&s;ture, and the glittering crown,</L> 
<L>The &s;imple plumage, or the glo&s;&s;y down,</L> 
<L>Prompt not their love. The patriot bird pur&s;ues</L> 
<L>His well acquainted tints, and kindred hues.</L> 
<L>Hence through their tribes no mix'd polluted flame,</L> 
<L>No mon&s;ter breed to mark the groves with &s;hame:</L> 
<L>But the cha&s;te blackbird, to its partner true,</L> 
<L>Thinks black alone is beauty's favourite hue:</L> 
<L>The nightingale, with mutual pa&s;&s;ion ble&s;t,</L> 
<L>Sings to its mate, and nightly charms the ne&s;t:</L> 
<L>While the dark owl, to court his partner flies,</L> 
<L>And owns his offspring in their yellow eyes.</L></Q>
<P>But whatever may be the poet's opinion, the probability is
again&s;t this fidelity among the &s;maller tenants of the grove. The great
birds are much more true to their &s;pecies than the&s;e; and, of
con&s;equence, the varieties among them are more few. Of the o&s;trich, the
ca&s;&s;owary, and the eagle, there are but few &s;pecies; and no arts that man
can u&s;e, could probably induce them to mix with each other.</P>
<P>But it is otherwi&s;e with the &s;mall birds we are
de&s;cribing; it requires very little trouble to make a &s;pecies between a
goldfinch and <PB N="313" REF="341"> a canary-bird, between a linnet and a
lark. They breed frequently together; and produce a race not, like the mules
among quadru|pedes, incapable of breeding again; for this motley mixture are as
fruitful as their pa|rents. What is &s;o ea&s;ily done by art, very probably
often happens in a &s;tate of nature; and when the male cannot find a mate of
his own &s;pecies, he flies to one of another, that, like him, has been left
out in pairing. This &s;ome hi&s;torians think may have given ri&s;e to the
great variety of &s;mall birds that are &s;een among us; &s;ome uncommon
mixture might fir&s;t have formed a new &s;pecies, and this might have been
continued down, by birds of this &s;pecies chu|&s;ing to breed together.</P>
<P>Whether the great variety of our &s;mall birds may have ari&s;en
from this &s;ource, cannot now be a&s;certained; but certain it is, that they
re|&s;emble each other very &s;trongly, not only in their form and plumage, but
al&s;o in their ap|petites and manner of living. The goldfinch, the linnet, and
the yellow-hammer, though obviou&s;ly of different &s;pecies, yet lead a very
&s;imilar life; being equally an active, lively, &s;alacious tribe, that
&s;ub&s;i&s;t by petty thefts upon the labours of mankind, and repay them with
a &s;ong. Their ne&s;ts bear a &s;imilitude; and <PB N="312" REF="342">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"> <PB N="313" REF="343">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"> <PB N="314" REF="344"> they are
all about the &s;ame time in hatching their young, which is u&s;ually fifteen
days. Were I therefore to de&s;cribe the manners of the&s;e with the &s;ame
minutene&s;s that I have done the greater birds, I &s;hould only pre&s;ent the
reader with a repetition of the &s;ame accounts; animated neither by novelty
nor information. In&s;tead, therefore, of &s;pecifying each &s;ort, I will
throw them into groupes; uniting tho&s;e together that practi&s;e the &s;ame
manners, or that are remarkable for &s;imilar qualifications.</P>
<P>Willaughby has divided all the &s;maller birds into tho&s;e that
have &s;lender bills, and tho&s;e that have &s;hort and thick bills. Tho&s;e
with &s;lender bills, chiefly live upon in&s;ects; tho&s;e with &s;hort,
&s;trong bills, live mo&s;tly upon fruits and grain. Among &s;lender billed
birds, he enumerates the thru&s;h, the blackbird, the fieldfare, the
&s;tarling, the lark, the titmou&s;e, the water-wagtail, the nightingale, the
red-&s;tart, the robin red-brea&s;t, the beccafigo, the &s;tone-chatter, the
whinchat, the goldfinch, the white-throat, the hedge-&s;parrow, the pettichaps,
the golden crowned wren, the wren, the humming-bird, and &s;everal other
&s;mall birds of the &s;parrow kind, unknown in this part of the world.</P>
<P>All the&s;e, as was &s;aid, live for the mo&s;t part 
<PB N="315" REF="345"> upon in&s;ects; and are con&s;equently of particular
benefit to man. By the&s;e are his grounds cleared of the pernicious &s;warms
of vermin that devour the budding leaves and flowers; and that even attack the
root it&s;elf, before ever the vegetable can come to maturity. The&s;e &s;eek
for and de&s;troy the eggs of in&s;ects that would otherwi&s;e propagate in
numbers beyond the arts of man to extirpate: they know better than man where to
&s;eek for them; and thus at once &s;atisfy their own appetites, and render him
the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential &s;ervices.</P>
<P>But this is not the only merit of this tribe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> in it we have the &s;weete&s;t
&s;ong&s;ters of the grove; their notes are &s;ofter, and their manner more
mu&s;ically &s;oothing than tho&s;e of hard billed birds. The foremo&s;t in
mu&s;ical fame are, the nightingale, the thru&s;h, the blackbird, the lark, the
red-brea&s;t, the black-cap, and the wren.</P>
<P>Birds of the &s;parrow kind, with thick and &s;hort bills, are
the gro&s;sbeak, the greenfinch, the bullfinch, the cro&s;sbill, the
hou&s;e-&s;parrow, the chaffinch, the brambling, the goldfinch, the linnet, the
&s;i&s;kin, the bunting, the yellow-hammer, the ortolan, the wheat-ear, and
&s;everal other foreign birds, of which we know rathe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> the names than the hi&s;tory. The&s;e chiefly feed upon
fruits, grain, and corn. They are often <PB N="316" REF="346"> trouble&s;ome to
man, as they are a numerous tribe: the harve&s;t often &s;uffers from their
de|predations; and while they are driven off from one end of the field, they
fly round, and come in at the other. But the&s;e al&s;o have their u&s;es: they
are frequently the di&s;tributors of &s;eeds into different di&s;tricts:
tho&s;e grains which they &s;wallow, are &s;ometimes, not wholly dige&s;ted;
and the&s;e, laid upon a &s;oil congenial to them, embelli&s;h the face of
nature with that agreeable variety which art but vainly attempts to imitate.
The mi&s;letoe plant, which we often &s;ee growing on the tops of elm and other
trees, has been thought to be propagated in this manner; yet, as it is often
&s;een growing on the under &s;ide of the branch, and &s;ometimes on a
perpendicular &s;hoot, it &s;eems extraordinary how a &s;eed could be
depo&s;ited in that &s;ituation. However this be, there are many plants
propagated from the depo&s;itions of birds; and &s;ome &s;eeds are thought to
thrive the better, for fir&s;t having undergone a kind of maceration in the
&s;tomach of the little animal, before it is voided on the ground.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome agreeable &s;ong&s;ters in this tribe al&s;o;
and tho&s;e who like a loud piercing pipe, endued with great variety and
per&s;e|verance, will be plea&s;ed mo&s;t with their &s;inging. The
&s;ong&s;ters of this cla&s;s are the canary-bird, <PB N="317" REF="347"> the
linnet, the chaffinch, the goldfinch, the greenfinch, the bullfinch, the
brambling, the &s;i&s;kin, and the yellow-hammer. The note of the&s;e is not
&s;o generally plea&s;ing as that of the &s;oft billed bird, but it u&s;ually
holds longer; and, in a cage, the&s;e birds are more ea&s;ily fed, and
hardy.</P>
<P>This cla&s;s of &s;mall birds, like all the greater, has its
wanderers, that leave us for a &s;ea&s;on, and then return, to propagate, to
&s;ing, or to embelli&s;h the land&s;cape here. Some of this &s;maller kind,
indeed, are called birds of pa&s;&s;age, that do not properly come under the
denomination; for though they di&s;appear in one place, they never leave the
kingdom, but are &s;een &s;omewhere el&s;e. But there are many among them, that
take longer flights, and go to a region colder or warmer, as it &s;uits their
con&s;titutions. The field-fare and the red-wing breed, pa&s;s their &s;ummers
in Norway, and other cold countries, and are tempted hi|ther to our mild
winters, and to tho&s;e various berries which then abound with us, and make
their principal food. The hawfinch and the cro&s;sbill are uncertain
vi&s;itants, and have no &s;tated times of migration. Swallows of every
&s;pecies di&s;appear at the approach of winter. The nightingale, the
black-cap, the fly-catcher, <PB N="318" REF="348"> the willow-wren, the
wheat-ear, the whin-chat, and the &s;tone-chatter, leave us long before the
approach of winter; while the &s;i&s;kin and the linnet only for&s;ake us when
our winters are more than u&s;ually &s;evere. All the re&s;t of the &s;maller
tribe never quit this country; but &s;up|port the &s;evere&s;t rigours of the
climate.</P>
<P>Yet it mu&s;t not be &s;uppo&s;ed that the manners of our little
birds prevail in all other countries; and that &s;uch kinds as are &s;tationary
with us, never wander in other parts of Europe: on the contrary, it happens
that many of tho&s;e kinds which are birds of pa&s;&s;age in England, are
&s;een, in other places, never to depart, but to make one country their fixed
re&s;idence, the whole year round. It is al&s;o frequent, that &s;ome birds,
which with us are faithful re&s;idents, in other kingdoms put on the nature of
birds of pa&s;&s;age, and di&s;appear for a &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>The &s;wallow, that with us is particularly re|marked for being
a bird of pa&s;&s;age, in Upper Egypt, and in the i&s;land of Java, breeds and
continues the whole year, without ever di&s;ap|pearing. Larks, that remain with
us the year throughout, are birds of pa&s;&s;age in Sweden; and for&s;ake that
climate in winter, to return again with the returning &s;pring. The chaffinch,
that with us is &s;tationary, appears during the <PB N="319" REF="349"> winter
in Carolina and Virginia; but di&s;appears totally in &s;ummer, to breed in the
more north|ern regions. In Sweden al&s;o, the&s;e little birds are &s;een
returning, at the approach of &s;pring, from the warmer climates, to
pro|pagate; which being accompli&s;hed by the latter end of autumn, the males
and females &s;eparate; the males to continue among their native &s;nows, the
females to &s;eek a warmer and gentler winter. On this occa&s;ion, they are
&s;een in flocks, that darken all the air, without a &s;ingle male among them,
making their way into the more &s;outhern regions of Denmark, Germany, and
Holland. In this amazon-like retreat, thou&s;ands fall by the way; &s;ome by
fatigue, &s;ome by want; but the greate&s;t num|ber by the nets of the fowler;
the taking them being one of the chief amu&s;ements among the gentry where they
pa&s;s. In &s;hort, the change of country with all this little tribe, is rather
a pilgrimage than a journey; a migra|tion rather of nece&s;&s;ity than of
choice.</P>
<P>Having thus given a general idea of the birds of this cla&s;s,
it will be proper to give &s;ome account of the mo&s;t remarkable among
them.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the Thru&s;h and its Affinities.</HEAD>
<P>WITH the thru&s;h we may rank the red-wing, the field-fare, the
black-bird, the ring-ouzel, and the water-ouzel.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the large&s;t of the &s;parrow-kind, and may be
di&s;tingui&s;hed from all others of this cla&s;s, as well by their &s;ize,
which is well known, as by their bills, which are a little bending at the
point; a &s;mall notch near the end of the upper chap, and the outmo&s;t toe
adhering as far as the fir&s;t joint of the middle toe. To this tribe may be
al&s;o added the &s;tare or &s;tarling, which, though with a flat bill, too
much re&s;em|bles the&s;e birds to be placed any where el&s;e.</P>
<P>The mi&s;&s;el-thru&s;h is di&s;tingui&s;hed from all of the
kind by its &s;uperior &s;ize, being much larger than any of them. It differs
&s;carcely in any other re&s;pect from the thro&s;tle, except that the &s;pots
on the brea&s;t are larger. It builds its ne&s;t in bu&s;hes, or on the &s;ide
of &s;ome tree, as all of this kind are found to do, and lays four or five eggs
in a &s;ea&s;on. Its &s;ong is very fine, which it begins in &s;pring,
&s;itting on the &s;ummit of a high tree. It is the large&s;t bird of all the 
<PB N="321" REF="351"> feathered tribe that has mu&s;ic in its voice; the note
of all greater birds being either &s;creaming, chattering, or croaking. It
feeds on in&s;ects, holly, and mi&s;letoe-berries; and &s;ometimes &s;ends
forth a very di&s;agreeable &s;cream when frighted or di&s;turbed.</P>
<P>The black-bird, which in cold countries, and particularly upon
the Alps, is &s;ometimes &s;een all over white, is a beautiful and a canorous
bird, whi&s;tling all the &s;pring and &s;ummer-time with a note at a
di&s;tance the mo&s;t plea&s;ing of all the grove. It is the deepe&s;t toned
warbler of the woods; but it is rather unplea&s;ant in a cage, being loud and
deafening. It lays four or five blui&s;h eggs, in a ne&s;t u&s;ually built at
the &s;tump of &s;ome old hawthorn, well plai&s;tered on the in&s;ide with
clay, &s;traw, and hair.</P>
<P>Plea&s;ing, however, as this bird may be, the blue-bird,
de&s;cribed by Bellonius, is in every re&s;pect far &s;uperior. This beautiful
animal en|tirely re&s;embles a black-bird in all but its blue colour. It lives
in the highe&s;t parts of the Alps, and even there chu&s;es the mo&s;t craggy
rocks and the mo&s;t frightful precipices for its re&s;idence. As it is rarely
caught, it is in high e&s;timation even in the countries where it breeds, but
&s;till more valuable when carried from home. It not only whi&s;tles in the
mo&s;t delight|ful <PB N="322" REF="352"> manner, but &s;peaks with an
articulate di|&s;tinct voice. It is &s;o docile, and ob&s;erves all things with
&s;uch diligence, that, though waked at midnight by any of the family, it will
&s;peak and whi&s;tle at the word of command. Its co|lour, about the beginning
of winter, from blue becomes black, which changes to its original hue on the
fir&s;t approaches of &s;pring. It makes its ne&s;t in deep holes, in very high
and inacce&s;|&s;ible &s;olitudes, and removes it not only from the
acce&s;&s;es of man, but al&s;o hides it with &s;urprizing cunning from the
&s;hammoy, and other wild bea&s;ts that might annoy its young.</P>
<P>The manner of taking this beautiful bird is &s;aid to be this.
The fowlers, either by chance or by lying in wait, having found out the place
where it builds, take with them a &s;trong &s;tilt or &s;take, &s;uch as the
climbers of rocks make u&s;e of to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in their a&s;cent. With
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of this, they mount where an indif|ferent &s;pectator
would think it impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;cend, covering their heads at the &s;ame
time to ward off any danger of the falling of pebbles or &s;tones from above.
At length, with extreme toil and danger, having arrived at the ne&s;t, they
draw it up from the hole in which it is u&s;ually buried, and cheri&s;h the
young with an a&s;&s;iduity equal to the pains they took to obtain them. It 
<PB N="323" REF="353"> produces for the mo&s;t part five young, and never more;
it &s;eldom de&s;cends into the plain country; flies &s;wifter than a
black-bird, and u&s;es the &s;ame food.</P>
<P>The field-fare and the red-wing make but a &s;hort &s;tay in
this country. With us they are in&s;ipid tunele&s;s birds, flying in flocks,
and ex|ce&s;&s;ively watchful to pre&s;erve the general &s;afety. All their
&s;ea&s;on of mu&s;ic and plea&s;ure is em|ployed in the more northern
climates, where they &s;ing mo&s;t delightfully, perched among the fore&s;ts of
maples, with which tho&s;e countries abound. They build their ne&s;ts in
hedges; and lay &s;ix blui&s;h green eggs &s;potted with black.</P>
<P>The Stare, di&s;tingui&s;hable from the re&s;t of this tribe by
the glo&s;&s;y green of its feathers, in &s;ome lights, and the purple in
others, breeds in hol|low trees, eaves of hou&s;es, towers, ruins, cliffs, and
often in high rocks over the &s;ea. It lays four or five eggs of a pale
greeni&s;h a&s;h-colour; and makes it ne&s;t of &s;traw, &s;mall fibres of
roots, and &s;uch like. Its voice is rougher than the re&s;t of this kind; but
what it wants in the me|lody of its note, it compen&s;ates by the facility with
which it is taught to &s;peak. In winter the&s;e birds a&s;&s;emble in va&s;t
flocks, and feed upon worms and in&s;ects. At the approach of &s;pring, they
a&s;&s;emble in fields, as if in con|&s;ultation <PB N="324" REF="354">
together, and for three or four days &s;eem to take no nouri&s;hment: the
greater part leave the country; the re&s;t breed here and bring up their
young.</P>
<P>To this tribe might be added above an hun|dred other birds of
nearly the thru&s;h &s;ize, and living like them upon fruit and berries. Words
could not afford variety enough to de&s;cribe all the beautiful tints that
adorn the foreign birds of the thru&s;h kind. The brilliant green of the
emerald, the flaming red of the ruby, the purple of the amethy&s;t, or the
bright blue of the &s;a|phire, could not by the mo&s;t artful combi|nation
&s;hew any thing &s;o truely lively or de|lightful to the &s;ight as the
feathers of the chil|coqui or the tautotol. Pa&s;&s;ing, therefore, over
the&s;e beautiful, but little known, birds, I will only mention the American
mock-bird, the favourite &s;ong&s;ter of a region where the birds excel rather
in the beauty of their plumage than the &s;weetne&s;s of their notes.</P>
<P>This valuable bird does not &s;eem to vie with the feathered
inhabitants of that country in the beauty of its plumage, content with
qua|lifications that endear it to mankind much more. It is but a plain bird to
the eye, about the &s;ize of a thru&s;h, of a white and grey colour, and a
reddi&s;h bill. It is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not only of its own 
<PB N="325" REF="355"> natural notes, which are mu&s;ical and &s;olemn, but it
can a&s;&s;ume the tone of every other animal in the wood, from the wolf to the
raven. It &s;eems even to &s;port it&s;elf in leading them a&s;tray. It will at
one time allure the le&s;&s;er birds with the call of their males, and then
terrify them when they have come near with the &s;creams of the eagle. There is
no bird in the fore&s;t but it can mimick; and there is none that it has not at
times deceived by its call. But, not like &s;uch as we u&s;ually &s;ee famed
for mimicking with us, and who have no particular merit of their own, the mock
bird is ever &s;ure&s;t to plea&s;e when it is mo&s;t it&s;elf. At tho&s;e
times it u&s;ually frequents the hou&s;es of the American planters; and,
&s;itting all night on the chimney-top, pours forth the &s;weete&s;t and the
mo&s;t various notes of any bird whatever. It would &s;eem, if accounts be
true, that the deficiency of mo&s;t other &s;ong-birds in that country is made
up by this bird alone. They often build their ne&s;ts in the fruit-trees about
hou&s;es, feed upon berries and other fruits, and are ea&s;ily rendered
dome&s;tic.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of the Nightingale and other &s;oft billed
Song-Birds.</HEAD>
<P>THE Nightingale is not only famous among the moderns for its
&s;inging, but almo&s;t every one of the ancients who undertook to de&s;cribe
beautiful nature, has contributed to rai&s;e its reputation. 
<Q REND="inline">"The nightingale," &s;ays Pliny, "that, for
fifteen days and nights hid in the thicke&s;t &s;hades, continues her note
without intermi&s;&s;ion, de&s;erves our attention and won|der. How
&s;urpri&s;ing that &s;o great a voice can re&s;ide in &s;o &s;mall a body!
&s;uch per&s;ever|ance in &s;o minute an animal! With what a mu&s;ical
propriety are the &s;ounds it produces modulated! The note at one time drawn
out with a long breath, now &s;tealing off into a different cadence, now
interrupted by a break, then changing into a new note by an unexpected
tran&s;ition, now &s;eeming to renew the &s;ame &s;train, then deceiving
expec|tation! She &s;ometimes &s;eems to murmur within her&s;elf; full, deep,
&s;harp, &s;wift, drawl|ing, trembling; now at the top, the middle, and the
bottom of the &s;cale! In &s;hort, in <PB N="327" REF="357"> that little bill
&s;eems to re&s;ide all the melody which man has vainly laboured to bring from
a variety of mu&s;ical in&s;truments. Some even &s;eem to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of a different &s;ong from the re&s;t, and contend with each other with great
ardour. The bird overcome is then &s;een only to di&s;continue its &s;ong with
its life."</Q></P>
<P>This mo&s;t famous of the feathered tribe vi&s;its England in
the beginning of April, and leaves us in Augu&s;t. It is found but in &s;ome of
the &s;outhern parts of the country, being totally un|known in Scotland,
Ireland, or North Wales. They frequent thick hedges and low coppices, and
generally keep in the middle of the bu&s;h, &s;o that they are rarely &s;een.
They begin their &s;ong in the evening, and generally continue it for the whole
night. For weeks together, if undi&s;turbed, they &s;it upon the &s;ame tree;
and Shake&s;pear rightly de&s;cribes the nightingale &s;itting nightly in the
&s;ame place, which I have frequently ob&s;erved &s;he &s;eldom parts from.</P>
<P>From Pliny's de&s;cription, we &s;hould be led to believe this
bird po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a per&s;evering &s;train; but, though it is in fact
&s;o with the nightingale in Italy, yet in our hedges in Eng|land, the little
&s;ong&s;tre&s;s is by no means &s;o li|beral of her mu&s;ic. Her note is
&s;oft, various, and interrupted; &s;he &s;eldom holds it without a 
<PB N="328" REF="358"> pau&s;e above the time that one can count twenty. The
nightingale's pau&s;ing &s;ong would be the proper epithet for this bird's
mu&s;ic with us, which is more plea&s;ing than the warbling of any other bird,
becau&s;e it is heard at a time when all the re&s;t are &s;ilent.</P>
<P>In the beginning of May, the nightingale prepares to make its
ne&s;t, which is formed of the leaves of trees, &s;traw and mo&s;s. The ne&s;t
being very eagerly &s;ought after, is as cun|ningly &s;ecreted; &s;o that but
very few of them are found by the boys when they go upon the&s;e pur&s;uits. It
is built at the bottom of hedges, where the bu&s;hes are thicke&s;t and be&s;t
covered. While the female continues &s;itting, the male at a good di&s;tance,
but always within hearing, chears the patient hour with his voice, and, by the
&s;hort interruption of his &s;ong, often gives her warning of approaching
danger. She lays four or five eggs; of which but a part, in our cold climate,
come to maturity.</P>
<P>The delicacy, or rather the fame, of this bird's mu&s;ic, has
induced many to abridge its liberty to be &s;ecured of its &s;ong. Indeed, the
greate&s;t part of what has been written concern|ing it in our country,
con&s;i&s;ts in directions how to manage it for dome&s;tic &s;inging; while the
hi&s;tory of the bird is confined to dry receipts <PB N="329" REF="359"> for
fitting it for the cage. Its &s;ong, however, in captivity is not &s;o very
alluring; and the tyranny of taking it from tho&s;e hedges where only it is
mo&s;t plea&s;ing, &s;till more de|preciates its impri&s;oned efforts. Ge&s;ner
a&s;|&s;ures us, that it is not only the mo&s;t agreeable &s;ong&s;ter in a
cage, but that it is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a mo&s;t admirable faculty of
talking. He tells the following &s;tory in proof of his a&s;&s;ertion, which he
&s;ays was communicated to him by a friend. 
<Q REND="inline">"Whil&s;t I was at Rati&s;bone," &s;ays his
corre&s;pondent, "I put up at an inn, the &s;ign of the Golden Crown, where my
ho&s;t had three nightingales. What I am going to re|peat is wonderful,
almo&s;t incredible, and yet is true. The nightingales were placed
&s;epa|rately, &s;o that each was &s;hut up by it&s;elf in a dark cage. It
happened at that time, being the &s;pring of the year, when tho&s;e birds are
wont to &s;ing indefatigably, that I was &s;o af|flicted with the &s;tone, that
I could &s;leep but very little all night. It was u&s;ual then about midnight,
when there was no noi&s;e in the hou&s;e, but all &s;till, to hear the two
nightin|gales jangling, and talking with each other, and plainly imitating
men's di&s;cour&s;es. For my part I was almo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hed with wonder;
for at this time, when all was quiet el&s;e, they <PB N="330" REF="360"> held
conference together, and repeated what|ever they had heard among the gue&s;ts
by day. Tho&s;e two of them that were mo&s;t notable, and ma&s;ters of this
art, were &s;carce ten foot di&s;tant from one another. The third hung more
remote, &s;o that I could not &s;o well hear it as I lay abed. But it is
wonderful to tell how tho&s;e two provoked each other; and by an&s;wering,
invited and drew one another to &s;peak. Yet did they not confound their words,
or talk both together, but rather utter them alternately and of cour&s;e.
Be&s;ides, the daily di&s;cour&s;e of the gue&s;ts, they chanted out two
&s;tories, which generally held them from midnight till morning; and that with
&s;uch modulations and inflections, that no man could have taken to come from
&s;uch little creatures. When I a&s;ked the ho&s;t if they had been taught, or
whether he ob|&s;erved their talking in the night, he an|&s;wered, no: the
&s;ame &s;aid the whole family. But I, who could not &s;leep for nights
to|gether, was perfectly &s;en&s;ible of their di&s;|cour&s;e. One of their
&s;tories was concerning the tap&s;ter and his wife, who refu&s;ed to follow
him to the wars as he de&s;ired her; for the hu&s;band endeavoured to
per&s;uade his wife, as far as I under&s;tood by the birds, that he 
<PB N="331" REF="361"> would leave his &s;ervice in that inn, and go to the
wars in hopes of plunder. But &s;he refu&s;ed to follow him, re&s;olving to
&s;tay either at Rati&s;bone, or go to Nuremberg. There was a long and
earne&s;t contention be|tween them; and all this dialogue the birds repeated.
They even repeated the un&s;eemly words which were ca&s;t out between them, and
which ought rather to have been &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed and kept a &s;ecret. But the
birds, not knowing the difference between mode&s;t, immode&s;t, hone&s;t and
filthy words, did out with them. The other &s;tory was concerning the war which
the emperor was then threat|ening again&s;t the prote&s;tants; which the birds
probably heard from &s;ome of the gene|rals that had conferences in the
hou&s;e. The&s;e things did they repeat in the night after twelve o'clock, when
there was a deep &s;ilence. But in the day-time, for the mo&s;t part, they were
&s;ilent, and &s;eemed to do nothing but medi|tate and revolve with
them&s;elves upon what the gue&s;ts conferred together as they &s;at at table,
or in their walks. I verily had never believed our Pliny writing &s;o many
wonderful things concerning the&s;e little creatures, had I not my&s;elf &s;een
with my eyes, and heard them with my ears uttering &s;uch things as I have 
<PB N="332" REF="362"> related. Neither yet can I of a &s;udden write all or
call to rememberance every particular that I have heard."</Q></P>
<P>Such is the &s;agacity a&s;cribed to the nightin|gale; it is but
to have high reputation for any one quality, and the world is ready enough to
give us fame for others to which we have very &s;mall preten&s;ions. But there
is a little bird, ra|ther celebrated for its affection to mankind than its
&s;inging, which however, in our climate, has the &s;weete&s;t note of all
others. The reader already perceives that I mean the red-brea&s;t, the well
known friend of man, that is found in every hedge, and makes it vocal. The note
of other birds is louder, and their inflections more capricious; but this
bird's voice is &s;oft, tender, and well &s;upported; and the more to be valued
as we enjoy it the greate&s;t part of the winter. If the nightingale's &s;ong
has been compared to the fiddle, the red-brea&s;t's voice has all the delicacy
of the flute.</P>
<P>The red-brea&s;t, during the &s;pring, haunts the wood, the
grove, and the garden; it retires to the thicke&s;t and &s;hadie&s;t hedge-rows
to breed in. But in winter it &s;eems to become more dome&s;tic, and often to
claim protection from man. Mo&s;t of the &s;oft billed birds, the nightingale,
the &s;wallow, and the tit-mou&s;e, <PB N="333" REF="363"> leave us in the
winter, when their in&s;ect food is no longer offered in plenty; but the
red-brea&s;t continues with us the year round, and endeavours to &s;upport the
famine of winter by chirping round the warm habitations of man|kind, by coming
into tho&s;e &s;helters where the rigour of the &s;ea&s;on is artificially
expelled, and where in&s;ects them&s;elves are found in greater numbers,
attracted by the &s;ame cau&s;e.</P>
<P>This bird breeds differently in different places: in &s;ome
countries, its ne&s;t is u&s;ually found in the crevice of &s;ome mo&s;&s;y
bank, or at the foot of an hawthorn in hedge-rows; in others, it chu&s;es the
thicke&s;t coverts, and hides its ne&s;t with oak leaves. The eggs are from
four to five, of a dull white, with reddi&s;h &s;treaks.</P>
<P>The lark, whether the &s;ky lark, the wood, or the tit-lark,
being all di&s;tingui&s;hable from other little birds by the length of their
heel, are louder in their &s;ong than either of the former, but not &s;o
plea&s;ing. Indeed, the mu&s;ic of every bird in captivity produces no very
plea&s;|ing &s;en&s;ations; it is but the mirth of a little animal
in&s;en&s;ible of its unfortunate &s;ituation; it is the land&s;cape, the
grove, the golden break of day, the conte&s;t upon the hawthorn, the fluttering
from branch to branch, the &s;oaring in the air, and the an&s;wering of its
young, <PB N="334" REF="364"> that gives the bird's &s;ong its true reli&s;h.
The&s;e united, improve each other, and rai&s;e the mind to a &s;tate of the
highe&s;t, yet mo&s;t harmle&s;s ex|ultation. Nothing can in this &s;ituation
of mind be more plea&s;ing than to &s;ee the lark warbling upon the wing;
rai&s;ing its note as it &s;oars until it &s;eems lo&s;t in the immen&s;e
heights above us; the note continuing, the bird it&s;elf un&s;een; to &s;ee it
then de&s;cending with a &s;well as it comes from the clouds, yet &s;inking by
degrees as it approaches its ne&s;t, the &s;pot where all its affec|tions are
centered; the &s;pot that has prompted all this joy.</P>
<P>The lark builds its ne&s;t upon the ground, beneath &s;ome turf
that &s;erves to hide and &s;helter it. The female lays four or five eggs, of a
du&s;ky hue in colour, &s;omewhat like tho&s;e of a plover. It is while &s;he
is &s;itting that the male thus u&s;ually entertains her with his &s;inging;
and while he is ri&s;en to an imperceptible height, yet he &s;till has his
loved partner in his eye, nor once lo&s;es &s;ight of the ne&s;t either while
he a&s;cends or is de&s;cending. This harmony continues &s;e|veral months,
beginning early in the &s;pring on pairing. In winter they a&s;&s;emble in
flocks, when their &s;ong for&s;akes them, and the bird-catchers de&s;troy them
in great numbers for the tables of the luxurious.</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="365">The Black-cap and the Wren, though &s;o
very diminutive, are yet prized by &s;ome for their &s;inging. The former is
called by &s;ome the mock nightingale; and the latter is admired for the
loudne&s;s of its note, compared to the little body from whence it i&s;&s;ues.
It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that this di&s;proportion between the voice of a
bird and its &s;ize, in &s;ome mea&s;ure demands our wonder. Quadrupedes in
this re&s;pect may be con&s;idered as mutes to them. The peacock is louder than
the lion, and the rabbit is not &s;o loud as the wren. But it mu&s;t be
con&s;idered that birds are very differently formed; their lungs in &s;ome
mea&s;ure are ex|tended through their whole body, while in quadrupedes they lie
only in the brea&s;t. In birds there are a variety of cells which take in the
air, and thus pour forth their contents at the little animal's command. The
black-cap and the wren, therefore, are as re&s;pectable for their voices as
they might be deemed incon|&s;iderable for their &s;ize.</P>
<P>All the&s;e &s;oft billed birds, thus prized for their
&s;inging, are rendered dome&s;tic, and brought up with a&s;&s;iduity by &s;uch
as are fond of their voices in a cage. The &s;ame method of treat|ment &s;erves
for all, as their food and their habits are nearly the &s;ame. The manner of
taking <PB N="336" REF="366"> and treating them, particularly the nightingale,
is this. A nightingale's ne&s;t may be found by ob&s;erving the place where the
male &s;ings, and then by &s;ticking two or three meal-worms (a kind of maggot
found in flower on &s;ome neigh|bouring thorn, which when he &s;ees he will
in|fallibly bear away to his young. By li&s;tening, he then may be heard with
the female chirping to the young ones while they are feeding. When the ne&s;t
is found, if the young ones are not fledged enough to be taken, they mu&s;t not
be touched with the hands, for then the old ones will perceive it, and entice
them away. They &s;hould not be taken till they are almo&s;t as full of
feathers as the old ones; and, though they refu&s;e their meat, yet, by opening
their bills, you may give them two or three &s;mall bits at a time, which will
make them &s;oon grow tame, when they will feed them&s;elves. They &s;hould be
put ne&s;t and all into a little ba&s;ket, which &s;hould be covered up warm;
and they &s;hould be fed every two hours. Their food &s;hould be &s;heep's
hearts, or other raw fle&s;h meat, chopped very fine, and all the &s;trings,
&s;kins, and fat, taken away. But it &s;hould always be mixed with hard hen's
eggs, upon which they will feed and thrive abundantly.</P>
<P>They &s;hould then be put in cages like the 
<PB N="337" REF="367"> nightingale's back cage, with a little &s;traw or dry
mo&s;s at the bottom; but when they are grown large they &s;hould have ant's
mold. They &s;hould be kept very clean, as indeed &s;hould all &s;inging-birds
what&s;oever; for otherwi&s;e they will have the cramp, and perhaps the claws
will drop off. In autumn they will &s;ometimes ab&s;tain from their food for a
fortnight, unle&s;s two or three meal-worms be given them twice or thrice a
week, or two or three &s;piders in a day; they mu&s;t likewi&s;e have a little
&s;affron in their water. Figs chopped &s;mall among their meat will help them
to recover their fle&s;h. When their legs are cramped, they &s;hould be
anointed with fre&s;h butter, or capon's fat, three or four days together. If
they grow melancholly, put white &s;ugar-candy into their water, and feed them
with &s;heep's-heart, giving them three or four meal-worms in a day, and a few
ants with their eggs. They &s;hould al&s;o have &s;affron in their water.</P>
<P>With regard to adult birds, tho&s;e that are taken before the
twenty-third of April are ac|counted the be&s;t, becau&s;e after that they
begin to pair. They u&s;ually haunt woods, coppices, and quick&s;et hedges,
where they may be taken in trap cages baited with meal-worms. They &s;hould be
placed as near the &s;pot where the <PB N="338" REF="368"> bird &s;ings as
po&s;&s;ible; and before you fix the trap, turn up the earth twice the breadth
of the cage, becau&s;e they will there look for food. They are al&s;o taken
with lime twigs, placing them upon the hedge where they u&s;ually &s;ing; and
there &s;hould be meal-worms &s;tuck at proper places to draw them into the
&s;nare. After they are taken, their wings &s;hould be gently tied with thread,
to prevent their beating them&s;elves again&s;t the cage. This &s;hould be
fir&s;t hung in a private place, that the bird may not be di|&s;turbed; and it
&s;hould be fed every two hours, at farthe&s;t, with &s;heep's-heart and egg
minced very fine, mixing it with meal-worms. How|ever, the fir&s;t food mu&s;t
be worms, ants, ca|terpillars, and flies. You mu&s;t, to feed the bird, take it
in your hand, and open the bill with a &s;tick made thick at one end, giving it
the in&s;ects, or four or five bits of food as big as peas, to entice it to
eat. Its common food &s;hould be mixed with ants, &s;o that when the bird goes
to pick the ants it may pick up &s;ome of that al&s;o. The nightingale, when
caged, be|gins to &s;ing about the latter end of November, and continues its
&s;ong till June.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of the Canary-bird, and other hard billed
Singing-birds.</HEAD>
<P>THE Canary-bird is now become &s;o common, and has continued
&s;o long in a dome&s;tic &s;tate, that its native habits, as well as its
native country, &s;eem almo&s;t forgotten. Though, by the name, it appears that
the&s;e birds came ori|ginally from the Canary I&s;lands, yet we have it only
from Germany, where they are bred up in great numbers, and &s;old into
different parts of Europe. At what period they were brought into Europe is not
well known; but it is cer|tain that about a century ago they were &s;old at
very high prices, and kept only for the amu&s;e|ment of the great. They have
&s;ince been multiplied in great abundance; and their price is dimini&s;hed in
proportion to their plenty.</P>
<P>In its native i&s;lands, a region equally noted for the beauty
of its land&s;capes and the harmony of its groves, the canary-bird is of a
du&s;ky grey colour, and &s;o different from tho&s;e u&s;ually &s;een in
Europe, that &s;ome have even doubted whe|ther it be of the &s;ame &s;pecies.
With us, they have that variety of colouring u&s;ual in all do|me&s;tic 
<PB N="340" REF="370"> fowls; &s;ome white, &s;ome mottled, &s;ome beautifully
&s;haded with green; but they are more e&s;teemed for their note than their
beauty, having a high piercing pipe, as indeed all tho&s;e of the finch tribe
have, continuing for &s;ome time in one breath without intermi&s;&s;ion, then
rai&s;ing it higher and higher by degrees, with great variety.</P>
<P>It is this that has rendered the canary-bird next to the
nightingale the mo&s;t celebrated &s;ong&s;ter; and, as it is more ea&s;ily
reared than any of the &s;oft billed birds, and continues its &s;ong throughout
the year, it is rather the mo&s;t com|mon in our hou&s;es. Rules, therefore,
have been laid down, and copious in&s;tructions given, for breeding the&s;e
birds in a dome&s;tic &s;tate; which, as a part of them may conduce towards the
natural hi&s;tory of the bird, I will take leave to tran&s;cribe.</P>
<P>In chu&s;ing the canary-bird, tho&s;e are be&s;t that appear
with life and boldne&s;s, &s;tanding upright upon the perch like a
&s;parrow-hawk, and not apt to be frighted at every thing that &s;tirs. If its
eyes look chearful, and not drow&s;y, it is a &s;ign of health; but, on the
contrary, if it hides its head under the wing, and gathers its body up, the&s;e
are &s;ymptoms of its being out of order. In chu&s;ing them the melody of the 
<PB N="341" REF="371"> &s;ong &s;hould al&s;o be minded: &s;ome will open with
the notes of the nightingale, and, run|ning through a variety of modulations,
end like the tit-lark. Others will begin like the &s;ky-lark; and, by a &s;oft
melodious turn, fall into the notes of the nightingale. The&s;e are le&s;&s;ons
taught this bird in its dome&s;tic &s;tate, and generally taught it by others;
but its na|tive note is loud, &s;hrill, piercing, and enough to deafen the
hearers. There are per&s;ons who admire each of the&s;e &s;ongs, but the
&s;econd is in the mo&s;t general e&s;timation.</P>
<P>Canary-birds &s;ometimes breed all the year round; but they
mo&s;t u&s;ually begin to pair in April, and to breed in June and Augu&s;t.
Tho&s;e are &s;aid to be the be&s;t breeders that are produced between the
Engli&s;h and the French.</P>
<P>Towards the latter end of March, a cock and a hen &s;hould be
put together in a &s;mall cage, where they will peck at each other in the
beginning, but will &s;oon become thoroughly reconciled. The room where they
are kept to breed &s;hould be &s;o &s;ituated as to let the birds have the
benefit of the morning &s;un, and the windows &s;hould be of wire, not gla&s;s,
that they may enjoy the benefit of the air. The floor of the room &s;hould be
kept clean, and &s;ometimes there &s;hould be dry gravel or &s;and &s;ifted
upon <PB N="342" REF="372"> it. There &s;hould al&s;o be two windows, one at
each end, and &s;everal perches at proper di|&s;tances for the birds to
&s;ettle on, as they fly backwards and forwards. A tree in the middle of the
room would be the mo&s;t convenient to divert the birds, and &s;ometimes to
&s;erve for building their ne&s;ts upon.</P>
<P>In Germany they prepare a large room, and build it in the manner
of a barn, being much longer than broad, with a &s;quare place at each end, and
&s;everal holes to go into tho&s;e &s;quare places. In tho&s;e outlets they
plant &s;everal &s;orts of trees, in which the birds take great delight to
&s;ing and breed. The bottom of the place they &s;trew with &s;and, and upon it
ca&s;t rape-&s;eed, chick-weed and ground&s;il, which the old birds feed upon
while breeding. In the body of the hou&s;e they put all &s;orts of &s;tuff for
building the ne&s;t, and brooms, one under the other, in all the corners, for
the birds to build in. The&s;e they &s;eparate by partitions from each other,
to prevent tho&s;e above flying down upon, or otherwi&s;e incommoding &s;uch as
breed below. The light al&s;o is excluded, for no bird is fond of having light
come to its ne&s;t.</P>
<P>With us, the apparatus for breeding is le&s;s expen&s;ive; a
little breeding-cage &s;ometimes &s;uffices, but &s;eldom any thing more
exten&s;ive <PB N="343" REF="373"> than a &s;mall room. While the birds are
pairing it is u&s;ual to feed them with &s;oft meat; that is, bread,
maw-&s;eed, a little &s;calded rape-&s;eed, and near a third part of an egg.
The room &s;hould be furni&s;hed with &s;tuff for making their ne&s;ts; &s;uch
as fine hay, wool, cotton, and hair. The&s;e materials &s;hould be thoroughly
dry, and then mixed and tied together in &s;uch a manner that the birds may
readily pull out what they want. This &s;hould be hung in a proper part of the
room, and the male will take his turn in building the ne&s;t, &s;itting upon
the eggs, and feeding the young. They are generally two or three days in
building their ne&s;ts; the hen commonly lays five eggs; and in the &s;pace of
fourteen days the young will be excluded. So prolific are the&s;e birds
&s;ometimes that the female will be ready to hatch a &s;econd brood before the
fir&s;t are able to quit the ne&s;t. On the&s;e occa&s;ions, &s;he leaves the
ne&s;t and the young to provide her&s;elf with another to lay her new brood in.
In the mean time, the male, more faithful to the duties of his tru&s;t, breeds
up the young left behind, and fits them for a &s;tate of independance.</P>
<P>When the young ones are excluded, the old ones &s;hould be
&s;upplied with a &s;ufficiency of &s;oft food every day, with likewi&s;e
fre&s;h greens, <PB N="344" REF="374"> &s;uch as cabbage, lettuce, and
chick-weed; in June, &s;hepherd's pur&s;e; and in July and Au|gu&s;t, plantane.
They are never to have ground&s;il after the young are excluded. With the&s;e
different delicacies, the old ones will take particular care to feed and bring
up their young; but it is u&s;ual when they can feed them&s;elves to be taken
from the ne&s;t and put into cages. Their meat then is the yolk of an egg
boiled hard, with an equal quantity of fine bread, and a little &s;calded
rape-&s;eed: this mu&s;t be brui&s;ed till it becomes fine, and then it may be
mixed with a little maw-&s;eed; after which, blend all together; which is to be
&s;upplied them fre&s;h every day.</P>
<P>The canary-bird, by being kept in company with the linnet or the
gold-finch, pairs and produces a mixed breed, more like the canary-bird, and
re&s;embling it chiefly in its &s;ong. Indeed, all this tribe with &s;trong
bills and piercing notes, and feeding upon grain, have the mo&s;t &s;trong
&s;imilitude to each other, and may ju&s;tly be &s;uppo&s;ed, as Mr. Buffon
ima|gines, to come from the &s;ame original. They all breed about the &s;ame
time; they frequent the &s;ame vegetables; they build in the &s;ame hedges and
trees; and are brought up for the cage with the &s;ame food and precautions.
The linnet, the bull-finch, and the gold-finch, when <PB N="345" REF="375"> we
know the hi&s;tory of the canary-bird, have &s;carce any peculiarities that can
attract our curio&s;ity, or require our care. The only art nece&s;&s;ary with
all tho&s;e that have no very fine note is to breed them up under &s;ome more
plea&s;ing harmoni&s;t. The gold-finch learns a fine &s;ong from the
nightingale; and the linnet and bull-finch may be taught, forgetting the wild
notes of nature, to whi&s;tle a long and regular tune.</P>

<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="346" REF="376">
<HEAD>CHAP. V. Of the Swallow and its Affinities.</HEAD>
<P>AN idea of any one bird in the former cla&s;&s;es will give us
&s;ome tolerable conception of the re&s;t. By knowing the linnet, or the
canary-bird, we have &s;ome notion of the manners of the gold-finch; by
exhibiting the hi&s;tory of the nightingale, we &s;ee al&s;o that of the
black-cap or the tit-mou&s;e. But the &s;wallow tribe &s;eems to be entirely
different from all the former: different in their form, different in their
habits, and unlike in all the particulars of their hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>In this tribe is to be found the Goat &s;ucker, which may be
&s;tyled a nocturnal &s;wallow: it is the large&s;t of this kind, and is known
by its tail, which is not forked, like that of the com|mon &s;wallow. It begins
its flight at evening, and makes a loud &s;ingular noi&s;e, like the whur of a
&s;pinning-wheel. To this al&s;o belongs the Hou&s;e-&s;wallow, which is too
well known to need a de&s;cription: the Martin, inferior in &s;ize to the
former, and the tail much le&s;s forked; it differs al&s;o in its ne&s;t, which
is covered at top, while that of the hou&s;e-&s;wallow is open; and the Swift,
rather larger than the hou&s;e-&s;wallow, with all the <PB N="347" REF="377">
toes &s;tanding forward; in which it differs from the re&s;t of its kind. All
the&s;e re&s;emble each other &s;o &s;trongly, that it is not without
difficulty the &s;maller kinds are known a&s;under.</P>
<P>The&s;e are all known by their very large mouths, which, when
they fly, are always kept open; they are not le&s;s remarkable for their
&s;hort &s;lender feet, which &s;carce are able to &s;up|port the weight of
their bodies; their wings are of immoderate extent for their bulk; their
plumage is glo&s;&s;ed with a rich purple; and their note is a &s;light
twittering, which they &s;eldom exert but upon the wing.</P>
<P>This peculiar conformation &s;eems attended with a &s;imilar
peculiarity of manners. Their food is in&s;ects, which they always pur&s;ue
flying. For this rea&s;on, during fine weather, when the in&s;ects are mo&s;t
likely to be abroad, the &s;wal|lows are for ever upon the wing, and &s;een
pur|&s;uing their prey with amazing &s;wiftne&s;s and agility. All &s;maller
animals, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, find &s;afety by winding and turning, when they
endeavour to avoid the greater: the lark thus evades the pur&s;uit of the hawk;
and man the crocodile. In this manner, in&s;ects upon the wing endeavour to
avoid the &s;wallow; but this bird is admirably fitted by nature to pur&s;ue
them through their &s;horte&s;t turnings. Be&s;ides a <PB N="348" REF="378">
great length of wing, it is al&s;o provided with a long tail, which, like a
rudder, turns it in its mo&s;t rapid motions; and thus, while it is
po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of the greate&s;t &s;wiftne&s;s, it is al&s;o
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the mo&s;t extreme agility.</P>
<P>Early, therefore, in the &s;pring, when the returning &s;un
begins to rouze the in&s;ect tribe from their annual &s;tate of torpidity, when
the gnat and the beetle put off their earthly robes and venture into air, the
&s;wallow then is &s;een returning from its long migration beyond the ocean,
and making its way feebly to the &s;hore. At fir&s;t, with the timidity of a
&s;tranger, it ap|pears but &s;eldom, and flies but &s;lowly and heavily along.
As the weather grows warmer, and its in&s;ect &s;upply encrea&s;es, it then
gathers greater &s;trength and activity. But it &s;ometimes happens that a
rainy &s;ea&s;on, by repelling the in&s;ects, &s;tints the &s;wallow in its
food; the poor bird is then &s;een &s;lowly &s;kimming along the &s;urface of
the ground, and often re&s;ting after a flight of a few minutes. In general,
however, it keeps on the wing, and moving with a ra|pidity that nothing can
e&s;cape. When the weather promi&s;es to be fair, the in&s;ect tribe feel the
genial influence, and make bolder flights; at which time the &s;wallow follows
them in their aerial journeys, and often ri&s;es to im|perceptible 
<PB N="349" REF="379"> heights in the pur&s;uit. When the weather is likely to
be foul, the in&s;ects feel the fir&s;t notices of it; and from the &s;wallow's
fol|lowing low we are often apprized of the ap|proaching change.</P>
<P>When &s;ummer is fairly begun, and more than a &s;ufficient
&s;upply for &s;u&s;taining the wants of nature every where offers, the
&s;wallow then begins to think of forming a progeny. The ne&s;t is built with
great indu&s;try and art; parti|cularly by the common &s;wallow, which builds
it on the tops of chimnies. The martin &s;ticks it to the eaves of hou&s;es.
The goat-&s;ucker, as we are told, builds it on the bare ground. This ne&s;t is
built with mud from &s;ome neigh|bouring brook, well tempered with the bill,
moi&s;tened with water for the better adhe&s;ion; and &s;till farther kept
firm, by long gra&s;s and fibres: within it is lined with goo&s;e feathers,
which are ever the warme&s;t and the neate&s;t. The martin covers its ne&s;t at
top, and has a door to enter at; the &s;wallow leaves her's quite open. But our
European ne&s;ts are nothing to be com|pared with tho&s;e the &s;wallow builds
on the coa&s;ts of China and Coromandel; the de&s;cription of which I will
give, in the plain hone&s;t phra&s;e of Willoughby. 
<Q REND="inline">"On the &s;ea-coa&s;t of the kingdom of China,"
&s;ays he, "a &s;ort of <PB N="350" REF="380"> party-coloured birds, of the
&s;hape of &s;wallows, at a certain &s;ea&s;on of the year, which is their
breeding-time, come out of the mid-land country to the rocks, and from the foam
or froth of the &s;ea-water da&s;hing again&s;t the bottom of the rocks, gather
a certain clammy, glutinous matter, perchance the &s;pawn of whales or other
young fi&s;hes, of which they build their ne&s;ts, wherein they lay their eggs
and hatch their young. The&s;e ne&s;ts the Chine&s;e pluck from the rocks, and
bring them, in great numbers, into the Ea&s;t-Indies to &s;ell. They are
e&s;teemed, by gluttons, as great delicacies; who, di&s;&s;olving them in
chicken or mutton-broth, are very fond of them; far before oy&s;ters,
mu&s;hrooms, or other dainty and lickori&s;h mor&s;els."</Q> What a pity this
luxury hath not been introduced among us; and then our great fea&s;ters might
be enabled to eat a little more!</P>
<P>The &s;wallow u&s;ually lays from five to &s;ix eggs, of a white
colour, &s;peckled with red; and &s;ometimes breeds twice a year. When the
young brood are excluded, the &s;wallow &s;upplies them very plentifully, the
fir&s;t brood particularly, when &s;he finds her&s;elf capable of producing two
broods in a year. This happens when the parents come early, when the &s;ea&s;on
is peculiarly mild, <PB N="351" REF="381"> and when they begin to pair &s;oon.
Sometimes they find a difficulty in rearing even a &s;ingle ne&s;t,
particularly when the weather has been &s;evere, or their ne&s;ts have been
robbed in the beginning of the &s;ea&s;on. By the&s;e accidents, this
im|portant ta&s;k is &s;ometimes deferred to the middle of September.</P>
<P>At the latter end of September they leave us; and for a few days
previous to their de|parture, a&s;&s;emble, in va&s;t flocks, on hou&s;e-tops,
as if deliberating on the fatiguing journey that lay before them. This is no
&s;light under|taking, as their flight is directed to Congo, Senegal, and along
the whole Morocco &s;hore. There are &s;ome, however, left behind in this
general expedition, that do not part till eight or ten days after the re&s;t.
The&s;e are chiefly the latter weakly broods, which are not yet in a condition
to &s;et out. They are &s;ome|times even too feeble to venture, till the
&s;etting in of winter; while their parents vainly exhort them to efforts which
in&s;tinct a&s;&s;ures them they are incapable of performing. Thus it often
happens, that the wretched little families, being compelled to &s;tay, peri&s;h
the fir&s;t cold weather that comes; while the tender parents &s;hare the fate
of their offspring, and die with their new-fledged brood.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="382">Tho&s;e that migrate, are fir&s;t
ob&s;erved to arrive in Africa, as Mr. Adan&s;on a&s;&s;ures us, about the
beginning of October. They are thought to have performed their fatiguing
journey in the &s;pace of &s;even days. They are &s;ometimes &s;een, when
interrupted by contrary winds, wavering in their cour&s;e far off at &s;ea, and
lighting upon whatever &s;hip they find in their pa&s;&s;age. They then &s;eem
&s;pent with famine and fatigue; yet &s;till they boldly venture, when
refre&s;hed by a few hours re&s;t, to renew their flight, and continue the
cour&s;e which they had been &s;teering before.</P>
<P>The&s;e are facts, proved by inconte&s;tible au|thority; yet it
is a doubt whether all &s;wallows migrate in this manner, or whether there may
not be &s;ome &s;pecies of this animal that, though externally alike, are &s;o
internally different, as to be very differently affected by the approach of
winter. We are a&s;&s;ured, from many, and the&s;e not contemptible
witne&s;&s;es, that &s;wallows hide them&s;elves in holes under ground, joined
clo&s;e together, bill again&s;t bill, and feet again&s;t feet. Some inform us
that they have &s;een them taken out of the water, and even from under the ice,
in bunches, where they are a&s;&s;erted to pa&s;s the winter without motion.
Reaumur, who particularly intere&s;ted him&s;elf in this en|quiry, 
<PB N="353" REF="383"> received &s;everal accounts of bundles of &s;wallows
being thus found in quarries and under the water. The&s;e men, therefore, have
a right to &s;ome degree of a&s;&s;ent; and are not to lo&s;e all credit from
our ignorance of what they aver.</P>
<P>All, however, that we have hitherto di&s;&s;ected, are formed
within like other birds; and &s;eem to offer no ob&s;ervable variety. Indeed,
that they do not hide them&s;elves under water, has been pretty well proved, by
the noted experiment of Fri&s;ch, who tied &s;everal threads died in
water-colours, round the legs of a great number of &s;wallows, that were
preparing for their de|parture: the&s;e, upon their return the en&s;uing
&s;ummer, brought their threads back with them, no way damaged in their colour;
which they mo&s;t certainly would, if, during the winter, they had been
&s;teeped in water: yet &s;till this is a &s;ubject on which we mu&s;t
&s;u&s;pend our a&s;&s;ent, as Klein, the naturali&s;t, has brought &s;uch a
number of proofs, in defence of his opinion, that &s;wallows are torpid in
winter, as even the mo&s;t incredulous mu&s;t allow to have &s;ome degree of
probability.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Of the Humming-bird and its Varieties.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING given &s;ome hi&s;tory of the manners of the mo&s;t
remarkable birds of which accounts can be obtained, I might now go to a very
ex|ten&s;ive tribe, remarkable for the &s;plendour and the variety of their
plumage: but the de&s;crip|tion of the colours of a beautiful bird, has
no|thing in it that can inform or entertain; it rather excites a longing, which
it is impo&s;&s;ible for words to &s;atisfy. Naturali&s;ts, indeed, have
endeavoured to &s;atisfy this de&s;ire, by coloured prints; but, be&s;ide that
the&s;e at be&s;t give only a faint re&s;emblance of nature, and are a very
indifferent kind of painting, the bird it&s;elf has a thou&s;and beauties, that
the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite arti&s;t is incapable of imitating. They, for
in&s;tance, who imagine they have a complete idea of the beauty of the little
tribe of Manikin birds, from the pictures we have of them, will find
them&s;elves deceived, when they compare their draughts with nature. The
&s;hining greens, the changeable purples, and the glo&s;&s;y reds, are beyond
the reach of the pencil; and very far beyond the coloured print, which is but a
<PB N="355" REF="385"> poor &s;ub&s;titute to painting. I have therefore
declined entering into a minute de&s;cription of foreign birds of the &s;parrow
kind; as &s;ounds would never convey an adequate idea of colours.</P>
<P>There is one &s;pecies, however, that I will conclude the
hi&s;tory of this cla&s;s with; as, though the lea&s;t, it will certainly be
allowed the mo&s;t beautiful of all others. In quadrupedes, the &s;malle&s;t
animals are noxious, ugly and loath&s;ome; the &s;malle&s;t of birds are the
mo&s;t beautiful, innocent and &s;portive. Of all tho&s;e that flutter in the
garden, or paint the land|&s;cape, the Humming-bird is the mo&s;t delightful to
look upon, and the mo&s;t inoffen&s;ive.</P>
<P>Of this charming little animal, there are &s;ix or &s;even
varieties, from the &s;ize of a &s;mall wren, down to that of an humble-bee. An
European could never have &s;uppo&s;ed a bird exi&s;ting &s;o very &s;mall, and
yet completely fur|ni&s;hed out with a bill, feathers, wings, and
in|te&s;tines, exactly re&s;embling tho&s;e of the large&s;t kind. A bird not
&s;o big as the end of one's little finger, would probably be &s;uppo&s;ed but
a creature of imagination, were it not &s;een in in|finite numbers, and as
frequent as butterflies in a &s;ummer's day, &s;porting in the fields of
Ame|rica, from flower to flower, and extracting their &s;weets with its little
bill.</P>
<P><PB N="356" REF="386">The &s;malle&s;t humming-bird is about the
&s;ize of an hazel-nut. The feathers on its wings and tail are black; but
tho&s;e on its body, and under its wings, are of a greeni&s;h brown, with a
fine red ca&s;t or glo&s;s, which no &s;ilk or velvet can imitate. It has a
&s;mall cre&s;t on its head, green at the bottom, and as it were gilded at the
top; and which &s;parkles in the &s;un like a little &s;tar in the middle of
its forehead. The bill is black, &s;traight, &s;lender, and of the length of a
&s;mall pin. The larger humming-bird is near half as big as the common wren,
and without a cre&s;t on its head; but, to make amends, it is covered, from the
throat half way down the belly, with changeable crim&s;on coloured feathers,
that, in different lights, change to a variety of beautiful colours, much like
an opal. The heads of both are &s;mall, with very little round eyes as black as
jet.</P>
<P>It is inconceivable how much the&s;e add to the high fini&s;hing
and beauty of a rich luxurious we&s;tern land&s;cape. As &s;oon as the &s;un is
ri&s;en, the humming-birds, of different kinds, are &s;een fluttering about the
flowers, without ever lighting upon them. Their wings are in &s;uch rapid
motion, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;cern their colours, except by their
glittering. They <PB N="357" REF="387"> are never &s;till, but continually in
motion, vi|&s;iting flower after flower, and extracting its honey as if with a
ki&s;s. For this purpo&s;e they are furni&s;hed with a forky tongue, that
enters the cup of the flower and extracts its nectared tribute. Upon this alone
they &s;ub&s;i&s;t. The rapid motion of their wings brings out an hum|ming
&s;ound, from whence they have their name; for whatever divides the air
&s;wiftly, mu&s;t thus produce a murmur.</P>
<P>The ne&s;ts of the&s;e birds are not le&s;s curious than the
re&s;t: they are &s;u&s;pended in the air, at the point of the twigs of an
orange, a pome|granate, or a citron-tree; &s;ometimes even in hou&s;es, if they
find a &s;mall and convenient twig for the purpo&s;e. The female is the
architect, while the male goes in que&s;t of materials; &s;uch as cotton, fine
mo&s;s, and the fibres of vege|tables. Of the&s;e materials a ne&s;t is
compo&s;ed, of about the &s;ize of an hen's egg cut in two, admirably
contrived, and warmly lined with cotton. They lay two eggs at a time, and never
more, about the &s;ize of &s;mall peas, and as white as &s;now, with here and
there a yellow &s;peck. The male and the female &s;it upon the ne&s;t by turns;
but the female takes to her&s;elf the greate&s;t &s;hare. She &s;eldom quits
the ne&s;t, except a few minutes in the morning and <PB N="358" REF="388">
evening, when the dew is upon the flowers and their honey in perfection. During
this &s;hort interval, the male takes her place; for, as the egg is &s;o
&s;mall, the expo&s;ing it ever &s;o &s;hort a time to the weather, would be
apt to injure its contents, the &s;urface expo&s;ed being &s;o great in
compari&s;on to the bulk. The time of incubation continues twelve days; at the
end of which the young ones appear, much about the &s;ize of a blue-bottle fly.
They are at fir&s;t bare; by degrees they are covered with down; and, at
la&s;t, feathers &s;ucceed, but le&s;s beautiful at fir&s;t than tho&s;e of the
old ones.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"Father Labat's companion, in the mi&s;&s;ion to
America, found the ne&s;t of an humming-bird, in a &s;hed that was near the
dwelling-hou&s;e, and took it in, at a time when the young ones were about
fifteen or twenty days old; he then placed them in a cage at his chamber
window, to be amu&s;ed by their &s;portive flutterings; but he was &s;oon
&s;ur|prized to &s;ee the old ones, that came and fed their brood regularly
every hour in the day. By the&s;e means they them&s;elves &s;oon grew &s;o tame
that they &s;eldom quitted the chamber; but, without any con&s;traint, came to
live with their young ones. All four have fre|quently come to perch upon their
ma&s;ter's <PB N="359" REF="389"> hand, chirruping as if they had been at
liberty abroad. He fed them with a very fine clear pa&s;te, made of wine,
bi&s;cuit and &s;ugar. They thru&s;t their tongues into this pa&s;te, till they
were &s;atisfied, and then fluttered and chirruped about the room. I never
beheld any thing more agreeable," continues he, "than this lovely little
family, that had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my companion's chamber, and that
flew out and in ju&s;t as they thought proper; but were ever attentive to the
voice of their ma&s;ter, when he called them. In this manner they lived with
him for above &s;ix months; but, at a time when he expected to &s;ee a new
colony formed, he unfortunately forgot to tie up their cage to the cieling at
night, to pre&s;erve them from the rats, and he found they were devoured in the
morn|ing."</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e birds, on the continent of America, continue to flutter
the year round; as their food, which is the honey of flowers, never for&s;akes
them in tho&s;e warm latitudes where they are found. But it is otherwi&s;e in
the i&s;lands of the Antilles, where, when the winter &s;ea&s;on approaches,
they retire, and, as &s;ome &s;ay, continue in a torpid &s;tate during the
&s;eve|rity of that &s;ea&s;on. At Surinam and Jamaica, <PB N="360" REF="390">
where they con&s;tantly have flowers, the&s;e beau|tiful birds are never known
to di&s;appear.</P>
<P>It is a doubt whether or not the&s;e birds have a continued note
in &s;inging. All travellers agree that, be&s;ide the humming noi&s;e produced
by their wings, they have a little interrupted chirrup; but Labat a&s;&s;erts,
that they have a mo&s;t plea&s;ing melancholy melody in their voices, though
&s;mall and proportioned to the organs which produce it. It is very probable
that, in different places, their notes are al&s;o different; and as there are
&s;ome that continue torpid all the winter, there may likewi&s;e be &s;ome with
agree|able voices, though the re&s;t may in general be &s;ilent.</P>
<P>The Indians formerly made great u&s;e of this pretty bird's
plumage, in adorning their belts and head-dre&s;s. The children take them in
the fields upon rings &s;meared with bird-lime: they approach the place where
the birds are flying, and twirling their rings in the air, &s;o allure them,
either by the colour or the &s;ound, that the &s;imple little creature comes to
re&s;t upon the ring, and is &s;eized. They are then in&s;tantly killed and
gutted, and hung up in the chimney to dry. Tho&s;e who take greater care, dry
them in a &s;tove, which is not &s;o likely to injure the plumage as the
foregoing method. Their <PB N="361" REF="391"> beautiful feathers were once the
ornament of the highe&s;t rank of &s;avage nobility: but at pre|&s;ent, they
take the bird rather for the purpo&s;e of &s;elling it as a curio&s;ity to the
Europeans, than that of ornament for them&s;elves. All the ta&s;te for &s;avage
finery is wearing out fa&s;t, even among the Americans. They now begin to
adopt, if not the dre&s;&s;es of Europe, at lea&s;t the materials of which they
are compo&s;ed. The wandering warrior is far from thinking him&s;elf fine at
pre&s;ent with his bow and his feathered crown: his ambition reaches to higher
orna|ments; a gun, a blue &s;hirt and a blanket.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="365" REF="393">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of Birds of the Crane Kind in General.</HEAD>
<P>THE progre&s;&s;ions of Nature from one cla&s;s of beings to
another, are always by &s;low and almo&s;t imperceptible degrees. She has
peopled the woods and the fields with a variety of the mo&s;t beautiful birds;
and, to leave no part of her exten&s;ive territories untenanted, &s;he has
&s;tocked the waters with its feathered inha|bitants al&s;o: &s;he has taken
the &s;ame care in pro|viding for the wants of her animals in this ele|ment, as
&s;he has done with re&s;pect to tho&s;e of the other: &s;he has u&s;ed as much
precaution to render water-fowl fit for &s;wimming, as &s;he did in forming
land-fowl for flight: &s;he has defended their feathers with a natural oil, and
united their toes by a webbed membrane; by which contrivances they have at once
&s;ecurity and motion. But between the cla&s;&s;es of land-birds that &s;hun
the water, and of water-fowl that are made for &s;wimming and living on it,
&s;he has formed a very numerous tribe of birds, that &s;eem to partake of a
middle nature; that, with divided toes, &s;eemingly fitted to live upon land,
are at the &s;ame time furni&s;hed with appe|tites <PB N="366" REF="394"> that
chiefly attach them to the waters. The&s;e can properly be called neither
land-birds nor water-fowl, as they provide all their &s;u&s;te|nance from
watery places, and yet are unqua|lified to &s;eek it in tho&s;e depths where it
is often found in greate&s;t plenty.</P>
<P>This cla&s;s of birds, of the crane kind, are to be
di&s;tingui&s;hed from others rather by their appetites than their
conformation. Yet even in this re&s;pect they &s;eem to be &s;ufficiently
di&s;|criminated by Nature: as they are to live among the waters, yet are
incapable of &s;wim|ming in them, mo&s;t of them have long legs, fitted for
wading in &s;hallow waters, or long bills proper for groping in them.</P>
<P>Every bird of this kind, habituated to mar&s;hy places, may be
known, if not by the length of its legs, at lea&s;t by the &s;caly &s;urface of
them. Tho&s;e who have ob&s;erved the legs of a &s;nipe or a woodcock, will
ea&s;ily perceive my meaning; and how different the &s;urface of the &s;kin
that covers them is from that of the pigeon or the partridge. Mo&s;t birds of
this kind al&s;o, are bare of feathers half way up the thigh; at lea&s;t, in
all of them, above the knee. Their long habits of wading in the waters, and
having their legs continually in moi&s;ture, prevents the growth of feathers on
tho&s;e parts; &s;o that there is a &s;ur|prizing <PB N="367" REF="395">
difference between the leg of a crane, naked of feathers almo&s;t up to the
body, and the falcon, booted almo&s;t to the very toes.</P>
<P>The bill al&s;o is very di&s;tingui&s;hable in mo&s;t of this
cla&s;s. It is, in general, longer than that of other birds, and in &s;ome
finely fluted on every &s;ide; while at the point it is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
extreme &s;en&s;ibility, and furni&s;hed with nerves, for the better feeling
their food at the bottom of mar&s;hes, where it cannot be &s;een. Some birds of
this cla&s;s are thus fitted with every con|venience: they have long legs, for
wading; long necks, for &s;tooping; long bills, for &s;earch|ing; and nervous
points, for feeling. Others are not &s;o amply provided for; as &s;ome have
long bills, but legs of no great length; and others have long necks, but very
&s;hort legs. It is a rule which univer&s;ally holds, that where the bird's
legs are long, the neck is al&s;o long in proportion. It would indeed be an
in|curable defect in the bird's conformation, to be lifted upon &s;tilts above
its food, without being furni&s;hed with an in&s;trument to reach it.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider the natural power of this cla&s;s, in a
comparative view, they will &s;eem rather inferior to tho&s;e of every other
tribe. Their ne&s;ts are more &s;imple than tho&s;e of the &s;parrow; and their
methods of obtaining food le&s;s inge|nious <PB N="368" REF="396"> than tho&s;e
of the falcon: the pie exceeds them in cunning; and though they have all the
voraciou&s;ne&s;s of the poultry tribe; they want their fecundity. None of this
kind, therefore, have been taken into man's &s;ociety, or under his protection;
they are neither caged, like the nightingale; nor kept tame, like the turkey;
but lead a life of precarious liberty, in fens and mar&s;hes, at the edges of
lakes, and along the &s;ea-&s;hore. They all live upon fi&s;h or in&s;ects, one
or two only excepted; even tho&s;e that are called mud&s;uckers, &s;uch as the
&s;nipe and the woodcock, it is more than probable, grope the bottom of
mar&s;hy places only for &s;uch in&s;ects as are depo&s;ited there by their
kind, and live in a vermicular &s;tate, in pools and pla&s;hes, till they take
wing, and become flying in&s;ects.</P>
<P>All this cla&s;s, therefore, that are fed upon in&s;ects, their
food being ea&s;ily dige&s;tible, are good to be eaten; while tho&s;e who live
entirely upon fi&s;h, abounding in oil, acquire in their fle&s;h the rancidity
of their diet, and are, in ge|neral, unfit for our tables. To &s;avages indeed,
and &s;ailors on a long voyage, every thing that has life &s;eems good to be
eaten; and we often find them recommending tho&s;e animals as dain|ties, which
they them&s;elves would &s;purn at, after a cour&s;e of good living. Nothing is
more <PB N="369" REF="397"> common in their journals than &s;uch accounts as
the&s;e&mdash;
<Q REND="inline">"This day we &s;hot a fox&mdash;pretty good
eating: this day we &s;hot a heron&mdash;pretty good eating: and this day we
killed a turtle&mdash;which they rank with the heron and the fox, as pretty
good eating."</Q> Their accounts, there|fore, of the fle&s;h of the&s;e birds,
are not to be depended upon; and when they cry up the heron or the &s;tork of
other countries as luxurious food, we mu&s;t always attend to the &s;tate of
their appetites who give the character.</P>
<P>In treating of this cla&s;s of birds, it will be be&s;t to
ob&s;erve the &s;imple&s;t method po&s;&s;ible; neither to load the memory with
numerous di|&s;tinctions, nor yet confu&s;e the imagination, by a total want of
arrangement. I will therefore de&s;cribe &s;ome of the larger &s;orts
&s;eparately; as in an hi&s;tory of birds, each of the&s;e demands peculiar
di&s;tinction. The crane, the &s;tork, the Ballearic crane, the heron, the
bittern, with &s;ome others, may require a &s;eparate hi&s;tory. Some
particular tribes may next offer, that may very naturally be cla&s;&s;ed
together: and as for all the &s;maller and lea&s;t remarkable &s;orts, they may
be grouped into one general de&s;cription.</P>

<PB N="370" REF="398">
<HEAD>CHAP. II. The Crane.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is &s;omething extraordinary in the different accounts we
have of this bird's &s;ize and dimen&s;ions. Willoughby and Penant make the
Crane from five to &s;ix feet long, from the tip to the tail. Other accounts
&s;ay, that it is above five feet high; and others, that it is as tall as a
man. From the many which I my&s;elf had &s;een, I own this imputed magnitude
&s;urprized me; as from memory I was convinced, they could neither be &s;o long
nor &s;o tall. Indeed, a bird, the body of which is not larger than that of a
turkey-hen, and acknowledged on all hands not to weigh above ten pounds, cannot
ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed to be almo&s;t as long as an o&s;trich. Bri&s;&s;on,
however, &s;eems to give this bird its real dimen&s;ions, when he de&s;cribes
it as &s;omething le&s;s than the brown &s;tork, about three feet high, and
about four from the tip to the tail. Still, however, the numerous
te&s;ti|monies of its &s;uperior &s;ize are not to be totally rejected; and
perhaps, that from which Bri&s;&s;on took his dimen&s;ions, was one of the
&s;malle&s;t of the kind.</P>
<P><PB N="371" REF="399">The crane, taking its dimen&s;ions from
him, is exactly three feet four inches from the tip to the tail, and four feet
from the head to the toe. It is a tall, &s;lender bird, with a long neck and
long legs. The top of the head is covered with black bri&s;tles, and the back
of it is bald and red, which &s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;hes this bird from
the &s;tork, to which it is very nearly allied in &s;ize and figure. The
plumage, in general, is a&s;h-coloured; and there are two large tufts of
feathers, that &s;pring from the pinion of each wing. The&s;e bear a
re&s;emblance to hair, and are finely curled at the ends, which the bird has a
power of erecting and depre&s;&s;ing at plea&s;ure. Ge&s;ner &s;ays, that
the&s;e feathers, in his time, u&s;ed to be &s;et in gold, and worn as
ornaments in caps.</P>
<P>Such are the dimen&s;ions of a bird, concerning which, not to
mention modern times, there have been more fables propagated than of any other.
It is a bird with which all the antient writers are familiar; and, in
de&s;cribing it, they have not failed to mix imagination with hi&s;tory. From
the policy of the cranes, they &s;ay, we are to look for an idea of the mo&s;t
perfect republic among&s;t our&s;elves; from their tender|ne&s;s to their
decrepid parents, which they take care to nouri&s;h, to cheri&s;h, and
&s;upport when <PB N="372" REF="400"> flying, we are to learn le&s;&s;ons of
filial piety; but particularly from their conduct in fighting with the pigmies
of Ethiopia, we are to receive our maxims in the art of war. In early times,
the hi&s;tory of nature fell to the lot of poets only, and certainly none could
de&s;cribe it &s;o well; but it is a part of their province to embelli&s;h
al&s;o; and when this agreeable &s;cience was claimed by a more &s;ober cla&s;s
of people, they were obliged to take the accounts of things as they found them;
and, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, fable ran down blended with truth to
po&s;terity.</P>
<P>In the&s;e accounts, therefore, there is &s;ome foundation of
truth; yet much more has been added by fancy. The crane is certainly a very
&s;ocial bird, and they are &s;eldom &s;een alone. Their u&s;ual method of
flying or &s;itting, is in flocks of fifty or &s;ixty together; and while a
part feed, the re&s;t &s;tand like centinels upon duty. The fable of their
&s;upporting their aged parents, may have ari&s;en from their &s;trict
connubial affection; and as for their fighting with the pigmies, it may not be
improbable but that they have boldly with&s;tood the inva&s;ions of monkies
coming to rob their ne&s;ts; for, in this ca&s;e, as the crane lives upon
vegetables, it is not probable that it would be the fir&s;t aggre&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>However this be, the crane is a wandering, <PB N="373" REF="401"> &s;ociable bird, that, for the mo&s;t part, &s;ub&s;i&s;ts upon
vegetables; and is known in every country of Europe, except our own. There is
no part of the world, &s;ays Belonius, where the fields are cultivated, that
the crane does not come in with the hu&s;bandman for a &s;hare in the
har|ve&s;t. As they are birds of pa&s;&s;age, they are &s;een to depart and
return regularly at tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons when their provi&s;ion invites or
repels them. They generally leave Europe about the latter end of autumn, and
return in the beginning of &s;ummer. In the inland parts of the continent, they
are &s;een cro&s;&s;ing the country, in flocks of fifty or an hundred, making
from the northern regions towards the &s;outh. In the&s;e migra|tions, however,
they are not &s;o re&s;olutely bent upon going forward, but that if a field of
corn offers in their way, they will &s;top a while to re|gale upon it: on
&s;uch occa&s;ions they do incre|dible damage, chiefly in the night; and the
hu&s;bandman, who lay down in joyful expec|tation, ri&s;es in the morning to
&s;ee his fields laid entirely wa&s;te, by an enemy, who&s;e march is too
&s;wift for his vengeance to overtake.</P>
<P>Our own country is free from their vi&s;its; not but that they
were formerly known in this i&s;land, and held in great e&s;timation, for the
de|licacy of their fle&s;h: there was even a penalty <PB N="374" REF="402">
upon &s;uch as de&s;troyed their eggs; but, at pre&s;ent, they never go &s;o
far out of their way. Cultivation and populou&s;ne&s;s go hand in hand; and
though our fields may offer them a greater plenty, yet it is &s;o guarded, that
the birds find the venture greater than the enjoyment; and probably we are much
better off by their ab&s;ence than their company. Whatever their fle&s;h might
once have been, when, as Plutarch tells us, cranes were blinded and kept in
coops, to be fattened for the tables of the great in Rome; or, as they were
brought up, &s;tuffed with mint and rue, to the tables of our nobles at home;
at pre&s;ent, they are con&s;idered all over Europe as wretched eating. The
fle&s;h is fibrous and dry, requiring much preparation to make it palatable;
and even after every art, it is fit only for the &s;tomachs of &s;trong and
labouring people.</P>
<P>The cold Artic region &s;eems to be this bird's favourite abode.
They come down into the more &s;outhern parts of Europe, rather as vi&s;it|ants
than inhabitants: yet it is not well known in what manner they portion out
their time, to the different parts of the world. The migra|tions of the
fieldfare or thru&s;h, are obvious, and well known; they go northward or
&s;outhward, in one &s;imple track; when their food fails them here, they have
but one region to go to. But <PB N="375" REF="403"> it is otherwi&s;e with the
crane; he changes place, like a wanderer: he &s;pends the autumn in Europe; he
then flies off, probably to &s;ome more &s;outhern climate, to enjoy a part of
the winter; returns to Europe in the &s;pring; cro&s;&s;es up to the north in
&s;ummer; vi&s;its tho&s;e lakes that are never dry; and then comes down again,
to make depredations upon our cultivated grounds, in autumn. Thus, Ge&s;ner
a&s;&s;ures us, that the cranes u&s;ually began to quit Germany, from about the
eleventh of September to the &s;even|teenth of October; from thence they were
&s;een flying &s;outhward by thou&s;ands; and Redi tells us, they arrive in
Tu&s;cany a &s;hort time after. There they tear up the fields, newly &s;own,
for the grain ju&s;t committed to the ground, and do great mi&s;chief. It is to
be &s;uppo&s;ed that, in the &s;everity of winter, they go &s;outhward, &s;till
nearer the line. They again appear in the fields of Pi&s;a, regularly about the
twentieth of February, to anticipate the &s;pring.</P>
<P>In the&s;e journeys it is amazing to conceive the heights to
which they a&s;cend, when they fly. Their note is the loude&s;t of all other
birds; and that is often heard in the clouds, when the bird it&s;elf is
entirely un&s;een. As it is light for its &s;ize, and &s;preads a large
expan&s;e of wing, it is capable of floating, at the greate&s;t height, 
<PB N="376" REF="404"> where the air is lighte&s;t; and as it &s;ecures its
&s;afety, and is entirely out of the reach of man, it flies in tracts which
would be too fatiguing for any other birds to move forward in.</P>
<P>In the&s;e aerial journeys, though un&s;een them&s;elves, they
have the di&s;tincte&s;t vi&s;ion of every object below. They govern and direct
their flight by their cries; and exhort each other to proceed or to de&s;cend,
when a fit op|portunity offers for depredation. Their voice, as was ob&s;erved,
is the loude&s;t of all the fea|thered tribe; and its peculiar clangor ari&s;es
from the very extraordinary length and contortion of the windpipe. In
quadrupedes, the windpipe is &s;hort, and the glottis, or cartilages that form
the voice, are at that end of it which is next the mouth: in water fowl the
windpipe is longer, but the cartilages that form the voice are at the other
end, which lies down in their belly. By this means they have much louder
voices, in proportion to their &s;ize, than any other animals whatever; for the
note, when formed below, is reverberated through all the rings of the windpipe,
till it reaches the air. But the voice of the duck or the goo&s;e, is no|thing
to be compared to that of the crane, who&s;e windpipe is not only made in the
&s;ame manner with theirs, but is above twenty times <PB N="377" REF="405"> as
long. Nature &s;eems to have be&s;towed much pains in lengthening out this
organ. From the out&s;ide, it enters through the fle&s;h into the
brea&s;t-bone, which hath a great cavity within to receive it. There, being
thrice reflected, it goes out again at the &s;ame hole, and &s;o turns down to
the lungs, and thus enters the body a &s;econd time. The loud clangorous
&s;ound which the bird is thus enabled to produce, is, when near, almo&s;t
deafening: however, it is particularly &s;erviceable to the animal it&s;elf,
ei|ther during its migrations or its &s;tay: by it the flock is encouraged in
their journies; and if, while they are feeding, which is u&s;ually performed in
profound &s;ilence, they are invaded on any &s;ide, the bird that fir&s;t
perceives the danger, is &s;ure to &s;ound the alarm, and all are &s;peedily
upon the wing.</P>
<P>As they ri&s;e but heavily, they are very &s;hy birds, and
&s;eldom let the fowler approach them. Their depredations are u&s;ually made in
the darke&s;t nights; at which time they enter a field of corn, and trample it
down, as if it had been cro&s;&s;ed over by a regiment of men. On other
occa&s;ions, they chu&s;e &s;ome exten&s;ive &s;olitary mar&s;h, where they
range them&s;elves all day, as if they were in deliberation; and not having 
<PB N="378" REF="406"> that grain which is mo&s;t to their appetites, wade the
mar&s;hes, for in&s;ects, and other food, which they can procure with le&s;s
danger.</P>
<P>Corn is their favourite food; but there is &s;carce any other
that comes ami&s;s to them. Redi, who opened &s;everal, found the &s;tomach of
one full of the herb called dandelion; that of another was filled with beans; a
third had a great quantity of clover in its &s;tomach; while that of two others
was filled with earth-worms and beetles: in &s;ome he found lizards and
&s;ea-fi&s;h; in others, &s;nails, gra&s;s, and pebbles, &s;wal|lowed perhaps
for medicinal purpo&s;es. It &s;eems, therefore, that the&s;e birds are
ea&s;ily &s;upplied; and that they are noxious to corn-fields but on &s;ome
particular occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>In general it is a peaceful bird, both in its own &s;ociety, and
with re&s;pect to tho&s;e of the fore&s;t. Though &s;o large in appearance, a
little falcon pur&s;ues, and often di&s;ables it. The method is, with tho&s;e
who are fond of hawk|ing, to fly &s;everal hawks together again&s;t it; which
the crane endeavours to avoid, by flying up perpendicularly, till the air
becomes too thin to &s;upport it any higher. The hawk, however, &s;till bears
it company; and though le&s;s fitted for floating in &s;o thin a medium, yet, 
<PB N="379" REF="407"> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of greater rapidity, it &s;till gains
the a&s;cendency. They both often ri&s;e out of &s;ight; but &s;oon the
&s;pectator, who keeps his eye fixed above, perceives them, like two &s;pecks,
be|ginning to appear: they gather on his eye for a little &s;pace, and
&s;hortly after come tumbling per|pendicularly together, with great animo&s;ity
on the &s;ide of the hawk, and a loud &s;creaming on that of the crane. Thus
driven to extremity, and unable to fly, the poor animal throws it&s;elf upon
its back, and, in that &s;ituation, makes a mo&s;t de&s;perate defence, till
the &s;port&s;man coming up, generally puts an end to the conte&s;t with its
life.</P>
<P>It was once the barbarous cu&s;tom to breed up cranes to be thus
baited; and young ones were taken from the ne&s;t, to be trained up for this
cruel diver&s;ion. It is an animal ea&s;ily tamed; and, if we can believe
Albertus Mag|nus, has a particular affection for man. This quality, however,
was not &s;ufficient to guard it from being made the victim of his fierce
amu&s;ements. The female, which is ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed from the male, by
not being bald behind as he is, never lays above two eggs at a time; being like
tho&s;e of a goo&s;e, but of a blui&s;h colour. The young ones are &s;oon fit
to <PB N="380" REF="408"> fly, and then the parents for&s;ake them to &s;hift
for them&s;elves; but, before this time, they are led forth to the places where
their food is mo&s;t ea&s;ily found. Though yet unfledged, they run with &s;uch
&s;wiftne&s;s that a man cannot ea&s;ily overtake them. We are told, that as
they grow old, their plumage becomes darker; and, as a proof of their
longevity, Aldrovandus a&s;&s;ures us, that a friend of his kept one tame for
above forty years.</P>
<P>Whatever may have been the di&s;po&s;ition of the great, the
vulgar of every country, to this day, bear the crane a compa&s;&s;ionate
regard. It is po&s;&s;ible the antient prejudices in its favour, which once
having been planted, are eradicated but &s;lowly, may &s;till continue to
operate. In &s;ome countries, it is con&s;idered as an heinous offence to kill
a crane; and though the legi&s;la|ture declines to puni&s;h, yet the people do
not fail to re&s;ent, the injury. The crane, they, in &s;ome mea&s;ure,
con&s;ider as the prophet of the &s;ea&s;on: upon its approach or delay they
regu|late the periods of their rural oeconomy. If their favourite bird comes
early in the &s;ea&s;on, they expect a plentiful &s;ummer; if he is &s;low in
his vi&s;its, they then prepare for an unfa|vourable &s;pring. Whatever
wi&s;dom there may <PB N="381" REF="409"> be in de&s;pi&s;ing the prejudices of
the vulgar, there is but little in condemning them. They have generally had
their origin in good motives; and it &s;hould never be our endeavours to
&s;up|pre&s;s any tender emotions of friend&s;hip or pity, in tho&s;e hard
brea&s;ts that are, in general, un|&s;u&s;ceptible of either.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. The Stork.</HEAD>
<P>IF we regard the Stork externally only, we &s;hall be very apt
to confound it with the crane. It is of the &s;ame &s;ize; it has the &s;ame
formation as to the bill, neck, legs, and body, except that it is &s;omething
more corpulent. Its differ|ences are but very &s;light; &s;uch as the colour,
which in the crane is a&s;h and black, but in the &s;tork is white and brown.
The nails of the toes of the &s;tork al&s;o are very peculiar; not being clawed
like tho&s;e of other birds, but flat like the nails of a man.</P>
<P>The&s;e, however, are but very &s;light differ|ences; and its
true di&s;tinctions are to be taken rather from its manners than its form. The
crane has a loud piercing voice; the &s;tork is &s;ilent, and produces no other
noi&s;e than the clacking of its under chap again&s;t the upper: the crane has
a &s;trange convolution of the wind-pipe through the brea&s;t-bone; the
&s;tork's is formed in the u&s;ual manner: the crane feeds mo&s;tly upon
vegetables and grain; the &s;tork preys entirely upon frogs, fi&s;hes, birds,
and &s;erpents: the crane avoids towns and po|pulous <PB N="383" REF="411">
places; the &s;tork lives always in or near them: the crane lays but two eggs,
and the &s;tork generally four. The&s;e are di&s;tinc|tions fully &s;ufficient
to mark the &s;pecies, not|with&s;tanding the &s;imilitude of their form.</P>
<P>Storks are birds of pa&s;&s;age, like the former; but it is hard
to &s;ay whence they come or whi|ther they go. When they withdraw from Eu|rope,
they all a&s;&s;emble on a particular day, and never leave one of their company
behind them. They take their flight in the night; which is the rea&s;on the way
they go has never been ob|&s;erved. They generally return into Europe in the
middle of March, and make their ne&s;ts on the tops of chimnies and hou&s;es as
well as of high trees. The females lay from two to four eggs, of the &s;ize and
colour of tho&s;e of gee&s;e; and the male and female &s;it upon them by turns.
They are a month in hatching; and when their young are excluded, they are
parti|cularly &s;olicitous for their &s;afety.</P>
<P>As the food of the&s;e birds con&s;i&s;ts in a great mea&s;ure
of frogs and &s;erpents, it is not to be wondered at that different nations
have paid them a particular veneration. The Dutch are very &s;olicitous for the
pre&s;ervation of the &s;tork in every part of their republic. This bird
&s;eems to have taken refuge among their towns; and <PB N="384" REF="412">
builds on the tops of their hou&s;es without any mole&s;tation. There it is
&s;een re&s;ting familiarly in their &s;treets, and protected as well by the
laws as the prejudices of the people. They have even got an opinion that it
will only live in a republic; and that &s;tory of its filial piety, fir&s;t
fal&s;ely propagated of the crane, has in part been a&s;cribed to the &s;tork.
But it is not in re|publics alone that the &s;tork is &s;een to re&s;ide, as
there are few towns on the continent, in low mar&s;hy &s;ituations, but have
the &s;tork as an inmate among them; as well the de&s;potic princes of Germany
as the little republics of Italy.</P>
<P>The &s;tork &s;eems a general favourite even among the moderns;
but with the antient Egyptians their regard was carried even to ado|ration.
This enlightened people, who wor|&s;hipped the Deity in his creatures, paid
divine honours to the ibis, as is univer&s;ally known. It has been u&s;ually
&s;uppo&s;ed that the antient ibis is the &s;ame with that which goes at
pre&s;ent by the &s;ame name; a bird of the &s;tork kind, of about the &s;ize
of a curlew, all over black, with a bill very thick in the beginning, but
ending in a point for the better &s;eizing its prey, which is caterpillars,
locu&s;ts, and &s;erpents. But, however u&s;eful the modern ibis may be in
ridding Egypt, where it re&s;ides, of the vermin <PB N="385" REF="413"> and
venemous animals that infe&s;t it; yet it is much doubted whether this be the
&s;ame ibis to which the ancients paid their adoration. Mail|let, the French
con&s;ul at Cairo, ob&s;erves, that it is very hard to determine what bird the
an|cient ibis certainly was, becau&s;e there are cranes, &s;torks, hawks,
kites, and falcons, that are all equally enemies to &s;erpents, and devour a
va&s;t number. He farther adds, that in the months of May, when the winds begin
to blow from the internal parts of Africa, there are &s;everal &s;orts of birds
that come down from Upper Egypt, from whence they are driven by the rains, in
&s;earch of a better habitation, and that it is then they do this country
&s;uch &s;ignal &s;er|vices. Nor does the figure of this bird hierogli|phically
repre&s;ented on their pillars mark it &s;ufficiently to make the
di&s;tinction. Be&s;ides, the modern ibis is not peculiar to Egypt, as it is to
be &s;een but at certain &s;ea&s;ons of the year; whereas we are informed by
Pliny, that this bird was &s;een no where el&s;e. It is thought, therefore,
that the true ibis is a bird of the vul|ture kind, de&s;cribed above, and
called by &s;ome the capon of Pharaoh, which not only is a de|vourer of
&s;erpents, but will follow the caravans that go to Mecca, to feed upon the
offal of the animals that are killed on the journey.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of the Balearic and other foreign Cranes.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING ended the la&s;t chapter with doubts concerning the ibis,
we &s;hall begin this with doubts concerning the Balearic Crane. Pliny has
de&s;cribed a bird of the crane-kind with a topping re&s;embling that of the
green wood-pecker. This bird for a long time continued unknown till we became
acquainted with the birds of tropical climates, when one of the crane-kind with
a topping was brought into Europe, and de&s;cribed by Aldrovandus as Pliny's
Balearic Crane. Hence the&s;e birds, which have &s;ince been brought from
Africa and the Ea&s;t in numbers, have received the name of Balearic Cranes,
but without any ju&s;t foundation. The real Balearic Crane of Pliny &s;eems to
be the le&s;&s;er a&s;h-coloured heron, with a topping of narrow white
feathers, or perhaps the egret, with two long feathers that fall back from the
&s;ides of the head. The bird that we are about to de&s;cribe under the name of
the Balearic Crane was unknown to the ancients; and the heron or egret ought to
be rein&s;tated in their ju&s;t title to that name.</P>

<P><PB N="387" REF="418">When we &s;ee a very extraordinary animal,
we are naturally led to &s;uppo&s;e that there mu&s;t be &s;omething al&s;o
remarkable in its hi&s;tory to corre&s;pond with the &s;ingularity of its
figure. But it often happens that hi&s;tory fails on tho&s;e occa&s;ions where
we mo&s;t de&s;ire informa|tion. In the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, in particular, no
bird pre&s;ents to the eye a more whim&s;ical figure than this, which we mu&s;t
be content to call the Balearic Crane. It is pretty nearly of the &s;hape and
&s;ize of the ordinary crane, with long legs and a long neck, like others of
the kind; but the bill is &s;horter, and the colour of the feathers of a dark
greeni&s;h grey. The head and throat form the mo&s;t &s;triking part of this
bird's figure. On the head is &s;een &s;tanding up, a thick round cre&s;t, made
of bri&s;tles, &s;preading every way, and re&s;embling rays &s;tanding out in
different directions. The longe&s;t of the&s;e rays are about three inches and
an half; and they are all topped with a kind of black ta&s;&s;els, which give
them a beautiful appearance. The &s;ides of the head and cheeks are bare,
whiti&s;h, and edged with red, while underneath the throat hangs a kind of bag
or wattle, like that of a cock, but not divided into two. To give this odd
compo&s;ition a higher fini&s;hing, the eye is large and &s;taring; the pupil
black and big, <PB N="388" REF="419"> &s;urrounded with a gold-coloured iris
that com|pletes the bird's very &s;ingular appearance.</P>
<P>From &s;uch a peculiar figure, we might be led to wi&s;h for a
minute hi&s;tory of its manners; but of the&s;e we can give but &s;light
information. This bird comes from the coa&s;t of Africa and the Cape de Verd
I&s;lands. As it runs, it &s;tretches out its wings, and goes very &s;wiftly,
otherwi&s;e its u&s;ual motion is very &s;low. In their dome&s;tic &s;tate,
they walk very deliberately among other poultry, and &s;uffer them&s;elves to
be approached (at lea&s;t it was &s;o with that I &s;aw) by every &s;pectator.
They never roo&s;t in hou&s;es but about night: when they are di&s;po&s;ed to
go to re&s;t, they &s;earch out &s;ome high wall, on which they pearch in the
manner of a peacock. Indeed, they &s;o much re&s;emble that bird in manners and
di&s;po&s;ition, that &s;ome have de|&s;cribed them by the name of the
&s;ea-peacock; and Ray has been inclined to rank them in the &s;ame family.
But, though their voice and roo&s;ting be &s;imilar, their food, which is
entirely upon greens, vegetables, and barley, &s;eems to make &s;ome
difference.</P>
<P>In this chapter of foreign birds of the crane-kind, it will be
proper to mention the Jabiru and the Jabiru Guacu, both natives of Bra&s;il. Of
the&s;e great birds of the crane-kind we know <PB N="389" REF="420"> but
little, except the general out-line of their figure, and the enormous bills
which we often &s;ee pre&s;erved in the cabinets of the curious. The bill of
the latter is red, and thirteen inches long; the bill of the former is black,
and is found to be eleven. Neither of them, however, are of a &s;ize
proportioned to their immoderate length of bill. The jabiru guacu is not above
the &s;ize of a common &s;tork, while the jabiru with the &s;malle&s;t bill
exceeds the &s;ize of a &s;wan. They are both covered with white feathers,
except the head and neck that are naked; and their principal difference is in
the &s;ize of the body and the make of the bill; the lower chap of the jabiru
guacu being broad, and bending upwards.</P>
<P>A bird &s;till more extraordinary may be added to this cla&s;s,
called the Anhima, and, like the the two former, a native of Bra&s;il. This is
a water-fowl of the rapacious kind, and bigger than a &s;wan. The head, which
is &s;mall for the &s;ize of the body, bears a black bill, which is not above
two inches long; but what di&s;tin|gui&s;hes it in particular is a horn growing
from the forehead as long as the bill, and bending forward like that of the
fabulous unicorn of the ancients. This horn is not much thicker than a
crow-quill, as round as if it were turned <PB N="390" REF="421"> in a lathe,
and of an ivory colour. But this is not the only in&s;trument of battle this
formidable bird carries; it &s;eems to be armed at all points; for at the
fore-part of each wing, at the &s;econd joint, &s;pring two &s;traight
triangular &s;purs, about as thick as ones little finger: the foremo&s;t of
the&s;e goads or &s;purs is above an inch long; the hinder is &s;horter, and
both of a du&s;ky colour. The claws al&s;o are long and &s;harp; the colour is
black and white; and they cry terribly loud, &s;ounding &s;omething like Vyhoo
Vyhoo. They are never found alone, but always in pairs; the cock and hen prowl
together; and their fidelity is &s;aid to be &s;uch, that when one dies, the
other never departs from the carca&s;e, but dies with its companion. It makes
its ne&s;t of clay, near the bodies of trees, upon the ground, of the &s;hape
of an oven.</P>
<P>One bird more may be &s;ubjoined to this cla&s;s, not for the
oddity of its figure, but the peculi|arity of its manners. It is vulgarly
called by our &s;ailors the Buffoon Bird, and by the French the Demoi&s;elle,
or Lady. The &s;ame qualities have procured it the&s;e different appellations
from two nations who, on more occa&s;ions than this, look upon the &s;ame
objects in very differ|ent lights. The peculiar ge&s;tures and contor|tions of
this bird, the proper name of which is the Numidian Crane, are extremely
&s;ingular; <PB N="391" REF="422"> and the French, who are &s;killed in the
arts of elegant ge&s;ticulation, con&s;ider all its motions as lady-like and
graceful. Our Engli&s;h &s;ailors however, who have not entered &s;o deeply
into the dancing art, think, that while thus in mo|tion, the bird cuts but a
very ridiculous figure. It &s;toops, ri&s;es, lifts one wing, then another,
turns round, &s;ails forward, then back again; all which highly diverts our
&s;eamen; not imagining, perhaps, that all the&s;e contortions are but the
aukward expre&s;&s;ion not of the poor animal's plea&s;ures but its fears.</P>
<P>It is a very &s;carce bird; the plumage is of a leaden grey; but
it is di&s;tingui&s;hed by fine white feathers, con&s;i&s;ting of long fibres,
which fall from the back of the head, about four inches long; while the
fore-part of the neck is adorned with black feathers, compo&s;ed of very fine,
&s;oft, and long fibres, that hang down upon the &s;tomach, and give the bird a
very graceful appearance. The ancients have de&s;cribed a buffoon bird, but
there are many rea&s;ons to believe that theirs is not the Numidian crane. It
comes from that country from whence it has taken its name.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. Of the Heron and its Varieties.</HEAD>
<P>BIRDS of the crane, the &s;tork, and the heron kind, bear a very
&s;trong affinity to each other; and their differences are not ea&s;ily
di&s;cernible. As for the crane and the &s;tork, they differ rather in their
nature and internal conformation than in their external figure; but &s;till,
they may be known a&s;under, as well by their colour as by the &s;tork's claws,
which are very peculiar, and more re&s;embling a man's nails than the claws of
a bird. The heron may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from both, as well by its &s;ize,
which is much le&s;s, as by its bill, which in proportion is much longer; but
particularly by the middle claw on each foot, which is toothed like a &s;aw,
for the better &s;eizing and holding its &s;lippery prey. Should other marks
fail, however, there is an anatomical di&s;tinction, in which herons differ
from all other birds; which is, that they have but one coecum, and all other
birds have two.</P>
<P>Of this tribe, Bri&s;on has enumerated not le&s;s than
forty-&s;even &s;orts, all differing in their &s;ize, figure, and plumage; and
with talents adapted to their place of re&s;idence, or their peculiar 
<PB N="393" REF="424"> pur&s;uits. But, how various &s;oever the heron kind may
be in their colours or their bills, they all &s;eem po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the
&s;ame manners, and have but one character of cowardice and rapa|city,
indolence, yet in&s;atiable hunger. Other birds are found to grow fat by an
abundant &s;upply of food; but the&s;e, though exce&s;&s;ively de&s;tructive
and voracious, are ever found to have lean and carrion bodies, as if not even
plenty were &s;ufficient for their &s;upport.</P>
<P>The common heron is remarkably light, in proportion to its bulk,
&s;carce weighing three pounds and an half, yet it expands a breadth of wing
which is five feet from tip to tip. Its bill is very long, being five inches
from the point to the ba&s;e; its claws are long, &s;harp, and the middlemo&s;t
toothed like a &s;aw. Yet, thus armed as it appears for war, it is indolent and
cowardly, and even flies at the approach of a &s;parrow-hawk. It was once the
amu&s;ement of the great to pur&s;ue this timorous creature with the falcon;
and heron-hawking was &s;o favourite a diver&s;ion among our an|ce&s;tors, that
laws were enacted for the pre&s;er|vation of the &s;pecies; and the per&s;on
who de|&s;troyed their eggs was liable to a penalty of twenty &s;hillings for
each offence.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent, however, the defects of the ill-judged 
<PB N="394" REF="425"> policy of our ance&s;tors is felt by their po&s;terity;
for, as the amu&s;ement of hawking has given place to the more u&s;eful method
of &s;tocking fi&s;h-ponds, the heron is now become a mo&s;t formidable enemy.
Of all other birds, this commits the greate&s;t deva&s;tation in
fre&s;h-waters; and there is &s;carce a fi&s;h, though never &s;o large, that
he will not &s;trike at and wound, though unable to carry it away. But the
&s;maller fry are his chief &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; the&s;e, pur&s;ued by their
larger fellows of the deep, are obliged to take refuge in &s;hallow waters,
where they find the heron a &s;till more formidable enemy. His method is to
wade as far as he can go into the water, and there patiently wait the approach
of his prey, which when it comes within &s;ight, he darts upon it with
inevitable aim. In this man|ner he is found to de&s;troy more in a week than an
otter in three months. 
<Q REND="inline">"I have &s;een an heron," &s;ays Willoughby,
"that had been &s;hot, that had &s;eventeen carps in his belly at once, which
he will dige&s;t in &s;ix or &s;even hours, and then to fi&s;hing again. I have
&s;een a carp," continues he, "taken out of a he|ron's belly, nine inches and
an half long. Several gentlemen who kept tame herons, to try what quantity one
of them would eat in a day, have put &s;everal &s;maller roach and 
<PB N="395" REF="426"> dace in a tub; and they have found him eat fifty in a
day, one day with another. In this manner a &s;ingle heron will de&s;troy
fifteen thou&s;and carp in a &s;ingle half year."</Q></P>
<P>So great are the dige&s;tive powers of this fre&s;h-water
tyrant, and &s;o detrimental to tho&s;e who &s;tock ponds with fi&s;h. In
general, he is &s;een taking his gloomy &s;tand by the lake &s;ide, as if
meditating mi&s;chief, motionle&s;s and gorged with plunder. His u&s;ual
attitude on this occa&s;ion is to &s;ink his long neck between his &s;houlders,
and keep his head turned on one &s;ide, as if eyeing the pool more intently.
When the call of hunger returns, the toil of an hour or two is generally
&s;ufficient to fill his capacious &s;to|mach; and he retires long before night
to his retreat in the woods. Early in the morning, however, he is &s;een
a&s;&s;iduous at his u&s;ual occu|pation.</P>
<P>But, though in &s;ea&s;ons of fine weather the heron can always
find a plentiful &s;upply; in cold or &s;tormy &s;ea&s;ons, his prey is no
longer within reach: the fi&s;h that before came into the &s;hallow water now
keep in the deep, as they find it to be the warme&s;t &s;ituation. Frogs and
lizards al&s;o &s;eldom venture from their lurking places; and the heron is
obliged to &s;upport him&s;elf upon his long habits of patience, and even to
take up with the weeds that grow upon <PB N="396" REF="427"> the water. At
tho&s;e times he contracts a con|&s;umptive di&s;po&s;ition, which &s;ucceeding
plenty is not able to remove; &s;o that the meagre glut|ton &s;pends his time
between want and riot, and feels alternately the extremes of famine and
ex|ce&s;s. Hence, notwith&s;tanding the care with which he takes his prey, and
the amazing quan|tity he devours, the heron is always lean and emaciated; and
though his crop be u&s;ually found full, yet his fle&s;h is &s;carce
&s;ufficient to cover the bones.</P>
<P>The heron u&s;ually takes his prey by wading into the water, yet
it mu&s;t not be &s;uppo&s;ed that he does not al&s;o take it upon the wing. In
fact, much of his fi&s;hing is performed in this man|ner; but he never hovers
over deep waters, as there his prey is enabled to e&s;cape him by &s;inking to
the bottom. In &s;hallow places he darts with more certainty; for though the
fi&s;h at &s;ight of its enemy in&s;tantly de&s;cends, yet the heron, with his
long bill and legs, in&s;tantly pins it to the bottom, and thus &s;eizes it
&s;ecurely<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> In this manner, after
having been &s;een with its long neck for above a minute under water, he
ri&s;es upon the wing, with a trout or an eel &s;trug|gling in his bill to get
free. The greedy bird, however, flies to the &s;hore, &s;carce gives it time to
expire, but &s;wallows it whole, and then re|turns to fi&s;hing as before.</P>
<P><PB N="397" REF="428">As this bird does incredible mi&s;chief to
ponds newly &s;tocked, Willoughby has given a re|ceipt for taking him. 
<Q REND="inline">"Having found his haunt, get three or four
&s;mall roach or dace, and having provided a &s;trong hook with a wire to it,
this is drawn ju&s;t within &s;ide the &s;kin of the fi&s;h, beginning without
&s;ide the gills and running it to the tail, by which the fi&s;h will not be
killed, but continue for five or &s;ix days alive. Then having a &s;trong line
made of &s;ilk and wire, about two yards and an half long, it is tied to a
&s;tone at one end, the fi&s;h with the hook being &s;uffered to &s;wim about
at the other. This being properly di&s;po&s;ed in &s;hallow water, the heron
will &s;eize upon the fi&s;h to its own de&s;truction. From this method we may
learn, that the fi&s;h mu&s;t be alive, otherwi&s;e the heron will not touch
them, and that this bird, as well as all tho&s;e that feed upon fi&s;h, mu&s;t
be its own ca|terer; for they will not prey upon &s;uch as die naturally, or
are killed by others before them."</Q></P>
<P>Though this bird lives chiefly among pools and mar&s;hes, yet
its ne&s;t is built on the tops of the highe&s;t trees, and &s;ometimes on
cliffs hanging over the &s;ea. They are never in flocks when they fi&s;h,
committing their depredations in &s;olitude and &s;ilence; but in making their 
<PB N="398" REF="429"> ne&s;ts they love each others &s;ociety; and they are
&s;een, like rooks, building in company with flocks of their kind. Their
ne&s;ts are made of &s;ticks and lined with wool; and the female lays four
large eggs of a pale green colour. The ob&s;ervable indolence of their nature,
however, is not le&s;s &s;een in their ne&s;tling than in their habits of
depredation. Nothing is more certain, and I have &s;een it an hundred times,
than that they will not be at the trouble of building a ne&s;t when they can
get one made by the rook, or de&s;erted by the owl, already provided for them.
This they u&s;ually enlarge and line within, driving off the original
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors &s;hould they happen to renew their fruitle&s;s claims.</P>
<P>The French &s;eem to have availed them&s;elves of the indolence
of this bird in making its ne&s;t; and they actually provide a place with
materials fitted for their ne&s;tling, which they call He|ronries. The heron,
which with us is totally unfit for the table, is more &s;ought for in France,
where the fle&s;h of the young ones is in particular e&s;timation. To obtain
this, the natives rai&s;e up high &s;heds along &s;ome fi&s;hy &s;tream; and
furni&s;h|ing them with materials for the herons to ne&s;tle with, the&s;e
birds build and breed there in great abundance. As &s;oon as the young ones are
&s;uppo&s;ed to be fit, the owner of the heronry comes, as we do into a
pigeon-hou&s;e, and carries <PB N="399" REF="430"> off &s;uch as are proper for
eating; and the&s;e are &s;old for a very good price to the neighbouring
gentry. 
<Q REND="inline">"The&s;e are a delicacy which," as my author
&s;ays, "the French are very fond of, but which &s;trangers have not yet been
taught to reli&s;h as they ought."</Q> Neverthele&s;s it was formerly much
e&s;teemed as a food in England, and made a favourite di&s;h at great tables.
It was then &s;aid that the fle&s;h of a heron was a di&s;h for a king; at
pre&s;ent, nothing about the hou&s;e will touch it but a cat.</P>
<P>With us, therefore, as the heron, both old and young, is thought
dete&s;table eating, we &s;eldom trouble the&s;e animals in their heights,
which are for the mo&s;t part &s;ufficiently inacce&s;|&s;ible. Their ne&s;ts
are often found in great numbers in the middle of large fore&s;ts, and in
&s;ome groves nearer home, where the owners have a predilection for the bird,
and do not chu&s;e to drive it from its accu&s;tomed habita|tions. It is
certain that by their cries, their expan&s;ive wings, their bulk, and wavy
motion, they add no &s;mall &s;olemnity to the fore&s;t, and give a plea&s;ing
variety to a fini&s;hed im|provement.</P>
<P>When the young are excluded, as they are numerous, voracious,
and importunate, the old ones are for ever upon the wing to provide them with
abundance. The quantity of fi&s;h they <PB N="400" REF="431"> take upon this
occa&s;ion is amazing, and their &s;ize is not le&s;s to be wondered at. I
remember a heron's ne&s;t that was built near a &s;chool-hou&s;e; the boys,
with their u&s;ual appetite for mi&s;chief, climbed up, took down the young
ones, &s;ewed up the vent, and laid them in the ne&s;t as before. The pain the
poor little animals felt from the operation encrea&s;ed their cries; and this
but &s;erved to encrea&s;e the diligence of the old ones in enlarging their
&s;upply. Thus they heaped the ne&s;t with various &s;orts of fi&s;h and the
be&s;t of their kind; and as their young &s;creamed they flew off for more. The
boys gathered up the fi&s;h, which the young ones were incapable of eating,
till the old ones at la&s;t quitted their ne&s;t, and gave up their brood,
who&s;e appetites they found it impo&s;&s;ible to &s;atisfy.</P>
<P>The heron is &s;aid to be a very long-lived bird; by Mr.
Key&s;ler's account it may exceed &s;ixty years; and by a recent in&s;tance of
one that was taken in Holland, by an hawk belong|ing to the &s;tadtholder, its
longevity is again confirmed, the bird having a &s;ilver plate fa&s;tened to
one leg, with an in&s;cription, importing that it had been &s;truck by the
elector of Cologne's hawks thirty-five years before.</P>
