<OPENER><DATELINE>The <HI>Lea&s;owes,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>Nov.</HI> 20, 1762.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>My deare&s;t Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is a very <HI>&s;urpri&s;ing</HI> and a <HI>cruel</HI> Thing,
that you will not &s;uppo&s;e me to have been <HI>out of Order,</HI> after
&s;uch a Neglect of writing, as can hardly be <HI>excu&s;ed</HI> on any
<HI>other</HI> Score. I cannot, indeed, lay Claim to what the Doctors call an
<HI>acute Di&s;ea&s;e:</HI> but <HI>Dizzi|ne&s;s of Head,</HI> and
<HI>Depre&s;&s;ion of Spirits</HI> are at <PB N="2" REF="11"> be&s;t no
<HI>trivial</HI> Maladies, and great <HI>Di&s;courage|ments</HI> to writing.
There is a lethargic State of <HI>Mind</HI> that de&s;erves your Pity, not your
Anger; though it may require the <HI>Hellebore</HI> of &s;harp Reproof. Why
then did you not apply this pungent Remedy, before the Di&s;ea&s;e was gone
&s;o far? But &s;eriou&s;ly, I pa&s;s too much of that Sort of Time, wherein I
am neither <HI>well</HI> nor <HI>ill</HI>; and being unable to ex|pre&s;s
my&s;elf at large, am aver&s;e to do &s;o by Halves. From the &s;trange
Laconici&s;m of your Letter, I am really in Doubt, whether you are not angry at
me; and yet had rather this were owing to <HI>Anger</HI> that <HI>may</HI>
&s;ub&s;ide, than to any per&s;evering <HI>Fondne&s;s</HI> you may have for
&s;uch unu&s;ual Brevity. Should the latter become habitual, I &s;hall &s;ee
the Letters of a Genius dwindle to 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>per fir&s;t will advi&s;e the
Needful.</HI>"</Q> God forbid &s;uch a Transformation!</P>
<P>Your <HI>former</HI> Letter, to my great Confu&s;ion, was dated
<HI>Sept.</HI> 18. Let me &s;peak fir&s;t to &s;ome few Parts of it&mdash;The
Lampreys arrived &s;afe, and were as good as I ever ta&s;ted; but every Time I
ta&s;ted them, I wanted <HI>you</HI>; and you are mi&s;|taken, 
<PB N="3" REF="12"> if you imagine, I can half reli&s;h &s;uch Cates
<HI>alone:</HI> however, I return you Thanks.</P>
<P>You gave me no Account how far the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> were judged expedient for you. A <HI>charitable</HI> Action
called you up to Town; and you, in the Benevolence of your Heart, pre&s;ume,
that this <HI>accounts for</HI> the Neglect of every Advantage that concerned
<HI>your&s;elf.</HI> Pray let me know whether the Bath was proper for you at
the &s;ame Time inform me, whe|ther you were able to &s;erve Mrs. H&mdash;. I
&s;hall be &s;orry for <HI>you,</HI> as well as <HI>her,</HI> if you &s;hould
mi&s;s the Gratification you would derive from the Succe&s;s of &s;uch an
Endeavour.</P>
<P>Were I rich, I would erect a Temple to <HI>Simplicity</HI> and
<HI>Grace</HI>; or, as the latter Word would be <HI>equivocal,</HI> to
<HI>Simplicity</HI> and <HI>Elegance.</HI> I am glad to hear that Mr. W&mdash; 
has under|taken to deify the <HI>former</HI>; as he will produce better
<HI>Grounds</HI> for &s;uch a <HI>Con&s;ecration</HI> than was ever done by
Pagans, or by Papi&s;ts, on any <HI>&s;uch</HI> Occa&s;ion. By the Way, I take
that God|de&s;s to be a remarkable Friend to Ea&s;e and In|dolence. There is
another well-de&s;erving Per|&s;onage, <PB N="4" REF="13"> <HI>Delicacy,</HI>
who&s;e Cau&s;e has been &s;trange|ly de&s;erted, by either Mr. MELMOTH, or Dr.
LANCASTER.</P>
<P>Will it make better for me, or wor&s;e, to &s;ay, I've not yet
written to Mr. GRAVES? But I will po&s;itively write, within this Week, if it
co&s;t me a Do&s;e of Salts to clear my Brain. As to what he &s;ays about my
printing im|mediately, he <HI>may</HI> be <HI>right,</HI> and I am
<HI>&s;ure</HI> he is <HI>friendly:</HI> but more of this in a little Time.</P>
<P>Since the Receipt of your la&s;t Letter, Mr. PERCY and his Wife came
and &s;pent a good Part of the Week here; and <HI>he,</HI> al&s;o, would needs
write a De&s;cription of the <HI>Lea&s;owes.</HI> Du|ring the latter Part of
his Circuit, my Friend JAGO and I accompanied him; and what was produced on
that Occa&s;ion, you will go near to know in a little Time. Mean while I am
more and more convinced, that no De&s;cription of this Place can make any
Figure in Print, unle&s;s &s;ome <HI>Strictures</HI> upon <HI>Gardening,</HI>
and <HI>other</HI> Embelli&s;hments be &s;uperadded.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="14">Mr. JAGO has been with me twice, having written a
Poem in blank Ver&s;e, which he leaves here for my Revi&s;al. 'Tis a
de&s;criptive Poem, called <HI>Edge-Hill,</HI> and admits an Account of the
Battle fought there, together with many legendary Tales and Epi&s;odes.</P>
<P>About a Week ago, I paid a Vi&s;it of two or three Days, which I had
long promi&s;ed, to Lord FOLEY. His Table, for a Con&s;tancy, is the mo&s;t
magnificent of any I ever &s;aw: eighteen or twenty elegant Di&s;hes; a
continual Succe&s;&s;ion of Company; his Behaviour, perfectly ho&s;pitable, and
his Conver&s;ation really entertaining. I mo&s;t readily own my&s;elf to have
been under a Mi&s;take, with Regard to his <HI>companionable</HI> Character. My
Reception was as agreeable as it could po&s;&s;ibly be. As to the re&s;t, he
has a mo&s;t admirable Hou&s;e and Furniture; but without any Room or Uten&s;il
that would &s;tand the Te&s;t of <HI>mo|dern</HI> Critici&s;m. The Views around
him, wild and great; and the Park capable of being rendered <HI>fine;
twice</HI> as &s;triking as it is at pre|&s;ent, if he would fell &s;ome Oaks,
under the Value of a Crown, and &s;ome Hawthorns, under <PB N="6" REF="15"> the
Value of a Half-penny: but 'tis po&s;&s;ible, at his Time of Life,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> nothing of this Sort will be undertaken. The two Things at
pre&s;ent remarkable are, his <HI>Lodge</HI> and his <HI>Chapel.</HI> The
Portico of the former, (de&s;igned by FLEET|CROFT) affords three different and
&s;triking Pro|&s;pects. The Chapel is &s;o very &s;uperb and ele|gant, that
Mrs. GATAKER has nothing to do but &s;end you and me <HI>thither,</HI> to &s;ay
our Prayers in it. In reality, it is perfect Luxury; as I truly thought it,
la&s;t <HI>Sunday</HI> Se'en-night; <HI>his Pew</HI> is a <HI>Room</HI> with an
hand&s;ome Fire-place; the Ceiling carved, painted in Compartments, and the
Remainder enriched with gilt Stucco-Ornaments; the Walls enriched in the &s;ame
Manner; the be&s;t painted Windows I ever &s;aw; the Monument to his Father,
Mother, and Bro|thers, co&s;t, he &s;aid, 2000<HI>l.</HI> the middle Ai&s;le
rendered comfortable by Iron Stoves, in the Shape of Urns; the Organ perfectly
neat, and good, in Proportion to its Size: and to this Chapel you are led
through a Gallery of Pain|tings &s;eventy Feet long&mdash;And what would you
more? You'll &s;ay, a good Sermon&mdash;I really think his Par&s;on is able to
preach one.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="16">And now I come, la&s;tly, to &s;peak of your
Letter I received on Monday. What an uncommon Man you are! to take &s;o much
Thought for <HI>tho&s;e,</HI> who never took <HI>any</HI> for
them&s;elves!&mdash;I have enquired after Mr. WEDDERBURNE, and it &s;eems he is
a very clever and a very ri&s;ing Lawyer; to whom I am the more obliged for
mentioning me, as I fear I have not the Honour of being the lea&s;t known to
him.</P>
<P>Pray write to me as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and I will make you
Amends (if <HI>Writing</HI> will make Amends) for the &s;candalous
<HI>Omi&s;&s;ions</HI> of which I have been guilty. I have &s;omewhat to tell
you of Lord L&mdash;'s u&s;ual <HI>great Kindne&s;s,</HI> when the Lords

<HEAD>LETTER II. W. SHENSTONE, E&s;q. to Mr. G&mdash;.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DID indeed give you up for lo&s;t, as a Corre&s;pondent, and find
by your Letter that I am to expect very few future ones. I will endeavour all I
can, to avoid any Su&s;|picion of your Indifference for my own Satis|faction;
but I don't know for certain, that I &s;hall be able, unle&s;s you a&s;&s;i&s;t
my Endeavours, like my good Genius, by a Cour&s;e of &s;uita|ble Epi&s;tles, at
certain Di&s;tances. I my&s;elf corre&s;pond but very little now, &s;o you will
meet with the more Indulgence. I don't find by your Letter that you have much
more Phi|lo&s;ophy than me. I can't tell, indeed, what the Situation of your
Hou&s;e is; I own, mine gives me Offence on no other Con&s;ideration, than that
it does not receive a &s;ufficient Num|ber of polite Friends, or that it is not
fit to receive them, were they &s;o di&s;po&s;ed; I would <PB N="9" REF="18">
el&s;e cultivate an Acquaintance with about three or four in my Neighbourhood,
that are of a Degree of Elegance and Station &s;uperior to the common run. But
I make it a certain Rule, 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Arcere profanum Vulgus</HI>".<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To bani&s;h the profane Vulgar.</NOTE></Q>&mdash;Per&s;ons who
will de&s;pi&s;e you for the Want of a good Set of Chairs, or an uncouth
Fire-Shovel, at the &s;ame Time that they can't ta&s;te any Excel|lence in a
Mind that overlooks tho&s;e Things; or (to make a Conceit of this Sentiment)
with whom 'tis in vain that your Mind is furni&s;h|ed, if the Walls are naked;
indeed, one lo&s;es much of one's Acqui&s;itions in Virtue, by an Hour's
Conver&s;e with &s;uch as judge of Merit by Money, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet I am
now and then im|pelled by the &s;ocial Pa&s;&s;ion to &s;it half an Hour in my
Kitchen.</P>
<P>I was all along an Admirer of Sir THOMAS HEAD's Humour and Wit, and
I beg you will repre&s;ent me in that Light, if Occa&s;ion happens. 'Tis not

<HEAD>LETTER III. W. SHENSTONE, E&s;q. to Mr. JAGO.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Mr. JAGO,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH I have not yet troubled you with a Letter, I have not been
void of all Enquiry, or Information concerning your Situation and Mr. HARDY's
Health; indeed, it is now many Weeks &s;ince I collected &s;ome Particulars
from your Brother, and I am now impatient for &s;ome further Intelligence. As
to the Particulars of our friendly Reception at <HI>Wroxhall,</HI> Mr. JOHN
JAGO has very probably acquainted you; he would, however, per&s;uade me to give
you a di&s;tinct Account; being a&s;|&s;ured, he &s;ays, it mu&s;t be a good
Subject for Drollery. I don't know how far this would be proper: but I think,
when I write again to my Friend W&mdash;, to give <HI>him</HI> a Sketch of his
own Character, ju&s;t as it appeared du|ring the Time of our Vi&s;it. I do not
mean to give Offence, &s;o I &s;hall intermix many <PB N="13" REF="22"> good
Parts of his Character, together with his Oddities. I believe the whole will
take up a Sheet of Paper, for I have already con&s;ider|ed it. He has
Good-Sen&s;e, and Good-Nature at the Bottom; pity he &s;hould di&s;gui&s;e the
former by one continued Air of Buffoonry, and the latter by a total Neglect of
common De|corum.</P>
<P>Since I came home, I have done little el&s;e but plant Bu&s;hes,
Hazel, Hawthorn, Crab-Tree, Elder, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> together with &s;ome few
flower|ing Shrubs that I have had given me. I think nothing remarkable has
occurred; only one mi|&s;erable tempe&s;tuous Day, I had the Earl of STAMFORD
called to &s;ee my Walks, together with Mr. DOVEY, of <HI>Birmingham,</HI> and
two other Gentlemen. My Lord promi&s;ed to come again in Summer, and invited me
to <HI>Enville.</HI> By the Way, he is now building a Gothic
<HI>Green-Hou&s;e,</HI> by Mr. M&mdash;'s Direction; and by all Accounts, the
Place is worth your &s;eeing, when you come into this Country; 'tis but about
&s;ix Miles di&s;tant from hence. Pray do not you embroil me with Mr. M&mdash;,
in Regard to the Ob&s;ervations I made in his <PB N="14" REF="23"> Walks.
Remember there were not a few Things with which I was greatly delighted; and if
there were a few that I le&s;s appeared to ad|mire, it was owing to a
Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, that I was among&s;t Friends only, and that I thought it
fooli&s;h to regulate my Expre&s;&s;ions by the &s;ame Rules of Complai&s;ance,
which I ought to ob&s;erve in different Places. I &s;ay, <HI>ought,</HI> for he
has been exceeding favourable to me, in his Repre&s;entations of the
<HI>Lea&s;owes.</HI> I hope to &s;ee Mr. FANCOURT with you here this Spring,
and why not your Brother? He can &s;pend half a Week now and then at
<HI>Wroxall.</HI> The Duke of S&mdash; was treated with Cruelty by his Fa|ther
till he was &s;ixty-five, and afterwards &s;carce &s;urvived him, to enjoy one
Year's Profit of the E&s;tate. Such is the Tenure by which we hold our earthly

<HEAD>LETTER IV. W. SHENSTONE, E&s;q. to Mr. WHISTLER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Mr. WHISTLER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS is the fir&s;t Evening I have had to my&s;elf &s;ince I left
<HI>Cheltenham</HI>; and as one wants &s;ome very favourite Subject to
en|gro&s;s one's Thoughts a little, after a long Di&s;&s;ipation, I could think
of nothing more ef|fectual than a Letter to one who has &s;o large a Share in
them; be&s;ide, they have given me your Letter from <HI>Bradfield,</HI> and I
am in Pain till I have acknowledged &s;o affectionate and polite a Pre&s;ent.
People, who&s;e very Foibles are &s;o many Elegancies, can &s;carce write any
Thing more agreeable than a plain, unaf|fected Account of them. I remember, I
u&s;ed to think this a Kind of Di&s;tinction between Mr. GRAVES and you; that
the one had the Knack of making his Virtues unenvied, and the other of
rendering (what I perhaps unju&s;tly termed) his Weakne&s;&s;es enviable. I am
al|mo&s;t <PB N="16" REF="25"> afraid of in&s;erting this, le&s;t it &s;hould
&s;eem to injure the &s;uperlative E&s;teem I have of you: but I mu&s;t add,
that I con&s;ider a Mixture of Weakne&s;&s;es, and an ingenuous Con|fe&s;&s;ion
of them, as the mo&s;t engaging and &s;o|ciable Part of any Character; if I did
not, I could not allot them you, who&s;e Manner is &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hedly
amiable.</P>
<P>Since I left <HI>Cheltenham,</HI> I have been at Mr. B&mdash;'s, in
<HI>Bi&s;hop's-Ca&s;tle.</HI> I rode one Morning with him about three Miles,
that I might &s;ay, I had been in <HI>Wales,</HI> and &s;een <HI>Brecon,
Caderi|dis,</HI> and <HI>Plinlimmon,</HI> with an exten&s;ive Chain of other
Mountains. I called at a &s;mall Ale|hou&s;e, where the People lived all the
Winter without any Gla&s;s in their Windows. I was wondering how they could
live &s;o, in a more cold Country than you have, perhaps, expe|rienced. The
Wife &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">"True it was, &s;he could like Gla&s;s very
well."</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Yes,"</Q> &s;ays the Hu&s;|band, 
<Q REND="inline">"Gla&s;s is very genteel, that it is."</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Nay,</Q> &s;ays the Wife, 
<Q REND="inline">"not for the Gentleelne&s;s nei|ther, though it is
very genteel, that's the Truth on't."</Q> This Circum&s;tance &s;truck me a
good deal, that they &s;hould di&s;cover the genteelne&s;s <PB N="17" REF="26">
of Glazing, and never once think of its <HI>Ex|pediency.</HI> Mr. B&mdash; is a
Man you would like upon Acquaintance, though, as I remember, you had &s;ome
Objection to the Superfluity of his Wit. We &s;hall, in all Probability, have
frequent Interviews with him at <HI>Bath, London, &amp;c.</HI> He would fain
have &s;educed me to have travelled into <HI>Portugal, &amp;c.</HI> with
him&s;elf, and one Mr. MOORE, his Neighbour; an agreeable, mode&s;t Man, and
late Member for <HI>Bi&s;hop's-Ca&s;tle.</HI> I declined it for two Rea&s;ons;
fir&s;t, on Ac|count of the Expence, and &s;econdly, that I could not think of
&s;pending two Years in <HI>this</HI> Part of my Life abroad; dead to one's own
Coun|try, and procuring, at be&s;t, very peri&s;hable, and u&s;ele&s;s
Friend&s;hips in another. If I could have &s;taid, I was to have gone with him
to a <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> Se&s;&s;ions, fraught with Ira&s;cibility. He is a
Ju&s;tice of Peace there.</P>
<P>As to good Acquaintance, though I much de&s;ire it, I have as
literally a Genius for avoid|ing, as any one ever had for procuring it. I
cannot approach within fifty Yards of Servi|lity for fear of it.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="27">I want &s;adly to talk to you about a
thou|&s;and Things. I have &s;ome Notion of &s;pend|ing a Week at Mr.

notwith&s;tand|ing.</P>
<P>Though I was enamoured with the Polite|ne&s;s of Mr. W&mdash;'s
Conver&s;ation, I &s;hould not, perhaps, have been very forward to expre&s;s my
Sentiments, if you had not intimated, that he made favourable mention of me. I
begin to grow a little plea&s;ed with Prudence, and I think it a Debt one owes
her, to re&s;erve one's Encomiums till one knows any one's mu|tual Sentiments;

it mu&s;t be a Di&s;graee to captivate a Fool, however high it be; the former

<P>WHEN I promi&s;ed you &s;ome Poetry for Mr. S&mdash;, I am afraid
that, through my De&s;ire of recommending my&s;elf to his Family, my Tongue
out-run my Wit. If I laid any Sort of <HI>Stre&s;s</HI> upon what I was to

<P>It is probable, however, that I had an Eye to a larger Ode of mine,
upon the Subject of rural Elegance, which I have not now Time either to correct

<P>Or if my Promi&s;e regarded a Tran&s;lation of the Mottos

<P>Am I wrong in detaining that Paper?&mdash;For po&s;itively, the&s;e
la&s;t few Days I have found my&s;elf a good deal feveri&s;h, and my Head has
been &s;o much confu&s;ed, that I was almo&s;t tempted to omit this

of <HI>Di&s;re&s;pect:</HI> but I could not &s;uffer you to leave the Country

<P>It remains, that I pre&s;ent my be&s;t Re&s;pects to Dr. TURTON and

<P>I Received your agreeable Letter; read all the fine Things your (I
fear prejudiced) Good-nature made you &s;ay; at fir&s;t di&s;tru&s;ted them:
but when I reflected on the Per&s;on who &s;aid them, I found a &s;trong
Inclination ri&s;e in me to believe them; but how to be convinced I was &s;till
at a Lo&s;s; for I know it is in your Power, either to make Flattery pa&s;s for
Sincerity, or Sincerity (&s;o ju&s;tly dreaded from <PB N="23" REF="32"> the
Un&s;kilful) plea&s;ing. But be it as it will, I &s;hall be a Gainer by it; for
if 'tis Flattery, it will give me a fair Reputation, though un|de&s;erved, with
all who hear it; but if 'tis true, it will a&s;&s;ure me, I de&s;erve one from
all who can like you be&s;tow one.</P>
<P>You enquired after Mr. D&mdash;. He, and his Lady, and Mi&s;s
B&mdash;s, have drank Tea with me twice within this Fortnight. We went to
<HI>Chri&s;t-Church</HI> Prayers together, from thence, arrayed in Gold and
Silver, we ru&s;hed into <HI>St. John's-Chapel,</HI> where we &s;tood, knelt
and &s;ate, (I won't &s;ay prayed) the whole Service-Time; for you know it is
u&s;ual there for Strangers to &s;it in the Choir, which we did, to the great
Advantage both of the Fan and the Snuff-Box, which were neither of them long
unemployed, during Divine Service. You know they are great Helps to Devotion:
Snuff cer|tainly compo&s;es, and a Fan may waft a Soul to Heaven before it is

<P>Mrs. L&mdash; &s;till per&s;everes. She gave it out before &s;he had
&s;een her, that Mi&s;s B&mdash; was like a Cat, which when &s;he found Mi&s;s

Mrs. L&mdash; topt Mrs. L&mdash;'s Part. Mr. G&mdash; is &s;till a Prude; I
&s;ee him &s;ometimes, but &s;hould be glad to &s;ee him of|tener. I know no
one Circum&s;tance, but Breach of Sincerity, that can ever be a Rea&s;on with
me to &s;light my Friends. If a Friend of mine had broke all Laws, both human
and divine, yet had con&s;picuou&s;ly pre&s;erved his Integrity to me, I
&s;hould only think my&s;elf the more obliged to him, and though I pitied him,
would never for&s;ake him fir&s;t; I &s;hould think he had a higher Notion of
Friend&s;hip, and that that was the only Tie which he dared not violate, for
which Rea&s;on I would not dare to be a greater Villain than he. I don't know
how this Thought came into my Head, but you &s;ee I was willing to &s;pin it to
its full Length; if I have gone too far, you mu&s;t impute it to that Rapture

<P>I Received your kind Letter, and, in Spite of all you have &s;aid, I
mu&s;t &s;till think that the Obligation is entirely on my Side, and you have
only, in my Opinion, laid a greater Stre&s;s upon it by &s;o generou&s;ly
di&s;claiming it. I am re&s;olved to be plea&s;ed with every Thing you &s;ay or

me a Vi&s;it; but am likewi&s;e very &s;orry, I mu&s;t beg you to defer it for
&s;ome Time; our Family talk of going to <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> very &s;oon, and as
I have no where el&s;e to go, mu&s;t go with them. If it was in my Power to
defer the Journey, I would gladly do it, to wait on Mr. SHEN|STONE, at

their Ab|&s;ence and his Pre&s;ence would be to me a dou|ble Happine&s;s. But
as it is, I mu&s;t, at pre&s;ent, <PB N="29" REF="38"> be without a Plea&s;ure,
which I hope will not always thus fly from me; I hope the lat-End of this

&s;hall reckon that the Spring of the Year is yet to come; I, who place the
Sea&s;ons en|tirely in my own Fancy.</P>
<P>I forgot to tell you in my la&s;t, that the Prin|ce&s;s AMELIA did
us the Honour of a Vi&s;it at <HI>Whitchurch,</HI> though we were obliged to
the Stag for it, who &s;eemed to fly from the Ho|nour &s;he de&s;igned him, and
had not Ambition enough (as LEE &s;ays) to meet the Blow half Way, or be
plea&s;ed with Death, though in the Royal Pre&s;ence. It was a terrible Day,
and the Prince&s;s was wet through; &s;he had rode thirty Miles when I &s;aw
her, and &s;he rode thirty Miles after that, which was &s;ix o'Clock at Night,
in her wet Cloaths, and appeared at the Drawing-Room at St. <HI>James</HI>'s,
the next Day, which was a Birth-Day.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s (with Submi&s;&s;ion be it &s;poke) gave me no
Satisfaction, not through any De|ficiency in her Demeanour&mdash;but from the
di&s;|&s;atisfied <PB N="30" REF="39"> State of Mind. I could be contented with
nothing le&s;s than you; and I hope you will be &s;o good, as not to let this
Di&s;appoint|ment, which I a&s;&s;ure you is a great Di&s;appoint|ment to me,

<HEAD>LETTER IX. Mr. WHISTLER to W. SHENSTONE, E&s;q.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE not received your Letter above a Week ago, being but lately
come to Town, which is the true Rea&s;on why I have not an|&s;wered it. Few
Rea&s;ons, and none but good ones &s;hall ever prevent me from pre&s;enting my
Heart to you: but my Journey hither has been prevented, partly by ill Health,
and partly by little, ill-natured, impertinent Accidents&mdash;This
Su&s;pen&s;e had had an equal Effect on my writing to you. I here end my mo&s;t
&s;incere Apology.</P>
<P>Now for News&mdash;I am in <HI>London</HI>; for which Rea&s;on, I
&s;uppo&s;e I mu&s;t not be excu&s;ed; tho' I hate it, remember very little,
and am mo&s;t likely to blunder in the Recital of that little. The Hou&s;e of
Commons have addre&s;&s;ed the King to try MATTHEWS and LESTOCK, and &s;ix
Captains, by a Court-Martial, and it is <PB N="32" REF="41"> thought, &s;ome of
them will be condemned.&mdash;Poor GARRICK has been dangerou&s;ly ill of a
Fever this Week: but now, to my great Sa|tisfaction, there are Hopes of his
Recovery; nay, it is noticed in the <HI>Daily Adverti&s;er,</HI> that he will
perform a Part next <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> Night.</P>
<P>I have been to wait on Lord D&mdash;. He was very civil, and would
fain have kept me till he had opened his Heart with a Bottle of Wine; at
lea&s;t, I imagined his forwarding the Bottle was with that De&s;ign; but I was
engaged. I am to call upon him to go to <HI>Ranelagh</HI>&mdash;a Lord would be
a pretty No&s;egay in one's Hand, if he had the lea&s;t Variety of Colours;
nay, if he re&s;embled any one Flower of a &s;ingle Co|lour, except the
<HI>Fu&s;tus.</HI> Mr. F&mdash; I &s;ee &s;ome|times, but he is not very
attractive. I always did envy you the Power of Laughing at a Fool by
your&s;elf: but you are a World within your&s;elf. Mr. P&mdash;K, I &s;pent an
Evening with lately very agreeably: but he lives &s;o far off, at the Court-End
of the Town, as &s;eparates us very much. Mr. P&mdash;N I often &s;ee, and find
him a very u&s;eful Per&s;on. But if you were here, both agreeable and u&s;eful
would <PB N="33" REF="42"> vani&s;h, and a far &s;uperior Enjoyment take Place.
Mr. GRAVES promi&s;ed to be in <HI>London</HI> for a Week, but his little
Politics are, you know, very uncertain. I have &s;truck a bold Stroke &s;ince I
have been in Town; I mean a laced Coat, for really Wai&s;tcoats co&s;t as much,
and are no Mark of Di&s;tinction after all. Sir T. HEAD comes to Town this
Week; but I believe, I &s;hall not &s;tay above a Week longer, &s;o would have
you direct to me at <HI>Whitchurch.</HI> I de&s;ign to go to Court one Night. I
mu&s;t, as you &s;ee, write &s;hort, my Paper drawing to an End. It is with
Plea&s;ure I hear, that old People confe&s;s a Play is now worth &s;eeing, and
that GARRICK excels BETTERTON, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In the Diver&s;ity of his
Genius, he mu&s;t far exceed him; when we &s;ee him alternately in a
<HI>Rich|ard</HI> and <HI>Scrub,</HI> in a <HI>Lear,</HI> and <HI>Abel
Drugger,</HI> he is truly a&s;toni&s;hing. This Excellence of our dramatic
Repre&s;entations is another Rea&s;on to wi&s;h you here. CAMPIONI is a
charming new Dancer. The <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> was performed la&s;t Night, but I
could not go.&mdash;But I mu&s;t write no more Tattle. I have ju&s;t been with
Mr. SHUGBO|ROUGH, and gave him your Orders about the Pamphlets, and have picked
out &s;ome my&s;elf, <PB N="34" REF="43"> <HI>viz.</HI> the Odes, the new Play,
and the Poem on <HI>Sickne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>I wi&s;h there had been any better Prints to have enclo&s;ed in this
Letter; I &s;hould have been glad to have &s;ent them. The Pamphlets I have
ordered to be &s;ent immediately, directed to be left at Mr. AUDLEY's, in
<HI>Birmingham.</HI> The Regret I always feel for your Ab&s;ence will ever
in&s;truct me how to value you, that is beyond what the elaborate Conclu&s;ion
of a Letter can expre&s;s; therefore I will not endea|vour to &s;ay how much,
but in an unlimited Manner be fond to remain</P>

<P>I Generally write to you, becau&s;e I want to hear from you; but
having lately wrote to you, I now write becau&s;e I want to &s;ee you. In
&s;hort the Ca&s;e is this: I &s;hall be at <HI>Oxford</HI> in about three

Time I &s;hall be there, I mean in my Gown. Now as I am willing &s;till to
retain an agree|able Image of the Place where I have &s;pent &s;o many happy
Hours, I make this Reque&s;t, that you would &s;tamp the la&s;t Impre&s;&s;ion
upon my Mind. I beg you would meet me there, and give me the Confirmation of
your Friend|&s;hip, which I &s;hall e&s;teem a greater Honour than all the
Degrees the formal Convocation can be&s;tow; and I think of you, as JUBA does
of CATO, and declare, I would rather have your Prai&s;e, than Worlds for my
Ad|mirers. <PB N="36" REF="45"> I have forgot the Mea&s;ure, but this is
directly my Sentiment.</P>
<P>I lately wrote you a long Letter, as you were &s;o kind to de&s;ire;
and in &s;o very lazy unintellectual a Manner, that I am &s;ure half the
Mortals, who only under&s;tand with their Eyes and by the Grammar, could never
have comprehended: but I would conver&s;e with you Soul to Soul, have a Hint
under&s;tood by you, and not be obliged to a tedious Pe|riod to communicate a
Thought to you; I would have my Soul &s;tand naked before you, and &s;hiver at

<P>AS Hope is the chief Spring of all our Actions, and as Plea&s;ure is
the &s;ole Ob|ject of that Hope, you mu&s;t not wonder if the Stile of this
Letter appears more languid than u&s;ual. How quickly is the Tran&s;ition
of|ten made from Hope to De&s;pair! But a little <PB N="38" REF="47"> While,
and I thought I already &s;aw you; and now I am pre&s;ently fallen into the
De&s;pera|tion of I know not when. The Small-Pox, which generally frightens
away every Thing that's agreeable, has made it impo&s;&s;ible for me to &s;ee
you as yet&mdash;The la&s;t Sentence &s;eems a Compliment to my&s;elf; but as I
am too lazy to alter it, I beg you would think with me, and interpret every
Thing I &s;ay in your own Favour. But thus the Devil will have it; the
Small-Pox is all over <HI>Oxford,</HI> in every Part of the Town, in mo&s;t of
the Colleges to my Knowledge, and is lately broke out in <HI>Pembroke.</HI> If
it had not been for this la&s;t Ar|ticle, I could gladly have confined my&s;elf
within the Compa&s;s of tho&s;e Walls with you; but as it is, I am forced, like
good Men, to &s;ubmit for a While to human Mi&s;eries, and comfort my&s;elf
with the Thought of my Hea|ven, though at a Di&s;tance; like them too, I have
this Satisfaction, that in the mean Time neither the ba&s;e Moth, or Ru&s;t of
the World, can corrupt that Part of you in which my Plea&s;ure is
&s;ituated.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="48">I have a very bad Piece of News to tell you; Mr.

his Life is de&s;pair|ed of&mdash;I am now in the utmo&s;t Concern at it. This
Letter is a mere Medley: di&s;agreeable to my&s;elf, I don't propo&s;e it to be
agreeable to you. I only wrote it, to tell you what you mu&s;t know, and if you
can under&s;tand it, it is very well. I am not only in the lowe&s;t Spirits,
but they are al&s;o very much confu&s;ed. I will not now moralize; but this I
am &s;ure, we &s;hall both dearly mi&s;s Mr. G&mdash;. When I hear more, you
&s;hall know more. It is now one o'Clock in the Morning, and, as I told you, I
wrote this out of Nece&s;&s;ity. I cannot be in <HI>Oxford,</HI> though I long
to &s;ee you. If poor Mr. G&mdash; &s;hould die, pray be &s;till more kind to
me. I am &s;ure, I &s;hall then find a Vacancy in my Brea&s;t, which you alone

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR la&s;t kind Letter has for a long Time upbraided me with
Negligence, Ingrati|tude and Stupidity. To the la&s;t Part of the Accu&s;ation,
I plead guilty; for I think I never found my&s;elf more &s;tupid than I have
been for this Month pa&s;t, and what I write now, proceeds, not from any Flow
of Fancy, but merely from Re&s;pect and E&s;teem. I have <PB N="41" REF="50">
been very much taken up of late, by our Fa|mily being at Home: but that
Excu&s;e I lay no Stre&s;s upon; for I &s;hall never let any, ei|ther
Bu&s;ine&s;s or Plea&s;ure hurry you from my Thoughts. Ill Health can be my
only ju&s;t Apology; and though I cannot &s;ay I have been &s;ick, I can
a&s;&s;ure you, I have not been well for &s;ome Time pa&s;t. Put my Condition
in the be&s;t Light, I am very much in the Va|pours, and &s;o much, as that you
or Mr. GRAVES alone can cure me: a Letter from you will go a great deal towards
it; though I long for one, I can hardly go on with this Letter, which is the
Means to procure it; like one &s;inking into a fainting Fit, who can't collect
Strength of Mind or Body, to reach &s;o much as the Hart&s;horn to his No&s;e,
which &s;tands at his Elbow. I &s;hall be at <HI>Oxford</HI> in a &s;hort Time,
and &s;pend as many Days there as I can pa&s;s agreeably, and then take my
Leave of it. If the Town be healthy, I &s;hall go to <HI>London</HI> the
Beginning of the Winter, and &s;tay there ju&s;t as long as it &s;miles on me.
But all Things &s;eem to frown in the Ab&s;ence of my Friends, and I wi&s;h I

<P>IF you remember, in your la&s;t Letter but one, you advi&s;ed me to
read Hi&s;tory: ac|cordingly, as I am always proud to follow your Advice, I
pitched upon BURNET's <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> <PB N="43" REF="52"> <HI>of his own
Times.</HI> I was over Head and Ears engaged in the Di&s;putes between
Cavaliers, Pro|te&s;ters, Re&s;olutioners, and God knows who, when I received
your la&s;t. Though BURNET values him&s;elf particularly on private
Intelli|gence, I had a greater Curio&s;ity, and enter|tained far greater Hopes
of Plea&s;ure, in break|ing open your Letter; nor was I at all de|ceived: I
think you wrote, if po&s;&s;ible, more agreeably than u&s;ual; it rai&s;ed my
Spirits, and at the &s;ame Time did more than all King CHARLES's State&s;men
could do: &s;et up an ab|&s;olute Monarchy in my Brea&s;t in a Moment, and made

<P>Mr. POWYS had a Child chri&s;tened ye&s;ter|day; it was attended to

Mrs. POWYS went out on Plea&s;ure to the la&s;t, and if her Hor&s;es had not
been good, and her Coachman dexterous to ply them with the Whip, &s;he had been

<P>As to what you mentioned about your Poem; you can't think me &s;uch
a Barbarian, as that I &s;hould expect you &s;hould follow my Advice in every
Particular; I rather think you did me an Honour in doing it at all. I know the
great Critics have been long endeavouring to be ab|&s;olute; but I think it
very unrea&s;onable even in them&mdash;and I believe you, as well as my|&s;elf,
have too much Spirit to &s;ubmit to it. If I can any Ways a&s;&s;i&s;t you, by
any little Ob&s;ervations, you &s;hall have my Thoughts, and make u&s;e of them

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received you Pacquet, fraught with every Thing that could delight
me. I believe more Wit was never conveyed under the Title of a Peer before; not
even excepting your own, which, indeed, you generally export by whole&s;ale in
the &s;ame Method. Your Letter led me through an Ely&s;ian Scene, which
de|lighted me &s;o, that I mu&s;t beg Leave to take another Turn with you at
pre&s;ent therein. There is no Subject I can treat of with &s;o much
Plea&s;ure, and, of Con&s;equence, with &s;o much Advantage to my&s;elf. In the
fir&s;t Place, Dick J&mdash;, in the Point of Light you &s;et him, diverts me;
yet Humanity teaches me to feel a Kind of Pity, as for an Animal that &s;ings
and hops about the Cage that has ju&s;t de|prived him of his Liberty. Lady
LUXBOROUGH I have &s;een, but not in her Sanctuary, where <PB N="47" REF="56">
&s;he delivers her Oracles, and di&s;plays her Elo|quence and Elegancies at
full. This is what my Soul is a-thir&s;t after; the holy Land of a future
Pilgrimage. You have rai&s;ed a Devotion in me towards her; for we always judge
of the Divinity by the Merits of the Prie&s;t. By your De&s;cription of Mr.
THOMSON, I admire him, and rejoice in your Acquaintance with him. I beg you
would cultivate it, for it &s;eems like the Dawning of your Fame, who&s;e Merit
the &s;tupid World only wants to be awakened to &s;ee. If ever you get your due
Share of Fame, I in&s;i&s;t that you be not a Niggard of it, as many are, but
do your ut|mo&s;t Endeavour to communicate it to your Friends&mdash;You &s;ee I
&s;peak in Time.</P>
<P>As for Mr. L&mdash;N's Civility, I have no great Faith in it; I fear
he has only &s;ome private End to &s;erve, as an Election or &s;o: but,
how|ever, I would have you nouri&s;h it, for it may breed &s;omething by
Chance&mdash;It will be a Cre|dit to you at wor&s;t&mdash;Chance often promotes
Lingerers at Court, who have otherwi&s;e very little Hope. It may fall out,
that by &s;erving <PB N="48" REF="57"> you, he may &s;erve him&s;elf. I
&s;hould like to have &s;een Signor OUTING, poor Man.</P>
<P>I think the <HI>Lea&s;owes</HI> a charming Place in it&s;elf; but
not knowing how in my Imagina|tion at any Time to &s;eparate the Work from the
Architect, I believe I give the former infinitely more Adoration than its due,
even with all its Improvements. You would often &s;ee me gliding acro&s;s the
Glades, if the Soul was vi&s;ible. You, indeed, have contrived to make your
Soul, as it were, vi&s;ible; and a very beautiful Soul it is; particularly in
its la&s;t Dre&s;s, which became it exceedingly, I mean Elegy&mdash;It was
mighty well fancied, and dif|fu&s;ed a tender, langui&s;hing Air, its highe&s;t
Cha|racter: I am much indebted to it for this &s;plen|did Vi&s;it; &s;pendid I
mean in Beauty. The two old Songs likewi&s;e were very agreeable to me: but
chiefly <HI>Giles Collins.</HI> As for the Song of the <HI>Cat,</HI> I am much
obliged to you for it: but I think the Author &s;unk quite beneath him&s;elf
towards the End. The Conclu&s;ion was too &s;udden, and not worked up enough,
and be&s;ides was exceeding dirty; however, it was improved by your
Alterations: upon the whole, I <PB N="49" REF="58"> like it, and out of my
Devotion for the five fir&s;t Stanzas, I have added &s;ix more, which I
&s;ubmit to your Judgment, whether I have &s;upported the true Spirit of the
Fragment. Pray excu&s;e that I have pre&s;umed to omit any of your Alterations;
becau&s;e I thought in this new Scheme the Context required it.</P>
<P>I live in Hopes of &s;eeing you at <HI>Whitchurch</HI> this Winter,
and of hearing the happy Tidings when; I beg you will let me know &s;ome Time
before you come, that I may get your Bed in order; I have but one; (it was
given me, and is none of the large&s;t; indeed, &s;mall, which at pre&s;ent I
lament) otherwi&s;e I &s;hould now give more Invitations; I can entertain but
one Friend at a Time: but all my Friends will be &s;incerely welcome
&s;everally. Again I &s;ay, I lament the Un&s;ociablene&s;s of this Scheme, but
it is not in my Power to alter it. Mr. G&mdash;'s Affair goes on, I am afraid,
unhappi|ly. As for my own Situation, I &s;hall &s;ay lit|tle, but leave you to
take a Survey of it, which I hope you will do &s;oon. I think it is cal|culated
for Happine&s;s, if a Per&s;on of the lea&s;t <HI>Delicate&s;&s;e</HI> can be

<P>I have had a Swelling in my Foot, which they tell me is the
Gout&mdash;God forbid!&mdash;but 'tis certainly like it. I intend to go into a
Milk Diet immediately, for I am terribly alarmed. If it &s;hould prove &s;o, I
&s;hall think it a very hard Fate, having been no Drinker, and even

<P>It was not our Mr. POWYS's Landau, for he was at Home, and be&s;ides

<HEAD>LETTER XVI. Mr. WHISTLER to W. SHENSTONE, E&s;q.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been extremely bu&s;y of late in new modelling my little
Habitation; and the more &s;o, to bring it to &s;ome Kind of Perfec|tion, in
Order to receive you. I have been building up, pulling down, planting, rooting
up, turning Round to Square, and Square to Round. In &s;hort, I don't know, but
&s;ome <PB N="54" REF="63"> prudent People would &s;ay, I have been playing the
Devil. Indeed, (as in other Things in Life) my Fancy is &s;o confined by the
Smallne&s;s of my Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, that my Scheme is not very expen&s;ive:
'tis all in the <HI>Lilliputian</HI> Stile, and mu&s;t be &s;o. Though I have
tried to give it what Air of Magnificence it is capable of, I &s;uppo&s;e it
will &s;trut like many of tho&s;e un|fortunate Heroes who happen not to be four
Feet and a Half high.</P>
<P>Did Lady LUXBOROUGH approve my Senti|ment of enjoying Things be&s;t
by Reflection? I &s;till maintain my Opinion, and endeavour to ju&s;|tify it
thus: What we enjoy by Reflection we have pure, nay, heightened by our own
Fancy, at the &s;ame Time no Inconvenience attends it; on the contrary, the
Plea&s;ure is more poignant by the Contra&s;t. The Thought of an Ice-Hou&s;e in
the Summer is refre&s;hing, and the Imagination of <HI>July</HI> is a Cordial
in Fro&s;t and Snow; be&s;ides, you well know Hope is the very Hart&s;horn of
Life, that enlivens every Thing, and particularly attends imaginary
Plea&s;ures, but vani&s;hes whenever they become real&mdash;By Reflection, I
mean Imagination in general.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="64">I have &s;ent you Stanzas on Flowers. If Lady
LUXBOROUGH likes them, I &s;hall be proud of hitting the Pallate of a Lady of
&s;o high a Ta&s;te. I have likewi&s;e enclo&s;ed another Copy of
Ver&s;es&mdash;though I am in Doubt, whether I did not &s;end them to you
la&s;t Summer; they were done then. I know you don't love Tran&s;la|tions, but
I have nothing new be&s;ides. I &s;et about them merely as an Exerci&s;e one
Night, when I was dull and alone, not intending any Thing but tearing them
afterwards, for I knew it was a worn-out Subject&mdash;But a fatherly
Af|fection took Place, and I did not care for mur|dering it, though it was a
Ba&s;tard produced unawares.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> I beg that nothing of mine may ap|pear in Print.</P>
<P>I admire tho&s;e two Lines of Lady WORTLEY's very much. It is a
natural yet uncommon and agreeable Thought. I am plea&s;ed with the Com|pliment
you make me, in &s;aying you always wi&s;h me with you to partake any
Plea&s;ure, and imagine how any Thing extraordinary would <PB N="56" REF="65">
&s;trike me: I like it, becau&s;e I know it is a natural, and thereby, a
&s;incere Thought by my own Heart. I am &s;o far gone that Way, that I can
hardly enjoy any Thing extraordinary, without my Friends are with me,
e&s;pecially tho&s;e whom I know it would particularly &s;trike: but next to
gratifying a Friend, is the ob&s;er|ving, how new and extraordinary Objects
work upon a natural Genius; I'll &s;uppo&s;e it a Ge|nius; I think it is one of
the highe&s;t Enter|tainments in Life; when I can meet with &s;uch, and have an
Opportunity, I love to read a Play to them, though I know I run the Ha|zard of
being laughed at for my Pains; but I don't care, the Plea&s;ure pays me for all
the malicious fooli&s;h People can &s;ay, and you know the natural Critici&s;ms
of Sir ROGER DE COVER|LEY were not thought unworthy the Notice of the
<HI>Briti&s;h Spectator.</HI> For my Part, I have of|ten thought that it is one
of the Amu&s;ements of the Supreme Being, who planted fir&s;t the Pa&s;&s;ions
in us, to ob&s;erve the Workings and Effects of them. A public Audience gives
me Plea&s;ure upon Tru&s;t, for though I know no one there, I always conclude
there are &s;ome Geniu&s;&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="66">I am of your Opinion, with Regard to Mrs.
&mdash;, at pre&s;ent, for I think, if her Heart be really engaged, which I
very much doubt, Di&s;honour in Love is the blacke&s;t of all di&s;hone&s;t
Actions, and of the wor&s;t Con&s;e|quence&mdash;But his precur&s;ive Steps
were the Ex|tremity of Folly, conducted with the Extremity of Folly; but he may
be happy (and I wi&s;h he may be happy) in any State of Life. I think our
Vi&s;its to DICK J&mdash; are fatal; his own Mother lay a dying when we were at
<HI>Henley.</HI> I am very glad to hear you have had &s;o many Amu&s;ements. It
is always agree|able to me, whenever I hear you have met with a flowery Meadow
in your &s;ublunary Walk. If I have any Ta&s;te, your <HI>Hercules</HI> is an
elegant and truly poetical Poem, and &s;u|perior to L&mdash;'s: if it is not, I
re&s;ign my Ta&s;te, for I'll pin it upon your Poem. I don't pretend to
Critici&s;m; but my Pa&s;&s;ion for SHAKESPEARE, MILTON, POPE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
has made me believe, that I have &s;ome natural Ta&s;te for Beauty. I am much
obliged to you for the two genteel Copies of Ver&s;es; they are very pretty,
and much to my Fancy. As for Odes, <PB N="58" REF="67"> you have expre&s;&s;ed
my Sen&s;e of them all on that of Dr. AKENSIDE; they perplex and fret one more
than they plea&s;e, and may be de|&s;cribed by the Title of one of
SHAKESPEARE's Plays, <HI>viz. Much Ado about Nothing.</HI></P>
<P>I have no News to &s;end you from hence, that will be in the lea&s;t
entertaining to you. I am in Hopes Mr. GRAVES will &s;ettle at
<HI>Whitchurch</HI> about <HI>Whit&s;untide.</HI> I have been much out of Order
for this Week, by a Cold that I caught in attending my Works; and my Foot gives
me ugly Apprehen&s;ions at pre|&s;ent. I continually plea&s;e my&s;elf with the
Thoughts of &s;eeing you at <HI>Whitchurch</HI>; but would never have you make
an Inconvenience of what I would have be a Plea&s;ure to you&mdash;I'd have you
choo&s;e your own Time, that you may be quite unembarra&s;&s;ed: for my Part, I
think the &s;ooner the better; only I would beg the Favour of one Line to
prevent all ill Ac|cidents. I think 'tis a Method which &s;hould ever be
u&s;ed; and I wonder at my own Im|prudence, and my own Good Fortune la&s;t Time
I came to the <HI>Lea&s;owes.</HI> I long to &s;ee you, and &s;hall be all this
Summer at <HI>Whit|church,</HI> <PB N="59" REF="68"> ready to receive you.
Indeed, if I &s;hould have the Gout, as I &s;omething fear it, I would let you
know, for that would inter|rupt all our Plea&s;ure. I beg my Compliments to Mr.
DOLMAN: you have likewi&s;e the Com|pliments of this Place. With Wi&s;hes to
&s;ee you, and Compliments grounded upon the ut|mo&s;t Sincerity, I am,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVII. Mr. WHISTLER to W. SHENSTONE, E&s;q.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Mr. SHENSTONE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU &s;ee that I am as eager to an&s;wer your Letter as you was to
an&s;wer mine, and if my Letter gave you Pain, I a&s;&s;ure you, that yours has
equally perplexed me. I am <PB N="60" REF="69"> in great Hopes, you have
mi&s;interpreted my Sen&s;e, in Regard to Mr. G&mdash;; and by as much as I can
recollect, I believe you have. He always &s;peaks of you with the utmo&s;t
Re|&s;pect in your Ab&s;ence, and is much le&s;s &s;evere even upon what he
calls your little Faults, than when you are pre&s;ent: all that I hinted at,
was &s;ome little Shyne&s;s he lately &s;hewed to me, on the Account which you
and I have often mentioned. I have heard you &s;ay, you have experienced the
&s;ame from him on the like Score. But you could not po&s;&s;ibly be now
included, being ab&s;ent; no, I a&s;&s;ure you, I only &s;poke of my&s;elf; and
his Fault towards me would have been imperceptible, but to the Delicacy of
Friend&s;hip; nor been have worth communicating, but to one whom my Love would
animate again&s;t the like Failing. I de|clare to you, the Sentence which
included Mr. G&mdash;'s Name, was the only one which regarded him; what
followed, though I confe&s;s that gave Ri&s;e to it, was only to &s;hew my
different Sentiments, and I own my E&s;teem for Friend|&s;hip carried me a
great Length. I have been very particular to &s;atisfy you, as well as to
ju&s;tify Mr. G&mdash;, and by that Means to ju&s;|tify <PB N="61" REF="70">
my&s;elf. I &s;hould have never have for|given my&s;elf, if I had been the
Cau&s;e, though inadvertently, of dividing &s;o much Worth as I have always
di&s;covered in you both, and which though &s;eparated, it might &s;till
continue to ble&s;s me, yet when united, like mo&s;t other Things, it has a
more powerful Effect. I would not have Mr. G&mdash; know a Word of this, for
the mo&s;t trifling Reflection, when told again, is offen&s;ive; nor &s;hould I
have &s;aid what I did, but to a common Friend; in Truth, it is not every-body
who po&s;&s;ibly might feel it &s;o acutely as my&s;elf; but you know my
Di&s;po&s;ition. I have a Sen&s;ibility in my Friend&s;hips, that ari&s;es even
to a <HI>Sorene&s;s,</HI> and the &s;lighte&s;t Air of Coolne&s;s makes me
wince. This, though in its Con&s;equences &s;ometimes it may render me
unplea&s;ing to my Intimates, certainly has its Source in a Merit, namely, in
the <HI>Ardour</HI> of my Attachments; and therefore I &s;hould hope is
ea&s;ily pardonable. You remember the ele|gant Line in COTTON's beautiful
Vi&s;ion of Friend&s;hip; 
<Q>"Cold is the only Ill they fear."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="71">After I had &s;ealed my la&s;t, I was afraid it
had rather an Air of Compliment than Since|rity; if it had, I a&s;&s;ure you,
it was only the <HI>Air,</HI> and what the Good-humour, I am always in when I
write to you, might in&s;pire me with. You &s;ee the E&s;teem I have for you,
by turn|ing Critic on my&s;elf in your Behalf. I am now going to mention, what
there is no Occa|&s;ion at all to &s;ay, but Friend&s;hip is the mo&s;t
incontinent Thing in the World; I have long been &s;en&s;ible of your Worth;
that is, ever &s;ince I knew you; but I mu&s;t &s;ay, I think it was our la&s;t
Meeting which entirely united me to you; every Letter of yours &s;ince has
heigh|tened my Affection for you. I look upon this as my fir&s;t Ab&s;ence from
you; your Letters are now nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upply your Pre&s;ence; you
your&s;elf taught me this Ta&s;te of Luxury, therefore it is but rea&s;onable
you &s;hould &s;up|port the Expence. In &s;hort, I beg you would write &s;oon.
I am afraid I &s;hall tire you by &s;o frequent a Corre&s;pondence, but I

<P>I Fancy I've been condemned a Thou&s;and Times, on Account of not

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Promi&s;ed to give you &s;ome Account what became of
<HI>Cheltenham,</HI> after Mr. A&mdash; had pillaged it of all that was mo&s;t
valuable. Po&s;|&s;ibly before this Time, you may have forgot both my Promi&s;e
and me, and it may not be extremely political to renew your Remem|brance of a
Per&s;on who has been &s;o long &s;eem|ingly neglectful. The Truth is, I can no
more bear to be forgot by tho&s;e I e&s;teem, than I <PB N="66" REF="75"> can
be cen&s;ured of Forgetfulne&s;s with Regard to them, and I know no Way but
Writing, by which I can evade both.</P>
<P>Some Sort of Apology I ought to make, that I did not write before;
you will there|fore plea&s;e to ob&s;erve, that I am but ju&s;t ar|rived at
Home, though I left <HI>Cheltenham</HI> the Day after you. I &s;tayed, indeed,
to hear Mr. B&mdash; preach a Morning Sermon; for which I find Mrs. C&mdash; 
has allotted him the Hat, pre|ferably to Mr. C&mdash;. Perhaps you may not
remember, nor did I hear till very lately, that there is a Hat given annually
at <HI>Cheltenham,</HI> for the U&s;e of the be&s;t foreign Preacher, of which
the Di&s;po&s;al is a&s;&s;igned to Mrs. C&mdash;, to her and her Heirs for
ever. I remember (tho' I knew nothing of this whil&s;t I was upon the Place) I
u&s;ed to be a little mi&s;deemful, that all who preached there had &s;ome
&s;uch Premium in their Eye. This Hat, 'tis true, is not quite &s;o valuable as
that of a <HI>Cardinal,</HI> but while it is made a Retribution for Ex|cellence
in &s;o (if properly con&s;idered) &s;ublime a Function, it is an Object for a
Preacher in any Degree. I am &s;orry, at the &s;ame Time, <PB N="67" REF="76">
to &s;ay, that as a <HI>common Hat,</HI> merely for its <HI>U&s;es,</HI> it
would be an Object to too many <HI>Coun|try Curates,</HI> who&s;e Situations
and &s;lender In|comes too often excite our Blu&s;hes, as well as
Compa&s;&s;ion. There &s;hould be no &s;uch Thing as a <HI>Journeyman
Par&s;on</HI>; it is beneath the Dignity of the Profe&s;&s;ion. If we had fewer
<HI>Pluralities</HI> in the Church, this Indecorum might, in a great Mea&s;ure,
be aboli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Mr. N&mdash; (<HI>Squire</HI> N&mdash;) I hear is fitting up his
Ca&s;tle at <HI>L&mdash;</HI> for the Reception of the little Widow; and the
Mercer at <HI>Cheltenham</HI> has completed his grand Arcade, for the better
Di&s;|po&s;ition of his Crapes and Callimancos.</P>
<P>I am an ill Relater of Matters of Fact, and as I &s;aid before, did
not continue above four and twenty Hours and &s;ome odd Minutes upon the Place
longer than you that enquire after it: but I &s;urvived long enough to hear
very frequent Mention of Mrs. A&mdash;, Mi&s;s CARTER, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and
&s;uch Mention, as has con|firmed me in an Opinion, that Per&s;ons of real

<P>PERHAPS you may remember to have &s;een an odd Kind of Fellow when
you were at <HI>Cheltenham,</HI> who threatened you with a Let|ter, and who is
now endeavouring to be as <HI>bad</HI> as his Word; however he hopes for &s;ome
lit|tle <PB N="69" REF="78"> Partiality on his Behalf, having delayed the
Execution of his Menaces for a con&s;ider|able Time, and even now promi&s;ing
to &s;ay as few Things in your Favour as the real Sen|timents of his Heart will
admit of.</P>
<P>But Peace to Buffoonery.&mdash;After I part|ed from you, Mr.
M&mdash;N, with great Simplicity, endeavoured to keep up my Spirits, by
&s;peak|ing in Prai&s;e of the Family we had left, as though that was not the
ready Method to aggravate the Sen&s;e of one's Lo&s;s; and yet to aggravate it
was utterly impo&s;&s;ible in the Opi|nion of a Per&s;on already &s;o
&s;en&s;ible of it. But he mentioned one Article which was more
&s;uc|ce&s;sful, and that was a Propo&s;al to accom|pany me to <HI>Stoke,</HI>
and to let me know when it &s;uited his Convenience.</P>
<P>When I came to <HI>Cheltenham,</HI> I was not un|mindful of that
&s;olemn Vow that I had made, not to &s;urvive your Family there a &s;ingle
Hour: but I found it near five o'Clock, and my Con|&s;cience &s;aid, that as I
had made it &s;o late, by my Attendance upon you, though I did &s;tay another
Night, I hoped I might be excu&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="79">I have been, &s;ince leaving this Town, at Mr.
BROWN's, who lives upon the Borders of <HI>Wales.</HI>&mdash;Poor Man! He has
been the mo&s;t obliging Per&s;on in the World to the mo&s;t &s;tu|pid of
Companions. 'Tis hardly po&s;&s;ible to determine which was greater, the Zeal
with which he &s;hewed me his Fo&s;&s;ils, Plants, Poe|try, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or
the &s;tupid Inattention with which I ob&s;erved them. He commends you and Mrs.
AUBREY highly; &s;o, indeed, do all I know, or I would &s;oon forget that I had
ever &s;een their Faces. He had found out a Method at la&s;t of &s;educing me
to talk, by frequent Men|tion of your Merits, and it was a good While before I
di&s;covered his Artifice; and even when I had di&s;covered it, I was ill able
to elude the Force of it.</P>
<P>I am now ju&s;t returned Home, which is my Apology for not writing
to you about <HI>Chel|tenham</HI> as I promi&s;ed. I really &s;carce recollect
any Circum&s;tance belonging to it, except that you and Mrs. AUBREY were there
the mo&s;t fa|vourable, agreeable, and prai&s;e-worthy.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="80">What, does Mr. M&mdash; boa&s;t of the glorious
Ab&s;urdity he committed at parting, in mi&s;|taking my Hor&s;e for his? When I
&s;ee him next, I will produce a Hundred I have been lately guilty of, to no
one of which his is able to compare. His, you know, commenced in the very
Moment of parting, and con&s;equent|ly was little wonderful, in Compari&s;on of
tho&s;e I have &s;ince committed; be&s;ides, his Hor&s;e had a Spot or two of
Brown on him, and was therefore ea&s;ily mi&s;taken at &s;uch a Time for one
that was Sorrel all over.</P>
<P>After all, you are a very wicked Lady&mdash;you defrauded me of the
Cro&s;let you promi&s;ed me, putting me off with a &s;ingle Bead; but it was
yours, and that's enough. The mo&s;t trivial Donation from a Per&s;on we
e&s;teem, has a large Value. I acknowledge to have a great <HI>Penchant</HI>
for what the Vulgar call <HI>Keep-Sakes.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> are notably

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS &s;ome Time &s;ince at Mr. WHISTLER's Chamber, when he
received a Letter from you, the Sight of which revived in my Mind the
plea&s;ing Corre&s;pondence you once favour|ed me with; the Lo&s;s of which I
much re|gret.&mdash;Do you never think of returning to <HI>Oxford?</HI> Have
you left nothing there that may give us Leave once more to expect you? I won't
be &s;o poetically complai&s;ant, as to &s;ay every Thing appears grieved at
your Ab|&s;ence, but I a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, there are &s;ome that &s;eem
&s;incerely to lament it. I can't com|pare tho&s;e little People that have
&s;ometimes <PB N="73" REF="82"> cen&s;ured you, to any Thing but Ants, who are
generally mo&s;t trouble&s;ome in the fine&s;t Sea&s;on. I can't hope, that
even a &s;hort Stay at <HI>C&mdash;</HI> could be made agreeable, but Novel|ty
is &s;ometimes plea&s;ing; de&s;cend then, and &s;ee the new Acquaintance I
have made, which is like to prove a very la&s;ting one: may yours be no le&s;s
&s;o!&mdash;Mr. GRAVES is in <HI>Glouce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> and Mr. WHISTLER,
God knows where, and you unkindly conceal from me the Place of your
Re&s;idence. I &s;hall direct this wandering Epi&s;|tle as u&s;ual, but
imagine, if it is &s;o fortunate as to find you, it will be in your Hermitage,
where I pre&s;ume you are before this retired. Were I Mr. WHISTLER, with what
Plea&s;ure &s;hould I leave the World, and all its Vanities, for Mr. SHENSTONE
and a Cell&mdash;Though I mu&s;t own, your Intention of making Mr. L&mdash;N
im|mortal, by a Dedication, and &s;inging the Prai&s;es and Virtues of the

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I CAN omit no Opportunity of &s;hewing my De&s;ire of continuing a
Corre&s;pondence that has always given me &s;o much Plea&s;ure. I wrote you a
Letter &s;ome Time ago, and &s;hould have u&s;ed &s;o little Ceremony, as to
have troubled you with another, had I known in what Part of the World you was.
If you know any Thing of Mr. G&mdash;, I &s;hould be glad to hear &s;omething
of him; I am informed that he is a Curate in &s;ome Village very
remote&mdash;It is a great Pity, &s;o much Merit &s;hould be no better
rewarded. We have been returned from <HI>London</HI> about three Weeks: if I
had known you were in Town, I &s;hould have left it with much more Reluctance.
If you come into <HI>Oxford&s;hire</HI> this Summer, I hope you will fa|vour me
with a Vi&s;it at <HI>C&mdash;,</HI> which will be a very great Plea&s;ure to
us all.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="84">You cannot imagine how happy you have made me,
in giving me Hopes of enjoying a Sight of your Poems; from which I am &s;ure of
reaping a Plea&s;ure which can admit of no Addition, but by receiving them from
your own Hands. I am glad to hear that Mr. G&mdash; is &s;ettled &s;o much to
his Satisfaction: if he is at <HI>All Souls,</HI> I hope I &s;hall &s;ee him
be|fore he leaves <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>I have lately lo&s;t a very agreeable Relation and &s;incere Friend.
Perhaps you have heard Mr. WHISTLER mention Mi&s;s B&mdash;: &s;he died at
<HI>C&mdash;</HI> about three Months &s;ince, after a &s;hort Illne&s;s of two
Days; which added &s;o much to the melancholy Situation here, that we were
obliged to fly to Town for Amu&s;e|ments. I came down ten Days &s;ince, and
&s;hall return again to-morrow, for about a Week longer. May I hope, dear Sir,
to find a Let|ter here from you? I am &s;ure the reading of it will give me
more real Plea&s;ure than any Company or Diver&s;ion I can propo&s;e to find in
<HI>London.</HI> I am &s;orry to &s;end you any News that will give you
Concern; but can't help <PB N="76" REF="85"> telling you, that I hear poor Mr.
R. G&mdash; is dangerou&s;ly ill of a Fever in Town. Mr. WHISTLER has left
<HI>Oxford,</HI> on Account of the Small-Pox, which is very much there, and at
pre&s;ent in <HI>Pembroke</HI> College.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this un&s;ea&s;onable Weather, I mu&s;t beg leave
to put you in Mind of your Promi&s;e, and enquire when it is you de&s;ign us
the Plea&s;ure of your Company in <HI>Oxford|&s;hire</HI>; where you will meet
with a great many who will rejoice much to &s;ee you, and none more than
your</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I MAKE no Doubt, but you will be much &s;urpri&s;ed at the Receipt
of this, and like wi&s;e greatly concerned at the melancholy Oc|ca&s;ion of it.
As the Friend&s;hip &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between you and my Brother has been of
&s;o long &s;tanding, I &s;hould be glad to communi|cate its Contents to you
more gently by &s;ome other Hand; but for Want of a Friend in your
Neighbourhood, who has the Honour of your Acquaintance, mu&s;t do it my&s;elf
in the lea&s;t affecting Manner I am capable.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="91">The Beginning of this Month, my Brother was
taken ill of a &s;ore Throat, which con|tinued for &s;ome Days, without any
apparent Symptoms of Danger; indeed, towards the la&s;t it was judged the
Di&s;order was throwing it|&s;elf off: but to the great Surpri&s;e of every
one, a Mortification in his In&s;ide was then be|gun, and came on &s;o fa&s;t,
that it was out of the Power of Art, to &s;top it, of which he ex|pired the
10th. In <HI>April,</HI> I had the Plea&s;ure of his Company at
<HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> for a few Days, with my Father, when among&s;t other
agreeable Schemes for this Summer's Amu&s;ement, he propo&s;ed to him&s;elf
very great Plea&s;ure, from paying Mr. SHENSTONE a Vi&s;it&mdash;But Man
propo&s;es and God di&s;po&s;es. I have lo&s;t a very good kind Brother;
therefore hope tho&s;e who were his Friends will continue their Friend&s;hip to
me for his Sake, which I &s;hall always endeavour to de&s;erve. To give you
this melancholy In|formation is a painful Duty; but it is what I am compelled
to pay. I can, in &s;ome Mea|&s;ure, conceive the many afflicting Recollections
which will ari&s;e in your humane Mind, on this Event! Your Friend&s;hip and
Corre&s;pondence <PB N="83" REF="92"> &s;ub&s;i&s;ted a con&s;iderable Time,
and with recipro|cal Satisfaction. He was unque&s;tionably en|dowed with
natural good Sen&s;e, well improved by Education and Reading, of a lively
plea|&s;ing Fancy, and a benevolent Heart. He was, in &s;hort, what your Pen
might mo&s;t exqui&s;itely de&s;cribe, but what mine is unequal to.</P>
<P>I beg your Acceptance of a Ring, in Re|membrance of him, which
&s;hall be conveyed to <HI>Birmingham</HI> the fir&s;t Opportunity. My Fa|ther

<P>I Should with Plea&s;ure have obeyed your kind Command, and troubled
you with a Let|ter before this, but that I waited to give you &s;ome Account of
your Friends here. I &s;aw Mr. DODSLEY &s;oon after I came to Town; he &s;eems

Ana|tomi&s;ts, (for &s;uch I pre&s;ume they were) and Pen, Ink, and a Ream of
Paper before them; had I been free enough with your Friend, I &s;hould
certainly have enquired, what weighty Di&s;coveries they had been engaged in,

left <HI>T&ecirc;te-&agrave;-T&ecirc;te</HI> with <PB N="85" REF="94"> Mr.
W&mdash;, and then Subjects of &s;till greater Importance, &s;uch as Plays,
Operas, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> were to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. Without a
Compliment, I think our Friend improves upon Acquain|tance much; but I wi&s;h
him, as you tell him, le&s;s volatile: to &s;ay the Truth, when you brought him
to <HI>W&mdash;</HI> with K&mdash;, he was &s;o very alert, that I was not (but
that he came with you) much prejudiced in his Favour; however, I find he has
more Merit than tho&s;e over-lively young Gentlemen gene|rally have; and I
doubt not, but when you have pruned the Luxuriancy of his Sprightli|ne&s;s, he
will make a very good Figure.</P>
<P>I am &s;incerely &s;orry, my Congratulations on your having a Place

Friend GRIFFITH terms it, <HI>Polaury,</HI> though I know it could not have the
Effect on you, it &s;o evidently has had on &mdash;: but what any one could
think due to CIBBER's Merit, Mr. SHENSTONE ought to think beneath him.</P>
<P>I have not the Book you enquired for in yours, nor any one that I
can recollect, from <PB N="86" REF="95"> you. The Letters you were &s;o good as
to &s;end me, are &s;afe locked up in my Bureau, and &s;hall be returned when
we meet; I took the Liberty of keeping them, as I had no Opportunity of

you have any Com|mands here, I hope you will oblige me with them, and when you
are at Lei&s;ure, let me hear from you: but DODSLEY tells me, you are
re-peru&s;ing your Elegies, (he hopes for the Pre&s;s) and I would not
interrupt you from &s;uch Engagements for the World, as you have too long
deprived the Learned and Ta&s;teful the Plea&s;ure of admiring them.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVIII. A. B&mdash;, E&s;q. to W. SHENSTONE, E&s;q.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Mr. SHENSTONE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU make me very happy, by the kind Turn you give to the
unfa&s;hionable Re|&s;erve I told you in my la&s;t I labour under. I am
&s;incerely de&s;irous of being dear to you; and if the 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>eadem velle atque eadem nolle</HI>"</Q> is a
good Omen of a la&s;ting Friend&s;hip, I have good Rea&s;ons to hope, that the
Names of W. SHENSTONE and A. B&mdash; will ever be mu|tually e&s;teemed by each
other; for without meaning a Compliment, but to my own Judg|ment, I really
think, to know what you like or di&s;like, &s;ome <HI>few</HI> Per&s;ons
excepted, is &s;uf|ficient to make me do the &s;ame: but I beg for the future,
when you mention the Valua|bles <HI>London</HI> robs the Country of, at this
Sea|&s;on, you will not immediately add, that Lord P&mdash; is ju&s;t &s;et out
from <HI>N&mdash;</HI> on his Way here.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="103"><HI>A-propos!</HI> You tell me you are bu&s;y
in re|gulating your Library; will not you laugh at me, if I draw a
Compari&s;on, and tell you that I am engaged at pre&s;ent in a &s;imilar
Affair? Regulating the Friends I henceforward de&s;ign admitting into my
Heart's inmo&s;t Rece&s;s. You, I dare &s;ay, even in <HI>your</HI> Library
have admit|ted &s;ome Rubbi&s;h, you will now throw out; how much then mu&s;t
I, who from a very Child have been a Kind of Enthu&s;ia&s;t in Friend&s;hip,
have to clean&s;e from my E&s;teem? Indeed, I find upon Examination, I have
been much out in my Collection, and have ranked many <HI>fuga|cious
Pamphlets,</HI> as JOHNSON calls them, as Fir&s;t|rate Authors; but I &s;hall
make a total Rum|mage, and hope, for the future, my Ta&s;te will be more
refined; indeed, I do not fear it, for I have cho&s;en your Wor&s;hip &s;ole
Librarian of the Place; and to &s;ay the Truth, I find you &s;o delicate a
Gentleman, that you have routed every other living Soul, (my own
<HI>neare&s;t</HI> Relations excepted) nor can I find that you will admit any
one el&s;e to enter the poor Cell you have the Charge of but Lord D&mdash;:
well, well, you are quite right; I &s;hall have enough <PB N="95" REF="104"> to
do to value you two as I ought; you <HI>two</HI> &s;hall be my Study, and if I
don't improve enough from reading you, it will be my Fault: for the Pamphlets,
I &s;hall dip into them oc|ca&s;ionally, at an idle Hour, unle&s;s a female one
demands my clo&s;er Application; but I promi&s;e you, I &s;hall be very
cautious in my Choice of her.</P>
<P>I am much obliged to you, for offering to introduce me to the
Acquaintance of Dr. G&mdash;. I &s;hould eagerly lay hold of the Favour, but
that I purpo&s;e leaving <HI>London</HI> on <HI>Monday</HI> the 26th of this
Month, and &s;hall not have Time to pay him the Attention I owe every Friend of
Mr. SHENSTONE's.</P>
<P>I have from your Recommendation read the Hi&s;tory of <HI>La
Pompadour,</HI> and like it very well; it &s;eems authentic, though not much to
the Honour of the <HI>Dame</HI> or <HI>Louis le Grand.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall expect two Letters from your Wor|&s;hip, in an&s;wer to my
la&s;t Non&s;en&s;e and <HI>this,</HI> and pray, good Sir, do be not &s;o very
conci&s;e. Mr. SHENSTONE, believe me, is wor&s;e Com|pany <PB N="96" REF="105">
than any Man, when <HI>he</HI> is &s;ilent; mo&s;t People know how agreeable
every Word he &s;ays is, and when he is plea&s;ed to be mute, cannot but be
unea&s;y. According to this, you'll &s;ay, your Friend wi&s;hes you to kill
your&s;elf with talking; not &s;o&mdash;but he refers the Whole to your better
Judgment, who knows be&s;t (when your mode&s;t Humility does not too much
in|terfere) how to do every Thing with the be&s;t Grace.</P>
<P>If you have by you your <HI>Ode on Autumn,</HI> or <HI>Damon's
Bower,</HI> and care to tru&s;t them by the Bearer, you will do me a great
Favour in &s;ending them. If you can venture out of your agreeable
<HI>Shell</HI> at the <HI>Lea&s;owes,</HI> and (provided you are preparing your
Elegies for the Pre&s;s) will bring them with you, not letting the Fa|vour you
do us delay the Plea&s;ure you will give the polite World in publi&s;hing them,
we &s;hall think our&s;elves happy in accommodating you with a warm Room, Pen,
Ink and Paper, in this Part of the World.</P>
<P>I return the Duche&s;s of SOMERSET's Letters, which I have peru&s;ed

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM &s;orry I hurried my E&s;&s;ay out of your Hands, before you
had done with it; but if I think of publi&s;hing my Fables next
<HI>Oc|tober</HI> or <HI>November,</HI> it is high Time I &s;hould put both to
Pre&s;s now, that the Printer may have good Weather to print in, and that the
Work may have Time to dry, after it is fini&s;h|ed, before the Books are bound.
But as it <PB N="104" REF="113"> happens, I cannot begin till the latter End of
this Month, as the Printer is not at Lei&s;ure; however, I have put my Plates
in Hand, and they are going on as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible. I never received Mr.
ALCOCK's Drawings; &s;o I have got two others executed, of &s;omewhat a
dif|ferent De&s;ign. I will not put the E&s;&s;ay in Hand till the la&s;t,
which may, perhaps, be about <HI>July,</HI> as I &s;hall be very de&s;irous of
its having the Advantage of your Corrections. But am I not to hope for a new
Fable or two from you? You &s;ee how I dwindle in my Expectations: but pray
don't let me be <HI>quite</HI> di&s;appointed. I propo&s;e, if po&s;&s;ible, to
fini&s;h the Printing of my Fables before I &s;et out on my northern

another mu&s;t be &s;pent at Lord LYTTELTON's, (as they are both ac|quainted

&s;uppo&s;e he makes no Secret of it. I wi&s;h Mr. GRAVES would fini&s;h

<P>I WAS ye&s;terday &s;earching for Figures for your two

Size, <HI>viz.</HI> the ANTINOUS I mentioned, and the APOLLO with his Arm over
his Head; a FLORA and a CERES; and a HOMER and VIRGIL. The ANTINOUS and APOLLO
are two Feet high, FLORA and CERES twenty-three Inches, and HOMER and VIRGIL
twenty-one. The&s;e la&s;t are each of them leaning upon a Pede&s;tal; on one
of which, in <HI>Ba&s;&s;o Relievo,</HI> is <HI>Troy</HI> in Flames; on the
other, ROMULUS and REMUS &s;ucking a Wolf. The&s;e are both pretty Fi|gures;
and don't you think them better Or|naments for a Library, and more &s;uitable
Com|panions for SAPPHO, than either of the others? A Line by the Return of the

I &s;hall have a Picture of Mr. SHENSTONE; you will have one only of DODSLEY;

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. SHENSTONE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HOW much am I obliged to you for the Pains you have taken in
tran&s;lating LA MOTTE's Di&s;cour&s;e on Fable! and though I fancy you will
find, upon comparing the two, that I have made a good Deal of U&s;e of it, I
&s;hall be very glad to have more of it in|terwoven, if you &s;hall think I
have not &s;uffi|ciently extracted the E&s;&s;ence of it. I mu&s;t mu&s;t own,
my Pride (or call it my Folly, if you plea&s;e) would rather choo&s;e to prefix
&s;ome|what of my own on that Subject, than &s;ervilely adopt the Thoughts of a
<HI>Frenchman,</HI> though I acknowledge them to be very ingenious. Be|&s;ides,
I have had the Hardine&s;s to differ with him in &s;ome Re&s;pects, which makes
it &s;till more improper to take his whole Di&s;cour&s;e. Proceed, therefore,
if you plea&s;e, in correcting my E&s;&s;ay; and interweave with it as much 
<PB N="110" REF="119"> more of LA MOTTE as you may think pro|per. If you defer
this till I come down, which I wi&s;h you would not, pray in the mean Time
think of half a Dozen new Fables, that we may not have too much to embarra&s;s
us when together. My Face is quite fini&s;hed, and I believe very like. I fancy
I &s;hall &s;end it, together with the Figures, on <HI>Monday</HI> Se'en|night;
but I &s;hall not be able to &s;et out my&s;elf till <HI>Monday</HI> Fortnight,
and &s;taying a Week or ten Days at <HI>Nottingham</HI> and <HI>Mansfield,</HI>
will detain me from the <HI>Lea&s;owes</HI> till the latter End of next Month.
If the Picture &s;hould be turned yellowi&s;h, by being packed up, Mr. REYNOLDS
advi&s;es, that it be &s;et in the Sun for two Hours, which will quite recover
it. Why did you leave the Choice of your two Figures to me? How could you put
me un|der &s;uch a Difficulty? If I have done wrong, you will &s;uffer for it;
and &s;ay what you will, I have not &s;ufficient Firmne&s;s of Ta&s;te to
di|rect me right; be&s;ides, I do not exactly re|member the Niches: it is
therefore your Fault to tru&s;t me; and if I have erred, your Duty to forgive
me. I have ordered the HOMER and VIRGIL to be bronzed: they are very pretty 
<PB N="111" REF="120"> Figures; and if you have, as you &s;ay, no other
Objection to them, but the Want of two or three Inches more of Height, I hope
&s;ome Means may be found to obviate &s;o &s;mall a Deficiency. I &s;hould not,
however, have ven|tured to &s;end them, but that you &s;eemed, at la&s;t, to
acquie&s;ce in their being &s;ent. I think, however, I have been &s;omewhat
happy in my Urns; and I am not without Hopes, that you will approve the whole
Cargo. The Folio-VIRGIL will come in the &s;ame Package. I feel my&s;elf very
happy in the Thoughts of &s;eeing you &s;oon, and will ha&s;ten the Day as much
as is in my Power. I hope Mr. BAS|KERVILLE will be quite ready for me; I
&s;hall &s;end him the Paper in a Fortnight. I am</P>

very &s;orry I had pretended to meddle with his Ode, and begged 
<PB N="114" REF="123"> his Pardon. He is &s;till unappea&s;ed, writes me
another angry Letter, and de&s;ires me to give him my Rea&s;ons for every
Alteration; this it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to do, as I have forgot how it
originally was; and I really think it of very little Con&s;equence, as no Name
ap|pears to it.</P>
<P>Mr. STUART is ju&s;t now with me, and de|&s;ires his Compliments. He
thinks of &s;eeing your Place the latter End of the Summer, and believes the
Attorney-General, Mr. PRATT, will be with him. I have ju&s;t been &s;truck with

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVI. W. SHENSTONE, E&s;q. to Mr. HULL, at
<HI>Birmingham.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I DESIRE my Compliments to Mr. HULL and Mi&s;s MORRISON, with many
Thanks for the Plea&s;ure I received from la&s;t Night's Play.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A ha&s;ty and imperfect Compilation of &s;ome Scenes, on the
Subject of ROSAMOND, which, however, laid the Ground-Work of the pre&s;ent
Tragedy, acted at <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> Theatre. The Public may ea&s;ily
di&s;cern how fully the Author has availed him&s;elf of the kind and judicious
Hints contained in the Letter before us.</NOTE> It was, indeed, acted with
great Spirit, and as far as I could judge, afforded the Au|dience no &s;mall
Satisfaction&mdash;not, perhaps, equal to what they derived from the Appearance
of the Dun Cow, <HI>&amp;c.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Introduced in a
Pantomime performed the &s;ame Even|ing.</NOTE> for that is hardly to be
expected.</P>
<P>I think the Play has now &s;o much <HI>good</HI> in it, that it may
be worth Mr. HULL's while <PB N="116" REF="125"> to give it a few more
fini&s;hing Touches. Sup|po&s;e a Confe&s;&s;or or Friar, either out of Ha|tred
to the Queen, view to his own Advance|ment, or any <HI>&s;elfi&s;h</HI> Motive
(which he might explain in a &s;hort Soliloquy) per&s;uaded ROSA|MOND to
a&s;pire to the Throne, and to urge the King to a Divorce; that ROSAMOND
&s;hould avow her Abhorrence of &s;uch Inju&s;tice to the Queen, intimating,
that her Love had no other Object than the King's Per&s;on and heroic Vir|tues;
that this Refu&s;al &s;hould affront the Friar, who in Revenge &s;hould inform
the Queen, that ROSAMOND actually <HI>had</HI> tho&s;e very Intentions with
which he had been endeavouring to in|&s;pire her, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This would
throw more Plot into the Play, (which it wants) would more &s;ufficiently
account for the Queen's &s;udden Change from a mild Character to a revenge|ful
one, and, as Mr. HULL thinks the Play too &s;hort, would add two new Scenes.
Some further Improvements I would recommend in the Clo&s;e, and a few more
Places; but Mr. HULL's further <HI>Attention</HI> to the Play, will render it
need|le&s;s to point them out to him.</P>
<P>If you &s;hould ever complete this Undertak|ing to your Liking, and
produce the Piece <PB N="117" REF="126"> on a <HI>London</HI>-Stage, I would
recommend, that you &s;hould by all Means give it a double Title in the printed
Bills; namely, HENRY <HI>the Second, or the Fall of</HI> ROSAMOND.</P>
<P>I &s;hould e&s;teem it as a Favour, if Mr. HULL would &s;end me down
a Copy of the Prologue and Epilogue as they were &s;poken; which I will not
communicate without his Permi&s;&s;ion. Either his or Mi&s;s MORRISON's Mu&s;e
&s;eems to favour them at a Minute's Warning.</P>
<P>Mr. HODGETTS, with whom I am at pre|&s;ent, would be glad that Mr.
HULL would dine here, about two; and &s;o &s;hould I, if it be no way
inconvenient to him.</P>
<P>I had almo&s;t forgot to thank you for the Stanzas you left at the
<HI>Lea&s;owes,</HI> when I was on a Vi&s;it to <HI>Hagley.</HI> They are well
con|&s;tructed for the Occa&s;ion, and the Idea &s;eems to ari&s;e from humane
Sen&s;ibility, warmed with hone&s;t Indignation.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>The <HI>Lea&s;owes,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>Oct.</HI> 18, 1761.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. HULL,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF I recollect aright, both you and NED ALCOCK were here this la&s;t
Autumn, on the Evening when my Fi&s;h-Ponds had been robbed, and the Fi&s;h
de&s;troyed. You were an Eye-Witne&s;s of the Circum&s;tances, there|fore
cannot but retain them in your Memo|ry. I find I have been arraigned of
<HI>Lenity,</HI> by &s;everal con&s;cientiou&s;ly-upright Neighbours. 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>I have &s;creened a Robber from
Ju&s;tice</HI>;"&mdash;"<HI>I have given Encouragement to future Thefts,</HI>"
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> Such are the A&s;per&s;ions wherewith I have 
<PB N="121" REF="130"> been loaded. I make a material Di&s;tinction between a
<HI>Robber</HI> and a <HI>Pilferer</HI>; nor can I a&s;&s;ign the former
Appellation to a poor Wretch, who, in his Hunger, has taken two or three
<HI>Fi&s;hes,</HI> or as many <HI>Loaves.</HI> It is true, I would rather have
given more than the Value of them, to have prevented my <HI>finny Friends</HI>
being di|&s;turbed in, or taken away, from their elemen|tal Habitation; it is
al&s;o as true, that, in my fir&s;t Warmth, on the Report that the Fellow had
brui&s;ed the poor Creatures to Death again&s;t the Stumps and Roots of Trees,
I could not only have delivered him over to Ju&s;tice, but have been almo&s;t
induced to become my&s;elf his Puni&s;her; but when that Warmth &s;ubmitted to
cool Reflection, <HI>I felt it impo&s;&s;ible</HI> to re&s;i&s;t his Argument,
of having a Wife with five Children at Home, and not a Doit to procure them a
Meal. I verily believe too he &s;poke the Truth. Poverty and Affliction
&s;eemed to work and plead within him, and his Words were the Words of
Nature.</P>
<P>I cannot be &s;o &s;evere again&s;t the&s;e petty Mi&s;demeanours as
many are; nor can I, though I revere the Call of Ju&s;tice, be a rigorous 
<PB N="122" REF="131"> Supporter of its Claims, except in atrocious Ca&s;es.
Be&s;ide, what had it availed me, to have con&s;igned the Offender to the Power
of a Ma|gi&s;trate? Rather &s;ay, what Pain and Inconve|nience &s;hould I not
have entailed on my&s;elf? I &s;hould have had the Trouble of attending the
Examination; have had the Fellow impri|&s;oned many Days; and the additional
Mortifi|cation of travelling, perhaps to <HI>Warwick,</HI> or
<HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> in order to convict him. And after all, no Re&s;titution
is made for my Lo&s;s, though it were ten Times more valuable than a whole
<HI>Draught of Fi&s;hes.</HI> There is &s;urely &s;omething deficient in our
Laws, concerning the <HI>Meum &amp; Tuum</HI>; the Per&s;on robbed not only
abides the Lo&s;s without Amends, but is even put to Expence, as well as
Inconvenience, to get the Robber puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>Then again, the Wife and five Children!&mdash;The poor Fellow
&s;ub&s;i&s;ts, chief Part of the Year, only by carrying News-Papers round the
Country. Had He been &s;hut up, what was to have &s;upported the ragged Family
meanwhile? I am be&s;ide inclined to think, that half a Crown, and a little
whole&s;ome Admonition, <PB N="123" REF="132"> that is, if he be not a
practi&s;ed and &s;tubborn Offender, might go as far towards amending his
Morals, as an Acquaintance with the In|&s;ide of a Pri&s;on, and the
Conver&s;ation of &s;uch A&s;&s;ociates as he might find there.</P>
<P>I have &s;uffered my&s;elf &s;ometimes to doubt the Excellence of
our Laws, relative to Life and Death, notwith&s;tanding I know it has been
a&s;&s;erted by many People, that they are wi&s;er than tho&s;e of any other
Nation. What then? Is the Man who takes a few Guineas from you on the Highway,
on a Level with him who commits a deliberate Murder? And is there no
Puni&s;hment to be found more ade|quate to the fir&s;t Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion,
than taking away the Life? Surely, one Example made by a vi&s;ible Brand, a
Mark of Di&s;grace, which could never be wa&s;hed away, would more avail
towards the Prevention of future Crimes, than half the Executions in the
Kingdom, which have now, from two great Frequency, lo&s;t the chief Part of
their Purpo&s;e and Terror. The Puni&s;hment which was inflicted by a Regent in
&s;ome Part of the Ea&s;t, (I think the Circum|&s;tance is related in the
<HI>Arabian Nights Enter|tainments)</HI> <PB N="124" REF="133"> on a Judge who
had been induced, by Gold, to give an unju&s;t Deci&s;ion, is admi|rable. The
Brand, placed on his Habitation, in legible Characters, 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Here lives a corrupt Judge,</HI>"</Q> was, in
the highe&s;t Degree, con&s;o|nant to Ju&s;tice, ina&s;much as it made the
Crime its own Puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>I have been led into the&s;e Reflections by finding how &s;everely I
have been arraigned, only for having been <HI>an innocent Defrauder of the
Law</HI>: &s;o have troubled you with them; but here I come to a Conclu&s;ion.
You are at Liberty to draw what Inferences you plea&s;e from, or make what
Objections you like to, my Opinion.</P>
<P>I am now to thank you for the Anecdotes you have given me, as well
as for the Peru|&s;al of the enclo&s;ed Ballad. I am particularly plea&s;ed

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. HULL,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I ESTEEM my&s;elf beholden to you, for having made me acquainted
with the Rea|lity of the two Writers, Dr. LANCASTER and HENRY. I have admired
them both in their Pages, but knew only their Names. In fact, when I fir&s;t
read the <HI>E&s;&s;ay on Delicacy,</HI> I ima|gined the Name of LANCASTER to
be ficti|tious, and that the Work might be the Pro|duction of the Author of
<HI>Sir Thomas Fitz-O&s;horne's Letters.</HI> There is great Spirit, fine
Sentiment, and true Elegance of Style through|out; and my Friend DODSLEY's
pre&s;erving it in his <HI>Fugitive Pieces</HI> is truly meritorious. It well
de&s;erves to be re&s;cued from Oblivion. But what a Pity that your Uncle does

in &s;uch Writers. <PB N="133" REF="142"> How much likewi&s;e is it to be
lamented, that a Man of &s;uch Abilities &s;hould lie concealed in an ob&s;cure

is, I mean, for the Sake of the World; to his own Happi|ne&s;s, probably,
Retirement was mo&s;t condu|cive. It is mo&s;t certain, that no Men are fit for
Solitude, but tho&s;e who find the Source of Amu&s;ement and Employment in
them&s;elves. Fancy, Reflection, and a Love of Reading, are indi&s;pen&s;ably
nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uch a Situation. It is downright Lunacy for a Man who has
pa&s;|&s;ed his Life in a Compting-Hou&s;e, or a Shop; who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es,
po&s;&s;ibly, but a moderate Share of natural Under&s;tanding, that
Under&s;tanding too not cultivated by Education, and who has ne|ver known what
it is was to look into a Book&mdash;It is, I repeat, downright Lunacy, for
&s;uch a Man to think of <HI>retiring.</HI> He knows not, the Fatigue he is
going to encounter: he will want Employment for his Hours; mo&s;t pro|bably,
may &s;horten his Exi&s;tence, and while he retains it, it will be one
continued State of Apathy, if not Di&s;order.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM greatly obliged both to you and Mi&s;s MORRISON, for the
Ballads you were &s;o good as to inclo&s;e to me. The Speed you have u&s;ed in
&s;ending them, te&s;tifies the Rea|lity of that Delight you &s;eemed to
expre&s;s at the <HI>Lea&s;owes,</HI> when I fir&s;t communicated my Friend Dr.
PERCY's De&s;ign. I &s;ent them di|rectly <PB N="136" REF="145"> to him; he has
begun to print off his venerable Collection,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Antient Poetry,</HI> now publi&s;hed in three Volumes; the
univer&s;al E&s;timation and Encouragement of which Work, &s;ufficiently
te&s;tifies its Excellence.</NOTE> with an Eye to the Publication of it
&s;ometime next Winter. One of your Ballads is truly beautily and extreme|ly
proper for his Purpo&s;e. It has that <HI>Nai|vet&eacute;,</HI> which is &s;o
very e&s;&s;ential in Ballads of all Kind; and which requires no more than,
that <HI>&s;ublime,</HI> or <HI>elegant,</HI> or <HI>tender</HI> Sentiments be
expre&s;&s;ed in a &s;imple and unaffected Manner&mdash;<HI>Sentimental</HI>
Language would be no ill Term for it; or, perhaps, the E&s;&s;ay before
DODSLEY's <HI>Fables</HI> does not improperly &s;tile it, the <HI>Voice</HI> of
Sentiment, in Oppo&s;ition to the <HI>Language</HI> of Reflection.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>other,</HI> Mi&s;s M&mdash; well di|&s;tingui&s;hes,
that the Merit of it is almo&s;t wholly confined to the Sentiment at la&s;t.
This is both <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>tender</HI>; and would <HI>&s;he</HI>
take the Pains to new-write the <HI>whole</HI> on this Ac|count, (for even this
Sentiment is not <HI>expre&s;&s;ed</HI> &s;o very &s;imply as one could wi&s;h
it) I dare &s;ay it is in her Power to render it very plea|&s;ing. 
<PB N="137" REF="146"> I know not how far I am <HI>&s;ingular</HI>; but as I
love to avail my&s;elf of different Words, to bundle up Ideas in different
Parcels, it is become habitual to me, to call <HI>that</HI> a <HI>Ballad</HI>
which de&s;cribes or implies &s;ome <HI>Action</HI>; on the other Hand, I term
that a <HI>Song,</HI> which contains only an Expre&s;&s;ion of
<HI>Sentiment.</HI> Ac|cording to this Account, I believe one of your Pieces
would appear a <HI>Ballad,</HI> and the other a <HI>Song.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Play-Hou&s;e</HI> Coronations an&s;wer the Pur|po&s;e of all
tho&s;e who chu&s;e to compound the Matter betwixt <HI>Indolence</HI> and
<HI>Curio&s;ity.</HI> Mr. GARRICK has given a very genteel Turn to this Ta&s;te
among the Citizens, in his Epilogue to the new Play.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Epilogue to the Tragedy of <HI>Hecuba,</HI> produced that Year at
<HI>Drury-Lane</HI> Theatre.</NOTE> I have not <HI>yet</HI> &s;een this

Appearance on the Stage. Why does not <HI>your</HI> Dr. LANCAS|TER

his <HI>E&s;&s;ay upon Delicacy?</HI> I read it, &s;ince I wrote la&s;t, in

it mighty well de&s;erves the Labour nece&s;&s;ary to its Continuation.</P>
<P>'Tis true, that Specimens of Wit or Hu|mour have been di&s;pen&s;ed
this Winter but &s;pa|ringly from the Pre&s;s; and even there in
<HI>po|litical</HI> Pamphlets, where I am lea&s;t inclined to &s;eek them. But
we mu&s;t &s;wim with the Tide, if we would collect the Shells and Co|rals that
it leaves behind; accordingly I have read two or three of the&s;e Pamphlets
which have an&s;wered my Expectations. Should any other appear that &s;trikes

<OPENER><DATELINE>The <HI>Lea&s;owes,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>Dec.</HI> 8, 1761.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mi&s;s M&mdash;,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I OUGHT to have returned Thanks for your agreeable Account of the
Excur&s;ion to <HI>Chep&s;tow,</HI> &s;ome Time ago; but the&s;e are Du|ties
which I do not always perform &s;o &s;oon as I ought&mdash;you know I
don't&mdash;Neither will I wa&s;te my Time and Paper in apologizing for a
Failing which you are &s;o ready to forgive, <PB N="144" REF="153"> convinced
that I am not le&s;s grateful on that Account.</P>
<P>I have great Joy in reading the&s;e little plea&s;urable Travels, in
a private Letter, related, as yours are, without Formality, de&s;cribing, with
Ea&s;e and Simplicity, every little Occur|rence as it falls out. I can journey
with you in Imagination, and partake every trivial Dif|ficulty and every
Delight. <HI>You</HI> are fond of the&s;e little <HI>Parties of
Plea&s;ure,</HI> as they are called, and in you it is, by no Means, reprovable;
but in general, they are very dangerous to young Folks. <HI>You</HI> have Means
and Time, at your own Di&s;po&s;al; your Party is &s;mall and &s;elect, both in
Point of Reputation and Un|der&s;tanding; you likewi&s;e turn your Excur|&s;ion
to &s;ome Advantage; you make Ob&s;erva|tions on all you &s;ee, form nice
Di&s;tinctions between different Places, Points, and Charac|ters, and draw
ju&s;t Conclu&s;ions from them&mdash;But, as I &s;aid before, the&s;e Parties
too often are hazardous; the Mind once indulged in them, is apt to covet them
too often; they are &s;ometimes the Means of drawing a Female into improper
Company; they encroach on <PB N="145" REF="154"> Means and Time, neither of
which, probably, can with Propriety be be&s;towed; they have their Source in
Di&s;&s;ipation, are continually at|tended with Hazard, and too often end in
the Wor&s;t of Mi&s;chiefs. In &s;hort, I would wi&s;h all young Folks, who
have neither Lei&s;ure nor Money at Command, to &s;hut their Ears again&s;t the
very Name of <HI>a Party of Plea&s;ure.</HI></P>
<P>More than once in my Life, I have been &s;o|licited by Friends to
vi&s;it foreign Climes. I had an Invitation of this Kind lately; but it is now
too late; at lea&s;t, I think &s;o&mdash;Be&s;ides, why &s;hould a Man go &s;o
far for Objects of Cu|rio&s;ity, who has &s;een too little of his own Coun|try?
Many Parts of <HI>England, Wales</HI> and <HI>Scot|land</HI> equally (I
&s;hould think) de&s;erve our Ad|miration, and we need not ri&s;que Winds and
Waves, to which I feel <HI>&s;ome</HI> Objection. Num|bers of our travelling
Gentry peregrinate too early in Life, before the Mind is &s;ufficiently formed
to make proper Ob&s;ervations on what they &s;ee and hear.</P>
<P>A Friend once related an Anecdote, which is appo&s;ite to my
Subject. A very young <PB N="146" REF="155"> Man, of good natural
Under&s;tanding, and Heir to an affluent Fortune, would needs be one of the&s;e
incon&s;iderate Travellers. In the Cour&s;e of his Adventures, he fell into
Company, in <HI>Naples,</HI> with &s;ome well-travelled, and well-in|formed
Foreigners. They were conver&s;ing on what they had &s;een in <HI>England</HI>;
and &s;ome little Difference in Opinion ari&s;ing about the Ar|chitecture of
<HI>Wind&s;or</HI>-Ca&s;tle, they naturally re|ferred them&s;elves to the young
<HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> for Deci&s;ion. With much Confu&s;ion and He&s;ita|tion
he was compelled to confe&s;s, he had ne|ver &s;een the Building in Que&s;tion.
The Com|pany, with true foreign Politene&s;s, only te&s;ti|fied their
Admiration in a &s;ilent Smile&mdash;but the Reflection in&s;tantly &s;truck,
and pained the young Gentleman. The Re&s;ult was, that he returned for
<HI>England</HI> within two Days, rational|ly determined to in&s;truct
him&s;elf in the Know|ledge of his own Country, before he pryed in|to tho&s;e
afar off. His Reflection and Deter|mination did equal Credit to his
Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Our Friend HULL has, as u&s;ual, been amu|&s;ing us with as good a
Drama, as our neigh|bouring Town can give Encouragement to; 
<PB N="147" REF="156"> but &s;ays, he returns no more. I know many who will be
&s;orry on this Account. He has not departed, however, without having excited
Curio&s;ity in a very peculiar Way; on a &s;mall Plan, indeed, but to a very
commenda|ble Purpo&s;e. He enticed with him his two principal Actre&s;&s;es,
Mi&s;s MORRISON and Mi&s;s IBBOT, (both po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great Merit in
their Profe&s;&s;ion) &s;ome few of his Band, two Voices, and gave an Evening's
Entertainment of <HI>Sing|ing</HI> and <HI>Reading,</HI> at the little Town of
<HI>Stour|bridge,</HI> &s;ome few Miles off; the Profits de|voted to the
A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a Trade&s;man, who had &s;uffered under repeated
Misfortunes. The Succe&s;s, I hear, more than an&s;wered his Ex|pectations; the
little A&s;&s;embly-Room was croud|ed, and with much good Company. A &s;light
Cold made me fearful of being out late, but the Particulars were given me by a
neigh|bouring Clergyman who was pre&s;ent. The Pieces &s;elected for Reading
were well-cho&s;en. I do not remember the whole Number, but I recollect that
<HI>Mi&s;s</HI> CARTER<HI>'s Ode to Wi&s;dom,</HI> PRIOR<HI>'s Henry and
Emma,</HI> and GRAY's <HI>Elegy in a Country Church-Yard</HI> were among&s;t
them. The latter gave particular Satisfaction, my <PB N="148" REF="157"> Friend
told me, to the Gentlemen of the Pul|pit, of whom he counted &s;even. The whole
was received with great Approbation. You are to ob&s;erve that HULL and his
Party, &s;o far from propo&s;ing any Emolument to them|&s;elves, declined even
to be re-imbur&s;ed the Ex|pences they were at in going, and the Ma&s;ter of
the A&s;&s;embly-Room <HI>gave</HI> the U&s;e of it. From this confined
In&s;tance of &s;uch a Scheme, I am apt to think an Union of Poetry and
Mu&s;ic, executed on a larger Plan, would be an admirable
Two-Hours-Entertainment, either in a public Room or private Family.</P>
<P>I enclo&s;e a Piece of Writing, which a Friend of mine &s;ent me in
a Frank la&s;t Week. I think the Subject calculated for your Liking. It was
planned, and partly written, in Mr. HOARE's lovely Grounds, at
<HI>Stourton</HI> in <HI>Wilt|&s;hire</HI>; and the Thought &s;ugge&s;ted by
&s;urvey|ing, from an Eminence there, a woody Vale, wherein ALFRED is reported
to have once con|cealed him&s;elf from the <HI>Danes.</HI> Send it back, when
you have done with it.</P>

<HI>Fragments of Antient Poetry,</HI> printed at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> in the
Year 1760.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Edinburgh,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>June</HI> 21, 1760.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT gives me the greate&s;t Plea&s;ure, that I have an Opportunity of
conveying to a Per&s;on of your Ta&s;te, the inclo&s;ed Fragments of an|tient
<HI>Caledonian</HI> Poe&s;y&mdash; 
<Q> 
<L>"Full many a Gem of pure&s;t Ray &s;erene,</L> 
<L>"The dark unfathom'd Caves of Ocean bear,</L> 
<L>"Full many a Ro&s;e is born to blu&s;h un&s;een,</L> 
<L>"And wa&s;te its Sweetne&s;s on the de&s;art Air."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See GRAY's <HI>Elegy in a Country Church-Yard.</HI></NOTE></L></Q>
But Thanks to the Ta&s;te and Care of the in|genious Tran&s;lator, that we have
not to la|ment the utter Lo&s;s of tho&s;e Pieces, which reflect &s;o much
Lu&s;tre on the Memory of the original Bards. Here we &s;ee Poets framed by the
Hand of Nature; their Manners rude and <PB N="168" REF="177"> uncultivated, as
the Wilds they inhabited; unacquainted with ARISTOTLE and HORACE, but pouring
the (I had almo&s;t &s;aid) involun|tary Effu&s;ions of Minds filled with true
poe|tic Fire, deeply intere&s;ted in the Themes they &s;ung, devoid of all
Rules, they attach and warm the Heart, by an amazing though &s;e|cret Power,
the con&s;tant Effect of copying Nature, but copying her ju&s;tly; to which the
languid Efforts of Art bear &s;carce &s;o inte|re&s;ting a Proportion, as the
Shadow to the Sub&s;tance.</P>
<P>From the general Structure of the Poetry, from the Names of the
Per&s;ons celebrated in it, and the Hints of the <HI>Co&s;tume</HI> &s;cattered
here and there, it would appear, that the&s;e Poems were compo&s;ed about the
Time that the antient Bards of <HI>Iceland,</HI> and the other northern
Countries, made &s;o great a Figure in Poetry; or, perhaps, their Date may
reach back beyond the Time of Chri&s;tianity being preached in our I&s;lands;
hence it will follow, that our Ance&s;tors were ri&s;ing by &s;urpri&s;ing
Efforts to catch the faire&s;t Flowers of <HI>Par|na&s;&s;us,</HI> while the
polite Regions of <HI>Europe</HI> re|&s;ounded <PB N="169" REF="178"> with
polemic Theology and monki&s;h Non&s;en&s;e: this becomes the more probable,
when we reflect, that &s;carce any Trace of Chri&s;tianity is to be found in
the&s;e Pieces, and no Trace of the Names that prevailed after the ninth
Century, in&s;tead of which, the Names appear entirely Pagan; and numberle&s;s
Hints are taken from the predatory Life our Ance&s;tors (particularly tho&s;e
of the I&s;lands and north-we&s;t Coa&s;ts of <HI>Scotland)</HI> led before,
and at the fir&s;t preaching of the Go&s;pel among them. A critical Examination
of the original Language would help to throw &s;ome Light on this Conjecture,
as well as the Publication of Pieces of greater Length, which may follow
the&s;e fir&s;t Specimens. It is not, however, to be doubted, that the many
Fragments &s;till pre&s;erved among&s;t our Highlanders of their an|tient
Poetry, may be of great U&s;e in &s;ettling the Hi&s;tory, and a&s;certaining
the Meaning of &s;everal Antiquities di&s;per&s;ed over the moun|tainous Parts
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> while the Man of Ta&s;te mu&s;t be agreeably
&s;urpri&s;ed to find a Beauty and Force of Diction, a Warmth of Fancy, a
cha&s;te and truly noble Simplicy united, where hitherto no Per&s;on has ever
looked for it. <PB N="170" REF="179"> If the&s;e Specimens are well received by
the Public, and if &s;uitable Encouragement were given to the ingenious
Tran&s;lator, he would oblige the World with the Tran&s;lation of the Epic Poem
mentioned in the Preface, which con&s;i&s;ts of upwards of nine thou&s;and
Lines: but the dependant Situation of a Tutor can|not afford him Lei&s;ure to
undertake &s;o great a Work.</P>
<P>Your Friends in this Corner of the World were much di&s;appointed,
in not having the Happine&s;s of &s;eeing you la&s;t Summer along with Lord
LYTTELTON; and without Flattery I can a&s;&s;ure, that the Number of your
Friends in <HI>Scotland</HI> is greater than, perhaps, you think of, and every
one of them would be happy to have an Opportunity of &s;eeing and obli|ging
you. Lord ALEMOOR, Dr. ROEBUCK and his Spou&s;e de&s;ire to be remembered; and
I &s;hall take it as a particular Favour, that you would, at a lei&s;ure Hour,
write me your Opi|nion of the inclo&s;ed Specimens, and allow me to be with
E&s;teem, truly, dear Sir,</P>

<P>I KNOW no Way &s;o good of making up for my long Silence to you, as
&s;ending you the enclo&s;ed Poem, which if it gives you as much Plea&s;ure as
it did me, you will give me no &s;mall Thanks for: it is tran&s;lated from an
old Highland Poem, by one Mr. M' PHER|SON, a Mini&s;ter in the Highlands. There
are great Numbers of the&s;e Elegies all over the Highlands, which they &s;ing
to mournful Tunes in the Evening over their Fires. Mr. M' PHER|SON has, I hear,
tran&s;lated ten more of them, which I fancy will &s;oon be publi&s;hed; if
they are not, I &s;hall endeavour to get them, and &s;end them to you. It will
be needle&s;s to &s;ay <PB N="172" REF="181"> any Thing in Prai&s;e of the
Poem, as I think it can &s;ufficiently recommend it&s;elf. The Tran&s;|lation
has a great deal of Merit; I think it is one of the be&s;t I ever &s;aw. I
fancy SHEN|STONE will be much plea&s;ed with the Poem, which I &s;hall be
obliged to you if you will pre&s;ent to him with my Compliments.</P>

<P>Five Bards, who are the Gue&s;ts of a Chief, (him&s;elf an

<HEAD>LETTER XLIII. R. G&mdash;, E&s;q. to Mr. HULL.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>June</HI> 16.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear HULL,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I SAFE arrived in <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire,</HI> after two plea&s;ant
and ea&s;y Days Journey, and am now &s;et down to write to you, according to my
Promi&s;e, and to note what Alterations or Innovations I had ob&s;erved upon,
in the Modes and Manners of <HI>London,</HI> &s;ince I had not been there &s;o
long before.</P>
<P>This Chapter is reduced to &s;o few Heads, from the &s;everal
Conver&s;ations we had together in Town, upon the taking down the Signs, the
rooting up the Po&s;ts, the paving and lighting of <HI>Oxford-Road, Holborn,
Monmouth-Street,</HI> and <HI>St. Giles</HI>'s, the con&s;tructing of
<HI>Black-Friars-Bridge, &amp;c.</HI> that I cannot recollect any other Remark
I made worth mentioning, at pre&s;ent, except the introducing of A&s;&s;es in
the City, for the U&s;e of Milkmen, Fruiterers, Hawkers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="193">This I thought a great Improvement, as it
&s;erves to le&s;&s;en the Number of Barrows that u&s;ed to interrupt Walkers
on the broad Pave|ments; but this Con&s;ideration was damped again at &s;eeing
the barbarous Treatment the&s;e poor Animals often &s;uffer from their brutal
Guides or Riders. I often thought of STERNE upon the&s;e Occa&s;ions.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See a Pa&s;&s;age about an A&s;s in his <HI>Sentimental
Journey.</HI></NOTE> An A&s;s is a dull, &s;low Creature, that will not mend
its Pace for Whip or Spur&mdash;This the&s;e Wretches call
<HI>Ob&s;tinacy,</HI> and &s;o puni&s;h it for a Defect of Nature, as they
would for a moral Vice: for if they rea&s;on at all, you may be &s;ure they
rea&s;on thus, becau&s;e it is wrong.</P>
<P>This has renewed a Reflection in my Mind, that has often occurred to
me before, upon the unaccountable Di&s;po&s;ition towards Cruelty exerci&s;ed
again&s;t the Brute-Creation, which is too frequently ob&s;erved among the
general Cla&s;&s;es of Mankind, who have not been re|&s;trained by natural
Sentiment, or refined by a liberal Education.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="194">If Sympathy, as modern Philo&s;ophers
a&s;&s;ert, be the ultimate Cau&s;e of our being affected for others, that of
Pain, one would think, &s;hould be the &s;tronge&s;t. All Men do not feel
Misfortunes, or &s;uffer Grief, alike. One Per|&s;on may re&s;ent a
Mortification, or a Lo&s;s, to Madne&s;s; while his more temperate Friend can
afford his Pity or Compa&s;&s;ion no higher or further than his own
Pa&s;&s;ions or Sentiments would have extended in the &s;ame Circum&s;tances.
Here Sympathy is at an End. But all Per|&s;ons and Animals too are alike
&s;en&s;ible of Pain&mdash;<HI>Ergo</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>We have from hence Rea&s;on to conclude, that 'tis more from Want of
Thought, than of Humanity, that the contrary is &s;o apparent; and this
Argument, I think, is fully proved by the Ob&s;ervation, that Children and
Fools are the mo&s;t guilty of it.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides which, there is a great deal in Cu&s;|tom, that may take
off from the natural Feel|ings of Compa&s;&s;ion, with Regard to the
Brute-Creation, among Numbers of People, &s;uch as <PB N="186" REF="195">
Butchers, Surgeons, Soldiers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> A Fi&s;h|woman being reprehended
for the Barbarity of fleaing Eels alive, an&s;wered, that it was no Cruelty,
<HI>as they were &s;o much u&s;ed to it</HI>; which was plainly transferring
the In&s;en&s;ibility &s;he had her&s;elf acquired, through Habit, to the poor
&s;uf|fering Reptile. This puts me in Mind of the Blunder of an
<HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Parliament once, that framed an Act to puni&s;h Forgery with
the Lo&s;s of both Ears, and &s;o <HI>toties quoties.</HI></P>
<P>There is al&s;o, I apprehend, a Sort of No|tion re&s;ting in
unin&s;tructed Minds, that Mo|rality has nothing to do with our Actions
to|wards Brutes, any more than it has with Re|gard to inanimate Nature; &s;o
that many Folks, from &s;uch a &s;trange Mi&s;conception, torture an Animal
with as little Remor&s;e as they would lop off the Branch of a Tree. Such
People mu&s;t never have read the Sentence of SOLO|MON, that <HI>a good Man is
merciful to his Bea&s;t</HI>; nor that of SHAKESPEARE, 
<Q> 
<L>"The poor Beetle that we tread upon,</L> 
<L>"In corp'ral Suff'rance feels a Pang as great</L> 
<L>"As when a Giant dies."</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="196">I remember I was once &s;itting with a Friend,
and &s;eeing his Son tormenting a poor Dog, by making him &s;uffer great Pain,
I &s;pake to the Father, to reprove him for it; to which he coolly an&s;wered,
that as he de&s;igned the Boy for the Army, he did not care to in&s;pire him
with too tender Feelings. 
<Q REND="inline">"Your Idea might not be much ami&s;s,"</Q> I
replied, 
<Q REND="inline">"if you meant to breed him a Butcher, or a
Hangman."</Q> What a Gothic Notion, that Bravery and Hu|manity were
incompatible!</P>
<P>OVID &s;eems to have been of my Opinion in the above Reproof, by
making Prie&s;ts, who were the fir&s;t Butchers, or Sacrificers, to have led
the Way to Cruelty and Slaughter&mdash;
<Q> 
<L>Primoque a caede Ferarum</L> 
<L>Incalui&s;&s;e putem maculatum &s;anguine Ferrum.</L></Q> I will
not &s;ay, however, that this may be the Rea&s;on why Par&s;ons and Butchers
are equally excluded from being on Juries of Life and Death, becau&s;e there
would be a Sort of <HI>pert Dulne&s;s</HI> in the Remark&mdash;A&s;king Pardon
for the <PB N="188" REF="197"> Tautology&mdash;No; the true Rea&s;on for
the&s;e Exclu&s;ions is, that the latter are rendered cal|lous, from being too
familiar with Slaughter; and with Regard to the former, that the Mini|&s;ters
of Peace &s;hould keep clear of Blood.</P>
<P>A Thought has ju&s;t occurred to me. I have not Lei&s;ure both to
examine and to write it too, &s;o I &s;hall only &s;port it for the pre&s;ent.
Perhaps, the Injunction in the Levitical Law, to ab&s;tain from Blood, might
not have been meant in Derogation of <HI>Black-Puddings</HI> in the lea&s;t,
but only as a figurative Manner of re|peating the Sixth Commandment, 
<Q REND="inline">"Thou &s;halt do no Murder."</Q></P>
<P>A Comment upon the Inhibition of PYTHA|GORAS, <HI>Ab&s;tine &agrave;
Fabis,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ab&s;tain from Beans.</NOTE> has hinted
this No|tion to me; for the learned BACON, which Name, you know, accords very
well with <HI>Beans,</HI> &s;ays, that what the Sage intended by the
Pro|hibition was, to forbid meddling with the Con|tentions and Strife of
Electioneering, where the Votes or Suffrages were given, <HI>pro</HI> and
<HI>con,</HI> by black and white Beans.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="198">And this Interpretation ought certainly to
appear the true Sen&s;e of the Precept, from this Con&s;ideration; for as that
Philo&s;opher had before re&s;tricted his Di&s;ciples from the U&s;e of all
animal Food, on Account of the tran&s;mi|gratory Notions he had picked up in
<HI>India,</HI> he could not po&s;&s;ibly have been &s;o uncon&s;cio|nable, as
to have laid any Manner of Re&s;traint on the vegetable Product of the
Earth.</P>

<P>THE great Re&s;pect you, Sir, have &s;hewn to Mr. SHENSTONE, in
dedicating your Tragedy of ROSAMOND to his Memory, added to the Plea&s;ure I
have received from &s;ome of your other Publications, will, I tru&s;t, plead an

your Acceptance of the enclo&s;ed Poem; it was written by that Friend who&s;e
Death you &s;o feelingly lament; it has been in my Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion ever
&s;ince, or before that Period: of its Merits I am no Judge; but from its
Author, &s;hould imagine it not de&s;titute, and have long regretted its
remaining in Hands &s;o little capable of mak|ing it appear as it ought. The
&s;incere Plea|&s;ure I received, in &s;eeing Mr. SHENSTONE's Name &s;o
re&s;pectfully and publickly revived, induced me to wi&s;h to make the Author
&s;ome Acknowledgment, and this appears to be the <PB N="191" REF="200"> only
Way; for &s;hould not the <HI>Diamond</HI> have Brilliancy enough for the
Public, yet it may not be an unwelcome Amu&s;ement to a private Friend, to
remove the Dimne&s;s.</P>
<P>I &s;hould much &s;ooner have made this Ac|knowledgment, but from a
Diffidence of its being accepted; however, I hope the be&s;t, and that you will
be kind enough to accept it as it is meant. Should it prove worthy of No|tice,
and acceptable to &s;o partial a Friend, I &s;hall hope, (as I have no Copy) to
receive your Opinion; and mu&s;t reque&s;t it as a par|ticular Favour, that to
any Friend you chu&s;e to &s;hew it, my Name may not be mentioned; on that
Account I decline &s;aying any Thing of my&s;elf. My Addre&s;s is,

<HEAD>LETTER LVI. R. G&mdash;, E&s;q. to Mr. HULL.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received your Letter, and it has a&s;toni&s;hed me, that you can
be in the lea&s;t Degree hurt by the Opinion of narrow Minds. With Regard to
the Grievance you complain of; let it be always a Matter of Con&s;olation to
you, that the illiberal Treatment Actors may &s;ome|times meet with, on Account
of their Profe&s;&s;ion, can never proceed from any but illiberal Minds; 'tis
the Cen&s;urers them&s;elves who become Objects of Contempt, when they would
render you &s;o, <HI>from that Con&s;ideration merely:</HI> and this
Reflec|tion ought therefore to make you as indifferent to &s;uch In&s;tances of
Ignorance and Ill-breed|ing, <PB N="219" REF="226"> as you would be to a
<HI>Billing&s;gate</HI> Scold, or a St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s Abu&s;e.</P>
<P>An Actor is a re&s;pectable Character, while he properly
con&s;iders, and endeavours to pre&s;erve the original De&s;ign of his
Profe&s;&s;ion; and I have ever been of Opinion, and am convinced of the Truth
of the Maxim, that acting &s;hould unque&s;|tionably be accepted among the
Liberal Arts, even with this Advantage over Poetry and Pain|ting, that it
&s;uperadds Example to Document and Delight. 'Tis the <HI>living Moral,</HI>
while the others are but the <HI>dead Letter.</HI> The Stage is a School, and
may be an u&s;eful one too&mdash;As &s;uch it was patronized and cheri&s;hed by
the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t virtuous States of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI>;
and it has been the Fault of Managers, not of Actors, when|ever Theatres have
cea&s;ed to afford either Pre|cept or Example.</P>
<P>There are &s;o many Requi&s;ites of Talents, A&s;&s;iduity, and
Per&s;on, to form a complete Actor, that even a moderate Degree of Ex|cellence
&s;hould be deemed &s;ufficient Merit to entitle a Performer to the public
Favour and Indulgence: to which, if an hone&s;t, decent <PB N="220" REF="227">
and unexceptionable Repute be joined, I can &s;ee no Sort of Rea&s;on, in the
Nature or Di|&s;tinction of Things, why the <HI>Sock and Bu&s;kin</HI> &s;hould
not be admitted <HI>ad eundem</HI> with the <HI>Goif and Cowl</HI>; &s;o that
it mu&s;t be the <HI>per|&s;onal</HI> Character, and not the <HI>Dramatis
Per&s;onae,</HI> that can ever deba&s;e your Profe&s;&s;ion; in which
Predicament, both the Par&s;on and the Lawyer &s;tand equally with you.</P>
<P>But, indeed, the World, that illiberal Part of it which you hint at,
are apt to con&s;ider us Au|thors, al&s;o, in the &s;ame inferior Light they do
Actors. I remember a Friend of mine, &s;ome|time ago, was ca&s;t off by his
Father, for having publi&s;hed a very ingenious Poem, while he was a Student at
the Temple; and another Acquaintance was &s;everely reproved by his Re|lations,
for having married a Lady, every other Way worthy of his Choice, <HI>becau&s;e
&s;he had written a Book.</HI></P>
<P>Such curious Cen&s;ors, I &s;uppo&s;e, would de|&s;pi&s;e the
Meanne&s;s of my Spirit now, if I &s;hould declare to them, that I would rather
have been HOMER or VIRGIL, than ALEX|ANDER <PB N="221" REF="228"> or AUGUSTUS;
and ROSCIUS the Ac|tor, than the Tribune of the &s;ame Name; though the latter
was a Sort of Manager, as may be proved by his having framed the <HI>Lex
Ro&s;cia,</HI> for the Regulation of the Theatre at <HI>Rome.</HI> But it might
po&s;&s;ibly reconcile them to me again, if I &s;hould confe&s;s this common
Foible of human Nature, at the &s;ame Time, that fond as I am of Fame, I would
yet rather be even what I am my&s;elf <HI>now,</HI> than the be&s;t of them all
<HI>then.</HI> This is &s;ome Sort of Qua|lification to the former
Sentiment.</P>
<P>I &s;hall here conclude my Letter to you, with intreating, that you
will continue to de|feat the Malice of &s;uch ignorant Cen&s;ors, by an uniform
Attention to the Spirit and Utility of that <HI>Walk</HI> in Life, which either
Fortune, or your own Choice, has led you into. Elevate your Cre&s;t; take

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN you undertook to be the Ama|nuen&s;is, as well as the
Receiver-Gene|ral to the agreeable Society I have left with &s;o much Regret, I
remember you charged me to write as &s;oon as I &s;hould reach this Place; I
accordingly begin my Ta&s;k, and am very happy to have an Opportunity of
writing to you a good long Letter, without the Expence of Po&s;tage, which I
have not the Vanity to &s;up|po&s;e my Epi&s;tles de&s;erve; I &s;end this by a
pretty Sort of Man, who&s;e Name is &mdash;, and who, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e,
has &s;ome &s;trong Attachment in your County, which induces him to take &s;o
long a Journey at this rude Sea&s;on of the Year.</P>
<P>We were very fortunate in Weather, and found the Roads as good as
the Nature of the <PB N="224" REF="231"> Country will allow them to be. Some
Parts of <HI>Savoy</HI> is frightfully wild and dreary, other Parts very
romantic and beautiful. I was va&s;t|ly amu&s;ed with the Manner of
cro&s;&s;ing Mount <HI>Cenis:</HI> the Chair we are carried in, or rather
<HI>on,</HI> re&s;emble a good deal a <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Palanquin, only they
want a Canopy over them; the Chairmen are certainly the be&s;t in the World, or
it would be both dangerous and frightful; it &s;eems to me, that they have the
Strength of Mules, and the Agility of Goats, for they run down the Precipices,
and bound from Rock to Rock, in a mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing Manner. The A&s;cent
of the Mountain is three Miles, on the Side of <HI>Savoy,</HI> the Plain on the
Top, &s;ix Miles in Length, and the De&s;cent on the <HI>Turin</HI> Side, &s;ix
Miles more; we had four Men to each of the Ladies' Chairs, and &s;ix to the
Gentlemen's, and after carrying us the&s;e fifteen dreadful Miles, they were
quite delighted that our Party took them on from <HI>Novale&s;e</HI> (a &s;mall
Town at the Foot of Mount <HI>Cenis)</HI> to <HI>Su&s;a,</HI> which is nine
Miles further, and they carried us the la&s;t three Leagues in an Hour and a
Half, laughing and je&s;ting with each other all the Way, as if they had been
doing a Thing <PB N="225" REF="232"> merely for Sport and Amu&s;ement; &s;o you
&s;ee, my dear Sir, how vi&s;ible the Goodne&s;s of Pro|vidence is to all
Creatures; the&s;e poor Souls, who &s;pend all their Lives in the utmo&s;t
In|digence, and inhabit a Country that &s;eems only fit for Savages, if they
are denied the Luxu|ries of Life, are amply repaid, in the Enjoy|ment of a
double Portion of Health and Strength.</P>
<P>We &s;topped a few Days at <HI>Lyons, Turin, Milan</HI> and
<HI>Verona,</HI> and &s;aw every Thing wor|thy a Stranger's Curio&s;ity, in
each of the&s;e fine Cities; nothing amu&s;ed me more, than &s;eeing a Parcel
of <HI>Angels</HI> walking about the Streets of <HI>Milan,</HI> they were fine
Cherry-cheek'd Boys, ready dre&s;&s;ed for a grand Proce&s;&s;ion that was
preparing for the Day following, in Ho|nour of the <HI>Virgin Mary</HI>'s
Birth-Day. <HI>Venice</HI> is a very magnificent Place, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es
the Charm of Novelty in a much higher Degree than any of the other Places I
have named; 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to give a &s;tronger Idea of it, 'tis in a
Stile &s;o peculiar to it&s;elf. The Ma&s;k|ing is begun, which is extremely
entertaining: I &s;hould be exce&s;&s;ively happy to pop in among&s;t 
<PB N="226" REF="233"> your dear Society &s;ome Day, when you are all
a&s;|&s;embled; I a&s;&s;ure you, it would be no &s;mall Surprize to &s;ee me
in a <HI>Venetian</HI> Dre&s;s; it con&s;i&s;ts of a long black &s;ilk Cloak,
called here a <HI>Tabora,</HI> a <HI>Baouta,</HI> which is made of black Lace,
three Quarters of a Yard long, and five Times as wide, and hangs about the
Shoul|ders like a Petticoat; it has a Hood to it, which, when you choo&s;e to
be concealed, covers the bottom Part of the Face to the upper Lip, the re&s;t
is hid by a white Ma&s;k, and the Women wear on their Heads a Man's Hat
&s;martly cocked; the <HI>Venetian</HI> Women, who are rather ma&s;culine in
their Manner, look &s;till more &s;o in this Dre&s;s.</P>
<P>We have had the Prince of <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> here for ten Days,
which made the Town all alive. I will de&s;cribe to you one of the
Entertain|ments made for him, and that will &s;erve as a Specimen of all the
Re&s;t. Our Re&s;ident had not got then into his Palace, (as it is ju&s;tly
called, for it is indeed a noble one) &s;o that he could not make any
Entertainments for the Prince, but he gave him &s;ome excellent Mu|&s;ic one
Morning in a private Manner, which <PB N="227" REF="234" MS="y"> he &s;eemed to
enjoy the more for being &s;o. The Night after his Highne&s;s's Arrival, Count
DURAZZO, the Imperial Amba&s;&s;ador, invited all the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> the
foreign Nobility that don't belong to <HI>Venice,</HI> and all the foreign
Mini&s;ters, to meet the Prince at Supper. The Amba&s;&s;a|dre&s;s received her
Gue&s;ts with mingled Grace and Dignity, &s;he is really a fine Woman, and her
Beauty was heightened by all the Elegance of Dre&s;s; &s;oon after the Company
were a&s;|&s;embled, a mo&s;t delightful Serenade began upon the Water, which
was not only delightful to the Ear, but formed a very beautiful Object to the
Sight, for the Mu&s;icians were placed in a large open Barge finely
illuminated; the Har|mony drew around them an infinite Number of Gondolas
belonging to the noble Venetians, who could no otherwi&s;e partake of this
Fea&s;t; for by their Laws they are &s;ecluded from all Commerce with Strangers
that are in a public Character. At proper Intervals of the Mu&s;ic, all Sorts
of Refre&s;hments, of Ices, Fruits, Sweat-meats, Lemonades, <HI>&amp;c.
&amp;c.</HI> were pre&s;ented to the Company, who, when they had li&s;tened to
the Serenade for &s;ome Time, changed the Scene, either &s;at down to Cards, or
formed little chat|ting <PB N="228" REF="235"> Parties. When the Card-Tables
broke up, a very elegant Concert, compo&s;ed of a few choice Pieces of Mu&s;ic,
performed by the very be&s;t Hands, agreeably filled up Time, till a mo&s;t
magnificent Supper was &s;erved. When the Company ro&s;e from Table, Coffee was
brought, which is the Cu&s;tom here after Supper, as well as after Dinner; when
this was over, a &s;uperb Barge attended, in which the Prince, and all the
Ladies, and a &s;uitable Number of Gentlemen were placed, and rowed to St.
<HI>Mark's</HI> (which is the only public Place here for walking) followed by
the Mu&s;ic, the re&s;t of the Company in their Gondolas, and tho&s;e of the
noble <HI>Venetians</HI> which the Harmony had attracted. After walking for
&s;ome Time to enjoy the cool Air, the Company retired to a very elegant
Apartment, which the Am|ba&s;&s;adre&s;s has on the Place of St. <HI>Mark,</HI>
where &s;he receives her Company, when &s;he chu&s;es to be in private. When we
had chatted here for Half an Hour, it was found to be a proper Time to retire,
as it was three o'Clock in the Morning; and &s;o ended this agreeable Even,
every Part of which was employed in &s;ome innocent Amu&s;e|ment, without any
Thing being hurried or con|fu&s;ed. <PB N="229" REF="236"> I have been the more
particular in this Account, that you may &s;ee, my good Friend, that Ta&s;te
and Elegance is no more wanting in <HI>Venice,</HI> than it is in the gay
Metropolis of <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>I hope you will &s;oon indulge me with a Letter, and that it will
bring me a good Account of your&s;elf, and every worthy Indi|vidual of our
Friends in Friend&s;hip a&s;&s;embled; &s;end it in a Frank to Mr. L&mdash;, in
&mdash; Street, <HI>London,</HI> and he will put it in his Ex|cellency's
Packet: it mu&s;t be but a &s;ingle Letter, but I hope it will contain a good
deal. I long to hear that your good Mother is well re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in her
Health, &s;he is a worthy Soul, and one cannot help wi&s;hing &s;uch People to
live for ever; I hope, my dear Friend, though &s;uch a cruel Di&s;tance divides
us, that I am not e&s;teemed the le&s;s a Member of the friendly Society, than
if I was with you; I find the &s;ame Warmth of Affection towards the happy
Circle, as if I was not an <HI>Ab&s;en|tee,</HI> therefore beg you will give my
be&s;t Af|fections to all the happy Members.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="237">I went the other Day to &s;ee the Ceremony of
a Nun taking the la&s;t Veil, and 'tis very awful and melancholy, and, to
&s;peak hone&s;tly and unprudi&s;hly, does not in&s;pire me with the lea&s;t
De&s;ire to be a Nun: fir&s;t, the divine Service is performed with very fine
Mu&s;ic, both vocal and in&s;trumental, in the Church of the Convent; then a
little Door is opened in the Grate of the private Chapel, before which the Nun
is &s;eated on a Chair of State under a Canopy, with a Prayer-Book in her Hand,
till the Service is fini&s;hed; &s;he then comes forward, and kneeling at the
Grate, repeats to a Prie&s;t the Vows of the Order, and promi&s;es Obedience to
the Abbe&s;s; &s;he then ri&s;es, and the Nuns take off her white Veil, and put
on a black one, after which &s;he kneels and &s;ays &s;ome Prayers: then &s;ix
of the Si&s;ters advance, and hold over her a purple Pall, whil&s;t Part of the
Funeral-Service is read, during which Time &s;he is &s;uppo&s;ed to be
<HI>dead</HI>; they then take away the purple Cloth, and the Abbe&s;s places on
her Head a Crown richly ornamented with Jewels, to &s;ignify that &s;he dies to
the World and ri&s;es again to Glory; &s;he then receives <PB N="231" REF="238"> from the Prie&s;t a Tablet, with the Rules of the Order, which &s;he
reads over and ki&s;&s;es; then, with the Tablet in one Hand, and a long wax
Taper, ornamented with Wreaths of Flow|ers, in the other, &s;he walks &s;lowly
round the Chapel, followed by the re&s;t of the Nuns, and depo&s;its the Tablet
on the Altar. Thus ends the melancholy Ceremony. This young Lady was very
pretty, and not above &s;eventeen; we all thought &s;he had an Appearance of
great Con&s;traint in her Chearfulne&s;s, but we were a&s;&s;ured, it was
entirely her Choice, that &s;he had a large Fortune, had buried her Father, and
was Mi&s;tre&s;s of her&s;elf; perhaps it may be the Ta&s;te of the Family, for
another Si&s;|ter profe&s;&s;ed la&s;t Year in the &s;ame Convent.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Venice,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>Dec.</HI> 25, 1765.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MAY every Ble&s;&s;ing of this chearful Sea|&s;on await you, and
every Individual of the happy Family and Friends you are with! May your
Plea&s;ures be unmixed with Pain, and your Years numerous and
happy!&mdash;Re|ceive the&s;e fervent Wi&s;hes of an exiled Mem|ber of your
worthy Society, and be a&s;&s;ured, that though you are all Ab&s;ent from my
Sight, you are ever pre&s;ent to my Mind. I wrote you a long Letter, near three
Months ago, by an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Gentleman, who a&s;&s;ured me, he &s;hould
be in your Part of the World as &s;oon as the Po&s;t; when lo, and behold!
three Weeks ago I heard of him at <HI>Sienna,</HI> where, I &s;up|po&s;e, he
will &s;tay the Winter; therefore, as I am quite in the Dark, in Regard to the
Fate of my unfortunate Epi&s;tle, I could not be ea&s;y till I had again &s;et
Pen to Paper, <PB N="233" REF="240"> to reque&s;t you will all continue to love
me as I do you, which I a&s;&s;ure you, my dear Sir, is with undimini&s;hed
Truth. I believe I told you in my la&s;t, how to forward a Letter to me, but
for fear you have never received it, I will repeat it; if you can &s;end it to
any Friend in <HI>London,</HI> and get them to forward it by the Penny Po&s;t
to Mr. L&mdash;, in &mdash; Street, he will enclo&s;e it in the Secretary of
State's Packet, by which Means, I &s;hall be more certain of getting it &s;afe,
than by the Po&s;t, as well as that I &s;hall receive it free.</P>
<P>I have a great Favour, my dear Sir, to beg of you, which is, that
you will procure me a Piece of Information for the U&s;e of our Re&s;ident, in
Regard to a young Gentleman who has been at <HI>Venice</HI> for &s;ome Time,
and &s;eems in no Hurry to leave it, owing, as we imagine, to an Attachment to
a fair <HI>Venetian</HI> Lady; his Name is &mdash;, his Family, he &s;ays, is
&s;ettled near <HI>F&mdash;</HI> in <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire</HI>; he makes a
genteel Appearance in Point of Fortune, and &s;eems to be a mode&s;t, pretty
behaved young Man, upon which Account, his Excel|lency wi&s;hes to &s;hew him
any Civility in his <PB N="234" REF="241"> Power; but, at the &s;ame Time,
would be glad to be rightly informed, as to his Character and Family, before he
receives him in an in|timate Manner. I thought it was very pro|bable, Mr.
D&mdash; might know his Father. I have &s;ome Notion, I have heard the Name
mentioned at Mr. B&mdash;'s; if, my dear Sir, you can procure me a particular
Account of this young Hero, I &s;hall e&s;teem it as a great Fa|vour.</P>
<P>I am become wonderfully fond of the ma&s;|quing Dre&s;s, and am
told, I wear it ju&s;t as well as a <HI>Venetian</HI>; 'tis the mo&s;t
comfortable, warm, Walking-Dre&s;s that can be conceived; I have kept Hou&s;e
the&s;e la&s;t nine Days, be|cau&s;e it was prohibited, but to-morrow
Ma&s;|quing begins again, and continues till Lent. I am told we had an
Earthquake, but, thank God, I did not perceive it: &s;ince that, there had been
very tempe&s;tuous Weather, and vio|lent Snow and Rain, which, added to a high
Tide, overflowed all the Canals, and I can't but &s;ay, at that Time
<HI>Venice</HI> gave me a &s;trong Idea of the univer&s;al Deluge.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="242">There have been five Theatres open till within
the&s;e nine Days, and I am told, in the Carnival there will be no le&s;s than
&s;even. The comic Opera was very plea&s;ing, in Point of Mu&s;ic, and always
crouded; but the &s;erious Opera nobody could bear, though MANZOLI &s;ung in
it, and TIBALDI, who is reckoned one of the be&s;t tenor Voices, if not the
very be&s;t, now living. By this you will perceive how the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
and <HI>Italian</HI> Ta&s;te for Mu&s;ic differs; though I mu&s;t &s;ay, I
believe the great|e&s;t Admirers of MANZOLI would allow he is much altered for
the wor&s;e; for my own Part, had I not remembered his Per&s;on, I &s;hould not
have had the lea&s;t Recollection of him from his Voice. The Theatre, he
performed at, was entirely fitted up with Gla&s;s, both the Stage and all the
Boxes, which, when well lighted, had a fine Effect. There was a Change of the
Scenes for one of the Dances, that was, I think one of the mo&s;t beautiful
Things I ever beheld.</P>
<P>The <HI>Italian</HI> Comedy does not delight me much, for I do not
under&s;tand the Language <PB N="236" REF="243"> well enough yet, to be
amu&s;ed with the <HI>Bon|mots</HI> of HARLEQUIN, and to laugh at him becau&s;e
he has a black Face, and at PAN|TALOON, merely for having a long Beard; it is
not what I feel my&s;elf much di&s;po&s;ed to do. I under&s;tand the
<HI>Italian</HI> Tragedies better than the Comedies, but I find the Actors
in|finitely below ours. I intend to be very &s;tu|dious, and when all the
Family are gadding to the Opera and the Play, I &s;hall &s;it at home and
drudge at the <HI>Italian,</HI> and this for many good Rea&s;ons, but chiefly
to acquit my|&s;elf of my chief Promi&s;e to you.</P>
<P>We have, at pre&s;ent, a &s;econd Edition of the Prince of
<HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> who has been at <HI>Ve|nice</HI> a Week, but on
<HI>Monday</HI> next he leaves us entirely. This Time he has &s;pent mo&s;t of
his lei&s;ure Hours with our Re&s;ident, and expre&s;&s;es great Plea&s;ure in
being received on an intimate and ea&s;y Footing; he is really a very
&s;en&s;ible and agreeable Man, and as far as can be judged from outward
Appearance, is very amiable: he has with him two young <HI>German</HI> Barons,
who are al&s;o very pretty Kind <PB N="237" REF="244"> of Men, and &s;peak
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;o well, that it is a Comfort to hear them.</P>
<P>My Brother de&s;ires me to pre&s;ent his be&s;t Re&s;pects to you,
and I hope my dear nominal Uncle will always be mindful to &s;ay for me to the
dear Society every Thing that is kind, grateful, and affectionate.</P>
<P>My Vanity will not &s;uffer me to pa&s;s over in Silence a
Conque&s;t that I am told I have certainly made, of an <HI>Italian</HI> Count,
who is here in a public Character; he is not quite &s;ixty, his Figure and
Complexion exactly re|&s;embles a very bad, long, thin Tallow-Candle; he is
much bedaubed with <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Snuff, and on meagre Days &s;o overcomes
one with Gar|lick, that it is dreadful; except the&s;e little Accidents, he is
a mo&s;t agreeable Companion, for he is very &s;en&s;ible, very religious, very
philo&s;ophic, extremely polite, and his Conver|&s;ation is both in&s;tructive
and amu&s;ing. Now, my good Friend, from the Picture I have drawn, would you
not think I was in &s;ome Danger of lo&s;ing my Heart, but that luckily 
<PB N="238" REF="245"> my amiable Count is a bigotted Roman Ca|tholic, and I an
ob&s;tinate <HI>Heretick?</HI></P>
<P>We may give our&s;elves what Airs we plea&s;e about our
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liberty, but for the <HI>Ladies, Italy</HI> is undoubtedly
the Land of perfect Free|dom; to all public Places, they con&s;tantly go in
Pairs, with their <HI>Cavalier Serventes,</HI> and put me much in Mind of the
<HI>clean</HI> and <HI>unclean</HI> Bea&s;ts going into the Ark. What would
be|come of the Reputation of a mi&s;erable <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Woman, if &s;he
was to go to the Play with a Man <HI>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te?</HI> And
yet that is con&s;tantly done here without Imputation of Wrong&mdash;In
&s;hort, if a Woman has any Mind to be wicked, <HI>Venice</HI> &s;eems to be
the la&s;t Place in the World to give her better Sentiments.</P>
<P>How delighted &s;hould I be to &s;urprize the dear Society, &s;ome
Night or other, when you are over your &s;ober Game of Quadrille, in my white
Ma&s;que and Man's Hat; you have no Notion with what an Air I have learnt to
put it over my right Eye. I will not de|&s;pair but that we may again meet
happily under that ho&s;pitable Roof, where for &s;ome <PB N="239" REF="246">
Weeks, in the Enjoyment of &s;uch friendly Conver&s;ation, I ta&s;ted more real
Happine&s;s and Peace than I ever experienced <HI>before</HI> or
<HI>&s;ince</HI> in my whole Life. I did not know, be|fore I had the melancholy
Experience of it, how very irk&s;ome and painful a Feel it is, to be &s;o very
far from tho&s;e we truly regard. Adieu! my dear Friends, may Heaven &s;hower
upon you all its choice&s;t Ble&s;&s;ings, is the &s;in|cere and con&s;tant
Prayer of your ever faithful and affectionate</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Venice,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>April</HI> 3, 1766.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE only Ta&s;k you enjoined me on lea|ving <HI>England,</HI> is,
perhaps, the mo&s;t dif|ficult you could have exacted from me; never|thele&s;s,
I am re&s;olved to attempt it; for, how|ever you may be di&s;appointed in my
Perfor|mance, I &s;hall, at lea&s;t, have the Satisfaction 
<PB N="240" REF="247"> of proving, that I chearfully obey any Com|mand of
yours, and though &s;urrounded with Difficulties, I enter upon the Performance
of my Promi&s;e with Courage; well knowing, from the Candour of your
Di&s;po&s;ition, that you will accept of an earne&s;t De&s;ire on my Part to
gratify your laudable Curio&s;ity, in Lieu of greater Abilities for &s;uch an
Undertaking.</P>
<P>I am not &s;urpri&s;ed, that a Per&s;on of your &s;peculative Turn
&s;hould feel an earne&s;t De&s;ire to be made acquainted with &s;ome
Particulars relative to the wi&s;e and complicated Govern|ment of the Republic
of <HI>Venice</HI>; it ju&s;tly merits the Attention of the &s;en&s;ible and
curious Part of Mankind, were it only to di&s;cover by what Means it has been
pre&s;erved nearly in the &s;ame State, for &s;uch a Number of Ages; but it is
hardly po&s;&s;ible to arrive with Certainty at this Knowledge; for there is no
Subject the <HI>Vene|tians</HI> are &s;o tenacious of conver&s;ing upon as
Politicks, profound Secrecy being the great Engine on which this very
&s;ingular Govern|ment turns. I find <HI>one mu&s;t</HI> not depend too much on
the Accounts of tho&s;e who have written upon the Subject, for after allowing 
<PB N="241" REF="248"> the utmo&s;t to their Integrity and Indu&s;try, they
mu&s;t have been often liable to Mi&s;infor|mation, be&s;ides the unavoidable
Change that Time naturally produces in all &s;ublunary Things. I have now lying
before me a Hi|&s;tory of the Republic, by AMELOT DE LA HOUSSAI, one by ST.
DISDIER, and another by the ABB&Eacute;E LANGIER, of a much later Date; and I
&s;hall freely tran&s;cribe from the&s;e Authors, in as &s;uccinct a Manner as
po&s;&s;ible, all &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ages as coincide with the pre&s;ent State of
Things: but the mo&s;t plea&s;ing A&s;|&s;i&s;tant I promi&s;e my&s;elf is, Mr.
SMITH, who has been &s;ettled in this City a great Number of Years, and was
formerly the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Con|&s;ul; he is now retired from Bu&s;ine&s;s,
and de|votes his Time to the Study and Encourage|ment of the polite Arts, of
which he is a li|beral Protector; he is, at pre&s;ent, appointed
<HI>Charg&eacute; d'Affaires,</HI> by our Court, till the Ar|rival of Sir JAMES
WRIGHT, who &s;ucceeds the pre&s;ent Amba&s;&s;ador at
<HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> in the Re&s;ident&s;hip of <HI>Venice.</HI> I am
&s;orry the new Mini&s;ter is not expected during my Stay here, for, as I am
told, he has &s;pent &s;ome Time in this Capital, when upon his Travels in a
pri|vate <PB N="242" REF="249"> Character. Under his Au&s;pices, I might,
perhaps, with more Ea&s;e, have pur&s;ued my Re&s;earches. Mr. SMITH is an
intelligent, &s;en&s;i|ble Man, and pre&s;erves, in a very advanced Age, a
Degree of Politene&s;s, Vivacity and Good-Humour, rarely to be met with, which
renders his Conver&s;ation as plea&s;ing as it is in&s;tructive. This Gentleman
is married to the Si&s;ter of Mr. MURRAY, the late Re&s;ident, a very amiable
Woman; their Hou&s;e is open every Evening to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> in the
mo&s;t ea&s;y, agreeable Manner, where I have infinite Plea|&s;ure in talking
over, in a polite chearful Cir|cle, the <HI>Virt&ugrave;</HI> that has engaged
my Attention in the Morning; but through this Corre&s;pon|dence, I &s;hall not
prophane my favourite Sub|ject, by introducing it with the dry one, your
Curio&s;ity has led me to.</P>
<P>As ST. DISDIER is my favourite Writer on the State of
<HI>Venice,</HI> I &s;hall begin with his Account of the Origin of this City,
but mu&s;t fir&s;t endeavour to make you acquainted with the <HI>Lagunes,</HI>
(or Lakes) which I look upon to be the great Sources of Health and Plea|&s;ure,
to the <HI>Venetians,</HI> as well as the Means <PB N="243" REF="250"> by which
all their Wants are &s;upplied; nothing can be more delicious, than the Airings
the Nobility take on the&s;e Lakes during the Sum|mer Sea&s;on, &s;ometimes
attended with a Barge filled with Mu&s;icians, and often
<HI>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</HI> with their <HI>Cici&s;beo,</HI> in a
Gondola, which is an ea&s;y and luxurious Conveyance. The <HI>Lagunes</HI> are
formed by a &s;trong Bank of Sand, at the En|trance of the Gulph, which extends
from South to We&s;t about thirty-&s;ix Miles, and is about &s;ix Hundred Feet
in Breadth; the Sea, ha|ving broke through the Bank in &s;ix different Places,
has covered with Water all the low Land for &s;even or eight Miles, leaving a
Num|ber of &s;mall I&s;lands, upon which are built the Towns of the
<HI>Lagunes.</HI> The &s;ix Pa&s;&s;ages above|mentioned, are the only Ports by
which Ve&s;|&s;els can approach to <HI>Venice.</HI> Fir&s;t, that of
<HI>Brondolo,</HI> to the South; &s;econdly, <HI>Chio&s;a,</HI> (an epi&s;copal
City;) thirdly, <HI>Malamocco</HI>; fourthly, <HI>Lido,</HI> (oppo&s;ite to the
Ea&s;t Point of <HI>Venice;)</HI> fifthly, <HI>St. Era&s;mus,</HI> and
&s;ixthly, the three Ports; by this la&s;t, only the &s;mall fi&s;hing Barks
can pa&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="251">In the Year 407, the <HI>Goths,</HI> under the
Com|mand of RADAGAISUS, having broke like a Torrent into <HI>Italy,</HI> put
all the Inhabitants to the Sword, who attempted to oppo&s;e their Fury; the
People who were &s;ituated near the <HI>Lagunes</HI> (I have above de&s;cribed)
found no A&s;ylum &s;o &s;ecure as tho&s;e maritime I&s;les, the mo&s;t Part of
which were only inhabited by Fi&s;hermen: here the Fugitives remained in
Safety, until the Ge|nerals, &s;ent by the Emperor HONORIUS, (having defeated
the Barbarians) left the affrighted Wan|derers at Liberty to return to the
<HI>Terra Firma.</HI> In the Year 413, the horrible Ravages com|mitted by the
<HI>Vi&s;igoths,</HI> under ALARICK, made the &s;ame People a &s;econd Time
&s;eek their for|mer Retreat; and as the&s;e Invaders &s;taid longer in
<HI>Italy</HI> than tho&s;e led by RADAGAISUS, the Fugitives began to build
them&s;elves comforta|ble Habitations on the&s;e I&s;lands. The
<HI>Paduans,</HI> to whom the&s;e I&s;les belonged, had a Port at that of
<HI>Rialto,</HI> (now called <HI>Venice)</HI> and the Senate having re&s;olved
to make it a con&s;ide|rable Place, not only by Way of A&s;ylum for their
Subjects, but al&s;o to &s;ecure their Trade by Sea, &s;ent, in the Year 441,
three Con&s;uls, who proclaimed it a free Port, &s;o that in a 
<PB N="245" REF="252"> &s;hort Time it was peopled, not only by tho&s;e who
retired to the I&s;lands for Safety, but by many Per&s;ons of all Ranks, who
left the <HI>Terra Firma</HI> to &s;ettle there. The third Undertaking of the
Barbarians, under ATTILA, King of the <HI>Huns,</HI> threatened <HI>Italy</HI>
with total De&s;olation; that Scourge of the <HI>Almighty,</HI> as he was
ju&s;tly denominated, having cau&s;ed <HI>Germany, France,</HI> and
<HI>Italy,</HI> to be laid Wa&s;te, returned in the Year 453 a &s;econd Time
into the la&s;t-named Country, and de&s;troyed <HI>Pavia, Milan, Padua,
Aquilea,</HI> and many other great Towns, the mi&s;erable Remains of who&s;e
Inhabitants fini&s;h|ed the Peopling not only of <HI>Rialto,</HI> but all the
other I&s;les of the <HI>Lagunes</HI>; and entertain|ing no Hope of returning
to their ruined Ci|ties, they cau&s;ed to be tran&s;ported from the <HI>Terra
Firma,</HI> Marble, and other Materials of their demoli&s;hed Palaces; &s;o
that, in the Space of about fifty Years, not only the People of Rank, but even
the Artizans, were conve|niently lodged. <HI>Padua</HI> being at length
re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, and &s;eeing <HI>Rialto</HI> become con&s;iderable, by the
Number of its Inhabitants, the Senate thought proper to &s;end Con&s;uls to
govern the People, with &s;ome Appearance of Authority; <PB N="246" REF="253">
but in Time the riche&s;t and mo&s;t powerful of the Inhabitants of the&s;e
I&s;les got them&s;elves declared Protectors of the People, with the Title of
Tribunes. In the Year 709, the Tri|bunes of the twelve mo&s;t con&s;iderable
I&s;lands of the <HI>Lagunes,</HI> judging it nece&s;&s;ary to have a better
Form of Government, re&s;olved to com|po&s;e a Republic, and to elect a proper
Per&s;on from among them&s;elves to be their Chief or Prince; but as they knew
they had no Right to take this Step again&s;t the Will of the
<HI>Pa|duans,</HI> to whom they were indebted for the Place of their
Re&s;idence, they &s;ent an Amba&s;|&s;y to the Emperor LEO, who was Sovereign
of the whole Country, and to Pope JOHN the Fifth, to obtain their
Permi&s;&s;ion to elect a Prince, to whom they gave the Title of Doge. PAOLO
LUCE ANAFESTE, the fir&s;t Duke of <HI>Venice,</HI> was elected 288 Years after
<HI>Rialto</HI> was proclaimed a free Port by the <HI>Paduans.</HI> This
Election was made at <HI>Ereclea,</HI> a Town of the <HI>Lagunes,</HI> in the
Year 709; at this Place, the fir&s;t three Doges re&s;ided. The&s;e Princes
ruled with ab&s;olute Power till 1172, when, upon the Election of SEBASTIAN
ZIANI, the Form of Government became democratical, and <PB N="247" REF="254">
continued &s;o till 1289, when the Doge, PIETRO GRADENIGO, found Means to
change it to an Ari&s;tocracy; this he effected by getting a De|cree pa&s;&s;ed
in the <HI>Quarantia Criminale,</HI> that all tho&s;e who had compo&s;ed the
great Council for four Years, &s;hould be ballotted for in that Chamber of
Ju&s;tice, and &s;uch of them who had twelve Balls in their Favour, and who
attended the Council on a certain Day, at an appointed Hour, &s;hould have
their Names written in a Book, called <HI>Il Libro d'Oro,</HI> and that they
and their De&s;cendants &s;hould form the great Council forever. As this
Intrigue was managed with much Secrecy, none had Notice to attend, but tho&s;e
whom the Doge and his Party approved of, or who had Friends in the
<HI>Quarantia.</HI> When this cho&s;en Number were a&s;&s;embled, at the
Ringing of a Bell, the Doors were locked, and no more &s;uffered to enter. This
the <HI>Venetians</HI> call 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Il Serrar del Can&s;iglio,</HI>"</Q> and is one
of the mo&s;t remark|able Epochas of their Government: though this Step
wre&s;ted all Share of the Admini&s;tra|tion out of the Hands of the Citizens,
and unju&s;tly deprived &s;ome Families of their Ti|tle to Nobility, yet it was
owing to this Event, <PB N="248" REF="255"> that the Republic e&s;tabli&s;hed a
more perfect Form of Government than &s;he before enjoyed, and which continues,
with very little Change, to this Day. BAYAMONTE TIEPOLI, the Head of one of the
mo&s;t antient Families of the Republic, joined the <HI>Quirini,</HI> and
&s;ome other illu&s;trious Per&s;ons, in a Con&s;piracy to &s;acrifice the Doge
to their Re&s;entment, for this Innova|tion; but all the Con&s;pirators
peri&s;hed in the Enterpri&s;e, and this Attempt only occa&s;ioned fre&s;h
Regulations, which more &s;ecurely e&s;tabli&s;h|ed the new Form of
Government.</P>
<P>Accept of thus much, by Way of Intro|duction to a Sketch of the
pre&s;ent State of the Republic of <HI>Venice,</HI> and in my next, I &s;hall
have the Honour to introduce you to SUA SERENITA, the Doge, but at pre&s;ent

<P>I Promi&s;ed in my la&s;t to introduce you to the Doge of
<HI>Venice,</HI> and I think you will agree with me, that his Serenity is a
very uncomfortable Being. Since the Period of <HI>Il Serrar del
Con&s;iglio,</HI> his Power has gra|dually decrea&s;ed. A Procurator of St.
<HI>Mark</HI> is generally elected Prince, who has &s;er|ved the Republic in
expen&s;ive Emba&s;&s;ies, or in the fir&s;t Offices of the State. Although he
has the Name of Sovereign, the Power remains with the Senate; and having little
Influence in the Affairs of the State, great Wi&s;dom is by no Means an
e&s;&s;ential Recom|mendation to this high Rank; an advanced Age, an ea&s;y
Di&s;po&s;ition, and illu&s;trious Birth, are the Qualifications chiefly
&s;ought for in the Doge; his Children, Grand-Children, and Bro|thers are
di&s;qualified from holding any con&s;i|derable <PB N="250" REF="257">
Employment connected with Govern|ment during his Reign. His Wife was for|merly
treated <HI>en Prince&s;&s;e,</HI> and crowned with great Magnificence, but
that cu&s;tom is now exploded; however, &s;he &s;till retains the Title of
<HI>Dogere&s;&s;a.</HI> Though the Doge pre&s;ides at all the Councils, he is
only acknowledged Head of the Senate, at the Tribunals, and in the Palace of
St. <HI>Mark.</HI> He cannot leave the City without the previous Leave of his
Coun|&s;ellors; he is allowed no Marks of Di&s;tinction in his Dre&s;s or
Equipage when he makes pri|vate Vi&s;its, or leaves the City, except that his
Family are &s;uffered to u&s;e Gold or Silver Lace on their Liveries, and in
the Ornaments of their Box at the Theatre; and the Ladies wear rich coloured
Cloaths at public Fe&s;tivals, when the <HI>Pragmatica</HI> obliges the other
noble <HI>Venetians</HI> to appear in black. Upon public Occa&s;ions, his
Serenity generally wears a Ve&s;t and Ducal Mantle of Brocade of Gold or
Silver, lined with Ermine, a Cap of Crim&s;on Velvet, with a Border of Gold, to
repre&s;ent the Diadem, and under it a &s;hort Hood of Gauze, and Shoes of
Crim&s;on Dama&s;k. The Sword of State is carried after the Prince, and 
<PB N="251" REF="258"> at the Head of the Seignory, to &s;hew where the real
Power is lodged. A folding Chair, with a gilt Frame, and a Seat of Brocade,
with a Stool of the &s;ame to &s;et his Foot on, and a large Pari&s;ole of Gold
Stuff, are car|ried with the Doge in all public Proce&s;&s;ions, and they
pretend that this Regalia was pre|&s;ented to the famous SEBASTIAN ZIANI by
Pope ALEXANDER the Third, in acknowledg|ment of the Protection he received from
the Republic, when oppre&s;&s;ed by the Emperor FREDERICK the Second. The Doge
has the Title of Serenity and Serene Prince, but to &s;hew that they are not
attached to his Per&s;on alone, Amba&s;&s;adors u&s;e them in his Ab&s;ence in
addre&s;&s;ing the College. Though all Di&s;|patches are written in the Name of
the Prince, and the An&s;wers addre&s;&s;ed to him, yet he can|not open them
without the Members of the Col|lege being pre&s;ent, whereas they can open, and
even an&s;wer them, without his being pre&s;ent; and to &s;hew that his Power
and Influence is merely imaginary, the Senate neither propo&s;e any
Que&s;|tion, or take any Re&s;olution, till he and his Coun&s;ellors are
withdrawn; they then examine the Affairs under Debate, take the Advice of 
<PB N="252" REF="259"> the Savi, and prepare their Deliberations in Writing, to
be carried to the fir&s;t Meeting of the Senate, where the Doge and his
Coun|&s;ellors are pre&s;ent, who have a Voice to ap|prove or di&s;approve in
common with the other Senators. The <HI>Venetian</HI> Money bears the Name of
the Doge, and was formerly &s;tamped as his Coin, when the Power of the Prince
was ab&s;olute; at pre&s;ent is &s;ub&s;tituted the Figure of a Man in the
Ducal Habit on his Knees before St. <HI>Mark,</HI> to &s;hew that the Doge is
&s;ubject to the Republic, of which St. <HI>Mark</HI> is the Hieroglyphic. The
Income of the Prince is fourteen thou&s;and Ducats <HI>per Annum,</HI> (which
amounts to about two thou&s;and Pounds &s;ter|ling) to maintain his Family, and
to defray the Expence of treating the Seignory four Times a Year. The foreign
Amba&s;&s;adors, who have made their public Entry, have a Right to be at
the&s;e Fea&s;ts. The Republic pay all the Officers who attend the Prince on
public Occa&s;ions: he has the Power of &s;elling the dif|ferent Employments of
the Palace, in which, and collating the Benefices of St. <HI>Mark,</HI>
con|&s;i&s;t the principal Emoluments of his Dignity.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="260">When the Doge dies, his Body is embalmed, and
expo&s;ed for three Days on a Bed of State, in an Apartment of the Palace
de&s;tined for that Purpo&s;e. This Expo&s;ition is not only to give the People
an Opportunity to pay the la&s;t Honours to their Prince, but al&s;o to give
the Senate Time to receive any Complaints again&s;t his Admini&s;tration, and
to give his Creditors Lei&s;ure to make their Demands on his Heirs, which if
they refu&s;e to &s;atisfy, he is deprived of funeral Honours at the Ex|pence
of the Republic: for this Rea&s;on, on the Death of a Doge, three Inqui&s;itors
are appointed to &s;earch into his pa&s;t Conduct, to hear all Complaints, and
to &s;atisfy all Demands at the Expence of the Succe&s;&s;ion. The No|bles who
a&s;&s;i&s;t at the Funeral, are dre&s;&s;ed in Scarlet Robes, to &s;hew that
it is not the Go|vernment of the Prince that cau&s;es the Hap|pine&s;s of the
State, and that the Republic being free, ought not to &s;hew any Marks of
Affliction at his Death. The Ob&s;equies are no &s;ooner over, than all the
Nobles, who are more than thirty Years of Age, a&s;&s;emble in the great
Council-Chamber, and elect five Cor|rectors, <PB N="254" REF="261"> who
in&s;pect the Book of Statutes that the Doge, on his Election, &s;wears to
ob&s;erve. The&s;e five Noblemen have a Right to add to, or to retrench from
the&s;e Statutes, what|ever they think nece&s;&s;ary for the Good of the State.
The Ballotation upon this Occa&s;ion is managed with &s;o much Caution, that it
is im|po&s;&s;ible for any Thing but Chance to decide which &s;hall be the
forty-one Senators cho&s;e out of the whole Number to elect a Succe&s;&s;or to
the decea&s;ed Prince. When the&s;e Electors have been approved by the general
Council, they are &s;hut up in the Palace of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> and not
&s;uffered to &s;tir out until the Election is over; twenty-five of the
forty-one Voices mu&s;t be in Favour of the Per&s;on that is cho&s;en. The
fir&s;t Thing required of the Doge is, to &s;wear to the Ob&s;ervance of the
Book of Sta|tutes. He then &s;hews him&s;elf to the People, and in going out of
the Palace for that Pur|po&s;e, pa&s;&s;es through the Chamber in which his
Body is to be expo&s;ed after his Death, and <HI>there</HI> he receives from
the Grand Chancellor the fir&s;t Compliments on his new Dignity. He then gets
into a Machine, not unlike a great Tub, and two hundred Men, who belong to 
<PB N="255" REF="262"> the Ar&s;enal, carry him by Turns round the Place of St.
<HI>Mark</HI> on their Shoulders. The Doge thus &s;eated, one of his Children,
or &s;ome near Relation, &s;tands behind him, holding two Ba&s;ons filled with
Money, which he di&s;tributes among the Populace.</P>
<P>Having killed one Prince, and proclaimed another, I think I may
decently take my Leave for the pre&s;ent; and &s;hould you be as tired with
reading, as I am with writing, you will wi&s;h you had never heard of his
Serenity. I hope you will think my next more intere&s;ting, which will treat of
the different Councils of <HI>Venice.</HI></P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXI. Mi&s;s N&mdash; to Mr. HULL.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Venice,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>April</HI> 12, 1766.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING in my la&s;t di&s;patched his Sere|nity the Doge, I now
proceed with Ala|crity to give you an Account of the Coun|cils, of which,
according to AMELOT DE LA HOUSSAIE, there are three principal; the great one,
which comprehends all the Nobility; the College, which gives Audience to
Am|ba&s;&s;adors; and the Pregadi, which is the Se|nate. The Great-Council
meets every <HI>Sunday</HI> and Holiday to chu&s;e Magi&s;trates, which is done
by Ballotation. The Nobles have no Right to enter into it, until they are
twenty-five Years old, but the Seignory di&s;pen&s;e &s;ome|times with their
being under Age. This A&s;|&s;embly has a Right of confirming or annulling the
Decrees of the Senate, and to make or repeal Laws. The mo&s;t remarkable
&s;tanding Laws are the&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> that all Eccle&s;ia&s;tics are 
<PB N="257" REF="264"> excluded from every civil Employment and public
A&s;&s;embly. The Nobles cannot arrive at the principal Offices, but by
Gradation; nor can they hold more than one Office at once, be it ever &s;o
&s;mall. Tho&s;e who refu&s;e any Employment, are fined two thou&s;and Du|cats,
and bani&s;hed for two Years from the Great Council and Broglio; (this Name
they give to an Apartment under the <HI>Procuratia Nuova,</HI> where the
Noblemen meet in a Mor|ning, and tho&s;e who are trying to attain any Place in
the Government, u&s;e this Opportu|nity to &s;olicit the Votes of their Friends
for their Ballotation in the Great Council.) No Magi&s;trate can re&s;ign, or
leave the City. All the Sons of the Nobility have equal Portions: if a Daughter
has more than five thou&s;and Ducats, (about &s;ix hundred Pounds &s;terling)
&s;he receives the Income of the Overplus for her own &s;eparate U&s;e, and if
&s;he dies without Chil|dren, it returns to her Family. All Subjects of the
Republic (the Doge not excepted) pay Taxes in Proportion to their Fortune. The
Magi&s;trates in civil Cau&s;es can receive no Vi|&s;its or Recommendation of
the Parties, but may in criminal ones, if they are not State 
<PB N="258" REF="265"> Affairs. No Nobleman can enter into Trade. The Great
Council corrects all public Errors, and redre&s;&s;es all Grievances impo&s;ed
by tho&s;e who u&s;e their Authority unlawfully, &s;o that this may be called
the fir&s;t Tribunal, and the Ba&s;is, as well as Support of the Republic.</P>
<P>To gratify the young Nobility, they admit thirty by Lot every Year
into the Great Coun|cil, who are only twenty Years of Age, and allow them the
&s;ame Privileges as tho&s;e who are twenty-five; the&s;e young ones are called
<HI>Barbarini,</HI> becau&s;e they are cho&s;en on the Day of St. BARBARA. This
A&s;&s;embly &s;its from eight in the Morning until Noon; it is held in the
large&s;t Room of the Palace: at the upper End are rai&s;ed Seats, on which the
Doge and his Coun&s;ellors are placed. The Chief of the Council of Ten, the
Avoga|dores and the Cen&s;ors are &s;eated round the Hall, upon rai&s;ed
Benches. The Coun&s;ellors of the Doge can convoke, at Plea&s;ure, the Great
Council, and for this Purpo&s;e they cau&s;e the Bells of the principal
Churches in the &s;ix Quar|ters of the Town to be rung, and at this Sig|nal,
the Nobles attend the Council without <PB N="259" REF="266"> Arms, which they
are forbid to carry there on Pain of Death.</P>
<P>When AMELOT DE LA HOUSSAIE wrote his Hi&s;tory of the Republic of
<HI>Venice,</HI> the No|bles were computed at five and twenty Hun|dred; but
they now fall very &s;hort of that Calculation. The Great Council u&s;ually
con|&s;i&s;ts of about eight hundred, and nearly the &s;ame Number is
&s;uppo&s;ed to be employed in the Provinces, on Emba&s;&s;ies, and other
public Services; or, for private Rea&s;ons, are not in a Situation to attend in
Council.</P>
<P>THE COLLEGE.</P>
<P>THE College is formed of twenty-&s;ix Mem|bers, <HI>viz.</HI> The
Doge and his &s;ix Coun&s;ellors, three of the <HI>Quarantia Criminale,</HI>
(who are changed every two Months) &s;ix <HI>Savi Grandi,</HI> five of the
<HI>Savi</HI> of the <HI>Terra Firma,</HI> and the five <HI>Savi</HI> of Order.
The College has the Right of a&s;&s;embling the Senate, and propo|&s;ing what
is to be debated therein; but yet they mu&s;t obey its Re&s;olutions, and act
in <PB N="260" REF="267"> Concert with it. At this Tribunal the Maje|&s;ty of
the Prince may be &s;aid to re&s;ide, for here the Amba&s;&s;adors have their
Audience, all Letters upon foreign Affairs are read, all Me|morials are
pre&s;ented, and all Privileges, in Regard to Benefices, Prelates, <HI>&amp;c.
&amp;c.</HI> are pleaded. In &s;hort, this is the Committee of Ways and Means,
where all Bu&s;ine&s;s is fir&s;t planned, in order to be laid before the
Senate for their Concurrence.</P>
<P>THE SENATE.</P>
<P>THE Senate had formerly the Name of <HI>Pregadi</HI> given to it,
becau&s;e it then never a&s;|&s;embled but upon extraordinary Occa&s;ions; and
the Magi&s;trates were obliged to reque&s;t the Attendance of the principal
Citizens, when any important Affair required their Advice. This A&s;&s;embly
now meets every <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> and <HI>Fri|day,</HI> and, upon an
Emergency, the <HI>Savi</HI> for the Week can call an extraordinary
<HI>Pregadi.</HI> This Tribunal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all the Authority of the
Republic, for here all Re&s;olutions con|cerning Peace and War are taken, all
Leagues <PB N="261" REF="268"> and Alliances are made, Amba&s;&s;adors and
al&s;o Officers who have con&s;iderable Rank in the Army are nominated, and all
Taxes are impo&s;ed according to the Exigency of Affairs. The Con&s;ultations
of the College are here examin|ed and determined by a Plurality of Voices. This
In&s;titution in its Commencement was only compo&s;ed of &s;ixty Senators,
called an <HI>ordinary Pregadi</HI>; but being often obliged, in Ca&s;es of
Importance, to add to the Number, &s;ixty more were created, called the
<HI>Junto:</HI> the&s;e hundred and twenty Senators are always No|blemen of
advanced Age and approved Merit. The Members of the College, the Council of
Ten, the <HI>Quarantia Criminale,</HI> the Procurators of St. <HI>Mark,</HI>
with mo&s;t Part of the Magi|&s;trates, enter al&s;o into the <HI>Pregadi,</HI>
&s;o that it now con&s;i&s;ts of near three hundred Members, one Part whereof
have a Right to vote, the re&s;t can only hearken and learn the Rules of
Government. The Doge and his Coun&s;ellors are the only Per&s;ons who&s;e
Advice can be bal|lotted, to prevent the Confu&s;ion that would probably
ari&s;e from a Diver&s;ity of Opinions, as half the Votes mu&s;t be in Favour
of the Que&s;|tion before it can pa&s;s. Tho&s;e who have no 
<PB N="262" REF="269"> Right to vote, may harangue and contradict the Opinions
propo&s;ed. The hundred and twenty, who compo&s;e the ordinary <HI>Pregadi</HI>
and <HI>Junto,</HI> are ballotted every Year in the Great Council, to be
changed or continued, as &s;hall be de|termined in the &s;aid Council. The
Senate is particularly attentive in maintaining Harmony among the Nobles; well
knowing, that a con|trary Behaviour might be productive of fatal Con&s;equences
to the Liberty of the Country, as was formerly the Ca&s;e with
<HI>Florence</HI> and <HI>Verona.</HI></P>
<P>The COUNSELLORS of the DOGE.</P>
<P>THE Coun&s;ellors of the Doge (or more pro|perly of the Signory) are
&s;ix in Number, they are cho&s;en from among&s;t the olde&s;t Senators of the
fir&s;t Rank; though they are Coun&s;el|lors for a Year, they only a&s;&s;i&s;t
in the Col|lege eight Months; the other four Months they pre&s;ide in the
<HI>Quarantia Criminale,</HI> in the &s;ame Manner as the Chiefs of that
Chamber have places in the College during two Months. The&s;e &s;ix
Coun&s;ellors have more Power than the Doge; <PB N="263" REF="270"> their
Employment is two-fold: fir&s;t, they are obliged to con&s;ult with the Doge
upon all Matters that are to be propo&s;ed in the Coun|cils, to open all
Letters directed to the Sig|nory, to receive Petitions, and to appoint Judges
to &s;ettle any Di&s;pute which may ari&s;e about Juri&s;diction; and
&s;econdly, to pre&s;ide at all Councils, and, during an <HI>Interregnum,</HI>
to di&s;|patch Orders to all the Officers of the State. When the Doge is ill,
the mo&s;t antient of the Coun&s;ellors repre&s;ent him in the College, and at
all public Functions: but he is nei|ther allowed to &s;it in the ducal Chair,
or wear the Habit of the Prince, and is only di&s;tingui&s;hed by a Cap which
he never takes off, no more than the Doge does his ducal Crown. The
Coun&s;ellors, whil&s;t in Office, wear &s;carlet Gowns.</P>
<P>As I &s;hall, in my next, introduce you to a Tribunal &s;o awful,
that the bare Name makes thou&s;ands tremble, I &s;hall allow my&s;elf &s;ome
Re&s;pite for the pre&s;ent, and endeavour to lo&s;e the Idea of the&s;e dry
intricate Subjects in the more plea&s;ing ones of <HI>Virt&ugrave;.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="271">You will excu&s;e my breaking off thus, when I
tell you, that my Gondola now waits to carry me to a <HI>dilletanti</HI> Party,
with whom I am going to examine the famous Marriage of PAOLO VERONESE, at the
Convent of St. <HI>George.</HI> It &s;o rarely happens, that our Plea|&s;ures
in the Enjoyment equal the Vivacity of our Expectation, I almo&s;t fear I
promi&s;e my&s;elf too much on this Occa&s;ion; but if this celebrated Piece
de&s;erves half the Encomiums that are be&s;towed upon it, my Delight will be
exqui|&s;ite: I heartily wi&s;h you could be a Partaker of it.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXII. Mi&s;s N&mdash; to Mr. HULL.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>April</HI> 15,
1766.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Promi&s;ed, in my la&s;t, to introduce you to the mo&s;t
tremendous Tribunal, that, per|haps, ever poor Culprits trembled before, if we
view it in its original State: but I think all the &s;en&s;ible People, I have
conver&s;ed with in <HI>Venice,</HI> agree, that it is &s;omewhat relaxed, from
its primitive Severity, though &s;till to be dreaded for the Extent of Power,
the Inqui|&s;itors of State are entru&s;ted with.</P>
<P>The INQUISITION.</P>
<P>THIS Tribunal is compo&s;ed of two of the Council of Ten, and one of
the Coun&s;ellors of the Doge. As the Affairs, that fall under the Cognizance
thereof are of the utmo&s;t Con&s;e|quence to the State, depending chiefly upon
cer|tain Intelligences collected by Spies, &s;o all their Proceedings are
managed with the deepe&s;t Se|crecy; and, in &s;ome Ca&s;es, they are obliged 
<PB N="266" REF="273"> to u&s;e Severity, and to puni&s;h Offenders in a very
exemplary Manner, The Life of the Doge, the Nobles, and all the Subjects of the
State, lie at the Mercy of this Tribunal, pro|vided the three Inqui&s;itors
entirely concur in Opinion; and in this Ca&s;e, they are not obliged to give an
Account of their Actions to any one, or even communicate them to the Coun|cil
of Ten. The Execution of the Sentences pronounced by the&s;e Judges is not
le&s;s &s;e|cret than their Judgments, except when the Crime is of a public
Nature: in private Ca&s;es, to prevent Exclamations again&s;t &s;uch &s;eeming
Severity, as often puni&s;hes with Death an un|guarded Expre&s;&s;ion again&s;t
&s;o rigorous a Go|vernment, (it is &s;aid) they &s;end in the Night, and have
the Offender &s;eized, and pronounce his Doom, without any other Ceremony, than
confronting him with two Witne&s;&s;es, if there are any, or el&s;e, on the
bare Report of Spies. As many Inconveniencies have ari&s;en from this
de&s;potic Method of Proceeding, a Law has been provided, that the
Inqui&s;itors &s;hall not put to Death a noble Venetian, without fir&s;t
hearing his Defence. If a Stranger of any Con&s;equence becomes &s;u&s;pected
by this Tri|bunal, <PB N="267" REF="274"> he mu&s;t expect to lo&s;e his
Papers, and receive an Order, &s;igned by one of the Inqui|&s;itors, requiring
him to leave the State within a limited Time, on Pain of Death. As the
<HI>Venetian</HI> Nobility, of every Cla&s;s, are forbid to hold any Sort of
Corre&s;pondence with Am|ba&s;&s;adors, or foreign Mini&s;ters, or even with
the meane&s;t Per&s;on in their Families, it is for this Intent, that the Spies
of the Inqui&s;itors are particularly vigilant in collecting Matter of
Complaint.</P>
<P>Har&s;h as the Proceedings of this Tribunal mu&s;t appear to
<HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> who are ble&s;&s;ed with the happie&s;t Form of
Government, the &s;en&s;ible and unprejudiced MONTESQUIEU a&s;|&s;erts, that it
has often &s;aved the Republic of <HI>Venice</HI> from total De&s;truction.</P>
<P>The COUNCIL OF TEN.</P>
<P>THIS was orignally, a mere temporary Cham|ber of Ju&s;tice,
appointed to enquire into the famous Con&s;piracy of TIEPOLI: but was &s;oon
after made perpetual, and is now one of the <PB N="268" REF="275"> mo&s;t
re&s;pectable Tribunals of the Republic; it takes Cognizance of all the
criminal Affairs among the Nobility, that happen in the City, or State of
<HI>Venice,</HI> and judges Crimes of <HI>Leze Maje&s;t&eacute;,</HI> and all
other attrocious Offences. This Council has the Care of the public
Tranqui|lity, and their Power is as much to be dreaded by the Nobles, as by the
common People. The Doge and his Coun&s;ellors have a Right to enter this
Chamber of Ju&s;tice; but the ten Senators, of whom it is compo&s;ed, have not
le&s;s Power in the Ab&s;ence of the Doge, than when he is pre&s;ent: they are
cho&s;en out of diffe|rent Families, and are elected in the Great Coun|cil
every Year; they then elect three among them&s;elves to be the Head of the
Councils; the&s;e rule Week about, and are changed every three Months. The
Chief in Office receives all Informations from Spies, and reports them to his
Colleagues, who, upon the Depo&s;ition of Witne&s;&s;es, and the An&s;wers of
the accu&s;ed, proceed again&s;t them before the Council, where the Offender is
not allowed to plead for him|&s;elf per&s;onally, or by Lawyer. The armed
Galley that always lies at St. <HI>Mark</HI>'s Place, and &s;ome Cannon and
Gallies at the Ar&s;enal, <PB N="269" REF="276"> are under the Command of the
Council of Ten. They meet only once a Week, unle&s;s &s;ome Affair of
Importance calls them oftener together.</P>
<P>The <HI>QUARANTIA CRIMINALE.</HI></P>
<P>THERE are three Courts of Ju&s;tice, that con|&s;i&s;t each of forty
Judges; the fir&s;t of the&s;e is the mo&s;t antient Tribunal of the Republic,
but it has &s;uffered a great Diminution of Power by the E&s;tabli&s;hment of
the Council of Ten. The forty Judges of the upper Chamber have a Right to vote
in the Senate; and the three Chiefs, who are Pre&s;idents, have likewi&s;e
Seats in the College, during the two la&s;t Months they are in Office; and
three of the Coun&s;ellors of the Doge pre&s;ide in the <HI>Quarantia
Criminale,</HI> the four la&s;t Months of their Year, to &s;hew the Connexion
there is between this Chamber and the College. This Office is generally filled
by Noblemen who are not rich; they receive thirty Ducats <HI>per</HI> Month by
it, and acquire Con&s;i|deration among the Nobility. To arrive at this Chamber,
they mu&s;t pa&s;s through the <PB N="270" REF="277"> other <HI>Quarantias</HI>
fir&s;t, which are much infe|rior in Authority. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are
many other lower Courts of Ju&s;tice that take Cognizance of mercantile
Affairs, Bankrupt|cies, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> It is worthy of Ob&s;ervation,
in this wi&s;e and intricate Government, how all the &s;uperior Tribunals are
interwoven with, and, if I may u&s;e the Expre&s;&s;ion, germinate from, each
other.</P>
<P><HI>SAVI GRANDI.</HI></P>
<P>THESE Magi&s;trates are &s;ix in Number; they are cho&s;en from
among the wi&s;e&s;t of the Senators, and, during the Time they are in office,
manage all political Affairs of Impor|tance, and are, properly &s;peaking,
prime Mi|ni&s;ters: they are elected by the Senate, and changed every &s;ix
Months, three at a Time, by which Means, there remain three old Se|nators in
Office, who are able to inform the new elected ones, of what happened during
their Admini&s;tration, and &s;erves as a model for the future Conduct of the
new Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="278"><HI>SAVI</HI> of the <HI>TERRA FIRMA.</HI></P>
<P>THESE five Officers of the State have little le&s;s Authority in the
College than the <HI>Savi Grandi</HI>; they are the &s;ame Length of Time in
Office, are cho&s;en of a le&s;s advanced Age, and are preferred according to
their Applica|tion, and the Abilities they have &s;hewn in the Offices they
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have pa&s;&s;ed through to arrive at this. The fir&s;t,
or <HI>Savi Ca&s;hier,</HI> is Pay-Ma&s;ter; the &s;econd, <HI>Savi degli
Scritura,</HI> Se|cretary at War, and the third, <HI>Savi</HI> of the
Or|dinance, has the Direction of the Military of the <HI>Terra Firma</HI>; the
other two are only to a&s;&s;i&s;t the three fir&s;t. They are elected by the
Senate, as the <HI>Savi Grandi,</HI> and have a Right to vote on every Motion,
which may be pro|po&s;ed by them; but, to pre&s;erve a Subordina|tion between
the two Offices, have no Right to vote in the Senate.</P>
<P><HI>SAVI</HI> of ORDER.</P>
<P>THIS Magi&s;tracy is the &s;ame in Number as the <HI>Savi</HI> of
the <HI>Terra Firma,</HI> but is with|out <PB N="272" REF="279">
Juri&s;diction, and is only a School, as it were, wherein the young Nobility
may learn the Art of Government. The&s;e Noblemen, during the &s;ix Months they
are in Office, a&s;&s;i&s;t at all the Con&s;ultations of the College, and
con&s;e|quently have a Share in the Secrets of State; they have no Right to
vote either in the Col|lege or Senate, but may give their Opinion at the
Con&s;ultations of the <HI>Savi,</HI> always &s;peak|ing uncovered and
&s;tanding. They are allowed to &s;ee all the Di&s;patches that are &s;ent to
Am|ba&s;&s;adors, and the Regi&s;ters of the Affairs of State. This Employment
is looked upon by the Republic, as the Touch&s;tone of the Cha|racter and
Genius of their young Nobility.</P>
<P>PROCURATORS of ST. <HI>MARK.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Honour is generally be&s;towed on &s;uch of the Nobility who
have been of e&s;&s;ential Ser|vice to their Country in expen&s;ive
Emba&s;&s;ies, in a naval Command, or for having gone through the mo&s;t
important Employments of the State with Honour and Integrity. The Procurators
take Place of all the other Nobi|lity; <PB N="273" REF="280"> they have the
Di&s;po&s;al of all pious Le|gacies, are the Guardians of Orphans, and
Protectors of Widows. The Number was for|merly confined to nine, but is now
encrea&s;ed to eleven. In pre&s;&s;ing Nece&s;&s;ities of the Re|public, this
Dignity has been &s;old for immen&s;e Sums; but, except in Ca&s;es of public
Di&s;tre&s;s, it can only be di&s;po&s;ed of by Merit; and tho&s;e who
purcha&s;e it never have any Succe&s;|&s;ors appointed when they die. Their
Dre&s;s is a purple Robe. The magnificent Buildings on each Side of St.
<HI>Mark</HI>'s Place, were ori|ginally de&s;tined for the Habitation of the
Pro|curators, and from thence called <HI>Procuratias</HI>; but they are now
chiefly rented to Strangers and foreign Mini&s;ters, by Way of
<HI>Ca&s;inos.</HI></P>
<P>The GRAND CHANCELLOR.</P>
<P>THIS Dignity can only be enjoyed by a Per&s;on of the Rank of
Citizen; he takes Place of all the other Magi&s;trates, and wears a pur|ple
Robe, like the Procurators of St. <HI>Mark.</HI> All the Councils are open to
him; he holds the Seal of the Republic, and a&s;&s;i&s;ts at read|ing 
<PB N="274" REF="281"> and an&s;wering the Di&s;patches from Am|ba&s;&s;adors,
and every Thing el&s;e material that is treated of in the Senate. He has the
Ti|tle of <HI>Excellenza,</HI> and is the Head of the Peo|ple, as the Doge is
of the Nobility. His In|come is about nine thou&s;and Ducats <HI>per
An|num.</HI> He is buried with great Pomp, at the Expence of the Republic.</P>
<P>The <HI>AVOGADORES.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Office re&s;embles, in Part, that of Attorney-General in
<HI>England,</HI> but is divided among three People; the greate&s;t In&s;tance
of its Power is, being able, for the Space of three Days, to &s;u&s;pend the
Judgment of all the other Courts of Ju&s;tice, when the Crime is not clearly
proved upon the Culprit. In this Particular, the <HI>Avogador</HI> re&s;embles
the <HI>Ro|man</HI> Tribunes of the People. They are elected by the Senate, but
the Choice mu&s;t be con|firmed by the Grand Council, where all Pro|ceedings
would be null, if one of the <HI>Avo|gadores</HI> did not a&s;&s;i&s;t. Their
Dre&s;s, when in Office, is a purple Robe.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="282">The TWO CENSORS.</P>
<P>THE Juri&s;diction of the Cen&s;ors extends principally to the
Manners of particular Per|&s;ons; to the Intrigues of the Nobles in the
<HI>Broglio</HI>; to the Condemnation and Fining of tho&s;e who violate the
Statutes of the Great Council; to the Payment of Wages, Pilfering of Servants,
and Correction of <HI>Gondaliers.</HI> They are &s;ixteen Months in Office;
during which Term, they have a Right to vote in the <HI>Pre|gadi,</HI> and wear
purple Gowns.</P>
<P>I have extended this beyond the common Bounds of a Letter, and find
that by &s;o doing, I have lo&s;t Half an Hour of an agreeable Conver&s;ation,

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Venice,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>April</HI> 19, 1766.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WITH your Leave, my good Friend, I am going to engage you in a
little Trip to the <HI>Terra Firma,</HI> in Order to intro|duce you to the
<HI>Pode&s;t&agrave;s</HI> and <HI>Capitanios,</HI> a Set of Gentlemen of no
&s;mall Con&s;equence, I a&s;|&s;ure you, in their re&s;pective
Governments.</P>
<P>To the greater Towns of the <HI>Terra Firma,</HI> the Senate &s;end
two Noblemen, with the Ti|tles of <HI>Pode&s;t&agrave;</HI> and
<HI>Capitanio</HI>; the&s;e equally re|pre&s;ent the Republic, the fir&s;t in
the Admi|ni&s;tration <PB N="277" REF="284"> of civil Ju&s;tice, the &s;econd
in the Command of Military Affairs. The <HI>Pode&s;t&agrave;</HI> is the
principal Per&s;on, as he takes Cognizance of all that regards the Police, and
the good Order of the People. The <HI>Capitanio,</HI> be&s;ides the Command of
the Troops, has Power to puni&s;h the Inhabitants for any Crime com|mitted in
the Streets, during the Cour&s;e of the Night. He has al&s;o the Care of the
public Money, which is collected by Receivers, who are accountable to him for
it. The <HI>Pode&s;t&agrave;s</HI> and <HI>Capitanios</HI> are obliged to
report to the Senate every Mea&s;ure they take. To the Ca|pitals of Provinces
are generally &s;ent both the above-mentioned Officers; but in Towns of &s;mall
Importance, the two Offices are united in the Per&s;on of the
<HI>Pode&s;t&agrave;,</HI> who holds his Employment &s;ixteen Months. The
Appoint|ments allowed them by the Republic are very &s;mall, in Compari&s;on to
what they are obli|ged to &s;pend in the Capitals, therefore to them the Senate
generally &s;ends rich Noblemen, and poor ones to the &s;mall Towns, where, not
being obliged to make an expen&s;ive Appear|ance, they may, if they plea&s;e,
gain a com|fortable <PB N="278" REF="285"> Sub&s;i&s;tence by their Po&s;t,
during the Time they are employed in it.</P>
<P>A Nobleman of the fir&s;t Rank is always &s;ent into the
<HI>Frioul,</HI> with the Title of <HI>Provedi|tore-General</HI> of <HI>Palma
Nova</HI>; this Place is of great Con&s;equence to the <HI>Venetians,</HI> as
it &s;erves for a Frontier to the Emperor's Dominions, and is a &s;trong
Barrier again&s;t the Incur&s;ions of the <HI>Turks.</HI> At <HI>Udeney,</HI>
where the Patriarch of <HI>Aqui|lia</HI> re&s;ides, the Republic employs only a
Lieu|tenant and &s;ome Subalterns. In <HI>I&s;tria</HI> are four epi&s;copal
Towns, with five others not &s;o con|&s;iderable, each of them governed by a
<HI>Pode&s;t&agrave;.</HI> The Commanding-Officers of the&s;e Places, as well
as tho&s;e of the <HI>Levant</HI> and <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> are changed only once
in two Years. The Senate gives the Title of Counts, Governors, and Captains, to
the Noblemen who are &s;ent into <HI>Dalmatia</HI> to admini&s;ter Ju&s;tice.
The Ma|gi&s;trates of the principal Towns, (for Exam|ple, the Counts of
<HI>Spalatro</HI> and <HI>Gara,</HI> who are likewi&s;e Archbi&s;hops) have
appointed to them a Council of three noble <HI>Venetians,</HI> with|out whom
they cannot determine on any Thing; but all the&s;e Officers are &s;ubject to
the <HI>Prove|ditore-General,</HI> <PB N="279" REF="286"> who has full
Authority in all Affairs civil and military. The I&s;les of <HI>Cor|fuzant</HI>
and <HI>Cephalonia,</HI> are each governed by a <HI>Proveditore,</HI>
a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a Council of three noble <HI>Venetians. Corfu</HI> is a Place
of great Importance, as it commands the Entrance of the Gulph, and is the
Repo&s;itory of the <HI>Ve|netian</HI> Merchandize brought from the
<HI>Levant</HI>; this Place is regarded by the <HI>Turks</HI> with a jealous
Eye. There is al&s;o a General of the&s;e three I&s;les, to whom the particular
<HI>Proveditores</HI> render Obedience, as the Magi&s;trates of the Towns in
<HI>Dalmatia</HI> do to the <HI>Proveditore-Ge|neral.</HI></P>
<P>INQUISITORS of the <HI>TERRA FIRMA.</HI></P>
<P>EVERY five Years, Inqui&s;itors are &s;ent to hold Courts in the
&s;everal Provinces of the <HI>Terra Firma</HI>; their Bu&s;ine&s;s is to
in&s;pect into the Conduct of <HI>Pode&s;t&agrave;s</HI> and
<HI>Capitanios,</HI> and to receive all Complaints of Mal-admini&s;tra|tion of
Ju&s;tice. Their Cen&s;ures are &s;eldom &s;evere, but when there are Proofs of
Embez|zlement of the public Money, and in that <PB N="280" REF="287"> Ca&s;e,
their Office obliges them to act with the utmo&s;t Rigour. They are attended by
a Com|pany of Cavalry, and an Executioner, that they may puni&s;h on the Spot
all Offences that are clearly proved. This gives the Provin|cials a very high
Idea of the Ju&s;tice of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Government.</P>
<P>The MAGISTRATES of POMP.</P>
<P><HI>Gli Sopre Proveditore alle Pompe,</HI> are Sena|tors, who by
&s;trict Ordinances &s;uppre&s;s all out|ward Marks of Luxury, and pre&s;erve
an exact Equality, in the exterior Appearance of the Nobility. At public
Fea&s;ts, the Dre&s;s of the Ladies is always black, except on &s;ome
Oc|ca&s;ions, when they are allowed to wear a rich gold or &s;ilver Stuff
Petticoat with their black Gowns. The noble <HI>Venetians</HI> are not
&s;uffered to u&s;e gold or &s;ilver Lace on their Boatmen's Liveries, or in
their Boxes at the Theatres, except the Doge's Family and the Grand
Chan|cellor's. In Ma&s;king-Time, the Ladies may wear rich coloured Cloaths,
which is about &s;ix Months in the Year; and when they are 
<PB N="281" REF="288"> at their E&s;tates on the <HI>Terra Firma,</HI> they may
give as rich Liveries as they choo&s;e, but the Servants who wear them never
attend them at <HI>Venice,</HI> but in their own Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>REVENUES and EXPENCES of the STATE.</P>
<P>THE &s;ettled Revenue of the Republic is &s;uppo&s;ed, at pre&s;ent,
according to the be&s;t Cal|culation, to amount to about a Million and a Half
&s;terling <HI>per Annum</HI>; this is rai&s;ed by Imports and Exports, and
Taxes upon all the Provi&s;ions con&s;umed in the City of <HI>Ve|nice,</HI> and
upon all Sorts of Merchandizes, and by other Duties rai&s;ed in the I&s;les of
the <HI>La|gunes,</HI> and upon all the E&s;tates &s;ituated near
<HI>Venice,</HI> called the <HI>Dogado</HI> or Dutchy. Another Part of the
Revenue is rai&s;ed in the &s;ame Manner from the Towns and Provinces of the
<HI>Terra Firma,</HI> and al&s;o from <HI>I&s;tria, Dalma|tia,</HI> and the
I&s;les of <HI>Corfu, Zant,</HI> and <HI>Cepha|lonia.</HI> A large Portion
likewi&s;e ari&s;es from the Salt made at <HI>Corfu</HI> and <HI>Chio&s;a</HI>;
and to this may be added, twenty thou&s;and Ducats <HI>per</HI> 
<PB N="282" REF="289"> Month, that are paid into the Coffers of the Republic
from a Lottery, on the &s;ame Plan as tho&s;e of <HI>Rome</HI> and
<HI>Naples,</HI> which has been e&s;tabli&s;hed within the&s;e thirty Years. In
Time of War, the Senate finds great Re&s;ources by ennobling rich Families,
making &s;upernumerary Procurators of St. <HI>Mark</HI>; by renewing old Taxes,
and impo&s;ing new ones. The yearly Expences of Government do not require above
half the Income of the State, &s;o that in Time of Peace the Republic can lay
up va&s;t Sums; by which Means, the <HI>Venetians</HI> are enabled to negotiate
all their Affairs with foreign Powers by the Force of Money in&s;tead of
Arms.</P>
<P>The FORCES of the REPUBLIC.</P>
<P>IN Time of Peace, the <HI>Venetians</HI> are &s;up|po&s;ed to pay
about twenty-five thou&s;and Men; but there is &s;trong Rea&s;on to believe,
that not above one third of them are effective, owing to the Abu&s;es of the
<HI>Proveditores</HI> in <HI>Dalmatia.</HI> The Infantry are chiefly
<HI>Sclavonians, Morlaques,</HI> and <HI>Albanians</HI>; they are e&s;teemed
brave Soldiers, and are firmly attached to the <PB N="283" REF="290">
<HI>Venetians,</HI> from an inveterate Hatred to the <HI>Turks,</HI> who are
their natural Enemies. The Cavalry are partly compo&s;ed of the &s;ame
Na|tions, and partly of <HI>Ultramontanes.</HI> The Ge|neral in Chief mu&s;t
always be a Foreigner, and his Power is &s;o over-ruled by the
<HI>Pro|veditore-General,</HI> that he has only the Name of Commander of the
Forces. The chief At|tention of the Senate is paid to the Marine. They have no
regular naval Force in Time of Peace; but upon an Emergency, can arm thirty
Galleys, able to act again&s;t their Ene|mies, in a very expeditious Manner.
They always keep &s;ome Galleys in the <HI>Levant,</HI> with other Ve&s;&s;els,
to guard the Provinces &s;ituated near the Sea; the&s;e are under the Command
of the <HI>Proveditore-General.</HI> A Squadron of &s;ix Gal|leys, and
&s;everal other Ve&s;&s;els, are likewi&s;e em|ployed to cruize about the Mouth
of the Gulph, to &s;ecure the Traders from the Cor&s;airs, and to make the
Merchants pay their proper Du|ties. The Nobleman who commands this Squa|dron
has the Title of General of the Gulph, his Command continues for three Years.
The Republic, in Peace as well as in War, creates a <HI>Proveditore
General,</HI> who commands both the <PB N="284" REF="291"> Fleet and Army; he
has an ab&s;olute Power to puni&s;h with Death all Officers, Soldiers, and
Sailors, and to di&s;po&s;e of all Po&s;ts in the Army and Navy; he re&s;ides
at <HI>Corfu</HI> the fir&s;t three Years he is in Office, and when that Time
is expired, he is obliged to render an Account of his Admini&s;tration to the
Senate.</P>
<P>SPIES and INFORMERS.</P>
<P>SPIES have ever been looked upon as in|famous Mini&s;ters of
Tyranny; but the Senate of <HI>Venice</HI> have found Means to conceal the
Shame of &s;uch Mi&s;creants, by making Mouths of Stone &s;peak for them; for
in many Parts of the Palace of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> and in all the Parts of the
City near the public Tribunals, Heads are cut in the Walls with gaping Mouths,
into which they ca&s;t the Notes of Information. If the Informer has no Scruple
to declare him|&s;elf, he goes in Per&s;on to receive the Reward allowed by Law
on this Occa&s;ion; if he does not choo&s;e to be known, he &s;ends a Friend,
with a Piece of Paper that has been torn from that on which the Information was
written, <PB N="285" REF="292"> and the Money is paid without any other
For|mality than comparing the two Pieces of Pa|per together. As the great Maxim
of the <HI>Ve|netians</HI> is, that the Safety of the State depends upon their
having exact Intelligence of every Thing that pa&s;&s;es, e&s;pecially in the
Families of Amba&s;&s;adors and foreign Mini&s;ters, it is in|credible what a
Number of Spies of all Ranks they keep in con&s;tant Pay. That the
<HI>Vene|tians</HI> are often branded with the ridiculous Epithet of
Pantaloons, for this apparent My|&s;teriou&s;ne&s;s in their Sy&s;tem of
Politics, we very well know; but how far they are right or wrong in it, I leave
to better Judgments than mine to determine: this however we mu&s;t allow, that
their Government has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted under a re|publican Form, without any
material Alteration, for a much longer Period of Time than any other Republic
that Hi&s;tory furni&s;hes us with an Account of, at lea&s;t that I can
recollect. I had a great Curio&s;ity, when I came to <HI>Ve|nice,</HI> to learn
the Etymology of the Name of <HI>Pantaloon,</HI> and why it is &s;o
particularly applied to the <HI>Venetians</HI>; I am told it comes from
<HI>Pianta Leone,</HI> and was fir&s;t appropriated to them for their great
Eagerne&s;s to plant the <PB N="286" REF="293"> Standard of <HI>Venice,</HI>
which you know is a Lion, wherever they could by Force or Fraud ob|tain a Bit
of Ground large enough to con|tain it. How far this etymological Account of
hone&s;t <HI>Pantaloon</HI> may &s;atisfy you, I know not; but, remember, I do
not vouch for the Reality of it, I only offer it to you as I have received it.
I propo&s;e by the next Po&s;t to &s;end you a &s;uccinct Account of the
Me|thod of proceeding at <HI>Venice</HI> in criminal Ca&s;es, and am, in the
mean Time,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Venice,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>May</HI> 1, 1766.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AN agreeable Excur&s;ion for a few Days into the Country has
prevented my being &s;o punctual in my literary Engagement as I have hitherto
been; but I make no Aplogy, <PB N="287" REF="294"> for I know you never meant
it &s;hould interfere with my Amu&s;ements. Now to proceed with my hi&s;torical
Anecdotes.</P>
<P>PROCEEDINGS in CRIMINAL CASES at <HI>VENICE.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN a Crime is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been committed at
<HI>Venice,</HI> the Courts of Ju&s;tice are more &s;olicitous to be
a&s;certained of the Fact, than to &s;ecure the Offender; and when they have
obtained the nece&s;&s;ary Proofs, they &s;end an Officer to enter publicly the
Hou&s;e of the Criminal; and on the Report of this Officer, that he is not be
found, (which is generally the Ca&s;e) they &s;ummon him to ap|pear in a longer
or &s;horter Space of Time, according to the Enormity of the Crime com|mitted,
to an&s;wer for the Offence, and till that Period is elap&s;ed, the Offender is
&s;afe from any Mole&s;tation, provided he does not appear on the Place of St.
<HI>Mark,</HI> or on the <HI>Rialto</HI>; and he may al&s;o demand three
De|lays, and if he thinks he cannot find Means to prevent the Affair coming to
a fatal I&s;&s;ue, <PB N="288" REF="295"> he may avoid a Trial, by getting a
Noble|man's Boat to convey him to &s;ome Part of the <HI>Terra Firma,</HI> from
whence he may ea&s;ily e&s;cape out of the State. Hence it proceeds, that
mo&s;t Criminals at <HI>Venice</HI> are judged by Contumacy, which they call
<HI>Bandire:</HI> but this Judgment is always accompanied with Condi|tions
proportionable to the Crime; for exam|ple, that the condemned Per&s;on &s;hall
never be able to purcha&s;e his Pardon; that whoever kills him in the
<HI>Venetian</HI> State &s;hall receive a con&s;iderable Reward, and double the
Sum, if they kill him in any other Territory. If the Crime &s;en&s;ibly touches
the Republic, they add to the Reward, the Liberty of delivering a
State-Pri&s;oner: but notwith&s;tanding this ap|parent great Rigour, there have
been In&s;tances of Noblemen who have been guilty of atro|cious Crimes making
their Peace, by Means of great Intere&s;t. When the Criminal is &s;e|cured, and
the Proce&s;s formed, the <HI>Avogador</HI> names his own Day, and, conducting
the Cul|prit before his Judges, pleads &s;trongly again&s;t him, exaggerates
every Particular of his Crime, and concludes with advi&s;ing a &s;evere
Puni&s;h|ment. The Advocate of the Party accu&s;ed <PB N="289" REF="296">
an&s;wers all the chief Points of the Accu&s;a|tion; and when he has performed
his Part, the Auditors retire, and the Opinion of the <HI>Avogador</HI> is
balloted again&s;t that of the Chiefs of the <HI>Quarantia,</HI> which is
always the mo&s;t gentle, and the Plurality of Balls determine the Fate of the
Offender. By this Means the Judges decide without giving the Rea&s;on of their
Opinion, and it is con&s;equently un|known who is for, and who is again&s;t the
Criminal. The Lawyers are obliged to plead in the <HI>Venetian</HI> Dialect,
that the mo&s;t ignorant Auditor may under&s;tand what pa&s;&s;es, as well as
the more learned Part of the A&s;&s;embly. The &s;evere&s;t Hard&s;hip, in the
Cour&s;e of Ju&s;|tice at <HI>Venice,</HI> is the Length of Time it takes to
terminate an Affair, owing to the Courts of Ju&s;tice being &s;o clo&s;ely
connected, and, if I may be allowed the Expre&s;&s;ion, playing into each
others Hands; &s;o that a poor Wretch is often &s;uffered to lie in Gaol for
two or three Years, before he can obtain an hearing, to expiate, as they
pretend, by this Puni&s;hment, part of his Crime. The frequent Sentences that
are pa&s;&s;ed upon Criminals, condemning them to an horrid ob&s;cure Pri&s;on
for eight or <PB N="290" REF="297"> ten Years, and often for Life, (where in
Win|ter they &s;uffer all the Rigour of extreme Cold, and in Summer of
exce&s;&s;ive Heat) are certainly more cruel Puni&s;hments than Death at
once.</P>
<P>Now in my u&s;ual abrupt Manner, I &s;hall conduct you at one Step
from temporal to &s;piritual Affairs, and &s;ay a few Words of the Church,
who&s;e Power is very limited in this Republic.</P>
<P>The STATE of the CHURCH.</P>
<P>THE Republic of <HI>Venice</HI> has ever been careful to exclude the
Clergy from their Coun|cils, and from all political Employments, even tho&s;e
who are noble <HI>Venetians.</HI> The Head of the Church is &s;tiled Patriarch
of <HI>Venice,</HI> and Primate of <HI>Dalmatia</HI>; he is always a Noble|man,
enjoys a good Revenue, makes a re|&s;pectable Appearance in public
Proce&s;&s;ions, but has no Power, even in eccle&s;ia&s;tical Af|fairs; at all
religious Functions, where the Pope's Nuncio is pre&s;ent, the Patriarch is
obliged to &s;end the Ma&s;ter of the Ceremo|nies <PB N="291" REF="298"> to
a&s;k his Permi&s;&s;ion to give the Ble&s;&s;ing. An Office of Inqui&s;ition
is allowed at <HI>Venice,</HI> but under &s;uch Re&s;trictions, as render it as
dependent on the political Government as any of the &s;ecular Tribunals are.
The Holy-Office is compo&s;ed of the Patriarch, the Nuncio, and a Friar, who
has the Title of Father In|qui&s;itor, and two experienced Senators, with|out
who&s;e Pre&s;ence and Con&s;ent, all Proceed|ings are null; by this Means, and
under this Pretext, that Matters brought before the In|qui&s;ition are contrary
to the Laws and Inte|re&s;t of the Republic, the greate&s;t Affairs of this
Tribunal are reduced to a mere Trifle. The Convents in <HI>Venice</HI> were
formerly &s;o ill regulated, that it occa&s;ioned much Scandal; but at
pre&s;ent, they are under better Di&s;ci|pline, for three Magi&s;trates are
appointed by the Senate, with an exten&s;ive Authority, to take Cognizance of
all that pa&s;&s;es in the fe|male Mona&s;teries; and though the Patriarch
him&s;elf allows a Prie&s;t to &s;ay Ma&s;s in one of their Churches, he is
obliged to obtain a Per|mi&s;&s;ion from one of the&s;e Magi&s;trates
be&s;ides, who limits this Licence to what Time he thinks proper. All the Women

are obliged, under Penalty of corporal Puni&s;hment, to have Leave in Writing
to execute them, &s;igned by one of the afore&s;aid Magi&s;trates. The Senate
has, within the&s;e few Years, made many wi&s;e and u&s;eful Reformations in
the re|gular Convents of Friars al&s;o; and have tran&s;|ferred from the

future to impo&s;e Penances of Fa&s;ting, Prayers, and &s;uch like conventual

<P>Now we mu&s;t return from &s;piritual to tem|poral Affairs again,
that I may have the Ho|nour to introduce you to the <HI>Venetian
No|ble&s;&s;e,</HI> who are not a little vain of the great Antiquity of their
Nobility, which they can certainly, many of them at lea&s;t, authenticate for
&s;everal Ages pa&s;t, better than any other Nation we are acquainted with.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="300">NOBILITY of the FIRST CLASS.</P>
<P>THE noble <HI>Venetians,</HI> who compo&s;e the fir&s;t Cla&s;s,
comprehend the Families of the twelve Tribunes who elected the fir&s;t Doge in
709: the <HI>Contarini, Moro&s;ini, Poli, Badovari, Tiepoli, Michele, Sanudi,
Gradenigo, Memo, Fa|lier, Dondolo,</HI> and <HI>Barozzi.</HI> The four Families
next to the&s;e in Point of Antiquity, date their Nobility from the Year 800,
when they &s;igned the Contract for the Abbey of St. <HI>George</HI> the Great;
the&s;e are the <HI>Ju&s;tiniani, Cornaro, Bra|gadini,</HI> and <HI>Bembo.</HI>
The fir&s;t are popularly called the twelve Apo&s;tles, and the la&s;t the four
Evangeli&s;ts. To this Cla&s;s may be added al&s;o, eight Families who look
upon them&s;elves as equal to the fir&s;t, becau&s;e long before <HI>il Serral
del Con&s;iglio,</HI> which happened in 1289, they were very con&s;iderable;
the&s;e are the <HI>Del|phini, Quirini, Soranzo, Zorzi,</HI> and
<HI>Marcello</HI>; the other three, by Rea&s;on of extreme Pover|ty, are fallen
into total Ob&s;curity, or perhaps are extinct: in this Cla&s;s too, may be
placed &s;ome illu&s;trious Families, who retired to <HI>Ve|nice,</HI> 
<PB N="294" REF="301"> from the Town of <HI>Acre</HI> in <HI>Syria,</HI> when
it was de&s;troyed by the <HI>Venetian</HI> General TIE|POLI, for having
revolted from its Obedience to the Republic after the fir&s;t Conque&s;t of it.
The greate&s;t Advantage the&s;e Families derive from their Antiquity is being
more con&s;idered in the Di&s;po&s;al of public Employments that reflect Honour
on the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors; in Point of Precedency, all the Nobility of
<HI>Venice</HI> rank alike.</P>
<P>NOBILITY of the SECOND CLASS.</P>
<P>THIS Cla&s;s is compo&s;ed of tho&s;e who can produce no authentic
Proof of their Nobi|lity earlier than 1289, when their Names were written in
the <HI>Libro d'Oro,</HI> which now contains more than five hundred Families.
It was at that memorable Event, <HI>il Serrar del Con&s;iglio,</HI> that this
Li&s;t of the Nobles was fir&s;t made out, and a Law enacted, that if the Names
of their Children were not written in this Book within a certain Time after
their Birth, they &s;hould forfeit their Title to Nobi|lity; and this al&s;o
happens, if the Contract <PB N="295" REF="302"> of their Parents' Marriage does
not legally pa&s;s the Senate, which it cannot do, if a no|ble
<HI>Venetian</HI> marries a public Performer, either in the Drama, or Mu&s;ic,
one who has been in a State of Servitude, or one who&s;e Father is of any
Profe&s;&s;ion or Trade, excepting a Phy&s;ician, a Manufacturer of gold or
&s;ilver Silks, or a Maker of Gla&s;s. As it is now upwards of four hundred
Years &s;ince <HI>il Serrar del Con&s;ig|lio,</HI> this Cla&s;s of Nobles is
highly e&s;teemed. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the&s;e Families that &s;till
exi&s;t, are the <HI>Moncenigo,</HI> the <HI>Capello, Fo&s;|carini, Fo&s;cari,
Grimani, Gritti, Garzoni, Love|dan, Dona, Nani, Malipiero, Pe&s;oro, Pi&s;ani,
Priuli, Ruzzini, Sagredo, Valier, Venier, Ba&s;&s;a|dona, &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI>
mo&s;t of the&s;e have given Doges to the Republic, and the reigning one at
pre|&s;ent is a <HI>Moncenigo.</HI> In this Rank are al&s;o placed thirty
Families that were ennobled nine|ty-one Years later, on the Termination of the
<HI>Genoe&s;e</HI> War, as a Reward for a&s;&s;i&s;ting the State with va&s;t
Sums of Momey; the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the&s;e that are remaining are the
<HI>Trevi&s;an, Vendramin, Renier, Ju&s;ti,</HI> and
<HI>Pa&s;|qualighi.</HI></P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Venice,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>May</HI> 6, 1766.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>TO proceed with my Subject where I left it in my la&s;t Letter, I
mu&s;t now talk to you a little of a younger Branch of the <HI>Venetian</HI>
Nobility, whom I &s;hall &s;tile the third Cla&s;s, and even the&s;e are
re&s;pectable for their Antiquity.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="304">NOBILITY of the THIRD CLASS.</P>
<P>IN this Cla&s;s are comprehended about eighty Families, who
purcha&s;ed their Nobility for an hundred thou&s;and Ducats each, during the
la&s;t War of <HI>Candia</HI>; &s;ome of the&s;e have remained poor and
di&s;tre&s;&s;ed ever &s;ince, by that In&s;tance of their Vanity: the
following are &s;till con|&s;iderable for their Wealth and Alliances, the
<HI>Videman, Labia, Zenobia, Fini, Manini, Gam|bara, &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> The
<HI>Savorgnan</HI> gave to the Republic &s;ome Fortre&s;&s;es of great
Importance, for guarding the <HI>Venetitian</HI> Territories from the
Encroachments of the <HI>Turks</HI>; and the <HI>Ben|zoni</HI> made the State a
Pre&s;ent of the Pro|vince of <HI>Crema,</HI> of which they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
the Seignory; and for the&s;e free Gifts the two Families received the Honour
of being enno|bled. Though the noble <HI>Venetians</HI> can au|thenicate the
Antiquity of their Nobility bet|ter than any People perhaps in <HI>Europe,</HI>
yet not content with this Advantage, they are fond of deriving their Families
from fabulous Ori|ginals: thus the <HI>Contarini,</HI> from a Similitude 
<PB N="298" REF="305"> of Name, pretend to be de&s;cended from an|tient
<HI>German</HI> Princes, who were &s;tiled Counts of the <HI>Rhine</HI>; the
<HI>Ju&s;tiniani,</HI> who give for their Arms a Spread Eagle, from thence
claim their De&s;cent from an Emperor of the Ea&s;t of their Name. I have been
told a curious Anecdote of this noble Family, that I will relate for your
Amu&s;ement: &s;ome Centuries pa&s;t, they fitted out a Ve&s;&s;el, under the
Doge VITAL MICHELE, to fight again&s;t the Emperor EMANUEL; (who had ill
treated the <HI>Venetians</HI> in the <HI>Levant)</HI> the
<HI>Ju&s;tiniani</HI> were all cut to Pieces, and the only &s;urviving Male was
a <HI>Benedictine</HI> Friar, for whom the Doge obtained a Di&s;pen&s;ation of
his Vows from the Pope, and married him to his Daughter, and from this Couple
are de&s;cended the pre&s;ent Family, according to this Legend, which whether
true or fal&s;e I &s;hall not take upon me to deter|mine. One Branch of the
<HI>Cornaro</HI> Family &s;tile them&s;elves <HI>Cornaro della Regina,</HI>
from one of their Hou&s;e having been Queen of <HI>Candia</HI>; but this
Alliance is rather a Blot in their E&s;cutcheon, if a certain evil Fame may be
relied on, who &s;ays, that the Hu&s;band of this Lady was an U&s;urper, whom
&s;he poi&s;oned, and <PB N="299" REF="306"> treacherou&s;ly betrayed the
<HI>Candians</HI> to the <HI>Ve|netians.</HI> A Gentleman has promi&s;ed to
intro|duce me to a Lady of this Name, who is a very agreeable, &s;en&s;ible
Woman, and who, he &s;ays, will &s;hew me the complete Ornaments of the
Toilette of the Queen above-mentioned, which is &s;till in the
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Family, and valued by them at many thou&s;and
Ducats.</P>
<P>The CITIZENS, or ORDER of SECRETARIES.</P>
<P>THE Citizens had formerly a large Share in the Government, and
<HI>Venice</HI> would probably have always remained in a State of Democra|cy,
had not the Re&s;entment of PIETRO GRA|DENIGO again&s;t many of the Cla&s;s,
who op|po&s;ed his being cho&s;en Doge, determined him to transfer the Power
entirely from the Peo|ple into the Hands of the Nobility, which he fully
effected by Means of the <HI>Serrar del Con&s;iglio</HI>; at which Period,
&s;everal of the No|bles lo&s;t their Rank, by not being admitted into the
Secret; and at pre&s;ent, by the Word Citizen, (at <HI>Venice)</HI> is meant
the Families thus <PB N="300" REF="307"> excluded from the Grand Council, many
of whom bear the &s;ame Name and Arms of the old Nobility; and to the&s;e may
be added ma|ny who by Merit or Money have obtained the &s;ame Privileges in the
Republic: they rank with the Nobility of the <HI>Terra Firma,</HI> and one at
lea&s;t of every Family wears the Ve&s;t, the &s;ame as the noble
<HI>Venetians:</HI> it has been thought, this is allowed them to prevent the
People from ob&s;erving how &s;mall a Num|ber of Men they are governed by.
Though, by a &s;tanding Law, every noble <HI>Venetian</HI> is forbid to enter
into Trade, yet they often join privately in Commerce with the wealthy
Citi|zens, which the Senate winks at, becau&s;e when they are become opulent,
they can make it turn to the Advantage of the State, by employing them in
expen&s;ive Emba&s;&s;ies. From among the Citizens are cho&s;en the Secretaries
of the Senate, Secretaries of Emba&s;&s;ies, and al&s;o Re&s;idents at foreign
Courts, for a noble <HI>Venetian</HI> can accept of no Employment of that kind,
but with the Title of Amba&s;&s;ador; and, for the &s;ame Rea&s;on, the
Republic receives no foreign Mini&s;ter in any intermediate Cha|racter between
a Re&s;ident and an Amba&s;&s;ador. <PB N="301" REF="308"> The Dignity of Grand
Chancellor is always conferred on one of this Cla&s;s; and as it is the
highe&s;t Honour that can be attained by a Per&s;on who is not noble, it is
generally given as a Reward to one who has &s;erved the Re|public well in
expen&s;ive Re&s;idencies. The Sub|jects of the <HI>Venetian</HI> State are by
&s;ome rated, at pre&s;ent, at about 2,655,448; but tho&s;e who have made very
accurate Enquiries upon this Head affirm, that they are over-rated by one
million.</P>
<P>Thus, my Friend, I have obeyed your Com|mands, and, in as conci&s;e
a Manner as I po&s;|&s;ibly could, have endeavoured to give you a ju&s;t Idea
of the very extraordinary Govern|ment of the Republic of <HI>Venice</HI>; I
flatter my|&s;elf, that by offering you this at one View, I have &s;aved you
the Trouble of turning over &s;ome Books which, be&s;ides being very dry
read|ing, you might not ea&s;ily have met with: but was this little Extract (or
whatever you are plea&s;ed to call it) to fall under the Ob|&s;ervation of a
le&s;s indulgent Judgment than yours, I &s;hould, with great Rea&s;on, fear
being charged with having given it in a &s;lovenly in|correct Manner. I &s;hall
only advance, in my De|fence, <PB N="302" REF="309"> that you well know how
limited my Time is at <HI>Venice,</HI> and how &s;trongly my natural
Incli|nation leads me to a much more entertaining Study than that of Hi&s;tory;
but to &s;uch a Friend as your&s;elf, I could not refu&s;e a Gra|tification
that it was in my Power to procure you, at the trifling Expence of putting
my&s;elf, for a few Hours, out of my Way; I only wi&s;h you may find my Attempt
&s;atisfactory. However, before I entirely quit this Subject, I cannot forbear
communicating to you a few Re|flections into which it has naturally led me; it
is melancholy to ob&s;erve, that in a Govern|ment &s;o wi&s;e in many of its
Parts, &s;uch gro&s;s Errors &s;hould be &s;uffered to pa&s;s uncorrected, as
mu&s;t in Time mo&s;t certainly de&s;troy the whole Sy&s;tem. A total Neglect
evidently ap|pears in the Education of the young Nobi|lity, which gives them an
Ignorance, I had almo&s;t &s;aid Brutality, that renders them very
di&s;agreeable in civil Society, and mu&s;t prove an Ob&s;tacle to their
becoming wi&s;e and pru|dent Magi&s;trates; and, added to this, the
Li|centiou&s;ne&s;s not only permitted, but even en|couraged, among the Clergy,
has produced &s;uch a &s;hameful Neglect in Matters of true 
<PB N="303" REF="310"> Religion, that Vice and Immorality &s;eem to pre|vail
among all Ranks of People, which mu&s;t in Time infallibly bring to a final
Di&s;&s;olution this once flouri&s;hing and powerful Republic. How amazingly
mu&s;t the Manners of the <HI>Ve|netians</HI> have been corrupted &s;ince their
fir&s;t E&s;tabli&s;hment, if the Abbate LANGIER has drawn a true Character of
them in his <HI>Storia Veneta,</HI> P. 130, Libro 1. He &s;ays,
<HI>E&s;igevan&s;i Co&s;tumi puri, Condotta &s;emplice, una Vita labo|rio&s;ia
per Ottenere da Lei la Qualita di Cittadino.</HI> The &s;ame Author quotes a
Letter, written by CASSIODORUS, who was Mini&s;ter from King THEODORICK to the
Tribunes of the mari|time I&s;les, which contains the&s;e Words, <HI>Pi&ugrave;

ob&s;erv|ing how very early <HI>Rialto</HI> (now called <HI>Venice)</HI> became
a con&s;iderable Place. LANGIER places the Election of PAOLO LUCIO ANAFESTE,
the fir&s;t Doge, in 697, which is twelve Years ear|lier than St. DISDIER's
Account, who &s;ays, this Prince was elected in 709. AMELOT DE LA HOUSSAI, in
his Hi&s;tory of the Republic <PB N="304" REF="311"> of <HI>Venice,</HI>
&s;ays, The Government of <HI>Venice</HI> by Con&s;uls and Tribunes, which
la&s;ted 270 Years, may be called her Infancy; the de|&s;potic Reign of the
Doges, from PAOLO LU|CIO ANAFESTE to SEBASTIAN RIANI, (which comprehends 463
Years) her Childhood; the Democracy, (which la&s;ted above a Century) her
Youth, which, &s;ays he, was robu&s;t and vigo|rous; but, as it often happens
in &s;imilar Ca&s;es, it was di&s;turbed and agitated by dan|gerous Paroxi&s;ms
of Wars and Revolts. Her Virility, he adds, began with <HI>il Serrar del
Con|&s;iglio,</HI> and la&s;ted till the War of the League of <HI>Cambray,</HI>
in 1309, which may be called the Beginning of her old Age.</P>
<P>The Republic liberally rewarded SANAZAR for the following very
flattering Epigram:

Notice of my in&s;ignificant Scrawl, that I am not the lea&s;t inclined to find
fault with the Length of Time you have taken in an&s;wering my la&s;t; and to

Favour, though I have not had it in my Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion longer than this
Afternoon, for it has lain &s;ome Time in <HI>London.</HI> I have been on a
Vi&s;it to a worthy Friend of ours, at this Place, for a Month 
<PB N="310" REF="317"> pa&s;t, and I a&s;&s;ure you, I have all the Rea|&s;on
in the World to be &s;atisfied with my Journey. Pray, good Sir, did you ever
&s;ee <HI>Bridgenorth?</HI> I believe not&mdash;Very well; then I mu&s;t give
you &s;ome little De&s;cription of this Place, (as I am habituated to do of
every new Spot I tread upon, whether large or &s;mall) for I think
<HI>Bridgenorth</HI> is, in Point of Situ|ation, by much the prettie&s;t I ever
&s;aw; it is divided into two Pari&s;hes, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Names of the
Upper and Lower Town. I was, the other Day, on a Vi&s;it to the Rec|tor of the
upper Pari&s;h; the Par&s;onage-Hou&s;e is a truly Gothic Structure, which
overlooks the Church-Yard, and though I cannot &s;ay, this is the mo&s;t
<HI>plea&s;ant,</HI> yet it certainly is not the lea&s;t <HI>u&s;eful</HI>
Pro&s;pect in the World, to a &s;peculative Mind. The upper Town is &s;itu|ated
on a Cliff, which renders it very whol|&s;ome, both from its Height, and the
Clear|ne&s;s of the Air. The View from our back Windows is more beautiful than
any Thing you can imagine: at the Foot of the Hill, the <HI>Severn</HI> rolls
its cry&s;tal Waves, in a charm|ing &s;erpentine Stream, down to the Banks
whereof, is a Succe&s;&s;ion of &s;loping Gardens, <PB N="311" REF="318"> that
vie with each other in Beauty, Fragrance, and Order. On the oppo&s;ite Side, in
a Vale, lies the lower Town, and above that are de|lightful Fields and Meadows,
inter&s;per&s;ed with fine Plantations of Trees of a long Growth. The Grounds,
by an ea&s;y A&s;cent, terminate at la&s;t in a Common, fifteen Miles long, on
which is a very good Hor&s;e-Cour&s;e; to the left, the Pro&s;pect is bounded
by a very high Rock, and on the right, as far as the Eye can &s;tretch, is a
fine open fertile Country; this &s;trong Contra&s;t has a mo&s;t happy Effect.
A noble Object in this inimitable Land&s;cape is the Ruin of an old Ca&s;tle,
which, from the Po&s;ition wherein it has been left by a Can|non-Ball, is,
perhaps, one of the greate&s;t Cu|rio&s;ities in <HI>Europe</HI>; it &s;trikes
us with Admi|ration and Awe, while we contemplate its nod|ding Towers, which
look as if they meant to overwhelm the heedle&s;s Pa&s;&s;enger in &s;udden
De|&s;truction; yet the <HI>Mathematicians</HI> affirm, that nothing le&s;s
than an Earthquake can move this immen&s;e Pile of Building. Round it is a
de|lightful Walk, where we often repair when the Weather is inviting; but when
this happens not to be the Ca&s;e, we have for our Amu&s;e|ment, 
<PB N="312" REF="319"> in the Hou&s;e, a <HI>Micro&s;cope,</HI> a reflecting
<HI>Telle&s;cope,</HI> and a <HI>Camera Ob&s;cura:</HI> the fir&s;t of the&s;e

<HI>Beau</HI> of an <HI>Humble Bee,</HI> in the very Act of &s;cratching a
<HI>Lou&s;e</HI> (Oh, &s;hameful Truth!) off the downy Part of his Neck, and
this little Animal, though &s;carcely perceptible to the naked Eye, is a mo&s;t
<HI>tremendous</HI> Figure, much re&s;embling a Hog, in the Gla&s;s; for my
Part, though I am not apt to be attracted by gaudy Co|lours, I am ab&s;olutely
in love with the ra|diant Armour of a green <HI>Beetle,</HI> richly gilded,

<HI>Cox|combs</HI> of the human Race, who place all their Happine&s;s in
Dre&s;s, when I con&s;ider that an humble Moth, in the &s;imple Habit which
Nature has given it, far out&s;hines them in all the Glitter of Lace and
Embroidery.</P>
<P>Whenever we amu&s;e our&s;elves with the&s;e Sort of Contemplations,
our <HI>worthy Neighbour the Pa&s;tor,</HI> never fails to make Improvement go

from the Pulpit, and he does this with the mo&s;t chearful Di&s;|po&s;ition
that can be, and totally free from the lea&s;t Shadow of

<P>Now, my good Friend, I have given you a very particular Account of
my pre&s;ent Situa|tion, and leave it to you to judge, if it is not very
agreeable. I mu&s;t add to this, that I got here Time enough for the Races,
where there was a great Appearance of Company, (for &s;uch a Place;) though Men

a Minuet with Mr. GREY, the fir&s;t Night: indeed, I have met with &s;o much

<P>I HAVE been &s;ome Time without hearing from you. I hope the
excellent Pre&s;i|dent of our Society is not laid up with her old Plague, the
Gout. If &s;ocial Worth could ward off Malady, &s;he would never be ill. 
<PB N="315" REF="324"> Perhaps you have not been in the Writing-Vein; &s;uch a
Fit attacks us all at Times, and you know it is our Rule reciprocally to allow
for it. If that is the Ca&s;e, do but &s;ub|&s;cribe the Initials of your Name
to a good, though &s;hort Account of your&s;elves, and I will re&s;t
contented.</P>
<P>I know not what I &s;aid in my la&s;t, but to the be&s;t of my
Rememberance, I gave you no Account of this tere&s;trial Paradi&s;e; but now I
am more acquainted with its Beauties, I will make an Attempt of that Sort.</P>
<P>The 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Sweet winding Tay,</HI>"</Q> which runs at the
Bottom of our Garden, for upwards of &s;ix Miles, forms the mo&s;t beautiful
Canal you can imagine; on the one Side of it, for the &s;ame Extent, are
delightful Walks, ri&s;ing one above another, no le&s;s than five Stages, all
amply &s;haded with &s;tately Trees, from around who&s;e Trunks the twining
Woodbine and Sweet-Briar pours forth a Profu&s;ion of Sweets; the &s;loping
Sides of the Walks are al&s;o planted with Va|riety of &s;weet-&s;melling
Shrubs, which being fanned by the fre&s;h Breezes off the River, 
<PB N="316" REF="325"> &s;catter Perfumes in a plenteous and grateful Return,
along the verdant Banks. At judicious Di&s;tances are placed gra&s;&s;y Seats,
mo&s;s-grown Cells, and flowery Arbours, all which, in their &s;everal Turns,
would invite us to &s;it down and indulge Contemplation, but that the
un|wearied Mind, enraptured with the&s;e enchan|ting Objects, urges us to
proceed in Search of new Beauties, and in that Pur&s;uit it cannot here meet
with the &s;lighte&s;t Di&s;appointment. The oppo&s;ite Side of the River is a
deep Bank, finely fringed with Wood of a younger Growth; at different Points of
View, we &s;ee the <HI>Brawn,</HI> another beautiful River, and a foaming
Ca&s;|cade; each paying the Tribute of their lucid Stores into the cry&s;tal
Bo&s;om of the <HI>Tay,</HI> who, as if con&s;cious of &s;uperior Merit, trips
nimbly along, in Murmurs of Self-Applau&s;e. This charming Pro&s;pect is at
la&s;t clo&s;ed with Views of di&s;tant Ruins, Hills covered with Trees,
fertile Vales, and Mountains of a mo&s;t vene|rable Appearance, covered with a
Heath &s;o beautiful, that it may vie with the glowing Amaranthus. The Gardens
are very exten&s;ive, and laid out in the fine&s;t Ta&s;te, that is to &s;ay,
with Grandeur and Simplicity united. <PB N="317" REF="326"> Nature appears here
in her lovelie&s;t Attire, and Art is contented to act in her proper Sphere, as
Handmaid to the Godde&s;s. We &s;eldom drink Tea in the Hou&s;e; &s;ometimes an
elegant Tent and <HI>Marquis</HI> is pitched at &s;ome fine Point of View;
&s;ometimes we re&s;ort to a fine banqueting Room, and often the Shade of a
large &s;preading Oak has the Pre|ference. Upon the&s;e Occa&s;ions the Duke
al|ways reads and we work. What mo&s;t attracts my Admiration here is, to
perceive that in every &s;urrounding Object, Utility adds Merit to Beauty: the
Farm-Hou&s;es on this E&s;tate are neat as the Hand of Indu&s;try can make
them, and chearful as the Smiles of Content; and every Creature that breathes
upon this Spot &s;eems to participate in the unfeigned Happine&s;s of the
excellent Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, who&s;e Goodne&s;s adds the highe&s;t Lu&s;tre to
Wealth and Title that they are capable of receiving. It was well &s;aid,
whoever made the Ob&s;ervation, that a good Action never lo&s;es its reward;
here was I &s;at down, full of Love and Re|&s;pect to write my deare&s;t
Friends a dutiful and loving Letter, when lo, and behold! I was made happy by
the Receipt of yours; and <PB N="318" REF="327"> truly rejoiced I am to find,
that my Fears are groundle&s;s; however, I don't feel happy at the Thought of
our Society's meeting with any Interruption to its Plea&s;ures. Believe my
A&s;&s;urance &s;incere, when I affirm, that I think the <HI>Content</HI> which
reigns therein, far excels in Value the highe&s;t Gratifications that Shew and
Grandeur can be&s;tow on its re&s;tle&s;s Votaries. Pray have you ever read DE
TOUCHE's Co|medies? I am po&s;itive &s;uch excellent Subjects, modelled for our
Stage, would be of public Emolument, and I &s;hould hope, would be productive
of both Honour and Profit to the Undertaker. I am afraid, by what you &s;ay of
<HI>Dunkeld,</HI> I gave you an Account of its Beauties in my la&s;t, if &s;o,
this will be a hor|rid, &s;tupid Repetition; in that Ca&s;e, commit me to the
Flames without the lea&s;t Remor&s;e of Con&s;cience. I hope the Sight of a
Letter directed by the Pen of a fine young Gen|tleman, won't give you any
Alarm; I con|fe&s;s it has done &s;o by me, &s;ince this new fa&s;hioned Way of

<P>HOW &s;trong and wonderful, my good Friend, is the Force of Habit! I
re|member, near upon my Departure from the dear Society in
<HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire,</HI> I felt an auk|ward Kind of&mdash;I don't know
what&mdash;when it was propo&s;ed that I &s;hould maintain a con|tinual
Corre&s;pondence with <HI>one of the other Sex,</HI> during my Ab&s;ence. I
felt this, even in &s;pite of the Conviction, that writing to <HI>you,</HI>
was, in fact, but writing to the <HI>whole Circle.</HI> How idle!&mdash;Now
that I have done &s;o, for &s;ome Time, I have taught my&s;elf to addre&s;s
you, with as little Re&s;erve, as if you were my <HI>real,</HI> in&s;tead of my
<HI>nominal</HI> Uncle. So much the better&mdash;Re&s;erve was not made for
true Friend&s;hip, and liberal Minds, and with none but &s;uch do I
corre&s;pond.&mdash;So much by Way of Digre&s;&s;ion; now, to return to my
little Travels.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="329">We have been the&s;e &s;ix Weeks pa&s;t at
<HI>Atholl</HI> Hou&s;e, a very magnificent Seat of the Duke's, twenty Miles
higher up in the High|lands than this Place is; though it far ex|ceeds
<HI>Dunkeld</HI> in Grandeur, yet I own the rural Beauties of the latter, have
more Charms for my humble Di&s;po&s;ition; Providence ha|ving, no doubt,
de&s;igned me to tread the 
<Q REND="inline">"Cool &s;eque&s;tered Vale of Life,"</Q> has bounded
my Ideas accordingly, and I look upon this as one of the numberle&s;s
In&s;tances I have ex|perienced of the Divine Bounty. The Coun|try about
<HI>Atholl</HI> is very romantic and beauti|ful; in &s;ome Places rather wild,
in others very fertile, which forms a fine Contra&s;t. The Hou&s;e is
immen&s;ely large, the Rooms are in|finite in Number, finely proportioned, and
elegantly furni&s;hed throughout; 'tis &s;ituated in a very exten&s;ive Vale,
amply wooded, and or|namented with four beautiful Rivers, all of which, at
different Places, lo&s;e them&s;elves in the <HI>Tay.</HI> Some of them from
the Tops of very high Mountains receive a prodigious In|crea&s;e from the
fine&s;t natural Ca&s;cades you can imagine, which is a Sight extremely
beautiful, <PB N="321" REF="330"> and at the &s;ame Time very tremendous. The
Kitchen-Garden is the fine&s;t Thing of the Kind that in my Life I ever &s;aw;
elegant Sum|mer-hou&s;es, Alcoves, Octagons, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> often
tempted us to drink Tea abroad, and enjoy the fine exten&s;ive Views at
Lei&s;ure. I &s;hould have told you, that the Vale is &s;urrounded with Hills
and Mountains, at &s;uch a Di&s;tance, that in|&s;tead of confining the
Pro&s;pect, they add great|ly to the Grandeur of it.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not omit to mention a natural Cu|rio&s;ity I here met with,
of a very extraordinary Kind: M' PHERSON, Laird of <HI>Foignes,</HI> two Years
before the Peace, rai&s;ed eight and twen|ty Men to &s;erve in
<HI>America</HI>; who unanimou&s;ly declared when they came to embark, that
they would not have enli&s;ted, had they not thought they &s;hould have
&s;erved under <HI>him</HI>; the ge|nerous Laird was &s;o &s;truck with this
Proof of their Attachment, that he declared they &s;hould not be
di&s;appointed, and, at the Age of &s;eventy-two, a&s;ked Leave to &s;erve as a
Vo|lunteer; during the Remainder of the Cam|paign he was pre&s;ent in every
Action, was always ready to expo&s;e his Per&s;on, and never 
<PB N="322" REF="331"> was a &s;ingle Day prevented by Illne&s;s from doing his
Duty; the Government has reward|ed his &s;pirited Genero&s;ity with a
<HI>Lieutenancy,</HI> and Leave to retire upon full Pay, &s;o that now, like
the Patriarchs of old, he wages more harmle&s;s Wars with the feathered Race
and &s;wift-footed Stag: now, at near four&s;core Years of Age, he is able to
walk and &s;cram|ble among&s;t the Mountains, the whole Day, in Pur&s;uit of
Game. How few, my good Friend, of our degenerate Countrymen, are at &s;uch an
Age able to &s;erve their King and Country! Enervated by Sloth and Luxury, long
before that Period of Life, they become a Burthen to them&s;elves, and a
Torment to all about them. When I looked at the military Garb and venerable
&s;ilver Locks of this northern Hero, I fancied I &s;aw in his &s;ingle
Per&s;on an Epitome of all the illu&s;trious <HI>Greeks</HI> that &s;erved in
the Siege of <HI>Troy</HI>; and if my Heart had been inclined to change its
pre&s;ent Situa|tion, I verily believe I &s;hould without He&s;i|tation have
be&s;towed it upon this warlike Mountaineer.</P>
<P>I fear the Sea&s;on is now approaching, when our friendly
A&s;&s;ociation mu&s;t lo&s;e &s;ome of its <PB N="323" REF="332"> agreeable
Ornaments; I feel for the Mortifi|cation a <HI>&s;en&s;ible</HI> Mind mu&s;t
&s;uffer, at being obliged to quit the Society of a favourite <HI>few,</HI> to
mix with the unthinking many: but hope that the kind Genius of Friend&s;hip
will inter|po&s;e a Gleam of Plea&s;ure, at the Pro&s;pect of a future
Meeting.</P>
<P>My Love to all, you know, is a con&s;tant Commi&s;&s;ion, and I am
&s;ure you will never forget to di&s;charge it. How is that be&s;t of good
Beings, our Pre&s;ident, our Patrone&s;s, our Life, our Spirit, our all? Is
&s;he not the wor|thie&s;t of Heaven's Worthies? Was there ever Acquaintance
who did not e&s;teem her, Friend who did not love her, Dome&s;tic who did not
ble&s;s her, or Indigent, who came to her Door, that did not pray for her? Long
may &s;he remain with us! and whenever it plea&s;es Pro|vidence to remove her
from Earth, may &s;he receive Ble&s;&s;ings in a future State, in as ample
Portions, as &s;he, through Life, has ever wi&s;hed and endeavoured to

<P>DID you ever expect to hear of, or from me again? Ever &s;ince I
received your la&s;t, I have lived the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ife of a Whirlagig, but be
a&s;&s;ured that I had not a Moment to tell you &s;o. The dear Spot I left was
al|ways in my Thoughts, and indeed as yet my poor Brain is far from being in a
compo&s;ed State; a &s;cribbling Moment too is the only good Thing that is
&s;carce here. A few Days after I received yours we left the calm Sweets of
<HI>Dunkeld,</HI> and went to pay a &s;econd Vi&s;it at Lord BREADALBANE's,
where all was Mirth, Mu&s;ic, Ma&s;querades, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> From
thence we &s;et forth on our Return towards a &s;outhern Sun, and gentler
Breezes, and &s;topped for a few Days at the elegant and &s;uperb Seat of Lord
BINGLEY, near <HI>York</HI>; there we found a brilliant A&s;&s;embly of Ladies
and Gentlemen, <PB N="325" REF="334"> who had met to dine and play Cards,
how|ever, mo&s;t of them went away in the Evening, and we remained a decent
Party for the re&s;t of the Time; from thence we bent our Cour&s;e to this
magnificent Ca&s;tle, hoping, wi&s;hing, and expecting, to find a quiet,
peaceable Family till <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> when we knew a deli|cious Riot was
always intended; but lo, and behold! here we found his Highne&s;s of
<HI>York,</HI> Lord and Lady CHARLES SPENCER, Lady CHATHERINE, and Mr.
BEAUCLERK, Lord and Lady LUDLOW, and a World more of fine Folks; the very
fir&s;t Night we were forced to join in a Ball, and every Day, whil&s;t his
Highne&s;s &s;tayed, we had Mu&s;ic in the Morn|ings, and Cards or Dancing at
Night; I be|lieve every Creature was fatigued with Plea|&s;ures, and I can
an&s;wer for one who was glad when it was over; the Duke of YORK was &s;o
plea&s;ed with his Entertainment, that it is not impo&s;&s;ible but he may
return at <HI>Chri&s;tmas.</HI> We are now a &s;ober decent Party of ten or
twelve, and, like rational Beings, read and work in the Evenings; and, to
&s;hew you that all this Di&s;&s;ipation does not totally bani&s;h &s;erious
Thoughts, we have Prayers con|&s;tantly <PB N="326" REF="335"> every Morning in
a beautiful Chapel in the Ca&s;tle. I take it for granted, that you know, all
this Time, that the Owner of this Palace is the Duke of MANCHESTER, who is a
very amiable young Nobleman, his Bro|ther, Lord CHARLES MONTAGU, is no le&s;s
&s;o, the Duche&s;s is beautiful, polite, and a very good young Woman; but the
Character that I could dwell upon with Delight for Ages, is Lady CAROLINE
MONTAGU, the Duke's Si&s;ter. If ever perfect Goodne&s;s cho&s;e to dwell with
mere Mortality, one may imagine it inhabits her Brea&s;t; and I flatter
my&s;elf, that you will not conceive the wor&s;e Idea of her Lady&s;hip, when I

perpetual Round of gay Amu&s;ements, with infinite Regret of the dear
<HI>&s;ocial Party,</HI> where|with I have &s;pent &s;ome of the happie&s;t and
mo&s;t rational Moments of my Life; I gave &s;uch a Picture of it to a young

that he made me pa&s;s my Word, if ever we met <PB N="327" REF="336"> at

Pro&s;pects, and &s;incerely wi&s;h &s;he may enjoy every Feli|city the

well.</P>
<P>I would attempt to give you &s;ome Idea of this Place, but there is
a Magnificence and Exten&s;ivene&s;s in it, that goes far beyond the Capacity

the pre&s;ent Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or has made many Improvements, and is making
&s;till more. The Plate and Apparatus for the Table is more &s;uperb than any

have lo&s;t no Time &s;ince our Arrival, in &s;eeing every Thing that is worthy
a Stranger's Curio&s;ity. The <HI>Thuilleries,</HI> of which <HI>French</HI>
Novelli&s;ts make &s;uch frequent Mention, is a plea&s;ant Place for the People
of Fa&s;hion to take the Air in. The <HI>Louvre,</HI> which, in outward Shew,
far exceeds any Palace we have, runs along one End of it, and on the oppo&s;ite
Side a fine Square is building, called the <HI>Place de Louis Quinze</HI>;
there are noble &s;hady Walks, and a charming Terra&s;s, that commands a fine
View of <HI>Paris</HI>; but the old Ta&s;te, in which the Center of the Garden
is laid out, is frightful, and exactly re&s;embles the Ornaments of a
Minced-Pye. There is another fa&s;hionable Rendezvous for the Evening Airings,
about a Mile out of <HI>Paris,</HI> that, I confe&s;s, plea&s;es me &s;till
more, called the <HI>Bois de Bullogne,</HI> where, in&s;tead of a &s;harp
Gravel and crowded Walks, like our Park, you may wander about 
<PB N="331" REF="340"> at full Liberty, and tread upon a verdant Car|pet all
the Time, which to tender-footed Folks makes a great Difference. We have &s;een
&s;e|veral private Collections of Paintings, and other Curio&s;ities, that do
great Honour to the Ta&s;te and Judgment of the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors: but nothing
charms me &s;o much, as a noble Collection of Pictures at the <HI>Palais
Royale,</HI> which belongs to the Duke of ORLEANS, fir&s;t Prince of the Blood,
and were chiefly purcha&s;ed by the famous Regent. The grand Opera here is the
fine&s;t Thing to &s;ee one can po&s;&s;ibly imagine; the Scenes are
&s;plendid, the Dre&s;&s;es rich and elegant, the Dances compo&s;ed with
infinite Ta&s;te, and finely executed, and the Stage much better filled than
ours: but the Mu&s;ic is truly dete&s;table; 'tis all <HI>French,</HI> and from
the Beginning to the End like a &s;olemn Dirge. As for the Voices, if you will
imagine a Concert compo&s;ed of Cats, Owls, and Monkeys, it will give you a
tole|rable Idea of the Harmony, and whoever a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;inates your Ears
with the greate&s;t Violence is mo&s;t applauded. The <HI>French</HI> comic
Opera is as agreeable as the &s;erious one is the re|ver&s;e. The Songs are all
&s;prightly <HI>Italian</HI> <PB N="332" REF="341"> Airs; the Scenery and
Dre&s;&s;es, as at the other, excel ours, and to my Fancy, this is the mo&s;t
agreeable Amu&s;ement <HI>Paris</HI> affords; their Manner of acting Plays, I
own, does not charm me, after being u&s;ed to the genteel, familiar Dialogue of
our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Comedies; and even in Tragedy, I think they have too
much Ener|gy, both of Voice and Action. I &s;hould not thus familiarly play the
Critic, were I not perfectly well acquainted with your Candour and Good-nature;
for, after all, I am talking of what I don't under&s;tand, and am as likely to
be wrong as right. So much by Way of Digre&s;&s;ion, a Liberty all modern
Novelli&s;ts allow them&s;elves; and now my Narrative pro|ceeds to the Chapter
of Fa&s;hions, for the Sake of the female Members of your Party. The Ladies in
general would, I believe, be hand|&s;ome, but for two &s;hocking Dabs of
Crim&s;on, or Scarlet, which &s;ome prefer, in a circular Form, directly under
each Eye, which makes them look ju&s;t like &s;o many Furies; the Hair
dre&s;&s;ed out of all Proportion, for often the Height of the Hair is more a
great Deal than the Length of the whole Face; even <HI>I,</HI> who am quite
moderate, am at lea&s;t three Inches <PB N="333" REF="342"> of
<HI>Toup&eacute;e</HI> taller than I was when I left <HI>Eng|land</HI>; the
Hoops are very &s;mall, the Ruffles very moderate, and the Necks more covered
than in <HI>England</HI>; the Gowns are made very high behind, and pin pretty
clo&s;e before, and almo&s;t as wide at Bottom as at Top; the Pleats of the
Sacks behind are made narrower than ours. The married Ladies (indeed we never
&s;ee any other in public) all wear very &s;mall Caps. The Court being in
Mourning, prevents our &s;eeing any other finery than Dia|monds, in which the
Ladies &s;eem to abound, in general, more than in <HI>England.</HI> Not a Head
of any Sort have I yet &s;een that is not ab&s;o|lutely plai&s;tered with
Pomatum and Powder, tho&s;e of the Poor as well as the Rich; I wonder the
Con&s;umption of Flower in this Metropolis of well-dre&s;&s;ed dirty People,
does not breed a Famine: the Streets are always &s;o crowded with them, that
you would &s;wear <HI>Paris</HI> was the mo&s;t populous Place, and the
<HI>Pa|ri&s;ians</HI> the mo&s;t idle Set of People, in the whole World. A
fa&s;hionable Cu&s;tom here is, when the Comedy is fini&s;hed, to drive to what
is called the <HI>Grande Boule Vert,</HI> one Side of which is &s;haded with
Trees, and the other filled with <PB N="334" REF="343"> large Coffee-hou&s;es,
finely illuminated, where you &s;ee all Manner of Sport going forward, as
Eating, Dancing, Mu&s;ic, Puppet-Shows, Conjurers, Fireworks, Fire-Eaters,
Giants, Lil|liputians, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> in &s;hort, you may be
amu&s;ed, in about the Length of the Mall, from eight in the Evening till three
in the Morning; but the genteel Way is only to drive up and down the Walk
without getting out of your Car|riage. I am afraid that my De&s;cription of
<HI>Paris,</HI> and its Amu&s;ements, will tire both your Eyes and your
Patience, at lea&s;t, it has done &s;o by me, and I have &s;cribbled in &s;uch
a Hurry, that it is not fit to &s;end; but I flatter my&s;elf, you would rather
have a Letter ill written, than none; I am mortified though, that it will
co&s;t you a great deal more po|&s;tage than it is worth, and by the Time it
reaches you, we &s;hall probably be pur&s;uing our Journey, &s;o that I cannot
hope to hear a Word of or from our dear Society till I get to <HI>Venice.</HI>
In the mean Time, I beg to be remembered in the kinde&s;t Manner, to every
Member, and that you will believe me to be, as I ever am, with Truth and
Sincerity, yours and the Society's truly affectionate and obliged</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Venice,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>Oct.</HI> 13, 1771.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>My dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE greate&s;t Plea&s;ure I can feel during my Exile is to hear good
Accounts fre|quently of tho&s;e Friends in <HI>England</HI> that are mo&s;t
dear to me. I hope you will an&s;wer this very &s;oon, and be &s;o good as to
direct your Letter to me as u&s;ual, under Cover to Mr. &mdash;, who has the
Care of &s;ending our Letters to the Secretary of State's Office, by which
Means I receive my Letters much &s;afer, than when they are not put in the
Packet. It is not yet quite three Months &s;ince I left <HI>England,</HI> and I
declare it appears to me three Years already; we were &s;o fortunate, as to
perform our Journey without one unlucky Ac|cident. On the twentieth of
<HI>July,</HI> of all Days in the Year, we began our Peregrinations, and
arrived here on the twentieth of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> after &s;topping about five
Days on the Road, to <PB N="337" REF="346"> &s;ee different Places that were
worthy of Ob|&s;ervation. We made no &s;mall Figure, I a&s;|&s;ure you, at
&s;etting out; our Train con&s;i&s;t|ing of two Po&s;t-Coaches and two
Po&s;t-Chai&s;es: to our no &s;mall Amu&s;ement, we were mi&s;taken for
Foreigners all the Way to <HI>Dover,</HI> which, I &s;uppo&s;e, was owing to
our wearing large <HI>French</HI> Caps without Hats, and our Gentlemen being
dre&s;&s;ed in loo&s;e <HI>French</HI> Coats, which are the mo&s;t convenient
Kind of Dre&s;s for tra|velling. We were not quite three Hours cro&s;|&s;ing
the Water; the Quickne&s;s of the Pa&s;&s;age &s;carcely made up for the
Roughne&s;s of it, which was really frightful, even to me, who am no
de&s;picable Sailor for a <HI>Female</HI> In &s;hort, I was the only Per&s;on
well enough to nur&s;e, which was very nece&s;&s;ary for the other Females in
our Party. At <HI>Calais</HI> we found two excellent Berlins waiting to conduct
us to <HI>Stra&s;bourg,</HI> in which we proceeded with our two
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Chai&s;es. Our Route was quite different from that by which
we once went from <HI>Stra&s;bourg</HI> to <HI>Paris,</HI> to my no &s;mall
Joy, for I think a twice-gone Road almo&s;t as bad as a twice-told Tale. I had
an Op|portunity, by this Means, of &s;eeing Beauties in <PB N="338" REF="347">
<HI>Champaigne,</HI> which, till then, I had no Idea of; for many Miles the
Road formed an actual Terra&s;s, bounded on one Side by little Hills,
inter&s;per&s;ed with Vineyards and Corn Fields, and on the other Side, the Eye
is led, by a gentle De&s;cent, down to the mo&s;t fertile Vales, the Verdure of
which could &s;carcely be con|ceived from the Painting of pa&s;toral Poetry;
through the&s;e, for an immen&s;e Way, meanders a mo&s;t beautiful &s;erpentine
River, who&s;e Banks are adorned with innumerable Droves of Cat|tle of every
Sort, which puts one in Mind of the peaceful Reign of the Patriarchs, &s;ince,
being undivided, they appear to be the Pro|perty of <HI>one</HI> Ma&s;ter. You
will &s;carcely think, my good Friend, that the&s;e &s;miling Scenes could
rai&s;e melancholy Ideas, and yet they had that Effect upon my Mind; in
almo&s;t every Village we pa&s;&s;ed through, which had looked beautiful at a
Di&s;tance, we found all the Appearance of Wretchedne&s;s and Want that you
&s;ee in the mo&s;t dreary Parts of <HI>Savoy,</HI> for what the Extravagance
and Luxury of the Prince of CONDE (part of who&s;e immen&s;e Ter|ritory this
is) leaves to the Pea&s;ants, is wrecked from them by the lazy Prie&s;ts, who,
like Lo|cu&s;ts, <PB N="339" REF="348"> &s;eem to be &s;ent only to eat up the
Riches of the Land; here you &s;ee no ho&s;pi|table Gentleman's Seat; no warm,
neat Cot|tages; tho&s;e are Comforts re&s;erved only for the
<HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who would, perhaps, be more grate|ful for the Ble&s;&s;ings
they enjoy, if they po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed fewer of them. But to return to our
Journey; the fine Sea&s;on of the Year, good Roads, and every where tolerable
Accommoda|tions, carried us in twelve Days to <HI>Stra&s;bourg,</HI> where we
&s;topped for three Days, and where you may, if you plea&s;e, &s;uppo&s;e we
&s;hall re|main till you hear from me next, as I &s;hall defer the Re&s;t of my
Account of our Jour|ney for a future Letter.</P>
<P>The Ma&s;king is ju&s;t begun, and two comic Operas, and two
Play-Hou&s;es opened; I have been once at the Opera, and caught &s;uch a Cold,
(partly, I &s;uppo&s;e, a Tribute to the Sea|&s;on of the Year, and partly to
Change of Cli|mate) that, for fear of the like Accident, I &s;hall frequent
Theatres very little, unle&s;s I am tempted by a Party.</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="349">I fear, my dear Friends, your Patience will be
quite tired out before you get to the Con|clu&s;ion of this very long Letter;
but as I can only &s;end a <HI>&s;ingle Letter,</HI> I could not re|&s;i&s;t
taking the large&s;t Paper, and I cannot bear to &s;end it you blank.</P>
<P>I am ju&s;t in the di&s;agreeable Situation I was this Time two
Years, when I was &s;o happy to be with you, almo&s;t all my worldly Goods
being at the Mercy of the Waves, and the Ship ought to have been here at

<HEAD>LETTER LXXIII. Mi&s;s N&mdash; to Mr. HULL.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Venice,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>Jan.</HI> 26, 1772.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Received with infinite Plea&s;ure, my dear Friends, your very kind
Letter; the good Account you give of your&s;elves is really and truly a
<HI>Happine&s;s</HI> to me, and you have my &s;incere Prayers and good
Wi&s;hes, that your Health and Spirits may daily improve. I make no Doubt, but
your Tour was a de|lightful one: there is about you, our &s;weet Patrone&s;s, a
certain Chearfulne&s;s and Good-humour that proceeds immediately from the
Heart, that not only illuminates her own Di&s;|po&s;ition, but in&s;pires
tho&s;e about her with the mo&s;t plea&s;ing Sen&s;ations the human Mind is
capable of feeling. I beg of you to pre&s;ent my be&s;t Affections to the
Doctor and Mrs. W&mdash;, and a&s;&s;ure them, that I take the &s;incere&s;t
Part in their Affliction; my good <HI>Papa</HI>'s filial Piety always appeared
to me a <PB N="342" REF="351"> &s;hining Part of his Character&mdash;my Love
and &s;incere good Wi&s;hes attend every Member of the <HI>dear Society</HI>;
would to God I could &s;ay, I had any Pro&s;pect of being &s;oon re-united to
that be&s;t of all po&s;&s;ible Societies: but, alas! that is not to be hoped
for: what <HI>mu&s;t be, mu&s;t be,</HI> and I make no Doubt 'tis right.</P>
<P>Now, my dear Friend, I mu&s;t beg of you to take a Step back with me
to <HI>Stra&s;bourg,</HI> for there, I think, we parted la&s;t; from thence we
&s;teered our Cour&s;e to <HI>Ball,</HI> (or <HI>Bazill,</HI> as it is called
in the Maps) in <HI>Switzerland.</HI> This Change in our Route delighted me,.
We were induced to make this little Round, to avoid a great Part of
<HI>Swabia,</HI> where we heard the Roads were almo&s;t impa&s;&s;able, the
Water un|whol&s;ome, a great Scarcity of Provi&s;ions, and the Mea&s;les raging
every where; <HI>Ball</HI> is ex|tremely well worth the Ob&s;ervation of
Travel|lers; the Situation is on a very noble Part of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> which
runs through the Town; it al&s;o merits the Attention of the Lovers of
<HI>Virt&ugrave;,</HI> as the be&s;t Relict of the famous HOL|BENS (known by
the Name of <HI>Death's Dance)</HI> is pre&s;erved in the public Library. From
<HI>Ball</HI> <PB N="343" REF="352"> we proceeded to <HI>Schafhau&s;en,</HI>
another of the prote&s;tant <HI>Swi&s;s</HI> Cantons; about three Miles hence
is the Cataract of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> an Ob|ject which I contemplated with a
Mixture of <HI>Horror</HI> and <HI>Plea&s;ure,</HI> ea&s;ier to be felt than
de&s;cribed, which I beg you will tell my <HI>Papa</HI> conveyed to me a
clearer Idea of the <HI>Sublime and Beautiful,</HI> than I could ever gather
even from Mr. BURKE. We next travelled a very plea&s;ant Road, and caught many
fine Views of the famous Lake <HI>de Con&s;tance:</HI> but upon the whole,
though I like <HI>Swi&s;&s;erland</HI> well enough, <HI>en-pa&s;&s;ant,</HI>
there is an unpoli&s;hed melancholy Air, even in the greate&s;t Towns, that is
di&s;gu&s;ting. When we got into the <HI>Tyrrol,</HI> every Thing lo&s;t the
Charm of Novelty to me, and I had only the mortifying Reflection to make, that
when I la&s;t pa&s;&s;ed tho&s;e rugged Paths, I was going towards
<HI>England,</HI> and now, alas! was going from it. As we met with no
Adven|tures new or &s;urpri&s;ing, I will trouble you with no further
Particulars of our Journey, &s;ave that we arrived at <HI>Venice</HI> the
twentieth of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> after being exactly a Month on the Road,
without meeting with one Overturn, bro|ken <PB N="344" REF="353"> Axeltree, or
other &s;ini&s;ter Accident what|ever.</P>
<P>And now let me &s;ay a few Words for my|&s;elf, independent of
Company. Since the twen|ty &s;ixth of <HI>December,</HI> every Creature here,
that has Spirits enough to be &s;o, has appeared quite mad; indeed,
<HI>Venice</HI> (in Carnival-Time e&s;pe|cially) is only fit for tho&s;e who
can place their Happine&s;s in <HI>Vice, Folly,</HI> and
<HI>Di&s;&s;ipation</HI>; indeed, I am not only a profe&s;&s;ed, but a
&s;in|cere Enemy to the&s;e three: you will believe me, when I tell you, that I
am horridly out of my Element here, and I feel the greate&s;t Conviction, that
I &s;hall never ta&s;te a hearty Satisfaction, till I again enjoy our rational,
dear friendly Society; but I fear the Time is very far di&s;tant when I &s;hall
be allowed to par|take of &s;uch enviable Amu&s;ements. You know I mean, in
this Declaration, only to refer to the Cu&s;toms of the Place, not to the Party
where|with I came, which is indi&s;putably as rational and amiable as
<HI>can</HI> be enjoyed, uninterrupted with Hurry of <HI>Place</HI> and
ceremonial Vi&s;itors. I believe you have often heard me mention a Mrs.
S&mdash;, a very particular Friend of mine, <PB N="345" REF="354"> who has been
&s;ettled here many Years, and now, having lo&s;t a Hu&s;band in his
ninety-ninth or hundredth Year, &s;he is preparing to return to
<HI>England</HI>; we have talked &s;o much and &s;o often of you all, that
&s;he is per&s;uaded &s;he is ac|quainted with you, and begs me to give her
Compliments to you; and I verily believe, &s;he will be tempted when &s;he
arrives, to make you a friendly Vi&s;it.</P>
<P>I am a&s;hamed to &s;end you &s;uch a horrid Scrawl, but I have
wrote it by Snatches, with mo&s;t vile Implements; the Date will faith|fully
&s;hew you it was begun on the twenty|&s;ixth of <HI>January,</HI> and now I am
concluding it on the ninth of <HI>February,</HI> &s;o that you may be
a&s;&s;ured, though I <HI>&s;eem</HI> dilatory in writing, I, by no Means,
intend to <HI>be</HI> &s;o. I was in Hopes to have popped this into a
Di&s;patch: but, alas! they are grown &s;carce Commodities at our Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>We have no le&s;s than three Operas and four Play Hou&s;es open;
and, would you believe it! I am grown &s;o <HI>old</HI> or &s;o
<HI>&s;tupid,</HI> that I pre|fer a Book or a Pen by the Fire-Side, to 
<PB N="346" REF="355"> any of them. I am much abu&s;ed for this Want of
Ta&s;te; but &s;o hardened a Sinner am I, that it grows every Day &s;tronger on
me. Adieu, my dear good Friend; may every Fe|licity and Ble&s;&s;ing attend you
all! Such is the &s;incere Prayer of your ever</P>
