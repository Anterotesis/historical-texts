<HEAD>THE DEDICATION, To The <HI>QUEEN.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WERE it Po&s;&s;ible for me to offer at your ROYAL FEET, a Tribute, &s;o Important, as to MERIT your MAJESTY'S Acceptance, I had never paid my Debt of Duty, in &s;o poor a Manner; But, &s;ince the
<PB REF="5">
Smile of HEAVEN, upon the WIDOWS MITE, In&s;tructs us, that the WILL, not POWER, mu&s;t Enrich the Offering; I am al|mo&s;t led to hope, YOUR MAJESTY will Stoop to the Reception of &s;o Low a Pre&s;ent, when you &s;hall be pleas'd to know, 'tis all, I have to give; For LIFE, and FORTUNE are &s;o firmly Yours already, that I cannot hope to ta&s;t the Length of one, or Worth of t'other, but by holding BOTH in Your MAJESTY'S Di&s;po&s;al.</P>
<P>THE Sacred Power of PIOUS MAJESTY, Commands not only Love, and Loyalty, from Subjects, and Dependants, but (as the Attra|ctive Virtue of the Wond'rous MAGNET draws the Sturdy IRON to its Sway,) may Challenge an Authority, to Rule the Salvage Minds of Independant Infidels. The Mighty Glories of your MAJESTY'S Succe&s;sful Reign have bent more Kingdoms than You Govern, to an Envy of the <HI>BRITONS,</HI> Hap|py in Your Influences; And Experience Taught me, that while <HI>BRITAINS NAME</HI>
<PB REF="6">
is NOW the Prai&s;e, and Wonder of &s;uch Na|tions, as BEFORE &s;carce knew it, The Pro|digious Honour, paid Her NAME, is on|ly owing to the Virtues of Her MO|NARCH.</P>
<P>TO whom then, MIGHTY QUEEN, &s;hou'd I Addre&s;s my Self for a Protection of my Labours, but to the THRONE of MA|JESTY, where CRITIC'S Malice, and the Sting of CENSURE cannot Reach me, and where HEAVEN has &s;eem'd to Point our Marks of Duty, and Humility to lie, as by the Seat of MERCY, and the VICEROY of <HI>OMNI|POTENCE.</HI></P>
<P>BE therefore pleas'd, Great Ruler of the HEARTS, as well as PERSONS of Your People, to accept this humble Offering, which I lay, with Duty at Your GRACIOUS FEET; For, as the &s;mall Improvement, ma|ny Years continued Travels, thro' the Rougher Corners of the World, have made me Con&s;ci|ous of, may &s;o be Crown'd with the
<PB REF="7">
Great Honour of YOUR NOTICE, all my Future Aims, and Utmo&s;t Applications &s;hall be, how to make my Self attain one Step a|bove the Character, which now I can with Hone&s;ty, and Faithfulne&s;s, lay hearty Claim to, of,</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT was an admirable Ob&s;ervation of Sir <HI>ROGER L'ESTRANGE,</HI> That <HI>a Book, that Fac'd the World without a PREFACE, &s;hou'd be look'd upon, as much Unfini&s;h'd, as a BEAU, who comes to Court without a PERRIWIG;</HI> For it is not only grown a kind of <HI>Law,</HI> by long continu'd <HI>Cu&s;tom,</HI> but is even become a <HI>Nece&s;&s;ary</HI> Labour for the <HI>Vindication</HI> of a Man, who <HI>dares</HI> a&s;&s;ume the Name of <HI>Author,</HI> from the <HI>not alone Sharp Critici&s;ms,</HI> but <HI>Reflections,</HI> and <HI>Scurrilities,</HI> he will be &s;ure to meet with.</P>
<P>WE Live, it &s;eems, in a <HI>Fault-finding Age,</HI> and 'tis almo&s;t become a <HI>Crime,</HI> or <HI>Argument of Soft|ne&s;s,</HI> (a New-fa&s;hion'd Word for <HI>Folly</HI>) in a <HI>Gen|tleman,</HI> to Read a <HI>Book,</HI> with any <HI>other Aim,</HI> than to <HI>Condemn,</HI> or <HI>Cen&s;ure</HI> what he &V;nderstands not.</P>
<P>I'M &s;ure, I have ju&s;t Rea&s;on to affirm a <HI>Truth,</HI> I have been taught by the <HI>Ingratitude,</HI> (I wou'd not wil|lingly

<P>THE <HI>Rea&s;ons,</HI> which induc'd me to Addre&s;s the World, with an Account of what I had ob&s;erv'd, in <HI>Tra|velling</HI> &s;o many Years together, were not <HI>Vanity, Am|bition, Mercenary Hopes,</HI> or any of the <HI>Common Motives,</HI> which urge Great Numbers on to Write, <HI>and build them up</HI> to the <HI>Fond Name</HI> of <HI>Author: Heaven</HI> indu'd me with a <HI>Soul,</HI> too Hone&s;t to become a <HI>Pro&s;titute</HI> to the <HI>Poor Dro&s;s</HI> of <HI>Intere&s;t;</HI> Nor were my <HI>Circum&s;tances</HI> &s;uch, as might <HI>reduce</HI> me to a <HI>Want</HI> of tho&s;e <HI>Advantages,</HI> which have <HI>too often</HI> made a <HI>Good Man, Infamous.</HI></P>

<P>HENCE they were Encourag'd to Impo&s;e upon the <HI>Town,</HI> by Printing <HI>Old Books,</HI> with <HI>New Titles,</HI> Selling Others at a <HI>Double Rate;</HI> and <HI>Authors,</HI> knowing, they cou'd reap no <HI>Profit</HI> from the <HI>Publication</HI> of their <HI>Writings,</HI> left 'em wholly to the <HI>Book&s;eller's Direction;</HI> whence the <HI>Pre&s;s</HI> was commonly <HI>Corrected,</HI> and the <HI>Book</HI> ex|pos'd to <HI>Publick View,</HI> with as much <HI>Nicety,</HI> and <HI>Learning,</HI> as became a <HI>Book&s;eller's Capacity.</HI></P>
<P>BY having Printed &s;ome <HI>Few Little E&s;&s;ays of my own, the Common way,</HI> I went as far, as any <HI>Line</HI> cou'd reach, towards <HI>Fathoming</HI> the <HI>Con&s;ci|ence</HI> of a <HI>Book&s;eller,</HI> or <HI>Two,</HI> and <HI>thence</HI> became Acquainted with their <HI>Cu&s;toms,</HI> well enough to care, as little as I cou'd, for Dealing with them; and, unwilling to have This <HI>Book</HI> come out, as <HI>Un|correct,</HI> as it might probably have done, and &s;ee the <HI>Town</HI> impos'd on, by too <HI>High a Price,</HI> or let the <HI>Book come out</HI> too meanly Printed, or on <HI>Com|mon Paper,</HI> I re&s;olv'd to have it in my <HI>Power,</HI> to

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Policy.</HEAD>
<P>THE Political Maxims of an Arbitrary Government, may not improperly be compar'd to the &s;preading Roots and twi&s;ting Fibres of &s;ome Tall Oak, who&s;e elevated Heigth expo&s;ing it to double Danger, by the raging Force of Stormy Winds a|mong its Branches, has no Security but the Rooted Depth, by which it is &s;upported again&s;t the &s;tronge&s;t Efforts of contending Tempe&s;ts; and certainly a Government &s;o va&s;tly Large, &s;o inexpre&s;&s;ibly Rich, and &s;o &s;trangely different from all other, mu&s;t be &s;upported &s;trongly by &s;ome uncommon Policy; without which Guard, the daring Ambition of a&s;piring Princes, and the formidable violences of inte&s;tine Di&s;cords, would like &s;ome &s;urprizing Earthquake, break fiercely thro' the Bands of Duty, and by their factious Con&s;equences involve the Empire in mo&s;t inevitable Ruin.</P>
<P>THAT I may with greater ea&s;e De&s;cribe the &s;olid Foundations, upon which the <HI>Turks</HI> have built their Safety, 'twill be nece&s;&s;ary to di|vide their Maxims into Two Parts. The Fir&s;t, are tho&s;e by which the <HI>Sultan</HI> &s;upports &s;ecurely his unrival'd Grandeur, and the &s;ure Dominion of his exten&s;ive Empire. The Second, are &s;uch Notions as are taught his Subjects with the earlie&s;t Rudiments of their common Knowledge, and diffu&s;e with ea&s;e a certain Awful Duty, or almo&s;t Idolatrous Veneration thro' the whole Country for the Per&s;on of their Emperour; and are the only cau&s;es of that mild Obedience and mi&s;erable Servitude, with which they own them&s;elves his Slaves, and endeavour vigorou&s;ly to exert an uncommon Indu&s;try, in hopes to gain &s;ome Mark of Fa|vour from the ine&s;timable Bounty of their Common Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The fir&s;t Maxim of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Policy.</NOTE>I &s;hall begin with the <HI>Sultan,</HI> who&s;e fir&s;t Maxim of Policy is to Depo|pulate as much as may be the remoter Parts of his wide Empire, the more effectually to &s;trengthen its Center. <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Rea&s;ons upon which this Maxim is founded.</NOTE>The Rea&s;ons he gives to prove the U&s;efulne&s;s of this Maxim are the&s;e, Fir&s;t, That Countries far di|&s;tant from his Eye, might with more ea&s;e and le&s;s danger be induc'd to &s;ome fatal Rebellion, were the Number of their Inhabitants but any way proportionable to the Conveniency of their Situation. Secondly, By the mi&s;erable and barren Condition of a di&s;-peopled Country, 'twould be found a matter of inconceivable difficulty, for an Invading Enemy to penetrate their Empire with a numerous Army; &s;ince their Troops without the chargeable Inconvenience of va&s;t quantities of Pro|vi&s;ions, would never be able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t in a Country, who&s;e flying hand|ful of Inhabitants, would immediately convey what little Stores their Poverty afforded them, to Woods and Mountains, and Places inacce&s;|&s;ible to People unacquainted with the Pa&s;&s;es of the Country: Another Rea&s;on is, the utter impo&s;&s;ibility, which Di&s;carded Favorites (by this Means) find to e&s;cape the Anger of their Offended <HI>Sultan</HI>; for knowing no Place capable of A&s;&s;i&s;ting or Concealing them, unle&s;s they Re|tire to &s;ome <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Country, they rather choo&s;e a voluntary Re|&s;ignation of their Lives and Fortunes to the undi&s;puted Will of their Great Ma&s;ter; and quietly &s;ubmit their Necks to the Sword of the Exe|cutioner.</P>

<P>TIS Perhaps the mo&s;t difficult Undertaking a Man can put him&s;elf upon, to write of the numerous Intricacies of Foreign Govern|ments, and particularly One like that of <HI>Turkey</HI>; the Native Haugh|tine&s;s of who&s;e In&s;ulting People, and their coy Deportment to the Travelling Subjects of a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Country, are &s;o many inacce&s;&s;ible Barriers to the Curio&s;ity of their Ob&s;ervations: But 'tis a Task yet more difficult to endeavour a &s;atisfactory De&s;cription of that Part of their Con&s;ti|tution which compo&s;es this Chapter, &s;ince the Offices of their Religion are &s;o clo&s;ely interwoven with tho&s;e of their Law, that 'tis almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to treat of either without involving both in a promi&s;cuous Confu&s;ion.</P>

<P>BY the foregoing Chapters, the prodigious Power and unlimited Autho|rity of the <HI>Turki&s;h Sultan</HI> has been fully taught the Reader: But tho' his Rule is Arbitrary, and his Sway De&s;potick and Tyrannical, he &s;ubmits the Management of his Large Dominions to the depending Government of a deputed <HI>Viceroy</HI>; and indeed it has ever been the Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI>

<P>THERE is a private <HI>Divan</HI> or Court of Ju&s;tice held in the Palace of the <HI>Vizier Azem</HI> every Wedne&s;day and Thur&s;day; on the other Days (ex|cepting Friday, which is the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Sabbaoth) the <HI>Divan</HI> is kept in an open Chamber of the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> whither the <HI>Vizier</HI> is magnificently Attended by a great number of Pur&s;uivants and Serjeants; at his Arrival he is &s;aluted with the noi&s;y Acclamations of the People, and guarded by a &s;ort of Soldiers, maintain'd purpo&s;ely for that U&s;e, to his Place upon the Bench; where be|ing Seated with the <HI>Cadeele&s;cheer</HI> or Lord Chief Ju&s;tice, and Six <HI>Viziers</HI> of the Ben<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, who are Grave Men that have formerly born Offices in the Govern|ment,

<P>THE melancholy Con&s;equences of this Abu&s;e of Power, have as is be|fore declar'd, induc'd the Government to &s;tudy Means of ruining this Order, which not being able to accompli&s;h by the dint of Force, they have inven|ted

many &s;ubtil Wiles to Weaken Gradually the Foundations of their Power; for whereas the Matchle&s;s Di&s;cipline of Ancient <HI>Janizaries</HI> gave bright Examples to Inferiour Orders, they are now admitted frequently without the Gradual Labours of Probationary Servitude.

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX. Of the <HI>Grand Signior</HI>'s Seraglio, and particularly the Apartment of his Women.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Introdu|ction.</NOTE>I Told the Reader <HI>in the Preface of my Book,</HI> by what uncommon means I was &s;o happy as to gain admi&s;&s;ion to a <HI>Palace,</HI> which for many Ages has been kept a &s;ecret to the &s;earching Knowledge of our <HI>Europaean Travellers,</HI> and &s;hall <HI>now</HI> proceed to entertain him with a wonderfull, but plea&s;ant and &s;incere account of new Di&s;coveries, which <HI>like the Golden Indian World,</HI> lay long unenter'd (as appearing barr'd again&s;t our View with un&s;urmountable Impediments,) but gain'd at la&s;t, will &s;pread throughout our <HI>We&s;tern Regions,</HI> &s;uch &s;urprizing Plenty of her valuable Product, as may more than recompence the patient &s;tay of your expecting Curio&s;ities.</P>

<P>THE Petty Governors of every little <HI>Di&s;trict,</HI> are oblig'd to gather the re&s;pective <HI>Quota</HI>'s of the <HI>Villagers</HI> about them, and &s;et out with Guards &s;uf|ficient to defend the Money towards the next great <HI>Town</HI> to their dependant Re&s;idences; here they mu&s;t deliver it to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Aga,</HI> or the <HI>Governour</HI> of the Place, demanding his Di&s;charge for their Acquittance of a Duty &s;o incumbent on their Offices.</P>

<P>THE Hill was overgrown with a large Wood, thro' which appear'd no other Pa&s;&s;age than a &s;mall Foot Path, and that not beaten, but a very unfrequented way, which led me thro' an hundred &s;everal turnings to A&s;|cents extreamly &s;teep, and intricate as Labyrinths.</P>

<P>ANOTHER rea&s;on for this la&s;t opinion is, the <HI>Muddy thickne&s;s of the Waters, when they overflow the Country,</HI> for, Ru&s;hing violently thro' &s;o many Tracts of Fertil Land, they tear up great and hourly quantities of fatning &s;oil, which, mixing thickly with the &s;welling &s;treams, is left upon the &s;corch'd and barren Sands of <HI>Egypt,</HI> of a very deep and <HI>&s;limy</HI> &s;ub&s;tance.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Emblem of crafty Trea&s;on.</NOTE><HI>B&V;T on the other &s;ide the Rock,</HI> behind the Monarch's Back, appear'd a brisk and fiery <HI>Youth,</HI> who, having mounted by the help of a <HI>tall Ladder,</HI> was ju&s;t &s;teping, from its <HI>topmo&s;t Round</HI> upon the <HI>Rock it &s;elf,</HI> with &s;eeming re&s;olution to attack and kill the <HI>King,</HI> with a long Spear, pre&s;ented at him, was witheld from his Intent by means of a <HI>large Chain,</HI> de&s;cending from a <HI>Cloud</HI> above his Head, and twining &s;uddenly about his Arms, while <HI>he him&s;elf</HI> was wounded in the Bo&s;om by a Sword, directed by a Hand, which i&s;&s;ued likewi&s;e from the <HI>Cloud</HI> abovenam'd.</P>
<P>NOW in my Imagination, <HI>'tis a Task of no great difficulty,</HI> to unfold the My&s;tery, contain'd in this intelligible <HI>Hieroglyphic</HI>; perhaps I am mi&s;taken, but as probably am not; however, right, or wrong, I'll give the Reader my <HI>Opinion,</HI> let him judge, as he thinks proper.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The meaning of the Hiero|glyphic.</NOTE>THE <HI>Monarch,</HI> repre&s;ented in his <HI>Regal Ornaments</HI> I take, to mean a <HI>King,</HI> who Rules with <HI>State</HI> and <HI>Power:</HI> The <HI>Sword</HI> denotes the Ju&s;tice of his <HI>Office:</HI> The <HI>di&s;dainful Look</HI> implies a &s;corn of <HI>Trea&s;on,</HI> and its <HI>Pra|cti&s;ers.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Rock,</HI> whereon he &s;its enthron'd, was doubtle&s;s meant, to &s;igni|fy his <HI>Governments Solidity; its craggy Roughne&s;s</HI> was de&s;ign'd to &s;how, what dangerous Precipices, we are led to by Ambition.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Emblem of Open Rebel|lion.</NOTE>THE <HI>Ra&s;h, arm'd Multitude,</HI> who &s;trive <HI>in vain,</HI> before the Face of the above-nam'd <HI>Monarch,</HI> to a&s;cend and wound him, are as <HI>Emblems</HI> of of tho&s;e daring and imprudent <HI>Rebels,</HI> who will openly pre&s;ume to carry on their Hate to <HI>ju&s;t Authority,</HI> and pro&s;ecute the Dictates of their Impious Wi&s;hes in the <HI>Face</HI> of <HI>Maje&s;ty.</HI></P>
<P>THEIR <HI>numerous Repul&s;es,</HI> and the <HI>fruitle&s;s Efforts</HI> of their eager Ap|plication &s;erve to <HI>&s;hew,</HI> how much it is impo&s;&s;ible, by open Practices of <HI>Lawle&s;s Villany,</HI> to <HI>&s;hock</HI> the Throne of an <HI>e&s;tabli&s;h'd Government,</HI> or &s;ucceed in the Endeavours of a <HI>treacherous Inclination.</HI></P>
<P>THE &s;iery Youth, ju&s;t mounting from a Ladder to the <HI>&s;ummit</HI> of the <HI>Rock</HI> behind the <HI>King,</HI> and holding up a <HI>Spear,</HI> as if with de&s;ign to <HI>kill</HI> him, &s;ignifies in my Opinion, that more crafty kind of <HI>Trea&s;on,</HI> carried on by un|derhand Intrigues and &s;ubtle Secrecy, and powerfully a&s;&s;i&s;ted by <HI>prevailing Parties.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Emblem of Heaven's Ju&s;tice.</NOTE>THE <HI>de&s;cending Cloud,</HI> from which appears the <HI>Chain,</HI> that binds him, and the <HI>Hand,</HI> which wounds his Bo&s;ome with a <HI>Spear,</HI> was meant by the <HI>Egyptians of Antiquity</HI> to repre&s;ent <HI>that Great,</HI> but <HI>unknown Power,</HI> by who&s;e &s;ure, tho' &s;ecret means of Ju&s;tice, they perceiv'd the &s;acred Per&s;ons of <HI>Ju&s;t Monarchs,</HI> &s;afely guarded from <HI>de&s;igning Treachery,</HI> and very rarely knew a <HI>Villain</HI> Die unpuni&s;h'd.</P>
<P>NOW, if the Ingenious Reader will but <HI>put together</HI> the&s;e Interpretati|ons of the <HI>Hieroglyphic My&s;tery,</HI> he will &s;oon perceive a <HI>nice connexion</HI> of its &s;everal Parts, which we may read, as follows.
<Q><P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Hiero|glyphic lite|rally Inter|preted.</NOTE>That Prince's Throne, who governs ju&s;tly, is &s;o &s;trongly &s;eated on the Rock of Power, that he can look with &s;corn upon the vain Attempts of tho&s;e Mad Rebells, who, invading his Prerogative with open Vi|olence, encounter &s;uch prodigious and undreamt of Difficulties, that they fall in their Endeavours wretched Victims, to the di&s;appointment of Ambition.</P>

But that more <HI>Crafty, Politic,</HI> and <HI>Private Traitor,</HI> who unge|nerou&s;ly aims at a Succe&s;s in his Rebellion, from the undi&s;cover'd Practices of clo&s;e Di&s;loyalty, tho' he may pro&s;per for a while in unde|tected Villanies, is, notwith&s;tanding his great Cautions, watch'd in e|very Step, he makes, by the <HI>unknown Omni&s;cience</HI> of &s;ome Hea|venly Being, who, when his Plot &s;eems ripe for Execution, chains his Will, o'erthrows his Trea&s;on, and amazingly converts his un|&s;u&s;pecting Malice to his own De&s;truction.</P></Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The particu|lar Applicati|on of the Hie|roglyphic.</NOTE>THIS general Interpretation led me to conclude, the <HI>Hieroglyphic</HI> was de&s;ign'd a Monitory Lecture, to di&s;&s;wade Mankind from Practices of <HI>Trea&s;on,</HI> by an artful Declaration of its fatal Con&s;equences; and the <HI>Application</HI> in particular directed me to gue&s;s, the <HI>Mummy,</HI> on who&s;e Body it was repre|&s;ented, had been formerly &s;ome Youth, made wretched by the <HI>Knowledge,</HI> if not Executed for the <HI>Practice</HI> of &s;ome <HI>Trea&s;on</HI> or Rebellion.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How they were betray'd.</NOTE>IT &s;eems their <HI>Guide</HI> (&s;ince <HI>taken</HI> and <HI>Impal'd alive</HI> for his abominable Villany) had held a Corre&s;pondence with the <HI>Arabs,</HI> and betray'd his <HI>Charge,</HI> by ent'ring with them to the <HI>Catacomb,</HI> and giving them the <HI>Slip</HI> at a convenient Opportunity thro' the other <HI>Hole,</HI> &s;et open purpo&s;ely; the <HI>Servants,</HI> who remain'd <HI>above,</HI> were &s;iez'd on, and made Pri&s;oners by the <HI>Arabs,</HI> who return'd to Plunder their <HI>dead Ma&s;ters</HI> at a time, when they un|happily found <HI>us,</HI> an unexpected Booty in the Gin, they came to.</P>
<P>PROBABLY, the rea&s;on of their leaving the <HI>Italian Gentlemen</HI> un|plunder'd, when they &s;hut them in, was owing to the di&s;tant Pro&s;pect of &s;ome <HI>Turki&s;h Party,</HI> frequently <HI>Patroling,</HI> as I &s;aid before, from Place to Place about tho&s;e <HI>De&s;arts.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLVII. Of the <HI>Red-Sea.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Red-Sea</HI> is &s;o fully known already, by the <HI>Geographical</HI> De|&s;criptions of our own Country Writers, and the exqui&s;ite Per|formances of the <HI>Mathematic</HI> Authors of mo&s;t <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Nations, that I mean not <HI>here</HI> to Touch on tho&s;e <HI>notorious</HI> Ob&s;erva|tions, which have <HI>long ago</HI> been made by others, but inform my Rea|der of &s;ome <HI>new Di&s;coveries</HI> of little matters, which I made my &s;elf.</P>
<P>BUT fir&s;t, it will be Requi&s;ite to &s;ay a Word or two, relating to the <HI>Etymology</HI> and <HI>Ports</HI> of the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> which having done, I will proceed to mention the Remarks, I made, as they occur to my Remembrance.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the <HI>Red-Sea</HI> is &s;o call'd.</NOTE><HI>RHYTHRA,</HI> in the <HI>old Egyptian Language,</HI> &s;ignifying <HI>Red,</HI> was for|merly the Name of a <HI>great Monarch</HI> of that Country, who gave the <HI>Sea</HI> his own <HI>Denomination,</HI> which has been &s;ince mi&s;taken, by affinity of Sound, and <HI>Mi&s;-interpreted</HI> the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> by tho&s;e, who fix'd the Name upon it, which it bears at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Second O|pinion.</NOTE>OTHERS think, e&s;pecially the <HI>Jews,</HI> Inhabiting the <HI>Ea&s;tern Coun|tries,</HI> that it was call'd the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> from the prodigious ruin, and great overthrow of <HI>Pharaohs</HI> Army, in their Pa&s;&s;age over it, in the <HI>pur&s;uit</HI> of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and his <HI>God-defended I&s;raelites,</HI> but as the Blood, there Spilt, was very little, tho' &s;uch <HI>Multitudes</HI> were Drown'd, I look upon this gue&s;s, as an Improbable Opinion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Third, and the mo&s;t pro|bable.</NOTE>ANOTHER Notion, and perhaps the true&s;t of the Three, is, that 'tis call'd the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> from the <HI>Redne&s;s</HI> of the <HI>Sands,</HI> o'er&s;preading all the Bottom, whence the Waves receive a kind of <HI>red Reflection,</HI> and the <HI>Water</HI> thence appears, as if 'twere &s;tain'd with certain <HI>Juices,</HI> of a <HI>redi&s;h Colour</HI>; This is made more Rea&s;onable from the Etymology of the <HI>Euxine,</HI> com|monly call'd the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> from the <HI>Blackne&s;s</HI> of the <HI>Sands,</HI> which lie at the Bottom.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Sea Port Towns</HI> are very numerous, and very different from each other, in <HI>Magnificence,</HI> or the <HI>conventency</HI> of <HI>Harbour,</HI> &s;ome are much ex|pos'd to dangerous &s;helves, and Rocky Shallows, others both commodious, large, and &s;tately, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aden, <HI>the great</HI> Sea-Port Town.</NOTE>but the only Place, de&s;erving a particular De&s;cription, is the Port, call'd <HI>Aden,</HI> in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Turks,</HI> and not alone the Large&s;t. but the Riche&s;t, and mo&s;t celebrated <HI>Sea Port Town</HI> of all <HI>Arabia.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Its De&s;cripti|on.</NOTE>IT is Situated in about <HI>thirteen Degrees of Northern Latitude,</HI> direct+ly in the Center of a kind of <HI>Amphitheatre,</HI> or <HI>Semicircular Ridge of Moun|tains,</HI> jetting out prodigious <HI>Promontories</HI> into the <HI>Sea,</HI> for a con&s;iderable Length, on either <HI>Horn</HI>; the <HI>Harbour</HI> is not only &s;afe, but capable of holding at an <HI>Anchor</HI> near a <HI>Thou&s;and Sail of Ships,</HI> by the mo&s;t mode&s;t Computation.</P>
