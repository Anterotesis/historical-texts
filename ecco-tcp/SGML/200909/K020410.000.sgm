<P>IN mo&s;t of the Arts and Sciences, Pro|fe&s;&s;ors have formed general outlines of the plan, method, and arrangement, to be followed by the pupils who &s;tudy them.</P>
<P>Some &s;ort of analy&s;is might be of equal &s;ervice to young proficients in parliamen|tary eloquence&mdash;A multitude of words, de|livered with rapidity and vehemence, puzzle and confu&s;e tho&s;e who are unacquainted with the technical trick of debate&mdash;It will be of u&s;e therefore to prepare for our juvenile &s;enators, a compendious outline
<PB N="vi" REF="5">of &s;uch arguments as may mo&s;t probably be employed at the opening of the approach|ing Se&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>And, in order to detect the fallacy of much popular rhetoric, brief ob&s;ervations will be annexed to each of the <HI>Common|place</HI> topics; by which means, when any of the old Oppo&s;ition Orators begin to flou|ri&s;h away on the&s;e <HI>trite</HI> arguments, the young members may, by recurring to the proper &s;ection in the Analy&s;is, immediate|ly find mo&s;t of the <HI>thoughts,</HI> and many of the <HI>words,</HI> that will be u&s;ed, <HI>for,</HI> or <HI>again&s;t</HI> the Que&s;tion; with this main difference, that each will be much &s;horter, and pro|bably both more intelligible.</P>
<P>The Author is aware, that nothing can be &s;impler than this plan; it being much
<PB N="vii" REF="6">of the &s;ame nature with an <HI>Exhibition Ca|talogue,</HI> which merely de&s;cribes the &s;ub|jects of the &s;everal compo&s;itions pre&s;ented to public critici&s;m; and po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome read|ers may think it might have been well, to complete the &s;imile, by &s;ubjoining in this in&s;tance, as well as in the former, the names of the &s;everal Arti&s;ts; but, though &s;omething of that dramatic kind, was ra|ther &s;ucce&s;sfully attempted in a pamphlet, called <HI>Anticipation,</HI> it &s;eems more advi&s;e-able to avoid the lea&s;t appearance of per&s;o|nality, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion:&mdash;The ridicule that was then, with &s;ome proprie|ty, directed again&s;t the tediou&s;ne&s;s, or the pedantry, or the droll dotage, that charac|terized &s;ome individual &s;peakers; would now be wholly unnece&s;&s;ary: it never was
<PB N="viii" REF="7">a ta&s;k of difficulty to expo&s;e the folly of mock eloquence; once atchieved, the re|petition would be as di&s;gu&s;tful as the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>But &s;ophi&s;try a&s;&s;umes new &s;hapes, and acts under various di&s;gui&s;es; like the ma|licious enchanter in romance, to be finally overcome, it mu&s;t be attacked in all its transformations; yet he who engages in this war of words, can be but little expo&s;ed to any charge of pre&s;umption; it is a com|bat far more tire&s;ome, than perilous; and however &s;everely his patience may be exer|ci&s;ed, he will have but few occa&s;ions to ex|ert his &s;trength; &s;o that as his utmo&s;t tri|umph can be only proportionable to &s;o inferi|or a conte&s;t, he may be &s;ecure at lea&s;t from the imputation of vanity in undertaking it.</P>

<HEAD>THE LATE AND THE NEW PARLIAMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE late parliament was the mo&s;t in|famous, &s;lavi&s;h, ba&s;e, &s;ordid, venal, mean, incon&s;i&s;tant, de&s;picable parliament, that ever exi&s;ted.&mdash;It betrayed the rights of the people, trampled on their privileges; violated their maje&s;ty; &s;ervilely crouched to prerogative; and wa&s;ted the blood and trea&s;ure of the public, to &s;atiate private ambition and avarice.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="11">Hence national re&s;entment was univer&s;ally rouzed; the elective body, to a man, de&s;pi|&s;ed the repre&s;entative, and all ranks and orders of people anxiou&s;ly expected the happy mo|ment of the di&s;&s;olution. At the approach indeed of that awful cri&s;is, political frailty felt a &s;ort of death-bed penitence; it was the hectic virtue of a moment: the panic however &s;oon &s;ub&s;ided; and, flu&s;hed with new hopes of a protracted exi&s;tence: the old &s;eptennial methodi&s;t ro&s;e, like Voltaire from &s;ickne&s;s, impatient for deeper vices, and anxious for more aggravated profli|gacy.</P>
<P>"Such <HI>was</HI> your parliament&mdash;Look you now what follows"&mdash;A young phoenix ri&s;ing from the a&s;hes of the old!&mdash;the be&s;t of all po&s;&s;ible parliaments!&mdash;a pure, un|corrupt, delegation from the true &s;ource of all real power, the people: unfettered by connections; unclogged with errors; free to con&s;ult; to deliberate; to determine; for the public &s;afety! "Such <HI>is</HI> your par|liament."</P>

<HEAD>ANSWER.</HEAD>
<P>IT is difficult to give a ju&s;t idea, of the a|nimated &s;tile of oppo&s;ition invectives; particularly on &s;uch a theme as the pre&s;ent, where the free indulgence of them, is un|checked by any of tho&s;e awkward re&s;traints, which &s;ome young men have of late, &s;o un|con&s;titutionally thrown on them.&mdash;A de|cea&s;ed parliament is one of tho&s;e <HI>immaterial</HI> objects, that every one may attack with perfect impunity; and indeed, under the pre&s;ent re&s;trictions, it is no &s;mall conveni|ence to the component parts of &s;uch a cor|porate body, to have in the very nature of their con&s;titution, a &s;afe re&s;ource for the exerci&s;e of their wilde&s;t rancour, and mo&s;t fanciful a&s;perity. It is however uncom|monly whim&s;ical, that almo&s;t the very &s;ame &s;et of men, who actually compo&s;ed the &s;ubject of this invective, &s;hould be them&s;elves the auditors of it; and at the &s;ame moment that they are &s;tigmatized in
<PB N="12" REF="13">their late capacity, they &s;hould receive &s;o premature a panegyric in their new one; yet &s;uch is almo&s;t preci&s;ely the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>The la&s;t parliament and the pre&s;ent par|liament being very nearly one, and the &s;ame.&mdash;It is true indeed, there have been &s;ome exchanges, and different branches of par|ticular families have taken their rotation in election honours; but <HI>&s;till</HI> both parliaments are <HI>e&s;&s;entially</HI> and <HI>effectually</HI> alike: &s;o that, with a few incon&s;iderable exceptions, the returns and re-elections incontrovertibly prove, that all the imputations of national odium and contempt, &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly thrown on the la&s;t parliament, mu&s;t at lea&s;t have been gro&s;sly exaggerated, if not entirely fal&s;e.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>penitential vote,</HI> &s;o often, and &s;o vauntingly relied on, it will always be re|membered, that the Hou&s;e <HI>at large,</HI> refu|&s;ed to <HI>report</HI> the <HI>ab&s;tract propo&s;ition</HI> &s;o fear|fully pa&s;&s;ed, by a committee of inferior
<PB N="13" REF="14">numbers&mdash;It was indeed a florid weakne&s;s; the hectic effort of exhau&s;ted &s;edition; that "Like the faint offer of a latter &s;pring, &s;erved but to u&s;her in the fall, and withered in an affected bloom."</P>

<HEAD>COMPLIMENTARY INVITATIONS TO BE SCATTERED AMONG THE YOUNG MEMBERS.</HEAD>
<P>AS it is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible that any gen|tleman of &s;pirit, or independence, can &s;upport the mini&s;try, without forfeiting all preten&s;ions to virtue, ju&s;tice, honor, and common &s;en&s;e, there can be &s;till le&s;s doubt, that tho&s;e, who are lea&s;t hackneyed in the ways of public life, and con&s;equently mo&s;t accutely &s;en&s;ible of the allurements of popularity, will in&s;tantly join the pre&s;ent con&s;titutional, upright, con&s;i&s;tent, generous, ju&s;t, oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>What can be &s;o flattering to youthful am|bition, as being immediately enrolled in a band of genuine patriots, and regi&s;tered among the only Briti&s;h worthies of the age! what ampler field can the world afford for the di&s;play of genius, learning and elo|quence, than that glorious conte&s;t of <HI>Ameri|ca</HI> with <HI>England,</HI> of freedom again&s;t tyran|ny!</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="16">In the mo&s;t pro&s;perous times, the <HI>&s;upport</HI> of mini&s;ters is an inglorious and vulgar ta&s;k, compared to the <HI>control</HI> of them. There is little, or no &s;cope for rhetoric, in plain &s;tate|ments, regular calculations, legal preci&s;ion, and &s;uch other trite and plain modes, as men in office <HI>mu&s;t</HI> nece&s;&s;arily pur&s;ue. On the contrary, <HI>oppo&s;ition,</HI> has inexhau&s;tible themes of eloquence&mdash;&s;u&s;picions, alarms, menaces, and predictions, (not to mention impeachments, which cannot well recur &s;o regularly) are rich and con&s;tant &s;ources of popular declamation. Be&s;ides, one of the chief benefits that ari&s;e from new parlia|ments, is the acce&s;&s;ion of fre&s;h &s;upplies of genius and cultivated abilities. And perhaps, there never was a time, when &s;uch immen&s;e quantities of both were introduced into the Hou&s;e of Commons as upon the pre&s;ent oc|ca&s;ion&mdash;young gentlemen, not only endow|ed with prodigious abilities, but who have been for many years back, in <HI>training</HI> for debate, abound on all &s;ides.&mdash;What an in|finite pity would it be then, were &s;uch im|proved talents ob&s;cured and &s;hrowded from public admiration, in the dull details of of|ficial
<PB N="16" REF="17">politicians!&mdash;In the moment of peril and di&s;may, it is happy for this nation at large to have &s;elected men, formed, as it were, for the &s;alvation of their country.&mdash;It is no le&s;s fortunate for tho&s;e, who po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uch talents, to have them called into ac|tion, at &s;o aweful a cri&s;is.&mdash;Indeed, it is one of the great benefits ari&s;ing from the pre&s;ent calamities, that gentlemen have now much finer opportunities and more numerous &s;ubjects, for di&s;playing their talents, than they could po&s;&s;ibly have enjoyed in more quiet times; and which too, if not imme|diately taken advantage of, may irretrievably e&s;cape by &s;ome unlucky change, to pro&s;pe|rity abroad, or humanity at home.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="answer">
<PB N="17" REF="18">
<HEAD>ANSWER.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT antidote can rea&s;on provide again&s;t &s;uch potent incantations?&mdash;The cold &s;ugge&s;tion of more temperate ad|vice would feebly re&s;i&s;t the Syren voice of popular allurement; and vainly is judgment addre&s;&s;ed, where the &s;ubtle appeal is more fancifully made to vanity and inexperience. To examine and analize the &s;everal properties of real <HI>debate,</HI> in di&s;tinction to tho&s;e of wild <HI>declamation,</HI> would appear too refined: to ridicule the prevailing pa&s;&s;ion for oratory, too trite: &s;till le&s;s would it be proper, under this divi&s;ion, either to enquire into the merits of Minority, or to di&s;cu&s;s the ju&s;tice and &s;incerity of their claims to public confidence.</P>
<P>To rai&s;e <HI>new levies</HI> for the &s;ervice of Oppo&s;ition, is &s;o entirely the <HI>intere&s;t</HI> of that &s;et of men who command the <HI>old troops,</HI> that it cannot fail to create &s;ome flight doubts of the perfect &s;incerity and pure zeal of their
<PB N="18" REF="19">complimentary invitations. But (without con&s;idering &s;uch an adventurous junction in the more &s;erious light of a de&s;ertion from every &s;olid and &s;ub&s;tantial intere&s;t of our country) it may not be wholly unu&s;eful to &s;ugge&s;t how impo&s;&s;ible it is for the Oppo&s;i|tion, in its pre&s;ent &s;tate, to afford tho&s;e nu|merous and happy occa&s;ions for the di&s;play of genius and eloquence, which its advocates &s;o &s;peciou&s;ly hold out as the &s;tronge&s;t incen|tives to youthful ambition.</P>
<P>The <HI>Minority</HI> has long been directed, and controuled, by a few leading orators; who, after years of fatiguing &s;ervice, are mo&s;t ju&s;tly entitled to rank as veterans in their pro|fe&s;&s;ion; and are now too rea&s;onably jealous of their e&s;tabli&s;hed precedence, to participate in fame with the raw recruits they are &s;o anxious to enli&s;t&mdash;One of their leaders has expre&s;sly publi&s;hed <HI>the Articles of Party;</HI> with much fairne&s;s and candour, avowing the nece&s;&s;ity of obedience to a common leader, and of acting in due &s;ubordination to his commands. With more zeal, indeed,
<PB N="19" REF="20">than policy, this champion of party very frankly decried and ridiculed all &s;eparate ex|ertions and individual efforts, as attempts of equal inefficacy and pre&s;umption; and ra|ther ra&s;hly di&s;covered &s;o much more of this degrading &s;y&s;tem than former politicians had thought it wi&s;e, or decent to reveal, that many men of proper pride and &s;pirit were di&s;gu&s;ted with the <HI>Rockingham &s;ervice,</HI> and beg'd leave to <HI>re&s;ign their commi&s;&s;ions</HI> &mdash; Others of &s;ubtler talents, laboured with more art and ca&s;ui&s;try to explain away the&s;e dangerous <HI>articles:</HI> but &s;till, however &s;peciou&s;ly they argued, they always had the precaution to maintain their rank in eloquence, by the ex|clu&s;ion of every new competitor, and to &s;e|cure the <HI>credit,</HI> by monopolizing the <HI>time,</HI> of debate.</P>
<P>&mdash;No young man of talents has, for years back, met with the patronage of Oppo&s;ition; every &s;ucceeding &s;e&s;&s;ion was the echo of the former; the &s;ame quantity of time has been annually devoted to the &s;ame tediou&s;ne&s;s and protraction of debate; even &s;tated hours &s;eemed almo&s;t appointed for each particular
<PB N="20" REF="21">orator; nor was it ever a very difficult cal|culation to imagine who was actually &s;peak|ing, at any given time, by only looking what o'clock it was; for the daily movements of their rhetoric were as mechanically exhi|bited, by a periodical &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of figures, as tho&s;e of the famous <HI>Stra&s;burg clock;</HI> ex|cept indeed, when &s;ome rough unmanage|able country-gentlemen <HI>would</HI> &s;tart out, like the &s;avages of St. Dun&s;tan's, to give a ha&s;ty &s;troke, or two, and then retire again, to re&s;t in peace on their unpoli&s;hed clubs.</P>
<P>But above all, the particular &s;tile of abi|lities, which characterize the pre&s;ent ma|nager of Oppo&s;ition, renders all inferior ex|ertions in eloquence, almo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s and ri|diculous&mdash;There is a magnitude in extraor|dinary talents, that contra&s;ts, and caricatures the comparative inequality of tho&s;e who are placed in competition with them. Qualities, which, carried to an extreme, are &s;triking from their enormity, (&s;uch as de&s;perate ve|hemence and outrageous acrimony) become ridiculous in imitation, and impotent by in|feriority. They re&s;emble theatrical thunder
<PB N="21" REF="22">compared with real; and &s;erve only to bur|le&s;que an original, that can never be &s;ucce&s;s|fully imitated. The minor malcontents, and mimic republicans of the pre&s;ent day, would do well therefore to reflect, how very contemptible the petty partizans of faction have been, in all ages and countries. There were dozens of duodecimo Catilines, who buzzed con&s;piracy in every corner of the Forum, though hi&s;tory has &s;carcely &s;tooped to name them; Ravaillac had his <HI>monk committees</HI> and <HI>holy a&s;&s;ociations,</HI> who&s;e <HI>debates</HI> and <HI>re&s;olutions</HI> have been charitably con&s;igned to oblivion: nor has there ever been any de&s;perate leader, from the rank of <HI>Catiline</HI> to <HI>Cade,</HI> who has not boa&s;ted a gang of followers, <HI>officious,</HI> and <HI>ob&s;cure; bu&s;y,</HI> and <HI>forgot.</HI></P>

<P>THE gip&s;ey Fortune-teller <HI>"takes a bond of Fate."</HI> and to en&s;ure her &s;kill, mo&s;t generally <HI>perpetrates</HI> the mi&s;chiefs &s;he predicts.&mdash;To this judicious policy it may be chiefly owing, that Egyptian divina|tion has &s;o long &s;urviv'd all other oracles and &s;upernatural in&s;pirations of antiquity&mdash;The Pythian prie&s;te&s;s became &s;u&s;pected, or un|intelligible, from eva&s;ion, or ambiguity; and was equally &s;tigmati&s;ed by Philip's gold, or the chains of Crae&s;us.&mdash;Even our home&s;pun witches <HI>"palter'd in &s;uch double &s;en&s;e,"</HI> that, by their own equivocation more than any terrors of law, they forfeited the credulous veneration they had &s;o long u&s;urped.&mdash;In &s;hort, the gip&s;ey pur&s;ues the be&s;t &s;y&s;|tem for all human prophecies. This en|&s;uring Sybil, boldly corrects the uncertainty of time, and chance, and with great pru|dence relies on her own dexterity, for the &s;ecure&s;t voucher of her pre&s;cience.</P>

<P><Q>I pledge my&s;elf to this Hou&s;e (&s;ays one of them) that the confidence which Ame|rica may ju&s;tly repo&s;e in the &s;ympathetic ardor, that in&s;pires a very great part of this nation, will make her &s;corn your menaces, and fly to arms, to vindicate her rights.</Q>&mdash;Here is one in&s;tance among a thou&s;and o|thers of a patriotic prediction, that, by the liberal encouragement it holds out, goes great lengths to effect the event it foretells, and is, in fact, the leading cau&s;e of its own ac|compli&s;hment.&mdash;<Q>Away with the idle notion (&s;ays another prophet) of &s;ucce&s;s in your Northern expedition!

<PB N="26" REF="27">if they are not condemned as <HI>prin|cipals,</HI> they may at lea&s;t be arraigned as active <HI>accomplices,</HI> in producing the calamity they foretell.</P>

<HEAD>ANNUAL PARLIAMENTS.</HEAD>
<P>IN the moment of mo&s;t general danger to the very exi&s;tence of a &s;tate, from a rebellion, and a foreign war, it becomes all wi&s;e, good, and prudent men, to devote their whole time to the concerting mea&s;ures, not to overcome the common enemy, but to new model and patch up the con&s;titution; ju&s;t as, in a clo&s;ely be&s;ieged town, every clever fellow &s;hould leave it to his inferiors to repell the a&s;&s;ailants from the walls, and bu&s;y him&s;elf, and his neighbours, in drawing plans to repair, and beautify the old town-hall, the a&s;&s;embly-rooms, and other build|ings of the city. And this, not from any paradoxical confu&s;ion, or ideal refinement, that the <HI>in&s;ide</HI> of the town is to all intents and purpo&s;es the <HI>out&s;ide;</HI> or that the &s;aid edifices are <HI>virtually</HI> the fortifications; but for a much &s;impler and more &s;ub&s;tantial rea&s;on; namely that the day of di&s;tre&s;s and danger is the true time to frighten the magi&s;trates into receiving their terms: which, if the
<PB N="29" REF="30">&s;iege is rai&s;ed, will &s;et them up for ever in fame and fortune; and if it be not, will &s;erve at lea&s;t to recommend them to the victorious enemy as very &s;hrewd and nota|ble projectors.</P>
<P>Now, in a &s;tate like ours, it is clear that the con&s;titution of parliament mu&s;t always form the grand &s;ubject of political theory. Hence various &s;chemes have been propound|ed, to purify, and refine it from all corrup|tions; and many tedious preparations, in the nature of chymical proce&s;&s;es, have been occa&s;ionally invented, to exalt it to what it really &s;hould be, a kind of compound elixir of popular &s;pirit.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the&s;e experiments, &s;ome profe&s;&s;ors in&s;i&s;ted, that its whole efficacy mu&s;t depend on the ingredients, that com|po&s;e it, being brought from their &s;everal native &s;oils, free of all charges.&mdash;Others held, that larger quantities of its mo&s;t whole&s;ome <HI>&s;imples,</HI> &s;hould be gathered out of the rich|e&s;t, and be&s;t cultivated lands, and not pick|ed up, like mu&s;hrooms, from old wa&s;tes
<PB N="30" REF="31">and barren commons. But, however com|po&s;ed, &s;ifted, and refined, &s;everal concurred in opinion, that it <HI>never</HI> could keep its &s;pirit above <HI>three</HI> years, becau&s;e formerly they only made it up for that time.</P>
<P>But the la&s;t, and far mo&s;t important di&s;|covery of all, is, that it never po&s;&s;ibly can be fit for u&s;e, or good for any thing at all, above a <HI>twelvemonth</HI> after it is fir&s;t put to|gether.&mdash;Or (to relea&s;e the metaphor be|fore it's quite exhau&s;ted) that annual parlia|ments are the grand arcanum, and &s;overeign panacea, for all the di&s;tempers of our de|cayed and peri&s;hing con&s;titution. And, in order to e&s;tabli&s;h this important point; fir&s;t, they affirm, that the virtue of that re&s;tricted duration beyond a triennial one, is very clearly proved by a conver&s;e ratio of the old homely adage, <HI>"There can never be too much of a good thing,"</HI> which, being inverted, very fairly carries the que&s;tion <HI>by three to one,</HI> again&s;t triennial in favour of annual parliaments&mdash;And next, the ingenious ad|vocates of this improvement, as clearly prove the undoubted <HI>u&s;e</HI> and <HI>plea&s;ure,</HI> that would

<HEAD>ANSWER.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is but little nece&s;&s;ity to con|&s;ider the fabulous allu&s;ions, and ideal parallels, of declamation. The legendary tale of Demagogues, had its u&s;e in the de|cline of Athenian freedom: but if its boa&s;ted hero had &s;urrendered to his wor&s;t and ba&s;e&s;t antagoni&s;t, without fighting, and, in a &s;hort time after, &s;ome happier hero had fought, and conquered the very &s;ame combatant; probably, no Grecian orator would after|wards have much in&s;i&s;ted on the vi&s;ionary &s;peculation of an army's being devoted to &s;acrifice an individual.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary to treat the latter part of this argument with &s;ome degree of &s;eriou&s;|ne&s;s and &s;olidity. Lea&s;t however too much time may appear to be wa&s;ted on it, it may be prudent to premi&s;e, that objections, founded on popular notions and prejudices, are ea&s;ily conveyed in few words, and, so
<PB N="40" REF="41">conveyed, make &s;trong impre&s;&s;ions; but whoever <HI>an&s;wers</HI> tho&s;e objections mu&s;t en|counter all the notions to which they are allied, and to which they owe their &s;trength; and it is well if any words find admittance to remove the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The appointment of party men to places of tru&s;t, and power, was indeed a very ha|zardous policy: it mu&s;t however be re|membered, that this <HI>policy</HI> was founded on a very liberal and generous hope, that, how|ever the forms of oppo&s;ition might be kept up, and even the technical licentiou&s;ne&s;s of debate per&s;evered in, yet that every man of honor, at &s;o awful a period, would dive&s;t him&s;elf of all the little prejudices and pa&s;|&s;ions of party, and feel his mind actua|ted by the noble&s;t impul&s;e, to &s;u&s;pend at lea&s;t all private re&s;entment, if not to form a truly glorious coalition, founded on public principle, and national honor.&mdash;Certain|ly the accompli&s;hment of &s;o noble a pur|po&s;e, would have been crowned with far different &s;ucce&s;s, from that which has ac|tually attended its attempt.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="42">But, to avoid the&s;e painful, and vain re|flections; in proceeding to an&s;wer the charge of <HI>violent and uncon&s;titutional di&s;mi&s;&s;ion,</HI> it mu&s;t fir&s;t be remembered that <HI>removals</HI> are not <HI>puni&s;hments.</HI>&mdash;It would be ab&s;urd to imagine, that a meer private prejudice in political mea&s;ures, however vague and fanci|full, or even pernicious in its tendency to the general welfare of the &s;tate, can become an object of <HI>penalty:</HI> But it is indeed a very different que&s;tion, with what propriety tho&s;e per&s;ons, who not only avow &s;uch opinions with the fond attachment of innovation, but al&s;o di&s;&s;eminate them with mo&s;t active zeal, &s;hould be continued in tho&s;e very &s;tations, which afford mo&s;t frequent and mo&s;t exten|&s;ive opportunities, to &s;pread them with all the weight of influence and authority.&mdash;And next, as to the <HI>right</HI> of di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, it is ob|vious that the &s;ame power, which <HI>appoints</HI> to offices, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily <HI>remove</HI> from them: both are exerci&s;es of that plain di&s;cretionary tru&s;t nece&s;&s;arily repo&s;ed in all governments, to the end that every delegation of their au|thority may be lodged in &s;uch hands as &s;hall &s;eem be&s;t affected to tho&s;e who employ
<PB N="42" REF="43">them.&mdash;Nor is this <HI>preventive policy</HI> of guarding again&s;t di&s;&s;affecton le&s;s congenial with the <HI>&s;pirit</HI> of our con&s;titution.&mdash;The prerogative of appointment to offices was originally unlimited; but, at the Re&s;toration, the parliament mo&s;t expre&s;sly declared the nece&s;&s;ity of guarding with jealous vigilance again&s;t the introduction of tho&s;e per&s;ons into places of <HI>power</HI> and <HI>tru&s;t,</HI> who&s;e opinions and prejudices rendered them dangerous &s;er|vants for the &s;tate to employ.</P>
<P>Hence the <HI>corporation</HI> and <HI>te&s;t acts;</HI> which (tho', at fir&s;t, they may &s;eem rather formed to guard the mitre, than the crown) were in fact, more really directed again&s;t the <HI>civil</HI> than the <HI>religious</HI> principles of the di&s;|&s;enters.</P>
<P>The&s;e di&s;abling &s;tatutes very clearly prove two points, both of which are material to this que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, that it is perfectly con&s;titutional to exerci&s;e the prerogative of appointment to
<PB N="43" REF="44">offices, with a &s;trict and cautious attention to the principles of tho&s;e who are to be em|ployed in them: and next, that in every other in&s;tance, except in the&s;e &s;tatutable di&s;quali|fications, this prerogative is entirely unlimi|ted, and ab&s;olutely di&s;cretionary; for it is plain, that the very re&s;triction in tho&s;e ex|cepted ca&s;es, virtually e&s;tabli&s;hes its inde|pendance in every other. But &s;o anxious were the re&s;toration parliament to remove all po&s;sibility of any future encroachment on the di&s;cretionary prerogative of militia ap|pointments, that an act was unanimou&s;ly pa&s;&s;ed, expre&s;&s;ive of the national abhorrence of that recent u&s;urpation of them, which had fatally given arms to innovation, and over|turned the con&s;titution, under the &s;pecious pretence of amending it.</P>
<P>By the &s;ame act al&s;o, it was directly decla|red, that tho&s;e very appointments had ever been, and for ever &s;hould continue, the unali|enable and uncontrouled right of the crown.</P>
<P>Such then being both the <HI>letter</HI> and the <HI>&s;pirit</HI> of the law on this point, it is but mere
<PB N="44" REF="45">matter of curio&s;ity, to con&s;ider the plain principles, on which this power is founded, both in <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>civil</HI> &s;ociety.</P>
<P>In the former, tho' all men were origi|nally on an equality, yet the di&s;tinction of abilities &s;et the fir&s;t bounds.&mdash;It required wi&s;dom and courage for council and arms&mdash;and it was nece&s;&s;ary of cour&s;e to exclude from each, &s;uch as were re&s;pectively defi|cient in either.</P>
<P>So far forth therefore there was a <HI>natural</HI> limitation.&mdash;But in <HI>civil</HI> &s;ociety it is equally important, in all delegations of power, to connect affection to the government, with the other leading qualifications; for (as has been too often proved) a courageous man, who hates his employers, is at lea&s;t as unfit to be tru&s;ted, as a coward; and wi&s;dom, connected with enmity, would only &s;erve to aggravate treachery in council.&mdash;The plain con&s;equence of which, is this; that either, no government has a right to pre&s;erve it&s;elf again&s;t the di&s;affection of a &s;ubject; or
<PB N="45" REF="46">el&s;e that every government has a right to ex|clude from offfices of power and tru&s;t, &s;uch as render them&s;elves &s;u&s;pected of di&s;affec|tion.</P>

It mu&s;t be remembered, that Admiral Graves &s;ailed after the French &s;quadron, and arrived at Rhode I&s;land, much about the &s;ame time as Mon&s;ieur De Ternay had been admitted there.

<P>Happy had it been for this country, if military wi&s;dom had been exerted, in this as in the la&s;t war, to ju&s;tify and immor|talize valour, not to depreciate atchieve|ments, which indeed are the deci&s;ive condemnation of tho&s;e who di&s;parage them.&mdash;If &s;uch a principle is once ad|mitted, that defeat and ruin will be our

<P>IN a mixed government like ours, public &s;peaking has a &s;ort of relative analogy to the compound &s;tructure of our con&s;ti|tution, and to the different orders of which it is compo&s;ed. Thus the highe&s;t, and mo&s;t exalted rank po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a proud pre-eminence of phra&s;eology, evidently characteri&s;tic of its &s;overeignty, and excellence: while the &s;econd degree, pre&s;erves a kind of equipoi&s;e in &s;tile; which, by a due mixture of digni|ty with plainne&s;s, denotes its intermediate balance, in the &s;cale of legi&s;lative eloquence.&mdash;But chiefly, in the third e&s;tate, it is pe|culiarly nece&s;&s;ary, that the &s;tream of rhe|toric &s;hould have certain particles of popu|larity, perpetually floating on its &s;urface, as te&s;timonies of the parent &s;ource, and foun|tain, from which it &s;prings.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="80">Upon this &s;y&s;tem, analogous principles might be formed, for the re&s;pective orato|ry of the &s;everal degrees&mdash;At pre&s;ent, however, a few documents only &s;hall be &s;ugge&s;ted for the particular application of this principle, to the rhetoric of the Hou&s;e of Commons; more e&s;pecially to that truly con&s;titutional part of it, occa&s;ionally ad|dre&s;&s;ed to the &s;trangers in the gallery; who&s;e "good report," as it is indeed "the brief and ab&s;tract <HI>chronicle</HI>" of parliamentary fame, it becomes peculiarly prudent, as well as honourable, to obtain.</P>
<P>In general then, as to the mode of exer|ci&s;ing this mi&s;cellaneous eloquence with mo&s;t ea&s;e and efficacy; it may be fairly laid down, that all eminent and projecting &s;en|tences; all pointed, and epigrammatic quib|bles; all metaphorical menaces; violent tropes; forced figures; and glaring orna|ments; are well calculated to rou&s;e the at|tention, and hitch upon the memory, of <HI>the gallery.</HI></P>

<P>But one of the more certain, and &s;ecure re&s;ources of mi&s;cellaneous rhetoric (and which I prefer mentioning, from its double illu&s;tration of precept and example,) is that conciliating re&s;pect, which &s;ome popular ora|tors more <HI>directly</HI> pay the <HI>gallery;</HI> in down|right acknowledgment of the <HI>"re&s;pectable appearance"</HI> of its company, on <HI>"important occa&s;ions."</HI></P>

And, in re&s;pect to the uniform re&s;i&s;tance to the principle of American &s;ubordination, the equally &s;elf-evident propo&s;ition mu&s;t al|ways be remembered "That to oppo&s;ition alone are we indebted, for that ab&s;olute and univer&s;al claim to it; THE DECLARATORY LAW."&mdash;Two mo&s;t trite refutations, of the two trite&s;t of all charges! which however as indi&s;putably di&s;prove the imputed de|linquency on the one &s;ide, as they ab&s;o|lutely overthrow the ridiculous claim to con&s;i&s;tency on the other.</P>
<P>But, with regard indeed to the great crite|rion of national opinion, <HI>the two popular elec|tions;</HI> certainly much &s;tre&s;s is wi&s;ely and ju&s;tly laid upon <HI>that</HI> point&mdash;nor would it prove an unplea&s;ing ta&s;k for &s;ome advocate of op|po&s;ition, to draw an exact parallel, in the
<PB N="97" REF="98">manner of Plutarch, between the <HI>four</HI> trium|phant candidates; wherein it would as evi|dently appear, that the <HI>two</HI> admirals, who &s;e|verally &s;hare the&s;e dome&s;tic honours, are not more preci&s;ely alike in principles and con|duct; than the two &s;tate&s;men al&s;o of the &s;ame elections, re&s;emble each other, in high birth, exalted genius, cultivated ta&s;te, &s;ound rea&s;oning, &s;trict honour, and <HI>undamped</HI> for|titude.&mdash;Which clo&s;e, and mathematical, con&s;ideration of the &s;everal relative pro|portions of merit, thus mutually com|pared, in their re&s;pective parallels, mu&s;t, not only demon&s;trate the exact corre&s;pon|dence of their reciprocal excellencies, and therefore, by fair con&s;equence, the truth, and ju&s;tice of declaring the&s;e two elec|tions a common, and equal &s;tandard of national opinion, but al&s;o at once overthrow every cavilling notion that may ari&s;e of their rediculous di&s;&s;imilitude, and e&s;tabli&s;h them, for the whole &s;ucceeding &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, as the great political parallel|logram of public &s;pirit.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="99">It may however be unnece&s;&s;ary to continue much longer the my&s;terious in&s;inuation of INFLUENCE, &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly circulated, preparatory to the&s;e boa&s;ted triumphs&mdash;at the moment, it might have been judicious, nay, po&s;&s;ibly, nece&s;&s;ary, to lean on this po|pular argument&mdash;But to continue it, might now appear unworthy the gallantry and &s;pirit of its author, if not too like the fret|ful re&s;ource of di&s;appointed pride.&mdash;When the tempe&s;t had di&s;&s;evered the good old ve&s;&s;el, de&s;pair might fly to any refuge.&mdash;The gilded lion at the head, was then no longer to be upheld, by romantic enthu|&s;ia&s;m, as the glittering &s;ign and &s;plendid pre&s;age of <HI>victory:</HI> di&s;tre&s;s and danger had de&s;troyed all fanciful re&s;pect; and exhau&s;|ted, &s;inking, &s;trength caught at that maje&s;tic ruin, which, faithfull even to its deba&s;er, elevated and &s;upported the very hand that &s;elfi&s;hly depre&s;&s;ed it.&mdash;It has had its u&s;e!&mdash;performed its &s;ervice!&mdash;Let it be no longer expo&s;ed, and dragged about, for low mockery and in&s;olent profanation; but generou&s;ly and gratefully <HI>laid up,</HI> like a vo|tive
<PB N="99" REF="100">tablet in the temple of Neptune, the con&s;ecrated record of unhoped-for refuge.</P>
<P>It remains only to &s;ay a few words on the la&s;t and powerful argument for the Change of Mini&s;try; namely, the deci&s;ive &s;uperi|ority of abilities, on the part of Oppo&s;ition&mdash;this favourite <HI>common place,</HI> &s;o perpetually, and &s;o mode&s;tly urged, might lead to per|&s;onal parallels, of all others the mo&s;t invi|dious, as well as di&s;putable.&mdash;On this que&s;tion, every man mu&s;t judge for him|&s;elf.&mdash;All that &s;hall be &s;aid here&mdash; is this; that it mu&s;t indeed be a much more infi|nite &s;uperiority of talent, than frequently occurs in the &s;cale of human under&s;tand|ing, that can, at once, render the qualifica|tions of any &s;et of men (who are compa|ratively unconver&s;ant with official bu&s;ine&s;s, or, at lea&s;t, not equally ver&s;ed of late years in political negociations, foreign, or dome&s;|tic;) &s;o &s;upremely &s;uperexcellent to tho&s;e of others, &s;ome of whom have been literally educated in office, others pa&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t part of their lives in foreign emba&s;&s;ies of
<PB N="100" REF="101">complicated concern, with the able&s;t, and pure&s;t reputation; and all are perfectly <HI>equal</HI> to their competitors in every advan|tage of rank and &s;ituation.&mdash;To this the thou&s;and declamatory common place re|plies of practi&s;ed fraud, veteran &s;ubtlety, and profe&s;&s;ional treachery, as they may be ea&s;ily imagined, &s;hall be &s;ilently de&s;pi&s;ed.&mdash;Certainly there are individuals in oppo|&s;ition, of mo&s;t exten&s;ive, and po&s;&s;ibly un|equalled under&s;tanding, the acce&s;&s;ion of who&s;e abilities would give lu&s;tre to public council, and be indeed almo&s;t a national ble&s;&s;ing.&mdash;But if the mi&s;erable appendages of party mu&s;t for ever fix their ponderous and oppre&s;&s;ive influence on talents formed for free, and bold a&s;piring; then may their perverted excellence be ju&s;tly pronounced the ruin of their country; and while, to vul|gar ob&s;ervation, this luminous and malig|nant prodigy, this &s;plendid, but baneful por|tent, &s;catters terror and amazement; by every more thinking mind, it will at once be wondered at, and lamented; admired, and deplored.&mdash;For pre-eminence of genius becomes doubly pernicious by the abu&s;e of
<PB N="101" REF="102">its own &s;uperiority, and the contaminating degradation of the faculties of others; and is indeed, both in effect, and by example,&mdash;The decay of a whole age.</P>
