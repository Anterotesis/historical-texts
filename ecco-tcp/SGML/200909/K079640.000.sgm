<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE very favourable manner, in which you &s;poke <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Gray's memoirs, p. 377.</NOTE> of &s;ome ob&s;ervations I &s;hewed you in MS. &s;everal years ago, <HI>On the lakes, and mountains of the northern parts of England,</HI> induced many of my friends, at different times, to de&s;ire the publication of them. But as they are illu&s;trated by a great variety of plans, and drawings, the hazard and expence had rather a formidable appear|ance.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="3">Your advice again&s;t a &s;ub&s;cription, I have con&s;idered; and am convinced, on weighing the matter, that without a&s;certaining a little better the difficulties of printing &s;o compli|cated a work, I &s;hould find my&s;elf embarra&s;&s;ed by an <HI>engagement with the public;</HI> and &s;hould infallibly injure either my &s;ub&s;cribers on one hand; or my&s;elf on the other.</P>
<P>I have followed your advice, you &s;ee, al&s;o in another point; and have made an e&s;&s;ay in a &s;maller work of the &s;ame kind; which may enable me the better to a&s;certain the expences of a larger.</P>
<P>I have cho&s;en the following little piece for that purpo&s;e; which was the fir&s;t of the kind I ever amu&s;ed my&s;elf with; and as it is very unimportant in it&s;elf, you will excu&s;e my endeavouring to give it &s;ome little credit by the following anecdote.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="4">In the &s;ame year, in which this journey was made, your late valuable friend Mr. Gray <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Gray's own account of this tour is contained in a letter, dated the 24th of May, 1771.
<Q>My la&s;t &s;ummer's tour was through Worce&s;ter&s;hire, Glo|ce&s;ter&s;hire, Monmouth&s;hire, Hereford&s;hire, and Shrop&s;hire, five of the mo&s;t beautiful counties in the kingdom. The very principal light, and capital feature of my journey, was the river Wye, which I de&s;cended in a boat for near 40 miles from Ro&s;s to Chep&s;tow. It's banks are a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of name|le&s;s beauties. One, out of many, you may &s;ee not ill-de&s;crib|ed by Mr. Whately, in his ob&s;ervations on gardening, un|der the name of the New-Weir. He has al&s;o touched on two others, Tintern-abbey, and Persfield; both of them famous &s;cenes; and both on the Wye. Monmouth, a town I never heard mentioned, lies on the &s;ame river; in a vale, that is the delight of my eyes, and the very &s;eat of plea&s;ure. The vale of Abergavenny, Ragland, and Chep&s;tow-ca&s;tles, Lud|low, Malvern-hills, &amp;c. were the re&s;t of my acqui&s;itions; and no bad harve&s;t in my opinion: but I made no journal my&s;elf; el&s;e you &s;hould have had it. I have indeed a &s;hort one, written by the companion of my travels, Mr. Nicholls, that &s;erves to recall, and fix the fleeting images of the&s;e things.</Q></NOTE> made it likewi&s;e; and hearing that I had put on paper a few remarks on the &s;cenes, which he had &s;o lately vi&s;ited, he de&s;ired a &s;ight of them. They were then only in a rude &s;tate; but the hand&s;ome things he &s;aid
<PB N="vi" REF="5">of them to a friend <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">William Fra&s;er <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> under-&s;ecretary of &s;tate.</NOTE> of his, who obligingly repeated them to me, gave them, I own, &s;ome little degree of credit in my own opinion; and make me &s;omewhat le&s;s appre|hen&s;ive in ri&s;king them before the public.</P>
<P>If this little work afforded any amu&s;ement to Mr. Gray, it was the amu&s;ement of a very late period of his life. He &s;aw it in London, about the beginning of June 1771; and he died, you know, at the end of the July fol|lowing.</P>
<P>Had he lived, it is po&s;&s;ible, he might have been induced to have a&s;&s;i&s;ted me with a few of his own remarks on &s;cenes, which he had &s;o accurately examined. The &s;lighte&s;t touches of &s;uch a ma&s;ter would have had their effect. No man was a greater admirer of nature, than Mr. Gray; nor admired it with better ta&s;te.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="6">I can only however offer this little work to the public, as a ha&s;ty &s;ketch. To criticize the face of a country correctly, you &s;hould &s;ee it oftener than once; and in various &s;ea&s;ons. Different circum&s;tances make &s;uch changes in the &s;ame land&s;cape, as give it wholly a new a&s;pect. But the&s;e &s;cenes are marked ju&s;t as they &s;truck the eye at fir&s;t. I had not an op|portunity to repeat the view.</P>
<P>For the drawings I mu&s;t apologize in the &s;ame manner. They were ha&s;tily &s;ketched; and under many di&s;advantages; and pretend at be&s;t to give only a general idea of a place, or &s;cene, without entring into the details of portrait.</P>
<P>Such as the work is, I print it by your advice; and it is chiefly from my deference to your opinion, and that of my other friends,
<PB N="viii" REF="7">that my expectation of any favour from the public is derived. I am, dear &s;ir, with great regard, and e&s;teem,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your mo&s;t obedient, and very &s;incere humble &s;ervant, WILLIAM GILPIN.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>POSTSCIPT to the &s;econd edition.</HEAD>
<P>In the fir&s;t edition of this work, the draw|ings were executed in a &s;tyle between etching with a needle, and aquatinta. In this edition, the latter mode only is employed. They are all executed by one hand, a very ingenious arti&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Jukes, in Howland Street.</NOTE>, who has done them I think, full ju&s;|tice. Many of the drawings he has much improved.</P>
<P>I do not my&s;elf throughly under&s;tand the proce&s;s of working in aquatinta; but the great inconvenience of it &s;eems to ari&s;e from it's
<PB N="ix" REF="8">not being &s;ufficiently under the arti&s;t's com|mand. It is not always able to give that ju&s;t gradation of light and &s;hade, which he de&s;ires. Har&s;h edges will &s;ometimes appear. It is however a very beautiful mode of mul|tiplying drawings; and certainly comes the neare&s;t of any mode we know, to the &s;oftne&s;s of the pencil. It may indeed literally be called <HI>drawing;</HI> as it wa&s;hes in the &s;hades. The only difference is, that it is a more unma|nageable proce&s;s to wa&s;h the &s;hades upon cop|per with aquafortis, than upon paper with a bru&s;h. If however the aquatinta mode of multiplying drawings hath &s;ome inconveni|ences, it is no more than every other mode of working on copper is &s;ubject to. Engrav|ing particularly is always accompanied with a degree of &s;tiffne&s;s.</P>
<P>For my&s;elf, I am fond of the free, rough &s;tile of etching land&s;cape with a needle, after the manner of Rembrandt; in which much is left to the imagination to make out. But this would not &s;atisfy the public; nor indeed
<PB N="x" REF="9">any one, who&s;e imagination is not &s;o conver|&s;ant with the &s;cenes of nature, as to make out a land&s;cape from a hint.&mdash;This rough mode hath at lea&s;t the advantage of biting the copper more &s;trongly; and giving a greater number of good impre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>To the fifteen drawings of the fir&s;t edition I was advi&s;ed to add two, as explanatory of the folding of the &s;ide-&s;creens of a circum|&s;cribed river<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 21.</NOTE>. The fir&s;t of the&s;e drawings is meant to illu&s;trate the&s;e &s;creens in their &s;im|ple&s;t form, when each con&s;i&s;ts only of one part. The &s;econd illu&s;trates the variation of them, when each con&s;i&s;ts of two parts, or more.</P>
<P>To the ob&s;ervations al&s;o of the fir&s;t edi|tion, a few are added; particularly the intire &s;ixth &s;ection; and a fuller de&s;cription of the vale of Severn in the fir&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON THE RIVER WYE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I.</HEAD>
<P>WE travel for various purpo&s;es&mdash;to explore the culture of &s;oils&mdash;to view the curio&s;ities of art&mdash;to &s;urvey the beauties of nature&mdash;and to learn the manners of men; their different polities, and modes of life.</P>
<P>The following little work propo&s;es a new object of pur&s;uit; that of examining the face of a country <HI>by the rules of picture&s;que beauty:</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="17">opening the &s;ources of tho&s;e plea&s;ures, which are derived from the compari&s;on.</P>
<P>Ob&s;ervations of this kind, through the vehicle of de&s;cription, have the better chance of being founded in truth; as they are not the offspring of theory; but are taken im|mediately from the &s;cenes of nature, as they ari&s;e.</P>
<P>Cro&s;&s;ing Houn&s;low-heath, from King&s;ton, in Surry, we &s;truck into the Reading-road and turned a little a&s;ide, to &s;ee the approach to Caver&s;ham-hou&s;e, which winds about a mile, along a valley, through the park. This was the work of Brown; who&s;e great merit lay in pur&s;uing the path, which nature had marked out. Nothing can be ea&s;ier, than the &s;weep; nor better united than the ground; nor more ornamental, than &s;everal of the clumps: but many of the &s;ingle trees, which are beeches, are heavy, and offend the eye. Almo&s;t any ordinary tree may contribute to form a group. It's deformities are lo&s;t in a crowd: nay, even the deformities of one tree may be corrected by the deformities of another. But few trees have tho&s;e characters of beauty,
<PB N="3" REF="18">which will enable them to appear with ad|vantage as individuals<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This approach to Caver&s;ham-hou&s;e, I have been informed, is now much injured.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>From lord Cadogan's we took the Wal|lingford-road to Oxford. It affords &s;ome variety, running along the declivity of a range of hills; and overlooking one of the vallies of the Thames. But there is nothing very intere&s;ting in the&s;e &s;cenes. The Thames appears; but only in &s;hort reaches. It rarely exceeds the dimen&s;ions of a pool; and does not once, as I remember, exhibit tho&s;e ample &s;weeps, in which the beauty of a river &s;o much con&s;i&s;ts. The woods too are frequent but they are formal cop&s;es: and white &s;pots, bur&s;ting every where from a chalky &s;oil, di&s;|turb the eye.</P>
<P>From Wallingford to Oxford, we did not ob&s;erve one good view, except at Shillingford; where the bridge, the river, and it's woody banks exhibit &s;ome &s;cenery.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="19">From Oxford we propo&s;ed to take the neare&s;t road to Ro&s;s. As far as Witney, the country appears flat, tho in fact it ri&s;es. About the eleventh &s;tone the high grounds command a noble &s;emicircular di&s;tance on the left; and near Burford there are views of the &s;ame kind, on the right; but not &s;o exten&s;ive. None of the&s;e land&s;capes however are per|fect, as they want the accompaniments of fore-grounds.</P>
<P>At Mr. Lenthal's, in Burford, we admired a capital picture of the family of the Mores, which is &s;aid to be Holbein's; and appeared to us intirely in that ma&s;ter's &s;tyle. But Mr. Walpole thinks it is not an original; and &s;ays he found a date upon it, &s;ub&s;equent to the death of that ma&s;ter. It is however a good picture of it's kind. It contains eleven figures&mdash;Sir Thomas More, and his father; two young ladies, and other branches of the family. The heads are as expre&s;&s;ive, as the compo&s;ition is formal. The judge is marked with the character of a dry, facetious, &s;en&s;ible,
<PB N="5" REF="20">old man. The chancellor is handed down to us in hi&s;tory, both as a chearful philo&s;opher; and as a &s;evere inqui&s;itor. His countenance here has much of that eagerne&s;s, and &s;tern attention, which remind us of the latter. The &s;ubject of this piece &s;eems to be a di&s;|pute between the two young ladies; and alludes probably to &s;ome well-known family &s;tory.</P>
<P>Indeed every family-picture &s;hould be found|ed on &s;ome little &s;tory, or dome&s;tic incident, which, in a degree, &s;hould engage the at|tention of all the figures. It would be in|vidious perhaps to tax Vandyck on this head: but if the truth might be &s;poken, I could mention &s;ome of his family pictures, which, if the &s;weetne&s;s of his colouring, and the elegant &s;implicity of his airs, and attitudes, did not make us forget all faults, would ap|pear only like &s;o many di&s;tinct portraits, &s;tuck together on the &s;ame canvas. It would be equally invidious to omit mentioning a modern ma&s;ter, now at the head of his profe&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds.</NOTE>, who&s;e great fertility of invention in <HI>employing</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="21">the figures of his family-pictures, is not among the lea&s;t of his many excellences.</P>
<P>The country from Burford is high, and downy. A valley, on the right, kept pace with us; through which flows the Windru&s;h; not indeed an object of &s;ight; but ea&s;ily traced along the meadows by pollard-willows, and a more luxuriant vegetation.</P>
<P>At Barrington we had a plea&s;ing view, through an opening on the foreground.</P>
<P>About North-leach the road grows very di&s;agreeable. Nothing appears, but downs on each &s;ide; and the&s;e often divided by &s;tone walls, the mo&s;t offen&s;ive &s;eparation of pro|perty.</P>
<P>From the neighbourhood of London, we had now pur&s;ued our journey through a tract of country, almo&s;t uniformly ri&s;ing, tho by im|perceptible degrees, into the heart of Gloce&s;|ter&s;hire;
<PB N="7" REF="22">till at length we found our&s;elves on the ridge of Cote&s;wold.</P>
<P>The county of Gloce&s;ter is divided into three capital parts&mdash;the Wolds, or high downy grounds towards the ea&s;t&mdash;the vale of Severn in the middle&mdash;and the fore&s;t of Dean, towards the we&s;t. The fir&s;t of the&s;e tracts of country we had been traver&s;ing from our entrance into Gloce&s;ter&s;hire: and the ridge we now &s;tood on, made the extremity of it. Here the heights which we had been a&s;cending by &s;uch imper|ceptible degrees, that we hardly ever perceived the a&s;cent, at length broke down abruptly into the lower grounds; and a va&s;t &s;tretch of di&s;tant country appeared at once before the eye.</P>
<P>I know not that I was ever more &s;truck with the &s;ingularity, and grandeur of any land&s;cape. Nature generally brings different countries together in &s;ome ea&s;y mode of connection. If &s;he rai&s;e the grounds on one &s;ide by a long a&s;cent, &s;he commonly unites them with the country on the other, in the &s;ame ea&s;y manner. Such &s;cenes we view without wonder, or emotion. We glide without ob&s;ervation, from the near grounds into the more di&s;tant. All is gradual, and ea&s;y. But when nature works in the bold, and &s;ingular &s;tile of compo&s;ition,
<PB N="8" REF="23">in which &s;he works here&mdash;when &s;he rai&s;es a country through a progre&s;s of a hundred miles; and then breaks it down at once by an abrupt precipice into an expan&s;ive vale, we are im|mediately &s;truck with the novelty, and grandeur of the &s;cene.</P>
<P>It was the vale of Severn, which was &s;pread before us. Perhaps no where in England a di&s;tance &s;o rich, and at the &s;ame time &s;o exten|&s;ive, can be found. We had a view of it almo&s;t from one end to the other; winding through the &s;pace of many leagues in a direction nearly from we&s;t to north. The eye was lo&s;t in the profu&s;ion of objects, which were thrown at once before it; and ran wild, as it were, over the va&s;t expan&s;e, with rapture, and a&s;toni&s;h|ment, before it could compo&s;e it&s;elf enough to make any coherent ob&s;ervations.&mdash;At length we begin to examine the detail; and to &s;eparate the va&s;t immen&s;ity before us into parts.</P>
<P>To the north, we looked up the vale, along the cour&s;e of the Severn. The town of Chel|tenham lay below our feet, at the di&s;tance of two or three miles. The vale appeared af|terwards confined between the limits of Bre|don hills, on the right; and tho&s;e of Malvern on the left. Right between the&s;e in the mid|dle
<PB N="9" REF="24">of the vale lies Tewk&s;bury, bo&s;omed in wood; the great church even at this di&s;tance makes a re&s;pectable appearance. A little to the right, but in di&s;tance very remote, we may &s;ee the towers of Worce&s;ter, if the day be clear; e&s;pecially if &s;ome accidental gleam of light relieve them from the hills of Shrop|&s;hire, which clo&s;e the &s;cene.</P>
<P>To the we&s;t, we look toward Gloce&s;ter. And here it is remarkable, that as the objects in the northern part of the vale are confined by the hills of Malvern, and Bredon, &s;o in this view the vale is confined by two other hills; which tho incon&s;iderable in them&s;elves, give a character to the &s;cene; and the more &s;o as they are both in&s;ulated. One of the&s;e hills is known by the name of Robin's-wood; the other by that of Church-down, from the &s;ingularity of a church &s;eated on it's emi|nence. Between the&s;e hills the great object of the vale, is the city of Gloce&s;ter; which appears ri&s;ing over rich woody &s;cenes. Be|yond Gloce&s;ter the eye &s;till pur&s;ues the vale into remote di&s;tance, till it unite with a range of mountains.</P>
<P>Still more to the we&s;t ari&s;es a di&s;tant fore&s;t-view, compo&s;ed of the woods of the country
<PB N="10" REF="25">uniting with the fore&s;t of Dean. Of this view the principal feature is the mouth of the Severn, where it fir&s;t begins to a&s;&s;ume a character of grandeur by mixing with the ocean. A &s;mall portion only of it is &s;een &s;tretching in an acute angle over the wood. But the eye, u&s;ed to per&s;pective, &s;eeing &s;uch a body of water, &s;mall as it appears, wearing any <HI>determined form</HI> at &s;uch di&s;tance, gives it cre|dit for it's full magnitude. The Welch mountains al&s;o, which ri&s;e beyond the Severn, contribute to rai&s;e the idea: for by forming an even horizontal line along the edge of the water, they give it the appearance of what it really is, an arm of the &s;ea.</P>
<P>Having thus taken a view of the va&s;t expan&s;e of the vale of Severn from the extremity of the de&s;cent of Cote&s;wold; we had lei&s;ure next to examine the grandeur of the de&s;cent it|&s;elf; which forms a foreground not le&s;s ad|mirable than the di&s;tance. The lofty ridge, on which we &s;tood, is of great extent; &s;tretch|ing beyond the bounds of Gloce&s;ter&s;hire, both towards the north, and towards the &s;outh. It is not every where, we may &s;uppo&s;e, of
<PB N="11" REF="26">equal beauty, height, and abruptne&s;s: but fine pa&s;&s;ages of land&s;cape, I have been told, abound in every part of it. The &s;pot where we took this view, over the vale of Severn, is the high ground on Crickly-hill; which is a promontory &s;tanding out in the vale, be|tween the villages of Leckhampton, and Bird|lip. Here the de&s;cent con&s;i&s;ts of various rocky knolls, prominences, and abruptne&s;&s;es; among which a variety of roads wind down the &s;teep towards different parts of the vale; and each of the&s;e roads, through it's whole varying progre&s;s, exhibits &s;ome beautiful view; di&s;covering the vale either in whole, or in part, with every advantage of a picture&s;que foreground.</P>
<P>Many of the&s;e precipices al&s;o are finely wooded. Some of the large&s;t trees in the kingdom perhaps are to be &s;een in the&s;e parts. The Cheltenham oak, and an elm, not far from it, are trees, which curious travellers always inquire after.</P>
<P>Many of the&s;e hills, which inclo&s;e the vale of Severn, on this &s;ide, furni&s;h land&s;capes them&s;elves, without borrowing a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the vale. The woody vallies, which run wind|ing among them, pre&s;ent many plea&s;ing pa&s;|toral
<PB N="12" REF="27">&s;cenes. The cloathing country about Stroud, is particularly diver&s;ified in this way: tho many of the&s;e vallies are greatly injured in a picture&s;que light, by becoming &s;cenes of habitation, and indu&s;try. A cottage, a mill, or a hamlet among trees, may often add beauty to a rural &s;cene: but when hou&s;es are &s;cattered through every part, the moral &s;en&s;e can never make a convert of the pic|ture&s;que eye. Stroud-water valley e&s;pecially, which is one of the mo&s;t beautiful of the&s;e &s;cenes, has been deformed lately not only by a number of buildings, but by a canal, cut through the middle of it.</P>
<P>Among the curio&s;ities of the&s;e high grounds, is the &s;even-well-head of the Thames. In a glen near the road, a few limpid &s;prings, gu&s;h|ing from a rock, give origin to this noble&s;t of Engli&s;h rivers; tho I &s;uppo&s;e &s;everal little &s;treams, in that di&s;trict, might claim the honour with equal ju&s;tice, if they could bring over opinion.</P>
<P>Nothing can give a &s;tronger idea of the nature of the country I have been de&s;cribing, than this circum&s;tance of it's giving ri&s;e to the Thames. On one &s;ide, within half a dozen miles below the precipice, the Severn
<PB N="13" REF="28">has arrived at &s;o much con&s;equence, as to take it's level from the tides of the ocean: on the other, the Thames ari&s;ing at our feet, does not arrive at that dignity, till it have performed a cour&s;e of two hundred and fifty miles.</P>
<P>Having de&s;cended the heights of Crickley, the road, through the vale continues &s;o level to Gloce&s;ter, that we &s;carce &s;aw the town, till we entered it.</P>
<P>The cathedral is of elegant Gothic on the out&s;ide, but of heavy Saxon within: that is, the&s;e different modes of architecture <HI>prevail mo&s;t</HI> in the&s;e different parts of the building. But in fact, the cathedral of Gloce&s;ter is a compound of all the &s;everal modes, which have prevailed from the days of Henry the &s;econd to tho&s;e of Henry the &s;eventh, and may be &s;aid to include, in one part or other, the whole hi&s;tory of &s;acred architecture during that period. Many parts of it have been built in the times of the pure&s;t Gothic: and others, which have been originally Saxon, ap|pear plainly to have been altered into the Gothic; which was no uncommon practice.
<PB N="14" REF="29">A Grecian &s;creen is injudiciou&s;ly introduced to &s;eparate the choir. The cloi&s;ters are light and airy.</P>
<P>As we leave the gates of Gloce&s;ter, the view is plea&s;ing. A long &s;tretch of meadow, filled with cattle, &s;preads into a foreground. Be|yond, is a &s;creen of wood, terminated by di&s;|tant mountains; among which Malvern-hills make a re&s;pectable appearance. The road to Ro&s;s, leads through a country, woody, rough, hilly, and picture&s;que.</P>
<P>Ro&s;s &s;tands high, and commands many di&s;tant views; but that from the church-yard is the mo&s;t admired; and is indeed very amu|&s;ing. It con&s;i&s;ts of an ea&s;y &s;weep of the Wye; and of an exten&s;ive country beyond it. But it is not picture&s;que. It is marked by no characteri&s;tic objects: it is broken into too many parts; and it is &s;een from too high a point. The &s;pire of the church, which is the man of Ro&s;s's <HI>heaven-directed &s;pire,</HI> tapers beautifully. The inn, which was the

<P>THE WYE takes it's ri&s;e near the &s;ummit of Plinlimmon; and dividing the coun|ties of Radnor, and Brecknoc, pa&s;&s;es through the middle of Hereford&s;hire. From thence becoming a &s;econd boundary between Mon|mouth, and Gloce&s;ter&s;hire, it falls into the Severn, a little below Chep&s;tow. To this place from Ro&s;s, which is a cour&s;e of near forty miles, it flows in a gentle, uninterrupt|ed &s;tream; and adorns, through it's various reaches, a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t picture&s;que &s;cenes.</P>
<P>The beauty of the&s;e &s;cenes ari&s;es chiefly from two circum&s;tances&mdash;the <HI>lofty banks</HI> of the river, and it's <HI>mazy cour&s;e;</HI> both which are accurately ob&s;erved by the poet, when he de&s;cribes the Wye, as <HI>ecchoing</HI> through it's
<PB N="18" REF="33"><HI>winding</HI> bounds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><L>Pleas'd Vaga ecchoes thro' it's winding bounds,</L>
<L>And rapid Severn hoar&s;e applau&s;e re&s;ounds.</L>
<P>Pope's Eth. Ep.</P></NOTE>. It could not well <HI>eccho,</HI> unle&s;s it's banks were both <HI>lofty</HI> and <HI>winding.</HI></P>
<P>From the&s;e two circum&s;tances the views it exhibits, are of the mo&s;t beautiful kind of per&s;pective; free from the formality of lines.</P>
<P>Every view on a river, thus circum&s;tanced, is compo&s;ed of four grand parts; the <HI>area,</HI> which is the river it&s;elf; the <HI>two &s;ide-&s;creens,</HI> which are the oppo&s;ite banks, and mark the per&s;pective; and the <HI>front-&s;creen,</HI> which points out the winding of the river.</P>
<P>If the Wye ran, like a Dutch canal, be|tween parallel banks there could be no front-&s;creen: the two &s;ide-&s;creens, in that &s;ituation, would lengthen to a point.</P>
<P>If a road were under the circum&s;tance of a river winding like the Wye, the effect would be the &s;ame. But this is rarely the ca&s;e. The road pur&s;ues the irregularity of the coun|try. It climbs the hill; and &s;inks into the
<PB N="19" REF="34">valley: and this irregularity gives the view it exhibits, a different character.</P>
<P>The views on the Wye, tho compo&s;ed only of the&s;e <HI>&s;imple parts,</HI> are yet <HI>infinitely varied.</HI></P>
<P>They are varied, fir&s;t, by the <HI>contra&s;t of the &s;creens.</HI> Sometimes one of the &s;ide-&s;creens is elevated; &s;ometimes the other; and &s;ometimes the front. Or both the &s;ide-&s;creens may be lofty; and the front either high, or low.</P>
<P>Again, they are varied by the <HI>folding of the &s;ide-&s;creens over each other;</HI> and hiding more or le&s;s of the front. When none of the front is di&s;covered, the folding-&s;ide either winds round, like an amphitheatre<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The word <HI>amphitheatre,</HI> &s;trictly &s;peaking, is a complete inclo&s;ure: but, I believe, it is commonly accepted, as here, for any circular piece of architecture, tho it do not wind <HI>en|tirely</HI> round.</NOTE>; or it becomes a long reach of per&s;pective.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="35">The&s;e <HI>&s;imple</HI> variations admit &s;till farther variety from becoming <HI>complex.</HI> One of the &s;ides may be compounded of various parts; while the other remains &s;imple: or both may be compounded; and the front &s;imple: or the front alone may be compounded.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e &s;ources of variety, there are other circum&s;tances, which, under the name of <HI>ornaments,</HI> &s;till farther increa&s;e them. <HI>Plain</HI> banks will admit all the variations we have yet mentioned: but when this <HI>plainne&s;s</HI> is <HI>adorned,</HI> a thou&s;and other varieties ari&s;e.</P>
<P>The <HI>ornaments</HI> of the Wye may be ranged under four heads&mdash;<HI>ground</HI>&mdash;<HI>wood</HI>&mdash;<HI>rocks</HI>&mdash;and <HI>buildings.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>ground,</HI> of which the banks of the Wye con&s;i&s;t, (and which hath thus far been con&s;idered only in it's <HI>general effect,</HI>) affords every variety, which ground is capable of receiving; from the &s;teepe&s;t precipice, to the flatte&s;t meadow. This variety appears in the
<PB REF="36"><FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB REF="37"><FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="21" REF="38">line formed by the &s;ummits of the banks; in the &s;wellings, and excavations of their decli|vities; and in the unequal &s;urfaces of the lower grounds.</P>
<P>In many places al&s;o the ground is <HI>broken;</HI> which adds new &s;ources of variety. By <HI>broken ground,</HI> we mean only &s;uch ground, as hath lo&s;t it's turf, and dicovers the naked &s;oil. Often you &s;ee a gravelly earth &s;hivering from the hills, in the form of water-falls: or per|haps you &s;ee dry, &s;tony channels, guttering down precipices; the rough beds of temporary torrents: and &s;ometimes &s;o trifling a cau&s;e, as the rubbing of &s;heep again&s;t the &s;ides of little banks, or hillocs, will often occa&s;ion very beautiful breaks.</P>
<P>The <HI>colour</HI> too of the broken &s;oil is a great &s;ource of variety, the yellow, or the red oker; the a&s;hy grey; the black earth; or the marley blue. And the intermixtures of the&s;e with each other, and with patches of verdure, blooming heath, and other vegetable tints, &s;till increa&s;e that variety.</P>
<P>Nor let the fa&s;tidious reader think, the&s;e remarks de&s;cend too much into detail. Were an exten&s;ive di&s;tance de&s;cribed, a fore&s;t-&s;cene, a &s;ea coa&s;t view, a va&s;t &s;emicircular range of
<PB N="22" REF="39">mountains, or &s;ome other grand di&s;play of nature, it would be trifling to mark the&s;e minute circum&s;tances. But here the hills around exhibit little, except <HI>foregrounds;</HI> and it is nece&s;&s;ary, where we have no di&s;tances, to be more exact in fini&s;hing objects at hand.</P>
<P>The next great ornament on the banks of the Wye, are it's <HI>woods.</HI> In this country there are many works carried on by fire; and the woods being maintained for their u&s;e, are periodically cut down. As the larger trees are generally left, a kind of alternacy takes place: what is, this year, a thicket; may, the next, be an open grove. The woods them&s;elves po&s;&s;e&s;s little beauty, and le&s;s gran|deur; yet, when we con&s;ider them as the <HI>ornamental,</HI> not as the <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> parts, of a &s;cene; the eye mu&s;t not examine them with exactne&s;s; but compound for a <HI>general effect.</HI></P>
<P>One circum&s;tance, attending this alternacy, is plea&s;ing. Many of the furnaces, on the banks of the river, con&s;ume charcoal, which is manufactured on the &s;pot; and the &s;moke, which is frequently &s;een i&s;&s;uing from the &s;ides of the hills; and &s;preading it's thin veil over
<PB N="23" REF="40">a part of them, beautifully breaks their lines, and unites them with the &s;ky.</P>
<P>The chief deficiency, in point of wood, is of large trees on the <HI>edge of the water;</HI> which, clumped here and there, would di|ver&s;ify the hills, as the eye pa&s;&s;es them; and remove that heavine&s;s, which always, in &s;ome degree, (tho here as little as any where) ari&s;es from the continuity of ground. They would al&s;o give a degree of di&s;tance to the more removed parts; which in a &s;cene like this, would be attended with peculiar advantage: for as we have here &s;o little di&s;tance, we wi&s;h to make the mo&s;t of what we have.&mdash;But trees <HI>immediately on the foreground</HI> cannot be &s;uffered in the&s;e &s;cenes; as they would ob&s;truct the navigation of the river.</P>
<P>The <HI>rocks,</HI> which are continually &s;tarting through the woods, produce another <HI>ornament</HI> on the banks of the Wye. The rock, as all other objects, tho more than all, receives it's chief beauty from contra&s;t. Some objects, are beautiful in them&s;elves. The eye is plea&s;ed with the tuftings of a tree: it is amu&s;ed with pur&s;uing the eddying &s;tream; or it re&s;ts with
<PB N="24" REF="41">delight on the &s;hattered arches of a Gothic ruin. Such objects, independent of compo|&s;ition, are beautiful in them&s;elves. But the rock, bleak, naked, and unadorned, &s;eems &s;carcely to de&s;erve a place among them. Tint it with mo&s;&s;es, and lychens of various hues, and you give it a degree of beauty. Adorn it with &s;hrubs and hanging herbage, and you &s;till make it more picture&s;que. Connect it with wood, and water, and broken ground; and you make it in the highe&s;t degree inter|e&s;ting. It's <HI>colour,</HI> and it's <HI>form</HI> are &s;o accom|modating, that it generally blends into one of the mo&s;t beautiful appendages of land&s;cape.</P>
<P>Different kinds of rocks have different de|grees of beauty. Tho&s;e on the Wye, which are of a greyi&s;h colour, are in general, &s;imple, and grand; rarely formal, or fanta&s;tic. Some|times they project in tho&s;e beautiful &s;quare ma&s;&s;es, yet broken and &s;hattered in every line, which is characteri&s;tic of the mo&s;t maje&s;tic &s;pecies of rock. Sometimes they &s;lant obliquely from the eye in &s;helving dia|gonal &s;trata: and &s;ometimes they appear in large ma&s;&s;es of &s;mooth &s;tone, detached from each other, and half buried in the &s;oil. Rocks
<PB N="25" REF="42">of this la&s;t kind are the mo&s;t lumpi&s;h, and the lea&s;t picture&s;que.</P>
<P>The various <HI>buildings,</HI> which ari&s;e every where on the banks of the Wye, form the la&s;t of it's <HI>ornaments;</HI> abbeys, ca&s;tles, villages, &s;pires, forges, mills, and bridges. One or other of the&s;e venerable ve&s;tiges of pa&s;t, or cheerful habitations of pre&s;ent times, cha|racterize almo&s;t every &s;cene.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>works of art</HI> are however of much greater u&s;e in <HI>artificial,</HI> than in <HI>natural</HI> land|&s;cape. In pur&s;uing the beauties of nature, we range at large among fore&s;ts, lakes, rocks, and mountains. The various &s;cenes we meet with, furni&s;h an inexhau&s;ted &s;ource of plea|&s;ure. And tho the works of art may often give animation and contra&s;t to the&s;e &s;cenes; yet &s;till they are not nece&s;&s;ary. We can be amu&s;ed without them. But when we intro|duce a &s;cene on canvas&mdash;when the eye is to be confined within the frame of a picture, and can no longer range among the varieties of nature; the aids of art become more ne|ce&s;&s;ary; and we want the ca&s;tle, or the
<PB N="26" REF="43">abbey, to give con&s;equence to the &s;cene. In|deed the land&s;cape-painter &s;eldom thinks his view perfect, without characterizing it by &s;ome object of this kind.</P>

<P>HAVING thus analyzed the Wye, and con&s;idered &s;eparately it's con&s;tituent parts&mdash;the <HI>&s;teepne&s;s</HI> of it's banks&mdash;it's <HI>mazy</HI> cour&s;e&mdash;the <HI>ground, woods,</HI> and <HI>rocks,</HI> which are it's native ornaments&mdash;and the <HI>buildings,</HI> which &s;till farther adorn it's natural beauties; we &s;hall now take a view of &s;ome of tho&s;e delightful &s;cenes, which re&s;ult from the <HI>com|bination</HI> of all the&s;e picture&s;que materials.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t however premi&s;e, how ill-qualified I am to do ju&s;tice to the banks of the Wye, were it only from having &s;een them under the circum&s;tance of a continued rain; which began early in the day, before one third of our voyage was performed.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="45">It is true, &s;cenery <HI>at hand</HI> &s;uffers le&s;s under &s;uch a circum&s;tance, than &s;cenery at <HI>a di&s;tance;</HI> which it totally ob&s;cures.</P>
<P>The picture&s;que eye al&s;o, in que&s;t of beauty, finds it almo&s;t in every incident, and under every appearance of nature. Her works, and all her works, mu&s;t ever, in &s;ome degree, be beautiful. Even the rain gave a gloomy grandeur to many of the &s;cenes; and by throwing a veil of ob&s;curity over the removed banks of the river, introduced, now and then, &s;omething like a plea&s;ing di&s;tance. Yet &s;till it hid greater beauties; and we could not help regretting the lo&s;s of tho&s;e broad lights, and deep &s;hadows, which would have given &s;o much lu&s;tre to the whole; and which, ground like this, is, in a peculiar manner, adapted to receive.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t part of the river from Ro&s;s, is tame. The banks are low; and there is &s;carce an object worth attention, except the ruins of <HI>Wilton-ca&s;tle,</HI> which appear on the left, &s;hrouded with a few trees. But the &s;cene wants accompaniments to give it gran|deur.</P>
<P><PB REF="46"><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="47">The bank however &s;oon began to &s;well on the right, and was richly adorned with wood. We admired it much; and al&s;o the vivid images reflected from the water; which were continually di&s;turbed, as we &s;ailed pa&s;t them; and thrown into tremulous confu&s;ion, by the da&s;hing of our oars. A di&s;turbed &s;urface of water endeavouring to collect it's &s;cattered images; and re&s;tore them to order, is among the <HI>pretty</HI> appearances of nature.</P>
<P>We met with nothing, for &s;ome time, du|ring our voyage, but the&s;e grand woody banks, one ri&s;ing behind another; appearing, and vani&s;hing, by turns, as we doubled the &s;everal capes. But tho no particular objects marked and characterized the&s;e different &s;cenes; yet they afforded great variety of beautiful per|&s;pective views, as we wound round them; or &s;tretched through the reaches, which they marked along the river.</P>
<P>The channel of no river can be more de|ci&s;ively marked, than that of the Wye. <HI>Who
<PB N="30" REF="48">hath divided a water-cour&s;e for the flowing of rivers?</HI> &s;aith the Almighty in that grand apo&s;trophe to Job on the works of creation. The idea is happily illu&s;trated here. A nobler <HI>water-cour&s;e</HI> was never <HI>divided</HI> for any river, than this of the Wye. Rivers, in general, pur&s;ue a devious cour&s;e along the countries, through which they flow; and form channels for them&s;elves by con&s;tant fluxion. But &s;ome|times, as in the&s;e &s;cenes, we &s;ee a channel marked with &s;uch preci&s;ion; that it appears as if originally intended only for the bed of a river.</P>
<P>After &s;ailing four miles from Ro&s;s, we came to <HI>Goodrich-ca&s;tle;</HI> where a grand view pre&s;ented it&s;elf; and we re&s;ted on our oars to examine it. A reach of the river, forming a noble bay, is &s;pread before the eye. The bank, on the right, is &s;teep, and covered with wood; beyond which a bold promon|tory &s;hoots out, crowned with a ca&s;tle, ri&s;ing among trees.</P>
<P>This view, which is one of the grande&s;t on the river, I &s;hould not &s;cruple to call
<PB REF="49"><FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="31" REF="50"><HI>correctly picture&s;que;</HI> which is &s;eldom the cha|racter of a purely natural &s;cene.</P>
<P>Nature is always great in de&s;ign. She is an admirable colouri&s;t al&s;o; and harmonizes tints with infinite variety, and beauty. But &s;he is &s;eldom &s;o correct in compo&s;ition, as to produce an harmonious whole. Either the foreground, or the background, is di&s;propor|tioned: or &s;ome awkward line runs acro&s;s the piece: or a tree is ill-placed: or a bank is formal: or &s;omething or other is not exactly what it &s;hould be. The ca&s;e is, the immen|&s;ity of nature is beyond human comprehen&s;ion. She works on a <HI>va&s;t &s;cale;</HI> and, no doubt, harmoniou&s;ly, if her &s;chemes could be com|prehended. The arti&s;t, in the mean time, is confined to a <HI>&s;pan;</HI> and lays down his little rules, which he calls the <HI>principles of picture&s;que beauty,</HI> merely to adapt &s;uch dimi|nutive parts of nature's &s;urfaces to his own eye, as come within it's &s;cope.</P>
<P>Hence therefore, the painter, who adheres &s;trictly to the <HI>compo&s;ition</HI> of nature, will rarely make a good picture. His picture mu&s;t con|tain <HI>a whole:</HI> his archetype is but <HI>a part.</HI></P>
<P>In general however he may obtain views of &s;uch parts of nature, as with the addition
<PB N="32" REF="51">of a few trees; or a little alteration in the foreground, (which is a liberty, that mu&s;t always be allowed) may be adapted to his rules; though he is rarely &s;o fortunate as to find a land&s;cape completely &s;atisfactory to him. In the &s;cenery indeed at Goodrich-ca&s;tle the parts are few; and the whole is a very &s;imple exhibition. The complex &s;cenes of nature are generally tho&s;e, which the arti&s;t finds mo&s;t refractory to his rules of compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>In following the cour&s;e of the Wye, which makes here one of it's bolde&s;t &s;weeps, we were carried almo&s;t round the ca&s;tle, &s;urveying it in a variety of forms. Many of the&s;e re|tro&s;pects are good; but, in general, the ca&s;tle lo&s;es, on this &s;ide, both it's own dignity, and the dignity of it's &s;ituation.</P>
<P>The views <HI>from</HI> the ca&s;tle, were mentioned to us, as worth examining: but the rain was now &s;et in, and would not permit us to land.</P>
<P>As we leave <HI>Goodrich-ca&s;tle,</HI> the banks, on the left, which had hitherto contributed le&s;s
<PB N="33" REF="52">to entertain us, began now principally to attract our attention; rearing them&s;elves gra|dually into grand &s;teeps; &s;ometimes covered with thick woods; and &s;ometimes forming va&s;t concave &s;lopes of mere verdure; unadorned, except here and there, by a &s;traggling tree: while the flocks, which hung browzing upon them, &s;een from the bottom, were dimini&s;hed into white &s;pecks.</P>
<P>The view at <HI>Rure-dean-church</HI> unfolds it&s;elf next; which is a &s;cene of great grandeur. Here, both &s;ides of the river are &s;teep, and both woody; but in one the woods are in|termixed with rocks. The deep umbrage of the fore&s;t of Dean occupies the front; and the &s;pire of the church ri&s;es among the trees. The reach of the river, which exhibits this &s;cene, is long; and, of cour&s;e, the view, which is a noble piece of natural per&s;pective, continues &s;ome time before the eye: but when the &s;pire comes directly in front, the grandeur of the land&s;cape is gone.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="53">The <HI>&s;tone-quarries,</HI> on the right, from which the bridge of Bri&s;tol was built; and, on the left, the furnaces of <HI>Bi&s;hop's-wood,</HI> vary the &s;cene, tho they are objects of no great importance in them&s;elves.</P>
<P>For &s;ome time, both &s;ides of the river continue &s;teep and beautiful. No particular object indeed characterizes either: but here nature characterizes her own &s;cenes. We admire the infinite <HI>variety,</HI> with which &s;he <HI>&s;hapes,</HI> and <HI>adorns,</HI> the&s;e va&s;t concave, and convex forms. We admire al&s;o that <HI>varied touch,</HI> with which &s;he expre&s;&s;es every object.</P>
<P>Here we &s;ee one great di&s;tinction between <HI>her</HI> painting, and that of all her <HI>copyi&s;ts.</HI> Arti&s;ts univer&s;ally are <HI>manneri&s;ts</HI> in a certain degree. Each has his particular mode of forming particular objects. His rocks, his trees, his figures are ca&s;t in one mould: at lea&s;t they po&s;&s;e&s;s only a <HI>varied &s;amene&s;s.</HI> Ruben's figures are all full-fed: Salvator's, &s;pare, and long-legged.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="54">The arti&s;t al&s;o di&s;covers as little variety in filling up the &s;urfaces of bodies, as he does in delineating their forms. You &s;ee the &s;ame <HI>touch,</HI> or &s;omething like it, univer&s;ally prevail; tho applied to different &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>In every part of painting except execution, an arti&s;t may be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the labours of tho&s;e, who have gone before him. He may improve his &s;kill in compo&s;ition&mdash;in light and &s;hade&mdash;in per&s;pective&mdash;in grace and ele|gance; that is, in all the &s;cientific parts of his art: but with regard to <HI>execution,</HI> he mu&s;t &s;et up on his own &s;tock. A <HI>manneri&s;t,</HI> I fear, he mu&s;t be. If he get a manner of his own, he <HI>may</HI> be an agreeable manneri&s;t: but if he copy another's, he <HI>will certainly</HI> be a formal one. The more clo&s;ely he copies nature, the better chance he has of being free from this general defect.</P>
<P>At <HI>Lidbroke</HI> is a large wharf, where coals are &s;hipped for Hereford, and other places. Here the &s;cene is new, and plea&s;ing. All has thus far been grandeur, and tranquillity. It is now life, and bu&s;tle. A road runs dia|gonally along the bank; and hor&s;es, and carts
<PB N="36" REF="55">appear pa&s;&s;ing to the &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, which lie again&s;t the wharf, to receive their burdens. Clo&s;e behind, a rich, woody hill hangs &s;loping over the wharf, and forms a grand back|ground to the whole. The contra&s;t of all this bu&s;ine&s;s, the engines u&s;ed in lading, and unlading, together with the &s;olemnity of the &s;cene, produce all together a picture&s;que a&s;|&s;emblage. The &s;loping hill is the front-&s;creen; the two &s;ide-&s;creens are low.</P>
<P>The front &s;oon becomes a lofty &s;ide-&s;creen on the left; and &s;weeping round the eye at <HI>Wel&s;h-Bicknor,</HI> forms a noble amphitheatre.</P>
<P>At <HI>Cold-well,</HI> the front-&s;creen fir&s;t appears as a woody hill, &s;welling to a point. In a few minutes, it changes it's &s;hape, and the woody hill becomes a lofty &s;ide-&s;creen, on the right; while the front unfolds it&s;elf into a maje&s;tic piece of rock-&s;cenery.</P>
<P>Here we &s;hould have gone on &s;hore, and walked to the <HI>New-Weir,</HI> which by land is
<PB N="37" REF="56">only a mile; though by water, I believe, it is three times as far. This walk would have afforded us, we were informed, &s;ome very noble river-views: Nor &s;hould we have lo&s;t any thing by relinqui&s;hing the water; which in this part was unintere&s;ting.</P>
<P>The whole of this information we &s;hould probably have found true; if the weather had permitted us to have profitted by it. The latter part of it was certainly well-founded: for the water-views, in this part, were very tame. We left the rocks, and precipices behind; exchanging them for low-banks, and &s;edges.</P>
<P>But the grand &s;cenery &s;oon returned. We approached it however gradually. The views at <HI>White-church</HI> were an introduction to it. Here we &s;ailed through a long reach of hills; who&s;e &s;loping &s;ides were covered with large, lumpi&s;h, detached &s;tcones; which &s;eemed, in a cour&s;e of years, to have rolled from a girdle of rocks, that &s;urrounds the upper regions of the&s;e high grounds on both &s;ides of the river; but particularly on the left.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="57">From the&s;e rocks we &s;oon approached the <HI>New-Weir;</HI> which may be called the &s;econd grand &s;cene on the Wye.</P>
<P>The river is wider, than u&s;ual, in this part; and takes a &s;weep round a towering pro|montory of rock; which forms the &s;ide-&s;creen on the left; and is the grand feature of the view. It is not a broad, fractured face of rock; but rather a woody hill, from which large projections, in two or three places, bur&s;t out; rudely hung with twi&s;ting branches, and &s;haggy furniture; which, like mane round the lion's head, give a more &s;avage air to the&s;e wild exhibitions of nature. Near the top a pointed fragment of &s;olitary rock, ri&s;ing above the re&s;t, has rather a fanta&s;tic ap|pearance: but it is not without it's effect in marking the &s;cene.</P>
<P>A great matter in land&s;cape has adorned an imaginary view with a circum&s;tance exactly &s;imilar:
<Q><L>Stabat acuta &s;ilex, praeci&s;is undi&abque; &s;axis,</L>
<L>&mdash; dor&s;o in&s;urgens, alti&s;&s;ima vi&s;u,</L>

<P><PB REF="58"><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="59">On the right &s;ide of the river, the bank forms a woody amphitheatre, following the cour&s;e of the &s;tream round the promontory. It's lower &s;kirts are adorned with a hamlet; in the mid&s;t of which, volumes of thick &s;moke, thrown up at intervals, from an iron-forge, as it's fires receive fre&s;h fuel, add double grandeur to the &s;cene.</P>
<P>But what peculiarly marks this view, is a circum&s;tance on the water. The whole river, at this place, makes a precipitate fall; of no great height indeed; but enough to merit the title of a ca&s;cade: tho to the eye above the &s;tream, it is an object of no con&s;equence. In all the &s;cenes we had yet pa&s;&s;ed, the water moving with a &s;low, and &s;olemn pace, the objects around kept time, as it were, with it; and every &s;teep, and every rock, which hung over the river, was &s;olemn, tranquil, and ma|je&s;tic. But here, the violence of the &s;tream, and the roaring of the waters, impre&s;&s;ed a new character on the &s;cene: all was agitation, and uproar; and every &s;teep, and every rock &s;tared with wildne&s;s, and terror.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="60">A fi&s;hing-boat is u&s;ed in this part of the river, which is curious. It is con&s;tructed of waxed canvas, &s;tretched over a few &s;light ribs; and holds only a &s;ingle man. It is called a <HI>coricle;</HI> and is derived probably, as it's name imports, from the ancient boat, which was formed of <HI>leather.</HI></P>
<P>An adventrous fellow, for a wager, once navigated a <HI>coricle</HI> as far as the i&s;le of Lundy, at the mouth of the Bri&s;tol-channel. A full fortnight, or more, he &s;pent in this dangerous voyage; and it was happy for him, that it was a fortnight of &s;erene weather. Many a current, and many an eddy; many a flowing tide, and many an ebbing one, afforded him occa&s;ion to exert all his &s;kill, and dexterity. Sometimes his little bark was carried far to leeward; and &s;ometimes as far to windward: but &s;till he recovered his cour&s;e; per&s;evered in his under|taking; and at length happily atchieved it. When he returned to the <HI>New-Weir,</HI> report &s;ays, the account of his expedition was received like a voyage round the world.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="61">Below the <HI>New-Weir</HI> are other rocky views of the &s;ame kind, though le&s;s beautiful. But de&s;cription flags in running over &s;uch a monotony of terms. <HI>High, low, &s;teep, woody, rocky,</HI> and a few others, are all the colours of language we have, to de&s;cribe &s;cenes; in which there are infinite gradations; and, amid&s;t &s;ome general &s;amene&s;s, infinite pe|culiarities.</P>
<P>After we had pa&s;&s;ed a few of the&s;e &s;cenes, the hills gradually de&s;cend into Monmouth; which lies too low to make any appearance from the water: but on landing, we found it a plea&s;ant town, and neatly built. The town|hou&s;e, and church, are both hand&s;ome.</P>
<P>The tran&s;mutations of time are often ludicrous. Monmouth-ca&s;tle was formerly the palace of a king; and birth-place of a mighty prince: it is now converted into a yard for fatting ducks.</P>
<P>The &s;un had &s;et before we arrived at Mon|mouth. Here we met our chai&s;e: but, on
<PB N="42" REF="62">enquiry, finding a voyage more likely to produce amu&s;ement, than a journey, we made a new agreement with our bargemen; and embarked again, the next morning.</P>

<P>AS we left Monmouth, the banks, on the left, were, at fir&s;t, low; but on both &s;ides they &s;oon grew &s;teep, and woody; varying their &s;hapes, as they had done the day before. The mo&s;t beautiful of the&s;e &s;cenes is in the neighbourhood of St. Breval's ca&s;tle; where the va&s;t, woody declivities, on each hand, are uncommonly magnificent. The ca&s;tle is at too great a di&s;tance to make any object in the view.</P>
<P>The weather was now &s;erene: the &s;un &s;hone; and we &s;aw enough of the effect of light, in the exhibitions of this day, to regret the want of it the day before.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="65">During the whole cour&s;e of our voyage from Ro&s;s, we had &s;carce &s;een one corn-field. The banks of the Wye con&s;i&s;t, almo&s;t entirely either of wood, or of pa&s;turage; which I mention as a circum&s;tance of peculiar value in land&s;cape. Furrowed-lands, and waving-corn, however charming in pa&s;toral poetry, are ill-accommo|dated to painting. The painter never de&s;ires the hand of art to touch his grounds.&mdash;But if art <HI>mu&s;t</HI> &s;tray among them&mdash;if it <HI>mu&s;t</HI> mark out the limits of property, and turn them to the u&s;es of agriculture; he wi&s;hes, that the&s;e limits may, as much as po&s;&s;ible, be concealed; and that the lands they circum&s;cribe, may approach, as nearly as may be, to nature&mdash;that is, that they may be pa&s;turage. Pa&s;turage not only pre&s;ents an agreeable &s;urface: but the cattle, which graze it, add great variety, and animation to the &s;cene.</P>
<P>The meadows, below Monmouth, which ran &s;helving from the hills to the water-&s;ide, were particularly beautiful, and well-inhabited. Flocks of &s;heep were every where hanging on their green &s;teeps; and herds of cattle occu|pying the lower grounds. We often failed pa&s;t groups of them laving their &s;ides in the
<PB REF="66"><FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="45" REF="67">water: or retiring from the heat under &s;heltered banks.</P>
<P>In this part of the river al&s;o, which now begins to widen, we were often entertained with light ve&s;&s;els gliding pa&s;t us. Their white &s;ails pa&s;&s;ing along the &s;ides of woodland hills were very picture&s;que.</P>
<P>In many places al&s;o the views were varied by the pro&s;pect of bays, and harbours in mi|niature; where little barks lay moored, taking in ore, and other commodities from the moun|tains. The&s;e ve&s;&s;els, de&s;igned plainly for rougher water, than they at pre&s;ent incountred, &s;hewed us, without any geographical know|ledge, that we approached the &s;ea.</P>
<P>From Monmouth we reached, by a late breakfa&s;t-hour, the noble ruin of <HI>Tintern|abbey;</HI> which belongs to the Duke of Beaufort; and is e&s;teemed, with its appendages, the mo&s;t beautiful and picture&s;que view on the river.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="68">Ca&s;tles, and abbeys have different &s;ituations, agreeable to their re&s;pective u&s;es. The ca&s;tle, meant for defence, &s;tands boldly on the hill; the abbey, intended for meditation, is hid in the &s;eque&s;tered vale.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Ah! happy thou,</HI> if one &s;uperior rock</L>
<L>Bear on it's brow, the &s;hivered fragment huge</L>
<L>Of &s;ome old Norman fortre&s;s: happier far,</L>
<L>Ah then mo&s;t happy, if thy vale below</L>
<L>Wa&s;h, with the cry&s;tal coolne&s;s of it's rills,</L>
<L>Some mould'ring abbey's ivy-ve&s;ted wall.</L></Q>
<P>Such is the &s;ituation of <HI>Tintern-abbey.</HI> It occupies a gentle eminence in the middle of a circular valley, beautifully &s;creened on all &s;ides by woody hills; through which the river winds it's cour&s;e; and the hills, clo&s;ing on it's en|trance, and on it's exit, leave no room for inclement bla&s;ts to enter. A more plea&s;ing retreat could not ea&s;ily be found. The woods, and glades intermixed; the winding of the river; the variety of the ground; the &s;plendid ruin, contra&s;ted with the objects of nature; and the elegant line formed by the &s;ummits of the hills, which include the whole; make all together a very inchanting piece of &s;cenery.

<PB N="47" REF="71">Every thing around breathes an air &s;o calm, and tranquil; &s;o &s;eque&s;tered from the commerce of life; that it is ea&s;y to conceive, a man of warm imagination, in monki&s;h times, might have been allured by &s;uch a &s;cene to become an inhabitant of it.</P>
<P>No part of the ruins of Tintern is &s;een from the river, except the abbey-church. It has been an elegant Gothic pile; but it does not make that appearance as a <HI>di&s;tant</HI> object, which we expected. Tho the parts are beautiful, the whole is ill-&s;haped. No ruins of the tower are left, which might give form, and contra&s;t to the buttre&s;&s;es, and walls. In&s;tead of this, a number of gabel-ends hurt the eye with their regularity; and di&s;gu&s;t it by the vulgarity of their &s;hape. A mallet judiciou&s;ly u&s;ed (but who dur&s;t u&s;e it?) might be of &s;ervice in fracturing &s;ome of them; particularly tho&s;e of the cro&s;s i&s;les, which are not only di&s;agreeable in them&s;elves, but confound the per&s;pective.</P>
<P>But were the building ever &s;o beautiful, incompa&s;&s;ed as it is with &s;habby hou&s;es, it could make no appearance from the river. From a &s;tand near the road, it is &s;een to more advantage.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="72">But if <HI>Tintern-abbey</HI> be le&s;s &s;triking as a <HI>di&s;tant</HI> object, it exhibits, on a <HI>nearer</HI> view, (when the whole together cannot be &s;een, but the eye &s;ettles on &s;ome of it's nobler parts,) a very inchanting piece of ruin. Nature has now made it her own. Time has worn off all traces of the rule: it has blunted the &s;harp edges of the chi&s;&s;el; and broken the regularity of oppo&s;ing parts. The figured ornaments of the ea&s;t-window are gone; tho&s;e of the we&s;t-window are left. Mo&s;t of the other windows, with their principal ornaments, remain.</P>
<P>To the&s;e were &s;uperadded the ornaments of time. Ivy, in ma&s;&s;es uncommonly large, had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of many parts of the wall; and given a happy contra&s;t to the grey-coloured &s;tone, of which the building is compo&s;ed. Nor was this undecorated. Mo&s;&s;es of various hues, with lychens, maiden-hair, penny-leaf, and other humble plants, had over-&s;pread the &s;urface; or hung from every joint, and crevice. Some of them were in flower, others only in leaf; but all together gave tho&s;e full-blown tints, which add the riche&s;t fini&s;hing to a ruin.</P>
<P>Such is the beautiful appearance, which Tintern-abbey exhibits on the <HI>out&s;ide</HI> in tho&s;se
<PB N="49" REF="73">parts, where we can obtain a near view of it. But when we <HI>enter it,</HI> we &s;ee it in mo&s;t perfec|tion: at lea&s;t, if we con&s;ider it as an independent object, unconnected with land&s;cape. The roof is gone: but the walls, and pillars, and abutments, which &s;upported it, are entire. A few of the pillars indeed have given way; and here and there, a piece of the facing of he wall: but in corre&s;pondent parts, one always remains to tell the &s;tory. The pave|ment is obliterated: the elevation of the choir is no longer vi&s;ible: the whole area is reduced to one level; cleared of rubbi&s;h; and covered with neat turf, clo&s;ely &s;horn; and interrupted with nothing, but the noble columns, which formed the i&s;les, and &s;upported the tower.</P>
<P>When we &s;tood at one end of this awful piece of ruin; and &s;urveyed the whole in one view&mdash;the elements of air, and earth, it's only covering, and pavement; and the grand, and venerable remains, which terminated both&mdash;perfect enough to form the per&s;pective; yet broken enough to de&s;troy the regularity; the eye was above mea&s;ure delighted with the beauty, the greatne&s;s, and the novelty of the &s;cene. More <HI>picture&s;que</HI> it certainly would have been, if the area, unadorned, had been
<PB N="50" REF="74">left with all it's rough fragments of ruin &s;cat|tered round; and bold was the hand that removed them: yet as the out&s;ide of the ruin, which is the chief object of <HI>picture&s;que curio&s;ity,</HI> is &s;till left in all it's wild, and native rudene&s;s; we excu&s;e&mdash;perhaps we approve&mdash;the neatne&s;s, that is introduced within. It <HI>may</HI> add to the <HI>beauty</HI> of the &s;cene&mdash;to it's <HI>novelty</HI> it undoubt|edly <HI>does.</HI></P>
<P>Among other things in this &s;cene of de|&s;olation, the poverty and wretchedne&s;s of the inhabitants were remarkable. They occupy little huts, rai&s;ed among the ruins of the mona&s;tery; and &s;eem to have no employment, but begging: as if a place, once devoted to indolence, could never again become the &s;eat of indu&s;try. As we left the abbey, we found the whole hamlet at the gate, either openly &s;oliciting alms; or covertly, under the pre|tence of carrying us to &s;ome part of the ruins, which each could &s;hew; and which was far &s;uperior to any thing, which could be &s;hewn by any one el&s;e. The mo&s;t lucrative occa&s;ion could not have excited more jealou&s;y, and contention.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="75">One poor woman we followed, who had engaged to &s;hew us the monk's library. She could &s;carce crawl; &s;huffling along her pal&s;ied limbs, and meager, contracted body, by the help of two &s;ticks. She led us, through an old gate, into a place over&s;pread with nettles, and briars; and pointing to the remnant of a &s;hattered cloi&s;ter, told us, that was the place. It was her own man&s;ion. All indeed &s;he meant to tell us, was the &s;tory of her own wretchedne&s;s; and all &s;he had to &s;hew us, was her own mi&s;erable habitation. We did not expect to be intere&s;ted: but we found we were. I never &s;aw &s;o loath&s;ome a human dwelling. It was a cavity, loftily vaulted, between two ruined walls; which &s;treamed with various-coloured &s;tains of unwhole&s;ome dews. The floor was earth; yielding, through moi&s;ture, to the tread. Not the mere&s;t uten|&s;il, or furniture of any kind appeared, but a wretched bed&s;tead, &s;pread with a few rags, and drawn into the middle of the cell, to prevent it's receiving the damp, which trickled down the walls. At one end was an aperture; which &s;erved ju&s;t to let in light enough to di&s;cover the wretchedne&s;s within.&mdash;When we &s;tood in the mid&s;t of this cell of mi&s;ery;
<PB N="52" REF="76">and felt the chilling damps, which &s;truck us in every direction, we were rather &s;urpri&s;ed, that the wretched inhabitant was &s;till alive; than that &s;he had only lo&s;t the u&s;e of her limbs.</P>
<P>The country about <HI>Tintern-abbey</HI> hath been de&s;cribed as a &s;olitary, tranquil &s;cene: but it's immediate environs only are meant. With|in half a mile of it are carried on great iron|works; which introduce noi&s;e and bu&s;tle into the&s;e regions of tranquillity.</P>
<P>The ground, about the&s;e works, appears from the river to con&s;i&s;t of grand woody hills, &s;weeping, and inter&s;ecting each other, in ele|gant lines. They are a continuation of the &s;ame kind of land&s;cape, as that about <HI>Tintern-abbey;</HI> and are fully equal to it.</P>
<P>As we &s;till de&s;cend the river, the &s;ame &s;cenery continues. The banks are equally &s;teep, winding, and woody; and in &s;ome parts diver&s;ified by prominent rocks, and ground finely broken, and adorned.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="77">But one great di&s;advantage began here to invade us. Hitherto the river had been clear, and &s;plendid; reflecting the &s;everal objects on it's banks. But it's waters now became ouzy, and di&s;coloured. Sludgy &s;hores too appeared, on each &s;ide; and other &s;ymptoms, which di&s;covered the influence of a tide.</P>

<P>MR. Morris's improvements at Persfield, which we &s;oon approached, are gene|rally thought as much worth a traveller's no|tice, as any thing on the banks of the Wye.

<P>The eminence, on which we &s;tood, (one of tho&s;e grand eminences, which overlooks the Wye,) is an intermixture of rock, and wood; and forms, in this place, a concave &s;emicircle; &s;weeping round in a &s;egment of two miles. The river winds under it; and the &s;cenery, of cour&s;e, is &s;hewn in various

<P>Little indeed was left for improvement, but to open walks, and views, through the woods, to the various objects around them. All this the ingenious proprietor hath done with great judgment; and hath &s;hewn his rocks, his woods, and his precipices, under various forms; and to great advantage. Some|times a broad face of rock is pre&s;ented, &s;tretch|ing along a va&s;t &s;pace, like the walls of a citadel. Sometimes it is broken by interven|ing trees. In other parts, the rocks ri&s;e above the woods; a little farther, they &s;ink below them: &s;ometimes, they are &s;een through them; and &s;ometimes one &s;eries of rocks appears ri&s;ing above another: and tho many of the&s;e objects are repeatedly &s;een, yet &s;een from dif|ferent &s;tations, and with new accompaniments, they appear new. The winding of the pre|cipice is the magical &s;ecret, by which all the&s;e inchanting &s;cenes are produced.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="80">We cannot however call the&s;e views pic|ture&s;que. They are either pre&s;ented from too high a point; or they have little to mark them as characteri&s;tic; or they do not fall into &s;uch compo&s;ition, as would appear to advantage on canvas. But they are extremely romantic; and give a loo&s;e to the mo&s;t plea&s;ing riot of imagination.</P>
<P>The&s;e views are chiefly &s;hewn from different &s;tands in a clo&s;e walk, carried along the brow of the precipice. It would be invidious per|haps to remark a degree of tediou&s;ne&s;s in this walk; and too much &s;amene&s;s in many of the views; notwith&s;tanding the general variety, which inlivens them: but the intention pro|bably is not yet complete; and many things are meant to be hid, which are now too pro|fu&s;ely &s;hewn<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As it is many years, &s;ince the&s;e remarks were made, everal alterations have probably, &s;ince that time, taken place.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Having &s;een every thing on this &s;ide of the hill, the walks we pur&s;ued, led us over the ridge of it to the oppo&s;ite &s;ide. Here the ground, depo&s;iting it's wild appearance, a&s;&s;umes a more civilized form. It con&s;i&s;ts of a great
<PB N="58" REF="81">variety of lawns, intermixed with wood, and rock; and, tho it often ri&s;es, and falls, yet it de&s;cends without any violence into the coun|try beyond it.</P>
<P>The views, on this &s;ide, are not the ro|mantic &s;teeps of the Wye: but tho of another &s;pecies, they are equally grand. They are chiefly di&s;tances, con&s;i&s;ting of the va&s;t waters of the Severn, here an arm of the &s;ea; bounded by a remote country&mdash;of the mouth of the Wye entering the Severn&mdash;and of the town of Chep&s;tow, and it's ca&s;tle, and abbey. Of all the&s;e di&s;tant objects an admirable u&s;e is made; and they are &s;hewn, (as the rocks of the Wye were on the other &s;ide) &s;ometimes in parts; and &s;ometimes all together. In one &s;tation we had the &s;cenery of both &s;ides of the hill at once.</P>
<P>It is a pity, the ingenious embelli&s;her of the&s;e &s;cenes could not have been &s;atisfied with the grand beauties of nature, which he com|manded. The &s;hrubberies he has introduced in this part of his improvements, I fear, will rather be e&s;teemed paltry. As the embelli&s;h|ments of a hou&s;e; or as the ornament of little &s;cenes, which have nothing better to recom|mend them, a few flowering &s;hrubs artfully
<PB N="59" REF="82">compo&s;ed may have their elegance and beauty: but in &s;cenes, like this, they are only &s;plendid patches, which injure the grandeur, and &s;im|plicity of the whole.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash; Forta&s;&s;e cupre&s;&s;um</L>
<L>Scis &s;imulare: quid hoc?&mdash;</L>
<L>&mdash;Sit quidvis &s;implex duntaxat et unum.</L></Q>
<P>It is not the &s;hrub, which offends: it is the <HI>formal introduction</HI> of it. Wild under|wood may be an appendage of the grande&s;t &s;cene. It is a beautiful appendage. A bed of violets, or lillies may enamel the ground, with propriety, at the root of an oak: but if you introduce them artificially in a border, you introduce a trifling formality; and di&s;|grace the noble object, you wi&s;h to adorn.</P>
<P>From the &s;cenes of Persfield we walked to Chep&s;tow; our barge drawing too much water to pa&s;s the &s;hallows, till the return of the tide. In this walk we wi&s;hed for more time, than we could command, to examine the romantic &s;cenes which &s;urrounded us: but we were obliged to return, that evening, to Monmouth.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="83">The road, at fir&s;t, affords beautiful di&s;tant views of tho&s;e woody hills, which had en|tertained us on the banks of the Wye; and which appeared to as much advantage, when connected with the country, as they had already done in union with the river. But the coun|try &s;oon lo&s;es it's picture&s;que form; and a&s;&s;umes a bleak unplea&s;ant wildne&s;s.</P>
<P>About &s;even miles from Chep&s;tow, we had an exten&s;ive view into Wales, bounded by mountains very remote. But this view, tho much celebrated, has little, except the gran|deur of exten&s;ion, to recommend it. And yet, it is po&s;&s;ible, that in &s;ome lights it may be very picture&s;que; and that we might only have had the misfortune to &s;ee it in an un|favourable one. Different lights make &s;o great a change even in the <HI>compo&s;ition</HI> of land&s;cape&mdash;at lea&s;t in the <HI>apparent</HI> compo&s;ition of it, that they create a &s;cene perfectly new. In di&s;tance e&s;pecially this is the cafe. Hills and vallies may be deranged; awkward abrupt|ne&s;&s;es, and hollows introduced; and the effect
<PB N="61" REF="84">of woods, and ca&s;tles, and all the ornamental detail of a country, lo&s;t. On the other hand, the&s;e ingredients of land&s;cape may in <HI>reality</HI> be awkwardly introduced; yet through the magical <HI>influence of light,</HI> they may be altered, &s;oftened, and rendered plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>In a mountainous country particularly, I have often &s;een, during the morning hours, a range of hills, rearing their &s;ummits, in ill-di&s;po&s;ed, fanta&s;tic &s;hapes. In the af|ternoon, all this incorrect rudene&s;s hath been removed; and each mi&s;hapen &s;ummit hath &s;oftened beautifully into &s;ome plea&s;ing form.</P>
<P>The different &s;ea&s;ons of the year al&s;o pro|duce the &s;ame effect. When the &s;un rides high in &s;ummer; and when, in the &s;ame meridian, he ju&s;t &s;kirts the horizon in win|ter, he forms the mountain-tops, and indeed the whole face of a country, into very dif|ferent appearances.</P>
<P>Fogs al&s;o vary a di&s;tant country as much as light, &s;oftening the har&s;h features of land|&s;cape; and &s;preading over them a beautiful, grey, harmonizing tint.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="85">We remark further, on this &s;ubject, that &s;carce any land&s;cape will &s;tand the te&s;t of <HI>different lights.</HI> Some &s;earching ray, as the &s;un veers round, will expo&s;e it's defects. And hence it is, that almo&s;t <HI>every</HI> land&s;cape is &s;een be&s;t under <HI>&s;ome peculiar</HI> illlumination&mdash;either of an evening, or of a morning, or, it may be, of a meridian, &s;un.</P>
<P>During many miles we kept upon the heights; and, through a long, and gentle de&s;cent, approached Monmouth. Before we reached it we were benighted: but as far as we could judge of a country through the grey ob&s;curity of a &s;ummer-evening, this &s;eemed to abound with many beautiful, woody val|lies among the hills, which we de&s;cended. A light of this kind, tho not &s;o favourable to land&s;cape, is very favourable to the ima|gination. This active power embodies half-&s;ormed images; and gives exi&s;tence to the mo&s;t illu&s;ive &s;cenes. The&s;e it rapidly com|bines; and often compo&s;es land&s;capes, perhaps more beautiful, than any, that exi&s;t in na|ture. They are formed indeed from nature&mdash;from the mo&s;t beautiful of her &s;cenes;
<PB N="63" REF="86">and having been trea&s;ured up in the memory, are called into the&s;e imaginary creations by &s;ome di&s;tant re&s;emblances, which &s;trike the eye in the multiplicity of dubious &s;urfaces, that float before it.</P>

<P>HAVING thus navigated the Wye be|tween Ro&s;s, and Chep&s;tow, we had &s;uch plea&s;ing accounts of it's beautiful &s;cenery above Ro&s;s, that if our time had permitted, we could have wi&s;hed to have explored it.</P>
<P>A journal however fell into my hands, (&s;ince the fir&s;t edition of this book was print|ed) of a tour to the &s;ource of the Wye; and from thence through the midland counties of Wales; which I &s;hall put into a little form; and making a few remarks on different parts of it, &s;hall in&s;ert here for the benefit of tho&s;e, who may have more time than we had.</P>
<P>From Ro&s;s to Hereford the great road leaves the river, which is hardly once &s;een. But it is not probable, that much is lo&s;t; for the whole country here has a tame appearance.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="88">The cathedral of Hereford con&s;i&s;ts, in many parts, of rich Gothic. The we&s;t-front is falling fa&s;t to decay, and is every year re|ceiving more the form of a fine ruin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A &s;ub&s;cription I hear, is now opened to repair it.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>At Hereford we again meet the Wye; of which we have &s;everal beautiful views from the higher grounds. The road now follows the cour&s;e of the river to the Hay; winding along it's northern banks.</P>
<P>About &s;ix miles from Hereford, and very little out of the road, &s;tands Foxley. The form of the grounds about it, and the beautiful woods that &s;urround it, are &s;aid to be worth &s;eeing. My journali&s;t &s;ays it contains a choice collection of pictures; and &s;ome good drawings of land&s;cape by the late Mr. Price.</P>
<P>The ruins of Bradwardine-ca&s;tle appear &s;oon in view; tho but little of them remains. At a bridge near them you cro&s;s the Wye, and now traver&s;e the &s;outh-&s;ide of the river. The country, which had been greatly varied before, begins now to form bolder &s;wells. Among the&s;e Mirebich-hill, which ri&s;es full in front, continues &s;ome time before the eye, as a con&s;i|derable object.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="89">Leaving Witney-bridge on the right, you &s;till continue your cour&s;e along the &s;outhern bank of the river; and come &s;oon in view of the ruins of Clyfford-ca&s;tle; where tradition informs us, the celebrated Ro&s;amond &s;pent her early life.</P>
<P>Soon after, you arrive at the Hay; a town plea&s;antly &s;ituated on the Wye. It was for|merly a Roman &s;tation; and was long after|wards con&s;idered as a place of great &s;trength; being defended by a ca&s;tle, and lofty walls, till Owen Glendouer laid it in a&s;hes in one of tho&s;e expeditions, in which he drove Harry Bullin-broke</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;thrice from the banks of Wye,</L>
<L>And &s;andy-bottomed Severn&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>If you have time to make a little excur&s;ion, you will find about half way between the Hay, and Abergavenny, the ruins of Llan|tony-priory. Dugdale de&s;cribes it, in his Mona&s;ticon, as a &s;cene richly adorned with wood. But Dugdale lived a century ago; which is a term that will produce, or de|&s;troy,
<PB N="68" REF="90">the fine&s;t &s;cenery. It has had the lat|ter effect here; for the woods about Llan|tony-priory are now totally de&s;troyed; and the ruin is wholly naked, and de&s;olate.</P>
<P>After this excur&s;ion, you return again to the Hay; and continue your rout to Bualt, &s;till on the &s;outh &s;ide of the river.</P>
<P>On the north &s;ide, about four miles beyond the Hay, &s;tands Mae&s;lough, the ancient &s;eat of the Howarths. The hou&s;e &s;hews the ne|glect of it's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or: but the &s;ituation is in it's kind perhaps one of the fine&s;t in Wales. The view from the hall-door is &s;poken of as wonderfully amu&s;ing. A lawn extends to the river; which incircles it with a curve, at the di&s;tance of half a mile. The banks are in|riched with various objects; among which two bridges, with winding roads, and the tower of Gla&s;bury-church, &s;urrounded by wood, are con&s;picuous. A di&s;tant country equally inriched, fills the remote parts of the land&s;cape, which is terminated by mountains. One of the bridges in this view, that at Gla&s;bury, is remarkably light, and elegant, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal arches.&mdash;How the&s;e various objects are brought
<PB N="69" REF="91">together, I know not. I &s;hould fear there were too many of them.</P>
<P>As you continue your rout to Bualt, the country grows grander, and more picture&s;que. The valley of the Wye becomes contracted, and the road runs at the bottom; along the edge of the water.</P>
<P>It is po&s;&s;ible, I think, the Wye may in this place be more beautiful, than in any other part of it's cour&s;e. Between Ro&s;s, and Chep|&s;tow, the grandeur, and beauty of <HI>it's banks</HI> are it's chief prai&s;e. The <HI>river it&s;elf</HI> has no other merit, than that of a winding &s;urface of &s;mooth water. But here, added to the &s;ame decoration from it's banks, the Wye it&s;elf a&s;&s;umes a more beautiful character; pouring over &s;helving rocks; and forming it&s;elf into eddies, and ca&s;cades, which a &s;olemn pa|rading &s;tream through a flat channel, cannot exhibit.</P>
<P>An additional merit al&s;o accrues to &s;uch a river from the different forms it a&s;&s;umes, ac|cording to the fullne&s;s, or emptine&s;s of the &s;tream. There are rocks of all &s;hapes, and &s;izes; which always vary the appearance of the water, as it ru&s;hes over, or plays among
<PB N="70" REF="92">them: &s;o that &s;uch a river, to a picture&s;que eye, is a continued fund of new entertainment.</P>
<P>The Wye al&s;o, in this part of it's cour&s;e, &s;till receives farther beauty from the woods, which adorn it's banks; and which the na|vigation of the river, in it's lower reaches, cannot allow. Here the whole is perfectly rural, and unincumbered. Even a boat, I believe, is never &s;een beyond the Hay. The boat it&s;elf might be an ornament: but we would not give up for it &s;uch a river, as would not &s;uffer a boat.</P>
<P>Some beauties however the &s;mooth river po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es above the rapid one. In the latter you cannot have tho&s;e reflections, which are &s;o ornamental to the former.&mdash;Nor can you have in the rapid river, the opportunity of contemplating the grandeur of it's banks from the &s;urface of the water&mdash;unle&s;s indeed the road winds clo&s;e with the river at the bot|tom, when perhaps you may &s;ee them with additional advantage.</P>
<P>The foundation of the&s;e critici&s;ms on <HI>&s;mooth</HI> and <HI>agitated</HI> water, is this. When water is exhibited in <HI>&s;mall quantities,</HI> it wants the agitation of a torrent, a ca&s;cade, or &s;ome other adventitious circum&s;tance, to give it con&s;e|quence.
<PB N="71" REF="93">But when it is &s;pread out in the <HI>reach of &s;ome capital river</HI>&mdash;in a <HI>lake</HI>&mdash;or an <HI>arm of the &s;ea</HI>&mdash;it is then able to &s;upport it's own dignity. In the former ca&s;e it aims at beauty: in the latter at grandeur. Now the Wye has in no part of it's cour&s;e, a quantity of water &s;ufficient to give it any great degree of grandeur; &s;o that of con&s;equence the <HI>&s;mooth</HI> part mu&s;t, on the whole, yield to the more <HI>agitated,</HI> which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es more beauty.</P>
<P>In this wild inchanting country &s;tands Llan|goed, the hou&s;e of &s;ir Edward Williams. It is adorned, like the hou&s;e at Foxley, with woods, and playing grounds: but is a &s;cene totally different. Here however are finer trees, than tho&s;e at Foxley; which, when examined as individuals, appear to great advantage: tho my journali&s;t has heard, that &s;ome of the fine&s;t of them have lately been cut down.</P>
<P>The road &s;till continues through the &s;ame beautiful country, along the banks of the Wye; and in a few miles farther brings you to Bualt. This town is &s;eated in a plea&s;ant vale, &s;urrounded with woods.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="94">A little beyond Bualt, where the river Irvon falls into the Wye, is a field, &s;till marked by tradition, in which Llewellin, the la&s;t prince of Wales, was put to death. Some hi&s;torians &s;ay, he was killed in battle; but the tradi|tional account of his being killed near Bualt &s;eems more probable; and that he fell by the hands of an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in. When Edward invaded Wales, we are informed, that Llewellin had intrenched him&s;elf in the fa&s;tne&s;&s;es of Snow|don. Here he might probably have foiled his adver&s;ary: but &s;ome of his troops having been &s;ucce&s;sful again&s;t the earl of Surrey, one of Edward's generals, Llewellin came down from his &s;trong holds, with the hope of improving his advantage, and offered Edward battle. Llewellin was totally routed; and tra|dition &s;ays that in his flight into Glamorgan|&s;hire, he &s;lept the night before he was mur|dered, at Llechryd, which is now a farm|hou&s;e. Here the farrier, who &s;hod his hor&s;e, knew him under his di&s;gui&s;e; and betrayed him to the people of Bualt, who put him to death; and are to this day &s;tigmatized with
<PB N="73" REF="95">the name of <HI>Brad wyr y Bualht,</HI> or the <HI>trai|tors of Bualt.</HI></P>
<P>At Bualt you cro&s;s the Wye again, and now pur&s;ue your rout along the north &s;ide of the river. The &s;ame grand &s;cenery con|tinues&mdash;lofty banks&mdash;woody vales&mdash;a rocky channel, and a rapid &s;tream winding through it.</P>
<P>Soon after you come to the &s;ulphureous &s;prings of Llanydrindod, which you leave on the right; and cro&s;&s;ing the river Ithon, you reach Rhaader; a town about thirteen miles beyond Bualt.&mdash;To a Wel&s;hman the appear|ance of the Wye at <HI>Rhaader,</HI> need not to be de&s;cribed. The word &s;ignifies a <HI>waterfall.</HI> There is no ca&s;cade indeed of con&s;equence near the place; but the river being pent up within clo&s;e rocky banks, and the channel being &s;teep, the whole is a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of water-falls.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="96">As you leave Rhaader, you begin to ap|proach the &s;ources of the Wye. But the river having now lo&s;t it's chief &s;upplies, becomes more and more in&s;ignificant; and as the country becomes wilder, and more mountain|ous; the &s;cenery of the river is now <HI>di&s;pro|portioned.</HI> There is not a &s;ufficiency of water in the land&s;cape to balance the land.</P>
<P>Llangerig, which is about twelve miles from Rhaader, is the la&s;t village you find on the banks of the Wye. Soon after all &s;igns of inhabitancy cea&s;e. You begin to a&s;cend the &s;kirts of Plinlimmon; and after ri&s;ing gradually about ten miles from Llangerig, you arrive at the &s;ources of a river, which through a cour&s;e of &s;o many leagues hath afforded you &s;o much entertainment.</P>
<P>It is a &s;ingular circum&s;tance, that within a quarter of a mile of the well-head of the Wye, ari&s;es the Severn. The two &s;prings are nearly alike: but the fortunes of rivers, like tho&s;e of men, are owing to various little cir|cum&s;tances, of which they take the advantage
<PB N="75" REF="97">in the early part of their cour&s;e. The Severn meeting with a track of ground, ri&s;ing on the right, &s;oon after it leaves Plinlimmon, receives a pu&s;h towards the north-ea&s;t. In this direc|tion it continues it's cour&s;e to Shrew&s;bury. There it meets another ob&s;truction, which turns it as far to the &s;outh-ea&s;t. Afterwards &s;till meeting with favourable opportunities, it &s;ucce&s;sfully improves them; inlarging it's cir|cle; &s;weeping from one country to another; receiving large acce&s;&s;ions every where of wealth and grandeur; till at length with a full tide, it enters the ocean as an arm of the &s;ea.&mdash;In the mean time the Wye, meeting with no particular opportunities of any con&s;equence to improve it's fortunes, never makes any figure as a capital river; and at length becomes &s;ub&s;ervient to that very Severn, who&s;e birth, and early &s;etting out in life, were exactly &s;imilar to it's own.&mdash;Between the&s;e two rivers is comprehended a di&s;trict, con&s;i&s;ting of great part of the counties of Montgomery, Radnor, Salop, Worce&s;ter, Hereford, and Gloce&s;ter. Of the la&s;t county merely that beautiful portion is inclo&s;ed, which forms the fore&s;t of Dean.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="98">The country about Plinlimmon, va&s;t, wild, and unfurni&s;hed, is neither adorned with ac|companiments, to be a &s;cene of beauty: nor &s;hould I &s;uppo&s;e from the accounts I have received, that it's dreary wa&s;tes could afford &s;uch materials, as could form a &s;cene of grandeur.&mdash;Tho grandeur con&s;i&s;t in &s;impli|city, it mu&s;t take <HI>&s;ome form of land&s;cape;</HI> otherwi&s;e it is a &s;hapele&s;s wa&s;te&mdash;mon&s;trous without proportions.&mdash;As there is nothing therefore in the&s;e inho&s;pitable regions to de|tain you long; and no refre&s;hment to be had, except a draught of pure water from the fountains of the Wye, you will &s;oon be in|clined to return to Rhaader.</P>
<P>From Rhaader my journal leads into Cardi|gan&s;hire. Cro&s;&s;ing the Wye you a&s;cend a very &s;teep mountain, about &s;even miles over. Then &s;kirting the banks of a &s;weet little river, the Elan, which falls into the Wye, you pa&s;s through a corner of Montgomery&s;hire; which brings you to the verge of Cardigan&s;hire.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;age into this county is rather tre|mendous. You &s;tand on very high ground; and &s;ee extending far below, a long, narrow,
<PB N="77" REF="99">contracted valley. The per&s;pective, from the top gives it rather the appearance of a cha&s;m. Down one of the precipitous &s;ides of this valley, I under&s;tand, the road hurries you; while the river I&s;twith at the bottom is ready to receive you, if your foot &s;hould &s;lip, or your hor&s;e &s;tumble.</P>
<P>Having de&s;cended &s;afely to the bottom of the valley; and having now pa&s;&s;ed through it, you cro&s;s the river, at it's clo&s;e, over a hand&s;ome bridge; and arrive at the village of Pentre. Near this place is Havod, the &s;eat of Mr. Johnes, member for Radnor&s;hire; which affords &s;o much beautiful &s;cenery, that you &s;hould by no means pa&s;s by it. It will open &s;ud|denly upon you, at the clo&s;e of a beautiful approach. The hou&s;e is new; built in a &s;tile I learn, between Gothic, and Moori&s;h. It is a &s;tyle of building I am not acquainted with; but I am informed it has a good effect. It is a large commodious man&s;ion, richly furni&s;hed. One thing is worth ob&s;erv|ing. Over the chimney of the dining-room is placed, or to be placed, (for I believe the hou&s;e is not fini&s;hed,) a neat tablet of white marble with this in&s;cription:
<Q><L>&mdash;Prout cui&abque; libido eft,</L>
<L>Siccat inequales cyathos&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="100">The Wel&s;h gentry are very remarkable for their ho&s;pitality; which &s;ometimes, I have heard, will not allow the <HI>inequales cyathos;</HI> but brings all to a <HI>brimming level.</HI> The &s;pirit of this in&s;cription, I hope, is diffu&s;ing it&s;elf more and more over the country.</P>
<P>But elegant hou&s;es, and rich furniture are every where to be found. The &s;cenery at Havod is the object; and &s;uch &s;cenery is rarely met with.&mdash;The walks are divided into what is called the <HI>lady's-walk,</HI> a circuit of about three miles&mdash;and the <HI>gentleman's-walk,</HI> about &s;ix.

<P>The general ground-plot of the&s;e walks, and the &s;cenery through which they convey you, is this.</P>
<P>The river I&s;twith runs at the di&s;tance of about a quarter of a mile from the hou&s;e, which &s;tands upon a lawn, con&s;i&s;ting of varied grounds de&s;cending to the river. It is a rapid &s;tream, and it's channel is filled with rocks, like many other Wel&s;h &s;treams, which form cataracts, and ca&s;cades in various parts&mdash;more broken, and convul&s;ed, than
<PB N="79" REF="101">the Wye about Bualt. It's banks con&s;i&s;t of great variety of wooded rece&s;&s;es&mdash;hills&mdash;&s;ides of mountains&mdash;and contracted vallies&mdash;thwarting, and oppo&s;ing each other in various forms: and adorned with little ca&s;|cades running every where among them, in guttered cha&s;ms. Of the grandeur and beauty of the&s;e &s;cenes I can &s;peak as an eye-witrie&s;s: for tho I was never on the &s;pot, I have &s;een a large collection of drawings, and &s;ketches (not fewer than between twenty and thirty) which were taken from them.</P>
<P>Through this variety of grand &s;cenery the &s;everal walks are conducted. The views &s;hift rapidly from one to another; each being characterized by &s;ome circum&s;tance pecu|liar to it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The artificial ornaments are &s;uch chiefly, as are nece&s;&s;ary. Many bridges are wanted, both in cro&s;&s;ing the I&s;twith; and the &s;everal &s;treams, which run into it from the &s;ur|rounding hills. They are varied as much as that &s;pecies of architecture will admit, from the &s;tone arch to the Alpine plank&mdash;In one place you &s;ee a cottage, plea&s;antly &s;eated among the thickets of a woody hill, which Mr. Johnes intends to fit up for the accom|modation
<PB N="80" REF="102">of a band of mu&s;icians; for &s;o a pack of hounds may be called among the hills, and dales, and ecchoing rocks of the&s;e grand &s;cenes.</P>
<P>Among the natural curio&s;ities of the place, is a noble ca&s;cade &s;ixty feet high, which is &s;een through a cavern, partly natural, and partly artificial. You enter it by a pa&s;&s;age, cut through a rock four feet broad, and &s;even high; which continues about twenty yards; and brings you into a very lofty, perforated cavern, through which you &s;ee the ca&s;cade to great advantage.</P>
<P>From the &s;cenes of Havod, you continue your excur&s;ions, among &s;ome other grand, and beautiful &s;cenery in that country.</P>
<P>You are carried fir&s;t to the <HI>Devil's bridge,</HI> about four miles from Havod. I do not clearly under&s;tand the nature of the &s;cenery here from the account given in my journal; but I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e it is only one grand piece of foreground, without any di&s;tance, or accompaniments; and probably one of tho&s;e &s;cenes, which is it&s;elf &s;ufficient to form a picture. The plan of it is, a rocky cha&s;m; over which is thrown
<PB N="81" REF="103">an arch. Between the&s;e cheeks, and ju&s;t beneath the bridge, the river Funnach falls abruptly down the &s;pace of &s;everal yards; and afterwards meeting with other &s;teeps, makes it's way, after a few of the&s;e interruptions, into the Rhydol, a little below. The bridge, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, is an intere&s;ting object. It con&s;i&s;ts I under&s;tand of two arches, one thrown over the other: the under one, which is that &s;aid to be built by the devil, was not thought &s;ufficient|ly &s;trong. The common people &s;uppo&s;e, when he built it, he had &s;ome mi&s;chief in his head.</P>
<P>From the Devil's bridge, you vi&s;it another, called <HI>Monk's bridge;</HI> where the &s;ame kind of &s;cenery is exhibited under a different modi|fication.</P>
<P>From thence you de&s;cend into the vale of Rhydol, called &s;o from the river of that name, which pa&s;&s;es through it.</P>
<P>If the Wel&s;h counties, di&s;tingui&s;hed for &s;o much beauty of &s;cenery of various kinds, are remarkable for pre-eminence in any mode, I think it is in their <HI>vales.</HI> Their lakes are infi|nitely exceeded, both in grandeur, and beauty, by tho&s;e of Cumberland, We&s;tmoreland, and Scotland. Nor are their mountains, as far as
<PB N="82" REF="104">I have ob&s;erved, of &s;uch picture&s;que form, as many as I have &s;een in tho&s;e countries. They are often of a heavy, lumpi&s;h kind: for there are orders of architecture in mountains, as well as in palaces. Their rivers I allow are often very picture&s;que; and &s;o are their &s;ea-coa&s;t views. But their <HI>vales</HI> and <HI>vallies,</HI> I think, exceed tho&s;e of any country I ever &s;aw.</P>
<P>The vale of Rhydol is de&s;cribed as a very grand, and exten&s;ive &s;cene, continuing not le&s;s than ten miles, among rocks, hanging woods, and varied ground, which in &s;ome parts, becomes mountainous; while the river is every where a beautiful object; and twice, or three times, in it's pa&s;&s;age through the vale, is interrupted in it's cour&s;e, and formed into a ca&s;cade. This is a circum&s;tance in a <HI>vale,</HI> I think, rather uncommon. In a <HI>contracted valley</HI> it is frequent: but an <HI>extended vale,</HI> as I apprehend this to be, is &s;eldom &s;o inter|rupted, as not to give way to the river, on one &s;ide, or the other. I can ea&s;ily however imagine, that when the <HI>whole vale</HI> is inter|rupted, as I conceive it to be here, it will occa&s;ion a very beautiful &s;cene, if the eye from &s;o good a <HI>foreground</HI> hath &s;uch an elevated &s;tation, as will enable it to trace the winding
<PB N="83" REF="105">of the vale, as a di&s;tance, beyond the ca&s;cade. But this is perhaps rea&s;oning (as we often do on higher &s;ubjects,) without &s;ufficient grounds. On the &s;pot, I &s;hould probably find, that all the&s;e conceptions are wrong&mdash;that the ob|&s;trudtions of the river in the vale of Rhydol are no advantage to the &s;cene&mdash;or perhaps, after all, that the <HI>vale of Rhydol</HI> does not de&s;erve that name; but is only a <HI>contracted valley</HI> of con&s;iderable length.</P>
<P>At the end of this <HI>vale</HI> or <HI>valley,</HI> by which|&s;oever of the&s;e names it ought to be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed, &s;tand the ruins of <HI>Abyry&s;thwick-ca&s;tle.</HI> Of this fortre&s;s little now remains, but a &s;olitary tower, over-looking the &s;ea. Once it was the re&s;idence of the great Cad|wallader; and in all the Wel&s;h-wars was con&s;idered as a fortre&s;s of the fir&s;t con&s;equence. Even &s;o late as the civil wars of the la&s;t century it was e&s;teemed a place of great &s;trength.</P>
<P>But the rich lead-mines, in it's neighbour|hood were the ba&s;is of it's glory. The&s;e mines are &s;aid to have yielded near a hundred ounces of &s;ilver from a ton of lead; and to have produced a profit of two thou&s;and pounds a month. Here Sir Hugh Middleton made that va&s;t fortune, which he expended after|wards
<PB N="84" REF="106">on the new river. But a gentleman of the name of Bu&s;hel, rai&s;ed the&s;e mines to their greate&s;t height. He was allowed by Charles the fir&s;t the privilege of &s;etting up a mint in this ca&s;tle, for the benefit of paying his workmen. Here therefore all the bu&s;ine&s;s of the mines was tran&s;acted, which made Abyry&s;thwick-ca&s;tle a place of more con&s;e|quence, and re&s;ort than any other place in Wales. King Charles al&s;o appointed Mr. Bu&s;hel governor of the i&s;le of Lundy; where he made a harbour for the &s;ecurity of his ve&s;&s;els, which carried the produce of his mines up the Severn. When the civil wars broke out, he had an opportunity of &s;hewing his gratitude; which he did with the mag|nificence of a prince. He cloathed the king's whole army; and offered his maje&s;ty a loan, which was con&s;idered as a gift, of forty thou&s;and pounds. Afterwards, when Charles was pre&s;&s;ed by the parliament, Mr. Bu&s;hel rai&s;ed him a regiment, among his miners, at his own expence.</P>
<P>From the vale of Rhydol, you &s;eek again the banks of the <HI>I&s;twitb;</HI> and enter a vale, which takes it name from the river.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="107">This &s;cene is another proof of what I have ju&s;t ob&s;erved of the Wel&s;h vales. From the accounts I have heard of it, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e it a &s;cene of extraordinary beauty&mdash;<HI>le&s;s romantic</HI> than the vale of Rhydol; but <HI>more &s;ylvan.</HI> Nature has introduced the rock more &s;paringly; but &s;he has made great amends by wood: tho there is one part of it mentioned, in which an immen&s;e rock forms a very grand feature.&mdash;It is much ea&s;ier however to <HI>conceive</HI> the variety of the&s;e &s;cenes, than to de&s;cribe them. Nature's alphabet con&s;i&s;ts only of four letters; wood&mdash;water&mdash;rock&mdash;and ground: and yet with the&s;e four letters &s;he forms &s;uch varied compo&s;itions; &s;uch infinite combinations, as no language with an alphabet of twenty-four can de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>From the vale of I&s;twith, you may vi&s;it the ruins of the abbey of <HI>Strata Florida.</HI> But as far as I find there is little among tho&s;e ruins worth notice, except a Saxon gate|way; and that I &s;hould think, can hardly be an object of much beauty.</P>
<P>The painter therefore, who can make little u&s;e of this old abbey, con&s;igns it over to the antiquarian; who tells you, that it was formerly the &s;acred repo&s;itory of the
<PB N="86" REF="108">bones of &s;everal of the Wel&s;h princes; and that here the records, and acts of the prin|cipality were pre&s;erved for many generations.</P>
<P>From the ruins of Strata Florida you return to Hereford, through Rhosfair, Rhaader, Pinabout, and new Radnor; in which rout I find nothing in my journal mentioned, as worth notice; tho it is hardly po&s;&s;ible, that in &s;o large a tract of rough country, there &s;hould not be many picture&s;que pa&s;&s;ages.</P>

<P>FROM Monmouth to Abergavenny, by Ragland-ca&s;tle, the road is a good &s;tone cau&s;eway, (as the roads, in the&s;e parts, com|monly are,) and leads through a plea&s;ant, inclo&s;ed country; di&s;covering, on each &s;ide, exten&s;ive views of rich cultivation.</P>
<P><HI>Ragland-ca&s;tle</HI> &s;eemed to &s;tand, (as we &s;aw it from the heights) in a vale: but as we de&s;cended, it took an elevated &s;tation. It is a large, and very noble ruin: more perfect than ruins of this kind commonly are. It contains two areas within the ditch; into each of which you enter by a lofty, and deep gateway.</P>
<P>The buildings, which circum&s;cribe the fir&s;t area, con&s;i&s;it of the kitchen, and offices.
<PB N="88" REF="111">It is amu&s;ing to hear &s;tories of ancient ho&s;|pitality. <Q>Here are the remains of an oven, &s;aid our conductor, which was large enough to bake a whole ox; and of a fire-range, wide enough to roa&s;t him.</Q></P>
<P>The grand hall, or banquetting-room, a large and lofty apartment, forms the &s;creen between the two areas; and is perfect, except the roof. The mu&s;ic-gallery may be di&s;|tinctly traced; and the butteries, which divide the hall from a parlour. Near the hall is &s;hewn a narrow chapel.</P>
<P>On viewing the comparative &s;ize of halls and chapels in old ca&s;tles, one can hardly, at fir&s;t, avoid ob&s;erving, that the founders of the&s;e ancient &s;tructures &s;uppo&s;ed, a much greater number of people would meet toge|ther to fea&s;t, than to pray. But yet we may perhaps account for the thing, without calling in que&s;tion the piety of our ance&s;tors. The hall was meant to regale a whole country; while the chapel was intended only for the private u&s;e of the inhabitants of the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>The whole area of the fir&s;t inclo&s;ure, is vaulted, and contains cellars, dungeons, and other &s;ubterraneous apartments.&mdash;The build|ings
<PB REF="112"><FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="89" REF="113">of the &s;econd area are confined merely to chambers.</P>
<P>Near the ca&s;tle &s;tands the citadel, a large octagonal tower; two or three &s;ides of which are &s;till remaining. This tower is incircled by a &s;eparate moat; and was formerly joined to the ca&s;tle by a draw-bridge.</P>
<P>Ragland-ca&s;tle owes it's pre&s;ent pictu|re&s;que form to Cromwell; who laid his iron hands upon it; and &s;hattered it into ruin. A window is &s;hewn, through which a girl in the garri&s;on, by waving a handkerchief, introduced his troops.</P>
<P>From Ragland-ca&s;tle the views are &s;till exten&s;ive, the roads inclo&s;ed, and the country rich. The di&s;tances are &s;kirted by the Brecknoc-hills; among which the <HI>Sugar-loaf</HI> makes a remarkable appearance.</P>
<P>The Brecknoc-hills are little more, than gentle &s;wellings, cultivated to the top. For many miles they kept their &s;tation in a di&s;tant range on each &s;ide. But, by degrees, they began to clo&s;e in; approximating more and more; and leaving in front, a narrow pa&s;s between them; through which an
<PB N="90" REF="114">exten&s;ive country appeared. Through this pa&s;s, we hoped, the progre&s;s of our road would lead us; as it &s;eemed to open into a fair, and beautiful country.</P>
<P>It led us fir&s;t to Abergavenny, a &s;mall town, which has formerly been fortified, lying under the hills. We approached it by the ca&s;tle; of which nothing remains, but a few &s;taring ruins.</P>
<P>From hence we were carried, as we ex|pected, through the pa&s;s, which we had long ob&s;erved at a di&s;tance. It opened into the vale of U&s;k.</P>
<P>The vale of U&s;k, is a delightful &s;cene. The river, from whence it borrows it's name, winds through the middle of it; and the hills, on both &s;ides, are diver&s;ified with woods, and lawns. In many places, they are partially cultivated. We could di&s;tingui&s;h little cottages, and farms, faintly traced along their &s;hadowy &s;ides; which, at &s;uch a di&s;tance, rather varied, and inriched the &s;cene; than impre&s;&s;ed it with any regular, and unplea&s;ing &s;hapes.</P>
<P><PB REF="115"><FIGURE>

<PB REF="116"><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="117">Through this kind of road we pa&s;&s;ed many miles. The U&s;k continued, every where, our amu&s;ing companion: and if, at any time, it made a more devious curve, than u&s;ual, we were &s;ure to meet it again, at the next turn. Our pa&s;&s;age through the vale was &s;till more inlivened by many little foaming rills, which cro&s;&s;ed the road (&s;ome of them &s;o large, as to make bridges nece&s;&s;ary,) and two ruined ca&s;tles; with which, at proper intervals, the country is adorned.</P>
<P>After leaving the latter of them, called Tretower-ca&s;tle, we mounted &s;ome high grounds; which gave a variety to the &s;cene, tho not &s;o picture&s;que an exhibition of it. Here the road brought us in view of <HI>Langor's-pool;</HI> which is no very incon&s;i|derable lake. As we de&s;cended the&s;e heights, the U&s;k met us once more at the bottom, and conducted us into Brecknoc.</P>
<P><HI>Brecknoc</HI> is a very romantic place, abound|ing with broken grounds, torrents, di&s;|mantled towers, and ruins of every kind. I have &s;een few places, where a land&s;cape-painter
<PB N="92" REF="118">might get a collection of better ideas. The ca&s;tle has once been large; and is &s;till a ruin of dignity. It is ea&s;y to trace the main body, the citadel, and all the parts of ancient fortification.</P>
<P>In many places indeed the&s;e works are too much ruined, even for picture&s;que u&s;e. Yet, ruined as they are, as far as they go, they are very amu&s;ing. The arts of modern fortification are ill calculated for the pur|po&s;es of land&s;cape. The angular, and formal works of Vauban, and Cohorn, when it comes to their turn to be &s;uper|&s;eded by works of &s;uperior invention, will make a poor figure in the annals of pictu|re&s;que beauty. No eye will ever be delighted with their ruins: while not the lea&s;t frag|ment of a Briti&s;h or a Norman ca&s;tle exi&s;ts, that is not &s;urveyed with delight.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t beautiful &s;cenery we &s;aw at Brecknoc, is about the abbey. We had a view of it, tho but a tran&s;ient view, from a little bridge in the neighbourhood. There we &s;aw a &s;weet limpid &s;tream, gli&s;tening over a bed of pebbles; and forming two or three ca&s;cades, as it hurried to the bridge. It i&s;&s;ued from a wood, with
<PB N="93" REF="119">which it's banks were beautifully hung. Amid&s;t the gloom aro&s;e the ruins of the ab|bey, tinged with a bright ray, which di&s;|covered a profu&s;ion of rich Gothic work|man&s;hip; and exhibited in plea&s;ing contra&s;t the grey &s;tone, of which the ruins are compo&s;ed, with the feathering foliage, that floated round them: but we had not time to examine, how all the&s;e beauteous parts were formed into a whole.&mdash;The ima|gination formed it, after the vi&s;ion vani&s;h|ed. But tho it might po&s;&s;ibly create a <HI>whole,</HI> more agreeable to the rules of paint|ing; yet it could &s;carce do ju&s;tice to the beauty of the <HI>parts.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Brecknoc,</HI> in our road to Treca&s;tle, we enter a country very different from the vale of U&s;k. This too is a vale: but nature always marks even kindred &s;cenes with &s;ome peculiar character. The vale of U&s;k is almo&s;t one continued winding &s;weep. The road <HI>now</HI> played among a variety of hills. The whole &s;eemed to con&s;i&s;t of one great vale divided into a multiplicity of parts. All together, they wanted unity; but &s;eparately, afforded a number
<PB N="94" REF="120">of tho&s;e plea&s;ing pa&s;&s;ages, which, trea&s;ured up in the memory, become the ingredients of future land&s;capes.</P>
<P>Sometimes the road, in&s;tead of winding round the hills, took the &s;horte&s;t way over them. In general, they are cultivated, like tho&s;e of the vale of U&s;k: but as the cultivation in many of them is brought too near the eye, it becomes rather offen&s;ive. Our be&s;t ideas were obtained from &s;uch, as were adorned with wood; and fell, in various forms, into the vallies below.</P>
<P>In the&s;e &s;cenes we lo&s;t the U&s;k, our &s;weet, playful companion in the vale: but other rivers of the &s;ame kind frequently met us, tho they &s;eldom continued long; di&s;|appearing in ha&s;te, and hiding them&s;elves among the little, tufted rece&s;&s;es, at the bottom of the hills.</P>
<P>In general, the Wel&s;h gentlemen, in the&s;e parts, &s;eem fond of whitening their hou&s;es, which gives them a di&s;agreeable glare. A <HI>&s;peck</HI> of white is often beautiful; but white, in <HI>profu&s;ion,</HI> is, of all tints, the mo&s;t in|harmonious. A white feat, at the corner of
<PB N="95" REF="121">a wood, or a few white cattle grazing in a meadow, inliven a &s;cene perhaps more, than if the &s;eat, or the cattle, had been of any other colour. They have meaning, and effect. But a front, and two &s;taring wings; an extent of rails; a huge, Chine&s;e bridge; the tower of a church; and a variety of other large objects, which we often &s;ee daubed over with white, make a di&s;agreeable ap|pearance; and unite ill with the general &s;implicity of nature's colouring.</P>
<P>Nature never colours in this offen&s;ive way. Her &s;urfaces are never white. The chalky cliff is the only permanent object of the kind, which &s;he allows to be her's; and this &s;eems rather a force upon her from the boi|&s;terous action of a furious element. But even here it is her con&s;tant endeavour to correct the offen&s;ive tint. She hangs her cliffs with &s;armphire, and other marine plants; or &s;he &s;tains them with various hues; &s;o as to remove, in part at lea&s;t, the di&s;gu&s;ting glare. The we&s;tern end of the i&s;le of Wight, called the Needle-cliffs, is a re|markable in&s;tance of this. The&s;e rocks are of a &s;ub&s;tance nearly re&s;embling chalk: but nature has &s;o reduced their unplea|&s;ant
<PB N="96" REF="122">lu&s;tre by a variety of cha&s;ti&s;ing tints, that in mo&s;t lights they have even a beau|tiful effect. She is continually at work al&s;o, in the &s;ame manner, on the white cliffs of Dover; tho her endeavours here are more counteracted by a greater expo&s;ure. But here, and in all other places, were it not for the intervention of foreign cau&s;es, &s;he would in time throw her green mantle over every na|ked and expo&s;ed part of her &s;urface.</P>
<P>In the&s;e remarks I mean only to in&s;inuate&mdash;that <HI>white</HI> is a hue, which nature &s;eems &s;tudious to expunge from all her works, ex|cept in the touch of a flower, an animal, a cloud, a wave, or &s;ome other diminutive, or tran&s;ient object&mdash;and that <HI>her mode</HI> of co|louring &s;hould always be the model of <HI>cur's.</HI></P>
<P>In animadverting however on <HI>white objects,</HI> I would only cen&s;ure the mere <HI>raw tint.</HI> It may ea&s;ily be corrected, and turned into &s;tone-colours of various hues; which tho light, if not too light, may often have a good effect.</P>
<P>Mr. Lock, who did me the favour to overlook the&s;e papers, made &s;ome remarks on this part of my &s;ubject, which are &s;o new, and &s;o excellent, that I cannot without im|propriety, take the credit of them my&s;elf.</P>
<Q><PB N="97" REF="123"><P>White offers a more extended &s;cale of light, and &s;hadow, than any other colour, when near; and is more &s;u&s;ceptible of the predominant tint of the air, when di&s;tant. The tran&s;parency of it's &s;hadows, (which in near objects partake &s;o little of darkne&s;s, that they are rather &s;econd lights) di&s;cover, without injuring the principal light, all the details of &s;urfaces.</P>
<P>I partake however of your general di&s;|like to the colour; and though I have &s;een a very <HI>&s;plendid effect</HI> from an <HI>accidental light</HI> on a white object; yet I think it a hue, which oftener injures, than it im|proves the &s;cene. It particularly di&s;turbs the air in it's office of graduating di&s;tances; &s;hews objects nearer, than they really are; and by pre&s;&s;ing them on the eye, often gives them an importance, which from their form, and &s;ituation, they are not intitled to.</P>
<P>The white of &s;now is &s;o active, and refractory, as to re&s;i&s;t the di&s;cipline of every harmonizing principle. I think I never &s;aw Mont Blanc, and the range of &s;nows, which run through Savoy, in union with the re&s;t of the land&s;cape, except when they
<PB N="98" REF="124">were tinged by the rays of the ri&s;ing, and &s;etting &s;un; or participated of &s;ome other tint of the &s;urrounding &s;ky. In the clear, and colourle&s;s days &s;o frequent in that country, the Glaciers are always out of tune.</P></Q>

<P>FROM Treca&s;tle we a&s;cended a &s;teep of three miles; which the country people call a <HI>pitch.</HI> It rai&s;ed us to a level with the neighbouring hills; who&s;e rugged &s;um|mits formed all the land&s;cape we had.

<P>Llandovery &s;tands at the entrance of the vale of Towy; which, like other vales, receives it's name from the river, that winds through it. This delightful &s;cene opened before us, as we left Llandovery, in our way to Llandilo; which &s;tands about twelve miles lower in the vale.</P>
<P>The vale of Towy is &s;till le&s;s a &s;cene of cultivation than that of U&s;k. The wood|land views are more frequent; and the whole more wild, and &s;imple. The &s;cenery &s;eems preci&s;ely of that kind, with which a great ma&s;ter in land&s;cape was formerly enamoured.</P>

<P>In this vale, the river Towy, tho it fre|quently met us, and always kept near us;

<P>This is the &s;cene, which Dyer celebrated, in his poem of <HI>Grongar-hill.</HI> Dyer was bred a painter; and had here a picture&s;que &s;ubject: but he does not give us &s;o good a land&s;cape, as might have been expected. We have no where a complete, formed di&s;tance; tho it is the great idea &s;ugge&s;ted by &s;uch a vale as this: no where any touches of that beautiful ob&s;curity, which melts a variety of objects into one rich whole.

<P><HI>Dinevawr-ca&s;tle,</HI> which &s;tands about a mile from Llandilo, and the &s;cenery around it, were the next objects of our curio&s;ity. This ca&s;tle is &s;eated on one of the &s;ides of the vale of Towy; where it occupies a bold eminence, richly adorned with wood. It was u&s;ed, not long ago, as a man&s;ion: but Mr. Rice, the proprietor of it, has built a hand&s;ome hou&s;e in his park, about a mile from the ca&s;tle; which, however, he &s;till pre&s;erves, as one of the greate&s;t ornaments of his place.</P>
<P>This ca&s;tle al&s;o is taken notice of by Dyer in his Grongar-hill; and &s;eems intended as an object in a di&s;tance. But <HI>his</HI> di&s;tances,
<PB REF="129"><FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="103" REF="130">I ob&s;erved, are all in confu&s;ion; and indeed it is not ea&s;y to &s;epavate them from his foregrounds.</P>
<P>The land&s;cape he gives us, in which the ca&s;tle of Dinevawr makes a part, is &s;een from the brow of a di&s;tant hill. The fir&s;t object, that meets his eye, is a wood. It is ju&s;t beneath him; and he ea&s;ily di&s;tin|gui&s;hes the &s;everal trees, of which it is compo&s;ed;
<Q><L>The gloomy pine, the poplar blue,</L>
<L>The yellow beech, the &s;able yew,</L>
<L>The &s;lender fir, that taper grows,</L>
<L>The &s;turdy oak, with broad-&s;pread boughs.</L></Q></P>
<P>This is perfectly right: objects &s;o near the eye &s;hould be di&s;tinctly marked. What next &s;trikes him, is a <HI>purple-grove;</HI> that is, I pre&s;ume, a grove, which has gained it's <HI>purple-hue</HI> from di&s;tance. This is, no doubt, very ju&s;t colouring; tho it is here, I think, introduced rather too early in the land&s;cape. The blue, and purple tints belong chiefly to the mo&s;t removed objects; which &s;eem not here to be intended. Thus far however I &s;hould not greatly cavil.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="131">The next object he &s;urveys, is a level lawn, from which a hill, crowned with a ca&s;tle, which is meant, I am informed, for that of Dinevawr, ari&s;es. Here his great want of <HI>keeping</HI> appears. His ca&s;tle, in|&s;tead of being marked with &s;till fainter colours, than the <HI>purple-grove,</HI> is touched with all the &s;trength of a foreground. You &s;ee the very ivy creeping upon it's walls. Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of this kind are common in de&s;criptive poetry. Innumerable in&s;tances might be collected from much better poems, than Grongar-hill. But I mention only the inaccuracies of an author, who, as a painter, &s;hould at lea&s;t have ob&s;erved the mo&s;t obvious principles of his art.&mdash;With how much more picture&s;que beauty does Milton introduce a di&s;tant ca&s;tle:
<Q><L>Towers, and battlements he &s;ees,</L>
<L>Bo&s;omed high in tufted trees.</L></Q></P>
<P>Here we have all the indi&s;tinct: colouring, which ob&s;cures a di&s;tant object. We do not &s;ee the iron-grated window, the port|cullis, the ditch, or the rampart. We can ju&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h a ca&s;tle from a tree; and a tower from a battlement.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="132">The &s;cenery around Dinevawr-ca&s;tle is very beautiful; con&s;i&s;ting of a rich pro|fu&s;ion of wood, and lawn. But what par|ticularly recommends it, is the great variety of the ground. I know few places, where a painter might &s;tudy the inequalities of a &s;urface with more advantage.</P>
<P>Nothing gives &s;o ju&s;t an idea of the beau|tiful &s;wellings of ground, as tho&s;e of water; where it has &s;ufficient room to undulate, and expand. In ground, which is compo&s;ed of refractory materials, you are pre&s;ented often with har&s;h lines, angular in&s;ertions, and di&s;|agreeable abruptne&s;&s;es. In water, whether in gentle, or in agitated motion, all is ea&s;y; all is &s;oftened into it&s;elf; and the hills and the vallies play into each other in a va|riety of beautiful forms. In agitated water abruptne&s;&s;es indeed there are; but yet they are &s;uch as, in &s;ome part or other, unite properly with the &s;urface around them; and are, on the whole, perfectly harmonious. Now if the ocean, in any of the&s;e &s;wellings, and agitations, could be arre&s;ted, and fixed, it would produce that plea&s;ing variety, which
<PB N="106" REF="133">we admire in ground. Hence it is common to fetch our images from water, and apply them to land. We talk of an undulating line, a playing lawn, and a billowy &s;urface; and give a much &s;tronger, and more adequate idea, by &s;uch imagery, than plain language can po&s;&s;ibly pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The woods, which adorn the&s;e beautiful &s;cenes about Dinevawr-ca&s;tle, and which are clumped with great beauty, con&s;i&s;t chiefly of the fine&s;t oak; &s;ome of them of large Spani&s;h che&s;nuts. There are a few, and but a few, young plantations.</P>
<P>The picture&s;que &s;cenes, which this place affords, are numerous. Wherever the ca&s;tle appears, and it appears almo&s;t every where, a land&s;cape purely picture&s;que is generally pre|&s;ented. The ground is &s;o beautifully di&s;po&s;ed, that it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to have bad com|po&s;ition. And the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the vale often appears as a back-ground; and makes a plea&s;ing di&s;tance.</P>

<P><PB N="108" REF="136">As we returned from Dinevawr-ca&s;tle, into the road, a noble &s;cene opened before us.

<P>FROM Dinevawr-ca&s;tle we &s;et out, acro&s;s the country, for Neath. A good turn|pike-road, we were a&s;&s;ured, would lead us thither: but we were told much of the diffi|culty of pa&s;&s;ing <HI>the mountain,</HI> as they empha|tically call a ridge of very high ground, which lay before us.</P>
<P>Though we had left the vale of Towy, the country continued to wear the &s;ame face of hill, and dale, which it had &s;o long worn. On the right, we had &s;till a di&s;tant view of the &s;cenery of Dinevawr-ca&s;tle; which appeared like a grand, woody bank. The woods al&s;o of Golden-grove varied the &s;cene. Soon after, other ca&s;tles, &s;eated lof|tily on ri&s;ing grounds, adorned other vales;
<PB N="110" REF="139">Tru&s;lan-ca&s;tle on the right, and Kirkennel on the left.</P>
<P>But all the&s;e beautiful &s;cenes, by degrees, were clo&s;ed. Ca&s;tles, and winding rivers, and woody banks were left behind, one after ano|ther; and we approached, nearer and nearer, the bleak mountain; which &s;pread it's dark mantle athwart the view.</P>
<P>It did not however approach precipitately. Tho it had long blotted out all di&s;tance; yet it's environs afforded a pre&s;ent &s;cene; and partook of the beautiful country we had pa&s;&s;ed. The ground about it's foot was agreeably di&s;|po&s;ed; &s;welling into a variety of little knolls, covered with oak; which a foaming rivulet, winding along, &s;haped into tufted i&s;lands, and penin&s;ulas of different forms; wearing away the &s;oil in &s;ome parts from the roots of the trees; and in others delving deep channels: while the mountain afforded a dark, &s;olemn background to the whole.</P>
<P>At length we began to a&s;cend it's &s;teeps; but before we had ri&s;en too high, we turned
<PB N="111" REF="140">round to take a retro&s;pect of all the rich &s;cenes together, which we had left behind. It was a noble view; di&s;tance melting into di&s;tance; till the whole was clo&s;ed by a &s;emi|circle of azure mountains, &s;carce di&s;tingui&s;h|able from the azure &s;ky, which ab&s;orbed them.</P>
<P>Still a&s;cending the &s;piral road round the &s;haggy &s;ide of the mountain, we arrived at, what is called it's <HI>gate.</HI> Here all idea of cultivation cea&s;ed. That was not deplorable: but with it our turnpike-road cea&s;ed al&s;o; which was fini&s;hed, on this &s;ide, no farther than the <HI>mountain-gate.</HI> We had gotten a guide however to conduct us over the path|le&s;s de&s;art. But it being too &s;teep, and rug|ged to a&s;cend on wheels, we were obliged to lighten our carriage, and a&s;cend on foot.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of our labour, our guide called out, that he &s;aw a &s;torm coming on, along the tops of the mountains; a circum&s;tance indeed, which in the&s;e hilly countries, cannot often be avoided. We a&s;ked him, How far it was off? He an&s;wered, Ten minutes. In le&s;s time, &s;ky, mountains, vallies were all wrapt in one cloud of driving rain and ob|&s;curity.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="141">Our recompence con&s;i&s;ted in following with our eye the rear of the &s;torm; ob&s;erving through it's broken &s;kirts, a thou&s;and beautiful effects, and half-formed images, which were continually opening, lo&s;t, and varying; till the &s;un breaking out, the whole re&s;plendent land&s;cape appeared again, with double radi|ance, under the leaden gloom of the retiring tempe&s;t.</P>
<P>When we arrived at the top of the moun|tain, we found a level plain; which continued at lea&s;t two miles. It was a noble terrace; but was too widely &s;pread, to give us a di&s;play of much di&s;tant &s;cenery.</P>
<P>At length, we began to de&s;cend the moun|tain; and &s;oon met an excellent turnpike-road, down which we &s;lid &s;wiftly, in an elegant &s;piral; and found, when we came to the bottom, that we had &s;pent near four hours in &s;urmounting this great ob&s;truction.</P>
<P>Having thus pa&s;&s;ed the mount Cenis of this country, we fell into the &s;ame kind of beautiful &s;cenery on this &s;ide of it, which we had left on the other: only here the &s;cene
<PB N="113" REF="142">was continually &s;hifting, as if by magical interpo&s;ition.</P>
<P>We were fir&s;t pre&s;ented with a view of a deep, woody glen, lying below us; which the eye could not penetrate, re&s;ting only on the tops, and tuftings of the trees.</P>
<P>This &s;uddenly vani&s;hed; and a grand, rocky bank aro&s;e in front; richly adorned with wood.</P>
<P>It was in&s;tantly gone; and we were &s;hut up in a clo&s;e, woody lane.</P>
<P>In a moment, the lane opened on the right, and we had a view of an inchanting vale.</P>
<P>We caught it's beauties as a vi&s;ion only. In an in&s;tant, they fled; and in their room aro&s;e two bold woody promontories. We could ju&s;t di&s;cover between them, as they floated pa&s;t, a creek, or the mouth of a river, or a channel of the &s;ea; we knew not what it was: but it &s;eemed divided by a &s;tretch of land of dingy hue; which ap|peared like a &s;and-bank.</P>
<P>This &s;cene &s;hifting, immediately aro&s;e, on our left, a va&s;t hill, covered with wood; through which, here and there, projected huge ma&s;&s;es of rock.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="143">In a few moments it vani&s;hed, and a grove of trees &s;uddenly &s;hot up in it's room.</P>
<P>But before we could even di&s;cover of what &s;pecies they were, the rocky hill, which had ju&s;t appeared on the left, winding rapidly round, pre&s;ented it&s;elf full in front. It had now acquired a more tremendous form. The wood, which had before hid it's terrors, was now gone; and the rocks were all left, in their native wildne&s;s, every where bur&s;ting from the &s;oil.</P>
<P>Many of the objects, which had floated &s;o rapidly pa&s;t us, if we had had time to exa|mine them, would have given us &s;ublime, and beautiful hints in land&s;cape: &s;ome of them &s;eemed even well combined, and ready prepared for the pencil: but, in &s;o quick a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, one blotted out another.&mdash;The country at length giving way on both fides, a view opened, which &s;uffered the eye to re&s;t upon it.</P>
<P>The river Neath, covered with &s;hipping, was &s;pread before us. It's banks were inriched with wood; amid&s;t which aro&s;e the ruins of Neath-abbey, with it's double

<P>AS we left Neath, a grand vi&s;ta of woody mountains, pur&s;uing each other along the river, and forming, no doubt, &s;ome inchanting vale, if we had had time to examine it, &s;tretched into remote di&s;tance.</P>
<P>The vi&s;tas of art are tame, and formal. They con&s;i&s;t of &s;treets, with the unvarying repetition of doors, and windows&mdash;or they con&s;i&s;t of trees planted nicely in rows; a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of mere vegetable columns&mdash;or they con&s;i&s;t of &s;ome other &s;pecies of regularity. But nature's vi&s;tas are of a different ca&s;t. She forms them &s;ometimes of mountains, &s;ometimes of rocks, and &s;ometimes of woods. But all her works even of this formal kind, are the works of a ma&s;ter. If the idea of regularity be impre&s;&s;ed on the <HI>general form,</HI> the <HI>parts</HI> are broken with a thou&s;and varieties.
<PB N="118" REF="147">Her vi&s;tas are models to paint from.&mdash;In <HI>this</HI> before us, both the mountains them|&s;elves were beautiful; and the per&s;pective combination of them.</P>
<P>The broken ground about a copper-work, a little beyond the town, would afford hints for a noble land&s;cape. Two contiguous hills appear as if riven a&s;under; and lay open a very picture&s;que &s;cene of rocky fragments, inter&s;per&s;ed with wood; through which a torrent, forcing it's way, forms two or three ca&s;cades, before it reaches the bottom.</P>
<P>A little beyond this, the views, which had entertained us, as we entered Neath, entertained us a &s;econd time, as we left it. The river, covered with &s;hipping, pre&s;ented it&s;elf again. The woody &s;cenery aro&s;e on it's banks: and the abbey appeared among the woods; tho in different per&s;pective, and in a more removed &s;ituation.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="148">Here too we were again pre&s;ented with tho&s;e two woody promontories, which we had &s;een before, with a creek, or channel between them, divided by what &s;eemed a &s;and-bank. We had now approached much nearer, and found we had been right in our conjecture. The exten&s;ive object we had &s;een, was the bank of Margam; which, when the &s;ea retires, is a va&s;t, &s;andy flat.</P>
<P>From hence we had, for a con&s;iderable time, continued views, on the left, of grand, woody promontories, pur&s;uing each other, all rich to profu&s;ion; with &s;ea-views on the right. Such an intermixture of high|lands, and &s;ea, where the objects are beautiful, and well di&s;po&s;ed, makes, in general, a very plea&s;ing mode of compo&s;ition. The rough|ne&s;s of the mountains above, and the &s;mooth expan&s;e of the waters below, wonderfully aid each other by the force of contra&s;t.</P>
<P>From the&s;e views we were hurried, at once, upon a black &s;ea-coa&s;t; which gave
<PB N="120" REF="149">a kind of relief to the eye, &s;urfeited with rich land&s;cape to &s;atiety. Margam-&s;and-bank, which, &s;een partially, afforded a &s;weet, cha&s;ti&s;ing tint to the verdure of the woody promontories, through which we had twice &s;een it; became now (when un&s;upported, and &s;pread abroad in all it's exten&s;ion) a cold, di&s;gu&s;ting object.&mdash;But relief was every where at hand; and we &s;eldom &s;aw it long, without &s;ome intervention of woody &s;cenery.</P>
<P>As we approached the river Abravon, our views degenerated &s;till more. Margam|&s;and-bank, which was now only the boundary of mar&s;hes, became offen&s;ive to the eye: and tho, on the left, the woody hills continued &s;till &s;hooting after us, yet they had lo&s;t their plea&s;ing &s;hapes. No variety of breaks, like the members of architecture, gave a lightne&s;s, and elegance to their forms. No mantling furniture inve&s;ted their &s;ides; nor tufted fringe adorned their promontories; nor clumps of &s;cattered oak di&s;covered the &s;ky, through inter&s;tices, along their towering &s;ummits. In&s;tead of this, they had de|generated
<PB N="121" REF="150">into mere uniform lumps of matter; and were every where over&s;pread with one heavy, uninterrupted bu&s;h.</P>
<P>Of this kind were Lord Man&s;ell's woods, which covered a promontory. Time, with it's lenient hand, may hereafter hang new beauties upon the&s;e hills; when it has cor|rected their heavine&s;s, by improving the lux|uriance of youthful foliage into the lighter forms of aged trees.</P>
<P>From Lord Man&s;ell's to Pyle, which &s;tands on a bleak coa&s;t, the &s;pirit of the country is totally lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Here we found the people employed in &s;ending provi&s;ions to the &s;hore, where a Dutch We&s;t-India &s;hip had ju&s;t been wrecked. Fifteen lives were lo&s;t; and among them the whole family of a Zealand merchant, who was bring|ing his children for education to Am&s;terdam. The populace came down in large bodies to pillage the wreck; which the officers of the cu&s;toms, and gentlemen of the country, a&s;|&s;embled to protect.&mdash;It was a bu&s;y &s;cene, compo&s;ed of multitudes of men, carts, hor&s;es, and hor&s;emen.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="151">The bu&s;tle of a croud is not ill-adapted to the pencil: but the management of it requires great artifice. The whole mu&s;t be ma&s;&s;ed together, and con&s;idered as one body.</P>
<P>I mean not to have the whole body &s;o agglomerated, as to con&s;i&s;t of no detached groups: but to have the&s;e groups (of which there &s;hould not be more than two or three) appear to belong to one whole, by the artifice of compo&s;ition, and the effect of light.</P>
<P>This great whole mu&s;t be varied al&s;o in it's parts. It is not enough to &s;tick bodies and heads together. Figures mu&s;t be con|tra&s;ted with figures; and life, &s;pirit, and action mu&s;t pervade the whole.</P>
<P>Thus in managing a croud, and in mana|ging a land&s;cape, the &s;ame general rules are to be ob&s;erved. Tho the <HI>parts</HI> mu&s;t be <HI>con|tra&s;ted,</HI> the <HI>whole</HI> mu&s;t be <HI>combined.</HI> But the difficulty is the greater in a croud; as it's parts, con&s;i&s;ting of animated bodies, require a nicer ob&s;ervation of form: being all &s;imilar
<PB N="123" REF="152">likewi&s;e, they require more art in the com|bination of them.</P>
<P><HI>Compo&s;ition</HI> indeed has never a more difficult work, than when it is engaged in combining a croud. When a number of people, all coloured alike, are to be drawn up in rank and file; it is not in the art of man to combine them in a picture&s;que manner. We can in|troduce a rencounter of hor&s;e, where all re|gularity is broken&mdash;or we can exhibit a few general officers, with their aids de camp, on the foreground, and cover a fighting army with &s;moke at a di&s;tance; but the files of war, the regiment, or &s;quadron in military array, admit no picture&s;que compo&s;ition. Modern heroes therefore mu&s;t not look to have their achievements recorded on canvas, till they abrogate their formal arts.&mdash;But even when we take all the advantages of &s;hape, and colour, with which the human form can be varied, or cloathed, we find it &s;till a matter of difficulty enough.</P>
<P>I do not immediately recollect having &s;een a croud better managed, than Hogarth has managed one in the la&s;t print of his idle prentice. In combining the multifarious com|pany, which attends the &s;pectacle of an exe|cution,
<PB N="124" REF="153">he hath exemplified all the ob&s;ervations I have made. I have not the print before me; but I have often admired it in this light: nor do I recollect ob&s;erving any thing offen&s;ive in it; which is rare in the management of &s;uch a multitude of figures.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject before us is as well adapted, as any &s;pecies of croud can be, to exhibit the beauties of compo&s;ition. Hor&s;es, carts, and men, make a good a&s;&s;emblage: and this va|riety in the parts would appear to great ad|vantage in contra&s;t with the &s;implicity of a winding &s;hore; and of a &s;tranded &s;hip, (a large, dark object,) heeling on one &s;ide, in a corner of the piece.</P>

<P>FROM Pyle the country grows &s;till wor&s;e, till at la&s;t it degenerates into a vile heath; and continues a long time totally unadorned, or at be&s;t with a few tran&s;ient beauties.</P>
<P>At <HI>Bridgend,</HI> where we meet the river Og|more, a beautiful land&s;cape bur&s;ts again upon us. Woody banks ari&s;e on both &s;ides; on the right e&s;pecially, which continue a con|&s;iderable way, marking the cour&s;e of the liver. On the left is a rich di&s;tance.</P>
<P>From hence we pa&s;s in view of cultivated vallies, into which the rich di&s;tance, we had ju&s;t &s;een, began to form it&s;elf: while the road winds over a kind of terrace above them.
<PB N="126" REF="155">An old ca&s;tle, al&s;o inriches the &s;cene; till at length the terrace giving way, we &s;ink into the vale; and enter Cowbridge.</P>
<P>The heights beyond Cowbridge give us the fir&s;t view of the Bri&s;tol channel on the right. The country between the eye and the water has a mar&s;hy appearance; but being well blended, and the lines broken, it makes a tolerable di&s;tance. The road pa&s;&s;es through plea&s;ant inclo&s;ed lanes.</P>
<P>At the fifth &s;tone, before we reached Car|diff, we had a mo&s;t grand, and exten&s;ive view, from the heights of Clanditham. It contained an immen&s;e &s;tretch of country, melt|ing gradually into a faint blue &s;emicircle of mountains, which edged the horizon.&mdash;This &s;cene indeed, painted in &s;yllables, words, and &s;entences, appears very like &s;ome of the &s;cenes we had met with before: but in na|ture it was very different from any of them.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="156">In di&s;tant views of cultivated countries, &s;een from lofty &s;tands; the parts, which lie neare&s;t the eye, are commonly di&s;gu&s;ting. The di|vi&s;ions of property into &s;quares, rhomboids, and other mathematical forms, are unplea|&s;ant. A view of this kind therefore does not a&s;&s;ume it's beauty, till you de&s;cend a little into the vale; till the hedgrows begin to lengthen; and form tho&s;e agreeable <HI>di&s;cri|minations,</HI> of which Virgil <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>&mdash; et lat&egrave; di&s;criminat agros.
<BIBL>AEn. II. 144.</BIBL></Q></NOTE> takes notice; where fields, and meadows become extended &s;treaks; and yet are broken in various parts by ri&s;ing grounds, ca&s;tles, and other objects, with which di&s;tances abound: melting away from the eye, in one general azure tint; ju&s;t, here and there, diver&s;ified with a few lines of light and &s;hade; and dotted with a few indi&s;tinct objects. Then, if we are &s;o happy as to find a ruin, a &s;preading tree, a bold rock, or &s;ome other object, large enough, with it's appendages to become a foreground, and balance the di&s;tance, (&s;uch as we found
<PB N="128" REF="157">among the abrupt heights of Cote&s;wold <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 10.</NOTE>;) we have the chance of being pre&s;ented with a noble picture, which <HI>di&s;tance alone</HI> cannot give.</P>
<P>Hence appears the ab&s;urdity of carrying a painter to the top of a high hill, to take a view. He cannot do it. Exten&s;ion alone, tho amu&s;ing in nature, will never make a picture. It <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be <HI>&s;upported.</HI></P>
<P>Cardiff lies low; tho it is not unplea&s;antly &s;eated, on the land-&s;ide, among woody hills. As we <HI>approached,</HI> it appeared with more of the furniture of antiquity about it, than any town we had &s;een in Wales: but <HI>on the &s;pot</HI> the picture&s;que eye finds it too intire to be in full perfection. The ca&s;tle, which was formerly the pri&s;on of the unfortunate Robert, &s;on of William the fir&s;t, who langui&s;hed here the la&s;t twenty years of his life, is &s;till, I believe, a pri&s;on, and in good repair.</P>
<P>From the town and parts adjacent, the windings and approach of the river Tave from the &s;ea, with a full tide, make a grand ap|pearance. This is, on the whole, the fine&s;t e&s;tuary, we had &s;een in Wales.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="158">From the heights beyond Cardiff, the views of the channel, on the right, continue; and of the Wel&s;h mountains on the left. The Sugar-loaf, near Abergavenny, appears &s;till di&s;tinctly. The road leads through inclo&s;ed lanes.</P>
<P>Newport lies plea&s;antly on a declivity. A good view might be taken from the retro&s;pect of the river, the bridge, and the ca&s;tle. A few &s;light alterations would make it pic|ture&s;que.</P>
<P>Beyond Newport &s;ome of the views of the channel were finer than any we had &s;een. The coa&s;t, tho it continues flat, be|comes more woody, and the parts are larger.</P>
<P>About &s;even miles from Newport, the road winds among woody hills; which, here and there, form beautiful dips at their inter&s;ections. On one of the&s;e knolls &s;tand the ruins of a
<PB N="130" REF="159">ca&s;tle; which has once made a grand appea|rance; but it is now degraded into a modern dwelling.</P>
<P>As we approached the pa&s;&s;age over the Bri&s;tol channel, the views of it became &s;till more intere&s;ting. On the right, we left the magnificent ruins of Caldicot-ca&s;tle; and ar|rived at the ferry-hou&s;e, about three in the afternoon, where we were &s;o fortunate as to find the boat preparing to &s;et &s;ail. It had attempted to cro&s;s at high water, in the morning: but after toiling three hours again&s;t the wind, it was obliged to put back. This afforded another opportunity, when the water was at ebb: for the boat can pa&s;s only at the two extremes of the tide; and &s;eldom oftener than once in a day.</P>
<P>We had &s;carce alighted at the ferry-hou&s;e, when we heard the boatman winding his horn from the beach, about a quarter of a mile below, as a &s;ignal to bring down the hor&s;es. When they were all embarked, the horn &s;ounded again for the pa&s;&s;engers. A very multifarious company a&s;&s;embled; and a mi|&s;erable walk we had to the boat through
<PB N="131" REF="160">&s;ludge; and over &s;helving, and &s;lippery rocks. When we got to it, we found eleven hor&s;es on board, and above thirty people; and our chai&s;e (which we had intended to convert into a cabin during the voyage) &s;lung into the &s;hrouds.</P>
<P>The boat, after &s;ome &s;truggling with the &s;helves, at length gained the channel. The wind was unfavourable, which obliged us to make &s;everal <HI>tacks,</HI> as the &s;eamen phra&s;e them. The&s;e tacks occa&s;ioned a fluttering in the &s;ail: and this produced a fermentation among the hor&s;es; till their fears reduced them again to order.</P>
<P>Livy gives us a beautiful picture of the terror of cattle, in a &s;cene of this kind.&mdash;<Q>Primus erat pavor, quum, &s;oluta rati, in alturn raperentur. Ibi urgentes inter &s;e, cedentibus extremis ab aqu&acirc;, trepidationem aliquantam edebant; donec quietem ip&s;e timor circum|&s;picientibus aquam feci&s;&s;et<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. XXI. cap. xxviii.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="161">The &s;cenery of this &s;hort voyage was of little value. We had not here the &s;teep, fold|ing banks of the Wye to produce a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of new land&s;capes. Our picture now was motionle&s;s. From the beginning: to the end of the voyage, it continued the &s;ame. It was only a di&s;play of water; varied by that little change introduced by di&s;tance, on a coa&s;t, which &s;een from &s;o low a point, as the &s;urface of the water, became a mere thread. The &s;creens bore no proportion to the area.</P>
<P>After beating near two hours again&s;t the wind our voyage concluded, as it began, with an uncomfortable walk through the &s;ludge, to the high-water mark.</P>
<P>The wor&s;t part of the affair, is, the u&s;age of hor&s;es. If they are unruly, or any accident occurs, there is hardly a po&s;&s;ibility, at lea&s;t if the ve&s;&s;el be crouded, of affording them relief. Early in our voyage, as the boat heeled, one of the poor animals fell down. Many an ineffectual &s;truggle it made to ri&s;e; but nothing could be done, till we arrived at the other &s;ide.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="162">The operation too of landing hor&s;es, is equally di&s;agreeable. They are forced out of the boat, through an aperture in the &s;ide of it; which is &s;o inconvenient a mode of egre&s;s, that in leaping, many have been hurt from the difficulty of de&s;engaging their hinder ledgs.</P>
<P>This pa&s;&s;age, as well as the other over the Severn (for there is one al&s;o a little above) are often e&s;teemed dangerous. The tides are uncommonly rapid in this chan|nel; and when a bri&s;k wind happens to blow in a contrary direction, the waters are very rough. The boats too are often ill-managed; for what is done repeatedly, is often done carele&s;sly. A Briti&s;h admiral, I have heard, who had lived much at &s;ea, riding up to one of the&s;e ferries, with an intention to pa&s;s over, and ob&s;erving the boat, as &s;he was working acro&s;s the channel from the other &s;ide, he declared he dur&s;t not tru&s;t him&s;elf to the &s;eaman&s;hip of &s;uch fellows as managed her; and turning his hor&s;e, went round by Gloce&s;ter.</P>
<P>Several melancholy accidents indeed within the cour&s;e of a dozen years, have thrown di&s;credit on the&s;e ferries. One I had from a gentleman, who him&s;elf providentially e&s;caped being lo&s;t. He went to the beach,
<PB N="134" REF="163">ju&s;t as the ve&s;&s;el was unmooring. His hor&s;e had been embarked before, together with &s;ixty head of cattle. A pa&s;&s;age with &s;uch company appeared &s;o di&s;agreeable, that he, and about &s;ix or &s;even pa&s;&s;engers more, whom he found on the beach, among whom was a young lady, agreed to get into an open boat, and be towed over by the large one.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;age was rough, and they ob&s;erved the cattle on board the larger ve&s;&s;el, rather trouble&s;ome. About half way over, an ox, which &s;tood near the aperture in the &s;ide of the ve&s;&s;el, mentioned above for the entrance, and egre&s;s of cattle, intangled his horn in a wooden &s;lider, which clo&s;es it, and which happened, according to the carele&s;s cu&s;tom of boatmen, to be unpin|ned. The bea&s;t finding his head fixed, and endeavouring to di&s;engage him&s;elf, drew up the &s;lider. The ve&s;&s;el heeled; the tide ru&s;hed in; and all was in&s;tant confu&s;ion. The dan|ger, and the impo&s;&s;ibility of oppo&s;ing it, in &s;uch a croud, &s;truck every one at once.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the pa&s;&s;engers in the open boat, who were equally con&s;cious of the ruin, had nothing left, but to cut
<PB N="135" REF="164">the rope, which tied them to the &s;inking ve&s;&s;el. But not a knife could be found in the whole company. After much con|fu&s;ion, a little, neat, tortoi&s;e-&s;hell penknife was produced; with which unequal in&s;tru|ment they ju&s;t got the rope &s;evered, when the large ve&s;&s;el, and all it's contents, went down. All on board peri&s;hed, except two or three oxen, which were &s;een float|ing on the &s;urface; and it was believed got to &s;hore.</P>
<P>The joy of the pa&s;&s;engers in the boat was however &s;hort-lived. It &s;oon appeared they had e&s;caped only one mode of death. They were left to them&s;elves in a wide expan&s;e of water; at the mercy of a tide, ebbing with a violent current to the &s;ea; without oars, or &s;ail; and without one per&s;on on board, who had ever handled either. A gentleman among them had ju&s;t authority enough to keep them all quiet; without which their &s;afety could not have been in&s;ured a moment. He then took up a paddle, the only in&s;trument on board, with an intention, if po&s;&s;ible, to get the boat on &s;hore. But the young lady, who was his niece, throwing her arms around
<PB N="136" REF="165">him, in an agony of di&s;tre&s;s not knowing what &s;he did, would not let him proceed. He was obliged to quiet her by threatening in a furious tone to &s;trike her down in&s;tantly with the oar, if &s;he did not de&s;i&s;t. Not|with&s;tanding all his efforts, they were hurried away by the ebbing waters, as far as King|road; where the violence of the tide &s;lackening, he prevented the boat from going out to &s;ea; and got her by degrees to &s;hore.</P>
<P>The gentleman, who told me this &s;tory, I ob&s;erved, was one of the per&s;ons, who were &s;aved. From him I had the account of the lo&s;s of an open boat, in the &s;ame pa&s;&s;age, from the ob&s;tinacy of a pa&s;&s;enger.</P>
<P>The wind was rough, and a per&s;on on board lo&s;t his hat; which floated away in a contrary direction. He begged the waterman to turn round to recover it: but the waterman told him, it was as much as their lives were worth to attempt it. On which the pa&s;|&s;enger, who &s;eemed to be a trade&s;man, &s;tarted up, &s;ei&s;ed the helm, and &s;wore the fellow &s;hould return. In the &s;truggle, the helm got a wrong twi&s;t, and the boat in&s;tantly filled, and went to the bottom. It appeared afterwards that the hat was a hat of value;
<PB N="137" REF="166">for the owner had &s;ecreted &s;everal bills in the lining of it.</P>
<P>For our&s;elves however we found the pa&s;&s;age only a di&s;agreeable one; and if there was any danger, we &s;aw it not. The danger chiefly, I &s;uppo&s;e, ari&s;es from carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, and over|loading the boat.</P>
<P>As our chai&s;e could not be landed, till the tide flowed up the beach, we were obliged to wait at the ferry-hou&s;e. Our windows overlooked the channel, and the Wel&s;h-coa&s;t, which &s;een from a higher &s;tand, became now a woody, and beautiful di&s;tance. The wind was bri&s;k, and the &s;un clear; except that, at intervals, it was intercepted by a few float|ing clouds. The playing lights, which aro&s;e from this circum&s;tance, on the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t, were very picture&s;que. Pur&s;uing each other, they &s;ometimes ju&s;t caught the tufted tops of trees; then gleaming behind &s;hadowy woods, they &s;pread along the vales, till they faded in&s;en&s;ibly away.</P>
<P>Often the&s;e partial lights are more &s;ta|tionary; when the clouds, which fling their lengthened &s;hadows on di&s;tant grounds, hang,
<PB N="138" REF="167">&s;ome time, balanced in the air. But when|ever found, or from whatever &s;ource derived, the painter ob&s;erves them with the greate&s;t accuracy: he marks their different appear|ances; and lays them up in his memory among the choice ingredients of di&s;tant land&s;cape. Almo&s;t alone they are &s;ufficient to vary di&s;|tance. A <HI>multiplicity of objects,</HI> melted har|moniou&s;ly together, contribute to <HI>inrich</HI> it; but without throwing in tho&s;e <HI>gleaming lights,</HI> the arti&s;t can hardly avoid <HI>heavine&s;s</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When the &s;hadows of floating clouds fall upon the &s;ides of mountains, they have a bad effect.&mdash;See Picture&s;que Ob|&s;ervat. on Scotch land&s;cape, vol.

<P>FROM the ferry-hou&s;e to Bri&s;tol, the views are amu&s;ing. The fir&s;t &s;cene pre&s;ented to us, was a &s;pacious lawn, about a mile in diameter, the area of which was flat; and the boundary, a grand, woody bank; adorned with towers and villas, &s;tanding either boldly near the top; or &s;eated in woody re|ce&s;&s;es near the bottom. The horizon line is well varied, and broken.</P>
<P>The whole of this land&s;cape is too large; and not characterized enough to make a pic|ture; but the contra&s;t between the plain, and the wood, both of which are objects of equal grandeur, is plea&s;ing: and many of the parts, taken &s;eparately, would form into good com|po&s;ition.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="169">When we left the plain, the road carried us into &s;hady lanes, winding round woody eminences; one of which was crowned with an artificial ca&s;tle. The ca&s;tle indeed, which con&s;i&s;ted of one tower, might have been better imagined: the effect however was good, tho the object was paltry.</P>
<P>About three miles on this &s;ide of Bri&s;tol, we had a grand view of ri&s;ing country. It con&s;i&s;ted of a plea&s;ing mixture of wood, and lawn: the parts were large: and the hou&s;es, and villages &s;cattered in good proportion. The whole, when we &s;aw it, was over&s;pread with a purpli&s;h tint, which, as the objects were &s;o near, we could not account for; but it united all the parts together in very plea&s;ing harmony.</P>
<P>Nature's land&s;capes are generally harmo|nized. Whether the &s;ky is inlightened, or whether it lowers; whether it is tinted, or whether it is untinted, it gives it's yellow lu&s;tre, or it's grey ob&s;curity, to the &s;urface of the earth. It is but &s;eldom however, that
<PB N="141" REF="170">we meet with tho&s;e <HI>&s;trong harmonizing tints,</HI> which the land&s;cape before us pre&s;ented.</P>
<P>As the air is the vehicle of the&s;e tints, di&s;tant objects will of cour&s;e participate of them in the greate&s;t degree; the foregrounds will be little affected, as they are <HI>&s;een</HI> only through a very thin veil of air. But when the painter thinks it proper to introduce the&s;e &s;trong tints into his di&s;tances, he will give his foregrounds likewi&s;e in &s;ome degree, a participating hue; more perhaps than in real|ity belongs to them; or, at lea&s;t, he will work them up with &s;uch colours, mute, or vivid, as accord be&s;t with the general tone of his land&s;cape.&mdash;How far it is proper for him to attempt the&s;e uncommon ap|pearances of nature, is not a decided que&s;tion. If the land&s;cape before us &s;hould be painted with that full purple glow, with which we &s;aw it over&s;pread; the connoi&s;&s;eur would probably take offence, and call it affected.</P>
<P>The approach to Bri&s;tol is grand; and the environs every where &s;hew the neighbour|hood of an opulent city; tho the city it&s;elf lay concealed, till we entered it. For a
<PB N="142" REF="171">con&s;iderable way, the road led between &s;tone|walls, which bounded the fields on each &s;ide. This boundary, tho, of all others, the mo&s;t unplea&s;ing, is yet proper as you approach a great town: it is a kind of connecting thread.</P>
<P>The narrowne&s;s of the port of Bri&s;tol, which is formed by the banks of the river, is very &s;triking. It may be called a dry harbour, notwith&s;tanding the river: for the ve&s;&s;els, when the tide ebbs, lie on an ouzy bed, in a deep channel. The returning tide lifts them to the height of the wharfs. It exhibits of cour&s;e none of tho&s;e beautiful winding &s;hores, which often adorn an e&s;tuary. The port of Bri&s;tol was probably fir&s;t formed, when ve&s;&s;els, afraid of being cut from their harbours by cor&s;airs, ran up high into the country for &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>The great church is a remnant only of the ancient fabric. It has been a noble pile, when the nave was complete, and the &s;tunted tower crowned with a &s;pire, as I &s;uppo&s;e, it once was. We were &s;orry we did not look into Ratcliff-church, which is &s;aid to be an elegant piece of Gothic architecture.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="172">The country around Bri&s;tol is beautiful; tho we had not time to examine it. The &s;cenery about the Hot-wells is in a great degree picture&s;que. The river is cooped between two high hills; both of which are adorned with a rich profu&s;ion of rock, wood, and verdure. Here is no off&s;kip indeed; but as far as <HI>foregrounds</HI> alone make a picture, (and they will do much better alone, than <HI>di&s;tances</HI>) we are pre&s;ented with a very beau|tiful one.&mdash;Between the&s;e hills &s;tands the pump-room, clo&s;e to the river; and every &s;hip, that &s;ails into Bri&s;tol, fails under it's windows.</P>
<P>The road between Bri&s;tol and Bath contains very little worth notice. We had been informed of &s;ome grand retro&s;pect: views; but we did not find them. We were told afterwards, that there are two roads between Bath and Bri&s;tol; of which the Gloce&s;ter|&s;hire road is the more picture&s;que. If &s;o, we unfortunately took the wrong one.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="173">At Bath the buildings are &s;trikingly &s;plen|did: but the picture&s;que eye finds little amu&s;e|ment among &s;uch objects. The circus, from a corner of one of the &s;treets, that run into it, is thrown into per&s;pective; and if it be happily inlightened, is &s;een with advantage. The cre&s;cent is built in a &s;impler, and greater &s;tyle of architecture.</P>
<P>I have heard an ingenious friend, Col. Mit|ford, who is well-ver&s;ed in the theory of the picture&s;que, &s;peak of a very beautiful, and grand effect of light, and &s;hade, which he had &s;ometimes ob&s;erved from an afternoon-fun, in a bright winter-day, on this &s;tructure. No &s;uch effect could happen in &s;ummer; as the &s;un, in the &s;ame meridian, would be then too high. A grand ma&s;s of light, falling on one &s;ide of the Cre&s;cent, melted imper|ceptibly into as grand a body of &s;hade on the other; and the effect ro&s;e from the <HI>oppo&s;ition,</HI> and <HI>graduation</HI> of the&s;e extremes. It was &s;till increa&s;ed by the pillars, and other mem|bers of architecture, which beautifully varied, and broke both the light and the &s;hade; and gave a wonderful richne&s;s to each. The
<PB N="145" REF="174">whole, he &s;aid, &s;eemed like an effort of nature to &s;et off art; and the eye roved about in a&s;toni&s;hment to &s;ee a mere ma&s;s of regularity become the ground of &s;o inchanting a di&s;play of harmony, and picture&s;que effect. The elliptical form of the building was the magical &s;ource of this exhibition.</P>
<P>As objects of curio&s;ity, the parades, the baths, the rooms, and the abbey, are all worth feeing. The ri&s;ing grounds about Bath, as they appear from the town, are a great ornament to <HI>it:</HI> tho they have nothing plea|&s;ing in <HI>them&s;elves.</HI> There is no variety in the out-line; no breaks; no ma&s;&s;es of woody &s;cenery.</P>
<P>From Bath to Chippenham the road is plea|&s;ant; but I know not, that it de&s;erves any higher epithet.</P>
<P>From Chippenham to Marlborough, we pa&s;&s;ed over a wild plain, which conveys no idea, but that of va&s;tne&s;s, unadorned with beauty.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="175">Nature, in &s;cenes like the&s;e, &s;eems only to have chalked out her de&s;igns. The ground is laid in; but left unfini&s;hed. The orna|mental part is wanting&mdash;the river, or the lake winding through the bottom, which lies in form to receive it&mdash;the hanging rocks, to adorn &s;ome &s;hooting promontory&mdash;and the woody &s;creens to incompa&s;s, and give richne&s;s to the whole.</P>
<P>Marlborough-down is one of tho&s;e va&s;t, dreary &s;cenes, which our ance&s;tors, in the dignity of a &s;tate of nature, cho&s;e as a repo&s;itory of their dead. Every where we fee the tumuli, which were rai&s;ed over their a&s;hes; among which the large&s;t is Silbury-hill. The&s;e &s;tructures have no date in the hi&s;tory of time; and will be, in all probability, among it's mo&s;t la&s;ting monuments. Our ance&s;tors had no ingenious arts to gratify their ambition; and as they could not aim at immortality by a bu&s;t, a &s;tatue, or a piece of bas-relief, they endeavoured to obtain it by works of enormous labour. It was thus in other bar|barous countries. Before the introduction of
<PB N="147" REF="176">arts in Egypt, kings endeavoured to immor|talize them&s;elves by lying under pyramids.</P>
<P>As we pa&s;&s;ed, what are called, the ruins of Abury, we could not but admire the in|du&s;try, and &s;agacity of tho&s;e antiquarians, who can trace a regular plan in &s;uch a ma&s;s of con|fu&s;ion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See an acccount of Abury by Dr. Stukely.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>At the great inn at Marlborough, formerly a man&s;ion of the Somer&s;et-family, one of the&s;e tumuli &s;tands in the garden, and is whim&s;ically cut into a &s;piral walk; which, a&s;cending imperceptibly, is lengthened into half a mile. The conceit at lea&s;t gives an idea of the bulk of the&s;e ma&s;&s;y fabrics.</P>
<P>From Marlborough the road takes a more agreeable appearance. Savernake-fore&s;t, through which it pa&s;&s;es, is a plea&s;ant, woody &s;cene: and great part of the way afterwards is adorned with little groves, and opening glades, which form a variety of &s;econd di&s;tances on the right.
<PB N="148" REF="177">But we &s;eldom found a foreground to &s;et them off to advantage.</P>
<P>The country &s;oon degenerates into open corn-lands: but near Hungerford, which is not an unplea&s;ant town, it recovers a little &s;pirit; and the road pa&s;&s;es through clo&s;e lanes; with breaks here and there, into the country between the boles of the trees.</P>
<P>As we approach Newberry, we had a view of Donnington-ca&s;tle; one of tho&s;e &s;cenes, where the unfortunate Charles reaped &s;ome glory. Nothing now remains of this gallant fortre&s;s, but a gate-way and two towers. The hill, on which it &s;tands, is &s;o overgrown with bru&s;h-wood, that we could &s;carce di&s;cern any ve&s;tiges either of the walls of the ca&s;tle; or of the works, which had been thrown up again&s;t it.</P>
<P>This whole woody hill, and the ruins upon it, are now tenanted, as we were informed by our guide, only by gho&s;ts; which however add much to the dignity of the&s;e for&s;aken
<PB N="149" REF="178">habitations; and are for that rea&s;on, of great u&s;e in de&s;cription.</P>
<P>In Virgil's days, when the Tarpeian rock was graced by the grandeur of the capitol, it was &s;ufficiently enobled. But in it's early &s;tate, when it was <HI>&s;ylve&s;tribus horrida dumis,</HI> it wanted &s;omething to give it &s;plendor. The poet therefore has judiciou&s;ly added a few ideas of the awful kind; and has contrived by this machinery to impre&s;s it with more dignity in it's rude &s;tate, than it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in it's adorned one:
<Q><L>Jam turn religio pavidos terrebat agre&s;tes</L>
<L>Dira loci: jam tum &s;ylvam, &s;axumque timebant.</L>
<L>"Hoc nemus, hunc, inquit, frondo&s;o vertice collem,</L>
<L>(Quis Deus, iucertum e&s;t) habitat Deus, Arcades ip&s;um</L>
<L>Credunt &s;e vidi&s;&s;e Jovem, cum &s;aepe nigrantem</L>
<L>AEgida concuteret dextracirc, nimbo&s;que cieret."</L></Q></P>
<P>Of the&s;e imaginary beings the painter, in the mean time, makes little u&s;e. The intro|duction, of them, in&s;tead of rai&s;ing, would depreciate his &s;ubject. The characters indeed of Jupiter, Juno, and all that progeny, are rendered as familiar to us, through the antique, as tho&s;e of Alexander, and Cae&s;ar. But the judicious arti&s;t will be cautious how he goes
<PB N="150" REF="179">farther. The <HI>poet</HI> will introduce a phantom of any kind without &s;cruple. He knows his advantage. He &s;peaks to the <HI>imagination;</HI> and if he deal only in <HI>general ideas,</HI> as all good poets on &s;uch &s;ubjects will do, every reader will form the phantom according to his <HI>own</HI> conception. But <HI>the painter,</HI> who &s;peaks to the <HI>eye,</HI> has a more difficult work. He cannot deal in <HI>general</HI> terms: he is <HI>obliged to particularize:</HI> and it is not likely, that the &s;pectator will have the &s;ame idea of a phantom, which he has.&mdash;The painter therefore acts prudently in ab&s;taining, as much as po&s;&s;ible, from the repre&s;entation of fictitious beings.</P>
<P>The country about Newberry furni&s;hed little amu&s;ement. But if it is not <HI>picture&s;que,</HI> it is very <HI>hi&s;torical.</HI></P>
<P>In every <HI>hi&s;torical country</HI> there are a &s;et of ideas, which peculiarly belong to it. <HI>Ha&s;tings,</HI> and <HI>Tewk&s;bury; Runnemede,</HI> and <HI>Clarendon,</HI> have all their a&s;&s;ociate ideas. The ruins of abbeys, and ca&s;tles have another &s;et: and it is a &s;ooth|ing amu&s;ement in travelling to <HI>a&s;&s;imilate</HI> the mind to the <HI>ideas of the country.</HI> The ground
<PB N="151" REF="180">we now trod, has many hi&s;torical ideas a&s;|&s;ociated with it; two great battles, a long &s;iege, and the death of the gallant Lord Falk|land.</P>
<P>The road from Newberry to Reading leads through lanes, from which a flat and woody country is exhibited on the right; and ri&s;ing grounds on the left. Some unplea&s;ant com|mon fields intervene.</P>
<P>In the new road from Reading to Henly, the high grounds overlook a very picture&s;que di&s;tance on the right. The country indeed is flat; but this is a circum&s;tance we do not di&s;like in a di&s;tance, when it contains a variety of wood and plain; and when the parts are large, and well-combined.</P>
<P>Henley lies plea&s;antly among woody hills: but the chalk, bur&s;ting every where from the &s;oil, &s;trikes the eye in &s;pots; and injures the land&s;cape.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="181">From hence we &s;truck again into the road acro&s;s Houn&s;low-heath; having crouded much more within the &s;pace of a fortnight (to which our time was limited) than we ought to have done.</P>
