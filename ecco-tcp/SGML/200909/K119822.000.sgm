<HEAD>REMARKS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE circum&s;tances of tho&s;e antient times are &s;o totally different, in many re&s;pects, from the pre&s;ent times, that it is difficult to determine whether any &s;uch <HI>joint</HI> elections of knights, citizens,
<PB N="15" REF="13">and burge&s;&s;es, (by the united equal &s;uf|frages of all the electors together, of e|very degree, in each county,) can now be made; and, of cour&s;e, it is doubtful whether &s;uch a mea&s;ure is even advi&s;e|able. Many laws have &s;ince been en|acted re&s;pecting elections, all of which mu&s;t fir&s;t be well weighed and con&s;i|dered; for, if any thing therein is in|compatible with the nece&s;&s;ary alterati|ons, it mu&s;t be repealed by the &s;ame authority which ordained it; becau&s;e <Q><HI>non e&s;t recedendum a forma per &s;tatu|tum pre&s;cripta;</HI></Q> and, again, <Q><HI>nil temere novandum e&s;t.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Yet, as the inju&s;tice and fatal con&s;e|quences of the pre&s;ent enormous <HI>ine|quality of repre&s;entation</HI> in favour of pet|ty venal boroughs (to the di&s;advantage of the counties and great cities) is noto|rious and undeniable, &s;ome prudent re|medy is &s;urely become nece&s;&s;ary, and ought to be mo&s;t earne&s;tly &s;ought after
<PB N="16" REF="14">by all lovers of peace and good govern|ment.</P>
<P>The ruinous effects of a long conti|nued <HI>parliamentary corruption,</HI> and of its baneful companion, <HI>national repro|bacy,</HI> (which is the &s;ure harbinger of <HI>pub|lic misfortune</HI> and <HI>approaching &s;lavery,</HI>) have made &s;uch ha&s;ty advances of late, that many people begin to be alarmed, and to talk &s;eriou&s;ly concerning the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of endeavouring to obtain. <Q><HI>a more equal repre&s;entation of the com|mons in annual parliaments,</HI> as the true legal means of re&s;toring public credit, and of &s;aving the &s;tate.</Q> Such a di&s;po&s;ition, towards parliamentary re|formation, I have perceived in &s;everal places, among&s;t people who have not the lea&s;t connexion with each other, &s;o that it &s;eems to be the mo&s;t natural and ob|vious conclu&s;ion of common &s;en&s;e upon the pre&s;ent alarming &s;tate of public af|fairs; and will, probably, (if matters
<PB N="17" REF="15">&s;hould grow wor&s;e,) become more and more general, till the mea&s;ure be irre|&s;i&s;tibly demanded by the voice of the people; in which ca&s;e, all tho&s;e per&s;ons, who have been mo&s;t concerned in the management of the public trea&s;ury, mu&s;t expect to undergo a &s;evere &s;crutiny! Or, if any &s;udden inva&s;ion of our natu|ral enemies &s;hould be really intended, (which there is but too much rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect,) the people, it is to be feared, as &s;oon as they are informed of the pub|lic danger, will be &s;o tran&s;ported with &s;udden indignation again&s;t particular per|&s;ons, who&s;e mea&s;ures may &s;eem to have contributed to the national weakne&s;s, that they will not ea&s;ily be re&s;trained from violent and incon&s;iderate acts of per&s;onal re&s;entment! And it is not at all probable that the people will be tho|roughly or &s;ufficiently united to act a|gain&s;t the common enemy, until they have taken &s;uch &s;teps as they may think
<PB N="18" REF="16">effectual to in&s;ure a reformation of go|vernment, (in ca&s;e their endeavours a|gain&s;t the common enemy &s;hould prove &s;ucce&s;sful,) and to prevent the like cala|mities in future.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e &s;tate-mini&s;ters, therefore, who &s;hall have &s;ufficient courage to give up, in time, all reliance on <HI>undue parlia|mentary influence,</HI> and &s;hall prove that their regard for good and <HI>legal govern|ment</HI> is &s;incere, by promoting &s;ome le|gal means of re&s;toring to the electors of <HI>counties</HI> and <HI>great cities</HI> their due pro|portion of <HI>repre&s;entation</HI> and <HI>con&s;equence in the great national a&s;&s;embly,</HI> tho&s;e mi|ni&s;ters, I &s;ay, how&s;oever their former mea&s;ures may have been di&s;liked, will, by &s;uch a proof of their <HI>&s;incerity</HI> in re|formation, <HI>in&s;ure to them&s;elves</HI> the pub|lic e&s;teem and confidence: for there is a general di&s;po&s;ition in Engli&s;hmen to overlook all differences of opinion in po|litics, and to forget all party animo&s;ities

<PB N="42" REF="39"><HI>For the maintenance of the &s;aid articles, and &s;tatutes, and redre&s;s of divers mi&s;|chiefs and grievances, which daily hap|pen,</HI> A PARLIAMENT SHALL BE HOL|DEN EVERY YEAR, as another time was ordained by a &s;tatute.</Q> Which Statute, here referred to, was made in the 4th year of the &s;ame reign, cap. 14. <Q>Item, it is accorded, that a Parliament &s;hall be holden EVERY YEAR ONCE, <HI>and more often if need be.</HI></Q> But Sir William Black&s;tone &s;uppo&s;es that the King never was <Q>obliged, by the&s;e Statutes, to call a <HI>new</HI> Parliament <HI>eve|ry year;</HI> but only to permit a Parlia|ment to &s;it annually for the redre&s;s of grievances, and di&s;patch of bu&s;ine&s;s, <HI>if need be.</HI></Q> (1 Com. c. 2, p. 153.)</P>
<P>It is too true, indeed, that our Kings, in general, did not think them&s;elves "<HI>obliged,</HI> by the&s;e Statutes," (as they ought in con&s;cience to have been, for the &s;afety of their &s;ouls,) <Q>to call a <HI>new
<PB N="43" REF="40">Parliament every year:</HI></Q> nay, it is certain that many of them would never have called a Parliament at all, had they not been <HI>"obliged"</HI> by nece&s;&s;ity and the circum&s;tances of the times. But by what authority could a repre&s;entative in one Parliament take his &s;eat in the <HI>next an|nual Parliament,</HI> without <HI>re-election,</HI> before any laws were made for lengthen|ing the duration of Parliaments? And be&s;ides, if the King did <Q><HI>only permit</HI> a Parliament to &s;it annually,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by what authority could the Parliament be convened at all, under &s;uch a circum|&s;tance, &s;eeing that a <HI>mere permi&s;&s;ion to &s;it</HI> excludes the idea of a prorogation from year to year? However, the learned commentator him&s;elf very ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, in a preceding page, (150,) concerning "the manner and time of a&s;&s;embling," that the <Q>Parliament is regularly to be &s;ummoned by the King's <HI>Writ,</HI> or Letter, i&s;&s;ued out of Chancery.</Q> And
<PB N="44" REF="41">it is well known that the&s;e Writs are not addre&s;&s;ed to the knights, citizens, and burge&s;&s;es, elected for any <HI>former</HI> Parlia|ment, but to <HI>the Sheriffs alone,</HI> to cau&s;e <HI>Knights, Citizens, &amp;c. to be elected;</HI> for, when the &s;aid Acts were made, &s;uch an ab&s;urdity in politics had never been con|ceived in England, as that of tru&s;ting the <HI>Repre&s;entation</HI> of the people, for <HI>a term of years,</HI> (as at pre&s;ent,) to the per&s;ons elected! On the contrary, when the bu&s;ine&s;s of each Se&s;&s;ion was fini&s;hed, the Parliament, of cour&s;e, was at an end; and therefore Lord Coke did not &s;peak in vain, when he mentioned <HI>"the excellent Law"</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI> the Act for <HI>annual</HI> Parliaments) <Q><HI>being applied to the &s;aid Writs of Parliament,</HI></Q> &amp;c. before recited.</P>
<P>A man of &s;o much good &s;en&s;e, learn|ing, and judgement, as Sir William Black&s;tone is ma&s;ter of, mu&s;t be well a|ware of the pernicious effects of inve&s;ting
<PB N="45" REF="42">the Repre&s;entatives of the people with a legi&s;lative power, beyond the con&s;tituti|onal term of A SINGLE SESSION, without <HI>Re-election;</HI> and therefore I cannot but be &s;urprized at the unguarded manner in which he has expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in his Comment on the two <HI>excellent Statutes</HI> of Edward III. for <HI>annual</HI> Parliaments; <HI>viz.</HI> that the King is not, <Q>or ever was, o|bliged by the&s;e Statutes to call <HI>a new</HI> Parliament every year,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He has cau&s;ed the word <HI>new</HI> to be printed in <HI>Ita|lics,</HI> as if he meant thereby to in&s;inuate, that the Legi&s;latures of tho&s;e early times were not unacquainted with our modern idea of conferring on the popular Repre|&s;entation a kind of <HI>continued &s;enatorial dignity,</HI> without <HI>Re-election,</HI> for &s;everal years together; whereas he certainly mu&s;t have known that this corrupt <HI>modern</HI> practice has produced a <HI>new order</HI> of men among&s;t us, a mo&s;t dangerous increa&s;e of ari&s;tocratical power, which was entirely
<PB N="46" REF="43">unknown to our Ance&s;tors in the glorious reign of Edward III. If he could &s;hew that there <HI>ever</HI> was a Parliament, in tho&s;e times, that was <HI>not a</HI> NEW <HI>Parlia|ment,</HI> his Comment might be ju&s;tified! But it is notorious that Writs were i&s;&s;ued to the Sheriffs, for <HI>new</HI> Elections, almo&s;t <HI>every year</HI> during that whole reign: The Writs, for the mo&s;t part, are &s;till pre&s;er|ved with the Returns upon them. In the catalogue of Election-Writs, which Prynne has given in his <HI>Brevia Parlia|mentaria Rediviva,</HI> p. 4 to 6, there is an account of Writs i&s;&s;ued for <HI>new</HI> Elections in every year of that King's reign, be|tween his 34th (when the la&s;t Act for annual Parliaments was made) and his 50th year, except 3, <HI>viz.</HI> the 40th, 41&s;t, and 48th, years; in which years the Records of Summons to the Prelates and Lords of Parliament are al&s;o wanting, as appears by Sir William Dugdale's <Q>per|fect
<PB N="47" REF="44">Copy of Summons to Parliament of the Nobility,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And yet this affords no ab&s;olute proof that Parliaments were not holden <HI>in tho&s;e very years</HI> for which the Writs are want|ing; becau&s;e the bundles of Writs for the &s;aid years may have been lo&s;t or mi&s;laid. The only wonder is, that more have not been lo&s;t, when we con&s;ider the very little care that had been taken of them; for Prynne found many of the&s;e Writs di&s;per&s;ed among a va&s;t mi&s;cellane|ous heap of other records on various &s;ub|jects, (as he him&s;elf relates in his Epi&s;tle-Dedicatory to King Charles II. of his <HI>Brevia Parliamentaria Rediviva,)</HI> cal|ling the &s;aid heap a <Q><HI>confu&s;ed Chaos,</HI> under corrding putrifying cobwebs, du&s;t, and filth, in the darke&s;t corner of Cae&s;ar's Chapel in the White Tow|er, as <HI>mere u&s;ele&s;s Reliques not worthy to be calendred,</HI></Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And, in page 103 of that &s;ame work, he &s;peaks of 117
<PB N="48" REF="45">Bundles of Writs, whereof 97 had only been then <HI>lately</HI> di&s;covered, filed, and bundled, by him&s;elf: <Q>But many of the&s;e 117 Bundles</Q> (&s;ays he) <Q>are <HI>not compleat,</HI> above half or three parts of the Writs being either rotted, con|&s;umed, maymed, torn, or <HI>utterly lo&s;t,</HI> through carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, wet, cankers, or other ca&s;ualties; and &s;ome of them have not above two, three, or four Writs, and one or two but one Writ and Retorn remaining.</Q></P>
<P>But that there were really Writs for Parliaments, even in tho&s;e <HI>three</HI> years, which appear to be wanting, at lea&s;t in <HI>two</HI> of them, is very certain; becau&s;e it was in the 40th year of this reign, as Sir Edward Coke informs us, (4 In&s;t. p. 13,) that the Pope demanded homage for the kingdoms of England and Ireland, and the arrears of revenue granted by King John to Pope Innocent III. <Q>whereupon the King, in the <HI>&s;ame
<PB N="49" REF="46">year, calleth his Court of Parliament,</HI></Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In this Parliament it was unanimou&s;ly agreed, by the Prelates, Dukes, Counts, Barons, and <HI>Commons,</HI> ("et <HI>la Commun,</HI>" and again, <HI>"et Communes,"</HI>) <Q>that the &s;aid King John, nor no other, could put him&s;elf, nor his Realm, nor his People, in &s;uch Subjection, without their <HI>A&s;&s;ent</HI> ('&s;ans a&s;&s;ent de eux'); and, if it was done, it was done without their A&s;&s;ent,</Q> (that is, without the A&s;&s;ent of the <HI>Common;</HI> for the A&s;&s;ent of the Barons was expre&s;&s;ed in the Charter,) <Q>and con|trary to his Oath at his Coronation,</Q> p. 14. Where|upon Lord Coke remarks, in the margin, that <Q>no King can put him&s;elf, nor his Realm, nor his Peo|ple, in &s;uch Subjection, without A&s;&s;ent of the <HI>Lords and Commons in Parliament,</HI></Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> &amp;c. as Sir Edward Coke proves from the Parliament-Rolls of that year, N^o 8, remarking, at the &s;ame time, that the Act then made was "never yet printed." See the margin, 4th In&s;t. p. 13.</P>
<P>And it appears that a Parliament was held al&s;o in the 48th year of this reign, becau&s;e &s;upplies were in that year granted to the King by Parliament, as related by Sir Richard Baker, in his Chronicle, p. 173, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q><HI>in his eight and fortieth year,</HI> IN A PARLIAMENT, is granted
<PB N="50" REF="47">him a 10th of the Clergy, and a 15th of the Laity.</Q> So that there is but <HI>one</HI> year, out of &s;o many, in which we cannot trace the meeting of the annual Parliaments: And <HI>annual</HI> Writs for <HI>new</HI> Elections were regularly i&s;&s;ued for the fir&s;t 18 years of the following reign, (as appears by Prynne's <Q>2d part of a brief Regi&s;ter and Survey of the &s;everal kinds and forms of parliamentary Writs,</Q> pages 116 and 117,) till Rich|ard II. (that wretched perjured monarch) had rendered him&s;elf <HI>ab&s;olute.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His arbitrary proceedings very &s;oon afterwards oc|ca&s;ioned his own Lo&s;s of Power, and total Fjectment from the Throne; &s;o that, notwith&s;tanding his boa&s;ted <HI>Firmne&s;s</HI> in executing his favourite mea&s;ures, he was at la&s;t reduced to the mo&s;t abject acknowledgements of his own unworthine&s;s to reign.</NOTE></P>
<P>After con&s;idering the&s;e unque&s;tionable evidences of the i&s;&s;uing Writs <HI>annualy</HI> for <HI>new</HI> Elections, it will be difficult to comprehend the meaning of Sir William Black&s;tone's Comment on the &s;aid two
<PB N="51" REF="48">Acts for <HI>annual</HI> Parliaments: <Q>Not that he (the King) is, or ever was, obliged by the&s;e Statutes to call a <HI>new</HI> Parlia|ment every year; but only to permit a Parliament to &s;it annually for the re|dre&s;s of grievances and di&s;patch of bu|&s;ine&s;s, <HI>if need be.</HI> &mdash; The&s;e la&s;t words</Q> (&s;ays he) <Q>are &s;o <HI>loo&s;e and vague,</HI> that &s;uch of our monarchs, as were incli|ned to govern without Parliaments, neglected the convoking them, &s;ome|times for a con&s;iderable period, under pretence that there <HI>was no need of them,</HI></Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But <HI>"the&s;e la&s;t words"</HI> are not <Q><HI>&s;o loo&s;e and vague</HI></Q> as either to ju&s;tify his own explanation of the &s;aid Statues, (<HI>viz.</HI> not <Q>to call a <HI>new</HI> Parliament every year, but only to <HI>permit</HI> a Parliament to &s;it,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) or to excu&s;e, in the lea&s;t degree, the criminal neglects of tho&s;e de|praved monarchs who were inclined to govern without them: for the words,
<PB N="52" REF="49"><HI>"if need be,"</HI> cannot, according to the mo&s;t obvious &s;en&s;e of the Act wherein they are found, be applied to the main purpo&s;e of the Act, (the holding <HI>annual Parliaments,</HI>) but merely to the remain|ing part of the &s;entence, <HI>viz.</HI><Q><HI>and more often:</HI></Q> that is, <Q>and more often, if need be.</Q> The Order, <Q><HI>that a Par|liament &s;hall be holden</HI> EVERY YEAR ONCE,</Q> is ab&s;olute; and the di&s;cretio|nary power, expre&s;&s;ed in the words <Q><HI>if need be,</HI></Q> relates apparently to the cal|ling Parliaments <HI>"more often:"</HI> for, if the &s;aid di&s;cretionary words, <HI>"if need be,"</HI> could, with any propriety, be applied to the whole &s;entence, the Act it&s;elf would have been nugatory; which could never be the <HI>intention</HI> of the Legi&s;lature: but the true meaning and &s;en&s;e of the Legi&s;la|ture is very clearly proved by the hi&s;tories of tho&s;e times: for it is manife&s;t, not only that <HI>new</HI> Repre&s;entatives were elected <HI>e|very year</HI> (with only one exception) for a
<PB N="53" REF="50">con&s;iderable number of years after the la&s;t of the &s;aid Acts was made, (which confirms the main purpo&s;e of the Acts, <HI>viz.</HI> the holding <HI>annual Parliaments,</HI>) but it is al&s;o manife&s;t, that Parliaments were frequently holden <HI>"more often"</HI> than once a year; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Writs were i&s;&s;ued for electing 3 <HI>new</HI> Parliaments in the 6th year of Edw. III. 2 in his 11th year, 3 in his 12th year, and even 4 in his 14th year; and there appear to have been 2 <HI>new</HI> Parliaments in the 7th of Rich. II. See <HI>Prynne's Brevia Parliamentaria Rediviva,</HI> p. 5 &amp; 6.</NOTE> which amply confirms al|&s;o what I have before &s;aid, concerning the meaning of the di&s;cretionary power, expre&s;&s;ed in the &s;aid Act, by the words <HI>"if need be."</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e very frequent Elections (&s;ome|times two, three, and four, times IN ONE YEAR) &s;ufficiently prove that the power, delegated by the people to their Repre&s;entatives, continued no longer in force than during the Se&s;&s;ion of the par|ticular Parliament to which they were
<PB N="54" REF="51">&s;ummoned; which being <Q><HI>once determi|ned,</HI></Q> (&s;ays Prynne, i&s;t part of Brief Regi&s;ter, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of Parl.

And therefore Judge Black&s;tone's in&s;i|nuation, again&s;t the calling of a <HI>new</HI> Par|liament, has no real foundation: for, if it was the intention of the Legi&s;lature, in the two Acts abovementioned, that the King &s;hould ever &s;ummon <HI>any Parlia|ment at all,</HI> they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be un|der&s;tood to mean a <HI>new</HI> Parliament on all occa&s;ions; <HI>i. e.</HI> not only that the regu|lar Parliaments, which they ordained <Q><HI>to be</HI> holden every <HI>year once,</HI></Q> &s;hould be <HI>new</HI> Parliaments, but al&s;o tho&s;e that
<PB N="55" REF="52">&s;hould be &s;ummoned upon any extraordi|nary unfore&s;een occa&s;ions; which is &s;uf|ficiently expre&s;&s;ed in the 1&s;t of the &s;aid Acts, by the words, <Q><HI>and more often, if need be.</HI></Q> The meaning of the Act is <HI>unque&s;tionably</HI> proved by the actual i&s;&s;uing of writs, to the Sheriffs, for electing Knights, Citizens, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for <HI>two, three,</HI> and &s;ometimes <HI>four, new</HI> Parliaments, <HI>in one year,</HI> as mentioned above: And if any per&s;on &s;hould object, that &s;uch <HI>very fre|quent Elections</HI> mu&s;t be attended with in|&s;uperable difficulties and inconveniences, we may quote the experience of all an|cient times, as affording ample and &s;uffi|cient proofs to the contrary; <Q>there be|ing not above two or three ca&s;es of e|lections que&s;tioned, or complained of, from 49 Hen.
