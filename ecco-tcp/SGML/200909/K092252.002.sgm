<HEAD>BOOK THE FOURTH.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER I. The Author appeals to his Readers.</HEAD>
<P>I SHALL now put in a few words, whil&s;t my hi&s;tory pau&s;es, touching what I claim from my readers, as a right, and what I hope and expect from them, as a favour.</P>
<P>My claim is briefly this, credit in all ca&s;es for an hone&s;t meaning, or in other words, the be&s;t &s;en&s;e that a doubtful pa&s;&s;age will bear: it is thus I have treated others, the &s;ame treat|ment I have a right now to claim from them.</P>
<P>On the &s;core of favour I am their &s;uitor in the humble&s;t &s;en&s;e, for I &s;ee &s;o many imper|fections &s;tarting up in my performance, which I cannot cure, and &s;u&s;pect there may be &s;o many more, which po&s;&s;ibly I &s;hall not di&s;cover, that I have no notion of &s;ending my &s;ins into the world without one apology; I am not hardy enough to give in the account between my readers and my&s;elf, without the u&s;ual &s;alvo of <HI>er|rors</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="5">
<HI>excepted.</HI>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Take Nature for your guide,"</Q> &s;ays the critic; <Q REND="inline">"follow her and you can't go wrong."</Q> True, mo&s;t &s;agacious critic, I reply; but what is &s;o difficult? Does the tragic poet always find her out? Does the comic writer never mi&s;s her haunts? Yet they profe&s;s to paint from nature, and no doubt they do their be&s;t: the outline may be true, but the lea&s;t &s;lip in filling it up mars the por|trait; it demands a &s;teady hand, a faithful eye, a watchful judgment, to make the like|ne&s;s perfect; and grant it perfect, the author's work will gain no prai&s;e, unle&s;s it be plea&s;ing al&s;o; for who opens a novel but in the ex|pectation of being amu&s;ed by it?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Let it be merry,"</Q> &s;ays one, <Q REND="inline">"for I love to laugh."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Let it be pathetic,"</Q> &s;ays a &s;econd, <Q REND="inline">"for I have no objection to the melancholy tale that makes me weep;"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Let your characters be &s;trongly marked,"</Q> cries a third, <Q REND="inline">"your fable well imagined, and work it up with a variety of new and &s;triking incidents, for I like to have my attention kept alive."</Q>&mdash;The&s;e and a hundred more are the demands, which one poor brain is to &s;atisfy in a work of fancy; wit, humour, cha|racter, invention, genius, are to be &s;et to work together, fiction is to be combined with pro|bability,
<PB N="3" REF="6">
novelty with nature, ridicule with good-humour, pa&s;&s;ion with morality, and pain with plea&s;ure; every thing is to be natural, yet nothing common; animating, but not in|flammatory; intere&s;ting, but not incredible; in &s;hort, there mu&s;t be every thing that judg|ment can plan and genius execute, to make the compo&s;ition perfect: no man has done all this, and he, who has done mo&s;t towards it, has &s;till fallen very &s;hort of the whole.</P>
<P>With all this con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s about me, I yet do not de&s;pair but that the candid reader will find &s;omething in this fable to overbalance its mi&s;carriages. I &s;hall proceed as one, who knows his danger, but is not di&s;couraged from his duty. The&s;e children of my fancy, whom I have brought into exi&s;tence, I &s;hall treat as they de&s;erve, dealing out their portions of ho|nour and di&s;honour as their conduct &s;eems to call for it; and though &s;ome among&s;t them will probably per&s;i&s;t in acting an evil part to the la&s;t, yet collectively they will leave no evil le&s;&s;on behind them.</P>
<P>As to our hero, if he has been &s;o fortunate as to gain an intere&s;t in the good opinion of the reader in this period of his hi&s;tory, I am bold to hope he will not forfeit it in the &s;uc|ceeding
<PB N="4" REF="7">
occurrences of his life, but that he &s;hall pre&s;erve a con&s;i&s;tent character to the end; that &s;o, when his part is fini&s;hed, be it happy or unhappy, he may earn a plaudit as the cur|tain drops.</P>
<P>I do not aim to draw a perfect character, for after a pretty long acquaintance with man|kind I have never met with any one example of the &s;ort: how then &s;hall I de&s;cribe what I have not &s;een? On the contrary, if I wi&s;h to form a character, like this of Henry, in which virtue predominates, or like that of Blachford, where the oppo&s;ite qualities prevail, I have nature before me in both ca&s;es: but if in the former in&s;tance I will not &s;uffer a &s;ingle &s;hade to fall upon my canvas, and in the latter do not let one tint of light appear, what do I pre&s;ent to the &s;pectator, but a confu&s;ed and &s;hapele&s;s ma&s;s, here too glaring, and there too opaque, to pre&s;erve any outline that can give to view the form and fa&s;hion of a man?&mdash;The brighte&s;t &s;ide of human nature is not without a &s;pot, the darke&s;t &s;ide is not without a &s;park.</P>
<P>For my own part, as I am not apt to be amu&s;ed with &s;tories told to the di&s;credit of mankind, I &s;hould be &s;orry if this of mine ap|peared to any of my readers to have that
<PB N="5" REF="8">
tendency in the general. A contra&s;t of cha|racter there will be in all hi&s;tories, true or feigned; but when an author is the biographer of men and women of his own making, he has it in his power, without lo&s;ing &s;ight of na|ture, to let the prevailing impre&s;&s;ion of his fable be favourable or unfavourable, and in|dulge his own propen&s;ities to a certain degree, which ever way they point. Now I know not why we &s;hould &s;tudiou&s;ly put forward none but the wor&s;t features of the time we live in; yet I think this has been done by &s;ome no|veli&s;ts of great celebrity, in whom there reigns a &s;pirit of &s;atire, that in my opinion neither adds to their merit nor our amu&s;ement. A pedant, who &s;ecludes him&s;elf from &s;ociety, may nouri&s;h a cynical humour; but a writer, who gives the living manners of the age, is &s;uppo&s;ed to live among&s;t men, and write from the crowd rather than the clo&s;et; now if &s;uch a man runs about from place to place with no cleanlier purpo&s;e than to &s;earch for filth and ordure, I conceive his office to be that of a &s;cavenger rather than a &s;cholar. An hone&s;t man, as I take it, will always find hone&s;ty enough, and a friendly man meet friend&s;hip enough in his contemporaries, to keep him in
<PB N="6" REF="9">
good-humour with them. Something indeed may be found to reprehend in all times; as the manners and the morals fluctuate, the mirror that reflects them faithfully will give to objects as they pa&s;s their proper form and feature. In the time I am now writing, the national character &s;hews it&s;elf in &s;o bright a point of view, that the author mu&s;t be har&s;h in the ex|treme, who holds up fictions of depravity as exemplars of the aera in which he lives.</P>
<P>I think I may promi&s;e my&s;elf, therefore, that the general &s;pirit of my hi&s;tory will not be thought moro&s;e. I have, indeed, taken occa|&s;ion, in the character of Jemima Cawdle, to make free with enthu&s;ia&s;m; but I have at the &s;ame time exhibited it in contact with a virtu|ous principle, under the au&s;pices of my wor|thy friend Ezekiel Daw: I have de&s;cribed a dome&s;tic tyrant in the per&s;on of Lord Crow|bery; but I did not give him a title becau&s;e I thought that pride was attached to a peerage, or that the cruel and overbearing part which my fable a&s;&s;igns to him, was characteri&s;tic of nobility, the very contrary of which I hold for doctrine; neither did I locate Blachford in Jamaica, as favouring an invective again&s;t our countrymen in the We&s;t Indies; no man, I
<PB N="7" REF="10">
believe, can be found le&s;s inclined to be a con|vert to that groundle&s;s prejudice, which vain and &s;hallow heads have been hatching for pur|po&s;es no le&s;s fatal to the intere&s;ts of the public than to the reputations of individuals.</P>
<P>To repre&s;ent &s;cenes of familiar life in an elegant and intere&s;ting manner, is one of the mo&s;t difficult ta&s;ks an author can take in hand; for of the&s;e every man is a critic: Nature is in the fir&s;t place to be attended to, and probabi|lity is not to be lo&s;t &s;ight of; but it mu&s;t be nature &s;trongly featured, and probability clo&s;ely bordering on the marvellous; the one mu&s;t touch upon extravagance, and the other be highly &s;ea&s;oned with adventures&mdash;for who will thank us for a dull and lifele&s;s journal of in|&s;ipid facts? Now every peculiarity of humour in the human character is a &s;train upon nature, and every &s;urprizing incident is a degree of violence to probability: How far &s;hall we go then for our reader's amu&s;ement, how &s;oon &s;hall we &s;top in con&s;ideration of our&s;elves? There is undoubtedly a land-mark in the fields of fancy, <HI>&s;unt certi denique fines,</HI> but it re|quires a nice di&s;cernment to find them out, and a cautious temper not to &s;tep beyond them.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="11">Here, then, I will re&s;t my cau&s;e, and conclude my chapter. My readers have my be&s;t endeavours to amu&s;e them; I have de|voted very many hours to the compo&s;ition of the&s;e volumes, and I am beholden to them for beguiling me of many a care; if they retain their property when they &s;hall pa&s;s into the hands of tho&s;e who peru&s;e them, it will be every thing I can hope for from them.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II. Chamber Dialogues of different Sorts.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN our hero arrived at Zachary's ca&s;|tle, he found a po&s;t-chai&s;e in waiting at the gate: As he pa&s;&s;ed it to enter the court, he made a profound reverence to a lady, whom at fir&s;t &s;ight he &s;uppo&s;ed to be his noble benefac|tre&s;s and the owner of it. Upon the gla&s;s being let down, to return his civility, he per|ceived his mi&s;take: It was I&s;abella Man&s;tock: She had accompanied her cou&s;in in her morn|ing airing, and was now filling up the time with a book, whil&s;t her lady&s;hip was in private conference with Doctor Cawdle. That lady had imparted &s;o much of her bu&s;ine&s;s to Mi&s;s
<PB N="9" REF="12">
Man&s;tock as &s;ufficed to inform her &s;he was upon a very intere&s;ting di&s;covery as to the iden|tity of a young man who had belonged to her decea&s;ed friend Ratcliffe, and whom &s;he ex|pected to meet that morning at the Doctor's. Of Henry's adventure with the Miller, and what had pa&s;&s;ed in con&s;equence of it, that young lady was fully appri&s;ed; the &s;tory had been told to Sir Roger in her hearing over night, and more circum&s;tantially detailed by Lady Crowbery as &s;he came with her in the chai&s;e. When &s;he &s;aw, therefore, a young man in mourning, who&s;e appearance an&s;wered to the de&s;cription &s;he had had of him, &s;he was in no doubt of his being the per&s;on in que&s;tion: Curio&s;ity led her to &s;urvey him with &s;ome at|tention; and when &s;he perceived him, after &s;topping for &s;ome little time at the gate, turn back without entering it, (for the &s;ight of Lady Crowbery's equipage made him doubt of the propriety of his vi&s;it) &s;he took courage to acco&s;t him, &s;aying&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"If your name is Henry, Sir, I believe you are expected within doors."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"That is my name, Madam,"</Q> he replied very re&s;pectfully; <Q REND="inline">"and I am much beholden to you;"</Q> upon this he turned back, and entered through the &s;hop to the offices.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="13">In the kitchen he was encountered by old Bridget, who, after daring at him for &s;ome time with a&s;toni&s;hment, no &s;ooner recognized his per&s;on, thus newly habited, than &s;he began a &s;tring of que&s;tions, huddled together with &s;o little order, and &s;o much eagerne&s;s, that he fairly excu&s;ed him&s;elf the trouble of replying to any one of them, by de&s;iring &s;he would let her ma&s;ter know that he attended his plea&s;ure.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Hold there!"</Q> cried Bridget, <Q REND="inline">"ma&s;ter is engag'd."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I know how he is engag'd,"</Q> replied Henry, <Q REND="inline">"but I fancy he will &s;ee me."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Say you &s;o?"</Q> quoth the hag, <Q REND="inline">"then 'tis clear from what quarter your fortune comes: Ifackins! you're a rare one! Some folks have the luck of it, that's for certain: times are well chang'd with you, young&s;ter, &s;ince you fir&s;t enter'd the&s;e doors; no won|der you was in &s;uch ha&s;te to leave us; fine cloaths and an ea&s;y &s;ervice &s;uit you better than hard work and a coar&s;e jacket!"</Q>&mdash;She then ran on with more of the like tra&s;h, with &s;everal &s;ly glances at Lady Crowbery, till Henry again reminded her of going up to her ma&s;ter&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Well, well!"</Q> replied &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"have a little patience, my fine &s;park, and recollect it is not yet my place to go on
<PB N="11" REF="14">
your errands at the word of command: though my lady has thought fit to dre&s;s you out like a gentleman, &s;he has not hir'd me to be your me&s;&s;enger: However, I &s;hall tell my ma&s;ter you are here. Sit down upon that bench; time was when you would have thank'd me for the offer: when you are call'd for I'll let you know."</Q></P>
<P>Thus muttering to her&s;elf, &s;he mounted the &s;tairs; but in&s;tead of going into Zachary's room, went &s;trait to her mi&s;tre&s;s, eager to broach the news &s;he was charged with, and well prepared to &s;et it off with every proper comment and illu&s;tration, &s;uited to her own envious temper and the hearer's ta&s;te.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Here's news to tell the King!"</Q> cried the hag, as &s;he hobbled into Jemima's chamber: <Q REND="inline">"As &s;ure as you are in that place alive, Mi&s;tre&s;s, wou'd you think it? there's Harry, our errand-boy, now in the hou&s;e, &s;pruc'd out as fine as any lord in the land. If he was heir to the greate&s;t &s;quire in the coun|ty he cou'dn't be in hand&s;omer mourning; &s;pick and &s;pan new from top to toe, and all of the be&s;t!"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"What do you tell me?"</Q> exclaim'd Jemima, <Q REND="inline">"how has all this hap|pen'd?</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"How has it happen'd!"</Q> repeated
<PB N="12" REF="15">
Bridget; <Q REND="inline">"why, as it always happens to &s;uch vapouring Jacks, by a &s;mooth tongue and a hand&s;ome face; the poor and homely may go &s;tarve for &s;ome folks; young and per|&s;onable beggars pick up all the charity: mar|ry commend me to &s;uch charity, it may well be &s;aid to cover the multitude of &s;ins! As if it cou'd be a que&s;tion, how he came by his clothes, when there is a certain great lady clo&s;e clo&s;etted with ma&s;ter, who is waiting to &s;ee him in all his glory, and I warrant you upon thorns till I tell her he is come; but I won't tell her, not I, at lea&s;t till I have your orders for it I won't: for why? I am no &s;er|vant of her's, I'm no putter-together of peo|ple that don't pay me for it: why &s;hould I &s;kip of his errands? I wi&s;h to my heart, mi&s;|tre&s;s, you cou'd only &s;ee with your own eyes how the lad is chang'd &s;ince he &s;lipp'd his &s;kin: Then he carries him in &s;uch a way; he is as vain as a peacock: I prote&s;t to you I did not know him when he &s;tept into the kitchen: Sir, &s;aid I, with a curte&s;y, what is your plea&s;ure? for I thought he was &s;ome fine gentleman that might have cu&s;tom for my ma&s;ter.&mdash;Bridget! cries he, go up to your ma&s;ter, and tell him I am here.&mdash;Marry come up! my
<PB N="13" REF="16">
dirty companion, quoth I, (for his tongue betray'd him, and by this time I had &s;pied him out) who'll be the fool then? My ma&s;ter's employ'd with your betters. Let him be em|ploy'd with whom he will, quoth he, I &s;hall be welcome, &s;o tell him what I bid you. With that I thought of the old proverb, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Set a beggar on hor&s;eback,</HI>"</Q> and will'd him to re|flect on what he was before he pre&s;um'd to &s;end me on his me&s;&s;ages: Yet I was minded to tell you what was going on, &s;o I came ne|verthele&s;s; and now, if you plea&s;e, I will go back and let him know I'm not the per&s;on he takes me for, to fetch and carry at his com|mand; for my part, I am out of all patience with &s;uch up&s;tarts."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Hold, Bridget,"</Q> replied Jemima, <Q REND="inline">"up|on reflection I think it be&s;t you &s;hould let him come up; for 'tis clear to me from what point this wind blows; and though I don't ap|prove of my hou&s;e being made a hou&s;e of a&s;|&s;ignation, yet by indulging them in this one meeting we may get to the bottom of the plot, if we can but contrive to overhear their cabal. So this is your fine charitable Lady Crowbery, whom every body is prai&s;ing for her good works! rare works, o'my con&s;cience! excellent
<PB N="14" REF="17">
charity! that &s;ingles out the hand&s;ome&s;t young fellow in the world for its object, and then thinks to throw du&s;t in our eyes by pretending to befriend him out of pure pity and good will! Ah Bridget, Bridget! what a world is this we live in! How often have I preached to you upon the vanity of works! Let us have faith and grace, and it matters little what we do, or what we omit to do. For my part, I always &s;u&s;pect your charitable people; and as for her lady&s;hip here at hand, 'tis pretty clear what complexion her charity is of: how|ever, let her have her way for this turn, let her have-her &s;wing of charity, and enjoy the fruits of her good works; but be &s;ure to put your ear to the key-hole, and di&s;cover if you can what is going on, for all means are fair to bring to light the dark deeds of the wicked."</Q></P>
<P>Whil&s;t this was pa&s;&s;ing with Jemima and her maid, Lady Crowbery and the Doctor had been in clo&s;e and earne&s;t con&s;ultation on the &s;ub|ject of the di&s;covery now &s;o fully a&s;certained. When &s;he had given way to tho&s;e tender emotions, which Nature exacts from the &s;en&s;i|bility of a parent under circum&s;tances &s;o criti|cal, &s;he ro&s;e from her chair, and having taken two or three turns acro&s;s the room, as if for
<PB N="15" REF="18">
recollection's &s;ake and to compo&s;e her &s;pirits, re&s;umed her &s;eat, and laying her hand upon the Doctor's arm, as he re&s;ted it on the elbow of his chair: <Q REND="inline">"My good friend,"</Q> &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline">"what &s;hall I do in this perplexity? Dare I commit my&s;elf at once to the di&s;cretion of this young man, and tru&s;t him with the &s;ecret of his birth? Alas! I dare not make the di&s;co|very to him: the terror I &s;hould &s;uffer, left the &s;ecret &s;hould e&s;cape him and reach my lord, would be in&s;upportable; you know his temper too well not to &s;ee how compleatly ruined I &s;hould be in &s;uch an event: indeed I cannot even gue&s;s at the con&s;equences; only this I am a&s;&s;ured of, they would be mo&s;t dreadful."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Truly,"</Q> replied Zachary, <Q REND="inline">"I cannot ad|vi&s;e your lady&s;hip to &s;uch a &s;tep at pre&s;ent, al|though I think very highly of the young per|&s;on's di&s;cretion, and can well believe how much you mu&s;t wi&s;h to give a loo&s;e to tho&s;e feelings &s;o natural to a parent for an only child, and one &s;o well-de&s;erving of your love; but the &s;uddenne&s;s of the di&s;covery, and the agitations of a youthful &s;pirit, taken by &s;ur|prize in a matter of &s;uch con&s;equence, might overpower his prudence for the moment, and
<PB N="16" REF="19">
drive him upon a di&s;covery of the &s;ecret with|out any intention of betraying it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"'Tis exactly that which I &s;tand in dread of,"</Q> replied the lady; <Q REND="inline">"you &s;tate the ca&s;e cor|rectly as I feel it, and tho&s;e feelings, which I have never ventured to confide to any body but your&s;elf, would be &s;o hard to &s;uppre&s;s, were the object of them here pre&s;ent, that I am almo&s;t afraid of indulging my&s;elf with an interview. Yet again, when I con&s;ider how long I have been in the practice of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing what I feel, I think I may ri&s;que the meeting. He is not entirely new to my &s;ight, and if my &s;pirits &s;hould be too much agitated by what pa&s;&s;es, you will take mea&s;ures for bringing me to my recollection, and preventing con&s;e|quences that may be dangerous to us both; this you can pa&s;s off to the &s;core of indi&s;po&s;i|tion, and di&s;mi&s;s him when you &s;ee occa&s;ion: but if I can command my&s;elf &s;o far as to en|ter into conver&s;ation with him naturally, and without hazarding too much, you will leave me to make my own way with him in &s;uch a manner, as may enable me to gain &s;ome in|&s;ight into his character and under&s;tanding. As for his per&s;on, I told you how &s;triking the impre&s;&s;ion was that it made upon me, not
<PB N="17" REF="20">
only from its ab&s;olute but relative beauty, as bringing to my memory the very image of a father, who was, in my eyes at lea&s;t, the model of perfection. Alas! the traces of that fa|tally-beloved form are too deeply imprinted on my heart ever to be effaced by time; and if it was a crime to love, and be undone by loving him too well, &s;urely my &s;ufferings have been &s;uch as fully to atone for my improvident offence. To purcha&s;e pardon of a father, I con&s;ented to his wi&s;hes by marrying Lord Crowbery: How dreadful was that &s;acrifice! I had no heart to be&s;tow; that was gone with him, from whom I was &s;eparated as far as &s;ea and land and ob&s;tacles in&s;urmountable could divide us from each other, without a hope of ever meeting more on this &s;ide death. What has been his fate Heaven only knows! mine has been &s;orrowful enough, and what to other married women would be an irk&s;ome reflec|tion, is to me my only con&s;olation&mdash;I have never borne children to Lord Crowbery. At the &s;ame time, I am &s;en&s;ible how much this circum&s;tance contributes to embitter our do|me&s;tic peace, and aggravate that ill-humour, which my unwearied efforts cannot &s;oothe. Alas! how &s;hould they? He is quick enough to di&s;cern that the attentions I pay him, and
<PB N="18" REF="21">
the patience I exert, have no connection with the heart; that they are artificial virtues, be|come familiar by practice; and that I am in|debted to indifference only for the facility with which I perform them. If then I am thus expo&s;ed to his ill-humour for acting the part of a dutiful and obedient wife without the af|fections of one, what would be my fate &s;hould he di&s;cover me to have impo&s;ed upon him in a matter more derogatory to his honour, and for which no plea or extenuation could avail me? I tremble at the reflection: wonder not, therefore, if my terrors prevail over the long|ings of a mother's heart, and compel me to u&s;e the language of caution, whil&s;t my bo&s;om glows with all the ardour of affection."</Q></P>
<P>Whil&s;t Lady Crowbery was thus di&s;cour&s;ing, Henry had arrived, and being now announced by Bridget, order was given for his immediate admi&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>HENRY now entered the room, dre&s;&s;ed, as we have before ob&s;erved, in mourning for his departed friend, and with all that mo|de&s;t

grace, which was natural to him, ad|vanced a few &s;teps from the door, and then &s;topt &s;hort, as one that waits in humble &s;ilence to be &s;poken to.</P>
<P>The Doctor was &s;eated in his &s;ick chair; the lady oppo&s;ite to him and in full front of the intere&s;ting object that now &s;tood before her: It was a trying moment; &s;he glanced a look upon him that would have told him where to find a mother, had he met her eyes. All the advantages of per&s;on were now re|&s;tored to him by change of dre&s;s; but there were other circum&s;tances &s;till more attractive, that made this &s;econd interview peculiarly im|pre&s;&s;ive; what was at fir&s;t pre-&s;entiment was now become a certainty; the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that &s;he was actually in pre&s;ence of a new-di&s;covered unacknowledged &s;on, &s;truck on her heart like an electric &s;hock, as &s;udden and as &s;wift. She &s;tarted, &s;hivered, and with diffi|culty refrained from crying out, as Nature prompted her, <Q REND="inline">"My &s;on, my &s;on!"</Q> The very counterpart of that engaging form, that won her virgin heart, and triumphed over all re|&s;traints of duty and di&s;cretion, was in her eye; 'twas Delapoer him&s;elf re&s;tored to youth, or ri&s;en from the grave; the &s;ame fine &s;ymmetry of &s;hape, the &s;ame rich glow of manly beauty,
<PB N="20" REF="23">
that once &s;o fatally had charmed her in the father, was here transfu&s;ed into the &s;on, and brought pa&s;t &s;cenes &s;o full into review, as al|mo&s;t made them pre&s;ent.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Henry,"</Q> &s;ays &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"I find I have a claim in you, that by the death of Ratcliffe now de|volves upon me in full right and title: the object of his care henceforth belongs to me, and therefore wonder not to &s;ee me thus af|fected by &s;urprize and pity, having di&s;covered you to be the relict of my much-lamented friend.

<P>Here her voice failed, her agitation became extreme, and a di&s;charge of tears came &s;ea|&s;onably to her relief.

<P>Here &s;he ca&s;t a &s;crutinizing eye upon Henry, who&s;e cheeks were crim&s;on, con&s;cious as he was of &s;ome certain &s;en&s;ations, which the&s;e ad|monitory words did not exactly accord with.

evil de&s;igns in meditation again&s;t that poor girl, he was per&s;uaded they were harboured only in his treacherous heart.

As to any preference for one profe&s;&s;ion or employ above another, he &s;aid he had been in no condition to indulge &s;uch ideas, or pre&s;ume that it could in any ca&s;e be referred to him as matter of choice; ne|ce&s;&s;ity had been his mi&s;tre&s;s, and in his late extremity he had &s;een no other pro&s;pect before him for earning a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence but by carrying a mu&s;ket in the &s;ervice of his king:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"There,"</Q> added he, <Q REND="inline">"I might have laboured u&s;efully, or peri&s;hed honourably; for private &s;ervice I was little qualified, as my late kind ma&s;ter, now pre&s;ent, can witne&s;s; and perhaps I had be&s;ides &s;ome con&s;titutional repugnancies, which do no credit to my humility, and are the con&s;equences of an education given me by an indulgent patron, that filled my mind with higher notions than were &s;uited to my for|tune."</Q>&mdash;Then, rai&s;ing his eyes, and directing a

<P>The emotions which this energetic addre&s;s rai&s;ed in the maternal heart of Lady Crowbery, who &s;aw her unacknowledged &s;on now kneel|ing at her feet, were &s;uch as de&s;cription cannot reach; &s;he had thrown her arms about his neck, and was on the very in&s;tant point of de|claring
<PB N="25" REF="28">
her&s;elf to him, when at once a &s;udden cra&s;h &s;topt the words upon her lips; the door of the chamber bur&s;t inwards, and, &s;prawling with her face upon the floor and her heels in the air, behold the per&s;on of old Bridget! In&s;tantly the lady gave a &s;cream, and &s;tarted from her chair; Henry nimbly recovered his legs, con|&s;cious that the po&s;ture he was in could not be too &s;uddenly &s;hifted; whil&s;t Zachary roared out with a&s;toni&s;hment, making &s;everal demands in the name of the devil; to which Bridget, either being, or affecting to be, &s;tunned by her tumble, declined a reply, till being repeat|edly urged by the authority afore&s;aid to give &s;ome account of her&s;elf, and not finding it convenient to give the true one, &s;he pretended to have &s;lipped down as &s;he was pa&s;&s;ing ha&s;tily from her mi&s;tre&s;s's chamber, and falling with her whole weight again&s;t the door, bur&s;t it open: in the mean time Jemima's bell ringing a furious peal, Zachary bade her be|gone for a blundering old fool; which, as Henry had now &s;et her on her feet, &s;he thought fit to obey, and departed without more words.</P>
<P>In fact &s;he had effected pretty nearly all the purpo&s;es of her commi&s;&s;ion, having &s;pied out
<PB N="26" REF="29">
enough to form a very &s;ufficient report of the lady's good liking for Henry; and as &s;he had &s;een her throw her arms about his neck, with|out hearing what pa&s;&s;ed between them on the occa&s;ion, it mu&s;t be owned &s;he had &s;tronger circum&s;tances in proof than commonly fall to the &s;hare of reporters in ca&s;es of the like nature.</P>
<P>From too great zeal to di&s;cover more than the &s;mall horizon of a key-hole was calcu|lated to di&s;clo&s;e, Bridget had pre&s;&s;ed &s;o in|cautiou&s;ly upon the door, that the lock, which was none of the be&s;t, having treacherou&s;ly given way, &s;he fell as we have related head|long into the room, ju&s;t in time to &s;top the telling of that &s;ecret, which was the mo&s;t im|portant that &s;on could hear, or parent com|municate.</P>
<P>Great was the unea&s;ine&s;s which this unlucky accident occa&s;ioned to Lady Crowbery; and it was not without &s;ome pains on the part of Zachary &s;he was di&s;&s;uaded from taking cer|tain conciliatory mea&s;ures with the old woman, for &s;ealing her lips, on the pre&s;umption of her having &s;een more than was prudent to make public; but as he contended &s;trongly for Brid|get's incapacity of making ob&s;ervations, whil&s;t

her face was on the floor, it was finally judged advi&s;eable to let it pa&s;s in &s;ilence, and not create a danger by over-anxiety for preventing it. The alarm, however, had &s;o di&s;concerted Lady Crowbery, that &s;he had no re&s;olution to renew the conference, much le&s;s to touch upon that intere&s;ting di&s;covery &s;he was on the point of making, when Bridget interrupted her; &s;o that after a few words &s;pent in recommending Henry to remain quiet and out of &s;ight at the cottage, till he heard from her again, &s;he ha&s;tened to her fair companion, who was waiting for her in the carriage, and departed.</P>

<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER IV. Nothing &s;o furious as a Woman &s;corned.</HEAD>
<P>IT may well be &s;uppo&s;ed that Bridget lo&s;t no time in making her mi&s;tre&s;s acquainted with the cau&s;e of the di&s;turbance and noi&s;e, &s;he had heard in the Doctor's chamber, and al&s;o of what &s;he had there di&s;covered: as &s;he could give no account of their conver&s;ation, which was carried on in too low a key to reach her ears on the out&s;ide of the door, Jemima was left to her own imagination
<PB N="28" REF="31">
for finding out motives for a lady's embracing a hand&s;ome young man, whil&s;t he was kneel|ing at her feet, and the&s;e, according to Je|mima's notions, could be but of one &s;ort; &s;he therefore &s;et it down for certain in her own mind, that Lady Crowbery was de&s;|perately in love with Henry, that her hou&s;e was made a hou&s;e of a&s;&s;ignation, and her hu&s;band pander to an intrigue of the mo&s;t bare-faced nature.</P>
<P>The&s;e conclu&s;ions &s;he had no &s;ooner formed, than &s;he di&s;cerned at a glance all the advan|tages they gave her in a certain project, which &s;he had long meditated, without being able to bring it into any practicable &s;hape. Henry, who &s;eemed to have e&s;caped out of her hands, was by this lucky circum&s;tance more than ever at her mercy; and though &s;he was &s;en&s;ibly piqued at the preference given to a rival very little her junior in age, and, in her own opinion at lea&s;t, not at all her &s;uperior in charms, yet &s;he was well plea&s;ed to be paid for her mor|tification, by having po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;ecret, the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of which no &s;acrifice on his part could be too great for, whil&s;t there was &s;uch a per&s;on in being as Lord Crowbery; neither was &s;he &s;orry to find that Henry's
<PB N="29" REF="32">
&s;cruples were not &s;o general as &s;he thought them, nor his virtue above price: the in|ference &s;he drew from all this was, that the menace of a di&s;covery &s;o fatal to both parties, could not fail to draw him into her mea&s;ures, as effectually as Lady Crowbery's money had bribed him into her's; and as delicacy was no part of Jemima's character, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions were as violent as her &s;oul was mean, the heart of Henry was not her object; nor were any gratifications unacceptable to her, becau&s;e not granted with good will, for plea&s;ure was plea&s;ure in her calculation of it, though it were extorted by terror, or gained by artifice and trick.</P>
<P>Her fir&s;t care, therefore, was to bind Brid|get to &s;trict &s;ecrecy for the pre&s;ent, that &s;o the parties, being under no alarm, might con|tinue their meetings, till proofs of a more deci&s;ive nature might be obtained again&s;t them: her next &s;olicitude was to procure an inter|view with Henry, and for this purpo&s;e &s;he di&s;patched the old woman to way-lay him before he left the hou&s;e. This &s;ucceeded to her wi&s;h, for he no &s;ooner received her &s;um|mons than he obeyed it, prompted, as we may pre&s;ume, by de&s;ire to a&s;certain, from her con|ver&s;ation,
<PB N="30" REF="33">
whether any reports had been made to her, that might affect Lady Crowbery.</P>
<P>Upon his pre&s;enting him&s;elf to Jemima, &s;he received him with an air of joyful &s;urprize, congratulating him on his good fortune, and prai&s;ing Lady Crowbery to the &s;kies for her charity: &s;he a&s;&s;ured him of the &s;incere plea&s;ure &s;he took in &s;eeing him thus happily extricated out of all his trouble, and by the favour of his kind patrone&s;s rais'd to a &s;ituation, which &s;o well became him; and as &s;he was per&s;uaded that his noble friend wou'd not fail to go through with the good work &s;he had &s;et her hand to, &s;he cou'd not &s;uppo&s;e that Goody May's cottage wou'd be any longer a fit re&s;i|dence for him, either on his own account or the lady's.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Was it not better,"</Q> &s;he a&s;ked, <Q REND="inline">"for him to abide where he was, where his good friend might &s;ee him as often as &s;he thought fit, without drawing any body's eyes upon her, as &s;he was in daily habits of con|&s;ulting the Doctor, and of cour&s;e her vi&s;its wou'd be pa&s;s'd to his account."</Q></P>
<P>Upon Henry's ob&s;erving that Lady Crow|bery's actions required no cover, &s;he quickly replied, that nobody held that lady's character in higher e&s;teem than her&s;elf; that &s;he knew
<PB N="31" REF="34">
well enough &s;he had nothing to fear on the &s;core of reputation, if the world wou'd report nothing but truth; but as &s;uch fair dealing was not to be expected, e&s;pecially in her ca&s;e, who had &s;o many evil-minded &s;pies upon her, and &s;o moro&s;e a hu&s;band to deal with, &s;he mu&s;t think that too great caution cou'd not be taken to provide again&s;t con&s;equences&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"For alas! poor lady,"</Q> added &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"I am afraid, that with all her virtues and all her charities, &s;he is &s;carce credited for the one by her jealous lord, and ill rewarded for the other by her thankle&s;s neighbours."</Q></P>
<P>Jemima carried on this hypocri&s;y with &s;o much addre&s;s, that Henry began to think &s;he was &s;incere, at lea&s;t he was per&s;uaded that nothing had been &s;aid to her by Bridget, and of cour&s;e nothing &s;een. As to his continuance at the cottage, he &s;aw it nearly in the &s;ame light with Jemima; Lady Crowbery her&s;elf had &s;tated objections to it, and his own re|flections &s;ugge&s;ted many more; what Jemima had ob&s;erved with re&s;pect to the commodiou&s;|ne&s;s of her own hou&s;e was perfectly well founded, and as &s;he betrayed no one &s;ymptom of her former propen&s;ity, but talked and looked with compo&s;ure and &s;edatene&s;s, he was
<PB N="32" REF="35">
half inclined to accept of her propo&s;al. There were other thoughts, however, that cro&s;&s;ed him in this determination, and they required further reflection. He &s;aw all the danger of his &s;itua|tion with Lady Crowbery; the ardour with which &s;he had cla&s;ped him in her arms was more than he could account for, and gave him &s;erious alarm; gratitude had prompted him, in an unguarded moment, to throw him|&s;elf on his knees at her feet; the emotion on his part was natural, and the &s;ource from which it &s;prung pure and re&s;pectful, but what could be the motive with a per&s;on of her de|licacy and decorum for a mark of &s;en&s;ibility &s;o extraordinary and unexpected? Charity he could well under&s;tand to be kind and con|de&s;cending, but charity is not called upon to embrace, to care&s;s the object it relieves. The act was an indication of &s;omething more than pity; it followed upon his claiming her pro|tection as a parent, and it &s;eemed to be in&s;pired by all the tenderne&s;s and affection of the cha|racter &s;he adopted: How was he to interpret it?</P>
<P>Whil&s;t he was &s;ilently revolving the&s;e thoughts in his mind, Jemima's eyes were fixed upon him, and the &s;ame contemplation that
<PB N="33" REF="36">
in&s;pired her with hope, in&s;pired her with de|&s;ire: the colour ru&s;hed into her cheeks, her countenance underwent a change, that did not e&s;cape him&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Henry,"</Q> &s;he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I hope you are re&s;olved to accept my invitation; I have every di&s;po&s;ition to be your friend that you can wi&s;h me to have; I will &s;erve you, a&s;&s;i&s;t you, accommodate you in all points and purpo&s;es, and be as &s;ecret as your own thoughts: with my friend&s;hip your fortune is made, without it you are ruin'd, lo&s;t and undone."</Q></P>
<P>Henry &s;tared at her with &s;urprize; he &s;aw the &s;torm gathering, but knew not where it would bur&s;t; nor could rightly divine what either her promi&s;es or her menaces alluded to: he de&s;ired her to explain her&s;elf.</P>
<P>She pau&s;ed for recollection, and &s;eemed he&s;itating whether to proceed or to retract: probably it was her wi&s;h that &s;he had not precipitated her&s;elf into this dilemma, till matters had been riper for her purpo&s;e, but &s;he had already gone too far to avail her&s;elf of a retreat; it was too late, the die was ca&s;t, and &s;he mu&s;t &s;tand to the throw. <Q REND="inline">"Well then,"</Q> &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline">"&s;ince you do not, or will not, under&s;tand me, &s;it down, and I
<PB N="34" REF="37">
will, as you de&s;ire, explain my&s;elf to you without re&s;erve. To prove to you therefore in a word how &s;incerely I mean to deal with you, I &s;hall begin by confe&s;&s;ing to you hone&s;tly and freely that I love you: Nay, do not &s;tart from me, nor meditate an e&s;cape, for accord|ingly as you treat my &s;ecret I will treat your's; therefore I mu&s;t be heard: yes, Henry, I love you; but take notice, I am not &s;o unrea&s;on|able as to aim at engro&s;&s;ing either your atten|tions or affections; nay, I am &s;o much your friend, that I am content to be &s;econd and &s;ubordinate in your regards, for I will not &s;tand in the way of your better fortune, nor traver&s;e any of your plans and a&s;&s;ignations with a richer, if not a fairer, lady; but where I know, and can depo&s;e upon oath, that you have been fa&s;t lock'd in her arm's, I tell you ingenuou&s;ly that mine &s;hall not be long empty, nor &s;hall my pa&s;&s;ion be &s;lighted, whil&s;t Lady Crowbery's is gratified."</Q></P>
<P>Horror-&s;truck with this dreadful alternative, Henry remained for &s;ome moments deprived as it &s;hould &s;eem both of &s;en&s;e and motion, and incapable of a reply. To chu&s;e between in|famy and ruin, had the danger been all his own, would have co&s;t him little deliberation;
<PB N="35" REF="38">
but the fir&s;t gloomy pro&s;pect that opened upon him, was that of his benefactre&s;s &s;acrificed on his account; he &s;aw her in his imagination &s;ummoned before her &s;urly tyrant, arraigned, condemned, and delivered over to infamy and di&s;grace: At the &s;ame time his very nature re|volted from the loath&s;ome means propo&s;ed for preventing this calamity; and was it after all a &s;ecurity to be relied upon? What &s;ecret could be &s;afe with a character &s;o abandoned, and a temper &s;o outrageous, as Jemima's? None: to what purpo&s;e then &s;hould he involve him&s;elf in turpitude and guilt, when he could neither keep misfortune from his benefactre&s;s by &s;uch mea&s;ures, nor endure his own remor&s;e of con|&s;cience in the mean time? And though inno|cence might not &s;erve either Lady Crowbery or him&s;elf as a defence again&s;t the malice of Jemima and the inju&s;tice of my Lord, yet was he well convinced that nothing in this life could compen&s;ate for the lo&s;s of it: So far, however, he would yield to the pre&s;&s;ure of the moment for the &s;ake of gaining time, as not to irritate Jemima's temper by too peremptory a repul&s;e: He attempted therefore to &s;oothe her by the following expo&s;tulation:</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="39"><Q REND="inline">"Though I take Heaven to witne&s;s that I am as innocent in thought and deed towards the lady you allude to as the child unborn; and though from my &s;oul I believe &s;he is as pure in nature as un&s;ullied &s;now; yet I know the peril &s;he wou'd incur, and can well con|ceive the malicious interpretation her inno|cence wou'd be expo&s;ed to, was you &s;o cruelly bent upon her de&s;truction, as to &s;et forth the circum&s;tance, which Bridget has reported to you, in it's wor&s;t colours to her ungenerous lord: I know how ea&s;y it would be for preju|dice like his by fal&s;e con&s;tructions to represent an expre&s;&s;ion of pity as an act of criminality, and turn the world again&s;t her to the ruin of her reputation: But this wou'd be a degree of inhumanity which can never enter into your heart; I am per&s;uaded your nature is not ca|pable of compa&s;&s;ing the de&s;truction of an ami|able and innocent woman by &s;uch horrid means. For my part, &s;ooner than I wou'd be party in &s;uch a deed, I wou'd meet death it&s;elf, in whatever &s;hape of terror and torment it approach'd me; and believe me, Madam, could I &s;u&s;pect you capable of going the&s;e lengths in revenge for any want of attention, which your partiality for me might interpret

into &s;lights, I would rather my life &s;hould atone for the offence, than that Lady Crow|bery's peace or reputation &s;hould be &s;acrificed through my ill-conduct or neglect."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Very well,"</Q> replied Jemima, <Q REND="inline">"then it is in your power to decide upon the fate of that lady, who is &s;o infinitely dear to you, by propor|tioning your attentions to the value that you &s;et upon my &s;ecrecy."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Prove me then,"</Q> he cried; <Q REND="inline">"tax me to the extent of my capacity in any hone&s;t &s;er|vices; and mark if I decline the trial."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Hone&s;t &s;ervices!"</Q> &s;he repeated; <Q REND="inline">"what are they? I have made a fair confe&s;&s;ion to you, Henry, and I will not be trifled with."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I pre&s;ume,"</Q> an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">"you have a &s;en&s;e of that religion you profe&s;s &s;o zealou&s;ly; you have a proper feeling for the dignity and delicacy of your &s;ex; you have a recollection of tho&s;e &s;olemn promi&s;es, to which you pledg'd your faith at the altar&mdash;"</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER V. Mi&s;cellaneous Matters.</HEAD>
<P>AS our hero &s;lowly directed his &s;teps to|wards the ho&s;pitable cottage, pondering the preceding dialogue in his mind, a thou&s;and di&s;tracting thoughts took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of him by turns: &s;ometimes he reproached him&s;elf for not having attempted to &s;oothe Jemima with hopes and promi&s;es; at other times he almo&s;t doubted if he ought not to have &s;acrificed every &s;cruple for Lady Crowbery's &s;ake; again his &s;pirit ro&s;e again&s;t &s;uch gro&s;s impurity, and the fallacy of the maxim <Q REND="inline">'of doing evil that good might come'</Q> &s;truck him in full force.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"If innocence,"</Q> he cried, <Q REND="inline">"can be no other|wi&s;e protected than by the commi&s;&s;ion of guilt, let it &s;hift for it&s;elf."</Q> To appeal to the Doctor was to rou&s;e a &s;u&s;picion in Jemima, that he had betrayed her to him, and that he fore&s;aw would be the certain way to drive her upon retaliation; be&s;ides, he knew the amount of Zachary's authority, and how little good was to be looked for from his interference: to apprize Lady Crowbery of her danger was his anxious wi&s;h, but by what means he knew not, for neither interview nor letter &s;eemed
<PB N="41" REF="44">
either ea&s;y or &s;afe to undertake. Ezekiel's fidelity could not be doubted, but as a coun|&s;ellor in this ca&s;e, few men could be found le&s;s qualified.</P>
<P>Henry had now cro&s;&s;ed the green, and was making towards the cottage, when he heard him&s;elf acco&s;ted by a man in a plain drab riding-coat, and booted, who a&s;ked him if that great hou&s;e at a di&s;tance belonged to Lord Crow|bery? Henry, who had ju&s;t then little or no attention for any thing but the thoughts he was immer&s;ed in, &s;tared rather wildly at the &s;tranger, and in a peevi&s;h kind of tone an|&s;wered, that he knew nothing at all of the matter.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"That is rather extraordinary,"</Q> re|plied the &s;tranger, <Q REND="inline">"for I think I &s;aw you come from the hou&s;e, where Lady Crowbery has been; and if you are bound to that cot|tage, you are going where &s;he is."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"And what is that to you, Sir?"</Q> demanded Henry, in the &s;ame tone, and abruptly turned away from him. He now quickened his pace, and, entering the cottage kitchen, found there Eze|kiel and Dame May, who immediately gave him the &s;ignal for &s;ilence, telling him, in a whi&s;per, that Lady Crowbery and Mi&s;s Man|&s;tock were in the inner room conferring with
<PB N="42" REF="45">
Su&s;an;&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"And I hope,"</Q> added the dame, <Q REND="inline">"that our girl is in a way to get a place with one of them."</Q></P>
<P>The good dame conjectured rightly, for tho&s;e ladies had been que&s;tioning Su&s;an May upon certain preliminary circum&s;tances, proper to be well explained before any overture was made on Mi&s;s Man&s;tock's part for hiring her as her waiting-woman. The points, which Su&s;an had to clear, were &s;imply what aro&s;e from the a&s;per&s;ions Blachford had ca&s;t upon her with re&s;pect to Henry; and being &s;traitly interrogated on the &s;ubject by Lady Crowbery, &s;he an&s;wered, without prevarication or re&s;erve, that to be &s;ure &s;he could not deny a very &s;in|cere e&s;teem for Henry, as who could help liking one every way &s;o worthy and &s;o engag|ing? but as to what that ba&s;e man, Mr. Blachford, imputed to her, &s;he denied it ut|terly. It would be well for him, &s;he ob&s;erved, if he had one grain of that honour which Henry po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in &s;uch a degree, that &s;he believed he would die a thou&s;and deaths rather than be guilty of &s;uch ba&s;ene&s;s as that vile man had meditated again&s;t her: &s;he then related the particulars of his attempt upon her when &s;he &s;olicited him to relea&s;e Henry from the &s;tocks.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="46">When both ladies had joined in expre&s;&s;ing their ju&s;t abhorrence of &s;uch proceeding, with proper commendations of Su&s;an's conduct, &s;he again re&s;umed her confe&s;&s;ion of attachment to Henry; and after a very animated enumera|tion of his many excellent qualities, mental and per&s;onal, concluded by humbly a&s;king par|don of her hearers for intruding &s;o long upon their patience.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"But you, Madam,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to Lady Crowbery, <Q REND="inline">"I know to be &s;o kind and con&s;iderate, that I am &s;ure you will forgive a poor girl like me if I have &s;aid too much, for you know a heart too full will overflow; and to be &s;ure, though I have not the mo&s;t di&s;tant idea of a&s;piring to Mr. Henry, who I dare &s;ay is as much above me in birth as he is in merit and under&s;tand|ing, yet I hope it is no &s;in to love him, to pray for his happine&s;s and pro&s;perity, and to ble&s;s and reverence, as from my &s;oul I do, all tho&s;e who are good to him, and your lady&s;hip above all."</Q></P>
<P>Su&s;an cea&s;ed, and whil&s;t the tears flowed from her &s;oft eyes, a &s;ympathetic &s;hower be|dewed the cheeks of Lady Crowbery; the lovely I&s;abella (for lovely &s;he was, gentle reader, and fair beyond my powers of de&s;cription) was &s;o
<PB N="44" REF="47">
plea&s;ed with the &s;incere and natural character of the girl, that turning to her with a gracious &s;mile, and addre&s;&s;ing her in a voice as tune|able as the lyre of Apollo, &s;he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;o charmed with your &s;incerity, Su&s;an, that if my place is acceptable to you, we are agreed: from this moment you belong to me; and if the malice of Mr. Blachford attempts &s;till to pur&s;ue you, depend upon it neither he nor his &s;lander will find admi&s;&s;ion where I am. As for your attachment to this young per&s;on, whom you de&s;cribe &s;o amiable, though my hard heart has never been touched by the pa&s;|&s;ion of love, and I do not &s;o much as gue&s;s what it means, I have neverthele&s;s all the compa&s;&s;ion in life for tho&s;e who &s;uffer by it; and for you, Su&s;an, in particular, who are out of hope of obtaining the object you admire. You mu&s;t therefore &s;trive to forget him as fa&s;t as you can, which, I &s;hou'd &s;uppo&s;e, you can find no difficulty in doing."</Q></P>
<P>Su&s;an &s;hook her head, but &s;aid nothing: a certain look, which Lady Crowbery be&s;towed upon her fair cou&s;in, was perhaps not mi&s;in|terpreted, when &s;he corrected her&s;elf by &s;aying,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I conclude I have been blundering upon &s;omething perfectly ab&s;urd, which is not to be
<PB N="45" REF="48">
wonder'd at when one talks without under&s;tand|ing what one talks about. You know, cou&s;in, I have never been in Su&s;an's &s;ituation; and as all my wi&s;hes have been con&s;tantly prevented by an indulgent father, I really never felt what cou'd &s;eriou&s;ly be called a di&s;appointment of any &s;ort: in love, at lea&s;t, I can venture to &s;ay, I am pretty &s;ecure,"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Don't be too &s;e|cure,"</Q> cried Lady Crowbery, tapping her gently on the cheek as &s;he ro&s;e from her chair. And now the ladies, followed by Su&s;an May, entered the room, where Ezekiel, Henry, and Goody May, were a&s;&s;embled.</P>
<P>The happy news was here announced, of Su&s;an's being preferred to wait upon the per|&s;on of Mi&s;s Man&s;tock. This was the height of all earthly happine&s;s that could befall the mother of Su&s;an; and if &s;he her&s;elf did not welcome it with quite the &s;ame tran&s;port, it was not want of value for her young mi&s;tre&s;s, that damped her joy, for all the neighbour|hood rung with I&s;abella's prai&s;e, and Sir Roger Man&s;tock was univer&s;ally beloved; but there was a pang at the heart of that fond girl, which in the very moment of her good fortune drew a &s;igh from her brea&s;t, and directed her eyes towards Henry with the mo&s;t pen&s;ive expre&s;|&s;ion:
<PB N="46" REF="49">
this glance was not unnoticed by I&s;a|bella, who followed it in its pa&s;&s;age to the countenance of our hero, which being ju&s;t then over&s;pread with a tender blu&s;h, and character|ed with the fine&s;t touches that pity and bene|volence could give it, was perhaps in nature the mo&s;t dangerous object that a young lady, who had &s;o lately &s;et love at defiance, could encounter; and, was I poetically given, I &s;hould here take occa&s;ion to introduce that re|vengeful deity taking aim from behind the per&s;on of my hero, like Teucer covered by the &s;hield of Ajax, and launching at the heart of I&s;abella one of his &s;wifte&s;t and mo&s;t fatal arrows. Certain it it, there was &s;ome bu&s;y me&s;&s;enger or other, that flitted in that moment on his malicious errand, and, whi&s;pering in her ear, forewarned her, that the god of love was not to be affronted with impunity. The &s;ame, perhaps, or &s;ome &s;i&s;ter &s;pirit equally bent upon mi&s;chief, threw an accident in the way of their returning in the carriage, by taking off a &s;hoe from one of the hor&s;es, and compelling the driver to re&s;ort to the black&s;mith for a repair of the damage.</P>
<P>This being reported, I&s;abella quickly pro|po&s;ed a walk through the plantations, which
<PB N="47" REF="50">
her lady cou&s;in as quickly clo&s;ed with, happy in the excu&s;e for taking her beloved Henry with her. It was in vain therefore that the fooli&s;h &s;ervant a&s;&s;ured his lady the jobb would be done in a few minutes; his evidence was in&s;tantly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and the ladies adju&s;ting their cloaks, &s;et forward without li&s;tening to any further demur, accompanied by our hero, blooming with every mode&s;t grace that beauty, youth, and &s;en&s;ibility, could unite to adorn him with.</P>
<P>When they entered the plantation they were &s;ecure from being overlooked, and then the mother, who&s;e heart yearned towards her new-di&s;covered trea&s;ure, pretending to want &s;up|port, pa&s;&s;ed her arm under his, and in&s;tinc|tively pre&s;&s;ed it to her heart, giving him at the &s;ame time a look of unutterable fondne&s;s. The action was &s;o marked as not to be mi&s;un|der&s;tood: Henry felt it, and turned pale with alarm; &s;eized with a &s;udden faintne&s;s, he &s;eemed not le&s;s in want of &s;upport than the lady her&s;elf: &s;he &s;aw his change of counte|nance, &s;he perceived him tremble as &s;he leant upon him, and perfectly comprehended all the delicacy and di&s;tre&s;s of his &s;en&s;ations: con|cealment was no longer generous, it was no
<PB N="48" REF="51">
longer &s;afe; nay, it was now no longer in her power. He had &s;topt &s;hort from incapacity to proceed; their mutual embarra&s;&s;ment was too con&s;picuous to be overlooked by I&s;abella, had &s;he been ever &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly accommo|dating; but of the&s;e arts &s;he was perfectly ig|norant, and had already run to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her cou&s;in, very naturally alarmed at her &s;ituation, and was tendering a bottle of &s;alts to her; when that lady, in the tendere&s;t tone, ex|claimed,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Oh! my &s;weet friend, my beloved I&s;abella, judge not unfavourably of me for the uncommon &s;en&s;ibility, the &s;trong emotions, which you &s;ee me &s;eized with: I knew the pa|rents of this youth; dear to me they were as my own life, near as the blood that flows from my own heart."</Q>&mdash;Here &s;he fell upon Henry's neck, and in her agony &s;obbed aloud.</P>
<P>At this in&s;tant the per&s;on of the Vi&s;count was &s;een advancing towards them in the &s;ame walk: there was no further time for explana|tion; &s;carce a moment remained for reflec|tion; Henry was bidden to retire with all &s;peed; Lady Crowbery &s;truggled to compo&s;e her&s;elf for the dreaded rencontre; the affec|tionate I&s;abella was employed in chearing and
<PB N="49" REF="52">
&s;upporting her; but the interval was momen|tary, and my Lord at hand.</P>
<P>It was &s;o unu&s;ual a thing with him to walk at this hour of day, and in this place, that no|thing could be more unlooked for than this meeting: he had now &s;een with his own eyes a confirmation of what had already been re|ported to him by Blachford. That gentleman, enraged at &s;eeing all his de&s;igns upon Su&s;an May traver&s;ed by the interference of Henry, and her re&s;ignation of Jemima's &s;ervice, had paid a vi&s;it to that di&s;con&s;olate dame within a a very few minutes after our hero had left her in a &s;tate of mind little &s;hort of ab&s;olute phrenzy: inflamed as &s;he was to the heighth with rage, indignation, and revenge, the flat|tering attentions of that in&s;idious vi&s;itor, who&s;e gro&s;s appetites could <HI>batten on a moor,</HI> gained thereby the knowledge of an important di&s;co|very, and &s;he the gratification of a revengeful pa&s;&s;ion, well knowing to what malicious pur|po&s;es he would apply the &s;ecret &s;he had im|parted to him.</P>
<P>The meeting between the Vi&s;count and his lady, from which &s;o many dreadful reproaches were expected, went off without any; a few words in pa&s;&s;ing, and tho&s;e addre&s;&s;ed to mi&s;s
<PB N="50" REF="53">
Man&s;tock, were all that occurred; but Lady Crowbery di&s;covered enough in the &s;ullenne&s;s of his look to awaken all her apprehen&s;ions, nor was &s;he deceived in her ob&s;ervations: My Lord pur&s;ued his way towards Ju&s;tice Blachford's, and the ladies held on their walk and their di&s;cour&s;e till they arrived at the ca&s;|tle.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Henry had pa&s;&s;ed the plantation|gate that opened upon the village-green, he was again acco&s;ted by the &s;tranger in the hor&s;e|man's coat, who told him he had ju&s;t picked up a ring in the foot-path, which he conceived had been dropt there by Lady Crowbery as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed, and begged him to take the charge of returning it to her, as he him&s;elf was upon the wing, and could not undertake the delivery of it in per&s;on.</P>
<P>Henry took the ring, examined it, was con|vinced that it belonged to Lady Crowbery; and recollecting that his former treatment of this per&s;on, when he broke in upon his meditations, had been none of the mo&s;t courteous, he was the more de&s;irous to make up for it by his ci|vility on this occa&s;ion: the man &s;eemed in that &s;tyle of life as might be complimented on his hone&s;ty without an affront to his dignity.
<PB N="51" REF="54">
The ring was of value, for it con&s;i&s;ted of a ta|ble diamond &s;et in the &s;hape of a heart, under which was a plait of hair, with the words <HI>Cecilia Adamant,</HI> neatly engraved upon the back of the &s;etting. This, Henry ob&s;erved, being the maiden-name of Lady Crowbery, was a proof of it's belonging to her, and he therefore &s;ugge&s;ted it to him as proper to be delivered by his own hands, the meanne&s;s of his appear|ance warranting to add, that he was per&s;uaded that generous lady would wi&s;h to make a &s;uit|able return to the finder.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I under&s;tand your kind hint,"</Q> replied the man, <Q REND="inline">"and am thankful to you for it; if her Lady&s;hip &s;hould be plea&s;ed in her bounty to take any con&s;idera|tion for the finder of this trinket, be &s;o good to tell her, it is a poor man lately returned from tran&s;portation, who will thankfully receive her favours through your hands; but as I don't think it &s;afe to put my&s;elf in the way of Lord Crowbery, circum&s;tanced as I am, &s;o I do mo&s;t earne&s;tly conjure you not to give the ring to my Lady in his pre&s;ence, nor to let any inti|mation reach him that may expo&s;e me to be traced as the finder of it: for the pre&s;ent, it will not be prudent for me to tarry here any longer; &s;ometime hence I may call upon you

again."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Sometime hence,"</Q> replied Henry, <Q REND="inline">"I may chance not to be found here; but call at that cottage, and whatever is there depo&s;ited will be hone&s;tly delivered to you by the good people of the hou&s;e: you know your own dan|ger be&s;t, but if returning from tran&s;portation con&s;titutes any part of it, I &s;hould think you had better have been &s;ilent on that head; how|ever, you may depend upon it I &s;hall not be|tray your tru&s;t either in one ca&s;e or the other."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sir,"</Q> rejoined the &s;tranger, <Q REND="inline">"permit me to &s;ay, there is &s;omething in your countenance that a&s;&s;ures me I might repo&s;e greater tru&s;ts than this in your keeping without hazard; the good woman of the cottage you pointed to has made me acquainted with your adventures in this place, and you mu&s;t allow me to &s;ay that I honour you from my &s;oul: though I have been a guilty man in my time (which you will readily believe, having told you I am newly return'd from tran&s;portation) yet I love virtue, and reverence brave, humane and vir|tuous per&s;ons like you: I have been al&s;o told of Lady Crowbery's genero&s;ity to you, and I applaud her for it; charity is a lovely quality, but frailty is of the very e&s;&s;ence of woman;
<PB N="53" REF="56">

<P>This &s;aid, he ha&s;tily turned away, and be|fore our hero could recover the &s;urprize which a &s;peech &s;o unexpected had thrown him into, the &s;tranger was out of &s;ight.</P>

<P>WHEN Henry returned to the cottage, he found Ezekiel &s;itting with old Weevil, the miller, who had come to report the convale|&s;cence of his &s;on; and as he really bore a grate|ful mind towards our hero, it was with great plea&s;ure he congratulated him on the happy change in his fortune and appearance: he then began to &s;ound forth the prai&s;es of Lady Crowbery for her charities; and when he had run on in this &s;train for &s;ome time, frequently appealing to Henry, who made no reply, he looked at him with a degree of &s;urprize, and &s;aid,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"How is this, friend Henry? You &s;ay nothing all this while."</Q>&mdash;Our hero now an|&s;wered, that if he was &s;ilent on the &s;ubject, it
<PB N="54" REF="57">
was not from want of gratitude, but becau&s;e he knew that Lady did not wi&s;h her good deeds to be talked of.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Heyday!"</Q> cried Weevil, <Q REND="inline">"what is the value of a good deed, if the world does not know it? For my part, if I do a man a kind turn, I am the fir&s;t to let him hear of it; for where would be the plea|&s;ure of doing it el&s;e; and how can I expect a return of the &s;ame kindne&s;s, if I don't let him under&s;tand from whence it came?"</Q>&mdash;Then turning to Ezekiel, who did not &s;eem to reli&s;h his notions, and had exhibited certain tokens that they would not pa&s;s unque&s;tioned, he de|manded of him, with an air of raillery, if he preached &s;uch &s;ort of charity as that lady was &s;uppo&s;ed to practi&s;e?</P>
<P>Ezekiel ro&s;e from his &s;eat, and drawing him|&s;elf up into an erect po&s;ture, as his cu&s;tom was when he debated any intere&s;ting point&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Neighbour Weevil,"</Q> he cried, <Q REND="inline">"you demand of me, as a preacher, if I recommend to my flock &s;uch &s;ort of charity as this good lady practi&s;eth; and I demand of thee, as a Chri&s;|tian, if thy pa&s;tor hath never taught thee that good le&s;&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"Let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth?"</Q></Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I hope I know that without his telling,"</Q>
<PB N="55" REF="58">
quoth the miller, <Q REND="inline">"for &s;urely no man would put his hand into his neighbour's &s;ack, and be fool enough to blazon his own &s;hame; I think he would be but a &s;illy fellow, who did not keep his own council in &s;uch a ca&s;e; but that any one &s;hould be a&s;hamed of giving away their alms, and take no credit for what they be&s;tow, &s;eems to me an unaccountable piece of bu&s;ine&s;s; for why &s;hould I lay out my money and get nothing for it?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And is it nothing,"</Q> cried the preacher, elevating his voice, and ri&s;ing on his in&s;teps, <Q REND="inline">"to purcha&s;e that divine &s;en&s;ation, which &s;prings within the human brea&s;t when we re|lieve the &s;ufferings of a fellow-creature? Is the &s;elf-approving te&s;timony of a good con|&s;cience nothing worth, unle&s;s echoed back upon thee by the applau&s;es of the world? The eye of the Almighty is upon the deeds of men, whether they be good or evil; nay, more than that, it penetrates to the heart, and di&s;cerns the motives and &s;ecret &s;prings which govern it. Is it not enough for man to know, that he, who &s;eeth in &s;ecret, will reward us openly? I hope, friend Weevil, thou art not a man of that phari&s;aical kidney, as loveth greetings in the
<PB N="56" REF="59">
market-place, and delighteth to blow a trum|pet before thee."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I blow a trumpet!"</Q> replied the miller, &s;omewhat angrily; <Q REND="inline">"I don't know what you mean by &s;u&s;pecting me of &s;uch mountebank tricks; and as for greetings in the market-place, whether I love 'em or not is no matter; but I have plenty of them without a&s;king for, for I don't go there without my money; they are glad enough to greet me, friend Zekiel, for I am a fair trader, do you &s;ee, and neither blow trumpet or horn to call cu&s;tomers about me, and bring gri&s;t to my mill: No, no, if they like my dealings they are welcome; if not, let 'em go el&s;ewhere. If the mill were never to go till I blew a trumpet, it wou'd &s;tand &s;till to everla&s;ting for me; but I can't &s;ay &s;o much for you, Doctor, in your way of trade; you may be &s;aid to blow a trumpet, methinks, when you are perch'd up in a tree, hooting and howling and preaching the end of the world to a parcel of poor &s;car'd wretches, that are ready, through fright, to hang them|&s;elves upon the branches of it: this I call blowing a trumpet, ma&s;ter Zekiel,"</Q> added he, <Q REND="inline">"and &s;uch a trumpet it is, that with my good
<PB N="57" REF="60">
will &s;hall never enter the&s;e ears whil&s;t they are fixt to my head."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Be it &s;o, &s;corner, be it &s;o,"</Q> replied the preacher: <Q REND="inline">"if thy heart be harden'd even to the con&s;i&s;tency of one of thine own mill-&s;tones, who&s;e misfortune is it but thine own? Pha|raoh's heart was al&s;o in like ca&s;e, he was har|den'd again&s;t the warnings of the meek man Mo&s;es, and what was his fate? Whelm'd in the red &s;ea, &s;wallow'd up, drown'd, Gaffer Weevil, drown'd I &s;ay, as thou perchance may'&s;t be for a judgment in thine own mill-tail; which, God forbid! for I would rather wi&s;h thee to live and to repent: nay, hath not a judgment fallen upon thee already, a terrible judgment, from which thou art newly e&s;|cap'd? and wilt thou not obey the warning, as holy David obey'd, when the Lord &s;mote the &s;on of Bath&s;heba for his &s;ins? Will nothing awaken thee but the la&s;t trump, thou deaf adder?"</Q></P>
<P>Here Ezekial Daw turned his eyes towards the place, that had lately been occupied by the per&s;on of Weevil, and di&s;covered nothing there within his ken &s;ave an old elbow-chair, lite|rally as void of edification as the deaf adder; miller Weevil having neither carried that
<PB N="58" REF="61">
away with him, nor one &s;ingle word of in&s;truc|tion from the late expo&s;tulatory harangue. <Q REND="inline">"I prote&s;t,"</Q> quoth Ezekiel, as he looked about for Weevil, <Q REND="inline">"the man hath di&s;appear'd, and the <HI>chair of the &s;corner</HI> is left empty: Good hope,"</Q> added he, &s;itting down in it at the &s;ame time, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall not offend again&s;t the P&s;al|mi&s;t's precept by placing my&s;elf in his &s;tead."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No fear of that,"</Q> &s;aid Henry, <Q REND="inline">"the words are not to be taken in their literal &s;en&s;e"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Humph!"</Q> replied the preacher, <Q REND="inline">"don't be too &s;ure of that, young man; it is early day for &s;uch as thou art to &s;et up for an expounder of holy writ."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I beg pardon,"</Q> an&s;wered the youth; <Q REND="inline">"if I had been aware there could have been two opinions in the ca&s;e, I &s;hould have held back my own till I heard what your's was."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"All is well,"</Q> rejoined the other, <Q REND="inline">"I do not reprove thee, child, but for thy good; I would warn thee again&s;t the example of that froward man, who hath newly departed in his error, and &s;uddenly di&s;appeared, whil&s;t my eye was not upon him:"</Q>&mdash;A circum&s;tance, that could hardly have happened to any other per|&s;on than Ezekiel, who&s;e eye, like the poet's, had been rolling in &s;o fine a phren&s;y, that the miller and every other per&s;on about him might

have walked out of company at that moment without his &s;eeing them.</P>
<P>The good man, who, as we have before ob|&s;erved, was only patient upon principle, had been not a little nettled at the retort of the trumpet, which being a martial in&s;trument, had &s;ounded a note in his ear, that had &s;ome what rou&s;ed the natural ardour of his &s;pirit; a hint, which we think fit to give to the &s;aga|cious reader, who might el&s;e conceive there was hardly cau&s;e &s;ufficient for the vivacity of his reproof to our young hero, who&s;e nature certainly was not prone to give offence, nor wanting in humility; in proof of which we take leave to add, that he quietly &s;ubmitted to a long lecture from Doctor Daw upon that very virtue, of which it was plain he had a much greater &s;hare by nature than, his teacher.</P>

<P>DAME May now returned to the cottage, having circulated the happy tidings of her daughter's promotion into every hou&s;e of
<PB N="60" REF="63">
the village, where &s;he could find an acquaint|ance at lei&s;ure to give her the hearing; and as we are never better di&s;po&s;ed to rejoice with others than when we are joyful our&s;elves, &s;o it was with this good woman, who&s;e heart, though naturally apt to &s;ympathize, was at this mo|ment in the be&s;t humour po&s;&s;ible to take a friendly &s;hare in Henry's good fortune: whil&s;t her eyes overflowed with plea&s;ure at the &s;ight of him in his new apparel, her tongue poured forth prai&s;es in abundance, and ble&s;&s;ings with|out &s;tint upon his generous benefactre&s;s.</P>
<P>The ho&s;tile cabal a&s;&s;embled at Blachford's were in the mean time projecting ways and means of revenge; for Lord Crowbery had joined them full fraught with what he called ocular demon&s;tration of his lady's mi&s;conduct; for though he had ob&s;erved a &s;ullen &s;ilence when he met her in the plantation, nothing which there pa&s;&s;ed had e&s;caped his ob&s;erva|tion; and the reader will recollect enough of her &s;ituation to acknowledge it was a very &s;u&s;|picious one: the credit of Jemima's intelli|gence, as reported to him by his friend Blach|ford, was now completely e&s;tabli&s;hed, and his mind prepared for any mea&s;ures of revenge, that could be propo&s;ed to him; but as it was
<PB N="61" REF="64">
his practice in all ca&s;es of danger to keep him|&s;elf out of &s;ight, and put his proxies in the front, his caution did not for&s;ake him upon the meeting with his lady, and he prudently for|bore to wa&s;te any of his noble anger in words, not wi&s;hing either that Mi&s;s Man&s;tock &s;hould witne&s;s them, or that Henry &s;hould be called to an altercation on the &s;pot; whether becau&s;e he deemed him too ignoble for his per&s;onal re&s;entment, or too gallant to &s;ubmit to his in|&s;ult, mu&s;t be left as matter of opinion; we do not wi&s;h to have any corre&s;pondence with his lord&s;hip's private meditations; as to his di&s;|cu&s;&s;ions with Lady Crowbery, he was very in|genious in &s;electing proper times and &s;ea&s;ons for them. The cabal now &s;itting con&s;i&s;ted of Blachford, Captain Crowbery of the marines, and Fulford, an attorney; gentlemen entirely devoted to his lord&s;hip, and the major part at lea&s;t not immoderately prejudiced by the &s;ecret dictates of ju&s;tice, con&s;cience, or honour.</P>
<P>The inmates of the cottage were now col|lected, for Su&s;an had joined the party, but not with the &s;ame joyous &s;pirits that her mother had brought among&s;t them; a &s;ecret melan|choly &s;eemed to weigh upon her heart, and Henry, who well divined the cau&s;e, between
<PB N="62" REF="65">
compa&s;&s;ion for her and alarm for Lady Crow|bery, found ample occupation for his thoughts: as for Ezekiel Daw, the even tenor of his &s;pirits was not apt to be di&s;compo&s;ed either by the fortunate or unfortunate events of this life.</P>
<P>One of the fir&s;t mea&s;ures re&s;olved upon by the cabal, had been to expel the tenants of the cottage from their humble abode; the te|nement belonged to Blachford, and was held at will; &s;o long as he &s;ofter'd any hopes of &s;ucceeding with the daughter, that con&s;iderate gentleman had been a very ea&s;y landlord to the mother; but now that he &s;aw his de&s;igns bla&s;ted, fir&s;t by her attachment to Henry, and &s;econdly, by her engagement with Mi&s;s Man|&s;tock, his charity cooled &s;o fa&s;t, that he com|mi&s;&s;ioned Fulford the attorney not only to warn her mother from the premi&s;&s;es, but al&s;o to en|force payment of certain arrears of rent, which he had ab&s;tained to demand from motives above-mentioned; nay, it was a&s;&s;erted on the part of the poor widow, that as far as any unwitne&s;&s;ed promi&s;e could avail, he had pa&s;&s;ed his word to her for an acquittal of the whole.</P>
<P>Charged with the&s;e in&s;tructions, Fulford
<PB N="63" REF="66">
now pre&s;ented him&s;elf to the party in the cot|tage, and in proper terms of office delivered him&s;elf of his commi&s;&s;ion. Goody May heard the warning, and demand accompanying it, with horror proportioned to the di&s;tre&s;s it menaced her with. The bounty of Lady Crowbery in con&s;ideration of her kindne&s;s to Henry, had ju&s;t enriched her with a &s;um, which this demand &s;o nearly involved, that &s;he felt her&s;elf in imagination even poorer than &s;he was before; her flattering hopes of peace and plenty vani&s;hed like a dream; &s;tript by her deceitful creditor of all her &s;tock of wealth, and thru&s;t out of her cottage, &s;he knew her&s;elf to be excluded in effect from the pari&s;h, where &s;he had long dwelt in the good e&s;teem of the villagers, and by the humble ex|erci&s;e of her art had hitherto contrived to earn a decent maintenance; it was a further aggra|vation to her &s;orrows, that in this di&s;tre&s;s her friend and inmate Ezekiel was to be a &s;harer: &s;he fixed her eyes upon the counte|nance of the attorney, &s;he &s;aw no movements of compa&s;&s;ion there; &s;he then turned them upon her friends a&s;&s;embled around her, &s;he drew no comfort from their looks, threw her&s;elf into a chair and bur&s;t into tears.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="67">Ezekiel &s;eeing this, put him&s;elf between Fulford and the door, towards which he was retreating, and gently laying his hand upon his brea&s;t in the action of &s;topping him, with a &s;teady look and &s;olemn tone, addre&s;&s;ed him in the following words&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Mr. Fulford, you are an attorney; and pity, though not un|known to &s;ome of your profe&s;&s;ion, is certainly no part of your bu&s;ine&s;s here; I &s;hall not therefore trouble you by appealing to what it is evident you do not po&s;&s;e&s;s: whether this poor woman is at this in&s;tant furni&s;h'd with money &s;ufficient to di&s;charge your de|mand, I cannot take upon me to &s;ay; I my|&s;elf have &s;ome little matter in hand, which will be forth coming at her call."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I have enough, and more than enough,"</Q> cried Henry&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Peace, young man,"</Q> replied the preacher, <Q REND="inline">"and interrupt me not: this gentleman's time is too precious to li&s;ten to the modes we &s;hall take for rai&s;ing the &s;um he requires of us, neither is his nature likely to be &s;oftened by any difficulties we are put to in providing it: with your leave, therefore, Mr. Attorney, we &s;hall de&s;ire you will &s;ignify to your principal, that we do not oppo&s;e our&s;elves to the power which the law has given him
<PB N="65" REF="68">
over us, for expelling us from his cottage: tell him we have received his orders, and are preparing to obey them, but &s;ay withal, that they have wrung the tears from the eyes of the widow, and let him prepare him&s;elf to an&s;wer the appeal that is gone up again&s;t him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lookye, Ma&s;ter Daw,"</Q> replied Fulford, <Q REND="inline">"how all that may be is another ca&s;e, and <HI>coram non nobis</HI> as we &s;ay; my commi&s;&s;ion extends no farther than to the widow May; &s;he is the party I am to look to; with re&s;pect to you I have no in&s;tructions, and for aught I know, you may have his wor&s;hip's leave for remaining on the premi&s;&s;es,"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"How &s;ay you, &s;ir?"</Q> exclaimed Ezekiel, <Q REND="inline">"may I have his leave to abandon this poor widow? I will neither take his leave, nor his example, for any thing &s;o ba&s;e and da&s;tardly: he &s;hall never teach me to be cruel like him&s;elf, he &s;hall never &s;educe me to make promi&s;es of pro|tection and afterwards revoke them; I reject his favour, and will per&s;i&s;t in my integrity."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You know your own bu&s;ine&s;s be&s;t,"</Q> quoth Fulford; <Q REND="inline">"I am to look for the rent, or di&s;train to the amount."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Name it,"</Q> cried Henry, <Q REND="inline">"produce your bill, I am prepared
<PB N="66" REF="69">
to di&s;charge it"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">And who are you,"</Q> replied Fulford, <Q REND="inline">"that take upon your&s;elf to &s;peak to a gentleman in &s;o peremptory a &s;tile?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I &s;peak to you,"</Q> &s;aid Henry, <Q REND="inline">"as I &s;hou'd to your principal"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Speak then to my prin|cipal,"</Q> replied the attorney; and turning on his heel, quitted the company.</P>
<P>Before he had gone many paces from the door, I&s;abella, accompanied by her father, en|tered the cottage: Goody May had not yet dried her tears, and the cau&s;e of them being enquired into by her worthy vi&s;itors, gave her an opportunity of relating what had pa&s;&s;ed. Sir Roger Man&s;tock, who&s;e heart was ever open to a ca&s;e of pity, and who well knew the hateful character of Blachford, bade her be comforted, for that he would provide her with a habitation on his own e&s;tate, and in the near neighbourhood of her daughter, where &s;he &s;hould be at lea&s;t as well lodged and better protected than &s;he was at pre&s;ent&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"As for the little matter of rent,"</Q> added he, <Q REND="inline">"which Mr. Blachford thinks fit to exact of you, not|with&s;tanding his word to the contrary, if one of you will &s;tep out and call back the attorney, we will di&s;charge it on the &s;pot."</Q></P>
<P>Henry flew upon the errand, and was at
<PB N="67" REF="70">
Blachford's door in an in&s;tant, where that gen|tleman was then &s;tanding with Fulford at his elbow. At the name of Sir Roger Man&s;tock he &s;tarted, &s;welled with pride and pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;trode away with ha&s;ty &s;teps to the cottage, ordering the attorney to follow him.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Give me leave,"</Q> &s;aid he, as he &s;et his foot within the door, <Q REND="inline">"to tell you, Sir Roger Man|&s;tock, that I do not hold it proper behaviour from one gentleman to another to interfere between me and my tenant, and &s;pirit her out of my hou&s;e for the invidious purpo&s;e of ca&s;t|ing an odium upon my character, as if I was a tyrant and per&s;ecutor of the poor: I would have the world to know that I have as much humanity as your&s;elf or any man breathing, and I don't &s;ee what right you have to take for granted that I intend to go the length of driv|ing this woman out of her hou&s;e at any rate."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mr. Blachford,"</Q> replied the venerable baronet, <Q REND="inline">"you have put an interpretation upon my motives &s;o contrary to what has ever go|verned my actions, that I &s;hould be warranted in making no reply to your invectives; but I am an old man pretty well known in this neighbourhood, and little afraid of being mi&s;|under&s;tood by any body but your&s;elf.

<P>Blachford's du&s;ky vi&s;age turned purple with rage, he gnawed his lip, knit his &s;ooty brows, and &s;ullenly replied, <Q REND="inline">"It is no concern of mine how many vagabonds you take into your hou&s;e, &s;o mine is clear of them."</Q>&mdash;Upon the in&s;tant &s;tept forward our young hero, and darting a look like that which our immortal bard be&s;tows upon the &s;eraph Abdiel before he encounters the grand apo&s;tate.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Now,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"your virulence &s;o clearly points at me, that I am warranted to reply to you; and fir&s;t, I tell you, I will not permit you to lo&s;e the re&s;pect due to a venerable character, which none but one devoid of every manly, every virtuous feeling, would have the ba&s;ene&s;s to defame: in the next place, I have a word for you in an&s;wer to the a&s;per&s;ions you have thrown out again&s;t this innocent young wo|man,

<P>When Henry entered the cottage, he found the women anxiou&s;ly employed in bringing I&s;abella out of a &s;woon.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Heaven defend me,"</Q> he exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"what is the matter?"</Q> Dame May had dropt &s;ome hart&s;horn into water; Henry, &s;carce knowing what he did, &s;eized the cup, and pre&s;ented it to the lips of the drooping beauty; at that moment &s;he opened her eyes&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"And are you &s;afe?"</Q> &s;he &s;aid, then took the contents of the cup, and pre&s;ently revived.</P>
<P>In a few minutes I&s;abella was perfectly re|covered, and then Sir Roger Man&s;tock began to expre&s;s him&s;elf in the kinde&s;t terms to
<PB N="71" REF="74">
Henry: he required to know what had pa&s;&s;ed between him and Blachford; exhorted him very earne&s;tly not to enter into any quarrel with a man of &s;o malicious a character, and very cordially invited him to take refuge in Man&s;tock-hou&s;e&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"For I am per&s;uaded,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"that both Blachford, and, I am &s;orry to add, Lord Crowbery him&s;elf, will &s;et every engine at work to play off &s;ome diabolical plot upon you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Indeed, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid I&s;abella, turning her eyes upon him with the tendere&s;t expre&s;&s;ion, <Q REND="inline">"you are in the greate&s;t danger whil&s;t you re|main among&s;t them; my dear father gives you the be&s;t coun&s;el, and you will do well to get out of their way; for only think what afflic|tion it would give to my poor cou&s;in, if any harm was to befall you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"She is infinitely good,"</Q> replied Henry, <Q REND="inline">"and her &s;olicitude gives &s;ome value to a life, which, circum&s;tanced as it was a while ago, would &s;carce have merited my care."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"If that be &s;o,"</Q> re&s;umed I&s;abella, <Q REND="inline">"I am confident it is her wi&s;h that you &s;hould accept my fa|ther's invitation; and, after what I have now been a witne&s;s to, permit me to &s;ay, it is mine al&s;o."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"You honour me too much,"</Q> replied
<PB N="72" REF="75">
he, <Q REND="inline">"and I can make no other return to &s;uch unmerited kindne&s;s, than by a&s;&s;uring Sir Roger Man&s;tock and your&s;elf of my unalterable re|&s;pect and gratitude."</Q></P>
<P>This point being &s;o &s;ettled, the worthy ba|ronet and his fair daughter took their leave of the good people, Sir Roger having &s;haken Henry very cordially by the hand, and a&s;&s;ured him of a hearty welcome at Man&s;tock-hou&s;e. Upon their arrival at the ca&s;tle, they found Lady Crowbery alone, and employed at her writing-table; their carriage was at the door, and they had called to bid her farewell. Sir Roger related to her all that had been pa&s;&s;ing at the cottage, and &s;aid &s;o many hand&s;ome things of Henry, both with re&s;pect to his be|haviour, per&s;on and &s;pirit, that whil&s;t her heart trembled for his &s;afety, it overflowed with joy upon hearing him &s;o prai&s;ed.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"And now,"</Q> &s;aid the baronet, <Q REND="inline">"we mu&s;t think of &s;omething for him out of hand, for there is a deal of malice brewing again&s;t him in the hearts of this Blachford and his crew: he has a gallant &s;pirit; I think his turn &s;eems to lie to|wards the army."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is too clear,"</Q> replied Lady Crowbery, <Q REND="inline">"what dangers be&s;et him, and with whom they
<PB N="73" REF="76">
&s;pring: that I &s;hall have my &s;hare in them, I can well believe; I expect no le&s;s, and am preparing my&s;elf to meet it. In the mean time, to remove him to &s;ome place of &s;afety &s;eems the fir&s;t thing needful; of his future de&s;|tination we may decide at lei&s;ure."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"But my father,"</Q> cried I&s;abella, <Q REND="inline">"has invited him, and he is coming to Man&s;tock-hou&s;e."</Q>&mdash;Lady Crowbery &s;miled; but whether it was from the joy &s;he took in the intelligence, or from &s;ome|thing &s;he ob&s;erved in the eagerne&s;s of I&s;abella's manner, or from a mixture of cau&s;es, we mu&s;t leave to conjecture; certain it is, that the fine&s;t eyes in nature were ju&s;t then illuminated with uncommon vivacity, and the &s;weete&s;t counte|nance over&s;pread with a blu&s;h, who&s;e exqui&s;ite carnation no art can imitate.</P>
<P>After a few minutes &s;pent in making their affectionate adieus, they parted; Sir Roger Man&s;tock and his fair daughter to their own home, and Lady Crowbery re&s;umed her pen; the productions of which, it is more than pro|bable, our readers will hereafter be acquainted with.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now look back to the cottage, where the agitation, in which we left our friends, had not yet &s;ub&s;ided. Ezekiel was
<PB N="74" REF="77">
gone forth upon the Green, and being there joined by &s;everal of his neighbours, with whom he was in general favour, had been giving them a valedictory harangue, with &s;ome occa&s;ional comments upon Ju&s;tice Blachford's inhuma|nity to the widow; that good woman, in the mean while, who had not the fault of keeping an idle tongue, was no le&s;s bu&s;y in a different quarter; and perhaps there was not a corner in the pari&s;h where &s;he was not beloved and the Ju&s;tice abhorred, &s;o that all voices were loud in her cau&s;e; even John Jenkins, a fel|low of notorious levity, and the ob&s;treperous cow-boy, his brother, were on the &s;ide of the &s;ufferers, and joined in the cry again&s;t their village-tyrant with the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Henry and Su&s;an alone kept hou&s;e; he pon|dering on a variety of intere&s;ting matters, &s;he probably on only one object, and that before her eyes. Opportunities like the pre&s;ent &s;he had little pro&s;pect of in future; her heart flut|tered, her &s;pirits wavered betwixt hope and de&s;pair: &s;he &s;ighed, and gently re&s;ting her arm upon his &s;houlder, <Q REND="inline">"Alas! for me,"</Q> &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline">"my happy hours have been but few, and they are pa&s;t: You'll think no more of me when this fine lady occupies your heart: I &s;ee it com|ing
<PB N="75" REF="78">
on, I &s;ee it plainly."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Impo&s;&s;ible!"</Q> he re|plied, <Q REND="inline">"my thoughts are otherwi&s;e employ'd; they never can a&s;pire &s;o high."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Ah, Hen|ry!"</Q> re&s;umed &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"this is but feign'd humi|lity; you've &s;een enough to know that I am right: You and I &s;hall take no more &s;uch walks together as we have done; you will have a fairer companion in your rambles through the groves at Man&s;tock; and let me own 'tis fit you &s;hou'd; I am not worthy of you; you are in all re&s;pects above me, and it was only in your di&s;tre&s;s'd and humble &s;tate that I a&s;pir'd to think of you, to con&s;ort with you, and to love you: If I have been too forward, and offended you, do not remember me with contempt, but pardon a fond girl that can never cea&s;e to bear you a devoted faithful heart."</Q></P>
<P>Su&s;an never looked &s;o lovely in the eyes of Henry as at this moment: the melancholy tone in which the&s;e words were uttered, the mode&s;t air accompanying their delivery, her &s;ighs, her tears, her blu&s;hes, touched him more &s;en&s;ibly than all the playful &s;miles that in her gayer moments &s;he had glanced upon him. Every thing that his compa&s;&s;ionate nature could &s;ug|ge&s;t to con&s;ole and &s;oothe her he &s;aid and did without re&s;erve, for every pa&s;&s;ion &s;eemed now
<PB N="76" REF="79">
buried in affliction; and as for &s;uch care&s;&s;es as honour might allow of, he deemed it cruelty to withhold them.&mdash;But here let me in&s;ert one caution to my youthful readers how they &s;ur|render them&s;elves to the indulgence of that dangerous propen&s;ity called pity, which, if it is not love it&s;elf, is yet &s;o clo&s;ely allied to it, that wherever the intere&s;ts of the one can be &s;erved, there is no &s;afety in committing your&s;elves to the other. Of the truth of this remark our in|experienced Henry may &s;erve for an example; &s;educed by pure compa&s;&s;ion into the office of a comforter, he found him&s;elf &s;urprized into emotions, which it required the &s;tronge&s;t re&s;o|lution to controul; and &s;o gentle was the cur|rent, &s;o plea&s;ingly deceitful the gradations by which he was carried on towards that gulph, where honour would have been lo&s;t, that had not the recollection of his late reproach to Blachford timely warned his con&s;cience to avoid the guilt which he condemned in another, he had here been overthrown, and we mu&s;t have devoted one unwilling page to the la|mented record of his &s;hame; for opportu|nity courted him, beauty &s;miled upon him, love allured, and Su&s;an whi&s;pered an in|viting challenge in his ear, that fairly &s;et all prudence at defiance; in &s;hort, malicious For|tune
<PB N="77" REF="80">
&s;eemed to have trepanned him into a &s;itua|tion with this tempting girl, exactly of a piece with their's, to who&s;e incontinence he owed his birth.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Then I mu&s;t marry you,"</Q> was his apology to Su&s;an's ra&s;h propo&s;al.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I a&s;k no &s;uch &s;a|crifice,"</Q> replied the dam&s;el.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"This ho&s;pitable roof will fall upon my head."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Away with all &s;uch &s;cruples,"</Q> &s;he again replied, and pre&s;s'd him in her arms.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"'Tis a hard &s;truggle!"</Q> he exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"but, by the Power that guards me, I will never be a Blachford!"</Q>&mdash;With the&s;e words he &s;prung from her embrace: the &s;nares of love, that had &s;o nearly clo&s;ed upon him, gave way, and bur&s;t at once; the vanqui&s;hed pa&s;&s;ions fled, and Virtue put her wreath of triumph on his brow!</P>
<P>A momentary glance of anger darted from the eyes of Su&s;an, as &s;he exclaimed,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Hea|vens! can you u&s;e me thus?"</Q>&mdash;But it was only a glance; re&s;entment had no la&s;ting tenure in her brea&s;t; her heart, though liable to be &s;ur|prized by love, was not &s;urrendered to di&s;ho|nour: She rallied her di&s;ordered thoughts, looked back upon the pa&s;t with con&s;cious &s;elf-reproach for her own de&s;peration, and, covered with confu&s;ion, hid her face.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IX. A Funeral Oration out of Place.</HEAD>
<P>IN the council, that &s;ate upon the fate of Henry, there were as many opinions as there were members: Fulford, who looked for no re&s;ources but what were to be found in his own profe&s;&s;ion, recommended the eject|ment; and of this we have already &s;een the re|&s;ult, which certainly was not very flattering to the projector.</P>
<P>Captain Crowbery, who&s;e ideas, like tho&s;e of Fulford, were of the profe&s;&s;ional &s;ort, was for bolder mea&s;ures, and undertook, through his intere&s;t with a friend, who commanded a pre&s;s|gang then upon the coa&s;t, to take our hero off, unknown to all his friends, and &s;hip him in a tender: This propo&s;al, which did not interfere with the legal proceeding before mentioned, nor involve any one of the junto either in diffi|culties or dangers, was univer&s;ally approved of, and had in fact every merit that a revengeful plot could boa&s;t of: It was therefore re&s;olved, <HI>nem. con.</HI> that the Captain &s;hould &s;et forth in &s;earch of his friend, and concert the means of carrying it into execution &s;ecretly and &s;ecurely;
<PB N="79" REF="82">
Lord Crowbery enjoying by anticipation, the agonies of his Lady when her favourite &s;hould di&s;appear on a &s;udden, and no one could ac|count for it.</P>
<P>But Blachford, who&s;e nature, though by no means brave, was bloody and revengeful, and who&s;e pride was &s;tung to the quick by the &s;pi|rited retort which Henry had ca&s;t in his teeth, had an underplot of his own, which, for good rea&s;ons, he withheld from his a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, con&s;cious that it would neither tally with the legal no|tions of the attorney, nor probably &s;uit the more martial &s;pirit of the Captain; nay, he had his doubts if even my Lord would be fond of giving countenance to it; for it was neither more nor le&s;s than to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate Henry, or, in the vulgar phra&s;e, knock him down in the dark, and leave him to his chance for life or death when he had done with him.</P>
<P>Blachford in his chair of ju&s;tice could expa|tiate, as we have &s;een, with all due &s;olemnity upon the heinous crime of murder; but Blach|ford in his private character was the very man in the world to project the perpetration, though not ju&s;t the per&s;on to undertake the hazard of executing &s;uch an act: He was pro|vided with a confidential &s;ervant, whom Na|ture
<PB N="80" REF="83">
&s;eemed to have qualified for the&s;e pur|po&s;es with the mo&s;t ab&s;olute in&s;en&s;ibility both of danger and humanity. This adroit per&s;onage, by name Lawrence O'Rourke, who&s;e origin was to be &s;ought in the we&s;t of Connaught, had been taken into Blachford's &s;ervice, when he fir&s;t commenced planter in Jamaica; and &s;o faithfully had he mini&s;tered to the cruelties of his ma&s;ter, that it was generally thought mo&s;t of the memorable acts were done by his hands, for which that gentleman became di&s;tingui&s;hed in tho&s;e parts by the title of Bloody Bob Blach|ford.</P>
<P>The moon was at this time commodiou&s;ly in her la&s;t quarter: Lord Crowbery had &s;ignified his intention of &s;ummoning Henry to the ca&s;|tle that evening, and it occurred to Blachford that the opportunity was favourable for way-laying him on his return through the grove, where Larry O'Rourke undertook to po&s;t him&s;elf, armed with a &s;tout bludgeon, in the u&s;e and exerci&s;e of which he was very expert.</P>
<P>In the mean time Ezekiel and Goody May, having in their different quarters di&s;&s;eminated the &s;tory of Blachford's employing his attorney to eject them from their cottage, through the whole village, the indignation became general,
<PB N="81" REF="84">
and &s;ome of the younger people began to em|ploy them&s;elves in the making and erecting of a very &s;tately gibbet in the centre of the Green, and in full view from the windows of his wor|&s;hip's man&s;ion, for the purpo&s;e of executing that venerable magi&s;trate by proxy on the &s;pot. This proxy, which was a very rea&s;on|able likene&s;s of it's principal, was &s;eated in a tumbril, with it's arms tied behind it in a very orthodox manner, and &s;eemed only to wait the prayers of &s;ome charitable per&s;on, before it re|ceived the word of command for being hoi&s;ted up to the place of it's execution. In this aw|ful interim it occurred to the ingenious pro|jectors of this moral machinery, that if Doctor Daw could be prevailed upon to give it his pa&s;sport to the other world, they might launch it off with becoming grace, and the &s;pectators be edified by the cata&s;trophe.</P>
<P>It was in the du&s;k of the evening, and Eze|kiel had ju&s;t knocked the a&s;hes out of his la&s;t pipe, when the noi&s;e and hubbub on the Green called him forth. No &s;ooner had the figure in the tumbril cro&s;&s;ed his optic nerves in the ob|&s;curity of the twilight, than tho&s;e afore&s;aid nerves &s;ugge&s;ted to his &s;en&s;orium an idea, that the enraged mob were actually about to execute
<PB N="82" REF="85">
a living man without judge or jury. Horror-&s;truck at the &s;ight, he ru&s;hed among&s;t them, vociferating by the way, <Q REND="inline">"For the Lord's &s;ake, neighbours! what are you about? Are you mad? Are you going to commit murder?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"No, no,"</Q> cried one of the throng, <Q REND="inline">"we are only gibbetting the Squire for turning you and Goody May out of doors."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Od's my life!"</Q> cried Ezekiel, coming nearer to the figure, and di&s;covering &s;omething like a human face, with an enormous pair of black eyebrows, <Q REND="inline">"I prote&s;t to truth it did deceive me: Never tru&s;t me if it is not a &s;triking likene&s;s of that unworthy per&s;on who has turned the widow from his door, and a&s;&s;ailed the cha&s;|tity of her daughter: would to Heaven the original were as harmle&s;s as the copy!

Have you eyes, ye lookers-on, and can you &s;ee the fate of this unholy one without trembling? Have you ears, and can you hear me and not

Let him that coveteth his neighbour's daughter take warning by this wretch's fate! What is the lu&s;t of the eye? a &s;nare: What the evil motion of the heart? a &s;erpent in your bo&s;om: What the war of the members provoking to uncleanne&s;s? a ramp|ing and a roaring lion. Maidens! (if there be any here that an&s;wer to that name) remem|ber that the cha&s;tity of a dam&s;el is like the dew-drop on the flower; the &s;un &s;hineth wantonly upon it, and it is gone: Keep your&s;elves in the &s;hade; let your concealment be your &s;afe|guard, ye are then only &s;ecure when no one can approach you: Handle not the a&s;p, for it will &s;ting you; put not your hand to the cocka|trice's ne&s;t, for there is poi&s;on in the tooth of it, and it hath the bite of mortal death."</Q></P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e words were upon his lips, Eze|kiel, to his utter a&s;toni&s;hment, beheld the fi|gure &s;lowly a&s;cend out of the cart; and by the operation of a rope and pulley (of neither of which, good man! he had taken any account, being then warmly engaged with the cocka|trice) mount into the air, &s;u&s;pended by the neck from the cro&s;s-bar of the gibbet. He ca&s;t

his eyes upwards with pity and amaze, and pi|ou&s;ly ejaculated, in the charity of his heart,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"The Lord have mercy upon thy &s;oul!"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Amen!"</Q> echoed John Jenkins, who per|formed the office of hangman, and at the &s;ame time run the vice-ju&s;tice up by the pulley. John was the idle&s;t fellow in the pari&s;h, and mo&s;t in the ill graces of Doctor Daw, for the loo&s;ene&s;s of his morals.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Here he goes to the devil in a whiff,"</Q> quoth Jenkins.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Art thou &s;o familiar with the devil,"</Q> &s;aid Ezekiel, <Q REND="inline">"as to know whom he will take, and whom he will &s;pare? Have a care of one, John Jen|kins, and do not venture to pronounce upon thy neighbours."</Q>&mdash;John was too bu&s;y to enter into argument, &s;o Ezekiel had the la&s;t word, and turned a&s;ide towards the cottage.</P>
<P>The mob, under the conduct of General Jenkins, the hangman, marched in array to Dame May's cottage, and having drawn up be|fore the door, Jenkins being deputed as &s;poke&s;|man, announced him&s;elf, and was admitted.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"By your leave, Dame May,"</Q> quoth the ora|tor, <Q REND="inline">"we mean you no offence; but being, as you do &s;ee, your friends and neighbours, we come to cheer you a bit in your affliction, by telling you, for your comfort, we have gib|betted

the Ju&s;tice upon the Green; and if we had treated him as &s;uch a hard-hearted fellow de&s;erves, we &s;hou'd have pull'd his hou&s;e &s;tick and &s;tone down to the ground; &s;o there's the right o' the matter.

<P><Q REND="inline">"I hope &s;o too,"</Q> quoth Ezekiel, in an un|der-tone. Dame May returned her thanks; Henry &s;hook the orator by the hand, and the mob, according to cu&s;tom, adjourned to the alehou&s;e.</P>

<P>THE news of the gibbetting flew to Blach|ford's ears by one of the nimble&s;t couriers Fame had in her &s;ervice; it made him furious, and as he laid it all to Henry's account, it

rendered him as hungry for his prey as a hyaena.</P>
<P>The haughty Peer now &s;eated in his ca&s;tle, and encompa&s;&s;ed by his myrmidons, di&s;|patched a &s;ervant with his &s;ummons for Henry to attend upon him: What particular purpo&s;e he meant to effect by this, does not clearly appear, but it is not unlikely Blachford was the mover of it, with the view of wreaking his vengeance upon the youth by the hands of O'Rourke, on his return from the conference.</P>
<P>The me&s;&s;enger being di&s;patched for Henry, order was given by the Peer, that his lady &s;hould come to him: Blachford and the attorney thereupon took the hint to retire, and her Lady&s;hip, having obeyed the call, was welcomed in manner following&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"So Madam, you are come; be pleas'd to take your &s;eat, I have &s;omething to &s;ay to you.

<HEAD>CHAPTER XI. A Blow well placed in the Dark, or, in other Words, according to the Greek Proverb, Blach|ford &s;hears a Lion.</HEAD>
<P>AS Henry pa&s;&s;ed through the hall, after his conference related in the foregoing chap|ter, he was met by Lady Crowbery, who ha&s;tily put a paquet into his hand, con|juring him to take care of it, and keep &s;ecret the contents.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"In that paper,"</Q> &s;he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"you will &s;ee the my&s;tery of your birth re|veal'd: Betake your&s;elf to my uncle Man&s;tock without delay, and Heaven in its mercy pro|tect and guard you!"</Q></P>
<P>Henry, almo&s;t overpowered with joyful &s;ur|prize, at hearing what that paper was to di&s;|clo&s;e, took it with all the rapture and devotion, which its intere&s;ting contents excited, and carefully &s;ecured it in his pocket. He had yet &s;ufficient recollection left to &s;eize the oppor|nity for returning the ring to Lady Crowbery wrapped up in paper and tied; at the &s;ame
<PB N="97" REF="100">
time he briefly recited what had been &s;aid to him by the man who found it: Lady Crow|bery &s;eemed a good deal &s;urprized, and denied having mi&s;&s;ed any one of her rings, however as the time was pre&s;&s;ing, and the danger of being di&s;covered in&s;tant, &s;he took it from him, and again bidding him tenderly farewell, ha&s;tened away.</P>
<P>There were two roads to the village; the &s;horte&s;t by a foot-path through the plantation, which was clo&s;e and now dark, the other was the common coach-road through the park, open and &s;ecure from ambu&s;cade. As Henry came out from the hall-door, he found old Weevil the miller waiting in the court-yard: he had been to the hou&s;e with flour, and had been chatting as u&s;ual with the &s;ervants; he under&s;tood from them, that Henry was under examination with my lord, and having noticed O'Rourke prowling about the plantations with, his bludgeon in his hand, entertained &s;ome &s;u&s;picions of a plot upon Henry, and was de|termined to accompany him home, and per|&s;uaded him to take the open road through the park.</P>
<P>This was a ta&s;k of &s;ome difficulty on the part of the friendly miller, for Henry's eager|ne&s;s
<PB N="98" REF="101">
to open the important pacquet made him very adver&s;e to any propo&s;al that prolonged the time; the point, however, was carried, and he, accompanied by Weevil, arrived &s;afe at the widow's, whil&s;t Larry O'Rourke laid clo&s;e in his ambu&s;h at the bottom of the grove, where was a little foot-bridge that led over a narrow &s;tream, thickly &s;haded with alders.</P>
<P>When a much longer period of time had elap&s;ed than would have &s;erved to carry Henry through the grove, Blachford, who calculated minutes, with &s;ome anxiety, &s;et out from the Vi&s;counts upon the &s;cout, and took his way &s;ecretly and &s;olitarily down the plantation-walk: as he approached the &s;pot where the attack was to be made, he &s;topt and li&s;tened; all was &s;ilence: he took coun&s;el with his own thoughts, and concluding the bu&s;ine&s;s was done, advanced, nothing doubting, till he had one foot upon the bridge, when, as if fortune had in that in&s;tant recovered her eye-&s;ight and be&s;towed the bludgeon with &s;trict reta|liation upon its proper owner, Larry O'Rourke, &s;uppo&s;ing he had now made &s;ure of his victim, took aim with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, and dealt his blow with &s;o hearty a good-will upon the pericranium
<PB N="99" REF="102">
of the magi&s;trate, that Blachford, having ut|tered one horrid yell as his heels flew from under him, in&s;tantly paid his compliments to the muddy naiads of the brook.</P>
<P>The George and Dragon alehou&s;e, where the party was carou&s;ing, who had performed the ceremony of the gibbet, was &s;o near to the &s;cene of action, that Blachford's yell was mo&s;t di&s;tinctly heard by the per&s;ons there a&s;|&s;embled, who immediately turned out upon the alarm. Among&s;t the fir&s;t of the&s;e was John Jenkins the hangman, who found Larry O'Rourke employed in dragging the ju&s;tice out of the water, for he had now, though &s;omewhat of the late&s;t, di&s;covered a &s;mall mi&s;take as to heads, but in point of execution no fault could be found with his work, which &s;eemed to be effectually done, as the blow had taken place ju&s;t above the temple, and the bludgeon was loaded with lead. John Jenkins being &s;omewhat more than elevated with his evening's fe&s;tivity, was for leaving the ju&s;tice to his fate, making u&s;e of the trite proverb, that the man who was born to be hanged, was in no danger of being drowned; but the &s;oberer part of the company, who
<PB N="100" REF="103">
&s;aw further into the ca&s;e than John did, lent their hands to the work, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in dragging Blachford out of the brook, who during the whole operation ob&s;erved a perfect &s;ilence, which we are far from imputing to any &s;ullenne&s;s on the part of that gentleman, he being at that time from home upon a tem|porary trip to the regions of in&s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>One of the company had been di&s;patched for a candle and lantern, and by the light of this the body of Ju&s;tice Blachford, &s;tretched upon the ground and motionle&s;s, exhibited a mo&s;t gha&s;tly &s;pectacle; his temple &s;treaming with blood, his eyes fixed, and no &s;ymptom of life appearing. Upon the &s;ight of this, Larry O'Rourke &s;et up a mo&s;t dolorous howl in the true Connaught key and cadence, crying out.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Ullaloo! Ma&s;ter, why wou'd you die? Had'nt you hor&s;es and cows and cattle in abundance, with plenty of &s;trong drink in your vaults, and &s;tore of money in your lockers, and why wou'd you leave poor Larry to lament and cry over you at &s;uch a rate, when you might have been ea&s;y and quiet at home, and no harm done? Ah! was'nt it a foul &s;tep of your's to thru&s;t your head in the
<PB N="101" REF="104">
way of my cudgel, when you knew well enough, aye and wou'd witne&s;s it too, if the grace of God was'nt ju&s;t now out of your memory, that if every one had his own, that big knock on the head you have got is another man's property, only he chanc'd to be out of the way when I gave it to him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Seize the murderer,"</Q> cried one of the troop, upon which John Jenkins and the re&s;t laid hold of him.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"What is it you are upon, ye pagans,"</Q> exclaimed Larry, <Q REND="inline">"to be &s;eizing me? Let the dead man &s;peak for him&s;elf, and mark if he don't tell you another &s;tory about the matter, whereby it was no murder, only a &s;mall mi&s;take, and if that's a hanging matter, woe be&s;ide my countrymen! A&s;k him now, ye &s;parrow-hawks, if it was'nt at his own de&s;ire that I kill'd him, and how &s;hou'd I know one man from another in the dark, when I cou'd &s;ee neither?"</Q></P>
<P>Somebody now cried out to hold him fa&s;t, for it was confe&s;&s;edly a plot between ma&s;ter and man to have a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated Henry.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"To be &s;ure it was,"</Q> &s;aid O'Rourke; <Q REND="inline">"Do you think I'm &s;uch a gracele&s;s teif as to kill my own ma&s;ter?

<P><PB N="102" REF="105">Three or four of them now began to hale the Iri&s;hman away with them, whil&s;t others fetched a blanket from the alehou&s;e, on which they laid the body of Blachford, and in this manner carried him to his own hou&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER I. A &s;hort Treati&s;e upon Love, antient and modern.</HEAD>
<P>LOVE, as a deity, was inve&s;ted, by tho&s;e who made him &s;uch, with the mo&s;t con|tradictory attributes: they feigned him blind, yet called him an unerring mark&s;man; gave him wings, yet allowed that con&s;tancy was his be&s;t qualification; de&s;cribed him as an infant, yet were not to learn that infancy alone is exempted from his power.</P>
<P>The&s;e are contrarieties, which none but the initiated can reconcile. They ju&s;tify his blind|ne&s;s, when hurried on by the impetuo&s;ity of pa&s;&s;ion they e&s;py no danger in the precipice before them; they acknowledge he is &s;wift of wing, when the minutes they devote to his en|joyments fly &s;o quickly, and they cannot but regard him as an infant, when one &s;hort honey|moon begins and terminates his date of life.</P>
<P>A thou&s;and ingenious devices have been formed to &s;uit the various properties of this fa|bulous
<PB N="104" REF="107">
divinity, and every &s;ymbol has it's moral; he has been allegorized and enigmatized in in|numerable ways; the pen, the pencil and the chi&s;&s;el have been worn out in his &s;ervice; floods of ink, looms of canva&s;s, and quarries of marble, have been exhau&s;ted in the boundle&s;s field of figurative de&s;cription. The lover, who finds out &s;o many ways of torturing him&s;elf, cannot fail to &s;trike out &s;ymbols and devices to expre&s;s the pa&s;&s;ion under which he &s;uffers; then the ver&s;e flows mournfully elegiac, and the bleed|ing heart, transfixed with an arrow, is emble|matically di&s;played; thus, whil&s;t the poet va|ries his mea&s;ure, the painter and the &s;culptor vary their devices, as joy or &s;orrow, &s;ucce&s;s or di&s;appointment, influence their fancy. One man's Cupid is &s;et a&s;tride upon a lion, to ex|emplify his power; another places his upon a crocodile, to &s;atyrize his hypocri&s;y; here the god is made to trample upon kingly crowns, there to trifle with a wanton &s;parrow; the adaman|tine rock now crumbles at his &s;troke, anon we &s;ee him ba&s;king on the bo&s;om of Chloe, his arrows broken and his pinions bound.</P>
<P>The Greeks, who had more caprice in their pa&s;&s;ions than either nature or morality can excu&s;e, neverthele&s;s bequeathed their <HI>Cupid</HI> to
<PB N="105" REF="108">
po&s;terity with a con&s;iderable &s;tock in hand; but the moderns added more from funds of their own, and every thing they be&s;towed was hone&s;tly appropriated to the only &s;ex that has any claim upon the regular and &s;olid firme of <HI>Venus, Cupid,</HI> and <HI>Co.</HI></P>
<P>When &s;uper&s;tition met its final overthrow, and the heathen temples were di&s;mantled of their images and altars, Love alone, the younge&s;t of the deities, &s;urvived the di&s;a&s;ter, and &s;till holds his dignities and prerogatives by chri&s;tian courte&s;y; and though modern in|genuity has not added much to his embelli&s;h|ments, yet, in the ardour and &s;incerity of our devotion, we do not yield to the antients: the whole region of romance has been made over to him; our drama, tragic as well as comic, has gone far beyond that of the antients in building its fable and character upon the pa&s;|&s;ion of love. La&s;t in point of time, but not of allegiance, comes the fraternity of noveli&s;ts, who are his clients to a man; Love is the e&s;|&s;ence of every tale, and &s;o &s;tudious are our authors not to let the &s;pirit of that e&s;&s;ence be|come vapid, that few, if any, fail to conclude with the event of marriage: connubial love is of a quality too tame for their purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="109">As the majority of our novels are formed upon dome&s;tic plots, and mo&s;t of the&s;e drawn from the very times in which they are written, the living manners mu&s;t be charactered by the authors of &s;uch fables, and we mu&s;t of cour&s;e make our Love of &s;uch materials as the fa|&s;hion of the age affords: it will not therefore re&s;emble the high-flown pa&s;&s;ion of the Gothic knights and heroes of the old romance, neither will it partake of tho&s;e coar&s;e manners and expre&s;&s;ions, which our old comic writers adopt; it will even take a different &s;hade from what a noveli&s;t would have given it half a cen|tury ago, for the &s;ocial commerce of the &s;exes is now &s;o very different from what it was then, that beauty is no longer wor&s;hipped with that di&s;|tant re&s;pect, which our antiquated beaux paid to their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>As the modern fine gentleman &s;tudies no|thing but his ea&s;e, and aims only to be what he terms <HI>comfortable,</HI> regarding all tho&s;e things, that u&s;ed to be con&s;idered as annoyances and embarra&s;&s;ments, with cool indifference and contempt, even Love in him is not an active pa&s;&s;ion; he expre&s;&s;es no raptures at the &s;ight of beauty, and if he is haply provoked to &s;ome &s;light exertion out of cour&s;e, it mu&s;t be &s;ome

<HEAD>CHAPTER II. A Letter &s;pares a Blu&s;h.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Henry entered the cottage, and found it cleared of it's inhabitants, who had joined the crowd that was collected about the wounded body of the ju&s;tice, his heart pal|pitated with eager, yet anxious, curio&s;ity, as he unfolded the intere&s;ting pacquet which Lady Crowbery had given him, and therein read as follows:</P>
<Q><P>Nature forces from me the important &s;e|cret; my heart can no longer &s;uppre&s;s it's &s;truggles: I am your mother. A victim to love, before rea&s;on or experience had armed me again&s;t that dangerous pa&s;&s;ion, I yielded to a fatal propo&s;al of e&s;caping with my lover to Scotland from my father, who inexorably oppo&s;ed our marriage. Made de&s;perate by that cruel interdiction, we &s;et

out upon our ra&s;h adventure; were clo&s;ely pur&s;ued, and, in the la&s;t &s;tage of our jour|ney, overtaken. When we found our&s;elves cut off from any further progre&s;s, de&s;pair &s;eized us, but it was the de&s;pair of lovers, re&s;olute to &s;acrifice every thing rather than their fidelity and plighted faith.</P>
<P>In this forlorn and hopele&s;s moment, love, importunity, the interchange of mu|tual vows and promi&s;es, and, above all, the vi&s;ionary hope that &s;o we might compel my father to unite us, tempted us to &s;eal our contract without the ceremony that was needful to confirm and &s;anctify it.</P>
<P>I own the ra&s;hne&s;s of the deed, nor aim to palliate it's culpability; I pro&s;trated my&s;elf at my father's feet, confe&s;&s;ed my weakne&s;s, implored his pity and forgivene&s;s, and, in an agony of grief, be&s;ought him to con&s;ent to join our hands, and &s;ave me from the &s;hame and mi&s;ery that would el&s;e befall me. 'Twas in vain; we were torn a&s;under; a noble youth, unexceptionable in birth and character, the younger &s;on of the Lord Pendennis, was di&s;carded; he went upon his adventures to India; I remained di&s;con&s;o|late, and in ignorance of his fate, till in the

<P>The my&s;tery thus revealed, Henry awhile &s;tood fixt in dumb &s;urprize; the fir&s;t emotions of his heart bur&s;t into unpremeditated prayer and pious thanks to God. Cla&s;ping the paper in his hands, with bended knees and eyes up|lifted, in the fervour of his &s;oul, he broke forth&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I thank thee, Father of all mercies, that thou ha&s;t now vouch&s;afed to take thy humble creature out of darkne&s;s into light, conducting me through various chances by thy all-gracious providence, and giving me at length to know what nature langui&s;hed for in vain, the my&s;tery of my birth.

<P>A Few minutes only had pa&s;&s;ed, whil&s;t Henry was endeavouring to compo&s;e his agitated &s;pirits, when behold! Ezekiel, fol|lowed by the women, returned to the cottage, full fraught with texts of holy writ applicable to the &s;cene he had been pre&s;ent at, and which he was &s;o impatient to di&s;charge, that how to find room for them all, and what order to bring them out in, &s;eemed to be the only thing that puzzled him; and though the hour was drawing towards bed-time, preach he mu&s;t, and Henry mu&s;t hear him, though any other per&s;on but Ezekiel could not have failed to notice the di&s;traction of his thoughts; but times and &s;ea&s;ons never were a part of that good man's &s;tudies, neither was he one who thought there could be too much of a good thing; and the be&s;t of all po&s;&s;ible things, in his opinion, was his own preaching.</P>

<P>This was one of the la&s;t &s;ubjects Zachary wi&s;hed to talk upon, yet &s;o it happened, that Ezekiel &s;eldom failed to &s;tart it in his com|pany; to turn it off therefore for the pre&s;ent, Zachary ob&s;erved, that death to be &s;ure was a &s;erious thing to every man, but that was no rea&s;on we &s;hould be always talking about it; 'twou'd come &s;oon enough of its own accord: <Q REND="inline">"For my part,"</Q> continued he, <Q REND="inline">"I hold it good to keep up the &s;pirits of my patients, and do my be&s;t to drive &s;uch gloomy thoughts away from them; whereas, whenever one of your &s;ort comes about them preaching and praying, I con&s;tantly ob&s;erve they &s;ink and pine away, the pul&s;e grows low and feeble; tremors &s;eize them, and &s;ymptoms, which be|fore were only menacing, thenceforward be|come mortal: therefore do you &s;ee, friend Daw, you and I directly counteract each other,

<P>Zachary concluded in time, for Ezekiel's tongue wou'd not have been re&s;tricted to &s;ilence any longer; as there was &s;omething in this harangue which touched him in the ten|dere&s;t part, and as the good man was always ready armed for religious controver&s;y, he was ju&s;t &s;tepping into the li&s;ts, when he &s;aw the per&s;on of the doctor vani&s;h at the door with hat and cane in hand, not waiting for a re|joinder, which was likely to be &s;o little to his ta&s;te.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Aha!"</Q> cried Ezekiel, <Q REND="inline">"let him go for an ob&s;tinate de&s;pi&s;er of things &s;acred. Is that man, who carries a tub full of mortality before him, a proper champion to &s;et death and re|pentance at defiance?

<P>All things, however, come to an end, and even Ezekiel's preaching did not la&s;t for ever, &s;o that our hero was at length left to his repo&s;e, or I &s;hould rather have &s;aid to tho&s;e in|tere&s;ting meditations, which occupied his mind too fully to admit of &s;leep. The important paquet was again re&s;orted to; the di&s;covery therein contained, gave him a name and &s;tation in &s;ociety; new duties, new &s;en&s;ations now commenced; now he di&s;cerned the pure ma|ternal &s;ource, from whence tho&s;e tender tran&s;|ports were derived, that had occa&s;ioned his alarm, and rou&s;ed the jealous rage of Lord Crowbery; but he &s;aw with infinite regret, that circum&s;tances, ju&s;tified by nature, never

could be explained, and how to re&s;cue his unhappy parent from her danger he knew not: ardently he longed to throw him&s;elf at her feet and receive her ble&s;&s;ing, but all ap|proaches were barred again&s;t him; no choice was left but to re&s;ort for protection to the ho&s;pitable hou&s;e of Sir Roger Man&s;tock, and he now regarded him not only as the friend of Ratcliffe, but as the uncle of his mother; a con&s;ideration that greatly relieved him from many of his &s;cruples; a &s;um in bank notes, which was inclo&s;ed within the cover of his mother's letter, very amply furni&s;hed him with an independence as to money matters, a favor of all others the mo&s;t painful to &s;olicit from any benefactor but a parent. He re&s;olved there|fore to &s;et out for Man&s;tock-hou&s;e with the return of morning, and it is no improbable conjecture, that in forming this re&s;olution, ideas of a certain &s;ort, not ab&s;olutely devoid of hope, nor far removed from the fir&s;t dawn|ings of a tender pa&s;&s;ion, had a &s;hare in his deci&s;ions; certain it is, that he had little courage for the undertaking in his former humble ob|&s;curity, though the invitation had been held out to him by the worthy Baronet in the mo&s;t gracious manner.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="123">At length the morning dawned, when the &s;ound of voices under his window occa&s;ioned him to open the ca&s;ement and enquire into the cau&s;e of it.

In this conclu&s;ion all were of a mind, and the bu&s;ine&s;s ended in their &s;eparating on the &s;pot, and &s;everally returning quietly to their own homes.</P>

<P>Our hero in the mean time had accoutered him&s;elf to the be&s;t advantage: though the effects of a &s;leeple&s;s night were di&s;coverable in his eyes and complexion, his model was &s;uch as academies might rejoice in, and theatres applaud; the child of love, offspring of parents in the prime of youth and bloom of beauty, he inherited all his mother's &s;weetne&s;s, and his father's fire; whil&s;t nature and education had united to repay him for tho&s;e penalties, which the law had laid upon his birth.</P>

<P>After a few minutes Ezekiel Daw de&s;cended from his loft; his air and &s;tep had more than u&s;ual &s;olemnity, and his countenance was ex|pre&s;&s;ive of a tender melancholy; his voice, naturally &s;harp and acrimonious, was now pitched in its &s;ofte&s;t and lowe&s;t key, when he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to our hero in the following terms:</P>

<P><PB N="126" REF="129"><Q REND="inline">"Well, well, well!"</Q> replied the worthy creature, <Q REND="inline">"here is my hand; you &s;ee your fault, and there's an end of it; but never think that I can be &s;urpriz'd by the unruly pa&s;&s;ion of anger: No, no, thank Heaven, no man can ever throw that &s;tone at me.

<P>Here the conver&s;ation ended with a very af|fectionate reply from Henry, in return for this kind &s;peech; and, not long after, a &s;ervant ar|rived from Sir Roger Man&s;tock's, in a one-hor&s;e chair, for the conveyance of Su&s;an and the baggage, and at the &s;ame time a groom with a led hor&s;e for Henry.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="130">After a ride of about twelve miles through a fertile and plea&s;ant country, our hero came in &s;ight of Man&s;tock-hou&s;e, the antient &s;eat of that re&s;pectable family, which through many generations had pre&s;erved it in it's original character without alteration or derangement: the &s;ame venerable avenues, the &s;ame walled gardens and formal parterres, held their &s;ta|tions around it; it's turrets were untouched, it's windows had not felt the hand of modern art, and the pari&s;h church &s;till kept it's po&s;t of a clo&s;e and faithful centinel over the morals of the family. The village &s;pread it&s;elf to the north and we&s;t, and in the oppo&s;ite quarter an inlet of the &s;ea, at about a mile's di&s;tance, bounded a park well furni&s;hed with groupes of &s;tately timber-trees; the fields and pa&s;tures about the village &s;hewed them&s;elves in a &s;tate of high cultivation, whil&s;t &s;everal farm-hou&s;es in detached &s;ituations added greatly to the life and beauty of the land&s;cape.</P>
<P>Henry had &s;topt upon the height to con|template this animated pro&s;pect, and whil&s;t he was thus employed, the venerable Baronet and his fair daughter joined him on hor&s;eback. Sir Roger was not a man of many words, neither did he excel in the modern fa&s;hion of addre&s;s,
<PB N="128" REF="131">
but he had a &s;tile of welcoming his gue&s;ts, that expre&s;&s;ed his own &s;incerity, and put them ef|fectually at their ea&s;e: his reception of our young adventurer was peculiarly cordial; it told him in few words that the heart of the owner was like the hou&s;e, open, large, ho&s;pi|table, and old-fa&s;hioned. Su&s;an was &s;ent home in the chair by the &s;horte&s;t road, whil&s;t Henry, at his own reque&s;t, was permitted to accom|pany the party on hor&s;eback in their circuit through the grounds, which, after a very plea|&s;ant tour, brought them to the village: here they &s;topt at a neat little man&s;ion, which &s;eemed newly repaired, and had a piece of ground at the back of it laid out as a garden, and well cropt with u&s;eful vegetables.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"This little tenement,"</Q> &s;aid Sir Roger, <Q REND="inline">"belongs to I&s;abella, and &s;he is mi&s;tre&s;s of the works here carrying on; therefore I believe we mu&s;t pay our court to her by di&s;mounting from our hor&s;es, and taking a view of her per|formances."</Q>&mdash;Upon the word, Henry leapt from the &s;addle, and pre&s;ented him&s;elf at the lady's &s;tirrup, who accepted of his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I propo&s;e,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"with my father's leave, to put Su&s;an's mother into this cottage: what is your opinion of it? Perhaps &s;he will
<PB N="129" REF="132">
not find her&s;elf &s;o comfortable here as in that &s;he is accu&s;tom'd to, but I flatter my&s;elf &s;he will be more mercifully treated."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"'Tis a little paradi&s;e,"</Q> cried Henry, as he looked about him; <Q REND="inline">"and, if I could contemplate her happine&s;s with envy, it would be for living in &s;uch a place, and under &s;uch a patrone&s;s."</Q></P>
<P>It was truly a mo&s;t enviable little man&s;ion, in which the generous care of the fair owner had provided again&s;t every want, that its de&s;|tined inhabitants could be &s;uppo&s;ed to have: upon the ground-floor, be&s;ides a kitchen &s;tock|ed with every nece&s;&s;ary, there was a &s;itting-room neatly papered, and beyond that a &s;mall office fitted up with &s;helves, which, I&s;abella ob|&s;erved, would &s;erve the good dame as her &s;hop of medicines. Over the chimney in the &s;itting-room I&s;abella had hung a print, which not only bore the name, but al&s;o a very &s;trong likene&s;s, of her father. When Henry had con|templated this print for &s;ome moments, he turned his eyes upon I&s;abella, as if he was &s;earching for a re&s;emblance in her features: &s;ome tender &s;entiment at that moment had called the tears into her eyes; Henry caught it by the &s;wifte&s;t glance that delicacy permitted him to indulge&mdash;&s;wift as it was, it offered up
<PB N="130" REF="133">
her whole heart to his view, where filial affec|tion, amid&s;t a thou&s;and tender &s;en&s;ibilities, held pre-eminence; the &s;ympathetic impul&s;e was communicated in an in&s;tant; the intelligence of kindred &s;ouls is quick as thought it&s;elf: in &s;pite of his addre&s;s the glance had pa&s;&s;ed and repa&s;&s;ed, that carried with it the reciprocal &s;en|&s;ation of two feeling hearts: nothing was &s;aid, but all was under&s;tood; &s;ouls can confer with|out the noi&s;y vehicle of words.&mdash;Sir Roger Man&s;tock was at this time talking with a la|bourer in the garden.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t &s;hew you the chambers on the upper floor,"</Q> &s;aid I&s;abella. Henry followed her in &s;ilence: the &s;tairs were &s;teep; he for|got him&s;elf, and let her lead the way: he &s;uf|fered for his over&s;ight as &s;uch forgetfulne&s;s de|&s;erved; his heart was doomed to encounter an emotion of another &s;ort from that he had &s;o lately felt. Ill-fated youth! are all Ezekiel's precepts &s;o &s;oon forgotten? He would have told thee there is danger in every atom of a beautiful dam&s;el, from the crown of her head even to the taper extremities of tho&s;e elegant limbs, which thine unguarded eye took in. Thoughtle&s;s, devoted victim! whither art thou climbing? Thou do&s;t but follow to inevitable
<PB N="131" REF="134">
&s;acrifice: thy fate precedes thee, and trains thee up a precipice, from whence it is decreed that thou mu&s;t fall.</P>
<P>At length they have reached the &s;ummit of their a&s;cent: a door on each &s;ide opened to a bed-chamber, which &s;eemed to &s;ay that here benevolence had provided an a&s;ylum for the repo&s;e of peace. The &s;implicity here di&s;played, which Horace in two happy words de&s;cribes, I could not convey in twenty; it was ele|gance, that mode&s;t poverty would not blu&s;h to avow; it was ta&s;te &s;o void of ornament that the di&s;po&s;er's excellence con&s;i&s;ted in the con|cealment of her art.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"You &s;ee,"</Q> cried I&s;abella, <Q REND="inline">"I have provided for the good man, who lodges with the widow; if he comes,"</Q> added &s;he, pointing to the bed, <Q REND="inline">"there is re&s;t from his labours."</Q></P>
<P>Henry took notice that Ezekiel's chamber was provided with a &s;mall ne&s;t of &s;helves for books; neither did it e&s;cape him that I&s;abella had conveyed a compliment to his charity by adorning his chimney with a print of the <HI>good Samaritan.</HI> In the chamber of Dame May &s;he had hung a print al&s;o, which repre&s;ented the &s;tory of the widow of Zarephath and the prophet Elijah. The&s;e, with many other cir|cum&s;tances
<PB N="132" REF="135">
in the accommodations of the hou&s;e, &s;hewed him how thoroughly I&s;abella po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the happy quality of doubling her favours by the grace of be&s;towing them.</P>
<P>They now remounted their hor&s;es and pro|ceeded to the man&s;ion. To Henry, who had all his life been accu&s;tomed to the &s;mall and pri|vate &s;cale of a country clergyman's e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, this was a new and curious &s;cene; as they pa&s;&s;ed through a Gothic gateway into the front court, a venerable per&s;onage, dre&s;&s;ed in a tufted gown, and holding a &s;ilver-headed &s;taff in his hand, pre&s;ented him&s;elf to the wondering &s;ight of our hero; at the &s;ame time a bell was tolled in the turret, which gave &s;olemn notice of their approach, and &s;ummoned the dome&s;|tics to their po&s;ts in the great hall: here, ac|cording to the fa&s;hion of old times, the Baronet took Henry by the hand and welcom'd him to Man&s;tock-hou&s;e. Scenes, that he had only read of in de&s;cription, were now pre&s;ent to his view; every thing within the hou&s;e perfectly corre&s;ponded with the &s;tile and character of the exterior: walls built for perpetuity, rooms calculated for feudal ho&s;pitality, and &s;pace wantonly lavi&s;hed without regard to oeconomy or convenience, be&s;poke the rude magnificence
<PB N="133" REF="136">
of the founder; the very &s;ervants &s;eemed in age and habit of another century. The hall was hung round with banners and trophies of va|rious &s;orts, both of war and of the chace: over an immen&s;e &s;pan of fire-place was di&s;played the family &s;hield, containing a va&s;t number of bearings properly illuminated and arranged according to the rules of heraldry, and at the upper end the portrait of an old man at full length in a black habit, with the en&s;igns of the garter and the blue ribbon hanging in a point from his neck, holding a &s;croll in his hand, on which was traced the ground plot of the hou&s;e, and be&s;poke him to be the founder of it.</P>
<P>Sir Roger Man&s;tock's family con&s;i&s;ted of one only daughter; he had lo&s;t his lady about three years pa&s;t. I&s;abella, the darling of her father, had now entered her eighteenth year, and &s;ince her mother's death had con&s;tantly re&s;ided with him, and of late had taken the po&s;t and pre&s;idency of mi&s;tre&s;s of the fa|mily. With a table always open to his friends and neighbours, Sir Roger pa&s;&s;ed his time in a con&s;tant re&s;idence at Man&s;tock-hou&s;e, in the center of a very noble property, beloved by all that knew him, and doing good to all
<PB N="134" REF="137">
that depended on him. When his friends &s;olicited him to &s;tand forth as county member, telling him that all parties would join in elect|ing him, his con&s;tant an&s;wer was, that he thanked them for their good opinion, but his utmo&s;t ambition was to live among&s;t them, fulfilling to the be&s;t of his capacity the duties of an acting magi&s;trate and a plain country gentleman; in which &s;tation he humbly con|ceived he &s;hould &s;erve them better, and ap|prove him&s;elf a more u&s;eful member of the community, than by attending upon parlia|ment, for which he mode&s;tly, and perhaps truly, a&s;&s;erted that he had no talents.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER V. The Coward out of Doors is a Lion in his own Hou&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING now &s;o happily di&s;po&s;ed of our hero for a while, we are at lei&s;ure to look back to the &s;tate of affairs at Crowbery Ca&s;tle, where the mi&s;adventure of Ju&s;tice Blachford had made no &s;light impre&s;&s;ion. The Captain, who had laid his plan of the pre&s;s-gang,
<PB N="135" REF="138">
as we have related, was now deterred from putting it to the experiment, not only by the &s;hameful cata&s;trophe of Blachford's mur|derous plot, but al&s;o by the con&s;ideration of Sir Roger Man&s;tock's having taken Henry into his protection. Blachford's ca&s;e was &s;till extremely doubtful; he &s;eemed to be do&s;ing away his life, with few and &s;hort intervals of faint and imperfect &s;en&s;ibility; the &s;cull was evidently fractured, and Zachary had pro|nounced upon the trepan as indi&s;pen&s;able: it had been thought proper, however, to call in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a London &s;urgeon, and his arrival was hourly expected. Nobody doubted his being the victim of his own plot; but O'Rourke, who probably would have brought it home to him in his own defence, had e&s;caped from the people who apprehended him, and was far enough out of reach; nobody &s;tirred in his pur&s;uit, and the few per&s;ons, who were intere&s;ted to conceal the evidence of Blach|ford's criminality, were much more likely to a&s;&s;i&s;t his flight than to &s;top it. To leave the matter my&s;terious, or rather to aim at making it &s;o, was the mo&s;t they could hope for: to ca&s;t &s;u&s;picion upon Henry was out of their power, no chicanery could do that again&s;t the
<PB N="136" REF="139">
joint force of &s;o many witne&s;&s;es, who cou'd depo&s;e to the very words that O'Rourke had uttered, when he confe&s;&s;ed that what he had done was by his ma&s;ter's orders, only that he had mi&s;taken the per&s;on upon whom they were to have been executed; and this account, in which they perfectly agreed, was circulated over all the neighbourhood. In the mean time old Weevil the miller, who had been eventually the pre&s;erver of Henry's life, by per&s;uading him to return with him through the park, was not idle in publi&s;hing his account of the affair, and the motives that induced him fortunately to advi&s;e as he did. Blachford, therefore, whether living or dying, was effec|tually ruined in reputation, and &s;o univer&s;ally execrated as the vile&s;t of wretches, that even the Vi&s;count him&s;elf, and his &s;atellites the law|yer and the captain, were fain to di&s;avow him. Still the heart of the proud peer rankled with rage and jealou&s;y: di&s;appointed of the revenge he had promi&s;ed him&s;elf to enjoy through the means of others, and intimidated from taking any open mea&s;ures of his own again&s;t the object of his malice by the firm language Henry had held in his late interview, his da&s;|tardly &s;pirit had no other re&s;ource but to vent
<PB N="137" REF="140">
it&s;elf upon the defencele&s;s party in his power, and in this his cruelty knew no bounds. In his treatment of Lady Crowbery he kept no terms of decency or re&s;erve, publi&s;hing to all parties (not even his own dome&s;tics excepted) the charges he had again&s;t her&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Will you tell me,"</Q> he wou'd a&s;k, <Q REND="inline">"that wife is virtuous, who was not only &s;een by others, but whom I my&s;elf &s;aw, hanging upon the neck of a hand&s;ome vagabond, embracing him in her arms, and care&s;&s;ing him with all the ec&s;tacy of an enflamed and guilty pa&s;&s;ion? Who will &s;ay that this is not an action that implies crimi|nality &s;o &s;trongly, that ocular demon&s;tration could &s;carce add to the conviction of it? What other motive but one can a woman of her &s;ort have for a conduct &s;o extraordinary towards a fellow, who is a perfect &s;tranger to her, and who, till &s;he put cloaths upon his back, had not a pocket to hold the money &s;he la|vi&s;hly be&s;towed upon him? Will any one per&s;uade me that all the&s;e favours and fondne&s;&s;es are to be accounted for rom mere re&s;pect to the memory of a certain par&s;on Ratcliffe, who picked him up as a foundling, and whom &s;he has not &s;et eyes on for the&s;e twelve years

pa&s;t? The mere&s;t dupe in nature could not find credulity for &s;uch a tale."</Q></P>
<P>In this &s;tile his Lord&s;hip took every occa&s;ion to vent his grievances, and make public the breach between him&s;elf and Lady Crowbery: When in conference with her he would hold a har&s;her language; and as he pre&s;&s;ed for an&s;wers, which the difficulty of her &s;ituation would not allow her to give, every interview &s;erved only to &s;trengthen his conclu&s;ions and enflame his animo&s;ity.</P>
<P>It was generally &s;u&s;pected that a &s;eparation would take place, and this he had threatened her with; but when &s;he &s;howed a willingne&s;s to meet him in this mea&s;ure, he &s;eemed to drop it altogether, and the rather, as in that ca&s;e her paternal e&s;tate would have remained with her, which during their joint e&s;tabli&s;h|ment was &s;o liberally applied to the common &s;tock, that the major part of the family di&s;|bur&s;ements was provided for out of her fund. He had however long abandoned all hope of any benefit upon the contingency of his &s;ur|vivor&s;hip, and of an heir there was now no longer any pro&s;pect. As he had therefore no intere&s;t in view on either of the&s;e accounts,
<PB N="139" REF="142">
he kept no check upon his ill-humour and chagrin, but per&s;ecuted her without re&s;erve, ab&s;olutely confining her to the hou&s;e, and, as far as he could prevent it, not &s;uffering her to corre&s;pond with any one, particularly her rela|tions of the hou&s;e of Man&s;tock, to whom he bore peculiar hatred and inveteracy.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What does your uncle mean,"</Q> &s;aid he in one of his altercations, <Q REND="inline">"by receiving that fel|low into his family, who has &s;o effectually de|&s;troyed the peace of mine?

Does Sir Roger think that I want &s;pirit to re&s;ent &s;uch conduct, or can he &s;uppo&s;e that I am tame enough to &s;ubmit to an indignity, which he renders ten times more galling by the countenance he &s;hews to the de&s;picable object of my re&s;ent|ment&mdash;your Lady&s;hip's beggarly Adonis?"</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VI. Danger approaches, and the Doctor is di&s;mi&s;s'd.</HEAD>
<P>IN this manner the &s;ad and heavy hours dragged &s;lowly on at Crowbery ca&s;tle. Do|me&s;tic altercations, jealou&s;ies, and complaints on the part of Lord Crowbery, pre&s;&s;ed down the &s;pirits, and now began to &s;ap and under|mine the con&s;titution of his unhappy lady.
<PB N="144" REF="147">
Her confinement was become no le&s;s a matter of nece&s;&s;ity than of obedience; &s;he took her meals, and pa&s;&s;ed her whole day, in her &s;eparate apartment; and as great pains were be&s;towed in keeping the affair of Blachford's plot and its providential i&s;&s;ue from her knowledge, it was not till after the dialogue recited in the preced|ing chapter had taken place, that &s;he came to the knowledge of that di&s;graceful bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip's &s;u&s;picion pointed at Zachary as the informer on this occa&s;ion; and though a pretty &s;trict watch was kept upon him in his vi&s;its, probably the &s;u&s;picion afore&s;aid was not ill placed, for our hone&s;t Doctor had great at|tachment to his noble patient, and very little to her ignoble lord: our hero al&s;o had an intere&s;t in his heart; Blachford he dete&s;ted, and though he did his duty to him faithfully and &s;kilfully, for he had now performed the operation of the trepan, yet if he had been dre&s;&s;ing the wounds of a wretch condemned for murder, he proba|bly could not have felt le&s;s &s;ympathy for the &s;ufferings of his patient. The impre&s;&s;ion, which the &s;tory of Blachford's plot made upon Lady Crowbery's mind, was &s;uch as left a &s;trong per&s;ua&s;ion of my Lord's participation in that ba&s;e attempt, and from this moment &s;he
<PB N="145" REF="148">
could not &s;ee him without horror: fixt in her re&s;olution to enter into no further di&s;cu&s;&s;ions with him, all intercour&s;e between them was &s;u&s;pended.</P>
<P>One day, as &s;he was &s;itting alone and pen|&s;ive in her chamber, ruminating on the &s;ad fortune of her life, and the mi&s;eries which an attachment fatally traver&s;ed had entailed upon her, as &s;he drew out her handkerchief to &s;taunch the tears that were flowing from her eyes, a little packet dropt on the floor, which &s;he took up, and &s;oon di&s;covered to be the &s;ame that Henry had delivered to her, inclo&s;|ing the ring, but which, in the hurry of her &s;pirits at that moment, &s;he had ha&s;tily put into her pocket, and from that time it had e&s;caped her recollection.</P>
<P>What was her &s;urprize, upon unfolding the envelope, to di&s;cover the very ring &s;he had given to her beloved Delapoer, when they ex|changed their pledges, and &s;olemnly devoted their hearts and affections each to the other.</P>
<P>With eager trepidation &s;he turned it over and over, minutely examining it in every part. The hair, the &s;tone, the &s;etting, the motto, every particle depo&s;ed to the identity of the object; not a doubt remained; a&s;toni&s;hment
<PB N="146" REF="149">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her wholly; &s;he &s;hook in every joint, and feit a tumult at her heart, that her enfee|bled frame could &s;carce &s;upport. Happily &s;he was alone; and when &s;he could command &s;uf|ficient recollection to debate the ca&s;e, and &s;hape her thoughts into &s;ome form and order, &s;he began to give them vent, talking to her&s;elf, in broken &s;entences, after the following manner:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"The very ring I gave to Delapoer! the pledge of love, my fir&s;t, my only love! a&s;&s;ur|edly it is the &s;ame! I cannot be mi&s;taken! Oh memory of a fond fleeting moment, thou art much too faithful to deceive, or be deceiv'd! How came it here? Is he that own'd it living, and return'd to England, or is he dead, and, dying, gave it in commi&s;&s;ion to &s;ome friend to render back to me? Let me recal to mind what Henry told me; a man had found it, a poor man, return'd from tran&s;portation; that may be him&s;elf; well may he call it &s;o; 'twas bani&s;hment, 'twas tran&s;portation for the crime of loving one, whom the hard heart of an in|exorable parent wre&s;ted from his arms too late for honour. Ah cruel father! there was a mo|ment, when, if you had relented, your poor child had never known the&s;e agonies, that now mu&s;t plunge her in the grave: had you per|mitted
<PB N="147" REF="150">
her to take her own heart's choice, and at the altar &s;anctify tho&s;e vows, which Heaven had heard and regi&s;ter'd, your daughter had been now a happy mother, and po&s;terity wou'd have ble&s;&s;ed you; in&s;tead of which, behold a jealous tyrant and a barren bed! Oh! bar|barous &s;oul-en&s;laving law, devis'd in an ac|cur&s;ed hour to counteract the fir&s;t great ble&s;|&s;ing pronounc'd by the Creator on his works, which alike makes wretched tho&s;e who obey, and tho&s;e who de&s;perately evade it; which gives a power to parents that is their cur&s;e, entailing a dreadful re&s;pon&s;ibility on &s;uch as enforce it, and violating the mo&s;t &s;acred pri|vileges of all who are re&s;train'd by it."</Q></P>
<P>This &s;aid, &s;he ro&s;e, and opening a little ca&s;ket, where other tokens were depo&s;ited, lodged it among&s;t them, referring it to time, the revealer of all my&s;teries, to elucidate this among&s;t the re&s;t; and recollecting it had been told her by Henry, that the finder of the ring &s;aid he would call again for his reward&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Alas!"</Q> &s;aid &s;he, as this reflection oc|curred, <Q REND="inline">"what have I to be&s;tow, that De|lapoer wou'd now deem a reward? Cou'd I endure the meeting, ought I even to wi&s;h it? Shou'd I not in di&s;cretion avoid it? If there
<PB N="148" REF="151">
is any remnant of affection left in his heart for me, will not the &s;ight of &s;uch a faded form, and the di&s;covery of my wretchedne&s;s, give angui&s;h to his feelings?&mdash;But then my &s;on! my Henry!&mdash;How el&s;e &s;hall I di&s;clo&s;e to Delapoer the intere&s;ting intelligence that he is a father? O Henry, for thy &s;ake I wou'd abide that trial!"</Q></P>
<P>It was now the hour for Zachary to pay his profe&s;&s;ional vi&s;it: curio&s;ity, or &s;ome mo|tive not connected with kindne&s;s, induced Lord Crowbery to accompany him on this occa&s;ion: his pre&s;ence was not calculated to quiet un|ea&s;ine&s;s of any kind; and Zachary's fingers had no &s;ooner touched his patient's pul&s;e, than he gave my Lord a &s;ignificant look, which not only indicated alarm at what he di&s;covered by his touch, but &s;eemed to intimate that he knew, by his intuition, where the cau&s;e of it was to be found.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am told, madam,"</Q> &s;aid my lord, <Q REND="inline">"you are indi&s;po&s;ed; I &s;hould wi&s;h to hear the nature of your complaint, and what this gentleman's opinion is of your ca&s;e."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"So plea&s;e you, my lord,"</Q> replied the man of medicine, <Q REND="inline">"it is not our practice to di&s;cu&s;s tho&s;e points in the hearing of our patients."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="152"><Q REND="inline">"Cannot you pre&s;cribe then,"</Q> &s;aid the Peer, <Q REND="inline">"when I am pre&s;ent; or have you no advice to offer, till you have con&s;ulted with her Lady&s;hip what remedy &s;he likes be&s;t?"</Q></P>
<P>There was a taunting &s;neer in this, which Zachary's &s;pirit did not quite reli&s;h; he had all due con&s;ideration for the dignity of a noble; but he was not without &s;ome &s;en&s;e of his own con&s;equence, and the honour al&s;o due unto the phy&s;ician: he an&s;wered, therefore, with more quickne&s;s than was expected, that, to the be&s;t of &s;uch judgment as he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, he &s;hould pre&s;cribe in due time; but there was a di&s;order in her lady&s;hip's pul&s;e, which he took to be incidental rather than &s;ymptomatic, and he be|lieved the be&s;t remedy for her ca&s;e, at pre&s;ent, would be perfect quiet and a &s;ilent room.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"By which I am to under&s;tand,"</Q> rejoined the peer, <Q REND="inline">"that you cou'd very readily di&s;|pen&s;e with my company, and remain here your&s;elf&mdash;will that promote &s;ilence, do you think? If you have nothing to &s;ay that I &s;hou'd not hear, and &s;ilence be &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for her lady&s;hip, I can &s;it here without opening my lips, whil&s;t you pur&s;ue your ob&s;ervations with|out interruption, and meditate at lei&s;ure on the remedies you are to apply."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="153"><Q REND="inline">"My Lord,"</Q> replied the &s;age, <Q REND="inline">"if I am worthy to be entru&s;ted with the health of Lady Crowbery, I hope I am not &s;u&s;pected as unfit to be left with her in private."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"No more arguing, Mr. Apothecary, if you plea&s;e,"</Q> quoth the noble intruder; <Q REND="inline">"do the bu&s;ine&s;s you are &s;ent for; and remember, that it is for the contents of your gallipots, and not for the charms of your conver&s;ation, that I employ you in my family."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have been employ'd,"</Q> quoth Zachary, <Q REND="inline">"for my lady and her family, many years before I was honour'd with your Lord&s;hip's commands, and I never was treated in Sir Andrew's family but with confidence and kind|ne&s;s: I hope I am not likely to forget my &s;tation in &s;ociety, and how far it is removed from that, which your Lord&s;hip now fills; but I can at the &s;ame time recollect, that the di&s;tance between them has not always been &s;o great."</Q></P>
<P>For the better under&s;tanding of this glance, at the conclu&s;ion of Zachary's reply, we mu&s;t inform the reader, that the noble per&s;onage, at whom it was pointed, had, in the early days of his worldly pilgrimage, walked in the hum|ble line of an officer of his Maje&s;ty's cu&s;toms,
<PB N="151" REF="154">
in which &s;tation he was totally unnoticed by the head of his family, and, indeed, by every other family who&s;e notice was worth having, until the title, and &s;uch part of the e&s;tate as was entailed upon it by a variety of intermediate contingencies, devolved on him. Though not deficient in talents of a certain &s;ort, he had been greatly cramped in his education by the poverty of his parents, and, as far as precept and example reach, very little benefited by either. With the great world, &s;ince he had been made a part of it, he had formed little or no acquaintance; and con&s;cious of his de|ficiencies in the acquirements of a gentleman, he had never taken his &s;eat &s;ince his acce&s;&s;ion to the peerage; &s;hutting him&s;elf up in his ca&s;tle with a few mean dependants about him, who flattered him in his humours, whil&s;t they fed at his table, he lived in &s;ullen pride, avoiding all his neighbours of a better &s;ort, and avoided by them. When he made propo&s;als for his pre&s;ent lady, he had newly &s;ucceeded to his title, and, it may well be pre&s;umed, he was more indebted to a certain incident in her hi&s;tory, well remembered by her father, though carefully concealed, than to the elegance of his own manners and addre&s;s. A title and
<PB N="152" REF="155">
e&s;tate, however, were circum&s;tances not over|looked in the brief catalogue of his accompli&s;h|ments; they doubtle&s;s had their weight with Sir Andrew; and for the lady's &s;hare in the tran&s;action, that was purely negative; a broken &s;pirit, a dubious reputation, and a blank indif|ference to all mankind, with one exception only, made her con&s;ent to an act of duty and atonement, not of choice and free will. In this manner they married, and upon the terms which &s;uch marriages naturally produce, they lived together joyle&s;s, comfortle&s;s, childle&s;s.</P>
<P>The glance, therefore, which Zachary had retorted upon his lord&s;hip's former ob&s;curity, rou&s;ed his pre&s;ent dignity into a flame of rage. It is not in the art of the mo&s;t ingenious tor|mentor to puni&s;h the object of his vengeance half &s;o bitterly, as the proud man, without any art or ingenuity at all, naturally contrives to puni&s;h him&s;elf. No &s;ooner had Zachary's words entered the porches of his ears, than in an in&s;tant, like <HI>the leporous di&s;tilment</HI> de&s;cribed by Hamlet's gho&s;t, it cour&s;ed through all the natural gates and alleys of his blood, po&s;t-ha&s;te, to the &s;eat and head quarters of the &s;pleen (if any of my readers know where that is to be found) and there it &s;welled and fermented at
<PB N="153" REF="156">
&s;uch a rate, that his bo&s;om was not wide enough to hold it, but out it bur&s;t, &s;puttering and frothing, from his lips, in accents very little re&s;embling tho&s;e that &s;hortly after fell with gentle cadence from the &s;ofter lips of Lady Crowbery. Enough was under&s;tood, from the inarticulate vehemence of his lord&s;hip's wrath, to di&s;cover that Zachary Cawdle, &s;urgeon, apothecary, and man-midwife, was in no future time to exerci&s;e any one of the&s;e &s;everal branches of his art within the walls of Crow|bery Ca&s;tle, or upon the per&s;on of any one who belonged thereunto.</P>
<P>Zachary had ri&s;en from his &s;eat with an ira&s;|cibility little le&s;s than boiling hot, and with a countenance, whole &s;carlet hue of downright hone&s;t anger wonderfully contra&s;ted the pale and &s;ickly complection of his lord&s;hip's ma|lice, when the gentle invalid, directing a look of mild benevolence to her di&s;carded attend|ant, addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to him in the following terms&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Farewel, my long approv'd and worthy friend! I lo&s;e your &s;ervices when they can be of no further u&s;e to me; you &s;ee the &s;ituation I am in, and you know it is incurable. It is not in your art to &s;ave me, and you are only di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from a fruitle&s;s attendance, and

the painful &s;pectacle of an expiring friend. For all pa&s;t care and kindne&s;s, and a thou&s;and zealous offices, which your good will to me has prompted you to perform, I render you my la&s;t, my cordial thanks. Go to my uncle Man&s;tock; tell him I am in a fair way to &s;hake off all complaints, and want no more medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance: when that is over, and my cure completed, he will &s;hew you that your &s;ervices have not been overlook'd, and that I have bequeath'd you a fee, which I hope will &s;et me clear at the clo&s;e of our account."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"God forbid! God forbid!"</Q> cried Zachary, the tears bubbling from his eyes, <Q REND="inline">"it &s;hou'd be my &s;ad lot to outlive you. Providence in its mercy re&s;tore you! But continue, I be&s;eech you, the valerian draughts: I had other me|dicines in re&s;erve; but I take heaven to wit|ne&s;s, I am di&s;mi&s;s'd from my attendance, when my patient's pul&s;e is at a hundred and twenty-five."</Q></P>

<P>Whether the deputy doctor took this as a &s;ide-blow at him&s;elf I cannot &s;ay, but certainly a learned di&s;pute &s;prung up between him and his principal upon the application of the tre|pan, which branch'd out into &s;o many zig|zags and cro&s;scuts, and was carried on with &s;o little method, and &s;o much abu&s;e of brevity, that after Zachary's vanity had run foul of Alexander's &s;pleen, his choler began to chafe and fume at &s;uch a rate, that pe&s;tle and mortar never &s;et up a more clamorous argument than now en&s;ued between ma&s;ter and man, which
<PB N="158" REF="161">
was only put an end to by the &s;uperior din of Jemima's bell.</P>
<P>In the mean time the hours at Man&s;tock Hou&s;e moved on in harmony and peace: each divi&s;ion of the day had its appropriated occu|pation or amu&s;ement: the morning ride, the &s;ocial meal, the evening walk, the hour of re&s;t, each link of time kept it's due place and pe|riod: order and regularity were &s;o perfectly ob&s;erved throughout the whole e&s;tabli&s;hment, that though the &s;pirit of the ma&s;ter pervaded every part, his voice was no where heard; the dome&s;tics were a numerous body, but, like well-di&s;ciplined veterans, each knew his duty, and no one &s;werved from it.</P>
<P>Here our hero might have repo&s;ed in ab&s;o|lute tranquillity, had his feelings been le&s;s alive to the di&s;con&s;olate &s;ituation of his &s;uffer|ing mother, or had his wandering fancy (for why &s;hould I conceal the truth?) permitted him to enjoy the comforts of an amiable &s;o|ciety, without a profe&s;t partiality to any one in particular belonging to it: but nature and philo&s;ophy are at con&s;tant variance; the warmth which one in&s;pires ill &s;uits the cool|ne&s;s which the other pre&s;cribes. Though the
<PB N="159" REF="162">
conver&s;ation of Sir Roger and the Reverend Mr. Claypole offered all the edification that experience could mini&s;ter to a youthful hearer, yet perver&s;e nature (or &s;omething we are wil|ling to a&s;cribe to nature) bia&s;&s;ed the judgment of our hero &s;o as to induce him to prefer the &s;lighte&s;t &s;yllable, that gave motion to I&s;abel|la's lovely lips, before all the anecdotes of Sir Roger, or the metaphy&s;ics of Mr. Claypole: this was not a preference which his under|&s;tanding gave, for that he never called into council on the que&s;tion; but he li&s;tened as his eyes directed him, and judged as his heart pre&s;cribed. Though he was not to learn that time moves on with equal &s;tep, yet he mi&s;cal|culated mo&s;t gro&s;sly, reckoning hours but as minutes when alone with I&s;abella, and minutes as hours without her. Any other per&s;on would have found out the&s;e were &s;ymptoms of love, Henry only found out they were mi&s;takes, and never ventured to &s;earch into the cau&s;e of them: I&s;abella, who was even le&s;s experienced, and &s;omewhat younger than him&s;elf, was &s;o &s;ure that &s;he loved no human creature com|parably to her father, and really did love him with &s;uch true devotion, that &s;he had no idea there might be attachments of another &s;ort
<PB N="160" REF="163">
to &s;hare her heart with him, and, in the full conviction of her own &s;ecurity, never once thought of what &s;he held impo&s;&s;ible to hap|pen; &s;he took her evening walks with Henry by her &s;ide, and then the weather was &s;o fine, or the pro&s;pect &s;o charming, or the di&s;cour&s;e &s;o entertaining, that the minutes &s;tole away &s;o imperceptibly &s;he could not under&s;tand how they were gone &s;o fa&s;t, and &s;he &s;o far from home; now &s;he mu&s;t ha&s;ten back, and Hen|ry's arm was wanted to a&s;&s;i&s;t her &s;peed: &s;tiles &s;ometimes intervened, and then both arms found full employment; hillocks, and dales, and foot planks over rills with waters half a foot in depth tremendou&s;ly rolling underneath, demanded a conductor of no &s;mall addre&s;s; in defiles and difficulties like the&s;e, all Hen|ry's care was none too much; yet they oc|curred &s;o frequently, that &s;lander would have &s;aid they were more &s;ought than &s;hunned.</P>

for the pre&s;ent meeting, but it was not in his nature to give pain to a fond heart like Su&s;an's; he made no effort, therefore, to divert the conver&s;ation from tho&s;e intere&s;ting points, to which &s;he wi&s;hed to lead it. Few girls of Su&s;an's &s;ort had greater quickne&s;s of intuition; and as love is, in &s;ome ca&s;es, a mighty &s;harpener of the eye-&s;ight, &s;he had taken her ob&s;ervations pretty accurately as to the effect of I&s;abella's bright eyes upon the heart of Henry, and be|ing fully &s;atisfied &s;he had no chance again&s;t &s;uch a rival, &s;he good-naturedly re&s;olved to do him all the &s;ervices in her power with that young lady, and though &s;he had little comfort to admini&s;ter to him at pre&s;ent, yet &s;he di&s;cerned enough to warrant her in talking on the &s;ubject, and reporting &s;uch particulars as might &s;erve, at lea&s;t, to keep the &s;park of hope alive; when Henry, therefore, a&s;ked her if &s;he was happy in her &s;ervice, &s;he an&s;wered, that her young lady was an angel for goodne&s;s, and if &s;he her&s;elf was not as happy as &s;he might be, it was only becau&s;e &s;he was not altogether &s;o wi&s;e as &s;he ought to be; but time, &s;he ob&s;erved, would cure her of tho&s;e follies which had taken &s;uch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"A kind word however,"</Q> added &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"now and then be&s;tow'd

<HEAD>CHAPTER IX. It now becomes doubtful, if a certain Hero is any Hero at all.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING thus decided betwixt love and honour, our hero, firm in his gallant pur|po&s;e, marched triumphantly to the hou&s;e; here, on the very thre&s;hold of the hall, he was met by the lovely object who had occa&s;ioned all his &s;truggles.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I have been &s;eeking you,"</Q> &s;he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"all over the hou&s;e: I am terribly afraid there is &s;ome bad news of my dear Lady Crowbery, for her Doctor is clo&s;etted with my father, and I dare not interrupt them. They have been calling for you in the library, and I am &s;ure you will put me out of &s;u&s;pen&s;e as &s;oon as you can learn what it is that has happened."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Certainly,"</Q> replied Henry; <Q REND="inline">"but I believe I have heard the whole: Lady Crowbery is indi&s;pos'd, but I hope not dan|gerou&s;ly;
<PB N="180" REF="183">
if I hear any thing more, you &s;hall be informed of it."</Q>&mdash;This &s;aid, he pa&s;&s;ed on to the library, where Zachary and the worthy Baronet were in clo&s;e confabulation: at their de&s;ire he &s;eated him&s;elf between them.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Henry,"</Q> (&s;aid Sir Roger Man&s;tock) <Q REND="inline">"I have ju&s;t now receiv'd a very unplea&s;ant ac|count from this gentleman, which makes it nece&s;&s;ary for me to pay a vi&s;it to my niece at Crowbery ca&s;tle, without delay. I am afraid there is too much cau&s;e to apprehend a &s;peedy decline; and as my Lord is not di&s;pos'd to avail him&s;elf of this worthy gentleman's &s;kill and experience, it behoves me very &s;eriou&s;ly to urge him to &s;ome other mea&s;ures for her re|lief, with all the expedition that her ca&s;e de|mands. If this were all I had to do, I &s;hou'd not &s;uppo&s;e that any difference cou'd ari&s;e be|tween my Lord and me; but I &s;u&s;pect there will be &s;ome points of a more difficult nature to di&s;|cu&s;s, in which we cannot po&s;&s;ibly agree, &s;o long as he per&s;i&s;ts to avow certain jealou&s;ies and &s;u&s;|picions of his lady, my niece, which I hold to be highly injurious, and totally without foun|dation: in this part of the bu&s;ine&s;s, Henry, it happens that you are involv'd; and though I want no prote&s;tations on your part to &s;atisfy
<PB N="181" REF="184">
my mind in the matter, yet if Lord Crowbery either cannot, or will not, be brought to rea&s;on upon any other terms, than your con&s;enting to put your&s;elf at a greater di&s;tance than where you now are, I am free to &s;ay, it is a requi|&s;ition, however unrea&s;onable, to which I &s;hou'd be di&s;pos'd to &s;acrifice the enjoyments I derive from your &s;ociety, rather than to leave him any pretence for the complaints, which, I un|der&s;tand, he makes of me, and the very har&s;h treatment, which, I am griev'd to hear, he practi&s;es again&s;t my niece."</Q></P>
<P>Henry now heard the very mea&s;ure pro|po&s;ed, that he was pre-determined to adopt; his an&s;wer therefore was ready, and his ac|quie&s;cence unqualified.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall be gone, Sir,"</Q> he cried, <Q REND="inline">"before his lord&s;hip can re|peat his murmurs again&s;t you for harbouring a gue&s;t &s;o obnoxious to his repo&s;e: as for the &s;u&s;picions he annexes to my &s;tay in his neigh|bourhood, I will not &s;o degrade the evidence of truth and innocence, as to honour tho&s;e &s;u&s;|picions with a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; they are the forgeries of his own malicious imagination, fabricated with the ba&s;e de&s;ign of giving &s;ome colour of excu&s;e for that tyranny of temper, which it is natural to him to indulge in, and of which,
<PB N="182" REF="185">
it &s;eems (ju&s;t Heaven requite him for his cruelty!) your injured niece, and my ever honour'd benefactre&s;s, is to be the victim. For her &s;ake I am not only ready to forego the comforts, the delights of abiding here under your protection, but to remove my&s;elf to any di&s;tance, far as &s;ea and land can carry me, if &s;o requir'd, beyond the reach of his pretended jealou&s;y. But let him have a care how he does more than brood in &s;ecret on his &s;u&s;pi|cions; let him confine his murmurs within the dark rece&s;&s;es of his own gloomy brea&s;t; let him take heed how he circulates them be|yond the walls of that ca&s;tle, in which he keeps innocence immur'd; for if any word of his &s;hall reach my ears, by which he attaches my name to an imputation, that my nature &s;hrinks from with horror unutterable, the cau&s;e is then my own, and I will bring him to &s;o &s;trict a reckoning, as &s;hall either &s;ilence his calumny, or &s;tifle my re&s;entment, for ever."</Q></P>
<P>As the youthful hero of this &s;tory thus de|livered him&s;elf, his eyes gli&s;tened, and the &s;pot of anger glowed upon his cheek. Sir Roger noted his emotion, and was enraptured, not le&s;s by the contemplation of his countenance, than by the energy of his &s;entiments: &s;o
<PB N="183" REF="186">
charmed was he with what he &s;aw and heard, that his heart &s;mote him with compunction for having &s;ignified to him a kind of warning from his hou&s;e.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Gracious Heaven!"</Q> he cried, turning to Zachary, and &s;triking his hands together, (as was cu&s;tomary with him when &s;urpri&s;ed with any &s;udden thought) <Q REND="inline">"am I to &s;acrifice the delight of cheri&s;hing a &s;pirit like this, in compliment to the caprice of a dome&s;tic tyrant? What &s;tore of virtues do I contemplate dawning in the bo&s;om of this gallant youth; and &s;hall I lo&s;e the pride of fo&s;tering their growth? It is too much: Henry, my noble fellow, we'll &s;et this paltry Peer at naught; I never can con&s;ent to part from you."</Q></P>
<P>Age had not deadened the &s;en&s;ibility of this venerable old man; he was greatly moved, his voice &s;hook, and he cla&s;ped the hand of Henry in his. Zachary, who had much of the milk, or rather the butter, of human kind|ne&s;s in his compo&s;ition, melted like a thaw; and taking out his handkerchief, without any fine&s;&s;e, began a tune upon his olfactory organ little le&s;s &s;onorous, and not more mu&s;ical, than the cow-horn of Joe Jenkins. Our hero him|&s;elf was &s;haken, but not overthrown; his
<PB N="184" REF="187">
courage reeled, but it did not go back from the po&s;t he had taken, and he maintained his re&s;olution of abiding by Sir Roger's fir&s;t propo&s;al, which he a&s;&s;erted to be nece&s;&s;ary on more accounts than one; at the &s;ame time he expre&s;&s;ed a hope, that he might be allowed to accompany him to the ca&s;tle, where he thought he had a right to appear, as the party accu&s;ed; and ob&s;erving withal, it was po&s;&s;ible that Sir Roger, in conference with a per&s;on of Lord Crowbery's brutal nature, and alone, might not be treated with all the re&s;pect due to his per&s;on and character.</P>
<P>This propo&s;al did not &s;uit the &s;pirit of Sir Roger, neither was it a thing practicable or advi&s;eable, &s;o that he put a peremptory ne|gative upon it at once, adding, in a tone of voice &s;omewhat above his u&s;ual key, that if an affront was offered to him&s;elf or family, though he was too old for ha&s;ty mea&s;ures, he was not yet pa&s;t the age for manly re&s;ent|ment. He now ordered four hor&s;es to be put to his chai&s;e with all ha&s;te, and de&s;ired Henry to inform Mi&s;s Man&s;tock, that he was &s;imply going to pay a vi&s;it to Lady Crowbery, and wou'd return to dinner.</P>
<P>Charged with this commi&s;&s;ion, Henry re|turned
<PB N="185" REF="188">
to the hall, where the lovely I&s;abella was &s;till waiting, and made his report. She expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf much alarmed by the tidings, not only on Lady Crowbery's account, who, &s;he feared, was in a very dangerous way, but on her father's al&s;o; &s;he declared there was nothing &s;he more dreaded than his interview with Lord Crowbery; his vi&s;its there were at all times unplea&s;ant, but much more &s;o on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, when, &s;he was &s;ure that cruel man would fly out into &s;ome violence, and, perhaps, &s;ay or do &s;omething &s;o very galling to her father's &s;pirit, as might draw him into a &s;erious quarrel; and what then would become of her! the mere po&s;&s;ibility of it was terrifying in the extreme.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Oh! this odious vi&s;it,"</Q> &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline">"wou'd it were well over! I cannot think of it without trembling."</Q></P>
<P>To the&s;e tremors and apprehen&s;ions Henry applied all the comfort his kind con&s;ideration for &s;uch generous feelings could &s;ugge&s;t: He promi&s;ed her he would take a hor&s;e, and ride over to Crowbery, on the pretence of vi&s;iting his friend Ezekiel, but, in fact, to be at hand for any &s;ervice that occa&s;ion might require; he begged her to re&s;t a&s;&s;ured that no attention
<PB N="186" REF="189">
&s;hould be neglected by him, where a life &s;o valuable to her, to him&s;elf, and to the world at large, was concerned; but as for any danger per&s;onally affecting her father, from the brutal manners of that da&s;tardly Peer, he held that in &s;overeign di&s;regard; he had &s;een enough of my Lord to know how far his in&s;olence could go, and where it would &s;top.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"He would fain,"</Q> added he <Q REND="inline">"have practi&s;ed it upon me, when he con&s;idered me as a wretched helple&s;s worm, that he might &s;afely tread upon; but no &s;ooner did he &s;ee that worm cou'd turn upon him, than he &s;hrunk back like a coward as he is, and in &s;pite of all his pride and haughtine&s;s, lower'd his high tone at the rebuke of a poor friendle&s;s being, whom he expected to have cru&s;h'd with a word."</Q></P>
<P>This con&s;olation &s;o effectually cheered the filial heart of the grateful I&s;abella, that &s;he re|a&s;&s;umed her &s;pirits, and with a &s;mile, that gave animation to a thou&s;and charms, expre&s;&s;ed her thanks with &s;o captivating a grace, that if Henry's heart, a&s;&s;ailed by &s;o many intere&s;ting &s;en&s;ations at once, was ju&s;t then in no humour to fulfil its &s;elf-denying re&s;olution, &s;ome ex|cu&s;e may be fairly offered for his tran&s;ient in|firmity of purpo&s;e.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I'll not leave &s;ight of

<P><Q REND="inline">"You are infinitely kind and indulgent to my weakne&s;s,"</Q> &s;aid I&s;abella; <Q REND="inline">"and I know your gallant &s;pirit is &s;uch, that every thing it protects mu&s;t be &s;afe; I will therefore di&s;mi&s;s my fears on my father's account;"</Q>&mdash;then ten|dering him her hand with a look of mode&s;t &s;weetne&s;s and benignity&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Fare you well,"</Q> &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall think them heavy hours till you both return; but I hope we &s;hall have a cheerful meeting at dinner time, and a plea|&s;ant walk in the evening."</Q>&mdash;With the&s;e kind words di&s;mi&s;s'd, he was going, when &s;he call'd him back, &s;aying&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"One word more before we part: I in&s;i&s;t upon your not taking that flighty animal you rode ye&s;terday; and if you will do me a particular favour, you will exerci&s;e my mare for me,"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall be in continual ter|ror,"</Q> replied Henry, <Q REND="inline">"lea&s;t any accident &s;hou'd befal her."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Judge then,"</Q> rejoin'd &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"of me by your&s;elf, and let your fears,

<HEAD>CHAPTER X. Symptoms of falling in Love.</HEAD>
<P>SIR Roger Man&s;tock had no &s;ooner &s;et out, attended by Henry on I&s;abella's favourite mare, when Zachary Cawdle &s;ummoned old Betty to the door, and at that in&s;tant recol|lected a &s;mall packet he had in charge from Lady Crowbery, to deliver to her &s;on: vexed at him&s;elf for his forgetfulne&s;s, he &s;aw no better way of redeeming his neglect, than by putting it into Mi&s;s Man&s;tock's hands, reque&s;ting her to give it to Henry on his return: he then took his leave, and departed, having a patient or two to vi&s;it by the way.</P>
<P>I&s;abella retired to her chamber; &s;he took up a book, opened it at random, run her eye over two or three pages, and threw it a&s;ide; &s;he was not in the humour for reading. Su&s;an
<PB N="189" REF="192">
was di&s;patched for her work-bag; &s;he rum|maged it for &s;omething to employ her&s;elf upon; nothing &s;uited her fancy, though &s;eve|ral things pre&s;ented them&s;elves to her choice; the bag fared no better than the book; both were di&s;carded.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am ju&s;t now,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he to Su&s;an, <Q REND="inline">"in that &s;ort of humour, when one can fix to nothing, and yet I want &s;omething to occupy me."</Q>&mdash;She then began to examine the little packet &s;he had in charge for Henry; &s;he could perceive that it contained a ring; it puzzled her to divine what Lady Crowbery could intend by &s;uch a pre&s;ent: &s;he put it into her pur&s;e, and for &s;ome minutes &s;at &s;ilent and thoughtful; then directing her eyes to Su&s;an, who was employing her&s;elf in &s;ome arrange|ments of the toilet, <Q REND="inline">"I am convinc'd,"</Q> &s;he cried, <Q REND="inline">"that Henry has an excellent heart. I begin to think, Su&s;an, that though it is a very fooli&s;h thing to fall in love, and every girl's duty to guard her&s;elf again&s;t &s;uch idle notions, yet in your ca&s;e, I can &s;uppo&s;e, it was hardly to be avoided, where you had &s;o many opportunities of knowing the good qualities of that engaging young man: it is not every body can be content only to admire and

approve a per&s;on and character like his."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I hope, Madam,"</Q> replied Su&s;an, <Q REND="inline">"you will not think the wor&s;e of me for owning that my heart is capable of love."</Q></P>
<P>The conference was now fairly opened; by Su&s;an, with a de&s;ign to probe the heart of her fair mi&s;tre&s;s; by I&s;abella, innocently, incauti|ou&s;ly, and with no other motive, but for the pre&s;ent relief of certain new and hitherto un|experienced &s;en&s;ations, of which &s;he neither knew the real nature or extent.</P>
<P>To Su&s;an's frank appeal above recited, &s;he candidly replied&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"No, no, I don't altoge|ther condemn you for being capable of love, but I am afraid you have be&s;tow'd your love upon one, who is not &s;u&s;ceptible of the like pa&s;&s;ion: I take Henry to have a mind &s;upe|rior to the weakne&s;s of liking any woman, but as a friend."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"To the weakne&s;s of liking me in any other light,"</Q> Su&s;an mode&s;tly replied, <Q REND="inline">"he is certainly &s;uperior; I know the little &s;ervices I did him in his di&s;tre&s;s are rated by him above their value, for he has a grateful and a feeling heart; too generous to treat me with unkindne&s;s, too &s;incere to deceive me with fal&s;e pretences; for what am I, to a&s;pire to a
<PB N="191" REF="194">
per&s;on of Mr. Henry's &s;ort, con&s;cious as I am that he is of high birth, with &s;uch talents, &s;o accompli&s;h'd, and with &s;o fine a per&s;on."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"He has indeed a very fine per&s;on,"</Q> repeated I&s;abella.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I have never &s;een his like,"</Q> re|&s;umed the other.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"But you your&s;elf are very hand&s;ome,"</Q> &s;aid the lady, &s;urveying her with a gracious &s;mile.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I hand&s;ome!"</Q> &s;aid the dam&s;el, affecting a &s;urpri&s;e at a compliment, which had been repeated to her a thou&s;and times; <Q REND="inline">"&s;urely, Madam, you are laughing at me; &s;uch a clowni&s;h girl as I am can have no charms for Mr. Henry"</Q>.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Did'n't I tell you,"</Q> &s;aid I&s;abella, <Q REND="inline">"he had no heart for love?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"It would he happy for him if he had not,"</Q> Su&s;an an&s;wered; <Q REND="inline">"for I am afraid his love is likely to produce nothing but &s;orrow and di&s;|appointment."</Q></P>
<P>I&s;abella eagerly demanded what &s;he meant&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Pardon me,"</Q> replied Su&s;an, <Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t not explain my&s;elf; neither &s;hou'd I have ventur'd to &s;ay a word on the &s;ubject, if I cou'd have conceiv'd what was &s;o plain to be &s;een cou'd have e&s;cap'd your notice.

all per&s;ons living you wou'd have been the la&s;t to doubt if he had a heart for love. Alas! he only loves too well for his future peace and quiet, and, I fear, he will live to rue the day that ever he came within the walls of Man|&s;tock Hou&s;e."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Heaven in its mercy forbid!"</Q> cried I&s;a|bella, <Q REND="inline">"that any thing &s;hou'd befal him in this hou&s;e, that might cau&s;e him to regret the coming into it!

<PB N="193" REF="196">
to."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"How &s;o! how &s;o!"</Q> exclaimed the faire&s;t of her &s;ex, her fine face glowing with blu&s;hes, and the tear of &s;en&s;ibility &s;tealing down her cheek, <Q REND="inline">"is he going from us? I wou'd not have him leave us for the world! what can he &s;ee in me, that &s;hou'd frighten him away?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Every thing that is lovely and engaging,"</Q> replied Su&s;an; <Q REND="inline">"that's out of all doubt. But when he &s;ees what he mu&s;t love, and cannot hope to obtain, if he has one grain of &s;pirit, which I think he does not want, he will e&s;cape whil&s;t he can, and not per&s;i&s;t to &s;tay, where every hour mu&s;t render him more fond and more unhappy."</Q></P>
<P>This was a conclu&s;ion that I&s;abella could not parry; it was an inference from her own a&s;&s;erted re&s;olution, which &s;he was not aware of, and could not an&s;wer: probably, if Su&s;an had not ju&s;t then reminded her of that unlucky re&s;olution, &s;he might have been as well plea&s;ed; and it is more than probable, had &s;he never let it pa&s;s her lips, this was not the very moment &s;he would have cho&s;en for imparting it; it was done, however, and I&s;abella was not &s;o regardle&s;s of con&s;i&s;tency as to revoke it; &s;he had made a vow, and vows are too &s;acred to be &s;ported with; &s;he could be &s;ilent, at lea&s;t, and cut &s;hort a
<PB N="194" REF="197">
conver&s;ation that &s;o plea&s;ingly had led her on into a dilemma &s;o embarra&s;&s;ing; this &s;he could do, and this &s;he did.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Fetch me my cloak,"</Q> &s;he cried; <Q REND="inline">"it is time for me to take my walk."</Q></P>
<P>Sir Roger Man&s;tock, in the mean while, fol|lowed by Henry on hor&s;eback, proceeded ra|pidly towards Crowbery; arrived there, he entered the ca&s;tle, whil&s;t Henry &s;truck off to|wards the cottage on the green, where Eze|kiel Daw &s;till &s;ojourned in pious attendance on the dying ju&s;tice. The good man was at home when Henry rode to the door, and re|ceived him with the greeting of a father to his &s;on.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Welcome, my dear child,"</Q> cried Ezekiel, as he took him by the hand; <Q REND="inline">"never tru&s;t me, but it maketh my heart glad to be|hold thee. Let it not be a wonder with thee, that I tarry here awhile, till it &s;hall plea&s;e the Lord to di&s;po&s;e of this wretched creature, lan|gui&s;hing on the bed of death, con&s;cience &s;trick|en, and wounded in the &s;pirit no le&s;s than in the fle&s;h. Thou may'&s;t well believe I have not fail'd to awaken him to a proper &s;en&s;e of his lo&s;t and de&s;perate condition: as his returns of rea&s;on are but &s;hort and rare, I have made the mo&s;t of them, and &s;et forth the heinou&s;ne&s;s

As death hovers over him momenta|rily, I have prepar'd his ears for the awful &s;ound of the la&s;t trump, and the dreadful warn|ing of eternal condemnation. Fain wou'd he have &s;natch'd at the vain hope of pardon and forgivene&s;s; but I told him not to flatter him|&s;elf with any &s;uch fallacious hopes; and that his offences again&s;t man mu&s;t fir&s;t be aton'd, before he thought of mercy from God: he appeal'd to his pre&s;ent &s;ufferings, and demand|ed of me, if I did not think they were pu|ni&s;hment &s;ufficient for all the crimes he had meditated or committed. I forbid him to draw any comfort from &s;uch fal&s;e per&s;ua&s;ions, reminding him, that mere pains and &s;ickne&s;s cou'd not expiate offences; that he was in|deed diverted from the perpetration of a mur|der by a &s;udden judgment, but it was the hand of Providence, and not his change of purpo&s;e, that had fru&s;trated that horrid de&s;ign; the crime remain'd with him, though the execution of it had been turn'd a&s;ide; I advis'd him, therefore, to &s;olicit your forgivene&s;s in the fir&s;t place."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"He need not doubt of that,"</Q> cried Henry, with eagerne&s;s; <Q REND="inline">"I heartily and from my &s;oul forgive him, and I be&s;eech you &s;o to a&s;&s;ure

nerves better brac'd, and a more manly nature, that can face affliction without whim|pering, do its bu&s;ine&s;s boldly, and wipe away the widow's tears with a &s;teady hand.

Blachford has been a tyrant and an oppre&s;&s;or all his life long; he has not felt for others, neither does he now; his feel|ings are for him&s;elf, and if he has any com|punction, his fears call it up; it is not volun|tary repentance; 'tis the dread of death, the remor&s;e of a thief at the gallows."</Q></P>
<P>Here Ezekiel &s;ung forth in his be&s;t key.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Let us not judge too har&s;hly,"</Q> cried Henry; <Q REND="inline">"Heaven only knows the hearts of men: we will leave Blachford to his con&s;cience, and turn our thoughts to a more intere&s;ting object.

<HEAD>CHAPTER XI. An angry Altercation with a Per&s;on unknown leads our Hero into imminent Danger.</HEAD>
<P>THESE pious and prudent re&s;olutions of our hero for renouncing his abode at Man&s;tock Hou&s;e, and following his mother to Li&s;bon, were not taken without a &s;truggle; for all complaints on the part of Lord Crowbery were more effectually avoided by his remain|ing with Sir Roger, in the ab&s;ence of the Lady, than by his leaving him, to which it could not fail, but that &s;u&s;picious conjectures would be affixed. This was a &s;taggering cir|cum&s;tance, and could hardly e&s;cape being &s;tated and oppo&s;ed to him by the ho&s;pitable Baronet, nay, perhaps, by I&s;abella her&s;elf, and of her powers of per&s;ua&s;ion, &s;hould &s;he exert them on the occa&s;ion, he had full &s;en&s;e and conviction; neither was it ab&s;olute de&s;pair, from which he was preparing to retreat; there was no repelling &s;phere about the lovely per|&s;on of I&s;abella; on the contrary, all was at|traction there, all was &s;weetne&s;s and &s;miles; &s;till, native honour, reverence for the feelings of a father, and a due &s;en&s;e of the young heire&s;s's

<P>Ezekiel had left him to the&s;e meditations, and was gone to the next door, hoping to find &s;ome opportunity of making Blachford ac|quainted with Henry's forgivene&s;s of his at|tempt again&s;t him. In the mean time a per&s;on entered the cottage, whom he recollected to be the finder of Lady Crowbery's ring: though he no longer pre&s;ented him&s;elf in the mean and humble dre&s;s he before appeared in, his coun|tenance was pale and &s;ickly, and his frame emaciated, yet there was &s;omething noble and impre&s;&s;ive in his air and deportment. After the ordinary &s;alutations, he de&s;ired to know if there was any me&s;&s;age or commi&s;&s;ion from Lady Crowbery. Henry informed him, that he had nothing of the &s;ort in charge. This was heard with &s;trong expre&s;&s;ions of &s;urprize. Some &s;mall acknowledgment, he owned, he did expect for his hone&s;ty; what did &s;he &s;ay upon the delivery of it?

<P><Q REND="inline">"I &s;tand in need of no apologies,"</Q> replied our hero, <Q REND="inline">"for defect of memory; I am clear in what I tell you, and having once a&s;&s;erted it, &s;hall repeat it no more, nor patiently &s;ubmit, that any que&s;tion &s;hould be made of my vera|city."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"You talk loftily, young Sir,"</Q> &s;aid the &s;tranger; <Q REND="inline">"and before we proceed any further in this kind of altercation, it will be proper for me to clear up &s;ome preliminary points between us, that may el&s;e involve you in a mi&s;take you may repent of.

I pre&s;ume, have deceiv'd you; from what I &s;aid to you at our la&s;t meeting, when I confid|ed to you the ring, you doubtle&s;s con&s;ider'd me as a needy abject man, and your&s;elf, then newly taken into favour by Lady Crowbery, as my &s;uperior; before you &s;uit your conver|&s;ation to that idea, I mu&s;t forewarn you, that you are talking with a gentleman."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am &s;orry for it,"</Q> replied Henry; <Q REND="inline">"as I cannot put up with tho&s;e &s;u&s;picions from a gentleman, which, in a vulgar per&s;on, I &s;hou'd have di&s;regarded: you talk'd to me of being return'd from tran&s;portation, and in &s;uch a man it was an unexpected merit to re&s;tore the pro|perty he had found; but what can a gentleman require more, than the &s;atisfaction of knowing, that the owner of the ring is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what &s;he had lo&s;t? This you are now inform'd of, and you mu&s;t prepare your mind, before we part, to di&s;mi&s;s every &s;hadow of doubt, that I could po&s;&s;ibly be guilty of a fal&s;e report."</Q></P>

it: the word, that pledges the honour of a gentleman to me, I &s;hall not di&s;pute; I am ready, to acquie&s;ce in it; but I am not willing to make a tender of my confidence to a per|&s;on, who exacts &s;uch high demands upon me, until I am convinc'd he is entitled &s;o to do; let us, therefore, interchange explanations with each other, before you require, or I render, &s;atisfaction for what you &s;eem to treat as an affront. Inform'd as I am, I am to con&s;ider you as a child of fortune, newly emerg'd from the lowe&s;t &s;tate of human wretchedne&s;s; your looks, your language and demeanour, certainly are not tho&s;e of a mean uneducated per&s;on; give me therefore your name, condition and preten&s;ions, and I will give you mine; then, if you tell me Lady Crowbery has receiv'd the ring I &s;ent her by your hands, and treated it as a bawble not worthy her remembrance, and the &s;ender of it as an object not de&s;erving her enquiry, I think I mu&s;t be compell'd, hard as it will be even then, to &s;ay that I believe you."</Q></P>
<P>Our Henry's candour &s;aw the rea&s;onablene&s;s of this &s;tipulation, and the dilemma was a very awkward one to which he was reduced by it; &s;en&s;ible that he could not ju&s;tly pre&s;s his requi&s;itions any further, yet unwilling to &s;ub|mit

to the indignity of being doubted&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I am not at liberty,"</Q> he replied <Q REND="inline">"to give you the information you require; I mu&s;t leave you, therefore, to draw your own conclu&s;ions, and we mu&s;t part, as we met, &s;trangers to each other. Your di&s;appointment about the ring certainly has an anxiety in it, that goes deeper than to the mere fact of my delivering it or not to the Lady Crowbery; but whatever my curio&s;ity on that account may be, I have no right to be inqui&s;itive as to your &s;ecrets, &s;o long as I withhold my own. When you appeal to the Lady, you will find I have told you truth; but I did not recollect to tell you, that &s;he never &s;aw the ring I gave her; it was wrapt in paper, and &s;he, being in ha&s;te, put it into her pocket without examination; if then there is any my&s;tery about it, and mere was annexed to it, than as a common trinket dropt from her finger, you have the &s;atisfaction of know|ing there was no time for her to develope it, neither have I &s;et eyes on her &s;ince."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is enough,"</Q> exclaimed the &s;tranger; <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;atisfied, completely &s;atisfied, and a&s;k your pardon for my he&s;itation in giving credit to you: had you told me this at fir&s;t, I &s;hou'd not have expre&s;s'd my&s;elf as I did."</Q></P>

I am not acquainted with Lord Crowbery, but I have had a glimp&s;e of his per&s;on, and &s;ome traits of his character; I own I cou'd not have &s;uppos'd Cecilia Adamant, one of the riche&s;t heire&s;&s;es, and mo&s;t accompli&s;h'd young women of her time, wou'd have conde&s;cended to the propo&s;als of &s;uch a &s;uitor."</Q>&mdash;Henry &s;aid, he &s;uppo&s;ed it was a match of her father's making, and &s;uch marriages, he ob&s;erved, were not apt to be happy.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="211"><Q REND="inline">"I can readily believe,"</Q> replied the &s;tranger, <Q REND="inline">"that her father forced this odious Lord upon her; for, if I am rightly inform'd of Sir An|drew's character, he was capable of &s;ome vio|lence, and not very well di&s;pos'd to con&s;ult his daughter's inclinations; &s;he, perhaps, might yield to his authority, and con&s;ent to be mi&s;erable for life, rather than di&s;obedient in any one act of it. From my &s;oul I com|pa&s;&s;ionate her! And now &s;he is dropping into a decline, and mu&s;t go to Li&s;bon; this I gather from the per&s;on him&s;elf, who advis'd it: mark, therefore, the i&s;&s;ue of the&s;e matches of com|pul&s;ion.

<HEAD>CHAPTER I. The Author hints at a Reform in the Con&s;titution of a Novel.</HEAD>
<P>IT is my wi&s;h to devote the&s;e &s;hort pre|fatory E&s;&s;ays to our fraternity of Noveli&s;ts, if haply my good will can &s;trike out any thing for their u&s;e and profit; it is, therefore, in the friendly &s;pirit of critici&s;m, that I prote&s;t again&s;t a practice, which &s;ome few of the corps have lately taken up, of adulterating their compo|&s;itions with a da&s;h of politics, which I con|ceive to be a kind of fraud upon their cu&s;|tomers, that not only brings di&s;grace and lo&s;s upon them&s;elves individually, but is injurious to the trade in general. I &s;hall not point out the particular offenders, as they are &s;ufficiently noted by tho&s;e, who have read their pro|ductions; and, if they have but wi&s;dom enough to reform, I &s;hould be loth that pa&s;t errors &s;hould be remembered to the prejudice of their future fortune.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="213">I tru&s;t, they need not be told, that there are clubs and coffee hou&s;es in this free country, where non&s;en&s;e may be talked with impunity; but it is a &s;erious ri&s;que to print it. Round their own fire-&s;ides their zeal may boil over without &s;calding their fingers; but when they cater for the public, they &s;hould be warned how they mix up any &s;uch inflammatory ma|terials, as temperate &s;tomachs will not bear; our only aim &s;hould be to refre&s;h our friendly vi&s;itors with an exhilarating whole&s;ome draught, not to di&s;turb their rea&s;on with an intoxicating nau&s;eous drug.</P>
<P>All that I am bound to do as a &s;tory-maker is, to make a &s;tory; I am not bound to reform the con&s;titution of my country in the &s;ame breath, nor even (Heaven be thanked!) to overturn it, though that might be the ea&s;ier ta&s;k of the two, or, more properly &s;peaking, one and the &s;ame thing in its con&s;equences.

<HEAD>CHAPTER II. A terrible Encounter, in which our Hero is totally di&s;comfited.</HEAD>
<P>WHILST our hero had been occupied at the cottage, Sir Roger had concluded his conference with Lord Crowbery. Nature had endowed the worthy Baronet with an even|ne&s;s of temper, that was a great &s;heather for the ill humours of tho&s;e he had to deal with. On this occa&s;ion, however, matters pa&s;&s;ed bet|ter than he had laid his account for; not that the conver&s;ation went off without &s;ome mut|terings on the part of the Peer, but they were &s;uch as rather &s;hewed his &s;ullenne&s;s than fero|city.</P>
<P>The reception given to Henry at Man&s;tock Hou&s;e was touched upon, with a kind of con|temptuous &s;neer at the weakne&s;s of Sir Roger for admitting &s;uch a gue&s;t.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"But perhaps,"</Q> added my Lord ironically, <Q REND="inline">"you find all tho&s;e charms in his elegant &s;ociety that my Lady your niece did; or, if you your&s;elf don't im|mediately di&s;cover them, your fair daughter perhaps may, for prejudices are apt to run in

families; and, I dare &s;ay the young gentleman well knows how to profit by &s;uch prejudices; but you, no doubt, have weighed the&s;e mat|ters well before you made an inmate of him."</Q></P>
<P>Sir Roger, who was no dealer in &s;ide &s;peeches and in&s;inuations, took little notice of this tra&s;h, and turned the &s;ubject to his niece's illne&s;s. My Lord replied, that &s;he was cer|tainly much indi&s;po&s;ed, for which, in fact, &s;he had to thank her&s;elf; that for his own part he had done, and &s;hould continue to do, every thing in his power for her recovery; change of climate had been &s;ugge&s;ted to him, and by authority he was much inclined to defer to. His neighbour Blachford had called down a very eminent &s;urgeon from London, and he had taken his advice in Lady Crowbery's ca&s;e; it was the very Mr. L&mdash;, who had made &s;o wonderful a cure of Sir George Revel, after his duel with <HI>Arundel</HI> in Flanders.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I con|fe&s;s to you,"</Q> &s;aid the Peer, <Q REND="inline">"I am charm'd with him; he talks to the under&s;tanding, and I comprehend what he means; but he will not let us decide on what he recommends without a reference to the faculty, and it &s;eems we are to have a con&s;ultation of phy&s;icians in London,
<PB N="220" REF="223">
who are either to pa&s;s their patient on to Li&s;|bon, or revoke the voyage, and take other mea&s;ures; &s;o the matter &s;tands at pre&s;ent; but if you wi&s;h to &s;ee your niece, &s;he will give you fuller information."</Q></P>
<P>Sir Roger &s;aid; it was what he much wi&s;hed and notice being given to Lady Crowbery, he was in&s;tantly and gladly admitted. To his great &s;urpri&s;e, he was &s;uffered to be alone with her; the moments were precious, and &s;he availed her&s;elf of them for putting a packet into his hands, containing her will, and other important papers, the &s;eal of which he was not to break but upon the event of her death.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You will find,"</Q> &s;he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"that I have made provi&s;ion for this unprotected youth, whom Ratcliffe's death has thrown upon my care; and if your candour ever &s;hall be &s;haken by the vile reports, that have been rais'd again&s;t my fame, you'll &s;ee &s;o full a confu|tation of them in that paper, that, however they may affect me living, dead, they cannot re&s;t upon my memory. Whether my Lord believ'd what he took pains to propagate I'll not pretend to &s;ay, but now at lea&s;t I can no longer be an object for his jealou&s;y, and, to do

him ju&s;tice, I mu&s;t own he has relax'd much of his &s;everity, which happy change I am in|debted for to the good offices of the gentle|man, who has been call'd in upon my ca&s;e: I &s;ee that he compa&s;&s;ionates my &s;ufferings, and I've rea&s;on to believe he gue&s;&s;es at the cau&s;e of them; I am told, he has had long &s;ittings with my Lord, and it is clear that he has gain'd an influ|ence over his bad humours, of which I happily experience the effects, witne&s;s the pre&s;ent mo|ments I enjoy with you; but we'll make pru|dent u&s;e of them, and not tre&s;pa&s;s on indul|gence &s;o precarious. Farewell; if I am de&s;|tin'd to Li&s;bon, and my Lord allows of it, I hope that we &s;hall meet once more."</Q>&mdash;Thus ended this affecting interview, Sir Roger part|ing with a heavy heart, encharged with many kind remembrances to I&s;abella and to Henry.</P>
<P>Our hero, who had kept watch upon Sir Ro|ger's departure, joined him as he came out of Lord Crowbery's gate, and, when he was clear of the park, at his reque&s;t, got into the chai&s;e, and gave his mare to one of the &s;ervants. Sir Roger's &s;pirits were &s;en&s;ibly affected, and it was &s;ome time before they were &s;ufficiently re|covered for him to enter upon a recital of what had pa&s;&s;ed, and a de&s;cription of the &s;tate, in which he found Lady Crowbery: it was not,
<PB N="222" REF="225">
however, his manner to paint in &s;trong colours, &s;o that all which Henry collected from this de&s;cription was, that his niece looked very ill, and was much altered &s;ince he had &s;een her la&s;t: of his interview with my Lord he &s;imply ob&s;erved, that it was a di&s;agreeable job well over; he was a man, he &s;aid, in who&s;e com|pany he was never at his ea&s;e; he dealt too much in dark hints and &s;ide blows to plea&s;e him, who had no ta&s;te for any talk but what went right onwards to the point before it.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"There is no pro&s;cription, however, again&s;t you,"</Q> &s;aid the Baronet; <Q REND="inline">"and if there was, perhaps I &s;hou'd not have regarded it, for I am too old to be dictated to in that &s;tyle, and told what company I am to keep. He is pleas'd to be con&s;iderate of my repo&s;e, and wou'd not be &s;orry to make me as jealous of my I&s;abella on your account, as he pretends to be of his own lady; but I can a&s;&s;ure you, Henry, &s;uch ab&s;urdities make no impre&s;&s;ion upon me, and I de&s;ire you will take no notice of it to my daughter. 'Tis true, Henry, you are a hand&s;ome fellow, and, I hope, in proper time, &s;ome hone&s;t girl may be of the &s;ame opinion, and make a man of you; but if my heart never aches till I&s;abella is in the fault of it, &s;orrow and I &s;hall never be acquainted
<PB N="223" REF="226">
more. Apropos to that,"</Q> added the Baronet with an encouraging &s;mile, <Q REND="inline">"here is my friend Claypole's niece coming to us this very day; Fanny is a fine girl, and, between you and me, has a hawk's eye at a hand&s;ome fellow; if you mind your hits, who knows what may come of it? She has a very pretty indepen|dency, I can promi&s;e you."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"And I am a beggar,"</Q> &s;aid Henry.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Not &s;o, not ab&s;o|lutely &s;o,"</Q> replied Sir Roger; <Q REND="inline">"I have that in my hands, which will keep off beggary at lea&s;t. I don't promi&s;e, nor wou'd I have you expect, any great matters; but I have my niece's word for &s;aying you are remember'd in her will, and that will is in my keeping, &s;o you won't be beholden to a wife for the bread that you eat, as &s;ome folks are."</Q></P>
<P>Henry was high-minded enough in con|&s;cience, and there were few people from whom he would have reli&s;hed this kind of di&s;cour&s;e; but he took the Baronet in his own way, and contented him&s;elf with ob&s;erving, that he was ill-qualified for a fortune hunter, for he &s;hould be as &s;crupulous with re&s;pect to the good qua|lities of a wife, and as indifferent to her money, as if he had the fortune of a prince in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion.</P>

<P><PB N="224" REF="229">They were now entering the avenue that opened to the hou&s;e, when Henry, &s;u&s;pecting that I&s;abella might be upon the look-out, and alarmed with the &s;ight of a led-hor&s;e, begged leave to &s;top the chai&s;e and get out. The mea&s;ure was a con&s;iderate one, for his pre&s;en|timent was verified by the &s;ight of that young lady walking towards them up the avenue: he galloped onwards, and greeting her with the good tidings, that all was well, &s;topt his career, and leapt to the ground in an in&s;tant of time; in the &s;ame in&s;tant joy illuminated her bright eyes, and glowed on her cheeks.</P>
<P>Oh! all ye Loves and Graces, what were you doing at that moment to make your fa|vourite, already mi&s;tre&s;s of poor Henry's heart, &s;o irre&s;i&s;tibly alluring, and why thus league your&s;elves in mighty combination again&s;t one weak &s;on of nature, unhappily too &s;en&s;itive for his repo&s;e?

<P>WE left our hero, at the clo&s;e of the fore|going chapter, like the &s;on of Tydeus in the fields of Troy, contending with the im|mortals: if in that encounter any lady got a wound of Henry's giving, we, who mu&s;t be tried by modern rules of honour, not by an|cient lore, will be the la&s;t to boa&s;t of it; cer|tain it is, that I&s;abella &s;tept into the carriage, and took her &s;eat there, with an agility that argued the free u&s;e of all her limbs; neither did &s;he fly to her father, as her fair prototype Venus did to Jupiter, to murmur and com|plain

of the audacious mortal who a&s;&s;ailed her; on the contrary, &s;he parted with him in peace, care&s;&s;ed the favourite &s;teed on which he rode, and, as &s;he mounted the chariot, accepted his a&s;&s;i&s;ting hand; from all which we infer, that I&s;abella came heart-whole out of the fray, or, at wor&s;t, with no &s;uch vi&s;ible injury as could impeach the manhood of our hero. He, on the other hand, whether di&s;abled by &s;ome &s;ecret wound, or from whatever cau&s;e, at|tempted not to vault into the &s;addle with his u&s;ual glee, but &s;lowly pacing under &s;helter of the trees with hor&s;e in hand, unfolded the &s;mall packet I&s;abella had delivered to him, and taking out the contents, which Zachary's carele&s;&s;ne&s;s had neglected to give, read as follows&mdash;</P>
<Q>Accept this ring: it was my gift to your father; the pledge of love and con&s;tancy: the per&s;on, who pretends to have found it, either is Delapoer him&s;elf, or can inform you of his fate.</Q>

in the cottage! Heaven and Earth! I might have been the murderer of my father! my blood chills at the reflection!

<P>Thus venting his &s;ad thoughts aloud, he &s;auntered towards the hou&s;e; and, there arrived, betook him&s;elf to his chamber, depo&s;ited the &s;acred pledge &s;ecurely, and was &s;ummoned from his meditations to the ta&s;k of dre&s;s by the tolling of the bell, which &s;olemnly an|nounced the arrival of a numerous party of vi&s;itors to the ho&s;pitable hou&s;e of Man&s;tock: the&s;e vi&s;itors, who were of the fir&s;t re&s;pect in the county, came uninvited; but though Sir Roger's liberal &s;tile of furni&s;hing his board defied &s;urpri&s;e, his table was not proof again&s;t their numbers, &s;o that Henry, who was late in his appearance, &s;haped his cour&s;e a&s;ide from the main body, and attached him&s;elf to a &s;up|plemental table, where &s;ate a young officer in a captain's naval uniform, who&s;e open coun|tenance and ea&s;y manners &s;oon unlocked re&s;traint, and put both parties at their mutual ea&s;e.</P>

<P>This officer, Cary by name, was nephew to Sir Roger, and younge&s;t of five &s;ons, which his &s;i&s;ter had borne to Sir Nicholas Cary, de|cea&s;ed. He was in per&s;on &s;hort, but of athletic mould, hard favoured in his features, which, though they could boa&s;t no beauty, made ample compen&s;ation by a &s;trong di&s;play of candour and benevolence; they needed not a herald to proclaim&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"this is an hone&s;t, brave, well temper'd man; him you may tru&s;t without a pledge, and take into your heart without a trial."</Q>&mdash;He was a prime favourite with his uncle, of which he had re|ceived many unequivocal proofs at times when pay run &s;hort, and prize money did not come in; and this very day had greeted his eyes with the Baronet's name at the foot of an order for an hundred pounds, together with an excellent time-keeper, pre&s;ented to him by the fair hands of his cou&s;in I&s;abella, which Clay|pole, who was a great martinette in things of that &s;ort, had procured for her in London for
<PB N="230" REF="235">
this very purpo&s;e. Captain Cary had lately been made po&s;t into a frigate, as a reward for his gallant behaviour in an action with the enemy, when he had command of a cutter; in this frigate he was now hovering upon the ea&s;tern coa&s;t for the purpo&s;e of collecting &s;ome pre&s;t men to complete his complement. His pre&s;ence &s;pread joy through the whole family; every one of the old &s;ervants, in their turns, made an errand to the &s;ide table, which was &s;oon overloaded with their offerings, for none came empty handed, and it had been a vain attempt to think of checking their good will; none went away without a kind word; and in all the&s;e manoeuvres Henry di&s;covered &s;uch a flow of heart on both &s;ides, that before many minutes had gone by, he and Cary had hatched a friend&s;hip for each other, which &s;ome bo&s;oms would have taken as many years to brood upon without the &s;ame effect.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am going to &s;ea in a whiff,"</Q> &s;aid Cary to our hero; <Q REND="inline">"but I was determin'd to &s;nap a &s;ight of my uncle and I&s;abella, if it was in my power, and con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;ervice: I have now brought my &s;hip to an anchor, by order of my &s;uperiors, and &s;hall be off to|morrow by peep of day"</Q>.&mdash;Henry a&s;ked how

<P>An opportunity &s;o tempting, and a com|panion &s;o much to Henry's ta&s;te, were not to be &s;lighted; it accorded &s;o critically with the project he had in mind, and &s;o fully met his wi&s;hes, that he told Cary in a whi&s;per, he would talk with him farther upon it in another place; and if a certain event came to pa&s;s as he expected, he &s;hould mo&s;t thankfully embrace his kind propo&s;al, and e&s;teem him&s;elf happy in carrying a mu&s;quet on his quarter deck, under &s;o gallant a commander. Henry, for rea&s;ons be&s;t known to him&s;elf, &s;poke this in &s;o low a voice, that it may be pre&s;umed he wi&s;hed it not to be overheard at the other table: whether it was or was not, time, perhaps, may &s;hew; but there was a glance ju&s;t then directed towards him from a certain per&s;on who there pre&s;ided,

<P>There was another per&s;on at table, though at &s;ome di&s;tance from the &s;ender of the glance in que&s;tion, who was not idle or indifferent in the intimations, which her eyes occa&s;ionally conde&s;cended to be&s;tow upon our hero. This was none other than Fanny Claypole her&s;elf, the niece of Sir Roger's reverend friend, and whom, as the reader may probably recollect, the worthy Baronet had charactered as an ac|curate ob&s;erver of beauty in the male &s;ex, and not unkindly di&s;po&s;ed, as it now &s;eemed, towards Henry, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it in &s;uch high perfection. She was &s;eated between her uncle and Sir Roger, but to the attention &s;he paid to either of them, or to any thing pa&s;&s;ing round or upon the table, &s;he might as well have been in another planet. Henry had all her notices, and nobody any &s;hare of her conver&s;ation. Her particular location as a &s;pectatre&s;s of what was to her &s;o intere&s;ting a phenomenon was as happy as good fortune could make it, for there was nothing to cut the line of vi&s;ion be|tween

her eyes and the object they were en|gaged upon, and tho&s;e eyes, which were truly very communicative, &s;ent &s;uch plain-&s;peaking me&s;&s;ages every now and then, that Henry mu&s;t have been duller than <HI>the fat weed on Lethe's brink</HI> not to have read their meaning; even Cary him&s;elf, who was not over-critical in this kind of language, wanted not the help of his &s;ea-gla&s;&s;es to &s;py it out&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Look to,"</Q> he cried, whi&s;pering Henry in the ear, <Q REND="inline">"by the lord, volunteer, there's a &s;ignal out for you to come on board the Fanny &s;loop of war: launch away, my brave fellow, for you'll have warm work when the decks are clear'd."</Q></P>
<P>Henry &s;miled, and &s;aid nothing; but the prediction was not a whit the le&s;s true for his di&s;regard of it; for no &s;ooner was the cloth removed, and grace pronounced by the Re|verend Mr. Claypole, than Fanny began her manoeuvres, and having introduced a chair between her&s;elf and uncle, &s;he beckoned Henry to her, and with a hitch that edged Mr. Claypole con&s;iderably out of the line, brought her prize clo&s;e along&s;ide of her, to the infinite delight of Cary, who calmly &s;eated him&s;elf in a more envied place, be&s;ide his cou&s;in I&s;abella.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IV. County Politics debated over a Bottle.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT I&s;abella had &s;urmi&s;ed was true: one of the county members lay at the point of death, and Sir Roger's vi&s;itors, who were the leading men of the oppo&s;ite parties, had united in referring them&s;elves to the worthy Baronet as a middle man, and ac|ceptable to both, for the &s;ake of pre&s;erving peace in the county, and preventing a conte&s;t, which, from the &s;tate and temper of parties, &s;eemed to be inevitable, unle&s;s he could be pre|vailed upon to &s;tep in upon the vacancy. This had been &s;o often tried before, and his aver&s;ion from the undertaking was &s;o well known, that though they came upon him in great &s;trength, and as it were by &s;urpri&s;e, yet they rather

laid their account for a hard-fought battle than an ea&s;y victory.</P>
<P>One of their junto, an elderly gentleman, and much re&s;pected, was Sir Roger's particular friend; he was accordingly put forward as their &s;poke&s;man in the opening of this bu&s;ine&s;s; he acquitted him&s;elf of the ta&s;k in a manner that did credit to their choice; he appealed to tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, in which he knew his friend was mo&s;t a&s;&s;ailable, the &s;pirit of patrioti&s;m, and the pride of being marked as the pre&s;erver of the public peace. Sir Roger, in plain words and few, made his hearty acknowledgments for the great honour conferred upon him, candidly &s;tated his unfitne&s;s for the office to which they in|vited him, and humbly &s;olicited to be excu&s;ed from undertaking it&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"My age,"</Q> &s;aid the good man, <Q REND="inline">"my habits of life, my attachment to the quiet character of a country gentleman, di&s;qualify me for the active duties you would lay upon me.

<P>Sir Roger &s;aid truly he was no adept in po|litics, neither was he ver&s;ed in &s;hifts and eva|&s;ions, which we take to be an inferior branch of the &s;ame &s;cience; where his con&s;cience, as in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, could not &s;tand by him, wit never came to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; in &s;hort, he was a good man and a bad orator; the&s;e argu|ments, therefore, which pu&s;hed right forwards at his heart he could not parry, and whil&s;t he was thus balancing the pro and the con in &s;i|lence, Cary, who &s;aw the conflict, and which &s;ide his honour ought to take, filled his gla&s;s, and cried aloud&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Come, uncle, let us drink, <Q REND="inline">'Peace at home and victory abroad;'</Q> if you'll pre&s;erve the one, we'll &s;truggle to obtain the other."</Q> This lucky &s;tart of gaiety was pledg|ed by all pre&s;ent, and Sir Roger &s;eemed to be

The victory was complete, and he gla&s;s began to circulate to the health of the Baronet; Captain Cary was in the chair, and the very &s;oul of good fellow&s;hip; the wine was excellent, the company in high good humour, and Sir Roger's courage began to rally; he had now his joke at his nephew Jack, and a whi&s;per for Henry at his elbow, which intimat|ed to him, that his prediction about Fanny was in a fair cour&s;e to be made good; in &s;hort, there was no one pre&s;ent who did not &s;eem to &s;ym|pathi&s;e in the fe&s;tivity of the moment.</P>
<P>When the gentlemen negotiators were three parts tip&s;ey, and their &s;ervants entirely &s;o, they &s;et out, at the ri&s;que of their necks, towards their re&s;pective homes. Henry and the Captain join|ed the ladies in the drawing-room, whil&s;t Sir Ro|ger, according to cu&s;tom, exerci&s;ed him&s;elf with a walk up and down the great hall with his friend Claypole: though a man in general of few words, he was ju&s;t now in a talking vein, and having gently tapped the par&s;on on the &s;houlder as if to be&s;peak attention, he began as follows:&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="246"><Q REND="inline">"Well, my good friend, the&s;e gentlemen have carried their point, with your a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and I am in a fair train to find my&s;elf, where I never expected to be found, a mute member in the Briti&s;h &s;enate, and the unworthy repre&s;enta|tive of this great country. Pr'ythee, Claypole, what do'&s;t think that I can do in that place? a pretty figure I &s;hall make; a mere country putt, among&s;t wits, lawyers, orators and poli|ticians.

he was a bold man, and call'd her a faint heart|ed woman in the face of the Hou&s;e, for which, by the way, &s;he tweak'd his no&s;e in the face of the Court, and call'd him cuckold. It was &s;curvy treatment, and, I am apt to think, gave the orator a &s;urfeit, that has run in the blood ever &s;ince; for all our generations in de&s;cent from Sir Thomas have been as mute as fi&s;hes to the pre&s;ent day."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, Sir Roger,"</Q> &s;aid Claypole, <Q REND="inline">"there have been times &s;ince tho&s;e of Elizabeth, when taciturnity was a good family qualification, and that &s;ame royal tweak of the no&s;e may have been the means of keeping &s;ome heads upon their &s;houlders: after all, it mu&s;t be own'd, it was a rough way her Maje&s;ty took of &s;nub|bing the good man Sir Thomas, and what few old maids in the like ca&s;e wou'd have done; but match-making for crown'd heads is a tick|li&s;h bu&s;ine&s;s,"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"For any heads,"</Q> added, Sir Roger; <Q REND="inline">"and tho' a matter of that &s;ort may, for aught I know, be going on at this very moment under our no&s;es, I &s;hall keep mine at lea&s;t out of danger, as I &s;hou'd be loth to have it tweak'd, even by the fair fingers of Fanny Claypole."</Q></P>
<P>This was a hit that Claypole had not quite
<PB N="243" REF="248">
given his friend credit for, and it was at lea&s;t a proof to him that his own remarks had not been &s;ingular; for he argued rightly enough, that if Sir Roger had &s;pied it out, nobody could have overlooked it; he thought it be&s;t therefore to treat it in the &s;ame &s;train, between je&s;t and earne&s;t, and ob&s;erved in reply, that Fanny was a free-hearted girl, and her own mi&s;tre&s;s.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"She is out of my hands,"</Q> &s;aid he; <Q REND="inline">"&s;o &s;hou'd not I be out of her's with a whole &s;kin, if I was to play the part of Sir Thomas Man&s;tock, and dictate to her on the &s;ubject of matrimony. Henry is a fine fellow, it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, and it is no impeachment to her ta&s;te that &s;he likes him; if, therefore, &s;he is re&s;olv'd to make him a pre&s;ent of fifteen thou&s;and pounds and her fair per&s;on, much good may it do him; I can't gain&s;ay it."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"And if it was to come to that,"</Q> &s;aid Sir Roger, <Q REND="inline">"it might not, perhaps, be the very wor&s;t thing &s;he could do: I have a very high opinion of Henry, and tho' we are in the dark about his p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">rents, I would ri&s;que a wager that my niece Crowbery knows him to be a very hone&s;t man's &s;on, and one for who&s;e memory &s;he has a great regard; and as a proof of it, friend Claypole, I can tell you in confi|dence, that Henry will be well provided for at

<P>Claypole was a man that looked to the main chance, and not a word of this was lo&s;t upon him: his eyes had not been idle, whil&s;t Fanny's were employed with Henry; he knew her well, and had had a painful tru&s;t whil&s;t &s;he had been under his guardian&s;hip; he &s;aw her daily in danger of being made the prey of the fir&s;t &s;ightly knave that laid his traps for her; he had as high an opinion of our young hero as Sir Roger him&s;elf had, and was in the &s;ame per&s;ua&s;ion, as to his being the &s;on of Ratcliffe; believing al&s;o that he was in a fair train &s;hortly to become his nephew, he was by no means &s;orry to hear of Lady Crowbery's intentions in his favour. Upon the&s;e grounds he not only became reconciled to the nece&s;&s;ity he was under of leaving his niece to her own choice, but was &s;ecretly di&s;po&s;ed to further the connection by all the means in his power: all the&s;e thoughts he kept to him&s;elf, and quietly followed his friend Sir Roger to the drawing-room.</P>

<P>WHEN Sir Roger and his friend entered the apartment of the ladies, they found the young people di&s;tributed into pairs; Cary in high talk, and &s;itting by his cou&s;in; Henry in no talk at all, but fairly pounded in a corner of the room by the manoeuvre of Fanny Claypole, who was &s;o po&s;ted as to cut him off from all chance of an e&s;cape: &s;he had &s;eated her&s;elf in a chair with her back to one &s;ide of the room and her knees to the other, &s;o as to form the exact hypotheneu&s;e of a triangle, and Henry in the area of it.

<P>Something or other had di&s;compo&s;ed I&s;a|bella's &s;pirits, and all Cary's efforts could not rally them. The pre&s;ence of her father was a relief to her, and, upon his entrance, Henry &s;tarted from his corner, and joined the circle; Claypole placed him&s;elf next to him, and drew him into talk about Blachford and his trepan. Henry, with a good deal of humour, related Ezekiel's account of that gentleman's &s;tate of con&s;cience, and his mode of comforting him on the bed of &s;ickne&s;s. Claypole ob&s;erved upon this with &s;ome degree of a&s;perity, and hinted, that he &s;hould con&s;ider Ezekiel as a dangerous enthu&s;ia&s;t among&s;t his pari&s;hioners.

<P>Hearts ea&s;ily impre&s;&s;ed with &s;udden pa&s;|&s;ions are generally communicative; Fanny Claypole's was of this &s;ort; prone to love at fir&s;t &s;ight, and not in the practice of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing her emotions, &s;he had given Henry pretty clearly to under&s;tand that he was not indifferent to her. This &s;he contrived to convey to him, during their conference in the corner, through the channel of more &s;en&s;es than one, and though they were not all ju&s;t then in the cleare&s;t &s;tate of apprehen&s;ion, none were &s;o di&s;abled as to lo&s;e their functions. The fondne&s;s of a fine woman never can, nor ever ought to be treated with indifference and contempt; neither was it in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance. This gallantry, &s;o in|di&s;pen&s;ible on the part of Henry, confirmed her in the full per&s;ua&s;ion, that the impre&s;&s;ion was reciprocal, &s;o that when her uncle afterwards took occa&s;ion, as they were pa&s;&s;ing to the &s;up|per room, civilly to &s;ubmit to her in a whi&s;per,
<PB N="251" REF="256">
if &s;he was not a little too particular with a new acquaintance, &s;he an&s;wered him in the true &s;pirit of independence, that he need not con|cern him&s;elf about appearances, &s;he and her new acquaintance, as he called him, perfectly under&s;tood each other. This, though &s;ome|thing more than &s;he was warranted to &s;ay, was no more than &s;he thought prudent to a&s;&s;ert, by way of check to any objections, which &s;he was prepared to expect from that cautious quarter. For I&s;abella &s;he had another language; from her &s;he expected no oppo&s;ition, and dreaded no rival&s;hip; but there was an innate delicacy of character in that amiable young lady, which made it nece&s;&s;ary for Fanny to conform to it, in appearances at lea&s;t, and &s;he was &s;en&s;ible that the levity of her behaviour &s;tood in need of &s;ome &s;oftening and apology, for &s;he had not been &s;o totally engro&s;&s;ed by her own pur|&s;uits, as not to perceive that I&s;abella did not entirely approve her proceedings in the corner. She followed her therefore into her dre&s;&s;ing room, when they retired for the night, and as &s;oon as Su&s;an was &s;ent away, the en&s;uing conver&s;ation took place:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I can &s;ee by your looks,"</Q> &s;aid Fanny, <Q REND="inline">"that I am out of favour with you; you think
<PB N="252" REF="257">
I have behav'd like a fool, and expos'd my&s;elf, I know you do; but, dear &s;weet &s;oul, don't turn that grave countenance upon me, but hear, and pity me, and be my friend. I confe&s;s to you, I never was &s;o taken by &s;urpri&s;e in all my life. I know what young men in general are, and how cautious we ought to be in our behaviour towards them; but you never told me that I was to behold what I did not believe was in nature, and &s;o my poor heart, being caught in an unguarded moment, and not be|ing made of either flint or &s;teel, cou'd not &s;tand the &s;hock, but, alas for me! was overthrown in the end; not at fir&s;t, do you mark me; for, hand&s;ome as he is, if he had been only that, I could have look'd upon him as one does upon a picture, and thought no more about him; but the misfortune is, he is &s;o irre&s;i&s;tibly engaging withal, that it requires either more in&s;en&s;ibility, or more hypocri&s;y than I am mi&s;tre&s;s of, to pre|vent his finding out how agreeable he is to me: now I dare &s;ay you &s;ee him with other eyes than I do, and think all this very filly, and per|haps it is not very wi&s;e; but upon my life, my dear, I find it very natural."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Whether I &s;ee Henry exactly with the &s;ame eyes that you do,"</Q> replied I&s;abella, <Q REND="inline">"is

<P><Q REND="inline">"Well,"</Q> an&s;wer'd &s;he, <Q REND="inline">"you are always too wi&s;e for me; and yet I am per&s;uaded, if you &s;aw me in any danger, you have too much good nature not to guard me again&s;t it. If man was &s;uch a mon&s;ter as &s;ome old maids make him to be, you, who are far enough out of his reach, wou'd not &s;uffer me to be devour'd by him. If Love be not harmle&s;s, why do they de&s;cribe him as a child?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"When I have been taught Love's catechi&s;m,"</Q> quoth I&s;abella, <Q REND="inline">"I may be able to an&s;wer your que&s;tion; at pre&s;ent I know nothing about it;

<P>To this the fair morali&s;t gravely an&s;wered&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Never, Fanny, will Henry, or any other man of honour, lo&s;e his re&s;pect whil&s;t you pre|&s;erve your dignity.

on his part, was he di&s;pos'd to entertain it, throws him at &s;uch a di&s;tance, that he can only regard you with an awful re&s;pect.

<P>Whil&s;t Fanny rea&s;oned in this manner, it was as much as I&s;abella's politene&s;s could do to attend with patience the conclu&s;ion of her argument, upon the very fir&s;t pau&s;e &s;he in|terpo&s;ed by replying,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"When you labour to convince me that I am in no danger with a per&s;on of Henry's &s;ort, you do but argue to a&s;&s;ure me, that when the &s;un gives his light I am not in the dark; but when you wou'd a&s;|&s;ign other cau&s;es of my &s;ecurity, than what

are to be found &s;imply in his honour, your argument becomes more ingenious than &s;olid, becau&s;e there needs not more than one good and &s;ufficient rea&s;on for any one thing. As for that awful re&s;pect, which you a&s;cribe to him, as applicable to my rank and fortune compar'd with his own, believe me, Fanny, I am not likely to exact, nor he to pay it, on that account; if he gives as much as my be|haviour merits, be a&s;&s;ur'd he adds nothing on the &s;core of tho&s;e worldly advantages fortune has for the pre&s;ent thrown into my &s;cale, and which &s;he may have in re&s;erve for his in an equal or &s;uperior degree; I de&s;ire, therefore, to be under&s;tood as owing no &s;ecurity to tho&s;e in&s;urmountable barriers, which you fancy you di&s;cover between us, but which are as imagi|nary as the exemption that you flatter me with &s;uppo&s;ing I enjoy by nature from the com|mon weakne&s;&s;es of my &s;ex, or the re&s;olution you credit me for having fix'd &s;o immoveably again&s;t all &s;uitors, becau&s;e I have declin'd the tenders of &s;ome. If there is an imputation that wou'd wound me deeper even than the charge of levity and coquetry, it is that of being thought a proud de&s;pi&s;er of tho&s;e be|neath

my level, and in&s;en&s;ible of &s;oul to merit in an humble &s;tate of fortune.

<HEAD>CHAPTER VI. Love is a &s;ubtle Arguer.</HEAD>
<P>WE who are hi&s;torians of fiction have a privilege that hi&s;torians of fact do not enjoy, which, like the ring of Gyges, gives us the power of invi&s;ibility, by which we in&s;inuate our&s;elves mo&s;t completely into the &s;ecrets of our heroes and heroines, and in&s;tead of arguing, as our unendowed brethren do, from records and authorities, up to the thoughts and cha|racters of our actors, which at be&s;t is but an uncertain kind of gue&s;s-work, we can go point-blank to their hearts, in &s;pite of all the obliquities of words and actions, and give to our readers the idea in embryo before it has been brought to the birth, or ever mounted to the lips. In virtue of this privilege I &s;hall let Fanny Claypole go, as her meditations may ea&s;ily be gue&s;&s;ed at, and remain with the lovely I&s;abella, who&s;e thoughts are proba|bly more deep, and undoubtedly more inte|re&s;ting.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he was alone, &s;he began to take a &s;trict review of what had been her &s;tate of
<PB N="260" REF="265">
mind and temper during the foregoing &s;cene: the fir&s;t reflection that occurred to her was of the &s;elf-accu&s;ing &s;ort; &s;he had acted with du|plicity.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Have I not permitted Fanny to conclude that Henry is indifferent to me? and is he?"</Q>&mdash;To this her heart replied that he was not. Her next reproach was for the coldne&s;s and re&s;erve with which &s;he had met the warmth of Fanny's friendly confidence:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I hate my&s;elf for that,"</Q> &s;he &s;aid; <Q REND="inline">"it looks &s;o like what I dete&s;t and di&s;avow, pride and di&s;dain."</Q>&mdash;Here &s;he pau&s;ed, and began to call over, as near as memory enabled her, the very words &s;he had u&s;ed in her pa&s;t di&s;cour&s;e with her friend. Her faults did not appear &s;o glar|ing upon this review; her &s;ilence with, re&s;pect to Henry did not &s;trike her as &s;o direct a breach of that frank &s;incerity which was her nature; &s;he did not &s;ee the obligation &s;he was under to make di&s;covery of impre&s;&s;ions, the reality of which &s;he was not yet a&s;&s;ured of: why &s;hould Fanny's levity, who &s;aid every thing at random that was uppermo&s;t in her thoughts, draw her into the like idle vein of talking?&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"If &s;he will pronounce upon my in&s;en&s;ibility, it is not I that lead her into the mi&s;take, nor am I &s;ure it was my bu&s;ine&s;s to lead her out

<P>Ah I&s;abella! dear ingenuous girl, you &s;ee the point which honour fain would reach, but do not &s;ee the interpo&s;ing pa&s;&s;ion that diverts it from his cour&s;e. This night you mu&s;t wear out in &s;leeple&s;s meditations; within the region of your heart there's one at work, who&s;e in|novating &s;pirit never re&s;ts till it has perplexed the rea&s;on, overturned the peace, tampered with the loyalty, and &s;hook the bo&s;om's lord upon his throne. Love is that &s;ubtle dark in|cendiary, which unexperienced candour has no guard again&s;t: he wears a &s;oft alluring &s;mile, flatters in gentle whi&s;pers, wooes you to plea|&s;ure, vexes you with no complaint, is &s;ocial, gay, familiar, void of care; charmed by his artful approaches you admit him of your parties, make him your inmate, and lodge him in your bo&s;om; then the turmoil begins, then all his &s;pecious qualities are &s;een no more; un&s;ocial, murmuring, di&s;contented, he begins to brood upon his &s;chemes, &s;hunning the face of man

and day, renouncing food and &s;leep, hiding him&s;elf in dark and &s;olitary places, till all is anarchy, mi&s;rule and madne&s;s, to the de&s;truc|tion both of heart and brain.</P>
<P>Ah I&s;abella! dear ingenuous girl, there was a time when you would have entertained this openne&s;s of heart, this frank confe&s;&s;ion of your friend with heart as open, confidence as frank; you would have given her warm di&s;intere&s;ted pa&s;&s;ion then a noble name, encouraged it with your applau&s;e, promoted it with all your power; but jealou&s;y, that fierce and active parti&s;an of love, will not permit the&s;e energies of native genero&s;ity to have their play; it is a monopo|lizing mi&s;er that will let no partner have an intere&s;t in that &s;take at which it &s;ingly gra&s;ps, and often, in the zeal of competition, overrates the prize which it would fain engro&s;s.&mdash;This probably was not its error in the ca&s;e of Henry; but though the rival&s;hip of Fanny could not ea&s;ily give more than its true value to the object in di&s;pute, yet, doubtle&s;s, it ex|cited &s;en&s;ations in I&s;abella's bo&s;om, which, had they not been &s;tirred &s;o roughly, might have enjoyed a longer calm; the pa&s;&s;ion, which &s;he &s;aw reflected from the fond eyes of Fanny, quickened her curio&s;ity to &s;crutinize the en|gaging
<PB N="264" REF="269">
form on which tho&s;e eyes were fixed; &s;he followed them to the attracting point, and there &s;he found enough to warrant all that rap|ture and delight with which they &s;eemed in&s;pired; &s;he &s;aw the art with which Fanny had po&s;ted her&s;elf, heard the murmur of her voice in &s;oft and tender tones, and marked the animation of her action, her &s;tarts, and titterings, and co|quetries, to all which &s;he gave meaning and matter as her fancy dictated. This was the &s;tate of her mind, whil&s;t Cary's railleries, once &s;o entertaining, di&s;tracted her attention, and Fanny was enjoying her triumph, till her father's pre&s;ence drew Henry from his corner, and di&s;&s;olved the &s;pell.</P>
<P>If the gentle I&s;abella, with a heart thus agi|tated, fell &s;hort in any degree of her wonted candour towards Fanny, either during her con|ver&s;ation with her, or in the cour&s;e of her re|flections that en&s;ued upon it, let any who have experienced &s;imilar &s;ituations arraign her if they can.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VII. The Hero of our Hi&s;tory is brought to Shame.</HEAD>
<P>THERE was a gallery in this quarter of the hou&s;e, which had a communication with &s;everal of the apartments, and among&s;t
<PB N="269" REF="274">
others with that which Fanny Claypole oc|cupied. Here &s;he was met by Henry, as &s;he was going to her chamber &s;ome time after her conference with I&s;abella. We confe&s;s it does not &s;et off the gallantry of our hero, that he would fain have contented him&s;elf with civilly bidding her good night, and &s;o have pa&s;&s;ed onwards to his bed-room, which al&s;o opened into the afore&s;aid gallery. There were other modes of di&s;po&s;ing of time, to Fanny's mind in its pre&s;ent &s;tate, more grateful than that of devoting it to &s;olitude and &s;leep. She con|trived to hold him in parley &s;ome few minutes, and in that &s;hort &s;pace of time the &s;torm fore&s;een by I&s;abella took place; the winds began to howl, the lightnings fla&s;hed, and the thunder rolled.</P>
<P>Fanny's gentle &s;pirits in&s;tantly took alarm; her terrors deprived her of the power of &s;tirring from the &s;pot on which &s;he &s;tood; &s;he clung clo&s;e to Henry, cla&s;ping him with both arms, and &s;eeming to &s;upplicate protection in the mo&s;t piteous manner. It was in vain he en|couraged her to lay a&s;ide her fears, that the bur&s;t was over, and the &s;torm had &s;pent its fury; &s;he was &s;ure there would be more of it; &s;he did not dare to move; and &s;he implored
<PB N="270" REF="275">
him not to leave her; thunder had always &s;uch an effect upon her, that it would throw her into fits if &s;he had not &s;omebody to &s;upport her, and as for her own &s;ervant, (whom he offered to call to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance) &s;he was to the full as mere a coward as her&s;elf, and totally helple&s;s. What could he do, but cheer the frighted fair one, who re&s;orted to his courage for protection in this extremity? Another bur&s;t &s;ucceeded, the thunder louder and the fla&s;h more vivid. Fanny's arms now &s;trained him clo&s;er than before; &s;he dropt her head upon his neck, and hid her face; &s;he &s;hook in every limb, and murmuring cried&mdash;Support me, or I &s;hall drop!&mdash;When the &s;en&s;es are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by fear, all re&s;erve cea&s;es, nay, even delicacy it&s;elf; we cling to the mo&s;t loath&s;ome object that gives us &s;helter from the face of danger. If Fanny's terrors were proportionable to the eagerne&s;s with which &s;he embraced her &s;upporter, they were &s;trong indeed. Henry was not &s;orry to &s;ee a couch conveniently within reach, on which he could depo&s;it his fair burthen, which now indeed was become a very pre&s;&s;ing and im|portunate concern; her knees &s;eemed &s;inking under her, and as &s;he hung upon his neck with
<PB N="271" REF="276">
her whole weight, he began to think the fit &s;he had predicted was actually upon her; he took her in his arms, and placed her carefully, and with all due delicacy, on the couch; as &s;he &s;till kept her hold upon him, of nece&s;&s;ity he was drawn down upon the &s;eat be&s;ide her.</P>
<P>The &s;torm went on, the pitile&s;s elements relaxed not of their fury, and poor affrighted Fanny, trembling more than ever, faintly whi&s;|pered, &s;ighing the whil&s;t mo&s;t movingly&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Deare&s;t of men, what will become of me? &s;helter me, I be&s;eech you, from this &s;cene of terror."</Q>&mdash;As the flitting wheatear huddles her|&s;elf under the turf whil&s;t the gathering clouds hang threatening over her head, and ca&s;t a gloom upon the earth, &s;o did the like timorous dam&s;el, under the protection of her courageous defender, gazing on him with uplifted eyes that prayed for pity on her di&s;con&s;olate con|dition, and encircling him in her arms, whil&s;t &s;he &s;oftly murmured&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Oh Henry! let the lightning &s;trike me now; within your arms I die content."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh Henry!"</Q> honour al&s;o cried, <Q REND="inline">"awake and be your&s;elf! whither are you ru&s;hing? break from her hold; e&s;cape from her &s;nares; they are &s;pread for your de&s;truction; the mo|ment
<PB N="272" REF="277">
is on the wing that wafts you to per|petual di&s;grace. Ra&s;h, heated youth! accur&s;ed power of wine, that thus inflames the blood and blinds the eye of rea&s;on: can you not &s;ee the&s;e terrors are but counterfeit, panders to pa&s;&s;ion? the &s;torm that you &s;hould dread is in your veins, not in the elements; awake, and &s;ave your&s;elf!"</Q></P>
<P>What &s;hall we &s;ay? Mu&s;t we break Na|ture's mould, and fa&s;hion an imaginary hero of purer matter than of earthly clay, &s;etting up a phantom of perfection, without &s;peck or ble|mi&s;h, for enthu&s;ia&s;tic ignorance to wonder at? Is it to &s;hew man as he is, or only as he ought to be, that we compo&s;e this hi&s;tory? Surely as he is; we make not men by working in our clo&s;ets, but take them ready made from the world's mighty warehou&s;e, and pre&s;ent them as we found them; therefore, as the hand of na|ture guides my pen, &s;o do I write, and here con&s;ign my hero to as much di&s;grace as im|purity in meditation, not in act, may in the judgment of my candid readers &s;eem to me|rit: virtue had lo&s;t its hold upon his heart, honour's appeal was &s;ilenced, and mode&s;ty had turned away her face from the &s;u&s;picicus &s;cene, when in the very moment as he ho|vered
<PB N="273" REF="278">
on the brink of ruin, a &s;udden &s;cream from I&s;abella's chamber &s;natched him from his fate; her door flew open, and behold the very form of loveline&s;s in fear's mo&s;t &s;triking at|titude! Swift as the lightning's glance our hero &s;tarted from the couch, &s;hook off the embrace that bound him like a &s;pell, and, deaf to Fanny's &s;cream, flew to the re&s;cue of the trembling I&s;abella.</P>
<P>Fear had not &s;o far robbed her of her &s;en&s;es, but that &s;he had &s;ufficient faculties to note the &s;ituation of the parties, whom her pre&s;ence had &s;o critically broken in upon. In&s;tant aver&s;ion &s;eized her heart, and &s;uper&s;eded the le&s;s ur|gent &s;en&s;e even of fear it&s;elf: &s;he was at once indignant and compo&s;ed; &s;o that when Henry, in a faultering voice, begged to know what alarmed her, &s;he turned di&s;dainfully away, and in a tone that pierced him to the heart, bade him pay his attentions where they were more wanted and more welcome, then ha&s;tily re|turned into her chamber, and locked the door.</P>
<P>A long and di&s;mal &s;ilence en&s;ued between the parties in the gallery. Fanny remained &s;eated on the couch, her dre&s;s di&s;ordered, her looks wild, and her attitude that of a Sybil in
<PB N="274" REF="279">
her phren&s;y. Henry &s;tood motionle&s;s, con|founded, the very &s;tatue of de&s;pair and horror.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I am undone!"</Q> cried Fanny, <Q REND="inline">"I&s;abella has di&s;covered us; &s;he has the eyes of a lynx, and nothing now remains to &s;ave me from di&s;|grace and ruin, but boldly to join hands this moment, and defy the world."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Mi&s;s Clay|pole,"</Q> &s;aid Henry, <Q REND="inline">"I hold my&s;elf in honour bound to make you every reparation that you can require; I only wi&s;h you to con&s;ider, if the mode you point at is not de&s;perate in the ex|treme: I am but what I am, and that is, no|thing; in this hou&s;e I will not pa&s;s another day; worlds would not tempt me to encounter the cha&s;te eyes of that offended lady; before you make &s;o ra&s;h a &s;acrifice, therefore, recol|lect it is only to appearances you would make it, and that your con&s;cience does not plead to facts, thank Heaven!"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Thank Heaven for what?"</Q> &s;he eagerly demanded; <Q REND="inline">"not for the interruption that her jealou&s;y occa&s;ion'd; not for the &s;hock that &s;he has given to my tor|tur'd nerves: it is not that I blu&s;h at what has pa&s;s'd, or any thing that might have pa&s;s'd, but only that &s;he knows it. No, Henry, when I took you in my arms, I bound my heart to you by vows as &s;acred as if pledg'd before the altar;
<PB N="275" REF="280">
favours be&s;tow'd on you I never can regret; they are &s;anctify'd by honour; they are en|dearments &s;natch'd by opportunity from the cold lingering forms of law; the overflowings of a heart that doats upon you, who&s;e pride it is to give you proofs of boundle&s;s confidence:&mdash;Here is my hand; take it, Henry, and with it take a hu&s;band's right in all that this fond heart and devoted per&s;on can be&s;tow; we do but borrow a few hours from time."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not &s;o,"</Q> cried Henry, <Q REND="inline">&s;tepping back; not in this tumult of your mind will I avail my&s;elf of an extorted &s;acrifice, and take your hand. I do mo&s;t re&s;olutely bar the agreement till the event is &s;een. Mark what Mi&s;s Man&s;tock does; our fate is in her hands alone; if by her means (which I am &s;low to &s;u&s;pect) the &s;tory gets abroad, and that your fame requires it, I &s;hall be at hand; and here I &s;olemnly engage my honour to come forth upon your &s;ummons, whether it be to confute fal&s;hood and exaggera|tion at the ri&s;k of my per&s;on, or to repair your injuries by marriage, if this you &s;hall require; and from this promi&s;e no temptation, be it what it may, &s;hall make me &s;werve."</Q></P>
<P>With the&s;e words he departed, leaving her to bewail her di&s;appointment, and murmur out
<PB N="276" REF="281">
reproaches for his coldne&s;s, amid&s;t tears, and &s;ighs, and &s;leeple&s;s to&s;&s;ings in a &s;olitary bed. As for his mind, it felt a &s;tab in every thought; one fatal lap&s;e had &s;unk him in his own e&s;|teem; and in the promi&s;e he had made to Fanny, every hope that could a&s;pire to I&s;a|bella was for ever buried. Not daring to en|quire the cau&s;e of her alarm, he conjectured that it mu&s;t have been created by the &s;torm, and &s;aw, with &s;ome degree of con&s;olation, that it now was pa&s;t. Captain Cary was to return to his &s;hip by the very fir&s;t of the morning, and had kept his chai&s;e and po&s;t-hor&s;es waiting for that purpo&s;e; and as immediate retreat from Man&s;tock Hou&s;e was Henry's fixt re|&s;olve, the opportunity was fair for taking him and his baggage off at once, before the family was &s;tirring. Their road fortunately laid through Crowbery, which was &s;omething more than half way; it was po&s;&s;ible, therefore, that Cary's time might allow of a &s;hort call at Ezekiel's or Zachary's hou&s;e, where &s;ome information might be gained of Lady Crowbery's de&s;tina|tion, and if that &s;hould turn out to be for Li&s;|bon, all was &s;o far well, if his new friend would &s;tand to his offer of tran&s;porting him thither. It was nece&s;&s;ary, however, to take a proper

leave of Sir Roger; and for this purpo&s;e he immediately wrote the following letter, ad|dre&s;&s;ed to that worthy per&s;onage:</P>

<P>Su&s;an had been &s;o ob&s;ervant of Henry's in|junctions, that &s;he had not named him to her mi&s;tre&s;s, and that young lady being equally &s;ilent, his departure was as much a &s;ecret to her as to Fanny. I&s;abella had pa&s;&s;ed a wretched night; her dread of meeting Henry was ex|treme; &s;he gave little ear to Fanny's palliating account; and, with a mind agonized between love and re&s;entment, &s;he came trembling down the &s;tairs; at the foot of them Su&s;an was &s;tanding, her eyes drenched with tears, and a paper in her hand, that had ju&s;t been deli|vered to her by the &s;ervant who generally at|tended upon Henry: I&s;abella demanded a &s;ight of it, and before the girl had time to recollect her&s;elf, it was in her hands, and &s;he read the&s;e words:</P>

<P>At that moment Sir Roger came out of his dre&s;&s;ing room, and ran with agony to de|mand what ailed his darling. Su&s;an, with ad|mirable pre&s;ence of mind, &s;lipt the letter out of &s;ight, and an&s;wered, that her lady had been extremely frighted by the &s;torm, had pa&s;&s;ed a &s;leeple&s;s night, and had fainted through mere weakne&s;s and fatigue;&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"But all will &s;oon be well,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he; <Q REND="inline">"you &s;ee &s;he is recovering,"</Q> (which was true) and then &s;he recounted the accident of the &s;hutter in I&s;abella's hearing, to convince her that no di&s;covery had been made of any other cau&s;e.

<PB N="285" REF="290">
on her ca&s;e, and di&s;cu&s;&s;ed with him the whole proce&s;s he was to follow, both as to medicine and regimen, till they met in London; and concluded by informing Sir Roger, to his utter &s;urpri&s;e, that his niece would repo&s;e her&s;elf at his hou&s;e the very next day, and make that the fir&s;t &s;tage of her journey.</P>
<P>Sir Roger &s;tarted, &s;truck his hands toge|ther with more than u&s;ual energy, and fixing his eyes upon his vi&s;itor, &s;eemed to be &s;urvey|ing him with that &s;ort of curio&s;ity and &s;ur|pri&s;e as a conjurer excites in his &s;pectators, when he has almo&s;t per&s;uaded them that he has the devil in his circle. How did he bring Lord Crowbery to con&s;ent to this, was the que&s;tion from more than one quarter?&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I perceive,"</Q> &s;aid this excellent per&s;on in reply, <Q REND="inline">"I need not di&s;gui&s;e from this company, that I had &s;ome prejudices to overcome; but few di&s;po&s;itions are &s;o naturally ob&s;tinate as to hold out again&s;t truth and rea&s;on: Lady Crow|bery's very &s;erious indi&s;po&s;ition made it my duty to &s;crutinize into cau&s;es, and I &s;aw &s;o much of mental di&s;tre&s;s combin'd with bodily, that I perceiv'd &s;he wou'd be irretrievably lo&s;t, unle&s;s &s;ome in&s;tant relaxation was provided for her; in this part of my inve&s;tigation I had

<P><PB N="287" REF="292">Several enquiries were now made as to Lady Crowbery's mode of travelling, what &s;ervants were to attend upon her, and whether my Lord would accompany her to Man&s;tock or el&s;ewhere. Full information was obtained upon all the&s;e points, and Lord Crowbery did not propo&s;e to go any part of the way with her; he was waiting the event of Mr. Blach|ford's death, which was almo&s;t hourly to be looked for.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"What had he to do with that?"</Q> was the que&s;tion from Mr. Claypole; <Q REND="inline">"Did his Lord&s;hip expect to be benefited by that gen|tleman's decea&s;e?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"If he does,"</Q> replied Mr. L&mdash;, <Q REND="inline">"I have rea&s;on to believe his expectations will be defeated altogether: I met the heir of Mr. Blachford this morning, with|in a mile of his hou&s;e."</Q>&mdash;All ears were in|&s;tantly, as it were, erect for the news; he pro|ceeded,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"As Mr. Blachford does not wi&s;h to keep the di&s;po&s;ition of his property a &s;ecret, I have no &s;cruple to &s;ay, that I was my&s;elf a witne&s;s to his will, and commi&s;&s;ion'd by him to &s;eek for the young gentleman in this hou&s;e, who is to inherit under it; but, as I &s;aid before, I luckily fell in with him, in company with a &s;ea-officer, who, I under&s;tand, is your nephew, Sir, and in a &s;ituation by which I not only

fortunately came to the knowledge of him, but had an opportunity of being in &s;ome fur|ther degree of u&s;e to him."</Q></P>
<P>Here the agitation of more per&s;ons than one became &s;o con&s;picuous, that Mr. L&mdash; found it nece&s;&s;ary to be very quick in a&s;&s;ur|ing his audience, that no manner of mi&s;chief had en&s;ued. A fracas, indeed, had taken place between the heir afore&s;aid and Captain Crowbery, who, in con&s;equence, had turned out by the road &s;ide, with the pi&s;tols which the &s;ea-officer had in his chai&s;e, to &s;ettle their difference; one had been fired without effect by the young gentleman, whom he only knew by the name of Henry, and Captain Crowbery had di&s;charged the other in the air, upon which the quarrel was made up, and the parties, be|fore he left them, perfectly reconciled to each other.</P>

<P>If a tea cup had not, at this in&s;tant, dropt from the fair hand of I&s;abella, by &s;ome chance or other, and drawn the attention of the com|pany to the accident, it is to be pre&s;umed the Reverend Mr. Claypole wou'd not have &s;uf|fered doctrine &s;o adver&s;e to his own to have been advanced by his niece without an an|&s;wer; but as every body &s;eemed intere&s;ted about I&s;abella, he let the matter pa&s;s off, and contented him&s;elf with conveying his di&s;|&s;ent, by the vehicle of a reproving look.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation was now re&s;umed, and many enquiries made as to Blachford's extra|ordinary beque&s;t: was he &s;ufficiently in his &s;en&s;es to dictate a will? and had they taken &s;uch precautions as would prevent a future litigation?&mdash;To this it was an&s;wered by Mr. L&mdash;, that him&s;elf, Zachary Cawdle, and Alexander Kinloch, were witne&s;&s;es not to the will only, but to the capacity and &s;ound &s;en&s;es of the will-maker.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Was it not, how|ever,"</Q> Mr. Claypole demanded, <Q REND="inline">"the mo&s;t &s;ingular and unexpected event that ever came to pa&s;s? and what cou'd have mov'd Blach|ford's heart &s;o on a &s;udden to be&s;tow his whole

<PB N="291" REF="296">
decea&s;e: I under&s;tand there is &s;omething my&s;|terious in his hi&s;tory, but, from the reception he has met in this family, I can't doubt but he well de&s;erves the good fortune that has befallen him."</Q></P>
<P>Here Sir Roger Man&s;tock broke &s;ilence, and in terms &s;trong, though conci&s;e, gave his hearty te&s;timony to the merits and good qua|lities of our hero. When the worthy Baronet had cea&s;ed &s;peaking, Mr. L&mdash; expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf well plea&s;ed that his pre-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in this in&s;tance had not mi&s;led him.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"For I profe&s;s to you,"</Q> &s;aid he, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Sir Roger, <Q REND="inline">"I did never in my life feel a a &s;tronger impre&s;&s;ion from the per&s;on and countenance of any man than in the in&s;tance of this youth, and his conduct in the affair with Captain Crowbery was exactly &s;uch as was be&s;t calculated to confirm it."</Q></P>
<P>Sir Roger, with a &s;mile of approbation, gave &s;ign of his a&s;&s;ent; Fanny Claypole &s;aid, &s;he believed there could be but one opinion in the ca&s;e; and the Reverend Mr. Claypole, &s;traying a little from the &s;ubject in hand, ob|&s;erved, that Henry would now find him&s;elf a very rich and happy man, glancing a look at

<P>But now time pre&s;&s;ed with Mr. L&mdash; for his departure; the carriage was called to the door, and the friend of human mi&s;ery ha&s;tened away to &s;oothe the pains of other &s;ufferers, anxi|ou&s;ly expecting their relief from his hands; it

<HEAD>CHAPTER IX. Bold Mea&s;ures boldly avowed.</HEAD>
<P>THE Reverend Mr. Claypole having duly pondered the&s;e extraordinary occurrences in his mind, found him&s;elf not the le&s;s attracted towards Henry on the &s;core of his good for|tune; for in that gentleman's e&s;timate of his character, pro&s;perity was regarded as no con|temptible recommendation; and he very ju&s;tly con&s;idered, that Mr. Blachford's great property would not make him one whit the wor&s;e hu&s;band to his niece, or his niece the le&s;s affectionate wife to him. Still the cir|cum&s;tance of his ha&s;ty departure with Captain Cary, and the wild idea of volunteering with him, as &s;tated in his letter to Sir Roger Man|&s;tock, &s;eemed to augur &s;o ill for Fanny, that he much doubted if that good under&s;tanding
<PB N="294" REF="299">
between them, of which &s;he had &s;o confidently boa&s;ted, &s;ub&s;i&s;ted any where but in her &s;an|guine imagination; neither could he with all his &s;agacity di&s;cover more than one rea&s;on for a young man's running away from the woman that made love to him, and that rea&s;on was not very compatible with Fanny's report afore&s;aid: as &s;oon therefore as he could find a fair opportunity of drawing her into private conference, he began to open upon the &s;ubject of her attachment; he &s;tated to her what, upon common report, the property of Mr. Blachford was &s;uppo&s;ed to amount to, which, upon the mo&s;t moderate calculation, he gue&s;&s;ed could not be le&s;s than twice as much as her own.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I care little about that,"</Q> cried Fan|ny, <Q REND="inline">"the man is my object."</Q>&mdash;This was very candidly admitted as the fir&s;t but not the only point to be con&s;idered in a connection for life: they could certainly, with proper di&s;cretion, live very comfortably upon their joint means, not lo&s;ing &s;ight in the mean time of future contingencies from Lady Crowbery, who&s;e life, he ob&s;erved with great regret, could not but be very precarious, as change of climate was generally the la&s;t de&s;perate re&s;ource for con&s;ti|tutions, like her's, in deep decay.</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="300">Here Fanny again put him by, declaring, that &s;he looked to no pro&s;pects but the pro|&s;pect of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the dear man of her heart. Mr. Claypole's candour again admitted, that all this was quite natural, and be&s;poke a very &s;incere affection; but he could not exactly &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity why it &s;hould be altogether &s;o di&s;intere&s;ted.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e,"</Q> replied that gene|rous young lady, <Q REND="inline">"if he was the verie&s;t beg|gar upon earth I would marry him; nay, I mu&s;t marry him."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Mu&s;t,"</Q> repeated Claypole in|qui&s;itively; <Q REND="inline">"is there a nece&s;&s;ity in the ca&s;e?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"To be &s;ure there is,"</Q> cried Fanny, nothing aba&s;hed, <Q REND="inline">"after what has pa&s;s'd between us; after all his faithful promi&s;es, all the rapturous care&s;&s;es he lavi&s;h'd upon me, when my fears and &s;woonings in the &s;torm la&s;t night threw me in his power, and expos'd me to the prying eyes of Mi&s;s Man&s;tock, whil&s;t I was lock'd in his embraces.

Let me know the wor&s;t at once, that I may obtain that in|&s;tant reparation, which your character and my honour demand of the &s;educer.

You are yet to learn, that this young gentleman has written to Sir Roger Man&s;tock a farewel letter, in which he tells him he is going out to &s;ea with Captain Cary. Is that a proof of love? Is that con&s;i&s;tent with his promi&s;es? Can a &s;ece&s;&s;ion like this be reconcil'd to honour? And where is your hope of a &s;peedy union with a man who is flying from you and his country?"</Q></P>

No, were he not too honourable he is too wi&s;e for that, too fond, too much a friend to him|&s;elf. As for what he writes to Sir Roger Man|&s;tock, 'tis a mere blind, a concerted matter be|tween us; he &s;aid la&s;t night he wou'd not pa&s;s another day in Man&s;tock hou&s;e; he has fulfill'd his word, and this contrivance extricates him from an unea&s;y &s;ituation, and gives no offence.

<P>A confidence &s;o &s;trongly vouched &s;eemed to have due effect upon the good man, who&s;e tender feelings for his niece had given him &s;uch alarm; his countenance cleared up, and having ruminated a while upon the ca&s;e, he took a more placid tone, and &s;aid&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Well, niece, I have turn'd it over in my thoughts, and do agree with you, that 'twill be better for

you to remove from hence, e&s;pecially as the Lady Crowbery is expected, with whom you have little or no acquaintance, and therefore the be&s;t plea in the world for civilly &s;tepping out of the way from a family meeting of &s;o in|tere&s;ting and melancholy a &s;ort.

I am a great friend to young people, and make all the allowances in rea&s;on for tho&s;e pardonable weakne&s;&s;es that proceed from mutual fondne&s;s for each other.

With this view it &s;trikes me as a proper mea&s;ure to &s;tep over to Crowbery to-morrow, where I can hardly fail of meeting our young friend the heir, and at the &s;ame time that I can impart any me&s;&s;age or letter you may wi&s;h to &s;end, I can avail my&s;elf of the opportunity for paying my re&s;pects to Lady Crowbery, and attending her upon her way to Man&s;tock Hou&s;e, if that is found acceptable."</Q></P>

<P>The&s;e mea&s;ures being &s;o agreed, Mr. Clay|pole's next bu&s;ine&s;s was to &s;eek his friend Sir Roger, whom he very opportunely met, tak|ing a &s;olitary walk in the grove. Claypole's thoughts were ready arranged, and it was with|out difficulty he found words for them, and proper addre&s;s to make his propo&s;al of remov|ing Fanny acceptable to his friend Sir Roger; nay, he was &s;o explicit in &s;tating particulars, and &s;o little &s;paring of his niece's reputation, in the account he gave of her nightly interview with our hero in the gallery, that the worthy Baronet drew exactly tho&s;e conclu&s;ions which Claypole wi&s;hed to lead him to, &s;aw and ac|knowledged the propriety of removing Fanny out of the hou&s;e, and expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf much indebted to his candid friend for the delicacy of the mea&s;ure. At the &s;ame time he was not wanting in all due &s;en&s;ibility on behalf of that friend, and ju&s;t re&s;entment again&s;t Henry for his &s;hare in the tran&s;action. If he did not in|veigh again&s;t him quite &s;o bitterly on this oc|ca&s;ion, as his conduct might &s;eem to merit, it

was becau&s;e he did not &s;ee it in the light of an ab&s;olute &s;eduction, having been a witne&s;s to Fanny's flippant behaviour towards our hero, and being con&s;cious moreover, that he had &s;omething to accu&s;e him&s;elf of for the conver|&s;ation he had held with Henry in the chai&s;e, which po&s;&s;ibly might have in&s;pired him with the fir&s;t idea of a&s;&s;ailing a virtue, that, accord|ing to his own report of it, had no right to be greatly re&s;pected, much le&s;s to be con&s;idered as ab&s;olutely impregnable.</P>
<P>The&s;e reflections, which in &s;ome degree caus'd his anger to abate, did not however pre|vent him from con&s;idering Henry's conduct in its true light, and re&s;enting it as a breach of that decorum, which he had a right to expect from a young man admitted into his family under &s;uch circum&s;tances. He &s;till found him&s;elf called upon, by all the laws of friend&s;hip and ho&s;pitality, to co-operate in every mea&s;ure that Claypole could propo&s;e for obtaining repara|tion for the indignity, and when he under&s;tood that marriage was the point in view, he declar|ed him&s;elf determined to enforce ju&s;tice, if it became nece&s;&s;ary, by re&s;orting to his niece Lady Crowbery, and employing her authority over Henry, in aid of his own, for that purpo&s;e.

This Mr. Claypole begged might be &s;u&s;pended for a while, and at the &s;ame time took occa&s;ion to open his &s;cheme of going over to Crow|bery the next morning, in &s;earch of the young man.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"And &s;o you &s;hall,"</Q> cried the good man, <Q REND="inline">"and my chai&s;e &s;hall be at your &s;ervice, with every thing el&s;e that you can &s;ay on my part, to convince him of the &s;en&s;e I entertain of his con|duct, and to further your appeal for ju&s;tice to your niece. If he has &s;till the hardine&s;s to with&s;tand you, and &s;hall attempt to run out to &s;ea with my nephew Cary, I warrant I have that influence with Jack as will not &s;uffer him to e&s;cape us by that channel at lea&s;t."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I don't pretend to ju&s;tify my niece in all particulars,"</Q> &s;aid Claypole; <Q REND="inline">"but a lady's honour is not to be &s;ported with, and he has certainly made her a firm promi&s;e of marriage; but then, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, it was a promi&s;e made upon the &s;pur of pa&s;&s;ion, and (which is more alarming) made when her fortune was a greater object to him than it has now eventually become."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"In that particular,"</Q> cried Sir Roger, <Q REND="inline">"I do not agree with you. Henry, among&s;t all his failings, is not a mercenary lover; and I mu&s;t believe that Mi&s;s Claypole's fortune is neither more nor le&s;s in his thoughts, for any thing that has
<PB N="303" REF="308">
happen'd to him; and if I am not greatly mi&s;|taken in his character, he is an honourable lad, and will not go back from any promi&s;e he has given. If Mi&s;s Claypole makes a true report, and he has pa&s;s'd his word to her, I think the marriage is &s;ecure; if it is not a ca&s;e of honour, but of choice, I hold it to be doubtful."</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER X. More bad Tidings of our degraded Hero.</HEAD>
<P>IT is time now to attend upon my hero, who, though degraded in character, is in train to be &s;o advanced in fortune's favour, that he has one claim at lea&s;t upon my attention, which does not pa&s;s for nothing with the world at large.</P>
<P>The chai&s;e, in which he was conveyed with his friend Cary from tho&s;e once happy &s;cenes, now forfeited and for&s;aken, made &s;uch rapid progre&s;s, that he &s;oon found him&s;elf within &s;ight of Crowbery Ca&s;tle, proudly towering over its
<PB N="304" REF="309">
dependant village, which &s;pread it&s;elf along the vale. Here, in a narrow lane, our travellers were encountered by a gentleman on hor&s;e-back, who had a fowling-piece in his hand, and was followed by a brace of pointers. The pa&s;s was &s;o &s;trait that civility required the gentle|men in the carriage to &s;top their drivers. Whil&s;t Cary was giving the&s;e orders, he di&s;|covered the per&s;on of Captain Crowbery, and in&s;tantly addre&s;&s;ed him by his name. Henry had recognized him at the &s;ame in&s;tant, and determined to let him know he was in|formed of his de&s;igns, eagerly cried out,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"When you are at lei&s;ure, Captain Crowbery, I &s;hall be glad to have a word with you."</Q></P>
<P>The chai&s;e had &s;topt oppo&s;ite to a gate, which led to a field, and made a rece&s;s in the lane, where Crowbery had taken po&s;t for the convenience of pa&s;&s;ing. He knew the per&s;on of our hero, and this abrupt &s;alutation was an|&s;wered by a demand upon Henry to explain him&s;elf; this explanation was immediately given in terms that required no further illu&s;tration, and with a degree of heat that Cary vainly at|tempted to moderate. Want of &s;pirit was not among&s;t Crowbery's defects; and in the hearing of the Captain, to whom all the particulars
<PB N="305" REF="310">
were &s;o fully known, it wou'd have been in vain for him, had he been &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, to have di&s;avowed the plot he had projected again&s;t the per&s;on of our hero. This he did not attempt, but on the contrary retorted upon Henry with expre&s;&s;ions not le&s;s ho&s;tile than tho&s;e he had made u&s;e of.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Di&s;mount,"</Q> cried Henry; <Q REND="inline">"I have pi&s;tols in the chai&s;e:"</Q> immediately the door was flung open, and he was upon his feet with the weapons in his hand. Crowbery made no delay; the word was given to follow, and they ru&s;hed into the adjoining field together. Cary rai&s;ed his voice to no purpo&s;e, exclaim|ing,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Gentlemen, you are too ha&s;ty; this matter may be explain'd; &s;uffer me to inter|po&s;e."</Q> By this time they had taken their di&s;tance, and each with a pi&s;tol in his hand had levelled at his opponent, Crowbery calling out to fire: Henry gave fire at the in&s;tant, and the ball pa&s;&s;ed through Crowbery's coat, which was unbuttoned.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"You have mi&s;s'd me,"</Q> he cried, and immediately di&s;charged his pi&s;tol in the air."&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Now I am ready,"</Q> added he, <Q REND="inline">"to expre&s;s my regret for what I have done, if that will &s;atisfy you; if not, we will repeat the operation till the offence is cancelled: I wou'd have made atonement at fir&s;t; but the honour
<PB N="306" REF="311">
of a &s;oldier will not permit him to apologize to any one, who with a weapon in his hand calls him out for &s;atisfaction, and precludes an explanation."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Tis enough,"</Q> cried Cary; <Q REND="inline">"your beha|viour, Captain Crowbery, does honour to your|&s;elf and your corps: I am &s;ure my friend is perfectly &s;atisfied."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"With every thing but my&s;elf,"</Q> replied Henry;" <Q REND="inline">"but that I have aim'd at Captain Crowbery's life without ex|po&s;ing my own to the &s;ame danger is a painful reflection, that I &s;hall not ea&s;ily get rid of."</Q>&mdash;At this moment Mr. L&mdash; came up, and his chai&s;e being entangled in the &s;ame defile, he got out upon the report of the pi&s;tol, and ran with all &s;peed to the place of action. As &s;oon as he had &s;een a reconciliation between the parties perfectly effected, he drew Henry a&s;ide, and communicated to him the intelligence he had in charge from Blachford, of which the reader is already informed.</P>
<P>Henry &s;tood rapt in deep attention, ponder|ing upon an event &s;o &s;trange and unlooked for, till Mr. L&mdash;, having clearly detailed the whole account, with all particulars leading to it, cea&s;ed from &s;peaking. Henry now per|ceived it was expected of him to reply, and
<PB N="307" REF="312">
began by returning thanks to Mr. L&mdash; for the communication he had given him, which, he ob&s;erved, was of a &s;ort &s;o extraordinary, that if he had received it from authority le&s;s re&s;pectable, he &s;hould &s;carce have given credit to it, con&s;idering it only as the vapour of a delirium, to which no rationality could be af|fixed, and of cour&s;e he &s;hould have treated the deed as nugatory and illegal&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"But to you, Sir"</Q> added he, <Q REND="inline">'and to the other gentlemen, who atte&s;t his capacity, I mu&s;t give perfect credit. Certain it is that Mr. Blachford, in his dealings with me, has &s;omething to repent of; but it is as certain I needed not to be &s;timulated to forgivene&s;s by any other bribe than the &s;a|tisfaction of giving ea&s;e to the compunctious feelings of a dying man, as you de&s;cribe him to be: I &s;hall in&s;tantly attend upon him ac|cording to his de&s;ire, and to the conclu&s;ions I may draw from that interview I mu&s;t refer my final re&s;olution."</Q></P>
<P>This &s;aid, they parted, Mr. L&mdash; pro|ceeding on his way towards Man&s;tock Hou&s;e, Henry to the cottage of his friend Ezekiel, where Captain Cary &s;et him down, and pur|&s;ued his journey.</P>
<P>It was &s;till early morning; Ezekiel how|ever was up and alone, and had ju&s;t &s;aluted
<PB N="308" REF="313">
the no&s;trils of Aurora with his morning pipe; the &s;moke that curled round his head did not prevent him from recognizing the face of his friend; he drew the tube from his mouth, and greeted him with his u&s;ual welcome: he began immediately upon the bu&s;ine&s;s of Blachford, in which Henry gave him no interruption, though the detail was &s;ufficiently verbo&s;e and circum&s;tantial, in the cour&s;e of which he did not forget to inter|weave many pious calls and admonitions to a worthy u&s;e of the great and unexpected good fortune that had befallen him.</P>
<P>When Henry had heard him to an end, he made a very proper acknowledgment of the obligations he was under to him for his zealous and kind &s;ervices. In this part of his di&s;|cour&s;e, he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with warmth and animation; but when he came to &s;peak of his own immediate intere&s;t in Blachford's intended beque&s;t, the reflections he had brought with him from Man&s;tock Hou&s;e weighed &s;o heavy on his &s;pirits, that his language &s;unk below indifference. This was matter of &s;urpri&s;e to hone&s;t Daw, who knew not that his friend had to lament a lo&s;s, by the forfeiture of I&s;abella's e&s;teem, which no worldly wealth or pro&s;perity
<PB N="309" REF="314">
could compen&s;ate; he was therefore in&s;tant with him not to put on an a&s;&s;umed contempt for the good things of this life, which were only then to be de&s;pi&s;ed when they were un|worthily employed; moderation, he ob&s;erved, was much to be commended, but in&s;en&s;ibility was a degradation of our nature. To a re|mark &s;o little applicable to his ca&s;e, Henry made no reply, but gra&s;ping the hand of the good man, who was &s;itting be&s;ide him, and watching his countenance at this moment, he exclaimed&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"By my &s;oul, Ezekiel, thou ha&s;t the kinde&s;t, be&s;t, and worthie&s;t heart in nature, and when hard fate &s;hall &s;eparate us, as &s;oon it will, by Heavens! the parting from you will make a woman of me, &s;o much do I love and honour you."</Q></P>
<P>Ezekiel &s;tared wildly at him for a moment, then drew the pipe full &s;moking from his mouth, whiffed away what he had drawn from it with an indignant air, and da&s;hed it on the hearth to atoms.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Parting!"</Q> he exclaimed; <Q REND="inline">"by the life of Pharaoh, I will never part from thee!"</Q>&mdash;Then ri&s;ing &s;uddenly from his &s;eat, and &s;tretching him&s;elf up upon his in&s;teps, he a&s;&s;umed a po&s;ture &s;o militarily perpen|dicular, and at the &s;ame time pur&s;ed his
<PB N="310" REF="315">
brow into a frown that marked &s;uch deter|mined re&s;olution, that our hero, gazing with a&s;toni&s;hment upon a figure at once &s;o enthu|&s;ia&s;tic and &s;o grote&s;que, waited in &s;u&s;pen&s;e till the oracle &s;hould utter his definitive re&s;pon&s;e.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Set forward,"</Q> at length cried Ezekiel, <Q REND="inline">"&s;et forward, I &s;ay, young man, when thou wilt, with the ble&s;&s;ing of the Lord, I am ready to accompany thee."</Q></P>
<P>Ezekiel's mind was not made to embrace more than one object at a time, if that was an intere&s;ting one; in friend&s;hip more e&s;peci|ally his ideas were too ardent to be at lei&s;ure for any other &s;ubject collaterally, &s;o that he had ju&s;t now con&s;igned Blachford and his le|gacy to ab&s;olute oblivion; neither did he keep his offer back till enquiry could be made of Henry, whither he was going, and why he was going at all, but having quitted his wicker chair, and di&s;po&s;ed of his tobacco pipe, by &s;hivering it into fragments, he &s;trode to the corner of the kitchen, where he &s;eized hold of his faithful crab&s;tock, and brandi&s;hing it with a gallant air, declared him&s;elf forthwith ready to begin his march.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Hold,"</Q> cried Henry, &s;miling, <Q REND="inline">"have patience, my good friend; our's is no &s;hort trip, and methinks
<PB N="311" REF="316">
you are not equipt for a long one."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">That's true, that's true,"</Q> replied Ezekiel, <Q REND="inline">"I prote&s;t to you my apparel had e&s;cap'd me."</Q>&mdash;And indeed, unle&s;s an old black and white &s;tuff night gown, with a woollen cap on his head, and worn-out &s;hoes cut into &s;lippers on his feet, might be called the proper trim of a tra|veller, hone&s;t Ezekiel was at this moment no otherwi&s;e provided.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But you forget,"</Q> &s;aid Henry, <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Blach|ford and his bu&s;ine&s;s."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Ods my life,"</Q> quoth Daw, <Q REND="inline">"as &s;ure as can be it had &s;lipt my memory, and now it comes into my mind that I &s;hou'd have a&s;ked you whither it is that you are going, and how it comes to pa&s;s that you are po&s;ting away ju&s;t when fortune is dropping into your lap: the&s;e, do you &s;ee, friend Henry, are very natural que&s;tions, and my only wonder is, how it came about that they did not occur to me before."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"'Tis all in good time,"</Q> quoth Henry, <Q REND="inline">"for, if I can prevail, you &s;hall not &s;et a foot without the&s;e doors on my ac|count. With the officer, who accompanied me hither in the chai&s;e, I am going out of England."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Well, well,"</Q> re&s;umed the good man, <Q REND="inline">"if thou art going in a good cau&s;e, were it to circumnavigate the globe, I'll not
<PB N="312" REF="317">
flinch from my word. Do&s;t think, becau&s;e I am a man of peace, I am therefore not a man of &s;pirit? But whither art thou bound? Is it to fight the enemies of our country? Be it &s;o! The danger thou can'&s;t face I &s;hall not fly from."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I know I may depend upon your &s;ecre&s;y,"</Q> &s;aid Henry, <Q REND="inline">"therefore I &s;hall not di&s;gui&s;e from you my intentions: Lady Crow|bery is ordered to Li&s;bon."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"And do&s;t thou think of going with her?"</Q> cried Ezekiel.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Not &s;o,"</Q> replied Henry, <Q REND="inline">"for I &s;hall take my pa&s;&s;age by another conveyance."</Q></P>
<P>Here the preacher &s;hook his head, which, being noticed by our hero&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Bani&s;h all the&s;e horrid notions,"</Q> he cried; <Q REND="inline">"bani&s;h them for ever! Let it not enter into your heart to con|ceive that my motives are not pious, and my duties &s;acred. You would have followed me to pri&s;on, being a &s;tranger to you and a culprit; &s;he is a guiltle&s;s &s;ufferer, my friend and bene|factre&s;s; &s;hall I do le&s;s for her, and be a mon&s;ter of ingratitude?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Thou &s;halt not,"</Q> quoth hone&s;t Daw; <Q REND="inline">"if gratitude be thy mo|tive; I will travel with a grateful man to the world's utmo&s;t limit, nay, beyond it, for I pronounce, that gratitude is a lovely virtue, it is, it is&mdash;but I have now no time to tell thee

what it is; I will &s;peak more fully of it on another occa&s;ion.

<HEAD>CHAPTER XI. A Death-bed Dialogue, in which &s;ome Readers will think there is much Folly, others much Honour, on the Part of our Hero.</HEAD>
<P>WHILST Ezekiel Daw was a&s;cending to his cock-loft, and before Henry had &s;et out upon his vi&s;it to Blachford, Doctor Zachary Cawdle, returning from his patient at the next door, entered the cottage. As &s;oon as he e&s;pied our hero&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Welcome, welcome,"</Q> he exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"thou child of good fortune; &s;ure the &s;kies rain gold for you; here's a chance, and a change! Marry, the times are &s;trangely altered, Henry, &s;ince you and I fir&s;t met. Why this ju&s;tice of our's is indeed a ju&s;tice at la&s;t, and hone&s;t Ezekiel the preacher has once in his life preach'd to &s;ome purpo&s;e; I have only made a hole in the head of my patient, he has open'd his heart. And &s;o you are now the 'Squire of Crowbery, heir to his whole fortune, a few legacies excepted, one of which I am &s;ure you will not regret, a &s;mall beque&s;t to Su&s;an May, to balance old ac|compts: but what gratifies me above all is, that he has entirely cut this good-for-nothing
<PB N="315" REF="320">
Peer out of his will, who &s;tood heir to his whole property before this blow upon his &s;cull brought my patient to a better recol|lection. Death and Ezekiel together have wrought a wonderful reformation."</Q></P>
<P>When Zachary had rambled on in this &s;train for &s;ome time, Henry, who had paid little or no attention to what he had been &s;aying, de|manded if it was now a proper time for him to pay his vi&s;it to Mr. Blachford? Zachary replied, that he had ju&s;t then been dre&s;&s;ing his wound, and wou'd recommend him to wait a few minutes before he pre&s;ented him&s;elf for admi&s;&s;ion.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Sit down then,"</Q> cried Henry, <Q REND="inline">"if you plea&s;e, and &s;atisfy my anxious curio&s;ity on a &s;ubject infinitely more intere&s;ting to me, than all my expectations from Mr. Blachford, had he the wealth of the Indies to be&s;tow."</Q> He then began a cour&s;e of enquiries relative to his mother, which, with Zachary's circum|&s;tantial an&s;wers, and certain occa&s;ional digre&s;|&s;ions, into which his profe&s;&s;ional vanity be|trayed him, held on the conver&s;ation till it was time for him to repair to Blachford. He had, however, in the cour&s;e of this conver&s;a|tion, commi&s;&s;ioned Zachary to report to his mother every thing that he wi&s;hed her to be
<PB N="316" REF="321">
informed of, re&s;pecting the time he &s;hould pa&s;s in attendance upon Blachford, and the re&s;olu|tion he had taken of repairing to Li&s;bon, in the hope of paying his duty to her there: he was very particular in guarding again&s;t mi&s;|takes, and repeated his in&s;tructions &s;o fre|quently, and with &s;uch preci&s;ion, that Zacha|ry, who did not ju&s;t then call to mind all the rea&s;ons for his caution, began to feel offended at his manner, and a&s;ked him, if he could not tru&s;t his memory for conveying a &s;imple me&s;|&s;age?&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I &s;hou'd have thought &s;o,"</Q> replied Henry, <Q REND="inline">"if you had not, mo&s;t unfortunately for me, let it fail you in the matter of the little packet, which you was to deliver to me from may mother."</Q>&mdash;He then proceeded to explain to him the importance of that paper, the op|portunity he had lo&s;t by not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing it in time, and the fatal con&s;equences that had nearly en&s;ued upon his altercation with the per&s;on it alluded to. Zachary heard all this with a&s;toni&s;hment, and after be&s;towing upon him&s;elf a very plentiful proportion of block|heads and boobies, promi&s;ed that he would &s;pare no pains to atone for his mi&s;take, by en|quiring out Mr. Delapoer, when he &s;hould arrive in London with Lady Crowbery; and
<PB N="317" REF="322">
he de&s;paired not but intelligence could there be obtained of him, if he was actually in Eng|land, as Lady Crowbery &s;uppo&s;ed, of which, however, he declared, for his part, he took leave to doubt. And now the time being come when the Doctor judged his patient might be acce&s;|&s;ible, he a&s;ked Henry if he had &s;et his thoughts in order for an interview; and being an&s;wered that he was ready to accompany him, he ro&s;e from his &s;eat, when Henry, recollecting him|&s;elf on a &s;udden, &s;topt, and taking him by the button, &s;aid&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"One word more if you plea&s;e before we part: I think you &s;aid there was a legacy bequeathed to Su&s;an May, and that it was to balance old accompts: I prythee, my good friend, tell me, if it is no inviolable &s;e|cret, what tho&s;e old accompts are which Blach|ford has to balance."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Humph!"</Q> quoth the accoucheur, <Q REND="inline">"it was an account of about nine months &s;tanding, and &s;uch a one as &s;ometimes falls into my hands to audit; if you can gue&s;s at it you may, but we reveal no &s;ecrets of this &s;ort, 'tis again&s;t the freema&s;onry of our or|der."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Well then,"</Q> &s;aid Henry, <Q REND="inline">"I know it, but you did not tell me. Blachford, we will &s;uppo&s;e, &s;educ'd Su&s;an May, and had a child by her; is it not &s;o?</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I mu&s;t confe&s;s,"</Q> re|plied
<PB N="318" REF="323">
the Doctor, <Q REND="inline">"there is as fine a boy now alive, of &s;omebody's producing, as ever I u&s;her'd into the world, your&s;elf not excepted, and, to the be&s;t of my belief, his Wor&s;hip has the honour of being the father of it; 'tis but right, therefore, you &s;ee, that &s;ome provi&s;ion &s;hould be made for its maintenance, and, if I am not mi&s;taken, it is to the exact amount of forty pounds a year, charg'd upon the e&s;tate, which I dare &s;ay you will not think unrea&s;on|able."</Q></P>
<P>Here Zachary made a pau&s;e; but Henry re|maining &s;ilent, he proceeded&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"You will hear this from Blachford him&s;elf, in which ca&s;e I &s;hall be acquitted of the &s;ecret; but, as we have kept it clo&s;e hitherto, I am per&s;uaded you will not let it get out, to the prejudice of the poor girl in her place, for I think &s;he will hardly be &s;o fooli&s;h as to throw that up vo|luntarily on account of this legacy."</Q>&mdash;Henry a&s;ked if this was all Blachford had done for the mother and child? Zachary a&s;&s;ured him that, to the be&s;t of his remembrance, there was no other incumbrance on their account; it was a ca&s;e of con&s;cience, he ob&s;erved, and though he believed they had been upon no terms of in|timacy for &s;ome time part, yet, for his own
<PB N="319" REF="324">
part he &s;hould have given very little credit to Blachford's reformation, if he had gone out of the world, and taken no notice of a poor girl, whom he had rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect was trepanned into the &s;crape by very unfair practices; and though perhaps &s;he was &s;omewhat of the wilde&s;t afterwards, as Henry him&s;elf probably could witne&s;s, yet whom had &s;he to thank for it but her &s;educer?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Tis enough,"</Q> cried Henry; <Q REND="inline">"I am ready to attend you to Mr. Blachford's."</Q></P>
<P>After waiting a few minutes in a lower room, whil&s;t the Doctor went up &s;tairs to announce his arrival, our hero was admitted to the &s;ick man's chamber: he was lying on his couch, &s;upported by pillows, and upon Henry's en|tering, Zachary and the nur&s;e retired. One &s;mall ray of light was let into the room, which &s;erved to guide the &s;teps of our hero through the gloom, who had been de&s;ired to tread with great caution, and to &s;peak low, as the lea&s;t jar was intolerable to the aching brain of the wounded man. A chair was placed clo&s;e to the couch, at the right hand of Blachford, who made a &s;ign to his vi&s;itor to &s;eat him&s;elf in it. This he accordingly did, treading lightly and with care as he moved towards it.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="325">A &s;ilence for &s;ome time was ob&s;erved by both parties, Blachford holding his handkerchief to his eyes the whil&s;t. At la&s;t, &s;peaking in a feeble tone, he &s;aid&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I am afraid and a&s;ham'd to look upon you; I fear it is not po&s;&s;ible you can forgive me, and, if you cou'd, how can I hope&mdash;"</Q> Here &s;omething &s;eemed to choak his &s;peech, and he broke off. Henry waited awhile in compa&s;&s;ionate attention, but finding him relap&s;ing into his former debility, with his handkerchief again held to his eyes, he thought it time to &s;peak, and addre&s;&s;ed him as fol|lows;&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Mr. Blachford, I do be&s;eech you to believe, that what I am about to &s;ay to you is not dictated by any intere&s;ted motives, but &s;prings freely and voluntarily from my heart, influenced only by an unfeigned commi&s;era|tion for the &s;tate in which I find you, and a firm reliance on the &s;incerity of your contri|tion. For whatever you have done or medi|tated again&s;t me, I do mo&s;t entirely and from my &s;oul forgive you."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You are infinitely kind and compa&s;&s;ion|ate,"</Q> &s;aid Blachford, faintly; <Q REND="inline">"but I have been the cruelle&s;t of mon&s;ters towards you, not only in the dark bu&s;ine&s;s that has brought me to this condition, but in the matter of the trial,
<PB N="321" REF="326">
where I wou'd fain have &s;uppre&s;s'd the evi|dence that &s;o clearly acquitted you: but this is not all; it was I who &s;et Lord Crowbery upon you; I was the tale-bearer from that wretched woman Mrs. Cawdle, that made him furious again&s;t you and his unhappy lady, who, I dare &s;ay, was fal&s;ely &s;lander'd and unju&s;tly per&s;ecuted through my means; I have all her &s;ufferings on my con&s;cience; I am weigh'd down by offences. Alas! what will become of me? and what atonement can I now make to you in the fir&s;t place? what to that in|jur'd Lady, who&s;e health, fame, happine&s;s, have been &s;acrific'd to my malice? for it was the very demons of malice, envy and jealou&s;y, that po&s;&s;e&s;s'd me again&s;t you, and through you again&s;t her. All that I can do is all too little; yet what I can I have done. I know I can ex|pect no mercy from Heaven, if I do not &s;trive to repair the wrongs I have done upon earth. Ju&s;tice demands that I &s;hould do my be&s;t to make that life happy, which I have at|tempted to de&s;troy: Heaven grant that my en|deavours may &s;ucceed! Poverty at lea&s;t you need no longer dread; by this deed you are heir to all I am po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of, and, be a&s;&s;ur'd, mo&s;t excellent young man, that if con&s;cience
<PB N="322" REF="327">
did not force me to the act, choice and opinion in your favour wou'd now lead me to it freely and voluntarily, for I am confident you de|&s;erve it, and long, long may you enjoy it!"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"If I am to receive this,"</Q> &s;aid Henry, (taking the will that Blachford tendered to him) <Q REND="inline">"as an act of ju&s;tice and atonement, which your con&s;cience impels you to di&s;charge, I cer|tainly &s;hall not oppo&s;e my&s;elf to your will and plea&s;ure; but before I acquie&s;ce in a deed that accumulates all your atonement upon me alone, I &s;hou'd know, and be convinc'd, there are no other injur'd per&s;ons who have better claims upon it; nay, give me leave to &s;ay, who have any claims. You well ob&s;erv'd ju&s;t now, that you cou'd expect no mercy from Heaven, if you did not &s;trive to repair the wrongs you have done upon earth; it was a becoming &s;en|timent, and I believe I repeat it nearly, if not correctly, in your own words; &s;uffer me, therefore, I conjure you, by your hope in Heaven, to put it clo&s;ely to your con&s;cience, whether you have repair'd all wrongs com|mitted again&s;t others as fully and &s;ufficiently as you have tho&s;e committed again&s;t me?"</Q></P>
<P>The &s;ick man pau&s;ed, as one employed in recollection; at la&s;t he &s;aid, he thought he
<PB N="323" REF="328">
could reply with a &s;afe con&s;cience, that he had made proportionable re&s;titution to all claimants on the &s;core of injuries&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"One of that de&s;crip|tion,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"you will find remember'd in my will; an acquaintance of your own, Su&s;an May by name; I have burthen'd you with a provi&s;ion of forty pounds a year for her life."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And why have you &s;o done?"</Q> &s;aid Henry. <Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e&mdash;becau&s;e,"</Q> replied Blachford, <Q REND="inline">"I have extorted favours from her &s;he did not voluntarily grant, and thereby encumber'd her with difficulties and expences which this an|nuity will amply &s;atisfy. Ah! my dear Sir!"</Q> added he, <Q REND="inline">"this was the &s;evere&s;t tug of all I had to &s;truggle with; for that girl has been the cruel cau&s;e of all my mi&s;ery. I was infatuated with her charms, I doated upon her to di&s;trac|tion; but as &s;oon as &s;he &s;et her eyes on you, &s;he turn'd them from me with loathing and ab|horrence. This was horror to my heart: this it was that made me &s;urious to revenge my&s;elf on you: 'twas jealou&s;y, outrageous jealou&s;y, that in&s;pir'd me to attempt your life: judge, therefore, what I had to combat, before I cou'd per&s;uade my&s;elf to make atonement to one, whom in rea&s;on I regarded as rather bound to atone to me, for all the pains and &s;orrows that
<PB N="324" REF="329">
have embitter'd my &s;ad cup, and brought me to this lamentable &s;tate of body and of mind."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You have an infant &s;on by her,"</Q> &s;aid Henry.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"You know it then, it &s;eems,"</Q> re|plied the &s;ick man; <Q REND="inline">"I have a &s;on by her; at lea&s;t I think he is my &s;on; and in that per&s;ua|&s;ion nature had it's &s;hare of influence for &s;oft|ening my re&s;entment, and inducing me to make provi&s;ion for a helple&s;s innocent."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"What mu&s;t that nature be,"</Q> cried Henry, <Q REND="inline">"which does not feel this influence? But you have us'd the word re&s;entment; I pray you Sir, inform me rightly of your cau&s;e of re&s;ent|ment again&s;t this young woman; Did &s;he &s;e|duce you, or you her?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You know her well, I dare &s;ay, Sir,"</Q> &s;aid Blachford; <Q REND="inline">"you mu&s;t have had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her frequently."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Never, I take Heaven to witne&s;s; never, by all that's &s;acred,"</Q> exclaimed Henry, elevat|ing his voice rather above the pitch proper for his &s;ituation.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You a&s;toni&s;h me,"</Q> &s;aid the other; <Q REND="inline">may I indeed believe you?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"As confidently as you believe in Heaven. She is innocent for me; I &s;hou'd be happy for your con&s;cience &s;ake cou'd you &s;ay as much
<PB N="325" REF="330">
with the &s;ame truth; for yet you have not an|&s;wer'd to the que&s;tion of &s;eduction, on which, as I conceive, the whole of your re&s;pon&s;ibility mu&s;t turn, and by that you ought to mea&s;ure and proportion your atonement."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Then I will an&s;wer you,"</Q> returned Blach|ford, &s;ighing, <Q REND="inline">"and di&s;charge my troubled con&s;cience by confe&s;&s;ion of the whole proceed|ding. Seduction ba&s;e as hell was practis'd by my agent to &s;ubmit her to my de&s;ires; my hou&s;ekeeper, a woman corrupted to my pur|po&s;es, invited this girl, then &s;ixteen years of age, and lovely as an angel, to her room in my hou&s;e; there &s;he care&s;s'd her, treated her with dainties, &s;uch as &s;he, poor thing, had never ta&s;ted, gave her rich cordials, per&s;uading her of their harmle&s;s quality, and &s;o, in fine, intoxi|cated her by &s;urpri&s;e: that moment was her ruin: devil as I was, in that &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibi|lity I accompli&s;h'd my vile purpo&s;e. The in|toxication pa&s;s'd off, and the recovery of her &s;en&s;es di&s;clos'd the injury &s;he had &s;uffer'd; her agonies were &s;trong, and her reproaches vehement; but &s;oothings, pre&s;ents, promi&s;es, were lavi&s;hly be&s;tow'd, and in conclu&s;ion took effect: &s;he was poor, and vain of her fair per|&s;on; I was not wanting to profit of that va|nity,
<PB N="326" REF="331">
and I gave her means to deck her&s;elf out in a &s;tyle that put down all her rivals in the village. The good dame, her mother, it is true, was alarm'd; but I took means to lull her &s;u&s;picions, and &s;he liv'd rent-free in her cot|tage: I don't &s;ay &s;he accommodated me in my intrigue, but &s;he was credulous in the extreme, and my profe&s;&s;ions, jointly with my favours, blinded her effectually. Su&s;an recover'd her &s;pirits, and I, by a collu&s;ion with that &s;orry jade, whom hone&s;t Cawdle is condemn'd to call wife, put Su&s;an into her &s;ervice, removing her from under the eye of her mother and that worthy &s;oul Ezekiel Daw, who liv'd with her. Here I had free acce&s;s; but dearly paid by oc|ca&s;ional civilities to that di&s;gu&s;tful &s;ot her mi&s;|tre&s;s. At nine months end from my fir&s;t know|ledge of her &s;he bore this boy; Zachary brought him into the world, and the affair was &s;ecretly &s;o manag'd as to create no &s;u&s;picion, even in her mother. It is a lovely boy, and I put him out to nur&s;e, providing for his mainte|nance, and frequently vi&s;iting him. Here then you have my full confe&s;&s;ion: let Su&s;an therefore enjoy her annuity, which I can well believe you think &s;he fully de&s;erves; and &s;uffer me to hope you will protect and be a father to my helple&s;s child."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="332"><Q REND="inline">"Hear me!"</Q> cried Henry, <Q REND="inline">"and let me implore you to have regard for your departing &s;oul: I am my&s;elf, like your poor innocent, a &s;on of nature, born out of marriage, thrown upon the world without inheritance, and unac|knowledg'd by the laws of man; yet I have found a friend that leaves me nothing to re|gret, when I decline your bounty, which here I &s;olemnly declare, calling my God to witne&s;s, I peremptorily renounce in favour of your &s;on. Bequeath not your own child to a &s;tranger; make not me your intermediate in&s;trument of ju&s;tice, but plead your own atonement at the throne of mercy, and delay not for a moment to mitigate the wrath of that ju&s;t judge, who will not &s;pare the parent that abandons his own offspring."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Oh horrible!"</Q> cried Blachford, <Q REND="inline">"you tear my heart a&s;under."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not &s;o,"</Q> Henry an&s;wered, lowering his voice; <Q REND="inline">"I'll heal it, &s;often it, comfort it. You &s;hall live happily, or die in peace; and never will I quit this place till you con&s;ent to what I a&s;k. 'Tis for your &s;ake I intercede; it is to awaken nature in your heart, and reconcile you to your God, that I thus earne&s;tly conjure you to &s;trike out my name from this mi&s;taken paper, and adopt your &s;on."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="333"><Q REND="inline">"My&s;terious, wonderful young man!"</Q> cried Blachford; <Q REND="inline">"I do not know your name; the blanks are left for you to fill."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Then fill them with the name that na|turally &s;hou'd fill them. Send for your infant and his mother; I'll be your me&s;&s;enger. Enjoy the gratifying &s;ight of tho&s;e whom you make happy, and let me be not your heir, but the executor of your will, and the guardian of your &s;on; then I will call you ju&s;t; then and only then I will honour your memory, and record you as my friend and benefactor."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Do with me as you will,"</Q> cried Blachford; <Q REND="inline">"your genero&s;ity overcomes me; I &s;icken and am faint; language fails me: I commit my|&s;elf to your di&s;po&s;al."</Q></P>
<P>Our hero &s;aid no more; his &s;uit was granted; joy &s;welled his benevolent heart; he ro&s;e from his &s;eat, ca&s;t a look of pity on the dying man and departed.</P>
