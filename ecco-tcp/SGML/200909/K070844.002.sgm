<HEAD><HI>LETTER I.</HI> On entering Spain from France. The Coun|try. The Mountains. National and Provincial Objects. French Government.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Bilbao.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE entered Spain, this time, with &s;ome prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in its favour, though already tolerably acquainted with it: having, on former occa&s;ions, examined the &s;outhern parts with &s;ome plea&s;ure, I am now traver&s;ing the northern provinces of
<PB N="2" REF="8">
the <HI>penin&s;ula,</HI> as the Spaniards are fond of calling it.</P>
<P>A &s;mall party of young people, finding or fancying them&s;elves tired of French faces and French non&s;en&s;e, readily agreed to take the opportunity of my little bu&s;ine&s;s in this country, and to go in &s;earch of &s;omething &s;uperior, and perhaps not without hopes of &s;ome curious adventures in the&s;e regions of romance: for, I think, the very mention of Spain awakens in the mind, e&s;pecially of young people, ideas of &s;omething ro|mantic and uncommon.</P>
<P>Our &s;chemes, principles, or prejudices, once adopted, you know the fancy has a wonderful knack at confirming us in them by many artful ways, and of &s;educing us by her manner of colouring and &s;hewing us the objects of inclination, and by con|cealing or di&s;torting the re&s;t. Overlook|ing, therefore, the many excellent and amiable qualities of the French in our fre|quent con&s;ultations, and imagining our|&s;elves di&s;gu&s;ted with their follies and af|fectation,
<PB N="3" REF="9">
we left their country, almo&s;t con|firmed in the expectation of finding all the oppo&s;ite qualities in Spain;&mdash;more of pure nature, &s;incerity, and &s;ound &s;en&s;e,&mdash;their mirth and their mu&s;ic, and every thing more to our ta&s;te. Now, though our hopes, as u&s;ual, have already proved partly delu|&s;ive, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that &s;pecific differences do exi&s;t between the charac|ters of the&s;e two nations, and that &s;everal circum&s;tances in the approaches to Spain, on this &s;ide, are calculated to produce a favourable di&s;po&s;ition in the traveller.</P>
<P>Many objects in this country concur to fill the mind with noble and plea&s;ing &s;enti|ments. Our fir&s;t &s;ight of the Pyrenean mountains, from a va&s;t di&s;tance, viewing their &s;nowy tops above the clouds from the <HI>landes,</HI> an arid and de&s;ert plain; then the gradual ri&s;e of that tire&s;ome plain, as we advance, into beautiful green hills, lakes, woods, and at length to naked or &s;nowy rocks that &s;eem to pierce the heavens; all contribute to in&s;pire new and &s;ublime ideas; and the mind, thus warmed and
<PB N="4" REF="10">
elevated, is di&s;po&s;ed to &s;pread the beauties that plea&s;e us, over all the objects around.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the&s;e countries formed by the &s;kirts of the Pyrenees, are beautiful, and very different from the re&s;t of France, and, in my opinion, much &s;uperior to mo&s;t of it. The human &s;pecies, as you advance, &s;eems likewi&s;e to change and improve into a more vigorous and hardy race; they are fond of their liberties, for which they have often encountered that de&s;poti&s;m by which they are &s;urrounded. It has been ob&s;erved, that the Bayonne privateers have generally fought well: la&s;t war, they gained great credit.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e mountains lies Bearn, the country of Henry IV. Here he was born, and pa&s;&s;ed his infancy. Full of the idea of this excellent king, I wi&s;hed to trace him from his cradle, and as it were, &s;ee where he went, and what he did; but could not prevail with the re&s;t of the party. The imagination, led away with that heroic character, with the&s;e romantic and &s;ublime
<PB N="5" REF="11">
&s;cenes of nature, and with all my old preju|dices in favour of mountaineers, I began to doubt and di&s;pute&mdash;if a level country be fit to produce great men.</P>
<P>Here we meet with good country-hou&s;es, in noble &s;ituations; al&s;o plenty, ho&s;pitality, and old hearty country manners. But mo&s;t of the e&s;tates, even the &s;malle&s;t, are entailed, and hence little land ever comes to market. Such a &s;top to the circulation of property is a great hindrance to the im|provement of a country.</P>
<P>The ports of Bayonne and St. Jean de Luz, &s;how now a con&s;iderable &s;pirit of commerce and improvement; but the ef|fects of that &s;pirit do not extend far into the country. The&s;e ports have been im|proved, exten&s;ive piers con&s;tructed and kept up, at a great expence; but the op|pre&s;&s;ions of a government remote and jea|lous, by gradually impairing their privi|leges, will probably, in time, reduce the&s;e people to a common level with the re&s;t of
<PB N="6" REF="12">
their &s;ubjects, to poverty and dependence; &mdash;a prey to intendants, fermiers, gabelles, &amp;c. The in&s;olence of people in office will then more than counterbalance the opera|tions of indu&s;try. Their ports will fall to ruin, and fill up, by any remi&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e con&s;tant and expen&s;ive efforts that are ne|ce&s;&s;ary again&s;t their other powerful ene|mies, the &s;ea and &s;and, that are perpetually rolling in upon them from the Bay of Bi&s;cay.</P>
<P>This leads to reflections on &s;ubjects which I would rather wi&s;h to recommend to your future con&s;ideration, than attempt to decide upon now; <HI>viz.</HI> Of the various objects of public concern, to di&s;tingui&s;h that which ought to be left to provincial or local ma|nagement, from what &s;hould be under that of the general or national government. The national government generally errs, I think, on the wrong &s;ide, and, a&s;&s;uming the management of every thing, leaves too little for the people them&s;elves to do: overlook|ing the &s;mall, but more effectual, encou|ragement
<PB N="7" REF="13">
and a&s;&s;i&s;tance which would often incite the people to help them&s;elves, and produce more public good.</P>
<P>If the French government were to try &s;ome experiments of this kind, in different provinces, as has often been propo&s;ed, and give up to them the management of &s;everal branches of taxation, of revenue, and public works, they might be enabled to decide upon &s;ome general &s;y&s;tem for the whole nation. But there is not much probability of that government going &s;o far. Were they even to begin and &s;et heartily about it, they would probably tire in the cour&s;e of it, and fail in attempting to &s;urmount &s;ome of the various &s;ucce&s;&s;ions of difficulties that would ari&s;e. From &s;ome few in&s;tances of ignorance or di&s;hone&s;ty, they would ha&s;tily pronounce the pro|vinces unfit to be tru&s;ted with their own affairs.</P>
<P>We now go on with our journey, and enter Spain through great variety and &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ions of grand mountains, where I
<PB N="8" REF="14">
wi&s;hed to have &s;taid much longer to in|dulge in contemplating tho&s;e maje&s;tic &s;cenes of nature: but I will not, therefore, de|tain you there, with poetic, glowing, or raving de&s;criptions, which are generally better calculated to amu&s;e the writer than the reader, and prove mo&s;tly inadequate to the purpo&s;es of tran&s;mitting the ideas or the &s;entiments intended.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER II.</HI> Guipu&s;coa. Lime. Police. People. Women. Frontier. Indu&s;try. Liberty. Policy. Pa&s;age. St. Seba&s;tian's.</HEAD>
<P>ON entering Spain by Guipu&s;coa, plea&s;|ed and elevated by that noble and maje&s;tic kind of country,&mdash;from the heavy &s;ands, and bad roads of Guienne, to the new and excellent ones of the&s;e provinces, &mdash;from the heathy or naked <HI>landes,</HI> to the&s;e magnificent mountains, which are mo&s;tly cultivated, or covered with woods, we continued &s;till, for a time, prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in favour of the country in general, and rather blind to the &s;urrounding poverty and dirt, which, however, &s;oon began to appear in various &s;hapes.</P>
<P>In the&s;e northern, and in other parts of Spain, the want of lime-&s;tone is a more capital defect than you may at fir&s;t imagine.
<PB N="10" REF="16">
The little lime they can afford to procure, mu&s;t be brought by &s;ea. The want of neatne&s;s, and of fini&s;hing, in their ordi|nary buildings,&mdash;the dead and melancholy appearance of the country, though tole|rably filled with villages, are among the con&s;equences of this want.</P>
<P>Their towns and villages are, even here, likewi&s;e deficient in other little objects of police and cleanline&s;s, in contrivance and manner of building, on which, with us, depend many of the comforts of life; and &s;till more in the internal parts of Spain. So that, as we advance into the country, the mortifying and loath&s;ome pro&s;pects of human mi&s;ery and indolence increa&s;e upon us, and are too often &s;ufficient to damp the &s;pirits of the mo&s;t cheerful and invin|cible traveller: and more e&s;pecially, if he is &s;atisfied with a fir&s;t view, and does not &s;top long enough anywhere to learn the language, and to di&s;cover &s;ome of tho&s;e valuable and agreeable qualities to be found in the character and <HI>trato,</HI> i. e. the di&s;po&s;i|tion and behaviour of many excellent in|dividuals
<PB N="11" REF="17">
of both &s;exes; and in the man|ners and humours of the people, all of which &s;o generally and warmly attach tho&s;e who &s;tay any time among them.</P>
<P>After &s;ome conver&s;ation and debate, I think our party all agree, that the Spani&s;h character is readily di&s;tingui&s;hable from the French, and in &s;ome things rather advan|tageou&s;ly, amid&s;t all their &s;carcity, their poverty, and negligence of appearance. In the female &s;ex, the difference is &s;triking. In many, the figure and manner, the eyes and ca&s;t of features, the &s;hape and air, the kind of animation and &s;en&s;ibility, more temperate and graceful, yet far more &s;igni|ficant and powerful. In &s;hort, the &s;ex &s;eem here a different, and mo&s;t of us think, a &s;uperior race of beings, even to tho&s;e we left on the other &s;ide of the Pyrenees, whom neverthele&s;s, you know, I highly e&s;teem.</P>
<P>Spain has here a good defen&s;ible fron|tier. Fonterabia, now neglected, has formerly re&s;i&s;ted the whole power of
<PB N="12" REF="18">
France. But this is the be&s;t part of their frontier. They could not now keep the French out of their country in ca&s;e of war. The other pa&s;&s;es of the Pyrenees are in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of France, as at Belgarde, &amp;c. This is a material circum&s;tance in their al|liance, and &s;ecures its duration.</P>
<P>The French, by the way, they &s;ay, begin to work a good copper-mine in the&s;e moun|tains, towards Navarre, within the Spani&s;h frontier; and if they can once erect mills, and manufacture that metal as we do, they may, in time, copper their &s;hips as readily, with &s;everal other advantages.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the&s;e three or four northern provinces of Spain are, I think, a more &s;tout, hardy, and healthy race, than the re&s;t. They eat more animal food than mo&s;t others, except the Engli&s;h, and, like them, are of a noble, frank, and generous temper. They are di&s;tingui&s;hable enough from tho&s;e of the other provinces, in cha|racter, per&s;on, and countenance, by one who lives in Spain, though not &s;o readily
<PB N="13" REF="19">
by foreigners, who con&s;ider all as Spaniards who inhabit the kingdom: but a Bi&s;cayan, or a Catalan, is offended by that appella|tion.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal vi&s;ibly di&s;tinct races of people in Spain. The&s;e are among the mo&s;t laborious. They cultivate their mountains (and their country con&s;i&s;ts of little el&s;e) to the very tops, chiefly with in&s;truments worked by hand, as large hoes, forks, &amp;c. and in which both &s;exes labour equally and together. This is the only country in Spain where planting is attended to. There are laws that oblige them to plant when they cut their trees: timber being nece&s;&s;ary to their iron-works and &s;hip building, and it adds great beauty to the country. The&s;e branches of indu&s;try might be carried much farther, if the Spani&s;h government could be wi&s;e enough to let them alone, and only buy their iron, their guns, and &s;hips, and contrive for them &s;ome gradually increa&s;ing demand or market, &s;o as to increa&s;e and employ &s;o u&s;eful a people. But govern|ment is &s;upplied from abroad with &s;everal
<PB N="14" REF="20">
things which, it is &s;aid, might be made or produced here.</P>
<P>The&s;e three <HI>Ba&s;congada</HI> provinces, Gui|pu&s;coa, Alava, and Bi&s;caya, together with Navarre, are now the only remaining a&s;y|lums in the penin&s;ula for liberty: and its effects &s;till evidently appear in their charac|ter, indu&s;try, and population, to the obvi|ous advantage of both the governing and governed. But &s;ome of the over-wi&s;e Spani&s;h lawyers are already beginning to embroil this bu&s;ine&s;s, and to per&s;uade go|vernment that the&s;e people are too free,&mdash; that they are bad and di&s;loyal &s;ubjects: and this over-wi&s;e government &s;eems inclined to believe &s;uch doctrine, and to &s;hew a mean and unju&s;t jealou&s;y of their pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>Spain has certainly hitherto found her account in leaving the&s;e provinces thus loo&s;ely attached to her, on their own terms, appointing only one or two of their chief magi&s;trates, and a commi&s;&s;ary to take care of the revenue; permitting them to make their own laws, rai&s;e their taxes, and to
<PB N="15" REF="21">
govern their own affairs nearly as they plea&s;e. Every advantage and &s;ucce&s;s that could well be expected, have attended the&s;e mea&s;ures, and would go on to attend them probably &s;till more in future, if there could be wi&s;dom and liberality enough in the Spani&s;h government only to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in promoting their own patriotic mea&s;ures, and help the leading men among them to improve the country. And &s;uch are the be&s;t, and perhaps the only maxims by which any nation or community &s;hould ever permit it&s;elf to govern another. We &s;hould, in &s;uch ca&s;es, do all the good we can, without &s;topping to calculate the bene|fits that may re&s;ult to our&s;elves. Various advantages to the &s;uperior power, will ge|nerally be the fruits of &s;uch mea&s;ures; and the produce more certain and direct, than by all the political and u&s;urious bargains, laws, or treaties, that could previou&s;ly be made to &s;ecure their obedience or their cu&s;tom. But &s;uch mea&s;ures I doubt whether their government is capable of pur&s;uing for a &s;ufficient length of time: and it is not &s;o much from any plan or de&s;ign, as from in|dolence,
<PB N="16" REF="22">
inability, accident, and other cir|cum&s;tances of the Spani&s;h government, that the&s;e mountaineers have hitherto e&s;cap|ed the &s;ame yoke as their neighbouring provinces.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation and &s;ucce&s;s of the&s;e are cer|tainly worth the con&s;ideration of a travel|ler, and may furni&s;h u&s;eful political le&s;&s;ons for other nations and their dependents; and likewi&s;e for Spain her&s;elf: for with her di&s;tant colonies &s;he has followed contrary maxims, and has generally &s;ucceeded badly. If you had followed &s;uch maxims with your colonies, if you had &s;lackened in&s;tead of tightened the reins of government, and permitted the &s;overeignty gradually to re|lax and dimini&s;h, both you and they might probably have gone on to pro&s;per for ever together: that connection, if left alone to its natural progre&s;&s;ion, would have gradually changed into &s;ome intercour&s;e more bene|ficial to both, but would never, probably, have arrived at a total &s;eparation, and might always have promoted your mutual political advantages: and let us &s;till hope, in ca&s;e of
<PB N="17" REF="23">
a political &s;eparation, that you may both &s;oon recover your tempers, &s;o as to re&s;tore an intimate commercial connexion.</P>
<P>The&s;e northern provinces having proved more intere&s;ting than was expected, we have been agreeably di&s;appointed, in &s;pite of the defects already mentioned, and I wi&s;hed to dwell in the country, and on the &s;ubject, more than time will permit to ei|ther; &s;o that you may e&s;cape with only a few more mi&s;cellaneous ob&s;ervations, as u&s;ual.</P>
<P><HI>Pa&s;age</HI>&mdash;is a very good little &s;ea-port, well formed, and &s;hut up, by nature; now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Carraca company, who have almo&s;t a monopoly of the cocoa trade, which mu&s;t be very con&s;iderable: there is a va&s;t deal of chocolate drank in Europe. I have heard, that the country about Carraca is among the riche&s;t and be&s;t &s;ettled of any in Spani&s;h America.</P>
<P>Here is an iron mill, erected by D'Ara|gori. It produces about three hundred bars
<PB N="18" REF="24">

<HEAD><HI>LETTER III.</HI> Romantic Ruins and Situations. Strangers attached to Spain. Society of Arts. Good Conde. Indu&s;try.</HEAD>
<P>THEIR towns and villages, in the&s;e northern provinces, have generally &s;omething about them that is very romantic and intere&s;ting in &s;ituation and manner of building. Some retain a certain air of antique magnificence; but as they are too generally approaching to a &s;tate of ruin and decline, they &s;trike with a melancholy idea of &s;ome former better times, and the mind deplores the vici&s;&s;itudes of human greatne&s;s, and its productions. Ruins do, indeed, form the &s;triking features of this whole penin&s;ula: &s;o many old ca&s;tles, declining towns and man&s;ions, the &s;ad remains of former grandeur, &s;o frequently to be met with; together with the peculiar romantic
<PB N="20" REF="26">
humour and manners of the natives, all contribute to keep up the idea of this being the country of romance. I longed to re&s;tore &s;ome of their magnificent old man&s;ions to their original &s;tate. I believe one of the few plea&s;ures of travelling through Spain may con&s;i&s;t in indulging the fancy in this &s;pecies of ca&s;tle-building, in improving and beautifying the face of the country.</P>
<P>The bold and romantic &s;ituation of &s;everal of their little towns, in the&s;e two provinces, as Vergara, &amp;c. pendent on the &s;ides of rocky mountains, over a rapid &s;tream, among other bold and plea&s;ing &s;enti|ments, &s;ugge&s;ts to the fancy, that of a hardy and vigorous race of people, which is pre|&s;ently confirmed by &s;eeing the children care|le&s;sly climbing the &s;teep hills and precipices, and early employed in manly occupations.</P>
<P>But &s;o much old, and &s;o little new, even in the be&s;t provinces of Spain, is certainly a &s;trong &s;ymptom of decline, with what|ever confidence a few people about the court may flatter them&s;elves, and their
<PB N="21" REF="27">
good monarch, into notions of their pre&s;ent ri&s;ing &s;tate of pro&s;perity and advance|ment.</P>
<P>It is hard to account for that &s;ingular at|tachment which many of us foreigners, who come from better countries, contract for this of Spain, and having once lived here, makes us long to return to it as to a native land, and give a preference to the poverty and de&s;olation of this over the wealth and acquirements of more poli&s;hed nations: perhaps it could not be well ac|counted for, without leading you through the country, and &s;hewing you what it is we like. The warm predilection, ob&s;ervable in many of the Engli&s;h in particular, for this country, may proceed from &s;ome &s;ecret &s;ympathy, and &s;imilarity of character and ta&s;te; the &s;ame natural and original di&s;like of the French,&mdash;a &s;imilar turn of mind in many things, are obvious enough, and may help to form this kind of mental union: it is likewi&s;e to the powerful attractions of the &s;ex in Spain, that we may a&s;cribe much of this attachment,&mdash;to their peculiar graces,
<PB N="22" REF="28">
&s;pirit, and conver&s;ation: the footing of equality on which they live and work with the men in this country, is al&s;o remark|able.</P>
<P>I was highly plea&s;ed, you may be &s;ure, to find in the&s;e mountains, a &s;ociety and academy for the encouragement of u&s;eful arts and knowledge, lately founded on good and benevolent principles. They have their yearly meetings alternately at the capital of each of the&s;e three provinces, <HI>viz.</HI> at Vitoria, Vergara, and Bilbao. But embarra&s;&s;ed by the jealous and mi&s;|chievous &s;pirit of their government and religion, they are forced to proceed with too much caution in their choice of pro|fe&s;&s;ors, books, &s;ubjects; otherwi&s;e, &s;ome inqui&s;itor, informer, or friar, or perhaps &s;ome French influence at court, may de&s;troy all the intended fabric in its foundation.</P>
<P>Their &s;ucce&s;s likewi&s;e depends too much on the life of one man, the Conde de Pen~a Florida, the principal author and promoter of all the&s;e improvements. He is one of
<PB N="23" REF="29">
tho&s;e old-fa&s;hioned country gentlemen who prefer a country life to a town re&s;idence; he chu&s;es to live at home, upon his e&s;tate, and do all the good he can. Once a year, I under&s;tand, he goes to court. He has had influence with mo&s;t of the gentlemen of this country, to follow his example. By &s;uch active benevolence, and by inter|marriages, he &s;eems the father of a whole country. Surely, in life there cannot be a happier condition. His liberality &s;eldom appears in acts of mere charity, which generally &s;erves only to promote indolence and vice. It is by encouraging u&s;eful trades and manufactures, that he diffu&s;es, through the whole country, a &s;pirit of active in|du&s;try and emulation.</P>
<P>He is obliged to have prie&s;ts in his academy, and he &s;eems to have got one at the head of it, of as liberal a turn of mind as could be wi&s;hed. He was very happy to talk freely to us; a plea&s;ure which can &s;eldom be indulged in the&s;e countries, and which we know not how to appreciate, by its being already &s;o common among us.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="30">The Conde &s;ends his &s;ons to travel for real information, and chiefly in the u&s;eful arts. I found one of them at Paris, and hope I have prevailed on him to vi&s;it England, with &s;everal others of his countrymen, who are &s;tudying there, with great application and &s;ucce&s;s,&mdash;chiefly in chemi&s;try, natural or experimental philo&s;ophy, with the prac|tice of &s;ome of the mo&s;t u&s;eful trades. Another of the Conde's &s;ons was &s;ent to Sweden, to learn every thing concerning iron and &s;teel. But he unfortunately died, or the good Conde might, by this time, have &s;ucceeded in &s;ome more of his patrio|tic &s;chemes, particularly the making of &s;teel, to which this country is well adapted, as it produces all &s;orts of iron and charcoal.</P>
<P>He continues, however, indefatigable; and it is probable that &s;ome of his favourite projects may yet &s;ucceed, or, at lea&s;t, be begun, if he lives long enough. But as &s;uch men are very &s;carce in this country, it is not &s;o probable that his improvements may be taken up, and carried on, after his death:&mdash;&s;uch as making more roads, and
<PB N="25" REF="31">
rendering rivers navigable, forming and improving more harbours on their coa&s;t.</P>
<P>They already make &s;mall arms at Palen|cia, and have lately exported con&s;iderable quantities to our old friends, and new ene|mies, in America; and have now large orders from their own government. This, with &s;everal other &s;ymptoms, &s;hews clearly enough, what conduct we have yet long to expect from this nation.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER IV.</HI> Iron. Trades. Mu&s;ic. Timber. Bilbao. Wool. Clergy. Commerce. Bourbons. Smuggling. The Poor. Mr. Bowles. Roads.</HEAD>
<P>I AM glad that you approve of my dwell|ing more than u&s;ual on &s;uch &s;cenes, and little commencements of indu&s;try as this country exhibits. There are, in this mi&s;er|able world, but few of tho&s;e re&s;ting-places where one wi&s;hes to &s;top and contemplate the ri&s;e or infancy of human improve|ments, which is always more plea&s;ant than their old age or decline.</P>
<P>You know that iron is as yet almo&s;t the only export of this hardy race. It may amount to about 200,000 quintals a year. Their iron works are &s;mall, and &s;cattered over the country for the convenience of wood and charcoal, in the u&s;e of which,
<PB N="27" REF="33">
great oeconomy is ob&s;erved. I doubt if our new method of u&s;ing <HI>coke</HI> can produce &s;uch good iron as this. We vi&s;ited &s;everal of tho&s;e little works, and were there told, that the eight or ten men, u&s;ually employ|ed in each, can produce about eighty quin|tals of pig from the ore <HI>per</HI> week, for 5&frac12; reals <HI>per</HI> quintal; that the ore generally gives about one-third iron. This may &s;et you about inquiring concerning ours in England.</P>
<P>Such is the connexion of the arts, that one brings many others along with it. One good &s;taple commodity in a country will create a plenty in every thing el&s;e. This little bu&s;ine&s;s of iron has improved them in &s;everal other things, by creating a demand for them, as in agriculture, planting, weav|ing, and in &s;everal trades for tools.</P>
<P>When you vi&s;it this country, I would wi&s;h you to &s;top a while at Vergara, where, I think, you may be amply repaid for your time and trouble in climbing the&s;e moun|tains to get at it. This good Conde de
<PB N="28" REF="34">
Pen~a Florida has made the&s;e people mu&s;ical too. They now tran&s;late and act Italian operas among them&s;elves, and fill all the parts very tolerably, both of the &s;tage and orche&s;tra. This is probably of importance in civilizing a country. However well in|clined you may be to laugh at &s;uch things now-a-days, we have the wi&s;e&s;t men of antiquity on our &s;ide; and, I think, the moral effects of mu&s;ic are obvious even now, here, and el&s;ewhere, increa&s;ing and improving &s;ociability, humanity, and &s;ome of our be&s;t &s;entiments.</P>
<P>In the&s;e, and other mountainous parts of Spain, &s;ome good timber &s;till remains, owing to the difficulty of bringing it away. They now talk of making roads for that purpo&s;e; but I doubt the execution of mo&s;t Spani&s;h government projects. The&s;e poor mountaineers are the only people in Spain, who have indu&s;try and fore&s;ight enough to plant and replace the con&s;ump|tion. A large and good kind of pine or fir abounds yet in &s;ome parts of the&s;e northern mountains; above 6000, I was

told, have been found in a &s;pace of half a league &s;quare. They have lately been able to get &s;ome oak down to the Cavada and St. Ander; and &s;ome has been carried down the Ebro for Carthagena, which, by the way, is their mo&s;t convenient port and ar&s;enal for work. They likewi&s;e carry &s;ome timber from Sierra Morena, down the Guadalquivir, for Cadix. They cut up timber to great wa&s;te, u&s;ing large oaks for &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, and in general, &s;acrifice too much to &s;ecurity. Such has been their hi&s;tory in almo&s;t every thing. <HI>Too much caution,</HI> might be the Spani&s;h motto. Their works are generally too great, too &s;trong, too &s;ecure, but without &s;ufficient &s;cience, ta&s;te, or oeconomy.</P>
<P>Bilbao&mdash;an agreeable place, a pretty little river, and a fine hilly country,&mdash;but the town again in the wrong place; on the wrong &s;ide of the river, and &s;ubject to be overflowed. The inhabitants offer to change it them&s;elves, but the court of Madrid refu&s;es them leave to do it. Mo&s;t Spani&s;h towns have &s;ome &s;uch capital de|fect.
<PB N="30" REF="36">
There did belong to this port, before la&s;t war, about two hundred and fifty ve&s;&s;els; but they do not now amount to one hundred and twenty, though they have been ever &s;ince increa&s;ing. Such are the fruits they reap from their wars with England.</P>
<P>The wool exported here may be about 6000 bags <HI>per annum,</HI> of 50 <HI>lb.</HI> each. at about three reals <HI>per lb.</HI> But this export trade is now gradually moving to St. Ander, by order of the court, and is probably in con&s;equence of the jealou&s;y with which government begins to view the liberties and privileges of the&s;e provinces, as they begin to &s;hew &s;ymptoms of pro&s;perity. Some are gaining con&s;iderably here by our Ame|ricans, and they &s;eem to get more of their ready money than the French.</P>
<P>The&s;e northern Spaniards, ever active, hardy, generous, and free, have always been the be&s;t &s;oldiers and &s;ailors of the penin&s;ula. Their government is of the mixed kind, like all tho&s;e where there is any freedom left, and where each cla&s;s has
<PB N="31" REF="37">
&s;ome influence; but here, the nobles and the church have, as u&s;ual, been gaining more than their due &s;hare, particularly the latter; and I believe one of the greate&s;t ob&s;tructions in the&s;e provinces, to the pro|gre&s;s and pro&s;perity which might have been expected from their degree of political free|dom, has been their religion, and the in|fluence of their clergy, which is too great, and often tyrannically exerted. It is &s;een in their jealou&s;y of &s;trangers, ari&s;ing from an exce&s;&s;ive dread of whatever might en|danger the purity of the faith, or dimini&s;h their own power. Indeed, throughout Spain, there is nothing of importance can be done, but the church mu&s;t have a hand in it. I find, even here, that the clergy are ad|mitted to their council of commerce, which might be a very convenient and a bene|ficial in&s;titution, if the&s;e gentlemen did not, as u&s;ual, take the lead, and ob&s;truct its be&s;t operations.</P>
<P>The Dutch, French, and Germans, now furni&s;h Spain and Portugal with a number of articles of trade that u&s;ed to be &s;ent from
<PB N="32" REF="38">
England. May not this partly ari&s;e from a kind of pride, or commercial greatne&s;s in our countrymen, who, di&s;daining the &s;mall profits, and the bu&s;ine&s;s of retail, will all be great merchants? Our formerly nume|rous and indu&s;trious retailers are certainly dimini&s;hing, and we are gradually lo&s;ing the foreign &s;upply of many articles. How|ever, I find here yet one Engli&s;h ware|hou&s;e, with a tolerable a&s;&s;ortment of goods: but it is &s;oon to be given up, though almo&s;t the la&s;t of the kind remaining in Spain: whereas there u&s;ed to be one, at lea&s;t, in every principal town. In the more inland parts, many Engli&s;h things, that u&s;ed to be common, are now not to be found. Some knives were &s;hewn me, for common u&s;e, at 2 2/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> reals <HI>per</HI> dozen, from St. Etienne en Forein. Can your people at Birmingham; with all their machinery, furni&s;h them here &s;o cheap?</P>
<P>The jealou&s;y, I had almo&s;t &s;aid hatred, of the pre&s;ent Spani&s;h government to every thing Engli&s;h, appears &s;tronger every day. All the effects of this Bourbon government,
<PB N="33" REF="39">
which were &s;o wi&s;ely fore&s;een in the time of King William, we may expect, will gradually take place: and both the Spa|niards and we may long regret, that they had not then &s;pirit and union &s;ufficient to chu&s;e a king of their own nation, and a form of government of the right and ancient model, with &s;uch improvements as we could have taught them to intro|duce. Though the Spaniards do not yet quite readily obey, and imbibe all the Bourbon policy and prejudices, they will in time, and probably mu&s;t gradually con|form; and the progre&s;s is perceptible enough in our own memory.</P>
<P>Smuggling increa&s;es here, as u&s;ual, with the duties, which are almo&s;t annually aug|mented, on Engli&s;h commodities. It might increa&s;e &s;till more, if your u&s;ual diligence in the retail, and the enterpri&s;ing &s;pirit of your merchants, were not con&s;iderably abated. I believe this government will &s;ucceed in excluding all the mo&s;t im|portant branches of your trade from this country and its colonies; and the more
<PB N="34" REF="40">
readily, as you &s;eem to favour and a&s;&s;i&s;t them in it, by the fal&s;e policy of complai&s;|ance promoted by Mr. Grenville; a policy which will generally be more un&s;ucce&s;sful with this nation than with almo&s;t any other, in obtaining any commercial or political ad|vantages in return. This government may &s;ucceed &s;till better by the effects of a war: having once, by that means, &s;hut out your trade, they will more ea&s;ily keep it out: and this may be one of the objects they have in view by taking a part in this conte&s;t.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, if you are politically wi&s;e, you will &s;et this government down as your na|tural and irreconcilable enemy, and pre|pare to make the mo&s;t of that &s;tate of things which you cannot alter. And if you are commercially wi&s;e, you will &s;muggle all you can into their country and colonies. By the&s;e means, you will gain, or rather retain, the people, who are fond of all trade with the Engli&s;h, and you may always defy their government.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="41">Another good thing beyond what we ex|pected to find in this country is, at Pam|plona, a very tolerable police in the provi|&s;ion and management of their poor; one of the mo&s;t difficult parts of public oeco|nomy. They receive and provide for all that come, for a certain time, and, I be|lieve, a&s;&s;i&s;t them in their way to their re|&s;pective homes. If they could employ them, and extend this kind of e&s;tabli&s;h|ment throughout the country, it might be of great &s;ervice to the nation. This is originally, I believe, promoted by the clergy, who are generally very charitable in Spain. Though the plan partakes of the u&s;ual defects, and of tho&s;e incident to their order, we mu&s;t not condemn the whole becau&s;e &s;ome parts of it are imperfect. Their principal motive being the love of God, the good of the country, or the ad|vantage of the poor people them&s;elves, are not &s;ufficiently con&s;idered. But the&s;e de|fects are found to attend this branch of police in almo&s;t all countries, except, per|haps, in Holland. It is &s;aid, the Dutch have &s;ucceeded the be&s;t, in the mo&s;t e&s;&s;en|tial
<PB N="36" REF="42">
points of this branch, <HI>viz.</HI> by finding employment for their poor, and in making them work.</P>
<P>To &s;upply the wants of men, by any means independent of their own labour, is doing them, and the public, more harm than good, and will be only giving a pre|mium to promote poverty as a profe&s;&s;ion. When &s;ufficient employment for all the members, does not ari&s;e out of the nature of the &s;ociety, from the intere&s;t of indivi|duals, we may doubt if any public manage|ment can, in any other way, &s;upply the deficiency. Whatever &s;y&s;tem, or mode of &s;upply, is adopted, to find proper people who will be willing and able to apply &s;uf|ficiently to the admini&s;tration, or de&s;cend to manage the private intere&s;ts of people better than them&s;elves, will &s;till be difficult or impracticable in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;o|ciety. It will probably be always an object, either &s;o &s;mall as to fall under the direction of men too mean and intere&s;ted; or it will be too great, and too trouble&s;ome, to be well admini&s;tered by any men.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="43">To a&s;&s;i&s;t the poor with any good effect, it mu&s;t probably be done at their own homes (while they can have any home), in &s;upport of the dome&s;tic or natural &s;tate of &s;ociety. The bringing them from thence can &s;eldom an&s;wer any good pur|po&s;e. They can then only be formed into communities unnatural, inactive, and burden&s;ome to the public. Such forced &s;ocieties &s;hould never be attempted, till the natural are clearly proved to be in&s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e in hand, which is &s;eldom the ca&s;e. When forced to adopt them, for the purpo&s;es of war, education, or charity, we &s;ee their deficiencies, and they often fail in an&s;wering the ends propo&s;ed. The Romans, for the purpo&s;es, at once, of &s;e|curing conque&s;ts, defence, and cultivation, planted military colonies, wi&s;ely joining the natural with the military &s;tate of &s;o|ciety.</P>
<P>I had the plea&s;ure, at Bilbao, of meet|ing with hone&s;t old Bowles, who has writ|ten a &s;hort natural hi&s;tory of Spain. A plain &s;en&s;ible man of &s;cience; a rare thing.
<PB N="38" REF="44">
You will &s;ee his book, which may not in|tere&s;t you much in England, but may be an amu&s;ing companion in this country. I was &s;orry to di&s;cover that he has never been &s;o happy here as he was given to hope. Like mo&s;t &s;trangers who engage in the &s;er|vice of this nation, he is &s;orry for having dedicated his time to the vain attempt of being u&s;eful to it. The rude&s;t nations are always the mo&s;t jealous of foreigners. The civilization of a people is not impro|perly e&s;timated by the manner in which &s;trangers are u&s;ually received and treated among them.</P>
<P>I cannot quit the&s;e Ba&s;congada provinces without mentioning their roads, which they have executed nobly and oeconomi|cally, and in which the Spani&s;h govern|ment has, fortunately for them, had no|thing to do. The carrying roads zig-zag over &s;ome of their &s;teep mountains, as at Sierr&aacute; de Ordun~a, are really great and &s;tu|pendous works, at once u&s;eful and magni|ficent; while Spain &s;upinely looks on, as if a&s;hamed to be outdone, or too proud
<PB N="39" REF="45">
to imitate their example. For the&s;e twenty or thirty years pa&s;t, the wi&s;e coun&s;els of Madrid have been planning and making roads, and are only &s;till at the beginning of the bu&s;ine&s;s, having executed only a few leagues near the capital, and at the principal &s;ea-ports. They have not yet been able to take up the road from the&s;e frontiers, and carry it on, at lea&s;t, to Burgos, as they pro|po&s;ed and promi&s;ed.</P>

<P>WE now go on towards Galicia, fol|lowing along the coa&s;t this cour&s;e of mountains. You may conceive it a con|tinuation of the Pyrenees, terminating in Cape Fini&s;terre, and forming one of the great pieces of the charpente, or &s;keleton, of this penin&s;ula, which is compo&s;ed of a few of the&s;e curiou&s;ly connected ranges of mountains, and a few large plains between them. This range &s;eems like a great wall, or mole of mountains thrown together, in a manner as if intended to keep the &s;ea out of the great plain of Old Ca&s;tile, behind it. It &s;eems now to &s;eparate comfort, indu&s;try, and activity, from &s;loth, dirt, and poverty.
<PB N="41" REF="47">
The countries it comprehends are Navarre, the three Ba&s;congada provinces, Mons E&s;|pino&s;a, A&s;turias, and Galicia. It then turns to the &s;outh to form and cut off Por|tugal.</P>
<P>But before we proceed, I mu&s;t try to re|collect &s;ome particulars. In Bi&s;caya, I met with Anciola, who made the hammered iron cannon. He &s;eems to think, he has now conquered all the difficulties, and that it would be ea&s;ier, on another trial, to &s;uc|ceed yet better. He has made a 3 pounder of 3 quintals weight,&mdash;an 8 pounder of 8 ditto,&mdash;a 24 pounder of 39 ditto,&mdash;and a 32 pounder of 52 ditto. He &s;ays, they can now be made to &s;tand all &s;orts of proof. But we mu&s;t yet doubt the po&s;&s;ibility of their being made all equally to be depended on, or of each being equally &s;o throughout, till they have much more experience of them. Doubtle&s;s both the metals now in u&s;e, ca&s;t iron and gun metal, are defective for the purpo&s;es of artillery, while tho&s;e of the one kind often bur&s;t, and the others melt; yet, I fear, it will be long before we
<PB N="42" REF="48">
find a metal without one or other of tho&s;e defects.</P>
<P>I am here farther fortified in my prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion in favour of mountaineers. From the Mons E&s;pino&s;a are generally cho&s;en the guards for the king's per&s;on, and for &s;everal other mo&s;t confidential &s;ervices. The A&s;turian &s;ervants are everywhere preferred for the &s;ame qualities of honour and fidelity.</P>
<P>St. Ander and the Cavada form a very &s;pacious, noble port, and might be much improved. But its being rather ea&s;ily attacked, may have occa&s;ioned this over-cautious government to neglect it, and the important u&s;es that might be made of it. It was here that Mon&s;. Gautier, their new French builder, con&s;tructed his fir&s;t &s;hips. I am told, by judges, that they are too crank and fine, and do not carry their lower guns high enough out of the water. Though he has &s;ince built &s;ome very good &s;hips, mo&s;t of their marine corps, I find, do &s;till think that none of his are equal to

Their proof is too &s;evere.&mdash;<HI>Over-caution</HI> again. In proving their guns, they fix the breech in a rock, to prevent the recoil, by which peculiar &s;trains and vibrations are probably given to parts of the piece, that never take place on actual &s;ervice. Bowles &s;ays, that the mo&s;t material defect of their pre&s;ent foundery, is the want of the u&s;ual mixture of their different ores: they u&s;ed to mix one-third of Somoro&s;tro, their fa|mous mine for &s;oft iron, which, it &s;eems, is now neglected.</P>
<P>Among contending opinions, in military as well as other matters, we cannot expect the be&s;t always to prevail: but where we &s;ee the wor&s;t frequently adopted, to trace the cau&s;e we mu&s;t look upwards: and we mu&s;t not be &s;urpri&s;ed to find great deficiencies, in a nation &s;o &s;ituated and circum&s;tanced; e&s;pecially when it is con&s;idered how much is now expected

from men in the higher military &s;tations, &s;ince the late advances in &s;cience, and in all the arts relating to war, in which their nation, now &s;o depre&s;&s;ed and &s;eparat|ed from the re&s;t of Europe, mu&s;t be left behind.</P>
<P>Without a head equal to judge and em|ploy the different merits and talents of the &s;ubordinate members, however great tho&s;e merits may be, their be&s;t effects will be lo&s;t. Perhaps there is only one effectual way of doing this, that which the King of Pru&s;&s;ia has taken, by making him&s;elf acquainted with the principles of every thing,&mdash;with the duty of every rank and employ,&mdash;with the leading rules of every kind of work, trade, or profe&s;&s;ion,&mdash;and with the per&s;onal merits and character of all his officers: all which he accompli&s;hes in the mo&s;t direct and ma&s;terly way, not through the u&s;ual road of dulne&s;s, called application.</P>
<P>We now proceed on our difficult but delightful journey, often along the &s;hore, by narrow paths, on dreadful precipices,
<PB N="46" REF="52">
with the additional horror of having tho&s;e places pointed out to us, where men and mules, &amp;c. have fallen down, and have been da&s;hed to pieces before they reached the di&s;tant ocean beneath.</P>
<P>The&s;e A&s;turias pre&s;ent us with new and noble &s;cenes and pro&s;pects, in a &s;tyle of beauty again different from the Bi&s;cayan&mdash; mountains more &s;teep, &s;ublime, and mag|nificent; more frequently cut with little rapid rivers, and narrow vales, overhung with rocks and woods. The mind is in|tere&s;ted and elevated, and in moving along, anxiou&s;ly pur&s;ues, with alternate hopes and fears, the changing &s;cenery &mdash; the coa&s;t inter&s;ected with little bays and mouths of rivers, and &s;tudded with rocky promon|tories; &s;almon fi&s;heries, &s;cattered villages, romantically &s;ituated, though few and poor, diver&s;ify the pro&s;pects.</P>
<P>Great variety of &s;trata, marbles, and ores, appear in the precipices. There mu&s;t be mines worth working here. The people are &s;trong and ru&s;tic, though not &s;o
<PB N="47" REF="53">
numerous, nor &s;o indu&s;trious, as the Bi&s;|cayan,&mdash; vi&s;ibly a different race, with more pride and indolence. I could here conceive a &s;trong re&s;emblance to the old Roman faces. The cau&s;e may be traced in their hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Several of the&s;e bays and rivers might be made tolerable &s;ea-ports, with little labour; and probably, &s;ome manufactures of the &s;impler kinds of indu&s;try might be introduced here with advantage. The&s;e are, perhaps, now the only provinces in Spain that are capable of it; the re&s;t have execeded that period; money having become among them too cheap or plenty. So that, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, Spain cannot el&s;ewhere force any manufacture that will be capable of contending with foreign indu&s;try, by which &s;he will be under&s;old in foreign markets, and thereby the chief motive and &s;upport of the indu&s;try &s;he is trying to in|troduce, are cut off. To form a flouri&s;h|ing manufactory requires a foreign market. Home con&s;umption, and particularly that
<PB N="48" REF="54">
of Spain, will be in&s;ufficient for the pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>To improve a country, I conceive that &s;ome degree of liberty and &s;ecurity mu&s;t be fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed, and then in|du&s;try, which is the real riches, will gra|dually, of it&s;elf, follow and produce its own &s;igns, money, &s;tock, and credit. Whereas money, or any other of the &s;igns, or arbitrary mea&s;ure of riches, poured into a country before that period, will not pro|mote but prevent indu&s;try, and tend to impoveri&s;h the people by dimini&s;hing their exertions. When they awake, and di&s;|cover that money is neither food nor rai|ment, &mdash;that they have been led to mi&s;take the &s;ign for the &s;ub&s;tance, and have been only gathering the fallen and peri&s;hable fruit, while they neglected the tree that produced it,&mdash;it is then too late to contend with the e&s;tabli&s;hed indu&s;try of ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">per countries. From tho&s;e they will continue to be &s;up|plied for their money, as long as they have it. Their cu&s;toms, manners, and habits of life, will then be formed on this
<PB N="49" REF="55">
arrangement. We know that men, in general, will work only &s;o far as they are forced to it by nece&s;&s;ity, and the people of this nation will be forced to it at lea&s;t as late as any others. But during all this time the arts vani&s;h, and the country is depopulated. Thus we may fancy and trace the decline of Spain.</P>
<P>In the&s;e provinces, however, where money is not &s;een to be &s;o plentiful, and materials may be had, a &s;pirit of indu&s;try might be rai&s;ed by tho&s;e who under|&s;tand the principles and the nature of it, but not by monopolies, prohibitions, or exclu&s;ive privileges; nor by royal manufactories, on great and expen&s;ive plans at fir&s;t, where jobs and &s;uperintendance generally eat up all the profits: yet the&s;e are the only methods hitherto devi&s;ed by this government for that purpo&s;e, and being &s;o conformable to their character and de&s;igns, it is not probable they can &s;oon advance far beyond tho&s;e ideas in arts and policy.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="56">This government &s;eems not to know, that the proper means of improvement are wanting, or deficient throughout the coun|try: that there are no country gentlemen, or middle ranks, nor &s;ufficient capitals to undertake or a&s;&s;i&s;t in any great or u&s;eful improvements. The great proprietors are detained at court. Nor do they know, that &s;mall and rude beginnings are generally the be&s;t, and that nature has de&s;tined every thing, indu&s;try, invention, legi&s;lation, &s;tock, credit, &amp;c. to go through a progre&s;s and gradation.</P>
<P>But where pride and indolence are the inveterate habits of both government and people, and the higher cla&s;&s;es are become unfit for bu&s;ine&s;s, there can be but little hopes of the return of indu&s;try, or of any of tho&s;e great and patriotic exertions which, under their ancient con&s;titution, before they fell a victim to de&s;poti&s;m, ani|mated and enriched the nation, and through the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive reigns of &s;everal princes, threatened Europe with too powerful a &s;u|periority.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="57">Full of tho&s;e romantic ideas, and plan|ning, as I rode along, various &s;chemes of improvement, it &s;truck me what a noble employment it would be for a prince of A&s;turias to be inve&s;ted with the actual admini&s;tration of the&s;e provinces, which might, at the &s;ame time, promote the hap|pine&s;s of tho&s;e people, and &s;erve him as an apprentice&s;hip in the art of governing a kingdom.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER VI.</HI> Rivadeo. Winds. Provincial Characters and Di&s;tinctions. Galicia. Government. Marine.</HEAD>
<P>TO enter Galicia, we cro&s;s at Rivadeo, a large inlet of the &s;ea, the mouth of a river, and a noble &s;pacious port. It might be much improved, by moving &s;ome &s;and-banks, and perhaps by moles and em|banking to confine the &s;tream. There was once an idea of making Rivadeo a king's port, and &s;ome doubts whether Vigo, Ferrol, or it, would an&s;wer mo&s;t of the purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>Here are the ruins of a linen manufac|tory: &s;everal having been lately attempted in this province, but without effect, by government, on their u&s;ual impracticable &s;cale and manner.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="59">We waited here two days, literally, for a fair wind to go on by land. The&s;e mountainous countries are frequently tor|mented, as they &s;tyle it, with high winds, which de&s;troy their little crops, and throw down mules, travellers, hou&s;es, trees, &amp;c. I believe mo&s;t of the&s;e high cape countries and penin&s;ulas that project into the ocean, are more &s;ubject to &s;torms than the inland plains. They here probably attract more than their proportion of the clouds and rains, &s;o much wanted in the interior parts of this kingdom. The northern parts of Spain may be con&s;idered as a fine cli|mate; they are rather &s;ubject to rain, and &s;ome &s;torms, but the atmo&s;phere being clear, and the fair weather plea&s;ant, the country is healthy.</P>
<P>Though there are &s;ome points of national character, and a manner, that more or le&s;s run through all the different inhabitants of this nation, as a certain appearance of gra|vity, and &s;teady equanimity of behaviour, even when they are mo&s;t facetious; though a &s;amene&s;s of ta&s;te, amu&s;ements, and pa&s;|&s;ions,
<PB N="54" REF="60">
prevail; yet there are obviou&s;ly di&s;tinct races of people. The northern, the middle or Ca&s;tilian, and the &s;outhern provinces, are plainly different characters. Much might be written on the&s;e di&s;tinctions, and yet not be very u&s;eful or intelligible to tho&s;e who have not &s;een the country. The Catalan is probably the mo&s;t indu&s;trious and active of the whole, but pa&s;&s;ionate and variable. This character of pa&s;&s;ion and &s;en&s;ibility, ari&s;ing from a kind of irritabi|lity of the mind or frame, runs through the &s;outhern provinces, and &s;eems in general, I think, to follow the &s;un throughout the world. Though there are frequently &s;trong &s;hades of difference in character between neighbouring nations and provinces in the &s;ame latitude, as in this nation between the Catalan, Valencian, Andalu&s;ian; there is likewi&s;e more re&s;emblance than they them&s;elves chu&s;e to perceive; for, like mo&s;t neighbouring countries, they only &s;ee and di&s;like each other's faults and differences.</P>
<P>This Galicia is again a different kind of country from the la&s;t, and though a con|tinuation
<PB N="55" REF="61">
of the &s;ame range of mountains, the&s;e are of a different &s;hape, &s;oil, and compo&s;ition, and inhabited by a di&s;tinct race of people. Other nations are divided into provinces arbitrarily, but Spain is &s;o by nature. This is generally effected by &s;ome remarkable rivers or mountains. The&s;e divi&s;ions of nature have been former|ly &s;eparate kingdoms, and more populous than at pre&s;ent; though all accounts of former population &s;hould be received with doubts and allowances.</P>
<P>The&s;e Gallegos &s;eem mo&s;tly poor and ragged, are rather a &s;mall or &s;hort race of people, and have a &s;trong re&s;emblance to the pea&s;antry of &s;ome of the French pro|vinces. I fancy they are rendered &s;hort and thick by the cu&s;tom of carrying burdens on their heads, particularly the women, who bear very heavy loads in that manner, and often carry the men acro&s;s the rivers on their heads in a ba&s;ket.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="62">You know this province, uniting its forces with tho&s;e of Prince Henry of Bur|gundy, conquered Portugal from the Moors. There is &s;till a great re&s;emblance between the Portugue&s;e and the&s;e people in figure, manners, names, and language.</P>
<P>They are tolerably indu&s;trious, or rather laborious, but without much &s;pirit or &s;kill in their indu&s;try. The country is rather populous, and mo&s;t of their mountains are in &s;ome degree of cultivation. They root and cut up the furze and bru&s;hwood with a hoe, an implement which they u&s;e much, and with &s;ome dexterity, though it is not &s;o good as that u&s;ed in Bi&s;caya. They then plow the land thus cleared, with a couple of &s;mall, poor oxen, or cows, and a mi&s;erable little plough that co&s;ts four or five &s;hillings. Though laborious, their poverty ob&s;tructs their improvements. They labour much to produce a little rye on grounds that would give them better things, as pota|toes, and gra&s;&s;es for their poor &s;tarved cattle. In &s;ome of their lower lands, they breed a tolerable race, of which they &s;end
<PB N="57" REF="63">
many into Spain. They have there, for winter food, &s;ome good turnips. From their good lands they get three crops in two years, rye, Indian corn, and turnips; but the&s;e are poor, and wear out the &s;oil, as neither fallows, manure, nor &s;ufficient tillings are u&s;ed. In &s;ome places, they turn water on the declivities for gra&s;s, but with little &s;kill or oeconomy; drowning one acre with water that would &s;erve ten. This produces a coar&s;e rank gra&s;s, like ru&s;hes.</P>
<P>We Engli&s;hmen, my good friend, mu&s;t vi&s;it poor countries in order to know how little food will &s;uffice for either the human or brute creation to &s;upport mere exi&s;tence. That they &s;hould here lo&s;e numbers of their cattle from want, is not &s;o &s;urpri&s;ing, as that &s;o many &s;hould &s;urvive the winter, with &s;uch &s;canty provi&s;ion for them. But I mean not to be diffu&s;e, or deal in particulars. It is only general conclu&s;ions I wi&s;h to give you.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="64">Population is certainly not the only cri|terion of the riches or &s;trength of a coun|try. The character and qualities of the in|habitants are &s;urely of importance, as well as their numbers. What would be the u&s;e, for example, of the highe&s;t popula|tion, if half were beggars? If the idle &s;hould amount to &s;uch a number as to require mo&s;t of the &s;urplus labour of tho&s;e who work, what revenue would be collected for the &s;tate? Yet this &s;eems nearly the ca&s;e in &s;ome parts of Spain; and hence the difficulty of levying any taxes on the land, or its produce. Nothing but the rapacity of the Catholic church, and the great influence of their clergy over the minds of this &s;uper&s;titious people, could make the tithes and religious contributions &s;o productive as they are found to be in Spain.</P>
<P>Galicia however, though poor, is of great importance to Spain, particularly in two chief articles of export, cattle and people. The la&s;t annually emigrate in great numbers to Spain and Portugal, where they become
<PB N="59" REF="65">
exceedingly u&s;eful in agriculture, and a variety of menial &s;ervices, which the poore&s;t ragged natives of tho&s;e countries are too proud and indolent to perform. Forty or fifty thou&s;and of the&s;e Gallegos are com|puted to be thus employed. Some of them return with a little money; and what does not go to the church, is hoarded, and often buried. They cannot bring them|&s;elves to part with any of it, even for the certain profit of improving their own lands, and increa&s;ing their income. This, and &s;ome other unnatural habits of avarice, &s;ufficiently &s;hew that they are, and have long been, oppre&s;&s;ed, probably by both church and &s;tate.</P>
<P>The con&s;tant export or emigration of their people may be one cau&s;e of their population, and of the fecundity of their women, who are not afraid, as el&s;ewhere, of having children. But it would be dif|ficult to make &s;ome Spaniards comprehend that the export of any thing could po&s;&s;ibly increa&s;e its produce.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="66">There has been too great and too &s;udden an influx of money here al&s;o, from various &s;ources, as well from the colonies, in com|mon with the re&s;t of the nation, as from the king's works at Ferrol and Corun~a, and from having opened the&s;e ports to the Ha|vannah and Buenos Ayres. They now want to introduce manufactures, when it is too late and impracticable. This influx &s;eems to impede in&s;tead of promoting agriculture. Be&s;ides, the produce here &s;eems to be limited by the nature of the &s;oil, and by the character of the people, and does not, as in mo&s;t other countries, increa&s;e with the demand. From former plenty, there is now a &s;carcity of every thing but money.</P>
<P>Many of the effects of bad govern|ment can hardly be fore&s;een, nor be ea&s;ily accounted for when they happen. In the di&s;tance of a few leagues, I found the price of labour nearly doubled. About Mondonedo, four reals <HI>per</HI> day,
<PB N="61" REF="67">
and about Ferrol, &s;even and eight reals. There are &s;imilar changes in the prices of provi&s;ions, and e&s;pecially of corn, in &s;mall di&s;tances, and in a very &s;hort time. The variations within the year are &s;eldom le&s;s than double, or two to one, and often more, in &s;pite of their <HI>ta&s;as,</HI> or a&s;&s;izes, and all their arbitrary laws and regulations to fix tho&s;e prices.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;ubjects not unde&s;erving your &s;tudy and ob&s;ervation. You will probably find, that this government is not con&s;tituted &s;o as to di&s;cover, or &s;uf|ficiently to care, how things are con|nected in this world, as in a chain. They ignorantly detach an indeterminate number of the links, and are &s;urpri&s;ed to find them&s;elves in an error when they come to the re&s;ult. Indeed, tho&s;e &s;ecret con|nections are not yet well under&s;tood by any of us. We often &s;ee that the pretended and meddling encouragements of govern|ment, even on our own &s;uppo&s;ed good principles, do more harm than good.
<PB N="62" REF="68">
They little know or &s;u&s;pect here, for ex|ample, that they cannot probably have even a good pair of &s;hoes made in their country, without changing its government and religion.</P>
<P>Of Ferrol, and their marine department, I can &s;ay but little. We cannot examine nor inquire into the&s;e particulars, without giving umbrage. The natural curio&s;ity of a traveller in this country, is often cru&s;hed in its infancy by a degree of jealou&s;y in the government, not to be met with in any other nation in Europe. If you &s;hould be more fortunate, and, by proper recom|mendations, procure acce&s;s to &s;ee and in|quire, you will then di&s;cover that the fol|lowing ob&s;ervations are founded.</P>
<P>In their public works as well as mea|&s;ures, they follow daily, more and more, the coun&s;els of their new friends the French, who&s;e ab&s;urdities, as u&s;ual, they heighten in their imitations. Mo&s;t of the great public works in Spain have been, and
<PB N="63" REF="69">
will probably continue to be, &s;ubject to great changes and variations. The natural uncer|tainty of engineering, and the diver&s;ity of opinions among different and &s;ucceeding engineers, will probably co&s;t this country fully as much as it has done mo&s;t other nations.</P>
<P>Spain will have every thing too great, and can therefore fini&s;h nothing; her works, her defences, thus remain more imperfect, and &s;he is le&s;s &s;ecure than if a mediocrity had been ob&s;erved, better &s;uited to her &s;ituation, funds, and abilities.</P>
<P>From what we can learn of her late marine regulations, &s;ome of them &s;eem &s;oon to threaten the extinction of all good &s;hip-builders and &s;ea-officers. The fir&s;t are all to be land engineers, <HI>&agrave; la Fran|&ccedil;oi&s;e,</HI> formed by theory, without practice, and without ever handling a tool: &s;o that they mu&s;t probably have their education in France. The &s;ea-officers are al&s;o to be formed chiefly by an education on &s;hore.
<PB N="64" REF="70">
The pre&s;ent Guardias Marinas (mid&s;hip|men) are mo&s;tly young men, full grown, who have never been at &s;ea: and the few who have lately been &s;ent thither, have kept their beds mo&s;t part of the voyage. Of the three parts of a &s;ea education, they have a chance of getting a part of one. Tho&s;e three parts, I con&s;ider to be, fir&s;t, The &s;ea habits, and gaining a ta&s;te for the profe&s;&s;ion, which can only be &s;e|cured by going early to &s;ea; &s;econd, the practical knowledge and abilities; and third, the theory, of which la&s;t they may here gain a portion. Few, however, at any &s;chool, advance far in &s;tudies that are merely &s;peculative, and when they do, they are but little advanced in their pro|fe&s;&s;ion. In our way of formation to a &s;ea life, if we mi&s;s one thing, we may gain another, and &s;eldom entirely fail in the two fir&s;t and mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential parts of a &s;ea education.</P>
<P>Perhaps we ought &s;o far to conde&s;cend to follow our neighbours, as to put a little
<PB N="65" REF="71">
more theory in our &s;ea education. A good &s;choolma&s;ter on board of each &s;hip of war, &s;eems to be one of the few e&s;&s;entials that requires to be more attended to. And perhaps, too, our &s;ea-officers (who are not yet &s;ufficiently military) &s;hould command the marines. The&s;e two regulations would tend to improve and increa&s;e three valuable &s;ets of people, of &s;ingular importance to us, <HI>viz.</HI> &s;ea-officers, &s;choolma&s;ters, and marines.</P>
<P>They have had here, for &s;everal years, &s;ome good Engli&s;h in&s;truments, to take the longitude of the&s;e capes, &amp;c. procured by George Juan; but they have not been able to fix or u&s;e them.

<P>THOSE who wi&s;h to know Spain and Spaniards, mu&s;t fir&s;t re&s;ide among them, to learn the language; then tra|ver&s;e the country, and make &s;ome &s;tay at different places, which may be marked out.

Without the language, you can expect but little knowledge of this people, and le&s;s &s;atisfaction. Their con|ver&s;ation will be the be&s;t part of your en|tertainment,
<PB N="67" REF="73">
and is far beyond what you might expect from a people &s;o &s;ecluded and circum&s;tanced as they are.</P>
<P>Do not always believe the French when they talk of Spain or Spaniards. They generally di&s;like and mi&s;repre&s;ent them. They &s;eem wilfully to mi&s;under&s;tand the meaning and character of this nation, and have no ta&s;te for their exqui&s;ite wit and humour, nor for their mu&s;ic, their mirth, or for their noble and beautiful language, all far &s;uperior to their own. Indeed, the French never arrive at &s;peaking the Spani&s;h, &s;o as to have or give any idea of its true grace and energy.</P>
<P>This &s;en&s;ible people mu&s;t &s;urely have made greater advances in the common im|provements that lately &s;urround them, and mu&s;t have more nearly kept pace with the re&s;t of Europe, and particularly with France, &s;ince their clo&s;e connection with that na|tion, if there had not been &s;ome political or Bourbon foul play, employed to prevent it: a proceeding founded, perhaps, on

that fal&s;e policy of keeping them more dependent on France. The dependence of poverty and ignorance, however flatter|ing to national vanity, can never be equally &s;atisfactory, or beneficial, with the friend&s;hip of a rich, indu&s;trious, and well-informed nation.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, tho&s;e very means, this confined and in&s;idious policy, by which they fancy the connection is &s;ecured, may be the very cau&s;e of breaking it. Any &s;ubordination between nations, or &s;eparate &s;ocieties (which can &s;o &s;eldom be ju&s;t to each other), cannot long be borne by the inferior, nor ever be la&s;ting or &s;ecure. Even actual force can|not always &s;ecure it. There would be a degree of wi&s;dom in &s;ome certain &s;trokes of political genero&s;ity and ju&s;tice, which might have effects as yet unknown in the political world. Nations would &s;ucceed much better by mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance, than by trying to pull each other down. Although this connection between France and Spain &s;eems now fixed for a long time to come, yet &s;everal things
<PB N="69" REF="75">
may be pu&s;hed too far, old antipathies revived, and effects produced that may tend to di&s;&s;olve the connection when lea&s;t expected: but I am &s;orry to &s;ee, that you do not &s;eem in England, of late, to watch and under&s;tand tho&s;e political mat|ters. Foreign politics, I fear, is not your <HI>fort.</HI></P>
<P>To &s;earch for the cau&s;es of the late general decline of Spain, and of the &s;low advances of every thing attempted to re&s;tore her, might be an in&s;tructive inquiry; but it would be like writing their hi&s;tory. There is probably as much to be learned from the fall as from the ri&s;e of nations, if nations could learn, or take example, from each other. Le&s;&s;ons might be found here ap|plicable enough to other kingdoms; as there &s;eems to be &s;till the &s;ame tendency throughout the re&s;t of Europe, from the modern rapacious &s;pirit of commerce and gain, to follow the &s;teps of Spain, and to gra&s;p at trade and riches till they &s;queeze them to death. Deceitful peace &s;ucceeds commercial wars. What contradictions,

even in terms! Pedlars and plunderers &s;eem to govern Europe by turns. Nations and individuals are equally fond of monopolies, which generally ruin them at la&s;t, and di&s;|like all competition, which, neverthele&s;s, does them infinite &s;ervice. Both men and nations require competitors, or they would go to &s;leep, like the Spaniards.</P>
<P>You &s;ee I am naturally enough inclin|ed to follow your advice, and indulge in general reflections, in &s;earch of truths of &s;ome importance, in which indeed I wi&s;h chiefly to deal. They may contain more novelty and originality, by my being, as it were, out of the world. Not that I have any great confidence in thoughts or &s;y&s;tems fabricated in retirement, which may &s;ometimes a&s;&s;i&s;t the fancy, but &s;eldom the judgment. It requires the frequent col|li&s;ion of &s;ociety, the freedom of conver&s;a|tion, and the kind offices of friend&s;hip, to purge and refine our &s;peculations, and render them fit for u&s;e. I meant to give you &s;ome general ideas, &s;uppo&s;ing the par|ticulars already &s;ufficiently known, and &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

Any detail of their religious or &s;uper&s;titious ceremo|nies, I &s;hould think rather unworthy of your attention. Their influence on the people is of con&s;equence, and I therefore wi&s;h you to be able to perceive and detect it. Their cu&s;toms, amu&s;ements, vi&s;its, dre&s;s, food, &amp;c. you will find in various travellers, as Clarke, Baretti, and others.</P>

One cannot help wi&s;hing he had &s;een and examined Spain and Spaniards, before he wrote about them; as he has not, I think, always ju&s;t ideas of their pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, nor probable future condition, character, and progre&s;s. He takes &s;ome pains not to di&s;oblige the Spaniards, and to forgive, or palliate, many of their mo&s;t atrocious cruelties.</P>
<P>Some of the natives here, the be&s;t ac|quainted with their colonies and hi&s;tory, have confe&s;&s;ed to me, that they think even the Abb&eacute; Raynal's book nearer the truth.

<P>You mu&s;t beware of tru&s;ting too much to books, and to what is called learning, as well as of the ambition to become an author too &s;oon your&s;elf. But I think it is to be feared, that book-making may fall into a &s;ort of di&s;credit, and be too much de&s;pi&s;ed by &s;ome who have gone the farthe&s;t in u&s;e|ful knowledge; who have, as it were, left books behind, and are not much inclined to write what they know, indolently leav|ing it to the profe&s;&s;edly learned, to the de|&s;igning or intere&s;ted, to tho&s;e of middling capacity, who have more patience, more vanity, or &s;ome &s;ini&s;ter motives: &s;ome of the&s;e, encouraged by book&s;ellers, &s;tand

<HEAD><HI>LETTER VIII.</HI> Bowles. Manufactories. Pontz. Hi&s;tory. Letters. Campomanes. Knowledge, and u&s;eful Arts.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN you come to Spain, make it in your way, if you can, to &s;ee Bowles. You will probably find him in his favourite province of Bi&s;caya. You may have read his book. I believe it may be depended on, as far as it goes. This nation is not yet in a condition to profit by reading, nor can we believe that their government means they &s;hould, till we &s;ee other means employed, be&s;ides that of giving them books. But even the&s;e are di&s;tributed with a very &s;paring hand. The complete chain of u&s;eful knowledge, and the freedom of re&s;earch, will probably long be excluded by inqui&s;itorial tyranny. Where philo&s;ophers, and their books, are con&s;idered as dangerous, they can have few
<PB N="77" REF="83">
or no good effects; and we &s;hould not be &s;urpri&s;ed to hear of Mr. B&mdash; being in the Inqui&s;ition for the pains he has already taken. I wi&s;h he was as well acquainted with his native country, England, as he &s;eems to be with Spain and Germany.</P>
<P>It is rather &s;urpri&s;ing to find him, and mo&s;t of the writers of this country, always recommending manufactories to its inhabitants. Many of tho&s;e manufactories are probably impracticable in its pre&s;ent &s;tate, except a few of the mo&s;t &s;imple kinds, as a proper beginning. One trade often requires a hundred others in order to carry it on; of the&s;e half would not be found in the country, nor could be brought into it. They ought fir&s;t to produce materials and hands, and perhaps &s;hould begin by encouraging the ex|port of tho&s;e very materials which they are always prohibiting, by which means they dimini&s;h the produce, the population, agriculture, and indu&s;try, of their country. I have heard that their mini&s;ter, the Conde de Heranda, had &s;ome right ideas on
<PB N="78" REF="84">
the&s;e &s;ubjects; that he intended promot|ing, at fir&s;t, a few &s;imple &s;taple fabrics, and only the produce of the raw materials in others. But you know he was not per|mitted to go on.</P>
<P>Bowles, you will perceive, evades treat|ing much of the practice and actual &s;tate of the u&s;eful arts, and leaves it to Pontz, who hitherto confines him&s;elf mo&s;tly to the trifling remains of the fine arts; and having caught the rage of writing and de&s;cribing, in&s;tead of giving drawings of every thing, as at fir&s;t propo&s;ed, his volumes go on in|crea&s;ing, while the mo&s;t important articles of information are not yet touched upon by either.</P>
<P>You are right in reading Mariana, his continuators, and others of their hi&s;tori|ans, though mo&s;t of them are rather tedi|ous and unintere&s;ting; at lea&s;t they may appear &s;o, till you &s;ee the country. You will find mo&s;t of them named in Antoni, Geddes, Clerke, Robert&s;on, &amp;c. But much of the information which you are
<PB N="79" REF="85">
collecting from books, and from me, I fear you will neither comprehend nor retain near &s;o well as by acquiring it here on the &s;pot.</P>
<P>Your letters of recommendation for Madrid, &amp;c. are very proper and nece&s;&s;ary in this country, though we have always found the circular letter and bills of Sir R. Herries and Co. to be quite &s;ufficient for all the purpo&s;es both of credit and intro|duction, wherever we went; and have, in con&s;equence, been treated with all the kind|ne&s;s and ho&s;pitality that almo&s;t any other let|ters could have procured<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>As a convincing proof of the merits and utility of Sir Robert's plan, we find Me&s;&s;rs.

However, recom|mendations to great and learned men may likewi&s;e be of u&s;e; and that to Campomanes will an&s;wer &s;everal good purpo&s;es. You &s;hould fir&s;t read his books. You will find him full of u&s;eful knowledge, though per|haps a little too much confined to reading and to French &s;y&s;tems, and hence a little

Though one of the be&s;t informed o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their politicians, he is &s;till attached to &s;ome of the old prejudices; as the nece&s;&s;ity o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;trict prohibitions, and of making Spain a manufacturing country, almo&s;t before it is peopled and cultivated,&mdash;of watching and trimming the balance of trade, expecting government to regulate every thing, and enter into details for which they very be&s;t kinds are inadequate, and &s;till more the wor&s;t. He &s;uppo&s;es that public edicts, and oeconomical &s;ocieties, can reform, can peo|ple, and enrich the country, though they have had already &s;ufficient experience of the inefficacy of all tho&s;e methods. How|ever, he improves as he writes. He &s;eems candid and liberal enough to open his eyes by degrees, and his la&s;t publica|tions are always the be&s;t. He has &s;et his countrymen right in many e&s;&s;entials; and
<PB N="81" REF="87">
when he comes to read A. Smith, and &s;ee &s;till more of the in&s;ufficiency of their pre&s;ent form of government, he may be convinced how little can be done or ex|pected, without changing its con&s;titution. We &s;hould not have expected to &s;ee him prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with quite &s;o many national prejudices; nor to find him &s;o warm an apologi&s;t for the Spani&s;h enormities, cruel|ties, and rapacity, in their American con|que&s;ts. It is too late:&mdash;the facts are too well atte&s;ted to be called in que&s;tion now. Nor &s;hould we have &s;uppo&s;ed him &s;ub|ject to &s;o many of their political errors, &mdash;as tho&s;e of aiming at things incompa|tible, &mdash;at the character and effects, at once, of par&s;imony and of luxury,&mdash;of poverty and riches. They want the nation to be &s;ober, temperate, oeconomical, and at the &s;ame time, active and enterpri&s;ing in pur&s;uit of the objects of ta&s;te and plea&s;ure; forgetting that arts and luxury mu&s;t afford mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance. But, notwith&s;tanding all this, he has great merit, and is rather lo&s;t or mi&s;placed
<PB N="82" REF="88">
here; and he may yet have the honour of ending his days in the Inqui&s;ition which, in this country, is perhaps a te&s;t of the merit of a man, as burning is likely to be of a book. I hear he is one of the four already marked out by that tribunal for puni&s;hment, if it is found nece&s;&s;ary to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of their power, or to the exclu&s;ion of knowledge. He is here preaching in a wilderne&s;s. They do not under&s;tand him, in a country where they are yet doubting and debating whether exclu&s;ive companies be not the be&s;t mode of trading to their colonies. The people, willingly deceived by their a&s;&s;uming and inefficient government, vainly place their hopes in the operation of its edicts, in&s;tead of helping them&s;elves. You may from thence conceive how far they are behind, and have yet to go.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t differ from Dr. R&mdash;, and think that the low &s;tate of literature, ta&s;te, and knowledge here, appears from their authors being &s;o indi&s;criminately admired
<PB N="83" REF="89">
among them, and by their pa&s;&s;ing without critici&s;m, who&s;e la&s;h they &s;o often de&s;erve. Though peru&s;ed by few, be&s;ides the mere readers of this nation, one would expect that &s;ome country apo|thecary or trade&s;man might &s;tep forth, and tell the&s;e gentlemen, and the world, where they are wrong. It is but too plain, that a want of u&s;eful knowledge, and a certain indifference and negli|gence in the mo&s;t important &s;ubjects, are now but too univer&s;ally prevalent throughout this once celebrated country.</P>
<P>An inquiry was lately made, in two con&s;iderable towns in this province, for any one who could gauge &s;ome ca&s;ks which were to be received in a contract for the king; but no &s;uch per&s;on could be found. Indeed, &s;cientific merit of any kind could not now be ea&s;ily produced or expected here, nor be of much u&s;e to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. It would lead to nothing&mdash;but to the In|qui&s;ition.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="90">The very few wants and conveniencies, the mi&s;erable appearance of the common people in this country, are very &s;triking to one lately arrived from England. Their want of ta&s;te, and of variety of colour, even in their Sunday's dre&s;&s;es, which are mo&s;tly con|fined to brown and black, or to the natural colour of the wool, and the great numbers who are always in rags, render a crowd of the&s;e people at a fair or a holiday, a melan|choly, in&s;tead of a cheerful &s;ight, as with us. But I find no country people any where &s;o well clothed as tho&s;e in England; nor the u&s;eful arts, I think, anywhere &s;o far advanced. This is not &s;ufficiently known to other nations. A tour to our i&s;land might have been of &s;ervice to &s;everal modern writers of the continent. On &s;ome &s;ubjects I always wi&s;h to know i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the author has been in England, before I read his book.

<HEAD><HI>LETTER IX.</HI> Talents. Conver&s;ation. Trades. Improve|ments. Princes.</HEAD>
<P>ALMOST every country excels in &s;ome art, &s;ome talent or abilities, above others. I think the Spaniards can dance, &s;ing, &s;have, and make chocolate, with any people in Europe; but I fear there are but few other of the u&s;eful or ornamental arts which they now po&s;&s;e&s;s to any degree of perfection. We mu&s;t except &s;peaking, which I had almo&s;t forgotten, and in which they certainly excel, by means of their fine language, which &s;eems naturally to flow in a manner that invites the &s;peaker to a kind of eloquence and urbanity.</P>
<P>We may partly, though not entirely, account for their conver&s;ation being &s;o &s;uperior to their writing. The dread of the Inqui&s;ition prevents men of letters
<PB N="86" REF="92">
from tru&s;ting their ideas to paper; it ter|rifies us all, hangs in our minds, and retards our pen as we write. I feel half afraid of it even here in my own room as I &s;it writing to you, and with &s;ome little dread and reluctance venture to &s;et down the name.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s of gilding, and that of printing, &s;eem yet pretty well pre&s;erved and executed in Spain; and one meets with an ingenious workman here and there; but few other trades are &s;upported and practi&s;ed as they &s;hould be. Their <HI>fomento,</HI> as they call them, or regulations, &s;ocieties, and premiums, for encouraging arts and indu&s;try, can never probably produce much good, though they have expended as much in that way as any nation. Perhaps they had better do nothing, as the &s;ure&s;t way of doing no harm. Indeed, mo&s;t govern|ments, in their officious encouragement of &s;uch things, are often either like the fly on the wheel; or retard more than they a&s;&s;i&s;t. They cannot always make men improve when and how they plea&s;e. We mu&s;t be left to our&s;elves in the objects, in the
<PB N="87" REF="93">
choice, and mea&s;ure of our exertions. Let us have but freedom and &s;ecurity enough, and we &s;hall endeavour to better and improve our condition, and &s;hall find out the way to do it more advantageou&s;ly than can be pointed out to us by any &s;u|perior power whatever.</P>
<P>Though it be difficult to change the cha|racter, or even to quicken the progre&s;s of &s;uch a people, yet a reflecting mind cannot help &s;peculating &s;ometimes, and thinking of the be&s;t way of going about it. Let us &s;uppo&s;e then a young prince, heir to the crown, to travel, to fall into good hands, and to make all the progre&s;s in u&s;e|ful &s;cience, in the knowledge of men and things, that you and I can conceive: and then we may likewi&s;e &s;uppo&s;e him to be equal to the chu&s;ing and preparing a &s;et of proper and enlightened men for his future mini&s;ters, &s;ecretaries, profe&s;&s;ors, bi&s;hops, &amp;c. and determined to make u&s;e of all the virtue and knowledge in his do|minions, of whatever cla&s;s or party, and to bring in more from abroad.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="94">However parties may traduce each other, I cannot conceive any cla&s;s of men in this age, to be totally u&s;ele&s;s or very dan|gerous. I believe all may be employed &s;o as to produce the good of the whole, when they are properly placed. Even the timid or cruel bigot might be turned to &s;omething u&s;eful; though we might not chu&s;e, for example, to employ him in a war again&s;t the Pope.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I can conceive &s;uch a prince at length &s;ettled on the throne, and under|taking to reform his kingdom by degrees: to begin by aboli&s;hing the Inqui&s;ition at once, and then the friars gradually, one order at a time, or leaving for a while &s;ome of the mo&s;t u&s;eful. Their rents might be advantageou&s;ly applied to public u&s;es, as to relieving the people from &s;ome of the mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive taxes in their re|&s;pective provinces, in order to intere&s;t them in the cau&s;e, and get them on his &s;ide. He might have influence enough to oblige the Pope to acquie&s;ce, and di&s;pen&s;e with the mona&s;tic vows, or might pen|&s;ion
<PB N="89" REF="95">
them for life, and di&s;po&s;e of them as has been done with the Je&s;uits.</P>
<P>He might then begin to admit of re|ligious toleration, fir&s;t in the &s;ea-ports, and then extend it gradually to the mo&s;t inland and improvable provinces, and to the colonies. Tho&s;e would thence gra|dually become populous and indu&s;trious, and many advantages would &s;oon appear, and gain the public opinion. Perhaps he might, in time, extend it to be a natural and complete toleration; by &s;topping gra|gually the funds that &s;upport the clergy, as they die off, leaving the people to pay and chu&s;e their own teachers, all ideas of a &s;tate religion, or of intolerance, would &s;oon be bani&s;hed; or &s;ome &s;eeds of this kind might be &s;own for the benefit of po&s;terity. Nor need it at all be feared, that real religion would &s;uffer by &s;uch a change: there has been already, in North America, experience enough to be convinced of the contrary. A ju&s;t and equal government wants not the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a &s;uper&s;titious religion: it is only tyranny and inju&s;tice
<PB N="90" REF="96">
that require &s;uch help, in order to terrify and &s;ubdue the people. It is evident that religion is nece&s;&s;ary to man, and he will probably be mo&s;t attached to that of his own choice.</P>
<P>We may then &s;uppo&s;e our prince almo&s;t wi&s;e and liberal enough to &s;ee the de&s;truc|tive policy of maintaining di&s;tant colonies, and that he may be willing to &s;ettle them into &s;eparate kingdoms, having previou&s;ly prepared them for it, and taught them by partial and gradual experiment, how to govern them&s;elves. This would &s;oon give them activity, indu&s;try, and &s;elf-impor|tance; and each kingdom would then have as much of the other's commerce as would be nece&s;&s;ary, and no more.</P>
<P>Sufficient freedom and &s;ecurity would render even Spaniards indu&s;trious. For I mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e my prince capable of re&s;tor|ing them their con&s;titution, and probably with improvements; giving them their ancient Cortes, but with a more equal and
<PB N="91" REF="97">
adequate repre&s;entation. He would not then be jealous or afraid of the pro&s;perity of his own people; and would encourage the nobility to live on their e&s;tates, or to travel, and learn from other nations. He would likewi&s;e endeavour to reform the &s;chools, and improve the education of his people, not &s;uffering this ta&s;k to be confined to the clergy, but entru&s;ting it to &s;ome cho&s;en men, who would teach more u&s;eful knowledge, with more beneficial habits and virtues. I will not detain you by enumerat|ing what he might do.</P>
<P>Such a prince would be the father of his country, and &s;uch a dreaming &s;peculator as you may have been &s;uppo&s;ing me to be, would think he could hardly fail of &s;ucceed|ing, at lea&s;t in part. But when we come to a&s;k how and where &s;uch a prince, and &s;uch mini&s;ters, could be found, or formed, in &s;uch a country, the vi&s;ion vani&s;hes, and we mu&s;t be content to leave them as they are, perhaps for ages yet to come.

<HEAD><HI>LETTER X.</HI> Government and Character of the French and Spaniards.</HEAD>
<P>I THINK mo&s;t nations, except this, &s;eem to have the &s;pecies of government nearly &s;uited to their character. How much the one is produced by the other, would be difficult to determine. Perhaps much of the character is derived from the government, and reciprocally they go on with a kind of mutual influence, gradually wearing into a fitne&s;s for each other.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of France and tho&s;e of Spain, &s;o oppo&s;ite in di&s;po&s;ition, probably require different kinds of government, but they are now nearly of the &s;ame kind; and hence we may conclude one of them to be wrong, which is probably that of Spain. The French incon&s;tancy, heat, impetuo&s;ity, and the Spani&s;h &s;teady patience, natural
<PB N="94" REF="100">
pride and indolence, mu&s;t require different treatment. Different &s;oils and &s;ituations mu&s;t have different culture to make them productive. The&s;e two nations can never find much to borrow from, or to like in, each other. They &s;eem originally intended to be enemies; and if left to them&s;elves, the leading principles of their governments would probably be as oppo&s;ite as their ta&s;te and character.</P>
<P>The character of the French,&mdash;their pe|culiar humours, fire, and caprice, perhaps render them unfit to be tru&s;ted with that de|gree of liberty, which to other nations &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary. Unable to judge of oppre&s;&s;ion or inju&s;tice but from fancy or fa&s;hion, they mu&s;t, perhaps, be guided and re&s;trained by a de&s;|potic hand. And &s;o long as that can be con|&s;idered as the hand of a father, and de&s;po|ti&s;m can conceal its character under the cloak of amiable and liberal manners and &s;entiments; while an open and amicable intercour&s;e is kept up between &s;overeign and people by proper <HI>media,</HI> it may long go on &s;moothly, and even &s;ometimes with
<PB N="95" REF="101">
a degree of pro&s;perity far beyond what could have been expected; but we have now probably &s;een its limits, or <HI>maxi|mum</HI> of &s;ucce&s;s, and may prophe&s;y that it cannot go much farther. Though the prince acknowledge him&s;elf tied by no con&s;titutional bonds, the&s;e are partly, though precariou&s;ly, &s;upplied by his attention to the national prejudices and public opinion, to the advices and remon&s;trances of his own tribunals, which, though originally in&s;ti|tuted to enlarge his authority, have gra|dually a&s;&s;umed a kind of right to control his edicts, and almo&s;t to repre&s;ent the na|tion, or at lea&s;t to deceive it.</P>
<P>But the Spani&s;h character &s;eems to re|quire and de&s;erve a government of free|dom and &s;ecurity, as a nece&s;&s;ary incitement to the good and proper remedy for its bad qualities. It would be requi&s;ite for the exerci&s;e of their natural good &s;en&s;e, of their rational and meditative turn of mind, and their other powerful and di&s;tingui&s;hing qualities, as pride, honour, firmne&s;s, mag|nanimity, which we know they po&s;&s;e&s;s,
<PB N="96" REF="102">
when excited by &s;ufficient motives. It would likewi&s;e &s;erve as a cure to their in|dolence, &mdash;to their fal&s;e notions of honour and religion. But all the modern changes in their government have had a contrary cour&s;e and tendency.</P>
<P>By peru&s;ing their hi&s;tory, you will trace &s;ome of the cau&s;es and the progre&s;s of their grandeur and of their decline. The union of &s;everal kingdoms under one wi&s;e head (Ferdinand) &s;uddenly formed a great power, invigorated by the ferment of liberty, and the natural operations of their then free, though complicated and imperfect &s;y&s;tems of government. Their internal and Moori&s;h wars,&mdash;their di&s;co|very of the new world,&mdash;their acce&s;&s;ion to Au&s;tria, produced great objects of national exertion. Di&s;tant wars, conque&s;t, defence, di&s;covery, commerce, all con&s;pired to call forth the mo&s;t powerful public and indivi|dual efforts, and to make them really great. But national greatne&s;s knows no bounds. It generally at la&s;t over&s;hoots them all, and exhau&s;ts it&s;elf. Then the inva&s;ion of
<PB N="97" REF="103">
their rights by Charles V. and the final de&s;truction of their con&s;titution by his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors, became more than &s;ufficient to overbalance and bear down all the advan|tages of their acqui&s;itions: and the bane|ful effects of over &s;trained efforts, of mi&s;|taken policy, and of de&s;poti&s;m, &s;oon be|gan to appear. The nation, as it became, by the lo&s;s of its liberties, le&s;s able to bear additional weights, was, as u&s;ually happens more heavily loaded, and &s;oon ex|hau&s;ted, by the ambitious, and then uncon|trollable pur&s;uits of its princes. Its opera|tions abroad became more languid, while at home the national character degenerated; till, by the help of other unfavourable in|cidents, it &s;unk at la&s;t into a dependence on that very power with whom it for|merly contended with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>As the nation had neither &s;pirit, force, nor wi&s;dom enough left, to chu&s;e a king and government of its own on the death of Charles II. the Spaniards are obliged to &s;ubmit to be governed by the arbitrary &s;y&s;tems of Bourbon politics, in which
<PB N="98" REF="104">
the intere&s;t of the country does not form even a part. They have already paid &s;everely for that connection, were it only by the wars into which it has led them, in which they had no real intere&s;t, and for which they were totally unfit and unequal, after being &s;o irrecoverably debilitated. How diffe|rent their &s;ituation from that of former periods, when they could make all their foreign connections act &s;ub&s;ervient to their own views; and when the council of Vienna was well known to be only the mini&s;ter of that of Madrid.</P>
<P>Whatever apparent or pretended im|provements have been introduced by the Bourbon government, have certainly not been in favour of freedom, nor of the an|cient con&s;titution; nor has the increa&s;e of forms, councils, or &s;ubdivi&s;ions, tended to facilitate, but rather to embarra&s;s and retard the public bu&s;ine&s;s, and to compo&s;e a com|plex &s;y&s;tem of tyranny, which removes almo&s;t every object that could excite great talents or indu&s;try, or that could rai&s;e &s;uch minds to great or noble actions.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="105">From the&s;e facts, and their numerous con&s;equences, &mdash; the negligence and cor|ruption of people in public office, the im|po&s;&s;ibility of redre&s;s for any per&s;on they may chu&s;e to oppre&s;s; and the want of legal or con&s;titutional intercour&s;e between the &s;overeign and the people;&mdash;we cannot expect to find in this nation any great or continued efforts of public &s;pirit to &s;tem the torrent of national corruption. Their government naturally produces a de&s;pon|dency in all, and more e&s;pecially in the lower and mo&s;t important cla&s;&s;es of people. In &s;hort, their new government &s;eems only intent on converting them entirely into Frenchmen, which they never will be, and on &s;ubduing the remaining magnanimity, and other virtues left in their character; in which it may &s;ucceed by time, in&s;idious policy, and artificial &s;y&s;tems of oppre&s;&s;ion. Seeing them now become &s;laves to &s;uper|&s;tition and arbitrary power; their former character and &s;pirit enervated and &s;ub|dued; the poverty and de&s;olation of the country; and comparing former periods with the pre&s;ent, the effects of

<P>Your ideas of the Spani&s;h character are not, I believe, &s;o wrong as tho&s;e of many others. I cannot pretend to e&s;timate for you how much they have lo&s;t of their ancient character, nor decide between the real merits of their old cavalier, and their modern fine gentleman; we have natural prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in favour of the old, and mu&s;t fear that they have lo&s;t, by the decline of chivalry, &s;ome of tho&s;e high notions of honour, without obtaining always the advantages of our modern refinements of &s;entiment, which, when &s;ea&s;oned with good &s;en&s;e, come in &s;ometimes tolerably well to &s;upply the place of that old enthu&s;ia&s;m of honour. They mu&s;t excu&s;e us, if we doubt their having gained by this change; and if we likewi&s;e
<PB N="101" REF="107">
doubt their claim to a &s;uperiority in man|ners, or in plea&s;ure, while they affect to laugh at the rigid notions of their an|ce&s;tors, and con&s;ider plea&s;ure as con&s;i&s;t|ing in unre&s;trained and unrefined indul|gence.</P>
<P>Their military and political talents were, for a long time, confe&s;&s;edly the fir&s;t in the world, and were not, perhaps, outdone by the Romans them&s;elves in their be&s;t times. And though they are now fallen even lower than the world imagines, yet I would not advi&s;e any nation to treat them with much real contempt, nor think that they can therefore be ea&s;ily defeated or ea&s;ily managed. Their councils &s;till retain much of their former ob&s;tinacy, and of that im|penetrable my&s;tery for which they were al|ways remarkable; and their troops, though now few, and not well formed, yet by &s;ome good officers, and a few campaigns, might perhaps be rendered again invincible.</P>

<P>THE complaint is, I believe, rather general, that Spain is little known: but this mu&s;t proceed more from want of readers than of writers; for, upon en|quiry, you will find that much has been written on the &s;ubject. It may be true, that &s;uch writers are le&s;s read or known than tho&s;e of other countries; that writings are in&s;ufficient to furni&s;h the ideas generally expected from them; and that this penin|&s;ula, lying out of the common tracts of communication, is therefore le&s;s vi&s;ited: but tho&s;e few vi&s;itors, I think, generally write; and though the country does not perhaps furni&s;h more matter than &s;ome
<PB N="106" REF="112">
others, if many more were to travel thither, each might &s;till find &s;omething new to ob|&s;erve.</P>
<P>Nations cannot be too much ac|quainted or connected with each other: the good effects are obvious from hi&s;tory and experience, and &s;eem to be nearly in proportion to the clo&s;ene&s;s and intimacy of tho&s;e connections. You &s;ee how quickly our i&s;land has improved &s;ince the union. Nations freely opening their ports and commerce, their laws and im|provements, to each other, will be the mo&s;t indubitable proofs of the real im|provement of the world.</P>
<P>This corner of the penin&s;ula lies even more out of the common tract than the re&s;t of it, and is therefore &s;till le&s;s known: but it is the province of the mo&s;t im|portance to Spain, except perhaps Cata|lonia. It contains about 1000 or 1200 &s;quare leagues, and they &s;ay, about one million and a half of inhabitants; but &s;up|po&s;e it only one million, it is no bad po|pulation,
<PB N="107" REF="113">
and far beyond the re&s;t of Spain. As &s;oldiers, I believe they are &s;uperior to mo&s;t of the other Spaniards at pre&s;ent, when their extreme frugality is not carried too far towards <HI>&s;tarvation;</HI> for even &s;ome of their young people &s;eem half &s;tarved; &s;o much that I &s;hould doubt if even care and good living, or any thing, could make good and &s;pirited &s;oldiers of them. Contrary to the re&s;t of Spain, mo&s;t of their little farms and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions are too &s;mall, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors too poor to im|prove them: however, the mode of tenure, <HI>los foros,</HI> like our copyholds, is preferable, and it would be much better for Spain were it general throughout, e&s;pecially if they could exclude the inconvenience of &s;ubtenants, too frequent here, as in Scot|land and Ireland.</P>
<P>The rea&s;ons gradually appear, why the produce of this province does not increa&s;e with the increa&s;e of money and demand. Above one-third of the lands belong to the church, and perhaps one-fifth of the pro|duce of the re&s;t goes the &s;ame way in
<PB N="108" REF="114">
tithes and devotional donations. Two-thirds of the lands are entailed upon a few <HI>mayora&s;gos,</HI> or belong to tho&s;e who are too poor to cultivate with advantage: now it is obvious, that few of the&s;e three cla&s;&s;es will improve their lands, or be&s;tow any expence upon them above what is ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary; their <HI>aforados</HI> certainly cannot, and &s;till le&s;s their &s;ubtenants; a very few only among the &s;maller <HI>mayora&s;gos,</HI> who are obliged, from poverty, to live at home, and &s;ome creoles when they can find any land to buy, which is very &s;eldom, can ever be expected to improve their e&s;tates: money, in other hands, can be of little &s;ervice to the country, as little or no land can come to market; and people will not ri&s;k their capitals in any &s;chemes of manu|facture or great improvement under &s;uch a government.</P>
<P>As to the taxes here, though this pro|vince has compounded with government for &s;ome of the mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive, the re|mainder are found to be very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing; which is al&s;o aggravated by the rigorous
<PB N="109" REF="115">
and often arbitrary manner of levying all duties in this country, and by the habitual corruption and di&s;hone&s;ty of tho&s;e em|ployed not only in that department, but indeed in almo&s;t every public employ|ment: perhaps it mu&s;t be &s;o, where there is no &s;y&s;tem of control from the repre&s;entatives of the people. But they are, neverthele&s;s, quite embarra&s;&s;ed in this province with numberle&s;s laws and re|gulations, and hence with eternal law-&s;uits. We may here &s;ee how conceited and offici|ous legi&s;lators, even with good intentions, may <HI>regulate</HI> away all the powers and de|&s;ires of men to improve: the people will only do it in their own way; when forced into any other, they will probably &s;oon neglect it. Such &s;eems to have been the progre&s;&s;ive decay of indu&s;try in the&s;e countries.</P>
<P>The poor ragged <HI>gallegos</HI> are, however, rather indu&s;trious in their ignorant and coar&s;e way. They are frugal to a degree of mi&s;ery, and e&s;pecially the women: who
<PB N="110" REF="116">
likewi&s;e perform the harde&s;t labour in the fields, as frequently as the men, or more &s;o. They drive the cart, they plow, and carry the manure where it is to be had, often in their arms, &s;preading it with their hands in&s;tead of a dung-fork.</P>
<P>The civilization of almo&s;t every country might be mea&s;ured by the re&s;pect &s;hown and employment allotted the female part of &s;ociety: in &s;avage life, the women are held in the mo&s;t laborious and abject &s;tate of bondage; and in the highe&s;t &s;tate of civilization, they &s;eem to govern the world: in the one, they labour and carry burdens for their tyrants the men; and in the other, they &s;it &s;till and direct them as their humble &s;laves; and in that &s;ituation, are very apt, like all human beings, to indulge in pernicious delicacy and idlene&s;s, which lead, by degrees, to noxious vices and de|pravity: or rather, we men indulge them, and do all we can to &s;poil their natural, active, and u&s;eful di&s;po&s;itions, and are the real authors of all that debility and
<PB N="111" REF="117">
corruption of manners for which they are &s;o often blamed. But even in the mo&s;t di&s;&s;olute &s;tate of &s;ociety, women do not often break loo&s;e entirely, nor go &s;o far in vice as the men, but often &s;erve as &s;ome re&s;traint to keep them within bounds. A wi&s;e govern|ment would endeavour at &s;ome ju&s;t medium between tho&s;e extremes: that medium will be found to con&s;i&s;t, I believe, in the mo&s;t perfect equality that is practicable between the &s;exes, in the enjoyment of per&s;onal rights, eminence, education; and the ap|proaches to that equality may &s;erve as indi|cations of perfection in &s;ociety and govern|ment.</P>

<P>TRIFLES often become of con&s;e|quence, according to circum&s;tances, and may &s;erve, as well as more im|portant things, to &s;hew the character and &s;tate of a nation. The want of chimnies in this country, which is moun|tainous, and &s;ometimes very cold, is not a little di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to us in our family way of living; and thence you may gue&s;s how little they are advanced in the conveniencies or luxuries of life. We have been obliged to build a kind of a chimney in a corner, but it co&s;t us great trouble to get the work-men to comprehend and execute the work: many of the inhabitants come now on pur|po&s;e to &s;ee it. In &s;ome of their towns, it is but of late that the boys and populace have
<PB N="113" REF="119">
left off breaking the gla&s;s windows when|ever any body ventured to u&s;e them: in other places, they have de&s;troyed all the trees and &s;tatues of the public walks. Hence we &s;ee how difficult it is to improve the &s;avage man, or to entice him even into common decency and cleanline&s;s. It has co&s;t a great deal of trouble and oppo&s;ition from the people in Madrid, to admit the late improvements in the police and com|forts of their town, and from their gene|ral aver&s;ion to cleanline&s;s, to prevent their dirtying the &s;treets from wanton|ne&s;s and bad habits.</P>
<P>I believe that which contributes mo&s;t to put us out of humour at times with the&s;e mi&s;erable gallegos, is their pilfering &s;o frequently every thing from our hou&s;e and garden; and we can hardly find any body here who has our &s;en&s;e of the meanne&s;s and turpitude of this thievi&s;h di&s;po&s;ition. Their neighbours, the Portu|gue&s;e, are &s;till greater thieves if po&s;&s;ible. One would think the lower cla&s;&s;es in the&s;e countries all accomplices, or that tacitly ap|proving
<PB N="114" REF="120">
of theft, they were determined to keep one another in countenance. It is &s;o common, that nobody &s;eems very much a&s;hamed of it;&mdash;or of a gaol, which is &s;carcely con&s;idered a puni&s;hment. Though their pri&s;ons are &s;hocking nau&s;eous dun|geons, their own hou&s;es and way of life are &s;o little better, that they &s;eem to live in them with as little &s;hame and regret as at home. Such are the &s;ubjects of arbitrary governments. The u&s;ual and mo&s;t approved remedy here for recovering &s;tolen goods is, by applying to the father Confe&s;&s;or, who often &s;ucceeds, and brings them to you, on condition of no que&s;tions being a&s;ked, and no farther di&s;covery being made.</P>
<P>It is a bad wind that blows no good. We mu&s;t take the good with the bad in all human in&s;titutions, be thankful, and not condemn the whole becau&s;e a part is imperfect. It &s;eems fortunate that&punc; even in the wor&s;t regulated &s;ocieties, there are &s;till &s;ome who have an influence on the minds of the wor&s;t of the people.

when government permitted &s;o much po|litical influence to an exclu&s;ive religion, they gave them&s;elves a ma&s;ter with whom they could never afterwards contend. The &s;acred &s;eal of confe&s;&s;ion was admirably contrived to complete the &s;y&s;tem of church power and influence. I am often, on re|flection, a&s;toni&s;hed at the &s;ucce&s;s of the Prote&s;tant reformation, again&s;t &s;uch an art|ful and well e&s;tabli&s;hed power.

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XIII.</HI> Reflections on Home, on Finance, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IN almo&s;t any country, we may be as happy as our nature admits, if we are once determined to make the be&s;t of it: but in few countries it is po&s;&s;ible to form this determination, and in fewer &s;till can we keep it. A longing de&s;ire after <HI>home</HI> haunts us every where. The pur&s;uit of &s;ome decided plan may pro|duce exertions that employ and fill up the mind, as well in one place as ano|ther. But tho&s;e who, as you &s;ay, pretend to make no difference between places, and to be always equally happy in all, mu&s;t either want feeling, ta&s;te, or veracity; or they mu&s;t have acquired a degree of &s;toical apathy which I do not under&s;tand. With me, I mu&s;t confe&s;s a great partiality and affection for every thing belonging to our
<PB N="118" REF="124">
native land &s;eems to increa&s;e with time and di&s;tance, to a degree which you cannot at home feel or conceive. The &s;ight of every Engli&s;h face is a treat to me.</P>
<P>We are not always aware of the motives that influence or produce our actions and opinions. In &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition of mind, I am perhaps too often in the humour to cur&s;e this dirty country, and to doubt whether any thing in it be worth writing to you about. I then recall my thoughts from home, look round, and find that the knowledge of error and &s;uper&s;ti|tion, the effects of tyranny, civil and re|ligious, are of con&s;equence, though gene|rally con&s;idered as common-place, and charitably overlooked by mo&s;t travellers. You know my opinion, that more impor|tant le&s;&s;ons are frequently to be drawn from the errors than from the knowledge of others.</P>
<P>So far from de&s;pi&s;ing the natural ver&s;atility of mind given to man, he ought rather to re|joice, that he is capable of &s;uch ea&s;y tran&s;itions
<PB N="119" REF="125">
from painful anxiety and vexation, to ea&s;e and tranquillity; that he can &s;o &s;oon be re|conciled to his &s;ituation, and forget his misfortunes; and that the wretch of to|day, may be happy to-morrow, without any change of outward circum&s;tances. So &s;oon as we have recovered that ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ing, good humour, we &s;ee with different eyes; objects change their appearance and hue. I can then very well agree with your &s;peculative friend, and admit that there mu&s;t be &s;ome|thing worth ob&s;erving every where, and that even the poor na&s;ty people who now &s;urround us, may excite the attention of a philo&s;opher. I am, however, &s;o far re|covered from the vexation of our late rob|beries, and &s;ome other ill u&s;age, that I find my&s;elf again beginning to be amu&s;ed with trifles. We are ju&s;t going to St. Jago, the capital of the province and of their &s;uper&s;tition, where we may contemplate the power of the church, the di&s;&s;olute manners of her &s;ons, or hear &s;ome of her good mu&s;ic.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="126">But you wi&s;hed for information con|cerning Spani&s;h finance. You will find accounts of it already publi&s;hed, &s;ufficiently correct for your purpo&s;e; &s;o that I &s;hall only give you &s;ome general ideas and re|flections.</P>
<P>Their whole &s;y&s;tem then of taxation, or finance, is, in my opinion, a collection of abu&s;es founded on ignorance and op|pre&s;&s;ion; &s;o much &s;o, that all attempts to improve the country will be vain, till they have changed the whole plan and principles of their finance, as well as of their policy and religion. But their igno|rance of the true principles of national re|venue and pro&s;perity leads me to think, that if they could be brought to change, it would be for the wor&s;e. They have talked of that French chimera, the <HI>droit unique,</HI> which they might be romantic enough to adopt, find them&s;elves di&s;appointed, then return to their old methods of taxation, and never di&s;cover all the while that both were fallacious.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="127">Their taxes, like many other of their cu&s;toms and regulations, are either of Moori&s;h origin, derived from the mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive feudal times, or built upon the wor&s;t of modern principles. You will find, that the chief part of the revenue ari&s;es, 1&s;t, From the <HI>milliones,</HI> which is a tax on &s;everal &s;orts of provi&s;ions, and the nece&s;&s;aries of life: 2dly, From the <HI>duana</HI> or cu&s;toms: 3dly, The <HI>&s;iete ren|tillas:</HI> 4thly, From the &s;alt: 5thly, From the bullion ari&s;ing from the mines, when imported, and when exported; and 6thly, From the tobacco, the collection of which tax alone is &s;aid to employ above 70,000 people. But the mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive, though far from the mo&s;t productive, of all their taxes is, the <HI>Alcavala:</HI> which is an im|po&s;t of from ten to fourteen <HI>per cent.</HI> on every &s;ale of almo&s;t every thing; &s;o that five or &s;ix &s;ales double the price. By this they have bani&s;hed trade and manufactures from their country. They lo&s;t the United Provinces by endeavouring to force this tax on them, after the mea&s;ure of oppre&s;&s;ion was full. They now know it to be quite
<PB N="122" REF="128">
&s;ufficient of it&s;elf to ruin the country, and keep down the commerce and indu&s;try of any nation; we may therefore &s;uppo&s;e it is continued for that purpo&s;e. The whole ordinary revenue is &s;uppo&s;ed to amount to about four millions &s;terling, and I believe cannot be much increa&s;ed; a cir|cum&s;tance replete with many important and mi&s;chievous con&s;equences.</P>
<P>What you formerly ob&s;erved is <HI>&agrave;-propos</HI> to our &s;ubject, and &s;hould not be lo&s;t, viz. That the natural progre&s;&s;ion of indu&s;try has not only, almo&s;t every where, been ob|&s;tructed by the carele&s;s rapacity of govern|ments, but often by the very regulations officiou&s;ly meant to promote it; one &s;pe|cies of indu&s;try has been encouraged to the ruin of others more u&s;eful; every &s;tep they took tended to curtail natural liberty without any equivalent advantage. Such have been mo&s;t of the laws e&s;tabli&s;hing corporations and monopolies, and regu|lating apprentice&s;hips; taxes on work, workmen, &s;ales, and returns, on exports
<PB N="123" REF="129">
and imports, &amp;c. by which all the circula|tion has been led through a channel where it could not have the mo&s;t advantageous ef|fects, the revenue of the &s;tate. By their fooli&s;h and &s;elfi&s;h &s;y&s;tems of balance of trade, every nation has endeavoured to impoveri&s;h its neighbours, as if with a view to pre|vent their becoming happy and indu&s;trious, and thereby profitable cu&s;tomers: con|&s;idering money as real riches, though only a very equivocal &s;ign of them, they are cutting down the tree to get at the fruit.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the&s;e fal&s;e principles and preju|dices &s;till exi&s;t here in their <HI>full vigour;</HI> nay, many of them originated and &s;pread from hence, when this was a leading na|tion in Europe; and their gra&s;ping, &s;elfi&s;h plans of commerce and colonization have been but too much imitated by other na|tions.</P>
<P>After all, con&s;idering the expence attend|ing modern governments, and the pre&s;ent &s;tate of mo&s;t countries, the be&s;t remedy is but a bad one, viz. A little more
<PB N="124" REF="130">
&s;kill and artifice in laying and levying the taxes, which not only mu&s;t &s;till exi&s;t, but are thence increa&s;ed; and the free&s;t and riche&s;t governments are thus tempted to go as much too far as the poore&s;t de&s;pot. The two grand objects to be attended to, are fir&s;t to enrich the people, and then to lay the taxes equally: but, alas! how few men or mini&s;ters are capable of either!</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XIV.</HI> Andalu&s;ia. Cadiz. Trade to the Colonies. Laws of Ports.</HEAD>
<HEAD>To Mr. T.</HEAD>
<P>I MEAN now to give you a &s;hort ac|count of a long journey, from one extremity of Spain to the other; from Gibraltar, by way of Madrid, to Co|runna, which you may find interrupt|ed by occa&s;ional reflections, <HI>a l'ordinaire.</HI> Your favourite province of Andalu&s;ia may often prove the mo&s;t intere&s;ting part of a journey through Spain, both on ac|count of the peculiar humour, dialect, wit, and urbanity of its inhabitants, and (provided you have only Spani&s;h ideas of riches and plenty) on account of the com|parative affluence of the country. But to an Engli&s;hman, if we except the few rich
<PB N="126" REF="132">
plains on the Guadalquivir, and &s;ome other &s;maller rivers that run into it, the whole province has but a barren and naked ap|pearance. Leaving the u&s;ual tracts, we &s;ometimes cro&s;&s;ed wild and de&s;ert hills, inhabited by &s;hepherds who had nothing to offer us but <HI>ga&s;pacho,</HI> or bread and water &s;ea&s;oned with a little pepper and oil. Throughout the greate&s;t part of the province, I could have fancied my&s;elf travelling between the far &s;eparated Moori&s;h villages, con&s;i&s;ting of a few wretched huts, thinly &s;cattered among the mountains.</P>
<P>In the corn lands, the incredibly large tracts belonging to every <HI>cortijo,</HI> or cot|tage, are badly cultivated, as may ea&s;ily be imagined from their too great extent; and excepting in the two German colonies, the &s;ame appearance of rags and poverty is to be met with, that &s;trikes the traveller in the interior parts of Spain. The cultivation of oil &s;eems to be profitable, as the appear|ance
<PB N="127" REF="133">
of their grounds, works, and mills, &s;ufficiently indicate.</P>
<P><HI>Cadiz</HI> de&s;erves our fir&s;t notice, both on account of its opulence and important &s;ituation. You may pre&s;ently perceive here a more liberal way of thinking, a character even of luxury and vice, diffe|rent from the re&s;t of the nation. More cheerful manners, more confidence, credit, and &s;ociability among men, who are not, as in other parts, kept a&s;under by a me|lancholy and di&s;tru&s;tful poverty; &s;oured by pride and oppre&s;&s;ion, rendered diffident and indifferent about each other, and about almo&s;t every thing.</P>
<P>Wherever the people of different nations are well &s;ettled and mixed, I think the hu|man &s;pecies improves, and a race is pro|duced &s;uperior to either &s;ide of the original &s;tock. Nature &s;eems, by every means, to invite the people of different countries and climates to a&s;&s;ociate, to a&s;&s;i&s;t and improve each other; a di&s;po&s;ition which their fooli&s;h and malignant governments are always endeavouring to control. The
<PB N="128" REF="134">
per&s;onal improvements of the people here, e&s;pecially of the middling and better &s;ort, I think is obvious, and has been progre&s;&s;ive even within my memory.</P>
<P>This is now almo&s;t the only thriving place in Spain, and its trade is &s;aid to have increa&s;ed of late a million of dollars an|nually. But to me it is a matter of doubt, whether the riches of this town are advan|tageous to the nation. The trade to the colonies, which is entirely confined to this port, throws all the riches and luxury of the kingdom into one part, while the re&s;t is &s;tarved. The country is equally drained of its inhabitants, by their flocking to the new world, to which their idlene&s;s and poverty have taught them to turn their hopes and attention, in&s;tead of minding their bu&s;ine&s;s, and endeavouring to acquire that ea&s;e and comfort at home, which they in vain &s;eek in new Spain.</P>
<P>Some of the&s;e evils &s;eem to have engaged the attention of government; and as a remedy, the commerce of this port is in|tended
<PB N="129" REF="135">
to be divided between thirteen more: but I doubt the remedy will be in|effectual, or produce other evils. The <HI>wi&s;e ones</HI> &s;uppo&s;e, that by this divi&s;ion more money, and a greater portion of the freights and profits of their trade, will remain in the country: &s;o much the wor&s;e. The Spaniards attempt more bu&s;i|ne&s;s than they have capital or hands to manage well; the nation has hitherto fur|ni&s;hed little el&s;e to its own trade, than a place of rendezvous and depo&s;it for &s;tran|gers; yet, even from this, there remains more money in the country than does it good. The abundance of money in Spain has had the mo&s;t pernicious effects; as it has increa&s;ed, every thing el&s;e is become dear and &s;carce, indu&s;try has dimini&s;hed, and manufactures have di&s;appeared; &s;o that Monte&s;quieu's que&s;tions are now &s;ufficiently an&s;wered by experience, viz. <Q>Whether money, in too great abundance, will not <HI>always</HI> have the effects it has had in Spain?</Q> And, <Q>Whether the money trade with its colonies can ever be bene|ficial to that country?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="136">While this is the ca&s;e, extending a &s;y&s;tem in which the evils predominate, can hardly prove a remedy, but the contrary. Tho&s;e evils will be extended and increa&s;ed, and may &s;till overpower the advantages. Various abu&s;es and frauds will multiply with the occa&s;ions, with the increa&s;e of offices and of money, and with the drain of people.</P>
<P>I know of no &s;ufficient remedy for this, excepting religious toleration, and the en|couragement of &s;trangers; nor of any power that could repeople and re&s;tore their country, without a free and gradual ad|mi&s;&s;ion of foreigners; but then this would change their whole &s;y&s;tem of government, religion, and commerce, which is too much to be expected or attempted at once. Unfortunately for them, even their learned and wi&s;e men &s;till retain much of the vulgar jealou&s;y of admitting &s;trangers to &s;ettle and grow rich in their country, which is ju&s;t what they want mo&s;t.</P>
<P>The Spaniards, or their creoles, are by no means bad ma&s;ters; on the contrary,
<PB N="131" REF="137">
they are perhaps too indulgent, &s;o that their &s;laves and dome&s;tics become idle and indolent. The defect is not in the indivi|duals, but in the con&s;titution of their go|vernment, which is certainly not framed &s;o as to reform it&s;elf: that can only be done by a very great prince, by a Lycur|gus, a political hero, &s;uch as modern times do not produce; one who could relinqui&s;h half his own power, and who &s;hould know every thing.</P>
<P>It would almo&s;t require a miracle to open their eyes; and till that is done, there is but little hope of their opening their trade, or of their relinqui&s;hing their oppre&s;&s;ive &s;y&s;tems of duties and re|&s;traints, &s;o as to make it profitable enough for individuals to &s;upply each other acro&s;s the Atlantic with bulky goods and mate|rials, which is almo&s;t the only kind of commerce beneficial to a country, leaving all the various trades and manufactories to find their own places, and to balance them|&s;elves; and there is &s;till le&s;s hope of their opening their ports or colonies to foreigners, and of their entering into &s;ome competi|tion
<PB N="132" REF="138">
with other nations, though the only way to awaken indu&s;try; nor is there much hope of their &s;oon procuring or per|ceiving the right form of government, on which all this depends: we are &s;orry to find that even Campomanes &s;eems hardly &s;en&s;ible of the&s;e great leading principles of trade and national pro&s;perity; and as to the re&s;t of the nation, they are yet di&s;put|ing whether the barbarous and monopoliz|ing mode of exclu&s;ive companies be not the be&s;t way of trading to their own colonies. You may con&s;ider how far they are behind, and have yet to go.</P>
<P>But I am forgetting &s;ome other remarks I had to make on this place. The &s;ea will probably in time work its way through it, near the part where the new cathedral &s;tands, unle&s;s they con&s;truct better works for breaking the force of the waters, and &s;lope the banks properly, like tho&s;e of the Dutch for &s;uch purpo&s;es. And this cathe|dral will probably never be fini&s;hed, for another rea&s;on: the funds, or taxes, al|lotted for the work, are to continue till it
<PB N="133" REF="139">
&s;hall be completed, which the managers will therefore find means always to po&s;tpone <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The <HI>Duomo</HI> at Milan has been building the&s;e thou&s;and years, and is not yet fini&s;hed, perhaps for the &s;ame rea&s;ons.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The public is ea&s;ily cheated in &s;uch countries, and there is nobody to take its part here, except &s;ometimes the king: but even he has &s;eldom power &s;ufficient to do it effectually. Any impo&s;ition or abu&s;e, once e&s;tabli&s;hed on the firm ba&s;is of the intere&s;t of any powerful body of men, becomes thence almo&s;t immovable.</P>
<P>In every &s;ea-port perhaps in the world, there are &s;ome cu&s;tomary mitigations of the duties payable to the &s;tate. This, from bribery and connivance, is often gra|dually carried to extremes. Here, from the exorbitant and ill-judged impo&s;itions on merchandize, ordered by a government, con&s;titutionally ignorant and carele&s;s, all parties, by a kind of mutual con&s;ent, had agreed in making this allowance very con&s;iderable; in&s;omuch that not above half the impo&s;ed duties were probably levied, which was more for the advantage
<PB N="134" REF="140">
of the trade and of the crown, than if the whole had been taken. In no coun|try was there ever a better under&s;tanding between the executive officers of govern|ment and the men of bu&s;ine&s;s: indeed, without it, bu&s;ine&s;s could not perhaps be carried on at all. A new and rigid ad|mini&s;trator here, neverthele&s;s, in&s;i&s;ts on levying the whole of the duties as order|ed by the &s;tate. This is &s;aid to be im|po&s;&s;ible: however, he goes on in the rigid execution of his impracticable project; and we had the mortification to &s;ee &s;ome of his bonfires of fine Engli&s;h goods, great quantities of which he has lately cau&s;ed to be &s;eized and burnt according to their laws, for not having paid all tho&s;e impracticable impo&s;itions <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was, however, &s;oon found nece&s;&s;ary to remove this admini&s;trator.</NOTE>. In|deed, the duties &s;hould now be lower|ed, for &s;everal rea&s;ons common to all trade, and for &s;ome, peculiar to this coun|try. In their new ports, trade will other|wi&s;e meet with in&s;urmountable ob&s;tructions; and their &s;ubjects at home &s;hould, at lea&s;t,
<PB N="135" REF="141">
be put on a footing with their coloni&s;ts, who have been much favoured of late.</P>
<P>Men, when left to them&s;elves, will often fall into methods or expedients be&s;t &s;uited to their own &s;ituation: mitigating or evading bad laws by common con&s;ent, we frequently &s;ee practi&s;ed in many other parts of the world; which, on the whole, is cer|tainly better than a &s;trict ob&s;ervance of them, let the lawyers &s;ay what they will. When a law is commonly evaded, it is a &s;ign of its being a bad one; and &s;uch eva&s;ion becoming general, indicates a defective legi&s;lature more &s;trongly perhaps than a corrupted people. The general dread and abhorrence of the laws, and of all who are concerned in their execution, &s;o re|markable in this country, &s;hew that &s;ome|thing mu&s;t be ami&s;s. The people mu&s;t have &s;ome rea&s;on to fear inju&s;tice, from the nature or admini&s;tration of tho&s;e laws. We &s;hould not be &s;urpri&s;ed to find their minds and opinions depraved and erroneous, when either to follow or to oppo&s;e their natural guides and criterion, church and &s;tate, may equally lead them wrong.</P>

<HEAD>To Mr. A. J.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Cadix.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE general complaint, that the world degenerates, cannot always be ju&s;t. Yet in the progre&s;s of civilization we may conceive it to decline in morals, as it im|proves in arts and &s;ciences. Public and private virtue &s;eem now to be different, and do not nece&s;&s;arily exi&s;t together. A man, without lo&s;ing his good name, may commit acts to cheat government, the public, or the people, which were he to attempt on a friend would eternally di&s;grace him. The&s;e di&s;tinctions are very &s;triking here. We find many honourable and valuable private characters, but few of them in public employ; perhaps, when once in
<PB N="137" REF="143">
office, they are either obliged to go with the tide, or in &s;ome degree are nece&s;&s;arily corrupted by the very nature of power. I think we have &s;eldom found many of our friends, or even our&s;elves, remain quite the &s;ame after preferment as before. When public virtue is not in fa&s;hion, private integrity will hardly &s;tem the tide of corruption. Mo&s;t modern re|formers are a kind of conceited and partial little <HI>reformatori di &s;tato,</HI> who do more harm than good, like this Cadix ad|mini&s;trator, who&s;e &s;mall part, taken differ|ently from the re&s;t, &s;erves only more to di&s;concert the whole; they generally di&s;tre&s;s rather than reform, and inter|rupt more than they forward: an inter|ruption in one part of the public bu&s;ine&s;s may affect the whole.</P>
<P>It requires great wi&s;dom, as well as dexterity, to mend any of the wheels of &s;ociety. You cannot &s;top the machine, but mu&s;t watch and follow its motions, &s;o as to repair it by gentle means,&mdash;by general laws which may gradually and
<PB N="138" REF="144">
quietly execute them&s;elves. The young and precipitate are apt to fancy every im|provement practicable, even without watch|ing proper occa&s;ions, which occur but rarely. They fancy that truth, &s;cience, and &s;ound principles, can do every thing, and mu&s;t always prevail with mankind, without con&s;idering their character, and the condition of &s;ociety. This is rather a re&s;pectable error. Bold and precipitate re|formers are &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary and &s;uc|ce&s;sful on certain great and difficult oc|ca&s;ions.</P>
<P>The roots of mo&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed abu&s;es lie deep. Lopping off branches is doing no|thing, for others will &s;pring from the &s;ame &s;tem. Sometimes the whole &s;tem mu&s;t be rooted up, and another planted. But &s;uch violent innovations are not to be effected in times of tranquillity, or they would co&s;t more than the value, in different kinds of de&s;truction, in unde&s;erved &s;ufferings and derangements. Such a reform mu&s;t begin at the head, the &s;ource of all government.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="145">Countries &s;o loaded with political evils as this, invite the mind to political &s;peculation. Here we can &s;tudy bad government, and trace the whole chain of its pernicious ef|fects; no unprofitable &s;tudy, if properly pur&s;ued and applied. We may &s;ee how one fal&s;e principle produces innumerable evils not to be fore&s;een by human wi&s;dom; how one abu&s;e opens the door to many others. They hang as nece&s;&s;arily together as a &s;tring of lies; and an erroneous &s;y&s;tem once e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;eems immovable, as &s;o many are intere&s;ted in &s;upporting its abu&s;es; and hence even the wor&s;t &s;y&s;tems of govern|ment find many advocates.</P>
<P>Arts and &s;ociety cannot advance with pro|per celerity, till my&s;tery is bani&s;hed from every art and &s;ubject. Knowledge mu&s;t be &s;implified and laid open to public inve&s;tiga|tion, when fal&s;ity and non&s;en&s;e will be rea|dily di&s;tingui&s;hed from truth and &s;cience, and gradually abandoned as u&s;ele&s;s. We may then work in open day, and depend on mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance and forbearance, more than on any arts of deceiving each other.

We mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e men a little better than they are, in order to make them &s;o. Treat them with confidence, and they will endea|vour to de&s;erve it.</P>
<P>But I find I have been led on from one thing to another, to fill up my letter with &s;peculations, &s;o that it may now &s;eem tedi|ous to exemplify my doctrine, as I intend|ed, by the affairs and ca&s;es here that &s;ugge&s;ted the&s;e reflections, and to which they apply. Bad governments are full of u&s;eful le&s;&s;ons and in&s;truction; but by|&s;tanders principally &s;ee the game. The natives, happily perhaps for them, di&s;|cover little of it, and &s;eldom perceive the extent of their own depre&s;&s;ion, or the depth of their fall.</P>
<P>The art or &s;cience of legi&s;lation has made but little progre&s;s in tho&s;e coun|tries where the Roman laws have been adopted. That which is borrowed is not probably &s;o proper for us, or &s;o capable of improvement, as that which grows up in|digenous in the country. Better make new, or mend the old, than borrow what

does not fit us, unle&s;s we fir&s;t cut it, &s;o as to make it fit. There is hardly a legi&s;la|ture now in the world that de&s;erves the title, except our own; nor any other that is forced to attend to the intere&s;ts of all ranks and cla&s;&s;es of people.</P>
<P>The practice of the law is almo&s;t every where el&s;e defective or tyrannical, either under or over the mark. You know their &s;ecret and unfair modes of examination, and that here every judge &s;eems a &s;evere and inexorable tyrant, rather than a tender, humane, and benevo|lent friend to mercy, and to the pri&s;oners, which he appears to be in our courts of law; and yet I believe our courts di&s;patch more bu&s;ine&s;s, and do more rigid ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>I might, perhaps, tell you more of their laws, but mu&s;t confe&s;s my inability and want of time for that, and &s;everal other points that I could wi&s;h to attend to: each would require a particular &s;tudy and enquiry, and life is too &s;hort for them all. The chief laws are, 1. <HI>Los del
<PB N="142" REF="148">
fuero ju&s;go,</HI> compiled in the times of their Gothic kings, from old u&s;ages, and partly from the Theodo&s;ian code, orders of kings and councils, &amp;c. 2. <HI>La&s;de &s;iete partidas,</HI> collected by Frederick III. and publi&s;hed by his &s;on Alphon&s;o X. the a&s;tronomer. 3. <HI>Las leyes de Tozo,</HI> on criminal matters, mayora&s;gos, &amp;c. The popes have taken advantage of their confu&s;ion, as u&s;ual, to extend the papal juri&s;diction: though there appears, of late, &s;ome di&s;po&s;ition in govern|ment to re&s;train their power. I believe you will not find the&s;e, nor many other laws, to be much better for being old: nor do many of their more modern edicts and pragmatics &s;how any great progre&s;s of im|provement in legi&s;lation: but I know not enough of the &s;ubject to be particular, or decided.</P>
<P>Nations in general are too much bound by antiquity, and attached to old cu&s;toms, to improve rapidly. There mu&s;t, doubt|le&s;s, be fixed principles in every con&s;titution of government that de&s;erves the name: but the&s;e principles, once di&s;covered, &s;hould be progre&s;&s;ive, and not &s;tationary. Fixed
<PB N="143" REF="149">
laws &s;hould be di&s;tingui&s;hed from tempo|rary regulations, and gradually a&s;cend to|wards perfection, by &s;teps built upon dif|ferent and comparative experiments, ad|apted to the natural progre&s;s of mankind in every thing el&s;e. Yet when we venture on con&s;iderable changes, how few of them prove to be remedies! This ari&s;es chiefly from want of the above di&s;tinctions, and from &s;uch changes being introduced by force, and not originating from tho&s;e who are mo&s;t concerned in the event; being principally made by ignorant and in|dolent de&s;poti&s;m, which can never produce good laws, &s;uch as execute them&s;elves from being the real voice and intere&s;t of a large majority of all concerned. Human wi&s;dom is unequal to &s;udden and violent changes in laws and government, which are rarely attempted but in de&s;potic countries, where wi&s;dom is lea&s;t to be expected. The nece&s;&s;ity of every great reform mu&s;t be obvious, and long wi&s;hed for, before it be undertaken, and then it &s;hould only be effected by gradation, which makes every thing ea&s;y.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="150">Few have a right to con&s;ider this as common-place. What is known is far from being &s;ufficiently diffu&s;ed, and what remains to be di&s;covered, is con&s;ider|able and e&s;&s;ential. As you may be a &s;enator as well as a &s;oldier, the two fir&s;t characters in the &s;tate, and which, I think, &s;hould be oftener united, I wi&s;h you to be a civilian by times, and to take the mo&s;t enlarged views of mankind. Your &s;tudies, and your travels, &s;hould chiefly be directed to tho&s;e great objects, and you ought to learn to neglect, without de&s;pi&s;ing, the trifles that employ the majority of the rich, and even of the learned.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A PERSON of your &s;on's fortune and genius, I acknowledge, might and ought to attempt a general acquaintance with mo&s;t &s;ubjects, in preference to a more profound inve&s;tigation of a few only. But for that purpo&s;e he mu&s;t be left a good deal to his own cour&s;e, without much of the re&s;traint of &s;chool methods or di&s;cipline. His quickne&s;s and &s;en&s;ibility are good &s;ymp|toms, and may carry him farther than all the powers of mere application ever could go. You will &s;ee him much &s;ooner a&s;cend the tree of knowledge by direct ways of his own, than others by all their crooked artifi|cial paths and analytic ladders. Such minds re|quire only to be followed, and occa&s;ionally di|rected, and are not to be blindly led through the common modes of modern minutiae. Though we &s;hould always beware of paren+tal
<PB N="146" REF="152">
partiality, and of mi&s;taking the idlene&s;s and vivacity of youth for real genius and abilities; I think, in this ca&s;e, we are in no great danger of &s;uch a mi&s;take. I wi&s;h you might find &s;ome ea&s;ier and more direct methods of educating our youth, than tho&s;e u&s;ually practi&s;ed even in our highe&s;t &s;chools: &s;ome other method is much wanted to fix the objects, and guide the rapid progre&s;s of genius towards more active and important parts in life.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e monki&s;h in&s;titutions called uni|ver&s;ities, are growing too old and unfit for the pre&s;ent times, and &s;hould perhaps be laid a&s;ide for &s;omething new and more practical, on &s;ome &s;uch plan as that pro|po&s;ed by Milton, &amp;c. the very novelty of which might awaken &s;ome fre&s;h zeal and exertion. After all the attempts of the&s;e old fraternities to follow the improvements of the age, from the nature of their con|&s;titution I fear they will generally be too &s;low and too late; and we may doubt if on &s;uch old foundations there can be erected any in&s;titution, any mode or &s;y&s;tem of education, that will keep pace with the
<PB N="147" REF="153">
wants and progre&s;s of &s;ociety: though the endeavours which, we hear, are now employed for that purpo&s;e are certainly commendable, and may be attended with &s;ome temporary &s;ucce&s;s: &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s is, however, generally per&s;onal, and often dies with the reformers. You &s;ee the merits of Leyden &s;eemed to terminate with Boerhaave, and even tho&s;e of Edinburgh may gradually di&s;appear, if fortune &s;hould fail to &s;upply &s;ucce&s;&s;ors worthy of their pre&s;ent excellent teachers. I have often wondered there are not more attempts among us to erect &s;ome new &s;eminaries for general and u&s;eful knowledge, which might create emulation between the old and new.&mdash;Is there any hope from that at Warrington?</P>
<P>In this country we are forcibly &s;truck with the nece&s;&s;ary connection of the arts, on &s;eeing the lame progre&s;s of &s;ome on account of the want of others. I cannot therefore &s;o readily agree with you in &s;uppo&s;ing, that the u&s;eful arts and trades &s;hould, or can be succe&s;sfully cultivated in any nation, without the ornamental or fine arts; and am &s;orry that &s;uch opinions are yet &s;o
<PB N="148" REF="154">
common among us. Be a&s;&s;ured, the arts are all nece&s;&s;ary to each other, and all mu&s;t be carried on at the &s;ame time: though we are yet behind-hand in &s;ome of them, I think we are getting into the right way of &s;ucceed in all; and as we advance, we &s;hall gradually perceive the nece&s;&s;ary connection of the whole. That any of them are in|compatible with others, I con&s;ider as a mere &s;peculative prejudice. Though that eleva|tion of mind, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary in &s;ome of the liberal arts and walks of life, may not &s;eem to unite well with the mercenary &s;pirit of commerce; yet we &s;ee that a people mu&s;t fir&s;t be at their ea&s;e before they can attend to plea&s;ure, or its various &s;ources in nature, art, or fancy. Riches, gradually acquired in a &s;tate of freedom and exertion by trade, will naturally promote agriculture, letters, arts, and &s;cience, whenever government has wi&s;dom enough only to &s;uffer it. So|ciety then would cure it&s;elf of many follies, and much ignorance; the different ranks and cla&s;&s;es of men would be brought nearer together, in&s;tead of being &s;et a&s;under; the upper ranks would be cured of certain re|mains of feudal pride and non&s;en&s;e, and
<PB N="149" REF="155">
the lower, of a certain mean and deceitful &s;pirit of traffic and gain, which deba&s;es, as it engro&s;&s;es, the &s;oul; and all the arts would advance abrea&s;t. A &s;pirit of trade and indu&s;try &s;hould doubtle&s;s be encouraged, or rather left to encourage and produce it&s;elf: that &s;pirit is then capable of being gradually improved into enlarged and li|beral &s;entiment, and may in time come to be nearer allied to arts, arms, &s;cience, and good ta&s;te: our nation &s;hews &s;ufficiently the po&s;&s;ibility of that progre&s;s.</P>
<P>Though the Engli&s;h, in my opinion, are now before the re&s;t of the world in mo&s;t of the arts of importance, there are &s;till &s;ome branches left behind the re&s;t, and even the mo&s;t advanced mu&s;t feel the want of their companions. I am highly plea&s;ed to &s;ee your &s;on has &s;o thoroughly imbibed both the mu&s;ical and military &s;pirit, and is &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed and in the way to acquire tho&s;e accompli&s;hments; but not <HI>&agrave; l' Anglois,</HI> I hope, as yet; for the&s;e are ju&s;t the arts in which our nation is, I fear, the mo&s;t defi|cient, and without being &s;ufficiently &s;en&s;ible of the defect.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="156">Though we could perhaps produce a little army, &s;uperior, on the whole, to any other of equal numbers, as our men are excellent when they can be properly di&s;ciplined; yet I believe Germany is now the &s;uperior &s;chool for officers, as Italy is for mu&s;ic: and all the arts are &s;o naturally connected, e&s;pecially when well advanced, that even mu&s;ic is probably a nece&s;&s;ary link of the chain. Though our i&s;land may not, as formerly, for &s;ome time produce many generals and arti&s;ts of the very fir&s;t cla&s;s, we are in a fair way to be made &s;en&s;ible of what we want, which is, you know, the fir&s;t &s;tep towards amendment. But in tho&s;e walks we cannot thoroughly &s;ucceed, if confined to our own i&s;land, where the mind will be limited to certain tracts and nationalities, even in her greate&s;t progre&s;s; and to &s;et her free, we mu&s;t cro&s;s &s;eas and continents, and live and act a part in other countries.</P>
<P>Let us hope then that our active Engli&s;h &s;pirit, and pa&s;&s;ion for travel, will continue and increa&s;e among us, as well for the &s;up|port of the character and the arts we al|ready &s;o eminently po&s;&s;e&s;s, as for the im|provement
<PB N="151" REF="157">
of tho&s;e in which we are de|ficient; in that ca&s;e, our natural ardour and per&s;everance will gradually &s;urmount every difficulty, and we may become the fir&s;t people of the world in every human acquirement, as well as in political import|ance: but if we were to &s;hut our&s;elves up at home, and from pride, par&s;imony, or any other fal&s;e principle, relinqui&s;h, like the Spaniards, the intercour&s;e and con|nection with rival powers, we &s;hould &s;oon become a &s;ubordinate nation, and our genius and indu&s;try would die away as they have done here.</P>
<P>Nor can I &s;ee by all your arguments, drawn from &s;ituation or con&s;titution, why we may not become al&s;o a very military nation. The nation has, at different times, been very much &s;o, and was, I believe, al|ways the better for it. The taking the part that naturally belongs to us in the continental wars and alliances of the world, has commonly had the be&s;t ef|fects upon us; giving a military turn to the people, and to our gentlemen, which all together made advantageous additions to
<PB N="152" REF="158">
the Engli&s;h character, and produced advances in arts and in arms, with a certain urba|nity and civilization, which our govern|ment and &s;ituation, though both excellent, do not perhaps of them&s;elves be&s;tow. Men and nations mu&s;t mix and contend with each other. Our former wars with France probably contributed to form a Black Prince, and many other gallant officers com|manding troops and archers the be&s;t in Europe. King William, being great both as a &s;oldier and a politician, by his conti|nental wars and connections produced great and accompli&s;hed &s;tate&s;men, generals, writers; hence our Marlboroughs, Somers's, Priors, Swifts, &amp;c. The military character was always of great importance to us, and &s;eems now to be becoming highly nece&s;&s;ary again: our political place in Europe may &s;oon be &s;uch as to make it ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary for us all to learn to fight: the number and &s;ituation of our enemies may make a con&s;tant guard, and general di&s;|cipline, as nece&s;&s;ary to us as to any other more military nation; and we are con|&s;tantly &s;ubject to this danger, from the in|trigues of our enemies. The internal vigour
<PB N="153" REF="159">
and defence of each nation, the peace and &s;afety of the whole together, will con&s;tantly depend much on all being well and almo&s;t equally prepared for war.</P>
<P>I could wi&s;h it were again a fa&s;hionable part of education for mo&s;t of our young gentlemen to &s;erve a few years, and &s;hould be glad to &s;ee a little of our ancient military enthu&s;ia&s;m revived. To neglect, di&s;cou|rage, and cry down the military &s;pirit, as is u&s;ual with us in time of peace, is a mo&s;t dangerous doctrine. If country gentlemen are weak enough to be jealous of their de|fenders, why do they not learn to defend them&s;elves? It is when a &s;mall and &s;eparate part only of a nation is military, that the nation is in a real &s;tate of danger and de|bility; and our &s;afety would every way con&s;i&s;t in military knowledge and practice being general and common among us. Our dread of giving arms and di&s;cipline to the people, proceeds from our ignorance and want of experience in the&s;e matters.</P>
<P>There are certain peaceful doctrines preached up by learned, benevolent, and booki&s;h men, which mini&s;ters, in parti|cular,
<PB N="154" REF="160">
&s;hould beware of adopting, as they are unfit for this world. If they have ever been the cau&s;e of neglect or lo&s;s of mili|tary di&s;cipline, they have &s;o far contributed to the ruin of nations; for &s;uch neglect has generally preceded, ha&s;tened, or com|pleted their downfal. Long peace and &s;ecurity have always had the wor&s;t effects on the human character, producing a pro|gre&s;&s;ion of indolence, luxury, effeminacy, weakne&s;s, and national ruin. Tho&s;e doc|trines become really dangerous when they pretend to teach us to avoid the temptations to war, by laying a&s;ide the preparations for it. To fancy that the world can exi&s;t in perpetual peace, implies ignorance of the nature of man. The natural pride and in|ju&s;tice of all nations, or &s;eparate bodies of men, towards each other, mu&s;t ever pro|duce wars: they are, perhaps, as nece&s;&s;ary in the political or moral world, as &s;torms or thunder are in the natural. Perpetual peace might be as hurtful to us as perpetual fair weather: &s;o that tho&s;e &s;peculative philo&s;o|phers might be more beneficially employed in learning their military exerci&s;es; or the&s;e occupations &s;hould perhaps be mixed &s;o as
<PB N="155" REF="161">
to relieve each other, the active with the &s;edentary, arms with letters. A life of entire &s;tudy is not fit for human beings: let them preach peace and benevolence to all, and then prepare for war, and learn the u&s;e of arms: &s;ome of the be&s;t of men have done &s;o.</P>
<P>When we can get government to adopt &s;uch principles and promote &s;uch practice, and &s;hall find our young men of fa&s;hion looking abroad for every occa&s;ion to &s;ee &s;ervice, de&s;irous to join or imitate &s;uch men as a Clinton or a Carleton (who are ju&s;t gone with General Lloyd to join Ro|manzoff), in order to &s;ee the wars and manners of Turks, Ru&s;&s;ians, Tartars, Algerines, &amp;c.; and to examine the Pru&s;&s;ian and Au&s;trian armies, the &s;cientific principles of fortification and artillery, wherever the&s;e may be found in practice, as in the mountains of Piedmont or of Sile&s;ia, on the Rhine or in the plains of Flanders, or the Dutch frontiers; I &s;hall then have hopes of the revival of our mili|tary &s;pirit. On the return of &s;uch young
<PB N="156" REF="162">
men, it may &s;oon be perceived whether they under&s;tand what they have &s;een, and have imbibed the military &s;pirit: they will bring home books and plans, and will con|tinue attentive to every minute part of their duty, to the military &s;ciences, and to whatever is going on among our engineers and artillery at Woolwich, or el&s;ewhere; and you may then be pretty &s;ure they are worth your acquaintance.</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s, either of the extremes, too much military madne&s;s, or a total neglect of all di&s;cipline and defence, has each its bad con&s;equences.; yet you will readily perceive, that the &s;afe&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t would be that of war and di&s;cipline, e&s;pecially when kept within bounds by the modera|tion and wi&s;dom of a &s;teady and &s;cientific government.</P>
<P>The tendency or di&s;po&s;ition towards war or peace, may depend much on the form of government, which thereby acquires almo&s;t its greate&s;t importance. If there be any form that pretends to exclude, and make no provi&s;ion for war, or any other
<PB N="157" REF="163">
that may lead con&s;tantly towards it, we may venture to pronounce them both un|fit for men. There have been feudal and other &s;y&s;tems, that &s;eemed to make war their only object; and Quaker &s;y&s;tems that pretended to exi&s;t in eternal peace: but of both we have &s;een the precarious and &s;hort duration.</P>

<P>WE ought to &s;tudy and know much, as you ju&s;tly ob&s;erve, before we travel, and &s;hould be not only de&s;irous, but qualified to conver&s;e with all who are eminent, to catch their ideas, and profit by every thing we &s;ee. But the ta&s;k of being &s;o qualified &s;eems infinite, and life too &s;hort for half the cour&s;e in the u&s;ual way, unle&s;s we determine to da&s;h acro&s;s the country of &s;cience, by &s;ome &s;hort paths, directly at the great objects and principles of u&s;eful knowledge; like a Frederic, who &s;ees and &s;eizes at once the e&s;&s;entials on every &s;ubject, and who&s;e &s;econd thoughts are tho&s;e of a ma&s;ter and inventor.</P>
<P>As arts and &s;ociety advance, an exten|&s;ive and thorough knowledge of the world,
<PB N="159" REF="165">
joined to that of books and learning, be|comes gradually more difficult. Either of tho&s;e requires our whole attention: nay, each mu&s;t again be &s;ubdivided, and every part become the only pur&s;uit of entire bodies of men. Hence the nece&s;&s;ary con|nection of the whole mu&s;t be le&s;&s;ened or lo&s;t. In&s;tead of approaching, theory and practice will recede from, each other. However difficult it may be to join the &s;tudious with the active life, yet they mu&s;t be joined in every great character. If knowledge and activity continue to exclude each other; if the &s;tudy of books, and the &s;pirit of indu&s;try, become incompatible, the moral and political &s;ciences, which re|quire the mo&s;t active and the greate&s;t in|tellectual abilities; the mo&s;t exten&s;ive theory with practice, and &s;tudy with experience, may gradually receive le&s;s of tho&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;t|ances of which they &s;tand the mo&s;t in need: and the great ma&s;ter-&s;cience of government may yet long fall to the &s;hare of partial proficients, and feel the want of tho&s;e men of univer&s;al minds, who were anciently
<PB N="160" REF="166">
more common, more practical and enter|pri&s;ing.</P>
<P>Though &s;cience or theory is far before blind practice and routine in dignity and importance, yet I fear we are not to look for much koowledge fit for immediate u&s;e from the clo&s;et &s;peculations of the mo&s;t &s;tudious and learned: and, &s;ingular as it may appear, they who are the be&s;t or mo&s;t informed, &s;eem to go often the farthe&s;t wrong. But there does not &s;eem to be oc|ca&s;ion for more precautions again&s;t their &s;peculations. We do not find that men of bu&s;ine&s;s, or of the world, mini&s;ters or monarchs, are much inclined to mind what is &s;aid by your Rou&s;&s;eaus, Mirabeaus, Helvetiu&s;es, and many others; yet their &s;peculations may be of u&s;e at &s;ome future period.</P>
<P>However qualified you may chance to be, I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t, that all of you who can, &s;hould travel, e&s;pecially men in your high and important &s;tation, as you owe your
<PB N="161" REF="167">
be&s;t efforts, to the public. Arti&s;ts, ma|gi&s;trates; military men, all &s;hould travel, and take more enlarged views of nature and of art, of men and things, than one i&s;land can afford.</P>
<P>The public and private diver&s;ions and amu&s;ements of every country &s;hould be attended to by travellers. They may ge|nerally &s;erve to &s;hew the national ta&s;te and di&s;po&s;ition, which will then often appear without re&s;erve. I &s;hall not trouble you with particulars about the Spani&s;h bull-fea&s;ts, as they have been &s;o often de&s;cribed, though they might furni&s;h &s;ome ob&s;erva|tions on the national ta&s;te; on the habits and di&s;tinctions of cruelty and courage. I fear it is becoming the fa&s;hion to cry down the&s;e manly diver&s;ions as barbarous; I find they are not now pur&s;ued with the &s;ame &s;pirit as formerly, and gentlemen take &s;eldom, of late, a part in fighting the bull, but leave it to the hired gladiators, who are generally butchers by profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Nor &s;hould we overlook the women of any country. Some of them are found to
<PB N="162" REF="168">
be like beings of &s;uperior intelligence; and even with the mo&s;t ordinary, we may learn anecdotes, characters, or &s;ecrets, of &s;ome importance, &s;uch as may lead to what you want, and to greater things than may at fir&s;t appear. In this country, we are agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed to meet with &s;o much lively wit, grace, and &s;entiment, in the &s;ex, where there is &s;o little rea&s;on to expect any thing of the kind, amid&s;t &s;o much &s;uper|&s;tition and ignorance. Their talents and di&s;po&s;ition for mu&s;ic, their pretty little &s;ongs, and, &s;till more, their arch and fa&s;ci|nating manner of &s;inging them, come very <HI>&agrave;-propos</HI> to crown the whole of their power and influence. Though they are not free from the baneful contagion of the national &s;uper&s;tition, yet the native graces, more than the beauty of the &s;ex here, may be &s;aid to be too powerful for the devil him|&s;elf; for in &s;pite of a con&s;tant and well-cultivated dread of him, and all that their gho&s;tly and ignorant fathers can &s;ay, they are perhaps the gaye&s;t, the mo&s;t lively and agreeable women in Europe. Though their timid devotion carries them &s;o often
<PB N="163" REF="169">
to church, yet even there, the arch vivacity of their di&s;po&s;ition appears; and under the gloom of their black veils and melancholy demeanour, there pa&s;&s;es, between the &s;exes, much of that &s;ilent conver&s;ation in which they are &s;o great adepts.</P>
<P>The Spani&s;h theatre is &s;till, perhaps, nearly the &s;ame as in the time of Lopez de Vega. The living hi&s;tory of former times is here to be &s;een in various things. On their &s;tage, only intrigue, vice, roguery, low buffoonery, cruelty, and the marvel|lous, can plea&s;e them: the pieces are ge|nerally both written and &s;poken in a mo&s;t unnatural &s;talking &s;tyle of cold and pomp|ous declamation; their action on the &s;tage, &s;o cold and &s;tiff, though in common life and conver&s;ation &s;o natural, lively, and expre&s;&s;ive. As I think French tragedy, or declamation, is all one kind of lamentable bur&s;ting expre&s;&s;ion of bodily pain; &s;o that of the old actors here is all a kind of mo|notonous proud &s;tyle of whining or petu|lant rea&s;oning; and their frequent long
<PB N="164" REF="170">
&s;peeches, and cold &s;oliloquies, become very tire&s;ome indeed. Nothing &s;entimen|tal or pathetic; much high-flown figure and bomba&s;t; endle&s;s &s;trings of metaphors; much incident and intrigue, but little or nothing natural. Yet the beautiful flowery language of Lopez is charming. They have lately attempted &s;ome tran&s;lated pieces, and &s;ome tolerable imitations of the pa&s;|&s;ions, for the fir&s;t time perhaps &s;ince Cer|vantes. I have ju&s;t &s;een one of them acted, our Game&s;ter. I ob&s;erved, that the audi|ence generally laughed in ridicule at the places where I wept; at the mo&s;t pathetic parts; for it was tolerably acted by &s;ome of Olavide's di&s;ciples: but now that he is gone&mdash;to the Inqui&s;ition, and his theatrical &s;chool is no more, their native barbari&s;m will probably again prevail. They &s;tand much in need of &s;uch men, and he was introducing good ta&s;te, and a reli&s;h for truth and nature, among them, with more &s;ucce&s;s than I &s;hould have expected. However, the hi&s;tory of their &s;tage, and of their poetry, with all their defects,

<HI>acue&s;tas,</HI> would probably be the mo&s;t in|tere&s;ting part of an account of their lite|rature<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I find a very agreeable account of their poetry is &s;ince publi&s;hed by Mr. Dillon, who gave us Bowles's Natural Hi&s;tory of Spain, &amp;c.

<P>I wi&s;h the Spaniards and Italians would apply more to this art of acting and elo|cution. They would outdo all other nations, by the advantages of countenance, of habi|tual expre&s;&s;ion, manner, and animation.</P>
<P>You know the Spaniards have had their golden period of learning, and of &s;ome approaches to good ta&s;te, always with much of the fire of genius. It ro&s;e with the latter of their native monarchs &s;oon after the revival of arts and letters in Italy, declined with the power of their Au&s;trian princes, and fell with the lo&s;s of their connection and intercour&s;e with Italy, Flanders, and the other European nations. Cervantes tried to &s;top the progre&s;s of bad
<PB N="166" REF="172">
ta&s;te, but not with the &s;ucce&s;s he merited. Fal&s;e principles and bad habits had al|ready taken too deep root. He probably contributed much towards completely bani&s;hing the romantic and rather re&s;pect|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">le &s;pirit of chivalry, which was al|r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ady more than &s;ufficiently on the de|cline; but he could not &s;top the natural progre&s;s and growing love of orna|ment and affectation. Thence we may trace their love of bomba&s;t and the marvellous, the redundancy of figure and exaggeration, in writing; a ta&s;te which has reigned ever &s;ince, with very few exceptions. The decline once begun, was probably ha&s;tened by the too fertile fancy, and defective delicacy and judg|ment, of Lopez and others, and it &s;eems to have been fo&s;tered and revived, as if congenial to the fiery and extravagant ta&s;te of the nation.</P>

and u&s;eful &s;cience, they have generally been deficient. Their deep &s;chola&s;tic &s;tudies, their inve&s;tigations of antiquity, their few, though &s;uperior, labours in the fine arts, have never been &s;ufficiently con|nected with &s;ociety, nor profitable to the community.</P>

<P>THE Spaniards in general, and the Andalu&s;ians in particular, with ima|ginations &s;o warm and fertile, have a power|ful ta&s;te and di&s;po&s;ition for wit, and many of both &s;exes are great adepts in that way: with the mo&s;t compo&s;ed and &s;teady coun|tenance they will long keep the table in a roar, and are infinitely amu&s;ing: but as is u&s;ual with warm and impetuous fancy, there is often a want of delicacy, of &s;ound ta&s;te and judgment: they attempt and reli&s;h all &s;pecies of wit, and often prefer the lower and coar&s;er kinds: but let us be|ware of becoming too difficult to plea&s;e, which we Engli&s;h, I believe, often are; we may refine too much, and mu&s;t lo&s;e by being too nice and &s;queami&s;h. A good
<PB N="169" REF="175">
&s;trong appetite will dige&s;t all natural food; and genuine wit, when not too loath&s;ome with indecency, flattery, or &s;oured with &s;everity, ought always to plea&s;e. Though greatly changed and Frenchified &s;ince their Bourbon connexions, they have not yet lo&s;t all tho&s;e enthu&s;ia&s;tic and romantic no|tions which once di&s;tingui&s;hed and rai&s;ed them, however ridiculou&s;ly, above other mortals. In every rank we yet find &s;ome of tho&s;e old and dignified characters, with a certain elevation of &s;oul, and many lofty ideas, though accompanied with what our modern delicacy may con&s;ider as a ridicu|lous pride.</P>
<P>Though politically they are now of &s;mall con&s;ideration, except in their own ideas, and but little of their former na|tional greatne&s;s or character may remain, be&s;ides their pride, yet individually the country &s;till abounds in valuable characters, or rather in materials of which &s;uch cha|racters may be readily formed when want|ed. We meet with as excellent and ami|able qualities of mind as in the mo&s;t po|li&s;hed and enlightened nations: this is
<PB N="170" REF="176">
often, I believe, the ca&s;e in rude and mi&s;|governed countries; virtues ari&s;e as they are wanted, where the &s;oil and materials are good, and here they are excellent. Wi&s;e Nature &s;eems &s;olicitous in bringing every condition of &s;ociety nearly to a level of happine&s;s. If you live any time among them, you will meet with &s;ouls capable of every virtue, but may ob&s;erve how few occa&s;ions or motives there are to practi&s;e any, in this &s;tate of &s;ociety and govern|ment. They are obviou&s;ly made for gene|ro&s;ity, probity, magnanimity, re&s;olution, per&s;everance, and &s;till retain a certain cool and habitual equanimity of temper and &s;ound judgment, which we find in no other nation, joined to &s;uch warmth of heart and fancy. But, even on this foundation, you will too often find a &s;tructure of vice and ignorance; e&s;pecially in the lower cla&s;&s;es, degrees of indolence, idlene&s;s, malevo|lence, depravity of ta&s;te and di&s;po&s;ition, which exhibit at once to view the powers of habit and of a bad government, and the dregs or ruins of a mo&s;t re&s;pectable national character. The Spaniards, though na|turally
<PB N="171" REF="177">
deep and artful politicians, have &s;till &s;omething &s;o nobly frank and hone&s;t in their di&s;po&s;ition, that they are not, I think, in proportion, politically in&s;idious or treacherous, unle&s;s the French make them &s;o. Of the modern national charac|ters, I am inclined to place the Spani&s;h and Engli&s;h, &s;o nearly alike, among the fir&s;t. I believe there is likewi&s;e &s;omething rather &s;uperior &s;till perceptible in the modern Roman character, as well as in their lan|guage and manner; and al&s;o in the Mahi|notes, or modern Lacedaemonians, and in the Macedonians.</P>
<P>The manners of the politer &s;ocieties here, and of the higher ranks, are already too clo&s;ely copied from the French, who, you know, are not naturally delicate nor &s;enti|mental, but artificially refined by fa&s;hion. By means of the ladies in Spain, who readily adopt the liberty of French man|ners, which, engrafted on their own, they carry beyond the original, this nation will gradually be Frenchified, in &s;pite of all the old Dons and old antipathies. The
<PB N="172" REF="178">
women being, of late, admitted to more freedom and &s;ociety, and at a period of loo&s;e manners, retaining all their old habits of art and intrigue, the freedom of inter|cour&s;e between the &s;exes will probably be carried farther here than in the more poli&s;hed countries, who&s;e vices they have acquired, without pa&s;&s;ing through the &s;ame <HI>media</HI> or degrees of civilization and arts of luxury. Vice, in various &s;hapes, &s;eems already here to &s;talk forth almo&s;t naked and alone, unre&s;trained by habits and re|finements, which el&s;ewhere grow up with it. All leads to a coar&s;e and unadorned kind of materiali&s;m in plea&s;ure, to degrees of depravity and &s;atiety, in which they will overtake their more refined neighbours, who began the &s;ame career &s;o long before them. However, the fair &s;ex, as u&s;ual, are &s;till far more refined and &s;entimental than the men, and as they are gaining more influence in &s;ociety, may retard or regulate the progre&s;s of depravity. Every &s;tranger who &s;tays long enough to under&s;tand them, is captivated with the &s;pirit, grace, and humour of their conver&s;ation. You know
<PB N="173" REF="179">
&s;omething of the romantic force of their pa&s;&s;ions, their &s;trong and inviolable at|tachments, e&s;pecially when heightened by the difficulties of intrigue. Though the jealou&s;y of hu&s;bands &s;eems now worn out of fa&s;hion, the &s;pirit of it is pre&s;erved among the lovers, and love is &s;till an ob|ject of the fir&s;t importance in Spain. Their numerous love-&s;ongs have &s;till many graces, and though tinged with the hyperbolical fal&s;e ta&s;te of the times, are often highly ex|pre&s;&s;ive, refined, and laconic.</P>
<P>There are, as el&s;ewhere, more vices in their &s;ea-ports and capital towns, than in the re&s;t of the country where their an|cient character and di&s;tingui&s;hing manners have not yet entirely di&s;appeared; and we Engli&s;h are generally plea&s;ed and proud to cheri&s;h and to reli&s;h &s;uch remains, in oppo&s;ition to the French; while they, with a &s;neer of contempt, de&s;pi&s;e both the Spaniards and us for our bad ta&s;te in not preferring every thing that is French: in their idea, <HI>nous ne &s;ommes que des barbares tous les deux.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="180">The&s;e two nations are, to be &s;ure, as oppo&s;ite in almo&s;t every thing as nature could well make &s;uch near neighbours. Even the actual &s;tate and ta&s;te of female beauty is widely different in the two coun|tries. After ob&s;erving the prevalent &s;tyle of beauty in France, we can readily con|ceive, that <HI>Mon&s;ieur</HI> cannot much admire that of this nation; nor reli&s;h or compre|hend all the numerous Spani&s;h graces of per&s;on, manner, language, nor the high expre&s;&s;ions of phy&s;iognomy, &s;o different from, and I think far &s;uperior to, tho&s;e of his own nation. Among the fine faces here, con&s;i&s;ting of features generally large and &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ive, he finds nothing like the little round or rather &s;quare face, with the &s;nub no&s;e and pigeon's eye, which is the &s;tyle of beauty the mo&s;t com|mon and the mo&s;t e&s;teemed in France.</P>
<P>Where we find &s;uch fine abilities and natural good &s;en&s;e, joined to &s;o much ig|norance and fal&s;e ta&s;te, &s;uch loo&s;e manners and unre&s;trained vices, with great inqui&s;i|torial &s;everity in religious ob&s;ervances, it is plain, that the church, their only &s;chool,
<PB N="175" REF="181">
aims not at the improvement of morals or of learning, but at power: nay, I think the mo&s;t &s;uper&s;titious nations are the mo&s;t wicked and debauched, and we may almo&s;t mea&s;ure their degrees of vice by the ap|parent ardour of their devotion. There is, perhaps, more probity, though le&s;s ap|pearance of religion, in London, than in any other great town in Europe.</P>
<P>The Spani&s;h, like the Italian, was among the fir&s;t improved of the modern languages, and has long remained nearly in its pre&s;ent &s;tate: &s;onorous, maje&s;tic, now hyperbo|lically expre&s;&s;ive, yet full of natural beau|ties and graces, and capable of many more; &s;u&s;ceptible of almo&s;t every &s;tyle or modu|lation, but more particularly of the flow|ing, <HI>alti&s;onante y grandio&s;o,</HI> as Don Quixote &s;ays, and even of the &s;ublime; but not having been lately employed by good ta&s;te and &s;implicity, neither in many works of modern delicacy, nor with &s;ufficient free|dom in &s;ubjects of real intere&s;t and import|ance, it has not kept pace with &s;ome of its neighbouring languages and &s;till retains
<PB N="176" REF="182">
the habits of its old romantic or le&s;s an|cient bomba&s;t, even in the pro&s;e writers: though there are late e&s;&s;ays, as the <HI>Pen&s;a|dor, P. I&s;la,</HI> &amp;c. which have &s;ome claim to more natural graces, and &s;erve to &s;hew the various powers of the language. But it is &s;poken with more purity, with more dignity and politene&s;s, even by the pea&s;an|try, and with le&s;s variation, through a greater extent of country, than almo&s;t any other language in Europe; viz. through|out the two Ca&s;tiles, Leon, E&s;tremadura, La Mancha, Granada, Murcia; and in An|dalu&s;ia, though not admitted as pure or cla&s;&s;ical, it is &s;poken with a peculiar grace, &s;pirit, and &s;alt; which la&s;t is the expre&s;&s;ion here as well as in Attica. From Burgos to Malaga, you will not probably meet with a grammatical error in the conver&s;ation of any rank or individual; nor a vulgari&s;m, which indeed is a di&s;tinction almo&s;t un|known in this nation. You cannot often here, as with us and el&s;ewhere, di&s;tingui&s;h ranks and cla&s;&s;es of men by the &s;tyle of their language: all &s;peak correct and ele|gantly. With all their rags and poverty,
<PB N="177" REF="183">
yet there are no vulgar, no di&s;gu&s;ting black-guards, nor ballad-&s;ingers: even the abu&s;e, and the &s;ongs, of the meane&s;t and mo&s;t ignorant, have generally wit or poetry, good language, or ta&s;te enough to render them remarkable, or rai&s;e them above vul|garity; and you will often find the &s;ongs of your muleteer ingenious, amu&s;ing, and agreeable.</P>
<P>To attempt any tolerable account of their numerous writers, would lead us too far; and I have already, I believe, told you where to find information concerning many of them. Cervantes has produced but few &s;ucce&s;sful imitators, though they have &s;ince had poets of great wit and hu|mour; of the&s;e, you will have collections publi&s;hed. P. I&s;la's tedious novel of a friar, is far inferior to Don Quixote, and not intere&s;ting; though he gives &s;ome good pictures of low life. But when he a&s;&s;umes the philo&s;opher, and talks of Newton, &amp;c. he is poor indeed.</P>
<P>P. Feijoo, whom they celebrate &s;o highly, I think &s;carcely equal to our middling
<PB N="178" REF="184">
writers of the la&s;t century. He &s;eldom gets beyond the pre&s;ent tedious and affected manner of his nation, and makes, at be&s;t, but a &s;uper&s;titious philo&s;opher. Yet he mu&s;t have &s;ome merit, as he is &s;o generally read and e&s;teemed by his countrymen, who mu&s;t be the be&s;t judges of his &s;tyle.</P>
<P>Political writers, &s;uch as Campomanes, with the tran&s;lators and importers of foreign ideas and improvements, might be con|&s;idered as the mo&s;t u&s;eful authors here, if any authors can be of u&s;e in &s;uch a coun|try, while under &s;uch a government. It is difficult to find out, and &s;till more &s;o to apply, means &s;ufficient to open the eyes of tho&s;e determined to keep them &s;hut, or to di&s;cover the remedies that &s;hould reach the vital &s;ources where their di&s;orders originate. Changes and improvements are not more, but often le&s;s practicable for being nece&s;|&s;ary; and truth becomes le&s;s perceptible, and le&s;s attainable by its greater di&s;tance.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t ab&s;olute and determined monarch could not probably do much in this nation towards reforming the pre&s;ent
<PB N="179" REF="185">
race, &s;o far gone in indolence, ignorance, poverty, and &s;uper&s;tition: he could only prepare for the improvement of &s;ucceeding generations by wi&s;e laws, which might gra|dually produce a better con&s;titution of go|vernment, and a different race of people. I &s;hould be for his beginning with &s;uch laws as might facilitate the alienation of e&s;tates and the introduction of religious toleration. But the power of de&s;poti&s;m it&s;elf is limited by popular prejudice and ancient cu&s;tom: hence the con&s;tant endea|vours of the mo&s;t &s;agacious tyrants to level all &s;uch barriers, to bani&s;h laws and rules, and to bring all into a &s;tate of confu&s;ion, and, as they think, to a dependence on their own will. A monarch here, or even at Morocco, mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s uncommon de|grees of popularity, wi&s;dom, and &s;cience, as well as power, before he can venture to meddle with the religion of his &s;ubjects. The wor&s;t kinds of religion &s;eem to be the mo&s;t immovable, and to have the &s;tronge&s;t hold, and the mo&s;t influence, on the minds and manners of the people.</P>

<P>I PROCEED with the memorandums of our journey. From the&s;e I wi&s;h to pick you out &s;ome ob&s;ervations, and for the &s;ake of brevity they will probably be as detached and unconnected as ever. I wi&s;h not to trouble you nor my&s;elf much about local knowledge, which mu&s;t have been publi&s;hed by former travellers and an|tiquaries.</P>
<P>The two little new &s;ettlements in the Sierra Morena, of Swi&s;s and Germans, chiefly vagabonds, have not &s;ucceeded very well, but better perhaps than there was rea&s;on to expect, even in &s;pite of the op|po&s;ition
<PB N="181" REF="187">
of ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition, the con&s;tant enemies of every improvement; and again&s;t that &s;till more powerful enemy, the national government, which, in mo&s;t countries, is unfit for &s;uch detail, and parti|cularly &s;o in this. You know men in ge|neral want little more of its a&s;&s;i&s;tance than a &s;mall portion of liberty and protection; but in the ca&s;e of a new colony, &s;omewhat more was wanting, and more than this government could give, viz. that the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance &s;hould be directed by good &s;en&s;e and practical knowledge.</P>
<P>Many of the people have died, from poverty and real want, from change of climate and food, and from their own vices and helple&s;s idlene&s;s, while others have run away. Many of them being but bad &s;ub|jects in their own country, could not be ex|pected to become good citizens here. How|ever, mo&s;t of the hou&s;es fir&s;t built are &s;till inhabited, though the expected additions are not yet found nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="188">At Gran Carlotta, the hou&s;es are ill-placed, and evidently by per&s;ons who were no farmers, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of each too &s;mall; with &s;everal other material defects, which make it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible that any con&s;iderable improvement in agriculture can be introduced or extended, which was the chief object: &s;o that &s;ome of the few re|maining people have taken to making hats and ba&s;kets of &s;traw, and &s;elling them to pa&s;&s;engers.</P>
<P>On &s;eeing a ragged Spaniard &s;it playing on a guitar among the Germans that were at work, &s;ome obvious remarks on that characteri&s;tic trait were unavoidable; but two of my Spani&s;h companions were very angry with the third for joining with me in tho&s;e ob&s;ervations. This national pride might &s;urely be turned to &s;ome good ac|count by a wi&s;e government; and what contributes now to indolence and poverty, might produce indu&s;try and wealth.</P>
<P>Carolina is much prettier, and a better village, with &s;ome good gardens, fences, and trees; but it &s;eems already on the de|cline.
<PB N="183" REF="189">
Many hou&s;es and fences are neglected and in ruins, &s;ince they lo&s;t Olavide, their late excellent intendant. He was taken up by the Inqui&s;ition, chiefly for having op|po&s;ed the introduction of friars into his &s;ettlement. You may have &s;een his &s;en|tence, well calculated to &s;upport the pre|ten&s;ions of that horrid tribunal to be the fir&s;t power of the &s;tate, and its claims of controlling every other. We were told (as a &s;ecret) by &s;ome people here, that Olavide was always plea&s;ed and happy at the pro&s;perity of any one, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted each according to his merit and indu&s;try; but that his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, on the contrary, di&s;tre&s;&s;es and levies mo&s;t on the mo&s;t &s;uc|ce&s;sful, in the true modern Spani&s;h &s;pirit of finance and jealou&s;y. The original contracts of government with the&s;e poor people begin now to be infringed, which will probably &s;oon ruin the &s;ettlement, and re&s;tore the&s;e little &s;pots again to their &s;ur|rounding de&s;erts. A tax of eighty-&s;ix thou&s;and reals has been lately levied on their wines, again&s;t an expre&s;s article of their agreement. The funds for repairs
<PB N="184" REF="190">
have been dimini&s;hed, and diverted to other purpo&s;es. The great plea&s;ure of finding here milk, butter, and chee&s;e, you will not ea&s;ily conceive.</P>
<P>There is much fine land on the Guadal|quivir, or great river, and it might ea&s;ily be made navigable again to Cordova at lea&s;t, which would help greatly to improve the country, and from this one river might i&s;&s;ue &s;upplies for half Europe, in oils, wines, &amp;c. There is much rich low land in the plains of Seville, and &s;ome remains of former good methods of Moori&s;h culti|vation, as well as in Murcia and Valencia. But &s;till, for &s;o rich a &s;oil, the population and villages are but thin; though they are &s;aid to have been very numerous dur|ing the time of the Romans, and after|wards of the Moors. We may find &s;ome information on this &s;ubject from various authors; and particularly, I am told, from a Moori&s;h writer, <HI>Racis.</HI></P>
<P>Cordova occupies a noble &s;ituation on the banks of this river, &s;urrounded by a great variety of rich and grand country.
<PB N="185" REF="191">
Before it, to the &s;outh, is a boundle&s;s but varied plain: behind, to the north, are the &s;ublime mountains of Sierra Morena, full of woods, water, and a variety of &s;oils,&mdash;of charming &s;ituations, where the Romans, and afterwards the Moors, had many delightful country-hou&s;es and palaces; but it is now all a howling wilderne&s;s.</P>
<P>Were I king of Spain, I think this &s;hould be my capital, for many rea&s;ons. I would go to Seville in winter, and perhaps to Granada in Augu&s;t. The river would then &s;oon become navigable much higher. I &s;hould be within a day's journey of Seville, Cadiz, Granada, and little more from Car|thagena. With tho&s;e places &s;o near, al|mo&s;t in &s;ight from my magnificent moun|tains, I think I could govern the world; but I hope I &s;hould be liberal enough not to attempt it, but only &s;hew them how to govern them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Many hou&s;es, and I believe whole towns, have been built from the ruins of tho&s;e of the Romans, the beauties of which, their barbarous conquerors and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors could
<PB N="186" REF="192">
neither reli&s;h nor e&s;timate. Such is the melancholy hi&s;tory of nations and their works, de&s;troying and de&s;troyed by turns; &s;o that it is more &s;urpri&s;ing that any thread of their &s;tory &s;hould be pre&s;erved, than that it &s;hould be lo&s;t. The Moors were merci|le&s;s de&s;troyers at fir&s;t, and even after they were con&s;iderably advanced, and had learn|ed to build, they u&s;ed to cram the elegant capitals, friezes, in&s;criptions of the Romans, often turned up&s;ide down, into the com|mon walls of their huge and melancholy buildings. And even when mo&s;t improved by riches and luxury, their manners and character &s;till retained the &s;ame dull melan|choly ca&s;t, which probably proceeded from their former A&s;iatic habits of a reclu&s;e and jealous way of living; and this is what may have contributed mo&s;t to give the &s;ame turn to the ta&s;te and character of the Spaniards, their neighbours and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, which has la&s;ted &s;o long, and is only be|ginning of late to wear out.</P>
<P>I think it likewi&s;e appears, from their remains, that the Moors never cultivated any of the fine arts with any tolerable &s;uc|ce&s;s,

except poetry. Some of the u&s;eful arts and trades were improved, perhaps to &s;ome &s;mall degree of ta&s;te, or rather of neat|ne&s;s. They &s;eem never to have had any idea of out&s;ide architecture, or of &s;hewing the beauties of their habitations, or any indication of their happine&s;s, to the world. All their plea&s;ures were ever jealou&s;ly &s;hut up from the view of their fellow-creatures. To what a number of &s;ocial virtues and plea&s;ures they mu&s;t have been &s;trangers! None of the fine arts can probably be in|troduced or flouri&s;h without architecture, which mu&s;t lead, and partly govern the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Some of their palaces, which on the out&s;ide looked like pri&s;ons, have however been &s;upplied with luxuriant ornaments and conveniencies within. Among the&s;e, the works in pla&s;ter make the fir&s;t and be&s;t figure: but their painting and &s;culpture were wretched.

<P>The Ea&s;tern &s;elfi&s;h reclu&s;e way of life; the &s;eparation of the &s;exes, of trades, fa|milies, tribes; we may con&s;ider as a lead|ing principle, which will help to explain the&s;e, and many other &s;triking differences between their arts and manners, and tho&s;e of Europe. Hence their ignorance of the powers of mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and of the progre&s;s in mechanical inventions and im|provements; of divided and of united labour; of manufactories, and of armies: hence their &s;imple and independent little ways of each workman doing every thing for him&s;elf; their great proficiency in many dome&s;tic trades and employments, and their weakne&s;s in the aggregate: hence their want of &s;ocial virtues and talents, and hence their ignorance of all &s;pecies of government, except de&s;poti&s;m, may be chiefly deduced.</P>
<P>Yet they had &s;ome liking for the beauties of nature and of plea&s;ant &s;ituations; but when they found them, they &s;eemed only

de&s;irous to &s;hut them up, with their huge mud or taby walls. The&s;e they contrived to make &s;tick together, &s;o as to la&s;t a long time, though never equally with tho&s;e of &s;tone, as &s;ome have thought. This mode of building you may find de&s;cribed in va|rious authors and dictionaries. The choice and mixture of the materials mu&s;t have been the e&s;&s;ential parts of the art. When well worked and brought to the con&s;i&s;tency of clay, or &s;tiff mortar, it was then ram|med, by &s;mall portions, on the wall, while confined by frames, which were afterwards removed as the work dried. This method, as well as that of pla&s;ter and many others, took its ri&s;e from a littlene&s;s in their ways of working, and from their want of power to manage great weights. Yet they indu&s;triou&s;ly improved the arts of agricul|ture, which mu&s;t have advanced &s;everal others; and we know they &s;edulou&s;ly &s;tudied and improved the &s;ciences, and were then by far the fir&s;t people of their time.

<P>We could find only two arti&s;ts here, Frenchmen, and they are but poorly &s;up|ported, chiefly by the church. But they are on the point of departure. Some of their be&s;t works, &s;tatues, and va&s;es, which they had been long preparing for the public walk here, were thrown down and de&s;troy|ed the fir&s;t night, by the barbarous popu|lace, to the great mortification of the poor arti&s;ts, and of the <HI>Corregidor,</HI> a man of &s;ome ta&s;te, who had before improved the public walks of E&s;ija.

<P>A decent public walk <HI>(Alameda)</HI> to every town, is a very agreeable and com|mendable part of public police, and is &s;till kept up in Spain with more a&s;&s;iduity and good ta&s;te, than in many better countries.</P>

<P>Spain and Spaniards might probably be con&s;iderably improved, if their gentlemen could be made to travel more, for they are perhaps the be&s;t travellers of us all, as Rou&s;&s;eau ob&s;erves; and if the church could be per&s;uaded to &s;et bounds to her|&s;elf, and more ea&s;ily admit of &s;trangers and heretics.

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XX.</HI> Nobility. Mirth and Happine&s;s. Antiqui|ties. Arts and Population.</HEAD>
<P>IN con&s;idering the nobility of &s;ome coun|tries, we are led to doubt whether the fir&s;t and mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed ranks of men be always the be&s;t part of the nation, and mu&s;t &s;u&s;pect that there may be in the na|ture of hereditary honours a tendency to|wards degeneracy. To keep a body of nobility up to the true &s;pirit of honour and virtue, perpetual and powerful motives to exertion are probably requi&s;ite; &s;uch as the &s;entiments of chivalry, maintained by &s;ome con&s;tant great employ, as that of war or of legi&s;lation, and all other great objects of public weal. In &s;uch a government as this, tho&s;e motives cannot probably exi&s;t in force and quantity &s;ufficient for the pur|po&s;e. Where they have &s;o little hopes of
<PB N="198" REF="204">
any &s;ignal employment, and are excluded from the management of public affairs, and even of their own, a life and character di&s;po&s;ed to idlene&s;s and di&s;&s;ipation at lea&s;t, are among the con&s;equences to be ex|pected.</P>
<P>If old families were not to wear out, and become extinct, leaving room for a fre&s;h &s;upply, a <HI>corps de noble&s;&s;e</HI> would pro|bably degenerate much fa&s;ter. The fir&s;t man of his family is frequently worth all the re&s;t of it who come after him: indeed, we cannot expect in his pampered po&s;terity to find much of his &s;pirit or character, which was probably formed by a life of hard&s;hips, dangers, and difficulties: whence then this his anxious care in providing for his po&s;terity &s;uch a load of riches and honours as may probably render them good for nothing? This que&s;tion may cau&s;e you to think and produce various &s;peculations on &s;o important a &s;ubject, and on human nature and &s;ociety, which is the chief end of the&s;e Letters. Your Engli&s;h nobility, from being hereditary legi&s;lators and judges,
<PB N="199" REF="205">
and being forced into a more temperate kind of pride, are led to have recour&s;e to other merits be&s;ides tho&s;e of birth; and may be longer kept up to their proper cha|racter.</P>
<P>Speculative philo&s;ophers, and book-men, may be indulged in the common cant of ill-treating heroes and conquerors, as the greate&s;t and be&s;t of them will always re|quire &s;ome control. But if titles and pre|eminence were only acquired, as they ought to be, by really &s;erving the public, we &s;hould find by the general voice, that emi|nence in war fir&s;t, and then in legi&s;lation or government, would mo&s;t ennoble and di&s;tin|gui&s;h men in &s;ociety. The employments that require the &s;tronge&s;t minds and mo&s;t vigorous exertions, mu&s;t be of the greate&s;t importance, and military honours will gene|rally hold the fir&s;t rank; nor can it pro|bably long remain otherwi&s;e in any nation, as war will ever be nece&s;&s;ary, at times, while men are men. In the greate&s;t cha|racters, you &s;ee that of a warrior has ever been the chief requi&s;ite; and this has al|ways
<PB N="200" REF="206">
been perceived by &s;uch men; and on their early perception of it, have their ri&s;e and future greatne&s;s been built. The modern orders of nobility, though origin|ally military, having lo&s;t much of the an|cient &s;pirit and purity of chivalry, may have greatly changed, and probably weaken|ed the force and enthu&s;ia&s;m of character in the fir&s;t ranks of men: hence a frequent and nece&s;&s;ary recour&s;e, in modern times, to new military di&s;tinctions: and &s;ome wi&s;e prince may yet find a great re&s;ource in di&s;tributing honours according to their original intention, and in be&s;towing the highe&s;t titles on military merit. It is &s;aid, they are trying this in Ru&s;&s;ia, but I be|lieve it requires a free or mixed govern|ment to give &s;uch a mea&s;ure all its effect: with them it is only a piece of fooli&s;h af|fectation, with which that court &s;eems full as plentifully &s;tored as any other. This, and &s;everal other of her a&s;&s;uming operations, look as if Ru&s;&s;ia laid her&s;elf out entirely for conque&s;t, and only &s;erve to make the world jealous and afraid of her, with|out cau&s;e; for &s;he cannot in fact be in a

&s;tate to produce real dread or danger to Europe, perhaps for many ages to come; and then the world may all be improved and civilized, which will render any gene|ral conque&s;t impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>If the European governments have mo&s;t of them a gradual tendency towards a re|fined &s;pecies of de&s;poti&s;m; if the old ro|mantic notions of honour, and all the re|mains of chivalry, mu&s;t, by degrees, wear out, and the races of nobles naturally de|generate, while the people, or third e&s;tate, are nobody (except with you), and mu&s;t therefore afford but a bad &s;upply to recruit the <HI>corps de noble&s;&s;e;</HI> what control will then remain over mankind, the governors or governed, both naturally more vicious and improvident as government degenerates into tyranny, and gets beyond all re&s;traint? Where will nations then find virtue and honour &s;ufficient to arre&s;t, or even regulate the progre&s;s of depravity, and prevent the ruin of them&s;elves and their po&s;terity? What can then &s;top the decline of this old and worn-out part of the world? Europe mu&s;t, perhaps, in time follow the &s;teps
<PB N="202" REF="208">
and the fate of A&s;ia, e&s;pecially if &s;he &s;hould ever be tempted again to pur&s;ue her con|que&s;ts in that quarter. But I &s;hall not now trouble you with pro&s;ecuting the&s;e airy &s;pe|culations any farther; they are only &s;tarted as hints for your future con&s;ideration, and not unworthy the attention of the philo&s;o|pher who watches the tendency of our manners and &s;y&s;tems of government.</P>
<P>But to return to Spain. Many mi&s;take the pre&s;ent character of the Spaniards, and particularly their jealou&s;y and gravity. I believe you will find le&s;s jealou&s;y, and more good mirth among them, than in all the affected gaiety and noi&s;e of &s;ome of their neighbours. There is, to be &s;ure, in the very exce&s;s and abundance of their wit, joy, and good-humour, a certain &s;teady evenne&s;s of manner, equally di&s;tant from levity, as from pedantry or affectation: this is ob&s;ervable in all they do. With a kind of dry and grave humour, one of the company will often talk or &s;ing all the re&s;t into an extreme of mirth and laughter, pre&s;erving all the while a mo&s;t &s;erene and
<PB N="203" REF="209">
placid firmne&s;s of countenance him&s;elf, <HI>como quien no dice nada.</HI> We find in them more mirth and happine&s;s than may at fir&s;t &s;eem compatible with their poverty and in|dolence. But fortunately, &s;uch is often the lot of poor countries: <HI>poco bien y bien qui&s;to.</HI> The &s;carcity of good things &s;eems to be fully compen&s;ated by the more lively enjoyment of the few they retain. Some wants and difficulties &s;eem to be among the nece&s;&s;ary ingredients of human life: we are &s;oon &s;poiled by plenty and indul|gence. Voluntary exertions cannot al|ways be equal to tho&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity. Riches and &s;ucce&s;s will, in general, di|mini&s;h our powers both of body and mind, by removing at once the &s;ources of exer|tions and enjoyment. Human nature happily accommodates it&s;elf to &s;ituation; and this cheerful, though carele&s;s manner of wearing their chains, is probably the be&s;t for the pre&s;ent condition of the&s;e people, <HI>y a&s;i no ay mal que por bien no venga,</HI> as Sancho's &s;tories go: every thing has its u&s;e. When we think of improving the world, we &s;hould fir&s;t con&s;ider well,
<PB N="204" REF="210">
whether happine&s;s may not be already more equally di&s;tributed than could be done by all our wi&s;dom and benevolence; and that every con&s;iderable alteration in &s;ociety &s;hould be much wanted and de|&s;ired by the people them&s;elves before it is attempted: let us not force it on them before we have taught them to wi&s;h for it.</P>
<P>This country affords more objects for the antiquary than the arti&s;t: few re|markable pieces of modern art are to be found, except in the royal palaces: yet Spain, you know, has produced &s;ome good painters and tolerable architects; a few of the&s;e have &s;truck out new paths, I think, with &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s. The builder of the E&s;curial was a man of genius, and had grand ideas. If it was really intended to be built in the form of a gridiron, the idea probably came from Philip.</P>
<P>The remains of antiquity here have been learnedly treated by their own anti|quaries, though not yet &s;ufficiently dug up by the workmen: and the&s;e are hither|to
<PB N="205" REF="211">
objects of mere curio&s;ity, without any influence on the national ta&s;te or improve|ment, as with you, where your carpenters and &s;miths begin already to work in the &s;tyle of tho&s;e of Greece and Rome. I hope you now perceive, that the 8000 <HI>l.</HI> to Sir W. H&mdash;, for tho&s;e mu&s;eum antiquities, was not thrown away; and we may hope that the labours of a Bentley, a Wedge|wood, and other ingenious manufacturers, will turn to public benefit, and the diffu|&s;ion of good ta&s;te.</P>
<P>The Spaniards might learn many good things from the Roman monuments and antiquities; as, the police, management, and divi&s;ion of the country; roads and modes of communication; methods of building, of watering, cultivating, and di|viding their lands; in various arts and trades: they might al&s;o learn much from &s;ome of the&s;e Germans, and other fo|reigners; from Catalonia, and &s;till more from Bi&s;caya, and &s;ometimes even at their own doors: they have many examples &s;cattered about the kingdom of what they
<PB N="206" REF="212">
ought to do: but it is too plain, that no example, or temporary public a&s;&s;i&s;tance, can have its natural effects here. Some of the fine&s;t parts of their country are the lea&s;t peopled, their exten&s;ive <HI>&s;ierras:</HI> this of Sierra Morena, which extends from Murcia to Portugal, is full of fine vallies, with a variety of &s;oils, of wood and water, which are all wanting in their arid plains, the only parts they have attempted to in|habit, and which are accordingly very thinly peopled and mi&s;erably cultivated. They &s;eem determined to &s;pare no la|bour in counteracting nature, and ju&s;tly &s;ucceed in proportion to the wi&s;dom of their efforts.</P>
<P>There are more paintings at Seville than at Cordova. We found there &s;ome gen|tlemen collectors, and a good many pieces of Morillo, particularly in the convent where he ended his days. This devout way of pa&s;&s;ing the latter part of life in con|vents, continues &s;till to be the fa&s;hion in Spain, in which they are perhaps more con|&s;i&s;tent with their principles than our&s;elves.

<P>WE have pa&s;&s;ed through an e&s;tate of the duke of Alva, near Cordova, a country abounding in beauties, as u&s;ual about the &s;kirts of mountains, but more particularly about this &s;ublime Sierra Mo|rena. It was there the late Duke was bani&s;hed, and he con&s;iderably improved the lands, planting olive-woods, building &s;ome good oil-mills, &s;tores, &amp;c. We found a wheel on the river, forty feet dia|meter, which rai&s;ed water nearly to that height, for watering &s;ome gardens, &s;o &s;imple as to require no attendance, but only repairs.</P>
<P>La Mancha&mdash;the country of the re|nowned Don Quixote, may be remarked

for &s;implicity, poverty, mirth, and mu&s;ic. The country re&s;embles mo&s;t of the other internal Spani&s;h plains, a dry, naked, brown clay, without a green &s;pot, and hardly a &s;hrub to be &s;een, except when the vines are in leaf. But in the&s;e few poor clay villages, there is plenty of good wine and good bread, and nothing but dancing and &s;inging in or out of doors all the evenings. Poverty and mirth go together in the&s;e happy climes.</P>
<P>This &s;eems the original country of tho&s;e charming little &s;ongs called <HI>Seguidillas;</HI> their natural &s;oil, where they grow &s;pon|taneou&s;ly, made often <HI>extempore,</HI> and &s;eldom written or noted down. Great numbers are made, &s;ung, and danced here, which are never known in the re&s;t of Spain, and they are probably more in the true old national ta&s;te, than even at Madrid. I was &s;orry I had not time to make a larger collection of them. We could willingly, and plea&s;antly, have pa&s;&s;ed much more time in &s;ome of tho&s;e poor places. There is, in Spani&s;h manners, in the language,
<PB N="210" REF="216">
mirth, and <HI>gracia</HI> of the people, a &s;ome|thing that attaches and engages tho&s;e who enter into the ta&s;te and &s;pirit of it, but which, till then, is incomprehen&s;ible to the &s;tranger or pa&s;&s;ing vi&s;itor.</P>
<P>We might almo&s;t mea&s;ure the degrees of bad government, in different countries, by the de&s;truction or want of timber. In Spain, &s;carce a tree is to be &s;een, except &s;uch as yet grow among inacce&s;&s;ible mountains. It is &s;aid that timber dimini&s;hes even in England, where &s;o much is planted. Man is a de&s;tructive animal where he is not well treated. He requires good u&s;age, and great &s;ecurity, to render him provident for a future day, and e&s;pecially for po&s;terity.</P>
<P>We met &s;ome of the <HI>ganado merino,</HI> or fine wool &s;heep, in large &s;traggling flocks, on their travels from the northern moun|tains to winter in the &s;outhern plains. Some flocks travel above a hundred long leagues twice a year. But Bowles will give you all the particulars. Salt is a nece&s;&s;ary part of their food. There is &s;till, I find, &s;ome di&s;pute even here about the proper quan|tity.
<PB N="211" REF="217">
The breeding of tho&s;e fine wool &s;heep is probably only fit for a country like this, thinly inhabited, little cultivated, and without fences: but I doubt of its being the mo&s;t profitable kind of produce, even here, where every thing would grow, I believe, with a little more pains, and more water, both of which might be had. However, this wool has long been a na|tional object in Spain: they have a code of laws on purpo&s;e. The privileges of the <HI>Me&s;ta</HI> (or &s;heep company) probably pre|vent inclo&s;ures, planting, and improve|ments: the want of trees mo&s;t likely con|tributes to their want of water. It &s;eems the fine wool is worth above a hundred reals <HI>per aroba,</HI> but the common &s;ort only twelve or fifteen.</P>
<P>Let all &s;tates beware of great corporate bodies of people, and admit even &s;mall ones only on very good and obvious rea|&s;ons. The natural &s;ubdivi&s;ion of &s;ociety is into families; collective bodies more numerous may be dangerous or injurious to the public, and may be ea&s;ily brought
<PB N="212" REF="218">
to combine again&s;t the re&s;t of the nation. The principles and formation of great companies and corporations are not yet well under&s;tood. England, Holland, &amp;c. after having got rid of the old &s;tyle of monopolies, are probably launching again too far, in admitting new kinds of cor|porate bodies, of <HI>imperia in imperio.</HI> The true &s;pirit and natural operations of tho&s;e may not be under&s;tood, till one, or &s;ome ea&s;y combination of them, &s;hall &s;eize or over-rule the &s;tate.</P>
<P>There mu&s;t be much nitre in the air here, or the earth mu&s;t be well adapted for generating or extracting it from thence, or both; for the &s;ame heaps of earth, without any change, addition, or mixture, give nearly the &s;ame quantity of &s;altpetre every year, at the works near Tembleque.

This is a &s;mall town with eleven convents. The plan of this &s;chool, like mo&s;t other Spani&s;h ideas on public matters, is too great ever to be completed. Their de&s;igns are generally gigantically magnificent, and impracticable: Muley I&s;hmael's palaces. If all the &s;ix or &s;even military &s;chools, &s;cattered about this kingdom, were united into one or two, they would pro|bably be attended with more effect and oeconomy.</P>
<P>The modern practice of dividing and &s;ubdividing labour, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary in mo&s;t arts and trades, is apt to be carried too far, and to be adopted where it is unnece&s;&s;ary, or hurtful, as in the military. Since this &s;pirit of &s;eparating things which are na|turally connected, has taken place; &s;ince we attend more to fancied and forced di&s;tinctions, than to natural connections of things, and are lo&s;t in a diminutive &s;tyle of minute philo&s;ophy; I think the &s;trength of genius and of fancy has di|mini&s;hed, and the human mind has de|generated, &s;ince tho&s;e times when a man

could be at once a &s;tate&s;man, philo&s;opher, &s;oldier, mu&s;ician, poet, author, &amp;c. But a man now takes only a part of a profe&s;|&s;ion, and is fit for nothing el&s;e. Even an officer of hor&s;e is often a novice in the affairs of infantry. I &s;hould rather be in|clined to think, with Cicero and Vitru|vius, that no man can be very great in any thing of importance, without knowing almo&s;t every thing. All is connected in this world: though, I believe, I preach|ed this doctrine before to our friend C&mdash;; I wi&s;h you, in particular, to con&s;ider it well, that you may endeavour to become great as a &s;oldier, a &s;enator, a farmer, &amp;c. for they all a&s;&s;i&s;t each other.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XXII.</HI> Madrid. Arts. People. E&s;curial. Old Ca&s;tile. Flocks. Towns. Church. Corn. Water. Government.</HEAD>
<P>I WISH to ha&s;ten through this journey, which you may begin to think rather tire&s;ome, as I do; and I mu&s;t tell you, for your comfort, that mo&s;t other Spani&s;h travellers think the &s;ame. However, with your youth, curio&s;ity, and a little more practice in the language, you may ea&s;ily, and even plea&s;antly, get over all their mag|nified difficulties. Though I do not intend to trouble you with many particulars, I will not promi&s;e that &s;ome reflections may not &s;till interrupt our progre&s;s, and exerci&s;e your patience, for which you will have &s;o much occa&s;ion here.</P>
<P>Of <HI>Madrid,</HI> the particulars I &s;hall leave to other ample accounts, already publi&s;hed: it is now a tolerably clean country town,
<PB N="217" REF="223">
with &s;ome few good &s;treets and buildings; but no plea&s;ant environs: the moment you get without the gates, you may fancy your&s;elf in a Spani&s;h de&s;ert again. The king has an excellent collection of pictures in his new and magnificent palace: but you have, and will &s;oon have more labour|ed accounts of all the&s;e things, by profe&s;&s;ed connoi&s;&s;eurs.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be allowed, that mo&s;t princes now take &s;ome pains to encourage and re|vive the arts; but the&s;e do not &s;eem to an&s;wer the call anywhere &s;o readily as with you; and it gives plea&s;ure to fancy and fore&s;ee them repairing to our i&s;land to increa&s;e and multiply, as to a better &s;oil than they can now find in any other coun|try. It would &s;eem, that the&s;e great monarchs of the world have lo&s;t the &s;ecret of alluring or propagating them. I do not hear of any Spani&s;h &s;tudents above medio|crity. Wealth, &s;ecurity, then lei&s;ure, travel and various motives, mu&s;t con|&s;pire to produce a ta&s;te for the beauties of nature and the ancients. Princes do not
<PB N="218" REF="224">
&s;eem to know, that if all the arts and &s;ciences were &s;omehow, by chance or force, introduced into any country that is badly or de&s;potically governed, and hence defective in &s;ecurity, they could not be fixed, or remain there, but would mo&s;t probably di&s;appear with the generation that introduced them.</P>
<P>This town of Madrid is not yet a very healthy place I believe, from what we can learn, and from the bilious &s;allow agui&s;h appearance of its inhabitants: they are not in general a &s;tout nor a hand&s;ome people, and have a certain look of &s;ecret di&s;content or re&s;ignation, or &s;omething between the&s;e, which is ea&s;ier to ob&s;erve than explain.</P>
<P>Though the Spaniards, in general, may not appear to you, at fir&s;t, &s;o hand&s;ome or good looking a people as &s;ome other of the more northern races, yet in other parts of the kingdom, you will find, after a little habit and examination, that they have a certain regularity and graceful &s;trength of countenance beyond mo&s;t other nations:
<PB N="219" REF="225">
and that they have more bodily &s;trength, vigour, and &s;pirit, than their dry and meagre appearance may &s;eem to indicate; and this will appear on the few occa&s;ions that occur to excite their exertion.</P>
<P>The <HI>E&s;curial</HI>&mdash;a romantic bold &s;ituation, on the hills that &s;kirt the Guadarrama range of mountains. The building, in the bold and &s;imple Doric, &s;o uncommon and unexpected in &s;uch a country: yet, on the whole, I think it far beneath the degrees and effects of beauty and grandeur, which might be expected from &s;o much labour and materials: and, as u&s;ual, this, and every thing in the country, &s;eems doomed to be &s;poilt by &s;omething or other di&s;agreeably melancholy, dirty, or mean: here, a number of &s;mall and broken win|dows; a want of repairs, and of cleanli|ne&s;s; an ugly weather-beaten kind of &s;tone, &amp;c. all contribute to give to the whole a tri&s;te and uninhabited appearance. The neglected &s;tate of the grounds and fences, the dulne&s;s of the court, and want of amu&s;ements, may &s;trike one with
<PB N="220" REF="226">
Moori&s;h ideas and re&s;emblances: but I do not mean to dwell much in or on palaces, and mu&s;t again refer you to others.</P>
<P>We go on from the E&s;curial, a&s;cending the&s;e Guadarrama mountains, and from the highe&s;t get a view of the great plains of Old Ca&s;tile before us; and look back upon tho&s;e of the new, behind us, over Madrid, and far beyond it: both ways a grand and exten&s;ive, but not a very cheerful, pro|&s;pect: a naked brown country during great part of the year. If I could chu&s;e my party, I believe I &s;hould like better to exa|mine the&s;e wild and romantic mountains than tho&s;e half-peopled plains: all their mountains are full of intere&s;ting objects, and of &s;ublime and beautiful &s;cenes; but they are few, and di&s;tant from each other.</P>
<P>I do not find much that is worth copy|ing and con&s;idering from the <HI>memoranda</HI> of &s;everal journies through the now naked plains of Old Ca&s;tile and Leon; where there is, indeed, &s;o little to be &s;een, be|&s;ides &s;ome &s;cattered flocks of &s;heep, and a few clay towns and villages, very thinly
<PB N="221" REF="227">
&s;cattered, full of dirt, poverty, and ruins, appearing as if lately burnt down: &s;carce a tree, or any thing green, to be &s;een dur|ing mo&s;t of the year; often in want of water, of timber, and of every thing comfortable; only &s;traw for fuel, beds, &s;eats, &amp;c. In &s;ome of the wool towns, <HI>i. e.</HI> where the wool is wa&s;hed, we &s;aw &s;ome hou&s;es with a few gla&s;s windows, as a very rare &s;ight.</P>
<P>We found that tho&s;e large flocks of &s;heep belong mo&s;tly to a few great proprietors, chiefly nobility, who live in Madrid, while their wretched and neglected country &s;eems given up to wa&s;te, or to the&s;e few &s;cattered flocks, and ragged &s;olitary &s;hepherds: but their management of wool and &s;heep, Spain has retained perhaps better than any other art; and in its pre&s;ent &s;tate, is pro|bably one of the fitte&s;t for producing wool, and if it mu&s;t want water, there is much of it that can hardly be turned to any other u&s;e: for which rea&s;on I think it is not the country fitte&s;t for working up the wool, nor for many other operations that require great population and indu&s;try. The pro|ducing
<PB N="222" REF="228">
and the working up of materials, are not nece&s;&s;arily, nay are often incom|patible, in the &s;ame country: a country of &s;hepherds cannot be full of manufac|tures: &s;ome countries we find &s;it for one thing, and &s;ome for another; &s;ome to pro|duce materials, others to fabricate them: and if each nation would be wi&s;e enough to keep to its own natural &s;taple, it would doubtle&s;s be much better for the world at large. Yet they might, and would pro|bably have &s;ome more manufactories in their towns here, if their government had any wi&s;dom or goodne&s;s to refrain from taxing them, and to give &s;ufficient &s;ecu|rity, liberty, toleration: or rather if they were to aboli&s;h this government, and create a new one. Of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of Spain, I hope you begin to form &s;ome general ideas, which I think are &s;ufficient, and always the be&s;t, to begin with: a general notion of its natural hi&s;tory you may ac|quire from <HI>Bowles,</HI> and our good friend D. <HI>Ign. A&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> may &s;hew you his &s;ubterrane|ous or mineralogic map of it. The&s;e ex|ten&s;ive plains con&s;i&s;t of other le&s;&s;er ones,
<PB N="223" REF="229">
of different heights or levels, &s;inking &s;ud|denly by &s;teep precipices, where two or three different &s;trata appear, of &s;everal yards thickne&s;s each, all horizontal: the upper &s;tratum vi&s;ibly form the &s;urrounding mountains, though at a great di&s;tance. Such is the make, and I think, a tolerable &s;hort de&s;cription of this, and of &s;everal other great plains in the world.</P>
<P>Their chief towns lie among the &s;kirts of the different mountains that almo&s;t &s;ur|round this great plain, as Segovia, Valla|dolid, Burgos, Leon, A&s;torga (for ac|counts of which &s;ee Pontz). There, the country generally begins to be more varied, more inter&s;per&s;ed with villages and culti|vation, and we can &s;ee that it has for|merly been &s;till more &s;o: ruins of villages, ca&s;tles, and cultivation, may yet be traced: and in tho&s;e cities, &s;ome melancholy re|mains of ancient magnificence &s;till appear through their pre&s;ent ruins, filth, and po|verty. Burgos I think one of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting of the&s;e towns; it was formerly the re&s;idence of their princes. Some &s;treets,
<PB N="224" REF="230">
con&s;i&s;ting of old palaces of former nobility, appeared to be &s;carcely habitable, but we were told that they are &s;till occupied by genteel families; poor gentry, of which this country has &s;till &s;ome remains, too proud and too lazy to work.</P>
<P>There is &s;carcely any thing in tolerable order in Spain but their churches: the old cathedral here is one of their fine&s;t Gothic &s;tructures. Though the parts are of very different and capricious &s;tyles of architecture; the whole is noble without being heavy: but the Greek and the Gothic never join well, in my opinion, though the moderns are always attempting it, as here, and I think &s;till without &s;ucce&s;s. They tell us, this place is much improved &s;ince the wool duties began to be collected in it, and the export turned to St. Ander; it mu&s;t then have been wretched indeed before that period.</P>
<P>Leon may have been, and might ea&s;ily again be made a very fine city: &s;ituated on &s;ome &s;mall rivers, as they i&s;&s;ue from the mountains to the north of it, and which
<PB N="225" REF="231">
form a noble back ground, with much fine country and good &s;oil all around. Here is a charming convent or abbey, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the prie&s;ts of St. Jago: but Pontz will &s;oon give us large accounts of all the&s;e.</P>
<P>They have, however, in the&s;e dry brown plains of Ca&s;tile, &s;ometimes tolerable crops of wheat, and of a good hard grain; but they attempt little or no other produce. Poverty, the church, and want of markets for their &s;urplus produce, if they had any, are among their greate&s;t, and are quite &s;ufficient, ob&s;tacles to their improvement in agriculture. It would doubtle&s;s be difficult, and has hitherto been impo&s;&s;ible, to open a communication &s;ufficient to tran&s;port corn from the&s;e inland parts, which are &s;hut up from the &s;ea and from each other by mountains. The plans long in agitation, of roads and canals for the&s;e purpo&s;es, have not been formed with any adequate preci&s;ion or knowledge of the &s;ubject or of the country, and are im|practicable in its pre&s;ent &s;tate of popula|tion. They complain likewi&s;e of a want
<PB N="226" REF="232">
and uncertainty of water and of crops; but this was not always the ca&s;e; or at lea&s;t not to &s;o great a degree, when better planted and peopled. We know, that in former times corn has been exported from Spain, and that numerous armies and in|habitants have been &s;upported in the&s;e now naked de&s;erts; there mu&s;t then have been &s;ome mode of watering them, to a certain extent. Some Roman remains &s;hew us one very good and &s;imple me|thod of watering certain di&s;tricts, by forming large re&s;ervoirs, like lakes, of the &s;treams as they i&s;&s;ue from the mountains; by great embankments at proper places; and then by letting off the water in &s;mall channels to the lower grounds. This method is practi&s;ed in Portugal, and there are &s;ome Roman works of this kind &s;till in u&s;e near Merida and at Alicant; and remains of them at other places. Such re&s;ources &s;eem ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to agri|culture in the internal parts of this penin|&s;ula, where there is generally a want of rain during the &s;ummer and autumn quarters.
<PB N="227" REF="233">
We can hardly judge, from the appear|ance of a country in its de&s;ert and un|cultivated &s;tate, of what it may be ca|pable, nor of its former appearance when cultivated and populous: even the nece&s;|&s;ary moi&s;ture of the &s;oil may have di&s;ap|peared from the&s;e plains with the trees and cultivation: in that &s;tate, &s;ome countries become gradually covered with &s;and, which would be prevented by annual tillage.</P>
<P>But all the&s;e ob&s;tacles of nature, which I &s;u&s;pect they exaggerate, might be con|&s;iderably overcome, if tho&s;e of mi&s;taken policy and bad government were once re|moved. In &s;hort, I mu&s;t frequently repeat my text, that the form of government, or of &s;ociety, is of the fir&s;t importance, how|ever overlooked or mi&s;taken by travellers, poets, or the people them&s;elves. Our re|&s;earches into the moral or political cau&s;es of national pro&s;perity or decline, generally terminate there. Certain forms of govern|ment nece&s;&s;arily produce application, know|ledge, wi&s;dom, &s;ecurity, indu&s;try; and to the&s;e every thing is po&s;&s;ible. Around
<PB N="228" REF="234">
&s;ome of their towns, mo&s;t of the lands to a good di&s;tance are in &s;ome &s;ort of tillage, but they cannot afford to meliorate them, and mu&s;t prefer plowing up badly more fre&s;h land, to the labour and expence of improving the old. Both might be done under wi&s;e laws, and an equitable govern|ment; the proprietors living more on their e&s;tates, di&s;po&s;ing of them as they plea&s;ed, and &s;ufficiently intere&s;ted and &s;ecured in their produce and profits, the con&s;equent increa&s;e of population, would con&s;pire to overcome tho&s;e ob&s;tacles of nature, and to extend and improve all the arts connect|ed with the cultivation of the earth: the products would &s;oon increa&s;e; roads and canals might then be made by degrees: all the&s;e things would mutually a&s;&s;i&s;t each other; their &s;urplus would gradually find its way to di&s;tant markets, and new ones would appear at home.</P>

<P>THOUGH it is very uncommon to wi&s;h to go twice the &s;ame route in this country, yet, if you were to tempt me with the party you mention, I could per|haps bear to examine it better; though, like many others, I often find my&s;elf get|ting gradually more out of humour with it, and more doubtful if any thing can be learned from hence of u&s;e to mankind, unle&s;s it be that of &s;eeing and feeling, &s;o to &s;peak, more forcibly the numerous evil con&s;equences of fal&s;e policy, bad govern|ment, and a wor&s;e religion: le&s;&s;ons, to be &s;ure, of the utmo&s;t importance to mankind, or to nations, and which cannot be too &s;trongly enforced on them, if they could be taught to profit and take warning from the examples of their neighbours, and
<PB N="230" REF="236">
learn from the experience of each other. The errors of other nations are not un|known to us. They have been ob&s;erved and &s;tudied by &s;ome: but we &s;eem only thereby more habituated and reconciled to them; more inclined to imitate, and to follow, than to avoid their fall. We, in particular, &s;eem of late to be forgetting, that it is to the nature and form of our go|vernment we are indebted for our pre|eminence. The nations u&s;ed to &s;hew us to their tyrants and to their children, as &s;omething approaching to what a peo|ple and government ought to be; but we already begin to lo&s;e their re&s;pect and admiration. Since this mad and ruinous quarrel with our colonies, men &s;eem to examine and to doubt the ju&s;tice of your preten&s;ions to &s;uperiority in liberty, &s;en&s;e, &s;cience, genero&s;ity, &amp;c.; and &s;ee too clearly the tyranny and ab&s;urdity of any &s;overeignty or dominion of one people or nation over another.</P>
<P>The modern &s;y&s;tem of all-gra&s;ping com|merce and colonization, you know, I hold
<PB N="231" REF="237">
to be de&s;tructive in the end: and if, in &s;pite of the fatal examples of Spain and Portugal before our eyes, we &s;hould go on, and &s;ucceed in our wild and oppre&s;&s;ive en|terpri&s;es, of &s;ubduing and thence de&s;troy|ing tho&s;e American colonies, or undertake the endle&s;s expence of &s;ubjugating and maintaining a &s;et of &s;laves by way of cu&s;tomers, our future hi&s;tory and progre&s;s will probably re&s;emble that of the&s;e coun|tries; and if we were capable of taking and applying the examples, we could not find any better. Nay, if we retain only our A&s;iatic po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and turn our atten|tion and exertions to the Ea&s;t, proportioned to our &s;uppo&s;ed lo&s;&s;es in the We&s;t, endea|vouring there to extend our power in&s;tead of our trade; forgetting our own maxims of leaving commerce alone, to find its own proper channels, its level, and its limits; the con&s;equences may be equally fatal to us. The prize we &s;hall be tempted to pur|&s;ue there, is not probably of the right kind for us, being of too great a magnitude, and may become an object for ambition, enterpri&s;e, and extravagance, in&s;tead of
<PB N="232" REF="238">
furni&s;hing motives to that par&s;imonious in|du&s;try which belongs to commerce: it may have the &s;ame effects on us, as South America has had on Spain; deceiving the people as to real and u&s;eful riches: and the contagion may reach to government it&s;elf, and gradual|ly mi&s;lead and contaminate the whole nation.</P>
<P>Wherever there is a pro&s;pect of making fortunes &s;uddenly and without much trouble, that part will &s;oon be over&s;tocked, and the gradual and indu&s;trious, the only u&s;eful me|thod of acquiring wealth, will certainly be neglected. Hence depopulation and other numerous bad con&s;equences en&s;ue. Be&s;ides, it is to be feared, that a &s;et of merchants mu&s;t make but bad &s;overeigns, and then degene|rate as merchants. The two characters are probably incompatible, and mu&s;t mutually &s;poil each other. They will &s;oon begin to lo&s;e by their trade, and then try to re|cover them&s;elves by revenue and rapacity. Though our Ea&s;t India company has hitherto behaved much better in tho&s;e &s;itua|tions than could have been expected, yet I hope we may not wait for the final re&s;ult, to be convinced that the &s;y&s;tem is defective;
<PB N="233" REF="239">
that great companies and great conque&s;ts are generally real evils to a nation, and &s;hould never be admitted without ab&s;olute and obvious nece&s;&s;ity; and even then, their proper e&s;tabli&s;hment and control will require more wi&s;dom and virtue than can perhaps be expected in any govern|ment, or even in human nature.</P>
<P>If the nation &s;hould become intoxicated with the &s;pirit of conque&s;t as well as ra|pacity, and our executive government at home acquire the management of &s;uch productive &s;ources of wealth, and there|by get beyond the control of parlia|ment, and of every other control that can then be found, it may be tempt|ed and enabled to de&s;troy our con&s;ti|tution in effect, though the form &s;hould remain.</P>
<P>For any one country to govern another well at a di&s;tance, is perhaps impo&s;&s;ible: the few different modes that have been at|tempted, do not afford experience &s;uffici|ent to decide on the be&s;t, or on the practi|cability of any. Though we have &s;ucceeded
<PB N="234" REF="240">
better than other nations, in the in&s;tance of our American colonies, chiefly by giv|ing them our own con&s;titution, and by the free enjoyment of which we might &s;till have retained them; yet the &s;ame method will not probably an&s;wer for the Ea&s;t; and to attempt it by means of a company, can never, in my opinion, be the be&s;t way. A free and open trade, under a &s;trong and re&s;pectable military government, if the&s;e two are compatible, I &s;hould think the be&s;t mode; rai&s;ing the people who labour into more importance, by giving them better tenures of their lands, and &s;ome per&s;onal rights.&mdash;All this mu&s;t be done by a proper choice of per&s;ons, more than by laws and regulations from home. The warrior and the trader are characters more compatible, and might be made to agree better than the world ima|gine. Among military men, while bred up in the habits of oeconomy and the &s;trict notions of honour, you will have perhaps the be&s;t chance to find &s;ome of liberal and upright characters, fit for the highe&s;t offices of tru&s;t and control; e&s;pe|cially,
<PB N="235" REF="241">
if they them&s;elves are under &s;ome control, and obliged to acquire inform|ation: for you mu&s;t beware of the tyranny and the ignorance as yet too na|tural to the profe&s;&s;ion, till we adopt a pro|per military education.</P>
<P>If we examine hi&s;tory, we &s;hall find that no nation of the We&s;t was ever yet much connected with the Ea&s;t, without injury to them&s;elves, or could long retain the &s;ame character after, as before that con|nection. Of the great profits and for|tunes, which will ari&s;e more from re|venue and oppre&s;&s;ion than from fair com|merce, much will come home. It might be proper to trace, if we could, the probable effects of that influx; how far it may increa&s;e the demand for labour and indu&s;try, or have contrary effects, and tend to rai&s;e prices, to increa&s;e luxury too fa&s;t, bani&s;h manufactories to cheaper countries, and thence depopulate and weaken the nation. Mo&s;t of that which will be &s;pent on hor&s;es, &s;ervants, parks, table, loo&s;e women, &amp;c. will certainly act again&s;t indu&s;try, population, and
<PB N="236" REF="242">
national force; and with accelerating powers, by means of the en&s;uing change of manners and moral principles.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the fortunes &s;o em|ployed, may turn out to be a &s;mall part of the immen&s;e profits ari&s;ing from that trade, which may likewi&s;e employ many u&s;eful hands both a&s;hore and afloat, and &s;uch numbers of ve&s;&s;els. It would &s;eem, that a wi&s;e government might do &s;ome|thing towards dimini&s;hing the hurtful, and increa&s;ing the beneficial parts of that commerce and connection. If that trade &s;hould ever come to be laid open, whole|&s;ome competition may &s;tep in, to dimini&s;h profits, and render time and indu&s;try again more nece&s;&s;ary to the making of fortunes. Much will depend on the number and di&s;|po&s;ition of tho&s;e who come home with great riches; whether they injure or im|prove the country where they &s;ettle, by their A&s;iatic luxury; whether they can return to &s;upport, by their riches and example, all our old manners and politi|cal con&s;titution; or by laughing at both, and &s;haming liberty and oeconomy out of

countenance, &s;trengthen the growing party of the debauched and corrupted.</P>
<P>Should we not &s;ucceed again&s;t our colonies, and thence be forced to temper the extravagant ideas of our national power and glory, but be made to at|tend more to oeconomy, to our home and European commerce, wi&s;dom and moderation will be gained, and we may profit by the lo&s;s. We may be brought back to a better point of our national career than we were before, which was probably beyond the &s;ummit of power and pro&s;perity; and the&s;e were already leading us down the other &s;ide of the hill, through arts, luxury, and indul|gence. But if this is not found to be the con&s;equence of our lo&s;s, I &s;hall be inclined to fear that the blow will be too heavy, and the retrogradation too great to be reco|vered, and &s;hall dread the mi&s;chievous di&s;|&s;en&s;ions that u&s;ually attend on ill &s;ucce&s;s; hence weakne&s;s at home, and contempt from abroad, or ha&s;ty and inadequate re|medies wor&s;e than the di&s;orders.

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XXIV.</HI> Spani&s;h Improvements. Roads. Canals. People. Laws. Languor.</HEAD>
<P>WE &s;trangers and &s;ojourners here are very apt to think we could ea&s;ily improve this country. The fir&s;t &s;ight of it &s;ugge&s;ts the idea: and hence, perhaps, aro&s;e the proverbial &s;aying, <HI>Batir des cha|teaux en E&s;pagne.</HI> But from the little &s;uc|ce&s;s of all tho&s;e who have lately attempted it, we may pre&s;ume that it is ea&s;ier &s;aid than done. Various have been the pro|po&s;als and attempts to improve it during this reign and the la&s;t. Both monarchs have &s;et about it apparently in good earne&s;t and on good principles; but that is not enough. The be&s;t and true&s;t principles are not always applicable. The be&s;t of their plans, &s;uppo&s;ing them really in earne&s;t, mu&s;t always fail here in the execution. His pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty was right as to the ne|ce&s;&s;ity
<PB N="240" REF="246">
and the objects of reform, could he have found in his dominions enough of probity and practical abilities, riches and indu&s;try, to execute his intentions; but the&s;e were all wanting. He &s;aw that the country required public a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance and public works, before it could begin to be improved; as roads, canals, water. But it &s;eems none were found who knew how to begin or accompli&s;h tho&s;e improvements; none who could fore&s;ee that &s;uch things can be done here only upon a &s;mall &s;cale, and by &s;mall begin|nings, &s;uch as are within the ability of the country; and that they mu&s;t be contented with mediocrity, or le&s;s perhaps, for a long time yet to come. They will have every thing at once great and magnificent; hence they fail in all, and fini&s;h nothing. Indeed it is probable that &s;ome &s;ecret French coun&s;el is always at hand to lead them wrong.</P>
<P>No nation could more ea&s;ily have tole|rable roads acro&s;s their great dry plains; a very little labour at &s;ome places would make them pa&s;&s;able, and &s;ufficiently good
<PB N="241" REF="247">
for the country and its pre&s;ent commerce. But they have hardly any roads, becau&s;e they will have them better than ordinary, though there is &s;o little to carry, that they cannot prevent the gra&s;s growing in the little bits already made. This govern|ment has been planning roads for the&s;e twenty or thirty years pa&s;t, beginning and for&s;aking one impracticable project for another: too proud or jealous to imitate the wi&s;dom and oeconomy of the Ba&s;con|gada provinces, or to give them up to pro|vincial management, to the people who are more equal to the ta&s;k, and the mo&s;t concerned in the expence and execution. In all their plans they &s;eem to in&s;i&s;t on having them three times better and more expen&s;ive than nece&s;&s;ary. The five or &s;ix principal roads leading to the capital, can|not, at their rate, be fini&s;hed in le&s;s than fifty years, perhaps not in a hundred, and perhaps never. But in fifty years, the parts fir&s;t made will have fallen to ruins; for they make no provi&s;ion for repairs, nor could it be effectually appropriated if they did. Of the roads to the capital, the
<PB N="242" REF="248">
few leagues already executed have co&s;t nearly a million of reals <HI>per</HI> league. They &s;eem already to &s;top, probably unable to go on with the expence. Suppo&s;e the re&s;t to co&s;t only half a million <HI>per</HI> league, the five or &s;ix, of one hundred leagues each, will co&s;t three hundred millions. They can never probably afford five millions <HI>per annum,</HI> which makes it &s;ixty years to fini&s;h the&s;e few only. There are others equally nece&s;&s;ary; as likewi&s;e <HI>po&s;adas,</HI> or inns, for the accommodation of travellers; for if government will not build the&s;e, or encou|rage and a&s;&s;i&s;t in doing it, none el&s;e will.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t &s;ight, mo&s;t of this level country of Old Ca&s;tile &s;eems capable of canals as well as of roads, and that they might be fed by the different &s;treams that form the Douro. That river, as you may &s;ee by the map, receives the waters of a great extent of country, from all the &s;urrounding moun|tains of Ca&s;tile, Leon, A&s;turias, &amp;c. which inclo&s;e a very exten&s;ive valley. But an accurate knowledge of the country, of its produce and materials, would be nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="243" REF="249">
to determine the practicability of canals. I doubt they cannot &s;oon have any thing to carry that will pay the expence: &s;traw, though the mo&s;t likely to an&s;wer the pur|po&s;e, will yet be quite in&s;ufficient.</P>
<P>Such great public works, as before ob|&s;erved, would require a far greater degree of population and internal commerce; &s;omething to be carried of bulk and im|portance, of an increa&s;ing demand, &s;uf|ficient to pay the expence of making and repairs, which will both be great: and they have more roads and canals already planned and begun in Spain, than the mo&s;t populous and indu&s;trious nation could execute: &s;o little do they know their own &s;trength. It is from the great body of the people that all mu&s;t come, both the ex|pence and the labour: but they mu&s;t fir&s;t be taught to feel their own importance, and be &s;ure of the fruits of their indu&s;try, be|fore they will undertake any thing of con|&s;equence. They mu&s;t be in the habits of managing the affairs of their own little di&s;tricts: provincial and municipal bu&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="244" REF="250">
and juri&s;dictions &s;hould be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed and extended, in&s;tead of being gradually curtailed and taken away, as has been long the practice of their government, parti|cularly &s;ince the Bourbon acce&s;&s;ion. In|deed the privileges and importance of the people have of cour&s;e declined ever &s;ince their Cortes or Parliament was prevailed on to grant to Charles V. the &s;upplies be|fore the redre&s;s of grievances.</P>
<P>All &s;ocieties or governments are natu|rally &s;low and tedious in their progre&s;s, as if unwilling to change e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;toms, though ab&s;urd or pernicious; even de&s;poti&s;m her&s;elf can only go a certain pace; and as indolence often accompanies power, &s;he is frequently the &s;lowe&s;t of all. Many things might otherwi&s;e have been expected of this government, and they would, ere now, have got through the whole, and have taken away the old privileges of all the particular di&s;tricts and town&s;hips: but they have &s;till left &s;ome, as if to increa&s;e the confu&s;ion. There is more diver&s;ity of laws and cu&s;toms throughout this kingdom than
<PB N="245" REF="251">
even in France, or almo&s;t any other. Their different <HI>fueros, con&s;ejos, tribunales,</HI> are great plagues to them&s;elves, and to others who have any thing to do with them. But that is not the wor&s;t part of their juri&s;pru|dence; for it is perhaps proper, that law, in &s;ome ca&s;es, &s;hould co&s;t both trouble and expence. The great evil here is the want of ju&s;tice and of deci&s;ion: indeed there are &s;eldom any hopes of either: as they are only to be procured through an immen&s;ity of corruption and delay, all ideas of ju&s;tice, right, or recovery, are often given up, without attempting a redre&s;s or remedy by law, which, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, is known to be &s;o much wor&s;e than to &s;uffer the evil. So that it is difficult to conceive how &s;o many people of the law can live here. They mu&s;t, like the inn-keepers on their roads, proportionally fleece the few who fall into their hands.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, an eternal delay, languour, and indifference, as well as corruption, &s;eem to pervade every rank and every &s;pecies of bu&s;ine&s;s, and to have &s;eized the
<PB N="246" REF="252">
nation in general, and law and government mo&s;t of all. The con&s;equences, you will readily conceive, mu&s;t be, univer&s;al want of credit and confidence between man and man, and hence of commerce, indu&s;try, arts, &amp;c. Each mu&s;t live perpetually on his guard, as if &s;urrounded by enemies. Hence, in this &s;tate of &s;ociety, the value, the e&s;teem, and frequent u&s;e for private friend&s;hips, and the remarkable fidelity of &s;ome, for which, you know, this nation has long been renowned; and hence the frequent a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations, and other points of their manners and cu&s;toms, might be de|duced. But it is wonderful that the peo|ple in general are &s;o good as we find them to be; and we are led to re&s;pect the moral character that can refrain from &s;o much wickedne&s;s as might here be perpetrated with impunity.</P>
<P>You need not wonder at this extreme national depre&s;&s;ion, nor fancy the picture <HI>outr&egrave;.</HI> On clo&s;er examination, perhaps, we &s;hould find there were always more of tho&s;e defects in the character of their go|vernment,

particularly &s;ince they lo&s;t their Cortes, than could reach the page of the hi&s;torian, who &s;eldom gets at the bottom of things.

<OPENER><DATELINE>St. Jago.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WE find &s;omething like the old tolls and exactions of the feudal barons, &s;till exi&s;ting in &s;ome parts of the Spani&s;h monarchy. We came to an inn on the road belonging to the duke of Alva, and then to another belonging to the king, both let at a rack-rent &s;ix times above the real value. This rent, and &s;ome profit, mu&s;t be extorted from the few travellers that call there. One is apt to conclude, <HI>que le mal e&s;t &s;ans remede.</HI> Who can be expected to have any regard for the good of &s;ociety, if the fir&s;t characters in it can do the&s;e things?</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent prime mini&s;ter has, it &s;eems, undertaken the roads too; we &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee with what &s;ucce&s;s. He has already, as is
<PB N="249" REF="255">
u&s;ual here, rai&s;ed the public hopes too high. I hear he talks of depending partly on tolls, which will be di&s;tre&s;&s;ing and ineffectual, where there are few travellers, and &s;o little internal commerce: but, I think, he may probably have the &s;en&s;e to be contented with mediocrity, and may then &s;ucceed better than any of his predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>We now go on towards <HI>Toro</HI> and <HI>A&s;torga,</HI> and there approach another noble range of mountains, which turns to the &s;outh from tho&s;e of A&s;turias, and partly divide Galicia and Portugal from Spain. Here green hills, wood, water, popula|tion, and many beauties, again appear, and &s;eem doubly grateful to the &s;ight, &s;o long wearied with naked brown plains, and &s;ky.</P>
<P>Part of the&s;e fine mountains is inhabited by the <HI>Mauragatos,</HI> who are probably &s;ome remnant of a Moori&s;h or mixed race. They have retained a dre&s;s and manners different from the other Spaniards, but not any peculiar language, as I could learn. They are very indu&s;trious, and join the
<PB N="250" REF="256">
three different profe&s;&s;ions of farmer, car|rier, and merchant, which an&s;wers well enough for the rude &s;tate of &s;ociety in Spain. They execute all three with a more liberal &s;pirit, with more &s;kill and in|du&s;try, than u&s;ual in this country. Their numerous cattle an&s;wer very well for this treble purpo&s;e. Tolerable farmers, they have improved and beautified &s;everal parts of the&s;e mountains. Rich and adventur|ous merchants, they are in great reputation for probity and fair dealing, buying whole cargoes at Corun~a. They &s;till ob&s;tinately retain their ancient mean dre&s;s, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of &s;kins; and intermarry, I be|lieve, only with each other. They may increa&s;e, and may improve the country &s;till more, if they can e&s;cape oppre&s;&s;ion; but that is what cannot long be expected under this government, e&s;pecially if they appear to pro&s;per. Some of them &s;uffered by lending money to Philip V. Charles III. promi&s;ed, and began to pay it, but has &s;topped &s;hort at one-fifth of the debt.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="257">There are fine and &s;ingular &s;cenes and beauties of nature, in the&s;e we&s;tern moun|tains of Galicia: and they are tolerably peopled, though only by Gallegos, who are, to be &s;ure, but a poor mi&s;erable-look|ing race: docile, obedient, mean, and ragged creatures; &s;omething like the poor Jews at Gibraltar. In the&s;e northern pro|vinces, and in Catalonia, Spain might probably find coloni&s;ts enough for their mountainous and de&s;ert countries. Taking them by degrees, would not depopulate tho&s;e. Intermarrying and mixing different races, and modes of indu&s;try, might have &s;ome good effects. Here are &s;everal iron|works; and coal has been lately di&s;covered in the&s;e mountains, but they &s;ay it is not of a good kind: perhaps not till they get down to the next &s;tratum.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome tolerably good wines pro|duced on the internal hills of this range, as about Toro, &amp;c. Spain might have great variety of excellent wines. They are &s;urely improvable, being generally &s;trong, with a good body, and &s;ome have already a fine flavour: but ta&s;te depends
<PB N="252" REF="258">
much on habit. There is perhaps nothing the Spaniards could learn from their new friends the French, of more importance than the improvement of their wines, about which they are now as carele&s;s and indif|ferent as about every thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>Having returned by this road, and &s;een more of tho&s;e northern countries, I mu&s;t dwell a little longer on this kingdom of Galicia, as they &s;tyle it. I find it con&s;i&s;ts perhaps rather more of mountains than of plains or vales; yet almo&s;t all is culti|vated, or made &s;ome u&s;e of, though it might be of much more. Even in the wor&s;t parts we find timber, water, poor cattle, and &s;ome ragged people. It is a country fit to produce cattle and men; and for the&s;e two important objects, government &s;hould pro|mote and give up other con&s;iderations. They could perhaps double the number of their cattle, and improve the breed, only by cultivating gra&s;s and making hay. They might then &s;alt beef for the navy, and &s;end more cattle to Ca&s;tile. They would thus &s;oon increa&s;e their population, their milk, butter, chee&s;e, tallow, hides, candles,
<PB N="253" REF="259">
tanneries, timber, and workmen of various kinds.</P>
<P>There are wa&s;te lands &s;till in the central parts of this province. However, if the others were peopled and cultivated as this is, Spain would &s;till be a great nation. If the great proprietors could be made to live on their e&s;tates, to give long lea&s;es, or <HI>foros</HI> like the&s;e, and &s;ell them when they liked, it would probably improve and aggrandi&s;e the nation more than all their colonies and commerce.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t tru&s;t to my judgment, and other accidents, in &s;electing a few more of my de&s;ultory and unconnected memoran|dums; and fir&s;t &s;uch as occurred at St. Jago a &s;econd time. It is a&s;toni&s;hing how &s;o many rich churches and convents can be &s;upported in &s;uch a poor country: almo&s;t half the &s;ummer as yet con&s;i&s;ts of holidays, though &s;everal have been lately &s;truck out of the calendar.</P>
<P>We have had more things &s;tolen from us, and recovered &s;ome in the u&s;ual way,
<PB N="254" REF="260">
and have &s;een other indications of the im|po&s;&s;ibility of any police or ju&s;tice in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of this country. We have &s;een a large proportion of the few things recovered, go to the Confe&s;&s;or's convent for the merits of the di&s;covery.&mdash;Shocking bad travelling even in the be&s;t parts. Nei|ther roads, inns, nor tolerable workmen in any trade, to be found; but plenty of cu&s;tomhou&s;es, and their officers, every where, to torment every pa&s;&s;enger. And yet there is more &s;muggling in this coun|try than any where el&s;e. Many churches, and many beggars; the&s;e generally go to|gether.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tice, law, and every per&s;on thereunto belonging, are more dreaded than the thief or a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, who are far more favourite cha|racters with the populace in Spain; mur|derers and generally a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the people to e&s;cape. There is little or no police any where, except in &s;ome of their mercantile ports, and for which they are indebted to the &s;trangers and men of bu&s;ine&s;s there.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="261">The pilgrimage to St. Jago, though much dimini&s;hed, &s;till occa&s;ions great idle|ne&s;s and di&s;order during &s;ummer.

<P>There are many plea&s;ant green vallies, pretty well planted and cultivated, in the &s;outh parts of Galicia; but very dirty brown villages, built of clay or loo&s;e &s;tones, without lime, which is a great defect in this and &s;everal other parts of Spain.</P>
<P>Here, the riches of the clergy have &s;ome good effects. We meet with &s;ome gra&s;s lands, tolerable cattle, good bread, and fi&s;h markets, and a few country hou&s;es. The church, yet more powerful than the &s;tate, has detained &s;o much riches from the rapacity of government, and kept it in the country. The clergy, who will always live well, generally make a good market.
<PB N="256" REF="262">
But every public concern is &s;hamefully ne|glected except the church. Yet the famous cathedral here, is but a melancholy dungeon, with all its riches and ornaments. Even the Grecian orders of architecture add little beauty in the hands of negligent and un&s;kilful workmen. Their &s;treets and be&s;t buildings are mo&s;tly in a ruin|ous and dirty condition, and built in a barbarous ta&s;te. There is &s;ome good Gothic architecture in an ho&s;pital; and &s;ome good bold Doric about St. Martin's. But the be&s;t thing here is their church mu&s;ic, which is frequently very fine, both as to compo&s;ition and performance, by &s;ome good voices and in&s;trumental performers.</P>
<P>In this, and in all their other univer&s;ities, Newton, and modern philo&s;ophy, is &s;till prohibited. Nothing can &s;upplant Ari&s;totle, and the &s;uper&s;titious fathers and doctors of the church. Some young &s;tudents here narrowly e&s;caped the Inqui&s;ition by en|deavouring to procure lectures on experi|mental philo&s;ophy in the modern &s;tyle. But there was a ragged boy lately rai&s;ed to
<PB N="257" REF="263">
be a canon of the church by the king, for having &s;aved the ho&s;t or con&s;ecrated wafer from the fire, at the burning of a chapel.</P>
<P>You may have heard of the gradual de|cline of the different &s;ocieties in Spain for encouraging arts and trade, which had been e&s;tabli&s;hed in the pre&s;ent reign, with &s;uch &s;anguine hopes, by <HI>los amigos del pais.</HI> Such &s;ocieties have not had all the effects expected from them anywhere, and &s;till le&s;s in this country. It is plain, they have not been encouraged of late by go|vernment, notwith&s;tanding its early pro|fe&s;&s;ions of protection. Some of tho&s;e &s;o|cieties were in&s;tituted by good men, who are now mo&s;tly dead or di&s;graced, and the in&s;titutions follow the fate of their found|ers. The few that can barely be &s;aid to remain, through the influence of the clergy, who take the lead in every thing, are become the di&s;pen&s;ers of &s;mall pre|miums to little &s;choolma&s;ters for teaching little children their catechi&s;m. If the church mu&s;t direct the opinions of men, and go|vernment only their actions, it is ea&s;y to
<PB N="258" REF="264">
fore&s;ee which, in the end, mu&s;t govern. How can we &s;eparate things which nature has connected? We &s;hould perhaps except from this general &s;tate of decline, the Ba&s;|congada &s;ociety, where one liberal mind creates others, and as yet &s;upports his &s;o|ciety, and &s;ome of the u&s;eful arts, up to a kind of infant progre&s;s. Tho&s;e <HI>Bi&s;cainos</HI> wi&s;h for every kind of commerce and com|munication with the Engli&s;h, but it has been hitherto rendered impracticable by means of their clergy and their Bourbon government.

They are not now nearly &s;o well &s;upplied from Germany, Holland, and France, as they u&s;ed to be from England. This change in trade may be partly accounted for, from their &s;ecret Bourbon enmity and prohibi|tory laws; but we mu&s;t our&s;elves probably bear a &s;hare of the blame.

Better retain as many as po&s;&s;ible of tho&s;e le&s;&s;er component parts of trade in Engli&s;h hands: the retails cannot &s;o well be &s;uppli|ed by the &s;mall capitals, &s;kill, or the in|tere&s;ts of any people in the&s;e countries, though furni&s;hed by all the riders or com|mi&s;&s;ion-hunters you can ever &s;pare. Your merchants, both whole&s;ale and retail, though only the third or fourth cla&s;s as to importance in the &s;tate, are, however, ne|ce&s;&s;ary links in this chain, and mu&s;t come between the manufacturer and the &s;tranger. By &s;uch oeconomical attentions, Great Bri|tain and Ireland might yet &s;upply all Europe with &s;everal articles, better and cheaper than their re&s;pective nations ever

can. I would have at lea&s;t one Engli&s;h warehou&s;e, or &s;tore, &s;upported by our own &s;ubjects and capitals, in every great town in Europe. But nations, or rather their fooli&s;h governments, &s;eem daily more bent on &s;hutting each other out, and on ob|&s;tructing the communication and natural liberty of mankind throughout the world. The duties on Engli&s;h imports, in this and &s;everal other countries, I am told, amount often to thirty, and even forty <HI>per cent.</HI> which, if rigidly levied, would amount to a prohibition; towards which, indeed, our trade &s;eems here gradually approaching. This mi&s;taken commercial jealou&s;y and unnatural animo&s;ity &s;eems to go on increa&s;|ing; one fooli&s;h prohibition produces many more: nations retaliate their follies on each other; and we do not &s;ee where it all can end, unle&s;s in a &s;tate of perpetual warfare and barbari&s;m once more. May not we hope, in time, to &s;ee wi&s;e mini&s;ters teach|ing their nations to open their eyes to their own intere&s;t, and more liberally to open their trade to each other, and impart mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance, wealth, and indu&s;try?

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XXVI.</HI> The Penin&s;ula of Spain, and its Inhabitants.</HEAD>
<P>LET us look back, and take another cur&s;ory view of this penin&s;ula before we leave it. If we con&s;ider its &s;ituation, climate, &s;oil, coa&s;t, we mu&s;t &s;ee it is ca|pable of becoming one of the fir&s;t countries in the world, if properly governed; though in that ca&s;e it would perhaps be too power|ful, and might domineer and govern all the re&s;t. Its plains and its mountains, its &s;urface and its mines, might again be made to produce mo&s;t of the things wanted by man, and provide a &s;ufficient overplus to purcha&s;e the re&s;t, which is perhaps better than po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing all. Though its interior provinces contain much dry and barren land, and do not communicate well with the &s;ea, nor with one another, tho&s;e impe|diments of nature, though now increa&s;ed or neglected, might be partly overcome or
<PB N="263" REF="269">
mitigated. Though its rivers do not all carry the advantages of internal navigation far into the country, being ob&s;tructed by currents and falls, as u&s;ual in their pa&s;&s;age through the mountains, &s;ome of them are navigable a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, and might be extended. It has been thought, that Old Ca&s;tile might be made to communicate by canals with the Minho, towards &s;ome of its &s;ources, and thence with the &s;ea; and likewi&s;e through &s;ome vallies of the northern range of mountains, near St. Ander, or Villavicio&s;a; and New Ca&s;tile, with the Guadalquivir, through &s;ome part of Sierra Morena; likewi&s;e New Ca&s;tile, E&s;trema|dura, &amp;c. by means of the Tagus and Guadiana, might perhaps in time be con|nected with the &s;ea. A great part of Ara|gon might be made to communicate with the Mediterranean, and inland places with each other, by means of the Ebro; and much of Andalu&s;ia by the Guadalquivir. The&s;e points are highly worthy the atten|tion of Spain, and of being well examined by men of real &s;cience and local know|ledge, and not merely by French quacks.
<PB N="264" REF="270">
Though they cannot now think of execut|ing &s;uch projects, with their pre&s;ent degree of population and kind of government, the very idea might help to improve both. Though it &s;hould be doubted if the Gua|diana, the Tagus, the Douro, or the Minho, could be made to carry to the &s;ea the produce of the provinces of Spain through which they pa&s;s, they might, in &s;ome parts, furni&s;h the means of internal communication, and of watering the coun|try. The&s;e rivers are of e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to Portugal, and might be made to render &s;till more. Commerce, indu&s;try, and a high population, can do wonders in &s;uch works. In &s;ome parts of Portugal, &s;mall channels have already been carried far along the hills for watering the lower country: perhaps &s;ome of the&s;e might be enlarged, &s;o as to form canals, and join the great rivers for inland navigation. The &s;ame might pro|bably be done with tho&s;e we &s;ee cut for mill-&s;treams in the high banks or precipices along tho&s;e rivers, as they pa&s;s the high country. In this &s;mall way, &s;ome begin|nings might even now be made.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="271">You may have heard of the principal canals projected and begun in Spain having already failed in the execution, and in their funds: &s;ome, from the mi&s;manage|ment of French quack engineers, numbers of &s;uch being always ready here to under|take every thing. The Dutch and other &s;ub&s;cribers to the&s;e canals mu&s;t probably lo&s;e their capital; and the intere&s;t, a burden on the king, cannot be very &s;ecure beyond the pre&s;ent reign. We &s;aw, the year be|fore la&s;t, the beginning of a canal near Palencia in Old Ca&s;tile: but there mu&s;t yet be &s;o little there to be carried on it, only &s;ome &s;traw and corn, that I can ea&s;ily be|lieve it mu&s;t be given up, or left unfini&s;hed, as I then foretold. The Murcia canal, I hear, was found to have too little water in &s;ummer, and in winter too much. I have not heard what made them give up that at Zaragoza. Their hopes of watering any con&s;iderable extent of country by that means, mu&s;t fail, from the &s;carcity of water when mo&s;t wanted, and their un&s;kilful methods of &s;upplying it. All the&s;e canal &s;chemes, begun upon too great a &s;cale for
<PB N="266" REF="272">
the country, had always, to me, too much the appearance of <HI>bubbles</HI> and deception; as yet impracticable and inadequate both as to the means and the objects. They never will under&s;tand gradation and mode|ration in their public &s;chemes.</P>
<P>Of the inhabitants of this country let us al&s;o take another &s;light view. Notwith|&s;tanding the naked, brown, and mi&s;erable look of the&s;e great plains, e&s;pecially dur|ing &s;ummer, yet animal life, in general, is perhaps of a character capable of more vigour and energy, than on the other &s;ide of the Pyrenees, when not depre&s;&s;ed by want, indolence, or oppre&s;&s;ion, which is, however, too often the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Their &s;traw and barley are probably as hearty food for cattle as our hay and corn. Though the country produces few of the comforts of life, the&s;e few are good of their kind. Though the&s;e arid wa&s;tes may &s;trike us at fir&s;t with a kind of horror, yet when we perceive that they produce &s;uch good wine, corn, &s;traw, and cattle, though in quantities comparatively &s;mall, we are
<PB N="267" REF="273">
gradually more reconciled even to the ap|pearance of the country, and might pro|bably, by habit, be brought to like it as well as the natives, and might learn, like them, to enjoy ba&s;king and &s;leeping on du&s;t in&s;tead of gra&s;s.</P>
<P>I think the Spaniards are naturally a bold, a cool, a &s;pirited, and clear-headed race of people: and I &s;ee nothing in their original character very incompatible with the progre&s;s of indu&s;try and improvement, which el&s;ewhere &s;eems natural to men in &s;ociety. They are &s;till capable of great activity on certain occa&s;ions, though per|haps generally aver&s;e to continued la|bour. However, I have ob&s;erved that &s;ome of their trade&s;men, as &s;miths, muleteers, and others, labour hard and with continu|ance; and we &s;hould think that others might be induced to do the &s;ame, by equal motives. Their &s;oldiers, bull-fighters, me&s;|&s;engers, are capable of great efforts oc|ca&s;ionally. Though the motives of nece&s;&s;ity are not &s;o powerful in warm climates as in cold; as the former relax and debilitate the
<PB N="268" REF="274">
human frame, dimini&s;h the nece&s;&s;ity to labour, with the number of our wants, and more ea&s;ily &s;upply the remainder; yet we know that human arts and indu&s;try have been planted and have pro&s;pered in almo&s;t all climates; and hence it appears, that there are moral motives to be found &s;uf|ficient to overcome mo&s;t of the impedi|ments of nature.</P>
<P>All this leads to the u&s;ual text and con|clu&s;ion,&mdash;That the&s;e people might again exert them&s;elves, and emerge from their pre&s;ent poverty, indolence, and political in&s;ignificance, if they were properly go|verned. But any reform is now become very improbable: not many of them can even be convinced that it is nece&s;&s;ary, nor be made thoroughly &s;en&s;ible of their fall, and are &s;till farther from the principles on which their recovery depends. I think they may long remain nearly as they are, a &s;tanding le&s;&s;on for other nations; more &s;ubject, from various accidents, to decline &s;till farther, than with any rea&s;onable hopes ever to ri&s;e again to their former character and eminence.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="275">The mo&s;t intere&s;ting parts of their hi&s;tory, the cau&s;es of their decline, have been often inve&s;tigated, even before Monte&s;quieu di&s;|played them in his conci&s;e and demon&s;tra|tive manner. I think their pre&s;ent wretch|ed government and religion have had the greate&s;t &s;hare in producing their pre&s;ent character, and in ha&s;tening their downfal; perhaps we might trace the cau&s;es to that which gave them fir&s;t too much of the religious, and then of the military, &s;pirit; and hence that of conque&s;t which, by &s;uc|ce&s;s, is naturally turned into rapacity, cruelty, and plunder, and at la&s;t exhau&s;t|ing it&s;elf, dies by indulgence, like every other extreme of human pa&s;&s;ions and pur|&s;uits, leaving only the <HI>caput mortuum</HI> of the human character, which is here indolence and indifference, mixed up with pride and devotion.</P>
<P>Their colonies have not, I think, as you &s;uppo&s;e, depopulated Spain by emigration, &s;o much as by turning the attention of the people from home to di&s;tant objects; from u&s;eful arts and indu&s;try, to a di&s;po&s;ition for
<PB N="270" REF="276">
enterpri&s;e and adventure, and all the idle|ne&s;s of running after good luck; but a wi&s;e government at home would &s;oon have repleni&s;hed all the emigrations. At a period of religious and military ardour, already carried too far, a great object for both is di&s;covered, which carries them &s;till farther. From thence it is ea&s;y to trace the progre&s;s and effects of their mi&s;taken ideas of riches, of their idlene&s;s and gradual decay. Their mo&s;t pernicious emigration was, doubtle&s;s, the expul&s;ion of the Moors and Jews by Philip II. and III., as they carried away &s;o many u&s;eful hands and &s;ome entire trades. But that was only one of the nu|merous bad con&s;equences of their broken government and fanatical religion, the primary &s;ources of &s;o many evils, and which may yet go on, for ages to come, to produce many more. Their religious pre|judices are probably the mo&s;t powerful cau&s;e of their depre&s;&s;ion, and have more exten&s;ive con&s;equences than is generally imagined. Few &s;ubjects e&s;cape their in|fluence: like a contagious poi&s;on, they &s;pread through, and contaminate all that
<PB N="271" REF="277">
concerns mankind, rai&s;e &s;ome unexpected barrier again&s;t every alteration of import|ance, and keep them at enmity with half the world, and its improvements.</P>
<P>We know that a change of &s;ituation will often change the characters of men: and that the wor&s;t of our &s;ubjects have &s;ome|times been reformed, when tran&s;ported to our colonies. A di&s;tance from home, new occupations, even a cro&s;&s;ing the line, has often been ob&s;erved to produce &s;ome change in men's moral ideas, and to cancel &s;ome di&s;tinctions of conventional behaviour. A &s;hipwreck, or any extreme common dan|ger, pre&s;ently levels all ranks and di&s;tinc|tions. Hence it is obvious, that the go|vernment that could create circum&s;tances and occa&s;ions, that could direct education and manners, might give men &s;uch habits, and make of them what they plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>But it would be like working without materials, to attempt making a people great, without great objects and motives to exer|tion both at home and abroad. Though this nation has probably been generally
<PB N="272" REF="278">
&s;omewhat over-rated or mi&s;taken, and from &s;ituation been little known, and of a character &s;o re&s;pectable, and proper to &s;avour the impo&s;ition; yet we know they once &s;tood much higher than at pre&s;ent, and produced men of characters to be admir|ed and imitated: but that was when they had grand national views and objects of employ, and con&s;tant intercour&s;e with Flanders, Germany, Italy; from which aro&s;e various incitements to exertions in arms, letters, indu&s;try. With a warm emulation, they then followed clo&s;e, and tried to keep pace with Italy in learning and ta&s;te: and in arms they led the way, and gave law to Europe. But when they cea&s;ed to contend and to act with their equals and neighbours, from being exhau&s;t|ed, they became &s;till more incapable of it by di&s;u&s;e: and &s;ince they &s;hrunk within th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m&s;elves, and from fal&s;e and impracti|cable ideas of independence on other na|tions, were engro&s;&s;ed by their wa&s;ting colonies, they have dwindled away to what we &s;ee; have &s;unk into apathy and idle|ne&s;s, and have become, of cour&s;e, unfit
<PB N="273" REF="279">
for all tho&s;e things in which they have not been employed; and now under a govern|ment, that probably from policy keeps them down, and holds them at a di&s;tance from their own national affairs, there they mu&s;t probably long remain.</P>
<P>We may often find &s;omething in the na|ture of a country that will account for many parts of the hi&s;tory and character of the people. Even the geographical &s;tation, independent of climate, may have a de|cided influence on national di&s;po&s;itions and events. From our in&s;ular po&s;ition may proceed much of our character and govern|ment. The &s;eparate &s;ituation of this pe|nin&s;ula may have contributed to &s;ugge&s;t, and to indulge their ideas and habits of pride and indolence, and of a &s;eparate and independent manner of political exi&s;tence. But for this the country is perhaps le&s;s adapted than mo&s;t others; con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of a few large arid plains, and ranges of mountains, which communicate badly with each other, and which were never probably internally commercial,
<PB N="274" REF="280">
well calculated for mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance, nor very well peopled; nor productive, except upon their few rivers. Thence might be traced &s;ome of the cau&s;es of their internal divi&s;ions; of their frequent decline, and of their falling &s;o often into a dependence on other nations, as we &s;ee in their hi&s;tory; &s;ucce&s;&s;ively on Phenicians, Carthaginians, Romans, Goths, Saracens, and now on the French.</P>
<P>To keep &s;uch a people up to all the energy of character and activity of indu&s;try, requi&s;ite to its being a great and indepen|dent nation, and to pre&s;erve it in a &s;tate of cultivation, every human motive to exertion is probably nece&s;&s;ary. Without freedom and &s;ecurity, arts and commerce, and a con&s;tant intercour&s;e and competition with other countries, we cannot expect them to ri&s;e, by any means within the powers or nature of their pre&s;ent govern|ment, near to their former &s;tate of great|ne&s;s. Without freedom and good govern|ment, foreign wars and commerce, even our own i&s;land would probably &s;oon revert
<PB N="275" REF="281">
to its former barbarity and political in&s;igni|ficance. You know how improbable and impracticable I think their recovery, and I have perhaps already enumerated rea&s;ons enough for that opinion; but you mu&s;t have them as they occur. Any one who knows the people of Spain will readily con|ceive how very unequal the pre&s;ent race would be to execute the functions, to a&s;&s;ert or maintain the rights, of their former con&s;titution of government. When peo|ple arrive at certain degrees of &s;loth and indifference, it becomes doubly difficult to find motives that have any influence with them. How can we teach him who will not learn; or improve tho&s;e who&s;e ta&s;te and judgment, natural and moral, are &s;o vitiated as to have rever&s;ed the order of nature? where &s;ome of the mo&s;t u&s;eful occupations of men are di&s;graceful, while that of begging, and even of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, are not &s;o? where they have lo&s;t their reli&s;h for the beauties of nature, and for the comforts of life, many preferring dirt to cleanline&s;s, and indolence with want to indu&s;try with all its comforts and conveni|encies;
<PB N="276" REF="282">
where mo&s;t of the country peo|ple hate the &s;ight of trees, and have a di&s;like to milk, greens, and the other &s;imple and original kinds of food, their palates being &s;poiled by indulging the facti|tious ta&s;te for garlick, onions, peppers, and high &s;ea&s;onings. Man is the creature of habit. When, from want, oppre&s;&s;ion, or indulgence, he abandons, or gets beyond the fir&s;t &s;imple feelings or in&s;tincts of na|ture, there &s;eem no natural bounds or limits left to &s;top his gradually de&s;troying his &s;en&s;es, his mind, and his whole &s;elf. He may then go on, till he learn to drink alkohol, to eat a&s;&s;afoetida, or do mi&s;chief, for plea&s;ure, till the whole animal is &s;poiled or annihilated.</P>
<P>The great object of de&s;ire &s;eems here a long and lazy life; whereas the &s;hort and active has generally been of mo&s;t &s;er|vice to mankind, and more &s;uited to &s;ociety. We may in&s;tance Alexander, Raphael, and many others. If the youth, at lea&s;t, of a country cannot be made to love activity and danger, I fear there is &s;mall hope of that country. Hardly any thing &s;eems now
<PB N="277" REF="283">
capable of exciting this people to great ef|forts, except their &s;uper&s;titious terrors, love, revenge, or a fandango. You are aware that we mu&s;t not conclude all are &s;o far &s;unk in indolence and indifference; but I fear this character is general enough to con&s;ider the others as exceptions. To &s;uch a &s;tate has a bad government reduced the fir&s;t people in Europe.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVII. <HI>On Government.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD>To Mr. A. J.</HEAD>
<P>I DO not di&s;approve of your indulging a little in &s;peculations upon government and politics; it may induce you to go on with hi&s;tory, law, travel, &amp;c. all which lead to other u&s;eful re&s;earches. The utility of my letters and opinions will con&s;i&s;t, I hope, more in the efforts of thought and re&s;earch they may produce in you, than in the actual information they may contain. Nor do I wi&s;h to di&s;courage your di&s;po&s;ition to perpetual reform and improvement, which is natural to young and ardent minds; the world will &s;oon enough repre&s;s that zeal. I agree with you, that the art of government has long been &s;tationary, and perhaps often retro|grade, and might have been expected to
<PB N="279" REF="285">
be much farther advanced than we find it. When we con&s;ider the progre&s;s it once made among the Greeks, we cannot ea&s;ily account for its &s;ub&s;equent decline. With|out being too &s;anguine or romantic, we may be permitted to hope for degrees of politi|cal &s;kill and wi&s;dom, and for &s;ome future lawgiver, more perfect than any that have been yet &s;een in the world. May we not expect, that this great art will now advance in an accelerated progre&s;&s;ion, by means of England, and Engli&s;h America? We may now look for &s;ome &s;y&s;tem that &s;hall com|prehend at once the principles of duration and improvement, &s;o as to keep pace with the other arts. The be&s;t &s;y&s;tems of govern|ment hitherto known have been like the machines that require to be wound up at certain periods: every revolution con|tains the &s;eeds of others. We ought to look well into hi&s;tory, and &s;ee if we &s;hould not fir&s;t try to equal &s;ome of the ancient governments, before we pretend to &s;urpa&s;s them. Some allege we cannot go much farther. The mo&s;t perfect &s;y&s;tem would doubtle&s;s, in the execution, &s;till
<PB N="280" REF="286">
&s;avour of the imperfection of man, &s;o weak a being, and &s;o ea&s;ily &s;poiled by power, or any other indulgence. By perfection mu&s;t be under&s;tood the be&s;t po&s;&s;i|ble &s;y&s;tem for man, with all his defects; and I think we have not yet di&s;covered on what it depends: the di&s;covery may require more ages of experience, and be found very &s;imple at la&s;t.</P>
<P>I am inclined to believe the mo&s;t perfect &s;y&s;tem may be found to depend chiefly on three points: 1. On good education; 2. Equal repre&s;entation; and 3. Mutual control. We have, in England, &s;uc|ceeded tolerably well in the third of the&s;e, though not &s;o well in the two former. But every man who thinks, mu&s;t have his own &s;y&s;tem, and we can &s;eldom agree; a nece&s;&s;ary evil, perhaps the mo&s;t difficult of all to be remedied. However, to fill up part of my &s;y&s;tem, and e&s;tabli&s;h a government that &s;hould improve, in&s;tead of declining as u&s;ual, I think the following conditions nece&s;&s;ary. 1. A &s;ecurity in the form of con&s;titution, that every law will
<PB N="281" REF="287">
be the real &s;entiment of a majority of the whole community, and not of a &s;mall part only. 2. I mu&s;t have a proper di&s;tribu|tion of power among per&s;ons and corporate bodies, &s;o that they may all both a&s;&s;i&s;t and control each other; &s;ome of them change|able, and others fixed, with right rotation for the fir&s;t, and proper limitations for both. In this di&s;tribution may con&s;i&s;t the &s;ecret of the whole &s;cience of legi&s;lation. A right divi&s;ion of the public labour, be|tween corporate bodies and individuals, and which &s;hould bring all the powers of both &s;exes into action, might go farther than we can now even imagine. Society &s;eems to fall almo&s;t naturally into a divi&s;ion of three cla&s;&s;es; a fir&s;t, middle, and lower; and hence the legi&s;lature, almo&s;t as na|turally, into tho&s;e of a monarch, a &s;enate, and commons by repre&s;entation: three powers, at lea&s;t, being nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve a balance by mutual control. This once e&s;tabli&s;hed, all the re&s;t, as wi&s;dom, know|ledge, virtue, &s;eem to &s;low from it in cour&s;e: public and private life, govern|ment and education, will then form but
<PB N="282" REF="288">
one great &s;chool, and will all equally con|tribute to produce the kinds of merit the mo&s;t wanted: fixed and temporary laws will be well di&s;tingui&s;hed: in &s;hort, the re&s;ult of all the be&s;t &s;peculations and theories upon go|vernment &s;eems to demon&s;trate our own to be the neare&s;t perfection; and perhaps we have only to remove the defects above mentioned, in education and repre&s;entation, in order to form the be&s;t government po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>There will then probably be wi&s;dom enough to render the education of all ranks &s;omewhat military; this I think indi&s;pen&s;|able, and believe that no government can be la&s;ting where the people have lo&s;t the u&s;e of arms. While they retain their martial habits, it may indeed require more judg|ment and attention to direct them, than mo&s;t governments are able or willing to be&s;tow, until they &s;hall become better con&s;titut|ed, &s;o as to produce the nece&s;&s;ary &s;kill, zeal, and a&s;&s;iduity; then the ta&s;k becomes ea&s;y.

<P>Since the great improvements and di|vi&s;ion of arts and labour, and their en|gro&s;&s;ing the whole time and attention of the workmen, the people in mo&s;t countries have readily agreed to be taxed in order to pay for their defence, in preference to the privilege of defending them&s;elves: they thereby gave up, at once, all their remain|ing &s;ecurity in any rights, civil or political, which will be gradually infringed by their rulers, who are no longer under the con&s;tant nece&s;&s;ity of attending to the in|tere&s;ts of a people without property or military talents, and hence without influ|ence. Such governments will degenerate into de&s;poti&s;m, then in&s;en&s;ibly decline, and at la&s;t fall a prey to the fir&s;t free and warlike nation that may attack them in a
<PB N="284" REF="290">
few &s;ucce&s;&s;ive wars: &s;uch &s;eems to be the circle of our policy, arts, commerce, and, in &s;hort, of human nature. Your remedy of repre&s;entation came in good time to keep up, or rather rai&s;e, for a time the import|ance of the people; but to &s;upport it, will require more arrangements civil and mili|tary. Let us hope the martial &s;pirit will &s;pread and take root among us, and that a general circulating militia, in which all &s;erve in their turn, will at length be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, &s;o as to &s;upply a &s;mall but well-di&s;ciplined army, and render the people more military and more orderly.</P>
<P>Since you lead me into the&s;e matters, I know not how to leave them, though I wi&s;h to be conci&s;e. I think we are more readily inclined to reflect and talk upon government in the countries where it is wor&s;t; and this country affords a variety of &s;ubjects for &s;uch reflections. To make the indolent become active and indu&s;trious, I think their wants mu&s;t be increa&s;ed. In the fine&s;t countries and climates, &s;uch as this of Spain, where their wants are few, and tho&s;e few ea&s;ily &s;upplied, we find the
<PB N="285" REF="291">
inhabitants the mo&s;t helple&s;s and inactive. Kingdoms, however, &s;eem equally doom|ed to peri&s;h by the oppo&s;ite progre&s;&s;ion, fir&s;t of an indu&s;trious, and then a rapacious avarice. When the love of riches has been once awakened, and &s;ufficiently exerci&s;ed, it &s;hould be re&s;trained and regulated, and on the wi&s;dom of &s;uch regulations much of the pro&s;perity and duration of empires will depend. But modern govern|ments, on the contrary, our own not ex|cepted, are building on the foundation of pecuniary intere&s;t an immen&s;e and in|crea&s;ing &s;tructure, which at la&s;t may fall by its own weight, like that of Spain. We feed and encourage, in&s;tead of mi|tigating and diverting, the love of power and of riches, till they become enormous and uncontrolable. Though in &s;ome countries merit may by &s;tealth creep into notice and power, it mu&s;t in time be entirely &s;acrificed to riches. The ea&s;y alienation and circulation of great fortunes, and the proper divi&s;ion of large e&s;tates, are almo&s;t everywhere impeded, and the accumulation of them promoted, by
<PB N="286" REF="292">
partial and pernicious laws and cu&s;toms. This is remarkably the ca&s;e here, where a few grandees may, in time, engro&s;s all the great titles and e&s;tates of the kingdom: the duke of Alva already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es eleven dukedoms (<HI>&s;ombreros</HI> or <HI>grandezas</HI>); the duke of Medina Caeli, the Conde de Altamira, &amp;c. have each acquired &s;everal by inheritance. Through mo&s;t part of Europe property &s;eems to be getting into fewer hands, and thence more within the reach of government, which is con&s;equently the more inclined and enabled to become de|&s;potic, by combinations of the few again&s;t the many. There have been variations in this progre&s;&s;ion, according as chance or wi&s;|dom have directed: human knowledge and fore&s;ight may, in &s;ome ca&s;es, have had an influence on the duration and pro&s;perity of empires. In a general tendency towards oppre&s;&s;ion, though the people have often po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the bare nece&s;&s;aries of life on no better tenure than &s;o far as they could be u&s;eful to their oppre&s;&s;ors, that tenure has gradually become, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, a tolerably good one. Luxury, by creating
<PB N="287" REF="293">
wants, has increa&s;ed the demand for the labour and ingenuity of the people: it has tempted the rich to &s;pend and to &s;ell their e&s;tates, and enabled the indu&s;trious to buy them, promoting a better divi&s;ion and circulation of property. As far as tho&s;e people have been able to protect and pre|&s;erve their indu&s;try and their influence, by a proper temperament of freedom and &s;ecurity, by a wi&s;e and well-balanced con|&s;titution of government, &s;o far the &s;uperior fruits of their indu&s;try have appeared, increa&s;ed, and produced a &s;pirit of &s;ome independence for its own &s;upport. This may be called the pur&s;e-proud &s;pirit of commerce and riches; it may give ri&s;e to improvements yet un&s;een, and continue to &s;well till it bur&s;t, and &s;hare the fate of all human pur&s;uits when not &s;ufficiently kept within bounds. We do not indeed &s;eem clearly to have determined the merits and effects of this modern &s;y&s;tem of indu&s;try and avarice, nor to have mea&s;ured or com|pared it with that of the ancient &s;pirit of poverty, independence, and vigour of mind: men of books admire the latter, men of
<PB N="288" REF="294">
the world the former, and each laughs at the other. Though this modern &s;pirit of arts and commerce &s;eems capable of &s;upplying the place of every thing, and almo&s;t of virtue it&s;elf, we may however be permitted to doubt of its omnipotence whenever it &s;hall have the other to contend with. It was fore&s;een, that Carthage, with all its riches and mercenary armies, mu&s;t at length be overcome by the &s;pirit and per&s;everance of the Roman republic. The arts and &s;ciences cannot gain a &s;ituation that will en&s;ure their own exi&s;tence and duration, till the art of government &s;hall have made a pro|gre&s;s equal to the re&s;t. The force of modern European nations is now comput|ed by pounds, &s;hillings, and pence; and in their contentions the riche&s;t generally prevail: but this may not always be the ca&s;e. Were it not for the art of for|tification, even now an army of Tartar hor&s;e, directed by a Tamerlane or an Alexander, might, by repeated attempts, reduce Europe once more to a barbarous de&s;ert, and bury all her arts and im|provements in oblivion. After a certain
<PB N="289" REF="295">
progre&s;s of tyranny, and the divi&s;ion of the world again among a few overgrown and ignorant tyrants, it may require only the caprice or mi&s;take of &s;ome one of them, to prepare Europe for &s;uch an event; while the &s;cience and wi&s;dom, the virtue and intere&s;t, of all the re&s;t of man|kind remain without power or influence. The carrying any &s;pecious &s;y&s;tem of policy to an extreme, &s;uch as the di&s;u&s;e of forti|fications and of militias, may be &s;ufficient to prevent or impede the efficacy of your &s;uperior arts and &s;trength, and at once lay you open to &s;uch a di&s;a&s;ter.</P>
<P>I do not mean to repre&s;ent the people in France or Spain, as in much danger from the &s;pirit of commerce and luxury: bene|volence would wi&s;h they were: they are probably pa&s;t that period, and incapable, without more property and arrangement, of recovering their influence. In the&s;e governments, democracy mu&s;t now be out of the que&s;tion, and the future con|tentions will only be between the monarchic and ari&s;tocratic oppre&s;&s;ors. The poverty and dependence of the people are every|where
<PB N="290" REF="296">
too evident: their dangers and de|pre&s;&s;ion proceed more from feudal tyranny than commercial luxury. You know the powers and oppre&s;&s;ive privileges of their nobility and clergy, though the latter are con&s;idered as pretty good landlords: that their e&s;tates do not improve &s;o much as they ought, is perhaps more owing to their being too indulgent than too rigid ma&s;ters, and to their being only proprietors for life.</P>
<P>Some laws, like tho&s;e in Holland and el&s;ewhere, that promote the divi&s;ion of great e&s;tates, and facilitate this alienation, if they could be generally adopted, might obviate the dangers of tho&s;e too great accumula|tions and inequalities, without checking too much of that pa&s;&s;ion for riches, and the family pride, which &s;ometimes pro|duce beneficial effects. Such laws might help to &s;ave Europe from tho&s;e misfortunes which we have pre&s;umed to fore&s;ee.</P>

<P>MANY clear-headed &s;en&s;ible men we meet with in this country belong to the law; that profe&s;&s;ion &s;eems to produce the mo&s;t freedom, learning, eloquence, and the kind of knowledge chiefly wanted in this nation. From &s;ome of the&s;e, you will meet with more &s;ati&s;|factory information concerning the actual &s;tate of their government and con&s;titution, than you can acquire from any books; yet it may be proper to draw from both &s;ources. Though &s;uch men cannot now be of much &s;ervice to a nation where both church and &s;tate are again&s;t every reform

or advancement, at &s;ome future period they may, if &s;ufficiently hone&s;t and numerous, be of infinite u&s;e to it. Nor do I think this nation &s;o thoroughly incapable of re|form as the French. If they can once be moved to &s;et about a revolution upon &s;y&s;tem, they will be found more equal to the ta&s;k. There may be &s;ome hope in the tyranny and ab&s;urdity of their govern|ment: the&s;e being carried to extremes in enlightened times, may create &s;ome regu|lated re&s;i&s;tance, as formerly in Flanders, and as was lately very nearly the ca&s;e at Madrid; and this might grow into a &s;y&s;te|matic oppo&s;ition, and produce a balanced government as in England. Unlimited power mu&s;t, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, at length go ir|recoverably wrong, and may then &s;trangle her&s;elf in her own ignorance and ab&s;urdi|ties: &s;uch may be the fate of this, as well as of Papal and Mahomedan powers. And then it becomes of the la&s;t importance to have a &s;ufficient number of wi&s;e men ready with the remedy, to act with coolne&s;s on a pre-concerted plan, and to e&s;tabli&s;h a con&s;ti|tution that &s;hall balance, &s;upport, and im|prove

it&s;elf. However, their ancient mode of government, its revolutions and decline, you are certainly right to inve&s;tigate from their hi&s;tory; and we may procure you the acquaintance of &s;ome who can &s;horten and direct your labour. I believe you will find their con&s;titution, even at its be&s;t periods, to have been full of faults; the legi&s;lature, or <HI>Cortes,</HI> generally inadequate to the framing of good laws, that &s;hould include the intere&s;ts of all ranks; the&s;e being mo&s;tly dictated by the crown or the nobles, amid&s;t the perpetual conte&s;ts, and without any certain balance, between tho&s;e two powers; the third and mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential power, the people, never having been well repre|&s;ented, united and con&s;tituted into an in|dependent member of the legi&s;lature: their modes of proceeding were never, I believe, very good, nor &s;ufficiently &s;ettled and re|gular. It &s;eems to have been an accidental and unfini&s;hed &s;y&s;tem, with the kinds and degrees of liberty more productive of an|archy than of wi&s;dom or &s;teady exertion. However it might have been improved, if it had la&s;ted, and had not, like mo&s;t other
<PB N="294" REF="300">
old Gothic governments, begun to decline and to vani&s;h, before they knew well what it was, or might become. A con&s;titution framed in rude and warlike times, imped|ed in the progre&s;&s;ive changes nece&s;&s;ary to make it keep pace with tho&s;e of manners, opinions, and property, became gradually quite unfit to contend with the effects of luxury and partial intere&s;ts; and tyranny, in new &s;hapes, advanced fa&s;ter than politi|cal knowledge and precaution, which often come too late.</P>
<P>You will find, that their wi&s;e&s;t and greate&s;t monarchs were tho&s;e who protected the people, and depre&s;&s;ed the nobles, the mo&s;t; taking care to have always the lower and mo&s;t numerous cla&s;&s;es on their &s;ide: &s;uch were Alfon&s;o III. Ferdinand I. Alfon&s;o VI.; and particularly Alfon&s;o VIII. and Fer|dinand III.; and &s;till more Ferdinand and I&s;abel, the great friends of the people, under who&s;e joint reign the towns, through indu&s;try and wealth, were growing fa&s;t into weight and con&s;equence in the &s;tate; &s;o much that you know they formed a powerful oppo&s;ition, and at la&s;t a war,
<PB N="295" REF="301">
again&s;t Charles V. who did not under&s;tand them or their con&s;titution &s;o well as Fer|dinand. But the efforts of tho&s;e monarchs &s;eem to us only like temporary &s;hifts, with|out &s;y&s;tem or fore&s;ight. They &s;eem not to have known the importance nor the me|thods of e&s;tabli&s;hing the third power in the &s;tate, as a permanent weight in the balance again&s;t the nobles, which was &s;o much wanted by all tho&s;e Spani&s;h princes; a weight which you will &s;ee all wi&s;e princes &s;teadily &s;upport, being a much better way of managing the ari&s;tocratic power, than the pre&s;ent general method of oppre&s;&s;ing and taxing the people in order to pen&s;ion the nobility, by which both cla&s;&s;es are &s;poiled, and the nation is debilitated. Had Charles V. been wi&s;e enough to regulate and fix that third power in the legi&s;lature, in&s;tead of curbing, and thence gradually annihilating it, the government, and the country, might have gone on improving, and Spain would have remained &s;till the fir&s;t and mo&s;t powerful nation in Europe.</P>
<P>As our modern &s;y&s;tem of indu&s;try and avarice advanced, money gradually ac|quired
<PB N="296" REF="302">
more influence over mankind; and at length, I &s;uppo&s;e, all power and authority will &s;trictly follow property in whatever hands it may be found: and if a Dru&s;us, or &s;ome other of the ancient independent &s;pirits, were to revive, he would hardly find any road open to eminence, except that of the mi&s;er. However, while there is any &s;en&s;e of merit left in the world, virtues and talents will &s;ometimes break into notice, and may command the rich. Here, in Ca&s;tile, you will find the <HI>ricos homes</HI> began &s;oon to have more than their &s;hare of influence in the Cortes; and after|wards, as nobles, they went on accumulat|ing riches and power, which, in future conte&s;ts, were &s;eized by the crown through much blood and anarchy. Such has gene|rally been, and mu&s;t probably always be, the hi&s;tory of governments where the third power, or the people, are not &s;upported. Might not this third power be &s;o regulated and e&s;tabli&s;hed, when well &s;upported by the intere&s;t of the crown, as to &s;upply the defects and fluctuations of property, and, in &s;pite of poverty, maintain the nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="297" REF="303">
importance and influence of the people? But then you may &s;ay, that &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem would require a perpetual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of wi&s;e, &s;cientific, and liberal monarchs; and for that purpo&s;e, a better kind of education would be nece&s;&s;ary than it &s;eems now the fa&s;hion to give to princes.</P>
<P>Our Engli&s;h plan of repre&s;entation, which came in &s;uch good time to &s;upport a falling people, I am &s;orry to &s;ee, is not &s;o generally known and under&s;tood as it de|&s;erves; and if we &s;hould neglect to com|plete the &s;y&s;tem, and to en&s;ure its duration, it may, before it is perfected, &s;uffer &s;ome unmerited di&s;credit, which may prevent or retard its imitation or revival at &s;ome future period, for the benefit of mankind. How many things combine to retard the progre&s;s of the great &s;cience of government! Wi&s;e and liberal principles are very long in gain|ing a footing among men, and, on certain occa&s;ions, are all driven out again in a moment. From the time that Charles V. by force or influence in the Cortes, I be|lieve here at St. Jago, got it e&s;tabli&s;hed
<PB N="298" REF="304">
to vote the &s;upplies always before the re|dre&s;s of grievances&mdash;from that time the con&s;titution was gone: the forms were pre&s;erved, as if only to give time to con|vince the public, by a kind of pretended &s;pecious experience, that tho&s;e a&s;&s;emblies were unnece&s;&s;ary and burden&s;ome: and by the decay of finance, their di&s;u&s;e became at la&s;t a matter of oeconomy and nece&s;&s;ity; as the maintaining a majority there was at|tended with more difficulty and expence, than a very con&s;iderable increa&s;e of the army, which was known to an&s;wer that and &s;everal other purpo&s;es more effectually; and thus came to be gradually e&s;tabli&s;hed here, one of the mo&s;t unlimited tyrannies in Europe. And we cannot wi&s;h for a better example to &s;hew the effects of de|&s;troying and replacing an e&s;tabli&s;hed free con&s;titution by an arbitrary government, than the gradual decline of this country ever &s;ince that period. Hardly any of their writers dare yet look up to this fir&s;t &s;ource of their decline: they &s;eem complai&s;antly to &s;hift the cau&s;e, and willing to place it on mi&s;management. The bolde&s;t trace it
<PB N="299" REF="305">
to the end of Philip II.: but he only pur&s;ued the &s;y&s;tem, and employed and ex|hau&s;ted the broken con&s;titution, left by his father. The re&s;ult or accumulation of a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of bad management during that and the following reigns, the natural con&s;e|quence of unlimited power, &s;eemed to fall with an accelerated weight upon that of Philip IV. and Charles II. They now per&s;i&s;t in expecting a complete recovery from their Bourbon government, in &s;pite of the experience of near a century, and after repeated di&s;appointments, more than &s;ufficient to &s;hew them the fallacy of their hopes.</P>
<P>It would &s;eem, that ab&s;olute governments cannot be improved by the addition of minute regulations and &s;ubdivi&s;ions, and are only embarra&s;&s;ed, in&s;tead of being tem|pered or directed, by an increa&s;e of legal forms and councils. Such governments may &s;ometimes be admini&s;tered by good men, as this &s;eems to be at pre&s;ent, and then &s;ome little improvements may be made. But this nation &s;eems too far &s;unk ever to
<PB N="300" REF="306">
be rai&s;ed to any thing con&s;iderable by &s;mall and temporary regulations: it is plain the&s;e mini&s;ters can do little or no good: they cannot find tools to work with in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things and condition of the people; the fallacious forms and in&s;titutions an&s;wer none of the purpo&s;es expected from them! Though they may pretend, or really aim at the public good, they cannot hit it; they &s;oon perceive it impo&s;&s;ible; then turn to follow their own intere&s;t, which unfor|tunately is not that of the nation; and the benefit of the people can, with them, only be a &s;econdary con&s;ideration at be&s;t. In|deed, &s;ubdivi&s;ions of power &s;eem to be adopted in this country only when u&s;ele&s;s or hurtful: each of the numerous depart|ments of government is here a &s;eparate and independent de&s;pot, with authority enough to oppre&s;s and do mi&s;chief, but without either power or di&s;po&s;ition to do good. With all our chain of controls, from par|liament downwards, you know how dif|ficult it is with us to get the public bu&s;ine&s;s properly executed; how little each man is di&s;po&s;ed to do more than barely his duty,
<PB N="301" REF="307">
and how &s;ubject every department is to corrupt practices, and a domineering &s;pirit. Human power, and &s;elf-intere&s;t, cannot pre&s;cribe bounds to them&s;elves; the&s;e mu&s;t be placed by force, nece&s;&s;ity, and other hands. Government, or &s;ociety, &s;hould be a &s;y&s;tem of checks, or of mutual con|trol. We might as well, in mechanics, look for a &s;elf-motion that &s;hould begin, continue, and end, without a cau&s;e, as expect from human beings the duties of &s;ociety without &s;ufficient motives and control.</P>
<P>Though ju&s;tice is tardy in this country, they were going to hang a poor man di|rectly the other day, a &s;ervant of the king's, for amu&s;ing him&s;elf in writing let|ters about an imaginary con&s;piracy; and his being di&s;covered to be fooli&s;h could hardly &s;ave him. There are many new regulations in the palace, and new edicts on this occa&s;ion. Many more are expect|ed about the roads, the poor, on com|merce, &amp;c. This tyrannic and fooli&s;h government &s;eems fonder of regulations
<PB N="302" REF="308">
than the free&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t we know: it is for ever regulating the people, as if it loved them: but it is &s;oon perceptible, that to impoveri&s;h or divide, to terrify or weaken them, is the grand object of all tho&s;e ef|forts of their wi&s;dom and my&s;tery. As it is in the nature of power to become more cautious and timid as it grows more de|&s;potic, and to dread and hate the people always more than they de&s;erve, hence that perpetual de&s;ire which it &s;hews for more and more laws and authority over them; and which, by con&s;idering them as wor&s;e than they really are, by &s;uppo&s;ing them bad, &s;eems purpo&s;ely to make them &s;o.</P>
<P>Now I think the contrary conduct has been found to &s;ucceed be&s;t with mankind: both individuals and bodies of men have been ob&s;erved to improve, and become more worthy of confidence, by being tru&s;t|ed; and they may be ob&s;erved to have pro&s;pered in proportion to the liberty and &s;ecurity in which they have been left to live, and to manage their own affairs: and I believe nearly in this proportion we
<PB N="303" REF="309">
&s;hall actually find the powers, indu&s;try, the merits of all the people we know, from the la&s;t up to the fir&s;t, from the mi&s;erable African or Siberian &s;lave, up to the active and independent inhabi|tant of Great Britain. Believe men ca|pable of great virtues or efforts, and they will commonly exert them&s;elves to become &s;o in reality. Many of the lowe&s;t Spaniards may yet be &s;purred on to exert great ef|forts of friend&s;hip and liberality, by tru&s;t|ing them, and &s;hewing a confidence in the old reputation of their honour, though they may now be far inferior to their an|ce&s;tors who gained them that reputation. A general Wolfe could per&s;uade, and very &s;oon believe, a &s;et of common fellows, of which his regiment was compo&s;ed, to be incapable of de&s;ertion, and they accord|ingly &s;oon became &s;o; when he had &s;uffi|ciently prepared them by his &s;peeches and orders, guards and &s;entries, which had been placed in vain to prevent their e&s;cape, were called in, and the de&s;ertion cea&s;ed. There is a di&s;cipline which might be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed through men's minds more readily
<PB N="304" REF="310">
than by the drill, but which few officers under&s;tand. An Alexander could &s;take his life again&s;t the probability of his phy&s;ici|an's treachery. Such great &s;pirits, capable of &s;uch confidence, mu&s;t, of cour&s;e, form others like them&s;elves, and will generally be well &s;erved.</P>

The high opinion I have of the Spani&s;h character and behavi|our <HI>(trato)</HI> may be rather new to you, and may differ from that of many, but it is not the le&s;s founded, and has been long the &s;ame. The contra&s;t between the pro|fe&s;&s;ions and the practice of friend&s;hip and ho&s;pitality, between real and affected honour and civility, is doubtle&s;s a very &s;triking feature in modern manners, owing I be|lieve chiefly to France; and the Spaniards, with all their honour and &s;incerity, are not entirely exempt from it. A &s;emblance of virtue may be better than none: but the romantic purity of manners and principles, &s;till a&s;&s;umed by &s;ome, and particularly tho&s;e of high rank, though it may be better than nothing, yet becomes wor&s;e
<PB N="307" REF="313">
than ridiculous when we come to know more of their private hi&s;tory. The habits of politene&s;s, by e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;tom, may properly enough &s;upply the place of real goodne&s;s, civility, benevolence, and many other virtues; yet when carried too far, they may become deceit: how far, is hard to &s;ay. It is very difficult to e&s;timate virtues and vices that depend &s;o much on degree and fa&s;hion. In order to under&s;tand the&s;e things, you mu&s;t know what they call the world; that is to &s;ay, the men and women of it: reading is in&s;ufficient; you mu&s;t travel among, and live with, all ranks and nations.</P>
<P>It is likewi&s;e very difficult to judge rightly of the ta&s;te and predominant pa&s;&s;ions of men and nations, even after living much with them. If the people in this quiet na|tion can be &s;aid to love any thing with warmth or ardour, be&s;ides their dances and amu&s;ements, I think it may occa&s;ion|ally be, 1. Revenge. 2. Indolence. 3. In|trigue. Their hatred, which is probably &s;tronger, &s;eems mo&s;t readily directed, 1. Again&s;t here&s;y, or rather heretics; 2.
<PB N="308" REF="314">
Again&s;t the French; and 3. Again&s;t &s;trangers, or all the re&s;t of mankind. Ci|vilization is properly enough mea&s;ured by attention to &s;trangers: here, as in other countries, in the &s;ea-ports, and near the coa&s;t, they are more attentive, polite, and ea&s;ier reconciled to foreigners, than more inland. They u&s;ed to prefer the Engli&s;h to all other nations, but I fear that prefer|ence is now on the decline, and ready to change its object.</P>
<P>It is &s;till more difficult to e&s;timate the happine&s;s of men or of &s;ocieties. If the exerci&s;e of the human powers, our &s;ciences and improvements, with all the increa&s;e of ideas and plea&s;ures which attend them, do not bring us more good than evil, more plea&s;ure than pain, we mu&s;t appre|tiate happine&s;s by the degrees of ignorance, inactivity, and in&s;en&s;ibility, which will lead us to conclude, with the oppre&s;&s;ed and enervated A&s;iatic, that non-exi&s;tence is the be&s;t of all. But if, as I believe, this is not a true but a fallacious &s;tatement of the ca&s;e; if our exi&s;tence and our faculties are given us to be u&s;ed, I know of no
<PB N="309" REF="315">
better mea&s;ure of men's happine&s;s than their activity, and the voluntary exertion of their powers and faculties. The more &s;pirit and activity men &s;hew in the di&s;|charge of their various duties, and the fewer they neglect, the happier they mu&s;t be. We daily &s;ee that &s;ome object of pur&s;uit is nece&s;&s;ary to us, without which we can neither be active nor happy. It is needle&s;s to recal to your mind any of the numerle&s;s ob&s;ervations that will occur to prove this doctrine. In activity then of mind and body, more than in re&s;t, mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t the happine&s;s of human life; and more in the activity it&s;elf than in the at|tainment of tho&s;e objects to which it leads. Upon this principle or &s;cale I &s;hould place this nation among the lea&s;t happy, e&s;pecially in winter, and the Engli&s;h per|haps among the mo&s;t happy.</P>
<P>Although we at pre&s;ent &s;ee here little el&s;e remaining but the &s;keleton, &s;o to &s;peak, of the old Spani&s;h character, pride and patience, we mu&s;t perhaps except the female part of &s;ociety. The female character
<PB N="310" REF="316">
is probably improved, while the male may have declined, throughout modern Europe. The &s;ex improves by &s;ociety, even though we keep them from knowledge; and they here now po&s;&s;e&s;s more dome&s;tic, &s;ocial, and u&s;eful virtues, than formerly, when more &s;ecluded from the world. They were then &s;ubject to more indolence and timidity, to a &s;lovenly indifference, and po&s;itive vices, and had only a few negative virtues at be&s;t. We find them endowed with all the attention and goodne&s;s, tenderne&s;s and humanity, &s;o becoming their &s;ex, and which they be&s;tow on all around them, except here|tics, of whom many of them &s;hew the greate&s;t dread and aver&s;ion, though &s;ome|times mixed with compa&s;&s;ion. Several of the Spani&s;h ladies are &s;till too much indulged in indolence, and &s;ome|what &s;poiled by fal&s;e delicacies and re|finements; others, who have had &s;en&s;e and re&s;olution to break through the re|&s;traints of fa&s;hionable idlene&s;s, have be|come manly and active, and can now ride, hunt, and labour in the garden, better than
<PB N="311" REF="317">
many of us: and &s;ome Aragone&s;e gentle|men, I knew, have brought up their daughters in this way.</P>
<P>In &s;pite of the flattery and &s;elf-conceit of the times, I believe the Bourbon period of Spani&s;h hi&s;tory will make but a poor figure in their future annals. Almo&s;t every thing of importance that has been attempt|ed by that government, has hitherto failed of &s;ucce&s;s. At the Bourbon acce&s;&s;ion, the exhau&s;ted and depopulated &s;tate of the country, though great, was not however beyond the powers of liberal principles and good management to re-e&s;tabli&s;h: and it is but too evident, that this jealous govern|ment, &s;ubject to no legal and effectual mode of influence or control from the people, has been either unable or unwilling to accom|pli&s;h the re&s;toration of a kingdom per|haps naturally the rival of France.</P>
<P>Their pre&s;ent mini&s;try &s;eems to be among the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible and efficient that they have had for &s;ome time pa&s;t, except that of the Conde de Heranda, and perhaps that of En&s;enada; but they, you
<PB N="312" REF="318">
know, were not permitted to go on: and &s;uch will probably be the future hi&s;tory of Spain while a province of the Bourbon empire. Whenever they begin evidently to ri&s;e, &s;ome French trick or intrigue will al|ways be at hand to &s;lip away the ladder. Some of the&s;e mini&s;ters, being reputed men of bu&s;ine&s;s, give ri&s;e to &s;anguine hopes; too &s;anguine, as u&s;ual here: for, &s;uppo&s;ing them really zealous and &s;incere in their endeavours and profe&s;&s;ions, what can they do with this yet exhau&s;ted and indolent nation, if they will not, or cannot re&s;tore them their con&s;titution; the only effectual means, I believe, of recovery. Several of what they think very important regulations in commerce and police are beginning to be adopted, and others ex|pected, if not all interrupted by their taking a part in this fooli&s;h and unfortunate war. They are going to be as great fools as our|&s;elves. Folly &s;eems to be contagious at certain periods.</P>
<P>Their premier F. B. was bred to the law, and &s;ome time at Rome, from which it is thought he mu&s;t know &s;ome|thing;
<PB N="313" REF="319">
but he has not power to do much. Others allege, that really great politicians would place him only among the little ones: that he relies too much on that left-handed wi&s;dom, artifice and cunning; if &s;o, he employs the be&s;t ma&s;k, a frank and open man|ner, <HI>volto &s;ciolto et pen&s;ieri &s;tretti,</HI> which he probably learned at Rome. Mr. G. may know South America, but it is doubt|ed if he knows Europe, or the true princi|ples of commerce, or of dome&s;tic police and pro&s;perity: but the&s;e, though the pre&s;ent favourite topics here, we cannot expect to be well under&s;tood in the mo&s;t anti-commercial nation, while they are not yet well under&s;tood in the mo&s;t en|lightened.</P>
<P>But it &s;eems to be again the fa&s;hion of late, for princes to covet the reputation of being their own mini&s;ters, &s;o that it would appear to be of le&s;s importance who is nominally &s;o: and they &s;eem likewi&s;e in|clined to employ new men, probably from a natural dread and jealou&s;y which ab&s;olute
<PB N="314" REF="320">
monarchy mu&s;t always have again&s;t ari&s;to|cratic power. But neither of the&s;e &s;y&s;tems can, I believe, an&s;wer the purpo&s;es intend|ed. Our Engli&s;h ideas of the nece&s;&s;ary re&s;pon&s;ibility of mini&s;ters are well found|ed, in the nature of men and of princes, and indeed are openly or tacitly acknow|ledged almo&s;t everywhere: it has mani|fe&s;tly appeared here lately in the ca&s;e of <HI>Squilacci;</HI> and it &s;eems to be tacitly under|&s;tood even at Con&s;tantinople. The greate&s;t mini&s;ters have always undertaken their office on tho&s;e terms of re&s;pon&s;ibility, and have &s;ubmitted to them with the be&s;t and the bolde&s;t grace. The people will gene|rally con&s;ider mini&s;ters as an&s;werable for public mea&s;ures. Indeed, a certain degree of re&s;pon&s;ibility and publicity are highly nece&s;&s;ary in many public mea&s;ures, being the only checks that remain again&s;t various kinds of tyranny, which, on the other hand, is always &s;truggling to get rid even of the&s;e, and of every other re&s;traint. That of rai&s;ing and employing new families in preference to the old and powerful, is the weak expedient of weak princes, and will
<PB N="315" REF="321">
generally create them more enemies than friends. The third power, the people, or democratic part, well regulated and e&s;ta|bli&s;hed (which a wi&s;e monarch can always manage and direct, &s;o as to balance an ambitious ari&s;tocracy), will always be a much better expedient, and an&s;wer the above and every other purpo&s;e more com|pletely.</P>
<P>Princes ought undoubtedly to be equal to the ta&s;k of admini&s;tration; not that they may do the bu&s;ine&s;s them&s;elves, but only &s;ee it properly done by others. A general, or head of any department, ought perhaps to be capable of &s;erving in any inferior &s;tation in it; but it is not nece&s;&s;ary, nay it is highly improper, that he &s;hould do it. His duty is, to &s;ee that every man do his duty; to in&s;pect the whole, and know that every part of the machine is properly placed and employed, and the whole produces its ef|fect: this would only be impeded by his attempting to &s;upply, with his own hand, the work of any part. Great and com|prehen&s;ive minds are known by their ar|rangements
<PB N="316" REF="322">
on the great and general &s;cale, and not by what they them&s;elves can execute in detail. On tho&s;e principles, examine a Roman or a Pru&s;&s;ian army, an Engli&s;h navy, a Grecian, Roman, or Engli&s;h government, and you will &s;ee their &s;trength and &s;ucce&s;s generally depend on each part performing only its own &s;hare of the work, and on its being pro|perly and &s;ufficiently employed: or if any parts do more than their duty, it is by the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive a&s;cending of the parts below, and not by the de&s;cent of tho&s;e above. In great plans, that require much time for completion, we mu&s;t regret that &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors &s;o &s;eldom carry on the ideas of their predece&s;&s;ors, and that nature &s;eems to have planted a kind of enmity between them.</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s, in the education of princes, it cannot be too much inculcated, that there is no certain way of creating or of employing merit in its proper place, with|out being thoroughly and practically a judge of it; nor of avoiding impo&s;ition,
<PB N="317" REF="323">
or of directing the various departments, without knowing the principles and the practice of each; nor without the great &s;cience or knowledge of men.</P>
<P>We cannot avoid &s;peculating &s;ometimes thus on &s;ubjects perhaps above our reach. We mu&s;t often judge of our &s;uperiors, who require the control both of private and public opinion, as well as of others; and we all require &s;ome.</P>

<P>I OBEY your commands, and go on to ob&s;erve and reflect, &s;ince we cannot yet get away. But you mu&s;t not be &s;ur|pri&s;ed if this naked country &s;hould be found rather barren of u&s;eful matter, even for reflection; or if the&s;e letters &s;hould &s;avour &s;till more of their Spani&s;h &s;ource, and turn to idle and indolent &s;peculation. Doubtle&s;s, there are many &s;ingularities to be ob&s;erved of this nation: I wi&s;h to give you only the mo&s;t important. Their &s;eparate &s;ituation I con&s;ider as the &s;ource of many of tho&s;e &s;ingularities; of their being le&s;s known, of their knowing le&s;s of the world, and of their being le&s;s influ|enced by its changes, than almo&s;t any other European nation. Hence manners, &s;ociety, arts, trades, police, are more &s;ta|tionary,
<PB N="319" REF="325">
and as it were left behind, and become more the objects of curio&s;ity. The Spaniards are, however, obliged to con|form at la&s;t to the &s;y&s;tem of which they are a part, and we perceive them to Philippi&s;e, <HI>i. e.</HI> to Frenchify, within the memory of man. They keep following, though at a di&s;tance, the errors as well as improvements of others. They have not yet gone through half the non&s;en&s;e they are probably doomed to pa&s;s, and with their &s;low character they will be long about it. By opening their American trade with one hand, and &s;hutting it up with the other by monopolies and prohi|bitions, they are now only imitating the pedlar and tyrannic &s;y&s;tems of other na|tions. The people and territory at home &s;urely de&s;erve the fir&s;t and always the greate&s;t attention, and any colony or trade that does not tend to improve the&s;e, mu&s;t be a burden, and without &s;ome other balance or &s;upport mu&s;t at length bring down any nation, as it has done this. I fear mo&s;t of our modern colonies have this tendency, chiefly owing to that gra&s;ping
<PB N="320" REF="326">
monopoli&s;ing &s;pirit, of confining their trade, &amp;c. entirely to our&s;elves.</P>
<P>Colonial commerce has generally been over-rated: that of this country, which the nation has &s;o greedily engro&s;&s;ed, and by which they are more than engro&s;&s;ed, to con&s;ider it only in a pecuniary view, will never probably amount to one-tenth of the value of the bread only that they eat; and cannot promote indu&s;try, as they will never &s;ufficiently open their trade, nor al|low the money to have any of its good effects, by circulating freely in and out of the country. Were they even to grant a bounty on its export, it might be better than attempting to hoard or dam it up within their dominions. But we have all been &s;ubject to the &s;ame errors. Is not there now &s;ome hope of our being cured of them? New events, new principles, and experience, mu&s;t &s;urely in time open our eyes. But I think nations &s;eldom learn political wi&s;dom of each other: folly &s;eems far more contagious. Perhaps it mu&s;t be &s;o; as it is not the wi&s;dom of age and ex|perience
<PB N="321" REF="327">
that lead the fa&s;hion, or that can always be heard amid&s;t the pa&s;&s;ions of the young, and the intere&s;ts of the rich and powerful.</P>
<P>Prohibition often &s;uperadds the evils of monopoly to its own; here are many; as in cottons, to exclude tho&s;e of Man|che&s;ter, again&s;t which there appears a pe|culiar enmity in this government, propor|tioned to the ta&s;te of the people in their favour. This prohibition is now meant to favour a company of monopoli&s;ts in Cata|lonia, who pretend to manufacture enough, but cannot produce one-tenth of the na|tional demand, and they therefore &s;muggle and &s;ell at their own price. It would be endle&s;s to enumerate the evils of mono|polies, prohibitions, and exce&s;&s;ive duties. Other nations might &s;ee here many of their ruinous effects, and learn. We may &s;ee verified in practice, the doctrine of our friend A. Smith, <HI>viz.</HI> That high duties, 1. tempt to &s;muggle; 2. de&s;troy men; 3. le&s;&s;en revenue; 4. &s;top or dimini&s;h trade; 5. em|ploy too many hands badly; 6. &s;ome
<PB N="322" REF="328">
of whom oppre&s;s and tyranni&s;e, and help to de&s;troy the ideas of ju&s;tice; 7. all of which curtail the &s;upply of our wants, and the increa&s;e of indu&s;try. Perfection does not lie that way. It would be better to have no duties than have them too high. They may be con&s;idered, at be&s;t, as ne|ce&s;&s;ary evils, as may al&s;o the wars, national animo&s;ities, and commercial jealou&s;ies, from which many of them proceed; tho&s;e wars have &s;ome good effects, though many bad. It would &s;urely be better, on the whole, if &s;ociety could exi&s;t without tho&s;e evils: and if all duties were aboli&s;hed, na|tions might then communicate freely, &s;up|ply each other's wants and knowledge, and the world would improve much fa&s;ter. Though this &s;hould be romantic and impracticable with our pre&s;ent habits, debts, and expen&s;ive governments, it may &s;how us which way we &s;hould &s;teer, and the nearer we can come to it the better. Hence, to le&s;&s;en our duties, and rai&s;e our revenues internally, in the way of exci&s;e, as much as po&s;&s;ible, like the Dutch, mu&s;t be the next be&s;t. Begin by opening your

ports; &s;tore all your imports duty free, till wanted for con&s;umption, or exportation; and avoid the inconveniencies, the great expence, and <HI>faux frais</HI> of drawbacks, officers, and other regulations: hence more trade with le&s;s capital. In this country, they load with duties, or prohibit any thing before they can furni&s;h it them&s;elves, and the people either &s;muggle, or learn to do without it, which prevents the growth of natural wants and indu&s;try, and maintains the national character of indolence and <HI>haraganaria.</HI></P>

<HEAD>To Mr. C&mdash;.</HEAD>
<P>COMMERCE and political oeconomy are now the fa&s;hionable and fertile &s;ubjects of inquiry here, and every where: doubtle&s;s, they are better under&s;tood than formerly, and much ingenious &s;peculation, and &s;ome uncontroverted principles, have been produced and admitted; yet national governments are nece&s;&s;arily tardy in adopt|ing new &s;y&s;tems. I think they are all apt to be too cautious, like this nation: hence the very &s;low progre&s;s of the human &s;pecies in the art of government, and in all kinds of knowledge that concerns the public. The Engli&s;h &s;hould take the lead, and be the fir&s;t to introduce a greater freedom of commercial intercour&s;e between nations
<PB N="325" REF="331">
than at pre&s;ent. Our &s;uperior know|ledge in the&s;e &s;ubjects entitles us to the place of leaders. But the wrangling &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition, though nece&s;&s;ary in our legi&s;lature, is the cau&s;e of much delay, of a lo&s;s of time and opportunities. We can, however, make wars and treaties, and debate them afterwards: a fine field for mini&s;terial wi&s;dom and policy. But I fear our mini&s;ters do not always con&s;ult proper people, and, like other men, are too much confined to the accidental circle of their own acquaintance.</P>
<P>But I intended to &s;ay &s;omething more of Spani&s;h politics. Spain ought certainly to remain neuter now, if ever: &s;he can never probably get into &s;uch a favourable &s;ituation again, nor can &s;he gain &s;o much by the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful war as &s;he might now by trade. In the pre&s;ent &s;tate and employment of nations and their &s;hips, the world will &s;oon want carriers and neu|tral flags, and Trade would be glad of an a&s;ylum on the exten&s;ive coa&s;ts of this pe|nin&s;ula, if its inhabitants, or rather go|vernment, knew how to receive her. By
<PB N="326" REF="332">
her means, if a&s;&s;i&s;ted with a little political wi&s;dom, improvement might perhaps be carried a little farther into this naked country. Its coa&s;t being the plea&s;ante&s;t and mo&s;t cultivated part, like a lace &s;et round an old threadbare coat, might thus be made to extend its little improvements in the mo&s;t natural way, <HI>de proche en proche;</HI> which might lead them to di&s;cover and remove &s;ome of the numerous impedi|ments to the cultivation of their lands, the mo&s;t natural &s;ource of arts and pro&s;perity. At pre&s;ent, it is &s;eldom attempted or thought of here, except &s;ometimes by a nobleman, who, being bani&s;hed from a dirty capital to a plea&s;ant country, &s;ets about improving his e&s;tate, <HI>pour &s;e de&s;en|nuyer.</HI> Or &s;ometimes a rich Creol finds a little land to purcha&s;e, and by cultivating it, &s;preads plenty and indu&s;try around him, and &s;hews his country the true founda|tion of national pro&s;perity. But all is in|&s;ufficient to open their eyes: they go on trying to build their fabric on colonial commerce, which might con&s;titute a part, though not a nece&s;&s;ary part, of the future
<PB N="327" REF="333">
&s;tructure, but can never &s;erve as a good foundation.</P>
<P>Again&s;t the probability of Spani&s;h ho&s;ti|lity you rea&s;on rightly, and your conclu|&s;ion would be ju&s;t if your premi&s;es were true: I will go farther, and from a nearer view of the &s;tate of their country, allow that every con&s;ideration ought to deter them from entering now into a war, probably full of many pernici|ous con&s;equences to them, by which they will give up many obvious advan|tages, and again &s;top every &s;ource and hope of improvement; without any material object in view, except the poor chance of taking Gibraltar by the tedious and ex|pen&s;ive operations of a blockade. As to Gibraltar, it can be of very little &s;ervice to them now, whatever it may be fifty years hence, in ca&s;e of the improvement of their country, population, and com|merce; the probability of which, however, you know I doubt. They might now draw more advantages from that garri&s;on than if it was in their own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: they want to bring colonies of inhabitants into
<PB N="328" REF="334">
Spain, and here is already a rich one with|out any expence: much of the money of that place might be turned into Spain, through the proper indu&s;trious channels, which would help to improve the country to a great di&s;tance; this it has indeed already done to a con&s;iderable degree, in &s;pite of their &s;ullen, inveterate, and im|provident mea&s;ures. By &s;upplying the garri&s;on they would increa&s;e their own markets, and have the place more in their power. All their expence might be a little lo&s;s of revenue by &s;muggling, which how|ever might be kept under, though never entirely &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, by them&s;elves; or we could &s;top it when we plea&s;ed, whenever their court &s;hould behave with common politene&s;s and good policy.</P>
<P>But it is in vain to expect &s;uch mea&s;ures, or half &s;o much wi&s;dom, from &s;uch a go|vernment: you &s;hould recollect, that they do not rea&s;on as we do, and that few king|doms are governed by the principles of their own intere&s;t, nor even by tho&s;e of common &s;en&s;e: that happens only &s;ome|times where the voice of an enlightened
<PB N="329" REF="335">
nation can and will be heard, through their repre&s;entatives, in a well-con&s;tituted legi&s;lature. The pa&s;&s;ions, manners, pre|judices, of a court, of a confe&s;&s;or, or a mi&s;tre&s;s, often determine the mo&s;t im|portant political mea&s;ures. I hope you likewi&s;e perceive, what is obvious to all the world be&s;ide, that the Bourbon in|tere&s;t and influence will always ulti|mately prevail here, whatever tedious and pretended deliberations, or other ma&s;ks, may be employed. You are al&s;o to take into account the hone&s;t and ob&s;tinate adherence of his pre&s;ent Catholic Maje&s;ty to all his treaties, principles, and engage|ments; and the inveteracy of this court again&s;t England, now even greater than that of France. From the&s;e premi&s;es you may draw ju&s;ter conclu&s;ions concerning their future mea&s;ures. In &s;hort, this king|dom mu&s;t probably long be as effectually governed by France as one of her own provinces.

family intere&s;t, the local &s;ituation, all cement the connection. When Spain was reduced to a third of the population of France, and her force and indu&s;try to a &s;till le&s;s proportion, it became a natural and ea&s;y matter for the &s;uperior to rule. Nor is there now any probability of &s;uch cau&s;es or events as formerly produced an Alberoni or a Riperda; nor could &s;uch men find means to counteract the pre&s;ent cour&s;e of affairs. Spain mu&s;t be governed by France till brought nearer to an equality with that kingdom. Our fir&s;t great object would be to rai&s;e her to that equality: if &s;he re&s;i&s;ts, or cannot be rai&s;ed, our next be&s;t is to con&s;ider her as our natural enemy. Mo&s;t of the&s;e &s;hould be &s;et down as fixed princi|ples, &s;ome of which we may endeavour to temper and mitigate; others can only be overcome by force. Even the termination of the pre&s;ent reign cannot change the nature of things. France has not watched and directed the affairs of this kingdom during near a century, and brought them to their pre&s;ent dependent &s;tate, to let the event de|pend on the life or opinions of any one,

or of a few per&s;ons, or any little intrigue of an old worn-out party. All the old &s;tock of &s;ecret enmity again&s;t the Bourbon power is now cru&s;hed or worn out. Government, in extirpating the roots of the late party again&s;t <HI>Squillacci,</HI> took oc|ca&s;ion to cut up tho&s;e of the old oppo&s;ition. But we may fancy we &s;ee forming, at a di&s;tance, a more re&s;pectable party than any of the&s;e, a party built upon rea&s;on, &s;cience, on the natural love of liberty and their old con&s;titution. The &s;ame &s;entiments and events may perhaps revive in Europe with &s;cience and civilization, as formerly in Greece, <HI>viz.</HI> tho&s;e of political liberty, at|tended with the limitation or bani&s;hment of all their tyrants; and we &s;hould hope now with le&s;s ri&s;k of running into the op|po&s;ite extremes of republicani&s;m.

<P>Some have imagined, that as our po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing Gibraltar has hurt the pride of Spain, this is the cau&s;e and the only &s;ubject of difference, and that its ce&s;&s;ion would re&s;tore our friend&s;hip, and buy

Spain off from the family compact: no|thing like it; <HI>n'en croyez rien:</HI> the re&s;titu|tion of fifty Gibraltars could not now change the e&s;&s;entials of their &s;ituation, nor make them your friends, if France does not chu&s;e it. It is one of the effects, but not the cau&s;e of our difference: and they mu&s;t know little of the world who &s;uppo&s;e that we &s;hould have more influence over Spain without Gibraltar in hand than with it. Be&s;ides, I believe, we are &s;econded by mo&s;t nations in this mea&s;ure: many of them wi&s;h Gibraltar to be in our hands, rather than in tho&s;e of Spain, who, they well know, would tyrannize and de&s;troy, but never en|courage a free trade through the&s;e &s;traits, whenever Spain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es Gibraltar. You re|member how Mon&s;. le D. de C. in 1766 and 1767, prematurely blabbed the &s;ecret, like a little trifling Frenchman, if it had not been already known, repeatedly calling tho&s;e &s;traits his <HI>ma&s;ter's &s;eas,</HI> in his corre|&s;pondence with the governor of Gibraltar. And now that the alarm and jealou&s;y of our power mu&s;t gradually &s;ub&s;ide, even in &s;pite of French artifice to keep it up, we
<PB N="333" REF="339">
become &s;till more fit to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of that port and garri&s;on for the convenience of the world in general. Many of the Spaniards them&s;elves are plea&s;ed at our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing it, on acount of the trade and the hopes it af|fords to a great di&s;tance. As to the import|ance of that place, it will not probably be well known till after it is lo&s;t, or given up in &s;ome fooli&s;h negociation. That import|ance will be difficult to e&s;timate in Eng|land, and may produce &s;ome knotty que&s;|tions whenever di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. In order to judge, we mu&s;t know tho&s;e countries well that &s;urround the Mediterranean. If you do not know them your&s;elf, li&s;ten diligently to tho&s;e who do know them, and the trade they may produce. It is Gibraltar that now gives you mo&s;t of your &s;uperior con|&s;equence and influence in tho&s;e countries: without that place, your Mediterranean pa&s;&s;es, and maritime importance there, would &s;oon &s;ink to a level with tho&s;e of any other di&s;tant nation: your national pride, as well as intere&s;t, mu&s;t not admit of being yet reduced near to that level. Be&s;ides, that place mu&s;t be kept for rea&s;ons

of &s;tate, and of national honour and glory, which mini&s;ters well know cannot be e&s;ti|mated in pounds, &s;hillings, and pence.</P>
<P>From the times of ancient Greece and Rome, and perhaps long before, we know the Mediterranean has been a mo&s;t import|ant commercial &s;ea; nature has made it of the fir&s;t con&s;equence on this globe: &s;ixty or a hundred millions of people that &s;urround and communicate with it, render its com|merce and navigation of the greate&s;t con&s;e|quence to a maritime or commercial nation, and e&s;pecially to us, &s;ituated as we are. Now that our capitals may &s;oon be more at liberty, and not &s;o much engro&s;&s;ed by colony commerce, which is never equally beneficial with that of competition, let us hope that &s;ome capital may be &s;pared to the reviving of trade near home, where it is of mo&s;t importance, and particularly in tho&s;e &s;eas where all the &s;urrounding nations re|joice to &s;ee the Engli&s;h flag, and are &s;en&s;i|ble of their danger of being tyranni&s;ed over, in their trade and communication, by the Bourbon powers, if we were once exclud|ed.

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XXXII.</HI> Spani&s;h Charity and Poor. Spirit of Power, of Control, and of Government.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE we cannot yet leave Spain, I &s;hall go on with a few more ob&s;erva|tions and reflections. The great number of poor, and of charitable prelates and convents, which are generally found to|gether, being among the &s;triking features of this &s;tate of &s;ociety, as formerly with us, we have opportunities of &s;eeing all the good and evil of the&s;e old in&s;titutions. I do not think their charity de&s;erves the name of virtue, either from its motives or effects; the love of God, or fear of the devil, and not the benefit of the people, or of the public, being their motive and object; and in the way it is managed, becomes cer|tainly a political evil, and one of the wor&s;t parts of their very bad police. Their clergy are the mo&s;t improper to have charge
<PB N="337" REF="343">
of the poor: they cannot employ them; they only maintain them in idlene&s;s, and promote the trade of begging, which is become almo&s;t creditable in Spain and Por|tugal, and often very in&s;olent. The re|medy is doubtle&s;s difficult, like that of every e&s;tabli&s;hed abu&s;e: if tho&s;e chari|ties were to cea&s;e, numbers would be di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed; half their poor would &s;tarve: if in &s;ome other country, the other half might find means to work and live, but it is doubtful if they could here do either: their increa&s;e is an evil &s;o glaring and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing as to call loudly for redre&s;s even in this nation, where all redre&s;s is &s;o often reduced to patience. The &s;tate is repeatedly look|ed up to for relief, but in vain; though the &s;tate is not &s;o wi&s;ely con&s;tituted as to care, or be much intere&s;ted in &s;uch mat|ters, nor in the event of their own or of any other mea&s;ures, yet it is too jealous of power to give up the bu&s;ine&s;s to provincial or other management fitter for the ta&s;k, as often propo&s;ed: they always pretend to be preparing &s;ome effectual regulations. Such is the nature of the&s;e governments;
<PB N="338" REF="344">
half the nation might beg or &s;tarve before they would relinqui&s;h the &s;malle&s;t article of apparent power, Their <HI>ho&s;picios,</HI> and &s;chools of indu&s;try, are already on the de|cline before they are well begun. Govern|ment cannot execute the detail of &s;uch bu&s;ine&s;s: it can only at be&s;t prevent evil, but can &s;eldom do po&s;itive good: it may puni&s;h, but can &s;eldom reward, with ju&s;tice or effect.</P>
<P>We have more in&s;tances here of that jealous &s;pirit of power, of its increa&s;ing as the cau&s;es for it dimini&s;h, and gra|dually, as it overcomes all oppo&s;ition, of its becoming more timid and cautious. We &s;ee it in the detention of the nobility at court without nece&s;&s;ity, and evidently again&s;t the intere&s;t of the country; in the divi&s;ion of offices and cla&s;&s;es of people, in fomenting a certain deleterious &s;pirit of jealous di&s;tinction, in the true tyrannic or Moori&s;h &s;tyle; in the a&s;&s;umption of the municipal government, and management of every fund in every town&s;hip, by which their towns are become na&s;ty ruinous places, without police, or any po&s;&s;ibility of
<PB N="339" REF="345">
it. The&s;e mea&s;ures, together with the example of mo&s;t men in public employ, are more than &s;ufficient to bani&s;h all public &s;pirit and motives of union, while tho&s;e of di&s;cord reign with effect. The church, the military and naval departments, tho&s;e of finance and law, &s;trangers, towns and di&s;tricts, trades and profe&s;&s;ions, have each their di&s;tinct cla&s;s and &s;y&s;tem of laws and regulations, their different judges, courts, and methods of proceeding and appeal. The&s;e bodies thence become inveterate ene|mies and watchful &s;pies on each other, and exhibit &s;ociety as if its component parts were intended to injure and impede in&s;tead of a&s;&s;i&s;ting one another: the profe&s;&s;ed in|tention of order and regularity is con&s;tantly defeated, and the more probable one of di&s;union and contention promoted.</P>
<P>It might be amu&s;ing to trace how this feeble and timid policy has grown up among our modern governments. In the re&s;earch we &s;hould probably be carried as high as the di&s;&s;olution or decline of the Roman empire. From the time that Con|&s;tantine
<PB N="340" REF="346">
cho&s;e to regulate away all the re|mains of the ancient &s;implicity of Roman police, which favoured the union of differ|ent talents in the &s;ame per&s;on, and united the different parts of &s;ociety to the whole and to one another; and when Theodo&s;ius completed the &s;y&s;tem, and introduced the inqui&s;itorial &s;pirit of orthodoxy and per&s;e|cution; the motives and principles of en|mity were then increa&s;ed, and whole cla&s;&s;es of people became incorporated bodies of jealous enemies, in&s;pired with &s;ecret mutual animo&s;ity.</P>
<P>If a being who&s;e rea&s;on could always direct his pa&s;&s;ions and govern his actions, were to come among men to &s;et them right, of all the human pa&s;&s;ions he would be mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hed and baffled with that of the uni|ver&s;al love of power, ever blindly bent, in+&s;pite of all experience, on devouring all within its reach, and at la&s;t even it&s;elf, to|gether with tho&s;e it might mean to &s;ave: though often a&s;&s;umed at fir&s;t with the mo&s;t benevolent intentions towards mankind, its very kindne&s;s only tends at la&s;t to &s;queeze
<PB N="341" REF="347">
them to death. Societies, or bodies of men, are equally &s;ubject to this pa&s;&s;ion. We all require &s;ome control, and he that pretends to require none, is certainly not the mo&s;t to be tru&s;ted.</P>
<P>To bridle or regulate this pa&s;&s;ion has always been one of the chief objects of civil government, and the mo&s;t difficult ta&s;k with the wi&s;e&s;t lawgivers. Our own limited monarchy, profe&s;&s;ing to adopt a complete &s;y&s;tem of mutual checks to control every abu&s;e of power and art of impo&s;ition, has appeared &s;ometimes to bid the faire&s;t for &s;ucce&s;s. We might approach &s;till nearer to perfection, if we could com|plete our profe&s;&s;ed &s;y&s;tem, and form a le|gi&s;lature that &s;hould entirely include and balance the different intere&s;ts of every cla&s;s, and perfect the component parts already &s;o wi&s;ely &s;eparated and di&s;po&s;ed into legi&s;la|tive, executive, and judicial powers; if we could arrange and &s;implify as we go on; &s;y&s;tematize and abbreviate our huge and increa&s;ing code, in&s;tead of annually heaping &s;uch multitudes of needle&s;s and contradic|tory
<PB N="342" REF="348">
laws on each other. You &s;ee in our own hi&s;tory, how often all the complicated &s;y&s;tems of precaution again&s;t this pa&s;&s;ion for power have been defeated and worn out. From &s;uch repeated experience we might expect to be politically wi&s;er than we appear to be. Our la&s;t revolution is, of cour&s;e, the mo&s;t intere&s;ting to us, but all its tendency and effects &s;eem not yet to be well under&s;tood and inve&s;tigated. As it was rather hurried and incomplete, we might hope to &s;ee it gradually improved, and that we &s;hould not be &s;o overcautious in admitting of real improvements. I know many of you think human nature and human government are not capable of much higher perfection. To limit hu|man hopes and ideas of perfection, would not produce &s;tability, but a retrogradation. We were born for action, and mu&s;t ever be going either backward or forward. Better always be aiming at perfection, at the ri&s;k of going wrong &s;ometimes, than &s;tand &s;till. A &s;tate of perpetual tranquillity was not made for man, and may be as dangerous as the contrary extreme, and
<PB N="343" REF="349">
more hurtful to the human character. Every &s;y&s;tem of civil government, formed for the purpo&s;es of equal ju&s;tice and &s;uffi|cient liberty, mu&s;t be more complicated and trouble&s;ome than &s;imple de&s;poti&s;m; and the con&s;tant trouble and attention it re|quires, mu&s;t be part of the price to be paid for it: and might not &s;ome of the trouble be be&s;towed on &s;implifying and abridging the laws? It were to be wi&s;hed you had more gentlemen lawyers in your Hou&s;e, to help to keep tho&s;e of the profe&s;|&s;ion to order, and attentive to the mo&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;ary objects of legi&s;lation, though their bu&s;ine&s;s, and their numbers, might be thereby dimini&s;hed.</P>
<P>I can grant you, that we may &s;ometimes be at a lo&s;s to determine between the ad|vantages of leaving mankind free to find their own political happine&s;s with the ri&s;k of going wrong, and that of forcing them to their own good. In the one way, we &s;ee them become languid, weak, and in|dolent, in proportion as they are guided by force, though for their own benefit:
<PB N="344" REF="350">
and in the other, though all their powers increa&s;e by exerci&s;e, various impediments to the u&s;e of the&s;e powers &s;eem to increa&s;e with them. The one mode as it were de|prives us of our natural &s;trength, and the other impedes the u&s;e of it when acquired. The ill-united Provinces began to form a government, at the time they revolted from Spain, and have not yet been able to get half through the bu&s;ine&s;s. The American colonies may be at lea&s;t as long in ac|compli&s;hing the &s;ame, unle&s;s they &s;ubmit a little, and with more temper, to be a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed in it, by us their old friends. How many improvements are yet wanting in our own government, becau&s;e impeded by the tormenting, though nece&s;&s;ary vigilance of parties, mi&s;chievou&s;ly watching and op|po&s;ing each other? But as in religion, it may be &s;aid, that tho&s;e evils proceed from the abu&s;e of liberty, and not from the right u&s;e of it; and may not be adherent to liberty it&s;elf, but to the want of &s;ome arrangement nece&s;&s;ary to complete the &s;y&s;tem; if the good and evil of the&s;e two modes of government &s;hould appear nearly
<PB N="345" REF="351">
equal, the activity and exertion required, and hence acquired in that of the mo&s;t freedom, would turn the &s;cale in its favour. But though men are ea&s;ier led than driven, mo&s;t of them may require a little of both; and as nothing is perfect, we mu&s;t be contented with as great a portion of the good as we can. To govern man|kind, there mu&s;t be a &s;ufficiency of power placed &s;omewhere, even at the ri&s;k of its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors turning &s;ome of it to their own advantage, and paying them&s;elves for their trouble: and perhaps we can only check and curtail, but cannot entirely obviate all &s;uch abu&s;es, by the proper choice and con|trol of tho&s;e in power; though, for that purpo&s;e, it is perhaps better that we, the governed, retain the control than the choice of tho&s;e executive men. This &s;peculative kind of politics &s;eems productive of end|le&s;s &s;trings of reflections. Indebted to yours for their production, I more freely venture to tran&s;mit them, as they belong to &s;ubjects of your pre&s;ent and future en|quiry, as a traveller and a &s;enator, and they may furni&s;h matter and motives to
<PB N="346" REF="352">
think, as effectually as more regular and ela|borate di&s;qui&s;itions: they at lea&s;t &s;erve to amu&s;e, <HI>pendant que le monde ira &s;on train.</HI> But as I cannot give you all the reflections that occur, the choice is &s;till dif|ficult.</P>
<P>I am glad to find we &s;o nearly agree in our ideas of education as well as politics. There remains yet much to be done by abridging and &s;hortening the way to know|ledge, by which the &s;ame efforts would certainly carry us much quicker and farther on our journey thither. On this principle it is that algebra has &s;o greatly accelerated the progre&s;s of the mathematical &s;ciences, by bringing many objects and ideas into one view, and thence facilitating the com|pari&s;on, the rea&s;onings, and conclu&s;ions. Though we cannot put the Iliad into a nut &s;hell, yet in many &s;ubjects, by retaining only the e&s;&s;entials, and bringing tho&s;e nearer together, the con&s;equent reduction of the immen&s;e number of volumes and objects of re&s;earch that now oppre&s;s the inqui&s;itive mind with de&s;pair, would be of va&s;t &s;ervice to the world.</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="353">I am, perhaps, more &s;atisfied than plea&s;|ed to find, that you become &s;en&s;ible of the difficulties of reforming the world, which is a &s;ymptom of a mind improving into manhood: for mo&s;t young men are warm and zealous for total reformations, and are apt to go too fa&s;t and too far; while the aged are too cautious, and aware of the danger of every innovation: &s;o that youth and age &s;hould be cla&s;&s;ed in a way to a&s;&s;i&s;t and correct each other; the one for coun&s;el, and the other for action; and in the choice of men for different purpo&s;es, their years, as well as character, mu&s;t be con&s;idered. How to alter and improve, by any human wi&s;dom, the cha|racter of a whole people or nation, is yet a &s;ecret, as you ob&s;erve; and can only be done by time and events, which gradually change the temper of the mind, almo&s;t in|dependent of human endeavours. Sudden changes are &s;eldom de&s;irable. It is grada|tion that makes them both plea&s;ant and po&s;&s;ible. Perhaps improvements are more u&s;eful and acceptable, for pa&s;&s;ing through a certain progre&s;&s;ion of &s;teps and errors,
<PB N="348" REF="354">
analogous to the common march of the human mind.</P>
<P>Hardly any of our actual con&s;titutions of government can be a&s;cribed to hu|man plan or intention: accidental circum|&s;tances, habits, and opinions, change and e&s;tabli&s;h all the&s;e things for us with a &s;low and imperceptible pace. It is no wonder that we &s;hould &s;o &s;eldom fore&s;ee enough to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;ucce&s;sful &s;y&s;tems for futurity, for all our &s;agacity is often in&s;ufficient to de|cide concerning the cau&s;es of &s;uch events and changes as pa&s;s under our eye. The wi&s;e&s;t men have often the majority again&s;t them, till it is too late to attend to their advice. Yet with all our moral <HI>vis inertiae,</HI> or tendency to political &s;tability, the revo|lutions in opinions and manners among us Europeans, are &s;o quick and progre&s;&s;ive, that our ha&s;ty and half-formed laws and con&s;titutions are pre&s;ently left behind and out of date, or mu&s;t conform to tho&s;e man|ners and opinions they were e&s;tabli&s;hed to direct, and mu&s;t follow at a di&s;tance, in&s;tead of taking the lead in regulating our actions. Let us not however de&s;pair by the way,
<PB N="349" REF="355">
and give up the pur&s;uit of knowledge and rational &s;peculation, becau&s;e at pre&s;ent di&s;|regarded, or found in&s;ufficient for all the purpo&s;es for which they were intended or acquired. Some u&s;es will always be found for them in the wor&s;t of times, and human &s;agacity, &s;cience, and virtue, will ever be re&s;pected, and will bring &s;elf-&s;atisfaction, though otherwi&s;e reduced to be their own reward. Nor let us expect too much from human nature or &s;ociety: as it advances one way, it mu&s;t lo&s;e ground another: as men improve in knowledge and refinement, patrioti&s;m and public virtue mu&s;t dimini&s;h: as arts and wants increa&s;e, time and labour become of greater value, till at length there is little or none to &s;pare for the public, which therefore cannot then be &s;erved on di&s;intere&s;ted principles, as none can afford to work for nothing: every thing mu&s;t then be bartered or &s;old; our time, labour, our vote or intere&s;t, mu&s;t be made to turn to account.

<HEAD>To Mr. C.</HEAD>
<P>IN this country we have the advantage of a kind of living hi&s;tory, and may &s;ee the true &s;pirit and tendency of the old European &s;y&s;tems of policy and religion, from which but few nations are yet &s;uffici|ently liberated, though &s;ome good begin|nings have been made. You know how &s;eldom collective bodies of men can be brought to act on rational principles, and that they are generally governed by pre|vious habit and cu&s;tom; &s;o that it is dif|ficult to conceive how certain reforms have been brought about. Tho&s;e legi&s;lators who have appeared to &s;ucceed the be&s;t in chang|ing or improving the manners and princi|ples of their nations, may have been more indebted to fortune than fore&s;ight for their
<PB N="351" REF="357">
&s;ucce&s;s, and may have been led in&s;tead of being leaders in the crowd that was already running towards reformation. The lower the &s;tate of &s;ociety, or condition of men, the more impracticable it becomes to rai&s;e or better that condition, and it can only be done by partial and gradual means. Here, government is ever attempting magnificent and impracticable improvements, in&s;tead of following and a&s;&s;i&s;ting the fea&s;ible ef|forts of the people. If they were only to endeavour gradually to bring the tenures of this province (Galicia) <HI>los foros,</HI> into general u&s;e throughout Spain, it might do much to|wards peopling and improving the country.</P>
<P>This nation has formerly been as much tormented with internal and civil wars as any other. The people were then obliged to re&s;ort to certain &s;ituations, and live to|gether in towns, and are &s;till retained there by habit and indolence, or want of &s;uffici|ent inducement to change; &s;o that there is too large a proportion of the few people now in this penin&s;ula, contained in a &s;mall number of cities, which are &s;eparated by
<PB N="352" REF="358">
exten&s;ive de&s;erts, with a very &s;canty pro|portion of villages: and mo&s;t of tho&s;e, except Cadiz and Barcelona, are now in a poor and ruinous &s;tate, and mu&s;t probably decline &s;till lower. To re&s;tore them would require more than the country can yet for a long time afford; &s;uch as better arti&s;ts, commerce, funds, freedom, and a different race of people, who &s;hould know how to live in them. We are a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee tho&s;e who have habitations in the country for&s;aking them to live in the&s;e dirty towns: we believe it is generally owing to the ta&s;te and influence of the women in each fa|mily. I know only of one gentleman in this province, who has ta&s;te and re&s;olution to live almo&s;t entirely on his e&s;tate in the country; but he &s;uffers his wife to live in town.

habits, occupation, and finer ta&s;te, have &s;oon learned to prefer a country re&s;idence: do not imagine that the oppre&s;&s;ion of the towns, by the national government &s;eizing their funds, is any &s;troke of political wi&s;dom to drive the people to the country: tho&s;e mea&s;ures are nothing more than the blind rapacity of de&s;poti&s;m, cutting down the tree to get at the fruit. Nor would it now be ea&s;y to drive the people from the towns, where the few arts, trades, and nece&s;&s;aries of life are only to be found, while none have the &s;pirit to encourage and produce them in the country. Every part of public police, even the manner of build|ing, or of cleaning the &s;treets, is doubtle&s;s of con&s;equence; yet it is not nece&s;&s;ary to take it out of the hands of the people, on pretence of doing it for them, the u&s;ual method with arbitrary governments; but it would be right to put them in a condi|tion to do it for them&s;elves.

<P>I am plea&s;ed to find, that we at la&s;t agree as to the impo&s;&s;ibility of reforming mankind by the methods u&s;ually propo&s;ed; and that the only influence now remaining in the world &s;ufficient to re&s;tore it, is that of its monarchs: and that by educating and forming them into what they ought to be, is the only chance you have of reforming your con&s;titutions, the &s;tate, and the peo|ple. But if we con&s;ider well the difficulties attending reform, the numerous previous circum&s;tances to be prepared by time, &s;cience, fore&s;ight, and fortune, we &s;hall judge more charitably of tho&s;e princes who have failed, or have declined the ta&s;k, and may &s;ee why there have been &s;o few Lycurgu&s;es or Alfreds.</P>
<P>Some wi&s;e man has ob&s;erved, that if in|tegrity could be generally preferred, the age would mend of it&s;elf. But it is to be feared, the difficulties in that way too have increa&s;ed. While you give power and in|fluence

only to property, which is the &s;ole merit you admit of being repre&s;ented in your hou&s;e, and that but inadequately, in|tegrity and all other merits are out of the que&s;tion, and can hardly be &s;ufficiently at|tended to. You can thence only expect a government of the riche&s;t party, and the mo&s;t expen&s;ive po&s;&s;ible; &s;uch as get into power by their &s;uperior wealth. We can|not expect the riche&s;t to be the mo&s;t oeco|nomical members; and if, in granting the revenue, any means can be found &s;ecretly to reimbur&s;e them their &s;hare of the taxes, they will probably be as little &s;crupulous about increa&s;ing them, as tho&s;e who have nothing to tax. Thence you may &s;ee how difficult it is to form a legi&s;lature where a majority may not combine to fleece the na|tion and divide the &s;poils.

<P>Something more than mere integrity may be nece&s;&s;ary to reform or improve this perver&s;e wicked world. However, we know that integrity joined to &s;cience, in a liberal and amiable character, can do much; and when placed at the head of any de|partment, tho&s;e qualities become contagi|ous, and that department is infallibly ad|vanced or reformed.

Many other regulations and improvements would gradually have ari&s;en from that &s;ource, and from the joint endeavours of all; for &s;uch a head can command both the affections and abilities of all the members, whereas one of mere integrity might not be able to do either. Indeed, to do every thing effectually, and make the nation as military as it ought to be, the army, ord|nance, and militia, &s;hould all be under the &s;ame head, which ought doubtle&s;s to be a good one. It has been done, and we may hope to &s;ee it again. But as I do not pre|tend to teach government, I only give you hints of what is po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>On the&s;e principles I can agree with you, that a prince of a certain great, good, and liberal character, with &s;cience and a&s;&s;iduity, would be the only power in the world that could now po&s;&s;ibly reform
<PB N="358" REF="364">
it: the reformation you want, may be le&s;s than that required by other nations, and may neverthele&s;s be e&s;&s;ential; but nothing, I believe, can procure it you, but &s;uch a prince; and even he mu&s;t be favoured by times and circum&s;tances. To produce tho&s;e together then &s;hould be our great aim, if human &s;agacity and endeavours could do any thing towards it. I do not like your ideas always the le&s;s for being romantic and improbable: who knows how much our &s;mall efforts may contribute to &s;uch de&s;irable ends?</P>
<P>I approve much of travel, as well as &s;tudy, being part of your plan. The le&s;&s;ons to be learned here would be few, but important&mdash;To &s;ee and con&s;ider well a nation long on the decline, with the va|rious difficulties that would attend the re|forming a corrupt and weakened govern|ment and people, the &s;uperior and inter|mediate ranks of which are found to be thoroughly depraved, and rather chu&s;ing to &s;ubmit to be oppre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves than relinqui&s;h the plea&s;ure of oppre&s;&s;ing others,

and where the people prefer indolence and dependence, to liberty with indu&s;try. The po&s;&s;ibility of reforming &s;uch a nation might be doubtful, and perhaps not within the power of the greate&s;t human per&s;everance, or the longe&s;t life: but the attempt would &s;till be noble, would en&s;ure applau&s;e, and a name for ever, and might in time &s;ucceed. Let a great prince, like Philip of Macedon, take care of the education of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and in a few generations much might be done: to &s;ee here the materials, and con|template on the means of reformation, would contribute to enlighten, to in&s;pire, and invigorate the mind.</P>
<P>Great &s;ouls &s;urmount great difficulties which were before con&s;idered as invincible, and they ea&s;ily form others like them&s;elves: the laborious and middling ranks of men are &s;eldom, as you &s;uppo&s;e, &s;o far &s;poiled and enervated as to be incapable of great, and even of virtuous exertions, when the proper motives are di&s;covered and applied. On the broad ba&s;is of the real intere&s;ts of a whole people, may always be erected a con&s;titu|tion
<PB N="360" REF="366">
which would gradually &s;trengthen and improve both it&s;elf and them. To di&s;cover that intere&s;t, and that con&s;titution, would not be the greate&s;t difficulty, when once cleared of the &s;peculative refinements of law and learning; the application to prac|tice, and mode of proceeding, would be the harde&s;t ta&s;k. In every nation you may find materials to fill up your plan; keeping the one great object chiefly in view, to which all others would be relative and &s;ub|&s;ervient, and claim only their due propor|tion of time and attention. By mixing &s;tudy, re&s;idence, and travel, in proper quantities, I think, Mr. Mentor, you could not fail of &s;ome degree of &s;ucce&s;s with your Telemachus. There can at lea&s;t be no harm in plea&s;ing our&s;elves with the idea.</P>
<P>I am glad to &s;ee in your plan, that home is not to be neglected, but made the fir&s;t object. That is the foundation of the whole ideal fabric. In our pre&s;ent &s;tate, and former hi&s;tory, you will find ample materials for your purpo&s;e. From the time our an|ce&s;tors
<PB N="361" REF="367">
left the fore&s;ts in Germany, we have had many excellent parts or pieces of a con&s;titution. The&s;e, properly ar|ranged, might form a valuable collection of experimental and political wi&s;dom; from which might be formed an edifice that might be gradually completed by the wi&s;dom and experience of pa&s;t and of future times. Our dome&s;tic po|litics, and hi&s;tory of the pre&s;ent day, I con&s;ider likewi&s;e of importance, with whatever contempt &s;uch &s;tudies may be treated by &s;ome. Though manners and principles may &s;eem every where on the decline, you may comfort your&s;elves with not being near &s;o far gone in that road as your neighbours. A good head would probably &s;till find members &s;ufficient for his purpo&s;e, and would create more. Nay, I think there is yet in tho&s;e i&s;lands, more &s;en&s;e and &s;cience, more virtue and per&s;onal merits, than in many of the nations taken together.</P>
<P><PB N="362" REF="368">If the idea of a con&s;titution (for we have often had but little el&s;e, and have plumed our&s;elves upon it), if that has been the cau&s;e of &s;o much exertion and activity, and the &s;ource of our pro&s;perity, what might not be expected from a real one? Its outlines are &s;ufficiently known, and indeed already drawn and fixed; though in &s;ome parts a little defaced, and in others turned from the original direction. But if only a ma|jority of you were in earne&s;t, it might all be re&s;tored and improved, without much debate or difficulty.</P>
<P>Nor is there much rea&s;on to dread that any of your princes will prevent the real improvement of your con&s;titution (though it is highly prudent to be watchful of every po&s;&s;ible ca&s;e); and &s;till le&s;s can I conceive, with &s;ome, the po&s;&s;ibility of any regular plan of reducing the nation, by gradually corrupting, impoveri&s;hing, and dividing it; as that would be, in the end, a lo&s;s not only of time, but of every thing valuable to them&s;elves, their family, friends, and people; and every real intere&s;t they can

have, is &s;o much better &s;ecured by the con|trary conduct. Be&s;ides, the improbability of &s;ucceeding in any &s;uch plan again&s;t an informed and &s;pirited nation mu&s;t long be a &s;ufficient &s;ecurity. Their old laws, forms and habits, &s;ituation, accidents, their very caprices, would all operate again&s;t it, and might defeat it, in any &s;tage of its pro|gre&s;s, or even after its completion; for you know the &s;pirit of liberty and re&s;i&s;t|ance has always revived among us i&s;landers, even after periods of the meane&s;t and com|plete&s;t &s;ubjection. In a plan of improve|ment and reform, a prince might likewi&s;e meet with great troubles and oppo&s;ition, with powerful parties intere&s;ted in e&s;tabli&s;h|ed abu&s;es, perhaps as much as in the other; but it is to be hoped they would be more ea&s;ily overcome, and &s;ome of them might be gained. They that have power enough to do harm, can certainly do good with it, which is always ea&s;ier. Probity and virtue are ever re&s;pected in the wor&s;t of times.</P>
<P><PB N="364" REF="370">The que&s;tion then might be, to deter|mine, Which is the mo&s;t eligible plan, which is the noble&s;t ta&s;k?

He would hardly he&s;itate, but mu&s;t prefer the ta&s;k of making him&s;elf and his nation free, happy, and great, to that of making them mi&s;erable and contemptible &s;laves, and him|&s;elf unhappy and in&s;ecure. In &s;ome &s;erious matters, he might reform gradually, and in others at once, by great and deci&s;ive &s;trokes; without &s;uddenly forcing new &s;y&s;tems before they were &s;ufficiently wanted and wi&s;hed for, on the one hand; or creating and feeding of anarchy by the tedious and per|nicious contentions of jarring intere&s;ts on the other.</P>

May we not form a laborious, as well as a liberal mind of royal, as well as of plebeian extraction? Though affliction and nece&s;&s;ity are the be&s;t &s;chools, is there no other? or is the palace more exempt from the&s;e than the cottage? or is there always &s;ome uncommon degree of indolence, indulgence, &s;ome unfeeling kind of indifference, or el&s;e ungovernable pa&s;&s;ion, incident to high birth, and which mu&s;t be conquered, before they can be on a footing with other men, and made equally fit for application?

<HEAD>To Mr. F.</HEAD>
<P>SOME more &s;cattered ob&s;ervations I &s;hall collect from loo&s;e notes, and you mu&s;t excu&s;e the deficiencies of order and connection. The want of ta&s;te for a coun|try life, and for the beauties of rural &s;cenes, I con&s;ider as a radical defect in this nation as well as in France, and which has important con&s;equences both on the ornamental and u&s;eful arts: but it is generally the ca&s;e with a depre&s;&s;ed and impoveri&s;hed people; as they mu&s;t be at their ea&s;e before they can think of plea&s;urable &s;cenes, or labour long to produce them. Their blind government bids them work, and does not &s;ee that their hands are tied.</P>
<P><PB N="371" REF="377">As to the produce and &s;tate of agricul|ture, I have little el&s;e to add to what has been already &s;cattered in the letters to friends C. P. J. &amp;c. Of the natural hi&s;tory, the numerous and trifling particulars I do not pretend to give you. If we could learn to be contented with e&s;&s;entials, the time, the pains required to collect and arrange them, would be more frequently be&s;towed, and they might then be of more u&s;e than the voluminous compilations lately in fa&s;hion, which will generally be confined to the libraries of idle curio&s;ity and o&s;tentation. Suffice it to know, that Spain will produce every thing that grows in other countries under the &s;ame climate. Saffron, &s;ilk, &s;ugar, have been well cultivated in the &s;outhern parts. Potatoes were fir&s;t brought to Galicia from South America, and thence &s;pread over Europe; but they are now generally di&s;liked in Spain, even by gallegos; they call them toads meat.</P>
<P>The &s;ilk bu&s;ine&s;s was well under&s;tood and practi&s;ed by the Moors; and though
<PB N="372" REF="378">
it fled with them, its revival has been &s;ince attempted, with various, but &s;mall &s;ucce&s;s, at Granada and Valencia. This govern|ment knows not how to encourage it, nor let it alone. Prohibiting the export as a raw material, is certainly not the be&s;t way to promote the produce, and taxing the trees is &s;till wor&s;e. Under &s;uch ill-judged and variable regulations, it is &s;urpri&s;ing that any part of this bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould yet be found in Spain.</P>
<P>Among other plea&s;ant parts of their an|cient and national manners, we find the old fa&s;hioned attachment and familiarity between ma&s;ters and &s;ervants, which we &s;ee in old plays. The great hou&s;es are full of old dome&s;tics, which are con&s;idered as belonging to the family for life. Though they are too numerous, and too idle, and may be more indebted to the vanity than to the charity of the ma&s;ter for their &s;up|port; yet if he were to live more in the country on his e&s;tate, he might ea&s;ily pro|vide for them, to the benefit of all parties. They often join a little in the conver&s;ation
<PB N="373" REF="379">
while waiting at table, but always with great propriety; and the affability, kind|ne&s;s, familiarity, and politene&s;s, with which they are treated by their ma&s;ters, is very plea&s;ing, and produces warm and la&s;ting attachments, and other good effects on manners and morals. The great di&s;tance and &s;uperiority we generally a&s;&s;ume with our &s;ervants, are &s;urely beyond the proper medium, con&s;idering our laws and man|ners, and breeds animo&s;ity between the different ranks in &s;ociety. Overweaning pride and delicacy know no bounds, till checked by the good example of &s;ome &s;en&s;ible people of rank and fa&s;hion, to who&s;e more natural affability and humanity we mu&s;t look up for the remedy to this evil among the middling ranks, with whom this &s;pecies of fooli&s;h pride is more com|mon. Perhaps there mu&s;t be more di&s;tant behaviour, and jealou&s;y of &s;uperiority, in tho&s;e countries where there is an animat|ing circulation of rank and fortune, and where &s;ome are always treading on the heels of the rank next above them.</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="380">A gentleman of this province, lately from England, and who had been there before, &s;ays, that he does not find the Engli&s;h nation &s;o much improved as he expected. The upper ranks, he thinks, more retired, proud, &s;elfi&s;h, and un&s;ocial, than formerly; for&s;aking their old ho&s;pi|table and popular manners; though per|haps more refined, and extracting, as it were, the e&s;&s;ence of every thing, to enjoy it among them&s;elves. The lower ranks, he finds, more ragged, drunken, debauch|ed, at lea&s;t in the great towns, and not &s;o cleanly as twelve and twenty years ago; but believes, that &s;ome of the middling ranks, and the manufacturing counties, are improved. Let us hope that part of the difference may proceed from the change that twenty years may have produced in his mind. However, the ob&s;ervations of no travellers de&s;erve more attention than tho&s;e of learned Spaniards, &s;uch as he; and a few of his remarks are worth all the volumes that the French have written about us, except Voltaire. I wi&s;h the Spaniards in general were not quite &s;o &s;ore, and &s;o

<P>As to their population, exports, and other elements of political arithmetic which you want; I can add but few facts to the general ideas already mentioned, nor can I point out any certain method of obtain|ing them, in a country where tho&s;e matters are yet but little under&s;tood or con&s;idered. Campomanes can probably give you the mo&s;t, and they may afterwards be &s;ome|what corrected at their different ports among the foreign merchants.

<P>Contemplating on this old and worn-down nation &s;ugge&s;ts an opinion that every government or &s;ociety requires certain changes or innovations from time to time, in order to re&s;tore activity, and awaken men from a kind of lethargy, towards which old in&s;titutions have a gradual ten|dency. But to attempt the recovery of this nation is probably now too late. On recapitulating the numerous requi&s;ites ne|ce&s;&s;ary to her re&s;toration, we may con|clude, that &s;he cannot ri&s;e again to her former &s;trength and greatne&s;s till &s;o many changes are brought about, as to make &s;uch recovery very di&s;tant and improbable. She cannot certainly ri&s;e till &s;he is freed from all &s;ubjection to France, and perhaps not till after &s;everal wars with her rival power; nor till her government is entirely reformed, or rather changed, and differ|ently con&s;tituted on the old model with

&s;ome improvements; nor till agriculture can flouri&s;h, for which purpo&s;e her laws of tenures and inheritance, her religion, colonies, maxims of commerce, manners, as well as government, mu&s;t all undergo con&s;iderable changes; not till they have roads, inland navigation, and commerce, to pay for them; nor till their plans of finance are quite reformed, their taxes better regulated, laid, and levied, &s;o as to find money and credit for public expences, for nece&s;&s;ary improvements, and longer wars; and not till the <HI>alcavala,</HI> in parti|cular, be totally aboli&s;hed. Not till the nobility live more in the country, and cul|tivate their e&s;tates, or rather parcel them out on proper lea&s;es, or <HI>&s;oros,</HI> for others to cultivate, and &s;ell or di&s;po&s;e of them as they plea&s;e <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>You would be &s;urpri&s;ed at the &s;mallne&s;s of the net ren|tal of &s;ome of the very exten&s;ive e&s;tates in this country.

Not till they are better qualified for war by di&s;cipline, experience, indu&s;try, population. In &s;hort, I believe nothing can re&s;tore her, without fir&s;t a wi&s;e and free con&s;titution of government, which without doubt is omnipotent. But all this is quite improbable, and almo&s;t out of &s;ight: hence it is perhaps better for you to have her as a known enemy than as a burden|&s;ome friend; at lea&s;t till &s;he totally change her &s;y&s;tem and alliances.

No two nations can be much better &s;ituated for &s;uch mutual be|nefits and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and for the clo&s;e&s;t connections. The produce of the one

country, and the manufactories of the other, might be made to promote and increa&s;e both to a great extent; and probably in no other way could Spain make her &s;ubjects cultivators, and increa&s;e her natural productions to &s;o great a degree.</P>
<P>Had this nation been ble&s;&s;ed with &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors worthy of Ferdinand and I&s;abella, equal, or &s;imilar to them in wi&s;dom and knowledge of the country and its con&s;titu|tion, ready to adopt the di&s;coveries of the age as they ro&s;e, and qualified to &s;econd the di&s;po&s;itions which then appeared in the nation towards every &s;pecies of improve|ment, Spain might &s;till have been the fir&s;t nation in Europe. Had Charles V. for|tunately been brought up in the country, or had he only con&s;ulted Cardinal Ximenes, and &s;ome others of the &s;en&s;ible and liberal Spaniards of tho&s;e days, he might thence have adopted or improved upon the ideas and maxims of tho&s;e his excellent prede|ce&s;&s;ors: but he came full fraught with his German ideas of government, with Flemi&s;h

and Au&s;trian friends and prejudices, which in time bla&s;ted the flowers, and even the root, of all the Spani&s;h improvements, in the abolition of the then growing con&s;titu|tion of their government; and they mu&s;t probably continue to decline till it is planted again. The reign of Ferdinand and I&s;a|bella is the period of Spani&s;h hi&s;tory, notwith&s;tanding the bigotry and errors of the times, the mo&s;t de&s;erving atten|tion.

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XXXV.</HI> Military and Geographical Ob&s;ervations. Conclu&s;ion.</HEAD>
<HEAD>To Mr. A. J.</HEAD>
<P>THE few military ob&s;ervations I wi&s;h to give you here, I &s;hall endeavour to abridge. In their military affairs, there is little remarkable: they keep following the re&s;t of Europe, and particularly the French, though at a di&s;tance; they con|form at la&s;t, though &s;o &s;lowly that they are left behind. Till this reign there has been but little alteration &s;ince Philip V. frenchified their little army: and the few late regulations are of &s;mall importance.</P>
<P>The people have &s;till &s;ome of the quali|ties e&s;&s;ential to the formation of good troops: they are naturally brave, &s;teady, temperate, patient, of &s;trong nerves, and
<PB N="385" REF="391">
very fit for per&s;evering enterprize: but, perhaps cruel, vindictive, violent, when under the influence of &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, to which they are &s;ubject with all their ap|parent plegma: &s;o that the <HI>fort</HI> of their character is not perhaps now &s;o <HI>&agrave;-propos</HI> to the times, nor to the pre&s;ent mode of war as it was formerly; and certain qualities which might then have been of u&s;e, or at lea&s;t of no impediment, may not be now &s;o well adapted to the promptitude, obedi|ence, and activity, of modern di&s;cipline: at times, &s;ullen, indolent, proud, ob&s;tinate, I &s;hould apprehend a mutinous &s;pirit on &s;ome important occa&s;ions: &s;o that we may doubt their &s;oon making again the figure in war which they have done formerly, in other times and manners: at lea&s;t, not without excellent officers, an active war, and good di&s;cipline, which are not likely to happen &s;oon: but if they &s;hould happen, and their government, their population im|prove, their good qualities would be &s;een to predominate, and they might again be|come the fir&s;t troops in the world. Their hor&s;e might &s;oon be made excellent, if well
<PB N="386" REF="392">
appointed and commanded: they would make up in velocity what they want in weight, and might be the fir&s;t and mo&s;t u&s;eful cavalry in Europe. But their fine breed of hor&s;es has declined, and cannot, I believe, be well re&s;tored, but with agri|culture and the other arts.</P>
<P>They have attempted a method and re|gularity in recruiting their army, which, with &s;ome improvement, might an&s;wer better for us than for them. viz. each corps to be recruited from the province or di&s;trict from whence it is named, and each fifth man taken when wanted. If they were to be more frequently quartered in their re&s;pective di&s;tricts, and a certain local <HI>e&s;prit de corps,</HI> and a connection kept up, it might have more good effects, and fewer bad. With us, while under parliamentary and provin|cial control, and if directed by a really military government; the whole body of the people formed into a militia, which &s;hould &s;upply the army with men for five or &s;even years &s;ervice each; the army to be employed in peace on u&s;eful public works;
<PB N="387" REF="393">
&s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;hment might make us a mi|litary nation. Though their army here, and this mode of recruiting, tend to de|populate the country which can ill bear it, and to de&s;troy indu&s;try where there is al|ready &s;o little, the&s;e defects would &s;oon be &s;upplied by a good government: but that &s;ource, and all others, are here de|ficient.</P>
<P>From the two oppo&s;ite extremities of this kingdom, Catalonia and the northern provinces, might be formed excellent regi|ments: but you know they have had no wars of late &s;ufficient to form troops, and can have but few great officers: tho&s;e who &s;erved in Italy are mo&s;tly worn out; and we may doubt of their having now among them much of that military enthu&s;ia&s;m and activity of mind nece&s;&s;ary to produce more. We know they have &s;till, among the field officers, &s;ome military &s;pirits, like mo&s;t other nations; but it would require a war of &s;ome length and action to form a &s;ufficient number.</P>
<P><PB N="388" REF="394">War, if it could be well regulated, and kept within bounds, &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to a nation at certain intervals; were it only to call forth &s;ome exertions in our nature, which are otherwi&s;e lo&s;t, and to prevent the increa&s;ing evil effects of luxury, civi|lization, and repo&s;e, which gradually lead to timid indolent habits, to a &s;hamele&s;s dread of death, and at la&s;t, of every tri|fling danger and inconvenience. War is likewi&s;e &s;o much le&s;s tremendous in fact, than to the fancy, that it ought perhaps to be &s;een &s;ometimes by nations, and fre|quently by all the individuals of the profe&s;&s;ion: to them both practice and &s;cience are nece&s;&s;ary. Theory, without experience, can never &s;uffice to form a great officer, though the only foundation on which &s;uch an important character can be e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>A whole nation formed to war, and another with only an army &s;o formed, would be found very different in &s;trength, dignity, and exertion: but few &s;eem yet to con&s;ider the&s;e things properly, except the Swi&s;s. I &s;uppo&s;e nothing but actual in|va&s;ion
<PB N="389" REF="395">
can ever prevail on us i&s;landers to regulate our&s;elves for war. We feel &s;o &s;e|cure, &s;urrounded by the &s;ea, and depend|ing on the precarious defence of fleets, that we are apt to relax into military negli|gence during peace: hence our wars be|come &s;o expen&s;ive, and &s;o badly managed, e&s;pecially at the beginning; and hence &s;o few great officers have been or can be pro|duced among us.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t modern governments have imbibed a timid and jealous policy, and dread granting to the people military arms and regulations, which would have &s;o many beneficial effects on manners, police, and render them &s;o much more orderly and manageable; and not more, but le&s;s danger|ous to the &s;tate, or public&mdash;to them&s;elves. Since the people, in mo&s;t countries, have been di&s;armed, under the in&s;idious idea of enjoying their ea&s;e, and only paying for their defence, and have been thereby de|livered over defencele&s;s into the power of their defenders, who thence become a &s;eparate, and the wor&s;t, part of &s;ociety,
<PB N="390" REF="396">
the be&s;t government will be known by re|&s;toring to the people their importance, with the u&s;e of their arms, and regulating them accordingly. If their time be now totally filled up in &s;upporting life by &s;upplying the luxuries of the great, and the follies of the &s;tate, let them lay their arms by their &s;ide, till they can find time to learn their u&s;e, which their governments, when wi&s;e, will &s;oon find for them; and will thereby pre|vent war.</P>
<P>I can conceive a corps or little army, when not too exclu&s;ively military, as in time of peace, to be &s;o con&s;tituted as to form a tolerable model for civil &s;ociety. Civil and military in&s;titutions &s;hould be brought nearer and more &s;imilar to each other: both are improved by attending to the &s;maller divi&s;ions of men, as to &s;quads, me&s;&s;es, tythings, as wi&s;ely done of old by Alfred, and lately by the be&s;t officers. The failure and defects of the feudal &s;y&s;tem &s;hould not di&s;courage us from attempting other &s;imilar in&s;titutions with improve|ments: as that of a general circulating mi|litia,
<PB N="391" REF="397">
from which a &s;mall but active &s;tanding army might be con&s;tantly &s;upplied; and by the men returning frequently into &s;ociety, the true military &s;pirit might be retained. In the &s;ubdivi&s;ions and e&s;tabli&s;hment of an army, &s;omething like the Roman legion we &s;hould con&s;ider as the be&s;t pattern; and we &s;hould give tho&s;e principles a fair trial before we attempt to improve upon them. Our pre&s;ent corps or regiment are certainly too &s;mall and helple&s;s little handfuls of men, with few re&s;ources. In &s;ome of the mili|tary colonies of the Romans, was probably e&s;tabli&s;hed the proper junction of the civil and military life: the detail of &s;ome of the&s;e might be well worth the inve&s;tiga|tion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It is hoped our good friend General Melville will favour the world with an account of &s;ome of the many curious and important parts of the Roman methods and in&s;titutions, which he has di&s;covered with &s;uch great pains and ingenuity.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>If you will not all learn, as you ought, to fight by land, it is to be wi&s;hed you would be attentive to the con&s;tant improve|ment of your navy. You &s;eemed there,
<PB N="392" REF="398">
for a while, to forget that every thing is progre&s;&s;ive and nothing &s;tationary in this world. Your navy &s;hould be always im|proving, always re&s;pectable, and in great readine&s;s, even during peace; with 10,000 marines, at lea&s;t, commanded and well di&s;ciplined by your &s;ea officers, who would thence become more military. You &s;hould likewi&s;e e&s;tabli&s;h the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible &s;chools for con&s;truction, where all theory and ma|thematics &s;hould be taught and rendered more common, in addition to your already excellent practical knowledge: and from thence, &s;hould be appointed &s;ome good en|gineers for your ports and dock-yards. Your warrant officers likewi&s;e, ma&s;ters, gunners, &s;choolma&s;ters, in great numbers, &s;hould be kept up and employed, and nur&s;eries of &s;uch men provided, during peace. Though every thing cannot be kept in readine&s;s for war, at the public ex|pence, the &s;ources whence they are to pro|ceed &s;hould &s;urely be attended to, and &s;ome provi&s;ion be made of the mo&s;t nece&s;|&s;ary parts before they are wanted, as a foundation to build upon.</P>
<P><PB N="393" REF="399">Though Spain, among many other ad|vantages of &s;ituation, is defended by an excellent land frontier, the Pyren&eacute;es; yet it has now many weak &s;ides, and is even comparatively weak on this its &s;tronge&s;t &s;ide. Their friends, the French, being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the principal pa&s;&s;es, they are reduced to means of defence which would be quite in&s;ufficient, e&s;pecially with their naval inferiority. Their pre&s;ent frontier places, as Figueras, Fonterabia, &amp;c. might be ea&s;ily ma&s;ked, and left behind without much ri&s;k, by an army from France, as it could &s;o readily be &s;upplied by &s;ea, &s;ome|times by a voyage only of a few leagues. The weakne&s;&s;es of their three principal king's ports, they are at great pains to con|ceal by &s;uch &s;upercilious precautions, as are quite unu&s;ual, and incompatible with com|mon commercial intercour&s;e. But they will probably yet long remain the mo&s;t anti-commercial nation in Europe, and their public councils continue to counteract all the advantages for trade and pro&s;perity, which nature has &s;o lavi&s;hly be&s;towed on the country. Even their be&s;t maxims and
<PB N="394" REF="400">
regulations now in meditation, civil, eccle|&s;ia&s;tical, commercial, &amp;c. will prove, I doubt, only &s;o many attempts to reconcile irreconcilable contradictions, while the government remains of &s;o bad a model and con&s;truction. I may be mi&s;taken; but the more I contemplate on this na|tion, the more I am convinced it can never ri&s;e again, but by a clo&s;er connection with England.</P>
<P>Many more rea&s;ons, for &s;ome of the&s;e perhaps bold, though well con&s;idered, opi|nions might be found than I have yet al|leged to you; but as we are not attempt|ing to open their eyes, which would be dif|ficult, and yours do not want it, I &s;hall not trouble you, nor my&s;elf, any longer with &s;uch &s;peculations.</P>
<P>From the memorandums of other va|rious journies through other parts of Spain, little more appears fit to be tran&s;|mitted in this way. I am &s;orry to find &s;ome late excur&s;ions not near &s;o agree|able as &s;uch u&s;ed formerly to be, when you may remember our &s;allying forth in que&s;t
<PB N="395" REF="401">
of new objects, of difficulties and adven|tures. A few years, and a &s;mall change of circum&s;tances, make a great difference in a man's life, ta&s;te, and habits. How|ever, I think the mo&s;t unplea&s;ant journey, or campaign, is generally remembered with plea&s;ure: the wor&s;t parts are gilded over, or di&s;appear, and the plea&s;ant are beauti|fied by ab&s;ence and recollection.</P>
<P>To acquire a general and military idea of a country, I think the rivers are the leading features fir&s;t to be examined; and then the country between them, fir&s;t from maps, and then from cho&s;en heights, ob|&s;erving, at the &s;ame time, the cour&s;e of the mountains, and their pa&s;&s;es. The cour&s;e of rivers, and ranges of mountains, will thence be &s;een to divide a country commonly into a few large di&s;tricts, and beginning thus with general ideas or out|lines, the particulars are more ea&s;ily filled up, and a clear idea of the whole is &s;ooner obtained, than by attempting to be too par|ticular at fir&s;t; a common fault with little military minds, and many others. In what|ever
<PB N="396" REF="402">
country you travel, you &s;hould never forget your profe&s;&s;ion. The <HI>coup d'oeil militaire, ou geographique,</HI> which are &s;imilar, may certainly be acquired or communicat|ed. Frederic, I dare &s;ay, could readily give you &s;ome of his rapid and general ideas on that &s;ubject. I hope you will be able to &s;ee him before he leaves this world. He is worth going far to &s;ee. You may, from him, catch ideas and fire enough to la&s;t you a life-time, and make you a great &s;oldier. But I doubt he is not &s;o much of a Lycurgus as an Alexander. I of|ten wi&s;h he had travelled to England. Yet <HI>&agrave;-propos</HI> to Alexander, I often think, that if he had lived to &s;ettle &s;omewhere on the Euphrates, and had once got Ari&s;totle, and others of the Greek &s;ages about him, he would have reformed, and got the better of his follies, and might have proved the greate&s;t legi&s;lator, as well as the greate&s;t general, that ever lived; and would have been the only &s;overeign, from the fir&s;t Cyrus down to the pre&s;ent time, fit to re|form and improve A&s;ia, its people, man|ners, and modes of government. You &s;ee
<PB N="397" REF="403">
the immen&s;e importance of education. Philip was right, and mu&s;t have had a great mind, in perceiving the con&s;equence of having &s;uch a ma&s;ter as Ari&s;totle for his &s;on. But as to Germany, though fertile in great officers, I fear it is not quite the &s;oil to produce great lawgivers. For that rare&s;t of all characters, we mu&s;t not yet look to the north: indeed it is hard to &s;ay where to look for &s;uch an uncommon being.</P>
<P>Some minds are &s;ynthetically, and others analytically, di&s;po&s;ed: tho&s;e begin naturally from general principles, and thence de|&s;cend ea&s;ily and rapidly through all the con&s;equences: the others, from particulars, creep &s;lowly up towards the general prin|ciples; and though they may not get &s;o far, are often firmer and &s;urer than the others as far as they go. Both are u&s;eful when properly employed. The one, being the mo&s;t common, is of great and daily u&s;e; the other, more rarely wanted and produced, is only required on certain great occa&s;ions, and is fitter to direct the whole than to execute a part of it. An Euclid, a Newton, a Frederic, for example, in
<PB N="398" REF="404">
order to examine a country, would pro|bably go to &s;ome of the higher parts fir&s;t, to acquire a general and connected idea or plan of the whole, and thence de&s;cend to examine particulars, by &s;ome &s;y&s;tem al|ready formed on the general view. He who knows how to di&s;tingui&s;h and employ tho&s;e different talents may govern the world.</P>
<P>Your method of collecting the maps, publi&s;hed in their re&s;pective countries, is a very good way. I wi&s;h D'Anville, or &s;ome|body el&s;e, would e&s;tabli&s;h a good and la&s;t|ing geographical &s;chool for all the execu|tive parts. Rivers are of &s;uch con&s;equence in the world, that it &s;hould perhaps be di|vided, and its parts di&s;tingui&s;hed and de|nominated, by them, as it is fertilized, and has probably been peopled, by their means. A map that had little more than all the &s;treams well traced, di&s;tingui&s;hing tho&s;e that are dry in &s;ummer, would &s;hew the nature of a country better than all the other parts of geographical engraving, which we take &s;o much pains about, and by which we only blacken and confu&s;e our charts, without gaining any proportional
<PB N="399" REF="405">
advantage in di&s;tinct or u&s;eful ideas. By con&s;idering the &s;treams of my almo&s;t white map, wherein I can legibly mark what I plea&s;e, and a&s;king a few que&s;tions of an inhabitant or a traveller, we &s;hall be able to gain better general notions of the ri&s;e and make of the country, for military and other purpo&s;es, and much &s;ooner than you by all your black maps and long de&s;crip|tions.</P>
<P>Think not that I tell you all of what might be ob&s;erved of the&s;e countries where I pa&s;s, or even where I re&s;ide: I deal in generals, and do not mean to give you half even of tho&s;e things that can be told; and you know there are many incom|municable ideas which you mu&s;t take the trouble to go for, as they cannot be brought nor &s;ent to you; a circum&s;tance which travellers are not always aware of. Many ob&s;ervations I hope will here occur to you, which may have e&s;caped us all. Travelling oftener on bu&s;ine&s;s than from curio&s;ity, we have not always made a point of &s;eeing every thing. Your method of taking me|morandums of what &s;hould be &s;een is very

good: but you will find, that the curio&s;ity mu&s;t be uncommonly powerful that lets nothing e&s;cape in this country.

<P>WE now proceed from Galicia to Portugal, a country about which I &s;hall not probably have much that is new to tell you; as, by our commerce and alliance with this nation, many of our countrymen are become pretty well ac|quainted with it, and you may meet with people in London, who can give you better information than my&s;elf on the &s;ubject; &s;o that a few general ob&s;ervations and reflec|tions,
<PB N="402" REF="408">
as they occur, may appear to me &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>We were forced, by an exce&s;s of Spani&s;h caution, to depart before the time we intend|ed, and to make a circuit by the mo&s;t difficult paths and mountains, with the children, &s;ometimes in litters, and at others in carts; at night, &s;ome wretched hovel to receive us, and which did not always afford even &s;traw to &s;leep on: but children are excellent tra|vellers; hard&s;hips are diver&s;ion to them.</P>
<P>In the Spani&s;h &s;ervice, the foreigners are more rigid and over-loyal than the natives. It has been remarked, that <HI>renegades</HI> are the greate&s;t zealots. In a country with any preten&s;ions to civilization, it is hardly po&s;&s;ible to be treated with more rudene&s;s and obduracy than we have been by one of tho&s;e gentlemen, a native of Ireland, who happened to command at St. Jago. How|ever, we are indebted to him for the enjoy|ment of many delightful &s;cenes, with which tho&s;e mountains in Galicia and the north of Portugal abound; frequently cut by narrow vales, little rapid &s;treams, with a variety of trees, and &s;ome cottages. In
<PB N="403" REF="409">
the more direct road which I went before, nearer the coa&s;t, there are &s;everal vallies rather &s;pacious and rich; as that of Padron, of Pontivedra, Tuy. Wherever you &s;ee a river in the map of this country, you may &s;uppo&s;e a vale full of beauties. We found &s;everal of the poor ragged fi&s;hermen on that coa&s;t, who had been farmers, but were forced to abandon the cultivation of their lands, though their own property, becau&s;e they found it was only working for the king, the curate, and the convent; you may thence judge of the &s;tate of agricul|ture, of property, church, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Vigo is a &s;pacious inlet of the &s;ea, and a noble port, and might be ea&s;ily made much better. Its vicinity to Portugal being con&s;idered by the Spani&s;h government as an objection to making it a king's port, is a motive &s;carcely more honourable than that of a corps of Jews, which was once formed for the Turki&s;h &s;ervice; but when ready to march, they begged for a guard to pro|tect them from the populace. Spain would perhaps protect her&s;elf, if &s;he could, by di&s;tance and de&s;olation. The over-caution
<PB N="404" REF="410">
of her councils has not unfrequently car|ried her beyond the u&s;ual limits of political ab&s;urdity, and &s;ometimes to tho&s;e of cru|elty. Had &s;he been placed in a great con|tinent, &s;he might probably have de&s;olated the countries around her for defence, like &s;ome other great barbarous monarchies. The &s;ame barbarian motive is given in this country (Portugal) for not making roads. The want of military &s;cience and di&s;cipline is ever the &s;ource of timidity, and of cau|tions fooli&s;h or inadequate, like the bird that hides only its head, and thinks it&s;elf &s;afe. As the military arts declined, men prepared for war by ca&s;ing them&s;elves up in armour to be &s;mothered, or by &s;hutting them&s;elves up in inacce&s;&s;ible rocks and ca&s;tles to be &s;tarved. Nations have not en|tirely thrown off their ignorance with their armour. Only a few &s;eem yet to know, that national &s;trength con&s;i&s;ts in an active and moving force, and that the &s;afe&s;t &s;tate of defence is the being always in readine&s;s to attack. The change from the feudal militia, to the pre&s;ent mode of &s;tanding armies, was &s;low and awkward: the former was given up before the other was ready;
<PB N="405" REF="411">
all was for a time confu&s;ion, and ignorance of the true military principles. We have not probably any where adopted the be&s;t defen&s;ive e&s;tabli&s;hments for our pre&s;ent manners and &s;tate of &s;ociety. I believe I mentioned my opinion of the be&s;t mode of military power and defence for our country. To reconcile the oppo&s;ing difficulties that attend the choice of &s;ome of the be&s;t of tho&s;e mea&s;ures, is one of the mo&s;t import|ant political problems that remains yet to be &s;olved by practice.</P>
<P>Coming from Spain, by this route, Por|tugal &s;eems to have the advantage, at lea&s;t in the&s;e northern parts of it. Others, who come from Madrid to Li&s;bon, on com|paring the two nations, do not, I ob&s;erve, conceive &s;uch advantageous opinions of this: but in that route they pa&s;s through Alentejo, and &s;ome of the mo&s;t barren parts of this kingdom. Here we pre&s;ently perceive marks of greater indu&s;try and plenty than in Spain; better markets, farmers, cattle, ploughs, &s;ome fences, lime and other manures; more expert carpen|ters and other nece&s;&s;ary trades; better
<PB N="406" REF="412">
linen, leather, hats, more dre&s;s and clean|line&s;s on holidays, but not in their hou&s;es; there they are &s;till equally, or more dirty and carele&s;s, and remarkably indifferent about beds: a Portugue&s;e, &s;till more than a Spa|niard, is accu&s;tomed to &s;leep any where. <HI>Para ellos, to da la calle es cama.</HI> But here more of the rural ta&s;te for country hou&s;es appears, more &s;kill and indu&s;try in convey|ing water, and in the laying out and ma|nagement of their grounds: and this ta&s;te and &s;tyle of improvement &s;eem to be of old &s;tanding, and to have been formerly better than now: there are indications of former &s;cience, from which &s;ome of the practice &s;till remains: their hi&s;tory accounts for it. About the time of their great di&s;|coveries and e&s;tabli&s;hments in the ea&s;t, you know, they were a learned and enterpri&s;|ing nation, and were guided by the fir&s;t royal family of philo&s;ophers that the world had &s;een for a long time before: and they have probably contributed more towards the improvement of mankind than any other princes in modern hi&s;tory, by en|couraging mathematical and nautical know|ledge, and promoting a &s;pirit of re&s;earch
<PB N="407" REF="413">
and di&s;covery, which, from them, began to &s;pread over Europe. Much &s;cience and good &s;en&s;e appear in many of their e&s;ta|bli&s;hments and operations, and in the &s;pirit with which Prince Henry placed his academy at Cape St. Vincent's, in view of the ocean which he meant to explore. Their money weights and mea&s;ures, in&s;ti|tuted then, &s;hew more knowledge of true principles than is yet to be met with in any other government. Like us at pre&s;ent, they made various re&s;earches and experi|ments to di&s;cover an univer&s;al &s;tandard mea&s;ure; and after all, they wi&s;ely follow|ed the Greeks and Romans; as lately di&s;|covered by our good con&s;ul Whitehead here, together with many other intere&s;t|ing particulars concerning tho&s;e re&s;pectable princes, which we hope he will communi|cate to the world.</P>
<P>The arts generally advance together, and it appears, that agriculture then flouri&s;hed here with the re&s;t. In many places, the people are &s;till in the habits of leading water a great way, along the &s;ides of the hills, for the advantage of watering
<PB N="408" REF="414">
a great extent of country below; or &s;ome|times to bring it to a private hou&s;e or e&s;tate. This, with their early methods of di&s;tributing it in towns, evince a know|ledge of hydro&s;tatics, and of mathematical principles, which did not appear in public any where el&s;e for a long time after. And there are remains of country &s;eats and im|provements, &s;ufficient to &s;hew that the nobility had then a ta&s;te for a country life, and encouraged the u&s;eful arts and pro&s;pe|rity around them.</P>
<P>The <HI>water finders</HI> form a &s;eparate trade or profe&s;&s;ion in this country. They pre|tend to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uperior gifts or in&s;tincts, and to be a di&s;tinct race, and by means of a few <HI>hocus pocus</HI> tricks, contrive to make a great my&s;tery of their profe&s;&s;ion. I be|lieve it may be di&s;covered, by a watchful attention, pretty nearly where to dig for water, from various indications of nature; as from the make or fall of the grounds, the &s;tate of vegetation, the vi&s;ible evapora|tion, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="409" REF="415">This little kingdom po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es two very con&s;iderable advantages, the one for na|tional &s;trength, and the other for com|merce; its land frontier, and its &s;ea coa&s;t; the fir&s;t is defen&s;ible by means of &s;ome &s;kill and exertion, and not &s;o &s;trong by na|ture as to induce its defenders to &s;leep; and the coa&s;t &s;eems to invite the whole world to trade with them, by its &s;ituation, its beauties, ports, and produce.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER II.</HI> Form, &amp;c. of Portugal. Vegetable and animal Life. Character. Count la Lippe.</HEAD>
<P>I INTENDED to have begun my very brief account of this country, by giving you &s;ome general idea of its make or form; but I find it more difficult than I expected. I believe I mentioned to you, or friend C., the coa&s;t of this whole penin&s;ula being like a lace &s;et round an old garment, and &s;uch is probably the ca&s;e with Africa, Arabia, and all the penin&s;ulas and con|tinents of the world. This coa&s;t, from Cape Fini&s;terre to Cape St. Vincent's, is however a very good and principal part of our lace. You &s;ee in the map the importance of its geographical &s;ituation; open to the great ocean where the &s;hips of all nations pa&s;s, containing the mouths, and the be&s;t parts of the be&s;t rivers of the penin&s;ula; the countries on their banks are
<PB N="411" REF="417">
the mo&s;t fertile and delightful, and very different from the Spani&s;h plains, which tho&s;e rivers &s;eem to water without effect; but they enrich and beautify the mountains of Portugal, and might &s;till be made to do both more effectually. To the &s;outh, this country varies into larger divi&s;ions, and more of them &s;andy and barren. Mo&s;t of Alentejo &s;eems a continuation of the great Spani&s;h plain of E&s;tremadura or Guadiana, which interrupt a little the roughne&s;s and mountains of their frontier; but Sierra Morena pre&s;ently ri&s;es again in another direction, terminating in Cape St. Vincent, its &s;kirts and vallies forming the beautiful little country of Algarve. You may ob|&s;erve how the river Guadiana, turning &s;uddenly to the left at Badajos, &s;eems to force its way through the range of Sierra Morena, with immen&s;e precipices for its banks. If it had gone &s;treight forward to the &s;ea, &s;omewhere to the &s;outh of St. Ubal, as we &s;hould naturally expect in fol|lowing its cour&s;e to Badajos, the great arid plains of Alentejo might have been bene|fited by it.</P>
<P><PB N="412" REF="418">In this penin&s;ula, there &s;eem to be dif|ferent climates in the &s;ame latitude, which is often the ca&s;e on our globe. The great Spani&s;h plains, and the Portugue&s;e hills and vallies, though under the &s;ame paral|lels, &s;hew &s;ome remarkable differences in &s;oils, plants, animals, and the general characters of animal life. This is more ob&s;ervable in Indo&s;tan, South America, &amp;c. The&s;e Portugue&s;e mountains, fir&s;t by their ri&s;e, and then by their gradual de|&s;cent into the Atlantic, may be &s;aid at once to form the country, and to divide and defend it from Spain. If you dabble in natural hi&s;tory, chu&s;e the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential and important parts, and leave the minutiae to others. You cannot otherwi&s;e be great as a &s;oldier and a &s;enator, who ought to know every thing, and be engro&s;&s;ed by no|thing. I wi&s;h you to begin every &s;ubject &s;ynthetically from general principles, like Euclid, &amp;c. Though &s;ome of you Engli&s;h affect to de&s;pi&s;e Buffon, I like his method, and his ideas.</P>
<P>We may now hope to know the relative heights of di&s;tant countries, if important,
<PB N="413" REF="419">
by means of barometers. At General Elliot's de&s;ire, I have ju&s;t been mea&s;uring &s;ome of the heights of Gibraltar by Ram&s;|den's portable barometers: I believe the method may be made to an&s;wer generally well, by the help of Colonel Roy's correc|tions, which may be yet farther improved by experiment, in allowing for heat. I believe the plains of Ca&s;tile, for example, will be found to be higher than generally thought, above the &s;ea, and above tho&s;e in France. The plain of Granada is of a con&s;iderable and obvious height, which might be ea&s;ily mea&s;ured. Here, if we con&s;ider the length and fall of this river Douro, and that the water that now pa&s;&s;es my window may come from beyond Bur|gos, Soria, or Avila, and, after many windings and rapids, has gone above two hundred leagues, allowing only ten feet fall <HI>per</HI> league, gives two thou&s;and feet height for the great plains of Old Ca&s;tile. Their great height, with the nature of the &s;oil and &s;trata, may be among the cau&s;es of their drought.</P>
<P><PB N="414" REF="420">Many of the Portugue&s;e vallies are highly productive and luxuriant: and yet I think the productions of this, and of &s;everal other warmer countries, are not &s;o rich and nutritive as they appear, and that mo&s;t of the fruits, if we except the grape and orange, &s;hew better than they are in reality: they &s;eem to me often weak and watery, as if not &s;ufficiently concocted, or nutritive; and as if forced up in a hurry by &s;un and water, without &s;ufficient time and natural cultivation. And I think &s;ome|thing &s;imilar is ob&s;ervable both in vegetable and animal life here. The men, though often of a good &s;quare make, and active appearance, and have many other good qualities as men and &s;oldiers, yet few of them are capable of any great and continued exertions of &s;trength, re&s;olution, or per&s;everance. There is a kind of female levity, weakne&s;s, and &s;en&s;ibility of character, which renders them more &s;ubject to &s;udden fits of pa&s;&s;ion than to la&s;ting habits.&mdash;Peculiarly di&s;po&s;ed to love and devotion;&mdash;with more &s;en&s;ibility than wi&s;dom;&mdash;<HI>pocos y locos,</HI> the Spaniards &s;ay of them;&mdash;they re&s;emble the French in
<PB N="415" REF="421">
many ways, and are very different from the Spaniards. I believe we rather con|found the&s;e two neighbouring nations, and fancy a character of both which &s;uits neither.</P>
<P>Though the &s;ame kind of government and religion, a &s;imilarity of manners and opinions, may have brought them to an apparent re&s;emblance in the eyes of &s;tran|gers; yet on examination, they are obvi|ou&s;ly of a different race and character. The Portugue&s;e is naturally the mo&s;t docile and complai&s;ant of all creatures, and the Spaniard the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate: the one &s;eems to be moved by a kind of volatile feminine &s;pirit of &s;en&s;ibility, and the other by one of a nature more ma&s;culine, &s;teady, ob|durate, and determined: the one ob&s;e|quious, obedient <HI>muy rendido ha&s;ta derri|tir&s;e;</HI> his manner and language the mo&s;t feeling and <HI>carino&s;a;</HI> generally de&s;irous to plea&s;e, ready enough to learn and receive impre&s;&s;ions, and may be formed to what you de&s;ire; though, by turns, equally carele&s;s and indolent, weak, changeable, &s;uper&s;titious; he forgets &s;ooner than he
<PB N="416" REF="422">
had learned. Whereas the Spaniard is ever the &s;ame proud, ob&s;tinate, lazy, but manly character, and will not ea&s;ily receive or fol|low any impre&s;&s;ions or motives but his own: by his religion and loyalty he has been en&s;laved, which by any other means would have been very difficult: with a high &s;en&s;ibility, and a determined character, he may be led to be vindictive and cruel; with &s;trong nerves, and a per&s;evering mind, he may be very fit for de&s;perate enterprize and conque&s;t. But as &s;uch qualities are not now the chief requi&s;ites in the character of a &s;oldier, nor &s;o well adapted to the ready obedience and activity of modern di&s;cipline, I would perhaps now rather chu&s;e to recruit in Portugal than in Spain. Indeed, we have lately &s;een a great officer, Count de la Lippe, form a very good little army of the&s;e people, in le&s;s time than could pro|bably have been done with the people of almo&s;t any other nation. But they will &s;oon lo&s;e their be&s;t habits and di&s;cipline, if the lea&s;t neglected, and will relap&s;e into their u&s;ual &s;loth and indolence, of which there is already too much appearance: al|ready
<PB N="417" REF="423">
lulled to &s;leep by fal&s;e policy and re|ligion, every thing &s;eems now neglected except the church: their mo&s;t devout &s;o|vereigns amu&s;e them with religious pro|ce&s;&s;ions, with building convents and churches; while the army, the garri&s;ons, the navy, are all neglected, and half the commi&s;&s;ions left vacant. If &s;uch mea&s;ures are continued, they cannot long be fit for war, and hence not very long a nation.</P>
<P>In every country &s;omething of import|ance may be learned. To follow the ideas of that great officer Count de la Lippe, and &s;ee what he did, and intended, for the defence of this country, would be one of the fine&s;t military le&s;&s;ons you could have. You &s;hould &s;ee Elvas, which he fortified, and examine all his excellent ideas of for|tification and artillery: his &s;afe flanks, para|pets, re&s;ources, carriages, modes of oecono|mi&s;ing power and &s;pace, of making powder, in &s;hort his excellent ideas on almo&s;t every military &s;ubject: and then his general plans of defending this frontier, and of at|tacking Spain.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER III.</HI> Policy. Indu&s;try. Character. Law.</HEAD>
<P>THIS little nation, under the manage|ment of their late mini&s;ter, the M. de Pombal, with all his faults and cruelties, had certainly begun to make &s;ome material advances and exertions, and to be again con&s;idered as of &s;ome importance in the &s;cale of Europe. Tho&s;e advances were chiefly owing to an intimate connection with England, and an enmity to Spain: both the&s;e powerful motives to national exertion, it is feared, are now fa&s;t wearing out, and no other can probably remain, &s;ufficient to &s;upport their activity, and prevent the fabric, &s;o little advanced, from falling to ruin. The pre&s;ent weak policy, of &s;ecretly courting the friend&s;hip of their natural enemy, will probably be productive of the wor&s;t con&s;equences to them. It is to be feared, from the Queen-mother's late
<PB N="419" REF="425">
journey to Madrid, that Portugal may now be con&s;idered as an appendage to Spain, and a member of the Bourbon alliance. Such are the con&s;equences of your mad American war; our allies will all for&s;ake, us, from an opinion of our inevitable de|cline, and of the ri&s;e of America. The&s;e con&s;iderations, be&s;ides her family motives, might determine this &s;en&s;ible old Queen to place this kingdom under the tutelage of Don Carlos. But though apparently a prudent mea&s;ure, it will be found, in time, to have been but a ha&s;ty and timid female policy, and would not have happened in the times of a Pombal or a Pitt. Though this kingdom may &s;oon become again a province to Spain, that monarchy, which is already too large to be well governed, is not likely to gain much additional force or advantage by the acqui&s;ition. And as the other nations will hardly agree to &s;uch a change without a war, in that war will con&s;i&s;t the only chance of &s;afety for Portu|gal, provided &s;he can be kept up to any tolerable degree of military preparation; but this we &s;hall now &s;ee Spain exerting
<PB N="420" REF="426">
all her &s;ecret influence to prevent. Indeed, if Spain could recover her ancient govern|ment, and then add and incorporate Portu|gal, the advantages might be very con|&s;iderable to both, and this penin&s;ula might ri&s;e to be a very great nation.</P>
<P>The &s;eeds of improvement have again been &s;own in this country with tho&s;e of luxury, though the produce now again be|comes doubtful. Their wants have been lately increa&s;ing, and tho&s;e mu&s;t increa&s;e the demand for the exertions of indu&s;try &s;omewhere: hence more improvements have been attempted here than in Spain; and being of a more governable &s;ize, their attempts have generally &s;ucceeded better. In the northern provinces of this penin|&s;ula, and in Catalonia, the people are the mo&s;t indu&s;trious, and their indu&s;try is &s;up|ported under many oppre&s;&s;ions, becau&s;e they are now accu&s;tomed to live well. The Portugue&s;e are more active and diligent &s;ince they began to love fine cloaths, and &s;ince their pride has changed its objects, from the black cloak and &s;pectacles, with
<PB N="421" REF="427">
an affectation of &s;anctity and wi&s;dom, and having nothing to do; though &s;ome &s;uch people are &s;till to be &s;een in certain parts of both the&s;e kingdoms. Certain kinds and degrees of luxury and expence become a &s;ource of activity among the people. It were to be wi&s;hed you could change the ta&s;te of &s;ome of your lower cla&s;&s;es, from drinking, to other more elegant and u&s;eful plea&s;ures. The puritani&s;m of your reform|ation, and your wretched Sunday police, are the &s;ources of low debauch; impedi|ments and misfortunes to an indu&s;trious nation. Might you not now venture to open your theatres on Sundays? and re|publi&s;h King James's book of &s;ports, with corrections and amendments?

<P>The people of this nation, as you may ob&s;erve in their hi&s;tory, are remarkable for &s;udden changes, without &s;ufficient fore|thought. Their two great revolutions were both quick and violent, and equally with|out

plan, or &s;y&s;tem of government; fir&s;t their recovery from the Moors, and then from Spain, who&s;e depredations they mu&s;t yet long feel. After admiring them as the di&s;coverers and conquerors of the Ea&s;t, we are pre&s;ently &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee them &s;o ea&s;ily beaten and &s;ubdued by the fir&s;t European power that follows them there. I have &s;omewhere learned an anecdote, that &s;oon after tho&s;e learned times of Emanuel, an enquiry was made for any one who could teach algebra to one of the princes, and that no &s;uch per&s;on could be found in the kingdom. Such men as Pombal and La Lippe, you &s;ee, could &s;uddenly turn them again into a re&s;pectable power, and almo&s;t an indu&s;trious people; and now we already begin to &s;ee them becoming very quickly as idle, corrupted, and &s;uper&s;titious as ever. On con&s;idering them individually, we find more than ordinary incon&s;i&s;tencies in their conduct and character; &s;uch as the mo&s;t penurious avarice, joined to a thought|le&s;s &s;loth, love of idlene&s;s and plea&s;ure: and very oppo&s;ite pa&s;&s;ions &s;eem to actuate them by turns, and in very quick &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion.

They are like overgrown children, always falling before temptation, and al|ways making fre&s;h and ineffectual re&s;olu|tions: and the Roman Catholic &s;uper&s;tition remarkably promotes this weakne&s;s, and purpo&s;ely debilitates the human character, in order to render it more manageable by the prie&s;thood.

<P>From the example of the&s;e two nations, we &s;hould be tempted to believe, that where there is mo&s;t law, there is lea&s;t ju&s;tice; as well as with the greate&s;t appearance of re|ligion, the lea&s;t moral conduct.

much more than they rectify: various writings are nece&s;&s;ary on every the &s;malle&s;t tran&s;action, and all are found in&s;ufficient: hardly any hou&s;e can be fini&s;hed, or any property po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, without tedious and re|peated law-&s;uits: the &s;ale of the &s;malle&s;t thing by auction mu&s;t be attended with writings; but &s;ecurity is thence dimini&s;h|ed; and one tedious proce&s;s, carried through all the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive appeals and tribunals, may only prove the &s;ource of many others in future: the lo&s;er revives his preten&s;ions on the fir&s;t change of &s;y&s;tem, or of friends at court.

<P>In the cour&s;e of civilization, of arts and refinement, the great and increa&s;ing body of lawyers probably merit more attention and regulation than has been u&s;ually be|&s;towed on them. Every &s;ociety of human

Hence the great difficulties of re|gulating the le&s;&s;er bodies, of which the great one, the nation, con&s;i&s;ts; and of forming a &s;y&s;tem of government, wherein the different parts may not combine again&s;t the re&s;t of the community. If any nation &s;hould ever, through all the &s;teps of im|provement, e&s;cape every other yoke, it may at la&s;t fall a prey to law it&s;elf; and the greate&s;t part of the property, and thence the government, might be gradually thrown into the hands of a powerful body of lawyers. They have many advantages in the&s;e countries, where there are &s;o few gentlemen &s;tudents of law, and where the people are &s;o univer&s;ally ignorant. I think they everywhere dictate the terms or words of mo&s;t laws, and by that means, probably, create much work for future members of

their corps, in future interpretations. I leave you to inve&s;tigate the con&s;equences. The termination of mo&s;t governments &s;eems to be that of ab&s;olute monarchy, as the la&s;t de&s;perate remedy; and of the different &s;pecies of tyranny, it is perhaps the mo&s;t tolerable, at lea&s;t in Europe.

<P>NO.&mdash;I do not forget my favourite text, and &s;hould perhaps have added in my la&s;t, if there had been room, that it is only by manners and education that nations, or their governments, can be re&s;tored: tho&s;e mu&s;t ri&s;e and fall together. Your great Bacons, Miltons, Lockes, &amp;c. have all &s;een and in&s;i&s;ted much on the importance of education; and we are &s;orry to &s;ee their opinion has had &s;o little effect. In &s;ome ancient nations, proper teachers, the philo|&s;ophers, and others, were probably men of more con&s;equence in &s;ociety than &s;uch men are with us. A good &s;chool in each of your pari&s;hes would remedy more evils, and ultimately improve the con&s;titution of your government more, than all your ef|forts

without them. I have been told, that Charles I. had &s;ome good plans on this &s;ub|ject, and might have done &s;ome good if he had been let alone. I think we are nearly agreed, that the general &s;uperiority of the lower ranks in the northern parts of our i&s;land is owing to their education; and that the ignorance of your country &s;quires becoming almo&s;t proverbial, mu&s;t have had &s;ome foundation: nay, I fear your pre&s;ent public danger and probable decline might be traced to the &s;ame &s;ource; the ab&s;urdity of &s;ome late mea&s;ures cannot well be un|der&s;tood, nor explained, without taking ignorance into the account. So many in|dependent country gentlemen, if they had had a tolerable education, with a little travel and knowledge of foreign affairs, could never &s;urely have been brought to agree to &s;uch mea&s;ures as that of taxing their own colonies in any other way but their own; or in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of Europe, to that of carrying a war acro&s;s the At|lantic, under &s;uch obvious di&s;advantages, and again&s;t the prejudices of all the world, to subdue what could never be worth the

conque&s;t; and then to the beginning at the wrong end, and in the wrong way; and without knowing the nature of the tools they had to work with, or of the materials they had to work upon, or even the true &s;tate of parties and affairs at home: How are we to account for &s;o much ignorance and illiberality in the fir&s;t and mo&s;t ge|nerous nation of Europe, or of the world?</P>
<P>On enquiring after &s;ome old friends and acquaintance here, military and others, men of merit and information; alas! we find they are almo&s;t all gone to the Inqui&s;i|tion: that horrid tribunal, it &s;eems, is again let loo&s;e in this reign again&s;t real merit and knowledge. The men mo&s;t likely to improve their brethren have ever been the mo&s;t obnoxious to this church. The Ro|man Catholic &s;y&s;tem, from the time of its being e&s;tabli&s;hed in its full inqui&s;itorial and mona&s;tic &s;everity, has &s;urely been more inimical to the advancement of human knowledge and improvement, than any other &s;uper&s;tition that ever was invented; it &s;eems better calculated to de&s;troy all the little remnants of happine&s;s that civil ty|ranny

might be forced or chu&s;e to &s;pare: and nothing could well have been contrived to render men more u&s;ele&s;s to &s;ociety, more detached, more indifferent, and often ini|mical, to each other. Profe&s;&s;ing to teach univer&s;al benevolence, it has in effect made them hate and per&s;ecute one another. But it has been in&s;tituted with &s;o much art, that it cannot be ea&s;ily changed or removed, and we know the difficulties of reforming it: till that is more effectually accompli&s;h|ed, its profe&s;&s;ors will contrive to throw the blame of all the mi&s;chief it occa&s;ions on their opponents. They have here &s;ucceed|ed wonderfully well in creating a &s;ure va|cancy for them&s;elves, by rendering the civil power incompetent to govern the minds of the people, &s;o as to render their own &s;up|plemental aid nece&s;&s;ary. The Romi&s;h con|clave has probably been the mo&s;t artful body of politicians known in hi&s;tory. They have, as they thought, u&s;ed precautions again&s;t every danger, and prepared a &s;alve for every &s;ore. They have had a hand in all the in&s;titutions of importance to &s;ociety: in education, marriage, inheritance, Al|mo&s;t
<PB N="431" REF="437">
mo&s;t every tribunal has been in&s;tituted, in|fluenced, or controlled, by the church. If every other guard and precaution &s;hould fail, they had the bugbears of &s;uper&s;tition always ready to frighten rea&s;on out of her way. But that church may now &s;oon &s;erve the world as an example, to &s;hew how in|&s;ufficient artifice alone is to govern man|kind, and that plain hone&s;ty and per&s;e|verance may hope to prevail again&s;t all im|po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Every church probably requires the whole&s;ome hand of control as much, at lea&s;t, as any other power in the &s;tate. To hit the proper medium is doubtle&s;s rather difficult; how to encourage u&s;eful learning, religion, and morality, &s;ince the&s;e have been joined, without giving to their teachers any dangerous power or influence: they mu&s;t have &s;ome, and will acquire more: How prevent their making any improper u&s;e of it? Permitting them to acquire, per|&s;onally, a cen&s;orial power and influence, and prevent their employing any of it po|litically, or as a body, are real difficulties:
<PB N="432" REF="438">
in the &s;urmounting of the&s;e, however, you have made con&s;iderable progre&s;s, and it is to be hoped you may &s;till go farther. A general and perfect toleration mu&s;t be the point towards which you &s;hould gradually move. I can never &s;ee any &s;ufficient rea|&s;ons, why your church government might not &s;afely admit of much greater latitude to the officiating clergy in forms and opinions; nor can I perceive why any &s;peculative opi|nions &s;hould di&s;qualify a man for any office that he is willing and able to fill. He &s;hould rather be encouraged to try: official practice and duties would gradually wear off the noxious edge of the mo&s;t inimical &s;peculations. It is high time to hazard a trial. Unle&s;s you enlarge the pale of church and &s;tate, how are all your outca&s;t &s;heep ever to come in? or how is a reconciliation to be expected? I &s;ee nothing to fear, but much to hope, from the hypocri&s;y of con|formity: but of that conformity, fir&s;t make the &s;teps few and ea&s;y, and not di&s;honour|able. You have got &s;o far as to preach up toleration, but you fail in the practice: your profe&s;&s;ed principles, and their nume|rous
<PB N="433" REF="439">
exceptions, de&s;troy each other. In the &s;ame breath with which you teach religious liberty, you abhor and anathemati&s;e the other &s;ects of chri&s;tians. Your church cannot judge in its own cau&s;e, and I am &s;orry to &s;ee the &s;tate judge &s;o little better. Even your wi&s;e and temperate divines, of whom you have many, when they come to particulars, and to the practice, are &s;carcely proof again&s;t the bugbear dangers of oppo&s;ite and &s;eemingly hurtful princi|ples; though the practice and hi&s;tory of the world, and even of their own religion, have &s;hewn us that the lion and the lamb may, by habit, be brought to live together. Our reformation has, doubtle&s;s, had the merit of re&s;toring to Chri&s;tianity much of her original mild and humane temper; and you are happily not now &s;o &s;en&s;ible as we are here, of the mi&s;chiefs of &s;uper-abundant zeal, and religious antipathies.</P>
<P>In mo&s;t &s;ubjects, but more e&s;pecially in the &s;peculative and uncertain, men mu&s;t differ in opinion, and a variety, rather than uniformity in religious &s;entiments, &s;eems
<PB N="434" REF="440">
to have been the intention of the Author of nature. Religion &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to mo&s;t men, and each is entitled to that of his own choice. The utility is obvious of &s;ome moral teachers, and perhaps they &s;hould be paid at lea&s;t in part by the &s;tate; but of this I am doubtful. It might be well if the pay and reward of every pro|fe&s;&s;ion could be made to depend chiefly on their own merits, and diligence towards tho&s;e they &s;erve. I am told that &s;ome of our governments in America might &s;erve the world as patterns in this, that they &s;uc|ceed much better for having no &s;tate re|ligion or e&s;tabli&s;hment, and that the people are found to be quite competent to the management of all that bu&s;ine&s;s for them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>You will perceive, that in giving you my doubts and opinions on the&s;e contro|verted &s;ubjects, I &s;peak politically, and as a layman. Some of our &s;cientific friends, who have likewi&s;e &s;een and &s;tudied the wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ld in different countries, may be able to reconcile tho&s;e and other politico-reli|gious
<PB N="435" REF="441">
difficulties, which, to me, appear to have become &s;o complicated with our go|vernments as to require the political and prudential wi&s;dom of ages yet to come, in order to arrange, &s;implify, and &s;ettle them as they ought to be. Nor can I pretend to decide on the proportion of good or harm that has been done by eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;hments in general, though I think it is evident enough here, that the balance is on the &s;ide of the latter; and that &s;uch in&s;titutions have been much more liable to abu&s;es than productive of benefits, in this, and &s;everal other countries. It is truly a&s;toni&s;hing, and will be &s;till more &s;o to an enlightened po&s;terity, how &s;uch nations as the&s;e, which are &s;carcely able to &s;upport them&s;elves, &s;hould maintain in affluence a &s;et of men, only to mi&s;lead, to tyrannize over, and devour them.</P>
<P>In this manner was I writing to you, when I received yours almo&s;t on the &s;ame &s;ubjects. Your account of tho&s;e &s;trange fanatical riots in your capital, did not &s;ur|prize me &s;o much as you may imagine. I
<PB N="436" REF="442">
&s;hould expect &s;uch things to happen oftener in &s;ome part or other of the country. I have frequently mentioned, that the &s;pirit of fanatici&s;m &s;till exi&s;ts among the people almo&s;t every where, and that it is not &s;uf|ficiently known or under&s;tood by the &s;u|perior ranks of men. We ought to be thank|ful that religious wars have cea&s;ed &s;o long, and that a little time is given to rea&s;on to re|cover her&s;elf. If rea&s;on could acquire zeal and energy enough to make the mo&s;t of the occa&s;ion, &s;omething might perhaps be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed to keep fanatici&s;m quiet till &s;he lo&s;e or change her name and temper. I agree with you, that a perfect toleration would be the be&s;t remedy; but where is it to be found? unle&s;s it be in North America. Till the civil and religious con&s;titution of your governments can be formed on prin|ciples of mental freedom, there cannot be much &s;ecurity of peace. While we depend on the accidental balance of &s;ects and parties, which is &s;o &s;ubject to gradual changes, religious war is not bani&s;hed; &s;he only remains quiet till employed by &s;ome powerful hypocrite or enthu&s;ia&s;t. And if
<PB N="437" REF="443">
you wait till then, Prote&s;tanti&s;m may prove the weake&s;t &s;ide. Reformers, after their fir&s;t fervours, mu&s;t probably continue to grow more lukewarm, and divided among them|&s;elves; the philo&s;ophic apathy of their li|beral and learned members is but ill-&s;uited to cope with the zeal and a&s;&s;iduity, the unity and enmity, of their opponents. I fear we cannot &s;oon hope for a complete toleration, nor expect the church volun|tarily to grant places and power to their enemies, which they probably are, while treated as &s;uch.</P>
<P>However, toleration being the only re|medy, and hence the object to be kept in view, let us not lo&s;e &s;ight of it: and it mu&s;t be pur&s;ued with that philo&s;ophic tem|per which is fit for legi&s;lation, though not for fighting. We mu&s;t often accept of partial benefits, and &s;hould not refu&s;e a part becau&s;e we cannot have the whole, nor reject laws for being only partially liberal and wi&s;e. Though we cannot arrive at perfection, let us not neglect the &s;teps of approximation within our power. Such is
<PB N="438" REF="444">
the condition of human affairs: we mu&s;t work with the tools, and with mankind, as we find them, and build our &s;y&s;tems on the habits and principles already e&s;tabli&s;hed, with a view only to gradual improvement. We mu&s;t not quarrel with the human race, and give them up in de&s;pair, becau&s;e we &s;ee them &s;o often employed in e&s;tabli&s;hing fal&s;e principles, and then labouring to avert and correct their con&s;equences, by which the utmo&s;t exertion of human wi&s;dom is wa&s;ted in patching and mending its own errors. We &s;ee many abu&s;es in &s;ociety that mu&s;t be left to grow big enough for a remedy, and become of a certain magnitude to de|&s;erve a law which, like all other remedies in nature, is it&s;elf an evil; and we mu&s;t wait till the remedy becomes the le&s;&s;er evil before it is applied. By watching and managing occa&s;ions, move conce&s;&s;ions may be gradually obtained in favour of the na|tural freedom of opinion; taking care neither to awaken tho&s;e inclined to &s;leep within the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, nor alarm the watchful bigots without.</P>
<P><PB N="439" REF="445">Toleration, though not yet completely attainable where there is a &s;tate religion, would however be found &s;o advantageous to all, that it might probably keep its ground if once admitted. It is perhaps for its ex|cellence that this remedy is &s;o hated and dreaded by the Romi&s;h church. But neither toleration, nor prote&s;tanti&s;m, can be &s;afe while any of the mona&s;tic or inqui&s;itorial &s;pirit remains in Europe. In that &s;pirit you may &s;till &s;ee your mo&s;t powerful ene|my. Monachi&s;m and prote&s;tanti&s;m, like fire and water, cannot long exi&s;t together in this great European republic, and &s;till le&s;s in the &s;ame nation. In that natural war, which mu&s;t ever &s;ecretly &s;ub&s;i&s;t be|tween them, the former mu&s;t probably conquer at la&s;t, if not gradually extirpated in due time, and while it can be done with temper and moderation. It &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all the advantages of a regular &s;tanding army, over an irregular and unconnected militia.</P>
<P>It is the variety of opinions, &s;o wi&s;ely ordered by nature, that now &s;aves men
<PB N="440" REF="446">
from the per&s;ecutions of each other. The mo&s;t &s;ingular opinions have been indi|vidually propagated without inconvenience to the public. Common ties and duties guide men while in &s;ociety; it is only when they leave it, and become members of other communities, that their opinions can have any influence that concerns the &s;tate. The &s;pirit and effects of all po&s;&s;ible corporate bodies of men, &s;eparated from the re&s;t of the nation, have not yet, I think, been &s;ufficiently &s;tudied. The object, de|grees, and terms of &s;uch &s;eparation, are known to be of importance, but they have not yet been well mea&s;ured and e&s;timated. Separate bodies, or a&s;&s;ociations, can only be admi&s;&s;ible on condition of their injur|ing neither the public, nor any individual. The Romi&s;h church, and her incorporate bodies of mona&s;tic orders, have far tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ed tho&s;e e&s;&s;ential conditions. And tho&s;e armies of veterans, &s;o wonderfully formed and united on the mo&s;t unnatural objects and principles, with the Pope at their head, have proved the mo&s;t formid|able enemy that ever was rai&s;ed again&s;t
<PB N="441" REF="447">
rea&s;on, liberty, and nature; by them the Popi&s;h &s;y&s;tem has been well &s;upported, and may po&s;&s;ibly yet be re&s;tored. If that &s;y&s;tem could have been completely e&s;tabli&s;hed on its profe&s;&s;ed principles, con&s;idering only a future &s;tate, and not this life, as worthy of our care and attention, it mu&s;t have been immoveable, or have put an end to &s;ociety, or the human race, of which there was indeed once &s;ome appearance of danger, during the fir&s;t fervours of that &s;eclu&s;ive mona&s;tic mania. Though mona&s;teries be|came afterwards of &s;ome u&s;e, and &s;erved at times as a&s;ylums again&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion, or as repo&s;itories of declining knowledge and in|du&s;try; but when their utility cea&s;ed, they became a burden to &s;ociety, or wor&s;e, and ought long ago to have been aboli&s;hed, if the rapacity of princes and governments could be tru&s;ted with the di&s;po&s;al of their property for the public good. Fortunately their ab&s;urd principles, though &s;o artfully propagated as to &s;ucceed beyond belief, had however to labour &s;o much again&s;t human nature, that &s;he at length proved too &s;trong for them: but in the conte&s;t, &s;he has not
<PB N="442" REF="448">
come off without injury, lo&s;s of time, and force. The human character, &s;o long in the &s;hackles of &s;uper&s;tition, may never again be able to walk well without them, nor recover her natural power and energy. The &s;ecular Romi&s;h clergy, with &s;imilar principles, neverthele&s;s maintain a cha|racter and conduct far le&s;s bigotted and pernicious, which is probably owing to their remaining officially more mixed with men, living and acting with us in the duties and occcupations of life which, in that &s;itu|tion, become more powerful than the un|natural principles and &s;peculations of their profe&s;&s;ion. If the Pope can ever be com|pelled to relieve them from celibacy, di&s;|pen&s;e with the mona&s;tic vows, and aboli&s;h the regular orders, the dangers to liberty and improvement will be over, but not till then. Good policy may now join with philo&s;ophy to encourage you to &s;ingle out, and declare war again&s;t mo&s;t of the mona&s;tic orders; and you may &s;oon get others (even Catholic) &s;tates to join &s;ecretly in &s;uch mea|&s;ures. This is no longer one of tho&s;e po|pular torrents that would overflow and in|crea&s;e
<PB N="443" REF="449">
by oppo&s;ing it in front. Only the Pope, and a few adherents of &s;mall weight and importance, continue to &s;upport the monks: nay, they are rather generally de|te&s;ted by a large majority of mo&s;t ranks, except &s;ome of the lowe&s;t, and regarded with a jealous di&s;like even by the &s;ecular clergy of their own church. All the&s;e would &s;ecretly rejoice at their di&s;&s;olution, and at every thing that might tend to di&s;|appoint their views and credit, which de|pend much on their foreign mi&s;&s;ions: there, they are &s;ingularly laborious and in|defatigable, and are not to be diverted from their purpo&s;e by any &s;ocial or human feel|ings; the&s;e are all &s;uper&s;eded and lo&s;t in the habits and di&s;cipline of their order: not like <HI>Turgol,</HI> who &s;aid lately to his king, that he was a man before he was an <HI>in|tendant:</HI> but the&s;e men &s;eem to have been born friars, and to have taken the &s;pirit of their order from their mother's womb.

the progre&s;s of reformation, of knowledge, and indu&s;try. It might be good policy for government to furni&s;h the people there with prie&s;ts educated at home, to prevent their being &s;upplied with tho&s;e regular bigots from abroad. From every &s;tate of freedom &s;hould &s;uch in&s;titutions, with all their members, be excluded. All the &s;ects, indeed, who&s;e principles admit not of mu|tual toleration, &s;hould be forced to it as a fir&s;t condition of their being tolerated them|&s;elves. A ju&s;t government would not only refrain from dictating any &s;peculative opi|nions to its &s;ubjects, but would prevent its being done by others. Men &s;hould be pro|tected from the tyranny of their own &s;ect, and all the &s;ects from each other. Under this head might be comprehended all that the &s;tate has to do with religion. The great object of the mona&s;tic orders is now the recovery of the lo&s;t &s;heep, and convert|ing the nations who have &s;trayed from the flock. In &s;ome of the&s;e, unle&s;s wi&s;er precau|tions are u&s;ed, it may require only a few &s;teps farther towards a certain degree of corrup|tion and decline, and hence a licentious de|pravity

in the lower ranks, &s;o as to bring on a di&s;po&s;ition towards de&s;poti&s;m, the general but ineffectual remedy of vice and ignorance.

Dogmatical deci&s;ions upon &s;peculative and controverted points are very con&s;i&s;tent with the genius of the church of Rome, but can never be vindicated in a Prote&s;tant church upon the grand principles of the Reformation, namely, that the &s;criptures of the Old and New Te&s;tament are the only rule of faith and manners, and that in them every Chri&s;tian is bound to &s;earch for tho&s;e truths which are nece&s;&s;ary to his &s;alvation.</P>

If holy &s;cripture, as our church maintains, in her &s;ixth article, containeth all things nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation, can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that hu|man articles and creeds are nece&s;&s;ary to enable the Go&s;pel to maintain its ground in the world? No. The church of Chri&s;t, we have our Saviour's word for it, is founded upon a rock, which all the powers of darkne&s;s &s;hall never be able to overthrow, and his religion will always find its way into the hearts of the well-di&s;po&s;ed, without re|quiring any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the arbitrary decrees of &s;ynods, con&s;i&s;tories, and convocations. The articles and creeds of the church of England were de&s;igned to prevent diver&s;ity of opinion in matters of religion, an attempt both ab&s;urd and impracticable, as experience hath fully evinced; for is it not well known that Calvini&s;ts and Arminians, Tri|nitarians and Arians, officiate in the e&s;tabli&s;hed church? and while men of &s;uch di&s;cordant principles continue to enter promi&s;cuou&s;ly into the church, can any rea&s;onable plea be adduced either for the expediency or utility of continuing the pre&s;ent mode of &s;ub&s;cription? For, to u&s;e the words of the great Era&s;mus, as bonds, deeds, cove|nants, obligations, indentures, expre&s;&s;ed in a multitude of words, afford matter for law-&s;uits; &s;o, in religion, a profu&s;ion of determinations, decrees, and deci&s;ions, begets endle&s;s controver&s;ies. Any que&s;tion concerning Chri&s;t's knowing or fore&s;eeing the bad u&s;es that might be made of his religion, I think ought by no means

<P>IN the&s;e northern provinces of Portugal are found the mo&s;t indu&s;trious people, as well as the plea&s;ante&s;t country. The export of their linens to the Brazils is yearly increa&s;ing, without any particular encouragement, or any great manufactory being e&s;tabli&s;hed. The junction of do|me&s;tic arts and trades in villages, manu|facture with agriculture, is highly advanta|geous to a country, and has generally &s;uc|ceeded whenever it has been attempted, as in England, Sile&s;ia, Switzerland. The country is nobly varied into mountains, hills, vales, and woods, all on the&s;e beau|tiful rivers, the Minho, Lima, and Douro, and others that feed them. The vine|yards, trees, and white hou&s;es, mix well with the rocks and rivers: but I decline

de&s;criptions. The&s;e rivers are embarra&s;&s;ed with increa&s;ing bars at their mouths, which might have been removed by art and in|du&s;try, and which an increa&s;ing commerce would &s;oon have repaid with intere&s;t. There is no public concern that requires a more con&s;tant national attention than &s;ea|ports. In the&s;e, and in good roads, con&s;i&s;ts the chief foundation of the &s;uperiority of civilized and cultivated nations, over the barbarous and ignorant, or oppre&s;&s;ed. The larger plains of Braga and Guimaraens are richly planted, watered, and cultivated. In de&s;cending from the &s;urrounding moun|tains, the rich fields, the vineyards, and luxuriant produce, furni&s;h the mo&s;t grate|ful &s;cenes and pro&s;pects. The fine&s;t fruit-trees fe&s;tooned with vines, as in Italy. But we are di&s;appointed to find, amid&s;t &s;uch apparent plenty, the mi&s;erable &s;tate of animal life, and &s;o di&s;proportioned to the vegetable: men, children, cattle, in &s;o &s;tarving a condition. I believe this is too often the ca&s;e throughout the world; in the fine&s;t countries the mo&s;t mi&s;erable peo|ple. The cau&s;es of it may be various.
<PB N="454" REF="460">
Nece&s;&s;ity is the mother of all exertion; no|thing le&s;s can move us. Nature, by fur|ni&s;hing the wants of men too ea&s;ily, cur|tails their powers. Canes, reeds, gourds, the palm and the cocoa tree, help to pro|duce and perpetuate indolence and &s;tupi|dity. The cold climate, and the rocky mountains, often force indu&s;try. But in mo&s;t old nations, where oppre&s;&s;ion has generally been progre&s;&s;ive, the &s;tate, the church, and the landlord, at length take all the produce and profit from tho&s;e who la|bour, except the barely nece&s;&s;ary: that, being in England two or three times more than it is here, mu&s;t be left to the cultiva|tor: &s;o that &s;ome degree of luxury, ex|pence, and good living among the people, becomes a public good. I think the cattle of poor people are almo&s;t every where alike, and nearly of the &s;ame poor ragged kind: a variety of improved breeds of cattle can only be found in a country of rich farmers.</P>

Their <HI>Bon Je&s;us,</HI> or Mount Calvary, is a great work, con&s;i&s;ting of roads, &s;tairs, chapels, up through a plea&s;ant a&s;cent of a woody mountain. It mu&s;t have been at|tended with great labour and expence. Where de&s;poti&s;m has left no other power but the church that is capable of great works, the public is obliged to her when &s;he chu&s;es to employ a numerous poor, though in u&s;ele&s;s labour: and &s;till more, when &s;he employs them in works of ta&s;te.</P>
<P><HI>Oporto</HI> has been much improved and beautified by its pre&s;ent governor Don Juan d'Almada, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and ad|vice of our good con&s;ul.

They had the plan from our judicious Car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> but the paper is now nearly rotten, and in pieces, and none of them can copy any part of it, nor can they go on without it, and hardly indeed with it. Unle&s;s &s;cience, ta&s;te, and &s;ecurity, accompany the intro|duction of riches, they cannot have half their natural effects, nor appear in public or private works and improvements: but here the appearance of the adjacent coun|try forms almo&s;t an exception to this rule. The ta&s;te of the Engli&s;h merchants for country hou&s;es and gardens has con&s;ider|ably prevailed, in &s;pite of bad tenures, workmen, &amp;c. And the green woods, &s;peckled with white hou&s;es, accord with the rocky &s;cenery in furni&s;hing out many beautiful land&s;capes. But other works loudly demanded more of their public at|tention. Half their liberalities to churches, convents, and ho&s;pitals, would have re|moved the bar of their river and improved its navigation, and might, by this time, have doubled their commerce and indu&s;try.</P>
<P><PB N="457" REF="463">The trade and pro&s;perity of the Brazils might be carried almo&s;t to any imaginable extent by a free and wi&s;e government.

By my be&s;t accounts, that coun|try is capable of every kind of produce and improvement, to a degree beyond what has been generally conceived. The late mi|ni&s;ter did not overlook &s;o great an object: there, he attempted a great deal, as u&s;ual, &s;ome of which &s;ucceeded: he tried to re|gulate and legi&s;late for that great colony, and to liberate the people from the oppre&s;|&s;ion of viceroys, &amp;c. but the di&s;tance, the corruption, and decline, are too great for &s;uch trivial modes of reformation. Probably nothing le&s;s than a free government, &s;uch as that of &s;ome of our colonies, and a total &s;eparation from Portugal, could give to the Brazils the pro&s;perity of which it is ca|pable: and if we could at the &s;ame time bring this, the mother-country, up to a government &s;omething like ours; &s;uch &s;eem to be the only ways left to pre&s;erve

<P>Their wine trade here has long been in a pro&s;perous increa&s;ing way, from the time of our Queen Anne, or perhaps earlier, when other wines of this coa&s;t, as tho&s;e of Viana and Galicia, were in fa&s;hion; the&s;e might be improved, and again come to be liked; our ta&s;te is changeable. About thirty thou&s;and pipes, they &s;ay, are exported here annually to England, at about 15 <HI>l.</HI> a pipe&mdash;half a million: it co&s;ts you, that drink it, at lea&s;t a million, and you pro|bably pay as much more for other wines and &s;pirits; &s;o that we Engli&s;h &s;wallow above two millions in foreign drink. A great joint &s;tock and privileged company is e&s;tabli&s;hed here, originally by Pombal; &s;o little did he know of commerce. They might &s;oon, if favoured by an ignorant government, engro&s;s all the wine trade of the country: which indeed they might have done ere now, if the zeal and activity of indi|viduals did not enable them to &s;upport &s;ome competition even with great companies.
<PB N="459" REF="465">
If this company undertake the woollen fabrics, as talked of, they may &s;oon be ruined. They may become creditors to a government which can give them no &s;ecu|rity: though it may pay them with &s;ome grant or privilege to cheat or oppre&s;s the people, it will afterwards &s;queeze them as a &s;punge. They had better go on, con|tending with the Engli&s;h merchants, a competition which is of &s;ervice to all par|ties. Though a &s;pirit of monopoly is per|haps inherent in trade, and particularly in companies, a wi&s;e government will be watchful to counteract it, and pre&s;erve a fair competition. A great company would probably &s;oon ruin any country, if it could be as active and a&s;&s;iduous as an individual: but happily their powers are generally di&s;|proportioned to their di&s;po&s;ition; and great combinations or confederacies are luckily &s;ubject to more failures and defects than &s;ingle per&s;ons, which help to dimini&s;h the dread and danger to the re&s;t of mankind.</P>
<P>Whatever concerns the lower and mo&s;t numerous cla&s;&s;es of men &s;hould be the mo&s;t

The general police of a country, its merits and defects, are objects of importance to travellers: but I do not mean to trouble you with particulars which cannot intere&s;t you much at that di&s;tance. Our poor fi&s;hermen here are taxed above 70 <HI>per cent.</HI> of what they pro|duce or catch, and yet they are numerous, though very poor and ragged, or rather naked. The poverty of the people, and hence their indifference about the comforts of life, are evils of exten&s;ive influence on the improvements of a nation. Where the lower cla&s;&s;es are &s;o ea&s;ily &s;upplied and &s;atisfied, nobody cares much about their comforts or conveniencies. Hence the ho&s;pitals, pri&s;ons, barracks, inns, &amp;c. are &s;o badly &s;upplied, and cruelly neglected: and though the people who inhabit tho&s;e places &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed as ea&s;y and con|tented as tho&s;e of other countries in &s;imilar &s;ituations, it can only be becau&s;e they are habituated to poverty, dirt, and ill treat|ment, which renders them &s;o much the meaner, weaker, and more u&s;ele&s;s beings.

<P>LISBON.&mdash;Here, even more than in other great towns, the benevolent mind is wounded on viewing the mixture of luxury and mi&s;ery, the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing ex|tremes of poverty and affluence, in a thou|&s;and ways. The melancholy hi&s;tory of its de&s;truction by the earthquake in 1755 is well known. It is &s;till rebuilding on a plan of the Marquis de Pombal's, which, though noble and magnificent, is rather gigantic, and barbarou&s;ly great too, <HI>a l'E&s;pagnole.</HI> This town was always re|markable, I believe, for being at once &s;umptuous and na&s;ty, and will probably be &s;o &s;till. The &s;mell of the tide, at low wa|ter, is very di&s;agreeable in all the lower parts, as well as that of every hou&s;e you enter. Common &s;ewers, cleanline&s;s, in|ternal
<PB N="463" REF="469">
conveniencies, have all been too much &s;acrificed to external appearance, which, after all, is in a bad &s;tyle of archi|tecture; immen&s;e ranges of building with|out parts, ill proportioned and divided: it is obvious, that nothing but the out&s;ide drawings of the elevations have been pre|viou&s;ly con&s;idered, and that the art and arti&s;t have been controlled by the igno|rance of power. We may form opinions of a nation from their ta&s;te in the arts, and &s;tyle of their public buildings. Sacrificing too much to appearances, to graces and ornaments, may be the vice of the age. Wi&s;dom &s;aid, let the u&s;eful be ornamented; but Folly rever&s;ed the order of the &s;entence, and &s;ub&s;tituted the acce&s;&s;ory for the prin|cipal. Where you &s;ee trivial things crowd|ed with ornaments, and without &s;ufficient &s;paces of relief or repo&s;e for the eye, from the extremes of confu&s;ion, or of unifor|mity; from the lofty domes or ranges of columns, where nothing of importance is either to be covered or &s;upported, you may deduce the imbecility of the arti&s;t, and partly of the nation where he could be

employed in preference. The mini&s;ter had certainly great merit in getting the city re|built at all; and there is a grandeur and &s;ublimity, though a want of ta&s;te and &s;ci|ence, in his idea: but we &s;hould have ex|pected a real great man to have encouraged the arti&s;ts, foreign and native, by promot|ing a competition for the be&s;t plan, in&s;tead of enforcing his own. We find him, like many other great men, not exempt from the weakne&s;s of fancying he knew every thing better than any body el&s;e; he had the misfortune of being beyond control. No man cho&s;e to pre&s;ume to under&s;tand even his own trade equally with him. This noble &s;ituation certainly de&s;erved the be&s;t plan po&s;&s;ible. Nature &s;eems to have mark|ed out this &s;ite, and this city, for the capi|tal of the penin&s;ula; and if the Philips had moved their court thither, their po&s;terity might now have been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole.</P>
<P>The Marquis de Pombal was certainly a great and bold reformer, and at two or three critical periods was of &s;ignal &s;ervice

to his country. His intrepid and active &s;pirit rai&s;ed his nation from indolent and &s;upine in&s;ignificance, to a degree of exer|tion, and to a &s;tation in the general &s;cale, long unknown to them, and to which it might ea&s;ily have been kept up, if mana|ged only with common attention and abili|ties, by pur&s;uing the maxims of which he had already &s;urmounted the difficulties of e&s;tabli&s;hing. But they already &s;ink in the &s;cale, and mu&s;t probably decline &s;till far|ther. I wi&s;h you to look yet higher for a real great man&mdash;for a legi&s;lator. The genius and the knowledge of this mini&s;ter did not go far enough beyond mediocrity in the great leading principles and objects of the fir&s;t importance to a nation; nor could he e&s;tabli&s;h a free and permanent con&s;titution in the &s;tate, which is the only effort of wi&s;dom and virtue that can entitle a man to the character of a lawgiver, or that can &s;ecure an eternal name and a la&s;ting nation. You &s;ee how few of the numerous regulations of our modern re|formers can outlive them. However, this mini&s;ter, by an union, rather uncommon,
<PB N="466" REF="472">
of boldne&s;s and artifice, by a knowledge of men, and of England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He confe&s;&s;es freely, that he learned what he knows of politics, in England, and chiefly from Sir Robert W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l.</NOTE>, he effected &s;ome great and many difficult things. He un|dertook and completed certain kinds of enterpri&s;e and reformation which were then thought impo&s;&s;ible, as on occa&s;ion of the war with Spain, of the earthquake, the con&s;piracy, in commerce, colonies, colleges, church, nobility, &amp;c. the hi&s;tory of all which is tolerably known. Though we may doubt his under&s;tanding all the minutiae of every bu&s;ine&s;s into which he cho&s;e to enter, and had the ambition to lead, it is plain that he knew men, and particularly his countrymen, whom he could either <HI>lead</HI> or <HI>drive;</HI> and we are therefore &s;urpri&s;ed to find him often pre|ferring the latter mode, and cannot believe that &s;o many examples of inhuman cruelty were nece&s;&s;ary for any good political pur|po&s;e; nor can we conceive that the na|tional character required &s;uch &s;everity.

times, be cruel and vindictive, when hur|ried away by their keen and temporary pa&s;&s;ions; yet they &s;oon cool and repent. The too frequent in&s;tances of private re|venge may be more owing to the &s;tate of laws and &s;ociety, than to any thing in their native character or temper of mind, which, though hot and violent, is, I think, naturally generous, affable, forgiving. They might be ruled by the &s;ceptre of equity ea&s;ier and better than by the rod of iron.</P>
<P>We may likewi&s;e regret in this mini&s;ter, that &s;ome of his public &s;chemes had too often a retro&s;pect to his own little private or family intere&s;ts. For example, we un|der&s;tand, that he adopted the ab&s;urd French idea of forcing the people to root up their vines to &s;ow the land with corn. The law being found too &s;evere, exceptions and indulgences were granted: and on the whole, his own e&s;tates were made to profit the mo&s;t by tho&s;e changes.

of the di&s;intere&s;ted efforts of virtue; but a real great mind, in the pur&s;uit of important objects, mu&s;t be above pecuniary intere&s;ts. More benevolence and magnanimity, with deeper &s;cience and greater views, joined to his boldne&s;s and deci&s;ion, would have made him a great legi&s;lator, and a reformer of exten&s;ive and la&s;ting utility. He probably thought him&s;elf eminent as a legi&s;lator, as an architect, a general, a merchant, &amp;c.; but his greatne&s;s in all the&s;e capacities be|gins already to appear at lea&s;t doubtful, though he mu&s;t ever be allowed &s;ignal merit as a &s;ecretary of &s;tate. Like mo&s;t modern reformers, he was not probably aware, that in order to produce the total change which he wanted, and e&s;tabli&s;h his reform on a fixed and la&s;ting ba&s;is, the exi&s;ting principles and form of the whole political machine required a total though gradual renovation, which could not be effected by putting his hand to particular parts, where the motion mu&s;t cea&s;e when the hand is withdrawn. He doubtle&s;s correct|ed may abu&s;es, and many of his laws were good, if they could have la&s;ted. Since his

regulations for the admi&s;&s;ion of monks, and his limiting their number, the com|mons and wa&s;te lands have been ob&s;erved to dimini&s;h. The &s;ons of the country peo|ple, deprived of that re&s;ource of idlene&s;s and &s;uper&s;tition, have been obliged to at|tempt farming and other indu&s;trious ways of life; but that happy progre&s;s is already at a &s;tand; the gates of holy church are again open for reception. We hear, that during the fir&s;t year after the late king's death, and the retreat of his mini&s;ter, the bi&s;hop of Braga alone has admitted 7000 into holy orders. The benefits re|&s;ulting from his de&s;truction of the order of Je&s;uits I con&s;ider as doubtful. It was de|&s;troying their be&s;t &s;chools before they had any others to &s;upply their place; nor are they likely &s;oon to find any: and it is po&s;|&s;ible, that Catholic Europe may thence de|cline in&s;tead of advancing in knowledge and &s;cientific improvements. If monachi&s;m were admi&s;&s;ible in any &s;ociety, that order might perhaps have been reformed to ad|vantage, and rendered more u&s;eful, with|out a total abolition. Be&s;ides, they were,
<PB N="470" REF="476">
like your oppo&s;ition, always &s;ome check upon regal power, though not always from the virtuous motives of public good. But for that rea&s;on has the jealou&s;y of mo|narchs been awakened, and contributed the mo&s;t to their downfal. Their greate&s;t merit was probably that of promoting and improving education, which they might have been made to improve &s;till farther.

<P>The Marquis's &s;chool of commerce here was certainly a good idea, and highly proper in a country from whence the true principles of trade had &s;o long been bani&s;h|ed; but he might have &s;ucceeded better had he attempted le&s;s, which may fre|quently be ob&s;erved of reformers, when they de&s;cend to minutiae. A great man e&s;tabli&s;hes general laws and principles, and leaves to their gradual influence, and to time, the bringing up of many le&s;&s;er ob|jects. His plan of reformation in the univer&s;ity of Coimbra was likewi&s;e good,

but the particulars again too voluminous; the &s;pirit and the merits of his &s;y&s;tem, all enveloped and regulated away in huge volumes of mona&s;tic minutiae. However, &s;everal good foreign profe&s;&s;ors had been collected; but &s;ome of the natives having caught a little too much of contagious &s;cience and freedom, were &s;oon &s;ent to the Inqui&s;ition, and the foreigners have de|parted. Mo&s;t of his other in&s;titutions, manufactories, &amp;c. have &s;hared the &s;ame fate, or will &s;oon follow. His regulations re&s;pecting the church and the nobility &s;eem too often dictated by a kind of cruel hatred to them, more than by a regard to the public weal. He might, with a better grace, have reduced their power and in&s;o|lence, if not &s;o obviou&s;ly tending to in|crea&s;e his own. Among his various re|forms, it is rather &s;urpri&s;ing he did not aboli&s;h the Inqui&s;ition; but he has cho&s;en to retain it for the malignant purpo&s;e of employing it as a &s;tate, or rather a mi|ni&s;terial, engine.</P>
<P><PB N="472" REF="478">Anxious and ardent minds, intent on their object, are apt to overlook many things that lie in the path which leads to it; and they forget that the path is life it|&s;elf, and may be too &s;hort to reach the point in view.

Several e&s;&s;ential parts in the &s;y&s;tem of national pro&s;perity he overlooked or mi&s;under&s;tood, as well as the firm and con&s;titutional mode of fixing them on intere&s;ts of &s;ufficient &s;upport: &s;uch as roads, po&s;ts, finance, agriculture, and above all, a legi&s;lature; in the&s;e, his ideas &s;eem to have been nei|ther &s;ufficiently enlarged nor modernized. Commerce remains &s;till overwhelmed with ill-judged duties and regulations: internal taxation not better. For example, the additional tenth laid during their la&s;t war, and &s;till continued, is probably more pre|judicial than another of &s;ix times the amount, if more equally di&s;tributed. This, being levied only on lands and hou&s;es that

I leave you to en|quire into the farther particulars of their taxation and finance when nece&s;&s;ary. The my&s;tery with which the operations and amount of their revenue are here concealed, may be con&s;idered among the &s;ymptoms and fooli&s;h arcana of de&s;poti&s;m. The amount, I under&s;tand, is &s;ubject to con|&s;iderable fluctuation and uncertainty, as well as many other things in this country. There can be no &s;ecurity, nor &s;tability, where the &s;upreme power is &s;o &s;ubject to change its principles with every change of circum&s;tances, of per&s;ons or events. The longe&s;t life of one man, though the be&s;t of kings or mini&s;ters, will never prove a &s;uf|ficient dependence for the people, to give them time or courage to improve in mat|ters of any great national importance. In &s;hort, the &s;tate reformer, who does not e&s;tabli&s;h a balanced and a la&s;ting con&s;titu|tion, does nothing.

Schemers of every cla&s;s form an u&s;eful race of men, and are not yet con&s;idered as they de&s;erve. The bold political innovator is probably as nece&s;&s;ary a character as any other, for the improvement of the world. He leads us beyond the bounds of habit and cu&s;tom, a nece&s;&s;ary &s;tep to future advances; and though he may &s;ometimes lead us wrong, it is perhaps better to go wrong &s;ometimes than &s;tand &s;till too long.

<P>In &s;ome things, the&s;e people have kept &s;till farther behind the re&s;t of Europe than Spain. Many of their moral ideas, their notions of honour, revenge, fidelity, of love and marriage, you will find very dif|ferent from ours. It appears in hi&s;tory, that they were not formerly &s;o very differ|ent from the re&s;t of Europe, and that they had, in the days of chivalry, &s;ome as gallant knights as any of the other nations, and many eminent officers at the time of their conque&s;ts and di&s;coveries: and we are at a lo&s;s to account for the ba&s;e modes of private revenge here, taking place of the more ge|nerous method of duelling, which, though &s;till barbarous, has long been general, and perhaps not quite unnece&s;&s;ary nor u&s;ele&s;s in Europe. Some of the cau&s;es of the&s;e and other differences might be traced to

the power of their church and the badne&s;s of their government; the one being yet more powerful, ignorant, and &s;uper&s;titious, and the other more de&s;potic and defective, than even tho&s;e of Spain.

<P>Such are the books, after all, probably of the mo&s;t utility to man; tho&s;e of arts

In con&s;idering the immen|&s;ity of other publications, I am often led to doubt whether their utility may not di|mini&s;h with their number, till at la&s;t the &s;peculative and learned will write only for each other; while tho&s;e who have other bu&s;ine&s;s to mind will de&s;pair, at the &s;ight of our immen&s;e increa&s;ing libraries, of any information that way, and the bulk of mankind remain &s;till more ignorant and in|different of what pa&s;&s;es among the learned. The voluminous comments of the la&s;t ages, and the trifling chit-chat &s;tyle of this, may &s;o fill the world with volumes as to frighten our idle &s;ons from reading any of them. But let us hope that time will purge away the dro&s;s and leave only the u&s;eful, and that our numerous works may be of more &s;ervice to po&s;terity than to us, when the e&s;&s;ence comes to be extracted and brought together. Hence good epitomes of pa&s;t knowledge become the mo&s;t u&s;eful publica|tions, as it is only by &s;uch means that &s;cience can be diffu&s;ed, and have beneficial influence on a whole nation.</P>
<P><PB N="483" REF="489">I approve much of your reading Monte&s;|quieu, A. Fergu&s;on, A. Smith, Hume, and Black&s;tone. As I would have you think as well as read, I &s;hould prefer the book that is the oftene&s;t turned down on the table, to take a turn round the room, and that makes you dwell and fea&s;t upon thinking. Take enlarged views of man, of the whole &s;pecies, as well as of nations, cla&s;&s;es, and individuals; contemplate human nature and &s;ociety in the declining, and in the advancing &s;tate. When we con&s;ider the active principles in our nature, it is difficult to conceive how the human race can well become retrograde. Surely nothing le&s;s than the united efforts of tyranny and &s;u|per&s;tition, of pa&s;&s;ion and ignorance, could deprive them of their natural habits of pur|&s;uing their own intere&s;t, and hence, when well under&s;tood, that of the &s;ociety and of the &s;pecies. However, this is not rare, but frequent in the hi&s;tory of mankind: their natural indu&s;try is often &s;o checked and &s;tifled that the national &s;tock dimi|ni&s;hes, and the &s;ociety declines: we &s;ee it in the&s;e two nations every &s;tep we take.

Portugal, I am &s;ometimes inclined to be|lieve recoverable, if its inhabitants, or rather government, could only be wi&s;e enough to pre&s;erve an intimate connection with England, and their enmity to Spain. Thence might proceed motives to u&s;eful exertion. By &s;ome wi&s;e mini&s;ter, bred in England, they might in time obtain a free and fixed con&s;titution of government, as the only means of duration and pro&s;perity for this little nation and its colonies.

<P>But again, when we view human &s;ociety on the other &s;ide, and contemplate the nu|merous cau&s;es of decline, as tho&s;e of bad education; the predominance of the &s;elfi&s;h principles over the benevolent; public abu&s;es which by &s;o many ways creep in and multiply each other; the difficulties of com|bining liberty with &s;ecurity, &s;ufficient to awaken and &s;upport indu&s;try; and even where the&s;e are once e&s;tabli&s;hed, we &s;ee arts and luxury, &s;cience, dependence, and &s;lavery, grow up together, or the wi&s;dom

of ages de&s;troyed by one fooli&s;h mea&s;ure, or mini&s;ter: the &s;tandard of virtue, to which all mu&s;t in &s;ome degree conform, we &s;ee varying every age; at one time rigid and &s;avage, at another refined and relaxing, as ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition re|tire to make way for knowledge and vici|ous indulgence; and thence the gradual decline of all public &s;pirit, which &s;oon be|comes in&s;ufficient to contend with the pri|vate views and efforts of a few, to whom the many are at la&s;t &s;ubdued, &s;o as to bani&s;h again the &s;pirit of labour and exertion; till by degrees the pre&s;ent civilized and culti|vated countries become the prey of de&s;pot|i&s;m and barbarous de&s;erts once more, and thence new nations ari&s;e. So that we &s;ee the moral world is probably more &s;ubject to great, though gradual revolutions, than the natural. This circle mu&s;t perhaps be often repeated, and the hi&s;tory of all be well pre&s;erved, before we can e&s;tabli&s;h right principles on which &s;tability and im|provement at once depend.</P>
<P><PB N="486" REF="492">Societies can never be formed by perfect wi&s;dom. Colonies from cultivated nations may have &s;ome advantages; and we ac|cordingly find tho&s;e few, within the period of hi&s;tory, to have made the quicke&s;t and greate&s;t progre&s;s; as the A&s;iatic Greeks, Carthage, the Roman colonies, North America. But as they mu&s;t always retain &s;ome of their native vices, as well as im|provements, they mu&s;t therefore, perhaps, come &s;ooner to decay. Some think that modern Europe may be already pa&s;t her meridian, and now on the decline; and that our &s;y&s;tems of government and re|ligion are not capable of greater advances than what we have &s;een. Neighbouring nations gradually a&s;&s;imilate, though &s;low|ly; but whether towards the be&s;t or the wor&s;t among them, may yet be doubtful; whether tho&s;e that ri&s;e, or tho&s;e that de|cline draw the re&s;t after them; whether he that &s;ubdues men by arms, artifice, or corruption, may not have more imitators than their greate&s;t benefactors who render them indu&s;trious, free, and happy: One warlike de&s;pot mu&s;t produce others,

It is certainly of import|ance to know on what the &s;pirit of indu&s;try, of improvement, and duration, depends. If there be a principle of univer&s;al efficacy throughout the moral as well as phy&s;ical world, it &s;eems to be that of mutual control.

Hither|to we have probably been &s;omewhat mi&s;|taken in both.

by ignorant and de&s;igning empirics. We have certainly done more than all the other nations towards the di&s;covering and laying open the <HI>arcana</HI> of this great art; and it is rather &s;urpri&s;ing that other legi&s;lators have not been more &s;olicitous to make u&s;e of our practical di&s;coveries. The wi&s;dom and oeconomy of a political principle, like tho&s;e of nature, mu&s;t be e&s;timated on the number and merits of the different pur|po&s;es it is calculated to an&s;wer. Some of tho&s;e a&s;cribed to our great Alfred, by their duration, and being &s;till the be&s;t parts of our police, &s;eem to have been dictated by the true legi&s;lative &s;pirit.

Though both maybe nece&s;|&s;ary, and each want the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the other, and the latter may be impo&s;&s;ible alone; yet if either, and only one of them, were to be had, the latter would probably be the be&s;t government of the two, if it could be prevented from declining into de&s;|poti&s;m. As laws advance and multiply,
<PB N="489" REF="495">
manners have often been ob&s;erved to de|cline. The be&s;t &s;y&s;tem would be that which produced the mo&s;t wi&s;e and good men.

But even when men remain, or are re|duced by oppre&s;&s;ion to the lowe&s;t &s;tate, to indolent, &s;elfi&s;h, and malevolent beings, or to the character of &s;laves, they are rarely even then &s;o bad as their &s;uperiors affect to con&s;ider them; and they might be more readily improved by gentle and confidential treatment, than by loads of penal laws, which only make them wor&s;e; or by multi|plying their chains as they become le&s;s able to break or to bear them.

<P>Your doubts concerning the decline of Europe are very natural. I am glad you reflect on &s;uch comprehen&s;ive &s;ubjects. It may depend much on what we call acci|dent. Though the torrent of manners is not to be &s;topped, yet we &s;ometimes &s;ee a &s;ingle event, or an individual, may give a turn to the tide. A &s;ingle battle, a Pitt, a Frederic, or a North American revolution, may give a con&s;iderable bias to opinions, to many nations, and to an age. Yes; the improvements in war are as nece&s;&s;ary, and con&s;titute as e&s;&s;ential a part of the whole advancement of the &s;pecies, as tho&s;e of any other art; and are nece&s;&s;ary to the pre|&s;ervation of &s;ociety, and of all the other arts. As war improves, conque&s;ts become more difficult. The taking a town may co&s;t greater time and expence now than formerly a kingdom.</P>
<P>Your project and manner of travelling to improve the world as well as your&s;elf, may do well enough as a half &s;erious joke.

There have been people romantic enough to accompany you; but I doubt your find|ing any &s;uch at pre&s;ent, except perhaps &s;ome <HI>odd man</HI> in your own i&s;land. Where|ever you go, I think you will find that the art which mo&s;t impedes all the re&s;t, is that of government. Till the true legi&s;lative &s;pirit revive, the world cannot advance; nor till the few nations that you &s;ee im|prove only by that &s;pirit, can carry the re&s;t along with them.

But there may be &s;ome hope for po&s;terity.

You may, in time, be able to judge whether the chances are in favour of good education and public virtue, or the contrary; how long the abu&s;es of tyranny may be re&s;trained by mutual fear and &s;hame, or by a livelier &s;en&s;e of honour and ju&s;tice, or by gentler man|ners, than formerly; whether the decline of morals may not accompany the progre&s;s of arts and knowledge, and the people be

We know from hi&s;tory the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;uch a progre&s;s.

and this meets with &s;o great approbation, that I dread a decline, and that we may be encouraged to go on refining and orna|menting till we arrive at a depraved ta&s;te in writing, as in the other arts, for they are all connected.

<P>Three things I have yet to recommend to you young travellers, and your friends: The fir&s;t is, the common injunction of ac|quiring a general knowledge of your own country before you leave it, which I fear is not yet much better executed for being often repeated and generally known. Secondly, for you who have wives and fa|milies,

or female relations, to take them with you, if po&s;&s;ible; or to join &s;ome family party. The ladies and a dome&s;tic way of life will oblige you to become acquainted with many things and per&s;ons, of con&s;e|quence to a knowledge of the world, and which you would overlook in running through a country <HI>en gar&ccedil;on.</HI> The third is, to fix your re&s;idence for a time in &s;ome part of a country before you begin to exa|mine it, for many and obvious rea&s;ons. By this mode of mixing re&s;idence with travel, you may acquire a knowledge of &s;ome countries, and make up, as it were, in depth what may be wanting in di&s;tance.

<HEAD>A LETTER FROM JERSEY. To A. J.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
<DATE>Nov. 1787.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I AM glad to &s;ee you, and others, be|coming more intere&s;ted and active in promoting the pro&s;perity of our di&s;tant coa&s;ts and i&s;lands, and that both the public and individual attention may in time reach the appendages and extremities of the king|dom; &s;o that the lo&s;s of a di&s;tant empire may po&s;&s;ibly be attended with the improve|ment of that at home, which is probably of far more importance to us. The&s;e i&s;lands in our channel, which we &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;s, are certainly of great utility and credit to us as a commercial and maritime nation. The whole clu&s;ter of i&s;les that form the Briti&s;h
<PB N="506" REF="512">
empire, has of late begun to feel and to &s;hew a progre&s;s and degree of power un|known before, and if they could all be properly united and governed, and public wi&s;dom accompany the progre&s;s of the other arts, they may in a century more &s;erve the world as a pattern, and contribute more than all the other nations towards improving the re&s;t of mankind. But this empire cannot probably exert above half its beneficial influence on the world, nor can its internal improvements advance with above half the celerity of which they are capable, till all its parts are properly united in one well-balanced legi&s;lature. The quick and progre&s;&s;ive ri&s;e and improve|ment of the nation, &s;ince the union of the principal i&s;land, has been very remarkable; and let us hope the re&s;t, Ireland not ex|cepted, will all in time be &s;o united in a &s;imilar, or perhaps a better and more inti|mate manner, as &s;cience and liberal prin|ciples &s;hall gradually prevail over prejudice and ignorance. The&s;e &s;maller i&s;lands that &s;urround the greater &s;hould certainly be &s;o
<PB N="507" REF="513">
united and repre&s;ented. The di&s;tant parts of the empire require perhaps a greater pro|portion of the public attention and encou|ragement than the re&s;t, in order to bring them nearer to a par with the more central parts for their mutual benefit: and it af|fords plea&s;ure to &s;ee &s;uch maxims begin to prevail, and hopes that even the Highlands of Scotland will not be much longer ne|glected. And let not the liberal minds give up in de&s;pair, though they &s;hould be repeatedly di&s;appointed. The different at|tempts and di&s;appointments will not be en|tirely lo&s;t. They call the public attention, and produce repeated di&s;cu&s;&s;ions: men are thence better prepared to take advantage of accidents. Ignorance, public abu&s;es, and the remains of feudal tyranny, may thus in time be gradually overcome, and at length be bani&s;hed even from the extremities of all the Briti&s;h dominions.</P>
<P>The numerous beauties of this little i&s;land I &s;hall not attempt to de&s;cribe. The rocky promontories, and exten&s;ive amphitheatrical
<PB N="508" REF="514">
&s;andy bays of its coa&s;t, the internal little &s;hady vales and &s;treams, are all remarkably beautiful. The whole is perhaps too much covered with wood; the divi&s;ions of the land too &s;mall: the numerous fences plant|ed with trees, together with the roads, oc|cupy probably one-fourth of the i&s;land. The &s;ea &s;eems gaining on the we&s;t end, near St. Owen's Bay. The natural hi&s;tory and pro|duce would require more attention than we can &s;pare, and probably de&s;erve it. The&s;e i&s;lands are obviou&s;ly the tops of marine mountains, and &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the Pyren&eacute;es, &amp;c. con&s;i&s;ting of a few dif|ferent kinds of perhaps primitive rock, thrown up in confu&s;ed heaps or &s;hattered ma&s;&s;es. Where any &s;trata are perceptible, they are nearly perpendicular to the horizon.</P>
<P>Of the &s;tate of &s;ociety and government, I &s;hall only give you a few of my u&s;ual loo&s;e remarks. The&s;e i&s;lands have been held as a remnant of Normandy, by what accidental care and good fortune it is need|le&s;s here to trace. Their form of govern|ment
<PB N="509" REF="515">
is an old feudal ari&s;tocracy, e&s;tabli&s;h|ed by king John, with the legi&s;lative, the judicial, and, for a time, the executive powers, in the &s;ame body of people, as was the mode in tho&s;e times of war and ignorance. They have been con&s;idered as belonging not to our legi&s;lature, but to the crown, and have generally been under the admini&s;tration or &s;uperintendence of the privy council, which is not I believe allow|ed to be very well con&s;tituted even for a court of law; how well calculated to be a legi&s;lative body I will not pretend to de|termine. The mo&s;t democratic govern|ment mu&s;t perhaps become ari&s;tocratic in &s;ome degree; the degree and form of which is of great importance. When it can be properly divided into an upper and lower part, &s;eparate, independent, and nearly balanced, and under the control properly limited of one head, the &s;y&s;tem may become nearly complete: but here, the two latter are defective. The upper and lower parts, the Peers and Commons, &s;it together, and the ari&s;tocratic part com|monly governs, as u&s;ual in this form: the
<PB N="510" REF="516">
yet ill-defined powers of the head is divid|ed between a governor and a baily, who generally act by deputies. This <HI>&s;imulacre</HI> of a con&s;titution deceives at fir&s;t view with &s;ome appearance of control and balance, of forms, elections, judges; but the&s;e are chiefly fallacies, and the whole has been too often found to be little better than a tyrannical ari&s;tocracy. The &s;tates or legi&s;|lature con&s;i&s;ts of twelve jurats, elected by the whole i&s;land for life,&mdash;of twelve clergy, and of twelve members called con&s;tables, one elected by each pari&s;h for three years, with the lieutenant-baily who holds the &s;tates. The clergy are probably the be&s;t informed part of this legi&s;lature, and can have but few intere&s;ted views. Where there are no places or preferment for them, and their livings being very &s;mall, it &s;eems their intere&s;t to be popular among their pari&s;hioners; they are generally now on the &s;ide of the people, and &s;eem to be pro|portionally di&s;liked by the &s;eigneurs. Their bi&s;hop, <HI>viz.</HI> of Winche&s;ter, &s;urely ought to vi&s;it them &s;ometimes, and they &s;hould have more &s;tudents at our univer&s;ities, where
<PB N="511" REF="517">
there is only a &s;canty provi&s;ion of three fellow&s;hips, and twelve poor &s;cholar&s;hips, for the two i&s;lands. The judicial power, or royal court, is only a certain number of the jurats, who, in this capacity, cannot be expected always to forget their political or party &s;pirit; and accordingly they have often u&s;ed their judicial power to promote their political views and influence, and cau&s;es are frequently decided in favour of their own party. As legi&s;lators, or as judges, they are placed in a cruel and difficult &s;itua|tion, and if they have been &s;ometimes ty|rannical and unju&s;t, their political con&s;titu|tion is perhaps more in fault than they.</P>
<P>In order to procure ju&s;tice and freedom, the efficient government, of whatever form, &s;hould be under &s;ome control, or it will degenerate into tyranny:&mdash;&s;uch is man. This ari&s;tocracy has been formerly long in the habits of governing without any &s;ufficient re&s;traint; and though a &s;pirit of liberty and oppo&s;ition has at length found its way hither, and the jurats have lo&s;t their great influence in the &s;tates, yet they may
<PB N="512" REF="518">
again recover it, and re&s;ume their wonted de&s;potic &s;way, if the privy council &s;hould be too partial to the ari&s;tocratic part. Their pre&s;ent &s;ituation, full of perpetual &s;truggles between the governing and po|pular parties, creates violent heats and ani|mo&s;ities, and threatens dangerous confu&s;ion, as u&s;ual in &s;mall places, e&s;pecially if no umpire of &s;ufficient authority and influence is pre&s;ent to decide the conte&s;t, and with wi&s;dom enough to pre&s;erve the balance. The re&s;toring and &s;upporting their ancient tyranny can hardly now be intended, as &s;ome of them &s;u&s;pect, being a mea&s;ure &s;o highly unworthy an Engli&s;h government, and could only be effected by &s;uch violent means as would in the&s;e days di&s;grace any nation. The only remedy is to mend their con&s;titution, and give them &s;ome Engli&s;h laws, which is now much de&s;ired by many Juries, in the way which they them&s;elves propo&s;e, and which were anciently in u&s;e here as in Normandy, would probably an&s;wer well enough for them, <HI>viz.</HI> in ca&s;es where de&s;ired by the parties. It may be alleged, that in &s;uch &s;mall places their de|ci&s;ions
<PB N="513" REF="519">
would &s;till be only the voice of party; but the&s;e, by being generally the opinion of a majority, would probably be nearly and often right, and would be le&s;s partial than the judgment of arbitrary and intere&s;ted magi&s;trates.</P>
<P>Such a ba&s;ele&s;s fabric as this old French ari&s;tocracy is not now long to be &s;upported, and was only practicable in the hands of wi&s;dom or artifice, and experience; but mu&s;t crumble to pieces if it &s;hould repeat|edly fall under the guidance of folly, vanity, pa&s;&s;ion, or inexperience, and &s;till more if under all the&s;e together.</P>
<P>It might be owing to the tyranny, in|&s;ufficiency, or non-re&s;idence of former go|vernors, that their power has been divid|ed: the civil part has been given to a baily who holds the &s;tates, &amp;c. by deputy; and little el&s;e be&s;ides the military part, re|mains to the governor. Unle&s;s the&s;e two chance to be very wi&s;e and temperate men, they mu&s;t be at perpetual war. In the body politic, there is no &s;upplying the want or deficiency of a head: every &s;ub&s;titute or contrivance for that purpo&s;e
<PB N="514" REF="520">
can form only a mon&s;ter which cannot live long. It is better there be always a nece&s;&s;ity for a good head, to oblige &s;ove|reigns to look out for proper governors, and not indulge them in thinking their fools or favourites &s;ufficient. Be&s;ides, we &s;hould attend to the change of times and manners for many obvious rea&s;ons. Even proper military lieutenant-governors may now perhaps be more ea&s;ily found than lieutenant-bailies above mediocrity, or &s;uf|ficiently qualified for the head of &s;uch a &s;tate. The army may now produce as many men of &s;ufficient probity, honour, and general knowledge, as any other line of life. It is not to be ea&s;ily under&s;tood why we have been &s;o backward in giving the&s;e people the &s;ame kind of government with our other i&s;lands, by a governor, &s;enate, and a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>In every country and form of rule, there ought perhaps to be complaints and abu&s;es enough to feed and maintain an oppo&s;ition as a watch and control upon power; and when oppo&s;ition is increa&s;ed to a ma|jority, by the increa&s;e of abu&s;es, they are thus often redre&s;&s;ed. This oppo&s;ition having
<PB N="515" REF="521">
of late grown up to a majority, under every di&s;advantage, marks that it is high time to change and improve their con&s;titu|tion. Though the&s;e poor people may not have &s;o much to complain of as they ima|gine, or as might be expected under &s;o imperfect a government; though they may naturally magnify their own evils and &s;uf|ferances; yet they ought &s;urely to have at lea&s;t &s;ome of them redre&s;&s;ed. They might &s;ucceed better, perhaps in every &s;en&s;e, with more patience and moderation; but the&s;e qualities may be more difficult to acquire in proportion to the &s;mallne&s;s of the &s;o|ciety, and defective form of its con&s;titu|tion. This is not a government of laws, but of per&s;ons, which u&s;ually degenerates into tyranny. They can hardly indeed be &s;aid to have any laws, except a few orders of council, and &s;ome vague and uncertain old cu&s;toms, which are naturally neglected and forgotten by an arbitrary government. But &s;ince Colonel Campbell, their lieu|tenant-governor in 1761, fir&s;t encouraged an oppo&s;ition to the reigning magi&s;trates, their minds and views have been gradually opening, and they have caught a little of
<PB N="516" REF="522">
that &s;pirit of freedom and di&s;cu&s;&s;ion which &s;urrounds them in Europe; and it &s;eems rather &s;urpri&s;ing, that our government has not yet encouraged their efforts, nor &s;econd|ed that gentleman's benevolent endeavours, and has been &s;o remi&s;s in granting them more of our laws and con&s;titution. How|ever, their legi&s;lative ideas &s;eem to be ad|vancing by their contentions, more than for centuries before. The principles and improvements of the age mu&s;t probably, in time, reach the&s;e i&s;lands.</P>
<P>Though they may yet be con&s;idered as children in politics, and unfit to govern them&s;elves; though they may not all &s;uf|ficiently con&s;ider the long gradation ne|ce&s;&s;ary to perfection in dome&s;tic policy, nor the difficulties, or rather impo&s;&s;ibility of adopting, at once, all the laws and con|&s;titution of England, which have required the progre&s;&s;ion of ages to attain the pre&s;ent degree of excellence, and which their &s;tate is not yet ripe for; this perhaps ought to co&s;t them much time and pains, and mu&s;t prove the re&s;ult of gradual experience. However, &s;ome of them are &s;en&s;ible of this,
<PB REF="523">
and wi&s;h it to be gradual. You might begin either by granting them the juries they de&s;ire, or by improving their con&s;titu|tion only by a &s;mall alteration in its form; by &s;eparating the &s;tates into two hou&s;es, with a governor only; and the other ne|ce&s;&s;ary changes would gradually follow of cour&s;e. To do this in the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t temperate manner, &s;end them proper com|mi&s;&s;ioners fir&s;t to examine and report.</P>
<P>Many think the form of government im|material, if the people are contented. You know I do not think &s;o; but even that excu&s;e for &s;tanding &s;till, or for checking the natural human progre&s;s, will probably &s;oon be removed; for much of the world &s;eem now to be changing their ideas very fa&s;t on the&s;e &s;ubjects. In this progre&s;s, the wi&s;e&s;t rulers will give way to &s;ome of the inevitable innovations, and will attempt only to limit the degree, and re&s;train the impetuo&s;ity, but not forcibly oppo&s;e the carrying of &s;ome &s;peculations into practice. If any of them are really great, the&s;e will &s;tep forward and become the leaders of temperate reformation; they will e&s;tabli&s;h and repair, but not de&s;troy &s;y&s;tems, and will become great legi&s;lators, and the re|founders
<PB N="518" REF="524">
of la&s;ting nations. The gradual improvement of man, of the &s;ociety or the &s;pecies, is an intere&s;ting progre&s;s, in which the knowledge of his own errors is the fir&s;t &s;tep; and to which the theories, and even hints of &s;peculation, and the facts of experience, are all equally nece&s;&s;ary and conducive. In this progre&s;s, political and legi&s;lative knowledge &s;eems to be the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary, and hitherto the mo&s;t deficient. But all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;uch knowledge cannot perhaps be expected till education is better under&s;tood, nor till theory is more generally joined with practice, &s;tudy with experience and travel. I could &s;ometimes wi&s;h no man to be admitted as a magi&s;trate, more than a pa&s;tor, who had not pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome certain degree or examination at an univer&s;ity, if we did not &s;ee that numbers may take that road and bring away very little u&s;eful &s;cience: and yet &s;ome of the&s;e may become even mini&s;ters of &s;tate long before they know on what the pro&s;perity of a nation depends. Such knowledge is not to be found ready for u&s;e in books and college lectures, nor in the huge volumes of the law, however nece&s;&s;ary the&s;e may be, as a foundation for experience to build
<PB N="519" REF="525">
upon. Hence our political and commer|cial principles have been &s;o often deficient. It may require yet much more time, and a more general information, to bani&s;h all the remains of our monopolizing corpora|tion ideas of commerce and balance of trade, founded on opinions and &s;entiments unworthy a Jew pedler, <HI>viz.</HI> on a mean jealou&s;y of all the world, and wi&s;hing no nation to have a profit or favourable balance but our&s;elves; and it was &s;hameful to &s;ee mini&s;ters, not very long ago, rea&s;oning from the ideas of the meane&s;t monopoli&s;t, de&s;irous that other nations &s;hould take our manufactures, and make nothing for them|&s;elves that &s;hould enable them to pay us: whereas it might ea&s;ily be &s;hewn that the highe&s;t cultivation and indu&s;try of the world would proportionally increa&s;e the commerce of all nations. From the &s;ame kind of narrow principles have proceed|ed much of our politics of late, endea|vouring to engro&s;s the trade and depend|ence of colonies and di&s;tant countries, to our mutual di&s;advantage. It is to be feared there are &s;till &s;ome who think we were wrong in permitting to our colonies &s;uch good forms of government by which they
<PB N="520" REF="526">
pro&s;pered &s;o fa&s;t, and became more inde|pendent on our caprices; but chiefly by our own folly and tyranny they were &s;e|parated from us before their time. Tho&s;e people would have had us imitate Spain, and &s;ecure the dependence of our colonies by their poverty and depopulation. Will it be believed by po&s;terity, that &s;uch &s;enti|ments prevailed in the fir&s;t nation of the world during the eighteenth century? Such maxims and events are certainly of hi&s;tori|cal importance, and &s;hould be held up to po&s;terity in their proper colours. But let us hope our public councils will now im|prove, as general knowledge and more li|beral legi&s;lative principles gradually prevail in the world, and that the times are nearly pa&s;t which produced &s;tamp acts, Quebec bills, and &s;uch proceedings as lo&s;t us an empire. Let us give way, or rather take the lead in the improvements of the age. My&s;tery and oppre&s;&s;ion cannot long &s;ub|&s;i&s;t, nor &s;ucceed as hitherto, in the&s;e in|ve&s;tigating and enlightened times, and mu&s;t probably be gradually relinqui&s;hed, and bani&s;hed from the art of governing man|kind. How much better to lead than be
<PB N="521" REF="527">
driven, and to be&s;tow in time with a good grace what mu&s;t at length be, as it were, extorted by the general voice? Even when a Conway &s;hall be no more, though vir|tue and &s;cience &s;hall then drop a tear, other friends to liberty and ju&s;tice will ari&s;e, to &s;upport and extend their reviving princi|ples, and who will lead your long-neglect|ed i&s;landers into the general legi&s;lature, or to all the benefits of the Briti&s;h laws and government. There is a kind of liberality, which is the highe&s;t wi&s;dom, in politics, and though not yet much known, may in time prevail. Let us be timely wi&s;e, and grant pro&s;perity to the remote&s;t parts of the empire, at pre&s;ent di&s;intere&s;tedly, for their benefit, but which will in time re&s;ult to the good of the whole. The political heart, that &s;hall freely circulate blood and life to the extremities, will have it returned with double vigour and advantage. Grant them, by degrees, all the freedom, immunities, and good government they de&s;ire; you will reap the profit in the cour&s;e of time, and of their natural progre&s;s, without any of the mercantile in&s;idious arts or monopoliz|ing &s;tipulations.</P>
<P><PB N="522" REF="528">I think I find here mo&s;t of my old poli|tical principles confirmed by experience, and on a &s;cale neither too &s;mall for fair ex|periment, nor too large for the eye to take in by comparative views, nor too full of uncertainty from the complication of dif|ferent cau&s;es. In mo&s;t old e&s;tabli&s;hments, in all unfair modes of government, but e&s;pecially in ari&s;tocracies, there is a natural tendency to keep things as they are, and hence to exclude almo&s;t all improvements by which the rulers fear they may chance to lo&s;e &s;ome power or influence. They are naturally jealous of the merchant, the manufacturer, the rich <HI>bourgeois</HI> or <HI>par|venus,</HI> and of every innovator or improver. Here, they are accordingly jealous even of the commerce that would finally enrich them&s;elves, and of the very learning and the &s;chools that would enlighten and im|prove all. This is the &s;mall working model of a great nation. We &s;ee human nature at work as we do bees through the gla&s;s hive. There doubtle&s;s mu&s;t always be a difference of rank among men in &s;o|ciety; but on the proper regulation and limitation of that difference will depend
<PB N="523" REF="529">
much of their progre&s;s and political hap|pine&s;s. Whether the people are mo&s;t happy in &s;lavery or in freedom, was once di&s;put|ed in the countries that are now the free&s;t and mo&s;t civilized, and is di&s;puted &s;till in Ru&s;&s;ia, Poland, the We&s;t Indies, &amp;c. That they are more active and indu&s;trious with liberty and &s;ecurity, can now hardly be doubted. In every &s;ociety there is a na|tural tendency and progre&s;&s;ion towards an injurious difference, an increa&s;ing inequa|lity in rank and riches. The be&s;t govern|ments will be known by their contriving ju&s;t and gentle limits and ob&s;tructions to this evil, and that &s;hall rai&s;e and &s;upport the poor and helple&s;s again&s;t the rich and powerful, between whom there is always a &s;ecret, but very unequal war and enmity. We may doubt if there be any govern|ment yet e&s;tabli&s;hed, that is completely adequate to this ta&s;k, but we may pre&s;ume that our own comes the neare&s;t to it, and may hope it will come nearer &s;till. But I am perhaps too ea&s;ily led into general reflections, in &s;earch of practical truths, and principles of importance. You know
<PB N="524" REF="530">
I con&s;ider the art or &s;cience of legi&s;lation as yet in its infancy.</P>
<P>The things that are wanting to make the&s;e poor i&s;landers as happy as nature al|lows, may be few though e&s;&s;ential. A mediocrity, rather bordering on poverty, with a purity and &s;implicity of manners, &s;eem to prevail here. A divi&s;ion of pro|perty, uncommonly minute, provides a &s;ort of independent &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for a greater number than is almo&s;t anywhere to be found on an equal &s;pace of territory. The ancient &s;lavi&s;h conditions of &s;ome of their tenures &s;hould be aboli&s;hed, as the labour due to the <HI>&s;eigneur,</HI> and the corn rents, &amp;c. The&s;e few &s;mall alterations, with the trials by jury, &s;ome Engli&s;h laws, and perhaps members of parliament, may form nearly the &s;um of what they want at pre|&s;ent; as the&s;e would gradually bring the other requi&s;ites towards making them more indu&s;trious, populous, and more import|ant i&s;lands to England. Their poor and par&s;imonious appearance, and modes of living, of dre&s;s, of farming, their uten&s;ils, manners, &amp;c. &s;eem all as yet a little too much in the French &s;tyle. They ought
<PB N="525" REF="531">
&s;urely, by this time, to have been more like Engli&s;h people. Our government has certainly been the mo&s;t to blame in this. I doubt we are con&s;titutionally inadequate or unfit for the management of foreign po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, till they are incorporated in our legi&s;lature, and thence all become gra|dually &s;ubject to the &s;ame laws. A large proportion of the men here go to &s;ea, while their &s;mall po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions are but indif|ferently cultivated. Under better govern|ment, laws, and tenures, this uncommon junction of the trades of &s;ailor and farmer might be &s;eparated, and both &s;ucceed better; with many other beneficial effects, as more activity, education, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This i&s;land may be con&s;idered as a model in &s;ome e&s;&s;entials, and worthy the imitation of greater &s;tates; as in the mi|litary arrangements, and &s;y&s;tem of defence, which have been &s;o highly improved, and almo&s;t formed <HI>de novo,</HI> by the pre&s;ent go|vernor, General Conway, whom the&s;e people &s;tyle their father and defender. The whole of the inhabitants, of all ranks, have been formed into an excellent militia, in which there are many points that &s;hew the very rare degree of military &s;cience of the in|&s;titutor,
<PB N="526" REF="532">
as well as his towers, and the whole &s;y&s;tematic defence of the coa&s;t. I think the uniform he has given them here, the jacket and long trow&s;ers, is the be&s;t mi|litary dre&s;s I have yet &s;een, and an&s;wers all the purpo&s;es we want. The&s;e, with the artillery part of each corps, and &s;everal other regulations, are highly worthy of imitation. To complete the &s;y&s;tem, a place of &s;trength is wanting; one that &s;hould &s;tand a &s;iege of a certain time, and that could be readily &s;upplied and relieved by &s;ea, which is a chief object in every fortification for us, and indeed the only circum&s;tance that can now render a place impregnable, &s;uch as Tyre, Bergenop|zoom, Gibraltar, might be made. A harbour, protected by the fort, might like|wi&s;e be formed, for frigates at lea&s;t, as the&s;e might be of &s;ignal &s;ervice &s;o &s;tation|ed, particularly at the beginning of a war. The importance of the&s;e i&s;lands to Eng|land, as advanced po&s;ts, &amp;c. need not, I hope, be here demon&s;trated to you. In the civil wars, you know they remained firmly loyal, and by their annoyance of the Parliament's forces by &s;ea, &s;hewed what
<PB N="527" REF="533">
mi&s;chief they might do us in the hands of an enemy. Charles II. knew their import|ance, and always ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed, when in the greate&s;t want of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to &s;ell them to France for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>It appears that the Druids re&s;orted much to the&s;e i&s;lands, as well as to Angle&s;ea. The ruins of above fifty of their monuments or temples have been di&s;covered here; one lately, very complete, which is going to be &s;ent to their Governor's at Park Place. The Druids were right. The&s;e &s;ecluded i&s;les were then well &s;uited for &s;tudy and meditation, and probably for their my&s;teri|ous wor&s;hip, and for &s;afety. This beauti|ful i&s;land, I think, even now well adapted for &s;tudy, and for education, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es many advantages for a good &s;chool, being the only place we know where French and Engli&s;h are &s;poken equally well by all ranks above the common and coun|try people. The courts of ju&s;tice, and law pleadings in French; the preaching in both languages, alternately: a plea&s;ant re|tired and healthy country; innocency and &s;implicity of manners; great oeconomy,
<PB N="528" REF="534">
with a mediocrity of wealth and condition; the inhabitants all prote&s;tants; little oeco|nomical tours to France with the &s;cholars might be ea&s;ily made. I know of no place abroad po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;o many advantages for an early education<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Here is Mr. Dupr&egrave;, bred at Oxford, mini&s;ter of the capital pari&s;h, a character every way qualified and ready for the office of chief ma&s;ter.

<P>I know of no good account publi&s;hed of the&s;e i&s;lands. That of Jer&s;ey, by the Rev. Mr. Falle, is ju&s;tly reckoned the be&s;t. Dr. Shebbeare has written a violent &s;currilous account of invective upon their late tran&s;ac|tions. He had good materials, the MS. of the late Mr. Le Geit, a re&s;pectable charac|ter, and well informed. The Doctor could write, and &s;eems to have wanted little more than a greater &s;hare of temper and modera|tion to have made a very good book of it; but he has made a very bad one.</P>
