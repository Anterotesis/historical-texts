<HEAD>THE LIFE OF JOHN TRUEMAN.</HEAD>
<P>MANY lives have been written of men famous in the world; the following is the life of a poor day-labourer, hardly known beyond his pari&s;h. His name was John Trueman. His father was a very hone&s;t man: but having nothing to live on, except his own labour; he had little to leave his &s;on, but his ble&s;&s;ing, and a good example.</P>
<P>When the old man died, John was a &s;ervant with farmer Clarke; who took an affection to him from his youth, and treated him like a child. With him he lived nine years, and &s;erved him faithfully; having never had any other ma&s;ter; for he did not like change. He was always a clever, active lad; never &s;pared him&s;elf; &s;erved his ma&s;ter as he would have &s;erved him&s;elf; never learned bad words; was always endea|vouring, in his &s;pare time, to improve him|&s;elf in reading, and writing; and was &s;uch
<PB N="2" REF="4">a lover of truth, that I have heard farmer Clarke &s;ay, he never told him a lye in his life. Whether it made for him or again&s;t him, (the farmer u&s;ed to &s;ay,) all came out, ju&s;t as it was. This is a very good property in a young lad; and almo&s;t a &s;ure &s;ign, that he will turn out well.</P>
<P>While John Trueman lived with farmer Clarke, he made a &s;trict friend&s;hip with one of his fellow-&s;ervants, who&s;e name was An|drew Wilkins. Andrew was a good lad; and liked his ma&s;ter: but having a quarrel with the carter, who was a &s;urly fellow, he left his place, and took on with old Mi|chael&s;on, the thatcher. He was quiet, &s;o|ber, and indu&s;trious; and John and he &s;till kept up their acquaintance; tho they did not often meet together.</P>
<P>In July 1730, farmer Clarke died; and having no children, he left what he had, about 100l. among his relations. He con|&s;idered John as one of them; and left him 10l.</P>
<P>John was now about twenty-five years of age, and having a few pounds, which he had &s;aved, be&s;ides his legacy, he furni&s;hed a neat little cottage on the &s;ide of the common; and &s;oon afterwards, when he had gotten into good work, married Betty Meadows, a pru|dent young woman in the neighbourhood.</P>
<P>A little before this time old Michael&s;on died; (poor fellow, he hurt him&s;elf by a fall
<PB N="3" REF="5">from farmer Rickman's barn, which he ne|ver got the better of) and Andrew Wilkins getting into all his work, was accounted the be&s;t thatcher in the Pari&s;h. He was &s;ent for to all the barns, and ricks in the neighbour|hood, and made a great deal of money. It was he, who thatched the farm hou&s;e at Ne|therwood; which was thought to be as good a piece of work as any that could be &s;een in ten pari&s;hes. John &s;till kept up his friend|&s;hip with him; but they &s;eldom &s;aw one another, except on Sundays; when they com|monly &s;taid, with two or three other young fellows of the pari&s;h, to &s;ing a little after &s;ervice, (for they were both good &s;ingers) and in &s;ummer would &s;ometimes take a walk together in the evening. The fir&s;t piece of work Andrew did, after he &s;et up for him&s;elf, was thatching John's cottage. He would take nothing for his labour; but John &s;oon after gave his little girl (a niece, who lived with him) a prayer book, and a new hat.</P>
<P>In this cottage John brought up a large family, three &s;ons, and four daughters. Yet he could never be &s;aid to have a family of &s;even children on his hands. They were &s;oon taught, as they grew up, one above another, to do &s;omething for their own main|tenance. His wife not only &s;pent frugally, what her hu&s;band earned by his labour; but likewi&s;e added to it by her own &s;pinning, and knitting; and that of her daughters.
<PB N="4" REF="6">Their money did not go to the grocer's for tea, and &s;ugar, and butter. They lived hard; but the children were tight, and the cottage neat. If a neighbour came in, Betty &s;till continued her work. She had no time for go&s;&s;ipping, and tea-drinking. She her&s;elf rarely went out, except to church; and now, and then to market with a few chickens, or a young goo&s;e. And yet, if &s;he could be of any u&s;e to a &s;ick neighbour, no|body was more ready. Many a piece of good advice, &s;he would give her neighbours, when &s;he thought they wanted it: and &s;he had that plea&s;ant way of giving advice, which always brought it home to the point &s;he aimed at; and yet without giving offence.</P>
<P>One day Mary Roper came in with a new &s;carlet cloak on, bordered very finely with a piece of white cat&s;kin. And, pray, how do you like my new cloak, &s;aid &s;he, Betty? I like it very well; &s;aid Betty; what might it co&s;t you? Fifteen &s;hillings, &s;aid Mary Ro|per, which I earned my&s;elf la&s;t augu&s;t, at the Squire's. Betty Trueman, continuing to turn her wheel, began carele&s;sly to enquire into the price of &s;hop-goods&mdash;what brown lin&s;ey was a yard?&mdash;what dowlas?&mdash;and how much cloth would make one of her girls a &s;hift? When &s;he had gotten all out of poor Mary, &s;he wi&s;hed; "Now, &s;aid &s;he, neigh|bour, (&s;topping her wheel,) I'll make free to tell you a piece of my mind. You &s;ee you
<PB N="5" REF="7">have &s;pent as much on a cloak, as would have bought nine yards of dowlas, and a good brown lin&s;ey cloak be&s;ides, which would have kept you as warm, as this &s;carlet one. If you had been as able as Mrs. Ivy&s;on, I &s;hould have thought it &s;uitable, and &s;hould have &s;aid never a word: but with &s;uch fa|milies, Mary, and &s;uch means, as you and I have, I &s;hould have been as much a&s;hamed of going about the pari&s;h with a &s;carlet cloak that co&s;t me fifteen &s;hillings, as I &s;hould have been of going about with three of my children's &s;hirts pinned to my back. Mary Roper, who did not &s;ee what her neighbour had been driving at, till it came &s;uddenly upon her, was very much hurt, and &s;aid &s;he would never put on her red cloak again, as long as &s;he lived. She &s;hould always think, when people looked at her, that they &s;aw three of her children's &s;hirts pinned to her back. Nay as to that, &s;aid Betty, as it is bought, you had better wear it: but &s;uch people as we, Mary, have nothing to do with finery. We &s;hould make every penny go as far as it can. Our chief &s;hew &s;hould be in keeping our children tight, and clean. As to the money's being of our own earn|ing, I think nothing of that: for why &s;hould not the mother's earnings go to main|tain the children, as well as the father's?"</P>
<P>In John Trueman's family every thing, that was earned by the father, the mother,
<PB N="6" REF="8">or the children, went all to one common &s;tock, and an&s;wered the be&s;t end: and though they were oftner than once vi&s;ited by &s;ick|ne&s;s (once five of them had the &s;mall pox to|gether,) yet they always got out of their difficulties them&s;elves; and never had a &s;in|gle farthing from the pari&s;h. In the mid&s;t of all their poverty John always contrived to have twenty or thirty &s;hillngs tied up in a bit of rag, again&s;t a rainy day. <HI>Nobody &s;hould live upon alms,</HI> he u&s;ed to &s;ay, <HI>but people who have lo&s;t the u&s;e of their hands, and feet.</HI></P>
<P>This worthy man not only &s;et his family an example of indu&s;try; but of every thing el&s;e, that was good. Nobody ever heard him &s;wear an oath. He had been brought up him&s;elf in the fear of God; and he brought up his family in the &s;ame way; teaching them to pray morning, and evening, to beg God's ble&s;&s;ing on each day; and to thank him at night for his mercies. He was &s;trictly hone&s;t &mdash;was gentle, and kind to every body&mdash;and was &s;o &s;ober, that I have heard him &s;ay, he had not been twice in an ale-hou&s;e during his life. He was a great enemy to ale-hou&s;es in general; but e&s;pecially to pot-hou&s;es
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The pot-hou&s;e &s;ells liquor without a licence, and is commonly more frequented by bad people.</NOTE>. He believed nothing corrupted young lads &s;o much; and u&s;ed to &s;ay, he wi&s;hed to have it written over the door of every one of them, in large letters, THIS IS THE DEVIL's SCHOOL.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="9">He always dete&s;ted the pot-hou&s;e: but particularly, at this time, he had the affliction to find, that it, and the ale-hou&s;e, had been the ruin of his friend Andrew Wilkins. Andrew had long been one of the &s;obere&s;t fellows in the pari&s;h; and perhaps might have continued &s;o, if he had had his friend John Trueman always at his elbow. He was one evening, again&s;t his inclination, &s;e|duced into a pot-hou&s;e. This was the be|ginning of all his misfortunes. Once going is a &s;tep towards going a &s;econd time; and a &s;econd time is two &s;teps; and leads directly to a third. Poor Andrew took &s;everal; and began to love liquor. Then it was over with him. John Trueman &s;aw very little of him; for he &s;eldom came to church. He next began to neglect his bu&s;ine&s;s: and it was then that young Simp&s;on got into the pari&s;h; and did mo&s;t of the thatching work. After this, poor Andrew began to run into debt. He owed three pounds at the chandler's &s;hop; twelve pounds at different ale hou&s;es, and pot-hou&s;es; and &s;even &s;hillings at the baker's. During the cour&s;e of all this mi&s;|chief, John Trueman often undertook to &s;et him to rights. "Come, my man, he would &s;ay, pluck up a good courage: leave the&s;e cur&s;ed hou&s;es: &s;et heartily to bu&s;ine&s;s; and you may yet do well." Now, and then poor Andrew made a faint endeavour: but he fell back again into his old haunts; till at length
<PB N="8" REF="10">his credit being gone, and his debts trouble|&s;ome, he ran off, and left the country.</P>
<P>In the mean time John Trueman increa&s;ed in reputation. He did not want the wicked amu&s;ement of drinking. In &s;ummer, after his work was over, he generally every day &s;pent half an hour, or perhaps an hour, in his little garden&mdash;planting his cabbages, and potatoes; hoeing the weeds; and &s;owing his beans and peas. His wife al&s;o per&s;uaded him to take a little field of a couple of acres behind the hou&s;e, were &s;he kept a cow, which &s;he bought out of the earnings of her &s;pinning; and &s;he found it an&s;wered very well. His garden, which was neatly kept, was one of his chief amu&s;ements: but the employment, in which he took mo&s;t delight, was the in&s;truction of his family. Seldom a day pa&s;&s;ed, in which he did not &s;pend a part, in teaching them their catechi&s;m, or hearing them read the bible, or &s;ome good little book, which the par&s;on u&s;ed to give them. It was a plea&s;ing &s;ight to &s;ee him &s;itting with the younger children, one on each knee; and the elder &s;tanding round him. Come, Jemmy, he would &s;ay to the elde&s;t boy, let your little brothers, and &s;i&s;ters hear how well you can &s;ay your book: and then he would make him repeat the creed, the Lord's prayer, or the commandments; and would a&s;k him &s;uch que&s;tions, as the mini&s;ter u&s;ed commonly to a&s;k at church. It was very plea&s;ant al&s;o to
<PB N="9" REF="11">hear John and his family &s;inging p&s;alms on a &s;unday evening, which they often did. John had an excellent ba&s;e voice; and among the re&s;t there were good tenors, and trebles. Indeed John was always thought at church the be&s;t of the band</P>
<P>He drew out al&s;o &s;everal texts of &s;cripture which he called <HI>Chri&s;t's catechi&s;m;</HI> and made all his children get them by heart. The mi|ni&s;ter, one day, &s;aw them; and &s;aid, he could not have cho&s;en them better him&s;elf. He was &s;o well plea&s;ed with them, that he had them printed out in a book; and made all the children of the pari&s;h get them by heart. In the end of this account I &s;hall give a copy of them.</P>
<P>Above all things this worthy man was cautious never to let his children play idly in the &s;treets on &s;undays. They were &s;ure, he &s;aid, to pick up bad words, or &s;omething or other, that was wicked. If they were ever &s;een with Bob Web&s;ter, or Jere Rymer, who&s;e fathers were breeding them up to the gallows, they were &s;ure of a whipping. But, in general, they were very good children; and rarely did any thing but what their father and mother allowed. Among other things, he &s;trictly forbad them to go out at night. The devil, he would &s;ay, takes that opportu|nity to lead young lads a&s;tray: they gene|rally begin by going out at nights.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="12">Either John or his wife, went always to church with the elder children. The other &s;tayed at home with the younger. No chil|dren in the pari&s;h were &s;o well behaved at church, as they. They always looked on their prayer-books; and minded what they were about. They took care al&s;o, be|fore they went into church, not to have oc|ca&s;ion to go out during the &s;ervice; which many little children do, and di&s;turb the con|gregation very much. As each of them got to the age of twelve years, their father gave them a prayer-book with gold edges; of which they were always mighty proud.</P>
<P>Thus educated, they not only &s;oon became u&s;eful; but had the choice of the be&s;t &s;er|vices in the country. Their father however would &s;uffer them only to go where the family was &s;ober, and regular; and the ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s &s;et a good example. "I have taken a great deal of pains," John would &s;ay, "with my children; and my re|ward is, to &s;ee them well &s;ettled. They can all work, I thank God; and are all willing; and I am in no fear of their getting a livelihood any where." This &s;pirit in the father gave the children credit and con|&s;equence. They had no occa&s;ion to <HI>&s;eek</HI> for places, they were always <HI>&s;ought after.</HI> Thus when lady Lumley wanted one of John's daughters for a hou&s;emaid; and &s;ent him
<PB N="11" REF="13">word by Mrs. Jack&s;on, that &s;he had inquired the young woman's character, and liked it very well; John next inquired the character of lady Lumley, and finding &s;he led a loo&s;e &s;ort of life, playing at cards on &s;undays, and keeping bad hours, John made a civil excu&s;e, and would not let Sally go to her. He cho&s;e rather to let her go to Mrs. Mears, a clergy|man's widow, who lived in the next town; tho &s;he gave only four pound wage; and lady Lumley gave &s;ix.</P>
<P>"You are now my dear child, (&s;aid John,) going from your good mother, who has al|ways given you the be&s;t advice. You mu&s;t now advi&s;e your&s;elf. I hope there is no oc|ca&s;ion to give you any in&s;truction about your duty to God, and reading your bible: I &s;hall only therefore give you a little about your new way of life. I have endeavoured to get you into a &s;ober family: but I may be de|ceived. If you &s;hould find it is not &s;o, give me a line; and I'll come over, and advi&s;e you. But if the family be a good one, as I believe it is, (for I have always heard Mrs. Mears, and the two mi&s;&s;es well &s;poken of) don't be ha&s;ty to leave them; tho you hear of other girls in the neighbourhood, who have le&s;s work, and higher wage. Work &s;eldom hurts a young woman in health: but lazine&s;s and idlene&s;s always do. And as to wage, trouble not your&s;elf &s;o much about that, as about getting a good character. Staying
<PB N="12" REF="14">long in a place is creditable. My good father u&s;ed always to &s;ay; <HI>A long &s;ervice is a good in|heritance;</HI> and I found his words true. Be|&s;ides, it is more profitable: for by going about from place to place, after greater wage, and being often out of place, you lo&s;e far more than you gain. Look at poor Bet Nixon. That girl has been in &s;even places within the&s;e two years; and by always trying to better her&s;elf, &s;he is now become as ragged as a colt. How different was Nancy Sel|wood. She lived nine years with good lady Burnaby; and was grown quite into her friend; and I have heard &s;ay, it co&s;t the old lady many a tear, when Nancy left her. But when her brother had taken that great farm, and had lo&s;t his wife, every body thought it right in Nancy to go to help him. She would not have left her old mi&s;tre&s;s for any other place, I dare be bound.</P>
<P>John then gave his daughter &s;ome advice again&s;t &s;aucine&s;s, and pertne&s;s, which he &s;aid an&s;wered no end. If you find, &s;aid he, you cannot live happy in your place, continue to do your duty in it, while you do &s;tay; and give warning quietly.</P>
<P>Before the girl went to Mrs. Mears, her mother al&s;o gave her a little advice about dre&s;s. "Now, Sally, &s;aid &s;he, I de&s;ire I may never &s;ee you follow any of tho&s;e &s;lovenly fa&s;hions, of letting your hair hang in great bags behind, and dangling in curls upon your
<PB N="13" REF="15">&s;houlders; and wearing dirty bits of gau&s;e ruffles, and handkerchiefs, and flapping caps, and bunches of na&s;ty ribbon about your hat. Such things do not become young wo|men at &s;ervice; nor any people in low &s;ta|tions. When you go to church, be always neat, and clean, and tight&mdash;at all times you may be tight: and when you buy any thing, let it be plain and good, rather than fine. If you were to come home &s;uch a &s;lattern figure as Betty Nixon was, when &s;he came from place, I &s;hould be quite a&s;hamed of you."</P>
<P>Nor was it only in his own family, that John was of u&s;e; he did many a kind action among his neighbours. His friendly di&s;po|&s;ition was &s;o well known, that wherever there was any di&s;tre&s;s, John Trueman was the fir&s;t per&s;on applied to. Many a day's work he gave up to &s;erve a friend. He was con&s;idered al&s;o as a very good judge among his neigh|bours; and put an end to many a quarrel. Sometimes al&s;o, though he was one of the mo&s;t peaceable men in the world, he was known to do ju&s;tice in a very &s;ummary manner him&s;elf, where the law was tardy; and its &s;entence could not ea&s;ily be obtained.</P>
<P>He and his &s;ons were at hay-cart. The field was full of people, both men and women: and among them was a tall raw-boned fellow, who as they were re&s;t|ing at noon, began to &s;wear, and talk
<PB N="14" REF="16">ob&s;cenely to the women. One of John's daughters was among them; and John was much hurt with the fellow's impudence; and two or three times rebuked him &s;martly. But though he turned the laugh upon him, he could not make him hold his tongue. On this John getting up very deliberately, and taking his cart-whip, gave the fellow a &s;macking cut round the body. A circular &s;tain about his &s;hirt, for he was without his jacket, &s;hewed how ably and dexterou&s;ly John had applied the la&s;h. Now, my good fellow, &s;aid John, remember never to &s;wear, and talk ob&s;cenely again, in company with John Trueman. The fellow &s;tarted up in a rage, and &s;natching up a pitchfork, &s;wore he would be revenged. Come, come, my man, &s;aid John, &s;it down quietly, and be civil: I have three &s;trapping lads here, who if you dare lift a finger at their old father, will drag you through yon hor&s;e-pond. Up &s;tart|ed the three lads in an in&s;tant, each with a pitchfork in his hand; and the fellow, not chu&s;ing to meddle with the old man, went off muttering, that if there were ju&s;tice to be had either for love, or money, he would have it.</P>
<P>John was a man of &s;uch good natural &s;en&s;e, and &s;o well informed for a common per&s;on, that he had always &s;omething to &s;ay that was proper on every occa&s;ion. If he ever heard a lad &s;wearing for in&s;tance; he would
<PB N="15" REF="17">tell him, &s;wearing was hard work, whatever he might think of it. It was working for the devil without wages. Thou'lt get nothing for thy labour, my lad, he would &s;ay: and why would&s;t thou do for the devil, what thou would'&s;t do for no ma&s;ter on earth?&mdash;Or if he &s;aw him going to the ale-hou&s;e, he would tell him, that a poor lad going into an ale-hou&s;e, always put him in mind of a &s;illy fi&s;h going to drink in a hoop|net. It is ea&s;y to get in; but he does not know how to find his way out again.&mdash;Or if he met him going to a hor&s;e-race&mdash;a mountebank&mdash;a cock-fight&mdash;or a conjurer, he had always &s;omething ready to &s;hew him his folly; and how much better it would be for him to mind his bu&s;ine&s;s.&mdash;How good a divine John was, the following little &s;tory will &s;hew.</P>
<P>He was mowing one day with Richard Willet&mdash;a fellow of the pari&s;h, who was never thought to be over fond of work; and as they were eating their dinner under the hedge, Lord B. came pa&s;t in his coach. Aye now, &s;ays Willet, there's a man that has &s;omething to thank God for. He has no|thing to do, but to ride about where he plea&s;es; and has a good dinner to go to at noon, and a cup of the be&s;t. While we, poor hearts, after a hard day's labour, are glad of a bit of cold bacon to our bread, and a drop of &s;our beer.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="18">How know you, &s;aid Trueman, that my Lord is happier, than you, or I? Is it riding about in a coach, think you, and eat|ing a good dinner, that makes a man happy? No, no, Dick, &s;omething el&s;e goes to make a man happy: he mu&s;t have <HI>happine&s;s within.</HI> If all be true, as I have heard, my Lord has been de&s;perate vexed, ever &s;ince the King turned him out of his place. And as he has diced away mo&s;t of what he had, as I have heard people tell, who have been in London, I &s;hould think he has not much happine&s;s to brag on.&mdash;But &s;uppo&s;e my Lord was ever &s;o happy, what then? Does that make us more unhappy? I dur&s;t lay a wager, there is as much happine&s;s in my cottage, as in Bromley-hall.&mdash;Be&s;ides, what matters it during the little while we live in this world, whether we are lords, or labourers? Did you ever hear, Dick, how far it is to France, or Scotland? And if you were going to one of tho&s;e places, would you think it was much, if the road, for half a dozen &s;teps &mdash;as far as to that gate for in&s;tance&mdash;was bad? Now it is ju&s;t the &s;ame with regard to this world, and the next. You have heard of eternity I &s;uppo&s;e. It is like a long journey, round and round the world, that will never have an end. Now as cer|tain, as you have that knife in your hand, Lord B. and you, and I, have all that jour|ney to take alike. We &s;hall all travel in
<PB N="17" REF="19">the &s;ame way. And what mighty difference does it make, if he go as far as that gate in a coach, and we on foot? At the gate Lord B. mu&s;t get out of his coach; and we &s;hall be all alike. Then happy he, who has done be&s;t. If we have lived well with our little, and done our duty, <HI>as to the Lord, and not unto man,</HI> God almighty will reward us, poor as we are, as much as he will reward my Lord, though he &s;hould have done what good he could with his better means. Then what will it &s;ignify how we have gone to the gate? Our bu&s;ine&s;s is to look to the long journey we have to go afterwards.</P>
<P>Thus this good couple lived, re&s;pected by every body, high, and low. It was a great plea&s;ure to the Squire's lady, and her daugh|ters, to take an evening walk to Betty True|man's, which was about a mile and a half from them. They u&s;ed to carry a little tea, and &s;ugar in their pockets; and were &s;ure of a piece of good hou&s;ehold bread, and a neat pat of butter. Often too they would bring their company with them; and the neigh|bours have &s;ometimes &s;een in a &s;ummer|evening a coach, or two &s;tanding at John's door.</P>
<P>About the year 1747 a very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing cir|cum&s;tance happened to this worthy family.</P>
<P>Betty Trueman had a brother in Wilt|&s;hire; who lived very creditably on a little farm on the edge of Marlborough-downs.
<PB N="18" REF="20">His wife died, and left him an only &s;on; who, as he grew up, proved a great di&s;tre&s;s to his father. He would &s;ettle to nothing. He kept bad company; u&s;ed bad words, and got a habit of drinking. About the be|ginning of march John Trueman was in|formed of his brother in law's death; and as he was left executor; he took a journey into Wilt&s;hire, to &s;ettle his affairs. The mo&s;t difficult thing he had to &s;ettle was young Tom Meadows, his nephew. What to do he knew not. To leave him, was ruin: to take him among his own young folks, was dangerous. After weighing the matter on all &s;ides, John thought, (di&s;tre&s;&s;ing as it was) he had no choice left, but to take the young man home; and try what he could do with him. John Trueman's man|ners were exceedingly plea&s;ing; and young Meadows had taken a great fancy to him. John had ob&s;erved it; and this was the chief foundation of his hopes; as he thought by kind treatment he might work upon him. He took him home therefore, and determin|ed to u&s;e him in all re&s;pects like one of his own &s;ons, while he behaved well. John, knowing that idlene&s;s is the beginning of all wickedne&s;s, took him always to work with him&s;elf. The young man could not help working, when he &s;aw his uncle work. By degrees, work became ea&s;y to him, and he could do a tolerable day's work. John's
<PB N="19" REF="21">&s;ons al&s;o commonly worked with them: and when they all came home at night, John had always &s;ome innocent merriment, to make the lads chearful, while &s;upper was getting ready. They generally worked by the great; and at the end of the job John divided the money into equal parts; and gave his nephew as much as he took him&s;elf; tho his work was by no means equal. He took of him likewi&s;e for his board, ju&s;t the &s;ame as he took of his own &s;ons; always telling him, that if he could do better, he was welcome. By treating him in this generous, kind man|ner, he daily gained more and more upon him: and the young man him&s;elf began to find more plea&s;ure in &s;obriety, and indu&s;try; than in drunkenne&s;s, and idlene&s;s. The ex|ample al&s;o of his cou&s;ins had great weight with him. He began to be intimate with them; and to be better plea&s;ed with the innocence, and chearfulne&s;s of their company, than with the rioting, &s;wearing, drinking, and ob|&s;cenity of his former companions. Not but that he once, or twice broke out&mdash; once particularly at the fair, when he met with one of his old friends: and two or three times his uncle heard an oath, and an ob&s;cene je&s;t come from him: but as he &s;aw that the young man, on the whole, meant to do well, he treated him with great kind|ne&s;s; and when he found fault with him, did it like a friend.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="22">Young Meadows had now been about four years with his uncle; and was come of age; when John took an opportunity, one day, to carry him into the fields privately; and thus &s;poke to him. "You know, Tom, you have often heard me &s;ay, I would do what I could to recover for you what little matters your father left: and every now, and then I told you, I was doing my be&s;t. I'll now tell you what I have done. After your father's debts were paid, (mo&s;t of which, I find, you occa&s;ioned,) the &s;ale of his &s;tock cleared 97l. 10s. I then endeavoured to get in what was owing to him, particularly that debt of Gray's: and I believe we have done the be&s;t. We have collected 43l. I have al&s;o &s;old the little tenement near Burnt-wood for 55l. Out of this money good Mr. Webb, whom you remember, and who has done all this bu&s;i|ne&s;s for us, charges only 5l. which I thought very little, as lawyer's work, I know, is co&s;tly. So that you &s;ee by this account, you are worth 180l. 10s. and &s;ome little intere&s;t which we are to receive at Michael|mas, for part of it, during the la&s;t two years, will bring the whole, as you will &s;ee, to near 200l. John then put the accounts into his nephew's hand; and told him, Mr. Webb de&s;ired, when he had examined
<PB N="21" REF="23">them, that he would &s;ign them. And now, &s;aid John, the next que&s;tion is, what is to be done with all this money?</P>
<P>Many young lads, thus made &s;uddenly rich, would have had a hundred &s;chemes at once. Young Meadows had but one. He was now thoroughly reformed; and as tho|roughly convinced of his uncle's care and kindne&s;s. He was a &s;en&s;ible lad; and clearly &s;aw, how kind a part his uncle had acted. He told him therefore how much obliged he was to him for &s;aving him, and his little fortune from de&s;truction; and if he would be &s;o good as advi&s;e him what to do, he would leave the management of every thing to him. Why then, &s;aid John, I think you are yet too young to know what to do with it your&s;elf. You had better put it out to u&s;e; and let it increa&s;e for a few years. In five or &s;ix it will increa&s;e 50l. and you will then be grown as many years wi&s;er; and may either turn it to farming; or what you like better. This advice was taken; and John got the money well put out by Mr. Webb's means. But before this was done, Tom Meadows, who was a generous-hearted young fellow, wi&s;hed to make &s;ome pre&s;ents to his cou&s;ins, in gratitude to his uncle for having &s;aved his little affairs from ruin. But John
<PB N="22" REF="24">would hear of nothing on that head; telling his nephew,
<Q><L>That none was in a way to give,</L>
<L>Who was not in a way to live.</L></Q></P>
<P>In about half a dozen years, a good, little farm in the neighbourhood offering; and Meadows &s;till continuing his love for hu&s;bandry-bu&s;ine&s;s, his uncle per&s;uaded him to take it; and a&s;&s;i&s;ted him with his advice in &s;tocking, and managing it. Young Mea|dows was &s;kilful, indu&s;trious, and careful. His &s;kill taught him what was be&s;t: his in|du&s;try performed what his &s;kill pointed out; and his care pre&s;erved, what his indu&s;try pro|cured. From &s;kill, indu&s;try, and care every thing may be expected. Every thing there|fore throve under &s;uch management; and the little farm produced more than many farms of double the rent. His uncle &s;oon advi&s;ed him to add to it, by taking more land; but at the &s;ame time told him, that a little farm well managed, was better than a large one neglected.</P>
<P>But here I mu&s;t mention an affair, which made a great change in his life. He had had from his earlie&s;t youth a great regard for a farmer's daughter in his father's neigh|bourhood. She too had ob&s;erved it, and had no di&s;like to him, (for he was a plea&s;ing, good natured fellow,) but &s;he
<PB N="23" REF="25">heard all her friends &s;peak of him, as &s;o bad, and idle in all his behaviour, that &s;he never allowed her&s;elf to think favourably of him. Afterwards, when &s;he heard from all hands how clever, and worthy a young fellow Tom Meadows was grown, it gave her great plea|&s;ure; tho &s;he did not know for what parti|cular rea&s;on. Of this young woman Tom Meadows began now to think, when he found him&s;elf in a condition to maintain a wife with credit: and he intru&s;ted his faith|ful uncle with his &s;ecret.</P>
<P>This was rather a little di&s;appointment to John, who &s;ecretly hoped, that young Meadows would perhaps have married one of his daughters. He would not however allow the thought to take a moment's po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of him; but immediately told his nephew, he had always heard Nancy Free|man mightily prai&s;ed. But as you have not &s;een her, &s;aid he, for &s;ome time, you may now think different when you do &s;ee her: or perhaps &s;he may be engaged. I would ad|vi&s;e you therefore to &s;ay nothing at pre&s;ent; but go, and vi&s;it your aunt Grace. There, &s;aid John, you will <HI>&s;ee how the land lies;</HI> and may act accordingly.</P>
<P>Young Meadows followed his uncle's ad|vice. He paid a vi&s;it to his aunt Grace; and finding <HI>the land lay very well,</HI> he mentioned his wi&s;hes fir&s;t to farmer Freeman; and then to his daughter. The farmer had no ob|jection:
<PB N="24" REF="26">and the young woman gave him no denial;&mdash;only &s;he wi&s;hed for a little time to con&s;ider about it. Tom however plainly &s;aw he had an intere&s;t in her affections. So a &s;econd vi&s;it to his aunt Grace brought mat|ters to a conclu&s;ion; and he came home with the happy tidings, that the 20th of the next month was fixed for the day.</P>
<P>But God almighty leads us to happine&s;s in his own way. The things of this world do not always happen according to our wi&s;hes, and expectations: and this &s;hould prevent our &s;etting our hearts upon them. It hap|pened &s;o on this occa&s;ion. While young Meadows was fitting up his farm-hou&s;e neatly for his bride, he received a letter by the po&s;t on friday, informing him, that &s;he had been &s;eized with a fever the &s;unday before, and was then lying &s;peechle&s;s. He immediately mounted his hor&s;e, and riding all night, got ju&s;t in time to receive an affectionate look, and farewell &s;mile, which &s;hot through his heart with a thou&s;and ten|der feelings, never afterwards forgotten. He &s;aw her at ten o'clock. At twelve &s;he was a corp&s;e.</P>
<P>This melancholy event gave a new turn to the mind of young Meadows. At fir&s;t all was horror, and confu&s;ion around him. His chearful fields, were &s;olitary wa&s;tes: the &s;un&s;hine of heaven was a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing gloom. The darkne&s;s of night was more
<PB N="25" REF="27">plea&s;ant to him, than the light of the &s;un. He thought not about his bu&s;ine&s;s; but walked among the lanes, and hedges, avoid|ing his very workmen; and afraid to &s;peak to any body he met. Even his uncle's family he &s;hunned.</P>
<P>By degrees however his mind became more calm. His temper, which was na|turally lively, in a few years recovered at times a little of it's chearfulne&s;s. His good-nature began to flow, as u&s;ual, to every body around him; and he could join in innocent amu&s;ements. The &s;ettled bent of his di&s;po&s;ition however became &s;erious, and religious. He often u&s;ed to make a compari&s;on between the wretched creature he once was, given up to drinking, and debauchery; and the &s;ober, innocent life he now led. And with regard to the great affliction he had met with, he could now even think of that with &s;atisfaction. He would &s;ay, tho it was bitter to him at the time, yet it had befallen him through a kind Providence. She was taken to God's mercy, he doubted not; and in&s;tead of the many di&s;tre&s;&s;es &s;he might have met with in this world, was changed into a happy being. While he him&s;elf, had &s;een in a thou&s;and in&s;tances of what advantage his afflictions had been to him. His wicked heart want|ed thoroughly to be &s;ubdued; and, nothing but &s;o great an affliction as this had been,
<PB N="26" REF="28">could have done it effectually. God al|mighty had now, he hoped, thoroughly wrought his conver&s;ion. He had long &s;een the folly of wickedne&s;s: he now &s;aw the hap|pine&s;s of religion.</P>
<P>With the&s;e thoughts the manner of his life agreed. He &s;eldom went from home. He employed his time on the bu&s;ine&s;s of his farm; and his lei&s;ure on reading the bible, and other good books. His family was an example to all farmers. He was kind to his &s;ervants, and workmen; and took care to have them well-in&s;tructed. In none of his fields an oath, or a lewd je&s;t was ever heard. As he was much among his labourers, he had a con&s;tant eye over them. Every &s;unday he carried them with him to church; and took care, that the lads went regularly to hear the catechi&s;m explained; which he thought was much fitter for them, than for mere children, who could under&s;tand but little of what they were told.</P>
<P>He never again had any thoughts of marriage. He had always two or three of the grand-children of his good uncle with him, whom he called his nephews, and nieces; and bad them call him uncle, a name he liked to hear. But, for &s;ome rea&s;on or other, little Nancy was his great favourite; and always lived with him. Nancy fed the poultry, and took care of the pet-lambs; and as &s;he grew up, had the
<PB N="27" REF="29">charge of the dairy. He always expre&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t regard for his uncle; and u&s;ed to &s;hew it to all his relations. His uncle, he would often &s;ay, was the great means, un|der God, of &s;aving him from de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Thus I have put together what particulars I could find of this worthy man. Many of them happened, after that part of John True|man's life, in which I have placed them, but I thought it was be&s;t to put them all down together.</P>
<P>Whether farmer Meadows is now alive, I know not. The la&s;t account I heard of him was from one of his neighbours, at Wey|hill-fair; who &s;aid, he was alive, and hearty; and one of the be&s;t men in England. I re|member that was the man's expre&s;&s;ion. But this is now at lea&s;t &s;even years ago; and if he be &s;till alive, he mu&s;t be advancing to|wards old-age. But it is time now to return to John Trueman.</P>
<P>In the year 1765, James Ivy&s;on died; who was out-door &s;teward, or bailiff to the Squire; and overlooked his workmen and cattle. Every body &s;aid, the Squire would appoint John Trueman in his room; becau&s;e they thought he was the fitte&s;t for it. But the Squire was then at his e&s;tate in Norfolk; and nobody knew any thing more for a fort|night; when a letter came by the po&s;t from the Squire to Mr. Trim, his honour's attor|ney,
<PB N="28" REF="30">de&s;iring him to get John Trueman to look after his affairs, till his return; when he &s;hould &s;atisfy him for his trouble. After the Squire came home, nothing more was &s;aid. The Squire however ordered the Wood-hou&s;e cottage to be fitted up very neatly, and fur|ni&s;hed. Then people began to change their minds, and think it was for the young man, whom the Squire had brought with him out of Norfolk; and who, it was &s;aid, was going to marry madam's maid. But Mr. Trim told farmer Weeks at the ve&s;try, that he &s;till believed John Trueman was the man; though the Squire, who commonly kept his thoughts to him&s;elf, had &s;aid nothing certain to him.</P>
<P>However &s;o it was: for when all was fini&s;hed at the cottage, in about two months, the Squire &s;ent for John Trueman into his library; and bidding him &s;it down, began by telling him, he had always had a very good opinion of him; which compliment John returned by telling the Squire, in the frank|ne&s;s of his heart, that he had always had the &s;ame of him. Well, &s;aid the Squire, I value your good opinion, John, more than that of many a man, who wears a better coat: but I did not &s;end for you now, that we &s;hould compliment one another; but to talk about bu&s;ine&s;s. I think, &s;aid he, my hone&s;t neighbour, you are now too old to work. I hope, Sir, &s;aid John, your ho|nour's tenant, farmer Weeks, did not tell
<PB N="29" REF="31">you &s;o: I have worked with him, off and on, the&s;e fifteen years; and I hope I can do a tolerabli&s;h day's work yet. No, no, &s;aid the Squire, Weeks did not tell it me; I &s;peak only from the pari&s;h-regi&s;ter: I &s;hould gue&s;s you are now about &s;ixty. Your honour gue&s;&s;es very well, &s;aid Trueman. La&s;t Whit&s;un-tue&s;day I entered into my &s;ixty-fir&s;t year. The Squire then a&s;ked John what he made of his work by the year; for he un|der&s;tood that he, and his &s;ons generally worked by the great? Plea&s;e your honour, &s;aid Trueman, I always made enough to live on: but I never kept any count. Well, &s;aid the Squire, to cut the matter &s;hort, you know &s;omething by this time of my bu&s;i|ne&s;s; and I know &s;omething of your abili|ties to manage it; have you any objection to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Wood-hou&s;e cottage, and &s;upply Ivy&s;on's room? I &s;hall allow you fifty pounds a year, and &s;ome other little per|qui&s;ites.&mdash;Objection! Sir, &s;aid Trueman, what objection can I have? But, I think, your honour ought to have objection thus to &s;addle your&s;elf with an old man, ju&s;t off his work.&mdash;Why you contradict your&s;elf, John, &s;aid the Squire &s;miling: you told me ju&s;t now, that farmer Weeks would tell me a different &s;tory. However, continued he, it is of no con&s;equence; for it is not the u&s;e of your hands that I want, but of your head. I do not want you to work your&s;elf;
<PB N="30" REF="32">but to &s;ee that other people work. As I have a great many labourers about me, I want a good eye over them: and if I am not mi&s;taken, you have both &s;pirit, and ho|ne&s;ty to do the fair thing by them, and me. &mdash;My wife al&s;o tells me, that nobody makes better butter, than Betty Trueman. She wi&s;hes therefore to place her over the dairy, and poultry. Some con&s;ideration al&s;o &s;hall be had for that. One of her daughters, I think, lives with her; &s;he may &s;till continue to do &s;o; and I will pay her wages, as your wife's &s;ervant. And as for your &s;ons, if you can employ them all about the grounds, I &s;hall be glad; for I am told, there are not better working lads in the pari&s;h.</P>
<P>Trueman felt more for all this goodne&s;s, than he could well utter. The Squire how|ever under&s;tood by his looks, what was in his heart. In &s;hort, it was agreed, before they parted, that John &s;hould take imme|diate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Wood-hou&s;e cottage; which was a neat, thatched, brick building, con&s;i&s;ting of four good rooms, and out|hou&s;es; &s;urrounded on three &s;ides by a large oak-wood, from which it had it's name, and open in front to a meadow, with a &s;tream at the bottom, and a fine view into the country beyond it.</P>
<P>On the evening after this conver&s;ation, John called &s;uch of his children together, as were at home, and told them all that had
<PB N="31" REF="33">pa&s;&s;ed&mdash;how kind God had been to him&mdash; and that, next to God, their be&s;t &s;ervices were due to the good Squire. I always had a &s;ecret tru&s;t, &s;aid John, that God, who is the poor labourer's true&s;t friend, would never for|&s;ake me in my old age; nor &s;uffer me to be a burthen to the pari&s;h.</P>
<P>John then told them, that though people commonly bequeathed their goods at their death, he cho&s;e to bequeath his in his life|time: for he had now, he &s;aid, no more oc|ca&s;ion for them. The good Squire had pro|vided for all his wants. He then produced his little &s;tock among them&mdash;his cow&mdash;his pigs&mdash;his poultry&mdash;and hou&s;ehold furniture. Every one was to chu&s;e in order; and the mother was to chu&s;e for the three daughters, who were out at &s;ervice. It happened how|ever, in this family di&s;tribution, that the younge&s;t came off the be&s;t; for the elde&s;t refu&s;ed to take the be&s;t things, le&s;t they &s;hould injure the younger. The cow was left to the la&s;t. Well, &s;ays John, &s;ince none of you will take the cow, if you are all wil|ling, we'll give her to Tom; for he is the only one among you, who is married, and has a family; and milk will be more u&s;eful there, than any where el&s;e. This propo&s;al plea&s;ed them all, but Tom; who would not accept the cow on any account. The di&s;|pute however was at la&s;t ended by giving her to Tom's elde&s;t &s;on, John, a little chuffy
<PB N="32" REF="34">boy, who was ju&s;t old enough to be taught to &s;ay "Tank you, granfar, for Cherry."</P>
<P>But the goods, which the old man prized mo&s;t, were not yet di&s;po&s;ed of. The&s;e were his tools. There was not a man in the pari&s;h, who had &s;o complete a &s;et of tools of every kind as John Trueman. He kept them all in the nice&s;t order; and u&s;ed to call them his hands; and would thank God for giving him &s;o many hands, that if one &s;hould be di&s;abled, he might u&s;e another. The only thing, in which John ever &s;hewed any backwardne&s;s in a&s;&s;i&s;ting a neighbour, was in lending him a tool. But he had often &s;uffered for his good-nature; and found no|body &s;o exact about tools as he was him|&s;elf; nor that &s;hewed the care for them, which he thought a good tool de&s;erved. The&s;e tools he di&s;tributed among his &s;ons&mdash; a &s;cythe, and a couple of bill-books to one&mdash; a couple of &s;pades, and a pickax to another; be&s;towing at the &s;ame time &s;ome commenda|tion on each tool; and telling his &s;ons, that the&s;e tools, under God, had been the &s;upport of them all&mdash;and that he who did not value his tool, &s;eldom cared much about his work.</P>
<P>John having thus di&s;po&s;ed of his goods, had nothing now left, but to &s;ettle his family. Tom, the &s;econd &s;on, who was married, was put into immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his father's old habitation. The elde&s;t, and younge&s;t, John propo&s;ed to take with him to the Wood|hou&s;e
<PB N="33" REF="35">cottage, as &s;oon as they could hand|&s;omely leave their ma&s;ter; for they both worked with the &s;ame farmer. Jenny, of cour&s;e, went with her mother.&mdash;Thus the&s;e pious parents found them&s;elves happily pro|vided for in their old age, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God; who never for&s;akes his religious &s;er|vants; but always in &s;ome way &s;upports them. John u&s;ed often to &s;ay, God was the poor man's only friend. The rich may take comfort, if they can find any, in their riches, and plea&s;ures; but the poor man, he would &s;ay, has nothing to depend on, but God. It is his bu&s;ine&s;s therefore certainly to make God his friend.</P>
<P>John having now &s;ettled his affairs, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his cottage, and new employ|ment: and that he might make the better appearance, he laid a&s;ide his old working jacket, and wore every day his be&s;t coat; which had &s;erved him nine years for a &s;un|day's coat; and had been every week carefully laid by in the che&s;t. He now bought a new one for &s;undays. His wi&s;e al&s;o laid a&s;ide her lin&s;ey gown; and, except when &s;he was about &s;ome dirty work, put on always her camblet one.</P>
<P>John lived in his new employment twenty two years; and the Squire was &s;o well plea&s;ed with him, that he was often heard to &s;ay, if he had had him ten years before, he &s;hould not only have had his work better done; but &s;hould have &s;aved many a pound:
<PB N="34" REF="36">for tho James Ivy&s;on was always reputed, and was in fact, a very hone&s;t man, yet he had not that &s;pirit, and commanding way with him, of keeping people to their work, which John had. And yet John was beloved by all the labourers; for he was always doing good turns to one, or another with the Squire; and plainly &s;hewed that he did not want to get all favour to him&s;elf. Indeed he was continually applying to the Squire, or his Lady, not only for the labourers; but for any of the pari&s;h, whom he thought pro|per objects. The Squire, and his Lady were the friends of the poor, and always ready to incourage his applications; well knowing both his hone&s;ty, and his judgment. John's rule was, to &s;peak to the Squire about the men; and to his Lady about the women, and children.</P>
<P>The Squire generally after breakfa&s;t, took a walk among his workmen; and after he and John had talked over the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of the day, John took that opportunity to introduce his other bu&s;ine&s;s. Poor Tim Jenkins, plea&s;e your honour, &s;aid John to him one day, has got into a &s;ad &s;crape. The poor lad works with farmer Sykes, and had been &s;ent by his ma&s;ter with a gun to terrify the rooks from the corn; when a hare popt out, and Tim, &s;illy lad, could not help &s;hooting at her, and unluckily killed her. Ju&s;t as he was taking her up, who &s;hould
<PB N="35" REF="37">come riding down the lane, but Sir Thomas's &s;teward. He took down Tim's name, and told him he &s;hould hear from Sir Thomas by and by; and the poor lad hears, that Mr. Trim has orders to proceed again&s;t him; &s;o I fear he will get into &s;ome mi&s;chief, (for Sir Thomas, your honour knows, is young and hot,) unle&s;s you will be plea&s;ed to write a bit of a note to pacify him: I know he will re|fu&s;e your honour nothing: and the poor lad is in a world of trouble for what he has done. He never was a poacher in all his life; and I dare be bound, he will never do &s;uch another thing again.&mdash;The Squire promi&s;ed to write a note that evening to Sir Thomas; and was going away, when John called his attention again. Sir, &s;aid he, I have another little matter to mention. Robin Napper bought ye&s;terday, at farmer Ayles's &s;ale, a &s;core of weathers; which he intends to fat: but as I think his lands are not yet ready for them, I advi&s;ed him, if your honour has no objection, to let them go a few weeks, in your honour's rough grounds about Mill|pond. I'll take care they &s;hall do no mi&s;|chief. To this al&s;o the Squire con&s;ented; and left John very happy in having got a pardon for poor Tim, and the rough grounds for his friend Robin.</P>
<P>The Lady he u&s;ed to take about the time, when &s;he went to &s;ee her poultry, which was generally about eleven o'clock. She
<PB N="36" REF="38">had &s;omething of humour about her, and u&s;ed to &s;ay, &s;he never &s;aw John look &s;illy, but when he had &s;ome reque&s;t to make. Whenever &s;he &s;aw him <HI>with that particular face on,</HI> as &s;he called it, &s;he knew at once what he intended to &s;ay; and without wait|ing for his reque&s;t, would a&s;k, Well, Mr. Trueman, what's gone wrong now? I heard her a&s;k him this que&s;tion one day, when John, making one of his &s;ideling bows, an&s;wered, No great matter gone wrong, Madam, but poor little Ro&s;e Smith, that fine little girl you took &s;o much notice of, when you went out of church the &s;unday before la&s;t, has burnt her leg very &s;adly; and old dame Pla&s;ket has done what &s;he can for her; but it grows wor&s;e. Poor Smith, I fear, can hardly rai&s;e money enough to pay a doctor; &s;o I thought, Madam, I would mention the thing to you, if you would let me &s;end Mr. Morley to her.&mdash;In all the&s;e reque&s;ts it was hard to &s;ay, whether the <HI>a&s;ker,</HI> the <HI>giver,</HI> or the <HI>receiver</HI> was more gratified.</P>
<P>As John was kind to all the labourers, he was equally attentive to the Squire's bu&s;ine&s;s. He kept the people to their work; but with|out any over-bearing temper: tho it was the more difficult, as he was now placed over many of his old companions. Nobody gave him more trouble, than one Willet, who was always at a loo&s;e end. Why now,
<PB N="37" REF="39">Dicky, John would &s;ay to him, &s;uppo&s;e the Squire &s;hould &s;nip you off a &s;hilling or two, from your wages on &s;aturday-night, would not you &s;ay he cheated you? And is it not ju&s;t the &s;ame, if you &s;nip him off an hour or two a day from his work; which you may ea&s;ily do by working as if you were not in earne&s;t? If the Squire's work be too hard for you, you had better go &s;omewhere el&s;e: but while you receive hone&s;t pay, do, my man, earn it hone&s;tly. &mdash; Willet &s;oon after took his advice, and went where he was not &s;o clo&s;ely looked after. Nobody was a better judge of work, than John. He put nothing hard upon the labourers. At the &s;ame time, none of the idle fellows cared much to work under him.</P>
<P>But idlene&s;s was not the only thing John u&s;ed to complain of among the workmen; he was often hurt with a little, dirty, mean, envious temper, which he found among them. If ever he did any of them a good turn with the Squire, he was &s;ure to hear, from one, or another, &s;omething bad of the per&s;on he had a&s;&s;i&s;ted; which was as much as to &s;ay, the informer thought he de&s;erved a favour better him&s;elf. Tho the truth &s;ome|times came out on the&s;e occa&s;ions; yet John was very backward in believing the reports of malice, and envy. He generally lent a deaf ear to them; and in&s;tead of li&s;tening, would turn another way; and bid one of the men mea&s;ure that ditch, whether it was &s;o wide
<PB N="38" REF="40">as it &s;hould be: or make that part of the drain a little deeper.</P>
<P>While John was, one day, directing &s;ome workmen near the great road, he was much affected by a circum&s;tance he met with. A cart came by, with a poor old man in it, who &s;eemed but ju&s;t alive. Pray, ma&s;ter, &s;aid the carter, be &s;o good as to tell me the way to your poor-hou&s;e. What have you got for us there, &s;aid John? A poor &s;trolling fellow, &s;aid the carter, who has been hopping about all the pari&s;hes of our county, with one leg; and being taken ill in ours, we had him examined, and find he belongs to you; and as we would not rob you of &s;uch pre|cious &s;tuff, we have brought him to you again.</P>
<P>While the fellow was making the&s;e low jokes, John thought he di&s;covered in the poor wretch &s;omething of the features of his old friend Andrew Wilkins, tho he had not now either &s;een, or heard of him, the&s;e fifteen years. He a&s;ked the carter his name; for the man him&s;elf &s;eemed &s;peechle&s;s. The fellow &s;aid he could not tell: but on looking into his order; His honour's name, &s;aid he, is An|drew Wilkins, knight of the beggars, if you know &s;uch a gentleman. John's heart was too full to an&s;wer the fellow's inhumanity as it de&s;erved. He told him he would take the charge of the poor man him&s;elf: but the carter &s;aying, he dur&s;t not &s;hove him out any
<PB N="39" REF="41">where, but as the order directed, John went with him to the poor-hou&s;e, where he &s;aw Andrew laid up comfortably: but he was too far gone to take any refre&s;hment; and died that night.</P>
<P>John did not fail, the next day, to give the young fellows, who had &s;een what had pa&s;&s;ed, a lecture on the &s;ubject. "That poor fel|low, &s;aid he, whom you &s;aw brought to the poor-hou&s;e ye&s;terday, was, formerly one of the clevere&s;t lads in this pari&s;h. I &s;uppo&s;e hardly any of you, except Jonathan, can re|member much of him. You remember, Jonathan, what a clever lad he was. A more &s;ober, quiet, hone&s;t, diligent fellow God never put breath into. He was the be&s;t thatcher in all the&s;e parts. Where I made one &s;hilling, he made two; and might have done as well as any man in the country. But the devil, and bad company put it into his head, to go to the ale-hou&s;e. One &s;up of beer drew on another; and that made him reli&s;h a third: and when <HI>he began to like it,</HI> all was over with him. So you &s;ee, my lads, it is not always beginning well, that keeps us right. A man may be ruined at any time of his life, without his own care, and the grace of God to follow it. Whatever you do, my lads, keep from the&s;e bad hou&s;es. It will never be well, till the green gra&s;s grows in the path-way to all the ale-hou&s;es, and pot|hou&s;es in the country."</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="42">John him&s;elf took great pains to carry his labourers <HI>another</HI> way. Of one thing he made a point, which was to have them all a&s;&s;emble, every &s;unday morning, and go with him to church; except &s;uch as had large fa|milies, who &s;tayed at home every other &s;un|day, that their wives might take their turns: and, generally every Ea&s;ter, they all appeared at the &s;acrament. In about a year, John had brought them into &s;uch regular habits, that it was plea&s;ing to &s;ee &s;o many people together &s;o orderly. The Squire had &s;eldom fewer, than thirty, or forty men at work. They were chiefly employed in draining, fencing, and improving a large tract of common, which had been taken in by act of Parlia|ment; and which the Squire was dividing into farms.</P>
<P>About the beginning of february, in the year 1787, John Trueman was taken ill of a &s;ort of pleuritic di&s;order, which it was thought he had brought on by expo&s;ing him|&s;elf too much to the cold ea&s;t winds. At fir&s;t his head ran continually on his bu&s;ine&s;s. He could get no &s;leep. He was &s;ure Wat Nixon would not &s;ink the drain deep enough: for there was a great &s;oak of water, he &s;aid, in that place, and a &s;hallow drain would &s;ig|nify nothing. But the Squire a&s;&s;ured him, he him&s;elf had &s;een the drain; and that it, and every thing el&s;e, were going on very well. The Squire then gave po&s;itive orders,
<PB N="41" REF="43">that nobody, on any account, &s;hould &s;peak a word to him about bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>By degrees the good, old man became compo&s;ed; and all worldly thoughts &s;ub&s;ided. No hope of his recovery remained. The evening before he died, the Squire &s;aw him for the la&s;t time. He took him by the hand, and a&s;ked him; How he felt him&s;elf? John &s;aid nothing; but gave him a look &s;o full of tenderne&s;s, affection, and heavenly feeling, that I heard the Squire &s;ay, he would freely give a hundred guineas to have that look ex|actly taken down in a picture&mdash;<HI>It &s;et all the world at a di&s;tance.</HI> I remember that was the Squire's expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The &s;ame evening John &s;aw al&s;o, for the la&s;t time, his children, and grand-children; and ble&s;&s;ing them all &s;ent them to their re&s;t. His wife alone, who would not leave him, &s;at by him in &s;ilent &s;orrow; and between eleven, and twelve, he went off in a quiet, compo&s;ed &s;leep, with his hand locked in hers. He died in the eighty-&s;econd or eighty-third year of his age, equally regretted by the Squire&mdash;the whole body of workmen&mdash;and all who knew him. He was carried to his grave by &s;ix of his grand-children, each about &s;eventeen or eighteen years of age. "Well, younkers, (&s;aid the clergyman to them, at the grave-&s;ide, after the &s;ervice was over,) you have now followed your good old grand-father to his grave. I hope you will all en|deavour
<PB N="42" REF="44">to follow him a little farther. He was a good chri&s;tian, and an example to us all." The poor lads wiped their gli&s;tening eyes with their coat-&s;leeves, and black gloves; and &s;aid nothing: but their hearts glowed within them; and each thought he would do his be&s;t to be like his grand-father.</P>
<P>The old man was buried on the north &s;ide of the church, near the yew-tree; and the Squire placed a hand&s;ome &s;tone over his grave, with an in&s;cription to his memory.</P>
<P>His wife died about &s;ix months after, equally beloved, and regretted; and was bu|ried by his &s;ide.</P>
<P>After the death of John Trueman, the Squire appointed his elde&s;t &s;on James to &s;uc|ceed him; who having had a better educa|tion, than his father; and having been brought more into the world, became a man of more con&s;equence: and was very lately, on the death of Mr. Woodcock, appointed the Squire's principal manager of all his e&s;tates, both in Hamp&s;hire, and in Norfolk, with a &s;alary, for living, and travelling charges, of two hundred a year, and a good hou&s;e to live in. Having been more among gentlemen he &s;oon got their manners; and always &s;at at the Squire's table; except when he had any lords, or other great company with him. Yet he &s;till pre&s;erved his father's &s;implicity of behaviour, changing only his hone&s;t bluntne&s;s into a little more civility,
<PB N="43" REF="45">and politene&s;s.&mdash;But as Mr. James True|man is &s;till alive, I fear to &s;ay any thing, which, if the&s;e papers &s;hould get into his hands, might offend his mode&s;ty.</P>

<HEAD>THE LIFE OF RICHARD ATKINS.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE I begin the life of Richard Atkins, I mu&s;t beg the reader's pardon for a little impo&s;ition I put upon him, with regard to his name. In the fir&s;t edition of this work, I called him Richard Worthle&s;s. But many people, who had been in tho&s;e parts, &s;aid they knew no &s;uch per&s;on; and began to doubt the truth of the whole &s;tory. I am thus obliged therefore to put down his real name, which was Richard Atkins. In|deed I was unwilling to put it down at fir&s;t, becau&s;e there are two or three in this pari&s;h, and perhaps more in other pari&s;hes, of the name of Atkins, who are very good people; and I was afraid of giving them offence. I know few better men any where, than Ed|ward Atkins of Lea&s;ide; and I never heard any thing bad of Jonathan at the mill; ex|cept the &s;tory, that farmer Hollis u&s;ed to
<PB N="48" REF="50">tell; which nobody believed, as he had a quar|rel with the miller.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t al&s;o de&s;ire the reader will excu&s;e my calling him the &s;on of a <HI>&s;hoemaker;</HI> where|as in fact, his father was a <HI>tailor.</HI> But I did this, (for the &s;ame rea&s;on, as I changed his name,) the better to conceal him; le&s;t I &s;hould give offence.</P>
<P>But now le&s;t the reader &s;hould think I have impo&s;ed upon him in other things, as well as in the&s;e, I de&s;ired the church-wardens, and over&s;eers to certify the truth of the fol|lowing account, to which they had no ob|jection. I have therefore put down their cer|tificate.</P>
<P><HI>WE, who&s;e names are hereunto &s;ub&s;cribed, having read the following account of Richard Atkins, &s;on of tailor Atkins; and having known the &s;aid Richard Atkins from a boy, do hereby certify and declare, that we do be|lieve the &s;aid account to be a true, and faith|ful one; as witne&s;s our hands,</HI>

<P><PB N="49" REF="51">RICHARD ATKINS was the &s;on of a drunken tailor, who might have had all the bu&s;ine&s;s of the pari&s;h; if he had not loved the ale-hou&s;e better than his work.</P>
<P>The man, who neglects his bu&s;ine&s;s, will al&s;o neglect his family. Young Atkins there|fore was left to pick up all the vices, he could find: and as he was an apt &s;cholar, he made a quick progre&s;s. He learned to &s;wear about the time he learned to &s;peak. Even his father thought he began to &s;wear too early; and has been heard to &s;ay, "D&mdash;n you, Dick, if I hear you &s;wear again, I'll lay this &s;tick over your &s;houlders." But the vice, to which he was mo&s;t addicted in his child-hood, was lying. Nobody could believe a word he &s;aid: and he &s;oon lo&s;t the name of Dick Atkins; and was known in the pari&s;h by the name of <HI>lying Dick.</HI>&mdash;But I &s;hall give &s;uch particulars of his life in order, as I have been able to collect; that I may &s;et him up as an example for others to avoid.</P>
<P>As far as I can find, he was at fir&s;t in|tended for his father's bu&s;ine&s;s: but the fa|ther's drunkenne&s;s &s;oon brought the bu&s;i|ne&s;s &s;o low, that it could not furni&s;h em|ployment either for the one, or the other. This, it mu&s;t be owned, was a great mi&s;|fortune to the lad; and not of his own bring|ing on: but a &s;ober, &s;teady youth would
<PB N="50" REF="52">have met with friends, who, in &s;uch circum|&s;tances would have relieved, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted him. Lying Dick never de&s;erved a friend. From the fir&s;t he &s;hewed a bad di&s;po&s;ition. Good boys remember the rule they have been taught; and never to do to others, what they would not like to have done to them&s;elves: but bad boys find a plea&s;ure in doing mi&s;|chief. Dick Atkins was never better plea&s;ed, than when he could play a mi&s;chievous trick. He liked to throw filth privately on the cloaths of pa&s;&s;engers&mdash;to &s;hew cruelty to birds, and beetles&mdash;to tie ears of corn to|gether in a path-way through a field, to trip people up in the dark&mdash;or to knock down a young duck, or a chicken.&mdash;But he once &s;everely paid for a piece of mi&s;chief of this kind. He met, one day, on the road, a blind beggar led by a dog; and cutting the &s;tring, had great plea&s;ure in &s;eeing the poor blind man grope about, on the lo&s;s of his faithful companion. This was &s;een at a little di&s;tance by an hone&s;t farmer on hor&s;eback, who appeared to take no no|tice, till he came to the &s;pot; when &s;uddenly jumping off his hor&s;e, he &s;eized poor Dick by the collar, and gave him &s;uch a hor&s;e|whipping, as he did not forget for &s;ome months after. He then made him kneel down in the dirt, and a&s;k the beggar's par|don; and then pull off his own garters, and tie the dog up again.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="53">But God Almighty, who is kind even to the unthankful, and unworthy, and throws opportunities of doing well in their way, if they would u&s;e them, threw opportunities in the way of this wicked youth.</P>
<P>He was about fifteen years of age, when his father died. His mother, and two daugh|ters were carried by the pari&s;h-officers to the poor-hou&s;e: but a good lady in the place, hearing that Dick, tho an idle vagabond, was old enough to get his bread; and wi&s;hing out of mere compa&s;&s;ion to put him into a way of doing well, if he cho&s;e it, &s;ent for him; and having cloathed him, placed him under her gardener. Here he might have done very well; and recovered all he had lo&s;t: but his mind ran on nothing but wickedne&s;s. The gardener however being a rough man, kept him in &s;ome kind of order by the help of a hazel wand: but he &s;carce ever dur&s;t tru&s;t him out of his &s;ight; or &s;et him about any thing, that required the lea&s;t care. Dick generally did as much mi&s;chief, as he did good; and nothing could have kept him &s;o long in his place, but the great de&s;ire his good mi&s;tre&s;s had to reclaim him. Many a time &s;he &s;ent for him into the parlour, on complaints from the gardener. Sometimes &s;he would threaten him,&mdash;&s;ometimes &s;he would give him kind admonitions&mdash;and &s;ome|times when he had done any thing, that had the lea&s;t appearance of care, and goodne&s;s, &s;he
<PB N="52" REF="54">would give him &s;ix-pence, or a &s;hilling, to encourage him. But all was to no purpo&s;e; his mind was bent on nothing, but wicked|ne&s;s. After keeping him therefore three years; and forgiving him almo&s;t as many faults, as he had &s;pent days in the hou&s;e, &s;he was obliged to &s;end him off at la&s;t, on his pilfering grapes through &s;ome panes of gla&s;s, which he had broken in the hot-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>As the manner, in which he was found out, may be a good caution to all thievi&s;h lads, I &s;hall relate it. It had long been his practice to pilfer fruits of different kinds, and &s;ell them at the next market by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Tom Flinch, who had been bound a pari&s;h apprentice to a neighbouring gar|dener. Flinch always &s;old them as his ma&s;|ter's; &s;o the theft pa&s;&s;ed off very well. But after they began to deal in hot-hou&s;e grapes, Flinch found him&s;elf &s;u&s;pected, as it was thought his ma&s;ter's hot-hou&s;e could not pro|duce any &s;o fine. He re&s;olved therefore in time to drop the trade. He had a quarrel al&s;o with Dick, who &s;wore he had cheated him: and the thing was true enough; for tho they had agreed to &s;hare the profits of their plunder equally together, Flinch, who was the older, and more cunning knave, never gave him more than two-pence in the &s;hilling. Flinch however had too much &s;pi|rit to be called a cheat by a thievi&s;h lad, and determined to be revenged. So he wrote
<PB N="53" REF="55">the gardener a &s;crawling letter, without a name, telling him how he might catch the thief, who had &s;tolen his grapes. If he would knock gently three times, on wedne&s;day evening at nine o'clock, at the little trap|door, through which bark u&s;ed to be thrown in, the door would open, and a hand with grapes would come out. The gardener did as he was in&s;tructed. He knocked three times gently at the trap-door; when it flew open; and a hand pu&s;hed out, with a large bunch of grapes; accompanied with a low voice, Is all &s;afe? The gardener in&s;tantly &s;eizing the hand, cryed out with a voice like thunder, Yes, all's &s;afe now. He then took a cord out of his pocket, which he had pro|vided for the purpo&s;e; and tying the hand tight to a &s;taple in the wall, he went round to di&s;cover the owner of it.</P>
<P>And now, while the gardener is going round, let me take the opportunity of giving young people, who find them&s;elves di&s;hone&s;t|ly inclined, a little advice. In the fir&s;t place, I would advi&s;e them to think better of it, and be hone&s;t: for thieving is a very dan|gerous trade; and is generally &s;ooner or later found out. But if they will not take this part of my advice, and are determined to continue to thieve, let me next advi&s;e them to be very cautious, whom they take in as partners of their trade: for this partner mu&s;t at any rate be a knave; and a knave is a
<PB N="54" REF="56">fellow, on whom they can have no &s;ecuri|ty. I dare &s;ay this is good advice, becau&s;e the&s;e were the very reflections, which poor Dick made, as he &s;tood in wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ul plight, with his arm &s;tretched through the hole, and pinned to the wall, expecting every moment the gardener's coming round. He wi&s;hed, in the fir&s;t place, he had never touched the grapes; and in the &s;econd, that he had never tru&s;ted &s;uch a wicked ra&s;cal as Tom Flinch.</P>
<P>Poor Dick had ju&s;t time to make the&s;e reflections, when he heard the gardener's foot coming bri&s;kly up the gravel-walk: The gardener knew well enough, what fox he had caught: but pretending, in the dark, not to know, he took the advantage of a bundle of hazel wands, which were &s;tand|ing again&s;t the wall for tying up flowers; and &s;hivered &s;everal of them in pieces upon the different parts of Dick's body, as he writhed, and twi&s;ted every part towards him; crying out, at every blow, Who are you, you thief? Who are you? &s;peak; you dog, &s;peak: I'll make you &s;peak: Dick &s;creamed loud enough to be heard half a mile off: but the gardener &s;till con|tinued laying on; and crying out, Speak, you dog, &s;peak: I'll make you &s;peak. Turn the other &s;ide, you ra&s;cal, you'll twi&s;t your arm off. In &s;hort he gave Dick a mo&s;t &s;evere beating; and did it on this
<PB N="55" REF="57">principle, that as he knew his good mi&s;|tre&s;s's lenity, he was de&s;irous of execu|tion fir&s;t, and of &s;entence afterwards. He was not however &s;atisfied with what he had done; but begged his mi&s;tre&s;s to let him carry Dick before the ju&s;tice. There will be no living, madam, &s;aid he, if &s;uch var|min is not properly <HI>catechized</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I &s;uppo&s;e the gardener meant <HI>cha&s;tized,</HI> for <HI>catechizing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> varmin</HI> will not always do.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>His mi&s;tre&s;s however did not care to car|ry him before a ju&s;tice; in which I think &s;he was wrong: for a &s;econd puni&s;hment would have done him no hurt; and might have tended perhaps to give his thieving hands another direction. However &s;he de&s;paired now of doing him any good, and turned him out of her &s;ervice.</P>
<P>As the reader is made a little acquainted with Tom Flinch, he may be curious per|haps to know what became of him. His hi&s;tory is very &s;hort: tho it was not con|cluded till two years after this time.</P>
<P>Dick, in hopes of appea&s;ing the gar|dener, while he was belabouring him, gave up his friend Flinch, as the beginner of all his wickedne&s;s. This, by the way, was a great lie; for at the fair (where ge|nerally there is as much bad, as good car|ried on) Dick fir&s;t met Flinch; and in|ticed him to join with him in robbing his
<PB N="56" REF="58">mi&s;tre&s;s's garden, and &s;elling the fruit. Before this, as far as I can find, Flinch was an hone&s;t lad. The gardener however took no notice of Dick's confe&s;&s;ion; but went on with the work of correction. Some days after, however, meeting Flinch in the road; Hark you, my lad, &s;aid he, come here. Flinch came trembling. The gardener then taking him a&s;ide, told him what Dick had &s;aid. Now tho I partly believe from &s;ome circum&s;tances, added the gardener, that the thing may be true: yet, as I never could believe a word that lying ra&s;cal &s;aid, I hope it may be fal&s;e. How|ever, whether it be true, or fal&s;e, I &s;hall take no farther notice, nor bring you into any trouble.&mdash;So take care, and be an hone&s;t lad.&mdash;This advice, or rather the fright he had received, had &s;uch an effect on Flinch, that he kept hone&s;t for three months.</P>
<P>The itch of thieving however came upon him again; and he began by half-pennies, and pennies to cheat his ma&s;ter in fruit; which he &s;old to &s;ervants, and others, who, he knew, would buy it without a&s;king que&s;tions. This is a very &s;hameful, and wicked practice; for &s;uch people not only join in the cheat, by purcha&s;ing at an under|price, what they know mu&s;t therefore be &s;tolen; but they encourage, and bring up thieves. This was the ca&s;e at pre&s;ent.
<PB N="57" REF="59">Incouraged by &s;uch people Flinch went on. At length however he began to be &s;u&s;|pected; and his ma&s;ter marking &s;ome fruit, and finding it gone, had little doubt what hands had taken it. He made in|quiry privately at market, and at the hou&s;es of his cu&s;tomers; and found, that Flinch had often &s;old fruit, on tho&s;e days, when he knew he had &s;ent him out only with garden-&s;tuff. Nothing more remained, but to endeavour to catch him in the fact, without &s;eeming to &s;u&s;pect him. Ac|cordingly one day, as Flinch was going to market with a ba&s;ket of peas, his ma&s;ter called him back: Hark you, Tom, &s;aid he, have I not often forbid you to carry the ba&s;ket &s;o full? You &s;catter half of them by the road; and people &s;ay there is not good mea&s;ure. Take a larger ba&s;ket. Fetch that, which &s;tands in the entry. Tom, after many &s;huffles, was obliged to fetch it; and his ma&s;ter turning the peas into it, behold! from the bottom came tumbling out grapes, peaches, and plumbs. Flinch, in great terror, was beginning to frame a lie, when his ma&s;ter &s;eizing him by the collar, gave him a terrible &s;hake, and &s;tifled the lie in his throat. You ra&s;|cal, &s;aid he, this trade has been carrying on the&s;e &s;everal months. I have long &s;u&s;|pected you: and now I have caught you.
<PB N="58" REF="60">Flinch was then given into the cu&s;tody of a con&s;table&mdash;committed to bridewell&mdash;car|ried before a bench of ju&s;tices&mdash;and &s;en|tenced to be whipt through the town: which &s;entence his ma&s;ter took care to have executed with &s;ufficient &s;everity.&mdash;This cha&s;ti&s;ement made Flinch an hone&s;t lad&mdash; that is, it made his hands hone&s;t: but in his heart he was as great a knave as ever. He went back to his place; but his ma&s;ter had now taken &s;uch a thorough di&s;like to him, that he was determined, if po&s;&s;ible, to get rid of him. While he was taking mea&s;ures for this purpo&s;e with the pari&s;h|officers, Flinch, who liked his ma&s;ter as little, as his ma&s;ter liked him, re&s;olved to &s;ave all farther trouble on this head, and to run off. What ha&s;tened this determination, was the jibing he continually met with from the lads in the town, when he went with his ba&s;ket. One would a&s;k him, If he had time to count the la&s;hes, while Smith was whipping him? Another would a&s;k, If his back was got well yet? and a third would tell him, he might be a&s;hamed of rearing &s;o loud for a few &s;cratches.</P>
<P>Flinch therefore being determined to leave his ma&s;ter, made up a little bundle of his things privately; and taking the day before him, went off early on monday morning, before his ma&s;ter was &s;tirring.
<PB N="59" REF="61">He needed not to have been at &s;o much pains to go off privately; for his ma&s;ter never thought him worth inquiring after.</P>
<P>Flinch took the road into Somer&s;et&s;hire. Here he found the people ju&s;t beginning harve&s;t; and offering him&s;elf to a farmer, as the weather was catching, he got work. After the harve&s;t was over, he &s;till con|tinued with his ma&s;ter, in the room of a &s;ick lad. As his character was not known in this part of the country, he might now have done very well. He had another op|portunity. God often gives wicked people opportunities to repent; but they chu&s;e ra|ther to li&s;ten to the devil. It happened &s;o on this occa&s;ion. Flinch had not been here long, before the devil put wicked thoughts into his head: and in&s;tead of driving them out, his own bad inclinations joined with them, and he forgot all the good re&s;olu|tions he made after his whipping; and the opportunity, which God had now given him of living again with credit.&mdash;But I will not &s;top the &s;tory of Dick Atkins by telling all the wicked tricks of Flinch&mdash; how he cheated one of his fellow &s;ervants of half a crown&mdash;how he &s;tole &s;ome linen from farmer Rogers's wife&mdash;and how he picked up a &s;ilver-&s;poon at Mr. Boothby's, where he had gone upon an errand. I &s;hall ju&s;t mention the thing, which brought him at la&s;t to the gallows. He had not yet
<PB N="60" REF="62">been found out, &s;o like all other &s;inners, he went from bad to wor&s;e.</P>
<P>Flinch, it &s;eems, had learned to write; which is a very good thing to tho&s;e, who make a right u&s;e of it: but ill-di&s;po&s;ed lads turn every thing to bad. If they learn to read; they read only bad books: if they learn to write, it makes them only more mi&s;chievous. Good lads make u&s;e of writing to inquire after their friends; and let them know, they are doing well them|&s;elves. But Flinch made a different u&s;e of his writing. The devil put it into his head to write a threatening letter to farmer Rogers, without a name, to get five guineas from him. The letter was as follows; as I copied it out of a new&s;paper, where it was put down.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>farmr Rodgrs</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>this is gif you notis that If you dont pit fiv ginnes Under the blu &s;ton At the ten mil &s;ton your A ded man &s;o luk tut From yurs to coman</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Flinch perhaps did not know, that writ|ing a threatening letter without a name, is a hanging-matter; which in fact it is, if it can be proved. He knew however, he intended to rob farmer Rogers of five guineas; and that he de&s;erved to be hanged for that.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="63">Farmer Rogers, who was a timorous man, was much terrified with this letter, and determined not to &s;tir abroad on any account. But the next day, the exci&s;eman calling upon him, Rogers &s;hewed him the letter. Poh! &s;aid the exci&s;eman, it is only the trick of &s;ome cowardly ra&s;cal&mdash; never trouble your head with it. Let us try however, if we can catch him. Leave the matter to me. So Mr. Jack&s;on took Tom Rogers with him, the farmer's elde&s;t &s;on; and together they contrived a box, in which they fixed the lock of a gun; tying to the trigger a pur&s;e with a few half-pence in it. They then filled the box with gun|powder; and put all together carefully un|der the blue &s;tone, as the letter directed. They then went to a hou&s;e at a di&s;tance, which overlooked the blue &s;tone; and re|lieving each other by turns, they waited for the explo&s;ion. The fir&s;t night nothing happened: but the &s;econd night, about twelve o'clock, they &s;aw, and heard the explo&s;ion. They immediately ran out; and found the poor mi&s;erable Flinch on the &s;pot in a mo&s;t deplorable condition. His face was all over black, and bloody&mdash;he was quite blind&mdash;and his right hand all &s;carified. The next day he was examined before a ju&s;tice, and &s;ent to Exeter jail; for the fact was committed ju&s;t within the borders of Devon&s;hire. At the next a&s;|&s;izes,
<PB N="62" REF="64">he was tried. The felony being plainly proved, he was found guilty, con|demned, and executed on that day three weeks. The jail-&s;urgeon &s;aid, he believed he could never have got his eyes again, if he had lived fifty years. The night before he was executed, he confe&s;&s;ed all his wick|edne&s;s to the clergyman, who attended the pri&s;oners&mdash;the linen he had &s;tolen&mdash;the half-crown&mdash;the &s;ilver-&s;poon; and &s;everal other things: but he &s;aid, the fir&s;t per&s;on that put any wickedne&s;s into his head, was a gardener's lad, whom he had been for|merly acquainted with, who&s;e name was Dick Atkins.</P>
<P>One thing I had almo&s;t forgotten to mention. When Flinch went fir&s;t into Somerfet&s;hire, he changed his name. I have heard what name he went by; but as I am not quite &s;ure, I forbear to mention it, as I &s;hould be very &s;orry to &s;ay any thing that was not quite true. Indeed I only mention the thing at all, le&s;t &s;ome, or other looking into the jail-books at Ex|eter, and not finding the name of Thomas Flinch, hanged at &s;uch a time, might &s;u&s;|pect the whole &s;tory to be an untruth. But Flinch was certainly hanged at Exeter; tho he was hanged by a different name.</P>
<P>Having di&s;patched Flinch, let us now look after his friend Dick Atkins; whom
<PB N="63" REF="65">we left ju&s;t turned out of the &s;ervice of his good old mi&s;tre&s;s, for &s;tealing grapes.</P>
<P>Dick had now the world to begin again. His good mi&s;tre&s;s had given him five &s;hil|lings to &s;ubli&s;t on, till he could get into work; with which Dick contrived to get five times drunk. She had given him al&s;o a &s;pade, and a mattock. The&s;e he pawned to repeat his favourite plea&s;ure a &s;ixth time.</P>
<P>Being now reduced to nece&s;&s;ity, he was obliged to take up his own tools, at the ex|pence of paying a penny a day out of his earnings, for the u&s;e of them, and work for the farmers. Nobody could work bet|ter, when he plea&s;ed: but Dick had no call, but mere nece&s;&s;ity. Few therefore cared to employ &s;o idle a fellow, when they could help it.</P>
<P>In the mean time his vices, which in|crea&s;ed with his years, began to make larger demands upon him. He had learned early to &s;wear, to pilfer, and to drink; but he had now attained his twentieth year; and &s;ought after other plea&s;ures. He be|gan to frequent bad hou&s;es&mdash;to get ac|quainted with abandoned women&mdash;to at|tend cock-fights&mdash;and to gamble at fairs, and hor&s;e-races. The&s;e were expen&s;ive plea&s;ures; and made a larger demand upon him, than his labour could furni&s;h. In his child hood he had been called <HI>lying
<PB N="64" REF="66">Dick;</HI> becau&s;e lying was the mo&s;t con&s;pi|cuous part of his character. But now he might have been called drunken Dick&mdash;or lewd Dick&mdash;or thieving Dick&mdash;or any other wicked name, that could be thought of.</P>
<P>Among the places, which this abandoned youth chiefly frequented, was a notorious pot-hou&s;e on the edge of a common. The woman who kept it was a vile pro&s;titute. This hou&s;e was frequented by all the thieves, cock-fighters, poachers, hor&s;e-racers, pick|pockets, and &s;mugglers, in the country: and tho Dick learned few new vices among them; yet he learned to practi&s;e his old ones in a more &s;hamele&s;s, and open man|ner. Something new however he was &s;till learning. He learned &s;everal new and more horrid oaths, than he had known be|fore: he learned &s;everal &s;hifts, and tricks, to &s;creen him&s;elf; and draw in the un|wary: he learned al&s;o the art, and my&s;|tery of &s;muggling, and of night-poaching, neither of which he had yet practi&s;ed.</P>
<P>Among the wicked wretches who fre|quented this hou&s;e, one of the mo&s;t wicked, was blear-eyed Ned, the &s;muggler. This fellow, as the mo&s;t wicked, was of cour&s;e the mo&s;t agreeable to Dick. They formed a great intimacy together; and were &s;carce ever &s;eparate. Among other pieces of in|&s;truction, which Dick received from this fellow, one was, that it was always better
<PB N="65" REF="67">to have the appearance of &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s; than to have none at all&mdash;that he him&s;elf had been bred a &s;awyer; that he &s;eldom in|deed worked at his bu&s;ine&s;s; but that he was always the le&s;s &s;u&s;pected from having one.</P>
<P>This advice to undertake a bu&s;ine&s;s, which required no work, was very agree|able to Dick. So he became a &s;awyer, and joined in partner&s;hip with blear-eyed Ned.</P>
<P>Of all bu&s;ine&s;&s;es, that of a &s;awyer is be&s;t &s;uited to an idle fellow: for tho a &s;awyer may make a great deal of money, if he be indu&s;trious, as many do; yet no bu&s;ine&s;s furni&s;hes &s;o many notable excu&s;es for idle|ne&s;s. The partner may be ill; or he may be out of the way: for as the &s;awyers work in partner&s;hip, there are the excu&s;es of two men, in&s;tead of one, to avail them&s;elves of, The &s;aw too may be out of order, which is an in&s;trument, that is not &s;o ea&s;ily re|paired.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the occupation of a &s;awyer, Dick had others. He broke hor&s;es for gentle|men; which furni&s;hed him with an oppor|tunity of riding about the country; and calling where he knew there was the be&s;t beer. He &s;muggled al&s;o a little with his friend blear-eyed Ned. But poaching was the bu&s;ine&s;s he took mo&s;t delight in. He knew well how to catch game of every kind.
<PB N="66" REF="68">As this was a bu&s;ine&s;s he liked, he made a great proficiency in it. No man knew better how to lay &s;nares for the hare, or the woodcock; or to take at once a whole covey of partridges, or phea&s;ants, as they crept through a hole in the hedge. He dealt a little in veni&s;on al&s;o. William&s;on, the mo&s;t noted deer-&s;tealer in the fore&s;t, u&s;ed to &s;ay, There was not a better fellow for the purpo&s;e in the whole country, than Dick Atkins, if he would give his mind to it. In fact <HI>he did give his mind to it;</HI> but hav|ing once nearly been &s;ent to jail for deer|&s;tealing, he was rather &s;hy of the bu&s;ine&s;s, and thought poaching a &s;afer employment.</P>
<P>In the&s;e occupations Dick made no di&s;|tinction of days: only that in general he &s;pent his &s;undays either at the pot-hou&s;e, or the ale-hou&s;e&mdash;commonly at the former; for there he met &s;ome or other of his vile companions: and as the pot-hou&s;e was more out of the way, they could drink, and roar, and play at nine-pins, and &s;wear, and cur&s;e, and wager, and bla&s;pheme, with le&s;s ob&s;ervation. As to the church, neither his father, nor his mother ever &s;et him an ex|ample of going there; and he had now &s;o long neglected it, that he might &s;ay, as another wicked drinking fellow once &s;aid, <HI>he had almo&s;t forgotten what the in&s;ide of a church was made of.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="69">Having thus taken a view of Dick Atkins as a &s;ingle man, let us next &s;ee him in a married &s;tate.</P>
<P>At a farm-hou&s;e in the pari&s;h, to which Atkins belonged, lived a young woman, of the name of Molly Somers. She was the only child of an hone&s;t farmer; and her parents dying young, &s;he had been very properly brought up by her uncle John, a very worthy man, who took her father's little farm on his death. By the care, and kindne&s;s of this relation, her &s;mall for|tune, which was about &s;eventy pounds, was increa&s;ed, when &s;he came of age, to near a hundred. He charged her nothing for her board, and cloathed her be&s;ides, on condition of her being u&s;eful in the family: and as Molly was a well-di&s;po&s;ed girl, they lived together in this way very happily; and both her uncle and aunt were as fond of her, as they were of their own children.</P>
<P>On this girl, or rather on her fortune; Dick Atkins had fixed his eyes. It was &s;ome time before &s;he took the lea&s;t notice of him. However by degrees it was whi&s;|pered about the pari&s;h, that Dick Atkins kept company with Molly Somers; and the thing came to her uncle's ears.</P>
<P>Why, Molly, &s;aid he, it &s;urely cannot be true, that you have any thoughts of marrying Dick Atkins?&mdash;Molly &s;aid no|thing.&mdash;You
<PB N="68" REF="70">mu&s;t certainly, Molly, con|tinued her uncle, do as you plea&s;e: I can lay no re&s;traint upon you: I only warn you, that if you do marry him, you are a ruined woman. Such another idle ra&s;cal does not live in this, or in the next pari&s;h to it. What hope can you have of a fel|low, who follows no bu&s;ine&s;s; and is drunk almo&s;t every day of his life? I have &s;een many of the&s;e idle ra&s;cals in my time; and I never &s;aw one of them, that ever came to good.</P>
<P>In the morning Molly told her uncle &s;he had been thinking of what he had &s;aid; and would take his advice. Accordingly the next time &s;he &s;aw Dick, &s;he told him &s;he had heard he was a drinking fellow; and as &s;he did not like drinking fellows, he need trouble his head no more about her.</P>
<P>Ah! Molly, &s;aid Dick, I &s;uppo&s;e un|cle John has been telling you all the&s;e fine &s;tories of me. But has not you the &s;en&s;e to &s;ee the rights ont? You are very u&s;eful to uncle; and he would be very &s;orry to lo&s;e you. And be&s;ides he would not wi&s;h you to marry, becau&s;e he hopes your fortune will go to his children.</P>
<P>This &s;truck poor Molly with the ir|re&s;i&s;tible force of truth. She knew well
<PB N="69" REF="71">that part of what Dick had &s;aid, was true; and &s;he concluded that all the re&s;t was true al&s;o. She now &s;aw clearly, that it was not in pure friend&s;hip, that her uncle had given her &s;o much good advice; and from this moment &s;he looked upon him as le&s;s &s;incere than he pretended. Of cour&s;e Dick's intere&s;t prevailed, as the uncle's le&s;&s;ened; and the affair went on as bri&s;kly as ever.</P>
<P>Well, Molly, &s;aid her uncle to her, &s;ince I cannot prevail on you in one thing, let me prevail on you in another. Let me intreat you not to marry, till your money is &s;ettled upon your&s;elf, and at your own di&s;po&s;al; &s;o that if the wor&s;t comes, you may at lea&s;t have &s;omething to depend on.</P>
<P>Molly thought this advice extremely good; and promi&s;ed to take it. The next day therefore &s;he mentioned to Dick. Ah! Molly, &s;aid Dick, this is another fetch of uncle's to &s;top our marriage. He knows well enough I cannot marry without money. I never wi&s;hes to deceive nobody: and I'll tell you, Molly, all the rights. I has been wild formerly&mdash;the wor&s;e luck. But &s;ince I got acquainted with you, nobody never &s;eed me in liquor; no nor never &s;hall. It is true, I has no money; but I can work as well as any body in the pari&s;h. What I wi&s;hes to do, is to take old Burnaby's farm; and you knows, Molly, one mu&s;t have a few pounds to &s;tock it. You &s;hall
<PB N="70" REF="72">have little Lucy Porter for your maid: and there we &s;hall live as happy as the day is long.&mdash;But I pray you, Molly, let us make an end of this bu&s;ine&s;s &s;oon; that uncle may not make any more delays.</P>
<P>All this appeared &s;o fair, and hone&s;t, and rea&s;onable to poor Molly, who had a gene|rous heart, that it overturned at once all her uncle's advice; and the very fir&s;t ac|count he had, after this, of the &s;teps &s;he meant to take, was from the mini&s;ter at church, who publi&s;hed the <HI>banns of Mar|riage between Richard Atkins, and Mary Somers, both of this pari&s;h.</HI> This ca&s;t a damp on all the congregation; for they all loved poor Molly, and &s;aw &s;he was a ruined woman.</P>
<P>Well, Molly, &s;aid her uncle, when he came from charch, I find you will take neither one part of my advice, nor the other. The mini&s;ter has ju&s;t been a&s;king, if any body <HI>knew any cau&s;e or ju&s;t impediment</HI> again&s;t your marriage? I have told you, Molly, <HI>many cau&s;es and ju&s;t impediments</HI> again&s;t it: but if you will not think &s;o your&s;elf, no|body el&s;e can think for you. I have now done with &s;peaking on the &s;ubject; and heartily wi&s;h you may find this change turn out to your happine&s;s.&mdash;I fear it much.</P>
<P>Poor Molly &s;oon found her uncle's fears too well grounded. Her marriage turned out, as every body expected it would do.
<PB N="71" REF="73">When Dick had gotten her money, he had gotten all he wanted. He had no intention of taking a farm. He carried her to a wretched cottage, almo&s;t naked of every nece&s;&s;ary. The very thatch was &s;o bad, that the rain trickled through in many places. But with regard to him&s;elf he &s;pared no ex|pence. The fir&s;t thing he did was to buy a hor&s;e; a new &s;addle; a pair of neat buck|&s;kin breeches; a pair of tight new boots; and bright &s;teel &s;purs, with the longe&s;t &s;hanks he could get. He was &s;eldom at home, which was poor Molly's chief comfort; for when he was at home, he was generally drunk; and attended by &s;ome of his vile companions. At the&s;e times &s;he was obliged to &s;ee &s;uch horrid &s;cenes of wickedne&s;s; and to hear &s;uch dreadful oaths, imprecations, and ob&s;ceni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, that her heart &s;unk within her; and &s;he wi&s;hed her&s;elf dead an hun|dred times. Dick took great offence at her <HI>mallan chollic humours,</HI> as he called them; and told her, he would never have married her, if he had known, &s;he had been &s;uch a mi&s;erable &s;oul. Poor Molly could an&s;wer him only with floods of tears&mdash;or with deep &s;ighs, when her heart was too big for &s;uch a vent. When &s;he was in her <HI>&s;ullens,</HI> as Dick would call the&s;e fits of de&s;pondency, he would &s;ometimes beat her; and once, or twice, he turned her out of doors; and told her, when &s;he had done blubbering, &s;he
<PB N="72" REF="74">might come in. Once, poor creature! &s;he &s;at all night in the cart-hou&s;e. His beha|viour was &s;o &s;hocking, that the neighbours interfered; and complained to the ju&s;tice, which poor Molly her&s;elf never would have done. The ju&s;tice &s;ent for Dick, and gave him &s;o &s;evere a reprimand, that for the future he refrained from beating her; but in all other re&s;pects, his behaviour was as brutal as ever.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of his wickedne&s;s Dick was &s;eized with a violent fever. He had been at a cock-fight, where he got drunk; and falling from his hor&s;e at night, he rolled into a wet ditch, and lay there till the morning, when he was found, and carried home almo&s;t dead. It cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, that his wife had much affection for him: but duty &s;up|plied the room of affection. His di&s;order increa&s;ed; and her attention increa&s;ed with it. For &s;everal nights her cloaths were never off; and the little nece&s;&s;aries &s;he got for him, &s;he was obliged to procure by &s;elling &s;omething or other, &s;he could ill &s;pare. But his blood was in &s;uch a cor|rupted &s;tate by a con&s;tant cour&s;e of drunken|ne&s;s, that the doctor &s;aid from the fir&s;t, there was but little hope of his recovery. Often when his fever ran high, he was almo&s;t raving mad; and his poor wife was obliged to get two or three of the neigh|bours to hold him down. In the&s;e fits he
<PB N="73" REF="75">would utter &s;uch dreadful things, as ter|rified all around him. Ah, poor &s;oul, &s;aid Tom Davis, I would not have thy con|&s;cience in me for fifty pound. At inter|vals however he was in his &s;en&s;es; but he was then in as dreadful a &s;tate. If ever he dropped a&s;leep for a moment; he &s;tarted, as if he had &s;een &s;omething terrible: and once or twice &s;taring wildly about him, he a&s;ked, Where it was? His wife bid him lie quiet, and told him there was nothing. But he cried out, He &s;aw it as plainly, as he did her. What he &s;aw nobody could tell: but it was plain, as Tom Davis &s;aid, that his guilty con&s;cience had taken hold of him.</P>
<P>One day when he was in a more com|po&s;ed &s;tate, his wife a&s;ked him, If he would like to &s;ee the mini&s;ter? to which he con&s;ented. The mini&s;ter came; and &s;itting down on a chair by his bed &s;ide, Well, Richard, &s;aid he, how do you feel your&s;elf?&mdash;Very bad, &s;ir, very bad indeed. &mdash;I fear you are, &s;aid the mini&s;ter: but what is your particular complaint?&mdash;I am all over bad, in&s;ide, and out&s;ide.&mdash;I &s;up|po&s;e you mean by that, &s;aid the mini&s;ter, that you think your &s;oul, and body both in a bad &s;tate. You have, no doubt, led a very wicked life; and if all be true, that I have heard, have been a very grievous &s;in|ner.&mdash;Too true, &s;ir, &s;aid Dick, too true;
<PB N="74" REF="76">the wor&s;e luck. Mother Pitman's hou&s;e has been the ruination of me.&mdash;Mother Pitman's hou&s;e, &s;aid the mini&s;ter, may be bad enough; and I believe it is. But mo|ther Pitman's hou&s;e is no excu&s;e for you. Nobody forced you into it. It was your own doing. Well-di&s;po&s;ed lads never go near mother Pitman's hou&s;e; nor any other hou&s;e, which they know is a wicked one; and will lead them into &s;in. But there is another hou&s;e, Richard, which I believe you never went near; and that is, the hou&s;e of God. If you had frequented that hou&s;e, as much as you did mother Pit|man's, it is probable you would not have been lying now in all this di&s;tre&s;s <HI>both in|&s;ide, and out&s;ide.</HI>&mdash;Here Dick, laying his hand on his head, (as an acute pain &s;hot through it), cried out, <HI>O God! O God!</HI>&mdash; Aye, Richard, &s;aid the mini&s;ter, (when the poor wretch was a little compo&s;ed,) the wickede&s;t people cry out upon God in their extremities. And this &s;hews, that all peo|ple naturally think God is their be&s;t friend in their di&s;tre&s;&s;es. If they would call upon him, as earne&s;tly in their health, as they do in their &s;ickne&s;s, how happy would it be for them!&mdash;<HI>I hope, &s;ir,</HI> &s;aid Dick, <HI>that I have &s;uffered &s;o much in this world, that God will be marciful to me in the next.</HI>&mdash; And then he mentioned &s;ome confu&s;ed ac|count he had heard of Je&s;us Chri&s;t's carry|ing
<PB N="75" REF="77">a thief to heaven, becau&s;e he had been crucified for his &s;ins.&mdash;I know of no &s;uch doctrine in &s;cripture, &s;aid the mini&s;ter, as that he who is puni&s;hed in this world, &s;hall for that rea&s;on e&s;cape puni&s;hment in the next. We know of no ground to ex|pect &s;alvation, but by leading good lives, and tru&s;ting in the merits of Chri&s;t to atone for our repented &s;ins&mdash;and the only re|pentance we know of, con&s;i&s;ts in a change of our hearts as well as our lives. But I have heard other &s;inners, Richard, be&s;ides you, lay great &s;tre&s;s on &s;he thief on the cro&s;s: but we have not the lea&s;t rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, he was &s;aved becau&s;e he was pu|ni&s;hed in this world; but becau&s;e that was the fir&s;t opportunity he had of knowing his duty, and acknowledging his ble&s;&s;ed Sa|viour. But it is a different ca&s;e, Richard, with tho&s;e who live in a chri&s;tian country. They have many opportunities. God gives us opportunities, Richard; and it is our part to make u&s;e of them. He has given you many. Every &s;unday you had an op|portunity. What an opportunity you lo&s;t, when you lived with your good old mi&s;tre&s;s at Grove-place! What an opportunity you lo&s;t, when you married this virtuous young woman, whom you have made &s;o mi&s;erable! I &s;ay not the&s;e things to add to your di&s;tre&s;s: but this is not a time for &s;elf-deceit; and I want to convince you,
<PB N="76" REF="78">that all the wickedne&s;s you have been guilty of, has ari&s;en more from your own wicked &s;elf; and the neglect of tho&s;e opportuni|ties, which God had given you; than from mother Pitman's hou&s;e, or your bad com|panions, who would never have &s;ought you, if you had not fir&s;t &s;ought them. All you can do now, is to have a deep &s;en&s;e of your own wickedne&s;s&mdash;to pray to God to forgive you through Chri&s;t&mdash;and to make &s;incere re&s;olutions, that if it &s;hould plea&s;e God to rai&s;e you up again, you will throughly change both your heart and life.</P>
<P>Contrary to the opinion of all people Dick recovered. The mini&s;ter, on this occa&s;ion, came to him again; and put him in mind of this farther great opportunity, which God had now given him. If this was neglected, he warned him of what the &s;cripture &s;aid of tho&s;e wicked per&s;ons, who&s;e <HI>latter end was wor&s;e than the begin|ning.</HI> Dick promi&s;ed every thing the mi|ni&s;ter wi&s;hed&mdash;he would take up entirely a new life&mdash;nobody &s;hould ever &s;ee him drunk again&mdash;nor &s;hould hear him &s;wear: but he would keep his church; and mind his work; and take care of his family.</P>
<P>One &s;hould have thought that all this would have been a &s;ufficient warning to this unhappy profligate&mdash;at lea&s;t for &s;ome time. Poor Molly hoped it, and began to rai&s;e her &s;pirits. But alas it turned out
<PB N="77" REF="79">otherwi&s;e. Let all young people take warning of this, and tremble. When they once get habits of wickedne&s;s, it is a dread|ful con&s;ideration, but it is a very true one, that they hardly ever leave them off. And though they may nor go &s;uch great lengths of wickedne&s;s, as Dick Atkins did (few people indeed do) they may be very bad, and yet far &s;hort of him. Be&s;ides, when they get once into the train of wickedne&s;s, it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay how far they may go. Let them take warning then from this un|happy young man, who had formed all the&s;e dreadful habits of wickedne&s;s before he was twenty-eight years of age.</P>
<P>By the time this vile young fellow had recovered his &s;trength, all his wicked ha|bits began again to appear: he forgot all his good re&s;olutions; and all the mini&s;ter had &s;aid to him; and as if he had been lo&s;ing time by his illne&s;s, he appeared as if determined to make it all up. He got again among his old companions; he drank, he &s;wore, he ranted, he roared; and out did the wor&s;t of them in wicked|ne&s;s; making good what the mini&s;ter told him, that if he did not grow better, <HI>his latter end would be wor&s;e than the beginning:</HI> for it is never the way of wickedne&s;s to keep at a &s;tand. His wife, as u&s;ual, was the object of his re&s;entment on all occa|&s;ions, when any thing di&s;plea&s;ed him.
<PB N="78" REF="80">She was always at hand for him to cur&s;e, as the cau&s;e of every mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>Thus they lived together about four years, and had in that time two children. No|thing could equal the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of poor Molly and her family. He <HI>would</HI> do no|thing; and &s;he <HI>could</HI> do nothing. She was naturally of a meek di&s;po&s;ition; and was now become &s;o &s;piritle&s;s, and broken-hearted, that &s;he could do little more than crawl about the hou&s;e, like a per&s;on half dead. Then would Dick cur&s;e her for a lazy jade. It was impo&s;&s;ible, he would tell her, for him to maintain the family alone, if &s;he would do nothing. If it had not been for her, and her brats, he could have maintained him&s;elf well enough. Poor Molly never gave him a word of an&s;wer; but &s;at leaning over the table, re&s;t|ing her head upon her right arm, and &s;troking the heads of her children, who &s;tood at her knee, perhaps crying for food. Her uncle was her only comfort; and in|deed her only &s;upport; for if it had not been for him, &s;he, and her family, mu&s;t have &s;tarved. But all that he could do was privately to do a kind thing, now and then, for her. For when a woman has ruined her&s;elf by an imprudent marriage, &s;he has put it out of the power of any body to a&s;&s;i&s;t her effectually. It is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;eparate her intere&s;t from her hu&s;band's: &s;o that
<PB N="79" REF="81">whatever is done for ber, is done to &s;up|port extravagance, and wickedne&s;s. Young women therefore cannot be too careful in keeping company with young men. They may very ea&s;ily be deceived. They are inexperienced them&s;elves; and had much better take the advice of their fathers and uncles, and other friends, than follow blindly their own fancies.&mdash;Let poor Molly's example be a warning to them.</P>
<P>After &s;uffering five years for her impru|dence, and folly, it plea&s;ed God at length to relea&s;e her. She was worn down by her afflictions; and being reduced to a mere &s;hadow, could &s;upport nature no longer. Her uncle was with her at her death; whom &s;he tenderly thanked for all his kindne&s;s. She was perfectly calm, and re&s;igned&mdash;&s;he ble&s;&s;ed God that her deliverance was &s;o near&mdash;and &s;aid &s;he had not been &s;o happy &s;ince the <HI>fatal day,</HI> as &s;he called it. A tear &s;tarted in her eye, as &s;he looked at her poor children, who were both a&s;leep on the &s;ame bed, on which &s;he lay expiring. Poor little wretches! &s;aid &s;he, I hope God will provide for you!&mdash;Oh! how I wi&s;h this &s;leep&mdash;but I will not &s;ay what I was going to &s;ay, for fear it &s;hould be wicked. &mdash;Then turning to her uncle, &s;he &s;aid, I dare not a&s;k you to have an eye to my poor children!&mdash;But let me be buried near the place where you will be buried; and ju&s;t
<PB N="80" REF="82">write over my grave, <HI>Here lies one who was deceived in marriage, and died of a broken heart:</HI> but do not put down my name.&mdash; Such was the end of an unfortunate young woman, who was every way qualified to have made a married &s;tate a comfort to her&s;elf, and every one connected with her; if &s;he had only acted with prudence!&mdash;One fatal &s;tep ruined her!</P>
<P>The melancholy event of his wife's death, of which Dick was as much the cau&s;e as if he had &s;hot her through the head with a pi&s;tol, had not the lea&s;t effect on him. He left his children to tho&s;e who cho&s;e to take care of them; and continued his plea&s;ures. The pari&s;h-officers calling a ve&s;try, got an order from the ju&s;tices to take him up. Dick hearing of it, or at lea&s;t &s;u&s;pecting it, left the country. What became of him, was long unknown. Some &s;aid he had been hanged at Glouce&s;ter for &s;tealing a hor&s;e. But it appeared afterwards that the fellow, who was hanged at Gloce&s;ter, was another ra&s;cal of his name. Others who knew his face well, &s;aid they had &s;een him in one of the hulks at Woolwich. But that too was a mi&s;take; and the&s;e reports only &s;hewed what people thought he de|&s;erved. At la&s;t however the true account, and all the particulars of his death, came to light. They were brought by a &s;ailor, one John Patter&s;on, who came to &s;ee
<PB N="81" REF="83">his aunt, Mary Green. The account was this.</P>
<P>After Dick left the country, he went to &s;ea with &s;ome &s;mugglers: but in their way from France, they were pur&s;ued by a cut|ter. When the cutter came up with them, they were imprudent enough to fire, and killed one of her men. The cutter how|ever &s;oon overpowered, and took them, and put all their hands in irons. Dick, who was wounded in the leg, and two others, wounded al&s;o, were &s;et on &s;hore, in a wild part of the country, on the coa&s;t of Lincoln&s;hire; and put under the care of an officer of the cu&s;toms, who happened to be going his rounds in tho&s;e parts. He could find no better place to put them into, than an old boat-hou&s;e on the beach, where they were laid on a bundle of &s;ea|weed. There was no furgeon nearer than Wainfleet, which was above twenty miles from the place. The officer therefore thinking they were not worth the trouble of &s;ending &s;o far, put them into the hands of a black-&s;mith, who was a &s;ort of far|rier; telling him they did not want any great matters of &s;urgery: <HI>Only get them well enough,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>to be hanged, that is all we want.</HI> Two of them were de&s;perately wounded, and died, one that afternoon, the other the next morning: but Dick, though di&s;abled by a hurt in his foot, might
<PB N="82" REF="84">have done well, if he had been carefully looked after. The black-&s;mith came every day, after he had done his work, and dre&s;&s;ed his wound, as well as he could, and brought him &s;omething to eat and drink. But as there was a di&s;pute about burying the dead bodies, they were not removed till they became in&s;ufferably offen&s;ive. The&s;e dead bodies, and his own guilty thoughts, were the only company which poor Dick had for &s;everal days. Such company, &s;uch neglect, &s;uch a &s;urgeon, &s;o hot a &s;ea&s;on, (for it was in the middle of a &s;ultry augu&s;t) together with the very corrupt &s;tate of his blood, it may be imagined, did not con|tribute to the cure of his wound. Neither, I &s;uppo&s;e, did the reflection, that as &s;oon as he got well enough, he &s;hould certainly be hanged. His wound &s;oon began to mortify, and grow ulcerous; in which ca&s;e the black-&s;mith had only to cut away every night, the putrid fle&s;h, which had cor|rupted in the day. The coar&s;e in&s;tru|ment, with which this daily bu&s;ine&s;s was performed, and the rough hand which performed it, put the wretched patient to intolerable pain. Patter&s;on &s;aid, he heard his &s;creams, though he was in a ve&s;&s;el, near a quarter of mile from the &s;hore. As the wound was in his foot, it was long before the mortification &s;eized the vital parts: but all his right leg and thigh were now
<PB N="83" REF="85">&s;o putrid, and horridly offen&s;ive, that the black-&s;mith declared, who would, might attend him, he could do it no longer. Se|venteen days from his landing he lay in this &s;hocking condition, before his mi&s;er|able life was ended. What his dying agony, and de&s;pairing thoughts were, no|body could tell, as he &s;pent all his dreadful hours by him&s;elf. All that Patter&s;on knew farther, was, that when the farrier came one evening to give him a little food, he found him dead; and convul&s;ed in &s;o dreadful a way, and his features &s;o terribly di&s;torted, that he &s;aid, he believed the devil was in the fellow, for he did not think a human body could by any natural means &s;uffer &s;uch di&s;tortion.</P>
<P>About the time of Dick's death, his &s;i&s;ter Nan al&s;o died; who had been as mi&s;erable a wretch as he had been. As Dick had ruined his wife, &s;he had ruined her hu&s;|band. In &s;earching the pari&s;h where Dick lived, for &s;ome farther particulars of his life, I found &s;ome, which related to his &s;i&s;ter Nan; and I hope the reader will think, they are worth relating, as an ex|ample to others.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="86">After the father's death, the widow and two daughters were carried, as was &s;aid, to the poor-hou&s;e; where the elder died. Nan was the younger, and &s;oon began to &s;hew her&s;elf to be one of the mo&s;t forward, impudent, na&s;ty, lying, lazy girls of the place. She had a down-ca&s;t look, which made &s;ome people believe her to be mode&s;t; but it was only &s;ullenne&s;s, in which &s;he abounded. At the age of thirteen, &s;he was put out as a pari&s;h apprentice, and had the good fortune to get into a place, where her ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s were well di&s;po&s;ed to be kind to her, and give her good in|&s;truction. But, like her brother Dick, &s;he did not improve the opportunies God gave her. As &s;he grew older, &s;he grew wor&s;e.</P>
<P>Her ma&s;ter would often &s;ay, Con&s;ider, Nanny, that every thing has its beginning; and among other things, wickedne&s;s. The devil fir&s;t tempts young people to little &s;ins. When they have gotten this le&s;&s;on perfectly, he proceeds to tempt them to greater.&mdash;But &s;uch good advice, and much more, was thrown away upon Nan. Every year added &s;omething to her wick|edne&s;s. She grew more lazy, more in&s;o|lent, more a liar, and more impudent. If any of her acquaintance advi&s;ed her to behave better to her ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;he would d&mdash;mn them both.&mdash;What did
<PB N="85" REF="87">&s;he care for them. She was but a pari&s;h prentice, and could not be wor&s;e than &s;he was&mdash;they might turn her away, if they liked. At length her behaviour became &s;o bad, that it plainly appeared &s;he wanted to force them to turn her away; which at la&s;t they did, being able to keep her no longer.</P>
<P>Thus with very little money, without character, without friends, poor Nan was left to the wide world. She did not how|ever find that plea&s;ure from liberty which &s;he expected. She &s;oon grew tired of do|ing nothing: for young people are much mi&s;taken, if they think idlene&s;s is the means of happine&s;s. None can enjoy true happine&s;s, but by doing their duty in that &s;tation, whatever it is, in which God hath placed them.&mdash;But Nan's being unhappy her&s;elf would have been of le&s;s con&s;equence, if &s;he had not been a pe&s;t to others. She was a nui&s;ance wherever &s;he came; and was the ruin of &s;everal poor lads about the country; who were fooli&s;h enough to li&s;ten to her.</P>
<P>Among others, there was a young fellow, who&s;e name was Harry Philip&s;on. He worked with farmer Hopkins; and was as good a lad as any in the country. He was very diligent; and his ma&s;ter was very fond of him; and could put more tru&s;t in him, than in any lad about the hou&s;e. He never
<PB N="86" REF="88">went to the ale-hou&s;e&mdash;never u&s;ed a bad word&mdash;went con&s;tantly to church&mdash;had a good coat for &s;undays; and allowed his poor mother a &s;hilling a week out of his wages. But this wicked woman ruined him.</P>
<P>He had been at the fair, where his chief errand was, to buy his mother a chee&s;e, and a pair of warm &s;tockings. He had done his bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;had &s;ent away his goods by his ma&s;ter's waggon, and was him&s;elf returning quietly home; plea&s;ing him&s;elf with carrying his mother the &s;tockings, which he knew &s;he wanted, but did not expect. At the town end he met &s;ome young fellows of his ac|quaintance, dringing at <HI>a barrel of beer</HI>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In &s;ome places, during fairs, people are allowed to &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> beer without a licence, which they do in booths, or &s;ome|times in the open air.</NOTE>. They were joyous and merry, and began to laugh at Harry for &s;neaking out of the fair, without affording him&s;elf a drop of beer like a man; but buying a halfpenny worth of gingerbread, like a child. In &s;hort, they overcame his mode&s;ty by laughing at him; and he took his mug and &s;at down among&s;t them. This was the beginning of all his misfortunes. He who will do one thing again&s;t his rea&s;on, will do another. John Trueman would have acted in a different way. If they had laughed at him for &s;neak|ing out of the fair, without a drop of liquor, he would have laughed at them again, and
<PB N="87" REF="89">told them, he &s;hould hear perhaps the next morning, that they had not been able to get out of the fair in any way. Or if he could have thought of nothing to &s;ay to them, he would have cried, Good night to you, my lads, good night to you; and have left them. Poor Philip&s;on, with all his goodne&s;s of heart, had not &s;o much re&s;olution. He was taken in; and &s;at drinking among them, till he had drunk far more than he ought.</P>
<P>As he was returning home through the fields, in the du&s;k of the evening, he met Nan Atkins, who was prowling about, on purpo&s;e to way-lay &s;ome or other, whom &s;he might accidentally meet from the fair: for her only livelihood now was the money &s;he got from the young fellows, whom &s;he en|&s;nared. Here Philip&s;on's fir&s;t fatal inter|cour&s;e began with this wicked, abandoned woman; which continued to go on, partly through her threatenings, and partly through her arts. If Philip&s;on had had the full u&s;e of his rea&s;on, when he fir&s;t met her, he might have &s;een the wickedne&s;s, and bad con&s;e|quences of &s;uch an acquaintance; and might have e&s;caped. But liquor had put the fear of God out of his mind; and he was now drawn &s;o far into her &s;nares, that he knew not how to get out. In the mean time he became quite an altered man. He u&s;ed to make &s;huffling excu&s;es to his ma&s;ter for neglecting his bu&s;ine&s;s. He learned bad words from his
<PB N="88" REF="90">bad companion. In&s;tead of going to church on &s;undays, he u&s;ed to prowl about the fore&s;t with Nan. All the money he could earn &s;he got from him. His poor mother u&s;ed to wonder what was the matter with Harry. He never came near her; and &s;he had not received a farthing from him for &s;everal weeks.</P>
<P>Nan had now lived &s;even or eight months in this vagabond way, when the pari&s;h offi|cers made it nece&s;&s;ary for her either to go to Bridewell, or to choo&s;e which of her lovers (for &s;he had all the idle young fellows of the country after her) &s;he would take for a hu&s;|band. She fixed at length on poor Philip|&s;on; and threatened him into a marriage.</P>
<P>She was now a married woman; and if &s;he had repented of her &s;ins, and changed her heart and life, and done her duty as &s;he ought, &s;he might yet have done well. Her hu&s;band had always been an indu&s;trious young fellow, and though &s;he had of late corrupted him, yet he was &s;till well di&s;po&s;ed, if &s;he had done her part. She too had good hands; and might have been a prudent wi&s;e, and a u&s;eful woman, if &s;he had plea&s;ed. But all the&s;e opportunities, which God put in her power, &s;he threw behind her.</P>
<P>On his marriage with this bad woman, Harry took a little cottage among a few hou&s;es that &s;tood by the common field. He &s;till worked with his old ma&s;ter, farmer Hopkins;
<PB N="89" REF="91">and determined to make up for his lo&s;t time. But he &s;oon found how unequally he was matched. When he came home from his day's work, in&s;tead of finding a bit of victuals; a clean fire-&s;ide; and a chearful look, he would find his door perhaps locked; and Nan gone, nobody could tell where; or perhaps he would find her drinking tea with two or three hu&s;|&s;eys, as na&s;ty, as idle, and as wicked, as her|&s;elf; and eating up perhaps the only remains of victuals in the hou&s;e. Harry would &s;it down, and looking about him, would a&s;k, if &s;he had not got a bit of victuals for his &s;upper? Nan would perhaps d&mdash;n him; and bid him look into the cup-board. If there was any thing there, he might take it: if not, &s;he could not get victuals without money. Sometimes al&s;o Harry would &s;ee a bit of a na&s;ty gauze cap; or a yard of ribbon; or a tawdry hat lying about. In &s;hort, all the money which he got at work, and which &s;he continued to get from him, went either in eating, or in buying finery. The poor fellow got little of it him&s;elf; and a poor, mi&s;erable, neglected child, &s;till le&s;s.</P>
<P>All this hurt poor Harry the more; be|cau&s;e when he went into Robin Jones's cot|tage, which was next to his, he &s;aw every thing neat, and comfortable. Robin had three children; and though he had no more to live on than Philip&s;on, yet Betty Jones
<PB N="90" REF="92">always kept them neat, and tight; their heads were always clean, and well combed; their hands and faces wa&s;hed; and their poor little coats were never ragged, though they were patched with clouts of twenty different co|lours: they always however looked ro&s;y, and healthy; and every body &s;aw at once that their mother took great care of them.&mdash;The hou&s;e too was as clean as the children. Both the tables &s;hined like a looking gla&s;s: the chairs were well rubbed; and the dre&s;&s;er always clean &s;cowered with white &s;and. On the &s;helves &s;tood half a dozen bright pewter plates; and as many earthen plates. Two of them indeed were broken; but as they &s;tood on the broken parts, they looked nearly as well as the others. They were meant only for &s;hew; for beneath them &s;tood a row of well-&s;cowered wooden platters, which the family eat off. There were &s;everal pots al&s;o, and pans, and bowls, and wooden &s;poons, all ranged in proper order; and all clean. But the be&s;t piece of furniture was a clock, which &s;tood in the corner, oppo&s;ite the door. They had bought it &s;oon after they began hou&s;e|keeping, at madam Stephens's &s;ale. It was that clock which &s;tood in the &s;ervant's hall. On one &s;ide of the clock, hung a picture of the king, in a fine red coat, laced with gold, and a crown upon his head. On the other &s;ide hung the queen, in a purple gown, with a crown likewi&s;e. Many ballads al&s;o hung
<PB N="91" REF="93">about in &s;everal places; but all neatly pa&s;ted to the wall. In the corner, by the &s;ide of the clock, &s;tood a broom, which was never weary, tho &s;omewhat worn out, with &s;weeping. If the children, or the pig, or the dog, brought in the lea&s;t dirt, up it got, and &s;wept all into the hearth in a moment. Poor Philip&s;on would come into this neat cottage in an evening, when he was locked out of his own, and would find his neighbour Robin &s;itting down to a me&s;s of warm broth, or a bit of hot bacon, and greens: Ah! Robin, Robin, he would &s;ay, how happy a man &s;hould I be, if my dame was like your's: but I got wrong at fir&s;t, God forgive me! and I have &s;uffered for it ever &s;ince. From looking into &s;uch a cottage as this, when Harry went into his own, he was &s;truck to the heart. There he &s;aw every thing &s;lovenly and dirty. The table was always &s;wimming with &s;ome na&s;ty &s;lop. There was never a chair to &s;it down on: the little things which Harry had got into his hou&s;e on their marriage, were all broken, or de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>All that poor Harry could do, to bring his wife to a better mind, he attempted. He coaxed her, and treated her kindly. Why now, Nanny, he would &s;ay, cannot you keep your hou&s;e as clean, and neat, as Betty Jones keeps her's? Don't you think, there would be more comfort, and happine&s;s in it? You know, Nanny, I bring you home all I
<PB N="92" REF="94">earn; and one might expect a little comfort for it. But one can hardly &s;it down, or lay one's hat on a table, without getting into &s;ome na&s;tine&s;s. If Nan happened to be in better temper, &s;he would tell him, he was not &s;o clean, that he needed to fear a little dirt. Or if &s;he was in a bad temper, which was com|monly the ca&s;e, &s;he would d&mdash;n him, (with which language &s;he generally began her &s;peeches) and bid him go to Bet Jones's, if he liked being there &s;o well.&mdash;All attempts to reclaim her were however in vain. She grew wor&s;e, in&s;tead of better; and confounded and ruined every thing. Poor Harry, in the mean time, could not even buy a jacket for him&s;elf; but went about, one of the raggede&s;t poor fellows in the pari&s;h.&mdash;Some of the neighbours u&s;ed to &s;ay, that Nan drank. How that was, I do not know. She came to dram|ming afterwards; but I do not find that &s;he had yet begun.</P>
<P>Poor Harry was at length, however, quite tired out. He could bear her wicked ways, and ill u&s;age no longer. In&s;tead therefore of giving her all he earned at the week's end, and coming home in an evening, he kept his money in his pocket, giving her only a part; and went to the alehou&s;e, when he came from his work.</P>
<P>This was certainly making bad wor&s;e. Young fellows cannot be too careful before they marry: but when they are ill married, they
<PB N="93" REF="95">mu&s;t bear it as an evil they have brought on them&s;elves; and mu&s;t make the be&s;t of it.&mdash; Harry's new way of life, of cour&s;e, was the cau&s;e of new mi&s;ery. While he brought Nan all he earned to lay out on her&s;elf, things did not come to the wor&s;t. But when &s;he was put to allowance, and felt her&s;elf pinched, &s;he raged like a wild bea&s;t. Not that I blame Harry for putting her thus to allowance: all I blame him for, was &s;pending his money at the ale-hou&s;e: for drinking never did any man good; or made him happier in whatever way he was mi&s;erable. If he drink for comfort, he never finds it. When he is drunk, it is true, he does not feel the mi&s;ery he wi&s;hed to forget: but when he is &s;ober again, his mi&s;ery is increa&s;ed. It happened &s;o on this occa&s;ion. Harry's cottage, which was wretched before, became now a &s;cene of horror. Whenever he came home, Nan attacked him with all the virulence of foul language, which generally ended in blows. Harry only defended him|&s;elf, if he had any remains of rea&s;on left: but &s;ometimes he was quite drunk; and would then give her a &s;ound drubbing. Many a time the neighbourhood was alarmed with cries of murder; and he has been found by the neigh|bours perhaps holding her back by her hair; or &s;he &s;tanding over him with a butcher's knife, &s;wearing a thou&s;and horrid oaths, that &s;he would &s;tick it into him: while the poor child was &s;creaming with terror; and ready to
<PB N="94" REF="96">fall into fits. In one of the&s;e horrid encounters they both &s;uffered great damage. Harry lo&s;t an eye by the edge of an iron candle&s;tick, which Nan threw at his head; and &s;he, in the &s;cuffle, fell again&s;t the corner of a table, and received a very bad brui&s;e upon her brea&s;t. All the neighbours however pitied poor Harry; and &s;ome advi&s;ed him to go to a ju&s;tice, and &s;wear the peace again&s;t her. But Harry would not con&s;ent.</P>
<P>One day however, as he was lamenting his misfortunes to his neighbour Robin Jones; I think verily, &s;aid Robin, if you will follow my advice, we can mend her, if we can|not cure her. So he mentioned the &s;cheme he had in his head to Harry, who approved it. Well then, &s;aid Robin, the next time &s;he is ob&s;tropulous, only go to the door, and whi&s;tle.</P>
<P>An opportunity &s;oon happened. Nan was <HI>ob&s;tropulous</HI> the next morning. It was Sa|turday; and as Harry was going out to work, Nan began by calling him a lou&s;y villain, and threatened with an oath to beat out his brains, if he did not bring home all the money he received for his week's pay. Harry &s;eeing the &s;torm beginning to ri&s;e, &s;tepped to the door, and whi&s;tled. Robin, who knew the &s;ign, in&s;tantly came in with a good cord in his hand. They then &s;eized poor Nan by her arms; and having pinioned her, tied her tight to an old elbow-chair;
<PB N="95" REF="97">and then fa&s;tened the chair to the wall. Now, &s;ays Harry, I'll leave you there, Nan|ny, to cool a little. So he carried the child to Betty Jones, locked the door, put the key in his pocket, and went to his work. Nan yelled terribly: but as all the neighbour|hood knew the cau&s;e, and came to the win|dow only to laugh at her; &s;he was tired at la&s;t with &s;creaming for the entertainment of her neighbours, and &s;at &s;ullen. Harry &s;eldom came from his work, till the evening; but on this occa&s;ion he came home at breakfa&s;t time. Well, Nanny, &s;aid he, if you will pro|mi&s;e to be good, I'll loo&s;e you, and you &s;hall have &s;ome victuals. Nan was &s;ullen. She would not &s;peak; but only &s;pit at him, and made faces. Ju&s;t as you like, &s;aid he, Nan|ny: &s;o he locked the door again, and went to his work.</P>
<P>At dinner-time he returned. Nan had then found the u&s;e of her &s;peech: but only to abu&s;e him for a cur&s;ed villain, intending, as &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed, to &s;tarve her to death. Many of the neighbours coming in, and mocking her; Harry was inclined to let her loo&s;e. But Robin Jones whi&s;pered him in the ear, You fool, if you do, we have done no good yet. So Harry contented him&s;elf with &s;ay|ing; All the neighbours, Nanny, can witne&s;s, that I offer to let you loo&s;e, and give you victuals, if you will only promi&s;e to be good. &mdash;How can you make her promi&s;e any &s;uch
<PB N="96" REF="98">thing, &s;aid Jenny Sloper; we all know what a quiet, good creature &s;he has always been; and what a wicked fellow you have been to her. Never fear, Nan, we'll bear witne&s;s for you.&mdash;I have often heard, &s;aid Nanny Bates, of being bound to peace, and good behaviour; but I never &s;aw it till now.&mdash;But neither the kind &s;peeches of her hu&s;band, nor the taunts of her neighbours, had any effect on Nan. She &s;at &s;ullen, and only &s;pit at them, or made faces. So Harry locked up the door once more; and went to his work. When he returned at night, Nan continued &s;till un|tractable. He offered to loo&s;e her. He of|fered her victuals. She was quite &s;ullen. So he &s;at quietly down to his &s;upper; and between every mouthful a&s;king her delibe|rately, if &s;he would be good? or, what plea&s;ure &s;he could take in being &s;o <HI>ob&s;tropu|lous?</HI> he made an end of his meal; and taking the candle to go up &s;tairs, Well, Nan|ny, &s;aid he, good night to you; I am &s;orry you will not behave better.&mdash;He had deter|mined however at any rate not to keep her tied up all night: but ju&s;t to try this one more expedient. Nan however not knowing his intention, and fearing the wor&s;t, was at length &s;ubdued; and as he was going up &s;tairs, called out; You may loo&s;e me, if you will. Harry, who had not heard &s;o meek a note from her a long time, came down, and a&s;ked her, if &s;he intended now to be good? On re|ceiving
<PB N="97" REF="99">a milder an&s;wer, than he expected, he immediately loo&s;ed her. Nan bur&s;t into a flood of tears, in a &s;ort of hy&s;teric fit; and Harry was terribly afraid he had gone too far. However, after taking a little victuals, and drink, &s;he recovered: but was very &s;ul|len, and &s;aid little or nothing.</P>
<P>The next morning, when Harry went to his work, Nan went to ju&s;tice Wil&s;on, and made oath of the u&s;age &s;he had &s;uffered. Sir Thomas was very angry; he had never heard of &s;uch a thing before; and re&s;olved to make an example of poor Harry. So he ap|pointed ten o'clock the next morning to in|quire into the matter, and ordered &s;everal of the neighbours to attend. But when he had found out all the truth, he changed his mind; and told Nan, he did not much like inter|fering between man, and wife; and advi&s;ed her hu&s;band, and her to make the matter up. Sir Thomas however called Harry privately; and told him, It was very true, his wife had given him great provocation; but &s;till, &s;aid he, I do not approve the method you took. You had better have brought your complaint to me; and I would have bound her over: and if &s;he could not have found bail, as I &s;up|po&s;e &s;he could not, I &s;hould have &s;ent her to Bridewell. There are &s;eparate cells now, in which bad people are kept, without being allowed to &s;peak to any body. The&s;e places &s;oon bring them to rea&s;on. Harry pro|mi&s;ed
<PB N="98" REF="100">Sir Thomas, he never would tie her up again; but begged his wor&s;hip would be &s;o good, as not to mention his having found fault with him.</P>
<P>It was a fortunate thing however for Harry, that Nan went to the ju&s;tice; for &s;he now found there was no remedy: and though &s;he continued &s;till very bad&mdash;neglected her hu&s;|band&mdash;her child, and her hou&s;e; yet &s;he never broke out into that violence of temper, which &s;he u&s;ed to do. If ever any thing of that kind appeared, Harry quieted her imme|diately by going to the door, and threatening to <HI>whi&s;tle for Robin Jones.</HI></P>
<P>But though Nan was better as to the vio|lence of her temper, yet there are &s;o many kinds of wickedne&s;s, which bad people run into, that they are never at a lo&s;s. It was about this time, I believe, that Nan took to drinking. I have heard, that &s;he was given to it before: but from the be&s;t accounts I can gather, I rather think, as I have already ob|&s;erved, &s;he did not take to it till now. In bad men this vice begins often in early youth: but in women, I believe, it &s;eldom appears &s;o early.</P>
<P>At a little lonely hou&s;e on the edge of the common, lived Bet Web&s;ter, a vile hu&s;&s;ey, who kept a pot-hou&s;e. Here Nan u&s;ed re|gularly to go, &s;ometimes taking her child, and &s;ometimes locking it up; and here &s;he u&s;ed to carry whatever &s;he could get, to
<PB N="99" REF="101">pawn. A pot of beer, or a gla&s;s of gin, Nan thought the greate&s;t comfort which the world could afford. But as the continuance of this plea&s;ure grew too expen&s;ive for her, &s;he con|ceived the de&s;ign of &s;etting up a pot-hou&s;e her&s;elf. Harry was much again&s;t it. He told her, he never knew a pot-hou&s;e come to good; and had known three or four of them broken up within the&s;e two years. How|ever, for peace and quietne&s;s &s;ake, he at length con&s;ented. So with the fir&s;t money they earned, they bought a couple of ca&s;ks&mdash; two or three mugs&mdash;a little malt&mdash;a &s;mall firking of gin, of the &s;mugglers; and two or three gla&s;&s;es with only &s;hanks, which they got cheap, and which &s;tood as well upon their mouths; as if they had had bottoms. The hou&s;e being thus furni&s;hed as a pot|hou&s;e, was pre&s;ently frequented by all the roaring, idle, drinking, &s;wearing fellows in the neighbourhood. In this &s;hocking way of life Nan continued two months, and was a great nui&s;ance to the neighbourhood. The gentle|men, the farmers, and the trade&s;men, all complained, that their &s;ervants, and ap|prentices, were corrupted. At length the matter came to &s;uch an height, that &s;pies were &s;et upon the hou&s;e; and an information on oath laid before Sir Thomas Wil&s;on. Harry was fined five pounds; and was obliged to pay it by &s;elling a cow and a little fore&s;t mare, which his late uncle Robert had ju&s;t
<PB N="100" REF="102">left him
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the la&s;t edition of this work it was &s;aid, that Harry had <HI>bought</HI> the cow, and the fore&s;t mare, which appeared to me very unlikely, as I knew not how he could rai&s;e money for &s;uch a purcha&s;e. On farther inquiry, I find he did not <HI>buy</HI> them; but received them, as I have now &s;tated the mat|ter, in a <HI>legacy.</HI></NOTE>. This affair hurt him very much; and the more, as he had always been again&s;t their &s;elling liquor. He had now lo&s;t ten times as much by it, as he had ever gained.</P>
<P>But Nan could not much longer have car|ried on her bu&s;ine&s;s, if this &s;top had not been put to it. The mi&s;chief &s;he did her&s;elf, when in the violence of her temper, &s;he fell again&s;t the edge of a table, began now to &s;hew it|&s;elf. It was a very ugly brui&s;e; and had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ong been black, inflamed, and painful: but it now through neglect began to mortify, and became cancerous. Her con&s;tant gin-drink|ing too, had heated her blood to &s;uch a de|gree, as to make the evil much wor&s;e. Thus do we continually bring misfortunes and mi&s;|chiefs on our&s;elves, which the goodne&s;s of God would never have brought upon us! Her pains, (poor wretch!) became intoler|able. She had no re&s;t either by day or night; and her &s;tench was &s;uch, that nobody could bear to come near her. Among&s;t all her di&s;tre&s;&s;es, her bad con&s;cience was not the lea&s;t. Many a time &s;he thought how happy &s;he might have been, if &s;he had acted as &s;he ought. But all was now over. The pari&s;h|doctor
<PB N="101" REF="103">told her, he could do nothing more for her; and &s;he mu&s;t expect to die in a little time. She would have prayed to God; but &s;he had never prayed in all her life; and knew not how to begin. She was afraid to &s;end for the mini&s;ter, who&s;e face &s;he hardly knew. Her hu&s;band did all he could for her, though &s;he had de&s;erved &s;o little at his hands: but nothing could ea&s;e her pains, which &s;hot through her body: and nothing could ea&s;e her con&s;cience, which &s;hot through her mind. She lived about &s;ix weeks in this mi&s;erable way; and when &s;he died, every one thought a nui&s;ance was removed from the earth.</P>
<P>After her death, Harry, who had &s;een &s;uch a dreadful example before him, took up a new life. He left off drinking. Nobody ever &s;aw him again at the ale-hou&s;e. He got his &s;i&s;ter Jenny, who lived with farmer Styles, to take care of his hou&s;e, and child. It is &s;urpri&s;ing how that poor little wretch had &s;urvived all the ill u&s;age it had received from its mother: but &s;omehow or other, through the kind hand of Providence, it had grown up to be &s;ix years of age. It was yet too young to have learned a bad example from its mother: and its father, and aunt, now &s;et it a very good one. Harry had a pair of good hands, and was very indu&s;|trious&mdash;made a great deal of money&mdash;&s;pent it all at home, as he &s;hould do; and having
<PB N="102" REF="104">paid a &s;evere price for the folly and wicked|ne&s;s of his youth, in being connected with that bad woman, he once more &s;aw happy days through the ble&s;&s;ing of God&mdash;and was an example of that great truth, (which he would often acknowledge,) that wickedne&s;s always brings its own puni&s;hment with it, even in this world; and that the poore&s;t man may be as happy as the riche&s;t, if he will only u&s;e &s;uch means as God hath put in his power.</P>
