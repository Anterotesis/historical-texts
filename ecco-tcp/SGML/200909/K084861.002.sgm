<P>I CONGRATULATE my|&s;elf that, unaccu&s;tom'd as I am to make Addre&s;&s;es of this publick Nature, &s;uch a Subject, &s;uch a Theme as your&s;elf has pre|&s;ented:
<PB N="ii" REF="4">YOU, Sir, on whom even the unpractis'd Tongue mu&s;t dwell with &s;uch Rapture, as to be at a Lo&s;s rather where to &s;top, than how to begin: YOU, who never have been de|tain'd by Intere&s;t, or Indo|lence, di&s;tracted by Plea|&s;ure, or diverted by Sleep for &s;o many Years from the Offices of Friend&s;hip and Humanity: YOU, who &s;pend the recollective Hour
<PB N="iii" REF="5">in the plea&s;ing Review of the&s;e Virtues, while others are pur&s;uing the Views of Intere&s;t, exploring new Plea&s;ures, new Preferments, are repo&s;ing the Body, or unbending the Mind in Fea&s;ting, in Quadrille and Diver&s;ion.</P>
<P>HAD not your Mind, Sir, been enlighten'd by the SUN of SCIENCE, you mu&s;t have enjoy'd, by the almo&s;t divine Intelligence
<PB N="iv" REF="6">of your own Nature, every good Quality, every ami|able Virtue, and of your|&s;elf have acquired the Love and Veneration of Man|kind: But now this intel|ligent improvable Nature is a&s;&s;i&s;ted by poli&s;h'd Edu|cation, and regular Study, we &s;ee the lovely Ideas you have drawn from their Ex|cellence, by which you have regulated your Con|duct both as a Mini&s;ter and
<PB N="v" REF="7">a Magi&s;trate, and at once improv'd your Head and your Heart. Important Le&s;&s;on to the GREAT! to teach them what Merit there is in an exalted Mind or an inward Grandeur of Soul, which gives Maje&s;ty and Splendor to every Thought, Action, or Di&s;|cour&s;e.</P>
<P>I SHOULD enlarge up|on this Topick, but what I expre&s;s is, I am afraid,
<PB N="vi" REF="8">unequal to what I feel; and I forget that my Bu&s;ine&s;s at pre&s;ent is not to &s;earch for Materials, but to &s;et Bounds to my Dedication; and if I err in any Ex|treme, it &s;hall be that of too much Caution, rather than too little Prudence.

<PB N="vii" REF="9">very high above the Rank of other Men, which may &s;et them at, perhaps, too great a Di&s;tance from the Love of their Inferiors, and make us often pa&s;s them over with a &s;ilent fort of Di&s;regard, e&s;pecially if they are &s;uch as OTWAY de&s;cribes,

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is very ob&s;ervable, that there is hardly any Topick more di&s;|cour&s;ed of by the CLERGY to the People, than that of the Nece&s;&s;ity of bringing all our Actions under the Rules of Religion, and making the Wi&s;dom of the Chri&s;tian Spi|rit be the vi&s;ible Exerci&s;e and De|mon&s;trations of our LOVE to GOD;
<PB N="ii" REF="14">and yet, I believe, there is none le&s;s put in Practice than this very Thing. 'Tis ordinary to &s;ee Men go to Church, and even fearful of being ab&s;ent from thence; and yet &s;ee them &s;pend all the re&s;t of their Time by Humour or Chance, ju&s;t as if they never had been there, or had heard nothing at all that con|cern'd them. And if you was to ask them the Rea&s;on of their not living to &s;uch Ends as are &s;uitable to the Glory of God, and why their Lives are not of the &s;ame Nature with their Devotions, full of the &s;ame excellent Spirit, the &s;ame Wi&s;|dom, the &s;ame Holine&s;s and hea|venly Tempers, they immediately
<PB N="iii" REF="15">would tell you, that they live as well, and as much unto GOD, in all the ordinary Occurrences and Ac|tions of their Lives, as the PAR|SON of their Pari&s;h does; (very &s;el|dom does their Chri&s;tianity afford him a more re&s;pectful Appellation) and that they matter not what is &s;aid about Wi&s;dom or Religion, as long as they are &s;ure they act as wi&s;ely and religiou&s;ly as he, mean|ing their MINISTER; and, be|&s;ides, (&s;ay they) if there was any &s;uch Nece&s;&s;ity for bringing all our Actions under the Rules of Reli|gion, or any Excellency or Wi&s;dom in being of &s;uch a Spirit as you talk of, &s;urely! our PARSON would
<PB N="iv" REF="16">live otherwi&s;e than he does. 'Tis true, we often hear him commend the&s;e Things hugely in his Ser|mons; but we do not di&s;cover that in his ordinary Life he a|&s;pires much more after it than our&s;elves.</P>
<P>THUS, you &s;ee, how malapert People are in their Replies, when they are ask'd to account for their unrea&s;onable and ab&s;urd Ways of Life. You no &s;ooner can advi&s;e them to live by Rea&s;on, to &s;tudy the Perfection of their Natures, to model and frame their Lives ac|cording to the Doctrines of our BLESSED SAVIOUR and his
<PB N="v" REF="17">APOSTLES, to pre&s;cribe Rules and Ends to every Action that re|lates to common Life, to let the Wi&s;dom of the Chri&s;tian Spirit be the vi&s;ible Exerci&s;e and Demon|&s;tration of their LOVE to GOD, to live as primitive Saints in &s;pi|ritual Watching, in holy Fear, and heavenly a&s;piring and earne&s;t long|ing after Immortality; I &s;ay, you can no &s;ooner tell them of the Practice of the&s;e Things, but they think you talk <HI>exceeding &s;trangely,</HI> and that you &s;eem, like St PAUL at ATHENS, a &s;etter forth of odd kind of Doctrines; and in&s;tead of returning you a mode&s;t An&s;wer, bid you look at the CLERGY,
<PB N="vi" REF="18">thinking thereby to &s;top your Mouth at once.</P>
<P>THE Truth is, the&s;e People per|ceive that &s;ome of the Clergy in their Way of Life, their u&s;ual Manner of &s;pending their Time and Fortunes, their Inquietudes, Cares, and Fears, in their Recreations, Plea&s;ures, and Indulgences, in their &s;piritual Labours, daily Bu&s;ine&s;s, and Devotions, they are not much unlike the re&s;t of the World. This is it that makes the LIBERTINE and the FOP, the carele&s;s and incon|&s;iderate Part of Mankind, &s;et &s;o lit|tle E&s;timation on the exact Piety and regular Devotions of indu&s;tri|ous
<PB N="vii" REF="19">Clergymen, becau&s;e they &s;ee the Devotions of others extend no farther than the reading of Prayers, and preaching of Ser|mons; (and tho&s;e they alledge &s;ometimes are none of their own) and when divine Service is over, they live no more unto GOD, till the Time of performing it returns again; but live by the &s;ame Hu|mour and Fancy, and in as full a Fruition of the Follies of Life as other Men&mdash;No Wonder then that Mini&s;ters, the Me&s;&s;engers of the King of Heaven, meet with &s;o little Re&s;pect in the Di&s;charge of their &s;acred Employment! They do not ALL burn, it &s;eems, with Zeal for
<PB N="viii" REF="20">the Salvation of Souls, and &s;tudy to redeem Children unto GOD: Some of them appear to have no other Spirit of Religion but that of occa&s;ional Wor&s;hip; their chief and ruling Tempers, 'tis &s;aid, if examin|ed according to the main and greate&s;t Articles of their Lives, or the mo&s;t glorious Doctrines of the Go&s;pel, have but little of the Spirit of an APOSTLE; but little Conformity to the Wi&s;dom, Purity, and Holi|ne&s;s of the Chri&s;tian Spirit; but lit|tle heavenly Love, &s;uitable to the high Expectations of another Life; but little Humility, but little PO|VERTY of SPIRIT; tho' 'tis re|commended by our SAVIOUR as
<PB N="ix" REF="21">the noble&s;t State of the Soul of Man; but little Forbearance and Long-&s;uffering, but little Conde|&s;cen&s;ion to the Weakne&s;&s;es and In|firmities of their Brethren, but little Love for their Excellencies; give but little Encouragement to their Virtues, but little Relief in their Wants; have little Rejoicing in their Pro&s;perity, and, in a Word, as little Compa&s;&s;ion in their Di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>THESE may be &s;ome of the many Rea&s;ons, perhaps, why the Names of PARSON, PRIEST, and LEVITE, are become Names of Reproach, and a BYE-WORD a|mong&s;t the People.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="22">PALMERIUS (they tell you) is a &s;ober temperate Clergyman, of con&s;iderable Preferment in the World, but of little Reputation with his Pari&s;hioners; his Living being about a Hundred Pound a Year, he has farmed it out to a poor Tenant, for Forty Pounds more than any Tenant could po&s;&s;ibly pay, and keep Body and Soul (as we &s;ay) to|gether comfortably. As he has two Churches that require Attendance once at each Place every <HI>Sunday,</HI> and he does not chu&s;e to re&s;ide there him&s;elf, but rather &s;ix or &s;even Miles from it; &s;o he makes it Mat|ter of Con&s;cience to maintain a Cu|rate that is as little beloved as him|&s;elf,
<PB N="xi" REF="23">of the &s;ame Tempers, and e|qually vain in his De&s;ires; whom he hires to look after the Souls of a large Pari&s;h, at as low and rea&s;on|able a Rate, as a Man of notorious Temperance can be had.</P>
<P>PALMERIUS has a great Va|lue for our pre&s;ent Government, and a like E&s;teem of our Common Prayer, is reckon'd very orthodox in his Di&s;cour&s;es; and as often as he vi&s;its his Pari&s;h, (which is as of|ten as he has Rent to take, or the Holy Sacrament to admini&s;ter) he is commonly very laborious in gi|ving them a good Sermon out of BRADY or TILLOTSON, to con|vince
<PB N="xii" REF="24">his Hearers of the Nece&s;&s;ity and Importance of <HI>running the Race that is &s;et before them.</HI></P>
<P>PALMERIUS has had no great Rea&s;on (they &s;ay) to complain of ill Fortune in the Cour&s;e of his Mi|ni&s;try; only he has had tho&s;e In|quietudes, Cares, and Fears, that they have, who are worldly or earthly-minded in their Employ|ments, and are carried on with vain De&s;ires and covetous Tempers. The Stubbornne&s;s and Ill-nature of his Pari&s;hioners, the Neglect and Re|mi&s;&s;ne&s;s of his Predece&s;&s;or, the Tor|ment, Unea&s;ine&s;s, and Vexation he had in ejecting an old Tenant, are
<PB N="xiii" REF="25">often the Subjects of his Conver&s;a|tion; and tho' he enjoys better than Two Hundred Pounds a Year, yet the want of higher Preferment is a great Pre&s;&s;ure upon his Spirits.</P>
<P>PALMERIUS is full of E&s;teem for Shew and Equipage, and fine Buildings. He has lately con&s;umed &s;ome Part of his Wife's Fortune in erecting a new Structure to the End of his Par&s;onage-Hou&s;e; not with a De&s;ign ever to live in it, but for his better Appearance as often as he comes among his Pari&s;hioners; and is now very angry at the Buil|ders of the old Dwelling for placing the Windows towards the Church-Yard,
<PB N="xiv" REF="26">it being &s;o melancholy a Sight, he &s;ays, never to have any thing before one's Eyes but TOMBS, GRAVE-STONES, and REPOSI|TORIES for the DEAD.&mdash;He can|not endure it, and therefore is re|&s;olved to turn them another Way.</P>
<P>NOW if you was to wait upon PALMERIUS at his Hou&s;e, (they tell you) you would find him the Companion of the &s;illie&s;t People in their mo&s;t &s;illy Plea&s;ures, fond of every impertinent Entertain|ment and Diver&s;ion, full of E&s;teem for Quadrille, a great Admirer of Plays, and mo&s;t of the ludicrous Pamphlets that come from the
<PB N="xv" REF="27">Pre&s;s, an admirable Lover of an <HI>idle go&s;&s;iping</HI> Conver&s;ation; and if there is any Mi&s;repre&s;entation of the Character of a Per&s;on, or any ill Report that tends to the Dimi|nution of his good Name, or the Pro&s;perity of his Condition, again&s;t whom he allows him&s;elf in fooli&s;h Hatreds and Re&s;entments, you may be &s;ure it lo&s;es nothing by being told by PALMERIUS; nay, if no|thing can be &s;aid in Prejudice of the Party &s;o di&s;re&s;pected, PALMERIUS will mo&s;t commonly trump up &s;omething or other, to tell tho&s;e with whom he lives in fooli&s;h Friend&s;hips and Fondne&s;&s;es; who are no &s;ooner behind his Back but
<PB N="xvi" REF="28">they laugh at him, to &s;ee his poor vulgar Way of Re&s;entment. &mdash; But the be&s;t of it (&s;ay they) is, PAL|MERIUS never &s;wears any, or ut|ters any Oaths, unle&s;s it is upon Oc|ca&s;ion, when his Coachman and Ser|vants do not plea&s;e him; and then no more than becomes a Gentleman of his Spirit and Di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>AGAIN, (they tell you) if you was to be with PALMERIUS but for one Day, you would hardly mi&s;s of hearing him tell of the Beauty, Fa&s;hion, and Richne&s;s, of the Fur|niture of his Hou&s;e; of the Neat|ne&s;s and Regularity of his Gardens; the Commodiou&s;ne&s;s of his Sum|mer-Hou&s;e,
<PB N="xvii" REF="29">and the Loveline&s;s of his Fi&s;h-Ponds; nay, &s;ometimes he would be &s;o trifling as to tell you of the Quantity of his Poultry, how he ri&s;es early every Morning to feed them, and which Chicken he de|&s;igns to kill next.</P>
<P>THUS, you &s;ee, what a Mixture of Ridicule the World ob&s;erves in the Life of PALMERIUS; and what &s;ort of Conclu&s;ions are drawn from it is but too evident. Men are glad to find their Teachers &s;et them &s;uch Copies in Vice and Im|morality; and are never &s;o well pleas'd, as when they find &s;uch as
<PB N="xviii" REF="30">PALMERIUS give them a Plea for their Sins.</P>
<P>BUT now, if &s;uch as PALME|RIUS, to be <HI>even</HI> with the World, would but renounce all their evil Habits and Tempers, and idle Di&s;|po&s;itions, their Fondne&s;s for great Preferment, Shew, and Di&s;tinction, their Self-Love, Pride, and Indul|gence, their fooli&s;h Friend&s;hips and groundle&s;s Hatreds, their Levity of Mind and trifling Spirit, their vain Ways of con&s;uming their Time and Money, their Love for &s;illy Diver|&s;ions and corrupt Conver&s;ation; would they but deny them&s;elves the Practice of the&s;e Things, and
<PB N="xix" REF="31">propo&s;e to them&s;elves the Example of &s;ome primitive Clergyman in the Church, who lived in its be&s;t and pure&s;t Ages; who dur&s;t not al|low him&s;elf in the Indulgence of any, even the lea&s;t of the&s;e Tem|pers; how &s;oon would they re|deem the dying Honour of the Prie&s;thood, re&s;tore its ancient Pu|rity, &s;top the Mouths of carele&s;s and worldly Men, and make the Mini&s;try become again a glorious Mini&s;try? Then beautiful would be the Lives of tho&s;e who attend at the ALTAR of our LORD and SAVIOUR JESUS CHRIST; then the People would have no Rea&s;on to complain, unle&s;s it was, becau&s;e
<PB N="xx" REF="32">they could not &s;erve, prai&s;e, and glorify GOD enough.</P>
<P>I COULD wi&s;h that Men of known Wi&s;dom, Power, and Autho|rity, would (in Imitation of our BLESSED LORD) dare to break through all the irreligious Cu&s;toms, Deri&s;ions, and Oppo&s;itions of the World, and &s;peak more zealou&s;ly of GOD and Religion, and more heartily of &s;erious Truths: For, by this, they would highly promote the Chri&s;tian Cau&s;e, and gradually recover the Primitive Holine&s;s, and Apo&s;tolick Stedfa&s;tne&s;s; by this, they would fill Heaven with Saints, and fini&s;h a Kingdom of eternal
<PB N="xxi" REF="33">Glory unto GOD. In a Word, by this they would confirm and edify good Men in their Piety, and in|&s;en&s;ibly work upon evil ones; for by &s;etting before them &s;uch a regu|lar and uninterrupted Pattern of Virtue and Goodne&s;s, they would either be inclined to imitate it, or, at lea&s;t, be re&s;trained from being &s;o barefacedly wicked, and &s;o &s;can|dalou&s;ly abandon'd, as now they are.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_GODLINESS comes &s;trongly re|commended to our Practice, when Rivers of Plea&s;ure are placed on her Right Hand, and in her Left Riches and Honour. Rewards are always look'd upon as great Incentives to act well in the various Scenes of Life; and, one would ima|gine, that Mankind would endeavour, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, to make their Goodne&s;s proportionable to the pre&s;ent Good they receive, or to the Re|ward in Rever&s;ion. But notwith&s;tanding the &s;e|veral
<PB N="4" REF="40">Promi&s;es of pre&s;ent as well as future Happi|ne&s;s made to the ju&s;t and upright Man in Scripture, and tho' Men perceive, that then they are the mo&s;t happy, when they act up to the Dictates of unbi|a&s;s'd Rea&s;on, and follow the Precepts laid down in the Go&s;pel; and tho' they have the &s;ure Word of GOD, that Piety will be finally rewarded in another World; yet, for all this, Men will for&s;ake the Paths of Wi&s;dom, who&s;e Ways are Ways of Plea&s;antne&s;s, and all her Paths are Peace, and pur|&s;ue, what is the very Rever&s;e of Godline&s;s and re|ligious Wi&s;dom, Folly and Irreligion. Were Men once induced to think, that Godline&s;s is great Gain; that it gives Health to the Body, and Mar|row to the Bones, and gives, what nothing in this Vale of Tears will afford, Peace and Tranquility of Mind; we might then expect in the moral World, what always obtains in the natural, Har|mony and an Uniformity of Action. But &s;ome, as if Piety tended to nothing but the Propagation of Mi&s;ery in the World, pur&s;ue what they think the mo&s;t con&s;ummate Happine&s;s, the deceitful Paths of &s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ure.

<P N="1"><PB N="7" REF="43">
1. THEN, I am to con&s;ider that Religion has a direct Tendency to promote our pre&s;ent Happi|ne&s;s in this Life.&mdash;As our Duty to GOD, our Neighbour, and our&s;elves, is comprehended under the Word RELIGION, I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew how our pre&s;ent Happine&s;s is promoted by a &s;trict Ob&s;ervance of each of the&s;e Duties.&mdash;And, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> with re&s;pect to GOD.</P>
<P>GOD is a Being from whom we have received e|very <HI>good</HI> and <HI>perfect</HI> Gift; in whom we live, and move, and have our Being. We are indebted to him for our Creation, Pre&s;ervation, and more par|ticularly for our Redemption. No Wonder then, con&s;idering the great Advantages we have received from him, that he has exacted from us Obedi|ence to his ju&s;t Commands: and that he might encourage us, his rebellious Creatures, who are more prone to Evil than Goodne&s;s, in the Way that leads to Eternal Life, he has &s;o blended our Duty with our Intere&s;t, that we cannot neglect the former without manife&s;tly lo&s;ing the latter. Wou'd we enjoy Riches, Honours, and the &s;eve|ral
<PB N="8" REF="44">Ble&s;&s;ings of Life? And wou'd we make our very Enemies to be at Peace with us? We have our Saviour's own Word for it, that if we &s;eek the Kingdom of God, and his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, all other Things &s;hall be added unto us: and if we return Good for Evil, and Benefits for Works of Malice, we thereby heap Coals of Fire upon our Enemy, and melt him into Kindne&s;s, Benevo|lence, Friend&s;hip. Wou'd we enjoy Contentment, Peace of Mind, and a Con&s;cience void of Offence, which is the only Happine&s;s in this State of Mi|&s;cry? If we honour GOD, and keep his Com|mandments, we &s;hall be content, and our Minds &s;erene, undi&s;turbed with bitter Reflections, and freed from the Gnawings of a troubled Con&s;cience. CONSCIENCE mu&s;t be a trouble&s;ome tormenting Companion to the Wicked, but unto the Godly it is Health, and the Bal&s;am of Life. When Storms ari&s;e, and Poverty comes upon the good Man, like an armed Man; when Friends, tho&s;e Beings of a Summer's Day, for&s;ake him in his Adver&s;ity, and leave his cooler Shade for the warmer Habita|tion of the Son of Fortune; or when Detraction
<PB N="9" REF="45">and Envy, tho&s;e malicious Attendants upon Good|ne&s;s, wou'd blacken the Reputation of the good Man; or when, in &s;hort, natural Evil, under Va|riety of Shapes, makes his Days uncomfortable, and his whole Life a Burthen; even in the&s;e Scenes of Horror, and &s;evere Hours of Trial, the good Man's Confidence is in the LORD his GOD, who is his pre&s;ent Help in Time of Trouble, and Rock of Salvation in the Day of Calamity. He con|&s;iders the&s;e light Afflictions as Marks of GOD'S Love and paternal Tenderne&s;s, inflicted not only upon Account of the many Failings he is by Na|ture liable to, but in order to awake the &s;leeping Sparks of Piety in him, which in the Day of Pro&s;perity are too apt to be nigh extingui&s;hed. DAVID thought it an Happine&s;s when he was af|flicted; for then he turned to GOD, and called his Ways to Remembrance. Thus he obtain'd, what &s;ome thoughtle&s;s Libertines at the &s;olemn Hour of Death would give the whole World to obtain, Peace of Mind, and a plea&s;ing Pro&s;pect of future Happine&s;s in the Man&s;ions of the JUST.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="46">GOD too, be&s;ides the Pro&s;pect of an eternal Weight of Glory, has anexed to our Duty of loving him, a &s;ecret, internal, intellectual Plea&s;ure. This Self-complacency every good Man enjoys; which makes him with the greater Steadine&s;s em|brace the one Thing needful. We are never bet|ter plea&s;ed than when we are grateful for Benefits received; we cannot help expre&s;&s;ing our Joy by the Serenity of our Countenances, and our in|ward Tranquility by our outward Demeanour and Expre&s;&s;ions of Thankfulne&s;s. If Gratitude be at|tended, as it certainly is, with &s;uch Plea&s;ure ra|ther to be conceived than expre&s;s'd, when 'tis performed towards our Fellow Creatures, what mu&s;t the Plea&s;ure be when GOD, our Creator, Pre&s;erver, and Redeemer, is the Object of our Gra|titude? Then for want of Words to &s;ignify the Greatne&s;s of the Favours conferred upon us, and to demon&s;trate our Incapacity to give GOD his due Prai&s;e, and proper Honour, we melt into an affectionate Tenderne&s;s, are ravi&s;hed with the &s;u|perabundant Goodne&s;s, and are lo&s;t in Thought and &s;ilent Wonder. This is a Joy the Good, the
<PB N="11" REF="47">religious FEW only know. The Wicked, that ei|ther deny GOD in Speculation, or forget him in Practice, are untter Strangers to this &s;till, per|manent, un&s;peakable Joy. Their Joy, like a DREAM, or the MORNING DEW, pa&s;&s;eth away, and is gone; and even the Recollection of &s;uch Joy re&s;embles oft too much the frightful Appear|ance in &s;ome Dream, which never occurs to the I|magination without Horror.</P>
<P>THE good Man's Happine&s;s is be&s;t illu&s;trated by drawing a Portrait of the wicked Man's Con|dition.</P>
<P>WERE Happine&s;s attainable &s;olely by Impiety, and were it proportionable to a Man's Proficiency in Wickedne&s;s, there would be then &s;ome Temp|tation to live without GOD, at lea&s;t without &s;up|po&s;ing a &s;uperintendant Being, in the World. But as Things are now con&s;tituted, it is our Intere&s;t to be pious. The wicked Man, notwith&s;tanding his Commi&s;&s;ion of Wickedne&s;s with Greedine&s;s, yet, in his more &s;erene Hours, when Con&s;cience is &s;uf|fered
<PB N="12" REF="48">to act the Judge, declares that he has no Plea&s;ure in Sen&s;uality. His Appetites are &s;trong, craving, re&s;tle&s;s. Indulgence &s;trengthens them; Enjoyment makes them craving; and continual Exerci&s;e upon unlawful Objects, makes them re&s;t|le&s;s, and never to be &s;atisfied. Plea&s;ure is gene|rally the Object of the Appetites; but Plea&s;ure, like QUICKSILVER, eludes our utmo&s;t Skill; and, grant it is obtained, what is it but rank Poi&s;on in our Veins? Moral is generally productive of natu|ral Evil. Gluttony produces a complicated Scene of Di&s;orders, Variety of Pain, Torture, Woe. The Drunkard takes his Gla&s;s with a quivering Hand. The la&s;civious Man is a living whited Se|pulchre, who&s;e inward Parts are one continued Scene of Mi&s;ery, Corruption, Rottenne&s;s; and, what is the mo&s;t lamentable of all, his Soul, be|cau&s;e of its intimate Union with the Body, con|tracts a greater Impurity. But &s;uppo&s;ing the wicked Man not intemperate and luxurious; yet, if he be covetous, he mu&s;t be perplex'd with ma|ny excruciating Thoughts, and his Body is gene|rally a fit Emblem of the Leanne&s;s of his Soul.
<PB N="13" REF="49">Care about what he at pre&s;ent enjoys, Fears of lo|&s;ing, Anxiety about increa&s;ing his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, cun|ning Contrivances how to over-reach the Unwary, and helli&s;h Schemes in order to grind the Face of the Poor, mu&s;t make the covetous Man, amid&s;t his Abundance, of all Men the mo&s;t mi&s;erable. When a Man is thus oppre&s;s'd with the Weight of world|ly Care, he has no Room for, or Reli&s;h of, what gives the greate&s;t Plea&s;ure to a rational Soul, the agreeable Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having pleas'd GOD. And what Plea&s;ure can &s;uch a Man take in ho|nouring GOD, who, in his Life, denies his very Be|ing? Is not he con&s;cious that. he has &s;et up the GOLDEN IDOL, and wor&s;hipped it in Oppo&s;i|tion to the true, the living GOD? And if &s;uch a one does pray to, and prai&s;e GOD; yet how can he expect a Ble&s;&s;ing, when he does not honour his Maker with his Sub&s;tance? Will not his Pray|ers be rather turned into Sin, &s;ince his Hypocri&s;y demon&s;trates his Mockery of that Being who is a jealous and a terrible GOD? Unhappy then mu&s;t be the Ca&s;e of this mi&s;erable Man, if he cannot for|get GOD in Thought as well as Practice: Recol|lection
<PB N="14" REF="50">mu&s;t be terrible; and Apprehen&s;ion of a future State, where all mu&s;t be rewarded accord|ing to their Works, e&s;pecially in Time of Sickne&s;s, or at the Hour of Death, mu&s;t be an agonizing Pain, and a &s;ort of Foreta&s;te of Mi&s;ery which the Damned only feel. In &s;uch a State GOD appears to him frowning, unmerciful, vindictive: This di&s;mal Notion naturally throws him into an A|mazement, Horror, De&s;pair; and he de&s;ires, what is in &s;uch a Situation, the ardent De&s;ire of the mo&s;t Abandoned, that he might live yet a little longer, and that he might at la&s;t die the Death of the Righteous, and that his latter End might be like his. But GOD, the good, the gracious, the merciful, who long bore with the repeated Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions of the wicked Man, in expectation that he would repent and amend, and con&s;ider at la&s;t what belonged to his Peace, now cuts him off in the Mid&s;t of his Sins, and leaves him to the di&s;|mal Apprehen&s;ion of approaching Judgment. If Men would really con&s;ider this melancholy State of the wicked Man, and that there is no Peace un|to him, either in Time or in Eternity; if they
<PB N="15" REF="51">would &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider the almo&s;t infinite Diffe|rence between a Life of Mi&s;ery and a Life of real Plea&s;ure, even in this State of Probation, they would no longer be tempted to Sin by their lawle&s;s Pa&s;&s;ions, or by the Agreeablene&s;s of any Object.</P>
<P>BUT unhappy for us it is, that we often re&s;i&s;t the good Motions of GOD'S ordinary Grace with|in us; are little attentive to the Voice of the Charmer, charm &s;he never &s;o wi&s;ely, and reject the common Means of Salvation which GOD has graciou&s;ly vouchafed us. And tho' all Things in the Creation are &s;erious, and perform the &s;everal Offices agreeable to their re&s;pective Natures; yet Man, endued with Rea&s;on, and for whom GOD died, as if he had no Returns of Gratitude to make for the many Favours received, either trifles away Life unthinkingly, or is lo&s;t between &s;inning and repenting; or follows, what is the De&s;truction of all &s;olid intellectual Plea&s;ure in this Life, the low Gratifications of Sen&s;e for a Sea&s;on. And cer|tainly that Man, who prefers the Body to the Soul, the mortal to the immortal part, little de&s;erves the
<PB N="16" REF="52">Rank he obtains among rational Beings. For we then &s;hew greate&s;t Signs of Rationality, when we an&s;wer the End of our Creation; and we then an|&s;wer the End of our Creation, when we perform a rational Wor&s;hip towards our be&s;t Benefactor, GOD ALMIGHTY; and we are then be&s;t plea|&s;ed with our&s;elves, and therefore be&s;t plea&s;ed with tho&s;e about us, when we &s;hew by our Words and Works that we are at Peace with GOD.</P>
<P>BESIDES, we then have the mo&s;t inten&s;e Plea|&s;ure when our Souls are the lea&s;t conver&s;ant with material Objects. The Body has been always reckoned a Clog to the Soul in her Operations; &s;he cannot think with her native Freedom, but is cramped in her Speculations, often lo&s;t in the Mi&s;ts of Error, whil&s;t human Science is the Object of her Contemplation. Yet notwith&s;tanding <HI>that,</HI> the Appearance of Truth, and the Solution of any Difficulty, delights the Soul with &s;uch a &s;en&s;ible Plea&s;ure, that &s;peculative Men think it an ample Reward for the Labour of the Brain: and &s;uch has been the Force of this rational Plea&s;ure, that
<PB N="17" REF="53">it has reclaimed the Libertine, and made him ne|glect the Beauty of the Body, for the never-fading Beauties of the Mind. If &s;uch be the Plea&s;ure, as it certainly is, when we deal in human Science, what mu&s;t be the Plea&s;ure ari&s;ing from the Know|ledge of our&s;elves, and a Contemplation of that Being from whom we receive every good and per|fect Gift. Who is there of &s;o harden'd a Nature, as to receive no grateful Sen&s;ations from the Con|&s;ideration of GOD'S Love in the Redemption of fallen Man? And is not this Plea&s;ure greatly aug|mented by the additional Con&s;ideration of our be|ing adopted thereby into the Number of the SONS of GOD? This is comfortable A&s;&s;i&s;tance under every Circum&s;tance of Life: When Storms ari&s;e, or when the Wicked triumph, or when Death, that King of Terrors, threatens to cut the Thread of Life, it is a pre&s;ent Help in Time of Trouble; and is to the good Man, what ORPHEUS'S Lyre is &s;aid to be to the Mi&s;erable in the infernal Re|gions, a &s;oothing Cordial in Calamity, and makes him almo&s;t forget, even in Torture and Mi&s;ery, that he is mi&s;erable.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="54">AS the loving and honouring GOD is attend|ed with &s;uch exqui&s;ite Plea&s;ure, &s;o likewi&s;e from the Performance of our Duty to our Neighbour, we receive Recompences of Plea&s;ure &s;uitable to our &s;everal Acts of Beneficence. <Q>As ye would that Men &s;hould do unto you, even do ye like|wi&s;e unto them,</Q> is the grand Go&s;pel-precept upon which hang all the Law and the Prophets. If Men would ob&s;erve &s;trictly this Behaviour to|wards one another, there would be no longer Wars and Bickerings among us; but rather, becau&s;e we expect Gentlene&s;s, Civility and Complai&s;ance, and honourable Behaviour from other Men, we ought to put on the &s;ame amiable Conduct, in order to gain, what may be wi&s;h'd for rather than expect|ed in the World, Peace and Unanimity of Senti|ments. A virtuous Conduct, however, tho' it does not always gain a &s;uitable Return, yet affords a &s;uitable Reward for the Performance of it. No Man does a virtuous Action without perceiving a &s;ecret Satisfaction in the doing of it: So that VIRTUE, in this Sen&s;e, it its own Reward in this Life, and has a direct Tendency to promote
<PB N="19" REF="55">our pre&s;ent as well as future Happine&s;s. But every Action that is attended with a mental Plea&s;ure may not be virtuous. Men that are &s;trongly affected at &s;eeing mi&s;erable Objects, are even forced, by their natural Make and Con&s;titution, to contribute to the Relief of &s;uch Mi&s;ery; and when they are relieving others, they at the &s;ame Time relieve them&s;elves of an Unea&s;ine&s;s, and con&s;equently do them&s;elves a Plea&s;ure. But as they do not give Relief to the Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, becau&s;e GOD has com|manded it, their Communication of &s;uch Relief is no Virtue, and therefore of no Moment in the Sight of GOD: And I am afraid, that &s;uch gi|ving of Alms, which is looked upon as a Cover|ing for a Multitude of Sins, but too often will only meet with its Reward here; and yet we may pronounce it a great Happine&s;s, that &s;ome rich Men are &s;o &s;oftly con&s;tituted by Nature, that they will perform an Action, in order to free them&s;elves from a pre&s;ent Unea&s;ine&s;s, when they would not have done it for the Sake of a Fellow-creature, or becau&s;e GOD has commanded it. To have a feeling Sen&s;e, however, of another's Mi&s;ery, is
<PB N="20" REF="56">reckon'd a happy Temperament of Body, which is generally productive of Benevolence; and Be|nevolence is an Incentive to Beneficence; and Be|neficence, if we do it not for the relieving our own Minds, or for the Sake of popular Applau&s;e, will lead us to Rivers of Plea&s;ure in a future State. Be&s;ides then the natural Plea&s;ure of doing a virtu|ous Action, the con&s;equent Satisfaction of having plea&s;ed GOD, is an additional Spur to moral Goodne&s;s. But if we will not be religious, or, in other Words, perform our Duty to GOD, or our Neighbour, becau&s;e of the Plea&s;ure attending them, yet, one would imagine, we would be du|tiful to our&s;elves.</P>
<P>AS the Practice of Virtue is the Health of the Soul, &s;o is it likewi&s;e the Health of the Body. Our Bodies are generally the mo&s;t freed from Pain when we conform to the Go&s;pel Rules. The MEEK &s;hall inherit the Earth; becau&s;e he is free from Pa&s;&s;ion and Violence, from Haughtine&s;s and Turbulency. The TEMPERATE in all Things is able to fight the good Fight, and to fini&s;h his
<PB N="21" REF="57">Cour&s;e with Joy; becau&s;e he keeps the Body in Subjection to the Mind: Whereas tho&s;e who are led by their Pa&s;&s;ions, are tormented both in Body and Mind. The ANGRY MAN is often di&s;tract|ed with Pains in the Head, Brea&s;t, Stomach: and no Wonder, &s;ince one Irregularity naturally pro|duces another; and &s;ince Anger is occa&s;ioned by an irregular Flow of Blood into the Head, it is no Wonder that Pain is con&s;equent upon &s;uch a Motion, becau&s;e a too great Di&s;ten&s;ion of the Ve&s;&s;els is naturally productive of Pain. The IN|TEMPERATE MAN too, for the &s;ame Rea&s;on, tho' ari&s;ing from different Cau&s;es, is mo&s;t torment|ed with Pain. The Top of his Head to the Sole of his Foot reminds him of his Luxury, Gluttony, Drunkenne&s;s. The ENVIOUS MAN, by his emaciated Body, gives us a demon&s;trative Proof of the Unea&s;ine&s;s he labours under: His Body is a &s;ufficient Emblem of the Weakne&s;s of his Mind; and when there is &s;uch a Connection and Sympa|thy between the Soul and Body, the one cannot &s;uffer without the other; and the Body then is
<PB N="22" REF="58">mo&s;t di&s;temper'd under a wounded Spirit: So true is the WISE MAN'S Ob&s;ervation, that ENVY is the <HI>Rottenne&s;s of the Bones.</HI></P>
<P>IF then we would be ju&s;t to our&s;elves we &s;hould practi&s;e the moral Virtues; if we will not do that for our Souls Health, let us at lea&s;t for the Ea&s;e of the Body. For every Man that indulges his Pa&s;&s;ions in any criminal Pur&s;uit, offends not only again&s;t GOD, Rea&s;on, or his own Soul, but like|wi&s;e again&s;t his own Body. A Violation of CHA|STITY is a Sin committed again&s;t the Body: and all other Vices, of whatever Complexion they be, or however they be coloured over by the &s;pecious Glo&s;&s;es of de&s;igning Men, are neverthele&s;s de&s;truc|tive to the Body as well as the Soul.</P>
<P>A GENERAL when he delivers a CASTLE to be defended by any inferior Officer, charges him to &s;tand firm to his Po&s;t, to repair the Breaches an Enemy has made, to &s;trengthen the old Fortifica|tions by new Works, to &s;tock him&s;elf with Arms
<PB N="23" REF="59">and Ammunition, Men and Money; and, after all, to u&s;e Diligence, Prudence, and Precaution, that he may not be attack'd by Surprize, or be betray|ed by the Cowardice or Treachery of his Garri|&s;on. THIS is the very Ca&s;e of MAN: GOD has a&s;&s;ign'd him a Po&s;t to defend again&s;t his Ad|ver&s;ary, the Devil; he is to arm him&s;elf with the Sword of the Spirit, the Brea&s;t-plate of Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, and the Helmet of Salvation; and after he has done all, to &s;tand, to be collected in him&s;elf, and to repair the Breaches Sin has made, and for|tify him&s;elf with good Re&s;olutions; that he may not be &s;urprized to injure his Body or Soul by the Beauty or Attraction of &s;urrounding Objects, by a deluding Imagination, or &s;trong Affections from within. If he thus performs his Duty to GOD, to his Neighbour and him&s;elf, he will re|ceive particular Satisfaction from the Practice of each of the&s;e Duties; and he will be inclined to think, that THAT RELIGION mu&s;t be divine, which has &s;o well blended our Duty with our In|tere&s;t, and has made our pre&s;ent Happine&s;s de|pend
<PB N="24" REF="60">upon our pre&s;ent Goodne&s;s; which was the SECOND Thing I propo&s;ed to treat of in this Di&s;cour&s;e; but I mu&s;t, with GOD'S Leave, omit it for another Opportunity.</P>

But if, on the contrary, we &s;hould have the good For|tune to meet with a Sy&s;tem of Laws every Way calculated to make us wi&s;e, ju&s;t, and good; and naturally contributing to the obtaining of That, which all Men pretend they are in Pur&s;uit of, pre|&s;ent Happine&s;s; we might then, with the greate&s;t Ju&s;tice, conclude, that the Author of them mu&s;t be an all-wi&s;e and good Being; who, be&s;t under|&s;tanding the &s;everal Relations we &s;tand in to one
<PB N="27" REF="63">another, knew how to draw us even by Violence, by the Cords of Love, and the Bond of Peace, to con&s;ult, what every Pretender to Rea&s;on ought to con&s;ult, his pre&s;ent as well as future Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>FOR this Rea&s;on, the Go&s;pel, con&s;idered mere|ly as a Sy&s;tem of Laws, ought to merit our At|tention, and may rea&s;onably claim a fair and can|did Examination from every rational Enquirer; who, tho' he regards a future State as a Chimera, would only be happy in this World; which, when compared to a more glorious Man&s;ion of the Ju&s;t, may be emphatically &s;tiled the very Shadow of Being.</P>
<P>AND if, upon a fair Examination, it &s;hall ap|pear that nothing is enjoined us in the &s;acred Ora|cles as a Duty, but what will, by the con&s;tant Exerci&s;e of it, make us happier, we &s;hall then be inexcu&s;able if we neglect &s;o great, and at the &s;ame Time, &s;o unmerited Salvation. For &s;uch it may be termed, if it has a natural Tendency to free us, from what is con&s;equent upon unre&s;trained Appe|tites,
<PB N="28" REF="64">a di&s;tempered Body; or from that greate&s;t of all Calamities, which can befal degenerate Man, a WOUNDED SPIRIT. That the Practice of re|ligious Wi&s;dom is attended with &s;uch a Freedom, the Experience of every good Man abundantly te&s;tifies; &s;o that if you will not believe an in&s;pired Writer, believe what any of you may experience, That GODLINESS is profitable unto all Things, having the Promi&s;e of the Life that NOW is, and of that which is to come. In a former Di&s;cour&s;e upon which Words, I propo&s;ed to con&s;ider the following Propo&s;itions:
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. THAT Religion has a direct Tendency to promote our pre&s;ent Happine&s;s in this Life.</ITEM>
<ITEM>AND II. That &s;uch a Religion, that has &s;uch a Tendency, carries an internal Evidence of its DIVINITY along with it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>AND therefore, III. It ought to be embraced, not only upon account of its Divinity, or fu|ture Rewards which it propo&s;es, but becau&s;e
<PB N="29" REF="65">our Happine&s;s, even in this Life, is con&s;ult|ed by it.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>THE fir&s;t of the&s;e Propo&s;itions I have already con&s;idered, by endeavouring to &s;hew, that GOD|LINESS, that is, Religion, con&s;i&s;ts in our Duty to GOD, our Neighbour, and our&s;elves; and that a con&s;tant Per&s;everance in Well-doing in the&s;e &s;e|veral Branches of our Duty, was the only Happi|ne&s;s which can in this Life be properly called &s;o, or ever be obtained. And as Religion produces &s;uch an happy Effect, we may ju&s;tly conclude, that its ORIGIN is DIVINE; which was the <HI>&s;econd</HI> Thing I propo&s;ed to con&s;ider.</P>
<P>IT has been the con&s;tant Ob&s;ervation of the un|prejudiced Part of Mankind, that ever gave them|&s;elves Liberty to think, that the Productions of Men always were attended with &s;ome Failures, which &s;ufficiently di&s;covered the Imperfections of their &s;everal Authors. Sy&s;tems of Laws, that were contrived for the Promotion of the Happi|ne&s;s of the particular Communities for which they
<PB N="30" REF="66">were made, not only di&s;covered the Corruption into which Men in general were fallen, but like|wi&s;e the Degeneracy of their Compilers. It would indeed be unnatural for us to expect that perfect Purity &s;hould flow from a corrupted Heart: for Intere&s;t, or Inclination, or both tho&s;e two great Enemies to Truth, too often hoodwink what &s;hould always, &s;uppo&s;ing the Want of Revelation, determine the Will, the rational Faculty. And that this &s;hould be the Ca&s;e with frail Humanity, that &s;ees but thro' a Gla&s;s darkly, and that too with the additional Di&s;advantages of having a den&s;e Medium to &s;ee thro', the Pa&s;&s;ions and Pre|judices, which divert the Rays of Truth from en|tering, in a proper Di&s;po&s;ition to inform the Un|der&s;tanding, it is no Wonder; &s;ince STREAMS that flow thro' MINERALS always contract the Qualities of the Bodies thro' which they run: And DOCTRINES, like STREAMS, can never flow pure, when either the Fountains or the Chan|nels, thro' which they are conveyed, are impure. It is ob&s;erved indeed, that, like WATER, (which, as it runs, refines) Men's Notions about moral
<PB N="31" REF="67">Good and Evil continually improved as they flow|ed down the Stream of Time from Father to Son: but notwith&s;tanding that, &s;ome Imperfection, &s;ome bad Principle, after all their Re&s;earches, di&s;covered it&s;elf to di&s;grace human Nature; and even their be&s;t Notions had little Weight in them, becau&s;e they wanted tho&s;e Sanctions, which every Rule of Action &s;hould be attended with, REWARDS and PUNISHMENTS.</P>
<P>THE CHRISTIAN SCHEME, or the Rule of Life delivered to us in the Go&s;pel, who&s;e End and Aim is the Perfection of our Natures, is in it&s;elf entirely perfect. It is to us, what the Tree of Knowledge was to our fir&s;t Parents, the Know|ledge of Good and Evil; but with this material memorable Difference: to them it was the Know|ledge of Variety of Pain, Mi&s;ery, Death; but to us it is not only the Tree of Knowledge, but of Life; whofe Root, tho' fix'd in Earth, yet lo&s;es its Top in Heaven; by the kindly A&s;&s;i&s;tance of who&s;e Branches, we may, tho' with Difficulty, a&s;cend to that happy Kingdom; where reigns uni|ver&s;al
<PB N="32" REF="68">Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and therefore univer&s;al Har|mony, the HEAVENLY JERUSALEM.</P>
<P>WHATEVER then has a direct Tendency to make us perfect, ju&s;t, and good, mu&s;t immedi|diately, if heartily practi&s;ed, make us happier; and the Contrivance of &s;uch Means mu&s;t be attributed to a good benevolent Being, who be&s;t under&s;tand|ing our Natures, knew be&s;t how to pre&s;cribe what was the mo&s;t productive of Happine&s;s. For this Rea&s;on, we may ju&s;tly imagine, that God gave us the Go&s;pel Di&s;pen&s;ation; which, both for the Ex|cellency of its Precepts, and Univer&s;ality of their Extent, can claim no other Original.</P>
<P>NO Religion in the World that was plann'd by mere Man, ever pre&s;crib'd univer&s;al Benevo|lence to Man. LOVE and CHARITY was on|ly to extend to Gue&s;ts, Friends, Citizens. To this confin'd, contracted Sphere, was Heathen Be|nevolence extended, till the Day-&s;pring from on high, the SUN of RIGHTEOUSNESS, &s;hone in their Hearts, and melted them into Tender|ne&s;s,
<PB N="33" REF="69">Compa&s;&s;ion, Benevolence. Hence their Hearts were enlarged, and in their Under&s;tandings there &s;prang up a LIGHT, which &s;oon di&s;pell'd the Mi&s;ts of Ignorance, and directed their wandering Steps thro' the Mazes of Error, to &s;omething more de&s;irable than all the Volumes of Vanity and empty Deceit in the World, THE GLORIOUS GOSPEL-COVENANT.</P>
<P>THE Benevolence which it propo&s;es is univer|&s;al. As CHRIST loved us, &s;o are we to love one another. As the Benefits of CHRIST'S Pa&s;|&s;ion diffu&s;ed it&s;elf thro' the whole rational Part of the Creation, &s;o is our Benevolence to be circum|&s;cribed by no particular Time, Place, or Per&s;on; but, like its GREAT AUTHOR, its Circumfe|rence is to be no where, and its Centre every where.</P>
<P>SUCH a Benevolence as this, which is entirely &s;uited to Man's Nature, and is nece&s;&s;arily produc|tive of his Happine&s;s, as it is attended with Com|plai&s;ance, Humility, Sincerity, Charity, Ho&s;pita|lity, and a Delight in plea&s;ing, and every other
<PB N="34" REF="70">laudable Perfection, mu&s;t take its Ri&s;e from DI|VINITY. For if we take a View only of the &s;e|veral Sects which deviate from the Go&s;pel-Purity, we &s;hall find them &s;o far from cultivating an uni|ver&s;al Benevolence, that they are ready to pronounce Damnation on tho&s;e that differ from them only in Sentiment, in Forms, Ceremonies, or any other Matters merely indifferent. But &s;uch &s;evere Judges ought to con&s;ider, that when they mingle their own contracted Notions with the Go&s;pel-Precepts, they not only di&s;honour GOD by &s;uch an unnatu|ral Compo&s;ition; but al&s;o, by a &s;our Moro&s;ene&s;s of Temper, de&s;troy that chearful benevolent Di&s;po|&s;ition, which is one grand Characteri&s;tick of every good Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>NO greater internal Evidence for the Divinity of the SACRED WRITINGS can be produced than BENEVOLENCE, which almo&s;t in every Page is taught; and not only taught, but enfor|ced by EXAMPLE. It &s;trikes at the Root of all the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions; which, for the De&s;truction they bring upon the Peace of all Society, are emphati|cally
<PB N="35" REF="71">&s;tiled the DISEASES of the MIND. Where it has rivetted it&s;elf into the Heart of Man, there is no ENVY becau&s;e a Neighbour is more pro|&s;perous; no HATRED for real or &s;uppo&s;ed In|juries; no REVENGE, becau&s;e 'tis referred to the Execution of that Being to whom alone Ven|geance belongs. It excludes ANGER, and all the Degrees of it, except it has for its Object that mo&s;t deform'd, and the mo&s;t pernicious of all Ob|jects, SIN. And it excludes, in &s;hort, all Sor|row, all godly Sorrow excepted; which extends it&s;elf, not only to a Man's own Failures in Duty, but likewi&s;e to the Infirmities, Vices, and unme|rited Misfortunes of others: But all repining and murmuring at the wi&s;e Di&s;pen&s;ation of Providence, and all &s;orrowing for Injuries and Di&s;appointments received from Men, are utterly unwarranted by this GOSPEL-BENEVOLENCE: for we are not only to wi&s;h, but to forward the Salvation of all Men, even of our mo&s;t inveterate Enemies; that they &s;eeing our good Works, may at la&s;t be re|&s;tored to the Paths of Peace, and be excited to a glorious Emulation, to glorify together with us
<PB N="36" REF="72">our Father which is in Heaven. And if we love GOD, and believe him endued with every po&s;&s;ible Perfection, we can never repine at his Proceed|ings; but whether he gives us Health or Sick|ne&s;s, Pro&s;perity or Adver&s;ity, we mu&s;t conclude it wi&s;e&s;t, ju&s;te&s;t, be&s;t.</P>
<P>AND as Benevolence keeps the Mind free from all hurtful Pa&s;&s;ions, &s;o does it likewi&s;e re|&s;train the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of it from every Thing bad in Practice. No Man can be unju&s;t, and, at the &s;ame Time, benevolent. For LOVE worketh no Ill to his Neighbour; and therefore nothing bad in Practice can be con&s;equent upon it. No Man that &s;incerely wi&s;hes his Neighbour's Welfare will defraud him, or &s;poil him of his Goods, will in|jure his Per&s;on, or endeavour to take away that, which is more precious than Life to every good Man, REPUTATION. No Man, in &s;hort, that has this benevolent Principle, will deal in Deceit, Cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s, Contention; but rather, becau&s;e he con&s;iders him&s;elf as a Member of this great Society, the World, and al&s;o as de&s;ign'd for a
<PB N="37" REF="73">more durable Man&s;ion in Heaven, he will practi&s;e every &s;ocial Virtue, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of which he may more effectually a&s;cend thither; where true Joys are only to be found.</P>
<P>THIS Principle, however good as it is in its Tendency, is but little practi&s;ed in the World; and it would be le&s;s &s;o, if GOD was not proved the Author of it: Mo&s;t Men are naturally &s;elfi&s;h, angry, revengeful: Few Men, even under the Go&s;pel, have a general Re&s;pect; but fewer have univer&s;al Benevolence for their Fellow-creatures. Men &s;hould re&s;pect one another, becau&s;e they are Partakers of the &s;ame common Natures; &s;hould love another, becau&s;e GOD is the Creator and Pre&s;erver of every Individual; and we &s;hould forward each other's Salvation, becau&s;e the Lamb of GOD conde&s;cended to empty him&s;elf of his Glory, and gave us a Life inimitable, both for its Benevolence, and al&s;o for the Beneficence exhibi|ted by it.</P>
<P>NOT &s;o unthinking Man: He, as if wi&s;er than
<PB N="38" REF="74">the GOD that made him, will not love his Friends, much le&s;s his Enemies: He returns Hatred too often for Good-will, and Ingratitude for Works of the greate&s;t Kindne&s;s. He can expo&s;e to Ri|dicule the Infirmities of Friends; and, in order to &s;hew his Malevolence, can, for the Diver&s;ion of his Acquaintance, murder their Reputation: He can &s;catter his Arrows, Firebrands, and Death; and yet he can have the Mode&s;ty to &s;ay, Am not I in &s;port? To &s;uch a one may be applicable that Ob&s;ervation in the Fable, "What is Sport to thee, is Death to me." Nay, to &s;uffer thus in Reputation is wor&s;e than Death: A natural Death is generally fini&s;hed in the Twinkling of an Eye; but a moral one, the Death of Reputation, con|tinues not only too often with Life, but likewi&s;e extends it&s;elf beyond the Grave. The horrid SPECTRE is too maliciou&s;ly conjur'd up not to excite PALENESS, the Attendant upon Fear, but BLUSHES in the innocent Faces of Po&s;te|rity. BETTER it is to be &s;ilent, than to be witty at the Expence of INNOCENCE; better
<PB N="39" REF="75">it is to be deemed a Man of narrow Thought, than to &s;hew by our much &s;peaking, that we think neither humbly of our&s;elves, nor candidly of our Neighbours: And there is no greater Ar|gument of a Fool, than a Multitude of bad Words incon&s;i&s;tent with common Hone&s;ty.</P>
<P>THE Nature of Man being thus prone to Deeds of Darkne&s;s, Ill-nature, and Defamation, What could be invented as a more proper Remedy for it than the GOSPEL BENEVOLENCE? And can it be imagined, that the Heart of Man would contrive &s;uch a Cure? Is it in the lea&s;t probable, that Man, who is by Nature SELFISH and RE|VENGEFUL, would him&s;elf make Laws which neither he nor the re&s;t of Mankind would follow? Or, would he enforce the&s;e Laws with proper Sanctions, when they contradicted the natural Bent of his Temper? And &s;uppo&s;ing that he &s;aw the Expediency of &s;uch Laws, Could he, for that Rea&s;on, imagine, that Men would follow them merely becau&s;e he pre&s;crib'd them? But would not a too great Fondne&s;s for SELF, Covetou&s;ne&s;s,
<PB N="40" REF="76">Pride, Envy, and fal&s;e Honour, prevent the en|acting of &s;uch &s;alutary Laws as we find inculcated in the Go&s;pel? Would Meekne&s;s, Forgivene&s;s of Injuries, and Humility, be pre&s;cribed as practi|cable, convenient, or commendable? Would Cha|rity, that great LAW OF KINDNESS, which comprehends almo&s;t all Virtues, be &s;o much as thought of, much le&s;s practi&s;ed, &s;uppo&s;ing that it had not de&s;cended with its great Author from Heaven? And &s;ince Men do not practi&s;e the&s;e Virtues commanded by GOD him&s;elf, Would they have thought them &s;uited to Man's Nature, if Man had pre&s;cribed them? The Truth is, Man is prone to Sin, and aver&s;e to Goodne&s;s; his Pa&s;&s;ions are &s;trong, and apparent Good is gene|nerally their Object. Hence ari&s;es the Neglect of Precepts every Way adapted to promote private as well as publick Happine&s;s. Hence Men act contrary to Conviction, and receive Doctrines for good, which they may intend indeed to pay a Regard to, but never do practi&s;e. But when Men are grown old in Sin, they would willingly carve out for them&s;elves Principles every Way
<PB N="41" REF="77">&s;uitable to their Practice. Hence Chri&s;tianity is rejected, and the Dictates of corrupted Rea&s;on, I &s;hould &s;ay Pa&s;&s;ion, are &s;ub&s;tituted in its Place. Hence is Corruption patroni&s;ed by the pretended Light of Nature; and univer&s;al Benevolence is lo&s;t in a low, &s;neaking, particular Selfi&s;hne&s;s. If Men were left to them&s;elves, and there was no e&s;tabli&s;hed Form of Wor&s;hip, we would &s;oon &s;ee what De&s;truction would be brought upon the Go&s;pel. Every one would adopt or reject Pre|cepts, as they &s;aw them agree, or di&s;agree, with their &s;everal Intere&s;ts: Every one would have their favourite Path to tread in, till, at la&s;t, they would leave no Remains of the Go&s;pel-Purity: A no &s;mall Argument this, that Man never con|trived the GOSPEL-SCHEME; for it is impo&s;|&s;ible that we &s;hould ever gather Grapes of Thorns, of Figs of Thi&s;tles, or that a corrupt Tree &s;hould ever bring forth good Fruit.</P>
<P>AS the Excellency then of the Go&s;pel-Precepts &s;ufficiently prove the Divinity of their Author, &s;o likewi&s;e does the Univer&s;ality of their Extent.
<PB N="42" REF="78">They are calculated, not as the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Di&s;pen&s;a|tion, for a peculiar People, but for the Benefit and Happine&s;s of every Nation under Heaven. All Laws that ever appeared before the Go&s;pel-Covenant, only extended to particular Communi|ties, only obliged tho&s;e for whom they were made, and &s;ome of them ought not to have been obliga|tory, becau&s;e they were di&s;agreeable to Rea&s;on, and con&s;equently were detrimental to Society: Whereas the Go&s;pel-Laws, becau&s;e the Happine&s;s of ALL Men is their con&s;tant Object, are, for that Rea&s;on, &s;uppo&s;ing their Divinity could not be proved, obligatory. For when Laws are, as all Laws &s;hould be, founded on Rea&s;on, no Man can reject them as unrea&s;onable; and therefore, tho&s;e who di&s;regard them, mu&s;t do Violence to their Rea&s;on, and con&s;equently are inexcu&s;able both in the Sight of GOD and Man. That the Go&s;pel contains a rea&s;onable Service, every one that has practi&s;ed the Rules comprehended therein can be&s;t tell. And if it appears that the Ob&s;ervance of them &s;hall make one Man as happy as this State is capable of, Why may not all Men be happy,
<PB N="43" REF="79">for the &s;ame Rea&s;on? And that all Men may be happy, by the con&s;tant and uniform Practice of the Go&s;pel-Rules, every Man's unbia&s;&s;ed Rea&s;on, as well as Experience, will inform him. And if it could be demon&s;trated, which indeed is impo&s;|&s;ible, that the&s;e Rules were not productive of univer&s;al Good, then there might be &s;ome Ex|cu&s;e pleaded for the not receiving of them. But as infinite Love for the Human Race was the great Motive for the Promulgation of the&s;e Rules, and as the Divine Love was the very Ba&s;is and Foun|dation of them, &s;o is LOVE &s;aid to be the ful|filling of the LAW; for no Man can be a Breaker of it that truly loves his GOD, his NEIGHBOUR, and HIMSELF: Happy would the People be, who are in &s;uch a Ca&s;e; yea, happy the People who fol|low the Rules pre&s;cribed by their GOD.</P>
<P>BUT it may be a&s;ked, if our LOVE and BE|NEVOLENCE mu&s;t be univer&s;al; mu&s;t we, for that Rea&s;on, offend no Man? Are we not com|manded to rebuke them that &s;in before all, and
<PB N="44" REF="80">yet are we not commanded to follow Peace with all Men? To this it may be an&s;wered, that if, by di&s;obliging and offending &s;ome Per&s;ons, we can do them the greater Good; if we can reform and &s;ave them; or, however, can promote the publick Happine&s;s, by di&s;turbing their Repo&s;e more than by leaving them in Tranquility, then it is that Con&s;iderations of Peace &s;o far cea&s;e, as they are incon&s;i&s;tent with Piety and Charity. For it is for the Good of Mankind that Vices, of what Complexion &s;oever, &s;hould be di&s;couraged. As they have an immediate Tendency to bring on the Ruin of Societies, Kingdoms, and even the De|&s;truction of the whole Earth; hence it is the Du|ty of every Chri&s;tian to endeavour at lea&s;t to op|po&s;e the Overflowing of Ungodline&s;s, that the Guilty might be reformed, and the Innocent not be hurried away in the mighty Torrent. If by re|buking the Sinner we can reclaim him from the Error of his Ways, we give the greate&s;t In&s;tance of Charity; and by &s;aving a Soul alive we cover a Multitude of Sins. If the SWEARER, BLAS|PHEMER, DRUNKARD, LIBERTINE, and
<PB N="45" REF="81">all the black Catalogue of Sinners enumerated by St PAUL, could be terrified into Goodne&s;s by har&s;h Expre&s;&s;ions; or, where tho&s;e gentler Me|thods fail, by &s;everer Treatment; would we not, in &s;o doing, perform a Deed of Charity, and con|tribute thereby to the Glory of GOD? To behave thus, indeed, in the&s;e our Days, when Gravity is thought Moro&s;ene&s;s, and Sanctity of Manners, Hypocri&s;y; when the infamous Mirth of the Son of Fortune is every where preferr'd to the Man of Sen&s;e; when, to pre&s;erve one's Integrity, one mu&s;t avoid the Conver&s;ation of mo&s;t Men; when Mode&s;ty, that great Guard of Virtue, is laugh'd out of Countenance; when the &s;mooth Tongue, lying Face, and corrupted Heart, are more va|lued than Simplicity, Sincerity, and a regular Tenor of good Actions; when the Lu&s;t of the Fle&s;h, the Lu&s;t of the Eye, and the Pride of Life, make Men either Infidels, or &s;omething wor&s;e than Infidels, carele&s;s Chri&s;tians: In &s;uch Times, to rebuke &s;uch Vices as the&s;e, requires a great deal of Goodne&s;s, an unwavering Re&s;olu|tion,
<PB N="46" REF="82">clear Courage, and a Zeal according to Knowledge.</P>
<P>BUT all the&s;e beforementioned Roots of Bitter|ne&s;s, that branch out with great Luxuriance from the Heart of Man, might ea&s;ily be check'd in their Growth, if Men would only try their Con|duct by the GOSPEL-RULES. The Pa&s;&s;ions that &s;well too high, and rage with direful Impe|tuo&s;ity, would &s;oon ebb, and &s;ink into a pro|found Calm, and be confin'd within their proper Channel. REASON then would a&s;&s;ume the gentler Sway, and be regulated by REVELA|TION; would conduct our &s;hatter'd Barks thro' the unavoidable Storms of Life, thro' Rocks and Quick&s;ands; which, becau&s;e latent, are the more dangerous, till they arrive &s;afe in the ETERNAL HAVEN where they would be.</P>
<P>IF we would be meek, patient, tender-hearted, &s;hewing Bowels of Mercies to all Men, what a plea&s;ant, &s;erene, peaceable State would the World enjoy? It would then be apt to tempt Men to
<PB N="47" REF="83">de&s;ire, what is the earne&s;t De&s;ire of all Men, not|with&s;tanding the &s;everal natural and moral Evils incident to human Nature, LENGTH OF DAYS and LONG LIFE. Men would not only be of one Mind in an Hou&s;e, but likewi&s;e univer&s;al Love would be the ruling Pa&s;&s;ion in the rational Part of the Creation: Hence Health and Peace of Mind, tho&s;e natural Attendants upon Goodne&s;s, would carry all Men with a compo&s;ed even Chear|fulne&s;s of Mind to the Man&s;ions of immortal Youth, where they will &s;hine as STARS in the FIRMAMENT. Such is the excellent Tendency of the GOSPEL-PRECEPTS, and &s;uch the Univer&s;ality of their Extent! Both of which &s;uf|ficiently evince the DIVINITY of their AU|THOR; who, by &s;uch Means, has largely con|tributed both to our pre&s;ent and future Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT, if we will not receive the Go&s;pel becau&s;e of its DIVINITY or future Rewards, let us at lea&s;t, for the Sake of making this gloomy State of Things tolerable to us, embrace it; which was the <HI>Third</HI> Thing I propo&s;ed to con&s;ider in this
<PB N="48" REF="84">Di&s;cour&s;e: But of THIS at another Opportu|nity.</P>

The Rea&s;on why they thus act &s;eems to be this: Real Happine&s;s, which indeed is not attainable in this Life, &s;eems to be the Expectation of mo&s;t Men, even in this tran|&s;itory
<PB N="50" REF="86">State of Things, where Joy and Sorrow, Hopes and Fears, Light and Shade, con&s;titute the Life of Man. The Imagination paints Things delu&s;ively, and in borrow'd Colours; it gives Solidity to Emptine&s;s, Beauty to Deformity, and Worth to Meanne&s;s, and has the Power of EGYPTIAN SUPERSTITION, it can tran&s;|form an APE into a GOD; but what is the more &s;urprizing, it pretends to realize NOTHING. No Wonder then, that Man, under &s;uch an er|roneous flattering Guide, mi&s;takes Mi&s;ery for Happine&s;s, and agonizing Pain for &s;olid perma|nent Plea&s;ure; no Wonder that Sen&s;uality is pre|fer'd to Temperance, and Confu&s;ion to the Love of Order; or that Mankind, rather than oppo&s;e the mighty Torrent of Affection, chu&s;es to &s;wim &s;moothly down the Current of Inclination. To contradict Pa&s;&s;ion, a Libertine thinks an arduous, unnatural, nay, an impo&s;&s;ible Ta&s;k. To follow Nature, which is nothing el&s;e but a criminal In|dulgence of every Sen&s;e, is with him an&s;wering the End of his Creation; not con&s;idering that the Beauty of Life, like the BEAUTY of a good
<PB N="51" REF="87">PICTURE, con&s;i&s;ts in a regular Harmony and Concert of all its Parts, and in a Conformity to the Rules of Rea&s;on. If every one was to follow the Propen&s;ities of his depraved Appetite, (for one Man has as much Right as another) we would not only, in all human Probability, &s;ee the Death of Morality, but the De&s;truction of the Sons of ADAM. Such has been, if the Hi&s;tory of all Ages may be credited, the di&s;mal Con&s;equence of a total Depravation of Manners; &s;o true is it, that RIGHTEOUSNESS exalteth a NATION, but SIN is the DESTRUCTION of any People. When Men throw a&s;ide the natural Di&s;tinction between Good and Evil, all Re&s;traints from Ill are con&s;e|quently broke; Vices then, of all Complexions, mu&s;t deluge the Earth like a mighty INUNDA|TION, and drown the very Seeds of Virtue. The Notion of a GOD likewi&s;e is then either lo&s;t or confus'd; his Providence, that by &s;ecret Springs directs the harmonious Motion of the Univer&s;e, is too often depreciated; except LIGHTENING, that terrible In&s;trument of Ven|geance, fla&s;hes Conviction to their Under&s;tandings,
<PB N="52" REF="88">or THUNDER, that dreadful Attendant upon the DEITY, awakens their &s;leepy Con&s;ciences, and forces them to own with Confu&s;ion of Face the Pre&s;ence of OMNIPOTENCE.</P>
<P>BUT the good, the religious Man, amid&s;t Lightenings, Thunder, Whirlwinds, and Earth|quakes, &s;its humble, re&s;ign'd, compos'd; he knows no Fear, but the FEAR of the AL|MIGHTY; who amid&s;t every Terror, is his &s;trong Tower, and Rock of Defence, a pre&s;ent Help in Time of Need. Is there any that would &s;ecure to him&s;elf a FRIEND? Let him be but good or religious, and he will have an ALMIGHTY FRIEND. Is any oppre&s;s'd with the Weight of SIN, and di&s;turb'd with the Gnawings of a trou|bled CONSCIENCE? There is an ADVOCATE with the FATHER, who graciou&s;ly invites all that labour, and are heavy laden, to come unto him, and he will give them REST. Is any &s;ick, or in ADVERSITY? Let him apply to that almighty and all-merciful PHYSICIAN, who rai&s;es the DEAD to LIFE, and the POOR out
<PB N="53" REF="89">of the DUST. Would any one enjoy LIFE, and &s;ee good DAYS, or inherit a BLESSING? Let him refrain his Tongue from Evil, and his Lips that they &s;peak no Guile; let him e&s;chew Evil, and do Good; let him &s;eek Peace, and en|&s;ue it: For the Eyes of the LORD are over the Righteous, and his Ears are open unto their Prayers: But the Face of the LORD is again&s;t them that do Evil. And who is it that will harm you, if ye be Followers of that which is Good? GOODNESS then is the nece&s;&s;ary Armour for every Man that would fight the good Fight, and procure to him&s;elf the Ble&s;&s;ings of Peace in this World, and a Crown of Glory in the next. For GOD will with-hold no Manner of Good from tho&s;e that &s;incerely love HIM. Thus GODLI|NESS has not only the PROMISE of the Life that <HI>now is,</HI> but al&s;o of that likewi&s;e <HI>which is to come.</HI> &mdash;In two former Di&s;cour&s;es upon which Words, I con&s;ider'd the&s;e two Propo&s;itions:</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> THAT RELIGION is the &s;ure&s;t Road to Happine&s;s in this Life: And that, <HI>Secondly,</HI>
<PB N="54" REF="90">becau&s;e it tends to make us happy, it proves its DIVINITY. The fir&s;t of the&s;e I endeavour'd to prove from the Happine&s;s that mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ult from the &s;trict Ob&s;ervance of tho&s;e relative Duties, of which Religion con&s;i&s;ts, to GOD, our Neighbour, and our&s;elves.</P>
<P>THE Truth of the &s;econd Propo&s;ition, I en|deavour'd to prove from the Excellency of the GOSPEL-PRECEPTS, which Man, as he is a Compound of great Ignorance, much Folly, and little Goodne&s;s, would never have invented; and al&s;o from the UNIVERSALITY of their EX|TENT, as they are excellently well calculated to promote univer&s;al Harmony, and therefore uni|ver&s;al Happine&s;s, among all the KINDREDS of the EARTH.</P>
<P>I COME now, as I propo&s;ed in the <HI>la&s;t</HI> Place, to con&s;ider our particular OBLIGATIONS to RELIGION, becau&s;e of its promoting our <HI>pre|&s;ent</HI> Intere&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="91">I AM not ignorant that it may be objected here, that temporal Motives to Obedience ought not to be &s;o much in&s;i&s;ted on; and that I ought rather to have painted the Joys of Heaven, or the Terrors of Hell, in order to invite or deter the Sinner from the Error of his Way.</P>
<P>TO this I an&s;wer, that Objects generally affect Men according to their Di&s;tance. The Pro&s;pect of pre&s;ent Gain in the Commerce between Man and Man, is u&s;ually attended with greater Plea|&s;ure, and con&s;equently pur&s;ued with greater Vi|gour, than the View of larger Advantages placed at a more remote Point of Light. The &s;ame holds with re&s;pect to Things temporal and eternal. The Things eternal not being pre&s;ent, and con&s;equently not expos'd to our View, do not affect us &s;o much as &s;en&s;ible Objects. If then Men can be per&s;uaded from the Enjoyment of the Plea&s;ures of Sin for the Sea&s;on they continue Pilgrims here, either be|cau&s;e they are &s;hameful, prejudicial to their Affairs, or de&s;tructive to the Body; ought not &s;uch Argu|ments, taken from Conveniency, be made U&s;e of
<PB N="56" REF="92">in order to invite Men from Sin? It mu&s;t be own'd, indeed, that if Men are virtuous upon no higher Motives, than becau&s;e Virtue is convenient, and productive of Health and pre&s;ent Happine&s;s; and if men are &s;eemingly religious, merely becau&s;e Re|ligion is the fa&s;hionable Convenience, in order to colour over &s;ini&s;ter De&s;igns, &s;uch Mens Virtue and Religion, with regard to another World, mu&s;t be vain: becau&s;e we ought to be virtuous and religi|ous not only upon account of a pre&s;ent Conveni|ence and Advantage, but likewi&s;e in obedience to GOD'S ju&s;t Commands.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, from whatever Motive Men prac|ti&s;e Virtue, whether out of O&s;tentation, and to gain popular Applau&s;e, as &s;ome; or becau&s;e it pro|motes the Health of the Body, and the grateful Peace and Indolency of Mind, as others; or, la&s;t|ly, which &s;hould always be the Ca&s;e, becau&s;e GOD has propo&s;ed Piety and Virtue as the Terms of Acceptance with him: From whatever of the&s;e Motives Men are virtuous, ju&s;t and good, both they them&s;elves and the World mu&s;t receive no
<PB N="57" REF="93">&s;mall Advantage from it: So true is it that VIR|TUE, even in this Scene of Things, which is di|ver&s;ified with Good and Ill, is its own REWARD, and that GODLINESS is great GAIN.</P>
<P>TO in&s;i&s;t upon the Practice of Virtue therefore, upon account of temporal Inducements, is not one of the lea&s;t Motives to behave well. Our SAVI|OUR him&s;elf, in the Sermon upon the Mount, in order to induce his Hearers to practi&s;e MEEK|NESS, MERCY, and the like, tells them, that not only a Reward in Rever&s;ion, but the INHERI|TANCE of the EARTH, will be con&s;equent upon the Practice of the&s;e Virtues.</P>
<P>EXPERIENCE too tells us, that many of little or no Religion practi&s;e &s;ome Virtues, if &s;uch a Practice, exclu&s;ive of the Will of GOD, may be term'd virtuous; becau&s;e &s;uch Virtues augment the Health of the Body, and increa&s;e thereby a thoughtle&s;s Indolence of Mind. Such will not live jovially and luxuriou&s;ly, becau&s;e Sickne&s;s is generally the Concomitant of Sen&s;uality. The
<PB N="58" REF="94">De&s;ire of continuing here, which to a good Man is not very de&s;irable, occa&s;ions a con&s;equent De|&s;ire of u&s;ing &s;uch Means as &s;eem be&s;t calculated for the promoting LENGTH of DAYS and LONG LIFE. And as Virtue has this happy Tendency, 'tis no Wonder if it be look'd upon as the one Thing needful to promote temporal Felicity, by tho&s;e, who have &s;hewn by their Lives, and more particularly by their Writings, that they are Advocates for no Religion. A great Argu|ment this, however, that Morality mu&s;t be very &s;erviceable to Societies; but the Practice of it mu&s;t be very precarious and uncertain, when the WILL, and con&s;equently the FEAR of GOD, are ex|cluded from &s;upporting of it. When the main Pillars, the Support of a Building, are taken away, Would it be &s;trange, if the Super&s;tructure &s;hould fall to the Ground? And, in like Manner, if the Will and Fear of GOD were not thought the Foundation of all moral Obligation, What an Inlet to all Manner of Licentiou&s;ne&s;s would there be? Every one then would be at Liberty to carve out for them&s;elves a Sy&s;tem of Morals, &s;uch
<PB N="59" REF="95">as Inclination, not Rea&s;on, would dictate; the Contrivance and Execution of which would put all HELL in TRIUMPH, and the ble&s;&s;ed bene|volent HOST of HEAVEN into MOURNING.</P>
<P>HAPPY, however, exceeding happy 'tis for the World that the Will of GOD is generally acknowledged as the Foundation, and the Fear of HIM, the kindly Remembrancer of all moral Ob|ligation. Few are &s;o very hardy, except the rich and powerful, as to deny, that GOD is the Author of all the Relations that &s;ub&s;i&s;t, and con&s;equently of the Duties ari&s;ing from the&s;e Relations: And therefore all our Obligations to the Performance of the&s;e Duties terminate at la&s;t in the Will of the Creator; who, by creating us, created all the&s;e Relations, from whence both our moral and reli|gious Obligations are immediately deriv'd.</P>
<P>OUR Obligations then to GODLINESS, which comprehends every Duty, ari&s;e
<LIST>
<ITEM>I FROM the Con&s;ideration of his having created us.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="60" REF="96">
AND II. From his providential Care over us, and continual Pre&s;ervation of us in Being.</ITEM>
<ITEM>AND III. From his having conde&s;cended to reveal his Will by his only begotten SON, who by his Death and Pa&s;&s;ion adopted us into the Number of the SONS of GOD.
<P>AND <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> Becau&s;e this Revelation contains nothing but what is both agreeable to REA|SON, and perfective of our NATURES.</P></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>THESE are the principal Obligations which we lie under to be PIOUS, JUST, and GOOD: Obligations &s;ufficient, one would imagine, to in|duce every rational Agent to love, and con&s;e|quently honour his Maker, not only with his Lips, but in his Life; not with Eye-Service, as Men-Plea&s;ers, but as Men profe&s;&s;ing them&s;elves Crea|tures of his Hands, and that con&s;ider the End of their Creation, the Means offer'd them in order that they might obtain Salvation, and the Voca|tion wherewith they are called. The&s;e Induce|ments
<PB N="61" REF="97">to GODLINESS are, or at lea&s;t ought to be, &s;o well known, that I &s;hall not make any fur|ther Ob&s;ervation upon them. And as I have prin|cipally in&s;i&s;ted upon temporal Obligations to Vir|tue in the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es, I &s;hall con&s;ider further, that we are obliged to practi&s;e Religion, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> be|cau&s;e 'tis ea&s;ier for us to be good and virtuous, than wicked and vicious; and, <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> becau&s;e a religious Practice gains us Reputation; and <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> becau&s;e a Ble&s;&s;ing will not only attend us if we hold fa&s;t our Integrity, but likewi&s;e de&s;cend upon our Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>THE <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of the&s;e Propo&s;itions is founded upon this Suppo&s;ition, that we are obliged to contribute to our pre&s;ent Satisfaction in this Life; which none will deny except Enthu&s;ia&s;ts, who make Religion, which is the greate&s;t Di&s;po&s;er to Chearfulne&s;s, con|&s;i&s;t in Moro&s;enfs, Gloomine&s;s, Melancholy. If this Po&s;ition the granted, as it certainly ought, that we &s;hould endeavour to obtain pre&s;ent Ea&s;e and Happine&s;s; it will hence follow, that Virtue ought to be embraced, and Vice avoided. For
<PB N="62" REF="98">whatever Method gives us more Trouble in the Performance, gives us le&s;s Satisfaction, and con|&s;equently more Trouble and Unea&s;ine&s;s. That the Practice of Vice produces this Effect, is evi|dent from Experience. When a Man is vicious, and at the &s;ame Time is de&s;irous of &s;aving Ap|pearances, in order to keep up his Credit in the World, every one may imagine that he mu&s;t be put to great Perplexities. The very Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of Guilt makes the guilty Per&s;on think, that the earne&s;t penetrating Look of another whom he meets, &s;uppo&s;es a Knowledge of his Crime; and if he finds that it is known, it gives him additional Vexation, and he endeavours to le&s;&s;en the Heinou&s;|ne&s;s of his own Mi&s;demeanours, by blackening the Reputation of tho&s;e who have thus ju&s;tly re|flected upon his Conduct. Thus one Vice is con|nected with another; and painful Reflections, the natural Re&s;ult of, and the nece&s;&s;ary Concomitant upon Vice, are, like JOB'S Comforters, mi&s;erable and unmerciful Tormenters of a wounded Con|&s;cience; which is but a &s;orry Recompence for the Lo&s;s of Virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="99">SUPPOSE too a Man is profu&s;e and lavi&s;h in his Expences, and at the &s;ame Time covetous, (for Contradictions often meet in the &s;ame Per&s;on) Will not the&s;e very Extravagancies make him un|ea&s;y? And will not the De&s;ire of &s;upplying them be an Augmentation of his Unhappine&s;s? Will he not, if he is not abandon'd, be afraid of a cen|&s;orious World? And if he is reduced at la&s;t to live upon the Genero&s;ity of Friends, who&s;e Pity and Relief would be cruel, becau&s;e attended with bitter Reflections upon his pa&s;t Conduct, Would he not, which is too often the Ca&s;e, chu&s;e Strang|ling rather than Life!</P>
<P>AND &s;uppo&s;ing that his Covetou&s;ne&s;s does keep him from lo&s;ing his ALL; yet Art in rai&s;ing of Money; low Cunning u&s;ed, in order to circum|vent the Unwary; Lies forged in order to gain Credit; and Promi&s;es to return what he is neither able nor willing to return; Fear of Creditors on one Hand, and of Poverty on the other; and in &s;hort, which he thinks the wor&s;t of his Ca&s;e, the Fear of lo&s;ing all Plea&s;ure, and plea&s;urable Mo|ments,
<PB N="64" REF="100">which he u&s;ually dedicated to Sen&s;uality, are Things that mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily create Flatne&s;s of Spirits, di&s;tracted Thoughts, and Weari&s;omne&s;s of Life, before he has learn'd, what every one in this State of Probation ought to learn, to LIVE.</P>
<P>MAN was never de&s;ign'd for &s;uch Mi&s;ery. GOD, in all his Di&s;pen&s;ations, de&s;ign'd him Hap|pine&s;s: and if Man will counteract the all-merciful De&s;igns of the mo&s;t benevolent Being, is GOD or Man to blame? Man &s;urely was not placed here mere|ly to &s;talk about, look about him, breathe the fre&s;h Air, and to perform other Offices in common with other Animals, or to propagate Mi&s;ery, Di&s;order, and Confu&s;ion in the World. He was placed here for wi&s;er and nobler Ends. The proper Bu&s;ine&s;s of Man is WAR. His Enemies are his own FLESH and the DEVIL. When an HOUSE is divided again&s;t it&s;elf, except great Prudence be u&s;ed, it mu&s;t FALL; and as the grand Adver|&s;ary the Devil acts un&s;een, and for that Rea&s;on is the more formidable, ought not greater Cir|cum&s;pection, Fore&s;ight, and Activity to be u&s;ed,
<PB N="65" REF="101">in order to prevent both temporal and eternal Mi&s;ery?</P>
<P>THE Prevention of both the&s;e the good Man has particularly in view. As he con&s;iders him&s;elf in a State of Warfare, he levies proper Forces to annoy his Enemies, arms him&s;elf with all the Chri&s;tian Graces and moral Virtues, with which he is not only enabled to make a brave Defence again&s;t, but to conquer his Enemy.</P>
<P>THIS is no Difficulty to a Man of Courage, who is re&s;olv'd, let others do what they will, that HE and HIS HOUSE will &s;erve the LORD. He knows that the Ways of Vice are perplex'd and intricate, and terminate in Sorrow; and that tho' GODLINESS &s;eems terrible to the Double|minded and Irre&s;olute, yet a determin'd Con|&s;tancy in the Practice of it, not only makes it ea&s;y, but de&s;irable, convenient, plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>WE find that Sloth and Idlene&s;s are the great Bars both to temporal and &s;piritual RICHES.
<PB N="66" REF="102">They make every little &s;eeming Difficulty a Bug|bear, a LION in the Way, tho' the Path will naturally bring a Man to pre&s;ent and future Emi|nence in Glory. <Q>SEEST thou a Man diligent in his Bu&s;ine&s;s? Such an one &s;hall &s;tand before KINGS, he &s;hall not &s;tand before mean Men. See&s;t thou a Man pious, ju&s;t and good? Such an one &s;hall not only live with ANGELS, but with the LIVING ALMIGHTY GOD.</Q> All which may be obtain'd at the ea&s;y Expence of bringing every inordinate Affection in Subjection to the GOSPEL of CHRIST.</P>
<P>EASY and rea&s;onable Terms as the&s;e are, they are reckon'd hard and unrea&s;onable by the indo|lent, carele&s;s, and &s;en&s;ual Part of Mankind. But &s;uppo&s;ing them difficult, which there is no occa|&s;ion to &s;uppo&s;e, a Man of true Courage and E|levation of Soul would attempt the Practice of them for that very Rea&s;on; and the Plea&s;ure that attends the conquering of a Difficulty would be a Motive &s;ufficient for the Attempt.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="103">HAPPY however it is, that no great Difficul|ties are to be met with in a Life of GODLINESS: All that are to be met with are of Men's own rai&s;ing; they &s;in, and when they find it trouble|&s;ome to per&s;i&s;t in it, they find it painful too to mea|&s;ure back the Steps which they have already run in SIN. Here is the great Pain; which is ea&s;ily prevented by keeping the Appetites under a con|tinued good Regulation, le&s;t they &s;hould conceive and bring forth SIN, and therefore Sorrow, An|xiety, Remor&s;e.</P>
<P>AS GODLINESS contributes to our pre&s;ent Satisfaction, by delivering us from, what is con&s;e|quent upon the Practice of Vice, natural Evil; &s;o likewi&s;e it e&s;tabli&s;hes a Man's Reputation, and makes him e&s;teem'd in Life.</P>
<P>AS Di&s;hone&s;ty brings a Man to Contempt, &s;o Integrity, and a firm Adherence to Truth, is the mo&s;t compendious Wi&s;dom; it creates Confidence in tho&s;e we have to deal with, &s;aves the Labour
<PB N="68" REF="104">of many Enquiries, and brings Things to an I&s;&s;ue in a few Words. Whereas Di&s;hone&s;ty is trouble|&s;ome, &s;ets a Man's Invention upon the Rack, and one Trick needs a great many more to make it good. 'Tis like building upon a fal&s;e Foundation; which continually &s;tands in need of Props to &s;hoar it up, and proves at la&s;t more chargeable, than to have rai&s;ed a &s;ub&s;tantial Building at fir&s;t upon a true and &s;olid Foundation: But Integrity is firm and &s;ub&s;tantial, and there is nothing hollow and un&s;ound in it; and, becau&s;e it is plain and open, it fears no Di&s;covery: it gains Strength by U&s;e, and the more and longer any Man practi&s;es it, the greater Service it does his Reputation, by encou|raging tho&s;e with whom he has to do, to repo&s;e the greate&s;t Tru&s;t and Confidence in him; which, in Affairs of Life, is an un&s;peakable Advantage.</P>
<P>WERE Men of di&s;hone&s;t Minds only acquaint|ed with the Advantages re&s;ulting from an upright Conduct, they would be hone&s;t, not out of any Love for Truth, but out of mere Knavery, that they might more effectually advance their &s;e|veral
<PB N="69" REF="105">Intere&s;ts. But divine Providence hath ju&s;t|ly hid this true&s;t Point of Wi&s;dom from their Eyes, that bad Men might not be upon a Level with the Upright, and &s;erve their wicked De&s;igns by ho|ne&s;t and lawful Means.</P>
<P>INDEED, if Men were only to continue here for a Day, and had no Pro&s;pect of a future State, there might be le&s;s Rea&s;on for the &s;ecuring of a good Reputation. But as Things are now con&s;ti|tuted, it behoves us particularly to have our CON|VERSATION hone&s;t in the Sight of all Men: Our E&s;teem among&s;t Men depends upon it; our Reputation is founded upon it; and, without it, neither a Ble&s;&s;ing will de&s;cend upon us, or our POSTERITY: Which was the la&s;t Thing I pro|po&s;ed to con&s;ider.</P>
<P>GOD, as if Self-Love was not &s;ufficient to make us ob&s;ervant of his Laws; and as if we were as careful of our Po&s;terity as our&s;elves, has, upon Condition of Obedience to his ju&s;t Com|mands, pronounced, not only upon us, but our

<P>AND if we look upon GOD'S Promi&s;es and Threats in no other Light than mere political In|ventions; yet we &s;hould, even in this Ca&s;e, pay &s;ome Deference to human Authority, by a &s;uitable Deportment, for the Contrivance of making the Community, and all the Members of it, HAPPY.

<P>AND &s;uppo&s;ing you have endeavour'd to pre|&s;erve your Integrity in every Circum&s;tance of Life, and have not fallen away in the Day of Tempta|tion; yet, notwith&s;tanding this Regularity of Con|duct, you have met with various Afflictions to di&s;compo&s;e both Body and Soul, and have re|ceiv'd, in&s;tead of a Ble&s;&s;ing, what you think a Cur&s;e. Before in the&s;e Proceedings you call GOD unju&s;t, con&s;ider, that the POTTER may deal with his CLAY as &s;eems proper to him, and expo&s;e it to what fiery Trial he plea&s;es, either with a View to try its Firmne&s;s, or to put it into a proper Temperament. Shall not GOD then have the &s;ame Power over his Creatures, as the POTTER has over his CLAY? Shall we receive GOOD at the Hand of GOD, and will we not be content
<PB N="73" REF="111">to receive EVIL al&s;o? Ob&s;erve the Characters of the faithful ABRAHAM and holy JOB: Did they in their &s;everal Trials repine, murmur, or charge GOD fooli&s;hly?

You &s;hould rather &s;hew, by your Re&s;ignation, your Obedience; and reflect that GOD, when he cha&s;|ti&s;es you, looks upon you as SONS, and not BASTARDS. Temporal Evil therefore is a Ble&s;|&s;ing, a kindly Monitor of our dependent State, and that we ought to look for a better Country, more durable, eternal in the HEAVENS.</P>
<P>AND let us always remember, that the LORD ordereth a good Man's going, and maketh his Way acceptable to him&s;elf. Tho' he fall, he &s;hall not be ca&s;t away; for the LORD upholdeth him with his HAND.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>LUKE xviii. 17.</HI></BIBL>
<HI>VERILY</HI> I &s;ay unto you, who&s;oever &s;hall not re|ceive the <HI>KINGDOM</HI> of <HI>GOD</HI> as a little <HI>CHILD,</HI> &s;hall in no wi&s;e enter therein.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>INNOCENCE is here look'd upon as the only proper Qualification for HEAVEN. As it con&s;i&s;ts in a Freedom from every Vice, little CHILDREN, for that Rea&s;on, may be ju&s;tly thought proper Emblems of it. Our SAVIOUR, in the Ver&s;e preceeding my Text, tells us expre&s;ly, that of &s;uch is the KINGDOM of GOD; becau&s;e they are lively Images and Examples of that good Temper and Di&s;po&s;ition,
<PB N="78" REF="115">by which alone Men can be fitted for the King|dom of Heaven. That Freedom from Pride, Covetou&s;ne&s;s, and worldly De&s;igns; from Preju|dice, evil Cu&s;toms, and Habits of Sin; that ea&s;y and teachable Di&s;po&s;ition of Mind; that Innocence, Plainne&s;s, and Simplicity of Heart, which appear in all the Actions of little CHILDREN, are the principal Qualifications which every one of us ought to endeavour to attain, if we would be wor|thy Members of CHRIST'S Church on EARTH, and Inheritors of his Kingdom in HEAVEN.</P>
<P>BUT it may be a&s;k'd here, How is it po&s;&s;ible that Men, who&s;e Minds mu&s;t almo&s;t nece&s;&s;arily, on account of their being conver&s;ant with material &s;en&s;ible Objects, contract a vitiated Bia&s;s towards the Things of this World, &s;hould ever continue in Di&s;po&s;itions and Inclinations as CHILDREN? And if they do not per&s;evere in the like Innocence with Children, Mu&s;t they be excluded HEAVEN?</P>
<P>IN An&s;wer to which it may be ob&s;erv'd, that GOD is not &s;uch a &s;evere Judge as to be extreme
<PB N="79" REF="116">in marking what is done ami&s;s by his Creatures; nor does he require an un&s;inning Obedience from us, becau&s;e we have &s;trong Propen&s;ities inciting us continually to the Commi&s;&s;ion of EVIL with GREEDINESS: And &s;uppo&s;ing, &s;ince we are thus fallible by Nature, that we do fall from our Integrity; yet GOD, who always receives tho&s;e into Favour that &s;incerely repent and amend, will forgive us likewi&s;e, if, after deviating from the Paths of Peace, we repent us of the Evil, and confirm that Repentance by a Life of Righteou&s;|ne&s;s. If our Intentions are always honourable, and our Actions &s;quare with our Intentions, we &s;hall not only as CHILDREN be fitted for the Kingdom of Heaven; but al&s;o as MEN endued with Rea&s;on, who have received, and acted ac|cording to, the &s;alutary Commands deliver'd to us in the GOSPEL.</P>
<P>MEN then may de&s;erve a higher Reward, in all Probability, than CHILDREN. Children can have only good Di&s;po&s;itions; but Men may have
<PB N="80" REF="117">not only good Di&s;po&s;itions, but likewi&s;e &s;omething better, con&s;equent upon them, GOOD ACTIONS. Children only think and act as they are taught, and therefore are not properly free Agents. Men, on the contrary, can think and judge for them|&s;elves; and if they are &s;incere in the Examination of every Thing that is propo&s;ed to their Under|&s;tandings, and con&s;equently act according to the Re&s;ult of &s;uch a previous Examination, they will, if they per&s;i&s;t in their Sincerity, be receiv'd final|ly as little CHILDREN into the KINGDOM of HEAVEN.</P>
<P>BUT it may be again ask'd, How is it po&s;|&s;ible for Men, who&s;e original Seeds of Corruption are &s;trengthen'd by living in a degenerate World, ever to be in Di&s;po&s;ition as Children? For, it may be well &s;uppo&s;ed, that there cannot be the &s;ame Innocence, where the original Bia&s;s to Ill is nece&s;|&s;arily augmented; and therefore Men cannot re|ceive, as a little Child, the Kingdom of Heaven.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="118">IN an&s;wer to which I &s;hall ob&s;erve, that, even in Di&s;po&s;ition, Men may be as innocent as Chil|dren. For even in them we find, too often, Pride, Anger, Malice, Revenge, and a covetous Di&s;po|&s;ition. But as the&s;e bad Pa&s;&s;ions do not properly proceed from their own Choice; and as their rea&s;oning Faculty is too weak to di&s;cern the Di|&s;tinction between moral Good and Evil; &s;o, if their &s;trong Propen&s;ities to Ill &s;hould &s;pring forth into Action, we would call &s;uch Actions, becau&s;e the Re&s;ult of Ignorance and want of Judgment, SINS of INFIRMITY; and con&s;equently would be excu&s;able, thro' the Merits of CHRIST, in the Sight of GOD. But it may be ob&s;erved at the &s;ame Time, that as the Minds of Children are mere Blanks, and are capable of being filled up with either good or bad Principles, &s;o tho&s;e, under who&s;e Care they are, whether Parents or Ma&s;ters, &s;hould do well to con&s;ider, that if they in&s;til bad Principles, either by Precept or Example, into the Minds of Children, they may perhaps in this, but they will a&s;&s;uredly in the next World, repent of &s;uch unchri&s;tian Behaviour. So true is it, that
<PB N="82" REF="119">our good or bad Conduct in Life depends chiefly upon the fir&s;t Impre&s;&s;ions given us in our Infancy, and whil&s;t our Rea&s;on affords us in&s;ufficient Light to guide our Steps thro' the Mazes of Error. But to return:</P>
<P>CHILDREN, as I before ob&s;erved, have their Propen&s;ities to Ill; and the&s;e Propen&s;ities often na|turally, but always when encouraged and indulged, bud forth into Action. If this be once granted, as Experience but too fatally proclaims that it ought, then it will by Con&s;equence follow, that Men may be in Di&s;po&s;ition as Children; and therefore may, as well as them, obtain eternal Salvation.</P>
<P>FOR why may not Men be indifferent, as in|different I mean as is con&s;i&s;tent with Religion, about the Concerns of this World? One may cer|tainly live in the World without any criminal Compliances to the bad Cu&s;toms and Practices in it; and, if Scripture may be credited, we may both be, if we are properly di&s;pos'd, conver&s;ant among MEN, and have likewi&s;e our CONVER|SATION
<PB N="83" REF="120">in HEAVEN. It does not follow, be|cau&s;e we may happen to fall into prophane Com|pany, that therefore we conform in a &s;imilar Be|haviour; but rather &s;uch Prophanene&s;s may rai&s;e our Abhorrence of &s;uch Vilene&s;s, and cau&s;e us to contemn the mean Practitioners of it: &s;o that we may live like NOAH amid&s;t an INUN|DATION of UNGODLINESS, and yet keep free from the general Infection, and have our Minds more enflam'd with Zeal for GOD and his Religion, and con&s;equently our Di&s;po&s;itions more heavenly. In order to encourage &s;uch a Di&s;po&s;ition in you I &s;hall con&s;ider,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. THE Rea&s;onablene&s;s, and,</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. THE Nece&s;&s;ity of it.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>THE Rea&s;onablene&s;s of having always a good Di&s;po&s;ition will appear, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> from the Advantage that it will bring our Neighbours and our&s;elves; <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> from its being our be&s;t Preparative to HOLINESS; and therefore, our be&s;t Pa&s;&s;port
<PB N="84" REF="121">thro' the everla&s;ting Doors of Heaven to the KING of GLORY.</P>
<P>THIS Di&s;po&s;ition which we meet with in Chil|dren mu&s;t be of great Advantage to Society, be|cau&s;e 'tis productive of neither bad De&s;igns, nor bad Practices. For Per&s;ons endued with it mu&s;t be free from Pride, and Covetou&s;ne&s;s; and con&s;e|quently mu&s;t have no ambitious or oppre&s;&s;ive Views; mu&s;t be full of Simplicity, Sincerity, and, what is rarely to be met with, PLAIN DEALING. For tho', as I &s;aid before, Children too often di&s;|cover the bad Pa&s;&s;ions predominant in them, yet the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions are generally excited by the Impru|dence, or rather impious Folly, of tho&s;e that at|tend them; which, by the Way, ought to be an awakening Con&s;ideration to all Parents to chu&s;e only &s;uch Attendants upon their Children as will cheri&s;h benevolent Affections, and check the lea&s;t Tendency to Vice. And Parents them&s;elves, that are by their Circum&s;tances obliged to have an im|mediate Eye over their Children, ought to &s;ow no Seeds in their Minds, but what will, by a pro|per
<PB N="85" REF="122">Encouragement, produce a glorious Harve&s;t of corre&s;ponding good Actions. And &s;uch Pa|rents as neglect this nece&s;&s;ary, as well as plea&s;ant Duty, are an&s;werable not only to GOD, and their own Con&s;cience, but to the Publick, for &s;uch carele&s;s, immoral, irreligious Behaviour. And it mu&s;t be a melancholy Con&s;ideration to tho&s;e Parents, who, either by Connivance, Prec|ept, or Example, have contributed to make their unhappy De&s;cendents only fit Compani|ons for the Devil; or to be, what is horrible to think of, the DEVIL'S PROXIES. But this, as the Minds of Children are &s;u&s;ceptible of any Impre&s;&s;ion, may be ea&s;ily prevented; &s;o true is the Ob&s;ervation, that if you train up a Child in the Way that he &s;hould go, when he is old he will not depart, except with great Difficulty, from it.</P>
<P>AND if Men &s;hould have &s;uch docible, &s;uch flexible Di&s;po&s;itions to Good, and were always determin'd to embrace or reject Things according to their Rea&s;onablene&s;s or Unrea&s;onablene&s;s, or ac|cording
<PB N="86" REF="123">to the pre&s;ent or con&s;equential Good or Ill attending them, we &s;hould enjoy no Litigiou&s;ne&s;s, Quarrels, or Oppre&s;&s;ion in Civil Life, and no Di&s;|putes about the Doctrines or Modes of Wor&s;hip of this or that particular Church; but we &s;hould be all of one Mind, and one FOLD, united under one SHEPHERD, the CAPTAIN of our Salva|tion, JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>THIS Union, however, tho' much de&s;ir'd by every good Chri&s;tian, can never be effected, as long as Men continue in their pre&s;ent un&s;ociable and unchri&s;tian Di&s;po&s;itions. Self-Intere&s;t, Preju|dice, and Bigotry, are the Hinges upon which the Affections of Mankind turn. Few we &s;ee &s;o bene|volent, or &s;o beneficent, as to perform an Action without a direct or indirect View of Advantage from the Per&s;on whom they thus deign to oblige. And &s;ome there are, who, notwith&s;tanding their many and great Obligations to the contrary, will not a&s;&s;i&s;t the indigent, for this inhuman and im|pious Rea&s;on, becau&s;e they are <HI>indigent.</HI> An un|happy Turn of Mind this! Unhappy did I &s;ay?
<PB N="87" REF="124">Nay, I may venture to call it <HI>helli&s;h,</HI> becau&s;e it naturally leads thither, where DESTRUCTION has no COVERING.</P>
<P>PREJUDICE too, whether in Things of either a political or religious Nature, has almo&s;t a nece&s;|&s;ary Tendency to di&s;unite Men both in Affection and Intere&s;t. For when they think that they have &s;eparate Intere&s;ts from one another, e&s;pecially in Ca&s;es of a Civil Nature, they immediately com|mence Ho&s;tilities, by fir&s;t envying one another, and then by throwing out Reflections, both moral and per&s;onal, (without any Regard either to De|cency, Ju&s;tice, or Truth, and much unbecoming common Sen&s;e, much le&s;s open Profe&s;&s;ors of Chri|&s;tianity) which are not &s;o much to the Di&s;credit of their Antagoni&s;ts as them&s;elves; who, becau&s;e of &s;uch an un&s;ociable and unchri&s;tian Behaviour, mu&s;t naturally be look'd upon, I think, in the Eye of impartial Rea&s;on, as the very Dregs and Refu&s;e of Mankind.</P>
<P>AND as Prejudice and Bigotry to a Party in
<PB N="88" REF="125">the political Life, hinder Harmony, and produce, what is hateful to every good and peaceable Di&s;po|&s;ition, FACTION; &s;o likewi&s;e in Religion, they give Ri&s;e to a mo&s;t unchri&s;tian Di&s;po&s;ition, which neither Rea&s;on nor Revelaion can ju&s;tify, a furious Spirit of PERSECUTION. This fiery Zeal, which cannot be according to Knowledge, becau&s;e the Spawn of Ignorance, implicit Faith, and &s;piritual Tyranny, Bigotry, and Super&s;tition, ex|tends to all tho&s;e who rightly differ from them in Matters of Faith and Practice; or, what ought to cau&s;e no Breach of Charity, in mere Ceremony. But &s;uch unrea&s;onable Bigots ought to con&s;ider, that if they want Charity, that Bond of Peace and Cement of Society, they cannot po&s;&s;ibly be fit for that Place, where all is Harmony, where all is Peace and Love, the KINGDOM of HEAVEN.</P>
<P>AND as long as Self-Intere&s;t, Prejudice, and Bigotry, are the Springs of Action in the human Soul, we may naturally expect, what will break the Chains that link Society together, Envy, Hatred, and inhuman Scenes of Di&s;order. But
<PB N="89" REF="126">the&s;e may be ea&s;ily prevented, by cheri&s;hing in our Minds only &s;uch Di&s;po&s;itions as will nece&s;&s;arily recommend us not only to the Favour of Men, but, what is infinitely better, to the Friend&s;hip of GOD. And GOD has requir'd &s;uch Di&s;po&s;itions to be exerted into actual Holine&s;s, that, by &s;uch Qualifications, we may be the better fitted for his KINGDOM.</P>
<P>BUT no Man can be holy without an holy Di&s;|po&s;ition. This mu&s;t be the nece&s;&s;ary Preparative to Purity in Action. We &s;hould deal with our Minds as we generally do with a GARDEN, where, before we &s;ow the good Seeds, we extract the Roots of every noxious Weed, le&s;t, by their growing up together with the u&s;eful Herbs, they &s;hould either choak them at their fir&s;t Ri&s;e, or hinder their growing up to Perfection. If we were to deal thus with our Minds, and endeavour to eradicate every latent Root of Bitterne&s;s, and che|ri&s;h every Seed of Virtue, and tran&s;plant from other Soils whatever would contribute to the Dignity and
<PB N="90" REF="127">true Ornament of the better Part of us, our SOULS, we &s;hould not only then have good Di&s;|po&s;itions, but tho&s;e Di&s;po&s;itions would be exerted into actual Holine&s;s. And as one good Di&s;po&s;ition produces another, &s;o does one Virtue naturally give Ri&s;e to many more, till all the Blank in the tender Mind is filled up with every Thing that is amiable, productive of its own Peace, and promotive of the Happine&s;s of the whole rational Part of the Crea|tion. But this is not often the Ca&s;e. TARES, that is, di&s;honourable Notions, are &s;uffer'd to grow up in the human Mind, and they are often che|ri&s;h'd by tho&s;e very Per&s;ons that ought to endea|vour to root them out. And this generally hap|pens with two &s;orts of Per&s;ons; to Per&s;ons born to opulent Fortunes, and to the Dregs of the People. When a Man is born to inherit Riches, he is too often induced to think, forming his Judgment from the Behaviour of tho&s;e about him, that RICHES are the only proper Foundation for HONOUR and ESTEEM. And this confirms him in Error, when he &s;ees Virtue, becau&s;e mean|ly clothed, and in tatter'd Robes, neglected, &s;light|ed,
<PB N="91" REF="128">affronted. Thus the HUMAN BLADDER is blown into an extravagant Tumor, &s;o that it con&s;equentially forgets the Relation between it and its Fellow-Creatures; and, what is wor&s;e, its Dependance upon that Being who gave it Exi&s;t|ence. Thus are wrong Principles taught by Ex|ample; and they are &s;uffered to take Root in young Minds the more ea&s;ily, becau&s;e the World gives a Sanction to them, by encouraging the Practice of them.</P>
<P>THE very lowe&s;t and illiterate Part of Man|kind too, as well as the rich and powerful, has but too commonly abandon'd Di&s;po&s;itions. Sneaking low Tricks, Deceit in every Shape, Impatience of Re&s;traint, Drunkenne&s;s, Oaths, Cur&s;es, Impre|cations, and a vile Propen&s;ity to follow the Com|mands of the Powerful and Opulent, notwith&s;tand|ing the Inju&s;tice of them, are &s;ufficient Proofs of the Badne&s;s of their Di&s;po&s;itions, and of their en|tire Contempt of all moral and religious Truths. No wonder then, that the unhappy De&s;cendants of &s;uch worthle&s;s Wretches inherit the &s;ame Di&s;|po&s;itions,
<PB N="92" REF="129">and practi&s;e the &s;ame Indecencies, &s;ince Children are &s;oone&s;t infected by Example, and are ea&s;ily induced to believe that they cannot do wrong if they tread in their Parents Steps; who, by their Age, ought to know, and who&s;e Intere&s;t it is, or at lea&s;t ought to be, to point out to them the Things that tend both to their pre&s;ent and everla&s;ting Peace. Thus are the DISEASES of the MIND, like tho&s;e of the BODY, propagated from one poluted Generation to another, till the Long-&s;uffering of GOD, being quite worn out in Expec|tation of their Amendment, they are entirely era|dicated by the Change of the Subject in which they exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>TO prevent which Di&s;ea&s;es of the Mind, and the Judgments of GOD, &s;ooner or later, con&s;e|quent thereupon, we may naturally infer, what I propo&s;ed to con&s;ider in the <HI>&s;econd</HI> Place, the ab|&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of having our Di&s;po&s;itions as CHILDREN.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="130">I OBSERV'D before the bad Effects which evil Di&s;po&s;itions naturally produce, both in the religious and civil Life: I &s;hall therefore &s;hew, under this Head, that if we do not take Care that the Di&s;po&s;itions of our Hearts be good, we mu&s;t of con&s;equence fail of pre&s;ent and future Happi|ne&s;s. For when the Inclinations and Di&s;po&s;itions of the Heart are bent towards Evil continually, there can be no Ea&s;e, and therefore no Happine&s;s. REASON, which &s;hould be the governing Prin|ciple of the SOUL, and direct the Affections to their proper Objects, no longer pre&s;ides at the HELM, but is forced to give way to that De|&s;troyer of the HUMAN BARK, the RULING PASSION. When Affection is thus &s;uffered to reign in the Heart of Man, the Mind is blind both to private and publick Intere&s;t; no Per&s;ua&s;ion can remove the Darkne&s;s with which it is involv'd, and no In&s;truction can enlighten it; and thus 'tis hurried down, if the Grace of GOD interpo&s;e not, by the violent STREAM of INCLINATION, into the terrible OCEAN of INEXTINGUISHABLE FLAME.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="131">TO avoid which di&s;mal Unhappine&s;s, 'tis in|cumbent upon every one of us to keep our Hearts with all Diligence; becau&s;e out of them are the ISSUES of LIFE or DEATH: For if we do not keep our Hearts pure, nor keep a con&s;tant Guard over them, evil Inclinations will &s;pring up, and &s;urrounding Objects will add Life and Vigour to them, till they grow too luxuriant to be con|troul'd. Thus they will influence both our Belief and Practice. Truth, tho' &s;hining in her origi|nal Brightne&s;s, cannot gain Admittance into our Hearts when the Mi&s;ts of Pa&s;&s;ion are &s;o dark and ob&s;cure. For Truth, GOSPEL-TRUTH e&s;pe|cially, is of too pure a Nature for a corrupted Heart. All the evil Di&s;po&s;itions latent in it im|mediately declare War, and put them&s;elves in a Po&s;ture of Defence again&s;t GOD and Goodne&s;s, and again&s;t every Thing that has the lea&s;t Ten|dency to root them out. It is therefore owing to the evil Di&s;po&s;itions and Inclinations of the Heart, and not to Principle, that we have Infidels among&s;t us. Such, indeed, when the Affections
<PB N="95" REF="132">are heated, may own no GOD but BACCHUS, and pay no Devotions to any but him and VENUS; but when Jollity cea&s;es, and the Mind is at Lei|&s;ure for Reflection; or when THUNDER and LIGHTENING proclaim the avenging JEHO|VAH; the&s;e Infidels not only in &s;uch Circum|&s;tances own a GOD, but likewi&s;e condemn the bad Di&s;po&s;itions of their Hearts, and the vicious Actions con&s;equent thereupon, and would be glad if the Merits of their de&s;pis'd Redeemer could &s;ave them from impending Ruin.</P>
<P>BUT that our Ca&s;e may not be &s;uch, and that we may not fail of attaining an eternal Weight of Glory, 'tis incumbent upon us to keep a &s;trict Guard over our Hearts, becau&s;e they are allowed to be deceitful above all Things. For we naturally, if we have been once deceived, beware of having any Intercour&s;e with the DECEIVER for the fu|ture: And we generally &s;earch that Place dili|gently that formerly has conceal'd a THIEF, that would, if not timely prevented, have depriv'd us of
<PB N="96" REF="133">that, which, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, makes Life com|fortable, MONEY. If &s;uch Care, Caution, and Circum&s;pection is requi&s;ite, with regard to Things temporal; certainly, when an Eternity of inexpre&s;|&s;ible Happine&s;s is at Stake, and when the Attain|ment of it depends upon our good Behaviour, we &s;hould let no corrupt Inclination prevail over our Rea&s;on, and deprive us of that, which the gaining of this pre&s;ent World can by no Means counter|balance, ETERNAL GLORY.</P>
<P>AND to this guarding of our Hearts from all IMPURE AFFECTIONS, let us add Prayers to GOD, that he would enable us by his HOLY SPIRIT, not only to be pure in WILL, but likewi&s;e in DEED; that thereby, as LITTLE CHILDREN, we may be receiv'd into the KING|DOM of HEAVEN. For without &s;uch Holine&s;s no Man &s;hall &s;ee the LORD.</P>
<P>WHOM, that all of us may be thus qualified to &s;ee, may GOD of his infinite Mercy grant, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>TO &s;hew a becoming Gratitude for Fa|vours received, is a Duty ju&s;tly ex|pected between Man and Man. A Favour conferr'd &s;uppo&s;es a Debt to the Per&s;on that conferr'd it; and where there is a Debt, there is an Obligation to the Payment of it when Op|portunity
<PB N="100" REF="136">offers. To the Performance of this every Man is obliged, tho' human Laws &s;ometimes cannot enforce it. The Law of Nature loudly proclaims, and Religion &s;ugge&s;ts to us, that it is an Argument of a mean ungenerous Spirit, to be forgetful of Benefits.</P>
<P>IF Gratitude be allowed to be a Duty, as it cer|tainly is, between Man and Man, the Obligation to the Practice of it is greater both according to the Nature, and likewi&s;e in relation to the Be&s;tower of it. When Man gives, he does not often con&s;i|der either the Goodne&s;s of the Thing he gives, or the Worthine&s;s of the Object upon whom he con|fers it. O&s;tentation too often gives Ri&s;e to his Large&s;&s;es, and Fancy, not Judgment, directs him in the Choice of a Favourite. Hence, it often happens, that many are made INSTRUCTORS of the Ignorant, before they have learnt what ought principally to be regarded, the primary Intention of their Office. Hence, &s;ome are made INTER|PRETERS of the LAWS, who&s;e &s;ole Aim &s;eems to be nothing more than to &s;ink tho&s;e, whom
<PB N="101" REF="137">they ought to rai&s;e, into the greate&s;t Poverty. Hence, others &s;it in the JUDGMENT-SEAT, who have neither Patience, Abilities, nor Inte|grity, to be proper Di&s;pen&s;ers of Rewards and Puni&s;hments; and it may be laid down as a Maxim, that tho&s;e that are unju&s;t to them&s;elves with regard to their true Intere&s;t, can never be inflexibly ju&s;t to others.</P>
<P>MEN then, you &s;ee, have Offices often a&s;&s;ign'd them for which they are either naturally or morally unfit. And that this &s;hould be the Ca&s;e, why &s;hould we wonder, &s;ince Intere&s;t, Prejudice Hu|mour and Caprice, are generally the chief Mana|gers of the Affections. And &s;ince Man is guided by &s;uch uncertain fallible Directors, it would be an Impropriety to expect Favours and Benefits always properly conferr'd either upon the WISE or FOOLISH.</P>
<P>NOT &s;o the all-wi&s;e Governor of the Univer&s;e. He both &s;ees, and gives us, what is fitte&s;t for us in every Circum&s;tance of Life. He maketh Rain to
<PB N="102" REF="138">de&s;cend upon the ju&s;t and unju&s;t, and gives to both, by his ordinary Providence, fruitful Sea&s;ons; but he re&s;erves in the mean time more particular Ble&s;&s;ings for tho&s;e that diligently &s;eek him. He, no Doubt, gives Poverty to tho&s;e who in Pro&s;pe|rity might &s;et up their HORN and a &s;tiff NECK, and by that Means both forget them&s;elves and their GOD. And &s;ometimes too he permits the Wicked to go on pro&s;perou&s;ly, and their Affairs to run on in an ea&s;y &s;mooth Cour&s;e, till he &s;ees them ripe for De&s;truction; and then he tumbles them down from their improper Eminence, not only for their own Puni&s;hment, but to be &s;tanding Monuments of his ju&s;t Dealing towards ungodly Men. When a Nation has in a great Mea&s;ure for&s;aken the Alle|giance it owes to that Being to whom it is indebted for being a Nation; when it is grown proud, am|bitious, luxurious, and executeth not true Judg|ment; when Pomp, Wealth, and Titles, entirely engro&s;s the Attention of the Inhabitants; when Vice appears upon the Stage of Life, not only countenanced, but encouraged; when private Vices have been inculcated as publick Benefits; when
<PB N="103" REF="139">Laws, which were enacted for the Prohibition of Intemperance, are repealed for the &s;ake of rai&s;ing Money to the Government; when Magi&s;trates, who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s it is to &s;ee Laws put in Execution, are carele&s;s, and are afraid to offend a vicious Neighbour; is it &s;trange, when &s;uch Things as THESE are permitted and encouraged in a Na|tion, that GOD &s;hould puni&s;h &s;uch a KINGDOM as this?</P>
<P>NO Wonder then, that War, Blood&s;hed, and Death, &s;hould be con&s;equent upon &s;uch a Scene of Di&s;order, Corruption, and every evil Work. No Wonder that Sickne&s;s walks in Darkne&s;s, or that Fevers de&s;troy at Noon-day. When a Nation is almo&s;t totally corrupted, a de&s;perate Remedy is required to bring it to a proper Sen&s;e of its Duty; and &s;uch is the heinous Nature of Ingratitude for the innumerable Ble&s;&s;ings of Life &s;howered down upon us by Providence, that it naturally kindles the Sparks of the DIVINE WRATH again&s;t us; and it is no Wonder if then we are vi&s;ited with SCOURGES and with a ROD of IRON. Had
<PB N="104" REF="140">we in the Times of Peace walked humbly with our GOD, and been properly grateful for the Ble&s;&s;ings of PEACE; had we, in&s;tead of Luxury, practi&s;ed Frugality, in&s;tead of either, an entire Neglect of, or an indolent di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate Care|le&s;&s;ne&s;s in Relgion; had we been &s;incere and re|&s;olute in the Wor&s;hip of the true GOD, he would not, in all Probability, have permitted civil Di&s;|cord to have raged horribly among&s;t us; or, if he did, would not have &s;eemed to LAUGH at our CALAMITY, or to have MOCKED when our FEAR came; when our Fear came from the NORTH as a DESOLATION, and our DE|STUCTION was approaching as a WHIRL|WIND.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING, however, our no|torious and repeated TRANSGRESSIONS, he has at la&s;t turn'd away his fiery INDIGNATION, and in the Mid&s;t of JUDGMENT remembred Mercy. Becau&s;e he has thus delivered us from our ENEMIES, and has lifted us up above tho&s;e that ro&s;e up again&s;t us, becau&s;e he delivered us
<PB N="105" REF="141">from the VIOLENT MAN: Therefore will we give THANKS unto THEE, O LORD, among the HEATHEN, and &s;ing PRAISES unto thy NAME.</P>
<P>DAVID u&s;ed the&s;e Words in order to &s;hew his Gratitude for his Deliverance from the unju&s;t Per&s;ecutions of SAUL, who is here exhibited to us under the Character of the VIOLENT MAN; and as we of this Nation have &s;uffered the like In|ju&s;tice from the Violent, I &s;hall &s;hew,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. THAT it is incumbent upon us to be grateful for the DELIVERANCE from VIOLENCE: And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. THAT our GRATITUDE &s;hould ri&s;e in proportion to our Deliverance: And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. THAT the be&s;t Return we can make for &s;uch mighty Deliverances, is a RELIGIOUS, LIFE.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>FIRST then, I am to &s;hew, that it is incum|bent
<PB N="106" REF="142">upon us to be grateful for &s;uch a DELIVE|RANCE from VIOLENCE; our Obligations to which will be&s;t appear from the Con&s;ideration of a &s;uperintending PROVIDENCE over us, and con&s;equently from the Notion of our Dependance upon Providence. If it be once admitted, that we are GOD'S Workman&s;hip, and that we owe not our Exi&s;tence to that imaginary Being, CHANCE, we mu&s;t in con&s;equence of &s;uch an Admi&s;&s;ion deduce the CREATOR'S Providential Care over us: For it is ab&s;urd to imagine, that a good Being would give Exi&s;tence to his Creatures, and would not at the &s;ame Time con&s;ult their Well-being. The &s;ame Goodne&s;s that prompted him to <HI>create,</HI> prompted him likewi&s;e to <HI>pre&s;erve</HI> what he created. We &s;ee the whole animal Cre|ation anxiou&s;ly &s;triving to &s;upport and protect their Young: Shall Animals of confin'd contracted Sen&s;e endeavour to pre&s;erve their Species, and &s;hall not the CREATOR of all Things have the &s;ame Providential Care over his Creatures? As he has created, &s;o will he feed the FOWLS of the AIR; and as he has not only given Exi&s;t|ence
<PB N="107" REF="143">to the FLOWERS of the FIELD, but like|wi&s;e has made them appear more &s;plendid than SOLOMON in all his Glory; &s;hall He not, becau&s;e ye are much better than they, provide for you, O ye of little Faith?</P>
<P>REASON then, not only proclaims a PROVI|DENCE, but a <HI>watchful</HI> one too. <Q>It is about our PATH, and about our BED, and &s;pieth out all our WAYS; if we a&s;cend into HEA|VEN, it is <HI>there,</HI> or if we de&s;cend into the ne|thermo&s;t Parts of the EARTH, it is <HI>there</HI> al&s;o.</Q> When Violence and Oppre&s;&s;ion lay wa&s;te a Na|tion, Is it not probable, that Providence directs the Storm of War, and permits it to rage furiou&s;ly, in order to humble the SINNER, and make him <HI>repent</HI> and <HI>live?</HI> This, no Doubt, has often been the In&s;trument of Vengeance in the Hand of GOD; and the Finger of Omnipotence never appears more eminently con&s;picuous than in Times of Sedition, Tumult, War. Have we not &s;een lately a victo|rious ENEMY loitering like the OLD CARTHA|GENIAN, as if infatuated, when, in all human
<PB N="108" REF="144">Probability, it might have &s;eized the CAPITAL? Have we not &s;een even our own TROOPS, who before had braved Danger with the utmo&s;t Intre|pidity, fly when there was no great Occa&s;ion for Fear, and &s;eek for Shelter when no Enemy pur|&s;ued? And have we not &s;een the Enemy &s;u&s;pend their Pur&s;uit, when, by pur&s;uing, they might, in all human Judgment, entirely have de&s;troy'd our Army? Such Behaviour as this, &s;o contrary to true Policy, &s;o directly cla&s;hing with their true Intere&s;t, &s;eems to point out the interpo&s;ing Hand of Providence; who confounds the mo&s;t deep-laid Schemes of de&s;igning Men, in order to vindicate his Glory, and to give evident Demon&s;tration, that the RACE is not to the &s;wift, nor the BATTLE to the &s;trong; that no Arm of FLESH might boa&s;t and &s;ay, that "with my own RIGHT-HAND have I got my&s;elf the VICTORY.</P>
<P>WHEN Providence thus vi&s;ibly appears in the Defence of a Nation, and has made the crafty violent Man fall into the PIT which he had made for others; when it has made the STORMS of
<PB N="109" REF="145">WAR a CALM, &s;o that the WAVES thereof are STILL, Ought not the People, that have thus the Ble&s;&s;ings of Peace conferr'd upon them, to give the greate&s;t Tokens of Thankfulne&s;s? If we own a Providence, as every Man in his Sen&s;es mu&s;t, Gratitude is due to it for its ordinary Care over us; but when it more evidently affords us its Pro|tection from the violent Man, when he had brought De&s;olation upon our Country. Is it not high Time to be grateful? APAGAN, directed only by the Light of Nature, could, for his Deliverance, &s;lay whole HECATOMBS of Animals, in order to &s;hew Gratitude to his GODS. Shall a PAGAN part with a large Portion of his Sub&s;tance, in order to appea&s;e his fal&s;e GODS? And &s;hall not he, who is a&s;&s;uredly the TRUE GOD and our Protector, and who has done great Things for us already, receive from us the &s;mall Tribute of PRAISE and THANKSGIVING?</P>
<P>MANY, too many, I am afraid, if one may be allowed to form an E&s;timate of their Behaviour towards GOD, from their Conduct towards their
<PB N="110" REF="146">Fellow-Creatures, would be glad to receive Fa|vours at the Hand of GOD ALMIGHTY, but would be ready to give no Acknowledgment for the Reception of them. They &s;eem rather to re|ceive them as a DEBT, and as if GOD AL|MIGHTY was obliged to &s;hower down his Mer|cies upon his Creatures, let their Behaviour to|wards him be what it will. In Time of Calamity, indeed, they can &s;hew all the di&s;mal Symptoms of Sorrow; &s;uch as the &s;oft Gate, the gha&s;tly melan|cholly A&s;pect, Eyes drowned in Tears, and now and then directed towards Heaven, deep Sighs, &s;olemn Groans, mournful Plaints, with the addi|tional frequent Invocation of, <Q>LORD, have MERCY on us!</Q> But when the Thunder that &s;eemed to threaten their De&s;truction has &s;pent it|&s;elf, and the Storm is entirely blown over; and when, by the Serenity of the Heavens, it appears that all Apprehen&s;ion of Danger is pa&s;t; the GOD that pre&s;erved them in &s;uch Danger, that rides in the WHIRLWIND, and directs the STORM, is immediately forgot; they remember not his Works, nor &s;ing his Prai&s;e; but, like true SONS
<PB N="111" REF="147">of BELIAL, they &s;hew their Gratitude by their Drunkenne&s;s, and their Thankfulne&s;s by their loud Hymns to BACCHUS.</P>
<P>THESE Things ought not &s;o to be. GOD is not prai&s;ed by loud tumultuous Joy, nor by Debauchery is he honoured. Such Honour and &s;uch Prai&s;e is the Sacrifice of Fools. Such Honour is Mockery, and &s;uch Prai&s;e Ingratitude. When GOD is truly honour'd, Men frequent his TEM|PLE, not the TAVERN, and there from the Heart celebrate the mighty ACTS of the LORD; their Joy is &s;erene, pure, peaceable, la&s;ting, and always in &s;ome Mea&s;ure proportioned to the Bene|fits received; which was the <HI>&s;econd</HI> Thing I pro|po&s;ed to ob&s;erve.</P>
<P>HOW great our Joy ought to be, will be be&s;t e&s;timated by taking a View of the Dangers we have been delivered from. TYRANNY, whether it re&s;pects the Body or the Mind, has in all Ages been ju&s;tly look'd upon as the wor&s;t of Evils. No Property or Civil Rights are &s;ecured where it ob|tains;
<PB N="112" REF="148">and there can be no Freedom Religion, where implicit Faith to &s;piritual Governors is in|&s;i&s;ted upon. In each Ca&s;e our Lives and For|tunes are continually expo&s;ed: An Expre&s;&s;ion only glancing towards Liberty, either Civil or Religious, might be, as it often has been, mi&s;interpreted for Trea&s;on; and an opulent Fortune might be, as it often has been, a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on for taking away the Life of the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>BUT that Tyranny is &s;till the more oppre&s;&s;ive, when it forces the Mind to a&s;&s;ent to Things which are entirely di&s;agreeable to Rea&s;on. As the Good of the People is the End of all Government, that End is generally fru&s;trated where ab&s;olute Mo|narchy prevails. Kings, as they are but Men, are ea&s;ily induced by Ambition to be lavi&s;h of the Blood and Fortunes of their People. Their Will is their Law; and their Sword, which is as vio|lent as their Will, is both the Guardian and Exe|cutioner of it. Intere&s;t is the grand Principle by which they are moved; but the Misfortune is, their own Grandeur, not the Good of the Subject, is
<PB N="113" REF="149">look'd upon as their proper Intere&s;t. Men of Integrity therefore, becau&s;e entirely aver&s;e to &s;uch Proceedings, are the Objects of their Hatred; and becau&s;e they are look'd upon as great Impediments in their Execution of unrea&s;onable, and therefore unju&s;t Projects, they mu&s;t be removed out of the Way; and they mu&s;t &s;uffer, becau&s;e they had the Cou|rage to STEM the TORRENT of COR|RUPTION, and be ju&s;t to THEMSELVES, their COUNTRY, their GOD. In &s;uch a di&s;|mal Situation, a gloomy melancholy A&s;pect is deemed TREASON, and to whi&s;per Liberty is DEATH.</P>
<P>THESE are the di&s;mal Effects of ab&s;olute Power, when centering in &s;ome Individuals. When indeed they are not inve&s;ted with Power, they can a&s;&s;ume the Appearance of the &s;ofte&s;t Hu|manity, and practi&s;e, in order to deceive the un|wary, all the &s;moother Arts of Per&s;ua&s;ion. But when they have &s;eized the Helm of Government, they will immediately neglect the People's Good,
<PB N="114" REF="150">that known CHART by which they ought to &s;teer their Cour&s;e, and &s;ub&s;titute in its Stead that mo&s;t variable of all Directors, their own Humour.</P>
<P>AND this, nay more than this, we might have expected, if the late violent Man had &s;ucceeded in his pernicious Schemes. Could we have hoped for Security of Liberty, when he not only was bred up at the Foot of Tyranny, but al&s;o &s;uck'd it in with his very Milk? And &s;uppo&s;e he were really de&s;cended from the STUARTS, which is very much que&s;tion'd, could this De&s;cent be any Recommendation to him? Have we not &s;een them endeavouring always to lay a&s;ide our Parliaments; which, if hone&s;t, we ought to look upon as the Guardians of our Liberties? Have we not known them oppre&s;s, by unju&s;t Taxes; and force tho&s;e that were to execute Ju&s;tice to give their A&s;&s;ent to Inju&s;tice. And can it be imagin'd, that this &s;up|po&s;ed SON of VIOLENCE would behave better than his <HI>heroick</HI> Forefathers? None &s;ure could imagine that he would, except the needy, the factious, and &s;uch as hold that imaginary Doctrine
<PB N="115" REF="151">of HEREDITARY RIGHT; or the Bigotry, Super&s;tition, and Idolatry of the Church of ROME.</P>
<P>BESIDES, what could we have hoped for from one who was at the Head of a bigotted Party, and had his own Head fill'd with ITALIAN Super&s;tition. It is meritorious with Men of this Stamp, tho' contrary to Rea&s;on, or the more glo|rious Light of the Go&s;pel, to propagate their un|rea&s;onable and wicked Opinions by FIRE and SWORD. I call them <HI>unrea&s;onable,</HI> becau&s;e they have no Foundation in Rea&s;on; and <HI>wicked,</HI> becau&s;e contrary to Scripture, our great CRITERION, by which we ought to judge of Doctrines, whether they be of GOD or MAN.</P>
<P>I MIGHT here give you a Detail of the &s;everal impious Doctrines of the ROMANISTS, and of the pernicious Tendency of each, in order to give you a ju&s;t Notion of the Dangers you have e&s;caped, and to rai&s;e in you a ju&s;t Sen&s;e of Gratitude for your Deliverance from them; but I &s;hall only ob|&s;erve at pre&s;ent, that as both our temporal and

<PB N="116" REF="154">eternal Welfare have been particularly con&s;ulted by our Deliverance from civil and religious Ty|ranny, we have the highe&s;t Rea&s;on imaginable to a&s;cribe unto our DELIVERER, Wor&s;hip and Strength, and to give the LORD the Honour due unto his Name; becau&s;e his WRATH has endured little more than the Twinkling of an EYE; becau&s;e he has given STRENGTH to his PEOPLE, and to his INHERITANCE the BLESSINGS of PEACE.</P>
<P>BUT as the Prai&s;e of the Lips of it&s;elf is no Gratitude, but mere Hypocri&s;y, I &s;hall con&s;ider as I propo&s;ed, <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> That the be&s;t Returns we can make for &s;uch Deliverances is a RELIGIOUS LIFE.</P>
<P>AS Obedience to a PARENT'S ju&s;t Com|mands is looked upon as &s;ufficient Gratitude for a PARENT'S Care; or as a SUBJECT'S dutiful Allegiance is a &s;uitable as well as an expected Return for a PRINCE'S Protection; &s;o a Regu|larity of Conduct, both in Religion and Morality,
<PB N="117" REF="155">is ju&s;tly expected by our gracious CREATOR. As long as we are ob&s;ervant of his ju&s;t Commands, &s;o long we are intitled to his Favour and Protec|tion; but when we &s;et at nought his COUNSEL, and will receive none of his REPROOF; when we leave the Paths of UPRIGHTNESS, to walk in the Ways of DARKNESS, and rejoice to do EVIL, and delight in the FROWARDNESS of the <HI>Wicked,</HI> Is it in the lea&s;t probable that GOD &s;hould &s;till be gracious, long-&s;uffering, and of great Goodne&s;s, and &s;end PEACE upon our JERUSALEM? Should we not rather expect Judgment in&s;tead of Mercy, Confu&s;ion in&s;tead of Order, and Di&s;cord in&s;tead of Harmony? Di&s;|agreements and Civil Rage among&s;t Individuals, as well as Kingdoms, are generally con&s;equent upon Immorality and Irreligion; and the&s;e are ge|nerally the Effects of Riches, and Power, and too great Plenty. When Men are placed in this emi|nent Situation, their Minds wax wanton, they for|get the Donor of the&s;e good Gifts, and &s;et up their HORN, and a &s;tiff NECK; their EYES are lofty, and their EYE-LIDS are lifted up. The
<PB N="118" REF="156">fatal Con&s;equence of this Pride is want of Charity, Meekne&s;s, Patience, and a mutual Forbearance of Injuries; from whence ari&s;e that motly and helli&s;h Crew of Mon&s;ters, Sedition, Tumult, War, Blood|&s;hed, and Death.</P>
<P>IN order to prevent which, it is incumbent upon each of us in our re&s;pective Stations to do to all Men, as we would they &s;hould do unto us in the like Circum&s;tances; always remembering, that our pre&s;ent and future Happine&s;s depend upon our Practice of this golden Rule. It will make us not only of one Mind in an Hou&s;e, but make us likewi&s;e live like a City at Unity with it&s;elf, who&s;e Inhabitants are virtuous amid&s;t Abundance, and religious without Super&s;tition, both in Pro&s;perity and Adver&s;ity. Being thus armed with the BREAST-PLATE of RIGHTEOUSNESS, the SWORD of the SPIRIT, and the HELMET of SALVATION, they are able to curb the In&s;o|lence of an haughty Enemy, and gain, thro' the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of an ALMIGHTY Protector, the un&s;peakable Advantages of a la&s;ting PEACE.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="157">THIS, if we are not wanting to our&s;elves, will always be our Ca&s;e. If we do not fail in our Duty, GOD will not fail us. <Q>His EYES are always over the Righteous, and his EARS are open unto their PRAYERS.</Q> Why then will we any longer provoke him to Anger by our evil Deeds, and make him &s;end among us, what we have lately &s;everely felt, the EVILS of WAR? What we have felt we &s;hould receive as a fatherly Correction, as a ROCK upon which our BARKS, by the Negligence of their MASTERS, had nigh &s;plit. And that we may not for the future hazard them again&s;t it, we &s;hould take Care that the Tide of Pa&s;&s;ion &s;well not too high, and force us by its Violence into evident De&s;truction. This, if we do, we &s;hall make a &s;uitable Return for the Deliverance we have lately received, and thereby recommend our&s;elves to the Favour of that Being who only can protect us, make us dwell &s;afely, and free us from the Apprehen&s;ion of every EVIL.</P>
<P>WHICH, that all of us for the future may be

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS &s;hort De&s;cription &s;eems to point out to us PRIDE, and one parti|cular Property of it, CONTEMPT. Loftine&s;s of Eyes &s;eems to intimate the inward Temper of Mind, a particular Di&s;temper which it labours under; and by the Eye-Lids being lifted up, it di&s;covers the Effect, which is produced by this Di&s;temper. As every Di&s;temper in the Body has its particular Symptom, and con&s;equently is di&s;coverable by it; &s;o is every Di&s;temper of the Mind expre&s;s'd by &s;ome outward Sign, as de|mon&s;trative of the inward Ailment. PRIDE
<PB N="124" REF="161">then, that empty Tumor, is well &s;ignified by high LOOKS and lofty EYES; becau&s;e every Tumor occa&s;ions a Stiffne&s;s of the Part affected; and if it be inward, and has any Relation to, or Com|munication with the outward Parts, an external Effect will be produced proportionable to the in|ward Cau&s;e. Thus PRIDE naturally &s;wells the EYE, gives an high, indirect, unob&s;erving CAST: And the EYE-LIDS lifted up &s;ignifies not only PRIDE, but al&s;o that the Per&s;on thus touch'd with it, is &s;omething, or, at lea&s;t thinks him&s;elf &s;omething, of a more exalted Nature than tho&s;e of the &s;ame Species with him&s;elf; and therefore it denotes CONTEMPT, which, of all other Effects, is lea&s;t becoming frail human Nature, except it has for its Object, that greate&s;t Di&s;grace of human Nature, VICE.</P>
<P>BUT it may be a&s;k'd, Is Pride in no Sen&s;e commendable? Mu&s;t it be condemn'd without Re&s;erve? And will it admit of no Limitation? May not a Man be &s;aid to be ambitious of be|having
<PB N="125" REF="162">well; and Ambition always &s;uppo&s;es Pride as the Foundation of it?</P>
<P>IN this Ca&s;e, where Pride is &s;uppos'd the Spring of good Actions, it is taken for COU|RAGE or a SENSE of DUTY. When a Man contradicts Sen&s;e, and acts in Oppo&s;ition to the common receiv'd Modes of Behaviour in the World, tho' he may be &s;aid, in the vulgar Way of &s;peaking, to be proud or ambitious of Well|doing; yet &s;uch Actions cannot derive their Ori|ginal from PRIDE: becau&s;e a bad Cau&s;e, &s;uch as Pride is, cannot produce a good Effect. Such Actions therefore mu&s;t have a better and more noble Cau&s;e; and, I think, no better than the be|fore mentioned can be a&s;&s;ign'd, namely, a SENSE of DUTY convey'd to Man by the GOSPEL-DISPENSATION. For this Sen&s;e has a noble End propos'd to it, HAPPINESS; and no Wonder that Courage, and all the Faculties of the Soul, are exerted in order to the Attainment of it.</P>
<P>BUT again, it may be a&s;k'd, if a Man that
<PB N="126" REF="163">has behav'd well, and even excell'd his Fellow-Creatures in performing the Duties of the GOSPEL, can have, for that Rea&s;on, a Tolera|tion for being proud: For good Actions always &s;uppo&s;e MERIT; and con&s;equently, one would imagine, that where there is Merit, a Man may think <HI>well</HI> of him&s;elf, or, in other Words, has Rea&s;on to be <HI>proud?</HI></P>
<P>SUPPOSING then, according to the Que&s;tion, that a Man acts up to the Pre&s;criptions of the GOSPEL; and &s;uppo&s;ing even more, that he even performs every Precept; he does not there|fore merit, becau&s;e he does only his Duty, and by Con&s;equence has no Rea&s;on to be proud. But, if we con&s;ider the Infirmities of human Nature, its Pronene&s;s to, and its &s;everal Lap&s;es, notwith&s;tand|ing its utmo&s;t Caution, into SIN, we may rea|&s;onably conclude, that Pride was no more made for fallible Man, than the JEWEL for the SWINE'S SNOUT.</P>
<P>BESIDES, there is a Difference between Pride,
<PB N="127" REF="164">and a Man's thinking <HI>well</HI> of him&s;elf. PRIDE is <HI>puffed up,</HI> and &s;uppo&s;es more Merit than it really has; it is bold, haughty, pre&s;umptuous, re|quires a particular Re&s;pect and Deference to be paid to it, is a SCORNER, and a Rai&s;er of Con|tention; and when the Sparks of Di&s;cord have nigh &s;pent their Force, one Hint or &s;ingle Expre&s;|&s;ion will add Fuel to the mo&s;t extingui&s;h'd Fire, and blow it into FLAME.</P>
<P>WHEREAS, the thinking <HI>well</HI> of one's &s;elf, tho' it does &s;uppo&s;e comparative Merit as the Foundation of it, is not incon&s;i&s;tent with the greate&s;t HUMILITY. Becau&s;e, if we act ac|cording to the Rule of Life deliver'd to us in the GOSPEL, we mu&s;t be virtuous, and more than nominal Chri&s;tians; and con&s;equently, there will ari&s;e from &s;uch a Tenor of Action, a tender SELF-COMPLACENCY, or &s;ort of SELF-ESTEEM, which the <HI>wi&s;e</HI> Di&s;po&s;er of the DRAMA has, out of his great Goodne&s;s, given us; not only as a Fore-ta&s;te of our future Allotment, but likewi&s;e as a pre&s;ent Reward and Encouragement for us to be|have
<PB N="128" REF="165">well in our &s;everal future Scenes upon the Stage of Life. We may then think well of our|&s;elves upon a very laudable Account; becau&s;e, upon comparing our Lives and Conver&s;ation with the GOSPEL RULE, we find, in the Re&s;ult of the Compari&s;on, that an entire Harmony reigns between our Faith and Practice; and con&s;equently the Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having acted our Parts well upon this great Theatre, mu&s;t not only, in the &s;till Scenes of Life, but al&s;o when we &s;ail upon a troubled Ocean, in a &s;hatter'd BARK, afford us the greate&s;t Comfort imaginable. Thus plea&s;ant is one &s;elf-approving Hour; it &s;hews the Soul's Health, and contributes to the Satisfaction of the Body: whereas PRIDE is the Di&s;ea&s;e of the Soul, and is to it, what too great Fulne&s;s of BLOOD is to the Body, the Ve&s;&s;els mu&s;t bur&s;t by being over&s;trained, and a Di&s;&s;olution is the &s;oone&s;t occa&s;ion'd by a TUMOR.</P>
<P>BUT, it may be a&s;ked, whether there be not a DIGNITY in human Nature; and if there is,
<PB N="129" REF="166">that very Expre&s;&s;ion &s;uppo&s;es a Rea&s;on to ground PRIDE upon</P>
<P>THOSE who talk the mo&s;t loudly of Man's DIGNITY, may mention it upon three Accounts: either becau&s;e it may boa&s;t of a divine Original; or, upon account of its future Pro&s;pect; or, be|cau&s;e it is endow'd with a rea&s;oning Principle, which enables us to di&s;cover, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, its Duty towards that Being, who gave it its Exi&s;t|ence. And tho' many talk of this Dignity in any of the&s;e Sen&s;es, yet they do not &s;uppo&s;e that Man has &s;ufficient Rea&s;ons to be proud; &s;ince the WORM boa&s;ts the &s;ame ORIGINAL; &s;ince HUMILITY becomes a PILGRIM that has no continuing City here, and that is in que&s;t after one to come; and &s;ince Rea&s;on, at the &s;ame Time that it evidences the Strength, gives demon&s;trative Proof of the Weakne&s;s of una&s;&s;i&s;ted human Na|ture.</P>
<P>SINCE the PRIDE is not, in any of the be|fore mentioned Ca&s;es, a commendable Quality;
<PB N="130" REF="167">and &s;ince there is a GENERATION who&s;e EYES are lofty, and who&s;e EYE-LIDS are lifted up, I &s;hall con&s;ider,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. THE principal CAUSES of PRIDE. And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. TWO particular SPECIES of it, and their EFFECTS, as di&s;coverable in human Na|ture. And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>LASTLY, I &s;hall conclude with an Exhortation to HUMILITY.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>FIRST then, I am to con&s;ider the principal CAUSES of PRIDE; and the&s;e are, Strength, Beauty, Riches, Honour, and Knowledge; con|cerning each of which I &s;hall &s;peak in the Or|der they now &s;tand. As to the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> namely, STRENGTH, we &s;hall have little Rea&s;on to be proud of it, if we do but con&s;ider how infinitely weak it is with re&s;pect to GOD that made us, how frail with re&s;pect to DURATION, and how liable every Moment to be lo&s;t. We generally
<PB N="131" REF="168">value, or at lea&s;t ought to value Things, either upon account of their DURATION or USE|FULNESS. A Man's Strength, in the ordinary Cour&s;e of Things, cannot be of long Continuance; it may &s;tay with him in the Bloom and Meridian of Life: But when he de&s;cends the Hill, the Blood no longer performs the &s;ame bri&s;k Circulation; Nature grows weak and languid, and Sickne&s;s, at la&s;t, puts a final Period to the Ruins of old Age. Thus this boa&s;ted STRENGTH, or rather Weak|ne&s;s, is &s;oon brought to DESOLATION, and becomes the FOOD of WORMS. Such a Con|&s;ideration is &s;ufficient, one would imagine, to hin|der us from rejoicing in having &s;trong Bones, Nerves, and Sinews. But, con&s;idering the many Accidents of Life, which in an In&s;tant can deprive us of our mighty STRENGTH, we have no Rea|&s;on to glory in it upon account of its DURATION.</P>
<P>ITS USEFULNESS however, one would think, might furni&s;h us with Matter for Pride; &s;ince by it we are enabled to &s;urmount great Dif|ficulties, and endure the &s;everal Vici&s;&s;itudes of
<PB N="132" REF="169">FORTUNE with the greater Firmne&s;s, and are in a Capacity to attack the common Enemy of our Country (for<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> GIBSON'<HI>s</HI> Anatomy, <HI>p.</HI> 263.</NOTE> Courage is oftner owing to Con|&s;titution than Reflection) with greater Magnani|mity.&mdash; Notwith&s;tanding 'tis attended with the&s;e and many &s;uch Advantages, yet we ought not to conclude from thence, that a Man &s;hould &s;o far forget him&s;elf as to be ignorant that it is the GIFT of GOD; and that 'tis the &s;ame Being that he ought to be grateful to for the Continuance of it.&mdash;Be|&s;ides, if our CREATOR had thought it very per|fective of our Natures, it would not be &s;o un|equally di&s;tributed among&s;t the human Race; for it often happens that STRENGTH is void of WISDOM, and that the greate&s;t Souls take up their Re&s;idence in the minute&s;t Bodies: which certainly is a pre&s;umptive Argument, at lea&s;t, that we ought not be proud of our great STRENGTH: But, if Men will be proud of it, let them herd with the Brute-Creation, who enjoy it in a much greater Perfection, without &s;hewing they are proud
<PB N="133" REF="170">of it; and then they may learn, like NEBUCHAD|NEZZAR, not to be high-minded, but fear.</P>
<P>BUT if nothing el&s;e would bring &s;uch proud Men to Rea&s;on, the bad Effects con&s;equent upon this &s;ort of Pride might be &s;ufficient to terrify them from thus mi&s;placing their Affections. Con|tention, Duelling, Blood&s;hed, and Death, are too often the mournful Attendants upon it. Such proud Contemners of HEAVEN do not con&s;ider, that a BLESSING is particularly pronounced upon tho&s;e who are the Maintainers of PEACE; and that they, and they particularly, &s;hall be called the CHILDREN of GOD.</P>
<P>AS Strength affords no Rea&s;on for Pride; &s;o neither does BEAUTY, a Set of Features or Com|plexion, nor a ju&s;t Harmony and Proportion between the &s;everal Parts of the Body. The FLOWERS of the FIELD are ju&s;t Emblems of BEAUTY, and are a lively Repre&s;entation of its Frailty and &s;hort Duration. It appears charming in the Spring and Summer of Life; but in its
<PB N="134" REF="171">Winter, &s;carce any faint Traces or Re&s;emblance, of what it was, appear. Hollow Eyes, a wrinkled furrowed Front, and meagre Cheeks, are the di&s;|mal Exchanges; and make us reflect upon this pre|&s;ent Earth, which, by its Ruins, gives us a faint Idea of the Beauty of the ancient World. To this unplea&s;ant State the mo&s;t con&s;ummate BEAUTY will be reduced by OLD AGE. It is not, how|ever, the only Enemy that Beauty has to encoun|ter with; the whole Family of DISEASES are &s;et in Battle-Array again&s;t it, and attack it very often in the Bloom of Life, and bring it to a &s;udden De&s;olation. But how di&s;mal is the Condition of a Beauty either decay'd by Sickne&s;s or Old Age! Can &s;he lo&s;e this Cau&s;e of her Pride without a Sigh? Nay, rather does &s;he not &s;hed Floods of Tears at the very Thought of it? Is &s;he not de|jected, &s;ullen, melancholy? And, what is wor&s;t of all, when &s;he appears abroad, is &s;he not con&s;cious that tho&s;e, whom &s;he formerly contemn'd, will &s;corn her, and turn her to Ridicule? Will not the Neglect of cultivating her better Part, and of pro|curing what is above all Price, and the greate&s;t
<PB N="135" REF="172">Ornaments of her Sex, the Beauties of the Mind, &s;trike her dumb with Amazement at her own ig|norant Choice? What is it now that &s;he has le&s;t to charm Mankind with in the Room of Beauty? Has &s;he good Sen&s;e; nay, has &s;he tolerable unim|prov'd Sen&s;e? Do not her former Admirers won|der at them&s;elves for thinking her a WIT whil&s;t &s;he had Beauty? She mo&s;tly re&s;embles an IDOL placed in a magnificent TEMPLE, who&s;e Propor|tions are ju&s;t, Features regular, and Varni&s;h ex|qui&s;ite. In &s;uch a Situation the Spectators think &s;omething more than Human inhabits the Place, till TIME, that great Di&s;coverer of human Va|nities, makes the Temple and Idol gradually de|cay, and moulder into its primitive Atoms: And how ridiculous mu&s;t it be to find, after &s;o many Years of Idolatry, in&s;tead of a DEITY, an un|thinking IDOL! Thus a proud BEAUTY ap|pears upon the Stage of Life; where Art and Na|ture equally contribute to the Decoration of her Externals; where &s;he has &s;imilar Devotion paid to her, and much the &s;ame wrong-headed unthink|ing Attendants, till Time or Accident di&s;covers
<PB N="136" REF="173">the Cheat, and frees he Admirers from their im|pious Devotions.</P>
<P>BEAUTY, indeed, when attended with Inno|cence, and cloath'd in Humility, attract &s;trongly the Eyes of the Beholders, awes the Libertine into Virtue, &s;ilences, by a con&s;tant Per&s;everance in Well-doing, the Stings of Envy and Detraction, humanizes the cruel, and poli&s;hes the Savage into Man. But &s;uch a divine Per&s;on is a Rarity: It appears only &s;ometimes in the World like a METEOR; which, tho' it enlightens, a&s;toni&s;hes the Spectator, and fills them with nothing but Admiration.</P>
<P>BEAUTY then, when unattended with Virtue and good Sen&s;e, mu&s;t chu&s;e it&s;elf, as 'tis of a &s;o|cial Nature, Companions of a degenerate Kind; and there are too many to pre&s;s into the Service. VICES, of all Complexions, pre&s;ent them&s;elves as VOLUNTIERS; and the Mind being at Lei&s;ure, 'tis no Wonder that they gain Admittance, and that Follies prevail in the Ab&s;ence of WISDOM.
<PB N="137" REF="174">Why &s;hould we any longer admire that Pride and Vanity are the Handmaids of Beauty? &s;ince all the Avenues to the Soul are not guarded by Wi&s;|dom and Prudence; and &s;ince that bu&s;y flattering Thing within us mu&s;t have Materials to work upon; and &s;ince there is no nearer an Object of Thought than SELF, it may be an ea&s;y Con&s;e|quence to be proud of this accidental, tran&s;itory, per&s;onal Perfection, who&s;e Enjoyment is TROU|BLE, and who&s;e End is BITTERNESS. Be|&s;ides, as in SEDITION, there are never wanting Incendaries to blow up the Sparks of Di&s;cord into Flame, &s;o it happens to a beautiful Per&s;on: En|comiums, Prai&s;e, Adulation, are generally the baneful Poi&s;on &s;erv'd up to BEAUTY: Each Pa&s;|&s;age to the Heart therefore &s;hould be fortified by WISDOM; otherwi&s;e the Poi&s;on will work and de&s;troy that Virtue, mo&s;t becoming frail Human Nature, HUMILITY.</P>
<P>IF Beauty, indeed, was of a durable Nature, there might be &s;ome Excu&s;e for being proud of it: But &s;ince 'tis rather an imaginary than a real
<PB N="138" REF="175">Good; and &s;ince 'tis a Snare rather than a Ble&s;|&s;ing to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; &s;ince it leads People to the Cultivation of the Body, to the Neglect of the bet|ter Part, the Soul; and &s;ince 'tis almo&s;t as frail as the FLOWER of the FIELD; we &s;hould no longer, for the&s;e Rea&s;ons, be proud of Beauty: But, if we will, let us con&s;ider that to be proud of a Frailty, and con&s;equently of a Weakne&s;s, is the Di&s;grace, the DEATH of REASON.</P>
<P>BUT, as frail and peri&s;hing as Strength and Beauty are, yet, in the true E&s;timate of Things, we have le&s;s Rea&s;on to be proud of RICHES; &s;ince they are more foreign to us, and contribute nothing to the Perfection of our Natures; &s;ince they are &s;aid to make them&s;elves WINGS and to <HI>fly</HI> away; and &s;ince they ought to be valued ac|cording to the U&s;e that is made of them. We ought therefore rather to be proud of the U&s;e|fulne&s;s of Riches, than Riches them&s;elves; becau&s;e it is not po&s;&s;ible that inanimate Matter &s;hould have any intrin&s;ick Merit in it. One would imagine, that a little &s;hining Metal would not make us look
<PB N="139" REF="176">big, and attract our Attention more than what is of infinitely more Con&s;equence, the TREASURES of HEAVEN. But, 'tis &s;aid, that RICHES make the GENTLEMAN: And &s;o it &s;eems, if we would form our Judgment from the general Behaviour of the World. If a Man has a &s;plendid Fortune, he is thought to have Rea&s;on to be proud; and &s;uch a Deference is generally paid this Son of Fortune, that he begins to think him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of &s;ome Qualification that he did not per|ceive before. No Wonder then that this Man of OPULENCE and CONDITION, con&s;idering that he has &s;o many cringing, fawning Sycophants about him, becomes his own IDOL. Notwith&s;tanding, however, the wrong Judgment of the World in general, it has been ju&s;tly ob&s;erv'd, that Manners and good Sen&s;e con&s;titute the Man, without taking the additional APPARATUS of Fortune into Con&s;ideration. Our Nece&s;&s;ities, indeed, and Conveniences of Life, without mentioning them as nece&s;&s;ary in every State, make Riches valuable. They may be &s;plendid Proofs of HUMILITY, and other Chri&s;tian Graces; they may, by our
<PB N="140" REF="177">feeding the hungry, and in&s;tructing the ignorant, and other In&s;tances of Chri&s;tian Charity, not only be the happy Pa&s;&s;ports thro' the Gates of true FAME here; but, what is inexpre&s;&s;ibly better, convey us to a glorious heavenly JERUSALEM, where are RIVERS of PLEASURE at GOD'S Right-hand for evermore. Who then in his Sen&s;es would make any other U&s;e of Riches? Who any longer would make them the In&s;truments of Pride, Ambition, Pomp, and Grandeur? Nay, who, that has any Reflection, would place any Tru&s;t in <HI>un|certain</HI> Riches? Do they &s;hew any GODLIKE POWER? Can they &s;ave or deliver from PAIN? Or, can they free us from DEATH? Are they not rather oftene&s;t the In&s;truments of Pain, and the infallible Cau&s;e of a &s;udden Death? Why then &s;hould we look upon them as our Support and ROCK of DEFENCE, &s;ince the Hour of DEATH, the mo&s;t &s;olemn Part of Time allow'd to Morta|lity, di&s;covers their Weakne&s;s and want of Power? They are then &s;een with Impartiality, and found, like all other Idols of Mankind, but VANITY.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="178">BUT ought not that to be exceedingly valued that procures us all the Satisfaction in Life, and makes LIFE'S CUP go &s;weetly down? Ought not that which procures us Friends, Dependents, Equipage, rich Lands, magnificent Buildings, and the PRIDE of Life, to gain our Affections more than any thing be&s;ides? Would we not be ungrate|ful if we did not &s;et our Hearts upon them?</P>
<P>WE would be ungrateful if we <HI>did</HI> &s;et our Hearts upon them. GOD will not &s;uffer divided Affecti|ons; for he is a jealous GOD, and will not allow of any Thing to &s;tand in Competition with him. 'Tis rea&s;onable that it &s;hould be &s;o. Are not we his Workman&s;hip? Did he not fa&s;hion us? And, if he did, as Rea&s;on and Revelation loudly pro|claim that he did, is it not rea&s;onable that the Crea|ture &s;hould pay Homage to the CREATOR in Token of his Dependence? If in civil Life one petty PRINCE &s;hall pay Homage to another of &s;uperior Dignity for &s;ome little earthly Dominion; how much more agreeable to Rea&s;on is it, that he, who giveth Life and every good Thing, &s;hould
<PB N="142" REF="179">receive daily Homage of PRAISE and THANKSGI|VING, from tho&s;e he has created? Be&s;ides, is it not ab&s;urd to love a Creature more than the CRE|ATOR? Are not Riches his Creatures, and are they not fram'd by the wi&s;e Di&s;po&s;er of all Things for our U&s;e? We ought not then to turn GOD'S Mercies to our De&s;truction, but to make them &s;ub|&s;ervient to one great End we &s;hould always have in view, the SALVATION of our SOULS. This will always make Riches flow in their proper Channel, and their Stream will convey us regularly and uniformly till we reach the Ocean of ETER|NITY. If we make Riches our STAY, our BOAST, our COMFORT, and only Support, it would be no Wonder if GOD &s;ay to us as he did to the rich Man in the GOSPEL, <Q>Ye FOOLS, this Night your SOULS are required of you.</Q> This Exertion of his Power would &s;hew the No|thingne&s;s of Riches, and his Right of Dominion.</P>
<P>AND tho' Riches are &s;aid to procure us the Sa|tisfactions of Life, yet the glittering Out&s;ide of an ample Fortune is too often like the DOCTOR'S
<PB N="143" REF="180">MEDICINE, or the WHITED SEPULCHRE; Poi&s;on or Rottenne&s;s are generally latent under the&s;e &s;pecious Coverings, and are true Emblems of high Life, Pomp, and Splendor. Men only &s;ee the gilded EXTERNAL; they cannot &s;ee Care, Envy, Malice, Ambition, and all the Pa&s;&s;ions, &s;trengthned by luxurious Living, by Indulgence, and for want of proper Controul. Could Men &s;ee the&s;e licentious unre&s;trained Pa&s;&s;ions of the Mind exerted, and PRIDE directing this Storm of the Soul, they might have a very good Notion of a raging SEA, where Waves &s;ucceed Waves with the utmo&s;t Violence, and are agitated into Foam by the &s;tronge&s;t of all Pilots, the WIND. Thus it is when Rea&s;on does not pre&s;ide at the Helm; in&s;tead of the Pa&s;&s;ions, tho&s;e Elements of Life, directing and wafting us like gentle BREEZES thro' this troubled OCEAN of Life, we find nothing but Di&s;order and a kind of ANARCHY; where each &s;eparate Pa&s;&s;ion would direct the HUMAN BARK its own Way, with|out li&s;tening to the Dictates of Rea&s;on, or the pun|gent Gnawings of a troubled Con&s;cience.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="181">BESIDES, we often find that amid&s;t the Abundance of all Things, the Heart is cloy'd with de&s;iring, and the Sen&s;es with Gratification; and, on the contrary, we may ob&s;erve, that there are others who&s;e De&s;ires increa&s;e with their Re|venues, and, like HAMAN, their Minds are not ea&s;y or &s;erene, but rather a jarring Scene of un|harmoniz'd Pa&s;&s;ions, as long as they meet with any Ob&s;tacles to their a&s;piring Hopes.</P>
<P>HENCE it appears, that Satisfaction or Con|tentment is not con&s;equent upon the Enjoyment of RICHES; and therefore we have no Rea&s;on to be proud of that, which, impartially con&s;idered, according to its real Worth, produces no &s;olid Content. Pain, Sickne&s;s, and Death, are good CRITERIONS by which we may judge of their Worth, and di&s;cover them in any of the&s;e States as a fal&s;e FRIEND in the Time of ADVERSITY; neither of them di&s;cover any Signs of Relief, but are &s;trong convincing Arguments of Affections mi&s;placed, and of the want of a quick Apprehen|&s;ion and a di&s;cerning Judgment.</P>

<P>IN a former Di&s;cour&s;e upon the&s;e Words, I propos'd to con&s;ider the &s;everal CAUSES of PRIDE, which generally excite that helli&s;h Pa&s;&s;ion in human Nature. The&s;e Cau&s;es which I took Notice of, &s;uch as Strength, Beauty, Riches, Honour, and Knowledge, are the great Elaters of the human Mind; tho' indeed &s;ome, to the Di&s;grace of Rea&s;on be it &s;poken, are &s;o lo&s;t in Sen&s;uality, that they are proud of Vice and Folly: And others again are &s;o &s;tupidly vain, and are &s;o little de&s;erving of the Ble&s;&s;ings of Health,
<PB N="148" REF="184">that they are proud of nothing but what is an entail'd Cur&s;e upon human Nature, DISEASE. If &s;uch have Rea&s;on to be proud, the WORMS certainly, that devour &s;uch vain corrupted Wretches, ought no longer by their creeping to &s;hew their Humility, but erect the HEAD, and &s;et up a &s;tiff NECK. Others again are &s;o humble, that they are proud of Di&s;grace, Contempt, and, what now-a-days pa&s;&s;es for the greate&s;t Contumely, and is the mo&s;t dete&s;ted, POVERTY: And others, in &s;hort, are &s;o humble, that they are proud of a wick|ed <HI>rich</HI> Man's Company; and think &s;o meanly of them&s;elves, as fir&s;t to get drunk, and afterwards, like SWINE, to wallow in the MIRE: And &s;ome Men are &s;o &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, as to to think it an Honour, and are con&s;equently proud, of being the &s;tanding Je&s;t of Men &s;uperior to them&s;elves either in Fortune or Preferment; and they mea&s;ure their own Greatne&s;s, which is an amazing Argument of their Stupidity, according to the Ridicule with which they are receiv'd. But &s;uch Men that are thus ridiculou&s;ly proud, are not worth a &s;erious Reproof; I leave them therefore to be treated with,
<PB N="149" REF="185">what they are &s;o mighty fond of, RIDICULE. I &s;hall proceed to the more natural Cau&s;es of PRIDE which remain to be con&s;ider'd, namely, HONOUR and KNOWLEDGE.</P>
<P>AND <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> with re&s;pect to HONOUR, &s;ome may imagine that it is a good Foundation for Pride; becau&s;e it &s;uppo&s;es Merit in the Per&s;on honour'd; it &s;uppo&s;es Honour to be due to per|&s;onal Merit; and that Merit thus honour'd &s;hould appear &s;omething &s;uperior to the re&s;t of Mankind: becau&s;e Eminence of Station conveys to us an Idea of Grandeur, Magnificence, and Superiority.</P>
<P>THAT Merit &s;hould be honour'd is not the Que&s;tion; but whether the Per&s;on thus honour'd upon account of his Merit &s;hould be proud of it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s the Que&s;tion to be &s;olv'd; which indeed will admit of no Di&s;pute, if we do but con&s;ider its Uncertainty, Emptine&s;s, and Un&s;atisfactorine&s;s. HONOUR, as its con&s;i&s;ts in the Idea of Per&s;ons about us, mu&s;t be very precarious. Some there are, who will not allow us any Merit; and con&s;e|quently
<PB N="150" REF="186">will neither honour or e&s;teem us. Others there are, who, notwith&s;tanding we have no Merit, yet, upon account of &s;ome Advantage accruing to them from us, will both honour and e&s;teem us. Hence then this &s;ort of Honour is uncertain, be|cau&s;e it depends upon the Notions of People about us; it is of a precarious Tenure, becau&s;e People's Minds are changeable upon the lea&s;t Hint; and, by Con&s;equence, we are often deemed honourable or di&s;honourable with little or no Rea&s;on, out of Whim and Contradiction, out of Malice or Good-nature. This is the general Way of judging by the Bulk of Mankind. But if we would be proud of any &s;ort of Honour attributed to us, we &s;hould be proud then, and only then, when the Man of true Honour, and an hone&s;t Heart, of &s;ound Principles, and impartial Judgment, conde&s;cends to honour us with particular Marks of E&s;teem; then we might conclude with the MORALIST, <Q>That it is a glorious Thing to be commended by a per&s;on of known Integrity.</Q> This, how|ever, in reality, ought not to be the Occa&s;ion of Pride; but rather an Incentive to adorn our Minds
<PB N="151" REF="187">with every Chri&s;tian Virtue which would promote the Peace and Tranquility of the human Soul.</P>
<P>IF we con&s;ider the Honours and Titles of Men in an higher Sphere of Action, we &s;hall &s;ee le&s;s Rea&s;on to be proud of them. When Men are in full Pur&s;uit after them, they are charming to the Eye, and fill the Imagination with chimerical No|tions of Happine&s;s; the Pro&s;pect at a Di&s;tance is delightful, tho' the Way to them, is, like the Way to HEAVEN, narrow, rugged, intricate. They appear like a MEADOW at a Di&s;tance, nothing but one continued BED of FLOWERS; but when the Candidates for them have gain'd the Summit, they find, to their great Di&s;appointment, the FLOWERS thin-&s;own, the WEEDS innumerable. Thus empty and un&s;atisfactory are the Honours and Titles that Men make &s;uch a Bu&s;tle about: They are like the poor MAHOMETAN'S Dreams of &s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ure in his future Paradi&s;e; which, if Scripture and Rea&s;on may be credited, will, in the End, like all other DREAMS, appear no|thing el&s;e but mere Delu&s;ion. That Honours and
<PB N="152" REF="188">Titles are of the &s;ame un&s;atisfactory Nature, we are inform'd by that be&s;t of all Informers, EXPE|RIENCE. While Men are in que&s;t after them, they are then thought to be great Augmentations of Happine&s;s; not con&s;idering, that what they pur|&s;ue is within them&s;elves, in their own Power: otherwi&s;e the greate&s;t, far the greate&s;t Part of Mankind, that are depriv'd of Honours and Titles, would be unhappy, and live in a particular Flat|ne&s;s of Spirits, would be pen&s;ive, and overcome with the black Pa&s;&s;ions. We find, on the con|trary, that Happine&s;s is confin'd to no Station; if a Man will think him&s;elf happy, he is happy: it therefore con&s;i&s;ts in Opinion, is a THOUGHT, and has its Exi&s;tence no-where but in the BRAIN. Tho&s;e then that are content with their pre&s;ent Allotment a&s;&s;ign'd them by Providence, are as happy as this pre&s;ent State of Things will al|low them. But &s;uch as are always thir&s;ting after &s;omething external, are unhappy: the De|&s;ire &s;uppo&s;es a Want; and where Want is, there is a Want of Happine&s;s. Both tho&s;e then that are in que&s;t after Honours and Titles, and tho&s;e that
<PB N="153" REF="189">recede from Honours and Preferments, and find no Satisfaction in Titles, mu&s;t be unhappy; be|cau&s;e Change of Station &s;uppo&s;es Unhappine&s;s in the Stations from whence both Parties receded. Agreeable to this is the Opinion of the HEA|THEN MORALIST, <Q>We &s;eem, &s;ays he, as if &s;urfeited with the Toils of STATE, and therefore chu&s;e a fit Place for Contemplation; yet in that very Place of Retirement, where we thought to have met with Compo&s;ure, Ambi|tion &s;prings up with a fre&s;h GALE, and drives our &s;hatter'd BARKS into a &s;econd OCEAN of Troubles.</Q> Thus Happine&s;s is the Growth of no particular Soil, confined to no Age or Situation in Life; 'tis every where, where there is Content|ment, but never there where the Appetities are un|ruly, and where Cares are predominant. The &s;till Scenes of Life bid faire&s;t for it; and high Life is the mo&s;t remarkable for the Want of it. Why then &s;hould Men pur&s;ue after that, which, in the very Pur&s;uit, is trouble&s;ome; who&s;e Enjoyment is un&s;atisfactory, and who&s;e Conclu&s;ion is Vanity? And certainly 'tis very unbecoming a rational Be|ing,
<PB N="154" REF="190">who&s;e Hopes and Views are not limited by Time, but extended to Eternity, to pur&s;ue after, place his Confidence in, and be proud of Unhap|pine&s;s. SOLOMON, as much as any Man living, experienced the Truth of this Ob&s;ervation. He gathered together every Thing that he thought would contribute to his Happine&s;s; he became great, and increa&s;ed more than any before him at JERUSALEM, and with-held not his Heart from any Joy: But what was the Re&s;ult of this Enquiry? Nothing but a melancholy REFLECTION, that all was VANITY and VEXATION of SPIRIT. In the next Place he con&s;ider'd WISDOM and FOLLY, and MADNESS, and &s;aw that Wi&s;dom excelleth Folly, as LIGHT excelleth DARK|NESS. But whether we ought to be proud of it &s;hall be our next Enquiry.</P>
<P>THAT we ought not to be proud of WIS|DOM, the End propo&s;ed to be obtained by it is a &s;ufficient Evidence. It has been ob&s;erv'd that all our Knowledge is to know our&s;elves. We are to con&s;ider the different Relations we &s;tand in to
<PB N="155" REF="191">GOD and Mankind, our exten&s;ive Ignorance and minute Knowledge. If this be thoroughly weigh|ed, this very Knowledge will awake the &s;leeping Sparks of Humanity in us, and make us think ju&s;tly of GOD, meanly of our&s;elves, and humane|ly of our Fellow-Creatures. Rea&s;on was given us for wi&s;e Ends. At the &s;ame Time that it a&s;|&s;i&s;ts us in the &s;everal Nece&s;&s;aries and Occurrences of Life; it is a Light to guide our Steps in all moral and religious Truths. But at the &s;ame Time that it is a principal A&s;&s;i&s;tant in the Attain|ment of Knowledge, it ought to be a Check upon us, on Suppo&s;ition that we are more knowing than other Men. Letters were term'd HUMANIORES by the LATINS; becau&s;e they were &s;uppo&s;ed to poli&s;h and refine Men's Manners: And the POETS &s;uppo&s;ed that Learning had the Power of huma|nizing Savages into Men. But 'tis &s;trange that tho&s;e, who are the mo&s;t remarkable for an exten|&s;ive Knowledge, &s;hould be the greate&s;t Examples of INHUMANITY: Stranger &s;till that tho&s;e, who teach Mankind their Duty, &s;hould be the fir&s;t TRANSGRESSORS of it: Strange&s;t &s;till that
<PB N="156" REF="192">tho&s;e, who contradict the whole World, &s;hould not be able to bear one &s;ingle Contradiction. If in common Conver&s;ation &s;uch give a full Liberty to their Tongues, Scandal flows from them in co|pious Streams, and, like WATER that partakes of the MINERAL thro' which it pa&s;&s;es, always leaves a Stain behind that denotes its Impurity. Such Men have not yet attained the greate&s;t Knowledge, the Knowledge of them&s;elves. They have indeed the Knowledge that PUFFETH UP; which, like the PHILOSOPHY of old, is vain, empty, and engenders PRIDE.</P>
<P>BUT ought not the Knowledge of our exce&s;|&s;ive IGNORANCE to pull down our VANITY? Do we know certainly what pa&s;&s;es within us; do we know our&s;elves? Do not we &s;eem rather to have no Notion, if we are to be judg'd by our Ac|tions, of our BEINGS, End, and Aim? And with re&s;pect to Things without us, can we be &s;aid to have any Knowledge to boa&s;t of? Can we comprehend their Natures, U&s;es, and Ends for which they were created? Do we know Cau&s;es
<PB N="157" REF="193">from<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is &s;carce a Production in Nature, &s;ays the great Mr BOYLE, the U&s;es whereof to human Life are thoroughly known or under&s;tood.

<PB N="158" REF="196">it, yet it has the Impudence to condemn the Structure of the whole. So 'tis with Man placed in this Sphere of Action; he is more apt to cavil with GOD'S Proceedings, than humbly to ac|quie&s;ce in real Ignorance. The Truth is, every one would be term'd a Man of Knowledge. Hence ari&s;e Endeavours to &s;trike out new Lights, which oftentimes, in&s;tead of &s;erving as a CLUE to guide us out of the Laybrinths of Error, only increa&s;e the Mazes, and bewilder the Rea&s;oning Faculty. Hence ari&s;e Cavils, Di&s;putes, Critici&s;ms. Authors are made to &s;peak, by a perver&s;e Inter|pretation, a Sen&s;e they never meant; and often every Error, every Folly, is to the SCRIPTURE laid. A &s;ad In&s;tance this, of the Ignorance or Per|ver&s;ene&s;s of human Nature! A pregnant Proof of Vanity, Self-&s;ufficiency, and Di&s;ingenuity! Such &s;hould con&s;ider, however, that then Men &s;hew the greate&s;t Signs of Knowledge, when they ingenu|ou&s;ly own, that they know nothing as they ought to know. This Humility is generally the Product of great Experience, laborious Thinking, Love of Retirement, and an a&s;&s;iduous Application to Books;
<PB N="159" REF="197">and no Wonder, &s;ince the Knowledge of the great Ignorance of Mankind naturally leads, or ought to lead Men, at lea&s;t, to the Su&s;picion of their own.</P>
<P>BUT &s;uppo&s;ing that we do know a little, which is nothing in Compari&s;on to what we are ignorant of, what Rea&s;on is there for us to be proud of it? If it be true, that an Increa&s;e of KNOWLEDGE is an Increa&s;e of SORROW, cer|tainly there can be no Rea&s;on or Foundation for being proud of Knowledge. Would not every Per&s;on of Sen&s;e imagine that he, who is proud of a Di&s;ea&s;e or any Di&s;temper, becau&s;e 'tis fa&s;hionable, is a proper Object for Ridicule? And, by Parity of Rea&s;on, I think, none who have experienced that the Search after Knowledge is painful, cau&s;es a Weari&s;omene&s;s of the FLESH, and damages the Organs of THINKING, will conclude that Men ought to be proud of what they know; becau&s;e 'tis an Ab&s;urdity to maintain that Men ought to be proud of that which contributes largely to the Unhappine&s;s of Life.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="198">THIS Pride, however, does not take its Ri&s;e from the Knowledge of our DUTY. Chri&s;tianity in&s;pires no &s;uch Meanne&s;s; HUMILITY is pre|&s;crib'd as the propere&s;t Dre&s;s for Man to appear in; and human Nature is the Object of univer&s;al Benevolence. If Men were not above &s;tudying the SACRED RULE of Life, we &s;hould meet with more Humility, and le&s;s Contempt; more Can|dour in judging; and le&s;s Rancour; more Sincerity, and le&s;s Cunning; a tenderer Regard for human Mi&s;ery, and le&s;s Fondne&s;s for SELF.</P>
<P>BUT as long as this divine LUMINARY'S for|got, neglected, de&s;pis'd, it is no Wonder that FOLLY &s;prings up and choaks the remaining Seeds of VIRTUE. Is there a Man wi&s;e in his own CONCEIT, that boa&s;ts of his &s;uperior Know|ledge, and, in con&s;equence of that, grows &s;uper|cilious? There is more Hope of a FOOL than of him. Is there a Man pa&s;&s;ionate when his Sen|timents are contradicted? There is more Hope of the Conver&s;ion of an INFIDEL than of him. Is there a Man doubting of, and con&s;equently en|quiring
<PB N="161" REF="199">into the Foundation of moral Obligation, whether it is placed in the Nature, Rea&s;on, or Truth, or Relation of Things, without taking into Con&s;i|deration the greate&s;t Incentive to Action, the WILL of GOD? Such a one may &s;hew him&s;elf a proud Rea&s;oner; but he will make us think, that he has little Rea&s;on for Action, and is not too much bur|then'd with CHRISTIANITY. Such generally u&s;her their Sentiments into the World not with too much Civility and Complai&s;ance. Words, how|ever, deliver'd with Mode&s;ty, Deference, and In|genuity, be&s;t become fallible Man; whereas Words deliver'd with a &s;cornful Tone of Voice, with a contemptible Look, and haughty Ge&s;ture, either move our Pity, Laughter, or Hatred of the ridi|culous Speaker. Pride makes a Man di&s;cover his Knowledge, and con&s;equently his Ignorance, at once; but Mode&s;ty, like the blu&s;hing ROSE, only unfolds its Beauties by Degrees, that the World might not be dazzled with all its Charms at one View.</P>
<P>A &s;mattering Knowledge in the SCIENCES has
<PB N="162" REF="200">been look'd upon as a dangerous Thing; it is apt to intoxicate, and make the Head giddy: It is incumbent upon us therefore to drink deep, or ta&s;te not of the Fountains from whence our Know|ledge flows. If we look into the World, we &s;hall &s;ee the bad Effects of little Knowledge; we &s;hall have a full View of CONTROVERSY, and all its noi&s;y Attendants, Anger, Abu&s;e, Detraction, Im|pertinence, In&s;incerity, all enli&s;ted to fight under her Banners, and PRIDE commanding the At|tack. Better would it be, if Men were ingenuous with a little Knowledge, than employ an ex|ten&s;ive Knowledge in order to corrupt Men's Mo|rals, or to the Prejudice of Religion: Better 'tis to know nothing, than to u&s;e a little, or an exten|&s;ive Knowledge, to their eternal Ruin. FOOLS are &s;uffer'd to &s;peak for our Diver&s;ion and Amu&s;e|ment; but learned, or half-learned Fools, that mi&s;apply extraordinary or tolerable Talents, and are actuated by a bad Principle, &s;uch as Pride is, mu&s;t remember, that PRIDE generally goes be|fore a FALL; that it is contemn'd by good Men in this World; and, what is an Aggravation of it,
<PB N="163" REF="201">it is an ABOMINATION to the great JUDGE of Heaven and Earth, both in this World and in that which is to come.</P>
<P>SINCE then none of the before-mentioned Arguments made U&s;e of in the Behalf of PRIDE are &s;ignificant, I &s;hall, as I propo&s;ed in the <HI>&s;econd</HI> Place, con&s;ider two particular SPECIES of Pride, and their EFFECTS, as di&s;tingui&s;hable in human Nature.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t that I &s;hall mention is PRIDE in POWER, which is of an a&s;&s;uming Nature, and thinks that every thing is its Due: It contemns and looks upon all Mankind as its Va&s;&s;als; and con&s;equently, if it meets with Oppo&s;ition, it &s;wells it&s;elf into a Tumor, and, like impri&s;on'd SUL|PHUR and NITRE, when rarified to a great De|gree, it thunders out De&s;truction again&s;t every thing that oppo&s;es its Cour&s;e. SELF generally does, and indeed ought to mingle with all our Actions; and what has been &s;aid of that &s;oft Pa&s;|&s;ion of the human Soul, LOVE, is more appli|cable
<PB N="164" REF="202">to SELF; for it more particularly mingles with Life, and forms the very Soul. But for a Man to &s;hew too great an E&s;teem for SELF, in Exclu&s;ion of all benevolent Affections towards human Nature, and all good Di&s;po&s;itions towards GOD, is in reality to make him&s;elf both IDOL and IDOLATER. Criminal, indeed: 'Tis to &s;et up an Idol, in any Sen&s;e, in oppo&s;ition to the true GOD; but to &s;et up Imperfection again&s;t all po&s;&s;ible Perfection, is to act contrary to common Sen&s;e, and the Dictates which our common Infir|mities &s;ugge&s;t to us.</P>
<P>THIS &s;ort of Pride may truly be reckoned a fal&s;e MIRROR: It magnifies Objects above their natural Magnitude, and makes even the Infirmi|ties of our Nature appear as &s;omething merito|rious; it gives a Glo&s;s and fal&s;e Colouring to every Action, and hinders a Man from thinking like a moral Agent, from &s;peaking like a rational one, and from acting like a CHRISTIAN. A Man of this wrong Turn is &s;upercilious, becau&s;e vain, affected in his Di&s;cour&s;e, and generally &s;peaks
<PB N="165" REF="203">as if he trode in BUSKINS; becau&s;e to talk other|wi&s;e would be falling from his Dignity, and a cri|minal Compliance with the Vulgar: He loves to &s;ee People flock to his LEVEE, becau&s;e that proclaims his Greatne&s;s; and to keep them to dance Attendance a good while, before that he is plea&s;ed to favour them with an Admittance, at once demon&s;trates his Superiority and their De|pendence.</P>
<P>BUT, what is wor&s;t of all, to be favour'd with a gracious SMILE, after &s;ome Years fruitle&s;s At|tendance, is often look'd upon as an hopeful Re|ception; tho' it too often proves a pregnant Evi|dence of his In&s;incerity, and their want of Di&s;|cretion.</P>
<P>THIS Method of acting is generally ob&s;erv'd by the proud Man towards tho&s;e that are not of a much inferior Rank. But if we view him in ano|ther Light, in relation to the Bulk of Mankind, we &s;hall find him their TYRANT, not their BENEFACTOR; he con&s;iders them as made for
<PB N="166" REF="204">his Service, and values them only, as we do BRUTES, for their U&s;efulne&s;s. If they offend him, he rages; if they contradict him, he is fu|rious, and ready to commit the greate&s;t Violence: and, what is wor&s;t of all, he carries his Honour in the Point of his SWORD; not con&s;idering that Humility is the greate&s;t Ornament of Greatne&s;s, and that Humanity exercis'd towards Mankind, that partake of the &s;ame common Nature, that have the &s;ame CREATOR, the &s;ame REDEEMER, and the &s;ame SANCTIFIER, join'd with the &s;ame Pro&s;pect of Happine&s;s, is what becomes every De&s;cendant from ADAM.</P>
<P>BUT if we &s;hift the Scene, and introduce this proud Man under the Character of a FRIEND, we &s;hall find that he is not capable of that Refine|ment, that Delicacy of Soul, which is nece&s;&s;ary to the very Exi&s;tence of Friend&s;hip. Can he throw off that Affectation of Superiority, which, when affected, is generally the DEATH of Friend&s;hip? Can he, in common Conver&s;ation on indifferent Matters, give Ear to a Friend's Advice? Can he
<PB N="167" REF="205">thwart his own Inclination, in order to do him a Plea&s;ure? Can he forgo an Advantage, that he may thereby be &s;erviceable to his Friend? Will he make his Friend's Cau&s;e his own? Will he oblige him, without telling him of the Obligation? Will he connive at his Failings, without making them the Subject of his rude Mirth, and ill-timed Ri|dicule? Will he comfort him in Sickne&s;s; or, when under the Pre&s;&s;ure of adver&s;e Fortune, will he &s;up|port him? Nay, rather, will he not expo&s;e him to a mercile&s;s World; which will &s;coff at Poverty, and &s;neer at human Mi&s;ery; who&s;e Pity is even cruel, and who&s;e Charity, becau&s;e attended with barbarous Reflections, is almo&s;t equal to the Agonies of Death? The Truth is, the proud Man, as he would not chu&s;e to have any upon a Level with him&s;elf, cannot have a true Friend; he may be attended with Sycophants, and &s;uch who&s;e In|tere&s;t it is to keep fair with him; he may have Va&s;&s;als that will give into any criminal Com|pliances in Obedience to an imperious Ma&s;ter; but he is depriv'd of true Friends, who&s;e Coun&s;els are the MEDICINE of Life, who&s;e WOUNDS are
<PB N="168" REF="206">faithful, and who&s;e AFFECTIONS are per|petual.</P>
<P>THE Rea&s;on is, there cannot be an Union of Souls where a Di&s;tance is kept up, and where Men endeavour to maintain an Inequality: Where there is a Di&s;tance, there is Re&s;ervedne&s;s; where there is Re&s;ervedne&s;s, there is want of Confidence; where there is a want of Confidence, there is a want of Sincerity: and when all, or any of the&s;e, are wanting, no real Friend&s;hip can exi&s;t.</P>
<P>THIS is the very Ca&s;e of the proud Man: His Dependants fear him, and, perhaps, hate him; his Equals contemn him, and, if he has Superiors, they make a Je&s;t of him: and this too is owing to his contemptuous Behaviour, and his &s;uppo&s;ed Inequality which he affects towards other Men. Well were it for &s;uch a Man, if he were placed in &s;uch a Situation of Life where he might ta&s;te the Sweets of Friend&s;hip: He would no longer prac|ti&s;e the forbidding A&s;pect, the haughty Ge&s;ture, or the civil Leer; a gentle Softne&s;s would &s;teal
<PB N="169" REF="207">upon him unawares, and make him feel, what he never felt before, Joys at another's Pro&s;perity, and a becoming Di&s;tre&s;s for another's WOES.</P>
<P>BUT the principal Rea&s;on why he is not &s;u&s;ceptible of Friend&s;hip, is, becau&s;e proud and haughty SCORNER is his Name, becau&s;e he dealeth in proud WRATH. As Virtue is the BASIS or Foundation of all true Friend&s;hip, &s;o Vice is the Death of it. Anger, proud Anger e&s;pecially, is a fruitful Source of Ills; it is an Enemy to Truth, Peace, Candour, Benevolence, and, by Con&s;equence, is a mortal Enemy to Friend&s;hip's &s;acred Flame. Friend&s;hip has been call'd a RELIGION that takes its Source from the fir&s;t, and points, like it to HEAVEN, and almo&s;t in this Scene of Mi&s;ery antidates its Bli&s;s. Mi&s;erable then mu&s;t be the Condition of this proud Man without this BALSAM of Life; becau&s;e Health is reckon'd a DISEASE, Life DEATH, without the agreeable Society of a Friend.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="208">BUT of this, and &s;ome other Effects, I &s;hall &s;peak, GOD willing, at &s;ome other Time.</P>
<P>NOW to GOD the FATHER, the SON, and the HOLY GHOST, be a&s;crib'd, as is mo&s;t due, all Honour and Prai&s;e, Might, Maje&s;ty, and Do|minion, NOW and for EVERMORE.</P>

For it may be ob&s;erv'd as an invariable Maxim, that a Man that has not good Principles in Morality, can never have good ones in Religion; and Re|ligion, on the contrary, enforced by proper Sanc|tions, is the be&s;t Cau&s;e of good Morals. The proud Man then cannot be a good RELIGION|IST, becau&s;e a bad MORALIST; and cer|tainly, from the Contempt of his Neighbour, there is a natural and ea&s;y Tran&s;ition to the Contempt of the GOD that made him: And 'tis no wonder, on the contrary, that if he de&s;pi&s;es his MAKER and PRESERVER, he, by con&s;equence, will de|&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e of the &s;ame Species with him&s;elf. And if a Man will work him&s;elf up to &s;uch a Pitch of Wickedne&s;s as to think meanly of GOD'S Handi|works, we may ea&s;ily conclude, that whatever comes from GOD will afford Matter for Ridicule to the proud Man. To be a proud Boa&s;ter, an haughty dogmatical Dictator, a proud Rea&s;oner,
<PB N="173" REF="211">and an imperious and abu&s;ive Writer, are Ingredi|ents which are almo&s;t, nay, I may venture to add, altogether e&s;&s;ential to the Compo&s;ition of this proud Man.</P>
<P>NO Wonder then, that the Contempt of RE|VELATION is owing to PRIDE, and that for two Rea&s;ons: Either becau&s;e, fir&s;t, the proud Man is guilty of great Immoralities; and then 'tis no Wonder that a Religion, who&s;e Purity forbids all Irregularities of Soul and Body, &s;hould not meet with a good Reception with one that has contracted vicious Habits; and, what is wor&s;t of all, a di&s;hone&s;t Heart. To &s;ubmit to &s;uch a Re|&s;traint; which contradicts the immoderate Sallies of indulg'd Pa&s;&s;ions, and commands him not to &s;et up his HORN, nor a STIFF NECK; and likewi&s;e that he &s;hould not be high-minded, but fear; &s;hews, as he erroneou&s;ly thinks, an abject Meanne&s;s of Soul: not con&s;idering, that to act vi|ciou&s;ly, is to act meanly; and to contemn what GOD has given us for a RULE of Life, is to &s;et up Weakne&s;s in oppo&s;ition to OMNIPOTENCE,
<PB N="174" REF="212">and human Folly in contradiction to infinite WISDOM. Or,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> THIS proud Man de&s;pi&s;es Revelation, becau&s;e he thinks Rea&s;on is able to bring him to Happine&s;s. Now, if we con&s;ider the Strength of human Rea&s;on &s;ince the Fall of Man, we &s;hall find it a bad PILOT; Heathen Ignorance, Heathen Super&s;tition, and Heathen Follies, are a demon&s;tra|tive Evidence of its profound Darkne&s;s: and if it was not &s;ufficient to direct them to an happy Im|mortality, how &s;hould it direct us, &s;ince all are not<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">'Tis allowed by all, that if Man does but act up to REASON, &s;uppo&s;ing no REVELATION from GOD to exi&s;t, he will finally obtain Mercy.

<PB N="175" REF="213">and the Horror of it more horrible. Thus Rea|&s;on, at the &s;ame Time that it affords the Under|&s;tanding a little Light, evidences likewi&s;e its want of it. Can we then be proud of this boa&s;ted Rea&s;on, which is Darkne&s;s, when compared to the Light of the GOSPEL? Or, is it not rea&s;onable that it &s;ubmit to that which GOD has declared, by SIGNS and WONDERS, to be his WILL? Does it not daily prove its own Weakne&s;s, and the Darkne&s;s that it is involv'd in, by a thou&s;and In&s;tances? Is it not daily overturning old HYPO|THESES, and framing new ones? Is it not often lo&s;t in Doubt and Conjecture? And has not DOUBTING been a Science? What has Rea&s;on then in it, that we &s;hould admire it to our De&s;truc|tion? Is not thus to admire it, like preferring a TAPER to the Light of the SUN? Such a Pre|ference brings the romantick DUNGEON into our View, in the Middle of which is a Taper burning, which only di&s;covers the gloomy Horror of the Place, and the Confu&s;ion and indi&s;tinct Appear|ance of Objects: Or rather, it re&s;embles the poe|tical DESCENT into the infernal REGIONS;

Thus is Rea&s;on: It con&s;i&s;ts of Light and Shade; but its &s;hadowy Parts, like tho&s;e of a melancholy Repre&s;entation, are predominant: it &s;ees indi&s;tinct|ly, apprehends &s;lowly, and, for the mo&s;t part, judges erroneou&s;ly. To a&s;cribe then too much to Rea&s;on, in Di&s;paragement of Revelation, not only di&s;covers Pride, but demon&s;trates likewi&s;e the Per|ver&s;ene&s;s, as well as Ignorance, of human Nature. And certainly to glory in that, who&s;e Imperfec|tions the Writings of all Ages fully evince, &s;hews, that one cannot boa&s;t of Weakne&s;s and Infirmities without incurring the Cen&s;ure of having a weak Under&s;tanding.

<PB N="177" REF="217">Act of the UNDERSTANDING preceeds that of the WILL.</P>
<P>THESE are the common Effects of Pride in one &s;ort of Men: But if we take a View of ano|ther &s;ort and its Effects, which I propo&s;ed to treat of, we &s;hall find it the Rever&s;e of the former. This is with great Propriety term'd PRIDE that will LICK the DUST: that is, it will &s;ubmit to a mean unbecoming Behaviour, &s;o that it may, by that Means, rai&s;e it&s;elf to a greater Height. It can be &s;upple and cringing to any that can do it a Ser|vice; but, when the Service is done, it can as rea|dily di&s;avow it: It can appear in any Shape, and be|come all Things to all Men, that it may gain &s;ome to its Intere&s;t: It can, like that cunning greedy Animal, the HYENA, when it wants to make a Prey, &s;eign the di&s;tre&s;s'd Tone of Voice by way of Decoy. It appears under the Ma&s;k of Friend|&s;hip, and di&s;covers it&s;elf in gentle Smiles, obliging Ge&s;tures, and complai&s;ant Profe&s;&s;ions of good Of|fices. Thus the gilded Pill of In&s;inuation goes &s;moothly down, and proves in the End rank Poi|&s;on
<PB N="178" REF="218">to tho&s;e that are &s;o unfortunate as to &s;wallow it: For 'tis certainly true that tho&s;e who are &s;o weak as to &s;uffer them&s;elves thus to be impo&s;ed upon, are ge|nerally contemn'd and ridicul'd by the very Per&s;ons that made U&s;e of them as the In&s;truments of their Ambition. And when we have a full View of &s;uch Per&s;ons in Power, and &s;ee them arriv'd at the Height of their mo&s;t &s;anguine Hopes, we cannot help com|paring them to gaudy BUTTERFLIES, that un|dergo &s;everal Changes of their Condition before they appear in their variegated Plumage; and as the Progre&s;s of the latter thro' their &s;everal States, before they arrive at any tolerable State of Perfec|tion, is abject and grovelling: &s;o, tho&s;e mean Can|didates for Honour and Preferment a&s;cend Step by Step thro' a tedious Chain of Meanne&s;&s;es; and before they can be Men in Power, they mu&s;t be the Tools and In&s;truments of Ambition; and often|times to be thorough-paced VILLAINS is the only Recommendation for them to a POST of HONOUR. Thus mean Conde&s;cen&s;ions and cri|minal Compliances are made, that Men may gain the highe&s;t Spoke in the WHEEL of FORTUNE:
<PB N="179" REF="219">not con&s;idering that &s;uch an Eminence requires a &s;ound Head, and a particular Firmne&s;s of Soul; otherwi&s;e a Giddine&s;s may &s;eize them, and tumble them to the lowe&s;t Spoke, to their own Confu&s;ion, nay, perhaps De&s;truction, and Joy of the gazing Multitude.</P>
<P>BUT this &s;ort of PRIDE is oftentimes more eminently criminal than the former, becau&s;e 'tis particularly guilty of that foul Crime of IN|GRATITUDE. It wears a MASK, till it has gain'd the full Completion of its De&s;ires; but when that is once gain'd, it no longer appears under a borrow'd Shape, but &s;hifts the Scene, and re-a&s;&s;umes the true Character. Hence is it that Riches and Power are &s;aid to di&s;cover the MAN: then he is at Liberty to act as Inclination dictates; whereas before, Narrowne&s;s of Circum&s;tances, and a contracted Sphere of Action, were terrible Ob|&s;tacles in the Ways of Vice. Experience confirms this. If we take a View of Mankind, the younger Part e&s;pecially, that abound in Riches, we &s;hall &s;ee them, not like EPICURUS, given to a con|templative
<PB N="180" REF="220">Life; but, like his FOLLOWERS, im|mers'd in Voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, &s;unk in Plea&s;ure, and &s;wimming down the Current of Inclination. If then you would know Mankind, grant them the full Extent of their Wi&s;hes, and then you will &s;ee a new &s;ort of Inclinations in the Bud, and gra|dually branching them&s;elves out to an immoderate Height, unle&s;s timely check'd in their Growth by Di&s;cretion. So true is the Ob&s;ervation, that the Vices of a great many are not of an enormous Size, becau&s;e they occupy but a low Station in Life. Something &s;imilar to this is produced in the SERPENT: Winter congeals its Poi&s;on, and hinders its malign Influences; but, when the Sum|mer appears, it di&s;&s;olves the Poi&s;on, and makes it pernicious in its Operations. No Wonder then that Pride is the Spawn of Riches and Power, and that Ingratitude takes its Ri&s;e from Pride; &s;ince it thinks it demeans it&s;elf prettily, if it pays or owns an Obligation, e&s;pecially to Per&s;ons of no Figure. It thinks its eminent Station a &s;ufficient Security again&s;t In&s;ult, and that its Riches can ward off any Blow that is aim'd at it on account of its Ingra|titude.
<PB N="181" REF="221">Hence this Vice is the Child of Pride, and nurs'd by Riches. Both of them are to the MIND, what VERNAL SHOWERS are to the EARTH; each contributes to the Nouri&s;hment of its re&s;pective Plants; and at the &s;ame Time that &s;ome of a good Quality thrive, others either un|profitable, or of a noxious Nature, &s;well into an immoderate Size: and it is not &s;urprizing if Ingra|titude &s;hoots up its Head in a luxuriant Soil, when fo&s;ter'd by a genial Warmth. And if it does &s;pring up, as Experience &s;hews it too often does, it proves the mo&s;t dete&s;table of all Vices; becau&s;e to it, as to one common Centre, the other Vices incline: but, more particularly, Breach of Faith, Breach of Friend&s;hip, Inju&s;tice, Oppre&s;&s;ion, and, what is wor&s;t of all, Murder oft concludes the black Catalogue, and &s;huts the di&s;mal Scene. Since there is &s;uch a Connection in Vice, and more emi|nently in this, 'tis no Wonder that the AN|CIENTS honour'd Ingratitude with a particular Mark of Di&s;tinction, to denote at the &s;ame Time the unnatural Offence, and al&s;o their Abhorrence of it.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="222">BUT Ingratitude is not the only Vice that at|tends this &s;ort of Pride. IMPUDENCE, with its HANDMAIDS, Intemperance and Unclean|ne&s;s, are generally Attendants upon it. For Pride in Power cannot brook a Contradiction to its Inclinations; if it &s;hould, it would argue want of Power to compa&s;s what Inclination prompted to: not con&s;idering, that a bad Inclination thwart|ed, tends toward the Conque&s;t of our&s;elves; than which nothing is &s;o difficult, and at the &s;ame Time &s;o honourable. But this &s;ort of Pride generally behaves with the &s;ame inherent Meanne&s;s when in Power, as when in its Ri&s;e; and if it could put off all Mode&s;ty in its Dawnings of Power, it is not &s;trange if it di&s;plays it&s;elf in Scenes of Lewdne&s;s, when Power is added to Inclination.</P>
<P>AND as this &s;ort of Pride is ungrateful and de|bauch'd in its Practice, &s;o is it envious at another's Succe&s;s. Superior Merit either in Action or Con|duct, &s;uperior Fortune, or &s;uperior Titles, or a Prince's Favour, are &s;ufficient Motives to Envy. The De&s;ire of rai&s;ing him&s;elf to the State of Su|periority,
<PB N="183" REF="223">without &s;ufficient Abilities to enable him to do it, is the very Cau&s;e of an envious Man; and the very Knowledge of another's larger Talents, is oft the Object of Envy; becau&s;e &s;ometimes from Superiority of Abilities, one may, with &s;ome De|gree of Certainty, predict another's future Emi|nence in Life. This perhaps might be MORDE|CAI'S Ca&s;e; otherwi&s;e what Rea&s;on had HAMAN to be di&s;compos'd at the Behaviour of a Man &s;o much beneath him. The Rea&s;on indeed is &s;aid to be this; MORDECAI would not pay him a proper Deference; he neither &s;tood up, nor moved for him; therefore was he under HAMAN'S great Di&s;plea&s;ure: and tho' HAMAN enjoyed the greate&s;t Honours, the greate&s;t Riches, and was ble&s;s'd with a Multitude of Children, yet, conti|nued he, all the&s;e avail me nothing &s;o long as I &s;ee MORDECAI &s;itting in the King's Gate. Be|&s;ides the Contempt &s;hewn by this JEW to the King's Prime Mini&s;ter, there mu&s;t be &s;ome other Rea&s;on why this proud Man could not bear a Sight of MORDECAI; he hated him probably for his open Contempt, envy'd him by rea&s;on of his Relation
<PB N="184" REF="224">to the Queen, and becau&s;e he &s;eem'd to have Qualifications &s;ufficient to enable him to &s;upplant HAMAN in the Royal Favour. If this was not the Ca&s;e, why was <HI>Haman</HI>'s Wrath &s;o violent, as not only to thir&s;t after the Blood of MORDECAI, but likewi&s;e the Blood of all the JEWS? A little Contempt, one would imagine, could not do all this; I &s;hould rather &s;uppo&s;e this proud Man painted his own Downfal, and the Ri&s;e of MOR|DECAI, in his Imagination: This melancholy Con&s;ideration might make him envious; Envy would naturally make him hate; and Hatred might hurry him on to de&s;ire the utter Extirpation of the JEWS. Not &s;o the generous SPARTAN; he was glad to know that there were brave Men in the City be&s;ides him&s;elf. Great and good Men have a benevolent Di&s;po&s;ition; and as they are good them&s;elves, they love to &s;ee it in others, and are ready to forward others too in their &s;everal pro|&s;perous Pur&s;uits in Life. Whereas Envy is a bit|ter Enemy to another's Fame; and as in NATU|RAL BODIES there is required a Fitne&s;s to re|flect the Rays of Light; &s;o in the HUMAN
<PB N="185" REF="225">SOUL it is requi&s;ite that there &s;hould be a fit Di&s;|po&s;ition to receive the Brightne&s;s of another's Fame; otherwi&s;e it will be &s;u&s;ceptible of that odious Pa&s;&s;ion, Envy, which generally throws a Shade over the bright Parts of another's Character, like OPAQUE BODIES that &s;uffocate the Rays of LIGHT; and as every SHADOW owes it Birth to Light, &s;o Fame, true Fame e&s;pecially, produces Calumny and Cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>BESIDES the before-mentioned Effects, I might here mention, that Pride is often the Cau&s;e of INFIDELITY; becau&s;e fir&s;t Pride occa&s;ions an Affectation of Singularity, which is wont to take much with &s;uch Per&s;ons as de&s;ire to be di&s;tingui&s;h'd by being thought to have a greater Share of Pene|tration than other Men.</P>
<P>AND, &s;econdly, becau&s;e it rai&s;es a De&s;ire of being independent and uncontroulable by any one. When this meets with Per&s;ons of an imperious Temper, as all proud Men generally are of &s;uch a Temper, it is a &s;trong Temptation to Sceptici&s;m
<PB N="186" REF="226">and Infidelity. But as this would carry me be|yond my pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, I &s;hall, as I propo&s;ed in the <HI>la&s;t</HI> Place, conclude with a &s;hort Exhorta|tion to HUMILITY.</P>
<P>WHEN I recommend this Virtue to the World, I would not be &s;o under&s;tood as to recommend all kinds of Humility. There are two &s;orts, of a de|generate Nature. The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> re&s;pects our Behaviour to Man; to whom we may attribute too much, and too little to our&s;elves. This may be of dan|gerous Con&s;equence to our Integrity; becau&s;e, if we &s;uffer our&s;elves to be directed entirely by others, we may often meet with ill Advi&s;ers, and con&s;e|quently with ill Advice. If, in religious Matters, e&s;pecially where Rea&s;on may be &s;afely appeal'd to, we will not make U&s;e of our own Rea&s;on, but the Rea&s;on of others, 'tis no Wonder that &s;ome among&s;t us make SHIPWRECK of their FAITH, and deny even the LORD that bought them. For the thinking too little, as well as too much of hu|man Rea&s;on, is equally dangerous, and opens
<PB N="187" REF="227">a wide Gap to Errors both of Principle and Practice.</P>
<P>THE <HI>&s;econd</HI> re&s;pects the great Author of our Being, whom &s;ome have painted as enthron'd in terrible Maje&s;ty and Splendor, not to be approach'd in Prayer by any Mortal; and &s;ince he is not im|mediately to be apply'd to, Interce&s;&s;ors have been invented that &s;hould convey their Petitions to the Throne of GRACE. This is degenerating into HEATHENISM, and is an Introduction of a Plurality of Gods; becau&s;e, to apply the Attributes of GOD to Creatures, is to make Gods of tho&s;e Creatures; and con&s;equently is both robbing GOD of his Honour, and likewi&s;e making his Work|man&s;hip upon a Level with him. This Behaviour is particularly inveigh'd again&s;t by St PAUL, when he &s;ays, <Q>Let no Man beguile you of your Re|ward by a voluntary HUMILITY, and wor|&s;hipping of ANGELS.</Q> This Command of the APOSTLE is confirm'd by Rea&s;on; becau&s;e it is ab&s;urd to offer up Prayers to Beings of a li|mited Nature, who can be &s;uppos'd neither om|nipre&s;ent
<PB N="188" REF="228">nor omni&s;cient, and therefore cannot be the proper Objects of our Addre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>TRUE Humility then is of a different Nature from the beforementioned &s;orts; it relates to GOD and our NEIGHBOUR. That which relates to GOD con&s;i&s;ts in a due Sen&s;e of our own Meanne&s;s and his Excellency; which produces in us a lowly and unfeigned Submi&s;&s;ion to his Will: And that which has reference to our Neighbour, con&s;i&s;ts both in having a mean and low Opinion of our|&s;elves, and al&s;o in being content that others &s;hould have &s;o of us: The fir&s;t of the&s;e is contrary to Pride, the other to Vain-glory, which is always an Attendant upon Pride. As the Practice of this Virtue contributes greatly to our pre&s;ent as well as future Happine&s;s; as it comes &s;trongly recom|mended to us by the Doctrine and Example of the BLESSED JESUS, who was meek and lowly of Heart, why &s;hould it be any longer thought a Meanne&s;s to behave with Humility? Dare the proud and haughty SCORNER &s;ay that 'tis MEAN to imitate a GOD? So much every proud Man
<PB N="189" REF="229">avows that will not follow the great Pattern of Humility propos'd in the GOSPEL. Such de|clare them&s;elves not only the Enemies of GOD, but likewi&s;e of Mankind; becau&s;e no human So|ciety can &s;ub&s;i&s;t happily without Humility; and becau&s;e this eminent Virtue is the very Ba&s;is and Support of all as well &s;ocial as religious Virtues.</P>
<P>WHOEVER is humble, is likewi&s;e meek, is benevolent, is beneficent; his Years pa&s;s on with Plea&s;ure, and fly &s;oftly away; being accompanied with the kind Wi&s;hes of his Fellow Creatures, and the plea&s;ing Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of a well-&s;pent Life. The&s;e &s;erve both for Balla&s;t and a plea&s;ing Gale, to waft the HUMAN BARK &s;afe through the Storms of Time, till it arrives at the STILL Ocean of Eter|nity; where SAINTS and ANGELS are ready to HAIL him welcome to the happy and eternal Shore.</P>
<P>WHEREAS Pride is accompanied with Shame and Contempt in this gloomy and melancholy State of Things; and when it has pa&s;s'd the Confines of
<PB N="190" REF="230">this World, it mu&s;t be con&s;ign'd over to tho&s;e un|happy and di&s;mal Man&s;ions, where the PROUD Contemners of Heaven, the Devil and his impious Adherers, re&s;ide in perpetual Angui&s;h.</P>

<P>THE great Virtue &s;o much talk'd of, and &s;o little practis'd in the World, is CHARITY. Every one can reflect on his Neighbour for the Want of it; but when he is to &s;peak charitably him&s;elf of his Fellow-Creatures, and to make Allowances for their &s;everal Failures in Duty, he forgets not only that he is a Man, but that he has, like other Men, the Principles of
<PB N="194" REF="233">CORRUPTION &s;trongly interwoven with his very Nature. Why Men are thus uncharitable, two Rea&s;ons may be particularly a&s;&s;ign'd. PRIDE occa&s;ions it in &s;ome, and Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of GUILT in others. When the proud Man a&s;per&s;es his Neighbour, it is &s;uppo&s;ed that he is innocent him&s;elf of the Crime with which he charges another, and con&s;equently this Di&s;prai&s;e is a tacit Commendation of him&s;elf. None, he thinks, behaves with that &s;trict Honour, Ju&s;tice and Integrity, in the Cau&s;e of Truth, or with greater Piety towards GOD. But he ought to con&s;ider, that if he wants CHA|RITY, which neither envieth, thinketh ill, or is puffed up, he is as &s;ounding BRASS, or as a tinkling Symbol: Each of which is a &s;ufficient Emblem of the proud Man; who&s;e be&s;t Works, becau&s;e tinctur'd with bad Principles, are lighter than VANITY: And as SOUND &s;uppo&s;es Emp|tine&s;s in the SOUNDING INSTRUMENT; &s;o a carping cen&s;orious Temper &s;uppo&s;es a Want of that Charity which is never unea&s;y at another's Good: It &s;uppo&s;es a want of Humanity and Fel|low-&s;eeling for tho&s;e that partake of the &s;ame com|mon
<PB N="195" REF="234">Nature, and a Forgetfulne&s;s that he is &s;ur|rounded with the &s;ame Temptations, and liable to Error and Mi&s;conduct by the importunate Impul&s;es of the &s;ame deprav'd Nature. If the proud Man would look into his own, in&s;tead of his Neigh|bour's Brea&s;t, and there probe with the SWORD of the SPIRIT into every Wound that SIN has made; if he would not &s;hrink at the Scrutiny, but examine to the Bottom of every SORE with Impartiality, he would find &s;o much Need of his healing Art in his own corrupted SELF, as would hinder him from either wounding the Reputation, or making wider Orifices in tho&s;e already wounded. This would learn the proud Man Humility, in&s;tead of an over-weaning Opinion of him&s;elf; and, in|&s;tead of Cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s, a Fear of committing the like Offences with other Men.</P>
<P>BUT tho' Pride is often the Cau&s;e of Unchari|tablene&s;s, yet the Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of GUILT is generally the greate&s;t Cau&s;e of the Want of Cha|rity. Guilt is of a &s;ociable Nature; it loves Com|pany, tho' not perhaps to evidence its Crimes, yet
<PB N="196" REF="235">to give a Countenance to its criminal Behaviour. None would &s;tand alone, or be the BUTT or Talk of a Multitude, e&s;pecially in Things of a &s;hameful Tendency. But when a Number of Men practi&s;e the &s;ame Enormities, they make Vice fa&s;hionable, and therefore le&s;&s;en, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, in the Eye of the World, the Evil, and con&s;equently the Shamefulne&s;s of Sin. For this Rea&s;on it is why we are commanded in SCRIPTURE not to follow a Multitude to SIN. We too naturally conclude, when the generality of Mankind are u|nanimous in the Practice of any one Thing, tho' morally bad, that it is not &s;o evil as repre&s;ented, otherwi&s;e &s;uch Numbers of Men would not unite in the Practice of it. Hence 'tis that &s;uch a gene|ral Practice, if coinciding with the natural Bent of their Tempers, is a great Inducement for others to &s;wim down the &s;ame Stream of Inclination, and to act as if there were no &s;uperintending Ob&s;erver of their Actions. This Society, this Partner&s;hip in Wickedne&s;s, being &s;uch an Alleviation of a Crime, at lea&s;t in the Eye of the wrong-judging World, it is no Wonder that we find Per&s;ons of
<PB N="197" REF="236">bad Conduct prattling about the Malpractices of others. They have, no doubt, &s;ome End to be &s;erv'd by it; and this certainly is the very End they would &s;erve by their Uncharitablene&s;s. They would chu&s;e to have others guilty, at lea&s;t &s;uppo|&s;ed guilty, of the like Meanne&s;&s;es with them&s;elves. To be the only Per&s;ons guilty of Irregularities would be too &s;candalous to be endured with any tolerable A&s;&s;urance. They would be then look'd upon as Enemies to Society, and Men would avoid them for fear of catching the Infection; and at the &s;ame Time that they would be the Objects of Pity, they would likewi&s;e be the Objects of Contempt. But, as I before ob&s;erved, as Society in Wicked|ne&s;s, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, tho' unju&s;tly, palliates the Commi&s;&s;ion of it, hence ari&s;es that grand Mo|tive to Uncharitablene&s;s. Men that are vicious would have others practi&s;e the like Vices; and when they &s;ee others fall away from the peaceable Paths of Wi&s;dom, they immediately conceive an inhuman helli&s;h Joy, and, like DEATH in MIL|TON, grin horribly a gha&s;tly Smile.</P>

I. THEN I am to &s;hew, that every one ought to &s;eek not only his OWN, but his NEIGHBOUR'S Good: And this will be&s;t appear from the Con|&s;ideration of our DEPENDENCE upon one ano|ther. Mutual Wants always &s;uppo&s;e mutual A&s;|&s;i&s;tance. One Man's Deficiency &s;hould be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by another Man's Abundance, whether it re&s;pects the Body or the Mind. If a Man has a plentiful Fortune he ought to con&s;ider it as a Trea&s;ure with which he is intru&s;ted, in order to &s;upply the Wants of his Fellow-Creatures. Or, if he has Wi&s;dom, he may ea&s;ily imagine, it was given him to &s;erve him for &s;ome good End; and no better End can be a&s;&s;ign'd, than the promoting the Good of Society. Wi&s;dom, indeed, is naturally of a communicative Nature, and extends its benign In|fluence, like its great Author, GOD ALMIGHTY, to all around it. The Bad, as well as the Good, find its bene&s;icial Effects, both with regard to their temporal and eternal Intere&s;t. But as their temporal bears no Proportion to their future Inte|re&s;t, 'tis the Bu&s;ine&s;s of a wi&s;e Man to let the LIGHT that he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;hine for the Be|nefit
<PB N="201" REF="240">of his FELLOW-TRAVELLERS, le&s;t they, having their Under&s;tandings darken'd by the Mi&s;ts of Pa&s;&s;ion, might lo&s;e the Way that leads to Hap|pine&s;s. Thus the Ignorance of one Man demands the Aid of another's &s;uperior Wi&s;dom; and it is an Inju&s;tice to deny to him that wants this nece&s;&s;ary Aid, becau&s;e we are commanded, if we have Wi&s;|dom, not to have it to our&s;elves. And the very Notion of its being communicated to us by the FATHER of LIGHTS, &s;uppo&s;es that we ought to imitate the bright Author of it: And the com|municating it in greater Proportion to one than another, &s;uppo&s;es likewi&s;e, that tho&s;e who have it in greater Abundance, &s;hould make up the Defi|ciences by a proper Communication. Neither can we evidence a more grateful Return for this Ble&s;|&s;ing of Wi&s;dom, nor greater Wi&s;dom in our&s;elves, than by employing it in the Service of Virtue and Religion.</P>
<P>BUT our Obligation to con&s;ult our NEIGH|BOUR'S GOOD, will &s;till be more evident, if we con&s;ider that we all partake of one common Na|ture.
<PB N="202" REF="241">The being &s;ubject to the like Infirmities demands a &s;imilar Sympathy of Affection: And this very Sympathy, this rejoicing with tho&s;e that do rejoice, and grieving with tho&s;e that grieve, is &s;urely a &s;trong Argument for the doing our Neighbour all po&s;&s;ible Good; and if it was not given for this End in &s;everal Ca&s;es, it would oc|ca&s;ion our Unhappine&s;s. This Sympathy, which prevails more &s;trongly in &s;ome Con&s;titutions than others, makes us unea&s;y, and con&s;equently un|happy at the Sight of &s;ome particular Objects; and this Unea&s;ine&s;s often continues upon the Re|moval of the Objects, and never de&s;erts us, till it has &s;trongly impell'd us to relieve their Mi&s;ery, and place them in a more happy Condition. If indeed there was not this Impul&s;e, this &s;trong Propen&s;ity in our Natures, many would be forget|&s;ul of the Relations that &s;ub&s;i&s;t between them and their Fellow-Creatures. And not with&s;tanding this inherent Monitor, we too often &s;ind by Experience, that &s;ome are of &s;uch harden'd Di&s;po&s;itions, that neither the Ties of Humanity, Affinity, or Reli|gion, will incline them to Acts of Kindne&s;s, or
<PB N="203" REF="242">even to &s;hew that, which will co&s;t them nothing, BENEVOLENCE.</P>
<P>THE behaviour of &s;ome, however, towards their Fellow-Creatures, ought not to encourage us in the like Cruelty. As we have the &s;ame Infir|mities of Nature, the&s;e very Infirmities &s;hould teach us Compa&s;&s;ion. But this charitable Indul|gence ought no otherwi&s;e to be extended to flagrant Workers of Iniquity, than by Endeavours fir&s;t by gentle Means to recall them from the broad Path that leads to De&s;truction; and in the next Place, if the&s;e LENITIVES fail, CORROSIVES ought to be applied, in order to correct in Time the Gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of their Humours, and the Corruption of their Habits; le&s;t others &s;hould catch the Infec|tion, and be carried, by the Violence of its Stream, into the Ocean of ETERNITY.</P>
<P>TO form Exeu&s;es for &s;uch, and to colour over their Behaviour with artful Glo&s;&s;es, would not be CHARITY, but an evident Demon&s;tration of our own latent Corruptions. It would be inhuman to
<PB N="204" REF="243">palliate them, and prove that we have no Regard either for the pre&s;ent or future Well-being of &s;uch Offenders. Intere&s;t, indeed, that Director of the human Affections, is too often in the&s;e Days the grand Ob&s;tacle to the Performance of this chari|table Duty. It is the grand Motive to a fal&s;e Complai&s;ance, lying FACE, &s;mooth TONGUE, and &s;upple KNEE; all which are u&s;ed at the Ex|pence of Truth, Sincerity, and every thing lau|dable. To tell a Man his Crimes, even with the mo&s;t compa&s;&s;ionate Tenderne&s;s, generally is at|tended with the Criminal's Enmity and Aver|&s;ion. And even to &s;peak Truth in indifferent Matters to &s;ome, is the direct Way to kindle the latent Sparks of Anger, and blow it into Flame. But, in either of the&s;e Ca&s;es, is the Exerci&s;e of the great Law of CHARITY, or the Defence of Truth to be neglected, becau&s;e &s;ome have neither the Virtue nor good Sen&s;e to hear either the one or the other with Patience? Certainly we &s;hould pay a greater Deference to Rea&s;on, Religion, and the Dignity of our own Natures, than to &s;ee UNGOD|LINESS deluging the Earth, without endeavour|ing
<PB N="205" REF="244">to impede its Progre&s;s, or without attempting to dry up &s;uch Overflowings; that will, if permit|ted to &s;pread, affect both the pre&s;ent and future Health of Society.

And as the promoting of the temporal Intere&s;t of our Fellow-Workers is deem'd an Act of Charity; &s;o, by Parity of Rea|&s;on, the a&s;&s;i&s;ting of our Fellow-Travellers to the obtaining an higher Good, eternal in the Heavens, mu&s;t be proportionably a greater Act of Charity; and con&s;equently the Obligation to the Perfor|mance of it mu&s;t likewi&s;e be greater, more weighty, and therefore the Neglect of it the more criminal. But this Charity ought to be exhibited to our Neighbour; becau&s;e,</P>
<P N="2">II. WE never &s;hew a greater Regard for our NEIGHBOUR'S WELFARE, than when we endea|vour to re&s;tore him to a State of GRACE, when he has been overtaken in a FAULT. And this
<PB N="206" REF="245">Regard we may &s;hew in two re&s;pects, both with relation to his Principles and Practice. When the Heart, from whence proceed the I&s;&s;ues of Life or Death, is corrupted, the Stream that flows from it mu&s;t be con&s;equently impure. The Fountain then mu&s;t be purified and refin'd before it can pro|duce &s;alutary Streams; the noxious Qualities which it has contracted, either upon account of its Stag|nation, or by rea&s;on of its having receiv'd un|whol&s;ome Particles from other Bodies, mu&s;t be purged away, and then it will &s;atisfy the thir&s;ty Soul with Good. As the Heart then may be con|&s;idered as a Fountain, where the fir&s;t Principles of Action lye conceal'd; and as, according to the Goodne&s;s or Badne&s;s of tho&s;e Principles, Men pro|ceed to act well or ill: &s;o a &s;trict Guard &s;hould be &s;et over the Heart, le&s;t it &s;hould form Schemes both detrimental to it&s;elf and Society. And as ge|nerally we keep a watchful Eye over a Man that has once deceiv'd us, let his future Profe&s;&s;ions of Honour be what they will; &s;o likewi&s;e, as the Heart often deceives us, and has been pronounc'd, by one that knew what was in it, that it is deceit|ful
<PB N="207" REF="246">above all Things, we ought &s;o to attend its in|ward Workings, as to make it produce &s;omething that may advance both our pre&s;ent and future Health. Great Care then ought to be taken when the Heart is young and tender, and therefore &s;u&s;|ceptible of any Impre&s;&s;ion, to &s;tamp only &s;uch Images upon it as will excite not only agreeable, but beneficial Sen&s;ations. When thus the plea&s;ant and profitable are &s;o beautifully united, we may naturally expect a glorious Harve&s;t of corre&s;pond|ing good Actions. But fir&s;t every one ought to encourage none but good Di&s;po&s;itions in his Brea&s;t; otherwi&s;e, like the deaf ADDER, he will not hear the Voice of the CHARMER, charm &s;he never &s;o wi&s;ely. The In&s;tructor that endeavours to &s;ow the SEEDS, the fir&s;t Principles of Goodne&s;s in the Hearts of his Hearers, meets with but very indif|ferent Succe&s;s, when either the Ears of his Au|dience are not di&s;pos'd to hear, or when the Devil has &s;own TARES beforehand in their Hearts.</P>
<P>INSTRUCTION, however, is never more &s;ea|&s;onable than when the Heart is thus corrupted.
<PB N="208" REF="247">Bad Principles ought to be check'd in their Growth, or they will be too luxuriant ever to be entirely eradicated. And if Men will not check them them&s;elves, 'tis Charity in another to admo|ni&s;h them of their Danger, and &s;hew them the Precipice from whence, if &s;uch Principles &s;pring forth into a continued Series of vicious Actions, they mu&s;t unavoidably fall. This is &s;natching a Man out of the Fire, and placing him in a State of Safety; where he will meet with no Di&s;turbance from Con&s;cience, or any Unea&s;ine&s;s from the De|&s;truction of bad Principles.</P>
<P>AND as it is charitable in a PHYSICIAN to pre&s;cribe to a Neighbour that has the Seeds of a dangerous Di&s;ea&s;e latent in his Body, which would, if not timely prevented, have been fatal to him; &s;o, by checking bad Principles by Doctrines which are entirely calculated for the Health of the Soul, we perform a Charity truly chri&s;tian. And as the Charity in a PHYSICIAN is &s;till greater when he extend his Care to a Fellow-Creature, when the Di&s;ea&s;e threatens the Di&s;&s;olution of Soul and Body;
<PB N="209" REF="248">&s;o likewi&s;e is our Charity proportionably greater, when we re&s;tore a Man to a State of GRACE from a total Depravation of Mind, and a con&s;e|quent Commi&s;&s;ion of Wickedne&s;s with Greedine&s;s. 'Tis ju&s;tly reckon'd a charitable Action to deliver a Man, who&s;e Life and Goods were in Danger, from ROBBERS, or from the grinding Oppre&s;&s;i|on of Men of &s;uperior Fortune: As the Cha|rity is great in this Ca&s;e, &s;o likewi&s;e it is greater to be freed from that mo&s;t cruel and tyrannical of all Enemies, SIN. It robs us of our pre&s;ent Peace, and makes us forfeit our future Expecta|tion in the Man&s;ions of the JUST. For it is im|po&s;&s;ible that we &s;hould, if we practi&s;e every thing but what is commanded in the GOSPEL, be ever at Peace with our&s;elves; and if we are not at Peace in our own Brea&s;ts, how is it po&s;&s;ible for us to be at Peace with our CREATOR? This Con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of Guilt, amid&s;t the greate&s;t Affluence, makes the Heart &s;ad; Wine cannot entirely overcome it, nor Company divert it. And to hear others prais'd for Excellencies, which we are con&s;cious we have not, is a great Mortification: 'Tis a tacit
<PB N="210" REF="249">Admonition, that we &s;hould fill up the Blanks we have made in Life with a &s;teady active Virtue, and eradicate tho&s;e great De&s;troyers of our's and our Neighbour's Peace, the SEEDS of VICE.</P>
<P>AND if any one who &s;ees our Pain ari&s;ing from the Practice of Guilt, &s;hould charitably interpo&s;e, and &s;hould mediate Peace between us and Heaven; &s;uch Kindne&s;s would demon&s;trate both his HU|MANITY and al&s;o his CHRISTIANITY. But charitable Advice is too often rejected with Di&s;|dain; either becau&s;e the Advi&s;er is generally look'd upon as &s;uperior, at lea&s;t in Wi&s;dom, to the Per|&s;on advis'd; or, becau&s;e the Manner in which the Advice is convey'd to us is di&s;agreeable. In the former of the&s;e Ca&s;es, when Men think it a Di&s;|credit to their Under&s;tandings to be in&s;tructed, as too many are over-wi&s;e in their own Conceits, there &s;eems to be no better Method u&s;ed, in order to bring &s;uch to their right Minds, than by &s;eem|ing to allow them SENSE; and then, in all proba|bility, they would admit Truths to de&s;cend into their Hearts, which, if deliver'd in an authoritative
<PB N="211" REF="250">Manner, might have di&s;plea&s;ed. To dictate there|fore to others magi&s;terially is the Way to rai&s;e their Aver&s;ion; and con&s;equently will make them rather di&s;pute the Truth of what we &s;ay, than hum|bly acknowledge the Ju&s;tne&s;s of our Sentiments. But to u&s;e the Spirit of Meekne&s;s, and to &s;hew at the &s;ame Time that we are intere&s;ted in the Beha|viour of Offenders, and that we cannot &s;ee them act counter to their pre&s;ent and future Intere&s;t without the greate&s;t Concern, is &s;uch a melting, &s;uch an irre&s;i&s;table Charm, that it di&s;&s;olves the ob|&s;tinate harden'd Offenders into a tender Concern, at lea&s;t for a Time, for their mi&s;erable Circum|&s;tances. Some indeed are not to be wrought upon but by Severity: A candid compa&s;&s;ionate Rebuke only paves the Way for a ridiculous Je&s;t; or makes them &s;hew, what is a Scandal to a rational Being; an heedle&s;s Unconcernedne&s;s. For this Rea&s;on we ought to deal with them as with NATURAl BODIES: Tho&s;e of a &s;oft Compo&s;ition, and le&s;s firm Texture, we generally di&s;&s;olve by a &s;mooth, yet &s;ubtle penetrating FLUID; but tho&s;e, who&s;e

<P>BUT the Spirit of MEEKNESS, generally &s;peaking, is the propere&s;t Means for recovering of Offenders from a State of Sin, and we are under an Obligation to u&s;e it; becau&s;e,</P>
<P N="3">III. and <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> ALL of us may, &s;ome Time or other, &s;tand in need of the like charitable Behavi|our. As we are all frail by Nature, and have the SEEDS of CORRUPTION born with us, it is no Wonder that tho&s;e Seeds, con&s;idering that the be&s;t of us are not always upon our Guard, &s;pring into Action. And if we ob&s;erve farther, that Ob|jects
<PB N="213" REF="252">are to the&s;e Seeds implanted in the Mind, what HEAT is to GRAIN &s;own in the Earth; where in each Ca&s;e the Seeds are invigorated with Life, and produce Fruit in proportion to the Strength or Weakne&s;s of their re&s;pective Cau&s;es; we may from thence conclude, that, con&s;idering the evil Tendency, or the real or &s;uppo&s;ed Charms of &s;urrounding Objects, we may ALL ea&s;ily fall from our Integrity. The Command given to tho&s;e who &s;tand, that is, who &s;till combat Sin, and are active in the Cau&s;e of Virtue, that they take HEED le&s;t they FALL, &s;uppo&s;es not only a Po&s;&s;i|bility, but a Probability, that the be&s;t Men may yield to the &s;welling Tide of &s;ome predominant Affection, and commit the Sin which mo&s;t ea&s;ily BESETS them. As Men are thus liable to give way to the Deceitfulne&s;s of Sin, &s;uch Pronene&s;s to it &s;hould teach us CANDOUR towards others, and &s;hould incite us to &s;et a Guard over our own Hearts.

As a perfect un&s;inning Obe|dience cannot be expected from any; &s;o no Man, for that Rea&s;on, ought to act inhumanly towards tho&s;e who actually fall away in the Day of Temp|tation. And &s;uppo&s;e Men were entirely perfect that rebuke others, yet their Perfection would not ju&s;tify proud Wrath towards others. The Per&s;ons thus treated might imagine, that they are treated roughly; not &s;o much becau&s;e they have been guilty of Breaches in their Conduct, but becau&s;e tho&s;e who &s;everely reflect upon them &s;atisfy there|by a peevi&s;h Moro&s;ene&s;s of Temper; or would &s;hew, what is di&s;ta&s;teful and odious to every one, SUPERIORITY.</P>
<P>OUR BLESSED SAVIOUR, in this Cafe, is a noble Pattern for our Imitation. Tho' he him|&s;elf was entirely exempted from Imperfections ne|ce&s;&s;arily attending other Men; yet HE, who jud|ged not according to Man's Judgment, nor acted
<PB N="215" REF="254">after the &s;ame partial &s;elfi&s;h Manner, behaved with the utmo&s;t Candour, Tenderne&s;s, Benevolence.

<P>AS HE knew what was in Man, HE knew how to induce him to enter into HIS Service, and make him fight manfully under HIS Ban|ners. HE, in order the more effectually to ad|vance the pre&s;ent as well as future Peace of Of|fenders, gave them the mo&s;t engaging Invitations. If they would only believe in HIM, and live a|greeable to that Belief, HE told them, that not only Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins, but an Inheritance in Heaven, would be the happy Con&s;equence of &s;uch a Faith and &s;uch a Practice. And this HE told them with the greate&s;t Gentlene&s;s, Compa&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="216" REF="255">Affection. But notwith&s;tanding that in general HE was MEEK; yet, when he had to deal with Men that were grown ob&s;tinate in Wickedne&s;s, &s;uch as the haughty SCRIBE, or hypocritical PHARISEE, who would neither embrace his Doctrine, nor let others be admitted into a State of Salvation, HE then could &s;hew a becoming Warmth and Re&s;entment; and denounce, what will always be the Con&s;equence of Impenitence and Unbelief, WOE.</P>
<P>SHALL GOD-MAN then behave with the ut|mo&s;t CANDOUR towards offending human Na|ture: and &s;hall we, who partake of the &s;ame fal|lible Nature, forget that Nature, and judge every Man uncharitably; not con&s;idering that by &s;uch Judgment we endanger our own Salvation? And be&s;ides judging uncharitably, &s;hall we who &s;tand in need of the humane compa&s;&s;ionate Sentiments of others, not only judge, but condemn others unmercifully?

SOFT WORDS <HI>turn away</HI> WRATH, <HI>but</HI> GRIEVOUS WORDS <HI>&s;tir up</HI> ANGER.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE Words convey to us an im|portant Le&s;&s;on for the conducting of that mo&s;t unruly of all Members, the TONGUE. We are taught here what particular &s;ort of Words to u&s;e in order to mollify Men that are in WRATH. They are called SOFT WORDS from the Effect which they produce in the Hearts of tho&s;e who are vehemently heated with Pa&s;&s;ion; for the Word WRATH implies a Degree of Rage and Madne&s;s, inciting to Revenge: But this Rage, this Madne&s;s, this De&s;ire of Revenge, may be
<PB N="224" REF="261">ea&s;ily conquer'd at the Expence of a few &s;oft Words. But what &s;ort of Words may be proper|ly term'd SOFT WORDS, may not be &s;o pro|perly determin'd. We may, however, from our Ob&s;ervation upon the different Effects which dif|ferent Expre&s;&s;ions produce in the Minds of Men, probably arrive at their Meaning. We find then by Experience, that if we have excited the Pa&s;&s;ion of ANGER, or the Exce&s;s of it, WRATH, in any Per&s;on, by a real or &s;uppos'd Injury, the be&s;t Way to conquer &s;uch Danger, or &s;uch Wrath, is by u&s;ing &s;uch Words as denote our Sorrow and De&s;ign of making Reparation for the Injury given. This Method of proceeding generally melts the mo&s;t &s;avage Minds into Tenderne&s;s and humane Senti|ments, and di&s;arms them of that furious Spirit upon Anger and Wrath.</P>
<P>AND as &s;oft &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Expre&s;&s;ions turn away Wrath; &s;o, on the contrary, grievous Words &s;tir up Anger. By GRIEVOUS WORDS are meant all bitter Reflections, whether ju&s;t or unju&s;t; all
<PB N="225" REF="262">Abu&s;e, Detraction, and whatever Words have a natural Tendency to excite the Pa&s;&s;ion of Anger in tho&s;e Per&s;ons we either conver&s;e with, or whom we make the Subjects of our Di&s;cour&s;e. The Term GRIEVOUS may &s;ignify too, all Hints or Inuendoes &s;ugge&s;ted to a Neighbour's Prejudice, all ill-natur'd and ill-timed Je&s;ts, and every unkind and unprovok'd Har&s;hne&s;s of Expre&s;&s;ion. But le&s;t this inoffen&s;ive Menner of Behaviour &s;hould &s;eem to many only prudential, rather than Matter of &s;trict Duty, I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. THE Rea&s;onablene&s;s; and,</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. THE Nece&s;&s;ity of u&s;ing SOFT WORDS.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>BUT before I proceed to &s;hew the Rea&s;onable|ne&s;s of them, I &s;hall previou&s;ly ob&s;erve what the Terms SOFT WORDS do not mean. <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> then, they do not mean that we &s;hould u&s;e &s;mooth flat|tering Speeches, in order to deceive the unwary, or with a View to promote our particular Intere&s;t to the Detriment of our Neighbours; either with re|gard
<PB N="226" REF="263">to their moral and religious Character, or with relation to what many value more than the two former, their FORTUNES. Neither, <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> ought any one to imagine that 'tis lawful to avert the Pa&s;&s;ion of Anger at the Expence of Truth. TRUTH generally, as Truth, does not often of|fend, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of an ingenuous Turn of Mind. 'Tis commonly the Manner of &s;peaking of the Truth which gives the Offence. If then we mu&s;t &s;peak the Truth to an angry Per&s;on, we &s;hould deli|ver it without Har&s;hne&s;s; e&s;pecially if it be an un|grateful Truth; and with all the Signs of Sincerity, Compa&s;&s;ion, and Affection. This Manner of Be|haviour has, without Doubt, a great Influence over tho&s;e who, if har&s;hly treated in their Wrath, would have contemn'd the Advice, notwith&s;tanding the Goodne&s;s of it, upon the Account of the Impru|dence of the Advi&s;er. There is a particular Art, which every one is not Ma&s;ter of, in preparing the Mind of an angry Per&s;on for the Reception of Truth. For we mu&s;t not deal with angry Per&s;ons as with Men in their Sen&s;es: We &s;hould rather deal with them as with tho&s;e unhappy Per&s;ons
<PB N="227" REF="264">confin'd in BEDLAM, who are not told of the Cau&s;es of their Di&s;order, for fear of increa&s;ing it; but are led gently to other Subjects, which &s;oftens their &s;avage Fiercene&s;s for a while, makes them methodize their Ideas, and to forget, for a Time, that they are mad. Thus, as POETS dream, Souls in a State of Mi&s;ery, in the infernal Regions, were charm'd with ORPHEUS'S Mu&s;ick in &s;uch a Manner as to forget, for a while, what they could vehemently wi&s;h to forget for ever, INEX|PRESSIBLE TORMENT.</P>
<P>IF therefore we thus artfully and gently deal with angry Per&s;ons, we &s;hall &s;oon &s;often their Di&s;|po&s;itions, and melt their &s;avage Fiercene&s;s into Humanity; and when their Minds are thus &s;often'd, they become capable of any good Im|pre&s;&s;ion that we are pleas'd to &s;tamp upon them: Truth then, tho' dre&s;s'd in &s;omewhat di&s;agreeable Colours, may have a free Pa&s;&s;age into their Minds, and occa&s;ion, what is effected in every ingenuous Mind, a Reformation from Error.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="265">NOR ought we, <HI>thirdly,</HI> to turn away the Wrath of an angry Per&s;on, by &s;uch Expre&s;&s;ions as either give them Hopes, or di&s;cover to him the Means of avenging-him&s;elf of tho&s;e that have oc|ca&s;ion'd his Wrath. This only cures one Ill by the Commi&s;&s;ion of a greater. For when Wrath is &s;ettled into Hatred, Malice, and a De&s;ire of Revenge, &s;uch Rancour is not to be cured by any Expre&s;&s;ions whatever. And he who has &s;ooth'd this Pa&s;&s;ion of Anger, by exciting that helli&s;h Di&s;ea&s;e of the Mind, MALICE, de&s;erves &s;o well of Mankind, as to merit the utter Exclu&s;ion from all the happy Advantages accruing from Society.</P>
<P>HAVING thus premi&s;ed what the Terms SOFT WORDS do not mean, I &s;hall proceed, as I propos'd in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Place, to &s;hew their REASONABLENESS.</P>
<P>AND this I &s;hall do by con&s;idering that 'tis the be&s;t Means of promoting our temporal Concerns, and of procuring what cannot be obtain'd by a
<PB N="229" REF="266">contrary Practice, HEALTH of Body, and PEACE of Mind.</P>
<P>AND, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> the U&s;e of SOFT WORDS will make us more &s;ucce&s;sful in our temporal Affairs.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be allowed, that what gains us Re|&s;pect and E&s;teem will con&s;equently procure us Credit; and therefore mu&s;t naturally make our Af|fairs pro&s;perous. Smooth &s;oft Words, when u&s;ed out of no &s;elf-intere&s;ted View, but out of a Prin|ciple of Duty, have properly Benevolence for their Cau&s;e; and when Men do talk from &s;uch a Principle, it may then be&s;t appear, when they can|not po&s;&s;ibly gain any Advantage to them&s;elves be|&s;ides the Satisfaction of having done their Duty. When Men thus behave with Gentlene&s;s, Meek|ne&s;s, Moderation, and Ju&s;tice, the World in gene|ral is prejudiced in their Favour; and becau&s;e they hear with Meekne&s;s what is propo&s;ed to them, and are impartial in their Determinations in doubt|ful Ca&s;es &s;ubmitted to their Deci&s;ion, they are com|monly pitch'd upon for Arbitrators: A Charac|ter
<PB N="230" REF="267">this, which always &s;uppo&s;es &s;uperior Abilities, Wi&s;dom, Integrity, Meekne&s;s. For, without Meekne&s;s, a Man might provoke, or be provok'd, by har&s;h unguarded Expre&s;&s;ions, to make the Breach, which ought to have been healed up, much wider. But when each Side of the Que&s;tion is heard with Patience, and the Parties concerned &s;ee that a &s;trict Scrutiny is made into the Merits of the Cau&s;e, without any Favour or Affection, they &s;ubmit to the Determinations of &s;uch hone&s;t Men without Anger, Murmuring, or Repining. But before Men can attain this happy compos'd Temper of Mind, &s;everal Difficulties are to be conquer'd. SELFISHNESS, the Cau&s;e of al|mo&s;t every Meanne&s;s in the human Soul, is gene|rally the Rea&s;on why there is little Benevolence in the World. It gives the Mind a narrow contract|ed Way of Thinking. It makes a Man think much of him&s;elf, but little of others. This makes &s;uch Men carele&s;s in their Behaviour towards other, tho' at the &s;ame Time they are fretful and pa&s;&s;ionate if a particular Deference is not paid to
<PB N="231" REF="268">them&s;elves. How then mu&s;t we act towards Men of this wrong Turn? Mu&s;t we humour their Pride, and &s;ooth their Vanity? May we tickle their Imaginations with the &s;ofte&s;t Expre&s;&s;ions that Fancy can invent? Mu&s;t we not rather &s;peak the Truth with Soberne&s;s, Gentlene&s;s, Meekne&s;s? And will not &s;uch behaviour demon&s;trate our own Integrity, and greater Affection for them? Soft Words, or gentle Expre&s;&s;ions, we may u&s;e without degenerating into Flattery; and though other, thro' a proud &s;elfi&s;h Temper, do not plea&s;e to &s;peak well of us, and treat us with &s;uch common Complai&s;ance and Civility as is due to Mankind, yet let not us behave with the &s;ame Meanne&s;s: We mu&s;t remember not only that we are Men, but Men too that profe&s;s CHRISTI|ANITY; and then we cannot fail of wi&s;hing even our Enemies well, and of doing them, when in our Power, what will demon&s;trate the Sincerity of our Wi&s;hes, all manner of Good. This Softne&s;s of Behaviour under ill Treatment mu&s;t always gain us Re&s;pect among&s;t tho&s;e of ingenuous Minds, and con&s;equently mu&s;t, in proportion to our E|&s;teem,
<PB N="232" REF="269">advance our hone&s;t Schemes in the World.</P>
<P>BUT the Advantage of this Softne&s;s of Action will be better illu&s;trated by con&s;idering the Di&s;ad|vantage that the contrary Character labours under.</P>
<P>IMAGINE then a man of rough unpoli&s;h'd Manners, haughty, fierce, pa&s;&s;ionate, dogmatical, and incapable of bearing any Contradiction; and you will &s;oon, without any He&s;itation, conclude, that &s;uch a Character is neither amiable, nor produc|tive of its own, nor the Peace and Well-being of any Society. 'Tis not an au&s;tere Look, an haugh|ty Tone of Voice, boi&s;terous or pa&s;&s;ionate Ex|pre&s;&s;ions, that command Re&s;pect, and give Suc|ce&s;s to our Affairs. The&s;e Qualifications may excite Fear, and, what is wor&s;e, Hatred; may provoke the be&s;t and mo&s;t faithful Friends to de|&s;ert us, and betray our Secrets; and con&s;equently may di&s;concert our be&s;t contriv'd and deep-laid Schemes. This is not founded on FANCY, but on a &s;urer Foundation, EXPERIENCE. Men
<PB N="233" REF="270">are not naturally of &s;uch flexible Tempers as to bend to our Injunctions, when either imperiou&s;ly or har&s;hly commanded. And as with regard to NATURAL POWERS, the Effects will be always like their Cau&s;es; &s;o in MORALS, generally &s;peaking, Cau&s;es and Effects are &s;imilar. An an|gry Per&s;on will produce the &s;ame Pa&s;&s;ion in ano|ther, and one Injury begets another; &s;o that we may from hence conclude, that the humane, not the rough Treatment, gains us Friends, and con|&s;equently gives Succe&s;s to our Affairs.</P>
<P>AND as a humane, candid Di&s;po&s;ition, exhi|bited in Words and Actions, makes us more &s;uc|ce&s;sful in the World, &s;o does it promote the Health of Body and Soul.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be granted, that whatever keeps the Blood and Animal Spirits in a continued equal Motion, mu&s;t have a great Tendency towards the Pre&s;ervation of the Body. That Meekne&s;s pro|duces this Effect, every one who has experienced its contrary, can be&s;t tell. Violent Motions of
<PB N="234" REF="271">the Blood and Spirits &s;hake the Animal Oeconomy, di&s;tend the Ve&s;&s;els, excite Pain, bring on Di&s;ea&s;es, and, what is wor&s;e, often occa&s;ion &s;udden Death: Whereas Meekne&s;s and humane Di&s;po&s;itions keep tho&s;e Springs of Life in a regular Flow, which, con&s;equently, add Vigour to the Body; and, what one would think might recommend it to the Accept|ance of all, it naturally produces Health and long Life: So true is the Ob&s;ervation of our SAVIOUR, that <Q>Ble&s;&s;ed are the Meek, for they &s;hall inherit the EARTH.</Q> They &s;hall enjoy the Earth, be|cau&s;e their Bodies receive no rude Shocks from the Storms of Pa&s;&s;ion; and becau&s;e all is Harmony, Peace, and Love within.</P>
<P>AND as Meekne&s;s, or Softne&s;s of Behaviour is the Body's Health, &s;o does it promote the Peace and Serenity of Mind. Meekne&s;s is always pro|ductive of good Actions; from hence ari&s;es a &s;ecret and agreeable Satisfaction in the Mind. For it always &s;uppo&s;es PATIENCE; and, what &s;hould always be a prevailing Principle in every Indivi|dual, BENEVOLENCE: It &s;uppo&s;es too a Rea|dine&s;s
<PB N="235" REF="272">to hear, a Willingne&s;s to &s;peak, and a Pronene&s;s to lend a helping Hand to all one's Fellow-Creatures. When any are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this amiable Quality, which indeed is a Complication of good Qualities, becau&s;e it cannot exi&s;t without other Virtues; they mu&s;t be ea&s;y, chearful, and, becau&s;e plea&s;ed with them&s;elves, they mu&s;t be con&s;equently pleas'd with others. What agree|able Sen&s;ations this Behaviour mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily ex|cite in the Mind, the Pa&s;&s;ionate may tell with SIGHS, and lament the Want of it with SORROW. They know what Angui&s;h attends a Life dedica|ted to the wild impetuous Sallies of ungovern'd Pa&s;&s;ions. Pain they mu&s;t receive on account of Indecenies committed in the&s;e Heats, and additi|onal Pain too from the Ob&s;ervation and Judgment of the &s;en&s;ible and &s;erious Part of Mankind. But the con&s;cious Plea&s;ure, the HEART-FELT JOY, ari&s;ing from the benevolent Affections, from Meek|ne&s;s, Forbearance, Long-&s;uffering, and Brotherly-kindne&s;s, are Plea&s;ures, far unlike tho&s;e of the Body; which always plea&s;e, and never &s;atiate;
<PB N="236" REF="273">give real Satisfaction, becau&s;e lawful, and proceed|ing from a Sen&s;e of Duty; and are la&s;ting, be|cau&s;e rational. The&s;e Advantages, re&s;ulting from an uniform Softne&s;s of Behaviour, may be &s;uffici|ent, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, to prove the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of u&s;ing SOFT WORDS. The Nece&s;&s;ity of u&s;ing them is what I propo&s;ed in the next Place to con|&s;ider.</P>
<P>UNDER the foregoing Head I have &s;poke par|ticularly concerning the Advantages of MEEK|NESS; becau&s;e whoever is of a meek, mild Di&s;|po&s;ition, mu&s;t con&s;equently be remarkable for an agreeable Softne&s;s of &s;peaking and acting. The Nece&s;&s;ity of which I &s;hall &s;hew, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> from the In|ju&s;tice of RETALIATION; and, in the <HI>next</HI> Place, from the Con&s;ideration of a FUTURE STATE.</P>
<P>AND, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> with re&s;pect to the Unlawfulne&s;s of RETALIATION. When an angry Per&s;on at|tacks us with unju&s;t Reproaches, and lays Things to our Charge that we know not; nay, let his
<PB N="237" REF="274">Charges be ju&s;t or unju&s;t, the Que&s;tion is, whe|ther we ought to an&s;wer him with the &s;ame Sharpne&s;s, or to endeavour, by &s;oft Words, and the milde&s;t Addre&s;s, to humanize this Savage into Man? This Que&s;tion may ea&s;ily be &s;olv'd both from Rea&s;on and Revelation. Men, while they continue in a Pa&s;&s;ion, throw out their Arrows, even BITTER WORDS; but whil&s;t they re|main in this State, they are ju&s;tly term'd MAD|MEN, becau&s;e they are depriv'd of Rea&s;on, and con&s;equently are not worthy our Attention or Di&s;plea&s;ure. But as, in the HUMAN BODY, the Acrimony of the Blood and Juices are cor|rected by &s;oft LENIENT MEDICINES; &s;o that Pa&s;&s;ion of ANGER, that &s;hort-liv'd Madne&s;s, is &s;oone&s;t compos'd, either by SILENCE, or by An&s;wers deliver'd with GENTLENESS. And if we are unju&s;tly accu&s;ed of any Thing ba&s;e in the Heat of Pa&s;&s;ion, and Crimes are laid to our Charge that we know not, &s;ince our Con&s;ciences accu&s;e us not, why &s;hould we be di&s;turbed? Why &s;hould we regard a MADMAN? Retaliation in &s;uch a Ca&s;e would be an Argument of Guilt ra|ther
<PB N="238" REF="275">than of Innocence: It would be a plain Proof, that we pay a greater Deference to the cor|rupt Practice of Human Nature, than to the pure Dictates of unprejudiced Rea&s;on, or to the more refin'd and beneficial Injunctions of an infallible GOD.</P>
<P>BESIDES, as Virtue con&s;i&s;ts in the due regu|lating of our Conduct according to Rea&s;on and Revelation; &s;o to &s;uffer our&s;elves to be hurried away by the violent Stream of Pa&s;&s;ion at the hearing of another's angry unju&s;t Expre&s;&s;ions, is not Virtue, but the Extreme of it. True Heroi&s;m con&s;i&s;ts in BEARING and FORBEARING; in bearing Injuries, and in forbearing from Revenge; and after this Plan the CHRISTIAN HERO is to be form'd. 'Tis true, human Nature &s;trongly pre&s;|&s;es forward for Revenge; but 'tis brave, 'tis God|like to correct the Errors of that Nature; and to demon&s;trate, by our peaceable Behaviour, that GOD is WITHIN us of a Truth.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="276">AND from Revelation it &s;till more evidently appears, that we ought not to return Injury for Injury; but, on the contrary, we are commanded to return GOOD for ILL, and BLESSING for CURSING. For if our BRETHREN (for all Men in an exten&s;ive Sen&s;e are our Brethren) &s;hould offend &s;even Times, or &s;eventy Times &s;even in a Day, it is our Duty to forgive them. To FOR|GIVE them, did I &s;ay? Nay, more, we mu&s;t PRAY for them; and forward, by all Means po&s;&s;ible, their Salvation. But is this the Practice of the World? Are Men &s;low to Wrath, and ready to make Allowances for another's Failings? Are they compa&s;&s;ionate, tender-hearted, forgiving? If this be not the Ca&s;e, why do we profe&s;s Chri|&s;tianity? Why do we enli&s;t our&s;elves as Soldiers under CHRIST'S Banners, if we will not execute his ju&s;t Commands? To act thus, re&s;embles JUDAS, who profe&s;s'd him&s;elf CHRIST'S Di&s;|ciple, that he might the more effectually betray the LORD of Life: Or, 'tis like the Man, who, after he was told what he &s;hould do to be &s;aved, went away &s;orrowful; becau&s;e he could not enjoy
<PB N="240" REF="277">his pre&s;ent Grandeur, and an eternal Crown of Glory in Rever&s;ion.</P>
<P>BUT tho&s;e Men are of wor&s;e Di&s;po&s;itions, who are angry upon every &s;light Occa&s;ion, who are furious for a Trifle, and would kill their be&s;t Friends for the lea&s;t Indi&s;cretion. But this Tem|per is incon&s;i&s;tent both with the Happine&s;s of Society, and likewi&s;e with the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that happy Place, where all is Harmony, Peace, and Love: Which leads me to con&s;ider, what I pro|pos'd, <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> that a mild forgiving Di&s;po&s;ition is the nece&s;&s;ary Preparative for a FUTURE STATE.</P>
<P>HEAVEN is de&s;cribed to be a Place where nothing but LOVE, and its Kindred-Virtues, can enter. Where Pride, Envy, Hatred, Malice, Anger, Wrath, Debate, and Contention, are eter|nally excluded. GOD is &s;aid to be LOVE, not only becau&s;e his Love is extended to all his Works; but becau&s;e he admits no Soul living to enjoy him, but &s;uch as has perfected it&s;elf by LOVE in this
<PB N="241" REF="278">State of Probation. 'Twas LOVE that created; 'tis LOVE that pre&s;erves; and 'twas LOVE that redeem'd a mi&s;erable World. And if we con&s;ider what keeps the HEAVENLY BODIES in per|petual Harmony, we &s;hall find it to be ATTRAC|TION, which is only another Name for LOVE. What is it that unites each Cla&s;s of BEINGS but LOVE? And even in INANIMATE BODIES, what is it that occa&s;ions &s;uch Cohe&s;ion of Parts, &s;uch Union, Regularity, Symmetry, but Attraction, Sympathy, Love? And &s;hall Love, or &s;omething &s;imilar to Love, obtain in the irrational inanimate Creation? And &s;hall Anarchy, Di&s;order, Confu|&s;ion, and every evil Work, prevail among&s;t the la&s;t and be&s;t of GOD'S Works, and the very Heads of the Creation, MEN? A &s;ad Reflection upon REASON this! A Reflection did I &s;ay? Nay, more, 'tis the Di&s;grace, the Death of Rea&s;on; be|cau&s;e &s;uch Behaviour &s;ets human Nature below tho&s;e Beings, which, tho' naturally le&s;s perfect, follow the Laws pre&s;crib'd them by the Author of their Exi&s;tence, GOD ALMIGHTY.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="279">AND &s;ince Love is the uniting Principle of all Things, and the very Cement and Chain by which all Things are link'd together both in HEAVEN and EARTH, why &s;hould we break the Chain, and endanger both our pre&s;ent and future PEACE? Are we not made for Happine&s;s? And is not LOVE made the prime Qualification of that Happine&s;s?</P>
<P>LET us then lay the Foundation of Meekne&s;s, Patience, and Forbearance; and the agreeable Super&s;tructure, LOVE, mu&s;t follow. For unle&s;s we are of a mild forgiving Di&s;po&s;ition, we can have no Love, no Benevolence for our Fellow-Creatures; and the Love of our Fellow-Creatures is made the Mea&s;ure and Standard of our Love to GOD: For if we love not our Brother, that is, our FELLOW-MEN, that we have &s;een, how &s;hall we love GOD that we have not &s;een?</P>
<P>AND as Love is the Principle that characterizes HEAVEN, is it not our Duty to practi&s;e that Vir|tue which will fit us for that peaceable Habitation? Certainly, except we bear the faint Re&s;emblance of
<PB N="243" REF="280">the Divinity, except we keep the LAMP of Life always burning in our Hearts, and except we keep it always &s;hining for the Benefit of our FELLOW-WARRIORS, we &s;hall neither be happy here or hereafter. But if this be in us and abound, we &s;hall not fail of turning away Wrath by &s;oft Words, and a mild gentle Behaviour; and this mu&s;t na|turally gain us the kind Wi&s;hes of the Benevolent, which will &s;erve us as a plea&s;ant Gale to waft our peaceable Souls to that happy State, where the Waves of Life cea&s;e to roar, where the Afflicted cea&s;e from troubling, and the Weary be at REST.</P>
<P>WHICH happy State, that all of us may enjoy, by a meek and patient Behaviour, a Life of Righteou&s;ne&s;s and the Merits of our dear REDEEMER, may GOD of his infinite Mercy grant, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>THE APOSTLE in the&s;e Words gives us an Account of the Manner how this Duty of &s;hewing MERCY to the POOR <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s to be perform'd and practi&s;ed; and that is, with ALACRITY and CHEARFULNESS. &mdash; "He that &s;heweth Mercy, let him do it with Chearful|ne&s;s." &mdash;'Tis not enough to perform a Duty com|manded by GOD; but we mu&s;t likewi&s;e be care|ful of the MANNER of its Performance, that it be done duly, and in &s;uch a Way as is &s;uitable to
<PB N="248" REF="283">it.&mdash; <Q>There is a DECENCY that is to be ob|&s;erv'd even in Liberality to the POOR, which &s;eems to con&s;i&s;t in its being perform'd with &s;uch CHEARFULNESS, as may expre&s;s the God|like Plea&s;ure that is to be met with in obliging our Fellow-Creatures; that may &s;hew Good|nature and Benevolence overflowed; and do not, as in &s;ome Men, run upon the Tilt, and ta&s;te of the Sediments of a grudging uncom|municative Di&s;po&s;ition.&mdash;For &s;ome People, by their Way of con&s;enting to a Benefaction, &s;hall make it lo&s;e its Name; whil&s;t others double the Kindne&s;s and the Obligation: From &s;ome the de&s;ired Reque&s;t drops indeed at la&s;t, but from &s;o doubtful a Brow, that the obliged has almo&s;t as much Rea&s;on to re&s;ent the Manner of be&s;towing it, as to be thankful for the Favour it&s;elf. Others invite with &s;o plea&s;ing an Air, that they &s;eem to meet the Petition half Way, and con&s;ent to a Reque&s;t with a Countenance which proclaims the Satisfaction of their Minds in a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="284"><Q>IN the Practice of every Virtue, there is &s;ome additional Grace required, to give a Claim in excelling in this or that particular Action. A DIAMOND may want poli&s;hing, tho' the Value be &s;till intrin&s;ically the &s;ame; and the &s;ame Good may be done with different Degrees of Lu&s;tre. No Man &s;hould be contented with him&s;elf that he barely does well, but he &s;hould perform every Thing in the be&s;t and mo&s;t be|coming Manner that he is able.</Q>&mdash;When we come into GOD'S Courts to hear his Word, and be in&s;tructed in our Duty, 'tis not enough for us to give unto the Mini&s;ter the hearing of the Ear; but we mu&s;t be careful to hear in a due Manner, with Reverence, with Attention, and without Pre|judice. &mdash;When we &s;pread forth our Hands to|wards Heaven, and open our Mouths in Prayer unto GOD, 'tis not enough that we offer the Mo|tion of our Lips, but we mu&s;t likewi&s;e be careful that our Hearts go along with our Mouths.&mdash;When we fa&s;t and afflict our&s;elves before GOD, 'tis not enough to hang down our Heads like a
<PB N="250" REF="285">BULRUSH, and to &s;pread SACKCLOTH upon our LOINS, to rend our GARMENTS, and &s;mite upon the THIGH; but all this mu&s;t be at|tended with hearty Penitence, with a real Remor&s;e and Compunction of Mind.&mdash;And &s;o likewi&s;e, when we practi&s;e the Duty of ALMSGIVING, when we &s;hew MERCY to the POOR, 'tis not enough for us to extend our Hands to the Indigent, to give of our Bread to the Hungry, or to proffer Drink to the Thir&s;ty, or to cloath the Naked with our Garments, but all this mu&s;t be done with a willing Mind, and with a chearful Heart; for o|thewi&s;e our &s;hewing of Mercy is not perform'd in a due Manner, and for Want of this the Duty will prove an in&s;ignificant Thing: And therefore it is no Wonder, if the APOSTLE (altho' he does &s;uppo&s;e, and take it for granted, that a Chri&s;tian is not wanting in the Practice of ALMSGIVING, in &s;hewing MERCY to the POOR) enjoins us that we be particularly careful that this be done with CHEARFULNESS. For no greater Mi&s;ery can befall the Poor than to be forced to depend on the Help of &s;uch Per&s;ons, who&s;e tender Mercies are
<PB N="251" REF="286">CRUELTIES. THAT can never be a Love of our BRETHREN, THAT can never be chearful Benevolence, which does not &s;ympathize with the Mi&s;erable: THAT can never be true chearful Benevolence, which begins with trampling on that Self-love which is in&s;eparable from the human Brea&s;t, and never relieves the indigent Soul, till it has wounded it in its tendere&s;t Part: THAT can never be chearful Benevolence, which throws into De&s;pair tho&s;e that are the Objects of it. Some Pretenders there are to this Virtue, who ne'er be|&s;tow an Alms, or relieve the Poor, but they un|mercifully in&s;i&s;t on a particular Enumeration of all their Mi&s;eries; they bring Face to Face the whole GROUPE of their Misfortunes; of them|&s;elves (for ought the&s;e Impertinents can tell) in|&s;upportable: and tho' the Ceremonial of their Que&s;tions, or rather of their burthen&s;ome Exami|nation, preceeds the A&s;&s;i&s;tance they are plea&s;ed to afford the Poor, yet they are plea&s;ed to call that Benevolence, they are plea&s;ed to call that BRO|THERLY LOVE; but, in my Mind, it is an Act brutal, barbarous, and inhuman; and In&s;ult upon
<PB N="252" REF="287">Self-love, and not the Re&s;ult of any generous, any Chri&s;tian Sentiment: 'Tis a Benevolence, in &s;hort, that does Violence to the Advice of the APOSTLE, who would have us to &s;hew Mercy to the Poor with CHEARFULNESS.</P>
<P>THE Bu&s;ine&s;s of this Di&s;cour&s;e on the&s;e Words of the APOSTLE &s;hall be, to &s;hew the &s;everal Ties and Obligations we are under of &s;hewing Mercy unto the Poor with CHEARFULNESS:&mdash;And that I &s;hall do from the following Con&s;i|derations.</P>
<P N="1">1. WE ought to &s;hew Mercy unto the Poor with CHEARFULNESS, becau&s;e of the Relation they &s;tand in as to GOD. For as poor and mean &s;oever as they are, yet, 'tis certain, they are not &s;uch de&s;picable Per&s;ons as the Di&s;gui&s;e of their Misfortune under which they appear doth repre|&s;ent them. The very meane&s;t of them hath an immortal Soul, by which he does nearly re&s;emble GOD him&s;elf, and is comparable to the ANGELS; and all of them derive their Pedigree from HEAVEN,
<PB N="253" REF="288">and can call the KING ETERNAL, the SOVE|REIGN LORD of all the World, their FA|THER. Such they are as MEN, but much more con&s;iderable are they as CHRISTIANS; for as vile and contemptible &s;oever as they look, as meanly as they are cloath'd, yet GOD him&s;elf hath &s;uch a Regard to them, that for their Sakes he de|&s;cended from Heaven, and took their Nature upon him in the Per&s;on of his SON, and was plea&s;ed to lay down his Life for them: As contemptible &s;o|ever as they look, and as meanly as they are cloath'd, yet, by virtue of their Chri&s;tianity, they are all of them Members of CHRIST, Children of GOD, and Inheritors of the Kingdom of HEAVEN. In a Word, as contemptible &s;oever as they look, and as meanly as they are cloath'd, yet all of them are the Objects of GOD'S e&s;pecial Providence and Care, of his fatherly Love and Affection, and that equally with the greate&s;t Princes and Potentates; &s;ince ELIHU tells us, <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job xxxiv. 19.</NOTE> He ac|cepteth not the Per&s;ons of Princes, nor regard|eth
<PB N="254" REF="289">the Rich more than the Poor; they are all the Work of his Hands.</Q>&mdash;But,</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2dly,</HI> WE ought to &s;hew Mercy unto the Poor with CHEARFULNESS, becau&s;e of the Relation they &s;tand in as to US; they are our KINSMEN, nay, our very BRETHREN, both by NATURE and GRACE. By NATURE, all Nations of Men being made of<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts xvii. 26.</NOTE> ONE BLOOD, as the APOSTLE expre&s;&s;es it; and by GRACE, all Chri&s;tians being Children of the &s;ame heavenly Father, all Chri&s;tians being regenerated into the &s;ame lively Hope, and being Co-heirs of the &s;ame eternal Inheritance. So that if we do not con&s;ider the Nece&s;&s;ities of the Poor, and relieve them with CHEARFULNESS according to our Ability, we HIDE our&s;elves from our<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. lviii. 7.</NOTE> OWN FLESH, as the PROPHET expre&s;&s;es it, we are unkind to our very Kin&s;men and Brethren: Nay, if we are want|ing in this Duty, we di&s;claim all our Title to Chri&s;tianity, all Relation to CHRIST, our elder
<PB N="255" REF="290">Brother; the Love of our Fellow-Creature, and the &s;hewing Mercy to them with CHEARFUL|NESS, being the only infallible Evidence and De|mon&s;tration of our Love to him. <Q>&sect; By this &s;hall all Men know, &s;ays he, that ye are my Di&s;ciples, if ye have Love one to another.</Q> He does not in&s;tance in FAITH, or in HOPE, in KNOWLEDGE, or in any other Chri&s;tian Virtue; but he pitches upon BROTHERLY LOVE, and makes that the MARK and CHARACTER of his Di&s;ciples, by which they may be di&s;tingui&s;h'd and known from all the World be&s;ide.&mdash;Nay, the Love of our Brethren, and the &s;hewing Mercy to them with CHEARFULNESS, is made the Te&s;t of the Sincerity and Reality of our Love to GOD the FATHER.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 John iv. 20, 21.</NOTE> <Q>This is my Com|mandment, &s;ays our SAVIOUR, that he that loveth GOD, love his BROTHER al&s;o. He that loveth not his BROTHER, whom he hath &s;een, how can he love GOD whom he hath not &s;een?</Q>&mdash;That is, if to MEN,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">John xiii. 35.</NOTE> with whom
<PB N="256" REF="291">we daily conver&s;e, we do not expre&s;s any Love, what Rea&s;on is there to imagine that we &s;incerely love GOD; when, of our Love to him, and the Sincerity of it, we were never able to make this Trial, becau&s;e we never &s;aw him, nor had Oppor|tunity offer'd us of &s;hewing any real Acts of Love and Kindne&s;s to him? But &s;omewhat may be judged, I think, from the Difficulty of the Thing; for certainly he that doth not the ea&s;ier, will hardly be &s;uppos'd to do what is more difficult. Now you may ea&s;ily imagine, that it is hard to love one I never &s;aw; but no &s;uch difficult Matter to have a Kindne&s;s for the Per&s;on I have &s;een, &s;ince Sight and Conver&s;ation is one Motive of Affection; and therefore, ina&s;much as we never &s;aw GOD at any Time, but do &s;ee our BRETHREN daily, it very well may be concluded, that he who loveth not his BROTHER, whom he hath &s;een, does not, neither can be &s;uppo&s;ed to love GOD whom he hath not &s;een, tho' he &s;hould make never &s;uch zealous Prote&s;tations of his LOVE to him. But if we love our poor BRETHREN, whom we have &s;een, and &s;hew Mercy unto them with CHEAR|FULNESS,
<PB N="257" REF="292">FULNESS, 'tis a certain Sign that we have a &s;incere Love for GOD, who hath appointed them to be his Deputies and Proxies; and he hath pro|mi&s;ed to look upon that which is given to them as given to him&s;elf. <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xix. 17.</NOTE> He that hath Pity on the POOR, lendeth to the LORD,</Q> &s;ays the WISE MAN: And &s;ays our SAVIOUR, (&s;peak|ing of tho&s;e who had fed the hungry and cloath'd the naked) <Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matth. xxv. 40.</NOTE> Ina&s;much as ye have done it unto the lea&s;t of the&s;e my Brethren, ye have done it unto me;<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Heb. vi. 10.</NOTE> and GOD is not unrighteous to forget your Work and Labour of LOVE, which ye have &s;hew'd towards his Name, in that ye have mini&s;tred to the SAINTS, and do mini|&s;ter,</Q> &s;ays the APOSTLE. When therefore at any Time we &s;ee a real Object of Charity be|fore our Eyes, we may very well imagine (and it is no vain Fancy to imagine as much) that we &s;ee CHRIST our SAVIOUR &s;tanding before us, and ready to receive an ALMS at our Hands; to whom we may be kind and courteous, if we plea&s;e, we

<P>SUCH is the Relation that the POOR &s;tand in as to US, that by &s;hewing Mercy to them with CHEARFULNESS, we are a&s;&s;ured in SCRIP|TURE, that we &s;hall obtain Mercy our&s;elves at the Hand of GOD. <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. v. 7.</NOTE> Ble&s;&s;ed are the merciful, &s;ays our SAVIOUR, for they &s;hall obtain Mercy.</Q> Upon this Account it is that DA|NIEL advi&s;es <Q>NEBUCHADNEZZAR to <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dan. iv. 27.</NOTE> break off his Sins by Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and his Iniquities by &s;hewing Mercy to the POOR.</Q> And St JAMES tells us, that <Q><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ja. ii. 13.</NOTE> Mercy rejoiceth again&s;t JUDGMENT;</Q> <GAP DESC="foreign">, it boa&s;t|eth, it triumpheth over Judgment, that is, it ap|pea&s;eth GOD'S Wrath, and prevents our CON|DEMNATION and PUNISHMENT.</P>
<P>SUCH is the Relation that the POOR &s;tand in as to US, that by &s;hewing Mercy to them with
<PB N="259" REF="294">CHEARFULNESS, we are promis'd all earthly Ble&s;&s;ings, &s;uch as Health and Peace, and Pro&s;pe|rity, and Deliverance in Time of Trouble, Com|fort and Con&s;olation upon a Sick-bed. <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xli. 1.</NOTE> Ble&s;|&s;ed is he that con&s;idereth the Poor and Needy, the LORD will deliver him in Time of Trouble: The LORD will pre&s;erve and keep him alive, and he &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed upon the Earth; the LORD will &s;trengthen him upon the Bed of Langui&s;hing, and make all his BED in his SICKNESS.</Q> And becau&s;e there is one &s;eem|ingly con&s;iderable Objection that may be made again&s;t the Practice of this Duty, <HI>viz.</HI> the Fear of impoveri&s;hing our&s;elves, and prejudicing our E&s;tates; for the removing of the&s;e Fears, GOD has &s;olemnly promis'd not only Security from Want, but al&s;o a thriving Condition to charitable Per&s;ons. <Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxviii. 27.</NOTE> He that giveth to the Poor, &s;hall not lack; <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">ib. xi. 25.</NOTE> the liberal SOUL &s;hall be made fat.</Q></P>
<P>ALL the&s;e Things con&s;ider'd, 'tis mon&s;trous, I
<PB N="260" REF="295">think, how a Man can live with &s;o little Reflection, as to fancy he is not in a Condition very unju&s;t and di&s;proportion'd to the re&s;t of Mankind, while he enjoys Wealth, and exerts no Benevolence or Boun|ty, &s;hews no Mercy to the Needy and Afflicted, who &s;tand in &s;o near a Relation both to GOD and him&s;elf. <Q>One would really imagine, from the Behaviour of the Rich to the Poor, that they &s;tood in no Manner of Relation to each other; that they were Creatures quite of a different Species; e&s;pecially when one looks about him, and &s;ees a Creature all in Rags, crying out in the Name of all that's good and &s;acred, to be|hold his Mi&s;ery, and give him &s;ome Supply a|gain&s;t Hunger and Nakedne&s;s; and the Rich, and their very Servants, pa&s;&s;ing by them with an Air of Scorn and Triumph. But &s;o it is, that POVERTY and RICHES &s;tand now-a-days in People's Imaginations, in the Places of GUILT and INNOCENCE; and, when they would &s;peak to the Advantage of others, they &s;ay they are People of CONDITION. But in all Sea&s;ons there will be &s;ome In&s;tances of Per|&s;ons
<PB N="261" REF="296">who have Souls too large to be taken with popular Prejudices; and while the re&s;t of Man|kind are contending for Superiority in Power and Wealth, have their Thoughts bent upon the Nece&s;&s;ities of tho&s;e below them. The CHARITY-SCHOOLS which have been e|rected in this TOWN, are the greate&s;t In&s;tances of Publick Spirit the Age has produced in this Part of the World. And for the particular Occa&s;ion of them, there cannot any offer more worthy a generous Mind. Would you do an hand&s;ome Thing without Return? Do it for an INFANT that is not &s;en&s;ible of the Obligation. Would you do it for PUBLICK GOOD? Do it for one who will be an HONEST ARTIFI|CER. Would you do it for the Sake of HEAVEN? Give it to one who &s;hall be in|&s;tructed in the WORSHIP of him for who&s;e Sake you gave it. It is, methinks, a mo&s;t laud|able In&s;titution this, if it were of no other Ex|pectation than that of producing a Race of good and u&s;eful SERVANTS, who will have more than a liberal, a RELIGIOUS EDUCATION.
<PB N="262" REF="297">What would not a Man do, in common Pru|dence, to lay out in purcha&s;e of one about him, who would add to all his Orders he gave, the Weight of the COMMANDMENTS, to enforce an Obedience to them? For one who would con&s;ider his MASTER as his FATHER, his FRIEND, and BENEFACTOR, upon the ea&s;y Terms, and in Expectation of no other Return but MODERATE WAGES and GENTLE USAGE? It is the common Vice of CHILDREN to run too much among the Servants; from &s;uch as are educated in THESE Places they would &s;ee nothing but LOWLINESS in the Servant, which would not be di&s;ingenuous in the Child. All the ill Offices and defama|tory Whi&s;pers which take their Birth from Do|me&s;ticks, would be prevented, if this Charity could be made univer&s;al; and a good Man might have a Knowledge of the whole Life of the Per&s;ons he de&s;igns to take into his Hou&s;e for his own Service, or that of his Family or Children, long before they were admitted. This
<PB N="263" REF="298">would create endearing Dependencies; and the Obligation would have a paternal Air in the Ma&s;ter, who would be relieved from much Care and Anxiety, from the Gratitude and Di|ligence of an humble FRIEND attending him as his SERVANT. In &s;hort, tho&s;e that have the Happine&s;s to be Contributors to &s;uch religi|ous In&s;titutions of INNOCENTS, can never, I'm &s;ure, di&s;po&s;e of Money more to their Sa|tisfaction and Advantage. As for my own Part, the Good-will I bear to Mankind makes me heartily wi&s;h tho&s;e pious Works may be encou|raged, that the pre&s;ent Promoters may reap the Delight, and Po&s;terity the Benefit of them. &mdash; But whil&s;t we are cultivating this young hope|ful Offspring, and &s;hewing Mercy to them with CHEARFULNESS, let not the ANCIENT and HELPLESS Creatures be &s;hamefully ne|glected. There are, I know, many Impo&s;tors among them: Lamene&s;s and Blindne&s;s are very often acted; but &s;till there are many proper Objects that implore your Charity. There are many indu&s;trious poor HOUSE-KEEPERS
<PB N="264" REF="299">who &s;ubmit to the harde&s;t Labour and coar&s;e&s;t Fare, rather than endure the Shame of taking Relief from the PARISH, or a&s;king it in the STREETS, that we ought not to overlook; they are the HUNGRY, the THIRSTY, and the NAKED, that we are commanded by our SAVIOUR to relieve; and we ought to be per&s;uaded, that if any Man is come hither for Shelter again&s;t Per&s;ecution or Oppre&s;&s;ion, that he is the STRANGER that we ought to take in. If any Countryman of our own is fallen in|to the Hands of INFIDELS, and lives in a State of mi&s;erable Captivity, this is the Man in PRISON, and we &s;hould contribute to his RANSOM. It were endle&s;s to mention all the Variety of Wretchedne&s;s, and the numberle&s;s POOR that are proper Objects, and to whom we ought to &s;hew Mercy with CHEARFULNESS. Who, without an Eye of Pity, can &s;ee a di&s;abled SAILOR, the Purveyor of many of the Ad|vantages of Life, de&s;titute of Nece&s;&s;aries? Who can behold an hone&s;t SOLDIER, that bravely with&s;tood the ENEMY, pro&s;trate, and

<P>I SHOULD propo&s;e it as a Rule to every one who is provided with any Competency of Fortune more than &s;ufficient for the Nece&s;&s;aries of Life, to lay a&s;ide a certain Proportion of his Income for the U&s;e of the POOR. This I would look upon as an OFFERING to HIM who has a Right to the WHOLE, for the U&s;e of tho&s;e whom he has de&s;cribed in SACRED WRIT as his own RE|PRESENTATIVES upon EARTH. At the &s;ame Time we &s;hould manage our Charity with &s;uch Prudence and Caution, that we may not hurt our own Friends and Relations, whil&s;t we are doing Good to tho&s;e who are Strangers to us&mdash;We &s;hould pre&s;cribe to our&s;elves many particular Days of FASTING and ABSTINENCE, in order to increa&s;e our private Bank of Charity; and &s;et a&s;ide what would be the current Expences of tho&s;e
<PB N="266" REF="301">Times for the U&s;e of the Poor and Needy: We &s;hould divert the Money which we &s;ometimes de|&s;ign to &s;pend in going to a CONCERT, or an ASSEMBLY, a COFFEE-HOUSE, or a TAVERN, or the Entertainments of the THEATRE, upon &s;ome Object of Charity, or the fir&s;t nece&s;&s;itous Per&s;on that falls in our Way. By the&s;e Means we may be charitable to the POOR, without impo|veri&s;hing our&s;elves or our Friends, and enjoy our E&s;tate or Income by making it the Property of others.</P>
<P>THERE are few Men &s;o cramped in their private Affairs, who may not be charitable after this Manner, without any Di&s;advantage to them|&s;elves, or Prejudice to their Families. It is but &s;ometimes &s;acrificing a DIVERSION or Con|venience to the POOR, and turning the u&s;ual Cour&s;e of our Expences into a better Channel. This is, I think, not only the mo&s;t prudent and convenient, but the mo&s;t meritorious Piece of Charity, which we can put in Practice. By this Method we in &s;ome Mea&s;ure &s;hare the Nece&s;&s;ities
<PB N="267" REF="302">of the POOR at the &s;ame Time that we relieve them; and make our&s;elves not only their PATRONS, but their FELLOW-SUFFERERS.</P>
<P>BEFORE I conclude, I cannot forbear making an Extract of &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages which I have al|ways read with great Delight in the Book of JOB. It is the Account which that holy Man gives of his Behaviour in the Days of his Pro&s;perity.</P>
<Q><P>OH that I were as in Months pa&s;t, as in the Days when GOD pre&s;erved me: When his Candle &s;hined upon my Head, and when by his Light I walked through Darkne&s;s: When the ALMIGHTY was yet with me: When my Children were about me: When I wa&s;hed my Steps with Butter, and the Rocks poured out Rivers of Oil!</P>
<P>WHEN the Ear heard me, then it ble&s;&s;ed me; and when the Eye &s;aw me, it gave Wit|ne&s;s to me: Becau&s;e I delivered the Poor that cried, and the Fatherle&s;s, and him that had
<PB N="268" REF="303">none to help him. The Ble&s;&s;ing of him that was ready to peri&s;h came upon me; and I cau&s;ed the Widow's Heart to &s;ing for Joy. I was Eyes to the Blind, and Feet was I to the Lame; I was a Father to the Poor, and the Cau&s;e which I knew not I &s;earched out. Did not I weep for him that was in Trouble? Was not my Soul grieved for the Poor? Let me be weighed in an even Balance, that GOD may know mine Integrity. If I did de&s;pi&s;e the Cau&s;e of my Man-Servant, or of my Maid-Servant, when they contended with me: What then &s;hall I do when GOD ri&s;eth up? And when he vi&s;iteth, what &s;hall I an&s;wer him? Did not he that made me in the Womb make him? And did not one fa&s;hion us in the Womb? If I have with-held the Poor from their De&s;ire, or cau&s;ed the Eyes of the Widow to fail, or have eaten my Mor&s;el my&s;elf alone, and the Father|le&s;s hath not eaten thereof: If I have &s;een any peri&s;h for Want of Cloathing, or any Poor with|out Covering: If his Loins have not ble&s;&s;ed me,
<PB N="269" REF="304">and if he were not warmed with the Fleece of my Sheep: If I have lifted up mine Hand again&s;t the Fatherle&s;s when I &s;aw my Help in the Gate; then let mine Arm fall from my Shoulder-blade, and mine Arm be broken from the Bone. If I have rejoiced at the De&s;truction of him that hated me, or lift up my&s;elf when Evil found him: (Neither have I &s;uffered my Mouth to &s;in, by wi&s;hing a Cur&s;e to his Soul) The Stranger did not lodge in the Street; but I opened my Doors to the Traveller. If my Land cry again&s;t me, or that the Furrows there|of likewi&s;e complain: If I have eaten the Fruits thereof without Money, or have cau&s;ed the Owners thereof to lo&s;e their Life; let Thi&s;tles grow in&s;tead of Wheat, and Cockles in&s;tead of Barley.</P></Q>
<P>IN what heroick In&s;tances is CHARITY here de&s;cribed, and with what a noble Heat of Senti|ments! If the Account which that good Man gives of his Demeanour in the Days of his Afflu|ence, were con&s;ider'd only as a human Compo&s;i|tion,

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS is an excellent Le&s;&s;on of Advice given by the Apo&s;tle St PAUL to the Chri&s;tians of GALATIA; who were engaged in great Heats and eager Di&s;putes about &s;ome Matters which might ea&s;ily have been compromi&s;ed and made up, if they had come to them with that calm Con&s;ideration and Chri&s;tian Love, which became the holy Religion they pro|fe&s;&s;ed, and the Things about which they conte&s;ted.&mdash;He &s;ugge&s;ts to them by the Way, that mo&s;t
<PB N="276" REF="310">of the Matters they pu&s;h'd on in their Di&s;putes with &s;o much Fury and Contention, were either no Parts of Religion at all, <HI>viz.</HI> &s;ome nice Punc|tilios of the Ceremonial LAW; or el&s;e did not de|&s;erve &s;uch high Regard in their Affections, as to come in Competition with the LOVE of their BRETHREN; which was either laid a&s;ide, or much weaken'd, by their fierce Contentions about the&s;e le&s;&s;er Matters. This he enforces by telling them, <Q>All the Law is fulfilled in one Word, which is this, Thou &s;halt love thy NEIGH|BOUR as thy&s;elf.</Q> That is, that the LOVE of our NEIGHBOUR, as it is a &s;hort and ea&s;y, &s;o it is a principal Le&s;&s;on of Chri&s;tianity, and ought not to be le&s;&s;en'd but in Differences of the highe&s;t Importance; which Chri&s;tian LOVE and CHARITY, as it is agreeable to the Will of GOD, &s;o it is like to have a more e&s;pecial Ble&s;&s;ing and Reward. But as for Factions and Contentions, and peevi&s;h Di&s;putes among Chri&s;tians, without ju&s;t Occa&s;ion, he tells them plainly, that they mu&s;t expect no good Effects from them; but that if they be

I. I AM to &s;hew how FACTION, and BANDY|ING into Parties, tend to the Ruin of any CHURCH or NATION.</P>
<P>NOW Faction, and BANDYING into Parties, tend to the Ruin of any Church or Nation;</P>
<P N="1"><HI>1&s;t,</HI> <Q>BECAUSE this very much weakens the Strength and Power of any &s;uch Community.</Q> A Community, without Unity, is a dead and lifele&s;s Thing: 'Tis this which gives it a Soul, and Nerves, and Vigour; and &s;o many Degrees as you take off from this Union, &s;o much the nigher it comes to its Di&s;&s;olution, and a perfect Anarchy. When the Members of a Society are tied together by a hearty Affection and an unanimous Concur|rence in their De&s;igns, they are like the numerous Threads of a CABLE twi&s;ted into Cordage of an immen&s;e Strength; whil&s;t the &s;ame, di&s;united and parcell'd out into different Intere&s;ts, are but like a SINGLE TWINE, &s;ubject to the Snap of the weake&s;t Hand. But Faction is yet more prejudi|cial to a Community than a bare Negation or want
<PB N="279" REF="313">of Union; for every &s;ingle factious Per&s;on in a Nation, not only denies his own A&s;&s;i&s;tance to the Community, but takes off likewi&s;e an equal Force of his Adver&s;ary: So that a Nation, which con|&s;i&s;ts only of Two Millions of People, is equal in Strength to a Nation of Ten Millions, whereof Eight Millions are engaged in two contrary Fac|tions. For, on this Suppo&s;ition, the two remaining Millions are the only effectual Per&s;ons to be de|pended upon for the Security of the Nation; the other Parties being &s;et and at a Stand, and wholly taken up in their mutual Oppo&s;ition to each other. This is demon&s;trably true, whenever the two con|tending Parties are &s;teadily re&s;olved upon each o|ther's De&s;truction, and will not be awaken'd into Concord from the Danger of a common Enemy. And as Hi&s;tory has given us frequent In&s;tances of this Infatuation and Madne&s;s; &s;o no Party, in the Heat of their Contention, can be a&s;&s;ured, either of their own Prudence, or of the Grace of GOD, that they &s;hall not fall into this de&s;perate Folly. And the Ca&s;e is exactly the &s;ame in a Church or Body of Chri&s;tians. And, among innumerable
<PB N="280" REF="314">Faults, Unity, or mutual Concord, is the only Vir|tue that I know which is peculiar to the Church of ROME. In this <Q>they are wi&s;er in their Ge|neration than the Children of Light:</Q> By the&s;e prudent Methods, under the Permi&s;&s;ion of GOD, for the Puni&s;hment of the Sins of the World, they have kept up their idolatrous Polity for &s;o many Ages; whil&s;t we of the REFORMED CHURCH, in the Mid&s;t of &s;o many Animo&s;ities and Divi&s;ions, have had nothing to pre&s;erve us, but the unac|countable Providence of GOD, and a better Cau&s;e.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2dly,</HI> <Q>BECAUSE this very much perplexes their Councils.</Q> It is the highe&s;t Advantage for a Nation to have their Affairs go on under the Influence of wi&s;e and &s;teady Councils; when Men of the greate&s;t Ability are gathered together, who, with the utmo&s;t Compa&s;s of a &s;agacious Ca|pacity, can take in all the Po&s;&s;ibilities of fortuitous Events, which may affect the Government they are entru&s;ted with; who can, with impartial Con|&s;ideration, &s;can over whatever is propo&s;ed in tho&s;e
<PB N="281" REF="315">great Debates, and &s;eparate the plau&s;ible and the &s;pecious from what is &s;olid and of la&s;ting Conve|nience to the Nation; and who will &s;et a&s;ide no|thing that is wi&s;ely offered out of any invidious Regard, but will with Readine&s;s embrace every Thing which has a fair Pro&s;pect and Tendency to the Good of the Cummunity, from what&s;oever Quar|ter it comes, as well from the Mouth of a private Adver&s;ary, as a Bo&s;om-Friend. Now, a Nation can enjoy the Happine&s;s of this ble&s;&s;ed Effect, only when they are at perfect Union with them&s;elves, and no Faction is reigning among them: For Faction quite poi&s;ons all political Debates, repre&s;ents what|ever is mo&s;t hone&s;tly and wi&s;ely advanced in the wor&s;e Colours; rai&s;es Su&s;picions of the mo&s;t en|tire Propo&s;als; and puts Men upon Projects which in their Con&s;cience they believe to be le&s;s conducive to the Publick, rather than let their hated Adver&s;aries, of the oppo&s;ite Party, reap the Honour and Succe&s;s but of a prudent Propo&s;al. This incites Men, out of Envy and Revenge, to betray the Coun&s;els they are bound to conceal; to calumniate the Actions of good Mini&s;ters of State,
<PB N="282" REF="316">and to glo&s;s over the pernicious De&s;igns of bad ones; to be &s;canty and precipitate in Debates for the Publick Good, but to &s;pare no Time or Ap|plication in advancing the Intere&s;t of a Party; in defending the Faults of their own Friends, and expo&s;ing tho&s;e of their Adver&s;aries; in excu&s;ing or extenuating great Crimes, or puni&s;hing &s;maller with unmerciful Severities. The&s;e have been the con&s;tant Effects of Faction in the Councils of Na|tions throughout all Ages; andnever any Govern|ment had a Downfall or Decay, but that the&s;e unhappy Accidents were the fir&s;t of its Misfor|tunes, and gave a Ri&s;e to its following Ruin.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>3dly,</HI> <Q>BECAUSE this expo&s;es them to their Adver&s;aries.</Q> The Power of a Nation does not always con&s;i&s;t in the actual Strength of Forces, or the Abilities of a Mini&s;try. There is often|times a great deal owing to Opinion; and an Ene|my frequently with-holds his Hand, not becau&s;e a Country is in&s;uperable, but becau&s;e he thinks it &s;o. Nay, where &s;ufficient Strength is not wanting, if you lay a Nation open to Contempt, and make it
<PB N="283" REF="317">vile in the Opinion of its Enemies, you have gone half Way into the Conque&s;t of it before a Stroke is &s;truck; for an Adver&s;ary comes on then amain, and pu&s;hes forward with Alacrity and Courage, when he has poor and mean Thoughts of tho&s;e who are to oppo&s;e him. Now, can any Nation be pictured out in &s;uch wretched Colours, and be rendered &s;o de&s;picable in the Sight of their Ene|mies, as that People which is divided into great and &s;pightful Factions? How do they load one another with all the opprobrious Language which an envenom'd Rage can &s;ugge&s;t; upbraiding each other with Fal&s;ene&s;s and Treachery, Cruelty and Villainy, or any other Crime which is be&s;t &s;uited to blacken the Character of their Oppo&s;ites? A COURT is repre&s;ented as full of Flattery and Di&s;&s;imulation, or intent only upon the advancing of private Fortunes, and cru&s;hing the publick Liberties; a CITY traduced for Mutiny and Sedition; and a COUNTRY, &s;ometimes for want of Zeal and Affection for their Governors; and at other Times for a Superabundancy of it: Some ca|lumniated for endeavouring to introduce an arbitrary
<PB N="284" REF="318">Power, and others as de&s;igning a democratical Licence: Some traduced for Hypocri&s;y, and others for Prophanene&s;s: Some noted for Weakne&s;s, and others for Corruption: Some branded for Bigots, and others for Athei&s;m. Now, whenever national Di&s;tempers are wrought up to the&s;e Heights, what Advantage cannot the common Enemy propo&s;e to them&s;elves, when they have to do with a Peo|ple, which, without the Expence of Intelligence, will trumpet out their own Failures them&s;elves, and proclaim to the World that they are already conquer'd by their own VICES?</P>
<P N="4"><HI>4thly,</HI> <Q>BECAUSE this renders them ob|noxious to the Anger of GOD.</Q> There is no Command of GOD in SCRIPTURE more po&s;i|tive and plain, and no Invitation more pre&s;&s;ing than tho&s;e which engage us to PEACE and UNITY, and di&s;&s;uade from STRIFE and CON|TENTION. It is the particular Command of our BLESSED LORD, and the la&s;t and mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing Clo&s;e of a very affectionate Di&s;cour&s;e of his,
<PB N="285" REF="319">"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mark ix. 50.</NOTE> Have Peace one with another:" And the APOSTLE to the HEBREWS advi&s;eth us to "<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb. xii. 14.</NOTE> Follow PEACE with all Men." Men there|fore that are engaged in a Faction can never be good Chri&s;tians; for that Malice and Bitterne&s;s which u&s;ually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the Minds of tho&s;e that are in a Party, is perfectly incon&s;i&s;tent with the Charity which the Chri&s;tian Religion indi&s;pen&s;ably requires.&mdash;Proceed we now to &s;hew,</P>
<P N="2">II. BY what proper Methods FACTIONS may be allay'd.</P>
<P>NOW I &s;hall here lay down &s;ome few Rules, which, according to the be&s;t of my Judgment, I conceive may be very expedient to this End; &s;ub|mitting it always to the better Judgment of others, e&s;pecially to tho&s;e whom I have now the Honour of &s;peaking before.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>1&s;t,</HI> <Q>To allow tho&s;e who are of a different
<PB N="286" REF="320">OPINION or INTEREST from us a pretty fre|quent and ea&s;y CONVERSATION.</Q> There can be no Party in a Nation &s;o wicked and dete&s;t|able, that we &s;hould hate them like DOGS and SNAKES: They do not forfeit the Rights of com|mon Humanity and good Neighbourhood, from entertainng &s;ome Thoughts different from ours: Nay, by a fair Corre&s;pondence, our Differences do very much le&s;&s;en; for then we have no Alienation of Affections to keep us at a Di&s;tance, and nothing lies between us but the pure Merits of our Cau&s;e. And in a calm and friendly Debate of mutual Mi&s;under&s;tandings, I never yet knew two Adver|&s;aries but that they were nigher in Opinion to each other than they thought they were, whil&s;t they kept at a Di&s;tance. For their &s;trangene&s;s and &s;hyne&s;s to one another, kept up always their Pa&s;|&s;ions eager, and, as it were, ready charged for Execution; they entertain'd a World of ground|le&s;s Jealou&s;ies and Su&s;picions, and were blown up into yet greater Flames by the Mi&s;repre&s;entations of de&s;igning Men; which have been all laid a&s;ide, and quietly compo&s;ed, as they came to under&s;tand
<PB N="287" REF="321">and freely conver&s;e with one another. Then their mutual Civilities, the Gentlene&s;s of their Lan|guage, and the Sweetne&s;s of their Behaviour, has &s;o endear'd their Affections, that the mi&s;taken Per&s;on &s;eldom fails of Conviction, and giving him|&s;elf up to Truth; or, however, the Difference is very much le&s;&s;en'd, and all Hatred and Malice being laid a&s;ide, there is only the Opinion of the Party, without the Virulence, retain'd.</P>
<P>NOW our BLESSED SAVIOUR pro&s;ecuted this Method with the mo&s;t happy Succe&s;s. For he vouch&s;afed to undergo the Stain of conver&s;ing with the Wor&s;t of Men, with PUBLICANS and SINNERS, and with the keene&s;t of Factions, the PHARISEES and SADDUCES: But by his en|dearing Conver&s;ation, and by his taking the pru|dent Occa&s;ions of in&s;tilling wi&s;e, and holy, and peaceable Principles, in a &s;hort Time he brought into one common Religion the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite Par|ties, and made the greate&s;t SAINTS out of the mo&s;t flagitious OFFENDERS.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="288" REF="322">
<HI>2dly,</HI> <Q>ANOTHER Method to allay a FAC|TION, is by avoiding all CALUMNIES and invidious REFLECTIONS upon the oppo&s;ite PARTY.</Q> The Apo&s;tle St JUDE makes a very excellent Ob&s;ervation with regard to this Point, drawn from the Example of MICHAEL the ARCHANGEL, who had an Adver&s;ary liable enough to Exception, <HI>viz.</HI> the DEVIL; and yet he would not bring even again&s;t him A RAILING ACCUSATION. And indeed Calumnies and &s;piteful Reflections do no Good in any Cau&s;e; nay, generally they do more Mi&s;chief to the Quarter from whence they come, than to tho&s;e again&s;t whom they are &s;ent: For &s;uch &s;ort of Ex|pre&s;&s;ions make no Impre&s;&s;ion upon any wi&s;e Man, and can never convince, or bring over any Man. The&s;e may make Men hate their Calumniators, but they &s;eem the wor&s;t-laid Expedients for to per|&s;uade them. But it is a Je&s;t for Men to wi&s;h an End to Factions and Conte&s;ts, and to pray for U|nity and Concord, whil&s;t they are loading their Adver&s;aries with hard Names, and &s;uch heavy Imputations, as &s;erve only to keep up, and as
<PB N="289" REF="323">much as in them lies, to eternize the Quarrel. For one ill-natur'd Reflection begets another by way of Reprizal, and that again gives birth to a third, till the Faction, like the WIND, gathers Strength by Repercu&s;&s;ion; and, what was at fir&s;t in a manner harmle&s;s and imperceptible, ri&s;es by Degrees into the Fury of a STORM, and rends, and tears, and breaks all to Pieces before it. Scandalous Reports, and invidious Names of Di&s;tinction, are the Alarms to Faction; they are the Drums and Trumpets that give the Call to Sedition, and draw off Men from the common Intere&s;t to the particular Squadrons of their Party. But lay a&s;ide the&s;e, and Men fall in again into the publick Body; they go forwards in pur&s;uing once more the common Good, till at la&s;t they are united both in Intere&s;t and Affection.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>3dly,</HI> <Q>ANOTHER Method of allaying FAC|TION, is by &s;etting a&s;ide OLD ANIMOSITIES.</Q> There will never an End be put to Differences, if the old ones be &s;till brought to Account; and when Men are at pre&s;ent di&s;pos'd to Quiet, they mu&s;t
<PB N="290" REF="324">not be allow'd Quarter, by rea&s;on of their former Offences. Be&s;ides, in a long and la&s;ting Faction, where Enmities are handed down, and, as it were, bequeath'd to Po&s;terity, it is very unrea&s;onable that a new Generation &s;hould be an&s;werable for all the Irregularities committed by their Predece&s;&s;ors, and that we &s;hould revenge that upon them which their Fore-fathers have done. This is a Way to entail Quarrels upon our own Children, and to leave them to be reprized upon in the next Gene|ration, for Unkindne&s;&s;es we have done to other Men in this. To be for ever ruminating upon an old Injury; and, when Time begins to wear off both the Sen&s;e and Memory of the Offence, for us indu&s;triou&s;ly to revive it, and it &s;pite of Nature to keep up the Keenne&s;s of it, is, methinks, unna|tural, and contrary to the very Frame of our Tem|per. Even PRINCES and STATES, who have the nice&s;t Sen&s;e of Honour, and, for the Intere&s;t and Security of their Countries, &s;tand obliged more par|ticularly to re&s;ent Indignities offer'd; even they make Leagues and Alliances, without a Liquidation of antiquated Accounts: For, to &s;can over all the&s;e
<PB N="291" REF="325">with Exactne&s;s, would engage the World in an eternal War; and therefore I do not think but that it is a Duty incumbent upon their Subjects, to make as many Paces towards a Peace and Union among them&s;elves at home, as their Superiors with relation to their Neighbours abroad.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>4thly,</HI> <Q>ANOTHER Method towards allaying a FACTION in a NATION, is by &s;etting a&s;ide all PRIVATE INTEREST.</Q> Now whatever Men pretend, of either Side in a Faction; whether the Prerogative of the PRINCE, or the Privilege of the PEOPLE; the Good of the CHURCH, or the Welfare of the STATE; the&s;e are too often but &s;pecious Pretences, and Words without a Meaning: But the true Rea&s;on of all their angry Words, and &s;piteful Treatment of their Adver&s;aries is, becau&s;e they interfere with one another's Intere&s;t and Profit. Places of great Advantage are with greedy Expectance hunted after by &s;ome, whil&s;t others are vexed with the Lo&s;s of them, or put them&s;elves upon the wor&s;t Methods for retaining them. 'Tis from hence,
<PB N="292" REF="326">that the loud Clamours and Accu&s;ations ari&s;e; 'tis this occa&s;ions the Su&s;picions of being di&s;affected to the CROWN, or el&s;e of bearing in upon po|pular LIBERTY; 'tis this which draws in all Friends and Dependents of great Men on both Sides, till whole Nations are in a Manner divided for the &s;ake of a few ambitious Men, and do of|tentimes ruin them&s;elves to make others great. This has been the con&s;tant Method of Faction thro' all Ages: It was the Love of &s;uch Intere&s;t that led on CAESAR, and POMPEY, and CRASSUS, to divide the Power of the whole ROMAN World between them: 'Twas this that rais'd &s;uch Jea|lou&s;ies and Di&s;contents of corrupt and arbitrary Mini&s;ters on one Side, and de&s;igning Innovators on the other, till that mighty Empire was all blown up into a Flame, and for almo&s;t half an Age lay weltering in its own Blood. And we may rea&s;onably pre&s;ume, that this is the Ca&s;e of Fac|tion in our Age and Nation, and will be &s;o in fu|ture Times. There will never be a Time in which &s;ome Men will not be a&s;piring to Power, and others endeavouring to &s;upport or &s;upplant them
<PB N="293" REF="327">in it; unle&s;s it &s;hall happen, as I believe it never will, that there be left no de&s;igning and no un|thinking People in the World. 'Twas a &s;ad Re|flection that on the People of ROME, PANEM, <HI>&amp;</HI> CIRCENSES, that they might be brought over to any Man's Intere&s;t by FEASTS and SHEWS; but later Times have &s;hewn, that Men can rai&s;e Parties without &s;o much as the Virtue of LIBE|RALITY, and draw in People to quarrel for them, at the Expence only of PAMPHLETS, LIBELS, and &s;editious TALK.</P>
<P N="5"><HI>5thly,</HI> <Q>THE la&s;t Method I &s;hall propo&s;e for allaying FACTION, is a hearty ZEAL for the PUBLICK GOOD, and a &s;incere Concern for HOLINESS and true RELIGION.</Q> When Men have only an Aim at the publick Welfare, they can never be engaged in a Faction: For a Faction is an uncertain Thing; it either acts for or again&s;t the publick Good, as the Leaders of it are di&s;po&s;ed. Nay, there is &s;eldom a Faction of ten Years Con|tinuance, but within that Space of Time it acts incon&s;i&s;tently, and in Contradiction to it&s;elf.
<PB N="294" REF="328">Therefore it is a good Way, (to le&s;&s;en a Faction, and to avoid the Misfortunes and Levity of it) with a &s;teady Eye, to pur&s;ue whatever a Man thinks, to the be&s;t of his Judgment, to be for the true Intere&s;t of the Nation; and not to fall into it, becau&s;e he &s;ees others of his Party doing &s;o before him, or to be again&s;t it, becau&s;e others are for it whom he does not affect. This, if Men would do &s;incerely, tho' they &s;hould appear to be mi&s;taken, GOD will never call them to an Account for it: Be|&s;ides, the Numbers of the oppo&s;ite Parties would continually decrea&s;e; Men would pur&s;ue the Con|cerns of the Nation with as much Application as they do their own; and the Honour and Power of our Country would grow as fa&s;t as private Fortunes. And &s;o, if a Point be labour'd between the two contending Parties, let every Man &s;eriou&s;ly lay his Hand upon his Heart, and attentively con&s;ider, and a&s;k his own Con&s;cience impartially to &s;peak what it judges to be mo&s;t tending to the Glory of GOD, and the Advancement of true RELIGION. If they would do this upon every Difference be|tween Party and Party and Party, I do verily be|lieve,
<PB N="295" REF="329">in every Di&s;pute, that four Parts in five of the Nation would be of one Side.&mdash;But to ha&s;ten to our third general Head,</P>
<P N="3">III. To make &s;ome Application from what has been &s;aid with re&s;pect to our&s;elves, and the pre&s;ent State of Affairs.</P>
<P>I HAVE hitherto, in this Di&s;cour&s;e, &s;hewn the great Mi&s;chief which Faction brings to a Nation, and the mo&s;t proper Methods of allaying it, drawn chiefly from the Ob&s;ervation I have made from ancient Hi&s;tory, without any Strictures upon the unhappy Differences of our own Times. And the Arguments and Rea&s;oning I have made U&s;e of, are very obvious to every one's Under&s;tanding, and what mo&s;t Men do of their own &s;elves take Notice of; tho' few, thro' the Heat of Oppo&s;i|tion, deduce them into Practice. And would to GOD the&s;e few Hints I have here cur&s;orily given, may obtain &s;uch a Ble&s;&s;ing of GOD upon them, as to awaken us into a better Temper, and to allay tho&s;e unchri&s;tian Heats which have &s;o di&s;compo&s;ed us.
<PB N="296" REF="330">We of this Nation have unhappily &s;tood divided, pretty nigh upon the &s;ame Footing, longer than any People I have met withal in Story; even &s;o high as Queen ELIZABETH'S Time, the PURITANS began their Clamours again&s;t the CHURCH, who, being cheri&s;h'd too much by &s;ome Grandees in the COURT, by their Tumults and Libels, became at la&s;t formidable to the State. Unhappy Jealou&s;ies and Bickerings of this &s;ort ran throughout one of the mo&s;t peaceable Reigns, <HI>viz.</HI> of King JAMES the Fir&s;t; and in the Time of his good, tho' un|fortunate Son, nothing was &s;een but Sedition, and Plunder, and Sacrilege, and an Ocean of Civil Blood. And &s;ince THAT, even in later Reigns, we have been perplex'd with Plots and Rebellions; and at pre&s;ent are under continual Apprehen&s;ions of an approaching ENEMY; an Enemy that would endeavour to introduce Popery and arbitrary Power. May we therefore all of us join in Heart and Mind to oppo&s;e the Attempts of this our com|mon Adver&s;ary; and let us in THIS Reign revive the Glory of the LAST, when the well-affected Nobility and Gentry, City and Country, were all
<PB N="297" REF="331">&s;triving who &s;hould go greate&s;t Lengths for the Honour of their PRINCE, and the Intere&s;t of the NATION. And may GOD grant, that as it was the Happine&s;s of that Reign to cripple the then exorbitant Power of the Di&s;affected in the Nation; &s;o may it be the di&s;tingui&s;hing Glory of his pre&s;ent MAJESTY'S Reign, for the Security of our Religion, our Laws, and our Liberties, by the happy Succe&s;s of our Arms, to prepare a Way for the Downfall of the PRETENDER to the&s;e Kingdoms.</P>
<P>'TWAS a noble Stand which his late MAJESTY made again&s;t Popery; and I think his pre&s;ent mo&s;t gracious MAJESTY hath &s;hewn as great an Aver|&s;ion to that foul Super&s;tition our Adver&s;aries would bind upon us; and how great an Enemy he is to arbitrary Power, is at pre&s;ent &s;ufficiently demon|&s;trated, by his carrying on his Arms with &s;o much Vigour and Courage again&s;t the common USURPER of the Rights of Mankind. Under his happy Government we all of us enjoy our Liberties, our Laws, and our Religion, and
<PB N="298" REF="332">tho&s;e upon as firm a Security as can be de&s;ired. And what can any rea&s;onable Man de&s;ire more? As for Offices of great Profit and Honour, they can be enjoy'd but by a few; and if the want of the&s;e was a Ground for Contention, there could be no End of quarrelling, till we became a Nation of MAGISTRATES, and OFFICERS of STATE. The be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t Way is, to leave the Di&s;po&s;al of the&s;e to our Superiors, who to be &s;ure under|&s;tand them be&s;t, and for the generality are more impartial than Men are wont to be in the Opinion of them&s;elves. Upon the whole, therefore, let us avoid the being made Tools to ambitious Mens' De&s;igns, and to be &s;et on to worry one another, to manage other Peoples' Game, and in which there is not one in a Thou&s;and of us &s;hall find any Ac|count. Let us live in a dutiful Subjection to the pre&s;ent GOVERNMENT, and in an entire Con|formity to the ESTABLISH'D CHURCH.</P>
