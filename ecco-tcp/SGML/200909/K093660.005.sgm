<P>I Am &s;itting down to begin the ta&s;k of adding a new volume to the&s;e e&s;&s;ays, when the la&s;t day of the year 1789 is within a few hours of its conclu&s;ion, and I &s;hall bid farewell to this eventful period with a grateful mind for its having pa&s;&s;ed lightly over my head without any extraordinary perturbation or misfortune on my part &s;uffered, gently leading me towards that de&s;tined and not far di&s;tant hour, when I, like it, &s;hall be no more.</P>
<P>I have accompanied it through all tho&s;e changes and &s;ucce&s;&s;ions of &s;ea&s;ons, which in our
<PB N="2" REF="8">
climate are &s;o &s;trongly di&s;criminated; have &s;hared in the plea&s;ures and productions of each, and if any little idle jars or bickerings may occa|&s;ionally have &s;tarted up betwixt us, as will &s;ome|times happen to the be&s;t of friends, I willingly con&s;ign them to oblivion, and keep in mind only tho&s;e kind and good offices, which will plea&s;e on reflection, and &s;erve to endear the memory of the decea&s;ed.</P>
<P>All days in twelve months will not be days of &s;un&s;hine; but I will &s;ay this for <HI>my friend in his la&s;t moments,</HI> that I cannot put my finger upon one in the &s;ame century, that hath given birth to more intere&s;ting events, been a warmer advocate for the liberties and rights of mankind in general, or a kinder patron to this country in particular: I could name a day (if there was any need to point out what is &s;o &s;trongly im|pre&s;&s;ed on our hearts) a day of gratulation and thank&s;giving, which will ever &s;tand forth among&s;t the white&s;t in our calendar.</P>
<Q><L>Hic dies ver&egrave; mihi fe&s;tus atras</L>
<L>Eximet curas: ego nec tumultum,</L>
<L>Nec mori per vim metuam, tenente</L>
<L>Cae&s;are terras.</L><BIBL>HORAT.</BIBL></Q>
<Q><PB N="3" REF="9">
<L>This is indeed a fe&s;tal day,</L>
<L>A day that heals my cares and pains,</L>
<L>Drives death and danger far away,</L>
<L>And tells me&mdash;Cae&s;ar lives and reigns.</L></Q>
<P>Though <HI>my friend in his la&s;t moments</HI> hath in this and other in&s;tances been &s;o con&s;iderate of our happine&s;s, I am afraid he is not likely to leave our morals much better than he found them: I cannot &s;ay that in the cour&s;e of my duty as an <HI>Ob&s;erver</HI> any very &s;triking in&s;tance of amendment hath come under my notice; and though I have all the di&s;po&s;ition in life to &s;peak as favourably in my friend's behalf as truth will let me, I am bound to confe&s;s he was not apt to think &s;o &s;eriou&s;ly of his latter end as I could have wi&s;hed: there was a levity in his conduct, which he took no pains to conceal; he did not &s;eem to reflect upon the lap&s;e of time, how &s;peedily his <HI>&s;pring, &s;ummer,</HI> and <HI>autumn</HI> would pa&s;s away and the <HI>winter</HI> of his days come upon him; like <HI>Wol&s;ey</HI> he was not aware how &s;oon the <HI>fro&s;t, the killing fro&s;t would nip his root:</HI> he was however a gay convivial fellow, loved his bottle and his friend, pa&s;&s;ed his time peaceably among&s;t us, and certainly merits the good word of every loyal &s;ubject in this kingdom.</P>
<P>As for his proceedings in other countries, it
<PB N="4" REF="10">
is not here the reader mu&s;t look for an ac|count of them; politics have no place in the&s;e volumes; but it cannot be denied that he has made many widows and orphans in Europe, been an active agent for the court of death, and dipped his hands deep in Chri&s;tian and Mahometan blood. By the friends of freedom he will be celebrated to the late&s;t time. He has begun a bu&s;ine&s;s, which, if followed up by his &s;ucce&s;&s;or with equal zeal, le&s;s ferocity and more di&s;cre|tion, may lead to wonderful revolutions: there are indeed &s;ome in&s;tances of cruelty, which bear hard upon his character; if &s;eparately viewed, they admit of no palliation; in a general light, allowances may be made for that phren&s;y, which &s;eizes the mind, when impelled to great and arduous undertakings; when the wound is gan|grened the inci&s;ion mu&s;t be deep, and if that is to be done by coar&s;e in&s;truments and un&s;kilful hands, who can wonder if the ga&s;h more re&s;em|bles the &s;tab of an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in than the operation of a &s;urgeon? An aera is now opened, awful, in|tere&s;ting and &s;o involved in my&s;tery, that the acute&s;t &s;peculation cannot penetrate to the i&s;&s;ue of it: In &s;hort, <HI>my friend in his la&s;t moments</HI> hath put a va&s;t machine in motion, and left a ta&s;k to futurity, that will demand the &s;tronge&s;t hands
<PB N="5" REF="11">
and able&s;t heads to compleat: in the mean time I &s;hall hope that my countrymen, who have all tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings by inheritance, which le&s;s-fa|voured nations are now &s;truggling to obtain by force, will &s;o u&s;e their liberty, that the re&s;t of the world, who are not &s;o happy, may think it an object worth contending for, and quote our peace and our pro&s;perity as the be&s;t proofs exi&s;t|ing of its real value.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t my thoughts have been thus employed in reflecting upon the la&s;t day of an ever-memo|rable year, I have compo&s;ed a few elegiac lines to be thrown into the grave, which time is now opening to receive his reliques.</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>The year's gay verdure, all its charms are gone,</L>
<L>And now comes old December chill and drear,</L>
<L>Dragging a darkling length of evening on,</L>
<L>Whil&s;t all things droop, as Nature's death were near.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Time flies amain with broad-expanded wings,</L>
<L>Whence never yet a &s;ingle feather fell,</L>
<L>But holds his &s;peed, and through the welkin rings</L>
<L>Of all that breathe the inexorable knell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh! for a moment &s;top&mdash;a moment's &s;pace</L>
<L>For recollection mercy might concede,</L>

<L>To ponder on that world, to which they &s;peed.</L>

<L>But, 'tis in vain; old Time di&s;dains to re&s;t,</L>
<L>And moment after moment flits along,</L>
<L>Each with a &s;ting to pierce the idler's brea&s;t,</L>
<L>And vindicate its predece&s;&s;or's wrong.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Though the new-dawning year in its advance</L>
<L>With hope's gay promi&s;e may entrap the mind,</L>
<L>Let memory give one retro&s;pective glance</L>
<L>Through the bright period, which it leaves behind,</L>

<L>Thou Freedom's nur&s;ing mother &s;halt be &s;til'd,</L>

<L>A &s;anguine mantle the dread infant wore,</L>

<HEAD>N^o CXXVII.</HEAD>
<P>I Am under promi&s;e to re&s;ume the hi&s;tory of my friend Ned Drow&s;y, from which I was obliged to break off in my la&s;t volume, N^o 122. The events, which have &s;ince occurred, &s;hall now be related.</P>
<P>The reader will perhaps recollect that the worthy Hebrew, who a&s;&s;umes the name of Abrahams, had ju&s;t concluded the narrative of his adventures, and that the next morning was appointed for a conciliatory interview between Mrs. Goodi&s;on and her father. Ned, who&s;e natural indolence had now began to give place to the mo&s;t active of all pa&s;&s;ions, had been &s;o much agitated by the events of the day, that we had no &s;ooner parted from hone&s;t Abrahams, than he began to comment upon the lucky incident of our rencontre with the old gentleman at the comedy; he &s;eemed &s;trongly inclined to deal with de&s;tiny for &s;ome certain impul&s;es, which he remembered to have felt, when he was &s;o earne&s;t to go to the play; and declared with much gra|vity, that he went thither fully prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ome good fortune would turn up:
<Q REND="inline">"Well, to be &s;ure,"</Q>
&s;aid he,
<Q REND="inline">"I ought to rejoice in the
<PB N="9" REF="15">
happy turn affairs have now taken, and I do rejoice; but it would have given me infinite delight to have fulfilled the plan I had in de|&s;ign for Mrs. Goodi&s;on's accommodation; &s;he will now want no a&s;&s;i&s;tance from me; my little cottage will never have the honour of re|ceiving her; all tho&s;e &s;chemes are at an end; Con&s;tantia too will be a great fortune, &s;he will have higher views in life, and think no more of me; or, if &s;he did, it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed her grandfather, who &s;o bitterly re|&s;ented his daughter's match, will &s;uffer her to fall into the offence."</Q>
I mu&s;t confe&s;s I thought &s;o entirely with my friend Ned in the concluding part of the&s;e remarks, that I could only advi&s;e him to wait the event of time, and recommend him&s;elf in the mean while as well as he could to Mr. Somerville, the grandfather of Con&s;tantia. Art and education, it is true, had not contributed much to Ned's accompli&s;hments, but nature had done great things in his favour; to a per&s;on admirably, though not finically, formed, &s;he had given a mo&s;t intere&s;ting &s;et of features, with &s;uch a &s;triking character of bene|volence and open hone&s;ty, that he might be &s;aid to carry his heart in his countenance: though there was a kind of la&s;&s;itude in his deportment,
<PB N="10" REF="16">
the effect of habits long indulged, yet his &s;en&s;ibi|bility was ever ready to &s;tart forth upon the fir&s;t call, and on tho&s;e occa&s;ions no one would have regretted that he had not been trained in the &s;chool of the graces; there was &s;omething then di&s;played, which they cannot teach, and only na|ture in her happie&s;t moments can be&s;tow.</P>
<P>The next morning produced a letter from hone&s;t Abrahams, full of joy for the happy re|conciliation now e&s;tabli&s;hed, and inviting us to celebrate the day with Mrs. Somerville and the ladies at his hou&s;e. This was an anxious cri&s;is for my friend Ned; and I perceived his mind in &s;uch a &s;tate of agitation, that I thought fit to &s;tay with him for the re&s;t of the forenoon: he began to form a variety of conjectures as to the reception he was likely to meet from the old gentleman, with no le&s;s a variety of plans for his own behaviour, and even of &s;peeches with which he was to u&s;her in his fir&s;t addre&s;&s;es; &s;ometimes he &s;unk into melancholy and de&s;pair, at other times he would &s;natch a gleam of hope, and talk him|&s;elf into tran&s;ports; he was now, for the fir&s;t time in his life, &s;tudiou&s;ly contriving how to &s;et off his per&s;on to the be&s;t advantage; his hair was fa&s;hionably dre&s;t, and a hand&s;ome new &s;uit was tried on, during which he &s;urveyed him&s;elf in the
<PB N="11" REF="17">
gla&s;s with &s;ome attention, and, as I thought, not entirely without a &s;ecret &s;atisfaction, which, in|deed, I have &s;een other gentlemen be&s;tow upon their per&s;ons in a much greater degree, with much le&s;s rea&s;on for their excu&s;e.</P>
<P>When he was compleatly equipt, and the time approached for our going, <Q REND="inline">"Alas!"</Q> he cried,
<Q REND="inline">"what does all this &s;ignify? I am but a clown in better clothes. Why was my fa|ther &s;o neglectful of my education, or rather why was I &s;o negligent to avail my&s;elf of the little he allowed me? What would I not give to redeem the time I have thrown away! But 'tis in vain: I have neither wit to recommend my&s;elf, nor addre&s;s to di&s;gui&s;e my want of it; I have nothing to plead in my favour, but common honour and hone&s;ty; and what cares that old hard-hearted fellow for qualities, which could not reconcile him to his own &s;on-in-law? he will certainly look upon me with contempt. As for Con&s;tantia, gratitude, perhaps, might in time have di&s;po&s;ed her heart towards me, and my zealous &s;ervices might have induced her mother to overlook my deficiencies, but there is an end of that only chance I had for happine&s;s, and I am a fool to thru&s;t my&s;elf into a &s;ociety, where I
<PB N="12" REF="18">
am &s;ure to heap fre&s;h fuel on my pa&s;&s;ion, and fre&s;h misfortunes on my head."</Q></P>
<P>With the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions, which I could only &s;ooth but not di&s;pel, Ned proceeded to the place of meeting with an aching heart and dejected countenance. We found the whole party a&s;|&s;embled to receive us, and though my friend's embarra&s;&s;ment di&s;abled him from uttering any one of the ready-made &s;peeches he had dige&s;ted for the purpo&s;e, yet I &s;aw nothing in Mr. So|merville's countenance or addre&s;s, that could augur otherwi&s;e than well for hone&s;t Ned; Mrs. Goodi&s;on was as gracious as po&s;&s;ible, and Con|&s;tantia's &s;mile was benignity it&s;elf. Hone&s;t Abrahams, who has all the ho&s;pitality, as well as virtues of his forefathers the patriarchs, re|ceived us with open arms, and a face in which-wide-mouthed joy grinned mo&s;t delectably. It was with plea&s;ure I ob&s;erved Mr. Somerville's grateful attentions towards him and his good dame; they had nothing of o&s;tentation or arti|fice in them, but &s;eemed the genuine effu&s;ions of his heart; they convinced me he was not a man innately moro&s;e, and that the re&s;entment, &s;o long fo&s;tered in his bo&s;om, was effectually extirpated. Mrs. Abrahams, in her province, had exerted her&s;elf to very good purpo&s;e, and &s;pread her board,
<PB N="13" REF="19">
if not elegantly, yet abundantly: Abrahams, on his part, kept his wine and his tongue going with ince&s;&s;ant gaiety and good-humour, and whil&s;t he took every opportunity of drawing forth Ned's hone&s;t heart and natural manners to the be&s;t advantage, I was happy in di&s;covering that they did not e&s;cape the intuition of Somer|ville, and that he made fa&s;ter progre&s;s towards his good opinion, than if he had exhibited better breeding and le&s;s &s;incerity of character.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the evening the old gentle|man told us he had determined upon taking his daughter and Con&s;tantia into the country with him, where he flattered him&s;elf Mrs. Goodi&s;on would recover her health and &s;pirits &s;ooner than in town, and at the &s;ame time gave us all in turn a pre&s;&s;ing invitation to his hou&s;e. Abrahams and his wife excu&s;ed them&s;elves on the &s;core of bu&s;ine&s;s; but Ned, who had no &s;uch plea to make, nor any di&s;po&s;ition to invent one, thank|fully accepted the propo&s;al.</P>
<P>The day &s;ucceeding, and &s;ome few others, were pa&s;&s;ed by Mrs. Goodi&s;on and Con&s;tantia at Mr. Somerville's in the nece&s;&s;ary preparations and arrangements previous to their leaving Lon|don; during this time Ned's diffidence and their occupations did not admit of any interview, and

their departure was only announced to him by a note from the old gentleman, reminding him of his engagement: his &s;pirits were by this time &s;o much lowered from their late elevation, that he even doubted if he &s;hould accept the invitation: love however took care to &s;ettle this point in his own favour, and Ned arrived at the place of his de&s;tination rather as a victim under the power of a hopele&s;s pa&s;&s;ion, than as a modern fine gentleman with the a&s;&s;uming airs of a conqueror. The charms of the beautiful Con&s;tantia, which had drawn her indolent admirer &s;o much out of his character and &s;o far from his home, now heightened by the happy rever&s;e of her &s;ituation, and &s;et off with all the aids of dre&s;s, dazzled him with their lu&s;tre; and though her change of for|tune and appearance was not calculated to dimi|ni&s;h his pa&s;&s;ion, it &s;eemed to forbid his hopes: in &s;orrow, poverty and dependance &s;he had in|&s;pired him with the generous ambition of re&s;|cuing her from a &s;ituation &s;o ill proportioned to her merits, and, though he had not actually made, he had very &s;eriou&s;ly meditated a propo&s;al of marriage: He &s;aw her now in a far different point of view, and comparing her with him&s;elf, her beauty, fortune and accompli&s;hments with his own con&s;cious deficiencies, he &s;unk into de&s;pair.
<PB N="15" REF="21">
This was not unob&s;erved by Con&s;tantia, neither did &s;he want the penetration to di&s;cern the cau&s;e of it. When he had dragged on this wretched exi&s;tence for &s;ome days, he found the pain of it no longer &s;upportable, and, a&s;hamed of wearing a face of woe in the hou&s;e of happine&s;s, he took the hardy re&s;olution of bidding farewell to Con|&s;tantia and his hopes for ever.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t he was meditating upon this painful &s;ubject one evening during a &s;olitary walk, he was &s;urprized to hear him&s;elf acco&s;ted by the very per&s;on, from who&s;e chains he had determined to break loo&s;e; Con&s;tantia was unattended, the place was retired, the hour was &s;olemn and her looks were &s;oft and full of compa&s;&s;ion. What cannot love effect? it in&s;pired him with re&s;olu|tion to &s;peak; it did more, it &s;upplied him with eloquence to expre&s;s his feelings.</P>
<P>Con&s;tantia in few words gave him to under|&s;tand that &s;he rightly gue&s;&s;ed the &s;ituation of his mind; this at once drew from him a confe&s;&s;ion of his love and his de&s;pair&mdash;of the former he &s;poke little and with no di&s;play; he neither &s;ought to recommend his pa&s;&s;ion, or excite her pity; of his own defects he &s;poke more at large, and dwelt much upon his want of education; he reproached him&s;elf for the habitual indolence of
<PB N="16" REF="22">
his di&s;po&s;ition, and then, for the fir&s;t time, rai&s;|ing his eyes from the ground, he turned them on Con&s;tantia, and after a pau&s;e exclaimed,
<Q REND="inline">"Thank Heaven! you are re&s;tored to a condition, which no longer &s;ubjects you to the po&s;&s;ible &s;acrifice I had once the audacity to hint at. Con&s;cious as I am of my own unworthine&s;s at all times to a&s;pire to &s;uch a propo&s;al, let me do my&s;elf the ju&s;tice to declare that my heart was open to you in the pure&s;t &s;en&s;e; that to have tendered an a&s;ylum to your beloved mo|ther, without en&s;naring your heart by the ob|ligation, would &s;till have been the pride of my life, and I as truly abhorred to exact, as you could di&s;dain to grant, an intere&s;ted &s;urrender of your hand: and now, lovely Con&s;tantia, when I am about to leave you in the bo&s;om of pro&s;perity, if I do not &s;eem to part from you with all that unmixt felicity, which your good fortune ought to in&s;pire, do not reproach me for my unhappy weakne&s;s; but recollect for once in your life, that your charms are irre&s;i&s;ti|ble, and my &s;oul only too &s;u&s;ceptible of their power and too far plunged into de&s;pair, to admit of any happine&s;s hereafter."</Q></P>
<P>At the conclu&s;ion of this &s;peech Ned again fixt his eyes on the ground; after a &s;hort &s;ilence,
<PB N="17" REF="23">
<Q REND="inline">"I perceive,"</Q> replied Con&s;tantia,
<Q REND="inline">"that my ob&s;ervations of late were rightly formed, and you have been torturing your mind with re|flections very flattering to me, but not very ju&s;t towards your&s;elf: believe me, Sir, your opinion is as much too exalted in one ca&s;e, as it is too humble in the other. As for me, hav|ing as yet &s;een little of the world but its mi|&s;eries, and being indebted to the benevolence of human nature for &s;upporting me under them, I &s;hall ever look to that principle as a greater recommendation in the character of a companion for life, than the mo&s;t brilliant ta|lents or mo&s;t elegant accompli&s;hments: in the quiet walks of life I &s;hall expect to find my enjoyments."</Q>
Here Ned &s;tarted from his reverie, a gleam of joy ru&s;hed upon his heart, by an involuntary motion he had gra&s;ped one of her hands; &s;he perceived the tumult her words had created, and extricating her hand from his&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Permit me,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he,
<Q REND="inline">"to qualify my re&s;pect for a benevolent di&s;po&s;ition by remarking to you, that without activity there can be no vir|tue: I will explain my&s;elf more particularly; I will &s;peak to you with the &s;incerity of a friend&mdash;You are ble&s;t with excellent natural endowments, a good heart and a good under|&s;tanding;
<PB N="18" REF="24">
you have nothing to do but to &s;hake off an indolent habit, and, having youth at your command, to employ the one and cul|tivate the other: the means of doing this it would be pre&s;umption in me to pre&s;cribe, but as my grandfather is a man well acquainted with the world and fully qualified to give advice, I &s;hould earne&s;tly recommend to you not to take a ha&s;ty departure before you have con&s;ulted him, and I may venture to promi&s;e you will never repent of any confidence you may repo&s;e in his friend&s;hip and di&s;cretion."</Q></P>
<P>Here Con&s;tantia put an end to the con|ference and turned towards the hou&s;e; Ned &s;tood fixt in deep reflection, his mind &s;ometimes brightening with hope, &s;ometimes relap&s;ing into de&s;pair: his final determination, however, was to obey Con&s;tantia's advice and &s;eek an inter|view with Mr. Somerville.</P>

<P>THE next morning, as &s;oon as Ned and Mr. Somerville met, the old gentleman took him into his library, and when he was &s;eated,
<PB N="19" REF="25">
<Q REND="inline">"Sir,"</Q> &s;aid he,
<Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall &s;ave you &s;ome embar|ra&s;&s;ment if I begin our conference by telling you that I am well appri&s;ed of your &s;entiments towards my Con&s;tantia; I &s;hall make the &s;ame ha&s;te to put you out of &s;u&s;pen&s;e by a&s;&s;uring you that I am not unfriendly to your wi&s;hes."</Q></P>
<P>This was an opening of &s;uch unexpected joy to Ned, that his &s;pirits had nearly &s;unk under the &s;urprize; he &s;tared wildly without power of ut|terance, &s;carce venturing to credit what he had heard; the blood ru&s;hed into his cheeks, and Somerville, &s;eeing his di&s;order, proceeded:
<Q REND="inline">"When I have &s;aid this on my own part, un|der&s;tand, young gentleman, that I only engage not to ob&s;truct your &s;ucce&s;s, I do not, nay I cannot, undertake to en&s;ure it: that mu&s;t de|pend upon Con&s;tantia; permit me to add, it mu&s;t depend upon your&s;elf."</Q>
Here Ned, un|able to &s;uppre&s;s his tran&s;ports, eagerly demanded what there could be in his power to do, that might advance him in the good opinion and e&s;teem of Con&s;tantia; &s;uch was his gratitude to the old gentleman for his kindne&s;s, that he could &s;carce refrain from throwing him&s;elf at his feet, and he implored him in&s;tantly to point out the happy means, which he would implicitly embrace, were they every &s;o difficult, ever &s;o dangerous.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="26"><Q REND="inline">"There will be neither hard&s;hip nor hazard,"</Q> replied Mr. Somerville,
<Q REND="inline">"in what I &s;hall advi&s;e. Great things may be accompli&s;hed in a &s;hort time, where the di&s;po&s;ition is good and the under&s;tanding apt: though your father neg|lected your education, it is no rea&s;on you &s;hould neglect your&s;elf; you mu&s;t &s;hake off your indo|lence; and as the fir&s;t &s;tep nece&s;&s;ary towards your future comfort is to put your&s;elf at ea&s;e in point of fortune, you mu&s;t make your&s;elf ma&s;ter of your own e&s;tate; that I &s;u&s;pect can only be done by extricating your affairs from the hands they are in; but as this is a bu&s;ine&s;s, that will require the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of an hone&s;t and able agent, I &s;hall recommend to you my own lawyer, on who&s;e integrity you may &s;e|curely rely; he will &s;oon reduce your affairs to &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of regularity, that you will find it an ea&s;y bu&s;ine&s;s, and when you di&s;cover how many &s;ources of future happine&s;s it opens to you, you will pur&s;ue it as an employment of no le&s;s plea&s;ure than advantage."</Q></P>
<P>To this good advice Ned promi&s;ed the fulle&s;t and mo&s;t unre&s;erved obedience; Mr. Somerville re&s;umed his &s;ubject and proceeded:
<Q REND="inline">"When you have thus laid the foundation in oeco|nomy, what remains to be done will be a ta&s;k
<PB N="21" REF="27">
of plea&s;ure: this will con&s;i&s;t in, furni&s;hing your mind and enlarging your experience, in &s;hort, Sir, rubbing off the ru&s;t of indolence and the prejudices of a narrow education: now for this important undertaking I have a friend in my eye, who&s;e under&s;tanding, tem|per, morals and manners qualify him to ren|der you mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential &s;ervices: with this ami|able and in&s;tructive companion I &s;hould in the fir&s;t place recommend you to take a tour through the mo&s;t intere&s;ting parts of your own country, and hereafter, as occa&s;ion &s;hall &s;erve, you may, or you may not, extend your travels into other countries: this is the be&s;t coun&s;el I have to give you, and I tender it with all po&s;&s;ible good wi&s;hes for your &s;ucce&s;s."</Q></P>
<P>A plan, propo&s;ed with &s;o much cordiality and holding forth &s;uch a reward for the accompli&s;h|ment of its conditions, could not fail to be em|braced with ardour by the late de&s;pairing lover of Con&s;tantia. The worthy lawyer was pre|pared for the undertaking, and Ned was all im|patience to convince Mr. Somerville, that in|dolence was no longer his ruling defect. He gave in&s;tant orders for his journey, and then flew to Con&s;tantia, at who&s;e feet he poured
<PB N="22" REF="28">
forth the humble, yet ardent, acknowledgments of a heart overflowing with gratitude and love: it &s;eemed as if love's arrow, like <HI>Ithuriel</HI>'s &s;pear, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the magic powers of transformation with a touch: there was a &s;pirit in his eyes, an energy in his motions, an illumination over his whole per&s;on, that gave his form and features a new ca&s;t: Con&s;tantia &s;aw the &s;udden transformation with &s;urprize, and as it evinced the flexibility of his nature and the influence of her own charms, &s;he &s;aw it al&s;o with delight: <Q REND="inline">"So &s;oon!"</Q> was her only reply, when he announced his immediate depar|ture, but tho&s;e words were uttered with &s;uch a ca|dence and accompanied by &s;uch a look, as to the eye and ear of love conveyed more meaning than volumes would contain, unaided by &s;uch expre&s;|&s;ion&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Yes, adorable Con&s;tantia,"</Q> he exclaimed,
<Q REND="inline">"I am now &s;etting forth to give the earlie&s;t proof in my power of a ready and alert obedi|ence to the dictates of my be&s;t advi&s;er; the&s;e few moments, which your conde&s;cen&s;ion in|dulges me with, are the only moments I &s;hall not rigidly devote to the immediate duties of my ta&s;k: in&s;pired with the hope of returning le&s;s unworthy of your attention, I chearfully &s;ubmit to bani&s;h my&s;elf from your &s;ight for a time, content to cheri&s;h in my heart the lovely
<PB N="23" REF="29">
image there impre&s;t, and flattering my&s;elf I have the &s;anction of your good wi&s;hes for the &s;ucce&s;s of my undertaking."</Q>
Con&s;tantia a&s;|&s;ured him he had her good wi&s;hes for every hap|pine&s;s in life, and, then yielding her hand to him, he tenderly pre&s;&s;ed it to his lips and departed.</P>
<P>It would be an unintere&s;ting detail to enu|merate the arrangements, which Ned by the in|&s;tructions of his friendly and judicious agent adopted on his return to Poppy-hall. His affairs had indeed been much neglected, but they were not embarra&s;&s;ed, &s;o that they were ea&s;ily put into &s;uch order and regulation, as gave him full lei&s;ure for pur&s;uing other objects of a more ani|mating nature: with this view he returned to his friend Mr. Somerville, and was again ble&s;t with the pre&s;ence of Con&s;tantia, to whom every day &s;eemed to add new graces: he was wel|comed by all parties in the mo&s;t affectionate man|mer; Mr. Somerville, upon conver&s;ing with his lawyer, received a very flattering report of Ned's activity and attention, nor was he di&s;plea&s;ed to hear from the &s;ame authority, that his e&s;tate and property far exceeded any amount, which the unpretending owner him&s;elf had ever hinted at.</P>
<P>It was now the latter end of April, and Ned had allowed him&s;elf only a few days to prepare for
<PB N="24" REF="30">
his tour, and to form an acquaintance with the amiable per&s;on, who at Mr. Somerville's reque&s;t had engaged to accompany him; their plan was to employ &s;ix months in this excur&s;ion through England and part of Scotland, during which they were to vi&s;it the chief towns and principal ma|nufactories, and Mr. Somerville had further con|trived to lay out their cour&s;e, &s;o as to fall in with the hou&s;es of &s;ome of his friends by the way, where he had &s;ecured them a welcome in &s;uch &s;ocieties, as promi&s;ed no le&s;s profit than amu&s;e|ment to a young per&s;on in the pur&s;uit of experi|ence. Mea&s;ures had been taken to provide equi|page, &s;ervants and all things requi&s;ite for a tra|velling e&s;tabli&s;hment, among&s;t which a few well-&s;elected books were not forgotten, and, thus at length equipt, Ned with his companion, on the fir&s;t morning of the month of May, having taken leave of Mr. Somerville and Mrs. Goodi&s;on, and received a tender adieu from his beloved Con&s;tan|tia, &s;lept reluctantly into his chai&s;e, and left the fine&s;t eyes in the creation to pay the tribute of a tear to the &s;orrows of the &s;cene.</P>
<P>From this period I had heard nothing of his proceedings till a few days ago, when I was fa|voured by him with the following letter, dated from the hou&s;e of Mr. Somerville:
<LETTER>
<PB N="25" REF="31">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I am ju&s;t returned from a &s;ix months tour, in the cour&s;e of which I have vi&s;ited a variety of places and per&s;ons in company with a gentleman, from who&s;e plea&s;ing &s;ociety I have reaped the highe&s;t enjoyment, and, if I do not deceive my&s;elf, no &s;mall degree of pro|fit and in&s;truction.</P>
<P>Before I &s;ate out upon this excur&s;ion I had the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing my private affairs put in &s;uch a train, and arranged upon &s;o clear a &s;y&s;tem, that I find my&s;elf in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a fund of occupation for the re&s;t of my days in &s;uperintending the concerns of my e&s;tate, and intere&s;ting my&s;elf in the welfare and pro&s;pe|rity of every per&s;on, who depends upon me.</P>
<P>When I returned to this charming place, the reception I met with from Mr. Somerville was as flattering as can be conceived; the worthy mother of my beloved Con&s;tantia was no le&s;s kind to me; but in what words can I attempt to convey to you the impre&s;&s;ion I felt on my heart, when I was welcomed with &s;miles of approbation by the ever-adorable ob|ject of my affection? What tran&s;port did it give me, when I found her anxious to enquire into every circum&s;tance, that had occured in the cour&s;e of my travels! none were too mi|nute
<PB N="26" REF="32">
for her notice; &s;he &s;eemed to take an intere&s;t in every thing that had happened to me, and our conver&s;ations were renewed time after time without wearine&s;s on her part, or any pro&s;pect of exhau&s;ting our &s;ubject.</P>
<P>At this time I had no other expectation but of a &s;econd excur&s;ion with the conductor of the fir&s;t, and as that gentleman was in fre|quent conference with Mr. Somerville, I took for granted they were concerting the plan of a foreign tour; and though my heart was every hour more and more fondly attached to Con&s;tantia, &s;o that a &s;eparation from her was painful to reflect on, yet I was re&s;olved at all events not to &s;werve from my engagements with her grandfather, and therefore held my|&s;elf in trembling expectation of another &s;um|mons to go forth: delightfully as the hours pa&s;&s;ed away in her &s;ociety, I dreaded le&s;t any &s;ymptoms of &s;elf-indulgence &s;hould lower me in her opinion, or create &s;u&s;picions in Mr. Somerville and Mrs. Goodi&s;on that I was in any danger of relap&s;ing into my former indo|lence: I therefore &s;eized the fir&s;t opportunity of explaining my&s;elf to tho&s;e re&s;pectable friends, when Con&s;tantia was not pre&s;ent, and, addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to Mr. Somerville, a&s;|&s;ured him that I was not di&s;po&s;ed to forget
<PB N="27" REF="33">
any part of his good advice, nor &s;o much my own enemy as to evade any one of tho&s;e con|ditions, to the performance of which he had annexed the hope of &s;o tran&s;cendant a reward: con&s;cious that he could impo&s;e nothing upon me &s;o hard to do, or &s;o painful to &s;uffer, which &s;uch a prize would not infinitely overbalance, I had no other backwardne&s;s or apprehen&s;ion as to his commands, but what &s;prung from the conviction, that after all my efforts I mu&s;t ever remain unworthy of Con&s;tantia.</P>
<P>I &s;hall never forget Mr. Somerville's reply, nor the action which accompanied it. My good friend, &s;aid he, (leaning over the arm of the chair, and kindly taking me by the hand) it is more than enough for a man to have made one &s;uch fatal error in his life as I have done, one &s;uch unhappy &s;acrifice to the fal&s;e opinions of the world; but though I have heartily repented of this error, I am not &s;o far reformed, as to be without ambition in the choice of a hu&s;band for our Con&s;tantia; no, Sir, I am &s;till as ambitious as ever, but I hope with better judgment and upon better prin|ciples: I will not bate an atom of virtue in the bargain I am to make; I in&s;i&s;t upon the good qualities of the heart and temper to the la&s;t &s;cruple; the&s;e are the e&s;&s;entials which I
<PB N="28" REF="34">
rigidly exact, and all the&s;e you po&s;&s;e&s;s; there are indeed other, many other, incidental ar|ticles, which you may, or you may not, &s;uperadd to the account; but I am contented to &s;trike hands with you on the &s;pot, though you &s;hall never have &s;et foot upon foreign &s;oil.&mdash;What &s;ays my daughter to this?</P>
<P>When I ca&s;t my eyes upon the countenance of the mo&s;t benevolent of women, and &s;aw it turned expre&s;&s;ively upon me, &s;miling through tears, joy palpitated at my heart, whil&s;t &s;he de|livered her&s;elf as follows:&mdash;I were of all beings mo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible, could I withhold my te&s;timony to this gentleman's merits, or my entire a&s;&s;ent to his alliance with my daughter; but as I have ever repo&s;ed perfect confidence in her, and, as far as I was enabled, always con&s;ulted her wi&s;hes, I &s;hould be glad this que&s;tion might be fairly and candidly referred to her unbia&s;&s;ed judgment for deci&s;ion: &s;he is very young; our friend here is neither old in years nor expe|rience; both parties have time before them; &s;hould &s;he be willing to hold off from the married &s;tate for a while, &s;hould &s;he fore&s;ee advantages in our friend's undertaking a &s;econd tour with the &s;ame in&s;tructive a&s;&s;o|ciate, (whether into foreign countries or nearer home) let her be the judge of what is mo&s;t
<PB N="29" REF="35">
likely to conduce to her future happine&s;s in a hu&s;band, and as I am per&s;uaded our friend here will practic&s;e no unfair mea&s;ures for bia&s;&s;ing her judgment, let him con&s;ult Con&s;tantia's wi&s;hes on the ca&s;e, and as &s;he determines &s;o let him act, and &s;o let us agree.</P>
<P>With the&s;e in&s;tructions, which Mr Somer|ville &s;econded, I ha&s;tened to Con&s;tantia, and without he&s;itation or di&s;gui&s;e related to her what had pa&s;&s;ed and reque&s;ted her deci&s;ion. Judge (if it be po&s;&s;ible to judge) of my tran|&s;ports, when that ingenuous, that angelic creature gave me a reply, that left no room to doubt that I was ble&s;t in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her heart, and that &s;he could not endure a &s;econd &s;eparation.</P>
<P>I flew to Mr. Somerville; I fell at the feet of Mrs. Goodi&s;on; I interceded, implored and was accepted. Nothing ever equalled the genero&s;ity of their behaviour. I am now to change my name to Somerville, at that wor|thy gentleman's expre&s;s de&s;ire, and mea&s;ures are already in train for that purpo&s;e. The &s;ame abilities, which I am indebted to for the good condition of my affairs, are employed in perfecting the marriage &s;ettlement, and the period now between me and happine&s;s would
<PB N="30" REF="36">
by any other per&s;on but my&s;elf be termed a very &s;hort one.</P>
<P>Thus am I on the very eve of being ble&s;t with the lovelie&s;t, the divine&s;t object upon earth, and thus have I by the good coun&s;el of my friends (in which number I &s;hall ever rec|kon you) broke the &s;hackles of that unmanly indolence, under which I was &s;inking apace into irretrievable languor and in&s;ignificance. Henceforward I entreat you to regard me as a new man, and believe that with my name I have put off my infirmity. We are in daily expectation of our friendly Abrahams, who is <HI>an I&s;raelite indeed:</HI> your company would round our circle and complete the happine&s;s of</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE antient family of the <HI>Saplings,</HI> whereof your humble &s;ervant is the unworthy repre&s;entative, has been for many genera|tions di&s;tingui&s;hed for a certain pliability of temper, which with &s;ome people pa&s;&s;es for good-humour, and by others is called weakne&s;s; but however the world may differ in de&s;cribing it, there &s;eems a general agreement in the manner of making u&s;e of it.</P>
<P>Our family e&s;tate, though far from contempti|ble, is con&s;iderably reduced from its antient &s;pendor, not only by an unlucky tumble that my grandfather Sir Paul got in the famous Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi &s;cheme, but al&s;o by various lo&s;&s;es, bad debts and incautious &s;ecurities, which have fallen heavy upon the pur&s;es of my predece&s;&s;ors at different times; but as every man mu&s;t pay for his good character, I dare &s;ay they did not repent of their purcha&s;e, and for my part it is a reflection that
<PB N="32" REF="38">

<P>Though I &s;corn the notion of &s;etting my&s;elf off to the public and you by panegyrics of my own penning, (as the manner of &s;ome is) yet I may truly &s;ay without boa&s;ting, that I had the character at &s;chool of being the very be&s;t <HI>fag</HI> that ever came into it; and this I believe every gentleman, who was my contemporary at <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter,</HI> will do me the ju&s;tice to acknowledge: it was a reputation I confe&s;s that I did not earn for nothing, for whil&s;t I worked the clothes off my back and the &s;kin off my bones in &s;couting upon every body's errands, I was pummeled to a mummy by the boys, <HI>&s;hewed up</HI> by the u&s;hers, &s;lead alive by the ma&s;ters and reported for an incorrigible dunce at my book; a report, which under correction I mu&s;t think had &s;ome degree

of inju&s;tice in it, as it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to learn a book I was never allowed to open: in this period of my education I took little food and le&s;s &s;leep, &s;o that, whil&s;t I &s;hot up in &s;tature after the manner of my progenitors, who were a tall race of men, I grew as gaunt as a grey-hound, but having abundantly more &s;pirit than &s;trength, and being <HI>voted</HI> by the great boys to to be what is called <HI>True game,</HI> I was &s;ingled out as a kind of trial-cock, and pitted again&s;t every new comer to make proof of his bottom in fair fighting, though I may &s;afely &s;ay I never turned out upon a quarrel of my own making in all my life.

<P>My mother died of a cold &s;he caught by at|tending &s;ome young ladies on a water-party be|fore I had been a month in the world; and my father never married again, having promi&s;ed her on her death-bed not to bring a &s;tepdame into his family, whil&s;t I &s;urvived: I had the misfortune to lo&s;e him when I was in my twenty-&s;econd year; he got his death at a country canva&s;s for Sir Harry O&s;ier, a very obliging gentleman and nearly related to our family: I attended my fa|ther's corp&s;e to the grave, on which melancholy occa&s;ion &s;uch were the lamentations and bewail|ings of all the &s;ervants in the hou&s;e, that I thought it but a proper return for their affection to his memory to prove my&s;elf as kind a ma&s;ter by continuing them in their &s;everal employs: this however was not altogether what they meant, as I was &s;oon convinced every one among&s;t them had a remon&s;trance to make and a new de|mand to prefer: the butler would have better perqui&s;ites, the footman wanted to be out of livery, the &s;cullion demanded tea-money, and the cook murmured about kitchen-&s;tuff.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="42">Though I was now a &s;ingle being in the world, my friends and neighbours kindly took care I &s;hould not be a &s;olitary one; I was young Indeed and of &s;mall experience in the world, but I had plenty of coun&s;ellors: &s;ome advi&s;ed me to buy hor&s;es they wanted to &s;ell, others to &s;ell hor&s;es they wanted to buy: a lady of great ta&s;te fell in love with two or three of my be&s;t cows for their colour; they were upon her lawn the next day: a gentleman of extraordinary <HI>virt&ugrave;</HI> di&s;covered a picture or two in my collection, that exactly fitted his pannels: an eminent im|prover, whom every body declared to be the fir&s;t genius of the age for laying out grounds, had taken mea&s;ures for tran&s;porting my garden a mile out of my &s;ight, and floating my riche&s;t meadow grounds with a lake of muddy water: as for my man&s;ion and its appendages I am per|&s;uaded I could never have kept them in their places, had it not been that the &s;everal projec|tors, who all united in pulling them down, could never rightly agree in what particular &s;pot to build them up again: one kind friend compli|mented me with the fir&s;t refu&s;al of a mi&s;tre&s;s, whom for rea&s;ons of oeconomy he was obliged to part from; and a neighbouring gentlewoman, who&s;e daughter had perhaps &s;tuck on hand a

<P>In ju&s;tice however to my own di&s;cretion let me &s;ay that I was not ha&s;tily &s;urprized into a &s;erious mea&s;ure by this latter overture, nor did I a&s;k the young lady's hand in marriage till I was verily per&s;uaded by her exce&s;&s;ive fondne&s;s that there were no other means to &s;ave her life. Now whether it was the violence of her pa&s;&s;ion before our marriage, that gave &s;ome &s;hock to her intellects, or from what other cau&s;e it might proceed I know not, certain however it is, that after marriage &s;he became &s;ubject to very odd whims and caprices, and though I made it a point of humanity never to thwart her in the&s;e humours, yet I was &s;eldom fortunate enough to plea&s;e her; &s;o that, had I not been &s;ure to de|mon&s;tration that love for me was the cau&s;e and origin of them all, I might have been &s;o de|ceived by appearances as to have imputed them to aver&s;ion. She was in the habit of deciding upon almo&s;t every action in her life by the inter|pretation of her dreams, in which I cannot doubt her great &s;kill, though I could not always comprehend the principles, on which &s;he applied it; &s;he never failed, as &s;oon as winter &s;et in, to

and action, that mighty give any po&s;&s;ible alarm to her, yet my unhappy awkwardne&s;&s;es were always boding ill luck, and I had the grief of heart to hear her declare in her la&s;t moments, that a capital over&s;ight I had been guilty of in handing to her a candle with an enormous winding-&s;heet appending to it was the immediate occa&s;ion of her death and my irreparable mi&s;|fortune.</P>
<P>My &s;econd wife I married in mere charity and compa&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e a young fellow, whom &s;he was engaged to, had played her a ba&s;e trick by &s;candalou&s;ly breaking off the match, when the wedding clothes were bought, the day appointed for the wedding and my&s;elf invited to it. Such tran&s;actions ever appeared &s;hocking to me, and therefore to make up her lo&s;s to her as well as I was able, I put my&s;elf to extraordinary charges for providing her with every thing hand&s;ome upon our marriage: &s;he was a fine woman, loved &s;hew and was particularly fond of di&s;playing her|&s;elf in public places, where &s;he had an opportunity of meeting and mortifying the young man, who had behaved &s;o ill to her: &s;he took this revenge again&s;t him &s;o often, that one day to my great &s;urprize I di&s;covered that &s;he had eloped from me and fairly gone off with him. There was

&s;omething &s;o unhand&s;ome, as I thought, in this proceeding, that I &s;hould probably have taken legal mea&s;ures for redre&s;s, as in like ca&s;es other hu&s;bands have done, had I not been diverted from my purpo&s;e by a very civil note from the gentleman him&s;elf, wherein he &s;ays&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"That being a younger &s;on of little or no fortune, he hopes I am too much of a gentleman to think of re&s;orting to the vexatious mea&s;ures of the law for revenging my&s;elf upon him; and, as a proof of his readine&s;s to make me all the reparation in his power in an honour|able way, he begs leave to inform me, that he &s;hall mo&s;t re&s;pectfully attend upon me with either &s;word or pi&s;tols, or with both, when|ever I &s;hall be plea&s;ed to lay my commands upon him for a meeting, and appoint the hour and place."</Q></P>
<P>After &s;uch atonement on the part of the offen|der, I could no longer harbour any thoughts of a divorce, e&s;pecially as my younger brother the par&s;on has heirs to continue the family, and &s;eems to think &s;o entirely with me in the bu&s;i|ne&s;s, that I have determined to drop it alto|gether, and give the parties no further mole&s;ta|tion; for, as my brother very properly ob&s;erves, it is the part of a chri&s;tian to forget and to for|give;

<P>AS I have lived long enough to repent of a fatal propen&s;ity, that has led me to commit many offences, not the le&s;s irk&s;ome to my pre|&s;ent

feelings for the &s;ecrecy, with which I con|trived to execute them, and as the&s;e can now be no otherwi&s;e atoned for than by a frank confe&s;&s;ion, I have re&s;olved upon this mode of addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to you. Few people chu&s;e to di&s;play their own characters to the world in &s;uch colours as I &s;hall give to mine, but as I have mangled &s;o many reputations in my time without mercy, I &s;hould be the meane&s;t of mankind if I &s;pared my own; and being now about to &s;peak of a per&s;on, whom no man loves, I may give vent to an acrimony, at which no man can take offence. If I have been trouble&s;ome to others, I am no le&s;s uncomfortable to my&s;elf, and amid&s;t vexa|tions without number the greate&s;t of all is, that there is not one, which does not originate from my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I entered upon life with many advantages na|tural and acquired; I am indebted to my parents for a liberal education, and to nature for no con|temptible &s;hare of talents: my propen&s;ities were not &s;uch as betrayed me into di&s;&s;ipation and ex|travagance: my mind was habitually of a &s;tudi|ous ca&s;t; I had a pa&s;&s;ion for books, and began to collect them at an early period of my life: to them I devoted the greate&s;t portion of my time, and had my vanity been of a &s;ort to be
<PB N="43" REF="49">
contented with the literary credit I had now ac|quired, I had been happy; but I was ambitious of convincing the world I was not the idle owner of weapons, which I did not know the u&s;e of; I &s;eized every &s;afe opportunity of making my preten&s;ions re&s;pected by &s;uch dabblers in the belles lettres, who paid court to me, and as I was ever cautious of &s;tepping an inch beyond my tether on the&s;e occa&s;ions, I &s;oon found my&s;elf credited for more learning, than my real &s;tock amounted to. I received all vi&s;itors in my library, affected a &s;tudious air, and took care to furni&s;h my table with volumes of a &s;elect &s;ort; upon the&s;e I was prepared to de&s;cant, if by chance a curious friend took up any one of them, and as there is little &s;ame to be got by treading in the beaten track of popular opinion, I &s;ometimes took the liberty to be eccentric and paradoxical in my critici&s;ms and cavils, which gained me great re&s;pect from the ignorant, (for upon &s;uch only I took care to practi&s;e this chicanery) &s;o that in a &s;hort time I became a &s;overeign dicta|tor within a certain &s;et, who looked up to me for &s;econd hand opinions in all matters of lite|rary ta&s;te, and &s;aw my&s;elf inaugurated by my flatterers cen&s;or of all new publications.</P>
<P>My trumpeters had now made &s;uch a noi&s;e in
<PB N="44" REF="50">
the world, that I began to be in great reque&s;t, and men of real literature laid out for my ac|quaintance; but here I acted with a coldne&s;s, that was in me con&s;titutional as well as pru|dential: I was re&s;olved not to ri&s;k my laurels, and throw away the fruits of a triumph &s;o cheaply purcha&s;ed: &s;olicitations, that would have flattered others, only alarmed me; &s;uch was not the &s;ociety I delighted in; again&s;t &s;uch attacks I entrenched my&s;elf with the mo&s;t jealous caution: If however by accident I was drawn out of my fa&s;tne&s;&s;es, and trapped unawares into an ambu&s;|cade of wicked wits, I armed my&s;elf to meet them with a triple tier of &s;miles; I primed my lips with &s;uch a ready charge of flattery, that when I had once engaged them in the plea&s;ing contemplation of their own merits, they were &s;eldom di&s;po&s;ed to &s;crutinize into mine, and thus in general I con|trived to e&s;cape undetected. Though it was no ea&s;y matter to extort an opinion from me in &s;uch companies, yet &s;ometimes I was unavoidably entangled in conver&s;ation, and then I was forced to have recour&s;e to all my addre&s;s; happily my features were habituated to a &s;mile of the mo&s;t convertible &s;ort, for it would an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of affected humility as well as tho&s;e of actual contempt, to which in truth it was more conge|nial:
<PB N="45" REF="51">
my opinion, therefore, upon any point of controver&s;y flattered both parties and befriended neither; it was calculated to impre&s;s the com|pany with an idea that I knew much more than I profe&s;t to know; it was in &s;hort &s;o in&s;inuating, &s;o &s;ubmitted, &s;o he&s;itating, that a man mu&s;t have had the heart of Nero to have per&s;ecuted a be|ing &s;o ab&s;olutely inoffen&s;ive: but the&s;e &s;acrifices co&s;t me dear, for they were foreign to my nature, and, as I hated my &s;uperiors, I avoided their &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Having &s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;hed my&s;elf as a critic, I now began to meditate &s;ome &s;ecret at|tempts as an author; but in the&s;e the &s;ame cau|tion attended me, and my performances did not ri&s;e above a little &s;onnet, or a parody, which I circulated through a few hands without a name, prepared to di&s;avow it, if it was not applauded to my wi&s;hes: I al&s;o wrote occa&s;ional e&s;&s;ays and paragraphs for the public prints, by way of try|ing my talents in various kinds of &s;tile; by the&s;e experiments I acquired a certain facility of imi|tating other people's manner and di&s;gui&s;ing my own, and &s;o far my point was gained; but as for the &s;ecret &s;atisfaction I had promi&s;ed my&s;elf in hearing my productions applauded, of that I was altogether di&s;appointed; for though I tried both
<PB N="46" REF="52">
prai&s;e and di&s;prai&s;e for the purpo&s;e of bringing them into notice, I never had the plea&s;ure to be contradicted by any man in the latter ca&s;e, or &s;econded by a living &s;oul in the former: I had circulated a little poem, which co&s;t me &s;ome pains, and as I had been flattered with the ap|plau&s;e it gained from &s;everal of its readers, I put it one evening in my pocket, and went to the hou&s;e of a certain per&s;on, who was much re|&s;orted to by men of genius: an opportunity luckily offered for producing my manu&s;cript, which I was prepared to avow as &s;oon as the company pre&s;ent had given &s;entence in its favour: it was put into the hands of a dramatic author of &s;ome celebrity, who read it aloud, and in a man|ner as I thought that clearly anticipated his di&s;|gu&s;t: as &s;oon therefore as he had fini&s;hed it and demanded of me if I knew the author, I had no he&s;itation to declare that I did not&mdash;Then I pre|&s;ume, rejoined he, it is no offence to &s;ay I think it the mere&s;t tra&s;h I ever read&mdash;None in life, I replied, and from that moment held him in ever|la&s;ting hatred.</P>
<P>Di&s;gu&s;ted with the world I now began to dip my pen in gall, and as &s;oon as I had &s;ingled out a proper object for my &s;pleen, I looked round him for his weak &s;ide, where I could place a

blow to be&s;t effect, and wound him undi&s;|covered: the author abovementioned had a full &s;hare of my attention; he was an irritable man, and I have &s;een him agonized with the pain, which my very &s;hafts had given him, whil&s;t I was foremo&s;t to arraign the &s;currility of the age and encourage him to di&s;regard it: the practi&s;e I had been in of ma&s;king my &s;tile facilitated my attacks upon every body, who either moved my envy, or provoked my &s;pleen.</P>
<P>The meane&s;t of all pa&s;&s;ions had now taken entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my heart, and I &s;urrendered my&s;elf to it without a &s;truggle: &s;till there was a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s about me, that &s;unk me in my own e&s;teem, and when I met the eye of a man, whom I had &s;ecretly defamed; I felt aba&s;hed &s;ociety became painful to me; and I &s;hrunk into retire|ment, for my &s;elf-e&s;teem was lo&s;t; though I had gratified my malice, I had de&s;troyed my comfort; I now contemplated my&s;elf a &s;olitary being at the very moment when I had every requi&s;ite of fortune, health and endowments to have recom|mended me to the world, and to tho&s;e tender ties and engagements, which are natural to man and con&s;titute his be&s;t enjoyments.</P>
<P>The &s;olitude, I re&s;orted to, made me every day more moro&s;e, and &s;upplied me with reflec|tions
<PB N="48" REF="54">
that rendered me intolerable to my&s;elf and unfit for &s;ociety. I had rea&s;on to apprehend, in &s;pite of all my caution, that I was now narrowly watched, and that &s;trong &s;u&s;picions were taken up again&s;t me; when as I was fea&s;ting my jaundiced eye one morning with a certain new&s;|paper, which I was in the habit of employing as the vehicle of my venom, I was &s;tartled at di&s;|covering my&s;elf con&s;picuou&s;ly pointed out in an angry column as a cowardly defamer, and me|naced with per&s;onal cha&s;ti&s;ement, as &s;oon as ever proofs could be obtained again&s;t me; and this threatening denunciation evidently came from the very author, who had unknowingly given me &s;uch umbrage, when he recited my poem.</P>
<P>The &s;ight of this re&s;entful paragraph was like an arrow to my brain: habituated to &s;kirmi&s;h only behind entrenchments, I was ill prepared to turn into the open field, and had never put the que&s;tion to my heart, how it was provided for the emergency: In early life I had not any rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect my courage, nay it was rather forward to meet occa&s;ions in tho&s;e days of inno|cence; but the meanne&s;s, I had lately &s;unk into, had &s;apped every manly principle of my nature, and I now di&s;covered to my &s;orrow, that in tak|ing
<PB N="49" REF="55">
up the lurking malice of an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, I had lo&s;t the gallant &s;pirit of a gentleman.</P>
<P>There was &s;till one alleviation to my terrors: it &s;o chanced that I was not the author of the particular libel, which my accu&s;er had imputed to me; and though I had been father of a thou|&s;and others, I felt my&s;elf &s;upported by truth in almo&s;t the only charge, again&s;t which I could have fairly appealed to it. It &s;eemed to me therefore advi&s;eable to lo&s;e no time in di&s;culpat|ing my&s;elf from the accu&s;ation, yet to &s;eek an interview with this ira&s;cible man was a &s;ervice of &s;ome danger: chance threw the opportunity in my way, which I had probably el&s;e wanted &s;pirit to invite; I acco&s;ted him with all imagin|able civility and made the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;everations of my innocence: whether I did this with a &s;er|vility that might aggravate his &s;u&s;picions, or that he had others impre&s;&s;ed upon him be&s;ides tho&s;e I was labouring to remove, &s;o it was, that he treated all I &s;aid with the mo&s;t contemptuous in|credulity, and elevating his voice to a tone, that petrified me with fear, bade me avoid his fight, threatening me both by words and actions in a manner too humiliating to relate.</P>
<P>Alas! can words expre&s;s my feelings? Is there a being more wretched than my&s;elf? to be

friendle&s;s, an exile from &s;ociety and at enmity with my&s;elf is a &s;ituation deplorable in the ex|treme: let what I have now written be made public; if I could believe my &s;hame would be turned to others' profit, it might perhaps become le&s;s painful to my&s;elf; if men want other motives to divert them from defamation, than what their own hearts &s;upply, let them turn to my example, and if they will not be rea&s;oned, let them be frightened out of their propen&s;ity.</P>

<P>I Am bewildered by the definitions, which me|taphy&s;ical writers give us of the human pa&s;|&s;ions: I can under&s;tand the characters of <HI>Theo|phra&s;tus,</HI> and am entertained by his &s;ketches; but when your profound thinkers take the &s;ubject in hand, they appear to me to dive to the bottom of the deep in &s;earch of that, which floats upon its &s;urface: if a man in the heat of anger would de|&s;cribe
<PB N="53" REF="59">
the movements of his mind, he might paint the tempe&s;t to the life; but as &s;uch de&s;crip|tions are not to be expected, moral e&s;&s;ayi&s;ts have &s;ub&s;tituted per&s;onification in their place, and by the plea&s;ing introduction of a few natural inci|dents form a kind of little drama, in which they make their fictitious hero de&s;cribe tho&s;e follies, foibles and pa&s;&s;ions, which they who really feel them, are not &s;o forward to confe&s;s.</P>
<P>When Mr. Locke in his <HI>E&s;&s;ay on the Human Under&s;tanding</HI> de&s;cribes all pity as partaking of contempt, I cannot acknowledge that he is &s;peaking of pity, as I feel it: when I pity a fel|low creature in pain (a woman, for in&s;tance, in the throes of childbirth) I cannot &s;ubmit to own there is any ingredient of &s;o bad a quality as contempt in my pity: but if the metaphy&s;icians tell me that I do not know how to call my feel|ings by their right name, and that my pity is not pity properly &s;o defined, I will not pretend to di&s;pute with any gentleman, who&s;e language I do not under&s;tand, and only beg permi&s;&s;ion to enjoy a &s;en&s;ation, which I call pity, without indulging a propen&s;ity, which he calls con|tempt.</P>

ridiculed more &s;everely and more &s;ucce&s;sfully than almo&s;t any other; yet it &s;till exi&s;ts, and a few pages perhaps would not be mi&s;applied, if I was to make room for a civil kind of gentleman of this de&s;cription, (by name <HI>Billy Simper</HI>) who, having &s;een his failings in their proper light of ridicule, is willing to expo&s;e them to public view for the amu&s;ement it is hoped, if not for the u&s;e and benefit, of the reader.</P>
<P>I beg leave therefore to introduce Mr. <HI>Billy Simper</HI> to my candid friends and protectors, and &s;hall leave him to tell his &s;tory in his own words.&mdash;</P>
<P>I am the younger &s;on of a younger brother: my father qualified him&s;elf for orders in the uni|ver&s;ity of Aberdeen, and by the help of an in&s;inuat|ing addre&s;s, a &s;oft counter-tenor voice, a civil &s;mile and a happy flexibility in the vertebrae of his back-bone, recommended him&s;elf to the good graces of a right reverend patron, who after a due cour&s;e of attendance and dependance pre&s;ented him to a comfortable benefice, which enabled him to &s;upport a pretty numerous family of children. The good bi&s;hop it &s;eems was pa&s;|&s;ionately fond of the game of che&s;s, and my fa|ther, though the better player of the two, knew how to make a timely move &s;o as to throw the
<PB N="55" REF="61">
victory into his lord&s;hip's hands after a hard battle, which was a triumph very grateful to his vanity, and not a little &s;erviceable to my father's purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>Under this expert profe&s;&s;or I was in&s;tructed in all the &s;hifts and movements in the great game of life, and then &s;ent to make my way in the world as well as I was able. My fir&s;t object was to pay my court to my father's elder bro|ther, the head of our family; an enterprize not le&s;s arduous than important. My uncle Antony was a widower, par&s;imonious, peevi&s;h, and re|clu&s;e; he was rich however, egregiou&s;ly &s;elf-conceited, and in his own opinion a deep philo|&s;opher and metaphy&s;ician; by which I would be under&s;tood to &s;ay that he doubted every thing, di&s;puted every thing and believed nothing. He had one &s;on, his only child, and him he had lately driven out of doors and di&s;inherited for non&s;uit|ing him in an argument upon the immortality of the &s;oul: here then was an opening no prudent man could mi&s;s, who &s;corned to &s;ay his &s;oul was his own, when it &s;tood in the way of his inte|re&s;t: and as I was well tutored beforehand, I no &s;ooner gained admi&s;&s;ion to the old philo&s;o|pher, than I &s;o far worked my way into his good graces, as to be allowed to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
<PB N="56" REF="62">
a truckle-bed in a &s;pare garret of the family man&s;ion: envy mu&s;t have owned (if envy could have looked a&s;quint upon &s;o humble a &s;ituation as mine was) that, con&s;idering what a game I had to play, I managed my cards well; for uncle Antony was an old dog at a di&s;pute, and as that cannot well take place, whil&s;t both parties are on the &s;ame &s;ide, I was forced at times to make battle for the good of the argument, and &s;eldom failed to find Antony as compleatly puzzled with the zig-zaggeries of his metaphy&s;ics, as uncle <HI>Toby</HI> of more worthy memory was with the horn-works and counter&s;carps of his fortifica|tions.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the various topics, from which An|tony's ingenuity drew matter of di&s;pute &s;ome were &s;o truly ridiculous, that if I were &s;ure my reader was as much at lei&s;ure to hear, as I am ju&s;t now to relate them, I &s;hould not &s;cruple the re|cital. One morning having been rather long|winded in de&s;cribing the circum&s;tances of a dream, that had di&s;turbed his imagination in the night, I thought it not ami&s;s to throw in a remark in the way of con&s;olation upon the fallacy of dreams in general. This was enough for him to turn over to the other &s;ide and &s;upport the credit of dreams <HI>totis viribus:</HI> I now thought it advi&s;eable to trim, and took a middle cour&s;e between both extremes
<PB N="57" REF="63">
by humbly conceiving dreams might be &s;ome|times true and &s;ometimes fal&s;e: this he con|tended to be non&s;en&s;e upon the face of it, and if I would undertake to &s;hew they were both true and fal&s;e, he would engage to prove by &s;ound logic they could be neither one nor the other:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"But why do we begin to talk,"</Q> added he,
<Q REND="inline">"before we &s;ettle what we are to talk about? What kind of dreams are you &s;peaking of, and how do you di&s;tingui&s;h dreams?"&mdash;</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"I &s;ee no di&s;tinction between them,"</Q>
I replied;
<Q REND="inline">"Dreams vi&s;it our fancies in &s;leep, and are all, accord|ing to Mr. Locke's idea, made up of the wak|ing man's thoughts."&mdash;</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"Does Mr. Locke &s;ay that?"</Q>
exclaimed my uncle.
<Q REND="inline">"Then Mr. Locke's an impo&s;tor for telling you &s;o, and you are a fool for believing him: wi&s;er men than Mr. Locke have &s;ettled that matter many centuries before he was born or even <HI>dreamt</HI> of; but perhaps Mr. Locke forgot to tell you how many preci&s;e &s;orts of dreams there are, and how to denominate and define them; perhaps he forgot that I &s;ay."</Q>
I confe&s;&s;ed that I neither knew any thing of the matter my|&s;elf, nor did I believe the author alluded to had left any clue towards the di&s;covery.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I thought as much,"</Q> retorted my uncle Antony in a tone of triumph,
<Q REND="inline">"and yet this is
<PB N="58" REF="64">
the man who &s;ets up for an inve&s;tigator of the human under&s;tanding; but I will tell you, Sir, though he could not, that there are neither more nor le&s;s than five &s;everal &s;orts of dreams particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed, and I defy even the &s;even &s;leepers them&s;elves to name a &s;ixth. The fir&s;t of the&s;e was by the Greeks denomi|nated <HI>Oneiros,</HI> by the Latins <HI>Somnium,</HI> (&s;imply a <HI>Dream</HI>) and you mu&s;t be a&s;leep to dream it."</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"Granted,"</Q> quoth I. <Q REND="inline">"What is granted?"</Q> re|joined the philo&s;opher,
<Q REND="inline">"Not that &s;leep is in all ca&s;es indi&s;pen&s;able to the man who dreams."&mdash;</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"Humph!"</Q> quoth I.&mdash;My uncle proceeded.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The &s;econd &s;ort of dreams you &s;hall under|&s;tand was by the afore&s;aid Greeks called <HI>Orama,</HI> by the Latins <HI>Vi&s;io,</HI> or as we might &s;ay a <HI>vi&s;ion</HI>; in this ca&s;e take notice you may be a&s;leep, or you may be awake, or neither, or as it were between both; your eyes may be &s;hut, or they may be open, looking inwards or outwards or upwards, either with &s;ight or without &s;ight, as it plea&s;es God, but the <HI>vi&s;ion</HI> you mu&s;t &s;ee, or how el&s;e can it rightly be called a vi&s;ion?"</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"True,"</Q> replied I,
<Q REND="inline">"there is a &s;ect who are particularly favoured with this kind of vi&s;ions."</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"Prythee, don't interrupt me,"</Q>
&s;aid my uncle, and again went on.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="65"><Q REND="inline">"The third &s;ort of dreams to &s;peak accord|ing to the Greeks we &s;hall call <HI>Chremati&s;mos,</HI> according to the Latins we mu&s;t denominate it <HI>Oraculum,</HI> (an <HI>oracle</HI>); now this differs from a <HI>vi&s;ion,</HI> in as much as it may happen to a man born blind as well as to Argus him&s;elf, for he has nothing for it but to li&s;ten, under&s;tand and believe, and whatever it tells him &s;hall come true, though it never entered into his head to preconceive one tittle of what is told him; and where is Mr. Locke and his wak|ing thoughts here?"&mdash;</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"He is done for,"</Q> I an&s;wered,
<Q REND="inline">"there is no di&s;puting again&s;t an oracle."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The fourth &s;ort,"</Q> re&s;umed he,
<Q REND="inline">"is the <HI>Enup|tion</HI> of the afore&s;aid Greeks and an&s;wers to the Latin <HI>In&s;omnium,</HI> which is in fact a dream and no dream, a kind of <HI>re&s;verie,</HI> when a man do&s;es between &s;leeping and waking and builds ca&s;tles (as we &s;ay) in the air upon the ram|blings of his own fancy."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The fifth and la&s;t &s;ort of dreams is by Greeks and Latins mutually &s;tiled <HI>Phanta&s;ma,</HI> a word adopted into our own language by the greate&s;t poet, who ever wrote in it: now this <HI>phanta&s;ma</HI> is a vi&s;itation peculiar to the fir&s;t mental ab&s;ence or &s;lumber, when the man

fancies him&s;elf yet waking, and in fact can &s;carce be called a&s;leep; at which time &s;trange images and appearances &s;eem to float before him and terrify his imagination. Here then you have all the &s;everal denominations of dreams perfectly di&s;tingui&s;hed and defined,"</Q>
quoth the old &s;ophi&s;t, and throwing him&s;elf back in his chair with an air of triumph, waited for the applau&s;e, which I was not backward in be|&s;towing upon this pedantic farrago of dogmatiz|ing dullne&s;s.</P>
<P>It will readily be believed that my uncle An|tony did not fail to revive his favorite controver&s;y, which had produced &s;uch fatal con&s;equences to his di&s;carded &s;on: in fact he held fa&s;t with tho&s;e antient philo&s;ophers, who maintained the eter|nity of this material world, and as he &s;aw no period when men would not be in exi&s;tence, no moment in time to come when mortality &s;hall cea&s;e, he by con&s;equence argued that there could be no moment in time, when immortality &s;hall commence. There were other points re|&s;pecting this grand &s;tumbling-block of his phi|lo&s;ophy, the human &s;oul, upon which he was equally puzzled, for he &s;ided with Ari&s;totle again&s;t Plato in the unintelligible controver&s;y concerning its power of motion: but whil&s;t
<PB N="61" REF="67">
my uncle Antony was thus unluckily wedded to the wrong &s;ide in all ca&s;es, where rea&s;on ought to have been his guide, in points of mere quibble and &s;ophi&s;try, which rea&s;on has no|thing to &s;ay to, and where a wi&s;e man would take neither &s;ide, he regularly took both, or hung &s;u&s;pended between them like Socrates in the ba&s;ket.</P>
<P>Of this &s;ort was the celebrated que&s;tion&mdash;<HI>Ovumne prius fuerit, an gallina</HI>&mdash;viz: <Q REND="inline">"Whe|ther the egg was anterior to the hen, or the hen to the egg."</Q>&mdash;This enquiry never failed to in|tere&s;t his pa&s;&s;ions in a peculiar degree, and he found &s;o much to &s;ay on both &s;ides, that he could never well determine which &s;ide to be of: at length however, hoping to bring it to &s;ome point, he took up the cau&s;e of Egg ver&s;us Hen, and having compo&s;ed a learned e&s;&s;ay, publi&s;hed it in one of the monthly magazines, as a lure to fu|ture controver&s;iali&s;ts. This e&s;&s;ay he had &s;o often avowed in my hearing, and piqued him&s;elf &s;o highly upon it, that I mu&s;t have been dull indeed not to have under&s;tood how to flatter him upon it: but when he had found month after month &s;lip away, and nobody mounting the &s;tage upon his challenge, he felt angry at the contempt, with which his labours were pa&s;&s;ed over, and
<PB N="62" REF="68">
without imparting to me his purpo&s;e, furni&s;hed the &s;ame magazine with a counter-e&s;&s;ay, in which his former argument was handled with an a&s;perity truly controver&s;ial, and the hen was triumphantly made to cackle over the new-laid egg, decidedly po&s;terior to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>I am inclined to think that if Antony had any partiality, it was not to this &s;ide; but as the &s;e|cond e&s;&s;ay was clearly po&s;terior to the fir&s;t, (whatever the egg may have been to the hen) it had the advantage of being couched in all the &s;pirit of a reply with an agreeable tinge of the malice of one, &s;o that when at length it came down printed in a fair type, and re&s;pectfully po&s;t|ed in the front of the long-wi&s;ht-for magazine, his heart beat with joy, and calling out to me in a lofty tone of counterfeited anger, as he run his eye over it&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"By the horns of Jupiter Ammon,"</Q>
quoth he,
<Q REND="inline">"here is a fellow has the confidence to enter the li&s;ts again&s;t me in the notable que&s;tion of the egg."&mdash;</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"Then I hope you will break that egg about his ears,"</Q>
replied I.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Hold your tongue, puppy, and li&s;t|en,"</Q>
quoth the &s;ophi&s;t and immediately began to read.</P>
<P>At every pau&s;e I was ready with a pooh! or a pi&s;h! which I hooked in with every mark of
<PB N="63" REF="69">
contempt I could give it both by accent and action. At the conclu&s;ion of the e&s;&s;ay my uncle Antony &s;hut the book and demanded what I thought of the author&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Hang him,"</Q> I ex|claimed,
<Q REND="inline">"poor, Grub-&s;treet Garreteer; the fellow is too contemptible for your notice; he can neither write, nor rea&s;on; he is a mere ignoramus, and does not know the commone&s;t rules of logic: he has no feature of a critic about him, but the malice of one."&mdash;</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"Hold your tongue,"</Q>
cried Antony, no longer able to contain him&s;elf,

<P>DRIVEN from my uncle Antony's doors by my unlucky mi&s;take between the hen and her egg, my ca&s;e would have been de&s;perate, but that I had yet one &s;tring left to my bow, and this was my aunt <HI>Mrs. Su&s;anna Simper,</HI> who lived within a few miles of my uncle, but in &s;uch declared ho&s;tility, that I promi&s;ed my&s;elf a fa|vorable reception, if I could but flatter her ani|mo&s;ity with a &s;ufficient portion of invective; and for this I deemed my&s;elf very tolerably qualified, having &s;o much good-will towards the bu&s;ine&s;s, and no &s;light inducements to &s;pur me to it.</P>

I was now fighting with the cur&s;ed drug, and had all the difficulty in life to keep it where it was.

<P>We went down to &s;upper; it was elegantly &s;erved, and my aunt particularly recommended two or three di&s;hes to me; her ho&s;pitality em|barra&s;&s;ed me not a little, for my &s;tomach was by no means reconciled; yet I felt my&s;elf bound in good manners to eat of her di&s;hes and com|mend their cookery; this I did, though &s;orely
<PB N="68" REF="74">
again&s;t the grain, and, whil&s;t my &s;tomach ro&s;e again&s;t its food, I flattered what I nau&s;eated.</P>
<P>A grave, well-looking per&s;onage &s;tood at the &s;ideboard, with whom my aunt entered into conver&s;ation.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"John&s;on,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he,
<Q REND="inline">"I think I mu&s;t lodge my nephew in your room, which is warm and well-aired, and di&s;po&s;e of you in the tape&s;try chamber, which has not lately been &s;lept in."&mdash;</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"Madam,"</Q> replied John&s;on,
<Q REND="inline">"I am ready to give up my bed to Mr. Wil|liam at your command; but as to &s;leeping in the tape&s;try chamber you mu&s;t excu&s;e me."</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"Why?"</Q> replied my aunt,
<Q REND="inline">"what is your ob|jection?"</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"I am almo&s;t a&s;hamed to tell you,"</Q>
an&s;wered John&s;on,
<Q REND="inline">"but every body has his humour; perhaps my objection may be none to the young gentleman, but I confe&s;s I don't chu&s;e to pa&s;s the night in a chamber, that is under an ill name."</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"An ill name for what?"</Q>
demanded the lady.
<Q REND="inline">"For being haunted,"</Q>
an&s;wered the butler,
<Q REND="inline">"for being vi&s;ited by noi&s;es, and rattling of chains and apparitions; the gentleman no doubt is a &s;cholar and can account for the&s;e things; I am a plain man, and don't like to have my imagination di&s;turbed, nor my re&s;t broken, though it were only by my own fancies."</Q>
<PB N="69" REF="75">
<Q REND="inline">"What then is to be done?"</Q> &s;aid my aunt, di|recting her que&s;tion to me;
<Q REND="inline">"John&s;on don't chu&s;e to tru&s;t him&s;elf in a haunted chamber; I &s;hall have my hou&s;e brought into di&s;credit by the&s;e reports: Now, nephew, if you will encounter this gho&s;t, and exorci&s;e the chamber by &s;leep|ing in it a few nights, I dare &s;ay we &s;hall hear no more of it. Are you willing to under|take it?"</Q></P>
<P>I was a&s;hamed to confe&s;s my fears, and yet had no &s;tomach to the undertaking; I was al&s;o afraid of giving umbrage to my aunt, and im|pre&s;&s;ing her with an unfavourable opinion of me; I therefore a&s;&s;ented upon the condition of John|&s;on's taking part of the bed with me; upon which the old lady, turning to her butler, &s;aid,
<Q REND="inline">"Well, John&s;on, you have no objection to this propo|&s;al."</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"Pardon me, madam,"</Q> &s;aid he,
<Q REND="inline">"I have &s;uch objections to that chamber, that I will not &s;leep in it for any body living."</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"You &s;ee he is ob&s;tinate,"</Q>
&s;aid my aunt,
<Q REND="inline">"you mu&s;t even undertake it alone, or my hou&s;e will lie under an ill name for ever."</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"Sooner than this &s;hall be the ca&s;e,"</Q>
I replied,
<Q REND="inline">"I will &s;leep in the chamber by my&s;elf."</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"You are very polite,"</Q>
cried my aunt,
<Q REND="inline">"and I admire your &s;pirit: John&s;on, light my nephew to his
<PB N="70" REF="76">
room."</Q>
John&s;on took up the candle, but ab|&s;olutely refu&s;ed to march before me with the light, when we came into the gallery, where, pointing to a door, he told me that was my chamber, and ha&s;tily made his retreat down the &s;tairs.</P>
<P>I opened the door with no &s;mall degree of terror and found a chamber comfortably and elegantly furni&s;hed, and by no means of that melancholy ca&s;t, which I had pictured to my&s;elf from John&s;on's report of it. My fir&s;t precaution was to &s;earch the clo&s;et; I then peeped under the bed, examined the hangings; all was as it &s;hould be; nothing &s;eemed to augur a gho&s;t, or (which I take to be wor&s;e) the counterfeit of a gho&s;t. I plucked up as good a &s;pirit as I could, &s;aid my prayers and turned into bed: With the darkne&s;s my terrors returned; I pa&s;&s;ed a &s;leeple&s;s night, though neither gho&s;t, nor noi&s;e of any &s;ort mole&s;ted me.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Why,"</Q> &s;aid I within my&s;elf,
<Q REND="inline">"could not I be as &s;incere and peremptory as John&s;on? He takes his re&s;t and is at peace, I am &s;leeple&s;s and in terrors: Though a &s;ervant by condition, in his will he is independant; I, who have not the like call of duty, have not the &s;ame liberty of mind: he refu&s;es what he does not chu&s;e to obey, I obey all things whether I
<PB N="71" REF="77">
chu&s;e them or not; And wherefore do I this? Becau&s;e I am a flatterer: And why did I &s;wal|low a whole nau&s;eous do&s;e to humour my aunt's caprice, which her own chamber-maid, who receives her wages, would not touch with her lips? Becau&s;e I am a flatterer: And what has this flattery done for me, who am a &s;lave to it? what did I gain by it at my uncle's? I was the echo of his opinions, &s;hifted as they &s;hifted, &s;ided with him again&s;t truth, demon&s;tration, rea&s;on and even the evidence of my own &s;en&s;es: Abject wretch, I &s;unk my&s;elf in my own e&s;teem fir&s;t, then lo&s;t all &s;hadow of re&s;pect with him, and was finally expelled from his doors, whil&s;t I was in the very act of pro&s;tituting my own judgment to his gro&s;s ab&s;urdities: And now again, here I am at my aunt's, devoted to the &s;ame mean flattery, that has already &s;o &s;hame|fully betrayed me. What has flattery gained for me here? A bitter harve&s;t truly I have had of it; poi&s;oned by an infernal do&s;e, which I had no plea for &s;wallowing; &s;urfeited by dainties I had no appetite to ta&s;te, and now condemned to &s;leeple&s;s hours within a haunted chamber, which her own dome&s;tic would not con&s;ent even to enter: Fool that
<PB N="72" REF="78">
I am to be the dupe of &s;uch a vapor as flattery! de&s;picable wretch, not to a&s;&s;ert a freedom of will, which is the natural right of every man, and which even &s;ervants and hirelings exerci&s;e with a &s;pirit I envy, but have not the heart to imitate: I am a&s;hamed of my own meanne&s;s; I blu&s;h for my&s;elf in the compari&s;on, and am determined, if I &s;urvive till to-morrow, to a&s;&s;ert the dignity of a man, and abide by the con&s;equences."</Q></P>
<P>In meditations like the&s;e night pa&s;&s;ed away, and the dawn of morning called me from my bed: I ro&s;e and refre&s;hed my &s;pirits with a walk through a mo&s;t charming plantation: I met a countryman at his work&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Friend,"</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline">"you are early at your labour."&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline">"Yes,"</Q> an|&s;wered he,
<Q REND="inline">"'tis by my labour I live, and whil&s;t I have health and &s;trength to follow it, I have nothing to fear but God alone."</Q>
So! thought I, here is a le&s;&s;on for me; this man is no flatterer; then why do I wor&s;hip what a clown de&s;pi&s;es?</P>
<P>I found my aunt ready for breakfa&s;t; &s;he que&s;tioned me about my night's re&s;t; I an|&s;wered her with truth that I had enjoyed no re&s;t, but had neither &s;een nor heard any thing to alarm me, and was per&s;uaded there were no
<PB N="73" REF="79">
grounds for the report of her chamber being haunted.
<Q REND="inline">"I am as well per&s;uaded as your&s;elf of that,"</Q>
&s;he replied;
<Q REND="inline">"I know 'tis only one of John&s;on's whims; but people you know will have their whims, and it was great courte&s;y in you to &s;acrifice a night's re&s;t to his humour: my &s;ervants have been &s;poilt by indulgence, but it is to be hoped they will learn better &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion by your example."</Q>
There was a &s;arca&s;tic tone in my aunt's manner of uttering this, which gave it more the air of ridicule than compliment, and I blu&s;ht to the eyes with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of de&s;erving it.</P>
<P>After breakfa&s;t &s;he took me into her clo&s;et, and, de&s;iring me to &s;it down to a writing table, <Q REND="inline">"Nephew,"</Q> &s;ays &s;he,
<Q REND="inline">"I know my brother Antony full well; he is a tyrant in his nature, a bigot to his opinions, and a man of a mo&s;t perverted under&s;tanding, but he is rich and you have your fortune to make; he can in&s;ult, but you can flatter; he has his weakne&s;&s;es, and you can avail your&s;elf of them; &s;uppo&s;e you write him a penitential letter."</Q>&mdash;I now &s;aw the opportunity pre&s;ent for exerting my new-made re&s;olution, and felt a &s;pirit ri&s;ing within me, that prompted me to deliver my&s;elf as follows.
<Q REND="inline">"No, madam, I will neither gra|tify
<PB N="74" REF="80">
my uncle's pride, nor lower my own &s;elf-e&s;teem, by making him any &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; I de&s;pi&s;e him for the in&s;ults he has put upon me, and my&s;elf for having in &s;ome &s;ort de&s;erved them; but I will never flatter him or any living creature more; and if I am to forfeit your favour by re&s;i&s;ting your commands, I mu&s;t meet the con&s;equences, and will rather tru&s;t to my own labour for &s;upport than de|pend upon the caprice of any per&s;on living; lea&s;t of all on him."</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"Heyday,"</Q> cried my aunt,
<Q REND="inline">"you refu&s;e to write!&mdash;you will not do as I advi&s;e you?"</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"In this particular,"</Q> I re|plied,
<Q REND="inline">"permit me to &s;ay I neither can, nor will, obey you."</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"And you are re&s;olved to think and act for your&s;elf?"</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e I am, and in all ca&s;es, let me add, where my honour and my con&s;cience tell me I am right."</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"Then,"</Q> exclaimed my aunt,
<Q REND="inline">"I acknowledge you for my nephew; I adopt you from this hour;"</Q>
and with that &s;he took me by the hand mo&s;t cordially; <Q REND="inline">"I &s;aw,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he,
<Q REND="inline">"or thought I &s;aw, the &s;ymptoms of an abject &s;pirit in you, and was re&s;olved to put my &s;u&s;picions to the te&s;t; all that has pa&s;t here &s;ince your coming has been done in concert and by way of trial; your haunted chamber,

<P>Thus I have given my hi&s;tory, and if the example of my reformation &s;hall warn others from the contemptible character, which I have fortunately e&s;caped from, I &s;hall be mo&s;t happy, being truly anxious to approve my&s;elf the friend of mankind, and the <HI>Ob&s;erver's</HI> very &s;incere well-wi&s;her.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE celebrated author of the <HI>Rambler</HI> in his concluding paper &s;ays, <HI>I have laboured to refine our language to grammatical purity, and</HI>
<PB N="76" REF="82">
<HI>to clear it from colloquial barbari&s;ms, licentious idioms and irregular combinations: &s;omething per|haps I have added to the elegance of its con&s;truction, and &s;omething to the harmony of its cadence.</HI> I hope our language hath gained all the profit, which the labours of this meritorious writer were exerted to produce: in &s;tile of a certain de|&s;cription he undoubtedly excels; but though I think there is much in his e&s;&s;ays for a reader to admire, I &s;hould not recommend them as a model for a di&s;ciple to copy.</P>
<P>Simplicity, ea&s;e and per&s;picuity &s;hould be the fir&s;t objects of a young writer: Addi&s;on and other authors of his cla&s;s will furni&s;h him with examples, and a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the attainment of the&s;e excellencies; but after all, the &s;tile, in which a man &s;hall write, will not be formed by imitation only; it will be the &s;tile of his mind; it will a&s;&s;imilate it&s;elf to his mode of thinking, and take its colour from the complexion of his ordinary di&s;cour&s;e, and the company he con&s;orts with. As for that di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tic, which the ingenious e&s;&s;ayi&s;t terms very properly <HI>the harmony of its cadence</HI>; that I take to be in|communicable and immediately dependant upon the ear of him, who models it. This <HI>harmony of cadence</HI> is &s;o &s;trong a mark of di&s;crimination
<PB N="77" REF="83">
between authors of note in the world of letters, that we can depo&s;e to a &s;tile, who&s;e modulation we are familiar with, almo&s;t as confidently as to the hand-writing of a corre&s;pondent. But though I think there will be found in the periods of every e&s;tabli&s;hed writer a certain peculiar tune, (whether harmonious or otherwi&s;e) which will depend rather upon the natural ear than upon the imitative powers, yet I would not be under&s;tood to &s;ay that the &s;tudy of good models can fail to be of u&s;e in the fir&s;t formation of it. When a &s;ubject pre&s;ents it&s;elf to the mind, and thoughts ari&s;e, which are to be committed to writing, it is then for a man to chu&s;e whether he will expre&s;s him&s;elf in &s;imple or in elaborate diction, whether he will compre&s;s his matter or dilate it, ornament it with epithets and robe it in metaphor, or whether he will deliver it plainly and naturally in &s;uch language as a well-bred per&s;on and a &s;cholar would u&s;e, who affects no parade of &s;peech, nor aims at any flights of fancy. Let him decide as he will, in all the&s;e ca&s;es he hath models in plenty to chu&s;e from, which may be &s;aid to court his imitation.</P>
<P>For in&s;tance; if his ambition is to glitter and &s;urprize with the figurative and metaphori|cal brilliancy of his period, let him tune his ear
<PB N="78" REF="84">
to &s;ome &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages as the following, where <HI>Doctor John&s;on</HI> in the character of critic and biographer is pronouncing upon the poet <HI>Con|greve.</HI>
<Q REND="inline">"His &s;cenes exhibit not much of hu|mour, imagery or pa&s;&s;ion: his per&s;onages are a kind of intellectual gladiators; every &s;en|tence is to ward or &s;trike, the conte&s;t of &s;martne&s;s is never intermitted; his wit is a meteor playing to and fro with alternate co|ru&s;cations."</Q>
If he can learn to embroider with as much &s;pendor, ta&s;te and addre&s;s as this and many other &s;amples from the &s;ame ma&s;ter exhibit, he cannot &s;tudy in a better &s;chool.</P>
<P>On the contrary, if &s;implicity be his object, and a certain &s;erenity of &s;tile, which &s;eems in uni&s;on with the &s;oul, he may open the <HI>Spectator,</HI> and take from the fir&s;t paper of Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> the fir&s;t paragraph, that meets his eye&mdash;the follow|ing for in&s;tance&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"There is nothing that makes its way more directly to the &s;oul than <HI>Beauty,</HI> which immediately diffu&s;es a &s;ecret &s;atisfac|tion and complacency through the imagina|tion, and gives a fini&s;hing to any thing that is great or uncommon: the very fir&s;t di&s;|covery of it &s;trikes the mind with an in|ward joy, and &s;preads a chearfulne&s;s and de|light through all its faculties."</Q>
Or again
<PB N="79" REF="85">
in the &s;ame e&s;&s;ay.
<Q REND="inline">"We no where meet with a more glorious or plea&s;ing &s;how in nature than what appears in the heavens at the ri&s;ing and &s;etting of the &s;un, which is wholly made up of tho&s;e different &s;tains of light, that &s;how them&s;elves in clouds of a different &s;ituation."</Q>
A florid writer would hardly have re&s;i&s;ted the opportunities, which here court the imagination to indulge its flights, whereas few writers of any &s;ort would have been tempted on a topic merely critical to have employed &s;uch figurative and &s;pendid diction, as that of Doctor John&s;on; the&s;e little &s;amples therefore, though &s;elected with little or no care, but taken as they came to hand, may &s;erve to exemplify my meaning, and in &s;ome degree characterize the different &s;tiles of the re&s;pective writers.</P>
<P>Now as every &s;tudent, who is capable of copying either of the&s;e &s;tiles, or even of com|paring them, mu&s;t di&s;cern on which &s;ide the greater danger of mi&s;carrying lies, as well as the greater di&s;grace in ca&s;e of &s;uch mi&s;carriage, pru|dence will direct him in his out&s;et not to hazard the attempt at a florid diction. If his ear hath not been vitiated by vulgar habitudes, he will only have to guard again&s;t mean expre&s;&s;ions, whil&s;t he is &s;tudying to be &s;imple and per&s;picu|ous;
<PB N="80" REF="86">
he will put his thoughts into language naturally as they pre&s;ent them&s;elves, giving them for the pre&s;ent little more than mere grammatical correction; afterwards, upon a clo&s;er review, he will poli&s;h tho&s;e parts that &s;eem rude, harmonize them where they are unequal, compre&s;s what is too diffu&s;ive, rai&s;e what is low, and attune the whole to that general cadence, which &s;eems mo&s;t grateful to his ear.</P>
<P>But if our &s;tudent hath been &s;mitten with the turbulent oratory of the &s;enate, the acrimonious declamation of the bar, or the pompous elo|quence of the pulpit, and &s;hall take the lofty &s;peakers in the&s;e &s;everal orders for his models, rather than &s;uch as addre&s;s the ear in humbler tones, his pa&s;&s;ions will in that ca&s;e hurry him into the florid and figurative &s;tile, to a &s;ublime and &s;welling period; and if in this he excels, it mu&s;t be owned he accompli&s;hes a great and ar|duous ta&s;k, and he will gain a liberal &s;hare of applau&s;e from the world, which in general is apt to be captivated with tho&s;e high and towering images, that &s;trike and &s;urprize the &s;en&s;es. In this &s;tile the Hebrew prophets write,
<Q REND="inline">"who&s;e di&s;cour&s;e"</Q>
(to u&s;e the words of the learned <HI>Doctor Bentley</HI>)
<Q REND="inline">"after the genius of the Ea&s;tern nations, is thick &s;et-with metaphor and alle|gory;

the &s;ame bold compari&s;ons and dithy|rambic liberty of &s;tile every where occurring&mdash;For when <HI>the Spirit of God came upon them,</HI> and breathed a new warmth and vigour through all the powers of the body and &s;oul; when by the influx of divine light the whole &s;cene of Chri&s;t's heavenly kingdom was re|pre&s;ented to their view, &s;o that their hearts were ravi&s;hed with joy, and their imagina|tions turgid and pregnant with the glorious ideas; then &s;urely, if ever, their &s;tile would be &s;trong and lofty, full of allu&s;ions to all that is great and magnificent in the kingdoms of this world." <BIBL>(Commencement Sermon.)</BIBL></Q>&mdash;And the&s;e flights of imagination, the&s;e effu&s;ions of rapture and &s;ublimity will occa&s;ionally be found in the pulpit eloquence of &s;ome of our mo&s;t correct and temperate writers; witne&s;s that brilliant apo&s;trophe at the conclu&s;ion of the ninth di&s;cour&s;e of <HI>Bi&s;hop Sherlock,</HI> than whom few or none have written with more didactic brevity and &s;implicity&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Go,"</Q> (&s;ays he to the Dei&s;ts)

When &s;he is tired with this pro&s;pect, then &s;hew her the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, humble and meek, doing good to all the &s;ons of men, patiently in&s;tructing both the ignorant and perver&s;e; let her &s;ee him in his mo&s;t retired privacies; let her follow him to the mount, and hear his devotions and &s;uppli|cations to God; carry her to his table to view his poor fare, and hear his heavenly di&s;cour&s;e: Let her &s;ee him injured but not provoked; let her attend him to the tribunal, and con&s;i|der the patience with which he endured the &s;coffs and reproaches of his enemies: Lead her to his cro&s;s, and let her view him in the agony of death, and hear his la&s;t prayer for his per&s;ecutors&mdash;<HI>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>This is a lofty pa&s;&s;age in the high imperative tone of declamation; it is richly coloured, boldly
<PB N="83" REF="89">
contra&s;ted and replete with imagery, and is among&s;t the &s;tronge&s;t of tho&s;e in&s;tances, where the orator addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to the &s;en&s;es and pa&s;&s;ions of his hearers: But let the di&s;ciple tread this path with caution; let him wait the call, and be &s;ure he has an occa&s;ion worthy of his ef|forts before he makes them.</P>
<P>Allegory, per&s;onification and metaphor will pre&s;s upon his imagination at certain times, but let him &s;oberly con&s;ult his judgment in tho&s;e mo|ments, and weigh their fitne&s;s before he admits them into his &s;tile. As for allegory, it is at be&s;t but a kind of fairy form; it is hard to natura|lize it and it will rarely fill a graceful part in any manly compo&s;ition. With re&s;pect to per&s;onifi|cation, as I am &s;peaking of pro&s;e only, it is but an exotic ornament, and may be con&s;idered ra|ther as the loan of the mu&s;es than as the pro|perty of pro&s;e; let our &s;tudent therefore beware how he borrows the feathers of the jay, le&s;t his unnatural finery &s;hould only &s;erve to make him pointed at and de&s;pi&s;ed. Metaphor, on the other hand, is common property, and he may take his &s;hare of it, provided he has di&s;cretion not to abu&s;e his privilege, and neither &s;urfeits the appetite with repletion, nor confounds the palate with too much variety: Let his metaphor be

<P>I HAVE a habit of dealing in the marvel|lous, which I cannot overcome: Some peo|ple, who &s;eem to take a plea&s;ure in magnifying the little flaws to be found in all characters, call this by a name, which no gentleman ought to u&s;e, or likes to hear: The fact is, I have &s;o much tender con&s;ideration for Truth in her &s;tate of nakedne&s;s, that, till I have put her into de|cent cloathing, I cannot think of bringing her into company; and if her appearance is &s;ome|times &s;o much altered by dre&s;s, that her be&s;t friends cannot find her out, am I to blame for that?</P>
<P>There is a matter-of-fact man of my acquain|tance, who haunts me in all places and is the very torment of my life; he &s;ticks to me as the thre&s;her does to the whale, and is the perfect

night-mare of my imagination; this fellow never lets one of my &s;tories pa&s;s without dock|ing it like an attorney's bill before a ma&s;ter in chancery: He cut forty miles out of a journey of one hundred, which but for him I had per|formed in one day upon the &s;ame hor&s;e; in which I confe&s;s I had &s;tretched a point for the plea&s;ure of out-riding a fat fellow in company, who by the malicious veracity of my afore&s;aid <HI>Damper</HI> threw me at lea&s;t ten miles di&s;tance be|hind him.</P>
<P>This provoking animal cut up my &s;ucce&s;s in &s;o many intrigues and adventures, that I was determined to lay my plan out of his reach in a &s;pot, which I had provided for an evil day, and accordingly I led him a dance into Cor&s;ica, where I was &s;ure he could not follow me: Here I had certainly been, and knew my ground well enough to prance over it at a very hand&s;ome rate: I noticed a kind of &s;ly leer in &s;ome of the company, which was pointed towards a gentle|man pre&s;ent, who was a &s;tranger to me, and &s;o far from joining in the titter was very politely attentive to what I was relating.

<P>The very next morning I took my pa&s;&s;age in the &s;tage-coach for my native town in the north of England, heartily out of humour with my trip to Cor&s;ica; but even here I could not &s;hake off old habits &s;o far as to re&s;i&s;t the temptation of getting into a po&s;t-chai&s;e for the la&s;t &s;tage, by which manoeuvre I took the credit of having travelled like a gentleman, and became intitled to rail again&s;t the po&s;t-tax and the expences of the road.</P>
<P>I was now voted into a club of the chief in|habitants of the place, and as I had no rea&s;on to believe the &s;tory of my late di&s;comfiture had reached them, I &s;oon recovered my &s;pirits, and

with them the amplifying powers of my inven|tion. My &s;tories for a con&s;iderable time were &s;wallowed &s;o glibly, and &s;eemed to &s;it &s;o ea&s;y on the &s;tomachs of the&s;e natural, un&s;ophi&s;ticated people, that I was encouraged to encrea&s;e the do&s;e to &s;uch a degree, as &s;eemed at length to produce &s;omething like a nau&s;ea with tho&s;e I admini&s;tered it to; e&s;pecially with a certain preci&s;e per&s;onage of the &s;ect of Quakers, one <HI>Simon Stiff,</HI> a weal|thy trader and much re&s;pected for his probity and fair-dealing. <HI>Simon</HI> had a way of a&s;king me at the end of a &s;tory&mdash;<HI>But is it true?</HI>&mdash;which &s;ome|times di&s;concerted me, and con&s;iderably le&s;&s;ened the applau&s;es, that the re&s;t of the club had been accu&s;tomed to be&s;tow upon my narratives.</P>
<P>One evening, when I had been de&s;cribing an enormous &s;hark, by which I had been attacked in one of my We&s;t-India voyages, <HI>Simon Stiff,</HI> lifting up both his hands in an attitude of a&s;to|ni&s;hment, cried out&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Verily, friend <HI>Cracker,</HI> thou drawe&s;t a long bow."</Q>

<P>I am &s;candalized when I hear people &s;ay that the fine arts are protected in this country; nothing can be further from the truth, as I am one among&s;t many to witne&s;s. Painting I pre|&s;ume will not be di&s;puted to be one of the fine arts, and I may &s;ay without vanity I have &s;ome preten&s;ions to rank with the be&s;t of my brethren in that profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>My fir&s;t &s;tudies were carried on in the capital of a certain county, where I was born; and being determined to chu&s;e a &s;triking &s;ubject for
<PB N="100" REF="106">
my <HI>deb&ucirc;t</HI> in the branch of portrait-painting, I per&s;waded my grandmother to &s;it to me, and I am bold to &s;ay there was great merit in my pic|ture, con&s;idering it as a maiden production; particularly in the execution of a hair-mole upon her chin, and a wart under her eye, which I touched to &s;uch a nicety, as to make every body &s;tart, who ca&s;t their eyes upon the canva&s;s.</P>
<P>There was a little dwarfi&s;h lad in the pari&s;h, who be&s;ides the deformity of his per&s;on, had a remarkable hare-lip, which expo&s;ed to view a broken row of di&s;coloured teeth, and was indeed a very brilliant &s;ubject for a painter of effect: I gave a full-length of him, that was executed &s;o to the life, as to turn the &s;tomach of every body, who looked upon it.</P>
<P>At this time there came into our town a tra|velling &s;how-man, who among&s;t other curio&s;ities of the &s;avage kind brought with him a man-ape, or Ourong-outong; and this per&s;on, having &s;een and admired my portrait of the little hump|backed dwarf, employed me to take the figure of his celebrated &s;avage for the purpo&s;e of di&s;|playing it on the out&s;ide of his booth. Such an occa&s;ion of introducing my art into notice &s;purred my genius to extraordinary exertions, and though I mu&s;t premi&s;e that the &s;avage was
<PB N="101" REF="107">
not the be&s;t &s;itter in the world, yet I flatter my&s;elf I acquitted my&s;elf to the &s;atisfaction of his keeper and did ju&s;tice to the ferocity of my &s;ubject: I caught him in one of his mo&s;t &s;trik+ing attitudes, &s;tanding erect with a huge club in his paw: I put every mu&s;cle into play, and threw &s;uch a terrific dignity into his features, as would not have di&s;graced the character of a <HI>Nero</HI> or <HI>Caligula.</HI> I was happy to ob&s;erve the general notice, which was taken of my perform|ance by all the country folks, who re&s;orted to the &s;how, and I believe my employer had no cau&s;e to repent of having &s;et me upon the work.</P>
<P>The figure of this animal with the club in his paw &s;ugge&s;ted a hint to a publican in the place of treating his ale-hou&s;e with a new &s;ign, and as he had been in the &s;ervice of a noble family, who from antient time have borne the <HI>Bear and ragged &s;taff</HI> for their ere&s;t, he gave me a com|mi&s;&s;ion to provide him with a &s;ign to that effect: Though I &s;pared no pains to get a real bear to &s;it to me for his portrait, my endeavours proved abortive, and I was forced to re&s;ort to &s;uch common prints of that animal as I could obtain, and tru&s;ted to my imagination for &s;upplying what el&s;e might be wanted for the piece: As I
<PB N="102" REF="108">
worked upon this capital de&s;ign in the room, where my grandmother's portrait was before my eyes, it occurred to me to introduce the &s;ame hair-mole into the whi&s;kers of Bruin, which I had &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully copied from her chin, and certainly the thought was a happy one, for it had a picture&s;que effect; but in doing this I was naturally enough, though unde&s;ignedly, betrayed into giving &s;uch a general re&s;emblance to the good dame in the re&s;t of Bruin's features, that when it came to be exhibited on the &s;ign-po&s;t all the people cried out upon the likene&s;s, and a malicious rumour ran through the town, that I had painted my grandmother in&s;tead of the bear; which lo&s;t me the favour of that indulgent relation, though Heaven knows I was as inno|cent of the intention as the child unborn.</P>
<P>The di&s;gu&s;t my grandmother conceived again&s;t her likene&s;s with the ragged &s;taff, gave me incredible unea&s;ine&s;s, and as &s;he was a good cu&s;tomer to the landlord and much re&s;pected in the place, he was induced to return the bear upon my hands. I am now thinking to what u&s;e I can turn him, and as it occurs to me, that by throwing a little more authority into his features, and gilding his chain, he might very po&s;&s;ibly hit the likene&s;s of &s;ome lord mayor of
<PB N="103" REF="109">

<P>As I have al&s;o pre&s;erved a &s;ketch of my famous Ourong-Outong, a thought has &s;truck me that with a few fini&s;hing touches he might ea&s;ily be converted into a <HI>Caliban</HI> for <HI>the Tempe&s;t,</HI> and, when that is done, I &s;hall not totally de&s;pair of his obtaining a niche in the Shak&s;pere gallery.</P>

<P>Before I conclude I &s;hall beg leave to ob&s;erve, that I have a compleat &s;et of ready-made devils, that would do honour to Saint Antony, or any other per&s;on, who may be in want of &s;uch ac|companiments to &s;et off the &s;elf-denying virtues

of his character: I have al&s;o a fine parcel of murdered innocents, which I meant to have filled up with the &s;tory of Herod; but if any gentleman thinks fit to lay the &s;cene in Ghent, and make a modern compo&s;ition of it, I am bold to &s;ay my pretty babes will not di&s;grace the pathos of the &s;ubject, nor violate the <HI>Co&s;tuma.</HI> I took a notable &s;ketch of a man hanging, and &s;eized him ju&s;t in the dying twitches, before the la&s;t &s;tretch gave a &s;tiffne&s;s and rigidity unfavour|able to the human figure; this I would willingly accommodate to the wi&s;hes of any lady, who is de&s;irous of pre&s;erving a portrait of her lover, friend or hu&s;band in that intere&s;ting attitude.</P>

<P>THE humours and characters of a popu|lous county town at a di&s;tance from the capital furni&s;h matter of much amu&s;ement to a curious ob&s;erver. I have now been &s;ome weeks re&s;ident in a place of this de&s;cription, where I have been continually treated with the private lives and little &s;candalizing anecdotes of almo&s;t every per&s;on of any note in it. Having pa&s;&s;ed mo&s;t of my days in the capital, I could not but remark the &s;triking difference between it and the&s;e &s;ubordinate capitals in this particular: in London we are in the habit of looking to our own affairs, and caring little about tho&s;e, with whom we have no dealings: here every body's bu&s;ine&s;s &s;eems to be no le&s;s his neighbour's con|cern than his own: A &s;et of tattling go&s;&s;ips (including all the idlers in the place male as well
<PB N="106" REF="112">
as female) &s;eem to have no other employment for their time or tongue, but to run from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, and circulate their &s;illy &s;tories up and down. A few of the&s;e contemptible impertinents I &s;hall now de&s;cribe.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Penelope Tabby</HI> is an antiquated maiden of at lea&s;t forty years &s;tanding, a great ob&s;erver of decorum, and particularly hurt by the behaviour of two young ladies, who are her next-door neighbours, for a cu&s;tom they have of lolling out of their windows and talking to fellows in the &s;treet: The charge cannot be denied, for it is cer|tainly a practice the&s;e young ladies indulge them|&s;elves in very freely; but on the other hand it mu&s;t be owned Mi&s;s Pen Tabby is al&s;o in the habit of lolling out of her window at the &s;ame time to &s;tare at them, and put them to &s;hame for the levity of their conduct: They have al&s;o the crime proved upon them of being unpardonably hand&s;ome, and this they neither can nor will attempt to con|tradict. Mi&s;s Pen Tabby is extremely regular at morning prayers, but &s;he complains heavily of a young &s;taring fellow in the pew next to her own, who violates the &s;olemnity of the &s;ervice by ogling her at her devotions: He has a way of leaning over the pew, and dangling a white hand ornamented with a flaming pa&s;te ring, which
<PB N="107" REF="113">
&s;ometimes plays the lights in her eyes, &s;o as to make them water with the reflection, and Mi&s;s Pen has this very natural remark ever ready on the occa&s;ion&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Such things, you know, are apt to take off one's attention."</Q></P>
<P>Another of this illu&s;trious junto is <HI>Billy Bachelor,</HI> an old unmarried petit-maitre: Billy is a courter of antient &s;tanding; he abounds in anecdotes not of the fre&s;he&s;t date, nor altogether of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting &s;ort; for he will tell you how &s;uch and &s;uch a lady was dre&s;&s;ed, when he had the honour of handing her into the drawing-room; he has a court-atalantis of his own, from which he can favour you with &s;ome hints of &s;ly doings among&s;t maids of honour, particularly of a certain dubious duche&s;s now decea&s;ed, (for he names no names) who appeared at a certain ma&s;querade <HI>in puris naturalibus,</HI> and other won|derful di&s;coveries, which all the world has long ago known, and long ago been tired of. Billy has a &s;mattering in the fine arts, for he can nett pur&s;es and make admirable coffee and write &s;onnets; he has the be&s;t receipt in nature for a dentifrice, which he makes up with his own hands, and gives to &s;uch ladies, as are in his favour and have an even row of teeth: He can boa&s;t &s;ome &s;kill in mu&s;ic, for he plays Barberini's
<PB N="108" REF="114">
minuet to admiration, and accompanies the airs in the Beggar's opera on his flute in their origi|nal ta&s;te: He is al&s;o a playhou&s;e critic of no mean preten&s;ions, for he remembers Mrs. Wof|fington, and Quin and Mrs. Cibber; and when the players come to town, Billy is greatly looked up to, and has been known to lead a clap, where nobody but him&s;elf could find a rea&s;on for clap|ping at all. When his vanity is in the cue, Billy Bachelor can talk to you of his amours, and upon occa&s;ion &s;tretch the truth to &s;ave his credit; particularly in accounting for a certain old lamene&s;s in his knee-pan, which &s;ome, who are in the &s;ecret, know was got by being kicked out of a coffee-hou&s;e, but which to the world at large he a&s;&s;erts was incurred by leaping out of a window to &s;ave a lady's reputation, and e&s;cape the fury of an enraged hu&s;band.</P>
<P><HI>Dr. Pyeball</HI> is a dignitary of the church, and a mighty proficient in the <HI>belles lettres:</HI> He tells you Voltaire was a man of &s;ome fancy and had a knack of writing, but he bids you beware of his principles, and doubts if he had any more chri&s;tianity than Pontius Pilate: He has wrote an epigram again&s;t a certain contemporary hi&s;|torian, which cuts him up at a &s;troke. By a happy jargon of profe&s;&s;ional phra&s;es with a kind
<PB N="109" REF="115">
of Socratic mode of arguing, he has &s;o bam|boozled the dons of the cathedral as to have ef|fected a total revolution in their church mu&s;ic, making Purcell, Crofts and Handel give place to a quaint, quirki&s;h &s;tile, little le&s;s capricious than if the organi&s;t was to play cotillons and the dean and chapter dance to them. The doctor is a mighty admirer of tho&s;e ingenious publica|tions, which are intitled <HI>The flowers</HI> of the &s;everal authors they are &s;elected from; this &s;hort cut to Parna&s;&s;us not only &s;aves him a great deal of round-about riding, but &s;upplies him with many an apt couplet for off-hand quotations, in which he is very expert and has be&s;ides a clever knack of weaving them into his pulpit e&s;&s;ays (for I will not call them &s;ermons) in much the &s;ame way as <HI>Tiddy-Doll</HI> &s;tuck plumbs on <HI>his &s;hort pigs and his long pigs and his pigs with a curley tail.</HI> By a proper &s;prinkling of the&s;e &s;piritual no&s;egays, and the recommenda|tion of a &s;oft in&s;inuating addre&s;s, doctor Pyeball is univer&s;ally cried up as a very pretty genteel preacher, one who under&s;tands the politene&s;s of the pulpit and does not &s;urfeit well-bred people with more religion than they have &s;tomachs for. Amiable Mi&s;s <HI>Pen Tabby</HI> is one of his warme&s;t admirers, and declares Doctor Pyeball in his
<PB N="110" REF="116">
gown and ca&s;&s;ock is quite the man of fa&s;hion: The ill-natured world will have it &s;he has con|templated him in other &s;ituations with equal ap|probation.</P>
<P>Elegant Mrs. <HI>Dainty</HI> is another ornament of this charming coterie: She is &s;eparated from her hu&s;band, but the eye of malice never &s;pied a &s;peck upon her virtue; his manners were in|&s;upportable; &s;he, good lady, never gave him the lea&s;t provocation, for &s;he was always &s;ick and mo&s;tly confined to her chamber in nur&s;ing a delicate con&s;titution: Noi&s;es racked her head; company &s;hook her nerves all to pieces; in the country &s;he could not live, for country doctors and apothecaries knew nothing of her ca&s;e; in London &s;he could not &s;leep, unle&s;s the whole &s;treet was littered with &s;traw. Her hu&s;band was a man of no refinement; <HI>all the fine feelings of the human heart</HI> were heathen Greek to him; he loved his friend, had no quarrel with his bot|tle, and, coming from his club one night a little flu&s;tered, his horrid dalliances threw Mrs. Dainty into &s;trong hy&s;terics, and the covenanted truce being now broken, &s;he kept no further terms with him and they &s;eparated. It was a &s;tep of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, for &s;he declares her life could no otherwi&s;e have been &s;aved; his boi&s;terous
<PB N="111" REF="117">
familiarities would have been her death. She now leads an uncontaminated life, &s;upporting a feeble frame by medicine, &s;ipping her tea with her dear quiet friends every evening, chatting over the little news of the day, &s;ighing charita|bly when &s;he hears any evil of her kind neigh|bours, turning off her femme-de-chambre once a week or thereabouts, fondling her lap-dog, who is a dear &s;weet pretty creature and &s;o &s;en&s;i|ble, and taking the air now and then on a pillion behind faithful John, who is &s;o careful of her, and &s;o handy, and at the &s;ame time one of the &s;toute&s;t, hand&s;ome&s;t, be&s;t-limbed lads in all England.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Hugo Fitz-Hugo</HI> is a decayed baronet of a family &s;o very antient, that they have long &s;ince worn out the e&s;tate that &s;upported them: Sir Hugo knows his own dignity none the le&s;s, and keeps a little &s;nivelling boy, who can &s;carce move under the load of wor&s;ted lace, that is plai&s;tered down the edges and &s;eams of his livery: He leaves a vi&s;iting card at your door, &s;tuck as full of emblems as an American paper dollar. Sir Hugo abominates a trade&s;man; his olfactory nerves are tortured with the &s;cent of a grocer, or a butcher, quite acro&s;s the way, and as for a tallow-chandler he can wind him to the very
<PB N="112" REF="118">
end of the &s;treet; the&s;e are people, who&s;e vi&s;its he cannot endure; their very bills turn his &s;tomach up&s;ide down. Sir Hugo inveighs again&s;t modern manners as &s;everely as Cato would again&s;t French cookery; he notes down omi&s;&s;ions in punctilio as a merchant does bills for prote&s;ting; and in cold weather Sir Hugo is of &s;ome u&s;e, for he &s;uffers no man to turn his back to the fire and &s;creen it from the company who &s;it round: He holds it for a &s;oleci&s;m in good-breeding for any man to touch a lady's hand without his glove: This as a general maxim Mi&s;s <HI>Pen Tabby</HI> agrees to, but doubts whether there are not &s;ome ca&s;es when it may be waved: He anathematizes the here&s;y of a gentle|man's &s;itting at the head of a lady's table, and contends that the honours of the upper di&s;h are the unalienable rights of the mi&s;tre&s;s of the family: In &s;hort, Sir Hugo Fitz-Hugo has more pride about him than he knows how to di&s;po&s;e of, and yet cannot find in his heart to be&s;tow one atom of it upon hone&s;ty: From the world he merits no other prai&s;e but that of having lived &s;ingle all his life, and, being the la&s;t of his family; at his decea&s;e the Fitz-Hugos will be extinct.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="119">This &s;ociety may al&s;o boa&s;t a tenth mu&s;e in the per&s;on of the celebrated <HI>Rhodope:</HI> Her ta|lents are multifarious; poetical, biographical, epi&s;tolary, mi&s;cellaneous: She can rea&s;on like Socrates, di&s;pute like Ari&s;totle and love like Sap|pho; her magnanimity equals that of Marc An|tony, for when the world was at her feet, &s;he &s;acrificed it <HI>all for love,</HI> and accounted it <HI>well lo&s;t.</HI> She was a philo&s;opher in her leading-&s;trings, and had travelled geographically over the globe ere &s;he could &s;et one foot fairly before the other: Her cradle was rocked to the Iambic mea&s;ure, and &s;he was lulled to &s;leep by &s;inging to her an ode of Horace. Rhodope has written a book of travels full of mo&s;t enchanting inci|dents, which &s;ome of her admirers &s;ay was actu|ally &s;ketched in the nur&s;ery, and only filled up with little temporary touches in her riper years; I know they make appeal to her &s;tile as internal evidence of what they a&s;&s;ert about the nur&s;ery; but though I am ready to admit that it has every infantine charm, which they di&s;cover in it, yet I cannot go the length of thinking with them, that a mere infant could po&s;&s;ibly dictate any thing &s;o nearly approaching to the language of men and women: We all know that <HI>Goody Two-&s;hoes,</HI> and other amu&s;ing books, though written for
<PB N="114" REF="120">
children, were not written by children. Rhodo|pe has pre&s;erved &s;ome &s;ingular curio&s;ities in her mu&s;eum: She has a bottle of coagulated foam, &s;omething like the congealed blood of Saint Ja|nuarius; this &s;he maintains was the veritable foam of the tremendous Minotaur of Crete of immortal memory; there are &s;ome indeed, who profe&s;s to doubt this, and a&s;&s;ert that it is nothing more than the &s;laver of a noble Engli&s;h ma&s;tiff, which went tame about her hou&s;e, and, though formidable to thieves and interlopers, was ever gentle and affectionate to hone&s;t men. She has a lyre in fine pre&s;ervation, held to be the identi|cal lyre, which <HI>Phaon</HI> played upon, when he won the heart of the amorous <HI>Sappho</HI>; this al&s;o is made matter of di&s;pute among&s;t the <HI>cogno&s;centi</HI>; the&s;e will have it to be a common Italian in&s;tru|ment, &s;uch as the ladies of that country play upon to this day; this is a point they mu&s;t &s;ettle as they can, but all agree it is a well-&s;trung in&s;tru|ment, and <HI>di&s;cour&s;es &s;weet mu&s;ic.</HI> She has in her cabinet an evergreen of the cypre&s;s race, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the very individual &s;hrub, that led up the ball when Orpheus fiddled and the groves began a vegetable dance; and this they tell you was the origin of all country dances, now in &s;uch general practice. She has al&s;o in
<PB N="115" REF="121">
her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion the original epi&s;tle, which king <HI>Agenor</HI> wrote to <HI>Europa,</HI> di&s;&s;uading her from her ridiculous partiality for her favourite bull, when Jupiter in the form of that animal took her off in &s;pite of all <HI>Agenor</HI>'s remon&s;trances, and car|ried her acro&s;s the &s;ea with him upon a tour, that has immortalized her name through the mo&s;t enlightened quarter of the globe: Rhodope is &s;o tenacious of this manu&s;cript, that &s;he rarely in|dulges the curio&s;ity of her friends with a &s;ight of it; &s;he has written an an&s;wer in <HI>Europa</HI>'s be|half after the manner of Ovid's epi&s;tle, in which &s;he makes a very ingenious defence for her he|roine, and every body, who has &s;een the whole of the corre&s;pondence, allows that <HI>Agenor</HI> writes like a man, who knew little of human nature, and that <HI>Rhodope</HI> in her reply has the be&s;t of the argument.</P>

<P>NOTHING now remains for compleat|ing the literary annals of Greece, accord|ing to the plan I have proceeded upon in the foregoing volumes, but to give &s;ome account of the Drama within that period of time, which
<PB N="116" REF="122">
commences with the death of Alexander of Ma|cedon and concludes with that of Menander, or at mo&s;t extends to a very few years beyond it, when the curtain may figuratively be &s;aid to have dropt upon all the glories of the Athenian &s;tage.</P>
<P>This, though the la&s;t, is yet a brilliant aera, for now flouri&s;hed <HI>Menander, Philemon, Diphi|lus, Apollodorus, Philippides, Po&s;idippus</HI>; poets no le&s;s celebrated for the luxuriancy than for the elegance of their genius; all writers of the <HI>New Comedy</HI>; which, if it had not all the wit and fire of the old &s;atirical drama produced in times of greater public freedom, is generally reputed to have been far &s;uperior to it in delicacy, regularity and decorum. All attacks upon living charac|ters cea&s;ed with what is properly denominated the <HI>Old Comedy</HI>; the writers of the <HI>Middle Cla&s;s</HI> contented them&s;elves with venting their raillery upon the works of their dramatic predece&s;&s;ors; the per&s;ons and politics of their contemporaries were &s;afe; whereas neither the highe&s;t &s;tation, nor the brighte&s;t talents were any &s;ure protec|tion from the unre&s;trained invectives of the comic mu&s;e in her earlie&s;t &s;allies.</P>
<P>The poets under our pre&s;ent review were not however &s;o clo&s;ely circum&s;cribed, as to be afraid
<PB N="117" REF="123">
of indulging their talent for ridicule and &s;atire up|on topics of a general nature; without a latitude like this comedy could hardly have exi&s;ted; but this was not all, for among&s;t their fragments &s;ome are to be found, which advance &s;entiments and opinions &s;o directly in the teeth of the popular re|ligion, that we cannot but admire at the extraor|dinary toleration of their pagan audiences. <HI>Ju&s;tin</HI> quotes a pa&s;&s;age from Menander's comedy of <HI>The Charioteer,</HI> in which an old mendicant is introduced carrying about a painted figure of the Great Mother of the Gods, after the manner of the pre&s;ent Popi&s;h Ro&s;aries, and begging a boon as u&s;ual on tho&s;e occa&s;ions; the per&s;on addre&s;&s;ed for his &s;ub&s;cription, contemptuou&s;ly replies&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I have no reli&s;h for &s;uch deities as &s;troll about with an old beggar-woman from door to door, nor for that painted cloth you have the impu|dence to thru&s;t into my pre&s;ence: Let me tell you, woman, if your Mother of the Gods was good for any thing, &s;he would keep to her own &s;tation and take charge of none but tho&s;e, who merit her protection by their piety and devotion."</Q>
This rebuff is of a piece with the &s;urly an&s;wer of the cynic <HI>Anti&s;thenes,</HI> recorded by <HI>Clemens Alexandrinus,</HI> when, being teazed by the&s;e mendicants, the philo&s;opher replied&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Let
<PB N="118" REF="124">
the Gods provide for their own Mother; I am not bound to maintain her."</Q>
In another frag|ment, quoted both by <HI>Clemens</HI> and <HI>Eu&s;ebius,</HI> Menander breaks forth into a bolder rhap&s;ody, which breathes the &s;pirit and nearly the very words of the Hebrew prophets: a per&s;on (in what drama does not appear) addre&s;&s;es his com|panion in the &s;cene to this effect&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"If any man, O Pamphilus, thinks that God will be well plea&s;ed with the &s;acrifice of multitudes of oxen or of goats, or of any other victims; or by robing his images in cloth of gold and purple, and decking them out with ivory and emeralds; that man deceives him&s;elf, and his imaginations are vain; let him rather &s;tudy to conciliate God's favour by doing good to all men; let him ab&s;tain from violation and adultery; let him not commit theft or murder through the lu&s;t of money; nay covet not, O Pamphilus, &s;o much even as the thread of another's needle, for God is ever pre&s;ent and his eye is upon thee."</Q>
This will &s;erve in the place of many more pa&s;&s;ages, which might be adduced, to prove that the comic poets of this period were not only bold declaimers again&s;t the vice and immorality of the age they lived in, but that they ventured upon truths and
<PB N="119" REF="125">
doctrines in religion totally irreconcileable to the popular &s;uper&s;tition and idolatries of the heathen world.</P>
<P>It was on the new comedy of the Greeks that the Roman writers in general founded their's, and this they &s;eem to have accompli&s;hed by the &s;ervile vehicle of tran&s;lation: It is &s;aid that Te|rence alone tran&s;lated all Menander's plays, and the&s;e by the lowe&s;t account amounted to eighty; &s;ome authorities more than double them, an im|probable number to have been compo&s;ed by a poet, who died at the age of fifty, or very little after.</P>

<P><HI>Menander</HI> was born at Athens, the &s;on of <HI>Diopethes</HI> and <HI>Hege&s;i&s;trata:</HI> He was educated in the &s;chool of <HI>Theophra&s;tus</HI> the peripatetic, Ari&s;|totle's &s;ucce&s;&s;or: At the early age of twenty he began to write for the &s;tage, and his pa&s;&s;ions &s;eem to have been no le&s;s forward and impetuous than his genius; his attachment to the fair &s;ex and e&s;pecially to his mi&s;tre&s;s Glycera is upon record, and was vehement in the extreme; &s;eve|ral
<PB N="120" REF="126">
of his epi&s;tles to that celebrated courte&s;an, written in a very ardent &s;tile, were collected and made public after his decea&s;e: The celebrity of his mu&s;e, and the brilliancy of his wit were pro|bably his chief recommendations to that lady's favour; for it &s;hould &s;eem that nature had not been very partial to his external, be&s;ides which he &s;quinted mo&s;t egregiou&s;ly, and was of a tem|per extremely ira&s;cible: If we were to take his character as a writer from no other authorities but of the fragments, we &s;hould form a very dif|ferent idea from that of <HI>Pliny,</HI> who &s;ays he was <HI>omnis luxuriae interpres,</HI> and this even <HI>Plutarch</HI> his avowed panegyri&s;t is candid enough to admit: Ovid al&s;o &s;ays&mdash;<Q><L>The gay Menander charms each youthful heart,</L>
<L>And Love in every fable claims a part.</L></Q></P>
<P>However this may be, the remains, which have come down to us, bear the &s;tamp of an au&s;tere and gloomy mu&s;e rather than of a wan|ton and voluptuous one; but the&s;e it mu&s;t be owned prove little; <HI>Terence</HI> is &s;uppo&s;ed to have copied all his comedies from Menander, except the <HI>Phormio</HI> and the <HI>Hecyra,</HI> and he gives us the be&s;t in&s;ight into the character of his elegant original.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="127">All Greece &s;eems to have joined in lamenting the premature lo&s;s of this celebrated poet, who unfortunately peri&s;hed as he was bathing in the Piraean harbour, to which <HI>Ovid</HI> alludes in his <HI>Ibis</HI>&mdash;<Q>Comicus ut liquidis periit dum nabat in undis.</Q></P>
<P>This happened in Olymp. CXXII; his fir&s;t comedy, intitled <HI>Orge</HI> was performed in Olymp. CXV, which gives him &s;omething le&s;s than thirty years for the production of more than one hundred plays, and if we take the former ac|count of his beginning to write for the &s;tage at the age of twenty, it will agree with what we have before &s;aid re&s;pecting the age at which he died.</P>
<P>Fatal as was the Piraean &s;ea to the per&s;on of this lamented poet, po&s;terity has more cau&s;e to execrate that barbarous gulph, which has &s;wal|lowed up his works; nor his alone, but tho&s;e of above two hundred other eminent dramatic poets, who&s;e labours are totally lo&s;t and extingui&s;hed. We have &s;ome lines of <HI>Callimachus</HI> upon the death of <HI>Menander,</HI> who was one among&s;t many of his poetic &s;urvivors, that paid the tribute of their ingenious &s;orrow to his memory: Nor poets only, but princes bewailed his lo&s;s, particularly <HI>Ptolemy</HI> the &s;on of <HI>Lagus,</HI> who loved and favoured
<PB N="122" REF="128">
him very greatly, and maintained a friendly cor|re&s;pondence with him till his death; &s;ome of Menander's letters to this prince were publi&s;hed with tho&s;e addre&s;&s;ed to his beloved Glycera.</P>
<P>Though many great authorities concur in placing Menander decidedly at the head of all the comic writers of his time, yet his contempo|raries mu&s;t have been of a different opinion, or el&s;e his rivals were more popular with their judges, for out of one hundred and five come|dies, which <HI>Apollodorus</HI> a&s;cribes to him, he tells us that he obtained only eight prizes, and that <HI>Philemon</HI> in particular triumphed over him in the &s;uffrages of the theatre very frequently. If the&s;e deci&s;ions were &s;o glaringly unju&s;t and par|tial as we are taught to believe they were, we have &s;ome &s;ort of apology for the &s;arca&s;tic que&s;|tion put to his &s;ucce&s;sful competitor, when upon meeting him he &s;aid&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Do you not blu&s;h, Phi|lemon, when you prevail over me?"</Q>
This anecdote however at be&s;t only proves that Menander rated his own merits very highly, and that, if they were unju&s;tly treated by tho&s;e, who decided for Philemon, he laid the blame upon the wrong per&s;on, and betrayed a very irritable temper upon the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="129">We have a collection of Menander's frag|ments and the titles of &s;eventy-three comedies; the fragments con&s;i&s;t only of &s;hort &s;entences, and do not give us the &s;pirit and character of the dialogue, much le&s;s of any one entire &s;cene; for though <HI>Hertelius</HI> has gone further than <HI>Grotius</HI> and <HI>Le Clerc</HI> in arranging them under di&s;tinct topics, and has brought into one view every pa&s;&s;age of a corre&s;pondent &s;ort, &s;till it is a mere disjointed medley, intere&s;ting only to the curious, but affording little edification to the generality of readers: Many of them however are to be re&s;pected for their moral &s;entiment, &s;ome are of a very elevated ca&s;t, and others, (more in number than I could wi&s;h) of a gloomy, acrimonious and moro&s;e quality.</P>
<P>Antient authorities are neverthele&s;s &s;o loud in the prai&s;e of Menander, that we cannot doubt of his excellence. <HI>Quintilian</HI> after applauding him for his peculiar addre&s;s in pre&s;erving the man|ners and di&s;tinctions proper to every character he introduces on his &s;cene, adds in general terms,
<Q REND="inline">"that he eclip&s;es every writer of his cla&s;s, and by the &s;uperior brilliancy of his genius throws them all into &s;hade."</Q>&mdash;He condemns the per|verted judgment of his contemporaries for af|fecting
<PB N="124" REF="130">
to prefer Philemon on &s;o many occa|&s;ions; and <HI>C. J. Cae&s;ar,</HI> whil&s;t he is pa&s;&s;ing a compliment upon Terence, &s;tiles him only <HI>dimi|diatum Menandrum. Dion Chry&s;o&s;tom</HI> recom|mends him as a model for all who &s;tudy to excel in oratory,
<Q REND="inline">"and let none of our wi&s;e men re|prehend me,"</Q>
he adds,
<Q REND="inline">"for preferring Me|nander to the old comic poets, ina&s;much as his art in delineating the various manners and graces is more to be e&s;teemed than all the force and vehemence of the antient drama."</Q>
There is &s;o much cla&s;&s;ical elegance in the lines, which <HI>T. Faber</HI> has prefixed to his edition of <HI>Terence,</HI> particularly in the introductory &s;tanza, and this is withal &s;o appo&s;ite to the &s;ubject in hand, that I &s;hall conclude this paper by tran|&s;cribing it.</P>

<P>THE various authors, who have contri|buted to the collection of Menander's re|mains, &s;eem to have extracted from him, as if by general agreement, little el&s;e but the mo&s;t unfa|vourable delineations of the human character: So far from finding tho&s;e facetious and &s;prightly &s;allies to be expected from a comic writer, tho&s;e voluptuous de&s;criptions, which Pliny alludes to, or any fragments of the love &s;cenes Ovid tells us he &s;o abounded in, we meet a melancholy di&s;play of the mi&s;eries, the enormities, the re|pinings of mankind.</P>
<P>What can be more gloomy and mi&s;anthropic than the following &s;train of di&s;content, extracted by Eu&s;tathius!&mdash;
<Q><PB N="126" REF="132">

<P>The reader will ob&s;erve that the&s;e are &s;peci|mens of a general di&s;gu&s;t again&s;t mankind, and of di&s;content with the common lot of human life; as &s;uch they can cla&s;s with the humour of no other character but that of an ab&s;olute mi&s;an|thrope, a kind of <HI>Timon</HI>; for general invective differs widely from that, which is pointed again&s;t any particular vice or folly, and in fact can hardly be con&s;idered as falling within the province of comedy in any ca&s;e.</P>
<P>If Menander hath been ju&s;tly celebrated for his faithful pictures of the living manners of the age he wrote in, we cannot but receive a gloomy impre&s;&s;ion from the dark and di&s;mal tints, in which the&s;e &s;ketches are ca&s;t; and though the age we live in hath follies and failings enough &s;till to feed the comic poet's appetite for &s;atire, we may con&s;ole our&s;elves in the compari&s;on of our own time with his, provided the &s;tage is to
<PB N="128" REF="134">
be regarded as a faithful mirror in both in&s;tances. It is not however improbable but the writers of the <HI>new comedy</HI> might fall with more &s;everity upon general vices to revenge them&s;elves for the re&s;trictions they were &s;ubjected to with re&s;pect to per&s;onalities: Add to this, that as far as the early Chri&s;tian writers were concerned in &s;electing the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, it may well be &s;uppo&s;ed they would naturally take the mo&s;t moral and &s;ententious from among&s;t the comedies they quoted, and &s;uch as afforded grave and u&s;eful remarks upon life, harmonizing with their own doctrines and in|&s;tructions. More e&s;pecially it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed that they would eagerly catch at any of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, which exhibit purer and more worthy notions of the Being and Providence of God, than the vulgar herd of Heathens were known to entertain: Of this ca&s;t is the following contemp|tuous ridicule upon the Pagan ceremony of lu&s;|tration.

I am &s;orry to remark that among&s;t all the frag|ments of this poet not one has been pre&s;erved, that is &s;tampt with even the &s;lighte&s;t commenda|tion of the fair &s;ex: On the contrary I find abun|dance of invective, chiefly again&s;t marriage and married women, often coar&s;e and always bitter: I may venture to &s;ay, if there was a &s;ingle woman in all Athens, who merited one good word, it is one more than the &s;tricte&s;t &s;crutiny can di&s;cover in his remains. Mark how he rails!&mdash;
<Q><L>If &s;uch the &s;ex, was not the &s;entence ju&s;t,</L>
<L>That riveted Prometheus to his rock?&mdash;</L>
<L>&mdash;Why, for what crime?&mdash;A &s;park, a little &s;park;</L>
<L>But, Oh ye Gods! how infinite the mi&s;chief&mdash;</L>
<L>That little &s;park gave being to a woman,</L>
<L>And let in a new race of plagues to cur&s;e us.</L>
<L>Where is the man that weds? &s;hew me the wretch:</L>
<L>Woe to his lot!&mdash;In&s;atiable de&s;ires,</L>
<L>His nuptial bed defil'd, poi&s;onings and plots</L>
<L>And maladies untold&mdash;the&s;e are the fruits</L>
<L>Of marriage, the&s;e the ble&s;&s;ings of a wife.</L></Q>
The poet, who can thus lend his wit to libel the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing of life, may well be ingenious in depreciating life it&s;elf&mdash;
<Q><PB N="130" REF="136">
<L>The lot of all mo&s;t fortunate is his,</L>

<L>Drops without pain into an early grave.</L>
<L>For what is life, the longe&s;t life of man,</L>

<L>In throngs and crowds, with &s;harpers, knaves and thieves;</L>
<L>From &s;uch the &s;peedie&s;t riddance is the be&s;t.</L></Q>
Having given &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages from this poet, where he &s;peaks in the character of a mi&s;anthro|pi&s;t, it is but ju&s;tice to exhibit him as a morali&s;t: If the following fragment &s;ugge&s;ts no new ideas upon the &s;ubject of <HI>Envy,</HI> it will at lea&s;t &s;erve to convince us that mankind in all ages have thought alike upon that de&s;picable pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;<Q><L>Thou &s;eem'&s;t to me, young man, not to perceive</L>

<L>The &s;eeds and &s;ources of its own corruption:</L>

<L>But Envy, of all evil things the wor&s;t,</L>
<L>The &s;ame to-day, to-morrow and for ever,</L>
<L>Saps and con&s;umes the heart, in which it lurks.</L></Q>
<PB N="131" REF="137">
In the fragment next en&s;uing an old man is reproved for the vice of covetou&s;ne&s;s; there is a delicacy in the manner of it, that well becomes both the age and condition of the &s;peaker, for he is a youth, and &s;on to the character, whom he addre&s;&s;es: This fragment is extracted from the comedy intitled <HI>Dy&s;colus (the Churl)</HI> which Plautus is &s;aid to have tran&s;lated and performed under its original title; but of this only a few fragments remain in our volume of that poet; probably the father herein addre&s;&s;ed is the per&s;on who gives name to the comedy&mdash;<Q><L>Weak is the Vanity, that boa&s;ts of riches,</L>
<L>For they are fleeting things; were they not &s;uch,</L>
<L>Could they be your's to all &s;ucceeding time,</L>

There is another fragment of a more comic

We are indebted to Plutarch for a very re&s;pec|table fragment of his favourite poet; he quotes it for the con&s;olatory advice it contains, and addre&s;&s;es it to Apollonius; I give it to my readers as one of the mo&s;t valuable &s;pecimens of its author.
<Q><L>If you, O Trophimus, and you alone</L>

The lines it Italics quoted from <HI>Shak&s;pere's Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> not only corre&s;pond with the exact meaning of the original, but are al&s;o appo&s;ite as a quotation from a tragic poet, Menander him|&s;elf having applied the words of &s;ome one of the writers of tragedy, probably <HI>Euripides.</HI></P>
<P>Among&s;t the &s;maller fragments there are &s;eve|ral good apothegms, &s;ome brief moral maxims well expre&s;&s;ed, and though not many of tho&s;e witty points, which are &s;o frequent in <HI>Ari&s;tophanes,</HI> yet there are &s;ome &s;pecimens of the <HI>Vis comica,</HI> which have a very ingenious turn of words in their own tongue; but generally &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages elude tran&s;lation.&mdash;This quaint confe&s;&s;ion from the mouth of an old mi&s;er is of that &s;ort.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I own I am rich, abominably rich; all the world ac|cu&s;es me of being a very warm old fellow, but

<P>THERE is not among&s;t all the Greek dramatic poets a more amiable character than <HI>Philemon</HI>: He was a Syracu&s;an by <HI>Suidas</HI>'s account, but <HI>Strabo</HI> &s;ays he was born in Solae a city of Cilicia: He was &s;ome years elder than Menander, and no unworthy rival of that poet, though more frequently &s;ucce&s;sful in his compe|titions with him than the critics in general &s;eem to think he de&s;erved to be: Of this we can form little or no judgment; they, who had acce&s;s to the works of both authors, had the be&s;t materials to decide upon. <HI>Apulcius</HI> however &s;peaks rather doubtingly in the compari&s;on, for he &s;ays of Philemon that he was <HI>forta&s;&s;e impar</HI>; to which

&s;ays he, <Q REND="inline">"I con&s;ider the work as fini&s;hed."</Q> The longevity of Philemon was the re&s;ult of great temperance and a placid frame of mind: Frugal to a degree that &s;ubjected him to the charge of avarice, he never weakened his faculties and con&s;titution by exce&s;s, and as he &s;ummed up all his wi&s;hes in one rational and moderate petition to Heaven, which throws a mo&s;t favourable light upon his character, it is with plea&s;ure I record
<PB N="138" REF="144">
it.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I pray for health in the fir&s;t place; in the next for &s;ucce&s;s in my undertakings; thirdly, for a chearful heart, and la&s;tly, to be out of debt to all mankind."</Q>&mdash;This temperate peti|tion &s;eems to have been granted in all particu|lars; he was ble&s;&s;ed with a long and healthful life; he was &s;ucce&s;sful in his undertakings to a degree, which po&s;terity &s;eems to think above his merits, and he triumphed over all his competi|tors more perhaps through the &s;uavity of his manners than from any actual &s;uperiority of his talents: That he was of a gay and happy &s;pirit there is every rea&s;on to believe, and his oecono|my &s;ecured to him that independant competency, which put him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the final object of his wi&s;hes. As he lived in con&s;tant &s;erenity of mind, &s;o he died without pain of body; for hav|ing called together a number of his friends to the reading of a play, which he had newly fini&s;hed, and &s;itting, as was the cu&s;tom in that &s;erene climate, under the open canopy of Hea|ven, an unfore&s;een fall of rain broke up the company ju&s;t when the old man had got into his third act in the very warme&s;t intere&s;ts of his fable: His hearers di&s;appointed by this unlucky check to their entertainment interceded with him for the remainder on the day following, to
<PB N="139" REF="145">
which he readily a&s;&s;ented; and a great company being then a&s;&s;embled, whom the fame of the re|hear&s;al had brought together, they &s;ate a con&s;i|derable time in eager expectation of the poet, till wearied out with waiting, and unable to ac|count for his impunctuality, &s;ome of his inti|mates were di&s;patcht in que&s;t of him, who, having entered his hou&s;e and made their way to his chamber, found the old man dead on his couch, in his u&s;ual meditating po&s;ture, his fea|tures placid and compo&s;ed, and with every &s;ymp|tom, that indicated a death without pain or &s;truggle.</P>
<P>This is <HI>Apuleius</HI>'s account, but <HI>Oelian</HI> embel|li&s;hes the &s;tory with a vi&s;ion, in which he pre|tends that nine fair dam&s;els appeared to Phile|mon, and upon his acco&s;ting them as they were going out of the door, demanding why they would leave him, they told him it was becau&s;e it was not permitted to man to hold conver&s;e with the Immortals: Upon waking from this trance or vi&s;ion, Philemon related it to his page, and then getting up returned to his &s;tudies, and put the la&s;t hand to the comedy he was em|ployed upon: <Q REND="inline">"That done,"</Q> &s;ays <HI>Oelian,</HI>
<Q REND="inline">"he &s;tretched him&s;elf on his couch and quietly expired."</Q>
From this &s;illy anecdote he draws
<PB N="140" REF="146">
an inference, which without his help the world had probaby di&s;covered, viz. <HI>That Philemon truly was in favour with the Mu&s;es.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Valerius Maximus</HI> varies from both the&s;e au|thors in his account of the death of this aged poet; he tells us Philemon was &s;uffocated by a &s;udden fit of laughter upon &s;eeing an a&s;s, who had found his way into the hou&s;e, devour a plate of figs, which his page had provided for him; that he called out to the boy to drive away the a&s;s, but when this order was not executed before the animal had emptied the plate, he bade his page pour out a goblet of wine and pre&s;ent it to the plunderer to compleat his entertainment; tickled with the plea&s;antry of this conceit, and no le&s;s with the grote&s;que attitude and adventure of the animal, Philemon was &s;eized with a fit of laughing and in that fit expired.</P>
<P>The fragments of Philemon are in general of a &s;entimental, tender ca&s;t, and, though they en|force found and &s;trict morality, yet no one in|&s;tance occurs of that gloomy mi&s;anthropy, that har&s;h and dogmatizing &s;pirit, which too often marks the maxims of his more illu&s;trious rival: The following &s;pecimen will illu&s;trate what I a&s;|&s;ert&mdash;It is clear that our poet has <HI>Ae&s;chylus</HI> in his eye.
<Q><PB N="141" REF="147">
<L>All are not Ju&s;t, becau&s;e they do no wrong,</L>
<L>But he, who will not wrong me when he may,</L>
<L>He is the truly Ju&s;t. I prai&s;e not them,</L>

I flatter my&s;elf the reader will be plea&s;ed with the following animated apo&s;trophe, which is a fragment of the <HI>Ignifer</HI>&mdash;<Q><L>Now by the Gods, it is not in the power</L>

<P>THE poet <HI>Diphilus</HI> was a native of Sinope, a city of Pontus, and contemporary with Menander. <HI>Clemens Alexandrinus</HI> applauds him for his comic wit and humour; <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> &s;ays the &s;ame and adds a further encomium in re&s;pect of the &s;ententious and moral character of his drama. The poet <HI>Plautus</HI> &s;peaks of him in his prologue to the <HI>Ca&s;ina,</HI> and acknowledges the excellence of the original upon which he had formed his comedy. He died at Smyrna, a city of Ionia, and was author of one hundred come|dies, of which we have a li&s;t of two and thirty titles, and no incon&s;iderable collection of frag|ments; out of the&s;e I have &s;elected the following example&mdash;<Q><L>We have a notable good law at Corinth,</L>

<HI>Apollodorus Gelous</HI> in the &s;ame period with the poets abovementioned was a writer high in fame, and author of many comedies, of all which the titles of eight only and &s;ome few frag|ments now remain: It is generally under&s;tood that the <HI>Phormio</HI> and <HI>Hecyra</HI> of <HI>Terence</HI> are copied from this poet.

<HI>Philippidas,</HI> the &s;on of <HI>Philocles,</HI> was another of this illu&s;trious band of contemporary and rival authors: His extreme &s;en&s;ibility was the cau&s;e of his death, for the &s;udden tran&s;port, occa&s;ioned by the unexpected &s;ucce&s;s of one of his comedies, put a period to his life; the poet however was at this time very aged. Donatus informs us that Philippidas was in the highe&s;t favour with <HI>Ly&s;imachus,</HI> to whom he recommended him&s;elf not by the common modes of flattery, but by his amiable and virtuous qualities; the intere&s;t he had with Ly&s;imachus he ever employed to the mo&s;t honourable purpo&s;es, and thereby di&s;|po&s;ed him to confer many great and u&s;eful fa|vours upon the people of Athens: So highly did his princely patron e&s;teem this venerable man, that whenever he &s;et out upon any expedition, and chanced upon Philippidas is his way, he ac|counted

<P><HI>Po&s;idippus,</HI> with whom I &s;hall conclude, was a Macedonian, born at Ca&s;&s;andria and the &s;on of <HI>Cyni&s;cus.</HI> Abundant te&s;timonies are to be found in the old grammarians of the celebrity of this poet; few fragments of his comedies have de&s;|cended to us, and the titles only of twelve. He may be reckoned the la&s;t of the comic poets, as it was not till three years after the death of Menander that he began to write for the Athe|nian &s;tage, and po&s;terior to him I know of no author, who has bequeathed even his name to po&s;terity: Here then concludes the hi&s;tory of the Greek &s;tage; below this period it is in vain to &s;earch for genius worth recording; Grecian literature and Grecian liberty expired together; a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;ophi&s;ts, paedagogues and gram|marians filled the po&s;ts of tho&s;e illu&s;trious wits, who&s;e &s;pirit, fo&s;tered by freedom, &s;oared to &s;uch heights as left the Roman poets little el&s;e except the &s;econdary fame of imitation.</P>
<P>I have now fulfilled what I may be allowed to

call my literary engagements; in the cour&s;e of which I have expended no &s;mall pains and atten|tion in dragging from ob&s;curity relicks buried in the rubbi&s;h of the darker ages, when the whole world &s;eemed to con&s;pire again&s;t Genius; when learning had degenerated into &s;ophi&s;m, and religion was made a theme of metaphy&s;ical &s;ubtelty, &s;erving, as it &s;hould &s;eem, no other pur|po&s;e but to puzzle and confound, to inflame the pa&s;&s;ions and to perplex the head. Then it was, the fathers of the church, in who&s;e hands the&s;e authors were, held it a point of con&s;cience to de&s;troy the idols of the &s;tage, as they had already de&s;troyed the idols of the temple, and to bury heathen wit in the &s;ame grave with heathen &s;uper|&s;tition; their poets and their gods were to be exterminated alike. To the more enlightened ta&s;te, or rather perhaps to the lucky partiality, of <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tom</HI> alone we owe the pre&s;ervation of <HI>Ari&s;tophanes.</HI> Continually engaged in argumen|tative and controver&s;ial writings there were &s;ome, who occa&s;ionally conde&s;cended to quote a pa&s;&s;age, as it &s;erved their purpo&s;e, from the&s;e pro&s;cribed comedies, either to help out their wits or illu&s;trate their meaning; and the&s;e &s;craps and &s;plinters being &s;wept together by &s;ome few patient collectors, who had charity enough

This part of my general undertaking being heavier than all the re&s;t to my&s;elf, I was much afraid it would have proved &s;o to my readers al&s;o; but their candid recep|tion of the&s;e papers in particular, and the encou|raging voice of my profe&s;t reviewers, have ba|ni&s;hed that anxiety from my mind, and enabled me to proceed with chearfulne&s;s to the end.</P>
<P>There is one part however of the&s;e papers, in which I conceive I have been mi&s;under&s;tood as having carried my attack again&s;t the moral doc|trines of Socrates, and of this I am intere&s;ted to exculpate my&s;elf; My &s;ubject led me to refer to certain anecdotes unfavourable to his private character, but I &s;tudiou&s;ly marked tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages by ob&s;erving that there was no de&s;ign to glance

at his moral doctrines, and at the &s;ame time quoted the authorities upon which tho&s;e anec|dotes re&s;t; when any &s;cholar will convince me the&s;e were futile and malicious tales, I will re|tract all credit in them and thank him for the conviction: As for the purity of Socrates's doc|trine I never attempted to impeach it; of the purity of his character I mu&s;t continue to think there is much cau&s;e to doubt. The learned <HI>Bi&s;hop Sherlock</HI> in his fourth di&s;cour&s;e may be referred to upon this &s;ubject: He there &s;ays <HI>that the corrupt example of Socrates was a dead weight upon the purity of his doctrine, and tended to per|petuate &s;uper&s;tition in the world</HI>&mdash;Though I am aware that the <HI>corrupt example</HI> here alluded to re&s;pects his religious practice, yet &s;urely if the preacher of Chri&s;tianity was intere&s;ted to &s;hew the <HI>corrupt example</HI> of <HI>Socrates</HI> in this light, the friend of Chri&s;tianity may be allowed to repre|&s;ent it in another point of view, and by fair au|thorities to exhibit what the heathens them&s;elves have reported of this famous philo&s;opher, who&s;e moral purity is by &s;ome taken merely upon tru&s;t, by others de&s;ignedly extolled to the &s;kies for the &s;ake of oppo&s;ing character to character, and by an audacious compari&s;on with Chri&s;t di&s;paraging the Divinity of the World's Redeemer. I &s;hould

<P>NICOLAS Pedro&s;a, a bu&s;y little being, who followed the trades of &s;haver, &s;ur|geon and man-midwife in the town of Madrid, mounted his mule at the door of his &s;hop in the
<PB N="182" REF="188">
Plazuela de los Affligidos, and pu&s;hed through the gate of San Bernardino, being called to a pa|tient in the neighbouring village of Foncarral, upon a pre&s;&s;ing occa&s;ion. Every body knows that the ladies in Spain in certain ca&s;es do not give long warning to practitioners of a certain de&s;cription, and no body knew it better than Nicolas, who was re&s;olved not to lo&s;e an inch of his way, nor of his mule's be&s;t &s;peed by the way, if cudgelling could beat it out of her. It was plain to Nicolas's conviction as plain could be, that his road laid &s;trait forward to the little con|vent in front; the mule was of opinion, that the turning on the left down the hill towards the Prado was the road of all roads mo&s;t familiar and agree|able to her&s;elf, and accordingly began to di&s;pute the point of topography with Nicolas by fixing her fore feet re&s;olutely in the ground, dipping her head at the &s;ame time between them, and launching heels and crupper furiou&s;ly into the air, in the way of argument. Little Pedro&s;a, who was armed at heel with one ma&s;&s;y &s;ilver &s;pur of &s;tout, though antient, workman&s;hip, re|&s;olutely applied the ru&s;ty rowel to the &s;houlder of his bea&s;t, driving it with all the good will in the world to the very butt, and at the &s;ame time, adroitly tucking his blue cloth capa under his

right arm, and flinging the &s;kirt over the left &s;houlder <HI>en cavalier,</HI> began to lay about him with a &s;tout a&s;hen &s;apling upon the ears, pole and cheeks of the recreant mule. The fire now fla&s;hed from a pair of Andalu&s;ian eyes, as black as charcoal and not le&s;s inflammable, and taking the &s;egara from his mouth, with which he had vainly hoped to have regaled his no&s;trils in a &s;harp winter's evening by the way, rai&s;ed &s;uch a thundering troop of angels, &s;aints and martyrs, from St. Michael downwards, not forgetting his own name&s;ake Saint Nicolas de Tolentino by the way, that if cur&s;es could have made the mule to go, the di&s;pute would have been &s;oon ended, but not a &s;aint could make her &s;tir any other ways than upwards and downwards at a &s;tand.

<Q REND="inline">"Ah father,"</Q> replied Pe|dro&s;a,
<Q REND="inline">"Balaam cudgelled his bea&s;t till &s;he &s;poke, &s;o will I mine till &s;he roars."&mdash;</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"Fie, fie, pro|phane fellow,"</Q>
cries another of the fraternity. <Q REND="inline">"Go about your work, friend,"</Q> quoth Nicolas,
<Q REND="inline">"and let me go about mine; I warrant it is the more pre&s;&s;ing of the two; your patient is

<Q REND="inline">"Hear him,"</Q> cries a third,
<Q REND="inline">"hear the vile wretch, how he bla&s;phemes the body of God."</Q>&mdash;And then the troop pa&s;&s;ed &s;lowly on to the tinkling of the bell.</P>
<P>A man mu&s;t know nothing of a mule's ears, who does not know what a pa&s;&s;ion they have for the tinkling of a bell, and no &s;ooner had the jing|ling chords vibrated in the &s;ympathetic organs of Pedro&s;a's bea&s;t, than boulting forward with a &s;udden &s;pring &s;he ran roaring into the throng of friars, trampling on &s;ome and &s;houldering others at a mo&s;t profane rate; when Nicolas availing him&s;elf of the impetus, and perhaps not able to controul it, broke away and was out of &s;ight in a moment.
<Q REND="inline">"All the devils in hell blow fire into thy tail, thou bea&s;t of Baby|lon,"</Q>
muttered Nicolas to him&s;elf, as he &s;campered along, never once looking behind him or &s;topping to apologize for the mi&s;chief he had done to the bare feet and &s;hirtle&s;s ribs of the holy brotherhood.</P>
<P>Whether Nicolas &s;aved his di&s;tance, as like|wi&s;e, if he did, whether it was a male or female Ca&s;tilian he u&s;hered into the world, we &s;hall not ju&s;t now enquire, contented to await his return in the fir&s;t of the morning next day, when he had no

&s;ooner di&s;mounted at his &s;hop and delivered his mule to a &s;turdy Arragone&s;e wench, when Don Ignacio de Santos Aparicio, alguazil mayor of the &s;upreme and general inqui&s;ition, put an order into his hand, &s;igned and &s;ealed by the inqui&s;idor general, for the conveyance of his body to the Ca&s;a, who&s;e formidable door pre&s;ents it&s;elf in the &s;treet adjoining to the &s;quare, in which Nicolas's brazen ba&s;in hung forth the emblem of his trade.</P>
<P>The poor little fellow, trembling in every joint and with a face as yellow as &s;affron, dropt a knee to the altar, which fronts the entrance, and cro&s;&s;ed him&s;elf mo&s;t devoutly; as &s;oon as he had a&s;cended the fir&s;t flight of &s;tairs, a porter habited in black opened the tremendous barricade and Nicolas with horror heard the grating of the heavy bolts that &s;hut him in. He was led through pa&s;&s;ages and vaults and melancholy cells, till he was delivered into the dungeon, where he was finally left to his &s;olitary meditations. Hap|le&s;s being! what a &s;cene of horror.&mdash;Nicolas felt all the terrors of his condition, but being an An|dalu&s;ian and like his countrymen of a lively ima|gination, he began to turn over all the re&s;ources of his invention for &s;ome happy fetch, if any &s;uch might occur, for helping him out of the di&s;mal

limbo he was in: He was not long to &s;eek for the cau&s;e of his misfortune; his adventure with the barefooted friars was a ready &s;olution of all difficulties of that nature, had there been any: There was however another thing, which might have troubled a &s;touter heart than Nicolas's&mdash;He was a Jew.&mdash;This of a certain would have been a &s;taggering item in a poor devil's confe&s;&s;ion, but then it was a &s;ecret to all the world but Ni|colas, and Nicolas's con&s;cience did not ju&s;t then urge him to reveal it: He now began to over|haul the inventory of his per&s;onals about him, and with &s;ome &s;atisfaction counted three little medals of the ble&s;&s;ed virgin, two Agnus Deis, a Saint Nicolas de Tolentino and a formidable &s;tring of beads all pendant from his neck and within his &s;hirt; in his pockets he had had a paper of dried figs, a &s;mall bundle of &s;egaras, a ca&s;e of lancets, &s;quirt and forceps, and two old razors in a leathern envelope; the&s;e he had delivered one by one to the alguazil, who fir&s;t arre&s;ted him,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"and let him make the mo&s;t of them,"</Q> &s;aid he to him&s;elf,

And now the cell door opened, when a &s;avage figure entered carry|ing a huge parcel of clanking fetters, with a collar of iron, which he put round the neck of poor Pedro&s;a, telling him with a truly diabolic grin, whil&s;t he was rivetting it on, that it was a proper cravat for the throat of a bla&s;phemer.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Je&s;u-Maria,"</Q> quoth Pedro&s;a,
<Q REND="inline">"is all this fallen upon me for only cudgelling a re&s;tive mule?"</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"Aye,"</Q> cried the demon,
<Q REND="inline">"and this is only a ta&s;te of what is to come,"</Q>
at the &s;ame time &s;lipping his pincers from the &s;crew he was forcing to the head, he caught a piece of fle&s;h in the forceps and wrenched it out of his cheek, laughing at poor Nicolas, whil&s;t he roared aloud with the pain, telling him it was a ju&s;t reward for the torture he had put him to awhile ago, when he tugged at a tooth, till he broke it in his jaw. <Q REND="inline">"Ah, for the love of Heaven,"</Q> cried Pe|dro&s;a,

One of the me&s;&s;engers of the auditory now came in, and

bade the fellow &s;trike off the pri&s;oner's fetters, for that the holy fathers were in council and demanded him for examination.

<Q REND="inline">"I &s;hould not have expected it this twelvemonth to come."</Q>
Pedro&s;a's fetters were &s;truck off; &s;ome brandy was applied to &s;taunch the bleeding of his cheeks; his hands and face were wa&s;hed, and a &s;hort jacket of coar&s;e ticking thrown over him, and the me&s;&s;enger with an a&s;&s;i&s;tant taking him each under an arm led him into a &s;pacious chamber, where at the head of a long table &s;ate his excellency the inqui&s;idor general with &s;ix of his a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, three on each &s;ide the chair of &s;tate: The alguazil mayor, a &s;ecretary and two notaries with other officers of the holy council were attending in their places.</P>
<P>The pri&s;oner was placed behind a bar at the foot of the table between the me&s;&s;engers, who brought him in, and having made his obei&s;ance to the awful pre&s;ence in the mo&s;t &s;upplicating manner, he was called upon according to the u&s;ual form of que&s;tions by one of the junior judges to declare his name, parentage, profe&s;&s;ion, age, place of abode, and to an&s;wer various in|terrogatories of the like trifling nature: His excellency the inqui&s;idor general now opened

<P>AS &s;oon as the room was cleared the inqui&s;i|dor general beckoning to the pri&s;oner to follow him, retired into a private clo&s;et, where throwing him&s;elf carele&s;sly into an arm chair, he turned a gracious countenance upon the poor affrighted accoucheur, and bidding him &s;it down
<PB N="194" REF="200">
upon a low &s;tool by his &s;ide, thus acco&s;ted him:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Take heart, &s;enor Pedro&s;a, your impri&s;onment is not likely to be very tedious, for I have a commi&s;&s;ion you mu&s;t execute without lo&s;s of time: you have too much con&s;ideration for your&s;elf to betray a tru&s;t, the violation of which mu&s;t involve you in inevitable ruin, and can in no degree attaint my character, which is far enough beyond the reach of ma|lice: Be attentive therefore to my orders; execute them punctually and keep my &s;ecret as you tender your own life: Do&s;t thou know the name and condition of the lady, whom thou ha&s;t delivered?"</Q>

<Q REND="inline">"Thou talke&s;t like a fool, friend Nicolas,"</Q>
interrupting him, &s;aid the inqui&s;idor;
<Q REND="inline">"What telle&s;t thou me of thy &s;wathings and &s;wadlings? quick work mu&s;t be wrought by quick medicines: Ha&s;t thou none &s;uch in thy botica?

<Q REND="inline">"Humph!"</Q> quoth Nicolas within him&s;elf,
<Q REND="inline">"Well &s;aid, inqui&s;idor!"</Q>
He took the vial with all po&s;&s;ible re&s;pect, and was not wanting in profe&s;&s;ions of the mo&s;t inviolable fidelity and &s;ecrecy&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"No

quoth the in|qui&s;idor,
<Q REND="inline">"upon that &s;core; I do not believe thee one jot the more for all thy promi&s;es, my dependance is upon thy fears and not thy faith; I fancy thou ha&s;t &s;een enough of this place not to be willing to return to it once for all."</Q>&mdash;Having &s;o &s;aid, he rang a bell, and ordered Nicolas to be forthwith liberated, bid|ding the me&s;&s;enger return his clothes in&s;tantly to him with all that belonged to him, and hav|ing &s;lipt a pur&s;e into his hand well filled with doubloons, he bade him be gone about his bu&s;i|ne&s;s and not &s;ee his face again till he had exe|cuted his commands.</P>
<P>Nicolas boulted out of the porch without taking leave of the altar, and never checked his &s;peed till he found him&s;elf fairly hou&s;ed under &s;helter of his own beloved bra&s;s ba&s;in.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Aha!"</Q> quoth Nicolas,
<Q REND="inline">"my lord inqui&s;idor, I &s;ee the king is not likely to gain a &s;ubject more by your intrigues: A pretty job you have &s;et me about; and &s;o, when I have put the poor lady to re&s;t with your damned &s;edative, my tongue mu&s;t be &s;topt next to prevent its blabbing: But I'll &s;hew you I was not born in Andalu&s;ia for nothing."</Q>
Nicolas now opened a &s;ecret drawer and took out a few pieces
<PB N="197" REF="203">
of money, which in fact was his whole &s;tock of ca&s;h in the world; he loaded and primed his pi&s;tols and carefully lodged them in the hou&s;ers of his &s;addle, he buckled to his &s;ide his tru&s;ty &s;pada, and ha&s;tened to capari&s;on his mule. <Q REND="inline">"Ah, thou imp of the old one,"</Q> quoth he as he entered the &s;table,
<Q REND="inline">"art not a&s;hamed to look me in the face? But come, hu&s;&s;ey, thou owe&s;t me a good turn methinks, &s;tand by me this once, and be friends for ever! thou art in good ca&s;e, and if thou wilt put thy be&s;t foot foremo&s;t, like a faithful bea&s;t, thou &s;halt not want for barley by the way."</Q>
The bargain was &s;oon &s;truck between Nicolas and his mule, he mounted her in the happy moment and point|ing his cour&s;e towards the bridge of Toledo, which proudly &s;trides with half a dozen lofty arches over a &s;tream &s;carce three feet wide, he found him&s;elf as completely in a de&s;art in half a mile's riding, as if he had been dropt in the center of Arabia petraea. As Nicolas's journey was not a tour of curio&s;ity, he did not amu&s;e him&s;elf with a peep at Toledo, or Talavera, or even Merida by the way; for the &s;ame rea&s;on he took a <HI>circumbendibus</HI> round the frontier town of Badajoz, and cro&s;&s;ing a little brook refre&s;hed his mule with the la&s;t draught of Spani&s;h water, and
<PB N="198" REF="204">
in&s;tantly congratulated him&s;elf upon entering the territory of Portugal. <Q REND="inline">"Brava!"</Q> quoth he, patting the neck of his mule,
<Q REND="inline">"thou &s;halt have a &s;upper this night of the be&s;t &s;ieve-meat that E&s;tremadura can furni&s;h: We are now in a country where the &s;cattered flock of I&s;rael fold thick and fare well."</Q>
He now began to chaunt the &s;ong of Solomon, and gently ambled on in the joy of his heart.</P>
<P>When Nicolas at length reached the city of Li&s;bon, he hugged him&s;elf in his good fortune; &s;till he recollected that the inqui&s;ition has long arms, and he was yet in a place of no perfect &s;ecurity. Our adventurer had in early life acted as a&s;&s;i&s;tant &s;urgeon in a Spani&s;h frigate bound to Buenos Ayres, and being captured by a Briti&s;h man of war and carried into Jamaica, had very quietly pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome years in that place as jour|neyman apothecary, in which time he had ac|quired a tolerable acquaintance with the Engli&s;h language: No &s;ooner then did he di&s;cover the Briti&s;h en&s;ign flying on the poop of an Engli&s;h frigate then lying in the Tagus, than he eagerly caught the opportunity of paying a vi&s;it to the &s;urgeon, and finding he was in want of a mate, offered him&s;elf and was entered in that capacity for a cruize again&s;t the French and Spaniards,
<PB N="199" REF="205">
with whom Great Britain was then at war. In this &s;ecure a&s;ylum Nicolas enjoyed the fir&s;t happy moments he had experienced for a long time pa&s;t, and being a lively good-humoured little fellow, and one that touched the guitar and &s;ung &s;equidillas with a tolerable grace, he &s;oon re|commended him&s;elf to his &s;hip-mates and grew in favour with every body on board from the cap|tain to the cook's mate.</P>
<P>When they were out upon their cruize hover|ing on the Spani&s;h coa&s;t, it occurred to Nicolas that the inqui&s;idor general at Madrid had told him of the expected arrival of the pre&s;ident of Quito, and having imparted this to one of the lieutenants, he reported it to the captain, and, as the intelligence &s;eemed of importance, he availed him&s;elf of it by hawling into the track of the homeward-bound galleons, and great was the joy, when at the break of the morning the man at the ma&s;t-head announced a &s;quare-rigged ve&s;&s;el in view: The ardor of a chace now &s;et all hands at work, and a few hours brought them near enough to di&s;cern that &s;he was a Spani&s;h frigate and &s;eemingly from a long voyage: Little Pedro&s;a, as alert as the re&s;t, &s;tript him&s;elf for his work and repaired to his po&s;t in the cock-pit, whil&s;t the thunder of the guns rolled ince&s;&s;antly
<PB N="200" REF="206">
overhead; three cheers from the whole crew at length announced the moment of victory, and a few more minutes a&s;certained the good news that the prize was a frigate richly laden from the South Seas with the governor of Quito and his &s;uite on board.</P>
<P>Pedro&s;a was now called upon deck and &s;ent on board the prize as interpreter to the fir&s;t lieutenant, who was to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her. He found every thing in confu&s;ion, a deck covered with the &s;lain and the whole crew in con&s;ternation at an event they were in no de|gree prepared for, not having received any inti|mation of a war. He found the officers in general and the pa&s;&s;engers without exception under the mo&s;t horrid impre&s;&s;ions of the Engli&s;h, and expecting to be plundered and perhaps but|chered without mercy. Don Manuel de Ca&s;a|fonda the governor, who&s;e countenance be&s;poke a con&s;titution far gone in a decline, had thrown him&s;elf on a &s;opha in the la&s;t &s;tate of de&s;pair and given way to an effu&s;ion of tears; when the lieutenant entered the cabin he ro&s;e trembling from his couch and with the mo&s;t &s;upplicating action pre&s;ented to him his &s;word, and with it a ca&s;ket which he carried in his other hand; as he tendered the&s;e &s;poils to his conqueror, whether

<Q REND="inline">"So far I will open my&s;elf to you,"</Q>

<Q REND="inline">"Well, Sir,"</Q> replied the captain,
<Q REND="inline">"if my advice does not meet belief, I mu&s;t &s;o far exert my authority for your &s;ake, as to make this &s;hip your pri|&s;on, till I have waited on our mini&s;ter at Li&s;bon and made the enquiries nece&s;&s;ary for your &s;afety; &s;u&s;pend your judgment upon the &s;eeming har&s;hne&s;s of this mea&s;ure till I return to you again;"</Q>
and at the &s;ame time ri&s;ing from his &s;eat, he gave orders for the barge, and leaving &s;trict injunctions with the fir&s;t lieute|nant not to allow of the governor's quitting the frigate, he put off for the &s;hore and left the me|lancholy Spaniard buried in profound and &s;ilent meditation.</P>

<PB N="210" REF="216">
Pedro&s;a had delivered to him, and with his con|currence it was determined to forward letters into Spain, which Don Manuel &s;hould be ad|vi&s;ed to write to his lady and friends at Madrid, and to wait their an&s;wer before any further di&s;|coveries were imparted to him re&s;pecting the blacker circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e: In the mean time it was re&s;olved to keep the pri&s;oner &s;afe in his a&s;ylum.</P>
<P>The generous Captain lo&s;t no time in return|ing to his frigate, where he immediately im|parted to Don Manuel the intelligence he had obtained at the Briti&s;h Mini&s;ter's&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"This in|deed,"</Q>
cried the afflicted Spaniard,

<Q REND="inline">"As I know him not,"</Q> replied the Captain,

of his motives; but this I know, that if a man's heart is capable of cruelty, the fitte&s;t &s;chool to learn it in, mu&s;t be the Inqui&s;ition."</Q>
The propo&s;al was now &s;ugge&s;ted of &s;ending let|ters into Spain, and the Governor retired to his de&s;k for the purpo&s;e of writing them; in the af|ternoon of the &s;ame day the Mini&s;ter paid a vi&s;it to the Captain, and receiving a packet from the hands of Don Manuel, promi&s;ed to get it for|warded by a &s;afe conveyance according to di|rection.</P>
<P>In due cour&s;e of time this fatal letter from Leonora opened all the horrible tran&s;action to the wretched hu&s;band:&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>The guilty hand of an expiring wife, under the ago|nizing operation of a mortal poi&s;on, traces the&s;e few trembling lines to an injured wretched hu&s;band.

<P><PB N="212" REF="218">Had a &s;hot pa&s;&s;ed through the heart of Don Manuel, it could not more effectually have &s;topt its motions, than the peru&s;al of this fatal writing: He dropped lifele&s;s on the couch, and but for the care and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Captain and Pedro&s;a in that po&s;ture he had probably expired.

<P>Let us drop the curtain over this melancholy pau&s;e in our narration, and attend upon the mournful widower now landing upon Engli&s;h ground, and conveyed by his humane and gene|rous pre&s;erver to the hou&s;e of a noble Earl, the father of our amiable Captain and a man by his virtues &s;till more con&s;picuous than by his rank. Here amid&s;t the gentle &s;olicitudes of a benevo|lent family, in one of the mo&s;t enchanting &s;pots on earth, in a climate mo&s;t &s;alubrious and re&s;to|rative to a con&s;titution exhau&s;ted by heat and a heart near broken with &s;orrow, the reviving &s;pirits of the unfortunate Don Manuel gave the fir&s;t &s;ymptoms of a po&s;&s;ible recovery. At the period of a few tranquillizing weeks here pa&s;&s;ed in the bo&s;om of humanity, letters came to hand from the Briti&s;h Mini&s;ter at Li&s;bon, in an&s;wer to a memorial, that I &s;hould have &s;tated to have
<PB N="213" REF="219">
been drawn up by the friendly Captain before his departure from that port, with a detail of facts depo&s;ed and &s;worn to by Nicolas Pedro&s;a, which memorial with the documents attached to it was forwarded to the Spani&s;h Court by &s;pecial expre&s;s from the Portugue&s;e premier. By the&s;e letters it appeared that the high dignity of the per&s;on impeached by this &s;tatement of facts had not been &s;ufficient to &s;creen him from a very &s;e|rious and complete inve&s;tigation; in the cour&s;e of which facts had been &s;o clearly brought home to him by the confe&s;&s;ion of his &s;everal agents, and the te&s;timony of the decea&s;ed Leonora's attendants together with her own written decla|rations, whil&s;t the poi&s;on was in operation, that though no public &s;entence had been executed upon the criminal, it was generally under&s;tood he was either no longer in exi&s;tence, or in a &s;itu|ation never to be heard of any more, till rou&s;ed by the awakening trump he &s;hall be &s;ummoned to his tremendous la&s;t account. As for the un|happy widower it was fully &s;ignified to him from authority, that his return to Spain, whether upon exchange or parole, would be no longer oppo&s;ed, nor had he any thing to apprehend on the part of government, when he &s;hould there arrive. The

<P>Whether Don Manuel de Ca&s;afonda will in time to come avail him&s;elf of the&s;e overtures time alone can prove: As for little Nicolas, who&s;e prize money has &s;et him up in a comfort|able little &s;hop in Duke's place, where he breathes the veins and clean&s;es the bowels of his I&s;raeliti&s;h brethren in a land of freedom and to|leration, his merry heart is at re&s;t, &s;ave only when with fire in his eyes and vengeance on his tongue he anathematizes the Inqui&s;ition, and &s;truts into the &s;ynagogue every &s;abbath with as bold a &s;tep and as erect a look, as if he was him&s;elf High Prie&s;t of the Temple going to perform &s;acrifice upon the re-a&s;&s;embling of the &s;cattered tribes.</P>

countries, where men mu&s;t lock the doors again&s;t &s;pies and informers, and mu&s;t entru&s;t their lives, whil&s;t they impart their &s;entiments, to each other. In &s;uch circum&s;tances a mind, enlightened by education is no longer a ble&s;&s;ing: What is the advantage of di&s;cernment, and how is a man profited by his capacity of &s;eparating truth from error, if he dare not exerci&s;e that faculty? It were &s;afer to be the blind dupe of &s;uper&s;tition than the intuitive philo&s;opher, if born within the juri&s;diction of an inqui&s;itorial tribunal. Can a man felicitate him&s;elf in the glow of ge|nius and the gayety of wit, when breathing the air of a country, where &s;o dire an in&s;trument is in force as a <HI>lettre de cachet?</HI> But experience hath &s;hewn us, that if arbitrary monarchs cannot keep their people in ignorance, they cannot re|tain them in &s;lavery; if men read, they will me|ditate; if they travel, they will compare, and their minds mu&s;t be as dark as the dungeons, which impri&s;on their per&s;ons, if they do not ri&s;e with indignation again&s;t &s;uch mon&s;trous maxims, as impri&s;onment at plea&s;ure for undefined of|fences, &s;elf-accu&s;ations extorted by torments and &s;ecret trials, where the pri&s;oner hath neither voice nor advocate.

<HI>their pavilion,</HI> and draw their very mountains down upon them to &s;hut out the light, or expect the period of their de&s;poti&s;m: Illuminated minds will not be kept in &s;lavery.</P>
<P>With a nation &s;o free, &s;o highly enlightened and &s;o eminent in letters as the Engli&s;h, we may well expect to find the &s;ocial qualities in their be&s;t &s;tate; and it is but ju&s;tice to the age we live in to confe&s;s tho&s;e expectations may be fully gratified: There are &s;ome perhaps who will not &s;ub&s;cribe to this a&s;&s;ertion, but probably tho&s;e very people make the di&s;appointments they com|plain of: If a man takes no pains to plea&s;e his company, he is little likely to be plea&s;ed by his company. Liberty, though e&s;&s;ential to good &s;o|ciety, may in &s;ome of it's effects operate again&s;t it, for as it makes men independant, indepen|dance will occa&s;ionally be found to make them arrogant, and none &s;uch can be good compa|nions; yet let me &s;ay for the contemporaries I am living with, that within the period of my own acquaintance with the world the reform in it's &s;ocial manners and habits has been gradual and encrea&s;ing. The feudal haughtine&s;s of our no|bility has totally di&s;appeared, and, in place of a proud di&s;tant re&s;erve, a plea&s;ing &s;uavity and com|panionable ea&s;e have almo&s;t univer&s;ally obtained

among&s;t the higher orders: The pedantry of office is gone, and even the animo&s;ity of party is &s;o far in the wain, that it &s;erves rather to whet our wits than our &s;words again&s;t each other: The agitation of political opinions is no longer a &s;ubject fatal to the peace of the table, but takes it's turn with other topics without any breach of good-manners or good fellow&s;hip.</P>
<P>It were too much to &s;ay that there are no ge|neral cau&s;es &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, which annoy our &s;o|cial comforts, and di&s;grace our tempers; they are &s;till too many, and it is among&s;t the duties of an <HI>Ob&s;erver</HI> to &s;et a mark upon them, though by &s;o doing I may run into repetition, for I am not con&s;cious of having any thing to &s;ay upon the &s;ubject, which I have not &s;aid before; but if a beggar, who a&s;ks charity, becau&s;e of his impor|tunity &s;hall at length be relieved, an author per|haps, who enforces his advice, &s;hall in the end be li&s;tened to.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t therefore again and again in&s;i&s;t upon it, that there are two &s;ides to every argument, and that it is the natural and unalienable right of man to be heard in &s;upport of his opinion, he having fir&s;t lent a patient ear to the &s;peaker, who main|tains &s;entiments, which oppo&s;e that opinion: I do humbly apprehend that an overbearing voice

and noi&s;y volubility of tongue are proofs of a very underbred fellow, and it is with regret I &s;ee &s;ociety too frequently di&s;turbed in it's mo&s;t de|lectable enjoyments by this odious character: I do not &s;ee that any man hath a right by obliga|tion or otherwi&s;e to lay me under a nece&s;&s;ity of thinking exactly as he thinks: Though I admit that <HI>from the fullne&s;s of the heart the tongue &s;peaketh,</HI> I do not admit any &s;uperior preten&s;ions it hath to be <HI>Sir Oracle</HI> from the fullne&s;s of the pocket. In the name of freedom what claim hath any man to be the tyrant of the table? As well he may avail him&s;elf of the greater force of his fi&s;ts as of his lungs. Doth &s;en&s;e con&s;i&s;t in &s;ound, or is truth only to be mea&s;ured by the noi&s;e it makes? Can it be a di&s;grace to be con|vinced, or doth any one lo&s;e by the exchange, who re&s;igns his own opinion for a better? When I reflect upon the advantages of our public &s;chools, where puerile tempers are cor|rected by colli&s;ion; upon the mathematical &s;tu|dies and &s;chola&s;tic exerci&s;es of our univer&s;ities, I am no le&s;s grieved than a&s;toni&s;hed to di&s;cover &s;o few proficients in well-mannered controver&s;y, &s;o very few, who &s;eem to make truth the object of their inve&s;tigation, or will &s;pare a few patient moments from the eternal repetition of their

own deafening jargon to the temperate reply of men, probably better qualified to &s;peak than them&s;elves.</P>
<P>There is another grievance not unfrequent though inferior to this abovementioned, which proceeds jointly from the mixt nature of &s;ociety and the ebullitions of freedom in this happy country, I mean that roar of mirth and uncon|trouled flow of &s;pirits, which hath more vulga|rity in it than ea&s;e, more noi&s;e than gayety: The &s;tream of elegant fe&s;tivity will never overflow it's banks; the delicacy of &s;ex, the dignity of rank and the decorum of certain profe&s;&s;ions &s;hould never be &s;o overlooked, as to alarm the feelings of any per&s;on pre&s;ent, intere&s;ted for their pre&s;ervation. When the &s;ofter &s;ex entru&s;t them&s;elves to our &s;ociety, we &s;hould never for|get the tender re&s;pect due to them even in our gaye&s;t hours: When the higher orders by de|&s;cending, and the lower by a&s;cending out of their &s;phere meet upon the level of good fellow|&s;hip, let not our &s;uperiors be revolted by a ru&s;ti|city however jovial, nor driven back into their fa&s;tne&s;&s;es by our over&s;tepping the partition line, and making &s;aucy inroads into their proper quarters.

once in &s;even years is often enough for the levelling familiarity of electioneering manners.</P>
<P>There is another remark, which I cannot ex|cu&s;e my&s;elf from making, if it were only for the &s;ake of tho&s;e luckle&s;s beings, who being born with duller faculties, or &s;tampt by the hand of nature with oddities either of humour, or of per&s;on, &s;eem to be &s;et up in &s;ociety as butts for the arrows of raillery and ridicule: If the ob|ject, thus made the victim of the company, feels the &s;haft, who but mu&s;t &s;uffer with him? If he feels it not, we blu&s;h for human nature, who&s;e dignity is &s;acrificed in his per&s;on; and as for the profe&s;t buffoon, I take him to have as little preten&s;ions to true humour, as a pun&s;ter has to true wit. There is &s;cope enough for all the eccentricities of character without turning cruel|ty into &s;port; let &s;atire take it's &s;hare, but let vice only &s;hrink before it; let it &s;ilence the tongue that wantonly violates truth, or defames reputation; let it batter the in&s;ulting towers of pride, but let the air-built ca&s;tles of vanity, much more the humble roof of the indigent and infirm never provoke it's &s;pleen.</P>
<P>It happened to me not long ago to fall into company with &s;ome very re&s;pectable per&s;ons, chiefly of the mercantile order, where a country

Such conver&s;ation was ill calculated for the company pre&s;ent, the majority of whom had I dare &s;ay been the founders of their own fortunes, and I &s;hould doubt if there was any quarter of the globe acce&s;&s;ible to commerce, which had not been re&s;orted to by &s;ome one or other then &s;it|ting at the table. This unintere&s;ting egoti&s;t therefore was the more unpardonable, as he &s;hut out every topic of curious and amu&s;ing informa|tion, which could no where meet a happier op|portunity for di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>He was endured for a con&s;iderable time with that patience which is natural to men of good manners and experience in the world: This encouragement only rendered him more in&s;up|portable; when at la&s;t an elderly gentleman &s;eized the opportunity of a &s;hort pau&s;e in his di&s;cour&s;e to addre&s;s the following reproof to this eternal talker.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"The poets you have named will never be mentioned by me but with a degree of enthu|&s;ia&s;m, which I &s;hould rather expect to be ac|cu&s;ed of carrying to exce&s;s than of erring in the oppo&s;ite extreme, had you not put me on my guard again&s;t partiality by charging me with it beforehand.

<P><Q REND="inline">"For let us con&s;ider the two great &s;triking features of his drama, &s;ublimity and character, Now &s;ublimity involves &s;entiment and expre&s;|&s;ion; the fir&s;t of the&s;e is in the &s;oul of the poet; it is that portion of in&s;piration, which we per&s;onify when we call it <HI>the Mu&s;e</HI>; &s;o

far I am free to acknowledge there is no im|mediate rea&s;on to be given, why her vi&s;its &s;hould be confined to any age, nation or per|&s;on; &s;he may fire the heart of the poet on the &s;hores of Ionia three thou&s;and years ago, or on the banks of the Cam or I&s;is at the pre&s;ent moment; but &s;o far as language is concerned, I may venture to &s;ay that modern diction will never &s;trike modern ears with that awful kind of magic, which antiquity gives to words and phra&s;es no longer in familiar u&s;e: In this re|&s;pect our great dramatic poet hath an advan|tage over his di&s;tant de&s;cendants, which he owes to time, and which of cour&s;e is one more than he is indebted for to his own pre|eminent genius. As for character, which I &s;ugge&s;ted as one of the two mo&s;t &s;triking fea|tures of Shake&s;pear's drama, (or in other words the true and perfect delineation of nature), in this our poet is indeed a ma&s;ter unrivalled; yet who will not allow the happy coincidence of time for this perfection in a writer of the drama? The different orders of men, which Shake&s;pear &s;aw and copied, are in many in&s;tances extinct, and &s;uch mu&s;t have the charms of novelty at lea&s;t in our eyes: And has the modern dramati&s;t the &s;ame rich

The level manners of a poli&s;hed age furni&s;h little choice to an author, who now enters on the ta&s;k, in which &s;uch numbers have gone before him, and &s;o exhau&s;ted the materials, that it is ju&s;tly to be wondered at, when any thing like va|riety can be &s;truck out. Dramatic characters are pourtraits drawn from nature, and if all the &s;itters have a family likene&s;s, the arti&s;t mu&s;t either depart from the truth, or pre&s;erve the re&s;emblance; in like manner the poet mu&s;t either invent characters of which there is no counterpart in exi&s;tence, or expo&s;e him&s;elf to the danger of an in&s;ipid and tire|&s;ome repetition: To add to his difficulties it &s;o happens, that the pre&s;ent age, whil&s;t it fur|ni&s;hes le&s;s variety to his choice, requires more than ever for it's own amu&s;ement; the dignity of the &s;tage mu&s;t of cour&s;e be pro&s;ti|tuted to the unnatural re&s;ources of a wild imagination, and it's propriety di&s;turbed; mu&s;ic will &s;upply tho&s;e re&s;ources for a time, and accordingly we find the French and En|gli&s;h theatres in the dearth of character feeding upon the airy diet of &s;ound; but this, with all the &s;upport that &s;pectacle can give, is but a flim&s;y

How many of the&s;e plays, if acted as they were ori|ginally written, would now be permitted to pa&s;s? Can we have a &s;tronger proof of the barbarous ta&s;te of tho&s;e times, in which Titus Andronicus fir&s;t appeared, than the favour, which that horrid &s;pectacle was received with? yet of this we are a&s;&s;ured by Ben John&s;on. If this play was Shake&s;pear's, it was his fir&s;t pro|duction, and &s;ome of his be&s;t commentators are of opinion it was actually written by him, whil&s;t he re&s;ided at Stratford upon Avon. Had this production been followed by the three parts of Henry the Sixth, by Love's Labour Lo&s;t, the Two Gentlemen of Verona, the Comedy of Errors, or &s;ome few others, which our &s;tage does not attempt to reform, that critic mu&s;t have had a very &s;ingular de|gree of intuition, who had di&s;covered in tho&s;e dramas a genius capable of producing the Macbeth.

When I bring to my recollection the &s;everal periods of our Engli&s;h drama &s;ince the age of Shake&s;pear, I could name many dates, when it has been in hands far inferior to the pre|&s;ent, and were it my purpo&s;e to enter into particulars, I &s;hould not &s;cruple to appeal to &s;everal dramatic productions within the com|pa&s;s
<PB N="248" REF="254">
of our own times, but as the ta&s;k of &s;epa|rating and &s;electing one from another among&s;t our own contemporaries can never be a plea&s;ant ta&s;k, nor one I would willingly engage in, I will content my&s;elf with referring to our &s;tock of modern acting plays; many of which having pa&s;&s;ed the ordeal of critics, (who &s;peak the &s;ame language with what I have ju&s;t now heard, and are continually crying down tho&s;e they live with) may perhaps take their turn with po&s;terity, and be hereafter as partially overrated upon a compari&s;on with the produc|tions of the age to come, as they are now un|dervalued when compared with tho&s;e of the ages pa&s;t."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"With regard to Milton, if we could not name any one epic poet of our nation &s;ince his time, it would be &s;aying no more of us than may be &s;aid of the world in general from the aera of Homer to that of Virgil. Greece had one &s;tandard epic poet; Rome had no more; England has her Milton. If Dryden pronounced that <HI>the force of nature could no further go,</HI> he was at once a good authority and a &s;trong example of the truth of the a&s;&s;er|tion: If his genius &s;hrunk from the under|taking, can we wonder that &s;o few have
<PB N="249" REF="255">
taken it up? Yet we will not forget Leonidas, nor &s;peak &s;lightly of it's merit; and as death has removed the worthy author where he can|not hear our prai&s;es, the world may now, as in the ca&s;e of Milton heretofore, be &s;o much the more forward to be&s;tow them. If the Samp|&s;on Agoni&s;tes is nearer to the &s;implicity of it's Grecian original than either our own Elfrida or Caractacus, tho&s;e dramas have a tender in|tere&s;t, a pathetic delicacy, which in that are wanting; and though Comus has every charm of language, it has a vein of allegory, that impoveri&s;hes the mine."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The variety of Dryden's genius was &s;uch as to preclude compari&s;on, were I di&s;po&s;ed to attempt it. Of his dramatic productions he him&s;elf declares <HI>that he never wrote any thing in that way to plea&s;e him&s;elf but his All for Love.</HI> For ever under arms he lived in a continual &s;tate of poetic warfare with his contempora|ries, galling and galled by turns; he &s;ub&s;i&s;ted al&s;o by expedients, and nece&s;&s;ity, which forced his genius into quicker growth than was na|tural to it, made a rich harve&s;t but &s;lovenly hu&s;bandry; it drove him al&s;o into a duplicity of character that is painful to reflect upon; it put him ill at ea&s;e within him&s;elf, and verified

<P><Q REND="inline">"Pope's ver&s;ification gave the la&s;t and fini&s;h|ing poli&s;h to our Engli&s;h poetry: His lyre more &s;weet than Dryden's was le&s;s &s;onorous; his touch more correct, but not &s;o bold; his &s;train more mu&s;ical in it's tones, but not &s;o &s;triking in it's effect: Review him as a critic, and review him throughout, you will pro|nounce him the mo&s;t perfect poet in our lan|guage; read him as an enthu&s;ia&s;t and exa|mine him in detail, you cannot refu&s;e him your approbation, but your rapture you will re&s;erve for Dryden."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But you will tell me this does not apply to the que&s;tion in di&s;pute, and that, in&s;tead of &s;ettling precedency between your poets, it is time for me to produce my own: For this I &s;hall beg your excu&s;e; my zeal for my con|temporaries &s;hall not hurry them into compa|ri&s;ons, which their own mode&s;ty would revolt from; it hath prompted me to intrude upon your patience, whil&s;t I &s;ubmitted a few miti|gating con&s;iderations in their behalf; not as an an&s;wer to your challenge, but as an effort to &s;often your contempt.

<PB N="255" REF="261">
it again&s;t him: To do him ju&s;tice he fairly of|fered to be ruled by your advice, and willed me to write to you on the matter; but one thing or other always &s;tood in the way, and in the mean time came lord Ramble in his way to Dover, and being a great crony of Tom's and very eager for his company, and no letter coming from you (which indeed I acquit you of, not having writ|ten to you on the &s;ubject) away the young&s;ters went together, and probably before this are upon French ground. Pray tell me what you think of this trip, which appears to me but a wild-goo&s;e kind of a chace, and if I live till to-morrow I intend to write Tom a piece of my mind to that purpo&s;e, and give him a few whole&s;ome hints, which I had put together for our parting, but had not time ju&s;t then to communicate to him.</P>
<P>I intend very &s;hortly to bru&s;h up your quar|ters in town, as my &s;olicitor writes me word every thing is at a &s;tand for want of my appear|ance: What dilatory doings mu&s;t we experi|ence, who have to do with the law! putting off from month to month and year to year: I won|der men of bu&s;ine&s;s are not a&s;hamed of them|&s;elves; as for me, I &s;hould have been up and among&s;t them long enough ago, if it had not
<PB N="256" REF="262">
been for one thing or another that hampered me about my journey: Hor&s;es are for ever falling lame, and farriers are &s;uch lazy ra&s;cals, that be|fore one can be cured, another cries out; and now I am in daily expectation of my favourite brood-mare dropping a foal, which I am in great hopes will prove a colt, and therefore I cannot be ab&s;ent at the time, for a ma&s;ter's eye you know is every thing in tho&s;e ca&s;es: Be&s;ides I &s;hould be &s;orry to come up in this dripping &s;ea&s;on, and as the par&s;on has begun praying for fair weather, I hope it will &s;et in ere long in good earne&s;t, and that it will plea&s;e God to make it plea&s;ant tra|velling.</P>
<P>You will be plea&s;ed to hear that I mean &s;oon to make a job of draining the mar&s;h in front of my hou&s;e: Every body allows that as &s;oon as there is a channel cut to the river, it will be as dry as a bowling-green and as fine meadow land as any on my e&s;tate: It will al&s;o add con&s;i|derably to the health as well as beauty of our &s;i|tuation, for at pre&s;ent 'tis a grievous eye-&s;ore, and fills us with fogs and foul air at &s;uch a rate, that I have had my whole family down with the ague all this &s;pring: Here is a fellow ready to undertake the job at a very ea&s;y expence and will complete it in a week, &s;o that it will &s;oon be
<PB N="257" REF="263">
done when once begun; therefore you &s;ee I need not hurry my&s;elf for &s;etting about it, but wait till lei&s;ure and opportunity &s;uit.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry I can &s;end you no better news of your old friend the vicar; he is &s;adly out of &s;orts: You mu&s;t know the incumbent of <HI>Slow-in-the-Wilds</HI> died &s;ome time ago, and as the living lies &s;o handy to my own pari&s;h I had al|ways intended it for our friend, and had promi&s;ed him again and again: When behold! time &s;lipt away unperceived, and in came my lord bi&s;hop of the dioce&s;e with a par&s;on of his own, ready cut and dried, and claimed it as a lap&s;ed living, when it has been mine and my ance&s;tors any time the&s;e five hundred years for aught I know: If the&s;e are not nimble doings I know not what are: Egad! a man need have all his eyes about him, that has to do with the&s;e bi&s;hops. If I had been aware of &s;uch a trick being played me, I would have hoi&s;ted the hone&s;t vicar into the pul|pit before the old par&s;on, who is dead and gone, had been nailed in his coffin; for no man loves le&s;s to be taken napping (as they call it) than I do; and as for the poor vicar 'tis &s;urprizing to &s;ee how he takes to heart the di&s;appointment; whereas I tell him he has nothing for it but to outlive the young fellow, who has jumped into
<PB N="258" REF="264">
his &s;hoes, and then let us &s;ee if any bi&s;hop &s;hall jockey us with the like jade's trick for the fu|ture.</P>
<P>I have now only to reque&s;t you will &s;end me down a new almanack, for the year wears out apace, and I am terribly puzzled for want of knowing how it goes, and I love to be regular. If there is any thing I can do for you in the&s;e parts, pray employ me, for I flatter my&s;elf you believe no man living would go further, or more readily fly to do you &s;ervice than your's to com|mand,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Alas! though the wi&s;e men in all ages have been calling out as it were with one voice for us <HI>to know our&s;elves,</HI> it is a voice that has not yet reached the ears or under&s;tanding of my corre|&s;pondent Tom Tortoi&s;e. Somebody or other hath left us another good maxim, <HI>never to put off till to-morrow what we can do to-day.</HI>&mdash;Whe|ther he was indeed a wi&s;e man, who fir&s;t broached this maxim, I'll not take on my&s;elf to pronounce, but I am apt to think he would be no fool, who ob&s;erved it.</P>
<P>If all the re&s;olutions, promi&s;es and engage|ments of To-day, that lie over for To-morrow,
<PB N="259" REF="265">
were to be &s;ummed up and po&s;ted by items, what a cumbrous load of procra&s;tinations would be transferred in the midnight cri&s;is of a mo|ment! Something perhaps like the following might be the outline of the deed, by which To|day might will and devi&s;e the afore&s;aid contin|gencies to its heir and &s;ucce&s;&s;or.</P>
<Q><P>Con&s;cious that my exi&s;tence is drawing to its clo&s;e, I hereby devi&s;e and make over to my natural heir and &s;ucce&s;&s;or all my right and title in tho&s;e many vows, promi&s;es and obliga|tions, which have been &s;o liberally made to me by &s;undry per&s;ons in my life time, but which &s;till remain unfulfilled on their part, and &s;tand out again&s;t them: But at the &s;ame time that I am heartily de&s;irous all engagements, fair and lawful in their nature, may be punctually complied with, I do mo&s;t willingly cancel all &s;uch as are of a contrary de&s;cription; hereby relea&s;ing and di&s;charging all manner of per|&s;ons, who have bound them&s;elves to me under ra&s;h and incon&s;iderate re&s;olutions, from the performance of which evil might en&s;ue to them&s;elves, and wrong or violence be done to &s;ociety.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place I de&s;ire my &s;aid heir and &s;ucce&s;&s;or will call in all tho&s;e debts of con|&s;cience,
<PB N="260" REF="266">
which have been incurred by, and are due from, certain defaulters, who &s;tand pledged to repentance and atonement, of all which im|mediate payment ought in ju&s;tice and di&s;cre|tion to be rigorou&s;ly exacted from the &s;everal parties, fora&s;much as every hour, by which they outrun their debt, weakens their &s;ecu|rity.</P>
<P>It is my further will and de&s;ire, that all tho&s;e free livers and profe&s;t voluptuaries, who have wa&s;ted the hours of my exi&s;tence in riot and debauchery, may be made to pay down their lawful quota of &s;ick &s;tomachs and aching heads, to be levied upon them &s;everally by poll at the di&s;cretion of my heir and &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>Whereas I am apprized of many dark deal|ings and malicious de&s;igns now in actual exe|cution to the great annoyance of &s;ociety and good-fellow&s;hip, I earne&s;tly recommend the detection of all &s;uch evil-minded per&s;ons with To-morrow's light, heartily hoping they will meet their due &s;hame, puni&s;hment and di&s;ap|pointment: And I &s;incerely wi&s;h that every hone&s;t man, who hath this night gone to re&s;t with a good reputation, may not be deprived of To-morrow's repo&s;e by any ba&s;e efforts,
<PB N="261" REF="267">
which Slander, who works in the dark, may conjure up to take it from him.</P>
<P>It is with &s;ingular &s;atisfaction I have been made privy to &s;undry kind and charitable be|nevolences, that have been privately be&s;towed upon the indigent and di&s;tre&s;t, without any o&s;tentation or parade on the part of the givers, and I do thereupon &s;trictly enjoin and require a fair and impartial account to be taken of the &s;ame by my lawful heir and &s;ucce&s;&s;or, (be the amount what it may) that intere&s;t for the &s;ame may be put into immediate cour&s;e of payment; whereby the parties &s;o intitled may enjoy, as in ju&s;tice they ought to do, all tho&s;e comforts, ble&s;&s;ings and rewards, which talents &s;o employed are calculated to produce.</P>

<P>IT is wonderful to me that any man will &s;ur|render him&s;elf to be the &s;lave of peevi&s;h and ira&s;cible humours, that annoy his peace, impair his health and hurt his reputation. Who does not love to be greeted in &s;ociety with a &s;mile? Who lives that is in&s;en&s;ible to the frowns, the &s;neers, the cur&s;es of his neighbours? What can be more delightful than to enter our own doors 2amid&s;t the congratulations of a whole family, and to bring a chearful heart into a chearful hou&s;e? Fooli&s;h, contemptible &s;elf-tormentors ye are, whom every little accident irritates, every
<PB N="263" REF="269">
&s;light omi&s;&s;ion piques! Surely we &s;hould guard our pa&s;&s;ions as we would any other combu&s;ti|bles, and not &s;pread open the inflammable maga|zine to catch the fir&s;t &s;park, that may blow it and our&s;elves into the air.</P>
<P><HI>Tom Tinder</HI> is one of the&s;e touchy blockheads, whom no body can endure: The fellow has not a &s;ingle plea in life for his ill temper; he does not want money, is not married, has a great deal of health to &s;pare and never once felt the &s;lighte&s;t twinge of the gout. His eyes no &s;ooner open to the morning light than he begins to quarrel with the weather; it rains, and he wanted to ride; it is &s;un&s;hine, and he meant to go a fi&s;h|ing; he would hunt only when it is a fro&s;t, and never thinks of &s;kaiting but in open weather; in &s;hort the wind is never in the right quarter with this te&s;ty fellow; and though I could excu&s;e a man for being a little out of humour with an ea&s;terly wind, Tom Tinder &s;hall box the whole compa&s;s, and never &s;et his needle to a &s;ingle point of good humour upon the face of it.</P>
<P>He now rings his bell for his &s;ervant to begin the operation of dre&s;&s;ing him, a ta&s;k more tick|li&s;h than to wait upon the toilette of a monkey: As Tom &s;hifts his &s;ervants about as regularly as he does his &s;hirt, 'tis all the world to nothing if
<PB N="264" REF="270">
the poor devil does not &s;tumble at &s;tarting; or if by happy in&s;piration he &s;hould begin with the right foot foremo&s;t, Tom has another in&s;piration ready at command to quarrel with him for not &s;etting forward with the left: To a certainty then the razor wants &s;trapping, the &s;having water is &s;moaked, and the devil's in the fellow for a dunce, booby and blockhead.</P>
<P>Tom now comes down to breakfa&s;t, and though the &s;avage has the &s;tomach of an o&s;trich, there is not a mor&s;el pa&s;&s;es down his bla&s;phem|ing throat without a damn to dige&s;t it; 'twould be a le&s;s dangerous ta&s;k to &s;erve in the morning me&s;s to a fa&s;ting bear. He then walks forth into his garden; there he does not meet a plant, which his ill-humour does not engraft with the bitter fruit of cur&s;ing; the wa&s;ps have pierced his nectarines; the caterpillars have rai&s;ed con|tributions upon his cabbages, and the infernal blackbirds have eaten up all his cherries: Tom's &s;oul is not large enough to allow the denizens of creation a ta&s;te of Nature's gifts, though he &s;urfeits with the &s;uperabundance of her bounty.</P>
<P>He next takes a turn about his farm; there vexation upon vexation cro&s;&s;es him at every cor|ner: The fly, a plague upon't, has got among&s;t
<PB N="265" REF="271">
his turnips; the &s;mut has &s;eized his wheat and his &s;heep are falling down with the rot: All this is the fault of his bailiff, and at his door the blame lies with a proportionable quantity of ble&s;&s;ings to recommend it. He finds a few dry &s;ticks pickt out of his hedges, and he bla&s;ts all the poor in his neighbourhood for a &s;et of thieves, pilferers and vagabonds. He meets one of his tenants by the way, and he has a petition for a new gate to his farm-yard, or &s;ome repairs to his dove-hou&s;e, or it may be a new thre&s;hing-floor to his barn&mdash;Hell and fury! there is no end to the demands of the&s;e cur&s;ed farmers&mdash;His &s;tomach ri&s;es at the reque&s;t, and he turns a&s;ide &s;peechle&s;s with rage, and in this humour pays a vi&s;it to his ma&s;ons and carpenters, who are at work upon a building he is adding to his offices: Here his choler in&s;tead of &s;ub&s;iding only flames more fu|riou&s;ly, for the idle ra&s;cals have done nothing; &s;ome have been making holiday, others have gone to the fair at the next town, and the ma&s;ter workman has fallen from the &s;caffold, and keeps his bed with the brui&s;es: Every devil is con|jured up from the bottomle&s;s pit to come on earth and confound the&s;e dilatory mi&s;creants; and now let him go to his dinner with what &s;to|mach he may. If an humble par&s;on or depen|dant
<PB N="266" REF="272">
cou&s;in expects a peaceful meal at his table, he may as well &s;it down to feed with Thye&s;tes or the Centaurs. After a meal of mi&s;ery and a gla&s;s of wine, which ten to one but the infernal butler has clouded in the decanting, he is &s;um|moned to a game at back-gammon: The par&s;on throws &s;ize-ace, and in a few more ca&s;ts covers all his points; the devil's in the dice! Tom makes a blot, and the par&s;on hits it; he takes up man after man, all his points are full and Tom is gammoned pa&s;t redemption&mdash;Can fle&s;h and blood bear this? Was ever &s;uch a run of luck? The dice-box is &s;lapt down with a ven|geance; the tables ring with the deafening cra&s;h, the par&s;on &s;tands agha&s;t, and Tom &s;tamps the floor in the phrenzy of pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;De&s;picable pa&s;|&s;ion! mi&s;erable dependant!&mdash;</P>
<P>Where is his next re&s;ource? the par&s;on has fled the pit; the back-gammon table is clo&s;ed; no chearful neighbour knocks at his un&s;ocial gate; &s;ilence and night and &s;olitude are his me|lancholy inmates; his boiling bo&s;om labours like a turbid &s;ea after the winds are lulled; &s;hame &s;tares him in the face; con&s;cience plucks at his heart, and to divert his own tormenting thoughts, he calls in tho&s;e of another per&s;on, no matter whom&mdash;the fir&s;t idle author that &s;tands next to his
<PB N="267" REF="273">
hand: he takes up a book; 'tis a volume of co|medies; he opens it at random; 'tis all alike to him where he begins; all our poets put together are not worth a halter; he &s;tumbles by mere chance upon <HI>The Choleric Man</HI>; 'twas one to a thou&s;and he &s;hould &s;trike upon that bla&s;ted play&mdash;What an infernal title! What execrable non|&s;en&s;e! What a canting, preaching puppy of an author!&mdash;Away goes the poet with his play and half a dozen better poets than him&s;elf bound up in the &s;ame luckle&s;s volume, the innocent &s;uffer|ers for his offence.</P>
<P>Tom now &s;its forlorn, di&s;gu&s;ted, without a friend living or dead to chear him, gnawing his own heart for want of other diet to feed his &s;pleen upon: At length he &s;links into a com|fortle&s;s bed; damns his &s;ervant as he draws the curtains round him, drops a&s;leep and dreams of the devil.</P>
<P><HI>Major Manlove</HI> is a near neighbour, but no intimate of Tom Tinder's: With the enjoy|ments, that re&s;ult from health, the major is but rarely ble&s;t, for a body-wound, which he re|ceived in battle, is apt upon certain changes of the climate to vi&s;it him with acute pains. He is married to one of the be&s;t of women; but &s;he too has impaired her health by nur&s;ing him
<PB N="268" REF="274">
when he was wounded, and is &s;ubject to &s;evere rheumatic attacks. Love however has an opiate for all her pains, and dome&s;tic peace pours a bal&s;am into the hu&s;band's wound. It is only by the &s;crutinizing eye of affection, that either can di&s;cover when the other &s;uffers, for religion has endued both hearts with patience, and neither will permit a complaint to e&s;cape, which might invite the &s;ympathizing friend to &s;hare it's an|gui&s;h. Di&s;abled for &s;ervice, major Manlove has retired upon half-pay, and as he plundered neither the enemy's country nor his own during the war, he is not burthened with the &s;uperfluities of fortune; happily for him the&s;e are not among&s;t his regrets, and a prudent oeconomy keeps him &s;trait with the world and indepen|dant.</P>
<P>One brave youth, trained under his own eye in the &s;ame regiment with him&s;elf, is all the off|&s;pring Heaven hath be&s;towed upon this worthy father, and in him the hearts of the fond parents are centered; yet not &s;o centered, as to &s;hut them again&s;t the general calls of philanthropy, for in the village where they live they are be|loved and ble&s;&s;ed by every creature. The gar|den furni&s;hes amu&s;ement to Mrs. Manlove, and when the &s;harp north ea&s;t does not blow pain
<PB N="269" REF="275">
into the major's wound, he is occupied with his farm: His trees, his crop, his cattle are his nur&s;elings, and the poor that labour in his &s;ervice are his children and friends. To his &s;uperiors major Manlove deports him&s;elf with that grace|ful re&s;pect, that puts them in mind of their own dignity without dimini&s;hing his; to his inferiors he is ever kind and conde&s;cending: To all men he maintains a natural &s;incerity with a counte|nance &s;o expre&s;&s;ive of the benevolence, glowing in his heart, that he is beloved as &s;oon as known, and known as &s;oon as &s;een. With a &s;oul formed for &s;ociety, and a lively flow of &s;pirits, this amiable man no &s;ooner enters into company, than his pre&s;ence diffu&s;es joy and glad|ne&s;s over the whole circle: Every voice bids him welcome; every hand is reached out to greet him with a cordial &s;hake. He &s;its down with a complacent &s;mile; chimes in with the conver&s;ation as it is going, hears all, overbears none, damps nobody's je&s;t, if it is harmle&s;s; cuts no man's &s;tory, if it is only tedious, and is the very life and &s;oul of the table.</P>
<P>According to annual cu&s;tom I pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome days with him la&s;t autumn: There is a tranquil|lity, which tran&s;pires from the ma&s;ter and mi&s;|tre&s;s of this family through every member be|longing
<PB N="270" REF="276">
to it; the &s;ervants are few, but &s;o a&s;&s;i|duous in their re&s;pective &s;tations, that you can no where be better waited on: The table is plain, but elegant, and though the major him&s;elf is no &s;port&s;man, and has done carrying a gun, the kindne&s;s of his neighbours keeps him well &s;upplied with game, and every &s;ort of rural luxury, that their farms and gardens can furni&s;h. Nothing can be more delightful than the face of the country about him, and I was charmed with his little ornamented farm in particular: The di&s;|po&s;ition of the garden, and the abundance of it's fruits and flowers be&s;peak Mrs. Manlove no common adept in that &s;weet and captivating &s;cience.</P>
<P>One day as my friend and I were riding through his fields to enjoy the we&s;tern breeze of a fine September morning, our ears were &s;aluted with the full chorus of the hounds from a neigh|bouring cop&s;e, and as we were cro&s;&s;ing one of the pa&s;tures towards them, we heard two men at high words behind a thick hedge, that concealed them from our fight, and &s;oon after the &s;ound of blows, which &s;eemed to be heavily laid on, accompanied with oaths and cries, that made us pu&s;h to the next gate with all the &s;peed we could mu&s;ter. One of the
<PB N="271" REF="277">
combatants was lying on the ground, roaring for mercy under the cudgel of his conqueror, who was belaboring him at a furious rate: The per&s;on of the victor was unknown to major Manlove; the vanqui&s;ht &s;oon made him recog|nize the rue&s;ul features of Tom Tinder, who called upon the major by name to interpo&s;e and &s;ave him from being murdered.</P>
<P>This was no &s;ooner done than the cudgeller, who was a &s;turdy clown, gave us to under&s;tand, that he had been doing no more than every Engli&s;hman has a right to do, returning the loan of a blow with proper intere&s;t to the lender: This the pro&s;trate hero did not deny, but a&s;&s;erted that the ra&s;cal had headed the hare as &s;he was breaking cover, and turned her into the wood again, by which means he had &s;poilt the day's &s;port.&mdash;And did you this de&s;ignedly? &s;aid the major.&mdash;Not I, ma&s;ter, replied the countryman, as Heaven &s;hall judge me! I love the &s;port too well to &s;poil it wilfully: But if I was travelling along the road ju&s;t as pu&s;s was popping through the hedge, could I help it? am I in the fault? And &s;hould this gentleman, if he be a gentleman, ride up to me as if he would have trampled me like a dog under his hor&s;e's feet, and lay the butt of his whip upon my &s;cull? I think no man can
<PB N="272" REF="278">
bear that; &s;o I pulled him out of the &s;addle, and banged him well, and I think no good man, as you appear to be, will &s;ay otherwi&s;e than that he well de&s;erved it.&mdash;If this be &s;o, an&s;wered the ma|jor, I can &s;ay nothing to the contrary.&mdash;How, &s;ir, exclaimed the &s;quire, who was now upon his legs, is a ra&s;cal like this to return blow for blow, and does major Manlove abet him in &s;uch in&s;olence?&mdash;I am &s;orry, &s;ir, replied the ma|jor calmly, you &s;hould put &s;uch a que&s;tion to me; but when gentlemen lo&s;e their temper&mdash;Sir, quoth Tom, interrupting him, I have lo&s;t my hor&s;e, and that's the wor&s;e lo&s;s of the two&mdash;'Tis what you are lea&s;t u&s;ed to, replied the ma|jor, and without more words quietly trotted homewards.</P>
<P>As we jogged along my friend began to com|ment with much plea&s;antry upon this ridiculous incident, interlarding his di&s;cour&s;e every now and then with remarks of a more &s;erious &s;ort upon the ill effects of a ha&s;ty temper, and giving me &s;ome traits of his neighbour's habits of life, which, though not &s;o uncommon as I could wi&s;h, were neverthele&s;s &s;uch, as, when contra&s;ted with his benevolent character, may perhaps &s;erve to furni&s;h out no very unedifying topic for an E&s;&s;ay in <HI>The Ob&s;erver.</HI></P>

<P>IN times of very remote antiquity, when men were not &s;o lavi&s;h of their wit as they have &s;ince been, Poetry could not furni&s;h employment for more than <HI>Three Mu&s;es</HI>; but as bu&s;ine&s;s grew upon their hands and departments multi|plied, it became nece&s;&s;ary to enlarge the com|mi&s;&s;ion and a board was con&s;tituted con&s;i&s;ting of <HI>Nine</HI> in number, who had their &s;everal pre&s;iden|cies allotted to them, and every branch of the art poetic thenceforth had its peculiar patrone&s;s and &s;uperintendant.</P>
<P>As to the preci&s;e time when the&s;e three &s;enior godde&s;&s;es called in their &s;ix new a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors it is matter of conjecture only; but if the poet <HI>He|&s;iod</HI> was, as we are told, the fir&s;t, who had the honour of announcing their names and charac|ters to the world, we may rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e this was done upon the immediate opening of their new commi&s;&s;ion, as they would hardly en|ter
<PB N="274" REF="280">
upon their offices without appri&s;ing all tho&s;e, whom it might concern, of their acce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Before this period the three elde&s;t &s;i&s;ters con|de&s;cended to be <HI>maids of all work</HI>; and if the work became more than they could turn their hands to, they have nobody but them&s;elves and their fellow deities to complain of; for had they been content to have let the world go on in its natural cour&s;e, mere mortal poets would not pro|bably have overburthened either it or them; but when Apollo him&s;elf (who being their pre&s;ident &s;hould have had more con&s;ideration for their ea&s;e) begot the poet <HI>Linus</HI> in one of his terre&s;|trial frolics, and endowed him with hereditary genius, he took a certain method to make work for the mu&s;es: Accordingly we find the cha&s;te Calliope her&s;elf, the elde&s;t of the &s;i&s;terhood, and who &s;hould have &s;et a better example to the fa|mily, could not hold out again&s;t this heavenly ba&s;tard, but in an unguarded moment yielded her virgin honours to <HI>Linus,</HI> and produced the poet <HI>Orpheus:</HI> Such an in&s;tance of cele&s;tial inconti|nence could not fail to &s;hake the morals of the mo&s;t demure; and even the cold godde&s;s Luna caught the flame, and &s;muggled a bantling into the world, whom maliciou&s;ly enough &s;he named <HI>Mu&s;aeus,</HI> with a &s;ly de&s;ign no doubt of laying
<PB N="275" REF="281">
her child at the door of the Parna&s;&s;ian nun|nery.</P>
<P>Three &s;uch high-blooded bards as <HI>Linus, Orpheus</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;aeus,</HI> &s;o fathered and &s;o mo|thered, were enough to people all Greece with poets and mu&s;icians; and in truth they were not idle in their generation, but like true patriarchs &s;pread their families over all the &s;hores of Ionia and the i&s;lands of the Archipelago: It is not therefore to be wondered at, if the three &s;i&s;ter mu&s;es, who had enough to do to nur&s;e their own children and de&s;cendants, were di&s;po&s;ed to call in other helpmates to the ta&s;k, and whil&s;t Greece was in its glory, it may well be &s;uppo&s;ed that all the nine &s;i&s;ters were fully employed in be&s;towing upon every votary a portion of their attention, and an&s;wering every call made upon them for aid and in&s;piration: Much gratitude is due to them from their favoured poets, and much hath been paid, for even to the pre&s;ent hour they are in|voked and wor&s;hipped by the &s;ons of ver&s;e, whil&s;t all the other deities of Olympus have either ab|dicated their thrones, or been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from them with contempt; even Milton him&s;elf in his &s;a|cred epic invokes the <HI>heavenly mu&s;e,</HI> who in&s;pired Mo&s;es <HI>on the top of Horeb or of Sinai</HI>; by which
<PB N="276" REF="282">
he a&s;cribes great antiquity as well as dignity to the character he addre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The powers a&s;cribed to <HI>Orpheus</HI> were under the veil of fable emblems of his influence over &s;avage minds, and of his wi&s;dom and eloquence in reclaiming them from that barbarous &s;tate: Upon the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions civilization and &s;ociety took place: The patriarch, who founded a fa|mily or tribe, the legi&s;lator, who e&s;tabli&s;hed a &s;tate, the prie&s;t, prophet, judge or king, are cha|racters, which, if traced to their fir&s;t &s;ources, will be found to branch from that of poet: The fir&s;t prayers, the fir&s;t laws and the earlie&s;t pro|phecies were metrical; pro&s;e hath a later origin, and before the art of writing was in exi&s;tence, poetry had reached a very high degree of excel|lence and &s;ome of it's noble&s;t productions were no otherwi&s;e pre&s;erved than by tradition. As to the &s;acred quality of their fir&s;t poetry the Greeks are agreed, and to give their early bards the better title to in&s;piration they feign them to be de&s;cended from the Gods; <HI>Orpheus</HI> mu&s;t have profited by his mother's partiality, and <HI>Linus</HI> may well be &s;uppo&s;ed to have had &s;ome intere&s;t with his father Apollo. But to dwell no longer on the&s;e fabulous legends of the Greeks, we may refer to the books of Mo&s;es for the earlie&s;t
<PB N="277" REF="283">
and mo&s;t authentic examples of &s;acred poetry: Every thing that was the immediate effu&s;ion of the prophetic &s;pirit &s;eems to have been chaunted. forth in dithyrambic mea&s;ure; the valedictory ble&s;&s;ings of the Patriarchs, when dying, the &s;ongs of triumph and thank&s;giving after victory are metrical, and high as the antiquity of the &s;acred poem of Job undoubtedly is, &s;uch neverthele&s;s is its character and con&s;truction as to carry &s;trong internal marks of its being written in an advanced &s;tate of the art.</P>
<P>The poet therefore, whether Hebrew or Greek, was in the earlie&s;t ages a &s;acred character, and his talent a divine gift, a cele&s;tial in&s;piration: Men regarded him as the amba&s;&s;ador of Heaven and the interpreter of it's will. It is perfectly in nature and no le&s;s agreeable to God's provi|dence to &s;uppo&s;e that even in the darke&s;t times &s;ome minds of a more enlightened &s;ort &s;hould break forth, and be engaged in the contempla|tion of the univer&s;e and its author: From medi|tating upon the works of the Creator the tran&s;i|tion to the act of prai&s;e and adoration follows as it were of cour&s;e: The&s;e are operations of the mind, which naturally in&s;pire it with a certain portion of rapture and enthu&s;ia&s;m, ru&s;hing upon the lips in warm and glowing language, and di&s;|daining
<PB N="278" REF="284">
to be expre&s;&s;ed in ordinary and vulgar phra&s;e; the thoughts become inflated, the brea&s;t labours with a pa&s;&s;ionate de&s;ire to &s;ay &s;omething worthy of the ear of Heaven, &s;omething in a more elevated tone and cadence, &s;omething more harmonious and mu&s;ical; this can only be effected by mea&s;ured periods, by &s;ome chaunt, that can be repeated in the &s;train again and again, grateful at once to the ear and impre&s;&s;ive on the memory; and what is this but poetry? Poetry then is the language of prayer, an addre&s;s becoming of the Deity; it may be remembered; it may be repeated in the ears of the people called together for the purpo&s;es of wor&s;hip; this is a form that may be fixt upon their minds and in this they may be taught to join.</P>
<P>The next &s;tep in the progre&s;s of poetry from the prai&s;e of God is to the prai&s;e of men: Illu&s;|trious characters, heroic actions are &s;ingled out for celebration; the inventors of u&s;eful arts, the reformers of &s;avage countries, the benefactors of mankind are extolled in ver&s;e, they are rai&s;ed to the &s;kies, and the poet, having prai&s;ed them as the fir&s;t of men, whil&s;t on earth, deifies them after death, and, con&s;cious that they merit im|mortality, boldly be&s;tows it, and a&s;&s;igns to them a rank and office in heaven appropriate to the
<PB N="279" REF="285">
character they maintained in life; hence it is that the merits of a Bacchus, a Hercules and numbers more are amplified by the poet, till they become the attributes of their divinity, altars are rai&s;ed and victims immolated to their wor&s;hip. The&s;e are the fanciful effects of poetry in its &s;e|cond &s;tage: Religion over-heated turns into enthu&s;ia&s;m; enthu&s;ia&s;m forces the imagination into all the vi&s;ionary regions of fable, and idola|try takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole Gentile world. The Egyptians, a my&s;terious dogmatizing race, begin the work with &s;ymbol and hieroglyphic; the Greeks, a vain ingenious people, invent a &s;et of tales and fables for what they do not un|der&s;tand, embelli&s;h them with all the glittering ornaments of poetry, and &s;pread the captivating delu&s;ion over all the world.</P>
<P>In the &s;ucceeding period we review the poet in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this brilliant machinery and with all Olympus at his command: Surrounded by Apollo and the mu&s;es he commences every poem with an addre&s;s to them for protection: He has a deity at his call for every operation of nature; if he would roll the thunder, Jupiter &s;hakes Mount Ida to dignify his de&s;cription; Neptune attends him in his car, if he would allay the ocean; if he would let loo&s;e the winds to
<PB N="280" REF="286">
rai&s;e it Aeolus unbars his cave; the &s;pear of Mars and the aegis of Minerva arm him for the battle; the arrows of Apollo &s;catter pe&s;tilence through the air; Mercury flies upon the me&s;|&s;ages of Jupiter; Juno raves with jealou&s;y and Venus leads the Loves and Graces in her train. In this cla&s;s we contemplate <HI>Homer</HI> and his in|ferior brethren of the epic order; it is their pro|vince to form the warrior, in&s;truct the politician, animate the patriot; they delineate the charac|ters and manners; they charm us with their de|&s;criptions, &s;urprize us with their incidents, in|tere&s;t us with their dialogue; they engage every pa&s;&s;ion in its turn, melt us to pity, rou&s;e us to glory, &s;trike us with terror, fire us with indigna|tion; in a word they prepare us for the drama, and the drama for us.</P>
<P>A new poet now comes upon the &s;tage; he &s;tands in per&s;on before us: He no longer ap|pears as a blind and wandering bard chaunting his rhap&s;odies to a throng of villagers collected in a group about him, but erects a &s;plendid the|atre, gathers together a whole city as his audi|ence, prepares a &s;triking &s;pectacle, provides a chorus of actors, brings mu&s;ic, dance and dre&s;s to his aid, realizes the thunder, bur&s;ts open the tombs of the dead, calls forth their apparitions,
<PB N="281" REF="287">
de&s;cends to the very regions of the damned and drags the Furies from their flames to pre&s;ent them&s;elves per&s;onally to the terrified &s;pectators: Such are the powers of the drama; here the poet reigns and triumphs in his highe&s;t glory.</P>
<P>The fifth denomination gives us the lyric poet chaunting his ode at the public games and fe&s;ti|vals, crowned with olive and encompa&s;&s;ed by all the wits and nobles of his age and country: Here we contemplate <HI>Ste&s;ichorus, Alcaeus, Pin|dar, Calli&s;tratus</HI>; &s;ublime, abrupt, impetuous they &s;trike us with the &s;hock of their electric ge|nius; they dart from earth to heaven; there is no following them in their flights; we &s;tand gaz|ing with &s;urprize, their boldne&s;s awes us, their brevity confounds us; their &s;udden tran&s;itions and ellip&s;es e&s;cape our apprehen&s;ion; we are charmed we know not why, we are plea&s;ed with being puzzled and applaud although we cannot comprehend. In the lighter lyric we meet <HI>Ana|creon, Sappho,</HI> and the votaries of Bacchus and Venus; in the grave, didactic, &s;olemn cla&s;s we have the venerable names of a <HI>Solon,</HI> a <HI>Tyrtaeus</HI> and tho&s;e, who may be &s;tiled the demagogues in poetry: Is liberty to be a&s;&s;erted, licentiou&s;ne&s;s to be repre&s;&s;ed? Is the &s;pirit of a nation to be rou&s;ed? It is the poet not the orator mu&s;t give
<PB N="282" REF="288">
the &s;oul its energy and &s;pring: Is Salamis to be recovered? It is the elegy of <HI>Solon</HI> mu&s;t found the march to it's attack. Are the Lacedaemoni|ans to be awakened from their lethargy? It is <HI>Tyrtaeus,</HI> who mu&s;t &s;ing the war-&s;ong and revive their languid courage.</P>
<P>Poetry next appears in its pa&s;toral character; it affects the garb of &s;hepherds and the language of the ru&s;tic: It repre&s;ents to our view the rural land&s;cape and the peaceful cottage; it records the labours, the amu&s;ements, the loves of the village nymphs and &s;wains, and exhibits nature in its &s;imple&s;t &s;tate: It is no longer the harp or the lyre, but the pipe of the poet, which now in|vites our attention: <HI>Theocritus,</HI> leaning on his crook in his ru&s;&s;et mantle and <HI>clouted brogues,</HI> ap|pears more perfectly in character than the court|ly <HI>Maro,</HI> who &s;eems more the &s;hepherd of the theatre than of the field. I have yet one other cla&s;s in re&s;erve for the epigrammati&s;t, but I will &s;hut up my li&s;t without him, not being willing that poetry, which commences with a prayer, &s;hould conclude with a pun.</P>

<P>WE have heard &s;o much of the tragical ef|fects of jealou&s;y, that I was not a little plea&s;ed with an account lately given me of a gentleman, who has been happily cured of his jealou&s;y without any of tho&s;e melancholy cir|cum&s;tances, which too frequently re&s;ult from that fatal pa&s;&s;ion, even when it is groundle&s;s: As this gentleman's jealou&s;y was of that de&s;crip|tion, I am the rather tempted to relate the &s;tory (under proper caution as to names and per&s;ons) becau&s;e there is a moral ju&s;tice in its cata&s;trophe, which is plea&s;ing even in fiction, but more par|ticularly &s;o when we meet it in the real occur|rences of life.</P>
<P>Sir Paul Te&s;ty in his forty-eighth year mar|ried the beautiful Loui&s;a in her eighteenth; there are &s;ome parents, who &s;eem to think a good &s;et|tlement can atone for any di&s;parity of age, and Loui&s;a's were of this &s;ort. Sir Paul had a mai|den &s;i&s;ter &s;everal years younger than him&s;elf, who had kept his hou&s;e for &s;ome time before his marriage with Loui&s;a, and as this lady was in
<PB N="284" REF="290">
fact an admirable oeconomi&s;t and al&s;o in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of a very con&s;iderable independent fortune, the prudent baronet took his mea&s;ures for her continuance in his family, where under pretence of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the inexperience of his young bride &s;he &s;till maintained her government in as ab&s;o|lute authority as ever: As Mi&s;s Rachel would have been better plea&s;ed with her brother, had he cho&s;en a wife with le&s;s beauty and more for|tune than Loui&s;a brought into the family, it may well be doubted if &s;he would have remained with him after his marriage, had &s;he not been pretty far advanced in an affair of the heart with a cer|tain young gentleman, who&s;e attentions, though in fact directed to her pur&s;e, &s;he was willing to believe had been honourably addre&s;&s;ed to her per|&s;on: This young gentleman, whom I &s;hall call Lionel, was undoubtedly an object well de&s;erv|ing the regards of any lady in Mi&s;s Rachel's pre|dicament; with a fine per&s;on and engaging ad|dre&s;s he had the recommendation of high birth, being a younger &s;on of the Lord Mortimer, a ve|nerable old peer, who re&s;ided at his family man|&s;ion within a few miles of Sir Paul, and lived upon the mo&s;t friendly terms with him in a fre|quent intercour&s;e of vi&s;its: Lionel had given this worthy father great unea&s;ine&s;s from his early
<PB N="285" REF="291">
di&s;&s;ipation and extravagance; con&s;iderable &s;ums had been paid for him to clear his debts, but the old lord's e&s;tate being a moderate one and en|tailed upon his elde&s;t &s;on, Lionel had been obliged to &s;ell out of the army, and was now living at home upon the bounty of his father on a reduced and &s;lender allowance.</P>
<P>It is not to be wondered at that Lionel, who felt his own embara&s;&s;ments too &s;en&s;ibly to neg|lect any fair means of getting rid of them, &s;hould be willing to repair his &s;hattered fortunes by an advantageous match; and though Mi&s;s Rachel was not exactly the lady he would have cho&s;en, yet he very ju&s;tly con&s;idered that his cir|cum&s;tances did not entitle him to chu&s;e for him|&s;elf; he was al&s;o &s;trongly urged to the mea&s;ure by his father, to who&s;e wi&s;hes he held him&s;elf bound to conform not only on the &s;core of duty but of atonement likewi&s;e: At this time the af|fair was in &s;o promi&s;ing a train, that there is lit|tle doubt but it would have been brought to a conclu&s;ion between the parties, had not Sir Paul's marriage taken place as it did; but as Mi&s;s Rachel for rea&s;ons, which are &s;ufficiently explained, determined upon remaining with her brother, the intercour&s;e between the lovers was renewed, as &s;oon as Sir Peter had brought home
<PB N="286" REF="292">
his bride, and was &s;ufficiently &s;ettled to receive the vi&s;its of his friends and neighbours on the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Now it was that the unhappy Rachel became a victim to the mo&s;t tormenting of all human pa&s;&s;ions: her &s;i&s;ter-in-law had a thou&s;and charms, and &s;he &s;oon di&s;covered, or fancied &s;he di&s;|covered, that Lionel's attentions were directed towards a fairer object than her&s;elf: She had now the &s;tronge&s;t of all motives for keeping a watchful eye upon Loui&s;a's behaviour, and it is the property of jealou&s;y to magnify and di&s;colour every thing it looks upon; for &s;ome time how|ever &s;he kept her&s;elf under prudent re&s;traint; a hint now and then, cautiou&s;ly introduced in the way of advice, was all &s;he ventured upon; but the&s;e hints were &s;o little attended to by Loui&s;a, who&s;e innocent gayety lent no ear to &s;uch re|mon&s;trances, that they were occa&s;ionally re|peated in a graver tone; as the&s;e grew more and more peevi&s;h, Loui&s;a began to take a little mi&s;|chievous plea&s;ure in teazing, and was piqued in|to a behaviour, which probably &s;he would never have indulged her&s;elf in towards Lionel, had not Rachel's jealou&s;y provoked her to it; &s;till it was innocent, but &s;o far imprudent, as it gave a handle to Rachel's malice, who now began to
<PB N="287" REF="293">
&s;ow the &s;eeds of di&s;content in her brother's irri|table bo&s;om.</P>
<P>In one of tho&s;e &s;parring dialogues, which now frequently pa&s;&s;ed between the &s;i&s;ters, Ra|chel, after de&s;canting upon the old topic with &s;ome degree of a&s;perity, concluded her lecture with many profe&s;&s;ions of zeal for Loui&s;a's happine&s;s, and ob&s;erved to her as an apology for the freedom of her advice, that &s;he had a right to &s;ome little experience of the world more than had yet fallen to the other's lot: To which Loui&s;a replied with &s;ome tartne&s;s&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"True! for you have lived more years in it than I have."&mdash;</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"A few perhaps,"</Q> an&s;wered Rachel.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"As few, or as many as you chu&s;e to acknow|ledge,"</Q>
added Loui&s;a:
<Q REND="inline">"It is one among&s;t a variety of advantages over me, which you are too generous to boa&s;t of, and I too humble to repine at."&mdash;</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"Be that as it may,"</Q> &s;aid the elder dam&s;el,
<Q REND="inline">"you will give me leave to ob&s;erve that you have a double call upon you for di&s;|cretion; you are a married woman."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Perhaps that very circum&s;tance may be a proof of my indi&s;cretion."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"How &s;o, madam! I may venture to &s;ay my brother Sir Paul was no un&s;ea&s;onable match for your lady&s;hip; at lea&s;t I can wit|ne&s;s
<PB N="288" REF="294">
&s;ome pains were employed on your part to obtain him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Well, my dear &s;i&s;ter,"</Q> replied Loui&s;a with an affected nonchalance,
<Q REND="inline">"after &s;o much pains is it not natural I &s;hould wi&s;h to repo&s;e my&s;elf a little?"&mdash;</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"Indi&s;cretion admits of no repo&s;e; health, honour, happine&s;s are &s;acrificed by it's effects; it &s;aps the reputation of a wife; it &s;hakes the affections of a hu&s;band."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Be content!"</Q> cried Loui&s;a,
<Q REND="inline">"if you will give no cau&s;e for di&s;turbing the affections of the hu&s;band, I will take care none &s;hall be given for attainting the reputation of the wife."</Q></P>
<P>At this moment Sir Paul entered the room, and perceiving by the countenances of the ladies, that they were not perfectly in good-humour with each other, eagerly demanded of Loui&s;a why &s;he looked &s;o grave.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I would look grave, if I could,"</Q> &s;he replied,
<Q REND="inline">"out of compliment to my company; but I have &s;o light a con&s;cience and &s;o gay a heart, that I cannot look gravity in the face without laughing at it."</Q></P>
<P>This was delivered with &s;o pointed a glance at Rachel, that it was not po&s;&s;ible to mi&s;take the application, and &s;he had no &s;ooner left the room,
<PB N="289" REF="295">
than an explanation took place between the bro|ther and &s;i&s;ter, in the cour&s;e of which Rachel artfully contrived to infu&s;e &s;uch a copious por|tion of her own poi&s;onous jealou&s;y into the bo|&s;om of &s;ir Paul, that upon the arrival of lord Mortimer, which was at this cri&s;is announced to him, he took a &s;udden determination to give him to under&s;tand how nece&s;&s;ary it was become to his dome&s;tic happine&s;s, that Lionel &s;hould be in|duced to di&s;continue his vi&s;its in his family.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions and in a very awk|ward &s;tate of mind Sir Paul repaired to his library, where lord Mortimer was expecting him in a &s;ituation of no le&s;s embara&s;&s;ment, having conned over a &s;peech for the purpo&s;e of introdu|cing a propo&s;al for an alliance between the fami|lies, and with a view to &s;ound how Sir Paul might &s;tand affected towards a match between his &s;on Lionel and Mi&s;s Rachel.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the fir&s;t ceremonies were over, which were not very &s;peedily di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, as both parties were &s;trict ob&s;ervers of the old rules of breeding, his lord&s;hip began after his manner to wind about by way of reconnoitring his ground, and having compo&s;ed his features with much gravity and deliberation, began to open his honourable trenches as follows&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"In very truth, Sir Paul, I
<PB N="290" REF="296">
prote&s;t to you there are few things in life can give me more plea&s;ure than to find my &s;on Lionel &s;o a&s;&s;iduous in his vi&s;its to this fa|mily."</Q>&mdash;The baronet, who&s;e mind at this moment was not capable of adverting to any other idea but what had reference to his own jealou&s;y, &s;tared with amazement at this unex|pected addre&s;s and was &s;taggered how to reply to it; at la&s;t with much he&s;itation in a tone of ill-counterfeited raillery he replied that he truly believed there was one per&s;on in his family, to whom Mr. Lionel's vi&s;its were particularly ac|ceptable; and as this was a &s;ubject very near his heart, nay, that alone upon which the honour and happine&s;s of him and his family depended, he a&s;&s;ured his lord&s;hip that it was with avidity he embraced the opportunity of coming to an explanation, which he hoped would be as confi|dential on his lord&s;hip's part, as it &s;hould be on his own. There was &s;omething in the manner of Sir Paul's delivery, as well as in the matter of the &s;peech it&s;elf, which alarmed the hereditary pride of the old peer, who drawing him&s;elf up with great dignity ob&s;erved to Sir Paul, that for his &s;on Lionel he had this to &s;ay, that want of honour was never among&s;t his failings; nay it was never to be charged with impunity again&s;t

any member of his family, and that to prevent any imputation of this &s;ort from being grounded upon his &s;on's a&s;&s;iduities to a certain lady, he had now &s;ought this interview and explanation with his good friend and neighbour.</P>
<P>This was &s;o kind a lift in Sir Paul's concep|tion towards his favourite point, that he immedi|ately exclaimed&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I &s;ee your lord&s;hip is not unappri&s;ed of what is too con&s;picuous to be overlooked by any body, who is familiar in this hou&s;e; but as I know your lord&s;hip is a man of the nice&s;t honour in your own per&s;on, I &s;hould hold my&s;elf e&s;&s;entially bound to you, if you would prevail upon your &s;on to adopt the like principles towards a certain lady un|der this roof, and caution him to de&s;i&s;t from tho&s;e a&s;&s;iduities, which you your&s;elf have noticed, and which to confe&s;s the truth to you I cannot be a witne&s;s to without very great unea&s;ine&s;s and di&s;content."</Q></P>
<P>Upon the&s;e words the peer &s;tarted from his &s;eat as nimbly as age would permit him, and with great firmne&s;s replied&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Sir Paul Te&s;ty, if this be your wi&s;h and de&s;ire, let me a&s;&s;ure you, it &s;hall be mine al&s;o; my &s;on's vi&s;its in this family will never be repeated; &s;et your

<P><Q REND="inline">"My lord,"</Q> an&s;wered the baronet,
<Q REND="inline">"I am penetrated with the &s;en&s;e of your very honour|able proceedings, and the warmth with which you have expre&s;&s;ed your&s;elf on a &s;ubject &s;o clo&s;ely interwoven with my peace of mind; you have ea&s;ed my heart of it's burthen and I &s;hall ever be mo&s;t grateful to you for it."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Sir,"</Q> replied the peer,
<Q REND="inline">"there is more than enough &s;aid on the &s;ubject; I dare &s;ay my &s;on will &s;urvive his di&s;appointment."&mdash;</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"I dare &s;ay he will,"</Q>
&s;aid Sir Paul,
<Q REND="inline">"I cannot doubt the &s;ucce&s;s of Mr. Lionel's attentions; I have only to hope he will direct them to &s;ome other object."</Q></P>
<P>Lord Mortimer now muttered &s;omething, which Sir Paul did not hear, nor perhaps attend to, and took a ha&s;ty leave. When it is explained to the reader that Mi&s;s Rachel had never, even in the mo&s;t di&s;tant manner, hinted the &s;ituation of her heart to her brother, on the contrary had indu&s;triou&s;ly concealed it from him, this <HI>mal|entendu</HI> will not appear out of nature and proba|bility. Lionel, who&s;e little gallantries with Loui&s;a had not gone far enough &s;eriou&s;ly to en|gage
<PB N="293" REF="299">
his heart, was &s;ufficiently tired of his mer|cenary attachment to Mi&s;s Rachel; &s;o that he patiently &s;ubmitted to his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion and readily obeyed his father's commands by a total di&s;con|tinuance of his vi&s;its to Sir Paul: To the ladies of the family this behaviour appeared alto|gether my&s;terious; Sir Paul kept the &s;ecret to him&s;elf, and watched Loui&s;a very narrowly; when he found &s;he took no other notice of Lionel's neglect, than by &s;lightly remarking that &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed he was more agreeably engaged, he began to di&s;mi&s;s his jealou&s;y and regain his &s;pirits.</P>
<P>It was far otherwi&s;e with the unhappy Rachel; her heart was on the rack, for though &s;he na|turally &s;u&s;pected her brother's jealou&s;y of being the cau&s;e of Lionel's ab&s;ence, yet &s;he could not account for his &s;ilence towards her&s;elf in any other way than by &s;uppo&s;ing that Loui&s;a had totally drawn off his affections from her, and this was agony not to be &s;upported; day after day pa&s;&s;ed in anxious expectation of a letter to explain this cruel neglect, but none came; all communication with the whole family of lord Mortimer was at a &s;top; no intelligence could be obtained from that quarter, and to all &s;uch enquiries as &s;he ventured to try upon her brother,
<PB N="294" REF="300">
he an&s;wered &s;o drily, that &s;he could gather no|thing from him: In the mean time as he became hourly better reconciled to Loui&s;a, &s;o he grew more and more cool to the mi&s;erable Rachel, who now too late di&s;covered the fatal con&s;equences of interfering between hu&s;band and wife, and heartily reproached her&s;elf for her officiou&s;ne&s;s in aggravating his jealou&s;y.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t &s;he was tormenting her&s;elf with the&s;e reflections, and when Loui&s;a &s;eemed to have for|gotten that ever &s;uch a per&s;on as Lionel exi&s;ted, a report was circulated that he was about to be married to a certain lady of great rank and for|tune, and that he had gone up with lord Mor|timer to town for that purpo&s;e. There wanted only this blow to make Rachel's agonies com|pleat; in a &s;tate of mind little &s;hort of phren&s;y &s;he betook her&s;elf to her chamber, and there &s;hutting her&s;elf up &s;he gave vent to her pa&s;&s;ion in a letter fully charged with complaints and re|proaches, which &s;he committed to a tru&s;ty me&s;|&s;enger with &s;trict injunctions to deliver it into Lionel's own hand, and return with his an&s;wer: This commi&s;&s;ion was faithfully performed, and the following is the an&s;wer &s;he received in return.&mdash;</P>

<P>A Deli&s;a po&s;&s;e&s;t of beauty, fortune, rank, and every elegant accompli&s;hment, that genius and education could be&s;tow, was withal &s;o un|&s;upportably capricious, that &s;he &s;eemed born to be the torment of every heart, which &s;uffered it&s;elf to be attracted by her charms. Though her coquetry was notorious to a proverb, &s;uch were her allurements, that very few, upon whom &s;he thought fit to practi&s;e them, had ever found re&s;olution to re&s;i&s;t their power. Of all the vic|tims of her vanity Leander &s;eemed to be that
<PB N="297" REF="303">
over whom &s;he threw her chains with the greate&s;t air of triumph; he was indeed a con|que&s;t to boa&s;t of, for he had long and ob&s;tinately defended his heart, and for a time made as many repri&s;als upon the tender pa&s;&s;ions of her &s;ex as &s;he rai&s;ed contributions upon his: Her better &s;tar at length prevailed; &s;he beheld Leander at her feet, and though her victory was accompli&s;hed at the expence of more tender glances, than &s;he had ever be&s;towed upon the whole &s;ex collec|tively, yet it was a victory, which only piqued Adeli&s;a to render his &s;lavery the more intolerable for the trouble it had co&s;t her to reduce him to it. After &s;he had trifled with him and tortured him in every way that her ingenious malice could devi&s;e, and made &s;uch public di&s;play of her ty|ranny, as &s;ubjected him to the ridicule and con|tempt of all the men, who had envied his &s;uc|ce&s;s, and every woman, who re&s;ented his neglect, Adeli&s;a avowedly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him as an object which could no longer furni&s;h &s;port to her cruelty, and turned to other pur&s;uits with a kind of indifference as to the choice of them, which &s;eemed to have no other guide but mere ca|price.</P>
<P>Leander was not wanting to him&s;elf in the efforts he now made to free him&s;elf from her
<PB N="298" REF="304">
chains; but it was in vain; the hand of beauty had wrapped them too clo&s;ely about his heart, and love had rivetted them too &s;ecurely, for rea&s;on, pride or even the &s;tronge&s;t &s;truggles of re&s;entment to throw them off; he continued to love, to hate, to execrate and adore her. His fir&s;t re&s;olution was to exile him&s;elf from her &s;ight; this was a mea&s;ure of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, for he was not yet recovered enough to abide the chance of meet|ing her, and he had neither &s;pirits nor inclina|tion to &s;tart a fre&s;h attachment by way of experi|ment upon her jealou&s;y. Fortune however be|friended him in the very moment of de&s;pair, for no &s;ooner was he out of her &s;ight, than the co|quetti&s;h Adeli&s;a found &s;omething wanting, which had been &s;o familiar to her, that Leander, though de&s;pi&s;ed when po&s;&s;e&s;t, when lo&s;t was regretted. In vain &s;he culled her numerous admirers for &s;ome one to replace him; continually peevi&s;h and di&s;contented Adeli&s;a became &s;o intolerable to her lovers, that there &s;eemed to be a &s;pirit conjuring up among&s;t them, which threatened her with a general de&s;ertion. What was to be done? Her danger was alarming, it was immi|nent: She determined to recall Leander: She informed her&s;elf of his haunts, and threw her&s;elf in the way of a rencontre; but he avoided her:
<PB N="299" REF="305">
Chance brought them to an interview, and &s;he began by rallying him for his apo&s;tacy: There was an anxiety under all this affected plea&s;antry, that &s;he could not thoroughly conceal, and he did not fail to di&s;cover: He in&s;tantly determined upon the very wi&s;e&s;t mea&s;ure, which deliberation could have formed; he combated her with her own weapons; he put him&s;elf apparently &s;o much at his ea&s;e and counterfeited his part &s;o well, as effectually to deceive her: &s;he had now a new ta&s;k upon her hands and the harde&s;t as well as the mo&s;t hazardous &s;he had ever under|taken: She attempted to throw him off his guard by a pretended pity for his pa&s;t &s;ufferings and a promi&s;e of kinder u&s;age for the future: He denied that he had &s;uffered any thing, and a&s;&s;ured her that he never failed to be amu&s;ed by her humours, which were perfectly agreeable to him at all times.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Then it is plain,"</Q> replied &s;he,
<Q REND="inline">"that you never thought of me as a wife; for &s;uch humours mu&s;t be in&s;upportable to a hu&s;band."&mdash;</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"Pardon me,"</Q> cried Leander,
<Q REND="inline">"if ever I &s;hould be betrayed into the idle act of marriage, I mu&s;t be in one of tho&s;e very humours my&s;elf: Defend me from the dull uniformity of dome&s;tic life! What can be &s;o in&s;ipid as the tame &s;train of nuptial har|mony

everla&s;tingly repeated? Whatever other varieties I may then debar my&s;elf of, let me at lea&s;t find a variety of whim in the woman I am to be fettered to."&mdash;</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"Upon my word,"</Q> exclaimed Adeli&s;a,
<Q REND="inline">"you would almo&s;t per&s;uade me that we were de&s;tined for each other."</Q>&mdash;This &s;he accompanied with one of tho&s;e looks, in which &s;he was mo&s;t expert, and which was calculated at once to in&s;pire and to betray &s;en&s;i|bility: Leander, not yet &s;o certain of his ob&s;er|vations as to confide in them, &s;eemed to receive this ouverture as a raillery and affecting a laugh, replied&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I do not think it is in the power of de&s;tiny her&s;elf to determine either of us; for if you was for one moment in the humour to promi&s;e your&s;elf to me, I am certain in the next you would retract it; and if I was fool enough to believe you, I &s;hould well de&s;erve to be puni&s;hed for my credulity: Hymen will never yoak us to each other, nor to any body el&s;e; but if you are in the mind to make a very harmle&s;s experiment of the little faith I put in all &s;uch promi&s;es, here is my hand; 'tis fit the propo&s;al &s;hould &s;pring from my quarter and not your's; clo&s;e with it as &s;oon as you plea&s;e, and laugh at me as much as you plea&s;e, if I vent one murmur when you break the
<PB N="301" REF="307">
bargain."&mdash;</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"Well then,"</Q> &s;aid Adeli&s;a,
<Q REND="inline">"to puni&s;h you for the &s;aucine&s;s of your provok|ing challenge, and to convince you that I do not credit you for this pretended indifference to my treatment of you, here is my hand, and with it my promi&s;e; and now I give you warn|ing, that if ever I do keep it, 'twill be only from the conviction that I &s;hall torment you more by fulfilling it than by flying from it."&mdash;</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"Fairly declared,"</Q> cried Leander,
<Q REND="inline">"and &s;ince my word is pa&s;&s;ed, I'll &s;tand to it; but take notice, if I was not perfectly &s;ecure of being jilted, I &s;hould think my&s;elf in a fair way to be the mo&s;t egregious dupe in nature."</Q></P>
<P>In this &s;train of mutual raillery they proceeded to &s;ettle the mo&s;t &s;erious bu&s;ine&s;s of their lives, and whil&s;t neither would venture upon a confe&s;|&s;ion of their pa&s;&s;ion, each &s;eemed to rely upon the other for a di&s;covery of it. They now broke up their conference in the gaye&s;t &s;pirits imaginable, and Leander upon parting offered to make a bett of half his fortune with Adeli&s;a that &s;he did not &s;tand to her engagement, at the &s;ame time naming a certain day as the period of its taking place.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"And what &s;hall I gain,"</Q> &s;aid &s;he,
<Q REND="inline">"in that ca&s;e by half your fortune, when I &s;hall have a joint &s;hare in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the

<Q REND="inline">"Talk not of fortune,"</Q> cried Leander, giving loo&s;e to the rapture which he could no longer re&s;train,
<Q REND="inline">"my heart, my happi|ne&s;s, my life it&s;elf is your's."</Q>&mdash;So &s;aying he caught her in his arms, pre&s;&s;ed her eagerly in his embrace, and ha&s;tily departed.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was he out of her &s;ight than he began to expo&s;tulate with him&s;elf upon his indi&s;|cretion: In the ec&s;tacy of one unguarded mo|ment he had bla&s;ted all his &s;chemes, and by ex|po&s;ing his weakne&s;s armed her with fre&s;h en|gines to torment him. In the&s;e reflections he pa&s;&s;ed the remainder of the night; in vain he &s;trove to find &s;ome ju&s;tification for his folly; he could not form his mind to believe that the ten|der looks &s;he had be&s;towed upon him were any other than an experiment upon his heart to throw him from his guard and ree&s;tabli&s;h her tyranny. With the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions he pre&s;ented him&s;elf at her door next morning and was immediately admitted; Adeli&s;a was alone, and Leander im|mediately began by &s;aying to her&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I am now come to receive at your hands the puni&s;hment, which a man who cannot keep his own &s;ecret richly de&s;erves; I &s;urrender my&s;elf to you, and I expect you will exert your utmo&s;t in|genuity in tormenting me; only remember
<PB N="303" REF="309">
that you cannot give a &s;tab to my heart with|out wounding your own image, which enve|lopes every part, and is too deeply impre&s;t for even your cruelty totally to extirpate."</Q>&mdash;At the conclu&s;ion of this &s;peech, Adeli&s;a's counte|nance became &s;erious; &s;he fixt her eyes upon the floor and after a pau&s;e without taking any notice of Leander, and as if &s;he had been talking to her&s;elf in &s;oliloquy repeated in a murmuring tone&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Well, well, 'tis all over; but no mat|ter."&mdash;</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"For the love of Heaven,"</Q> cried Leander in alarm, <Q REND="inline">"what is all over?"&mdash;</Q><Q REND="inline">"All that is mo&s;t delightful to woman,"</Q>
&s;he replied;

Believe me, Leander, I never was a coquette but in &s;elf-defence; &s;incerity is my natural character; but how &s;hould a woman of any attractions be &s;afe in &s;uch a character, when the whole circle of fa&s;hion abounds with artificial coxcombs, pretenders to &s;entiment

and profe&s;&s;ors of &s;eduction? When the whole world is in arms again&s;t innocence, what is to become of the naked children of nature, if experience does not teach them the art of de|fence? If I have employed this art more par|ticularly again&s;t you than others, why have I &s;o done, but becau&s;e I had more to apprehend from your in&s;incerity than any other per&s;on's, and proportioned my defences to my danger? Between you and me, Leander, it has been more a conte&s;t of cunning than an affair of honour, and if you will call your own conduct into fair review, tru&s;t me you will find little rea&s;on to complain of mine. Naturally di&s;|po&s;ed to favour your attentions more than any other man's, it particularly behoved me to guard my&s;elf again&s;t propen&s;ities at once &s;o plea&s;ing and &s;o &s;u&s;picious. Let this &s;uffice in ju&s;tification of what is pa&s;t; it now remains that I &s;hould explain to you the &s;y&s;tem I have laid down for the time to come: If ever I a&s;&s;ume the character of a wife, I devote my&s;elf to all it's duties; I bid farewell at once to all the vanities, the petulancies, the coquetries of what is fal&s;ely called a life of plea&s;ure; the whole &s;y&s;tem mu&s;t undergo a revolution and be admini&s;tered upon other principles and to

other purpo&s;es: I know the world too well to commit my&s;elf to it, when I have more than my own con&s;cience to account to, when I have not only truths but the &s;imilitudes of truths to &s;tudy; &s;u&s;picions, jealou&s;ies, appearances to provide again&s;t; when I am no longer &s;ingly re&s;pon&s;ible on the &s;core of error, but of example al&s;o: It is not therefore in the public di&s;play of an affluent fortune, in dre&s;s, equipage, en|tertainments, nor even in the fame of &s;plendid charities my plea&s;ures will be found; they will center in dome&s;tic occupations; in cultivating nature and the &s;ons of nature, in benefiting the tenants and labourers of the &s;oil that &s;upplies us with the means of being u&s;eful; in living hap|pily with my neighbours, in availing my&s;elf of tho&s;e numberle&s;s opportunities, which a re&s;i|dence in the country affords of relieving the un|told di&s;tre&s;&s;es of tho&s;e, who &s;uffer in &s;ecret, and are too humble or perhaps too proud to a&s;k."</Q>&mdash;Here the enraptured Leander could no longer keep &s;ilence, but breaking forth into tran&s;ports of love and admiration, gave a turn to the con|ver&s;ation, which it is no otherwi&s;e intere&s;ting to relate than as it proved the prelude to an union which &s;peedily took place and has made Leander and Adeli&s;a the fonde&s;t and the worthie&s;t couple in England.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="312">From Adeli&s;a's example I would willingly e&s;tabli&s;h this conclu&s;ion, that the characters of young unmarried women, who are objects of admiration, are not to be decided upon by the appearances, which they are oftentimes tempted to a&s;&s;ume upon the plea of &s;elf-defence: I would not be under&s;tood by this to recommend di&s;gui&s;e in any &s;hape, or to ju&s;tify tho&s;e who re&s;ort to arti|fice upon the pretended nece&s;&s;ity of the mea&s;ure; but I am thoroughly di&s;po&s;ed to believe that the triflings and di&s;&s;emblings of the young and fair do not &s;o often flow from the real levity of their natures, as they are thought to do: Tho&s;e in particular, who&s;e &s;ituation throws them into the vortex of the fa&s;hion, have much that might be &s;aid in palliation of appearances. Many co|quettes be&s;ides Adeli&s;a have become admirable wives and mothers, and how very many more might have approved them&s;elves &s;uch, had they fallen into the hands of men of worth and good &s;en&s;e, is a conjecture, which leads to the mo&s;t melancholy reflections. There is &s;o little hono|rable love in the men of high life before mar|riage, and &s;o much infidelity after it, that the hu&s;band is almo&s;t in every in&s;tance the cor|rupter of his wife.

<PB N="307" REF="313">
animal; a &s;illy idea prevails that &s;he is to lead a hu&s;band into certain ruin and di&s;grace: Parents in general &s;eem agreed in exerting all their influence and authority for keeping her out of their families; in place of whom they fre|quently obtrude upon their &s;ons &s;ome raw and inexperienced thing, whom they figure to them|&s;elves as a creature of perfect innocence and &s;implicity, a wife who may be modelled to the wi&s;hes of her hu&s;band, who&s;e manners are un|tainted by the vices of the age, and on who&s;e purity, fidelity and affection he may repo&s;e his happine&s;s for the re&s;t of his days. Alas! how gro&s;sly they misjudge their own true intere&s;ts in the ca&s;e: How dangerous is the &s;ituation of the&s;e children of the nur&s;ery at their fir&s;t introduction into the world! Tho&s;e only who are unacquaint|ed with the deceitfulne&s;s of plea&s;ure can be thoroughly intoxicated by it; it is the novelty which makes the danger; and &s;urely it requires infinitely more judgment, &s;tronger re&s;olutions and clo&s;er attentions to &s;teer the conduct of a young wife without experience, than would &s;erve to detach the woman of the world from frivolities &s;he is &s;urfeited with, and by fixing her to your intere&s;ts convert what you have thought a di&s;&s;i|pated character into a dome&s;tic one.</P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="314">The &s;ame remark applies to young men of private education: you keep them in ab&s;olute &s;ubjection till they marry, and then in a moment make them their own ma&s;ters; from mere in|fancy you expect them to &s;tep at once into per|fect manhood: The motives for the experiment may be virtuous, but the effects of it will be fatal.</P>
